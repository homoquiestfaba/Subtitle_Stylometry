- Quick, Lieutenant Silver.

25
00:02:00,092 --> 00:02:03,311
Go back to the front and take
control of the plasma cannon,

26
00:02:03,311 --> 00:02:05,910
it's the only way the commandos can land.

27
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,547
- Roger, Captain Gold, cover me.

28
00:02:08,547 --> 00:02:10,614
- [Both] Kill the mutants.

29
00:02:10,614 --> 00:02:13,864

30
00:02:17,722 --> 00:02:18,827
(indistinct television chatter)

31
00:02:18,827 --> 00:02:19,660
- What I'd miss?

32
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:22,341
- Fourth down, they're going for it.

33
00:02:22,341 --> 00:02:24,354
- Not a chance.

34
00:02:24,354 --> 00:02:27,617
- [Man] Look at that hole, he's got it!

35
00:02:27,617 --> 00:02:28,867
- Go, go, yeah.

36
00:02:29,761 --> 00:02:30,594
- Yes.

37
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:36,443
- Nothing really, just
an unassuming Chardonay.

38
00:02:36,443 --> 00:02:38,919
- Hey Irwin, they just scored finally.

39
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:40,335
- Thank god, how are you, David?

40
00:02:40,335 --> 00:02:41,168
- Good, good, good.

41
00:02:41,168 --> 00:02:42,234
How was the traffic?

42
00:02:42,234 --> 00:02:43,252
- You're pulling us away from the party?

43
00:02:43,252 --> 00:02:45,265
What is your problem?

44
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:47,197
- Hi dad, happy thanksgiving.

45
00:02:47,197 --> 00:02:48,106
- Happy thanksgiving.

46
00:02:48,106 --> 00:02:49,507
Where's my little buddy?

47
00:02:49,507 --> 00:02:51,827
- He and Bobby are
upstairs saving the galaxy.

48
00:02:51,827 --> 00:02:55,170
- Bobby and the whole
trainwreck family, I see.

49
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,253
- Dad, please.

50
00:02:56,253 --> 00:02:57,676
They are going through
a rough time right now.

51
00:02:57,676 --> 00:02:59,421
They need us to be there for them.

52
00:02:59,421 --> 00:03:00,254
As a matter of fact,

53
00:03:00,254 --> 00:03:02,768
why don't you go in there
and share some of that,

54
00:03:02,768 --> 00:03:04,546
shall we call it, "wisdom" with them?

55
00:03:04,546 --> 00:03:05,379
- No, please.

56
00:03:05,379 --> 00:03:07,462
- Come on, come on.

57
00:03:07,462 --> 00:03:10,462
(angry whispering )

58
00:03:12,832 --> 00:03:15,030
David, go upstairs and tell the commandos

59
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:17,114
to keep the peace, please?

60
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:18,606
- Steph, the game is on!

61
00:03:18,606 --> 00:03:20,868
Guys, hey, keep it down!

62
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:21,905
Bring it down.

63
00:03:21,905 --> 00:03:25,572
- [Stephanie] I could
have done that, David.

64
00:03:28,798 --> 00:03:32,493
- Calling Major Titanium,
fire the neutron beam.

65
00:03:32,493 --> 00:03:34,576
- Beep, beep, beep, beep.

66
00:03:41,134 --> 00:03:43,551
- Justin, calm down up there!

67
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:47,792
Would you like to adopt
an eight-year-old tornado?

68
00:03:47,792 --> 00:03:50,973
- I'd love to, but you
would never give him up.

69
00:03:50,973 --> 00:03:53,058
- Make me an offer today.

70
00:03:53,058 --> 00:03:54,225
- Oh, come on!

71
00:03:55,572 --> 00:03:57,312
Can you believe this?

72
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59,455
- You know, I just don't get football.

73
00:03:59,455 --> 00:04:03,455
- That, girlfriend, is
why you are still single.

74
00:04:04,794 --> 00:04:06,877
What do you think of Sal?

75
00:04:09,997 --> 00:04:14,163
- He's kind of cute, in a
rough and tumble kind of way.

76
00:04:14,163 --> 00:04:16,177
I don't think he's my type, though.

77
00:04:16,177 --> 00:04:17,010
- No?

78
00:04:24,237 --> 00:04:26,912
- You're so much like your
father, you make me sick!

79
00:04:26,912 --> 00:04:29,091
- Don't bring my parents into this!

80
00:04:29,091 --> 00:04:31,246
- So, Sal, how's business?

81
00:04:31,246 --> 00:04:34,663
- It's busy, it's nothing I can't handle.

82
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,323
- All right, let's go.

83
00:04:40,323 --> 00:04:41,568
- The evil suck brain!

84
00:04:41,568 --> 00:04:42,901
Run, lieutenant!

85
00:04:43,782 --> 00:04:45,528
- Blast them!

86
00:04:45,528 --> 00:04:47,896
- [Announcer] Attention,
Stellarian space commandos!

87
00:04:47,896 --> 00:04:52,557
From the forces of Alarius,
comes The Armor of Heroes!

88
00:04:52,557 --> 00:04:54,041
- Whoa!

89
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:55,604
- No way!

90
00:04:55,604 --> 00:04:57,419
- [Announcer] With these
weapons of galactic peace,

91
00:04:57,419 --> 00:05:00,275
you too can defend the world
against the evil alliance.

92
00:05:00,275 --> 00:05:02,585
Join Major Titanium and
the forces of Bronze,

93
00:05:02,585 --> 00:05:06,144
Silver or Gold Battalions, to
keep our galaxy mutant-free!

00:05:06,144 --> 00:05:07,992
Get the Stellarian Space Commando armor

95
00:05:07,992 --> 00:05:09,470

- [Both] Mum!

107
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:40,611
- It smells ready.

108
00:05:40,611 --> 00:05:42,028
- It looks great.

109
00:05:43,915 --> 00:05:44,966
- Mum, mum, great news!

110
00:05:44,966 --> 00:05:45,799
- What, honey?

111
00:05:45,799 --> 00:05:47,820
- They got Stellarian commando stuff

112
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,271
you can put on and wear!

113
00:05:49,271 --> 00:05:50,956
- And real plasma guns!

114
00:05:50,956 --> 00:05:53,539
- Okay, not now, go tell daddy.

115
00:05:56,484 --> 00:05:59,808
(men groaning)

116
00:05:59,808 --> 00:06:00,766
- No, not again!

117
00:06:00,766 --> 00:06:01,599
- Dad, dad!

118
00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:03,497
- Hey, buddy, say hi to your grandpa.

119
00:06:03,497 --> 00:06:06,249
- Hey partner, where have
you been hiding, huh?

120
00:06:06,249 --> 00:06:07,968
- Hi, grandpa.

121
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:09,337
- If it's not one
accusation, it's another.

122
00:06:09,337 --> 00:06:10,170
- Mum, mum!

123
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:12,860
They got Stellarian battle
stuff and plasma guns.

124
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,388
- What, honey?

125
00:06:14,388 --> 00:06:15,584
- You listen to him.

126
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:18,003
- Our son is trying to tell us something.

127
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:19,076
Do you mind?

128
00:06:19,076 --> 00:06:20,501
- Dad, it's the coolest thing.

129
00:06:20,501 --> 00:06:23,120
They got bronze, silver and gold.

130
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,598
- Your mummy and I are in
the middle of a discussion.

131
00:06:25,598 --> 00:06:27,458
Tell us about it later.

132
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:28,563
- Go play.

133
00:06:28,563 --> 00:06:30,640
- The plasma gun is the only defense

134
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,865
against the evil space mutants.

135
00:06:32,865 --> 00:06:34,224
- Maybe if you're a good boy,

136
00:06:34,224 --> 00:06:36,444
I'll put in a good word to Santa.

137
00:06:36,444 --> 00:06:37,277
- Really?

138
00:06:37,277 --> 00:06:39,213
I forgot to write to him!

139
00:06:39,213 --> 00:06:41,023
- We'll see.

140
00:06:41,023 --> 00:06:42,761
- Okay, everybody, the turkey is ready.

141
00:06:42,761 --> 00:06:44,989
Come on, wash up!

142
00:06:44,989 --> 00:06:46,572
- I'm gonna go eat!

143
00:06:51,196 --> 00:06:53,556
- [TV Commentator] For
more textbook offense.

144
00:06:53,556 --> 00:06:55,306
The kind that makes--

145
00:06:59,887 --> 00:07:01,438
- You think things are going to get ugly?

146
00:07:01,438 --> 00:07:02,505
- Think positive.

147
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:05,227
If they start fighting,
I'll pull the choking act.

148
00:07:05,227 --> 00:07:06,644
- Don't you dare.

149
00:07:07,867 --> 00:07:10,495
Justin, do you want to say grace?

150
00:07:10,495 --> 00:07:11,328
- Oh, mum.

151
00:07:12,341 --> 00:07:13,676
- I'll say it, grace.

152
00:07:13,676 --> 00:07:14,914
Let's eat.

153
00:07:14,914 --> 00:07:16,523
(adults chuckle)

154
00:07:16,523 --> 00:07:17,692
- Why don't we go around the table

155
00:07:17,692 --> 00:07:20,495
and everybody says something
they're grateful for?

156
00:07:20,495 --> 00:07:22,057
- Okay, but first, I think Justin

157
00:07:22,057 --> 00:07:24,246
does want to start off with
grace, don't you, buddy?

158
00:07:24,246 --> 00:07:27,785
- Okay, "rub-a-dub dub,
thanks for the grub!

159
00:07:27,785 --> 00:07:29,022
Yay, God!

160
00:07:29,022 --> 00:07:29,855
- Amen!

161
00:07:29,855 --> 00:07:31,013
- [Stephanie] Justin!

162
00:07:31,013 --> 00:07:32,453
- Okay, okay.

163
00:07:32,453 --> 00:07:36,696
Dear Lord, thank you for these
gifts we are about to receive

164
00:07:36,696 --> 00:07:39,588
and for all those here
to share it with us.

165
00:07:39,588 --> 00:07:41,119
Amen.

166
00:07:41,119 --> 00:07:43,015
- [All] Amen!

167
00:07:43,015 --> 00:07:46,965
- Well, I'm thankful to have
a real family thanksgiving.

168
00:07:46,965 --> 00:07:48,485
It's been a long time.

169
00:07:48,485 --> 00:07:51,485
- Hear, hear, to family and friends.

170
00:07:52,603 --> 00:07:55,197
- [David] To family and friends.

171
00:07:55,197 --> 00:07:57,339
- [Stephanie] I agree.

172
00:07:57,339 --> 00:08:00,362
- What about you, Sal,
what are you thankful for?

173
00:08:00,362 --> 00:08:02,753
- I'm thankful our team
covered the spread.

174
00:08:02,753 --> 00:08:03,586
- Lovely.

175
00:08:03,586 --> 00:08:05,184
- Such holiday spirit.

176
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:07,017
- Hey, I won 50 bucks!

177
00:08:11,795 --> 00:08:14,796
- Felix, Marie, would you
like to add something?

178
00:08:14,796 --> 00:08:18,396
- Well, I guess I'm thankful for--

179
00:08:18,396 --> 00:08:20,313
- This is not the time.

180
00:08:22,067 --> 00:08:25,734
- Felix and I have
decided to get a divorce.

181
00:08:30,284 --> 00:08:33,284
(melancholic music)

182
00:08:45,999 --> 00:08:46,832
- Turkey?

183
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:01,331
- Amen.

184
00:09:10,966 --> 00:09:12,767
- Alright, let's see.

185
00:09:12,767 --> 00:09:15,759
You have picked up your toys,

186
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:18,592
washed up, you brushed your teeth?

187
00:09:19,923 --> 00:09:23,840
Well, finish the job, go
on and check them off.

188
00:09:25,403 --> 00:09:27,834
- Tough day for a thanksgiving, huh?

189
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:29,806
- Do you think Bobby's okay?

190
00:09:29,806 --> 00:09:31,473
- Yeah, he's strong.

191
00:09:33,644 --> 00:09:35,619
He's going to be just fine.

192
00:09:35,619 --> 00:09:37,855
- He was acting kind of weird.

193
00:09:37,855 --> 00:09:40,567
- Oh, he's just hurting, Justin.

194
00:09:40,567 --> 00:09:44,731
Sometimes it's easier to hide
our feelings when it hurts.

195
00:09:44,731 --> 00:09:47,614
- What do you think will
happen to his mum and dad?

196
00:09:47,614 --> 00:09:48,967
- Sometimes, Justin, people,

197
00:09:48,967 --> 00:09:52,134
even good people like Bobby's parents,

198
00:09:53,103 --> 00:09:55,086
just can't get along.

199
00:09:55,086 --> 00:09:57,063
- You guys get along, right?

200
00:09:57,063 --> 00:10:00,784
- Yes Justin, your mum and
dad get along just fine.

201
00:10:00,784 --> 00:10:02,066
You know that.

202
00:10:02,066 --> 00:10:04,707
Nothing in this world
could break us apart.

203
00:10:04,707 --> 00:10:06,166
- That's right, kid.

204
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:09,249
Like it or not, you're stuck with us.

205
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:12,733
- Good.

206
00:10:12,733 --> 00:10:16,031
- Okay, time for you to go to sleep.

207
00:10:16,031 --> 00:10:19,203
- Hey, that's right,
what about Santa Claus?

208
00:10:19,203 --> 00:10:21,638
It's a month until Christmas.

209
00:10:21,638 --> 00:10:23,222
- Okay, good night.

210
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:24,305
- Good night.

211
00:10:25,199 --> 00:10:26,782
- Okay, good night.

212
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:45,972
(cheerful Christmas music)

213
00:10:47,912 --> 00:10:49,579
- Isn't that pretty?

214
00:11:09,638 --> 00:11:10,791
- So, what happened?

215
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:12,685
- I don't know, I went to bed.

216
00:11:12,685 --> 00:11:13,894
- They sent you to bed?

217
00:11:13,894 --> 00:11:15,208
- No, I went on my own.

218
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:18,015
I was tired, they were arguing.

219
00:11:18,015 --> 00:11:20,587
- Do you really think
they're going to, you know.

220
00:11:20,587 --> 00:11:21,420
- Divorce?

221
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,192
Yeah, I guess so.

222
00:11:23,192 --> 00:11:24,596
- Can they do that?

223
00:11:24,596 --> 00:11:27,124
- They're grownups, they
can do whatever they want.

224
00:11:27,124 --> 00:11:28,457
- It's not fair.

225
00:11:29,727 --> 00:11:32,982
My mum said you can stay with
us a couple days, if you want.

226
00:11:32,982 --> 00:11:34,815
- No way, there it is!

227
00:11:35,823 --> 00:11:36,656
- Wow!

228
00:11:36,656 --> 00:11:37,556
- No way!

229
00:11:37,556 --> 00:11:38,529
- Wow!

230
00:11:38,529 --> 00:11:40,510
Oh, I hope Santa brings it.

231
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:41,706
- I know I'll get mine.

232
00:11:41,706 --> 00:11:43,241
- How do you know?

233
00:11:43,241 --> 00:11:44,933
- Grown-ups always give kids presents

234
00:11:44,933 --> 00:11:46,256
when they get a divorce.

235
00:11:46,256 --> 00:11:49,214
Larry got a new bike when
his parents broke up,

236
00:11:49,214 --> 00:11:51,075
and it wasn't even Christmas.

237
00:11:51,075 --> 00:11:52,032
- That makes sense.

238
00:11:52,032 --> 00:11:54,782
- [Driver] Morning, Mr. Thompson.

239
00:12:05,343 --> 00:12:06,673
- Come on.

240
00:12:06,673 --> 00:12:07,923
- I got it.

241
00:12:07,923 --> 00:12:10,232
- Good luck, Floyd, stay warm.

242
00:12:10,232 --> 00:12:13,399
- Bah, humbug, it's freezing out here.

243
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:17,903
- Here you go.

244
00:12:29,069 --> 00:12:29,902
- Ho, ho, ho.

245
00:12:29,902 --> 00:12:30,753
(bell ringing)

246
00:12:30,753 --> 00:12:31,586
- See ya!

247
00:12:33,826 --> 00:12:34,909
- Ho, ho, ho.

248
00:12:40,887 --> 00:12:42,304
- Stop it, Bobby!

249
00:12:43,731 --> 00:12:45,637
- [Teacher] Robert, don't make me send you

250
00:12:45,637 --> 00:12:47,743
to Mr. Hoke's office again.

251
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,431
- Dude, what are you doing?

252
00:12:49,431 --> 00:12:50,514
- Watch this.

253
00:12:52,274 --> 00:12:53,922
- Stop it, Bobby!

254
00:12:53,922 --> 00:12:56,482
- How do you expect Santa
to bring you anything

255
00:12:56,482 --> 00:12:59,081
if you keep getting sent
to the principal's office?

256
00:12:59,081 --> 00:13:01,930
- I don't have to worry
about Santa this year.

257
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:04,439
I got parental guilt on my side.

258
00:13:04,439 --> 00:13:06,826
- Quiet back there.

259
00:13:06,826 --> 00:13:08,635
- No, don't you get it?

260
00:13:08,635 --> 00:13:10,039
Maybe if you ask Santa

261
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,508
to get your mum and dad to stop fighting,

262
00:13:12,508 --> 00:13:15,114
you could even keep them together!

263
00:13:15,114 --> 00:13:17,653
- Hey, I never thought of that!

264
00:13:17,653 --> 00:13:21,281
- Okay, Robert, I warned you, let's go!

265
00:13:21,281 --> 00:13:22,114
- But--

266
00:13:22,114 --> 00:13:22,967
- No buts!

267
00:13:22,967 --> 00:13:24,948
To the office, young man!

268
00:13:24,948 --> 00:13:27,115
(teasing)

269
00:13:34,895 --> 00:13:37,077
- No, no, I'm not saying
we don't pay the mortgage.

270
00:13:37,077 --> 00:13:38,768
I'm just saying let's call the bank

271
00:13:38,768 --> 00:13:40,250
and see if we can make
some smaller payments

272
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,230
the next couple of months.

273
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,426
- Then what?

274
00:13:43,426 --> 00:13:44,595
- Then, I don't know.

275
00:13:44,595 --> 00:13:46,454
If they buy that, call them back and say,

276
00:13:46,454 --> 00:13:48,537
"start sending us money".

277
00:13:49,444 --> 00:13:51,226
- Not funny.

278
00:13:51,226 --> 00:13:54,073
I mean, we cannot borrow
against the house again.

279
00:13:54,073 --> 00:13:56,121
You have a truck payment due.

280
00:13:56,121 --> 00:13:57,692
The credit cards are maxed out.

281
00:13:57,692 --> 00:13:58,871
Really, what are we gonna do?

282
00:13:58,871 --> 00:13:59,704
- I don't know!

283
00:13:59,704 --> 00:14:00,787
I don't know!

284
00:14:06,355 --> 00:14:08,436
Is there any word on your promotion?

285
00:14:08,436 --> 00:14:09,596
- No.

286
00:14:09,596 --> 00:14:12,229
I'm hoping to find out
at this meeting tomorrow.

287
00:14:12,229 --> 00:14:14,041
- What about that remodeling job?

288
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:17,041
- Nothing, I haven't heard anything.

289
00:14:19,689 --> 00:14:22,772
- David, maybe you should talk to Sal

290
00:14:23,812 --> 00:14:26,193
about getting your old
job back and ask him--

291
00:14:26,193 --> 00:14:27,801
- Please, Stephanie, don't start that!

292
00:14:27,801 --> 00:14:29,218
Don't start that!

293
00:14:30,145 --> 00:14:32,040
Look, we've been through
this a thousand times!

294
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:32,873
No!

295
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:35,550
- I'm just saying until things pick up.

296
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,464
- Look, I didn't break my
back at this point in my life

297
00:14:37,464 --> 00:14:40,352
to get my contractor's license,
to start a new company,

298
00:14:40,352 --> 00:14:42,928
just to go crawling back to
Sal to get my old job back!

299
00:14:42,928 --> 00:14:43,963
No!

300
00:14:43,963 --> 00:14:45,859
- Well, maybe that was a mistake.

301
00:14:45,859 --> 00:14:47,686
- A mistake on something
that we both agreed

302
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:48,714
that would be best for us.

303
00:14:48,714 --> 00:14:49,997
- Well maybe we were wrong.

304
00:14:49,997 --> 00:14:52,601
- Is that what you think?

305
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:53,872
- I'm just saying.

306
00:14:53,872 --> 00:14:55,602
- I know what you're saying!

307
00:14:55,602 --> 00:14:56,435
I know.

308
00:14:57,825 --> 00:14:59,514
Look Stephanie, I know what you're saying.

309
00:14:59,514 --> 00:15:03,681
I just wish that you would
have a little faith in me.

310
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:07,655
- Honey, I have faith in you.

311
00:15:07,655 --> 00:15:10,065
I'm just trying to be realistic.

312
00:15:10,065 --> 00:15:11,670
You're the one who wanted this big house.

313
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,753
We have overextended ourselves.

314
00:15:13,753 --> 00:15:15,903
- What do you mean that
I wanted the house?

315
00:15:15,903 --> 00:15:18,794
First of all yeah, I wanted this house

316
00:15:18,794 --> 00:15:19,992
but you wanted it, too!

317
00:15:19,992 --> 00:15:22,247
We both walked in and
said, "this would be great.

318
00:15:22,247 --> 00:15:24,505
"This is a beautiful house," yes?

319
00:15:24,505 --> 00:15:28,298
Second of all, what is it that
you really expect me to do?

320
00:15:28,298 --> 00:15:31,511
Do you want me to have my own business

321
00:15:31,511 --> 00:15:33,909
for two, three months, four
months out of the year,

322
00:15:33,909 --> 00:15:35,527
and the rest of the time
I'm this worker bee,

323
00:15:35,527 --> 00:15:37,015
working for Sal?

324
00:15:37,015 --> 00:15:40,395
- Excuse me, I can be
a worker bee all year!

325
00:15:40,395 --> 00:15:43,327
It's not as glamorous as
starting your own business,

326
00:15:43,327 --> 00:15:46,708
but at least I put food on the table.

327
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,149
- What?

328
00:15:48,149 --> 00:15:49,316
Oh, thank you.

329
00:15:50,368 --> 00:15:53,010
That's perfect, thank you very much!

330
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,760
I really needed that.

331
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:58,761
- Oh David, don't be so--

332
00:15:58,761 --> 00:15:59,782
- Don't be so what?

333
00:15:59,782 --> 00:16:01,949
What, finish the sentence!

334
00:16:02,869 --> 00:16:05,379
- Where are you going?

335
00:16:05,379 --> 00:16:06,212
David!

336
00:16:07,188 --> 00:16:08,021
David.

337
00:16:27,425 --> 00:16:28,258
Okay.

338
00:16:30,398 --> 00:16:31,565
- Where's dad?

339
00:16:33,341 --> 00:16:37,252
- He went to the store to get some milk.

340
00:16:37,252 --> 00:16:38,788
- When is he coming back?

341
00:16:38,788 --> 00:16:41,038
- Soon, he'll be back soon.

342
00:16:45,777 --> 00:16:47,860
Okay, brush teeth, check.

343
00:16:49,534 --> 00:16:51,105
Say prayers?

344
00:16:51,105 --> 00:16:52,355
- I did it all.

345
00:16:54,773 --> 00:16:55,606
- Okay.

346
00:17:00,549 --> 00:17:01,532
Good night, Justin.

347
00:17:01,532 --> 00:17:02,726
- Night.

348
00:17:02,726 --> 00:17:04,226
- I love you tons.

349
00:17:18,503 --> 00:17:20,478
- [Marie] What difference does it make?

350
00:17:20,478 --> 00:17:22,689
We already decided, and all of a sudden,

351
00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:24,272
you want to keep it a secret.

352
00:17:24,272 --> 00:17:25,960
If you weren't so worried
about what people thought,

353
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,640
and cared about your family for a change.

354
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,082
- [Felix] That's not the point!

355
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:31,736
- [Marie] Then, what is the point?

356
00:17:31,736 --> 00:17:32,577
- [Felix] What are you talking about?

357
00:17:32,577 --> 00:17:34,269
- [Marie] When are you
going to give me a break?

358
00:17:34,269 --> 00:17:36,157
You decided to walk out the door,

359
00:17:36,157 --> 00:17:40,157
and expect me to pretend
that everything's okay?

360
00:18:31,847 --> 00:18:32,930
- Ho, ho, ho!

361
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:39,819
I know I'm a little early,
but is anybody ho-ho-ho-home?

362
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:40,736
Ho, ho, ho!

363
00:18:43,425 --> 00:18:45,696
- Well, if it isn't Santa.

364
00:18:45,696 --> 00:18:46,779
- Ho, ho, ho!

365
00:18:49,163 --> 00:18:51,676
What do you want for
Christmas, little girl?

366
00:18:51,676 --> 00:18:55,550
- Santa, I have been
a naughty little girl.

367
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:57,735
- Not as naughty as you're
going to be, I hope.

368
00:18:57,735 --> 00:18:58,652
Ho, ho, ho!

369
00:19:00,702 --> 00:19:01,702
- Oh, Santa.

370
00:19:04,014 --> 00:19:05,097
- Ho, ho, ho!

371
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:08,727
- Santa!

372
00:19:08,727 --> 00:19:09,810
- Ho, ho, ho!

373
00:19:11,605 --> 00:19:12,438
Where's my little elf?

374
00:19:12,438 --> 00:19:13,424
Oh, there you are.

375
00:19:13,424 --> 00:19:15,174
Come here, come here!

376
00:19:16,471 --> 00:19:18,471
- Bobby, Bobby, come in!

377
00:19:19,895 --> 00:19:21,058
- Go for Bobby!

378
00:19:21,058 --> 00:19:23,974
- Dude, you won't believe it,
Santa Claus is in my house!

379
00:19:23,974 --> 00:19:26,567
- No way, it's not even December.

380
00:19:26,567 --> 00:19:28,912
- I'm not kidding, he's downstairs!

381
00:19:28,912 --> 00:19:30,475
- Yeah, right.

382
00:19:30,475 --> 00:19:33,366
And Major Titanium is in my bathroom.

383
00:19:33,366 --> 00:19:35,054
- I'm serious!

384
00:19:35,054 --> 00:19:36,701
- Then prove it.

385
00:19:36,701 --> 00:19:37,534
- I will.

386
00:19:40,459 --> 00:19:41,459
Signing off.

387
00:19:46,094 --> 00:19:48,177
- I'm sorry about before.

388
00:19:49,028 --> 00:19:51,111
Think you can forgive me?

389
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:55,324
- I already have, will you forgive me?

390
00:19:56,437 --> 00:20:00,020
- You're already back
on Santa's nice list.

391
00:20:10,498 --> 00:20:13,960
- Oh Santa, I think I'm seeing fireworks.

392
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,268
- And it's not even Christmas.

393
00:20:16,268 --> 00:20:19,018
- I can't wait for Christmas Eve.

394
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:50,580
- Ho ho ho.

395
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,186
Looking for this?

396
00:20:52,186 --> 00:20:53,019
- Dad.

397
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:54,629
- Yeah?

398
00:20:54,629 --> 00:20:58,712
- Are Santa and Mrs. Claus still married?

399
00:20:58,712 --> 00:21:00,795
- Yeah, as far as I know.

400
00:21:02,084 --> 00:21:05,001
- No, I mean, are they breaking up?

401
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:06,956
- I don't think so.

402
00:21:06,956 --> 00:21:08,136
Hey, honey.

403
00:21:08,136 --> 00:21:10,406
Hey look, I'm going to make some eggs.

404
00:21:10,406 --> 00:21:12,817
- Oh no time, I've got
to run, big meeting.

405
00:21:12,817 --> 00:21:13,687
- Oh okay.

406
00:21:13,687 --> 00:21:14,761
- Bye, Justin.

407
00:21:14,761 --> 00:21:15,594
- Good luck.

408
00:21:15,594 --> 00:21:16,427
- Thanks!

409
00:21:24,654 --> 00:21:26,407
- Dude, this is awesome!

410
00:21:26,407 --> 00:21:27,552
- What are you talking about?

411
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:30,076
I don't want my mum and
dad getting a divorce.

412
00:21:30,076 --> 00:21:32,488
- Yeah, but if your
new dad is Santa Claus,

413
00:21:32,488 --> 00:21:33,753
think of the toys!

414
00:21:33,753 --> 00:21:35,551
This could be way cool.

415
00:21:35,551 --> 00:21:38,384
- No, it is wrong, I have
to ask them about it.

416
00:21:38,384 --> 00:21:39,252
- That won't work.

417
00:21:39,252 --> 00:21:41,291
My folks didn't tell me anything.

418
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:43,492
They keep that stuff all secret and stuff.

419
00:21:43,492 --> 00:21:46,229
- Yeah, but what about Mrs. Claus?

420
00:21:46,229 --> 00:21:49,642
- Your mum is probably a
lot hotter than Mrs. Claus.

421
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:52,130
- What do you suppose
my mum sees in Santa?

422
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:54,500
My dad is in a lot better shape.

423
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,415
- Hey, mums like presents, too.

424
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:59,220
Besides, Santa has got
magical powers and stuff.

425
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:02,965
- Hey, maybe Santa is using
his magical powers on my mum

426
00:22:02,965 --> 00:22:05,249
to steal her away from my dad.

427
00:22:05,249 --> 00:22:07,423
- I don't know, Santa don't steal.

428
00:22:07,423 --> 00:22:09,006
He doesn't have to.

429
00:22:11,702 --> 00:22:13,212
- Dude, I think I figured it out.

430
00:22:13,212 --> 00:22:14,045
- What?

431
00:22:14,045 --> 00:22:16,513
- Your mum and Santa,
how to keep him away.

432
00:22:16,513 --> 00:22:17,346
- How?

433
00:22:17,346 --> 00:22:19,094
- You've got to be bad.

434
00:22:19,094 --> 00:22:21,055
- What do you mean, bad?

435
00:22:21,055 --> 00:22:22,442
- You know, like the song says,

436
00:22:22,442 --> 00:22:24,815
he's making a list, he checks it twice.

437
00:22:24,815 --> 00:22:27,219
He's gonna find out who naughty or nice.

438
00:22:27,219 --> 00:22:29,094
Santa never comes when a kid's been bad.

439
00:22:29,094 --> 00:22:30,724
You've got to be so bad,

440
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:33,331
that Santa won't ever come to your house.

441
00:22:33,331 --> 00:22:34,924
- That's pretty bad.

442
00:22:34,924 --> 00:22:36,922
- That's how bad you got to be.

443
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:38,714
- I don't know if I could.

444
00:22:38,714 --> 00:22:39,547
Wait.

445
00:22:39,547 --> 00:22:41,360
You're the one who is
always getting in trouble.

446
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,904
You could show me how.

447
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:44,498
- I'm your man.

448
00:22:44,498 --> 00:22:47,597
- Okay, what can I do
that's really, really bad?

449
00:22:47,597 --> 00:22:49,764
- That's easy, fire alarm.

450
00:22:52,044 --> 00:22:53,511
- Pull the fire alarm?

451
00:22:53,511 --> 00:22:54,411
I don't know.

452
00:22:54,411 --> 00:22:56,289
- What's the matter, can't handle it?

453
00:22:56,289 --> 00:22:58,206
- I can, just watch me.

454
00:22:59,801 --> 00:23:00,634
- Look out!

455
00:23:00,634 --> 00:23:01,513
- Cut it out.

456
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:03,846
- You going to do it or not?

457
00:23:07,391 --> 00:23:09,058
Dude, you're so bad!

458
00:23:10,526 --> 00:23:12,987
- You pulled the fire alarm.

459
00:23:12,987 --> 00:23:14,119
- Yeah, so?

460
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:16,287
- You pulled the fire alarm.

461
00:23:16,287 --> 00:23:17,287
I'm telling.

462
00:23:19,556 --> 00:23:20,743
- What happened?

463
00:23:20,743 --> 00:23:22,258
- Try it again.

464
00:23:22,258 --> 00:23:23,562
- It's not working.

465
00:23:23,562 --> 00:23:24,645
- Let me try.

466
00:23:26,659 --> 00:23:28,129
- See, there.

467
00:23:28,129 --> 00:23:29,677
- Bobby Becker!

468
00:23:29,677 --> 00:23:31,094
- I didn't do it!

469
00:23:37,714 --> 00:23:41,350
- Are these your initials carved here?

470
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:43,267
- Yeah, frequent flyer.

471
00:23:45,393 --> 00:23:46,810
- Let's go, boys.

472
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:52,253
- I didn't do it, really!

473
00:23:53,263 --> 00:23:55,715
- Why do I have a hard
time believing that?

474
00:23:55,715 --> 00:23:57,567
- I did it all by myself.

475
00:23:57,567 --> 00:23:59,784
Bobby had nothing to do with it.

476
00:23:59,784 --> 00:24:02,040
- You don't need to cover for him, Justin.

477
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,432
We know Bobby all too well.

478
00:24:04,432 --> 00:24:07,676
- Really, I did it, it was all my fault!

479
00:24:07,676 --> 00:24:09,317
- Okay, Justin.

480
00:24:09,317 --> 00:24:11,254
I admire you for taking the blame.

481
00:24:11,254 --> 00:24:13,716
But you two did a very bad thing.

482
00:24:13,716 --> 00:24:16,595
As you know, the alarm
didn't go off today.

483
00:24:16,595 --> 00:24:19,600
We obviously have a problem in the system.

484
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,765
Had this been a real fire, this
could have been a disaster.

485
00:24:22,765 --> 00:24:25,403
- You mean, I'm not in trouble?

486
00:24:25,403 --> 00:24:27,216
- Let's just say under the circumstances,

487
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:29,807
I'm letting you two off the hook for now.

488
00:24:29,807 --> 00:24:33,551
But only if it never
happens again, understand?

489
00:24:33,551 --> 00:24:35,134
- Can do, Mr. Hoke.

490
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,306
- All right, you can go now.

491
00:24:38,306 --> 00:24:39,995
- You were lucky this time, Robert.

492
00:24:39,995 --> 00:24:42,501
And you're lucky to have
such a friend as Justin.

493
00:24:42,501 --> 00:24:43,334
- But I didn't--

494
00:24:43,334 --> 00:24:44,354
- Don't interrupt me.

495
00:24:44,354 --> 00:24:46,535
Justin, I don't know why
you would take the blame.

496
00:24:46,535 --> 00:24:48,457
You're too good a friend of Bobby,

497
00:24:48,457 --> 00:24:49,407
and he doesn't deserve it.

498
00:24:49,407 --> 00:24:50,270
- But--

499
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:54,270
- Enough, I don't want
to hear anymore about it.

500
00:24:58,052 --> 00:25:02,219
(people chatting)
(horns beeping)

501
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:15,327
- So, how did the meeting go?

502
00:25:15,327 --> 00:25:16,244
- Not good.

503
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,994
- You didn't get the promotion?

504
00:25:18,994 --> 00:25:19,827
- Nope.

505
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:24,752
They gave it to Stan in accounting.

506
00:25:24,752 --> 00:25:25,585
- No!

507
00:25:27,267 --> 00:25:28,437
What?

508
00:25:28,437 --> 00:25:30,417
You're much more qualified than Stan,

509
00:25:30,417 --> 00:25:32,814
and you've been here longer.

510
00:25:32,814 --> 00:25:33,647
- Yeah.

511
00:25:34,537 --> 00:25:37,634
Well I guess, it just wasn't meant to be.

512
00:25:37,634 --> 00:25:39,651
- That's not fair, Stephanie.

513
00:25:39,651 --> 00:25:41,875
What are you going to do?

514
00:25:41,875 --> 00:25:43,125
- I don't know.

515
00:25:44,217 --> 00:25:46,926
We were counting on that raise.

516
00:25:46,926 --> 00:25:49,259
Things are getting so tight.

517
00:25:50,875 --> 00:25:51,880
- I have a friend who says

518
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:55,631
they're looking for someone at Joyco.

519
00:25:55,631 --> 00:25:56,464
- Really?

520
00:25:58,098 --> 00:25:59,547
You think you can get me a meeting?

521
00:25:59,547 --> 00:26:02,130
- Oh, yeah, I'll make the call.

522
00:26:04,827 --> 00:26:07,994
(school bell ringing)

523
00:26:09,803 --> 00:26:12,473
- You're the expert, give
me a little more tips.

524
00:26:12,473 --> 00:26:14,376
How do you get in so much trouble?

525
00:26:14,376 --> 00:26:16,953
- I don't know, it must be
something I was born with.

526
00:26:16,953 --> 00:26:19,870
Most of the time I'm not even trying.

527
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,268
- Fire alarm didn't work.

528
00:26:21,268 --> 00:26:23,575
There's got to be
something rotten I can do.

529
00:26:23,575 --> 00:26:25,807
- Wait, you're the good one, right?

530
00:26:25,807 --> 00:26:29,395
All you do is the opposite
of what you normally do.

531
00:26:29,395 --> 00:26:30,956
- The opposite?

532
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:33,343
- If your mum tells you to take a bath,

533
00:26:33,343 --> 00:26:35,781
you just go roll around
in the mud instead.

534
00:26:35,781 --> 00:26:38,165
- Like if your mum says
to clean up your toys,

535
00:26:38,165 --> 00:26:40,222
you just leave them all over the place.

536
00:26:40,222 --> 00:26:44,175
No, you got to do way
worse stuff than that.

537
00:26:44,175 --> 00:26:45,008
- Man!

538
00:26:45,008 --> 00:26:46,156
- What?

539
00:26:46,156 --> 00:26:49,489
- 345 days of making my bed for nothing.

540
00:26:52,663 --> 00:26:55,585
- Ho, ho, ho, Merry Christmas!

541
00:26:55,585 --> 00:26:56,418
- Merry Christmas, Santa.

542
00:26:56,418 --> 00:26:58,074
- Feliz Noel!

543
00:26:58,074 --> 00:26:58,907
Whatever.

544
00:27:01,476 --> 00:27:03,226
- Look, that's Santa.

545
00:27:06,243 --> 00:27:07,160
Watch this.

546
00:27:08,373 --> 00:27:09,206
- No way!

547
00:27:12,958 --> 00:27:13,791
- Hey!

548
00:27:13,791 --> 00:27:15,678
- You stay away from my mum!

549
00:27:15,678 --> 00:27:19,421
- Listen, kid, you've got me
mistaken for somebody else.

550
00:27:19,421 --> 00:27:22,301
- Don't lie, I saw you with her!

551
00:27:22,301 --> 00:27:23,592
You leave her alone!

552
00:27:23,592 --> 00:27:26,553
- Wait a minute kid, I
don't even know your mother.

553
00:27:26,553 --> 00:27:28,136
- Stay away, fatso!

554
00:27:29,312 --> 00:27:30,145
- Ow!

555
00:27:31,571 --> 00:27:33,071
- Run, Bobby, run!

556
00:27:36,645 --> 00:27:37,562
- Cute kid!

557
00:27:38,951 --> 00:27:40,284
Merry Christmas.

558
00:27:41,794 --> 00:27:43,127
Merry Christmas.

559
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:49,040
- Hey, wait a minute.

560
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,885
Here's a sure-fire way to
get yourself in trouble

561
00:27:51,885 --> 00:27:52,950
at the dinner table.

562
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:54,019
- What's this?

563
00:27:54,019 --> 00:27:55,417
- A fart machine.

564
00:27:55,417 --> 00:27:56,940
You wind it up and sit on it.

565
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:01,922
Then at the right moment, you
lean over and let 'er rip!

566
00:28:01,922 --> 00:28:02,755
- Whoa!

567
00:28:03,611 --> 00:28:05,528
- Good luck, think bad.

568
00:28:08,366 --> 00:28:09,966
- No, no problem at all.

569
00:28:09,966 --> 00:28:11,038
I'll look over the plans tonight,

570
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:12,912
and I'll fax you a bid
first thing in the morning.

571
00:28:12,912 --> 00:28:14,738
Hey, buddy, shoes off.

572
00:28:14,738 --> 00:28:15,655
Snow, snow.

573
00:28:18,836 --> 00:28:21,613
With all due respect,
I hate to guesstimate.

574
00:28:21,613 --> 00:28:23,254
I'm very detailed, I'm very fast.

575
00:28:23,254 --> 00:28:25,181
I'll look them over tonight.

576
00:28:25,181 --> 00:28:26,139
You're going to have the bid

577
00:28:26,139 --> 00:28:28,110
before you get there in the morning.

578
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:28,943
Okay, bye.

579
00:28:31,155 --> 00:28:31,988
Hey, Jus?

580
00:28:31,988 --> 00:28:32,821
What the.

581
00:28:38,946 --> 00:28:42,128
(breaking glass)

582
00:28:42,128 --> 00:28:42,961
Justin!

583
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,793
Come.

584
00:28:47,795 --> 00:28:50,128
Hey, buddy, what's going on?

585
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:57,678
Justin, what's going on here?

586
00:28:57,678 --> 00:28:58,965
(phone ringing)

587
00:28:58,965 --> 00:29:00,882
Don't move, don't move.

588
00:29:01,817 --> 00:29:05,400
I'm going to be right
back, don't you move!

589
00:29:08,672 --> 00:29:12,255
(cheerful Christmas music)

590
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:22,990
♪ Tannenbaum and mangers and mistletoe ♪

591
00:29:23,904 --> 00:29:24,737
- I can't believe it.

592
00:29:24,737 --> 00:29:26,720
Isn't Stan the guy who was
hitting at the CEO's daughter

593
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,307
at the company picnic?

594
00:29:28,307 --> 00:29:30,724
- Yep, they just got engaged.

595
00:29:32,705 --> 00:29:34,788
- Well, that explains it.

596
00:29:36,009 --> 00:29:38,249
- I set up an interview at Joyco.

597
00:29:38,249 --> 00:29:40,162
They're looking for a regional rep.

598
00:29:40,162 --> 00:29:41,464
- That sounds good.

599
00:29:41,464 --> 00:29:42,297
Pay raise?

600
00:29:43,501 --> 00:29:44,684
- Even if I get the job,

601
00:29:44,684 --> 00:29:47,548
I'm still not going to get
a check before Christmas.

602
00:29:47,548 --> 00:29:50,361
- Well, I've got some good news.

603
00:29:50,361 --> 00:29:53,251
I'm going to bid on a job in Ridgecrest.

604
00:29:53,251 --> 00:29:54,084
- Ridgecrest?

605
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:55,293
- Yeah, go figure.

606
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:57,736
And there's a bonus if I get
it done before Christmas.

607
00:29:57,736 --> 00:29:59,367
- Honey, that's great!

608
00:29:59,367 --> 00:30:01,046
We can keep those wolves at bay.

609
00:30:01,046 --> 00:30:03,725
- Don't start congratulating me yet.

610
00:30:03,725 --> 00:30:05,070
I've got to get the job.

611
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:06,403
- You'll get it.

612
00:30:09,302 --> 00:30:10,691
- Meatloaf is done.

613
00:30:10,691 --> 00:30:12,608
Why don't you call your son?

614
00:30:12,608 --> 00:30:15,218
- Whoa, whoa, "my son"?

615
00:30:15,218 --> 00:30:16,468
What did he do?

616
00:30:25,471 --> 00:30:27,221
- [David] Here we go.

617
00:30:29,144 --> 00:30:32,371
- Justin, have you been feeling okay?

618
00:30:32,371 --> 00:30:33,204
- Yeah.

619
00:30:36,049 --> 00:30:39,549
- Your dad tells me you've been acting up.

620
00:30:40,699 --> 00:30:42,695
- Got something on your mind, buddy?

621
00:30:42,695 --> 00:30:44,326
- No.

622
00:30:44,326 --> 00:30:45,312
- Sure is a funny way to act

623
00:30:45,312 --> 00:30:47,963
with Christmas just
around the corner, huh?

624
00:30:47,963 --> 00:30:50,248
- I don't care about Christmas.

625
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:51,081
- What?

626
00:30:51,995 --> 00:30:54,815
Come here, let me feel
you, you must be sick.

627
00:30:54,815 --> 00:30:56,764
(burps)

628
00:30:56,764 --> 00:30:58,097
- Justin Carver!

629
00:30:59,817 --> 00:31:01,279
- What do you say?

630
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:02,112
- Tasty.

631
00:31:03,776 --> 00:31:06,026
- What has gotten into you?

632
00:31:09,199 --> 00:31:12,049
No, no, you eat your vegetables.

633
00:31:12,049 --> 00:31:13,385
- No.

634
00:31:13,385 --> 00:31:14,218
- No?

635
00:31:15,052 --> 00:31:16,482
It's a good thing you
don't care about Christmas,

636
00:31:16,482 --> 00:31:19,299
because at this rate you're
not going to have one.

637
00:31:19,299 --> 00:31:20,808
- Justin.

638
00:31:20,808 --> 00:31:23,093
Did you wash your hands before dinner?

639
00:31:23,093 --> 00:31:24,403
- No.

640
00:31:24,403 --> 00:31:25,257
- Why not?

641
00:31:25,257 --> 00:31:27,456
- I didn't feel like it.

642
00:31:27,456 --> 00:31:30,233
- What do you mean you
didn't feel like it?

643
00:31:30,233 --> 00:31:31,783
(flatulence)

644
00:31:31,783 --> 00:31:32,963
(gasps)

645
00:31:32,963 --> 00:31:34,673
All right, that's it, go to your room.

646
00:31:34,673 --> 00:31:37,160
Go to your room, and don't
come out until I tell you to!

647
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,243
Go on, go on!

648
00:31:43,928 --> 00:31:46,178
- Where did that come from?

649
00:31:47,922 --> 00:31:49,505
- Don't look at me.

650
00:31:54,484 --> 00:31:58,193
- Bobby, it worked, I got sent
to my room without dinner.

651
00:31:58,193 --> 00:32:00,024
- Oh, yeah, cool.

652
00:32:00,024 --> 00:32:02,469
- What's the matter?

653
00:32:02,469 --> 00:32:03,969
- My dad, he left.

654
00:32:06,343 --> 00:32:07,676
- What happened?

655
00:32:09,278 --> 00:32:10,528
- I don't know.

656
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:15,063
They told me he had to
go away on business.

657
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:18,319
- I'm sorry.

658
00:32:20,743 --> 00:32:22,334
- Hey, Justin.

659
00:32:22,334 --> 00:32:23,167
- [Justin] Yeah?

660
00:32:23,167 --> 00:32:25,275
- Do you really think that Santa

661
00:32:25,275 --> 00:32:27,353
can get my parents back together?

662
00:32:27,353 --> 00:32:30,166
- Yeah, you just need to be extra good,

663
00:32:30,166 --> 00:32:32,499
like I have to be extra bad.

664
00:32:37,462 --> 00:32:38,545
- Cut it out!

665
00:32:42,714 --> 00:32:43,547

- You're welcome, Mrs. Carver.

715
00:36:01,123 --> 00:36:02,841
Sorry to bring you in like this.

716
00:36:02,841 --> 00:36:04,759
Thanks for coming by.

717
00:36:04,759 --> 00:36:06,317

718
00:36:06,317 --> 00:36:08,856

- Yes, everything's fine.

721
00:36:14,299 --> 00:36:17,178
I mean, nothing out of the ordinary.

722
00:36:17,178 --> 00:36:19,793
- Yeah well, I'm sure
this will be the last time

723
00:36:19,793 --> 00:36:23,595
he'll cause any problems,
isn't that right, Justin?

724
00:36:23,595 --> 00:36:25,512
- We'll see, tough guy.

725
00:36:27,981 --> 00:36:29,814
- Justin Henry Carver!

726
00:36:32,775 --> 00:36:34,692
Thanks again, Mr. Hoke.

727
00:36:35,857 --> 00:36:38,190
Come over here and sit down.

728
00:36:40,732 --> 00:36:44,209
What in the world has gotten into you?

729
00:36:44,209 --> 00:36:48,290
Justin, your father and I
are very concerned about you.

730
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:50,087
- Well, get over it.

731
00:36:50,087 --> 00:36:52,941
- All right, what is the matter?

732
00:36:52,941 --> 00:36:53,774
- Nothing.

733
00:36:56,582 --> 00:36:58,415
- This isn't like you.

734
00:37:00,849 --> 00:37:03,599
Is there something bothering you?

735
00:37:04,662 --> 00:37:09,047
Justin, you know if there
is something on your mind,

736
00:37:09,047 --> 00:37:10,557
you can talk to me.

737
00:37:10,557 --> 00:37:12,640
You know that, don't you?

738
00:37:14,487 --> 00:37:19,267
Well, is there something
you want to talk about?

739
00:37:19,267 --> 00:37:20,100
- No.

740
00:37:23,125 --> 00:37:24,292
- You're sure?

741
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:30,803
I can count on you behaving from now on?

742
00:37:32,904 --> 00:37:34,457
Justin?

743
00:37:34,457 --> 00:37:35,290
- Okay.

744
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:38,373
(cell phone ringing)

745
00:37:41,753 --> 00:37:43,263
- Hello?

746
00:37:43,263 --> 00:37:44,346
- Ho, ho, ho!

747
00:37:46,166 --> 00:37:47,749
- Oh, hello, Santa.

748
00:37:50,013 --> 00:37:51,446
- Hey, how did it go at school?

749
00:37:51,446 --> 00:37:54,182
- I don't think we have
to worry about Justin.

750
00:37:54,182 --> 00:37:58,115
I think he is going to be a very good boy.

751
00:37:58,115 --> 00:37:59,302
- Ah, great.

752
00:37:59,302 --> 00:38:02,952
Steph, I got some good
news, I got the job!

753
00:38:02,952 --> 00:38:05,048
Looks like we're going to
have a Christmas after all.

754
00:38:05,048 --> 00:38:07,715
- Oh honey, that's great, Santa.

755
00:38:09,117 --> 00:38:10,200
- I want to stop on the way home.

756
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,268
I want to pick up that
commando toy for Justin.

757
00:38:12,268 --> 00:38:13,867
It can't be that much, can it?

758
00:38:13,867 --> 00:38:16,408
What was it called again,
where can I find it?

759
00:38:16,408 --> 00:38:18,944
- Ah, hold on one minute.

760
00:38:18,944 --> 00:38:21,397
Justin, could you please
wait for mommy outside?

761
00:38:21,397 --> 00:38:22,986
- I want to talk to Santa.

762
00:38:22,986 --> 00:38:26,301
You will get your chance
at the mall, I promise.

763
00:38:26,301 --> 00:38:28,339
- No, I want to talk to him now!

764
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:29,756
- Justin, please!

765
00:38:36,922 --> 00:38:37,943
Okay.

766
00:38:37,943 --> 00:38:41,860
It's the Stellarian space
commando set or suit.

767
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:47,770
I know he wants the suit, the silver suit.

780
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,552

781
00:39:29,552 --> 00:39:32,072

783
00:39:33,669 --> 00:39:35,571

784
00:39:35,571 --> 00:39:37,738
- Got to go, over and out.

785
00:39:42,152 --> 00:39:45,872
- Hey commando, it is time for lights-out.

786
00:39:45,872 --> 00:39:47,072
- [Justin] Where's dad?

787
00:39:47,072 --> 00:39:48,822
- He'll be home soon.

788
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:51,334
- Can I wait up for him?

789
00:39:51,334 --> 00:39:54,234
- No, no, no, he could be very late.

790
00:39:54,234 --> 00:39:56,242
- Well, where is he?

791
00:39:56,242 --> 00:39:58,220
- He has a job out of town.

792
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:00,041
It's a long ride home.

793
00:40:00,041 --> 00:40:01,527
Now, you go to sleep.

794
00:40:01,527 --> 00:40:05,208
You will see your daddy in the morning.

795
00:40:05,208 --> 00:40:06,408
- 'Night.

796
00:40:06,408 --> 00:40:07,241
- 'Night.

00:40:18,133 --> 00:40:22,300

- Oh, David, thank you.

800
00:40:36,463 --> 00:40:39,046
- Read the card, read the card!

801
00:40:42,916 --> 00:40:45,308
- "Here's to the merriest Christmas ever.

802
00:40:45,308 --> 00:40:47,086
"Love, Santa."

803
00:40:47,086 --> 00:40:49,503
Oh, honey, they're beautiful!

804
00:40:52,212 --> 00:40:53,368
- Hey, you know.

805
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:55,519
I looked everywhere for
Justin's commando toy.

806
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:56,830
I can't find it, they're sold out.

807
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:58,235
- Oh don't worry, I'll look for it.

808
00:40:58,235 --> 00:40:59,870
Tell me, tell me about the job.

809
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:00,870
- All right.

810
00:41:02,764 --> 00:41:05,365
All right, all right,
here's the good news.

811
00:41:05,365 --> 00:41:06,731
They want the job done by Christmas eve,

812
00:41:06,731 --> 00:41:08,285
so I gotta start tomorrow.

813
00:41:08,285 --> 00:41:09,305
- So soon?

814
00:41:09,305 --> 00:41:10,494
- I got to get up at four in the morning

815
00:41:10,494 --> 00:41:13,885
just to get there in time, but look.

816
00:41:13,885 --> 00:41:14,718
Da-da-da.

817
00:41:14,718 --> 00:41:16,312
(gasps)

818
00:41:16,312 --> 00:41:18,264
- Look at this.

819
00:41:18,264 --> 00:41:20,711
We can pay the mortgage,
insurance, some credit cards.

820
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:22,448
- Maybe even have a real Christmas.

821
00:41:22,448 --> 00:41:24,391
- Oh, honey, this is so great.

822
00:41:24,391 --> 00:41:25,922
- Now there is a little bit of bad news.

823
00:41:25,922 --> 00:41:27,134
- Do I want to hear this?

824
00:41:27,134 --> 00:41:28,342
- It's not that bad.

825
00:41:28,342 --> 00:41:30,120
Just because of the deadline,

826
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,563
I think it's going to be
better if I stay up there.

827
00:41:32,563 --> 00:41:34,218
You don't know how bad
the snow was tonight.

828
00:41:34,218 --> 00:41:35,418
Took me three hours to get back here.

829
00:41:35,418 --> 00:41:37,485
It's going to take me all
day tomorrow to get up there

830
00:41:37,485 --> 00:41:39,865
if the pass is closed.

831
00:41:39,865 --> 00:41:41,559
But don't worry.

832
00:41:41,559 --> 00:41:44,041
I will be home in time for Christmas,

833
00:41:44,041 --> 00:41:46,225
and I'll be a very real Santa.

834
00:41:46,225 --> 00:41:48,542
- I'm just worried about Justin.

835
00:41:48,542 --> 00:41:49,500
- He'll be fine, is he asleep?

836
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,816
- [Stephanie] Oh yeah.

837
00:41:50,816 --> 00:41:52,607
- Of course he is, I didn't
realize how late it was.

838
00:41:52,607 --> 00:41:54,857
I got to get to bed myself.

839
00:41:57,005 --> 00:41:59,154
You know, I was thinking.

840
00:41:59,154 --> 00:42:00,106
Justin is getting older,

841
00:42:00,106 --> 00:42:01,262
and this could be the last Christmas

842
00:42:01,262 --> 00:42:03,947
he actually believes in Santa Claus.

843
00:42:03,947 --> 00:42:05,270
We got the old suit,

844
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:07,179
so maybe we should really do it up right.

845
00:42:07,179 --> 00:42:09,410
You know, do something special for him.

846
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:11,077
- That sounds great.

847
00:42:13,109 --> 00:42:15,609
Come on, let's get you to bed.

848
00:42:21,392 --> 00:42:23,250
Your breakfast is ready.

849
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:25,180
- Where's dad?

850
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:27,915
- Your father had to leave
early this morning for work.

851
00:42:27,915 --> 00:42:28,748
- What?

852
00:42:30,267 --> 00:42:32,791
- Justin, daddy's going
to be working out of town

853
00:42:32,791 --> 00:42:33,791
for a while.

854
00:42:34,903 --> 00:42:36,597
- For how long?

855
00:42:36,597 --> 00:42:38,542
- Well, he'll be back for Christmas,

856
00:42:38,542 --> 00:42:42,096
and then we are going
to have a great time.

857
00:42:42,096 --> 00:42:43,464
Now, grandpa will be here

858
00:42:43,464 --> 00:42:45,323
when you get back from school, okay?

859
00:42:45,323 --> 00:42:46,156
- Okay.

860
00:42:47,561 --> 00:42:50,811
- You finish up, I've got to get going.

861
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:04,013
- [Justin] She told me he
would be working out of town

862
00:43:04,013 --> 00:43:05,712
for a little while.

863
00:43:05,712 --> 00:43:08,879
- Yeah, that's what they told me, too.

864
00:43:11,553 --> 00:43:12,960
(clears throat)

865
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,938
- Good morning, Ms. Crumley.

866
00:43:14,938 --> 00:43:17,543
- Good morning, Robert.

867
00:43:17,543 --> 00:43:20,710
Now, class, I want you all to remember

868
00:43:21,793 --> 00:43:25,721
that tomorrow is our last
day before winter break

869
00:43:25,721 --> 00:43:28,399
and our class holiday party.

870
00:43:28,399 --> 00:43:30,676
(class cheering)

871
00:43:30,676 --> 00:43:32,901
All right, calm down.

872
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:37,068
And don't forget to bring a
wrapped gift for the grab bag.

873
00:43:38,059 --> 00:43:41,059
Now, open your workbooks to page 53.

874
00:43:41,967 --> 00:43:43,412
Who wants to start?

875
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:44,579
- Ooh, me, me!

876
00:43:45,506 --> 00:43:47,173
Ooh, me, please, me!

877
00:43:53,746 --> 00:43:55,529
- Yeah, sure, highway 89.

878
00:43:55,529 --> 00:43:56,779
I got it, yeah.

879
00:43:58,889 --> 00:44:00,708
Okay, who's next?

880
00:44:00,708 --> 00:44:01,708
- That's me.

881
00:44:04,417 --> 00:44:05,366
- Congratulations, Floyd.

882
00:44:05,366 --> 00:44:08,667
You hit the big time,
the Mountainview mall.

883
00:44:08,667 --> 00:44:10,238

00:44:57,982 --> 00:45:00,599
- Whoa, slow down a
minute, buddy, how are you?

901
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:02,657
- I'm fine, but you got to come home.

902
00:45:02,657 --> 00:45:03,882
- Daddy's working, Justin.

903
00:45:03,882 --> 00:45:06,175
Didn't mommy tell you, I'll
be home in time for Christmas.

904
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:07,561
- But dad.

905
00:45:07,561 --> 00:45:09,969
- Look, Jus, I'm sorry I didn't
get a chance to say goodbye

906
00:45:09,969 --> 00:45:11,812
but I had to leave pretty early.

907
00:45:11,812 --> 00:45:13,207
- But, dad, listen.

908
00:45:13,207 --> 00:45:14,432
- I want you to do me a favor,

909
00:45:14,432 --> 00:45:16,239
I want you to make me a promise.

910
00:45:16,239 --> 00:45:17,345
- What?

911
00:45:17,345 --> 00:45:19,426
- I want you to be the man
of the house while I'm gone.

912
00:45:19,426 --> 00:45:21,507
I want you to take care of your mum.

913
00:45:21,507 --> 00:45:23,512
- No, dad, you got to come home!

914
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:24,820
- Justin, you got to promise me.

915
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:26,209
I want you to be good to your mother,

916
00:45:26,209 --> 00:45:28,700
and no more of this monkey
business, all right?

917
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:30,052
- [Man] Dave, we need your signature.

918
00:45:30,052 --> 00:45:31,851
- Justin I want you to promise.

919
00:45:31,851 --> 00:45:32,934
Are you there?

920
00:45:32,934 --> 00:45:33,767
- [Justin] Yeah, but, dad.

921
00:45:33,767 --> 00:45:35,116
- Alright, look buddy, I got to go.

922
00:45:35,116 --> 00:45:37,692
I'll talk to you later,
and I love you, okay?

923
00:45:37,692 --> 00:45:38,609
- Dad, dad!

924
00:45:39,532 --> 00:45:40,615
- I got to go.

925
00:45:40,615 --> 00:45:41,448
Bye bye.

926
00:45:45,046 --> 00:45:46,379
- You okay, huh?

927
00:45:47,456 --> 00:45:49,956
Hey, don't I get a hello, huh?

928
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,338
Okay, I know what will cheer you up.

929
00:45:53,338 --> 00:45:54,171

941
00:46:36,338 --> 00:46:38,913
All the time, smiling at all costs.

942
00:46:38,913 --> 00:46:41,958
Here's why, because Santa is jolly.

943
00:46:41,958 --> 00:46:43,236
Think jolly thoughts.

944
00:46:43,236 --> 00:46:46,017
Jolly, jolly, jolly, can you do that?

945
00:46:46,017 --> 00:46:47,211
But if I catch you drinking,

946
00:46:47,211 --> 00:46:49,274
or fraternizing with any of the elfettes,

947
00:46:49,274 --> 00:46:51,168
you're out of here.

948
00:46:51,168 --> 00:46:54,504
Now some of the children,
how should I put this?

949
00:46:54,504 --> 00:46:56,667
You're gonna have to have a little.

950
00:46:56,667 --> 00:46:58,774
You're gonna have to have a little

951
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:00,750
patience, okay, can you do that?

952
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:01,906
- Believe me, sir.

953
00:47:01,906 --> 00:47:04,420
I'm going to be the
best Santa you ever had.

954
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:06,910
The last thing I want is
to be out in the cold.

955
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:07,927
- Okay, good, fine.

956
00:47:07,927 --> 00:47:09,581
Okay, you're on.

957
00:47:09,581 --> 00:47:10,414
Hey Santa.

958
00:47:12,725 --> 00:47:13,821
Think jolly.

959
00:47:13,821 --> 00:47:14,904
- Ho, ho, ho!

960
00:47:35,208 --> 00:47:37,794
- Whoa, grandpa, Major Titanium!

961
00:47:37,794 --> 00:47:40,067
- I thought you'd like that.

962
00:47:40,067 --> 00:47:43,913
But it looks like we're
still a little early.

963
00:47:43,913 --> 00:47:47,826
In the meantime, what do
you say we go see Santa?

964
00:47:47,826 --> 00:47:50,076
- Yeah, let's go see Santa.

965
00:47:53,148 --> 00:47:57,774
- Ladies and gentlemen,
Santa's village is now open.

966
00:47:57,774 --> 00:48:00,211
Santa is in the building!

967
00:48:00,211 --> 00:48:02,648
Santa is in the building!

968
00:48:02,648 --> 00:48:05,148
- Merry Christmas, ho, ho, ho!

969
00:48:08,882 --> 00:48:10,240
Ho, ho, ho!

970
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,573
Merry Christmas!

971
00:48:16,970 --> 00:48:19,804
- How is it looking up in the crow's nest?

972
00:48:19,804 --> 00:48:20,804
- All clear.

973
00:48:22,277 --> 00:48:23,110
- Copy that.

974
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:25,677
Bring me some more
balloons, I'm running low.

975
00:48:25,677 --> 00:48:27,659
- Roger, elf one.

976
00:48:27,659 --> 00:48:30,834
- Merry Christmas, ho, ho, ho!

977
00:48:30,834 --> 00:48:32,651
What's your name, little girl?

978
00:48:32,651 --> 00:48:35,662
(girl crying)

979
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:37,177
- Do you know what you're
going to tell Santa?

980
00:48:37,177 --> 00:48:39,982
- Yeah, I have a pretty good idea.

981
00:48:39,982 --> 00:48:41,218
- Well, look, sport.

982
00:48:41,218 --> 00:48:43,749
I have to get your mum a present.

983
00:48:43,749 --> 00:48:45,999
I'll be right up there in that store.

984
00:48:45,999 --> 00:48:47,528
When you're finished with Santa,

985
00:48:47,528 --> 00:48:49,842
I'll meet you on the bridge, okay?

986
00:48:49,842 --> 00:48:51,405
- Okay.

987
00:48:51,405 --> 00:48:53,178
- Can you keep an eye on the little guy?

988
00:48:53,178 --> 00:48:55,441
I'll be right back.

989
00:48:55,441 --> 00:48:56,274
- Copy that.

990
00:48:56,274 --> 00:48:57,107
- Thanks.

991
00:48:59,856 --> 00:49:01,237
(girl whining)

992
00:49:01,237 --> 00:49:03,263
- What would you like Santa
to bring you for Christmas,

993
00:49:03,263 --> 00:49:04,263
little girl?

994
00:49:05,593 --> 00:49:08,432
You know what you want for Christmas?

995
00:49:08,432 --> 00:49:09,849
Okay, ho, ho, ho.

996
00:49:19,245 --> 00:49:20,158
- That's a lemon meringue.

997
00:49:20,158 --> 00:49:21,908
- Oh, lemon meringue.

998
00:49:23,848 --> 00:49:24,831
How much is it?

999
00:49:24,831 --> 00:49:26,081
- [Woman] 5,50.

1000
00:49:27,148 --> 00:49:30,065
- Merry Christmas, merry Christmas!

1001
00:49:31,028 --> 00:49:33,120
Merry, how am I doing?

1002
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:35,453
Merry Christmas, ho, ho, ho!

1003
00:49:38,233 --> 00:49:39,309
- Attention shoppers!

1004
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:41,083
Attention all shoppers!

1005
00:49:41,083 --> 00:49:44,689
Santa is a dirty rat, he's
cheating on Mrs. Claus!

1006
00:49:44,689 --> 00:49:45,885
- It's that kid!

1007
00:49:45,885 --> 00:49:47,288
- Boycott Santa!

1008
00:49:47,288 --> 00:49:49,477
Don't leave him any milk and cookies!

1009
00:49:49,477 --> 00:49:51,060
He's a homewrecker!

1010
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:53,457
- I'm not really.

1011
00:49:54,668 --> 00:49:55,501
- Can I have that?

1012
00:49:55,501 --> 00:49:56,334
Thanks.

1013
00:49:57,558 --> 00:49:58,906
- Kid, come over here.

1014
00:49:58,906 --> 00:49:59,739
I don't--

1015
00:50:00,734 --> 00:50:03,151
(rock music)

1016
00:50:37,077 --> 00:50:38,910
Come here, little boy!

1017
00:50:39,843 --> 00:50:42,093
Pardon me, merry Christmas.

1018
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:04,073
Down here!

1019
00:51:11,197 --> 00:51:13,441
- Whoa, it's you!

1020
00:51:13,441 --> 00:51:15,012
- Hey, kid.

1021
00:51:15,012 --> 00:51:16,702
- At your command, sir.

1022
00:51:16,702 --> 00:51:19,008
- Merry Christmas, kid.

1023
00:51:19,008 --> 00:51:20,008
Er, at ease.

1024
00:51:21,773 --> 00:51:22,847
Look, kid, I got to go.

1025
00:51:22,847 --> 00:51:24,255
I'm late, see you.

1026
00:51:24,255 --> 00:51:25,497
- Wait, major, sir!

1027
00:51:25,497 --> 00:51:27,987
You're a superhero, I need some help.

1028
00:51:27,987 --> 00:51:31,337
You see, I have a situation at home

1029
00:51:31,337 --> 00:51:35,176
and I just don't want to name
names 'cause that's telling

1030
00:51:35,176 --> 00:51:36,494
but let's just say--

1031
00:51:36,494 --> 00:51:37,960
Wait, major, sir!

1032
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:40,274
My point is, I'm in a fix.

1033
00:51:40,274 --> 00:51:41,882
Remember the time you were being attacked

1034
00:51:41,882 --> 00:51:44,513
by the giant mutant death drone?

1035
00:51:44,513 --> 00:51:47,818
Well, I need to know how you
patched the plasma cannon

1036
00:51:47,818 --> 00:51:51,485
to the force field and
defended the station.

1037
00:51:54,671 --> 00:51:56,342
- Look, I'm really sorry
to disappoint you, kid,

1038
00:51:56,342 --> 00:51:59,342
but I'm not the real Major Titanium.

1039
00:52:02,567 --> 00:52:05,253
I'm one of his soldiers, commandos.

1040
00:52:05,253 --> 00:52:06,986
There's hundreds of us defending malls

1041
00:52:06,986 --> 00:52:09,333
and toy stores all over the US.

1042
00:52:09,333 --> 00:52:13,416
- If you're not the real
major, then where is he?

1043
00:52:16,558 --> 00:52:18,502
- Where he belongs, son.

1044
00:52:18,502 --> 00:52:20,160
Up there.

1045
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,077
Defending the universe.

1046
00:52:24,331 --> 00:52:27,185
Hey, you'll be all right, kid.

1047
00:52:27,185 --> 00:52:29,471
Hang in there, stay tough.

1048
00:52:29,471 --> 00:52:33,638
- But major, sir, or whoever
you are, what should I do?

1049
00:52:36,274 --> 00:52:38,941
- Just remember, finish the job!

1050
00:52:52,358 --> 00:52:53,191
- Got to go!

1051
00:52:53,191 --> 00:52:54,399
- There he is.

1052
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:56,066
Come on, we got him!

1053
00:53:48,314 --> 00:53:49,231
- Look out!

1054
00:54:13,911 --> 00:54:15,161
Stay here, kid.

1055
00:54:19,154 --> 00:54:20,475
- There you are.

1056
00:54:20,475 --> 00:54:23,225
Did you tell Santa what you want?

1057
00:54:25,035 --> 00:54:26,726
- I think he got the message.

1058
00:54:26,726 --> 00:54:30,476
- Well, then should we
go see Major Titanium?

1059
00:54:31,401 --> 00:54:35,389
- You know, grandpa, it's
not really Major Titanium.

1060
00:54:35,389 --> 00:54:37,374
It's just one of his commandos.

1061
00:54:37,374 --> 00:54:38,575
We can go home.

1062
00:54:38,575 --> 00:54:40,492
- [Grandpa] Okay, then.

1063
00:54:47,135 --> 00:54:48,968
- Santa, are you okay?

1064
00:54:51,464 --> 00:54:54,486
- Yeah, thanks, I think so.

1065
00:54:54,486 --> 00:54:57,287
- Good, because you're fired!

1066
00:54:57,287 --> 00:54:58,120
Get out of here!

1067
00:54:58,120 --> 00:54:59,120
Go, be gone!

1068
00:55:00,842 --> 00:55:02,092
Go, go, go, go!

1069
00:55:05,096 --> 00:55:08,763
It's so hard to get a
good Santa these days.

1070
00:55:14,444 --> 00:55:17,580
- Yes, that sounds great, thank you.

1071
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:18,413
Okay.

1072
00:55:19,305 --> 00:55:21,365
And merry Christmas to you, too.

1073
00:55:21,365 --> 00:55:22,198
Bye.

1074
00:55:23,783 --> 00:55:24,616
- Well?

1075
00:55:26,557 --> 00:55:28,130
- They made me an offer.

1076
00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:29,713
- Oh, you go, girl!

1077
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,894
- I don't know, though, a toy company?

1078
00:55:33,894 --> 00:55:36,907
- Oh, you'll be great,
what does David think?

1079
00:55:36,907 --> 00:55:38,065
- He thinks it's great.

1080
00:55:38,065 --> 00:55:38,927
It's a raise.

1081
00:55:38,927 --> 00:55:41,030
- Well, there you go.

1082
00:55:41,030 --> 00:55:44,210
- And they said I can
hire my own assistant.

1083
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:45,202
You wouldn't happen to know anybody

1084
00:55:45,202 --> 00:55:47,952
that would be interested, do you?

1085
00:55:49,003 --> 00:55:50,503
- Are you kidding?

1086
00:55:52,014 --> 00:55:53,431
When do we start?

1087
00:56:16,245 --> 00:56:18,662
- So, how was the mall today?

1088
00:56:21,958 --> 00:56:22,791
- Crowded.

1089
00:56:24,348 --> 00:56:25,462
- Did you see Santa?

1090
00:56:25,462 --> 00:56:26,295
- Yeah.

1091
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:32,141
- Well, I've got some good news.

1092
00:56:32,141 --> 00:56:33,308
- What's that?

1093
00:56:35,404 --> 00:56:37,711
- I have a new job.

1094
00:56:37,711 --> 00:56:39,569
With a raise.

1095
00:56:39,569 --> 00:56:42,287
- That's my girl, where?

1096
00:56:42,287 --> 00:56:44,237
- Joyco toy company.

1097
00:56:44,237 --> 00:56:45,903
- A toy company?

1098
00:56:45,903 --> 00:56:48,621
- That's right, creating toys.

1099
00:56:48,621 --> 00:56:50,061
I think we're going to
be doing a lot of work

1100
00:56:50,061 --> 00:56:51,394
for Santa Claus.

1101
00:56:54,065 --> 00:56:58,232
- Working with Santa, what
do you think of that, sport?

1102
00:57:03,312 --> 00:57:05,206
What's that all about?

1103
00:57:05,206 --> 00:57:06,456
- I don't know.

1104
00:57:07,802 --> 00:57:11,483
I don't know what has
gotten into him lately.

1105
00:57:11,483 --> 00:57:13,178
Did he behave today at the mall?

1106
00:57:13,178 --> 00:57:14,011
- Sure.

1107
00:57:15,488 --> 00:57:18,832
- Nothing, nothing out of the ordinary?

1108
00:57:18,832 --> 00:57:20,570
- Now that you mention it,

1109
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:22,763
he first seemed excited to meet that

1110
00:57:22,763 --> 00:57:25,770
captain, colonel, Titan fella.

1111
00:57:25,770 --> 00:57:28,020
But then, he lost interest.

1112
00:57:29,718 --> 00:57:30,551
- Do you think maybe

1113
00:57:30,551 --> 00:57:32,703
he doesn't believe in Santa Claus anymore?

1114
00:57:32,703 --> 00:57:34,810
- Well, he saw Santa.

1115
00:57:34,810 --> 00:57:37,643
He didn't say anything about that.

1116
00:57:39,554 --> 00:57:41,554
- I wonder if that's it.

1117
00:57:44,629 --> 00:57:47,851
Any luck getting that
commando toy he wants so much?

1118
00:57:47,851 --> 00:57:49,215
- Sold out.

1119
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:51,882
The salesman just laughed at me.

1120
00:57:56,729 --> 00:57:59,479
(cheerful music)

1121
00:58:04,199 --> 00:58:08,867
- I'm telling you, it's
this kid, he's stalking me.

1122
00:58:08,867 --> 00:58:11,256
- Look, you're a Santa Claus.

1123
00:58:11,256 --> 00:58:14,187
You have to deal with kids,
it's in your job description.

1124
00:58:14,187 --> 00:58:16,617
If you can't handle that,
I'll find somebody who can.

1125
00:58:16,617 --> 00:58:20,131
- I can handle it, I can handle kids.

1126
00:58:20,131 --> 00:58:23,881
It's just this one kid,
he's a public menace.

1127
00:58:28,311 --> 00:58:29,340
Please, Sidney.

1128
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:31,498
Sidney, give me one more chance, Sid.

1129
00:58:31,498 --> 00:58:33,748
I won't blow it, I promise.

1130
00:58:44,111 --> 00:58:45,725
- Ready?

1131
00:58:45,725 --> 00:58:50,080
Last day of school before
winter break, you excited?

1132
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:54,823
This is the grab bag gift
for the Christmas party.

1133
00:58:54,823 --> 00:58:56,310
Why don't you wait for me to get my purse?

1134
00:58:56,310 --> 00:58:57,752
We can leave together.

1135
00:58:57,752 --> 00:58:59,419
Where's your jacket?

1136
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:16,357
- One at a time, children, one at a time.

1137
00:59:18,018 --> 00:59:20,532
- Your mum working with Santa?

1138
00:59:20,532 --> 00:59:23,871
Dude, you are going to be so connected.

1139
00:59:23,871 --> 00:59:25,146
- I don't want to be connected.

1140
00:59:25,146 --> 00:59:27,414
Maybe being bad isn't good enough.

1141
00:59:27,414 --> 00:59:28,976
- Your mum and dad have been good.

1142
00:59:28,976 --> 00:59:31,279
So Santa's going to come no matter what.

1143
00:59:31,279 --> 00:59:33,712
Being bad just means
you won't get anything,

1144
00:59:33,712 --> 00:59:35,987
except for maybe coal in your stocking.

1145
00:59:35,987 --> 00:59:37,636
- I need to keep him away from my house

1146
00:59:37,636 --> 00:59:39,821
until my dad gets back.

1147
00:59:39,821 --> 00:59:42,174
There has to be a way I can keep him

1148
00:59:42,174 --> 00:59:43,905
from landing on my roof.

1149
00:59:43,905 --> 00:59:45,516
- Santa doesn't land on the roof,

1150
00:59:45,516 --> 00:59:47,041
he lands on the front yard.

1151
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:48,355
- How do you know?

1152
00:59:48,355 --> 00:59:51,289
- My dad told me, our
roofs are too slanted.

1153
00:59:51,289 --> 00:59:55,456
His sleigh would tip over
if he parked it up there.

1154
01:00:01,296 --> 01:00:02,879
- Who brought this?

1155
01:00:06,809 --> 01:00:08,873
- [Santa] Ho, ho, ho!

1156
01:00:08,873 --> 01:00:10,060
- Now who could that be?

1157
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:11,118
- Ho, ho, ho!

1158
01:00:11,118 --> 01:00:12,618
- Why, it's Santa.

1159
01:00:13,763 --> 01:00:15,454
- Merry Christmas!

1160
01:00:15,454 --> 01:00:16,787
Merry Christmas!

1161
01:00:27,085 --> 01:00:27,918
- Justin!

1162
01:00:33,454 --> 01:00:35,676
- Yeah, just a minute.

1163
01:00:35,676 --> 01:00:37,093
Steph, Stephanie.

1164
01:00:39,229 --> 01:00:41,235
It's Justin's principal.

1165
01:00:41,235 --> 01:00:42,902
- Oh, no, not again.

1166
01:00:45,356 --> 01:00:46,189
Mr. Hoke?

1167
01:00:47,712 --> 01:00:50,268
What is it this time?

1168
01:00:50,268 --> 01:00:52,990
Grandpa is going to come pick you up.

1169
01:00:52,990 --> 01:00:54,525
- Is everything okay?

1170
01:00:54,525 --> 01:00:56,910
- Please take him directly home.

1171
01:00:56,910 --> 01:01:00,749
And be informed that he is
grounded until further notice.

1172
01:01:00,749 --> 01:01:01,945
- That's serious.

1173
01:01:01,945 --> 01:01:03,722
- Yes, it is serious.

1174
01:01:03,722 --> 01:01:06,972
Assaulting Santa is no laughing matter.

1175
01:01:07,844 --> 01:01:09,177
- Of course not.

1176
01:01:10,196 --> 01:01:12,546
- I will see you later.

1177
01:01:12,546 --> 01:01:13,774
Thanks, dad.

1178
01:01:13,774 --> 01:01:16,581
- Come on, Justin, your
mum has to get to work.

1179
01:01:16,581 --> 01:01:18,106
- Irwin?

1180
01:01:18,106 --> 01:01:19,723
Irwin Matthews?

1181
01:01:19,723 --> 01:01:20,837
- Yes?

1182
01:01:20,837 --> 01:01:25,004
- Hi, it's me, Betty
Crumley, from Griffith High.

1183
01:01:25,004 --> 01:01:26,942
Donna's little sister.

1184
01:01:26,942 --> 01:01:29,581
- Betty Crumley, is that really you?

1185
01:01:29,581 --> 01:01:31,648
You haven't changed a lick.

1186
01:01:31,648 --> 01:01:33,231
- Neither have you.

1187
01:01:36,519 --> 01:01:37,427
- [Announcer] Good for bicycle riding,

1188
01:01:37,427 --> 01:01:38,416
or defending the galaxy.

1189
01:01:38,416 --> 01:01:39,739
Armor and weaponry sold separately.

1190
01:01:39,739 --> 01:01:40,601
Batteries not included.

1191
01:01:40,601 --> 01:01:43,934
And remember, commandos, finish the job!

1192
01:01:48,193 --> 01:01:49,403
- Hey, partner.

1193
01:01:49,403 --> 01:01:52,486
- [Host] Welcome back to what's new--

1194
01:01:58,293 --> 01:02:01,472
- You know, you got your
mum and dad all worried.

1195
01:02:01,472 --> 01:02:03,823
You got something on your
mind you want to share?

1196
01:02:03,823 --> 01:02:07,005
Sometimes, it feels better
to get things off your chest.

1197
01:02:07,005 --> 01:02:09,526
- It's Santa, him and mum.

1198
01:02:09,526 --> 01:02:11,712
He's trying to steal her away from dad!

1199
01:02:11,712 --> 01:02:12,663
- What?

1200
01:02:12,663 --> 01:02:13,819
- I saw them together.

1201
01:02:13,819 --> 01:02:17,154
Getting all mushy, I have
a picture and everything.

1202
01:02:17,154 --> 01:02:17,987
- A picture?

1203
01:02:17,987 --> 01:02:19,257
Let's see it.

1204
01:02:19,257 --> 01:02:20,969
- I sent it to Mrs. Claus.

1205
01:02:20,969 --> 01:02:24,020
- I think Santa was just being friendly.

1206
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:27,324
- She's been getting phone
calls, and flowers and stuff.

1207
01:02:27,324 --> 01:02:29,927
He even got her a new job.

1208
01:02:29,927 --> 01:02:31,786
- Listen, Justin.

1209
01:02:31,786 --> 01:02:35,058
I wouldn't worry about it if I were you.

1210
01:02:35,058 --> 01:02:37,467
Santa is a stand-up guy.

1211
01:02:37,467 --> 01:02:39,577
He wouldn't do anything bad.

1212
01:02:39,577 --> 01:02:41,849
You'll see when he comes at Christmas.

1213
01:02:41,849 --> 01:02:44,942
Everything is going to be just fine.

1214
01:02:44,942 --> 01:02:46,634
- No, you have to believe me.

1215
01:02:46,634 --> 01:02:49,896
- I do believe you but I know Santa.

1216
01:02:49,896 --> 01:02:51,876
And he's okay.

1217
01:02:51,876 --> 01:02:55,793
You're going to have to
trust me on this, okay?

1218
01:02:58,127 --> 01:02:59,544
I can't hear you.

1219
01:03:00,971 --> 01:03:01,804
- Okay.

1220
01:03:07,613 --> 01:03:10,958
- Oh, David, tomorrow is Christmas eve!

1221
01:03:10,958 --> 01:03:12,417
- Don't worry, honey, I'll
home with plenty of time.

1222
01:03:12,417 --> 01:03:13,793
We're going to work through the night.

1223
01:03:13,793 --> 01:03:16,329
I should be on the road
by mid-afternoon tomorrow.

1224
01:03:16,329 --> 01:03:19,175
- I was hoping you'd make it home tonight.

1225
01:03:19,175 --> 01:03:20,618
Justin got in trouble again today.

1226
01:03:20,618 --> 01:03:22,229
I think he misses you.

1227
01:03:22,229 --> 01:03:23,062
- I miss him, too.

1228
01:03:23,062 --> 01:03:25,396
Hey, did you find that present?

1229
01:03:25,396 --> 01:03:28,063
- No, it is sold out everywhere!

1230
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:31,211
- I'll check at Ridgecrest
on my way home then.

1231
01:03:31,211 --> 01:03:33,441
- No, no, honey, you just get home.

1232
01:03:33,441 --> 01:03:35,211
Dad said he'll take a look around.

1233
01:03:35,211 --> 01:03:36,573
You call me tomorrow.

1234
01:03:36,573 --> 01:03:38,804
- All right, I love you.

1235
01:03:38,804 --> 01:03:41,342
- Hold on, hold on, here's Justin.

1236
01:03:41,342 --> 01:03:42,622
Here, it's daddy.

1237
01:03:42,622 --> 01:03:44,474
- Dad, when are you coming home?

1238
01:03:44,474 --> 01:03:47,399
- Hey, buddy, tomorrow night, I promise.

1239
01:03:47,399 --> 01:03:49,628
- But, dad, that's Christmas eve!

1240
01:03:49,628 --> 01:03:52,483
- I know, but bud, I got
to finish the job, right?

1241
01:03:52,483 --> 01:03:55,881
- Dad, you need to get here
before Santa gets here.

1242
01:03:55,881 --> 01:03:56,714
- Don't you worry.

1243
01:03:56,714 --> 01:03:59,100
I'll be home long before
Santa ever gets there.

1244
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:00,543
- You promise?

1245
01:04:00,543 --> 01:04:01,408
- Of course I do.

1246
01:04:01,408 --> 01:04:02,491
- You have to sign this.

1247
01:04:02,491 --> 01:04:04,009
- All right, buddy, I got to go.

1248
01:04:04,009 --> 01:04:05,038
I love you.

1249
01:04:05,038 --> 01:04:07,471
I'll see you tomorrow night.

1250
01:04:07,471 --> 01:04:08,304
Bye bye.

1251
01:04:11,634 --> 01:04:14,109

- We got heavy snow up in the pass.

1297
01:06:23,690 --> 01:06:25,590
We're closing the road down.

01:06:36,625 --> 01:06:38,915
Best thing you can do is get home safe.

1305
01:06:38,915 --> 01:06:41,625
So turn this around, and
have a merry Christmas.

1306
01:06:41,625 --> 01:06:44,625

- Hey, I wanted to give you these.

1312
01:06:56,774 --> 01:06:58,625
Normally, we keep them at the post office.

1313
01:06:58,625 --> 01:06:59,705
- What are they?

1314
01:06:59,705 --> 01:07:01,597
- Letters to Santa from your little boy.

1315
01:07:01,597 --> 01:07:04,015
And there's even one for Mrs. Claus.

1316
01:07:04,015 --> 01:07:06,694
- Hank, how thoughtful, thank you so much.

1317
01:07:06,694 --> 01:07:07,891
(phone rings)

1318
01:07:07,891 --> 01:07:09,651
- I'll let you get that,
merry Christmas now.

1319
01:07:09,651 --> 01:07:13,690
- Okay, thank you, merry Christmas, Hank.

1320
01:07:13,690 --> 01:07:14,523
Hello?

1323
01:07:16,782 --> 01:07:17,990
Hello, you're breaking up.

1324
01:07:17,990 --> 01:07:19,262
- Listen, it's snowing pretty hard.

1325
01:07:19,262 --> 01:07:20,521
They got the pass closed.

1326
01:07:20,521 --> 01:07:22,396
They're going to make me
go the long way around,

1327
01:07:22,396 --> 01:07:24,104
so I might be a little

1328
01:07:24,104 --> 01:07:27,487
- No, no if it's that bad,
I don't want you driving.

1329
01:07:27,487 --> 01:07:30,518
Just stay in a motel, you
can drive home tomorrow.

1330
01:07:30,518 --> 01:07:31,351
- Wait, what?

1331
01:07:31,351 --> 01:07:33,949
Steph, I'm sorry, I can't
hear you, you're breaking up.

1332
01:07:33,949 --> 01:07:36,388
- I said, don't come home.

1333
01:07:36,388 --> 01:07:37,721
Stay in a motel.

1334
01:07:38,709 --> 01:07:41,512
- Look, Steph, let me
see how far I can get.

1335
01:07:41,512 --> 01:07:42,618
If worse comes to worse,

1336
01:07:42,618 --> 01:07:45,414
I can stay in a motel in Springfield.

1337
01:07:45,414 --> 01:07:46,998
Steph?

1338
01:07:46,998 --> 01:07:48,248

1339
01:07:49,798 --> 01:07:50,631
Hello?

1340
01:07:52,764 --> 01:07:54,181
Looks like daddy is stuck in snow.

1341
01:07:54,181 --> 01:07:58,098
I don't ink he's going
to make it home tonight.

01:16:49,921 --> 01:16:52,504
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1427
01:16:57,521 --> 01:17:00,284
- Yes, I told you to stay away, fatso.

1428
01:17:00,284 --> 01:17:02,482
- No, Justin, it's okay.

1429
01:17:02,482 --> 01:17:03,367
Are you all right?

1430
01:17:03,367 --> 01:17:06,668
- Stay away from him,
mum, he's a dirty rat.

1431
01:17:06,668 --> 01:17:08,303
You're married to dad.

1432
01:17:08,303 --> 01:17:09,864
- Justin.

1433
01:17:09,864 --> 01:17:10,926
- Dad?

1434
01:17:10,926 --> 01:17:12,009
You're Santa?

1435
01:17:13,132 --> 01:17:14,277
- Yes, Justin.

1436
01:17:14,277 --> 01:17:16,528
Daddy is Santa Claus.

1437
01:17:16,528 --> 01:17:17,965
- Wait, Steph, he doesn't have to know.

1438
01:17:17,965 --> 01:17:21,888
- No, David, we have
to tell him the truth.

1439
01:17:21,888 --> 01:17:23,269
Justin.

1440
01:17:23,269 --> 01:17:26,503
Justin, the Santa you saw kissing mommy,

1441
01:17:26,503 --> 01:17:30,137
the one in the picture,
that wasn't really Santa.

1442
01:17:30,137 --> 01:17:31,387
That was daddy.

1443
01:17:32,344 --> 01:17:34,148
Daddy dressed like Santa.

1444
01:17:34,148 --> 01:17:35,574
- That's right, buddy.

1445
01:17:35,574 --> 01:17:37,991
Look, it's been me all along.

1446
01:17:40,898 --> 01:17:42,898
I'm like Santa's helper.

1447
01:17:48,542 --> 01:17:50,623
And I'm wet and I'm cold.

1448
01:17:50,623 --> 01:17:51,602
- So let's go inside, come on.

1449
01:17:51,602 --> 01:17:52,852
- I'm freezing.

1450
01:18:07,897 --> 01:18:11,123
It does look pretty incriminating, huh?

1451
01:18:11,123 --> 01:18:13,184
- I just wish you would
have come to us sooner.

1452
01:18:13,184 --> 01:18:16,732
- I tried at school but then
dad called on the cell phone,

1453
01:18:16,732 --> 01:18:18,351
and you called him Santa.

1454
01:18:18,351 --> 01:18:19,184
- Oh, yes.

1455
01:18:21,616 --> 01:18:23,727
I'm glad we got this straightened out.

1456
01:18:23,727 --> 01:18:25,464
But you know what, guys?

1457
01:18:25,464 --> 01:18:26,353
It is getting late.

1458
01:18:26,353 --> 01:18:28,756
- Yeah, time to hit the sack, buddy.

1459
01:18:28,756 --> 01:18:30,448
- Okay, good night.

1460
01:18:30,448 --> 01:18:31,281
- Let's go.

1461
01:18:31,281 --> 01:18:32,114
- Merry Christmas.

1462
01:18:32,114 --> 01:18:33,161
- Merry Christmas.

1463
01:18:33,161 --> 01:18:35,078
I'll be up in a minute.

1464
01:18:52,937 --> 01:18:53,770
Oh!

1465
01:18:55,090 --> 01:18:55,923
Hot, hot!

1466
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:04,760
(bells jingling)

1467
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:05,843
- Ho, ho, ho!

1468
01:19:18,188 --> 01:19:20,438
(laughing)

1469
01:19:21,669 --> 01:19:24,047
That's going to leave a mark.

1470
01:19:24,047 --> 01:19:24,880
Ho ho ho!

1471
01:19:29,767 --> 01:19:30,600
Let's see.

1472
01:19:33,981 --> 01:19:35,314
Oh, that's nice.

1473
01:19:39,276 --> 01:19:40,193
- Mum, dad.

1474
01:19:41,301 --> 01:19:42,812
Mum, dad.

1475
01:19:42,812 --> 01:19:45,562
(Santa laughing)

1476
01:19:58,105 --> 01:20:00,105
- [Santa] Where to next?

1477
01:20:02,179 --> 01:20:06,522
Merry Christmas to all,
and to all a good night.

1478
01:20:06,522 --> 01:20:07,772
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

1479
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:29,673
- Whoa!

1480
01:20:41,118 --> 01:20:43,951
Mum, dad, look what Santa brought.

1481
01:20:45,708 --> 01:20:47,115
- You found his toy?

1482
01:20:47,115 --> 01:20:49,722
- No, I didn't have time
to stop on the way home.

1483
01:20:49,722 --> 01:20:52,110
You mean, you didn't?

1484
01:20:52,110 --> 01:20:53,269
- No.

1485
01:20:53,269 --> 01:20:55,936
(laser effects)

1486
01:21:03,484 --> 01:21:04,317
- Come on.

1487
01:21:04,317 --> 01:21:05,150
- No.

1488
01:21:05,150 --> 01:21:05,983
- Come on.

1489
01:21:11,335 --> 01:21:14,850
(doorbell rings)

1490
01:21:14,850 --> 01:21:15,683
- Oh, hi.

1491
01:21:17,084 --> 01:21:17,917
- Merry Christmas.

1492
01:21:17,917 --> 01:21:18,750
- Welcome.

1493
01:21:19,739 --> 01:21:20,572
- Merry Christmas.

1494
01:21:20,572 --> 01:21:21,597
- Feliz navidad.

1495
01:21:21,597 --> 01:21:22,586
- The house looks beautiful.

1496
01:21:22,586 --> 01:21:23,836
- Smells great.

1497
01:21:24,877 --> 01:21:26,377
- Thanks, sweetie.

1498
01:21:29,077 --> 01:21:30,936
- You and Sal?

1499
01:21:30,936 --> 01:21:31,930
- Yeah.

1500
01:21:31,930 --> 01:21:36,772
Football is not that bad,
once you get to know it.

1501
01:21:36,772 --> 01:21:37,765
- I knew you'd come around.

1502
01:21:37,765 --> 01:21:41,114
(doorbell rings)

1503
01:21:41,114 --> 01:21:42,066
Dad, merry Christmas.

1504
01:21:42,066 --> 01:21:43,354
- Merry Christmas.

1505
01:21:43,354 --> 01:21:44,388
- Ms. Crumley.

1506
01:21:44,388 --> 01:21:45,221
- Merry Christmas.

1507
01:21:45,221 --> 01:21:46,601
Please, call me Betty.

1508
01:21:46,601 --> 01:21:48,934
- Okay, thank you, go on in.

1509
01:21:52,016 --> 01:21:53,500
- Dad?

1510
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:54,333
- Yeah.

1511
01:21:55,525 --> 01:21:56,978
I feel terrible.

1512
01:21:56,978 --> 01:22:00,567
I couldn't find that
commando toy anywhere.

1513
01:22:00,567 --> 01:22:01,971
- What are you talking about?

1514
01:22:01,971 --> 01:22:05,471
- You know, the toy Justin wanted so much.

1515
01:22:07,340 --> 01:22:09,574
- You didn't drop it by last night?

1516
01:22:09,574 --> 01:22:10,491
- What, no.

1517
01:22:11,639 --> 01:22:12,843
- Grandpa, grandpa.

1518
01:22:12,843 --> 01:22:15,260
- Hey, look at you, commando.

1519
01:22:17,579 --> 01:22:20,184
- Hey, Irwin, Christmas!

1520
01:22:20,184 --> 01:22:23,534
(doorbell rings)

1521
01:22:23,534 --> 01:22:24,367
- Merry Christmas!

1522
01:22:24,367 --> 01:22:25,269
- Merry Christmas!

1523
01:22:25,269 --> 01:22:26,227
- Justin!

1524
01:22:26,227 --> 01:22:27,060
- Bobby.

1525
01:22:27,060 --> 01:22:28,784
- Oh come in, come in, come in.

1526
01:22:28,784 --> 01:22:30,372
So glad you stopped by.

1527
01:22:30,372 --> 01:22:34,016
- We just wanted to stop by
and drop off this fruitcake.

1528
01:22:34,016 --> 01:22:36,222
- You shouldn't have.

1529
01:22:36,222 --> 01:22:37,670
- And we also wanted to let you know

1530
01:22:37,670 --> 01:22:41,062
that Marie and I have
decided to work things out.

1531
01:22:41,062 --> 01:22:43,298
- We're going to see a counselor.

1532
01:22:43,298 --> 01:22:45,985
- I am so happy to hear that.

1533
01:22:45,985 --> 01:22:49,568
Please, please, come
in, have some egg nog.

1534
01:22:52,298 --> 01:22:54,614
- Did Santa give you
everything you wanted?

1535
01:22:54,614 --> 01:22:55,447
- You bet.

1536
01:23:00,085 --> 01:23:02,653
- See, being good has got its advantages.

1537
01:23:02,653 --> 01:23:04,880
- Yeah, and it wasn't
as hard as I thought.

1538
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:07,963
- Job complete, operation successful.

1539
01:23:10,344 --> 01:23:13,594
- Come on, let's go blast some mutants.

1540
01:23:19,067 --> 01:23:20,592
- Merry Christmas.

1541
01:23:20,592 --> 01:23:22,675
- Merry Christmas, honey.

1542
01:23:42,511 --> 01:23:45,729
- [Justin] Hey, Bobby,
Santa does land on the roof.

1543
01:23:45,729 --> 01:23:47,051
- [Bobby] How do you know?

1544
01:23:47,051 --> 01:23:49,801
- [Justin] Trust me, I just know.

1545
01:23:58,095 --> 01:24:00,845
(doorbell rings)

1546
01:24:02,393 --> 01:24:04,248
- Ho, ho, ho, merry Christmas.

1547
01:24:04,248 --> 01:24:05,366
- Oh, merry Christmas.

1548
01:24:05,366 --> 01:24:09,366
We're out taking holiday
contributions for the--
