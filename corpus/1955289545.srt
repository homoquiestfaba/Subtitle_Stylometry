00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:21,833
**[military drum beat]

2
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:32,625
Man, narrating: Langford.

3
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:35,683
Langford.

4
00:01:36,917 --> 00:01:39,250
If only if it hadn't been for Langford.

5
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:42,750
How happy we might have been.

6
00:01:55,167 --> 00:01:56,833
Manwaring!

7
00:01:56,958 --> 00:02:01,250
Manwaring, don't turn
your back to me, please!

8
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:02,875
I can't bear it!

9
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,833
Frederica!

10
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,750
Wait! I beg you!

11
00:03:08,167 --> 00:03:10,292
Catherine, a letter.

12
00:03:10,417 --> 00:03:14,583
Seems Lady Susan will finally visit.
In fact, she is already on her way.

13
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:17,042
- What?
- Lady Susan Vernon?

14
00:03:17,167 --> 00:03:19,625
Congratulations on
being about to receive

15
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,958
the most accomplished
flirt in all England.

16
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:25,000
- You misjudge her, Reginald.
- How so?

17
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:27,833
Well, like many women
of beauty and distinction,

18
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:31,584
our sister-in-law has been a victim of
the spirit of jealousy and all that.

19
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:34,334
- It's jealousy?
- Yes.

20
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:36,250
Well, like anyone,
Susan might be capable

21
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,917
of an action or a remark
which is open to misconstruction,

22
00:03:39,042 --> 00:03:40,459
but I can't help
but admire the fortitude

23
00:03:40,584 --> 00:03:43,334
with which she has
supported grave misfortune.

24
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:45,917
Excuse me.
I spoke out of turn.

25
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,625
Why would Lady Susan,
who was so well settled at Langford

26
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,834
- suddenly want to visit us?
- What reason does she give?

27
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:59,542
Her "anxiety to meet me
and to know the children"

28
00:03:59,667 --> 00:04:01,625
has never concerned her before.

29
00:04:26,334 --> 00:04:27,934
Your Ladyship.

30
00:04:29,084 --> 00:04:31,459
Susan. Come, hurry.

31
00:04:31,584 --> 00:04:34,334
My dear, such haste.
How curious you are.

32
00:04:34,459 --> 00:04:37,375
Mr. Johnson's carriage is about
to come into the street.

33
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,834
Surely that must happen often.

34
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:42,834
- You didn't receive my letter.
- Letter?

35
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:44,709
Mr. Johnson forbids
my seeing you.

36
00:04:44,834 --> 00:04:48,209
Why, that's preposterous.
By what means "forbids?"

37
00:04:48,334 --> 00:04:50,750
He threatens the severest
punishment imaginable:

38
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,792
sending me back to Connecticut.

39
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,792
Oh, to be tarred and feathered.

40
00:04:54,917 --> 00:04:57,792
He claims to have important
business at Hartford.

41
00:04:57,917 --> 00:05:00,917
He threatens to settle there if our
connection isn't entirely severed.

42
00:05:01,042 --> 00:05:04,042
And for what possible
reason or pretext?

43
00:05:04,167 --> 00:05:07,417
His former ward Lucy
Manwaring wrote to him.

44
00:05:07,542 --> 00:05:09,167
Did she?

45
00:05:15,084 --> 00:05:17,209
- Horrid woman.
- I know.

46
00:05:17,334 --> 00:05:19,372
Deranged.
If she were going to be jealous,

47
00:05:19,497 --> 00:05:22,125
she should not have married
such a charming man.

48
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,917
I recall thinking
as I approached Langford,

49
00:05:26,042 --> 00:05:29,917
I like this man.
Pray heaven no harm come of it.

50
00:05:30,042 --> 00:05:33,125
I was determined to be discrete,
and I have been,

51
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,000
admitting no one's attentions
but Manwaring's,

52
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:37,792
avoiding general flirtation entirely...

53
00:05:37,917 --> 00:05:40,667
except for a little notice
bestowed on Sir James Martin,

54
00:05:40,792 --> 00:05:42,910
but if the world knew my motive there,
it would honor me.

55
00:05:43,035 --> 00:05:45,459
- Martin?
- Sir James Martin,

56
00:05:45,584 --> 00:05:47,459
of Martindale.

57
00:05:47,584 --> 00:05:50,750
- Vastly rich, rather simple.
- Ideal.

58
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,834
Miss Maria Manwaring
has set her cap for him,

59
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:55,792
considering such an income too large
not to be shared,

60
00:05:55,917 --> 00:05:59,584
but with a little notice, I detached him
and soon had him in love with Frederica.

61
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:02,625
If my daughter were not the
greatest simpleton on earth,

62
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,292
- she'd be engaged to him now.
- What?

63
00:06:05,417 --> 00:06:08,792
She refused him...
a baronet with 10,000 a year.

64
00:06:08,917 --> 00:06:11,792
- It's all so provoking.
- But where will you live?

65
00:06:11,917 --> 00:06:15,459
If there were another place open to me,
I would crawl there on my knees.

66
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:17,959
The worst spot this side of the ocean.

67
00:06:18,084 --> 00:06:21,292
A country village.
Churchill, my brother-in-law's seat.

68
00:06:21,417 --> 00:06:24,959
Mrs. Cross, a gentlewoman
in strait and circumstances,

69
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:26,834
will come with me as my companion,

70
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:30,667
to pack and unpack, you know,
that sort of thing.

71
00:06:30,792 --> 00:06:32,959
And, as there's an element
of friendship involved,

72
00:06:33,084 --> 00:06:36,042
I'm sure the paying of wages
would be offensive to us both.

73
00:06:41,084 --> 00:06:44,000
My brother-in-law
Charles Vernon is very rich.

74
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:47,084
Once a man gets his name on a
banking house, he rolls in money.

75
00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:51,459
So it's not very rational for his lady
to begrudge the sums he's advanced me.

76
00:06:51,584 --> 00:06:53,459
Decidedly irrational.
Not rational at all.

77
00:06:53,584 --> 00:06:55,959
I have no money and no husband.

78
00:06:56,084 --> 00:06:59,959
Well, in one's plight, they say,
is one's opportunity.

79
00:07:00,084 --> 00:07:02,834
Not that I would ever want to think
in opportunistic terms.

80
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:05,209
Oh, certainly not. Never.

81
00:07:05,334 --> 00:07:09,042
Churchill coming
into view, Your Ladyship.

82
00:07:11,584 --> 00:07:13,459
Heavens, what a bore.

83
00:07:13,584 --> 00:07:17,084
Yes. Decidedly boring.

84
00:07:43,167 --> 00:07:44,584
Charles.

85
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:47,750
- Susan, welcome.
- Thank you.

86
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:50,584
- This is Mrs. Cross.
- Mrs. Cross.

87
00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:54,209
You're quite welcome to Churchill.
This is Frederick and Ellen.

88
00:07:55,459 --> 00:07:58,792
Good afternoon, Frederick.
Very pleased to meet you.

89
00:07:58,917 --> 00:08:00,917
Mrs. Cross is a friend
of Lady Susan

90
00:08:01,042 --> 00:08:03,709
and should be in the adjoining room.

91
00:08:18,917 --> 00:08:21,875
No reason to complain
of Mr. Vernon's reception.

92
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,337
Not entirely satisfied with his lady's.

93
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,250
- No?
- Mm-mm.

94
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:29,292
She's perfectly well bred...
surprisingly so.

95
00:08:29,417 --> 00:08:33,084
But her manner doesn't persuade me
she was disposed in my favor.

96
00:08:33,209 --> 00:08:35,917
As you might have noticed,
I sought to be as amiable as possible.

97
00:08:36,042 --> 00:08:39,584
Exceptionally amiable.
In fact, entirely charming.

98
00:08:39,709 --> 00:08:42,917
- Excuse me for saying so.
- Oh, not at all. It's true.

99
00:08:43,042 --> 00:08:47,459
I wanted her to be delighted with me,
but I didn't succeed.

100
00:08:47,584 --> 00:08:49,184
I can't understand it.

101
00:08:50,584 --> 00:08:52,625
It's true I've always detested her

102
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:56,250
and that, before her marriage,
I went to great lengths to prevent it.

103
00:08:56,375 --> 00:09:00,125
Yet it shows an illiberal spirit to resent
for long a plan which didn't succeed.

104
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:03,292
Decidedly illiberal.
Not liberal at all.

105
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:04,959
My opposing her marriage

106
00:09:05,084 --> 00:09:08,625
and then later preventing her and
Charles from buying Vernon Castle

107
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,334
might have given her
an unfavorable impression of me,

108
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:14,459
but I've noticed that where
there's a disposition to dislike,

109
00:09:14,584 --> 00:09:16,125
a pretext will soon be found.

110
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:19,500
- You mustn't reproach yourself.
- I shan't. The past is done.

111
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,500
My project will be the children.

112
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:23,292
I know a couple of their names already,

113
00:09:23,417 --> 00:09:26,375
and I've decided to attach myself
to young Frederick in particular...

114
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,459
taking him on my lap and sighing
over him for his dear aunt's sake.

115
00:09:30,584 --> 00:09:31,917
[knock on door]

116
00:09:32,042 --> 00:09:33,642
Come in.

117
00:09:35,584 --> 00:09:38,292
Mrs. Vernon's compliments,
Your Ladyship.

118
00:09:38,417 --> 00:09:41,334
She asks if you and Mrs. Cross
would join her for tea.

119
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:42,953
With pleasure.

120
00:09:43,078 --> 00:09:46,750
Mrs. Cross would prefer her repose,
but thank Mrs. Vernon.

121
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,475
I'll join her directly.

122
00:09:51,584 --> 00:09:53,292
[woman speaking French]

123
00:09:53,417 --> 00:09:56,292
Susan: Yes, Frederick, I see
you have quite an appetite.

124
00:09:56,417 --> 00:09:58,292
You will grow tall and
handsome like your uncle.

125
00:09:58,417 --> 00:10:00,209
- [Frederick giggles]
- Ellen: Fred, dear, be good.

126
00:10:00,334 --> 00:10:01,625
[speaking French]

127
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,209
Ellen:
Don't touch that.

128
00:10:03,334 --> 00:10:04,292
[crash]

129
00:10:04,417 --> 00:10:07,084
Frederick, be careful.
Oh, I'm so sorry.

130
00:10:07,209 --> 00:10:09,625
- No, not at all.
- <i>Les enfants...</i>

131
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,625
Such a family resemblance.
Rather moves me.

132
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,167
You'll want to change.

133
00:10:14,292 --> 00:10:16,917
No, no. Let's have our tea
while it's still warm.

134
00:10:17,042 --> 00:10:18,875
Mrs. Cross is a genius
with fabrics.

135
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,792
- You sure?
- Oh, yes.

136
00:10:20,917 --> 00:10:24,292
How much Frederick reminds
me of his dear uncle.

137
00:10:24,417 --> 00:10:26,167
Do you think there's a resemblance?

138
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,500
Oh, remarkable.
The eyes.

139
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:31,834
Weren't Frederick Vernon's eyes brown?

140
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:35,001
I refer more to the shape
and slope of the brow.

141
00:10:35,126 --> 00:10:35,834
Oh.

142
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:38,292
I must thank you for this visit.

143
00:10:38,417 --> 00:10:41,209
I'm afraid the short notice
must have come as a surprise.

144
00:10:41,334 --> 00:10:44,334
Only because I understood you
to be so happily settled at Langford.

145
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:48,584
Well, it's true Lady Manwaring and
her husband made me feel very welcome,

146
00:10:48,709 --> 00:10:52,584
but their outgoing dispositions
led them so often into society.

147
00:10:52,709 --> 00:10:55,001
I might have tolerated
such a life at one time,

148
00:10:55,126 --> 00:10:59,459
but the loss of a husband such as
Mr. Vernon cannot be borne easily.

149
00:10:59,584 --> 00:11:02,126
To stay with you here at your...

150
00:11:02,251 --> 00:11:05,459
charming environment
became my fondest wish.

151
00:11:05,584 --> 00:11:08,417
I was happy to have the chance to meet.

152
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:10,751
Might I confide something?

153
00:11:10,876 --> 00:11:13,292
Langford was not ideal for my daughter.

154
00:11:13,417 --> 00:11:16,751
Her education has been neglected,
for which I fault myself.

155
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:20,001
Mr. Vernon's illness prevented
me from giving her the attention

156
00:11:20,126 --> 00:11:22,084
that both duty and affection required.

157
00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:25,959
I therefore placed her at this
excellent school: Miss Somers-Keeve's.

158
00:11:26,084 --> 00:11:28,084
I trust Frederica will visit soon.

159
00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:30,876
Well, a visit, as delightful
as that might be,

160
00:11:31,001 --> 00:11:32,959
would represent so many hours and days

161
00:11:33,084 --> 00:11:35,209
deducted from the grand
affair of education,

162
00:11:35,334 --> 00:11:39,251
and I'm afraid Frederica can't
afford such deductions.

163
00:11:39,376 --> 00:11:41,334
But she'll come for Christmas.

164
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:42,709
Alas, no.

165
00:11:42,834 --> 00:11:46,959
Miss Somers could only give her the
concentrated attention she requires then.

166
00:11:47,084 --> 00:11:49,509
- I'm so sorry.
- Not at all.

167
00:11:49,634 --> 00:11:51,792
If you'll excuse me,
I'll give it to Mrs. Cross,

168
00:11:51,917 --> 00:11:54,459
who, when rested, craves activity.

169
00:11:54,584 --> 00:11:56,251
Once she's applied her genius to it,

170
00:11:56,376 --> 00:12:00,309
all traces of little Frederick's
interesting design will disappear.

171
00:12:02,751 --> 00:12:04,459
The fees at Frederica's school

172
00:12:04,584 --> 00:12:06,709
are far too high
to even think of paying.

173
00:12:06,834 --> 00:12:09,084
So in a sense it's an economy.

174
00:12:27,751 --> 00:12:31,584
Yes, although Mrs. Cross
is upstairs resting.

175
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:34,834
I confess to curiosity
to know this lady,

176
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,334
to see firsthand her bewitching powers.

177
00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:40,459
- Is she as beautiful as they say?
- You worry me, Reginald.

178
00:12:40,584 --> 00:12:45,459
Don't. I understand Lady Susan
possesses a degree of captivating deceit

179
00:12:45,584 --> 00:12:48,917
- which might be pleasing to detect.
- You truly worry me.

180
00:12:49,042 --> 00:12:50,584
Good evening.

181
00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:53,792
What charming expressions.

182
00:12:53,917 --> 00:12:57,626
Susan, uh, let me introduce
my brother Reginald DeCourcy.

183
00:12:57,751 --> 00:12:59,834
Reginald, may I present
Frederick Vernon's widow

184
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:03,042
Lady Susan and her
friend Mrs. Cross?

185
00:13:05,834 --> 00:13:07,792
Delighted to make your acquaintance.

186
00:13:07,917 --> 00:13:10,084
Your renown precedes you.

187
00:13:11,417 --> 00:13:13,584
I'm afraid the allusion escapes me.

188
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,501
Your reputation

189
00:13:15,626 --> 00:13:17,584
as an ornament to our society.

190
00:13:17,709 --> 00:13:19,917
Oh, what you say surprises me.

191
00:13:20,042 --> 00:13:22,376
Since the great sadness
of my husband's death,

192
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:24,584
I've lived in nearly perfect isolation.

193
00:13:24,709 --> 00:13:28,584
To better know his family and to
further remove myself from society,

194
00:13:28,709 --> 00:13:30,042
I came to Churchill,

195
00:13:30,167 --> 00:13:32,292
not to make new acquaintances
of frivolous sort,

196
00:13:32,417 --> 00:13:36,251
but of course I'm pleased
to know my sister's relations.

197
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:41,917
** [woman singing opera]

198
00:14:12,167 --> 00:14:15,653
Mrs. Cross: I take it you are finding
Mr. DeCourcy's society more pleasurable.

199
00:14:15,778 --> 00:14:17,292
To some degree.

200
00:14:17,417 --> 00:14:21,126
At first, his conversation
betrayed a sauciness and familiarity 

201
00:14:21,251 --> 00:14:23,459
which is my aversion,
but since I've found

202
00:14:23,584 --> 00:14:26,626
a quality of callow idleness
which rather interests me.

203
00:14:26,751 --> 00:14:28,917
When I've inspired him
with greater respect

204
00:14:29,042 --> 00:14:31,084
than his sister's kind
offices have allowed,

205
00:14:31,209 --> 00:14:35,209
- he might in fact be an agreeable flirt.
- He's handsome, isn't he?

206
00:14:35,334 --> 00:14:37,792
In a cough-like way...
not like Manwaring, of course,

207
00:14:37,917 --> 00:14:42,334
but there's a certain pleasure in
making a person predetermined to dislike

208
00:14:42,459 --> 00:14:44,709
instead acknowledge one's superiority.

209
00:14:44,834 --> 00:14:49,209
How delightful it will be to humble
the pride of these pompous DeCourcys.

210
00:15:08,334 --> 00:15:09,959
A letter for you, my dear.

211
00:15:10,084 --> 00:15:12,251
- Letter?
- Yes, from Catherine.

212
00:15:14,251 --> 00:15:15,959
I hope she'll arrive soon.

213
00:15:16,084 --> 00:15:19,709
The season's cheerless
without children.

214
00:15:21,584 --> 00:15:22,792
Well?

215
00:15:22,917 --> 00:15:25,334
I'm afraid this cold
has affected my eyes.

216
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:27,667
Save your eyes, my dear.
I'll read for you.

217
00:15:27,792 --> 00:15:30,292
- No, it's all right.
- No, I just...

218
00:15:30,417 --> 00:15:32,732
Here. Uh...

219
00:15:32,857 --> 00:15:34,584
Let's see.

220
00:15:34,709 --> 00:15:36,126
Mm.

221
00:15:36,251 --> 00:15:37,709
Catherine hopes you are well

222
00:15:37,834 --> 00:15:40,459
and asks most particularly
that you give me her love.

223
00:15:40,584 --> 00:15:42,209
Yes, and?

224
00:15:42,334 --> 00:15:43,934
Uh...

225
00:15:45,751 --> 00:15:49,626
Oh, Reginald has decided to stay
at Churchill to hunt with Charles.

226
00:15:49,751 --> 00:15:53,459
He cites the fine open weather. What
nonsense. The weather's not open at all.

227
00:15:53,584 --> 00:15:57,584
Well, maybe it is there, or it was when
she wrote. My dear, could you just read?

228
00:15:57,709 --> 00:15:59,626
- Verbatim?
- Yes, the words.

229
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:01,584
Some of Catherine's
voice will be in them.

230
00:16:01,709 --> 00:16:05,376
Well, I'll read every word, comma,
and dash if that's what you wish.

231
00:16:05,501 --> 00:16:07,101
Here...

232
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,084
Just the words, please.

233
00:16:18,209 --> 00:16:21,976
No punctuation at all?
All right. That's much easier.

234
00:16:29,584 --> 00:16:32,709
- Lady Susan?
- Yes, she has been visiting Churchill.

235
00:16:32,834 --> 00:16:34,876
- Lady Susan Vernon?
- Yes.

236
00:16:36,126 --> 00:16:41,126
Well, how could Reginald engage in
conversations with Lady Susan Vernon?

237
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:43,126
Conversations which are...

238
00:16:45,626 --> 00:16:46,834
What would they talk about?

239
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,660
My eyes have definitely cleared.
I can read it. Don't trouble yourself.

240
00:16:49,785 --> 00:16:54,184
No, no. If my son and heir's involved
with such a lady, I must trouble myself.

241
00:17:06,001 --> 00:17:07,459
[clock chimes]

242
00:17:07,584 --> 00:17:10,292
- Well, I must go.
- No. I'll write.

243
00:17:10,417 --> 00:17:13,142
No, no.
If this is happening, there's no time.

244
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:26,059
Thank you.

245
00:17:33,293 --> 00:17:34,709
- Father.
- Reginald.

246
00:17:34,834 --> 00:17:36,626
How extraordinary for you to be here.

247
00:17:36,751 --> 00:17:39,584
- You're in good health, I trust?
- No.

248
00:17:39,709 --> 00:17:42,168
How's Mother?

249
00:17:42,293 --> 00:17:44,043
What brings you to these parts?

250
00:17:44,168 --> 00:17:45,501
Take a seat.

251
00:17:45,626 --> 00:17:48,251
I won't dissemble and say I
have business in the district.

252
00:17:48,376 --> 00:17:50,834
What I've come about is more important.

253
00:17:50,959 --> 00:17:52,834
What's of such importance?

254
00:17:52,959 --> 00:17:56,584
I know young men don't admit inquiry
into affairs of the heart,

255
00:17:56,709 --> 00:18:00,251
but, as the sole son
of an ancient family,

256
00:18:00,376 --> 00:18:03,251
you must know that your conduct
is most important to us.

257
00:18:03,376 --> 00:18:07,084
Your happiness, ours, the credit of
the family name, its very survival...

258
00:18:07,209 --> 00:18:08,959
- Father.
- No, no, no. Hear me out.

259
00:18:09,084 --> 00:18:12,918
I know that you'd not deliberately form
an engagement without informing us.

260
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:18,126
But I can't help fear
that you'll fall into an obligation

261
00:18:18,251 --> 00:18:20,459
which everyone near you must oppose.

262
00:18:20,584 --> 00:18:23,459
- What do you mean, sir?
- Well, Lady Susan Vernon's age alone...

263
00:18:23,584 --> 00:18:25,418
Father, you astonish me.

264
00:18:25,543 --> 00:18:26,834
What surprises you?

265
00:18:26,959 --> 00:18:30,709
Impugning such ambitions to Lady Susan.
She'd never think of such a thing.

266
00:18:30,834 --> 00:18:35,751
My sole interest has been to enjoy the
lively conversation of a superior lady.

267
00:18:35,876 --> 00:18:37,959
Catherine's prejudice is so great.

268
00:18:38,084 --> 00:18:41,209
Prejudice? Lady Susan's
neglect of her late husband,

269
00:18:41,334 --> 00:18:42,793
her extravagance and dissipation,

270
00:18:42,918 --> 00:18:45,418
her encouragement of other men
are so notorious...

271
00:18:45,543 --> 00:18:47,143
These are vile calumnies.

272
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:51,084
I could explain each
but would not so dignify them.

273
00:18:53,418 --> 00:18:56,709
- I know you spend little time in society.
- Oh, none.

274
00:18:56,834 --> 00:18:59,626
Should you have frequented it more,
you'd know the astonishing degree

275
00:18:59,751 --> 00:19:01,751
of vile, hateful jealousy
in our country.

276
00:19:01,876 --> 00:19:04,043
Don't deprecate our country, sir.

277
00:19:07,251 --> 00:19:09,751
I can't prevent you
inheriting the family estate,

278
00:19:09,876 --> 00:19:12,084
and my ability to distress
you during my life

279
00:19:12,209 --> 00:19:14,459
is not the kind of revenge
that I would choose to take.

280
00:19:14,584 --> 00:19:17,293
- Father, this is unnecessary.
- No, no. Let me continue.

281
00:19:17,418 --> 00:19:22,168
A permanent connection
between you and Lady Susan Vernon

282
00:19:22,293 --> 00:19:25,043
would destroy every
comfort of our lives.

283
00:19:25,168 --> 00:19:29,126
It would be the death
of the honest pride

284
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:32,126
with which we've always considered you.

285
00:19:32,251 --> 00:19:35,918
We'd blush to see you, to hear of you,
to think of you.

286
00:19:36,043 --> 00:19:37,334
Father,

287
00:19:37,459 --> 00:19:41,251
with the utmost humility,
let me say that what you imagine...

288
00:19:42,418 --> 00:19:44,018
is impossible.

289
00:19:59,959 --> 00:20:01,626
Susan:
Poor Mrs. Cross was obliged

290
00:20:01,751 --> 00:20:03,959
to accept a paid position
in Buckinghamshire.

291
00:20:04,084 --> 00:20:06,793
As there was an element
of friendship between us,

292
00:20:06,918 --> 00:20:09,584
I realized the paying of wages
would be offensive to us both.

293
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,251
You value friendship highly.

294
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,834
Yes. I hope I was
of some help to her.

295
00:20:13,959 --> 00:20:16,001
And your friends don't neglect you.

296
00:20:19,126 --> 00:20:20,793
Thank you, Charles.

297
00:20:24,501 --> 00:20:26,668
It's from Frederica's school.

298
00:20:32,084 --> 00:20:34,251
No.

299
00:20:34,376 --> 00:20:37,334
I can't believe it.
It defies comprehension.

300
00:20:37,459 --> 00:20:40,084
- What?
- Frederica has run away.

301
00:20:40,209 --> 00:20:43,334
- She's run away from school.
- Heavens. Where to?

302
00:20:43,459 --> 00:20:46,293
- They don't know.
- She's lost?

303
00:20:46,418 --> 00:20:49,751
No. They detected her plan
early enough to intercept her.

304
00:20:49,876 --> 00:20:52,168
What folly. Where could she
have thought of going?

305
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:53,459
Surely here.

306
00:20:53,584 --> 00:20:56,251
No, this is the last
place she would come.

307
00:20:56,376 --> 00:20:59,584
- I mean, rather...
- But she must miss you terribly.

308
00:20:59,709 --> 00:21:03,709
Certainly. I just don't think
Churchill would be her object.

309
00:21:03,834 --> 00:21:06,084
Oh. This is outrageous.

310
00:21:06,209 --> 00:21:09,876
Miss Somers requires
that Frederica be removed from school.

311
00:21:10,001 --> 00:21:13,168
Miss Somers must be under the impression
that, as a widow without fortune,

312
00:21:13,293 --> 00:21:16,918
I may be bullied. Evidently she's
forgotten Frederica is a Vernon.

313
00:21:17,043 --> 00:21:19,126
But Charles must put this right.

314
00:21:19,251 --> 00:21:21,126
Confronted with his imposing words,

315
00:21:21,251 --> 00:21:24,584
even the mistress of a school
must be persuaded to act rightly.

316
00:21:32,751 --> 00:21:34,293
[bell tolls]

317
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:37,626
I have no notion of Frederica
being so contrary.

318
00:21:37,751 --> 00:21:39,876
She seemed all Vernon milkiness.

319
00:21:40,001 --> 00:21:43,793
But it confirms the rightness
of my plan. Did Sir James call?

320
00:21:43,918 --> 00:21:45,793
- Several times.
- Excellent.

321
00:21:45,918 --> 00:21:47,834
I followed your instructions,

322
00:21:47,959 --> 00:21:51,584
scolding him roundly for making
love to Maria Manwaring.

323
00:21:51,709 --> 00:21:54,084
He protested that it had
only been in joke.

324
00:21:54,209 --> 00:21:56,459
You're right.
He's wonderfully silly.

325
00:21:56,584 --> 00:21:59,584
But we must not let Sir James forget
with whom he's in love.

326
00:21:59,709 --> 00:22:02,584
A man so rich and foolish
will not remain single long.

327
00:22:02,709 --> 00:22:04,834
Sir James is so far from
having forgotten the Vernons,

328
00:22:04,959 --> 00:22:07,584
I'm sure he'd marry either
of you in an instant.

329
00:22:07,709 --> 00:22:09,626
I must go back to Churchill.

330
00:22:09,751 --> 00:22:11,959
But I may need your help
finding a school

331
00:22:12,084 --> 00:22:14,084
if Miss Somers
won't take Frederica back.

332
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:17,001
Under no circumstances will I
have Frederica at Churchill.

333
00:22:17,126 --> 00:22:18,251
That's wise.

334
00:22:18,376 --> 00:22:20,168
What do you mean?

335
00:22:20,293 --> 00:22:23,918
The nearness of their ages,
her and Reginald's.

336
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:25,293
How unkind.

337
00:22:25,418 --> 00:22:27,584
- Forgive me.
- Forgiven.

338
00:22:27,709 --> 00:22:29,084
The fallacy of youth.

339
00:22:29,209 --> 00:22:33,043
Isn't it rather clear that it is we,
women of decision, who hold the trumps?

340
00:22:34,168 --> 00:22:36,876
Lady Susan?
Lady Susan Vernon.

341
00:22:37,001 --> 00:22:38,793
How dare you address me, sir.

342
00:22:38,918 --> 00:22:42,309
- But, Lady Susan...
- Begone, sir, or I will have you whipped.

343
00:22:43,334 --> 00:22:45,918
- Outrageous.
- Have you never met him?

344
00:22:46,043 --> 00:22:49,334
No. I know him well. I would never
speak to a stranger like that.

345
00:23:00,251 --> 00:23:02,459
I hope you will see my friend Alicia.

346
00:23:02,584 --> 00:23:06,793
She's an American from the Connecticut
branch of the Delancey family.

347
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:10,834
Well, though even the best bred
Americans don't sound particularly fine,

348
00:23:10,959 --> 00:23:14,251
there's a freshness to her manner
I find rather tonic.

349
00:23:14,376 --> 00:23:17,793
Her family were treated outrageously
there during the late war,

350
00:23:17,918 --> 00:23:20,001
punished for their very
loyalty to the Crown.

351
00:23:20,126 --> 00:23:23,168
Americans really have shown themselves
to be a nation of ingrates.

352
00:23:23,293 --> 00:23:27,126
Only by having children can one begin
to understand such a dynamic.

353
00:23:27,251 --> 00:23:28,851
Yes.

354
00:23:36,751 --> 00:23:38,709
Susan, I've been looking for you.

355
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,834
The afternoon coach brought this note.

356
00:23:42,043 --> 00:23:44,918
Perhaps Charles has
succeeded with Miss Somers.

357
00:23:50,418 --> 00:23:52,018
Oh, it's as I've feared.

358
00:23:52,143 --> 00:23:54,668
Miss Somers refuses to keep Frederica.

359
00:23:54,793 --> 00:23:57,209
She says she must think
of her school's reputation.

360
00:23:57,334 --> 00:24:00,001
Preposterous. I've never
heard of her school.

361
00:24:04,959 --> 00:24:07,959
- Could that be them?
- What, Frederica?

362
00:24:08,084 --> 00:24:10,251
Here.

363
00:24:10,376 --> 00:24:12,376
Hello, hello. Here we are.

364
00:24:12,501 --> 00:24:14,334
- Is this Frederica?
- Yes.

365
00:24:14,459 --> 00:24:17,709
Allow me to introduce
our niece... charming girl...

366
00:24:17,834 --> 00:24:19,584
uh, Miss Frederica Vernon.

367
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:22,751
Welcome, Frederica.
We've longed to know you.

368
00:24:22,876 --> 00:24:24,793
My brother Reginald DeCourcy.

369
00:24:24,918 --> 00:24:26,751
Hello.
Pleased to meet you.

370
00:24:26,876 --> 00:24:28,710
Good afternoon, Frederica.

371
00:24:28,835 --> 00:24:30,751
Good afternoon, Mother.

372
00:24:34,085 --> 00:24:37,626
It's as I've feared.
Excuse me. I must go to my daughter.

373
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,293
Poor Frederica.

374
00:24:43,418 --> 00:24:45,835
- Poor mother of Frederica.
- What?

375
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,793
The daughter is, I understand,

376
00:24:48,918 --> 00:24:51,668
- a troubled girl.
- How do you so fear?

377
00:24:53,418 --> 00:24:56,876
She hasn't had tea.
Could be a lack of nourishment.

378
00:25:14,585 --> 00:25:15,918
Where is Frederica?

379
00:25:16,043 --> 00:25:19,710
In her rooms,
practicing the pianoforte.

380
00:25:19,835 --> 00:25:21,793
She practices quietly.

381
00:25:21,918 --> 00:25:24,085
Don't look.
Frederica's watching us.

382
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:27,418
- Watching us?
- Through the window. Don't look.

383
00:25:27,543 --> 00:25:31,168
How odd to be spied upon.

384
00:25:31,293 --> 00:25:32,835
That's the parent's lot.

385
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,585
We bring these delightful
creatures into the world,

386
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:38,126
eagerly, happily,
and then, before long,

387
00:25:38,251 --> 00:25:41,626
they're spying upon and judging us,
rarely favorably.

388
00:25:41,751 --> 00:25:46,335
Having children is our fondest wish, but
in doing so, we breed our acutest critics..

389
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:50,460
It's a preposterous situation
but entirely of our own making.

390
00:25:50,585 --> 00:25:53,626
- I marvel at your good humor.
- Well, what alternative have we?

391
00:25:53,751 --> 00:25:56,835
It's the way of the world.
We must accept it with a smile.

392
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,960
Of course, when the little
ones are very small,

393
00:25:59,085 --> 00:26:01,835
there's a kind of sweetness
which partially compensates

394
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,918
for the dreadfulness which comes after.

395
00:26:04,043 --> 00:26:07,585
- You worry for Frederica's future?
- I worry for her present,

396
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:11,710
acknowledging that the responsibility
for securing her future rests with me.

397
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,835
** [woman singing opera]

398
00:26:33,835 --> 00:26:35,626
Go.

399
00:26:35,751 --> 00:26:37,668
[laughing] Come on.

400
00:26:47,751 --> 00:26:49,710
Pretty? You think so?

401
00:26:49,835 --> 00:26:51,543
Yes. You don't?

402
00:26:51,668 --> 00:26:53,626
No, I ought not to have said that.

403
00:26:53,751 --> 00:26:55,668
In any case, beauty matters little.

404
00:26:55,793 --> 00:27:00,585
It's vivacity and a lively intelligence
one looks for, even from the young.

405
00:27:13,418 --> 00:27:15,018
[laughing]

406
00:27:17,585 --> 00:27:20,382
Oh, I'm sorry.
Please excuse me.

407
00:27:20,507 --> 00:27:21,835
I beg your pardon.

408
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,585
- What is it, my dear?
- James: Miss Vernon!

409
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:24,751
He's here.

410
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:26,751
He is here.
Sir James is here.

411
00:27:26,876 --> 00:27:30,185
- Who?
- I'm so sorry. Please excuse me.

412
00:27:31,585 --> 00:27:33,126
James: Oh, Frederica!

413
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:35,293
Fre...

414
00:27:35,418 --> 00:27:37,126
Oh. Sorry
to come like this.

415
00:27:37,251 --> 00:27:39,793
I... I suppose you weren't expecting me.

416
00:27:39,918 --> 00:27:43,251
Sir James, allow me
to introduce my sister-in-law

417
00:27:43,376 --> 00:27:46,960
Mrs. Catherine Vernon and her brother
Mr. Reginald DeCourcy.

418
00:27:47,085 --> 00:27:49,251
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

419
00:27:51,126 --> 00:27:53,835
How kind of you to ask.
Uh, excellent.

420
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,293
Truly, very well.
Thank you.

421
00:27:56,418 --> 00:27:58,835
Uh, excuse my hurry in coming,

422
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,876
the lack of notice beforehand,
et cetera, et cetera.

423
00:28:02,001 --> 00:28:04,835
The truth is I forgot to write.

424
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,126
Then it was too late.
Now I'm here.

425
00:28:08,251 --> 00:28:12,168
Took the liberty of a relation,
hoping to be one soon.

426
00:28:13,585 --> 00:28:15,751
I must say, you look surprised.

427
00:28:15,876 --> 00:28:19,043
You were astonished
to see me, no? Not?

428
00:28:19,168 --> 00:28:20,585
That's how it looked.

429
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:23,168
Yes. I was astonished,
and I still am.

430
00:28:23,293 --> 00:28:28,335
Uh, an impressive establishment you
have here, sir. My congratulations.

431
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,793
Immaculate.

432
00:28:29,918 --> 00:28:32,085
Mr. DeCourcy is
Mrs. Vernon's brother.

433
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,335
Very good.

434
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:37,168
It's her husband Charles Vernon
who has Churchill.

435
00:28:37,293 --> 00:28:38,626
Churchill.

436
00:28:38,751 --> 00:28:41,626
That's how you say it.

437
00:28:41,751 --> 00:28:44,835
All together like that:
Churchill. Ha ha!

438
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,168
Oh, well, that explains a lot.

439
00:28:47,293 --> 00:28:51,626
You see, I'd heard "church" and "hill"
but couldn't find either.

440
00:28:51,751 --> 00:28:55,251
All I could see was this big house.
Ha ha!

441
00:28:55,376 --> 00:28:57,626
Fine name, Churchill.

442
00:28:57,751 --> 00:29:01,751
Marlborough, right? The general.
Showed the French.

443
00:29:01,876 --> 00:29:05,585
- You must be very proud.
- No connection.

444
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:08,835
But I believe I have
heard it spoken of.

445
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,460
I... I think you mentioned it.
Churchill.

446
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:18,335
Yes, I think you did.
But, again, I heard "church" and "hill,"

447
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,585
and I couldn't see either.

448
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:26,626
But I realized I was in mistake
and now stand corrected.

449
00:29:26,751 --> 00:29:29,335
Ah, happens
quite a lot. Ha ha!

450
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:32,585
Reginald, would you be so kind
as to take Sir James to see Charles?

451
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:34,918
I think you'll find
Charles very well versed

452
00:29:35,043 --> 00:29:38,918
in the advanced agricultural methods
in which you've taken such an interest.

453
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:43,001
Oh, yes. Advanced agricultural methods.
Very much so.

454
00:29:43,126 --> 00:29:47,293
Collins, who supervises Martindale
for me, speaks of them often.

455
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:51,668
A landowner of the current day
must know all sorts of things.

456
00:29:51,793 --> 00:29:53,626
That is our role.

457
00:29:53,751 --> 00:29:56,293
"Hello, Collins," I say.

458
00:29:56,418 --> 00:30:00,268
"What advanced agricultural methods
have we today?"

459
00:30:01,918 --> 00:30:03,518
Excellent.

460
00:30:05,585 --> 00:30:07,918
Oh. There you are.

461
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:10,810
Are you asleep?

462
00:30:12,418 --> 00:30:15,585
- No, Mama.
- Well, what, then?

463
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:17,418
You were hiding from me.

464
00:30:17,543 --> 00:30:19,210
Please explain.

465
00:30:19,335 --> 00:30:21,543
No.

466
00:30:21,668 --> 00:30:23,543
My strange girl.

467
00:30:25,335 --> 00:30:28,668
- What were you up to back there?
- What?

468
00:30:28,793 --> 00:30:31,418
Rushing out before Sir
James entered the room.

469
00:30:31,543 --> 00:30:33,001
I couldn't bear to see him.

470
00:30:33,126 --> 00:30:38,251
Couldn't bear.
Ungenerous manner of speech.

471
00:30:38,376 --> 00:30:40,126
Frederica, dear,

472
00:30:40,251 --> 00:30:42,668
Sir James Martin is
a kindhearted young man

473
00:30:42,793 --> 00:30:46,960
whose only offense seems to be wanting
to provide you with a life of comfort.

474
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,060
Have you nothing to say?

475
00:30:52,585 --> 00:30:55,335
Dear, our present comfortable state

476
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,668
is at the most precarious sort.

477
00:30:57,793 --> 00:31:00,543
We don't live.
We visit.

478
00:31:00,668 --> 00:31:03,460
We're entirely at the mercy of
our friends and relations,

479
00:31:03,585 --> 00:31:06,668
as we discovered
so painfully at Langford.

480
00:31:06,793 --> 00:31:10,460
Here, you seem to have won
your aunt's affections.

481
00:31:10,585 --> 00:31:13,626
I think I served you well there, for I
believe she'd do anything to spite me.

482
00:31:13,751 --> 00:31:15,918
But such a dynamic
cannot continue forever.

483
00:31:16,043 --> 00:31:18,293
- But Mama...
- But Mama.

484
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:21,918
I will not always be here
for you to contradict me.

485
00:31:22,043 --> 00:31:24,668
If a life of comfort
such as Sir James has to offer

486
00:31:24,793 --> 00:31:28,293
is not to your taste, what will you do?
How will you live?

487
00:31:28,418 --> 00:31:30,918
- I... I could teach.
- Teach.

488
00:31:31,043 --> 00:31:34,418
Had you been more in school,
you'd not consider such a thing.

489
00:31:34,543 --> 00:31:35,835
Answer this.

490
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,918
When our Lord wrote his commandments,

491
00:31:38,043 --> 00:31:42,377
which did he consider so important
that he put it in the fourth position?

492
00:31:42,502 --> 00:31:44,252
The fourth position?

493
00:31:44,377 --> 00:31:46,835
Yes, the fourth commandment.

494
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,252
I know the commandments,
but not their order.

495
00:31:50,377 --> 00:31:55,252
See? This is what comes of
an irregular education.

496
00:31:55,377 --> 00:31:57,335
Yes. Fourth commandment.

497
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:00,293
- Thou shalt not...
- No, it's not a shalt not.

498
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:02,252
- It's a shalt.
- A shalt?

499
00:32:02,377 --> 00:32:06,960
If I had not myself been present,
I would wonder if I were even your mother.

500
00:32:07,085 --> 00:32:10,043
"Honor thy father
and mother."

501
00:32:10,168 --> 00:32:13,585
I'm sorry, have I done anything
that's dishonored you or Father?

502
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:15,252
To honor means, among other things,

503
00:32:15,377 --> 00:32:18,085
to listen with respect
to a parent's sincere council.

504
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:21,002
I do listen with respect, Mama.
It's just that...

505
00:32:21,127 --> 00:32:24,585
If you will not pay attention to me, then
perhaps you will to a larger imperative.

506
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:26,918
The law of the universe.

507
00:32:27,043 --> 00:32:30,835
An offer as splendid as Sir James's
is not likely to come around again.

508
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,252
He has offered you the one
thing he has of value to give,

509
00:32:34,377 --> 00:32:36,502
his income.

510
00:32:36,627 --> 00:32:38,335
I fear and reproach myself

511
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,918
having shielded you for far too long.

512
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:43,335
Had I let you starve a little bit more,

513
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,335
you would resist much less.

514
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,460
Mama, I was often hungry at school.

515
00:32:47,585 --> 00:32:49,127
Well, evidently, not hungry enough.

516
00:32:49,252 --> 00:32:51,293
In any case, the starvation
at the schoolhouse

517
00:32:51,418 --> 00:32:54,710
is nothing like that of a destitute.
Is that what you want?

518
00:32:54,835 --> 00:32:56,877
No.

519
00:32:57,002 --> 00:32:59,127
I can see Sir James is a kind man,

520
00:32:59,252 --> 00:33:03,460
and if it weren't a matter of marriage,
I'm sure I could like him.

521
00:33:03,585 --> 00:33:05,627
But marriage is for one's whole life.

522
00:33:05,752 --> 00:33:07,460
Not in my experience.

523
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:10,585
Meanwhile, I must ask you not to speak
to your aunt and uncle about this matter,

524
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:13,460
or seek their interference in any way.

525
00:33:13,585 --> 00:33:16,793
I insist.
Promise?

526
00:33:16,918 --> 00:33:19,768
- Remember the commandment.
- Yes, Mama.

527
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:26,460
Sir James's arrival and suddenness

528
00:33:26,585 --> 00:33:28,335
requires some explanation.

529
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:30,668
You were not too surprised, I hope.

530
00:33:30,793 --> 00:33:32,460
It was unexpected.

531
00:33:32,585 --> 00:33:35,918
Certainly.
To me as much as anyone.

532
00:33:36,043 --> 00:33:39,835
I'm afraid Sir James's best qualities
are not immediately apparent.

533
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,627
- Certainly, he's no Solomon.
- Solomon?

534
00:33:42,752 --> 00:33:44,335
The wise king in The Bible

535
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:48,418
who had the idea of dividing the infant
disputed by two mothers in half.

536
00:33:48,543 --> 00:33:52,168
Or in two. I don't recall
the exact wording.

537
00:33:52,293 --> 00:33:55,627
- Yes, of course.
- So, Sir James is no Solomon.

538
00:33:55,752 --> 00:33:59,293
How many suitors of great wisdom could
a young woman expect to find these days?

539
00:33:59,418 --> 00:34:00,960
- I don't know.
- None.

540
00:34:01,085 --> 00:34:06,377
And, I confess, I ask myself is such
a quality even desirable in a husband?

541
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:10,293
[chuckling]
How jolly.

542
00:34:10,418 --> 00:34:12,018
Tiny green balls.

543
00:34:13,585 --> 00:34:17,252
Mm. Yes.
Good tasting.

544
00:34:17,377 --> 00:34:20,460
Quite sweet.
What are they called?

545
00:34:20,585 --> 00:34:21,752
Peas.

546
00:34:21,877 --> 00:34:23,918
Oh, yes.
No, I knew that.

547
00:34:24,043 --> 00:34:25,877
I recall now.

548
00:34:26,002 --> 00:34:29,585
I must get Collins to cultivate
these at Martindale.

549
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:33,460
Novelty vegetables.
Could make quite a packet.

550
00:34:33,585 --> 00:34:35,127
[laughs]

551
00:34:35,252 --> 00:34:37,168
Ohh. Tiny.

552
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:42,585
I'm enjoying Sir James's visit.

553
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:45,543
His conversation's lively.
Brings a new angle to things.

554
00:34:45,668 --> 00:34:48,085
What would you think, uh, to come
and see the Fredricksville Farm?

555
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:51,043
He mentioned he had an interest
in agricultural methods.

556
00:34:51,168 --> 00:34:52,768
Yes.

557
00:34:54,418 --> 00:34:58,585
- Frederick, be careful.
- Frederick, you must try to be good.

558
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:09,677
- He's utterly ridiculous.
- Certainly, he's no Solomon. But...

559
00:35:09,802 --> 00:35:12,710
- Solomon?
- The wise king from The Bible.

560
00:35:12,835 --> 00:35:14,835
I know he's not that.

561
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,918
But any man navigating the
cascades of romantic courtship,

562
00:35:18,043 --> 00:35:23,385
and occasionally falling into its foaming
waters is apt not to appear at his best.

563
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:26,377
- What?
- A simple word, Reginald.

564
00:35:26,502 --> 00:35:28,335
Comprehension.

565
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,877
I admire your caustic mind,

566
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:32,127
but I think you're
not entirely sensible

567
00:35:32,252 --> 00:35:34,252
at the degree to which
you can intimidate others.

568
00:35:34,377 --> 00:35:37,585
Particularly a young man over
whom you have every advantage of,

569
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:40,752
position, looks, and character.

570
00:35:40,877 --> 00:35:42,627
Sir James Martin
is a fool because of me.

571
00:35:42,752 --> 00:35:45,460
Yes. Around you,
he seems very silly.

572
00:35:45,585 --> 00:35:48,085
- Isn't he silly around everyone?
- No.

573
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:49,960
I believe he's given everyone
the same impression.

574
00:35:50,085 --> 00:35:53,127
Well, they've only seen him around you.

575
00:35:53,252 --> 00:35:55,335
But you deny Sir James's
intentions toward you.

576
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,918
- Toward me?
- He's clearly besotted with you.

577
00:35:58,043 --> 00:36:01,335
Oh, it's with Frederica he's smitten.

578
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:05,793
- That's not possible.
- Well, he's proposed to her.

579
00:36:05,918 --> 00:36:08,585
How could such a blockhead
even be allowed to court your daughter?

580
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,127
It's incomprehensible.

581
00:36:10,252 --> 00:36:13,543
This is the incomprehension
of the rich and easeful.

582
00:36:13,668 --> 00:36:16,752
You can afford to take the high ground,
and add another layer to your pride.

583
00:36:16,877 --> 00:36:19,585
If you realized the full
extent of ridiculous manhood

584
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:22,043
a young girl without
fortune must endure,

585
00:36:22,168 --> 00:36:24,252
you'd be more generous to Sir James.

586
00:36:31,418 --> 00:36:34,168
Lady Susan: It was so good
you could steal away.

587
00:36:34,293 --> 00:36:37,168
We can only meet through
such subterfuges.

588
00:36:37,293 --> 00:36:38,960
Mr. Johnson
is relentless.

589
00:36:39,085 --> 00:36:41,168
I'll not be sent back to Connecticut.

590
00:36:41,293 --> 00:36:43,793
I don't see why he believes
that association with me

591
00:36:43,918 --> 00:36:46,252
would lower your reputation.

592
00:36:46,377 --> 00:36:48,293
But a question.

593
00:36:48,418 --> 00:36:51,293
Did Sir James mention to you
any plans to come to Churchill?

594
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:53,835
Heavens no.
What folly.

595
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,585
How did Mr. DeCourcy
react?

596
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:58,252
Well, I had some gratification there.

597
00:36:58,377 --> 00:37:01,710
At first, he observed Sir James with
attention not untinged with jealousy,

598
00:37:01,835 --> 00:37:04,252
but it was impossible
to really torture him,

599
00:37:04,377 --> 00:37:07,585
for I had to finally reveal
that his object was Frederica.

600
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:10,060
Then he was all astonishment.

601
00:37:10,185 --> 00:37:11,164
Left to ourselves,

602
00:37:11,289 --> 00:37:14,043
I had no great difficulty
in convincing him I was justified.

603
00:37:14,168 --> 00:37:18,585
I don't remember the exact reasoning,
but it was all comfortably arranged.

604
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:21,460
So what's your verdict
on young DeCourcy?

605
00:37:21,585 --> 00:37:24,085
Well, he's not stupid, and
he has a great deal to say,

606
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:26,752
but I can't help but look
with a certain contempt

607
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:31,293
on the fancies of a heart so doubting
the reasonableness of it's own emotions.

608
00:37:31,418 --> 00:37:33,960
I vastly prefer the generous
spirit of a Manwaring

609
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,210
who deeply convinced of one's marriage

610
00:37:36,335 --> 00:37:39,627
can be satisfied that what
everyone does is right.

611
00:37:39,752 --> 00:37:45,043
I know that no one really deserves you,
but young DeCourcy might be worth having.

612
00:38:09,293 --> 00:38:12,252
Excuse me, Frederica.

613
00:38:12,377 --> 00:38:15,585
When I came down this morning, I...
I couldn't help but notice

614
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:18,585
you were reading a book.

615
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:21,918
Which book was that?

616
00:38:22,043 --> 00:38:25,127
This volume of Cooper's verse.

617
00:38:25,252 --> 00:38:29,585
Cooper the poet?
He... He also writes verse?

618
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:31,460
Most impressive.

619
00:38:31,585 --> 00:38:33,585
Yes, he's versatile in that way.

620
00:38:38,919 --> 00:38:44,127
So, Frederica, you read
both verse and poetry.

621
00:38:44,252 --> 00:38:48,460
In this, I believe,
you take after your mother,

622
00:38:48,585 --> 00:38:50,585
who knows a great many things.

623
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:54,627
Just yesterday, she cited to me
a story from The Bible

624
00:38:54,752 --> 00:38:57,460
about a very wise king.

625
00:38:57,585 --> 00:39:03,002
This reminded me of many such accounts
one learns in childhood.

626
00:39:03,127 --> 00:39:07,294
Perhaps most significant
in forming one's principles

627
00:39:07,419 --> 00:39:12,835
is that of the old prophet who came
down from the mount with tablets,

628
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,877
pleading the 12 commandments,

629
00:39:16,002 --> 00:39:21,169
which our Lord has taught us to obey
without fail.

630
00:39:21,294 --> 00:39:24,002
- 12 commandments.
- Mm.

631
00:39:24,127 --> 00:39:27,919
Excuse me but, uh,
I believe there were only 10.

632
00:39:30,585 --> 00:39:32,960
Really?

633
00:39:33,085 --> 00:39:35,252
Only 10 must be obeyed.
Excellent.

634
00:39:35,377 --> 00:39:40,585
[chuckles] Well, then,
wh... which two to take off?

635
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:44,252
Perhaps the one about the Sabbath.
I prefer to hunt.

636
00:39:44,377 --> 00:39:47,877
- Well...
- After that, it becomes tricky.

637
00:39:48,002 --> 00:39:51,585
Many of the thou shalt nots.
Don't murder.

638
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:54,710
Uh, don't covet
thy neighbor's house or wife.

639
00:39:54,835 --> 00:39:56,877
You... One simply
wouldn't do, anyway.

640
00:39:57,002 --> 00:39:59,794
[chuckles]
Because they are wrong.

641
00:39:59,919 --> 00:40:03,794
Whether the Lord allows us
to take them off or not.

642
00:40:09,335 --> 00:40:10,935
[chuckles]

643
00:40:16,627 --> 00:40:18,544
It's so kind of you.

644
00:40:18,669 --> 00:40:20,377
No, uh, delighted.

645
00:40:20,502 --> 00:40:23,502
Honored.
My... my pleasure.

646
00:40:23,627 --> 00:40:25,710
Would you like me to sign a note?

647
00:40:25,835 --> 00:40:27,502
Uh, no, no documents.

648
00:40:27,627 --> 00:40:29,585
Uh, no note necessary.

649
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:33,710
All in the family,
or hoping to be soon.

650
00:40:33,835 --> 00:40:36,377
And, uh...
and the carriage?

651
00:40:36,502 --> 00:40:40,252
Oh, yes. The carriage.
Definitely. Certainly.

652
00:40:40,377 --> 00:40:42,752
My pleasure.
Honored.

653
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:47,669
**

654
00:40:51,419 --> 00:40:53,585
[clapping]

655
00:41:45,585 --> 00:41:47,585
- Good day, Charles.
- Good day.

656
00:42:02,585 --> 00:42:05,460
Oh, hello.

657
00:42:05,585 --> 00:42:07,502
- Good day.
- Good day.

658
00:42:07,627 --> 00:42:10,335
Do you know where
I might find your mother?

659
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:12,585
I believe she has gone out.

660
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:14,310
Gone out?

661
00:42:16,585 --> 00:42:19,169
- Are you all right?
- Mm-hm.

662
00:42:19,294 --> 00:42:20,894
What is it?

663
00:42:22,752 --> 00:42:24,352
Tell me what's wrong.

664
00:42:28,252 --> 00:42:29,852
Please say.

665
00:42:32,169 --> 00:42:34,877
Sir, I...

666
00:42:35,002 --> 00:42:37,210
I do not know to whom I can apply.

667
00:42:37,335 --> 00:42:40,460
What is it?
Please tell me.

668
00:42:40,585 --> 00:42:43,210
I'm sorry, I shouldn't
have said anything.

669
00:42:43,335 --> 00:42:44,919
It's just that...

670
00:42:45,044 --> 00:42:47,585
You're the only one I think
Mother might listen to.

671
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:49,585
Why would you say that?

672
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:52,419
Well, she pays no one such regard as
she does you, except Lord Manwaring.

673
00:42:52,544 --> 00:42:54,836
- What do you mean, Manwaring?
- No.

674
00:42:54,961 --> 00:42:57,044
I'm sorry.

675
00:42:57,169 --> 00:42:58,960
It... It's just that

676
00:42:59,085 --> 00:43:02,085
of all the people, I thought
Mother would listen most to you.

677
00:43:05,252 --> 00:43:07,794
Let me understand this.

678
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:10,794
It's that you find
Sir James's presence,

679
00:43:10,919 --> 00:43:14,544
and courtship of you unwelcome.

680
00:43:14,669 --> 00:43:18,585
If his presence here disturbs you, it's
to Charles and my sister you should apply.

681
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:20,585
I promised Mother I would not.

682
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:24,210
I don't understand.
Why would you promise that?

683
00:43:24,335 --> 00:43:26,460
She required it.

684
00:43:26,585 --> 00:43:28,930
What does she require?

685
00:43:29,055 --> 00:43:31,127
What?

686
00:43:31,252 --> 00:43:33,585
These silences are vexing.

687
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:36,877
- Mama forbade it.
- I don't understand.

688
00:43:37,002 --> 00:43:39,127
I promised not to speak to my
aunt and uncle on this subject.

689
00:43:39,252 --> 00:43:41,252
- For what possible reason?
- It's wrong of me to speak now,

690
00:43:41,377 --> 00:43:44,460
and I'd not have
if I weren't at my wit's end.

691
00:43:44,585 --> 00:43:47,044
But I can't marry Sir James.

692
00:43:47,169 --> 00:43:48,794
To what do you object?

693
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:53,585
You must have noticed.

694
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:55,377
He's very silly.

695
00:43:55,502 --> 00:43:57,252
But besides that.

696
00:43:57,377 --> 00:43:58,835
Besides that?

697
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,127
Yes, I confess the first impression
he made on me was also...

698
00:44:02,252 --> 00:44:03,460
indifferent,

699
00:44:03,585 --> 00:44:05,919
but don't those
knowledgeable of such matters

700
00:44:06,044 --> 00:44:08,002
consider Sir James a good catch,

701
00:44:08,127 --> 00:44:10,835
or match or whatever it is they say?

702
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,210
A man of cheerful temperament,

703
00:44:13,335 --> 00:44:16,252
happy to devote a large
income to a wife's comfort.

704
00:44:16,377 --> 00:44:18,085
I would rather work for my bread.

705
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:20,210
But what could you do?

706
00:44:20,335 --> 00:44:21,544
I could teach.

707
00:44:21,669 --> 00:44:22,960
- Teach.
- I could...

708
00:44:23,085 --> 00:44:24,210
Yes.

709
00:44:24,335 --> 00:44:28,419
You must have been very little
in school to think that.

710
00:44:28,544 --> 00:44:30,877
Tell me, how did this happen?

711
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:32,919
Your mother is a woman
of excellent understanding.

712
00:44:33,044 --> 00:44:36,669
Her concern for you is great,
though wise and clear-eyed.

713
00:44:36,794 --> 00:44:41,252
How could she be as mistaken as you
suggest, if you truly despise Sir James?

714
00:44:41,377 --> 00:44:43,585
I don't despise Sir James.

715
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:46,460
I'm sure he's a kind man.

716
00:44:46,585 --> 00:44:48,460
And he has a...

717
00:44:48,585 --> 00:44:50,835
charm of a kind.

718
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,044
And certainly he is likable,

719
00:44:53,169 --> 00:44:57,460
and I'm sure I could like him if he
were a cousin or a cousin's cousin,

720
00:44:57,585 --> 00:45:02,585
or a friend or a friend's friend,
or an in-law or a step something.

721
00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:06,294
I just don't want to marry him.

722
00:45:06,419 --> 00:45:09,669
Come.
Tell me the particulars.

723
00:45:09,794 --> 00:45:11,669
If they are as you say,

724
00:45:11,794 --> 00:45:15,252
I can't for the world imagine your
mother would remain deaf to your wishes.

725
00:45:19,419 --> 00:45:21,019
Thank you.

726
00:45:27,086 --> 00:45:29,794
Catherine.
I'd like to thank you for this visit.

727
00:45:29,919 --> 00:45:32,002
- You're leaving?
- Yes, I must.

728
00:45:32,127 --> 00:45:33,252
Why?

729
00:45:33,377 --> 00:45:36,294
As you've said, it's important that this
season one of us be with our parents.

730
00:45:36,419 --> 00:45:37,669
You've just decided this now?

731
00:45:37,794 --> 00:45:41,836
Yes, but before going
I must ask one thing.

732
00:45:43,586 --> 00:45:46,502
I'd be grateful if you could see
justice is done Frederica.

733
00:45:46,627 --> 00:45:48,794
She's a sweet girl
who deserves a better fate.

734
00:45:48,919 --> 00:45:50,836
I'm glad you now see her worth.

735
00:45:50,961 --> 00:45:54,086
Yes. My eyes have opened
to many things.

736
00:46:02,461 --> 00:46:07,127
- Aunt, I did something very wrong.
- I'm sure not.

737
00:46:07,252 --> 00:46:10,752
No, I... I did. And now
he and my mother have quarreled.

738
00:46:10,877 --> 00:46:13,294
He's to leave and it is my fault.

739
00:46:13,419 --> 00:46:16,336
- Mama will never forgive me.
- Don't worry.

740
00:46:16,461 --> 00:46:19,769
If any of what you fear comes to pass,
I'll happily intercede.

741
00:46:33,627 --> 00:46:35,252
Good afternoon, Catherine.

742
00:46:35,377 --> 00:46:38,127
That cough of young
Frederick's worries me.

743
00:46:38,252 --> 00:46:40,752
I have from London some of Dr.
Preston's excellent lozenges.

744
00:46:40,877 --> 00:46:43,919
- Would you like them for the dear boy?
- Yes. Thank you.

745
00:46:44,044 --> 00:46:47,211
Also, is it true that we're losing Mr.
DeCourcy today?

746
00:46:47,336 --> 00:46:48,752
Yes, it seems that we will.

747
00:46:48,877 --> 00:46:50,627
How remarkable.

748
00:46:50,752 --> 00:46:55,794
When he and I spoke barely an hour ago,
he made no mention of it.

749
00:46:55,919 --> 00:46:58,169
But perhaps he did not
then know himself.

750
00:46:58,294 --> 00:47:01,127
Young men are so impetuous
in their resolutions.

751
00:47:01,252 --> 00:47:03,377
Why, I wouldn't say
Reginald's impetuous.

752
00:47:03,502 --> 00:47:06,586
Oh, yes, he is.
He's like other young men that way.

753
00:47:06,711 --> 00:47:10,461
Hasty in making resolutions,
and then just as quick to unmake them.

754
00:47:10,586 --> 00:47:13,294
I would not be surprised if he were to
change his mind and stay.

755
00:47:13,419 --> 00:47:15,461
He seemed quite decided.

756
00:47:15,586 --> 00:47:17,294
Well, we'll see.

757
00:47:17,419 --> 00:47:20,502
Some strangeness also seems
to be affecting Frederica.

758
00:47:20,627 --> 00:47:24,794
I believe the girl's actually fallen
in love. With your brother the object.

759
00:47:38,919 --> 00:47:42,294
Sir, Lady Susan asked if she
might have a word with you.

760
00:47:42,419 --> 00:47:46,794
She asked if you would be so kind
as to visit her in her dressing room.

761
00:47:59,377 --> 00:48:01,711
[knocking]

762
00:48:01,836 --> 00:48:03,436
Lady Susan:
Come in.

763
00:48:11,919 --> 00:48:13,836
I beg your pardon
for calling you here, sir,

764
00:48:13,961 --> 00:48:18,502
but I've just learned of
your intention to leave today.

765
00:48:18,627 --> 00:48:22,461
- Is that true?
- Yes, it is.

766
00:48:22,586 --> 00:48:24,186
May we close the door?

767
00:48:29,919 --> 00:48:34,586
I entreat you not, on my account,
to shorten your visit by even an hour.

768
00:48:34,711 --> 00:48:36,961
Well...

769
00:48:37,086 --> 00:48:41,086
I'm perfectly aware that after
what has passed between us,

770
00:48:41,211 --> 00:48:46,461
it will ill suit either of us
to remain in the same house.

771
00:48:46,586 --> 00:48:48,586
It is I who should go.

772
00:48:48,711 --> 00:48:50,627
No. Why?

773
00:48:50,752 --> 00:48:54,294
My visit has already been
inconvenient for your family.

774
00:48:54,419 --> 00:48:59,294
For me to stay risks dividing a clan
affectionately attached to one another.

775
00:48:59,419 --> 00:49:04,586
Where I go is of little consequence.
Whereas your presence is important to all.

776
00:49:17,377 --> 00:49:19,794
Lady Susan: It's terrifying how
close I came to destruction.

777
00:49:19,919 --> 00:49:23,627
It all started with Frederica,
in a grip of a madness of some kind,

778
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:25,961
entreating Reginald
to intercede on her behalf

779
00:49:26,086 --> 00:49:29,752
as if I were some kind of unkind mother
not wanting the best for her child.

780
00:49:29,877 --> 00:49:33,877
Next, Reginald paid a visit to my rooms
with an expression of the utmost solemnity

781
00:49:34,002 --> 00:49:35,961
to inform me of the impropriety

782
00:49:36,086 --> 00:49:38,586
of allowing Sir James
Martin to court Frederica.

783
00:49:38,711 --> 00:49:41,877
I tried to joke him out of it,
but he refused to be.

784
00:49:42,002 --> 00:49:43,627
Heavens, is he really so pompous?

785
00:49:43,752 --> 00:49:47,544
The pomposity, I assume.
It was his disloyalty, which outraged me.

786
00:49:47,669 --> 00:49:52,086
If he held me in true regard, he would not
believe such insinuations in my disfavor.

787
00:49:52,211 --> 00:49:56,336
A worthy lover should assume one has
unanswerable motives for all one does.

788
00:49:56,461 --> 00:49:58,502
Certainly.

789
00:49:58,627 --> 00:50:00,252
Scarcely an hour had gone by

790
00:50:00,377 --> 00:50:03,336
when I learned that Reginald
was leaving Churchill.

791
00:50:03,461 --> 00:50:04,752
Well, something had to be done.

792
00:50:04,877 --> 00:50:08,044
Condescension was necessary,
though I abhor it.

793
00:50:08,169 --> 00:50:11,377
I sent for Reginald. When he appeared,
he seemed astonished at the silence,

794
00:50:11,502 --> 00:50:14,544
and he seemed as though he
were half-fearing, half-wishing

795
00:50:14,669 --> 00:50:16,377
to be softened by what I might say.

796
00:50:16,502 --> 00:50:19,086
The outcome justifies some
portion of vanity, my dear,

797
00:50:19,211 --> 00:50:21,586
for the effect was no less
favorable than immediate.

798
00:50:21,711 --> 00:50:24,919
- You brilliant creature.
- So now I have many tasks.

799
00:50:25,044 --> 00:50:27,752
I must punish Frederica for
her application to Reginald,

800
00:50:27,877 --> 00:50:30,627
and punish him for
receiving it so favorably.

801
00:50:30,752 --> 00:50:32,377
And I must make myself serious amends

802
00:50:32,502 --> 00:50:34,877
for the humiliations
I've been obliged to undergo.

803
00:50:36,586 --> 00:50:38,127
Manwaring's in town.

804
00:50:38,252 --> 00:50:41,211
Manwaring.
How is he, the divine man?

805
00:50:41,336 --> 00:50:45,002
Absolutely miserable about you.
And jealous of DeCourcy.

806
00:50:45,127 --> 00:50:48,294
To such a degree I can't answer for his
not committing some great imprudence

807
00:50:48,419 --> 00:50:50,877
- such as following you to Churchill.
- Heavens.

808
00:50:51,002 --> 00:50:53,794
[chuckles] I think I've
dissuaded him from it.

809
00:50:53,919 --> 00:50:55,627
If you do follow my advice
and marry DeCourcy,

810
00:50:55,752 --> 00:50:58,877
it will be indispensable for you
to get Manwaring out of the way.

811
00:50:59,002 --> 00:51:00,836
Only you have the influence
to send him home.

812
00:51:00,961 --> 00:51:04,586
And by remaining in town, I'll be able
to reward a long penance at Churchill.

813
00:51:04,711 --> 00:51:05,627
[door opens]

814
00:51:05,752 --> 00:51:08,336
With a little wealth anticipation.

815
00:51:08,461 --> 00:51:12,627
Madam, Lord Manwaring has arrived,
and begs to be admitted.

816
00:51:12,752 --> 00:51:14,352
Please ask him to wait.

817
00:51:28,169 --> 00:51:29,711
Miss Vernon?

818
00:51:29,836 --> 00:51:32,086
It's so good to see you here.

819
00:51:32,211 --> 00:51:34,252
Might I help you?

820
00:51:34,377 --> 00:51:38,002
Yes. A friend was asking...

821
00:51:38,127 --> 00:51:42,127
how in accord with Christian teaching
the fourth commandment should be honored?

822
00:51:42,252 --> 00:51:47,002
The fourth commandment? Yes, remember
the Sabbath day to keep it holy.

823
00:51:47,127 --> 00:51:51,336
No, I meant the commandment
"Honor thy mother and father."

824
00:51:51,461 --> 00:51:53,961
The fifth commandment.
My favorite.

825
00:51:54,086 --> 00:51:56,711
It's the church of Rome
that has it as the fourth.

826
00:51:56,836 --> 00:51:59,752
Yes, the fifth commandment,
Honor thy father and thy mother

827
00:51:59,877 --> 00:52:05,252
that thy days may be long upon the land
which the Lord, thy God, giveth thee.

828
00:52:05,377 --> 00:52:07,336
Beautiful. Profound.

829
00:52:07,461 --> 00:52:12,211
I believe one should apply this
sentiment of gratitude and loyalty

830
00:52:12,336 --> 00:52:14,586
to every aspect of our lives.

831
00:52:14,711 --> 00:52:17,627
We're not born into a savage wilderness

832
00:52:17,752 --> 00:52:20,919
but into a beautiful mansion
of the Lord that

833
00:52:21,044 --> 00:52:25,461
the Lord and those who have
gone before us have constructed.

834
00:52:25,586 --> 00:52:30,461
We must avoid neglecting this mansion,
but rather glorify and preserve it.

835
00:52:30,586 --> 00:52:33,169
As we should all
of the Lord's creation.

836
00:52:33,294 --> 00:52:37,586
The superb Baumgarten has
outlined this aesthetic trinity

837
00:52:37,711 --> 00:52:41,336
as beauty, truth, and good.

838
00:52:41,461 --> 00:52:48,211
Truth is the perfect, perceived
by reason. Beauty by the senses.

839
00:52:48,336 --> 00:52:51,586
And the good by moral will.

840
00:53:06,419 --> 00:53:08,336
From where do you come?

841
00:53:08,461 --> 00:53:10,628
Church.

842
00:53:10,753 --> 00:53:13,378
Why were you in church?

843
00:53:13,503 --> 00:53:16,044
Well...

844
00:53:16,169 --> 00:53:17,794
It is our religion.

845
00:53:17,919 --> 00:53:22,044
Yes, but this time of day,
neither morning prayer nor vespers?

846
00:53:22,169 --> 00:53:25,378
The sky had clouded over.
I was sure there would be a downpour.

847
00:53:25,503 --> 00:53:27,669
There was.

848
00:53:27,794 --> 00:53:31,336
Oh, you are quite drenched!
You must get into some dry clothes!

849
00:53:31,461 --> 00:53:33,753
Oh, excuse me.

[ birds crowing ]

851
00:53:51,003 --> 00:53:53,128
Dearest, welcome.

852
00:53:53,253 --> 00:53:55,294
What joy your letter gave us.

853
00:53:55,419 --> 00:53:57,919
- I wrote too hastily.
- What?

854
00:53:58,044 --> 00:54:01,919
I couldn't imagine that every expectation
I had would be dashed so quickly.

855
00:54:02,044 --> 00:54:03,128
You frighten me.

856
00:54:03,253 --> 00:54:06,544
Poor girl. Her one
chance to break free.

857
00:54:06,669 --> 00:54:09,169
Who knows what punishment
her mother will now impose.

858
00:54:09,294 --> 00:54:12,586
But Reginald can't be blind
to such a lovely girl.

859
00:54:12,711 --> 00:54:14,169
He's become blind.

860
00:54:14,294 --> 00:54:18,253
Reginald is more securely
Lady Susan's than ever.

861
00:54:18,378 --> 00:54:23,378
Please don't tell your father.
I worry for his constitution.

862
00:54:23,503 --> 00:54:25,836
Tell me what?

863
00:54:46,128 --> 00:54:47,961
Susan, stop!

864
00:54:48,086 --> 00:54:50,711
Dreadful news.
Mr. Johnson's been cured.

865
00:54:50,836 --> 00:54:51,961
Oh, how is that possible?

866
00:54:52,086 --> 00:54:55,003
No sooner had he heard you were
in London then he had a cure.

867
00:54:55,128 --> 00:54:56,919
Well, then could you do
me the greatest favor?

868
00:54:57,044 --> 00:55:00,086
Could you go to Seymour Street
and receive Reginald there?

869
00:55:00,211 --> 00:55:02,461
I dare not risk his
and Manwaring's meeting.

870
00:55:02,586 --> 00:55:05,211
Keep him with you
all evening if you can.

871
00:55:05,336 --> 00:55:07,211
Make up anything.

872
00:55:36,753 --> 00:55:38,836
I'm sorry I wasn't there to greet you.

873
00:55:38,961 --> 00:55:43,669
But didn't I provide
a charming substitute?

874
00:55:43,794 --> 00:55:46,628
Strange, you remain silent

875
00:55:46,753 --> 00:55:49,586
but Mrs. Johnson couldn't
stop singing your praises.

876
00:55:49,711 --> 00:55:50,961
Excuse me?

877
00:55:51,086 --> 00:55:53,378
I fear Alicia's rather
fallen in love with you.

878
00:55:53,503 --> 00:55:55,586
It's given me quite a scare.

879
00:55:55,711 --> 00:55:58,086
You're joking.

880
00:55:58,211 --> 00:55:59,586
But you did like her.

881
00:55:59,711 --> 00:56:02,919
Of course.

882
00:56:03,044 --> 00:56:04,253
I so admire Alicia.

883
00:56:04,378 --> 00:56:08,378
She has none of the uncouthness
one expects from Americans

884
00:56:08,503 --> 00:56:10,461
but all of the candor.

885
00:56:10,586 --> 00:56:13,378
Her husband, Mr. Johnson, is
older and rather disagreeable.

886
00:56:13,503 --> 00:56:16,586
But a word of complaint never
drops from Alicia's lips.

887
00:56:16,711 --> 00:56:18,794
Exemplary.

888
00:56:18,919 --> 00:56:21,461
Only by one's friends can
one truly be known.

889
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:25,669
That Alicia is mine will, I hope,
help you think better of me.

890
00:56:25,794 --> 00:56:27,919
I already thought well of you.

891
00:56:28,044 --> 00:56:32,878
You are not plagued by doubt?

892
00:56:33,003 --> 00:56:35,586
Some things disconcerted me,
that you were not here...

893
00:56:35,711 --> 00:56:38,961
Please, Reginald, don't be severe.
I can't support reproaches.

894
00:56:39,086 --> 00:56:41,753
- But...
- No, I entreat you. I can't support them.

895
00:56:41,878 --> 00:56:46,586
My absence was to arrange a matter
so that we could be together.

896
00:56:46,711 --> 00:56:49,919
I'm forbidden to say more.
Please don't reproach me.

897
00:56:56,044 --> 00:56:58,294
Have you considered what I asked?

898
00:56:58,419 --> 00:57:02,211
I have, and I believe that
our affairs require a caution

899
00:57:02,336 --> 00:57:05,961
and delicacy that perhaps
in our candid enthusiasm,

900
00:57:06,086 --> 00:57:08,586
we might have insufficiently heeded.

901
00:57:08,711 --> 00:57:09,919
What do you mean?

902
00:57:10,044 --> 00:57:12,961
I fear that our feelings have
hurried us to a degree

903
00:57:13,086 --> 00:57:15,461
which is in ill accord with
the views of the world.

904
00:57:15,586 --> 00:57:17,294
I'm sure that in time...

905
00:57:17,419 --> 00:57:19,669
Perhaps with time, but...

906
00:57:19,794 --> 00:57:21,461
Given the poignancy or our feelings...

907
00:57:21,586 --> 00:57:22,836
You no longer wish to marry?

908
00:57:22,961 --> 00:57:25,961
No! No, all
I'm saying, or,

909
00:57:26,086 --> 00:57:28,169
or hesitantly suggesting
is that we postpone

910
00:57:28,294 --> 00:57:31,586
an open understanding until
the opinion of the world

911
00:57:31,711 --> 00:57:34,794
is more in accord with
our inclinations.

912
00:57:36,628 --> 00:57:39,586
- That could mean never.
- No, no.

913
00:57:39,711 --> 00:57:42,628
Perhaps... months.

914
00:57:42,753 --> 00:57:45,336
I confess that such delay is
against my every inclination.

915
00:57:45,461 --> 00:57:46,961
Then let's.

916
00:57:47,086 --> 00:57:51,586
No, Reginald, I will not be
responsible for dividing your family.

917
00:57:51,711 --> 00:57:54,003
I thought we'd decided.

918
00:57:54,128 --> 00:57:57,294
I know such delay is insupportable,

919
00:57:57,419 --> 00:57:59,544
especially when we're both in London.

920
00:57:59,669 --> 00:58:02,378
But separations, only those
that are also geographical

921
00:58:02,503 --> 00:58:05,294
can reasonably be tolerated.

922
00:58:05,419 --> 00:58:08,169
- What?
- I'm sorry, Reginald.

923
00:58:08,294 --> 00:58:11,294
Staying in London would be
the death of our reputations.

924
00:58:11,419 --> 00:58:14,086
We must not meet.

925
00:58:14,211 --> 00:58:18,086
And not to meet, we must not be near.

926
00:58:18,211 --> 00:58:22,253
As cruel as it may seem, the necessity
of it must be evident to you.

927
00:58:22,378 --> 00:58:24,044
Where will you go?

928
00:58:24,169 --> 00:58:26,211
Of course, it's necessary
that I remain in London.

929
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:30,794
There are arrangements that I
must make for us to be together.

930
00:58:30,919 --> 00:58:34,211
But on the contrary, I know
your family crave your company.

931
00:58:34,336 --> 00:58:38,586
Particularly that elderly gentleman
to whom you owe so much.

932
00:58:38,711 --> 00:58:43,461
I would hate to be the cause of an
<i>loignement</i> between you and your father.

933
00:58:43,586 --> 00:58:47,503
Who, forgive me,
might not have long left.

934
00:58:47,628 --> 00:58:50,586
There's no reason for
worry that I know of.

935
00:58:50,711 --> 00:58:53,586
- Father's rather in his prime.
- Oh, thank heavens.

936
00:58:53,711 --> 00:58:56,294
So he's not in decline.

937
00:58:56,419 --> 00:59:00,336
He has the usual aches and pains, but
he's overall, I believe, in good health.

938
00:59:00,461 --> 00:59:03,461
In any case, he'd not want
any concern on that account,

939
00:59:03,586 --> 00:59:06,961
- which he'd consider so much rubbish.
- Ah, mortality.

940
00:59:07,086 --> 00:59:10,378
Our mortality, and that of others,
but most particularly our own

941
00:59:10,503 --> 00:59:14,253
is the hardest and most intractable
hand life can deal us.

942

I long to meet the dear gentleman.

943
00:59:17,461 --> 00:59:21,586
Of course, it's natural that he
would want to ignore or minimize

944
00:59:21,711 --> 00:59:24,461
the cold, sad end that awaits us all.

945
00:59:24,586 --> 00:59:26,378
Not at all.
Father's a Christian

946
00:59:26,503 --> 00:59:29,753
for whom the prospect of the
end is neither sad nor cold.

947

Ah, yes. Well, thank heaven
for our religion.

So important in this life and
most especially in the next.

Yes, of course.

So kind of you to call.

Lady Susan's explained everything.

I am ashamed to have spoken as I did.
It was foolish of me.

No, no, no, not at all.
Most sympathetic.

969
01:00:45,586 --> 01:00:48,878
But you did not have to come to thank me.
Courtesy did not dictate it.

970

In fact, it's not my sole motive.

01:03:06,711 --> 01:03:09,461
I have no idea what she writes.
She's gone mad.

1015
01:03:09,586 --> 01:03:11,878
I'm sorry to say, my dear, that
I hear the Atlantic passage

1016
01:03:12,003 --> 01:03:15,795
is very cold this time of year.

1017
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:17,520
[ sobbing ]

1018
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:28,670
- Madam?
- Agonies, my dear.

1019
01:03:28,795 --> 01:03:30,920
- What's happened?
- The worst.

1020
01:03:31,045 --> 01:03:33,170
- Disaster.
- Disaster?

1021
01:03:33,295 --> 01:03:35,170
Mr. DeCourcy arrived
just when he shouldn't have.

1022
01:03:35,295 --> 01:03:39,461
Lucy Manwaring had just forced herself
into Mr. Johnson's study to sob her woes.

1023
01:03:39,586 --> 01:03:42,461
Oh, has she no pride?
No self-respect?

1024
01:03:42,586 --> 01:03:44,295
What an impression she makes.

1025
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:47,628
Bursting from Mr. Johnson's library,
wailing like a stuck child.

1026
01:03:47,753 --> 01:03:51,461
Seeing the letter in your handwriting,
she tore it from Reginald to read aloud.

1027
01:03:51,586 --> 01:03:52,836
- No!
- Yes.

1028
01:03:52,961 --> 01:03:55,253
"Manwaring comes
this very hour."

1029
01:03:55,378 --> 01:03:58,461
- And Reginald heard that?
- He read it himself.

1030
01:03:58,586 --> 01:04:01,461
How ungentlemanly.

1031
01:04:01,586 --> 01:04:05,211
- It's shocking. I can't believe it.
- Yes, very shocking.

1032
01:04:05,336 --> 01:04:08,586
A gentleman entrusted with
correspondence marked private

1033
01:04:08,711 --> 01:04:12,711
reads it regardless, and then because
of a few confidential remarks,

1034
01:04:12,836 --> 01:04:13,961
the obloquy's mine?

1035
01:04:14,086 --> 01:04:16,295
Who has acted badly in this affair?

1036
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:20,586
Only you and I stand innocent of
reading other people's correspondence.

1037
01:04:20,711 --> 01:04:23,003
Unluckily, Lady Manwaring
also wormed out

1038
01:04:23,128 --> 01:04:26,795
of her husband's servant that
Manwaring visited you in private.

1039
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:28,086
Oh.

1040
01:04:28,211 --> 01:04:31,336
Facts are horrid things.

1041
01:04:31,461 --> 01:04:34,753
Don't worry, I'll make my
story good with Reginald.

1042
01:04:34,878 --> 01:04:37,128
He'll be a little enraged at first,

1043
01:04:37,253 --> 01:04:39,920
but I vow that by dinner
tomorrow, all will be well.

1044
01:04:40,045 --> 01:04:42,961
I'm not sure, he was with
Mr. Johnson when I left.

1045
01:04:43,086 --> 01:04:45,211
Forgive me for saying it, but,

1046
01:04:45,336 --> 01:04:49,461
I dread to imagine what's
being said in your disfavor.

1047
01:04:49,586 --> 01:04:52,170
What a mistake you made
marrying Mr. Johnson.

1048
01:04:52,295 --> 01:04:56,795
Too old to be governable,
too young to die.

1049
01:05:15,711 --> 01:05:17,461
Good afternoon, madam.

1050
01:05:17,586 --> 01:05:20,961
Susan: Of course it might seem
outlandish or shocking to others,

1051
01:05:21,086 --> 01:05:24,045
but we're not expecting others
to read our correspondence.

1052
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:26,586
And don't put things for their benefit.

1053
01:05:26,711 --> 01:05:29,461
Manwaring only visited me
as his wife's friend.

1054
01:05:29,586 --> 01:05:31,586
Friend?
She herself denies this.

1055
01:05:31,711 --> 01:05:33,295
Well, of course.

1056
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:37,170
I was her friend when she was sane.
Her great enemy since.

1057
01:05:37,295 --> 01:05:41,086
Manwaring left Langford to
escape her deranged suspicions.

1058
01:05:41,211 --> 01:05:44,003
In granting him an interview,
my sole motive was

1059
01:05:44,128 --> 01:05:47,128
to persuade him to return to
her and see what might be done

1060
01:05:47,253 --> 01:05:51,461
- to ease the poor woman's mind.
- Yes, but why alone?

1061
01:05:51,586 --> 01:05:55,461
- Why did you arrange to see him alone?
- You cannot divine the motive there?

1062
01:05:55,586 --> 01:05:57,670
Servants have ears,

1063
01:05:57,795 --> 01:06:01,795
with the unfortunate tendency to repeat
whatever they imagine they've heard.

1064
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:05,253
I dreaded injuring the poor
woman's reputation still further.

1065
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:07,628
You imagine I could accept
such an explanation?

1066
01:06:07,753 --> 01:06:10,267
I can only tell you what
I know to be true.

1067
01:06:11,420 --> 01:06:14,586
- Did you succeed?
- What?

1068
01:06:14,711 --> 01:06:16,670
Did you convince Manwaring
to return to his wife?

1069
01:06:16,795 --> 01:06:18,545
Yes, I did.

1070
01:06:18,670 --> 01:06:23,503
But it seems that her judgment
is too deteriorated to allow it.

1071
01:06:23,628 --> 01:06:28,087
Her jealous and suspicious condition is
not one that would allow reassurance.

1072
01:06:28,212 --> 01:06:29,962
You forget.

1073
01:06:30,087 --> 01:06:31,962
I saw the letter with my own eyes.

1074
01:06:32,087 --> 01:06:34,837
No, I do not forget.
I greatly resent it.

1075
01:06:34,962 --> 01:06:38,462
A fault you compounded by misinterpreting
what you should never have seen.

1076
01:06:38,587 --> 01:06:42,087
Do you think I would have confided
a letter to a third party

1077
01:06:42,212 --> 01:06:45,587
if I thought its contents
in any way dangerous?

1078
01:06:45,712 --> 01:06:47,337
Have I not already explained
everything which

1079
01:06:47,462 --> 01:06:51,962
the ill-nature of the world
could interpret to my discredit?

1080
01:06:53,212 --> 01:06:57,295
What could so stagger your
esteem for me now?

1081
01:06:57,420 --> 01:06:59,753
After all we've discussed
and meant to one another,

1082
01:06:59,878 --> 01:07:04,045
that you could doubt my actions,
my intentions? My word?

1083
01:07:04,170 --> 01:07:06,962
Sorry, Reginald, but I've
reflected upon this deeply.

1084
01:07:07,087 --> 01:07:11,128
I cannot marry a man with an
untrusting disposition. I cannot have it.

1085
01:07:11,253 --> 01:07:12,462
What?

1086
01:07:12,587 --> 01:07:14,462
We cannot marry.

1087
01:07:14,587 --> 01:07:17,087
Whatever commitment
was between us is severed.

1088
01:07:17,212 --> 01:07:20,337
Any connection impossible.

1089
01:07:20,462 --> 01:07:22,003
What are you saying?

1090
01:07:22,128 --> 01:07:25,420
Mistrust does not bode well
for any union.

1091
01:07:25,545 --> 01:07:28,170
I have a great regard for you.

1092
01:07:28,295 --> 01:07:33,712
Yes, a passionate one,
but I must master it.

1093
01:07:51,378 --> 01:07:54,295
Oh, Catherine?
Catherine?

1094
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:56,462
- Reginald has returned.
- He's here?

1095
01:07:56,587 --> 01:07:59,462
- He's just going to find your father.
- It's not...

1096
01:07:59,587 --> 01:08:00,837
No, the most happy news.

1097
01:08:00,962 --> 01:08:03,462
- Our fears were in vain.
- What?

1098
01:08:03,587 --> 01:08:05,462
- The engagement's off.
- How?

1099
01:08:05,587 --> 01:08:07,795
Well, Lady Susan broke it off herself.

1100
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:09,295
She did?

1101
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:12,003
Reginald's most cast down.

1102
01:08:12,128 --> 01:08:15,212
But I'm sure he'll soon
recover and, dare we hope,

1103
01:08:15,337 --> 01:08:16,962
cast his look elsewhere.

1104
01:08:18,587 --> 01:08:20,462
That woman's a fiend.

1105
01:08:20,587 --> 01:08:22,753
- What do you mean?
- Lady Susan.

1106
01:08:22,878 --> 01:08:25,587
She has an uncanny understanding
of men's natures.

1107
01:08:25,712 --> 01:08:29,378
By forcing the rupture herself,
she's engaged Reginald's pride.

1108
01:08:29,503 --> 01:08:31,295
Uncanny? I don't understand.

1109
01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:34,753
Reginald will start to doubt everything
he's heard to her detriment.

1110
01:08:34,878 --> 01:08:37,087
A guilty regret will overwhelm him and

1111
01:08:37,212 --> 01:08:40,003
slowly, surely, he'll convince
himself he's wronged her.

1112
01:08:40,128 --> 01:08:41,170
You frighten me.

1113
01:08:41,295 --> 01:08:43,920
Yes, if Frederick Vernon,
renowned for his good sense,

1114
01:08:44,045 --> 01:08:46,795
let Lady Susan ruin him,
what chance has Reginald?

1115
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:49,128
You speak as if your brother
were not wise.

1116
01:08:49,253 --> 01:08:53,087
I'm sure he is. Everyone comments
on his lively understanding.

1117
01:08:53,212 --> 01:08:56,045
You are the best of mothers,

1118
01:08:56,170 --> 01:08:58,087
but Reginald has just
the sort of sincere nature

1119
01:08:58,212 --> 01:09:00,337
most vulnerable to
a woman of her genius.

1120
01:09:00,462 --> 01:09:01,878
You think she's a genius?

1121
01:09:02,003 --> 01:09:05,753
Diabolically so, like the
serpent in Eden's garden.

1122
01:09:06,962 --> 01:09:09,128
Does this woman always get her way?

1123
01:09:09,253 --> 01:09:11,587
From what I understand,
only clever tradesmen

1124
01:09:11,712 --> 01:09:14,170
are astute enough to see
through her stratagems.

1125
01:09:14,295 --> 01:09:18,587
Several banded together to send their
agents to intercept her on Seymour Street,

1126
01:09:18,712 --> 01:09:21,045
obliging her to pawn
the last of her jewels.

1127
01:09:21,170 --> 01:09:24,462
Slay the fatted calf, my dear,
the prodigal's returned.

1128
01:09:24,587 --> 01:09:25,753
What's wrong, my boy?

1129
01:09:25,878 --> 01:09:29,378
The joy of seeing your
aged parents eludes you.

1130
01:09:29,503 --> 01:09:31,726
- Don't tease him, father.
- It's a father's right.

1131
01:09:31,851 --> 01:09:35,587
- You'll have him fleeing back to London.
- No risk of that, I assure you.

1132
01:09:35,712 --> 01:09:38,462
London holds no charm for me.

1133
01:09:38,587 --> 01:09:40,253
Oh, you've realized that?
Good.

1134
01:09:40,378 --> 01:09:42,462
Never appealed to me at all.

1135
01:09:42,587 --> 01:09:46,587
Dirty, noisy, noxious gases.
Soot.

1136
01:09:46,712 --> 01:09:48,295
I don't see the point of towns.

1137
01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:50,920
Far better to live on one's own land.
Everyone should.

1138
01:09:51,045 --> 01:09:53,045
I'm afraid this relates
to my sister-in-law.

1139
01:09:53,170 --> 01:09:54,628
Yes, sister.

1140
01:09:54,753 --> 01:09:56,920
Congratulations on your
entire vindication.

1141
01:09:57,045 --> 01:09:59,337
On the contrary, I don't
seem out of danger at all.

1142
01:09:59,462 --> 01:10:01,837
- I assuredly am.
- What's the matter?

1143
01:10:01,962 --> 01:10:03,378
What's happened?
I don't understand.

1144
01:10:03,503 --> 01:10:06,795
Reginald, dear, Frederica
has prepared a charming piece.

1145
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:08,545
Help me persuade her to sing it for us.

1146
01:10:08,670 --> 01:10:11,420
No, you are too kind, Lady DeCourcy.
I am not ready.

1147
01:10:11,545 --> 01:10:13,295
Excuse me, Miss Vernon.

1148
01:10:13,420 --> 01:10:18,253
Mother, as much as I'd like to, I'm afraid
I'm too tired to be a suitable audience.

1149
01:10:18,378 --> 01:10:20,337
If you'll excuse me.

1150
01:10:20,462 --> 01:10:24,087
No, you must stay. Frederica's a
song-bird. Never heard anything like it.

1151
01:10:24,212 --> 01:10:27,587
Don't deny us this pleasure, my dear.
Reginald, we need you to insist.

1152
01:10:27,712 --> 01:10:30,962
- As I said...
- No, I'm sorry. Excuse me.

1153
01:10:31,087 --> 01:10:33,420
You must play it, my dear.
Please.

1154
01:10:33,545 --> 01:10:35,378
The Kentish Nightingale, I call her.

1155
01:10:35,503 --> 01:10:37,462
Voice is remarkable,
even to my hearing.

1156
01:10:37,587 --> 01:10:39,253
She must have it
from her mother's side.

1157
01:10:39,378 --> 01:10:43,420
Lady Susan's voice is a clear,
natural soprano, lovely.

1158
01:10:43,545 --> 01:10:45,003
Beautiful.

1159
01:10:45,128 --> 01:10:46,628
- [ horses approaching ]
- It is, is it?

1160
01:10:46,753 --> 01:10:50,795
- Do you expect visitors, mother?
- No. Who would visit us?

1161
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:54,545
Look who's come from London?
What an agreeable surprise.

1162
01:10:54,670 --> 01:10:57,003
Excuse me for arriving this way.

1163
01:10:57,128 --> 01:10:59,587
What a delightful family pose.

1164
01:10:59,712 --> 01:11:01,712
Yes, it is the season
for families to unite.

1165
01:11:01,837 --> 01:11:03,378
So it's especially welcome
to have you here.

1166
01:11:03,503 --> 01:11:04,837
Thank you, Charles.

1167
01:11:04,962 --> 01:11:07,795
I do hope that recognizing
a mother's anxiety

1168
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:10,878
to see her child, you might
excuse my abruptness.

1169
01:11:11,003 --> 01:11:13,420
Nothing to excuse.
Sir Reginald, Lady DeCourcy,

1170
01:11:13,545 --> 01:11:16,587
might I introduce my
sister-in-law, Lady Susan Vernon.

1171
01:11:16,712 --> 01:11:19,837
Enchant.
Please, forgive this intrusion.

1172
01:11:19,962 --> 01:11:22,712
Now that I'm fixed in town, I
can't rest with Frederica away.

1173
01:11:22,837 --> 01:11:26,128
- Isn't such anxiety new?
- Yes, it is, I entirely agree.

1174
01:11:26,253 --> 01:11:29,628
But now I'm in London where the
instruction Frederica needs

1175
01:11:29,753 --> 01:11:31,670
can so readily be found.

1176
01:11:31,795 --> 01:11:33,462
Her voice has some promise.

1177
01:11:33,587 --> 01:11:37,587
Some? She's a veritable songbird.
The Kentish Nightingale, I call her.

1178
01:11:37,712 --> 01:11:40,337
Do you?
Is this really Kent?

1179
01:11:40,462 --> 01:11:42,128
Delightful.

1180
01:11:42,253 --> 01:11:44,587
You're right sir, Frederica
has the native talent

1181
01:11:44,712 --> 01:11:48,878
a bird might, but those few
notes can get repetitive.

1182
01:11:50,420 --> 01:11:52,795
But mama, couldn't I stay?

1183
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:56,378
But mama, couldn't I stay?

1184
01:11:56,503 --> 01:11:57,795
Charming.

1185
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:02,295
I thank you, dear sister, for making
Frederica feel so at home and welcome

1186
01:12:02,420 --> 01:12:03,920
wherever she goes.

1187
01:12:04,045 --> 01:12:07,212
I've secured you a lesson
with Signor Valtroni.

1188
01:12:07,337 --> 01:12:09,837
Where the grand affair
of education is concerned,

1189
01:12:09,962 --> 01:12:12,670
there's no excuse
for half-measures.

1190
01:12:12,795 --> 01:12:16,628
Isn't it key, sir,
to cultivate her voice?

1191
01:12:16,753 --> 01:12:20,795
- A nightingale, didn't you say?
- Yes, that's right.

1192
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:23,337
The Kentish Nightingale, I call her.

1193
01:12:23,462 --> 01:12:27,170
Delightful appellation, and perhaps,
with a teacher such as Signor Valtroni,

1194
01:12:27,295 --> 01:12:29,337
it could even become true.

1195
01:12:29,462 --> 01:12:32,295
- Frederica, have you your things?
- Leave for London now?

1196
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:34,337
We'd so looked forward to
having Frederica with us.

1197
01:12:34,462 --> 01:12:35,962
How remarkable.

1198
01:12:36,087 --> 01:12:39,462
Only a few weeks ago it was hard
to find anywhere for Frederica.

1199
01:12:39,587 --> 01:12:41,587
Now the world fights for her company.

1200
01:12:41,712 --> 01:12:43,128
Astonishing.

1201
01:12:43,253 --> 01:12:46,337
Astonishing that she was neglected
then, or is fought over now?

1202
01:12:46,462 --> 01:12:50,170
Excellent observation, dear sister,
but I will stop now,

1203
01:12:50,295 --> 01:12:53,587
because I know how my daughter
hates to be praised.

1204
01:12:54,628 --> 01:12:58,003
How are you, sir?
I hope well.

1205
01:12:58,128 --> 01:12:59,670
We should go.

1206
01:12:59,795 --> 01:13:02,045
Excuse me, mama.
I must collect my things.

1207
01:13:02,170 --> 01:13:03,753
Yes, you must.

1208
01:13:03,878 --> 01:13:06,795
We cannot buy a new wardrobe
for each displacement.

1209
01:13:10,212 --> 01:13:13,303
That poor girl.
Did you see her face?

1210
01:13:13,428 --> 01:13:15,883
I must talk to her and remind her that
she will always have a home with us.

1211
01:13:16,008 --> 01:13:16,962
Or with us.

1212
01:13:17,087 --> 01:13:19,087
If you are referring to the past,

1213
01:13:19,212 --> 01:13:22,503
I doubt her mother will
again risk misinterpretation.

1214
01:13:22,628 --> 01:13:25,837
Henceforth, we can rest assured that
Lady Susan will make clear to Frederica

1215
01:13:25,962 --> 01:13:30,087
the consideration and affection
which guide her actions.

1216
01:13:42,212 --> 01:13:43,962
I have not gone to
the trouble of retrieving

1217
01:13:44,087 --> 01:13:46,587
Frederica from Parklands
to again be thwarted.

1218
01:13:46,712 --> 01:13:51,337
Maria Manwaring may sob, Frederica may
whimper, and the Vernons may storm,

1219
01:13:51,462 --> 01:13:53,837
but Sir James will be Frederica's
husband before the winter is out.

1220
01:13:53,962 --> 01:13:57,670
- You brilliant creature.
- Thank you, my dear.

1221
01:13:57,795 --> 01:14:00,629
I am done submitting my will
to the caprices of others.

1222
01:14:00,754 --> 01:14:03,337
Of resigning my own
judgment and deference

1223
01:14:03,462 --> 01:14:07,045
to those to whom I owe no duty
and have very little respect.

1224
01:14:07,170 --> 01:14:10,254
Too easily have I
let my resolve weaken.

1225
01:14:10,379 --> 01:14:12,295
Frederica shall know the difference.

1226
01:14:12,420 --> 01:14:14,170
You're too indulgent with the girl.

1227
01:14:14,295 --> 01:14:17,295
Why let Frederica have him when
you could grab him yourself?

1228
01:14:17,420 --> 01:14:19,004
Sir James?

1229
01:14:19,129 --> 01:14:20,962
Yes, I know your unselfish nature,

1230
01:14:21,087 --> 01:14:23,795
but can you afford to bestow
Sir James on Frederica

1231
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:26,045
while having no Sir James of your own?

1232
01:14:27,420 --> 01:14:30,587
Madam, Mr. Johnson sends word
he returns to dine.

1233
01:14:30,712 --> 01:14:32,045
Thank you.

1234
01:14:32,170 --> 01:14:34,545
- How insulting.
- The opposite.

1235
01:14:34,670 --> 01:14:37,754
I don't doubt your ability to get
DeCourcy whenever you want him.

1236
01:14:37,879 --> 01:14:39,920
But is he really worth having?

1237
01:14:40,045 --> 01:14:44,754
Isn't his father just the sort of
enraging old man who will live forever?

1238
01:14:44,879 --> 01:14:46,504
And how will you survive?

1239
01:14:46,629 --> 01:14:49,379
On the allowance that Frederica
as Lady Martin might grant you?

1240
01:14:49,504 --> 01:14:51,629
As guests at Churchill?

1241
01:14:51,754 --> 01:14:53,170
I'd rather be married to my own husband

1242
01:14:53,295 --> 01:14:55,712
than dependent on the
hospitality of others.

1243
01:14:59,170 --> 01:15:03,254
We must protect her. Not just for her
own sake, but for her dear late father's.

1244
01:15:03,379 --> 01:15:05,129
What can we do?

1245
01:15:05,254 --> 01:15:09,989
We must find the argument to persuade
her mother it's in her best interest,

1246
01:15:10,114 --> 01:15:12,670
which, of course, is her only guide.

1247
01:15:12,795 --> 01:15:14,629
That will mean a trip to London.

1248
01:15:14,754 --> 01:15:18,962
Fortunately, Charles must have some
business there to justify such a trip.

1249
01:15:19,087 --> 01:15:21,379
What a marvelous husband
you have, my dear.

1250
01:15:21,504 --> 01:15:24,170
Charles seems to live to oblige.

1251
01:15:24,295 --> 01:15:27,087
It's true.
I've been lucky.

1252
01:15:27,212 --> 01:15:31,354
Charles always seems to have some pretext
or other for doing just what's wanted.

1253
01:15:33,004 --> 01:15:35,129
[ humming ]

1254
01:15:35,254 --> 01:15:38,379
Dearest, I believe you have
pressing business in London.

1255
01:15:38,504 --> 01:15:41,879
Oh, um, yes.

1256
01:15:42,004 --> 01:15:44,670
Frederica?

1257
01:15:44,795 --> 01:15:46,754
You're so kind to visit.

1258
01:15:46,879 --> 01:15:48,804
Frederica will be delighted.

1259
01:15:48,929 --> 01:15:51,586
And how are the children?
Especially my dear Frederick.

1260
01:15:51,711 --> 01:15:53,504
Very well, thank you.

1261
01:15:53,629 --> 01:15:55,170
Frederica, come and see who's here.

1262
01:15:55,295 --> 01:15:59,045
I can't express my gratitude for
the hospitality you've extended us.

1263
01:15:59,170 --> 01:16:00,712
Not at all.
Our great pleasure.

1264
01:16:00,837 --> 01:16:02,709
- Hello, Frederica.
- Good afternoon, my dear.

1265
01:16:02,834 --> 01:16:05,462
- Hope you're well.
- Thank you.

1266
01:16:05,587 --> 01:16:08,254
Oh, it's so good to see you.

1267
01:16:08,379 --> 01:16:10,587
Frederica, why don't you
go upstairs and play a piece?

1268
01:16:10,712 --> 01:16:14,254
Select something charming to show your
aunt and uncle what you've studied.

1269
01:16:14,379 --> 01:16:16,670
With pleasure.

1270
01:16:18,587 --> 01:16:20,629
You'll see the strides
she's been making.

1271
01:16:20,754 --> 01:16:22,337
Oh, do mind your head.

1272
01:16:22,462 --> 01:16:24,379
Frederica plays all the new music.

1273
01:16:24,504 --> 01:16:27,295
Haydn, Himmel.
Bernadini.

1274
01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:28,837
Carabini.

1275
01:16:28,962 --> 01:16:30,795
Do sit down.

1276
01:16:32,379 --> 01:16:35,462
So you're happy with
the progress she's making?

1277
01:16:35,587 --> 01:16:37,462
Yes.

1278
01:16:37,587 --> 01:16:42,129
Only in a city such as London, I believe,
could she have had such instruction.

1279
01:16:42,254 --> 01:16:44,420
Well, if Frederica is making
such good progress in London,

1280
01:16:44,545 --> 01:16:46,795
that complicates matters.

1281
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:48,795
What complication would that be?

1282
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:51,295
We'd hoped that Frederica
might return to Churchill.

1283
01:16:51,420 --> 01:16:53,587
She's greatly missed,
especially by the little ones.

1284
01:16:53,712 --> 01:16:57,587
Oh, what a moving sentiment
of cousinly regard.

1285
01:16:57,712 --> 01:17:01,129
But my concern, my obligation,

1286
01:17:01,254 --> 01:17:04,129
is to see the defects in
Frederica's education repaired.

1287
01:17:04,254 --> 01:17:08,212
Could we invite one of her teachers to
Churchill to continue her lessons there?

1288
01:17:08,337 --> 01:17:09,587
What a kind thought.

1289
01:17:09,712 --> 01:17:12,587
But these are London's
most sought after Masters.

1290
01:17:12,712 --> 01:17:15,170
No invitation to a country retreat,

1291
01:17:15,295 --> 01:17:19,129
even such a delightful one as Churchill,
would be in their power to accept.

1292
01:17:19,254 --> 01:17:20,837
Perhaps a private tutor.

1293
01:17:20,962 --> 01:17:22,962
Might I confess something?

1294
01:17:23,087 --> 01:17:25,295
Frederica and I have become
such great friends,

1295
01:17:25,420 --> 01:17:27,379
it would be hard for
me to part with her.

1296
01:17:27,504 --> 01:17:29,920
You might have noticed
for a time there was a...

1297
01:17:30,045 --> 01:17:32,587
strange tension between us.

1298
01:17:32,712 --> 01:17:34,712
That is now happily disappeared.

1299
01:17:36,587 --> 01:17:37,962
Excuse me, are you well?

1300
01:17:38,087 --> 01:17:43,087
Sorry, we so set our hearts
on Frederica's return.

1301
01:17:43,212 --> 01:17:46,462
I understand completely.
She's become an agreeable companion.

1302
01:17:46,587 --> 01:17:51,504
Even her tendency to extreme quiet
I've grown to find rather soothing.

1303
01:17:51,629 --> 01:17:54,212
But there is one
factor that concerns me.

1304
01:17:54,337 --> 01:17:56,462
Does she look quite well?

1305
01:17:56,587 --> 01:17:58,462
- Oh, yes.
- That was your impression.

1306
01:17:58,587 --> 01:18:03,545
London's vaporous air is not, I think,
healthy for her.

1307
01:18:03,670 --> 01:18:05,754
- Does she not seem pale?
- She does.

1308
01:18:05,879 --> 01:18:11,170
The London air, these smoky gasses
cannot be salutary for her.

1309
01:18:11,295 --> 01:18:14,587
Fresh country air is
what the young require.

1310
01:18:14,712 --> 01:18:17,254
Yes, how curious they are.

1311
01:18:17,379 --> 01:18:22,504
Does not the town's dank air
favor the spread of influenza?

1312
01:18:22,629 --> 01:18:23,920
The influenza in London?

1313
01:18:24,045 --> 01:18:27,087
Several cases have been reported.
It is, after all, the season for it.

1314
01:18:27,212 --> 01:18:29,920
Of all the disorders in the world,

1315
01:18:30,045 --> 01:18:32,462
the risk of influenza contagion
is the one I dread the most

1316
01:18:32,587 --> 01:18:34,170
for Frederica's constitution.

1317
01:18:34,295 --> 01:18:36,962
Shouldn't we consider, then,
removing her from this danger?

1318
01:18:37,087 --> 01:18:39,462
What you say does give me pause.

1319
01:18:39,587 --> 01:18:43,045
But it would be such a hardship to
lose my daughter's companionship

1320
01:18:43,170 --> 01:18:46,462
just when I've grown to rely on it.

1321
01:18:46,587 --> 01:18:48,629
And, of course, her studies.

1322
01:19:03,629 --> 01:19:04,462
[ sighs ]

1323
01:19:04,587 --> 01:19:06,295
Congratulate me, my dear.

1324
01:19:06,420 --> 01:19:08,587
Frederica's aunt and uncle have
taken her back to Churchill.

1325
01:19:08,712 --> 01:19:12,254
I thought you'd grown to
enjoy Frederica's company so.

1326
01:19:12,379 --> 01:19:14,587
Comparatively. A bit.

1327
01:19:14,712 --> 01:19:19,420
But I'm not so self-indulgent as to want
to wallow in the companionship of a child.

1328
01:19:19,545 --> 01:19:22,462
Alas, I fear this is our last meeting.

1329
01:19:22,587 --> 01:19:24,504
At least while
Mr. Johnson is alive.

1330
01:19:24,629 --> 01:19:26,795
His business at Hartford
has become extensive.

1331
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:30,129
If I continue to see you, he vows
to settle in Connecticut forever.

1332
01:19:30,254 --> 01:19:32,754
Oh, you could be scalped!

1333
01:19:35,170 --> 01:19:39,087
I had a feeling that the great word
"respectable" would some day divide us.

1334
01:19:39,212 --> 01:19:42,337
Your husband, I abhor, but
we must yield to necessity.

1335
01:19:42,462 --> 01:19:44,379
Our affection cannot be impaired by it,

1336
01:19:44,504 --> 01:19:49,254
and in happier times when your
situation is as independent as mine,

1337
01:19:49,379 --> 01:19:50,837
we will again unite.

1338
01:19:50,962 --> 01:19:54,087
For this, I will impatiently await.

1339
01:19:54,212 --> 01:19:56,212
I also.

1340
01:19:56,337 --> 01:19:59,462
May Mr. Johnson's next gouty
attack end more favorably.

1341
01:19:59,587 --> 01:20:01,587

[ chattering ]

1343
01:20:40,337 --> 01:20:41,937
Thank you.

1344
01:20:49,754 --> 01:20:53,296
Do you know where Frederica is?
Lady Susan's written to her.

1345
01:20:53,421 --> 01:20:55,046
Oh.

1346
01:20:55,171 --> 01:20:57,296
Frederica?

1347
01:20:57,421 --> 01:21:00,629
Frederica, a letter from your mother.

1348
01:21:00,754 --> 01:21:03,254
Thank you, Aunt Catherine.
What does she say?

1349
01:21:03,379 --> 01:21:05,587
She's written to you herself.

1350
01:21:20,046 --> 01:21:24,129
My mother and
Sir James Martin have wed.

1351
01:21:24,254 --> 01:21:26,004
What?
How could that happen?

1352
01:21:26,129 --> 01:21:27,921
How could they possibly marry?

1353
01:21:28,046 --> 01:21:29,629
To what do you refer?
Both were free to do so.

1354
01:21:29,754 --> 01:21:31,379
He a bachelor, Susan a widow.

1355
01:21:31,504 --> 01:21:33,296
Sir James Martin is a fool.

1356
01:21:33,421 --> 01:21:35,171
Well, a bit of a rattle, perhaps.

1357
01:21:35,296 --> 01:21:38,004
A bit of a rattle?
He's a complete blockhead.

1358
01:21:38,129 --> 01:21:41,462
Well, there are three possible
explanations as I see it.

1359
01:21:41,587 --> 01:21:44,962
First, perhaps Sir James has
more merit than we've allowed.

1360
01:21:45,087 --> 01:21:46,504
No.

1361
01:21:46,629 --> 01:21:49,254
Well, second, perhaps in order
to secure your future, Frederica

1362
01:21:49,379 --> 01:21:52,254
your mother found it necessary
to make a prudent match herself.

1363
01:21:52,379 --> 01:21:53,629
That could be the case.

1364
01:21:53,754 --> 01:21:56,087
Mama has always been
concerned with my future.

1365
01:21:56,212 --> 01:21:58,171
And the third possible explanation?

1366
01:21:58,296 --> 01:22:00,212
That she came to love him.

1367
01:22:00,337 --> 01:22:04,087
There is a saying:
"the heart has its strangeness"

1368
01:22:04,212 --> 01:22:05,796
or words to that effect.

1369
01:22:05,921 --> 01:22:09,462
The heart is an instrument we
possess but do not truly know.

1370
01:22:09,587 --> 01:22:13,671
Human love partakes of the divine,
or at least it has in my case.

1371
01:22:15,379 --> 01:22:17,296
You'll find it in
the writings of Rousseau.

1372
01:22:17,421 --> 01:22:19,962
Julie.
Or The New Heloise, I think.

1373
01:22:20,087 --> 01:22:21,587
I'll will confirm the citation,
if you're interested.

1374
01:22:21,712 --> 01:22:26,129
I just find it incomprehensible that so
brilliant a woman could marry such a...

1375
01:22:26,254 --> 01:22:29,004
pea brain.
Or peas brain.

1376
01:22:29,129 --> 01:22:31,254
- It happens all the time.
- It strains credulity.

1377
01:22:31,379 --> 01:22:33,462
Certainly, as you said,
Sir James is no Solomon.

1378
01:22:33,587 --> 01:22:36,754
But if she can give Lady Susan
the happiness and security

1379
01:22:36,879 --> 01:22:38,921
which the sad events of
recent years deprived her of,

1380
01:22:39,046 --> 01:22:42,296
then he is someone that I,
and all of us, should value.

1381
01:22:42,421 --> 01:22:45,962
I very much agree, Uncle.
We all should.

1382
01:22:46,087 --> 01:22:49,962
I wish them every happiness
in their life together.

1383
01:23:06,212 --> 01:23:10,129
Congratulations, sir,
on the match I long favored.

1384
01:23:10,254 --> 01:23:12,087
There's a rightness to
your being together.

1385
01:23:12,212 --> 01:23:14,837
Not that any man could
really deserve Lady Susan.

1386
01:23:14,962 --> 01:23:17,462
I agree most heartily.

1387
01:23:17,587 --> 01:23:21,462
And I've pleasure is adding double
congratulations are in order.

1388
01:23:21,587 --> 01:23:23,046
What?

1389
01:23:23,171 --> 01:23:26,087
The most beautiful woman in
England, present company excepted,

1390
01:23:26,212 --> 01:23:29,962
will soon be the most beautiful mother.

1391
01:23:30,087 --> 01:23:32,171
Yes, I'm to be a father.

1392
01:23:32,296 --> 01:23:33,837
Marvelous.

1393
01:23:33,962 --> 01:23:36,962
You certainly don't delay matters.
Congratulations, sir.

1394
01:23:37,087 --> 01:23:39,379
Yes, the very morning
after the wedding,

1395
01:23:39,504 --> 01:23:43,587
Lady Susan hinted at the happy news
which was shortly confirmed.

1396
01:23:43,712 --> 01:23:45,171
Truly marvelous.

1397
01:23:45,296 --> 01:23:47,962
I'm as proud as you can imagine.

1398
01:23:48,087 --> 01:23:50,129
[ sobbing ]

1399
01:23:50,254 --> 01:23:51,854
What's that?

1400
01:23:54,254 --> 01:23:57,462
Such a burden.

1401
01:23:57,587 --> 01:23:59,212
When Lord and Lady Manwaring separated,

1402
01:23:59,337 --> 01:24:03,879
Mr. Johnson, who is Lucy Manwaring's
guardian, invited her to live with us.

1403
01:24:04,004 --> 01:24:06,671
Really?
What upsets her?

1404
01:24:06,796 --> 01:24:08,462
The separation, still.

1405
01:24:08,587 --> 01:24:10,129
- She goes on about it.
- What?

1406
01:24:10,254 --> 01:24:14,462
This carrying on about a
marriage that ended weeks ago.

1407
01:24:14,587 --> 01:24:16,129
If a woman fails to please her husband,

1408
01:24:16,254 --> 01:24:19,087
why go on about it,
advertising one's failure?

1409
01:24:19,212 --> 01:24:21,379
Why announce to the world
that the man who knows you best

1410
01:24:21,504 --> 01:24:23,171
would rather be with someone else?

1411
01:24:23,296 --> 01:24:25,296
It seems as if
Lady Manwaring has failed

1412
01:24:25,421 --> 01:24:28,087
to consider the difference
between the sexes.

1413
01:24:28,212 --> 01:24:31,462
For a husband to wander
is not the same as vice versa.

1414
01:24:31,587 --> 01:24:36,296
If a husband strays, he's merely
responding to his biology.

1415
01:24:36,421 --> 01:24:38,296
That is how men are made.

1416
01:24:38,421 --> 01:24:42,296
But for a woman to act
in a similar way is ridiculous.

1417
01:24:42,421 --> 01:24:44,129
Unimaginable.

1418
01:24:44,254 --> 01:24:46,379
Just the idea is funny.

1419
01:24:46,504 --> 01:24:47,462
[ laughs ]

1420
01:24:47,587 --> 01:24:50,587
Couldn't agree more.
Quite funny.

1421
01:24:54,587 --> 01:24:59,587
I rather blame Lady Manwaring's
scene-making for driving her husband away.

1422
01:24:59,712 --> 01:25:02,087
But her loss has been our gain.

1423
01:25:02,212 --> 01:25:04,921
As a result of the trouble
her solicitors caused,

1424
01:25:05,046 --> 01:25:07,587
we've had Manwaring stay
with us these past weeks.

1425
01:25:07,712 --> 01:25:09,754
That's not inconvenient?

1426
01:25:09,879 --> 01:25:12,296
Not at all.
Capital fellow.

1427
01:25:12,421 --> 01:25:14,671
Couldn't get on better.
Loves to hunt.

1428
01:25:14,796 --> 01:25:16,587
Small and large game.

1429
01:25:16,712 --> 01:25:19,462
Excellent, excellent to have a guest.

1430
01:25:19,587 --> 01:25:21,587
And the talk that comes with it.

1431
01:25:21,712 --> 01:25:26,671
Of course, Lady Susan's sharp,
but it's easier to talk with a fellow,

1432
01:25:26,796 --> 01:25:29,421
particularly one who shares
one's interests.

1433
01:25:29,546 --> 01:25:32,171
Before long, we'll have another guest.

1434
01:25:32,296 --> 01:25:33,462

1435
01:25:33,587 --> 01:25:36,212
No, of course.

Have you seen my husband?

1438

What have you been saying, tell me.
How is he?

1439
01:25:44,087 --> 01:25:48,171
Well, Madam.
Very well, I believe.

- Quite.

Oh!

1444
01:26:16,421 --> 01:26:18,754
Look up!

1445
01:26:25,462 --> 01:26:28,921
Ah, so, here's the church.

1446
01:26:30,587 --> 01:26:32,587
But where's the hill?

1447
01:26:32,712 --> 01:26:37,087
Don't see it.
Doesn't seem to be one.

1448
01:26:37,212 --> 01:26:40,046
Strange.
Odd.

01:27:01,421 --> 01:27:03,021
Please excuse me.

1454
01:27:04,337 --> 01:27:06,087
Your mother must be very proud.

1455
01:27:06,212 --> 01:27:08,087
And I am enormously grateful to her.

1456
01:27:08,212 --> 01:27:12,337
Without her efforts, I never
would have found such happiness.

1457
01:27:12,462 --> 01:27:14,629
Do excuse me.

1458
01:27:14,754 --> 01:27:16,462
And bearing false witness?

1459
01:27:16,587 --> 01:27:18,754
Oh, no, that would be the ninth.

1460
01:27:18,879 --> 01:27:21,254
You must be most proud of Frederica.

1461
01:27:21,379 --> 01:27:23,796
I would not say proud.

1462
01:27:23,921 --> 01:27:26,754
I'm glad I was able to
attend to her education.

1463
01:27:26,879 --> 01:27:30,588
My daughter has shown herself
to be cunning and manipulative.

1464
01:27:30,713 --> 01:27:34,088
I couldn't be more pleased.
A Vernon will never go hungry.

1465
01:27:34,213 --> 01:27:35,796
We must ask Frederica to sing.

1466
01:27:35,921 --> 01:27:38,635
That would be delightful.
Surry Songbird, we call her.

1467
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:40,254
What? No.

1468
01:27:40,379 --> 01:27:43,129
The Kentish Nightingale.
Always called her that.

1469
01:27:43,254 --> 01:27:46,463
Surry songbird?
What nonsense. Rubbish.

1470
01:27:46,588 --> 01:27:48,188
Ridiculous.

1471
01:27:50,671 --> 01:27:52,588
Ladies and gentlemen,

1472
01:27:52,713 --> 01:27:54,754
Mr. Reginald DeCourcy.

1473
01:27:54,879 --> 01:27:57,963
Over the past months I have
continued to be startled

1474
01:27:58,088 --> 01:28:01,296
by Frederica's
loveliness and good heart.

1475
01:28:01,421 --> 01:28:07,296
I had wanted to write some verses
as a memorial to these discoveries.

1476
01:28:07,421 --> 01:28:11,171
But they are now so extensive,
they would form a volume.

1477
01:28:11,296 --> 01:28:14,046
So I'll just read these few lines.

1478
01:28:23,529 --> 01:28:24,796
Mean engaging?

or countenance.

As you may already know, I take Lady
DeCourcy's requests as commands,

1485
01:28:55,088 --> 01:28:57,671

* Under the fountains *

1496

And very quickly, he was in good humor?

1497
01:29:44,129 --> 01:29:48,671
I see what you mean, how flattery
alters a man's spirits. It's delightful.

1498
01:29:48,796 --> 01:29:51,754
Such a posture, resenting
a well-meaning parent

1499
01:29:51,879 --> 01:29:54,379
is apparently common
among girls her age.

1500
01:29:54,504 --> 01:29:56,463
They are, perhaps, undercooked.

1501
01:29:56,588 --> 01:29:57,963
Not at all.
They're perfect.

1502
01:29:58,088 --> 01:30:02,754
Mmm. Yes, good tasting.
Quite sweet.

1503
01:30:02,879 --> 01:30:05,213

She's lovely.

1506
01:30:12,088 --> 01:30:15,088
No DeCourcy should forget the lengths
to which Lady Susan went

1507
01:30:15,213 --> 01:30:17,088
to prevent Charles Vernon
marrying Catherine,

1508
01:30:17,213 --> 01:30:20,171
which, had she succeeded, would have
ruined your sister's happiness forever.

1509
01:30:20,296 --> 01:30:22,588
Lady Susan sent her servant away?

1510
01:30:22,713 --> 01:30:25,463
And then you left, and
a few minutes later...

1511
01:30:25,588 --> 01:30:29,546
Mrs. Johnson, this is beyond
what I could have imagined.

1512
