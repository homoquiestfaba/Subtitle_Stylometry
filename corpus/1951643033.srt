She doesn't want to be your best friend.

82
00:08:16,200--> 00:08:18,000

When he/she discovers the sun it will be very hot.

106
00:09:59,200--> 00:10:03,100
- He/she would prefer to be to sleep.

00:18:01,400--> 00:18:03,600
- Barbaric, we have possessions.

187
00:18:04,700--> 00:18:06,600
- No so much.

188
00:18:06,600--> 00:18:10,000
Because you were not repaired,
a lion has just eaten our guide.

189
00:18:10,000--> 00:18:13,600
If you think we don't have problems,

We needed to catch the cacadeira.

218
00:22:21,800--> 00:22:23,900

Can we leave the lit lights?

242
00:25:31,200--> 00:25:33,100
I don't want to spend the battery.

243
00:25:33,100--> 00:25:35,700
So that we will need her after this night?

244
00:25:35,700--> 00:25:38,300
- You said that you/they found us of guile.
- He/she will meet.

245

248
00:26:04,700--> 00:26:07,000

Lament a lot, Mr. Newman,
but moment we cannot make anything else.

00:26:59,100--> 00:27:03,000
It doesn't tie tomorrow of guile.
If they don't return it ties there, we will go seek them.

261
00:27:03,100--> 00:27:07,000
And that we do meantime?
Did we wait here of crossed arms?

262
00:27:07,000--> 00:27:10,900
I think doesn't remain him/her other option.
Our helicopter doesn't fly at night.

263
00:27:10,900--> 00:27:13,900
- And because we didn't seek them for earth?
- That tried...

264
00:27:14,000--> 00:27:17,600
Mrs., because we are not in a vehicle
seeking them for earth?

00:27:17,600--> 00:27:19,900
We can, but with a pair of flashlights
we won't make anything.

00:36:36,700--> 00:36:38,000
For the right!

342
00:36:40,100--> 00:36:42,200
- Care
- For the right! For the right!

343
00:36:50,300--> 00:36:52,900
- We will collide.
- He/she catches you, Jess.

344
00:36:52,900--> 00:36:55,100
- You are going very fast.
- He/she catches you.

345
00:37:00,900--> 00:37:02,600
- Hold on to.!

346
00:37:07,800--> 00:37:09,800
- For the car, Amy!

347
00:37:23,500--> 00:37:27,300
Don't have ilus.es. He/she thinks can
with any one, he/she doesn't know this type.

348
00:37:27,300--> 00:37:31,100
And a good hunter. The best of this area.
But he/she doesn't want anything with us.

349
00:37:31,100--> 00:37:33,000
- Here this.
- He/she waits for me.

350
00:37:33,000--> 00:37:36,400
- As he/she told him/her, the type and crazy.
- If quizer to do this, it had continued for his/her bill.

351
00:37:46,000--> 00:37:48,100
Mr. Crawford

352
00:37:51,800--> 00:37:53,900
Is there anybody home?

353
00:38:02,700--> 00:38:06,100
- I am Tom Newman.
We spoke for I radiate, yesterday r night.

354
00:38:07,400--> 00:38:09,200
- I remember, yes.

355
00:38:11,200--> 00:38:14,900
- Did the forest guard find his/her family?
- No, they began the search this guile.

356
00:38:16,900--> 00:38:19,800
- Because I would not have ilus.es.
- Exactly.

357
00:38:19,900--> 00:38:22,700
Therefore I came here.
He/she waited that you podesse...

358
00:38:23,600--> 00:38:25,600
Filho of a female dog.

359
00:38:33,900--> 00:38:36,900
He/she told him/her that hunted the big five.

360
00:38:37,000--> 00:38:39,600
I don't seek boys' wives, friend.

361
00:38:39,600--> 00:38:42,100
One know how to track a leopard...

362
00:38:42,100--> 00:38:45,600
certainly that to seek three American tourists
it will be counted broad beans for itself.

363
00:38:45,600--> 00:38:47,600
It had not served him/her of anything to feed my ego.

364
00:38:47,700--> 00:38:49,700
- And if it feeds his/her pocket?

365
00:38:50,600--> 00:38:53,900
Mr. Crawford,
I am the engineer hidro-electrico...

366
00:38:53,900--> 00:38:56,900
that he/she supervises the construction
of the new dam, and I have responsibilities.

367
00:38:57,800--> 00:39:00,500
My family continues disappeared
r more than 24 hours.

368
00:39:00,500--> 00:39:04,600
Certainly that that had moved him/it,
nor that is a little.

369
00:39:04,600--> 00:39:08,100
Certainly that that had played in the
his/her small sensitive fiber...

370
00:39:08,100--> 00:39:11,600
why saying is like this,
I am willing to pay him/her...

371
00:39:11,600--> 00:39:13,900
...the one that you to ask me!

372
00:39:14,700--> 00:39:18,200
If it helps me to find my family.

373
00:39:26,700--> 00:39:28,400
Let us go!

374
00:39:31,000--> 00:39:32,800
Let us go!

375
00:39:36,500--> 00:39:37,800
Let us go!

376
00:39:50,100--> 00:39:52,000
What do make now?

377
00:40:00,800--> 00:40:04,700
Your father already one must have given bill that desaparemos.
He/she should have correspondent somebody to look for us.

378
00:40:05,900--> 00:40:07,900
To who?

379
00:40:07,900--> 00:40:10,100
I don't know, us of the hotel.

380
00:40:12,200--> 00:40:14,300
How will they find us?

381
00:40:16,200--> 00:40:19,900
- What do want to say?
- It will seek us in the main park.

382
00:40:19,900--> 00:40:23,600
Or in the surroundings...
but now we are very far away from there.

383
00:40:25,600--> 00:40:29,500
Maybe have to leave the car
and to try to return to foot.

384
00:40:29,500--> 00:40:33,400
Yes, the problem and that we don't have nor it idealizes
from where are.

385
00:40:37,600--> 00:40:39,400
- Caralho!

386
00:40:41,400--> 00:40:43,900
- And they won't know where we are
if we are here.

387
00:40:47,400--> 00:40:50,800
We won't take any risk.
In the car we will be in safety.

388
00:40:50,800--> 00:40:53,500
- And lost
- It is true that are lost.

389
00:40:54,800--> 00:40:57,700
- We won't leave the car.
- Why? Because you say him/it?

390
00:40:57,800--> 00:41:01,100
Because we are safe, Jess.
Because your father will meet.

391
00:41:01,100--> 00:41:03,100
And yes, because I say him/it me...

392
00:41:03,100--> 00:41:05,900
- Do you believe that he/she had found us?
- Yes, I believe.

00:41:06,800--> 00:41:09,100
- Is it been not to meet?
- He/she will meet.

394
00:41:09,100--> 00:41:11,200

395
00:41:11,300--> 00:41:14,200

- Damned you are, he/she will meet!

396
00:41:38,900--> 00:41:40,700
What are seeking?

00:41:41,700--> 00:41:43,600
Tobacco.

398
00:41:43,700--> 00:41:45,900
Vultures in the sky.
We will know when we come him.

399
00:41:46,000--> 00:41:49,400
We sought some track type
or something like that, Mr. Crawford?

400
00:41:49,400--> 00:41:52,400
Footprints were left, the rain turned off them.

401
00:42:02,100--> 00:42:02,900
Anything in the lake Maluti. We went for north.
The highways are empty.

402
00:42:06,500--> 00:42:09,700
Of course is empty, imbecile.
R night rained.

403
00:42:09,700--> 00:42:14,100
- Does he/she pick the forest guard's frequency?
- Facemo-lo once in a while.

404
00:42:14,433--> 00:42:18,300
- To cover the emptiness that those clowns leave.
- And that emptiness are those exactly?

405
00:42:18,400--> 00:42:21,900
Good, they want a fast rescue,
then efectuaram aerial searches.

406
00:42:21,900--> 00:42:25,300
The problem and that could fly
over his/her family...

407
00:42:25,400--> 00:42:27,800
...without not even they give if bill.

408
00:43:24,000--> 00:43:25,500
How these?

409
00:43:26,200--> 00:43:27,600

410
00:43:29,100--> 00:43:32,500

- We didn't see them during the whole guile.
- That doesn't mean that are not there out.

415
00:43:49,400--> 00:43:50,700
This well.

416
00:44:17,900--> 00:44:19,800
- What these to do?

417
00:44:22,000--> 00:44:24,100
I pick a little of it longs for here, of the storm.

418
00:44:31,800--> 00:44:33,000
Take.

419
00:44:45,100--> 00:44:46,800
- It was a good idea.

420
00:44:52,100--> 00:44:53,600
What does happen he/she?

421
00:44:57,600--> 00:45:00,000
A helicopter.

422
00:45:02,500--> 00:45:04,700
- He/she loosens me.
- Didn't I tell you?

423
00:45:04,800--> 00:45:08,800
- Is it been don't see us?
- They will see us. We won't leave the car.

424
00:45:25,100--> 00:45:29,700
No there are their signs in the river Crocodile.
We will see in the steppe of Letaba.

425
00:45:34,700--> 00:45:36,200
It is been to leave.

426
00:45:43,100--> 00:45:44,400
Here!

427
00:45:44,400--> 00:45:47,700
- Help! Return! Help!...

428
00:45:48,300--> 00:45:51,100
- Help! Return!

429
00:45:51,100--> 00:45:53,900
- Here! Return!

430
00:45:57,900--> 00:45:59,800
David, closes the door

431
00:45:59,800--> 00:46:01,700
- Jess, turn.
- Shit.

432
00:46:07,900--> 00:46:12,200
- Lament.
- You should have let to do.

433
00:46:12,200--> 00:46:14,200
- Let us return to the car.

434
00:46:15,000--> 00:46:17,800
We have to return to the car.

435
00:46:20,500--> 00:46:22,500
Let us go. Lament.

436
00:47:26,100--> 00:47:26,900
- Excuse.

437
00:47:28,500--> 00:47:30,100
Could they help us, please?

438
00:47:34,200--> 00:47:37,300
Please, we needed help.
Le.es attacked us.

439
00:47:37,300--> 00:47:39,500
They killed our guide and we are lost.

440
00:47:39,500--> 00:47:41,400
- He/she goes back to the car.

441
00:47:46,100--> 00:47:48,100
- They don't understand nor a word
of the one what do say I, no and truth?

442
00:47:48,100--> 00:47:50,800
Go. He/she locks the car.

443
00:48:18,900--> 00:48:22,200
- Who are?
- Stealthy hunters, I have faith.

444
00:48:22,200--> 00:48:25,200
- What do make?
- They hunt le.es.

445
00:48:25,900--> 00:48:29,800
- That disgust.
- Now I notice because you are vegetarian.

446
00:48:31,800--> 00:48:34,800
- Will they help us, no and truth?
- I don't know.

447
00:48:34,800--> 00:48:37,800
I didn't think that tied us importance.

448
00:48:37,800--> 00:48:41,900
I don't know if it passes people for here,
but it would be normal that demostrassem more interest.

449
00:48:41,900--> 00:48:44,000
Maybe know where there is longs for.

450
00:48:47,100--> 00:48:49,200
Yes, maybe.

451
00:48:51,000--> 00:48:53,100
Do point the riverside, yes?

452
00:48:55,100--> 00:48:57,600
Does David, lock the door when we lower, yes?

453
00:48:58,400--> 00:48:59,700
Of agreement.

454
00:49:13,000--> 00:49:16,500
Excuse.

455
00:49:16,500--> 00:49:19,200
Water. Does he/she have longs for?

456
00:49:19,800--> 00:49:21,500
He/she longs for...

457
00:49:30,200--> 00:49:32,600
Do they speak English? Can they help us?

458
00:49:34,700--> 00:49:38,500

- What do think these to do?

462
00:49:54,900--> 00:49:57,300
I will look for longs for for my brother.

463
00:49:58,300--> 00:50:02,400
One of us should be with David,
another should accompany the Dom Catanada.

464
00:50:02,400--> 00:50:04,700
You have black humor.

465
00:50:04,800--> 00:50:07,300
And that, I don't think good idea.

466
00:50:07,400--> 00:50:09,900
Amy, should trust me.

467
00:50:09,900--> 00:50:13,000
Had not it happened me anything, of agreement?
It had not happened me anything.

468
00:50:48,000--> 00:50:50,700
Is he/she the sure that and for here?

469
00:50:56,300--> 00:50:59,700
He/she is... much more...

470
00:50:59,700--> 00:51:01,400
...far?

471
00:51:03,600--> 00:51:04,400
Yes.

472
00:51:12,300--> 00:51:13,800
What does make he/she?

473
00:51:45,800--> 00:51:47,000

475
00:51:52,700--> 00:51:54,100
...to take?

476
00:51:54,200--> 00:51:56,700
To take of turn?

477
00:51:56,700--> 00:51:58,600
He/she waters her.

478
00:52:00,500--> 00:52:04,000
He/she waters her. Do you take her/it of turn?

479
00:52:05,200--> 00:52:07,000
To take?

480
00:53:32,800--> 00:53:36,000
And the other? Does he/she can cut her?

481
00:53:46,500--> 00:53:47,900
Thank you.

482
00:54:17,100--> 00:54:19,300
What? Come unfastened!

483
00:54:19,300--> 00:54:21,500
Come unfastened. What and this?

484
00:54:24,100--> 00:54:26,300
- What does happen he/she?

485
00:54:29,700--> 00:54:32,700
Amy. David.

486
00:54:44,100--> 00:54:45,500
What?

487
00:55:19,800--> 00:55:22,100
He/she arises for the car

488
00:55:22,100--> 00:55:23,800
What are to do?

489
00:55:25,400--> 00:55:28,000
- Thanks to God that these well.
- What did happen he/she? I heard a shot.

490
00:55:28,000--> 00:55:30,500
Where does it go? Arise for the car

491
00:55:31,800--> 00:55:34,500
Where does it go? The lion goes eat him/it

492
00:55:39,000--> 00:55:42,800
You cannot make anything, Jess.
You cannot make anything.

493
00:55:44,100--> 00:55:45,900
- Do you want a little?
- Yes.

494
00:56:04,200--> 00:56:06,700
- Scat
- Scat?

495
00:56:06,700--> 00:56:09,100
- Lion shit.

496
00:56:10,800--> 00:56:12,700
Of agreement.

497
00:56:12,700--> 00:56:16,500
Judging by his/her consistence,
he/she ate r little time.

498
00:56:16,500--> 00:56:18,700
And difficult to know that, exactly.

499
00:56:22,300--> 00:56:24,900
He/she is a voracious hungry from the drought.

500
00:56:25,900--> 00:56:29,700
Or he/she ate a gazelle, which and good
because he/she won't be so much hungry...

501
00:56:29,700--> 00:56:31,600
Or then?

502
00:56:33,900--> 00:56:36,600
- Or he/she ate another thing.
- A human?

503
00:56:36,700--> 00:56:40,800
Judging by the temperature,
he/she defecated there is a pair of hours.

504
00:56:41,600--> 00:56:44,600
What means that already this
quite far away from here.

505
00:56:45,600--> 00:56:48,000
- And that we do now?
- Now we will camp.

506
00:56:48,100--> 00:56:50,800
- Will we camp?
- Exacto.

507
00:56:50,800--> 00:56:54,700
No forest guard had found his/her family
after putting of the sun...

508
00:56:55,700--> 00:56:57,900
Mr. Newman.

509
00:57:48,200--> 00:57:50,900
Li reviewed nalguma of fauna and flora.

510
00:57:50,900--> 00:57:54,700
I don't remember where,
but and rare that attack people.

511
00:57:55,500--> 00:57:59,300
I Read that they have more fear of us
of the one what us of them, no and truth?

512
00:57:59,300--> 00:58:03,000
- Stupidity.
A starving lion eats what wants that is.

513
00:59:20,500--> 00:59:22,400
Amy, done these wake up?
- No.

514
00:59:26,900--> 00:59:30,400
- Me also.
The battery of my iPod finished.

515
00:59:30,500--> 00:59:32,500
Lament.

516
00:59:42,200--> 00:59:44,100
How did you meet my father?

517
00:59:45,500--> 00:59:47,900
Jess, don't want to speak of that now.

518
00:59:47,900--> 00:59:49,800
I only want to know.

519
01:00:03,700--> 01:00:06,400
Good... he/she was in an airplane...

520
01:00:06,400--> 01:00:09,100
Did they make him/it in an airplane?

521
01:00:09,100--> 01:00:12,000
If we made him/it in the airplane?

522
01:00:14,500--> 01:00:16,700
God! Lament.

523
01:00:18,600--> 01:00:20,400
- Continue.

524
01:00:22,300--> 01:00:25,200
It was seating two lines behind him.

525
01:00:26,000--> 01:00:28,100
It was a flight for Chicago.

526
01:00:29,000--> 01:00:31,100
And the half of the flight...

527
01:00:31,200--> 01:00:34,500
...he came and he/she asked me one could sit down
in the empty seat, to my side.

528
01:00:34,500--> 01:00:36,300
Did he approach you?

529
01:00:37,900--> 01:00:40,000
- What did want he/she?

530
01:00:42,100--> 01:00:45,000
We began to speak
and when I felt bill...

531
01:00:45,000--> 01:00:48,400
...we had to press the belt to cover with earth.

532
01:00:50,200--> 01:00:52,000
Of the one what did speak they?

533
01:00:52,900--> 01:00:56,200
- Of things... his/her life, my life.

534
01:00:58,400--> 01:01:00,200
- Things.

535
01:01:01,000--> 01:01:02,700
Is it then?

536
01:01:02,700--> 01:01:05,900
Then we covered with earth.

537
01:01:10,000--> 01:01:13,900
Your father had to be hit
another flight for New York.

538
01:01:14,000--> 01:01:17,000
You already imagine the surprise that I had...

539
01:01:17,000--> 01:01:19,400
...when I saw him/it to arise for my taxi.

540
01:01:19,400--> 01:01:22,000
- Did he leave the airplane?
- Yes.

541
01:01:23,200--> 01:01:25,000
He/she had un white lily.

542
01:01:26,600--> 01:01:29,400
- Only a white lily.

543
01:01:29,400--> 01:01:32,200
And it invited me to eat lunch.

544
01:01:32,200--> 01:01:34,200
That curio...

545
01:01:36,400--> 01:01:39,700
Used to let to impress me
with things like this, but...

546
01:01:39,700--> 01:01:42,000
...he was so...

547
01:01:43,000--> 01:01:44,900
...persistent, do you understand?

548
01:01:59,900--> 01:02:03,100
Your parents were separate
when I met your father.

549
01:02:03,100--> 01:02:07,400
I swear you.
He/she would never have gone out with him if it continued married.

550
01:02:07,400--> 01:02:10,400
He/she would not be seating here right now
if he was married.

551
01:02:12,000--> 01:02:15,500
Yes. But here we are.

552
01:02:28,100--> 01:02:31,800
- Amy, that and that?
- I don't know, I don't see anything.

553
01:02:33,900--> 01:02:36,100
This too darkness.

554
01:02:42,200--> 01:02:44,400
- Amy, don't see anything.
- I know, this so...

555
01:02:45,500--> 01:02:47,600
- My God
- What does happen he/she?

556
01:02:47,600--> 01:02:49,500
He/she lets to enter him.

557
01:02:51,400--> 01:02:52,900
- Open.

558
01:02:55,000--> 01:02:58,300
- These well?
- What did happen he/she? What does happen he/she?

559
01:02:59,500--> 01:03:01,500
Oh, my God.

560
01:03:24,800--> 01:03:27,000
- My God!

561
01:03:35,200--> 01:03:38,400
My God! He/she lowers you! He/she lowers you!

562
01:03:45,900--> 01:03:47,500
- He/she lowers you!

563
01:03:50,000--> 01:03:51,400
- My God!

564
01:04:17,300--> 01:04:19,700
It collects the windshields with the seats.

565
01:04:23,300--> 01:04:25,400
- He/she is going r leaves of behind.

566
01:04:29,700--> 01:04:31,500
Stoop down! Stoop down!

567
01:04:58,300--> 01:05:02,700
- Rest of the Leopard
pavilion of the luxury excrement...

568
01:05:02,700--> 01:05:05,800
They passed two days and two nights.

569
01:05:07,400--> 01:05:09,400
And if nobody doesn't come?

570
01:05:10,300--> 01:05:12,300
Tom will come.

571
01:05:14,100--> 01:05:16,100
Is it been not to meet?

572
01:05:16,100--> 01:05:18,100
Then we will wait.

573
01:05:19,800--> 01:05:21,600
Does it tie die of hunger?

574
01:05:24,100--> 01:05:27,300
We don't have a lot of opc.es.

575
01:05:27,300--> 01:05:29,800
We needed to go to a place
where they find us.

576
01:05:32,100--> 01:05:35,000
And as leaning to deceive le.es?

577
01:05:37,200--> 01:05:38,800
Maybe be full.

578
01:05:40,100--> 01:05:42,400
- Maybe be full?

579
01:05:43,800--> 01:05:46,200
Maybe have eaten another person.

580
01:05:46,200--> 01:05:48,800
- Maybe have given up.
- Maybe have...

581
01:05:48,800--> 01:05:52,400
Yes, and maybe they are just waiting
that we leave.

582
01:05:54,700--> 01:05:57,500
We needed food.
We are dehydrated.

583
01:05:57,500--> 01:06:02,000
And this stupid car that before protected us
this falling to the pieces.

584
01:06:02,100--> 01:06:05,800
In some moment, we will have
that to leave the car and to see what happens.

585
01:06:08,300--> 01:06:12,600
Our only two opc.es right now
they are: or we died from hunger...

586
01:06:12,700--> 01:06:14,800
...or what do eat us?

587
01:06:17,000--> 01:06:21,800
- I don't want to die here.
- I won't leave that you die here.

588
01:06:23,600--> 01:06:25,700
- What will make?

589
01:06:47,200--> 01:06:49,200
We are leaving with what have.

590
01:06:56,100--> 01:06:58,200
We needed of...

591
01:06:58,300--> 01:07:00,900
...for a barricade
in the windshields, of agreement?

592
01:07:04,400--> 01:07:07,800
I want that... Be careful with this.

593
01:07:07,900--> 01:07:10,600
I want that cut
the seatbelts...

594
01:07:10,700--> 01:07:15,800
...moorings in some way those seats
before the windshields, yes?

595
01:07:17,900--> 01:07:21,600
When you end,
we will cut these stuff and we will cover...

596
01:07:21,600--> 01:07:25,200
...the windows so that he/she doesn't enter the sun...
he/she makes too much heat in here.

597
01:07:25,300--> 01:07:27,400
Y I make the one what?

598
01:07:27,500--> 01:07:31,000
- What can make?
- Does to help me to do him/it inventory, ok?

599
01:07:31,000--> 01:07:35,400
Reviewed all of the pockets,
all of the sacks, all of the compartments.

600
01:07:35,500--> 01:07:38,000
I want to know that have exactly.

601
01:07:43,100--> 01:07:45,000
Mr. Crawford.

602
01:08:08,000--> 01:08:09,300
That disgust.

603
01:08:17,200--> 01:08:19,300
That has just pulled the foot.

604
01:08:19,300--> 01:08:22,000
- David, for of looking.
- But it pulled him/her the foot.

605
01:08:22,100--> 01:08:23,100
David.

606
01:08:23,100--> 01:08:25,400
Because you don't show me inventory him/it?

607
01:08:25,500--> 01:08:26,900
Let us go.

608
01:08:28,300--> 01:08:30,800
Good, I found two black feathers...

609
01:08:30,900--> 01:08:33,500
...the manual of the car,
a game of tools...

610
01:08:33,600--> 01:08:36,500
...several tissues, a map...

611
01:08:36,500--> 01:08:40,000
...elastic tablets
packings of tablets for the cough.

612
01:08:41,400--> 01:08:43,300
It is also found this.

613
01:08:46,700--> 01:08:48,600
- That no and mine.
- And yes.

614
01:08:48,600--> 01:08:50,300
No and.

615
01:08:50,300--> 01:08:53,000
Ah, yes? Then of who and?

616
01:08:58,100--> 01:09:00,700
And mine, this certain?

617
01:09:01,800--> 01:09:05,900
- Rs times tobacco when I am
nervous or stressada...

618
01:09:05,900--> 01:09:09,400
- It was nervous when I came for here and...

619
01:09:11,400--> 01:09:14,800
Rs times you leave me
completely stressada.

620
01:09:14,900--> 01:09:17,500
I suppose that rs times we can be
an unbearable mouthful.

621
01:09:17,500--> 01:09:19,900
A little, I believe.

622
01:09:22,600--> 01:09:25,300
Don't worry.
Your secret this safe connosco.

623
01:09:26,200--> 01:09:27,700
Thank you.

624
01:09:30,100--> 01:09:32,700
- This well, let us keep everything this.

625
01:09:42,100--> 01:09:45,400
Mr. Crawford, that no and a gazelle.

626
01:09:51,300--> 01:09:54,200
- What did seek? What do make?
- The rest of this type.

627
01:09:54,300--> 01:09:56,400
Wait there. Maybe have company.

628
01:09:59,000--> 01:10:00,800
- That and strange.

629
01:10:01,700--> 01:10:02,900
What?

630
01:10:03,000--> 01:10:05,400
They left all, suddenly.

631
01:10:12,000--> 01:10:14,500
As if they had fear or thing like this.

632
01:10:15,500--> 01:10:16,700
Fear?

633
01:10:26,100--> 01:10:30,200
Slowly. Let us retreat slowly.

634
01:10:58,500--> 01:11:00,500
- He goes...!

635
01:11:06,700--> 01:11:08,400
That and a car?

636
01:11:10,500--> 01:11:13,200
Yes, and a car.

637
01:11:13,300--> 01:11:15,500
This on the other side of the cordillera.

638
01:11:26,600--> 01:11:30,500
- The damned footprints disappeared.
- Let us return to the jeep and let us proceed.

639
01:11:31,300--> 01:11:34,200
- We will camp. Tomorrow of guile we will go to west.
- Will we camp?

640
01:11:34,200--> 01:11:36,400
We will camp and tomorrow of guile we will go to west.

641
01:11:36,500--> 01:11:40,400
- The forest guard this seeking to west.
- He/she doesn't make sense to continue r it seeks in that area.

642
01:11:40,400--> 01:11:43,600
I propose that seek
where no this the forest guard.

643
01:11:43,600--> 01:11:46,700
Newman, some time was hit
a good fright, friend?

644
01:11:46,700--> 01:11:48,200
Yes?

645
01:11:48,200--> 01:11:51,700
More is worth that accepts the facto
that maybe don't find them never.

646
01:11:55,500--> 01:11:58,500
- Let us leave the car and let us make noise.
- And the lion? And if he continues there?

647
01:11:58,500--> 01:12:00,400
He/she left.

648
01:12:04,400--> 01:12:08,400
- Well, I will approach the cordillera.
- What do say? You are not able to. And your ankle?

649
01:12:08,500--> 01:12:11,100
- Will I go me, of agreement?
- Nor to think.

650
01:12:11,200--> 01:12:15,000
- You don't have voice in the matter.
- Please, now no, of agreement?

651
01:12:15,900--> 01:12:17,600
I cannot get lost.

652
01:12:19,100--> 01:12:22,200
He/she takes my shoes.
They will hold on to better to your ankle.

653
01:12:25,500--> 01:12:27,700
Is there no time, do you understand?

654
01:12:48,100--> 01:12:52,600
You the tourists come here for the
your luxurious houses beside the swimming pool...

655
01:12:52,600--> 01:12:56,600
they return the house and they count all your adventures
as if it was a visit to the zoo.

656
01:12:57,300--> 01:12:59,800
Because here the zoo and you, friend.

657
01:13:01,800--> 01:13:04,000
And more is worth to face the truth.

658
01:13:05,300--> 01:13:08,000
Mr. Crawford, with his/her help or without her...

659
01:13:08,000--> 01:13:10,600
...I will arise in that shit vehicle...

660
01:13:10,700--> 01:13:14,000
...and I will travel ties to the last centimeter
square of this continent...

661
01:13:14,000--> 01:13:16,700
...he/she ties to find my family.

662
01:13:19,000--> 01:13:20,800

663
01:13:22,300--> 01:13:24,600

They are them. They are them!

Newman, think... Newman!

680
01:14:55,800--> 01:14:59,500
- What does happen he/she?
- They are descending the cordillera.

681
01:15:00,700--> 01:15:03,000
We will leave that them
