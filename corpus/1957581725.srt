00:52:59,190 --> 00:53:00,890
HAVE YOU EVER
WATCHED TENNIS?

1055
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:06,140
SO, HOW'S THE WHOLE
YOU-CHANGING THING GOING?

1056
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:09,550
IT'S OKAY, I GUESS.
IT'S NOT VERY EASY.

1057
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:11,920
IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE.

1058
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:14,020
YEAH.

1059
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:15,790
DO YOU FEEL BETTER?

1060
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:17,650
A LITTLE.

1061
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:19,760
AT LEAST I DON'T FEEL LIKE
EVERYONE HATES ME NOW.

1062
00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:22,760
EXCEPT FOR MAYBE JOHN,
BLAKE, AND EDDIE.

1063
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:24,760
AND THEY MIGHT NOT
EVER GET WHY.

1064
00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:27,030
YEAH.

1065
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:30,470
SO, WHAT WAS IT LIKE?

1066
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,640
WHEN YOU DIED?

1067
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:35,640
YOU SOUND LIKE MY SISTER.

1068
00:53:35,710 --> 00:53:39,280
WELL, NOT DYING,
BUT THE WHOLE VISION THING.

1069
00:53:42,110 --> 00:53:45,010
IT WAS FRIGHTENING.

1070
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:48,890
I JUST WANTED TO DIE...

1071
00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:51,860
OR HIDE FOREVER.

1072
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,260
I KEPT HEARING WARNINGS.

1073
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:59,330
IT WAS LIKE BEING TOLD
EVERYTHING I'VE EVER DONE WRONG.

1074
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:03,400
NOT LIKE YOUR PARENTS
LECTURE YOU, BUT SERIOUS.

1075
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:09,270
AND I REALIZED EVERYONE
WHO I'D HURT.

1076
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:12,140
MY PARENTS, ASHLEY, YOU,

1077
00:54:12,210 --> 00:54:15,280
ANYONE WHO I HAD
EVER BULLIED.

1078
00:54:15,350 --> 00:54:20,150
AND...I KNEW IN THE BACK
OF MY MIND

1079
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:24,090
WHAT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN DOING
THE WHOLE TIME.

1080
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:28,530
WHEN I WOKE UP,
I KNEW WHAT I HAD TO DO.

1081
00:54:28,590 --> 00:54:31,660
YOU HAVE CHANGED, YOU KNOW?

1082
00:54:31,730 --> 00:54:35,400
YEAH.
I CAN FEEL IT.

1083
00:54:35,470 --> 00:54:40,940
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,
I LIKE IT -- THE NEW YOU.

1084
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:01,220
Colton: DALLEN.

1085
00:55:01,290 --> 00:55:04,190
SARA. SARA.

1086
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:06,530
RIGHT HERE.
RIGHT HERE.

1087
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,420
I'LL GET IT.

1088
00:55:11,490 --> 00:55:12,750
NICE THROW.

1089
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:14,690
I GUESS I HAVE TOO MUCH STRENGTH
IN MY ARM.

1090
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:16,290
YEAH, THAT'S IT.

1091
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:18,030
OKAY, SO MAYBE I'LL STICK
TO TENNIS THEN.

1092
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:19,660
HEY, YOU'RE PRETTY GOOD
AT FRISBEE.

1093
00:55:19,730 --> 00:55:21,630
THANK YOU.
YEAH, RIGHT.

1094
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:23,660
OH, HEY!

1095
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:26,000
Ashley: JUST GIVE IT!

1096
00:55:26,070 --> 00:55:27,370
I DON'T HAVE IT.

1097
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:28,370
GIVE IT BACK.

1098
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:29,500
Colton: HEY.

1099
00:55:29,570 --> 00:55:30,840
YOU HAVING FUN, MAN?

1100
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:32,670
WE WERE. YOU OKAY?

1101
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:34,040
THEY WON'T GIVE
THE FRISBEE BACK.

1102
00:55:34,110 --> 00:55:35,880
[ Mockingly ] THEY WON'T GIVE
THE FRISBEE BACK.

1103
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:37,110
MAN, CUT IT OUT!

1104
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:38,250
YOU WANT THIS?
YEAH.

1105
00:55:38,310 --> 00:55:39,710
YEAH?

1106
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:42,080
THEN GO GET IT.

1107
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:43,780
I GUESS YOU GUYS
DON'T WANT TO PLAY.

1108
00:55:43,850 --> 00:55:45,200
OH, YOU'RE
INVITING US, NOW?

1109
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:47,100
NO, WE'LL LEAVE THE CHURCHES
TO YOU, MAN.

1110
00:55:47,170 --> 00:55:49,740
HEY. EDDIE.

1111
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:54,330
WHY DID THEY DO THAT?

1112
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:58,060
OPPORTUNITY. THEY CAN TURN
ANY SITUATION INTO TROUBLE.

1113
00:55:58,130 --> 00:56:01,530
[ SIGHS ]
I'LL GET THE FRISBEE.

1114
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:04,440
COME ON.
SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT.

1115
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:07,870
YOU'RE RUSTY.

1116
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:09,540
THANKS.

1117
00:56:09,610 --> 00:56:11,210
COME ON,
LET'S TRY IT AGAIN.

1118
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:24,270
HOW'S YOUR KNEE FEEL?

1119
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:25,810
IT'S GOOD.

1120
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:28,880
I'VE BEEN RUNNING AND GETTING
BACK INTO SHAPE.

1121
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:30,110
YOU'RE FAVORING IT.

1122
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:32,450
I KNOW.

1123
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:34,820
ARE YOU REALLY READY
FOR A MATCH?

1124
00:56:34,890 --> 00:56:37,120
YEAH.

1125
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:43,260
HEY, MOM.

1126
00:56:43,330 --> 00:56:47,030
WELL, WHO IS THIS YOUNG MAN
IN MY KITCHEN?

1127
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:49,100
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

1128
00:56:49,170 --> 00:56:51,500
I JUST GOT BACK
FROM CHURCH.
OH?

1129
00:56:51,570 --> 00:56:54,100
TALKED TO THE BISHOP.

1130
00:56:54,170 --> 00:56:56,470
HE SAYS I COULD BE ORDAINED
A PRIEST.

1131
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:59,880
I AM SO PROUD OF YOU.

1132
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:04,360
YEAH.

1133
00:57:04,430 --> 00:57:06,800
YOU DON'T SEEM EXCITED.

1134
00:57:06,870 --> 00:57:07,930
I AM...

1135
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,870
I GUESS.

1136
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:14,210
IT'S JUST THAT
IT STILL BOTHERS ME.

1137
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:15,640
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

1138
00:57:15,710 --> 00:57:18,190
EVERYTHING I'VE DONE WRONG.

1139
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:19,830
YOU STILL FEEL GUILTY?

1140
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:22,730
YEAH.

1141
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:25,540
DOES IT EVER GO AWAY?

1142
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:29,310
SOMETIMES THE HARDEST THING
IS TO FORGIVE YOURSELF.

1143
00:57:29,370 --> 00:57:31,610
HOW DO YOU DO IT?

1144
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:32,910
IT TAKES TIME.

1145
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:36,360
IT'S HARD
TO COMPLETELY FORGET,

1146
00:57:36,430 --> 00:57:39,370
BUT ONE MORNING
YOU'LL WAKE UP,

1147
00:57:39,430 --> 00:57:43,720
AND AT LEAST THE MEMORY
WON'T HURT ANYMORE.

1148
00:57:43,790 --> 00:57:46,560
YOU GONNA BE OKAY?

1149
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:49,690
YEAH.

1150
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,660
THANKS.

1151
00:57:52,930 --> 00:57:55,370
EDDIE.
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

1152
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:57,130
WELL, WE'RE HEADED
THE SAME DIRECTION.

1153
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,970
I THOUGHT MAYBE WE COULD
WALK TOGETHER.

1154
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:00,040
WHATEVER.

1155
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:01,440
ARE YOU IN A HURRY?

1156
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:03,540
YOU GOT A PROBLEM
WITH THAT?

1157
00:58:03,610 --> 00:58:05,110
NO.

1158
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:08,040
SO, UH, WE HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
AT CHURCH FOR A WHILE.

1159
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:09,550
"WE"?

1160
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:12,350
EVER NOTICE HOW IT'S ALWAYS
"WE" HAVEN'T SEEN YOU AT CHURCH?

1161
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:15,820
IT'S A DEAD GIVEAWAY
THAT YOU'RE SENT TO "SAVE" ME.

1162
00:58:15,890 --> 00:58:17,450
OKAY.

1163
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,560
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
IN A WHILE.

1164
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:21,990
BUT IT DOESN'T LESSEN
THE FACT THAT WE --

1165
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:23,790
I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU MORE.

1166
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:25,260
ARE YOU HITTING ON ME?

1167
00:58:25,330 --> 00:58:26,300
WHAT?

1168
00:58:26,370 --> 00:58:28,100
SAVE IT FOR COLTON.

1169
00:58:28,170 --> 00:58:29,270
HEY!

1170
00:58:29,330 --> 00:58:31,200
LOOK, WE JUST --

1171
00:58:31,270 --> 00:58:34,470
I MEAN, COLTON AND I, WE JUST
WANT TO BE YOUR FRIEND.

1172
00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:36,810
DO YOU EVEN REALLY
KNOW COLTON?
WELL, YEAH.

1173
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:38,510
'CAUSE HE'S NOT ALL CHURCHY
LIKE YOU THINK.

1174
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:41,040
HE PROBABLY DOESN'T EVEN CARE
ABOUT YOU.

1175
00:58:41,110 --> 00:58:42,280
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

1176
00:58:42,350 --> 00:58:44,820
I'VE SEEN HIM GET ALL CHURCHY
ON GIRLS BEFORE.

1177
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,180
IT'S AN ACT.

1178
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:48,080
10 MINUTES LATER
HE'S MAKING OUT WITH THEM.

1179
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:49,590
NEXT DAY HE DOESN'T
EVEN SAY HI.

1180
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:50,750
HE'S NOT LIKE THAT ANYMORE,

1181
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:52,620
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
LIKE THAT EITHER.

1182
00:58:52,690 --> 00:58:54,290
SAVE IT.

1183
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:56,360
ARE YOU EVEN HAPPY
WITH WHO YOU ARE?

1184
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:10,970
ARE YOU TRYING
TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER?

1185
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:13,240
NOT BY MAKING A FOOL
OF MYSELF.

1186
00:59:13,310 --> 00:59:16,350
YOU KNOW, WE NEED TO DO
SOMETHING I'M GOOD AT.

1187
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:19,100
ARE YOU FEELING
A LITTLE HUMBLED?

1188
00:59:19,170 --> 00:59:21,470
EMBARRASSED.
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE.

1189
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:25,510
ALL RIGHT. WELL,
WHAT DID YOU HAVE IN MIND?

1190
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:30,710
I, UH, TAKE IT
YOU MISS THIS.

1191
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:34,450
WHY WOULDN'T I?
COME ON.

1192
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:35,920
[ LAUGHS ]

1193
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:38,990
YOU KNOW, I THINK YOU'D FEEL
MORE COMFORTABLE IN THESE.

1194
00:59:39,050 --> 00:59:41,290
BUT THE BLADE'S SHORTER.
SO?

1195
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:42,860
WELL, I ALWAYS
KIND OF FIGURED

1196
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:45,760
THAT A LONGER BLADE WOULD,
YOU KNOW, HELP ME -- WHOA!

1197
00:59:45,830 --> 00:59:48,500
KEEP MY BALANCE.

1198
00:59:50,470 --> 00:59:54,070
SO, YOUR GAME'S COMING UP.
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

1199
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:55,970
NERVOUS.

1200
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:58,310
NERVOUS?
WELL, YOU'VE IMPROVED.

1201
00:59:58,370 --> 00:59:59,540
YOU HAVE.

1202
00:59:59,610 --> 01:00:04,040
THANKS, BUT I'LL FEEL BETTER
WHEN IT'S OVER.

1203
01:00:04,110 --> 01:00:06,680
ARE YOU DREADING TENNIS?

1204
01:00:06,750 --> 01:00:10,500
NEVER.

1205
01:00:10,570 --> 01:00:14,540
SO, UM, I SAW EDDIE
THE OTHER DAY.

1206
01:00:14,610 --> 01:00:16,470
REALLY?

1207
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:20,180
YEAH,
AND HE SEEMS PRETTY SET.

1208
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:23,380
WELL, LISTENING WAS NEVER
OUR STRONG POINT.

1209
01:00:23,450 --> 01:00:24,750
"OUR"?

1210
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:26,650
I SPEAK FOR
THE COLLECTIVE REBELS.

1211
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:27,880
OH.

1212
01:00:27,950 --> 01:00:29,690
BUT, YOU KNOW,

1213
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:32,760
I THINK HE KNOWS
WHAT HE'S DOING ISN'T RIGHT.

1214
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:34,720
SO DID I.

1215
01:00:34,790 --> 01:00:37,660
SO, THEN HOW DO WE MAKE HIM
WANT TO DO BETTER?

1216
01:00:37,730 --> 01:00:39,400
YOU SEE,
THE PROBLEM WITH EDDIE

1217
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:43,070
IS THAT HIS WHOLE DREAM
WAS TO BE COOL.

1218
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:45,070
WITH ME,
IT WAS JUST WHO I WAS.

1219
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:46,400
OH.

1220
01:00:46,470 --> 01:00:48,240
SO, I DIDN'T MEAN IT
LIKE THAT.

1221
01:00:48,310 --> 01:00:50,670
UH-HUH.
BACKPEDAL FASTER.

1222
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:56,150
HE JUST HAS TO REALIZE THAT WHAT
PEOPLE THINK ISN'T IMPORTANT.

1223
01:00:56,210 --> 01:00:57,680
WELL, THAT'S TOO BAD

1224
01:00:57,750 --> 01:01:01,250
THAT'S SOMETHING HE HAS
TO FIGURE OUT FOR HIMSELF.

1225
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:03,290
YEAH.
