Get up here!

182
00:08:55,818 --> 00:08:57,702
It's true. My family's not rich,

183
00:08:57,737 --> 00:08:59,403
and I'm not adventurous.

184
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:02,415
Yes, I like where this is going.

185
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,175
But my family loves each other,

186
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,344
so for show and tell,

187
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,660
I brought this photo of us
spending quality time together.

188
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,191
And that's why it was
the best summer ever.

189

You are the worst one of all!

190

for summer.

But we just got back
from summer.

192
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:23,336
Then you're dismissed
for summer again.

193

- Yeah, it's me!
- Fools!

248

The answer is man!

249
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:59,291
For it is man that crawls
on all fours as a baby.

250
00:11:59,327 --> 00:12:02,036
Walks on two feet through life,

251
00:12:02,072 --> 00:12:05,248
and then walks with two feet
and a cane in his old age.

252
00:12:05,283 --> 00:12:07,842

253
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:11,312
Greg's a man.

254
00:12:11,347 --> 00:12:13,423
- Yeah.
- But... No... I mean...

- But what?

Class. We have a new
student with us today.

275
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:01,037
So, I'd like to start our lesson by
reviewing some of the self-defense basics.

276
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:04,156
Now, you should know right off the bat
that some of my self-defense techniques

277
00:13:04,191 --> 00:13:06,292
are considered extreme.

278
00:13:06,328 --> 00:13:09,286
- Extreme?
- It's not as bad as it sounds.

279
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:11,731
Let me demonstrate. If an
attacker comes at you head on...

280
00:13:11,766 --> 00:13:13,166
Make like you're
about to attack me.

281
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,105
First, grab their wrist
with your dominant hand.

282
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,556
Then, their elbow
with your other hand.

283
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,905
Then drop quickly to your knees

284
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,765
and beg him not to hurt you.

285
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,225
Don't hurt me! Please!

286
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,618
Oh! Oh, no!

287
00:13:23,653 --> 00:13:25,978
Please!
I have so much to live for!

288
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:27,134
- (GRUNTS)
- Always remember.

289
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:30,811
Firmly establishing that you are not
a threat neutralizes the attacker.

290
00:13:30,835 --> 00:13:32,902
That can't work
in the real world!

291
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:34,415
It does. Here, I'll show
you another technique.

292
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:36,630
Put me in a headlock.

293
00:13:36,665 --> 00:13:38,619
If an attacker gets you in a
headlock, just take your free hand,

294
00:13:38,643 --> 00:13:40,726
and reach it way back like this.

295
00:13:40,762 --> 00:13:42,428
Remove your phone
from your pocket

296
00:13:42,463 --> 00:13:44,830
and show him
pictures of your family.

297
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:48,026
Do not shy away from bringing
your kids into this.

298
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:49,789
It's hard to assault someone when
you're staring at the innocent faces

299
00:13:49,813 --> 00:13:51,421
of mini versions of them.

300
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:54,574
Shouldn't you be teaching us how to throw
around someone who's twice our size?

301
00:13:54,609 --> 00:13:56,751
I do teach that!

302
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:58,844
It's a technique where you
grab someone by the arms

303
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,239
hold them behind their back
so they can't move,

304
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:02,998
and then toss them
at your attacker.

305
00:14:03,034 --> 00:14:04,525
Toss them at the attacker?

306
00:14:04,561 --> 00:14:06,177
Who are you tossing?

307
00:14:06,254 --> 00:14:08,337
That could be anyone.
A wife, a friend, a co-worker,

308
00:14:08,372 --> 00:14:10,075
whoever's next to you
when you get attacked.

309
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,774
It's called diversion.

310
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:14,794
And, of course, the mother of
all self-defense techniques...

311
00:14:14,829 --> 00:14:16,554
Crying.

312
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:19,148
Yeah, I didn't sign up
to learn how to cry.

313
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:20,611

would work in real life.

Listen! (CLEARS THROAT)

355
00:16:41,175 --> 00:16:43,751
As I was going to St. Ives,
I met a man with seven wives.

356
00:16:43,786 --> 00:16:46,170
The seven wives had seven sacks,

357
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:48,314
the seven sacks had seven cats.

358
00:16:48,349 --> 00:16:50,508
The seven cats had seven kits.

359
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:53,536
How many were going to St. Ives?

360
00:16:53,571 --> 00:16:56,171
Okay, so, seven times seven,

361
00:16:56,207 --> 00:16:57,965
times seven times seven...

362
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,545
No, see, now you don't
count the seven sacks.

363
00:16:59,569 --> 00:17:01,210
Sacks aren't alive.

364
00:17:01,245 --> 00:17:02,685
Okay. Shh!
I'm in the middle of this.

365
00:17:03,681 --> 00:17:05,047
Seven times seven times seven...

366
00:17:05,082 --> 00:17:07,299
No, seven divided by seven,

367
00:17:07,335 --> 00:17:09,810
because they're divided
into sacks, remember?

368
00:17:09,846 --> 00:17:11,428
Ugh! I used to be
so good at this!

369
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:12,604
Okay.

370
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,407
Seven times seven times...

371
00:17:14,484 --> 00:17:16,642
Okay, sorry. Who are the wives?
Was it the cats...

372
00:17:16,678 --> 00:17:20,037
No, seven wives divided
by seven sacks is one.

373
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:21,513
Are you sure about this?

374
00:17:21,549 --> 00:17:22,907
I'm positive. 100%.

375
00:17:23,893 --> 00:17:26,018
The answer is one.

376
00:17:26,054 --> 00:17:29,246
(LAUGHING) Fools!

377
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:33,034
The riddle only said
I was going to St. Ives.

378
00:17:33,069 --> 00:17:34,535
The cats and wives
are irrelevant.

379
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:36,670
The answer is one!

380
00:17:37,832 --> 00:17:39,482
Yeah, that's what we said.

381
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:41,508
- Yeah.
- Yes, but...

382
00:17:41,544 --> 00:17:43,227
But you got it all wrong.

383
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:45,096
No, we didn't. We got it right.

384
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:46,850
But your math, you were doing
math, there's no math.

385
00:17:46,874 --> 00:17:48,932
That's the whole
point of the riddle.

386
00:17:48,968 --> 00:17:51,451
The answer is one
and we said one.

387
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,379
You didn't say we
had to show our work.

388
00:17:53,414 --> 00:17:54,939
Yeah, you gotta eat
yourself, Sphinx.

389
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:57,350
Yeah, Sphinx!

390
00:17:57,385 --> 00:17:58,609
I'm not going to eat myself.

391

What's in St. Ives, anyway?

you said to us was,
