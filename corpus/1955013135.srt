What the...
What was that?

7
00:00:38,506 --> 00:00:41,041
Molly?
What did you do?

8
00:00:41,242 --> 00:00:43,177
Relax. It was just
half an M-80 this time.

9
00:00:44,278 --> 00:00:45,546
Look, I made a crater.

10
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:47,081
You have to come
to see this.

11
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:48,116
I layered the sediment,

12
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:49,083
And the ejecta
looks exactly...

13
00:00:49,917 --> 00:00:49,983
It's 4:30
in the morning.

14
00:00:50,818 --> 00:00:50,884
I swear,
I have neighbors.

15
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:53,053
Why are you
doing this now?

16
00:00:53,954 --> 00:00:54,655
For Geology.
It's due tomorrow.

17
00:00:55,823 --> 00:00:58,126
Or today in, like,
3 1/2 hours actually, and...

18
00:00:58,326 --> 00:01:00,194
I have to get up
in the morning.
Remember that?

19
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:03,597
I swear, at least
just one time,
I'm begging you,

20
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,065
Just let me sleep
through the night.

[Chuckles]

22
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:09,403
There's gas lines
and water lines
down there.

23
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:10,738
I checked.

24
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:13,107
You can't just randomly
do stuff like this.

25
00:01:13,307 --> 00:01:14,442
I checked.
What?

26
00:01:15,643 --> 00:01:16,844
I had the utilities
come out yesterday and mark,

27
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:19,147
And he did a survey,
and he marked.

28
00:01:19,347 --> 00:01:20,214
Look, I'm not stupid.

29
00:01:21,048 --> 00:01:22,183
And how much
did that cost?

30
00:01:23,217 --> 00:01:24,385
I... They spread it out
over the bills.

31
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:28,088
Look, I just... It just
took me a lot longer
than I planned.

32
00:01:28,289 --> 00:01:29,757
A lot longer, and...

33
00:01:33,327 --> 00:01:36,230
All right, I'm up now.

34
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,631
Show me what you're doing,
Professor.

35
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:41,669
I wanted
to recreate craters
from volcanic eruptions,

36
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:43,271
And I had
to do it here,

37
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:44,872
Because the sedimentary
deposits are exactly...

38
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,308
You couldn't have just made
a baking soda volcano?

39
00:01:48,376 --> 00:01:49,377
Well, as sad as I know
it makes you, Dad,

40

get out of here.

We'll be out of cell range
till Monday at least.

70

00:04:07,715 --> 00:04:10,318
We'll have them all in
by tomorrow evening.

72
00:04:10,518 --> 00:04:13,321
And I cannot wait
to come home.

73
00:04:13,521 --> 00:04:14,688
I've missed you both.

74
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:16,790
So good night.

00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,626

where are you?

77
00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:33,441
Oh, another
all-nighter, huh?

78
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:34,475
Science doesn't sleep.

79
00:04:35,309 --> 00:04:35,909
Heh.
But normal people do.

80
00:04:36,744 --> 00:04:38,278
I did.
I just got up early.

81
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:40,280
Done.

82
00:04:41,549 --> 00:04:43,951
Yes!

83
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:46,019
Ah, it was just
a bad power supply.

84
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:49,790
All 19 sensors are
up and running perfectly.

85
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,058
Make you some eggs?

86
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:52,726
Oh, no, no, no.
I made breakfast.

87
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:55,295
Wait. What? Heh.
Since when?

88
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:57,765
Since I thought it
would melt the ice storm
with Miss you-know-who.

89
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,066
I thought we could
all eat together.

90
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:00,067
Oh, that's sweet,

91
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:01,935
But I told you
I'm taking up

92
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:03,637
A couple of lovebirds
at 8:00 this morning.

93
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:04,972
I only got
a couple of minutes.

94
00:05:05,506 --> 00:05:06,674
What? When?

95
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:09,710
Last night,
when you were futzing
with your iPad.

96
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:12,413
Shoot!

97
00:05:12,613 --> 00:05:14,548
Maybe I should have
sent you a text message.

98
00:05:14,748 --> 00:05:15,749
No, it's okay.
I'm sorry.

99
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:17,585
I've been distracted.

100
00:05:17,785 --> 00:05:19,453
And working
a little too hard?

101
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:20,788
No, look, I'm sorry.

102
00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:22,723
I'm just getting
really close. These swarms.

103
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:26,627
You know, we've had
12 minor M1 quakes
in the last 72 hours.

104
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,362
Something's up,
something big.

105
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:30,831
I don't feel like I have
any time to waste.

106
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:33,867
Well, I'm sure
you'll figure it out.
I know you will.

107
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:36,537
At least let me
get you some toast.

108
00:05:37,638 --> 00:05:39,440
Oh.

109
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,841
You like yours
well done, right?

110
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,776
[Chuckles]
Perfect.

111
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:46,380
Is Ali awake?

112
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,848
I made
her favorites,

113
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:50,751
French toast
with mascarpone
and turkey sausage.

114
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:52,953
You know
how to make all that?

115
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:56,089
No, but there's these
wonderful little books
that I found

116
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:57,791
With step-by-step
instructions.

117
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:00,528
Cooking books,
I think that's
what you call them.

118
00:06:00,728 --> 00:06:01,695
She'll come around.

119
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:03,363
I hope so.
Eventually.

120
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:05,098
Stepmoms are
no competition

121
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:07,568
For the influence
of a new boyfriend.

122
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:08,769
Mm.

123
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:10,938
I figure when
that relationship ends,

124
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,542
And I hope soon,
that she'll turn
to me again

125
00:06:14,742 --> 00:06:17,478
And I could convince her
to go back to school.

126
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:18,479
Mm-hmm.

127
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:20,548
[Beeping]
Oh.

128
00:06:20,748 --> 00:06:21,815
[Sighs]
Just a minute.

129
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:23,150
Right.
Hold on.

130
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,152
Morning, Ali.
I made you
breakfast.

131
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:27,755
Dad. Molly.

132
00:06:27,955 --> 00:06:29,122
Really?
Hank.

133
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:31,559
Thanks,
but I gotta run.

134
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,595
But it's French toast
with mascarpone.

135
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:36,063
Trying to watch
what I eat,

136
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:37,798
All that sugar and carbs.

137
00:06:37,998 --> 00:06:39,933
Oh, please.
You're a rail.

138
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,502
I gotta jet anyway.

139
00:06:41,702 --> 00:06:42,736
You know
how long it takes

140
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:44,004
To get from Rosemead
to downtown?

141
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:45,606
Why do we even live here?

142
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:47,675
Because Rosemead
sits on a giant slab
of granite,

143
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:48,876
And that's
exactly where you

144
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:50,611
Want to be
when an earthquake
strikes.

145
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:52,913
Well, it's not where you
want to be when you're 18.

146
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:55,182
Well, why don't you
have your boyfriend
over here?

147
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:56,584
We can
all have dinner.

148
00:06:57,585 --> 00:06:57,918
There's no boy.
See you later, Dad.

149
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:01,655
You think
your passengers
want breakfast?

150
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:03,957
[Chuckles]
I have plenty.

151
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:07,427
Put it in the fridge.
I'll have it for dinner.

152
00:07:07,628 --> 00:07:10,598
And for one day, try to
not think of earthquakes.

153
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:14,568
ANCHOR:
A series of minor temblors

154
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,770
Causes jitters
throughout the Southland.

155
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,506
Two dozen tiny earthquakes

156
00:07:18,706 --> 00:07:21,208
Registering 1.0
on the Richter Scale or lower

157
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:24,478
Has seismotologists scratching
their heads this morning,

158
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:26,814
While the string
of temblors seems to have gone

159
00:07:27,014 --> 00:07:29,016
Largely unnoticed
for most Los Angelenos.

160
00:07:29,216 --> 00:07:31,619
We'll check in with Tippi Santos
at Venice Beach,

161
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:34,488
And your weather report
from Kaz.

162
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,158
MOLLY: Okay, now with
this final piece in place,

163
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:40,594
All 19 sensors
along the entire fault line

164
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:41,795
Are gonna start
pinging each other,

165
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:43,997
And the system
is gonna crunch that data

166
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:46,500
And send me back reports.
And when we take

167
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:49,970
All the data streams
from all the sensors,
we get this. Danny?

168
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,039
Hold on
to your butts.

169
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:56,009
Each sensor monitors
microseismic activity,

170
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:58,612
And that's the changing
ratio between sheer waves

171
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,481
And pressure waves
within a 50-mile radius.

172
00:08:01,682 --> 00:08:04,518
Real-time monitoring?
That's nothing new.

173
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:06,019
No, not just
real-time monitoring.

174
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:08,055
Predictive extrapolations

175
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:09,857
For all
microquake activities

176
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:11,992
Along the entire
San Andreas Fault.

177
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:15,663
See these white circles?
They're microquakes.

178
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:18,666
Can anyone tell me
the importance
of the microquake?

179
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:21,702
Well, they're important,
because...

180
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:23,103
Because some
theorize they could be

181
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:24,104
Good predictors
for foreshocks

182
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:26,139
Or even quakes
themselves.

183
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,075
And if we were
in the business

184
00:08:28,275 --> 00:08:29,643
Of predicting earthquakes,
the microquake

185
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,679
Would be
our best source of data.

186
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:34,548
But it can't be done,
'cause it's
not possible.

187
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:36,516
What can't?
Predicting quakes.

188
00:08:38,085 --> 00:08:38,952
Well, that might be true,
but I happen to believe
that it can be.

189
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:41,221
Yeah, and how'd
that work out
for you in 2008?

190
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,824
[Giggles]

191
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,025
[Sighs]

192
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:48,228
Well, someone's done
their homework for once.

193
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:50,130
Yes, I was wrong.
I guess you could say

194
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,633
I acted before I had
all the data. I was hasty.

195
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,134
But this is different.

196
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:54,935
Here's the catch.

197
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:57,304
See these white circles?

198
00:08:57,504 --> 00:08:58,639
They're microquakes,

199
00:08:59,539 --> 00:08:59,907
And they haven't
happened yet.

200
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,108
But I will bet you

201
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:02,676
Dollars to doughnuts,
they will,

202
00:09:03,711 --> 00:09:04,845
And in an hour's time,
to be specific.

203
00:09:05,813 --> 00:09:06,880
And in predicting
the microquake,

204
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:08,816
We can further
extrapolate that data

205
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,885
Into exponentially bigger,
more timely predictions.

206
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:13,887
[Scoffs]
I don't buy it.

207
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:16,890
And that's all the time
we have for today.

208
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,926
Come get
your graded field reports.

209
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:20,027
Really good job, everybody.

210
00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:21,294
And if you have
any questions,

211
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:22,963
I'll be in the campus café,
okay?

212
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,949
All right.

213
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:43,216
Come on.

214
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,685
[Sighs]

215
00:09:44,885 --> 00:09:45,953
Show me
something good.

216
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:50,758
I deserve an "A."
What?

217
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,860
I need it.
I could lose
my scholarship.

218
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,127
You should have
studied more.

219
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:55,328
I'm trying, okay,

220
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:57,665
But do you know
how many classes I have,

221
00:09:57,865 --> 00:09:58,999
How much I have to read?

222
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:00,668
I'm working
all the time.

223
00:10:00,868 --> 00:10:01,969
"A" students
make the time.

224
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:07,307
I have a problem with
know-it-all students who
show a lot of promise

225
00:10:07,507 --> 00:10:10,377
And squander it all away
on girls and drinking.
I know your type.

226
00:10:10,577 --> 00:10:11,745
You read
"On the Road" once,

227
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,380
And suddenly you have
all the answers.

228
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:15,348
I'm not seeing
a lot of girls.

229
00:10:16,717 --> 00:10:17,317
I might just be
a teacher, but I hear
all the gossip.

230
00:10:18,518 --> 00:10:20,120
And that's great.
You should be
having fun.

231
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,388
But just because
you're smart, Nick...

232
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:23,190
[Cellphone ringing]
And you really are.

233
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:25,993
I can see
what you're capable of
when you actually try.

234
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:28,261
But it doesn't mean
you don't have
to do the work.

235
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,629
[Ring]

236
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,832
Now excuse me.

237
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:32,833
Hey.

238
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:34,134
Hey. You okay?

239
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:35,302
Yeah, I'm fine.
Just a student.

240
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:37,037
Same old, same old.
Any word from Ali

241
00:10:38,005 --> 00:10:38,806
On her first day
at the front desk?

242
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:41,341
You know Ali. She's probably
running that hotel by now.

243
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,243
She can fend
for herself.

244
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:44,978
Too true.
You taking off yet?

245
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:46,246
I'm gassing up right now.

246
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:47,748
Hey, how was
the field trip?

247
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:49,983
It was fine, except for

248
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:51,852
The aforementioned student
brought up 2008.

249
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:54,121
Ah, forget 2008.

250
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:56,389
Remember that Edison
failed, like, 10,000 times

251
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:58,025
Before he invented
the lightbulb, right?

252
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:00,761
You mean,
before he stole it
and patented the idea?

253
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:02,095
[Chuckles]
I'm just nervous.

254
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:04,732
I'm waiting on some data
to come in.

255
00:11:04,932 --> 00:11:05,733
[Beeping]

256
00:11:05,933 --> 00:11:08,068
Oh, my God.

257
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:10,203
What is it?
Oh, my God!

258
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:12,405
What's going on?
Oh, my God, Hank!

259
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:13,807
Molly, tell me
what's happening.

260
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:14,908
It's working!

261
00:11:15,776 --> 00:11:16,443
It's really,
really working.

262
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:18,311
Hank, oh, my God!
What is?

263
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:19,847
The microquakes
that I predicted.

264
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:21,782
The pressure,
the velocity, the slip,

265
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:23,116
You name it,
it's happening!

266
00:11:23,784 --> 00:11:24,818
That's great, right?

267
00:11:25,953 --> 00:11:27,020
Oh, my God, I'm gonna
have to call you back.

268
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,257
I gotta call
that smug S.O.B.
over at Caltech.

269
00:11:30,457 --> 00:11:31,358
I love you.

270
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:32,826
I love you, too.
Yeah, go, go, go.

271
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:33,761
I'll talk to you later.
Bye.

272
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:37,364
Professor Dunn?

273
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:38,365
Yeah, look at that.

274

276
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:44,171
That's 45 to 63 minutes
in advance.

277
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:45,205
That's incredible.

278
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:46,406
It's more
than incredible.

279
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:48,275
It's...

280
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:52,846
Oh, no.
Oh, I was worried
about the swarm.

00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:54,214
Something's up.
What?

282
00:11:55,282 --> 00:11:56,917
Look.

283
00:11:57,117 --> 00:11:58,385
It's big,
and it's close.

284
00:11:58,585 --> 00:12:00,087
You're saying that's
gonna hit in two minutes?

this system

286
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:05,725

in predicting them.

287
00:12:16,636 --> 00:12:17,838
Oh.

288
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,908
We've gotta
get everybody out.

289
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:22,910
NICK: Are you sure?
I mean,

290
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,878
Where are you getting
this confirmation data from?

291
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:26,379
Yes, I'm sure.
Straight from the USGS.

292
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,248
But have you checked
the raw data yet?

293
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:30,350

to get everyone

294
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,252

an earthquake.

Okay.
I have to talk

297
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:37,457

about that.

298

I'm sure everything

299
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:40,160
Is gonna be okay,
all right?

300
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:41,161

to worry about.

East of Point Mugu.

351
00:14:57,998 --> 00:14:58,631
Oh, man,
it's taking down houses

352
00:14:59,366 --> 00:14:59,666
And high-tension wires.

353
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,134
Possible injuries.

354
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:03,136
Notify emergency
services immediately.

355
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:04,337
Oh, my God.

356
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:05,472
[Radio] Roger that,
Bell Four Twelve.

357
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:07,307
We're on it.
That's an earthquake.

358
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:09,009
We're getting shook up
pretty good down here.

359
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:10,543
Sit tight
up there for a moment.

360
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:12,912
We're suggesting a reroute
over to Malibu Creek. Over.

361
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,081
Roger that, Control.

362
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:17,084
Excuse me, guys.

363
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:19,419
I need to make
a quick call.

364
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:23,590
Ali, it's Dad.
Are you okay?

365
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:32,165
What are you
so happy about?

366
00:15:32,365 --> 00:15:34,467
4.7 magnitude.
I was dead on.

367
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:37,204
[Cellphone ringing]
I mean, off by a minute,

368
00:15:37,404 --> 00:15:38,938
But, hell, close enough.

369
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:40,607
Hank, are you okay?

370
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:42,042
I was gonna ask you
the same thing.

371
00:15:42,242 --> 00:15:43,310
We could see
the shaking

372
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,244
From up here.
Are you okay?

373
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:45,645
Yeah. How's Ali?
She's fine.

374
00:15:45,845 --> 00:15:47,047
I just talked
to her.

375
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:49,582
Actually,
everything's great.

376
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,584
My system gave me
over three minutes
warning.

377
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,686
I was able to get
everyone to safety
before it struck.

378
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:55,055
Thank goodness.

379
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:56,156
So much for
no earthquakes today, huh?

380
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,458
[Chuckles] Right.
Tell me about it.

381
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:00,493
How'd your buddy Chet
take it?

382
00:16:01,594 --> 00:16:02,229
Oh, my God. I haven't
even called him yet.

383
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:03,463
Everything happened
so fast.

384
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:07,067
Well, make sure you
be careful, all right?

385
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:09,069
[Beeping]

386
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:15,142
Hank.

387
00:16:15,342 --> 00:16:17,244
Hank, oh, my God.

388
00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:18,545
We've gotta get Ali
and get out of town.

389
00:16:18,745 --> 00:16:20,280
What are you
talking about?

390
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,550
All the data
from the sensors
confirm it.

391
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,552
This is it.

392
00:16:25,752 --> 00:16:28,055
The Big One's
coming today.

393
00:16:30,123 --> 00:16:32,459
ANCHOR: Shaken,
but not stirred.

394
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:35,262
A 4.0 temblor
off the Malibu coast,

395
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:38,398
Or what Los Angeles residents
call Wednesday.

396
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:40,567
Good afternoon, everyone.
I'm Ron Jantz,

397
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:44,237
And this is a 10 Action News
special report.

398
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:47,640

of Pacific Palisades today

Are reporting moderate damage
and no injuries after what...

[Sirens blaring]

401
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,614
A hundred years old?

402
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:56,316
I thought this place
was new.

403
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:57,584
How can that be safe?

404
00:16:57,784 --> 00:16:59,152
Sir, I assure you,

405
00:17:00,387 --> 00:17:00,787
The hotel has
been retrofitted
for earthquakes.

406
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:02,689
I know it looks
threadbare right now,

407
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:04,657
But we do plan
to refurbish next year.

408
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:09,062
No, no. I need
a lower room at least
near an exit.

409
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:11,264
Ooh. [Chuckles]
I always said

410
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:13,766
The first time
Arnie and I kissed,
the Earth moved.

411
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:16,736
Glad to see
we haven't lost
our touch.

412
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:18,071
So it was your fault.

413
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:19,572
Well, no more,
please.

414
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:22,209
I see you
had a productive time
shopping.

415
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:23,510
That's a beautiful
necklace.

416
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,812
Oh, you're a dear.

417
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:27,480
Rubies are
for the 40th,

418
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,150
But I
prefer diamonds.

419
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:33,186
[Chuckles]
I don't usually
shop like this,

420
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:36,456
But it is
our anniversary.

421
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:37,757
Duty calls.

422
00:17:37,957 --> 00:17:39,159
That's right.
You told us.

423
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:40,160
That is
so wonderful.

424
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,395
Oh, you know,
we shared

425
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:46,065
Our first kiss
right over there.

426
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:48,235
It was blue
crushed damask then,

427
00:17:48,435 --> 00:17:49,736
But fashions
change.

428
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:52,372
Anyways, would you
please hold our bags

429
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,141
While we go
have a quick bite?

430
00:17:54,341 --> 00:17:55,808
Absolutely.

431
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:58,077
Never go to bed angry.

432
00:17:58,278 --> 00:17:59,446
That's the secret.
Heh heh heh.

433
00:17:59,646 --> 00:18:01,448
Dear? Dear?

434
00:18:01,648 --> 00:18:03,816
You two would make
a cute couple.

435
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:05,552
I'm hungry.

436
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:07,854
Don't wait too long.
Let's go.

437
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:10,690
Just a quick bite.
Back soon.

438
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,259
Take your time.

439
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:13,693
Oh, we'd make
such a cute couple.

440
00:18:13,893 --> 00:18:15,128
What would
your boyfriend say?

441
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:16,396
What would yours say?

442
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:17,397

00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:20,633
Cover me a minute?
It's the stepmom.

445
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:22,435
She probably is just
freaked about that quake.

446
00:18:22,902 --> 00:18:23,770
Really?

447
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,272
He can
help you, sir.

448
00:18:25,472 --> 00:18:26,873
Molly, I'm fine.

449
00:18:27,073 --> 00:18:28,208
We barely felt it
downtown.

450
00:18:28,408 --> 00:18:31,711
Good. But now
you're going
to have to leave work.

451
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:33,613
Things are gonna get
really bad.

452
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:35,215
What? No.

453
00:18:35,415 --> 00:18:36,849
We are getting
out of town now.

454
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:38,351
Not this again.

455
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:40,853
I will pay you $1,000
to get out of there now.

456
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:44,291
I won't say another word
about your boyfriend,
whoever he is.

457
00:18:44,491 --> 00:18:48,295
Listen to me.
This is going
to be a 10.0.

458
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:51,331
The hotel has
only been retrofitted
for up to an 8.0.

459
00:18:51,531 --> 00:18:55,168
Ali, downtown
is a seismic
amplification corridor.

460
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:56,336
It will be destroyed.

The lady from Caltech
is on TV right now.

462
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:01,140
She says it's nothing
to worry about.

Hello?

464
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:04,244

00:19:04,444 --> 00:19:05,312
Ali? Hank?

I'm here.

The call must
have dropped.

I'll try her again.
Wait, wait, wait.

471

What if the cells go down?
What should we do?

00:19:16,423 --> 00:19:17,757
What?
Molly, can you hear me?

00:19:17,957 --> 00:19:19,726
We've gotta
get out of here.

474
00:19:21,261 --> 00:19:22,262
This is going to be
exponentially bigger
than what we just felt.

475
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,697
The entire grid
is going to fall.

477
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,670
I'm gonna go get her.
No, wait. I'll get her.

to get out of the city.

enough time or fuel

482
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,611
To get you and her.

what I was gonna say.

the same thing.

We've got our team live

the next time

526
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:25,184
I'll be able to get
to a landline or how
long they'll last,

527
00:21:26,052 --> 00:21:26,786
So you have
to listen to me.

528
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,322
We have got to enact
a level-four evac.

529
00:21:29,522 --> 00:21:31,358
This is
going to be big,

530
00:21:31,558 --> 00:21:33,360
Upwards of a M10,
Chet!

531
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,395
Molly, Molly, please.

532
00:21:35,595 --> 00:21:38,465
My system works, Chet.
It knew about Malibu

533
00:21:38,665 --> 00:21:40,433
Four minutes
before it happened.

534
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:41,868
Molly...
And now I'm showing

535
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:44,637
No fewer
than 18 right lateral
strike-slip warnings

536
00:21:44,837 --> 00:21:46,305
On 19 of my units

537
00:21:47,607 --> 00:21:49,576
Up and down
all 800 miles of
the San Andreas, Chet.

538
00:21:49,776 --> 00:21:51,744
Yeah, and in 2008,
you said the same thing.

539
00:21:51,944 --> 00:21:53,813
Only, it turned out
to be dune buggies
and high wind.

540
00:21:54,013 --> 00:21:55,848
That was eight million
lines of code,

541
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:57,584
Chet, your code!

542
00:21:57,784 --> 00:21:59,619
These are new rigs,
new code,

543
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:00,920
And it's working!

544
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,855
A level-four evac, Molly?

545
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:05,358
You have any idea
what I'd have to do?

546
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:08,027
Will you just look
at my data? Please?

547
00:22:09,095 --> 00:22:10,563
All right, fine.

548
00:22:10,763 --> 00:22:12,732
Send it over to me.
I'll take a look at it.

549
00:22:12,932 --> 00:22:14,434
I did! Check your inbox.

550
00:22:15,802 --> 00:22:16,536
We have got
to pull the trigger
on this evac protocol.

551
00:22:17,637 --> 00:22:19,005
You want me to evacuate
13 million people

552
00:22:20,206 --> 00:22:21,741
Because your science project
made a lucky guess?

553
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:23,543
That's not good science.
It's...

554
00:22:23,743 --> 00:22:26,679
An M10, Chet.
Listen to me.

555
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:28,981
I... I gotta go.

556
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,850
There will be
minor aftershocks,

557
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:32,251
But if any do occur,

558
00:22:32,452 --> 00:22:35,555
The frequency of these events
should taper off quickly.

559
00:22:35,755 --> 00:22:37,590
[Slams receiver]
Damn it.

560
00:22:47,567 --> 00:22:50,870
Oh, no, no, no!

561
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:51,971
Professor Dunn?
Shit.

562
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:53,906
Nick, I'm sorry
about earlier,

563
00:22:54,841 --> 00:22:55,675
And I'm sorry
about the grade,

564
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:56,943
But I really don't have
time for this right now.

565
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:57,777
No, no. How's Ali?
Huh?

566
00:22:58,411 --> 00:22:59,512
Ali. Is she okay?

567
00:23:00,146 --> 00:23:00,547
Yeah, she's fine.

568
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:01,714
I can't
get ahold of her.

569
00:23:02,582 --> 00:23:02,882
Did she leave
the hotel yet?

570
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:05,585
She's so stubborn.

571
00:23:05,785 --> 00:23:07,854
You're Ali's boyfriend.

572
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:09,489
I wanted to be
up-front about it.

573
00:23:09,689 --> 00:23:10,890
She made me swear
not to tell.

574
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,625
She said
you'd disapprove.

575
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:15,127
Yeah, she's right.
Excuse me.

576
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:16,395
Are you gonna
go get her?

577
00:23:16,596 --> 00:23:17,630
I am.

578
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,566
You need a car, right?

579
00:23:19,766 --> 00:23:21,400
Yes, I will.

580
00:23:21,601 --> 00:23:23,436
We can use mine.
"We"?

581
00:23:23,636 --> 00:23:24,904
Or I can go on my own.

582
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,607
If you think you can
get there before me,
be my guest.

583
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:29,842
All right,
where's your car?

584
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:31,444
Over here.

585
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:36,783
Oh, you can't
be serious.

586
00:23:36,983 --> 00:23:38,117
She'll get us there.

587
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:43,590
All right. Take PCH.

588
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,825
We should stay off
the elevated freeways.

589
00:23:53,733 --> 00:23:54,934
Uh...

590
00:23:55,134 --> 00:23:56,536
Yeah, just go.

591
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:13,986
[Sirens blaring]

592
00:24:17,323 --> 00:24:19,792
Lobby looks good.
I see no damage here,

593
00:24:19,992 --> 00:24:22,495
Not even a crack.
Meet me in the ballroom.

594
00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:25,565
Uh, that was
quite a little shaker
we had there.

595
00:24:25,765 --> 00:24:27,767
Um, is everything
looking okay? I mean...

596
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:29,502
Yeah, that's actually
pretty old.

597
00:24:29,702 --> 00:24:30,637
It's nothing new.

598
00:24:31,538 --> 00:24:31,904
Everything's
checking out fine.

599
00:24:34,941 --> 00:24:36,976
Whoo-hoo! [Chuckles]

600
00:24:38,711 --> 00:24:41,113
Oh, the technology today.

601
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:45,818
When I was a kid,
it was a real luxury
to have your picture taken.

602
00:24:46,018 --> 00:24:51,824
I've had more pictures taken
in the last five years
than my entire life.

603
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:53,092
Say cheese.

604
00:24:54,393 --> 00:24:55,795
You'll send that to us?

605
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:56,963
Of course.

606
00:24:58,397 --> 00:25:00,700
Oh, is dear
Mr. Dittmann around?

607
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,168
No, at a conference,

608
00:25:03,402 --> 00:25:05,638
But I'm sure
he'll be happy
to see you tomorrow.

609
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:06,639
Wonderful.

610
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:15,247
I'll radio you when
the dim sum's here.

611
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:16,683
Okay.

612
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,552
Is this thing safe
so soon after a quake?

613
00:25:19,752 --> 00:25:22,254
Sure thing. It's
been retrofitted
up to an 8.0.

614
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:25,558
All right, well,
too out of shape
to take the stairs then.

615
00:25:25,758 --> 00:25:27,594
All right. 14th floor.

616
00:25:27,794 --> 00:25:29,896
I hope this thing
can make it.

617
00:25:30,096 --> 00:25:31,163
Oh, it's perfectly safe.

618
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:43,910
Okay. Uh, Hank, Ali,

619
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,845
I've tried
calling and texting,

620
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:47,914
And this is
the only other way

621
00:25:48,114 --> 00:25:50,182
I could think to get
a message to you both.

622
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,051
2,000 hideous,
fake, metal palm trees

623
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,321
Disguised as cell towers
all over the entire
Los Angeles area,

624
00:25:55,521 --> 00:25:58,024
And I can't even make
a single phone call.

625
00:25:58,224 --> 00:25:59,926
All right.
Well, here's the plan.

626
00:26:00,126 --> 00:26:01,260
I'm coming downtown.

627
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,029
Ali, I know about Nick,

628
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:05,765
And he's with me
coming to get you.

629
00:26:06,933 --> 00:26:09,001
We just got a glimpse
from up high

630
00:26:09,201 --> 00:26:10,970
Of the entire
San Gabriel basin,

631
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:13,973
And there are
fires and smoke

632
00:26:14,173 --> 00:26:15,174
And helicopters.

633
00:26:15,374 --> 00:26:16,809
Angry people panicked.

634
00:26:18,044 --> 00:26:20,046
Ali, if you're getting this,
please just stay put.

635
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:22,314
Stay in the hotel.

636
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:23,315
It looks like the duration

637
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:24,851
Between foreshocks
is decreasing,

638
00:26:25,818 --> 00:26:26,853
Which means
that The Big, Big One

639
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:29,956
Might actually hit sooner than
my prediction model suggested.

640
00:26:30,156 --> 00:26:31,891
I can't be sure
until I get

641
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:34,093
Some sort of GPS or cellular
to cross-reference

642
00:26:34,293 --> 00:26:35,695
The seismic
or the geological data

643
00:26:36,863 --> 00:26:37,964
From all the sources
on and off the continent,

644
00:26:39,131 --> 00:26:40,332
But forget about all that.
Just stay put, Ali.

645
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,268
If you're getting this,
stay put.

646
00:26:43,002 --> 00:26:44,070
We're coming to get you.

647
00:26:45,037 --> 00:26:46,605
It is getting
very crazy out here.

648
00:26:58,851 --> 00:27:01,253
[Beeps]

649
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:04,156
According to this,
we're about to have
another minor trembler.

650
00:27:04,356 --> 00:27:05,357
What's minor?

651
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:06,926
M3 or 4.

652
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:09,228
We might not even feel it,
though, in a moving...

653
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:28,114
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no!

You okay?

658
00:28:03,249 --> 00:28:04,683
Yeah.

659
00:28:09,488 --> 00:28:11,390

660
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:13,225
[Warning chimes]
Aw, man.

661
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,837
I told you so.
I knew it.

662
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:26,739
I'm sorry.

663
00:28:26,939 --> 00:28:28,340
All right,
get me out of here.

664
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,076
Don't worry, hon.
Don't worry.

665
00:28:30,276 --> 00:28:32,344
This contraption
has lasted 100 years.

666
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:35,815
That means
it's... it's strong,
not weak.

667
00:28:36,015 --> 00:28:37,016
Ohh! Ahh!

668
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:37,950
Are you okay,
Mr. Lowenstein?

669
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:40,186
My heart.
Oh, what's wrong?

670
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:41,788
Sweetheart,
Where's your medication?

671
00:28:41,988 --> 00:28:44,390
Nightstand.
Where do you think?

672
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,492
Oh, he left his medicine
on the nightstand.

673
00:28:46,692 --> 00:28:48,861
Why would you
leave it there?

674
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:49,896
[Groans]
Hello?

675
00:28:50,096 --> 00:28:50,897

God, please get
this door open, please!

This is Bell Four Delta Chaz
requesting landing.

680
00:29:14,153 --> 00:29:15,922
We've been rerouted
due to the earthquake.

681
00:29:16,122 --> 00:29:17,456
Roger that, Bell Four.
Affirmative.

682
00:29:17,656 --> 00:29:19,458
Be advised
it's chaotic down here.

683
00:29:19,658 --> 00:29:20,459
Proceed with caution.

688
00:29:31,237 --> 00:29:32,004
The entire
infrastructure
must be hosed.

I'm missing
some packets.

690
00:29:34,373 --> 00:29:35,441
Maybe if we're lucky,
we'll get some...

A data signal or
a Wi-Fi or something.

692
00:29:38,177 --> 00:29:40,246
Oh, good.
I could use a latte.

00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:41,981
What are we gonna do?

695
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:44,783
Look at
the bright side.

[Birds squawking]

697
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,990
I can't believe
this is happening.

698
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:52,992
How are
we gonna get downtown?

699
00:29:53,192 --> 00:29:56,395
Damn it! Not my baby!

700
00:29:56,595 --> 00:29:57,864
Can you fix it?

701
00:29:58,064 --> 00:29:59,265
She's not going anywhere.

702
00:30:00,332 --> 00:30:01,968
What are we
gonna do now?

703
00:30:03,502 --> 00:30:05,004
I got us covered.

704
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:12,111
Bye, old girl.

705
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:13,345
Really?

706
00:30:18,117 --> 00:30:19,318
What are you doing?

707
00:30:19,518 --> 00:30:20,920
This van was my baby.

708
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,021
You don't remember
your first car?

709
00:30:22,221 --> 00:30:23,990
No.

710
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,391
You don't remember
your first car?

711
00:30:25,591 --> 00:30:27,026
No. Come on.
Let's go.

712
00:30:27,226 --> 00:30:28,427
Ali said that about you.

713
00:30:28,627 --> 00:30:30,329
What?
Nothing.

714
00:30:31,463 --> 00:30:32,865
Let me
just grab something.

715
00:30:33,065 --> 00:30:35,134
Well, please hurry.

716
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,176
Oh, my God,
Kerouac. Really?

717
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:46,112
No.

718
00:30:52,251 --> 00:30:53,185
What was that?

719
00:30:53,385 --> 00:30:54,453
Nothing. Let's go.

720
00:31:04,563 --> 00:31:05,965
I gave her this.

721
00:31:11,103 --> 00:31:12,204
Which one,
you think?

722
00:31:12,404 --> 00:31:14,206
We're going
to steal a car?

723
00:31:14,406 --> 00:31:16,442
Well, if you're right,
there's not gonna be
a car left anyways.

724
00:31:16,642 --> 00:31:17,576
What if
the owners need it?

725
00:31:17,776 --> 00:31:19,278
More than we need it?

726
00:31:19,478 --> 00:31:20,947
No, no, no, no! Don't!

727
00:31:21,147 --> 00:31:22,348
This one's unlocked.

728
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:25,017
Last thing we need
is a lacerated wrist.

729
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:26,385
Think before
you act, please.

730
00:31:26,585 --> 00:31:27,553
Yeah, yeah.

731
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:37,429
[Sparks crackle]

732
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:39,231
You know, if you're trying
to convince me you're

733
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:41,333
A good influence
on my stepdaughter,
it's not working.

734
00:31:42,801 --> 00:31:44,003
Look, I'm not
trying to convince you
of anything, all right?

735
00:31:44,203 --> 00:31:46,238
[Engine starts]

736
00:31:50,776 --> 00:31:51,910
All right.

737
00:32:00,052 --> 00:32:01,687
[Car horns honking]

738
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:05,457
[Echoing]
Help me!

739
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:07,093
Anyone!

740
00:32:07,293 --> 00:32:09,161
We're in the elevator!

741
00:32:09,361 --> 00:32:10,963
Sweetheart, sweetheart,
look at me.

742
00:32:11,163 --> 00:32:13,966
Look at me.
You're going to be
all right.

743
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:15,467
Cough. Cough.
It helps. Cough.

744
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:17,503
Take deep breaths,
Arnold.

745
00:32:17,703 --> 00:32:19,338
Arnie,
please don't leave me!

746
00:32:19,538 --> 00:32:21,440
Please stay with me.

747
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,542
Sir, sir, hand me
my purse, please.

748
00:32:23,742 --> 00:32:25,211
I think there's
some aspirin in it.

749
00:32:25,411 --> 00:32:27,046
I think it could help.

750
00:32:27,246 --> 00:32:29,948
* Let me call you
sweetheart *

751
00:32:30,149 --> 00:32:34,253
* I'm in love with you *

752
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,595
Damn it. The network
is completely down.

753
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:47,966
I have no idea how
that activity affected
the prediction model.

754
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:49,368
Take Canyon Road.

755
00:32:49,568 --> 00:32:52,138
Canyon Road?
That'll take forever.

756
00:32:52,338 --> 00:32:54,673
You think the freeways
are gonna be any faster?

757
00:32:54,873 --> 00:32:56,008
[Sighs]

758
00:32:59,378 --> 00:33:01,547
I just want you to know

759
00:33:01,747 --> 00:33:03,282
I'm not seeing
any other girls.

760
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:06,018
I thought you weren't
trying to convince me.

761
00:33:06,218 --> 00:33:07,686
I'm committed to Ali.

762
00:33:07,886 --> 00:33:09,488
Well, if you were
so committed to her,

763
00:33:09,688 --> 00:33:11,557
Why did you convince her
to drop out of school?

764
00:33:11,757 --> 00:33:13,292
What makes you think
that was my idea?

765
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:15,661
And that tattoo? I bet
that was your idea as well.

766
00:33:15,861 --> 00:33:17,663
God, you really
don't know Ali, do you?

767
00:33:17,863 --> 00:33:21,733
Look, she
dropped out of college
on her own, okay?

768
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:23,602
It was holding her back.

769
00:33:23,802 --> 00:33:26,072
She wants to be
an event planner,
not a biology major.

770
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:28,040
Obviously
I'm all for college.

771
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,509
It's why I'm there.
I need it.

772
00:33:30,709 --> 00:33:33,512
But she doesn't.
She can blaze
her own trail.

773
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,582
Thank you,
Jack Kerouac.

Stop the car!
What's wrong?

776
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:44,556
The bridge is closed.

777
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:45,624
What if they closed it

778
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:46,525
Because of
the earthquake?

779
00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:47,826
Oh, look at the cracks.

780
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:51,029
Should I turn around?

781
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,631
We don't have time.

782
00:33:52,831 --> 00:33:55,401
We're just
gonna have to drive
across it carefully.

783
00:33:55,601 --> 00:33:57,336
You wanna go over it?
Carefully.

784
00:33:57,536 --> 00:33:58,737
Like that's gonna
make us any lighter.

785
00:33:58,937 --> 00:34:00,806
Just drive down
the middle slowly.

786
00:34:16,355 --> 00:34:17,323
Ohh!

787
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:20,192
Okay.

788
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:21,460
We're okay.

789
00:34:27,333 --> 00:34:29,067
Oh, no.

790
00:34:29,268 --> 00:34:31,203

Okay.

a weak data signal.

I'm Ron Jantz,

831
00:36:25,951 --> 00:36:28,387
And we're bringing you
everything we know so far

832
00:36:28,587 --> 00:36:29,921
About the series
of earthquakes

833
00:36:31,323 --> 00:36:32,224
That have struck the greater
Los Angeles area this afternoon,

834
00:36:33,725 --> 00:36:35,894
Starting with
the 4.0-magnitude quake
off the coast of Malibu.

835
00:36:36,094 --> 00:36:37,429
Now here's what we know so far.

836
00:36:38,597 --> 00:36:39,898
Authorities are attempting
to dig out residents

837
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:42,501
In four residential blocks
near the intersection

838
00:36:43,735 --> 00:36:45,537
Of Temescal Canyon Road
and Pacific Coast Highway.

839
00:36:45,737 --> 00:36:47,906
Approximately 24 to 25 homes

Have been destroyed
by landslides

841
00:36:49,841 --> 00:36:52,778

a massive avalanche.

00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:57,249
That's an earthquake.
I'm under the table, folks.

844
00:36:57,449 --> 00:36:58,784
Please,
everybody head for cover.

845
00:36:58,984 --> 00:37:01,587
Everyone be safe.
This is serious. Please.

846
00:37:01,787 --> 00:37:03,322
Oh, this is not good.

00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:34,386
[Sirens blaring]

848
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:44,663
This can't be.

849
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:52,804
Excuse me, sir?
Dr. Michaels?

850
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:55,841
You are not
gonna believe this.

851
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:01,680
I been asking
for aftershock activity
since 1 A.M.,

852
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,948
Not worst-case
scenario models.

853
00:38:03,148 --> 00:38:04,383
Excuse me, sir.

854
00:38:04,583 --> 00:38:05,751
Wait a minute. Wait.

855
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:07,753
Yes.
What are these nodes?

856
00:38:07,953 --> 00:38:09,388
That's the activity
today.

857
00:38:09,588 --> 00:38:11,056
That there,
that's the 5.0

858
00:38:11,256 --> 00:38:12,458
From 30 minutes ago,
right?

859
00:38:13,759 --> 00:38:15,427
This is Molly Dunn's
prediction data.

860
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:17,729
It's a confirmation of
the slip-strike events.

861
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:20,499
It's a near
perfect match with
the recorded live data.

862
00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:23,802
The readings,
they're going
well into tonight,

863
00:38:24,002 --> 00:38:26,037
And they're topping
over an M10.

864
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:27,773
And you've cross-checked
all this?

865
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:29,841
Three times.
So did Jenkins.

866
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:31,577
Sir, those are
not aftershocks.

867
00:38:31,777 --> 00:38:33,078
They're foreshocks.

868
00:38:33,278 --> 00:38:35,647
Henry, get me
the Governor's office!

869
00:38:41,453 --> 00:38:44,322

now just joining us,

For the entire city
of Los Angeles.

872

Now this includes all
of the outlying areas.

00:38:50,128 --> 00:38:53,331
I repeat,

the entire city of Los Angeles

00:38:57,869 --> 00:38:59,538
The evacuation is mandatory.

877
00:38:59,738 --> 00:39:00,872
The magnitude
of the next quake

878
00:39:01,973 --> 00:39:03,074
Is expected to exceed
the tolerance levels

879
00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:06,344
Of most, if not all,
of the area's infrastructure.

880
00:39:06,545 --> 00:39:07,979
Now we do have
confirmed estimates

881
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,015
Out of the United States
Geological Survey

882
00:39:10,215 --> 00:39:12,618
Putting the expected quake
at a 10.0.

883
00:39:12,818 --> 00:39:14,720
An evacuation order
has been issued

884
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,121
For all
of Southern California.

885
00:39:16,321 --> 00:39:17,556
Come on! Come on!
Let's go!

886
00:39:27,132 --> 00:39:27,899
TOWER: Citation 223...
Damn it.

887
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:30,035
Hold your position!
Any luck?

888
00:39:30,235 --> 00:39:31,837
Traffic on the runway!
No.

889
00:39:32,037 --> 00:39:33,939
Look, since we're
still paying for this,

890
00:39:34,139 --> 00:39:35,574
We need you
to take us to Pasadena.

891
00:39:35,774 --> 00:39:36,742
What? No.

892
00:39:37,776 --> 00:39:38,410
Pasadena is
not gonna be
any safer.

893
00:39:39,077 --> 00:39:40,712
No. To get our baby.

894
00:39:40,912 --> 00:39:43,749
Hey, look, I got
my own wife and
kid to worry about.

895
00:39:43,949 --> 00:39:44,816
They're relying
on me.

896
00:39:45,751 --> 00:39:46,384
But you said
they were downtown.

897
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:47,586
This is on the way.

898
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:48,587
Actually, it's not.
From Malibu,

899
00:39:49,521 --> 00:39:50,388
First is downtown,
then Pasadena.

900
00:39:51,557 --> 00:39:51,957
Well, we have
a signed agreement
with you.

901
00:39:56,061 --> 00:39:58,029
As soon as we
fuel up the chopper,
we'll take...

902
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,665
This is our charter.

903
00:39:59,865 --> 00:40:01,700
Look, lady, you heard
of force majeure?

904
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,735
This is about
as force majeured
as you can get.

905
00:40:04,803 --> 00:40:06,137
Hold on!

906
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:08,406
Look, honey,
we'll be okay.

907
00:40:11,777 --> 00:40:13,912
No!
No!

908
00:40:25,791 --> 00:40:27,759
Hey, hey, hey, fella,
I'm glad to see you.

909
00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:28,894
We need
to rent a chopper.

910
00:40:29,795 --> 00:40:30,629
Sorry, man.
Everything's gone.

911
00:40:31,963 --> 00:40:32,664
As soon as I swap
out this starter,
I'm outta here.

912
00:40:33,965 --> 00:40:34,833
I wish I could
help you, but it's
only a two-seater.

913
00:40:36,034 --> 00:40:36,702
Come on. There's gotta be
something we can rent.

914
00:40:37,603 --> 00:40:38,169
Anything!
What about that one?

915
00:40:39,037 --> 00:40:40,739
Please, sir,
that old relic?

916
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:42,608
You won't get it
two feet off the ground

917
00:40:42,808 --> 00:40:43,709
Without
a new rotor pin.

918
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:45,076
Can't you please
fix it for us?

919
00:40:46,211 --> 00:40:47,713
Look, I gotta
get outta here,
all right?

920
00:40:47,913 --> 00:40:49,080
They're saying
this whole valley

921
00:40:50,315 --> 00:40:51,082
Will be underwater
by the time
this quake hits.

922
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:52,183
Look,

923
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:53,585
I'm begging you.

924
00:40:54,653 --> 00:40:56,087
My wife and daughter
are depending on me.

925
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,490
Sorry, man.
It's every man
for himself.

926
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:00,091
5,000.

927
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:02,060
What?

928
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,763
I will pay you
5,000 bucks to fix it.

929
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:09,501
I don't know. I'd have
to weld a makeshift piece.

930
00:41:09,701 --> 00:41:10,502
I-I'm not sure.

931
00:41:10,702 --> 00:41:11,803

Uh...

933
00:41:15,607 --> 00:41:18,009
I will do my best.
No promises.

934
00:41:21,279 --> 00:41:24,650
On one condition.
We get my baby first.

935
00:41:27,686 --> 00:41:29,220
Okay, listen. Um...

936
00:41:30,722 --> 00:41:32,624
We have tried a couple
of different routes,

937
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:34,492
And they are no good.

938
00:41:34,693 --> 00:41:38,096
Hank, if you can see a route
and get a text out to us,

939
00:41:38,296 --> 00:41:41,700
Anything,
we sure would appreciate it.

940
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:45,036
Um, we're gonna keep trying.

941
00:41:46,104 --> 00:41:47,138
I'll see you soon.

Yeah.

Hello? Hello?
Get me outta here!

Thank God!
Open the door!

I'm doing?

Help me pry
this door open.

now just joining us...

know which one.

for the entire city

of its outlying areas.

is strongly urged,

of this quake
is expected...

We've got
to get out of here.

976
00:43:48,059 --> 00:43:50,729
You said this place
can handle an 8.0?

977
00:43:50,929 --> 00:43:51,997
We gotta go, like, now!

978
00:43:52,197 --> 00:43:54,299
Wait! Please,
we need your help.

Yeah. Go ahead.

I just got word
the National Guard

Wants us all
on an evacuation bus
in 30 minutes.

984
00:44:04,609 --> 00:44:06,277
They can only fit,
like, 100 people.

985
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:07,278
Okay. We're coming.

00:44:09,314 --> 00:44:11,750

I promise you
we'll make it.

take that chance.

00:44:18,289 --> 00:44:19,725
Fine.

991
00:44:19,925 --> 00:44:21,693
But if we don't
make it on that bus,

992
00:44:21,893 --> 00:44:23,361
There's gonna
be hell to pay.

993
00:44:24,796 --> 00:44:25,731
Come on.

994
00:44:28,366 --> 00:44:30,135

about Canyon Road.

Oh, where are we?

1002
00:45:26,925 --> 00:45:28,259
It's a shortcut
through Griffith Park,

1003
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:29,260
Behind the zoo.

1004
00:45:31,196 --> 00:45:33,464
I hate to admit it,
but I'm really glad
you came along.

Wow.

1006
00:45:38,269 --> 00:45:39,404
Ali never listens to me.

Oh, if you think
she listens to
everything I say,

1008

You got
another think coming.

1009
00:45:44,275 --> 00:45:45,343
She just
crosses her arms
and says fine

1010
00:45:46,477 --> 00:45:48,146
And then does whatever
she was doing anyways.

1011
00:45:48,346 --> 00:45:49,881

a slammed door.

Ah, I had that.
You know,

00:45:53,952 --> 00:45:54,019
I signed her up for
self-defense classes.

1015
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:56,187
I told her
New York could be
a dangerous place.

Huh? Wait. What?

1017

she was gonna tell you.

to live there?

taking her, okay?

00:47:29,981 --> 00:47:30,982
[Screams]

1052
00:47:33,251 --> 00:47:35,120
Hey! Hey!

1053
00:47:36,221 --> 00:47:37,322
Wait!

1054
00:47:39,624 --> 00:47:41,159
Wait! Stop!

1055
00:47:42,293 --> 00:47:43,494
Come on!

1056
00:47:48,099 --> 00:47:49,034
[Grunts]

1057
00:47:56,474 --> 00:47:58,109
Come on! Let's go!

1058
00:47:59,644 --> 00:48:01,146
Drive! Drive! Drive!

1059
00:48:07,285 --> 00:48:08,219
Whew!

1060
00:48:08,419 --> 00:48:10,421
Yeah,
definitely not dead.

1061
00:48:10,621 --> 00:48:11,556
Yeah, I figured.

1062
00:48:12,557 --> 00:48:13,291
Must have escaped
from the zoo, huh?

1063
00:48:13,491 --> 00:48:14,292
Yeah.

1064
00:48:14,492 --> 00:48:15,460
Yeah.

1065
00:48:17,362 --> 00:48:18,663
[Grunts]

1066
00:48:20,798 --> 00:48:23,434
All the animals
can feel it coming.

1067
00:48:23,634 --> 00:48:26,137
This is gonna be
bigger than anything
we've ever seen.

1068
00:48:27,705 --> 00:48:29,374
We might not
make it out, you know.

1069
00:48:33,678 --> 00:48:35,280
Yeah.

1070
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:55,300
I'm Edna,
Edna Lowenstein.

1071
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:58,669
Uh, Kaplin,
Miles Kaplin.

1072
00:48:58,869 --> 00:49:00,305
Oh, well, Miles,

1073
00:49:00,505 --> 00:49:02,073
Thank you so much.
Yeah.

1074
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:05,010
Consider this
your good deed
for the day.

1075
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:10,681
Ah, well, no good deed
goes unpunished,
as they say.

1076
00:49:10,881 --> 00:49:13,151
I-It's my anniversary.

1077
00:49:13,351 --> 00:49:16,687
If this is
how much the Earth
moves on our 40th,

1078
00:49:16,887 --> 00:49:20,158
Think of what
it'll do on our 50th.

1079
00:49:20,358 --> 00:49:22,193
Sir, could you help us?

1080
00:49:22,393 --> 00:49:23,494
Hey!
We have a sick man!

1081
00:49:23,694 --> 00:49:25,063
Hey! Hey!

1082
00:49:26,264 --> 00:49:28,099
Um, okay,

1083
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:30,368
Maybe we should
pick up the pace
a little bit, huh?

1084
00:49:30,568 --> 00:49:32,503
[Sirens blaring outside]
Sweetheart.

1085
00:49:32,703 --> 00:49:34,239
All right, come on!
Come on.

1086
00:49:35,306 --> 00:49:38,076
Arnie? Oh, darling.

1087
00:49:51,589 --> 00:49:53,058
Good afternoon, everyone.

1088
00:49:53,258 --> 00:49:56,027
I'm Ron Jantz,
and this is 10 Action News

1089
00:49:56,227 --> 00:49:57,462
With the latest on...

1090
00:49:58,696 --> 00:50:00,231
Really the only way
to describe this situation now

1091
00:50:00,431 --> 00:50:01,999
Is as a swarm of earthquakes,

1092
00:50:03,434 --> 00:50:05,103
A swarm of ever more violent,
ever more stronger earthquakes.

1093
00:50:05,303 --> 00:50:06,771
I just don't know
how else to put it.

1094
00:50:06,971 --> 00:50:08,206
We're doing our best

1095
00:50:09,307 --> 00:50:10,508
To keep our broadcast
on the air for you.

1096
00:50:11,876 --> 00:50:13,444
Now, we just had to switch over
to our diesel generators.

1097
00:50:13,644 --> 00:50:15,180
For those of you
just joining us,

1098
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:17,148
An evacuation order
has been issued for all...

1099
00:50:17,348 --> 00:50:19,217
I think we're
the only idiots
driving into town.

1100
00:50:19,417 --> 00:50:21,386
Shh!
Routes going into
the downtown area

1101
00:50:21,586 --> 00:50:23,388
Have been blocked
by the National Guard,

1102
00:50:23,588 --> 00:50:26,724
And both sides of the 10 Freeway
are now flowing east.

1103
00:50:26,924 --> 00:50:30,695
Everyone is urged to get out
and get out now.

1104
00:50:30,895 --> 00:50:32,497
Oh, please
let her be all right.

1105
00:50:32,697 --> 00:50:34,031
She will be.

1106
00:50:34,232 --> 00:50:35,366
The MTA has announced

1107
00:50:35,566 --> 00:50:37,735
The suspension
of all subway services,

1108
00:50:37,935 --> 00:50:41,772
But buses are taking people east
of the San Andreas fault line.

1109
00:50:41,972 --> 00:50:44,142
I repeat,
a general evacuation order

1110
00:50:44,342 --> 00:50:46,177
Has been issued
for the entire city
of Los Angeles...

1111
00:50:46,377 --> 00:50:49,114
I didn't even know
she wanted to be
an event planner.

1112
00:50:49,314 --> 00:50:52,183
I feel like I've
spent the last six years
trying to get to know her,

1113
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:54,085
And some kid
with a rap sheet
comes along,

1114
00:50:54,285 --> 00:50:55,286
And she
just spills her guts.

1115
00:50:57,355 --> 00:50:59,490
It's part of being
a parent, I guess.

1116
00:51:00,758 --> 00:51:02,160
Your mother know you?

1117
00:51:03,228 --> 00:51:04,562
My mom probably assumes

1118
00:51:04,762 --> 00:51:05,563
I'm in jail...

1119
00:51:06,964 --> 00:51:10,568
And my dad is M.I.A.

1120
00:51:10,768 --> 00:51:13,638
My mom kind of
just checked out,

1121
00:51:13,838 --> 00:51:16,407
So I hooked up
with a tough crowd.

1122
00:51:19,377 --> 00:51:20,411
I didn't know that.

1123
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:24,081
That's why I've sunk
everything into college.

1124
00:51:24,282 --> 00:51:26,083
Just hoping I can
turn everything around.

1125
00:51:27,952 --> 00:51:29,454
You know I can't
change your grade

1126
00:51:29,654 --> 00:51:30,521
Because of
a sob story, though.

1127
00:51:30,721 --> 00:51:32,557
Hey, I'm not asking
for that, okay?

1128
00:51:32,757 --> 00:51:34,392
I'm just asking
that you treat me

1129
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:36,127
Like I'm someone
that belongs there,

1130
00:51:37,462 --> 00:51:38,529
Not like I'm some loser
that just walked
into class.

1131
00:51:40,298 --> 00:51:42,633
You really think
I'd care so much
about a grade

1132
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:43,868
If I wasn't
being serious?

1133
00:51:46,537 --> 00:51:49,640
Okay. If the college
is still standing

1134
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:52,310
After all of this,
you've got a deal.

1135
00:51:53,411 --> 00:51:54,612
And same thing
with Ali, okay?

1136
00:51:54,812 --> 00:51:56,447
I won't lie.
I've put up the numbers.

1137
00:51:56,647 --> 00:51:58,283
Don't need to hear that.

1138
00:51:58,483 --> 00:51:59,284
No, look.

1139
00:52:00,551 --> 00:52:03,521
She's exactly
what I need, okay?

1140
00:52:03,721 --> 00:52:05,390
I want to be the guy
she deserves.

1141
00:52:06,457 --> 00:52:07,592
That's what drives me.

1142
00:52:09,394 --> 00:52:11,128
That's sweet,

1143
00:52:11,329 --> 00:52:12,630
But just so you know...

1144
00:52:13,931 --> 00:52:15,533
She's my daughter,

1145
00:52:15,733 --> 00:52:17,735
And I don't care much
what she does for you.

1146
00:52:17,935 --> 00:52:19,204
I care
what you do for her.

1147
00:52:20,538 --> 00:52:21,539
WOMAN: Please stop!

1148
00:52:21,739 --> 00:52:23,508
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Stop!

1149
00:52:23,708 --> 00:52:24,775
Please stop!

1150
00:52:25,843 --> 00:52:26,644
Oh, Nick, I don't
think we should stop.

1151
00:52:28,078 --> 00:52:29,580
Nick, please,
we don't have much time
left to get to Ali.

1152
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:30,715
Everything okay?

1153
00:52:32,783 --> 00:52:34,719
I am so sorry
to stop you like that,

1154
00:52:34,919 --> 00:52:37,788
But no one will stop.
I tried calling AAA,

1155
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:40,858
And all you get
is this recording saying
that nobody's available.

1156
00:52:41,058 --> 00:52:42,293
Okay, so you got
some car troubles?

1157
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:43,861
Yeah.
All right.

1158
00:52:44,061 --> 00:52:45,730
We had a giraffe
trample over our car.

1159
00:52:46,797 --> 00:52:47,765
We gotta go,
all right?

1160
00:52:47,965 --> 00:52:48,866
Let's get
you outta here.

1161
00:52:49,834 --> 00:52:49,900
Why are you guys
heading that way?

1162
00:52:50,535 --> 00:52:51,336
You gotta get out.

1163
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:52,603
My girlfriend's
downtown.

1164
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:54,472
Oh, honey, you're never
gonna make that.

1165
00:52:55,139 --> 00:52:55,873
Well, we gotta try.

1166
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:58,175
No, no, no, no, no.
You gotta listen to me.

1167
00:52:59,109 --> 00:52:59,510
Why are you
heading up that way?

1168
00:53:00,411 --> 00:53:00,745
How many miles
you got on this?

1169
00:53:01,312 --> 00:53:02,179
About 100,000.

1170
00:53:03,214 --> 00:53:04,181
Can you start the car
for me, please?

1171
00:53:05,316 --> 00:53:07,785
[Engine grinding]

1172
00:53:07,985 --> 00:53:09,320
Okay, you can
turn it off.

1173
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,322
[Sighs] Yeah,
I can't fix this.

1174
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:13,491
Oh, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

1175
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:15,693
No, it's cool.
We got room in our car.
You can come with us.

1176
00:53:15,893 --> 00:53:18,563
We don't have time
to go downtown.

1177
00:53:18,763 --> 00:53:20,298
Please, there's roadblocks.
It's suicide.

1178
00:53:20,498 --> 00:53:21,732
Well, we gotta try,
okay?

1179
00:53:21,932 --> 00:53:23,468
We got the room.
You can come along.

1180
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:30,308
No, Mom! No.

1181
00:53:30,508 --> 00:53:31,809
Mom!
Whoa!

1182
00:53:32,009 --> 00:53:33,344
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Whoa.

1183
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:34,412
We have
to get out now!

1184
00:53:34,612 --> 00:53:35,380
God damn it.

1185
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:37,848
My daughter
is all I've got...

1186
00:53:38,983 --> 00:53:39,917
And we
don't have time

1187
00:53:40,117 --> 00:53:41,452
To go downtown.

1188
00:53:42,553 --> 00:53:44,522
I have to get
my baby out,
so let's go.

1189
00:53:44,722 --> 00:53:46,791
I gotta save
my baby, too, okay?
I can't leave her!

1190
00:53:46,991 --> 00:53:49,226
We got a helicopter on top
of a building down there!

1191
00:53:49,427 --> 00:53:50,895
We have to get out now!

1192
00:53:52,330 --> 00:53:54,332
Have you not been
listening to what they
have been saying?

1193
00:53:54,532 --> 00:53:55,733
I can't leave her.

1194
00:53:57,101 --> 00:53:58,769
Is that
your final word?

1195
00:54:01,038 --> 00:54:02,573
[Laughs]

1196
00:54:02,773 --> 00:54:04,675
Okay, you,
whoever you are,

1197
00:54:04,875 --> 00:54:06,377
I'm gonna shoot
this nice young man

1198
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:08,279
If you don't give me
those car keys.

1199
00:54:08,479 --> 00:54:09,614
No, Mom, don't!
Sarah!

1200
00:54:09,814 --> 00:54:11,316
There are no keys.
What?

1201
00:54:11,516 --> 00:54:12,717
I hot-wired the car!
Mama, please.

1202
00:54:12,917 --> 00:54:14,352
What?
Ma'am, we are willing

1203
00:54:14,552 --> 00:54:15,720
To take you wherever
you wanna go...

1204
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:16,954
No, Mrs. Dunn, it's okay.
No, it's okay,

1205
00:54:17,154 --> 00:54:18,756
All right?
Just... Just go get Ali!

1206
00:54:18,956 --> 00:54:20,257
That's what's important
right now!

1207
00:54:20,458 --> 00:54:21,292
You better not!

1208
00:54:22,192 --> 00:54:22,893
Just tell her
I love her! Go!

1209
00:54:23,961 --> 00:54:26,431
Mom?
I will shoot him.

1210
00:54:26,631 --> 00:54:27,765
No.

1211
00:54:28,999 --> 00:54:31,536
I mean it.
I'm going to shoot him!

1212
00:54:31,736 --> 00:54:34,004
Mom!
I mean it, Sarah!

1213
00:54:34,204 --> 00:54:36,607
I'll shoot.
She's my baby!
I'll shoot!

1214
00:54:36,807 --> 00:54:38,509
No! Ahh!

1215
00:54:38,709 --> 00:54:40,277
No! No!
You...

1216
00:54:40,478 --> 00:54:41,679
Don't!
Just take it!

1217
00:54:41,879 --> 00:54:42,947
Just take it!
Just take it!

1218
00:54:43,147 --> 00:54:44,349
Get the hell
out of here!

1219
00:54:58,763 --> 00:55:00,297
I told you go to.

1220
00:55:00,498 --> 00:55:02,633
And I told you we
shouldn't have stopped.

1221
00:55:05,736 --> 00:55:07,572
JANTZ: The National Guard
has closed down

1222
00:55:07,772 --> 00:55:09,840
All access
into downtown Los Angeles.

1223
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,977
All traffic on the 10 Freeway
is now eastbound.

1224
00:55:13,177 --> 00:55:14,845
There is no westbound traffic.

1225
00:55:15,045 --> 00:55:17,047
You cannot get
to downtown Los Angeles.

1226
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:19,684
The governor has declared
a state of martial law,

1227
00:55:19,884 --> 00:55:20,985
And anyone caught trying

1228
00:55:22,119 --> 00:55:23,320
To get into downtown L.A.
will be arrested.

1229
00:55:25,089 --> 00:55:26,691
Shit,
they're getting closer.

1230
00:55:26,891 --> 00:55:27,958
What do you mean?

1231
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:30,561
What are you doing?

1232
00:55:30,761 --> 00:55:31,829
Seeing how much time
we have left.

1233
00:55:32,029 --> 00:55:32,963
You got a signal?

1234
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:35,332
A faint data signal.

1235
00:55:35,533 --> 00:55:36,601
But, shit, my battery.

1236
00:55:36,801 --> 00:55:38,403
Oh. I have a backup.

1237
00:55:41,071 --> 00:55:42,873
Thanks.

1238
00:55:43,073 --> 00:55:43,874
Oh, no.

1239
00:55:44,074 --> 00:55:45,009
No. Damn it!

1240
00:55:45,209 --> 00:55:46,711
No, no. Shit.
What is it?

1241
00:55:46,911 --> 00:55:47,912
No.
What is it?

1242
00:55:48,979 --> 00:55:51,416
This thing that
I wanted to give to Ali.

1243
00:55:51,616 --> 00:55:52,617
She loved it.

1244
00:55:52,817 --> 00:55:53,784
What was it?

1245
00:55:53,984 --> 00:55:54,819
Ferdinand.

1246
00:55:55,019 --> 00:55:56,454
Who?
Ferdinand.

1247
00:55:56,654 --> 00:55:58,589
This stupid duck.

1248
00:55:58,789 --> 00:55:59,624
Damn it!

1249
00:55:59,824 --> 00:56:00,891
You okay?

1250
00:56:01,091 --> 00:56:01,959
Yeah. It's stupid.

1251
00:56:03,093 --> 00:56:05,062
[Beeping]

1252
00:56:05,262 --> 00:56:06,564
Oh, this can't
be right.

1253
00:56:06,764 --> 00:56:07,732
What?

1254
00:56:07,932 --> 00:56:08,799
Updated estimate.

1255
00:56:10,635 --> 00:56:12,803
It's gonna be bigger
than we thought.

1256
00:56:13,003 --> 00:56:14,505
It's saying a 12.0.

1257
00:56:15,906 --> 00:56:17,942
Nothing's gonna be
left standing.

1258
00:56:18,142 --> 00:56:19,444
So we better get going.

1259
00:56:20,545 --> 00:56:21,779
Yeah.

1260
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:34,759
The quake that hit L.A.
earlier today

1261
00:56:34,959 --> 00:56:36,093
Measured at 5.3

1262
00:56:37,294 --> 00:56:39,163
According to the United States
Geological Survey.

1263
00:56:39,363 --> 00:56:41,899
That quake was followed
by several strong tremors.

1264
00:56:42,099 --> 00:56:44,001
One of them, we believe,
was another quake.

1265
00:56:44,201 --> 00:56:46,537
There was some damage
to some buildings and homes,

1266
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:47,972
But nothing like the one

1267
00:56:48,172 --> 00:56:50,641
That's about to hit
in roughly 60 minutes.

1268
00:57:04,154 --> 00:57:05,656
[Gasping]

1269
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:32,483
109. 110.

1270
00:57:32,683 --> 00:57:33,484
MILES: Wait!
111.

1271
00:57:34,351 --> 00:57:34,418
[Radio]
No more! No more!

1272
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:35,352
We're stuffed
like sardines!

1273
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:36,186
Bus is full!
Copy that.

1274
00:57:36,921 --> 00:57:37,988
Sir, the bus
is full.

1275
00:57:38,422 --> 00:57:38,889
What?

1276
00:57:39,089 --> 00:57:40,725
Wait. Is there...

1277
00:57:40,925 --> 00:57:42,527
Is there
another bus coming?

1278
00:57:42,727 --> 00:57:43,928
I doubt it.
Next best option

1279
00:57:44,128 --> 00:57:45,530
Is a bomb shelter
on Flower.

1280
00:57:52,803 --> 00:57:56,106
A general evacuation has been
given to Los Angeles and all

1281
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:58,909
Of the surrounding outlying
areas. Pretty much anyone

1282
00:57:59,109 --> 00:58:02,046
West of the San Andreas
fault line must evacuate.

1283
00:58:02,246 --> 00:58:05,983
A major catastrophic earthquake
event has been predicted

1284
00:58:06,183 --> 00:58:09,620
To strike downtown
Los Angeles at any minute.

1285
00:58:13,658 --> 00:58:14,992
Shit!

1286
00:58:15,192 --> 00:58:16,026
They're
detaining people.

1287
00:58:17,161 --> 00:58:18,596
Hey, you guys
can't be here!

1288
00:58:18,796 --> 00:58:19,597
We're
evacuating!

1289
00:58:19,797 --> 00:58:20,765
Ah, we're so close.

1290
00:58:22,232 --> 00:58:23,868
What do we do?
What do we do?

1291
00:58:24,068 --> 00:58:24,869
Tunnels.

1292
00:58:28,305 --> 00:58:29,740
Sewer?
No, Prohibition tunnels.

1293
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:31,776
I used to run
all up and down them.

1294
00:58:31,976 --> 00:58:32,943
They're famous.
Okay, where?

1295
00:58:33,143 --> 00:58:34,845
Um, okay, follow me.
Okay.

1296
00:58:36,914 --> 00:58:38,616
The entrance
is over here!

1297
00:58:40,985 --> 00:58:43,788
What if your data is off
and it hits early?

1298
00:58:43,988 --> 00:58:45,556
Then we're
crushed alive. And?

1299
00:58:54,932 --> 00:58:57,067
The hotel is
about five blocks away.

1300
00:58:57,267 --> 00:58:58,936
The tunnel runs
right under it.

1301
00:59:00,204 --> 00:59:01,806
Keep moving.
Keep moving. Keep moving.

1302
00:59:04,742 --> 00:59:05,876
Careful for this wire.

1303
00:59:06,076 --> 00:59:07,845
Might have
some electricity in it.

1304
00:59:08,045 --> 00:59:09,179
This is crazy.

1305
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:11,548
You sure
you know your way
around down here?

1306
00:59:12,983 --> 00:59:14,919
Just trust me.
Watch your step.

1307
00:59:35,172 --> 00:59:37,574
No going back now anyway.
Let's go.

1308
00:59:40,044 --> 00:59:41,111
Whoa.

1309
00:59:42,312 --> 00:59:43,347
What?

1310
00:59:43,547 --> 00:59:44,348
Oh, no.

1311
00:59:45,115 --> 00:59:45,850
Oh, my God. What happened?

1312
00:59:46,817 --> 00:59:47,284
Well, he didn't
die in the quake.

1313
00:59:48,118 --> 00:59:48,653
There's no sign
of trauma.

1314
00:59:49,453 --> 00:59:50,087
Looks like
he just died.

1315
00:59:50,688 --> 00:59:51,656
What killed him?

1316
00:59:52,723 --> 00:59:54,659
Oh, no.

1317
00:59:54,859 --> 00:59:56,861
Same thing
that's corroding
this penny.

1318
00:59:58,395 --> 01:00:00,798
Hydrogen sulfide.

1319
01:00:00,998 --> 01:00:03,834
Earthquake must
have caused a leak.
[coughs]

1320
01:00:04,034 --> 01:00:05,803
This poor guy
must have been
just down here working

1321
01:00:06,003 --> 01:00:07,037
When he got overcome.

1322
01:00:07,237 --> 01:00:08,138
Is it explosive?

1323
01:00:08,338 --> 01:00:09,840
Very.
[coughing]

1324
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:11,108
That means...

1325
01:00:11,308 --> 01:00:13,110
We're in big trouble.
Come on.

1326
01:00:18,115 --> 01:00:20,050
[Both coughing]

1327
01:00:21,986 --> 01:00:23,620
I'm so dizzy.
Keep going!

1328
01:00:23,821 --> 01:00:24,855
Ah, careful!

1329
01:00:26,891 --> 01:00:28,125
Damn it.

1330
01:00:33,964 --> 01:00:36,300
[Both coughing]

1331
01:00:40,537 --> 01:00:43,808
Help me move this.
We've got to clear
an opening.

1332
01:00:48,212 --> 01:00:51,081
[Both coughing]

1333
01:00:51,281 --> 01:00:52,883
I'm gonna pass out.

1334
01:00:54,418 --> 01:00:55,820
I can't go on.

1335
01:00:56,020 --> 01:00:58,789
We've got to.
Help me.

1336
01:00:58,989 --> 01:01:00,357
Ah, I'm getting
so dizzy.

1337
01:01:02,459 --> 01:01:04,394
[Sirens blaring]

1338
01:01:08,165 --> 01:01:10,100
[Coughs]

1339
01:01:11,802 --> 01:01:13,938
Hey, Ali, this one's
just for you, kiddo.

1340
01:01:14,138 --> 01:01:15,740
We're trying
to make it out to you,

1341
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:17,808
But it's not looking
really good at this point,

1342
01:01:18,008 --> 01:01:19,376
So...

1343
01:01:21,011 --> 01:01:23,080
I need you to stay safe.

1344
01:01:25,015 --> 01:01:26,683
Stay in that hotel.

1345
01:01:28,118 --> 01:01:30,020
Your father's
coming to get you.

1346
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:32,289
He's gonna get you
out of there.

1347
01:01:37,394 --> 01:01:38,796
All right, tell them!

1348
01:01:39,897 --> 01:01:41,398
Tell them I helped you!

1349
01:01:41,598 --> 01:01:43,233
I didn't have
to help you!

1350
01:01:43,433 --> 01:01:47,171
You told me
that we would make it
on that bus!

1351
01:01:47,371 --> 01:01:48,205
Sir, I understand,
but...

1352
01:01:48,405 --> 01:01:49,740
Look, it's leaving!

1353
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:51,241
Look, I have a life!

1354
01:01:51,441 --> 01:01:53,744
Why should I
be punished for
helping them?

1355
01:01:53,944 --> 01:01:54,745
That doesn't make
any sense!

1356
01:01:54,945 --> 01:01:55,545
Sir...

1357
01:01:55,746 --> 01:01:56,881
I'm getting on that bus!

1358
01:01:57,081 --> 01:01:57,882
Sir!

1359
01:01:58,648 --> 01:01:59,016
Get your hands
off me!

1360
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:01,385
Hey!

1361
01:02:01,585 --> 01:02:04,822
[Grunting]

1362
01:02:05,923 --> 01:02:07,391
Get your hands off me!

1363
01:02:07,591 --> 01:02:08,859
Get off me!

1364
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:11,128
I deserve to be
on that bus!

1365
01:02:11,328 --> 01:02:13,197
Calm down, sir!
Calm down, sir!

1366
01:02:13,397 --> 01:02:14,264
Calm down!
Get off me!

Calm down, sir!
Calm down!

1369
01:02:28,045 --> 01:02:29,479
All right, back off.

1370
01:02:29,679 --> 01:02:32,850
You don't get to choose
who lives and who dies.

1371
01:02:33,050 --> 01:02:35,519
I was supposed to be
on that bus.

1372
01:02:35,719 --> 01:02:37,287
I helped them!

1373
01:02:41,158 --> 01:02:42,860
Well, if you
get to choose...

1374
01:02:43,928 --> 01:02:45,029
Well,
then so can I.

1375
01:02:46,130 --> 01:02:48,398
Mr. Kaplin,
please don't.

1376
01:02:49,466 --> 01:02:50,534
You used me.

1377
01:02:58,075 --> 01:02:59,176
Hank...

1378
01:03:00,377 --> 01:03:02,312
I'm just sending this
to you,

1379
01:03:02,512 --> 01:03:04,781
Because I don't want Ali
to hear or see this.

1380
01:03:04,982 --> 01:03:05,983
I don't want her to lose hope,

1381
01:03:06,183 --> 01:03:08,118
But I don't want you
to lose hope either,

1382
01:03:08,318 --> 01:03:10,454
But things are getting
really tight down here.

1383
01:03:10,654 --> 01:03:13,991
And you know I'm not the kind
that gets sentimental...

1384
01:03:16,326 --> 01:03:21,866
But I just want you
to know that I love you...

1385
01:03:24,268 --> 01:03:29,373
You big, strong,
wonderful flyboy, you.

1386
01:03:31,241 --> 01:03:34,378
You are the Orville
to my Wilbur.

1387
01:03:34,578 --> 01:03:36,380
Don't you dare say,
"Redenbacher,"

1388
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:39,483
Because that's a stupid joke,
and I'm always saying

1389
01:03:39,683 --> 01:03:42,252
That you're too old
to be saying it, anyway.

1390
01:03:44,721 --> 01:03:47,324
But you are my husband,

1391
01:03:47,524 --> 01:03:50,895
My partner, my granite rock,

1392
01:03:51,095 --> 01:03:56,533
And I thank God
for you every day.

1393
01:03:58,702 --> 01:04:02,139
Thank you so much
for saving me.

1394
01:04:02,339 --> 01:04:04,541
You have no idea.

1395
01:04:04,741 --> 01:04:06,276
And no matter what happens,

1396
01:04:06,476 --> 01:04:09,013
There's nothing
that's going to take that away,

1397
01:04:09,213 --> 01:04:12,149
How I feel for you
and what you mean to me.

1398
01:04:14,651 --> 01:04:18,889
And if we don't get out of this
alive or together...

1399
01:04:20,324 --> 01:04:22,592
Just know that I love you.

1400
01:04:26,496 --> 01:04:28,532
I love you, Hank.

1401
01:04:30,534 --> 01:04:32,036
Go get Ali.

1402
01:04:35,239 --> 01:04:36,974
Go get our baby girl.

1403
01:04:41,278 --> 01:04:43,213
[Both coughing]

1404
01:04:45,382 --> 01:04:47,051
Ali's strong.

1405
01:04:48,218 --> 01:04:50,387
She'll make it
without us.

1406
01:04:51,788 --> 01:04:53,924
Wait.

1407
01:04:54,124 --> 01:04:55,359
Another foreshock's
coming.

1408
01:04:56,593 --> 01:04:58,128
You sure?

1409
01:04:59,196 --> 01:05:01,231
100%.

1410
01:05:01,431 --> 01:05:03,300
[Both coughing]

1411
01:05:04,301 --> 01:05:05,302
It'll crush us.

1412
01:05:05,502 --> 01:05:06,971
Probably.

1413
01:05:07,171 --> 01:05:09,940
[Debris shifting, falling]

1414
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:12,576
[Both coughing]

1415
01:05:24,421 --> 01:05:26,123
Chevy Chevette.

1416
01:05:28,158 --> 01:05:29,159
What?

1417
01:05:30,227 --> 01:05:31,295
Electric blue

1418
01:05:31,495 --> 01:05:35,932
1977 Chevy Chevette

1419
01:05:36,133 --> 01:05:39,503
That I loved with
my whole heart.

1420
01:05:42,239 --> 01:05:44,274
That was my first car.

1421
01:05:47,711 --> 01:05:49,513
Hey!
Huh?

1422
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:52,282
Wake up.

1423
01:05:55,585 --> 01:05:58,655
[Coughing]
What?

1424
01:05:58,855 --> 01:06:00,657
I want
to tell you, Nick...

1425
01:06:04,494 --> 01:06:06,296
You're really
a solid guy.

1426
01:06:07,497 --> 01:06:09,399
I think it's safe
to say that...

1427
01:06:10,834 --> 01:06:13,570
You would
have moved Heaven
and Earth for Ali.

1428
01:06:13,770 --> 01:06:15,472
Ironic choice of words.

1429
01:06:16,706 --> 01:06:18,275
[Coughs]

1430
01:06:18,475 --> 01:06:20,177
Yes, I love Ali.

1431
01:06:21,778 --> 01:06:24,048
She could have done
a lot worse.

1432
01:06:24,248 --> 01:06:25,649
So...

1433
01:06:27,217 --> 01:06:28,485
Can we talk
about my grade now?

1434
01:06:28,685 --> 01:06:29,753
Not changing it.

1435
01:06:29,953 --> 01:06:31,655
[Chuckles]

1436
01:06:31,855 --> 01:06:33,490
Didn't think so.

1437
01:06:39,729 --> 01:06:42,132
Ferdinand was
our first kid.

1438
01:06:43,633 --> 01:06:45,469
What?

1439
01:06:46,736 --> 01:06:51,508
Ferdinand, that...
That dumb little toy.

1440
01:06:53,343 --> 01:06:54,744
Ali hated it,

1441
01:06:54,944 --> 01:06:57,381
But, uh,
she threw it away

1442
01:06:57,581 --> 01:06:59,549
Or dropped it
or something.

1443
01:07:00,917 --> 01:07:02,319
But I kept it.

1444
01:07:04,388 --> 01:07:08,092
When she found that I had it,
she made fun of me...

1445
01:07:09,393 --> 01:07:11,095
But it grew on her,

1446
01:07:11,295 --> 01:07:13,530
And she got
sentimental about it.

1447
01:07:13,730 --> 01:07:15,365
A little toy.

1448
01:07:17,767 --> 01:07:20,404
[Coughing]
Stupid.

1449
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:23,307
It's not stupid.

1450
01:07:23,507 --> 01:07:25,709
I just wanted
to give it to her.

1451
01:07:26,910 --> 01:07:28,312
Yeah.

1452
01:07:37,321 --> 01:07:38,788

Nick! Air! Air!

1455
01:07:54,838 --> 01:07:58,342
I think I see the... I think
I can see a way out! Come on.

[Coughing]

1457
01:08:13,990 --> 01:08:15,559
I see light.

1458
01:08:17,461 --> 01:08:18,462
Fresh air.

1459
01:08:18,662 --> 01:08:20,164
[Coughing]

1460
01:08:20,364 --> 01:08:21,398
Can we make it out?

1461
01:08:21,598 --> 01:08:23,167
Ah, no way.

1462
01:08:29,806 --> 01:08:32,209
Wait. I see
the way out.

1463
01:08:33,277 --> 01:08:34,744

[Coughing]

1465
01:08:41,851 --> 01:08:43,220
Oh, no.
What?

1466
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:44,888
There's more gas
this way.

1467
01:08:45,088 --> 01:08:47,391
[Groans]
Take a deep breath!

1468
01:08:47,591 --> 01:08:49,526
No, we can make it!

[Both coughing]

1471
01:09:22,626 --> 01:09:24,294
If that sparks,
we're dead.

1472
01:09:40,744 --> 01:09:42,446
No! No!

1473
01:09:42,646 --> 01:09:44,214
Yeah, I can pick this.
Just let me

1474
01:09:44,414 --> 01:09:46,182
Look for a paper clip
or something.

1475
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:54,824
Whoa, wait,
wait, wait, wait!
You can cause a spark!

1476
01:09:56,626 --> 01:09:57,594
Come on!

1477
01:09:57,794 --> 01:09:58,662

1478
01:10:16,112 --> 01:10:17,247

You have a vehicle.
I know you do.

1481
01:10:38,167 --> 01:10:39,469
You give me the keys.

1482
01:10:39,669 --> 01:10:41,271
We don't.
We have specific orders

1483
01:10:41,471 --> 01:10:42,939
To rendezvous
at the bomb shelter.

1484
01:10:45,475 --> 01:10:46,943
I don't believe you.

1485
01:10:47,143 --> 01:10:48,378
Downtown L.A.

1486
01:10:48,578 --> 01:10:49,713
Is the last place

1487
01:10:49,913 --> 01:10:52,316
Anybody would
wanna be during a 10.0.

1488
01:10:52,516 --> 01:10:53,550
Now give me the keys!

1489
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:54,718
Mr. Kaplin, I think

1490
01:10:54,918 --> 01:10:55,885
We should go
to the shelter.

1491
01:10:58,121 --> 01:10:59,523
You have a car,
don't you?

1492
01:10:59,723 --> 01:11:00,557
[Gasps]

1493
01:11:00,757 --> 01:11:01,858
Give me the keys.

1494
01:11:02,058 --> 01:11:03,427
It's too late for that.

1495
01:11:03,627 --> 01:11:04,728
I think
going to the shelter...

1496
01:11:04,928 --> 01:11:08,264
No, everything
is going to come down.

1497

W-We have to try.

1498
01:11:11,668 --> 01:11:14,504

to get some help!

I can't believe it!

1503
01:11:35,892 --> 01:11:37,293
We're not out
of the woods yet.

1504
01:11:37,494 --> 01:11:38,928
We gotta get Ali
and get to the roof!

I will shoot.

1506
01:11:54,944 --> 01:11:57,013
You had no right to say
I couldn't be on that bus!

I'm gonna live.

1508
01:12:00,684 --> 01:12:01,551
No.

1509
01:12:02,652 --> 01:12:03,853
All right, get back.

1510
01:12:04,053 --> 01:12:05,389
You, get over there!

1511
01:12:05,589 --> 01:12:06,390

No. No!

No, get off me!

1518
01:12:18,101 --> 01:12:19,969
I deserve to be
on that bus!

1519
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:21,371
I helped them!

1520

to choose!

No!

1524
01:12:30,113 --> 01:12:31,381
I can't believe
you're here!

1525
01:12:31,581 --> 01:12:32,482
We have to get out!

1526
01:12:33,383 --> 01:12:33,783
No, we have to get
to the roof.

1527
01:12:34,884 --> 01:12:35,719
What? No! The place
is going to collapse!

1528
01:12:36,586 --> 01:12:36,986
People, listen!
We gotta go!

1529
01:12:37,954 --> 01:12:38,888
The bomb shelter's
two blocks away.

1530
01:12:40,023 --> 01:12:41,357
No way.
We are talking
about an M12 now.

1531
01:12:42,759 --> 01:12:43,760
Nothing within miles
of this place will
be left standing.

1532
01:12:44,594 --> 01:12:45,395
What?
Come with us, okay?

1533
01:12:46,329 --> 01:12:46,863
There's a helicopter
on the roof.

1534
01:12:47,531 --> 01:12:48,131
Or will be, I hope.

1535
01:12:48,732 --> 01:12:49,365
Are you serious?

1536
01:12:50,266 --> 01:12:52,001
Ma'am,
I have orders.

1537
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:53,603
You guys have
to come with me.

1538
01:12:53,803 --> 01:12:54,604
And I am telling you
that this

1539
01:12:54,804 --> 01:12:55,872
Is your only chance
to survive.

1540
01:12:57,006 --> 01:12:59,042
This is insane.

1541
01:13:00,176 --> 01:13:02,078
Sir!
What?

1542
01:13:02,278 --> 01:13:03,480
Get him up!

1543
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:04,614
Move out!

1544
01:13:05,849 --> 01:13:06,783
All right.

1545
01:13:06,983 --> 01:13:07,784
Come on.

1546
01:13:08,552 --> 01:13:09,486
Is there room for Jackson?

1547
01:13:09,686 --> 01:13:10,587
You fast?

1548
01:13:11,488 --> 01:13:11,888
I ran a 5K fun run
last month.

1549
01:13:12,856 --> 01:13:13,790
That's good enough. Come on.
Okay.

1550
01:13:15,058 --> 01:13:17,060
[Yells]

1551
01:13:17,260 --> 01:13:18,995
Need to move.
I'm okay.

1552
01:13:19,195 --> 01:13:20,864
Come on, Mrs.
Lowenstein. We don't
have much time.

1553
01:13:21,064 --> 01:13:21,931
We have to get
to the roof.

1554
01:13:29,005 --> 01:13:30,006
Is he...

1555
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:36,880
Oh, God. I am so sorry,
Mrs. Lowenstein,

1556
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:38,848
But we have to hurry.

1557
01:13:39,048 --> 01:13:41,117
When I see the two of you
look at each other...

1558
01:13:41,317 --> 01:13:43,753
Your boyfriend, huh?

1559
01:13:43,953 --> 01:13:46,122
Makes me think of us
40 years ago.

1560
01:13:47,957 --> 01:13:49,959
I'm only gonna
slow you down.

1561
01:13:51,060 --> 01:13:51,995
Go.

1562
01:13:57,967 --> 01:14:00,003
[Coughing]

1563
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:18,488
Damn it!

01:14:18,688 --> 01:14:19,523

another stairwell

1565

of the building.

Ali, grab my hand!

01:14:49,352 --> 01:14:50,554
No!

1572

Mom!

1573
01:14:51,955 --> 01:14:52,889
Mama!

1574
01:14:53,089 --> 01:14:54,724
Oh, my God.

1575
01:14:54,924 --> 01:14:55,725
Okay.

Okay, Ali, you have
to let go of Nick.
What?

1579
01:15:02,999 --> 01:15:04,267
You're gonna have
to let go of him.
No, no.

1580
01:15:05,535 --> 01:15:06,069
Let me pull him up,
and then we'll
get you, okay?

1581
01:15:07,003 --> 01:15:07,704
I can't. I can't!
Yeah, you can.

1582
01:15:09,005 --> 01:15:11,908
You just put
one hand at a time

It's below us, but it
can suffocate us!

1589
01:15:43,239 --> 01:15:44,708
Better odds than
we're gonna get here.

1590

* Behind the dark *

1610
01:21:52,408 --> 01:21:57,646

gather at our feet *

1613

in black water tears *

1616
01:22:16,232 --> 01:22:21,670
