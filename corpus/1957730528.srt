I don't know, some big-shot
from D.C. he's hot, though.

351

just drooling over him.

All right, Daniela, so have you
ever donated eggs before?

387
00:22:53,114 --> 00:22:56,040
No, but a friend of mine did and
she said it was a perfect way

388
00:22:56,191 --> 00:22:57,933

you know?

This guy I'm seeing is worried

391

that the hormones will interfere
with our sex life.

392
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:07,367
Is that true?

393
00:23:07,445 --> 00:23:09,128
It can happen for some donors,

394
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,629
but most of the time
the biggest complaint

395
00:23:10,706 --> 00:23:12,539
is just the mood swings.

396
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:15,709
Well, nothing he can't fix
with some fine jewelry, right?

Huh, that's a beautiful house.

693
00:46:02,668 --> 00:46:06,245
I mean, it's like a dream home,
really.

694
00:46:06,322 --> 00:46:08,823
-Not bill's.
-You talked him into it?

695
00:46:08,825 --> 00:46:11,659
Oh, that's what
the fight was about.

696
00:46:11,677 --> 00:46:13,936
Bill had a gambling problem.

697
00:46:14,088 --> 00:46:15,846
I loved this house,
but mostly I thought

698
00:46:15,999 --> 00:46:17,756
real estate was a good way
to lock up our money.

699
00:46:17,834 --> 00:46:21,260
-So that bill couldn't touch it.
-Okay. Right.

700
00:46:21,337 --> 00:46:24,763
[Pickell] The next step for us,
we need to search your home.

701
00:46:24,841 --> 00:46:26,616
Great.

You own a Kenneth Cole
luggage set, Ms. McGuire?

704
00:46:35,518 --> 00:46:38,035
Uh, I do. I did.

705
00:46:38,112 --> 00:46:40,612
Uh, I don't know, I think bill
took it with him when he left.

706
00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:42,114
I don't know
if it's Kenneth Cole,

707
00:46:42,191 --> 00:46:44,358
but it's maybe something
name brand.

708
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:47,211
Ms. McGuire, this, this laptop,
yours or bill's?

709
00:46:47,288 --> 00:46:49,030
It's both of ours, we shared it.

710
00:46:49,032 --> 00:46:51,224
-May we take it for a few days?
-Yeah, of course.

711
00:47:01,394 --> 00:47:04,879
[Sighs] I mean, I don't know
what else they want from me.

712
00:47:04,897 --> 00:47:06,805
I have answered their questions.

713
00:47:06,883 --> 00:47:09,066
I've bent over backwards
trying to help them.

714
00:47:09,143 --> 00:47:11,735
And now they're just buzzing
around the house like bees.

715
00:47:11,812 --> 00:47:14,572
Okay, don't take it personal,
they're just doing their job.

716
00:47:14,648 --> 00:47:16,648
[Michael] Selene's right,
they're checking their boxes.

717
00:47:16,726 --> 00:47:18,059
They have to look at the spouse.

718
00:47:18,077 --> 00:47:20,561
That is an awful feeling.

719
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:22,746
It'll pass.
Just tell them everything.

720
00:47:22,823 --> 00:47:25,232
-What's everything?
-[Michael] Anything relevant.

721
00:47:25,251 --> 00:47:28,752
-Full cooperation.
-Oh...

722
00:47:28,905 --> 00:47:32,181
Well, what if it's not relevant,
but they might think it is?

723
00:47:33,426 --> 00:47:35,268
Mn-mn. This doesn't sound good.

724
00:47:37,838 --> 00:47:40,172
Remember how bill had a felony
for perjury?

725
00:47:40,249 --> 00:47:42,358
Yeah, the whole
speeding-ticket thing?

726
00:47:42,435 --> 00:47:44,752
He wouldn't have passed
a background check,

727
00:47:44,754 --> 00:47:46,178
so he asked me
to get it for him.

728
00:47:46,255 --> 00:47:48,364
Just pestered me about it
for months,

729
00:47:48,441 --> 00:47:50,533
so finally I just gave in.

730
00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:52,201
Get what, sweetheart?

731
00:47:54,188 --> 00:47:56,855
A gun.

732
00:47:56,875 --> 00:47:59,542
Uh, he wouldn't leave it alone,
you know, especially once

733
00:47:59,619 --> 00:48:00,951
he knew we were moving,
he thought we needed

734
00:48:01,028 --> 00:48:02,712
protection out there.

735
00:48:02,788 --> 00:48:04,438
-What kind of gun?
-Well, I don't, I don't know.

736
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:06,215
I don't know a gun
from a can of paint, pop.

737
00:48:06,292 --> 00:48:08,718
Whatever he told me to get.
A-A pistol.

738
00:48:08,794 --> 00:48:11,220
-Okay, where is it now?
-The hell if I know.

739
00:48:11,372 --> 00:48:13,389
I gave it to him,
I never saw it again.

740
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:15,466
Okay, okay, that's fine.
That's fine.

741
00:48:15,542 --> 00:48:18,135
We tell them now.
Get out in front of it.

742
00:48:18,212 --> 00:48:22,064
But the bigger problem
is gonna be when I bought it.

[Stanyan] This is April 26th,
at a retailer in Pennsylvania.

746
00:48:35,062 --> 00:48:39,398
A nickel-finish Taurus .38,
one box of wadcutter rounds.

747
00:48:39,475 --> 00:48:41,825
April 26th?
Where is this on our timeline?

748
00:48:41,902 --> 00:48:44,253
Two days before she claims
she last saw the victim.

749
00:48:44,756 --> 00:48:46,088
Ah...

Download me. Where are we?

751
00:48:55,916 --> 00:48:58,492
There's zero evidence
she had plans to leave him.

occurred immediately

00:49:05,017 --> 00:49:07,944
Mm, an attempt to back-fill
her narrative.

756
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:09,946
-Exactly.
-You've got the gun purchase.

Y-You don't have the gun,
though.

that bill took it with him.

You've one bullet retrieved from
the torso's ribcage,

760
00:49:15,511 --> 00:49:17,511
a wadcutter,
just like the one she purchased.

761
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:18,788
Unfortunately, it's the most

762
00:49:18,939 --> 00:49:20,439
popular target round
in the country.

763
00:49:20,516 --> 00:49:22,458
And the black garbage bags
found in the suitcases,

764
00:49:22,535 --> 00:49:25,186
they exactly match the bags
from the McGuire kitchen.

765
00:49:25,188 --> 00:49:27,463
Same grade of plastic,
the same factory.

766
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:30,282
But also the same commonality
problem as the bullets.

767

They're sold
all over the east coast.

single night, and I hold them

-I couldn't really ask him.

Now, could I? And since when are
you so concerned about the boys?

You haven't forgotten
about that, have you?

809
00:51:42,007 --> 00:51:46,009
Because you seem
remarkably uninterested.

00:54:50,179 --> 00:54:51,678
I thought
we're discussing motive.

861
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:54,865
We are.
A motive that gets a win for us.

[Patti] Now, a victim who had it
coming isn't gonna do that.

is a secret lover.

Obsession.

starting a new life with someone

of her old one...

868

I mean,
people can relate to that.

869
00:55:16,296 --> 00:55:18,296
And who of us hasn't dreamt

870
00:55:18,374 --> 00:55:20,983
of doing that
at least at one point?

871
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:24,061
-Of killing our spouses?
-No, of being free.

872
00:55:24,137 --> 00:55:27,489
Free, totally free,

873

-The night of.

881

Right.

882

The morning
the defendant claims,

883
00:55:54,743 --> 00:55:57,502

and police interviews,

884
00:55:57,521 --> 00:56:00,247

and feared for her life.

Well, ladies and gentleman
of the jury,

886

there was no fight.

-Yes, Anne?
-So far the townhouse is clean.

They did a luminol search
and they didn't find anything.

915

No blood in the bathroom,
no blood on the, on the couch.

proves to be somewhere else?

920
00:57:57,290 --> 00:57:59,716
It won't.
And we don't want it to.

1027
01:03:37,873 --> 01:03:40,390
you will have avenues
to contest my ruling.

1028
01:03:40,466 --> 01:03:44,635
-Yes, but, your honor, i-i...
-I'm speaking, Ms. McGuire.

1029
01:03:44,713 --> 01:03:47,471
Now, given
the extraordinary gravity

1030
01:03:47,549 --> 01:03:49,640
of the criminal action
against you

1031
01:03:49,718 --> 01:03:52,661
and given the allegations
of child neglect

1032
01:03:52,737 --> 01:03:54,812
by family members
through their counsel,

1033
01:03:54,832 --> 01:03:59,225
the court has no other choice
but to revoke custody.

1034
01:03:59,227 --> 01:04:01,652
So at this time
the court hereby assigns

1035
01:04:01,672 --> 01:04:05,841
emergency sole guardianship
to Jack and Jason's aunt,

1036
01:04:05,917 --> 01:04:07,342

[Melanie] Bill's sisters
are lying

1041

to family services about me.

1042
01:04:24,252 --> 01:04:26,194
I can petition
for supervised visits,

1043
01:04:26,346 --> 01:04:27,988
but a social worker
has to be there.

1044

Brad.

1045
01:04:33,095 --> 01:04:34,202
I'm here.

It's all over the news.
Charla's not talking to me.

1048
01:04:46,124 --> 01:04:47,674
No surprise there.

1049
01:04:49,035 --> 01:04:51,778
The RMA fired me today.

1050
01:04:51,796 --> 01:04:54,639
Oh, Brad, uh, I'm so sorry.

1051
01:04:55,726 --> 01:04:57,967
The detectives called me.

1052
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:00,954
-They wanna meet with me again.
-About what?

1053
01:05:00,956 --> 01:05:02,564
<i>They think I'm your accomplice.</i>

1054

For something
that didn't happen?

1055
01:05:04,476 --> 01:05:06,793
I know, uh...

1056
01:05:06,795 --> 01:05:08,695
Yeah, they're just trying
to scare me.

1057
01:05:10,741 --> 01:05:13,483
They said on the day
you bought the gun,

1058
01:05:13,635 --> 01:05:16,636
we were on the phone
for a hundred minutes.

1059
01:05:16,655 --> 01:05:18,488
You know what that looks like?

1060
01:05:18,564 --> 01:05:20,081
Well, we did nothing wrong.

1061
01:05:22,586 --> 01:05:24,419
So you'd tell me, right?

1062
01:05:26,256 --> 01:05:27,647
I mean,
if you had anything to do with

1063
01:05:27,649 --> 01:05:29,341
what happened to bill,
you'd tell me?

1064
01:05:30,669 --> 01:05:32,928
I already have.

1065
01:05:33,004 --> 01:05:34,578
Just say it again.

On my children's lives,
a thousand times over,

1067
01:05:37,008 --> 01:05:39,583

[Brad] Sweetie, I just wanted
to hear it again.

check in with you later.

[Stanyan] Ah. I know what
you're thinking. Why me?

1076
01:06:13,712 --> 01:06:17,213
The easy answer is you're
the lover of a murder suspect,

1077
01:06:17,365 --> 01:06:18,956
who we believe had help.

1078
01:06:19,034 --> 01:06:21,959
But another way
to think of it is

1079
01:06:22,037 --> 01:06:23,979
you're in a position
to help her.

1080
01:06:24,055 --> 01:06:27,482
Could be we're way off.
What you get from her proves it.

1081

You're way off.

1082
01:06:31,637 --> 01:06:33,655
I hope so, Dr. Miller.

1083

Can we get you anything?
Water? Coffee?

1097

No, thank you.

1098
01:07:46,379 --> 01:07:48,379
I must say, you've got
quite the advocate

in Selene Trevizas.

1100
01:07:50,233 --> 01:07:51,808
She was relentless.

Yeah, that's Selene,
uh, even when I told her

1102
01:07:54,629 --> 01:07:56,479
I couldn't possibly afford you.

1103

now. We'll figure it out.

-Good to meet you.
-Hi.

1107
01:08:06,991 --> 01:08:10,493
What they're doing to you,
Melanie, is appalling.

Prosecutors are bullies,

1109

is her own sadistic breed.

01:12:44,252 --> 01:12:45,843
I was feelin' better.

1197
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:49,772
And I needed my car,
so I went back for it.

1198
01:12:49,849 --> 01:12:53,183
Just so we're clear, that's
another two hours in a cab,

1199
01:12:53,261 --> 01:12:54,610
for a total of four hours,

1200
01:12:54,687 --> 01:12:57,930
the combined fares
close to, what, $500?

1201
01:12:57,932 --> 01:13:00,933
-Yeah.
-For a prank?

1202
01:13:00,952 --> 01:13:02,710
For my hide-a-car revenge, yes.

1203
01:13:04,622 --> 01:13:07,882
I mean, I'd done it before.

1204
01:13:07,959 --> 01:13:11,444
I could tell you a better story,
but it wouldn't be true.

1205
01:13:11,462 --> 01:13:13,129
You also called e-zpass billing

1206
01:13:13,281 --> 01:13:15,281
to try to get the charges erased
on this trip.

1207
01:13:15,283 --> 01:13:18,208
Right. After they started
investigating me.

1208
01:13:18,286 --> 01:13:20,210
Pfft. I was worried
how it'd make me look.

1209
01:13:20,288 --> 01:13:22,397
Oh. No kidding.

1210
01:13:24,049 --> 01:13:27,217
Stephen, let's remember,

1211
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:30,296
they have the burden of proof,
not us.

1212
01:13:30,298 --> 01:13:33,482
Their story has to be perfect,
not hers.

1213
01:13:33,559 --> 01:13:35,576
Know what our client is?

1214
01:13:35,728 --> 01:13:37,637
Consistent.

1215
01:13:37,639 --> 01:13:40,322
A year's worth of police
transcripts and recordings,

1216
01:13:40,475 --> 01:13:42,750
and she never wavers.

1217
01:13:42,902 --> 01:13:46,754
-That tells a jury she's honest.
-[Scoffs]

1218
01:13:46,831 --> 01:13:50,258
Hell, uh, even her boyfriend
couldn't shake her.

[Melanie on recording]
<i>Well, we did nothing wrong.</i>

1221
01:14:00,662 --> 01:14:02,586
[Brad on recording]<i> So you'd</i>
<i>tell me, right? I mean...</i>

1222
01:14:02,605 --> 01:14:04,254

<i>with what happened to bill...</i>

1223

<i>-You'd tell me.</i>
-[Melanie]<i> I already have.</i>

1226
01:14:12,173 --> 01:14:14,115
<i>absolutely nothing.</i>

1227
01:14:17,954 --> 01:14:21,697
Are you okay, Melanie?
Can we get you a-a water?

1228

[Dramatic music]

1230
01:14:48,133 --> 01:14:51,210
A wiretap, ladies and gentlemen,

1231
01:14:51,212 --> 01:14:56,065
is a weapon of choice
for lazy prosecutors.

1232
01:14:56,141 --> 01:15:00,386
[Tacopina] In my client's case,
detectives used Dr. Miller

1233
01:15:00,404 --> 01:15:02,997
to question her by proxy,

1234
01:15:03,148 --> 01:15:06,650
<i>forcing the man</i>
<i>she trusted most</i>

1235
01:15:06,728 --> 01:15:10,079
to catch her
at her most vulnerable,

1236
01:15:10,155 --> 01:15:13,582
without the benefit of counsel.

1237
01:15:13,735 --> 01:15:18,571
Remember, Ms. Prezioso
maintains, without evidence,

1238
01:15:18,589 --> 01:15:20,906
<i>that Dr. Miller was Melanie's</i>

1239
01:15:20,908 --> 01:15:23,684
<i>entire motive</i>
<i>for killing her husband.</i>

1240
01:15:23,761 --> 01:15:26,521
And yet I ask you,

1241
01:15:26,597 --> 01:15:29,431
where on those many tapes

1242
01:15:29,584 --> 01:15:32,843
<i>recorded during</i>
<i>raw and intimate moments</i>

1243
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:36,364
<i>does my client admit</i>
<i>or even imply,</i>

1244
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:38,924
she had anything to do

1245
01:15:38,943 --> 01:15:41,369
with bill McGuire's death?

1246
01:15:42,947 --> 01:15:45,188
Nowhere.

1247
01:15:45,208 --> 01:15:47,266
Even as Dr. Miller

1248
01:15:47,268 --> 01:15:51,361
pressed her over and over
for the confession

1249
01:15:51,439 --> 01:15:55,274
Ms. Prezioso
so desperately wanted...

1250
01:15:55,276 --> 01:15:59,036
While Dr. Miller was making
those recordings,

1251
01:15:59,113 --> 01:16:02,298
he was still seeing my client.

1252
01:16:02,450 --> 01:16:06,285
<i>He was still trusting her,</i>
<i>he was still loving her,</i>

1253
01:16:06,287 --> 01:16:09,897
<i>despite everything these</i>
<i>detectives were telling him.</i>

1254
01:16:11,717 --> 01:16:15,978
Those recordings
only exonerate my client.

1255
01:16:16,055 --> 01:16:20,649
They show the true,
the unguarded Melanie McGuire.

1256
01:16:20,726 --> 01:16:23,411
Imperfect? Yes.

1257
01:16:23,487 --> 01:16:28,324
Seeking refuge from a cruel
and violent husband...

1258
01:16:28,476 --> 01:16:31,160
-[Indistinct yelling]
-Don't touch me! Don't...

1259
01:16:31,236 --> 01:16:33,421
But a depraved killer?

1260
01:16:33,497 --> 01:16:34,714
No way.

1261
01:16:35,666 --> 01:16:36,674
Never.

1262
01:16:37,910 --> 01:16:39,910
So let's be done with all this.

1263
01:16:39,929 --> 01:16:44,323
We can grieve the victim,
and we absolutely should.

1264
01:16:44,325 --> 01:16:47,250
But, members of the jury,
I ask you,

1265
01:16:47,328 --> 01:16:51,022
end this persecution
of an innocent woman.

1266
01:16:52,683 --> 01:16:56,018
Melanie McGuire is not guilty

1267
01:16:56,170 --> 01:16:58,261
of this crime.

1268
01:16:58,339 --> 01:17:01,598
Allow her to get on
with her life.

1269
01:17:01,676 --> 01:17:06,287
Allow her to go home
to her children.

1270
01:17:08,791 --> 01:17:10,124
Thank you.

1271
01:17:29,312 --> 01:17:31,128
I gotta be honest,

1272
01:17:31,205 --> 01:17:35,724
keeping up with the defendant's
fantastical account

1273
01:17:35,877 --> 01:17:39,728
over the past two years
has been a full-time job.

1274
01:17:39,805 --> 01:17:41,471
But, thankfully,

1275
01:17:41,549 --> 01:17:44,808
she can't lie her way
out of DNA.

1276
01:17:44,827 --> 01:17:49,054
Can't spin the human sawdust
she tracked into bill's car

1277
01:17:49,073 --> 01:17:52,057
after cutting him to pieces.

1278
01:17:52,076 --> 01:17:53,834
You need nothing more
to convict her,

1279
01:17:53,911 --> 01:17:57,487
but there's even more,

1280
01:17:57,565 --> 01:17:58,989
and you have it in abundance,

1281
01:17:59,066 --> 01:18:02,927

that there was no fight.

1282
01:18:07,074 --> 01:18:10,500
In the early hours
of April 28th, 2004,

1283
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:12,687
there was no fight.

1284
01:18:12,838 --> 01:18:15,189
No, bill never sped off
in his car.

1285
01:18:15,340 --> 01:18:18,609
No, instead,
he lay in a stupor...

1286
01:18:20,679 --> 01:18:22,771
<i>From the chloral hydrate</i>

1287
01:18:22,848 --> 01:18:25,282
<i>that the autopsy found</i>
<i>in his bloodstream.</i>

1288
01:18:26,852 --> 01:18:28,536

for the faint of heart.

No, her actions tell us
that she did not,

because Melanie's last act
that night

1307
01:19:34,328 --> 01:19:37,021
was to throw out

He told the truth.

1341
01:21:27,608 --> 01:21:29,699
A version that, quite frankly,
many people

1342
01:21:29,777 --> 01:21:32,535
are having trouble believing.

1343
01:21:32,613 --> 01:21:34,963
Well, let's hope the 12 people
who matter the most

1344
01:21:35,116 --> 01:21:37,057
are smarter than that.

Even with all of our problems,
I desperately wanted bill

Finally, let me ask you
about Dr. Miller.

in the effort to convict you.

-Do you hold it against him?
-No. No, they threatened him.

1362

And he knew
I couldn't incriminate myself.

1363
01:22:33,098 --> 01:22:35,598
If you could do it
all over again,

1364
01:22:35,676 --> 01:22:38,601
would you still have the affair?

1365
01:22:38,679 --> 01:22:40,287
I don't know.

1366
01:22:40,364 --> 01:22:41,956
Do you still love him?

1367
01:22:42,458 --> 01:22:43,749
I did.

1368
01:22:45,777 --> 01:22:48,111
What do you think
happened to bill?

1369
01:22:48,189 --> 01:22:50,297
Do you really think
he ran afoul of the mob?

1370
01:22:50,374 --> 01:22:52,782
I mean, it certainly fits.

1371
01:22:52,860 --> 01:22:54,134
Got money on the street in ac,

1372
01:22:54,211 --> 01:22:57,262
that's how you get bullets
here and here.

1373

[Alice] Now, regardless
of the verdict,

1374
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:06,480
when this program airs,
viewers are going to hear

1375
01:23:06,557 --> 01:23:10,317
claims from you that
are impossible to corroborate.

1376
01:23:10,469 --> 01:23:12,611
Why should our audience
trust you?

1377
01:23:15,399 --> 01:23:17,574
I have no control over that.

1378
01:23:18,977 --> 01:23:20,995
But I know that I'm innocent.

1379
01:23:26,393 --> 01:23:27,334
Thank you.

that you get this a lot,

1383
01:23:37,755 --> 01:23:40,305
but you have
an incredible smile.

1384
01:23:41,833 --> 01:23:43,517
Uh, bill used to say that to me.

1385
01:23:43,594 --> 01:23:47,521
"A thousand watts
of blinding light," he'd say.

And disagreement.

1392
01:24:42,303 --> 01:24:45,562

will not be tolerated.
