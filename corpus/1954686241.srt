1
00:00:33,595 --> 00:00:40,049
False King, God
has no mercy on you.

2
00:00:41,385 --> 00:00:48,357
He shall fester you with boils
spawned by your many sins.

3
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:59,285
A child born in Israel will be
a far greater king than you.

4
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:05,374
He is born to destroy you
and those of your seed.

5
00:01:07,045 --> 00:01:11,714
God's wrath has come upon you.

6
00:01:11,766 --> 00:01:13,549
Agh!

7
00:01:16,387 --> 00:01:20,857
Agh, agh, agh.

8
00:01:23,528 --> 00:01:24,894
Agh!

9
00:01:24,946 --> 00:01:26,229
Agh!

10
00:01:26,281 --> 00:01:27,596
Agh!

11
00:01:27,649 --> 00:01:28,731
Did you see him?

12
00:01:28,783 --> 00:01:30,032
Did you see Isaiah?

13
00:01:30,101 --> 00:01:31,267
Did you see him?

14
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:32,401
Did you see him?

15
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:33,335
- Aahh.
- Fa... father

16
00:01:33,388 --> 00:01:35,331
...father it's me,
Antipas.

17
00:01:38,493 --> 00:01:39,575
Antipas,

18
00:01:44,883 --> 00:01:47,500
Wake the priests of the
Sanhedrin.

19
00:01:47,585 --> 00:01:48,801
Very well father.

20
00:01:48,887 --> 00:01:50,720
Now.

21
00:01:50,788 --> 00:01:51,971
I will see them now.

22
00:01:55,226 --> 00:01:59,128
Does your
majesty value truth?

23
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:04,734
For there is harsh
truth in your dream.

24
00:02:04,802 --> 00:02:06,152
I will hear it.

25
00:02:06,237 --> 00:02:11,324
To step beyond these
walls is to know King Herod

26
00:02:11,409 --> 00:02:12,575
is despised.

27
00:02:13,611 --> 00:02:16,362
The zealots denounce
you as a puppet.

28
00:02:16,447 --> 00:02:18,664
Enthroned by the Roman Emperor

29
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,616
against the will of the Jewish
people.

30
00:02:20,668 --> 00:02:23,119
Zealots cannot
enter my father's dreams.

31
00:02:23,171 --> 00:02:27,290
Unless
endowed by sorcery.

32
00:02:27,342 --> 00:02:28,490
Sorcery.

33
00:02:28,543 --> 00:02:30,293
You did
not see Isaiah.

34
00:02:33,965 --> 00:02:37,967
You saw a spectre, a figment.

35
00:02:38,019 --> 00:02:39,468
Figment.

36
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:44,340
The creation
of a sorcerer's skill.

37
00:02:44,392 --> 00:02:48,861
But through prayer
it can be vanquished.

38
00:02:48,947 --> 00:02:51,814
You are a warrior king.

39
00:02:51,866 --> 00:02:54,867
Your voice can make
a vapor of phantoms.

40
00:02:54,953 --> 00:02:56,362
Yes.

41
00:02:58,623 --> 00:02:59,655
A vapor.

42
00:02:59,707 --> 00:03:02,124
Come to the temple.

43
00:03:02,193 --> 00:03:07,363
Through prayer your strength
will grow ever greater.

44
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,730
Well done.

45
00:03:41,783 --> 00:03:44,917
To vanquish phantoms he prays.

46
00:03:45,003 --> 00:03:46,619
Whatever his faults,

47
00:03:46,704 --> 00:03:49,505
a bond between the throne and
temple serves order.

48
00:03:49,573 --> 00:03:52,792
And order serves the
preservation of our people.

49
00:03:57,849 --> 00:03:58,931
Follow me...

50
00:04:07,558 --> 00:04:08,607
Get down...

51
00:04:12,897 --> 00:04:13,963
Greetings.

52
00:04:15,233 --> 00:04:16,816
Greetings my...
Greetings sir.

53
00:04:28,162 --> 00:04:31,464
Father, the nobles
who are served by these men

54
00:04:31,549 --> 00:04:33,582
offer you gifts from the
land of the Hind.

55
00:04:36,637 --> 00:04:38,387
What do they
say of their masters?

56
00:04:38,456 --> 00:04:41,257
That they are
from beyond Parthia.

57
00:04:41,309 --> 00:04:44,760
Wanting what of me?

58
00:04:44,812 --> 00:04:47,012
They ask that you hear from their
own lips of their purpose.

59
00:04:48,182 --> 00:04:49,598
Arrange
entertainments.

60
00:05:09,871 --> 00:05:11,537
Majesty,

61
00:05:11,622 --> 00:05:14,156
an alignment of the stars has
drawn us here.

62
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:16,675
These stars.

63
00:05:16,761 --> 00:05:18,210
They foretell a great event.

64
00:05:18,296 --> 00:05:19,595
A child.

65
00:05:19,663 --> 00:05:23,165
Born in your kingdom is
the God of Israel's chosen.

66
00:05:23,217 --> 00:05:24,383
The Messiah.

67
00:05:24,469 --> 00:05:25,801
Messiah?

68
00:05:25,853 --> 00:05:27,553
A King of
the Davidic line to restore

69
00:05:27,638 --> 00:05:30,806
the glory of Israel, as in
the prophecy of Isaiah.

70
00:05:30,858 --> 00:05:31,992
Isaiah.

71
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:36,123
G...!

72
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:41,016
Of all the infant boys in
my kingdom

73
00:05:41,068 --> 00:05:44,069
how will you find this one child

74
00:05:44,155 --> 00:05:46,022
destined to be the Messiah?

75
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:47,356
Knowledge
that the day and time

76
00:05:47,408 --> 00:05:50,910
of his birth match the
position of the stars.

77
00:05:50,995 --> 00:05:53,796
And the child will
give us a sign.

78
00:05:53,864 --> 00:05:55,131
What a blessing.

79
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,260
Yes.

80
00:05:59,504 --> 00:06:00,553
Find this child.

81
00:06:03,707 --> 00:06:07,476
Send me news that I may
come and ... venerate him.

82
00:06:09,564 --> 00:06:11,263
I welcome your holy mission.

83
00:06:12,683 --> 00:06:13,826
Majesty.

84
00:07:53,834 --> 00:07:55,984
Joseph?

85
00:07:56,037 --> 00:07:58,003
What is it?

86
00:07:58,089 --> 00:08:02,207
This
attention, adulation of our boy.

87
00:08:02,293 --> 00:08:03,659
We must leave.

88
00:08:03,711 --> 00:08:05,678
Leave? Why?

89
00:08:05,763 --> 00:08:07,663
Herod.

90
00:08:07,715 --> 00:08:10,099
No king allows a
rival to his throne.

91
00:08:10,167 --> 00:08:11,634
- But our home?
- Enough!

92
00:08:15,473 --> 00:08:16,777
I know what I feel.

93
00:08:18,359 --> 00:08:19,975
You're leaving?

94
00:08:20,027 --> 00:08:21,560
There's danger here.

95
00:08:21,646 --> 00:08:23,028
Where will you go?

96
00:08:23,114 --> 00:08:24,280
Wherever Herod is not.

97
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:29,285
Elizabeth,
pack our things.

98
00:08:30,204 --> 00:08:32,187
We will go as well. Go on.

99
00:08:32,239 --> 00:08:35,324
Our purpose was visiting your
cousin and now we have none.

100
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:10,776
On this day,

101
00:09:10,861 --> 00:09:13,162
give no thought to what you do.

102
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:17,232
By King Herod's order, the
male babies, all of them!

103
00:09:17,284 --> 00:09:19,868
You seven this way,
the rest with me.

104
00:09:20,087 --> 00:09:21,236
In there.

105
00:09:22,072 --> 00:09:23,088
You two there.

106
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:25,991
Is it a boy?

107
00:09:26,077 --> 00:09:27,092
It's a girl!

108
00:09:27,178 --> 00:09:28,377
Show me.

109
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,245
Please.

110
00:09:31,932 --> 00:09:32,981
No.

111
00:09:35,419 --> 00:09:36,518
Where are your children?

112
00:09:36,587 --> 00:09:38,137
No. No. No. Aahh.

113
00:09:38,222 --> 00:09:39,772
No. Aaagghh

114
00:09:42,443 --> 00:09:44,226
Agh!

115
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,157
Please, I beg you,
don't kill my son.

116
00:09:58,242 --> 00:09:59,341
AGH!

117
00:10:58,352 --> 00:10:59,518
Who is there?

118
00:11:03,507 --> 00:11:04,523
Antipas?

119
00:11:09,146 --> 00:11:10,946
My heart.

120
00:11:11,014 --> 00:11:15,534
Agh.

121
00:11:15,619 --> 00:11:16,818
... Help me.

122
00:11:16,871 --> 00:11:17,953
Agh.

123
00:11:18,021 --> 00:11:19,288
Agh.

124
00:11:19,356 --> 00:11:20,522
Agh.

125
00:11:20,574 --> 00:11:26,194
Antipas, Anti.., Ant,
Antipas, Antipas...

126
00:11:46,905 --> 00:11:54,933
<font color="#3399CC">Subtitles by </font><font color="ffffff">MemoryOnSmells</font>
<font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>

127
00:12:06,203 --> 00:12:10,539
You find comfort here
where your father once ruled.

128
00:12:10,591 --> 00:12:12,958
Comfort.

129
00:12:13,043 --> 00:12:14,459
Better said lament.

130
00:12:14,545 --> 00:12:15,711
I too.

131
00:12:15,763 --> 00:12:17,930
I married to be queen.

132
00:12:18,015 --> 00:12:23,585
Tell me Antipas Tetrarch
of fair Galilee,

133
00:12:23,637 --> 00:12:26,138
am I a fool for wanting more?

134
00:12:26,223 --> 00:12:29,691
If so ...
we are both fools.

135
00:12:31,612 --> 00:12:37,783
Promise I will someday
find you here not lamenting,

136
00:12:37,868 --> 00:12:43,655
but ruling Jews, all Jews,
as your father ruled.

137
00:12:43,741 --> 00:12:46,825
All powerful, not a
puppet of the Romans.

138
00:12:49,296 --> 00:12:54,049
I will not rest until
I'm on this throne as King.

139
00:12:54,635 --> 00:12:56,251
With you by my side.

140
00:13:08,182 --> 00:13:09,848
Greetings.

141
00:13:09,934 --> 00:13:12,067
The wheel of my cart has
broken on my way home.

142
00:13:12,135 --> 00:13:15,320
I'm a trader from Jerusalem,
please, can you help me?

143
00:13:15,406 --> 00:13:16,989
Jerusalem.

144
00:13:17,074 --> 00:13:19,891
- Shalom.
- Shalom.

145
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,611
Some years back I heard
of old Herod's death.

146
00:13:22,663 --> 00:13:25,414
Did his rule
pass to one of his sons?

147
00:13:25,482 --> 00:13:27,449
No, no
son of Herod rules now.

148
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,536
Rome sends Governors to rule.

149
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:36,425
And there's order.

150
00:13:36,493 --> 00:13:37,709
The Romans value that.

151
00:13:37,795 --> 00:13:39,511
What has become
of the sons of Herod?

152
00:13:39,597 --> 00:13:41,346
They
remain as Tetrarchs.

153
00:13:41,432 --> 00:13:43,966
Each has limited rule over
a piece of the kingdom.

154
00:13:44,018 --> 00:13:45,684
How is
life for the Jews?

155
00:13:45,769 --> 00:13:47,519
One
gets heavily taxed.

156
00:13:47,605 --> 00:13:49,304
But one gets by.

157
00:13:49,356 --> 00:13:52,357
Here in this
land of dog headed gods,

158
00:13:52,443 --> 00:13:56,028
I made great efforts teaching
my son our scripture,

159
00:13:56,113 --> 00:13:59,514
dreaming he might become a man
in the land given off by God.

160
00:13:59,566 --> 00:14:02,484
Perhaps it is time
to return, hmmm?

161
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:22,721
So this is the
Holy City of the Jews?

162
00:14:26,209 --> 00:14:30,145
Why don't they hail
their new governor?

163
00:14:30,213 --> 00:14:32,898
I don't come
seeking their love, Claudia,

164
00:14:32,983 --> 00:14:34,399
only respect.

165
00:14:38,989 --> 00:14:42,607
How do I dress when we
are taken to see the Jewish God?

166
00:14:42,693 --> 00:14:44,993
No one sees him.

167
00:14:45,062 --> 00:14:47,362
They believe he's everywhere.

168
00:14:47,414 --> 00:14:48,864
Everywhere?

169
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:51,750
But cannot be seen?

170
00:14:51,835 --> 00:14:54,002
How do they know he exists?

171
00:14:54,071 --> 00:14:56,371
Maybe he doesn't.

172
00:15:06,917 --> 00:15:08,383
Como on children...

173
00:15:09,053 --> 00:15:12,387
Ah, he's here, Jesus.

174
00:15:12,439 --> 00:15:15,090
Our cousin Elizabeth has not
seen you since you were

175
00:15:15,142 --> 00:15:17,425
a baby in arms.

176
00:15:17,478 --> 00:15:18,810
I've heard
so much about you.

177
00:15:18,896 --> 00:15:19,961
Aha...

178
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:27,402
I'd given up hope, but a trader
spoke of a Joseph of Nazareth

179
00:15:27,454 --> 00:15:29,237
who'd returned from afar.

180
00:15:29,289 --> 00:15:32,440
I felt at once it
was your Joseph.

181
00:15:32,493 --> 00:15:35,544
He brought us six
years before he died.

182
00:15:35,612 --> 00:15:37,379
Then blessed be God.

183
00:15:37,447 --> 00:15:39,915
He left you a life that's good.

184
00:15:39,967 --> 00:15:43,785
Is John a priest in
the temple, like Zechariah?

185
00:15:43,837 --> 00:15:45,220
My son, the Baptist,

186
00:15:45,288 --> 00:15:48,623
he's not beloved of the
Temple, or they of him.

187
00:15:48,675 --> 00:15:51,259
John found God in
the wilderness.

188
00:15:51,311 --> 00:15:52,811
Like Isaiah.

189
00:15:52,896 --> 00:15:54,179
Mmmm.

190
00:15:54,264 --> 00:15:56,314
Talk prophets with Jesus
and he'll recite them

191
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,849
'til our meat goes cold.

192
00:16:00,137 --> 00:16:01,737
You're
blessed with such a child.

193
00:16:01,789 --> 00:16:02,971
Jesus too.

194
00:16:03,023 --> 00:16:04,406
He's learned in scripture.

195
00:16:04,474 --> 00:16:05,490
Hmmmmm.

196
00:16:05,576 --> 00:16:09,111
Argues with the scribes and the
Pharisees in the synagogue.

197
00:16:09,163 --> 00:16:12,581
Then you
and John would find kinship.

198
00:16:12,649 --> 00:16:14,866
Hmmm, I must
first find him.

199
00:16:16,503 --> 00:16:17,753
You should.

200
00:16:22,826 --> 00:16:27,045
This attack on me, this was
beyond insults, beyond threat.

201
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,183
Hold it to their noses.

202
00:16:31,268 --> 00:16:35,604
Let them know what
I have suffered.

203
00:16:35,672 --> 00:16:39,691
Put your nose to the
stench that is your people,

204
00:16:39,777 --> 00:16:42,177
who hurled filth at me.

205
00:16:42,229 --> 00:16:47,566
But, for the brave legionnaires
who surrounded my litter,

206
00:16:47,651 --> 00:16:55,523
protecting me ... I should have
died under the hail of stones.

207
00:16:55,576 --> 00:16:59,194
And my wife is
attacked in your streets.

208
00:16:59,246 --> 00:17:00,962
- Governor...
- I should level

209
00:17:01,031 --> 00:17:03,364
this holy city

210
00:17:03,417 --> 00:17:05,634
- and cake the ruins with blood.
- Governor,

211
00:17:05,702 --> 00:17:08,170
though some oppose your rule...

212
00:17:08,222 --> 00:17:09,671
And who are they?

213
00:17:09,723 --> 00:17:11,706
You who claim authority?
Do you know that?

214
00:17:11,758 --> 00:17:13,975
If not what value
are you to Rome?

215
00:17:14,044 --> 00:17:15,894
Governor, my temple
guards have learned

216
00:17:15,979 --> 00:17:20,015
that the attack upon your noble
wife was led by a zealot:

217
00:17:20,067 --> 00:17:21,716
Samuel of Perea.

218
00:17:21,768 --> 00:17:26,688
And why is he
not here in chains, tortured,

219
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:29,524
begging that death
relieve his agony? Why?

220
00:17:29,576 --> 00:17:30,859
He and his followers

221
00:17:30,911 --> 00:17:32,410
have fled to the wilds of
Galilee.

222
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,999
Your place of rule.

223
00:17:38,068 --> 00:17:39,668
I'll offer rewards.

224
00:17:39,736 --> 00:17:40,902
He'll be betrayed.

225
00:17:40,954 --> 00:17:43,205
- Easily found.
- Found and killed.

226
00:17:43,257 --> 00:17:46,174
Along with all of his followers.

227
00:17:46,243 --> 00:17:49,511
- Killed by you.
- By me?

228
00:17:49,579 --> 00:17:52,247
Do
I sense hesitation?

229
00:17:52,299 --> 00:17:54,582
Do I tell the emperor our
enemies find sanctum

230
00:17:54,635 --> 00:17:57,919
- in your realm?
- No.

231
00:17:57,971 --> 00:17:59,521
I'll find him.

232
00:17:59,589 --> 00:18:01,022
Kill him.

233
00:18:01,091 --> 00:18:03,692
Hacked to shreds.

234
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,093
All of them.

235
00:18:05,145 --> 00:18:08,480
Governor we share
your fully justified fury,

236
00:18:08,565 --> 00:18:12,901
the enemies of order,
the enemies of us all.

237
00:18:12,953 --> 00:18:15,537
Then prove it.

238
00:18:15,605 --> 00:18:17,873
The body's of those who
disrespected my wife,

239
00:18:17,941 --> 00:18:24,746
and my office here, that
I may see them, and soon.

240
00:18:58,665 --> 00:19:01,416
Who were those people?

241
00:19:01,484 --> 00:19:03,868
They're zealots.

242
00:19:03,954 --> 00:19:06,121
Rather than submit they
cut their own throats.

243
00:19:23,761 --> 00:19:27,229
Hear oh
Israel, the Lord is our God.

244
00:19:27,403 --> 00:19:29,770
May the Lord bless
you and guide you.

245
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:34,008
May the Lord make his face shed
light upon you and be gracious

246
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,142
unto you?

247
00:19:35,211 --> 00:19:39,063
With these waters ...
cleanse your soul.

248
00:19:46,573 --> 00:19:50,557
May the Lord
bless you, and give you grace.

249
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:54,779
Let these waters clean
away, wash away her sins.

250
00:19:59,702 --> 00:20:01,836
May the Lord
shine light upon her.

251
00:20:01,904 --> 00:20:04,038
A new dawn is here.

252
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:06,407
Come do not be afraid.

253
00:20:06,459 --> 00:20:07,875
Your new birth awaits.

254
00:20:08,878 --> 00:20:11,128
Come to me.

255
00:20:11,214 --> 00:20:13,965
May our God shine
bright upon your eyes.

256
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:18,719
Let this water
cleanse your soul.

257
00:20:19,555 --> 00:20:23,190
Are you ready, my son?

258
00:20:29,065 --> 00:20:31,032
Welcome.

259
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,483
You are ready for a new dawn.

260
00:20:36,105 --> 00:20:37,167
Jesus.

261
00:20:39,542 --> 00:20:42,776
Listen everyone, here is the
Lamb of God

262
00:20:42,829 --> 00:20:45,546
who will shine a light on
all of you!

263
00:20:45,614 --> 00:20:49,834
Here is the one who will wash
away the sin from the world.

264
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,118
Jesus!

265
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:52,269
Jesus!

266
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:55,351
Cousin.

267
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,928
How could you know me?

268
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,597
How could I not?

269
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:07,318
My cousin Jesus, it is you.

270
00:21:07,403 --> 00:21:10,655
All this time I've known of the
prophecy and it's come true.

271
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,800
Come.

272
00:21:14,911 --> 00:21:19,664
People!

273
00:21:19,749 --> 00:21:22,333
The new light is here!

274
00:21:29,826 --> 00:21:32,826
How are you so certain that
what you believe of me is true?

275
00:21:32,879 --> 00:21:35,996
Cousin, in the
desert I found communion

276
00:21:36,049 --> 00:21:38,182
with our Lord.

277
00:21:38,267 --> 00:21:40,667
And the voices, they came...

278
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,002
The voices
told you I was coming?

279
00:21:42,055 --> 00:21:44,305
Yes. But I'm
only to open the way.

280
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,842
God speaking of me?

281
00:21:48,895 --> 00:21:50,978
Yes.

282
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,813
Cousin until this day,

283
00:21:52,865 --> 00:21:55,032
while I'm a man of strong
belief,

284
00:21:55,118 --> 00:21:56,701
I have worked a trade.

285
00:21:56,786 --> 00:21:57,851
A carpenter.

286
00:21:57,904 --> 00:21:59,033
Nothing more.

287
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:03,574
What is
prophesied cannot be denied.

288
00:22:04,327 --> 00:22:07,328
The cup will be raised
to your lips, Jesus.

289
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:11,332
Baptize me.

290
00:22:13,702 --> 00:22:17,054
And I too will go
into the desert,

291
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:20,973
- and listen for the voice of God.
- Yes. I will baptize you.

292
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:24,378
Though it is you who
should baptize me.

293
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,632
You're right.

294
00:22:26,549 --> 00:22:27,761
Come.

295
00:22:31,604 --> 00:22:35,439
Ahhh!!

296
00:22:37,994 --> 00:22:39,243
Ahhh!!!

297
00:22:39,328 --> 00:22:42,229
Let the
Lord shine his light upon you.

298
00:22:42,281 --> 00:22:46,867
To the new dawn, the new
light is with you, my cousin.

299
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:48,619
Come.
Come.

300
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:28,576
That boat,
it was my father's.

301
00:23:28,628 --> 00:23:30,110
Maybe his
father's before him.

302
00:23:30,163 --> 00:23:32,746
It was made with iron
nails, nails have value.

303
00:23:34,617 --> 00:23:37,835
Capped with trunnels
I can chisel them out.

304
00:23:41,057 --> 00:23:42,306
We share.

305
00:23:42,391 --> 00:23:44,258
Half and half.

306
00:23:52,468 --> 00:23:53,567
I must ready my nets.

307
00:23:53,636 --> 00:23:56,237
Fishing nails is easier
than netting fish.

308
00:23:56,305 --> 00:23:58,989
For months now the
whole is near empty.

309
00:23:59,075 --> 00:24:00,407
Do you ask
God's blessing?

310
00:24:02,495 --> 00:24:05,362
I know about
you Jesus of Nazareth.

311
00:24:05,448 --> 00:24:07,448
My brother Andrew
follows the Baptist.

312
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,483
He told how he greeted you.

313
00:24:09,535 --> 00:24:10,951
Yes, I remember him.

314
00:24:11,003 --> 00:24:13,504
So like the bug
eater, do you preach?

315
00:24:13,589 --> 00:24:16,373
Or just pray like
the rest of us?

316
00:24:16,459 --> 00:24:17,685
Take me with you.

317
00:24:20,829 --> 00:24:22,796
Who refuses
a hand on the net?

318
00:24:50,826 --> 00:24:51,943
Shall we pray?

319
00:25:29,115 --> 00:25:30,831
Thank the Lord.

320
00:25:35,621 --> 00:25:37,504
Ugh... Uhh...

321
00:25:52,939 --> 00:25:55,306
Jesus.

322
00:25:55,391 --> 00:25:58,425
This is from a single cast.

323
00:25:58,477 --> 00:26:01,779
I've fished years and
nothing, nothing like this.

324
00:26:03,149 --> 00:26:06,200
We prayed.

325
00:26:06,268 --> 00:26:10,738
Yes but ...
I'm a simple man.

326
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:12,456
A sinner.

327
00:26:12,541 --> 00:26:17,211
Never, never expecting this.

328
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:18,511
Follow me Simon.

329
00:26:22,835 --> 00:26:24,585
I'll make you a fisher of men.

330
00:26:32,678 --> 00:26:36,230
Ahhh... Ohhh...

331
00:26:36,632 --> 00:26:37,931
John.

332
00:26:37,984 --> 00:26:41,819
John and James are sons of
Zebedee, you must see this.

333
00:26:41,904 --> 00:26:44,438
Is this not a wonder?

334
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:49,443
A wonder brought to us by Jesus,
the carpenter from Nazareth.

335
00:26:50,579 --> 00:26:54,698
This is
nothing, only a sign.

336
00:26:54,784 --> 00:26:56,186
And there will be many.

337
00:26:58,821 --> 00:26:59,870
Follow me.

338
00:27:04,927 --> 00:27:10,214
Look into your hearts, and you
will know that God wills it.

339
00:27:19,173 --> 00:27:23,509
I denounce all those
that shame this land.

340
00:27:23,561 --> 00:27:24,977
Antipas.

341
00:27:25,046 --> 00:27:28,714
The Tetrarch, who in rampant
incest beds his brother's wife,

342
00:27:28,767 --> 00:27:30,600
while suppressing the righteous.

343
00:27:34,773 --> 00:27:37,157
And these

344
00:27:37,225 --> 00:27:40,560
...Spies from the Counsel of
Sanhedrin.

345
00:27:40,612 --> 00:27:42,362
The hypocrites.

346
00:27:42,431 --> 00:27:44,564
Hypocrites one and all.

347
00:27:44,616 --> 00:27:47,951
From the grandeur in which they
live they berate the poor,

348
00:27:48,037 --> 00:27:50,921
calling you unclean
for the food you eat.

349
00:27:51,006 --> 00:27:52,238
They shame you.

350
00:27:52,291 --> 00:27:53,907
But with a purpose.

351
00:27:53,959 --> 00:27:58,045
People! Come to the temple
they say, come.

352
00:27:58,097 --> 00:27:59,179
Buy a lamb.

353
00:27:59,247 --> 00:28:01,598
A white dove. A bullock for
sacrifice.

354
00:28:01,684 --> 00:28:05,135
Redeem your sins only with the
death of an animal

355
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:08,188
born from the farms of our high
priests.

356
00:28:08,256 --> 00:28:11,692
They have made of God's
house a market place.

357
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:17,230
I say to these spies, tell your
generation of vipers to beware,

358
00:28:17,282 --> 00:28:18,398
look heavenward.

359
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:21,451
Flee the wrath that
will come from the Lord.

360
00:28:22,738 --> 00:28:23,937
Flee from here,

361
00:28:23,989 --> 00:28:28,041
the Day of Judgment
is here, arise people!

362
00:28:29,745 --> 00:28:31,078
Rise up people.

363
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:32,796
Rise!

364
00:28:38,804 --> 00:28:41,138
Arrest the
Baptist, a lunatic?

365
00:28:41,223 --> 00:28:43,173
The wilderness crawls with them.

366
00:28:43,258 --> 00:28:46,593
Can you allow more
discord in your domain?

367
00:28:46,645 --> 00:28:47,794
Why me?

368
00:28:47,846 --> 00:28:49,146
He attacks you.

369
00:28:49,231 --> 00:28:50,647
The temple.

370
00:28:50,733 --> 00:28:52,766
Along
with you and your wife majesty.

371
00:28:52,818 --> 00:28:55,936
With vile accusations of incest.

372
00:28:55,988 --> 00:28:58,304
I must consider the
peasants who hail him

373
00:28:58,357 --> 00:28:59,931
as the coming of the prophet
Elijah.

374
00:29:05,914 --> 00:29:08,582
Your father
served Rome

375
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:11,835
by the strength of his rule,
and thus they made him king.

376
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,319
The Romans trusted him

377
00:29:13,372 --> 00:29:15,789
to prevent invasion from the
Parthians.

378
00:29:15,841 --> 00:29:18,491
And to keep
order among the Jews.

379
00:29:18,544 --> 00:29:20,627
For which he was hated.

380
00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:22,596
Some hated
David, and Solomon.

381
00:29:22,664 --> 00:29:24,347
Some hated Moses.

382
00:29:24,433 --> 00:29:26,466
What's your point?

383
00:29:26,518 --> 00:29:27,606
My point.

384
00:29:28,854 --> 00:29:32,139
Achieving a peaceful
end of Roman rule.

385
00:29:32,191 --> 00:29:35,559
The restoration
of a Jewish king,

386
00:29:35,644 --> 00:29:38,979
who gives Romans the
order they demand.

387
00:29:39,031 --> 00:29:41,198
And would Pilate
support that which costs him

388
00:29:41,283 --> 00:29:42,899
his place as governor?

389
00:29:42,985 --> 00:29:44,618
Of course
it works to his favor.

390
00:29:44,686 --> 00:29:48,455
Gaining for Rome a vassal Jewish
kingdom that keeps order

391
00:29:48,523 --> 00:29:49,689
that keeps Parthia at bay

392
00:29:49,741 --> 00:29:52,576
without the cost of military
occupation.

393
00:29:52,661 --> 00:29:56,079
Pontius Pilot would
return to Rome in triumph.

394
00:29:56,165 --> 00:29:59,499
A strong hand with dangerous
fanatics would be a step

395
00:29:59,551 --> 00:30:01,051
toward that goal.

396
00:30:01,136 --> 00:30:03,637
Leaving you King of the Jews.

397
00:30:10,813 --> 00:30:12,088
Shalom.

398
00:30:13,765 --> 00:30:19,186
You know it is written if your
enemy brings you harm...

399
00:30:19,238 --> 00:30:22,322
Tell me friend, if your enemy
brings you harm what is written?

400
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:24,390
An eye for an eye
and a tooth for a tooth.

401
00:30:24,443 --> 00:30:26,226
Yes. An eye for an eye.

402
00:30:26,278 --> 00:30:27,828
A tooth for a tooth.

403
00:30:27,896 --> 00:30:30,163
But now I say that
if God is love,

404
00:30:30,232 --> 00:30:33,333
then loving is serving God.

405
00:30:33,401 --> 00:30:35,535
And that means you
must love your enemy.

406
00:30:35,587 --> 00:30:37,504
You preach weakness.

407
00:30:37,572 --> 00:30:39,256
No, no, strength.

408
00:30:39,341 --> 00:30:41,007
The strength that if
one strikes your cheek,

409
00:30:41,076 --> 00:30:43,176
you turn and you let
him strike the other.

410
00:30:43,245 --> 00:30:45,462
If he takes your cloak,
you give him your tunic.

411
00:30:45,547 --> 00:30:47,247
Can you do this?

412
00:30:47,299 --> 00:30:48,798
What you ask of us.

413
00:30:48,884 --> 00:30:50,600
I will try.

414
00:30:50,686 --> 00:30:54,087
Try with each breath
on each and every day.

415
00:30:54,139 --> 00:30:56,056
Feeling that by our effort will
reveal to God

416
00:30:56,108 --> 00:30:58,525
what is in our hearts.

417
00:30:58,593 --> 00:31:02,095
Knowing that God is love, and in
a kingdom of God

418
00:31:02,147 --> 00:31:04,030
we will love our enemies.

419
00:31:04,099 --> 00:31:05,482
He's crazy.

420
00:31:05,567 --> 00:31:06,783
You can't love enemies.

421
00:31:06,869 --> 00:31:09,602
Love and forgive them,
that we can be forgiven.

422
00:31:09,655 --> 00:31:12,656
And judge not so that
you not be judged.

423
00:31:12,741 --> 00:31:15,075
The kingdom of
God is within you.

424
00:31:15,127 --> 00:31:16,543
- Another of this...
- Each of you.

425
00:31:18,664 --> 00:31:20,825
Those who look within
themselves will find it.

426
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:26,002
They walk away.

427
00:31:26,088 --> 00:31:29,005
He is blessed with
something, I've seen it.

428
00:31:29,091 --> 00:31:31,508
A Bountiful catch,
maybe nothing more.

429
00:31:31,593 --> 00:31:33,593
Rabi.

430
00:31:33,645 --> 00:31:36,012
Rabi please help me.

431
00:31:36,098 --> 00:31:38,098
I'm cursed.

432
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:39,316
Why do you say this?

433
00:31:39,401 --> 00:31:42,736
My son is
possessed by demons.

434
00:31:42,804 --> 00:31:43,937
Take me to him.

435
00:32:01,757 --> 00:32:06,159
The demons rest,
but they will awake.

436
00:32:06,211 --> 00:32:07,510
What's his name?

437
00:32:07,596 --> 00:32:08,845
David.

438
00:32:18,273 --> 00:32:19,472
David, can you hear me?

439
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:31,351
I'm speaking to you David, not
to what evil possesses you

440
00:32:31,403 --> 00:32:32,535
but to you.

441
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:38,041
I speak to you David.

442
00:32:38,126 --> 00:32:39,292
Hear me David.

443
00:32:39,361 --> 00:32:40,710
Hear me David.

444
00:32:40,796 --> 00:32:42,028
That's it.

445
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,080
Ssh.
Ssh.

446
00:32:44,166 --> 00:32:45,865
Be still.

447
00:32:45,917 --> 00:32:47,050
Be still.

448
00:32:47,135 --> 00:32:48,151
Is he gone to see the
child?

449
00:32:48,237 --> 00:32:49,202
What's he going to do?

450
00:32:49,254 --> 00:32:51,537
Get back! Get back!
Please!

451
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:52,973
What is he doing?
What is he doing?

452
00:32:53,041 --> 00:32:55,642
He's casting them out.
Demons!

453
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:58,011
Demons... Can he do that?

454
00:33:03,568 --> 00:33:05,602
Be still.

455
00:33:05,687 --> 00:33:06,820
David.

456
00:33:16,531 --> 00:33:17,914
David...

457
00:33:38,103 --> 00:33:39,436
Oh no.

458
00:33:40,972 --> 00:33:42,605
Please everyone just.
Step back.

459
00:33:47,946 --> 00:33:49,184
Hear me.

460
00:33:51,766 --> 00:33:53,007
The child is dead.

461
00:33:58,156 --> 00:34:01,574
No, Oh No,
Say it isn't so.

462
00:34:37,612 --> 00:34:38,945
Water.

463
00:34:46,671 --> 00:34:48,455
David.

464
00:34:48,507 --> 00:34:50,256
My son.

465
00:34:54,463 --> 00:34:56,262
I'm thirsty.

466
00:34:56,331 --> 00:34:58,131
Yes.

467
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:03,937
Thank you.

468
00:35:04,005 --> 00:35:05,138
Thank you.

469
00:36:16,305 --> 00:36:17,972
Ahhh...

470
00:36:38,819 --> 00:36:40,368
The Baptist.

471
00:36:40,454 --> 00:36:41,653
As promised.

472
00:36:41,705 --> 00:36:43,988
Mother, he's the
one who slanders our house?

473
00:36:44,041 --> 00:36:47,736
Salome this
is not for your eyes.

474
00:37:15,289 --> 00:37:16,905
Take him away.

475
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:19,908
Let him rot, and his
prophecy rot with him.

476
00:37:51,358 --> 00:37:53,525
Tell me, Rabbi.

477
00:37:53,577 --> 00:37:55,610
In Jerusalem will you denounce
the Romans

478
00:37:55,696 --> 00:37:57,061
and those in league with them?

479
00:37:57,114 --> 00:37:58,947
I'm not a zealot.

480
00:37:59,032 --> 00:38:02,033
I come only to bring
word of God's love.

481
00:38:02,085 --> 00:38:04,085
And to say that all
must be born again.

482
00:38:04,171 --> 00:38:05,666
Born a second time?

483
00:38:06,623 --> 00:38:09,424
One can't re-enter
the womb, Rabbi.

484
00:38:09,509 --> 00:38:11,793
Or is that one of the wonders
that supposedly

485
00:38:11,879 --> 00:38:13,461
you have wrought?

486
00:38:13,547 --> 00:38:16,381
Are you a
scribe or a Pharisee?

487
00:38:16,433 --> 00:38:19,083
Are your
words not for all?

488
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:21,102
Yes for all.

489
00:38:21,188 --> 00:38:24,306
I'm here to speak of a light
coming into the world.

490
00:38:24,391 --> 00:38:28,276
And those who live by the
truth can enter this light,

491
00:38:28,362 --> 00:38:29,728
knowing it.

492
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:33,231
It can be plainly seen that
whatever they do from them on,

493
00:38:33,283 --> 00:38:34,524
is done through God.

494
00:38:37,571 --> 00:38:38,737
Have you understood?

495
00:38:40,106 --> 00:38:41,239
I have.

496
00:38:42,075 --> 00:38:43,106
Rabbi!

497
00:38:47,331 --> 00:38:48,630
John?

498
00:38:48,715 --> 00:38:49,915
Is it John?

499
00:38:49,967 --> 00:38:52,300
The Tetrarch
arrested him.

500
00:38:52,386 --> 00:38:55,220
And they've taken him to the
fortress called Machaerus.

501
00:38:55,288 --> 00:38:57,422
It's in the desert
across the Jordan.

502
00:38:57,474 --> 00:38:58,590
There's no hope for rescue.

503
00:39:04,014 --> 00:39:07,265
How do I
now speak of love?

504
00:39:07,317 --> 00:39:09,100
Forgiveness, How?

505
00:39:13,106 --> 00:39:15,106
I am trapped by the feelings of
a man who longs to attack

506
00:39:15,158 --> 00:39:16,358
this injustice.

507
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:23,865
Now I know my father's
anger at how we fail him.

508
00:39:23,951 --> 00:39:28,503
Now I feel I am not to
bring peace, but a sword.

509
00:39:41,802 --> 00:39:43,935
What magnificent buildings.

510
00:39:44,004 --> 00:39:47,171
Who is not awed by this?

511
00:39:47,224 --> 00:39:48,506
Look upon them.

512
00:39:48,558 --> 00:39:52,694
Burn them into your memory, for
I say that not one stone

513
00:39:52,779 --> 00:39:55,697
will remain upon the other.

514
00:39:55,782 --> 00:39:57,449
All will be thrown down.

515
00:39:57,517 --> 00:40:00,184
All!
All of what you see.

516
00:40:00,237 --> 00:40:03,204
It is written in the book
of the prophet, Malachi,

517
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:07,575
before the great and dreadful
day of the Lord comes,

518
00:40:07,661 --> 00:40:09,661
I will send you
the Prophet Elijah.

519
00:40:09,713 --> 00:40:13,415
Now I say that Elijah did come.

520
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:17,836
Calling us to redemption
in waters of the Jordan.

521
00:40:17,888 --> 00:40:23,425
For the Lord offers forgiveness
of sin to all with a true heart.

522
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:25,844
He speaks
of John the Baptist.

523
00:40:25,896 --> 00:40:29,264
I was redeemed in the waters
of Jordan by John the Baptist.

524
00:40:29,349 --> 00:40:30,381
Yes.

525
00:40:30,434 --> 00:40:32,767
Jesus speaks of John the Baptist

526
00:40:32,853 --> 00:40:36,237
who has been imprisoned by his
enemies.

527
00:40:36,323 --> 00:40:39,074
Yes. Like Elijah, John
came.

528
00:40:39,159 --> 00:40:43,061
But they did not know him, and
did to him as they wished.

529
00:40:43,113 --> 00:40:47,231
Free him.
Vipers. Destroy it.

530
00:40:47,284 --> 00:40:49,334
Those of the Counsel of
the Sanhedrin

531
00:40:49,402 --> 00:40:51,069
are a generation of vipers.

532
00:40:51,121 --> 00:40:52,871
Viper!
Yes!

533
00:40:52,923 --> 00:40:54,756
Vipers.
Vipers.

534
00:40:58,178 --> 00:40:59,744
I say
destroy this temple.

535
00:40:59,796 --> 00:41:01,713
Destroy it.

536
00:41:06,937 --> 00:41:09,721
And in three days
I will raise it up again.

537
00:41:09,773 --> 00:41:12,557
Destroy this market place
that shames our Lord.

538
00:41:12,609 --> 00:41:16,444
HOSANNA.

539
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:21,199
Hosanna!

540
00:41:42,472 --> 00:41:45,456
I share
your anger, Rabbi.

541
00:41:45,509 --> 00:41:46,554
Let me follow you.

542
00:41:48,061 --> 00:41:49,594
What is your name?

543
00:41:49,646 --> 00:41:51,096
Judas Iscariot.

544
00:41:54,484 --> 00:41:56,017
Bless you Judas.

545
00:42:02,526 --> 00:42:07,278
Jesus challenges us
but I did not hear blasphemy.

546
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:09,247
And when he called for
the destruction of this temple

547
00:42:09,315 --> 00:42:11,866
calling it a market place,
what is that if not blasphemy.

548
00:42:11,952 --> 00:42:15,153
Many devout Jews
criticize the commerce,

549
00:42:15,205 --> 00:42:16,454
the money lending.

550
00:42:16,506 --> 00:42:20,258
Standing there,
he derides this ... beauty,

551
00:42:20,326 --> 00:42:24,679
this grandeur with threats,
derides a place where for me,

552
00:42:24,764 --> 00:42:28,183
each stone is sacrosanct.

553
00:42:28,268 --> 00:42:31,853
A place where every day 700 of
our priests perform rituals

554
00:42:31,938 --> 00:42:35,974
for the truly devout, for whom
this is the house of God.

555
00:42:36,026 --> 00:42:40,511
To be protected with
our lives, our blood.

556
00:42:40,564 --> 00:42:45,283
I heard the Nazarene's words,
and I heard blasphemy.

557
00:42:57,998 --> 00:42:59,497
Joshua? Can we see him
Joshua?

558
00:42:59,582 --> 00:43:01,115
Can we see the Baptist?

559
00:43:01,167 --> 00:43:02,250
Ssh.

560
00:43:02,318 --> 00:43:03,515
Get back.

561
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:15,182
Can we see him?

562
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:17,217
Impossible.

563
00:43:17,269 --> 00:43:21,021
He'll be taken and killed.

564
00:43:21,089 --> 00:43:23,891
Pass on your words and
bring his response.

565
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:33,367
Joshua.

566
00:43:33,435 --> 00:43:36,069
They've come.

567
00:43:36,122 --> 00:43:40,491
Thomas and Andrew
with news of Jesus.

568
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:41,850
Then
God has blessed me.

569
00:43:44,446 --> 00:43:47,464
They say Jesus now
travels the land preaching

570
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:49,449
as you have preached.

571
00:43:49,502 --> 00:43:54,922
God offers his
son, and Jesus takes up the cup.

572
00:43:54,974 --> 00:43:57,424
And you will
be reunited with him?

573
00:43:57,476 --> 00:43:59,059
No.

574
00:43:59,127 --> 00:44:01,562
His will be a lone path.

575
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:04,297
I will be martyred
here, in this place.

576
00:44:07,937 --> 00:44:09,803
No sadness.

577
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:12,439
Praise God for the son
he offers in Jesus.

578
00:44:12,491 --> 00:44:14,191
Pray.

579
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:16,326
Pray Joshua.

580
00:44:18,831 --> 00:44:19,913
Praise God.

581
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:23,834
My son.

582
00:44:23,919 --> 00:44:25,008
Mother.

583
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:32,376
It is said that you've
lured fisherman from Galilee

584
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:35,095
from honest work to
follow as you preach.

585
00:44:35,163 --> 00:44:38,799
Preach what they
say is contrary.

586
00:44:38,851 --> 00:44:42,636
Not contrary
to the word of God.

587
00:44:42,688 --> 00:44:44,337
Who knows?

588
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:49,342
My life is about this,
putting bread on the table.

589
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:52,813
Oh, we don't
live by bread alone.

590
00:44:52,865 --> 00:44:57,517
What James means ... it is
said you healed the sick

591
00:44:57,570 --> 00:45:01,121
as if by...

592
00:45:01,189 --> 00:45:03,824
She won't say the word.
But I'll say it. Sorcery.

593
00:45:07,546 --> 00:45:10,581
I comfort the sick.

594
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:14,468
When they're cured it
is by the hand of God.

595
00:45:14,536 --> 00:45:17,921
Bear in mind what you go
about saying and doing

596
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:22,059
impacts us as well.

597
00:45:22,144 --> 00:45:23,160
Mother.

598
00:45:23,245 --> 00:45:24,344
James.

599
00:45:24,396 --> 00:45:27,180
All who I call family,
how I love you

600
00:45:27,233 --> 00:45:28,849
and will always love you.

601
00:45:31,186 --> 00:45:33,320
You cannot understand
the path I've taken.

602
00:45:34,907 --> 00:45:37,491
But the call of God
comes before all of us.

603
00:45:37,559 --> 00:45:40,894
And for you, I'm just Jesus.

604
00:45:40,946 --> 00:45:43,330
Not the most skilled
at carpentry.

605
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:48,502
And sadly no prophet is
accepted among his own.

606
00:45:52,341 --> 00:45:53,840
I can only hope that maybe
someday

607
00:45:59,748 --> 00:46:00,929
...who knows.

608
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:10,256
The betrothed, are
they not glorious to behold?

609
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:14,394
Salome was raised with
the laws of the covenant.

610
00:46:14,446 --> 00:46:18,198
What joy to know my son's
chosen is from a house beholden

611
00:46:18,266 --> 00:46:20,600
to our laws.

612
00:46:20,653 --> 00:46:24,905
We of my house, live
by the word of God.

613
00:46:24,957 --> 00:46:26,044
As do we.

614
00:46:28,610 --> 00:46:32,129
Among us are
followers of a prophet.

615
00:46:32,214 --> 00:46:33,380
A prophet?

616
00:46:33,448 --> 00:46:36,616
Who spoke like Elijah and
washed away sin

617
00:46:36,669 --> 00:46:38,251
in the waters of the Jordan.

618
00:46:38,304 --> 00:46:39,836
And offended
the order of things.

619
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:41,638
As many are offended
by his imprisonment.

620
00:46:44,059 --> 00:46:50,430
As Salome's bride price,
I ask for his freedom.

621
00:46:50,482 --> 00:46:54,601
We offer
herds, our finest wines,

622
00:46:54,653 --> 00:46:57,020
oils to enrich your house.

623
00:46:57,106 --> 00:47:00,407
Riches do not
equal a prophet's life.

624
00:47:00,475 --> 00:47:02,492
His arrest was
favored by the Roman Governor,

625
00:47:02,578 --> 00:47:03,777
and the temple priests.

626
00:47:03,829 --> 00:47:06,813
Do they in Jerusalem
dictate what is done here?

627
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:09,032
They would tax the
air we breathe?

628
00:47:09,118 --> 00:47:12,085
What you ask
of me is beyond reason.

629
00:47:12,154 --> 00:47:15,422
The Baptist cannot be released.

630
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:16,612
Isaac.

631
00:47:17,926 --> 00:47:19,926
Isaac!
Come!

632
00:47:21,847 --> 00:47:24,131
We shall have no
place in this house.

633
00:47:35,861 --> 00:47:37,611
You saw her shame.

634
00:47:37,679 --> 00:47:40,230
Until now I've seen the Baptist
as a threat to myself

635
00:47:40,315 --> 00:47:42,482
and to our future rule.

636
00:47:42,534 --> 00:47:44,985
Now I must suffer my
daughter's disgrace?

637
00:47:45,037 --> 00:47:46,953
There will
be other suitors. Mmmm...

638
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:49,740
Kill him.

639
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:52,709
Claim he choked on a fish bone.

640
00:47:52,795 --> 00:47:58,081
If I ruled, I'd kill him
and all who follow him.

641
00:47:58,167 --> 00:48:01,201
I know
that voice.

642
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:02,535
My father.

643
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:04,337
And how
I wish you were he.

644
00:48:19,188 --> 00:48:21,738
We are taxed to
death, how are we to eat?

645
00:48:22,825 --> 00:48:24,524
Pay Up,
Pay!

646
00:48:26,728 --> 00:48:27,911
Hey, That Man.

647
00:48:28,747 --> 00:48:30,363
Hey jew..
Come on.

648
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:33,466
Come on...

649
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:37,537
Tell him I want
to dine in his home.

650
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:41,341
He'll refuse.

651
00:48:41,409 --> 00:48:43,760
The tax collector has
no place with God.

652
00:48:43,846 --> 00:48:44,878
He'll not refuse.

653
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:53,186
My master wishes to dine
at your house this evening.

654
00:48:53,255 --> 00:48:54,387
Me?

655
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:56,056
Why?

656
00:48:56,108 --> 00:48:58,058
Ask him.

657
00:48:58,110 --> 00:48:59,443
My answer would give offense.

658
00:49:06,452 --> 00:49:07,734
Why him?

659
00:49:07,786 --> 00:49:10,570
God has no love for
those who tax us.

660
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:16,293
I'm not
worthy to offer you my table.

661
00:49:16,378 --> 00:49:20,947
Who admits his faults,
and seeks forgiveness

662
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:22,666
will find redemption.

663
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:25,135
Look into your hearts
and you will know this.

664
00:49:27,455 --> 00:49:28,788
I am hungry.

665
00:49:28,841 --> 00:49:29,940
Invite me to your home.

666
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:51,411
You are young, and
supple, you are as men desire.

667
00:49:51,479 --> 00:49:53,280
None come
seeking my hand.

668
00:49:57,319 --> 00:49:58,385
Go on.

669
00:49:59,454 --> 00:50:02,155
We must be careful.

670
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:05,292
The Baptist has
followers even here.

671
00:50:05,344 --> 00:50:07,344
He is a curse upon us.

672
00:50:07,429 --> 00:50:10,830
At fault is
my husband's weakness.

673
00:50:10,883 --> 00:50:14,017
Unless our weakness is
failing to use his weakness.

674
00:50:17,689 --> 00:50:20,006
When I'm made ready for sleep,

675
00:50:20,058 --> 00:50:22,943
your husband lingers
outside my room.

676
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:29,149
While he once pledged
to care for you as his own.

677
00:50:30,619 --> 00:50:32,452
That's the beauty you've become.

678
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:34,988
I'll address this with him.

679
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:36,373
No.

680
00:50:36,458 --> 00:50:38,992
His lust is repulsive.

681
00:50:39,044 --> 00:50:40,961
But perhaps useful.

682
00:50:46,718 --> 00:50:48,468
Oh.

683
00:51:07,651 --> 00:51:08,951
Unclean.

684
00:51:09,234 --> 00:51:11,985
A leper woman.

685
00:51:12,053 --> 00:51:15,321
Rabbi...

686
00:51:15,390 --> 00:51:17,156
Rabbi cleanse me please!

687
00:51:17,225 --> 00:51:18,224
I was here before you!

688
00:51:18,276 --> 00:51:21,411
Please! Rabbi...

689
00:51:21,496 --> 00:51:23,346
Rabbi please!!

690
00:51:23,398 --> 00:51:24,448
John, draw them water.

691
00:51:24,532 --> 00:51:25,481
- But they're lepers.
- Water.

692
00:51:27,785 --> 00:51:28,818
Drink. Drink.

693
00:51:28,838 --> 00:51:32,223
No. No. No.
Don't drink this.

694
00:51:32,406 --> 00:51:34,156
Bring them some water.

695
00:51:34,241 --> 00:51:35,941
Judas.

696
00:51:35,993 --> 00:51:37,114
Let me look at you.

697
00:51:54,712 --> 00:51:56,512
What is your name?

698
00:51:56,597 --> 00:51:57,629
I'm called Mary.

699
00:51:57,681 --> 00:51:59,298
My mother's name.

700
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:00,494
Come sit please.

701
00:52:00,494 --> 00:52:01,884
What is your son's name?

702
00:52:01,969 --> 00:52:03,101
His name is Judah.

703
00:52:03,171 --> 00:52:04,304
Judah.

704
00:52:04,355 --> 00:52:05,670
How old is Judah?

705
00:52:05,723 --> 00:52:06,838
12.

706
00:52:06,891 --> 00:52:08,140
May I touch you?

707
00:52:08,192 --> 00:52:10,225
Gently.

708
00:52:10,311 --> 00:52:12,895
You are without fear Mary?

709
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:15,353
I don't fear disease of
the skin or the flesh.

710
00:52:16,367 --> 00:52:17,816
Only disease of the spirit.

711
00:52:20,037 --> 00:52:23,405
Ah, it's
something you've known.

712
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:25,574
I'm from Magdala.

713
00:52:25,659 --> 00:52:26,742
Do you know Magdala?

714
00:52:29,863 --> 00:52:32,530
A barracks town
for Roman troops.

715
00:52:32,583 --> 00:52:35,913
Where Jewish daughters are enslaved to
pay the tax debts of their families.

716
00:52:38,255 --> 00:52:41,006
You would see an
end to such suffering.

717
00:52:41,058 --> 00:52:42,674
I'm
told it's your purpose.

718
00:52:42,726 --> 00:52:46,678
Oh be certain it
is Mary from Magdala.

719
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:49,064
Then my
purpose must be serving you.

720
00:52:53,187 --> 00:52:54,853
Thank you.

721
00:52:58,108 --> 00:53:01,410
Blessed are the poor in
spirit

722
00:53:01,495 --> 00:53:04,913
for theirs is the kingdom of
heaven.

723
00:53:04,999 --> 00:53:09,734
Blessed are those who mourn,
for they will be comforted.

724
00:53:09,787 --> 00:53:14,506
Blessed are the meek, for
they will inherit the earth.

725
00:53:14,574 --> 00:53:19,411
Blessed are those who
hunger and thirst...

726
00:53:19,463 --> 00:53:21,013
Is
it the Nazarene who speaks?

727
00:53:21,081 --> 00:53:22,464
Yes.

728
00:53:22,549 --> 00:53:25,183
And those who should be tending
my fields are here bewitched

729
00:53:25,252 --> 00:53:27,135
by him.

730
00:53:27,221 --> 00:53:30,772
Blessed are those
persecuted

731
00:53:30,858 --> 00:53:32,441
for their righteousness,

732
00:53:32,526 --> 00:53:37,396
for theirs is the kingdom
of heaven?

733
00:53:37,448 --> 00:53:44,486
Your father knows your needs,
knows them before you ask.

734
00:53:44,571 --> 00:53:46,738
So this then is how
you should pray.

735
00:53:51,378 --> 00:53:57,082
Our Father in Heaven,
hallowed be your name.

736
00:53:58,218 --> 00:54:02,087
Your kingdom come,
your will be done,

737
00:54:02,139 --> 00:54:06,558
on earth as it is in heaven.

738
00:54:06,626 --> 00:54:14,232
Give us this day our daily
bread, forgive us our debts,

739
00:54:14,301 --> 00:54:17,436
as we also forgive our debtors.

740
00:54:17,488 --> 00:54:23,108
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

741
00:54:24,161 --> 00:54:27,863
For yours is the Kingdom,

742
00:54:27,948 --> 00:54:30,332
the power

743
00:54:30,417 --> 00:54:32,751
and the glory.

744
00:54:32,819 --> 00:54:34,252
Forever.

745
00:54:34,321 --> 00:54:35,563
Amen.

746
00:54:42,496 --> 00:54:43,595
Governor,

747
00:54:43,663 --> 00:54:46,264
I saw huge crowds of men
enraptured as he spoke

748
00:54:46,333 --> 00:54:50,018
his platitudes in the crude
accent of some Galilean peasant.

749
00:54:50,104 --> 00:54:53,071
They wept, were overcome
believing he is the Messiah

750
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:55,357
come to bring God's wrath
upon Rome.

751
00:54:55,442 --> 00:54:57,943
And what is more,
we've learned he's a cousin

752
00:54:58,011 --> 00:54:59,778
of the Baptist.

753
00:54:59,846 --> 00:55:02,030
We're being
menaced by a family of lunatics.

754
00:55:02,116 --> 00:55:04,399
There's
real danger here.

755
00:55:04,485 --> 00:55:06,568
If he could rally zealots
to free the Baptist,

756
00:55:06,653 --> 00:55:10,655
there could be an
uprising in Galilee.

757
00:55:10,708 --> 00:55:12,023
What's
his name, this man?

758
00:55:12,076 --> 00:55:13,375
Jesus of Nazareth.

759
00:55:16,696 --> 00:55:19,748
His cousin the Baptist should
be killed without delay.

760
00:55:19,833 --> 00:55:23,034
That undercuts any
thoughts of freeing him,

761
00:55:23,087 --> 00:55:25,387
and also makes this Jesus aware
of the fate

762
00:55:25,472 --> 00:55:26,671
that could well await him.

763
00:55:31,678 --> 00:55:32,928
Leave.

764
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:37,399
Finally.

765
00:55:37,484 --> 00:55:38,550
Meaning?

766
00:55:38,602 --> 00:55:39,684
Pilot's blessing

767
00:55:41,739 --> 00:55:42,854
...kill the Baptist.

768
00:55:44,858 --> 00:55:47,075
Killing him is a
convenience for the Roman.

769
00:55:47,161 --> 00:55:48,744
Not for me.

770
00:55:48,829 --> 00:55:51,563
I'm already vilified for
imprisoning the Baptist,

771
00:55:51,615 --> 00:55:54,533
kill him and all of
Galilee turns against me.

772
00:55:54,585 --> 00:55:57,335
Pontius Pilate's
praise of you to Caesar

773
00:55:57,404 --> 00:55:59,171
could make you king.

774
00:55:59,239 --> 00:56:01,840
What I see is Pilate
praising what serves Pilate.

775
00:56:01,908 --> 00:56:04,709
If he wants the Baptist dead,
let him drag him to Jerusalem

776
00:56:04,762 --> 00:56:07,763
and nail him to the cross.

777
00:56:07,848 --> 00:56:09,965
So you are
set on doing nothing.

778
00:56:13,637 --> 00:56:16,388
Salome told me you asked her
to dance at the feast

779
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:19,524
for your birthday tonight.

780
00:56:19,593 --> 00:56:21,810
Did she also
tell you that she refused?

781
00:56:21,895 --> 00:56:24,396
She's not a performer
from the market place.

782
00:56:24,448 --> 00:56:28,066
You must offer her something.

783
00:56:28,118 --> 00:56:30,068
Meaning ... she
is her mother's daughter.

784
00:56:32,272 --> 00:56:33,572
We like our rewards.

785
00:56:35,576 --> 00:56:39,294
And what would hers
be for entertaining my guests?

786
00:56:41,298 --> 00:56:46,168
Suppose I tell her
that whatever she asks for

787
00:56:46,253 --> 00:56:48,086
you will not refuse.

788
00:56:48,138 --> 00:56:49,888
She must dance
to my satisfaction.

789
00:56:52,009 --> 00:56:53,842
Be certain she will.

790
00:57:26,126 --> 00:57:28,043
You remember your promise.

791
00:57:31,765 --> 00:57:34,432
Salome, tell him.

792
00:57:51,351 --> 00:57:54,119
Show Caesar you're a man.

793
00:57:54,187 --> 00:57:55,487
And show us too.

794
00:58:09,753 --> 00:58:10,989
Salome...

795
00:58:11,871 --> 00:58:12,969
Leave it...

796
00:58:44,204 --> 00:58:45,370
Ahhh!!!

797
00:58:49,409 --> 00:58:50,759
Uhhhh....

798
00:58:52,412 --> 00:58:53,712
Ohhh!!!

799
00:59:01,484 --> 00:59:02,549
Rabbi!

800
00:59:04,738 --> 00:59:07,455
Thomas and
Andrew welcome.

801
00:59:09,543 --> 00:59:10,742
They've murdered him.

802
00:59:11,361 --> 00:59:12,377
Cut his head off.

803
00:59:15,532 --> 00:59:16,548
Beheaded?

804
00:59:24,224 --> 00:59:27,142
You are with us
now, you and Thomas.

805
00:59:27,210 --> 00:59:29,010
Come eat with us.

806
00:59:44,728 --> 00:59:50,165
Yes, as John has said,
the cup has come to my lips...

807
00:59:57,907 --> 00:59:59,874
I fear its bitterness, Father.

808
01:00:05,132 --> 01:00:06,931
Give me the strength
to welcome it.

809
01:00:27,204 --> 01:00:28,570
Who am I?

810
01:00:28,622 --> 01:00:29,635
What am I?

811
01:00:32,442 --> 01:00:34,459
How do people call
the son of man?

812
01:00:37,831 --> 01:00:39,297
Tell me?

813
01:00:39,383 --> 01:00:42,167
Tell me.

814
01:00:42,252 --> 01:00:46,471
For me ... you are a
giver of courage to act

815
01:00:46,556 --> 01:00:48,256
as I never imagined.

816
01:00:49,476 --> 01:00:53,478
Reaching out for the sick
...the unclean

817
01:00:53,563 --> 01:00:54,796
...without fear.

818
01:00:54,848 --> 01:00:56,264
But Judas,
how am I called?

819
01:00:56,316 --> 01:00:58,983
I've heard you
called coming of Elijah.

820
01:01:00,687 --> 01:01:02,904
A prophet.

821
01:01:02,972 --> 01:01:04,305
What else is said?

822
01:01:04,357 --> 01:01:07,442
Many will believe you're
the Baptist risen from the dead.

823
01:01:07,494 --> 01:01:09,194
There was no
greater prophet than John.

824
01:01:12,582 --> 01:01:16,785
But you, you who see
me eat, sleep, wash,

825
01:01:16,837 --> 01:01:20,121
know my ever gesture, my
moods, who do you say I am?

826
01:01:34,604 --> 01:01:35,806
You're the anointed one.

827
01:01:38,975 --> 01:01:40,341
Son

828
01:01:40,393 --> 01:01:41,609
...of the living God.

829
01:01:46,483 --> 01:01:51,152
Bless you
Simon, Son of Jonah.

830
01:01:51,204 --> 01:01:52,821
No other has said this.

831
01:01:55,358 --> 01:01:57,792
I think it was revealed to
you by my heavenly Father.

832
01:01:59,296 --> 01:02:01,863
It is simply
what I believe.

833
01:02:01,915 --> 01:02:04,699
From now on
I'll call you Peter.

834
01:02:04,751 --> 01:02:06,634
Peter?

835
01:02:06,703 --> 01:02:08,169
In Greek,
Peter means rock.

836
01:02:10,924 --> 01:02:14,642
And on this rock,
I'll build my church

837
01:02:14,711 --> 01:02:17,095
and give you the keys to the
kingdom of heaven.

838
01:02:22,652 --> 01:02:23,823
I must be alone now.

839
01:02:32,245 --> 01:02:33,912
You believe he's...

840
01:02:33,997 --> 01:02:36,698
The Messiah.

841
01:02:36,750 --> 01:02:40,234
Take great
care saying that.

842
01:02:40,287 --> 01:02:43,538
What harm will
come to God's chosen?

843
01:03:05,445 --> 01:03:06,761
Before these Counsel

844
01:03:06,813 --> 01:03:10,315
of the Sanhedrin proceeds to
judgment I should tell you

845
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,901
we have been warned that

846
01:03:12,953 --> 01:03:16,454
the Nazarene Jesus has come
to Jerusalem.

847
01:03:16,540 --> 01:03:20,625
It is proposed that we forbid
him to enter

848
01:03:20,710 --> 01:03:23,745
our holy house of God.

849
01:03:23,797 --> 01:03:25,780
Yes. Yes.

850
01:03:25,832 --> 01:03:28,950
No. No. No. No.

851
01:03:29,002 --> 01:03:31,986
We
may dispute his words,

852
01:03:32,055 --> 01:03:36,174
but we cannot deny a devout
Jew entry to the temple.

853
01:03:38,094 --> 01:03:41,062
I ... I have heard
Jesus speak and he is to be

854
01:03:41,130 --> 01:03:43,131
welcomed, not shunned.

855
01:03:43,183 --> 01:03:45,149
Allow
him ... allow him in.

856
01:03:48,238 --> 01:03:49,520
Deny Him.

857
01:03:51,441 --> 01:03:58,746
So, the Nazarene
enters this very room.

858
01:03:58,815 --> 01:04:04,919
Where his name is spoken,
dissention follows.

859
01:04:04,988 --> 01:04:06,170
Allow him.

860
01:04:06,256 --> 01:04:08,289
He
must be allowed entry.

861
01:04:08,341 --> 01:04:09,591
He is a Jew.

862
01:04:09,659 --> 01:04:10,792
Like us.

863
01:04:10,844 --> 01:04:15,263
But I'll not
push to forbid him entry.

864
01:04:15,331 --> 01:04:20,268
I only recall Jeremiah's
warning of false prophets.

865
01:04:20,336 --> 01:04:23,221
They fill you with false hopes.

866
01:04:23,306 --> 01:04:27,174
They speak visions
from their own minds.

867
01:04:27,227 --> 01:04:29,944
Not from the mouth of the Lord.

868
01:04:30,013 --> 01:04:32,513
When Jesus says the meek
shall inherit the earth,

869
01:04:32,565 --> 01:04:35,950
there's nothing meek about him,
nor those that follow him.

870
01:04:36,019 --> 01:04:39,353
But it's true they seek
to inherit the earth.

871
01:04:39,406 --> 01:04:41,956
Allow
him, allow him in!

872
01:04:42,025 --> 01:04:43,207
It's the law.

873
01:04:43,293 --> 01:04:45,793
ALLOW HIM! ALLOW HIM!

874
01:04:48,748 --> 01:04:49,914
We have lost.

875
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,700
Let the Nazarene come.

876
01:04:52,752 --> 01:04:55,503
With luck he may
condemn himself.

877
01:04:55,555 --> 01:04:57,138
Bring the woman.

878
01:04:59,643 --> 01:05:04,262
We are now to hear and judge the
case of a woman who had defiled

879
01:05:04,347 --> 01:05:07,381
the sacred covenants
of marriage.

880
01:05:07,434 --> 01:05:13,354
And thus brought great shame
upon her husband's house.

881
01:05:46,473 --> 01:05:47,638
What shall we do?

882
01:05:47,724 --> 01:05:48,723
Let the guards take him away?

883
01:05:48,810 --> 01:05:49,774
We're enacting a law.

884
01:05:49,859 --> 01:05:51,142
I want you to provoke him.

885
01:05:54,397 --> 01:05:55,780
We
stand here ready to enact

886
01:05:55,865 --> 01:05:58,700
the Law of Moses, an adulteress
condemned by the High Court

887
01:05:58,768 --> 01:06:00,985
of the Temple is to be stoned.

888
01:06:01,071 --> 01:06:03,955
A punishment called
for by Moses.

889
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:06,157
Do you deny the law
revealed on Mount Sinai?

890
01:06:08,945 --> 01:06:10,828
She has sinned.

891
01:06:10,914 --> 01:06:12,663
And been judged.

892
01:06:12,749 --> 01:06:15,416
Do you oppose the
law of the Torah?

893
01:06:19,923 --> 01:06:23,958
Is his silence a defense
of her fornications?

894
01:06:24,010 --> 01:06:25,343
Her harlotry?

895
01:06:27,296 --> 01:06:31,315
I know you, Jesus of Nazareth.

896
01:06:31,401 --> 01:06:34,018
You have opinions on everything.

897
01:06:34,104 --> 01:06:36,437
What's his opinion on this?

898
01:06:43,613 --> 01:06:46,697
Any among you
who is without sin,

899
01:06:46,783 --> 01:06:49,450
let him be the first
to cast a stone at her.

900
01:06:52,488 --> 01:06:54,255
Any among you who
is without sin?

901
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:02,346
God
has set forth the law not him.

902
01:07:02,432 --> 01:07:05,299
The law must be carried out.

903
01:07:05,351 --> 01:07:06,667
Kill her.

904
01:07:10,673 --> 01:07:12,056
Here, kill her.

905
01:07:17,530 --> 01:07:18,980
You kill her.

906
01:07:31,628 --> 01:07:32,827
I cannot.

907
01:07:36,082 --> 01:07:37,965
Then neither can I.

908
01:07:48,211 --> 01:07:51,545
I have
begged for forgiveness.

909
01:08:05,561 --> 01:08:07,078
Go and sin no more.

910
01:08:12,902 --> 01:08:15,736
We are the law.

911
01:08:15,788 --> 01:08:19,924
We will see you accused
judged and punished for this.

912
01:08:34,930 --> 01:08:37,444
To maintain the order that
your office demands

913
01:08:37,455 --> 01:08:40,006
we must have obedience to our
laws.

914
01:08:40,047 --> 01:08:44,949
Now this man, this false
claimant to religious stature

915
01:08:45,002 --> 01:08:48,753
has thwarted the legal
execution of an adulteress.

916
01:08:48,911 --> 01:08:50,995
You have a
court, try him, stone him.

917
01:08:51,063 --> 01:08:52,747
Yes that would of
course be my first thought,

918
01:08:52,832 --> 01:08:55,366
but with shame I must
say that even among us,

919
01:08:55,418 --> 01:08:58,369
even among the Sanhedrin
are those he has corrupted.

920
01:08:58,421 --> 01:09:00,070
My laws are Roman.

921
01:09:00,123 --> 01:09:01,922
His crime is not Sedition.

922
01:09:02,008 --> 01:09:03,240
Is it not.

923
01:09:03,292 --> 01:09:05,626
He rails against Roman taxes.

924
01:09:05,712 --> 01:09:07,962
If I were to
crucify every Jew

925
01:09:08,047 --> 01:09:09,513
who rails against our taxes,

926
01:09:09,582 --> 01:09:12,600
I would have to level the
Cedars of Lebanon for wood.

927
01:09:16,773 --> 01:09:19,890
His crime must be an attack
against our Emperor, our rule.

928
01:09:19,942 --> 01:09:21,692
He attacks those
who support your rule,

929
01:09:21,761 --> 01:09:23,310
does that not inspire concern.

930
01:09:23,396 --> 01:09:25,980
Concern, but
nothing that validates action.

931
01:09:26,065 --> 01:09:28,983
Make a case for
Sedition, with evidence.

932
01:09:29,068 --> 01:09:31,819
Learn where he
speaks and with whom.

933
01:09:31,904 --> 01:09:36,323
Prove that he is a threat to
Roman rule

934
01:09:36,409 --> 01:09:38,325
...and I will have him
crucified.

935
01:09:42,715 --> 01:09:44,915
Each day I hear the
servants speaking of him.

936
01:09:47,837 --> 01:09:50,805
What is the message
of this Jesus?

937
01:09:50,890 --> 01:09:53,123
Many things.

938
01:09:53,176 --> 01:09:55,292
Nothing that concerns us.

939
01:09:55,344 --> 01:09:57,595
What?

940
01:09:57,647 --> 01:09:59,930
It'll
bore the slaves.

941
01:09:59,982 --> 01:10:01,682
The curse of being
a slave is boredom

942
01:10:01,768 --> 01:10:02,966
with what we do.

943
01:10:05,521 --> 01:10:07,071
Not all we do.

944
01:10:09,609 --> 01:10:12,309
Enough!

945
01:10:12,361 --> 01:10:14,779
What does he preach?

946
01:10:14,831 --> 01:10:18,783
That God wants
the meek to inherit the earth.

947
01:10:18,835 --> 01:10:21,485
The poor to be rich.

948
01:10:21,537 --> 01:10:23,788
The weak to be strong.

949
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:27,591
Platitudes of popular appeal.

950
01:10:27,660 --> 01:10:29,326
None of
it to be believed?

951
01:10:29,378 --> 01:10:31,679
Well it
flies in the face of history.

952
01:10:31,764 --> 01:10:35,466
Caesarea is named
after a conqueror.

953
01:10:35,518 --> 01:10:37,134
To the south of
us is Alexandria,

954
01:10:37,186 --> 01:10:39,887
also named for a conqueror.

955
01:10:39,972 --> 01:10:45,342
If there really is one
single ... all powerful God,

956
01:10:45,394 --> 01:10:51,282
as Jesus and these Jews claim,
he clearly favors the strong,

957
01:10:51,350 --> 01:10:52,983
over the weak.

958
01:10:55,071 --> 01:10:58,155
Things are as the Gods intend.

959
01:11:00,877 --> 01:11:06,747
The meek such as this lovely
creature

960
01:11:06,833 --> 01:11:09,300
will never inherit the earth.

961
01:11:13,205 --> 01:11:14,638
HA!

962
01:11:20,096 --> 01:11:24,315
This man Jesus he has
drawn many to cast away

963
01:11:24,383 --> 01:11:26,901
their wealth to follow him.

964
01:11:26,986 --> 01:11:29,186
He lures sane
men from their wealth?

965
01:11:29,238 --> 01:11:31,989
He speaks of
a time, soon coming,

966
01:11:32,057 --> 01:11:34,441
when rich men will be poor.

967
01:11:34,527 --> 01:11:40,063
Powerful men cast down and ...
the Temple itself destroyed

968
01:11:40,116 --> 01:11:41,832
by God's wrath.

969
01:11:41,901 --> 01:11:44,201
The Priests are right,
this Nazarene is a menace.

970
01:11:46,906 --> 01:11:48,572
Search among your ranks,

971
01:11:48,624 --> 01:11:51,408
Chuza, find those who are most
trustworthy.

972
01:11:52,244 --> 01:11:55,212
All information about this
Nazarene is of value to me.

973
01:12:07,092 --> 01:12:08,776
Matthew!

974
01:12:08,861 --> 01:12:11,562
Far from the old days when
squeezing taxes from peasants

975
01:12:11,614 --> 01:12:14,932
was like ringing
water from stones.

976
01:12:14,984 --> 01:12:16,483
How astonished I was to hear
that you'd given up

977
01:12:16,569 --> 01:12:19,486
all your wealth to follow the
Nazarene.

978
01:12:19,572 --> 01:12:21,071
Who is he?

979
01:12:21,123 --> 01:12:24,291
A tax
collector who feels as

980
01:12:24,377 --> 01:12:28,879
Matthew once did. Regretting
what he must do.

981
01:12:28,948 --> 01:12:30,247
And you would be?

982
01:12:30,299 --> 01:12:32,499
Judas Iscariot.

983
01:12:32,585 --> 01:12:34,635
I'm Asher.

984
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:37,221
And your caution
is well advised.

985
01:12:37,289 --> 01:12:41,091
The Nazarene's fame
breeds envy even hatred.

986
01:12:41,143 --> 01:12:43,627
But I for one admire the
choice that you've made.

987
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:45,128
Change your ways.

988
01:12:45,181 --> 01:12:46,397
And follow us.

989
01:12:46,465 --> 01:12:47,648
How I wish.

990
01:12:47,733 --> 01:12:49,733
How I wish, but the
burden of hungry mouths.

991
01:12:49,802 --> 01:12:51,602
And the burden
of a fine horse?

992
01:12:51,654 --> 01:12:53,153
Yes.

993
01:12:53,239 --> 01:12:55,489
I admit weakness.

994
01:12:55,574 --> 01:12:57,691
Isn't that one step
towards redemption?

995
01:13:00,663 --> 01:13:04,949
It is said that the Rabbi goes
to Jerusalem for Passover.

996
01:13:05,001 --> 01:13:06,316
It's his intention.

997
01:13:06,369 --> 01:13:07,663
I know of a dwelling there.

998
01:13:07,753 --> 01:13:08,836
I have well placed friends.

999
01:13:08,921 --> 01:13:10,788
A place has been offered.

1000
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:12,873
Is the
dwelling within the city?

1001
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:14,875
I may seek you out Matthew.

1002
01:13:14,961 --> 01:13:17,211
A morning's
walk from the gate.

1003
01:13:17,296 --> 01:13:21,715
Home of a land owner, Lazarus.

1004
01:13:21,801 --> 01:13:23,801
God speed your journey.

1005
01:13:28,391 --> 01:13:30,724
I have urgent news for
the Tetrarch's steward.

1006
01:13:30,810 --> 01:13:32,064
Open the gates.

1007
01:13:36,983 --> 01:13:38,047
Asher.

1008
01:13:38,107 --> 01:13:40,617
Send word to the Tetrarch,
I have news of the Nazarene.

1009
01:13:40,686 --> 01:13:42,987
And be ready to open
your coffers, Chuza,

1010
01:13:43,039 --> 01:13:45,689
what I bring is of great value.

1011
01:13:45,741 --> 01:13:47,708
Jesus is staying outside
the city at the house

1012
01:13:47,793 --> 01:13:49,660
of a land owner named Lazarus.

1013
01:13:49,712 --> 01:13:52,246
He can't be arrested
there too many people.

1014
01:13:52,331 --> 01:13:55,049
We must know his movements
when he comes to Jerusalem.

1015
01:13:55,134 --> 01:13:56,867
We need somewhere quiet.

1016
01:13:56,919 --> 01:13:58,302
I'll put a watch on the house.

1017
01:14:08,764 --> 01:14:10,547
Outside the wall
dressed as pilgrims,

1018
01:14:10,599 --> 01:14:13,434
spies are watching us.

1019
01:14:13,519 --> 01:14:16,186
To report on our
drunkenness, hey Lazarus?

1020
01:14:18,223 --> 01:14:20,223
My debauchery.

1021
01:14:20,276 --> 01:14:23,660
That I consort with sinners and
tax collectors, right Matthew?

1022
01:14:23,729 --> 01:14:26,080
Former sinner
and tax collector.

1023
01:14:26,165 --> 01:14:29,166
And I
know the labels put on me.

1024
01:14:29,234 --> 01:14:30,617
We will
put them on trial?

1025
01:14:30,703 --> 01:14:32,086
Put whom on trial?

1026
01:14:32,171 --> 01:14:33,287
Them.

1027
01:14:33,372 --> 01:14:35,238
Those who are against us.

1028
01:14:35,291 --> 01:14:39,076
When you're king, James
and I wish to sit by your throne

1029
01:14:39,128 --> 01:14:41,078
as sentence is passed on them.

1030
01:14:41,130 --> 01:14:43,263
See you condemn
them to eternal flames.

1031
01:14:47,470 --> 01:14:51,138
That's how you
imagine the kingdom of God?

1032
01:14:51,223 --> 01:14:54,391
Me on a throne?

1033
01:14:54,443 --> 01:14:56,426
Do I wear a gold crown?

1034
01:14:56,479 --> 01:14:59,480
I would think a
crown of the purest gold.

1035
01:14:59,565 --> 01:15:02,599
What, like
some earthly king?

1036
01:15:02,651 --> 01:15:06,286
Do I preside over
lackeys and ring kissers?

1037
01:15:06,498 --> 01:15:08,915
I mean you travel with me, your
ears are open to every word,

1038
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,900
but you hear nothing.

1039
01:15:10,952 --> 01:15:13,253
Nothing.

1040
01:15:13,338 --> 01:15:16,873
Have you so failed to understand
being who I am, what I must do?

1041
01:15:19,127 --> 01:15:22,045
Whoever would be a master,
must first be a slave.

1042
01:15:22,097 --> 01:15:25,048
Who wants to be served
must first serve.

1043
01:15:25,100 --> 01:15:28,468
I am here to give my life
as a ransom for the many.

1044
01:15:28,553 --> 01:15:32,355
In the Kingdom of God there
are no thrones, no crowns,

1045
01:15:32,423 --> 01:15:34,557
no rule of nations.

1046
01:15:34,609 --> 01:15:38,311
My reward for earthly
service will be suffering.

1047
01:15:38,396 --> 01:15:39,812
Understand that.

1048
01:15:39,898 --> 01:15:42,282
Suffering.

1049
01:15:42,367 --> 01:15:44,367
To bring the message
of God's love,

1050
01:15:44,435 --> 01:15:47,403
I am the resurrection
and the life.

1051
01:15:47,455 --> 01:15:50,773
And those who believe in me,
even though they die, will live.

1052
01:16:02,062 --> 01:16:04,095
If you
are praying I will leave.

1053
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:06,594
I came here to pray.

1054
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:08,980
Pray to control my anger
and my frustration.

1055
01:16:12,012 --> 01:16:16,164
But then I heard my father's
voice in that song,

1056
01:16:16,216 --> 01:16:19,667
in the sweetness of that song.

1057
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:22,604
Mhmmm...

1058
01:16:22,673 --> 01:16:24,840
Your anger is gone.

1059
01:16:28,112 --> 01:16:32,180
Do you know the prophets? What they
say awaits the one God has sent?

1060
01:16:32,232 --> 01:16:33,531
There was little
talk of prophets

1061
01:16:33,617 --> 01:16:35,150
in the barracks of Magdala.

1062
01:16:36,570 --> 01:16:38,453
Well, you know my words.

1063
01:16:38,521 --> 01:16:40,622
Yes.

1064
01:16:40,690 --> 01:16:41,882
And that's enough.

1065
01:16:45,195 --> 01:16:46,211
Yes...

1066
01:16:46,997 --> 01:16:49,164
Then I'll leave
you to pray.

1067
01:16:50,834 --> 01:16:53,368
Mary.

1068
01:16:53,420 --> 01:16:57,505
The cup from which I must
drink, how very bitter it is.

1069
01:17:01,378 --> 01:17:02,727
Go Mary of Magdala.

1070
01:17:35,345 --> 01:17:36,428
What is this?

1071
01:17:36,513 --> 01:17:38,797
This beast is little
more than a yearling.

1072
01:17:38,882 --> 01:17:40,799
He told us to
find a donkey colt.

1073
01:17:40,884 --> 01:17:42,384
Prophecy of Zachariah.

1074
01:17:42,436 --> 01:17:45,420
He enters Jerusalem
on that for Passover?

1075
01:17:45,472 --> 01:17:47,555
The Messiah will arrive at
the holy city astride

1076
01:17:47,607 --> 01:17:49,757
a donkey colt.

1077
01:17:49,810 --> 01:17:51,443
Now he acts
out a prophecy.

1078
01:17:51,528 --> 01:17:52,560
Why should he not?

1079
01:17:55,115 --> 01:17:57,649
What more is there in the
prophecy of the Messiah's coming?

1080
01:18:00,620 --> 01:18:02,120
Say it.

1081
01:18:02,205 --> 01:18:03,905
We all share however it goes.

1082
01:18:05,542 --> 01:18:08,076
The Messiah will
be falsely accused.

1083
01:18:08,128 --> 01:18:09,110
He'll be beaten.

1084
01:18:09,162 --> 01:18:10,445
Spat upon.

1085
01:18:10,497 --> 01:18:11,946
He'll be killed. And all those
who love him will look on

1086
01:18:11,999 --> 01:18:15,583
unable to stop the agony.

1087
01:18:15,635 --> 01:18:16,668
And those who follow him?

1088
01:18:25,178 --> 01:18:26,261
I see.

1089
01:18:52,873 --> 01:18:54,205
I'm told of a great Rabbi

1090
01:18:54,291 --> 01:18:56,824
who was asked to recite the
Torah while standing on one leg.

1091
01:18:58,328 --> 01:19:00,995
He said, 'do not unto others as
you would not have them do

1092
01:19:01,048 --> 01:19:04,549
unto you.' This is the true
wisdom of the Torah.

1093
01:19:04,634 --> 01:19:06,468
The rest is all commentary.

1094
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:08,553
Go and learn it.

1095
01:19:08,638 --> 01:19:10,438
Do
you share his belief?

1096
01:19:10,507 --> 01:19:11,723
I do.

1097
01:19:11,808 --> 01:19:17,028
Saying simply, love your
neighbor as you love yourself.

1098
01:19:17,114 --> 01:19:20,315
But I put one commandment
even before this.

1099
01:19:20,367 --> 01:19:24,402
Hear, oh Israel, the
Lord our God is one.

1100
01:19:24,488 --> 01:19:26,521
Love the Lord your God
with all your heart,

1101
01:19:26,573 --> 01:19:29,290
your mind and your
strength, saying this,

1102
01:19:29,359 --> 01:19:30,858
you are close to
the Kingdom of God.

1103
01:19:30,911 --> 01:19:32,210
Rabbi.

1104
01:19:32,295 --> 01:19:33,962
While some oppose you.

1105
01:19:34,030 --> 01:19:36,581
The wisdom of your
words is not lost on us.

1106
01:19:36,666 --> 01:19:40,468
Rabbi, what say you of taxes?

1107
01:19:40,537 --> 01:19:46,040
Should Jews pay taxes
to this man in Rome?

1108
01:19:46,093 --> 01:19:48,726
What do you say Rabbi?

1109
01:19:48,812 --> 01:19:50,812
Give him an answer Rabbi.

1110
01:19:56,019 --> 01:19:57,602
Let me see the coin.

1111
01:20:05,412 --> 01:20:06,744
Who is this?

1112
01:20:06,830 --> 01:20:09,414
You know.

1113
01:20:09,499 --> 01:20:12,283
That's Caesar Tiberius.

1114
01:20:12,369 --> 01:20:14,702
What do you think?

1115
01:20:14,754 --> 01:20:18,006
Should Jews pay taxes to Caesar?

1116
01:20:23,763 --> 01:20:27,265
Give to Caesar
that which is Caesar's,

1117
01:20:27,350 --> 01:20:30,969
and give unto God
that which is God's.

1118
01:20:33,607 --> 01:20:36,391
Leave in
peace, Lamb of God.

1119
01:20:39,613 --> 01:20:43,031
Their Lamb of God
will be our lamb of sacrifice.

1120
01:20:53,543 --> 01:20:57,111
That you still
read by the light of a flame.

1121
01:20:57,164 --> 01:20:59,581
I envy you your
sharpness of vision.

1122
01:20:59,633 --> 01:21:02,133
The characters are blurred.

1123
01:21:02,219 --> 01:21:05,420
But I know the entire scriptures
by heart and I find it curiously

1124
01:21:05,472 --> 01:21:08,806
comforting to actually
hold them in my hand.

1125
01:21:11,678 --> 01:21:16,097
It is almost your time to start
your duties in the temple and

1126
01:21:16,149 --> 01:21:17,465
you have not slept.

1127
01:21:17,517 --> 01:21:20,468
I have ... failed you.

1128
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:24,072
I've failed the temple.

1129
01:21:24,140 --> 01:21:28,976
When Passover ends, the
Nazarene, he will leave,

1130
01:21:29,029 --> 01:21:32,247
conceal himself in
the hide of the land.

1131
01:21:33,650 --> 01:21:37,669
Then he will return, with
ever greater numbers

1132
01:21:37,754 --> 01:21:42,657
in his following, all believing
that he is the Messiah,

1133
01:21:42,709 --> 01:21:46,994
all willing to be part of a
rebellion that brings him

1134
01:21:47,047 --> 01:21:48,379
to the throne.

1135
01:21:52,435 --> 01:21:54,018
But I remember,

1136
01:21:56,172 --> 01:21:59,474
I remember as
a child, seeing

1137
01:22:02,312 --> 01:22:05,346
...bodies, hundreds of

1138
01:22:05,398 --> 01:22:07,815
...dead Jews,

1139
01:22:07,867 --> 01:22:09,651
killed by the Romans.

1140
01:22:10,870 --> 01:22:12,186
The revolts of Judas

1141
01:22:12,239 --> 01:22:13,454
the Galilean.

1142
01:22:13,523 --> 01:22:16,040
Also hailed
as the Messiah.

1143
01:22:18,528 --> 01:22:19,994
Do you understand my fear?

1144
01:22:22,198 --> 01:22:24,966
The horror that this man
could bring to our people.

1145
01:22:25,835 --> 01:22:28,670
Have you confronted him?

1146
01:22:28,722 --> 01:22:30,755
To no avail.

1147
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:34,041
He seeks confrontation then
turns our words against us,

1148
01:22:34,094 --> 01:22:35,760
he mocks us in our own temple.

1149
01:22:35,845 --> 01:22:38,980
God's word is quite clear.

1150
01:22:39,048 --> 01:22:42,717
Any false prophet who incites
rebellion

1151
01:22:42,769 --> 01:22:46,487
against God's authority should
be put to death.

1152
01:22:46,556 --> 01:22:52,393
You ... are the most
respected voice of that law.

1153
01:22:52,445 --> 01:22:54,996
Will you take his
judgment upon yourself?

1154
01:23:01,571 --> 01:23:05,373
Find a way to put him before me.

1155
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:24,896
May I come in?

1156
01:23:35,959 --> 01:23:37,959
This is Joanna.

1157
01:23:38,027 --> 01:23:43,464
She brings perfumed oils and
asks to anoint your hair.

1158
01:23:43,630 --> 01:23:44,809
Bless you, Joanna.

1159
01:24:03,250 --> 01:24:05,333
You come with a
hidden purpose Joanna.

1160
01:24:09,339 --> 01:24:11,840
I'm the wife of Chuza.

1161
01:24:11,925 --> 01:24:13,792
Chief Steward of the Tetrarch.

1162
01:24:18,432 --> 01:24:22,550
They speak of killing you, the
Tetrarch, those of the Temple.

1163
01:24:22,636 --> 01:24:24,769
And you came
to warn me, why?

1164
01:24:24,838 --> 01:24:27,222
My cousin
was to be stoned.

1165
01:24:27,307 --> 01:24:28,473
She lives because of you.

1166
01:24:36,399 --> 01:24:37,982
Don't go to Jerusalem.

1167
01:24:43,707 --> 01:24:44,989
I must.

1168
01:25:22,162 --> 01:25:24,245
This is a
house of prayer.

1169
01:25:24,331 --> 01:25:25,396
This is my...

1170
01:25:25,448 --> 01:25:27,615
- Get Malchus!
- Not a den of thieves.

1171
01:25:28,902 --> 01:25:30,702
It is God's House.

1172
01:25:30,754 --> 01:25:32,086
Down with the money lenders!

1173
01:25:32,172 --> 01:25:33,288
Down with
the money lenders!

1174
01:25:34,958 --> 01:25:36,341
AAArrgh.

1175
01:25:43,583 --> 01:25:45,550
Behold the
King of the Jews!

1176
01:25:48,254 --> 01:25:49,437
Turn out the guard.

1177
01:25:50,307 --> 01:25:53,424
Oh no
hey, hey, hey, hey.

1178
01:26:04,437 --> 01:26:07,104
Behold
the King of the Jews!

1179
01:26:07,157 --> 01:26:08,940
Behold the King of the Jews.

1180
01:26:08,992 --> 01:26:11,910
My house will be
called the house of prayer.

1181
01:26:11,962 --> 01:26:16,247
You have made it
a den of thieves.

1182
01:26:16,299 --> 01:26:17,832
You'll die for this.

1183
01:26:24,975 --> 01:26:29,844
Nazarene, order them
to stop this blasphemous praise.

1184
01:26:29,930 --> 01:26:31,012
Stop?

1185
01:26:31,097 --> 01:26:33,631
If I stop the stones
themselves would cry out!

1186
01:26:33,683 --> 01:26:35,016
Guards, arrest him!

1187
01:26:35,101 --> 01:26:36,517
Arrest that man.

1188
01:27:03,847 --> 01:27:05,763
Ahhh!!!

1189
01:27:05,832 --> 01:27:07,062
Enough!

1190
01:27:08,935 --> 01:27:10,351
Guards hold your place.

1191
01:27:10,437 --> 01:27:12,687
...hold your place!
...hold your place!

1192
01:27:12,772 --> 01:27:13,855
What I came to do,

1193
01:27:15,842 --> 01:27:17,025
is done.

1194
01:27:31,324 --> 01:27:32,657
Our impotence in dealing

1195
01:27:32,709 --> 01:27:35,293
with this man will bring about
the distain of the Romans.

1196
01:27:35,361 --> 01:27:38,212
He invalidates our authority
both in the temple

1197
01:27:38,298 --> 01:27:39,747
and in Jerusalem.

1198
01:27:39,833 --> 01:27:43,051
If he leaves, and
returns a triumphant leader.

1199
01:27:43,136 --> 01:27:47,705
Pilate may decide to deal
with him instead of us.

1200
01:27:47,757 --> 01:27:50,207
Let's judge him
here, in this room.

1201
01:27:50,260 --> 01:27:52,727
- And stone him to death.
- How?

1202
01:27:52,812 --> 01:27:54,512
The mob makes his
arrest impossible.

1203
01:27:54,564 --> 01:27:56,564
He's surrounded by
hundreds who venerate him.

1204
01:28:00,236 --> 01:28:01,402
I have seen a weakness.

1205
01:28:01,488 --> 01:28:04,405
Mmmm...

1206
01:28:04,491 --> 01:28:06,324
Tell us.

1207
01:28:06,392 --> 01:28:09,494
Betrayal, by one of his own.

1208
01:28:09,562 --> 01:28:12,196
Impossible.
They worship him.

1209
01:28:12,248 --> 01:28:13,531
Perhaps not all.

1210
01:28:17,420 --> 01:28:19,620
Judas Iscariot.

1211
01:28:21,041 --> 01:28:22,840
The tax collector.

1212
01:28:22,909 --> 01:28:25,259
Wasn't
sure you'd remember me,

1213
01:28:25,345 --> 01:28:27,845
going as you go,
seeing many faces.

1214
01:28:27,914 --> 01:28:29,464
Few horses like this.

1215
01:28:29,549 --> 01:28:32,083
Yes to be admired he is.

1216
01:28:32,135 --> 01:28:35,019
You should have a fine horse, be
finely mounted as befits

1217
01:28:35,088 --> 01:28:37,438
those who serve a king.

1218
01:28:37,524 --> 01:28:39,057
You were at the temple.

1219
01:28:39,109 --> 01:28:41,392
In truth, no.

1220
01:28:41,444 --> 01:28:42,777
I long for the
rewards of heaven,

1221
01:28:42,862 --> 01:28:46,064
but I take the coin
and let the credit go,

1222
01:28:46,116 --> 01:28:50,151
and ignore the promises
of kingdoms yet to come.

1223
01:28:50,236 --> 01:28:53,788
And facing what you face,
hearing the sighs of the dying

1224
01:28:53,873 --> 01:28:57,125
on the hill of Golgotha.

1225
01:28:57,210 --> 01:29:02,130
Where I in your place, my every
breath would tighten with fear.

1226
01:29:05,418 --> 01:29:08,302
A horse such
as this, costs what?

1227
01:29:08,388 --> 01:29:11,472
A stallion of his blood he could
be had for 15 pieces of silver.

1228
01:29:12,976 --> 01:29:16,344
But I also know a man who would
offer you 30 pieces of silver.

1229
01:29:18,565 --> 01:29:19,814
In return for what?

1230
01:29:22,635 --> 01:29:25,103
Willingness to choose life
over death.

1231
01:29:28,575 --> 01:29:30,274
Where would
this man be found?

1232
01:29:50,713 --> 01:29:53,131
I need to speak with Malchus.

1233
01:29:53,183 --> 01:29:54,298
Asher sent me.

1234
01:30:23,046 --> 01:30:24,662
I haven't much time.

1235
01:30:26,466 --> 01:30:29,050
When and where
can we find him alone?

1236
01:30:29,135 --> 01:30:31,302
The others are
always at his side.

1237
01:30:31,370 --> 01:30:33,204
The 12.

1238
01:30:33,256 --> 01:30:38,709
Or better said, 12 minus one.

1239
01:30:38,761 --> 01:30:42,180
Tonight, we will eat the
Passover meal here in Jerusalem.

1240
01:30:42,232 --> 01:30:43,347
Where?

1241
01:30:43,399 --> 01:30:45,349
I don't yet know.

1242
01:30:45,401 --> 01:30:47,268
A room.

1243
01:30:47,353 --> 01:30:50,071
It was decided without me.

1244
01:30:50,156 --> 01:30:55,693
So far I hear nothing
worth 30 pieces of silver.

1245
01:30:55,745 --> 01:30:58,412
I'll leave that
meal and come here.

1246
01:31:00,917 --> 01:31:03,417
Doing this,
you save your life.

1247
01:31:04,954 --> 01:31:07,672
Yes.

1248
01:31:07,740 --> 01:31:09,707
That must be why I did this.

1249
01:32:09,053 --> 01:32:10,802
Everywhere
there is talk of you.

1250
01:32:10,888 --> 01:32:15,257
An Inn gave us food and lodging
and would accept no payment.

1251
01:32:15,309 --> 01:32:18,677
My son is hailed for
bringing a message from God.

1252
01:32:20,481 --> 01:32:21,980
And those of Nazareth.

1253
01:32:22,066 --> 01:32:24,099
Believing you
to be the Messiah? Yes.

1254
01:32:25,185 --> 01:32:26,685
Some do.

1255
01:32:26,770 --> 01:32:27,869
And you?

1256
01:32:38,916 --> 01:32:41,816
So great will be my pride,

1257
01:32:41,869 --> 01:32:44,836
when I hear you speak at the
temple.

1258
01:32:44,922 --> 01:32:46,121
I'll not
speak there again.

1259
01:32:48,459 --> 01:32:53,629
But on the road, many
were coming to hear you.

1260
01:32:53,681 --> 01:32:56,632
That's over now.

1261
01:32:56,684 --> 01:33:01,803
I've come all this way
...you'll deny me that?

1262
01:33:01,855 --> 01:33:04,439
The decision isn't mine.

1263
01:33:04,508 --> 01:33:08,644
I can't speak of it with you.

1264
01:33:08,696 --> 01:33:11,947
Mother, I have so
longed for you.

1265
01:33:12,015 --> 01:33:13,649
The pain of absence
has been terrible.

1266
01:33:16,453 --> 01:33:18,987
But now it's too late.

1267
01:33:19,039 --> 01:33:21,823
Too late?

1268
01:33:21,875 --> 01:33:23,659
What do you mean?

1269
01:33:23,711 --> 01:33:25,577
James, take
her to Nazareth.

1270
01:33:25,663 --> 01:33:27,162
Have you lost
your mind saying this?

1271
01:33:27,214 --> 01:33:29,998
I beg you spare
her from what must come.

1272
01:33:30,050 --> 01:33:31,673
Where are you going?

1273
01:33:33,770 --> 01:33:35,092
Jesus?

1274
01:33:37,207 --> 01:33:38,974
Come, we must go....

1275
01:34:02,333 --> 01:34:04,566
You wash our feet why?

1276
01:34:04,618 --> 01:34:09,338
Call me Lord,
and place me above you.

1277
01:34:09,406 --> 01:34:11,906
I wash your feet to show that
no master is greater

1278
01:34:11,959 --> 01:34:13,208
than his servant.

1279
01:34:15,078 --> 01:34:18,380
And no messenger is greater
than the one who sends him.

1280
01:34:18,432 --> 01:34:21,350
Come and eat what God has
blessed on this Passover night.

1281
01:34:22,469 --> 01:34:24,936
God bless us.

1282
01:34:25,022 --> 01:34:28,640
Start carving
Matthew, carve it.

1283
01:34:41,071 --> 01:34:43,038
Brothers, Let us talk of what is
written

1284
01:34:43,106 --> 01:34:44,656
and what prophets have said.

1285
01:34:45,909 --> 01:34:48,443
It's in the scripture.

1286
01:34:48,495 --> 01:34:51,246
He who shares my bread, has
lifted his heel against me.

1287
01:34:56,003 --> 01:34:58,503
I tell you now, before it
happens, so when it does happen,

1288
01:34:58,589 --> 01:35:00,555
you know that I'm he.

1289
01:35:00,624 --> 01:35:01,723
No one questions that.

1290
01:35:01,792 --> 01:35:04,459
Many will.

1291
01:35:04,511 --> 01:35:05,560
And one will betray me.

1292
01:35:07,731 --> 01:35:09,264
How can you say this?

1293
01:35:09,316 --> 01:35:10,482
I have been loyal.

1294
01:35:10,567 --> 01:35:11,767
We've all been loyal.

1295
01:35:11,819 --> 01:35:13,101
He's testing us again.

1296
01:35:13,153 --> 01:35:16,104
Brothers, I'll be with
you only a little longer.

1297
01:35:19,743 --> 01:35:21,076
Take what I've said,

1298
01:35:21,144 --> 01:35:25,113
that in me you'll have peace
in a world of anger and despair.

1299
01:35:25,165 --> 01:35:28,917
Take courage for I have overcome
the world, but where I now go,

1300
01:35:28,985 --> 01:35:31,228
- you cannot follow.
- I'll follow.

1301
01:35:31,922 --> 01:35:33,839
I'd lay down my life.

1302
01:35:33,924 --> 01:35:35,874
Go to prison. To death.

1303
01:35:35,959 --> 01:35:38,210
Peter this very night
before the cock has crowed,

1304
01:35:38,295 --> 01:35:40,879
you will deny three
times that you know me.

1305
01:35:40,964 --> 01:35:42,073
I tell you now.

1306
01:35:45,886 --> 01:35:46,968
Where is Judas?

1307
01:35:55,145 --> 01:35:56,862
The Garden of Gethsemane.

1308
01:35:58,031 --> 01:35:59,614
They will go there to pray.

1309
01:36:00,317 --> 01:36:02,984
It's dark
in that garden.

1310
01:36:03,036 --> 01:36:06,238
How will my men
know which is him?

1311
01:36:06,323 --> 01:36:07,656
I will greet
him with a kiss.

1312
01:36:12,496 --> 01:36:13,662
Later.

1313
01:36:30,380 --> 01:36:32,764
Oh my darling.

1314
01:36:32,850 --> 01:36:35,400
Not another dream
of the Baptist.

1315
01:36:35,486 --> 01:36:37,185
I can't sleep.

1316
01:36:37,237 --> 01:36:42,157
Oh the rest I so desperately
need, and then I awaken,

1317
01:36:42,225 --> 01:36:44,109
there that thing is beside me.

1318
01:36:44,194 --> 01:36:45,911
No. No it is gone.

1319
01:36:45,996 --> 01:36:47,195
These are dreams.

1320
01:36:47,247 --> 01:36:49,030
One of the servants
told me it wasn't found.

1321
01:36:49,082 --> 01:36:50,532
It wasn't buried.

1322
01:36:50,584 --> 01:36:51,867
The head!

1323
01:36:51,919 --> 01:36:55,587
No. It was eaten by
jackals in the desert.

1324
01:36:55,672 --> 01:36:58,039
His follower
brings this horror.

1325
01:36:58,091 --> 01:37:00,241
Jesus, takes revenge.

1326
01:37:00,294 --> 01:37:02,460
Tell her the sorcery
of the Nazarene

1327
01:37:02,546 --> 01:37:05,347
will have an end.

1328
01:37:05,415 --> 01:37:07,516
You tell
me he will die too.

1329
01:37:25,152 --> 01:37:29,270
Father take
this cup from me.

1330
01:37:29,323 --> 01:37:31,239
This bitter cup.

1331
01:37:32,459 --> 01:37:35,210
If it's not possible that
this cup be taken away...

1332
01:37:39,950 --> 01:37:41,249
Your will be done.

1333
01:38:18,321 --> 01:38:19,838
So I'm betrayed with a kiss.

1334
01:38:22,726 --> 01:38:23,792
Take me.

1335
01:38:23,844 --> 01:38:24,843
Let them go.

1336
01:38:24,928 --> 01:38:26,011
You don't
give orders to me.

1337
01:38:26,096 --> 01:38:27,178
Agh!

1338
01:38:27,264 --> 01:38:28,680
Agh!

1339
01:38:28,765 --> 01:38:30,515
Agh!

1340
01:38:30,601 --> 01:38:31,800
Leave him.

1341
01:38:31,852 --> 01:38:33,334
Grab the mad man.

1342
01:38:33,387 --> 01:38:34,769
Bind his hands.

1343
01:38:34,838 --> 01:38:36,054
Save yourselves.

1344
01:38:36,139 --> 01:38:37,105
For me.

1345
01:38:37,173 --> 01:38:39,641
You must live.

1346
01:38:39,693 --> 01:38:40,775
Go!

1347
01:39:16,146 --> 01:39:17,762
I'm going to Jerusalem.

1348
01:39:17,848 --> 01:39:19,014
No my brother.

1349
01:39:19,066 --> 01:39:20,882
They'll find you.
They'll kill you.

1350
01:39:20,934 --> 01:39:21,999
I'm going.

1351
01:39:50,703 --> 01:39:52,503
It's cold
and the hour is late.

1352
01:39:52,571 --> 01:39:54,505
And the matter urgent.

1353
01:39:54,573 --> 01:39:55,923
The matter being?

1354
01:39:56,008 --> 01:39:59,844
We've been told the temple guards
have arrested Jesus of Nazareth.

1355
01:39:59,912 --> 01:40:01,212
An
issue of your faith.

1356
01:40:01,264 --> 01:40:04,632
An issue of law.

1357
01:40:04,717 --> 01:40:06,717
Law
beyond my provenance.

1358
01:40:06,769 --> 01:40:10,721
Both our
laws and yours violated.

1359
01:40:10,773 --> 01:40:12,773
He's been taken to
the house of Caiaphas,

1360
01:40:12,859 --> 01:40:15,776
not to the temple and the
chamber of hewn stone.

1361
01:40:15,862 --> 01:40:18,112
His trial will be unjust.

1362
01:40:18,197 --> 01:40:20,364
Sometimes
things are done for expediency.

1363
01:40:20,432 --> 01:40:22,483
Cicero
writing about your Roman law,

1364
01:40:22,568 --> 01:40:26,287
claims where there is immorality
there can be no expediency.

1365
01:40:26,372 --> 01:40:27,488
This is immoral.

1366
01:40:27,573 --> 01:40:28,873
Send troops.

1367
01:40:28,941 --> 01:40:30,291
Free him.

1368
01:40:30,376 --> 01:40:32,276
Roman troops
to the home of a High Priest.

1369
01:40:32,328 --> 01:40:34,211
Are you insane?

1370
01:40:34,280 --> 01:40:40,251
Governor, I ask as a
devout Jew do not allow

1371
01:40:40,303 --> 01:40:42,136
this man to be murdered.

1372
01:40:43,422 --> 01:40:45,556
If he is stoned
it is beyond my purview.

1373
01:40:45,624 --> 01:40:46,690
They want him crucified.

1374
01:40:49,262 --> 01:40:51,262
A punishment
only I can pronounce.

1375
01:40:54,934 --> 01:40:55,983
Ah..

1376
01:40:57,436 --> 01:41:00,187
Will you?

1377
01:41:02,241 --> 01:41:03,524
It's late and I am cold.

1378
01:41:14,787 --> 01:41:16,820
You are accused of acts

1379
01:41:16,873 --> 01:41:18,005
of sorcery.

1380
01:41:18,090 --> 01:41:20,157
Spreading lies.

1381
01:41:20,209 --> 01:41:22,042
Corrupting others.

1382
01:41:22,128 --> 01:41:25,963
I spoke openly in
synagogues, the temple.

1383
01:41:26,015 --> 01:41:28,165
Places where Jews
came to hear of God.

1384
01:41:28,217 --> 01:41:31,135
They came to hear of God.

1385
01:41:31,187 --> 01:41:33,137
The words you gave
them came from Satan.

1386
01:41:36,893 --> 01:41:39,610
Why not ask
those who have heard me?

1387
01:41:39,678 --> 01:41:41,645
They know what I said.

1388
01:41:41,697 --> 01:41:42,696
Agh!

1389
01:41:45,818 --> 01:41:47,701
This is the way
you answer the High Priest?

1390
01:41:51,374 --> 01:41:51,989
Aghh!

1391
01:41:52,041 --> 01:41:53,107
Aghh!

1392
01:41:56,462 --> 01:41:57,461
I command you!

1393
01:41:57,529 --> 01:41:58,662
Let us through.

1394
01:41:58,714 --> 01:42:00,047
Let us through.

1395
01:42:00,132 --> 01:42:01,165
Please! Make way!

1396
01:42:03,336 --> 01:42:04,752
Open this!

1397
01:42:04,837 --> 01:42:09,873
You truly claim you
are the son of the blessed one?

1398
01:42:18,684 --> 01:42:20,017
I am.

1399
01:42:23,990 --> 01:42:27,524
You have heard
blasphemy from his lips.

1400
01:42:27,576 --> 01:42:30,244
These words and more.

1401
01:42:30,329 --> 01:42:32,363
His claim he's a prophet.

1402
01:42:34,583 --> 01:42:35,783
Blindfold him.

1403
01:42:43,342 --> 01:42:45,926
Give us a prophecy,
oh Prophet Jesus.

1404
01:42:50,299 --> 01:42:51,966
Who struck that blow?

1405
01:42:52,051 --> 01:42:53,600
Prophets are all seeing.

1406
01:42:53,686 --> 01:42:54,751
Stop!

1407
01:42:55,587 --> 01:42:57,972
Stop this disgrace.

1408
01:42:58,057 --> 01:43:00,557
You dare to interfere.

1409
01:43:00,609 --> 01:43:03,811
Annas,
we are shamed by what we see.

1410
01:43:03,896 --> 01:43:08,699
If this ... this
cabal is to be called a trial

1411
01:43:08,767 --> 01:43:11,485
then I demand that
we are included.

1412
01:43:11,570 --> 01:43:17,374
You are the two, This blasphemer

1413
01:43:17,443 --> 01:43:21,045
will be judged by a majority.

1414
01:43:22,081 --> 01:43:23,163
What's happening?

1415
01:43:23,249 --> 01:43:26,550
Jesus is a criminal,
posing as the Messiah.

1416
01:43:26,618 --> 01:43:28,335
Not a man who
walks on the waters,

1417
01:43:28,421 --> 01:43:30,954
who feeds the multitudes.

1418
01:43:31,007 --> 01:43:32,389
You saw these wonders?

1419
01:43:32,458 --> 01:43:35,292
Ask yourselves would
priests lay hands upon him

1420
01:43:35,344 --> 01:43:37,177
if he were truly the Messiah?

1421
01:43:37,263 --> 01:43:38,962
People are
fooled by sorcery.

1422
01:43:39,015 --> 01:43:42,266
You ... I've seen
you with him before.

1423
01:43:42,318 --> 01:43:44,268
No, I, I, I don't
need this Nazarene.

1424
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:45,469
It's too dangerous
here, we should go.

1425
01:43:45,521 --> 01:43:46,186
No.

1426
01:43:46,272 --> 01:43:47,337
Come on Simon.

1427
01:43:49,475 --> 01:43:51,825
She says you're a follower.

1428
01:43:51,911 --> 01:43:52,976
She's wrong.

1429
01:43:53,029 --> 01:43:54,862
Deny it under oath.

1430
01:43:54,947 --> 01:43:56,530
I deny him, now enough.

1431
01:44:07,927 --> 01:44:09,376
The vote is against you.

1432
01:44:17,770 --> 01:44:19,720
Make way! Make way!

1433
01:45:04,817 --> 01:45:06,934
These goats,
where do you take them?

1434
01:45:07,019 --> 01:45:09,269
To the temple.

1435
01:45:09,355 --> 01:45:10,454
For sacrifice?

1436
01:45:13,109 --> 01:45:17,945
He leads them to death,
he's their betrayer.

1437
01:45:18,030 --> 01:45:19,363
Yeah...

1438
01:45:20,282 --> 01:45:23,534
I want that rope, just the rope.

1439
01:45:25,037 --> 01:45:26,136
I'll pay.

1440
01:45:26,205 --> 01:45:27,271
Here.

1441
01:45:28,907 --> 01:45:31,642
Unless I lead
him the heard will scatter.

1442
01:45:31,710 --> 01:45:35,179
Scatter and be saved.

1443
01:45:35,247 --> 01:45:36,547
I need the rope.

1444
01:45:36,599 --> 01:45:43,353
Here ...buy more
goats, ten times these.

1445
01:45:43,422 --> 01:45:46,356
Ten times ten.

1446
01:45:46,425 --> 01:45:47,891
Or a horse.

1447
01:45:49,595 --> 01:45:53,313
Yes, now you imagine
it, owning a horse.

1448
01:45:56,802 --> 01:45:58,068
I know the feeling.

1449
01:46:39,811 --> 01:46:43,580
Governor,
you'll not open the gate?

1450
01:46:43,649 --> 01:46:45,815
We've brought a
criminal for judgment.

1451
01:46:45,868 --> 01:46:48,318
Take him and
judge him under your law.

1452
01:46:56,579 --> 01:46:57,661
He won't hear the charge.

1453
01:46:57,713 --> 01:46:58,995
Silence I say!

1454
01:46:59,048 --> 01:47:00,714
He should be executed
for speaking

1455
01:47:00,799 --> 01:47:02,933
against the rule of Caesar.

1456
01:47:03,001 --> 01:47:04,935
Claiming he is King of the Jews.

1457
01:47:08,440 --> 01:47:10,440
Are
you King of the Jews?

1458
01:47:11,527 --> 01:47:14,811
My kingdom is
not of this world.

1459
01:47:14,863 --> 01:47:17,147
I hear no
support for your charges.

1460
01:47:17,199 --> 01:47:20,951
His cryptic
speech is but a ploy.

1461
01:47:21,019 --> 01:47:22,819
He is a criminal.

1462
01:47:22,871 --> 01:47:24,488
We have witnesses.

1463
01:47:24,540 --> 01:47:26,039
He
began his crimes in Galilee.

1464
01:47:26,125 --> 01:47:28,575
Galilee?

1465
01:47:28,661 --> 01:47:31,245
Then take him to the
Tetrarch of Galilee.

1466
01:47:31,330 --> 01:47:32,796
He should judge this man.

1467
01:47:48,981 --> 01:47:50,046
There he is again.

1468
01:47:52,067 --> 01:47:53,267
He is one of them.

1469
01:47:54,486 --> 01:47:56,153
I don't know that
man, you're mistaken.

1470
01:47:56,221 --> 01:47:58,155
You're lying.

1471
01:48:05,698 --> 01:48:08,165
All is as he said.

1472
01:48:09,901 --> 01:48:11,752
Where is God's
army of angels?

1473
01:48:20,412 --> 01:48:22,596
What do you hear?

1474
01:48:22,681 --> 01:48:24,748
Caiaphas is
bringing him here.

1475
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:25,966
Hearing Jesus
comes from Galilee,

1476
01:48:26,051 --> 01:48:28,552
Pilate wants his
blood on my hands.

1477
01:48:28,604 --> 01:48:31,488
He wants my name to curse
the lips of every Jew.

1478
01:48:31,557 --> 01:48:33,089
Sillaeus, leave us.

1479
01:48:33,142 --> 01:48:34,174
Go!

1480
01:48:39,264 --> 01:48:41,531
I will deal
no more with holy men.

1481
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:44,401
I'm a stone wall. Herodias.

1482
01:48:44,453 --> 01:48:46,403
I'll not argue.

1483
01:48:46,455 --> 01:48:49,956
Jesus threatens Priests, but
other than a mob hailing him

1484
01:48:50,042 --> 01:48:54,044
King of the Jews, he
is no threat to you.

1485
01:48:54,112 --> 01:48:57,381
His death need not
be upon our house.

1486
01:48:57,449 --> 01:48:59,549
I cannot simply hide.

1487
01:49:02,805 --> 01:49:05,422
Face him.

1488
01:49:05,474 --> 01:49:11,645
Let the mob see who is truly
fit to be King of the Jews.

1489
01:49:36,755 --> 01:49:39,956
I'm told
you work miracles.

1490
01:49:40,008 --> 01:49:41,842
Do something.

1491
01:49:41,927 --> 01:49:44,294
Anything wondrous.

1492
01:49:44,346 --> 01:49:45,929
Make bread fall
from the heavens.

1493
01:49:47,549 --> 01:49:49,383
Feed us a morning meal.

1494
01:49:49,468 --> 01:49:51,501
My preference is
lentils and barley.

1495
01:49:54,973 --> 01:49:56,273
Do something!

1496
01:50:00,863 --> 01:50:02,479
A miracle could save you.

1497
01:50:06,819 --> 01:50:11,705
It is said that Simon
the Magus could fly. Hm?

1498
01:50:13,058 --> 01:50:16,827
But, can Jesus the Nazarene fly?

1499
01:50:16,879 --> 01:50:18,695
Release him!

1500
01:50:18,747 --> 01:50:21,214
Let him be born aloft.

1501
01:50:21,300 --> 01:50:22,532
Go! Shh...

1502
01:50:22,584 --> 01:50:25,034
Oh, oh look, look,
there he, there he goes.

1503
01:50:25,087 --> 01:50:27,053
No. I'm wrong.

1504
01:50:27,139 --> 01:50:28,555
A bird.

1505
01:50:28,640 --> 01:50:29,723
Not Jesus.

1506
01:50:32,644 --> 01:50:36,179
He makes no wonders
but is hailed as King.

1507
01:50:36,231 --> 01:50:38,064
Let him be adorned as a King.

1508
01:50:39,735 --> 01:50:41,601
Come, come.

1509
01:50:47,075 --> 01:50:49,910
The purple robe of royal office.

1510
01:50:51,697 --> 01:50:54,614
No King should go
forth without a staff.

1511
01:51:11,717 --> 01:51:12,749
Patience.

1512
01:51:12,801 --> 01:51:13,683
Patience.

1513
01:51:13,752 --> 01:51:16,019
Nothing has been forgotten.

1514
01:51:23,061 --> 01:51:23,944
Agh!

1515
01:51:24,029 --> 01:51:25,278
Agh.

1516
01:51:25,364 --> 01:51:26,613
Agh.

1517
01:51:34,990 --> 01:51:38,274
I give you a royal
threat to Caesar Tiberius,

1518
01:51:38,327 --> 01:51:41,661
bring him back to the Romans
to be judged for Sedition.

1519
01:51:41,747 --> 01:51:43,330
You cannot dismiss us.

1520
01:51:43,415 --> 01:51:45,081
He expects you to
deal with this.

1521
01:51:45,133 --> 01:51:49,118
Bring him back to
Pilate, I'm done with him.

1522
01:51:55,460 --> 01:51:57,344
Why must you
cater to these Priests?

1523
01:51:57,429 --> 01:51:58,645
The Tetrarch?

1524
01:51:58,730 --> 01:52:01,348
Without them I cannot
easily govern these people.

1525
01:52:01,433 --> 01:52:03,900
Kill him, and you'll
bear the wrath of his following.

1526
01:52:03,969 --> 01:52:05,318
- I
- must do something.

1527
01:52:05,404 --> 01:52:06,769
I cannot simply set him loose.

1528
01:52:12,644 --> 01:52:13,727
GUARDS!

1529
01:52:34,499 --> 01:52:35,599
Scourge him.

1530
01:52:39,938 --> 01:52:41,021
What's happening?

1531
01:52:43,108 --> 01:52:43,974
Let me through!

1532
01:52:44,026 --> 01:52:45,058
Master.

1533
01:53:00,242 --> 01:53:01,524
Agh.

1534
01:53:01,577 --> 01:53:05,028
His cry.

1535
01:53:05,080 --> 01:53:05,712
Agh.

1536
01:53:05,797 --> 01:53:08,798
My baby boy.

1537
01:53:08,867 --> 01:53:12,385
Oh my baby boy. Ahhh!!

1538
01:53:13,922 --> 01:53:15,371
Agh!

1539
01:53:15,424 --> 01:53:16,222
No! No!

1540
01:53:16,308 --> 01:53:17,340
You mustn't.

1541
01:53:17,392 --> 01:53:19,042
Agh!

1542
01:53:19,094 --> 01:53:21,595
Agh. Agh. Agh.

1543
01:53:21,680 --> 01:53:23,229
Agh!

1544
01:53:25,517 --> 01:53:26,816
Agh! Agh... Agh...

1545
01:53:29,321 --> 01:53:30,820
Agh!

1546
01:53:30,889 --> 01:53:32,388
Make the guard stop!

1547
01:53:32,441 --> 01:53:34,157
No!

1548
01:53:34,225 --> 01:53:35,992
Please!

1549
01:53:36,061 --> 01:53:38,495
Agh!

1550
01:53:38,563 --> 01:53:39,996
Agh.!

1551
01:53:40,065 --> 01:53:42,231
Aghhh!!

1552
01:53:42,284 --> 01:53:44,067
Ahhh!!

1553
01:53:44,119 --> 01:53:45,335
Agh!

1554
01:54:02,020 --> 01:54:04,688
Scourging
is punishment enough.

1555
01:54:04,756 --> 01:54:06,473
He may not survive. Many don't.

1556
01:54:06,558 --> 01:54:10,443
End this
threat to order.

1557
01:54:10,529 --> 01:54:11,561
End it.

1558
01:54:12,931 --> 01:54:17,067
Let the death of this one man
prevent the deaths of many.

1559
01:54:43,145 --> 01:54:44,811
- Crucify him..

1560
01:54:44,896 --> 01:54:47,797
No!

1561
01:54:47,849 --> 01:54:50,233
NO!

1562
01:55:03,281 --> 01:55:05,782
Behold Jesus...

1563
01:55:10,255 --> 01:55:14,791
Ohhh.. Ahh!

1564
01:55:21,332 --> 01:55:23,166
Betrayed.

1565
01:55:23,218 --> 01:55:25,001
Humiliated.

1566
01:55:25,053 --> 01:55:29,305
And soon agony beyond
what you can imagine..

1567
01:55:29,357 --> 01:55:30,557
Oh oh.

1568
01:55:30,642 --> 01:55:34,844
Is this the glory
of God you bragged of?

1569
01:55:34,896 --> 01:55:35,945
Glory.

1570
01:55:38,900 --> 01:55:40,283
As I expected.

1571
01:55:40,351 --> 01:55:41,484
No.

1572
01:55:41,536 --> 01:55:43,570
The temple is God's glory.

1573
01:55:48,827 --> 01:55:50,710
Aaah, God's
glory is love.

1574
01:55:53,749 --> 01:55:58,501
To know love is to know God.

1575
01:56:02,424 --> 01:56:04,540
Give him that...
scort..

1576
01:56:04,593 --> 01:56:06,760
Then Love me.

1577
01:56:06,845 --> 01:56:08,845
Sweet Jesus.

1578
01:56:10,265 --> 01:56:12,398
I do love you.

1579
01:56:12,484 --> 01:56:13,733
I do love you.

1580
01:56:13,819 --> 01:56:15,568
I want to hear
rage from your lips.

1581
01:56:15,654 --> 01:56:18,438
Hear it as you hang
nailed to the wood.

1582
01:56:18,523 --> 01:56:21,608
You will vomit forth a ... a
hatred that will put a lie

1583
01:56:21,693 --> 01:56:22,909
to your words.

1584
01:56:24,529 --> 01:56:25,561
Why are you afraid?

1585
01:56:30,502 --> 01:56:34,170
Here is
a false prophet.

1586
01:56:34,239 --> 01:56:36,589
A false king.

1587
01:56:36,675 --> 01:56:37,707
Mock him.

1588
01:56:37,759 --> 01:56:39,425
For his lies.

1589
01:56:39,511 --> 01:56:43,379
Come ... take joy
at his suffering.

1590
01:56:43,431 --> 01:56:47,250
Oh ... great king.

1591
01:56:47,302 --> 01:56:49,519
Great prophet.

1592
01:56:49,587 --> 01:56:51,754
Mock him.

1593
01:56:51,807 --> 01:56:53,439
Go on!

1594
01:56:53,525 --> 01:56:55,108
Come.

1595
01:56:55,193 --> 01:56:56,392
Move!

1596
01:56:56,444 --> 01:56:57,143
Agh!

1597
01:56:57,229 --> 01:56:58,394
Move!

1598
01:57:01,066 --> 01:57:04,033
Honor the
King of the Jews!

1599
01:57:15,797 --> 01:57:21,050
No! No! No!

1600
01:57:39,521 --> 01:57:41,321
Agh!

1601
01:57:41,406 --> 01:57:42,805
Agh.

1602
01:57:42,858 --> 01:57:44,774
Agh.

1603
01:57:44,826 --> 01:57:47,944
Agh.

1604
01:57:47,996 --> 01:57:50,413
Agh!

1605
01:57:50,481 --> 01:57:53,149
Agh. Agh.

1606
01:57:53,201 --> 01:57:55,585
Agh! Agh.

1607
01:57:55,653 --> 01:57:57,820
Agh. Agh. Agh. Agh.

1608
01:57:57,873 --> 01:58:02,542
Forgive them ... they
know not what they do.

1609
01:58:04,996 --> 01:58:07,680
Agh.

1610
01:58:07,766 --> 01:58:09,716
Agh.

1611
01:58:09,801 --> 01:58:12,668
Agh.

1612
01:58:12,721 --> 01:58:16,055
Agh!! Agh!!

1613
01:58:25,984 --> 01:58:27,683
He spoke.

1614
01:58:27,736 --> 01:58:28,785
He cursed you.

1615
01:58:28,853 --> 01:58:29,903
No.

1616
01:58:29,988 --> 01:58:31,487
He asked his God to forgive us.

1617
01:58:47,038 --> 01:58:53,810
Of all his followers,
only you ... of all of them,

1618
01:58:53,878 --> 01:58:57,313
only you?

1619
01:58:57,382 --> 01:59:01,217
Peter claims he can
see no more of his pain.

1620
01:59:01,269 --> 01:59:03,403
The others fear for their lives.

1621
01:59:21,840 --> 01:59:23,172
Agh.

1622
01:59:23,241 --> 01:59:26,676
Agh.

1623
01:59:26,744 --> 01:59:28,628
Why have you forsaken me?

1624
01:59:32,717 --> 01:59:37,387
If his father has forsaken
him, we are all forsaken.

1625
02:00:28,380 --> 02:00:33,851
Aghhh!

1626
02:00:50,402 --> 02:00:51,869
It is finished.

1627
02:01:00,129 --> 02:01:03,931
Gasp. Aaaaah.

1628
02:01:14,694 --> 02:01:15,792
He said it's finished.

1629
02:01:49,366 --> 02:01:50,748
My son...

1630
02:02:11,470 --> 02:02:14,104
I am Nicodemus.

1631
02:02:14,189 --> 02:02:19,976
And this is Joseph of Arimathea.

1632
02:02:20,062 --> 02:02:25,115
We offer a shroud, and
we have a tomb for Jesus.

1633
02:03:38,390 --> 02:03:41,008
I thought this would end
as you said it would end.

1634
02:03:41,076 --> 02:03:42,058
It is ended.

1635
02:03:42,144 --> 02:03:43,894
All I ask is for
assurance of that.

1636
02:03:43,979 --> 02:03:45,112
Certainty that...

1637
02:03:45,180 --> 02:03:46,279
What that
he will not reappear?

1638
02:03:46,348 --> 02:03:47,731
Of course not.
All I ask...

1639
02:03:47,816 --> 02:03:50,016
Enough.

1640
02:03:50,068 --> 02:03:51,284
Enough.

1641
02:03:57,075 --> 02:03:59,459
Do not tell me that
Priest delays our journey.

1642
02:03:59,528 --> 02:04:02,712
We'll be on the
road to Caesarea as planned.

1643
02:04:02,798 --> 02:04:04,381
What brought him here?

1644
02:04:04,466 --> 02:04:05,832
Fear.

1645
02:04:05,884 --> 02:04:07,551
The man is dead.

1646
02:04:07,636 --> 02:04:10,003
What more could he want?

1647
02:04:10,055 --> 02:04:13,640
He wants the
tomb guarded by Roman soldiers.

1648
02:04:13,708 --> 02:04:16,476
He, of all people,
worries the Nazarene

1649
02:04:16,545 --> 02:04:17,978
will return from the dead.

1650
02:04:18,046 --> 02:04:19,596
He claims
concern that the followers

1651
02:04:19,682 --> 02:04:22,600
of Jesus will take the body in
order to make it appear

1652
02:04:22,684 --> 02:04:25,218
that he has risen.

1653
02:04:25,270 --> 02:04:26,903
Which do you believe?

1654
02:04:26,989 --> 02:04:28,188
I believe
that guarding that tomb

1655
02:04:28,240 --> 02:04:30,023
is a waste of Roman
soldiers' efforts.

1656
02:04:34,696 --> 02:04:36,196
Let's begin our journey.

1657
02:05:50,305 --> 02:05:55,942
Breathy Laugh

1658
02:06:18,433 --> 02:06:19,599
Mmmm!

1659
02:07:32,457 --> 02:07:33,456
Yes.

1660
02:07:33,542 --> 02:07:35,508
I am Simon.

1661
02:07:35,577 --> 02:07:38,962
Called by you, Peter,
the rock of your faith.

1662
02:07:39,047 --> 02:07:41,548
And I will be your
fisher of men.

1663
02:07:46,304 --> 02:07:48,688
He has come!

1664
02:07:48,757 --> 02:07:50,357
Come back to us!

1665
02:07:57,098 --> 02:07:58,565
Yes....

1666
02:08:06,208 --> 02:08:08,491
According
to early Christian tradition,

1667
02:08:08,577 --> 02:08:11,411
Simon took the mission
of Jesus to Rome

1668
02:08:11,480 --> 02:08:14,214
where he formalised the nascent
Christian church.

1669
02:08:15,851 --> 02:08:18,985
The Romans sentenced
him to death

1670
02:08:19,054 --> 02:08:22,589
it is claimed he asked to be
crucified upside down

1671
02:08:22,641 --> 02:08:26,125
so that his death would not
be the equal of Jesus.

1672
02:08:26,961 --> 02:08:31,765
The Romans granted his wish
early writings speak of James

1673
02:08:31,817 --> 02:08:35,502
preaching of Jesus in the
Jerusalem Temple

1674
02:08:35,570 --> 02:08:37,670
it's said he was stoned
to death.

1675
02:08:38,407 --> 02:08:43,193
Supposedly for challenging the
Temple's high priests

1676
02:08:43,278 --> 02:08:46,613
the fates of other disciples are
consigned to legend

1677
02:08:46,665 --> 02:08:48,615
and apocryphal texts.

1678
02:08:48,667 --> 02:08:50,950
Andrew was crucified in Greece

1679
02:08:52,153 --> 02:08:54,587
Thomas was speared
to death in India

1680
02:08:55,624 --> 02:08:57,891
Simon sawed in half in persia.

1681
02:08:58,827 --> 02:09:01,044
Matthew murdered in Ethiopia.

1682
02:09:03,632 --> 02:09:08,301
According to tradition, John was
not martyred but spent time

1683
02:09:08,353 --> 02:09:12,388
in exile on Patmos and
lived to ninety.

1684
02:09:13,809 --> 02:09:17,527
Scholars debate the authorship
of the Gospel of John,

1685
02:09:18,363 --> 02:09:21,281
held by some to be an eye
witness account

1686
02:09:21,349 --> 02:09:22,782
of the life of Jesus.

1687
02:09:25,704 --> 02:09:28,788
Antipas continued pressing Rome
to be named king

1688
02:09:28,857 --> 02:09:31,491
until his efforts offended
the new emperor,

1689
02:09:31,543 --> 02:09:36,963
caligula antipas and herodia
were exiled to Gaul,

1690
02:09:37,031 --> 02:09:38,832
where they died in obscurity.

1691
02:09:40,919 --> 02:09:45,672
Pontius Pilate was recalled to
Rome, while Joseph Caiaphas,

1692
02:09:45,724 --> 02:09:50,810
without his Roman Ally, lost
his position within the temple

1693
02:09:50,879 --> 02:09:55,899
whereas the story of Jesus, a
humble Carpenter of Nazareth,

1694
02:09:55,984 --> 02:09:59,068
gave birth to one of the
world's foremost religions.

1695
02:10:03,325 --> 02:10:09,195
Today there are more than two
billion christians worldwide.

1696
