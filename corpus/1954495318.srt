1
00:00:15,448 --> 00:00:17,517
Timing, timing.

2
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:22,587
Excuse me.

3
00:00:22,588 --> 00:00:24,289
Hey, guys.

4
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,124
You gotta be kidding me.

5
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:27,560
- Fellas.
- Frank.

6
00:00:28,594 --> 00:00:30,495
You must have grown some balls

7
00:00:30,496 --> 00:00:33,098
or you're just fuckin'
plain stupid coming here, son.

8
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:36,401
Just let me talk to him
for just... just for a second.

9
00:00:36,402 --> 00:00:38,169
Please.

10
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:40,740
All right, Jack.

11
00:00:42,241 --> 00:00:44,610
But you've just signed
your own death warrant.

12
00:00:45,811 --> 00:00:48,746
You... you don't look
like you came here

13
00:00:48,747 --> 00:00:51,116
<i>to pay me my money.</i>

14
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:54,586
What?
You want my advice? Huh?

15
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:59,225
I was... I was kind of hoping
you could help me out.

16
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:05,530
You know, Jack,

17
00:01:05,531 --> 00:01:07,198
believe me,

18
00:01:07,199 --> 00:01:10,702
this is not the kind of road
you should go down.

19
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:12,904
You're a fuckin'
card player, Jack,

20
00:01:12,905 --> 00:01:16,442
<i>and not even a good one.</i>

21
00:01:28,454 --> 00:01:30,156
Are you my friend?

22
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:33,493

How's that Viagra
working out for you?

53
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:54,459
Hey, Jack.
What are you playing?

54
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,928
I don't know yet.

55
00:04:57,529 --> 00:04:59,465
What are they playing
over there?

56
00:05:02,401 --> 00:05:05,903
<i>That is so out of your zip code.</i>

57
00:05:05,904 --> 00:05:08,326
<i>Come on, Jack. You know
you don't belong there.</i>

58
00:05:11,043 --> 00:05:12,910
What's the buy-in?

59
00:05:12,911 --> 00:05:14,512
204 on a no-limit hold 'em.

60
00:05:14,513 --> 00:05:16,647
Buy starts at 40,000.

61
00:05:16,648 --> 00:05:18,916
Good, I'll take my usual.

62
00:05:18,917 --> 00:05:20,585
Good luck.

63
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:22,755
Come on, I don't need luck.
You know that.

64
00:05:30,929 --> 00:05:33,064
Usual Jack and coke?

65
00:05:33,065 --> 00:05:35,400
Oh, sweetheart,
do you even need to ask?

66
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:38,736
- The name's Stacey.
- Right, Stacey.

67
00:05:38,737 --> 00:05:41,606
All right, well, you... you should get
a name tag or something, sweetheart.

68
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:43,741
I have a name tag.

69
00:05:43,742 --> 00:05:46,611
Sorry.

70
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:48,348
Thanks, man.

71
00:06:05,564 --> 00:06:08,733
I raise.

72
00:06:08,734 --> 00:06:12,603
<i>Six vodkas. All right,
bring 'em right over.</i>

73
00:06:12,604 --> 00:06:14,472
Ooh. Ooh.

74
00:06:14,473 --> 00:06:16,474
Ms. love, Ms. love.

75
00:06:16,475 --> 00:06:20,578
You know
I got thrown in jail last night?

76
00:06:20,579 --> 00:06:22,580
I'm not surprised.

77
00:06:22,581 --> 00:06:24,015
<i>What happened?</i>

78
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:26,517
Never mind. Listen,
I was in there a while,

79
00:06:26,518 --> 00:06:28,085
<i>and I was pretty hungry.</i>

80
00:06:28,086 --> 00:06:31,088
When dinner came,
it was roasted duck,

81
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:34,525
and... no. No, it was a
bologna sandwich and chips.

82
00:06:34,526 --> 00:06:39,130
No pickles, no lettuce, and
no poker chips... just chips.

83
00:06:39,131 --> 00:06:41,833
Plain. I get to my top bunk,
I'm read to eat dinner,

84
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:44,001
and this giant
black hand comes up,

85
00:06:44,002 --> 00:06:45,636
<i>takes my sandwich.</i>

86
00:06:45,637 --> 00:06:48,139
<i>So I said,
"hey, bro, what's up?"</i>

87
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:51,809
He said, "I'm eating your sandwich.
That's what's up."

88
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:53,644
So I said, "what are you
in here for?"

89
00:06:53,645 --> 00:06:56,593
He goes, "attempted murder."
I said, "you want my chips?"

90
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:01,085
<i>"You can have 'em, man.
I'm not even hungry anymore."</i>

91
00:07:01,086 --> 00:07:03,154
- No doubt.
- "Just please don't beat me to death."

92
00:07:03,155 --> 00:07:05,723
I call. I got the gutter
ball, sweetheart.

93
00:07:05,724 --> 00:07:08,926
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

94
00:07:08,927 --> 00:07:12,631
- You want my chips?
- Fuck you.

95
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:56,307
Thanks.

96
00:07:56,308 --> 00:07:58,943
You never showed up.

97
00:07:58,944 --> 00:08:00,645
Didn't want to show up.

98
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:03,180
<i>I saw you
checking out the big boys.</i>

99
00:08:03,181 --> 00:08:04,949
I was waiting for you.

100
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,652
Got to know when to hold 'em,
know when to fold 'em.

101
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,687
That's what Kenny Rogers says.

102
00:08:09,688 --> 00:08:10,788
<i>Do you?</i>

103
00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:12,189
Do I what?

104
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:14,692
Know when to fold 'em,
when to walk away,

105
00:08:14,693 --> 00:08:16,627
when to run?

106
00:08:16,628 --> 00:08:19,196
I don't know, man. I'm just
trying to get from point "a"

107
00:08:19,197 --> 00:08:21,732
to point "B" without conflict,
you know what I mean?

108
00:08:21,733 --> 00:08:23,601
If only it were that simple.

109
00:08:23,602 --> 00:08:26,571
You play cards a lot.

110
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:28,706
I play people.

111
00:08:28,707 --> 00:08:32,610
I study 'em, I figure out how I
can use 'em to make some money,

112
00:08:32,611 --> 00:08:35,980
adjust my own behavior
accordingly.

113
00:08:35,981 --> 00:08:37,984
I do the same thing that you do.

114
00:08:39,751 --> 00:08:42,787
Well, I guess we all play each
other to a certain extent.

115
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:45,923
<i>No, not to a certain extent.</i>

116
00:08:45,924 --> 00:08:49,060
We play people for money.

117
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:52,196
That what you're doing
right now?

118
00:08:52,197 --> 00:08:54,265
Huh? Is that
what you're doing right now?

119
00:08:54,266 --> 00:08:56,734
- Playing me for money?
- Maybe.

120
00:08:56,735 --> 00:08:59,103
Well, you're shit out of luck.
I don't have any money.

121
00:08:59,104 --> 00:09:00,738
Well, let me ask you something.

122
00:09:00,739 --> 00:09:03,240
How'd you like
to make some dollars?

123
00:09:03,241 --> 00:09:05,776
Enough dollars to keep you
at the adult table

124
00:09:05,777 --> 00:09:07,780
for a long long time.

125
00:09:09,281 --> 00:09:11,717
Here, my card.

126
00:09:16,154 --> 00:09:18,155
Okay, I'll take your card...

127
00:09:18,156 --> 00:09:21,792
And I will give you my card.

128
00:09:21,793 --> 00:09:24,095
You can call me anytime,

129
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:26,163
day or night.

130
00:09:26,164 --> 00:09:27,800
Okay?

131
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,175
Hold on to it.

132
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,410
And give me a call
if you feel like it.

133
00:09:39,411 --> 00:09:40,745
I'll see around, Jack.

134
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:43,814
Now wait a minute,
how do you know my name?

135
00:09:43,815 --> 00:09:45,683
Everybody knows your name, Jack.

136
00:09:45,684 --> 00:09:48,754
You're the dude that draws
to a gutshot straight...

137
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,922
And wins.

138
00:09:51,923 --> 00:09:54,760
Call me... or not.

139
00:10:05,003 --> 00:10:07,073
"Duffy."

140
00:10:22,387 --> 00:10:23,854
<i>You back again?</i>

141
00:10:23,855 --> 00:10:25,358
Hey, Jack.

142
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:42,373
Hey, Carl, good to see you.

143
00:10:42,374 --> 00:10:44,842
I've got some news
for you, Jack.

144
00:10:44,843 --> 00:10:49,914
Paulie trunks'...
Lost all his patience for you.

145
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:51,850
Well, that's not
really news, is it?

146
00:10:53,485 --> 00:10:56,756
You just give me the rest
of what's left, Jack?

147
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:01,293
Okay. Okay.

148
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:04,428
It's right here.

149
00:11:04,429 --> 00:11:06,866
It's right here.
There you go.

150
00:11:14,372 --> 00:11:17,908
<i>Jack, if we come back
for the extra 10 grand,</i>

151
00:11:17,909 --> 00:11:21,414
I think even you're smart enough
to know what's gonna happen.

152
00:11:23,281 --> 00:11:25,751
I'll leave you there
to think about it.

153
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:49,908
Guys, guys, hey, guys.

154
00:11:53,211 --> 00:11:56,113
I was thinking.

155
00:11:56,114 --> 00:11:58,849
It's strange,

156
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:01,986
<i>but for fuckin'
some dumb reason,</i>

157
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:03,988
<I>I like Jack.</I>

158
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:06,726
And I save him, I save his life.

159
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:09,927
Now to thank me...

160
00:12:09,928 --> 00:12:12,429
you know me, I got your back.

161
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:14,431
Yeah.

162
00:12:14,432 --> 00:12:18,469
Well, I'm over here
trying to get some work done.

163
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,538
You gotta just trust me, man.

164
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:23,207
You know?
It's all about loyalty.

165
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:25,244
Yeah, now you're talking
my language.

166
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:05,516
Hello? <i>Are we
going to get to go</i>

167
00:13:05,517 --> 00:13:06,851
- to princess palace this weekend?
- Honey.

168
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:08,986
- Because I wanna bring...
- honey, give me the phone, okay?

169
00:13:08,987 --> 00:13:10,988
Mom, I want to listen
to what he has to say!

170
00:13:10,989 --> 00:13:13,057
<i>I know, honey. Honey, go...
go wash your face.</i>

171
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:15,953
<i>- I'll give you the phone in a minute, okay?
- Oh, mom!</i>

172
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:21,934
Jack...

173
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:26,604
She's really excited to go to princess
palace with you this weekend.

174
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:28,639
You have to show up
this time, Jack.

175
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,076
<i>I cannot handle watching her be
disappointed like that again.</i>

176
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:33,511
<i>I'm serious. If you say
you're gonna do it,</i>

177
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:36,081
<i>you have to show up
this time, okay?</i>

178
00:14:17,956 --> 00:14:19,558
Morning.

179
00:14:21,326 --> 00:14:23,195
Is that guy coming over again?

180
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:29,099
Probably not.

181
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:29,933
Yes!

182
00:14:29,934 --> 00:14:33,038
He's kinda creepy
and smells bad.

183
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:51,188
<i>Jack Daniel, is it?</i>

184
00:14:51,189 --> 00:14:55,327
Yeah, yeah, I have a cousin named Jim beam.
Isn't that weird?

185
00:14:56,461 --> 00:14:58,062
Sure you do.

186
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,097
Got a nephew named Johnny Walker

187
00:15:00,098 --> 00:15:04,068
and an aunt
named Chevitz with a "T."

188
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,122
- It's not the same.
- It's really cool.

189
00:15:08,106 --> 00:15:09,106
Okay.

190
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:13,444
Mr. Daniel,
it appears we have a problem.

191
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:15,279
Yeah, what's the problem, Kelly?

192
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:19,984
You have an outstanding
amount... past due, actually.

193
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:22,152
No no, I paid that already.

194
00:15:22,153 --> 00:15:25,024
According to our records,
you have not.

195
00:15:27,392 --> 00:15:30,294
Are you sure it's not
a mistake on your end?

196
00:15:30,295 --> 00:15:32,629
Our records
are very meticulous, sir.

197
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,431
I'm sure they are, yeah.

198
00:15:34,432 --> 00:15:36,633
I'm afraid there is
nothing I can do for you

199
00:15:36,634 --> 00:15:38,103
until that amount is paid.

200
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:42,074
Kelly.

201
00:15:43,074 --> 00:15:45,676
Let me ask a question.

202
00:15:45,677 --> 00:15:47,546
Do you like dessert?

203
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,581
Of course.

204
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:52,116
Who doesn't, right?

205
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,451
Well, I know a place
that does this bread pudding,

206
00:15:54,452 --> 00:15:57,254
and they put caramel
all over the top of it,

207
00:15:57,255 --> 00:16:00,157
and they put like,
Cap'n Crunch in there.

208
00:16:00,158 --> 00:16:02,693
And I know it's wild,
but it's delicious.

209
00:16:02,694 --> 00:16:06,463
And I will order that
over and over and over again

210
00:16:06,464 --> 00:16:09,201
till you get full.

211
00:16:12,103 --> 00:16:16,173
If you just make... just
make this loan go through.

212
00:16:16,174 --> 00:16:18,108
I appreciate the offer, sir,

213
00:16:18,109 --> 00:16:19,810
but there's really nothing

214
00:16:19,811 --> 00:16:21,612
I can do until
that amount is paid.

215
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:24,116
I'll shave.

216
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:28,120
I'm signing it.

217
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:31,722
And there he is.
Hey, Chuck.

218
00:16:31,723 --> 00:16:32,823
Hello, sir.

219
00:16:32,824 --> 00:16:35,659
Looks like you owe us
a little money there, Jack.

220
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,161
<i>I can't help you out, man.</i>

221
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,196
Well, it's a tough economy
out there, Chuck.

222
00:16:39,197 --> 00:16:40,764
I gotta ask you to go.

223
00:16:40,765 --> 00:16:42,201
Leave?

224
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:47,204
- Look, I understand where you're coming from, Chuck.
- <i>No, sir, really.</i>

225
00:16:47,205 --> 00:16:48,772
- Kelly and I were talking...
- <i>sir, you really have to leave.</i>

226
00:16:48,773 --> 00:16:50,642
Sir, you really have to leave.

227
00:16:53,711 --> 00:16:55,813
Sir, I don't want
to tell you again.

228
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:58,449
You need to leave.
Really, go!

229
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,117
He's a real charmer.

230
00:17:00,118 --> 00:17:02,221
Do you mind if I borrow a pen?

231
00:17:09,527 --> 00:17:13,764
Do you think we should
take Chuck to dessert with us?

232
00:17:13,765 --> 00:17:16,535
I don't think so either.
Ahem.

233
00:17:37,255 --> 00:17:39,156
God damn it.

234
00:17:39,157 --> 00:17:40,524
Hey, excuse me, bud,

235
00:17:40,525 --> 00:17:43,227
do you mind if I borrow your phone
just a second? This one's busted.

236
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,495
I'm in a hurry, man.

237
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:47,331
Yeah, it's a really important phone call.
Just for one second.

238
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:48,565
I got ice cream here.

239
00:17:48,566 --> 00:17:51,201
Okay, well, I tell you what.
You a smoker?

240
00:17:51,202 --> 00:17:52,703
Yeah.

241
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:55,839
How about a pack of smokes
for the phone, 20 seconds?

242
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,876
Quick one.

243
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:00,511
- All right.
- Oh, you're a gentleman.

244
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:01,812
Thank you, man.

245
00:18:01,813 --> 00:18:03,382
Thanks.

246
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,619
A lighter.
Yeah, hang on a second.

247
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,454
<i>Yeah?</i>

248
00:18:10,455 --> 00:18:12,422
Yeah. Yeah, Duffy,
it's me, Jack.

249
00:18:12,423 --> 00:18:14,191
You can keep it.
I don't want it.

250
00:18:14,192 --> 00:18:15,526
Jack who?

251
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:18,395
<i>Jack, we met
at the casino this morning.</i>

252
00:18:18,396 --> 00:18:22,266
Oh. Oh, yeah,
gutshot Jack.

253
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,835
You mentioned something about
an opportunity earlier.

254
00:18:24,836 --> 00:18:26,472
Opportunity?

255
00:18:28,202 --> 00:18:31,308
I don't remember saying anything
about an opportunity, Jack.

256
00:18:31,309 --> 00:18:33,577
You said if I wanted
to some big dollars

257
00:18:33,578 --> 00:18:36,346
and sit at the adult table,
to call you, remember?

258
00:18:36,347 --> 00:18:37,848
Well, I remember that,

259
00:18:37,849 --> 00:18:41,185
but it's not quite
an opportunity.

260
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:43,187
There's a difference,
you know, son.

261
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:45,389
<i>Okay, there's a difference.
I'm interested.</i>

262
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:46,790
You're interested?

263
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:48,458
Yeah, in making
some big dollars.

264
00:18:48,459 --> 00:18:50,360
That's why
I'm fucking calling you, man.

265
00:18:50,361 --> 00:18:52,429
Well, now you're talking, Jack.

266
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,298
Ice cream.

267
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,333
- <i>You know a joint called déjà-vu?</i>
- Yeah.

268
00:18:56,334 --> 00:18:58,602
All right, gutshot.

320
00:21:35,626 --> 00:21:38,597

a lot of them, too.

322
00:21:42,633 --> 00:21:44,968
Yeah, sure, why not?

323
00:21:44,969 --> 00:21:48,038
You're a nice guy, reasonably
good looking for your age.

324
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:50,941
And you're rich too.

325
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:53,143
That covers an awful lot
of character flaws.

326
00:21:53,144 --> 00:21:55,545
Well, how can you tell I'm rich?

327
00:21:55,546 --> 00:21:59,583
I can just tell.
It's what I do. It's my job.

328
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:02,419
You say you play people,
I say I read them.

329
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,089
Okay.

330
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,792
Read me, son.

331
00:22:08,025 --> 00:22:11,061
You have a manicure
and you're not a woman.

332
00:22:11,062 --> 00:22:13,964
You're tan
and it's not summertime.

333
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:16,566
Your suit certainly didn't come
from men's warehouse.

334
00:22:16,567 --> 00:22:20,470
Chicago-roll timepiece and that
pinky ring's no knock-off.

335
00:22:20,471 --> 00:22:23,940
You're far-sighted. I can tell by the
subtle marks on the bridge of your nose

336
00:22:23,941 --> 00:22:26,042
<i>that you wear reading glasses.</i>

337
00:22:26,043 --> 00:22:29,446
But the one thing that tells me
you've got money the most

338
00:22:29,447 --> 00:22:31,448
is you're comfortable
looking your age,

339
00:22:31,449 --> 00:22:33,650
which is somewhere
approaching 60.

340
00:22:33,651 --> 00:22:36,820
And anyone's that's comfortable
looking your age,

341
00:22:36,821 --> 00:22:39,423
tells me
they got a lot of money.

342

00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:06,082
<i>How did I make my money?</i>

350
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:10,987
I don't know that yet.
I haven't figured it out.

351
00:23:10,988 --> 00:23:14,524
Probably by
fucking everybody else over.

352
00:23:14,525 --> 00:23:17,561
You're wrong on your read.

353
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:20,697
No, no, I think
I'm right as rain.

354
00:23:20,698 --> 00:23:24,000
Well, that's pretty close.

355
00:23:24,001 --> 00:23:25,902
But who doesn't?

356
00:23:25,903 --> 00:23:28,505
Maybe, maybe.

357
00:23:28,506 --> 00:23:33,178
But I am interested in making some of
these big dollars you keep talking about.

358
00:23:34,645 --> 00:23:36,780
Well, I'm thrilled
to hear that, my boy.

open that beer bottle

367
00:24:04,809 --> 00:24:06,745

368
00:24:08,913 --> 00:24:10,680

375
00:24:31,969 --> 00:24:35,005

that same beer bottle

376
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:38,275

377
00:24:38,276 --> 00:24:39,744

I know that one too, bud.

We're going to have to

<i>Yeah, that sounds good.</i>

386
00:25:06,871 --> 00:25:08,972
But I think
I need a drink first.

387
00:25:08,973 --> 00:25:12,642
Kitten, bring me another drink.
Bring one for my boy here too.

388
00:25:12,643 --> 00:25:15,045
Yeah yeah, that's cool.
Let's drink.

you got something for me?
Kit, where are you?

396
00:25:36,634 --> 00:25:38,702
- Boys, boys, boys.
- Yes, another round,

397
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:41,271
all right,
for my compadre and myself.

398
00:25:41,272 --> 00:25:43,273
You know I'd love to,
but it's closing time.

400
00:25:45,876 --> 00:25:48,211
Sweetheart, come on. After
the cash I brought with me?

401
00:25:48,212 --> 00:25:50,847
You don't have to go home,
but you can't stay here.

402
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:54,184
Duffy, I'll be damned, I think
she's kicking you out of here.

403
00:25:54,185 --> 00:25:55,921
I guess she is.

404
00:26:24,048 --> 00:26:26,049
What happened to your nose?

405
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:27,952
I doubled down on 17.

406
00:26:29,987 --> 00:26:31,921
<i>Come on in.</i>

407
00:26:31,922 --> 00:26:33,957
<i>Mi casa, su casa,</i> right?

408
00:26:33,958 --> 00:26:36,826
- Oh, look at him.
- Get out of here, you! Go on!

409
00:26:36,827 --> 00:26:38,695
Hey, don't do that
to the little doggy.

410
00:26:38,696 --> 00:26:41,364
That bitch.
My wife's dog.

411
00:26:41,365 --> 00:26:44,100
And don't you tell me how to
deal with animals, all right?

412
00:26:44,101 --> 00:26:48,271
Yeah, hard love works for dogs

413
00:26:48,272 --> 00:26:50,008
and people.
Come on.

414
00:26:52,076 --> 00:26:55,880
So what's this...

415
00:26:56,747 --> 00:26:59,017
What's this bet you got for me?

416
00:27:00,184 --> 00:27:02,018
You gotta guess.

417
00:27:02,019 --> 00:27:04,054
No.
No, you know what?

418
00:27:04,055 --> 00:27:05,889
I'm... I'm tired
of playing this little game.

419
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:07,891
Why don't you just
tell me what it is?

420
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:10,996
Bullshit.
You thrive on the game.

421
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:16,401
And how did you know my name
at the casino?

422
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:22,772
You wanna know
what the bet is, Jack?

423
00:27:22,773 --> 00:27:24,941
- Yeah, yeah, I want to know...
- Follow me.

424
00:27:24,942 --> 00:27:26,943
...what the fucking bet is.

425
00:27:26,944 --> 00:27:29,113
Well, come with me,
Mr. potty mouth.

426
00:27:37,388 --> 00:27:40,725
What?

427
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:45,196
Oh, yeah.

428
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,934
Shit.

429
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:53,271
Yeah, I could learn
how to live like this.

430
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:03,148
Hi.

431
00:28:05,783 --> 00:28:07,283
<i>Who's that?</i>

432
00:28:07,284 --> 00:28:09,020
A friend.

433
00:28:10,521 --> 00:28:13,790
Well, you got
some hot-ass friends.

434
00:28:13,791 --> 00:28:15,391
She's the bet.

435
00:28:15,392 --> 00:28:17,093
<i>Really, how...
how's that?</i>

436
00:28:17,094 --> 00:28:19,262
I want you to fuck her for me.

437
00:28:19,263 --> 00:28:22,233
I'll fuck her
for me. Shit.

438
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:26,438
I'll give you $10,000 if you do.

439
00:28:30,074 --> 00:28:32,909
Yeah, all right, I'm listening.

440
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:36,312
I'll make it $20,000
if I can watch.

441
00:28:36,313 --> 00:28:38,848
<i>That ain't gonna happen.</i>

442
00:28:38,849 --> 00:28:39,883
Why not?

443
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:41,885
'Cause I said so, that's why.

444
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:44,220
You got a problem
with me watching?

445
00:28:44,221 --> 00:28:45,955
Are you a fag or something?

446
00:28:45,956 --> 00:28:48,324
This is bullshit, man. It's not funny.
I'm out of here.

447
00:28:48,325 --> 00:28:49,959
Nice to meet you man.

448
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,928
Tomorrow's Saturday. You got
nothing to do tomorrow.

449
00:28:51,929 --> 00:28:55,431
Yeah, yeah, I do. I work.
I play cards, remember?

450
00:28:55,432 --> 00:28:59,135
Well, you gonna walk
your way back to civilization?

451
00:28:59,136 --> 00:29:01,237
Is that what you're gonna do?
You're gonna make me walk now?

452
00:29:01,238 --> 00:29:03,306
Well, hell if I'm going
to give you a ride.

453
00:29:03,307 --> 00:29:05,141
- Well, I guess I'm walking.
- Wait a minute.

454
00:29:05,142 --> 00:29:06,576
Don't you at least want to know

455
00:29:06,577 --> 00:29:08,578
what you have to put up?
Your end of the bet?

456
00:29:08,579 --> 00:29:10,079
I ain't putting up shit.

457
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,117
Oh, yeah, you are, Jack.

458
00:29:13,984 --> 00:29:15,920
You're putting up your life.

459
00:31:25,249 --> 00:31:27,285
Hi.

460
00:31:29,987 --> 00:31:31,955
Hi.

461
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:34,257
Those my clothes?

462
00:31:34,258 --> 00:31:37,462
Yes, they're yours.

463
00:31:39,463 --> 00:31:41,900
Thanks a lot.
You didn't have to do that.

464
00:31:43,634 --> 00:31:46,269
You're welcome.

465
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:48,571
Where did captain charming go?

466
00:31:48,572 --> 00:31:50,640
Probably back to sleep.

467
00:31:50,641 --> 00:31:52,075
Would you like me
to get him for you?

468
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:54,278
<i>Oh, yeah, that'd be great.</i>

469
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:03,121
I know why he brought you here.

470
00:32:09,426 --> 00:32:12,528
You should put your clothes on

471
00:32:12,529 --> 00:32:15,133
and get out of here
before he wakes up.

472
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,102
Okay.

473
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:23,107
It was nice to meet you.

474
00:32:24,641 --> 00:32:26,344
Good night, Jack.

475
00:32:27,344 --> 00:32:30,114
Did you dry my underwear too?

476
00:32:32,082 --> 00:32:33,985

<i>So what are you waiting for?</i>

495
00:34:58,295 --> 00:35:01,330

Maybe.

497
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:09,107
Come in.

498
00:35:12,709 --> 00:35:15,278
No, no thanks.

500
00:35:18,315 --> 00:35:19,949

00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:23,187
<i>Is that a nice way of saying
I lost my touch?</i>

502
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,329
No.

503
00:35:32,863 --> 00:35:35,500
Hand me my robe?

504
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:44,442
I'm gonna regret this.

505
00:35:48,612 --> 00:35:50,413
Here.

506
00:35:50,414 --> 00:35:51,716
I'll help you up.

507
00:35:58,755 --> 00:36:03,359
You're evil.

508
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,496
You have no idea.

509
00:36:54,044 --> 00:36:56,712
Looks like you're gonna
win the bet after all.

510
00:36:56,713 --> 00:37:00,983
<i>Always knew you would.
I had you pegged.</i>

511
00:37:00,984 --> 00:37:04,053
- Oh.
- God damn it.

512
00:37:04,054 --> 00:37:06,457
<i>I knew you were in on this shit.</i>

513
00:37:07,424 --> 00:37:09,425
<i>Hey, Jack...</i>

514
00:37:09,426 --> 00:37:11,362
Want to see what
50 grand looks like?

515
00:37:17,434 --> 00:37:20,536
Why don't you fuck her?
Something wrong with your dick?

516
00:37:20,537 --> 00:37:23,572
Come on, Jack,
you're a born opportunist.

517
00:37:23,573 --> 00:37:24,907
Embrace it.

518
00:37:24,908 --> 00:37:27,877
This is not gonna happen.

519
00:37:27,878 --> 00:37:29,912
<i>You're ready to do something
behind my back.</i>

520
00:37:29,913 --> 00:37:32,048
But while I'm standing here,
you won't do me the honor

521
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:34,317
of doing it in front of me
like a man,

522
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:36,018
when there's good money
on the line?

523
00:37:36,019 --> 00:37:37,753
Tell me, Jack,
just what is that?

524
00:37:37,754 --> 00:37:40,323
What is that?

525
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:42,491
<i>Huh?!</i>

526
00:37:42,492 --> 00:37:43,926
Do it!

527
00:37:43,927 --> 00:37:46,430
All right, fuck it.

528
00:37:48,732 --> 00:37:51,434
Yeah?

529
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:53,704
<i>Just pretend I'm not here.</i>

530
00:38:17,828 --> 00:38:20,529
All right, hold on.

531
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:23,399
All right, all right,
hang on, hang on a second.

532
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,135
Hang on a second.
Okay.

533
00:38:26,136 --> 00:38:27,503
Hey, hey!

534
00:38:27,504 --> 00:38:29,071
I'm not doing this
with your creepy ass

535
00:38:29,072 --> 00:38:30,639
standing there
with a hand Cannon.

536
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,776
You just became ugly.
Nice to meet you.

537
00:38:33,777 --> 00:38:37,413
Shoot me, shoot me.
Go ahead.

538
00:38:37,414 --> 00:38:40,583
You want it in the back, huh?
Or do you want a knife?

539
00:38:40,584 --> 00:38:42,853
Wanna go in there
and get a kitchen knife?

540
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:48,859
That's what I thought.

541
00:38:52,896 --> 00:38:54,563
Come here a second.

542
00:38:54,564 --> 00:38:56,832
Hey, Jack, Jack, one more thing.

543
00:38:56,833 --> 00:38:59,403
You remember what I told you
about hard love?

544
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:03,741
How about this?

545
00:39:36,606 --> 00:39:39,742
You want to fuck with me?

546
00:39:39,743 --> 00:39:41,777
<i>Huh?</i>

547
00:39:41,778 --> 00:39:43,981
<i>- Oh my God.
- Get up!</i>

548
00:39:45,615 --> 00:39:46,951
<i>Get up.</i>

549
00:39:49,085 --> 00:39:51,187
Get the fuck up.

550
00:39:51,188 --> 00:39:53,524
Fuckin' play dead with me.

551
00:39:57,727 --> 00:40:00,629
Better not be playing dead.

552
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:03,732
Holy shit.

553
00:40:03,733 --> 00:40:05,734
<i>You're my witness.
You saw what happened here now.</i>

554
00:40:05,735 --> 00:40:07,770
- Jack.
- I was just protecting myself.

555
00:40:07,771 --> 00:40:09,004
- Jack.
- He fucking jumped on me.

556
00:40:09,005 --> 00:40:11,507
Listen to me.
Listen to me!

557
00:40:11,508 --> 00:40:14,612
It's gonna be fine.

558
00:40:17,425 --> 00:40:19,215
All right,
don't touch him anymore.

559
00:40:19,216 --> 00:40:21,250
Stop. Get away.

560
00:40:21,251 --> 00:40:23,986
Don't move him. They need to
find him just as this happened.

561
00:40:23,987 --> 00:40:25,988
Nothing happened.
No one was ever here.

562
00:40:25,989 --> 00:40:27,623
Hey, wait wait.
Put those down.

563
00:40:27,624 --> 00:40:29,558
Slow down, slow down now for a minute.
Let's just think.

564
00:40:29,559 --> 00:40:31,160
No, we need to get him
out of here as soon as possible.

565
00:40:31,161 --> 00:40:33,162
No, we need to call
the fucking police!

566
00:40:33,163 --> 00:40:35,631
Do you have any idea the kind
of people we're dealing with?

567
00:40:35,632 --> 00:40:37,933
- Nuh-uh.
<i>- If we call the police,</i>

568
00:40:37,934 --> 00:40:40,636
we are dead.
Do you understand?

569
00:40:40,637 --> 00:40:42,505
Not really.

570
00:40:42,506 --> 00:40:46,877
Please help me
get him out of here.

571
00:40:48,712 --> 00:40:50,881
<i>All right, let's go.</i>

572
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,488
It's okay.

573
00:40:58,955 --> 00:41:02,658
I really don't feel comfortable
leaving you with all this.

574
00:41:02,659 --> 00:41:04,527
We don't really have a choice.

575
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:06,730
All right.

576
00:41:08,598 --> 00:41:10,900
Oh, honey,
are you going to be sick?

577
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:12,301
Nnnn...

578
00:41:12,302 --> 00:41:14,738
Oh.
Bathroom's on the right.

579
00:41:27,918 --> 00:41:30,653
Are you okay?

580
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:32,523
I'm great.

581
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:39,161
This is probably
not the best time for this,

582
00:41:39,162 --> 00:41:42,164
but I just wanted to thank you.

583
00:41:42,165 --> 00:41:44,668
I was a prisoner
in this house, and...

584
00:41:46,002 --> 00:41:48,950
If you makes you feel any
better, you freed me from that.

585
00:41:50,273 --> 00:41:52,710
Yeah, I feel
a lot better, thanks.

586
00:41:55,612 --> 00:41:58,182
I'm gonna to get you
a glass of water.

587
00:44:02,872 --> 00:44:04,707
How much is it?

588
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:05,941
$45.80.

589
00:44:05,942 --> 00:44:08,177
Here you go, take it.

590
00:44:08,178 --> 00:44:09,778
What's this?

591
00:44:09,779 --> 00:44:11,914
It's your lucky day, pal.

592
00:44:11,915 --> 00:44:14,179
Thanks, man. You sure
you don't want change?

593
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:03,926
<i>She's the bet.</i>

594
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:05,829
You're putting up your life.

595
00:46:13,903 --> 00:46:16,940
<i>I know why he brought you here.</i>

596
00:47:10,627 --> 00:47:13,962
Hey! Can I help you?

597
00:47:13,963 --> 00:47:15,999
Hey man, what's up?

598
00:47:18,968 --> 00:47:20,904
I know you.

599
00:47:22,939 --> 00:47:26,243
You were here, right?

600
00:47:28,177 --> 00:47:30,045
You're a friend of Duffy's.

601
00:47:30,046 --> 00:47:33,982
Yeah. Yeah yeah.
It's been a while.

602
00:47:33,983 --> 00:47:36,218
Yeah, I'm...
I'm saying to myself,

603
00:47:36,219 --> 00:47:37,552
"I"... you know,
"I know this guy.

604
00:47:37,553 --> 00:47:39,554
I've seen him before.
He was here."

605
00:47:39,555 --> 00:47:42,391
You were here.

606
00:47:42,392 --> 00:47:44,159
One of the poker nights, right?

607
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,095
Yeah. Maybe, I...
I don't remember.

608
00:47:47,096 --> 00:47:49,131
Yeah, about a year ago.

609
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:52,100
A lot of faces, but you...
you were there, yeah?

610
00:47:52,101 --> 00:47:53,969
Yeah, I don't know.

611
00:47:53,970 --> 00:47:56,238
You know how Duffy's parties
are, man, they're crazy.

612
00:47:56,239 --> 00:48:00,344
Yeah yeah, unfortunately I do
know how Duffy's parties are.

613
00:48:05,682 --> 00:48:09,051
So, is that your car?

614
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:11,520
- Yeah.
- Piece of shit.

615
00:48:11,521 --> 00:48:13,355
What the fuck?

616
00:48:13,356 --> 00:48:15,958
Hey, watch out now.
That's my girl.

617
00:48:15,959 --> 00:48:19,227
Gets me from point "a"
to point "B," you know?

618
00:48:19,228 --> 00:48:21,298
So did you rob me?

619
00:48:26,035 --> 00:48:28,070
I'm sorry?

620
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:30,140
Did you rob me that night?

621
00:48:31,441 --> 00:48:33,442
You know,
'cause if you robbed me,

622
00:48:33,443 --> 00:48:35,477
I'm not talking to you anymore.

623
00:48:35,478 --> 00:48:39,181
No, as I recall
it was you who robbed me.

624
00:48:39,182 --> 00:48:42,417
Oh no, that wouldn't be me. I'm
usually the sucker at the table.

625
00:48:42,418 --> 00:48:46,456
I'm Lewis, Duffy's brother.

626
00:48:54,364 --> 00:48:56,331
Lewis.

627
00:48:56,332 --> 00:48:59,034
Shit, Lewis. Yeah, man,
I remember you now.

628
00:48:59,035 --> 00:49:01,503
- I'm sorry, Lewis.
- You know my name.

629
00:49:01,504 --> 00:49:05,173
Yeah. Yeah, sometimes I
forget my own name, Lewis.

630
00:49:05,174 --> 00:49:08,143
Oh, hey, yeah,
I know all about that.

631
00:49:08,144 --> 00:49:10,746
So you want to come in
and catch up?

632
00:49:10,747 --> 00:49:13,448
No.

633
00:49:13,449 --> 00:49:15,083
Come on, I got omelets in there.

634
00:49:15,084 --> 00:49:17,452
We got all kinds of fruit,
wines... really good stuff.

635
00:49:17,453 --> 00:49:21,390
No, really I shouldn't. You know,
I was just in the neighborhood,

636
00:49:21,391 --> 00:49:23,058
thought I'd come by and say hi.

637
00:49:23,059 --> 00:49:24,426
You're from out of town?

638
00:49:24,427 --> 00:49:26,496
Yeah, kind of, Lewis.

639
00:49:28,264 --> 00:49:31,099
You want to know
what he was doing in there?

640
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:32,667
Excuse me?

641
00:49:32,668 --> 00:49:35,138
You want to see her?

642
00:49:39,242 --> 00:49:41,078
Come on.

643
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:54,156
Is she a killer or what?

644
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:56,058
I don't know about you,

645
00:49:56,059 --> 00:49:58,260
but I think that's the most
beautiful rear end on an automobile

646
00:49:58,261 --> 00:50:00,197
that I've ever seen.

647
00:50:01,844 --> 00:50:04,266
You should leave.
I'll take care of everything.

648
00:50:04,267 --> 00:50:07,269
I really don't feel comfortable
leaving you here with all this.

649
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:09,538
But you're not impressed.

650
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:12,441
It's nice.
It's awesome, yeah.

651
00:50:12,442 --> 00:50:15,545
Yeah. You get in a
fight or something?

652
00:50:18,347 --> 00:50:21,485
You got fresh scratches
on your neck.

653
00:50:25,855 --> 00:50:28,123
Oh man, no.

654
00:50:28,124 --> 00:50:30,092
I was...

655
00:50:30,093 --> 00:50:31,226
She was an animal, right?

656
00:50:31,227 --> 00:50:32,828
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

657
00:50:32,829 --> 00:50:34,729
Yeah, a real tigress.

658
00:50:34,730 --> 00:50:37,599
- Cougar.
- Cougar. That's what... yeah.

659
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:39,801
Yeah.

660
00:50:39,802 --> 00:50:42,370
You know I...
to tell you the truth,

661
00:50:42,371 --> 00:50:44,506
I don't give
a rat's ass about cars.

662
00:50:44,507 --> 00:50:48,176
You know, as long as it... as it
runs, that's all I care about.

663
00:50:48,177 --> 00:50:52,282
All this is overcompensation
as far as I'm concerned.

664
00:50:58,521 --> 00:51:01,191
Come on, let me
fix you something to eat.

665
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:06,862
There she is!

666
00:51:06,863 --> 00:51:09,297
Where's the puppy?
Where's the poo-poo?

667
00:51:09,298 --> 00:51:12,300
Come here.

668
00:51:12,301 --> 00:51:14,669
Hey, look at that.

669
00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:16,671
Normally she'd be
barking her head off.

670
00:51:16,672 --> 00:51:19,174
She didn't have any time
for anybody but me and Duffy.

671
00:51:19,175 --> 00:51:22,310
Yeah, this is joy.

672
00:51:22,311 --> 00:51:26,348
Yeah. She's a product
of hard love.

673
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:28,455
Remember when I told you
about hard love?

674
00:51:32,355 --> 00:51:34,724
Come on.
I'll fix you a drink.

675
00:51:37,927 --> 00:51:41,765
Did, did Duffy tell you
when he'd be back from his trip?

676
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:50,372
I never knew he left, Lewis.

677
00:51:50,373 --> 00:51:53,208
Me neither.

678
00:51:53,209 --> 00:51:56,379
Great communication, huh?

679
00:51:59,315 --> 00:52:02,918
You know, I... I really shouldn't drink.
I gotta be at work.

680
00:52:02,919 --> 00:52:04,786
I was supposed to be there
right now.

681
00:52:04,787 --> 00:52:06,221
I was just kinda
on my lunch break, you know.

682
00:52:06,222 --> 00:52:07,722
On lunch?

683
00:52:07,723 --> 00:52:09,724
Well here, enjoy the fruit part

684
00:52:09,725 --> 00:52:12,362
of your nutritional pyramid,
my friend.

685
00:52:25,675 --> 00:52:27,677
Sit down.

686
00:52:34,884 --> 00:52:37,354
You're kind of a quiet guy, huh?

687
00:52:39,388 --> 00:52:40,889
No, not really.

688
00:52:40,890 --> 00:52:42,692
What do you say we cut the shit?

689
00:52:43,993 --> 00:52:47,429
You want to know what
the bet is, hot shot?

690
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:49,766
Did Duffy go back to gambling?

691
00:52:51,367 --> 00:52:53,570
I don't know.

692
00:52:55,905 --> 00:52:57,539
Don't lie to me.

693
00:52:57,540 --> 00:52:59,442
Okay.

694
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:05,447
Hey, what do you say?
Hey... hey, sweetheart!

695
00:53:05,448 --> 00:53:07,682
Come on down here. There's an
old friend of duff's here.

696
00:53:07,683 --> 00:53:09,384
<i>I want you to meet him.</i>

697
00:53:09,385 --> 00:53:11,653
Did you ever meet her?
No, you wouldn't have.

698
00:53:11,654 --> 00:53:13,690
She's a recent acquisition.

699
00:53:15,858 --> 00:53:19,529
Hey, we're gonna have a drink by the pool.
Come on, join us.

700
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:23,366
Pool's this way.

701
00:53:26,302 --> 00:53:27,470
Yeah.

702
00:53:36,345 --> 00:53:40,483
So... where did you
and Duffy meet?

703
00:53:43,753 --> 00:53:45,453
Casino.

704
00:53:45,454 --> 00:53:47,055
- Casino.
- Yes.

705
00:53:47,056 --> 00:53:50,109
You know, let's give him a call right now.
What do you say?

706
00:53:50,884 --> 00:53:52,727
<i>How'd you like
to make some dollars?</i>

707
00:53:52,728 --> 00:53:54,763
- Do it!
<i>- Do you have any idea</i>

708
00:53:54,764 --> 00:53:56,931
<i>of the kind of people
we're dealing with?</i>

709
00:53:56,932 --> 00:53:59,567
No. No,
that's not a good idea.

710
00:53:59,568 --> 00:54:02,971
- Yeah, I'm sure he's dying to hear from me.
- <i>No no.</i>

711
00:54:02,972 --> 00:54:04,741
He's probably busy.

712
00:54:06,776 --> 00:54:08,843
Take off that hat.

713
00:54:08,844 --> 00:54:11,448
I feel like
I'm talking to rocky.

714
00:54:16,819 --> 00:54:19,456
Straight to voicemail,
go figure.

715
00:54:25,594 --> 00:54:28,865
So, Jack, refresh my memory.
What is it you do?

716
00:54:33,836 --> 00:54:35,537
That's a good question.

717
00:54:35,538 --> 00:54:37,440
I bet you got a good answer.

718
00:54:44,513 --> 00:54:46,548
How do you know my name, Lewis?

719
00:54:46,549 --> 00:54:48,950
You told me.

720
00:54:48,951 --> 00:54:51,586
Yeah, you did. You told me... you
said, "Jack Daniel, like the drink."

721
00:54:51,587 --> 00:54:53,488
And I said,
"a damn good one at that."

722
00:54:53,489 --> 00:54:56,426
- No, I didn't.
- Yeah, you did.

723
00:54:57,493 --> 00:55:01,531
On poker night, remember?

724
00:55:06,902 --> 00:55:08,538
I think I should go.

725
00:55:09,572 --> 00:55:10,840
Okay.

726
00:55:15,745 --> 00:55:18,014
Thanks for the drink.

727
00:55:19,648 --> 00:55:21,785
Bye bye.

728
00:55:23,753 --> 00:55:26,089
I'll see you around, Jack.

729
00:55:33,429 --> 00:55:36,466
"Out out, brief candle."

730
00:55:37,867 --> 00:55:41,603
Roll down the window.

731
00:55:41,604 --> 00:55:44,606
God damn it.

732
00:55:44,607 --> 00:55:47,509
- Oh my God.
- Sorry.

733
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:49,978
Why did you come here?

734
00:55:49,979 --> 00:55:51,746
The laundromat
by my house was closed.

735
00:55:51,747 --> 00:55:53,615
You left this.

736
00:55:53,616 --> 00:55:54,682
Oh, jeez, there it is.

737
00:55:54,683 --> 00:55:56,818
I took care of it.

738
00:55:56,819 --> 00:55:58,753
Yeah, how?

739
00:55:58,754 --> 00:56:00,789
I went to the desert yesterday
and I buried him.

740
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:01,958
Ooh, that's original.

741
00:56:03,626 --> 00:56:05,593
Lewis knows what happened.

742
00:56:05,594 --> 00:56:07,762
I can feel it, Jack.
He has to disappear.

743
00:56:07,763 --> 00:56:09,097
Slow down there, tiger.

744
00:56:09,098 --> 00:56:10,765
You've been watching
too many gangster movies.

745
00:56:10,766 --> 00:56:12,901
No, I'm serious. I'm talking
about our lives here.

746
00:56:12,902 --> 00:56:16,218
You have no idea... the person
that you were just in there with.

747
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,140
What are you doing?

748
00:56:19,141 --> 00:56:21,543
Jack, listen to me.
I buried him for you, okay?

749
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:22,811
I'm saving your life.

750
00:56:22,812 --> 00:56:26,981
I saved you!
Oh, great, now I owe you?

751
00:56:26,982 --> 00:56:28,650
Shit, I don't even know
you're name.

752
00:56:28,651 --> 00:56:30,885
Listen, Lewis despises me.
He always has, okay?

753
00:56:30,886 --> 00:56:32,487
And he scares me.

754
00:56:32,488 --> 00:56:34,656
If he has any idea
that we have something to do

755
00:56:34,657 --> 00:56:36,057
with the disappearance
of his brother,

756
00:56:36,058 --> 00:56:37,559
there's no telling
what he will do, Jack.

757
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,461
Don't worry about it.

758
00:56:39,462 --> 00:56:41,763
Get out before you get us both killed.
Okay? How about that?

759
00:56:41,764 --> 00:56:43,733
Okay.

760
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:47,836
What is it, locked?

761
00:56:47,837 --> 00:56:50,672
Oh, man.
You are a piece of work.

762
00:56:50,673 --> 00:56:52,707
You haven't seen anything yet.

763
00:56:52,708 --> 00:56:55,678
All right. You couldn't wipe
your ass with both hands.

764
00:56:56,846 --> 00:56:59,582
Fucking... unbelievable.

765
00:57:12,528 --> 00:57:14,731
Beautiful day for a swim.

766
00:57:16,665 --> 00:57:20,670
Careful out there.
There's no lifeguard on duty.

767
01:00:40,836 --> 01:00:43,871
Hey, Zeke, there's a chump
on his way up here.

768
01:00:43,872 --> 01:00:45,940
Give him that card
and let him in, okay?

769
01:00:45,941 --> 01:00:49,045
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

770
01:01:02,324 --> 01:01:04,327
Would you like to come in?

771
01:01:06,228 --> 01:01:08,763
It is the only door up here.

772
01:01:08,764 --> 01:01:10,800
I believe that's for you.

773
01:01:12,034 --> 01:01:14,202
That's not mine.

774
01:01:14,203 --> 01:01:16,806
Oh, yeah, it is.
Look at that.

775
01:01:18,507 --> 01:01:20,710
Come on in, Jack.

776
01:01:22,010 --> 01:01:24,345
Nice.

777
01:01:24,346 --> 01:01:27,782
Not nice enough.

778
01:01:27,783 --> 01:01:30,284
<i>That's bullshit.</i>

779
01:01:30,285 --> 01:01:34,188
<i>Looks like 99% have been
waiting on a spade.</i>

780
01:01:34,189 --> 01:01:36,257
Fuckin' serious?

781
01:01:36,258 --> 01:01:39,260
Oh, yeah. Boy, was I
glad to see that Jack.

782
01:01:39,261 --> 01:01:42,530
Not you, asshole.
The Jack of spades.

783
01:01:42,531 --> 01:01:44,332
<i>Are you serious?</i>

784
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:48,169
Oh, ay! Oh, ay!
Mr. fuckin' balboa.

785
01:01:48,170 --> 01:01:51,139
You're about the worst tail
I've ever seen in my life,

786
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:52,874
you know that?

787
01:01:52,875 --> 01:01:55,109
In that car you might as well
be driving a fucking bus.

788
01:01:55,110 --> 01:01:57,445
Excuse me, gentlemen.

789
01:01:57,446 --> 01:02:01,816
What'd I tell you
about this stupid hat?

790
01:02:01,817 --> 01:02:03,985
I don't know.
I wasn't listening.

791
01:02:03,986 --> 01:02:06,222
I'm just trying
to lighten things up, man.

792
01:02:07,923 --> 01:02:10,158
So what are
we doing here, Lewis?

793
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:13,895
I think the question is
what are you doing here, Jack?

794
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:15,997
Well, I think I know.

795
01:02:15,998 --> 01:02:18,833
You want to know what do and, more
importantly, you want to know what I know.

796
01:02:18,834 --> 01:02:20,401
Is that right?

797
01:02:20,402 --> 01:02:23,192
Well, why don't you just ask me, Jack?
What do I know?

798
01:02:24,173 --> 01:02:25,907
About what happened
to my brother.

799
01:02:25,908 --> 01:02:28,244
I don't know.
You tell me what happened.

800
01:02:30,112 --> 01:02:32,313
If you're trying
to protect her, don't.

801
01:02:32,314 --> 01:02:33,981
I'm not.

802
01:02:33,982 --> 01:02:35,384
Don't bullshit me.

803
01:02:41,256 --> 01:02:42,990
They started fighting.
I left.

804
01:02:42,991 --> 01:02:44,425
I don't know
what happened after that.

805
01:02:44,426 --> 01:02:48,329
Maybe, maybe somebody else
went over there after I left.

806
01:02:48,330 --> 01:02:49,931
You ever think of that?

807
01:02:49,932 --> 01:02:51,999
Somebody went over there
at 5:00 in the fucking morning

808
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,001
after you left?

809
01:02:54,002 --> 01:02:57,104
So you think I had something
to do with it? Okay.

810
01:02:57,105 --> 01:03:00,174
Hang on, hang on. Don't go anywhere.
I wanna show you something.

811
01:03:00,175 --> 01:03:03,878
These things are amazing.
You got one of these yet?

812
01:03:03,879 --> 01:03:05,947
It was a gift from a client.

813
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:08,950
It seems like
I found the black box.

814
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:11,053
You know, the one
from the accident.

815
01:03:13,989 --> 01:03:16,991
Aw, don't look like that, Jack.

816
01:03:16,992 --> 01:03:18,893
I suppose
that it could be argued

817
01:03:18,894 --> 01:03:20,895
in some courts of law
that it was self-defense,

818
01:03:20,896 --> 01:03:24,165
even if you were
fucking the man's wife.

819
01:03:24,166 --> 01:03:26,400
The little damsel in distress.

820
01:03:26,401 --> 01:03:28,502
<i>Well, she can
take care of herself.</i>

821
01:03:28,503 --> 01:03:31,906
Oh yes, she can, absolutely.
She's proven that.

822
01:03:31,907 --> 01:03:34,008
The question is, who's going to
take care of little Stephanie?

823
01:03:34,009 --> 01:03:36,913
<i>That's who I'd be worried
about if I were you, Jack.</i>

824
01:03:39,948 --> 01:03:42,083
I'm sorry.

825
01:03:42,084 --> 01:03:46,153
But I know all about you,
your kid, your wife,

826
01:03:46,154 --> 01:03:47,955
your debts.

827
01:03:47,956 --> 01:03:51,259
That shit's easy. That's just
a couple of phone calls.

828
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:55,263
What exactly is it
that you do, Lewis?

829
01:03:55,264 --> 01:03:57,632
I paint things
between a hard place

830
01:03:57,633 --> 01:03:58,900
and a harder place.

831
01:03:58,901 --> 01:04:00,635
And not to toot my own horn,

832
01:04:00,636 --> 01:04:02,003
but I'm a regular
fucking Picasso

833
01:04:02,004 --> 01:04:04,506
and I'm about
to paint my masterpiece.

834
01:04:06,642 --> 01:04:09,010
<i>- Your hot tea, Lewis.</i>
- Oh, thanks, sweetheart.

835
01:04:09,011 --> 01:04:10,847
You're welcome.

836
01:04:19,562 --> 01:04:22,089
- What do you want?
- All right, here's the deal.

837
01:04:22,090 --> 01:04:24,292
Duff was blood by default.

838
01:04:24,293 --> 01:04:27,295
He was a selfish prick who
wanted everything for himself.

839
01:04:27,296 --> 01:04:29,096
Can you believe that?
My own brother?

840
01:04:29,097 --> 01:04:32,166
<i>You know, actually you
did me a huge favor,</i>

841
01:04:32,167 --> 01:04:35,569
and I'll bet money that you
did her a nice solid too.

842
01:04:35,570 --> 01:04:37,638
Well, that's good.

843
01:04:37,639 --> 01:04:39,507
I did you a favor.
We're even then, right?

844
01:04:39,508 --> 01:04:41,108
No.
No, we're not even.

845
01:04:41,109 --> 01:04:43,177
You're gonna do me
another favor.

846
01:04:43,178 --> 01:04:46,082
Like what?

847
01:04:47,349 --> 01:04:49,952
You're going to kill the bitch.

848
01:04:58,493 --> 01:05:00,461
What if I disappear?

849
01:05:00,462 --> 01:05:04,000
If you can, you should.

850
01:05:05,817 --> 01:05:08,502
But I gotta tell you,
I got better eyes than you do,

851
01:05:08,503 --> 01:05:13,075
I got better ears than you do, and
I got one hell of a loyal staff.

852
01:05:15,577 --> 01:05:19,246
So let me clear up any
lingering doubts you may have.

853
01:05:19,247 --> 01:05:21,248
If you want to live,

854
01:05:21,249 --> 01:05:25,453
if you want those
that you care about to live,

855
01:05:25,454 --> 01:05:27,189
<i>you'll do this.</i>

856
01:05:30,058 --> 01:05:31,427
Think about it.

857
01:05:33,128 --> 01:05:35,131
<i>It's a really good deal.</i>

858
01:05:40,002 --> 01:05:43,005
We'll talk soon.

859
01:05:53,248 --> 01:05:56,117
<i>Don't lie to me.</i>

860
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:58,319
<i>I know all about you.</i>

861
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:00,154
<i>I know about your wife.</i>

862
01:06:00,155 --> 01:06:02,456
<i>I know about your debts.
That shit's easy.</i>

863
01:06:02,457 --> 01:06:05,457
<i>Question is, who's going to
take care of little Stephanie?</i>

864
01:06:07,229 --> 01:06:09,914
<i>That's who I'd be worried
about if I were you, Jack.</i>

865
01:06:10,465 --> 01:06:13,200
<i>I'll be goddamned
if some street-walking whore</i>

866
01:06:13,201 --> 01:06:15,469
<i>is going to walk away
with my father's fortune.</i>

867
01:06:15,470 --> 01:06:18,140
<i>If you're trying
to protect her, don't.</i>

868
01:06:19,241 --> 01:06:21,677
<i>You're going to kill the bitch.</i>

869
01:06:23,045 --> 01:06:24,612
<i>If you want to live,</i>

870
01:06:24,613 --> 01:06:28,115
<i>if you want those
that you care about to live,</i>

871
01:06:28,116 --> 01:06:29,685
<i>you'll do this.</i>

872
01:07:01,283 --> 01:07:02,451
Come on.

873
01:07:07,422 --> 01:07:09,123
What are you doing?

874
01:07:09,124 --> 01:07:10,357
I was letting myself in.

875
01:07:10,358 --> 01:07:11,492
How'd you do that?

876
01:07:11,493 --> 01:07:13,360
It was open.
I was worried about you.

877
01:07:13,361 --> 01:07:16,132
- Are you okay?
- It was open?

878
01:07:17,299 --> 01:07:19,100
Oh fuck.

879
01:07:19,101 --> 01:07:21,404
<i>Wasn't smart.</i>

880
01:07:23,505 --> 01:07:25,141
You know I could've killed you.

881
01:07:31,847 --> 01:07:33,747
What are you gonna do?

882
01:07:33,748 --> 01:07:36,517
What, am I going to kill you?

883
01:07:36,518 --> 01:07:38,254
Should I?

884
01:07:44,226 --> 01:07:46,729
I just came
to see if you were okay.

885
01:07:55,704 --> 01:07:59,408
What have you gotten me into?

886
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:06,515
Huh?

887
01:08:30,605 --> 01:08:32,441
<i>It's may.</i>

888
01:08:33,942 --> 01:08:35,043
My name.

889
01:08:39,247 --> 01:08:41,415
May.

890
01:08:41,416 --> 01:08:44,186
That's a pretty name
for a pretty girl.

891
01:08:46,288 --> 01:08:49,825
So tell me, did you
ever really love Duffy?

892
01:08:52,827 --> 01:08:55,498
Yes, I did...

893
01:08:56,498 --> 01:08:58,167
At first.

894
01:09:02,470 --> 01:09:05,207
He was... charming.

895
01:09:07,642 --> 01:09:09,578
There was something kind
about him.

896
01:09:11,613 --> 01:09:14,215
And what happened?

897
01:09:14,216 --> 01:09:15,784
He changed.

898
01:09:19,321 --> 01:09:21,422
Started watching
everything I did,

899
01:09:21,423 --> 01:09:23,390
everywhere I went.

900
01:09:23,391 --> 01:09:26,662
He said that he made me...

901
01:09:28,563 --> 01:09:30,266
That he owned me.

902
01:09:31,266 --> 01:09:33,469
<i>I was afraid of him.</i>

903
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:39,241
I'm on wife ♪4.

904
01:09:42,081 --> 01:09:44,345
<i>You're ready to do something
behind my back.</i>

905
01:09:44,346 --> 01:09:48,282
Tell me, Jack, just what is that?
What is that?

906
01:09:48,283 --> 01:09:51,178
Somebody went over there at
5:00 in the fucking morning?

907
01:09:53,788 --> 01:09:55,956
Go home, may.

908
01:09:55,957 --> 01:09:58,827
I'm gonna take care of all this.

909
01:10:02,797 --> 01:10:04,366
How?

910
01:10:07,569 --> 01:10:10,372
Just go home.
I'll handle it.

911
01:10:50,345 --> 01:10:53,414
Hey.
Carl around?

912
01:10:53,415 --> 01:10:55,516
Yeah, he's in the back
in the gym.

913
01:10:55,517 --> 01:10:57,418
All right, thank you.

914
01:10:57,419 --> 01:10:58,954
What's up, dude?

915
01:11:08,663 --> 01:11:10,733
Timing, timing.

916
01:11:14,102 --> 01:11:17,371
Excuse me.
Hey, guys.

917
01:11:17,372 --> 01:11:18,939
You gotta be kidding me.

918
01:11:18,940 --> 01:11:21,410
- Fellas.
- Frank.

919
01:11:22,198 --> 01:11:23,777
You must have grown some balls

920
01:11:23,778 --> 01:11:26,515
or you're just plain fucking
stupid coming here, son.

921
01:11:28,350 --> 01:11:29,851
You've come to buy a car?

922
01:11:32,053 --> 01:11:34,556
Well, where's my package?

923
01:11:35,957 --> 01:11:39,063
I don't... I don't have your
money, if that's what you mean.

924
01:11:40,061 --> 01:11:41,195
This guy, man.

925
01:11:41,196 --> 01:11:43,797
So you don't have my money,
you don't want to buy a car.

926
01:11:43,798 --> 01:11:45,483
What the fuck do you want, Jack?

927
01:11:46,634 --> 01:11:48,669
I want to talk to Paulie.

928
01:11:48,670 --> 01:11:50,306
You are talking to Paulie.

929
01:11:51,639 --> 01:11:54,534
Everything that goes through
him has to come through me.

930
01:11:55,443 --> 01:11:58,445
With all due respect, I...

931
01:11:58,446 --> 01:12:01,081
I got to talk to him alone.

932
01:12:01,082 --> 01:12:05,018
All due respect?
All due respect?

933
01:12:05,019 --> 01:12:08,422
I'll give you some advice, Jack.

934
01:12:08,423 --> 01:12:10,457
Get the fuck out of here.

935
01:12:10,458 --> 01:12:12,559
You heard him,
get the fuck out of here.

936
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:14,495
And get my money, Jack.

937
01:12:14,496 --> 01:12:17,431
- Dumb-ass.
- Let's get back to it.

938
01:12:17,432 --> 01:12:20,434
Carl, please, Carl.

939
01:12:20,435 --> 01:12:24,138
Let me talk to him for just...
just for a second.

940
01:12:24,139 --> 01:12:25,873
Please.

941
01:12:25,874 --> 01:12:27,776
All right, Jack.

942
01:12:29,077 --> 01:12:32,414
But you've just signed
your own death warrant.

943
01:12:48,062 --> 01:12:50,831
You know, Jack, I...

944
01:12:50,832 --> 01:12:52,566
I feel like maybe

945
01:12:52,567 --> 01:12:56,036
you're not here
to give me my money,

946
01:12:56,037 --> 01:12:59,973
but you want to talk to me.
I can feel it.

947
01:12:59,974 --> 01:13:03,644
I'm in a lot of trouble.

948
01:13:03,645 --> 01:13:05,879
Something terrible has happened.

949
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:07,714
Yeah, like what?

950
01:13:07,715 --> 01:13:12,219
I... put a man
to sleep...

951
01:13:12,220 --> 01:13:13,720
For good.

952
01:13:13,721 --> 01:13:17,658
It was a total fucking
accident, I swear.

953
01:13:17,659 --> 01:13:18,992
- <i>An accident?</i>
- Yeah.

954
01:13:18,993 --> 01:13:20,227
<i>Shit happens.</i>

955
01:13:20,228 --> 01:13:22,596
The first time
I fucking killed a guy,

956
01:13:22,597 --> 01:13:25,032
it was kind of an accident too.

957
01:13:25,033 --> 01:13:29,169
<i>I was just trying
to talk to this guy, you know?</i>

958
01:13:29,170 --> 01:13:32,539
And he really wasn't
in the mood to talk,

959
01:13:32,540 --> 01:13:36,076
and so I had to get
a little bit rough with him.

960
01:13:36,077 --> 01:13:39,112
And then,

961
01:13:39,113 --> 01:13:42,616
I guess...

962
01:13:42,617 --> 01:13:45,552
He passed, you know?

963
01:13:45,553 --> 01:13:47,788
I had to throw him in the trunk.

964
01:13:47,789 --> 01:13:50,991
<i>But by me killing
this fucking guy,</i>

965
01:13:50,992 --> 01:13:54,194
I wasn't following orders.
What'd I do?

966
01:13:54,195 --> 01:13:57,865
I left this fucking guy
in the trunk

967
01:13:57,866 --> 01:13:59,633
for a long time.

968
01:13:59,634 --> 01:14:01,702
That's why they call you
Paulie trunks?

969
01:14:01,703 --> 01:14:04,505
Yeah. You're quick.
That's right.

970
01:14:04,506 --> 01:14:08,542
I don't... I don't know
how I got into all this mess.

971
01:14:08,543 --> 01:14:12,279
A woman.
And what is this woman's name?

972
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:13,947
May.

973
01:14:13,948 --> 01:14:15,883
May? May what?

974
01:14:15,884 --> 01:14:19,586
I don't...
I don't know, Seglio?

975
01:14:19,587 --> 01:14:22,458
Seg... Seglo?
Something like that.

976
01:14:28,029 --> 01:14:31,031
You fucked Duffy's wife?

977
01:14:31,032 --> 01:14:33,535
Well, no, I...
no, I didn't fuck her.

978
01:14:33,568 --> 01:14:35,569
I just... we just
messed around a little bit.

979
01:14:35,570 --> 01:14:36,937
You messed around
with another...

980
01:14:36,938 --> 01:14:39,106
you know, where we come from,

981
01:14:39,107 --> 01:14:41,174
that's a death sentence,
you know that?

982
01:14:41,175 --> 01:14:45,646
I myself would kill anybody
who did that.

983
01:14:45,647 --> 01:14:47,683
I understand that.

984
01:14:48,583 --> 01:14:51,184
And that's a good rule.
I get it.

985
01:14:51,185 --> 01:14:53,587
<i>But you didn't fuck her,</i>

986
01:14:53,588 --> 01:14:57,791
and Duffy
has a certain propensity

987
01:14:57,792 --> 01:15:01,595
for doing this kind of shit
to other people.

988
01:15:01,596 --> 01:15:04,731
Yeah,
his weird-ass brother, too.

989
01:15:04,732 --> 01:15:06,667
Yeah. Lewis?

990
01:15:06,668 --> 01:15:10,739
Yeah, now that crazy
motherfucker wants me...

991
01:15:11,773 --> 01:15:14,643
To kill her for him.

992
01:15:16,644 --> 01:15:19,146
<i>Madon, madon, madon.</i>

993
01:15:19,147 --> 01:15:20,881
What about a piece?

994
01:15:20,882 --> 01:15:22,249
A piece of what?

995
01:15:22,250 --> 01:15:24,786
You know, you know...

996
01:15:25,787 --> 01:15:26,920
A thing.

997
01:15:26,921 --> 01:15:28,789
A thing?

998
01:15:28,790 --> 01:15:32,659
I got plenty of fucking things.
What kind of thing you want?

999
01:15:32,660 --> 01:15:36,063
A gun.
I need a fucking gun.

1000
01:15:36,064 --> 01:15:37,698
Oh.

1001
01:15:37,699 --> 01:15:39,766
- You want a gun?
- Yeah.

1002
01:15:39,767 --> 01:15:41,234
You a tough guy now?

1003
01:15:41,235 --> 01:15:42,769
<i>Let me ask you something.</i>

1004
01:15:42,770 --> 01:15:45,641
<i>Do I look like
a fucking pawnbroker to you?</i>

1005
01:15:47,609 --> 01:15:50,112
<i>I got nowhere else to go.</i>

1006
01:16:00,688 --> 01:16:03,757
Make sure you get this

1007
01:16:03,758 --> 01:16:06,793
into Lewis's hands, you hear?

1008
01:16:06,794 --> 01:16:08,662
<i>All right?</i>

1009
01:16:08,663 --> 01:16:12,733
You know, when you
give a piece to somebody,

1010
01:16:12,734 --> 01:16:16,572
you start to then find out
who your real friends are.

1011
01:16:19,140 --> 01:16:21,274
- Are you my friend?
- Yes, sir.

1012
01:16:21,275 --> 01:16:22,744
Yeah.

1013
01:16:41,095 --> 01:16:42,863
I should put it in...

1014
01:16:42,864 --> 01:16:45,732
- no, you might blow your dick off.
- Oh yeah.

1015
01:16:45,733 --> 01:16:49,002
I'll put it
in the back. Right.

1016
01:16:49,003 --> 01:16:51,773
- Get out of here.
- Yes sir. Thank you.

1017
01:17:24,839 --> 01:17:26,039
May, you in here?

1018
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:27,841
Jack, what are you doing here?

1019
01:17:27,842 --> 01:17:30,043
I told you I'm going
to take care of this.

1020
01:17:30,044 --> 01:17:32,112
I didn't think
you were going to come back.

1021
01:17:32,113 --> 01:17:34,347
Yeah, well, surprise surprise.

1022
01:17:34,348 --> 01:17:36,717
- You going somewhere?
- We're going somewhere.

1023
01:17:36,718 --> 01:17:39,119
- We have to lay low.
- Just stay in your room.

1024
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:42,355
I told you
I'm gonna handle this shit.

1025
01:17:42,356 --> 01:17:44,159
Just stay there, don't come out.

1026
01:17:56,504 --> 01:17:58,136
You gonna kill me now, asshole?

1027
01:18:03,945 --> 01:18:05,312
Not now, motherfucker.

1028
01:18:05,313 --> 01:18:06,748
You fuckin'...!

1029
01:18:41,415 --> 01:18:42,884
Lewis.

1030
01:18:50,391 --> 01:18:52,928
Fuck you!

1031
01:19:03,971 --> 01:19:06,141
It's... it's over, may.
Put the gun down.

1032
01:19:10,845 --> 01:19:14,247
May, he's unconscious.

1033
01:19:14,248 --> 01:19:16,785
Put the fucking gun down.

1034
01:19:18,186 --> 01:19:20,020
Oh, Jack.

1035
01:19:20,021 --> 01:19:22,088
<i>I'll take it from here.</i>

1036
01:19:22,089 --> 01:19:24,960
I really, truly am sorry.

1037
01:19:26,127 --> 01:19:29,095
Pull the trigger, may.

1038
01:19:29,096 --> 01:19:31,533
You're so pathetic, honey.
Don't beg.

1039
01:19:33,968 --> 01:19:35,236
Goodbye, Jack.

1040
01:19:54,255 --> 01:19:56,091
Holy shit.

1041
01:20:20,915 --> 01:20:22,649
Get rid of this for me.

1042
01:20:22,650 --> 01:20:24,885
What am I, David Copperfield?

1043
01:20:24,886 --> 01:20:26,188
Yeah.

1044
01:20:28,389 --> 01:20:30,624
I'll let you live
under one condition,

1045
01:20:30,625 --> 01:20:32,092
you get the fuck out of here.

1046
01:20:32,093 --> 01:20:34,462
I don't want to see you
again, you understand?

1047
01:20:35,963 --> 01:20:38,066
Do you understand me?

1048
01:20:41,002 --> 01:20:43,003
Yeah, I... I understand.

1049
01:20:43,004 --> 01:20:45,105
All right,
get the fuck out of here.

1050
01:20:45,106 --> 01:20:47,374
- Yeah, yeah.
- You're welcome.

1051
01:20:47,375 --> 01:20:49,109
Thank you.

1052
01:20:49,110 --> 01:20:51,244
I'll take that, Jack.

1053
01:20:51,245 --> 01:20:55,083
And, Jack, don't forget
about that death warrant.

1054
01:21:36,157 --> 01:21:39,592
Okay, killer, stay here
and watch this bag.

1055
01:21:39,593 --> 01:21:42,629
I'm going to go say goodbye
to some old friends, okay?

1056
01:21:42,630 --> 01:21:44,165
I'll be right back.

1057
01:21:51,205 --> 01:21:54,042
How's that Viagra
working out for you?

1058
01:21:55,676 --> 01:21:58,144
Hey, Jack, the usual?

1059
01:21:58,145 --> 01:22:00,048
No.

1060
01:22:01,415 --> 01:22:03,518
No, not today, buddy.

1061
01:22:07,621 --> 01:22:09,624
You know, you look like shit.

1062
01:22:11,659 --> 01:22:14,496
Yeah, look at you.

1063
01:22:18,766 --> 01:22:21,201
I'm not going to be
playing cards anymore, Oscar.

1064
01:22:21,202 --> 01:22:25,105
And I've been asked
to leave town, tonight,

1065
01:22:25,106 --> 01:22:27,407
for good. That's it.

1066
01:22:27,408 --> 01:22:29,644
What are you doing here then?

1067
01:22:32,013 --> 01:22:34,182
I came to say goodbye to you...

1068
01:22:36,150 --> 01:22:38,351
And thank you
for trying to get me

1069
01:22:38,352 --> 01:22:40,722
<i>to quit gambling
all these years.</i>

1070
01:22:42,490 --> 01:22:44,726
I wish I'd listened to you.

1071
01:22:46,627 --> 01:22:49,064
Good luck out there, man.

1072
01:22:53,434 --> 01:22:55,103
Thank you.

1073
01:22:59,540 --> 01:23:01,176
Thanks, man.

1074
01:23:05,346 --> 01:23:08,515
- Stacey, my favorite waitress.
- Jack, what happened to you?

1075
01:23:08,516 --> 01:23:11,219
I was breaking up
a bank robbery.

1076
01:23:13,087 --> 01:23:14,521
This is for you.

1077
01:23:14,522 --> 01:23:17,257
It's for forgetting your name
all these years.

1078
01:23:17,258 --> 01:23:20,093
This is it.

1079
01:23:20,094 --> 01:23:22,228
I'll see you down
the road, okay?

1080
01:23:22,229 --> 01:23:25,131
Sweetie, get me a gin and tonic.

1081
01:23:25,132 --> 01:23:29,803
Jesus, Jack,
what happened to you, man?

1082
01:23:29,804 --> 01:23:32,305
You don't want to hear it.

1083
01:23:32,306 --> 01:23:35,110
Good luck to you, Jack.

1084
01:23:43,551 --> 01:23:46,152
<i>Stephanie, honey, get the door.</i>

1085
01:23:46,153 --> 01:23:48,321
Mom, can you get it?

1086
01:23:48,322 --> 01:23:51,760
<i>No, Stephanie, get the door,
I'm in the middle of something.</i>

1087
01:23:56,297 --> 01:23:59,601
Stephanie, that better be
homework you're doing.

1088
01:24:07,741 --> 01:24:10,545
Jack?
