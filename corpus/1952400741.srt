00:48:24,461 --> 00:48:27,965
THANKSGIVING DAY, 1952,
2:00 IN THE AFTERNOON,

1246
00:48:27,965 --> 00:48:29,968
MY SISTER
BROUGHT THAT FELLOW

1247
00:48:29,968 --> 00:48:31,469
TO OUR HOUSE
FOR DINNER,

1248
00:48:31,469 --> 00:48:34,472
AFTER HIS OWN MOTHER HAD
STUFFED HIM TO THE GILLS.

1249
00:48:34,472 --> 00:48:37,475
AND STILL HE ATE...

1250
00:48:37,475 --> 00:48:40,478
LIKE A HORSE
IN A UNIFORM.

1251
00:48:40,478 --> 00:48:42,981
CLAUDIA, BE A GOOD GIRL.
PASS THE CRANBERRY SAUCE.

1252
00:48:42,981 --> 00:48:45,984
OH, I COULDN'T TAKE
MY EYES OFF THAT...

1253
00:48:45,984 --> 00:48:47,485
DARK BLUE UNIFORM

1254
00:48:47,986 --> 00:48:50,488
AND THOSE BRIGHT
SILVER WINGS

1255
00:48:50,989 --> 00:48:53,492
AND HIS BIG,
STRONG HANDS.

1256
00:48:53,993 --> 00:48:56,996
AND HE HAD
A LITTLE MUSTACHE.

1257
00:49:00,499 --> 00:49:02,501
I THINK
WE SHOULD JUST--

1258
00:49:02,501 --> 00:49:03,502
STAY OUT OF IT.

1259
00:49:03,502 --> 00:49:06,006
I THINK WE GOT
TO HEAR THIS.

1260
00:49:06,505 --> 00:49:08,123
GO FOR IT, GLAD.

1261
00:49:10,509 --> 00:49:14,013
I WAS 18 YEARS OLD,
AND HE WAS ONLY 21,

1262
00:49:14,013 --> 00:49:17,017
AND WE WERE BOTH
SO NICE-LOOKING.

1263
00:49:19,019 --> 00:49:22,522
I CAN STILL TASTE
THE SALT ON HIS LIPS,

1264
00:49:22,522 --> 00:49:24,524
THOSE SOFT, SOFT LIPS,

1265
00:49:24,524 --> 00:49:26,026
AND THAT TICKLY LITTLE--

1266
00:49:26,026 --> 00:49:28,529
OH, TICKLY, TICKLY
LITTLE MUSTACHE.

1267
00:49:28,529 --> 00:49:32,533
I CAN STILL FEEL IT
43 YEARS LATER,

1268
00:49:32,533 --> 00:49:34,534
LIKE A TOOTHBRUSH.

1269
00:49:37,037 --> 00:49:39,039
HE KISSED ME.

1270
00:49:39,039 --> 00:49:41,042
WHEN?

1271
00:49:41,042 --> 00:49:43,044
ONE CHRISTMAS EVE.

1272
00:49:43,044 --> 00:49:44,545
AND FOR ONE
SPECIAL MOMENT,

1273
00:49:44,545 --> 00:49:46,547
MY OWN LITTLE LIFE

1274
00:49:46,547 --> 00:49:50,051
WAS AS BIG AS I COULD
EVER WANT IT TO BE.

1275
00:49:53,055 --> 00:49:56,058
TO HAVE SOMEONE
SO CLOSE TO YOU,

1276
00:49:56,058 --> 00:49:58,060
THEY'RE INSIDE YOU,
WHEN YOU'RE FEELING

1277
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:01,062
SMALL AND SCARED
AND JUST...

1278
00:50:01,062 --> 00:50:05,567
SO...DISAPPOINTED
IN YOURSELF.

1279
00:50:09,571 --> 00:50:12,074
AND WHENEVER
I LOOK AT YOUR FATHER,

1280
00:50:12,407 --> 00:50:14,576
I KNOW HOW LUCKY

1281
00:50:14,576 --> 00:50:17,080
MY SISTER MUST BE,

1282
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:21,084
BECAUSE HE MADE ALL MY
DREAMS COME TRUE FOR HER.

1283
00:50:23,086 --> 00:50:25,088
I WAS A LATIN TEACHER.

1284
00:50:31,094 --> 00:50:32,595
HOLY SHIT.

1285
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:38,101
UH, LEO,

1286
00:50:38,101 --> 00:50:40,604
LEO, WOULD YOU
PASS MY STUFFING?

1287
00:50:40,604 --> 00:50:42,106
AND TELL US
WHAT YOU DID

1288
00:50:42,106 --> 00:50:44,608
BEFORE YOU WENT TO WORK
FOR OUR BOY.

1289
00:50:44,608 --> 00:50:46,560
I GOT FIRED A LOT.

1290
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:48,112
OH.

1291
00:50:48,112 --> 00:50:49,113
JESUS CHRIST,

1292
00:50:49,613 --> 00:50:50,615
NO RELIEF
IN SIGHT HERE.

1293
00:50:51,116 --> 00:50:53,118
I'LL CUT IT.

1294
00:50:53,118 --> 00:50:56,120
SO, WALTER, HOW'S
THE BANK BUSINESS?

1295
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:58,122
GOT ANY NEW
FEDERAL REGULATORS

1296
00:50:58,122 --> 00:51:00,124
BREATHING DOWN YOUR
THROAT THIS WEEK?

1297
00:51:00,124 --> 00:51:01,125
NO, HENRY,

1298
00:51:01,125 --> 00:51:03,128
WE ARE QUITE
SQUEAKY CLEAN.

1299
00:51:03,328 --> 00:51:06,631
OH, SO I SHOULD GIVE
YOU GUYS MY MONEY?

1300
00:51:06,631 --> 00:51:07,632
WELL, HENRY,
CONSIDERING THAT

1301
00:51:07,632 --> 00:51:08,633
AT THE PRESENT
MOMENT IN TIME

1302
00:51:09,134 --> 00:51:10,135
CASH IS KING--

1303
00:51:10,135 --> 00:51:11,136
I WANT THAT GRAVY.

1304
00:51:11,503 --> 00:51:13,638
NO, IT'S TERRIBLE.

1305
00:51:13,638 --> 00:51:15,141
'CAUSE IT'S JOANNE'S,
NOT HERS.

1306
00:51:15,141 --> 00:51:16,642
I WAS TALKING HERE.

1307
00:51:16,642 --> 00:51:17,643
AH-CHOO!

1308
00:51:17,643 --> 00:51:18,644
BLESS YOU.

1309
00:51:18,644 --> 00:51:21,146
WHEN YOU SAY CASH IS
KING, WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

1310
00:51:21,146 --> 00:51:22,647
CASH IS
THE FOSSIL FUEL THAT

1311
00:51:23,148 --> 00:51:24,149
KEEPS OUR ECONOMIC
PISTONS PUMPING.

1312
00:51:24,149 --> 00:51:26,152
WHO WANTS A LEG?

1313
00:51:26,152 --> 00:51:27,653
YOU A LEG MAN?

1314
00:51:27,653 --> 00:51:29,655
NO, NO, NO.
HE WANTS

1315
00:51:29,655 --> 00:51:31,657
LEAN WHITE MEAT
FROM OUR TURKEY.

1316
00:51:32,158 --> 00:51:34,660
NEVER MIND A LEG.
HERE, HAVE A WING.

1317
00:51:35,161 --> 00:51:36,662
THAT'S
AN ACTUAL REPLICATION

1318
00:51:36,662 --> 00:51:38,165
OF AN ACTUAL
CAPTAIN'S WINGS.

1319
00:51:38,665 --> 00:51:40,667
EVERY YEAR YOU
GIVE ME WINGS.

1320
00:51:41,168 --> 00:51:42,169
THEN WHY AIN'T YOU
WEARING THEM,

1321
00:51:42,669 --> 00:51:43,170
YOU LITTLE INGRATE?

1322
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:44,671
DAD,

1323
00:51:44,671 --> 00:51:45,672
DON'T.
DON'T, DAD.

1324
00:51:45,672 --> 00:51:48,674
IT'S A JOKE. THE KID
KNOWS IT'S A JOKE.

1325
00:51:48,674 --> 00:51:50,677
YEAH, BUT
JOANNE DOESN'T.

1326
00:51:50,677 --> 00:51:52,179
IS THAT MY FAULT?

1327
00:51:52,179 --> 00:51:53,180
HEY, CAVEMAN.

1328
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:54,181
AAH!

1329
00:51:54,181 --> 00:51:55,682
WHOO!

1330
00:51:57,551 --> 00:51:58,185
THAT'S WHAT WE NEED--

1331
00:51:58,185 --> 00:52:00,687
PEOPLE MAKING THINGS,
BUYING THINGS.

1332
00:52:00,687 --> 00:52:01,689
BUYING, MAKING.

1333
00:52:01,689 --> 00:52:03,691
PLEASE SIT DOWN.

1334
00:52:03,691 --> 00:52:04,692
GIVE ME A KISS.

1335
00:52:05,193 --> 00:52:06,194
THANK YOU.

1336
00:52:06,194 --> 00:52:08,196
WE JUST GET LOADED DOWN
WITH ALL THIS STUFF

1337
00:52:08,196 --> 00:52:09,697
THAT WE DON'T NEED.

1338
00:52:09,897 --> 00:52:11,699
WE GET FAT, LIKE, UH,

1339
00:52:11,699 --> 00:52:14,203
HUMAN CHOLESTEROL
OR SOMETHING.

1340
00:52:14,203 --> 00:52:15,703
IS THAT MY FAULT, TOO?

1341
00:52:15,703 --> 00:52:17,705
WHAT? WHAT
ARE YOU SAYING?

1342
00:52:17,705 --> 00:52:21,209
HUMAN CHOLESTEROL STUCK
IN THE SYSTEM, RIGHT?

1343
00:52:21,209 --> 00:52:23,711
BIG GOBS OF HUMAN FAT

1344
00:52:23,711 --> 00:52:25,714
CHOKING THE ECONOMY.

1345
00:52:25,714 --> 00:52:27,716
TOO MUCH STUFF,
YEAH.

1346
00:52:27,716 --> 00:52:30,219
WHAT?

1347
00:52:30,219 --> 00:52:31,220
WHERE?

1348
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:32,221
EVERYWHERE.

1349
00:52:32,721 --> 00:52:34,223
WE CARRY AROUND ALL
THIS EXCESS BAGGAGE.

1350
00:52:34,223 --> 00:52:36,725
EXACTLY. WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THIS GUY?

1351
00:52:36,725 --> 00:52:38,728
YOU BET YOUR ASS.
CHOLESTEROL,

1352
00:52:38,928 --> 00:52:39,729
THAT'S WHAT I GOT.

1353
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:42,731
THAT'S ALL THIS BOZO IN
THE WHITE HOUSE IS UP TO.

1354
00:52:42,731 --> 00:52:44,733
NO POLITICS
ON THANKSGIVING.

1355
00:52:44,733 --> 00:52:46,235
WHAT WALTER
WAS TRYING TO SAY,

1356
00:52:46,235 --> 00:52:48,737
MR. FISH,
IS THAT CASH IS KING--

1357
00:52:48,737 --> 00:52:50,740
THE POINT
I WAS MAKING,

1358
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:52,242
IF I MIGHT MAKE
MY OWN POINT,

1359
00:52:52,242 --> 00:52:53,743
IS THAT
IT IS HIGH TIME

1360
00:52:53,743 --> 00:52:54,744
ALL BANKS
GOT BACK TO SOME

1361
00:52:54,744 --> 00:52:56,246
ROCK-SOLID LOAN
FUNDAMENTALS AGAIN,

1362
00:52:56,246 --> 00:52:57,747
FOR HEAVEN'S SAKES!

1363
00:52:57,747 --> 00:52:59,749
EASY, WALTER, EASY.
DON'T LET--

1364
00:52:59,749 --> 00:53:01,752
NO, CLAUDIA. ENOUGH ALREADY.
FOR HEAVEN'S SAKES,

1365
00:53:01,752 --> 00:53:02,753
IT'S HIGH TIME
WE ALL DID. GET BACK.

1366
00:53:03,203 --> 00:53:05,256
OH, YOUR PILLS, DAD,
THE ONES WITH FOOD.

1367
00:53:05,673 --> 00:53:07,758
THE HIGH PRESSURE ONES
IN YOUR POCKET.

1368
00:53:07,958 --> 00:53:08,758
WHAT PILLS?

1369
00:53:09,208 --> 00:53:10,760
HOW CAN I
FORGET THEM?

1370
00:53:11,261 --> 00:53:12,512
IF I FORGET
THEM,

1371
00:53:12,763 --> 00:53:14,265
YOUR MOTHER
REMINDS ME.

1372
00:53:14,348 --> 00:53:16,767
I DON'T MEAN
ANYTHING POLITICAL.

1373
00:53:17,184 --> 00:53:20,771
YOU EAT TOO MUCH.
HE EATS ALL DAY LONG.

1374
00:53:20,971 --> 00:53:22,273
WE'RE AMERICA.

1375
00:53:22,439 --> 00:53:24,776
I OPEN THE CABINETS,
AND THERE IT IS.

1376
00:53:24,776 --> 00:53:27,279
YOU'RE PAYING FOR IT.
EAT WHAT YOU WANT.

1377
00:53:27,479 --> 00:53:28,780
DON'T ENCOURAGE THEM.

1378
00:53:28,947 --> 00:53:30,782
OH, EXCUSE ME,
MS. SIDDHARTHA.

1379
00:53:30,782 --> 00:53:32,818
DON'T COMMENT ON THINGS
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

1380
00:53:32,818 --> 00:53:36,287
DON'T START WITH ME,
BECAUSE YOU'LL LOSE.

1381
00:53:36,287 --> 00:53:37,823
I SAID COMMON SENSE,
DAMN IT.

1382
00:53:37,823 --> 00:53:39,324
NOBODY MAKES
SENSE ANYMORE.

1383
00:53:39,324 --> 00:53:40,826
NOTHING MAKES
SENSE ANYMORE.

1384
00:53:40,826 --> 00:53:43,328
RIGHT! NOT EVEN
THIS GODDAMN BIRD.

1385
00:53:43,628 --> 00:53:45,997
DID YOU SPOT WELD
THIS, MOM?

1386
00:53:47,833 --> 00:53:49,802
OH.

1387
00:53:51,838 --> 00:53:54,340
HA HA HA HA!

1388
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:56,809
HA HA HA HA!

1389
00:53:56,809 --> 00:53:58,344
YOU COCKSUCKER!

1390
00:53:58,344 --> 00:54:00,347
MOMMY!
Walter: SIT DOWN!

1391
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,348
BAKING SODA.
BAKING SODA.

1392
00:54:02,598 --> 00:54:04,350
YOU GODDAMN BASTARD!

1393
00:54:04,817 --> 00:54:06,903
YOU RUINED
MY MOMMY!

1394
00:54:08,855 --> 00:54:10,356
GET IT OFF ME!

1395
00:54:10,356 --> 00:54:12,359
YOU GODDAMN BASTARD!

1396
00:54:12,359 --> 00:54:14,862
GET IT OUT
OF HER LAP.

1397
00:54:14,862 --> 00:54:16,363
OK, OK CAREFUL.

1398
00:54:16,446 --> 00:54:18,448
AAH!

1399
00:54:23,871 --> 00:54:26,040
OH, SHIT.

1400
00:54:27,876 --> 00:54:29,877
HONEY, IT'S OK.

1401
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:30,878
LOOK AT MY TIE.

1402
00:54:31,044 --> 00:54:33,881
JOANNE, LOOK AT
YOUR FATHER'S TIE.

1403
00:54:34,181 --> 00:54:36,384
IT'S USELESS.
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.

1404
00:54:36,384 --> 00:54:38,386
YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW I FEEL,

1405
00:54:38,386 --> 00:54:39,888
AND, IN MY OPINION,
YOU DON'T EVEN CARE.

1406
00:54:40,388 --> 00:54:41,890
OPINIONS ARE LIKE
ASSHOLES, HONEY.

1407
00:54:41,890 --> 00:54:42,891
EVERYBODY'S GOT ONE

1408
00:54:42,891 --> 00:54:44,859
AND EVERYBODY THINKS
EVERYBODY ELSE'S STINKS.

1409
00:54:44,859 --> 00:54:47,395
HENRY, FOR CHRIST SAKES!

1410
00:54:49,398 --> 00:54:52,401
THIS HAS BEEN A COMPLETE
HOLIDAY NIGHTMARE!

1411
00:54:52,401 --> 00:54:54,403
I HAVE TO GO.

1412
00:54:54,403 --> 00:54:57,906
OH, GOD, JOANNE,
NICE DRAMA QUEEN ENERGY.

1413
00:54:57,906 --> 00:54:59,407
CAN YOU JUST SET IT DOWN

1414
00:54:59,407 --> 00:55:00,910
SO IT GETS BETTER FOR ONCE
INSTEAD OF WORSE?

1415
00:55:01,377 --> 00:55:04,413
YOU'RE CALLING ME
A DRAMA QUEEN, MR. PERVERT?

1416
00:55:04,413 --> 00:55:05,915
AHEM.

1417
00:55:06,048 --> 00:55:07,917
DAD, PUT
THE CAMERA DOWN.

1418
00:55:07,917 --> 00:55:08,918
RIGHT NOW.

1419
00:55:09,251 --> 00:55:10,920
HA HA HA HA HA.

1420
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:11,922
MOM, DAD,
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

1421
00:55:11,922 --> 00:55:13,924
TRY TO THINK BACK
LIKE A HUNDRED YEARS AGO--

1422
00:55:13,924 --> 00:55:15,425
I'M DEAD SERIOUS--

1423
00:55:15,892 --> 00:55:18,929
BACK WHEN YOU GUYS CAME BACK
FROM THE HOSPITAL WITH JOANNE.

1424
00:55:19,429 --> 00:55:20,430
TOMMY.

1425
00:55:20,430 --> 00:55:21,932
NOW, SHE WAS JUST
A TINY LITTLE BABY, RIGHT?

1426
00:55:21,932 --> 00:55:23,433
SO ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN.
IS IT POSSIBLE THERE

1427
00:55:23,433 --> 00:55:24,768
WAS A BABOON FAMILY
IN THE HOSPITAL

1428
00:55:24,768 --> 00:55:26,436
AND THAT
THERE WAS A MIX-UP?

1429
00:55:26,436 --> 00:55:27,938
AND MAYBE YOU
GOT THE WRONG ONE?

1430
00:55:27,938 --> 00:55:30,941
'CAUSE I'M NOT KIDDING
ABOUT THIS.

1431
00:55:30,941 --> 00:55:32,943
YOU LITTLE SLEAZY...

1432
00:55:32,943 --> 00:55:34,444
AW, GEE.

1433
00:55:34,444 --> 00:55:36,447
CLAUDIA, IT'S NOT
EVEN WORTH IT.

1434
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:39,951
NO, YOU'RE--YOU'RE
CALLING ME A FREAK?

1435
00:55:39,951 --> 00:55:42,954
NO, I'M CALLING YOU
A PRODUCT OF BABOON LOVIN'.

1436
00:55:42,954 --> 00:55:44,455
THERE'S A DISTINCTION.

1437
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:49,961
JOANNE.

1438
00:55:49,961 --> 00:55:51,462
NO, DON'T MUZZLE ME!

1439
00:55:51,595 --> 00:55:53,965
WE BOTH KNOW I AM THE ONLY
NORMAL PERSON HERE! I AM!

1440
00:55:53,965 --> 00:55:54,966
I KNOW.
I JUST--

1441
00:55:55,466 --> 00:55:58,469
YOUR SECRET'S SAFE
WITH US, CHEETAH.

1442
00:55:58,971 --> 00:56:00,973
MY SECRET?
OH, THAT'S GREAT.

1443
00:56:01,473 --> 00:56:03,475
LET'S TALK
ABOUT SECRETS, HUH?

1444
00:56:03,475 --> 00:56:05,477
CONGRATULATIONS, HONEY.

1445
00:56:05,777 --> 00:56:08,480
MAY YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND
LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER,

1446
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:10,984
MRS. GORDON, OR WHATEVER
YOU CALL YOURSELF NOW,

1447
00:56:10,984 --> 00:56:12,485
OR HE DOES.

1448
00:56:12,485 --> 00:56:13,987
DID YOU WEAR A DRESS?

1449
00:56:13,987 --> 00:56:16,488
DID YOU WEAR A WHITE VEIL
OR A BLUE GARTER BELT?

1450
00:56:16,488 --> 00:56:19,207
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
YOU MAKE AS MUCH SENSE--

1451
00:56:19,491 --> 00:56:20,492
NO SHIT.
YOU AND JACK?

1452
00:56:20,492 --> 00:56:21,994
YEAH.

1453
00:56:21,994 --> 00:56:22,996
WHEN?

1454
00:56:22,996 --> 00:56:24,497
3 MONTHS AGO.

1455
00:56:24,964 --> 00:56:27,500
WHEN WHAT? WHAT?

1456
00:56:27,667 --> 00:56:30,003
WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT
LATER, OK?

1457
00:56:30,003 --> 00:56:32,005
YEAH, NOW'S
NOT THE TIME.

1458
00:56:33,506 --> 00:56:36,010
WHERE?

1459
00:56:36,477 --> 00:56:38,012
ON A PUBLIC BEACH.

1460
00:56:38,012 --> 00:56:41,015
ALL HIS DARLING LITTLE
FRIENDS WERE PRANCING AROUND

1461
00:56:41,015 --> 00:56:43,016
LIKE IDIOTS AND FALLING
ALL OVER EACH OTHER.

1462
00:56:43,016 --> 00:56:47,021
HE KISSED HIM ON THE LIPS,
RIGHT IN FRONT OF...

1463
00:56:47,021 --> 00:56:49,023
OH, I COULD THROW UP.

1464
00:56:49,023 --> 00:56:53,027
MOMMY, I'M TOO BORED.
I HAVE TO GO HOME.

1465
00:56:55,529 --> 00:56:56,530
TOMMY.

1466
00:56:56,530 --> 00:56:57,531
WHAT?

1467
00:56:59,534 --> 00:57:01,536
DID YOU
WEAR A DRESS?

1468
00:57:01,536 --> 00:57:02,537
NO.

1469
00:57:02,537 --> 00:57:03,538
SORRY.

1470
00:57:06,708 --> 00:57:09,543
YOU KNOW, I HAVE FRIENDS
IN BOSTON, TOMMY.

1471
00:57:10,045 --> 00:57:11,546
DID YOU EVER
THINK OF THAT?

1472
00:57:11,546 --> 00:57:15,050
YOU KNOW THERE'S OTHER
PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD,

1473
00:57:15,050 --> 00:57:16,551
PEOPLE
WHO TELL PEOPLE.

1474
00:57:16,551 --> 00:57:18,553
I MEAN,
HOW EMBARRASSING.

1475
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:21,056
DESSERT LOOKS PRETTY GOOD.

1476
00:57:22,058 --> 00:57:24,060
YOU THOUGHT
THAT I WAS--

1477
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:26,062
I FORGOT TO TELL HER.

1478
00:57:26,062 --> 00:57:27,563
THAT TOMMY AND I WERE--

1479
00:57:27,563 --> 00:57:29,065
YEAH, OK? YEAH.

1480
00:57:32,151 --> 00:57:34,071
IT'S OK, HONEY.
COME ON. HMM?

1481
00:57:36,073 --> 00:57:38,074
JUST SIT DOWN,
JOANNE.

1482
00:57:39,575 --> 00:57:41,077
SO, CLAUDIA,

1483
00:57:41,077 --> 00:57:42,578
WE HAVEN'T HEARD
A PEEP FROM YOU.

1484
00:57:42,578 --> 00:57:45,081
HOW'S YOUR
GLAMOROUS LIFE?

1485
00:57:48,085 --> 00:57:49,086
HEE HEE.

1486
00:57:49,086 --> 00:57:50,554
MY GLAMOROUS LIFE...

1487
00:57:52,089 --> 00:57:53,090
MY LIFE.

1488
00:57:53,090 --> 00:57:56,093
MY LITTLE LIFE.

1489
00:57:58,096 --> 00:57:59,097
TOMMY?

1490
00:57:59,263 --> 00:58:01,099
YOUR GLAMOROUS LIFE?

1491
00:58:01,099 --> 00:58:02,100
HIT ME.

1492
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:03,600
IT'S ALL RIGHT?

1493
00:58:03,767 --> 00:58:05,102
THE GLAMOROUS PART.

1494
00:58:05,435 --> 00:58:10,241
WELL, SHE WAS JUST FABULOUSLY
FIRED FROM HER JOB.

1495
00:58:12,777 --> 00:58:14,612
YOU KNOW PLENTY.

1496
00:58:14,612 --> 00:58:17,615
I CHECK MY MESSAGES.

1497
00:58:17,615 --> 00:58:19,117
SHALL I CONTINUE?

1498
00:58:19,117 --> 00:58:20,618
OH, YEAH.

1499
00:58:20,618 --> 00:58:22,121
ALL RIGHT, WELL,

1500
00:58:22,121 --> 00:58:25,124
UH, NIECE KITTY IS
PROBABLY, DEFINITELY

1501
00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:26,125
LOSING HER VIRGINITY

1502
00:58:26,125 --> 00:58:28,127
AND PERHAPS GETTING
PREGNANT SIMULTANEOUSLY

1503
00:58:28,127 --> 00:58:29,128
THIS VERY
AS-WE-SPEAK-END.

1504
00:58:29,428 --> 00:58:32,130
KIND OF LIKE,
WELL, UH, LIKE--

1505
00:58:32,130 --> 00:58:33,132
KIND OF
LIKE HER MOM.

1506
00:58:33,132 --> 00:58:34,633
LIKE HER MOM.

1507
00:58:35,134 --> 00:58:37,636
AND THAT IS PRETTY MUCH IT
FOR HER GLAMOROUS LIFE.

1508
00:58:38,137 --> 00:58:40,139
NO, UH-UH, 'CAUSE,
UH, THE BOSS THING.

1509
00:58:40,639 --> 00:58:42,141
OH, MY GOD,
THAT'S RIGHT.

1510
00:58:42,641 --> 00:58:46,646
SHE WAS ALSO MAKING OUT
WITH HER 60-YEAR-OLD BOSS.

1511
00:58:47,147 --> 00:58:49,149
WHY DID YOU DO THAT?

1512
00:58:49,649 --> 00:58:50,150
JUST 'CAUSE.

1513
00:58:50,650 --> 00:58:52,152
JUST FOR SCUZZ.

1514
00:58:52,652 --> 00:58:54,621
NOBODY TELLS ME

AS USUAL, I'LL
GO CALM HER DOWN.

1526
00:59:20,147 --> 00:59:21,183
NO, NO,
I'LL GO.

1527
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:22,684
I SAID I WOULD.

1528
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:25,186
OH, JESUS CHRIST!
I'LL GO. IT'S MY WIFE.

1529
00:59:25,686 --> 00:59:27,188
OH, JESUS CHRIST,
I'LL GO. IT'S MY FAULT.

1530
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:29,857
I'M SORRY.
I JUST ACTED LIKE I WAS 2.

1531
00:59:31,192 --> 00:59:35,697
OK, THE REST OF US,
WE'LL JUST SIT HERE

1532
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:37,699
IN THE DARK

1533
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:40,202
AND KEEP
EACH OTHER COMPANY.

1534
00:59:40,202 --> 00:59:42,204
RIGHT, GLADY?

1535
00:59:42,204 --> 00:59:44,207
COMPANY.

1536
00:59:44,207 --> 00:59:46,209
WHAT ELSE
IS THERE?

1537
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:53,715
MOMMY, WHERE
ARE YOU, PLEASE?

1538
00:59:56,719 --> 00:59:58,221
SHUT THE DOOR.

1539
01:00:00,723 --> 01:00:03,226
ARE YOU OK?

1540
01:00:03,226 --> 01:00:04,727
YOU LOOK--

1541
01:00:04,727 --> 01:00:06,729
YOU LOOK OK.

1542
01:00:06,729 --> 01:00:09,233
IT'S ALL RELATIVE.

1543
01:00:09,233 --> 01:00:11,235
NOBODY MEANS WHAT THEY SAY
ON THANKSGIVING, MOM.

1544
01:00:11,735 --> 01:00:12,736
YOU KNOW THAT.

1545
01:00:12,736 --> 01:00:17,241
IT'S WHAT THE DAY'S SUPPOSED
TO BE ALL ABOUT, RIGHT?

1546
01:00:17,573 --> 01:00:18,741
TORTURE.

1547
01:00:18,741 --> 01:00:20,744
THAT AND GIVING THANKS
THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO

1548
01:00:20,744 --> 01:00:23,247
GO THROUGH THIS
FOR ANOTHER YEAR,

1549
01:00:23,247 --> 01:00:24,748
EXCEPT WE DO,
'CAUSE THOSE BASTARDS

1550
01:00:24,748 --> 01:00:26,750
WENT AND PUT CHRISTMAS
RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE,

1551
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:28,252
JUST TO PUNISH US.

1552
01:00:28,719 --> 01:00:31,756
COME ON, LET'S GO OUT
AND KEEP EATING, OK?

1553
01:00:32,173 --> 01:00:34,759
IT'LL ALL BE OK
IF WE JUST STUFF OURSELVES

1554
01:00:34,759 --> 01:00:37,762
TILL WE CAN'T EVEN
THINK ANYMORE.

1555
01:00:37,762 --> 01:00:40,265
NO, IT WON'T.
YOU DON'T HAVE A JOB,

1556
01:00:40,265 --> 01:00:42,267
MY 16-YEAR-OLD
GRANDDAUGHTER

1557
01:00:42,267 --> 01:00:45,270
IS HOPPING INTO BED WITH
HER MOTHER'S BLESSING,

1558
01:00:45,270 --> 01:00:47,772
AND MY SISTER'S
LOSING HER MIND.

1559
01:00:47,939 --> 01:00:49,774
I MEAN, ALL THAT
SICK GOBBLEDYGOOK

1560
01:00:49,774 --> 01:00:52,277
ABOUT WHEN WE WERE KIDS,
AND HENRY--

1561
01:00:52,277 --> 01:00:54,779
EVERYBODY'S OK.

1562
01:00:54,779 --> 01:00:58,284
AND TOMMY'S
SOMEBODY'S WIFE.

1563
01:00:59,451 --> 01:01:00,786
MOM, NO, NO.

1564
01:01:00,786 --> 01:01:03,289
UH, EVERYBODY'S
GROWING UP.

1565
01:01:03,289 --> 01:01:05,291
WE'RE ALL GROWING UP.

1566
01:01:05,291 --> 01:01:08,295
BOY, IF THAT ISN'T
THE NAIL ON THE HEAD.

1567
01:01:08,295 --> 01:01:10,297
OH, LOOK AT MY FEET.

1568
01:01:10,297 --> 01:01:11,797
OOH!

1569
01:01:11,797 --> 01:01:14,300
LOOK AT YOUR SNEAKERS.

1570
01:01:15,301 --> 01:01:18,304
WHAT'S WITH
YOUR SNEAKERS, MA?

1571
01:01:18,304 --> 01:01:19,806
OH, BUNIONS.

1572
01:01:19,806 --> 01:01:22,809
I THOUGHT I'D CUT SOME
HOLES IN THE CANVAS

1573
01:01:22,809 --> 01:01:24,311
SO AS TO
RELIEVE THE PRESSURE.

1574
01:01:24,311 --> 01:01:25,312
MY DAD.

1575
01:01:25,312 --> 01:01:27,314
YEAH, BUT BIG DEAL.

1576
01:01:27,314 --> 01:01:30,317
WHAT'S IT GONNA
BE NEXT WEEK?

1577
01:01:32,453 --> 01:01:34,455
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

1578
01:01:36,457 --> 01:01:37,957
WHAT IS THIS,

1579
01:01:37,957 --> 01:01:40,960
A COUPLE OF WOMEN ON THE VERGE
OF A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN?

1580
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,462
I HOPE YOU'RE
HAPPY, THOMAS,

1581
01:01:42,462 --> 01:01:43,964
I HOPE IT WAS
A NICE WEDDING,

1582
01:01:43,964 --> 01:01:45,966
AND I HOPE ONE
OF THESE YEARS,

1583
01:01:45,966 --> 01:01:48,469
YOU'LL SEND YOUR POOR
DEVASTATED MOTHER SOME PICTURES.

1584
01:01:48,469 --> 01:01:50,471
WE DIDN'T TAKE
ANY PICTURES.

1585
01:01:50,471 --> 01:01:52,473
THEN DON'T
SEND ME ANY PICTURES.

1586
01:01:52,473 --> 01:01:53,974
WHO WOULD I
SHOW THEM TO ANYWAY?

1587
01:01:53,974 --> 01:01:55,477
HOW DO YOU EVEN KNOW
IT HAPPENED?

1588
01:01:55,477 --> 01:01:57,979
'CAUSE I WAS THERE, JACK
WAS THERE. IT HAPPENED, OK?

1589
01:01:58,480 --> 01:01:59,481
IT HAD NOTHING

1778
01:09:47,302 --> 01:09:49,305

01:17:18,774 --> 01:17:22,612
I LEFT ALL HER CRAP
IN THE BACKSEAT.

1939
01:17:26,115 --> 01:17:28,117
HOW THE HELL YOU DOING,
WALTER?

1940
01:17:32,039 --> 01:17:33,123
HERE,
LET ME HELP YOU.

1941
01:17:33,123 --> 01:17:34,124
I CAN MANAGE.

1942
01:17:34,124 --> 01:17:36,627
SHE CAN MANAGE.
BOY, CAN SHE MANAGE.

1943
01:17:36,627 --> 01:17:39,129
HEY, IS YOUR MOM AROUND?

1944
01:17:39,129 --> 01:17:40,631
SHE'S
IN THE BASEMENT.

1945
01:17:40,631 --> 01:17:43,133
SHE GOT SO UPSET,
SHE'S WORKING OUT.

1946
01:17:45,135 --> 01:17:46,136
THANKS.

1947
01:17:47,638 --> 01:17:48,639
JOANNE?

1948
01:17:48,639 --> 01:17:52,142
STEP, BALL, CHANGE.
STEP, BALL, CHANGE.

1949
01:17:52,142 --> 01:17:55,647
JOANNE.

1950
01:17:55,647 --> 01:17:56,648
STEP, BALL, CHANGE.

1951
01:17:56,648 --> 01:17:58,650
LOOK, I'M SORRY,
I'M SORRY.

1952
01:17:58,650 --> 01:18:02,153
ALL I WANT TO DO
IS STOP THE CARNAGE.

1953
01:18:02,153 --> 01:18:05,156
I DON'T KNOW
WHEN I'LL BE BACK,

1954
01:18:05,156 --> 01:18:07,158
AND I FEEL AWFUL,
BECAUSE MOM--

1955
01:18:07,660 --> 01:18:08,661
MOM AND DAD...

1956
01:18:08,661 --> 01:18:12,664
WE DON'T HAVE TO ACT LIKE
WE'RE 10 YEARS OLD, JOANNE.

1957
01:18:12,664 --> 01:18:13,665
I'M 10.

1958
01:18:13,665 --> 01:18:15,166
I KNOW, SWEETIE.
SCOOT UPSTAIRS

1959
01:18:15,166 --> 01:18:17,669
SO I CAN SPEAK
TO YOUR MOTHER

1960
01:18:17,669 --> 01:18:18,670
FOR 2
GODDAMN SECONDS.

1961
01:18:19,170 --> 01:18:20,673
IF I EVER TALKED
THAT WAY--

1962
01:18:20,673 --> 01:18:22,675
STAY THE HELL
OUT OF IT, BRITTANY!

1963
01:18:22,675 --> 01:18:24,677
DO NOT YELL AT MY KID.

1964
01:18:24,677 --> 01:18:26,679
YOU GOT ONE SOMEPLACE,
DON'T YOU?

1965
01:18:26,679 --> 01:18:28,681
YOU SAID
A BAD WORD.

1966
01:18:32,686 --> 01:18:34,187
I'M NOT PERFECT.

1967
01:18:34,187 --> 01:18:37,691
LOOK, I SAID I WAS SORRY.

1968
01:18:38,190 --> 01:18:39,692
WELL, THAT'S GREAT.

1969
01:18:42,194 --> 01:18:43,196
YOU KNOW, YOU JUST THINK

1970
01:18:43,196 --> 01:18:46,199
YOU'RE SO MUCH BETTER
THAN WE ARE.

1971
01:18:46,199 --> 01:18:47,200
WHAT?

1972
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:48,201
HUH?

1973
01:18:48,201 --> 01:18:49,703
TAKE IT EASY!

1974
01:18:49,703 --> 01:18:51,204
DO YOU HAVE
TO DO THIS

1975
01:18:51,705 --> 01:18:52,706
IN THE HOUSE?

1976
01:18:53,073 --> 01:18:55,710
MOMMY AND AUNT CLAUDIA
ARE FIGHTING.

1977
01:18:56,127 --> 01:18:57,712
JOANNE, YOU NEED
YOUR HEAD EXAMINED.

1978
01:18:58,212 --> 01:18:59,714
DON'T TELL ME
WHAT I NEED!

1979
01:18:59,714 --> 01:19:03,217
MOM NEEDS HER PUZZLES,
AND SHE NEEDS TO LOSE

1980
01:19:03,217 --> 01:19:06,219
EVERYTHING SINGLE THING
SHE OWNS 40 TIMES A--

1981
01:19:06,219 --> 01:19:08,723
AND DAD NEEDS
TO WASH EVERY CAR

1982
01:19:08,723 --> 01:19:10,725
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
UNTIL HIS FINGERS BLEED,

1983
01:19:10,725 --> 01:19:12,727
AND THEY BOTH NEED TO KEEP
ME GOING 24 HOURS A DAY,

1984
01:19:12,727 --> 01:19:13,728
7 DAYS A WEEK, TRYING TO
ANTICIPATE EVERY SINGLE THING

1985
01:19:13,728 --> 01:19:15,229
THAT COULD GO WRONG.

1986
01:19:15,229 --> 01:19:16,230
SO, DON'T.

1987
01:19:16,230 --> 01:19:18,182
WHAT'S GOING
TO HAPPEN TO THEM,

1988
01:19:18,265 --> 01:19:19,735
THEY'RE GOING
TO EXPLODE?

1989
01:19:19,735 --> 01:19:21,236
THEY'RE GETTING OLD.

1990
01:19:21,236 --> 01:19:24,239
WE'RE ALL...
GETTING OLD.

1991
01:19:24,689 --> 01:19:27,743
THAT'S GREAT.
THAT'S GREAT, CLAUDIA.

1992
01:19:28,243 --> 01:19:30,747
SHOULD I JUST RUN AWAY
LIKE YOU AND TOMMY?

1993
01:19:31,247 --> 01:19:33,248
JUST LIVE IT UP--
NO GROWN-UP RESPONSIBILITY.

1994
01:19:33,248 --> 01:19:36,251
JUST WALLOW IN YOUR
OWN EXOTIC LITTLE LIVES.

1995
01:19:38,754 --> 01:19:42,759
YOU DON'T KNOW THE FIRST
THING ABOUT ME, JOANNE.

1996
01:19:45,261 --> 01:19:46,763
NOTHING.

1997
01:19:46,763 --> 01:19:48,765
OH, LIKEWISE I'M SURE.

1998
01:19:51,267 --> 01:19:52,769
IF I JUST MET YOU
ON THE STREET...

1999
01:19:53,269 --> 01:19:55,773
IF YOU GAVE ME
YOUR PHONE NUMBER?

2000
01:19:56,273 --> 01:19:58,691
I'D THROW IT AWAY.

2001
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:05,782
UM...

2002
01:20:06,784 --> 01:20:09,286
WE DON'T HAVE TO
LIKE EACH OTHER, JO.

2003
01:20:09,286 --> 01:20:10,287
WE'RE FAMILY.

2004
01:20:18,797 --> 01:20:20,298
DO YOU MIND?

2005
01:20:20,298 --> 01:20:23,301
THIS IS THE ONLY THING
I DO ALL DAY

2006
01:20:23,301 --> 01:20:24,803
THAT I LIKE.

2007
01:20:27,304 --> 01:20:29,590
I'LL LET MYSELF OUT.

2008
01:21:07,347 --> 01:21:08,849
WHEN YOU GO HOME,

2009
01:21:08,849 --> 01:21:11,852
DO YOU LOOK AROUND
AND WONDER,

2010
01:21:11,852 --> 01:21:13,353
"WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?

2011
01:21:13,353 --> 01:21:15,856
WHERE DID I
EVEN COME FROM?"

2012
01:21:16,356 --> 01:21:19,359
YOU LOOK AT THEM ALL
SITTING THERE, YOU KNOW?

2013
01:21:19,359 --> 01:21:21,361
THEY LOOK FAMILIAR,

2014
01:21:21,361 --> 01:21:24,364
BUT WHO THE HELL
ARE THEY?

2015
01:21:24,364 --> 01:21:27,868
IT'S LIKE...
DO YOU FEEL THIS WAY?

2016
01:21:27,868 --> 01:21:30,872
OH, SURE. PAR, PAR,
BOGEY, BOGEY, PAR, PAR.

2017
01:21:30,872 --> 01:21:32,874
THAT'S WHAT I GET
ALL SUMMER.

2018
01:21:32,874 --> 01:21:34,375
MY DAD PLAYS GOLF,

2019
01:21:34,375 --> 01:21:37,378
AND I ASK HIM,
"HOW'S YOUR GAME, DAD?"

2020
01:21:37,378 --> 01:21:39,380
AND HE TELLS ME
HIS LATEST ROUND WAS,

2021
01:21:39,380 --> 01:21:42,384
"PAR, PAR, BOGEY, BOGEY,
PAR, PAR, SON."

2022
01:21:42,384 --> 01:21:44,386
LIKE I'M PICTURING
EVERY HOLE.

2023
01:21:44,386 --> 01:21:47,388
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW TO PLAY GOLF.

2024
01:21:47,755 --> 01:21:48,890
I DON'T EVEN KNOW

2025
01:21:48,890 --> 01:21:51,392
WHAT EXPRESSION
TO PUT ON MY FACE.

2026
01:21:51,726 --> 01:21:53,896
I SWEAR TO GOD,
I WANT TO SCREAM...

2027
01:21:53,896 --> 01:21:54,897
BUT...

2028
01:21:54,897 --> 01:21:59,902
I JUST SMILE BECAUSE...

2029
01:21:59,902 --> 01:22:03,989
'CAUSE I FIGURE
HE WANTS TO SCREAM, TOO.

2030
01:22:08,411 --> 01:22:09,612
I'M STARVING.

2031
01:22:11,414 --> 01:22:12,415
ME, TOO.

2032
01:22:13,415 --> 01:22:15,918
ALL RIGHT! WE GOTTA
HAVE SOME OF THIS.

2033
01:22:15,918 --> 01:22:16,920
I LIKE THIS.

2034
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:17,921
WHERE'S MILK?

2035
01:22:17,921 --> 01:22:20,423
ON THE DOOR.

2036
01:22:20,423 --> 01:22:22,425
THAT'S IT?

2037
01:22:22,926 --> 01:22:23,927
SURE.

2038
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:30,884
I'LL NEVER EAT AGAIN.

2039
01:22:30,884 --> 01:22:34,387
I'M HORRIFIED ABOUT
WHAT I'VE PUT IN MY MOUTH

2040
01:22:34,387 --> 01:22:38,391
IN THE LAST 25 HOURS
AND 11 MINUTES.

2041
01:22:38,391 --> 01:22:39,391
UM...

2042
01:22:39,391 --> 01:22:42,395
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW
THAT MUCH ABOUT ART.

2043
01:22:43,897 --> 01:22:47,400
I KNOW ABOUT LIQUOR
AND FOOD AND...

2044
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:49,903
HOLD STILL. YOU GOT SOMETHING
BETWEEN YOUR TEETH.

2045
01:22:49,903 --> 01:22:50,904
WHAT?

2046
01:22:50,904 --> 01:22:51,905
SECRET INGREDIENT.

2047
01:22:51,905 --> 01:22:52,907
GET IT OUT.

2048
01:22:52,907 --> 01:22:54,909
SHUT UP. HOLD STILL.

2049
01:22:54,909 --> 01:22:57,078
AH AH AH...

2050
01:23:09,173 --> 01:23:12,927
HEY, WHAT IF MY PARENTS
CATCH US?

2051
01:23:12,927 --> 01:23:14,929
NO TV FOR THE WEEK.

2052
01:23:19,935 --> 01:23:23,939
AHHH...

2053
01:23:23,939 --> 01:23:25,440
THAT WASN'T ME.

2054
01:23:28,444 --> 01:23:31,948
I'M SORRY. I TRIED.
I HONEST TO GOD TRIED.

2055
01:23:32,165 --> 01:23:33,949
I'M SLEEPING HERE.

2056
01:23:33,949 --> 01:23:35,450
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE ON THE COUCH.

2057
01:23:35,450 --> 01:23:38,003
I'M SLEEPING HERE.

2058
01:23:38,954 --> 01:23:40,957
SO, WHAT'S GOING ON?

2059
01:23:40,957 --> 01:23:42,959
WHAT ARE YOU ALL UP TO?

2060
01:23:42,959 --> 01:23:44,544
HMM...

2061
01:23:49,966 --> 01:23:53,470
DID LEO TELL YOU ABOUT
THIS BAD LUNCH MEETING

2062
01:23:53,470 --> 01:23:55,472
WE'VE GOT
IN SALISBURY TOMORROW?

2063
01:23:55,472 --> 01:23:56,974
NO, I--I DIDN'T...

2064
01:23:56,974 --> 01:23:58,475
GET A CHANCE...

2065
01:23:58,475 --> 01:23:59,976
IT'S EARLY.
I FIGURE WE HAVE TO LEAVE

2066
01:23:59,976 --> 01:24:01,978
BEFORE DAWN, SO...

2067
01:24:01,978 --> 01:24:03,981
I'M GOING TO
MAKE MYSELF SCARCE.

2068
01:24:03,981 --> 01:24:07,484
NO. YOU KNOW WHAT?

2069
01:24:07,484 --> 01:24:08,986
I WILL.

2070
01:24:14,992 --> 01:24:15,994
GO GET HER, PAL.

2071
01:24:16,494 --> 01:24:17,913
SHE'S GOT HER OWN ROOM.

2072
01:24:19,497 --> 01:24:21,583
YOU SON OF A BITCH.

2073
01:24:26,004 --> 01:24:27,004
BE SMART.

2074
01:24:27,004 --> 01:24:28,506
DON'T BE STUPID.

2075
01:24:28,506 --> 01:24:30,008
BE SMART.

2076
01:24:31,009 --> 01:24:32,510
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

2077
01:24:32,510 --> 01:24:34,012
KNOCK, KNOCK.

2078
01:24:34,012 --> 01:24:35,013
GO AWAY.

2079
01:24:35,013 --> 01:24:36,514
WHO'S THERE?

2080
01:24:37,515 --> 01:24:39,518
LEO.

2081
01:24:39,518 --> 01:24:41,020
LEO WHO?

2082
01:24:43,105 --> 01:24:45,524
YOU CAN'T COME IN.

2083
01:24:46,025 --> 01:24:47,526
THIS IS
MY CHILDHOOD BEDROOM.

2084
01:24:47,743 --> 01:24:49,528
I'M NOT. I'M NOT.

2085
01:24:49,528 --> 01:24:51,031
I'M STANDING OUT HERE
IN THE HALL,

2086
01:24:51,531 --> 01:24:53,033
TALKING
AS QUIETLY AS I CAN

2087
01:24:53,033 --> 01:24:54,033
BECAUSE YOUR FATHER

2088
01:24:54,033 --> 01:24:55,534
HAS A GREAT BIG
BASEBALL BAT.

2089
01:24:55,534 --> 01:24:56,535
REMEMBER?

2090
01:24:56,619 --> 01:24:59,538
AND I AM TAKING
A HUGE CHANCE.

2091
01:24:59,538 --> 01:25:02,041
THAT'S WHAT LIFE
IS ALL ABOUT.

2092
01:25:02,041 --> 01:25:04,044
THAT ONLY SOUNDS GOOD
WHEN YOU SAY IT, LEO.

2093
01:25:04,428 --> 01:25:07,547
I AM WAY TOO OLD
FOR THAT.

2094
01:25:07,547 --> 01:25:08,548
WAY TOO...

2095
01:25:09,049 --> 01:25:11,051
WHAT ARE YOU, 70?

2096
01:25:11,051 --> 01:25:12,552
80?

2097
01:25:14,054 --> 01:25:16,557
AND WE LIVE SO FAR APART.

2098
01:25:16,557 --> 01:25:19,060
1,500 MILES.
IT'S A COMMUTE.

2099
01:25:19,060 --> 01:25:21,061
YOU'RE SCARED.

2100
01:25:23,063 --> 01:25:25,565
I JUST NEED TO GO HOME

2101
01:25:25,565 --> 01:25:27,568
AND--AND--NAG MY KID

2102
01:25:27,568 --> 01:25:29,570
AND--AND--
AND READ A GOOD BOOK

2103
01:25:29,570 --> 01:25:31,072
AND FIND A JOB.

2104
01:25:31,072 --> 01:25:32,573
OH, BE BRAVE.

2105
01:25:32,573 --> 01:25:34,075
DON'T BE SCARED.

2106
01:25:34,075 --> 01:25:35,576
COME ON.

2107
01:25:37,078 --> 01:25:40,082
LEO, LEO, LEO...

2108
01:25:45,087 --> 01:25:46,088
HOW'S YOUR NOSE?

2109
01:25:46,588 --> 01:25:47,089
IT HURTS.

2110
01:25:47,588 --> 01:25:48,089
MMM...

2111
01:25:48,089 --> 01:25:50,091
MMM...

2112
01:25:50,091 --> 01:25:51,593
