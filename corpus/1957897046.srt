0
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:31,941
We need to get out of here.

1
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:33,199
Hello?

2
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:41,241
When this stuff is over,

3
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:42,918
we're going to be looking
back on this and think,

4
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:44,711
dang, that was some crazy stuff!

5
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,852
Dad, somebody just,
somebody just broke in.

6
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:54,020
What? What?

7
00:00:58,558 --> 00:00:59,559
Go back to the house.

8
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,163
Can anybody help us?

9
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:04,597
It's the end of the world.

10
00:01:05,965 --> 00:01:07,567
Mommy!

11
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:08,634
Let's go.

12
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,939
Why is nobody helping us?

13
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:19,045
Where are you, Daddy?

14
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:32,459
All right, so we're coming
off the bridge into Manhattan,

15
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:36,629
and lo and behold, the lights
have failed on the train,

16
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:38,898
and we've been riding
in total blackness,

17
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:40,733
but everyone seems
pretty cool about it.

18
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,504
No one's robbing anybody,
and it's getting darker now.

19
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:48,575
It looks so cool.

20
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:51,211
It's like a disco party.

21
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:53,580
Look at the jewelry boxes.

22
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:55,248
Look at the jewelry cases.

23
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:57,884
This is crazy.

24
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:02,989
What the hell is going on?
Oh, really?

25
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:05,225
<i>Reports are coming in
of a massive grid failure</i>

26
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:09,562
<i>that has taken power out along
the East Coast of the United States.</i>

27
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:13,800
I was in the middle of a shower,
and all of a sudden,

28
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:16,302
it went completely black.

29
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:18,171
Gosh, it looks like there's lights off.

30
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:20,740
<i>I understand everyone
would like to move, so would I.</i>

31
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:25,678
<i>I have no time estimation also
as to when we will be moving.</i>

32
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:27,080
The power's gone out,

33
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:31,317
so no Internet, computer doesn't work.

34
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:33,753
Nothing.

35
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,389
Mr. A, is it true that power
in the city went out?

36
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:38,391
Yeah, it looks like it did.

37
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,994
OK, what are the odds

38
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,430
that Gemma is going to
explode the entire apartment

39
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:45,865
by pressing the wrong button?

40
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:49,636
And there's no proper instructions, even.

41
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:55,074
So far, we have no confirmation on what
is causing this devastating outage,

42
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:58,578
but rumors of a cyber attack
are already being mentioned

43
00:02:58,645 --> 00:02:59,913
by authorities.

44
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:02,382
- Go on!
- One more!

45
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:04,651
There you go! Lilly did it!

46
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:06,052
Mommy, I'm scared.

47
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:07,921
It's OK, we just lost power.

48
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:15,628
<i>We now have reports
that Texas has also lost its power</i>

49
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:19,098
<i>in what appears to be
a cascading domino effect.</i>

50
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:20,900
Check this out, guys.

51
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:23,469
I've never seen our power
act like this before.

52
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,071
It's so fricking creepy.

53
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:28,675
Oh, my God!

54
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:30,743
So the lights just went out
in the middle of class.

55
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,730
We were just taking science notes
and everything,

56
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:35,248
and people are freaking out.

57
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:36,683
The power is out.

58
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:39,552
It's weird because, when the power
goes out during the day,

59
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:40,863
you can't really tell a whole lot,

60
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,631
because, you know,
you got the sun coming in,

61
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:45,291
but seriously the power went out
and everybody is like panicking.

62
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:46,659
They don't know what to do.

63
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:49,062
Twitter is blowing up, I mean exploding.

64
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:53,032
There's reports of blackouts
happening all over the East Coast.

65
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,101
They're going in New York City,
so I don't know,

66
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:57,136
this thing might be bigger
than I think it is.

67
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:58,338
Hi, Chelsea, doing nothing?

68
00:03:58,404 --> 00:03:59,572
Are you doing nothing, too?

69
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:02,275
Nobody's doing anything today
'cause there's no power right now.

70
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:03,643
- No power.
- This is great!

71
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,745
<i>It's only thanks to emergency generators</i>

72
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:07,714

73
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,917
<i>Unconfirmed reports say

74
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:13,219

75
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:15,021
Whoa!

76
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,522
Oh, my God!

77
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:17,949
This is like a big deal right now.

78
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:19,359
We need to get out of here.

79
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,935
God. You can feel the heat
through the window.

80
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:30,436
Holy shit.

81
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:33,773
Oh, my God.

82
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:38,811
<i>With as many
as 100 million people now affected,</i>

83
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:41,147
<i>authorities in the West

84
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:45,285
<i>as they fear the blackout
will continue to spread.</i>

85
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:49,088
Well, this is my "End of the World
As We Know It" video.

86
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:55,128
So we still have power,

87
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:59,565
but Dad says it's not for long.

88
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:02,769
So what's happening, Dad?

89
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:05,471
Bugging out, son.

90
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:07,640
Come on, Sarah, grab this one here.

91
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,611
This is the real deal.

92
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:14,814
It's calm right now,
but you know what that means.

93
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:16,249
Yeah.

94
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,651
It's going to get crazy,

95
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:23,623
with riots, and we're going
to have everything.

96
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,025
<i>It has been an extraordinary last hour.</i>

97
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:29,195
<i>The entire East Coast went out,
Texas followed.</i>

98
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:31,664
<i>Officials confirmed a cyber attack</i>

<i>is the most likely cause</i>

100
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:35,735
<i>behind this catastrophic failure.</i>

101
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:37,837
Aww, does poor Cheryl
not want to go

102
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:40,573
because she doesn't want
to leave her boyfriend?

103
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,075
Go help Dad pack.

104
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:43,543
Do we have to go today?

105
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:45,912
Yes, honey, we have to go today.

106
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:47,890
Remember, we got to stick to the plan.
We talked about it.

107
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:49,491
But Jason's parents
come back this weekend.

108
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:50,850
Why can't we wait till then?

109
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:53,252
If he wants to come along with us,
he can.

110
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:56,723
If not, we'll drop him off somewhere.

111
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:58,257
He's on his own.

112
00:05:58,324 --> 00:06:00,660
This hopefully is the last video

113
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:05,231
before my new baby brother
comes out of my mommy's stomach.

114
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:06,866
Are you recording this, Molly?

115
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:08,134
Uh-huh.

116
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,845
It's moving quite a bit.
He's really moving.

117
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,104
He's moving.

118
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:15,241
Mommy, what happened?

119
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:17,443
<i>Forgive me,
I'm, I'm being told right now</i>

120

<i>that Los Angeles, Las Vegas

121
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,616
<i>they have all gone out as well.</i>

122
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:40,099
It's like a horror movie.

123
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,601
Ooh!

124
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:47,006
<i>It's looking like a total power outage</i>

00:06:56,949 --> 00:07:00,853
OK, in case we die,
let me get this on video.

129
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:09,262
Hey! So we are stuck
in the elevator at our dorms.

130
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:10,763
Um...

131
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:15,668
we are two days fresh
off of the college season,

132
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:20,406
I mean, the semester just ended
two days ago, and we are stuck,

133
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:22,141
the four of us.

134
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,342
And your name is?

135
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:24,777
Ken.

136
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:27,880
Ken! Nice to meet you, Ken. I am Matt.

137
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,483

00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,452
Uh, I'm Dee.

139
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:34,153
Dee, and you are studying?

140
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,655
Gender studies.

141
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:36,722
Gender studies!

142
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,090
Yeah, so yep.

143
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:39,759
Studying gender studies. Nice.

144
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:44,664
And you, my large friend,
you are who?

145
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:47,567

All the street lights are off.

153
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,962
I thought these street lights
were supposed to have battery backups

154
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,188
or some sort of backup
that saves the world

155
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:10,690

156
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:12,925
that don't know how to use a stop light.

157
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:20,900

00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,420
Our cell phones,
when we try to make calls,

178
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:16,122
have horrible reception,

179
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:18,824
and it usually says like
"Emergency calls only"

180
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,326
or "Congestion."

181
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,035
Ken, you were headed?

182
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:32,305
My brother's coming over from California
to pick me up.

183
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:34,040
OK, so...

184
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:36,642
So he knows
we're at the campus, right?

185
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:38,144
Not exactly.

186
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,079
I told him I was staying at a hotel.

187
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:42,348
I didn't want my family
to worry about me.

188
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:46,285
So what you're saying
is they don't know we're here.

189
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:47,753
My brother doesn't know we're here.

190
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,388
Does anybody else have anybody?

191
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:51,657
I don't know.
Dee? Where were you going?

192
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:53,468
Well, I have to take a flight
back to Delaware.

193
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:55,127
OK, that's a no.

194
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:56,295
Yeah.

195
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:57,396
How about you?

196
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:59,041
I'm driving home.
I have a two-hour drive.

197
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:00,366
Where's, where's home?

198
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,368
I have a two-hour drive from here.

199
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,439
<i>The most immediate
concern for authorities</i>

200
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:09,642
<i>here in New York City is what's
happening in the subways.</i>

201
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:13,079
<i>Thousands are trapped
in the underground system.</i>

202
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:15,014
We're going into the abyss.
Maybe, maybe.

203
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:17,049
Don't step in water.
Don't step on anything metal.

204
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,618
When the power comes back on,

205
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:20,953
we don't want people
electrocuted down here.

206
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,489
<i>Emergency
evacuations are under way,</i>

207
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:25,257
<i>but with only limited backup lighting.</i>

208
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:28,227
<i>It's a slow and frustrating process.</i>

209
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:32,798
<i>Travelers evacuated from subways
and trains now find themselves</i>

210
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:35,334
<i>searching for alternate transportation.</i>

211
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,138
To your right!

212
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,513
I came out here to see
if any of the neighbors had power

213
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:51,183
or if they knew what was going on.

214
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,853
I brought the fob, and guess what.

215
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:56,889
It doesn't work when you're out of power.

216
00:10:56,956 --> 00:11:00,760
Oh, the electric key. Right?

217
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:04,764
This doesn't work.

218
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:08,934
You have that key,
and I left mine inside!

219
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,203
<i>You're listening to KMY-FM.</i>

220
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,773
<i>We're now four hours
into this extraordinary</i>

221
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,509
<i>national power outage,
and it is gridlock.</i>

222
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:18,177
A little freeway football.

223
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:20,146
<i>Signal failures, auto accidents,</i>

224
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:23,416
<i>and gas stations that are unable
to pump gas without electricity</i>

225
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:27,053
<i>have left hundreds of thousands
of drivers stranded on freeways</i>

226
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:28,287
<i>across America.</i>

227
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,990
Why are we going so slow?

228
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:33,292
Well, honey, the power's out,

229
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,936
so none of the street lights are working.

230
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,429
Has it happened before?

231
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:37,496
I don't know.

232
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:39,174
It'll be on soon,
so we just got to to be careful.

233
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,133
I want to stop and get some cash.

234
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,435
OK, honey.

235
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:44,470
Are you getting
any good stuff for your brother?

236
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,072
Yep.

237
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:49,809
I think the freezer's probably out
and it's melting right now.

238
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,444
No! Ice cream.

239
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,121
I know, you'd better go
home and eat it all, huh?

240
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:55,081
Yeah. Hurry up, Daddy.

241
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:56,415
I know.

242
00:11:58,684 --> 00:11:59,885
Everything OK?

243
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,954
The ATM's out.

244
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,262
Come on, come on, come on.

245
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:05,357
I can't.

246
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:06,424
Come on, wait.

247
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:09,228
There's no light, dude.
There's nothing!

248
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:11,063
We're on the express, you guys.

249
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,398
Wow, OK.

250
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:13,542
There's not
going to be doors for floors.

251
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,134
Lance, save your strength, OK?

252
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:20,539
I think I have a flashlight
on my phone.

253
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:23,209
<i>As the sun goes down tonight,</i>

254
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:24,910
<i>America is still in the dark.</i>

255
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:27,480
<i>The government has now
confirmed that a cyber attack</i>

256
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:31,217
<i>has taken down our entire
national electric grid.</i>

257
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:35,020
<i>But who is responsible?
Well, that remains a mystery.</i>

258
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:39,258
<i>Power companies say they are working
to fix the problem as quickly as they can,</i>

259
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:44,363
<i>but at this time we have no timeframe
for when the lights will come back on.</i>

260
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:53,773
Um, these are 99% of the reason
why I'm not walking down the stairs.

261
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,575
I don't want to walk down 46 floors.

262
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:58,410
And I don't even have
any money on me.

263
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:00,146
I can't even go get a latte.

264
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:05,184
But I could find you, maybe,
but I don't know where you are.

265
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:08,888
Hello, this is Jackson Burns
reporting to you

266
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:12,591
from a third world country,
Houston, Texas.

267
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,696
Batteries, more batteries,
all these batteries,

268
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:19,498
and just in case
those batteries run out,

269
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:21,167
where is it around here?

270
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:24,136
I've got my handy-dandy
solar charger right here.

271
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:29,008
So now we are going to walk
through a darkened house.

272
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:30,943
Ooh!

273
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:33,045
There it is, I got a lantern.

274
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:35,915
I got a lantern, guys.
We're going to be saved.

275
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:40,085
Don't burn yourself,
don't burn. OK. Don't...

276
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,387
Ow, that's hot!

277
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:42,721
Look at that beautiful candle.

278
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:44,857
A lot of people are kind of panicking.

279
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:47,726
And it's a big deal because
a lot of people aren't prepared.

280
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:50,196
You know, I have a couple
oil lamps, candles.

281
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:53,365
I never thought these Ikea candles
would be worth anything.

282
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:55,701
Can't tell you how happy I am
to have these things.

283
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,846
Sugar britches, I'm going
to head in a little bit early.

284
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:01,740
All right, Mom, I'm kind of
the middle of something right now.

285
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:03,576
Can you please just, you know.

286
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:06,345
I'm sorry. I got to get going.
Don't... Be good.

287
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:08,156
Don't break anything,
don't burn anything down.

288
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,348
I won't break anything.

289
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,293
It's all good. Have fun.
Love you. All right, bye.

290
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:12,484
I love you, too.

291
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:14,271
I guess I have to start this
all over again.

292
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,789
<i>It's not all bad news tonight</i>

293
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:20,092
<i>as spontaneous blackout parties
take place across the state.</i>

294
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:23,062
What are you doing, Mrs. G?

295
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:26,799
We are cooking all of the food
because the freezer doesn't work.

296
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,401
Leftover pork chops and a little,

297
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:30,846
some hamburgers that we're cooking up.

298
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,138
My baby brother's in there.

299
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,174
You know, I'm two days overdue.

300
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:37,042
At this point, I mean, I just don't know.

301
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:39,144
It's pretty uncomfortable.

302
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:42,581
I don't envy you, with this heat, I mean.

303
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:44,016
I know.

304
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,527
The power's going to
come back on soon,

305
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,887
so hopefully I can just talk him
into staying in there

306
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:49,255
a couple more days.

307
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:53,392
<i>Experts are already predicting</i>

308
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:56,161
<i>a blackout baby boom
in nine months' time.</i>

309
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,897
<i>The motto this evening?</i>

310
00:14:57,963 --> 00:15:00,099
<i>Make the most of it while it lasts.</i>

311
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:02,134
Blackout! Blackout!

312
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:03,802
<i>I just received a full briefing</i>

313
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:06,639
<i>from our emergency response
teams, including FEMA,</i>

314
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:09,508
<i>the Department of Energy,
the Department of Transportation.</i>

315
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:13,345
<i>Right now the public should anticipate
that it may take time</i>

316
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:16,115
<i>for the power to get back on,</i>

317
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:18,851
<i>but the good news is
we will get through this.</i>

318
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:21,487
<i>Hundreds of people are still trapped</i>

319
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:25,524
<i>inside of elevators more than eight hours
after this blackout began.</i>

320
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,526
<i>I have a spokesman
from the fire department.</i>

321
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,262
<i>Sir, can you tell us
what is taking you so long</i>

322
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:32,031
<i>to get to these people?</i>

323
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,565
<i>We are
at full stretch right now.</i>

324
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:36,135
<i>Some elevators will have
returned to lower levels,</i>

325
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:38,413
<i>but if you know that there are people
trapped in your building,</i>

326
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,072
<i>then reassure them and contact us.</i>

327
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,975
<i>We will get all these people out
eventually.</i>

328
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:46,679
We're gonna get there, all right?

329
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:48,047
But I need you not to freak out,

330
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,215
'cause you freaking out
in this small space,

331
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,885
I mean, you're gonna,
we're gonna lose it here.

332
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,186
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

333
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:55,730
You don't have to apologize.
You're fine, OK?

334
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:58,057
Oh, no, oh, no.

335
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:01,360
Please, please be careful.
Just slide it or something.

336
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:03,095
Oh all right.

337
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:04,229
This is crazy.

338
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,197
Be careful.

339
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:07,399
Don't grab on to this thing
or you will fall.

340
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:09,568
Go!

341
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:10,995
Do you need a light up there, Ken?

342
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:12,905
It's like pitch black, OK?
OK, give me some.

343
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,741
Ken! Ken!
I have, here, here hold my phone.

344
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:19,378
OK, here, give him this.

345
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:22,014
OK. Oh, my goodness.

346
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:23,082
Go, go. You can do it.

347
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,148
Help him.

348
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:25,050
Yes!

349
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:26,285
What do you guys see?

350
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:27,619
You see anything?

351
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:29,655
There are no doors
up or down anywhere close.

352
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:32,925
OK, so we can't go up,
we can't go down.

353
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,194
No, Lance,
look, look, look, look, look.

354
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,662
Shine the light over there.

355
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:38,097
Look it.

356
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,498
There's a vent!

357
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:40,566
A vent?

358
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:41,800
We see light.

359
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:42,867
There's light, yeah!

360
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:44,136
How far away is it?

361
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:45,571
Five feet, like not even.

362
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:47,072
No, that's like 25 feet, man.

363
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:48,179
No, no, it's not that far.

364
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:51,844
OK, so here we are

365
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:57,916
and finally got here
to our bug-out house,

366
00:16:57,983 --> 00:16:59,651
so here is all of our stuff.

367
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:07,092
We could use your help.

368
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:08,327
- Dad, I'm tired.
- I know.

369
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:10,262
Yeah, come on, Cheryl, come on.

370
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:11,740
Jason, why
don't you come on up here?

371
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:15,534
I got some stuff I need you
to help me with.

372
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:20,806
OK, this is our, our sleeping
accommodations, OK?

373
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,242
This is mine and Mom's room.

374
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:26,412
And then, Hank Jr.,
your room's down at the end.

375
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:28,113
OK.

376
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,549
And this is your two rooms
right here.

377
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:32,384
Fancy.

378
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:35,954
Jason, you ever
pumped up a bed before?

379
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:37,189
Yeah.

380
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:38,536
OK, that's going to be your bed.

381
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,392
- OK.
- Cheryl, that's yours, OK?

382
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:44,129
And I want to see plenty of
space between you two, all right?

383
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:45,364
Dad!

384
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:46,598
I know.

385
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:48,667
OK, if I, if I get up on this ledge,

386
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,235
I can make that jump.

387
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:51,837
Did he just say jump?

388
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:52,938
Jump?

389
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:55,483
I don't think jumping right across
is the smartest thing to do.

390
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:56,608
If you miss...

391
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:57,852
Its not far. I'm not going to miss!

392
00:17:57,876 --> 00:17:59,154
I say we should think
of a smarter way

393
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:00,955
to try to get around it,
to kind of climb more.

394
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:02,481
You can't just jump!

395
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:04,583
I'm going to do it now
with or without the light.

396
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,385
Ken, please don't do this.

397
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:09,021
Ken?

398
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,422
What?

399
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:11,833
We're better off figuring
a way out to do this.

400
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:12,858
He is jumping!

401
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,293
He's really gonna jump!

402
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:15,427
Ken!

403
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:20,232
Ken!

404
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:23,402
Oh, my God.

405
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:25,637
I can't see him!

406
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:27,239
What do you mean,
you can't see him?

407
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:31,110
Ken!

408
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:38,317
Lance, just come down here, OK.

409
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:39,985
Just take
it one step at a time, buddy.

410
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:42,621
Here, here.

411
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:44,323
You need to..

412
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:49,161
Oh, my God.

413
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:50,596
Hey, hey, buddy, sit down.

414
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,732
I told him not to jump.

415
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,804
What do we do now?

416
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,944
I cannot believe
this is actually happening.

417
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:07,513
Oh, my God.

418
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:13,552
Lance, let me see your arm.

419
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:14,820
Oh, my God.

420
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:18,157
What is it?
What, I'm cut? Oh, I got a cut.

421
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:19,725
Yeah, that's pretty gnarly, dude.

422
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,827
That sucks.

423
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:23,328
OK, just keep your arm elevated.

424
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:25,731
I'm gonna figure something
to clean it out with.

425
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:28,567
Guys, guys,
we need to get out of here.

426
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:34,640
<i>As America begins
its second day without power,</i>

427
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:37,476
<i>engineers are now saying
that the damage to the grid system</i>

428
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:39,811
<i>is like nothing
they've ever seen before.</i>

429
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:42,881
<i>We are currently running
on emergency generators.</i>

430
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:44,650
<i>We cannot say how much longer</i>

431
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:46,952
<i>we will be able to
continue broadcasting.</i>

432
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,554
It's dawn in Times Square.

433
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,089
There's not a single Jumbotron running.

434
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:53,792
The only lights are the lights
of emergency vehicles

435
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,928
and news media.

436
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:57,663
They have their own generators.

437
00:19:57,729 --> 00:19:59,598
This is the Renaissance Hotel.

438
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:04,169
And as you can see, a lot of their guests
slept outside last night.

439
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:10,809
Ready?

440
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,077
Oh.

441
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:13,412
Um...

442
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:14,746
hi, my name is Andrew Payton.

443
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:18,917
I'm in 4601. My girlfriend Gemma
is filming this.

444
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:20,185
Hi!

445
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:24,289
The point of the video
is to document everything

446
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:27,559
that's gone wrong in the apartment
we just purchased.

447
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,863
While we understand that,
you know, the city's had a blackout,

448
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:35,367
the, the, the issue we're facing

449
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:39,104
is that there are literally no
fail-safes or contingency plans.

450
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:40,739
There's no backup generators.

451
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:42,741
To be frank, that's, that's unacceptable.

452
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:45,844
Toilet doesn't work.
Water doesn't run.

453
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,880
Elevators aren't working.
I live on the 46th floor!

454
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:52,317
Lights, there is no AC, our freezer,

455
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:55,354
$17-an-ounce swordfish just rotting.

456
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,889
There is a substantial level
of liability here.

457
00:20:57,956 --> 00:21:00,626
And we're, we're going to file a lawsuit.

458
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:02,961
And I'm not, I'm not
a lawsuit-happy kind of guy,

459
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:04,296
but I think this is,

460
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:06,163
in this situation,
I think that's appropriate.

461
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:08,000
<i>The blackout crisis continues,</i>

462
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:10,168
<i>with no clear end in sight</i>

463
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:13,105
<i>and a growing number of people
increasingly concerned</i>

464
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:16,441
<i>about their personal
food and water supplies.</i>

465
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:18,610
It's day two since the power went out,

466
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:20,178
and I'm here by myself.

467
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:22,180
We have a food crisis.

468
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:24,149
It's already defrosting.

469
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:26,060
I don't think I'm gonna be able
to eat this at all.

470
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:28,587
I'm by myself, if I get E. coli
that's not gonna be good.

471
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:30,956
I haven't been able to keep
in contact with my mom,

472
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:32,224
and I haven't heard from her,

473
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,493
she's out on duty being a nurse,
as you guys know.

474
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:35,927
When this stuff is over,

475
00:21:35,994 --> 00:21:38,497
we're gonna be here and we're
gonna be looking back at this

476
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:41,366
and be like, dang, that was
some crazy stuff.

477
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:43,535
<i>The few stores
that still have backup power</i>

478
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:46,371
<i>are reporting massive demand
for bottled water,</i>

479
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:49,508
<i>canned foods items,
batteries, and candles.</i>

480
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:51,410
<i>But with no ATMs working,</i>

481
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:54,313
<i>most people have whatever cash
is left in their wallets</i>

482
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:55,714
<i>to buy supplies,</i>

483
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:59,217
<i>and many are no doubt wishing
they had been better prepared.</i>

484
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:01,520
OK, that's on.

485
00:22:01,586 --> 00:22:02,921
You got that running right now?

486
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,356
Yeah, yeah, it's on.

487
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:06,091
All right, OK, Jason.

488
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:09,861
This is the tour of the house
of our compound, OK?

489
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:11,330
Welcome!

490
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:14,166
First off, this is where we get
all of our power from right now,

491
00:22:14,232 --> 00:22:15,834
since we're off the grid.

492
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:17,779
Basically, we've got two months
of power right here.

493
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:20,605
We've got 250 gallons of potable water.

494
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,074
Potable, what does that mean, son?

495
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,875
I don't know.

496
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:25,177
It means it's drinkable.

497
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:28,447
Enough canned goods to last
us basically four months.

498
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,115
That's called decoy food.

499
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:33,118
If somebody was to come in here
and ravage the place,

500
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,120
hold us hostage for our food.

501
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,356
They can take all that
that they want. OK?

502
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:38,423
All right.

503
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:39,891
We don't mind, we don't care.

504
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:42,494
I got a camera up there
and a weather station.

505
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:47,065
That camera, I can see everything
that happens on my compound.

506
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:49,201
360 degrees.

507
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:51,570
All right, watch your fingers.

508
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:56,708
That is our bunker.

509
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:58,710
Why don't you step back for a second?

510
00:22:58,777 --> 00:22:59,778
All right.

511
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:02,180
Here you go, all right.

512
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:07,152
All right, Jason, when we come down here,

513
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:13,492
that means it's hostile
or unfriendly topside, OK?

514
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:15,327
OK.

515
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:18,930
Right over here we've got the real food.

516
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:20,999
OK, this food right here,

517
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,168
we've got enough food
here for two years.

518
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,503
Isn't that awesome?

519
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:29,608
Right here, these are our
secondary bug-out bags

520
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:32,544
in case for some reason
we get compromised here.

521
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:34,713
Everybody has an assigned bag.

522
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:38,417
There's enough in there for us
to last at least two weeks, OK?

523
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:39,618
Is there a bag for me?

524
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:41,019
No.

525
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:44,790
<i>Americans are certainly showing</i>

526
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:46,124
<i>their ingenuity today,</i>

527
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:48,660
<i>finding all kinds of
alternative power sources</i>

528
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:50,462
<i>they never knew they had.</i>

529
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:52,531
So I'm sucking all the energy
out of the computer

530
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,199
and into our phones.

531
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:57,202
Instead of high definition,
we resorted to a wind-up radio.

532
00:23:58,637 --> 00:23:59,738
What is that thing?

533
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:00,939
Phone charger.

534
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:02,641
Phone charger? Is it working?

535
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:04,443
Yeah.

536
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:06,745
Lance is waking up finally.

537
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:09,147
I need water.

538
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:11,716
You need to take just enough
to wet your mouth. OK, buddy?

539
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,218
Seriously, just enough.

540
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,387
OK, I understand,
I'm not going to be selfish.

541
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,961
Lance!

542
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:24,563
Lance, no!

543
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:27,899
<i>America is running on empty.</i>

544
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,835
<i>With gas supply trucks delayed</i>

545
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:32,103
<i>and refineries shut down
by the blackout,</i>

546
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:35,574
<i>we're witnessing unprecedented
scenes of chaos</i>

547
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,744
<i>at the few gas stations still open
and able to pump gas.</i>

548
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,546
I had no choice!

549
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:43,281
<i>With millions of Americans stranded</i>

550
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:45,484
<i>and unable to commute without fuel,</i>

551
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:48,086
<i>the economic cost of this crisis</i>

552
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:51,656
<i>is already running
into the billions of dollars.</i>

553
00:24:51,723 --> 00:24:55,527
This is reporter Molly
interviewing everybody

554
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:57,362
in the neighborhood about the blackout.

555
00:24:57,429 --> 00:24:59,498
Why are all the grownups
staying at home?

556
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:02,834
Well, there are
a lot of different reasons.

557
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:05,303
The traffic lights aren't
doing so well right now.

558
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:08,540
They're not working too well,
and there are a lot of accidents

559
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:10,375
and people are getting stuck in traffic.

560
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:11,962
So that's kind of hard to get to work.

561
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,178
What are you doing?

562
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:14,646
Just trying to stay cool.

563
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:18,517
You just can't survive
without AC anymore, you know.

564
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:21,019
You make the best you can.

565
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:25,824
What is that?

566
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:28,326
We're trying to see if we
can find something, some news.

567
00:25:28,393 --> 00:25:30,161
Find something.

568
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,698
<i>As America
now enters its second night,</i>

569
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:35,233
<i>there's growing fear</i>

570
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,936
<i>that criminals could take
advantage of the blackout.</i>

571
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:39,471
Gas stations are closed down.

572
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,139
Grocery stores are closed down.

573
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:44,709
I'm hoping this doesn't
become a situation

574
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:46,411
where people start looting.

575
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:48,513
<i>Police say they are adding</i>

576
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,248
<i>extra patrols across the city,</i>

577
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:53,685
<i>but with no street lights
or security cameras in operation,</i>

578
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:56,354

579
00:25:56,421 --> 00:26:00,225
<i>and they are now advising
people to stay indoors.</i>

580
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:02,093
We're having kind of
a little blackout date.

581
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,229
I'll show you the setup.

582
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:07,332
First, say hi!

583
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:10,569
We ate all the good food.

584
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:12,537
We've got... What is that?

585
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:17,042
Warm champagne, yeah, and caviar
that your assistant gave you

586
00:26:17,108 --> 00:26:18,743
like a million years ago.

587
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:20,545
Cheers.

588
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:22,647
Happy blackout.

589
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:25,717
Oh, my God.

590
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:26,851
Jesus.

591
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,322
That...

592
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:32,390
That's close.

593
00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:33,992
Yeah.

594
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,995
We have to go down there.

595
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:39,965
- We can't go down there.
- We have to help!

596
00:26:40,031 --> 00:26:41,466
- It's 46 flights of stairs.
- OK.

597
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:43,053
What are we gonna do
when we get there?

598
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:44,903
We can't call anybody,
we can't do anything.

599
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:50,208
You don't know, right?
We don't know what's...

600
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,795
We don't know what's down there,
we don't know who's down there.

601
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:55,580
This is bad.

602
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:01,886
Good morning, everyone.

603
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:04,589
I'm feeling very optimistic about today.

604
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:10,495
I have a feeling
that the power's back on.

605
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:12,831
♪ Dum duh duh duh ♪

606
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:15,233
Hold up, um...

607
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:19,647
You hear that, too, right?

608
00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:21,006
Yeah.

609
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:22,750
Maybe it's like trying
to communicate with us?

610
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:24,619
Do you think it's the,
do you think it's running,

611
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:25,753
do you think
the elevator's running?

612
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:27,045
Hello?

613
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:28,446
Hold on, listen, listen.

614
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:30,782
It's like a tapping noise.

615
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:31,849
Hello?

616
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:32,883
Can you hear us?

617
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:34,019
Shh!

618
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:37,789
It's coming from up there.

619
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,257
From outside the shaft?

620
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:40,458
No, no.

621
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:41,826
Up in the shaft?

622
00:27:41,893 --> 00:27:43,128
No, where the vent was.

623
00:27:43,194 --> 00:27:44,972
Maybe someone is trying
to communicate with us

624
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:46,398
or somebody
who came back on campus.

625
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:47,632
I don't know.

626
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:48,843
I'm going to figure it out.
Hey, help me get up there.

627
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:50,001
Hold this.

628
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:51,670
Be careful.

629
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:54,539
OK, watch yourself.

630
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:55,874
Hello?

631
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,242
I can hear it.

632
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:01,413
Maybe it is Ken, I don't know.

633
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:04,382
Ken, is that you?

634
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:07,519
Ken!

637
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:21,032
No running water and no toilet.

638
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:26,604
I did something I've never done
before in a field yesterday.

639
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,140
A little waterless shaving right now?

640
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:33,144
Yep, the knees are the hardest.

641
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:35,413
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow,
ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:46,224
<i>In many cases,

<i>they're being asked

653
00:29:02,807 --> 00:29:06,311
All right, guys, so this is
my first-ever shower from a bucket.

654
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:08,747
It looks like I've got about
maybe two and a half gallons.

655
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:13,618
That's kind of going easy on myself
and see if I can do it with less.

656
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:15,353
Here we go.

657
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:17,422
Woo!

658
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:20,425
Do you want to be on camera?
There you are.

659
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:21,893
Hey, calm down, all right.

660
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,561
He's a little mad at me,

661
00:29:23,628 --> 00:29:25,206
'cause, you know,
the water's gone and everything

662
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,632
and he's kind of been just
drinking the soda with me,

663
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:28,967
and his cat food's gone.

664
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:31,469
I've been kind of scouring
around my house, you know,

665
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:33,805
looking for any kind
of water source,

666
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:35,140
anything that could help,

667
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:36,584
anything lingering behind the pipes,

668
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:39,644
but obviously, as you guys can see,
to no avail.

669
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:44,449
I wish that I had taken
several gallon milk jugs,

670
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:47,886
cleaned them out properly,
and stored water in them.

671
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,821
That would have given me
water to drink.

672
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:52,190
I wish I had a can opener.

673
00:29:53,591 --> 00:29:55,260
And of course, you know,
the obvious one,

674
00:29:55,326 --> 00:29:56,961
I wish I had a generator,
which I don't.

675
00:29:58,396 --> 00:29:59,731
You on that right now?

676
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:00,999
So. Yeah, what are you doing?

677
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:03,334
OK, watch this.

678
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:09,374
This is the inaugural initiation
of our bicycle generator.

679
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,909
OK.

680
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:13,311
Been wanting to use this.
I brought this up.

681
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:19,083
Jason, do you know anything
about bicycles?

682
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:21,452
For the most part, yeah.

683
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:22,930
All right, well,
you're going to like this, then.

684
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:24,556
Stick this back here.

685
00:30:24,622 --> 00:30:26,291
Um, can I help?

686
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:29,761
Straighten it out.
We slip that up like that.

687
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:32,230
Did your dad ever do anything
like this with you?

688
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:33,531
Not like this, no.

689
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:38,303
It should be charging,
we're at 51%.

690
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:39,637
Should I go faster?

691
00:30:41,105 --> 00:30:42,974
That's doing it.

692
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:44,442
Look at that, Hank.

693
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:47,478
We're already up to 59%. Isn't it?

694
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:48,580
Yeah.

695
00:30:48,646 --> 00:30:50,248
- You're doing a great job.
- Thank you.

696
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:51,649
Keep going for another hour.

697
00:30:51,716 --> 00:30:53,260
That way, you can have
a fully charged phone.

698
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:54,853
There you are.

699
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:56,287
All right.

700
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,324
OK.

701
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:02,961
Where's it coming from?

702
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:05,797
OK, it's...
I hear it, but let me listen.

703
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,298
All right, all right.

704
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:09,734
I don't know.

705
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:11,236
What's going on up there?

706
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:12,646
It, it also sounds
like a pecking or something,

707
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:14,572
like, like, like it could be birds.

708
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:17,642
- Birds? Really, Matt?
- Birds, really?

709
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:23,348
Wait, what is that?

710
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:27,118
Matt?

711
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:29,721
Hold on.
Just hold on a second.

712
00:31:31,756 --> 00:31:34,058
I think I see daylight!

713
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:38,496
We are finally
getting out of the house.

714
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:41,466
We've got a bit of cabin fever.
Right, babe?

715
00:31:41,532 --> 00:31:42,901
That's right.

716
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:44,478
Well, he actually does
have fever, I think.

717
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:46,137
You don't feel very good, babe?

718
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:47,872
I'm fine, love. Thank you, though.

719
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:49,240
His tummy's sick.

720
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:53,444
I'm probably only so chipper
because we're only like one floor in,

721
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:56,214
but going down, this seems
like a piece of cake.

722
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:58,917
Right? Oooh, cake!

723
00:31:58,983 --> 00:32:00,361
What are the odds
that there is going to be cake

724
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:01,853
at the corner store?

725
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:05,223
Hon? This video...

726
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:08,059
Oh, my God.

727
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:10,395
Oh, babe!

728
00:32:12,797 --> 00:32:14,232
Do you want to stop?

729
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:15,633
I'm fine, I'm fine.

730
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,868
We can go back up.

731
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,903
No, come on.

732
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:22,707
Just, just stop, OK?

733
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:23,984
Just stop recording. Just turn it off.

734
00:32:24,008 --> 00:32:25,008
OK.

735
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:30,315
<i>This lunchtime,
America's food supply chain is in crisis.</i>

736
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:32,717
These people here are
willing to pay $10

737
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,018
for a bottle of water.

738
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:36,921
$20 for a single jar of baby food.

739
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:39,557
<i>Stores are struggling to restock</i>

740
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:42,827
<i>as the food distribution
network is hit hard by the blackout.</i>

741
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:45,897
<i>From the cranes in the shipyards
that rely on power</i>

742
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:49,701
<i>to the trucks which rely on gas
to carry goods to warehouses,</i>

743
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:51,402
<i>America's food supply network</i>

744
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:54,572
<i>has practically ground to a halt.</i>

745
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:00,144
Anyway, I went to the corner store,

746
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:03,748
the only thing I could get
from there was a banana.

747
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,616
Now we're on our way to the store.

748
00:33:05,683 --> 00:33:07,418
Now this is really going to be fun.

749
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,354
We're going to be in there
with the crazies.

750
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:12,132
They're gonna be grabbing everything
off the shelf that they can find,

751
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:14,792
including crap that they would
never eat in a million years.

752
00:33:15,793 --> 00:33:18,629
The lines are
around the block, and uh.

753
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:21,966
Going into the real world

754
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:27,538
since the blackout started,
and it's looking pretty grim.

755
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:29,007
I don't have any money, man.

756
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:30,408
You know me, you know me,

757
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:32,543
I've been in this neighborhood for years.

758
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:33,778
What do you got to trade?

759
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,480
Gasoline? I'll give you gas.

760
00:33:35,546 --> 00:33:37,191
I'll give you ten bucks
for a gallon of that water.

761
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:38,950
Wait your turn, man.

762
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:42,053
Andrew, Andrew,
this is making me nervous.

763
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,988
Fella, I'll give you $30
for a gallon of that,

764
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:45,666
I'll give you 40 bucks
for a gallon of the water.

765
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:46,891
Back up. Back up.

766
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:48,302
I'll buy everyone in here
a gallon of water for $40.

767
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:49,326
No.

768
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,838
- Get away.
- $40 for a gallon of water.

769
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:51,996
- 40?
- 40.

770
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:54,132
- You got cash?
- I got a credit card.

771
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,633
Credit card? Can't you read?

772
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,035
All right, hold on, my watch.

773
00:33:57,101 --> 00:33:59,237
I have a designer watch
for a gallon of water.

774
00:33:59,303 --> 00:34:00,571
Are you kidding me?

775
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:01,815
Come on, that's not going to be
worth anything, get out of here.

776
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:03,250
- Get your hands off me!
- Get out of here!

777
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:04,542
You're out of your damn mind.

778
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:05,643
Let's go!

779
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:11,182
<i>Now we've received
multiple unconfirmed reports</i>

780
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:13,584
<i>of food-related riots and looting.</i>

781
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:16,421
<i>Police are struggling now
to keep up with the volume</i>

782
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:19,090
<i>of incidents
caused by the ongoing crisis.</i>

783
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:23,728
<i>The government has said it is
working closely with suppliers.</i>

784
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:26,297
<i>But with a growing sense of uncertainty,</i>

785
00:34:26,364 --> 00:34:30,134
<i>basic needs for food and water
may well lead people</i>

786
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:32,837
<i>to commit acts of desperation.</i>

787
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:35,940
Anything you can find,
like shoelaces, belts.

788
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:37,241
I've got a belt.

789
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:38,419
OK. You have
a laptop charger, right?

790
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:39,753
Yeah, I have, I have two.
I have one and a backup.

791
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:40,711
Anything
that's elastic would help.

792
00:34:40,778 --> 00:34:41,979
OK.

793
00:34:42,046 --> 00:34:44,525
Everything that we could use
to build a harness and get out of here.

794
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:47,652
<i>The most important message that I have
for the public right now</i>

795
00:34:47,718 --> 00:34:49,253
<i>is please listen</i>

796
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,723
<i>to what your state and local
officials are saying.</i>

797
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:54,092
I have a scarf.

798
00:34:54,158 --> 00:34:55,059
OK, that could help us out.

799
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:57,462
We have to make something
very sturdy and elastic.

800
00:34:57,528 --> 00:34:59,730
Will, uh, , some pantyhose work?

801
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:00,698
Perfect.

802
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:02,643
OK, I think we have everything
we need right here.

803
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:04,402
Let's start off with the belts.

804
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:07,138
<i>If the public's not following
instructions,</i>

805
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:09,040
<i>that makes it more dangerous for people,</i>

806
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,976
<i>and it means that we
could have fatalities</i>

807
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:13,203
<i>that could have been avoided.</i>

808
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:15,113
Hey, Mommy.

809
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:16,314
Hi, honey.

810
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,415
You OK?

811
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:18,492
Yeah, I am.
Your brother's just coming.

812
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:19,760
He is making a lot of
movements in there.

813
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,419
OK.

814
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:22,930
At least there won't
be any traffic, right?

815
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,489
We are a little low on gas.

816
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:25,957
Oh, come on.

817
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:27,801
So these two strap belts
are going around the legs.

818
00:35:27,825 --> 00:35:29,136
This will go around the lower back.

819
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,205
This white part right here's
gonna go around our chest

820
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:32,330
to keep our chest tight.

821
00:35:32,396 --> 00:35:33,498
OK.

822
00:35:33,564 --> 00:35:35,032
And these two straps right here

823
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:36,501
are going to go around
our shoulders

824
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:38,007
and we're gonna propel ourselves up.

825
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:39,213
Steve, I need to you to hurry up.

826
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:40,271
OK.

827
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:41,415
I need you to go faster, Steven.

828
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:42,540
I'm going as fast as I can.

829
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:43,687
It's going to be OK, honey.

830
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:44,985
We're gonna be with the doctor soon.

831
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:46,177
OK.

832
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:47,321
If you guys get out of here safe,

833
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:48,655
you guys get somebody
back out here to help me

834
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:49,790
and get me the hell out of here.

835
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:50,858
Yeah, I'm a little too healthy.

836
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:52,059
That's why I don't want
to make this climb.

837
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:54,252
Just listen, and let's
get this show on the road.

838
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:55,653
I can't make that climb.

839
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,221
I won't make that climb.

840
00:35:57,288 --> 00:35:58,523
Steve, please.

841
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:00,400
There's no stop lights,
so I got to be careful.

842
00:36:00,424 --> 00:36:01,359
We've got to get there safe.

843
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:02,793
Go faster, Daddy. Come on.

844
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:05,897
You'll be just fine.

845
00:36:05,963 --> 00:36:09,800
OK, Matt, how
about if I just go first, OK?

846
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:11,269
Yeah, I'd be OK with that.

847
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:13,070
Are you sure, Dee?

848
00:36:13,137 --> 00:36:15,173
Oh, Steve, I don't know
if I'm gonna make it.

849
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:16,674
I'm scared.

850
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:18,118
It's OK, baby.
This is how it's supposed to be.

851
00:36:18,142 --> 00:36:19,610
Mommy!

852
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:26,493
We need to get to a hospital!
Please!

853
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:27,652
Steve!

854
00:36:27,718 --> 00:36:28,953
Mommy!

855
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,088
It's not going to wait.

856
00:36:31,155 --> 00:36:32,356
It's not going to wait?

857
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:33,534
What do you mean?
Can't you hold it?

858
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:34,792
- It's coming now.
- Now?

859
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,194
It's coming now.

860
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,629
My wife's in labor!
Can you help us?

861
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:39,964
It's OK, it's OK.

862
00:36:41,098 --> 00:36:42,433
Mommy, are you OK?

863
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,568
I don't know what's wrong.

864
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:44,769
It's OK, baby.

865
00:36:44,835 --> 00:36:47,104
OK, lady, how you doing?

866
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:48,916
Sweetheart, do you mind
putting the camera down

867
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,384
and just holding
your mommy's hand for me?

868
00:36:50,408 --> 00:36:52,710
- Mm-hmm.
- OK.

869
00:36:52,777 --> 00:36:54,154
Right here, right here. This, this.

870
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:55,246
This, this, this.

871
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:56,356
Yeah, let's make sure it's tight.

872
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,182
Everything's going to be OK,
all right, Dee?

873
00:36:58,249 --> 00:36:59,850
You're going to make it up there.

874
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:03,054
It's far, but it's not that far,
far up there, OK?

875
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,722
Just look at the light, listen to me.

876
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:07,758
Whatever you do,
don't look down, all right?

877
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:08,926
OK.

878
00:37:10,127 --> 00:37:12,463
Make sure it's tight.

879
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:13,764
All right, OK.

880
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:15,633
OK, take the first step.

881
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,236
I'm right here behind you.
I'm gonna support you.

882
00:37:18,302 --> 00:37:20,204
OK. All right, I got ya.

883
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:24,308
Oh! Oh, God, I can't do this.

884
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:25,776
Dee, yes, you can.

885
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:27,478
Come on. You can do this!

886
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:30,214
<i>This afternoon,
the President has declared</i>

887
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:32,250
<i>a nationwide state of emergency.</i>

888
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:34,885
<i>And that means people
in all of the impacted areas</i>

889
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:37,555
<i>will be eligible for federal aid
and assistance.</i>

890
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:40,925
<i>Until power is restored,
U.S. banks and investment markets</i>

891
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,526
<i>will remain closed.</i>

892
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:46,097
<i>So as you can imagine,
the impact is being felt worldwide.</i>

893
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:54,405
There we go, right.

894
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:57,508
He's here.

895
00:38:00,578 --> 00:38:01,712
Can you say hi?

896
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:04,015
Hi.

897
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:05,316
He's so cute, right?

898
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:08,185
You were a little tricky,
weren't you, buddy?

899
00:38:08,252 --> 00:38:09,654
Is he one day old?

900
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,422
Not quite.

901
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:13,257
Ha ha! He's what? It's what?

902
00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:16,427
I don't know what time it is.
Probably half an hour old?

903
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:20,031
I love you.

904
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:31,409
Guys!

905
00:38:32,076 --> 00:38:33,778
Yeah, Dee.

906
00:38:33,844 --> 00:38:38,382
I made it to the top.
There's, there's this ledge up here.

907
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:40,117
Oh, thank God!

908
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:41,619
Can you see any way out?

909
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:44,221
I see the light,
but there's some sort of like,

910
00:38:44,288 --> 00:38:46,691
like grid or something in the way.

911
00:38:46,757 --> 00:38:47,825
A grid?

912
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:49,093
Yeah.

913
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:49,894
What does that mean?

914
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,228
I can't get through.

915
00:38:51,295 --> 00:38:52,530
If I get up there,

916
00:38:52,596 --> 00:38:55,132
do you think I can get through
with my knife?

917
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:58,369
OK, we're gonna try
and get up there, Dee.

918
00:38:58,436 --> 00:38:59,570
OK.

919
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:01,072
Hold tight, Dee.

920
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:02,498
I'm throwing down the harness, OK?

921
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,675
Hold on.
Let us get out of the way.

922
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,812
OK, watch out!

923
00:39:07,878 --> 00:39:09,046
OK.

924
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:16,520
<i>The blackout crisis continues
with no clear end in sight.</i>

925
00:39:16,587 --> 00:39:19,490
<i>Urban centers have been
the hardest hit by the blackout,</i>

926
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:23,928
<i>but suburban and rural areas
have not been immune to the crisis.</i>

927
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:31,235
Dad! Dad!

928
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:32,737
What?

929
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:34,405
There's someone at the fence.

930
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:35,940
At our fence?

931
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:37,007
Yeah, they want food.

932
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:38,209
How many people?

933
00:39:38,275 --> 00:39:39,610
One.

934
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:42,446
Are they on this side of the fence
or the other side of the fence?

935
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:43,848
The other side of the fence.

936
00:39:43,914 --> 00:39:45,149
Are they armed?

937
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:46,717
No, I don't think so.

938
00:39:46,784 --> 00:39:48,185
Slow down.

939
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:52,289
Afternoon.

940
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:54,492
Hey, hey, how you doing, neighbor?

941
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,327
What are you looking for?

942
00:39:56,394 --> 00:40:01,132
Look, you probably don't know me.

943
00:40:01,198 --> 00:40:04,802
I'm your neighbor.
I just live over there.

944
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:09,807
Well, look, we're kind of running
short on, on supplies,

945
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:12,877
so, food, water, we were just wondering

946
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:15,212
if you can help us out
with a little, a little something.

947
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:16,823
Maybe, maybe just
something that will get us

948
00:40:16,847 --> 00:40:17,948
through the day, you know.

949
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,251
What's happening?

950
00:40:20,317 --> 00:40:23,187
There's a neighbor, wants food.

951
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:25,322
I have nothing to offer you.

952
00:40:25,389 --> 00:40:29,593
I got, I got kids, man,
and a wife and we just...

953
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,661
Yeah, I do, too.

954
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:31,929
What are you doing?

955
00:40:31,996 --> 00:40:33,206
But you guys have been
coming up here all the time,

956
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:35,866
and I know you got to have
something you can spare.

957
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:37,735
Hey, we have a couple
extra cans of food.

958
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:39,236
We have a two-year supply.

959
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:40,313
What the hell
are you doing here?

960
00:40:40,337 --> 00:40:41,372
Get back in the house.

961
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:42,973
Get back in the house, Jason.

962
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,042
We have things to spare, Hank.

963
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:47,387
Just keep your mouth shut.
Just keep your mouth shut, Jason, OK?

964
00:40:47,411 --> 00:40:49,747
Look, I'm going to be very clear
about this, OK?

965
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:52,983
I don't have anything for you
or your family.

966
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:56,120
He even said it.
He even said you got stuff to spare.

967
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:57,888
I don't have anything for you.

968
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:00,791
I'm sure you can go into town
where there's the Red Cross,

969
00:41:00,858 --> 00:41:02,726
and you can go in there

970
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,595
and they'll give you
some supplies, OK?

971
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:06,464
We just need something
for today, man.

972
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:09,867
You're not going to get anything
from me today, OK?

973
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:11,936
The best thing for you to do right now

974
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:14,839
is to go back to your family
and take care of your family.

975
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:16,616
I have nothing.
You're wasting your time here.

976
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,775
Back off from that fence.

977
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:19,376
Please.

978
00:41:19,443 --> 00:41:21,545
Would you please
back off from that fence?

979
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:23,447
All right, all right.

980
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:25,625
All right, you keep those hands up
and you start walking.

981
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:26,817
All right, all right, man.

982
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:28,764
Jason, I need you to get
in the house right now.

983
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:31,422
You just remember this, man.

984
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,290
What goes around comes around.

985
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:34,837
Don't threaten me.
Do not threaten me.

986
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:36,861
I ain't threatening.
That's a promise, man.

987
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:41,832
Hank, has Jason gone?

988
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:43,234
Yeah.

989
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:47,638
OK, I want you to slowly go
back to the house, OK?

990
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:49,707
OK.

991
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:56,647
OK, it's right there.

992
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:01,552
You OK?

993
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:03,153
I'm OK.

994
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:06,557
All right, just, all right,
just lean back, just lean back.

995
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:14,698
Lance!

996
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:17,801
Lance!

997
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:19,136
I made it.

998
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,272
OK, OK, I found the saw.

999
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,742
How we gonna get through that?

1000
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:26,977
I don't know.

1001
00:42:27,845 --> 00:42:29,980
Hey, cover your eyes.

1002
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:47,164
Oh, my God!

1003
00:42:55,973 --> 00:42:57,441
Are you OK?

1004
00:42:57,508 --> 00:42:58,943
OK.

1005
00:43:07,685 --> 00:43:09,954
This is gonna take all day.

1006
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:12,957
We're not going anywhere.

1007
00:43:15,726 --> 00:43:18,062
<i>Earlier today, the President declared</i>

1008
00:43:18,128 --> 00:43:21,999
<i>a nationwide dusk-to-dawn
curfew effective immediately.</i>

1009
00:43:22,066 --> 00:43:24,702
<i>Leaders in Washington hope
to get a handle on the looting</i>

1010
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:27,338
<i>and the widespread crime
that's now being reported</i>

1011
00:43:27,404 --> 00:43:29,106
<i>all across the country.</i>

1012
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:32,977
<i>The number of gun-related incidents
continues to rise as well.</i>

1013
00:43:33,043 --> 00:43:36,447
<i>Expect to see the National Guard
in the streets very soon.</i>

1014
00:43:36,513 --> 00:43:39,249
<i>Please remember
that all laws remain in effect,</i>

1015
00:43:39,316 --> 00:43:43,587
<i>and criminal behavior will be prosecuted
to the fullest extent.</i>

1016
00:43:45,923 --> 00:43:47,391
Hey, guys, VJ here.

1017
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,293
Out in the streets.

1018
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,629
Man, I don't know what's going on,

1019
00:43:51,695 --> 00:43:54,398
but there are a ton of cop cars
out right now.

1020
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:59,036
Yeah, heard people talking about a lot
of break-ins happening

1021
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,647
in a whole bunch of stores around here,

1022
00:44:00,671 --> 00:44:02,306
and someone got shot.

1023
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:04,675
I don't know.

1024
00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:09,780
There's a lot of bad vibes out here,
and I got to get out of here.

1025
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:14,618
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1026
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:17,454
<i>at this point our generator

00:44:17,521 --> 00:44:18,956
<i>Now, in the days to come,</i>

00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:24,495
<i>and find you and your family

1030
00:44:34,872 --> 00:44:36,507
Come on!

1031
00:44:36,573 --> 00:44:37,908
OK, OK.

1032
00:44:45,049 --> 00:44:46,083
Open it!

1033
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:47,718
I'm trying!

1034
00:44:50,788 --> 00:44:52,756
Oh, my God. Oh, no!

1035
00:44:57,695 --> 00:44:59,630
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

1036
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:01,965
Come on, come on, come on!

1037
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:03,600
Come on, come on!

1038
00:45:04,635 --> 00:45:05,736
OK.

1039
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:13,477
Help us!

1040
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,879
Please, anybody help us!

1041
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:20,384
Where is everybody?

1042
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:24,021
There's nobody down there!

1043
00:45:24,088 --> 00:45:25,122
Oh, my God!

1044
00:45:25,189 --> 00:45:26,490
There's nobody down there!

1045
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:28,792
What? What?

1046
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:37,167
Help us! We're right here!

1047
00:45:47,277 --> 00:45:50,814
Last night I heard
some pretty interesting things.

1048
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:53,884
There's people out there
in a bad situation

1049
00:45:53,951 --> 00:45:55,219
who aren't prepared,

1050
00:45:55,285 --> 00:45:58,088
and they're, you know,
bad people do bad things.

1051
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:01,391
<i>You are listening to KMY-FM,</i>

1052

1054
00:46:07,531 --> 00:46:10,768
<i>President Obama is calling
for rationing and fair allocation</i>

1055
00:46:10,834 --> 00:46:12,903

1056
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:14,380

<i>the nation's food, gas,

1058

1059
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:21,211

1060
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:26,984
<i>As angry scenes continue this morning,</i>

1061
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:29,453
<i>FEMA has assured the public

1062

00:46:32,356 --> 00:46:33,624

1064

<i>who are now armed.</i>

1067
00:46:44,401 --> 00:46:46,770
Found this little bad boy
in Mom's closet.

1068
00:46:46,837 --> 00:46:49,273
Show this off to you guys.

1069
00:46:49,339 --> 00:46:52,176
A little preview.

1070
00:46:58,682 --> 00:47:01,518
All right, guys, I'm gonna take
my camera out with me,

1071
00:47:01,585 --> 00:47:03,821
gonna see what's going on.

1072
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:08,125
<i>Disturbances
have continued this afternoon.</i>

1073
00:47:08,192 --> 00:47:11,195
<i>Riot police are now at a number

1074
00:47:11,261 --> 00:47:14,031
<i>to contain and control
this volatile situation.</i>

1075
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:26,844
You know, we're just in the park,
you know, trying to get some water.

1076
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:29,413
There were people waiting
out there for hours,

1077
00:47:29,479 --> 00:47:30,480
probably all night.

1078
00:47:30,547 --> 00:47:32,149
All hell broke loose,

1079
00:47:32,216 --> 00:47:35,652
people started pushing,
and the cops came,

1080
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:37,387
and they were herding us like cattle.

1081
00:47:46,096 --> 00:47:47,564
I know my rights!

1082
00:47:48,398 --> 00:47:50,267
Water!

1083
00:47:50,334 --> 00:47:53,604
Pushing us around,
and batons and guns,

1084
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:56,106
almost like we were animals.

1085
00:48:05,616 --> 00:48:06,817
Good.

1086
00:48:10,254 --> 00:48:11,555
Stop, stop, stop.

1087
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:12,723
Yeah.

1088
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:16,469
I can't believe that just happened.

1089
00:48:16,493 --> 00:48:18,829
It's so bad out there,
I can't believe it.

1090
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:22,232
What is that?

1091
00:48:22,299 --> 00:48:23,700
Peaches.

1092
00:48:23,767 --> 00:48:26,770
Peaches? You, you stole peaches!

1093
00:48:26,837 --> 00:48:28,238
I just grabbed what was there.

1094
00:48:28,305 --> 00:48:30,173
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

1095
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,309
I should have got some, like, water.

1096
00:48:32,376 --> 00:48:33,744
I can't believe you stole it.

1097
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:35,712
I'll buy you a whole case of peaches.

1098
00:48:35,779 --> 00:48:37,848
I want an apology.

1099
00:48:39,783 --> 00:48:42,419
Gemma, stay back, stay back.

1100
00:48:42,486 --> 00:48:43,921
Oh, my God.

1101
00:48:43,987 --> 00:48:45,222
Give me that can.

1102
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:46,623
You serious?

1103
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:50,294
What are you doing here, man?
What are you doing?

1104
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:53,997
I've got kids. They're hungry.

1105
00:48:54,064 --> 00:48:55,933
Babe. No.

1106
00:48:55,999 --> 00:48:57,968
You're gonna mug me
for a can of peaches?

1107
00:48:58,035 --> 00:48:59,937
If I have to, I will.

1108
00:49:00,003 --> 00:49:01,314
I don't want to do it, but I have to.

1109
00:49:01,338 --> 00:49:02,539
You don't understand.

1110
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,775
No. No. No, this is all we have.

1111
00:49:06,076 --> 00:49:07,544
You've got enough.

1112
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:09,279
Look, look, look, look, take my wallet.

1113
00:49:09,346 --> 00:49:10,681
You can go out and...

1114
00:49:10,747 --> 00:49:12,382
The ATMs aren't even working!

1115
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:13,750
No!

1116
00:49:13,817 --> 00:49:15,161
I don't want to do this with you,
all right?

1117
00:49:15,185 --> 00:49:16,320
I really don't.

1118
00:49:16,386 --> 00:49:17,897
OK, I understand you're in
a hard spot. We are, too.

1119
00:49:17,921 --> 00:49:19,189
Put that camera away now.

1120
00:49:19,256 --> 00:49:20,266
Gemma, keep recording, Gemma.

1121
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:22,626
Stop! No!

1122
00:49:22,693 --> 00:49:23,827
Stop!

1123
00:49:30,267 --> 00:49:32,636
Andrew! No!

1124
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:42,546
There's more and more
people on the street,

1125
00:49:42,612 --> 00:49:45,816
and there's more and more fear
in people's eyes and violence

1126
00:49:45,882 --> 00:49:47,985
as I experienced today.

1127
00:49:48,051 --> 00:49:52,322
And uh, I'm scared.

1128
00:49:52,389 --> 00:49:55,726
I'm so hungry.
I'm so hot, I'm so frustrated.

1129
00:49:55,792 --> 00:49:57,728
I just want this all to be over.

1130
00:50:09,139 --> 00:50:11,341
Lance, buddy!

1131
00:50:11,408 --> 00:50:13,043
Can you hear us?

1132
00:50:15,045 --> 00:50:17,114
I'm gonna drop down the harness.

1133
00:50:19,149 --> 00:50:20,817
Here it comes, buddy.

1134
00:50:29,893 --> 00:50:31,795
I've got it.

1135
00:50:36,933 --> 00:50:38,235
Is he mad?

1136
00:50:38,301 --> 00:50:40,437
He's just a little sad right now.
It's OK.

1137
00:50:42,005 --> 00:50:43,940
Want to try feeding him?

1138
00:50:45,175 --> 00:50:46,977
Hey, listen, I'm gonna go,

1139
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:48,645
I'm gonna try and find us
some food, OK?

1140
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:50,313
'Cause I know you're pretty hungry.

1141
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,425
Listen, I have an important job
for you while I'm gone.

1142
00:50:52,449 --> 00:50:53,850
OK, an important job.

1143
00:50:53,917 --> 00:50:55,118
I have for you

1144
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:59,256
a box full of batteries
that fit right in your camera.

1145
00:50:59,322 --> 00:51:00,624
OK.

1146
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:01,925
OK, so I want you to use these

1147
00:51:01,992 --> 00:51:03,369
and make sure
that camera's always on.

1148
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:04,461
OK.

1149
00:51:04,528 --> 00:51:05,729
Don't miss anything.

1150
00:51:05,796 --> 00:51:07,874
So when I get back,
I can see everything that I missed.

1151
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:09,766
OK, you and Mom and Jack.

1152
00:51:09,833 --> 00:51:11,234
OK. OK.

1153
00:51:11,301 --> 00:51:12,769
Got it?
Can you take that mission?

1154
00:51:12,836 --> 00:51:14,071
Mm-hmm.

1155
00:51:14,137 --> 00:51:15,505
Do you promise you'll come back?

1156
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:18,475
I promise. Promise. OK?

1157
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:19,910
OK.

1158
00:51:28,985 --> 00:51:30,821
Bye, Daddy!

1159
00:51:30,887 --> 00:51:33,523
See you soon.

1160
00:51:49,639 --> 00:51:51,508
I'm gonna open the peaches.

1161
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:56,346
I can't open them, electric.

1162
00:51:56,413 --> 00:51:59,616
I didn't even think about that.

1163
00:52:05,589 --> 00:52:06,690
Is it working?

1164
00:52:06,756 --> 00:52:07,756
No, it's not.

1165
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:09,302
I'm just gonna get metal
in the peaches.

1166
00:52:09,326 --> 00:52:11,561
Aah!!

1167
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:14,164
Oh, my God, let me see!

1168
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:17,334
Oh, God.

1169
00:52:19,202 --> 00:52:20,670
Can you wrap it?

1170
00:52:20,737 --> 00:52:21,872
Yeah.

1171
00:52:21,938 --> 00:52:24,207
Oh, my gosh, that needs stitches.

1172
00:52:24,274 --> 00:52:26,376
It really does.

1173
00:52:26,443 --> 00:52:28,011
Just, just...

1174
00:52:28,078 --> 00:52:29,613
Here, tight.

1175
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:32,816
Here, eat this.

1176
00:52:34,451 --> 00:52:35,952
I'm in my closet right now.

1177
00:52:36,019 --> 00:52:37,220
I can hear people outside,

1178
00:52:37,287 --> 00:52:39,422
and it sounds like these voices
are getting closer.

1179
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:41,791
I can hear, I can smell burning,

1180
00:52:41,858 --> 00:52:44,528
I think people are setting fire
to buildings.

1181
00:52:44,594 --> 00:52:46,663
I'm getting really, really nervous.

1182
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:48,198
I'm not quite sure
what I should do.

1183
00:52:49,065 --> 00:52:52,736
Mommy! Mommy!

1184
00:52:52,802 --> 00:52:54,171
Why, what happened?

1185
00:52:54,237 --> 00:52:56,940
Fire! Fire!

1186
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:58,141
What?

1187
00:52:58,208 --> 00:52:59,442
Fire, there!

1188
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:00,644
My God. Stay here.

1189
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:01,754
I have to get your brother.
Don't move.

1190
00:53:01,778 --> 00:53:02,712
OK!

1191
00:53:02,779 --> 00:53:03,713
Stay there, OK?

1192
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:04,648
OK.

1193
00:53:04,714 --> 00:53:05,849
Oh, my God.

1194
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:09,019
Mommy! Mommy!

1195
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:14,024
Mommy, are you OK?

1196
00:53:18,328 --> 00:53:19,572
Molly, come here,
Molly, come here.

1197
00:53:19,596 --> 00:53:20,797
Oh, my God.

1198
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:23,166
Get us out, Mommy, get us out,
get us out, get us out!

1199
00:53:23,233 --> 00:53:25,769
I'm trying, hold on.

1200
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:33,410
Mommy, hurry!

1201
00:53:33,476 --> 00:53:34,711
I know, honey, I'm trying!

1202
00:53:39,015 --> 00:53:41,218
Is there anything there? No.

1203
00:53:41,284 --> 00:53:44,354
It's, it's quarter to 1,

1204
00:53:44,421 --> 00:53:48,491
and Dad has finally let
me do night patrol,

1205
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:50,393
I have...

1206
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:53,964
30 more minutes until Dad takes over.

1207
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:59,269
I've seen an owl, seen a bat.

1208
00:53:59,336 --> 00:54:04,474
It's a little boring, but, I mean,

1209
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:07,043
it's OK.

1210
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:22,225
I think that's all.

1211
00:54:22,292 --> 00:54:23,560
Thanks.

1212
00:54:23,627 --> 00:54:25,462
Let's keep this between the two of us.

1213
00:54:25,528 --> 00:54:27,264
Yeah, thanks, thanks a lot.

1214
00:54:29,032 --> 00:54:30,467
Aw!

1215
00:54:31,801 --> 00:54:35,372
Jason, I got it all on film.

1216
00:54:38,908 --> 00:54:40,977
Dad's gonna kill him.

1217
00:54:44,314 --> 00:54:45,448
Out of here!

1218
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:51,321
I'm trying to open it!

1219
00:54:53,156 --> 00:54:53,990
Mommy!

1220
00:54:54,057 --> 00:54:56,626
Come on, come on, out!
Get out, get out, go!

1221
00:55:08,104 --> 00:55:10,240
Are you OK?

1222
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:14,110
Mommy, I'm sorry. I did it, I'm sorry.

1223
00:55:14,177 --> 00:55:16,012
All that matters is that you're OK.

1224
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:17,614
OK.

1225
00:55:20,183 --> 00:55:22,023
We got to get your brother
to the hospital, OK?

1226
00:55:22,085 --> 00:55:23,186
OK.

1227
00:55:23,253 --> 00:55:25,655
OK. OK, Molly,
I need you to stay right here, OK?

1228
00:55:25,722 --> 00:55:26,790
OK.

1229
00:55:26,856 --> 00:55:28,591
Stop, please!

1230
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:30,160
Stop!

1231
00:55:33,897 --> 00:55:37,000
My baby, my house,
I got to get to the hospital really fast.

1232
00:55:37,067 --> 00:55:38,902
Molly, come on, get in the car.

1233
00:55:38,968 --> 00:55:40,737
We got to go! We got to go!

1234
00:55:40,804 --> 00:55:42,048
We got to get the baby
to the hospital.

1235
00:55:42,072 --> 00:55:43,306
What about Daddy?

1236
00:55:43,373 --> 00:55:44,933
He's gonna find us, baby. We got to go.

1237
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:47,877
Are you sure he'll find us?

1238
00:55:47,944 --> 00:55:49,045
Baby, he'll find us, OK?

1239
00:55:49,112 --> 00:55:51,181
We got to go. Your brother's
really sick right now.

1240
00:55:53,983 --> 00:55:55,151
<i>Here at KMY-FM,</i>

1241
00:55:55,218 --> 00:55:56,495
<i>we've heard that hundreds
of house fires</i>

1242
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:59,823
<i>are burning out of control
across the region tonight.</i>

1243
00:55:59,889 --> 00:56:02,992
<i>Candles, gas stoves,
and home generators</i>

1244
00:56:03,059 --> 00:56:04,661
<i>have all caused accidents,</i>

1245
00:56:04,728 --> 00:56:07,230
<i>which fire chiefs say they are
unable to bring under control</i>

1246
00:56:07,297 --> 00:56:10,500
<i>due to the ongoing problems
with the water supply.</i>

1247
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:20,753
<i>EMTs and hospital staff have
been working round the clock</i>

1248
00:56:20,777 --> 00:56:22,846
<i>to deal with the number of casualties,</i>

1249
00:56:22,912 --> 00:56:26,783
<i>but with reports that the city morgue
no longer has a working generator,</i>

1250
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:30,053
<i>the question for authorities now is
what will happen to the dead</i>

1251
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:33,523
<i>as the blackout body count
continues to rise?</i>

1252
00:56:42,165 --> 00:56:48,371
So I've been out all night checking
just about every hospital I can find,

1253
00:56:48,438 --> 00:56:51,374
and there's still no sign of my mom yet.

1254
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:55,178
Hey, you with the camera!

1255
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:58,181
Oh, crap, I got to get out of here!

1256
00:57:02,786 --> 00:57:05,455
Gosh, there are way too many gangs
down here.

1257
00:57:15,899 --> 00:57:18,368
Oh, my God. All right.

1258
00:57:26,075 --> 00:57:27,444
What the...

1259
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:29,412
Police car.

1260
00:57:30,346 --> 00:57:33,349
What, what the hell?

1261
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:38,721
Geez, oh, my God.

1262
00:57:42,859 --> 00:57:48,031
Oh, my God, oh, my God.
Oh, geez. Body bags.

1263
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:51,668
Get the hell out of here.

1264
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:01,411
Shoot.

1265
00:58:04,681 --> 00:58:06,950
Dad, where are you going?

1266
00:58:10,687 --> 00:58:12,822
Dad?

1267
00:58:12,889 --> 00:58:14,357
What are you...

1268
00:58:14,424 --> 00:58:17,393
Jason, did you give some food away
last night?

1269
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:18,795
No.

1270
00:58:18,862 --> 00:58:23,066
Jason, did you give away any food
last night?

1271
00:58:23,132 --> 00:58:24,968
No, sir.

1272
00:58:25,034 --> 00:58:26,836
You're lying to me.

1273
00:58:26,903 --> 00:58:29,239
I know for a fact that you
gave some food away.

1274
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:32,976
Some neighbors did come by.

1275
00:58:33,042 --> 00:58:34,711
Some neighbors came by?

1276
00:58:34,777 --> 00:58:36,212
I didn't give them a lot, though.

1277
00:58:36,279 --> 00:58:38,147
It doesn't matter how much you give them!

1278
00:58:38,214 --> 00:58:39,716
You listen to me!

1279
00:58:39,782 --> 00:58:41,584
If you ever do that again,

1280
00:58:41,651 --> 00:58:44,220
if you ever compromise
my family, the food!

1281
00:58:44,287 --> 00:58:45,698
That's not compromising,
that's helping out.

1282
00:58:45,722 --> 00:58:47,132
It's not helping out, you understand?

1283
00:58:47,156 --> 00:58:48,391
It's hindering us.

1284
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:49,869
Don't you understand what you've done?

1285
00:58:49,893 --> 00:58:52,061
You've compromised not only
the supply of food,

1286
00:58:52,128 --> 00:58:53,263
but now we're gonna have...

1287
00:58:53,329 --> 00:58:54,430
Dad, what's going on?

1288
00:58:54,497 --> 00:58:55,932
Do you have no morals
whatsoever?

1289
00:58:55,999 --> 00:58:57,567
Please, sweetheart, please just...

1290
00:58:57,634 --> 00:58:59,269
What's happening?

1291
00:58:59,335 --> 00:59:01,905
Honey, I've got this
under control, OK?

1292
00:59:01,971 --> 00:59:02,572
What?

1293
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:04,607
Can he, can you just stop?

1294
00:59:04,674 --> 00:59:06,743
No, no, don't turn that off, son,
you keep that on.

1295
00:59:06,809 --> 00:59:09,345
I want proof that I told you, OK?

1296
00:59:09,412 --> 00:59:10,647
Do you want...

1297
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:12,148
Shut your mouth, OK?

1298
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:13,259
Way to be a crappy person
keeping it for ourselves.

1299
00:59:13,283 --> 00:59:14,684
Let me tell you something...

1300
00:59:14,751 --> 00:59:16,119
Dad, calm down!

1301
00:59:16,185 --> 00:59:19,455
If you ever do that again,
I will lock you up, do you understand?

1302
00:59:19,522 --> 00:59:21,624
This is not how this
was supposed to go.

1303
00:59:21,691 --> 00:59:23,826
We have got to stick to the plan, OK?

1304
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:25,228
OK.

1305
00:59:25,295 --> 00:59:27,030
Now we're going to bump it
up to level two.

1306
00:59:27,096 --> 00:59:28,831
Oh, my God.

1307
00:59:45,848 --> 00:59:48,351
This was kind of cool in the beginning.

1308
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:49,662
You know, we threw a lot of parties.

1309
00:59:49,686 --> 00:59:53,156
We had a lot of fun,
but I'm getting tired of it.

1310
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:57,260
<i>This is

<i>Hospitals continue to provide

1317
01:00:20,149 --> 01:00:23,252

<i>unless your condition

1320
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:30,393
Just got back from the hospital.

1321
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:33,396
I was asking around, the guards,

1322
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:36,165
hey, you know, this is
the hospital my mom works at,

1323
01:00:36,232 --> 01:00:38,368
do you know if she's here?

1324
01:00:38,434 --> 01:00:40,436
I want to see her, she's a nurse.

1325
01:00:40,503 --> 01:00:44,374
And they end up kicking me out of there
because they said,

1326
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:49,846
oh, there's only urgent,
urgent cases only in here.

1327
01:00:49,912 --> 01:00:53,216
They told me to go to one
of these Red Cross camps

1328
01:00:53,282 --> 01:00:54,484
or something.

1329
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:57,854
But I feel safer here.

1330
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:02,659
I didn't want to go to anywhere
like that and just...

1331
01:01:02,725 --> 01:01:05,595
I miss my mom so much.

1332
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:08,765

01:01:38,828 --> 01:01:40,830
but it's a...

1345
01:01:40,897 --> 01:01:42,465
it's a mob scene.

1346
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:45,401
I know people say that word all the time,

1347
01:01:45,468 --> 01:01:47,937
but it truly is a mob scene out there.

1348
01:01:48,004 --> 01:01:51,641
I've never been so scared
for my life, ever, ever, ever.

1349
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:58,047
Look at what has become of us.

1350
01:02:04,987 --> 01:02:07,156
Why is nobody helping us?

1351
01:02:13,429 --> 01:02:15,631

01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:42,901
This cop came up to me
and tried to take my camera off me,

1358
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:44,403
like I was some kind of criminal
or something.

1359

I mean, what is this world coming to?

1360

1361
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:50,676
you think that they're
trying to help you,

1362
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:52,068
they're trying to be civil.

1363

Nothing's safe anymore,
I don't even know.

1364

01:06:15,905 --> 01:06:17,306
So what's going on?

1396
01:06:17,373 --> 01:06:19,942
What's going on like outside?

1397
01:06:20,009 --> 01:06:21,243
What?

1398
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:23,079
Outside of here and everything?

1399
01:06:23,145 --> 01:06:25,614
What's happening?

1400
01:06:29,185 --> 01:06:31,020
It's getting worse, son.

1401
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:37,126
People are rioting, looting.

1402
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:44,200
All the food supplies
and the water supplies.

1403
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:50,206
There's people out there
right now that are starving.

1404
01:06:50,272 --> 01:06:53,943
We're going to have to fight
for whatever food

1405
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:56,445
those people out there want to get,

1406
01:06:56,512 --> 01:06:59,815
'cause they didn't prepare like us.

1407
01:07:06,956 --> 01:07:10,826
Jason, you gonna eat your food?

1408
01:07:10,893 --> 01:07:14,497
No, I'm not that hungry.

1409
01:07:15,498 --> 01:07:17,933
You better finish that food, son.

1410
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,869
I don't feel good.

1411
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:21,904
Eat your food!

1412
01:07:21,971 --> 01:07:23,272
What if I throw up?

1413
01:07:23,339 --> 01:07:26,509
Then you'll eat that. I don't care.

1414
01:07:27,376 --> 01:07:29,512
What did I just say?

1415
01:07:29,578 --> 01:07:31,380
I'm not hungry.

1416
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:35,918
Give me that.

1417
01:07:44,493 --> 01:07:48,864
We're still here.
Not much has changed,

1418
01:07:48,931 --> 01:07:53,135
except I made that sweet pigeon trap.

1419
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:59,108
Um, which will definitely work.

1420
01:07:59,175 --> 01:08:03,679
I found this lighter, though.

1421
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:09,418
Oh, and I still have my battery charger.

1422
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:14,990
And we found this guy.

1423
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:22,832
So, well... he's, he's not doing good.

1424
01:08:22,898 --> 01:08:27,369
Then we got rain water,

1425
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:30,940
which is freaking disgusting,

1426
01:08:31,006 --> 01:08:36,879
but you know,
you got to drink, right?

1427
01:08:42,585 --> 01:08:46,255
♪ Oh, Mr. Sun, where did you go? ♪

1428
01:08:46,322 --> 01:08:51,427
♪ Come out to play on this nice day ♪

1429
01:08:51,494 --> 01:08:55,231
So the world ended,
and actually it's probably

1430
01:08:55,297 --> 01:08:59,201
the first time in a really long while
that I have been this at peace.

1431
01:08:59,268 --> 01:09:02,338
You see, I, I had debt, I had a lot of it,

1432
01:09:02,404 --> 01:09:07,476
and debt doesn't exist
when society no longer exists,

1433
01:09:07,543 --> 01:09:11,113
so I haven't been getting
any more harassing phone calls

1434
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:12,681
from bill collectors.

1435
01:09:12,748 --> 01:09:16,018
<i>Reports just into us at KMY confirm</i>

1436
01:09:16,085 --> 01:09:18,621
<i>that the President today
made a historic request</i>

1437
01:09:18,687 --> 01:09:20,823
<i>for aid from the international community.</i>

1438
01:09:20,890 --> 01:09:23,826
<i>He said it was humbling to admit
that, without electricity,</i>

1439
01:09:23,893 --> 01:09:26,061
<i>America simply cannot
provide its citizens</i>

1440
01:09:26,128 --> 01:09:29,632
<i>with sufficient fuel, food,
water, or medical supplies</i>

1441
01:09:29,698 --> 01:09:31,834
<i>to keep society afloat.</i>

1442
01:09:32,735 --> 01:09:35,175
<i>He added that he was confident
that the international response</i>

1443
01:09:35,237 --> 01:09:36,448
<i>would be both generous and swift,</i>

1444
01:09:36,472 --> 01:09:38,807
<i>and that the assistance would arrive</i>

1445
01:09:38,874 --> 01:09:42,077
<i>before these vital resources
completely run out.</i>

1446
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:52,821
See these batteries?

1447
01:09:52,888 --> 01:09:56,258
These are my last two batteries
for my camera.

1448
01:09:58,294 --> 01:10:00,663
Mommy, is baby Jack OK?

1449
01:10:00,729 --> 01:10:03,132
Baby, he's going to be just fine,
all right?

1450
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:05,000
But I need you to be strong for me, OK?

1451
01:10:05,067 --> 01:10:06,067
OK.

1452
01:10:06,101 --> 01:10:07,245
Do you know how much I love you?

1453
01:10:07,269 --> 01:10:07,937
- Mm-hmm.
- Come here.

1454
01:10:08,003 --> 01:10:10,806
These people aren't very well.

1455
01:10:18,147 --> 01:10:20,349
There's one of the lights that's working.

1456
01:10:20,416 --> 01:10:23,052
A doctor told me there are generators,

1457
01:10:23,118 --> 01:10:27,990
but the generators run on fuel,
and there's not much fuel left.

1458
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:34,630
Where are you, Daddy, and when
are you going to come to get us?

1459
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:46,742
To the parents of Lance...

1460
01:10:51,313 --> 01:10:53,916
I won't ever meet you,

1461
01:10:53,983 --> 01:11:00,656
you won't ever know me,
but I knew your son.

1462
01:11:04,226 --> 01:11:07,463
He was,
he was one of the good ones.

1463
01:11:09,131 --> 01:11:12,134
We wouldn't be here if it wasn't for him.

1464
01:11:15,671 --> 01:11:18,874
OK, so
there's the moon right there.

1465
01:11:20,175 --> 01:11:23,012
There we go, there's the fence,

1466
01:11:23,078 --> 01:11:26,682
and yeah...

1467
01:11:44,099 --> 01:11:46,101
There's two of them.

1468
01:11:46,168 --> 01:11:50,873
Oh, God, oh, God.
Oh I got to go tell Dad.

1469
01:11:50,939 --> 01:11:52,174
Oh, my God!

1470
01:11:52,241 --> 01:11:54,510
Quiet! Quiet!

1471
01:11:54,576 --> 01:11:58,647
Take us to the food,
and you won't get hurt.

1472
01:11:58,714 --> 01:12:00,616
Turn that thing off!

1473
01:12:00,683 --> 01:12:01,950
OK.

1474
01:12:12,227 --> 01:12:14,129
Go in.

1475
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:20,803
Where's it at? Where's it at?

1476
01:12:20,869 --> 01:12:22,304
This way.

1477
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:28,677
It's in there.

1478
01:12:43,759 --> 01:12:47,730
It's been eight days since Mom left,

1479
01:12:47,796 --> 01:12:50,866
and I haven't heard from her since.

1480
01:12:53,001 --> 01:12:57,639
I've noticed lately there's,
there's been a lot more people outside.

1481
01:12:58,607 --> 01:13:03,011
I'm never, never going outside again.

1482
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:07,015
Dad, Dad. Somebody just...

1483
01:13:07,082 --> 01:13:08,217
What?

1484
01:13:08,283 --> 01:13:09,518
Somebody just broke in.

1485
01:13:09,585 --> 01:13:10,585
- What?
- What?

1486
01:13:10,619 --> 01:13:11,854
Yes.

1487
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:12,855
- Somebody just broke in?
- Yes.

1488
01:13:12,921 --> 01:13:13,922
OK.

1489
01:13:13,989 --> 01:13:14,990
They wanted our food.

1490
01:13:15,057 --> 01:13:16,368
Go wake up your sister and Jason.

1491
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:17,426
OK.

1492
01:13:17,493 --> 01:13:18,636
We're going down to the bunker.

1493
01:13:18,660 --> 01:13:20,095
We're going down in the bunker.

1494
01:13:20,162 --> 01:13:21,497
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1495
01:13:21,563 --> 01:13:22,807
It's OK. Are they still in the house?

1496
01:13:22,831 --> 01:13:23,975
No, I don't, no, I don't think so.

1497
01:13:23,999 --> 01:13:27,536
Cheryl, Cheryl, wake up!

1498
01:13:27,603 --> 01:13:29,471
OK, OK, I'm waking up!

1499
01:13:29,538 --> 01:13:30,606
Jason, come on.

1500
01:13:30,672 --> 01:13:32,174
Dad wants you to wake up.

1501
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:34,209
Come on.

1502
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:39,882
Are they still in the house, son?

1503
01:13:39,948 --> 01:13:42,418
No, I don't think so. They, they held me.

1504
01:13:42,484 --> 01:13:44,319
OK, follow me, OK?

1505
01:13:44,386 --> 01:13:45,287
OK.

1506
01:13:45,354 --> 01:13:48,390
Careful, Hank.

1507
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:51,336
But you don't know
if they're in the house?

1508
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:52,761
I, I thought they left.

1509
01:13:52,828 --> 01:13:55,230
They held me until they got all the food.

1510
01:13:55,297 --> 01:13:56,432
Are you OK?

1511
01:13:56,498 --> 01:13:58,534
Yeah, they didn't hurt me.

1512
01:14:00,469 --> 01:14:02,805
How many were there?

1513
01:14:02,871 --> 01:14:05,974
I don't know, like two, three.

1514
01:14:07,176 --> 01:14:08,811
Shh.

1515
01:14:09,711 --> 01:14:11,947
They took all of our stuff.

1516
01:14:12,014 --> 01:14:13,649
I'm sorry.

1517
01:14:13,715 --> 01:14:16,819
OK, all right.
Get in the bunker right away, OK?

1518
01:14:16,885 --> 01:14:19,054
Cheryl, Jason!

1519
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:20,322
Come on.

1520
01:14:20,389 --> 01:14:21,390
Come on, get down here,

1521
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:22,658
we're going to the bunker now!

1522
01:14:22,724 --> 01:14:23,826
OK!

1523
01:14:23,892 --> 01:14:24,993
Let's go!

1524
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:26,695
Coming.

1525
01:14:26,762 --> 01:14:28,397
Now!

1526
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:30,933
OK.

1527
01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:36,271
You guys get down there.

1528
01:14:36,338 --> 01:14:39,074
All right, all right.

1529
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:42,110
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go, let's go.

1530
01:14:42,177 --> 01:14:44,413
Watch your step here.
I've got the light.

1531
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:45,480
OK.

1532
01:14:54,756 --> 01:14:56,191
Hurry.

1533
01:14:57,459 --> 01:14:59,161
Come on.

1534
01:14:59,228 --> 01:15:01,363
Son, I need you to get in the bunker.

1535
01:15:01,430 --> 01:15:02,564
I know.

1536
01:15:02,631 --> 01:15:04,111
Let me know
when they're all in there.

1537
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:05,100
OK.

1538
01:15:05,167 --> 01:15:06,301
Get hunkered down, OK?

1539
01:15:06,368 --> 01:15:07,669
All right.

1540
01:15:12,407 --> 01:15:13,842
Need a light?

1541
01:15:13,909 --> 01:15:16,078
Do we have light? OK.

1542
01:15:22,451 --> 01:15:23,919
Well, now what?

1543
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:28,023
Now we just wait.

1544
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:35,297
Luckily, I still got light on this camera.

1545
01:15:36,098 --> 01:15:39,368
Been saving the battery
ever since the...

1546
01:15:39,434 --> 01:15:43,739
It's been about a week and a half
since we had power.

1547
01:15:43,805 --> 01:15:48,343
We're all, we're all worried
about what's gonna happen next.

1548
01:15:52,314 --> 01:15:53,882

will put their shattered lives</i>

1569
01:16:49,938 --> 01:16:53,475
<i>and separated families
back together again...</i>

1570
01:16:54,876 --> 01:17:01,483
We've been at the,
the Red Cross campsite

1571
01:17:01,550 --> 01:17:04,953
for a whole night.

1572
01:17:07,589 --> 01:17:10,626
It's different and scary.

1573
01:17:14,896 --> 01:17:18,734
A lot of people, a lot of strangers.

1574
01:17:21,236 --> 01:17:22,638
What are you doing?

1575
01:17:22,704 --> 01:17:24,406
Baby, I'm going to see
if we can't find out

1576
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:25,907
about some food and water, OK?

1577
01:17:25,974 --> 01:17:26,974
OK.

1578
01:17:28,210 --> 01:17:29,544
Elizabeth.

1579
01:17:32,914 --> 01:17:36,852
OK, I mean, I don't have a picture.

1580
01:17:36,918 --> 01:17:40,522
I don't really know,
I don't really know what to do.

1581
01:17:40,589 --> 01:17:44,192
He's 35, he has brown hair.

1582
01:17:46,328 --> 01:17:49,798
Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!

1583
01:17:49,865 --> 01:17:52,634
Mommy, look!

1584
01:17:56,004 --> 01:17:58,306
Mommy, look, Daddy's here,
he put our picture up.

1585
01:17:58,373 --> 01:18:00,275
Mommy, Daddy's here, Daddy's here!

1586
01:18:00,342 --> 01:18:02,110
He's here, he's here, Mommy!

1587
01:18:02,177 --> 01:18:03,688
He's here, Mommy!
He's here! He is here!

1588
01:18:03,712 --> 01:18:05,947
Mommy he put, he put.

1589
01:18:06,014 --> 01:18:08,316
Molly, Molly, I need you to stop.

1590
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:10,552
It doesn't mean that he's here, OK?

1591
01:18:10,619 --> 01:18:12,988
It just means he might
have been here. All right?

1592
01:18:13,055 --> 01:18:14,156
OK.

1593
01:18:14,222 --> 01:18:16,158
Take a deep breath,
we're gonna go ask.

1594
01:18:17,225 --> 01:18:23,899
OK, so welcome to my bunker video.

1595
01:18:25,467 --> 01:18:28,737
There's Cheryl, and there's Jason.

1596
01:18:28,804 --> 01:18:33,475
Playing some odd game.

1597
01:18:33,542 --> 01:18:37,345
Been down here for about
two days now, so, yeah.

1598
01:18:37,412 --> 01:18:39,314
There's Mom.

1599
01:18:39,381 --> 01:18:42,284
You still, you still reading that book?

1600
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:44,553
Yep. Look.

1601
01:18:45,454 --> 01:18:48,657
Dad, what are you doing?

1602
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:50,125
Uh...

1603
01:18:50,192 --> 01:18:52,594
What's happening?

1604
01:18:52,661 --> 01:18:56,131
No, no, no. We've got some
people out on the compound.

1605
01:18:56,198 --> 01:18:57,666
- What?
- What?

1606
01:18:59,434 --> 01:19:03,205
No. One, two, one, two...

1607
01:19:03,271 --> 01:19:05,140
I don't believe it.

1608
01:19:05,207 --> 01:19:08,944
No. OK, all right,
that's too many people.

1609
01:19:09,010 --> 01:19:11,646
That's too many people,
so we got people.

1610
01:19:11,713 --> 01:19:13,381
Oh, shoot!

1611
01:19:13,448 --> 01:19:14,883
They've discovered the fuel.

1612
01:19:14,950 --> 01:19:18,754
What? What's going on?

1613
01:19:18,820 --> 01:19:20,455
Man.

1614
01:19:20,522 --> 01:19:22,724
That's gonna cripple us,
that is gonna cripple us.

1615
01:19:22,791 --> 01:19:24,402
- What's going on?
- No, I don't believe it.

1616
01:19:24,426 --> 01:19:26,728
Look how many people
there are out there.

1617
01:19:26,795 --> 01:19:28,096
What are we gonna do?

1618
01:19:28,163 --> 01:19:29,097
We got to stop them,

1619
01:19:29,164 --> 01:19:30,174
'cause if they, they come back for that,

1620
01:19:30,198 --> 01:19:31,309
they're gonna come back for more.

1621
01:19:31,333 --> 01:19:32,573
They're gonna keep coming back.

1622
01:19:32,634 --> 01:19:34,302
OK, I got to go out there.

1623
01:19:34,369 --> 01:19:35,370
No.

1624
01:19:35,437 --> 01:19:36,547
No, no, you guys just stay here, OK?

1625
01:19:36,571 --> 01:19:38,340
Dad. No. Please?

1626
01:19:38,406 --> 01:19:40,542
I don't want you
going out there. No.

1627
01:19:41,643 --> 01:19:44,012
Don't worry about me, OK?

1628
01:19:45,413 --> 01:19:48,250
We'll lose everything
if I don't stop them right now.

1629
01:19:48,316 --> 01:19:50,076
They've got to know
that they can't get away.

1630
01:19:50,118 --> 01:19:51,358
How are you going to stop them?

1631
01:19:51,386 --> 01:19:52,420
What are you going to do?

1632
01:19:52,487 --> 01:19:53,722
What can you... Dad?

1633
01:19:53,789 --> 01:19:55,090
Now they're coming back, see?

1634
01:19:55,157 --> 01:19:56,437
I don't want you to go up there.

1635
01:19:56,491 --> 01:19:58,059
Why are you doing this?

1636
01:19:58,126 --> 01:19:59,394
You guys stay here.

1637
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:02,264
Dad, Dad, come on, no, don't.

1638
01:20:02,330 --> 01:20:03,732
Why?

1639
01:20:03,799 --> 01:20:05,109
Please, can you go
back over to the table?

1640
01:20:05,133 --> 01:20:06,573
No, I don't want you to go up there.

1641
01:20:06,601 --> 01:20:07,769
Dad?

1642
01:20:07,836 --> 01:20:08,880
I want you to go back to the table, OK?

1643
01:20:08,904 --> 01:20:10,305
Honey, please?

1644
01:20:10,372 --> 01:20:11,673
It's too risky.

1645
01:20:11,740 --> 01:20:13,708
- It's not.
- No.

1646
01:20:13,775 --> 01:20:14,843
Honey...

1647
01:20:14,910 --> 01:20:15,920
What if you don't come back?

1648
01:20:15,944 --> 01:20:17,712
I'll be back, OK?

1649
01:20:17,779 --> 01:20:19,181
I don't want you to go up there.

1650
01:20:19,247 --> 01:20:20,558
Just go back there.
I'll be back. Don't worry, OK?

1651
01:20:20,582 --> 01:20:21,917
I'm not sure about that.

1652
01:20:21,983 --> 01:20:23,451
Hank!

1653
01:20:23,518 --> 01:20:24,953
Just stay down here, OK?

1654
01:20:34,229 --> 01:20:36,298
What is that?

1655
01:20:56,117 --> 01:20:58,920
I think it's coming from the basement.

1656
01:21:46,134 --> 01:21:47,969
OK.

1657
01:21:59,614 --> 01:22:01,049
What are we gonna do?

1658
01:22:01,116 --> 01:22:02,584
He can't just be up there.

1659
01:22:02,651 --> 01:22:05,887
Well, we just stay put like Dad said.

1660
01:22:05,954 --> 01:22:07,756
Just, just wait.

1661
01:22:07,822 --> 01:22:10,158
No, no! Where is he?

1662
01:22:10,225 --> 01:22:12,227
Just wait.

1663
01:22:12,294 --> 01:22:13,662
What are we gonna do?

1664
01:22:13,728 --> 01:22:15,196
We're not going to do anything.

1665
01:22:15,263 --> 01:22:16,698
Dad's up there.

1666
01:22:16,765 --> 01:22:19,601
He already, wait. Where is he?

1667
01:22:21,503 --> 01:22:22,837
There he is, OK?

1668
01:22:22,904 --> 01:22:26,241
There he is. Wait, wait.

1669
01:22:26,308 --> 01:22:28,243
Oh! Who has him?

1670
01:22:28,310 --> 01:22:29,311
Oh, my God.

1671
01:22:29,377 --> 01:22:30,211
What's happening?

1672
01:22:30,278 --> 01:22:31,980
Somebody has him with a knife.

1673
01:22:32,047 --> 01:22:32,948
He's gonna get killed.

1674
01:22:33,014 --> 01:22:34,316
Quiet!

1675
01:22:34,983 --> 01:22:36,251
I'm going.

1676
01:22:36,318 --> 01:22:37,719
What?

1677
01:22:37,786 --> 01:22:39,706
Jason, do you even know
what to do with that gun?

1678
01:22:39,754 --> 01:22:41,022
Yes.

1679
01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:46,494
Come on, baby,
we got to get some water.

1680
01:22:54,169 --> 01:22:55,770
We need some water, too.

1681
01:22:55,837 --> 01:22:57,706
Hold on. No. sir, hold on.

1682
01:22:57,772 --> 01:22:59,074
Please, sir, get back!

1683
01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:00,642
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1684
01:23:05,113 --> 01:23:07,983
Mommy! Mommy!

1685
01:23:08,049 --> 01:23:10,552
Mommy! Mommy!

1686
01:23:18,426 --> 01:23:19,828
Molly?

1687
01:23:19,894 --> 01:23:22,964
Molly? Molly?

1688
01:23:24,332 --> 01:23:27,168
Molly? Molly!

1689
01:23:28,003 --> 01:23:29,170
Molly!

1690
01:23:29,237 --> 01:23:30,781
Have you seen my daughter?
Have you seen my daughter?

1691
01:23:30,805 --> 01:23:32,774
She's eight, she has red hair, please?

1692
01:23:32,841 --> 01:23:34,576
Please, have you seen my daughter?

1693
01:23:34,642 --> 01:23:37,545
Have you seen my daughter?
She's eight, she has red hair.

1694
01:23:37,612 --> 01:23:39,114
Please. Molly!

1695
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:40,882
Please.

1696
01:23:44,786 --> 01:23:46,388
Put the knife down.

1697
01:23:46,454 --> 01:23:47,589
No.

1698
01:23:47,655 --> 01:23:48,757
Jason, son.

1699
01:23:48,823 --> 01:23:50,258
Put down the knife.

1700
01:23:50,325 --> 01:23:53,328
Jason, son, what are you doing?

1701
01:23:59,667 --> 01:24:02,037
If you guys wanted food,
you should have prepared, OK?

1702
01:24:02,103 --> 01:24:04,572
Take it easy, son.
I don't want to hurt him.

1703
01:24:04,639 --> 01:24:07,675
Jason, let them have whatever they want.

1704
01:24:07,742 --> 01:24:09,110
There's too many of them.

1705
01:24:19,287 --> 01:24:22,123
If you don't put the knife down
in three seconds,

1706
01:24:22,190 --> 01:24:24,092
I will shoot you.

1707
01:25:01,496 --> 01:25:03,198
Who's there?

1708
01:25:03,998 --> 01:25:05,834
I have a gun.

1709
01:25:14,042 --> 01:25:15,543
What the heck?

1710
01:25:24,085 --> 01:25:25,653
Victor?

1711
01:25:27,288 --> 01:25:29,290
Mom?

1712
01:25:29,357 --> 01:25:30,625
Oh, God!

1713
01:25:45,807 --> 01:25:46,941
Mom?

1714
01:25:51,212 --> 01:25:52,212
What?

1715
01:25:55,617 --> 01:25:57,285
The power's back on.

1716
01:25:57,352 --> 01:25:59,821
Thank God!

1717
01:26:05,093 --> 01:26:06,928
- Hank?
- Jason?

1718
01:26:06,995 --> 01:26:08,062
Hank!

1719
01:26:09,164 --> 01:26:11,199
Sarah. It's all over.

1720
01:26:13,101 --> 01:26:14,469
Mom...

1721
01:26:14,536 --> 01:26:16,171
Mom, I'm all right.

1722
01:26:17,672 --> 01:26:19,707
I'll call you later, I swear.

1723
01:26:19,774 --> 01:26:20,942
We're gonna be OK.

1724
01:26:21,009 --> 01:26:22,977
I love you.

1725
01:26:23,044 --> 01:26:24,612
Hank!

1726
01:26:26,714 --> 01:26:28,850
We're gonna be all right.

1727
01:26:30,418 --> 01:26:32,220
Oh, God.

1728
01:26:35,557 --> 01:26:37,625
Mommy!

1729
01:26:37,692 --> 01:26:39,160
Molly?

1730
01:26:39,227 --> 01:26:41,129
Steven? Steven!

1731
01:26:41,196 --> 01:26:43,498
Molly!

1732
01:26:51,906 --> 01:26:54,142
Matt! Matt!

1733
01:26:54,209 --> 01:26:57,445
Matt, you got to come see this.

1734
01:26:58,980 --> 01:27:01,049
Come here, come on!

1735
01:27:01,115 --> 01:27:02,483
OK.

1736
01:27:02,550 --> 01:27:04,085
You're gonna want to film this.

1737
01:27:04,152 --> 01:27:07,789
OK. OK. OK.

1738
01:27:11,626 --> 01:27:13,995
The lights are coming back on.

1739
01:27:14,062 --> 01:27:17,899
They're on. They're on!

1740
01:27:17,966 --> 01:27:20,201
They're actually on.

1741
01:27:22,503 --> 01:27:26,174
I've got service! I've got service!

1742
01:27:31,179 --> 01:27:32,680
Hello.

1743
01:27:32,747 --> 01:27:35,416
Yeah, yeah.

1744
01:27:36,584 --> 01:27:38,019
There were four of us.

1745
01:27:39,687 --> 01:27:41,389
Yeah.

1746
01:27:41,456 --> 01:27:42,857
