1
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,075
Come on.

2
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,959
Good, lad.

3
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,070
Good, mate.

4
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,673
Come on, lads.

5
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,350
Sandra.

6
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,879
I'll see you at 11.

7
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,237
Morning, bike.

8
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,954
Stay.

9
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,031
Stay.

10
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,309
How are you, Geoff?

11
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,233
Not bad, Col.
How's business?

12
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,833
Booming.

13
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,035
Pretty good game last night.

14
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,589
Play like that, we’ll be
in the Premier next season.

15
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,318
Yeah.

16
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,756
Zippy had a cracking game.

17
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,753
Treble 19, 10, and double 16.

18
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,114
Calm as a dead horse.

19
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,077
You did alright.

20
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,912
Not bad.

21
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,355
So, sorted out the travel plans?

22
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,511
Next couple of days.

23
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,437
Blackpool.

24
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,919
Athletic Arms on tour.

25
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,750
Deno was saying that Bristow's
got arthritis again.

26
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,830
Has he heck.

27
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,240
That's what I said.

28
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,438
It's 'cause his missus
isn't lettin' him go, you know.

29
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,872
"Deno, it's 'cause your missus
isn't lettin' you go."

30
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,309
Right.

31
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,076
Oh, I'll catch you later, Col.

32
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,319
I'll be ordering
your darts after.

33
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,553
Oh, hello.

34
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,917
Yes, do you stock
the Power Point Darts?

35
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,958
Have you got 26 grams?

36
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,680
Oh. 23?

37
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,037
- Alright, Sandra?
- Not bad.

38
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,838
- Alright, Sandra?
- Not bad.

39
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,831
- Morning, Sandra.
- Not bad.

40
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,515
Do they have the barrel release
and flight safe as well?

41
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,033
Why aren't you at school?

42
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,430
I'm sick.

43
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,840
What about you?

44
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,355
I'm sick, too.

45
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,192
What about you?

46
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,590
Me?
I'm sick.

47
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,830
Well, get home, then.

48
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,436
Have they got the retractable
in the barrel

49
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,909
when you pull them out?

50
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,433
How was sleep, love?

51
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,477
Fine.

52
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,200
I had to order Geoff
a set of 23s.

53
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,237
He don't use them.
They're too light.

54
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,231
They didn't have
the ones he wanted.

55
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,597
You should have rung him first.
He won't want to pay for 'em.

56
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,196
Alright.

57
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,354
Well, I'll see you later.

58
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,317
See you later.

59
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,669
Six times World Champion.

60
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,717
The greatest player of all time.

61
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,474
If you want to know
about darts, listen to Eric.

62
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,994
Game on!

63
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,229
Hi, I'm Eric Bristow.

64
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,233
I'll give some of my top tips
on how to play better darts.

65
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,438
First we're gonna get your grip
right, then your stance,

66
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,158
then we're gonna use your weight

67
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,754
in the right way
to improve your game.

68
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,879
It's about feeling comfortable.

69
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,395
You must feel comfortable
on the oche.

70
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,869
The way it is
structured and remoulded

71
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,998
are, for the voyeur,
absolutely fantastic.

72
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,639
Right.
Your go.

73
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,155
Picasso says,
"Any act of creation

74
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,959
is an act of destruction."

75
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,031
As soon as you painted
a picture.

76
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,350
It's a bit like painting
your bathroom wall.

77
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,760
It becomes something else.

78
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,958
Is it that easy? No, it just
becomes a different colour.

79
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,078
A little bit further
to your right.

80
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,629
- Where'd that go?
- No, further to your right.

81
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,360
Hang on, Shady.
Give me the dart.

82
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,078
I'll show you how to do it.

83
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,798
- Thank you very much.
- You ready?

84
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,632
Double top.

85
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,834
Where'd it go?

86
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,991
I don't know.

87
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,878
Got ya!

88
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,758
Right.
It's the Blackpool kitty.

89
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,116
- Here we go.
- I'm getting the luxury coach.

90
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,918
I'm gonna put the deposit on it.

91
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,752
I'll give you a fiver now.

92
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,592
I'm getting one
with a video in it.

93
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,239
Nice one.

94
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,197
What about them, you see?

95
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,837
- Can I get you one in, love?
- Go on, then.

96
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,680
Do you want a drink, duck?
Geoff's buying.

97
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,513
Oh, I'll have a pint
of bitter, please.

98
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,830
Right, a pint of bitter.

99
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,070
Please, Monty.

100
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,438
You alright, Bob?

101
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,156
Only halves.

102
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,520
What does he mean
by that, anyway?

103
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,510
Choose right.

104
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,352
Hey, love.

105
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,239
Where'd you spring from?

106
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,116
Evening, lads.

107
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,271
You in good nick tonight, Colin?

108
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,680
Need to be, with this lot.

109
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,036
- Play, do you?
- Not much.

110
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,555
I don't mind watching, though.

111
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,200
My God, it's P.C. Road Tax.

112
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,918
I'm not sitting
in your seat, am I?

113
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,990
Yes, you are.

114
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,673
Dear me.
I am sorry.

115
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,479
I better move on before
I get done for loitering.

116
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,356
Settle down.

117
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,590
Ready for a stuffing
tonight, lads?

118
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,115
Visitors over there.

119
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,279
Nik Nik.

120
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,516
I'd forgotten it was
that little prick.

121
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,069
We gotta beat this lot, lads.

122
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,673
Right, Colin, you're first up.

123
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,513
Let's get this game on.

124
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,593
Hello, hello, hello.

125
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,673
Madam, I will ask you
to come quietly.

126
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,469
- Oh, no, I won't come quietly.
- Madam!

127
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,319
Oh, you bastard!

128
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,199
"The male may be
too old to produce sperm."

129
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,271
Bollocks.

130
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,318
"He may be
genetically sterile.

131
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,189
He may have become sterile
due to damage of his gonads."

132
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,074
"None of these are fixable.

133
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,391
The only solution
is to find another male."

134
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,157
What do you reckon, Geoff?

135
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,515
I want us to be together, Sand.

136
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,558
What are you talking about?

137
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,193
I want us to be together
when we're in Blackpool.

138
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,794
It could be our first trip
together as a couple.

139
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,200
You want me to leave Colin?

140
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:52,352
Colin doesn't have owt
I couldn't give you.

141
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,875
I couldn't keep me hands
off you last night.

142
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,758
I noticed.

143
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,391
Think about walking down
the Golden Mile together,

144
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,154
looking at the illuminations,
seeing the tower.

145
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,120
Hey, we could go see
"Grumbleweeds," couldn't we?

146
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,714
Yeah, we could go
and see the aquarium.

147
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,711
Anything you want.

148
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,878
I do like Blackpool.

149
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,037
There's a look of defeat
on Eric Bristow's face

150
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:31,149
as Colin the Lightning Low
steps onto the oche.

151
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:36,519
These three darts could decide
this year's world championships.

152
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,071
20.
2 darts.

153
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:43,711
He needs 19, and then double 8.

154
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,911
He's got the 19.

155
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,355
The crowd's hushed up.

156
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,397
Bristow shakes his head.

157
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,869
It's too late for that, Eric.

158
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,759
Double 8 for the match.

159
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,276
Oh, bugger.

160
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,354
Where does she keep the change?

161
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,831
See you tomorrow, Geoff.

162
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,911
About 9-ish.

163
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,199
Lights are out.
Give us a kiss.

164
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,391
Neighbors!

165
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,630
Good night.

166
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,950
Good night.

167
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,751
You still up, duck?

168
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,513
I didn't wake you, did I?

169
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,833
No, no.
I were up.

170
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,992
You alright?

171
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,675
What were all that about,
Sandra?

172
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,795
What?

173
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,394
I saw thee.
I saw it.

174
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,153
Saw what?

175
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,517
Yeah, Geoff.

176
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,592
You know what he's like.
He were just sodding about.

177
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:04,275
Don't be daft.
Come on, let's go to bed.

178
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,830
I left in the night, thinking
he were out with his mates.

179
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,756
- What's going on?
- Nothing's going on!

180
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,400
I just got a lift back,
didn't I?

181
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,313
- What's wrong with you?
- I should have bloody known.

182
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,711
The man has his hands on you
all the bloody time.

183
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,313
I thought you'd have brains
to know better than that.

184
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,550
One of me mates?

185
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,199
- The bloody captain!
- Let me...

186
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,749
I just saw that, Sandra!

187
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,151
I saw it.

188
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,430
I've left him.

189
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,951
Geoff and me got to thinking

190
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,953
that we were wanting
to get together.

191
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,557
Yeah, there's two sides
to it, lads.

192
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,278
Me and her, yeah.

193
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,000
We couldn't stop it, like.

194
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,276
But after what she's been
through at home,

195
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,158
that's not right for no lady.

196
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,629
No, no, it needs saying, duck.

197
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,476
If you're saying that our Colin
has been a bad man at home,

198
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,949
then I don't believe that.

199
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,836
He's as calm as cow shit
on the lawn.

200
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,194
Yeah?

201
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,793
Well, it's the truth.

202
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,598
Show 'em your wrist, duck.

203
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,196
Come on. Look at this.
Look at that.

204
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,999
Now, I couldn't stand by
and let something like that

205
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,640
happen to our Sand, could I?

206
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,189
And not do something
about it, could I?

207
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,354
So as captain,
I've made a tough decision.

208
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,115
Colin's off the team.
Shady's in.

209
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,670
Now, we're gonna concentrate
on tonight's game, are we?

210
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,830
Win this one.

211
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,389
Good warm-up for Blackpool,
isn't it?

212
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,394
Where is he?

213
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,834
I don't know, man.

214
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,991
I'm starving.

215
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,274
Who needs Blackpool?

216
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,080
We’ll have the crack, though,
won't we, Zip?

217
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,910
Always be honest.

218
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,993
You don't live long enough
to be kidding.

219
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,958
You both love Blackpool, Colin.

220
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,589
She's talked about nowt else
for the last three months.

221
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:40,150
Blackpool this
and Blackpool that.

222
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,834
And now she's going.

223
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,515
And you ain't even
gonna bloody go.

224
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,830
What if she don't come back?

225
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,836
You'll look back
in about 30 years.

226
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:59,709
When you stayed home.

227
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,997
And didn't even put up
a bloody fight.

228
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,549
Hey, up.
Anthony and Cleopatra.

229
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,671
- Alright, lads.
- Alright.

230
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,831
- You're always late.
- Hey up, Sand.

231
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,912
All fit for Blackpool, then?

232
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,718
Deno.

233
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,639
I got let down
by the luxury coach, lads.

234
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,599
But at least we won't
get stopped for speeding.

235
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,635
There you go.

236
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,233
To the shirts, will you?

237
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,435
Come on, Deno.

238
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,919
Blackpool, a week?

239
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,399
Haven't even got a video.

240
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,915
- Trevor, you get in the back.
- What?

241
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,877
Don't be scheming.
Get in there.

242
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,315
I can't go in there.
I've got claustrophobia.

243
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,959
Shut up, Trevor.

244
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,519
You ride in style with me, love.

245
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,955
There we go.

246
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,834
Blackpool, here we come.

247
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,113
Good luck.

248
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,796
Take good care of her.

249
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,553
We will.

250
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,759
- See you, then.
- See ya.

251
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,397
Alright.

252
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,355
Hello?

253
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,714
Hello.

254
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,837
- It's me.
- Where are you?

255
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,514
I'm at corner of Wilcox Road,

256
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,160
and I'm just ringing
to say I'm alright.

257
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,719
How's it all back there?

258
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,029
It's alright.

259
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,030
Speak up.

260
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,519
It's alright.

261
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,750
Right. Good.

262
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:03,232
Well, I'll see you soon.
Bye.

263
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,072
See ya.

264
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,236
Alright.

265
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,799
Are you ready to order?

266
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,713
Can I have sausage,
beans, eggs, and chips?

267
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,871
You want mushrooms?

268
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,918
Ah, go on, then.

269
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,911
I'm on the road, love.

270
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,320
Are ya?

271
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,913
I'm off up to Blackpool.

272
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,594
Las Vegas of the North.

273
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,829
Are the portions bigger
than in these pictures?

274
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,274
I don't know.

275
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,556
I'm in the service business
with Sand.

276
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,438
Nothing worse than someone
being rude.

277
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,716
I hate it when they come in
and grunt

278
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,711
and bend the corners
on the magazines

279
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,552
without no intention
of buying them,

280
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,439
and then they're off without
so much as an "alright."

281
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,033
Don't it drive you mad?

282
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,872
Is that everything?

283
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,630
Be about five minutes.

284
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,916
Well, thanks a lot.
I'll see you again.

285
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,958
3, 2, 1 .

286
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,236
Go!

287
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,759
You had a word with them lads
about tearin' up beermats?

288
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,150
You've only had
two in the last hour.

289
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,231
Then help us out a bit, Ron.

290
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:26,073
Work to live, not work to live.

291
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,959
Live to live or work.

292
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,551
Any chance of getting
the leg over tonight?

293
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,917
Nice old helmet you got there.

294
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,832
- Harley?
- Honda.

295
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,990
Gold Wing?

296
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,151
50.

297
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,389
Heading up to Blackpool.

298
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,118
Blackpool.

299
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,157
I've had some mucky times
over there.

300
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,958
Bloody hell I have.

301
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:14,351
Nearly got meself into
a "mensch à la trois" once.

302
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:17,114
Las Vegas of the North,
it's like.

303
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,116
Wouldn't happen to have
a nice local beer?

304
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,591
It's funny you should say that.
Got one of me own concoctions.

305
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,990
Wicked Weasel, Mark IV.

306
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,036
Mark IV?

307
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,316
It's from a good line
of prototypes.

308
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,834
Wouldn't bother if I were you.

309
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,116
Shut it, Mandy.
I've had no complaints yet.

310
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,952
That's 'cause
you hadn't sold any.

311
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,759
A new product
needs time to find its market.

312
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,036
£2.40.

313
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,433
Alright.

314
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,675
You're not supposed to sit
on that swing. It's broken.

315
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,115
Not a-bloody-gain, Ebony.

316
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,918
Why do you have to tamper
with the bloody swings?

317
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,274
I haven't done anything.

318
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,794
- I'm alright.
-It's not bloody on this!

319
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,156
You're gonna bankrupt me.
Some bugger'll sue us.

320
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,197
No, it just broke.

321
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,237
Things don't
bloody break willy-nilly.

322
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,312
Hands tamper with the objects
that feed. Go on. Inside.

323
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,993
- No.
- I won't tell you twice.

324
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,594
You want me to get
your mum out here?

325
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,956
Could you do us a refill?

326
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,598
Smell that.

327
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,398
Sorry, mate,
I can't drink that.

328
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,869
I don't know. It's off.
I'll have a bottle.

329
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,792
- A bottle?
- Yeah.

330
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,790
He drank it.

331
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:17,191
There's nowt wrong with me
Wicked Weasel, is there, lad?

332
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,789
No, no, I'll have a bottle.

333
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,916
Do you want a game, mate?

334
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,469
If you want to, yeah.

335
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,437
Yeah?

336
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,318
Go on, Ian.

337
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,831
My name's Ian.

338
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,876
Colin.
Me mates call me "Col."

339
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,029
There you go.

340
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,316
Cheers.

341
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,960
I had Eric Bristow
in here last year.

342
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,873
Played a game
on this very board.

343
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,236
- On this one?
- Yeah.

344
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,917
Me and Eric.

345
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,276
- Eric Bristow.
- Yeah.

346
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:19,034
- Beat him and all. Nearly did.
- No, he didn't.

347
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,794
If you've nothing better to do,
sort out that daughter of yours.

348
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,837
She's causing carnage
in the car park.

349
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,991
Is he still alive?

350
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,991
Of course he's still alive.

351
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,390
Six times World Champion.
Bristow.

352
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,154
Six times World Champion
at darts, though.

353
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,073
Sarah, you don't understand
darts, so don't start now.

354
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:39,278
- How many ends you want to play?
- It's legs.

355
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,475
It's ends.

356
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,154
No, Ian, it's legs.

357
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,469
Is it?

358
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:47,871
Don't laugh.
Alright. Come on.

359
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,551
Aw, shit.
You alright? I'm sorry.

360
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,472
Sorry, sorry.

361
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,871
- It's just a scratch.
- I didn't mean to do that.

362
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,519
- I didn't mean to do that.
- I know you didn't.

363
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,671
I was only playing.

364
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,474
"One driver, kidding himself
he was heading north,

365
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,279
covered hundreds
of miles of the M25.

366
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:15,513
Stopped to ask the police
the directions to Durham.

367
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,594
And discovered he was only 15
miles from his home in Kent."

368
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,876
"Another en route from
Lancashire to Middlesex

369
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,234
pulled into an M25 lay-by

370
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,392
in a state of glassy-eyed
confusion almost two days later.

371
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,633
He'd been around once too often
and was temporarily witless."

372
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,718
Alright, Colin.

373
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,034
Sorry.

374
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,952
She trying it on, Col?

375
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,714
No, I was just erecting me tent.

376
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,360
Oh, look, Ian,
you've embarrassed him now.

377
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,760
You're the one
flashing your tits.

378
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,750
No, wasn't doing it.

379
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,356
It was just me getting a gaze
in, is all, going for me pegs.

380
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,556
Mate, can I ask you
a personal question?

381
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,676
When did you last have it cut?

382
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,509
I can't remember.

383
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,155
I used to cut my brother's hair.

384
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,880
He was like you.
He had loads of it.

385
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:25,356
Did you know there's some
folk music on tonight, Colin?

386
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,192
Do you like folk?

387
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,712
Me and Sandra don't really
listen to music.

388
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,869
More into the telly, really.

389
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,349
That Bobby Davro's me favourite.

390
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,991
He's oh-so cheeky.

391
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,120
A little bit of a tit,
though, isn't he?

392
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,637
There you go.

393
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,673
Your wife's gonna
love that, mate.

394
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,397
There you go.

395
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,276
What's this?

396
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,953
Finishing touches.

397
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,189
Stick it on.

398
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,559
For those of you
feeling peckish,

399
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,632
there are hot pies
available at the bar.

400
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,711
And could I just ask people

401
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,030
to please stop pissing
in the car park?

402
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,793
Kindly use the urinals provided.

403
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,679
Ladies and gentlemen,
Kate Rusby.

404
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,191
I wouldn't clap yet.
You've not heard the songs.

405
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:46,910
This first one is a song called
"The Fairest of All Yarrow."

406
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:58,199
You look different.

407
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,476
It's the hair.

408
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,233
How much?

409
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,994
Oh, you're alright.
He's not looking.

410
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,640
Thanks very much.

411
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,472
She with you, is she?

412
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,597
Yeah.

413
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,637
Hello!

414
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,989
How's it feel?
You itch?

415
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,356
It's a little bit itchy.
Yeah.

416
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,999
It looks good though, mate.

417
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,354
Yeah.

418
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:15,158
Thank you very much indeed.
You're kind of quiet tonight.

419
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:18,870
It's 'cause you're in awe of me
with me glamourous skirt.

420
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,237
Anyway, this next song
we're gonna do is a song called

421
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,790
"I Wonder What Is Keeping
My True Love This Night."

422
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:49,274
<i>I wonder what is keeping
my true love this night</i>

423
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:57,518
<i>I wonder what is keeping him
out of my sight</i>

424
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:05,189
<i>I wonder if he knows
of the pain I endure</i>

425
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:13,677
<i>And stays from me
this night I’m not sure</i>

426
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:22,032
<i>Oh, love, are you coming,
your cause to advance?</i>

427
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:30,073
<i>Or yet are you waiting
for a far, far better chance?</i>

428
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:38,193
<i>Are you coming for to tell me
you've a new love in store?</i>

429
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:42,831
<i>Or are you coming for
to tell me</i>

430
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:46,311
<i>You love me no more?</i>

431
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,471
Who's the mystery woman?

432
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,212
It's me wife.

433
00:35:53,022 --> 00:35:54,036
Sandra.

434
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,834
I'm off up to see her
in Blackpool.

435
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,231
She's gonna be surprised
when she sees you.

436
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,038
Probably.

437
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,510
So Cliff Lazarenko
needed double top for the match.

438
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:28,753
And Eric needed 134, right?

439
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,353
And he got it?

440
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,031
But it were the way
he went about it.

441
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,838
Yeah, but he got it?

442
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,592
He got it.

443
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,910
Sarah, let the man
tell his story.

444
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,957
Ian, it's another
darts anecdote, though.

445
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,075
So?

446
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,912
Give him a cup.

447
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,913
Ah, bugger. Sarah's right.
It's boring.

448
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,600
No more dart stories.

449
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,918
God knows what
I'll talk about now, then.

450
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,875
Have I showed you
me toothbrush trick?

451
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,870
No.

452
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,837
Watch this.

453
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,793
- What's his toothbrush trick?
- I don't know.

454
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,553
He's off to surprise
his wife in Blackpool.

455
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,756
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

456
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,518
You've never surprised me.

457
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:31,558
Why don't you surprise me?

458
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,358
Oh, don't start.

459
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,953
Alright.

460
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:45,554
This trick was shown to me
by my very good friend Craig.

461
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,034
That's great.
Straight in the fire.

462
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,353
Yeah.

463
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,754
Have you got another one?

464
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,353
No.

465
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:15,432
If it was poetry,
it just wouldn't stand.

466
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,957
He tried all the time
to write the last line.

467
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,236
But he put too many words
in the last sentence

468
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,675
to make it work as a poem.

469
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,717
Oh, I've got
to get me head down.

470
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,950
I think I'll join you.

471
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,798
There you go.

472
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,953
Good night, mate.

473
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:10,153
I've had a bloody good night.

474
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,999
You've taken me in lovely.

475
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,518
I feel like Jesus in the barn.

476
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,873
Except I'm not religious.

477
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,996
Bloody hell.

478
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:32,792
"Colin, have a great journey.

479
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,917
See you on the road.

480
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,230
Sarah and Ian."

481
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,277
Isn't that nice?

482
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,431
Hello?

483
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:17,592
Oh, right. Yeah.
Hi.

484
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:21,913
Yeah. Brilliant.
Great.

485
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,640
Yeah, yeah.

486
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,473
When are you coming back, then?

487
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,756
Right. Okay.
Right.

488
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:32,593
Customers!
Gotta go. Bye.

489
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,558
Save the trees!
Save the trees!

490
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:26,109
Trees not rats!

491
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,714
Save the trees!

492
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,950
Save the trees!

493
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,350
Save the trees.

494
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,670
Would you like
a cheese sandwich?

495
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:43,233
I wouldn't say no, actually.
Thank you.

496
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,394
Listen to the trees.

497
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:50,871
Every one of these trees
has a story to tell.

498
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,234
When they built that dam,

499
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:56,233
do you know how many thousands
of trees were killed?

500
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,834
100-year-old homes
to birds and insects.

501
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,877
All washed away.

502
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:07,392
All their stories lost forever.

503
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,109
People say that you can hear the
ghosts of the birds and insects

504
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,111
looking for their lost homes.

505
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,999
Listen.

506
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,874
The spirit of the forest.

507
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,113
I know a story.

508
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,915
There were this woman
with this ring,

509
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,118
and this bloke
that pulled it off her finger.

510
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,237
No, he didn't.
She died.

511
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,118
Or he killed her.
It don't matter.

512
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,669
And he's trying to pull it off,
but he couldn't.

513
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,230
And then all these people
arrived and took her away.

514
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:52,958
And anyway, she were buried.

515
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,236
And this bloke.
He digs her up.

516
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:58,870
And he tries to take it off with
a saw, or a knife or something,

517
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,749
and then does all these things
in there, and then he's at home.

518
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:06,799
And then boo!
No. Bang!

519
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,750
Something like that, anyway.

520
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:16,272
Come on, girls.
Let's move on.

521
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,114
Hello.

522
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:29,474
Excuse.

523
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:32,359
Have you got two 20s
and a 10 for 50P, have you?

524
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:35,671
Throw the lot in.
It’ll double your luck.

525
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,674
Did you make a wish?

526
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:56,829
Are you in charge
of that lot, then?

527
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:59,434
No one's in charge.

528
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,000
Look at you, bike.

529
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,516
Hello!

530
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,560
That were my bike.

531
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:13,917
The girls thought
it needed a bit of colour.

532
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,229
I hope you don't mind.

533
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:16,594
No, no, no.

534
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:22,073
I thought it were
really beautiful.

535
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:52,317
Yeah, but this woman died.

536
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:56,712
But this ring that this bloke
tried to pull off her.

537
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:57,790
No.
No, he didn't.

538
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:59,200
She died.

539
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,759
Or he killed her.

540
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:03,036
It don't matter.

541
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,677
Is this one any good for ya?

542
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,876
Couldn't have done that
without you.

543
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:30,589
I knew the first time I saw her
she was the girl I'd marry.

544
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:32,239
And I did.

545
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,277
Childhood sweethearts.

546
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:36,670
And you've been happy
ever since?

547
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,516
Happy ever since.

548
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,751
Where is she now, then?

549
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:50,794
Blooming heck, I feel like
I'm in a driving lesson.

550
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,279
Sorry.

551
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,589
Her's up in Blackpool
playing bunny rabbit

552
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:06,355
with P.C. bloody
Geoff bloody Atkins.

553
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:14,232
I'm going up to Blackpool
to bring her home.

554
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:23,117
I'll make her happy.

555
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:27,755
I've always made her happy.

556
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:35,151
She wanted a newsagents,
so I got her a newsagents.

557
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:42,389
She wanted her own house,
so I got her her own house.

558
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:46,476
She didn't want kiddies.

559
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:51,150
So we didn't have kiddies.

560
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:56,874
She wanted tropical fish.

561
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:01,159
She had everything she wanted.

562
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:03,914
And now it's all changed.

563
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:08,078
Everything’s changing
all the time, Colin.

564
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:11,836
That's what life is.

565
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:24,029
I best get off.

566
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,158
Yes.

567
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:29,880
Where are you going, Colin?

568
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:32,236
Yeah, where are you
going, Colin?

569
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:33,276
Bye, Colin.

570
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:36,193
- Very nice to have you with us.
- It was good being here.

571
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:37,839
- Bye.
- Cheerio, Colin.

572
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,752
All the best.

573
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:45,314
- Goodbye!
- Drive safely, Colin!

574
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:47,311
Good luck!

575
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,393
Goodbye, Colin!

576
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:56,875
- See ya!
- Goodbye!

577
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:52,072
Aye, aye, it's the Lone Ranger.

578
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:54,959
You still going to Blackpool?

579
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:58,192
So is me, Mandy, and...

580
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:01,274
Hop in.

581
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:03,874
Move over, Ebony, will ya?

582
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:05,997
Will you open that bloody door?

583
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:08,754
You're not me dad.
Don't tell me what to do.

584
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:09,750
I'm sick of you.

585
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:13,037
Mandy, will you have
a word with her?

586
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:25,277
Where's your bike?

587
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:27,397
Bike?

588
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:28,800
Her's dead.

589
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:35,635
Have you ever been
in a Jag before, Colin?

590
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:37,472
No.

591
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:39,597
Beautiful car.

592
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,876
Beautiful car.

593
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:52,511
The missus thinks I've gone

594
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:55,114
to Blackpool on business,
doesn't she, Mand?

595
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:55,996
Yeah.

596
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:59,391
Falls for it every time,
the woman does.

597
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:02,040
Well, you got to get away
now and again, Col.

598
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:04,077
What's the point
of hanging 'round the same woman

599
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:07,278
when there's beauties like Mand
walking about?

600
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:14,038
I gave Mand a job 'cause she's
got a little kid, haven't you?

601
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:15,076
Yeah.

602
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:18,357
You need the money when you're
bringing them up by yourself.

603
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:20,078
Yeah.

604
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:22,720
And a bit of fun and all.

605
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:24,954
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

606
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:28,431
I don't know why some blokes
haven't seen the light, Colin.

607
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:30,511
Folks have just got to get away

608
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:33,638
from their marriage every now
and again, haven't they?

609
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:41,759
Oh, shit.

610
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,758
Ebony, for Christ's sake.

611
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:47,195
Were you pulling faces
at that copper?

612
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:50,591
Jesus.
Not again.

613
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:10,600
I think you'll really like
the tower.

614
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:21,032
You know, when it first opened,
there was a zoo near the top.

615
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:27,957
It had a lion in a small cage.

616
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:32,189
I'm allergic to lions.

617
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:36,913
Are you?

618
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:42,270
Well, that were replaced
by an indoor garden.

619
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:47,036
With waterfalls
and fountains and that.

620
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:49,873
I bet that were boring.

621
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:59,390
Well, now it's an adventure
playground for kiddies.

622
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:03,038
It's called Jungle Jim's.

623
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:07,153
I don't like jungles.

624
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:18,714
What will you do
when you get there?

625
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:26,515
I'm going to see some friends.

626
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:41,512
What's 60 quid split four ways?

627
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:12,271
Blackpool Tower.
Look.

628
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:13,270
Where?

629
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:15,510
There.

630
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:18,319
I can't see it.
Oh. Typical, though, isn't it?

631
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:21,313
Our Mandy will spot a big
erection from 10 mile off.

632
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:23,391
How would you know?

633
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:15,234
It's not what I remember at all.

634
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:18,950
Blackpool hasn't changed.
It's the people that come here.

635
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:20,474
Look at it.

636
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:22,790
Middle England.

637
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:25,315
Knackered.

638
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:26,595
I remember when Blackpool

639
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:30,560
was full of people
who had flair and style.

640
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:33,712
Nowadays it's full of nasty
youths and drunken hen parties.

641
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:35,438
No class.

642
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:36,669
No class.

643
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:40,196
Not the kind of place
for a romantic weekend, then?

644
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:41,759
Perfect, Colin.

645
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:44,195
Well, there's cheap bedrooms,
isn't there?

646
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,594
You can't park here.
It's a disabled space.

647
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:53,717
Just limp when you get out,
you daft cow.

648
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:55,154
Don't call her a daft cow.

649
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:57,436
Tell her to stop acting
like one, then.

650
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:59,397
Colin, they're more trouble
than they're worth.

651
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:01,232
Get the bags, will you?

652
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,230
Hello.
Welcome to the Nessun Dorma.

653
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:10,118
Wait a minute.

654
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:15,671
You'll be wanting a room,
then, will you?

655
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:18,115
I'd like a single room
for the girls.

656
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:19,599
Okay.

657
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:22,479
And a double room for me.

658
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:25,154
You two gents will be sharing,
will you?

659
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:26,878
- No.
- No, no.

660
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:29,110
It's not a problem if you do.

661
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:31,350
We have a very liberal attitude
in here.

662
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:34,159
We won't be sharing, but
thank you very much for asking.

663
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:35,355
I'm not staying.

664
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:36,874
Well, please yourself.

665
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:40,555
I just ask you to stick your
moniker on there if you would.

666
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:41,550
Down here?

667
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:43,438
Just at the bottom there.

668
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:46,751
If you want to wait in the bar,
we’ll prepare the rooms for you.

669
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:49,434
- There you go.
- Alright.

670
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:03,713
Alright.
You girls make yourselves...

671
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,674
I was just thinking, Col,
since I gave you a lift,

672
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:31,958
any chance you could take
the monster for a couple hours?

673
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:42,320
- Alright, Ron.
- Good man. What you having?

674
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:44,391
I'll have a pint of bitter,
please.

675
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:46,198
So, what can I do for you?

676
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:48,112
Hey, I hardly know you.

677
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:51,113
Makes it more exciting.
Don't you think?

678
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:53,833
I'll bring 'em through.

679
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:56,070
So is that your wife and kids?

680
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:58,549
No, no, no.
I'm single, me.

681
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:00,233
Young, free, and single.

682
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:02,231
So what you doing
here in Blackpool?

683
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:03,958
Just checking out the sights.

684
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:07,749
You know, seeing
what Blackpool has to offer.

685
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:10,354
Have you ever been
on the Big Dipper?

686
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:19,477
Do you want to get away
from Ron for a bit?

687
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:02,078
Want to go up there?

688
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,510
Mind your shoes don't fall off.

689
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,994
Thanks for today.

690
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:52,357
That's alright.
I've enjoyed meself.

691
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:57,676
I think I'd best go see Ron.
He'll be worrying.

692
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,435
He won't be, will he?

693
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:04,750
I'd say no.

694
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:10,834
I find myself with some
right titheads, I do, Colin.

695
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:13,150
I don't even like him.

696
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:18,112
I only came here 'cause I wanted
an holiday with Ebony.

697
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:25,751
I best go look for me friends.

698
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:29,799
Well, if you don't find them,
we’ll be on the number-1 tram.

699
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:43,671
Gonna get you!

700
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:07,189
Come and get your
souvenir photograph.

701
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:09,430
It's only a quid.
Come and have a look.

702
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:12,080
It's only a pound for a picture.

703
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:15,949
Only take a second. You see them
on the screen before you buy.

704
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:19,317
It's only a quid,
if you want one.

705
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:23,314
Oh. Sorry, there, mate.
I'm going off on one.

706
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:27,993
There you go, duck.
Have a look at the screen there.

707
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:29,229
Look at the screen.

708
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:30,799
That's it.
Cheers.

709
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:32,553
Just give it a smile.

710
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:35,837
It's only a quid
for a little black-and-white.

711
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:39,951
Not interested?
It's only a yes or a no.

712
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:42,759
I realise you're probably lost.
It's a complicated town.

713
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:46,037
But it's a no.

714
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:50,077
What a no, right?
What a no.

715
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:51,639
Never mind.

716
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:54,314
Never did he mind me.

717
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:57,279
Anybody else?
What about you with Pikachu?

718
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,640
If you find this exhibition
hard to swallow,

719
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:06,714
meet Dagamar Rockne, the man
who can swallow anything.

720
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:03,550
It's 25 past.
What are you doing?

721
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:05,039
Are the shirts alright?

722
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:06,110
Fine.

723
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:09,716
Don't carry them like that.
Carry them so they hang.

724
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:12,749
Where's the lads?

725
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:14,274
I don't know.

726
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:15,919
I bet they got pissed
last night.

727
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,399
I wish we had.

728
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:19,994
With a day like I've got today,
come off it.

729
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:21,479
Well, I'm drinking today.

730
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:25,110
You can do what you like.
I'm not bothered.

731
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:26,190
I have noted it.

732
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:28,920
Oh, yeah?
And what do you mean by that?

733
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,230
"I want to walk down the Mile
with thee.

734
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:33,391
We could take in a show."

735
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:35,153
All I've taken in
is your trousers.

736
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:37,072
Well, hey!
Nik Nik!

737
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:38,594
Hey, up.

738
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:41,149
I can't believe
I've been drawn against you.

739
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:44,153
- Hello, me darling.
- Hi.

740
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:47,551
Hey, them trous are a bit tight,
aren't they?

741
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:51,392
This is a nightmare, is this.

742
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:59,994
Ladies and gentlemen,
will you please welcome onstage,

743
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:02,549
for today's second semifinal,

744
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:07,510
from the Twelve Nights Inn,
Mick Thornton!

745
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:12,231
And from the Athletic Arms,
Geoff Atkins!

746
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:13,993
Go on, Geoff!

747
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:16,549
Go on, Geoff!

748
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:18,836
- Alright, Geoff.
- Go on, Geoff.

749
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:27,872
It's the Twelve Nights Inn
to throw first.

750
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:30,190
Game on!

751
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:46,913
85.

752
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:52,229
Come on, Geoff.

753
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:57,153
Come on, Geoff.

754
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:04,159
6.

755
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:30,232
121 !

756
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,389
Yeah! Yeah!

757
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:40,234
Come on, Geoff.

758
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:55,398
60.

759
01:14:57,440 --> 01:14:59,636
Hey, Nik Nik.

760
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:06,797
81 .

761
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:12,313
Twelve Night!
Twelve Night!

762
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:16,314
Twelve Night! Twelve Night!
Twelve Night!

763
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:19,111
45.

764
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:30,877
100.

765
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:41,555
57.

766
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:51,119
26.

767
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:54,760
Come on, now.
Keep your focus.

768
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:00,434
What you done to your hair?

769
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:02,238
Have a word with you
outside, Sandra?

770
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:04,277
Hey.
Just a minute, Colin.

771
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:06,397
I've got nowt to say
to thee, Geoff.

772
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:09,074
So why don't you
just go back over there

773
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:10,878
and carry on watching the darts?

774
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:13,110
Well, why don't you
just clear off, Colin?

775
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:17,080
- You're not wanted here.
- She's my wife, Geoff.

776
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:19,071
My wife.

777
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:21,595
I've come to have a word
with her, alright?

778
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:23,751
You're very plain, Colin.
Alright.

779
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:27,435
Sandra, do you want a word
with your ex-husband?

780
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:29,989
- Yeah. I do.
-97.

781
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:35,879
Well, I'll see you
in a minute, Sand.

782
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:39,393
Lost your woman and all now,
Nik Nik?

783
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:43,759
Right. I've had it
with that little bugger.

784
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:46,673
Come on, lads.
We're gonna sort 'em out.

785
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:48,478
Come on.

786
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:00,276
Alright.
Anyone fancy a pint?

787
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:02,351
I'll give you a hand.

788
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:13,277
You had a good weekend?

789
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:15,920
Not bad.

790
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,037
How was the darts going?

791
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:19,633
Alright.

792
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:23,236
Eric Bristow's here.

793
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:24,799
Is he?

794
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:31,795
I'm glad you come, Colin.

795
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:36,676
I nearly didn't, though.

796
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,991
Thought, "What point?"

797
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:43,479
It clearly got bored.

798
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:44,789
Let us finish, Sand.

799
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:47,156
It got bored.

800
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:48,992
That's what happened.

801
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:53,352
We'd gone off like bad milk.

802
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:57,754
And I hadn't seen it coming.

803
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:00,832
Oh, aye, everyone else had.
But I didn't.

804
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:06,039
I thought
I were making you happy.

805
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:16,359
You'll never know how much that
hurt, seeing thee and Geoff.

806
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:22,636
I went to bed that night,
and I saw the dents

807
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:26,076
in the pillow
where our heads had been.

808
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:29,710
And I thought, "She ain't never
gonna be in this bed again."

809
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:33,391
I wanted to die.

810
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:37,555
I couldn't have stopped crying.

811
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:40,871
When I did, I'd just think
of the pillow,

812
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:43,474
and I'd be off again.

813
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:45,471
Daft, isn't it?

814
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:50,590
I'm leaving Geoff.

815
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:57,119
Good.

816
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:05,235
I've been a daft sod, haven't I?

817
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:08,834
There's nowt wrong
with thee, Sand.

818
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:15,716
Do you want a hug?

819
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,355
Sorry, Colin.

820
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:26,518
I love you so much.

821
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:30,352
But I've spent so much
of me life

822
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:33,273
just watching the world
out the shop window.

823
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:36,512
I thought that was all
we both wanted.

824
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:41,151
But now I'm seeing
the world from this end.

825
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:45,750
And I want to keep going.

826
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:49,436
I don't want to stop.

827
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:53,594
I don't want to go back
to the shop.

828
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:56,516
To the pub.

829
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:58,432
To me.

830
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,196
I'm sorry, Sand.

831
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:16,200
So what am I gonna do now?

832
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:28,752
The shop's yours now.

833
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,310
You can do whatever you want
with it.

834
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:39,597
I'm gonna see what's 'round
the next corner.

835
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:45,079
You take good care, Col.

836
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:49,990
And thee.

837
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:37,557
It's a good bike.
Lots of chrome.

838
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:39,517
Great for touring, cruising.

839
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:41,079
Beautiful bike.

840
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:42,355
What about that one?

841
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:46,149
Sports tourer
with 190 miles an hour.

842
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:48,390
I know.
Quick bike.

843
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:54,038
That's the one for me.

844
01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:55,872
Great choice.
