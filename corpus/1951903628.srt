1
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:18,857
Listen.

2
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,367
Can you hear it?

3
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:27,766
The music.

4
00:00:30,446 --> 00:00:32,710
I can hear it everywhere.

5
00:00:35,284 --> 00:00:37,047
In the wind...

6
00:00:38,688 --> 00:00:40,485
...in the air...

7
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,422
...in the light.

8
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:52,259
It's all around us.

9
00:01:02,111 --> 00:01:05,774
All you have to do is open yourself up.

10
00:01:16,292 --> 00:01:18,317
All you have to do...

11
00:01:19,395 --> 00:01:21,226
...is listen.

12
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:14,848
Hello, Porky. Where' s your little friend?

13
00:02:15,017 --> 00:02:18,214
- I don't know, Mr. Mannix.
- Go find him or your big butt's mine.

14
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,083
Where I've grown up--

15
00:02:21,257 --> 00:02:22,281
Evan!

16
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:25,884
Evan!

17
00:02:26,061 --> 00:02:28,723
--they tried to stop me
from hearing the music.

18
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:34,927
But when I'm alone...

19
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:39,605
...it builds up from inside me.

20
00:02:41,977 --> 00:02:44,275
And I think if I could learn
how to play it...

21
00:02:49,185 --> 00:02:50,516
... they might hear me.

22
00:02:52,888 --> 00:02:55,118
They would know I was theirs...

23
00:02:56,592 --> 00:02:58,389
...and find me.

24
00:03:00,429 --> 00:03:02,420
Knock, knock.

25
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:04,691
- Knock, knock.
- Knock, knock.

26
00:03:04,867 --> 00:03:05,993
- Knock, knock.
- Wake up.

27
00:03:06,168 --> 00:03:08,033
Who's there? Who's there?

28
00:03:09,071 --> 00:03:12,234
Freak. Freak.

29
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:16,973
- Said, knock, knock, freak.
- Who's there?

30
00:03:17,146 --> 00:03:19,979
Your long-lost mommy and daddy.

31
00:03:21,517 --> 00:03:23,178
Can you hear them?

32
00:03:24,186 --> 00:03:25,847
Yes.

33
00:03:30,326 --> 00:03:32,157
No, you can't.

34
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:34,293
I can.

35
00:03:39,101 --> 00:03:41,797
You don't have no family.

36
00:03:42,505 --> 00:03:44,666
You can't hear anything.

37
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,607
Say it.

38
00:03:48,644 --> 00:03:50,407
- Say it.
- Say it. Say it.

39
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:52,479
- Say it.
- Say it.

40
00:03:52,648 --> 00:03:53,774
- Say it.
- Say it.

41
00:03:53,949 --> 00:03:55,678
Say it.

42
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:58,186
Yes...

43
00:03:58,921 --> 00:03:59,945
...I can.

44
00:04:02,024 --> 00:04:04,185
He doesn't hear anything.

45
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:06,158
Yeah.

46
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:08,758
What is he?

47
00:04:10,266 --> 00:04:11,824
He's a freak.

48
00:04:15,504 --> 00:04:18,132
- Sweet dreams, freaks.
- Sleep tight.

49
00:04:18,307 --> 00:04:20,798
- Good night.
- Don't let the bed bugs bite.

50
00:04:26,415 --> 00:04:28,679
Sometimes the world
tries to knock it out of you.

51
00:04:32,788 --> 00:04:34,779
But I believe in music...

52
00:04:34,957 --> 00:04:38,154
...the way that some people
believe in fairy tales.

53
00:04:50,472 --> 00:04:55,967
I like to imagine that what I hear
came from my mother and father.

54
00:05:14,263 --> 00:05:16,424
Maybe the notes I hear...

55
00:05:16,599 --> 00:05:21,366
...are the same ones they heard
the night they met.

56
00:05:22,972 --> 00:05:26,100
Maybe that's how they found each other.

57
00:05:28,978 --> 00:05:31,469
Maybe that's how they'll find me.

58
00:05:32,381 --> 00:05:34,872
Louis. Louie, where are you?

59
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:37,712
- Lyla? She' s here. What are you doing?
- Dad.

60
00:05:37,886 --> 00:05:41,344
They're waiting for us.
Hey, sit up straight, please.

61
00:05:41,523 --> 00:05:44,083
Where are you, baby bro?

62
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:47,524
We didn't follow you from San Francisco
to play for free, man. Yeah?

63
00:05:47,696 --> 00:05:51,029
We need this one, baby bro. All right?
I need this one.

64
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,031
Don't forget to smile and look relaxed.

65
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:57,132
All right, not that relaxed.
Come on, come on.

66
00:06:00,609 --> 00:06:03,373
I believe that, once upon a time...

67
00:06:04,013 --> 00:06:05,742
...Iong ago...

68
00:06:07,049 --> 00:06:10,450
...they heard the music and followed it.

69
00:09:03,425 --> 00:09:06,553
- Not bad, Connelly. Not bad.
- Thanks very much, man.

70
00:09:06,728 --> 00:09:07,956
Where's the main man?

71
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:10,925
Goddamn it, Louis. Just wait, man.

72
00:09:12,701 --> 00:09:16,262
Louis? Louis, wait up, man.

73
00:09:19,474 --> 00:09:22,602
Girls, we are going to a party tonight.

74
00:09:22,778 --> 00:09:26,111
It's a full moon,
you know what that means, right?

75
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,751
Lyla.

76
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:25,673
It's a great sound, isn't it?

77
00:10:27,142 --> 00:10:29,201
What are you doing?

78
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:31,005
Listening.

79
00:10:33,715 --> 00:10:35,046
What are you doing?

80
00:10:37,586 --> 00:10:42,182
- I just came up here to....
- Get away?

81
00:10:47,262 --> 00:10:48,991
Have a seat.

82
00:10:49,164 --> 00:10:52,531
Come on, be brave.

83
00:10:52,701 --> 00:10:54,669
Front row, center.

84
00:11:20,095 --> 00:11:21,687
Can you hear that?

85
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,262
What is that?

86
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,429
It's a wish.

87
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:37,537
Now, what does that sound like?

88
00:11:58,533 --> 00:12:00,524
When I was a young fellow...

89
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:03,668
...I used to talk to the moon.

90
00:12:04,973 --> 00:12:06,600
Are you making that up?

91
00:12:08,777 --> 00:12:10,768
God, I haven't done that in a long time.

92
00:12:14,016 --> 00:12:16,610
Does it ever talk back?

93
00:12:18,186 --> 00:12:20,245
Well, it used to.

94
00:12:21,957 --> 00:12:25,415
Now I just find myself on a roof
talking to myself...

95
00:12:25,594 --> 00:12:28,085
...Iike a loon.

96
00:12:30,365 --> 00:12:34,392
Just out here on me own.

97
00:12:36,838 --> 00:12:38,669
Well, I'm here.

98
00:12:41,176 --> 00:12:43,235
Yes, you are.

99
00:12:52,087 --> 00:12:53,611
I'm Louis.

100
00:12:56,091 --> 00:12:57,786
Lyla.

101
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,621
So, what's your story, Lyla?

102
00:13:02,998 --> 00:13:05,364
I don't know. I'm just....

103
00:13:08,236 --> 00:13:10,466
I'm just me.

104
00:13:17,312 --> 00:13:19,212
What are you looking at?

105
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,039
You.

106
00:14:19,341 --> 00:14:20,865
Next.

107
00:14:21,943 --> 00:14:23,877
What did he want? What did you say?

108
00:14:24,045 --> 00:14:26,741
You know, same old junk. New guy.

109
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,174
My name is Mr. Jeffries.

110
00:14:30,352 --> 00:14:34,379
I'm with Child Services
for the state of New York.

111
00:14:35,323 --> 00:14:37,348
Okay, Evan.

112
00:14:37,526 --> 00:14:41,963
Born December 17th, 1995.

113
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:45,463
Legal adoption to New York Children's.

114
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:51,265
How long have you been here, Evan?

115
00:14:51,606 --> 00:14:53,471
Eleven years and sixteen days.

116
00:14:55,744 --> 00:14:57,268
I've been counting.

117
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,147
That's a long time.

118
00:15:00,749 --> 00:15:03,684
- How do you do that?
- Do what?

119
00:15:08,523 --> 00:15:10,991
Well, it's just imitating the wind chimes.

120
00:15:24,439 --> 00:15:27,272
You don't wanna be placed
with a real family?

121
00:15:27,442 --> 00:15:30,707
- I have a family.
- Yes, you do.

122
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:34,212
I mean, you have parents and all,
but they don't live with you.

123
00:15:34,382 --> 00:15:35,542
Not now.

124
00:15:35,984 --> 00:15:39,784
But still,
you don't have contact with them.

125
00:15:39,955 --> 00:15:43,413
- Yes, I do.
- You do?

126
00:15:47,462 --> 00:15:48,690
What, do they call you?

127
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:52,394
Come and visit you?

128
00:15:52,867 --> 00:15:54,129
- Send--?
- l....

129
00:15:57,005 --> 00:15:59,166
I don't wanna be sent away.

130
00:16:02,143 --> 00:16:04,077
I understand.

131
00:16:05,947 --> 00:16:08,643
You see, there's a lot of children...

132
00:16:08,817 --> 00:16:11,513
...who are scared
that if they leave their first home...

133
00:16:11,686 --> 00:16:14,018
...their parents would never
be able to find them.

134
00:16:15,123 --> 00:16:16,681
Right?

135
00:16:17,292 --> 00:16:19,021
But see, my job is to make sure...

136
00:16:19,194 --> 00:16:22,630
...that nothing like that
will ever happen to you.

137
00:16:22,797 --> 00:16:25,925
So there's nothing to be scared of.

138
00:16:27,535 --> 00:16:29,230
Thank you.

139
00:16:35,543 --> 00:16:38,171
I'm gonna do something I never do.

140
00:16:39,381 --> 00:16:41,576
This is my number.

141
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:45,948
If you ever need to talk to me,
about anything...

142
00:16:47,555 --> 00:16:49,045
...you call.

143
00:16:49,224 --> 00:16:51,715
Think about what I said too.

144
00:16:52,327 --> 00:16:56,354
There's a whole world out there
with millions of wind chimes.

145
00:16:56,965 --> 00:16:58,296
I know.

146
00:17:05,907 --> 00:17:07,238
You can go now.

147
00:17:18,019 --> 00:17:20,715
Mannix says we're never
gonna see our real parents again.

148
00:17:20,889 --> 00:17:23,016
Mannix is a big liar.

149
00:17:23,825 --> 00:17:26,988
Yeah, I know. But what if he's right?

150
00:17:27,162 --> 00:17:30,359
I mean, what if they don't ever come?

151
00:17:30,532 --> 00:17:33,467
Hardly remember what my mom
looks like, you know?

152
00:17:33,935 --> 00:17:40,101
Well, if they don't find us,
we'll just have to go find them.

153
00:18:19,881 --> 00:18:20,939
- Oh, my God.
- Morning.

154
00:18:21,116 --> 00:18:22,481
- How's it going?
- Oh, my God.

155
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:23,947
Get away.

156
00:18:25,186 --> 00:18:26,744
I have to go.

157
00:18:26,921 --> 00:18:29,014
- Let me walk you home.
- No.

158
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:31,158
My dad's waiting at the Sherry. I--

159
00:18:31,593 --> 00:18:34,255
I've never done this before.
I'm in so much trouble.

160
00:18:34,429 --> 00:18:36,192
Hey, hey.

161
00:18:36,364 --> 00:18:40,232
Meet me here at 1 0:.00 by the arch.

162
00:18:40,402 --> 00:18:42,836
- Say yes.
- Put him out of his misery. Say yes.

163
00:18:43,004 --> 00:18:44,494
- Say yes.
- Say it.

164
00:18:44,672 --> 00:18:46,333
Say yes.

165
00:18:49,944 --> 00:18:51,468
After you.

166
00:18:52,447 --> 00:18:53,880
I'll take that as a yes.

167
00:18:58,386 --> 00:19:02,379
You are gonna be in so much trouble.
You should have left your dad a note.

168
00:19:02,557 --> 00:19:05,253
Yeah, ransom note.
You know what? I don't even care.

169
00:19:05,427 --> 00:19:08,692
I just had the most incredible night
of my life.

170
00:19:08,863 --> 00:19:10,160
Taxi!

171
00:19:17,372 --> 00:19:19,932
Louis. She ain't coming.

172
00:19:20,108 --> 00:19:23,271
Oh, man. One girl?

173
00:19:23,445 --> 00:19:26,039
Come on, we're gonna miss the flight.

174
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:32,843
- Taxi!
- Louis. Where you going, Louis?

175
00:19:35,056 --> 00:19:36,216
Excuse me.

176
00:19:37,826 --> 00:19:39,487
Louie.

177
00:19:40,695 --> 00:19:42,026
You are not going anywhere.

178
00:19:42,497 --> 00:19:45,193
- Lyla!
- Dad, I'm not going with you.

179
00:19:45,366 --> 00:19:48,096
- Lyla, you listen to me.
- No.

180
00:19:48,269 --> 00:19:50,965
- Don't you dare walk away.
- I'm not going with you.

181
00:19:58,213 --> 00:20:00,306
Lyla!

182
00:20:05,854 --> 00:20:08,618
Get in the car right now.

183
00:20:11,659 --> 00:20:14,059
Lyla! Lyla!

184
00:20:27,242 --> 00:20:28,869
Louis.

185
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,913
Do you remember what Da used to say
about princesses?

186
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:39,144
They're always looking for their prince.
And you ain't no prince, brother.

187
00:20:40,388 --> 00:20:41,514
How would you know?

188
00:20:42,524 --> 00:20:44,424
What am I gonna do now?

189
00:20:58,673 --> 00:21:00,868
I know they're out there somewhere.

190
00:21:15,256 --> 00:21:17,656
I don 't know where it comes from...

191
00:21:21,329 --> 00:21:23,126
...but it's what I hold on to.

192
00:21:27,535 --> 00:21:29,662
And I can 't let go.

193
00:21:34,142 --> 00:21:35,541
Somewhere inside me...

194
00:21:36,978 --> 00:21:39,674
...I know that they always wanted me.

195
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:44,450
Maybe they just got lost.

196
00:22:50,918 --> 00:22:53,443
What's the point in singing, Marshall?

197
00:22:54,322 --> 00:22:55,949
She's not gonna hear me.

198
00:22:56,791 --> 00:22:59,760
I'm leaving the band.
I'm sorry, Marshall.

199
00:22:59,927 --> 00:23:01,895
Don 't quit on us, Louis.

200
00:23:07,835 --> 00:23:10,497
Everything you ' ve given up,
everything I ' ve given up--

201
00:23:12,273 --> 00:23:14,935
I can ' t do it. I ' m sorry, Frank.
I can ' t do it, man.

202
00:23:15,109 --> 00:23:16,804
- Listen to me. Listen to me.
- No!

203
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:19,139
- You know what I mean? I don't know...
- Dad!

204
00:23:19,313 --> 00:23:20,803
...how to approach this problem.

205
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:22,973
I mean, where are you
gonna put the baby?

206
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:26,177
And what about this boy?
He's not here now. He's not here now.

207
00:23:26,354 --> 00:23:27,753
- I'm leaving.
- You can't leave.

208
00:23:27,922 --> 00:23:30,982
- Where you going, then?
- Just let me go. Will you just let me go?

209
00:23:38,499 --> 00:23:40,626
- Louis.
- Lyla.

210
00:23:43,871 --> 00:23:45,270
Hey, Louis.

211
00:23:46,641 --> 00:23:48,108
Lyla.

212
00:24:11,566 --> 00:24:13,227
We have fetal distress.

213
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:17,194
Baby's heart rate is falling.

214
00:24:19,607 --> 00:24:21,268
It's falling.

215
00:24:49,871 --> 00:24:51,634
I'm sorry.

216
00:24:56,377 --> 00:24:58,242
He's gone.

217
00:26:01,943 --> 00:26:04,207
Picked him up on the thruway
outside of Montrose.

218
00:26:04,378 --> 00:26:07,438
Just wandering down the road.
Said he's following the music.

219
00:26:07,615 --> 00:26:10,277
The moon told him to.
Yeah. Kid's a space cadet.

220
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:18,658
Look, I got a busy day ahead of me.

221
00:26:19,794 --> 00:26:22,092
All right, big guy, out you go.

222
00:26:22,263 --> 00:26:24,356
This Jeffries guy wasn't in his office yet...

223
00:26:24,532 --> 00:26:27,126
...so I left him a message
to pick you up right here.

224
00:26:27,301 --> 00:26:28,962
- Okay.
- Here. Hold on.

225
00:26:29,136 --> 00:26:32,264
Don't lose it. If he doesn't show
in an hour, give him another call.

226
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,101
You can handle that, right?

227
00:26:34,275 --> 00:26:35,833
- Yeah.
- You got any money?

228
00:26:36,277 --> 00:26:40,304
Here's 12 bucks.
Damn, kid, put it in your pocket.

229
00:26:40,481 --> 00:26:42,244
See you.

230
00:28:43,104 --> 00:28:44,765
Get on the sidewalk.

231
00:29:27,648 --> 00:29:28,808
Yeah.

232
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:51,134
Okay, citizen. You paid. Any requests?

233
00:29:51,305 --> 00:29:52,772
No.

234
00:29:54,208 --> 00:29:55,573
Alrighty, then.

235
00:30:29,176 --> 00:30:32,475
Back off. Away, away. Yo, son,
you're messing with my equilibrium.

236
00:30:32,646 --> 00:30:35,911
Nobody touches this instrument but me.
Roxy's my girl.

237
00:30:36,083 --> 00:30:38,677
Son, we done here,
so why don't you go find your mommy.

238
00:30:39,153 --> 00:30:41,781
- I don't know where she is.
- Good, that's just great.

239
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:44,749
Cops show up around 6.
Tell them you're AWOL.

240
00:30:44,925 --> 00:30:46,825
They'll send you back
where you come from.

241
00:30:46,994 --> 00:30:48,359
I don't wanna go back there.

242
00:30:49,196 --> 00:30:50,686
Well, good.

243
00:30:50,865 --> 00:30:53,265
This day's been a bust, anyway. I'm out.

244
00:31:14,855 --> 00:31:15,913
What?

245
00:31:18,192 --> 00:31:19,819
I don't have a place to stay.

246
00:31:20,661 --> 00:31:23,152
Do I look like a real-estate tycoon
to you?

247
00:31:26,767 --> 00:31:28,564
How many dead presidents you got?

248
00:31:29,136 --> 00:31:31,434
Nuggets? Shorts?

249
00:31:31,605 --> 00:31:33,004
Show me the money.

250
00:31:37,778 --> 00:31:42,078
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- No, I'm thinking something else.

251
00:31:44,318 --> 00:31:46,479
I'm gonna let you buy me a pizza.

252
00:32:02,102 --> 00:32:05,936
I've been doing this for 10 years, Bob.
I said 10 percent.

253
00:32:07,107 --> 00:32:09,507
We need to close the deal.
Hold on a second.

254
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:12,908
No. We said 1 0 percent.

255
00:32:13,814 --> 00:32:16,806
Yeah, well, it makes the world go round,
doesn't it, Bob?

256
00:32:17,785 --> 00:32:20,151
Just get me the 10 percent, will you?

257
00:32:20,321 --> 00:32:21,811
Thanks.

258
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:28,924
- Need anything, sir?
- Do you know any hit men?

259
00:32:29,096 --> 00:32:31,656
I do know a bass player
might be able to help you out.

260
00:32:31,832 --> 00:32:33,857
Likes to get in fights with lead singers.

261
00:32:36,036 --> 00:32:37,162
Nick?

262
00:32:38,939 --> 00:32:40,907
What are you doing, man?

263
00:32:42,443 --> 00:32:45,344
Still driving. Paying off
those wedding bills from last year.

264
00:32:45,512 --> 00:32:48,003
Oh, fair play to you. Oh, she's a nice girl.

265
00:32:49,416 --> 00:32:51,145
So you playing at all?

266
00:32:51,585 --> 00:32:52,745
Nope.

267
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,045
Why the hell not? Your fingers fall off?

268
00:32:56,223 --> 00:32:58,020
Well, you move on.

269
00:33:00,294 --> 00:33:03,263
What about the lads?
Seen any of them lately?

270
00:33:04,598 --> 00:33:06,532
We still mess around...

271
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:10,659
...but the Connelly Brothers never really
bounced back minus one brother.

272
00:33:15,175 --> 00:33:16,699
You seen Marshall lately?

273
00:33:17,645 --> 00:33:19,112
Have you?

274
00:33:22,316 --> 00:33:23,908
It's my birthday on Saturday.

275
00:33:24,518 --> 00:33:27,544
Session's at my place.
Come, bring your girlfriend.

276
00:33:28,422 --> 00:33:30,515
It's great seeing you, man.

277
00:33:30,691 --> 00:33:34,491
Reminds me of New York.
The good old days, eh?

278
00:33:43,737 --> 00:33:45,295
I know.

279
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:47,702
I know.

280
00:33:47,875 --> 00:33:51,276
I know. Okay, I don't know.

281
00:33:51,478 --> 00:33:54,675
"Für Elise" by Beethoven.
And you should know that one.

282
00:33:54,848 --> 00:33:56,907
Oh, yeah.

283
00:33:57,084 --> 00:33:59,552
Will you be our teacher forever,
Miss Novacek?

284
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,712
Well, at least until your old teacher
comes back.

285
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:06,155
But only if you call me...?

286
00:34:06,327 --> 00:34:08,557
- Lyla.
- That's right.

287
00:34:08,729 --> 00:34:10,196
You're crazy, Miss Novacek.

288
00:34:10,364 --> 00:34:11,626
- Megan.
- Got everything?

289
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:16,065
- Okay.
- Bye.

290
00:34:17,905 --> 00:34:20,465
Hi, sweetie.

291
00:34:21,008 --> 00:34:22,999
Did you have a good day?

292
00:34:24,411 --> 00:34:25,605
Thanks.

293
00:34:25,779 --> 00:34:26,973
- There you are.
- Hey.

294
00:34:27,147 --> 00:34:30,844
Okay, now, before you say no....
Okay, picture this.

295
00:34:31,018 --> 00:34:35,250
You on stage, me accompanying,
thousands of people.

296
00:34:35,422 --> 00:34:36,889
- Liz.
- The New York Philharmonic.

297
00:34:37,057 --> 00:34:39,890
I just got the invite. They want you back.

298
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:42,790
It's just one night,
but they want you back.

299
00:34:44,365 --> 00:34:46,526
I don't wanna be up there.

300
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,190
Lyla....

301
00:34:49,002 --> 00:34:51,266
When are you gonna let yourself
be happy again?

302
00:34:51,438 --> 00:34:53,804
I am happy.

303
00:34:54,608 --> 00:34:57,941
I'm talking about
when everyone else goes home.

304
00:35:04,918 --> 00:35:06,749
Look....

305
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:09,445
I know. Okay? I know.

306
00:35:10,991 --> 00:35:12,322
Just think about it.

307
00:35:12,493 --> 00:35:17,123
I mean, you're a music teacher
who doesn't play music anymore.

308
00:35:17,598 --> 00:35:19,498
Call me crazy.

309
00:35:19,666 --> 00:35:21,293
Okay, Crazy.

310
00:35:21,468 --> 00:35:24,028
- I'll see you at home, okay?
- All right.

311
00:35:35,382 --> 00:35:37,873
No, I ain't got no daddy.

312
00:35:39,386 --> 00:35:40,648
See, my pops is a drunk.

313
00:35:40,821 --> 00:35:44,416
And my mama, she took off
with this crackhead named Little Jesus.

314
00:35:44,591 --> 00:35:47,856
But, you know, he wasn't no little Jesus,
you know what I'm saying?

315
00:35:48,028 --> 00:35:51,429
No, they never gave a damn about me.

316
00:35:51,598 --> 00:35:55,500
Come on, man. This is us right here.

317
00:35:57,604 --> 00:36:00,539
- I've been with Wizard for years.
- Who's Wizard?

318
00:36:00,707 --> 00:36:03,073
Oh, he's a real piece of work,
that's what he is.

319
00:36:03,243 --> 00:36:05,803
His real name's Maxwell Wallace.

320
00:36:05,979 --> 00:36:09,107
He took me in.
He said that I was an investment.

321
00:36:09,283 --> 00:36:12,377
He gave me Roxy here.
He bought it in the old days.

322
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:16,153
Well, he really didn't buy it.
Guess you'd kind of say he found it.

323
00:36:16,323 --> 00:36:17,620
All right, he stole it.

324
00:36:17,791 --> 00:36:19,952
Wizard?
He gave me his place at the Square.

325
00:36:20,127 --> 00:36:22,618
My parents? They ain't gave me nothing.

326
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:28,100
We all gonna be big stars someday.

327
00:36:29,102 --> 00:36:32,299
- What's the password?
- Open the damn door already.

328
00:36:33,607 --> 00:36:35,370
You're getting on my nerves with that.

329
00:36:39,847 --> 00:36:41,872
Okay, follow me.

330
00:36:45,319 --> 00:36:48,254
What's your name again?
It's Evan, right?

331
00:36:49,656 --> 00:36:52,022
Yo, this is our home, son.

332
00:36:52,192 --> 00:36:54,990
It's kind of crazy in here,
so stay on your feet.

333
00:36:57,564 --> 00:36:58,724
Watch out.

334
00:36:58,899 --> 00:37:02,096
Yeah, I've been living here for a while.
Come on, man.

335
00:37:02,269 --> 00:37:03,998
Hey, check it out.

336
00:37:04,171 --> 00:37:05,661
- How much you make?
- Ten dollars.

337
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:07,773
- You lying. Let me see.
- I am not lying.

338
00:37:07,941 --> 00:37:09,909
What did I tell you about that?

339
00:37:12,346 --> 00:37:15,247
- Hey, it's Arthur.
- I'll be laughing at your funeral.

340
00:37:15,415 --> 00:37:17,474
- I'm gonna go play basketball.
- All clear.

341
00:37:23,957 --> 00:37:26,619
Man, you should've knocked him
in his head, son.

342
00:37:37,538 --> 00:37:39,369
Shoot it, shoot it, shoot it!

343
00:37:44,311 --> 00:37:45,710
Pizza!

344
00:37:50,817 --> 00:37:52,876
Pizza, pizza, pizza.

345
00:38:07,301 --> 00:38:08,666
Don't make me come up there.

346
00:38:08,835 --> 00:38:10,928
Yo, you better hurry
before Wizard shows.

347
00:38:11,104 --> 00:38:13,664
He'll be pissed
if he's seen you bought a pie.

348
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:15,702
I ain't take no family money.

349
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:17,173
Citizen bought it.

350
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,176
Hola, music lovers.

351
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:25,181
While the cat's away....

352
00:38:27,554 --> 00:38:28,851
Who likes pizza?

353
00:38:31,091 --> 00:38:32,388
Who did this?

354
00:38:33,994 --> 00:38:35,256
Arthur?

355
00:38:41,268 --> 00:38:43,327
- What is he?
- He's a damn fool.

356
00:38:43,503 --> 00:38:45,937
He's a damn fool.

357
00:38:46,106 --> 00:38:47,733
He's gonna get it good.

358
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:49,739
What are you, Arthur?

359
00:38:50,243 --> 00:38:52,177
I'm a real piece of work, Wizard.

360
00:38:53,847 --> 00:38:55,542
You're on thin ice.

361
00:38:56,049 --> 00:39:00,042
I didn't take no family money.
He bought it.

362
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:06,758
What?

363
00:39:07,127 --> 00:39:08,424
You look crazy.

364
00:39:10,063 --> 00:39:11,189
I am crazy.

365
00:39:14,568 --> 00:39:15,967
See?

366
00:39:16,837 --> 00:39:17,895
Come here.

367
00:39:20,774 --> 00:39:22,298
Now!

368
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:25,043
Come on.

369
00:39:28,382 --> 00:39:31,317
- What's your name?
- Evan, sir.

370
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,450
What are you doing here?

371
00:39:34,254 --> 00:39:36,051
I followed the music.

372
00:39:41,528 --> 00:39:44,793
Where did you pick this one up,
Arthur, Bellevue?

373
00:39:48,902 --> 00:39:51,268
You never played a note in your life.

374
00:39:51,438 --> 00:39:53,463
Do you know what music is?

375
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:59,272
It's God's little reminder there's
something else besides us in this universe.

376
00:39:59,813 --> 00:40:05,445
Harmonic connection between
all living beings everywhere, even the stars.

377
00:40:06,186 --> 00:40:08,086
Is this a school?

378
00:40:08,255 --> 00:40:11,486
Yeah, the school of
Screw You and Take All Your Damn Money.

379
00:40:11,658 --> 00:40:13,523
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we're top of the class.

380
00:40:13,694 --> 00:40:15,059
Not!

381
00:40:17,464 --> 00:40:18,954
It's a business.

382
00:40:21,601 --> 00:40:24,195
- Pockets.
- Okay, let's go.

383
00:40:24,371 --> 00:40:25,998
- Let's go, let's go.
- Pockets.

384
00:40:26,873 --> 00:40:27,999
Oh, man. Get up.

385
00:40:32,145 --> 00:40:33,373
Peanut, well done.

386
00:40:34,648 --> 00:40:36,309
I got eyes in the back of my head.

387
00:40:37,284 --> 00:40:38,717
Good job.

388
00:40:39,352 --> 00:40:41,547
Chain is only as strong...

389
00:40:41,988 --> 00:40:43,285
...as its weakest link.

390
00:40:45,992 --> 00:40:47,482
Come on, Arthur.

391
00:40:47,828 --> 00:40:49,386
That's chump change.

392
00:40:49,563 --> 00:40:52,896
You got Washington Square.
That was my spot for 10 years.

393
00:40:57,037 --> 00:41:00,165
Go ahead, before I change my mind.

394
00:41:04,478 --> 00:41:06,639
You kids are gonna put me
in the poorhouse.

395
00:41:07,614 --> 00:41:10,549
All right, little mice,
scurry back to your holes. Go, go.

396
00:41:13,186 --> 00:41:16,019
Harmonic dreams, sweet children.

397
00:43:46,106 --> 00:43:48,233
Roxanne. Man, I'm gonna kill him.

398
00:44:16,569 --> 00:44:18,503
You know what's out there?

399
00:44:19,139 --> 00:44:21,266
A series of higher tones.

400
00:44:21,441 --> 00:44:22,965
It's arranged by nature.

401
00:44:23,143 --> 00:44:27,204
It's governed by the laws of physics
of the whole universe.

402
00:44:28,615 --> 00:44:31,015
It's an overtone, it's an energy,
it's a wavelength.

403
00:44:31,184 --> 00:44:35,712
And if you're not riding it, good Lordy,
you'll never hear it.

404
00:44:35,889 --> 00:44:37,914
Where do you think it comes from?

405
00:44:39,726 --> 00:44:41,023
What I hear.

406
00:44:41,628 --> 00:44:45,120
I think it comes from all around you, really.
I mean, it's--

407
00:44:45,298 --> 00:44:47,129
Comes through us, some of us.

408
00:44:49,369 --> 00:44:52,429
It's invisible, but-- But you feel it.

409
00:44:53,373 --> 00:44:55,136
So only some of us can hear it?

410
00:44:56,776 --> 00:44:58,744
Only some of us are listening.

411
00:45:01,548 --> 00:45:03,880
Do you think my parents are listening?

412
00:45:04,751 --> 00:45:06,719
I hear you, kid.

413
00:45:09,889 --> 00:45:11,288
Like?

414
00:45:12,792 --> 00:45:14,384
Yeah.

415
00:45:18,331 --> 00:45:20,959
Are you hearing a word I'm saying?

416
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:25,669
Louis.

417
00:45:26,439 --> 00:45:29,272
Come on.
It's about time I met your family.

418
00:45:33,813 --> 00:45:37,305
Listen, Jen,
maybe this isn't such a good idea.

419
00:45:38,284 --> 00:45:39,308
Grow up.

420
00:45:39,786 --> 00:45:41,253
Come on.

421
00:45:43,156 --> 00:45:44,418
- Come on.
-"Grow up."

422
00:45:48,862 --> 00:45:52,491
- Are all lrish people this loud?
- Yeah.

423
00:46:16,656 --> 00:46:18,146
Hey, Louis.

424
00:46:25,065 --> 00:46:27,465
Hey, Marshall, your brother's here.

425
00:46:27,867 --> 00:46:28,891
Louis.

426
00:46:31,604 --> 00:46:33,071
Hey, Nick.

427
00:46:35,575 --> 00:46:37,236
Oh, my God.

428
00:46:38,711 --> 00:46:40,076
Is that you?

429
00:46:42,415 --> 00:46:44,906
When were you gonna tell me
you're in a band?

430
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:50,721
I'm sure there's a lot of things
our Louis hasn't told you, darling.

431
00:46:50,890 --> 00:46:53,882
- Who did you write the song for?
- I told you this is a mistake.

432
00:46:54,427 --> 00:46:57,021
That's it, go on. Walk out on us again.

433
00:46:59,999 --> 00:47:02,263
- Eh, Lou?
- Say what you gotta say, Marshall.

434
00:47:02,435 --> 00:47:04,403
- Say what you have to say.
- No, go on.

435
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:06,664
- Come on, say it.
- That the best you got?

436
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:08,501
- Say it.
- That the best you got?

437
00:47:08,675 --> 00:47:10,905
- Come on. Hit me. Come on, hit me.
- Come on.

438
00:47:11,077 --> 00:47:13,238
Feel what? Come on. Hit me.

439
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:15,878
I'm suffocating here.

440
00:47:22,689 --> 00:47:24,179
You all right, man?

441
00:47:26,259 --> 00:47:27,954
You all right, man?

442
00:47:28,628 --> 00:47:30,357
Welcome to the Connelly clan.

443
00:47:38,071 --> 00:47:39,698
Jennifer.

444
00:48:05,131 --> 00:48:08,066
You know, it was good
having the old Louis back in there...

445
00:48:08,601 --> 00:48:10,967
...even if it was only for a second.

446
00:48:12,939 --> 00:48:14,429
Louie...

447
00:48:14,874 --> 00:48:17,536
...aren't you supposed to be in the car
with the girl...

448
00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:19,871
...as she drives off into the sunset?

449
00:48:28,354 --> 00:48:30,914
You'll get your suit dirty
sitting there, man.

450
00:48:45,305 --> 00:48:47,330
This is a message for Lyla Novacek.

451
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:49,634
Please call Good Samaritan Hospital.

452
00:48:49,809 --> 00:48:53,267
I'm calling about your father,
Thomas Novacek.

453
00:49:02,889 --> 00:49:05,221
I wasn't sure you were going to come.

454
00:49:06,359 --> 00:49:08,793
My will is in the top drawer
of the desk in my study.

455
00:49:08,962 --> 00:49:11,487
Dad, stop, come on.

456
00:49:11,664 --> 00:49:13,825
Lyla, please.

457
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,797
There's more.

458
00:49:22,575 --> 00:49:28,309
All I ever wanted was for you
to have all that promise, all that life.

459
00:49:28,815 --> 00:49:30,749
But you were so young.

460
00:49:31,184 --> 00:49:33,277
We had so much work to do.

461
00:49:33,453 --> 00:49:36,718
- You weren't ready.
- That's plenty, Dad. Really.

462
00:49:37,523 --> 00:49:39,582
I mean, a baby.

463
00:49:39,759 --> 00:49:41,590
That baby, he could have hurt you.

464
00:49:44,697 --> 00:49:48,997
He could've hurt you, and l--
I wasn't gonna let that happen, Lyla.

465
00:49:54,474 --> 00:49:56,567
I made a choice for us.

466
00:50:00,413 --> 00:50:02,278
Oh, my God.

467
00:50:04,317 --> 00:50:05,545
A choice for us.

468
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,078
Wait....

469
00:50:14,227 --> 00:50:15,922
I'm sorry.

470
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,097
Where?

471
00:50:25,171 --> 00:50:27,002
Where is he?

472
00:50:27,807 --> 00:50:31,368
- I didn't mean--
- Where is he?

473
00:50:31,811 --> 00:50:33,039
I don't know.

474
00:50:35,081 --> 00:50:36,742
I don't.

475
00:50:45,725 --> 00:50:48,387
You gotta love music
more than you love food.

476
00:50:49,329 --> 00:50:52,992
More than life. More than yourself.

477
00:50:59,405 --> 00:51:00,633
You feel it?

478
00:51:04,243 --> 00:51:05,267
Then show me.

479
00:51:06,012 --> 00:51:07,980
Play it for your parents.

480
00:51:57,530 --> 00:51:59,054
You're flying, kid.

481
00:52:09,108 --> 00:52:10,666
Yeah!

482
00:52:10,843 --> 00:52:12,970
You know what I'm thinking?

483
00:52:13,846 --> 00:52:16,406
You're supposed to say,
"What are you thinking, Wizard? "

484
00:52:16,582 --> 00:52:18,880
"What are you thinking, Wizard? "

485
00:52:19,051 --> 00:52:21,485
I teach you everything I know for free.

486
00:52:21,654 --> 00:52:24,555
You get Roxanne.
You get my corner of the park.

487
00:52:24,991 --> 00:52:28,392
You get to keep half your tips.
We're like a team.

488
00:52:29,929 --> 00:52:31,897
There's something wrong
with that picture.

489
00:52:32,331 --> 00:52:33,389
What?

490
00:52:34,167 --> 00:52:37,500
I don't think performing in parks
and street corners is gonna be enough.

491
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:38,898
It won't?

492
00:52:42,074 --> 00:52:45,407
Evan, we're gonna need
to get you a new name.

493
00:52:45,578 --> 00:52:47,341
Something with a little more pop.

494
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:51,375
What do you wanna be in the world?
In the whole world, what do you wanna be?

495
00:52:51,551 --> 00:52:53,678
Close your eyes and think about that.

496
00:52:55,855 --> 00:52:57,345
Found.

497
00:53:02,595 --> 00:53:03,960
Doesn't have enough yin.

498
00:53:04,730 --> 00:53:06,857
- Little more yang, you know?
- Yeah.

499
00:53:07,033 --> 00:53:08,898
Yeah, let's....

500
00:53:10,102 --> 00:53:14,061
Talk about wishful thinking. Look at that.

501
00:53:17,210 --> 00:53:19,269
What name stands out to you
on that, huh?

502
00:53:19,445 --> 00:53:20,469
Beach?

503
00:53:20,646 --> 00:53:23,080
It's a good name for a band,
but not for a performer.

504
00:53:23,249 --> 00:53:26,184
You can't say, "Please welcome Beach."
No, no.

505
00:53:26,352 --> 00:53:30,652
August Rush. August Rush.
Doesn't that warm you up a little bit?

506
00:53:31,090 --> 00:53:34,423
I can see it.
"Wizard Productions presents...

507
00:53:34,594 --> 00:53:37,461
...the number-one heat wave:

508
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:41,088
August Rush!"

509
00:53:41,267 --> 00:53:43,827
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Me!

510
00:53:44,003 --> 00:53:46,665
- August, August, August.
- lt gives me a rush.

511
00:53:46,839 --> 00:53:50,138
That gives me chills. The hair
on the back of my neck's standing up.

512
00:53:50,309 --> 00:53:51,776
- Really?
- Yeah, look at that.

513
00:53:51,944 --> 00:53:53,377
Quick, check it out. Yeah.

514
00:53:53,546 --> 00:53:57,175
- I'm flying! I'm flying!
- Yeah. August! August Rush.

515
00:53:57,350 --> 00:53:59,648
- August.
- August Rush. August Rush.

516
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:00,843
That's you.

517
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:03,620
- August. August.
- August Rush, August Rush.

518
00:54:49,335 --> 00:54:51,599
New York, Lyla?
What are you doing in New York?

519
00:54:51,771 --> 00:54:54,535
Lizzy, I mean,
I've always felt that he was alive.

520
00:54:54,707 --> 00:55:00,009
I'd see kids that would be his age
and I'd imagine what he'd look like.

521
00:55:00,179 --> 00:55:02,943
- Big blue eyes like his dad and--
- Oh, my God, Lyla.

522
00:55:03,115 --> 00:55:07,552
Lizzy, I used to lie in bed at night
and I swear I could hear him.

523
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:10,689
- I swear I could hear him.
- Lyla, calm down.

524
00:55:10,856 --> 00:55:14,519
Calm down? How can I be calm?
How can I be calm?

525
00:55:14,694 --> 00:55:17,959
I've been calm for over 10 years
and look where it's gotten me.

526
00:55:18,130 --> 00:55:20,621
Lyla, you're losing it.

527
00:55:20,866 --> 00:55:24,097
You're right. And maybe it's about time.

528
00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:25,965
Don 't do anything crazy, okay?

529
00:55:26,138 --> 00:55:30,472
We're on our honeymoon, but we're leaving.
We'll get there as soon as we can, okay?

530
00:55:49,895 --> 00:55:52,762
Okay, Jack, he's worth three times
what you're offering him.

531
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:54,729
- Wallace--
- You heard him in the park!

532
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:56,162
You're a pain in the ass.

533
00:55:56,335 --> 00:55:59,736
- Two-fifty if he can play for two hours.
- No, five or he walks.

534
00:55:59,905 --> 00:56:04,706
- Five hundred? I'll give him 250--
- Five hundred or he walks, all right?

535
00:56:04,877 --> 00:56:08,278
- He walks?
- We have lightning in a bottle, Jack.

536
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:10,972
No, there's no parents. I'm his guardian.

537
00:56:11,150 --> 00:56:14,347
No, I'm his representation,
that's why I'm making the deal.

538
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:16,249
May I help you?

539
00:56:16,656 --> 00:56:18,886
- I'm trying to find my son.
- Hold on a second.

540
00:56:19,625 --> 00:56:21,286
Name?

541
00:56:26,599 --> 00:56:28,590
Mommy.

542
00:56:34,407 --> 00:56:36,341
Mommy.

543
00:56:39,178 --> 00:56:40,645
I don't know.

544
00:56:42,081 --> 00:56:44,641
- Mom.
- Mommy.

545
00:56:54,694 --> 00:56:56,821
Mommy, look at me.

546
00:56:56,996 --> 00:56:59,487
I'm sorry, ma'am, we're closing.

547
00:57:00,833 --> 00:57:04,633
Please, I just-- I wanna know his name.

548
00:57:05,404 --> 00:57:10,603
To even consider re-establishing contact
with a child, there is a detailed process.

549
00:57:10,776 --> 00:57:15,440
I don't care about your process! Okay?

550
00:57:31,630 --> 00:57:36,124
Ma'am, we're closed.
Come back tomorrow.

551
00:57:39,672 --> 00:57:41,401
Lyla.

552
00:57:42,441 --> 00:57:43,908
Novacek.

553
00:57:46,846 --> 00:57:49,314
- Hi, this is Lyla--
- And Lizzy.

554
00:57:49,482 --> 00:57:52,542
And we're not here right now,
so leave a message.

555
00:58:12,772 --> 00:58:14,296
Arthur!

556
00:58:15,174 --> 00:58:17,404
What'd I tell you
about talking to strangers?

557
00:58:17,576 --> 00:58:21,034
- Yeah, what's your name?
- My name is Mr. Jeffries, and yours?

558
00:58:21,547 --> 00:58:23,777
Arthur. We ain't strangers now.

559
00:58:24,316 --> 00:58:28,514
Look, Mr. Wallace,
I'm here making my normal rounds.

560
00:58:28,687 --> 00:58:30,245
I'm trying to find these kids.

561
00:58:30,422 --> 00:58:33,653
This girl, her name is Geralda.
She should be about 14 now.

562
00:58:33,826 --> 00:58:35,259
Don't know her, Mr. Jeffries.

563
00:58:35,427 --> 00:58:38,453
Okay, well, maybe you can help me
with this young man.

564
00:58:38,631 --> 00:58:42,533
Little boy that came up missing recently
and his name is Evan Taylor.

565
00:58:43,369 --> 00:58:45,530
He's about 12.

566
00:58:47,673 --> 00:58:51,302
And what if I find this Evan
and I turn him over to you?

567
00:58:51,877 --> 00:58:55,779
What then? You don't care about a kid
after he's in the system.

568
00:58:55,948 --> 00:58:59,543
- It's not like that--
- Oh, I know exactly what it's like.

569
00:58:59,718 --> 00:59:03,711
You don't follow up.
And you throw him from place to place.

570
00:59:03,889 --> 00:59:07,484
Eventually, you end up in a place
where they kick the crap out of you.

571
00:59:07,927 --> 00:59:12,557
Go to bed at night
and he tries to close his eyes, ears.

572
00:59:12,731 --> 00:59:14,426
Shut out the world.

573
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:18,127
What happens to that kid?
What do you think he hears?

574
00:59:18,737 --> 00:59:20,432
What do you think he hears?

575
00:59:22,174 --> 00:59:24,301
- Nothing.
- Nothing. Nothing at all.

576
00:59:28,047 --> 00:59:29,173
Are you all right?

577
00:59:29,782 --> 00:59:31,340
- Yeah, I'm cool.
- He's good.

578
00:59:40,259 --> 00:59:42,318
Fourteenth Precinct, Sergeant O'Malley.

579
00:59:43,128 --> 00:59:46,495
No. That doesn't cut it.

580
00:59:48,267 --> 00:59:51,327
No! Oh, is that final?

581
00:59:51,503 --> 00:59:54,904
Okay, well, here's my final offer:
we're history!

582
00:59:55,941 --> 00:59:58,068
- Deal's off.
- But I wanna play.

583
00:59:58,244 --> 01:00:01,213
You play when I say play.
You breathe when I say breathe.

584
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:04,008
- You got that, boy?
- But I have to play.

585
01:00:04,183 --> 01:00:06,310
Wizard, I need them to hear.

586
01:00:06,485 --> 01:00:11,445
You forget about your parents!
They were pretty quick to forget about you.

587
01:00:17,296 --> 01:00:19,730
You don't know how it could be for you.

588
01:00:19,899 --> 01:00:22,732
You do not know how precious
your gift is.

589
01:00:22,902 --> 01:00:25,632
You're just a kid, you don't know.

590
01:00:30,376 --> 01:00:32,606
I do, August.

591
01:00:47,593 --> 01:00:49,823
- Wizard. Wizard.
- Talk to me. What happened?

592
01:00:49,995 --> 01:00:53,556
- It's Arthur. The cops chased him here.
- Okay, split up. You know the drill.

593
01:00:53,732 --> 01:00:56,223
- We gotta help Arty.
- Forget Arty. Arty's on his own.

594
01:00:56,402 --> 01:00:58,393
- That's the book.
- No.

595
01:00:58,570 --> 01:01:00,868
- August!
- Grab him. Grab him. There he goes.

596
01:01:01,874 --> 01:01:03,364
He went outside over there.

597
01:01:16,522 --> 01:01:19,855
Up there. You see him?
See him? Look, over there.

598
01:01:20,025 --> 01:01:21,856
- Hey, kid, don't move.
- Hey, you!

599
01:01:22,027 --> 01:01:24,587
Cops. Cops.

600
01:01:25,230 --> 01:01:27,289
Cops. Over here.

601
01:01:29,935 --> 01:01:32,665
Grab that kid over there.
Grab him, grab him.

602
01:01:39,345 --> 01:01:41,540
Listen, you can't let the cops catch you.

603
01:01:41,714 --> 01:01:44,114
If they do,
you don't tell them your real name...

604
01:01:44,283 --> 01:01:47,719
...because they'll send you right back
where you came from, you got that?

605
01:01:48,587 --> 01:01:49,952
I don't wanna lose you...

606
01:01:50,122 --> 01:01:52,488
...but if we get separated,
we meet at the arch.

607
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:56,257
Do not tell them your name.

608
01:01:56,428 --> 01:02:01,491
Hey, when I say run, you run, okay?

609
01:02:08,307 --> 01:02:09,501
Let me see your hands.

610
01:02:12,511 --> 01:02:16,743
- Run, August. Run, August. Run!
- Hey, kid.

611
01:02:27,559 --> 01:02:28,583
Hey, kid, stop.

612
01:02:35,067 --> 01:02:36,728
Open the door.

613
01:05:15,827 --> 01:05:17,920
- Hi.
- Hi.

614
01:05:18,430 --> 01:05:22,833
I know how this looks, you know.
I'm not crazy.

615
01:05:23,001 --> 01:05:26,095
Nobody thinks you're crazy.
What's your name?

616
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:28,501
Lyla Novacek.

617
01:05:28,674 --> 01:05:30,642
Well, it's like
the woman explained to you.

618
01:05:30,809 --> 01:05:33,369
- You fill out a couple forms--
- Six months, they said.

619
01:05:33,545 --> 01:05:36,912
I don't have six months for forms.

620
01:05:37,082 --> 01:05:39,175
Then I can't help you, then.

621
01:05:39,785 --> 01:05:42,845
Explain something to me now. Why now?

622
01:05:43,622 --> 01:05:47,319
Why not before? Why is it so important
that you want him now?

623
01:05:48,527 --> 01:05:50,722
I've always wanted him.

624
01:05:53,098 --> 01:05:57,000
I've waited 11 years, two months,
and 15 days...

625
01:05:57,936 --> 01:06:00,564
...to find out that he's alive.

626
01:06:03,642 --> 01:06:05,473
I've been counting.

627
01:06:22,327 --> 01:06:24,761
- Hi, this is Lyla--
- And Lizzy.

628
01:06:24,930 --> 01:06:27,899
And we're not here right now,
so leave a message.

629
01:06:48,086 --> 01:06:49,348
What are you waiting for?

630
01:06:49,521 --> 01:06:52,251
You see, I know this girl
that lives across the street.

631
01:06:52,424 --> 01:06:53,448
Lyla Novacek.

632
01:06:53,625 --> 01:06:55,718
I've been standing outside here waiting.

633
01:06:55,894 --> 01:06:57,259
I wrote her a song.

634
01:06:57,429 --> 01:07:00,887
Oh, the musician.
She keeps me up half the night.

635
01:07:01,066 --> 01:07:05,264
Well, I haven't seen her in a few days.
She's off on her honeymoon.

636
01:07:07,673 --> 01:07:09,402
Thanks.

637
01:07:50,215 --> 01:07:52,342
And this isn't your signature?

638
01:07:53,785 --> 01:07:58,654
You do realize that he's probably
already been placed with a family, correct?

639
01:07:58,824 --> 01:08:01,258
Do you have children, Mr. Jeffries?

640
01:08:09,067 --> 01:08:11,433
Yeah, I did.

641
01:08:13,305 --> 01:08:14,829
Then you know.

642
01:08:22,681 --> 01:08:23,943
What's his birthday?

643
01:08:24,583 --> 01:08:26,949
December 17th, 1995.

644
01:08:28,653 --> 01:08:29,813
Yeah, I know.

645
01:08:42,434 --> 01:08:44,595
Excuse me a minute.

646
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:14,526
This is him.

647
01:09:19,204 --> 01:09:20,728
Yeah.

648
01:10:00,479 --> 01:10:02,538
You the one slept under my bed?

649
01:10:07,853 --> 01:10:08,911
Do you live here?

650
01:10:09,521 --> 01:10:11,716
Me and my grandma do,
till our boat comes in.

651
01:10:14,926 --> 01:10:16,154
Do you like music?

652
01:10:17,696 --> 01:10:18,754
More than food.

653
01:10:21,933 --> 01:10:23,662
Do you know your notes?

654
01:10:25,003 --> 01:10:26,903
I've never seen them like that before.

655
01:10:27,072 --> 01:10:28,664
See here:

656
01:10:29,508 --> 01:10:34,411
"Every Good Boy Does Fine"
on the lines.

657
01:10:34,579 --> 01:10:39,983
And " F, A, C, E" in between.

658
01:10:40,151 --> 01:10:43,678
And "Great Big Dogs Fight Animals."

659
01:10:43,855 --> 01:10:48,815
And "All Cars Eat Gas." Get it?

660
01:10:49,761 --> 01:10:51,251
You're like an angel.

661
01:10:52,097 --> 01:10:53,826
Okay. I gotta go.

662
01:10:54,299 --> 01:10:55,994
Gotta go to school.

663
01:11:01,306 --> 01:11:03,035
Can I borrow this?

664
01:11:03,775 --> 01:11:05,436
Later.

665
01:12:32,964 --> 01:12:34,625
Holy....

666
01:12:37,902 --> 01:12:40,097
Reverend J.!

667
01:13:08,433 --> 01:13:11,231
You're not gonna believe this,
Reverend J. Come quick.

668
01:13:11,403 --> 01:13:14,304
- Slow down, Hope.
- You've gotta see what's happened.

669
01:13:35,293 --> 01:13:37,921
Remember in Music Appreciation
we had a class on Mozart?

670
01:13:38,096 --> 01:13:39,120
Yes.

671
01:13:39,297 --> 01:13:41,322
Remember you said
he was like a musical pod?

672
01:13:41,499 --> 01:13:43,433
- Prodigy.
- Exactly.

673
01:13:43,601 --> 01:13:46,502
Well, I have one of those,
and he's living under my bed.

674
01:13:54,779 --> 01:13:58,408
So I showed him the scales
and when I came home, he was....

675
01:14:31,116 --> 01:14:34,552
Mr. Jeffries, hi, it's Lyla Novacek again.

676
01:14:34,719 --> 01:14:37,552
I was just checking in.

677
01:14:40,024 --> 01:14:41,423
Right, I understand.

678
01:14:41,593 --> 01:14:44,721
You know,
if there's any more information or--

679
01:14:44,896 --> 01:14:46,727
Yeah, just call.

680
01:15:00,445 --> 01:15:02,106
I'll take it.

681
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:04,874
How long do you think you'll be staying?

682
01:15:05,917 --> 01:15:08,408
As long as it takes.

683
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:30,965
Sorry.

684
01:15:31,142 --> 01:15:33,838
I don 't know, Lizzy, it's like...

685
01:15:34,212 --> 01:15:36,043
...I just woke up...

686
01:15:36,214 --> 01:15:38,546
...and I should start playing again.

687
01:15:38,716 --> 01:15:40,616
I should play.

688
01:15:41,085 --> 01:15:44,418
I know it sounds crazy,
but maybe he 'll hear me.

689
01:16:00,538 --> 01:16:03,405
Hey, Marshall. It's me.

690
01:16:05,009 --> 01:16:06,874
I'm in New York.

691
01:16:08,580 --> 01:16:11,105
Is the band still minus
one mad Connelly brother?

692
01:16:12,150 --> 01:16:14,914
Having you guys here,
it'd be great, you know?

693
01:16:16,321 --> 01:16:17,686
Just an idea.

694
01:16:17,856 --> 01:16:20,654
Hey, Frank. It's Louis.

695
01:16:21,025 --> 01:16:22,856
Louis Connelly.

696
01:16:23,027 --> 01:16:24,460
And?

697
01:16:24,629 --> 01:16:27,120
I played here with me band
a couple of years ago.

698
01:16:27,298 --> 01:16:29,289
Well, about 10 years ago.

699
01:16:31,870 --> 01:16:34,236
Hey, hey, listen, Frank.

700
01:16:34,772 --> 01:16:38,264
I'm gonna play you one song, all right?
Just one song.

701
01:16:38,443 --> 01:16:42,072
And if you don't like it,
you can throw me out.

702
01:16:58,930 --> 01:17:01,228
You brought us a prodigy, Reverend.

703
01:17:01,399 --> 01:17:04,095
- He is a mystery.
- Here in the "Well-Tempered Clavier"....

704
01:17:04,269 --> 01:17:06,965
Dean, I thought he was an angel.

705
01:17:07,872 --> 01:17:11,137
There's no record of
an August Rush anywhere.

706
01:17:11,309 --> 01:17:15,746
It's about foundation,
starting with a very simple, orderly chord.

707
01:17:39,737 --> 01:17:42,331
Lyla, just relax.

708
01:17:42,507 --> 01:17:44,839
- This piece.
- You're pushing yourself too hard.

709
01:17:45,009 --> 01:17:47,273
I don't know if I can do this.

710
01:17:47,445 --> 01:17:49,970
You're playing with the Philharmonic.

711
01:17:50,148 --> 01:17:52,082
That's great.

712
01:17:53,985 --> 01:17:56,283
Okay, let's keep going.

713
01:18:03,594 --> 01:18:07,257
Start with a C-major chord,
then a modulation to G.

714
01:18:07,432 --> 01:18:10,424
Once we get to G,
we go back to C, very simple.

715
01:18:10,601 --> 01:18:13,365
And we have C, G, C.

716
01:18:21,079 --> 01:18:22,979
At the very beginning, C-major chord.

717
01:18:23,147 --> 01:18:27,743
We have this chaotic evolution
into a remote G-major.

718
01:18:31,089 --> 01:18:33,080
C-major chord, then move into a G.

719
01:18:41,899 --> 01:18:44,367
What' s this, August?

720
01:18:44,669 --> 01:18:46,864
The diminished fifth, sir.

721
01:18:47,238 --> 01:18:48,671
Key change here.

722
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:53,277
And then the rise with those round horns,
the oboes...

723
01:18:53,444 --> 01:18:55,844
...into the allegro staccato strings.

724
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:03,981
Mr. Rush.

725
01:19:07,458 --> 01:19:10,825
- I'm sorry.
- Why are you apologizing, August?

726
01:19:12,030 --> 01:19:13,497
Sometimes I don't listen well...

727
01:19:13,664 --> 01:19:16,132
...and I don't do the homework
like I'm supposed to.

728
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:18,598
Well, I'm sure you'll do better
in the future.

729
01:19:29,781 --> 01:19:32,773
The New York Philharmonic Orchestra
is having a concert.

730
01:19:33,418 --> 01:19:37,548
In the history of this school we have never
performed the work of a first-year student...

731
01:19:37,722 --> 01:19:40,623
...and certainly no one of your age.

732
01:19:40,792 --> 01:19:44,888
But now, we've asked them
if they could perform your rhapsody.

733
01:19:45,063 --> 01:19:46,621
Would you like that?

734
01:19:47,532 --> 01:19:50,000
Well, good. Good.

735
01:19:50,168 --> 01:19:51,829
How many people will hear it?

736
01:19:54,605 --> 01:19:58,371
Well, it would be performed in Central Park,
on the Great Lawn.

737
01:19:58,543 --> 01:19:59,567
A hundred?

738
01:20:00,745 --> 01:20:02,645
Much more. Thousands.

739
01:20:03,481 --> 01:20:08,043
Okay. Because I need to play it
to a lot of people. Lots and lots.

740
01:20:09,687 --> 01:20:11,348
We'll see what we can do to help.

741
01:20:15,093 --> 01:20:19,894
August, three artists will be performing
and you will be featured last.

742
01:20:31,109 --> 01:20:32,906
How do you do it?

743
01:20:33,311 --> 01:20:36,678
How does the music come to you?

744
01:20:38,816 --> 01:20:40,579
I just hear it.

745
01:20:44,522 --> 01:20:46,353
Sometimes I wake up and it's there...

746
01:20:46,524 --> 01:20:49,357
...or I hear it
when I'm walking down the street.

747
01:20:56,467 --> 01:20:59,027
It's like someone's calling out to me.

748
01:20:59,937 --> 01:21:02,599
Writing it all down
is like I'm calling back to them.

749
01:21:02,773 --> 01:21:04,035
Who?

750
01:21:05,543 --> 01:21:07,738
The ones who gave me the music.

751
01:21:15,086 --> 01:21:18,487
- You sure you're ready for this, Louis?
- Are you?

752
01:22:18,950 --> 01:22:20,474
Bravo, August!

753
01:22:23,020 --> 01:22:24,487
Good one!

754
01:22:27,925 --> 01:22:32,123
August, boy, you're a hard guy to find.

755
01:22:34,465 --> 01:22:35,955
Been looking everywhere for you.

756
01:22:36,133 --> 01:22:39,569
Excuse me.
You're interrupting a rehearsal here.

757
01:22:39,737 --> 01:22:42,297
- Yeah, rehearsal, right.
- And you are...?

758
01:22:42,473 --> 01:22:44,065
Come here to me, son.

759
01:22:53,851 --> 01:22:55,409
Come here.

760
01:22:58,522 --> 01:23:00,387
What'd they do to you?

761
01:23:01,993 --> 01:23:03,483
Nothing.

762
01:23:05,997 --> 01:23:07,988
These people can steal your soul.

763
01:23:08,833 --> 01:23:11,063
Sir, whomever you are,
you don't have the right.

764
01:23:11,235 --> 01:23:14,170
I'm his father, all right?
I have every right.

765
01:23:18,276 --> 01:23:21,040
I'll take you home now. Come on.

766
01:23:21,646 --> 01:23:24,740
But I have a concert. I like it here.

767
01:23:24,915 --> 01:23:27,440
- He's a remarkable boy--
- You don't think I know that?

768
01:23:27,618 --> 01:23:31,384
What'd you do, you just snatched him up
off the street? That gives you the right?

769
01:23:31,989 --> 01:23:34,253
Wait a moment,
we've been teaching him here.

770
01:23:34,425 --> 01:23:35,653
What are you gonna do?

771
01:23:35,826 --> 01:23:39,523
Fill his head with classical theory
and rules?

772
01:23:39,697 --> 01:23:42,666
You can't learn music from books.

773
01:23:42,833 --> 01:23:44,391
It's out there.

774
01:23:45,803 --> 01:23:48,169
You teach him?

775
01:23:48,606 --> 01:23:50,073
He teaches you.

776
01:23:50,241 --> 01:23:51,970
You learn from him.

777
01:23:52,143 --> 01:23:54,634
We are.
I assure you, Mr. Rush, every day.

778
01:23:55,780 --> 01:23:57,543
You should be with family. Come on.

779
01:24:00,951 --> 01:24:02,543
Mr. Rush, please.

780
01:24:02,720 --> 01:24:06,781
Do you have any idea of the importance
of the concert tomorrow night, for August?

781
01:24:07,591 --> 01:24:09,115
August. Wait, listen.

782
01:24:09,593 --> 01:24:12,460
You gotta tell me right now,
is this man really your father?

783
01:24:16,934 --> 01:24:18,765
You can tell me the truth.

784
01:24:19,937 --> 01:24:22,167
I know your real name.

785
01:24:23,341 --> 01:24:24,740
Evan.

786
01:24:25,343 --> 01:24:27,243
August.

787
01:24:27,411 --> 01:24:28,844
Evan.

788
01:24:31,248 --> 01:24:33,079
Is he your father?

789
01:24:37,588 --> 01:24:39,783
He taught me everything I know.

790
01:24:52,370 --> 01:24:54,031
And we are back, we are back.

791
01:24:57,875 --> 01:25:00,207
Don't make it harder for yourself, Aug.

792
01:25:00,378 --> 01:25:02,608
Wizard's not so bad.

793
01:25:03,881 --> 01:25:06,315
You saw the kid, right?
He's a freak of nature. Yeah.

794
01:25:06,484 --> 01:25:10,215
Here's the deal. Thousand a night, two
weeks minimum, three cities guaranteed.

795
01:25:10,388 --> 01:25:13,448
Then we ship him out to your partner
on the West Coast. No.

796
01:25:13,624 --> 01:25:15,489
He just ain't feeling well.

797
01:25:16,494 --> 01:25:19,793
He said you the only one
who gonna make him feel better.

798
01:25:26,904 --> 01:25:29,805
Competition. All right, I'll be back.
You do what you do.

799
01:25:33,711 --> 01:25:35,645
Yo, yo.

800
01:25:41,485 --> 01:25:44,147
I'm his representation.
That's why I'm making the deal.

801
01:25:44,989 --> 01:25:47,423
Come on. No, there's no parents.

802
01:26:17,688 --> 01:26:19,246
Great sounds, kid.

803
01:26:22,026 --> 01:26:23,618
Gibson J-200?

804
01:26:25,162 --> 01:26:26,629
It's beautiful.

805
01:26:27,231 --> 01:26:28,528
Can I see her?

806
01:26:31,969 --> 01:26:34,938
Hey. It's okay.

807
01:26:35,406 --> 01:26:37,465
I'm a musician too.

808
01:26:42,646 --> 01:26:44,170
Yeah.

809
01:26:48,252 --> 01:26:49,947
Oh, yeah.

810
01:27:03,567 --> 01:27:04,898
Nice action.

811
01:27:05,936 --> 01:27:07,267
You're pretty good.

812
01:27:08,472 --> 01:27:10,099
Thanks.

813
01:27:11,041 --> 01:27:13,032
See what you can do with mine.

814
01:29:07,524 --> 01:29:08,923
How long you been playing?

815
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:10,759
Six months.

816
01:29:11,395 --> 01:29:13,192
Six months?

817
01:29:13,364 --> 01:29:15,855
How'd you learn how to play like that
in six months?

818
01:29:16,033 --> 01:29:17,091
Juilliard.

819
01:29:18,736 --> 01:29:19,896
Juilliard?

820
01:29:20,404 --> 01:29:21,632
Yes, sir.

821
01:29:21,805 --> 01:29:23,773
I have my own concert tonight.

822
01:29:24,775 --> 01:29:26,436
Do you reckon I should believe you?

823
01:29:27,544 --> 01:29:30,206
Yeah. But I can't go.

824
01:29:30,648 --> 01:29:31,876
Why's that?

825
01:29:32,616 --> 01:29:34,982
It's kind of a long story.

826
01:29:37,321 --> 01:29:41,849
Well, if I went to Juilliard
and I had a concert tonight...

827
01:29:42,026 --> 01:29:43,926
...I wouldn't miss it for the world.

828
01:29:45,229 --> 01:29:46,662
Yeah.

829
01:29:51,835 --> 01:29:54,395
But what if something bad
would happen if you did it?

830
01:29:56,073 --> 01:29:58,268
You never quit on your music.

831
01:29:59,043 --> 01:30:01,136
No matter what happens.

832
01:30:01,745 --> 01:30:05,442
Because anytime
something bad happens to you...

833
01:30:05,849 --> 01:30:09,148
...it's the one place you can escape to
and just let it go.

834
01:30:11,288 --> 01:30:13,381
I learned that the hard way.

835
01:30:15,025 --> 01:30:16,925
And anyway, look at me.

836
01:30:17,961 --> 01:30:20,293
Nothing bad's gonna happen.

837
01:30:20,998 --> 01:30:23,125
You gotta have a little faith.

838
01:30:33,777 --> 01:30:35,005
I'm Louis.

839
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:38,480
Ev-- August.

840
01:30:38,649 --> 01:30:40,310
August Rush.

841
01:30:40,484 --> 01:30:42,543
August Rush.

842
01:30:43,954 --> 01:30:46,286
- Cool name.
- August!

843
01:30:47,624 --> 01:30:49,148
Come on!

844
01:30:52,229 --> 01:30:54,026
I gotta go, August.

845
01:31:00,337 --> 01:31:01,827
Bye.

846
01:31:02,606 --> 01:31:04,073
Yeah.

847
01:31:05,909 --> 01:31:07,399
Bye.

848
01:31:17,087 --> 01:31:18,486
Bye.

849
01:31:36,940 --> 01:31:39,670
Yes, I made him memorize our number.

850
01:31:42,246 --> 01:31:45,682
I understand. Your department's
doing everything they can.

851
01:32:04,668 --> 01:32:07,228
Do you think anything bad
happened to him?

852
01:32:08,338 --> 01:32:09,600
I'm sure he's fine.

853
01:32:10,674 --> 01:32:13,234
I prayed for him. Did you?

854
01:32:14,011 --> 01:32:15,672
Yeah.

855
01:32:16,847 --> 01:32:23,548
Well, if his father loves him like he should,
then he'll do what's best for his son.

856
01:32:25,455 --> 01:32:27,082
You believe that, don't you?

857
01:32:28,058 --> 01:32:30,856
- Yeah.
- Good.

858
01:32:31,161 --> 01:32:33,026
Now go get ready.

859
01:32:44,007 --> 01:32:46,441
Welcome to our Concert in the Park...

860
01:32:46,910 --> 01:32:51,973
...and the Mercedes Drive Your Future
Scholarship Celebration.

861
01:32:52,149 --> 01:32:54,811
And now it is with enormous pleasure...

862
01:32:54,985 --> 01:33:01,618
...that I welcome back to the concert stage
one of Juilliard's own, Lyla Novacek.

863
01:35:06,049 --> 01:35:07,778
I have to go now.

864
01:35:19,696 --> 01:35:21,493
I'm not coming back this time.

865
01:35:23,133 --> 01:35:24,464
He's just kidding, Wizard.

866
01:35:26,069 --> 01:35:28,799
Me and August have a understanding.
Don't we?

867
01:35:33,944 --> 01:35:36,139
Aug, you can't leave me, man.

868
01:35:36,313 --> 01:35:38,076
Yes, I can.

869
01:35:39,316 --> 01:35:41,443
Because you have to
find your parents, right?

870
01:35:41,618 --> 01:35:44,382
Yeah. My concert's starting.

871
01:35:44,554 --> 01:35:49,617
Well, all my money's on the fact
your folks won't be able to find you.

872
01:35:49,793 --> 01:35:51,124
You know why?

873
01:35:51,528 --> 01:35:53,428
Because they can't hear you.

874
01:35:53,864 --> 01:35:55,195
They're probably dead.

875
01:35:55,365 --> 01:35:57,560
You're not going anywhere.

876
01:36:09,780 --> 01:36:10,838
Nowhere to go, son.

877
01:36:21,892 --> 01:36:23,655
Run, boy.

878
01:36:23,827 --> 01:36:25,351
Run, August, run.

879
01:36:46,483 --> 01:36:48,951
August!

880
01:37:39,069 --> 01:37:41,594
August!

881
01:38:01,958 --> 01:38:04,586
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

882
01:38:04,961 --> 01:38:10,763
Music has always fascinated us
in the way that it communicates.

883
01:38:10,934 --> 01:38:13,960
Without words, without pictures.

884
01:38:14,871 --> 01:38:17,738
And that leads us
to our final performance.

885
01:38:21,912 --> 01:38:24,073
How much longer to the airport?

886
01:38:24,247 --> 01:38:26,738
Man, it jams up the traffic.

887
01:38:26,917 --> 01:38:29,408
Bring you back to the old days,
eh, Louis?

888
01:38:47,137 --> 01:38:48,934
"August Rush."

889
01:38:49,105 --> 01:38:50,936
Evan Taylor.

890
01:39:06,656 --> 01:39:11,320
Unfortunately, our last performer
seems to have....

891
01:39:11,494 --> 01:39:14,361
He's here. He's here. He's here.

892
01:39:15,765 --> 01:39:16,857
Excellent.

893
01:39:17,033 --> 01:39:23,962
Perhaps there's no one else who can
better personify the mystery that is music...

894
01:39:24,140 --> 01:39:26,870
...than our final composer.

895
01:41:18,621 --> 01:41:20,111
Hey, what's that?

896
01:41:20,290 --> 01:41:22,884
Concerts in the Park every spring.

897
01:41:50,620 --> 01:41:52,281
Let me out.

898
01:41:53,490 --> 01:41:55,890
Let me out! Let me out!

899
01:46:39,108 --> 01:46:41,633
The music is all around us.

900
01:46:41,811 --> 01:46:45,440
All you have to do is listen.

901
01:52:26,889 --> 01:52:30,518
Bamba, bamba

902
01:52:31,394 --> 01:52:34,886
Oh, bamba, bamba

903
01:52:35,064 --> 01:52:37,123
Para bailar la bamba

904
01:52:37,299 --> 01:52:40,132
Bamba, bamba

905
01:52:40,302 --> 01:52:43,362
- Para bailar la bamba
- Bamba, bamba

906
01:52:43,539 --> 01:52:48,909
Se necesita una poca de gracia

907
01:52:49,078 --> 01:52:50,511
Bamba, bamba

908
01:52:50,679 --> 01:52:55,742
Una poca de gracia pa mi pa ti

909
01:52:55,918 --> 01:52:58,386
Y arriba, y arriba

910
01:52:58,554 --> 01:53:00,954
Bamba, bamba

911
01:53:01,123 --> 01:53:03,318
Yeah, dance with me, baby

912
01:53:03,492 --> 01:53:04,550
Bamba, bamba

913
01:53:04,727 --> 01:53:06,422
Let's dance tonight

914
01:53:06,595 --> 01:53:08,859
Say arriba, y arriba

915
01:53:09,031 --> 01:53:11,693
Bamba, bamba

916
01:53:11,867 --> 01:53:14,062
Say arriba, y arriba

917
01:53:14,236 --> 01:53:16,602
Bamba, bamba

918
01:53:22,178 --> 01:53:23,975
Yeah, yeah, yeah

919
01:53:32,822 --> 01:53:34,813
