365
00:27:27,515 --> 00:27:29,125
You know you can, you pull it
out.

366
00:27:29,169 --> 00:27:30,387
Please, I'm begging you, Pa.

367
00:27:30,431 --> 00:27:31,780
Pull it out, boy.

368
00:27:33,434 --> 00:27:34,565
You take it out.

369
00:27:34,609 --> 00:27:36,480
You get over here and you
take it out.

370
00:27:37,177 --> 00:27:38,569
You take it out now.

371
00:27:38,613 --> 00:27:41,311
It's not time for you to be
no sissy boy.

372
00:27:41,572 --> 00:27:42,878
You take it out now.

373
00:27:42,922 --> 00:27:44,445
You show me you're a man.

374
00:27:45,576 --> 00:27:47,100
Show me how you do it.

375
00:27:47,927 --> 00:27:50,320
Show me how you ride that
bicycle.

376
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:53,193
And I want you to go real slow,

377
00:27:54,368 --> 00:27:56,196
and you let me see how it's
done,

378
00:27:57,458 --> 00:27:59,242
and you make me proud.

379
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:04,160
[Thomas masturbating]

380
00:28:09,339 --> 00:28:11,385
Yeah, that's right, that's
right.

381
00:28:13,604 --> 00:28:15,998
Yeah, look at them dirty
pillows.

382
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:17,695
Oh yeah.

383
00:28:18,653 --> 00:28:20,046
[Thomas moans]

384
00:28:20,307 --> 00:28:22,396
All right, now slow down,
slow down.

385
00:28:22,439 --> 00:28:23,832
Don't go too fast.

386
00:28:24,528 --> 00:28:25,528
Take it easy.

387
00:28:26,792 --> 00:28:29,229
Take it easy, I want to see
how you do it.

388
00:28:29,925 --> 00:28:32,841
[Thomas grunting]

389
00:28:32,885 --> 00:28:35,626
All right now, you finish
up and get it done.

390
00:28:36,236 --> 00:28:40,675
God is watching you right now
and you a sinner in his eyes.

391
00:28:41,676 --> 00:28:44,766
You got to atone and
you're going to have to atone,

392
00:28:45,027 --> 00:28:46,942
and we're gonna walk
down that path together,

393
00:28:46,986 --> 00:28:48,248
for your mother.

394
00:28:48,639 --> 00:28:50,076
Your mama love you.

395
00:28:50,337 --> 00:28:51,817
And you finish up, boy.

396
00:28:56,691 --> 00:28:58,171
You finish up, get it done!

397
00:28:58,432 --> 00:29:01,000
[Thomas crying]

398
00:29:13,882 --> 00:29:16,580
[ominous music]

399
00:29:52,051 --> 00:29:54,705
The light that appeared
with your mother,

400
00:29:55,489 --> 00:29:58,579
say there's something
else needs to be doing.

401
00:29:59,841 --> 00:30:02,844
Says I need to wait till dark
to tell ya.

402
00:30:05,107 --> 00:30:06,805
It's dark now.

403
00:30:07,893 --> 00:30:10,373
No man or woman judges.

404
00:30:13,072 --> 00:30:15,857
God's got something he wants
done, boy.

405
00:30:18,468 --> 00:30:21,036
[lively music]

406
00:30:23,865 --> 00:30:26,520
[woman moaning]

407
00:30:39,533 --> 00:30:42,057
[lively music]

408
00:31:34,675 --> 00:31:37,330
[radio busting]

409
00:31:44,293 --> 00:31:45,947
I liked that song.

410
00:31:50,125 --> 00:31:52,214
You could've just unplugged it.

411
00:31:52,258 --> 00:31:54,260
You got that thing you said
you got?

412
00:32:02,877 --> 00:32:05,401
Careful with that,
it ain't been cut yet.

413
00:32:06,011 --> 00:32:08,187
That'll drop an elephant as is.

414
00:32:10,015 --> 00:32:12,713
Kind of makes you a
prostitute, doesn't it?

415
00:32:13,583 --> 00:32:15,934
There are worse things to be.

416
00:32:16,673 --> 00:32:18,937
Do you even remember my
name, lover?

417
00:32:19,981 --> 00:32:21,374
Yeah, it's Jenny.

418
00:32:23,332 --> 00:32:24,332
It ain't.

419
00:32:37,694 --> 00:32:40,349
[motor humming]

420
00:32:56,235 --> 00:32:57,235
Shit.

421
00:33:05,853 --> 00:33:07,550
You a couple weeks early!

422
00:33:07,594 --> 00:33:10,292
Well, I like to stay sociable.

423
00:33:15,123 --> 00:33:16,820
Breakfast of champions.

424
00:33:20,433 --> 00:33:22,304
Hooch ain't why you're here.

425
00:33:23,784 --> 00:33:24,784
Get up.

426
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,920
Turn around.

427
00:33:31,966 --> 00:33:34,142
Put 'em together like you're
praying.

428
00:33:36,144 --> 00:33:37,841
All right, easy now.

429
00:33:37,885 --> 00:33:38,885
Come on.

430
00:33:40,888 --> 00:33:41,888
God damn.

431
00:33:53,509 --> 00:33:56,208
Nine year old girl
went missing last week.

432
00:33:57,078 --> 00:33:59,037
Little ways outside of Austin.

433
00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:02,170
Well this ain't a little
ways outside Austin.

434
00:34:02,214 --> 00:34:03,737
It's close enough.

435
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,521
You're on my list.

436
00:34:07,219 --> 00:34:09,873
You know anything about a
nine year old girl gone missing?

437
00:34:14,748 --> 00:34:15,879
The only thing I know

438
00:34:15,923 --> 00:34:17,577
is you're gonna make me late
for work.

439
00:34:19,709 --> 00:34:22,060
Life ain't hard enough for you?

440
00:34:23,017 --> 00:34:26,803
Words out that you're gambling
again and you're in deep.

441
00:34:27,326 --> 00:34:28,849
Drinking, whoring.

442
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:33,723
How many violations you think
I need to put you back inside?

443
00:34:34,289 --> 00:34:36,204
The answer is none.

444
00:34:36,944 --> 00:34:40,948
I get one crooked hair up
my ass and you are done.

445
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,038
You know, I got some
Prep H inside the trailer,

446
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,953
you can help yourself.

447
00:34:46,171 --> 00:34:47,389
You're funny.

448
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:50,131
Don't worry about being late
for work.

449
00:34:50,175 --> 00:34:52,699
I had a talk with your boss,
man.

450
00:34:52,742 --> 00:34:55,658
He was all sorts of unaware
about you being a nonce.

451
00:34:56,181 --> 00:34:57,225
That's what I called it.

452
00:34:57,269 --> 00:34:58,574
He didn't know what it was.

453
00:34:58,835 --> 00:35:00,098
So I explained to him,

454
00:35:00,141 --> 00:35:01,640
that's what they call
child fuckers in prison.

455
00:35:01,664 --> 00:35:03,927
That girl was 16, she's
boozing up in a bar.

456
00:35:03,971 --> 00:35:05,407
She told me otherwise.

457
00:35:05,451 --> 00:35:06,971
You wouldn't know it by
looking at her.

458
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,019
All that, that was five years
ago.

459
00:35:09,063 --> 00:35:10,369
I did my time for that.

460
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,632
Come on, you know that.

461
00:35:13,067 --> 00:35:14,808
Only thing I know is a
crossed line

462
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,072
is awfully hard to step back
over.

463
00:35:21,945 --> 00:35:23,512
You best go toss it.

464
00:35:24,209 --> 00:35:26,211
Oh yes, sir, I'll do that.

465
00:35:28,082 --> 00:35:32,521
You move an inch off your
throne, I'll shoot you dead.

466
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Nonce.

467
00:35:35,089 --> 00:35:37,744
[ominous music]

468
00:35:56,719 --> 00:35:59,113
- Hey.
- [upbeat country music]

469
00:36:01,028 --> 00:36:01,985
Here to see Boone.

470
00:36:02,029 --> 00:36:03,683
Logan ain't seeing you, Eli.

471
00:36:04,988 --> 00:36:07,208
I don't need Logan, I
want to talk to Boone.

472
00:36:07,643 --> 00:36:09,384
Well, you know this.

473
00:36:09,428 --> 00:36:11,778
You want to see Boone,
you gotta go through Logan.

474
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,216
[Billy] Let me check.

475
00:36:16,261 --> 00:36:19,046
Hey Logan, Eli's here to see
Boone.

476
00:36:19,699 --> 00:36:21,259
[Logan] Tell him to fuck
himself, Billy?

477
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,354
[Billy] He says go fuck
yourself, Eli.

478
00:36:22,397 --> 00:36:24,138
Hey, I got, I got money.

479
00:36:24,965 --> 00:36:26,271
He says, he's got money.

480
00:36:26,314 --> 00:36:27,857
[Logan] Yeah, he always
says he's got money.

481
00:36:27,881 --> 00:36:29,491
Tell him to fuck himself, Billy.

482
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:31,450
He seems resound, Eli.

483
00:36:31,493 --> 00:36:33,495
Know what man, I'm fucking,
fuck you.

484
00:36:33,539 --> 00:36:34,627
I'm not doing this shit.

485
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:35,976
Hey, you fucking dope.

486
00:36:36,019 --> 00:36:38,239
[Billy laughs]

487
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,154
Shit.

488
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,374
[gun cocking]

489
00:36:43,897 --> 00:36:45,725
[Boone] Put it away.

490
00:36:49,424 --> 00:36:51,644
You boys done blowing each
other?

491
00:36:52,993 --> 00:36:54,429
[Logan] Eli wants to see you.

492
00:36:54,473 --> 00:36:55,473
No shit.

493
00:36:56,953 --> 00:36:58,520
Come on then, hey, come on.

494
00:37:03,264 --> 00:37:04,439
God damn it, man.

495
00:37:04,483 --> 00:37:06,659
Can't make a bloody
Mary to save your life.

496
00:37:07,442 --> 00:37:09,531
You're the only one that
drinks them.

497
00:37:14,928 --> 00:37:16,277
Have a seat, Eli.

498
00:37:20,325 --> 00:37:22,457
I apologize Sheriff, where
were we?

499
00:37:24,372 --> 00:37:26,461
Oh, he's no bother.

500
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:31,814
Eli, I'm gonna give the
Sheriff here

501
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,034
an envelope full of money.

502
00:37:35,078 --> 00:37:36,491
There's a little bit
extra in there, Sheriff,

503
00:37:36,515 --> 00:37:38,081
on account of your anniversary.

504
00:37:40,432 --> 00:37:42,042
Sheriff's been married 40 years.

505
00:37:42,608 --> 00:37:43,608
God bless.

506
00:37:47,656 --> 00:37:49,615
Sheriff, always a pleasure.

507
00:37:54,315 --> 00:37:55,360
Eli, is it?

508
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:10,592
You owe me money,
of the substantial variety.

509
00:38:26,086 --> 00:38:27,609
Four hundred and eighty dollars?

510
00:38:28,001 --> 00:38:29,916
You're in for a mess more
than that.

511
00:38:32,832 --> 00:38:35,748
Forgot, you know, I got
something else.

512
00:38:43,016 --> 00:38:44,365
That ain't even been cut yet.

513
00:38:45,105 --> 00:38:47,847
That's worth two grand, at
least.

514
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:50,066
[Boone] You just toss smack
on my desk?

515
00:38:53,156 --> 00:38:56,072
Did you just toss smack on my
desk?

516
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:59,380
Do I have to ask the
fucking question again?

517
00:39:02,122 --> 00:39:03,122
All right.

518
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,304
I'm gonna have you killed, Eli.

519
00:39:11,131 --> 00:39:12,219
Dead and buried.

520
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,633
And there won't be a soul
in the world who'll give a shit.

521
00:39:15,657 --> 00:39:16,702
I'll work it off.

522
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,791
I'll work off the debt.

523
00:39:18,834 --> 00:39:19,922
I'll tend bar.

524
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,553
I'll even clean the shitters,
you know, I'll do...

525
00:39:22,577 --> 00:39:24,753
You want me to put you on
the payroll?

526
00:39:25,798 --> 00:39:26,973
Well you might as well start

527
00:39:27,016 --> 00:39:29,062
by hitting me in the dick
with a hammer.

528
00:39:29,105 --> 00:39:30,803
'Cause that'd be about as
appealing to me.

529
00:39:30,846 --> 00:39:31,543
I'll get it.

530
00:39:31,586 --> 00:39:32,631
I'll get you the money.

531
00:39:34,023 --> 00:39:36,243
Forgetting immediate
unpleasantries committed,

532
00:39:36,286 --> 00:39:38,027
you getting me my money

533
00:39:38,288 --> 00:39:40,421
is the general nature of the
conversation

534
00:39:40,465 --> 00:39:41,509
we're about to have.

535
00:39:46,471 --> 00:39:48,298
You ever hear of Romani.

536
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,300
Gypsies.

537
00:39:52,651 --> 00:39:57,177
From Germany, Romania,
wherever, over there.

538
00:40:00,006 --> 00:40:03,052
Most come after the second
World War.

539
00:40:04,924 --> 00:40:07,230
Jews got the bum wrap, sure,

540
00:40:07,753 --> 00:40:13,236
but Hitler's boys, they killed
communists and radicals.

541
00:40:13,889 --> 00:40:16,544
Gimps, retards and queers.

542
00:40:16,588 --> 00:40:20,896
Generally anyone they
disagreed with, or couldn't trust.

543
00:40:21,636 --> 00:40:24,378
Gypsies being part of that
congregation.

544
00:40:25,858 --> 00:40:28,861
You know why Nazis pulled Jew
teeth?

545
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:32,995
'Cause Jew teeth had gold
fillings,

546
00:40:33,866 --> 00:40:35,824
and them Nazis took their share.

547
00:40:36,216 --> 00:40:38,305
Little here, a little there.

548
00:40:39,393 --> 00:40:42,004
Bunch of gold adds up over
the years.

549
00:40:45,791 --> 00:40:48,707
Them Gypsies comes
through these parts each year,

550
00:40:49,272 --> 00:40:50,535
with a carnival.

551
00:40:51,057 --> 00:40:54,408
They pitch their tents and
then move on.

552
00:40:56,323 --> 00:40:57,977
And this part of the story

553
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:00,414
is the part you best pay
attention to,

554
00:41:00,849 --> 00:41:02,460
'cause it's a fact, Jack.

555
00:41:02,503 --> 00:41:04,940
[tense music]

556
00:41:07,421 --> 00:41:10,250
A week back, a man sat
downstairs,

557
00:41:11,294 --> 00:41:13,296
got himself drunk at my bar.

558
00:41:14,036 --> 00:41:16,474
Kept going on about them
Gypsies.

559
00:41:17,213 --> 00:41:18,954
Said he was one of those Romani.

560
00:41:19,607 --> 00:41:21,653
Told that tale about Jew gold,

561
00:41:22,523 --> 00:41:25,308
and how this clan, these
carnies,

562
00:41:25,613 --> 00:41:27,963
were sitting on 10 bars of it.

563
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:29,704
Said for the right price,

564
00:41:29,748 --> 00:41:31,532
he might know where they
stash it.

565
00:41:34,187 --> 00:41:35,928
They pitch their carnival tents

566
00:41:35,971 --> 00:41:40,410
on a lot I got down by the
rail yard, just outside Odessa.

567
00:41:42,151 --> 00:41:43,718
You're goin' with Logan and
Billy

568
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,286
to see if that gold story's
true.

569
00:41:48,941 --> 00:41:50,159
You gotta be shittin' me.

570
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,467
I got all sorts of friends

571
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,904
collecting all sorts of
envelopes.

572
00:41:57,297 --> 00:41:58,559
Clear your markers.

573
00:41:59,778 --> 00:42:01,910
Have that record of yours
wiped clean.

574
00:42:03,172 --> 00:42:04,522
New start for you.

575
00:42:07,263 --> 00:42:09,178
Or I kill you right here and
now.

576
00:42:14,183 --> 00:42:15,228
Gypsies, huh?

577
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:16,751
Go figure.

578
00:42:18,448 --> 00:42:19,537
Three of you,

579
00:42:21,016 --> 00:42:24,498
going over to Odessa,
coming back with Jew gold.

580
00:42:25,717 --> 00:42:26,979
You fuck it up,

581
00:42:28,371 --> 00:42:30,896
those two gonna take another
initiative.

582
00:42:32,637 --> 00:42:35,074
[tense music]

583
00:43:19,684 --> 00:43:21,599
They say if a dog howls for
no reason,

584
00:43:21,642 --> 00:43:22,991
there's trouble coming.

585
00:43:26,908 --> 00:43:27,908
Gypsy lore.

586
00:43:32,305 --> 00:43:33,436
[thunder roaring]

587
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:37,615
Lightening without rain,
these are omens.

588
00:43:39,225 --> 00:43:40,835
That's just heat lightening.

589
00:43:41,444 --> 00:43:42,444
Yeah?

590
00:43:42,576 --> 00:43:43,576
Well,

591
00:43:44,796 --> 00:43:47,450
I find it best to be
educated, so let's see.

592
00:43:49,017 --> 00:43:50,628
They navigate by moonlight.

593
00:43:50,845 --> 00:43:52,847
If it's obscured, they stay put.

594
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:56,198
They never get married
if a shoe falls out of a tree,

595
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:58,897
and crows are bad luck.

596
00:43:59,941 --> 00:44:01,203
They put a curse on everything.

597
00:44:01,726 --> 00:44:03,641
How would a shoe fall from
a tree?

598
00:44:04,903 --> 00:44:06,402
Well, it must have
happened at some point

599
00:44:06,426 --> 00:44:08,143
if they're deciding
something like marriage on it.

600
00:44:08,167 --> 00:44:10,691
Whoop-de fucking do, are
we gonna do this shit or what?

601
00:44:11,257 --> 00:44:12,562
What are we waiting for?

602
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:15,696
All right, tenderfoot.

603
00:44:17,698 --> 00:44:21,310
Now remember, we go in,
we have a few drinks,

604
00:44:21,571 --> 00:44:23,617
then Logan and I will close
out the tab.

605
00:44:24,052 --> 00:44:26,576
Now this is their last night,
so they're gonna be partying.

606
00:44:26,838 --> 00:44:28,622
As soon as they're good and
sauced up,

607
00:44:28,927 --> 00:44:30,842
Logan and I will go after the
gold,

608
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:32,321
you keep them distracted.

609
00:44:33,192 --> 00:44:34,367
You know where it's at?

610
00:44:35,498 --> 00:44:37,457
Well that's none of your
business, Eli.

611
00:44:38,023 --> 00:44:40,460
You ain't gotta do shit but
sit, drink,

612
00:44:40,765 --> 00:44:42,505
and entertain the pretty girls.

613
00:44:42,549 --> 00:44:43,855
That's all we need from you.

614
00:44:44,899 --> 00:44:45,899
Can you do that?

615
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:50,557
[lively Romani music]

616
00:45:04,005 --> 00:45:07,835
[singing in foreign language]

617
00:45:26,071 --> 00:45:28,421
[Marco] I thought it was
the beer. [Laughs]

618
00:45:29,465 --> 00:45:30,771
- Howdy.
- Hey.

619
00:45:30,815 --> 00:45:32,077
We're looking for Marco.

620
00:45:33,643 --> 00:45:34,644
Boone's guys.

621
00:45:34,993 --> 00:45:35,993
[Billy] That's right.

622
00:45:38,518 --> 00:45:39,518
Come on in.

623
00:45:44,219 --> 00:45:45,655
Welcome, gentlemen.

624
00:45:45,699 --> 00:45:47,745
Eh, a little fiesta before
we leave town tomorrow.

625
00:45:47,788 --> 00:45:49,485
[Billy] Yeah, this is great.

626
00:45:50,835 --> 00:45:51,835
You guys want beer?

627
00:45:52,053 --> 00:45:53,272
- Beer?
- Please.

628
00:45:53,315 --> 00:45:55,404
Towne, beer for everyone,
please, come on.

629
00:45:59,147 --> 00:46:00,148
So you're Marco.

630
00:46:00,192 --> 00:46:01,323
I am, yes.

631
00:46:02,063 --> 00:46:03,258
So you're having a little party?

632
00:46:03,282 --> 00:46:03,978
Oh yeah.

633
00:46:04,022 --> 00:46:05,022
[Logan] Take a seat.

634
00:46:05,458 --> 00:46:08,374
[people chattering]

635
00:46:08,417 --> 00:46:09,767
[Billy] Is that your sister?

636
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:10,942
No no no no.

637
00:46:11,246 --> 00:46:15,816
Dude, watch out.
[men laughing]

638
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:17,296
[Marco] Here we go, come on,
Towne.

639
00:46:18,863 --> 00:46:19,863
There we go.

640
00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:21,711
- Everybody get a beer.
- Thank you.

641
00:46:21,735 --> 00:46:23,095
Follow me in the back,
gentlemen.

642
00:46:25,173 --> 00:46:27,436
Whoa [laughs] Eli!

643
00:46:29,047 --> 00:46:30,657
- You're cute.
- Eli, I'll be back.

644
00:46:31,527 --> 00:46:32,746
Got my eye on you.

645
00:46:37,272 --> 00:46:42,277
[lively music]
[people clapping]

646
00:47:19,314 --> 00:47:20,554
Can I help you with something?

647
00:47:26,669 --> 00:47:27,845
What are you doing here?

648
00:47:30,543 --> 00:47:31,761
Doing some business.

649
00:47:35,330 --> 00:47:36,679
Just doing some business.

650
00:47:37,811 --> 00:47:38,811
That's it.

651
00:47:39,726 --> 00:47:40,726
Yeah.

652
00:47:41,075 --> 00:47:42,075
Good.

653
00:47:44,644 --> 00:47:45,644
That's good.

654
00:47:52,652 --> 00:47:54,349
What's your fucking
problem, huh?

655
00:47:58,832 --> 00:48:01,443
[Gina] Roy Roy, Marco wants
to see you.

656
00:48:06,144 --> 00:48:06,753
[hand smacking]

657
00:48:06,796 --> 00:48:07,796
Now!

658
00:48:21,289 --> 00:48:24,902
Sorry about that, he's
kind of a bad drunk.

659
00:48:25,163 --> 00:48:26,251
Here, please.

660
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:36,261
I already got one.

661
00:48:39,003 --> 00:48:40,003
Thank you.

662
00:48:41,222 --> 00:48:42,222
I'm Gina.

663
00:48:43,181 --> 00:48:44,181
Hey.

664
00:48:45,835 --> 00:48:47,620
Where'd you learn to dance
like that?

665
00:48:49,013 --> 00:48:50,666
It's very traditional in my
culture.

666
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:51,929
Taught very young.

667
00:48:53,713 --> 00:48:54,801
I never seen it before.

668
00:48:55,106 --> 00:48:57,543
- Maybe you'll have to try.
- [giggles]

669
00:48:58,457 --> 00:48:59,675
I could teach.

670
00:49:01,155 --> 00:49:03,157
I don't think I could
ever learn to do that,

671
00:49:04,637 --> 00:49:07,640
hand, you know, whatever
that was, the leg shaking stuff.

672
00:49:08,815 --> 00:49:10,251
I'd love to see you do this.

673
00:49:12,601 --> 00:49:13,689
So what are you doing here?

674
00:49:15,604 --> 00:49:16,997
Just finishing up some business.

675
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:20,609
With uh, whatever, boss man
is in there.

676
00:49:23,438 --> 00:49:26,006
Did you get a chance to
take part in the festivities?

677
00:49:27,703 --> 00:49:28,703
No.

678
00:49:29,792 --> 00:49:32,012
Shame, we leave tomorrow.

679
00:49:34,754 --> 00:49:36,274
Maybe I'll catch you on the
next one.

680
00:49:37,278 --> 00:49:38,279
All right.

681
00:49:47,506 --> 00:49:49,290
Ever seen a medium before?

682
00:49:50,944 --> 00:49:51,944
What?

683
00:49:52,598 --> 00:49:53,816
Fortune teller.

684
00:49:55,775 --> 00:49:56,645
Oh no, no.

685
00:49:56,689 --> 00:49:58,169
I, I don't have much fortune.

686
00:49:58,212 --> 00:49:59,387
I don't think.

687
00:50:00,171 --> 00:50:01,650
Well this one's special.

688
00:50:04,566 --> 00:50:07,134
I'm not a talker, you know?

689
00:50:07,178 --> 00:50:08,570
That's, that's what it is.

690
00:50:08,614 --> 00:50:10,355
It's good to know, I like that.

691
00:50:15,142 --> 00:50:16,839
What are we doing here?

692
00:50:16,883 --> 00:50:18,624
What's your name, handsome?

693
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:21,496
What are we doing here?

694
00:50:22,541 --> 00:50:23,585
I don't know yet.

695
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:26,216
But I don't know one
shouldn't pass up a reading

696
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,415
if she's willing.

697
00:50:27,937 --> 00:50:29,678
And that this is our last night.

698
00:50:30,244 --> 00:50:32,594
And I don't know anything
about you.

699
00:50:37,208 --> 00:50:38,208
James.

700
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:40,211
Mr. James.

701
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:43,301
I'll be right back.

702
00:50:49,524 --> 00:50:51,309
What am I doing here?

703
00:50:57,184 --> 00:50:58,184
[Gina] Have a seat.

704
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:01,493
[eerie music]

705
00:51:22,296 --> 00:51:23,428
Are you serious?

706
00:51:27,301 --> 00:51:31,044
[speaking in foreign language]

707
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:33,307
Give her your hand.

708
00:51:35,222 --> 00:51:37,311
[speaking in foreign language]

709
00:51:44,884 --> 00:51:46,146
[speaking in foreign language]

710
00:51:47,756 --> 00:51:49,541
Says you're easy on the eyes.

711
00:51:54,415 --> 00:51:55,764
[speaking in foreign language]

712
00:52:03,032 --> 00:52:04,232
[speaking in foreign language]

713
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:07,515
You're impatient.

714
00:52:09,778 --> 00:52:14,479
[speaking in foreign language]

715
00:52:15,523 --> 00:52:18,047

[speaking in foreign language]

717
00:52:21,703 --> 00:52:24,141
You've come through quick
hardship.

718
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:26,795
You keep secrets.

719
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:28,840
A burden.

720
00:52:31,757 --> 00:52:33,498
My hands are scarred from work.

721
00:52:34,629 --> 00:52:38,590
Skin's leather from the sun
and everybody keeps secrets.

722
00:52:39,852 --> 00:52:41,264
Should've pulled out that

that was for me tonight?

You're right.

punish you.

1083
01:22:23,416 --> 01:22:24,635
And you always have.

1084
01:22:27,377 --> 01:22:29,814
But please don't ever assume

1085
01:22:29,857 --> 01:22:32,251
that you know what a
child will mean to me.

[ominous music]

1088
01:22:59,148 --> 01:23:00,148
- Hi.

1089
01:23:03,152 --> 01:23:04,152

[knife slicing]

1091
01:23:07,895 --> 01:23:10,333
No it's, it's fine.

1092
01:23:10,376 --> 01:23:11,899
It's not your fault.

1093
01:23:16,252 --> 01:23:18,906
[knife slicing]

1094
01:23:23,302 --> 01:23:25,000
Don't you ever get mad?

1095

[ominous music]

1096
01:23:26,914 --> 01:23:28,829
Don't you ever get mad?

1097
01:23:30,744 --> 01:23:32,050
Don't you ever get mad?

[knife slicing]

1099
01:23:33,312 --> 01:23:35,053
Don't you ever get mad?

[Mary screaming]

1103
01:23:41,886 --> 01:23:42,713
Baby, come on.

1104
01:23:42,756 --> 01:23:43,627
Mary, oh no no.

1105
01:23:43,670 --> 01:23:45,063
No no no no no.

1106
01:23:45,107 --> 01:23:45,890
It's a dream.

1107
01:23:45,933 --> 01:23:46,717
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary.

1108
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:47,631
[Mary panicking]

1109
01:23:47,674 --> 01:23:48,849
Wake up, wake up, wake up.

1110
01:23:48,893 --> 01:23:49,720
It's all right, it's all right.

1111
01:23:49,763 --> 01:23:50,808
[Mary panting]

1112
01:23:50,851 --> 01:23:51,872
It's okay, it's okay, you're
okay.

1113
01:23:51,896 --> 01:23:53,071
You're okay, okay, okay.

1114
01:23:53,854 --> 01:23:54,854
What happened, babe?

1115
01:23:55,813 --> 01:23:56,857
What was it, sweetheart?

1116
01:23:56,901 --> 01:23:58,642
I don't know, fuck.

1117
01:24:02,559 --> 01:24:04,691
It's all right, it's
all right, it's all right.

1118
01:24:05,388 --> 01:24:06,388
It's okay.

1119
01:24:07,042 --> 01:24:09,522
[tense music]

1120
01:24:14,092 --> 01:24:16,616
[Psychiatrist] Mary, I'd
like to ask you something.

1121
01:24:18,444 --> 01:24:20,098
What is it you need?

1122
01:24:24,102 --> 01:24:25,102
Um,

1123
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:27,496
I uh.

1124
01:24:28,324 --> 01:24:29,586
Okay, let me put it this way.

1125
01:24:30,935 --> 01:24:34,156
What purpose would a child
serve you?

1126
01:24:35,853 --> 01:24:36,941
[Mary exhales]

1127
01:24:45,645 --> 01:24:47,386
Ma'am, there is um,

1128
01:24:51,651 --> 01:24:55,090
there's a hollow inside me.

1129
01:25:00,399 --> 01:25:02,358
I uh, I can't ever fill it.

1130
01:25:03,010 --> 01:25:05,056
Not, not even with a child.

1131
01:25:06,188 --> 01:25:10,931
It um, it burrows, deep
inside me.

1132
01:25:12,933 --> 01:25:13,933
But uh,

1133
01:25:18,025 --> 01:25:19,462
there's something else.

1134
01:25:21,464 --> 01:25:25,642
There's something beautiful
and loving,

1135
01:25:27,818 --> 01:25:31,256
and it is there for a reason.

1136
01:25:34,129 --> 01:25:35,129
It is,

1137
01:25:36,043 --> 01:25:38,916
it's there so I can give
it to somebody else.

1138
01:25:41,223 --> 01:25:42,746
I need to give it.

1139
01:25:45,749 --> 01:25:47,098
If I don't then,

1140
01:25:49,144 --> 01:25:51,058
then only the hollow exists.

1141
01:25:55,193 --> 01:25:56,193
I um,

1142
01:26:01,591 --> 01:26:04,681
I want a child because
I need to give love.

1143
01:26:06,726 --> 01:26:09,816
[Mary cries lightly]

1144
01:26:20,175 --> 01:26:22,655
[tense music]

1145
01:26:28,792 --> 01:26:30,402
What the fuck?

1146
01:26:46,244 --> 01:26:48,899
No, no no no no no no.

1147
01:27:09,528 --> 01:27:11,704
[door opening]

1148
01:27:13,097 --> 01:27:13,793
Ross?

1149
01:27:13,837 --> 01:27:14,837
[Ross] Yeah?

1150
01:27:16,318 --> 01:27:17,275
- [Man] See you.
- [Ross] Okay.

1151
01:27:17,319 --> 01:27:18,972
[Man] Yeah, good to see you.

1152
01:27:20,539 --> 01:27:21,410
You get my calls?

1153
01:27:21,453 --> 01:27:22,672
He just showed up.

1154
01:27:24,151 --> 01:27:26,031
I mean, we gotta talk
about this but I gotta go.

1155
01:27:26,328 --> 01:27:27,957
All right, I'll catch you
later, all right, Eli?

1156
01:27:27,981 --> 01:27:29,156
[Eli] All right, take care.

1157
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:30,200
Yeah.

1158
01:27:47,262 --> 01:27:49,002
You have no right showing
up like this.

1159
01:27:49,873 --> 01:27:52,049
Well now, he didn't
seem to feel the same way.

1160
01:27:52,397 --> 01:27:53,940
I told you I didn't
want to talk about it.

1161
01:27:53,964 --> 01:27:55,158
Good, all you gotta do is
listen.

1162
01:27:55,182 --> 01:27:56,182
Eli.

1163
01:27:57,489 --> 01:27:59,569
Hear me out, and I won't
bother you about it no more.

1164
01:28:08,021 --> 01:28:10,154
You look rode hard and put
away wet.

1165
01:28:13,331 --> 01:28:15,072
Yet you get prettier every day.

1166
01:28:19,381 --> 01:28:22,601
God, Mary, it don't matter
where I lay my head.

1167
01:28:23,907 --> 01:28:26,301
I left a heap of trouble back
in Texas.

1168
01:28:27,127 --> 01:28:28,607
Skipped my parole.

1169
01:28:31,393 --> 01:28:33,313
It's a matter of time
before it catches up to me.

1170
01:28:36,833 --> 01:28:37,529
This letter.

1171
01:28:37,573 --> 01:28:38,835
I know what it says.

1172
01:28:40,532 --> 01:28:42,380
Okay, well then, then you
know what they're offering.

1173
01:28:42,404 --> 01:28:43,579
That kind of money,

1174
01:28:45,189 --> 01:28:47,713
well that could, that could
really get me outta things.

1175
01:28:47,757 --> 01:28:49,236
That could get me a new start.

1176
01:28:49,846 --> 01:28:52,805
Look, this oil company, right,

1177
01:28:52,849 --> 01:28:55,808
that just, outta nowhere
they wanna buy the farm.

1178
01:28:56,635 --> 01:28:58,333
This, this is a lottery ticket.

1179
01:28:59,159 --> 01:29:01,988
We just, we need all of
us to sign off on it to sell.

1180
01:29:03,425 --> 01:29:05,862
Anything come from there is
no good.

1181
01:29:07,429 --> 01:29:08,429
We all had it bad.

1182
01:29:09,648 --> 01:29:11,368
[Mary] Yeah, some of
us worse than others.

1183
01:29:14,610 --> 01:29:16,089
All you gotta do is sign.

1184
01:29:16,916 --> 01:29:18,807
That's it, it don't have
to go no further than that.

1185
01:29:18,831 --> 01:29:20,355
I'll take care of the rest.

1186
01:29:25,795 --> 01:29:27,057
Hey, you remember that game

1187
01:29:27,100 --> 01:29:29,102
we used to play when we were
kids?

1188
01:29:29,407 --> 01:29:31,017
How I'd ask Mary, may I?

1189
01:29:32,715 --> 01:29:34,369
You'd have to do it no matter
what?

1190
01:29:35,457 --> 01:29:37,372
[ominous music]

1191
01:29:37,415 --> 01:29:38,808
I'm asking again.

1192
01:29:42,942 --> 01:29:44,422
I need this, Mary.

1193
01:29:49,296 --> 01:29:50,296
I need it.

1194
01:29:53,083 --> 01:29:54,083
I want to go back.

1195
01:29:56,608 --> 01:29:57,608
I'll go.

1196
01:29:58,480 --> 01:29:59,500
No, you don't, I'm not
asking you to do that.

1197
01:29:59,524 --> 01:30:01,308
No, I want to see it through.

1198
01:30:02,092 --> 01:30:03,615
I want to know it's gone for
good.

1199
01:30:05,617 --> 01:30:07,402
You get Tommy to sign yet?

1200
01:30:08,315 --> 01:30:10,796
Hell Tom, Tommy won't talk
to me.

1201
01:30:11,406 --> 01:30:13,277
You know that, I, it's been a
long time.

1202
01:30:13,712 --> 01:30:14,712
Do you blame him?

1203
01:30:16,062 --> 01:30:17,062
Not at all.

1204
01:30:18,282 --> 01:30:20,242
If he'd give me the time
of day I'd tell him that.

1205
01:30:21,198 --> 01:30:23,505
But you, you're in contact
with him, now and again, right?

1206
01:30:27,987 --> 01:30:28,987
God.

1207
01:30:30,425 --> 01:30:32,470
What would anyone want with
that farm?

1208
01:30:36,082 --> 01:30:38,084
If you go, you need to
convince Tommy

1209
01:30:38,128 --> 01:30:39,651
it's time to let the place go.

1210
01:30:41,436 --> 01:30:44,569
Eli, what about Pa?

1211
01:30:47,224 --> 01:30:49,574
Don't worry, I'll deal with
our father.

You okay?

1215

You just gonna stay in there

Look at you.

1220
01:33:12,674 --> 01:33:13,674
Oh, God.

1221
01:33:14,980 --> 01:33:15,981
Oh, God.

1222
01:33:18,331 --> 01:33:20,464
You're so much bigger than I
remember.

1223
01:33:21,552 --> 01:33:23,293
Yeah, I've always been big,
Mary.

1224
01:33:24,686 --> 01:33:26,470
I just ain't seen you in so
long.

1225
01:33:28,211 --> 01:33:29,299

Oh, I've been, I wear the.

Come on in.

1242
01:34:42,764 --> 01:34:44,722
I figured you two would be
here earlier.

1243
01:34:45,984 --> 01:34:47,290
How'd you figure that?

1244
01:34:48,508 --> 01:34:50,075
How'd you know we were coming?

1245
01:34:55,298 --> 01:34:57,300
I got a letter from the oil
company.

1246

Y'all staying the night?

1247

[Josiah] So they are.

1260
01:35:56,881 --> 01:35:59,754
Eli look like he been
through a hard spell.

1261
01:36:02,104 --> 01:36:03,932
Mary looks as pretty as ever.

1262
01:36:05,672 --> 01:36:08,850
- [Josiah] Pretty as ever.
- [laughs]

1263
01:36:10,286 --> 01:36:11,461
Steady, boy.

1264
01:36:19,643 --> 01:36:20,992
[bell ringing]

1265
01:36:21,253 --> 01:36:24,169
Ah, thank you, Jesus.

1266
01:36:28,173 --> 01:36:29,566
That's a familiar sight.

1267
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:39,881
[tense music]

1268
01:36:53,155 --> 01:36:54,634
Best get to it, then.

1269
01:36:55,113 --> 01:36:58,464
[tense music continues]

1270
01:37:09,736 --> 01:37:11,129
We should leave it all.

1271
01:37:14,306 --> 01:37:15,699
They start digging,

1272
01:37:15,742 --> 01:37:17,155
they might hit something
we can't have them finding.

1273
01:37:17,179 --> 01:37:18,179
Eli...

1274
01:37:22,619 --> 01:37:24,708
That sink hole is
still down by the creek.

1275
01:37:25,970 --> 01:37:27,102
It's a salvage dump.

1276
01:37:27,145 --> 01:37:28,886
They're gonna fill it soon
enough and,

1277
01:37:31,149 --> 01:37:33,108
ain't nobody gonna look at
what's in it.

1278
01:37:37,590 --> 01:37:38,678
20 minutes.

1279
01:37:40,463 --> 01:37:43,640
Eli, I sat in the car for 20
minutes before I could go in.

1280
01:37:47,078 --> 01:37:50,647
- You went in, right?
- [ominous music]

1281
01:37:50,690 --> 01:37:51,735
That's all that matters.

1282
01:37:52,040 --> 01:37:55,565
[ominous music continues]

1283
01:38:07,664 --> 01:38:09,579
God, what are we doing here?

1284
01:38:20,851 --> 01:38:22,070
You see, son?

1285
01:38:23,114 --> 01:38:24,289
God don't lie.

1286
01:38:25,334 --> 01:38:26,596
Your mother, she saw it.

1287
01:38:26,639 --> 01:38:28,685
Saw what they were all these
years.

1288
01:38:29,599 --> 01:38:30,774
Drove her mad.

1289
01:38:31,166 --> 01:38:33,472
Couldn't turn it off.
[baby whimpering]

1290
01:38:33,777 --> 01:38:35,387
They the reason she burn.

1291
01:38:36,345 --> 01:38:38,869
[tense music]

1292
01:39:37,145 --> 01:39:39,669
[tense music]

1293
01:39:50,245 --> 01:39:51,768
Been fixing the place up.

1294
01:39:53,857 --> 01:39:56,120
Yeah, you already said that.

1295
01:39:56,468 --> 01:39:58,035
- Yeah?
- Mm-hm.

1296
01:39:59,254 --> 01:40:00,995
I ain't gotten to all that
mail yet.

1297
01:40:01,604 --> 01:40:02,604
It just.

1298
01:40:03,258 --> 01:40:04,781
Come sit with me, Tommy.

1299
01:40:05,912 --> 01:40:08,654
[tense music]

1300
01:40:08,698 --> 01:40:09,698
Okay.

1301
01:40:09,873 --> 01:40:11,527
Yeah, okay.

1302
01:40:14,182 --> 01:40:16,880
[ominous music]

1303
01:40:43,776 --> 01:40:44,777
How you doin'?

1304
01:40:46,127 --> 01:40:47,127
Really?

1305
01:40:49,130 --> 01:40:52,176
Oh, you know, getting along.

1306
01:40:53,917 --> 01:40:54,917
You uh,

1307
01:40:56,963 --> 01:40:58,791
you seem glad to see Eli.

1308
01:41:03,361 --> 01:41:04,971
I'm glad to see you both.

1309
01:41:07,235 --> 01:41:09,063
Well, he was afraid you
wouldn't be.

1310
01:41:10,325 --> 01:41:12,327
He says he's been trying

1311
01:41:12,370 --> 01:41:14,285
to get a hold of you for a
while now.

1312
01:41:15,982 --> 01:41:17,462
- Oh yeah?
- Mm-hm.

1313
01:41:19,595 --> 01:41:21,031
I saw that. [Laughs]

1314
01:41:21,814 --> 01:41:22,814
Yeah.

1315
01:41:27,298 --> 01:41:28,560
That's a lady bug.

1316
01:41:31,172 --> 01:41:33,217
Well I say the past is the
past, you know?

1317
01:41:35,741 --> 01:41:37,613
All that matters is we here now.

1318
01:41:44,185 --> 01:41:45,577
The letter, Tommy.

1319
01:41:47,013 --> 01:41:49,015
There's some men from an oil
company.

1320
01:41:50,713 --> 01:41:51,864
I guess they want to buy the
farm.

1321
01:41:51,888 --> 01:41:54,543
[phone vibrating]

1322
01:41:57,850 --> 01:41:59,243
Will you give me a second?

1323
01:42:00,201 --> 01:42:01,202
Be my guest.

1324
01:42:01,767 --> 01:42:02,942
Take your time.

1325
01:42:06,946 --> 01:42:09,601
[ominous music]

1326
01:42:10,124 --> 01:42:15,607
[thud pounding, dragging]

1327
01:42:15,651 --> 01:42:17,087
Is everything okay?

1328
01:42:19,220 --> 01:42:20,220
Ross?

1329
01:42:21,309 --> 01:42:22,909
[Ross] Hey, how soon can
you come home?

1330
01:42:25,051 --> 01:42:26,357
Why, what is it?

1331
01:42:26,705 --> 01:42:28,664
[Ross] They made a
decision, baby.

1332
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:32,058
Mary, you're gonna be a mother.

1333
01:42:33,973 --> 01:42:35,584
[Mary crying]

1334
01:42:35,627 --> 01:42:36,627
Mary?

1335
01:42:37,934 --> 01:42:39,370
Oh my God.

1336
01:42:39,892 --> 01:42:44,027
Ah, I can't believe it.
Ah...

1337
01:42:47,422 --> 01:42:48,901
Hey Mary, you still there?

1338
01:42:51,469 --> 01:42:52,469
Mary?

1339
01:43:02,567 --> 01:43:04,395
Best get to it, then.

1340
01:43:06,223 --> 01:43:08,138
[Eli panting]

1341
01:43:08,182 --> 01:43:10,662
[tense music]

1342
01:43:46,176 --> 01:43:48,222
[Eli] Well, I guess we're
gonna have ourselves

1343
01:43:48,265 --> 01:43:49,788
a little sit down, huh?

1344
01:43:50,876 --> 01:43:52,226
You guessed right.

1345
01:43:52,617 --> 01:43:55,272
[intense music]

1346
01:44:06,892 --> 01:44:08,807
Is there something you
wanna tell us?

1347
01:44:09,286 --> 01:44:10,592
Tell it, boy.

1348
01:44:12,420 --> 01:44:14,291
Tell him what your mama say.

1349
01:44:14,335 --> 01:44:15,335
Ma,

1350
01:44:19,557 --> 01:44:21,385
she's in the hellfire.

1351
01:44:22,081 --> 01:44:23,082
Hellfire?

1352
01:44:23,648 --> 01:44:26,390
You figure ma's in hell, is
that it?

1353
01:44:26,434 --> 01:44:30,525
I figure we all gonna be,
unless we change our way.

1354
01:44:31,177 --> 01:44:34,224
You need to live pure,
righteous.

1355
01:44:34,268 --> 01:44:36,748
I doubt I'm ever gonna be
saved, Tommy.

1356
01:44:37,401 --> 01:44:39,360
Sure as shit ain't gonna be
pure.

1357
01:44:40,361 --> 01:44:42,406
What the fuck do you
about being righteous, huh?

1358
01:44:42,711 --> 01:44:45,017
This here's a restraining order.

1359
01:44:45,670 --> 01:44:47,281
Your ex-wife's attorney.

1360
01:44:49,326 --> 01:44:50,326
That,

1361
01:44:51,720 --> 01:44:52,895
that ain't real.

1362
01:44:52,938 --> 01:44:53,983
[Eli] Oh that ain't real?

1363
01:44:54,549 --> 01:44:55,898
What about out back?

1364
01:44:56,855 --> 01:44:58,093
Yeah, you know what I'm
talkin' about.

1365
01:44:58,117 --> 01:44:59,117
Is that real?

1366
01:44:59,815 --> 01:45:01,730
Your ex-wife, Tommy.

1367
01:45:03,427 --> 01:45:04,733
Her name's Catherine.

1368
01:45:06,343 --> 01:45:07,562
She left you a year ago.

1369
01:45:07,605 --> 01:45:09,781
She remarried a man named Tate.

1370
01:45:11,174 --> 01:45:13,437
He's your boy's stepfather.

1371
01:45:13,481 --> 01:45:14,873
He's my best friend.

1372
01:45:14,917 --> 01:45:15,918
[Mary] He's your son.

1373
01:45:15,961 --> 01:45:17,485
[Thomas] That's who he is.

1374
01:45:17,528 --> 01:45:18,486
[Eli] All these letters.

1375
01:45:18,529 --> 01:45:19,922
All these letter right here,

1376
01:45:19,965 --> 01:45:21,639
they're telling you to keep
away from them.

1377
01:45:21,663 --> 01:45:23,142
Says you hadn't been doing it.

1378
01:45:23,578 --> 01:45:26,276
Is that why you moved
back here? To the farm?

1379
01:45:29,018 --> 01:45:31,281
How long you been here, hm?

1380
01:45:33,109 --> 01:45:34,458
What the hell's goin' on with
you?

1381
01:45:37,331 --> 01:45:38,549
The two of you.

1382
01:45:41,030 --> 01:45:42,336
Ma, she saw it.

1383
01:45:44,468 --> 01:45:46,296
She killed herself 'cause of it.

1384
01:45:50,431 --> 01:45:52,476
You know you two had that baby.

1385
01:45:57,002 --> 01:45:58,002
Oh shit.

1386
01:46:01,093 --> 01:46:03,400
Tommy, you, you don't
you know, do you?

1387
01:46:04,227 --> 01:46:05,533
What do you mean?

1388
01:46:07,535 --> 01:46:08,797
That baby came from Pa.

1389
01:46:08,840 --> 01:46:10,538
- Liars!
- [fist slamming table]

1390
01:46:10,886 --> 01:46:15,717
Liars! Drowning in their
unholy semen of their incest!

1391
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:16,761
Stop no.

1392
01:46:18,023 --> 01:46:18,981
Okay.

1393
01:46:19,024 --> 01:46:20,199
[Mary] Oh my God.

1394
01:46:20,243 --> 01:46:22,201
[Thomas] Okay, that ain't true.

1395
01:46:23,289 --> 01:46:25,204
Who the fuck you talking
to, Tommy?

1396
01:46:25,770 --> 01:46:27,729
- [Eli] Huh?
- Boy, you know the truth.

1397
01:46:27,772 --> 01:46:29,295
You tell him what I saw.

1398
01:46:32,211 --> 01:46:33,387
- Pa.
- [Mary gasps]

1399
01:46:33,691 --> 01:46:34,736
Oh my God.

1400
01:46:34,779 --> 01:46:35,606
Oh my God.

1401
01:46:35,650 --> 01:46:36,999
Oh the lord!

1402
01:46:42,570 --> 01:46:44,006
You sin together.

1403
01:46:45,486 --> 01:46:47,401
You still sin together.

1404
01:46:50,621 --> 01:46:54,320
You were at that motel
before you come home.

1405
01:46:54,364 --> 01:46:56,105
[Eli] What, are you
watching us, Tommy?

1406
01:46:56,148 --> 01:46:57,933
And you sinned again.

1407
01:46:57,976 --> 01:46:58,997
I'm shacking up at that motel

1408
01:46:59,021 --> 01:47:01,197
'cause I got nothing to go
back to.

1409
01:47:01,240 --> 01:47:02,392
And Mary, she came and met me.

1410
01:47:02,416 --> 01:47:03,896
She followed me up the rest
of the way

1411
01:47:03,939 --> 01:47:05,331
so we could do this together.

1412
01:47:05,375 --> 01:47:06,550
[Mary] How dare you.

1413
01:47:06,594 --> 01:47:08,030
[Thomas] Just admit it.

1414
01:47:08,073 --> 01:47:09,597
He'll forgive you.

1415
01:47:09,858 --> 01:47:11,903
Pa'll forgave you, I forgive
you.

1416
01:47:13,688 --> 01:47:14,645
Ma would forgive you.

1417
01:47:14,689 --> 01:47:16,647
Tommy listen, okay.

1418
01:47:16,691 --> 01:47:19,520
Pa has been dead and
buried for 23 years now.

1419
01:47:19,563 --> 01:47:21,043
You're not listening.

1420
01:47:21,086 --> 01:47:23,001
[Eli] Tommy, that grave's
been dug up.

1421
01:47:23,959 --> 01:47:25,526
He's trying to save us.

1422
01:47:25,569 --> 01:47:26,569
Save us?

1423
01:47:27,658 --> 01:47:29,355
You know how you got your ear
like that?

1424
01:47:30,922 --> 01:47:32,663
Pa found you playing with his
pipe

1425
01:47:33,490 --> 01:47:34,815
and wanted to teach you what
happens

1426
01:47:34,839 --> 01:47:36,754
when you play with his things.

1427
01:47:37,146 --> 01:47:38,364
So he heated up an iron

1428
01:47:38,408 --> 01:47:40,323
and he stuck it on the side
of your head.

1429
01:47:41,977 --> 01:47:44,283
You were four years
old when that happened.

1430
01:47:46,111 --> 01:47:47,939
Me, he liked to use a strap.

1431
01:47:49,375 --> 01:47:51,639
Said it wasn't a lesson
unless it bled.

1432
01:47:53,336 --> 01:47:55,207
He taught me lots of lessons.

1433
01:47:56,382 --> 01:47:57,382
And Mary,

1434
01:47:58,776 --> 01:48:02,301
well, well that was
something different, wasn't it?

1435
01:48:06,871 --> 01:48:09,526
[intense music]

1436
01:48:11,354 --> 01:48:12,921
The old man had nothing
