1
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:42,664
Bets around, bets around.
Let's go, Jameson.

2
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:47,662
Everybody in? Atkins, Atkins?

3
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:51,237
Oh, come on, man, let's go.

4
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:55,410
No, man, your sister
didn't send me that check yet.

5
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:14,264
No, this is how you play the...
This is how you play Texas Hold'em.

6
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,594
You just told us how to play it!

7
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:20,634
This is how you play Texas Hold'em.

8
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:26,569
Will you flip another card.
This is the fourth fucking...

9
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:32,049
- Four of a kind.
- What do you got, Melvin?

10
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:35,516
Yo, Melvin, man,
what you gonna do,

11
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:37,986
you gonna play the cards
or you gonna hatch them?

12
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:42,287
I ain't gonna hatch them. I need to
run out to the ATM real quick.

13
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:45,789
There's gotta be a...

14
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,024
Gotta be a 7-Eleven
out there somewhere.

15
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:53,363
Let me get two.

16
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:31,737
So why don't we just go directly in.

17
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:34,271
Right up this route, straight in.

18
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:38,173
Yes, well, I see the captain
enjoys the road less traveled.

19
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,511
No, the captain enjoys
not going down the highway,

20
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,850
dragging his ass so every Tom, Dick
and Qaddafi can take a whack at it.

21
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,090
It's very bad here.

22
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:50,691
It's bad here, it's still bad here.

23
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,922
And I've heard it's bad
right down here.

24
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:55,300
- Bad everywhere, huh?
- Yeah.

25
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:56,559
Mines?

26
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,899
Tricky. Swedish-made.

27
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:08,804
The man didn't say anything
about mines to me.

28
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:11,516
Sergeant Shaw.

29
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:19,024
- Sergeant.
- Sir.

30
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:21,489
Rolling in two minutes.

31
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:23,093
Yes, sir.

32
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,329
You okay?

33
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:27,726
Yes, sir.

34
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:31,627
Two minutes.

35
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:34,963
Yo, give me two cards, man.

36
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:57,919
Captain says we're moving out.

37
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,189
So...

38
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:08,863
Hey, that cat needs a friend.
And a hug.

39
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:12,640
It was just before Desert Storm.

40
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:16,246
We were on a routine recon
inside Iraqi-controlled terrain,

41
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:18,246
assessing enemy troop strength

42
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:22,785
for what Saddam Hussein promised
would be the mother of all wars.

43
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,648
I'm in the lead vehicle
with Sergeant Shaw

44
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:30,056
and our guide, a civilian contractor.

45
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:33,061
The night is clear.
Stars, but no moon.

46
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:36,991
Ambush!

47
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:42,374
Hang on.

48
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:52,241
Exit the vehicle.
On me! On me!

49
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:54,017
Get a flare up, sergeant.

50
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:06,596
Enemy dismount! Go after, go after!
Stay left!

51
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:08,266
Covering, covering, covering!

52
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:09,935
Bear right!

53
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:11,967
Move it, move it, move it!

54
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:31,846
Captain Marco!

55
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,524
Sir?

56
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:38,054
Was you scared?

57
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,764
Scared? Well...

58
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,394
...there was really no time
to be scared.

59
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:49,964
With complete disregard
for his own life,

60
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:53,805
Sergeant Raymond Shaw
engaged single-handedly

61
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,280
an entire company of the enemy.

62
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,421
Sergeant Shaw was awarded
the Medal of Honor.

63
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:06,114
I signed the recommendation myself.

64
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,121
Yes, sir.

65
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:11,228
Were you wounded?

66
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,625
I was, I was injured.

67
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,464
Concussion, lost focus.
Sergeant Shaw, he took command.

68
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:18,102
Major?

69
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:21,997
- Yes.
- Did your unit sustain any casualties?

70
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:26,508
Yes. PFC Edward Ingram,

71
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:30,910
PFC Robert Baker III
were killed.

72
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:33,978
Now, the Medal of Honor,
Congressional Medal of Honor,

73
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:37,814
is the highest award that any soldier
could aspire to.

74
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:40,754
What these brave men
that I've talked about today did

75
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,451
should never be forgotten.

76
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:49,033
Since 1917, there have only been
970 Medals awarded,

77
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:53,296
out of a total of 30 million
Americans at arms.

78
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:55,368
Who knows.

79
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:58,169
Maybe one day,
one of you fine young men

80
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:02,409
will earn that medal
in defense of this great nation.

81
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,642
Yes.

82
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:09,549
Major Marco,
on behalf of Troops 1094 and 1128,

83
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:11,416
just wanna thank you

84
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:13,489
for coming to speak to us
about the Medal of Honor

85
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:17,527
and about your interesting experiences
in the armed forces.

86
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,527
Thanks for listening.

87
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:26,594
Thank you very much.

88
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,531
You ever wish it had been you?

89
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:32,109
I'm sorry, excuse me?

90
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,213
Won the Medal.

91
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:37,874
Been... Been the hero.

92
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:42,681
Well, sir, I'm just...
I'm just proud that I was there.

93
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:44,379
Thank you.

94
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:47,087
Thank you very much.

95
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:11,914
- Major Marco?
- Yes.

96
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:15,716
Al Melvin, sir.

97
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,486
Corporal Melvin.

98
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:23,924
From your unit, Desert Storm.

99
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:28,025
Corporal Melvin. How you doing?

100
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,902
I have these dreams, sir.

101
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,704
- Dreams?
- Yes, sir.

102
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:40,442
Kuwait. It's you and me,

103
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:43,843
Ingram and Baker and...

104
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:46,974
...Raymond Shaw.

105
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:49,916
Okay.

106
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:54,050
See, I remember it happened
like you just said,

107
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,727
and then...

108
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:58,254
...I don't.

109
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,528
Well...

110
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:03,599
...we had it pretty rough
over there, Melvin.

111
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:05,964
That was a long time ago.
Memories shift.

112
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:12,503
Do you have dreams, sir?

113
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:14,176
Everybody has dreams, corporal.

114
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,109
No, not these.

115
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:18,249
No, I don't.

116
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,712
I write it all down.
You know, like, every night,

117
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:29,418
right when I wake up,
I try to get it down.

118
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,460
It doesn't always come together,
you know,

119
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:32,995
not everything that I can remember.

120
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,331
Maybe you should go
to the V.A. Hospital,

121
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:38,662
talk to one of the doctors.

122
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:41,032
- I've been to doctors, man.
- Okay.

123
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:47,877
I'm just... I'm just...

124
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,277
I'm just a little stuck, sir.

125
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:55,818
Because I remember, okay, Shaw...

126
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:59,150
Shaw, okay...
Shaw saving us, right...

127
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:01,987
...but that doesn't make sense,
because...

128
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,294
...that should've been you.

129
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,627
Okay, if Shaw is in the Hummer...

130
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:12,128
...the Toyota is here...

131
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,068
All right. Just get up, get up.

132
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:16,764
Listen, it's...

133
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:20,969
That's over with. That's done.
Okay? You gotta move on.

134
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,080
What I was hoping is that,
you know, maybe...

135
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:24,442
You need some money
or something?

136
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:25,810
- No, no, sir.
- Wait a minute.

137
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,009
I don't need your money, man.

138
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:30,849
All right. It was great to see you.

139
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:56,379
Paper or plastic, sir?

140
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:02,649
With public anxiety being rekindled
by the events of Bloody Friday,

141
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:08,191
with the war on terror continuing into
yet another year, no end in sight,

142
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,158
the worries just continue to grow.

143
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:13,797
Polls indicate that
more and more voters

144
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:17,230
are concerned with
personal family safety,

145
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:19,461
with economic security,

146
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:22,732
fearing more and more jobs
going overseas

147
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:26,571
or being taken by
illegal immigrants.

148
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:30,840
They're concerned with the quality
of air and our water,

149
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:34,542
the degradation caused by the
rollback in environmental regulations,

150
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:38,053
by religious and racial polarization,

151
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:42,853
with the drumbeat of body bags
coming from all over the globe.

152
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:46,395
The American people are ready
for a new agenda.

153
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:51,434
But because this party is so
divided on so many issues,

154
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:55,664
the choice of a vice presidential
nominee may very well be

155
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:59,834
the unifying factor for delegates
at this convention.

156
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:02,840
And if this respect propels me
toward the nomination

157
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:07,485
as your vice presidential candidate,
I will be greatly honored.

158
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:12,553
We need to look inward,
attend to our own house.

159
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,986
The danger to our country is not only
from some terrorists at large,

160
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:20,029
terrorists who, by the way,
we've helped engender

161
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:23,199
with 20 years
of failed foreign policy.

162
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:28,203
No, the real danger
is from suspending civil liberties,

163
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,109
gutting the Bill of Rights,
allowing our fear

164
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,608
to destroy our democratic ideals,

165
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:37,749
because once we start overturning
our constitutional protections,

166
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,474
our enemies have won.

167
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:44,515
Raymond?

168
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:46,623
- There he is.
- Darling.

169
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:50,489
What, were you gonna make me
stand out there like room service?

170
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,837
I asked downstairs and Miss Freeman,
your wrangler, helpful Miss Freeman,

171
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:02,940
she said you were up here
practicing your speech.

172
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:05,235
I don't honestly understand why

173
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:08,208
you insist upon
isolating yourself, Raymond.

174
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:10,541
People adore you,
they crave your company,

175
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:12,182
and yet here you are,

176
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:14,716
holed up as if you were some sort of

177
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,583
emotionally challenged individual
like your father.

178
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:23,524
Shut up, Tom.
Instead of Raymond Prentiss Shaw,

179
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:26,394
handsome, intelligent,

180
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:29,625
people-loving war hero
with a great deal to offer his party.

181
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:32,065
- No.
- And his country.

182
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:33,363
No.

183
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:35,301
- No, what?
- No.

184
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:37,031
I haven't even asked you
a question yet.

185
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:39,006
No to the question
you're going to ask.

186
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,270
No to all of the questions
you pretend to want to ask.

187
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,606
Your hair is too flat.

188
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:44,715
And no, you may not engage
in your usual backdoor

189
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:45,884
And that tie...

190
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:48,610
political thuggery to shovel me
onto the presidential ticket.

191
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:52,048
Tie's wrong. Something less busy.

192
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:55,853
Oh, you're not interested.

193
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:59,030
Of course I'm interested.
I wouldn't be here if I wasn't.

194
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,563
But not if it means attacking
the reputation

195
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:03,428
of a statesman like Tom Jordan,

196
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:06,104
which I am sure
was part of your plan.

197
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:12,073
Excuse me, when have I ever
attacked Senator Jordan, despite...

198
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:14,003
Despite what?

199
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:17,105
Despite the shameful way
his daughter toyed with you

200
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:19,546
that summer at the shore.

201
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:23,953
You chased her away, Mother,
let's not have any illusions about...

202
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:26,556
She wasn't in your league, but if that's
the way you choose to remember it...

203
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,954
You destroyed any possibility
of us ever...

204
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:32,619
Honey, you are oversimplifying things
a little bit, but it's okay.

205
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,059
I'll stay out of it.

206
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:37,597
You have my word.

207
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:43,230
Thank you. Thank you.

208
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:48,675
I think you all know my mother,
Senator Eleanor Prentiss Shaw.

209
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:54,309
And some of you, no doubt,
remember my father,

210
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,512
the late Senator John Shaw.

211
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:04,053
I've been honored to serve
my two terms in Congress.

212
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:06,390
But I also grew up on the Hill.

213
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:09,795
I've seen how the game is played
by professionals,

214
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:11,765
how deals are struck,

215
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:15,270
committees bullied,
agendas bought and sold.

216
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:19,376
And with apologies to my mother,
I wish to remain an amateur.

217
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:25,383
I believe democracy
is not negotiable.

218
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:32,647
I believe that freedom from fear
in the world at large and here at home

219
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:35,190
is not negotiable.

220
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:42,266
I know how much Americans
have to fear today.

221
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:44,993
But I can tell you
that I've been there.

222
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:49,001
I've faced the enemy firsthand
on the battlefront.

223
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,409
I know what it is to be afraid.

224
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:56,645
But I am living proof
that we can win.

225
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:59,851
We can prevail.

226
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:07,349
We must secure tomorrow today.
Thank you.

227
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,031
- Bluffing?
- That was the inference.

228
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:18,362
They should be down on their fat,
white knees, thanking me

229
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,868
for saving this party from
committing political seppuku.

230
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:23,405
You gave them every opportunity
to do the right thing, senator.

231
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:27,010
No. I gave them one opportunity and
that was unusually generous of me.

232
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:28,937
See if you can get a hold of
Bob Arthur,

233
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:30,809
because I'm gonna wanna
meet with him.

234
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:32,574
Thank you very much
for arranging this.

235
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:34,548
- I appreciate it.
- Sure.

236
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,383
- Mr. Secretary.
- Senator.

237
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,649
Thank you very much
for taking this meeting.

238
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:44,192
- Good to see you again.
- Leona. So nice to see you, Leona.

239
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,956
Buddy. Gentlemen.

240
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:50,228
No, I thought we settled it
this morning.

241
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:52,301
All right, I'll keep you posted.

242
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:58,476
The decision is final.

243
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:00,804
Thank you very much.

244
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,409
- How's Jeanine?
- Senator.

245
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:07,985
Tom Jordan's on the ticket.

246
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:10,655
Now, we don't need your blessing,

247
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:11,914
but we'd like it.

248
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:17,120
Okay, so before we get started,
I'm just...

249
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,791
I'm dying to know...

250
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:26,465
...which genius hatched the idea of
pairing a sound bite from Nebraska

251
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:30,108
with a relic who thinks that keeping
suicide bombers off our buses

252
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:33,369
is unconstitutional.
Was it you, Gordy?

253
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:37,038
All the research indicates
that an Arthur-Jordan ticket

254
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:38,739
sits quite well
with the American people.

255
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,476
"Sits quite well"
translates into how many votes?

256
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:43,951
Your son is largely unknown
outside of New York.

257
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:47,681
I mean, his public service,
his congressional record,

258
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:49,588
while commendable,
is not the kind of thing...

259
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:50,762
My son is a war hero.

260
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,830
Governor Arthur has agreed
to consider Raymond

261
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:55,829
for a cabinet-level post.

262
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:57,524
We didn't come here
to have a discussion.

263
00:18:57,736 --> 00:18:59,101
Did we come here
to have a discussion?

264
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:02,296
Ellie, you don't have the votes
to block this.

265
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:04,942
Not even to push the nomination
to a second ballot.

266
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,510
Oh, Jim, even running against
this cut-and-fold vice president,

267
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:11,672
with his party's record of
abysmal failure at home and abroad,

268
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:15,684
Governor Arthur is still unelectable
to the presidency...

269
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:17,219
...without help.

270
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:20,687
Consider, that our intrepid Arthur

271
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:23,684
can hold on to his own home ground,
and the Northeast,

272
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:26,956
and even California,
we are still dead across the South.

273
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,963
He's not dead completely
in the South, senator...

274
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,796
And the Southwest,
where they win by landslides.

275
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,130
I mean, you know this.

276
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,738
Your focus groups,
your polls all tell you this.

277
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:37,340
They back me up, right?

278
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:40,103
Now, you're counting on
Tom Jordan to help you get

279
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:42,212
the black vote, women
and college kids.

280
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:44,644
My gut instinct says he won't,

281
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:50,152
and on Arthur to somehow hold
the center, where he is soft at best.

282
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,915
We're confident
this is a winning ticket, Ellie.

283
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,616
What's your margin of error, Vaughn?

284
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:57,522
Five points?

285
00:19:57,729 --> 00:19:59,287
Three?

286
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:01,591
I can swing that, and you know it.

287
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,268
Oh, I could swing seven
away from you.

288
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:06,061
That's more than enough
to split the ticket.

289
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:09,138
And deny us the White House
another four years? No.

290
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:10,467
No, not even you.

291
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:13,042
Not even you, senator,
will do that, you are bluffing.

292
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:15,372
Oh, no, no, no, senator,
I would and I will

293
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:19,278
and I will do whatever is necessary
to protect America

294
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:22,146
from anyone who opposes her.

295
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:25,187
I can't...
Am I the only person in this room

296
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,119
who's been reading
these NSA reports?

297
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:29,658
- I've read them.
- All right, then you know,

298
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:32,955
you know we are on the brink
of another cataclysm,

299
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:35,190
probably nuclear, on our own soil.

300
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,628
Oh, Ellie, that's a bit extreme.

301
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:38,530
And it's not from random terrorists,

302
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:41,069
but from covert alliances
of disaffected nations

303
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:45,437
who have all been made bold
by this kind of Jordan one-worlder

304
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:48,112
who believes that human beings
are essentially good

305
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:50,144
and that our power is somehow,
I don't know,

306
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:53,011
shameful or evil or never to be used.

307
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:55,812
Make no mistake,
the American people are terrified.

308
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:58,421
They know something's coming.
They can feel it.

309
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:02,816
And we can either shovel them
the same old shit and call it sugar

310
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:05,223
or we can arm them.

311
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:08,695
We can arm them with a young,
vibrant vice president.

312
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,358
We can give them heat, energy,
give them a war hero with heart,

313
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:15,904
forged by enemy fire
in the desert in the dark,

314
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:19,271
when American lives
hung in the balance.

315
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:39,360
Give us a few minutes.

316
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:42,857
Thank you.

317
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:45,332
Mr. Secretary,
thank you for your time.

318
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:48,170
- Thank you.
- Really appreciate it.

319
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:52,536
- Leona, good evening.
- Thank you, Ellie.

320
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:55,709
Well, they're gonna have to make
their own decisions.

321
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:58,781
I am proud...

322
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:01,909
...to offer into nomination

323
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:07,956
the name of the next vice president
of these United States:

324
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,652
Raymond Shaw!

325
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:13,626
A remarkable development.
Twenty-four hours ago,

326
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,527
New York Congressman
Raymond Prentiss Shaw

327
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:17,599
wasn't even being mentioned
as a possible candidate

328
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:20,567
for the vice presidential nomination
four years from now,

329
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:22,831
much less this current convention.

330
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:26,033
Some incredible news
from the convention floor tonight.

331
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:27,973
Like a long shot
catching the favorite

332
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,045
on the back stretch
of the Kentucky Derby,

333
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:32,808
Raymond Shaw has overtaken
Senator Thomas Jordan

334
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,885
to gain the vice presidential
nomination.

335
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:40,252
Raymond Shaw bears the lineage
of the fabled Prentiss family dynasty.

336
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:45,028
Grandson of legendary industrialist
and diplomat Tyler Prentiss,

337
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:48,461
son of controversial
Senator Eleanor Prentiss Shaw,

338
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:51,033
who took over the seat
vacated by her husband,

339
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:52,498
the esteemed John Shaw,

340
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:56,401
when he died tragically
over 20 years ago.

341
00:22:57,242 --> 00:23:00,268
For many, Raymond Prentiss Shaw
is an enigma.

342
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:02,379
The millionaire
Harvard honors student

343
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:04,173
who enlisted in the infantry,

344
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:07,978
refusing the officer's commission
to which he was entitled.

345
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:09,915
Media-shy and reclusive,

346
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:12,056
Raymond Shaw's life
was forever changed

347
00:23:12,257 --> 00:23:13,918
on the killing fields of Kuwait,

348
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:18,085
where he won the Congressional
Medal of Honor for combat bravery.

349
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:21,493
Two members of Sergeant Shaw's
famed "Lost Patrol,"

350
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,134
PFC Edward Ingram

351
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:27,430
and PFC Robert Baker III,
were killed.

352
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:31,097
Their guide, a civilian contractor,
disappeared in the ambush.

353
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:35,637
But Sergeant Shaw
heroically fought off the enemy

354
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:38,042
and guided the shell-shocked
survivors of the Lost Patrol

355
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,946
across hostile terrain to safety.

356
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:45,249
Raymond Shaw is probably
the kindest, bravest, warmest...

357
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:47,357
Most selfless human being
I've ever known.

358
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:48,958
The celebrated war hero,

359
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:52,927
who dedicated himself to
public service after Desert Storm.

360
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:57,033
The Medal of Honor winner, beloved
by the men of the Lost Patrol.

361
00:23:57,402 --> 00:23:59,393
He quickly turned his energies
to public service

362
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,435
in his adopted state of New York.

363
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:04,231
- The revolutionary science
of biogenetics,

364
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:07,310
which has literally transformed...

365
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:09,571
Captain Marco!

366
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:15,985
The revolutionary science
of biogenetics.

367
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:19,180
The revolutionary science
of biogenetics,

368
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:21,757
which has literally transformed...

369
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:27,097
- Captain Marco!
- Raymond Shaw is the most selfless

370
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,732
human being I've ever known.

371
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:33,337
Raymond Shaw is probably
the kindest, bravest, warmest...

372
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:36,974
Yet note the complexity
of the frontal lobe.

373
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:39,507
Nevertheless...

374
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:41,144
Captain.

375
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,410
Help me.

376
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:47,479
Sergeant Shaw.

377
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:48,948
Captain.

378
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,587
Suffocate Private Baker. Kill him.

379
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:53,781
Raymond Shaw is probably
the kindest, bravest, warmest,

380
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:58,656
most selfless human being
I've ever known.

381
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:05,194
Raymond Shaw...

382
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:09,703
Excellent, excellent.
Go on, Raymond.

383
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:12,076
Good, good, Raymond.

384
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:16,205
Raymond Shaw is probably
the kindest, bravest,

385
00:25:16,414 --> 00:25:19,008
warmest, most selfless
human being I've ever known.

386
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:41,899
No offense, major...

387
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:45,842
...but it sort of chaps my ass
that we have to have a babysitter.

388
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,909
I'm just here to make sure
you don't get cornered

389
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:49,910
by some Air Force general's
unhappy wife.

390
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:53,181
Major Marco,
we should be so lucky.

391
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:54,851
- So nice to meet you.
- Thank you.

392
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,385
- Thank you.
- Nice to meet you.

393
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:58,886
Raymond Shaw.

394
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,819
Major Marco, this army of two

395
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:02,994
are gonna do some recon
at the no-host bar.

396
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:05,958
- A failed foreign policy which has
only served to galvanize our enemies.

397
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:08,123
Excuse me, please.

398
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,893
In fact, mobilizing an ersatz
army of malcontents...

399
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:14,560
- General Sloan, you lead the charge.
- Absolutely.

400
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:16,832
William. Hi, how are you?

401
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:19,704
All right, good.
Have you met my wife, Pam?

402
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:22,812
- Hello, how are you?
- Hello, Bob Arthur.

403
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:27,414
I mean, isn't that supposed to be
the point of this great country of ours,

404
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:29,416
that everybody matters.

405
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:32,454
Not just the people at this party.

406
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:39,420
But perhaps more importantly,
those who can't afford to be here.

407
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:42,327
- Raymond. Sorry to interrupt.
- Excuse me.

408
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:44,659
- Bob. You know my daughter.
- Tom, I can't believe it.

409
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:48,396
Of course.
Jocelyn, good to see you again.

410
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:51,535
- Mark.
- Eleanor.

411
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:55,406
Raymond, your granddad would be
so goddamn proud of you.

412
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:56,979
Thank you, Mr. Whiting.

413
00:26:57,215 --> 00:26:59,911
Raymond, this is J.B. Johnston,
from Manchurian Global.

414
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:01,176
- Hi. How are you?
- Pleasure.

415
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:02,944
And David Donovan,
their managing director.

416
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:05,520
And co-chair of
the U.S. International Policy Caucus.

417
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:06,850
Strong supporters, congressman.

418
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:09,724
They're desperate to be
of service to you, darling.

419
00:27:09,928 --> 00:27:11,759
Thank you, Mother,
I think you've earned your fee.

420
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:14,659
Oh, no. My plucky idealist.

421
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:17,861
So, gentlemen, how's business?

422
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:20,060
Not bad, Raymond.
Business is not bad.

423
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:21,636
It could always be better.

424
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,205
Any better and you guys
are gonna have

425
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:24,841
more assets than
the European Union.

426
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:26,101
Don't we already?

427
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:30,275
Every great society,
every great civilization,

428
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,507
always anchored by a great navy.

429
00:27:32,717 --> 00:27:34,378
- Congressman Shaw.
- Thanks very much.

430
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:37,453
Nice to see you, Bob.
Thanks for coming.

431
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:39,717
Congressman.

432
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:44,190
Ben Marco.

433
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:47,092
I know. Hello, captain.

434
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:49,198
How you doing?

435
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:52,199
- I need to talk to you.
- Okay.

436
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:55,005
Oh, my God, Raymond,
it's been so many years.

437
00:27:55,206 --> 00:27:56,673
- And?
- And I've been married,

438
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:58,069
- I've been divorced.
- Yeah.

439
00:27:58,276 --> 00:28:00,244
Well, you may have noticed
I've changed a bit myself.

440
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:04,040
No. No, that's not...
No, yes, I have noticed.

441
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:08,242
I see. It's great.
Congratulations.

442
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:09,943
My feelings haven't, though.

443
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:14,924
Changed, I mean.

444
00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:19,893
What feelings? What?

445
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:23,432
Jocelyn, I have never
stopped wondering

446
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:26,866
how things might have turned out
between us

447
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:29,700
- if my mother hadn't...
- Raymond.

448
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:32,433
Raymond, people can't just
rewrite their lives.

449
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:37,343
I haven't had a relationship...

450
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,915
...of any consequence
since we stopped seeing each other.

451
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:42,586
Doesn't that say something to you?

452
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:46,254
Yeah, that...

453
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:50,053
That you must be just about
the loneliest person on this earth.

454
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:54,591
Raymond, we were kids then. It must
have been, what, 15 years ago?

455
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:55,925
It was sweet, but...

456
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:58,200
Joce.

457
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:01,631
Yeah. I have to go.

458
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,307
Yeah.

459
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:04,975
Best of luck with the campaign.

460
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:06,701
Thank you.

461
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:12,450
Joce...

462
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:15,210
Sergeant Raymond Shaw.

463
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:21,450
I wanna talk to you too.

464
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:25,023
- Not now.
- Excuse me, sir.

465
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,720
I mean, I know you're busy,
congressman...

466
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:28,796
- Don't touch me.
- I'm sorry.

467
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,969
I'm sorry, it's just that, well...

468
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:34,138
Don't ever touch me.

469
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:40,771
Hello, major.
Have you tried the Pad Thai?

470
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:43,639
I'm told it rules.

471
00:29:51,689 --> 00:29:53,748
What were you hoping
Congressman Shaw would say?

472
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,888
I don't know, sir.

473
00:29:56,995 --> 00:30:01,125
It's not so much what he said
or didn't say, it was more of his...

474
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:02,959
...attitude, his demeanor.

475
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:04,730
Are you taking your meds?

476
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:07,131
Lieutenant Colonel Howard,
with all due respect,

477
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:09,306
I've had over a dozen years
of experts telling me

478
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:12,271
that I have Gulf War Syndrome,
I have post-traumatic stress disorder

479
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:15,674
and every other mood disorder
that you can name.

480
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,316
In those 12 years,
I've been a good soldier.

481
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:22,577
And I've denied what
every nerve ending in my body

482
00:30:22,787 --> 00:30:24,516
is telling me is more real than not.

483
00:30:24,722 --> 00:30:27,054
I've had one dream,
not variations on a dream,

484
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:28,816
the same dream.
Night after night...

485
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:32,087
No. No. I'm sorry.

486
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:34,765
You're saying that an entire squad
of U.S. Army soldiers

487
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:36,900
was hypnotized into believing
that Raymond Shaw

488
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:38,659
deserved the Medal of Honor.

489
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,598
And that somehow,
thanks to your dream,

490
00:30:41,806 --> 00:30:44,331
you're the only one
who knows the truth.

491
00:30:45,076 --> 00:30:48,136
Major Marco, you will stay clear
of Congressman Shaw.

492
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:56,552
And you are to resume
your medication.

493
00:30:56,754 --> 00:30:58,654
That is an order.

494
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,415
That will be all, major.

495
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:04,117
Somewhere right now, an
American soldier in the war on terror

496
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:06,661
is worried about his
family back home.

497
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:10,458
Somewhere right now,
in some small American town,

498
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:13,432
his grandmother is standing
in her kitchen.

499
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:16,198
She's got her medicine bottle
in one hand,

500
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:19,808
she's opening the refrigerator
with the other and she's thinking:

501
00:31:20,745 --> 00:31:23,043
"I can pay for my medicine...

502
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:26,277
...or I can pay for my dinner.

503
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:29,244
I can't do both."

504
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:31,618
I don't believe that our mothers
and grandmothers

505
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:34,883
should have to face that kind of
decision, not in this country.

506
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:40,124
I don't believe that the brave men
and women of our armed forces,

507
00:31:40,331 --> 00:31:42,891
risking their lives overseas,
should have to worry

508
00:31:43,701 --> 00:31:47,228
about their families back here
in America.

509
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:50,534
You see, there are some gaps
in this country...

510
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:54,610
...deep chasms
that we need to bridge.

511
00:31:56,447 --> 00:31:58,244
The gap between rich and poor,

512
00:31:58,616 --> 00:32:01,983
between government
and the people,

513
00:32:02,186 --> 00:32:05,553
between true security
and the notion of feeling safe.

514
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,987
Second floor, room three,
end of hall.

515
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:10,950
Between what is real...

516
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:12,652
Don't you just love this guy?

517
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:14,525
And what is not.

518
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:18,329
Tough choices are an unavoidable
element of leadership,

519
00:32:18,536 --> 00:32:21,096
I would just urge the governor
to remember that

520
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:24,867
the primary responsibility
of government...

521
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:49,128
Al Melvin.

522
00:32:51,402 --> 00:32:54,098
Al, it's Ben Marco.
Are you in there?

523
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,244
Fox is in the henhouse.

524
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:03,175
Weasel.

525
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:07,683
Weasel is...

526
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,481
The weasel is a weasel.

527
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:14,886
Sir, I'll be right outside.

528
00:33:15,626 --> 00:33:16,615
What?

529
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,489
I'll be right outside, sir.

530
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:21,696
I know.

531
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:24,958
- Good night.
- Good night, sir.

532
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:28,195
- Shall I get that for you, sir?
- No.

533
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:30,567
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

534
00:33:53,097 --> 00:33:55,429
You have 30 seconds, Mother.

535
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:56,998
Am I that predictable?

536
00:33:57,301 --> 00:33:59,201
You have no idea.

537
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:02,167
I'm calling to compliment you,
Mr. Grumpy.

538
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:05,342
I thought you were
magnificent tonight.

539
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:08,511
And so did all the network
campaign experts.

540
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:12,574
And that compassionate
vigilance thing

541
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:15,548
is working quite well for you.

542
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:19,280
- I might have to convert.
- I happen to believe in it.

543
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:21,014
Oh, yes, of course you do.

544
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:23,489
- Now, Raymond...
- Good night, Mother.

545
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:26,356
Raymond? What? No, wait, wait.

546
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:29,593
- Hang on a second.
- What? Raymond?

547
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:31,363
Are you there?

548
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:35,437
Yes?

549
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:37,672
Sergeant Shaw?

550
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,771
Who is this?

551
00:34:40,511 --> 00:34:43,605
- Sergeant Raymond Shaw?
- Yes.

552
00:34:43,948 --> 00:34:46,542
Raymond Prentiss Shaw?

553
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:53,279
Yes.

554
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:54,922
Listen.

555
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:57,051
Go to the bedroom of your suite.

556
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:00,958
Enter the hallway there.

557
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:04,760
Go to the end and open the closet.

558
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:36,260
Yes, thank you.

559
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:41,464
- Hello, Raymond.
- Hello.

560
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:43,571
Do you remember me?

561
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:49,746
No, sir, I don't.

562
00:35:50,014 --> 00:35:52,574
Brilliant. We've got 20 minutes
for our little checkup

563
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:55,616
from the neck up, gentlemen,
so if we could take his jacket.

564
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,720
Please sit down.

565
00:36:00,723 --> 00:36:03,385
No, Mr. Villalobos, I'm just...
The Army's got me gathering

566
00:36:03,593 --> 00:36:06,494
information on stress disorders,
so I'm just...

567
00:36:06,729 --> 00:36:10,130
...you know, just running statistics,
trying to find out about my old team...

568
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:15,961
Well, listen. Mr. Wilson,

569
00:36:16,205 --> 00:36:20,733
when Nathan came home,
was he preoccupied with Kuwait?

570
00:36:20,943 --> 00:36:22,570
I mean, did he have nightmares
or bad dreams

571
00:36:22,778 --> 00:36:24,473
about the firefight over there?

572
00:36:29,252 --> 00:36:33,882
You'll feel a little cold
as this anesthetic gel goes on.

573
00:36:38,895 --> 00:36:41,159
Probe sheath...

574
00:36:41,364 --> 00:36:44,197
...and probe.

575
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:50,238
Please relax.
Are you relaxed, Raymond?

576
00:36:50,473 --> 00:36:51,565
Yes, sir.

577
00:36:51,841 --> 00:36:56,574
Now, Raymond, I am going to drill
a tiny hole in the skull,

578
00:36:56,812 --> 00:37:00,680
which will allow delivery
of the new implant.

579
00:37:01,284 --> 00:37:04,344
So, what you'll feel is a little
discomfort in the form of pressure

580
00:37:04,554 --> 00:37:06,954
and also a loud vibrating noise
in your head,

581
00:37:07,156 --> 00:37:11,115
all of which, of course,
is completely normal.

582
00:39:13,149 --> 00:39:14,548
Thank you.

583
00:39:17,253 --> 00:39:20,086
Of course, as soon as this
or any task is completed,

584
00:39:20,289 --> 00:39:25,192
you will already have forgotten
that it ever actually took place.

585
00:39:26,095 --> 00:39:28,086
Probe going in now.

586
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,237
Good.

587
00:39:41,043 --> 00:39:42,840
Excellent.

588
00:39:43,045 --> 00:39:45,479
Releasing implant.

589
00:39:45,681 --> 00:39:48,172
There. That wasn't so bad,
was it, Raymond?

590
00:39:48,384 --> 00:39:49,681
No, sir.

591
00:39:50,352 --> 00:39:52,650
That's good. No decay, no slippage.

592
00:39:52,855 --> 00:39:57,053
Everything seems to be
in flawless working condition.

593
00:40:22,918 --> 00:40:24,852
Now, Raymond.

594
00:40:25,087 --> 00:40:28,648
Can you remember the deaths
of Private Baker and Private Ingram?

595
00:40:28,858 --> 00:40:29,847
Yes, sir.

596
00:40:30,092 --> 00:40:32,583
Good. Can you describe them
for me, please?

597
00:40:32,795 --> 00:40:35,855
We're on a routine recon
inside Iraqi-controlled terrain,

598
00:40:36,065 --> 00:40:38,556
assessing troop strength.

599
00:40:40,002 --> 00:40:44,371
"We're on a routine recon
inside Iraqi-controlled terrain,

600
00:40:44,573 --> 00:40:45,938
assessing troop strength."

601
00:40:46,142 --> 00:40:48,770
The mission ends without incident.
We're heading back...

602
00:40:48,978 --> 00:40:51,742
"Toward the command.
The night is clear. Stars..."

603
00:40:51,981 --> 00:40:55,348
The night is clear.
Stars, but no moon.

604
00:40:55,918 --> 00:40:57,180
The patrol is ambushed.

605
00:40:57,386 --> 00:41:00,617
We're engaged unexpectedly by
ground forces with helicopter support.

606
00:41:00,823 --> 00:41:03,656
RPG incoming, mortar fire.

607
00:41:03,993 --> 00:41:05,551
"Captain..."

608
00:41:07,163 --> 00:41:09,495
Captain Marco
is knocked unconscious.

609
00:41:09,698 --> 00:41:13,634
In the ensuing firefight, Eddie Ingram
gets himself separated to the left.

610
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:16,531
Baker goes after him.

611
00:41:16,739 --> 00:41:18,832
An incoming mortar shell
kills them both instantly

612
00:41:19,041 --> 00:41:22,477
before I am able to locate and
eliminate the source of the ordnance.

613
00:41:24,313 --> 00:41:27,680
Captain. Captain Marco.

614
00:41:27,883 --> 00:41:29,350
Help me.

615
00:41:37,026 --> 00:41:39,859
Pardon me. Is this seat taken?

616
00:41:40,496 --> 00:41:44,023
I see the captain enjoys
the road less traveled.

617
00:42:01,517 --> 00:42:03,576
Paper or plastic?

618
00:42:05,588 --> 00:42:08,853
Oh, come on.
From the grocery store.

619
00:42:09,058 --> 00:42:12,050
You know, at the checkout stand.
Paper or plastic girl, that's me.

620
00:42:12,261 --> 00:42:13,728
"Paper or plastic, sir?"

621
00:42:15,397 --> 00:42:16,830
I see you there all the time.

622
00:42:17,032 --> 00:42:19,523
Bennett Marco.
Checks from First National Bank.

623
00:42:19,735 --> 00:42:24,536
Romance novels, instant noodles,
NoDoz and tomatoes.

624
00:42:28,644 --> 00:42:31,408
So anyway, I'm on vacation.

625
00:42:31,614 --> 00:42:33,809
Holiday in the Big Apple
and all of that.

626
00:42:34,016 --> 00:42:36,450
And I saw you sitting here
and I said, "Hey,

627
00:42:36,652 --> 00:42:39,519
why not reach out
and touch someone?"

628
00:42:43,325 --> 00:42:46,226
So, what, I suppose
you're heading to New York City.

629
00:42:46,428 --> 00:42:48,555
Yeah, yeah, I'm... Yeah.

630
00:42:49,198 --> 00:42:51,598
Business? Pleasure? Both?

631
00:42:51,934 --> 00:42:56,962
Well, I'm just... I got an old friend
up there, an old Army friend that...

632
00:42:57,907 --> 00:43:00,808
Well, he's in politics now
and I'm just gonna

633
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:03,342
catch up on old times with him.

634
00:43:07,349 --> 00:43:08,873
I'm sorry, you said your name was...?

635
00:43:09,785 --> 00:43:11,218
Eugenie.

636
00:43:12,221 --> 00:43:13,813
What do your friends call you?

637
00:43:14,023 --> 00:43:16,150
My friends, they call me Rosie.

638
00:43:16,592 --> 00:43:18,583
- Rosie?
- Yeah, see, my full name is

639
00:43:18,794 --> 00:43:20,352
Eugenie Rose.
I like the Rosie part better.

640
00:43:20,562 --> 00:43:23,292
Eugenie is, well...

641
00:43:23,832 --> 00:43:25,390
...fragile.

642
00:43:25,768 --> 00:43:28,965
Yeah, but still, when I asked you
your name, you didn't say...

643
00:43:29,438 --> 00:43:31,303
What did you say?
You said Eugenie.

644
00:43:31,507 --> 00:43:33,702
Yeah, well...

645
00:43:34,276 --> 00:43:38,975
...maybe I was feeling fragile
at the time.

646
00:43:48,290 --> 00:43:49,757
Are you okay?

647
00:43:49,959 --> 00:43:51,290
Excuse me.

648
00:44:39,441 --> 00:44:40,840
Hello, captain.

649
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:43,009
Do you remember me?

650
00:45:15,244 --> 00:45:16,575
Ben.

651
00:45:17,479 --> 00:45:20,937
Hey. I'm gonna get a cab.
You want me to drop you somewhere?

652
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:22,344
No, I'm okay.

653
00:45:22,551 --> 00:45:24,348
Okay. So your friend's
gonna meet you here, then?

654
00:45:24,553 --> 00:45:25,918
No.

655
00:45:27,489 --> 00:45:28,888
All right.

656
00:45:29,091 --> 00:45:32,117
El Dorado 59970.

657
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:38,330
It's my cell phone number,
in case you ever... You know.

658
00:45:38,534 --> 00:45:40,525
I like to say it the old-fashioned way.

659
00:45:40,736 --> 00:45:44,103
Can you remember or should I write it
on your chest with a Sharpie?

660
00:45:44,973 --> 00:45:47,203
- I'll remember.
- Okay.

661
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:50,242
Hey, you're kind of...

662
00:45:50,913 --> 00:45:53,404
You need somewhere to go
to freshen up?

663
00:45:55,217 --> 00:45:56,878
Pentagon watchdogs
today accused

664
00:45:57,086 --> 00:45:59,486
the private equity fund
Manchurian Global

665
00:45:59,688 --> 00:46:03,522
of grossly overpricing plasma
and other critical medical supplies

666
00:46:03,725 --> 00:46:05,818
during the recent
Indonesian incursion,

667
00:46:06,028 --> 00:46:10,294
even as the company secured
a half-billion-dollar no-bid contract

668
00:46:10,499 --> 00:46:13,627
to provide combat support services
to American soldiers

669
00:46:13,836 --> 00:46:16,031
preparing to mobilize in Sri Lanka.

670
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:30,347
There you go.

671
00:46:31,153 --> 00:46:32,518
Come on in.

672
00:46:32,721 --> 00:46:35,281
This is my cousin's apartment.

673
00:46:35,724 --> 00:46:37,624
- Is she here?
- No.

674
00:46:37,826 --> 00:46:39,885
Be it ever so humble.

675
00:46:40,295 --> 00:46:42,525
No place like home, right?

676
00:46:42,764 --> 00:46:45,961
Believe it or not, there's a view.

677
00:46:46,168 --> 00:46:49,262
Go to the fire escape
and tilt your head up,

678
00:46:49,505 --> 00:46:51,700
you can almost see a tree.

679
00:46:53,842 --> 00:46:56,140
- Can I get you something to drink?
- No, I'm fine.

680
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:01,544
I've got some dieter's tea.

681
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:05,379
It's great for your metabolism,
if you're into that.

682
00:47:05,587 --> 00:47:10,547
Or some tomato juice. No? All right.

683
00:47:11,226 --> 00:47:12,887
Or...

684
00:47:13,095 --> 00:47:14,187
...some water?

685
00:47:14,663 --> 00:47:16,790
- No, thank you.
- I'm sorry.

686
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:20,391
I'm nervous.
I yak when I get nervous.

687
00:47:21,503 --> 00:47:23,266
Where is she, your cousin?

688
00:47:24,606 --> 00:47:26,574
She's on tour with Dreamgirls.

689
00:47:37,853 --> 00:47:39,047
Hey, are you okay?

690
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:43,055
Yeah.

691
00:47:45,861 --> 00:47:48,921
Look, I'm sorry about
what happened earlier.

692
00:47:49,131 --> 00:47:51,656
You don't have to apologize to me.

693
00:47:52,701 --> 00:47:54,862
I'll make you some tea.

694
00:48:33,909 --> 00:48:37,401
Jesus. Where's the lemon? Okay.

695
00:48:38,113 --> 00:48:41,810
- You okay in there?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

696
00:48:42,417 --> 00:48:45,716
You know, I left you some towels
in there, did you see them?

697
00:48:49,691 --> 00:48:51,818
- What was that?
- Dropped my bag.

698
00:48:59,434 --> 00:49:00,901
Ben?

699
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:03,967
Are you okay in there?

700
00:49:04,439 --> 00:49:05,770
Earth to Ben.

701
00:49:06,508 --> 00:49:07,873
Yeah.

702
00:49:08,143 --> 00:49:11,306
- You sure everything's all right?
- Yes.

703
00:49:14,216 --> 00:49:15,740
Ben?

704
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:26,787
Ben?

705
00:49:27,496 --> 00:49:29,259
Ben?

706
00:49:30,165 --> 00:49:31,359
Ben.

707
00:49:35,871 --> 00:49:37,270
Ben?

708
00:50:00,862 --> 00:50:02,193
What are you doing?

709
00:50:06,601 --> 00:50:08,296
Did you see that?

710
00:50:12,107 --> 00:50:14,234
What I had in my hand.

711
00:50:18,313 --> 00:50:21,146
I wasn't hallucinating, Delp.
I held it in my hand.

712
00:50:21,350 --> 00:50:23,716
That's what they all say, Marco.

713
00:50:23,952 --> 00:50:27,012
Some wicked shit got sprayed
on you guys during Desert Storm.

714
00:50:27,589 --> 00:50:30,717
Besides all the depleted uranium,
I mean.

715
00:50:31,393 --> 00:50:33,452
I personally know of
a couple of Rangers

716
00:50:33,662 --> 00:50:36,426
who swear that they see only
in tertiary colors now,

717
00:50:36,631 --> 00:50:39,691
- Delp.
- And can pick up sports talk radio

718
00:50:39,901 --> 00:50:43,359
in their cortical block if they get
too close to a Con-Ed transformer.

719
00:50:43,772 --> 00:50:45,672
It's not Gulf War Syndrome.

720
00:50:52,514 --> 00:50:58,646
The Army did try this
tiny, implantable ID thing.

721
00:51:00,455 --> 00:51:03,515
You could imbed it under the skin,
then scan it like a bar code

722
00:51:03,725 --> 00:51:06,353
for medical emergency information:

723
00:51:06,795 --> 00:51:09,025
Blood type, DNA.

724
00:51:09,231 --> 00:51:11,290
Well, the Army never put one in me.

725
00:51:15,103 --> 00:51:17,367
That you know of, man.

726
00:51:19,875 --> 00:51:21,638
That you know of.

727
00:51:32,354 --> 00:51:35,619
U.S. Planes bombed selected sites
in Guinea today, acting on intelligence

728
00:51:35,824 --> 00:51:39,191
that the African nation's military
regime had secretly resumed

729
00:51:39,394 --> 00:51:41,021
its chemical weapons program.

730
00:51:41,229 --> 00:51:43,424
The secretary of defense declined
to comment on the attack,

731
00:51:43,632 --> 00:51:45,532
saying only that the mission
was successful,

732
00:51:45,734 --> 00:51:48,760
targets acquired, that all American
personnel involved here

733
00:51:48,970 --> 00:51:52,406
- were home safe and sound.
- Striking transportation workers...

734
00:51:53,608 --> 00:51:58,011
My dreams seem more real to me

735
00:51:58,213 --> 00:52:01,614
than what I actually remember
happening over there. It's like...

736
00:52:03,852 --> 00:52:09,290
It's like somewhere along the line
I got brainwashed or something and...

737
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:14,424
I'm just, like, all scrambled up.

738
00:52:15,597 --> 00:52:17,622
We have all been
brainwashed, Marco.

739
00:52:18,834 --> 00:52:22,201
As for somebody
imbedding electric probes

740
00:52:22,404 --> 00:52:26,966
and computer chips in your brain
to make you do things,

741
00:52:27,209 --> 00:52:29,040
it's horseshit, man.

742
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:33,213
A little electroshock...

743
00:52:34,149 --> 00:52:37,710
...and sleep deprivation will do
the trick for a fraction of the price.

744
00:52:37,919 --> 00:52:39,910
Ask the Uzbeks.

745
00:52:41,122 --> 00:52:43,090
What about my dreams?

746
00:52:44,392 --> 00:52:47,623
What if all this is your dream...

747
00:52:48,730 --> 00:52:51,665
...and you are really
still back in Kuwait?

748
00:53:15,590 --> 00:53:18,753
- Thanks for coming out. Thank you.
- Congressman!

749
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:20,518
- Congressman!
- Congressman!

750
00:53:20,729 --> 00:53:23,391
Congressman! Congressman!
Why do you and Governor Arthur

751
00:53:23,598 --> 00:53:25,395
oppose deploying troops
into Indonesia?

752
00:53:25,634 --> 00:53:27,067
Well, Governor Arthur and I believe

753
00:53:27,269 --> 00:53:28,998
we can't clean up the world
with dirty hands.

754
00:53:29,204 --> 00:53:30,865
Sergeant Shaw!

755
00:53:32,607 --> 00:53:34,336
Do you ever dream about Kuwait?

756
00:53:34,676 --> 00:53:36,473
Captain Marco.

757
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:40,143
It's okay. It's okay.

758
00:53:40,348 --> 00:53:41,838
Nice to see you, sir.

759
00:53:42,083 --> 00:53:44,483
Good evening.
It's good to see you too.

760
00:53:44,786 --> 00:53:46,253
Why did you ask me about Kuwait?

761
00:53:46,454 --> 00:53:47,944
I didn't.
I asked you about your dreams.

762
00:53:48,156 --> 00:53:49,453
- Thank you, Lily.
- Congressman Shaw, I'm sorry.

763
00:53:49,658 --> 00:53:52,024
They wanna know if you can do
an interview with Larry King at 6?

764
00:53:52,227 --> 00:53:53,785
- No, no.
- No to the interview or no to 6?

765
00:53:53,995 --> 00:53:55,485
No. He wants to talk
about my mother. No.

766
00:53:55,697 --> 00:53:57,528
- Everything under control, P.J.?
- Hello, sir.

767
00:53:57,766 --> 00:53:59,461
Good to see you.

768
00:53:59,701 --> 00:54:01,669
So, captain, what can I do for you?

769
00:54:01,870 --> 00:54:03,303
I just need a few minutes
of your time.

770
00:54:03,505 --> 00:54:04,767
Congressman Shaw,
a moment, please?

771
00:54:04,973 --> 00:54:05,940
Private time.

772
00:54:06,141 --> 00:54:08,837
Unfortunately, this is as private
as it gets for me now.

773
00:54:09,044 --> 00:54:10,568
- I understand.
- He's all right, Will.

774
00:54:10,779 --> 00:54:12,804
- Come on in.
- Thank you, thank you.

775
00:54:14,316 --> 00:54:17,012
- Hey, George.
- There are these dreams

776
00:54:17,218 --> 00:54:19,982
that some of the men
from our unit have been having.

777
00:54:20,188 --> 00:54:21,519
Including you?

778
00:54:21,723 --> 00:54:23,020
Well...

779
00:54:23,625 --> 00:54:26,685
...it's more of a question
of what actually happened

780
00:54:26,895 --> 00:54:28,920
the night that our patrol
got attacked.

781
00:54:29,464 --> 00:54:33,730
That's easy. We're on a routine recon
inside Iraqi-controlled terrain.

782
00:54:33,935 --> 00:54:36,563
The patrol is ambushed.
RPG incoming, mortar fire.

783
00:54:36,771 --> 00:54:39,001
- You're knocked...
- Unconscious. Exactly the way...

784
00:54:39,207 --> 00:54:42,142
Not to cut you off, but I mean,
exactly the way that I remember it.

785
00:54:42,344 --> 00:54:45,177
But I dreamed something else.

786
00:54:46,781 --> 00:54:48,271
Am I in your dreams, captain?

787
00:54:49,217 --> 00:54:50,809
Yes, you are, congressman.

788
00:54:51,152 --> 00:54:52,278
Saving everybody?

789
00:54:52,487 --> 00:54:55,479
It's a whole lot more complicated
than that. Now, Corporal Melvin,

790
00:54:55,690 --> 00:54:58,158
he's been drawing these pictures
and he wrote down what he dreams.

791
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:00,294
- Maybe if you just...
- I don't have dreams, captain.

792
00:55:01,229 --> 00:55:04,130
At all? You don't dream at all?
Everybody dreams, right? I mean...

793
00:55:04,332 --> 00:55:06,664
Look, captain, I'd like to help you,
I would, I really would,

794
00:55:06,868 --> 00:55:08,665
but I think you ought to
see somebody.

795
00:55:08,870 --> 00:55:10,929
- Somebody who specializes in...
- I've been to doctors.

796
00:55:11,439 --> 00:55:13,031
Well, good, that's very good,

797
00:55:13,241 --> 00:55:15,801
because they can probably
help you out a lot more than I can.

798
00:55:16,044 --> 00:55:17,671
- I don't know, but...
- Take care, captain.

799
00:55:17,879 --> 00:55:20,473
- Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
- Thanks for coming by.

800
00:55:26,955 --> 00:55:28,684
I'm not crazy, Shaw.

801
00:55:32,927 --> 00:55:34,451
Major.

802
00:55:36,665 --> 00:55:40,533
- Ben. Are you hungry?
- Starving.

803
00:55:46,207 --> 00:55:47,606
Well, it depends on the demographic.

804
00:55:47,842 --> 00:55:49,139
Excuse me.

805
00:55:50,645 --> 00:55:52,579
- I killed Baker?
- Well, it's a dream.

806
00:55:52,781 --> 00:55:54,908
I mean, it could mean
something else.

807
00:55:55,383 --> 00:55:57,715
It could mean I'm supposed
to think you did.

808
00:55:57,919 --> 00:56:01,787
No, I killed the enemy.
I didn't know them either, so...

809
00:56:02,157 --> 00:56:03,818
...it was okay.

810
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:07,494
And anyway, I remember what we did
in Kuwait. I remember it perfectly.

811
00:56:07,696 --> 00:56:08,924
I just...

812
00:56:09,431 --> 00:56:11,865
...don't remember actually doing it.

813
00:56:12,634 --> 00:56:14,295
Maybe you didn't do it.

814
00:56:21,309 --> 00:56:22,799
No.

815
00:56:23,778 --> 00:56:25,370
What a thought.

816
00:56:43,498 --> 00:56:44,931
What?

817
00:56:49,738 --> 00:56:51,797
Life is so bizarre, isn't it?

818
00:56:52,841 --> 00:56:54,433
Which part?

819
00:56:54,642 --> 00:56:57,110
I don't know.
What you saw downstairs.

820
00:56:57,579 --> 00:57:03,518
This campaign. Politics.
My whole public life and persona.

821
00:57:05,053 --> 00:57:08,853
I mean, posing and grinning
like a goddamn sock puppet,

822
00:57:09,057 --> 00:57:11,719
shaking hands with total strangers
who must be completely blind

823
00:57:11,926 --> 00:57:14,326
if they can't see
what I am at the core.

824
00:57:14,529 --> 00:57:17,464
What my mother has made me.
A Prentiss.

825
00:57:17,665 --> 00:57:19,929
Ferociously a Prentiss.

826
00:57:20,502 --> 00:57:22,270
- But not a Shaw. No, sir.
- I see.

827
00:57:22,370 --> 00:57:23,828
- But not a Shaw. No, sir.
- I see.

828
00:57:24,372 --> 00:57:25,930
No, you don't.

829
00:57:26,908 --> 00:57:28,102
You can't.

830
00:57:30,578 --> 00:57:32,546
I was 20 years old
before I had a friend.

831
00:57:32,747 --> 00:57:38,743
Worse, a girlfriend. Well, you know,
from my point of view, anyway.

832
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:43,022
A friend outside of my mother's circle
of approved encounters

833
00:57:43,224 --> 00:57:45,351
and she...

834
00:57:47,729 --> 00:57:49,424
...my mother...

835
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:56,960
God only knows what she told
Jocelyn to chase her away.

836
00:57:57,505 --> 00:58:00,133
Precipitating my sole act
of rebellion:

837
00:58:00,341 --> 00:58:02,172
Storming off...

838
00:58:02,977 --> 00:58:05,468
...and enlisting in the Army.

839
00:58:08,883 --> 00:58:10,316
But after the war...

840
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:14,515
...I came back to her.

841
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:18,386
Why did you come back?
What happened?

842
00:58:22,997 --> 00:58:24,794
Weren't you listening?

843
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,468
Mother happened.

844
00:58:28,670 --> 00:58:30,900
You know, the truth is I hate it.

845
00:58:31,339 --> 00:58:33,637
I've always despised the Medal.

846
00:58:34,242 --> 00:58:37,609
The cloying adulation
of the little people.

847
00:58:38,613 --> 00:58:40,911
It's certainly...

848
00:58:41,149 --> 00:58:43,743
...nothing for you
to be jealous of, major.

849
00:58:43,952 --> 00:58:45,317
I'm not jealous.

850
00:58:46,287 --> 00:58:48,084
I don't have the dreams, Ben.

851
00:58:48,556 --> 00:58:52,925
How could you not remember
saving our unit?

852
00:58:53,494 --> 00:58:54,927
I do. I said I did.

853
00:58:55,129 --> 00:58:58,690
No, no, you didn't. You said
that you didn't remember doing it.

854
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:01,232
That's what you just said
a couple minutes ago.

855
00:59:02,971 --> 00:59:05,166
When I think about that night...

856
00:59:06,774 --> 00:59:09,436
...it's as if I know what will happen.

857
00:59:10,678 --> 00:59:12,373
The thing is, I never seem
to get to the point

858
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:15,811
where I feel that it actually
does happen.

859
00:59:16,017 --> 00:59:17,848
But I'm sure that's perfectly normal.

860
00:59:18,152 --> 00:59:21,747
Okay. Well, have you discussed this
with anyone? These discrepancies?

861
00:59:22,123 --> 00:59:24,318
Who would I share that with?

862
00:59:25,059 --> 00:59:27,425
My old Army buddies
who love and adore me

863
00:59:27,629 --> 00:59:29,756
for saving their
pathetically unimportant,

864
00:59:29,964 --> 00:59:32,432
present company excluded, asses?

865
00:59:32,901 --> 00:59:34,960
You could discuss it
with Army intelligence.

866
00:59:35,169 --> 00:59:38,570
You could go down there.
I mean, I could go with you

867
00:59:38,773 --> 00:59:40,968
and discuss it and you can tell them
what you remember,

868
00:59:41,175 --> 00:59:44,144
what you don't remember,
and they could...

869
00:59:44,879 --> 00:59:46,642
...run some tests.

870
00:59:49,384 --> 00:59:51,784
Yeah, tests. Boy.

871
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:54,011
The press would have
a field day with that.

872
00:59:54,689 --> 00:59:57,385
Somebody put an implant inside me.
I found it this morning.

873
00:59:57,592 --> 00:59:59,822
I've got the hole in my back
if you wanna take a look at it.

874
01:00:00,028 --> 01:00:02,588
And I got a good feeling
they put one in you too.

875
01:00:08,636 --> 01:00:10,297
Nobody has put anything
in me, Ben.

876
01:00:10,505 --> 01:00:12,632
Let's prove it.
Why don't, you know...

877
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:14,432
- We'll go get an x-ray...
- Look, Ben,

878
01:00:14,642 --> 01:00:16,439
I wanna be supportive of you. I do.

879
01:00:16,644 --> 01:00:19,238
But don't you think this could wait
till after the election?

880
01:00:19,447 --> 01:00:20,607
Why? For what?

881
01:00:20,815 --> 01:00:22,874
- What are you scared of?
- I'm not afraid of anything.

882
01:00:23,084 --> 01:00:25,848
- Then why don't we just prove it...
- Know what? I think you should leave.

883
01:00:26,054 --> 01:00:28,614
- I'm sorry, I really...
- Listen.

884
01:00:28,823 --> 01:00:33,624
Somebody got into our heads
with big steel-toe boots,

885
01:00:33,828 --> 01:00:36,296
cable cutters and a chainsaw
and they went to town.

886
01:00:36,497 --> 01:00:39,955
Neurons got... Got...
Got exposed and circuits got rewired.

887
01:00:40,168 --> 01:00:42,898
Our brain cells got
obliterated, Raymond.

888
01:00:43,104 --> 01:00:44,662
Please.

889
01:00:45,573 --> 01:00:47,541
You need to get help, Ben.

890
01:00:48,343 --> 01:00:50,573
What are you doing? Ben!

891
01:00:54,816 --> 01:00:56,511
Stop! Stop!

892
01:00:56,818 --> 01:00:58,012
Inside! Inside!

893
01:01:04,025 --> 01:01:05,014
Congressman!

894
01:01:10,898 --> 01:01:12,695
He bit him. He bit him.

895
01:01:17,171 --> 01:01:18,832
Get him out of here.

896
01:01:26,547 --> 01:01:28,139
Are you okay, sir?

897
01:01:30,752 --> 01:01:32,185
- Leave me alone.
- Sir, we should...

898
01:01:32,387 --> 01:01:33,945
Get out!

899
01:02:08,222 --> 01:02:09,951
We fished him out of
the Potomac River

900
01:02:10,158 --> 01:02:13,059
about 4:45 yesterday afternoon.

901
01:02:14,162 --> 01:02:17,029
What were you doing
in Al Melvin's apartment?

902
01:02:18,199 --> 01:02:19,723
I went to talk to him.
He wasn't home.

903
01:02:19,934 --> 01:02:22,926
Talk about what? Dreams?

904
01:02:25,873 --> 01:02:27,363
Interesting stuff.

905
01:02:27,575 --> 01:02:30,601
Yeah, there's hundreds
of those in his place.

906
01:02:30,812 --> 01:02:32,074
You should have your people
check it out.

907
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:33,747
Oh, we'll get on that right away.

908
01:02:33,948 --> 01:02:37,281
Colonel Garret was kind enough
to show us the file on you, Marco.

909
01:02:37,485 --> 01:02:40,784
You are the real deal, aren't you?

910
01:02:42,056 --> 01:02:45,082
Special Forces. Rangers. Delta.

911
01:02:47,095 --> 01:02:48,858
I wanted to talk to Corporal Melvin

912
01:02:49,063 --> 01:02:52,931
to ask him some
unanswered questions about...

913
01:02:53,134 --> 01:02:55,796
...our reconnaissance
in Kuwait back in '91.

914
01:02:56,003 --> 01:02:57,868
- He wasn't home.
- Right. He wasn't there.

915
01:02:58,072 --> 01:03:01,599
So, what, you thought it was okay
to just break in and wait for him?

916
01:03:01,809 --> 01:03:03,276
I didn't kill him,
if that's where you're headed.

917
01:03:03,478 --> 01:03:05,139
Nobody said you did.

918
01:03:05,346 --> 01:03:06,836
Maybe he committed suicide.

919
01:03:08,916 --> 01:03:10,713
What's your obsession
with Raymond Shaw?

920
01:03:10,918 --> 01:03:12,476
I'm not obsessed
with Raymond Shaw.

921
01:03:12,687 --> 01:03:14,348
The man of his dreams.

922
01:03:15,890 --> 01:03:17,687
You may want to ask
your medical examiners

923
01:03:17,892 --> 01:03:19,757
to check Melvin's back.

924
01:03:19,961 --> 01:03:21,622
It's under the skin
just shy of the scapula.

925
01:03:21,829 --> 01:03:24,662
They may find an implant.

926
01:03:24,866 --> 01:03:26,527
Just under the skin, left side.

927
01:03:26,734 --> 01:03:28,964
If they don't look real hard,
they won't find it.

928
01:03:29,504 --> 01:03:31,836
They could sing that while
they're looking for it if they like.

929
01:03:32,039 --> 01:03:33,904
- Implants.
- That's what I said.

930
01:03:34,108 --> 01:03:35,769
I-M-plant.

931
01:03:35,977 --> 01:03:40,676
Yeah, but judging from
your file here, apparently,

932
01:03:40,882 --> 01:03:43,316
you don't know your shit
from your oatmeal, my friend.

933
01:03:43,518 --> 01:03:45,145
Excuse me. This is unnecessary.

934
01:03:45,887 --> 01:03:47,354
You got a problem?

935
01:03:48,456 --> 01:03:51,721
Psycho? You look a little angry.

936
01:03:52,927 --> 01:03:55,691
Maybe you wanna hit me?
Go ahead, you can do it.

937
01:03:56,864 --> 01:03:59,560
- Hey!
- For God's sake, Ben...

938
01:04:01,202 --> 01:04:02,260
He hit me.

939
01:04:03,538 --> 01:04:05,267
And you wanna help him?

940
01:04:05,473 --> 01:04:09,102
No. That would be political suicide.
Of course not.

941
01:04:09,610 --> 01:04:11,578
I want you to help him.

942
01:04:14,282 --> 01:04:17,445
I can't even imagine why.

943
01:04:18,186 --> 01:04:21,349
Mother, I can assure you, I am as
uncomfortable asking you to do this

944
01:04:21,556 --> 01:04:23,717
as you are being asked.

945
01:04:24,058 --> 01:04:26,652
My campaign people are getting
a restraining order against him.

946
01:04:26,861 --> 01:04:30,092
He's going on every security watch list,
but I won't lock him up.

947
01:04:30,298 --> 01:04:32,960
- I'm not pressing charges.
- What?

948
01:04:33,167 --> 01:04:35,328
I don't know, it's just...

949
01:04:38,906 --> 01:04:40,339
I don't wanna talk
about this right now.

950
01:04:40,541 --> 01:04:42,338
Can we get back to the campaign
and focus on something...

951
01:04:42,543 --> 01:04:45,944
Raymond, you don't actually
believe his story?

952
01:04:47,815 --> 01:04:49,646
No.

953
01:04:50,184 --> 01:04:52,243
But he does.

954
01:04:53,821 --> 01:04:56,255
And he's a fine soldier.

955
01:04:57,291 --> 01:05:00,021
And if his slim hold
on sanity requires

956
01:05:00,228 --> 01:05:02,696
that I tolerate his delusions
until he can get help, I'll do it.

957
01:05:02,897 --> 01:05:04,524
It doesn't diminish me.

958
01:05:05,132 --> 01:05:07,066
I'm not afraid of him.

959
01:05:08,202 --> 01:05:09,692
Raymond.

960
01:05:17,378 --> 01:05:20,973
How much do you actually know
about your friend?

961
01:05:52,446 --> 01:05:54,380
Oh, that's sad.

962
01:05:54,582 --> 01:05:56,482
Poor little tin soldier.

963
01:05:56,684 --> 01:05:58,379
Mother, please.

964
01:05:58,586 --> 01:06:01,180
Well, just imagine how terrified
your people were yesterday

965
01:06:01,389 --> 01:06:03,721
when Major Marco showed up
at campaign headquarters

966
01:06:03,924 --> 01:06:05,516
and you invite...

967
01:06:05,726 --> 01:06:07,819
My God, you invited him in.

968
01:06:08,462 --> 01:06:09,929
With all they know about him.

969
01:06:10,931 --> 01:06:12,865
I know him.

970
01:06:13,467 --> 01:06:15,435
I served under him.
He was a good man.

971
01:06:15,636 --> 01:06:18,833
Well, that's what the neighbors
always say about serial killers.

972
01:06:27,782 --> 01:06:30,615
You're out of here.
Shaw won't press charges.
