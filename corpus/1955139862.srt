And it's a fucking good thing
I knew those tricks,

because my life sucked dick.

204
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,639

at a skateboard magazine
in California.

"We will shoot that."

00:11:46,647 --> 00:11:48,725

"Hey, this isn't just for

00:11:52,547 --> 00:11:55,696

225
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:03,587

00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:06,578
I mean,
I was fucking ready.

227
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:09,668
The first thing I did
was I moved out to LA,

228
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,668
and when I got there
we jumped on an airplane

229
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:14,679
and flew to Europe
to go film a special episode

230
00:12:14,681 --> 00:12:17,589
racing cars through
all these countries.

231
00:12:17,591 --> 00:12:20,720
Now, I knew we were gonna
be in the car for five days,

232
00:12:20,722 --> 00:12:23,620
so I challenged my
<i>Jackass</i> buddy Chris Pontius

233
00:12:23,622 --> 00:12:25,691
to a friendly competition

234
00:12:25,693 --> 00:12:28,691
to see who could ejaculate
the most times

235
00:12:28,693 --> 00:12:32,562
in the car
while it was full of dudes

236
00:12:32,564 --> 00:12:35,662
and driving down
the road.

237
00:12:35,664 --> 00:12:38,503
Those were the rules.

238
00:12:38,505 --> 00:12:40,503
So the race begins
in London, England.

239
00:12:40,505 --> 00:12:41,593
Fireworks go off.

240
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:43,613
The cars peel out.

241
00:12:43,615 --> 00:12:45,664
Pontius and I
start tugging.

242
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:47,684

243
00:12:47,686 --> 00:12:49,674
But it was
broad daylight outside,

244
00:12:49,676 --> 00:12:51,625
and our buddies
were wide awake.

245
00:12:51,627 --> 00:12:54,615
We couldn't even
get boners.

246
00:12:54,617 --> 00:12:56,535
But that didn't stop us.

247
00:12:56,537 --> 00:12:58,716
We are yanking on our wet
noodles, just giggling,

248
00:12:58,718 --> 00:13:00,686
"Aah!"

249
00:13:00,688 --> 00:13:02,666
And London's got all those
double-decker buses,

250
00:13:02,668 --> 00:13:04,697
so every one of them
that goes by

251
00:13:04,699 --> 00:13:07,567
everybody on the top deck
is just looking right down.

252
00:13:07,569 --> 00:13:10,548
"Aghh!"

253
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,518
And we just wouldn't quit.

254
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,558
We're literally sweating
profusely, just drenched.

255
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,619
I gave myself an abrasion.

256
00:13:18,621 --> 00:13:19,729
We got to the coast
of England,

257
00:13:19,731 --> 00:13:21,609
drove the car onto a train,

258
00:13:21,611 --> 00:13:22,689
which went underneath
the ocean

259
00:13:22,691 --> 00:13:24,610
and spit us out into France.

260
00:13:24,612 --> 00:13:26,530
Still jacking.

where it was
the dark of night.

265
00:13:34,543 --> 00:13:37,632
Pontius had fallen asleep
next to me in the backseat.

266
00:13:37,634 --> 00:13:39,732

in the passenger seat

267
00:13:39,734 --> 00:13:41,672

268
00:13:41,674 --> 00:13:43,573
The producer dude was awake,

269
00:13:43,575 --> 00:13:44,733
but he's driving,
looking forward.

270
00:13:44,735 --> 00:13:46,683
I had some privacy.

271
00:13:46,685 --> 00:13:49,704
I was able to take myself
on a date.

272
00:13:49,706 --> 00:13:51,714

273
00:13:51,716 --> 00:13:53,734
And it's working,
and I can feel it,

274
00:13:53,736 --> 00:13:57,675
and there is so much power
behind that load

275
00:13:57,677 --> 00:14:01,525
after all of that tugging
and trying.

276
00:14:01,527 --> 00:14:05,586
When I finally blasted it
into that car window,

277
00:14:05,588 --> 00:14:07,666
it's a wonder I didn't
break the fucking thing.

278
00:14:07,668 --> 00:14:09,747

it was like I shot it

279
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:11,627

Bow-bow-bow-bow!

281
00:14:13,569 --> 00:14:15,698
It was incredible,
and I couldn't believe it.

282
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,668
I just woke up
Johnny Knoxville,

283
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:18,748
"Dude, Knoxville, get up!

284
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,728
Grab the camera, man.
Film this!"

285
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:23,679
I wanted him to hurry before
it all drizzled down too far,

286
00:14:23,681 --> 00:14:25,569
you know?

287
00:14:25,571 --> 00:14:27,590
And so Knoxville's
just filming

288
00:14:27,592 --> 00:14:28,670
all this come,

289
00:14:28,672 --> 00:14:31,600
panning across it
while he asks,

290
00:14:31,602 --> 00:14:34,661
"What's that
on the window, Steve-O?"

291
00:14:34,663 --> 00:14:36,741
And when he gets to me,
I go,

292
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:39,681
"I don't know,"
you know?

293
00:14:39,683 --> 00:14:41,712
So we filmed load after load.

294
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,652
"Pontius, what's that
on your race suit?"

295
00:14:44,654 --> 00:14:47,723
"Beats me,"
you know?

296
00:14:47,725 --> 00:14:51,723
And MTV didn't end up showing

297
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:54,534
a single one.

298
00:14:54,536 --> 00:14:56,604
[audience boos]

299
00:14:56,606 --> 00:14:59,645
There were eight of them,
by the way, all right?

300
00:14:59,647 --> 00:15:02,735
We were tied
four loads apiece.

301
00:15:02,737 --> 00:15:05,555
But it wasn't long
before I earned myself

302
00:15:05,557 --> 00:15:07,716
a reputation as a guy
who would do fucking anything,

303
00:15:07,718 --> 00:15:09,756
back out of nothing.

304
00:15:09,758 --> 00:15:12,647
But then we were filming
the first movie,

305
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:15,737
and I'm supposed to shove
a toy car up my ass.

306
00:15:15,739 --> 00:15:18,677
I had put things
in my butt.

307
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:22,738
Fireworks, chicken, fish.

308
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,639
I would never do that again,
because I'm vegan now.

309
00:15:25,641 --> 00:15:27,759
[chuckles]

310
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:30,669
But I had never really
popped my butt cherry.

311
00:15:30,671 --> 00:15:31,759
I didn't care.

312
00:15:31,761 --> 00:15:33,760

you know?

313
00:15:33,762 --> 00:15:35,710

I drank so much,

314
00:15:35,712 --> 00:15:37,620
and my butt hurts,
like, you know?

315
00:15:37,622 --> 00:15:39,551
I need a..."
[chuckles]

316
00:15:39,553 --> 00:15:43,551
Thing was that I accidentally
told my dad the idea,

317
00:15:43,553 --> 00:15:47,752
and something about
the way he said, "Oh, no..."

318
00:15:47,754 --> 00:15:50,532
He's, like, a super
successful businessman.

319
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:51,633
I know that's surprising,

320
00:15:51,635 --> 00:15:53,583
but he could handle
a lot of things.

321
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:56,543
A car up my butt was, like,
over the line.

322
00:15:56,545 --> 00:15:58,544
So I told Johnny Knoxville
and the guys,

323
00:15:58,546 --> 00:16:00,634
"I can't do it.
I gotta back out," you know?

324
00:16:00,636 --> 00:16:03,624
I said, "Instead,
I think I can drink

325
00:16:03,626 --> 00:16:05,545
a whole beer through my nose.

326
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:06,715
If you make me a beer bong
where the hose

327
00:16:06,717 --> 00:16:08,715
forks into two thinner hoses,

328
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:11,536
I'll put one in each nostril."

329
00:16:11,538 --> 00:16:12,726
So they made it for me.

330
00:16:12,728 --> 00:16:15,576
I showed up to the set.
I poured the beer into it.

331
00:16:15,578 --> 00:16:17,547
Stuck the hoses in my nose
and...

332
00:16:17,549 --> 00:16:18,717
[snorting]

333
00:16:18,719 --> 00:16:20,667
I'm telling you,
I pounded that beer so fast,

334
00:16:20,669 --> 00:16:22,597
it was amazing,

335
00:16:22,599 --> 00:16:24,718
but none of the other guys
even giggled,

336
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,618
and then Knoxville said,

337
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,618
"That sucked.

338
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,709
Stick it up your ass."

339
00:16:30,711 --> 00:16:32,659
[chuckles]

340
00:16:32,661 --> 00:16:34,699
To which
I immediately replied,

341
00:16:34,701 --> 00:16:36,570
"We already established,

342
00:16:36,572 --> 00:16:39,620
I don't put shit
up my butt!"

343
00:16:39,622 --> 00:16:41,570
Which would have
got me off the hook.

344
00:16:41,572 --> 00:16:43,611
If I left it there,
I would've been free and clear.

345
00:16:43,613 --> 00:16:45,561
But then I foolishly added,

346
00:16:45,563 --> 00:16:46,771
"And it probably
wouldn't work anyway."

347
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:49,612
[laughs]

348
00:16:49,614 --> 00:16:51,572
But now we gotta
find out if it works,

349
00:16:51,574 --> 00:16:54,672
because we're scientists,
you know?

350
00:16:54,674 --> 00:16:57,703
So I realized
I fucked myself, you know?

351
00:16:57,705 --> 00:16:59,753
Literally.

352
00:16:59,755 --> 00:17:01,773
And they chopped off
the thinner hoses,

353
00:17:01,775 --> 00:17:03,624
so I'm staring down
the barrel

354
00:17:03,626 --> 00:17:06,746
of a dick-thick,
girthy-ass beer bong hose.

355
00:17:08,677 --> 00:17:10,605
And if you think
you know this story

356
00:17:10,607 --> 00:17:12,545
because you saw the butt
chug in the second movie,

357
00:17:12,547 --> 00:17:13,605
I'll remind you,
this was the first.

358
00:17:13,607 --> 00:17:14,695
Nobody saw this.

359
00:17:14,697 --> 00:17:16,716
I started off
by getting

360
00:17:16,718 --> 00:17:20,656
butt-ass
dick and balls naked.

in the public parking lot

364

beer bong hose

365
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:35,669
and I just went for it
full force.

366
00:17:35,671 --> 00:17:37,569

370
00:17:45,752 --> 00:17:49,651
standing around watch it
go in that easy,

371
00:17:49,653 --> 00:17:51,741

on drugs and alcohol

372

that beer into my butthole

381

really happening.

385
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:31,587

all of the above and kick.

386

the level of beer drops.

387

now I'm wiggling around,

392

393
00:18:47,612 --> 00:18:49,620
Sure enough,
I get a rhythm going.

394

guzzling that shit, right?

But I don't know if it was
because I hadn't slept.

397

For three days,

398
00:19:00,664 --> 00:19:04,623
I had done nothing
but cocaine

399
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,783
and wash it down
with liquor.

400
00:19:06,785 --> 00:19:08,773
For some reason,

401
00:19:08,775 --> 00:19:11,734
as much as this beer's
going in my asshole,

402
00:19:11,736 --> 00:19:16,614

yeasty, cloudy,

403

like, right into the hose.

You can see it,

405
00:19:21,637 --> 00:19:23,795
that beer was getting
murkier and murkier.

406
00:19:23,797 --> 00:19:25,696
It was like watching
a Budweiser

407

couldn't take it.

they decided it had to stop.

and they take it away.

I get this inspiration.

428
00:20:16,736 --> 00:20:18,794
This great idea
comes to me,

429
00:20:18,796 --> 00:20:20,614
and I, like, wiggle up.

right up in the air.

432
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,615
My body's curled over

433

like I'm about
to suck my own dick,

434
00:20:29,658 --> 00:20:31,756
but I didn't.

435
00:20:31,758 --> 00:20:35,737

into my own mouth.

And I drank it.

Yeah, I drank it,
you know, like...

442

And the most incredible thing

443
00:20:49,601 --> 00:20:50,769
is that it wasn't
in the movie.

444
00:20:50,771 --> 00:20:51,799
I asked the director,
I was like,

445
00:20:51,801 --> 00:20:53,669
"Why wasn't it
in the movie?"

446
00:20:53,671 --> 00:20:55,650

"Because it was illegal."

If you don't have
to get sober, fuck it.

463
00:21:34,818 --> 00:21:36,806
But I really had to,
because, like,

464
00:21:36,808 --> 00:21:38,806
I've been sober
since Johnny Knoxville

465
00:21:38,808 --> 00:21:40,727
pulled an intervention on me.

466
00:21:40,729 --> 00:21:42,767
And you know you've got
a fucked-up problem

467
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:45,758
when your interventionist
is Johnny Knoxville.

It's called 5150.

473
00:21:54,681 --> 00:21:56,799
It says if you're harmful
to yourself,

474
00:21:56,801 --> 00:21:58,790
they can lock you up
in a psychiatric ward

475

476
00:22:00,732 --> 00:22:04,650

The intervention that
Knoxville pulled on me

483
00:22:19,735 --> 00:22:20,813
wasn't my first.

484
00:22:20,815 --> 00:22:22,803
It was, like,
my fourth or fifth,

485
00:22:22,805 --> 00:22:24,664
but the thing
about the first ones

486
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:26,694
is that I hallucinated
all of them.

00:22:30,827 --> 00:22:32,665

00:22:32,667 --> 00:22:33,785
I watched them walk in.

491

Some of them came
right through the wall.

And...

493
00:22:37,698 --> 00:22:40,626
Yeah, they sat me down
to have this serious talk,

494
00:22:40,628 --> 00:22:41,796

00:25:29,634 --> 00:25:31,773
There's never been a
dorkier-looking motherfucker

540
00:25:31,775 --> 00:25:34,633
on television, period, ever.

541
00:25:34,635 --> 00:25:37,754
And I always knew whether
he was at Subway or not,

542
00:25:37,756 --> 00:25:39,714
he was eating fresh.

543
00:25:39,716 --> 00:25:40,744
[laughs]

544
00:25:40,746 --> 00:25:44,625
[blubbering]

545
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:46,705
But then he shows up
on the news

546
00:25:46,707 --> 00:25:48,775
because it turns out
he likes it even fresher

547
00:25:48,777 --> 00:25:52,766
than I thought.

548
00:25:52,768 --> 00:25:54,756
So <i>Jackass</i> came out,

549
00:25:54,758 --> 00:25:57,849
and I was so ready
to mow down beav.

550
00:25:59,819 --> 00:26:01,667
One time, early days,

551
00:26:01,669 --> 00:26:03,628
I was fooling around
with this girl,

552
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:05,798
and as soon as
she pulled out my wiener,

553
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,638
she got all serious and
she looked at me and said,

554
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,739
"I was in a bad accident."

555
00:26:10,741 --> 00:26:13,809
And I'm thinking,
what the fuck?

556
00:26:13,811 --> 00:26:18,720
And then she says, "Get ready
to have a really good time."

557
00:26:18,722 --> 00:26:20,790
And then she pulled out
her teeth.

558
00:26:20,792 --> 00:26:21,850
[chuckles, audience reacts]

559
00:26:21,852 --> 00:26:23,721
Yeah, yeah.

560
00:26:23,723 --> 00:26:24,831
All of her upper front teeth

561
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,811
were attached
to this retainer thing,

562
00:26:26,813 --> 00:26:31,672
like this.

563
00:26:31,674 --> 00:26:35,753
But was all
of her upper front teeth.

564
00:26:35,755 --> 00:26:38,803
But don't feel bad for me.
[chuckles]

565
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:42,834
Because when those teeth
came out, it was awesome!

566
00:26:42,836 --> 00:26:44,814
I couldn't wait to tell
Knoxville and the guys.

567
00:26:44,816 --> 00:26:48,725
I was like, "Dudes, that girl
wasn't giving me a hummer.

568
00:26:48,727 --> 00:26:51,665
It was a gummer."
[chuckles]

569
00:26:51,667 --> 00:26:52,815
And they loved
the story so much,

570
00:26:52,817 --> 00:26:54,805
they tracked down
a shark with no teeth

571
00:26:54,807 --> 00:26:56,796
to bite me in the movie,
which is why there's a scene

572
00:26:56,798 --> 00:26:58,776
called
"The Whale Shark Gummer."

573
00:26:58,778 --> 00:27:01,809
Yeah, and I bet you thought
<i>Jackass</i> was shallow.

574
00:27:04,719 --> 00:27:06,817
So... the third <i>Jackass film,</i>

575
00:27:06,819 --> 00:27:08,818
I was clean and sober
the whole time,

576
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:11,728
but my sex addiction
was getting a little crazier.

577
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,848
We're promoting the movie
in Texas.

578
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:15,789
You know where?

579
00:27:15,791 --> 00:27:17,819
Fucking Austin.

580
00:27:17,821 --> 00:27:20,739
[cheers and applause]

581
00:27:20,741 --> 00:27:21,850
And I'm at this event.

582
00:27:21,852 --> 00:27:23,870
I get to talking
to a pretty cute girl.

583
00:27:23,872 --> 00:27:26,860
I tell her, "Man, I'm ready
to get the hell out of here.

584
00:27:26,862 --> 00:27:29,831
You think you could give me
a ride to my hotel?"

585
00:27:29,833 --> 00:27:32,661
And I can tell,
she's down.

586
00:27:32,663 --> 00:27:34,702
She's like, "Yeah."
We leave right away.

587
00:27:34,704 --> 00:27:35,822
We're getting into her car.

588
00:27:35,824 --> 00:27:38,692
Her two friends running
through the parking lot,

589
00:27:38,694 --> 00:27:40,845
"Steve-O, do you want
two more girls?"

590
00:27:43,825 --> 00:27:47,814
Hmm, well, I certainly
didn't want to be rude.

591
00:27:47,816 --> 00:27:50,714
So I get into the car
with three girls.

592
00:27:50,716 --> 00:27:53,675
I'm sitting in the backseat,

593
00:27:53,677 --> 00:27:54,835
panicking.

594
00:27:54,837 --> 00:27:56,875
The whole way to the hotel
I'm just thinking,

595
00:27:56,877 --> 00:27:58,725
"This is the worst
possible time

596
00:27:58,727 --> 00:28:01,656
to be a premature ejaculator."

597
00:28:01,658 --> 00:28:02,806
Because that's me, man.

598
00:28:02,808 --> 00:28:05,656
If a fucking tree falls
in the woods,

599
00:28:05,658 --> 00:28:07,687
you can pretty much bank
on me blowing a load

600
00:28:07,689 --> 00:28:08,877
before it lands.

601
00:28:08,879 --> 00:28:10,847
[chuckles]

602
00:28:10,849 --> 00:28:14,758
And I got a pretty good idea
what's about to go down,

603
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,878
but I can't imagine all
three girls getting a turn.

604
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,849
Any kind of a turn.

605
00:28:19,851 --> 00:28:22,799
I can't imagine all three of
them getting a glimpse

606
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:26,680
of my dick
without it exploding.

607
00:28:26,682 --> 00:28:28,880
So right away,
I start concentrating.

608
00:28:28,882 --> 00:28:31,833
"Grandma taking a shit."
[chuckles]

609
00:28:34,653 --> 00:28:35,801
I'm so stressed out.

610
00:28:35,803 --> 00:28:36,881
We get back to my hotel.

611
00:28:36,883 --> 00:28:38,852
I open up the door
to my room.

612
00:28:38,854 --> 00:28:40,772
We all walk in.

613
00:28:40,774 --> 00:28:42,862
I get on the bed
with the original girl,

614
00:28:42,864 --> 00:28:45,843
while the two extra girls are
just lurking in the doorway

615
00:28:45,845 --> 00:28:47,833
like bouncers.

616
00:28:47,835 --> 00:28:49,813
The less beautiful extra girl

617
00:28:49,815 --> 00:28:52,776
says to the more beautiful
extra girl...

618
00:28:55,736 --> 00:28:58,735
"So, like, are we here
to cock block

619
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:01,855
or are we stepping in?"

620
00:29:01,857 --> 00:29:03,825
Exact words.

621
00:29:03,827 --> 00:29:06,796
The more beautiful extra girl
points at the bed and says,

622
00:29:06,798 --> 00:29:09,816
"Get in there and
make yourself useful."

623
00:29:09,818 --> 00:29:11,717
[cheering]

624
00:29:11,719 --> 00:29:13,787
So I'm laying there.

625
00:29:13,789 --> 00:29:15,737
I feel these two hands

626
00:29:15,739 --> 00:29:17,698
lightly tickling their way

627
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,668
up my legs.

628
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:20,868
They're getting
closer and closer.

629
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:22,698
I'm thinking,
"Why are you doing that?

630
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,669
Fucking stop!"

631
00:29:24,671 --> 00:29:28,669
I'm starting to think
nobody's gonna get a turn.

632
00:29:28,671 --> 00:29:31,670
Like, the opportunity of
a lifetime is about to vanish

633
00:29:31,672 --> 00:29:35,740
with my boxers
glued to my left leg.

634
00:29:35,742 --> 00:29:37,753
And then
out comes my wiener.

635
00:29:40,833 --> 00:29:42,822
And the less beautiful
extra girl

636
00:29:42,824 --> 00:29:45,772
starts giving me
the toothiest blowjob

637
00:29:45,774 --> 00:29:48,882
you ever heard of.

638
00:29:48,884 --> 00:29:51,823
Aghh-aghh-aghh-aghh!

639
00:29:51,825 --> 00:29:53,793
It was like
a fucking crocodile

640
00:29:53,795 --> 00:29:56,674
was trying to suck my dick.

641
00:29:56,676 --> 00:29:59,714
I looked down, and she's
got it in a death roll.

642
00:29:59,716 --> 00:30:02,835
Gah!

643
00:30:02,837 --> 00:30:05,845
And I'm laying there
thinking, "Fuck yeah!

644
00:30:05,847 --> 00:30:08,856
She's keeping me
in the game!"

645
00:30:08,858 --> 00:30:10,696
[cheers and applause]

646
00:30:10,698 --> 00:30:14,846
It was like Shark Week
on my dick,

647
00:30:14,848 --> 00:30:16,887
and that was
what I needed.

648
00:30:16,889 --> 00:30:19,887
But then it wasn't
her turn anymore.

649
00:30:19,889 --> 00:30:22,698
So now the more beautiful
extra girl,

650
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,848
she starts sucking my wiener,

651
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:26,688
and she's doing
way too good of a job.

652
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:28,769
So I freaked out
and I shoved her off.

653
00:30:28,771 --> 00:30:31,729
"Aah!"

654
00:30:31,731 --> 00:30:32,889
As quick as I could,
I got my dick

655
00:30:32,891 --> 00:30:35,740
back into the jaws of hell.

656
00:30:35,742 --> 00:30:38,820
Gah-aah-aah-aah!

657
00:30:38,822 --> 00:30:41,711
I was so thankful

658
00:30:41,713 --> 00:30:42,871
for having
an ugly-ass girl

659
00:30:42,873 --> 00:30:45,891
chewing on my schlong.

660
00:30:45,893 --> 00:30:48,752
It was a miracle.
All three girls got a turn.

661
00:30:48,754 --> 00:30:50,852
So now the original girl,
she takes over,

662
00:30:50,854 --> 00:30:53,763
and, like, I can't
hold out anymore.

663
00:30:53,765 --> 00:30:54,903
So I just said it,

664
00:30:54,905 --> 00:30:56,843
"I'm gonna come!"

665
00:30:56,845 --> 00:30:59,723
But I didn't say it
like that.

666
00:30:59,725 --> 00:31:01,784
I said,

667
00:31:01,786 --> 00:31:04,906
"Aghh-aah-aah!"

668
00:31:06,787 --> 00:31:09,765
Because you gotta
say something.

669
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:12,906
If you don't say anything,
that is rude.

670
00:31:12,908 --> 00:31:16,766
I will tell you why it is
so important to alert a lady.

671
00:31:16,768 --> 00:31:19,857
Because one time I blew
a load into a girl's mouth

672
00:31:19,859 --> 00:31:21,887
with no warning at all.

673
00:31:21,889 --> 00:31:24,767
Not even a courtesy grunt.

674
00:31:24,769 --> 00:31:26,808
[laughs]

675
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:29,690
And she held it in her mouth.

676
00:31:32,691 --> 00:31:34,799
She came back up
and went to give me a kiss.

677
00:31:34,801 --> 00:31:36,679
[audience groans]

678
00:31:36,681 --> 00:31:40,800
And she fucking spit
that shit into <i>my</i> mouth!

679
00:31:40,802 --> 00:31:42,750
[cheers and applause]

680
00:31:42,752 --> 00:31:45,721
And I swallowed it!

681
00:31:45,723 --> 00:31:46,801
No, I did not.

682
00:31:46,803 --> 00:31:47,861
That was a lie.

683
00:31:47,863 --> 00:31:49,841
I did not swallow it.

684
00:31:49,843 --> 00:31:52,852
That was when I found out
I'm a spitter.

685
00:31:52,854 --> 00:31:55,882
[spitting]

686
00:31:55,884 --> 00:31:57,802
But it was in there
long enough

687
00:31:57,804 --> 00:32:00,893
for me to know
what it tastes like.

688
00:32:00,895 --> 00:32:03,853
It tastes like shame.

689
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:07,784
[laughs]

690
00:32:07,786 --> 00:32:09,724
That mouthful of my own come

691
00:32:09,726 --> 00:32:11,685
was the second worst thing
that ever happened to me

692
00:32:11,687 --> 00:32:12,885
during an intimate encounter,

693
00:32:12,887 --> 00:32:15,845
and I will tell you
the first.

694
00:32:15,847 --> 00:32:17,916
I brought a stripper home
from the titty bar.

695
00:32:17,918 --> 00:32:20,736
Came up with the genius idea
to eat her pussy.

696
00:32:20,738 --> 00:32:22,686
[audience groans]
[man] Yeah!

697
00:32:22,688 --> 00:32:23,887
I got down there
and I could tell

698
00:32:23,889 --> 00:32:26,737
she had been working
very hard that night.

699
00:32:26,739 --> 00:32:27,857
[audience groans, laughs]

700
00:32:27,859 --> 00:32:29,877
Maybe even squeezed in
an hour of hot yoga.

701
00:32:29,879 --> 00:32:31,858
[chuckles]

702
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:32,898
I felt like I was making out

703
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:35,758
with a pile
of sweaty nickels.

704
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,769
[audience groans, laughs]

705
00:32:37,771 --> 00:32:39,699
It was like
I was using my tongue

706
00:32:39,701 --> 00:32:41,819
to scrape mold out of
a broken refrigerator.

707
00:32:41,821 --> 00:32:43,920
[audience groans]

708
00:32:43,922 --> 00:32:45,840
But that's not
what made it so bad.

709
00:32:45,842 --> 00:32:49,921
There I was licking
her sweaty, stinky pussy,

710
00:32:49,923 --> 00:32:51,801
and she farted.
[chuckles]

711
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,711
[audience reacts]

712
00:32:53,713 --> 00:32:56,892
I swear, and that fart
did not sound like,

713
00:32:56,894 --> 00:32:58,872
"Poot."

714
00:32:58,874 --> 00:33:01,872
That fucking fart
sounded like,

715
00:33:01,874 --> 00:33:03,833
"Ssss."

716
00:33:03,835 --> 00:33:06,903
It was a fucking steamer.

717
00:33:06,905 --> 00:33:10,894
I could feel the heat.

718
00:33:10,896 --> 00:33:12,714
And as soon as it was over,

719
00:33:12,716 --> 00:33:14,834
I never looked her
in the eye ever again.

720
00:33:14,836 --> 00:33:17,717
Not any eye, you know?

721
00:33:19,887 --> 00:33:22,716
Buttholes.

722
00:33:22,718 --> 00:33:25,806
Real quick, let's talk
about ass fucking.

723
00:33:25,808 --> 00:33:26,926
[chuckles]

724
00:33:26,928 --> 00:33:29,697
I never understood
the philosophy

725
00:33:29,699 --> 00:33:31,847
of sticking your dick
up someone's ass,

726
00:33:31,849 --> 00:33:33,727
but one night...

727
00:33:33,729 --> 00:33:34,918
[laughs]

728
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,748
I was like, you know,
with a lady,

729
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:38,828
feeling adventurous.

730
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:40,798
I lubed up my finger
with some spit.

731
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,889
[chuckles]

732
00:33:41,891 --> 00:33:44,759
I worked it
into her butthole,

733
00:33:44,761 --> 00:33:45,889
and would you believe it,

734
00:33:45,891 --> 00:33:48,800
I found a terrorist
in the cave.

735
00:33:48,802 --> 00:33:51,810
Something was poking back.

736
00:33:51,812 --> 00:33:54,851
It was a piece of shit.

737
00:33:54,853 --> 00:33:55,931
Totally loaded chamber.

738
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:58,733
The train had not
left the station.

739
00:34:00,814 --> 00:34:02,892
Now I'm older,

740
00:34:02,894 --> 00:34:05,872
and at a certain point
it seems like

741
00:34:05,874 --> 00:34:08,703
running around trying
to scam on chicks

742
00:34:08,705 --> 00:34:10,823
becomes kinda pathetic,
you know?

743
00:34:10,825 --> 00:34:12,823
I decided if I'm gonna
be happy in my life,

744
00:34:12,825 --> 00:34:15,734
I need to learn how to be
in a healthy relationship.

745
00:34:15,736 --> 00:34:18,834
All right, how many of
you guys are in relationships?

746
00:34:18,836 --> 00:34:20,725
[cheers and applause]

747
00:34:20,727 --> 00:34:22,875
All right.

748
00:34:22,877 --> 00:34:24,905
- You guys got kids?
- No.

749
00:34:24,907 --> 00:34:26,866
Yeah, fuck that, right?

750
00:34:26,868 --> 00:34:28,896
[laughter and cheering]

751
00:34:28,898 --> 00:34:31,886
I've always been pretty sure
that having kids isn't for me.

752
00:34:31,888 --> 00:34:33,827
[chuckles]

753
00:34:33,829 --> 00:34:35,927
One time I was getting
super drunk

754
00:34:35,929 --> 00:34:39,848
with the incredibly
beautiful, amazing

755
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:41,738
Kat Von D.

756
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:44,728
[cheers and applause]

757
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:46,909
We were cracking up over
how dumb we think it is

758
00:34:46,911 --> 00:34:50,749
to throw your life away like
that, you know, by having kids.

759
00:34:50,751 --> 00:34:53,760
So I said, "Wouldn't it be
funny if I got a tattoo

760
00:34:53,762 --> 00:34:56,760
of a baby with a circle

761
00:34:56,762 --> 00:34:58,861
and a slash
going through it?"

762
00:34:58,863 --> 00:35:00,791
Like a "no babies" sign.

763
00:35:00,793 --> 00:35:02,911
We thought it was funny,
but we just kept drinking.

764
00:35:02,913 --> 00:35:04,881
We're on South Beach
doing shots.

765
00:35:04,883 --> 00:35:07,932
All of a sudden the idea
turns into a tattoo that says,

766
00:35:07,934 --> 00:35:09,932
"Fuck babies."

767
00:35:09,934 --> 00:35:11,883
[chuckles]

768
00:35:11,885 --> 00:35:13,883
And that is funny.

769
00:35:13,885 --> 00:35:15,833
But we just kept drinking,

770
00:35:15,835 --> 00:35:17,844
obviously way too much,

771
00:35:17,846 --> 00:35:20,894
because we wound up at
the Miami Ink tattoo parlor

772
00:35:20,896 --> 00:35:24,725
where I got a tattoo
of a guy fucking a baby.

773
00:35:24,727 --> 00:35:25,875
[audience groans]

774
00:35:25,877 --> 00:35:27,855
I know,
it was really upsetting,

775
00:35:27,857 --> 00:35:29,935
because those artists
were so skilled.

776
00:35:29,937 --> 00:35:31,746
[chuckles]

777
00:35:31,748 --> 00:35:32,826
There was no mistaking

778
00:35:32,828 --> 00:35:34,856
what was going on
in that picture.

779
00:35:34,858 --> 00:35:37,867
Down to the tears flying out
of the baby's eyes.

780
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:39,817
[audience groans]

781
00:35:39,819 --> 00:35:40,927
And as soon as I got done

782
00:35:40,929 --> 00:35:43,718
getting my
baby-fucking tattoo,

783
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,848
I stepped outside.

784
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:46,718
The first people
coming down the sidewalk,

785
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,868
all excited to see me.

786
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:51,739
I said,
"Check out my new tattoo."

787
00:35:51,741 --> 00:35:52,949
And even as drunk
as I was,

788
00:35:52,951 --> 00:35:56,860
the look of fucking horror
on their faces

789
00:35:56,862 --> 00:35:58,930
told me I made
a big mistake.

790
00:35:58,932 --> 00:36:00,890
I couldn't live with it.

791
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:03,781
It wasn't long before
I showed up at another parlor,

792
00:36:03,783 --> 00:36:05,781
and I said,
"Give me that thing."

793
00:36:05,783 --> 00:36:07,751
I took the tattoo gun myself

794
00:36:07,753 --> 00:36:08,941
and I drilled over that baby

795
00:36:08,943 --> 00:36:12,912
until I turned it into
a mysterious black blob.

796
00:36:12,914 --> 00:36:15,802
And then I showed it to my
<i>Jackass</i> buddy Bam.

797
00:36:15,804 --> 00:36:17,853
He took one look at it,
he said,

798
00:36:17,855 --> 00:36:20,843
"You should turn that blob
into an ostrich."

799
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,956
[chuckles]

800
00:36:26,916 --> 00:36:28,897
[laughter and applause]

801
00:36:35,838 --> 00:36:37,816
When your cover-up tattoo

802
00:36:37,818 --> 00:36:41,767
is a guy fucking an ostrich,

803
00:36:41,769 --> 00:36:42,867
that's when you know
you started off

804
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:45,739
with something
pretty rotten, you know?

805
00:36:47,769 --> 00:36:49,858
But I don't even have
to think about having kids

806
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,848
if I can't be
in a healthy relationship.

807
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:53,928
So one day I decided, man,
you know what?

808
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:56,749
It's time to get to work
on becoming the man

809
00:36:56,751 --> 00:36:59,769
that the love
of my life deserves,

810
00:36:59,771 --> 00:37:01,770
and I started
by promising myself

811
00:37:01,772 --> 00:37:03,750
when I'm on the road
from here on out,

812
00:37:03,752 --> 00:37:05,860
no more fooling around
with random chicks.

813
00:37:05,862 --> 00:37:07,811
[scattered laughter]

814
00:37:07,813 --> 00:37:08,871
[woman]
Aww.

815
00:37:08,873 --> 00:37:09,901
[laughter]

816
00:37:09,903 --> 00:37:11,771
[man]
Yeah!

817
00:37:11,773 --> 00:37:15,752
But everywhere I went,
something popped up.

818
00:37:15,754 --> 00:37:17,822
And it got really hard,
you know,

819
00:37:17,824 --> 00:37:19,842
to, like, turn down
opportunities.

820
00:37:19,844 --> 00:37:22,733
Like the first trip
I went on, Toronto,

821
00:37:22,735 --> 00:37:24,963
and there I was
just minding my own business

822
00:37:24,965 --> 00:37:26,774
in the titty bar...

823
00:37:26,776 --> 00:37:28,834
[chuckles]

824
00:37:28,836 --> 00:37:30,844
And this beautiful little
19-year-old stripper

825
00:37:30,846 --> 00:37:33,945
with huge real boobs just
comes beelining it for me,

826
00:37:33,947 --> 00:37:37,805
and she sticks her perfect
little tushy right in my face.

827
00:37:37,807 --> 00:37:39,956
And when I look at it
I can see she's got

828
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:43,866
my autograph tattooed
on her butt cheek.

829
00:37:43,868 --> 00:37:45,786
[man]
Yeah!

830
00:37:45,788 --> 00:37:47,877
And it's not easy
to turn down a piece of ass

831
00:37:47,879 --> 00:37:50,759
with your name on it.

832
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:55,758
Everywhere I went, I broke
my promise it seemed like,

833
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,798
until it got to a point
where I was like,

834
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,759
"I have a problem," and I
started seeing a sex therapist.

835
00:38:00,761 --> 00:38:01,949
I asked him to help me
change my ways,

836
00:38:01,951 --> 00:38:04,869
and he says, "Okay, on your
next trip to Mississippi

837
00:38:04,871 --> 00:38:06,820
with the big show
in the casino,

838
00:38:06,822 --> 00:38:09,830
as soon as it's over,
go back to your hotel room

839
00:38:09,832 --> 00:38:12,891
by yourself and call me up
to check in."

840
00:38:12,893 --> 00:38:14,801
So that's what I did.

841
00:38:14,803 --> 00:38:15,921
I did the show,
back to my room,

842
00:38:15,923 --> 00:38:17,881
and I called him up,
and I said,

843
00:38:17,883 --> 00:38:21,852
"Hey, man, thank you so much
for being there for me."

844
00:38:21,854 --> 00:38:24,923
And then I hung up the phone
and left.

845
00:38:24,925 --> 00:38:26,883
[laughs]

846
00:38:26,885 --> 00:38:28,803
You know when
you're on a diet,

847
00:38:28,805 --> 00:38:30,743
all you can think about
is food?

848
00:38:30,745 --> 00:38:32,914
It was like I turned into
a werewolf on the prowl

849
00:38:32,916 --> 00:38:35,764
for a fur burger.

850
00:38:35,766 --> 00:38:37,845
I went back down
to the casino,

851
00:38:37,847 --> 00:38:40,905
I was, "Aghh-aah-aah!"

852
00:38:40,907 --> 00:38:42,795
Stalking prey.

853
00:38:42,797 --> 00:38:45,756
But all I saw was just
disgusting-looking people

854
00:38:45,758 --> 00:38:47,756
smoking cigarettes
on slot machines.

855
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:48,856
"Aah, aah, gah-gah!"

856
00:38:48,858 --> 00:38:50,967
And I'm like,
"This isn't gonna work."

857
00:38:50,969 --> 00:38:52,957
So I went back up
to my hotel room

858
00:38:52,959 --> 00:38:54,967
and I got on Twitter.

859
00:38:54,969 --> 00:38:57,778
I'm thinking there's got
to be a female in the area

860
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,768
who just sent me a message

861
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:01,798
saying that she wants
to hook up right now,

862
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,869
and there was totally
a message like that.

863
00:39:04,871 --> 00:39:08,979
But it came from somebody
who had no profile picture.

864
00:39:08,981 --> 00:39:12,830
Just a fucking egg.

865
00:39:12,832 --> 00:39:15,900
And you know
you might be a sex addict

866
00:39:15,902 --> 00:39:19,771
when you invite that fucking
person to your hotel room,

867
00:39:19,773 --> 00:39:20,841
which is what I did.

868
00:39:20,843 --> 00:39:22,982
I sent a private message
with my room number.

869
00:39:22,984 --> 00:39:24,942
It said, "Come on over."

870
00:39:24,944 --> 00:39:26,862
[laughs]

871
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:28,862
As soon as I hit send,
I was like,

872
00:39:28,864 --> 00:39:32,823
"What the fuck
did I just do?

873
00:39:32,825 --> 00:39:36,864
What did I just order
to my room?"

874
00:39:36,866 --> 00:39:39,776
Sure enough,
a little while later...

875
00:39:46,917 --> 00:39:49,766
I'm hiding behind the bed,
holding my breath,

876
00:39:49,768 --> 00:39:51,776
thinking if I just
pretend I'm not here,

877
00:39:51,778 --> 00:39:54,856
that person will leave.

878
00:39:54,858 --> 00:39:58,957
But I was way too curious
to do that.

879
00:39:58,959 --> 00:40:00,859
So I tiptoe over.

880
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,758
When I look through
the peephole I'm like,

881
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,861
"No way!
She's not that bad!"

882
00:40:11,841 --> 00:40:13,919
I mean, she wasn't
exactly good.

883
00:40:13,921 --> 00:40:15,760
[chuckles]

884
00:40:15,762 --> 00:40:16,840
But at this point,
I don't care.

885
00:40:16,842 --> 00:40:17,880
I open up the door,
I was like,

886
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:19,780
"Come on in.
This is great.

887
00:40:19,782 --> 00:40:23,761
Maybe we'll watch
a movie."

888
00:40:23,763 --> 00:40:26,831
So we get on the bed and
I ask her, "What do you do?"

889
00:40:26,833 --> 00:40:29,972
She says,
"I'm a webcam whore."

890
00:40:29,974 --> 00:40:32,772
Part of me's thinking,
"This is terrible.

891
00:40:32,774 --> 00:40:33,903
What am I doing?"

892
00:40:33,905 --> 00:40:35,843
And the other part
of me's thinking,

893
00:40:35,845 --> 00:40:39,933
"Webcam whore.
Cool.

894
00:40:39,935 --> 00:40:42,894
This'll be a slam dunk."

895
00:40:42,896 --> 00:40:44,874
So I get confident

896
00:40:44,876 --> 00:40:47,785
and right away
I start stroking her hair,

897
00:40:47,787 --> 00:40:51,775
but she wants to keep talking
about being a webcam whore.

898
00:40:51,777 --> 00:40:53,996
And it gets really creepy
when she says,

899
00:40:53,998 --> 00:40:56,896
"Guys can be pretty mean,

900
00:40:56,898 --> 00:40:58,816
'cause when
I take off my top,

901
00:40:58,818 --> 00:41:00,937
I have horrible scars
all over my boobs

902
00:41:00,939 --> 00:41:03,917
from a botched boob job."

903
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:05,777
Part of me's thinking,

904
00:41:05,779 --> 00:41:07,948
"All bad!
Abort mission!"

905
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:10,798
But the other part
of me's thinking,

906
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,869
"I am a premature ejaculator,

907
00:41:12,871 --> 00:41:15,889
and those scars
could help a lot.

908
00:41:15,891 --> 00:41:19,990
So let's just see how fucked up
these tits really are.

909
00:41:19,992 --> 00:41:23,850
Maybe I'll last longer."

910
00:41:23,852 --> 00:41:25,951
And that's what happened.
[chuckles]

911
00:41:25,953 --> 00:41:28,911
But it was incomprehensibly
demoralizing.

912
00:41:28,913 --> 00:41:30,911
Here I was doing exactly
what I promised myself

913
00:41:30,913 --> 00:41:32,822
over and over and over
that I wouldn't do,

914
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:34,872
and now I'm doing it
with Frankentits.

915
00:41:34,874 --> 00:41:36,822
[laughs]

916
00:41:36,824 --> 00:41:38,002
Like, how low can I go?

917
00:41:38,004 --> 00:41:40,913
So I go back home
to my sex therapist,

918
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:42,923
tell him what happened,
and he says,

919
00:41:42,925 --> 00:41:46,824
"Man, it's really clear, you
need to become sexually sober,

920
00:41:46,826 --> 00:41:48,834
and it's important
that you start

921
00:41:48,836 --> 00:41:51,875
with a period of abstinence,
total celibacy,

922
00:41:51,877 --> 00:41:53,945
which means you don't
even jack off."

923
00:41:53,947 --> 00:41:57,796
Yeah, shit just got real.
[chuckles]

924
00:41:57,798 --> 00:41:58,886
Like, you don't even
jack off?

925
00:41:58,888 --> 00:42:00,776
I love jacking off!

926
00:42:00,778 --> 00:42:03,786
I got a crooked-ass dick
to prove it.

927
00:42:03,788 --> 00:42:06,007
Right?

928
00:42:06,009 --> 00:42:08,897
I think it's natural for guys
to have crooked dicks,

929
00:42:08,899 --> 00:42:12,878
but women don't necessarily
understand why.

930
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,959
A lot of guys are thinking,
"Shut the fuck up, Steve-O!

931
00:42:16,961 --> 00:42:19,929
Fucking drop that shit."

932
00:42:19,931 --> 00:42:21,889
But I'm gonna tell you,
ladies,

933
00:42:21,891 --> 00:42:23,900
because I'm right-handed,

934
00:42:23,902 --> 00:42:26,860
my dick always looks
like it's impatiently waiting

935
00:42:26,862 --> 00:42:29,861
for a bus that's coming
from that direction.

936
00:42:29,863 --> 00:42:31,963
[laughter and applause]

937
00:42:39,784 --> 00:42:42,863
It's on that angle
right there.

938
00:42:42,865 --> 00:42:44,853
It's because I love
jacking off,

939
00:42:44,855 --> 00:42:46,893
and I got this guy
telling me I gotta stop.

940
00:42:46,895 --> 00:42:49,984
He says, "Let's just try
30 days, no masturbating."

941
00:42:49,986 --> 00:42:52,926
And I'm like, "Man, I want
to have a good life."

942
00:42:55,827 --> 00:42:58,865
So I gave it hell.

943
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:00,905
When I got to three days,

944
00:43:00,907 --> 00:43:03,786
if you think quitting
cigarettes or drugs

945
00:43:03,788 --> 00:43:06,926
makes people grumpy...
[laughs]

946
00:43:06,928 --> 00:43:08,957
When I got to seven days,
I could not be trusted

947
00:43:08,959 --> 00:43:12,977
with a laptop computer
for any reason at all.

948
00:43:12,979 --> 00:43:16,838
Then there I was
on day 11,

949
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:21,008
alone in the bathtub.

950
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:24,789
Just washing up.

951
00:43:24,791 --> 00:43:28,960
And the line between
hygiene and romance

952
00:43:28,962 --> 00:43:33,850
got a little bit blurry.

953
00:43:33,852 --> 00:43:36,021
Turned out I accidentally
seduced myself.

954
00:43:36,023 --> 00:43:38,021
[moaning]

955
00:43:38,023 --> 00:43:40,882
And when I blew
that 11-day load, aah,

956
00:43:40,884 --> 00:43:43,922
I felt like I was having
a fucking heart attack, man!

957
00:43:43,924 --> 00:43:45,002
Fucking water's
flying everywhere.

958
00:43:45,004 --> 00:43:47,993
I glued my own eyes shut.

959
00:43:47,995 --> 00:43:49,883
Aah!

960
00:43:49,885 --> 00:43:51,013
And it was amazing, man.

961
00:43:51,015 --> 00:43:53,934
Eleven days, wow.

962
00:43:53,936 --> 00:43:55,844
But I was devastated.

963
00:43:55,846 --> 00:43:57,804
I broke my promise again!

964
00:43:57,806 --> 00:43:59,915
And now I'm in despair.
I think there's no hope for me.

965
00:43:59,917 --> 00:44:01,935
I got ambitious, man.

966
00:44:01,937 --> 00:44:04,965
I said, "You know what,
I'm gonna go for a whole year.

967
00:44:04,967 --> 00:44:07,856
No fooling around,
no jacking off.

968
00:44:07,858 --> 00:44:10,936
No nuttin'.

969
00:44:10,938 --> 00:44:12,997
Not one nut
for a whole year."

970
00:44:12,999 --> 00:44:16,007
And when Johnny Knoxville found
out about this little plan,

971
00:44:16,009 --> 00:44:18,837
he was concerned to the point
of fucking furious.

972
00:44:18,839 --> 00:44:22,018
He says, "You trying
to get prostate cancer?"

973
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:23,998
And I was like,
"Dude, Knoxville, man,

974
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,029
I'm putting sure
if jacking off

975
00:44:26,031 --> 00:44:28,899
was the cure
for prostate cancer,

976
00:44:28,901 --> 00:44:30,909
like, nobody would have it."

977
00:44:30,911 --> 00:44:32,920
[chuckles]

978
00:44:32,922 --> 00:44:35,930
We would've never heard of it.

979
00:44:35,932 --> 00:44:38,861
I wasn't worried
about prostate cancer,

980
00:44:38,863 --> 00:44:39,941
but you're probably thinking,

981
00:44:39,943 --> 00:44:41,901
"But why would you go
for a whole year

982
00:44:41,903 --> 00:44:42,891
without blowing a load?"

983
00:44:42,893 --> 00:44:44,811
And it was so simple to me.

984
00:44:44,813 --> 00:44:45,992
I was like, "Because
when it's time for me

985
00:44:45,994 --> 00:44:47,972
to be with that
special woman,

986
00:44:47,974 --> 00:44:51,843
she deserves to know
that I could go that long."

987
00:44:51,845 --> 00:44:53,813
And I'm thinking,
"When it's time for me

988
00:44:53,815 --> 00:44:54,983
to be with that woman,

989
00:44:54,985 --> 00:44:59,834
she better wear
a fucking poncho, man!"

990
00:44:59,836 --> 00:45:04,014
It'll look like a fucking
Nickelodeon awards show, man!

991
00:45:04,016 --> 00:45:05,945
Like, "Aah, aah, aah!"

992
00:45:05,947 --> 00:45:09,915
Either that or a humungous
marshmallow will fall out.

993
00:45:09,917 --> 00:45:11,806
But one way or another,

994
00:45:11,808 --> 00:45:14,808
we are talking
<i>Ghostbusters,</i> man.

995
00:45:15,968 --> 00:45:17,957
But how am I
gonna stay on the path

women coming to see me?

997

I could.

Scott and I have been
traveling together

1006
00:45:36,882 --> 00:45:38,980
for, like, two years now,
which begs the question:

1007
00:45:38,982 --> 00:45:41,870
Did you pull it or
did you didn't pull it?

1009
00:45:43,853 --> 00:45:46,971
I pulled it off.
I mean, I didn't, you know?

1010

I went a whole year,
you know.

In hindsight
all I really accomplished

1012
00:45:51,844 --> 00:45:55,002
was I was exceptionally
grumpy and mean for a year.
