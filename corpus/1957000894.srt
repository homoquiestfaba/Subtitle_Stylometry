00:01:03,915 --> 00:01:05,415
Yes, yes.

5
00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:06,451
Hey, Chief.

6
00:01:07,585 --> 00:01:08,887
I'm not sure this is the right
time.

7
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:11,556
Fuck that. They know me, Sport.

8
00:01:11,589 --> 00:01:13,892
Any chance your nine-inch claim
is a bit of an overstatement.

9
00:01:13,925 --> 00:01:15,025
What?

10
00:01:15,058 --> 00:01:17,462
Are you some authority
on my cock now?

11
00:01:18,028 --> 00:01:20,230
I've seen that. I'm not sure
that makes me an authority.

12
00:01:20,264 --> 00:01:22,000
When? After our workout.

13
00:01:22,032 --> 00:01:23,601
Yes.

14
00:01:23,635 --> 00:01:25,035
Well, it's not nine inches after
I peel off my bone handles.

15
00:01:25,068 --> 00:01:26,103
Even still.

16
00:01:26,136 --> 00:01:27,539
Even still what, shit bird?

17
00:01:27,572 --> 00:01:29,072
The physics just don't equate.

18
00:01:29,106 --> 00:01:31,041
[chuckles]

19
00:01:31,074 --> 00:01:33,011
You think a woman of Jade's caliber
was going to settle for six inches?

20
00:01:33,043 --> 00:01:35,947
Look, all I'm saying
is you are not nine.

21
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:36,915
[exhales]

22
00:01:36,948 --> 00:01:37,982
Fine, eight.

23
00:01:39,149 --> 00:01:40,417
If you think I'm
dropping down to seven,

24
00:01:40,451 --> 00:01:42,085
you need to go see
a motherfucking optometrist.

25

[crowd cheers]

26
00:01:43,655 --> 00:01:46,323
The [?] is dropping in 30 seconds, people.
Who wants him?

27
00:01:46,624 --> 00:01:48,058
Fuck, yes.

28
00:01:48,091 --> 00:01:49,594
You know what time it is.

I finally get to kill
myself a commie.

I love you too. Get him.

Tyron, USA versus Russia.

43
00:02:46,551 --> 00:02:47,986
We've broken this fight down.

44
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:50,455
Stylistic,
literally down to a molecule.

45
00:02:50,488 --> 00:02:52,857
These guys cannot stand each
other.

46
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:55,192
It's going to make
for a spectacular match up.

47
00:02:55,225 --> 00:02:56,628
It could be an instant classic.

All right, gentlemen, bring it in.
Bring it in, guys. Let's go.

72
00:04:35,793 --> 00:04:37,729
Gentlemen, you've both received
your shots in the locker room.

73
00:04:37,762 --> 00:04:40,198
You all know the rules.
If you want to touch gloves, do so now.

74
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,567
You can't just commie fuck
with nerve of agents fight?

75
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,801
It's 1:00 AM on the east coast.

76
00:04:43,835 --> 00:04:45,268
Cash, do you want
to get this thing started?

77
00:04:45,302 --> 00:04:48,106
This election-meddling
son of a bitch won't take long.

78
00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:49,239

Get back to your corners.
All right, let's go. Let's do this now.

00:04:56,981 --> 00:04:59,650
Blue corner, are you ready?
Red corner, are you ready?

82
00:04:59,684 --> 00:05:00,585
Fuck, yes.

Yes, yes.

87
00:05:42,359 --> 00:05:47,865
That's it, fight's over.

88
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,971
Roses are red, violets are
blue.

89
00:05:55,239 --> 00:05:59,644
I'm feeling pretty tits right now
but sure could really use a blow job.

90
00:06:00,645 --> 00:06:01,679
That almost rhymed.

91
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,215
Eat your heart out,
Emily Dickinson.

00:06:04,248 --> 00:06:05,616
Yes sir, baby.

93
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,151
Cash, you are not posting that.

94
00:06:07,552 --> 00:06:08,553
Never baby.

95
00:06:13,323 --> 00:06:17,360
Oh, yum, yum, yum, yum,
drink looks tasty too.

96
00:06:17,394 --> 00:06:19,362
[laughs]

97
00:06:19,396 --> 00:06:20,865
If that's all right, sweetheart.
Please do not encourage that, Jeez.

98
00:06:20,898 --> 00:06:22,300
Its called humor, darling.

99
00:06:22,332 --> 00:06:23,400
Not where I come from.

100
00:06:23,433 --> 00:06:25,069
Oh, burn.

101
00:06:25,102 --> 00:06:26,304

102
00:06:26,336 --> 00:06:28,005
Isn't my son a face God, Dazz.

103
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:29,173
Here we go.

104
00:06:29,207 --> 00:06:30,340
I mean it's hard
to believe with that

105
00:06:30,373 --> 00:06:33,044
faggoty hair and those
pretty-boy looks.

106
00:06:33,376 --> 00:06:36,214
Chief here slipped one
past the goalie back in college.

107
00:06:36,247 --> 00:06:39,116
Sport was the youngest
ever to make the US judo team.

108
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:42,186
Can you please shut the hell
up and just drink your drink.

109
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,421
Deserey, we'll let you know
if we need anything else.

110
00:06:44,455 --> 00:06:46,090
No problem. Just let me know.

111
00:06:46,123 --> 00:06:47,124
Thank you.

112
00:06:52,029 --> 00:06:53,297
Are you fucking blind.

113
00:06:53,865 --> 00:06:56,234
She's tighter than
a seven-year-old Korean boy.

114
00:06:56,267 --> 00:06:58,002
Enough with the damn Olympic
card.

115
00:06:58,035 --> 00:07:01,038
Since when did throwing
out a resume for a tasty

116
00:07:01,072 --> 00:07:03,474
piece of hair pie
become a goddamn crime.

117
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:06,611
Have a beer with me,
jack her back to the mansion.

118
00:07:06,944 --> 00:07:08,411
No mansion jacking.

119
00:07:08,813 --> 00:07:10,481
I've got a calculus test
tomorrow.

120
00:07:10,882 --> 00:07:12,216
Fuck arithmetic.

121
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,618
Well, you need to know
mom's going to breathalyze

122
00:07:13,651 --> 00:07:15,219
my ass right when I get home
too.

123
00:07:16,254 --> 00:07:17,855
Goddamn whack job she is.

124
00:07:17,889 --> 00:07:20,491
Hey, dillweed she might be
your ex but she's my mom.

125
00:07:21,292 --> 00:07:22,392
Way to go, Jetty.

126
00:07:22,894 --> 00:07:24,095
Apologies, Sport.

127
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,765
How is Miss Looney
Tunes doing anyway?

128
00:07:28,332 --> 00:07:30,635
She's still on match.com.

129
00:07:33,337 --> 00:07:35,573
No, threw in the towel last
month.

130
00:07:36,474 --> 00:07:38,910
What about Tard? How's he?

131
00:07:39,911 --> 00:07:42,980
Come on, can you please not
call him that for me, please.

132
00:07:43,514 --> 00:07:44,582
Fine, pussy hole.

133
00:07:49,687 --> 00:07:51,389
Don't you ever stop?

134
00:07:51,421 --> 00:07:55,660
Yes.
About 10 seconds before I puke.

135
00:07:57,194 --> 00:07:59,864
How is Timofey 'The Terrible'
feeling right about now.

136
00:08:00,865 --> 00:08:02,266
About $3 million richer.

137
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,801
You?

138
00:08:05,202 --> 00:08:07,305
I made a million bucks
per second last night, Sport.

139
00:08:08,472 --> 00:08:10,942
Crap. This is me right
here on the left.

140
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:16,347
Love you, Jade.

141
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,515
You too, Jetty.

142
00:08:18,382 --> 00:08:20,351
You got Kareef tomorrow at 3:00
PM.

143
00:08:20,384 --> 00:08:23,354
I'll be there.
Thanks for including me.

144
00:08:23,387 --> 00:08:25,890
Always, Sport, it's fun.

145
00:08:28,326 --> 00:08:29,193
Fucker.

146
00:08:29,226 --> 00:08:30,127
Hey.

147
00:08:30,161 --> 00:08:31,195
Too slow pussy hole.

148
00:08:31,529 --> 00:08:32,530
This is mine, fucker.

149
00:08:38,402 --> 00:08:45,376
[music]

150
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:34,585
I'm going to need you to help
me out this afternoon, Jett.

151
00:10:34,618 --> 00:10:36,253
Well I've got Kareef at 3:00
PM, Mom.

152
00:10:36,287 --> 00:10:38,490
Just take his Xbox with you and
stick him in Patty's office.

153
00:10:38,523 --> 00:10:39,623
Patty is busy, Mom.

154
00:10:39,957 --> 00:10:41,892
No she's not, trust me.

155
00:10:41,926 --> 00:10:44,463
I don't want to go to the gym.
He called me a tard.

156
00:10:44,496 --> 00:10:45,996
I talked to him, that's done,
okay?

157
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,331
I want to play with Patrick.

158
00:10:47,364 --> 00:10:48,332
No chance, baby.

159
00:10:48,365 --> 00:10:49,266
But I want to.

160
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,668
Today's no good, Q.

161
00:10:50,701 --> 00:10:52,471
Can you get him his meds
and finish up everything?

162
00:10:52,504 --> 00:10:54,105
I got a client at 7:45.

163
00:10:54,138 --> 00:10:55,574
Yes, go.

164
00:10:55,606 --> 00:10:56,674
Just don't forget your lunches,
okay? I love you guys.

165
00:10:56,707 --> 00:11:00,678
Yes, I love you too. Here you
go.

166
00:11:10,489 --> 00:11:11,490
Swallow.

167
00:11:15,693 --> 00:11:19,697
Open. Good man.
Hey, when you're finished?

168
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:22,534
Plate in the sink, brush your
teeth, and get dressed, okay?

169
00:11:22,567 --> 00:11:23,568
Okay.

170
00:11:26,538 --> 00:11:29,173
Hey, Jett. Hey Jett.

171
00:11:29,206 --> 00:11:30,341
Yes?

172
00:11:30,374 --> 00:11:31,976
Will there always
be toys in the world?

173
00:11:32,643 --> 00:11:34,044
Look I've got a huge test.

174
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:35,880
Just tell me yes or no
and I'll promise I'll stop.

175
00:11:35,913 --> 00:11:37,549
Yes, there will always be toys.

176
00:11:40,384 --> 00:11:41,385
Forever?

177
00:11:44,556 --> 00:11:46,558
Yes.

178
00:11:47,324 --> 00:11:49,494

00:11:49,528 --> 00:11:50,995
Ace, what's up, bro?

180
00:11:51,028 --> 00:11:54,165
All good man. You good?
Catch you, boys, later.

181
00:11:54,198 --> 00:11:54,965
Alright.

182
00:11:54,999 --> 00:11:56,367
Yo Q.

183
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,067
Hey, how you doing, man?

184
00:11:57,101 --> 00:11:58,402
Looking handsome, dog.

185
00:11:58,435 --> 00:11:59,336
Thanks, bro.

186
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:00,070
Feel good, boss.

187
00:12:00,104 --> 00:12:02,406
My man.

188
00:12:03,007 --> 00:12:05,976
Hey, your dad is filthy, man,
that's the only way to describe it.

189
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,978
Dude, where you there when he
made it rain at Olympic Gardens?

190
00:12:08,012 --> 00:12:08,913
How did you guys see that?

191
00:12:08,946 --> 00:12:10,582
Excuse me, I have a question,

192
00:12:10,615 --> 00:12:13,450
do you guys ever stick out
your tongues at each other?

193
00:12:15,453 --> 00:12:16,588
Quinn.

194
00:12:21,593 --> 00:12:28,232
Quinn, did you know Fat Lexy
have big, giant lovely boobies?

195
00:12:28,633 --> 00:12:30,834
[laughter]

196
00:12:30,868 --> 00:12:32,770
Patrick, come on now.

197
00:12:32,803 --> 00:12:34,238
It's funny, Mr. Stewart.

198
00:12:34,271 --> 00:12:35,439
No, it's not funny.

199
00:12:35,473 --> 00:12:37,074
Your dad is the shit.

200
00:12:37,107 --> 00:12:39,743
Okay Jerry. Come on man, what's
up? You want detention?

201
00:12:40,612 --> 00:12:41,779
No sir.

202
00:12:41,812 --> 00:12:43,582
No, that language
doesn't fly in my class.

203
00:12:44,281 --> 00:12:47,418
Make it quick, Jett.
Tongue fixation.

204
00:12:47,718 --> 00:12:49,420
No it's not tongue fixation.

205
00:12:49,454 --> 00:12:51,623
Jet what the heck is wrong with
you.

206
00:12:51,656 --> 00:12:54,425
Okay, everybody,
calm down, all right.

207
00:12:54,459 --> 00:12:55,726
Thanks for the heads up.

208
00:13:18,683 --> 00:13:25,657
[background noise]

209
00:14:04,529 --> 00:14:05,664
Thanks, Jett.

210
00:14:06,297 --> 00:14:13,237
[background noise]

211
00:14:17,174 --> 00:14:18,510
Improper integrals, huh?

212
00:14:18,876 --> 00:14:20,478
Can you get lower than an F?

213
00:14:20,911 --> 00:14:22,813
Seriously when she hands
back our tests mine's

214
00:14:22,846 --> 00:14:25,349
going to have a big red
G written across the top.

215
00:14:25,717 --> 00:14:26,718
No.

216
00:14:28,753 --> 00:14:30,522
Hope this fighting thing works
out.

217
00:14:35,092 --> 00:14:39,863
Nice baby, nice. You hit that
hammer. Again. Good, good.

218
00:14:40,732 --> 00:14:46,370
Now, don't get lazy, come on.
Move together. QUick and fast. Let's go.

219
00:14:46,403 --> 00:14:51,375
There you go. Move, move, move.
Go.

220
00:14:51,408 --> 00:14:53,277
Vaughn's Fight Academy,
this is Patty.

221
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:56,781
Paid for this suit too.

222
00:14:58,849 --> 00:14:59,850
Jamie's on two.

223
00:15:00,918 --> 00:15:02,386
How's Quinn holding up in
there?

224
00:15:02,419 --> 00:15:06,190
Other than asking me if he can
watch Pornhub, splendidly.

225
00:15:07,024 --> 00:15:09,193
Jesus. All right.

226
00:15:11,596 --> 00:15:14,766
Jamie, you shaved that
hideous fucking beard off yet.

227
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:15,800
Fuck you, Cash.

228
00:15:17,769 --> 00:15:20,772
I'm sitting here with my attorney
Mr. Adelsberg, aka the Jew assassin.

229
00:15:21,606 --> 00:15:23,775
He's just informed me
that you and Rami once

230
00:15:23,808 --> 00:15:26,043
again are giving
it to me up the dirt shoe.

231
00:15:26,578 --> 00:15:28,345
Shocking.

232
00:15:28,379 --> 00:15:32,249
The gate, merchandise, pay per
view, foreign PPV all the way down.

233
00:15:32,817 --> 00:15:34,952
Your numbers in Russia
alone aren't even close.

234
00:15:37,988 --> 00:15:39,791
Yes, all right.

235
00:15:39,824 --> 00:15:42,827
I'll get into it with Rami and
I'll get back to you fellows. Okay?

236
00:15:44,962 --> 00:15:46,296
What does that even mean?

237
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:47,665
They're worse than Putin.

238
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:51,569
Yes, but they can be defeated.

239
00:15:53,904 --> 00:15:57,842
Three, two, one. Good, twist.

240
00:15:58,843 --> 00:16:05,015
[noise]

241
00:16:08,152 --> 00:16:09,953
Is this Colbie fucking Caillat.

242
00:16:10,855 --> 00:16:12,122
Caillat.

243
00:16:12,156 --> 00:16:14,793
Holy fuck,
my son's a turd burglar, fellas.

244
00:16:15,926 --> 00:16:17,896
How do you expect to issue
a beat down when you're

245
00:16:17,928 --> 00:16:20,964
listening to all that West
Hollywood Meryl Streep bullshit.

246
00:16:20,998 --> 00:16:21,766
Colbie's hot Chief.

247
00:16:23,701 --> 00:16:28,673
Her, Taylor, and Selena, and they do
more for charity than you ever will.

248
00:16:28,706 --> 00:16:32,009
I give millions to charity,
dickface, it's called taxes.

249
00:16:33,043 --> 00:16:38,315
We got to hook you up.
System of a Down, Death Tone, Rob Zombie.

250
00:16:39,884 --> 00:16:41,853
I love my girls, deal with it.

251
00:16:43,488 --> 00:16:45,989
If you say so, Sport?
Are you ready to deal with me?

252
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:49,993
No, not a chance.
I can't even lift my arms.

253
00:16:50,027 --> 00:16:53,063
Hey, I'm wearing skinny jeans,
buddy. We're even.

254
00:16:53,531 --> 00:16:54,632
Get the fuck up here.

255
00:17:06,143 --> 00:17:08,847
You don't need that pussy headgear.
Come on.

256
00:17:13,551 --> 00:17:19,223
Come on, pussy. Judo fag mama's
boy.

257
00:17:22,494 --> 00:17:29,099
[music]

258
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:35,640
Oh, shit. We've got a bleeder
here.

259
00:17:35,673 --> 00:17:36,908
Cash.

260
00:17:37,374 --> 00:17:39,076
Hey, Insta, what's up?

261
00:17:39,109 --> 00:17:41,445
Yes, I'm back from Vegas
with my boy Jett here,

262
00:17:41,746 --> 00:17:46,383
about to be arrested for child abuse.
Come on, Sport.

263
00:17:50,955 --> 00:17:51,956
That's right.

264
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:53,925
Come on Jett, get fisted, baby.
Get fisted.

265
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:55,760
Take three,

266
00:17:55,793 --> 00:17:58,262
maybe put on some of that Call Me
Maybe shit it'll wake his ass up.

267
00:18:01,733 --> 00:18:02,867
Holy crap.

268
00:18:03,601 --> 00:18:04,903
Finish him, what you doing?

269
00:18:04,936 --> 00:18:05,937
This is fucking stupid.

270
00:18:07,772 --> 00:18:09,273
You hit me in the fucking face,
huh?

271
00:18:09,306 --> 00:18:14,913
Fuck off. Fuck off.
Fuck off. Fuck. I tap.

272
00:18:14,946 --> 00:18:16,079
How's that feel?

273
00:18:16,113 --> 00:18:17,281
Fuck off.

274
00:18:17,314 --> 00:18:21,786
Yo, Patty, you delete that shit.
Now.

275
00:18:21,819 --> 00:18:24,923
I'm deleting. Jesus.

276
00:18:27,959 --> 00:18:33,765
[music]

277
00:18:33,998 --> 00:18:36,935
Hey, Quinn, go to bed.

278
00:18:36,968 --> 00:18:37,936
Am I good?

279
00:18:37,969 --> 00:18:39,904
Yes, solid, Q.

280
00:18:39,938 --> 00:18:42,139
Keep practicing you can be in a real
band soon slay babes left and right.

281
00:18:42,172 --> 00:18:42,807
Now got to bed.

282
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,408
[laughs] Slay babe.

283
00:18:47,645 --> 00:18:48,646
Hey, Jett.

284
00:18:49,146 --> 00:18:50,447
What?

285
00:18:50,481 --> 00:18:52,416
I have a question.
Do some girls have wieners?

286
00:18:53,751 --> 00:18:55,152
Where'd you hear that?

287
00:18:55,185 --> 00:18:56,420
I saw it on benaughty.com
[chuckles].

288
00:18:56,454 --> 00:18:58,623
Are you visiting those sites
again?

289
00:19:00,858 --> 00:19:02,159
Do you want mom to kill you?

290
00:19:03,126 --> 00:19:04,428
I won't do it again. I promise.

291
00:19:04,462 --> 00:19:06,096
Well, you do it again
and I'm telling her.

292
00:19:06,129 --> 00:19:07,498
Because it's weird, right?

293
00:19:07,532 --> 00:19:09,767
Yes. Very.
Now look, it's 10:20 go to sleep.

294
00:19:11,435 --> 00:19:13,270
Oh wait, did I have melatonin?

295
00:19:14,973 --> 00:19:15,807
Yes.

296
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,975
Can you have mom peek on me?

297
00:19:17,809 --> 00:19:18,943
Yes.

298
00:19:20,044 --> 00:19:21,111
You promise?

299
00:19:21,546 --> 00:19:22,647
Yes.

300
00:19:23,447 --> 00:19:25,083
Okay, love you, Jett.

301
00:19:25,115 --> 00:19:26,017
Love you too.

302
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:29,520
More than yourself? Say it.

303
00:19:29,554 --> 00:19:31,990
More than myself. Now go to
sleep.

304
00:19:41,065 --> 00:19:42,165
Hey.

305
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,902
Hey.

306
00:19:46,838 --> 00:19:48,006
Not again mom.

307
00:19:48,873 --> 00:19:51,009
Made $200 in four hours.

308
00:19:51,042 --> 00:19:53,711
It's twice what I make at Pro
Sport.

309
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,648
Where?

310
00:19:56,681 --> 00:19:57,682
The Yard.

311
00:19:57,715 --> 00:19:59,249
Mom, everyone we know goes
there.

312
00:20:00,718 --> 00:20:02,053
Don't give me that look.

313
00:20:03,855 --> 00:20:08,059
Physical therapists at 41 is great
but waitress at 41 is pathetic.

314
00:20:09,861 --> 00:20:12,063
Providing for my boys is
pathetic?

315
00:20:19,037 --> 00:20:20,038
How many nights a week?

316
00:20:21,338 --> 00:20:23,074
No ballpark. Three, four?

317
00:20:23,107 --> 00:20:24,142
Yes.

318
00:20:24,174 --> 00:20:25,342
Four nights a week, I have
Quinn?

319
00:20:27,078 --> 00:20:28,513
He's making millions.

320
00:20:29,947 --> 00:20:31,582
You want to ask him for more
money?

321
00:20:31,616 --> 00:20:33,051
Because I'm not doing that.

322
00:20:35,687 --> 00:20:37,622
[sighs]

323
00:20:38,288 --> 00:20:41,291
[tap water running]

324
00:20:42,627 --> 00:20:45,362
I fought that son of a bitch
in court for 10 years.

325
00:20:46,097 --> 00:20:50,267
All the while, he never gave me
a dime for Quinn's heart surgery,

326
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,202
never a dime
for his stomach surgery.

327
00:20:54,138 --> 00:20:56,107
I know he's back in your life,

328
00:20:56,741 --> 00:21:00,144
and I know he's helping you follow
your dreams, so I keep quiet,

329
00:21:01,979 --> 00:21:04,082
but it's real goddamn hard,
Jett.

330
00:21:07,652 --> 00:21:14,592
[phone ringing]

331
00:21:20,131 --> 00:21:22,800
[background noise]

332
00:21:23,134 --> 00:21:24,168
Got you good today?

333
00:21:25,503 --> 00:21:29,774
Yes, I do. That was only
the second time in what?

334
00:21:30,808 --> 00:21:34,344
22 years of fighting that
I got caught by a roundhouse.

335
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:38,549
Yes? When was the first?

336
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:41,152
10 years ago, Claude.

337
00:21:42,352 --> 00:21:44,222
Is that the only time
you ever lost a fight?

338
00:21:44,254 --> 00:21:46,791
In my life? Fuck, no.

339
00:21:48,192 --> 00:21:50,128
Birmingham's 75% black.

340
00:21:50,795 --> 00:21:53,430
Homies went Reginald
Denny on my ass hourly.

341
00:21:56,167 --> 00:21:59,203
Hey, I got a nice
surprise for you tomorrow.

342
00:22:00,337 --> 00:22:01,105
Don't be late.

343
00:22:01,639 --> 00:22:03,340
What is it?

344
00:22:15,186 --> 00:22:18,122
Then we multiply
all of this by delta X,

345
00:22:18,156 --> 00:22:21,291
which is two over N, and this is
going to be the setup for rewriting

346
00:22:21,324 --> 00:22:23,161
our definite integral
using Riemann sum.

347
00:22:23,194 --> 00:22:25,696
[bell ringing] Have a good after
day, everyone.

348
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:29,167
[background noise]

349
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,201
How did you do?

350
00:22:32,369 --> 00:22:33,137
Oh, sorry.

351
00:22:33,171 --> 00:22:33,971
It's not your fault.

352
00:22:34,005 --> 00:22:36,841
[background noise]

353
00:22:37,241 --> 00:22:41,179
Bye, good job. See you. Good
job.

354
00:22:41,212 --> 00:22:44,081
Great work. Good job. Great
work.

355
00:22:44,414 --> 00:22:45,850
Yes, well, wish me luck.

356
00:22:46,383 --> 00:22:48,186
What are you doing after
school?

357
00:22:48,219 --> 00:22:49,253
Ms. Malek.

358
00:22:49,654 --> 00:22:50,655
Hello, Jett.

359
00:22:51,388 --> 00:22:52,857
Is there anything I can do?

360
00:22:53,858 --> 00:22:56,093
Yes, you can avoid Las Vegas.

361
00:22:56,426 --> 00:22:57,795
That trip was planned.

362
00:22:57,829 --> 00:22:59,230
You've known about
this test for a month, Jett.

363
00:22:59,263 --> 00:23:01,265
Oh,
what if I did some extra credit?

364
00:23:02,332 --> 00:23:03,568
[sighs]

365
00:23:03,601 --> 00:23:05,670
I think it runs a little
deeper than that.

366
00:23:06,237 --> 00:23:07,370
That 41 was generous.

367
00:23:12,009 --> 00:23:14,846
Look, you missed a lot
of important stuff last year.

368
00:23:16,346 --> 00:23:17,347
What about a tutor?

369
00:23:18,716 --> 00:23:19,984
If I don't pass your class,
I don't graduate.

370
00:23:20,017 --> 00:23:21,185
Just $25 an hour.

371
00:23:23,588 --> 00:23:24,589
Whatever it takes.

372
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:32,530
[music]

373
00:24:15,907 --> 00:24:16,908
Yo, Chief.

374
00:24:19,143 --> 00:24:20,144
You ready?

375
00:24:21,312 --> 00:24:22,313
Yes.

376
00:24:32,089 --> 00:24:33,691
Meet your sparring partner?

377
00:24:36,761 --> 00:24:38,763
You want me to spar
Enrique Castaneda?

378
00:24:39,429 --> 00:24:41,465
Number three
welterweight in the world.

379
00:24:41,499 --> 00:24:42,600
We got to fix your jab.

380
00:24:48,973 --> 00:24:51,441
Excuse me. Are you okay?

381
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:53,277
Are you sure?

382
00:24:54,211 --> 00:24:56,347
Yes. I'm fine, ma'am.

383
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:59,317
I appreciate your concern though.
Thank you.

384
00:25:02,353 --> 00:25:03,754
Okay. Hey, y'all.

385
00:25:03,788 --> 00:25:06,324
[background noise]

386
00:25:06,691 --> 00:25:08,092
Quinn, look towards me, please.

387
00:25:08,125 --> 00:25:09,026
I'm watching the game.

388
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,528
There's no TV in here, Quinn.

389
00:25:10,561 --> 00:25:12,430
Just shut up and look towards
me.

390
00:25:12,463 --> 00:25:14,365
Finish your hamburger. Now.

391
00:25:26,911 --> 00:25:29,513
I'm going to go watch the game.

392
00:25:29,547 --> 00:25:31,315
[crosstalk] Hi.
Yes, is this Johnny?

393
00:25:32,483 --> 00:25:36,387
My name is Jett Boykins.
I am a senior at Ramsey High.

394
00:25:38,055 --> 00:25:39,323
Hi.

395
00:25:39,357 --> 00:25:40,459
Hello. [chuckles]

396
00:25:40,491 --> 00:25:42,560
My name is Quinn. What's your
name?

397
00:25:42,593 --> 00:25:45,029
I was referred to you by Ms.
Malek.

398
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:47,531
I have a question.

399
00:25:47,565 --> 00:25:49,033
Yes?

400
00:25:49,066 --> 00:25:51,569
Do you like every shake out
your tongues at each other?

401
00:25:51,602 --> 00:25:54,572
Yes, that works perfectly.

402
00:25:54,605 --> 00:25:56,407
Thank you and I'll talk to you.
Bye.

403
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,142
So did you want to see it?

404
00:25:58,175 --> 00:25:59,844
We're sorry to bother you, ma'am.
Start walking, Quinn.

405
00:25:59,877 --> 00:26:01,245
Hey, stop pushing me.

406
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:02,413
What happened to your face?

407
00:26:02,446 --> 00:26:03,482
I got my butt kicked.

408
00:26:03,514 --> 00:26:04,048
Stop.

409
00:26:04,081 --> 00:26:05,082
Shut up.

410
00:26:07,451 --> 00:26:08,453
Get in the car.

411
00:26:10,054 --> 00:26:12,623
[car door opening]

412
00:26:13,557 --> 00:26:15,059
What is your freaking problem,
Jett?

413
00:26:15,092 --> 00:26:17,094
It's all just so weird and
disturbing okay?

414
00:26:17,428 --> 00:26:19,764
I can't take it any fucking
more.

415
00:26:19,797 --> 00:26:21,500
Well, I have bullied syndrome.

416
00:26:21,532 --> 00:26:22,400
Don't give me that bullshit.

417
00:26:22,433 --> 00:26:23,567
It's my fault.

418
00:26:23,601 --> 00:26:24,435
Yes, whose fault is it then?

419
00:26:24,469 --> 00:26:25,603
You're such a jerk.

420
00:26:25,636 --> 00:26:27,204
Ow.

421
00:26:35,046 --> 00:26:36,080
I hate you.

422
00:26:36,113 --> 00:26:37,114
I hate you back.

423
00:26:38,549 --> 00:26:39,917
[sniffles]

424
00:26:40,317 --> 00:26:41,419
That hurt.

425
00:26:45,923 --> 00:26:46,924
Hey, Jett,

426
00:26:50,127 --> 00:26:51,796
care to listen to Christmas
music?

427
00:26:57,502 --> 00:26:59,970
You would have been
so proud of Kingston today.

428
00:27:00,004 --> 00:27:03,542
Mr. Tanaka moves him up
from an orange belt to a green.

429
00:27:03,574 --> 00:27:05,576
Hold on. He skipped blue?

430
00:27:05,609 --> 00:27:07,479
He number one for his age.

431
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:09,647
[laughter]

432
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,948
Little fucking stud.

433
00:27:11,615 --> 00:27:12,683
I love you.

434
00:27:13,518 --> 00:27:19,423
I love you too, baby. What?

435
00:27:19,458 --> 00:27:20,459
What's wrong?

436
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:23,360
I think I'm going to be sick.

437
00:27:23,627 --> 00:27:24,728
We should go.

438
00:27:24,762 --> 00:27:25,996
I just ordered the bone-in.

439
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:28,632
I know.
I'll order you whatever you want.

440
00:27:28,666 --> 00:27:30,469
Please, I'm going to throw up.
Okay.

441
00:27:30,935 --> 00:27:33,304
All right. All right.

442
00:27:34,271 --> 00:27:41,178
[background noise]

443
00:27:43,948 --> 00:27:45,316
Shit.

444
00:27:50,688 --> 00:27:53,492
You sexy little minx.

445
00:27:56,894 --> 00:27:58,395
Fuck, you're so beautiful.

446
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:03,667
You're so fucking beautiful.

447
00:28:03,701 --> 00:28:05,669
[chuckles] I love you.

448
00:28:05,703 --> 00:28:08,172
I love you.

449
00:28:12,409 --> 00:28:13,644
Fuck.

450
00:28:14,912 --> 00:28:16,113
Hey.

451
00:28:16,147 --> 00:28:17,181
Yes, what's up?

452
00:28:17,214 --> 00:28:19,083
Can we just talk for a second,
please?

453
00:28:19,551 --> 00:28:21,685
Didn't we already
talk enough at dinner?

454
00:28:23,588 --> 00:28:24,989
Let's see.

455
00:28:26,657 --> 00:28:31,896
Kingston's kicking ass in karate
and you want a bodyguard, right?

456
00:28:32,897 --> 00:28:33,898
It's about Susan.

457
00:28:35,232 --> 00:28:39,436
I just went limp. Thanks. Fuck.

458
00:28:40,738 --> 00:28:42,373
[grunts]

459
00:28:43,908 --> 00:28:45,376
Listen.

460
00:28:45,409 --> 00:28:47,546
I know you insist on keeping
her stuff separate from me.

461
00:28:47,579 --> 00:28:50,549
I don't insist on anything.
We have a contract, remember?

462
00:28:50,582 --> 00:28:53,217
Okay, well, I'm sorry to tell
you this but I'm your wife.

463
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,752
I'm going to have
an opinion or two on certain

464
00:28:54,785 --> 00:28:59,323
topics which means you are
required to listen to me. Okay?

465
00:28:59,356 --> 00:29:00,724
Okay. Go.

466
00:29:04,028 --> 00:29:05,196
Cash, they need money.

467
00:29:06,263 --> 00:29:07,932
Where is this shit coming from,
babe?

468
00:29:07,965 --> 00:29:10,434
I've been thinking about this
shit for the past nine years.

469
00:29:10,468 --> 00:29:11,769
We never help with Quinn.

470
00:29:11,802 --> 00:29:13,370
He's not your son, Jade.

471
00:29:13,404 --> 00:29:16,575
No, he's not.
He's your son but that doesn't mean

472
00:29:16,608 --> 00:29:18,709
I'm not allowed to help care for
him, does it?

473
00:29:18,742 --> 00:29:21,580
Fine. Take him for an
afternoon.

474
00:29:21,613 --> 00:29:24,215
Have Kingston play with him.
Great, but that's it.

475
00:29:24,248 --> 00:29:27,686
Why? Why, Cash?
Why can't we just love him?

476
00:29:27,718 --> 00:29:29,353
Love him like we love Kingston?

477
00:29:29,386 --> 00:29:31,355
Because he won't love us back.

478
00:29:31,388 --> 00:29:34,258
My god. Of course, he will.
Why do you say that?

479
00:29:34,291 --> 00:29:35,594
Why do you even think that?

480
00:29:35,627 --> 00:29:37,428
Because she lied to them about
me.

481
00:29:37,462 --> 00:29:38,630
Cash, you hit her.

482
00:29:38,663 --> 00:29:40,665
Yes, after she attacked me,
honey.

483
00:29:41,298 --> 00:29:43,801
I had to wait two years
before I could even see them.

484
00:29:44,168 --> 00:29:48,640
No, she lied to the cops.
She lied on the stand. Fuck her.

485
00:29:48,673 --> 00:29:50,441
She gets what she gets
and she shouldn't

486
00:29:50,475 --> 00:29:51,643
be throwing a fucking fit about
it.

487
00:29:51,676 --> 00:29:54,144
Because of her,
they have to suffer?

488
00:29:54,178 --> 00:30:00,084
Suffer? No, they learn.
Hard work, adversity, struggle.

489
00:30:00,117 --> 00:30:01,653
That's how winners are made,

490
00:30:01,686 --> 00:30:03,787
not cuddling Kingston
around like a fucking...

491
00:30:03,821 --> 00:30:05,256
No, no, no don't you
fucking do that shit.

492
00:30:05,289 --> 00:30:06,625
Don't fucking start with me,
Cash.

493
00:30:06,658 --> 00:30:09,393
I took fights for 2000.
I worked two jobs.

494
00:30:09,426 --> 00:30:10,761
I had two little kids.

495
00:30:10,794 --> 00:30:13,097
We were this close to
being homeless, baby.

496
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:15,232
My old man didn't give me jack
shit.

497
00:30:15,266 --> 00:30:18,002
Your old man was an abusive drunk
who didn't have jackshit to give you.

498
00:30:18,035 --> 00:30:23,207
If I give money to Susan, she gives
money to Jett and that can't happen.

499
00:30:23,874 --> 00:30:26,844
We have four houses and nine
cars.

500
00:30:26,877 --> 00:30:28,245
I'm done talking about this.

501
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:30,314
Four houses and nine cars,
Cash.

502
00:30:30,347 --> 00:30:31,750
Jade, fuck you.

503
00:30:31,782 --> 00:30:33,752
Fuck you, get the fuck out of
here.

504
00:30:33,784 --> 00:30:35,487
Yes, I will you fucking cunt.

505
00:30:41,726 --> 00:30:42,527
Hi.

506
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,561
Hey.

507
00:30:46,363 --> 00:30:47,699
Did Quinn go to bed okay?

508
00:30:47,732 --> 00:30:49,233
Yes.

509
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,148
I'm a terrible mother.

510
00:31:04,181 --> 00:31:04,948
Mom.

511
00:31:04,982 --> 00:31:06,250
How do I allow my child?

512
00:31:06,718 --> 00:31:08,018
This is who I am.

513
00:31:09,688 --> 00:31:11,790
Fighting isn't who you are,
it's what you do.

514
00:31:11,822 --> 00:31:13,692
Clearly I fucking suck at it.

515
00:31:16,695 --> 00:31:18,329
Bud, what happened?

516
00:31:19,731 --> 00:31:21,832
I got my ass fed to me, Mom.

517
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:30,709
No, with Q.

518
00:31:35,913 --> 00:31:37,549
I just wish I had someone else,

519
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:43,588
someone to share with
because it never stops.

520
00:31:44,121 --> 00:31:45,956
I always feel like a failure.

521
00:31:51,796 --> 00:31:56,400
I ask a lot of you,
it's not fair, it's not.

522
00:32:03,907 --> 00:32:08,780
Did I ever tell you about my first
Williams Syndrome convention?

523
00:32:10,782 --> 00:32:11,783
No.

524
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:14,719
I had no clue what
I was getting into.

525
00:32:16,554 --> 00:32:20,924
Quinn had just been
diagnosed and I entered this

526
00:32:20,958 --> 00:32:26,798
hotel lobby and saw 400
little Willy's running around.

527
00:32:26,831 --> 00:32:28,466
I'm like, "Oh my God."

528
00:32:32,002 --> 00:32:37,776
I was like a zombie going from
session to session obsessed with

529
00:32:38,442 --> 00:32:41,245
getting information
to somehow fix this

530
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:44,783
problem and I hadn't even cried
yet.

531
00:32:45,583 --> 00:32:48,820
When a mother learns that she's going
to have to take care of a special

532
00:32:48,853 --> 00:32:53,357
needs child for the rest of her
life she requires a good cry. Right?

533
00:32:53,858 --> 00:32:56,861
Yes, you didn't cry. Not once.

534
00:33:00,297 --> 00:33:03,000
Then I went into the last
session of the weekend.

535
00:33:04,368 --> 00:33:05,837
It was on siblings.

536
00:33:06,937 --> 00:33:11,476
There was this doctor up there with
this long grey hair and this beard,

537
00:33:12,276 --> 00:33:15,012
all these years
of research and experience.

538
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:20,083
He was talking about how
brothers and sisters of kids with

539
00:33:20,117 --> 00:33:23,922
special needs turn
out to be the most

540
00:33:23,954 --> 00:33:28,460
wonderful loving, giving adults.

541
00:33:29,727 --> 00:33:33,898
I just lost it.

542
00:33:35,032 --> 00:33:38,536
I could not stop crying,
tears just...

543
00:33:42,072 --> 00:33:43,708
because I knew that would be
you.

544
00:33:58,723 --> 00:33:59,724
How's the grill?

545
00:34:02,494 --> 00:34:03,728
Hurts.

546
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:07,264
Yes, well you'll recover.

547
00:34:07,866 --> 00:34:09,032
I know I will recover.

548
00:34:11,435 --> 00:34:14,037
Look, sometimes it just seems
like you like seeing me hurt.

549
00:34:14,071 --> 00:34:15,907
What the fuck do
you know about hurt?

550
00:34:21,513 --> 00:34:22,714
I'm sorry.

551
00:34:25,583 --> 00:34:26,918
You should check
out my fight against

552
00:34:26,951 --> 00:34:29,754
Ricky Promoter Co
at some point tomorrow.

553
00:34:31,288 --> 00:34:34,592
Pay close attention to my
striking and side leg kicks.

554
00:34:35,125 --> 00:34:36,393
You're telling me this why?

555
00:34:36,426 --> 00:34:38,262
You need to get away from your
judo, Sport.

556
00:34:39,096 --> 00:34:41,766
Destroyed Randa,
it will destroy you.

557
00:34:43,133 --> 00:34:44,903
Jaime wants his fighters
upright,

558
00:34:45,402 --> 00:34:49,741
not swap and spit on the canvas,
capisce?

559
00:34:50,073 --> 00:34:51,074
Kapsosh.

560
00:34:57,782 --> 00:34:58,950
El hombre.

561
00:34:58,983 --> 00:34:59,918
Woman.

562
00:34:59,951 --> 00:35:01,218
La mujer.

563
00:35:01,753 --> 00:35:02,587
Male friend.

564
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:03,955
El amigo.

565
00:35:03,988 --> 00:35:04,689
Female friend.

566
00:35:04,722 --> 00:35:05,723
La amiga.

567
00:35:07,592 --> 00:35:08,760
Es muy guapo.

568
00:35:09,961 --> 00:35:13,765
Hey, I'm sorry I lost it.

569
00:35:16,166 --> 00:35:16,935
Love you, buddy.

570
00:35:18,002 --> 00:35:19,470
I won't do that again, okay?

571
00:35:19,504 --> 00:35:20,738
Okay.

572
00:35:20,772 --> 00:35:21,773
Are we even?

573
00:35:22,974 --> 00:35:24,776
I'll let you beat me
the next we wrestle.

574
00:35:24,809 --> 00:35:25,810
Just once.

575
00:35:25,843 --> 00:35:27,612
[laughs]

576
00:35:27,645 --> 00:35:31,950
This week we are still using derivatives
to figure out limits but now,

577
00:35:32,517 --> 00:35:37,120
we're looking at limits that
end in indeterminate form.

578
00:35:37,755 --> 00:35:43,160
This is called L'Hôpital's rule.

579
00:35:43,193 --> 00:35:50,167
[background noise]

580
00:35:58,843 --> 00:36:01,980
[phones ringing]

581
00:36:02,212 --> 00:36:03,982
I just watched the Prootr Co
fight.

582
00:36:04,348 --> 00:36:06,651
Hey, Sport. I just woke up
late.

583
00:36:06,684 --> 00:36:08,151
Can we talk about this at the
gym?

584
00:36:08,185 --> 00:36:09,954
No. Don't give me that. What
gives?

585
00:36:10,888 --> 00:36:14,058
Ricky was supposed to fight Mitch
Radowski next month in Memphis.

586
00:36:14,859 --> 00:36:16,461
Mitch broke his hand yesterday.

587
00:36:16,494 --> 00:36:19,097
Serious? Hell, put me in coach.

588
00:36:19,129 --> 00:36:23,133
Jett, he's a tough fucking thick
neck with 28 fights under his belt.

589
00:36:23,468 --> 00:36:25,036
You have three.

590
00:36:25,069 --> 00:36:27,071
Come on, anytime,
anywhere on a moment's notice, Chief.

591
00:36:29,306 --> 00:36:31,776
All right, pussy hole,
I'll get into it.

592
00:36:31,809 --> 00:36:33,143
All right.

593
00:36:34,378 --> 00:36:36,481
Say it, Quinn. Fuck.

594
00:36:36,514 --> 00:36:39,383
I'm not going to say it.
My mom will kill me.

595
00:36:39,416 --> 00:36:42,152
How will she know? Come on.
Fuck.

596
00:36:42,185 --> 00:36:44,689
Hey, Patrick,
that's not how we roll, my man.

597
00:36:44,722 --> 00:36:47,157
What did I do? Fine.

598
00:36:47,492 --> 00:36:49,894
Hey, kid. Guess what, you get to
ride the bus home with Gerry today.

599
00:36:49,927 --> 00:36:53,230
Wait. What? No chance. No.

600
00:36:53,698 --> 00:36:55,432
What do you mean? You love the
bus.

601
00:36:55,833 --> 00:36:56,901
Not anymore. I don't.

602
00:36:56,934 --> 00:36:58,402
Tanner Van Holt rides it now.

603
00:36:58,435 --> 00:37:00,138
You think I'm bad?

604
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:02,406
Yes. He said Santa isn't real.

605
00:37:02,439 --> 00:37:04,042
Get out.

606
00:37:04,075 --> 00:37:06,276
Last week, you threw Jerry's
thermos right out the window.

607
00:37:08,445 --> 00:37:09,847
Buy you a new one, Gerry?

608
00:37:12,917 --> 00:37:14,018
Come point him out to me.

609
00:37:17,088 --> 00:37:21,959
Tanner, Van, Holt, number
71.

610
00:37:24,462 --> 00:37:28,198
Hey, Tanner. I'm Jett.

611
00:37:28,466 --> 00:37:30,068
Yes, I know who you are.

612
00:37:30,868 --> 00:37:33,538
You threw Gerry's thermos
off the bus window last week?

613
00:37:35,073 --> 00:37:36,741
I didn't know it was his.

614
00:37:36,774 --> 00:37:38,776
It was rolling around
everyone's feet.

615
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:41,612
Right. Well, I'm afraid you're going
to have to buy him a new one, my man.

616
00:37:41,646 --> 00:37:47,952
I'm not sure if that's
going to happen, Jett.

617
00:37:47,985 --> 00:37:51,055
It's not a fucking question.
Get him a new fucking thermos.

618
00:37:51,089 --> 00:37:52,289
All right, man. You got it.

619
00:37:52,322 --> 00:37:53,191
You got that?

620
00:37:53,223 --> 00:37:54,092
Yes, man.

621
00:37:54,125 --> 00:37:55,493
Get the fuck out of here.

622
00:37:59,396 --> 00:38:00,397
Hey, Jett.

623
00:38:01,966 --> 00:38:04,535
You think you could have handled
that a bit more diplomatically?

624
00:38:04,569 --> 00:38:05,570
Diplomatically?

625
00:38:06,003 --> 00:38:07,171
Yes, like an adult?

626
00:38:08,773 --> 00:38:10,074
You'll never understand.

627
00:38:10,108 --> 00:38:11,909
I understand a jerk when I see
one.

628
00:38:13,243 --> 00:38:17,247
Can you go ask Tanner nicely if
he'll buy Gerry a new thermos?

629
00:38:17,482 --> 00:38:18,483
Can you do that?

630
00:38:19,349 --> 00:38:20,118
Yes.

631
00:38:20,417 --> 00:38:21,753
You're better than that.

632
00:38:24,689 --> 00:38:30,161
Control the head. Control the head.
Grab your shirt. First triangle.

633
00:38:30,194 --> 00:38:31,328
[grunting]

634
00:38:31,361 --> 00:38:32,797
Good.

635
00:38:34,165 --> 00:38:34,999
God. [grunts]

636
00:38:35,032 --> 00:38:36,333
Nice.

637
00:38:36,366 --> 00:38:39,670
Hey, Sport. Memphis.
Three weeks. Get psyched.

638
00:38:39,704 --> 00:38:42,607
[cheers] [chuckles] Are you
ready, Kareef?

639

[background noise]

640
00:38:52,216 --> 00:38:54,986
You went through a stoplight
with an open container?

641
00:38:57,221 --> 00:38:59,223
Nice example you're
setting for your kid.

642
00:39:00,323 --> 00:39:04,228
Well, you got to learn how to drive
with an OC at some point, sport.

643
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:09,133
Okay. Rule number one, always
keep

644
00:39:09,167 --> 00:39:11,301
your roadie stove
between your thighs.

645
00:39:11,334 --> 00:39:15,206
When a cop pulls you over,
his first glance is always the cupholder.

646
00:39:16,474 --> 00:39:20,244
Rule number two, never sip while
flying through an intersection.

647
00:39:20,678 --> 00:39:23,313
You got a lot of liberal
homos out there

648
00:39:23,346 --> 00:39:25,483
who'd love to call 911 on your
ass.

649
00:39:26,416 --> 00:39:30,454
Don't let liberal homos see me
drinking while driving. Got it.

650
00:39:30,488 --> 00:39:33,724
Rule number three,
before each swig,

651
00:39:33,758 --> 00:39:36,494
you check your side
views and your rear views.

652

653
00:39:43,067 --> 00:39:46,237
Rule number four,
in case of an emergency,

654
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:49,106
hide the said beer in son's
pocket.

Yes, sir.

666
00:41:01,444 --> 00:41:02,445
Any day.

667
00:41:05,082 --> 00:41:06,484
Thank you, sir.

668
00:41:06,517 --> 00:41:07,450
Yes, sure thing.

669

Again, my bad.

670
00:41:08,953 --> 00:41:09,620
Yes, sir.

671
00:41:09,654 --> 00:41:10,988

apply.

Come on in, Chief?
Two minutes? Come on, man.

682
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:45,389
Explain the deal. Get her pumped.

Hey. I've got a surprise.

688
00:41:57,201 --> 00:41:58,836
Quinn, how's it hanging?

689
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:00,471
Good.

690
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:03,507
Susie.

691
00:42:04,475 --> 00:42:05,376
Cash.

692
00:42:06,577 --> 00:42:08,713
Look, you two need to talk.

693
00:42:09,347 --> 00:42:11,215
Will you both please
take the high road?

694
00:42:11,515 --> 00:42:13,417
I have, hundreds of times.

695
00:42:14,185 --> 00:42:15,353
The low road's better.

[chuckles]

697
00:42:20,591 --> 00:42:23,527
Jett, can you get a
bath going for Quinn?

698
00:42:24,662 --> 00:42:25,563
He's stinky.

699
00:42:25,596 --> 00:42:27,531
No, I'll put on deoderant.

700
00:42:27,565 --> 00:42:29,367
No, you need to soak, okay?

701
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,035
Come on, Quinn. Let's go.

702
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:34,271
All right, guys.

703
00:42:39,877 --> 00:42:41,012
Got anything to drink?

704
00:42:41,445 --> 00:42:44,215

00:43:02,233 --> 00:43:05,369
I can remember your Two-Buck
Chucks smelling like cat piss.

712
00:43:05,403 --> 00:43:07,104
You don't remember a lot of
things.

713
00:43:07,772 --> 00:43:12,243
Oh, fuck me. I walked
right into that one, didn't I?

714
00:43:16,213 --> 00:43:17,715
What do I owe this pleasure?

715
00:43:21,486 --> 00:43:23,455
Got Jett a fight for the 28th.

716
00:43:24,288 --> 00:43:30,594
WFA 247 in Memphis, third undercard
against Tricky Ricky Promotor Co.

717
00:43:31,496 --> 00:43:32,396
Remember him?

718
00:43:33,465 --> 00:43:34,466
Jesus.

719
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,270
Number 12 contender, should
be a solid litmus test for him.

720
00:43:40,004 --> 00:43:41,005
Can he beat him?

721
00:43:42,606 --> 00:43:44,608
Well, his kickboxing
certainly improved.

722
00:43:44,642 --> 00:43:45,876
His grappling's solid.

723
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:46,911
What about his judo?

724
00:43:46,944 --> 00:43:49,580
Fuck judo. What he needs is a
jab.

725
00:43:49,613 --> 00:43:50,614
So find him one.

726
00:43:57,822 --> 00:43:59,458
Does he need to miss school?

727
00:44:01,125 --> 00:44:03,260
No. No, shouldn't.

728
00:44:04,261 --> 00:44:07,264
Two hours with Kareef before
and after school should suffice.

729
00:44:12,504 --> 00:44:13,971
How much?

730
00:44:14,004 --> 00:44:18,309
WFA minimum, $10,000 a show,
another $10,000 for a win.

731
00:44:18,709 --> 00:44:20,711
I may be able to bump
that up to $15,000.

732
00:44:22,514 --> 00:44:25,550
I could front you $10,000 now
if you need help with Quinn.

733
00:44:27,051 --> 00:44:29,386
We're not a fucking daycare
service, Susan.

734
00:44:32,323 --> 00:44:33,824
Yes. That was my fault, I'm
sorry.

735
00:44:33,858 --> 00:44:37,161
I knew you were incapable,
but I rolled the dice anyway.

736
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:39,531
All right.

737
00:44:41,298 --> 00:44:45,202
Well, I'll have Patty wire the
10Gs into your account tomorrow.

738
00:44:46,538 --> 00:44:47,671
You're welcome, Susie.

739
00:44:48,339 --> 00:44:49,740
Fuck you, Cash.

740
00:44:51,543 --> 00:44:55,679
[footsteps]

741
00:44:55,713 --> 00:44:56,680
[door opens]

742
00:44:57,715 --> 00:44:58,483
[door closes]

743
00:45:01,919 --> 00:45:03,787
[crowd cheers]

744
00:45:03,821 --> 00:45:06,690
Boykins, take a seat.
I'm now pissed.

745
00:45:09,426 --> 00:45:11,195
Fucking stinks like a bitch.

746
00:45:11,228 --> 00:45:13,731
Fuck it. Your inside
leg kicks are killing him.

747
00:45:13,764 --> 00:45:15,733
He opened himself
up to a traingle chop.

748
00:45:15,766 --> 00:45:17,701
I know. I fucking blew it.

749
00:45:17,735 --> 00:45:19,604
If he does it again,
you put him to sleep.

750
00:45:20,171 --> 00:45:21,405
Time is up.

751
00:45:21,906 --> 00:45:23,207
Let's end this shit now.

752
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:24,975
Go, baby. Let's go.
Let's go. [bell rings]

753
00:45:25,009 --> 00:45:26,578
How did you score round two,
Tyron?

754
00:45:26,611 --> 00:45:27,711
I had that as a-

755
00:45:27,745 --> 00:45:28,647
- Keep your focus. Stay focus
now.

756
00:45:28,679 --> 00:45:29,747
big round for Boykin.

757
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:30,649
Barely minimal.
It's 10, nine, nine.

758
00:45:30,681 --> 00:45:32,416
Come on, Champ. Not this.

759
00:45:33,384 --> 00:45:35,753
It's been a very
close fight so far.

760
00:45:35,786 --> 00:45:38,789
It may very well come
down to round three here.

761
00:45:39,356 --> 00:45:41,560
Moleko is very fast.
That's a fast one.

762
00:45:41,593 --> 00:45:42,193
I know.

763
00:45:42,226 --> 00:45:42,860
[screams]

764
00:45:42,893 --> 00:45:43,794
That's the kick.

765
00:45:46,598 --> 00:45:48,600
He's going for a heel hook.

766
00:45:50,367 --> 00:45:52,069
What an escape by Boykins.

767
00:45:52,803 --> 00:45:55,039
Get this motherfucker. [cheers]

768
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:58,842
Counter. Big counter.
He's looking to-

769
00:45:58,876 --> 00:46:03,615
- I think it's a counter. Ground
and pound. I think he's back up.

770
00:46:03,648 --> 00:46:05,783
They are eating some
huge shock to this fight.

771
00:46:05,816 --> 00:46:07,451
Look at this, a luminary rope.

772
00:46:07,785 --> 00:46:09,787
Rolls right into his shoulder
lock.

773
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:11,855
Over plot. Now, we do a
triangle.

774
00:46:11,889 --> 00:46:16,227
Come on. [cheers]

775
00:46:16,727 --> 00:46:17,728
There you go.

776
00:46:18,963 --> 00:46:20,864
He takes the advantage.
Now going for the body.

777
00:46:20,898 --> 00:46:23,602
He's taking punches but he's
dishing him out as well.

778
00:46:23,635 --> 00:46:24,401
Oh my...

779
00:46:24,435 --> 00:46:25,436
[screams]

780
00:46:25,836 --> 00:46:29,373
Going back and forth. [honks]

781
00:46:29,406 --> 00:46:31,742
Just exhausted to end round
three.

782
00:46:31,775 --> 00:46:33,645
It could come down
to a split decision.

783
00:46:33,678 --> 00:46:36,615
The fight was very close.
Even that round, it was a thing.

784
00:46:36,648 --> 00:46:39,651
What a fight. This is
really too close to call here.

785
00:46:39,684 --> 00:46:41,986
Now, you got that baby.
It's all you.

786
00:46:42,019 --> 00:46:43,220
[applause]

787
00:46:43,254 --> 00:46:44,855
The judges are taking their
time.

788
00:46:47,825 --> 00:46:50,595
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a split decision.

789
00:46:52,263 --> 00:46:56,767
Judge Watson scores the fight
29-28.

790
00:46:57,134 --> 00:46:59,638
Boykins. [cheers]

791
00:46:59,671 --> 00:47:00,804
You're a smart man.

792
00:47:00,838 --> 00:47:02,239
[claps]

793
00:47:02,273 --> 00:47:06,176
Judge Goldstone scores
the fight 30-27 for Motoco.

794
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:07,512
[cheers]

795
00:47:07,545 --> 00:47:08,812
You are a cheat.

796
00:47:08,846 --> 00:47:09,514
Come on.

797
00:47:09,547 --> 00:47:10,582
Nobody likes you.

798
00:47:10,615 --> 00:47:13,652
Judge Max scores the fight
29-28.

799
00:47:14,051 --> 00:47:18,422
The winner, the Pride of
Ramses High.

800
00:47:18,456 --> 00:47:20,257
[cheers]

801
00:47:20,291 --> 00:47:21,825
Jett Boykins is your winner.

802
00:47:21,859 --> 00:47:23,662
You showed a lot of heart there,
champ.

803
00:47:23,695 --> 00:47:25,129
Unbelievable fight.

804
00:47:25,162 --> 00:47:30,301
[crowd cheers]

805
00:47:35,873 --> 00:47:36,874
That's what I'm talking about.

806
00:47:36,907 --> 00:47:37,841
[claps]

807
00:47:37,875 --> 00:47:38,543
I didn't doubt it for a second.

808
00:47:38,576 --> 00:47:39,477
Come here.

809
00:47:39,511 --> 00:47:40,110
I didn't doubt it for a second.

810
00:47:40,144 --> 00:47:44,248
[crowd cheers]

811
00:47:44,716 --> 00:47:51,690
[music]

812
00:48:03,735 --> 00:48:06,771
Thank you. Good day. Good
stuff.

813
00:48:20,585 --> 00:48:21,753
That was super, Jett.

814
00:48:22,019 --> 00:48:26,223
Good for the soul, Jerry.
Your ball buster.

815
00:48:33,230 --> 00:48:34,932
Have you seen what's on chapter
15?

816
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:38,235
Point conversions.
That's what I live for.

817
00:48:38,636 --> 00:48:41,438
Now, you care about conversions.
You're on autopilot girl.

818
00:48:43,608 --> 00:48:44,809
What do you mean autopilot?

819
00:48:46,310 --> 00:48:48,879
You didn't hear?
Kim got accepted into West Point.

820
00:48:57,388 --> 00:48:58,757
Damn.

821
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:01,425
Is there anything you can't do?

822
00:49:08,767 --> 00:49:09,768
Don't get me wrong.

823
00:49:11,301 --> 00:49:15,139
I'm thankful to you both.
You built a $5 billion Goliath.

824
00:49:15,807 --> 00:49:19,611
As a result, many of us have
created a level of wealth behind

825
00:49:19,644 --> 00:49:23,280
our wildest dreams
but in the last five years,

826
00:49:23,848 --> 00:49:28,252
you think in addition to owning
the WFA, you own its fighters.

827
00:49:29,654 --> 00:49:31,556
I don't blame
you for thinking like that.

828
00:49:31,589 --> 00:49:36,594
We've allowed ourselves to be owned.
You got five bill.

829
00:49:37,161 --> 00:49:42,032
Well, 95% of your fighters under
your banner have very little savings,

830
00:49:42,634 --> 00:49:45,804
health insurance that only covers
injuries, no pension funds.

831
00:49:45,837 --> 00:49:47,938
You participate in revenue
sharing.

832
00:49:47,971 --> 00:49:49,106
Yes, we do, Jamie.

833
00:49:50,842 --> 00:49:55,480
Revenue sharing amongst the 512
WFA fighters under contract is 8%.

834
00:49:57,214 --> 00:50:00,485
NFL owners and players
split revenues 50-50.

835
00:50:00,885 --> 00:50:05,790
When you look at it like that, boys,
the WFA is a nice form of slavery.

836
00:50:06,724 --> 00:50:08,860
I have heard enough of this
shit.

837
00:50:08,893 --> 00:50:10,327
Calm down, Jamie.

838
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:13,030
We fighters,
we come from very little means, Rami.

839
00:50:14,131 --> 00:50:18,302
When I was in sixth grade,
Sherman Steel kicked my ass.

840
00:50:19,637 --> 00:50:22,607
I didn't come home for three
motherfucking days because

841
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:27,211
I knew my old man would beat me 10
times worse for, "Losing to a nigger."

842
00:50:27,978 --> 00:50:32,316
I remember my first MMA paycheck.
$1850.

843
00:50:33,417 --> 00:50:36,921
I went out, bought myself a 12'er
of Nati light, paid my rent,

844
00:50:37,321 --> 00:50:40,023
pulled Jamie aside, and said,
"God bless you, Messa.

845
00:50:40,324 --> 00:50:41,893
Thank you, thank you."

846
00:50:41,926 --> 00:50:44,027
You are such a prick. I can't...

847
00:50:44,061 --> 00:50:46,430
Goddammit, the truth hurts,
doesn't it, Jamie?

848
00:50:46,931 --> 00:50:51,836
Here's the deal,
I own two WFA belts.

849
00:50:52,704 --> 00:50:54,939
I bring in three million
pay-per-views per fight.

850
00:50:55,773 --> 00:50:59,844
Without me, WFA is just three
letters in the fucking alphabet.

851
00:51:04,916 --> 00:51:06,350
[chuckles]

852
00:51:06,383 --> 00:51:08,018
[chuckles]

853
00:51:08,352 --> 00:51:09,888
We're a little bigger than
that, Champ.

854
00:51:09,921 --> 00:51:11,021
Oh, yes? [chuckles]

855
00:51:11,054 --> 00:51:11,990
A little.

856
00:51:12,022 --> 00:51:13,892
[chuckles]

857
00:51:14,459 --> 00:51:19,898
But you are a very
important part of the family,

858
00:51:21,533 --> 00:51:23,100
very important.

859
00:51:23,133 --> 00:51:23,968
Thanks.

860
00:51:27,906 --> 00:51:30,475
What do you want, Cash?

861
00:51:30,942 --> 00:51:35,713
You gentlemen need to put together
a package, full insurance, benefits,

862
00:51:35,747 --> 00:51:38,883
pensions, higher revenue
sharing, upping the minimums.

863
00:51:38,917 --> 00:51:40,217
Cash.

864
00:51:40,250 --> 00:51:41,953
I better not want to wipe
my ass with it, Rami,

865
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:45,122
because we're this close
to organizing a union.

866
00:51:46,156 --> 00:51:49,928
I won't get every fighter to
join, but I'll get 40%.

867
00:51:50,962 --> 00:51:54,398
I'll establish an NLRB board.
We'll have elections.

868
00:51:55,132 --> 00:52:00,237
Oh, yes, baby.
It'll be quite the ass-fucking.

869
00:52:01,773 --> 00:52:02,774
Come on, David.

870
00:52:06,176 --> 00:52:12,917
[footsteps]

871
00:52:14,619 --> 00:52:16,754
You want me to put a little
smiling face emoji on it?

872
00:52:16,788 --> 00:52:19,457
Sure. [chuckles]

873
00:52:19,857 --> 00:52:20,959
Nice job.

874
00:52:22,326 --> 00:52:24,629
Okay, I have $20.

875
00:52:25,128 --> 00:52:28,633
With that $20, I decide
if I'm going to do this right,

876
00:52:28,666 --> 00:52:30,602
I need to get my breath fresh,"

877
00:52:31,168 --> 00:52:32,169
so I bought toothpaste.

878
00:52:32,537 --> 00:52:34,038
Toothpaste costs $4.75.

879
00:52:35,039 --> 00:52:36,774
I'm going to get a loaf
of bread because

880
00:52:36,808 --> 00:52:39,142
I need to make a sandwich when I get
home, preferably, I like salami.

881
00:52:39,176 --> 00:52:41,244
You know what I mean?
I don't know about you all.

882
00:52:41,278 --> 00:52:42,981
What's your favorite sandwich?

883
00:52:43,014 --> 00:52:44,147
Pepperoni sandwich.

884
00:52:44,181 --> 00:52:45,583
Oh, you love pepperoni
sandwich?

885
00:52:45,617 --> 00:52:47,018
That's some good pepperoni.

886
00:52:47,051 --> 00:52:48,251
All right,
let's get into the problem now.

887
00:52:48,285 --> 00:52:50,655
Here we go. $20, right?
Everybody see that?

888
00:52:51,221 --> 00:52:52,991
Yes.

889
00:52:53,024 --> 00:52:54,959
Okay, with that $20, I decide to
buy a toothpaste that costs $4.75.

890
00:52:54,993 --> 00:52:56,861
With that $4.75, I also decided,
"You know what?

891
00:52:56,894 --> 00:52:58,663
I'm going to buy some
bread that costs $3."

892
00:52:58,696 --> 00:53:00,297
How much change do I get back?

893
00:53:01,499 --> 00:53:02,265
Go ahead, Quinn.

894
00:53:02,299 --> 00:53:04,035
$12.25.

895
00:53:04,502 --> 00:53:09,974
That's right. $12.25.
My man. $12.25. [bell rings]

896
00:53:11,308 --> 00:53:12,710
Have a good day.

897
00:53:12,744 --> 00:53:15,379
I'll see you guys later.
Have a good day. Enjoy it.

898
00:53:15,412 --> 00:53:17,482
Get out in the sun.
Get some vitamin D.

899
00:53:17,515 --> 00:53:18,281
Killing it.

900
00:53:18,315 --> 00:53:19,383
Get some vitamin D, boy.

901
00:53:19,416 --> 00:53:20,051
[chuckles]

902
00:53:20,084 --> 00:53:21,451
I know. [chuckles]

903
00:53:21,486 --> 00:53:22,820
I'll come get you in a bit,
all right?

904
00:53:22,854 --> 00:53:24,187
Okay.

905
00:53:25,155 --> 00:53:26,824
You're a good dude, Mr.
Stewart.

906
00:53:26,858 --> 00:53:28,993
Thank you, Jett.
You're a good dude yourself.

907
00:53:29,527 --> 00:53:33,196
Hey, I have an old Army buddy
whose son wants to get into MMA.

908
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:35,298
Is there any chance
we could get coffee.

909
00:53:35,332 --> 00:53:36,734
Yes, of course. Anytime.

910
00:53:36,768 --> 00:53:39,003
Awesome. You're awesome for
that, thank you, man.

911
00:53:39,837 --> 00:53:41,338
Hey, do you know Keaton
Carmichael?

912
00:53:41,371 --> 00:53:44,042
I do know Keaton.
I wrote her a letter of commendation.

913
00:53:44,075 --> 00:53:45,308
Wait, you went to West Point?

914
00:53:45,342 --> 00:53:47,210
No, but after the Silver Star,

915
00:53:47,679 --> 00:53:50,114
I was fortunate enough
to meet Senator Cummings,

916
00:53:50,447 --> 00:53:54,418
and to get into West Point,
you need to be sponsored by a senator so.

917
00:53:54,451 --> 00:53:56,087
Moving and shaking, Mr.
Stewart.

918
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:57,555
Bam, bam. That's how I do it.

919
00:53:59,457 --> 00:54:00,458
Are you married?

920
00:54:00,892 --> 00:54:01,859
No.

921
00:54:01,893 --> 00:54:03,061
Girlfriend?

922
00:54:03,094 --> 00:54:04,261
You're starting to scare me.

923
00:54:04,294 --> 00:54:05,029
It's not for me.

924
00:54:05,063 --> 00:54:06,097
Okay.

925
00:54:06,130 --> 00:54:08,633
Okay?
I think I got somebody for you.

926
00:54:09,067 --> 00:54:12,704
Great, I haven't been
out on a date in a long time.

927
00:54:13,137 --> 00:54:14,371
Yes?

928
00:54:14,404 --> 00:54:16,074
I think everybody wants
to roll with you, man.

929
00:54:16,107 --> 00:54:20,912
Well, I do know how to roll.
[laughter]

930
00:54:20,945 --> 00:54:22,046
You know what I'm saying?

931
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:24,082
I don't mean to sound shallow,
but...

932
00:54:24,115 --> 00:54:25,049
Don't say it, mom.

933
00:54:25,083 --> 00:54:26,050
He's in a wheelchair.

934
00:54:27,217 --> 00:54:28,251
Yes, that's what happens when
brave

935
00:54:28,285 --> 00:54:30,121
men go out to war and get shot,
mother.

936
00:54:30,154 --> 00:54:33,091
He's good-looking, he's great with
Quinn, his penis still works.

937
00:54:33,124 --> 00:54:34,257
[chuckles]

938
00:54:34,291 --> 00:54:36,928
Tell me you did not
ask about his penis.

939
00:54:36,961 --> 00:54:38,295
Of course I did.

940
00:54:38,328 --> 00:54:39,697
You think I want my mom
hanging with some flat tire?

941
00:54:39,731 --> 00:54:41,298
[chuckles]

942
00:54:41,331 --> 00:54:42,700
Jett William Boykins, tell me
you didn't ask about his penis.

943
00:54:42,734 --> 00:54:44,068
[chuckles] Penis.

944
00:54:44,102 --> 00:54:46,137
[chuckles] No, I didn't.
I had Derril ask him.

945
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:47,138
He was subtle about it.

946
00:54:47,171 --> 00:54:48,906
Oh, sure.

947
00:54:51,976 --> 00:54:57,347
One, two, three,

948
00:54:59,117 --> 00:55:02,553
four, four, five.

949
00:55:02,587 --> 00:55:05,422
[chuckles] This might be the
worse pushups I've ever seen.

950
00:55:05,757 --> 00:55:07,925
Well, yes. I learned it from
you.

951
00:55:07,959 --> 00:55:09,961
Yes? Well,
you bend these little arms [?].

952
00:55:09,994 --> 00:55:11,162
Let go of your hand.

953
00:55:11,195 --> 00:55:12,096
What are you going to do?

954
00:55:12,130 --> 00:55:13,363
I'll kick your freaking ass.

955
00:55:14,632 --> 00:55:18,536
Mom, help. Ow. Ow.

956
00:55:21,038 --> 00:55:23,107
Damn. Where has this been?

957
00:55:25,009 --> 00:55:26,978
I heard Mr. Stewart's stacked.

958
00:55:28,846 --> 00:55:30,347
Kampai.

959
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:32,150
Kampai.

960
00:55:32,183 --> 00:55:33,184
To a great mom.

961
00:55:34,852 --> 00:55:36,220
I don't know about that.

962
00:55:36,554 --> 00:55:38,556
Come on, Susan. Just say thank
you.

963
00:55:39,190 --> 00:55:39,924
Thank you.

964
00:55:39,957 --> 00:55:42,126
[laughs] Yes.

965
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:45,797
I feel like single moms with special
needs kids have it the hardest.

966
00:55:45,830 --> 00:55:47,131
It's been quite a ride.

967
00:55:47,465 --> 00:55:49,000
Yes, I know.

968
00:55:51,401 --> 00:55:52,136
Yes?

969
00:55:52,170 --> 00:55:53,204
Yes.

970
00:55:53,971 --> 00:55:55,206
How much do you know?

971
00:55:57,475 --> 00:55:59,744
I know everything. It's my job
to.

972
00:56:02,379 --> 00:56:05,483
Has Quinn ever
talked to you about it?

973
00:56:07,417 --> 00:56:11,889
No. I mean, honestly,
I don't think he remembers.

974
00:56:13,191 --> 00:56:14,826
Do you have discussed it with
Jett?

975
00:56:14,859 --> 00:56:20,565
Tidbits here and there.
He doesn't remember the big stuff.

976
00:56:24,669 --> 00:56:28,506
You know when Jett-

977
00:56:30,208 --> 00:56:31,374
-Set us up?

978
00:56:31,408 --> 00:56:34,178
Yes. When he set us
up, I googled you.

979
00:56:34,512 --> 00:56:36,214
No.

980
00:56:36,247 --> 00:56:41,586
Yes. [laughs] I totally did.
You were a top-ranked tennis player.

981
00:56:42,419 --> 00:56:44,255
Hard to believe, right?
Look at me now.

982
00:56:44,288 --> 00:56:47,258
What are you talking about?
You look amazing. You do.

983
00:56:47,291 --> 00:56:49,193
Thank you.

984
00:56:54,298 --> 00:56:57,235
You are grounded, young lady.

Hey, no excuses. Pee in this

987
00:57:00,872 --> 00:57:06,077
No phone for a week. So?

988
00:57:11,381 --> 00:57:14,051
It was nice. Thank you.

Are you afraid of flying?

No, I really enjoy it. I get

Stand there. Put your hands up.

No. What are you doing?

01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:58,516
Yes, I know. Come in.
We've been here ever since it went viral.

1060
01:04:59,883 --> 01:05:03,755
You have vocab on Wednesday
and biology's on Friday

1061
01:05:04,288 --> 01:05:06,725
and your written
assignment is in this folder.

1062
01:05:07,525 --> 01:05:08,793
It's pretty self-explanatory.

1063
01:05:09,561 --> 01:05:10,562
Thank you.

1064
01:05:12,029 --> 01:05:13,230
Where did he come from?

1065
01:05:14,298 --> 01:05:17,535
He just crashed.
He was up all night.

1066
01:05:17,802 --> 01:05:20,739
All the online stuff sent
his anxiety through the roof.

1067
01:05:21,639 --> 01:05:25,710
He's so sweet. I just love him.
I'd kill for those lips.

1068
01:05:26,043 --> 01:05:27,411
The hair is what gets me.

1069
01:05:29,213 --> 01:05:30,782
I've tried every gel known to man
and still can't figure it out.

1070
01:05:31,382 --> 01:05:32,383
Welcome to Holland.

1071
01:05:33,450 --> 01:05:34,652
What?

1072
01:05:36,053 --> 01:05:38,790
Welcome to Holland, the poem.
You have to read it.

1073
01:05:39,758 --> 01:05:43,595
It was written by a mother whose son
has Down's, I'm paraphrasing here.

1074
01:05:44,928 --> 01:05:46,897
When a woman is getting
ready to have a baby,

1075
01:05:46,930 --> 01:05:50,267
it's like planning a trip to Italy.
She was excited.

1076
01:05:50,602 --> 01:05:55,807
She buys six guidebooks and plans a
trip to the Vatican, the Colosseum,

1077
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:56,841
a winery in Florence.

1078
01:05:58,510 --> 01:06:01,746
When she arrives, the pilot
says, "Welcome to Holland."

1079
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:05,550
She's like, "Holland?
No, no, I signed up for Italy.

1080
01:06:05,583 --> 01:06:07,951
There's no way in hell
I'm staying in Holland."

1081
01:06:07,985 --> 01:06:11,790
But she has no choice,
that's where she landed.

1082
01:06:14,425 --> 01:06:17,862
She learns Dutch
and she buys new guidebooks.

1083
01:06:19,597 --> 01:06:23,167
She visits the windmills
and sees a few Rembrandts.

1084
01:06:24,636 --> 01:06:27,839
All the while, all her friends
are just living it up in Italy,

1085
01:06:28,172 --> 01:06:29,808
bragging about how great it is.

1086
01:06:32,877 --> 01:06:36,113
She realizes that
she can't let it get to her.

1087
01:06:37,948 --> 01:06:41,985
She can't spend time mourning
over Italy because then she'll

1088
01:06:42,953 --> 01:06:45,657
never be free to appreciate
the true beauty of Holland.

1089
01:06:53,130 --> 01:06:56,634
I'm not sure if I love
that poem or despise it.

1090
01:06:57,301 --> 01:07:00,370
Yes, me neither. I appreciate
it.

1091
01:07:03,207 --> 01:07:07,846
I appreciate you.
Thank you, Keaton.

1092
01:07:09,079 --> 01:07:10,080
I mean it.

1093
01:07:10,882 --> 01:07:13,885
You're welcome, Jett, I mean
it.

1094
01:07:27,932 --> 01:07:32,770
Look, Cash, I don't know
who leaked it and I don't care.

1095
01:07:33,070 --> 01:07:34,739
You don't know who leaked it.

1096
01:07:35,072 --> 01:07:37,107
You must think I'm fucking
stupid, Rami.

1097
01:07:39,777 --> 01:07:42,179
You don't think I know what
goes on in my own camp?

1098
01:07:43,046 --> 01:07:44,582
I just follow the numbers.

1099
01:07:45,082 --> 01:07:48,720
As do I, which is why I thanked
the bitch before I fired her.

1100
01:07:50,688 --> 01:07:51,956
Let's talk cabbage.

1101
01:07:54,291 --> 01:07:55,292
Okay.

1102
01:07:58,095 --> 01:08:03,200
50 million upfront, guaranteed.

1103
01:08:04,969 --> 01:08:08,138
What are we looking at?
Five million pay-per-views, six?

1104
01:08:09,306 --> 01:08:11,976
Jamie is probably still
jerking off to YouTube.

1105
01:08:12,477 --> 01:08:13,811
I can't pull it out.

1106
01:08:15,914 --> 01:08:16,915
The catch, Rami?

1107
01:08:18,148 --> 01:08:20,150
The catch is you drop
this union nonsense,

1108
01:08:21,084 --> 01:08:22,720
pensions, healthcare, all that.

1109
01:08:22,754 --> 01:08:23,755
Forget it.

1110
01:08:25,289 --> 01:08:27,559
Come on, Cash, you honestly
want to spend the next 10 years

1111
01:08:27,592 --> 01:08:30,327
of your life in court flying
back and forth to LA.

1112
01:08:32,630 --> 01:08:37,301
I will never allow a union,
not now, not ever.

1113
01:08:54,018 --> 01:08:55,653
I only want five million
upfront.

1114
01:08:57,455 --> 01:09:00,157
If word ever leaked out to my fanbase
that I was guaranteed 50 mils,

1115
01:09:01,425 --> 01:09:04,261
25% wouldn't buy the fight
out of principle alone.

1116
01:09:05,997 --> 01:09:08,866
I want half of everything else.

1117
01:09:11,803 --> 01:09:13,504
You're insane.

1118
01:09:13,538 --> 01:09:16,440
You're asking me to fight my own
son, you fucking goat roper.

1119
01:09:17,341 --> 01:09:21,045
Half the gate, half the
merchandise, half all pay per view,

1120
01:09:21,613 --> 01:09:28,019
and access to the books. That's
the deal, decide now. Yes or no?

1121
01:09:33,024 --> 01:09:34,025
Up to you, pal.

1122
01:09:39,162 --> 01:09:40,865
Keep smiling, Rami.

1123
01:09:49,807 --> 01:09:51,576
Please tell me
you're not doing this.

1124
01:09:52,677 --> 01:09:53,377
Doing what?

1125
01:09:53,410 --> 01:09:54,679
Fighting Jett.

1126
01:10:01,385 --> 01:10:02,452
I'm done.

1127
01:10:02,487 --> 01:10:03,721
What?

1128
01:10:03,755 --> 01:10:05,188
I'm so fucking done with you.
I'm done.

1129
01:10:05,222 --> 01:10:06,057
How are you done, Jade?

1130
01:10:06,090 --> 01:10:07,458
He's your son, Cash.

1131
01:10:07,492 --> 01:10:10,895
Hey, how are you done?
Divorce done?

1132
01:10:11,261 --> 01:10:13,865
You better fucking answer me.
How are you done?

1133
01:10:13,898 --> 01:10:15,298
Cash, you're hurting me.

1134
01:10:15,332 --> 01:10:17,535
This will be the last fucking
mistake you ever made.

1135
01:10:19,236 --> 01:10:20,638
Are you threatening me?

1136
01:10:20,672 --> 01:10:22,707
Oh, it's not a threat, baby.
It's a fact.

1137
01:10:24,676 --> 01:10:27,111
If you're smart,
you'll learn the fucking difference.

1138
01:10:34,251 --> 01:10:35,053
I'm sorry.

1139
01:10:40,257 --> 01:10:43,127
He offered us half,
baby, of everything.

1140
01:10:44,729 --> 01:10:51,636
We'll make $100 million on this
fight alone, maybe even $200. Jade.

1141
01:10:56,306 --> 01:10:59,242
Good evening. Welcome to the
Yard.

1142
01:10:59,276 --> 01:11:01,278
We've got some great specials
today.

1143
01:11:01,311 --> 01:11:02,480
Hello, Susan.

1144
01:11:07,151 --> 01:11:08,786
Hey.

1145
01:11:24,502 --> 01:11:26,170
You've been offered another
fight.

1146
01:11:28,906 --> 01:11:32,309
Child Services should lock me up
for even mentioning this to you.

1147
01:11:32,342 --> 01:11:33,111
Tell me.

1148
01:11:37,347 --> 01:11:39,249
Boykins versus Boykins.

1149
01:11:42,487 --> 01:11:43,588
God.

1150
01:11:45,189 --> 01:11:46,190
How much?

1151
01:11:47,024 --> 01:11:48,126
$200,000.

1152
01:11:48,159 --> 01:11:51,462
Holy crap. Did he agree to it?

1153
01:11:51,496 --> 01:11:52,630
You can't do this.

1154
01:11:52,663 --> 01:11:53,965
What do you mean?
Of course, I can do it.

1155
01:11:53,998 --> 01:11:55,398
I can't in good conscience.

1156
01:11:55,432 --> 01:11:57,168
Look, mom.
I'm 18, I can do whatever I want.

1157
01:11:57,201 --> 01:12:00,138
Jett, you're not thinking
about the ramifications.

1158
01:12:00,171 --> 01:12:01,172
It's $200,000, mom.

1159
01:12:01,205 --> 01:12:02,974
He can kill you, baby.

1160
01:12:03,007 --> 01:12:03,674
Stop.

1161
01:12:03,708 --> 01:12:05,408
I know him too well.

1162
01:12:05,442 --> 01:12:08,746
After that video and all the
shit he's taken on social media,

1163
01:12:08,780 --> 01:12:09,947
he wants to kill you.

1164
01:12:09,981 --> 01:12:11,314
Mom, I'm his son.

1165
01:12:11,348 --> 01:12:15,119
He's a psychopath.
Please, sweetheart, for me.

1166
01:12:16,353 --> 01:12:21,125
Just give yourself one more year.
I mean, you are a child.

1167
01:12:21,459 --> 01:12:24,128
There will be other opportunities
like this. I promise you.

1168
01:12:24,162 --> 01:12:25,029
What if there's none?

1169
01:12:25,062 --> 01:12:26,329
Then this wasn't meant to be-

1170
01:12:26,363 --> 01:12:27,031
-No-

1171
01:12:27,064 --> 01:12:27,598
...in the first place.

1172
01:12:27,632 --> 01:12:29,299
...no, no. Fuck.

1173
01:12:29,332 --> 01:12:30,535
Please don't do this.

1174
01:12:30,568 --> 01:12:32,670
No. This isn't about you, mom.

1175
01:12:33,738 --> 01:12:36,406
It's not about
you and it's not about Quinn.

1176
01:12:37,542 --> 01:12:39,744
For once, it's about me.

1177
01:12:50,855 --> 01:12:52,490
I didn't think I'd see you
again.

1178
01:12:54,258 --> 01:12:55,193
That makes two of us.

1179
01:12:56,426 --> 01:12:57,795
I bet your head is
spinning in a hundred

1180
01:12:57,829 --> 01:12:59,564
different directions
right about now.

1181
01:13:00,064 --> 01:13:01,265
Yes.

1182
01:13:03,034 --> 01:13:04,836
I was just listening to a guy on a
podcast, he called you insane.

1183
01:13:05,570 --> 01:13:06,838
He's got me pegged.

1184
01:13:12,076 --> 01:13:14,846
I'm here because I wanted
to thank you, Ms. Malek,

1185
01:13:16,013 --> 01:13:19,717
and all my teachers who've
bent over backward for me.

1186
01:13:22,419 --> 01:13:24,222
That's what makes this so hard.

1187
01:13:26,290 --> 01:13:29,193
I really want to graduate
and someday go to college,

1188
01:13:29,227 --> 01:13:32,997
but I don't know how
to make it all work right now.

1189
01:13:33,030 --> 01:13:34,699
Don't drop out, Jett.

1190
01:13:36,033 --> 01:13:37,602
I'm missing my semester finals.

1191
01:13:38,269 --> 01:13:39,604
Take them after you win.

1192
01:13:45,276 --> 01:13:47,011
Look, I'll take care of the
powers that be on this end.

1193
01:13:47,044 --> 01:13:50,248
You just take care
of business on yours. Good?

1194
01:13:51,381 --> 01:13:52,750
Thank you.

1195
01:13:53,918 --> 01:13:56,287
You know all the great
mathematicians were insane?

1196
01:13:59,156 --> 01:14:00,892
Maybe that's how you approach
this.

1197
01:14:02,392 --> 01:14:04,829
You have one very difficult
problem in front of you.

1198
01:14:05,930 --> 01:14:06,931
Solve it.

1199
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:16,240
[phone ringing]

1200
01:14:22,914 --> 01:14:24,248
Hey, grab a pen and paper.

1201
01:14:25,116 --> 01:14:26,183
Yes, I'm ready.

1202
01:14:26,751 --> 01:14:32,490
429241017.

1203
01:14:33,157 --> 01:14:34,424
Who am I calling?

1204
01:14:36,794 --> 01:14:38,195
That's a closed number.

1205
01:14:38,496 --> 01:14:40,264
The only one who
will beat you there.

1206
01:14:41,532 --> 01:14:42,934
I'll see you in Vegas.

1207
01:14:49,607 --> 01:14:52,143
Motherfucking Kareef hooked it
up, baby.

1208
01:14:52,877 --> 01:14:54,412
Lovely guy.

1209
01:14:54,444 --> 01:15:01,385
[music]

1210
01:16:21,432 --> 01:16:22,600
Jett.

1211
01:16:22,633 --> 01:16:23,567
[?].

1212
01:16:23,601 --> 01:16:25,369
You're joking, right? Claude.

1213
01:16:25,403 --> 01:16:26,871
Truly.

1214
01:16:26,904 --> 01:16:29,240
No, no, no. I'm a hugger.
You better get used to it.

1215
01:16:30,441 --> 01:16:31,609
You're hungry?

1216
01:16:31,642 --> 01:16:33,077
Yes.

1217
01:16:33,110 --> 01:16:34,111
All right, come inside
and we'll get you set up.

1218
01:16:34,145 --> 01:16:34,678
Let me help you, give me your
bag.

1219
01:16:34,712 --> 01:16:35,780
Thanks.

1220
01:16:35,813 --> 01:16:39,316
This way.
Give me your phone, please.

1221
01:16:44,789 --> 01:16:48,893
You'll see it in one month.
This way. Voila.

1222
01:16:51,796 --> 01:16:52,963
Smells good.

1223
01:16:52,997 --> 01:16:53,631
Nice.

1224
01:16:53,664 --> 01:16:54,665
Bon appetit, guys.

1225
01:16:57,334 --> 01:16:58,335
Are you scared?

1226
01:17:04,341 --> 01:17:05,342
Yes.

1227
01:17:07,479 --> 01:17:09,413
For two decades now,

1228
01:17:09,447 --> 01:17:12,817
Cash Boykins has been one of the most
polarizing athletes in all of sports.

1229
01:17:12,850 --> 01:17:14,985
He's not a modern-day
slice of Americana.

1230
01:17:15,019 --> 01:17:18,055
He's the whole pie. Why this
fight?

1231
01:17:18,089 --> 01:17:21,092
Why your own son? For the money?

1232
01:17:21,526 --> 01:17:23,027
Revenge for that post?

1233
01:17:25,329 --> 01:17:26,964
Or does it go even deeper?

1234
01:17:27,631 --> 01:17:31,470
Look, Jett has a lot of talent
and he's got a bright future.

1235
01:17:32,537 --> 01:17:35,272
But he won't improve
unless he fights the best.

1236
01:17:36,541 --> 01:17:39,544
Unfortunately, that's me.

1237
01:17:40,311 --> 01:17:43,380
The Apocalypse is finally upon
us.

1238
01:17:43,714 --> 01:17:46,650
We are just a few weeks
away from what promises

1239
01:17:46,684 --> 01:17:50,489
to be the most controversial
fight in WFA history,

1240
01:17:50,522 --> 01:17:54,859
between Cash Boykins
and his 18-year-old son Jett.

1241
01:17:54,892 --> 01:17:56,461
How about that, partner?

1242
01:17:56,495 --> 01:17:58,696
Syd, honestly, I believe
we've officially reached a new

1243
01:17:58,729 --> 01:18:00,865
low in this great
country you call America.

1244
01:18:01,365 --> 01:18:03,134
I don't care how much money
he's-

1245
01:18:03,167 --> 01:18:06,137
- You don't care about how much
money, what planet are you from?

1246
01:18:06,170 --> 01:18:09,707
Fathers don't fight sons under
any circumstance. This is family.

1247
01:18:09,740 --> 01:18:12,843
Family who don't much
like each other right now.

1248
01:18:12,877 --> 01:18:16,515
Here's the deal, the fight
game is all about the Benjamins.

1249
01:18:16,548 --> 01:18:17,181
Sure.

1250
01:18:17,214 --> 01:18:18,449
It's about money.

1251
01:18:18,483 --> 01:18:21,752
If there is a specific demand,
you go after it.

1252
01:18:22,554 --> 01:18:25,122
Jett's fight against Promotico,
did you even watch it?

1253
01:18:25,156 --> 01:18:26,957
I did. I did. Thank you, Syd.

1254
01:18:26,991 --> 01:18:30,562
Yes, but Tricky Ricky Promotico ain't
Liquid Cash Boykins, the Slayer.

1255
01:18:30,595 --> 01:18:34,064
Cash is the greatest fighter
in the history of the sport

1256
01:18:34,098 --> 01:18:37,668
and this boy has a zero percent
chance of beating the king.

1257
01:18:37,701 --> 01:18:40,539
Zero percent would
mean there's zero appeal,

1258
01:18:40,572 --> 01:18:43,741
which means there would
be zero reason to do this fight.

1259
01:18:44,041 --> 01:18:46,043
That's not the case. Keep in
mind.

1260
01:18:46,545 --> 01:18:49,813
Cash's fight against
Evil Fate the Terrible

1261
01:18:49,847 --> 01:18:54,519
did about $2.7 million
buys at $79.95 a buy.

1262
01:18:54,553 --> 01:18:59,423
Now they're estimating that this
bet will do over $6 million buys,

1263
01:18:59,790 --> 01:19:03,227
at $89.95 a pop. Benjamins,
baby.

1264
01:19:03,260 --> 01:19:06,096
Yes, Syd, I think you've had a few
too many tokes of Colorado's finest.

1265
01:19:06,130 --> 01:19:07,898
Not this morning.

1266
01:19:07,932 --> 01:19:10,768
I will tell you this, every high
school kid will not ask their parents,

1267
01:19:10,801 --> 01:19:14,038
they will demand that
their parents buy this fight.

1268
01:19:14,071 --> 01:19:18,610
The video has already gone
viral. 50 million views.

1269
01:19:18,876 --> 01:19:25,550
Jamie, about that 200 grand,
add a zero.

1270
01:19:33,057 --> 01:19:34,225
You be good for mom.

1271
01:19:39,497 --> 01:19:40,498
I love you, buddy.

1272
01:19:40,764 --> 01:19:42,132
I love you, too.

1273
01:19:42,166 --> 01:19:43,167
Come here.

1274
01:19:51,408 --> 01:19:52,611
I'll be back Sunday morning.

1275
01:19:57,616 --> 01:19:58,583
Will you still be here?

1276
01:20:00,685 --> 01:20:01,686
Come on, Jade.

1277
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:06,123
Cash, I warned you
before we got married.

1278
01:20:06,991 --> 01:20:08,693
Zero tolerance.

1279
01:20:10,327 --> 01:20:11,295
We had a contract.

1280
01:20:12,830 --> 01:20:15,132
I know. I'm sorry, babe.

1281
01:20:16,934 --> 01:20:19,671
Me too. Kareef?

1282
01:20:20,639 --> 01:20:21,640
Hey, Jade.

1283
01:20:22,273 --> 01:20:23,807
How you doing, little man?

1284
01:20:23,841 --> 01:20:24,842
Kareef.

1285
01:20:28,045 --> 01:20:30,715
Just wait until I get back,
please.

1286
01:20:32,484 --> 01:20:33,485
I love you.

1287
01:20:47,064 --> 01:20:48,132
See you guys.

1288
01:21:00,344 --> 01:21:07,351
[music]

1289
01:21:34,411 --> 01:21:35,879
What was it like to beat Cash?

1290
01:21:38,082 --> 01:21:39,584
Do you really want to know?

1291
01:21:40,719 --> 01:21:41,952
Yes.

1292
01:21:45,790 --> 01:21:48,892
You're going to find
out soon because

1293
01:21:48,926 --> 01:21:51,128
you're going to beat this guy,
right?

1294
01:21:52,963 --> 01:21:56,568
You must fight smarter,
take emotion out of it, stick to the plan,

1295
01:21:56,601 --> 01:21:57,935
and you will outwit him.

1296
01:21:57,968 --> 01:21:59,103
Yes?

1297
01:21:59,571 --> 01:22:00,572
Yes.

1298
01:22:19,591 --> 01:22:21,793
Hey, is it true the Rock's
coming tomorrow night?

1299
01:22:21,826 --> 01:22:24,928
That'd be sweet.
Any of you guys seen Skyscraper?

1300
01:22:24,962 --> 01:22:27,799
That is a fucking masterpiece
man.

1301
01:22:27,832 --> 01:22:29,933
Feeling good, Cash?

1302
01:22:29,967 --> 01:22:32,936
My balls are in this robe,
big time.

1303
01:22:32,970 --> 01:22:34,972
Cash, do you feel any
remorse for fighting your son?

1304
01:22:35,005 --> 01:22:38,142
Shit no. Every 18-year-old
kid out there deserves

1305
01:22:38,175 --> 01:22:41,412
a good old fashioned ass whooping.
It builds character.

1306
01:22:41,679 --> 01:22:44,214
He's been saying that exact same
line to me since I was three.

1307
01:22:44,248 --> 01:22:46,417
Cash,
the way you're talking to him,

1308
01:22:46,450 --> 01:22:48,820
the fact that you're already
drinking, it only reaffirms-

1309
01:22:48,853 --> 01:22:50,588
- You know what it reaffirms,
honey?

1310
01:22:50,822 --> 01:22:54,258
It reaffirms that I could really
use a handjob right about now.

1311
01:22:54,291 --> 01:22:55,827
Cash, that's sexual harassment.

1312
01:22:56,427 --> 01:22:58,496
Lick me where I shit, Jamie.

1313
01:22:58,929 --> 01:22:59,997
[laughs]

1314
01:23:00,030 --> 01:23:01,932
Now that's sexual harassment,
people.

1315
01:23:01,965 --> 01:23:05,703
Hey, in his defense,
the abuse stuff was 10 years ago.

1316
01:23:06,303 --> 01:23:07,371
He paid his dues.

1317
01:23:09,273 --> 01:23:10,274
That doesn't change the fact that
he's an absolute piece of crap,

1318
01:23:10,307 --> 01:23:11,476
so you can feel free to sue his
ass.

1319
01:23:11,509 --> 01:23:13,410
My baby is so sweet, ain't he?

1320
01:23:13,444 --> 01:23:14,813
You won't be thinking
that tomorrow night.

1321
01:23:14,846 --> 01:23:15,979
I can guarantee you that.

1322
01:23:20,852 --> 01:23:22,921
Is Sport going
to give me a licking?

1323
01:23:22,953 --> 01:23:25,590
I could have knocked your sorry
ass out four months ago, chief.

1324
01:23:25,623 --> 01:23:26,990
I don't remember
it going down like that.

1325
01:23:27,024 --> 01:23:28,992
Yes, you don't remember
yesterday.

1326
01:23:29,026 --> 01:23:30,027
This is true.

1327
01:23:31,463 --> 01:23:33,997
Hey, barkeep, get this guy
another Bloody Mary.

1328
01:23:34,031 --> 01:23:36,300
Good idea, Barkeep.
Make it a double.

1329
01:23:38,470 --> 01:23:39,471
Next?

1330
01:23:39,504 --> 01:23:41,305
Come on. Daddy needs shoes.

1331
01:23:43,842 --> 01:23:45,442
No, you won. We won. Yes, go
ahead.

1332
01:23:45,477 --> 01:23:49,213
Take it out. Let me get it.
On a four, on a five, on a six,

1333
01:23:49,514 --> 01:23:52,049
on an eight and throw
all these the hard way,

1334
01:23:52,851 --> 01:23:53,885
Oh boy.

1335
01:23:54,919 --> 01:23:56,420
What the fuck is this?

1336
01:23:56,888 --> 01:23:57,889
Shit.

1337
01:23:57,922 --> 01:23:58,690
Sir, could you please?

1338
01:23:58,723 --> 01:24:02,760
Shit. Sorry, baby. Wow.

1339
01:24:03,227 --> 01:24:08,933
Now, this is some great shit we
got going on in here baby. Right?

1340
01:24:11,903 --> 01:24:13,036
I'm Cash.

1341
01:24:13,070 --> 01:24:15,038
Hi, Cash.
How are you doing? I'm Dan.

1342
01:24:15,072 --> 01:24:16,541
Dan? Tell me, Dan.

1343
01:24:17,274 --> 01:24:20,110
How is it you can see the dice
from all the way down there?

1344
01:24:22,112 --> 01:24:25,048
Cash, go to bed.

1345
01:24:26,016 --> 01:24:29,721
Hey, look at all these
little cute $25 chips, Susie.

1346
01:24:30,588 --> 01:24:33,458
You two want a few bananas?

1347
01:24:33,925 --> 01:24:38,730
I only got about 50 left, but hell,
they ain't doing me any fucking good.

1348
01:24:38,763 --> 01:24:40,264
[laughs]

1349
01:24:41,131 --> 01:24:43,100
I think you might
need those for later.

1350
01:24:43,801 --> 01:24:49,941
What? Hey, you got that right.
I do need these.

1351
01:24:52,276 --> 01:24:53,410
Do you want to help me out?

1352
01:24:53,443 --> 01:24:55,112
Because I'm good
but I ain't that good.

1353
01:24:57,214 --> 01:24:58,983
Come here.
Let me tell you something.

1354
01:25:10,160 --> 01:25:13,932
Then she went down on [?].
[laughter]

1355
01:25:14,431 --> 01:25:18,201
Do you believe this?
I liked it. He's good.

1356
01:25:18,235 --> 01:25:20,605
He's okay,
whatever the hell your name is.

1357
01:25:20,638 --> 01:25:21,271
Dan.

1358
01:25:21,305 --> 01:25:24,809
Dan. Oh, cool, man.

1359
01:25:27,177 --> 01:25:30,247
Do you need a ticket or something
for tomorrow night's battle?

1360
01:25:35,787 --> 01:25:37,522
What the fuck
you know about battle?

1361
01:25:54,371 --> 01:25:55,372
Hey, Jett.

1362
01:25:55,807 --> 01:25:56,808
Yes?

1363
01:25:56,841 --> 01:25:58,776
Is "Screw you" bad?

1364
01:26:00,377 --> 01:26:01,378
Yes.

1365
01:26:06,183 --> 01:26:09,554
What about "Anal"?

1366
01:26:10,120 --> 01:26:15,158
[laughs] Very bad.

1367
01:26:18,161 --> 01:26:19,196
Have a dessert.

1368
01:26:19,998 --> 01:26:21,032
Heck, yes.

1369
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:25,970
Wait, what about my diet?

1370
01:26:26,004 --> 01:26:27,005
No rules tonight.

1371
01:26:28,506 --> 01:26:29,674
All right, you can have as
much dying sugar as you want,

1372
01:26:29,707 --> 01:26:31,009
or you can be up late. Okay?

1373
01:26:31,042 --> 01:26:32,010
Okay.

1374
01:26:32,043 --> 01:26:34,177
We won't fight till 10 o'clock.

1375
01:26:34,211 --> 01:26:37,515
My body peaks at 12,
so I need to sleep late, understand?

1376
01:26:39,383 --> 01:26:42,152
I want two chocolate sundaes
with whipped cream and Skittles.

1377
01:26:42,185 --> 01:26:43,186
Yes.

1378
01:26:50,227 --> 01:26:57,167
[phone ringing]

1379
01:27:09,914 --> 01:27:11,082
This is [?].

1380
01:27:11,916 --> 01:27:13,350
Ever heard of a neck crank?

1381
01:27:17,055 --> 01:27:18,056
I have not.

1382
01:27:19,557 --> 01:27:21,826
It's the closest thing
one human being can

1383
01:27:21,859 --> 01:27:25,029
do to another before
ripping his head off.

1384
01:27:27,732 --> 01:27:28,733
Sounds fun.

1385
01:27:29,967 --> 01:27:31,301
You're looking for some fun?

1386
01:27:32,202 --> 01:27:34,072
Come on up
to the Presidential Suite.

1387
01:27:37,307 --> 01:27:38,576
Jade not making this trip?

1388
01:27:42,146 --> 01:27:44,048
I think she's leaving me,
sport.

1389
01:27:45,083 --> 01:27:48,285
Oh, good for her.

1390
01:27:52,590 --> 01:27:56,226
It won't last. She will be
back.

1391
01:27:57,995 --> 01:27:58,996
Don't bet on it.

1392
01:28:01,766 --> 01:28:03,901
[sighs]

1393
01:28:07,739 --> 01:28:10,074
What's Claude's
grand plan this time?

1394
01:28:12,309 --> 01:28:16,180
I can see you two
butt-fuckers now watching film,

1395
01:28:16,781 --> 01:28:19,951
sipping on some Bordeaux,
talking socialism.

1396
01:28:20,818 --> 01:28:22,319
[laughs]

1397
01:28:22,954 --> 01:28:25,089
I'm just glad I finally
figured out the truth.

1398
01:28:27,125 --> 01:28:29,494
The truth, huh, and what's
that?

1399
01:28:31,829 --> 01:28:33,698
That you're just
a really weak person.

1400
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:42,540
You're weak when it comes to Jade,
pathetic when it comes to Quinn, mom,

1401
01:28:45,342 --> 01:28:47,512
but maybe your biggest
weakness is yourself.

1402
01:28:50,347 --> 01:28:53,450
I pray I never end up like you.

1403
01:28:54,652 --> 01:28:55,653
You won't.

1404
01:28:57,155 --> 01:28:58,156
Know how I know that?

1405
01:29:01,358 --> 01:29:03,461
Because tomorrow night you die,
Sport.

1406
01:29:05,563 --> 01:29:08,633
Tomorrow night, I kill you.

1407
01:29:12,236 --> 01:29:19,243
[music]

1408
01:29:53,611 --> 01:29:54,612
Okay.

1409
01:30:15,867 --> 01:30:18,236
[?], kid.

1410
01:31:04,181 --> 01:31:10,054
Also fighting out of Birmingham with
a record of 38 wins, one defeat,

1411
01:31:10,087 --> 01:31:13,257
the undisputed Lightweight
Champion of the world,

1412
01:31:13,291 --> 01:31:18,296
the undisputed Welterweight
Champion of the world, the Slayer,

1413
01:31:18,329 --> 01:31:23,334
Liquid Cash Boykins.

1414
01:31:23,367 --> 01:31:25,469
[crowd cheers]

1415
01:31:25,503 --> 01:31:26,470
Come on, Jett.

1416
01:31:30,007 --> 01:31:31,208
How are we doing?

1417
01:31:31,876 --> 01:31:34,412
Shake up a little, Jett. Shake
up.

1418
01:31:34,478 --> 01:31:38,082
[crowd cheers]

1419
01:31:38,115 --> 01:31:41,285
All right, guys, bring it in.
Bring it in, gentlemen.

1420
01:31:41,319 --> 01:31:43,955
Gentlemen, championship fight here.
You both know the rules.

1421
01:31:43,988 --> 01:31:46,390
If you want to touch gloves,
go ahead and do so now.

1422
01:31:47,391 --> 01:31:49,327
All right then, go back to your corners.
Come out on my call.

1423
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:51,329
Cash, quick question.

1424
01:31:51,629 --> 01:31:54,532
My daughter is just done with karate.
Can she be next?

1425
01:31:54,565 --> 01:31:57,868
[laughs] [crowd cheers]

1426
01:31:57,902 --> 01:31:59,503
Go back to your corner.

1427
01:31:59,537 --> 01:32:06,243
[crowd cheers] [applause]

1428
01:32:06,978 --> 01:32:08,379
Are you ready to go?

1429
01:32:09,180 --> 01:32:11,716
Cash, are you ready to go?
Let's fight. [bell rings]

1430
01:32:11,749 --> 01:32:13,784
Here we go, Kenny.
Father versus son.

1431
01:32:13,818 --> 01:32:15,720
Man, you could feel
the tension right now.

1432
01:32:15,753 --> 01:32:19,023
Cash comes out strong,
looking for that spinning back kick.

1433
01:32:19,056 --> 01:32:20,591
He's trying to take his head
off.

1434
01:32:22,426 --> 01:32:25,363
Now attacking the body,
trying to slow down Jett.

1435
01:32:25,396 --> 01:32:26,897
Smart strategy.

1436
01:32:26,931 --> 01:32:28,799
Jett needs to use his distance.
That's what he does best.

1437
01:32:28,833 --> 01:32:32,236
It's hard to do it against an
aggressive fighter like Cash though.

1438
01:32:38,209 --> 01:32:41,078
Looking to counter. Nice front
kick.

1439
01:32:48,085 --> 01:32:51,422
The son hits the floor.
He just hit him in the face. Same corner.

1440
01:32:52,690 --> 01:32:53,858
What the fuck are you doing?

1441
01:32:53,891 --> 01:32:55,526
Jett trying to go to the
ground.

1442
01:32:55,559 --> 01:32:57,995
Come on. Get up.

1443
01:32:58,029 --> 01:32:59,063
Cash is not having it.

1444
01:32:59,096 --> 01:32:59,997
Let's go. Get back to your
feet.

1445
01:33:00,031 --> 01:33:01,165
It's a smart thing.

1446
01:33:01,198 --> 01:33:03,200
He knows he has
the advantage on the feet.

1447
01:33:03,234 --> 01:33:04,435
Let's fight.

1448
01:33:04,469 --> 01:33:06,570
He has so much
experience with his striking.

1449
01:33:11,409 --> 01:33:14,445
He's trying to get a little wild.
This is going to favor Cash.

1450
01:33:15,312 --> 01:33:18,483
Big combination there from Cash.
He's rocking.

1451
01:33:26,290 --> 01:33:30,694
Picks him up.
Excellent double-legged takedown.

1452
01:33:30,728 --> 01:33:32,029
This is not good for Jett.

1453
01:33:32,063 --> 01:33:34,298
This is exactly what
happened to the [?].

1454
01:33:37,001 --> 01:33:38,602
This is a bad spot to be in.

1455
01:33:39,837 --> 01:33:41,439
There's only 10 seconds to go
here.

1456
01:33:41,473 --> 01:33:43,407
Let's see if he can
secure a position.

1457
01:33:43,441 --> 01:33:45,142
He could finish
it here in round one.

1458
01:33:48,646 --> 01:33:51,449
[bell rings]

1459
01:33:52,283 --> 01:33:55,820
Saved by the bell.
That was a close call.

1460
01:33:55,853 --> 01:33:57,922
[music]

1461
01:33:57,955 --> 01:33:59,558
A huge round for Cash.

1462
01:33:59,590 --> 01:34:01,493
Tyron, how'd you score
that first round?

1463
01:34:03,327 --> 01:34:05,996
It finished very strong with
the elbows, started off strong.

1464
01:34:06,030 --> 01:34:08,599
I'm going to go with a 10-9.
We will see what the judges say.

1465
01:34:08,632 --> 01:34:11,702
Wow, what a round by Cash.
My goodness.

1466
01:34:12,670 --> 01:34:14,438
Now, listen.
Listen to me carefully.

1467
01:34:15,172 --> 01:34:17,509
Please, don't brawl with this guy.
Don't fight with him.

1468
01:34:17,542 --> 01:34:19,276
Come on, Jett. You got this.

1469
01:34:19,310 --> 01:34:21,312
What does Jett need to do here to
even things up here in round two?

1470
01:34:21,345 --> 01:34:23,747
Well, Jett needs not
to play into Cash's game plan.

1471
01:34:23,781 --> 01:34:26,585
He was trying to scrawl and
brawl by standing in the pocket.

1472
01:34:26,617 --> 01:34:30,321
That's not the game plan.
He needs to use his distance, leg kicks.

1473
01:34:30,354 --> 01:34:31,755
Get in and get out. [bell rings]

1474
01:34:31,789 --> 01:34:35,159
Here, we go. Round two.
Cash coming out strong again.

1475
01:34:35,192 --> 01:34:37,728
Very aggressive.
Trying to back up Jett Boykins.

1476
01:34:38,062 --> 01:34:39,930
Jett has to do a better
job by sticking and moving,

1477
01:34:39,964 --> 01:34:42,366
using the distance,
getting in, and getting out.

1478
01:34:43,667 --> 01:34:45,703
Tyron, to your point,
he just did it right there.

1479
01:34:45,736 --> 01:34:48,973
Excellent lateral movement.
This is what we didn't see in round one.

1480
01:34:49,006 --> 01:34:55,713
[crowd cheers]

1481
01:34:55,746 --> 01:34:57,715
Oh my God, judo throw.
[crowd cheers]

1482
01:34:57,748 --> 01:35:00,552
Great reversal there by
Jett Boykins. There's his judo.

1483
01:35:00,585 --> 01:35:03,154
Those are the judo takeouts
we expected to see in round one.

1484
01:35:03,187 --> 01:35:04,722
See if he can limp leg out of
this.

1485
01:35:04,755 --> 01:35:06,390
Cash trying to turn
this into a single-leg

1486
01:35:06,423 --> 01:35:09,126
takedown and Jett
limp-legs out of it.

1487
01:35:09,160 --> 01:35:10,194
Back to the feet.

1488
01:35:15,666 --> 01:35:18,969
Much better defense there
from Jett Boykins this time out.

1489
01:35:19,003 --> 01:35:21,540
He's keeping him off balance.
Nice right hand as well.

1490
01:35:27,546 --> 01:35:29,113
Jett has enough against the
cage.

1491
01:35:35,019 --> 01:35:36,854
Needs to get that
space off the fence.

1492
01:35:39,356 --> 01:35:40,958
Great wrist control.

1493
01:35:42,193 --> 01:35:44,862
Beautiful throw.

1494
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:50,935
Nice [?].

1495
01:35:54,639 --> 01:35:56,707
Not a whole lot of time left
here, Tyron.

1496
01:35:57,808 --> 01:36:01,646
Big kick there by Jett Boykins.
[bell rings]

1497
01:36:02,213 --> 01:36:03,981
Yes, baby, yes.

1498
01:36:07,818 --> 01:36:09,119
It goes to the body.

1499
01:36:09,153 --> 01:36:11,623
What an end to the round
there from Jett Boykins.

1500
01:36:11,656 --> 01:36:15,460
You can see his confidence building.
Cash looks very frustrated.

1501
01:36:21,633 --> 01:36:24,603
That's what I'm talking about.
That was beautiful.

1502
01:36:24,636 --> 01:36:27,572
Great. Hey, he went in the corner
and listened to his coaches,

1503
01:36:27,606 --> 01:36:29,206
came out with a brilliant round.

1504
01:36:29,240 --> 01:36:32,076
Did stick and move, stole the
cookie, left the crumb behind.

1505
01:36:32,109 --> 01:36:34,445
That's what he has to do.
I call it one to one.

1506
01:36:34,479 --> 01:36:37,214
Keep kicking that leg till
it cannot stand no more,

1507
01:36:37,248 --> 01:36:38,816
and we're going to take
him to the ground.

1508
01:36:38,849 --> 01:36:41,785
Stay focused, stay focused
and go keep kicking that leg.

1509
01:36:42,186 --> 01:36:44,421
Absolutely amazing fight so
far.

1510
01:36:44,455 --> 01:36:46,625
let's what round three
has in store for us.

1511
01:36:50,828 --> 01:36:55,833
Here we go, Tyron.
That's a cheap shot by Cash.

1512
01:36:55,866 --> 01:36:57,636
Of course.
Why wouldn't Cash do that?

1513
01:36:57,669 --> 01:37:02,707
He's known for this.
He's foot-stomping.

1514
01:37:03,642 --> 01:37:06,944
That is not illegal, but that is
not cool here in mixed martial arts.

1515
01:37:12,283 --> 01:37:13,450
A big shot.

1516
01:37:14,018 --> 01:37:16,153
Mr. Referee.

1517
01:37:19,223 --> 01:37:20,324
Keep fighting.

1518
01:37:28,299 --> 01:37:30,034
This is not where Jett wants to
be.

1519
01:37:32,169 --> 01:37:33,538
Come on.

1520
01:37:33,571 --> 01:37:36,474
[?] not able to get control
here.

1521
01:37:43,914 --> 01:37:45,717
He's getting down
very low with his face.

1522
01:37:45,750 --> 01:37:46,884
He's ready for that throw.

1523
01:37:46,917 --> 01:37:50,488
Second bounce.
Cash is driving the cage.

1524
01:37:50,522 --> 01:37:51,889
[?] Stop driving the fence.

1525
01:37:51,922 --> 01:37:53,390
Yes, that's another cheap shot.

1526
01:37:55,092 --> 01:37:57,328
If he turns it into a takedown,
that should be a point deduction.

1527
01:38:01,766 --> 01:38:06,504
This referee is letting Cash get away
with some serious rule-bending here.

1528
01:38:24,188 --> 01:38:28,760
Remember how that feels, boy?

1529
01:38:33,798 --> 01:38:36,801
I made you, bitch.

1530
01:38:44,609 --> 01:38:48,912
Come on, come on.

1531
01:38:55,252 --> 01:38:56,954
Come on.

1532
01:39:01,892 --> 01:39:04,796
That's right, bitch.

1533
01:39:18,142 --> 01:39:23,748
You remember where you came
from.

1534
01:39:37,928 --> 01:39:38,929
Sit down.

1535
01:39:41,031 --> 01:39:42,500
What the hell are you doing?

1536
01:39:42,834 --> 01:39:43,802
Don't fight emotional.

1537
01:39:47,104 --> 01:39:49,674
Hey, listen guys.
Hey, Cash, if you grab the fence

1538
01:39:49,707 --> 01:39:51,910
like that again, I'm going to take
a point away. Do you understand?

1539
01:39:51,942 --> 01:39:53,210
You want to lose this fight?

1540
01:39:53,611 --> 01:39:55,312
So wake up and put
yourself together.

1541
01:39:55,847 --> 01:39:57,749
We're going to go back to the
plan.

1542
01:39:57,782 --> 01:40:00,852
We're going to go back to the kick
and the footwork and stay focused.

1543
01:40:00,885 --> 01:40:02,352
I am not a bitch.

1544
01:40:02,386 --> 01:40:04,455
You stick to the goal, boy.
Relax.

1545
01:40:04,489 --> 01:40:06,591
We're going to take him
to the ground again. Look at me.

1546
01:40:06,624 --> 01:40:09,193
Do you want to win this fight?
Okay, so we focus.

1547
01:40:09,226 --> 01:40:12,996
Keep the distance. Chop down that leg.
We just lost that round.

1548
01:40:13,030 --> 01:40:15,467
Okay, man. You do what you do.
We got this, all right?

1549
01:40:15,500 --> 01:40:17,635
You prepped for this.
Let's go. let's go.

1550
01:40:34,519 --> 01:40:36,888
[bell rings]

1551
01:40:36,921 --> 01:40:39,691
With Cash top on our scorecards
anyway, two to one,

1552
01:40:39,724 --> 01:40:42,159
Jett Boykins needs
to come out strong.

1553
01:40:55,573 --> 01:40:58,710
Beautiful kick to the head.

1554
01:41:35,947 --> 01:41:40,552
Okay, that's it. Stop right here.
Stop right there. Time out.

1555
01:41:40,585 --> 01:41:41,953
Go to the mutual corner right
there.

1556
01:41:41,986 --> 01:41:43,888
I told you last round,
grab the fence again,

1557
01:41:43,922 --> 01:41:46,791
I'm going to take a point away.
I got to take a point away.

1558
01:41:53,063 --> 01:41:55,767
That's one point deduction.
Red corner. Grabbing the fence.

1559
01:41:55,800 --> 01:41:59,003
That is going to help Jett.
Jett will be up in this round here.

1560
01:42:03,575 --> 01:42:04,976
Stay right there.

1561
01:42:05,009 --> 01:42:05,910
All right, guys,
We're going to restart this fight.

1562
01:42:05,944 --> 01:42:07,311
Let's clean it up, gentlemen.

1563
01:42:07,344 --> 01:42:09,581
Are you ready to go?
You ready to go? Let's fight.

1564
01:42:09,614 --> 01:42:11,616
That is going to give
some confidence back

1565
01:42:11,649 --> 01:42:14,117
to Cash as we start
this round again.

1566
01:42:14,151 --> 01:42:16,054
A big knee there.

1567
01:42:16,086 --> 01:42:23,027
[grunts]

1568
01:43:11,843 --> 01:43:13,410
Get off me.

1569
01:43:18,248 --> 01:43:19,917
[bell rings]

1570
01:43:22,185 --> 01:43:23,353
Fuck.

1571
01:43:23,387 --> 01:43:25,222
Go back to your corner.

1572
01:44:27,284 --> 01:44:29,687
This is it right here.
You ready to go?

1573
01:44:29,721 --> 01:44:31,089
You ready to go?

1574
01:44:31,122 --> 01:44:32,355
Let's fight.

1575
01:44:32,389 --> 01:44:33,925
Fifth and final round here.

1576
01:44:33,958 --> 01:44:36,259
Tyron, it's do or die for both
of these men.

1577
01:44:36,293 --> 01:44:37,895
What a combination by Cash.

1578
01:44:45,803 --> 01:44:47,939
Jett's starting to score
some combinations.

1579
01:44:48,305 --> 01:44:51,142
[crowd cheers]

1580
01:45:08,826 --> 01:45:12,230
Don't stop with the lyrics,
go to the fucking face!

1581
01:45:12,262 --> 01:45:13,765
Listen to your fucking trainer.

1582
01:45:13,798 --> 01:45:14,999
Come on, finish him.

1583
01:45:15,032 --> 01:45:16,901
Do what he fuckin' tells you
bitch.

1584
01:45:16,934 --> 01:45:17,735
Rip his face.

1585
01:45:17,769 --> 01:45:21,139
Do it. You fucking pussy.

1586
01:45:21,973 --> 01:45:23,340
Stop, stop.

1587
01:46:05,817 --> 01:46:07,819
No.

1588
01:46:14,659 --> 01:46:15,993
No, no, no, no, no.

1589
01:46:16,027 --> 01:46:17,261
He's blocking the referee.

1590
01:46:29,874 --> 01:46:34,245
I hope Jett is okay. This is not
a good moment right now.

1591
01:46:35,445 --> 01:46:40,017
[crowd booing]

1592
01:46:40,383 --> 01:46:42,687
We see very little
movement from Jett right now.

1593
01:46:42,720 --> 01:46:44,021
Jett, get up, man.

1594
01:46:44,055 --> 01:46:45,056
Yes.

1595
01:46:52,296 --> 01:46:53,931
This is a scary moment right
now.

1596
01:46:54,465 --> 01:46:55,233
What's going on?

1597
01:46:56,399 --> 01:46:57,101
Jett.

1598
01:46:57,134 --> 01:46:58,803
Get up, man.

1599
01:46:59,637 --> 01:47:01,404
Hey. Hey, Jett.

1600
01:47:04,709 --> 01:47:06,443
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I can't allow you...

1601
01:47:06,477 --> 01:47:08,246
Guys, guys, let her in. Let her
in.

1602
01:47:08,279 --> 01:47:14,318
Jett, Jett. Please, Jett.
Please, please.

1603
01:47:14,752 --> 01:47:19,957
Please. Jett, baby, wake up,
please.

1604
01:47:22,827 --> 01:47:25,428
Please, please.

1605
01:47:27,465 --> 01:47:29,033
His eyes, his eyes just moved.

1606
01:47:29,066 --> 01:47:30,735

1607
01:47:32,303 --> 01:47:33,971
[whispers]

1608
01:47:35,106 --> 01:47:39,844
Jett, are you okay?

1609
01:47:41,979 --> 01:47:43,581
Did I hear a loss?

1610
01:47:45,316 --> 01:47:47,084
Can we get a stretcher, please?

1611
01:47:47,318 --> 01:47:50,054
Hey, Jett, Jett, Jett.
We cannot take any risk.

1612
01:47:50,087 --> 01:47:51,155
No, please. I'm okay.

1613
01:47:51,188 --> 01:47:52,290
Stretcher.

1614
01:47:52,323 --> 01:47:54,825
Mom, mom. I'm fine, tell him.

1615
01:47:54,859 --> 01:48:00,498
I'm fine, mom. Mom, I'm okay.

1616
01:48:12,009 --> 01:48:15,780
I'm ok..

1617
01:48:18,616 --> 01:48:25,623

1619
01:48:58,923 --> 01:49:02,059
I'm so proud of you. I'm so
proud.

1625
01:53:23,754 --> 01:53:25,789
Take a look around me.

1626
01:53:26,790 --> 01:53:29,326
Taking pages from a magazine,

1627
01:53:30,528 --> 01:53:35,866
been looking for the answer
ever since we were seventeen.

1628
01:53:36,800 --> 01:53:42,607
You know the truth can be a weapon to
fight this world of ill intentions,

1629
01:53:43,774 --> 01:53:46,043
a new answer to the same
question,

1630
01:53:46,844 --> 01:53:50,347
how many times will
you learn the same lesson?

1631
01:53:51,683 --> 01:53:53,817
I think they got it all wrong.

1632
01:54:31,589 --> 01:54:36,827
This is what we came for,
and we couldn't want it anymore.

1633
01:54:38,195 --> 01:54:43,702
Could never turn back now,
got to leave it all on the floor.

1634
01:54:44,868 --> 01:54:51,175
Been dreaming of the payoff,
through the struggles and the trade-offs,

1635
01:54:51,208 --> 01:54:55,814
write in truth heading on the
way up, tell them the truth,

1636
01:54:55,846 --> 01:54:58,015
but they think it's just made
up.

1637
01:54:59,751 --> 01:55:01,553
I think they got it all wrong.

1638
01:55:02,886 --> 01:55:08,959
We just got to hold on,
and on, and on, and on

1639
01:55:10,027 --> 01:55:13,397
'cause we're going to be
legends,

1640
01:55:38,889 --> 01:55:41,325
Eventually, they're going to
know who's right.

1641
01:55:41,826 --> 01:55:45,229
To make a stand
you got to win the fight.

1642
01:55:45,262 --> 01:55:49,768
Can't stand the heat, then just
stay out the light for you might

1643
01:55:49,801 --> 01:55:52,537
never make it out alive.

1644
01:55:52,570 --> 01:55:55,807
You gotta live without
the columbines.

1645
01:55:55,840 --> 01:56:00,911
Let everybody hear your battle
cry.

1646
01:56:14,191 --> 01:56:20,264
Yes, we're going to be legends,
going to get their attention.

1647
01:56:21,031 --> 01:56:24,201
What we're doing
here ain't just scary.

1648
01:56:24,602 --> 01:56:29,507
It's about to be legendary.
We're going to be legends,

1649
01:56:31,308 --> 01:56:33,110
going to teach 'em all a lesson,

1650
01:56:34,712 --> 01:56:37,849
got this feeling that
we're so sweet caring.

1651
01:56:37,882 --> 01:56:41,285
It's about to be legendary.

1652
