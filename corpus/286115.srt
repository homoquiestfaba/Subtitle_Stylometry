00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:19,809
Hello, I'm Pado.

2
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:29,826
I chose that name 'cause
I want to live like a strong wave.

3
00:00:35,935 --> 00:00:38,199
When I was young, I saw
a young girl with straight hair.

4
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:41,138
She had beautiful eyes.

5
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:46,201
My heart beat, and I fell in love.

6
00:00:46,279 --> 00:00:49,806
Don't give me a hard time.
I really liked her.

7
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:52,544
Haa haa, you're pretty.
What's your name?

8
00:00:52,652 --> 00:00:55,348
It's Bada? Then I'll be Pado.

9
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:58,219
These days, nobody cares.

10
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:01,089
The withered soul
of the exhausted rose.

11
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:03,924
Come into by arms.
Hold out your arms.

12
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:06,795
I don't have anything
to soothe you.

13
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:10,029
Get lost. Don't babble on,
just get lost.

14
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:13,300
Get lost, you stupid fool.

15
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:17,036
Loving someone isn't a sin.
Tell me now.

Video Room

24
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:58,669
Bada, I love you

25
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:50,914
Fuck you. Get lost.

26
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:54,824
Get lost. Fuck you...

27
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,228
- What's up?
- Hey.

28
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,495
What do you want?

29
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:09,635
- What are you doing!
- Get lost, fuck you.

30
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:12,507
- What are you doing tonight?
- Just hanging out.

31
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:23,012
- Hey!
- What! You surprised me.

32
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:26,148
You should be studying
for your college exams.

33
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:29,160
Why do you keep going
to the video rooms?

34
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:35,398
Hey, where are you going?
We're getting together tonight.

35
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:37,163
Those guys?

36
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:40,963
- What's that?
- What do you think?

37
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,067
Good-for-nothings? Hey!

38
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:52,314
What is that?

39
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:55,512
Just keep up with your
studies, okay?

40
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,325
Where are you going?

41
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:04,556
You just get to your studying.

42
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:12,104
Hey, if you suck well,
I'll give you a tip.

43
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:15,899
Really?
What's a good suck?

44
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:19,877
Don't use your three front teeth.

45
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:24,912
Use your gums and
then take it in deep.

46
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:29,511
- Oh, is that so?
- Yeah, that's the best.

47
00:06:29,622 --> 00:06:33,058
If I do well, is there more than a tip?

48
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,559
- Of course.
- Is that so?

49
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:42,797
- But...
- What?

50
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:44,097
Your dick's not that great.

51
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:47,333
Hey, what do you mean?
It's been certified.

52
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:47,896
Really?

53
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:10,996
Hey, my ass isn't too clean.

54
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:17,593
Shit, it's been a while.

55
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:58,539
Fuck, you're a total sex machine.

56
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:04,573
Shit, yeah.

57
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:26,829
God, you're awesome.

58
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:32,810
Hey, still at it?

59
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:37,911
Give him some extra service
so I can get free meals.

60
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:40,943
Hurry up and finish it up.

61
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,688
I like you so much.

62
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:50,854
Really?

63
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,297
Grab me harder.

64
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:50,217
- Aren't you overdoing it?
- Nope.

65
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,917
- I'd like to see you come.
- Shit, just go on.

66
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,381
Hey, mister.
How much is a second round?

67
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:01,981
You want a second round?

68
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:07,455
Well, you know how it is these days.

69
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:09,790
It's about 15 grand.

70
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:15,562
Of course, a used one
only costs about 80 bucks.

71
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:19,269
I like your sense of humor.

72
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:22,774
It's my area of specialty.

73
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:27,779
Oh, she's taken.

74
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:30,213
She's expensive.

75
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:36,383
Damn, money, money.

76
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,284
I like your style.

77
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:54,340
Haa haa, you're pretty.
What's your name?

78
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,774
It's Bada? Then I'll be Pado.

79
00:12:56,842 --> 00:13:00,676
Yo yo yo yo, I really liked her.

80
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:04,111
Tell me now!

81
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:06,947
Thank you. I'll give it my best.

82
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:09,247
Bada, I love you!

83
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,194
Haven't seen you in a while.

84
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,960
I hear you've been studying hard.

85
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:22,632
I think I am.

86
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:27,732
Rumor has it you're dating
the gas delivery guy.

87
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:34,001
Here.

88
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:37,645
I'll get you money whenever I can.

89
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,719
I want news of my mom
as soon as possible.

90
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:43,512
You're close with the American soldiers.

91
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:45,317
You interested in working with me?

92
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:46,323
No.

93
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:50,851
I found a black dude, too.
You wanted to ride one.

94
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,124
Forget it.

95
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:57,960
You know the unit out front?
They love our video.

96
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:01,572
They're going crazy trying
to meet an Oriental chick.

97
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,803
- So why did you come?
- To inhale some bond.

98
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:44,082
I think I'll get a job.

99
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:52,180
Come and learn how
to shave at my store.

100
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:55,393
I don't want to.

101
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,393
Don't act so elegant.

102
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:04,664
I didn't want to say this,
but you don't have any skills.

103
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:08,503
And it's not like you have
a good education.

104
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:25,381
I won't tell your sister,
just think about it.

105
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:31,220
A customer told me today.

106
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:33,959
If you fuck American soldiers,

107
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:38,333
you can learn English and earn dollars.

108
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:50,247
Should I test this ring?

109
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:57,586
What is that?

110
00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:01,285
This? It's a ring.

111
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:05,029
I'm gonna show you the
time of your life tonight.

112
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:10,265
It's almost time for my
sister to come back.

113
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:11,394
Yeah?

114
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:20,201
Hey, look at this. Do you see this?

115
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:25,707
Wanna do it?

116
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,009
How much did you pay?

117
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:29,780
This?

118
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:35,489
You know me, I didn't pay for it.

119
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:40,828
I bought it with a tip.
I'll turn off the light.

120
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:58,789
- Now what?
- Hold still.

121
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:37,693
That hurts.

122
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,584
Mother fucking assholes.

123
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,226
Hey, what the fuck are you doing!

124
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,353
Who do you think you are?

125
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:39,488
I'm the gas delivery boy.

126
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:42,465
What are you gonna
achieve by staring at me?

127
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:43,933
Goddamn.

128
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:48,029
I paid taxes to have this road paved.

129
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:50,540
I threw tofu on that road,
got a problem?

130
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:54,670
You mother fucker.
I'm talking to you.

131
00:21:54,746 --> 00:22:03,450
If you keep up that attitude
you won't last long.

132
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:06,217
Fucker.

133
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:09,192
You fucking asshole. Goddamnit!

134
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:32,474
You want to try that
Hong Kong kiss again?

135
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:22,144
Hey, when did you start seeing
that fucker behind my back?

136
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:27,348
Who are you to tell me what to do?

137
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:29,689
What are you, my mom or dad?

138
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:33,363
That money you gave me?
Take it back.

139
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:35,865
I don't need your sympathy.

140
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:38,466
Are you rich, moron?

141
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:39,936
Hey!

142
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:43,463
Go ahead, hit me.
You can't even hit me.

143
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,635
Ooh, you little...

144
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:49,544
What are you getting worked up for?

145
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:55,112
Goddamn. Fine, forget it.

146
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:58,622
What have you ever done for me?

147
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:00,624
You didn't do shit.

148
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:06,891
If I was treated that way,
I'd at least give my body.

149
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:13,262
Now I see the truth.

150
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:17,100
Is that why you were so nice to me?

151
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:20,234
Is that what the money was for?

152
00:26:27,285 --> 00:26:28,718
Stupid fool.

153
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:38,020
Do you really wanna do it with me?

154
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:52,701
You're a sex man? Yes.

155
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:56,229
Really? Yes, okay.

156
00:27:57,042 --> 00:28:00,034
Tell me, hair. Hair, hair, hair.

157
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:02,579
Lots of hair means lots of sex.

158
00:28:02,647 --> 00:28:05,548
No hair means bad luck.

159
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:07,584
Who says so? You ever do it?

160
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:10,450
You ever eat one? No hair?

161
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:12,521
What are you doing?

162
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:17,956
Bada, I really wanted to do it with you.

163
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:21,493
You know how I feel, don't you?

164
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:26,998
I don't care if you're not a virgin.

165
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:29,904
I won't leave you.

166
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:33,073
It's my first.

167
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:37,981
Fuck, yeah right.
There aren't any virgins.

168
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:43,919
Just look at me.

169
00:28:43,988 --> 00:28:46,752
I'll kill you if you do a messy job.

170
00:30:01,766 --> 00:30:02,664
Is it okay?

171
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:08,436
Forget it. I'm gonna kill you.

172
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:12,304
What am I gonna do.

173
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:14,937
Here, wipe my face.

174
00:30:15,713 --> 00:30:17,203
It's all yours anyway.

175
00:30:17,282 --> 00:30:19,273
Still, wipe it.

176
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:22,952
There isn't any. It's clean.

177
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:29,553
- Really?
- Is it sticky?

178
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:41,031
Isn't it sticky here?
It looks like it would be.

179
00:30:41,105 --> 00:30:44,268
Hey, why do you have
such a big butt?

180
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,175
Hey, I'm a glamour girl.

181
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:50,515
You call this glamour?
This is glamour?

182
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:53,348
- Hey, don't hit me.
- Quiet.

183
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:55,779
Can't I smack you?

184
00:30:55,887 --> 00:31:05,159
- It hurts.
- What hurts?

185
00:31:05,897 --> 00:31:07,762
It hasn't even gone in yet.

186
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:10,624
It hurts 'cause you're
about to put it in.

187
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,242
It's yours.

188
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:31,982
Here.

189
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:43,830
Hey, I could massage you with this.

190
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:48,335
I could rub this all over your body.

191
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:51,001
I don't want a massage.

192
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:54,539
That tickles.

193
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:12,458
Stop running away.

194
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:26,804
That tickles.

195
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:28,038
Hold still.

196
00:32:37,188 --> 00:32:38,177
That tickles.

197
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,507
Hold on, I'll touch you up front.

198
00:32:58,576 --> 00:33:00,908
Don't.

199
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:04,506
- Why?
- It tickles, stop.

200
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:09,654
Really, stop. That tickles.

201
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,121
Is it good if it tickles?

202
00:33:11,222 --> 00:33:12,746
No, it tickles.

203
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:14,825
- It doesn't feel good?
- No, it tickles.

204
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:18,362
- Oh, it came undone.
- I undid it.

205
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:20,397
Why?

206
00:33:21,532 --> 00:33:22,794
So I can look at your breasts.

207
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:46,020
Ow, that hurts.

208
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:47,284
Hold on.

209
00:33:47,992 --> 00:33:49,323
Quit now.

210
00:33:50,261 --> 00:33:51,785
I'm being gentle.

211
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:52,989
You're not.

212
00:33:53,064 --> 00:33:54,292
I'll be gentle.

213
00:34:24,862 --> 00:34:25,920
Don't make me hurt.

214
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:27,225
Okay.

215
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:31,198
It doesn't look like it'll
hurt, it'll go right in.

216
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,036
- What?
- It hurts.

217
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:42,079
Just be patient.

218
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:52,286
Why?

219
00:35:00,998 --> 00:35:02,863
Just a minute.

220
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:14,971
Lift your arms.

221
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:16,843
Why do you have your clothes on.

222
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:18,973
- Come on.
- Why?

223
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:20,641
- It's cold.
- You're cold?

224
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:24,187
I'll make you sweat.
Are you embarrassed?

225
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,950
I'll take it off for you.

226
00:35:47,411 --> 00:35:49,038
That tickles.

227
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:52,080
Where? Down below? Or your tits?

228
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:54,447
- Here.
- Your nipple?

229
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:12,296
Does that tickle?

230
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:18,865
Hold on a sec.

231
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:27,943
Doesn't it feel good
when you do it together?

232
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:32,386
Oh, you're sweating. You poor thing.

233
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:34,454
I like it.

234
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:42,793
- Hey.
- What?

235
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:46,401
I can feel it coming. I'm gonna come.

236
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:47,334
Go ahead.

237
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:49,032
No, I'm gonna make it last.

238
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:51,442
- Just do it.
- No, I want it to last.

239
00:36:51,442 --> 00:36:52,909
Let's take a break.

240
00:36:57,415 --> 00:37:00,248
- Come on.
- Doesn't it feel good?

241
00:37:01,285 --> 00:37:04,220
- No.
- Really?

242
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:05,220
Hurry up and finish it.

243
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:06,153
Why?

244
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:08,618
I want to keep it inside.

245
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:10,820
Fine, suit yourself.

246
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:14,797
You want it, don't you?

247
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:18,593
Pado, ow.

248
00:37:18,669 --> 00:37:19,567
What?

249
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:22,970
My legs are gonna rip apart. Hold on.

250
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,372
Don't hit me.

251
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:29,446
My legs.

252
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:40,885
Want me to bite you again?

253
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:46,786
That tickles.

254
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:50,698
Don't hit me.

255
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,907
Hey, stop going down there.

256
00:38:00,978 --> 00:38:02,639
You keep pushing me.

257
00:38:09,553 --> 00:38:11,521
I'm going to fall off.

258
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:12,954
I'm holding you.

259
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,434
Doesn't that feel good?

260
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:27,204
Now what?

261
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:29,999
Hold on.

262
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,601
Hey, slow down. Slowly.

263
00:38:58,669 --> 00:38:59,567
Why?

264
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:00,501
Slow down.

265
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:47,177
Why did you do that?

266
00:39:47,284 --> 00:39:48,945
Hold on.

267
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:25,247
You know what?

268
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:27,085
All those videos are
all a bunch of bull.

269
00:40:28,225 --> 00:40:31,854
You know they just keep
going on and on.

270
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:36,593
We only did it for about 5 minutes.

271
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:39,427
Yeah, it's all bull.

272
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,972
And you were so dry.

273
00:40:41,972 --> 00:40:45,271
It wasn't wet.
I thought I was gonna die.

274
00:40:45,342 --> 00:40:47,105
So, you didn't like it?

275
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:49,271
Of course I did.

276
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:53,577
Hey, should I check and
see if you're a virgin?

277
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:57,178
- Forget it.
- Come on.

278
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:04,719
Am I?

279
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:08,564
You lied, didn't you?

280
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,031
No.

281
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,068
Yes, you did.

282
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,603
I can't lie.

283
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:16,264
So, why doesn't it show?

284
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,705
That's possible.

285
00:41:18,676 --> 00:41:22,079
It's okay.
Look at all those movies.

286
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:26,539
Nobody ever tells a girl
to get lost 'cause

287
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,982
she's not a virgin.

288
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:34,814
Real men don't say stuff like that.
Only good-for-nothings do.

289
00:41:35,626 --> 00:41:36,718
You're a good-for-nothing.

290
00:41:36,794 --> 00:41:40,631
No, I'm not.
You're the good-for-nothing.

291
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:42,758
- No, I'm not.
- Yeah, you are.

292
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:45,802
- No, I'm not.
- Sure you are.

293
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:47,861
So, are you gonna leave me?

294
00:41:48,572 --> 00:41:49,834
Hey, I'm not your mom.

295
00:41:50,741 --> 00:41:52,606
Don't talk about her.

296
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:53,734
Okay.

297
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:57,510
- Hey, I have to go.
- Why?

298
00:41:57,581 --> 00:42:00,709
My boss is gonna throw a fit.

299
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:03,787
Why is he always on your case?

300
00:42:03,888 --> 00:42:06,948
He's really driving me
crazy these days.

301
00:42:07,057 --> 00:42:09,924
- I'm gonna shower.
- Yeah, go ahead.

302
00:42:13,163 --> 00:42:14,960
Hey, throw that away.

303
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:16,659
Hey, this is made in the USA.

304
00:42:16,734 --> 00:42:18,292
It smells. Just throw it away.

305
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:22,738
Hey, where are my socks?

306
00:42:23,407 --> 00:42:25,238
- Socks?
- Yeah.

307
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:26,867
Aren't you wearing them?

308
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:29,435
- I can't find them.
- You took them off?

309
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,741
It must be there somewhere.

310
00:42:31,815 --> 00:42:34,113
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

311
00:42:49,266 --> 00:42:51,393
Wow, this is great.

312
00:42:55,606 --> 00:42:56,698
Special forces.

313
00:42:56,774 --> 00:42:59,641
When I was a staff sergeant,

314
00:43:00,477 --> 00:43:03,913
first class men beat me up real bad.

315
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:09,249
So I lose it once in a while.

316
00:43:09,353 --> 00:43:12,117
You weren't a first class
man, were you?

317
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:19,552
A pardon is really good
from a national perspective.

318
00:43:20,731 --> 00:43:25,327
What's your relation with her?

319
00:43:26,971 --> 00:43:28,438
Didn't she tell you?

320
00:43:28,505 --> 00:43:32,999
No, I heard about you
for the first time today.

321
00:43:34,044 --> 00:43:35,909
Will you all leave?

322
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:41,916
Hey, let's eat.

323
00:43:41,986 --> 00:43:45,046
- We don't have any gas.
- Order some.

324
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:52,019
Hey, I want to get rid
of all this prison dust.

325
00:43:52,096 --> 00:43:54,223
You got a problem?

326
00:43:57,034 --> 00:43:59,696
Just leave, Bada will be home soon.

327
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:03,872
Now that you mention it,
what is she doing?

328
00:44:03,941 --> 00:44:09,846
Bitch doesn't even show when I'm here.

329
00:44:09,913 --> 00:44:12,609
I'm being treated like dirt.

330
00:44:12,716 --> 00:44:16,447
What's the use of getting out?
It's prison here, too.

331
00:44:17,521 --> 00:44:20,319
Hey! Go order some gas.

332
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:23,986
I'll do that. Gas...

333
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,333
Water should be water.

334
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:36,232
Who ordered gas?

335
00:44:36,306 --> 00:44:38,240
Let's go party.

336
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:41,106
Hey, shithead.

337
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:42,702
What the...

338
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:45,476
Don't you remember me? Tofu?

339
00:44:45,549 --> 00:44:48,916
You crazy ass. You followed me here?

340
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:51,647
Goddamn.

341
00:44:51,755 --> 00:44:54,451
Isn't it a small world?
Meeting you here.

342
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:59,588
Yeah, I like your eyes.
Come on, let's go.

343
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,554
Hand over 100,000 won.

344
00:45:01,632 --> 00:45:02,900
What?

345
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:06,961
To pay for gas, humiliation
and cleaning by bike.

346
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:10,230
Mother fuckers.

347
00:45:11,942 --> 00:45:14,712
Hand it over before let this explode.

348
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:17,272
Goddamn.

349
00:45:17,915 --> 00:45:19,940
Let's just split it in half.

350
00:45:21,285 --> 00:45:25,153
Goddamn, I don't have
the time or money.

351
00:45:25,756 --> 00:45:32,629
You jack off or whatever.
Just pay for half of the meter.

352
00:45:32,629 --> 00:45:38,864
I'll give you 36,000 won.
Let's wash the car 3 times.

353
00:45:39,837 --> 00:45:46,572
There's a car wash right there.
Let's go on in, come on.

354
00:47:29,546 --> 00:47:34,245
Come on. Oh, yeah.

355
00:47:43,093 --> 00:47:54,630
When mother goes to
gather oysters...

356
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:09,308
It's me, you know where
we played that doll game?

357
00:48:09,419 --> 00:48:11,353
Be there by 7.

358
00:48:12,122 --> 00:48:15,990
You're dead if you're late.
See you then.

359
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:23,328
Look, aren't you going
to play a video?

360
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:29,361
Not this, you know,
men and women making love.

361
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:35,311
What? Enforcement? Bullshit.

362
00:48:35,379 --> 00:48:39,748
Turn it on before I report
you for letting minors in.

363
00:48:41,118 --> 00:48:44,554
You've gotten so pretty.
You're studying?

364
00:48:45,622 --> 00:48:48,455
- Give it to me.
- The original?

365
00:48:48,525 --> 00:48:52,962
Not yet. I'm not threatening you.

366
00:48:53,797 --> 00:48:57,995
You didn't mind before.
What's your problem?

367
00:48:59,002 --> 00:49:01,027
Give me the tape.

368
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:05,404
Your mom's really good
with the black dude.

369
00:49:05,475 --> 00:49:07,773
I enjoyed watching the tape.

370
00:49:08,412 --> 00:49:12,109
She made it for a whore
to get to the States.

371
00:49:12,182 --> 00:49:13,513
Son-of-a-bitch.

372
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:16,916
I know where your mom is.

373
00:49:20,557 --> 00:49:23,025
- She's on an island.
- What island?

374
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:26,596
An island that gets big
when you touch it.

375
00:49:28,432 --> 00:49:31,765
By the way, you wanna fuck me?

376
00:51:26,183 --> 00:51:30,119
You and me are both kids of a whore.

377
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:35,654
Let's block off all the holes.

378
00:51:50,807 --> 00:51:57,645
Close them all up.
Cover you asshole, too.

379
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:08,951
What are you doing?

380
00:52:09,759 --> 00:52:15,425
Come here and see.
Your sister's got a great pussy.

381
00:52:15,499 --> 00:52:21,438
Should I bond off yours, too?

382
00:52:21,505 --> 00:52:26,033
Crazy ass. Get out. Get out of here.

383
00:52:26,109 --> 00:52:30,341
Did you ever see a fist go in?

384
00:52:30,413 --> 00:52:32,506
I just put it in.

385
00:52:32,582 --> 00:52:38,543
See? This went in.
Should I try yours?

386
00:52:42,893 --> 00:52:45,225
You've totally lost it.

387
00:52:45,896 --> 00:52:48,956
Just proves you're a whore's son.

388
00:52:49,132 --> 00:52:56,197
Right, I'm a whore's son
And you're a whore's daughter.

389
00:52:58,074 --> 00:53:02,534
I'll lick yours, too. Come here.

390
00:53:32,776 --> 00:53:34,266
When did you get here?

391
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:37,137
Don't go about so late.

392
00:53:55,265 --> 00:53:57,699
I got a lot of free meals thanks to you.

393
00:54:03,607 --> 00:54:08,476
I've become a totally
new person. See?

394
00:54:14,718 --> 00:54:17,186
How's your studying?

395
00:54:17,854 --> 00:54:21,221
Get your hands off. Don't touch her.

396
00:54:23,994 --> 00:54:28,021
What's your problem? Don't overdo it.

397
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:30,794
Do you know how
shocked she was last time?

398
00:54:31,401 --> 00:54:35,235
Didn't you have enough in prison?
Leave her alone.

399
00:54:35,305 --> 00:54:37,637
Go way!

400
00:54:37,707 --> 00:54:39,572
Disappear from our sight.

401
00:54:40,977 --> 00:54:45,573
Fine, I'll go. I'm going.

402
00:54:48,585 --> 00:54:50,883
I'm leaving, bitch!

403
00:54:54,991 --> 00:54:57,289
Goddamn. Have a good life.

404
00:55:38,468 --> 00:55:40,936
Hey, gas!

405
00:56:26,583 --> 00:56:29,177
Hey, you're an awesome rider.

406
00:56:30,453 --> 00:56:33,013
Hey, when I was a staff officer,

407
00:56:33,123 --> 00:56:36,957
I was in the mobile bike unit.

408
00:56:37,026 --> 00:56:39,790
Staff officers don't ride bikes.

409
00:56:39,863 --> 00:56:41,387
Forget that.

410
00:56:41,464 --> 00:56:43,227
Aren't you making any deliveries?

411
00:56:43,299 --> 00:56:45,392
Fuck, I was fired.

412
00:56:46,369 --> 00:56:47,734
What's that?

413
00:56:47,804 --> 00:56:50,440
I can't look like I'm not working.

414
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:53,534
My boss didn't like
the way my eyes looked.

415
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:56,904
I didn't have enough
of an education either.

416
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:59,574
What a strange mother fucker.

417
00:56:59,649 --> 00:57:02,641
What does gas delivery
have to do with that?

418
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:06,155
Character and education...

419
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:08,850
Those kind of people ask for more.

420
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:11,917
Those mother fuckers.

421
00:57:11,995 --> 00:57:14,657
That can't be the reason.

422
00:57:15,865 --> 00:57:17,389
Hello, I'm Pado.

423
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:20,630
Is the title 'Blackman'?

424
00:57:20,703 --> 00:57:21,533
Yes.

425
00:57:22,806 --> 00:57:23,704
Go ahead.

426
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:26,640
God doesn't rule the world.

427
00:57:26,709 --> 00:57:32,045
Hoodlums do.
Headbands and crew cuts.

428
00:57:32,148 --> 00:57:34,048
Get this. Fucking get out of here.

429
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:39,053
Short hair, black ties, black cars.

430
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:44,424
We should die our hair, too.
Get down.

431
00:57:44,494 --> 00:57:50,524
Stop. You call that a rap?
It's a hoodlum theme song.

432
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:52,932
You know how to beat box?

433
00:57:53,002 --> 00:57:54,162
No.

434
00:57:54,237 --> 00:57:56,728
Send the next person in.

435
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:05,771
Is it your job to put
young people down?

436
00:58:07,951 --> 00:58:14,982
You don't like kids with
dyed hair and raised bikes?

437
00:58:16,726 --> 00:58:21,493
Does a judge look at
the world like that?

438
00:58:23,566 --> 00:58:28,435
The world is like this
'cause of people like you

439
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:34,239
driving around in foreign cars,
you mother fucker!

440
00:58:35,044 --> 00:58:39,606
Asshole. Have you ever
taken the muffler off?

441
00:58:46,055 --> 00:58:48,717
Go away, if you're done
with your business.

442
00:58:50,927 --> 00:58:52,155
Any ramen noodles?

443
00:58:53,663 --> 00:58:55,358
Then leave after you eat.

444
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:59,259
You got gimchi, too?

445
00:58:59,335 --> 00:59:00,529
Okay.

446
00:59:01,838 --> 00:59:03,738
- Bring some chopsticks.
- Okay.

447
00:59:08,511 --> 00:59:10,809
I'll sleep here today.

448
00:59:13,249 --> 00:59:15,649
Oh, that was good.

449
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:22,013
I want to succeed.
I want to live in style.

450
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:24,889
Hey, go ahead then.
Who's stopping you?

451
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:29,262
Man man man.
That's life. Man man man.

452
00:59:30,133 --> 00:59:33,364
Some have rich parents.
Man man man.

453
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:37,369
My life sucks. Man man man.

454
00:59:37,974 --> 00:59:40,204
It's trash. Man man man.

455
00:59:41,277 --> 00:59:43,768
Life is a blackhole. Man man man.

456
00:59:43,846 --> 00:59:46,781
Hey, that's good. It's great.

457
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:49,579
Do you know what
the song's about?

458
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:50,879
That was a song?

459
00:59:53,823 --> 00:59:59,284
I got an idea.
Do you have a manager?

460
00:59:59,996 --> 01:00:02,021
Are you kidding?

461
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:06,828
You know that guy we saw last time?

462
01:00:06,903 --> 01:00:11,397
"Thank you for the nice meal, sir."

463
01:00:11,474 --> 01:00:14,102
He owns a barber shop.

464
01:00:14,177 --> 01:00:17,476
He has some customers that
go on stage at night.

465
01:00:17,547 --> 01:00:20,083
Want me to introduce you?

466
01:00:20,083 --> 01:00:22,278
No, that's embarrassing.

467
01:00:22,385 --> 01:00:25,843
Why? It makes good money.

468
01:00:26,656 --> 01:00:30,251
You've got possibilities.

469
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:37,595
What, you don't like him?

470
01:00:39,202 --> 01:00:43,639
He's a famous rapper.

471
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:47,471
You ever hear about people
dancing to rap

472
01:00:47,543 --> 01:00:50,205
in an American soldiers' cabaret?

473
01:00:50,279 --> 01:00:55,740
The Yankees like to mambo,
jitterbug and tango.

474
01:00:55,852 --> 01:00:59,652
I guess this won't work.

475
01:01:00,623 --> 01:01:03,319
Who's going to employ him?

476
01:01:03,393 --> 01:01:05,588
He's perfect for fast food deliveries.

477
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:10,531
You son-of-a-bitch. What did you say?

478
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:14,502
Hey, you should be patient.

479
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:19,234
Goddamn. And is this a proper place...

480
01:01:19,308 --> 01:01:23,802
Hey, what's your problem?
Things were going fine.

481
01:01:25,481 --> 01:01:28,143
Goddamn, how embarrassing.

482
01:01:28,251 --> 01:01:36,522
Hey, I had an idea
as an ex-staff officer.

483
01:01:36,592 --> 01:01:40,790
How about making
a video tape of you?

484
01:01:40,863 --> 01:01:43,627
Record you rapping and
then send the tape to people.

485
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:45,565
- That's a great idea.
- Isn't it?

486
01:01:45,635 --> 01:01:47,432
Right.

487
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:51,101
But, we don't have a camera.

488
01:01:51,174 --> 01:01:57,807
Don't worry.
Cameras are everywhere downtown.

489
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:03,512
Hey, are you a fashion designer?

490
01:02:03,619 --> 01:02:05,109
Go back to your shop
and cut some hair.

491
01:02:05,221 --> 01:02:08,281
Your job's done.

492
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:13,184
And don't tell my sister I'm here.

493
01:02:13,262 --> 01:02:20,498
Okay. By the way,
she said she'll report you.

494
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:21,195
So be careful.

495
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:25,434
What did I do?
I only touched her like this.

496
01:02:25,508 --> 01:02:29,444
I heard all about it.
You loosened your belt, too.

497
01:02:30,012 --> 01:02:32,845
And, why do you keep yelling at me?

498
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:36,043
I heard it from Nami.

499
01:02:36,152 --> 01:02:38,746
Hey, I'm going to leave.

500
01:02:38,855 --> 01:02:42,621
Goddamn, what about the camera?

501
01:02:44,327 --> 01:02:45,555
Where can we get one?

502
01:02:46,129 --> 01:02:47,357
At the grocery.

503
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:48,328
A disposable?

504
01:02:48,397 --> 01:02:49,227
Yeah.

505
01:02:49,298 --> 01:02:51,596
Go cut some hair.

506
01:02:51,667 --> 01:02:54,534
You're always yelling at me.

507
01:02:56,005 --> 01:02:58,803
A disposable?
How much is a disposable?

508
01:02:58,875 --> 01:03:00,843
How much is it?

509
01:03:00,910 --> 01:03:02,878
Goddamn.

510
01:03:06,182 --> 01:03:10,141
It's me. Can you come out tonight?

511
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:13,946
Goddamn, are you coming or not?

512
01:03:15,858 --> 01:03:23,390
Hey, who is that with you?
I hear a guy's voice.

513
01:03:24,333 --> 01:03:25,766
Oh, the TV?

514
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:30,367
Hey, and, you know?

515
01:03:30,439 --> 01:03:34,603
You know that guy at the club?

516
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:39,545
No, the one that makes videos.
Yeah, Jjangga.

517
01:03:39,615 --> 01:03:45,884
He's got a camera, doesn't he? Yeah.

518
01:03:45,955 --> 01:03:48,947
Can you borrow his camera?

519
01:03:49,058 --> 01:03:50,150
I'll ask him.

520
01:03:50,226 --> 01:03:52,786
Yeah, no, I'll call you back.

521
01:03:52,862 --> 01:03:55,831
Okay.

522
01:04:13,316 --> 01:04:14,510
That tickles.

523
01:04:14,617 --> 01:04:16,778
Did you wash your socks?

524
01:04:16,886 --> 01:04:17,818
Why?

525
01:04:18,788 --> 01:04:21,018
It has a strange odor.

526
01:04:22,959 --> 01:04:24,085
But I like it.

527
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:47,342
Oh, really.

528
01:04:59,128 --> 01:05:01,528
Your mustache hurts.

529
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:06,427
Stop it, I know you like it.

530
01:05:26,656 --> 01:05:32,891
You like it? I know you like it.

531
01:06:58,748 --> 01:07:01,444
Your breasts have gotten bigger.

532
01:07:30,112 --> 01:07:31,875
I know you like it. You like it?

533
01:07:31,947 --> 01:07:35,542
Goddamn, that hurts.

534
01:09:09,645 --> 01:09:12,443
I'm gonna do it 'til my legs give.

535
01:09:12,748 --> 01:09:15,512
God, I look like a frog.

536
01:09:16,685 --> 01:09:18,243
Who cares?

537
01:09:24,193 --> 01:09:27,959
Forget how you look. It feels good.

538
01:10:07,503 --> 01:10:10,631
Why are you wearing army boots?

539
01:10:10,739 --> 01:10:13,435
You'll be wearing enough
of them in the army.

540
01:10:13,509 --> 01:10:17,206
They're great for kicking.

541
01:10:20,583 --> 01:10:23,882
Goddamn, why are you spitting on it?

542
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:29,357
Hey, this isn't American.

543
01:10:30,859 --> 01:10:37,128
Look, K-O-, Korea.

544
01:10:37,766 --> 01:10:40,758
Look, Made in U.S.A.

545
01:10:40,836 --> 01:10:45,500
Where? U.S.A.?

546
01:10:46,408 --> 01:10:49,536
So why does it have Korean writing?

547
01:10:49,612 --> 01:10:51,136
How do I know?

548
01:10:52,348 --> 01:10:54,441
You're gonna succeed.

549
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:56,210
That'll be good.

550
01:11:02,358 --> 01:11:03,484
Hi.

551
01:11:09,565 --> 01:11:10,691
Bada!

552
01:11:11,433 --> 01:11:13,025
What's your problem?

553
01:11:13,702 --> 01:11:15,363
Hey, talk to me.

554
01:11:16,238 --> 01:11:18,900
That guy in there is my brother.

555
01:11:21,477 --> 01:11:22,637
Really?

556
01:11:22,745 --> 01:11:25,441
So what?

557
01:11:27,583 --> 01:11:29,073
Hey, Bada!

558
01:11:36,692 --> 01:11:41,288
Pado, I think I'll move overseas.

559
01:11:41,363 --> 01:11:42,796
Where?

560
01:11:43,666 --> 01:11:45,065
Texas.

561
01:11:45,768 --> 01:11:47,292
I want to go to Manhattan.

562
01:11:47,903 --> 01:11:51,304
They make dates at 10 at night.

563
01:11:51,874 --> 01:11:55,571
It's not in style there to make
dates at 7 like we do.

564
01:11:56,745 --> 01:11:59,077
That's why I like
Manhattan songs, too.

565
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:01,412
- You know that song?
- What?

566
01:12:01,517 --> 01:12:03,007
Kiss and Say Goodbye.

567
01:12:03,118 --> 01:12:06,884
Well, I think so.

568
01:12:10,025 --> 01:12:13,153
I have to make a confession.

569
01:12:19,568 --> 01:12:24,130
My mom's a whore.
An international callgirl.

570
01:12:26,375 --> 01:12:27,933
Surprised?

571
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:30,102
I don't care.

572
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:33,047
It's no big deal.

573
01:12:36,185 --> 01:12:38,085
One more thing.

574
01:12:39,555 --> 01:12:46,484
He's not my real brother,
but that guy that was with you,

575
01:12:47,329 --> 01:12:49,422
he raped me.

576
01:12:53,635 --> 01:12:57,765
Can you still date me?

577
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:05,370
Now that you're shocked,
let me tell you one more.

578
01:13:06,715 --> 01:13:12,745
I know where my mom is.
She's in Texas.

579
01:13:14,156 --> 01:13:17,819
Not the U.S. Texas,
the Texas in Korea.

580
01:13:30,339 --> 01:13:35,743
Hey! Why did you like me if
you're gonna leave like that?

581
01:13:36,545 --> 01:13:38,911
You think I dated you for sex?

582
01:13:42,918 --> 01:13:45,079
I used this camera before.

583
01:14:05,007 --> 01:14:07,908
Hey, look at this camera.
It's a really good camera.

584
01:14:07,976 --> 01:14:09,375
Didn't you see during the
Sydney Olympics?

585
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:12,209
People were filming everywhere.

586
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:16,115
S-O-N-Y. Sony.

587
01:14:16,218 --> 01:14:19,847
The Japanese know a good thing.

588
01:14:19,955 --> 01:14:22,515
They make good products.

589
01:14:22,624 --> 01:14:24,888
What's the problem?

590
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:41,008
You're her step-brother.

591
01:14:41,610 --> 01:14:46,104
How could you?
You call yourself a brother?

592
01:14:47,449 --> 01:14:51,476
Get out. Get out now,
you mother fucker!

593
01:15:00,829 --> 01:15:02,353
That was a mistake.

594
01:15:07,002 --> 01:15:08,663
It was fun.

595
01:15:32,394 --> 01:15:33,986
This is a present.

596
01:15:43,872 --> 01:15:49,071
Should we move far away?

597
01:15:49,745 --> 01:15:50,905
Why?

598
01:15:52,314 --> 01:15:56,080
I met your brother today.

599
01:15:56,952 --> 01:16:00,820
- Did he talk about me?
- Yes.

600
01:16:05,627 --> 01:16:07,686
You know what?

601
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:13,495
What?

602
01:16:17,506 --> 01:16:18,837
Nothing.

603
01:16:20,976 --> 01:16:25,276
Gee. That's okay. Don't tell me.

604
01:16:26,048 --> 01:16:30,815
Secrets should be kept secret.

605
01:16:35,357 --> 01:16:38,224
- You know what?
- What?

606
01:16:40,062 --> 01:16:43,463
I think I'll move far
away with my sister.

607
01:18:15,757 --> 01:18:21,923
I searched for my mom so much.
I saw the tape of her.

608
01:18:24,666 --> 01:18:28,830
She was in a motel room
with a black man.

609
01:18:30,005 --> 01:18:35,102
The face on the screen
was definitely my mom.

610
01:18:36,144 --> 01:18:46,076
What's shocking is that it
was my brother who filmed it.

611
01:19:25,961 --> 01:19:30,330
Hello, I'm Pado.

612
01:19:33,802 --> 01:19:38,330
I chose that name 'cause I
want to live like a strong wave.

613
01:19:44,312 --> 01:19:49,181
I made this for my girlfriend.

614
01:19:51,853 --> 01:19:57,348
I'm quite a rapper for a
high school dropout.

615
01:20:00,996 --> 01:20:02,827
I'll do a rap.

616
01:20:05,233 --> 01:20:06,700
Actually...

617
01:20:08,904 --> 01:20:13,136
I borrowed this camera
from my girlfriend.

618
01:20:19,381 --> 01:20:22,043
Goddamn. The battery's dead.

619
01:20:29,558 --> 01:20:31,492
What's this?

620
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:07,428
Hey! Jjangga!

621
01:21:10,165 --> 01:21:11,962
What's the problem with you.

622
01:21:12,033 --> 01:21:14,228
Goddamn, mother fucker.

623
01:21:14,302 --> 01:21:18,238
Where did you shoot this?

624
01:21:19,407 --> 01:21:21,466
What are you thinking
about, you son-of-a-bitch?

625
01:21:21,543 --> 01:21:25,138
Where's Bada? Where is she?

626
01:21:34,990 --> 01:21:39,359
Where's Bada? Tell me!

627
01:21:48,603 --> 01:21:52,437
Now!

628
01:22:34,516 --> 01:22:37,917
I think I'll move overseas.
