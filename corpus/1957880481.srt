0
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,172
Okay, design team?

1
00:01:01,275 --> 00:01:02,835
Final touches
on the kitchen placements.

2
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:04,379
Roger.

3
00:01:04,482 --> 00:01:07,482
Homeowners are 20 minutes away!
Let's move, people!

4
00:01:07,586 --> 00:01:09,758
Thank you!
Good morning, John.

5
00:01:11,413 --> 00:01:13,620
Let's touch up on
the baseboard molding.

6
00:01:13,724 --> 00:01:15,758
And I thought we were
doing... ooh, I like that.

7
00:01:15,862 --> 00:01:17,044
I thought we were doing garland

8
00:01:17,068 --> 00:01:18,655
and Christmas ornaments
on the mantle.

9
00:01:18,758 --> 00:01:21,275
Where's Pablo?
Pablo!

10
00:01:21,379 --> 00:01:23,896
Oh, there she goes again.

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,655
Are you sure you
want to ignore her?

12
00:01:25,758 --> 00:01:27,424
No, she has a certain
tone when she's serious.

13
00:01:27,448 --> 00:01:29,448
That was only a 3.5 on
the Richter scale, so...

14
00:01:29,551 --> 00:01:30,758
Pablo!

15
00:01:30,862 --> 00:01:34,862
That was a 9.
See what she wants.

16
00:01:34,965 --> 00:01:36,517
Living room, stat!

17
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,079
- Good luck.
- Yeah, I don't like the rug.

18
00:01:38,103 --> 00:01:39,355
The pile's running
the wrong way,

19
00:01:39,379 --> 00:01:40,419
and it needs to be flipped

20
00:01:40,482 --> 00:01:42,068
before we bring in
the coffee table.

21
00:01:42,172 --> 00:01:44,010
- The pile, you can see that?
- Of course I can see that.

22
00:01:44,034 --> 00:01:46,310
The fibers run in
only one direction.

23
00:01:46,413 --> 00:01:47,448
Hi, guys, hi.

24
00:01:47,551 --> 00:01:48,872
Uh, we don't have
time for... for this.

25
00:01:48,896 --> 00:01:50,355
The homeowners are
gonna be here in 15 minutes.

26
00:01:50,379 --> 00:01:51,655
All right, then slow them down.

27
00:01:51,758 --> 00:01:54,034
And they have pets,
so this needs to go outside.

28
00:01:54,137 --> 00:01:55,482
Thank you!

29
00:01:55,586 --> 00:01:58,068
Can I get a PA?

30
00:01:58,172 --> 00:01:59,965
I swear this happens
every episode.

31
00:02:00,068 --> 00:02:02,655
Yeah? Well, you'd
think you'd learn by now.

32
00:02:08,413 --> 00:02:11,034
You guys, what
is taking so long?

33
00:02:12,724 --> 00:02:15,758
Okay, now...
Uh, wow.

34
00:02:15,862 --> 00:02:17,241
Blue pumpkins.
Uh, Stella,

35
00:02:17,344 --> 00:02:20,172
don't you think this
table is a little over the top?

36
00:02:20,275 --> 00:02:22,275
Well, their kitchen was
their biggest complaint.

37
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:23,631
They couldn't host
for the holidays.

38
00:02:23,655 --> 00:02:25,275
Now they can.

39
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,586
Okay, they're gonna
host this many people?

40
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,655
Relax, Grinch, it's
Thanksgiving, okay?

41
00:02:30,758 --> 00:02:32,137
Okay, you two, chill.

42
00:02:32,241 --> 00:02:34,827
First of all, a Grinch
is a Christmas thing,

43
00:02:34,931 --> 00:02:36,172
not a Thanksgiving thing.

44
00:02:36,275 --> 00:02:38,172
And we're here to make over
their home, Stella,

45
00:02:38,275 --> 00:02:41,172
- not their... lives.
- Same thing.

46
00:02:41,275 --> 00:02:43,275
Ooh, she shoots, she scores!

47
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:45,103
Two points for Team Stella.

48
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:46,769
You know she always
has to have the last word.

49
00:02:46,793 --> 00:02:48,137
Sure do, sure do!

50
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:51,551
When you purchased this house,
you put your trust...

51
00:02:51,655 --> 00:02:53,689
and your life
savings into our hands.

52
00:02:53,793 --> 00:02:57,413
And we treated every
penny like it was our own.

53
00:02:57,517 --> 00:02:59,551
Reba and Andre?

54
00:02:59,655 --> 00:03:02,448
Welcome home!

55
00:03:02,551 --> 00:03:06,448
Oh my god!
That's not our house.

56
00:03:06,551 --> 00:03:08,931
No, that's your home.

57
00:03:09,034 --> 00:03:10,586
Come on, let's go check it out!

58
00:03:10,689 --> 00:03:11,827
Come on.

59
00:03:11,931 --> 00:03:13,000
A and B cam, leave them in.

60
00:03:13,103 --> 00:03:14,931
No, no, A, stay in position one.

61
00:03:15,034 --> 00:03:16,103
Here we go!

62
00:03:16,206 --> 00:03:17,413
- I can't believe it!
- What!?

63
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:24,310
Let's talk about the kitchen.

64
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:27,655
Pablo and I had a difference
in opinion on this room.

65
00:03:27,758 --> 00:03:30,965
Blood was spilled
over this kitchen.

66
00:03:31,068 --> 00:03:32,482
- It was not.
- Blood.

67
00:03:32,586 --> 00:03:35,482
Oh, I love this island!

68
00:03:35,586 --> 00:03:38,068
Stella tortured
me over every detail,

69
00:03:38,172 --> 00:03:39,931
like the shape of the island.

70
00:03:40,034 --> 00:03:42,448
Rhombus, scalene, parallelogram?

71
00:03:42,551 --> 00:03:43,896
Cracked, cracked, cracked.

72
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,620
I wanted something
with a little flair.

73
00:03:45,724 --> 00:03:47,931
What's wrong with
a simple square? Huh?

74
00:03:48,034 --> 00:03:49,620
Maybe because it's
more of a rectangle?

75
00:03:49,724 --> 00:03:51,044
If we're talking about
a kitchen island,

76
00:03:51,068 --> 00:03:52,862
it's like a rectangle,
not a square.

77
00:03:52,965 --> 00:03:56,655
Would you say this island
is more rectangle or square?

78
00:03:56,758 --> 00:03:58,793
- Rectangle.
- Hm!

79
00:03:58,896 --> 00:04:02,413
Oh, we're gonna have the
most amazing Thanksgiving.

80
00:04:02,517 --> 00:04:05,689
Wait 'til you check out
the new convection steam oven

81
00:04:05,793 --> 00:04:08,379
that I picked out for you guys.

82
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:10,000
And you don't
have to worry about kids

83
00:04:10,103 --> 00:04:12,827
or sticky fingerprints with
this stainless steel finish.

84
00:04:12,931 --> 00:04:16,310
Well, we're gonna
put that to the test.

85
00:04:16,413 --> 00:04:20,310
We were gonna wait to tell you.
I'm pregnant.

86
00:04:20,413 --> 00:04:22,379
Ah! Oh my god!

87
00:04:22,482 --> 00:04:25,103
This house and now a baby...

88
00:04:25,206 --> 00:04:26,551
all of our dreams have
come true.

89
00:04:26,655 --> 00:04:28,175
- I knew you were glowing!
- Thank you!

90
00:04:28,241 --> 00:04:33,620
Oh my goodness,
I'm so happy for you!

91
00:04:33,724 --> 00:04:37,655
Congratulations.
Aww...

92
00:04:53,586 --> 00:04:55,827
Do you think we switch it or...

93
00:04:55,931 --> 00:04:59,137
I think we just don't
tell Zoe anything.

94
00:04:59,241 --> 00:05:02,758
- Hey, honey.
- Mm, Jack, hi!

95
00:05:04,862 --> 00:05:07,034
Congrats.
One down, one more to go.

96
00:05:07,137 --> 00:05:08,241
I can't wait.

97
00:05:08,344 --> 00:05:09,976
Once we get the Christmas
episode in the can,

98
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,517
we'll be finished
for the season.

99
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,551
And we have so much to
do before the wedding.

100
00:05:14,655 --> 00:05:18,551
- You two, uh, set a date?
- Yeah, uh, April.

101
00:05:18,655 --> 00:05:21,310
The wedding's in April.

102
00:05:21,413 --> 00:05:22,724
- Congrats.
- Thanks.

103
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:26,000
You didn't tell him?

104
00:05:29,241 --> 00:05:31,758
Okay, people,
uh, meeting in here now.

105
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:36,241
What's going on?

106
00:05:36,344 --> 00:05:39,379
Oh, hey, Jack.
Good to see you.

107
00:05:39,482 --> 00:05:40,655
What's all this?

108
00:05:40,758 --> 00:05:43,137
Oh, just consider it
an early Christmas gift.

109
00:05:43,241 --> 00:05:45,586
My latest business venture.

110
00:05:45,689 --> 00:05:47,275
Blue Ocean. Fun name.

111
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:49,103
Salmon in Aspic.
Wow.

112
00:05:49,206 --> 00:05:50,586
Faroe Island Green.

113
00:05:50,689 --> 00:05:52,068
What's next?
Blushing Bride?

114
00:05:52,172 --> 00:05:54,103
Already taken.

115
00:05:54,206 --> 00:05:57,068
Introducing Turner
and Klee House Paint.

116
00:05:57,172 --> 00:05:59,068
Put a little color in your life.

117
00:05:59,172 --> 00:06:01,275
We go public in the
first quarter of next year.

118
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:03,689
Just like a walking infomercial.

119
00:06:03,793 --> 00:06:05,355
I'm telling you, this
guy can sell anything.

120
00:06:05,379 --> 00:06:06,596
You know, Turner
and Klee's looking for

121
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,793
a corporate sponsor, Zoe.

122
00:06:07,896 --> 00:06:09,376
I don't know if
the show's interested,

123
00:06:09,448 --> 00:06:11,931
but we'd be willing to
supply all our paint gratis.

124
00:06:12,034 --> 00:06:14,793
Ooh, my favorite word.
Let me run it up the food chain.

125
00:06:14,896 --> 00:06:19,000
Okay, so... on to other things.

126
00:06:19,103 --> 00:06:20,206
I just found out that our

127
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,137
Christmas house
location fell through.

128
00:06:22,241 --> 00:06:23,344
The homeowners backed out.

129
00:06:23,448 --> 00:06:24,517
- What?
- Are you kidding?

130
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,907
This is the biggest
episode of the year.

131
00:06:25,931 --> 00:06:27,896
Yep, and Christmas
is five weeks away.

132
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,344
Okay, well, what
about a clip show?

133
00:06:30,448 --> 00:06:32,551
Well, it's boring.
Where's the conflict?

134
00:06:32,655 --> 00:06:37,344
We need a location
with a killer story.

135
00:06:37,448 --> 00:06:40,172
You know...

136
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:43,310
Stella just bought a house.

137
00:06:43,413 --> 00:06:46,103
- What's your... what's your point?
- What kind of house?

138
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:48,551
Victorian, 1910.

139
00:06:48,655 --> 00:06:51,482
- Something to flip?
- No, no, no.

140
00:06:51,586 --> 00:06:53,758
It's my
great-great-grandmother's,

141
00:06:53,862 --> 00:06:56,482
and Jack and I plan on
living there after the wedding.

142
00:06:56,586 --> 00:06:59,379
Well, we were talking about it.

143
00:06:59,482 --> 00:07:01,206
Location?

144
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,517
Lexington, right near my mom's.

145
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,724
Um, perfect.

146
00:07:04,827 --> 00:07:06,586
No, no, no, it's
not perfect, Zoe.

147
00:07:06,689 --> 00:07:10,034
I just closed escrow, and it's
not even been cleaned out yet.

148
00:07:10,137 --> 00:07:12,448
That's even better for us.
That cuts off one day of work.

149
00:07:12,551 --> 00:07:15,724
- It's perfect, actually.
- No... okay.

150
00:07:15,827 --> 00:07:17,931
- It looks terrible.
- How bad could it be?

151
00:07:18,034 --> 00:07:20,482
There's a family of possums
living under the stairs.

152
00:07:20,586 --> 00:07:22,172
People love possums.

153
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,172
Stella, think about it.

154
00:07:26,275 --> 00:07:28,448
Maybe we can have the house
renovated in half the time.

155
00:07:28,551 --> 00:07:31,103
Yeah, but I'm not in a hurry.
It's a labor of love.

156
00:07:31,206 --> 00:07:33,206
You guys, I spent every
Christmas there as a kid.

157
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,965
That place is very
special to me.

158
00:07:35,068 --> 00:07:36,724
Okay, I am loving
the family angle.

159
00:07:36,827 --> 00:07:38,620
I love it.
Uh, but what's the hook?

160
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:40,793
Okay, there is no hook,
because there is no episode.

161
00:07:43,655 --> 00:07:45,034
Here's a crazy idea, Stel.

162
00:07:45,137 --> 00:07:50,862
What if we moved up the
wedding and had it there?

163
00:07:50,965 --> 00:07:52,689
That's brilliant!
I love that. I love that.

164
00:07:52,793 --> 00:07:55,310
We do the vows and the reveal
at the house at the same time

165
00:07:55,413 --> 00:07:57,103
on Christmas Eve.

166
00:07:57,206 --> 00:07:59,827
Okay, now we're getting...
Now we're getting crazy.

167
00:07:59,931 --> 00:08:01,241
Stella, our ratings are down.

168
00:08:01,344 --> 00:08:02,769
We don't have a pickup
for next season.

169
00:08:02,793 --> 00:08:04,517
This could be the
ammo that we need.

170
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,689
Come on, Stel!
Think of how fun it would be

171
00:08:06,793 --> 00:08:09,103
to bring that place back to
life.

172
00:08:09,206 --> 00:08:11,448
Okay, are you all still trying
to convince me to do this?

173
00:08:11,551 --> 00:08:12,448
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

174
00:08:12,551 --> 00:08:14,724
- Yeah.
- Oh my god.

175
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,310
- So when can we see it?
- Never.

176
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,103
As in tomorrow, 10:00 AM?
Great.

177
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,655
Thanks, Stel!

178
00:08:19,758 --> 00:08:21,665
You won't even know we're there,
like little mice running around.

179
00:08:21,689 --> 00:08:23,413
Possums, even.

180
00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:30,586
So you've set a wedding date.

181
00:08:30,689 --> 00:08:33,413
Ah, I'm sorry I didn't
mention it to you.

182
00:08:33,517 --> 00:08:37,310
I told you about my divorce
before I even told my ex-wife.

183
00:08:37,413 --> 00:08:39,620
- Yeah.
- Anyway, um...

184
00:08:39,724 --> 00:08:42,448
I understand if you,
uh, feel a little nervous.

185
00:08:42,551 --> 00:08:44,275
About what? The wedding?

186
00:08:44,379 --> 00:08:47,448
No, about using your
house for the show.

187
00:08:47,551 --> 00:08:49,241
I know we all ganged
up on you back there.

188
00:08:49,344 --> 00:08:50,655
I mean, I get it, Pablo.

189
00:08:50,758 --> 00:08:52,700
Everybody's job depends on
if the show gets renewed.

190
00:08:52,724 --> 00:08:55,034
Gabe just bought a new house,
and Zoe's adding on to hers.

191
00:08:55,137 --> 00:08:58,000
But, I mean...
it's a big decision.

192
00:08:58,103 --> 00:09:00,482
Yeah, well, totally.
And you don't...

193
00:09:00,586 --> 00:09:04,551
You don't have to decide today.
No pressure.

194
00:09:04,655 --> 00:09:07,000
But tomorrow...
Tomorrow?

195
00:09:07,103 --> 00:09:09,241
Okay, good night!
We'll see!

196
00:09:16,655 --> 00:09:22,034
♪ I light a candle, put the
presents 'round the tree ♪

197
00:09:24,068 --> 00:09:29,793
♪ The sound of carols
fills the air ♪

198
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:34,689
♪ Outside, the snow is falling

199
00:09:34,793 --> 00:09:38,379
♪ I hear the children calling

200
00:09:38,482 --> 00:09:43,517
♪ The way it always used to be

201
00:09:45,827 --> 00:09:51,137
♪ I still remember how we
loved this time of year ♪

202
00:09:52,965 --> 00:09:58,862
♪ We kissed beneath
the mistletoe ♪

203
00:10:00,172 --> 00:10:03,862
♪ And as I hung the ivy

204
00:10:03,965 --> 00:10:06,137
♪ I felt two arms around me

205
00:10:06,241 --> 00:10:07,689
Hey, y'all in here?

206
00:10:07,793 --> 00:10:11,103
- In here, Mom!
- I'm a little early.

207
00:10:14,689 --> 00:10:18,068
Oh, just look at this place.

208
00:10:18,172 --> 00:10:19,941
If you squint hard enough,
you can almost see Grandma

209
00:10:19,965 --> 00:10:21,827
putting ornaments on
the Christmas tree.

210
00:10:21,931 --> 00:10:24,827
She always put it right here.

211
00:10:24,931 --> 00:10:26,931
- Uh-huh.
- Aw, Grandma.

212
00:10:30,965 --> 00:10:33,379
Do you think
this is insane, Mom?

213
00:10:33,482 --> 00:10:35,700
Oh honey, you know I think
everything about your business

214
00:10:35,724 --> 00:10:37,655
is insane.

215
00:10:38,758 --> 00:10:42,586
Look, Jack wants a big wedding.

216
00:10:42,689 --> 00:10:45,862
And you want something
more intimate.

217
00:10:45,965 --> 00:10:50,379
And this place kind of
takes care of both.

218
00:10:50,482 --> 00:10:52,458
This house has brought
our family so much happiness

219
00:10:52,482 --> 00:10:54,068
over the years.

220
00:10:54,172 --> 00:10:56,827
Why not share that with the
people who watch your show?

221
00:11:00,586 --> 00:11:02,896
Wow, this place must've
really been something

222
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,551
back in the day.

223
00:11:05,655 --> 00:11:08,103
It is every bit as
awful as you described.

224
00:11:08,206 --> 00:11:10,862
- What? What's that smell?
- Mm-hmm.

225
00:11:10,965 --> 00:11:12,034
Is that the possums?

226
00:11:12,137 --> 00:11:14,413
Okay, stop criticizing
the place, Pablo.

227
00:11:14,517 --> 00:11:15,976
Jack and I are gonna
be very happy here

228
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,448
once it's all fixed up.

229
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,896
Right, yeah, um...

230
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,103
babe, this woodwork is...

231
00:11:25,206 --> 00:11:26,586
oppressive.

232
00:11:26,689 --> 00:11:29,413
It just needs to be
cleaned up and oiled.

233
00:11:29,517 --> 00:11:32,241
Mm-mm, yeah, no,
I agree with Jack.

234
00:11:32,344 --> 00:11:34,482
Come on, guys, open your eyes.
Use your imagination.

235
00:11:34,586 --> 00:11:36,896
You all talked me into this.
Do you remember?

236
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,379
I just don't see how
we can turn this... no offense...

237
00:11:41,482 --> 00:11:44,379
Dumpster fire into
something that's camera ready.

238
00:11:44,482 --> 00:11:45,724
Dumpster fire?
You don't...

239
00:11:45,827 --> 00:11:47,596
You don't even know
anything about this house.

240
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:50,517
It's a little bit more
Grey Gardens than I imagined.

241
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,206
Should've worn my headscarf.

242
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:53,655
Okay, this was your idea, Zoe.

243
00:11:53,758 --> 00:11:56,206
No, I know, I'm just saying.
Wow.

244
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:58,724
Okay, I... I get it.

245
00:11:58,827 --> 00:12:02,689
She's ready for a new chapter,
and it's gonna be a lot of work.

246
00:12:02,793 --> 00:12:06,172
But I know exactly what
to do to bring her back.

247
00:12:06,275 --> 00:12:09,000
So it's happening.
We're doing this.

248
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:11,586
- You sure, Stella?
- Yes, my mind is made up, Mom.

249
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:12,827
- Okay.
- Mmkay.

250
00:12:12,931 --> 00:12:14,965
We're gonna need
to get started ASAP.

251
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,803
You know, my house is
right around the corner,

252
00:12:16,827 --> 00:12:18,872
if you wanted to set up a
temporary production office

253
00:12:18,896 --> 00:12:21,137
- and get a jump start.
- Okay.

254
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,700
Jump start... yeah, we're
gonna need a time machine

255
00:12:22,724 --> 00:12:24,275
to pull this off.

256
00:12:24,379 --> 00:12:26,000
I think I'm gonna
stay at the condo.

257
00:12:26,103 --> 00:12:27,517
Good luck, guys!

258
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,137
What is that smell?

259
00:12:30,413 --> 00:12:32,310
All right, so,
my new fabric collection

260
00:12:32,413 --> 00:12:34,344
has got to be many things.

261
00:12:34,448 --> 00:12:37,586
First and foremost, sustainable.
Secondly, affordable.

262
00:12:37,689 --> 00:12:39,965
And thirdly,
of course, luxurious.

263
00:12:40,068 --> 00:12:43,862
I mean, look at this
glorious chantone vegan silk.

264
00:12:43,965 --> 00:12:47,275
It is just perfect.
So happy with that.

265
00:12:47,379 --> 00:12:50,586
The velvet, now,
it is luxurious.

266
00:12:50,689 --> 00:12:52,931
It is positively decadent.

267
00:12:53,034 --> 00:12:55,137
It takes the dyes beautifully.

268
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:58,000
But there's a problem
with these long fibers.

269
00:12:58,103 --> 00:13:00,793
They're going to be an
absolute magnet for pet hairs.

270
00:13:00,896 --> 00:13:02,724
And we know everyone
loves their pets.

271
00:13:02,827 --> 00:13:05,862
So this one, we need
something more practical.

272
00:13:07,793 --> 00:13:09,689
Oh, why don't you take a break?

273
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:15,862
- Stella?
- Freddie, I'm in a panic,

274
00:13:15,965 --> 00:13:17,241
and I need your help.

275
00:13:17,344 --> 00:13:18,458
With the show or the wedding?

276
00:13:18,482 --> 00:13:20,103
Both.
How much time do you have?

277
00:13:20,206 --> 00:13:21,862
Oh, you know, I'm
just getting ready

278
00:13:21,965 --> 00:13:23,845
to launch my new fabric
collection at Highpoint,

279
00:13:23,931 --> 00:13:26,379
but... just the usual
sturm und drang.

280
00:13:26,482 --> 00:13:27,722
Remember when I worked for you,

281
00:13:27,793 --> 00:13:29,251
and you said there was
no project or no deadline

282
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:31,241
that was ever too challenging?

283
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:33,000
I have one of those situations.

284
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:35,103
That sounds like fun!
Can I help?

285
00:13:35,206 --> 00:13:36,562
You don't even know
what I'm asking.

286
00:13:36,586 --> 00:13:38,241
Look, just tell
me where and when.

287
00:13:40,482 --> 00:13:42,655
Let me get this
planning stuff out of the way.

288
00:13:42,758 --> 00:13:45,034
I don't know how I'm ever
gonna thank you enough, Mom.

289
00:13:45,137 --> 00:13:46,803
Well, I'll take care
of the wedding details,

290
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:49,206
and you just concentrate
on the house.

291
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:51,551
Okay, let's get this
meeting started, shall we?

292
00:13:51,655 --> 00:13:53,034
What's that for?

293
00:13:53,137 --> 00:13:55,137
Oh, it's our list of
potential cast members...

294
00:13:55,241 --> 00:13:56,872
Subs who will work under
the worst conditions

295
00:13:56,896 --> 00:13:59,758
without cracking and still be
ready to do another take.

296
00:13:59,862 --> 00:14:02,620
No. No, thank you.

297
00:14:02,724 --> 00:14:03,793
No.

298
00:14:03,896 --> 00:14:05,344
He's the best
HVAC guy in the biz.

299
00:14:05,448 --> 00:14:08,724
Yeah, I'm not
babysitting him again.

300
00:14:08,827 --> 00:14:10,620
- No.
- You don't like Vern?

301
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:12,137
I would fall on
my sword for Vern.

302
00:14:12,241 --> 00:14:13,700
Come on, he's been
with us since day one.

303
00:14:13,724 --> 00:14:15,413
- Day one.
- Yes, yeah,

304
00:14:15,517 --> 00:14:17,931
I was, uh, pretty sure
that Vern retired.

305
00:14:18,034 --> 00:14:19,275
And we're trying to go younger.

306
00:14:19,379 --> 00:14:22,620
How about, uh,
tattooed roto-rooter guy?

307
00:14:22,724 --> 00:14:24,344
- Mm...
- Ew.

308
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:25,827
Zoe, I don't know
if you know this,

309
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:27,758
but Vern is a family friend.

310
00:14:27,862 --> 00:14:29,262
He worked with my
husband for years.

311
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:31,103
Yes, my dad
was a structural engineer

312
00:14:31,206 --> 00:14:33,448
and loved saving old buildings.
Vern was his best friend.

313
00:14:33,551 --> 00:14:35,320
When Stella was a kid,
she used to visit jobsites

314
00:14:35,344 --> 00:14:36,620
with Vern and her father.

315
00:14:36,724 --> 00:14:38,458
It's where she fell in love
with all this stuff.

316
00:14:38,482 --> 00:14:39,689
Come on, Zoe!

317
00:14:39,793 --> 00:14:40,803
He's like everyone's
favorite uncle, right?

318
00:14:40,827 --> 00:14:42,241
Okay, enough with
the heartstrings.

319
00:14:42,344 --> 00:14:43,827
Vern lives for now...

320
00:14:43,931 --> 00:14:46,051
If he's, uh, willing to
come out of retirement for it.

321
00:14:46,137 --> 00:14:48,275
Okay, but no cameras
during my wedding prep.

322
00:14:48,379 --> 00:14:50,724
- That's my time.
- And no ambushing people.

323
00:14:50,827 --> 00:14:52,044
We know how much
she likes surprises.

324
00:14:52,068 --> 00:14:54,241
Yeah, you like to do that.

325
00:14:54,344 --> 00:14:56,206
You two are gonna
drive me crazy.

326
00:14:58,241 --> 00:14:59,724
Fine, I guess.

327
00:15:12,448 --> 00:15:13,655
Action.

328
00:15:13,758 --> 00:15:14,931
Normally you'd see us

329
00:15:15,034 --> 00:15:16,596
welcome a family on
our first walkthrough,

330
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,137
but today I am that family.

331
00:15:19,241 --> 00:15:21,758
This beautiful home was built
by my great-great-grandparents

332
00:15:21,862 --> 00:15:23,034
back in 1910.

333
00:15:23,137 --> 00:15:25,000
I spent every holiday
here growing up.

334
00:15:25,103 --> 00:15:28,034
And now I'm ready to
come home for Christmas.

335
00:15:28,137 --> 00:15:29,482
Welcome home!

336
00:15:29,586 --> 00:15:32,068
So, we got a
transitional Victorian

337
00:15:32,172 --> 00:15:35,344
with a ton of
architectural influences.

338
00:15:35,448 --> 00:15:37,827
English manor house,
Arts and Crafts,

339
00:15:37,931 --> 00:15:39,482
Richardsonian Romanesque,

340
00:15:39,586 --> 00:15:41,000
a touch of Gothic.

341
00:15:41,103 --> 00:15:42,965
Notice the sandstone
course at the base,

342
00:15:43,068 --> 00:15:45,896
the patterned shingles,
the pitched roof.

343
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,310
About 25 years ago,
my family sold the house

344
00:15:48,413 --> 00:15:50,137
after my grandmother had passed.

345
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:53,758
The family that bought it said
they were "expert DIYers."

346
00:15:53,862 --> 00:15:55,965
They needed to watch
a whole bunch more HGTV,

347
00:15:56,068 --> 00:15:58,551
- 'cause it is bad!
- It's bad.

348
00:15:58,655 --> 00:16:00,655
And then they lost
the house in foreclosure,

349
00:16:00,758 --> 00:16:03,413
so it's been empty
for almost two years...

350
00:16:03,517 --> 00:16:06,137
Except for the
family of possums.

351
00:16:06,241 --> 00:16:09,379
But hey, think of
all the possum-bilities.

352
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:14,172
Okay, Captain, so
what is the plan?

353
00:16:14,275 --> 00:16:15,862
We've got four weeks,
three days,

354
00:16:15,965 --> 00:16:17,413
and a budget of 92-5,

355
00:16:17,517 --> 00:16:20,034
which should be enough to
cover just about everything.

356
00:16:20,137 --> 00:16:23,586
Oh! Okay, uh, let's...
Let's take a look inside,

357
00:16:23,689 --> 00:16:25,249
see if there's anything
worth salvaging.

358
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:27,206
- Salvaging?
- I'm just kidding.

359
00:16:29,379 --> 00:16:33,586
It's so cute!
So many memories.

360
00:16:36,241 --> 00:16:37,586
Nice.

361
00:16:38,482 --> 00:16:40,103
Oh!
Now you're proposing?

362
00:16:40,206 --> 00:16:41,206
Ah, yeah, right.

363
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:42,665
Well, you know
I'm already engaged.

364
00:16:42,689 --> 00:16:45,103
I am never getting
married ever again.

365
00:16:45,206 --> 00:16:47,862
No, I want to point
out the floors.

366
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:51,034
Red oak.
This is spectacular.

367
00:16:51,137 --> 00:16:52,551
You know,
you would pay a fortune

368
00:16:52,655 --> 00:16:55,413
- for this type of wood nowadays.
- If you could even find it.

369
00:16:55,517 --> 00:16:57,965
And it's a great
distraction from the carpet,

370
00:16:58,068 --> 00:16:59,862
which was blue,
like, 800 years ago.

371
00:16:59,965 --> 00:17:01,241
Okay, you know what?

372
00:17:01,344 --> 00:17:03,103
We need to just focus
on the positive here.

373
00:17:03,206 --> 00:17:05,482
Positive, uh, the...
The pet stains!

374
00:17:05,586 --> 00:17:07,448
They give it character.
It's beautiful.

375
00:17:07,551 --> 00:17:09,827
Okay, you know what?
When I look around,

376
00:17:09,931 --> 00:17:13,137
all I see are nothing
but possibilities!

377
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:16,379
And Stella's possibilities
give me nothing but headaches.

378
00:17:16,482 --> 00:17:19,172
All right, I'm thinking...
Think along with me.

379
00:17:19,275 --> 00:17:22,206
Picture this.
If we... we just knock,

380
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:25,827
gently knock, the walls
down to the kitchen,

381
00:17:25,931 --> 00:17:28,655
and just let the space breathe
a little bit, open it up.

382
00:17:28,758 --> 00:17:30,241
- Is he for real?
- I am.

383
00:17:30,344 --> 00:17:31,724
No.

384
00:17:31,827 --> 00:17:33,320
These walls have been here
for over 100 years, Pablo.

385
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:35,424
- They're not going anywhere.
- It'd look great, though.

386
00:17:35,448 --> 00:17:36,655
Mm-mm.

387
00:17:36,758 --> 00:17:38,318
We'll do a little,
like, facelift to it,

388
00:17:38,379 --> 00:17:41,862
but they're not coming down.
Yeah, no.

389
00:17:41,965 --> 00:17:43,344
- Thanks, though!
- All right!

390
00:17:43,448 --> 00:17:44,941
You can have a coffee.
I'm gonna get my sledgehammer.

391
00:17:44,965 --> 00:17:46,655
Okay, you're not actu...
You're not...

392
00:17:46,758 --> 00:17:48,551
You're not getting
the sledgehammer, Pablo!

393
00:17:48,655 --> 00:17:51,103
Okay, he needs to really
give the sledgehammer a rest.

394
00:17:51,206 --> 00:17:53,344
We're here to honor
the past, not erase it.

395
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:57,482
- She's gonna thank me later.
- Get that out of here!

396
00:17:59,068 --> 00:18:00,310
Stella!

397
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,182
Freddie Greene is my
go-to, bring in the cavalry

398
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,620
interior designer
extraordinaire.

399
00:18:03,724 --> 00:18:05,931
She has an expertise
with historic homes

400
00:18:06,034 --> 00:18:08,355
and knows how to bring in just
the right amount of contemporary

401
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:09,689
without breaking the bank.

402
00:18:09,793 --> 00:18:11,931
She taught me everything I know.

403
00:18:12,034 --> 00:18:15,275
Stella, this must've been
such a wonderful space, I know.

404
00:18:15,379 --> 00:18:16,758
And we're gonna bring it back.

405
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:18,965
I mean, come on,
think of all those

406
00:18:19,068 --> 00:18:21,310
great memories you'll make.

407
00:18:21,413 --> 00:18:23,093
Do you remember the
first thing you learned

408
00:18:23,137 --> 00:18:25,172
- when you came to work for me?
- Of course!

409
00:18:25,275 --> 00:18:27,344
You can always undo a mistake.

410
00:18:27,448 --> 00:18:29,206
Nothing's fatal.
Nothing's final.

411
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:31,931
Except for maybe this kitchen.

412
00:18:32,034 --> 00:18:33,458
And he really has
to be here, does he?

413
00:18:33,482 --> 00:18:34,896
I ask myself that every day.

414
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
What do we call this color?

415
00:18:37,103 --> 00:18:40,655
Ah, that would be
Hospital Ward White.

416
00:18:41,517 --> 00:18:42,827
Okay, on Christmas Eve,

417
00:18:42,931 --> 00:18:44,491
we're hosting my
wedding reception here.

418
00:18:44,586 --> 00:18:46,448
And it is a small group,
but we definitely need

419
00:18:46,551 --> 00:18:48,758
a fully functioning kitchen.

420
00:18:48,862 --> 00:18:52,034
Okay, I'm just gonna
put this out there.

421
00:18:52,137 --> 00:18:56,344
If it was up to me,
I would gut this entire room,

422
00:18:56,448 --> 00:18:59,551
top to bottom, stem to stern,
clean slate.

423
00:18:59,655 --> 00:19:03,724
First to go,
those cabinets, huh? Yeah?

424
00:19:03,827 --> 00:19:06,793
- Right, well, we made a list.
- Oh.

425
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:08,000
I was waiting for it.

426
00:19:08,103 --> 00:19:09,389
I mean, it would've
been a surprise

427
00:19:09,413 --> 00:19:11,482
if Stella and Freddie
didn't gang up on me.

428
00:19:11,586 --> 00:19:12,586
Stealth attack.

429
00:19:12,689 --> 00:19:13,969
Okay, so maybe Freddie came over

430
00:19:14,034 --> 00:19:15,793
and we tossed around
a couple ideas

431
00:19:15,896 --> 00:19:17,310
over a bottle of wine,
no big deal.

432
00:19:17,413 --> 00:19:19,241
- Where was my invite?
- I don't know.

433
00:19:19,344 --> 00:19:21,172
I can... I can contribute.

434
00:19:21,275 --> 00:19:23,758
I would've brought
another bottle.

435
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:25,620
Stella has higher expectations

436
00:19:25,724 --> 00:19:29,172
than any homeowner
we've ever had on this show.

437
00:19:29,275 --> 00:19:31,241
This is gonna be
a nightmare job, nightmare.

438
00:19:31,344 --> 00:19:32,793
That's very rude.

439
00:19:32,896 --> 00:19:35,724
Well, if we manage to keep the
peace between now and Christmas,

440
00:19:35,827 --> 00:19:38,655
we may be able to pull this off.

441
00:19:38,758 --> 00:19:40,103
And cut!

442
00:19:40,206 --> 00:19:42,000
Okay, we got it.

443
00:19:42,103 --> 00:19:44,931
Guys... you guys can relax now.

444
00:19:45,034 --> 00:19:46,275
It's over.

445
00:19:47,931 --> 00:19:50,275
Stand down. Scene.

446
00:19:53,206 --> 00:19:56,275
Okay, so what's
the plan, Stella?

447
00:19:56,379 --> 00:19:57,779
Well, since we only
have four weeks,

448
00:19:57,862 --> 00:19:59,493
the scope of our work
is gonna be limited,

449
00:19:59,517 --> 00:20:01,689
so I suggest fresh
paint on the inside

450
00:20:01,793 --> 00:20:03,517
and refinishing the floors.

451
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,655
Yeah, the upstairs is
actually in pretty good shape.

452
00:20:06,758 --> 00:20:10,275
It's the, uh, downstairs public
rooms that give me nightmares.

453
00:20:10,379 --> 00:20:11,779
Yeah, well, that's
why I wanna focus

454
00:20:11,862 --> 00:20:14,379
the majority of our
attention and our budget

455
00:20:14,482 --> 00:20:17,758
on the dining room,
kitchen, and living room.

456
00:20:19,793 --> 00:20:22,103
In the dining room,
someone, over the years...

457
00:20:22,206 --> 00:20:23,448
Take a look at this...

458
00:20:23,551 --> 00:20:25,103
Ripped out the
original fireplace,

459
00:20:25,206 --> 00:20:26,896
the built-in cabinetry,

460
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,310
and the art glass windows.

461
00:20:29,413 --> 00:20:31,793
- I mean, what?
- Shame.

462
00:20:31,896 --> 00:20:33,336
We'll need to
restore the wainscoting

463
00:20:33,413 --> 00:20:35,482
and copper wood ceiling.

464
00:20:35,586 --> 00:20:37,448
And the original chandelier
is a fire hazard,

465
00:20:37,551 --> 00:20:39,172
so it's gonna need
to be rewired.

466
00:20:41,689 --> 00:20:44,241
The kitchen needs a ton of work.

467
00:20:44,344 --> 00:20:46,482
So Freddie and I
worked up a plan.

468
00:20:46,586 --> 00:20:48,620
First of all, we'll place
a copper farmhouse sink

469
00:20:48,724 --> 00:20:50,000
under the window,

470
00:20:50,103 --> 00:20:52,931
add a tile backsplash,
wood countertops,

471
00:20:53,034 --> 00:20:55,620
a six-burner stove,
convection oven,

472
00:20:55,724 --> 00:20:57,827
and a kitchen island here.

473
00:20:57,931 --> 00:20:59,103
Nice.

474
00:20:59,206 --> 00:21:02,241
Are we magicians or what?
I mean, we kind of are.

475
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:05,241
Turning to the living room,
zero character,

476
00:21:05,344 --> 00:21:07,034
- bad marble fireplace.
- Bad.

477
00:21:07,137 --> 00:21:09,206
Ugly, ugly walls.

478
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,655
We'll get rid of
the marble facing

479
00:21:10,758 --> 00:21:14,172
and replace it with
period-appropriate tile.

480
00:21:14,275 --> 00:21:17,655
The wood in the inglenook needs
a light sanding and oiling.

481
00:21:17,758 --> 00:21:21,896
And we'll add vintage wallpaper
to brighten up the room.

482
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,206
We've also lost
some crown moldings.

483
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:26,517
Uh, Gabe can mill those.
He'll do a perfect match.

484
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,413
- Aww, Gabe.
- Yeah.

485
00:21:28,517 --> 00:21:31,275
Where does all the
Christmas stuff go?

486
00:21:31,379 --> 00:21:33,931
That's the best part.
Christmas tree's gonna go here,

487
00:21:34,034 --> 00:21:36,448
and my mom still has
ornaments from 1910.

488
00:21:36,551 --> 00:21:39,068
Look at that.
Instant Christmas.

489
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:41,620
Instant Christmas.

490
00:21:42,965 --> 00:21:45,482
Long day.

491
00:21:45,586 --> 00:21:48,655
Jack? Jack? Jack? Hi!

492
00:21:48,758 --> 00:21:51,241
So, I talked to the network
about doing a corporate tie-in

493
00:21:51,344 --> 00:21:53,655
- with Turner and Klee.
- Yeah...?

494
00:21:53,758 --> 00:21:55,068
They were thrilled.

495
00:21:55,172 --> 00:21:56,379
- Great!
- That's awesome.

496
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:58,482
Thank you so much, Zoe.
This is great news.

497
00:21:58,586 --> 00:22:00,896
Such great PR for the new brand.

498
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,206
Ten percent.
I'll invoice you.

499
00:22:04,586 --> 00:22:06,103
I'm not joking.

500
00:22:06,206 --> 00:22:08,965
But I also want this house
to be perfect for my Stella.

501
00:22:09,068 --> 00:22:10,976
Yeah, yeah, we'll have to see if
there's anything left to paint

502
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,379
- after tomorrow.
- Wait, wait, why?

503
00:22:13,482 --> 00:22:14,758
- Demo day.
- Ahh...

504
00:22:14,862 --> 00:22:16,620
Now I know how
our homeowners feel.

505
00:22:16,724 --> 00:22:18,320
Oh, come on.
What's there to worry about?

506
00:22:18,344 --> 00:22:20,137
How much damage can
Pablo do in one day?

507
00:22:28,862 --> 00:22:30,103

Ah!

530
00:23:25,655 --> 00:23:27,217
We uncovered a little bit
of history this morning.

531
00:23:27,241 --> 00:23:29,655
Three layers of
dining room wallpaper.

532
00:23:29,758 --> 00:23:31,172
Look at that.

533
00:23:31,275 --> 00:23:33,655
Some people dream in color.
I dream in wallpaper.

534
00:23:33,758 --> 00:23:35,482
This is my favorite
room in the house.

535
00:23:35,586 --> 00:23:37,034
Guys, guys.

536
00:23:37,137 --> 00:23:39,310
Can you put a shirt on?
It's freezing outside.

537
00:23:39,413 --> 00:23:40,413
What is Gabe doing?

538
00:23:40,517 --> 00:23:43,344
I find the cold air
invigorating.

539
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,113
I suspect some of them
have been leaking

540
00:24:11,137 --> 00:24:13,275
for a very long time.

541
00:24:13,379 --> 00:24:16,275
I mean, yeah, this
is a lot of water.

542
00:24:16,379 --> 00:24:18,517
Oh, I mean, I knew
what I was getting into

543
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:21,206
when I bought the place as
is, but I just... I didn't...

544
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:24,206
I didn't expect this, Vern.
Should I be worried?

545
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:28,758
No, no, no.
Girl, I've seen worse.

546
00:24:28,862 --> 00:24:30,896
You're biting off a lot
with this project, Stella.

547
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,310
Are you sure you're okay?

548
00:24:32,413 --> 00:24:34,724
Yeah, I got a lot on my mind.
The wedding, the house.

549
00:24:34,827 --> 00:24:37,241
This might be our last season.

550
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:42,068
When the show ends, do you
know what you'll do next?

551
00:24:42,172 --> 00:24:43,344
I don't know.

552
00:24:43,448 --> 00:24:44,631
We talked about
expanding my brand.

553
00:24:44,655 --> 00:24:46,034
Maybe a furniture line.

554
00:24:46,137 --> 00:24:48,517
You ever think about finishing
your engineering program?

555
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,103
Sometimes. I did love it.

556
00:24:50,206 --> 00:24:52,827
But how could I ever
give up this glamorous life?

557
00:24:52,931 --> 00:24:54,344
Watch your back!

558
00:24:54,448 --> 00:24:56,000
That didn't sound good.

559
00:24:56,103 --> 00:24:58,275
Hey, have you been
talking to my mom?

560
00:24:58,379 --> 00:25:01,137
Who, by the way, is waiting
for me downtown at my fitting.

561
00:25:01,241 --> 00:25:05,103
I wish your father was here
to walk you down the aisle.

562
00:25:05,206 --> 00:25:09,655
Yeah, yeah. Me too.

563
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:12,793
I'm glad you're here, Vern.

564
00:25:12,896 --> 00:25:16,965
Stella, you're the only person
I'd come out of retirement for.

565
00:25:17,068 --> 00:25:18,862
The only one.

566
00:25:19,827 --> 00:25:21,627
Did Vern find any dead
bodies in the basement?

567
00:25:21,655 --> 00:25:23,896
Uh, maybe tomorrow.

568
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,448
I told Stella this was gonna be
more than a cosmetic makeover,

569
00:25:26,551 --> 00:25:28,689
but she's the eternal
optimist, right?

570
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:31,620
These old houses,
they're like a Pandora's box.

571
00:25:31,724 --> 00:25:34,379
If I had my way, we'd move
into my condo in Richmond.

572
00:25:34,482 --> 00:25:36,275
Views forever.

573
00:25:36,379 --> 00:25:38,931
Have you and Stella
talked about that?

574
00:25:39,034 --> 00:25:42,758
There's no talking about it.
This house means a lot to her.

575
00:25:42,862 --> 00:25:46,758
Still keeping my condo.
I'll rent it out or something.

576
00:25:46,862 --> 00:25:49,172
Or maybe I'll get her
to change her mind.

577
00:25:58,413 --> 00:26:00,413
So, how's everything
going with the house?

578
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:02,827
There were a few
surprises along the way.

579
00:26:02,931 --> 00:26:04,620
Bad news, Vern found some leaks.

580
00:26:04,724 --> 00:26:06,068
- Ah!
- Yeah.

581
00:26:06,172 --> 00:26:08,241
Good news, I discovered
some original wallpaper.

582
00:26:08,344 --> 00:26:09,596
I was actually hoping
maybe you could find

583
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,655
- some old photos to help us?
- Oh, sure.

584
00:26:11,758 --> 00:26:13,586
Boxes of stuff in my basement.

585
00:26:17,758 --> 00:26:20,793
Oh, Stella!

586
00:26:20,896 --> 00:26:22,793
Oh, honey.

587
00:26:22,896 --> 00:26:25,172
That is the one.

588
00:26:26,137 --> 00:26:27,689
What's going on?

589
00:26:27,793 --> 00:26:29,310
We were supposed
to pick up Stella.

590
00:26:29,413 --> 00:26:30,769
Guys! I thought
you were gonna meet us

591
00:26:30,793 --> 00:26:32,103
down at the stone yard.

592
00:26:32,206 --> 00:26:34,862
That deal was we're not shooting
any of the wedding stuff!

593
00:26:34,965 --> 00:26:37,310
Zoe probably wants to see
Zoe in her wedding dress.

594
00:26:37,413 --> 00:26:39,000
We gotta go warn her.

595
00:26:39,862 --> 00:26:43,344
Uh, hi, I'm here
for Stella Murphy?

596
00:26:43,448 --> 00:26:46,206
Oh, you must be the lucky groom!

597
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,596
- No, I'm, uh...
- You know you can't

598
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,079
see her in her dress
until the big day.

599
00:26:49,103 --> 00:26:50,862
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm just, um...

600
00:26:50,965 --> 00:26:52,724
I'm Pablo.
I need to talk to her.

601
00:26:52,827 --> 00:26:55,689
The two of you look like
you belong together.

602
00:26:55,793 --> 00:26:57,827
Right?
A match made in heaven.

603
00:26:57,931 --> 00:27:00,413
Uh, Stella needs to talk.
Just two seconds.

604
00:27:00,517 --> 00:27:02,862
No, but seriously,
you can't see her right now.

605
00:27:02,965 --> 00:27:05,413
Thank you.

606
00:27:05,517 --> 00:27:07,448
Guys, no, really!

607
00:27:07,551 --> 00:27:09,275
- Stel?
- Miss Murphy?

608
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:12,034
I'm so sorry, but,
um, your fiancé, he...

609
00:27:12,137 --> 00:27:14,689
I told her I wasn't
husband material, but...

610
00:27:15,724 --> 00:27:16,931
Pablo?

611
00:27:25,586 --> 00:27:27,344
Well...

612
00:27:28,241 --> 00:27:32,793
Um, uh, Zoe's got a
camera crew outside.

613
00:27:32,896 --> 00:27:35,758
- What?
- Yeah.

614
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:37,310
Let me change.

615
00:27:39,689 --> 00:27:41,931
Give me a minute.

616
00:27:42,034 --> 00:27:44,206
I should've known Zoe
was gonna do this.

617
00:27:46,034 --> 00:27:48,034
Wow, she looks incredible.

618
00:27:50,344 --> 00:27:53,310
You okay?

619
00:27:53,413 --> 00:27:55,793
Yeah.

620
00:27:55,896 --> 00:27:57,103
And, action!

621
00:27:57,206 --> 00:27:59,034
So when I was
taking the wallpaper off

622
00:27:59,137 --> 00:28:02,206
the dining room wall, I noticed
that there was something hiding.

623
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:04,482
Like, there was three
layers in one section,

624
00:28:04,586 --> 00:28:07,379
and just one layer in another
section, like it was newer.

625
00:28:12,448 --> 00:28:16,379
It was there all along...
The elephant in the room.

626
00:28:18,586 --> 00:28:20,344
The false wall.

627
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:23,586
Whoo!

628
00:28:24,413 --> 00:28:27,241
I knew it.
It's the fireplace.

629
00:28:31,724 --> 00:28:34,379
In older homes, some
people put up a false wall

630
00:28:34,482 --> 00:28:36,896
rather than do a proper remodel.

631
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,931
Who in their right mind would
ever cover up a fireplace?

632
00:28:40,034 --> 00:28:43,620
- And take out art glass windows?
- Right.

633
00:28:43,724 --> 00:28:47,862
- Um... what is this?
- I don't know.

634
00:28:47,965 --> 00:28:51,758
A block of concrete?
There used to be cabinets here.

635
00:28:51,862 --> 00:28:54,344
My grandma would keep
napkin holders and red candles.

636
00:28:54,448 --> 00:28:57,620
She always had red candles
for the holidays.

637
00:28:57,724 --> 00:29:00,137
Yeah...

638
00:29:00,241 --> 00:29:01,689
Weird.

639
00:29:03,034 --> 00:29:04,275
Something back there.

640
00:29:04,379 --> 00:29:07,379
I don't wanna put
my hand in there. Aah!

641
00:29:07,482 --> 00:29:09,310
What is this?

642
00:29:14,793 --> 00:29:18,793
Okay. That's... ee.

643
00:29:23,206 --> 00:29:26,586
- What are those for?
- I have no clue.

644
00:29:33,931 --> 00:29:36,344
So this afternoon, we're heading
to Heirloom Antique Emporium

645
00:29:36,448 --> 00:29:39,551
in search of some furniture
for the new house.

646
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:43,724
Everybody, I want you to meet
my wonderful friend Andy.

647
00:29:43,827 --> 00:29:45,551
We've known each other
since fifth grade.

648
00:29:45,655 --> 00:29:47,827
He owns the place, and is
going to help me and Jack

649
00:29:47,931 --> 00:29:49,517
find a dining room table.

650
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,413
So I have curated
a list of furniture

651
00:29:51,517 --> 00:29:52,758
from the photos that you sent.

652
00:29:52,862 --> 00:29:55,206
I think I found
a dining room set

653
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:58,206
that is going to blow you away.

654
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:00,689
Hey, Stella, come look at this.

655
00:30:04,448 --> 00:30:05,827
What do you think?

656
00:30:05,931 --> 00:30:08,517
Gorgeous, but it's a little
Dwellmagazine for 1910,

657
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,241
don't you think?

658
00:30:10,344 --> 00:30:12,965
- I think it's eclectic.
- Oh...

659
00:30:13,068 --> 00:30:14,931
I mean, Pablo,
what do you think?

660
00:30:15,034 --> 00:30:17,103
Uh, not my department.

661
00:30:17,206 --> 00:30:20,034
Why don't we go look at
some Arts and Crafts pieces,

662
00:30:20,137 --> 00:30:21,551
split the difference?
All right?

663
00:30:21,655 --> 00:30:23,310
- Sure.
- All right, follow me.

664
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
When we finish it,
we'll sand it down...

665
00:30:28,103 --> 00:30:29,700
Honey, I've got a couple
urgent calls to return.

666
00:30:29,724 --> 00:30:31,068
I'm just gonna step outside.

667
00:30:31,172 --> 00:30:34,000
Oh, I... you don't wanna
check out the table with me?

668
00:30:34,103 --> 00:30:36,379
Uh, it looks good.
I trust you, babe.

669
00:30:36,482 --> 00:30:38,413
Honestly, it's...
It's not my style.

670
00:30:38,517 --> 00:30:39,724
It's a little old, anyway.

671
00:30:39,827 --> 00:30:41,493
Yeah, I know, but
I think it'd be really nice

672
00:30:41,517 --> 00:30:43,103
if we did this together.

673
00:30:43,206 --> 00:30:46,586
I want you to feel just as much
at home in this house as I do.

674
00:30:46,689 --> 00:30:49,344
Take some pictures,
we'll talk about it later, okay?

675
00:30:49,448 --> 00:30:51,206
- Jack...
- I'm sorry.

676
00:30:59,034 --> 00:31:01,827
Um, okay, so what's
the length of this table?

677
00:31:05,068 --> 00:31:06,482
We're also lending Andy a hand

678
00:31:06,586 --> 00:31:09,310
for the city's annual
Christmas toy drive.

679
00:31:09,413 --> 00:31:11,010
Children and antiques
all in one afternoon?

680
00:31:11,034 --> 00:31:14,275
It's an absolute miracle
that I got Pablo to go.

681
00:31:14,379 --> 00:31:17,241
I'm just not a
big Christmas guy,

682
00:31:17,344 --> 00:31:18,758
and I hate antiques.

683
00:31:18,862 --> 00:31:21,586
Well, let's see if we
can tame the Grinch today.

684
00:31:21,689 --> 00:31:23,896
Oh, come on, you
look fetching in red.

685
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,172
The kids are gonna love it.

686
00:31:25,275 --> 00:31:26,931
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.

687
00:31:27,034 --> 00:31:29,241
- Stop being a Grinch.
- I'm not a Grinch.

688
00:31:29,344 --> 00:31:30,624
Yeah, okay, but
wait, wait, wait.

689
00:31:30,689 --> 00:31:32,389
Let me just... here, let
me help with the belt.

690
00:31:32,413 --> 00:31:34,344
- It's, like, all crooked.
- Thanks.

691
00:31:34,448 --> 00:31:37,862
- Oh, okay... oh!
- Whoa! Kay... ha, ha.

692
00:31:37,965 --> 00:31:39,965
Oh my goodness,
is that you or the stuffing?

693
00:31:40,068 --> 00:31:43,172
Yeah, it's all me.
Careful with the merchandise.

694
00:31:43,275 --> 00:31:45,965
- Oh. Okay.
- Thank you.

695
00:31:47,206 --> 00:31:49,103
There we go. Perfect.

696
00:31:52,413 --> 00:31:53,724
Okay, all right.

697
00:31:55,586 --> 00:31:58,724
The North Pole
is officially open!

698
00:32:06,413 --> 00:32:07,862
You're next.

699
00:32:08,896 --> 00:32:12,344
- Okay!
- I love you, Santa.

700
00:32:12,448 --> 00:32:15,068
That's enough hugging for today.

701
00:32:15,172 --> 00:32:16,586
No, you can hug
him all you want.

702
00:32:16,689 --> 00:32:17,969
Deep down, Santa
really likes it.

703
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
He's a real big marshmallow.

704
00:32:20,103 --> 00:32:22,896
- Oh, is that so?
- Yeah, totally.

705
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,724
After all these
years of marriage,

706
00:32:24,827 --> 00:32:26,758
I know you pretty well, Santa.

707
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:28,517
I'm gonna tell you
what I want now.

708
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,137
Okay.

709
00:32:30,241 --> 00:32:34,379
I want a dinosaur!
Tyrannosaurus rex.

710
00:32:34,482 --> 00:32:37,344
- They're my favorite.
- Yeah, me too.

711
00:32:37,448 --> 00:32:39,241
I'll work on that.
All right, who's next?

712
00:32:39,344 --> 00:32:41,000
You, young lady
in the puffy jacket.

713
00:32:41,103 --> 00:32:44,551
I don't think she's done, Santa.
Sweetie, what's your name?

714
00:32:44,655 --> 00:32:46,862
- Mary.
- Mary?

715
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:51,379
Mary, why don't you tell
Santa everything you want?

716
00:32:51,482 --> 00:32:55,827
I want a Harry Potter
wand for my sister.

717
00:32:55,931 --> 00:33:01,931
- And... and a job for my father.
- A job?

718
00:33:03,137 --> 00:33:05,965
Ah, I'm sorry, Santa.
That's not on the list.

719
00:33:06,068 --> 00:33:07,551
Why not, Daddy?

720
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:12,413
- Did I say something wrong?
- No, no, no, no.

721
00:33:12,517 --> 00:33:14,413
Santa Claus.
What's your name?

722
00:33:14,517 --> 00:33:16,586
- Gregg.
- Gregg, good to meet you.

723
00:33:16,689 --> 00:33:19,793
Um, so what's the situation?

724
00:33:19,896 --> 00:33:21,724
I'm just kind of in
between jobs right now.

725
00:33:21,827 --> 00:33:23,310
I've been there too.
It's no fun.

726
00:33:23,413 --> 00:33:26,137
- What do you do?
- Uh, I'm a housepainter.

727
00:33:26,241 --> 00:33:27,896
- Really? A painter?
- Mm-hmm.

728
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,724
He painted stars
on my bedroom ceiling.

729
00:33:30,827 --> 00:33:33,241
- Really?
- He did? Wow.

730
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:34,551
You like bedtime stories?

731
00:33:34,655 --> 00:33:35,896
I do.

732
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,931
Okay, well,
I have one specially for you.

733
00:33:41,034 --> 00:33:44,172
So there's this really old house

734
00:33:44,275 --> 00:33:47,413
owned by a very lovely lady.

735
00:33:47,517 --> 00:33:50,620
Well, sometimes she can get
a little crusty with her cohost.

736
00:33:50,724 --> 00:33:53,620
- What's a cohost?
- Uh, never mind.

737
00:33:53,724 --> 00:33:57,379
Anyway, this lovely lady
has a magical power.

738
00:33:57,482 --> 00:33:59,413
She can turn the ugliest
house on the block

739
00:33:59,517 --> 00:34:02,551
into a beautiful castle.

740
00:34:02,655 --> 00:34:06,620
But she needs help with
one thing at this house.

741
00:34:06,724 --> 00:34:08,655
What's that?

742
00:34:08,758 --> 00:34:11,344
Paint.

743
00:34:11,448 --> 00:34:16,448
And if your dad can paint stars
on the ceiling of your room,

744
00:34:16,551 --> 00:34:20,034
well, then Santa thinks
that'd be a really cool idea

745
00:34:20,137 --> 00:34:24,758
if he helped the lovely lady
with the magical home.

746
00:34:24,862 --> 00:34:26,793
- What do you think?
- Mm-hmm.

747
00:34:26,896 --> 00:34:27,896
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

748
00:34:27,931 --> 00:34:29,482
- All right, let's do it.
- Yeah!

749
00:34:29,586 --> 00:34:34,206
I'll call Rudolph and the elves
and make that happen, all right?

750
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:37,103
- Mm-hmm.
- Sounds good. Let's do that.

751
00:34:41,482 --> 00:34:45,241
- Amazing stuff.
- Yeah, we had a good time.

752
00:34:45,344 --> 00:34:47,010
Everyone had a good time.
Especially the kids.

753
00:34:47,034 --> 00:34:48,931
Oh, I'm not talking
about the kids.

754
00:34:49,034 --> 00:34:50,655
You and Pablo?
Did you see that?

755
00:34:50,758 --> 00:34:52,482
You two were flirting
with each other.

756
00:34:52,586 --> 00:34:54,137
Okay, that is ridiculous.

757
00:34:54,241 --> 00:34:56,275
It was just another
day at the office.

758
00:34:56,379 --> 00:34:59,482
I know, I can feel
the tension from here.

759
00:34:59,586 --> 00:35:01,079
Maybe the wedding's getting
to him a little bit.

760
00:35:01,103 --> 00:35:02,493
No, the wedding's
not getting to him.

761
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,896
There was no flirting.
It was just working.

762
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,379
Okay!

763
00:35:06,482 --> 00:35:07,551
We're ready for Stella!

764
00:35:07,655 --> 00:35:08,907
Oh, okay, they're
ready for you on set.

765
00:35:08,931 --> 00:35:11,000
- Okay.
- Van, you don't need to yell.

766
00:35:12,482 --> 00:35:15,034
My fiancé, Jack Hall,
has generously volunteered

767
00:35:15,137 --> 00:35:17,448
his services and all
the Turner and Klee paint

768
00:35:17,551 --> 00:35:20,344
that you could ever
want for the makeover.

769
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:22,551
Salmon in Aspic.

770
00:35:22,655 --> 00:35:24,724
Can you do this
with the gloss on it?

771
00:35:24,827 --> 00:35:27,241
So paint is a hot topic
here at House Sweet Home.

772
00:35:27,344 --> 00:35:28,517
It's the great divider.

773
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:31,620
You guys can get
pretty feisty online.

774
00:35:31,724 --> 00:35:34,655
In a house where the
wood has gone unpainted

775
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:37,034
for over 110 years,

776
00:35:37,137 --> 00:35:41,206
my instinct is to follow
tradition and leave it stained.

777
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:44,896
Let's ask Jack, since he's
our official paint connoisseur.

778
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,206
I suggest the
neutral semi-gloss.

779
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:49,931
We make a classic ecru
that's period correct,

780
00:35:50,034 --> 00:35:51,758
but it's contemporary.

781
00:35:51,862 --> 00:35:55,241
Okay, well I just...
I love the warmth of the wood.

782
00:35:55,344 --> 00:35:58,344
Ooh, Stella, this place
is so over the top.

783
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:00,655
I mean, all the ornamentation?

784
00:36:00,758 --> 00:36:02,137
It's like icing
on a wedding cake.

785
00:36:02,241 --> 00:36:04,448
And you know how much
I hate wedding cakes.

786
00:36:04,551 --> 00:36:07,827
No, I-I don't.

787
00:36:07,931 --> 00:36:10,275
Oh, well,
just the froufrou kind.

788
00:36:10,379 --> 00:36:13,137
You know, the ones with,
uh, buttercream garland

789
00:36:13,241 --> 00:36:14,965
and marzipan roses.

790
00:36:15,068 --> 00:36:17,931
I mean, who needs to eat
all that sugar, right?

791
00:36:18,034 --> 00:36:20,206
I do.

792
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:23,344
Okay, so it's decision
time on the paint, guys,

793
00:36:23,448 --> 00:36:24,848
'cause I'm not gonna
be living here,

794
00:36:24,931 --> 00:36:28,413
- but you two are.
- Jack?

795
00:36:28,517 --> 00:36:30,413
Well, as the paint dude,
I'm gonna advocate

796
00:36:30,517 --> 00:36:34,103
for as much paint as possible.

797
00:36:34,206 --> 00:36:35,551
I like the wood.

798
00:36:38,793 --> 00:36:41,034
- Hey, you heading to base camp?
- Yeah.

799
00:36:41,137 --> 00:36:43,310
I'll come with you.
What's wrong?

800
00:36:43,413 --> 00:36:45,517
Nothing.

801
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,586
Jack.

802
00:36:47,689 --> 00:36:49,217
Wasn't there to help
pick out the furniture,

803
00:36:49,241 --> 00:36:51,000
he was weird about
the wedding cake.

804
00:36:51,103 --> 00:36:52,689
Now this whole paint thing.

805
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:55,000
Okay, don't pay any
attention to Jack.

806
00:36:55,103 --> 00:36:57,413
Jack doesn't even pay
attention to himself.

807
00:36:57,517 --> 00:36:59,241
Jack pays attention to himself.

808
00:36:59,344 --> 00:37:00,965
Is that a little bit
of shade I sense?

809
00:37:01,068 --> 00:37:02,562
He clearly doesn't
care about the house.

810
00:37:02,586 --> 00:37:04,769
Meanwhile, Stella's been pouring
her heart and soul into it.

811
00:37:04,793 --> 00:37:08,068
I just don't... get their
relationship, that's all.

812
00:37:08,172 --> 00:37:09,655
Hey, none of us do.

813
00:37:09,758 --> 00:37:11,517
You're getting yourself
worked up over this.

814
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,655
No. No, I'm not.

815
00:37:13,758 --> 00:37:15,827
Okay. You seem
a little bit worked up.

816
00:37:15,931 --> 00:37:17,344
No, I'm not!

817
00:37:31,586 --> 00:37:32,862
Hey, Maggie.

818
00:37:32,965 --> 00:37:35,862
Ah, I knew I'd find
you in the shop.

819
00:37:35,965 --> 00:37:37,689
Big surprise.

820
00:37:37,793 --> 00:37:40,793
So, how are things
on Home Buy 101?

821
00:37:40,896 --> 00:37:44,448
We just got a two-season pickup
and we're moving to streaming.

822
00:37:44,551 --> 00:37:46,482
Yeah, I know!

823
00:37:46,586 --> 00:37:49,724
I don't want you poaching
anyone from my show, okay, Mags?

824
00:37:49,827 --> 00:37:53,068
They've given me a blind deal
for a new show, Pablo.

825
00:37:53,172 --> 00:37:55,724
We're calling it
Bungalow Lifestyles.

826
00:37:55,827 --> 00:37:58,689
No more of those dusty old
houses Stella likes so much.

827
00:37:58,793 --> 00:38:00,862
Stella's got her opinions,

828
00:38:00,965 --> 00:38:04,103
but that's what makes
our chemistry work, right?

829
00:38:04,206 --> 00:38:05,413
We talked about

830
00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:07,379
you executive producing
your own show.

831
00:38:07,482 --> 00:38:10,002
What about coming on to the team
and buildingBungalow Lifestyles

832
00:38:10,034 --> 00:38:11,620
from the ground up?

833
00:38:11,724 --> 00:38:14,275
Wow, okay, that's,
uh, quite an offer.

834
00:38:14,379 --> 00:38:16,448
Stella and I would have to talk.

835
00:38:16,551 --> 00:38:21,241
As much as I love Stella,
we're thinking a single host.

836
00:38:21,344 --> 00:38:23,724
Your show, your vision.

837
00:38:23,827 --> 00:38:26,758
Uh... okay.

838
00:38:26,862 --> 00:38:29,068
Just know there's
a place for you here.

839
00:38:29,172 --> 00:38:31,206
Let's stay in touch?

840
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:33,655
Yeah. Stay in touch.

841
00:38:33,758 --> 00:38:35,517
Talk to you soon.

842
00:38:48,172 --> 00:38:49,655
Shoot!

843
00:39:03,275 --> 00:39:05,413
Pablo?
Can I use your level?

844
00:39:09,137 --> 00:39:11,379
I never noticed the floor
was sagging in this room.

845
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:13,689
It's like an inch out of level.

846
00:39:13,793 --> 00:39:17,448
- Uh, might be the joists.
- Ugh!

847
00:39:17,551 --> 00:39:19,689
I'll go underneath
and check later.

848
00:39:19,793 --> 00:39:22,344
Stella, I found a
great wedding photographer

849
00:39:22,448 --> 00:39:26,379
who can do the 24th.
A classic black and white.

850
00:39:26,482 --> 00:39:29,275
That's awesome.
Thanks, Mom.

851
00:39:29,379 --> 00:39:33,793
Oh, hey, I have a question.
Do you recognize these at all?

852
00:39:33,896 --> 00:39:38,068
I found them in the dining room
by the fireplace?

853
00:39:38,172 --> 00:39:39,724
- Look at these.
- Oh, oh!

854
00:39:39,827 --> 00:39:43,275
I know what these are.
My mom told me all about these.

855
00:39:43,379 --> 00:39:45,965
- These are the Santa keys.
- Santa keys?

856
00:39:46,068 --> 00:39:47,588
Yeah, Santa can't
fit down the chimney,

857
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:48,803
or if your house
doesn't have one,

858
00:39:48,827 --> 00:39:50,044
there's no way
for him to get in.

859
00:39:50,068 --> 00:39:51,448
So back in the days,

860
00:39:51,551 --> 00:39:53,862
you put one of these on
the porch on Christmas Eve.

861
00:39:53,965 --> 00:39:55,931
- That is so cute.
- Isn't it?

862
00:39:56,034 --> 00:39:57,482
Your great-great-grandmother
had one

863
00:39:57,586 --> 00:40:00,344
- for each of the 12 kids.
- Aw, I love that.

864
00:40:00,448 --> 00:40:02,482
- I wanna do that.
- You should do it.

865
00:40:02,586 --> 00:40:07,241
Yeah. Well, hey, I can
keep them someplace safe, huh?

866
00:40:07,344 --> 00:40:08,758
Okay.

867
00:40:09,827 --> 00:40:12,137
We will have the kitchen
up and running for the 24th,

868
00:40:12,241 --> 00:40:14,896
so if you could just
email me that revised menu,

869
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,689
- that'd be great.
- Sure, no problem.

870
00:40:16,793 --> 00:40:19,310
Yep, which brings me
to the, uh, wedding cake.

871
00:40:19,413 --> 00:40:21,217
- Stella, camera's here.
- Yeah, just one second.

872
00:40:21,241 --> 00:40:25,000
Yeah, I need something
more basic, stripped down.

873
00:40:25,103 --> 00:40:29,586
Uh, think postmodernism meets
cubism meets a bar of soap.

874
00:40:29,689 --> 00:40:31,206
You kidding?

875
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:34,310
Nope, I'm actually not joking
at all, not even a little bit.

876
00:40:34,413 --> 00:40:38,103
Yeah, um, okay.
Yes, okay, yes!

877
00:40:38,206 --> 00:40:40,517
Thanks a million.
Thank you.

878
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:43,965
What... What's going on?

879
00:40:44,068 --> 00:40:46,793
You know how I said
I'd check on the joists?

880
00:40:46,896 --> 00:40:49,655
Yeah. Don't tell me
there's termites.

881
00:40:49,758 --> 00:40:51,724
I wish that's all it was.

882
00:40:51,827 --> 00:40:55,137
There's a crack
in the foundation.

883
00:40:55,241 --> 00:40:56,448
- What?
- Yeah.

884
00:40:56,551 --> 00:40:58,182
Looks like the east side
of the host is sinking.

885
00:40:58,206 --> 00:41:00,896
We need to get an
expert in here ASAP.

886
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
- Is it safe?
- Yeah, for now.

887
00:41:04,103 --> 00:41:05,758
But over time, no.

888
00:41:05,862 --> 00:41:07,079
I can't believe
this is happening.

889
00:41:07,103 --> 00:41:08,551
I should've known about this.

890
00:41:08,655 --> 00:41:10,458
No, no, there's no way you
could've known about that.

891
00:41:10,482 --> 00:41:12,172
What about the show?
Can we keep shooting?

892
00:41:12,275 --> 00:41:13,965
I mean, the show can go on,

893
00:41:14,068 --> 00:41:16,206
but there won't be much to
shoot.

894
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:18,562
My crew can't pick up a hammer
until we get building clearance,

895
00:41:18,586 --> 00:41:20,172
and the inspection...

896
00:41:22,758 --> 00:41:25,931
- Sorry, Stella.
- I'm sorry.

897
00:41:41,103 --> 00:41:43,034
Are you okay?

898
00:41:43,137 --> 00:41:46,241
Uh, yeah.

899
00:41:46,344 --> 00:41:50,034
I'm just getting in
the spirit over here.

900
00:41:52,379 --> 00:41:55,206
I thought you were meeting Jack?

901
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:59,448
No, he's in Richmond
for the night.

902
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:04,965
- Did you tell him?
- No.

903
00:42:05,068 --> 00:42:07,034
No, I didn't.

904
00:42:10,172 --> 00:42:13,172
After we wrapped today,
I was thinking...

905
00:42:13,275 --> 00:42:14,941
do you know what this
house could really use

906
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:17,586
other than a new foundation?

907
00:42:17,689 --> 00:42:19,448
Some Christmas cheer.

908
00:42:19,551 --> 00:42:22,793
So here I am.

909
00:42:22,896 --> 00:42:27,862
Well... you need a hand?

910
00:42:27,965 --> 00:42:30,655
- Um, yeah.
- All right.

911
00:42:30,758 --> 00:42:33,448
All right, I'd love one.
Here, why don't you do

912
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:34,793
- that tree.
- This tree?

913
00:42:34,896 --> 00:42:37,551
- Yeah.
- Okay.

914
00:42:41,931 --> 00:42:43,724
Uh...

915
00:42:49,758 --> 00:42:51,793
You'd think after
five Christmas episodes

916
00:42:51,896 --> 00:42:56,724
that this Grinch would know
how to thid old tree thing.

917
00:42:58,724 --> 00:43:00,241
Pablo?

918
00:43:03,448 --> 00:43:06,655
Do you think
I'm making a huge mistake?

919
00:43:10,586 --> 00:43:12,655
A lot of people have
cold feet before a wedding.

920
00:43:12,758 --> 00:43:18,655
No, I'm talking about the house.
Like, why am I doing this?

921
00:43:21,896 --> 00:43:25,517
Because you wanna
feel connected to...

922
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:28,379
something or someone who...

923
00:43:28,482 --> 00:43:30,344
You love this place.

924
00:43:30,448 --> 00:43:33,206
Yeah, and Jack would rather
us move into his loft

925
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:35,758
with this polished
concrete and steel and...

926
00:43:35,862 --> 00:43:40,000
You told me that you were
happiest when you were here.

927
00:43:40,103 --> 00:43:45,344
And isn't that what's important?

928
00:43:47,103 --> 00:43:49,793
- You remember me saying that?
- Of course.

929
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,793
Well, I'm questioning
everything.

930
00:44:02,586 --> 00:44:07,103
- Maybe that's a good thing.
- I don't know.

931
00:44:07,206 --> 00:44:09,000
Is it?

932
00:44:21,103 --> 00:44:22,943
We just finished the
final edit this afternoon.

933
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,482
You are going to love it.

934
00:44:24,586 --> 00:44:26,379
We're already live
on the website.

935
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,068
Jack Hall here with
Turner and Klee Paint.

936
00:44:30,172 --> 00:44:33,448
I recently teamed up with my
brilliant and talented fiancée,

937
00:44:33,551 --> 00:44:35,724
interior designer Stella Murphy,

938
00:44:35,827 --> 00:44:37,724
and the cast ofHouse Sweet Home

939
00:44:37,827 --> 00:44:39,344
on their upcoming
Christmas episode.

940
00:44:39,448 --> 00:44:41,048
And you won't believe
the Christmas magic

941
00:44:41,137 --> 00:44:42,793
we created together.

942
00:44:42,896 --> 00:44:45,689
Don't limit yourself to just red
and green this holiday season.

943
00:44:45,793 --> 00:44:47,137
The sky's the limit.

944
00:44:47,241 --> 00:44:49,586
Turner and Klee will change
the way you see the world.

945
00:44:53,862 --> 00:44:55,758
So? What did you think?

946
00:44:55,862 --> 00:44:56,931
Zoe's right!

947
00:44:57,034 --> 00:44:59,448
You can sell
just about anything.

948
00:44:59,551 --> 00:45:01,896
Oh, come on, this
benefits everyone.

949
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,413
And like you haven't done 10,000
commercials for your show.

950
00:45:05,517 --> 00:45:06,517
This is different.

951
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:08,000
Zoe cleared it with the network,

952
00:45:08,103 --> 00:45:10,103
and they thought it
was a fantastic idea.

953
00:45:10,206 --> 00:45:11,424
And, I mean, the synergy alone...

954
00:45:11,448 --> 00:45:15,034
Why didn't you just
show it to me first?

955
00:45:15,137 --> 00:45:16,655
Well, with all
you had on your mind,

956
00:45:16,758 --> 00:45:18,034
I just didn't wanna bother you.

957
00:45:18,137 --> 00:45:19,344
I just...

958
00:45:19,448 --> 00:45:21,689
I wish you would've
said something earlier.

959
00:45:21,793 --> 00:45:23,827
With all this information
with the house,

960
00:45:23,931 --> 00:45:28,172
I don't even know if
we're gonna finish the episode.

961
00:45:28,275 --> 00:45:29,689
I didn't think
it was a big deal.

962
00:45:29,793 --> 00:45:31,172
But you're right.

963
00:45:31,275 --> 00:45:33,275
I'm sorry, Stella.
I should've showed you.

964
00:45:33,379 --> 00:45:34,448
I'll take it down.

965
00:45:34,551 --> 00:45:36,689
Let me go talk to
Zoe about it, okay?

966
00:45:43,275 --> 00:45:45,655
Oh, hey! You're just in time
to help me make dinner.

967
00:45:45,758 --> 00:45:47,010
Oh no, I'm just
grabbing the ornaments.

968
00:45:47,034 --> 00:45:48,586
I'm gonna head out.

969
00:45:48,689 --> 00:45:50,000
What... what's going on?

970
00:45:50,103 --> 00:45:52,275
Um...

971
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,931
I'm having second thoughts.

972
00:45:59,034 --> 00:46:01,724
- About?
- Everything.

973
00:46:04,482 --> 00:46:06,458
You know, there's nothing
wrong with feeling confused.

974
00:46:06,482 --> 00:46:07,758
Yeah, there is.

975
00:46:07,862 --> 00:46:11,068
I'm the one that's supposed
to have it all together.

976
00:46:11,172 --> 00:46:12,862
Maybe you're supposed
to sit in this.

977
00:46:12,965 --> 00:46:16,206
- It's a gray area.
- I don't do gray, Mom.

978
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:22,655
I just wish I had never
agreed to any of this.

979
00:46:24,827 --> 00:46:26,241
- I'll see you later.
- Bye.

980
00:46:26,344 --> 00:46:28,103
- I love you.
- I love you.

981
00:46:40,310 --> 00:46:42,344
- Hello!
- Hey, you!

982
00:46:42,448 --> 00:46:43,448
What are you doing here?

983
00:46:43,482 --> 00:46:45,206
Uh, Zoe said we were gonna prep

984
00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:49,000
for the cast and crew
Christmas party tomorrow? You?

985
00:46:49,103 --> 00:46:50,389
She told me she wanted
to talk about

986
00:46:50,413 --> 00:46:51,620
the tree decorating segment,

987
00:46:51,724 --> 00:46:53,517
so I brought over
some ornaments.

988
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:55,379
Um, should I text her?

989
00:46:55,482 --> 00:46:58,275
No, no, no, no, I'm
enjoying my peace and quiet.

990
00:46:58,379 --> 00:47:00,758
- Those are amazing.
- Yeah.

991
00:47:00,862 --> 00:47:02,582
When I was a kid,
we had a decorating party,

992
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:04,300
and we would talk about
where they're from.

993
00:47:04,344 --> 00:47:06,310
Each ornament has its own story.

994
00:47:06,413 --> 00:47:10,103
Hm, what's the
story on this one?

995
00:47:10,206 --> 00:47:13,758
That one my dad got at the
Christmas Market in Salzburg.

996
00:47:13,862 --> 00:47:14,862
What about you?

997
00:47:14,931 --> 00:47:16,217
What kind of tree
did your family do?

998
00:47:16,241 --> 00:47:17,689
Do? We didn't...

999
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:21,000
We definitely didn't do
ornaments from Salzburg.

1000
00:47:21,103 --> 00:47:23,586
Uh, we didn't have much.

1001
00:47:23,689 --> 00:47:26,448
My grandpa was all about gifts
that were found or made.

1002
00:47:26,551 --> 00:47:29,931
I love that!
That's such a great idea.

1003
00:47:30,034 --> 00:47:31,275
Mm, in theory.

1004
00:47:31,379 --> 00:47:33,413
But when you're a kid
hoping for a baseball glove

1005
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:35,034
and your little brother gets you

1006
00:47:35,137 --> 00:47:39,793
a shoelace that he found on
the sidewalk, it's not so great.

1007
00:47:39,896 --> 00:47:42,620
Found or made, isn't that
what Christmas is all about?

1008
00:47:42,724 --> 00:47:48,000
Yeah, in an ideal world,
but that's not where we live.

1009
00:47:49,896 --> 00:47:52,931
- Are you hungry?
- I am starving.

1010
00:47:53,034 --> 00:47:55,620
- I forgot to eat dinner.
- Who forgets to eat?

1011
00:47:55,724 --> 00:47:57,413
- Pablo forgets to eat.
- Okay.

1012
00:47:57,517 --> 00:47:59,355
Well, I think the caterer
left some stuff in the kitchen.

1013
00:47:59,379 --> 00:48:00,413
- You down?
- So down,

1014
00:48:00,517 --> 00:48:02,172
- and I got a bottle of Pinot.
- Ooh!

1015
00:48:02,275 --> 00:48:05,724
- For a special occasion.
- What's the special occasion?

1016
00:48:05,827 --> 00:48:08,482
No cameras, no boom, no Zoe.

1017
00:48:10,103 --> 00:48:11,448
Yeah, celebrate.

1018
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:23,310
- Aw! It's like a picnic!
- Yeah.

1019
00:48:23,413 --> 00:48:25,655
Oh, this'll make it better.

1020
00:48:26,586 --> 00:48:27,965
Huh?

1021
00:48:28,068 --> 00:48:32,068
Oh, this house is
so beautiful at night.

1022
00:48:32,172 --> 00:48:34,413
Yeah, it is.
And hey, don't worry.

1023
00:48:34,517 --> 00:48:36,793
We're gonna get this
project back on track.

1024
00:48:36,896 --> 00:48:38,176
We've never had an episode tank,

1025
00:48:38,275 --> 00:48:42,206
and we're not gonna
let you down now.

1026
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:45,034
Yeah, well, if we get canceled,
at least we go out with a bang.

1027
00:48:45,137 --> 00:48:48,000
Don't even say that, okay?

1028
00:48:49,482 --> 00:48:51,517
It's true, Pablo.
Have you even thought about it?

1029
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:52,965
Like, what would you do?

1030
00:48:53,068 --> 00:48:57,862
Um, I'm not sure. You?

1031
00:48:57,965 --> 00:49:03,000
I don't know, but I'm just ready
to reinvent my life, you know?

1032
00:49:03,103 --> 00:49:06,931
Stel, I think you're gonna
love living in this house.

1033
00:49:07,034 --> 00:49:09,862
You can put a little
rocking chair in that corner,

1034
00:49:09,965 --> 00:49:11,275
lit by candlelight.

1035
00:49:11,379 --> 00:49:15,103
Yeah, and you could come visit
on your souped-up Harley.

1036
00:49:15,206 --> 00:49:17,166
How did you know I was
wanting a souped-up Harley?

1037
00:49:17,206 --> 00:49:19,724
Season 2, episode 7.
The Bucket List.

1038
00:49:19,827 --> 00:49:22,034
- You know me too well.
- Of course I do.

1039
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:30,206
♪ Until we make things bright

1040
00:49:30,310 --> 00:49:32,241
Um, I wanted to
show you something.

1041
00:49:34,965 --> 00:49:37,241
My mom found some
old photos of the house.

1042
00:49:41,448 --> 00:49:44,448
Oh, this is...
This is incredible.

1043
00:49:44,551 --> 00:49:45,931
How old are these?

1044
00:49:46,034 --> 00:49:48,034
Hold on...

1045
00:49:48,137 --> 00:49:52,034
that's where the dining
room windows always were, right?

1046
00:49:52,137 --> 00:49:54,655
- Yeah.
- Oh.

1047
00:49:55,482 --> 00:49:57,758
Okay.

1048
00:50:00,103 --> 00:50:03,551
So you were always meant
to live in this house.

1049
00:50:04,689 --> 00:50:09,000
Yeah, Christmas wasn't the
really big thing in my house,

1050
00:50:09,103 --> 00:50:12,827
so there's not
a lot of this stuff.

1051
00:50:12,931 --> 00:50:15,275
You mind if I borrow
this for a little bit?

1052
00:50:15,379 --> 00:50:17,896
It'll come in handy
for the restoration.

1053
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,931
Yeah, um...

1054
00:50:21,034 --> 00:50:22,965
You don't like to talk
about yourself, do you?

1055
00:50:23,068 --> 00:50:27,758
Nah, no one
needs to know about me.

1056
00:50:28,965 --> 00:50:30,965
Well, people might
like what they see.

1057
00:50:31,068 --> 00:50:32,965
Okay, I know what
you're trying to do.

1058
00:50:33,068 --> 00:50:35,275
- You do, do you?
- Uh-huh.

1059
00:50:35,379 --> 00:50:40,931
You're trying to get
me to open up, right?

1060
00:50:41,034 --> 00:50:43,068
You think you're so clever.

1061
00:50:43,172 --> 00:50:45,724
I've been working with
you for six years, too.

1062
00:50:45,827 --> 00:50:46,620
I know you pretty well.

1063
00:50:46,724 --> 00:50:48,000
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1064
00:50:51,034 --> 00:50:52,689
So you think you know me?

1065
00:50:52,793 --> 00:50:56,379
Yeah, expert level.
Ask me anything.

1066
00:50:56,482 --> 00:50:57,896
Piece of cake, which is, uh...

1067
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,758
Strawberry chocolate
is your favorite.

1068
00:50:59,862 --> 00:51:01,758
- Wow.
- Yeah.

1069
00:51:01,862 --> 00:51:03,793
Okay, what do I get
if you're wrong?

1070
00:51:03,896 --> 00:51:06,517
Uh, episode without
a sledgehammer.

1071
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:07,965
Okay, I'm in. Let's do this.

1072
00:51:08,068 --> 00:51:10,275
All right, three questions, go.

1073
00:51:10,379 --> 00:51:11,838
Okay, what do I always
have in my fridge?

1074
00:51:11,862 --> 00:51:14,034
Um... easy. Champagne.

1075
00:51:14,137 --> 00:51:17,103
Life is a celebration.
Always be prepared.

1076
00:51:17,206 --> 00:51:21,482
Okay.
What is my favorite color?

1077
00:51:21,586 --> 00:51:22,586
Blue-green... ah...

1078
00:51:22,689 --> 00:51:24,034
Green-blue, green-blue.

1079
00:51:24,137 --> 00:51:25,838
Yeah, 'cause apparently
there's a huge difference.

1080
00:51:25,862 --> 00:51:28,827
'Cause there is.
That was great, wow.

1081
00:51:28,931 --> 00:51:32,793
Um, okay, and... what is
my favorite thing to do

1082
00:51:32,896 --> 00:51:35,206
- on my day off?
- Uh...

1083
00:51:35,310 --> 00:51:38,827
that's a trick question
'cause you never take days off.

1084
00:51:38,931 --> 00:51:40,137
- You're good.
- See?

1085
00:51:40,241 --> 00:51:43,000
Nothing gets past me.
I'm a contractor!

1086
00:51:43,103 --> 00:51:48,000
I notice every detail.

1087
00:51:56,310 --> 00:51:59,827
- Oh, shoot!
- Shoot! Right here.

1088
00:51:59,931 --> 00:52:01,551
I just made it worse.
Sorry.

1089
00:52:01,655 --> 00:52:03,320
- You have some on your hand.
- It's a mess.

1090
00:52:03,344 --> 00:52:05,551
There.
Sorry.

1091
00:52:22,275 --> 00:52:23,758
- Um, uh...
- Sorry.

1092
00:52:23,862 --> 00:52:26,034
- Yup.
- I didn't plan for that too.

1093
00:52:26,137 --> 00:52:27,931
I should go.

1094
00:52:36,137 --> 00:52:39,000
So I was gonna load in
all the appliances

1095
00:52:39,103 --> 00:52:43,000
for the end of this week,
but now that's all on hold.

1096
00:52:43,103 --> 00:52:44,482
Hm.

1097
00:52:47,793 --> 00:52:50,862
So, what is going on?

1098
00:52:50,965 --> 00:52:52,551
Maggie called me
the other night.

1099
00:52:52,655 --> 00:52:56,275
She's producing a new show.
Wants me to host it.

1100
00:52:56,379 --> 00:52:57,620
Nice, congrats.

1101
00:52:57,724 --> 00:53:00,172
Something I always wanted to do.

1102
00:53:00,275 --> 00:53:02,241
What did Stella say?

1103
00:53:02,344 --> 00:53:04,586
No Stella, just me.

1104
00:53:04,689 --> 00:53:06,172
I've been gone for 10 days,

1105
00:53:06,275 --> 00:53:10,413
and something's going on.
You're completely different.

1106
00:53:10,517 --> 00:53:12,620
Nothing, I'm... I'm fine.

1107
00:53:12,724 --> 00:53:15,068
Ah, offers like that
don't come around often.

1108
00:53:15,172 --> 00:53:17,620
Yeah, they don't.
There's also this other thing.

1109
00:53:17,724 --> 00:53:21,655
Um, it's just a lot of
stuff with Jack, actually.

1110
00:53:21,758 --> 00:53:24,068
Oh, come on, that's
just pre-wedding jitters.

1111
00:53:24,172 --> 00:53:25,965
It's nothing.
Everyone goes through that.

1112
00:53:26,068 --> 00:53:27,827
I wish. Uh...

1113
00:53:27,931 --> 00:53:30,586
Then there's...
There's the Pablo of it all.

1114
00:53:30,689 --> 00:53:32,448
"The Pablo of it all"?

1115
00:53:32,551 --> 00:53:34,689
The other night,

1116
00:53:34,793 --> 00:53:37,310
Stella and I were here late.

1117
00:53:37,413 --> 00:53:40,931
Me and Stella, uh... relaxed.

1118
00:53:41,034 --> 00:53:44,448
And them, um...

1119
00:53:44,551 --> 00:53:45,896
I kissed her.

1120
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,241
We kissed.

1121
00:53:48,344 --> 00:53:50,517
- You kissed?
- Shut up.

1122
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:53,310
Dude, I saw this from years ago.
Did she kiss you back?

1123
00:53:53,413 --> 00:53:54,413
Yeah.

1124
00:53:54,482 --> 00:53:56,241
- Shhh!
- It's just a kiss.

1125
00:53:56,344 --> 00:53:58,389
- Was it a serious kiss?
- I don't know, I don't know.

1126
00:53:58,413 --> 00:54:00,413
I can't even... I don't know.

1127
00:54:00,517 --> 00:54:02,620
I mean, how are we
even gonna work together

1128
00:54:02,724 --> 00:54:05,517
after she marries Jack?

1129
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:08,758
Should I just take
the other job or...

1130
00:54:08,862 --> 00:54:11,379
Okay, so now what?

1131
00:54:14,482 --> 00:54:16,655
♪ La, la, la

1132
00:54:16,758 --> 00:54:18,344
♪ La, la, la, la, la, la

1133
00:54:18,448 --> 00:54:20,562
Everyone, welcome to our
cast and crew Christmas party,

1134
00:54:20,586 --> 00:54:23,620
the one time of year we give
our design team the day off

1135
00:54:23,724 --> 00:54:26,000
and the crew decorates.

1136
00:54:27,689 --> 00:54:29,103
I know this has
been a tough shoot,

1137
00:54:29,206 --> 00:54:31,413
but we always seem to
pull through at the 11th hour,

1138
00:54:31,517 --> 00:54:34,310
so let's have some fun.
Merry Christmas.

1139
00:54:34,413 --> 00:54:38,000
And who better to kick
things off than Santa himself?

1140
00:54:38,103 --> 00:54:41,103
Ho, ho, ho!
Merry Christmas!

1141
00:54:41,206 --> 00:54:44,413
There's one for you.
And one for you.

1142
00:54:44,517 --> 00:54:46,689
Santa Claus?
More like Father Time.

1143
00:54:46,793 --> 00:54:48,206
You've been bad!

1144
00:54:48,310 --> 00:54:50,862
A lump of coal for you
for your smart mouth, uh-huh.

1145
00:54:50,965 --> 00:54:53,620
Here you go, so you
don't sulk like a baby.

1146
00:55:07,034 --> 00:55:08,734
We hired the best
structural engineering firm

1147
00:55:08,758 --> 00:55:10,724
in the city.
The fact that it was two men

1148
00:55:10,827 --> 00:55:12,241
brought me right
back to college,

1149
00:55:12,344 --> 00:55:15,068
where there were only
three women in my program,

1150
00:55:15,172 --> 00:55:16,448
including me!

1151
00:55:16,551 --> 00:55:18,631
People always ask me what
a structural engineer does.

1152
00:55:18,724 --> 00:55:21,275
- I never know what to say.
- Well, it's simple, really.

1153
00:55:21,379 --> 00:55:23,448
The architect designs
the layout of the building,

1154
00:55:23,551 --> 00:55:25,862
and the structural engineer
designs the skeleton

1155
00:55:25,965 --> 00:55:27,482
that fits within that layout.

1156
00:55:27,586 --> 00:55:30,862
Okay, so that the
building doesn't collapse.

1157
00:55:30,965 --> 00:55:32,862
Basically.

1158
00:55:44,517 --> 00:55:48,241
- What's the verdict?
- Well, we can confirm that

1159
00:55:48,344 --> 00:55:50,103
there's a major crack
in the foundation

1160
00:55:50,206 --> 00:55:52,620
beneath the loadbearing
living room exterior wall,

1161
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:55,137
which is why you
noticed the subsidence.

1162
00:55:55,241 --> 00:55:58,103
- The slope in the floor.
- Yeah, we get it, thanks.

1163
00:55:58,206 --> 00:55:59,896
So what are the next steps?

1164
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,560
Well, we need to look
at the soil study,

1165
00:56:01,586 --> 00:56:03,068
run the calculations.

1166
00:56:03,172 --> 00:56:05,620
But we do have a couple of
options we can offer you now.

1167
00:56:05,724 --> 00:56:08,000
- Who's the project manager?
- That's me.

1168
00:56:09,965 --> 00:56:12,448
I'm sorry, I thought you
were the interior designer.

1169
00:56:12,551 --> 00:56:16,310
I-I am.

1170
00:56:16,413 --> 00:56:18,655
Well, don't worry.
When our work is done,

1171
00:56:18,758 --> 00:56:21,413
you can make it look
all pretty again.

1172
00:56:21,517 --> 00:56:24,034
Excuse me?

1173
00:56:24,137 --> 00:56:26,551
Okay, so what are we looking at?

1174
00:56:26,655 --> 00:56:28,620
Well, the house needs to
be hydraulically lifted

1175
00:56:28,724 --> 00:56:30,620
so that we can remove
the damaged foundation.

1176
00:56:30,724 --> 00:56:31,965
I think you're overcorrecting.

1177
00:56:32,068 --> 00:56:35,551
Well, we build a platform
to secure the building

1178
00:56:35,655 --> 00:56:38,206
- while it's suspended.
- Suspended?

1179
00:56:38,310 --> 00:56:40,830
Lifting the house increases the
potential to torque the framing,

1180
00:56:40,896 --> 00:56:43,655
let alone damage the vintage
plaster in the woodwork.

1181
00:56:43,758 --> 00:56:46,000
I mean, how long
would this take?

1182
00:56:46,103 --> 00:56:47,827
Six to nine months.

1183
00:56:47,931 --> 00:56:51,448
- Come on, we're on a deadline.
- And what about our budget?

1184
00:56:51,551 --> 00:56:53,758
Ballpark, you're
looking at 4 to 500,000.

1185
00:56:53,862 --> 00:56:55,689
Half a million dollars?
Seriously?

1186
00:56:55,793 --> 00:56:58,137
Well, you
do have one other option.

1187
00:56:58,241 --> 00:57:02,379
You could consider not
dealing with the issue at all.

1188
00:57:02,482 --> 00:57:06,517
- I'm not following.
- Tear the house down.

1189
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:09,172
Property's probably worth
more than the structure.

1190
00:57:09,275 --> 00:57:11,172
This isn't a structure.
It's my home.

1191
00:57:11,275 --> 00:57:13,000
We're done here. Thank you.

1192
00:57:13,103 --> 00:57:13,931
Cut, please.

1193
00:57:14,034 --> 00:57:16,310
Oh no. What's happening?

1194
00:57:18,482 --> 00:57:20,724
That engineering team
was so condescending, Mom.

1195
00:57:20,827 --> 00:57:23,517
Like I should stick to
picking out throw pillows.

1196
00:57:25,517 --> 00:57:27,689
What do you think?

1197
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:31,862
Ah!

1198
00:57:32,931 --> 00:57:36,586
That is fantastic, Mom.
Where did you get these?

1199
00:57:36,689 --> 00:57:38,448
Andy had a friend
who's a model maker.

1200
00:57:38,551 --> 00:57:41,103
And I'm gonna make one for
every table at the reception.

1201
00:57:41,206 --> 00:57:42,606
You do not have to
do all that, Mom.

1202
00:57:42,689 --> 00:57:45,862
Of course I do.
I have a week.

1203
00:57:45,965 --> 00:57:49,724
Though I wouldn't say no
to an extra set of hands.

1204
00:57:49,827 --> 00:57:52,448
Yeah, I could use
a little break.

1205
00:57:57,482 --> 00:58:00,655
I'm sorry you're having so much
trouble with the house, Stella.

1206
00:58:01,896 --> 00:58:04,655
You know, I love my
job more than anything.

1207
00:58:04,758 --> 00:58:07,758
I wouldn't wanna be
doing anything else.

1208
00:58:07,862 --> 00:58:12,206
But on days like today,
I just feel powerless,

1209
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:15,000
like maybe I should've
just stayed in school.

1210
00:58:15,103 --> 00:58:16,862
Don't be so hard on yourself.

1211
00:58:16,965 --> 00:58:19,586
No, but what if I made
the wrong decision?

1212
00:58:27,379 --> 00:58:31,448
- What the heck?
- My goodness.

1213
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:33,448
- That leather!
- Mm-hmm.

1214
00:58:36,551 --> 00:58:38,172
What is this?

1215
00:58:41,275 --> 00:58:44,620
This is lovely.

1216
00:58:44,724 --> 00:58:46,793
It was your
great-great-grandmother's.

1217
00:58:46,896 --> 00:58:48,172
Really?

1218
00:58:48,275 --> 00:58:49,896
I didn't know she was an artist.

1219
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,448
Neither did I.

1220
00:58:51,551 --> 00:58:55,172
You know, this was in an old
steamer trunk in the basement.

1221
00:58:55,275 --> 00:58:57,586
Look at the house.

1222
00:58:58,896 --> 00:59:01,344
Can I make a suggestion?

1223
00:59:01,448 --> 00:59:06,620
Why don't you go play a little?
Have some fun.

1224
00:59:06,724 --> 00:59:09,620
I don't know, that feels weird.
This was hers, you know?

1225
00:59:09,724 --> 00:59:11,113
Well, I think your
great-great-grandmother

1226
00:59:11,137 --> 00:59:13,482
would be honored to
share the page with you.

1227
00:59:13,586 --> 00:59:15,493
Maybe it'll help you come
up with a better solution

1228
00:59:15,517 --> 00:59:19,103
than those engineers.

1229
00:59:21,482 --> 00:59:24,137
Maybe.

1230
00:59:25,793 --> 00:59:26,931
I'm not a late night person.

1231
00:59:27,034 --> 00:59:29,310
She called me at 3:00 AM
talking a mile a minute.

1232
00:59:29,413 --> 00:59:31,586
Well, I figured it out!
The foundation solution.

1233
00:59:31,689 --> 00:59:34,586
Okay, so our main goal
is to save time and money.

1234
00:59:34,689 --> 00:59:39,137
So, we're going to put an
exterior sister wall here

1235
00:59:39,241 --> 00:59:41,655
to shift the load of
the damaged sections.

1236
00:59:41,758 --> 00:59:43,965
And we'll use soil anchors
and vertical screws

1237
00:59:44,068 --> 00:59:46,103
to help support
the new foundation.

1238
00:59:46,206 --> 00:59:48,724
And this is all so that we
don't have to jack up the house,

1239
00:59:48,827 --> 00:59:50,896
which saves us the
plaster, the woodwork,

1240
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,310
- and an insane amount of money.
- This is genius, Stella.

1241
00:59:54,413 --> 00:59:56,896
But isn't the sister foundation
going to be an eyesore?

1242
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,379
I mean, it will be.

1243
00:59:58,482 --> 01:00:01,206
Stella's already
thought of that.

1244
01:00:01,310 --> 01:00:03,413
Well, we can copy
the existing porch design

1245
01:00:03,517 --> 01:00:05,620
on the side of the house
and put a new one here,

1246
01:00:05,724 --> 01:00:07,827
which will cover
the foundation work,

1247
01:00:07,931 --> 01:00:10,068
and it'll look like it
was there all along.

1248
01:00:10,172 --> 01:00:12,012
And based on all this,
we should be able to get

1249
01:00:12,068 --> 01:00:14,827
a temporary occupancy
certificate from the city

1250
01:00:14,931 --> 01:00:16,655
right away.

1251
01:00:16,758 --> 01:00:18,827
And we got it! Cut!

1252
01:00:26,068 --> 01:00:29,172
- That was amazing!
- Thanks!

1253
01:00:31,482 --> 01:00:34,931
Between us, do you really think
we're gonna finish this in time?

1254
01:00:35,034 --> 01:00:37,482
We're less than a week
away from the wedding.

1255
01:00:37,586 --> 01:00:39,172
Yeah, we can now.

1256
01:00:39,275 --> 01:00:41,724
But we're gonna have to
let the dining room go.

1257
01:00:41,827 --> 01:00:44,103
Yeah, I was, um...
I was afraid of that.

1258
01:00:44,206 --> 01:00:46,620
Yeah, there's just no way
with all the foundation work

1259
01:00:46,724 --> 01:00:48,344
and, um...

1260
01:00:50,034 --> 01:00:53,517
I have to apologize
about the other night.

1261
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:54,793
Went too far.

1262
01:00:54,896 --> 01:00:57,482
You got me thinking about a lot.

1263
01:00:57,586 --> 01:00:59,241
What are you thinking?

1264
01:00:59,344 --> 01:01:02,379
Everything's back on track.

1265
01:01:02,482 --> 01:01:04,896
Everything?

1266
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,482
Yeah.

1267
01:01:06,586 --> 01:01:09,896
Okay, well, um...

1268
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,206
I wish you and Jack the best,
and if you never need anything,

1269
01:01:13,310 --> 01:01:15,344
I'm here for you, always.

1270
01:01:15,448 --> 01:01:16,655
Hello! Sorry to interrupt.

1271
01:01:16,758 --> 01:01:18,158
I just have a minor
schedule change.

1272
01:01:18,241 --> 01:01:19,896
No, no more changes.

1273
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,758
There's been enough
drama for one episode.

1274
01:01:21,862 --> 01:01:24,275
Uh-huh, well, since we had
to shut down for five days...

1275
01:01:24,379 --> 01:01:25,655
Okay, wait, they're not...

1276
01:01:25,758 --> 01:01:27,182
They're not canceling
the episode, are they?

1277
01:01:27,206 --> 01:01:28,758
No, no, no.
Something even better.

1278
01:01:28,862 --> 01:01:32,103
Uh, the network has decided
that we are going to do it live.

1279
01:01:32,206 --> 01:01:33,206
Live on television.

1280
01:01:33,241 --> 01:01:34,241
- What?
- What?

1281
01:01:34,344 --> 01:01:36,034
We've never done
a live broadcast.

1282
01:01:36,137 --> 01:01:38,758
And what better a time to do it
than, you know, Christmas Eve?

1283
01:01:38,862 --> 01:01:40,344
The wedding, reveal.

1284
01:01:40,448 --> 01:01:42,379
Everyone gets to see you
say "I do" in real time.

1285
01:01:42,482 --> 01:01:43,827
It's gonna be great.

1286
01:01:43,931 --> 01:01:45,424
Do you realize how much pressure
this puts everyone under?

1287
01:01:45,448 --> 01:01:46,793
I'm aware.
We don't have a choice.

1288
01:01:58,724 --> 01:02:01,034
- Hey, Pablo!
- Hey, Greg!

1289
01:02:01,862 --> 01:02:03,206
Careful of the wall.

1290
01:02:03,310 --> 01:02:04,758
Yup, that's where
it always went.

1291
01:02:04,862 --> 01:02:07,758
A little help, please?
Thank you.

1292
01:02:10,068 --> 01:02:14,137
Oh, jeez.
Okay under there?

1293
01:02:14,931 --> 01:02:16,827
All right, uh...
Okay.

1294
01:02:16,931 --> 01:02:19,310
Can you turn it
a little to the left?

1295
01:02:19,413 --> 01:02:21,000
- Yeah.
- It's leaning.

1296
01:02:21,103 --> 01:02:23,896
Uh... okay, yep, almost.
Perfect.

1297
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,217
- There, there, there, there.
- Yeah?

1298
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:27,000
- Got it.
- Yep?

1299
01:02:28,551 --> 01:02:29,827
Stella, hi.

1300
01:02:29,931 --> 01:02:31,965
Your fiancé is running late
yet again,

1301
01:02:32,068 --> 01:02:33,137
so surprise, surprise.

1302
01:02:33,241 --> 01:02:35,689
If he's handing out
paint cans, I...

1303
01:02:35,793 --> 01:02:38,172
Anyway, I told him
4:00 sharp, no excuses.

1304
01:02:38,275 --> 01:02:40,068
We need to rehearse
the wedding blocking.

1305
01:02:40,172 --> 01:02:41,931
We can't just, like,
wing it tomorrow night.

1306
01:02:42,034 --> 01:02:43,586
He's probably
stuck in a meeting.

1307
01:02:43,689 --> 01:02:44,689
I'll text him.

1308
01:02:44,758 --> 01:02:45,838
You know what?
Don't bother.

1309
01:02:45,862 --> 01:02:47,010
We'll just rehearse without him.

1310
01:02:47,034 --> 01:02:48,965
Pablo, you can stand in, right?

1311
01:02:49,068 --> 01:02:50,068
- Stand what?
- Yeah,

1312
01:02:50,103 --> 01:02:51,000
you just have to say, like,

1313
01:02:51,103 --> 01:02:52,251
can I have your hand in
marriage,

1314
01:02:52,275 --> 01:02:53,689
blah, blah, blah.
Merry Christmas.

1315
01:02:53,793 --> 01:02:54,655
Yadda, yadda, yadda.

1316
01:02:54,758 --> 01:02:58,137
Uh... uh.

1317
01:02:58,241 --> 01:03:00,724
I'm not sure that I...

1318
01:03:00,827 --> 01:03:02,620
Great. Let's go.

1319
01:03:03,586 --> 01:03:05,148
Okay, so then we're gonna
have the happy couple

1320
01:03:05,172 --> 01:03:07,103
walking down the
aisle, everybody.

1321
01:03:07,206 --> 01:03:08,665
They're gonna come
right down through there.

1322
01:03:08,689 --> 01:03:10,344
Oh, yeah, there is no aisle.
No veil.

1323
01:03:10,448 --> 01:03:13,275
Just close friends and
family, and lots of wine.

1324
01:03:13,379 --> 01:03:15,517
Okay, well, let's, uh,
pretend that there's an aisle.

1325
01:03:15,620 --> 01:03:17,551
♪ Nah, nah, nah-nah,
marriage, marriage, ys ♪

1326
01:03:17,655 --> 01:03:20,344
Okay, perfect. And A camera,
I'm gonna have you follow them.

1327
01:03:20,448 --> 01:03:21,758
And then B, I want you to get in

1328
01:03:21,862 --> 01:03:23,689
some close-ups
and some cutaways.

1329
01:03:23,793 --> 01:03:24,862
Okay, great.

1330
01:03:24,965 --> 01:03:26,525
Stella, where did
you wanna do the vows?

1331
01:03:26,620 --> 01:03:28,793
Um, right... right here,
in front of the fireplace.

1332
01:03:28,896 --> 01:03:30,862
Oh, perfect! Okay.

1333
01:03:30,965 --> 01:03:32,000
Um, okay, Gabe,

1334
01:03:32,103 --> 01:03:34,793
you're gonna be,
you know, the person,

1335
01:03:34,896 --> 01:03:37,689
the official official.
Great, okay.

1336
01:03:37,793 --> 01:03:39,172
Bride and groom.

1337
01:03:39,275 --> 01:03:41,172
Can we get you guys
in a little bit closer?

1338
01:03:41,275 --> 01:03:42,493
We're just trying
to avoid glare.

1339
01:03:42,517 --> 01:03:45,000
A little bit more, please.
Yeah, great.

1340
01:03:45,103 --> 01:03:47,482
Okay, in, in, in, in, in.

1341
01:03:47,586 --> 01:03:49,482
Closer, okay?

1342
01:03:49,586 --> 01:03:51,551
Nice, nice, perfect.

1343
01:03:51,655 --> 01:03:53,862
And looking into
each other's eyes.

1344
01:03:53,965 --> 01:03:55,000
Great.

1345
01:03:55,103 --> 01:03:56,862
And, uh, I guess
we can hear the vows.

1346
01:03:56,965 --> 01:03:58,000
- Vows?
- Yeah,

1347
01:03:58,103 --> 01:03:59,586
we need you to run your vows.

1348
01:03:59,689 --> 01:04:01,689
I haven't written mine yet.

1349
01:04:01,793 --> 01:04:04,010
Oh, it's more of a timing thing.
We're going live, Stella,

1350
01:04:04,034 --> 01:04:07,034
so there's no room for error, so
just, like, improvise something.

1351
01:04:07,137 --> 01:04:10,275
Just looking into each
other's eyes for camera.

1352
01:04:12,862 --> 01:04:17,793
I, Stella Murphy,
take you, Jack Hall,

1353
01:04:17,896 --> 01:04:20,896
to be my partner.

1354
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,482
And I, Pablo Belmonte...

1355
01:04:23,586 --> 01:04:26,448
- Oh, you're Jack right now.
- Right. Sorry.

1356
01:04:26,551 --> 01:04:29,103
Uh... I, Jake...

1357
01:04:29,206 --> 01:04:30,734
Okay, can we at least
exchange the rings

1358
01:04:30,758 --> 01:04:32,275
so we can just see
that rehearsal?

1359
01:04:32,379 --> 01:04:33,827
Are there rings?

1360
01:04:33,931 --> 01:04:35,965
Let's just mime it right now.

1361
01:04:37,172 --> 01:04:39,448
Perfect.

1362
01:04:41,068 --> 01:04:44,275
Okay. All right.

1363
01:04:44,379 --> 01:04:46,206
And I guess here is
where we do, like,

1364
01:04:46,310 --> 01:04:48,517
you may kiss the bride,
yadda, yadda, yadda.

1365
01:04:56,620 --> 01:04:59,310
Well! Looks like I got here
in the nick of time.

1366
01:04:59,413 --> 01:05:00,827
- Hi!
- Hey.

1367
01:05:00,931 --> 01:05:03,241
Let's do it again.
The right way.

1368
01:05:11,758 --> 01:05:14,206
Uh, no, let's flip these,

1369
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:16,724
and then we can feature that
off the top and then see what...

1370
01:05:16,827 --> 01:05:17,827
- Pablo!
- Sorry.

1371
01:05:17,931 --> 01:05:19,689
All right, thanks, Andy.

1372
01:05:19,793 --> 01:05:21,034
Hey.

1373
01:05:21,137 --> 01:05:22,596
Thanks for standing
in for me today, buddy.

1374
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:24,482
Yeah, anytime, all good.

1375
01:05:24,586 --> 01:05:29,172
So, you've been spending an
awful lot of time with Stella.

1376
01:05:29,275 --> 01:05:30,482
I don't know...

1377
01:05:30,586 --> 01:05:34,034
No more than
I have in the past six years.

1378
01:05:34,137 --> 01:05:35,620
Heh. Yeah...

1379
01:05:35,724 --> 01:05:38,000
So, have you...
Have you told Stella

1380
01:05:38,103 --> 01:05:40,655
that you don't wanna live here?

1381
01:05:42,862 --> 01:05:44,482
We'll work it out.

1382
01:05:44,586 --> 01:05:47,034
Besides, she's got
a lot on her plate, anyway.

1383
01:05:47,137 --> 01:05:50,241
Yeah, but I think...
I think you should tell her

1384
01:05:50,344 --> 01:05:52,965
- sooner rather than later?
- I appreciate your concern.

1385
01:05:53,068 --> 01:05:54,689
But I have an IPO to focus on.

1386
01:05:54,793 --> 01:05:57,000
If your little show
doesn't get picked up,

1387
01:05:57,103 --> 01:05:58,655
I gotta be able to
take care of Stella.

1388
01:05:58,758 --> 01:06:02,068
Jack, Stella can
take care of herself.

1389
01:06:02,172 --> 01:06:04,310
You don't need to
worry about her.

1390
01:06:04,413 --> 01:06:06,482
This place is really
important to her.

1391
01:06:06,586 --> 01:06:08,344
If you didn't notice.

1392
01:06:17,172 --> 01:06:20,310
Okay, you moved
some furniture around.

1393
01:06:20,413 --> 01:06:23,206
- Just like home.
- I needed to make it my own.

1394
01:06:23,310 --> 01:06:24,793
Huh.

1395
01:06:24,896 --> 01:06:28,896
Hey, I think I'm gonna
go back to school.

1396
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,241
Stella, that's great.

1397
01:06:36,862 --> 01:06:39,620
Um... oh.

1398
01:06:39,724 --> 01:06:42,000
You need some lights at the top.

1399
01:06:42,103 --> 01:06:44,758
I'm sorry, did I just
here Pablo Belmonte

1400
01:06:44,862 --> 01:06:47,551
tell me that I need
more Christmas lights?

1401
01:06:47,655 --> 01:06:48,689
I already have too many.

1402
01:06:48,793 --> 01:06:51,896
Okay, no arguments. Fine.

1403
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,379
Do you think we're ever
gonna agree on anything?

1404
01:06:54,482 --> 01:06:56,758
Oh, come on, I think we agree

1405
01:06:56,862 --> 01:06:58,724
more than either
of us will admit,

1406
01:06:58,827 --> 01:07:02,689
but, hey, I'm proud of you.
School's important.

1407
01:07:02,793 --> 01:07:04,655
The show will take
care of itself.

1408
01:07:04,758 --> 01:07:08,620
Don't worry. In fact, um...

1409
01:07:08,724 --> 01:07:14,344
I was offered a show,
if we don't get picked up.

1410
01:07:14,448 --> 01:07:17,931
- An-another... another show?
- Yup.

1411
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:20,655
How long, um...
How long have you known?

1412
01:07:20,758 --> 01:07:22,689
Why didn't you tell me?

1413
01:07:22,793 --> 01:07:27,000
Um, I hadn't figured
out what I wanna do yet.

1414
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:30,241
So you're gonna leave
our show for a new show?

1415
01:07:30,344 --> 01:07:34,310
Well, there might not
be any more... show...

1416
01:07:34,413 --> 01:07:37,758
Stella, it's time that we start
thinking about our futures,

1417
01:07:37,862 --> 01:07:41,000
together or separate,
whatever it may be.

1418
01:07:41,103 --> 01:07:45,620
- What are you saying?
- What I'm saying is...

1419
01:07:45,724 --> 01:07:49,103
Okay.
If we get picked up...

1420
01:07:51,724 --> 01:07:55,344
I'm not sure that I can
keep things between me and you

1421
01:07:55,448 --> 01:07:58,275
- the same after you marry Jack.
- What are you talking about?

1422
01:07:58,379 --> 01:07:59,965
We'll be fine.
We can get past this.

1423
01:08:00,068 --> 01:08:04,827
I'm... I... I'm trying
to be honest about...

1424
01:08:04,931 --> 01:08:07,034
About how I feel.

1425
01:08:07,137 --> 01:08:08,758
And... and we can't
keep playacting

1426
01:08:08,862 --> 01:08:10,206
like we were this afternoon.

1427
01:08:10,310 --> 01:08:11,790
I'm sorry, is that
what we were doing?

1428
01:08:11,862 --> 01:08:14,103
- Playacting?
- Are you trying to say that

1429
01:08:14,206 --> 01:08:16,206
you don't feel the
same way about me?

1430
01:08:16,310 --> 01:08:17,862
Okay, can we not
do this right now?

1431
01:08:17,965 --> 01:08:20,517
No, 'cause you're
less than 24 hours away

1432
01:08:20,620 --> 01:08:22,448
from getting married.

1433
01:08:25,310 --> 01:08:26,665
Okay, you're just
too afraid to say it.

1434
01:08:26,689 --> 01:08:29,551
- No, that's not it.
- Then what is it?

1435
01:08:32,827 --> 01:08:34,586
You can tell me to leave.

1436
01:08:34,689 --> 01:08:36,724
Say it to my face
and we're done.

1437
01:08:36,827 --> 01:08:40,344
We can both go
our separate ways.

1438
01:08:43,827 --> 01:08:45,827
I think you were right.

1439
01:08:45,931 --> 01:08:48,344
I think you should
take the other show.

1440
01:08:48,448 --> 01:08:51,517
And I think it's time we both
just move on with our lives.

1441
01:08:54,931 --> 01:08:56,793
Is that how you really feel?

1442
01:09:08,034 --> 01:09:09,655
Okay.

1443
01:09:18,896 --> 01:09:24,344
♪ I light a candle, put the
presents 'round the tree ♪

1444
01:09:26,241 --> 01:09:32,172
♪ The sound of carols
fills the air ♪

1445
01:09:33,344 --> 01:09:36,793
♪ Outside, the snow is falling

1446
01:09:36,896 --> 01:09:42,241
♪ I hear the children calling

1447
01:09:42,344 --> 01:09:47,724
Wow, I can't believe this.
Look at what you did in here!

1448
01:09:47,827 --> 01:09:50,000
Aren't you meant
to be getting ready?

1449
01:09:50,103 --> 01:09:52,182
Yeah, I just wanted to do
one more quick walkthrough.

1450
01:09:52,206 --> 01:09:54,689
I mean, the kitchen
is just so amazing.

1451
01:09:54,793 --> 01:09:56,193
You really outdid
yourself, Freddie.

1452
01:09:56,241 --> 01:09:57,655
Thank you!

1453
01:09:57,758 --> 01:10:01,275
Yeah, I'm pretty happy
with it, all things considered.

1454
01:10:02,379 --> 01:10:04,000
So, here's the thing.

1455
01:10:04,103 --> 01:10:08,620
The caterers dropped off what I
think is meant to be your cake.

1456
01:10:08,724 --> 01:10:10,689
But I'm not sure if
they're colorblind

1457
01:10:10,793 --> 01:10:12,896
or you actually
chose this color?

1458
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,655
It's Salmon in Aspic.

1459
01:10:14,758 --> 01:10:17,655
It's Jack's favorite
paint color.

1460
01:10:17,758 --> 01:10:21,206
And they took the bar
of soap direction too...

1461
01:10:21,310 --> 01:10:22,758
way too literally.

1462
01:10:22,862 --> 01:10:26,551
You gave them
"bar of soap" directions?

1463
01:10:27,862 --> 01:10:31,689
- Oh! Stella!
- What am I doing?

1464
01:10:31,793 --> 01:10:36,275
- It's gonna be okay!
- No, it's not.

1465
01:10:36,379 --> 01:10:40,689
None of it is.
But I've run out of time.

1466
01:10:40,793 --> 01:10:44,793
So I just have to
keep moving forward.

1467
01:10:44,896 --> 01:10:47,068
Okay, I'm sorry, but that
is the most ridiculous thing

1468
01:10:47,172 --> 01:10:48,931
that I have ever heard from you.

1469
01:10:49,034 --> 01:10:51,586
One of the reasons that
you're such a talented

1470
01:10:51,689 --> 01:10:55,241
and exceptional designer is
because you trust your instincts

1471
01:10:55,344 --> 01:10:57,241
and you listen to your heart.

1472
01:10:57,344 --> 01:11:01,482
And it's time that you
applied that to your life.

1473
01:11:01,586 --> 01:11:04,896
Come on, listen to your heart.

1474
01:11:27,586 --> 01:11:30,034
Okay, what's going on?

1475
01:11:30,137 --> 01:11:32,517
Mom, I don't know
what I'm doing.

1476
01:11:36,241 --> 01:11:40,103
I got in a fight
with Pablo last night.

1477
01:11:40,206 --> 01:11:42,724
And it was bad.

1478
01:11:42,827 --> 01:11:45,344
But the worst part
about it is I can't...

1479
01:11:45,448 --> 01:11:49,241
I can't stop thinking about him.

1480
01:11:50,586 --> 01:11:52,769
I'm supposed to be getting
married in less than an hour.

1481
01:11:52,793 --> 01:11:54,172
What am I doing?

1482
01:11:58,137 --> 01:11:59,734
You know, when I got
married to your father,

1483
01:11:59,758 --> 01:12:03,034
I had such butterflies
in my stomach.

1484
01:12:03,137 --> 01:12:05,206
My hands wouldn't stop shaking.

1485
01:12:05,310 --> 01:12:07,270
I didn't think I was gonna
make it down the aisle.

1486
01:12:10,137 --> 01:12:14,241
But inside, there
was this... calm.

1487
01:12:21,862 --> 01:12:23,655
I can't do this.

1488
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,758
Hey, isn't this bad
luck or something?

1489
01:12:32,862 --> 01:12:34,622
Can you, um... can you
please turn your mic off

1490
01:12:34,655 --> 01:12:37,103
and come here for a second?
I need to talk to you.

1491
01:12:37,206 --> 01:12:40,724
- What's wrong, Stella?
- No cameras, please. Please?

1492
01:12:40,827 --> 01:12:42,103
Come here.

1493
01:12:50,137 --> 01:12:51,413
Okay, so after we get the shot

1494
01:12:51,517 --> 01:12:54,758
of the scrim being pulled
away, you lead everybody...

1495
01:12:54,862 --> 01:12:56,379
- Happy?
- Yeah.

1496
01:12:57,862 --> 01:12:59,517
What's happening?

1497
01:13:01,931 --> 01:13:03,862
Um, okay, shoo!
Shoo!

1498
01:13:03,965 --> 01:13:06,344
Okay, we're good! Bye.

1499
01:13:10,103 --> 01:13:11,965
I think we have a runaway bride.
No.

1500
01:13:12,068 --> 01:13:13,172
What?

1501
01:13:19,448 --> 01:13:20,827
Excuse me.

1502
01:13:20,931 --> 01:13:22,211
How long have
they been in there?

1503
01:13:22,275 --> 01:13:24,482
What the hell is going on?
Are they fighting?

1504
01:13:24,586 --> 01:13:27,137
They're not fighting.
Are they practicing their vows?

1505
01:13:27,241 --> 01:13:29,517
Are they mic'ed right now?
Where's my headset?

1506
01:13:39,379 --> 01:13:41,103
Pablo, do you know
what's happening?

1507
01:13:44,793 --> 01:13:46,862
Jack, can you say
something, please?

1508
01:13:48,931 --> 01:13:51,827
What do you want me to say?

1509
01:13:54,827 --> 01:13:56,620
I think I knew this
was gonna happen

1510
01:13:56,724 --> 01:14:00,137
- the day you bought the house.
- You did?

1511
01:14:01,965 --> 01:14:04,517
Look, Stella, I am
always gonna love you.

1512
01:14:06,344 --> 01:14:09,655
Maybe we shouldn't, you
know, go through with this.

1513
01:14:13,379 --> 01:14:15,655
I think you're right.

1514
01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:40,103
Um... what do we do now?

1515
01:14:40,206 --> 01:14:41,724
About the wedding or the show?

1516
01:14:41,827 --> 01:14:44,724
Both. There's so many people.

1517
01:14:44,827 --> 01:14:46,862
I'll get rid of the people.

1518
01:14:46,965 --> 01:14:50,931
You go deal with
your show family, okay?

1519
01:14:55,275 --> 01:14:57,000
Thank you, Jack.

1520
01:15:01,241 --> 01:15:03,448
Oh! They're hugging.
Everything's fine.

1521
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:04,976
Everything's gonna be perfect.
Romance, okay.

1522
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,655
I'm going back to the tent.
Let's go!

1523
01:15:12,103 --> 01:15:14,931
Guys, guys, no cameras.
No cameras, guys!

1524
01:15:15,034 --> 01:15:16,862
No cameras.

1525
01:15:17,586 --> 01:15:18,482
- Wedding's off.
- Stella.

1526
01:15:18,586 --> 01:15:19,655
- We broke up.
- Stella.

1527
01:15:19,758 --> 01:15:20,976
- I couldn't do it.
- Are you okay?

1528
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,793
Well, the show is
gonna be a mess now.

1529
01:15:22,896 --> 01:15:24,286
I've ruined the show.
What are we gonna do?

1530
01:15:24,310 --> 01:15:25,562
- We'll figure it out.
- We don't have time.

1531
01:15:25,586 --> 01:15:27,103
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Don't tell me.

1532
01:15:27,206 --> 01:15:28,413
There's no wedding, Zoe.

1533
01:15:28,517 --> 01:15:30,477
Stella, I support all the
crazy stuff you wanna do

1534
01:15:30,551 --> 01:15:32,000
in your personal life,

1535
01:15:32,103 --> 01:15:33,976
but we are sixty minutes to air
and the network is expecting

1536
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:37,000
a big, fat Christmas wedding.

1537
01:15:37,103 --> 01:15:39,310
Can you two not
just get married?

1538
01:15:39,413 --> 01:15:40,862
What?

1539
01:15:40,965 --> 01:15:42,769
Everyone's been waiting for
this for, like, six years.

1540
01:15:42,793 --> 01:15:45,586
It's like, come on, already.
No?

1541
01:15:47,206 --> 01:15:48,551
Okay, it's a bad idea.

1542
01:15:48,655 --> 01:15:50,936
Okay, look, we still have
all this amazing before footage,

1543
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,137
the commentary cam,
the renovation.

1544
01:15:53,241 --> 01:15:56,758
And at the top, I'll just
explain about the wedding.

1545
01:15:56,862 --> 01:15:58,241
- How?
- Just, I'll be honest.

1546
01:15:58,344 --> 01:16:00,044
I mean, it's still the
same episode we planned...

1547
01:16:00,068 --> 01:16:02,068
The homecoming, Stella
reconnects with her family

1548
01:16:02,172 --> 01:16:04,000
and herself on Christmas Eve.

1549
01:16:04,103 --> 01:16:07,206
And, uh, Pablo has
the kind of holiday experience

1550
01:16:07,310 --> 01:16:10,034
- he's never had before.
- Ugh, it's not dynamic enough.

1551
01:16:10,137 --> 01:16:13,000
Uh, we need another element.
Okay, what do I have?

1552
01:16:13,103 --> 01:16:15,241
I have a runaway bride,
a house full of caterers,

1553
01:16:15,344 --> 01:16:18,655
and the ugliest wedding
cake I've ever seen.

1554
01:16:18,758 --> 01:16:21,517
You two are gonna put me
in my grave before I turn 30.

1555
01:16:21,620 --> 01:16:22,655
Aren't you 35?

1556
01:16:22,758 --> 01:16:24,310
No, I am not.
Who said that?

1557
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:26,517
Okay, well, this is not
about any of that stuff.

1558
01:16:26,620 --> 01:16:30,517
This episode is about
inviting our fans into my home

1559
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:34,344
to celebrate the rebirth
of this beautiful house.

1560
01:16:34,448 --> 01:16:36,206
Wait a second.

1561
01:16:36,310 --> 01:16:37,965
Why don't we just
do that literally?

1562
01:16:38,068 --> 01:16:39,206
- What?
- Literally?

1563
01:16:39,310 --> 01:16:40,862
We have millions of followers.

1564
01:16:40,965 --> 01:16:43,413
Why don't we just invite them
to come celebrate with us?

1565
01:16:43,517 --> 01:16:45,217
We'll just put out
a blast saying, come join us

1566
01:16:45,241 --> 01:16:48,344
for a very special
live Christmas Eve event?

1567
01:16:50,862 --> 01:16:53,310
Okay, I am loving it.
Let me make some calls.

1568
01:16:55,241 --> 01:16:56,862
Do you think that can work?

1569
01:16:56,965 --> 01:16:59,965
I mean, it might, I don't know.
I need to change.

1570
01:17:00,068 --> 01:17:01,493
I need to apologize
for the other night.

1571
01:17:01,517 --> 01:17:02,931
No, no, no, don't worry.

1572
01:17:03,034 --> 01:17:07,965
I'm thinking and seeing
everything more clearly now.

1573
01:17:08,068 --> 01:17:09,379
I think.

1574
01:17:09,482 --> 01:17:11,344
If we do get picked up,
we'll figure out a way

1575
01:17:11,448 --> 01:17:13,793
for the show to follow
you back to school.

1576
01:17:13,896 --> 01:17:16,103
Fans will love it.

1577
01:17:16,206 --> 01:17:21,758
But tonight, we're gonna do
the most amazing episode ever,

1578
01:17:21,862 --> 01:17:24,655
you and I, together.

1579
01:17:32,310 --> 01:17:33,965
Well, that was pretty gutsy.

1580
01:17:34,068 --> 01:17:37,586
But then, you're
no shrinking violet.

1581
01:17:37,689 --> 01:17:39,448
I mean, I-I had to
do something, Freddie.

1582
01:17:39,551 --> 01:17:41,103
Well, yes, and
I'm so proud of you.

1583
01:17:41,206 --> 01:17:42,310
You seized the day.

1584
01:17:42,413 --> 01:17:43,933
Well, I have the
best teacher there is.

1585
01:17:44,034 --> 01:17:45,413
Well, actually, yes, you do.

1586
01:17:45,517 --> 01:17:47,448
Aww!

1587
01:17:48,689 --> 01:17:51,068
That dress...

1588
01:17:51,172 --> 01:17:53,448
I really think you
should just keep it

1589
01:17:53,551 --> 01:17:55,379
- for another day.
- Okay.

1590
01:17:55,482 --> 01:17:57,241
Yeah, I like that.

1591
01:17:57,344 --> 01:17:59,355
Now, we actually really do have
something to celebrate here,

1592
01:17:59,379 --> 01:18:01,965
- like big.
- Okay. What?

1593
01:18:02,068 --> 01:18:04,793
None of us have to eat that
hideous orange wedding cake.

1594
01:18:04,896 --> 01:18:06,275
- What happened?
- I don't know.

1595
01:18:06,379 --> 01:18:08,310
It's ridiculous.
I can't even talk about it.

1596
01:18:08,413 --> 01:18:12,517
Erased, gone.
All right, listen.

1597
01:18:12,620 --> 01:18:14,310
Everyone's waiting
for you outside.

1598
01:18:14,413 --> 01:18:15,965
Are you ready?

1599
01:18:23,068 --> 01:18:25,689
Okay, crowd is
starting to arrive.

1600
01:18:41,413 --> 01:18:42,586
Okay, we are on

1601
01:18:42,689 --> 01:18:46,517
in five, four, three...

1602
01:18:48,793 --> 01:18:50,586
Welcome, and thank
you for joining us.

1603
01:18:50,689 --> 01:18:53,103
We are live for a very
special Christmas Eve episode

1604
01:18:53,206 --> 01:18:54,724
of House Sweet Home.

1605
01:18:54,827 --> 01:18:56,931
You might've expected me
to be in a wedding dress,

1606
01:18:57,034 --> 01:18:59,034
but like many things
on House Sweet Home,

1607
01:18:59,137 --> 01:19:02,241
life is full of surprises.
So for tonight,

1608
01:19:02,344 --> 01:19:04,172
that dress is going
back on the hanger,

1609
01:19:04,275 --> 01:19:06,482
while we celebrate the
rebirth of this beautiful

1610
01:19:06,586 --> 01:19:08,827
110-year-old treasure.

1611
01:19:08,931 --> 01:19:10,379
Okay, scrim on standby.

1612
01:19:10,482 --> 01:19:12,896
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready.

1613
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,241
Go on the scrim.
No, remove the scrim.

1614
01:19:16,310 --> 01:19:20,034
Welcome home!

1615
01:19:23,103 --> 01:19:25,241
All right, A and B
cam, follow them in.

1616
01:19:32,034 --> 01:19:33,734
Okay, A and B cam, get
into the final position.

1617
01:19:33,758 --> 01:19:34,862
Hurry, hurry.

1618
01:19:34,965 --> 01:19:36,413
We're live, people.
Quick, quick.

1619
01:19:36,517 --> 01:19:38,896
Ah, this is so beautiful!

1620
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,206
Roll the B-roll.

1621
01:19:40,310 --> 01:19:41,596
With the help of
Freddie, Pablo and I

1622
01:19:41,620 --> 01:19:43,379
and our amazing
construction crew

1623
01:19:43,482 --> 01:19:46,034
restored and
transformed the house.

1624
01:19:46,137 --> 01:19:47,586
Let's start with the kitchen.

1625
01:19:47,689 --> 01:19:50,896
This room went from a
badly lit DIY nightmare

1626
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,931
to a dream hosting space
with new appliances.

1627
01:19:54,034 --> 01:19:56,448
And we were even able to
restore my great-grandmother's

1628
01:19:56,551 --> 01:19:58,000
original cabinets.

1629
01:19:58,931 --> 01:20:00,517
Okay, next up.

1630
01:20:00,620 --> 01:20:02,379
It's gotta be the
Christmas tree.

1631
01:20:02,482 --> 01:20:04,379
Okay.

1632
01:20:04,482 --> 01:20:06,862
It really does
complete the space.

1633
01:20:06,965 --> 01:20:08,793
The ornaments look beautiful.

1634
01:20:08,896 --> 01:20:12,689
The living room went from
a drab construction zone

1635
01:20:12,793 --> 01:20:14,448
to the coziest of cozy rooms,

1636
01:20:14,551 --> 01:20:17,482
perfect for opening up
presents on Christmas morning.

1637
01:20:17,586 --> 01:20:19,113
Did the Grinch just
say "Christmas morning"

1638
01:20:19,137 --> 01:20:21,172
and "cozy cozy"
all in one sentence?

1639
01:20:21,275 --> 01:20:22,896
Yeah, he did.

1640
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,413
We replaced the marble facing

1641
01:20:24,517 --> 01:20:27,379
for a tile design
more in character.

1642
01:20:27,482 --> 01:20:29,862
And after discovering
original art glass windows

1643
01:20:29,965 --> 01:20:33,517
in the inglenook, it made
sense to complement it

1644
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:35,689
with vintage wallpaper

1645
01:20:35,793 --> 01:20:39,103
and bring the mantelpiece
back to its former glory.

1646
01:20:41,206 --> 01:20:42,931
The Santa keys?

1647
01:20:43,034 --> 01:20:44,758
Yeah, I polished
them up a little.

1648
01:20:44,862 --> 01:20:47,689
Now, the old Pablo definitely
would've taken all that

1649
01:20:47,793 --> 01:20:51,551
beautiful patina off, but
I figured after 100 years,

1650
01:20:51,655 --> 01:20:54,827
they deserved to be
a little tarnished.

1651
01:20:54,931 --> 01:20:56,379
Thank you.

1652
01:20:56,482 --> 01:20:58,103
Now, because of
our tight schedule,

1653
01:20:58,206 --> 01:21:00,379
we decided to focus on
just a couple of rooms.

1654
01:21:00,482 --> 01:21:03,413
We'll save the dining
room for a future episode.

1655
01:21:03,517 --> 01:21:05,448
Okay, could you stop
zooming for once.

1656
01:21:05,551 --> 01:21:08,103
No, I love your work.
But just relax, thank you.

1657
01:21:08,206 --> 01:21:09,620
Thank you so much for joining us

1658
01:21:09,724 --> 01:21:11,206
on this small tour.

1659
01:21:11,310 --> 01:21:15,896
Not so fast.
I, uh, have a little surprise

1660
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,310
just for you.

1661
01:21:20,758 --> 01:21:23,137
Oh my goodness.

1662
01:21:30,241 --> 01:21:33,931
What? Wow.

1663
01:21:56,344 --> 01:21:58,482
How did... how did you do this?

1664
01:21:58,586 --> 01:22:01,896
- You like it?
- I love it.

1665
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
I'm glad. Gabe and I

1666
01:22:04,103 --> 01:22:07,068
secretly restored the cupboards
and refinished the mantle.

1667
01:22:07,172 --> 01:22:09,793
You almost found
it a couple times.

1668
01:22:11,103 --> 01:22:13,000
The dining room table is
courtesy of

1669
01:22:13,103 --> 01:22:16,103
Andy at Heirloom Antiques.

1670
01:22:16,206 --> 01:22:17,655
- I've heard of it.
- Yeah.

1671
01:22:17,758 --> 01:22:21,206
We were up 'til the
wee hours yesterday.

1672
01:22:21,310 --> 01:22:23,655
I bet.
I mean, how did...

1673
01:22:26,206 --> 01:22:28,827
And you did this all for me?

1674
01:22:28,931 --> 01:22:32,551
Yeah. You deserve it.

1675
01:22:32,655 --> 01:22:35,241
- Welcome home.
- Oh gosh.

1676
01:22:36,275 --> 01:22:37,620
Whoo!

1677
01:22:37,724 --> 01:22:39,689
Merry Christmas, Stella.

1678
01:22:39,793 --> 01:22:41,344
Merry Christmas.

1679
01:22:46,896 --> 01:22:48,655
Finally.

1680
01:22:53,482 --> 01:22:55,103
- Wow.
- Wow.

1681
01:22:55,206 --> 01:22:57,103
I think you just
got another season.

1682
01:23:05,206 --> 01:23:06,803
Our ratings are gonna
be through the roof.

1683
01:23:06,827 --> 01:23:08,872
I feel like we could maybe lock
down a couple-season order, no?

1684
01:23:08,896 --> 01:23:10,655
Oh, now you're pushing things.

1685
01:23:10,758 --> 01:23:12,320
Come on, be content
with just a new season.

1686
01:23:12,344 --> 01:23:14,103
You're right.
And you'll guest star?

1687
01:23:14,206 --> 01:23:15,758
Okay, no, pushing it, I got it.

1688
01:23:15,862 --> 01:23:17,262
- You're so pushing it.
- I'm sorry.

1689
01:23:17,310 --> 01:23:20,379
How about take a moment to
think about how lovely this is

1690
01:23:20,482 --> 01:23:22,379
and how happy and sweet
and in love they are?

1691
01:23:22,482 --> 01:23:24,827
I mean, you come around,
look what happens.

1692
01:23:24,931 --> 01:23:26,068
Ha!

1693
01:23:26,172 --> 01:23:27,793
- So yes?
- No.

1694
01:23:27,896 --> 01:23:29,562
- I feel that you'll come...
- Not happening.

1695
01:23:29,586 --> 01:23:30,931
Okay, I'm done.

1696
01:23:37,827 --> 01:23:41,206
Thanks to Pablo and my family
here at House Sweet Home,

1697
01:23:41,310 --> 01:23:44,103
this house is finally alive
with as much Christmas spirit

1698
01:23:44,206 --> 01:23:46,758
- as it had 100 years ago.
- Finally.

1699
01:23:46,862 --> 01:23:48,620
- It looks fantastic.
- Fantastic.

1700
01:23:48,724 --> 01:23:52,827
And if we're lucky enough to
get picked up for next season,

1701
01:23:52,931 --> 01:23:55,965
Stella and I have a whole
bunch of surprises in store.

1702
01:23:56,068 --> 01:23:57,793
- We do!
- Yeah.

1703
01:23:57,896 --> 01:24:00,413
From our family to
yours, we wish you a...

1704
01:24:00,517 --> 01:24:04,103
Very Merry Christmas!

1705
01:24:07,034 --> 01:24:09,620
And... we're out.

1706
01:24:14,931 --> 01:24:16,448
♪ Just another Christmas song

1707
01:24:16,551 --> 01:24:19,000
♪ But this time
I'll sing along ♪

1708
01:24:21,206 --> 01:24:24,275
So Christmas morning, uh,
Stella got me a present.

1709
01:24:24,379 --> 01:24:27,448
I open it up, and
there's a snow globe

1710
01:24:27,551 --> 01:24:29,413
with a mini sledgehammer inside.

1711
01:24:29,517 --> 01:24:31,862
And on the base it says,
"In case of emergency... "

1712
01:24:31,965 --> 01:24:34,172
- "... break glass."
- Perfect, right?

1713
01:24:34,275 --> 01:24:35,965
Even the box was perfect.

1714
01:24:36,068 --> 01:24:38,551
Perfectly wrapped,
color coordinated.

1715
01:24:38,655 --> 01:24:40,655
What shape was the box,
though, Pablo?

1716
01:24:40,758 --> 01:24:42,517
Was it a square or a rectangle?

1717
01:24:42,620 --> 01:24:44,000
Again with the shapes.

1718
01:24:44,103 --> 01:24:45,251
They don't... they don't
care about stuff like that.

1719
01:24:45,275 --> 01:24:46,827
- It's important!
- Uh...

1720
01:24:46,931 --> 01:24:49,310
Merry Christmas, Stella.

1721
01:24:49,413 --> 01:24:51,448
Merry Christmas.

1722
01:24:52,620 --> 01:24:56,724
Merry Christmas, everybody!
