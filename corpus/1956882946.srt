1
00:01:29,112 --> 00:01:32,216
I thought that we could
build our nest high up...

2
00:01:33,751 --> 00:01:34,852
in the trees.

3
00:01:38,322 --> 00:01:40,323
Fly away, like birds...

4
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,295
to the mountains.

5
00:01:46,034 --> 00:01:53,247
Choir: "And Believed The Lord" from
"Israel In Egypt" by Händel

7
00:01:58,513 --> 00:02:04,933
Footage: Nazi propaganda film
"Triumph of the Will"

5
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,002
Potatoes.
Potatoes.

6
00:04:39,235 --> 00:04:41,036
Oh, we have
so many already.

3
00:05:15,621 --> 00:05:17,464
Hi, Franz
See you!

4
00:05:20,634 --> 00:05:24,256
Don't you want an apple too?
One is plenty. Thanks.

20
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,649
Soundtrack: "A Hidden Life"
by James Newton Howard

7
00:05:40,096 --> 00:05:42,532
Remember
the day when we first met?

8
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,036
You were shy like now.

9
00:05:48,572 --> 00:05:49,673
I remember.

10
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:52,910
That motorcycle.

11
00:05:55,579 --> 00:05:57,180
My best dress.

12
00:06:05,723 --> 00:06:07,124
You looked at me...

13
00:06:10,127 --> 00:06:11,496
and I knew.

14
00:06:20,437 --> 00:06:22,507
How simple life was then.

15
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:31,048
It seemed no trouble
could reach our valley.

16
00:06:36,353 --> 00:06:38,222
We lived above the clouds.

17
00:06:53,937 --> 00:06:56,204
My sister
came to live with us.

18
00:06:56,206 --> 00:06:57,708
He likes you.

19
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:19,297
We had our home.

20
00:07:24,767 --> 00:07:25,969
Your mother,

21
00:07:28,605 --> 00:07:29,940
our family,

22
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:36,614
our village,

23
00:07:39,649 --> 00:07:41,017
Radegund.

24
00:09:31,562 --> 00:09:33,431
Ah!

25
00:10:26,716 --> 00:10:27,918
Dear Fani,

26
00:10:29,285 --> 00:10:32,889
warm greetings to you
from your Franz in training.

27
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:35,225
This week,

28
00:10:35,424 --> 00:10:36,459
I have things easy.

29
00:10:38,062 --> 00:10:40,663
In the mornings,
riding on a motorcycle.

30
00:10:42,131 --> 00:10:43,699
For me,
it's entertaining.

31
00:10:43,701 --> 00:10:45,069
Hello, mountains!

32
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:50,074
I would love
to hear your singing again.

33
00:10:50,874 --> 00:10:52,475
Hello, sun!

34
00:10:52,876 --> 00:10:55,311
I'm looking forward
to our reunion.

35
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,555
I met a fellow here.

36
00:11:05,455 --> 00:11:06,653
His name is Waldland.

37
00:11:06,655 --> 00:11:09,523
How are you doing this?
Well...

38
00:11:09,525 --> 00:11:10,825
In two months of training...

39
00:11:10,827 --> 00:11:12,126
No pretense about him.

40
00:11:12,128 --> 00:11:14,496
I wish that
I could be a little mouse

41
00:11:14,498 --> 00:11:15,564
In the cornfield

42
00:11:15,566 --> 00:11:16,700
Always smiling.

43
00:11:16,966 --> 00:11:19,368
And I
would be out there in the...

44
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:21,104
Sometimes I wish

45
00:11:21,604 --> 00:11:24,000
I could be a little bird...

6
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:29,082
March! Stab!

7
00:11:41,194 --> 00:11:44,658
Move, move! Stab! Move!

8
00:11:56,058 --> 00:11:57,462
Take positions!

46
00:12:14,657 --> 00:12:16,093
My dear husband,

47
00:12:19,361 --> 00:12:21,197
they say that
France has surrendered.

48
00:12:24,868 --> 00:12:26,637
They're
sending farmers home...

49
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,574
for now at least.

50
00:12:35,613 --> 00:12:36,914
Is it true?

51
00:12:44,754 --> 00:12:46,222
Sister's lonely.

52
00:12:48,725 --> 00:12:50,995
I wish
she had someone like you.

53
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:58,168
We could use you here.

54
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,071
To break in the calf.

55
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:11,381
The harvest comes nearer.

56
00:13:14,985 --> 00:13:16,687
We burned the bad weeds.

57
00:13:37,907 --> 00:13:40,177
I got some piglets
from Mossbauer.

58
00:13:42,546 --> 00:13:43,614
Four weeks old.

9
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:51,115
114...
135. Come on, that price is good.

59
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:55,960
With warm greetings
to you...

60
00:13:58,061 --> 00:13:59,530
Your loving wife,

61
00:14:02,365 --> 00:14:03,334
Fani.

10
00:14:26,196 --> 00:14:29,522
Those are fields taken in military campaigns.

11
00:14:29,523 --> 00:14:34,430
Seized by German soldiers.

62
00:15:04,124 --> 00:15:04,660
Oh, my wife,

63
00:15:10,332 --> 00:15:12,535
what's happened to our country?

64
00:15:17,307 --> 00:15:19,043
To the land we love?

65
00:17:31,775 --> 00:17:32,974
Where are the kids?

66
00:17:32,976 --> 00:17:34,344
Inside.

67
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,916
Oh,
Papa's coming for you!

68
00:20:06,829 --> 00:20:07,963
What is it?

69
00:20:14,371 --> 00:20:15,739
I've just been called up.

70
00:20:21,277 --> 00:20:23,447
We thought there would be peace,

71
00:20:24,881 --> 00:20:26,450
but this war goes on.

72
00:20:29,218 --> 00:20:30,821
- I don't know why.
- Shh.

73
00:20:32,288 --> 00:20:34,357
Do you believe
in what we're fighting for?

74
00:20:37,693 --> 00:20:38,729
Not really.

13
00:21:35,561 --> 00:21:37,303
Cheers!

75
00:21:47,395 --> 00:21:49,063
He did what he had to.

76
00:21:49,065 --> 00:21:52,168
He was not content
to watch his nation go under.

77
00:21:52,535 --> 00:21:55,572
Before he came, it all was
in a state of collapse.

78
00:21:57,173 --> 00:21:58,474
A Babylon!

79
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:03,078
We worshipped foreign gods.

80
00:22:03,946 --> 00:22:04,879
You're drunk.

81
00:22:05,146 --> 00:22:06,880
No!

82
00:22:06,882 --> 00:22:11,120
And I am not your friend.
I am your Mayor!

83
00:22:11,386 --> 00:22:12,989
And now they tell us

84
00:22:14,222 --> 00:22:16,526
to spare these other races.

85
00:22:18,228 --> 00:22:19,362
Degraded.

86
00:22:20,063 --> 00:22:24,034
So contemptible they can no
longer despise themselves!

87
00:22:28,403 --> 00:22:30,673
They sow the earth with salt.

88
00:22:34,911 --> 00:22:38,181
Instead of a world,
there is a department store.

89
00:22:38,647 --> 00:22:41,481
Foreigners swarm
over our streets.

90
00:22:41,483 --> 00:22:42,717
Immigrants who don't care

91
00:22:42,719 --> 00:22:45,721
for the past,
only for what they can grab.

92
00:22:46,855 --> 00:22:49,125
This is what happens
when a world...

93
00:22:49,491 --> 00:22:51,060
when a world dies.

94
00:22:51,961 --> 00:22:53,163
Men survive.

95
00:22:54,463 --> 00:22:56,198
But their life is gone.

96
00:22:56,499 --> 00:22:57,698
Their life is gone.

97
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,236
Their reason for living.

14
00:23:06,148 --> 00:23:10,403
Cheers, this is to the new times! Cheers!

98
00:23:20,221 --> 00:23:21,691
The mask is off.

99
00:23:23,425 --> 00:23:25,761
I fear for my family.

100
00:23:30,299 --> 00:23:31,902
Mother's old.

101
00:23:33,769 --> 00:23:34,671
Yeah.

102
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,308
I hope she dies soon.

103
00:23:43,546 --> 00:23:45,849
Don't they know evil
when they see it?

104
00:23:59,327 --> 00:24:01,196
We're used to it now.

105
00:24:04,267 --> 00:24:05,335
Crime.

106
00:24:08,237 --> 00:24:09,469
No shame.

107
00:24:16,078 --> 00:24:17,146
Be careful.

108
00:26:00,015 --> 00:26:02,886
Father, if they call me up,
I can't serve.

109
00:26:03,685 --> 00:26:05,688
We're killing innocent people.

110
00:26:07,757 --> 00:26:09,289
Raiding other countries.

111
00:26:09,291 --> 00:26:10,492
Preying on the weak.

112
00:26:11,193 --> 00:26:14,061
Now the priests call
them heroes, even saints.

113
00:26:14,063 --> 00:26:16,032
The soldiers that do this.

114
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,403
It might be that
the other ones are the heroes.

115
00:26:22,271 --> 00:26:24,838
The ones who defend their
homes against the invaders.

116
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,175
Have you spoken
with anyone else?

117
00:26:27,343 --> 00:26:28,574
- Your wife?
- No.

118
00:26:28,576 --> 00:26:29,712
Family?

119
00:26:34,616 --> 00:26:35,815
Don't you think

120
00:26:35,817 --> 00:26:37,884
you ought to consider
the consequences

121
00:26:37,886 --> 00:26:39,489
of your actions?

122
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:41,124
For them?

123
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,903
You'd almost surely be shot.

124
00:26:57,207 --> 00:26:59,042
Yes.

125
00:27:00,777 --> 00:27:02,144
Your sacrifice

126
00:27:02,711 --> 00:27:04,314
would benefit no one.

127
00:27:14,222 --> 00:27:17,126
I'll speak with the Bishop,
about your case.

128
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:23,831
A wiser man than I.

129
00:27:23,833 --> 00:27:24,934
Thank you.

130
00:27:25,835 --> 00:27:26,970
Thank you.

131
00:27:52,294 --> 00:27:54,330
These last weeks,
you're different.

132
00:28:00,301 --> 00:28:01,270
What is it?

133
00:28:12,848 --> 00:28:15,150
Morning.
God bless.

134
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:19,388
We are collecting
for the war effort.

135
00:28:19,655 --> 00:28:21,456
Hmm. I see.

136
00:28:23,792 --> 00:28:25,327
I'm sorry, I...

137
00:28:30,932 --> 00:28:33,435
Look, as I said,
I don't have anything to give.

138
00:28:33,903 --> 00:28:35,270
I'm...

139
00:28:39,307 --> 00:28:40,343
Please...

140
00:28:41,243 --> 00:28:42,177
No.

141
00:28:50,486 --> 00:28:52,121
I wish you all a good day.

16
00:29:15,083 --> 00:29:17,000
Just let me do it.
I'll speak to him.

17
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,127
He says he is going through hard times.

142
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,988
You have refused to
contribute

143
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:30,460
to our collection
on behalf of the veterans?

144
00:29:32,327 --> 00:29:33,296
Their families?

145
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,150
I also hear
that you have refused

146
00:29:56,152 --> 00:29:58,153
to accept the family allowance,

147
00:29:59,122 --> 00:30:02,258
and other subsidies the state
would have provided you.

148
00:30:03,859 --> 00:30:04,993
Why?

149
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:07,430
Franz. Tell me.

150
00:30:20,009 --> 00:30:21,443
Show a little humor.

151
00:30:22,743 --> 00:30:24,646
Yes.

152
00:30:28,017 --> 00:30:30,385
Nobody refused but you.

153
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:41,230
Please.

154
00:30:43,398 --> 00:30:44,566
Thank you.

18
00:30:48,928 --> 00:30:53,192
Then, what did we come here for?

155
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:43,526
We must be strong.

156
00:31:45,894 --> 00:31:47,262
Stand firm.

157
00:31:53,169 --> 00:31:55,505
Learn the lesson
of the blacksmith.

158
00:32:00,575 --> 00:32:03,078
No matter how hard
the hammer strikes...

159
00:32:06,114 --> 00:32:07,817
the anvil cannot,

160
00:32:09,551 --> 00:32:11,653
need not, strike back.

161
00:32:16,057 --> 00:32:18,594
The anvil outlives the hammer.

162
00:32:25,166 --> 00:32:27,567
That which is hammered
on the anvil,

163
00:32:27,569 --> 00:32:28,703
takes its form,

164
00:32:29,438 --> 00:32:32,508
not only from the hammer,
but the anvil, too.

19
00:32:32,808 --> 00:32:35,121
The Bishop is waiting.

165
00:32:45,953 --> 00:32:47,123
Have a seat.

166
00:32:56,665 --> 00:32:58,100
Your excellency.

167
00:33:00,469 --> 00:33:02,605
Thank you so much
for speaking with me.

168
00:33:06,409 --> 00:33:08,678
If God gives us free will,

169
00:33:10,378 --> 00:33:12,581
we're responsible
for what we do...

170
00:33:13,949 --> 00:33:15,418
what we fail to do...

171
00:33:16,451 --> 00:33:17,452
aren't we?

172
00:33:19,689 --> 00:33:20,790
If our leaders

173
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:23,391
are not good...

174
00:33:25,027 --> 00:33:26,362
if they're evil...

175
00:33:28,063 --> 00:33:29,332
What does one do?

176
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,769
I want to save my life,

177
00:33:35,104 --> 00:33:36,572
but not through lies.

178
00:33:44,913 --> 00:33:47,215
You have a duty
to the Fatherland.

179
00:33:56,125 --> 00:33:57,926
The church tells you so.

180
00:34:07,435 --> 00:34:09,237
Do you know the words

181
00:34:10,371 --> 00:34:11,907
of the apostle?

182
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:20,916
"Let every man be subject

183
00:34:21,916 --> 00:34:24,286
to the powers placed over him."

184
00:34:32,494 --> 00:34:34,563
Do you hear those bells?

185
00:34:37,166 --> 00:34:38,568
They're melting them.

186
00:34:40,735 --> 00:34:42,237
For bullets.

187
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:49,512
I think he was afraid

188
00:34:49,744 --> 00:34:51,213
that I might be a spy.

189
00:34:54,449 --> 00:34:56,483
They don't dare
to commit themselves,

190
00:34:56,485 --> 00:34:58,387
or it could be their turn next.

191
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:25,480
We can't blame
the Bishop for going along.

192
00:35:28,217 --> 00:35:29,918
He hoped, by doing it,

193
00:35:30,619 --> 00:35:34,657
that the regime would be more
tolerant towards the Church.

194
00:35:37,125 --> 00:35:40,429
But now, the priests are sent

195
00:35:40,795 --> 00:35:42,631
to concentration camps.

196
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,635
Church processions banned.

197
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:50,639
We don't have a say.

198
00:35:53,175 --> 00:35:54,543
What can we do?

199
00:35:57,079 --> 00:35:57,980
We,

200
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:01,350
little people here.

201
00:36:23,539 --> 00:36:26,442
Give me
a piece of coal.

202
00:36:27,175 --> 00:36:29,409
- Coal?
- Just one.

203
00:36:29,411 --> 00:36:31,079
- Just one?
- Yeah.

204
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:32,848
Thank you.

205
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:50,766
I paint the tombs
of the prophets.

206
00:36:55,637 --> 00:36:59,342
I help people look up
from those pews and dream.

207
00:37:04,313 --> 00:37:05,480
They look up and...

208
00:37:05,914 --> 00:37:08,782
they imagine that if they
lived back in Christ's time,

209
00:37:08,784 --> 00:37:10,686
they wouldn't have done
what the others did.

210
00:37:12,554 --> 00:37:15,890
They would have murdered
those whom they now adore.

211
00:37:21,096 --> 00:37:25,534
I paint all this suffering,
but I don't suffer myself.

212
00:37:26,434 --> 00:37:27,969
I make a living of it.

213
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:37,146
What we do

214
00:37:38,246 --> 00:37:39,681
is just create

215
00:37:41,349 --> 00:37:42,550
sympathy.

216
00:37:43,351 --> 00:37:44,619
We create...

217
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,655
We create admirers.

218
00:37:50,458 --> 00:37:52,124
We don't create followers.

219
00:37:57,298 --> 00:37:59,601
Christ's life is a demand.

220
00:38:03,338 --> 00:38:05,106
You don't want
to be reminded of it.

221
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:10,512
So we don't have to see
what happens to the truth.

222
00:38:13,215 --> 00:38:14,750
A darker time is coming...

223
00:38:17,284 --> 00:38:19,487
when men will be more clever.

224
00:38:21,523 --> 00:38:23,526
They won't fight the truth.

225
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,762
They'll just ignore it.

226
00:38:35,936 --> 00:38:38,574
I paint
their comfortable Christ,

227
00:38:40,309 --> 00:38:42,011
with a halo over his head.

228
00:38:45,347 --> 00:38:46,715
How can I show

229
00:38:47,282 --> 00:38:49,151
what I haven't lived?

230
00:38:53,355 --> 00:38:55,987
Someday I might have
the courage to venture.

231
00:38:55,989 --> 00:38:57,058
Not yet.

232
00:39:04,365 --> 00:39:05,634
Someday I'll...

233
00:39:06,668 --> 00:39:08,737
I'll paint the true Christ.

22
00:39:30,592 --> 00:39:34,143
- Heil, Hitler!
- Fear Hitler!

234
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:01,923
They won't call you up.

235
00:40:05,492 --> 00:40:07,096
They need farmers.

236
00:40:10,498 --> 00:40:12,567
How else are people
going to eat?

237
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,282
Maybe the war will end soon.

238
00:41:05,652 --> 00:41:08,590
- Is she asleep?
- Yeah.

239
00:41:24,472 --> 00:41:26,808
Why are you
looking at me that way?

240
00:41:31,146 --> 00:41:32,748
It's an act of madness.

241
00:41:34,916 --> 00:41:35,650
A sin...

242
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:38,186
A sin against his family,
against his village.

243
00:42:29,403 --> 00:42:30,905
We're different, Mother.

244
00:42:36,043 --> 00:42:37,378
I'm sorry.

245
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:45,054
But I am grateful to you
for wishing me the best.

246
00:42:54,262 --> 00:42:56,999
Your life was
hard enough already.

247
00:43:22,958 --> 00:43:25,160
His mother
looks at me coldly,

248
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:27,028
like I was to blame.

249
00:43:32,434 --> 00:43:34,002
I want what you want.

250
00:43:34,802 --> 00:43:38,240
But I can't bear
that he makes you suffer.

251
00:43:42,443 --> 00:43:44,313
He makes a choice for you, too.

252
00:43:48,081 --> 00:43:49,817
Does he know what he's doing?

253
00:43:52,454 --> 00:43:53,422
Tell him.

254
00:43:56,423 --> 00:43:57,458
Pride.

255
00:43:57,759 --> 00:43:59,027
It's pride.

256
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,130
That's what it is.

257
00:44:13,875 --> 00:44:15,409
Did they say
something to you?

258
00:44:16,777 --> 00:44:18,980
I saw them speaking
to you by the road.

259
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,362
They said...

260
00:44:38,331 --> 00:44:40,568
...their husbands
have gone off to war.

261
00:44:42,771 --> 00:44:44,539
Why should they fight to...

262
00:44:46,474 --> 00:44:47,509
save us?

263
00:44:56,518 --> 00:44:57,586
Did they hurt you...

264
00:45:00,655 --> 00:45:02,024
with their words?

265
00:45:10,364 --> 00:45:11,399
I don't care.

266
00:46:44,626 --> 00:46:45,527
All good?

267
00:46:46,628 --> 00:46:47,562
Yeah.

268
00:47:11,853 --> 00:47:13,355
You were a wild one.

269
00:47:14,556 --> 00:47:16,490
You fought with the police.

270
00:47:16,958 --> 00:47:19,293
You know, you remember.

271
00:47:20,561 --> 00:47:22,096
Who changed you?

272
00:47:24,898 --> 00:47:26,034
Your wife?

273
00:47:28,836 --> 00:47:30,539
I have sympathy with you.

274
00:47:32,706 --> 00:47:35,242
I don't want anything bad.

275
00:47:35,876 --> 00:47:36,978
I know.

276
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:39,247
So...

277
00:47:40,715 --> 00:47:41,750
Help me.

278
00:47:42,483 --> 00:47:43,751
Radegund loves you.

279
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:50,692
You...

280
00:47:53,027 --> 00:47:54,628
You are a child of Radegund.

281
00:47:59,132 --> 00:48:01,102
I am not your enemy.

282
00:48:03,038 --> 00:48:04,235
I'm your friend.

283
00:48:04,237 --> 00:48:06,240
- Yeah?
- Yes, I am.

284
00:48:09,342 --> 00:48:12,312
You still belong to our people.

285
00:48:12,614 --> 00:48:14,449
You cannot say no

286
00:48:15,416 --> 00:48:16,683
to your race.

287
00:48:17,085 --> 00:48:18,253
And your blood.

288
00:48:19,753 --> 00:48:21,153
And your village.

289
00:48:21,155 --> 00:48:22,757
And your home.

290
00:48:23,724 --> 00:48:25,726
We have to defend our land!

291
00:48:26,527 --> 00:48:28,860
Till he came,
the people were in despair.

292
00:48:28,862 --> 00:48:31,032
Humiliated. In chains.

293
00:48:32,199 --> 00:48:34,735
Who do you think
they will make responsible?

294
00:48:35,369 --> 00:48:36,270
It's me.

295
00:48:37,271 --> 00:48:39,775
Who do you think
they will interrogate?

296
00:48:40,641 --> 00:48:41,976
You'll be hanged!

297
00:48:42,543 --> 00:48:45,010
Do you understand
what that means?

298
00:48:45,012 --> 00:48:46,614
They'll hang you!

299
00:48:46,947 --> 00:48:49,315
Your family, your wife,
your children,

300
00:48:49,317 --> 00:48:51,217
will have no one
to support them.

301
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:53,655
Your mother will die unconsoled!

302
00:49:01,429 --> 00:49:02,431
Calm down.

303
00:49:04,865 --> 00:49:06,134
Don't touch me.

304
00:49:06,934 --> 00:49:07,936
Don't touch me.

305
00:49:12,007 --> 00:49:13,273
You're worse.

306
00:49:13,641 --> 00:49:15,744
You're worse than them!

307
00:49:16,143 --> 00:49:19,113
Because they are enemies,

308
00:49:19,646 --> 00:49:22,616
but you are a traitor!

309
00:49:32,726 --> 00:49:34,261
I've been there, to Vienna.

310
00:49:36,164 --> 00:49:37,666
I saw what happened there.

311
00:49:39,634 --> 00:49:40,367
Lost.

312
00:49:40,735 --> 00:49:42,267
They kicked her
in her face. Bleeding.

313
00:49:42,269 --> 00:49:44,472
Torn from the tent
in which we trusted.

314
00:49:44,739 --> 00:49:47,373
Killing the insane. Children.

315
00:49:47,375 --> 00:49:49,208
Brought to
the King of Terrors.

316
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:50,811
We saw the hate in their eyes.

317
00:49:57,117 --> 00:49:59,784
We've forgotten our
true Fatherland.

318
00:50:36,456 --> 00:50:38,359
[Mayor Kraus:]
What would your father say?

319
00:50:44,365 --> 00:50:45,534
What do you think?

320
00:50:47,101 --> 00:50:49,204
- He fought.
- Mm-hmm.

321
00:50:51,239 --> 00:50:52,840
- He died.
- Yes.

322
00:50:54,041 --> 00:50:56,374
And what do you think
what for he died?

323
00:50:56,376 --> 00:50:58,913
In the trenches, in the mud?

324
00:51:05,019 --> 00:51:06,288
Think about it.

325
00:51:12,793 --> 00:51:13,761
Yeah.

326
00:51:28,175 --> 00:51:29,577
I had a dream.

327
00:51:32,947 --> 00:51:34,079
I saw a train.

328
00:51:38,152 --> 00:51:40,921
The locomotive
was powerful and dark, and...

329
00:51:42,724 --> 00:51:44,326
it drew the children.

330
00:51:46,594 --> 00:51:49,396
And you couldn't see
where it was going, just...

331
00:51:50,998 --> 00:51:53,834
the fields and trees
flashing by.

332
00:52:17,358 --> 00:52:18,927
I hold to a memory.

333
00:52:24,297 --> 00:52:25,599
Of what I knew once.

334
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:40,849
I find no one to turn to.

335
00:52:47,355 --> 00:52:49,057
Nothing enters my soul.

25
00:54:10,627 --> 00:54:15,661
- Let him go in peace!
- Watch out! You dogs!

336
00:54:56,050 --> 00:54:58,486
When have our prayers
not been answered?

337
00:55:11,065 --> 00:55:13,802
If we're faithful to him,
he'll be faithful to us.

338
00:55:28,583 --> 00:55:29,951
I believe it.

339
00:55:37,057 --> 00:55:38,226
We have him.

340
00:55:43,530 --> 00:55:44,699
That's enough.

341
00:56:08,755 --> 00:56:10,757
The whole world is sinking.

342
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:21,835
There's no answer.

343
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:28,175
To follow him...

344
00:56:29,309 --> 00:56:30,844
is insanity.

324
00:56:35,498 --> 00:56:40,636
[from Arvo Pärt: "Tabula Rasa"]

345
00:56:43,389 --> 00:56:45,592
What are you going to do, Franz?

346
00:56:49,563 --> 00:56:52,530
They ask you to take an oath

347
00:56:52,532 --> 00:56:55,133
to the Antichrist.

348
00:56:55,135 --> 00:56:56,704
I know, I know.

349
00:56:57,237 --> 00:56:59,206
It's a life without honor.

350
00:57:03,043 --> 00:57:04,578
Is this here,

351
00:57:05,445 --> 00:57:07,047
the end of the world?

352
00:57:10,550 --> 00:57:12,152
Is this the death

353
00:57:13,021 --> 00:57:14,122
of the light?

354
00:57:30,536 --> 00:57:31,972
We are like a breath.

355
00:57:39,679 --> 00:57:41,882
Like a shadow
that passes away.

356
00:57:43,317 --> 00:57:44,585
Madness!

357
00:58:39,373 --> 00:58:40,708
I've been called up.

358
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:48,416
You could hide
in the woods.

359
00:58:55,523 --> 00:58:56,923
We'll run away!

360
00:58:57,125 --> 00:58:58,192
To the mountains!

361
00:59:27,121 --> 00:59:28,887
Does a man have the right to let

362
00:59:28,889 --> 00:59:31,025
himself be put to death?

363
00:59:34,128 --> 00:59:35,263
For the truth?

364
00:59:38,664 --> 00:59:40,835
Could it possibly please God?

365
00:59:41,702 --> 00:59:43,805
He wants us to have peace.

366
00:59:45,806 --> 00:59:47,175
Happiness.

367
00:59:49,275 --> 00:59:52,846
Not to bring suffering
on ourselves.

368
01:00:03,090 --> 01:00:05,226
We have to
stand up to evil.

369
01:00:15,936 --> 01:00:17,872
You're going to do it,
aren't you?

370
01:02:20,494 --> 01:02:23,030
[Sister Resie:]
Her happiness is in your hands.

371
01:02:25,097 --> 01:02:26,601
She could have had other men.

372
01:02:35,208 --> 01:02:37,577
We have enough troubles
in our lives.

373
01:02:53,126 --> 01:02:55,262
You want too little
for yourself, Fani.

374
01:03:06,739 --> 01:03:08,408
Why don't you oppose him, Fani?

375
01:03:09,476 --> 01:03:10,443
Hmm?

376
01:03:10,811 --> 01:03:11,913
Resist him.

377
01:03:16,315 --> 01:03:18,385
You don't know
what unhappiness is!

378
01:03:21,588 --> 01:03:23,124
Your man never left you.

379
01:03:40,306 --> 01:03:42,242
Oh, okay.

380
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:15,710
You can't change the world.

381
01:04:29,856 --> 01:04:31,458
The world's stronger.

382
01:04:37,431 --> 01:04:38,532
I need you.

383
01:05:31,351 --> 01:05:33,119
You could work
in a hospital.

384
01:05:34,954 --> 01:05:36,590
There's nothing wrong with that.

385
01:05:45,632 --> 01:05:46,567
Is there?

386
01:06:18,764 --> 01:06:20,300
You want to have more?

387
01:07:29,335 --> 01:07:30,904
My dear son.

388
01:07:41,648 --> 01:07:42,750
You're all I have.

389
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:52,893
You know what it is like
to grow up without a father.

390
01:07:59,331 --> 01:08:01,668
I know what it's like
to be alone.

364
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:11,526
[From the St Matthew Passion by Bach]

391
01:08:23,724 --> 01:08:25,156
Girls, your...

392
01:08:25,158 --> 01:08:27,995
Your father is going away.

393
01:08:32,166 --> 01:08:33,567
On a journey.

394
01:08:34,734 --> 01:08:36,536
On a long journey.

395
01:08:37,203 --> 01:08:39,239
He'll be gone for a while.

26
01:08:54,781 --> 01:08:57,051
God bless.

27
01:09:43,933 --> 01:09:47,047
You want to follow the train? Be careful!

28
01:10:58,118 --> 01:11:02,514
Name?

29
01:11:07,831 --> 01:11:14,595
Jägerstätter, Franz.
From Radegund by-the-Danube.

30
01:11:17,345 --> 01:11:18,839
Next one!

31
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:54,000
I swear by God to give the Leader
of the German Reich and people,

31
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Adolf Hitler, supreme commander
of the armed forces,

31
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:01,300
my unconditional obedience.

31
01:12:01,300 --> 01:12:05,000
I shall at all times be prepared

31
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:08,500
(to give my life for this oath.)

396
01:13:19,586 --> 01:13:21,021
My dear wife.

397
01:13:27,194 --> 01:13:28,862
I know you fear for me,

398
01:13:30,596 --> 01:13:32,532
but my burden is light.

32
01:13:34,139 --> 01:13:36,957
This is just a mistake.
A bureaucratic mess. You know?

399
01:13:37,603 --> 01:13:39,402
When I compare my suffering

400
01:13:39,404 --> 01:13:40,907
to that of other people,

33
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
I´m a good person!

401
01:13:43,001 --> 01:13:46,776
I see that mine
is the smallest of crosses.

402
01:13:50,783 --> 01:13:53,252
It is horrible
what they have suffered.

35
01:13:54,519 --> 01:13:58,482
and I don´t want to know
what the fuck I've done,


36
01:13:58,599 --> 01:14:02,600
but they've done bad things.
I don't want to be with these people!

403
01:14:02,662 --> 01:14:04,296
You have to remember

404
01:14:04,363 --> 01:14:06,065
what you knew in a better hour.

37
01:14:08,890 --> 01:14:14,134
And every day it's like this!
Understand? Why me?

38
01:14:23,697 --> 01:14:27,036
[Bosnian] Where's my water,
you son of a bitch?

405
01:14:28,854 --> 01:14:30,222
Spring has come.

406
01:14:33,493 --> 01:14:35,492
My three little girls
will already be

407
01:14:35,494 --> 01:14:37,698
running barefoot,
picking flowers.

408
01:14:42,969 --> 01:14:44,669
It would be better to tell them

409
01:14:44,671 --> 01:14:47,207
where their father is
than to tell them stories.

410
01:14:56,149 --> 01:14:58,986
The fresh green of the grass
is good for a person.

411
01:15:01,988 --> 01:15:04,658
Someone with freedom
might not notice it.

39
01:15:07,201 --> 01:15:09,545
Go on!

40
01:15:18,597 --> 01:15:20,505
Get away from each other!

412
01:15:22,908 --> 01:15:25,043
Greetings to Mother,
to you,

413
01:15:25,377 --> 01:15:26,813
the girls and all.

414
01:15:29,750 --> 01:15:30,951
See you again.

415
01:15:47,699 --> 01:15:49,001
Dear husband.

416
01:15:54,608 --> 01:15:55,973
Greetings in God,

417
01:15:55,975 --> 01:15:58,178
who will make
everything right again.

418
01:16:02,047 --> 01:16:04,283
Greetings from your
three little women.

419
01:16:09,689 --> 01:16:11,054
They say to tell you only

420
01:16:11,056 --> 01:16:13,059
about the good things
they're doing.

421
01:16:13,260 --> 01:16:14,394
Of course.

422
01:16:15,761 --> 01:16:16,927
But I wouldn't surprise you

423
01:16:16,929 --> 01:16:19,132
by telling you
about their disobedience.

424
01:16:23,470 --> 01:16:24,768
Ow!

425
01:16:32,045 --> 01:16:33,980
I have to scold the girls.

426
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:40,020
They're always
demanding my attention.

427
01:16:52,097 --> 01:16:54,935
Rosi's always asking about you.

428
01:16:56,002 --> 01:16:57,771
When we are going to bed,

429
01:16:58,503 --> 01:16:59,506
she says,

430
01:17:00,073 --> 01:17:02,008
"Leave the door unlocked

431
01:17:02,742 --> 01:17:04,411
so Papa can come in."

432
01:17:09,282 --> 01:17:10,350
At meals,

433
01:17:11,516 --> 01:17:13,385
"Save some for Papa."

434
01:17:21,828 --> 01:17:23,530
She sang a song for you.

435
01:17:29,935 --> 01:17:31,438
Wondered if you could hear.

436
01:17:36,208 --> 01:17:39,412
Rosi wanted to take your picture
to bed with her tonight.

437
01:17:43,248 --> 01:17:45,519
You were supposed
to sleep beside her.

438
01:17:49,588 --> 01:17:52,525
I told her that when Father
comes home, he will.

439
01:17:56,863 --> 01:17:58,331
Good night.

440
01:18:13,779 --> 01:18:16,049
Warm greetings
from your loving wife,

441
01:18:20,819 --> 01:18:22,021
Fani.

442
01:18:39,005 --> 01:18:40,472
[Captain Herder:]
You may leave us alone.

443
01:18:42,507 --> 01:18:43,510
Have a seat.

444
01:18:57,355 --> 01:18:59,893
What good do you think
your defiance is doing anyone?

445
01:19:04,229 --> 01:19:06,599
You think it will change
the course of things?

446
01:19:14,073 --> 01:19:16,209
You think the authorities
are aware of you?

447
01:19:17,042 --> 01:19:19,311
That your protests
will come to their attention?

448
01:19:24,917 --> 01:19:27,621
Do you think anyone
will know of it? Ever hear?

449
01:19:30,256 --> 01:19:33,493
No one knows what goes on
behind these walls. No one.

450
01:19:36,828 --> 01:19:38,430
What purpose does it serve?

451
01:19:48,140 --> 01:19:49,307
Does it make no difference

452
01:19:49,309 --> 01:19:51,610
if this war is just or unjust?

453
01:20:00,086 --> 01:20:01,954
You shine their shoes.

454
01:20:10,229 --> 01:20:12,197
You fill their sandbags.

455
01:20:17,436 --> 01:20:18,634
Are you innocent?

42
01:20:24,712 --> 01:20:28,029
Who do you think you are?

43
01:20:34,055 --> 01:20:41,804
What now?
What?... What?... What?

456
01:20:55,774 --> 01:20:56,710
What is it?

457
01:20:57,643 --> 01:20:58,645
Pride?

458
01:21:02,015 --> 01:21:03,583
Are you better than the rest?

459
01:21:05,818 --> 01:21:07,253
Are you alone wise?

460
01:21:12,759 --> 01:21:14,461
How do you know
what is good or bad?

461
01:21:24,270 --> 01:21:25,605
You know better than I?

462
01:21:31,644 --> 01:21:33,213
Did heaven tell you this?

463
01:21:35,081 --> 01:21:36,483
Heard a voice?

464
01:21:44,789 --> 01:21:45,925
There's a difference,

465
01:21:46,125 --> 01:21:48,527
between the kind of suffering
we can't avoid

466
01:21:48,926 --> 01:21:50,529
and the suffering we choose.

45
01:22:05,833 --> 01:22:09,433
Your hands! Your hands up!

467
01:22:13,586 --> 01:22:15,722
You've forgotten
what the world looks like.

468
01:22:19,759 --> 01:22:20,760
The light.

469
01:22:22,127 --> 01:22:23,429
The sky.

470
01:22:37,109 --> 01:22:39,345
I didn't make this world
the way it is.

471
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:42,748
And neither did you.

472
01:22:48,487 --> 01:22:50,690
We all have blood on our hands.

473
01:22:52,759 --> 01:22:54,194
No one is innocent.

474
01:22:55,127 --> 01:22:57,097
Crime, bloodshed everywhere.

475
01:23:03,703 --> 01:23:05,505
He who created this world...

476
01:23:07,073 --> 01:23:08,541
he created evil.

477
01:23:16,682 --> 01:23:20,252
Conscience makes cowards
of us all.

478
01:23:28,694 --> 01:23:30,296
Take care, my friend.

479
01:23:33,032 --> 01:23:34,833
The Antichrist is clever.

480
01:23:38,104 --> 01:23:40,373
He uses a man's virtues...

481
01:23:42,307 --> 01:23:43,807
to mislead him.

482
01:24:40,932 --> 01:24:42,068
Dearest wife...

483
01:24:45,971 --> 01:24:49,039
I leave for Berlin
at 10:13 A.M.

484
01:24:53,145 --> 01:24:54,713
Have no concerns about me.

485
01:24:57,182 --> 01:24:58,551
Pray for me.

46
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:46,898
Get in!

486
01:27:18,189 --> 01:27:19,424
Look down.

487
01:27:24,829 --> 01:27:25,765
Down.

488
01:27:32,837 --> 01:27:33,739
Up.

489
01:28:30,462 --> 01:28:31,831
Dear husband...

490
01:28:36,801 --> 01:28:39,471
Your letter of May 7th
has arrived.

491
01:28:40,405 --> 01:28:41,673
Many thanks.

492
01:29:00,125 --> 01:29:02,127
The well went dry on Thursday.

493
01:29:07,065 --> 01:29:08,634
We need a good rain.

494
01:29:39,465 --> 01:29:41,766
What I feared has come.

495
01:29:44,871 --> 01:29:47,573
I have found no one
to assist with the work,

496
01:29:48,106 --> 01:29:49,274
except for Resie.

497
01:30:09,060 --> 01:30:11,863
Strohofer stole beets
from our field.

498
01:30:20,171 --> 01:30:22,942
I hear nothing
but your voice.

499
01:30:37,689 --> 01:30:39,158
I visited the widow.

500
01:30:40,458 --> 01:30:41,594
Maria.

501
01:30:45,264 --> 01:30:48,231
She hadn't spoken with anyone
in two weeks.

502
01:30:57,876 --> 01:31:00,279
The new hay gives me hope.

503
01:31:03,381 --> 01:31:04,781
The scent in the barn.

504
01:31:08,587 --> 01:31:09,855
The wind.

505
01:31:13,692 --> 01:31:15,094
The wheat.

506
01:31:18,396 --> 01:31:19,664
The sky.

507
01:31:41,654 --> 01:31:44,123
He won't send us more
than we can bear.

508
01:32:59,064 --> 01:33:00,865
Excuse me, can you tell me...

47
01:33:22,778 --> 01:33:25,298
Jägerstätter

509
01:33:43,175 --> 01:33:45,575
[Major Kiel:]
The Colonel must be consulted.

510
01:33:45,577 --> 01:33:47,880
May I meet with him?

511
01:33:51,984 --> 01:33:53,352
A busy man.

512
01:33:54,953 --> 01:33:57,323
But phone, make an appointment.

513
01:33:59,792 --> 01:34:00,956
I've tried to,

514
01:34:00,958 --> 01:34:02,960
but my call isn't answered.

515
01:34:02,962 --> 01:34:04,497
That surprises me.

516
01:34:08,132 --> 01:34:10,402
The problem must be
on your side.

517
01:34:11,168 --> 01:34:13,538
The telephone works
quite well up here.

518
01:34:22,614 --> 01:34:23,648
Then...

519
01:34:23,981 --> 01:34:25,818
how can I make an appointment?

520
01:34:27,719 --> 01:34:29,454
You don't answer my letters.

521
01:34:32,590 --> 01:34:33,956
It took me two days to get here.

522
01:34:33,958 --> 01:34:35,860
It's a very difficult journey.

48
01:35:27,276 --> 01:35:30,075
Out! Eveybody out!

49
01:35:36,588 --> 01:35:41,202
You find it funny, uh?
Eyes on the floor!

50
01:35:44,107 --> 01:35:47,062
- ...broken again!
[insults]

523
01:35:48,466 --> 01:35:49,634
Most beloved wife...

524
01:35:52,136 --> 01:35:55,206
Once again, warm greetings
from your loving husband.

525
01:36:10,956 --> 01:36:12,591
I'll write a few words,

526
01:36:12,925 --> 01:36:14,960
just as they come from my heart.

527
01:36:18,396 --> 01:36:21,099
Even though I am writing them
with bound hands,

528
01:36:21,632 --> 01:36:24,469
it's still better than
if my will were bound.

51
01:36:25,129 --> 01:36:29,949
Show me your hands.
Hold up your hands.

52
01:36:32,506 --> 01:36:38,109
Do you understand me?

529
01:36:44,555 --> 01:36:45,556
These men...

530
01:36:46,858 --> 01:36:48,360
have no friends.

531
01:36:52,630 --> 01:36:55,167
No loving hand to hold theirs.

532
01:36:57,234 --> 01:36:58,670
What are you here for?

533
01:36:59,938 --> 01:37:01,140
Treason.

534
01:37:02,306 --> 01:37:04,108
They've seen sorrow.

535
01:37:05,877 --> 01:37:07,046
Shame.

536
01:37:08,980 --> 01:37:10,349
Destruction.

537
01:37:18,222 --> 01:37:20,125
What strong hearts.

53
01:37:31,276 --> 01:37:34,715
"Talking forbidden!"

54
01:37:41,023 --> 01:37:43,531
Bausthulter. High treason.

55
01:37:45,815 --> 01:37:47,800
Jägerstätter.
Undermining of military morale.

538
01:37:54,059 --> 01:37:55,391
When you give up the idea

539
01:37:55,393 --> 01:37:57,596
of surviving at any price...

540
01:38:01,832 --> 01:38:04,135
a new light floods in.

541
01:38:09,073 --> 01:38:11,042
Once you were in a rush...

542
01:38:12,143 --> 01:38:14,212
always short of time.

543
01:38:19,051 --> 01:38:20,753
Now you have all you need.

544
01:38:29,226 --> 01:38:31,596
Once you never
forgave anyone...

545
01:38:33,998 --> 01:38:35,964
judged people without mercy.

546
01:38:40,371 --> 01:38:43,074
Now you see
your own weakness...

547
01:38:44,609 --> 01:38:47,445
so you can understand
the weakness of others.

56
01:39:00,432 --> 01:39:03,496
Jägerstätter!

548
01:42:35,006 --> 01:42:36,007
Do you think...

549
01:42:39,810 --> 01:42:41,012
I did this?

550
01:42:46,016 --> 01:42:47,685
He used to be different.

551
01:42:51,456 --> 01:42:53,625
He changed when he met you.

552
01:43:24,087 --> 01:43:25,487
My dear children...

553
01:43:28,859 --> 01:43:33,262
I thought of you especially,
Corpus Christi Sunday.

554
01:43:44,074 --> 01:43:45,277
The bells ringing

555
01:43:45,543 --> 01:43:47,010
over the fields.

556
01:43:49,881 --> 01:43:51,714
I would have loved
to have seen you

557
01:43:51,716 --> 01:43:53,585
with your crowns of flowers.

558
01:43:59,256 --> 01:44:01,126
Your devoted father greets you,

559
01:44:03,028 --> 01:44:04,463
from far away.

58
01:44:25,476 --> 01:44:28,069
Traitors to the German cause!

59
01:44:28,070 --> 01:44:34,541
We are under pressure,
because of what you did!

60
01:44:35,406 --> 01:44:37,143
Shame on you!

61
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,351
You deserve...

61
01:44:40,951 --> 01:44:43,351
to be executed!

62
01:44:43,979 --> 01:44:51,890
Yeah, they should come here.
Yeah, they should hang you!

560
01:44:54,110 --> 01:44:55,544
Dear husband...

63
01:44:56,416 --> 01:44:57,416
Traitors to the German cause!

561
01:44:58,216 --> 01:45:00,819
Loving greetings to you
on this Sunday.

562
01:45:04,454 --> 01:45:06,289
We're all concerned about you.

64
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:10,000
Leave us alone!

563
01:45:10,028 --> 01:45:11,059
Hopefully,

564
01:45:11,061 --> 01:45:12,963
things are not going poorly.

565
01:45:16,768 --> 01:45:18,636
The girls send greetings.

566
01:45:23,073 --> 01:45:26,076
Loisi says they will give you
kisses together.

567
01:45:32,449 --> 01:45:34,586
I'm always with you in thought.

568
01:45:59,810 --> 01:46:01,613
I can go to Salzburg.

569
01:46:12,456 --> 01:46:14,358
Papa offered to come with me.

66
01:46:17,305 --> 01:46:19,675
Good morning.

570
01:46:25,436 --> 01:46:27,605
Fear overcomes me.

571
01:46:30,307 --> 01:46:31,975
I know it should not.

572
01:46:36,747 --> 01:46:39,584
Trust in the triumph
of the good.

573
01:46:45,555 --> 01:46:48,092
No evil can happen
to a good man.

574
01:46:54,899 --> 01:46:57,002
Not a sparrow falls to Earth,

575
01:46:58,000 --> 01:46:59,000
but he knows it.

66
01:46:59,300 --> 01:47:02,500
I have no information.

67
01:47:04,231 --> 01:47:06,817
Thank you.

576
01:47:29,300 --> 01:47:30,668
I'm sorry.

577
01:47:39,143 --> 01:47:40,612
A father...

578
01:47:41,112 --> 01:47:42,646
loves his child.

579
01:47:46,283 --> 01:47:47,351
A father

580
01:47:48,351 --> 01:47:50,220
wants his child to be happy.

581
01:47:51,488 --> 01:47:53,357
For life not to touch her.

582
01:47:58,363 --> 01:47:59,631
And you...

583
01:48:05,202 --> 01:48:06,771
such a good child.

584
01:48:10,307 --> 01:48:11,676
Franz, too.

585
01:48:17,881 --> 01:48:20,884
Better to suffer injustice
than to do it.

586
01:49:22,747 --> 01:49:24,646
[Attorney Feldman:]
I've been appointed by the court

587
01:49:24,648 --> 01:49:26,284
to be your defense attorney.

588
01:49:28,720 --> 01:49:30,486
As I understand,
your resistance is

589
01:49:30,488 --> 01:49:32,891
specifically to serving
in combat.

590
01:49:34,057 --> 01:49:36,795
But I believe if you were
to accept medical service,

591
01:49:37,429 --> 01:49:39,029
you would work

592
01:49:40,064 --> 01:49:42,833
as an orderly in a hospital,
that sort of thing.

593
01:49:43,768 --> 01:49:46,371
They would probably
drop these charges.

594
01:49:53,444 --> 01:49:56,214
Will I be required
to swear loyalty to Hitler?

595
01:49:56,447 --> 01:49:57,148
Oh, words!

596
01:49:57,648 --> 01:49:59,884
I mean, no one takes that
sort of thing seriously. Hmm?

597
01:50:02,420 --> 01:50:03,387
I can't.

598
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:11,963
You are a stubborn man.

599
01:50:15,233 --> 01:50:19,302
See here, I am going to
leave this paper with you.

600
01:50:19,304 --> 01:50:20,739
Keep it with you.

601
01:50:21,104 --> 01:50:22,005
Sign,

602
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:24,242
and you will go free.

603
01:50:26,243 --> 01:50:27,411
But I am free.

604
01:50:32,216 --> 01:50:34,318
So... why am I here?

605
01:50:39,256 --> 01:50:40,423
I don't know.

606
01:50:49,266 --> 01:50:50,268
You...

607
01:50:51,569 --> 01:50:52,871
my shepherd.

608
01:51:03,413 --> 01:51:06,416
You make me lie down
in green pastures.

68
01:51:09,928 --> 01:51:12,857
[priest visiting prisoners]
Do you want to talk?

609
01:51:13,423 --> 01:51:15,225
By the river of life.

610
01:51:28,805 --> 01:51:30,007
You...

611
01:51:32,743 --> 01:51:34,112
my strength.

612
01:51:38,682 --> 01:51:40,385
You show me the path.

613
01:51:47,457 --> 01:51:48,525
You...

614
01:51:51,828 --> 01:51:53,264
our light.

615
01:51:58,502 --> 01:52:01,139
Darkness is not dark to you.

616
01:52:07,711 --> 01:52:09,914
Bring us to your eternal light.

617
01:52:14,685 --> 01:52:15,887
To you.

618
01:52:19,355 --> 01:52:20,425
The true.

619
01:52:25,029 --> 01:52:27,031
The never-failing light.

620
01:52:41,546 --> 01:52:43,146
You call me your brother.

621
01:52:56,560 --> 01:52:57,562
Father.

622
01:53:02,367 --> 01:53:04,068
To you I cry.

623
01:53:10,307 --> 01:53:11,376
My rock.

624
01:53:15,445 --> 01:53:16,613
My fortress.

625
01:53:19,750 --> 01:53:21,652
I can do as I like with you.

626
01:53:22,185 --> 01:53:24,919
Nobody would know.
Nobody would care.

627
01:53:24,921 --> 01:53:27,291
Nobody'd lift a hand
to stop me.

628
01:53:35,867 --> 01:53:36,932
Who sees us?

629
01:53:47,778 --> 01:53:49,380
Give me strength.

630
01:53:54,819 --> 01:53:56,120
To follow you.

631
01:54:02,993 --> 01:54:04,228
Spirit...

632
01:54:12,936 --> 01:54:14,204
Lead me.

633
01:54:17,942 --> 01:54:19,210
Show me.

634
01:55:01,418 --> 01:55:02,420
Lord...

635
01:55:15,164 --> 01:55:16,768
You do nothing.

636
01:55:58,309 --> 01:55:59,710
Where are you?

637
01:56:12,189 --> 01:56:14,555
Why did you create us?

638
01:57:09,179 --> 01:57:10,411
Have the persecuted

639
01:57:10,413 --> 01:57:12,716
received the kingdom
of heaven?

640
01:57:22,326 --> 01:57:24,529
The meek inherited
the earth?

641
01:57:31,002 --> 01:57:33,304
The wise deceive us.

642
01:57:33,936 --> 01:57:35,405
Afraid.

643
01:57:35,872 --> 01:57:37,240
Oh...

644
01:57:38,408 --> 01:57:40,510
I was once like you.

645
01:57:46,250 --> 01:57:47,518
Confess it.

646
01:57:50,354 --> 01:57:52,423
Your God has no pity.

647
01:57:53,757 --> 01:57:56,592
He left us. Abandoned us.

648
01:57:56,893 --> 01:57:58,496
Like he did your Christ.

649
01:57:58,862 --> 01:57:59,931
His son!

650
01:58:09,605 --> 01:58:12,609
How far we are
from having our daily bread.

651
01:58:15,244 --> 01:58:17,245
How far from being delivered

652
01:58:17,247 --> 01:58:18,516
from evil!

653
01:58:29,859 --> 01:58:34,396
If we could only see
the beginning of his kingdom.

654
01:58:37,367 --> 01:58:38,735
The dawn!

655
01:58:41,171 --> 01:58:43,007
But...

656
01:58:45,943 --> 01:58:47,011
Nothing.

657
01:58:50,213 --> 01:58:51,582
Nothing ever!

658
01:58:55,519 --> 01:58:57,986
Why give your life for them?

69
01:59:02,700 --> 01:59:04,768
Quit talking and move along!

659
01:59:08,966 --> 01:59:10,868
Your man died in vain.

660
01:59:14,037 --> 01:59:15,037
He came.

661
01:59:15,505 --> 01:59:17,507
And it was all for nothing.

662
01:59:51,609 --> 01:59:54,512
We had 20 centuries
of failure.

663
01:59:55,679 --> 01:59:58,048
We need a successful saint.

664
02:01:01,112 --> 02:01:02,046
Oh, yeah.

665
02:01:04,047 --> 02:01:05,515
No one will help us,

666
02:01:06,516 --> 02:01:08,418
well, we do it on our own.

667
02:01:10,220 --> 02:01:11,422
Sister?

668
02:01:15,359 --> 02:01:16,727
Yes.

669
02:01:46,622 --> 02:01:48,525
Come on.

670
02:02:00,235 --> 02:02:01,137
Okay.

671
02:02:01,872 --> 02:02:02,840
Yeah.

672
02:03:23,086 --> 02:03:24,188
Dear wife,

673
02:03:28,057 --> 02:03:31,662
I still can't say
how my future will unfold.

674
02:03:35,666 --> 02:03:38,202
What comes next is
seldom better.

675
02:03:40,603 --> 02:03:43,606
And still,
now begins the month of June.

676
02:03:45,576 --> 02:03:47,211
The most beautiful month.

677
02:03:51,381 --> 02:03:53,415
Nature does not notice
the sorrow

678
02:03:53,417 --> 02:03:55,119
that has come over the people.

679
02:03:57,921 --> 02:03:59,687
Though I cannot see much here,

680
02:03:59,689 --> 02:04:01,358
I imagine that everything

681
02:04:01,557 --> 02:04:04,862
is a more lovely green
than in past years.

682
02:04:17,875 --> 02:04:18,774
At dawn,

683
02:04:19,275 --> 02:04:23,113
we can hear blackbirds singing
loudly outside our windows.

684
02:04:27,917 --> 02:04:29,720
They seem to have more freedom

685
02:04:30,319 --> 02:04:32,988
and to know more of
peace and happiness,

686
02:04:33,622 --> 02:04:36,259
though they are
only unreasoning animals

687
02:04:37,161 --> 02:04:38,761
than we humans do.

688
02:04:39,962 --> 02:04:43,067
We, who have the gift
of understanding.

689
02:05:02,452 --> 02:05:04,686
You gave me back more
than I gave you.

690
02:05:26,809 --> 02:05:28,345
I found a fellow here

691
02:05:30,447 --> 02:05:31,981
from my training days.

692
02:05:33,216 --> 02:05:34,118
Franz?

693
02:05:36,086 --> 02:05:37,054
Franz!

694
02:05:37,753 --> 02:05:38,956
Look at you.

695
02:05:41,658 --> 02:05:43,593
What have you done?
You're a criminal!

696
02:05:43,893 --> 02:05:46,529
He lifts the spirits
of the other fellows.

697
02:05:46,962 --> 02:05:48,398
We're getting on just fine.

698
02:05:49,832 --> 02:05:52,134
Good, bad, together.

699
02:05:52,769 --> 02:05:54,905
He asks about our family.

700
02:05:55,405 --> 02:05:56,673
Don't you worry.

701
02:05:57,341 --> 02:05:58,540
Trouble lasts a day.

702
02:05:58,542 --> 02:05:59,973
Yeah, eat. Eat. Eat.

703
02:05:59,975 --> 02:06:01,911
- Is that all you have?
- Yeah.

704
02:06:09,953 --> 02:06:12,089
Have you heard
of the Scharfrichter?

705
02:06:14,724 --> 02:06:16,427
The one who chops off your head?

706
02:06:22,398 --> 02:06:24,067
He's a very well-dressed man.

707
02:06:24,266 --> 02:06:25,868
He comes and he has a...

708
02:06:27,104 --> 02:06:28,137
a big hat.

709
02:06:28,771 --> 02:06:30,440
He is a man of good taste.

710
02:06:31,807 --> 02:06:34,344
He cuts your head,
but it's a clean cut,

711
02:06:34,543 --> 02:06:36,412
and before
you can think a thought,

712
02:06:36,680 --> 02:06:38,148
just...

713
02:07:07,444 --> 02:07:08,912
I wonder how it feels.

714
02:07:10,313 --> 02:07:14,014
Maybe your body's old,
your head is young,

715
02:07:14,016 --> 02:07:16,052
and you see
your head flying away.

716
02:07:16,587 --> 02:07:17,954
And your old arms...

717
02:07:18,287 --> 02:07:19,521
they reach up

718
02:07:19,823 --> 02:07:21,125
to the head.

719
02:07:22,391 --> 02:07:24,193
And they're still in chains.

720
02:07:26,429 --> 02:07:29,032
And you take this young head...

721
02:07:31,768 --> 02:07:35,038
and you put it back
on your body.

722
02:07:36,773 --> 02:07:38,475
And you open your eyes...

723
02:07:40,542 --> 02:07:42,345
and the chains are gone!

724
02:07:46,382 --> 02:07:47,451
But what happens then?

725
02:07:53,457 --> 02:07:55,057
Maybe you'll see the moon.

726
02:07:58,427 --> 02:07:59,563
Or the stars.

727
02:08:14,476 --> 02:08:16,313
You know, even if it rains,

728
02:08:16,947 --> 02:08:18,414
the sun is shining.

729
02:08:22,351 --> 02:08:23,252
The sun

730
02:08:23,587 --> 02:08:25,088
shines on good

731
02:08:25,521 --> 02:08:26,523
and evil

732
02:08:26,789 --> 02:08:27,925
the same.

733
02:08:46,109 --> 02:08:47,642
There are more chains

734
02:08:47,644 --> 02:08:49,046
than mad dogs.

735
02:09:44,234 --> 02:09:46,169
I wish I'd had a wife.

736
02:09:47,869 --> 02:09:49,238
And a farm.

737
02:09:52,108 --> 02:09:53,677
And apple trees.

738
02:09:54,677 --> 02:09:56,078
And a cherry tree.

739
02:09:56,912 --> 02:09:58,114
And...

740
02:09:59,114 --> 02:10:00,716
maybe some grapes.

741
02:10:01,251 --> 02:10:03,052
We could do our own wine.

742
02:10:05,255 --> 02:10:06,056
White wine.

743
02:10:06,256 --> 02:10:10,093
And red wine.
One red wine for the winter.

744
02:10:10,792 --> 02:10:13,663
And white wine for the summer.

745
02:10:14,930 --> 02:10:16,565
We would not drink too much.

746
02:10:17,466 --> 02:10:19,567
We would pray. And work.

747
02:10:19,569 --> 02:10:20,367
But sometimes...

748
02:10:20,369 --> 02:10:22,338
Sometimes, a little drink
is good.

749
02:10:24,606 --> 02:10:25,609
Sometimes...

750
02:10:27,109 --> 02:10:28,679
we would go to church.

751
02:10:29,979 --> 02:10:32,215
And sometimes not. Sometimes...

752
02:10:32,948 --> 02:10:34,417
we'd stay at home.

753
02:10:37,086 --> 02:10:38,622
And we'd make music.

71
02:12:14,285 --> 02:12:15,487
Franz Jägerstätter.

71
02:12:15,487 --> 02:12:18,487
Driver at the headquarters of
the reserve motorized brigade in Enns.

72
02:12:18,487 --> 02:12:22,694
Born on May 20th, 1907
in Radegund-on-the-Danube.

73
02:12:22,858 --> 02:12:26,396
Currently in custody at the Werhrmacht´s
preventive prison in Berlin-Tegel.

74
02:12:26,397 --> 02:12:31,730
He refused again to comply with the
conscription laws of February 24th, 1935

75
02:12:31,730 --> 02:12:39,099
regarding his active duty service
at the 17th motorized brigade in Enns.

75
02:12:39,730 --> 02:12:43,099
The defendant failed to...

754
02:13:05,301 --> 02:13:07,268
Do you have anything to say

755
02:13:07,270 --> 02:13:08,805
in your defense?

76
02:13:16,960 --> 02:13:21,116
Stop being so insolent!
Who do you think you are?

77
02:13:21,116 --> 02:13:25,089
You are being a coward!
You're acting the martyr!

78
02:13:25,181 --> 02:13:30,460
You rejected your duty, while all of us
fulfill our duties, to save your life!

756
02:13:39,202 --> 02:13:41,304
We'll have
a short recess.

757
02:13:57,987 --> 02:13:59,355
Come in.

758
02:14:07,296 --> 02:14:08,664
Please, uh...

759
02:14:21,243 --> 02:14:22,612
Sit down.

760
02:14:23,112 --> 02:14:24,346
Thank you.

761
02:14:28,850 --> 02:14:31,418
Do you imagine
that anything you do

762
02:14:31,420 --> 02:14:34,457
will change
the course of this war?

763
02:14:36,024 --> 02:14:40,496
That anyone outside this court
will ever hear of you?

764
02:14:43,432 --> 02:14:45,502
No one will be changed.

765
02:14:47,536 --> 02:14:49,838
The world will go on as before.

766
02:15:01,484 --> 02:15:04,250
Your actions may even
have the opposite effect

767
02:15:04,252 --> 02:15:05,721
of what you intend.

768
02:15:08,390 --> 02:15:11,493
Someone else
will take your place.

769
02:15:23,139 --> 02:15:25,442
Do you judge me?

770
02:15:30,712 --> 02:15:31,747
I don't judge you.

771
02:15:35,752 --> 02:15:36,951
I'm not saying,

772
02:15:36,953 --> 02:15:38,121
"He's wicked.

773
02:15:38,354 --> 02:15:39,555
I am right."

774
02:15:42,225 --> 02:15:43,627
I don't know everything.

775
02:15:52,234 --> 02:15:53,335
A man...

776
02:15:54,804 --> 02:15:55,904
may do wrong.

777
02:15:59,274 --> 02:16:00,376
And...

778
02:16:01,978 --> 02:16:03,512
he can't get out of it.

779
02:16:04,881 --> 02:16:06,516
To make his life clear.

780
02:16:10,752 --> 02:16:14,056
Maybe... he'd like to go back
but he can't.

781
02:16:16,993 --> 02:16:17,994
But...

782
02:16:22,131 --> 02:16:24,667
I have this feeling
inside me...

783
02:16:28,871 --> 02:16:30,340
...that I can't do

784
02:16:31,140 --> 02:16:32,641
what I believe is wrong.

785
02:16:46,488 --> 02:16:48,725
Do you have
a right to do this?

786
02:16:51,261 --> 02:16:53,029
Do I have a right not to?

787
02:17:47,850 --> 02:17:50,854
The judgment
of this court is...

788
02:17:52,254 --> 02:17:53,456
death.

789
02:18:20,916 --> 02:18:23,719
So today
they pronounced the sentence.

790
02:18:27,957 --> 02:18:29,192
But they still

791
02:18:29,992 --> 02:18:31,628
have to confirm it.

792
02:18:35,331 --> 02:18:36,964
Sign the paper in your cell.

793
02:18:36,966 --> 02:18:39,068
You'll go free.
I can work it out.

79
02:19:30,882 --> 02:19:40,304
[Psalm 55]
Give ear to my prayer, O God;
Do not hide yourself from my pleas!

80
02:19:43,548 --> 02:19:52,424
Attend to me, and answer me:
I am restless, and I mourn;

80
02:19:53,048 --> 02:20:00,424
The wicked bring suffering on me; 
they assail me in anger.

81
02:20:03,103 --> 02:20:06,220
My heart is in anguish within me;

81
02:20:06,220 --> 02:20:14,220
The terrors of death,
fear and trembling have beset me.

81
02:20:15,103 --> 02:20:17,220
"Dear father,
come soon!"

794
02:20:51,734 --> 02:20:53,569
It's from his lawyer!

795
02:21:09,550 --> 02:21:11,587
They've
condemned him to death.

796
02:21:15,858 --> 02:21:17,693
I have to go to Berlin.

797
02:21:20,797 --> 02:21:22,031
I'll come with you.

798
02:23:56,317 --> 02:23:57,486
Franz!

799
02:24:54,909 --> 02:24:57,112
You're doing no one any good.

800
02:25:00,415 --> 02:25:01,483
No one.

801
02:25:05,420 --> 02:25:08,356
This could be the last
opportunity to abandon this...

802
02:25:11,527 --> 02:25:13,262
senseless position.

803
02:25:14,663 --> 02:25:15,965
If you do...

804
02:25:16,264 --> 02:25:17,031
Franz.

805
02:25:17,299 --> 02:25:19,132
...I will at once
petition the court

806
02:25:19,134 --> 02:25:21,134
to stay the execution
of your sentence,

807
02:25:21,136 --> 02:25:22,939
but it must be done
without delay.

808
02:25:23,672 --> 02:25:25,041
Do you understand?

809
02:25:26,709 --> 02:25:27,844
Now.

810
02:25:31,345 --> 02:25:34,279
I'm sticking
my neck out here.

811
02:25:34,281 --> 02:25:35,584
This could jeopardize
my career...

812
02:25:37,019 --> 02:25:38,387
my personal safety.

813
02:25:41,323 --> 02:25:44,393
The charges would be dropped,
I'm sure, if you just...

814
02:25:45,394 --> 02:25:46,996
change your stand.

815
02:25:47,563 --> 02:25:48,597
I beg you to.

816
02:25:50,532 --> 02:25:52,501
The war may soon be over.

817
02:25:53,668 --> 02:25:54,904
You might...

818
02:25:56,237 --> 02:25:58,572
You might never
have to face a situation

819
02:25:58,574 --> 02:26:01,244
that would call on you
to do what you oppose.

820
02:26:02,778 --> 02:26:04,146
My love.

821
02:26:07,082 --> 02:26:08,251
Franz.

822
02:26:10,818 --> 02:26:12,354
Don't you see what's coming?

823
02:26:19,060 --> 02:26:20,529
There's not much time!

824
02:26:22,531 --> 02:26:25,568
God doesn't care what you say,
only what's in your heart.

825
02:26:28,370 --> 02:26:30,573
Say the oath
and think what you like.

826
02:26:47,923 --> 02:26:49,292
Do you understand?

799
02:26:55,959 --> 02:27:05,431
["Agnus Dei" by Wojciech Kilar]

827
02:27:14,750 --> 02:27:16,118
I love you.

828
02:27:21,756 --> 02:27:23,158
Whatever you do.

829
02:27:26,528 --> 02:27:27,595
Whatever...

830
02:27:28,496 --> 02:27:29,397
comes.

831
02:27:35,704 --> 02:27:37,105
I'm with you.

832
02:27:41,743 --> 02:27:42,745
Always.

833
02:27:59,861 --> 02:28:01,397
Do what is right.

834
02:28:23,385 --> 02:28:26,522
No! Let me go!

835
02:29:40,862 --> 02:29:42,197
You said,

836
02:29:42,564 --> 02:29:43,498
"Knock.

837
02:29:45,100 --> 02:29:46,801
It will be opened.

838
02:29:49,570 --> 02:29:50,638
Ask.

839
02:29:53,041 --> 02:29:54,508
It will be given."

840
02:32:59,193 --> 02:33:00,862
You've always been good to me.

841
02:33:02,698 --> 02:33:03,832
And to my son.

842
02:33:04,665 --> 02:33:05,634
And I've...

843
02:33:15,175 --> 02:33:16,545
Forgive me!

844
02:34:21,141 --> 02:34:22,144
You.

845
02:34:25,579 --> 02:34:27,750
You love him more than I do.

846
02:34:37,425 --> 02:34:38,960
Give him courage.

847
02:34:41,462 --> 02:34:42,663
Wisdom.

848
02:34:46,400 --> 02:34:47,602
Strength.

849
02:35:09,356 --> 02:35:10,626
Father...

850
02:35:24,105 --> 02:35:25,907
Tomorrow it will be done.

851
02:35:44,325 --> 02:35:45,693
Thank you, Father.

Now, my dear children...

853
02:36:37,545 --> 02:36:39,915
When mother
reads this letter to you,

854
02:36:41,415 --> 02:36:43,117
your father will be dead.

855
02:36:46,987 --> 02:36:49,891
Through God's grace
we'll soon meet again.

Dearest wife and mother...

857
02:37:06,641 --> 02:37:10,242
It was not possible for me
to free you from the sorrows

858
02:37:10,244 --> 02:37:11,712
that you've endured for me.

don't forget me
in your prayers.

862
02:37:26,527 --> 02:37:28,129
I pray for you.

Sit down!    

864
02:38:58,486 --> 02:38:59,754

Shh.

847
02:40:55,000 --> 02:40:58,000
As in heaven,
so on earth

847
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:01,500
Give us our daily bread

847
02:41:01,500 --> 02:41:06,000
Forgive us our guilt,
as we forgive those indebted to us

847
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:09,000
And lead us not into temptation

847
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:12,000
But deliver us from evil

847
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:15,000
