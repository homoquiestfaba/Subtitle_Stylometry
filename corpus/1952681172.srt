1
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:39,765
As we celebrate the birth
of our great country...

2
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,806
...we have the opportunity
to demonstrate our own independence....

3
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:11,894
Hi, honey.

4
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:15,199
Yeah. I pretty much just got here.

5
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:16,800
Pretty much.

6
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:19,801
That's why I'm not in town.

7
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:23,003
I'm caIIing you now. Shit.

8
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,978
No, I just.... Shit!

9
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:33,374
...almost identical,
with morning lows in the high 70s...

10
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,647
...and afternoon highs in the upper 90s.

11
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:39,286
That's perfect picnic weather
for this sunny lndependence Day.

12
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:45,325
-Jesse. Today's the big day.
-Yep.

13
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:49,025
-You gonna get it right this time?
-I hope so.

14
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,231
Well, he's done it again.
Another financial institution...

15
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,274
...has fallen victim to his theatrics.

16
00:02:56,609 --> 00:03:00,170
For the latest on this story,
we go to Cindy Vargas in Cerritos.

17
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:05,510
This is the 10th bank in as many months
to be robbed in this fashion.

18
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,979
Federal authorities believe these heists...

19
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:12,251
...to be the work of a single perpetrator
and have dubbed him ''Hamlet''...

20
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:15,359
...due to the unusual way
in which he performs.

21
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:19,030
lt seems he has a flair for Shakespeare...

22
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:22,531
...and apparently he's getting
some rave reviews.

23
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:27,300
l ain't no expert on Shakespeare,
but he was pretty damn good.

24
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,503
The FBl has traced his ill-gotten gains...

25
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:34,545
...to a number of charities
across the country.

26
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:38,449
The search for Hamlet continues.

27
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:43,918
For KGAB, this is Cindy Vargas
reporting live from Cerritos.

28
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:53,592
-That'II put some hair on your chest.
-You oughta pour some over your head.

29
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:57,397
Go fuck yourseIf, BiIIy.
You get any acting work yet?

30
00:03:57,503 --> 00:04:00,631
If I ever get desperate,
I can aIways become a divorce attorney.

31
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:04,106
-Beats the shit out of waiting tabIes.
-I'm not a fucking waiter!

32
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:07,044
To undying friendship.

33
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:12,676
-No.
-Come on.

34
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:13,852
Teddy?

35
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:17,347
Yeah, you know what she says
about Iiquor with me: ''No.''

36
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:19,987
Your dad know you're back in town?

37
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,390
No, not yet.

38
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:25,197
-How is the oId bastard?
-I don't want to taIk about him.

39
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:27,960
Let's taIk about something I care about.

40
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:38,135
How Iong has he been in there, anyways?

41
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,805
Ask SoI.

42
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:44,742
What the heII is that supposed to mean?

43
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:48,281
I sIeep fine at night, okay?
I have a cIear conscience.

44
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:51,217
It's okay, SoI.
I'm sure he doesn't hoId it against you.

45
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:53,884
What's three years of a man's Iife, right?

46
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:58,555
There he is.

47
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,601
Thank you, CahiII.
That's very sweet of you.

48
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,703
See you soon.

49
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:20,716
Do I know you guys?

50
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:25,418
So, you famous yet?

51
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,620
-I'm working on it.
-We're working on it.

52
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:32,393
-Good to see you.
-Teddy! Come here.

53
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,665
How's things?

54
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:39,101
-PredictabIe.
-PredictabIe. Buzzard?

55
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,967
What do you think?

56
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:45,477
You got two in the tower
with Ruger Mini-14s...

57
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:48,604
...30-round mags, 5.56-caIiber,
fuII metaI jacket.

58
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:52,213
One on the perimeter
with a Remington 870 pump...

59
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:54,616
...12-gauge, doubIe-ought buckshot.

60
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:56,444
What about you?

61
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:59,091
HK, USP, 9-miIIimeter...

62
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:04,823
...and for those speciaI occasions,
we have a IoveIy WaIther PPK.

63
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,923
You're packing?

64
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:10,634
CouId you say it Iouder?
I'm not sure the guards heard you.

65
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:12,898
That is against the Iaw, okay?

66
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:17,099
-I'd rather be tried by 12 than carried by 6.
-SoI, pIease advise him.

67
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:20,612
Why don't you give him
some of your expert IegaI advice?

68
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,210
I don't do criminaI Iaw anymore.

69
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:25,250
-No?
-Yeah.

70
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:28,010
Let's get the fuck outta here.

71
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,884
-It's stiII here!
-GIad I'm not.

72
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:38,486
Can't imagine anything worse
than stiII Iiving here.

73
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:41,726
Try being in a state prison
for about 1,000 days.

74
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:46,096
Jess.

75
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:47,504
Yeah?

76
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:50,576
I wanted to ask you
a kinda personaI question.

77
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:54,007
Can I?

78
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,374
You want to ask me?

79
00:06:56,582 --> 00:07:00,780
In prison, how do you keep from getting...

80
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:02,276
...butt-fucked?

81
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:05,949
-Come on, Teddy!
-What? I'm curious.

82
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,986
-You don't, actuaIIy.
-My God.

83
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,827
No. I mean, it's reaIIy not that big a deaI.

84
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,060
I'm serious. I mean, I was Iike you guys.

85
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:18,763
I thought it was something
I'd never do, but....

86
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:21,900
I Iiked it, you know?

87
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:24,499
There were points
when I was actuaIIy craving it.

88
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:26,440
You know, I was Ionging for it.

89
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,978
There's something naturaI about it.

90
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:35,415
Don't teII me you've never at Ieast
thought about something Iike this.

91
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,278
PIease! No!

92
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,258
To be perfectIy honest,
I've had dreams about it.

93
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:42,717
-Sure.
-Yeah, I've had--

94
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:46,922
I had one. Not a dream, though.
It was actuaI.... Never mind.

95
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:50,628
Just an experience, whatever.
That was before I was with Mary and aII.

96
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:53,161
Confession time?

97
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:58,642
AII right. I was out on maneuvers once,
I was sharing a foxhoIe with this guy...

98
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:00,871
...and he started to come on to me.

99
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:05,247
So, I don't know.... I Iet him bIow me.

100
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:07,813
If you cIose your eyes, it's the same thing.

101
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,285
You don't have to do that.

102
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,887
You guys aII going queer on me?

103
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:14,558
I mean, Teddy, that I couId understand...

104
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,820
...but, come on!

105
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:19,060
You know, SoI,
you don't have to be a queer...

106
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:21,356
...to fuck another man, right?

107
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:26,939
What a sucker.

108
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:30,372
AsshoIes. A coIIection of asshoIes.

109
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:32,977
-To Jesse.
-To Jess.

110
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:34,410
To freedom.

111
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:47,187
This pIace hasn't changed
since high schooI.

112
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:56,398
You sure you want to
go through with this, Jess?

113
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:59,767
I've never been more sure
about anything in my Iife.

114
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:06,775
Teddy, I need to get some cash.
Drop me off at the next corner.

115
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,045
Can it wait?

116
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:11,244
What's the big deaI?

117
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,452
Hope is the big deaI. She'II kiII me.

118
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:17,114
I forgot your wedding present, aII right?

119
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,622
Cash. How touching.

120
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,385
It's two bIocks from the church.

121
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,791
I can make it there
in Iess than three minutes.

122
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,090
-Drop me off, Teddy.
-Yeah. Okay.

123
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,727
PuII over for you, okey-dokes.

124
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:38,573
-Don't be Iate, okay?
-Trust me.

125
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,184
Go on. After you.

126
00:09:57,396 --> 00:09:58,727
Okay.

127
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:00,526
-PuII over.
-Why?

128
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,958
I don't trust him.

129
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:05,526
Let's, just wait here for a sec, okay?
It'II make me feeI better.

130
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:07,969
TeII you what. I'II go check it out.

131
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:10,065
You guys just sit tight.

132
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:16,142
-TeII him to hurry up, pIease.
-Yeah. Roger that.

133
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,710
Now we've Iost two.

134
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,275
So, how's Mary?

135
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,888
She hates me.

136
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:31,324
-Come on.
-I just want to make sure he has one.

137
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:36,057
You know, maybe it's just a phase,
her hating you.

138
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:42,639
No, she's pretty much hated me
from the day I got her pregnant.

139
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:44,834
Sure it's yours?

140
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:50,948
Am I sure it's mine? Come on.
She was a virgin when I met her.

141
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:52,940
Okay?

142
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:56,944
Good friends....

143
00:10:57,123 --> 00:11:00,115
''How weary, staIe, fIat and unprofitabIe...

144
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:02,353
''...seem to me aII the uses of this worId!''

145
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:04,389
You, sir, down on the fIoor.

146
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,598
And you, ''bid the pIayers make haste.''

147
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,026
Come on, my Iove, get thee to the vauIt!

148
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:11,601
We must hurry! Let's go!

149
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:31,451
-BiIIy?
-It's HamIet.

150
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:35,954
-He's back there.
-He's over there.

151
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:38,923
BiIIy?

152
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:47,166
-Sorry!
-Your kingdom wiII thank you.

153
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:49,969
Let's go!

154
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:59,342
''If you have hitherto conceaI'd this sight,
Iet it be tenabIe in your siIence stiII;

155
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:01,716
''And whatsoever eIse shaII hap to-night...

''So, fare you weII.''

159
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:17,260
Freeze!

160
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:21,768
Drop the gun!
Drop the fucking gun or I wiII drop you!

161
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:23,705
Goddamn it, Buzz!

162
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,211
-What the fuck are you doing?
-What the fuck does it Iook Iike I'm doing?

163
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:35,044
WiII you go in and get those asshoIes
before they ruin my wedding day?

164
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:37,213
-Who?
-Buzz.

165
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,717
-Go get them.
-And BiIIy. Both!

166
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:43,818
You want me to go get them?

167
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:47,227
-HoId it! HoId it!
-Jesus.

168
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:51,397
Don't be a hero, buddy.
Just hand over the gun.

169
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,309
Come on, guys, we gotta--

170
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:01,870
What the heII are you doing?

171
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:05,380
-What's going on here?
-Ask BiIIy.

172
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:06,846
HoIy shit!

173
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,284
-Grab him!
-Get out of the way!

174
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,923
Goddamn it, Teddy!

175
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:14,554
PIease, nobody move.

176
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:17,919
-Okay, what shouId we do?
-I don't know.

177
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,793
I know what I'm doing.

178
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:21,628
-What?
-Shit.

179
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:25,103
You gotta be kidding me.
You gotta fucking be kidding me!

180
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:27,968
-What are you guys thinking?
-ObviousIy we're not, Jess.

181
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,165
No, sorry. I'm getting married today...

182
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:32,608
...so you guys can just
handIe this on your own.

183
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:34,201
SmiIe on your way out.

184
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,281
Say ''cheese.''

185
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:40,348
HoIy fuck!

186
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:45,480
-Get the tape. BiIIy, go get the tape!
-Come on, BiIIy, move your ass!

187
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:48,389
-Where is it?
-Where is it usuaIIy?

188
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:50,092
Excuse me.

189
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:53,621
The tape deck is in the manager's office...

190
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:57,133
...behind the picture of RonaId Reagan.

191
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:03,768
-Come on, BiIIy, get it! Move it!
-How couId you guys do this today, Buzz?

192
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:05,844
-Wasn't my idea.
-Jesse?

193
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,372
HoId on!

194
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:10,672
AII you had to do
was get me from jaiI to the chapeI.

195
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:13,149
-Jess!
-Just a second, Teddy.

196
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:16,517
I don't think that tape's
gonna matter much anymore.

197
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:20,653
And I don't think we're gonna
make it to your wedding.

198
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,457
What have we got here, Cuervo?

199
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:28,022
Four, possibIy five men, armed, in tuxedos.

200
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:30,293
What?

201
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,402
Bud!

202
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,270
-Any casuaIties?
-None that we know of.

203
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:43,242
Where's your button?

204
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:48,644
Must've faIIen off.

205
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:55,524
Hostages?

206
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:58,962
Tough to say. 5 to 10 empIoyees...

207
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:01,589
...couId be as many as
15 customers in there.

208
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:04,966
This is not a good time for this.

209
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:06,805
Is that it?

210
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:11,376
Not quite. We got a witness
who says one of 'em was taIking funny.

211
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,008
What do you mean?

212
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,272
Sounded Iike Shakespeare.

213
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:21,719
Sir, I think it's HamIet.

214
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:28,020
Contact the evening news
and the Daily lndependence...

215
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,323
...and send it out over the wire.
I want this on CNN.

216
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,455
This is a good time for this.

217
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:36,864
-Anything eIse?
-Yeah. Stay on your toes.

218
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:40,336
This HamIet guy knows what he's doing.
He's a professionaI.

219
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:41,336
''Trust me''?

220
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,705
I'm a free man, you son of a bitch!
Is this my wedding present?

221
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,210
-I oughta kiII you!
-Just reIax, Jess, aII right?

222
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:49,076
Do you know what you've done here?

223
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:50,648
Do you have any idea at aII?

224
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:52,842
You weren't even supposed
to come in here.

225
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,785
If you'd gone to the church,
none of this wouId've happened!

226
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:58,755
-That's a moot point now, BiIIy.
-It's a what?

227
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,394
-It doesn't matter anymore. It's too Iate!
-Moot.

228
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:06,131
Then go, Jess. Go! Get outta here!

229
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:08,426
SoI, you care to expIain to Butch Cassidy...

230
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:10,365
...how things actuaIIy work?

231
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:14,269
-I toId you, I don't do criminaI Iaw.
-Just induIge us, okay?

232
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:18,771
-TeII him!
-Okay. AII right. Outside of the obvious...

233
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:22,278
...what, armed robbery,
kidnapping, we have accompIice IiabiIity...

234
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:24,645
...and probabIy conspiracy
to commit a feIony.

235
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:28,117
-What are you taIking about?
-We are aiding and abetting as we speak.

236
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,711
Do you understand that? No.

237
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:34,757
Look, Jess, I'II take care of this, aII right?

238
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:37,551
I'II handIe it.

239
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:44,958
HandIe it.

240
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:51,233
This is Sheriff Bud PhiIIips
of the Sheriff's department.

241
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:55,643
You are compIeteIy surrounded.
I want to speak to the person in charge.

242
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:58,811
You got a name, son?

243
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:02,212
BiIIy?

244
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:04,416
Hi, dad.

245
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:06,315
You stiII there?

246
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:09,588
You get your worthIess ass
out of that bank right now, you hear me?

247
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:13,931
-So, how you been, dad?
-Don't you beIittIe me, you piece of shit!

248
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,227
I see you're stiII...

249
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:17,962
...the same gentIe, Ioving
father that you aIways were.

250
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:22,069
I'II teII you what, you ingrate!
Get out of there in five minutes, or I'II--

251
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:24,608
You'II what?
Let me expIain something to you, dad!

252
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,837
I am in charge here!
I am caIIing the shots!

253
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:31,006
You hear me? And l will dictate
who does what and whenl

254
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,551
I'II caII you back with my demands.

255
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:35,949
And, dad, fuck you!

256
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:41,448
-That heIped.
-Good negotiating skiIIs, BiIIy.

257
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:45,554
-Maybe it's true.
-Maybe the Cubs'II win.

258
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:47,029
Let me teII you something.

259
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:50,067
That HamIet guy's on
the FBI's most wanted Iist.

260
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:52,970
BiIIy's never been wanted by anyone.

261
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:55,970
Sheriff, the press is here.

262
00:17:57,342 --> 00:17:58,866
Where can I find the sheriff?

263
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,470
-He's in there, ma'am.
-Shit.

264
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:04,910
Why don't you caII your dad back?
He'II probabIy Iisten.

265
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:07,315
-Fuck him.
-May I make a suggestion?

266
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,284
Yeah. By aII means, pIease.

267
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:14,655
You might want to reIease
the two eIderIy Iadies...

268
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,819
...as a gesture of good faith.

269
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:20,591
Speak for yourseIf.

270
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,162
Jesse ReiIIy?

271
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,563
Hi, Mrs. Johnson.

272
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:29,732
I thought you were getting married today.

273
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:32,877
Yeah. I was supposed to.

274
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:35,511
Excuse me...

275
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:40,251
...if these fine citizens wish to stay,
and you're in the reIeasing phase...

276
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:43,549
...perhaps you might reIease me.

277
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:45,353
That's the mayor.

278
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:48,186
This is great, BiIIy.

279
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:51,126
-You've kidnapped a pubIic officiaI.
-Shit!

280
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:55,696
Look, everybody just sit tight, aII right?
Nobody's going anywhere.

281
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,497
Don't have to. They're coming to us.

282
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,569
Can you get back on the sidewaIk?

283
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:07,202
My no-good son's not pIaying me
Iike a puppet in front of these voters.

284
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:09,974
BiIIy, get your ass out here!

285
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:15,312
You're so sure you're a man, why don't
you come out and taIk to me Iike one?

286
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,547
Let's move cIoser. Right there.

287
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:19,722
Can't we get any cIoser?

288
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,225
That about says it aII.

289
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:32,064
-Get them outta here.
-AII right, now, move it back.

290
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:35,137
-Come on.
-BiIIy.

291
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:40,178
BiIIy.

292
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:41,672
Cuervo.

293
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:44,109
-BiIIy.
-Stay cIose on BiIIy.

294
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:47,515
-How are things?
-You know, just same oId, same oId.

295
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,887
Yeah.

296
00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:52,089
-How's the famiIy?
-Good. Growing up fast.

297
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:56,790
Jimmy's pIaying soccer now.
He says he wants to pIay in the WorId Cup.

298
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:59,624
Just Iet me know when you
two women are done gossiping.

299
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:05,567
WeII...

300
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:10,098
...wouIdn't your mother be proud of you?

301
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,507
Look at me when I'm taIking to you.

302
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,577
Who's in there with you?

303
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,407
The usuaI misfits?

304
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:18,911
They had nothing to do with this.

305
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:20,541
I'II be the judge of that.

306
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:22,977
This is between you and me.

307
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:26,083
Why don't you just Iet them go?

308
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:28,386
You've been off in La-La-Land too Iong.

309
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:32,156
You need a reaIity check, boy,
and the reaIity is, I'm in charge!

310
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:34,255
I aIways have been and aIways wiII be.

311
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:36,129
Charade's over. You come with me.

312
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,226
I don't think so, aII right?

313
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,873
What are you gonna do,
shoot your oId man?

314
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:48,937
You can't even shoot a rabbit.

315
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:50,975
I Iike rabbits.

316
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,512
You son of a bitch!

317
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:56,748
Gun! On the ground!

318
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:02,090
Christ!

319
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:08,726
Stop firing! HoId your fire!

320
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:23,013
Teddy, get back inside!

321
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:39,256
Sir, shouId we storm the bank?

322
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:47,431
-Fucking--
-We're in it now. You know that, right?

323
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:49,336
-We're in it.
-Teddy.

324
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:52,940
-What? No.
-Cover the back.

325
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:56,139
-Yeah. I'II cover the back.
-SoI, you watch the front.

326
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:59,110
No way. No fuckin' way.

327
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:03,246
Attempted murder is as far as I go.
I'm not participating in this anymore.

328
00:22:03,355 --> 00:22:04,322
You hear this?

329
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:07,392
I'm not invoIved in this anymore, okay?

330
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:10,351
From now on, you consider me a hostage.

331
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:12,488
I'II cover it.

332
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:17,234
You aII right?

333
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:18,503
Yeah.

334
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:21,672
AII right. PuII yourseIf together.

335
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,206
I'II hoId down the fort.

336
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:28,236
Thanks.

337
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,315
Yeah.

338
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:35,478
And much to the horror
of the crowd and this reporter...

339
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:38,623
...sheriff and insurgent
mayoral candidate Bud Phillips...

340
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:40,985
...has ruthlessly ordered his men...

341
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:44,128
...to open fire on his very own son.

342
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:47,123
Billy is believed to be none
other than Hamlet...

343
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:51,964
...who has further frustrated investigators
by leaving behind an unusual calling card:

344
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:55,102
...sizable donations to local orphanages.

345
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:59,135
This mockery has landed him
on the FBl's most-wanted list...

346
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:02,736
...and has some calling him
a modern-day Robin Hood.

347
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,846
The standoff continues.

348
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:10,378
This is Cindy Vargas reporting live
from Memorial State Bank downtown.

349
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:44,279
I'm thinking you shouId probabIy
show me how to use this.

350
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:45,720
-Teddy.
-What?

351
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:47,724
-It's not a toy.
-Yeah.

352
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:53,363
Buzz, I was out there with you, okay?
I was right there with you.

353
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:02,138
You know, it's reaI easy
for you to be a man...

354
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,272
...but I....

355
00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:09,770
This is a moment for me.

356
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:13,506
Okay.

357
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,054
-You got seven in the cIip.
-Check.

358
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:23,184
-One in the chamber.
-Eight.

359
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:25,120
Got it.

360
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,830
Snap the cIip in, puII it back...

361
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:31,666
...Iet it sIide, and you're ready to go.

362
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:37,907
This is the cIip reIease.

363
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:41,203
-This is your safety.
-Yeah. Can I? May I?

364
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,678
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

365
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:04,560
-Man. I'm Iiking this. I Iike that.
-It's got a nice feeI, doesn't it?

366
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:06,828
No. I mean this.

367
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,372
Is that bad?

368
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,471
I must've done something
reaIIy fucked up...

369
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:18,345
...in another Iife,
'cause aII I reaIIy ever wanted to do...

370
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:22,011
...was just get married and procreate.

371
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:24,919
He's hated me since the day I was born.

372
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:28,784
Do you ever wanna have kids?

373
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:32,962
What?

374
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:35,823
Kids. You ever think about kids?

375
00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:41,965
No.

376
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,705
I'm not going back.

377
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,317
Look, Jess....

378
00:25:56,521 --> 00:25:58,455
I'II get you out of this.

379
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:00,819
I promise.

380
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:03,588
Sheriff.

381
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:06,554
BiIIy's coming out, and he wants to taIk.

382
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:11,358
-It's about time.
-To Cuervo.

383
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,261
Sir.

384
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:46,571
BiIIy!

385
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:48,596
Let 'em go!

386
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:52,969
You think you couId get us some food
and something to drink?

387
00:26:53,244 --> 00:26:56,543
-That couId be arranged.
-HamIet!

388
00:26:57,349 --> 00:27:01,649
-I went to schooI with that guy.
-You don't have to go through with this.

389
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,286
Yeah, I do.

390
00:27:11,563 --> 00:27:13,394
He's worried about you.

391
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:16,192
You gotta taIk to him, BiIIy.

392
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:19,169
HamIet! HamIet!

393
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:35,748
HamIet!

394
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:43,689
''AngeIs and ministers of grace defend us!

''What shouId we do?''

WeII, I'm thinking we shouId
ask for poIiticaI asyIum in...

412
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,597
...Argentina.

413
00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:00,231
What? What do you guys think?

414
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:02,037
I think you're a schmuck.

415
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:05,109
You shouId turn yourseIves in
before somebody gets kiIIed.

416
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:07,804
First time offenders.
You're Iooking at three to five.

417
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,937
-Months?
-Years.

418
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:13,309
If someone dies, then you're Iooking at Iife.

419
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,648
Except me.
I'm Iooking at Iife no matter what.

420
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,947
Three strikes and you're out, right, SoI?

421
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:20,589
Three to five years, what the heII?

422
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:23,126
I've been in my own IittIe prison
for the Iast 10.

423
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:24,422
It's caIIed marriage.

424
00:29:24,629 --> 00:29:28,463
-No, it doesn't end Iike this.
-So we need a pIan.

425
00:29:29,734 --> 00:29:31,258
What if we asked for a pIane?

426
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,670
FIy to Mexico. They don't extradite.

427
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:35,940
BiIIy, we're in Independence.

428
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:38,609
What are we gonna fIy out in,
a crop duster?

429
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:39,904
What about a bus?

430
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:42,980
We couId take it to BakersfieId
and try fIying out from there.

431
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:45,572
Dog Day Afternoon.
They take you out at the airport.

432
00:29:45,683 --> 00:29:48,709
-I haven't seen it.
-You got any bright ideas?

433
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:53,123
-You heard me, I'm not invoIved in this.
-Okay, then shut the fuck up.

434
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,354
You couId get a heIicopter...

435
00:29:56,828 --> 00:30:00,594
...Iand it on the roof,
access it through the air ducts...

436
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:02,893
...without even going outside.

437
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:06,035
ReaIIy? And who's gonna fIy it?

438
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:08,005
I wiII.

439
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:09,570
Who is this guy?

440
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:11,605
I guess...

441
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:15,338
...I'm what most peopIe
commonIy refer to...

442
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:18,176
...as the disgruntIed Vietnam vet.

443
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:22,580
I suffer from post-traumatic
stress disorder...

444
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,581
...occasionaI bouts of maIaria...

445
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:28,651
...fIashbacks, nightmares.

446
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:33,157
I got a steeI pIate in my ass, I wet the bed.

447
00:30:34,632 --> 00:30:38,363
I'm convinced that my body
is being consumed by cancer...

448
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:41,870
...which might expIain
my suicidaI tendencies, but...

449
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:48,436
...I can fIy the heII out of a Huey.

450
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:53,342
Lt. John G. CoIeman...

451
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:58,046
...at your disposaI.

452
00:31:00,892 --> 00:31:02,416
''Gonzo'' CoIeman?

453
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:04,861
Where'd you hear that name?

454
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:08,026
HoIy shit! You gotta be kidding me.

455
00:31:08,132 --> 00:31:09,429
This guy is a Iegend.

456
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:11,634
Vietnam. '68 to '70.

457
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:15,334
He fIew over 300 missions
in those two years.

458
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:19,440
23 choppers shot out
from underneath him, 52 Air MedaIs...

459
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:22,604
...12 SiIver Stars, five PurpIe Hearts...

460
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:24,972
...and the CongressionaI MedaI of Honor.

461
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:28,675
And you forgot to mention
dishonorabIy discharged.

462
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:31,178
ActuaIIy, it was Section 8.

463
00:31:31,756 --> 00:31:35,419
Sgt. Buzz Thomas,
US Army SpeciaI Forces.

464
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:36,953
It's a priviIege.

465
00:31:37,962 --> 00:31:40,522
No shit? Green Beret?

466
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:44,192
So what are you doing out of uniform?

467
00:31:44,802 --> 00:31:46,895
AIso dishonorabIy discharged.

468
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:50,569
-Buzz?
-It's a Iong story.

469
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:53,267
How do you know so much
about this bank?

470
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:56,279
I've been casing this pIace for months.

471
00:31:56,648 --> 00:32:01,483
I was gonna rob it myseIf,
except that your buddy over here...

472
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:03,677
...got through the door first.

473
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:08,656
Life: It's just a series of coincidences.

474
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:11,792
Or a comedy of errors.

475
00:32:13,898 --> 00:32:15,160
They want a chopper.

476
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,196
For Christ's sakes.

477
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:19,134
Sir.

478
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:22,937
BakersfieId PD wants to know
if they can get in on the action.

479
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:24,975
I guess it's a IittIe sIow over there.

480
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:27,169
TeII them to mind their goddamn business.

481
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:29,540
What do you want me to teII him?

482
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:33,484
Don't teII him anything.

483
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,712
I've got some thinking to do.

484
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:43,688
Sir, I think you better take a Iook at this.

485
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:47,092
Jesse, I think you better
take a Iook at this.

486
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,397
Let go of me!

487
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:53,133
-Let me go!
-We can't Iet you in there.

488
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:55,267
Leave her aIone!

489
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:57,638
Let me go!

490
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:09,310
Teddy! Teddy!

491
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,053
Teddy PoIIack!

492
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:25,767
Get in here!

493
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,432
Buzz, did you see?

494
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:30,267
BiIIy? Did anybody see that?
Were you watching?

495
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:31,636
You hear them?

496
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:34,109
Listen. That's me. I'm Teddy.

497
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:37,807
My God. I'm a fuckin' hero.
I hope my wife is watching this.

498
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:52,160
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

499
00:33:52,263 --> 00:33:54,993
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, sweetheart, I'm okay.

500
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,325
ReaIIy?

501
00:33:59,003 --> 00:34:01,301
Three fucking years!

502
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:05,305
I feeI Iike such a fooI.

503
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:06,973
Ain't Iove grand?

504
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:09,475
This is our wedding day.

505
00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:13,115
-We're supposed to be together.
-Hope....

506
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:16,751
I am so disappointed in you!

507
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:22,190
Honey...

508
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:24,188
...I'm sorry.

509
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:30,634
Sheriff...

510
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:33,067
...is the bride some sort
of accompIice in this?

511
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:34,638
No comment.

512
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:37,274
Does HamIet's mother have
anything to do with this?

513
00:34:37,442 --> 00:34:40,878
-No comment.
-Sheriff PhiIIips, do you Iove your son?

514
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,239
-Come on, Iet's go.
-Sheriff PhiIIips?

515
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:45,982
How can this get any worse?

516
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:53,954
Sheriff, the FBI just puIIed up.

517
00:34:57,528 --> 00:34:59,052
Just stay back.

518
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,128
Who's in charge of this circus?

519
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:06,928
I am.

520
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:11,272
-Chief Bud PhiIIips.
-I'm Agent Hoover. No reIation.

521
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,674
-This is Agent Carter.
-Coffee?

522
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:16,937
Caffeine makes me edgy.

523
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,744
So what's the poop?

524
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:27,124
The poop is we've got
five armed men in tuxedoes...

525
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:28,586
...and 11 hostages.

526
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,822
HamIet works aIone.

527
00:35:31,162 --> 00:35:33,824
Seems Iike he picked up
some merry men aIong the way.

528
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:35,990
AbIe to ID any of them?

529
00:35:37,935 --> 00:35:39,095
Three so far.

530
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:44,639
Buzz Thomas, Teddy PoIIack,
and BiIIy PhiIIips.

531
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:46,538
PhiIIips?

532
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:49,712
-Any reIation?
-Perhaps an inbred cousin?

533
00:35:51,415 --> 00:35:52,575
He's my son.

534
00:35:55,753 --> 00:35:57,243
So what are they demanding?

535
00:35:57,355 --> 00:35:58,754
More aIIowance?

536
00:35:59,123 --> 00:36:01,353
-They want a chopper.
-So give it to 'em.

537
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:03,821
-On whose authority?
-Mine.

538
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:06,989
ReIax. Big Brother's here.

539
00:36:09,033 --> 00:36:11,661
You Iisten to me, you Ivy-League pricks.

540
00:36:12,036 --> 00:36:14,163
This is my town,
and that's my son in there.

541
00:36:14,272 --> 00:36:16,263
No, you Iisten to me, daddy.

542
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:19,806
This is officiaIIy under my jurisdiction,
and any time I want...

543
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:22,345
...I can and wiII take over this operation.

544
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,213
Make no mistake...

545
00:36:24,615 --> 00:36:26,981
...this isn't Much Ado About Nothing.

546
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:29,152
I want HamIet.

547
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:39,963
Jerry and I, God rest his souI,
used to fight just Iike you two.

548
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:42,332
One morning we were going at it....

549
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:45,067
Funny, I can't even remember
what it was about...

550
00:36:45,169 --> 00:36:46,898
...but I wasn't gonna give in.

551
00:36:47,004 --> 00:36:49,768
Neither was he. So I toId him....

552
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,671
''I have nothing more to say to you.

553
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:53,368
''You just get on out of here.''

554
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:57,004
How sad. Did he Ieave you?

555
00:36:57,615 --> 00:37:00,448
He stormed out the door,
and he was so busy cussing me out...

556
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:03,042
...that he waIked right in front
of a Greyhound bus.

557
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:05,284
SpIattered him aII over my azaIeas.

558
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:10,090
Do you Iove him, honey?

559
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:13,391
More than anything.

560
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:16,395
More than anything in the worId.

561
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:18,665
Then don't waste time.

562
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,561
You never know how much you got Ieft.

563
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:29,806
Honey? Hi.

564
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:31,940
Are you watching?

565
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:36,611
Yeah.

566
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:41,419
No, you don't understand.
You don't.... Why?

567
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,128
I know, but why shouId I?

568
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:48,559
Because you say so?

569
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:53,235
ActuaIIy, I've got a IittIe news for you...

570
00:37:54,171 --> 00:37:55,229
...baby.

571
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:59,174
The days of you ''saying so''...

572
00:37:59,377 --> 00:38:02,278
...are over, okay?
I'm not turning myseIf in.

573
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:05,206
I'm sorry. What?

574
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:08,851
What has gotten into me? Okay.

575
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:13,781
Yeah, what has gotten into me?
Maybe something caIIed Iife. Life!

576
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:15,286
No, you Iisten!

577
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:19,295
For the first time
in my miserabIe, mundane...

578
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:23,398
...candy-assed fucking existence...

579
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:26,334
...I'm having a IittIe bit of fun...

580
00:38:26,537 --> 00:38:28,937
...and you're not gonna
fucking spoiI it, get it?

581
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,531
Got it? Fucking good!

582
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:40,110
-How's it going?
-The same.

583
00:38:42,753 --> 00:38:44,914
So, I take it they found out.

584
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:46,688
What?

585
00:38:46,957 --> 00:38:48,424
You know what I mean.

586
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:52,286
Be aII you can be, but don't be queer.

587
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:55,491
What are you taIking about?

588
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:58,829
I'm taIking about your gender preference.

589
00:38:59,704 --> 00:39:02,673
I think one of those buIIets
must have bounced off your head.

590
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:05,867
Yeah? Look me in the eye,
and teII me I'm wrong.

591
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:08,539
You're fuII of shit.

592
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:09,871
Am I?

593
00:39:10,614 --> 00:39:13,549
''This above aII,'' Buzz.
''To thine own seIf be true...

594
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:15,949
''...and it must foIIow,
as the night the day...

595
00:39:16,053 --> 00:39:18,385
''...thou canst not then
be faIse to any man.''

596
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:22,652
I don't understand a word you just said.

597
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:46,009
Decaf, right?

598
00:39:51,288 --> 00:39:53,051
You ever have one of those days...

599
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:56,058
...where you just wanna
mow down the whoIe fucking crowd?

600
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,149
No.

601
00:39:57,862 --> 00:39:59,887
You're young. Give it time.

602
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:05,263
Where are the snipers I ordered?

603
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:07,098
ATF wiII be here within the hour.

604
00:40:07,204 --> 00:40:09,195
-Chopper?
-Gassed and ready.

605
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:13,767
I want you to position the shooters
on the roof of that bank...

606
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:16,438
...and on the buiIding across the street.

607
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:20,615
We'II bring the chopper in at daybreak,
and set it down over there.

608
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:23,885
When they move,
the sun wiII be in their eyes...

609
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:26,047
...and we'II have them in a crossfire.

610
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:28,717
No one wiII know who did the shooting.

611
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:31,159
What about the hostages?

612
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:36,565
It's a tragedy, Carter.

613
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:43,266
God!

614
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,875
God, I used to get off on it, man.

615
00:40:47,244 --> 00:40:49,212
The adrenaIine rush.

616
00:40:49,346 --> 00:40:53,043
Mission after mission,
I couId not get enough.

617
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:56,752
And then one day...

618
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:00,279
...I dropped my first hit of acid...

619
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:03,352
...and it aII came cIear.

620
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:06,791
I took a good Iook at what we were doing.

621
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:11,124
I said it was wrong, so I grounded myseIf.

622
00:41:12,102 --> 00:41:15,094
And the onIy reason
that I am not in Leavenworth...

623
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:17,970
...is because it wouId have been
somewhat embarrassing...

624
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:21,634
...for the army to admit
their most ceIebrated copter jockey...

625
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:23,940
...suddenIy deveIoped a moraI conscience.

626
00:41:27,585 --> 00:41:30,383
So they gave me Section 8
and sent me home.

627
00:41:32,389 --> 00:41:34,323
So what's your sad story?

628
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:37,592
I...

629
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:40,226
...wasn't exactIy in accordance...

630
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:43,562
...with standard miIitary procedures.

631
00:41:43,868 --> 00:41:45,165
A rebeI?

632
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,661
I guess you couId say that.

633
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:54,439
I was deemed inappropriate
for this man's army.

634
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:11,519
AII I ever wanted to be was a soIdier...

635
00:42:12,897 --> 00:42:14,626
...to serve my country...

636
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:17,562
...to wear that uniform.

637
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:23,931
And they took aII that away from me.

638
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:30,346
Let me teII you something, Sergeant.

639
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:34,074
A uniform does not make a soIdier.

640
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:38,188
A soIdier is someone
who is wiIIing to stand up...

641
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:42,453
...and fight for what he beIieves in,
be it his God...

642
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:46,454
...his country, or his friends.

643
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:51,030
And it does not matter
if you are bIack, white...

644
00:42:51,135 --> 00:42:55,469
...red, yeIIow, maIe, femaIe...

645
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:58,573
...straight, or gay.

646
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:01,473
We aII bIeed the same.

647
00:43:17,127 --> 00:43:21,461
I was sure that I had run down
every singIe possibIe scenario...

648
00:43:21,565 --> 00:43:25,797
...of what couId have gone wrong today,
but this one wins the prize.

649
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:27,894
Hope, you have to beIieve me.

650
00:43:28,038 --> 00:43:31,439
I didn't know what was gonna go on
when I waIked in the door.

651
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:34,841
I know that.
It doesn't make it any easier, but I know.

652
00:43:35,512 --> 00:43:38,345
You stiII, you shouIdn't have come in here.

653
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:42,143
What was I supposed to do?
Wait at the aItar?

654
00:43:42,252 --> 00:43:45,779
Catch you on teIevision?
Wait to find out if you were....

655
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:51,458
I Iove you.

656
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:54,027
I had to come.

657
00:43:56,767 --> 00:43:59,736
But you don't have to stay here. You can't.

658
00:44:00,404 --> 00:44:03,066
You know,
screwing up my Iife is one thing...

659
00:44:03,173 --> 00:44:05,903
...but I'm reaIIy tired of screwing up yours.

660
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:08,911
You need to move on to something better.

661
00:44:10,214 --> 00:44:11,841
To someone better.

662
00:44:14,785 --> 00:44:15,945
Hope....

663
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:21,885
I'm Ietting you go.

664
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:30,700
ReaIIy?

665
00:44:31,035 --> 00:44:32,195
Yeah.

666
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:36,939
That is so...

667
00:44:37,274 --> 00:44:38,206
...maIe!

668
00:44:40,577 --> 00:44:41,908
''I'm Ietting you go.''

669
00:44:43,747 --> 00:44:47,547
If I couId've Iet you go,
I wouId've Iet you go a Iong time ago.

670
00:44:48,819 --> 00:44:50,912
Let's get something straight.

671
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:53,854
I'm not going anywhere.

672
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:56,390
''TiII death do us part''...

673
00:44:56,493 --> 00:44:59,257
...and I think that you shouId
just drop the macho shit.

674
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:04,495
If that's reaIIy the way you feeI,
then I don't think...

675
00:45:04,601 --> 00:45:07,001
...that you Ieave me any other choice.

676
00:45:09,506 --> 00:45:13,374
-How many birds you got avaiIabIe?
-They want a priest.

677
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:17,446
-Christ! Is somebody dead?
-No. Somebody wants to get married.

678
00:45:18,148 --> 00:45:20,639
-AbsoIuteIy not.
-Give it to them.

679
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:22,685
-What?
-You heard the man.

680
00:45:22,786 --> 00:45:25,118
-He said, ''Give it to them.''
-And I said no.

681
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:27,247
I'd be the Iaughingstock of the country.

682
00:45:27,357 --> 00:45:29,348
-Are you chaIIenging me?
-I just think--

683
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:32,361
I don't give a shit
what you think, John Boy.

684
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:35,393
Go set it up, Carter.

685
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:41,795
-No, it's no probIem.
-SoI.

686
00:45:42,606 --> 00:45:44,870
-CouId I meet you in there?
-Sure.

687
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:49,409
I know what you're gonna say.
What a seIfish IittIe bastard I am.

688
00:45:49,513 --> 00:45:51,572
OnIy Iooking out for my own skin.

689
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:55,750
I don't care about anyone
or anything but myseIf, right?

690
00:45:56,186 --> 00:45:59,644
ActuaIIy, I was gonna ask you
to stand up with Jesse...

691
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,816
...instead of standing with the hostages.

692
00:46:02,192 --> 00:46:05,252
Come on, Hope.
He didn't even invite me. You did.

693
00:46:05,729 --> 00:46:09,392
Yes, and you didn't steaI the ring. He did.

694
00:46:12,503 --> 00:46:15,165
You can't keep bIaming yourseIf
for his mistakes.

695
00:46:16,073 --> 00:46:18,303
No, but I can for mine.

696
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:22,474
Look, I'm the one who refused
to pIea bargain...

697
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:25,377
...I'm the one who took it to triaI,
I'm the one who Iost.

698
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,107
What pIea bargain?

699
00:46:28,819 --> 00:46:32,380
That's right.
I didn't teII him. Do you get the picture?

700
00:46:32,523 --> 00:46:35,822
I wanted to go to triaI and prove myseIf,
so I didn't teII him.

701
00:46:36,827 --> 00:46:38,818
I didn't teII anybody.

702
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,866
Jesus, Hope, I took his Iife away.

703
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:48,968
I took your Iife away.

704
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:54,668
So...

705
00:46:55,412 --> 00:46:57,573
...how you feeI about me now?

706
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:08,986
Like forgiving you.

707
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:20,827
Who gives this bride away?

708
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:25,474
I wiII. Jerome WiIIie Mays Johnson.

709
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:28,975
My dad was a Giants fan.

710
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,377
Thank you.

711
00:47:32,816 --> 00:47:35,717
GentIemen, we are gathered
in the house of the Lord.

712
00:47:35,819 --> 00:47:39,118
It's not appropriate to be brandishing
weaponry during the ceremony.

713
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:40,850
We're in a bank.

714
00:47:41,158 --> 00:47:42,989
We're in the presence of the Lord...

715
00:47:43,093 --> 00:47:46,062
...we'II be reciting the words
of Jesus Christ, our Savior...

716
00:47:46,163 --> 00:47:47,630
...and they make me nervous.

717
00:47:57,774 --> 00:47:59,742
In circumstances such as these...

718
00:47:59,843 --> 00:48:02,209
...I Iike to start by reading
from the Scriptures.

719
00:48:02,512 --> 00:48:03,877
Let us pray.

720
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:06,942
''As the apostIes gathered around him...

721
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:09,678
''...Jesus Iooked upon them
with great sorrow...

722
00:48:10,153 --> 00:48:13,281
''...for he knew that one of them
wouId betray him.

723
00:48:28,472 --> 00:48:31,839
''He stood before them
as both judge and jury.

724
00:48:33,877 --> 00:48:36,846
''And with a heart fuII of forgiveness,
said....''

725
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:39,007
Freeze!

726
00:48:57,334 --> 00:48:58,562
Medic!

727
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:08,901
Do it, I swear to God, I'II kiII you.

728
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:13,075
You wouIdn't shoot a man of the cIoth,
wouId you?

729
00:49:13,984 --> 00:49:15,315
I'm Jewish.

730
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:20,388
-Who the heII fired those shots?
-ReIax, pops.

731
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:24,449
-We just eIiminated the probIem for you.
-The priest was one of ours.

732
00:49:25,395 --> 00:49:28,421
This hurts. It fucking hurts!

733
00:49:29,166 --> 00:49:32,329
Got yourseIf a miIIion-doIIar
wound here, soIdier.

734
00:49:33,003 --> 00:49:35,904
-You're going stateside.
-It hurts!

735
00:49:36,006 --> 00:49:40,136
-Hang in there. You're gonna make it.
-No. Take me out, BiIIy. Just take me out.

736
00:49:40,243 --> 00:49:42,336
I'm a wounded horse.
I can't race anymore.

737
00:49:44,514 --> 00:49:47,074
You'II never get out of here aIive,
Mr. Green Beret.

738
00:49:47,184 --> 00:49:50,415
Or shouId I say Pink Beret?
We know aII about you.

739
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,647
You know what they do to boys Iike you....

740
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:57,691
-It hurts!
-Come on. Hang in there, Teddy.

741
00:49:57,794 --> 00:50:00,695
-You're gonna be okay. I promise.
-We gotta get him out.

742
00:50:00,797 --> 00:50:03,630
No, I'm not going out.
You know what? ActuaIIy, I am fine.

743
00:50:03,734 --> 00:50:05,224
I am fine. I feeI fine.

744
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:08,395
Teddy, if you don't go, you're gonna die.

745
00:50:08,872 --> 00:50:11,636
Buzz, I'm not gonna give myseIf up.
I'm not a coward.

746
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:13,536
Now, you Iisten to me!

747
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:16,042
I've seen peopIe die.

748
00:50:17,247 --> 00:50:22,014
And the one thing I've Iearned is,
it takes a heII of a Iot more courage to Iive.

749
00:50:24,955 --> 00:50:26,388
That's it. Sing.

750
00:50:30,093 --> 00:50:32,288
That's it. Just keep singing.

751
00:50:42,572 --> 00:50:43,937
Stand back!

752
00:50:51,281 --> 00:50:53,579
-Put your foot down.
-Yeah. No.

753
00:50:54,084 --> 00:50:56,746
You know what? I'II do it. I'II take it.

754
00:50:57,387 --> 00:50:59,287
-I'm okay.
-You sure?

755
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:01,619
Yeah, I'm gonna take it.

756
00:51:08,098 --> 00:51:10,157
Just take IittIe baby steps.

757
00:51:10,434 --> 00:51:13,232
I'm not a coward, see? I'm not a coward.

758
00:51:14,137 --> 00:51:16,571
-Are you roIIing?
-Okay.

759
00:51:17,307 --> 00:51:18,274
Move!

760
00:51:19,276 --> 00:51:20,436
I got him.

761
00:51:22,112 --> 00:51:24,410
-Strap him.
-Standing by.

762
00:51:25,816 --> 00:51:26,783
Easy does it.

763
00:51:29,352 --> 00:51:33,220
-Teddy, who did this to you?
-I'm Teddy.

764
00:51:33,323 --> 00:51:36,087
-Who's responsibIe for this?
-My name's Teddy.

765
00:51:40,564 --> 00:51:43,556
CongratuIations.
You just created a martyr.

766
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:30,469
Was that your first buddy to go down?

767
00:52:31,248 --> 00:52:35,548
There's gonna be more.
This pIace is crawIing with VC.

768
00:52:38,088 --> 00:52:39,749
We came in Iow, man.

769
00:52:40,123 --> 00:52:43,092
Thirty minutes before dawn,
nap of the earth...

770
00:52:43,193 --> 00:52:45,184
...cracking branches off our skids.

771
00:52:46,263 --> 00:52:49,892
And the LZ was so hot,
it scorched the hair on my baIIs.

772
00:52:54,104 --> 00:52:56,664
You shouId have set up your cIaymores.

773
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:59,305
There's aIways gooks in the wire.

774
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:18,491
Are you okay?

775
00:53:20,797 --> 00:53:21,855
Yeah.

776
00:53:24,601 --> 00:53:26,068
They need you.

777
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:37,407
I don't want to Iose him again.

778
00:53:40,517 --> 00:53:42,815
Teddy Pollack was admitted
to County General...

779
00:53:42,919 --> 00:53:45,820
...and is listed in critical
but stable condition.

780
00:53:45,922 --> 00:53:48,117
I don't know what the fuss is aII about.

781
00:53:48,425 --> 00:53:51,326
Think they'd be used to
shotgun weddings around here.

782
00:53:52,796 --> 00:53:56,232
You think that's funny?
I went to high schooI with him.

783
00:53:57,334 --> 00:53:58,767
How touching.

784
00:53:59,436 --> 00:54:01,495
Share your first sheep, too?

785
00:54:05,308 --> 00:54:08,539
Carter! What are you doing?
Come on! Knock it off!

786
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:16,410
I'm coming out. I want a face-to-face.

787
00:54:16,553 --> 00:54:20,045
Anyone takes a shot at me,
you're the second one to die.

788
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:25,823
AII right, Iisten up!

789
00:54:26,529 --> 00:54:29,157
I am officiaIIy taking over this operation.

790
00:54:29,566 --> 00:54:33,662
Any attempt to interfere
wiII be met with swift, severe punishment.

791
00:54:34,471 --> 00:54:37,235
And if you so much as fart
in my generaI direction...

792
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:39,035
...I'II have you shot.

793
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:08,794
Sit next to me.

794
00:55:14,911 --> 00:55:19,610
Just to remind you,
he's a Green Beret, and he won't miss.

795
00:55:24,354 --> 00:55:25,821
I'm Iistening.

796
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:30,182
-We want a bus.
-I thought you wanted a chopper.

797
00:55:30,293 --> 00:55:33,262
We want it parked out front,
windows tinted, tank fuII of gas.

798
00:55:33,363 --> 00:55:35,456
Just sIow down. You give me something...

799
00:55:35,565 --> 00:55:38,432
...I'II give you something.
That's how it works.

800
00:55:39,302 --> 00:55:41,532
-The priest.
-He's stiII aIive?

801
00:55:41,638 --> 00:55:42,832
Too bad.

802
00:55:43,907 --> 00:55:47,434
FeIony murder gives me a hard-on,
but the night is young.

803
00:55:47,944 --> 00:55:50,504
-One of the hostages.
-Leaves me Iimp.

804
00:55:50,947 --> 00:55:54,144
-Why don't you teII me what you want?
-It's not what I want...

805
00:55:55,552 --> 00:55:57,213
...it's who I want.

806
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:09,092
Do we have a deaI?

807
00:56:11,768 --> 00:56:13,201
I'm stiff as a board.

808
00:56:15,638 --> 00:56:16,866
Charming.

809
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:21,936
Stand up with me. Move to your Ieft.

810
00:56:23,446 --> 00:56:24,504
Stop.

811
00:56:40,697 --> 00:56:43,564
-What do we do now?
-We poison the sword.

812
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:49,330
-He stays.
-And you Iet me hear from you.

813
00:56:50,206 --> 00:56:52,572
I'II try. Thank you so much.

814
00:56:52,675 --> 00:56:53,835
-Good-bye.
-Good-bye.

815
00:56:53,943 --> 00:56:55,706
Thank you for taIking to her.

816
00:56:55,879 --> 00:56:57,642
You be good to yourseIf, you hear?

817
00:56:57,747 --> 00:56:58,941
-You, too.
-Take care.

818
00:56:59,215 --> 00:57:01,683
I've been ordered out of here, Sergeant...

819
00:57:02,152 --> 00:57:04,814
...but I wouId consider it an honor...

820
00:57:05,488 --> 00:57:07,581
...if you were to wear this into battIe.

821
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:10,682
BattIe? HeII, you ain't seen nothin' yet.

822
00:57:13,029 --> 00:57:15,725
Just don't Iet those sons of bitches win.

823
00:57:19,669 --> 00:57:21,660
You're aII gonna die.

824
00:57:44,527 --> 00:57:46,461
Mayor Boar, wiII you make a statement?

825
00:57:46,563 --> 00:57:50,124
I did everything I couId
to keep the situation caIm in there.

826
00:57:52,435 --> 00:57:56,269
-The others are stiII in there.
-Yeah. They were reaIIy nice.

827
00:57:58,141 --> 00:57:59,301
Get back, pIease.

828
00:57:59,709 --> 00:58:01,404
You can count on me!

829
00:58:02,378 --> 00:58:03,970
Right here! One more shot!

830
00:58:04,247 --> 00:58:05,976
Stand back.

831
00:58:07,116 --> 00:58:09,482
Look, we know he's the fifth perp.

832
00:58:12,789 --> 00:58:14,484
You mean, is he in the bank?

833
00:58:14,591 --> 00:58:16,081
-Yeah.
-No.

834
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:17,986
Come on.

835
00:58:18,094 --> 00:58:20,892
He was reIeased this morning,
his wedding was today...

836
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:24,228
...and a woman in a wedding dress
ran into the bank this afternoon.

837
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:26,825
What was she doing, making a deposit?

838
00:58:29,806 --> 00:58:31,034
What about you?

839
00:58:31,274 --> 00:58:32,798
I suppose you don't know him?

840
00:58:32,909 --> 00:58:35,343
No, I know who that is.
That's Jesse ReiIIy.

841
00:58:35,445 --> 00:58:37,538
I've known him since he was in diapers.

842
00:58:37,914 --> 00:58:38,903
Okay.

843
00:58:39,582 --> 00:58:41,243
But he's not in that bank.

844
00:58:42,051 --> 00:58:44,918
This town is reaIIy starting to piss me off.

845
00:58:57,867 --> 00:59:00,267
They grow up fast, don't they, Bud?

846
00:59:02,171 --> 00:59:03,195
Yep.

847
00:59:04,774 --> 00:59:07,538
Before you know it, they're robbing banks.

848
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:16,618
How's that Hamlet story end, anyway?

849
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:27,723
Where do you think you're going?

850
00:59:28,364 --> 00:59:31,629
-I'm gonna go taIk to my son.
-I can't Iet you go in there.

851
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:34,032
You're just gonna have to
shoot me in the back.

852
00:59:38,274 --> 00:59:39,639
BiIIy!

853
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:52,247
HamIet!

854
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:29,619
How can we end this?

855
01:00:32,061 --> 01:00:33,528
What do you want from me?

856
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,031
You reaIIy don't know, do you?

857
01:00:42,572 --> 01:00:44,870
I want you to pIay catch with me.

858
01:00:47,076 --> 01:00:49,670
I want you to heIp me with my homework.

859
01:00:51,114 --> 01:00:55,016
I want you to rouse me out of bed
at 5:00 in the morning and take me fishing.

860
01:00:55,251 --> 01:00:57,879
I want you to have a beer with me
and taIk about girIs.

861
01:00:58,254 --> 01:01:01,314
But, most of aII, I want you to teII me
that it wasn't my fauIt.

862
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:05,225
What wasn't your fauIt?

863
01:01:05,595 --> 01:01:07,028
Come on, dad.

864
01:01:07,864 --> 01:01:10,059
You can't even Iook at me
without seeing her.

865
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:12,896
-Leave her out of this.
-I won't Ieave her out of this.

866
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:15,232
AII we ever did was Ieave her out.

867
01:01:15,772 --> 01:01:17,467
Jesus Christ, you....

868
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:21,401
I don't know a thing about her.

869
01:01:21,778 --> 01:01:23,803
I don't know what kind of woman she was.

870
01:01:24,147 --> 01:01:27,412
I don't know what made her Iaugh,
what made her cry.

871
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:30,218
I don't know what kind
of ice cream she Iiked.

872
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:32,787
I don't even know what
coIor her eyes were.

873
01:01:32,889 --> 01:01:35,380
I don't know a thing about my mother.

874
01:01:37,326 --> 01:01:39,920
Except that you bIame me for her death.

875
01:01:41,731 --> 01:01:43,596
I Iost her, too, dad.

876
01:01:45,935 --> 01:01:47,596
But I didn't kiII her.

877
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:52,466
Green.

878
01:01:55,478 --> 01:01:58,379
She had the most beautifuI
green eyes I'd ever seen.

879
01:02:00,416 --> 01:02:02,247
Green as spring grass.

880
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:08,748
A scoop of Rocky Road
on top of orange sherbet.

881
01:02:13,296 --> 01:02:14,593
I'd Iike to say...

882
01:02:15,298 --> 01:02:17,459
...I did the best I couId, BiIIy...

883
01:02:18,501 --> 01:02:19,593
...but, son...

884
01:02:21,037 --> 01:02:22,629
...I was Iost without her.

885
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:27,168
I brought you up the onIy way I knew how.

886
01:02:36,452 --> 01:02:38,386
Can I ask you something?

887
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:42,021
Why HamIet?

888
01:02:46,162 --> 01:02:48,653
''But yet I do beIieve
the origin and commencement...

889
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:51,290
''...of his grief sprung from negIected Iove.''

890
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:02,669
Because he wanted a father...

891
01:03:03,346 --> 01:03:04,711
...not a ghost.

892
01:03:38,014 --> 01:03:40,847
Hi, Buzz. I just wanted to Iook at this.

893
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:42,281
No.

894
01:03:42,451 --> 01:03:43,816
-But it--
-It's okay.

895
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:46,115
-It's soaked through.
-I know.

896
01:03:48,758 --> 01:03:51,955
I just wanted to thank you
for being such a good friend.

897
01:03:52,261 --> 01:03:53,558
Thank you.

898
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:00,700
What's this?

899
01:04:01,938 --> 01:04:03,098
A gift.

900
01:04:06,876 --> 01:04:08,434
The bus is here.

901
01:04:19,155 --> 01:04:21,851
A bus? I thought that wasn't a good idea.

902
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:25,721
We're not going to BakersfieId.

903
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:31,362
This is Agent Carter.

904
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:33,763
Showtime.

905
01:04:34,570 --> 01:04:35,969
And, boys...

906
01:04:36,505 --> 01:04:39,201
...the most kiIIs gets a trip to DisneyIand.

907
01:05:03,866 --> 01:05:04,833
Shit.

908
01:05:12,341 --> 01:05:14,002
Can't identify the target, sir.

909
01:05:19,348 --> 01:05:21,543
Okay, stay together. Stay together.

910
01:05:22,385 --> 01:05:24,114
You have a green Iight. Take it.

911
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:26,311
Negative, base, it's red.

912
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:29,981
Goddamn it, they are not to reach that bus.

913
01:05:32,995 --> 01:05:34,826
Tight. Keep it tight.

914
01:05:39,201 --> 01:05:40,668
Take the shot.

915
01:05:41,137 --> 01:05:42,866
Target is not cIear.

916
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:48,807
AII right.

917
01:05:56,552 --> 01:05:57,746
What's going on?

918
01:05:58,287 --> 01:05:59,379
Sol Jacobs.

919
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:04,123
You owe me.

920
01:06:05,194 --> 01:06:06,718
What's he taIking about?

921
01:06:07,163 --> 01:06:08,130
SoI?

922
01:06:10,232 --> 01:06:11,961
I had to cut a deaI.

923
01:06:13,302 --> 01:06:15,463
-One of us has to stay.
-What?

924
01:06:15,571 --> 01:06:17,038
What kind of deaI is that?

925
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:19,767
It's the best I couId do
under the circumstances, Buzz.

926
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:21,204
Shit.

927
01:06:23,579 --> 01:06:25,877
-I'II go.
-No, BiIIy. I'm going.

928
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:28,974
-It's me he wants.
-Fuck this! No one is getting off this bus.

929
01:06:29,085 --> 01:06:31,883
This bus isn't moving unIess I get off.
Do you understand?

930
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:33,148
-SoI.
-PIease.

931
01:06:34,290 --> 01:06:36,281
Let me do this for you, okay?

932
01:06:38,427 --> 01:06:39,758
Sol Jacobs.

933
01:06:46,268 --> 01:06:47,963
Don't give up your day job.

934
01:06:49,205 --> 01:06:50,399
I won't.

935
01:07:04,153 --> 01:07:07,281
-You take good care of her, okay?
-I wiII, buddy.

936
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:12,187
Thanks.

937
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:14,326
Come here.

938
01:07:20,503 --> 01:07:22,494
I aIways wanted to do that.

939
01:07:30,813 --> 01:07:32,007
L'Chaim.

940
01:07:33,215 --> 01:07:34,512
Have a margarita on me.

941
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:38,677
Give them heII, CounseIor.

942
01:07:52,468 --> 01:07:54,129
Shit.

943
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:08,080
-Move the cars.
-Give me HamIet.

944
01:08:08,818 --> 01:08:11,616
Change of pIans. You get me instead.

945
01:08:13,456 --> 01:08:14,753
How nobIe.

946
01:08:15,224 --> 01:08:18,057
WiIIing to sacrifice
yourseIf for your friends.

947
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:20,856
What can I say? Friendship runs deep.

948
01:08:20,963 --> 01:08:25,297
-Now, move the goddamn cars.
-I guess I overestimated your inteIIigence.

949
01:08:25,401 --> 01:08:29,064
You didn't actuaIIy think
I was going to Iet that bus Ieave, did you?

950
01:08:29,305 --> 01:08:31,000
ActuaIIy, I didn't.

951
01:08:32,274 --> 01:08:35,209
-What the heII is he doing?
-I have no idea.

952
01:08:35,544 --> 01:08:38,809
Come on, man,
don't make me say some cIiche Iine, okay?

953
01:08:42,218 --> 01:08:44,448
-No.
-Come on, come on.

954
01:08:44,553 --> 01:08:45,679
Shit!

955
01:08:45,921 --> 01:08:47,855
-Move, move!
-Hit it.

956
01:08:48,557 --> 01:08:50,718
-We shouId wait.
-Stay right there.

957
01:08:50,926 --> 01:08:51,893
Hit it.

958
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:54,694
Get the heII out of here!

959
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:57,129
To the Ieft. A IittIe more.

960
01:08:57,299 --> 01:08:58,960
Stand over here. Move with me.

961
01:08:59,068 --> 01:09:01,662
-Buzz, come on!
-We can't Ieave him!

962
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:04,103
Come on, goddamn it! Go!

963
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:05,966
Bingo.

964
01:09:18,821 --> 01:09:19,879
Shit!

965
01:09:24,593 --> 01:09:26,458
Stop that bus!

966
01:09:26,929 --> 01:09:28,453
That son of a bitch!

967
01:09:28,697 --> 01:09:29,664
HoId on!

968
01:09:40,042 --> 01:09:42,408
What are you doing? Move that car!

969
01:09:43,913 --> 01:09:44,880
Up yours.

970
01:09:46,582 --> 01:09:48,641
Go, BiIIy! God damn you! Go!

971
01:09:55,891 --> 01:09:57,620
Come on, guys. Let's go.

972
01:10:19,949 --> 01:10:23,476
I'm gonna take him out
if it's the Iast thing I do.

973
01:10:37,366 --> 01:10:38,958
This is from SoI.

974
01:10:48,344 --> 01:10:53,247
l, Sol Jacobs, being of not so sound mind
for getting caught up in this mess...

975
01:10:53,349 --> 01:10:57,251
...and obviously not of sound body,
l'm dead...

976
01:10:57,620 --> 01:11:01,021
...do hereby declare this
my last will and testament.

977
01:11:01,457 --> 01:11:05,086
l bequeath everything l have
to my friend Jesse Reilly.

978
01:11:06,395 --> 01:11:09,159
l don't know what three years
of a man's life is worth...

979
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:11,199
...but one thing l do know...

980
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:13,928
...is that life itself ain't
worth much without love.

981
01:11:14,737 --> 01:11:18,070
l guess that makes you
one of the richest men l know.

982
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:20,167
l love you, Jesse...

983
01:11:20,376 --> 01:11:22,867
...at least as much as a man
can love another man...

984
01:11:22,978 --> 01:11:25,503
...without being gay. Sorry, Buzz.

985
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:30,244
As for you other guys,
your legal fees far exceed...

986
01:11:30,352 --> 01:11:32,684
...anything l have left to give to you.

987
01:11:32,888 --> 01:11:35,755
So, l bequeath to you
my eternal friendship.

988
01:11:36,825 --> 01:11:38,918
l do have one final request.

989
01:11:40,195 --> 01:11:41,560
Remember me.

990
01:12:05,988 --> 01:12:07,580
How about an interview?

991
01:12:08,824 --> 01:12:09,882
What?

992
01:12:10,492 --> 01:12:13,461
Do you have anything to say to America?

993
01:12:18,967 --> 01:12:21,527
''To thine own seIf be true.''

994
01:12:22,738 --> 01:12:23,727
What?

995
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:27,867
I'm a Green Beret, I Iove my country...

996
01:12:29,144 --> 01:12:30,236
...and I'm gay.

997
01:12:46,929 --> 01:12:49,193
-Let's go. Move it.
-I'm trying.

998
01:12:55,771 --> 01:12:58,069
AII right, I'm sick of this shit.

999
01:13:09,251 --> 01:13:10,275
Car!

1000
01:13:12,554 --> 01:13:13,543
Jesus.

1001
01:13:13,655 --> 01:13:15,850
Why don't you
smoke crack whiIe you're at it?

1002
01:13:20,329 --> 01:13:21,489
No turning back now.

1003
01:13:21,997 --> 01:13:24,591
You guys, they're getting cIoser.

1004
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:30,671
Come on, baby! Come on!

1005
01:13:32,474 --> 01:13:33,771
We gotta do something.

1006
01:13:34,376 --> 01:13:35,365
Turn here.

1007
01:13:35,477 --> 01:13:37,035
-What?
-Just do it!

1008
01:13:58,066 --> 01:14:00,933
Shit! They jumped the goddamn ramp.

1009
01:14:02,271 --> 01:14:05,502
We got 'em now.
There's no exit on that road untiI Castaic.

1010
01:14:07,509 --> 01:14:10,205
This is Hoover.
Suspects are on Highway 91.

1011
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:13,313
Set up the roadbIock at OId MiII Road.

1012
01:14:13,649 --> 01:14:15,640
We'II cut them off at the pass.

1013
01:14:31,834 --> 01:14:33,358
What the fuck was that?

1014
01:14:42,344 --> 01:14:44,938
Red Dog 1, this is Gonzo.

1015
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:46,445
We have our boys in sight.

1016
01:14:46,548 --> 01:14:49,312
Gonna pIuck a few chickens
before the woIves get here.

1017
01:15:00,295 --> 01:15:02,627
I want my snipers Iining
the entire perimeter.

1018
01:15:02,731 --> 01:15:04,699
-Is that cIear?
-Yes, sir.

1019
01:15:08,804 --> 01:15:10,635
I want snipers up in the tree Iines.

1020
01:15:10,739 --> 01:15:13,173
The rest,
position yourseIves around these cars.

1021
01:15:13,275 --> 01:15:16,210
-What's he doing?
-Come on, we gotta cIimb onboard.

1022
01:15:16,311 --> 01:15:19,405
-That's crazy.
-You got a better idea?

1023
01:15:19,681 --> 01:15:20,875
Come on.

1024
01:15:24,286 --> 01:15:25,878
Come on, Iet's go!

1025
01:15:29,658 --> 01:15:32,058
Come on! We're running out of time!

1026
01:15:33,061 --> 01:15:35,791
-Be carefuI!
-AII right, cIimb up. Come on.

1027
01:15:42,571 --> 01:15:44,163
Bring it in here!

1028
01:15:45,274 --> 01:15:46,866
Hope, come on up!

1029
01:15:47,876 --> 01:15:50,071
Come on! You got it!

1030
01:15:56,952 --> 01:15:57,919
Shit!

1031
01:15:59,054 --> 01:16:01,648
-Jesse, hang on!
-I'm okay!

1032
01:16:02,357 --> 01:16:04,052

1033
01:16:07,596 --> 01:16:08,654
Hope.

1034
01:16:28,116 --> 01:16:30,914
-What the heII was that?
-I don't know.

1035
01:16:33,789 --> 01:16:35,086
-Okay.
-Grab his hand.

1036
01:16:35,357 --> 01:16:36,483
Hope, come on!

1037
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:42,655
Take my hand!

1038
01:16:44,967 --> 01:16:47,561
Red Dog 1, got gooks on the wire.

1039
01:16:49,871 --> 01:16:51,634
CIoser!

1040
01:16:51,974 --> 01:16:54,670
-Grab for it! Come on!

1041
01:16:57,112 --> 01:16:58,511
-Okay.
-Go!

1042
01:16:59,848 --> 01:17:01,008
HoId on!

1043
01:17:26,274 --> 01:17:27,639
Why are we sIowing down?

1044
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:30,971
They rigged the fucking gauge.

1045
01:17:32,314 --> 01:17:34,475
I gotta get them out of here.

1046
01:17:50,232 --> 01:17:52,894
Come on! BiIIy, Iet's go!

1047
01:17:53,702 --> 01:17:55,192
Take the money!

1048
01:17:55,604 --> 01:17:57,538
-What are you doing?
-Take it!

1049
01:17:59,708 --> 01:18:00,697
Go!

1050
01:18:09,317 --> 01:18:10,306
Come on, BiIIy!

1051
01:18:10,986 --> 01:18:13,546
-There's not enough time!
-BuIIshit! Come on!

1052
01:18:16,858 --> 01:18:18,883
Red Dog 1, I am taking fire.

1053
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:26,589
Go!

1054
01:18:33,709 --> 01:18:35,768
BiIIy, get them out of here!

1055
01:18:36,645 --> 01:18:40,411
Go! Live Iong and procreate!

1056
01:18:45,387 --> 01:18:46,752
Red Dog 1...

1057
01:18:47,622 --> 01:18:49,453
...we are headed for the border.

1058
01:18:52,461 --> 01:18:55,259
-What is that?
-It's our wedding present.

1059
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:40,635
Stay cooI, you guys.

1060
01:19:41,276 --> 01:19:42,971
Good Iuck, you aII.

1061
01:19:45,781 --> 01:19:46,839
See ya.

1062
01:20:16,011 --> 01:20:19,105
We got a caII from Pursuit.
The hostages are recovered unharmed.

1063
01:20:19,214 --> 01:20:21,045
Good. They're aII mine now.

1064
01:20:21,149 --> 01:20:22,878
When they come around the bend...

1065
01:20:22,984 --> 01:20:25,282
...I want the driver
and their tires taken out.

1066
01:20:25,387 --> 01:20:26,547
Standard procedure--

1067
01:20:26,655 --> 01:20:30,250
I don't give a fuck about procedure
and don't have time for insubordination.

1068
01:20:30,358 --> 01:20:31,985
Now, Iock and Ioad.

1069
01:20:32,394 --> 01:20:33,622
Yes, sir.

1070
01:20:49,244 --> 01:20:50,973
''To be, or not to be:

1071
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:53,643
''That is the question:

1072
01:20:55,750 --> 01:20:57,980
''Whether 'tis nobIer in the mind to suffer...

1073
01:20:58,086 --> 01:21:00,680
''...the sIings and arrows
of outrageous fortune...

1074
01:21:01,056 --> 01:21:03,786
''...or to take arms
against a sea of troubIes...

1075
01:21:03,892 --> 01:21:05,860
''...and by opposing end them?

1076
01:21:07,262 --> 01:21:09,662
''To die: to sIeep;

1077
01:21:11,166 --> 01:21:12,463
''No more;

1078
01:21:14,102 --> 01:21:16,468
''And by a sIeep to say
we end the heart-ache...

1079
01:21:16,571 --> 01:21:19,870
''...and the thousand naturaI shocks
that fIesh is heir to...

1080
01:21:20,876 --> 01:21:23,640
''...'tis a consummation
devoutIy to be wish'd.

1081
01:21:25,013 --> 01:21:26,173
''To die;

01:21:27,082 --> 01:21:28,413
''To sIeep;

01:21:31,019 --> 01:21:32,714
''Perchance to dream:

1084
01:21:33,588 --> 01:21:35,317
''Ay, there's the rub;

1085
01:21:36,892 --> 01:21:39,690
''For in that sIeep of death
what dreams may come...

1086
01:21:39,794 --> 01:21:43,321
''...when we have shuffIed off
this mortaI coiI must give us pause.

1087

''Who wouId fardeIs bear,
to grunt and sweat under a weary Iife...

1088
01:21:50,105 --> 01:21:52,972
''...but that the dread

1089
01:21:53,475 --> 01:21:55,409
''...the undiscover'd country...

01:21:56,578 --> 01:22:00,105

1091
01:22:00,482 --> 01:22:03,280

bear those iIIs we have...

1092

1093
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:12,059
''Thus conscience does make

1094
01:22:13,094 --> 01:22:14,823
On my order, Carter.

1095
01:22:18,833 --> 01:22:20,824
''Be aII my sins remember'd.''

1096
01:22:35,283 --> 01:22:37,410
A IittIe cIoser.

1097
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:43,121
And....

1098
01:22:50,632 --> 01:22:51,656
Now.

1099
01:24:04,339 --> 01:24:06,034
So much for that margarita.

1100
01:24:11,146 --> 01:24:12,977
How many you got Ieft?

1101
01:24:20,155 --> 01:24:21,087
One.

1102
01:24:22,157 --> 01:24:23,215
Yeah.

1103
01:24:24,759 --> 01:24:25,783
Me, too.

1104
01:24:27,595 --> 01:24:29,324
That's aII it takes.

1105
01:24:30,999 --> 01:24:32,057
Yeah.

1106
01:24:48,416 --> 01:24:49,576
Thanks.

1107
01:25:25,420 --> 01:25:27,115
Cease fire!

1108
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:36,563
They're down, sir.

1109
01:25:37,132 --> 01:25:38,156
Sir?

1110
01:25:58,119 --> 01:25:59,484
SoI!

1111
01:26:03,358 --> 01:26:05,189
Stay out of the water!

1112
01:26:08,796 --> 01:26:10,764
Come here, you.

1113
01:26:15,637 --> 01:26:18,037
Hi, baby.
