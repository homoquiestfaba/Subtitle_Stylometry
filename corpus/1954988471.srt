00:01:04,465 --> 00:01:05,433
Sick, killed, or injured?

3
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,269
No. No, he's just stoned.

4
00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:09,637
Okay to book, charges?

5
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:11,272
Homicide.

6
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:12,240
All right.

7
00:01:13,474 --> 00:01:15,443
Um, doesn't look great,
he'll be up for a while.

8
00:01:15,476 --> 00:01:17,978
Put him to the process, then
we'll get him over to county.

9
00:01:37,198 --> 00:01:38,366
Intercom: Next inmate, window 3.

10
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:42,803
Gentlemen, let's pump it up.

11
00:01:43,271 --> 00:01:44,172
Keep the line moving.

12
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,142
Crash is ready for pick up.

13
00:01:49,377 --> 00:01:52,346
Bring him in the K-11.
Johnson's here for pick up.

14
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,515
Police radio: Ninety six
days with the doctor.

15
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:55,549
Give me a few minutes.

16
00:01:58,286 --> 00:01:58,852
I'll wait.

17
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:10,564
Allergies.

18
00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:13,901
I don't like this.

19
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:16,737
Next inmate, window 7.

20
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:25,379
That's Saxx, Raymond.

21
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:27,981
Homicide 187.

22
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:30,284
Transferred over
from Beverly Hills.

23
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:32,253
Can't even question him
until he sobers up.

24
00:02:33,321 --> 00:02:34,054
Beverly Hills.

25
00:03:06,287 --> 00:03:09,122
Can we, uh, rush him through
classification for you?

26
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:12,793
Get him out of here?

27
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:48,296
Sweet dreams, sunshine.

28
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,273
Oh, oh.

29
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,434
Hi.

30
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:34,608
I'm the Butterfly, supreme
symbol of change, silly.

31
00:04:40,648 --> 00:04:42,650
Jeez, are you okay?

32
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:45,319
I need to fix...

33
00:04:46,454 --> 00:04:47,287
I know.

34
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:50,358
Please, can you help me?

35
00:04:50,391 --> 00:04:52,660
Mmm, uh-uh.

36
00:04:53,361 --> 00:04:55,463
No, I can't help
you right now.

37
00:04:56,897 --> 00:04:58,866
We're going to be
here all weekend.

38
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,837
Oh, but why is it so
fucking cold in here?

39
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:12,079
This will help.

40
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:53,286
What the fuck is K-11?

41
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:59,393
Well, if they kill
you on the mainline,

42
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:03,063
You get to go at K-11.

43
00:06:07,535 --> 00:06:12,806
I like to think it's a
sanctuary for broken toys.

44
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:17,711
You know, a
away from home.

45
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:20,748
I wanna go home.

46
00:06:23,451 --> 00:06:24,585
Not me.

47
00:06:28,489 --> 00:06:30,424
I'm fucking dying.

48
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:38,031
Oh, Mark and Junior said to
tell you, that they will be

49
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:41,301
Back in next Thursday and
that they will have the kind.

50
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:43,070
Today, already!

51
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:44,572
Oh, no, you didn't!

52
00:06:44,972 --> 00:06:46,440
You dare rush me?

53
00:06:47,508 --> 00:06:50,277
You must be out of your
damn mind rushing me like, oh.

54
00:06:53,581 --> 00:06:56,416
Whoo! This is
not my fault.

55
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,819
Your man, Johnson,
he'd never picked me up.

56
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,257
Wait around for a rookie.

57
00:07:04,492 --> 00:07:05,425
Oh, what the fuck?

58
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:07,795
Yeah and I waited
the whole morning.

59
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:08,829
He fucked up, man!

60
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:09,863
I could've gotten pinched.

61
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,808
All right, man,
you're off the hook.

62
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:22,610
Fuck it.

63
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:27,481
Count time.

64
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:31,619
K-11, 10 minutes
to count time.

65
00:07:31,652 --> 00:07:33,521
This rumor is just
excessively cruel.

66
00:07:33,554 --> 00:07:35,789
I mean, chili sauce that is
so hot, you can actually burn

67
00:07:35,823 --> 00:07:37,625
Away cancer cells.

68
00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:40,193
The American Medical...

69
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:42,963
Show is over.

70
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:50,470
Walking!

71
00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:54,007
I'll take it from
here, lieutenant.

72
00:07:56,644 --> 00:07:58,579
Don't get distracted
by the females in here.

73
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:00,648
There aren't any
females in here.

74
00:08:01,549 --> 00:08:04,017
If you touch one of them and
your dick is gonna fall off.

75
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:07,387
Relax, Harris.

76
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,489
Every rookie does at
least four weeks here.

77
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:11,592
Most of them survive.

78
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:13,293
Let's do this.

79
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,628
Let's do it down here.

80
00:08:14,662 --> 00:08:16,163
Harris, take the other aisle.

81
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:22,703
K-11, face down
and your arms out.

82
00:08:24,738 --> 00:08:25,739
No talking.

83
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:38,518
Hey, come on,
face down, arms out.

84
00:08:39,987 --> 00:08:41,021
I don't wanna touch you.

85
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:42,923
Yes, I'm sorry,
sir. Just napping.

86
00:08:45,593 --> 00:08:48,028
Intercomm: Crowds
clears. Good night.

87
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:50,497
She'll want
these in red.

88
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:54,935
I like the
leather stripes.

89
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:57,571
Hold your horses!

[Knock on the door]

91
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:08,215
You almost
blew it, man!

92
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,683
You have to be
more careful.

93
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:11,852
And what the hell
are you talking about?

94
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:13,220
You're a bust.

95
00:09:30,938 --> 00:09:31,805
I'll have
some of that.

96
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:37,377
But... no, you won't. I already
gave you a fold this morning.

97
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,746
Where did it go?

98
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,615
I bought someone.

99
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:44,484
Oh, great.

100
00:09:44,985 --> 00:09:47,087
Great, great and
Precious almost got busted.

101
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,990
And you can't follow
a simple direction.

102
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:54,427
No, maybe it's time
that, uh, I cut your back.

103
00:09:54,728 --> 00:09:56,263
Oh, no, no.

104
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:57,631
You can't do that.

105
00:09:58,131 --> 00:09:59,599
Oh, yeah. I can.

106
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:03,136
All right, look. You're getting
sloppy and sloppy is dangerous.

107
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,738
I think you're forgetting
mister that I'm the one who's

108
00:10:04,772 --> 00:10:06,774
In charge here not you.

109
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:07,808
I could have you
declassified right now

110
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:08,909
And take all your drugs.

111
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,043
What do you think of that?

112
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:12,212
I can have you
tested right now.

113
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:14,314
And your piss is toxic.

114
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:17,885
All right, so if
I lose, you lose.

115
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:19,753
Know this.

116
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:39,472
This is 58 car 17.

117

118
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,743
This is RTO, go ahead.

119
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:45,813
RTO, notify watch
commander, we have a 187

What the fuck!

126
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:18,178
Last night, you
fainted and hit your head.

127
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:22,482
I got scared because you bled.

128
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,953
So, I cleaned you up
and wrapped you up

129
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:27,721
And kept you
warm instead.

130
00:11:35,763 --> 00:11:38,331
You've been asleep
for a quite some time.

131
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:50,710
You should just try to relax.

132
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:54,714

Relax, Mr. Saxx.

136
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,734
I have been taking care
of people for a long time.

137
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:25,145
I'm here because I
took care of my daddy.

138

Bad things come to bad people.

139
00:12:34,822 --> 00:12:36,489
So, I think you'll be fine.

140
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:52,906

change, hurry up.

wanna walk out here

Come on, get that crap off.

bunk soon.

I'll keep you safe.

You know that you can't
be in there by yourself,

184

Hey!

186
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:52,905

187
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:55,442
Hey, you only
get one call.

188
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:56,976
Back in line.

Fuck.

Yeah, I missed
you too.

192
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:09,222
I gotta tell you, it's just
not the same without you here.

193
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:10,590
I was gone for one week.

194
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:12,058
Take these off already.

195
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,228
Oh, you know I like it
when you're restrained.

196
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:25,172
What?

197
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:27,474
Come into my office
and make love to me,

198
00:18:27,507 --> 00:18:28,775
It's been so long.

199
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:31,911
No, I just got here
and I wanna clean up.

200
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:34,147
Streets are nasty.

201
00:18:34,181 --> 00:18:36,115
That's fine, I can wait.

202
00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:39,619
But I think you should know
that Crystal has been

203
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:40,720
Working Ben all week.

204
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:42,822
And she's the
new house mouse.

205
00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:46,159
Well, I'm back now.

206
00:18:46,193 --> 00:18:48,561
Besides, Ben is a man.

207
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:51,030
I wouldn't expect
him to go without.

208
00:18:52,532 --> 00:18:55,001
I would never do
that, I love you.

209
00:18:56,169 --> 00:18:58,171
Just come in to the
office for a minute.

210
00:18:58,205 --> 00:19:03,276
Bully, touch me
now, give me my shit!

211
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,777
Ordale!

212
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:24,231
I took very good care
of that like you want.

213
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:26,299
Don't, don't
worry it's all there,

214
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,634
It's all there.

215
00:19:30,637 --> 00:19:31,671
Liar!

216
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:36,142
This was a quarter and now
it's less than an eighth.

217
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:38,645
You know, we always
got your fat sack,

218
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,380
But you steal from us anyway.

219
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:43,350
I'm watching you,
Gerald, and so is Ben.

220
00:19:43,383 --> 00:19:44,284
Please don't get
mad at me, baby.

221
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:45,718
I don't wanna hear it!

222
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:53,260
Open the door.

223
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:03,403
[Whispering]
This was all...

224
00:20:03,436 --> 00:20:05,605
Close it, quietly.

225
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:19,252
**

226
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:37,430
Time for chow?

227
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:39,966
Mamma, go back to sleep. You
don't need to see this.

228
00:21:44,704 --> 00:21:48,107
I said, wake up,
you motherfuckers.

229
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,476
Radio!

230
00:21:51,711 --> 00:21:53,346
[Screams in Spanish]

231
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:07,293
You fucking bitch.

232
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:14,834
[Cursing in Spanish]

233
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:16,969
I'm sorry!

234
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:26,379
I'm gone for one week.

235
00:22:26,413 --> 00:22:32,385
Working, mind you and I come
back to find this in my bed.

236
00:22:33,219 --> 00:22:35,688
Unacceptable!

237
00:22:35,722 --> 00:22:37,424
Stay out of my shit.

238
00:22:40,393 --> 00:22:43,396
You, stand by me
and hold my hand.

239
00:22:44,397 --> 00:22:45,565
Now!

240
00:22:51,604 --> 00:22:52,839
Boys?

241
00:22:56,075 --> 00:23:00,513
Yes, I am that bitch.

242
00:23:00,847 --> 00:23:04,851
The mouse is back and I
run this dorm in and out.

243
00:23:05,418 --> 00:23:07,887
Any of you got a
problem with that?

244
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,489
Step up.

245
00:23:09,522 --> 00:23:12,291
Right fucking now!

246
00:23:16,463 --> 00:23:17,396
That's my girl.

247
00:23:19,699 --> 00:23:24,437
You play with me,
you get uglier.

248
00:23:24,471 --> 00:23:25,538
Just like this bitch.

249
00:23:29,609 --> 00:23:31,143
Whew!

250
00:23:34,447 --> 00:23:36,082
Any questions?

251
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,752
Good.

252
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,308
Intercomm: Lieutenant Johnson,
see the captain in his office.

253
00:24:04,511 --> 00:24:05,912
I'll be right back.

254

Take your time.

255
00:24:49,455 --> 00:24:54,661
Kay-Kay, Crystal...

256
00:24:54,694 --> 00:24:57,029
Bring me that fish.

257

[Laughing]

258
00:25:02,635 --> 00:25:04,170
Train! Train!

259
00:25:04,537 --> 00:25:06,539
New fish
everybody!

260
00:25:06,573 --> 00:25:07,439
Come on,
let's go.

261
00:25:07,473 --> 00:25:07,974
Where, where
are we going?

262
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:09,876
To see Mousey.

263
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:12,244
No, no, I need
to use the phone.

264
00:25:14,714 --> 00:25:16,816
Oh, shit, I'm
gonna be sick.

265
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:18,050
Why?

266
00:25:18,084 --> 00:25:19,719
Am I ugly to you?

267
00:25:19,752 --> 00:25:21,654
Do I make you
sick or something?

268
00:25:21,688 --> 00:25:25,057
Girls, really, really, I need...
I need to lay down, I'm sick.

269

Look at his dirty ass.
He is disgusting.

270
00:25:27,326 --> 00:25:28,327
Hands off
then, bitch.

271

Hey, what

272
00:25:31,664 --> 00:25:32,665
Enough.

273
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:46,012
Sit.

274
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:47,379
No.

275
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:49,816
I said sit down.

276
00:25:49,849 --> 00:25:51,651
I can't.

277
00:25:51,684 --> 00:25:53,385
She said, sit
down, asshole.

278
00:25:54,086 --> 00:25:55,254
Thank you, boys.

279
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:12,204
Listen, fish,
here are the rules.

280
00:26:13,005 --> 00:26:16,542
You can slap a girl but
you can never hit her.

281
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,210
Boys are fair game.

282
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:22,682
You steal, you get
your ass beat... badly.

283
00:26:22,715 --> 00:26:24,851
You want a
cigarette, you pay for it.

284
00:26:24,884 --> 00:26:27,854
You want some
dope, you pay for it.

285
00:26:27,887 --> 00:26:30,589
Got race issues?

286
00:26:30,623 --> 00:26:35,061
Get rid of them but
don't play that in here.

287
00:26:36,696 --> 00:26:40,700
I'm the queen and
this is my kingdom.

288
00:26:40,733 --> 00:26:43,502
You're in my world now.

289
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:48,574
Mind your manners or
you'll answer to me.

290
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:49,608
Get it?

291
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:51,310
Sure, yeah.

292
00:26:54,781 --> 00:26:59,218
Hey wait, before you
leave, I have to know.

293
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:02,388
Why are you here?

294
00:27:02,421 --> 00:27:05,224
Oh, that's really none
of your fucking business.

295
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,060
The only thing
you need to know.

296
00:27:08,094 --> 00:27:09,395
I don't belong here.

297
00:27:09,428 --> 00:27:13,099
Somebody made a fucking
mistake and I'm not crazy.

298
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:18,104
Well, Huerto,
I am.

299
00:27:22,308 --> 00:27:24,176
And you better
be careful.

300
00:27:27,814 --> 00:27:29,115
You want some
of this?

301
00:27:32,018 --> 00:27:33,753
Sure, yeah.

302
00:27:34,787 --> 00:27:35,788
You got something
to trade?

303
00:27:35,822 --> 00:27:36,588
No.

304
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:40,626
That's a pity.

305
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:44,430
Fuera!

306
00:27:56,542 --> 00:27:58,677
Don't you even think
about walking down here.

307
00:28:02,148 --> 00:28:04,350
Gee, I... sorry.

308
00:28:13,793 --> 00:28:17,696
I'm warning you, boy, don't
you ever step into my driveway

309
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:19,665
Without permission.

310
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,734
Yeah, whatever, man.

311
00:28:24,236 --> 00:28:26,372
Look like this fish
is swimming up stream.

312
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:29,675
Yeah, I wonder who's fishin'?

313
00:28:31,844 --> 00:28:33,846
Intercomm: K-11, line
up for mail call.

314
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,748
Don't forget the store.

315

318
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:53,732
Yes!

319
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,401
That's it.

320
00:28:55,768 --> 00:28:56,368
Sorry guys.

321
00:28:57,403 --> 00:28:59,205
You know I love you.

322
00:28:59,906 --> 00:29:01,774
I miss you too, Papi Chulo.

323
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:04,276
I'll be home soon.

324
00:29:10,616 --> 00:29:12,751
Baby, I would
never cheat on you.

325
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:18,724
You wanna know a secret?

326
00:29:20,927 --> 00:29:22,194
Promise you won't tell anyone?

327
00:29:22,795 --> 00:29:24,430
I get hard when I
think about you.

328
00:29:25,798 --> 00:29:26,966
We should hook up.

329
00:29:28,534 --> 00:29:30,602
MMM - It's just been so long
since I've been with a real man.

330
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,809
Stop fucking with me, bitch!

331
00:29:38,811 --> 00:29:39,711
You shouldn't have
done that, Papi.

332
00:29:48,955 --> 00:29:51,891

I'm, I'm in some
kind of an institution.

I mean, look, you need
to get me out of there.

345
00:30:22,421 --> 00:30:23,589
I need a fucking lawyer.

I fired C.R.

347
00:30:24,623 --> 00:30:27,159
He's a fucking asshole.

I told ya, don't you
ever touch a girl.

352
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:37,904
What the fuck are
you talking about?

353
00:30:37,937 --> 00:30:39,305
I didn't hit anybody.

Can a nigger make a
phone call up in here,

Nobody hit nobody.

You bitch! You know
better than to lie to me!

359
00:30:55,721 --> 00:30:59,558
And you better slow
your roll, Huerto.

360
00:31:00,226 --> 00:31:02,561
Trust me, you don't
want him defending you.

361
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:11,803
Oh, baby.

362
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:14,806
Did you get it?

363
00:31:16,042 --> 00:31:17,543
You know it.

364
00:31:20,012 --> 00:31:21,347
I love you.

365
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,889
Oh, fuck!

366
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:42,068
Check this out, *I'm
going crazy for my liberty,

367
00:31:42,101 --> 00:31:46,905
And now my freedom's gone
away and got nothing to say.*

368
00:31:46,939 --> 00:31:48,874
And then like... [Humming]

369
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,542
What's that
last part?

370
00:31:51,543 --> 00:31:53,045
That's the part
I gotta fill in.

371
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,081
Fill it in with
that crazy part.

372
00:31:55,114 --> 00:31:58,317
- Yeah. I like that.
- Me too.

373
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,051
Get up!

374
00:31:59,952 --> 00:32:01,053
Just give me a
second, brother.

375
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:03,889
Get up, sister.

376
00:32:04,957 --> 00:32:06,825
Don't be playing on
the floor, sugar.

377
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:07,994
You know what goes
on up in here.

378
00:32:08,027 --> 00:32:10,696
Aw man! You got no
respect for art.

379
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:14,300
Okay.

380
00:32:14,967 --> 00:32:15,901
You're all done.

381
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:23,775
We cool?

382
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:25,077
Uh-hmm.

383
00:32:29,215 --> 00:32:30,782
Hey, you know?

384
00:32:30,816 --> 00:32:32,518
You can't let her put her
hands on you like that.

385
00:32:32,551 --> 00:32:34,553
Gotta have
respect for yourself.

386
00:32:35,254 --> 00:32:36,455
Trust me.

387
00:32:36,488 --> 00:32:38,257
This here is Hollywood.

388
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:41,060
He was the lead singer
for Stainless Steel.

389
00:32:42,628 --> 00:32:43,562
Ray.

390
00:32:49,435 --> 00:32:53,139
You know, I know that
guy from somewhere.

391
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:56,575
What do I have to do to
get a shower in here?

392
00:32:57,576 --> 00:32:59,078
Well, you just have to wait,
sugar until 'till I'm

393
00:32:59,111 --> 00:33:01,047
Done cleaning, that's all.

394
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,048
Here.

395
00:33:02,081 --> 00:33:03,115
Here's a fish kit.

396
00:33:03,149 --> 00:33:06,052
You come back in a
few minutes and don't

397
00:33:06,085 --> 00:33:08,120
Forget your towel,
it's in your bedroll.

398
00:33:08,154 --> 00:33:09,255
All right.

399
00:33:09,288 --> 00:33:13,325
Oh, lookey here.
Who's here?

400
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:14,993
Oh, thank you so much darling.

401
00:33:15,027 --> 00:33:16,428
It's all yours.

402
00:33:16,462 --> 00:33:17,896
Uh-hmm.

403
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:19,831
You?

404
00:33:19,865 --> 00:33:21,033
Out!

405
00:33:30,109 --> 00:33:30,942
Bye-bye, Ray!

406
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:32,544
See you later, mate.

407
00:33:46,058 --> 00:33:47,025
Raymond Saxx.

408
00:33:52,331 --> 00:33:53,465
Oh, c'mon.

409
00:33:57,169 --> 00:34:00,172
More, motherfuckers, more. Hold
it up, you're gonna drop it.

410
00:34:00,206 --> 00:34:02,141
Precious, if you
drop your corner,

411
00:34:02,174 --> 00:34:03,375
I'm gonna beat you.

412
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:06,912
Walking!

413
00:34:16,088 --> 00:34:17,089
Hey.

414
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:18,657
Clear!

415
00:34:22,861 --> 00:34:24,163
Come on, come on!

416
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:25,597
Hey, hey, hey!

417
00:34:38,544 --> 00:34:39,245
Hi!

418
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:46,218
Butterfly loves Lifesavers.

419
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,121
Lifesavers.

420
00:35:15,281 --> 00:35:19,151
Butterfly loves you.

421
00:35:32,331 --> 00:35:35,234
She loves me...

422
00:35:39,238 --> 00:35:42,441
Nobody ever loved me...

423
00:36:06,332 --> 00:36:08,667
Mrs. Detroit.

424
00:36:11,703 --> 00:36:12,704
See?

425
00:36:13,439 --> 00:36:14,773
Now you have curtains.

426
00:36:21,647 --> 00:36:23,682
Thanks sweetie,
that's so nice.

427
00:36:28,354 --> 00:36:31,223
Oh, Butterfly loves Snickers.

428
00:36:32,624 --> 00:36:33,859
Here, we can trade.

429
00:36:35,327 --> 00:36:37,028
Butterfly hates
Black Licorice.

430
00:36:50,342 --> 00:36:56,315
Goodbye... Mr. Saxx.

431
00:37:07,259 --> 00:37:08,527
See you at chow time.

432
00:37:17,436 --> 00:37:18,437
No, silly.

433
00:37:19,505 --> 00:37:21,873
I need to have a
nap right now.

434
00:37:22,674 --> 00:37:23,909
Not now.

435
00:37:23,942 --> 00:37:25,811
You love me.

436
00:37:25,844 --> 00:37:27,078
Remember?

437
00:37:27,112 --> 00:37:29,581
Stop it!
Stop it!

438
00:37:29,615 --> 00:37:32,318
I will, as soon as I'm done.

439
00:37:32,351 --> 00:37:33,419
No!

440
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,254
Be a good little girl.

441
00:37:36,288 --> 00:37:38,357
No, I don't want to!

442
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:46,031
I'm HIV.

443
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:50,402
What?!

444
00:37:50,436 --> 00:37:52,103
You want in on this?

445
00:37:52,137 --> 00:37:53,939
No, I don't want to.

446
00:37:53,972 --> 00:37:55,273
You don't have no choice!

447
00:37:55,307 --> 00:37:58,677
No! No!

448
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:01,112
I'm HIV! I have HIV!

449
00:38:01,146 --> 00:38:03,081
Good, so am I!

450
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:06,318
No!

451
00:38:06,918 --> 00:38:07,719
No!

452
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,457
Please!

453
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:13,625
Turn your butt!

454
00:38:13,659 --> 00:38:14,493
Yeah!

455
00:38:15,494 --> 00:38:17,028
No! No!

456
00:38:17,062 --> 00:38:20,165
No! No!

457
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:24,470
No, please!

458
00:38:25,837 --> 00:38:28,840
Intercom: K-11,
line up for chow.

459
00:38:35,914 --> 00:38:38,917
Intercom: K-11,
line up for chow.

460
00:38:55,867 --> 00:38:58,870
Intercom: K-11,
line up for chow.

461
00:39:15,887 --> 00:39:18,890
Intercom: K-11,
line up for chow.

462
00:39:40,546 --> 00:39:41,413
Hey you, come here.

463
00:39:42,748 --> 00:39:43,749
What?

464
00:39:45,417 --> 00:39:46,418
What's this?

465
00:39:47,553 --> 00:39:48,520
It's only food.

466
00:39:49,521 --> 00:39:50,489
Well, what's wrong with you?

467
00:39:50,522 --> 00:39:53,792
You can't read?

468
00:39:53,825 --> 00:39:54,993
Get rid of it.

469
00:39:57,929 --> 00:39:58,697
Up against the wall.

470
00:39:59,431 --> 00:40:00,365
Move!

471
00:40:08,507 --> 00:40:09,441
No sitting on the floor.

472
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:52,551
Evening, ma'am

473
00:40:53,084 --> 00:40:54,319
Hey, Lem.

474
00:40:54,886 --> 00:40:58,323
All right.
Everything's in order,

475
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:02,027
But, uh, I think that
Johnson's asleep at his desk.

476
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:04,563
He must be fighting
with his Mama again.

477
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:23,414
What the hell are you doing?

478
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:25,517
Business.

479
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:27,519
Did I give you permission
to pass along another fold?

480
00:41:28,687 --> 00:41:29,755
What?

481
00:41:29,788 --> 00:41:31,757
Since when do I
need your permission?

482
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:35,260
Since I think you're
giving away too much.

483
00:41:35,293 --> 00:41:38,063
I'm not giving anything
away for free, all right?

484
00:41:38,096 --> 00:41:40,165
You're the only
that doesn't pay.

485
00:41:40,198 --> 00:41:42,200
This is a business, remember?

486
00:41:42,968 --> 00:41:45,270
Well, I think I need a
bigger share of the business.

487
00:41:45,303 --> 00:41:47,606
And I think you're
stealing me blind.

488
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:53,311
Look, a dope fiend and a
cop is a nasty combination.

489
00:41:55,547 --> 00:41:56,682
You have a good
evening now.

490
00:41:56,715 --> 00:41:57,549
All right,
you, too.

491
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:05,891
All right, line up
for pill call.

492
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,543
Stewart.

493
00:42:26,211 --> 00:42:27,345
Harris.

494
00:42:30,616 --> 00:42:31,650
Pill call!

495
00:42:35,453 --> 00:42:36,487
Come on people, let's go!

496
00:43:24,703 --> 00:43:25,704
No way.

497
00:43:29,708 --> 00:43:34,980
Hey, uh, ShyBoy. Got a
senior with an issue here.

498
00:43:35,013 --> 00:43:36,381
Can she step up?

499
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:37,716
Goddamn it.

500
00:43:37,749 --> 00:43:39,918
Alright, come on.

501
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:41,419
Move it!

502
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:52,698
Excuse me, honey. But this is
only Coumadin and Valium.

503
00:43:52,731 --> 00:43:54,399
I needs my laxative, too.

504
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,334
I'm sorry, Mr. Robbin.

505
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:58,203
But the doctor didn't
prescribe laxative.

506
00:43:58,236 --> 00:43:59,604
Well, that's a mistake.

507
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:01,840
I ain't ACLU's free homos like
these other girls.

508
00:44:01,873 --> 00:44:04,876
I have a real problem
and that doctor knows it!

509
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:06,544
Look, there it's right there.

510
00:44:06,577 --> 00:44:07,979
Just hand me some.

511
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:11,883
Now miss thing,

512
00:44:11,917 --> 00:44:14.085
'Cause I ain't leavin'
here without my laxative.

513
00:44:15,286 --> 00:44:16,922
I'm in pain, goddamn it!

514
00:44:33,071 --> 00:44:39,077
Cover your face. And whatever
you do, keep your eyes closed.

515
00:44:43,081 --> 00:44:48,619
Cover your face. And whatever
you do, keep your eyes closed.

516
00:44:48,653 --> 00:44:49,587
Don't move.

517
00:44:59,264 --> 00:45:00,498
Hands on the desk.

518
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:03,769
Spread 'em.

519
00:45:04,269 --> 00:45:05,070
(Grunts) What are
you doing, man?

520
00:45:05,103 --> 00:45:06,037
I didn't do
anything wrong.

521
00:45:08,106 --> 00:45:09,674
What the fuck!

522
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:12,510
We can play nice or
we can play rough.

523
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:13,845
Huh!

524
00:45:14,379 --> 00:45:15,280
Oh, you're strong!

525
00:45:15,981 --> 00:45:17,682
Oh, that' feels good.

526
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:20,151
I'm gonna fucking take you
right on my fucking desk!

527
00:45:21,286 --> 00:45:23,488
[Radio]: Team Captain -
Johnson, what's your 20?

528
00:45:23,521 --> 00:45:25,791
I'm in my office. What?

529
00:45:26,792 --> 00:45:28,693
I'm just letting you know
that the Captain's coming

530
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:31,696
Down personally, to see you
about the upset at Coco.

531
00:45:33,131 --> 00:45:34,065
Fuck!

532
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:35,767
Come here!

533
00:45:35,801 --> 00:45:36,634
Ugh!

534
00:45:37,869 --> 00:45:39,670
We will do this
again, trust me!

535
00:45:39,704 --> 00:45:41,506
Trust me!

536
00:45:41,539 --> 00:45:42,841
We will do this again.

537
00:45:42,874 --> 00:45:45,043
Trust me!

538
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:46,244
[Echoing] We will do
this again. Trust me!

539
00:45:57,856 --> 00:46:01,827
Hi. Kay-Kay said you can
use these for free.

540
00:46:06,231 --> 00:46:07,765
You need to
cut your hair.

541
00:46:08,934 --> 00:46:11,669
I don't want to
cut my hair.

542
00:46:12,237 --> 00:46:13,371
Yes, you do.

543
00:46:13,905 --> 00:46:16,741
Only girls wear
hair in here, silly.

544
00:46:19,344 --> 00:46:20,912
There are no
girls in here.

00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:34,605
Let's just keep
things simple, shall we?

725
00:59:36,607 --> 00:59:37,775
Sign these papers.

726
00:59:38,475 --> 00:59:40,077
What are they?

727
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:41,111
That's a petition
for your divorce

728
00:59:41,145 --> 00:59:42,546
And a quitclaim deed
for the house.

729
00:59:46,516 --> 00:59:47,618
Stay away from my wife.

730
00:59:48,552 --> 00:59:50,020
She's not your
wife anymore, Ray.

731
00:59:50,721 --> 00:59:52,189
She's fucking me now.

732
00:59:53,323 --> 00:59:54,558
You stupid piece of shit.

733
00:59:55,325 --> 00:59:56,761
She doesn't care about you.

734
00:59:56,794 --> 00:59:58,528
All she wants is
my fucking money.

735
00:59:59,296 --> 01:00:01,632
Yeah, and I wanna
fucking give it to her.

736
01:00:02,366 --> 01:00:03,167
Think again.

737
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,002
Okay, okay.

738
01:00:05,035 --> 01:00:06,503
How about this?

739
01:00:06,536 --> 01:00:10,374
If you don't sign the papers,
she'll witness you murder Ian.

740
01:00:10,407 --> 01:00:11,976
If you do sign
the papers,

741
01:00:12,009 --> 01:00:13,477
She'll witness a
complete accident.

742
01:00:14,544 --> 01:00:15,680
You choose.

743
01:00:16,213 --> 01:00:17,014
An accident?

744
01:00:18,548 --> 01:00:20,685
The bitch is trying to
blackmail me and you know it.

745
01:00:20,718 --> 01:00:22,486
Do I? Whoah! Ray, Ray.

746
01:00:22,753 --> 01:00:23,688
I wasn't even there.

747
01:00:26,256 --> 01:00:27,324
[Sighs]

748
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:32,697
Come on. Wise up, Ray.

749
01:00:33,731 --> 01:00:34,598
You're not in control anymore.

750
01:00:35,499 --> 01:00:37,067
You haven't been
for a long time.

751
01:00:37,101 --> 01:00:39,536
And you wanna go home,
sign the fucking papers.

752
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:41,238
No bullshit.

753
01:00:57,121 --> 01:01:01,225
By the way, uh, Tia put
$30, 000 on your books.

754
01:01:01,258 --> 01:01:02,626
She said she's
taking everything else.

755
01:01:06,030 --> 01:01:07,732
Oh, except she
don't want your car.

756
01:01:07,765 --> 01:01:09,466
She said it
smelled like you.

757
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,202
[Chuckles]

758
01:01:14,638 --> 01:01:15,672
We got a deal.

759
01:01:15,706 --> 01:01:16,874
Great!

760
01:01:16,907 --> 01:01:19,243
He'll be released
sometime tomorrow.

761
01:02:05,189 --> 01:02:06,123
What are you doing?!

762
01:02:06,423 --> 01:02:07,491
I'm shutting
down your business.

763
01:02:08,258 --> 01:02:09,559
What the hell?

764
01:02:09,593 --> 01:02:11,762
What's wrong with you man,
you know better than this.

765
01:02:11,796 --> 01:02:12,662
Don't you talk
to me like that.

766
01:02:12,696 --> 01:02:14,999
I'm sick and tired
of your disrespect.

767
01:02:15,032 --> 01:02:17,101
I run this office, not you.

768
01:02:17,802 --> 01:02:19,169
You don't run shit, man.

769
01:02:19,203 --> 01:02:21,305
And I am tired of
you in my face man,

770
01:02:21,338 --> 01:02:22,840
Every time I try
to make a move.

771
01:02:22,873 --> 01:02:24,341
That's too bad.

772
01:02:24,374 --> 01:02:27,845
From now on I get my share
plus 10% of all of your folds.

773
01:02:27,878 --> 01:02:29,980
You've been a real Jew when
it comes to distribution.

774
01:02:30,014 --> 01:02:32,382
But, that's all gonna change
now that I'm taking over.

775
01:02:33,818 --> 01:02:35,252
Now, what did you say?

776
01:02:35,285 --> 01:02:37,154
I said, "You're a
little fucking snitch!"

777
01:02:37,187 --> 01:02:38,422
I saved your life.

778
01:02:38,455 --> 01:02:39,824
You wouldn't survive an
hour out on the line.

779
01:02:39,857 --> 01:02:41,291
I saved your life!

780
01:02:41,325 --> 01:02:43,861
Go fuck yourself!

781
01:02:43,894 --> 01:02:45,195
Go fuck myself?

782
01:02:45,229 --> 01:02:47,798
I think you know it
doesn't work that way.

783
01:02:49,299 --> 01:02:50,835
Take down your pants, bitch.

784
01:02:50,868 --> 01:02:52,803
No way man, never again.

785
01:02:53,237 --> 01:02:54,171
Do it.

786
01:02:58,708 --> 01:03:00,377
You're dead!

787
01:03:03,981 --> 01:03:05,749
Prisoner Shapiro
is declassified!

788
01:03:06,683 --> 01:03:08,685
No! No! No!

789
01:03:08,718 --> 01:03:09,820
Open the door!

790
01:03:10,888 --> 01:03:11,655
You're dead!

791
01:03:12,589 --> 01:03:13,523
You're dead!

792
01:03:15,592 --> 01:03:16,260
You motherfucker!

793
01:03:16,861 --> 01:03:18,662
Open the fucking door!

794
01:03:37,547 --> 01:03:40,117
My mind is evil. I can't
resist. I can't resist.

795
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:44,855
I can't resist...

796
01:03:46,891 --> 01:03:48,926
I can't resist...

797
01:03:52,796 --> 01:03:53,797
I got some good news.

798
01:03:54,464 --> 01:03:55,765
I'm making some
changes around here.

799
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:59,469
Ben got himself declassified,
so you get to be my new bitch.

800
01:04:00,637 --> 01:04:02,272
Kill yourself!

801
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:04,841
You're facing a murder beef.

802
01:04:04,875 --> 01:04:07,912
I think we're gonna be seeing
each other for a long time.

803
01:04:12,449 --> 01:04:14,251
I'm gonna have you every day.

804
01:04:26,964 --> 01:04:28,598
Well?

805
01:04:28,632 --> 01:04:30,134
Ben's fucking gone.

806
01:04:30,901 --> 01:04:33,803
There's no more dope
and there's no more cash.

807
01:04:33,837 --> 01:04:35,439
We are so fucked.

808
01:04:37,774 --> 01:04:39,176
Any ideas?

809
01:04:58,862 --> 01:04:59,930
I have an idea.

810
01:05:06,836 --> 01:05:09,506
What do you say we
play, "Let's make a deal?"

811
01:05:12,943 --> 01:05:13,978
I don't know.

812
01:05:14,811 --> 01:05:15,845
What do you have in mind?

813
01:05:17,114 --> 01:05:18,548
I have Ben's job now.

814
01:05:19,984 --> 01:05:20,884
And a shitload of cash.

815
01:05:22,119 --> 01:05:23,387
You wanna play now?

816
01:05:25,855 --> 01:05:26,890
Hmm.

817
01:05:28,525 --> 01:05:31,228
So if you can pull it off,
we both get what we want.

818
01:05:32,029 --> 01:05:34,298
I have to admit, Junior.

819
01:05:35,966 --> 01:05:37,734
It's a good fucking idea.

820
01:05:46,510 --> 01:05:47,177
Okay.

821
01:05:48,878 --> 01:05:49,713
Okay.

822
01:05:56,353 --> 01:05:59,656
My mind is evil as it twists.

823
01:06:02,326 --> 01:06:05,262
My mind is evil as it twists.

824
01:06:06,596 --> 01:06:09,399
My mind is evil...

825
01:06:11,035 --> 01:06:12,002
I can't resist...

826
01:06:12,436 --> 01:06:13,370
I can't resist...

827
01:06:14,004 --> 01:06:15,005
I can't resist...

828
01:06:18,042 --> 01:06:19,109
Oh, yeah. This is
some good shit.

829
01:06:23,213 --> 01:06:26,950
Oh, yeah Mrs. Detroit.

830
01:06:28,452 --> 01:06:31,021
I know you was gonna
come around to Big Daddy.

831
01:06:32,122 --> 01:06:33,757
I'm fucked up...

832
01:06:35,225 --> 01:06:36,593
Now, it's my turn.

833
01:06:45,235 --> 01:06:46,270
I'm fucked up.

834
01:06:49,873 --> 01:06:51,275
Shh. Close your eyes.

835
01:06:52,709 --> 01:06:53,710
Just relax.

836
01:06:57,647 --> 01:06:59,916
Butterfly is going
to take care of you.

837
01:07:00,884 --> 01:07:01,785
Mmm. [Laughs]

838
01:07:09,626 --> 01:07:11,261
Perching...

839
01:07:14,931 --> 01:07:16,300
Beating...

840
01:07:18,602 --> 01:07:20,437
Humming...

841
01:07:22,139 --> 01:07:24,974
Just cause Daddy has it coming.

842
01:07:26,276 --> 01:07:27,977
Give it to me, baby.

843
01:07:42,192 --> 01:07:44,594
[Panting] I hate you...

844
01:07:56,673 --> 01:07:58,775
You're going to try with
all your might.

845
01:08:04,114 --> 01:08:07,050
I see you drowning
in despair.

846
01:08:15,192 --> 01:08:17,227
You play rough,
Butterfly.

847
01:08:18,495 --> 01:08:20,397
You'll find that I
don't play fair.

848
01:08:36,213 --> 01:08:37,214
Hey, hey, hey.

849
01:08:37,981 --> 01:08:39,048
Hey, hey.

850
01:08:39,683 --> 01:08:41,151
Do you have any
blood on you?

851
01:08:44,821 --> 01:08:45,422
No.

852
01:08:46,523 --> 01:08:47,724
I was careful.

853
01:08:53,863 --> 01:08:55,532
It's okay, it's
okay, it's okay.

854
01:09:02,272 --> 01:09:04,174
Shh. Shh, shh.

855
01:09:22,692 --> 01:09:25,229
Knock it off. Take a deep
breath and calm down.

856
01:09:26,129 --> 01:09:28,632
Hey, go sit on the back
wall and don't talk to anyone.

857
01:09:29,399 --> 01:09:30,367
Do you understand?

858
01:09:46,115 --> 01:09:47,317
You got balls, girl.

859
01:09:49,219 --> 01:09:52,722
We'll cover your ass,
nobody's saying nothing.

860
01:10:00,630 --> 01:10:02,632
Your boy Detroit's
got quite a record.

861
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:06,069
Six convictions for
child molestation,

862
01:10:07,271 --> 01:10:10,173
Two rape convictions,
drug abuse,

863
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:12,709
Ah hell.

864
01:10:12,742 --> 01:10:15,078
He wouldn't have survived the
mainland up in Fulsom, anyway.

865
01:10:16,112 --> 01:10:17,247
No family, no next of kin.

866
01:10:18,282 --> 01:10:20,784
They ain't gonna find
no knife, are they?

867
01:10:23,119 --> 01:10:25,589
It's about time
somebody did something.

868
01:10:26,623 --> 01:10:28,792
This guy was just
waiting for sentencing.

869
01:10:28,825 --> 01:10:30,760
Johnson, what was
he up to in here?

870
01:10:30,794 --> 01:10:31,995
Nothing I know of.

871
01:10:32,028 --> 01:10:34,864
They all try to stay
clear of him, huh?

872
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:38,268
Nothing sir, no
weapons of any kind.

873
01:10:39,303 --> 01:10:40,136
Thank you.

874
01:10:42,339 --> 01:10:44,007
Well, somebody in
here killed him.

875
01:10:45,809 --> 01:10:48,312
Homicide will be back out here
tomorrow for more questioning.

876
01:10:50,314 --> 01:10:53,149
But I tell you, I'm not
gonna change up my program

877
01:10:53,182 --> 01:10:54,684
For that pile of shit.

878
01:10:54,718 --> 01:10:57,153
Resume normal activity
until further notice.

879
01:10:57,186 --> 01:10:57,821
Concur.

880
01:10:59,956 --> 01:11:02,125
[Humming]

881
01:11:24,481 --> 01:11:27,884
Goddamn it! [Sighs]

882
01:11:45,935 --> 01:11:50,640
You know, the Lord works
in mysterious ways

883
01:11:50,674 --> 01:11:53,242
And I ain't one
to question him.

884
01:11:53,276 --> 01:11:58,748
But what I do know is,
ever since you got here

885
01:11:58,782 --> 01:12:00,216
Things ain't
been the same.

886
01:12:03,353 --> 01:12:05,522
[Guard]: Saxx, Raymond Jr.
Roll it up for release.

887
01:12:19,703 --> 01:12:21,204
You really are
straight, aren't you?

888
01:12:21,638 --> 01:12:23,339
Yes, honey. I am.

889
01:12:23,373 --> 01:12:26,342
And you've been straight with
me all along, haven't you?

890
01:12:26,376 --> 01:12:27,310
Yes, I have.

891
01:12:29,145 --> 01:12:30,947
So, we have a deal?

892
01:12:32,416 --> 01:12:33,550
Now it's all on you,
baby. Make it happen.

893
01:12:35,619 --> 01:12:36,453
Mm.

894
01:12:43,326 --> 01:12:44,761
You can count on it.

895
01:12:53,637 --> 01:12:54,438
Hey!

896
01:13:00,477 --> 01:13:02,111
Lifesaver.

897
01:13:53,463 --> 01:13:54,163
Call me!

898
01:13:58,201 --> 01:13:59,302
It's his phone number!

899
01:14:01,004 --> 01:14:02,539
There goes a real gangster.

900
01:14:05,542 --> 01:14:07,310
You should be taking notes.

901
01:14:09,045 --> 01:14:13,149
Saxx? Saxx!

902
01:14:13,182 --> 01:14:14,217
Face the wall.

903
01:14:14,818 --> 01:14:17,521
This is my dorm.
I'll take it from here.

904
01:14:17,554 --> 01:14:19,489
Jerome, Captain Davis called
and said he don't want you

905
01:14:19,523 --> 01:14:23,560
Going nowhere until this
dorm is back up and running.

906
01:14:23,593 --> 01:14:24,360
Face the wall!

907
01:14:24,393 --> 01:14:27,363
When?! When did
he call?!

908
01:14:27,396 --> 01:14:29,398
When did he say that?!

909
01:14:32,335 --> 01:14:33,503
I'll be waiting, Saxx.

910
01:14:34,604 --> 01:14:35,739
Everybody comes back.

911
01:14:36,606 --> 01:14:38,107
Everybody comes back!

912
01:14:39,042 --> 01:14:40,409
Saxx! Do you hear me?

913
01:14:40,443 --> 01:14:41,778
I'll see you again!

914
01:15:21,618 --> 01:15:23,086
You know how
scandalous I can be.

915
01:15:23,887 --> 01:15:25,388
And I ain't afraid of no pig.

916
01:15:59,589 --> 01:16:00,590
Yes?

917
01:16:01,625 --> 01:16:02,525
May I come in?

918
01:16:27,784 --> 01:16:29,318
You're the only man
I got left in here.

919
01:16:30,353 --> 01:16:31,621
Are you
mad at me?

920
01:16:33,256 --> 01:16:34,090
A little bit.

921
01:16:34,924 --> 01:16:36,793
You got rid of
the competition.

922
01:16:37,526 --> 01:16:39,295
Now, we're
all alone!

923
01:16:39,528 --> 01:16:41,097
I can't believe
you're really here.

924
01:16:43,933 --> 01:16:45,001
Why not?

925
01:16:45,835 --> 01:16:48,171
Ben's gone,
Ray's gone.

926
01:16:49,438 --> 01:16:50,640
Who's gonna run this
place with you, huh?

927
01:16:52,108 --> 01:16:54,744
What? Well, now you know
they earned their position.

928
01:16:54,778 --> 01:16:55,812
Yeah?

929
01:16:55,845 --> 01:16:58,514
Well, I have no
problem with that.

930
01:16:59,315 --> 01:17:02,451
I'm a working
girl, you know this.

931
01:17:04,721 --> 01:17:05,655
Oh my god!

932
01:17:06,355 --> 01:17:07,523
I've waited so
long for this.

933
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:11,560
Oh my god.

934
01:17:17,533 --> 01:17:21,470
You taste so good,
just like a real woman.

935
01:17:23,740 --> 01:17:27,911
Hold on. You wanna take
my breath away, Papi?

936
01:17:29,813 --> 01:17:31,781
Ben didn't know
how to get down.

937
01:17:31,815 --> 01:17:33,049
He was from
the West Side.

938
01:17:33,750 --> 01:17:35,384
No. I...

939
01:17:36,552 --> 01:17:38,521
No, honey. This
ain't no honeymoon.

940
01:17:43,326 --> 01:17:45,862
I want a jailhouse
fuck, and I want it now!

941
01:17:54,838 --> 01:17:55,839
Harder!

942
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:57,406
I said harder!

943
01:17:57,440 --> 01:17:58,341
I'll give it to
you harder.

944
01:18:00,910 --> 01:18:05,248
You take it, you take
it, you do what I say.

945
01:18:05,281 --> 01:18:08,284
I'll fuck you, I'm
gonna make you bleed!

946
01:18:09,118 --> 01:18:10,186
I'm gonna make
you fucking bleed!

947
01:18:10,887 --> 01:18:12,555
Tell me what to do, I'm
gonna make you bleed.

948
01:18:13,222 --> 01:18:14,223
Stop it!

949
01:18:14,590 --> 01:18:15,591
Stop it!

950
01:18:16,125 --> 01:18:17,560
Stop that, what the...

951
01:18:17,593 --> 01:18:20,696
I'm gonna split your
ass, you fucking cunt!

952
01:18:21,297 --> 01:18:22,465
I'm gonna fuck you...

953
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:26,269
Don't make me hit you,
I'll choke you out,

954
01:18:26,302 --> 01:18:27,937
You little fuckin' Medina.
Stop it, please! Stop it!

955
01:18:27,971 --> 01:18:29,605
Oh hell no, this
shit ends right now.

956
01:18:30,974 --> 01:18:32,475
Hey, do you hear this?

957
01:18:33,777 --> 01:18:35,244
Do something!

958
01:18:35,278 --> 01:18:35,945
Now!

959
01:18:38,247 --> 01:18:39,883
I don't want it...

960
01:18:40,449 --> 01:18:41,450
Don't you tell
me what, shut up.

961
01:18:41,484 --> 01:18:42,919
You shut up!

962
01:18:42,952 --> 01:18:44,120
You shut up!

963
01:18:44,153 --> 01:18:45,321
Stop!

964
01:18:50,827 --> 01:18:52,161
She was, she was...

965
01:18:53,496 --> 01:18:54,630
We...

966
01:19:16,685 --> 01:19:18,454
Someone really loves you.

967
01:19:19,655 --> 01:19:20,790
Not anymore.

968
01:19:26,963 --> 01:19:28,097
I'd like to put
some of this money

969
01:19:28,131 --> 01:19:29,132
On another
inmate's account.

970
01:19:30,633 --> 01:19:32,135
On a scale of 1 to 10, how
would you describe your pain?

971
01:19:34,137 --> 01:19:35,204
Well, it comes in waves.

972
01:19:36,873 --> 01:19:38,341
But, definitely a 10.

973
01:19:39,475 --> 01:19:40,443
I would never hurt you!

974
01:19:41,177 --> 01:19:42,111
You seduced me!

975
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:43,446
You seduced me!

976
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:45,614
You said you wanted a
jailhouse fuck, remember?

977
01:19:46,682 --> 01:19:47,884
You said you wanted
a jailhouse fuck!

978
01:19:48,717 --> 01:19:50,686
He raped me and then
he tried to kill me.

979
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:52,288
No!

980
01:19:52,788 --> 01:19:53,622
That, that is so
wrong. It's bullshit!

981
01:19:55,524 --> 01:19:56,125
You tried to hang
me with your belt!

982
01:19:56,792 --> 01:19:57,961
You told me to!

983
01:19:57,994 --> 01:19:58,995
No!
You told me to!

984
01:19:59,896 --> 01:20:00,763
Look at my neck!

985
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:02,631
It's red and blue!

986
01:20:03,566 --> 01:20:04,700
Alright, alright!

987
01:20:05,001 --> 01:20:05,969
I'm a lady, goddamn it!

988
01:20:06,202 --> 01:20:07,203
That's enough.

989
01:20:07,837 --> 01:20:09,305
Mr. Ruiz, are you
gonna press charges?

990
01:20:12,208 --> 01:20:13,142
Absolutely.

991
01:20:13,176 --> 01:20:14,177
For what?

992
01:20:15,578 --> 01:20:17,881
Well, you really came out
of the closet on this one.

993
01:20:18,882 --> 01:20:20,483
A murder in the
dorm, and now rape?

994
01:20:21,084 --> 01:20:22,351
No!

995
01:20:22,886 --> 01:20:24,921
I can't ignore your actions
any longer, Gerald.

996
01:20:25,889 --> 01:20:28,524
Lt. Villalobos, cuff him.

997
01:20:29,058 --> 01:20:30,759
Book him with rape and
suspicion of murder.

998
01:20:31,394 --> 01:20:32,695
Then dump his
ass in the hole.

999
01:20:32,728 --> 01:20:33,696
We'll deal with
him later!

1000
01:20:33,729 --> 01:20:34,864
But this is outrageous!

1001
01:20:35,198 --> 01:20:36,199
You can't...

1002
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:38,734
Now on your feet, face the
wall, hands behind your back.

1003
01:20:38,767 --> 01:20:39,468
Get them behind your back.

1004
01:20:39,502 --> 01:20:42,505
I didn't!
She's lying!

1005
01:20:46,775 --> 01:20:48,844
This is outrageous!
Liar!

1006
01:20:48,878 --> 01:20:49,678
It's not right!
It's not right!

1007
01:20:51,047 --> 01:20:52,715
I gotta get out of
here before I get sick.

1008
01:20:54,250 --> 01:20:57,853
Theresa, I wouldn't object
to put you in charge here.

1009
01:20:58,554 --> 01:20:59,855
Are you up for that promotion?

1010
01:21:00,756 --> 01:21:01,790
Yes, sir.

1011
01:21:02,892 --> 01:21:03,893
Good.

1012
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:05,962
I want a report on my
desk tomorrow morning.

1013
01:21:08,197 --> 01:21:08,864
Hernandez, let's go.

1014
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:12,035
Oh, thank you.

1015
01:21:13,402 --> 01:21:14,403
You're ready to go
home, sweetheart?

1016
01:21:16,105 --> 01:21:21,410
Well, I would like to call
my Mom first if that's okay.

1017
01:21:22,378 --> 01:21:26,082
Okay, honey. I'll be
waiting for you outside.

1018
01:21:26,115 --> 01:21:29,618
Oh, uh, I'm gonna
be needing a clerk.

1019
01:21:30,086 --> 01:21:31,654
Are you interested?

1020
01:21:33,422 --> 01:21:34,323
Yeah.

1021
01:21:35,992 --> 01:21:38,261
All right,
five minutes.

1022
01:22:15,531 --> 01:22:16,532
Hello?

1023
01:22:16,932 --> 01:22:17,766
Ola, Junior.

1024
01:22:19,969 --> 01:22:20,636
Where are you?

1025
01:22:21,470 --> 01:22:22,038
I just stepped
outside.

1026
01:22:30,046 --> 01:22:31,714
Wave at me, I'm
watching you.

1027
01:22:39,822 --> 01:22:41,357
So, um, Johnson's in the hole.

1028
01:22:43,459 --> 01:22:46,329
Um, Davis charged him with
rape and Detroit's murder.

1029
01:22:48,131 --> 01:22:50,366
He was so scared when
they dragged him away.

1030
01:22:54,037 --> 01:22:55,671
I bet he -he's crying
like a bitch right now.

1031
01:22:56,672 --> 01:22:57,673
Fuck, yeah!

1032
01:22:59,175 --> 01:23:00,343
Listen, Huerto.

1033
01:23:00,909 --> 01:23:04,247
You got your revenge, I
want my fucking money.

1034
01:23:05,381 --> 01:23:07,083
Check your
fucking books, okay?

1035
01:23:09,918 --> 01:23:10,819
Open 11!

1036
01:23:12,088 --> 01:23:12,888
Opening 11!

1037
01:23:14,057 --> 01:23:14,923
Here's your cell.

1038
01:23:17,926 --> 01:23:18,894
Get me the hell out of here!

1039
01:23:19,728 --> 01:23:20,329
No!

1040
01:23:20,896 --> 01:23:22,365
Don't move, Gerald.

1041
01:23:23,232 --> 01:23:24,567
Just save your
strength, asshole.

1042
01:23:25,068 --> 01:23:27,536
Trust me. You're
gonna need it.

1043
01:23:27,570 --> 01:23:28,237
On your feet.

1044
01:23:28,937 --> 01:23:30,539
Come on. Get up!

1045
01:23:30,573 --> 01:23:31,174
Get in!

1046
01:23:33,076 --> 01:23:33,842
Close 11!

1047
01:23:34,443 --> 01:23:35,111
Closing 11!

1048
01:23:42,551 --> 01:23:43,786
No, wait!

1049
01:23:49,058 --> 01:23:50,926
Payback's a
bitch, hey Johnson?

1050
01:23:50,959 --> 01:23:51,894
No, no, I can't...

1051
01:23:53,028 --> 01:23:53,896
Hello, Washington?

1052
01:23:54,563 --> 01:23:55,631
It's good to see you.

1053
01:23:56,031 --> 01:23:56,965
It's nice to see you too, sir.

1054
01:24:00,103 --> 01:24:01,104
Hey, buddy.

1055
01:24:02,371 --> 01:24:03,206
Come here!

1056
01:24:04,073 --> 01:24:05,708
Hey, hey!

1057
01:24:06,942 --> 01:24:07,943
Hey, boy.

1058
01:24:11,247 --> 01:24:13,048
Do you think the
car smells like me?

1059
01:24:14,417 --> 01:24:15,451
I certainly hope not.

1060
01:24:33,068 --> 01:24:34,303
Where to? Tommy's?

1061
01:24:34,337 --> 01:24:36,105
I'll let you buy
me a burger.

1062
01:24:52,255 --> 01:24:54,123
I love you, Huerto!
