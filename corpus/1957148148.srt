1
00:00:23,414 --> 00:00:25,373
It's okay. You're gonna be okay.

2
00:01:05,456 --> 00:01:06,675
What're you gonna do to me?

3
00:01:09,286 --> 00:01:11,636
Maggie, I didn't let you
and your sister escape

4
00:01:11,723 --> 00:01:13,029
to find you out here in this.

5
00:01:13,116 --> 00:01:14,335
We're just trying
to help, Jimmy.

6
00:01:14,422 --> 00:01:16,554
You gotta get outta here.
There's a war...

7
00:01:28,914 --> 00:01:31,091
What's gotten into you?

8
00:01:31,178 --> 00:01:32,396
That wasn't me.

9
00:01:46,889 --> 00:01:47,890
Ah. Oh, my God.

10
00:01:47,977 --> 00:01:49,674
Maggie, go. Go, run!

11
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,254
Maggie.

12
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,605
Maggie!

13
00:03:06,882 --> 00:03:08,449
Big line of thunderstorms

14
00:03:08,536 --> 00:03:10,320
moving into the Richmond area
from the west,

15
00:03:10,407 --> 00:03:12,757
going to have a lot of
lightning associated with it.

16
00:03:12,844 --> 00:03:15,064
Good news is, it should be
cleared out by morning.

17
00:03:15,151 --> 00:03:17,066
We'â€™II have a little more on
your seven day forecast coming up.

18
00:03:17,153 --> 00:03:18,328
It's back to you, Linda.

19
00:03:18,415 --> 00:03:19,764
Thanks, Billy.

20
00:03:19,851 --> 00:03:22,158
Now more on our
developing story...

21
00:03:22,245 --> 00:03:23,377
"Dear, Alan Jones...

22
00:03:24,595 --> 00:03:27,903
"Civil War...
Solomon Jones...

23
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,165
"Lost his left arm..."

24
00:03:29,687 --> 00:03:30,862
Cool.

25
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:32,124
Thanks, Linda.

26
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,952
Another strange incident
tonight

27
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:36,607
as more graves have been robbed
at Gracelawn Cemetery.

28
00:03:36,694 --> 00:03:38,696
Surveillance video shows
what appears to be

29
00:03:38,783 --> 00:03:41,090
a grave robber
escaping from the scene.

30
00:03:41,177 --> 00:03:43,048
And just like before,
the alleged suspect

31
00:03:43,135 --> 00:03:45,312
took only certain body parts
from his victims

32
00:03:45,399 --> 00:03:48,706
who were supposed to be
resting in peace.

33
00:03:50,012 --> 00:03:51,100
Thanks, Audrey.

34
00:03:51,187 --> 00:03:52,362
Coming up in sports...

35
00:04:02,807 --> 00:04:03,808
It's open.

36
00:04:05,332 --> 00:04:07,464
Oh. Alan.

37
00:04:07,551 --> 00:04:08,551
Miss Henderson.

38
00:04:09,727 --> 00:04:11,251
Kind of expecting
someone else tonight.

39
00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:15,298
Nice ring you have there.

40
00:04:15,385 --> 00:04:16,995
Thanks. Good night.

41
00:04:20,477 --> 00:04:22,087
Okay.

42
00:04:22,174 --> 00:04:25,308
You know, Alan, if you
can't afford to pay the rent,

43
00:04:25,395 --> 00:04:27,528
I'm sure we can
work something out.

44
00:04:27,615 --> 00:04:28,615
No, thank you.

45
00:04:31,793 --> 00:04:34,839
You're three months late.
Now I understand why.

46
00:04:34,926 --> 00:04:36,798
You bought that ring
for your slut.

47
00:04:36,885 --> 00:04:38,365
What?

48
00:04:38,452 --> 00:04:40,497
You wouldn't know, would you?

49
00:04:40,584 --> 00:04:42,760
I saw her kissing
Mr. Mustache Man

50
00:04:42,847 --> 00:04:44,371
at the grocery store.

51
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:45,458
Eugene?

52
00:04:46,503 --> 00:04:48,026
I don't think so.

53
00:04:48,113 --> 00:04:50,377
Well, yeah, I do think so.

54
00:04:50,464 --> 00:04:51,856
Okay, you're leaving.

55
00:04:51,943 --> 00:04:53,597
Thanks for stopping by.

56
00:04:53,684 --> 00:04:55,730
I'll be sure to get you your
money as soon as possible, okay?

57
00:04:55,817 --> 00:04:57,035
-The money by tomorrow.
-Okay.

58
00:04:57,122 --> 00:04:58,298
-No more chances.
-Okay.

59
00:04:58,385 --> 00:05:00,387
I will throw you out
on your hot ass.

60
00:05:00,474 --> 00:05:01,605
Okay, good night.

61
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:04,826
Or you can give me the ring.

62
00:05:04,913 --> 00:05:06,480
Let me see that.

63
00:05:06,567 --> 00:05:08,003
Is this real?

64
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,090
Are those real?

65
00:05:10,222 --> 00:05:11,833
Wanna find out?

66
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,921
Good night.

67
00:05:19,101 --> 00:05:20,972
The money or the ring
by tomorrow.

68
00:06:00,577 --> 00:06:01,883
Hey, old man.

69
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,232
Better get inside.
It's about to rain.

70
00:06:34,219 --> 00:06:37,048
Excuse me, young man, would you
read this card for me, please?

71
00:06:40,138 --> 00:06:41,575
-Sure.
-Thank you.

72
00:06:47,842 --> 00:06:48,843
Well...

73
00:06:50,366 --> 00:06:51,498
It says,

74
00:06:51,585 --> 00:06:52,629
"Dear, Ashley,

75
00:06:54,152 --> 00:06:55,545
"I've been such a...

76
00:07:00,071 --> 00:07:01,464
"Will you marry me?"

77
00:07:01,551 --> 00:07:02,900
That isn't what it says.

78
00:07:04,902 --> 00:07:06,991
Oh, um, no.

79
00:07:07,078 --> 00:07:08,558
It says,

80
00:07:08,645 --> 00:07:10,430
"You're exactly what
I've been looking for."

81
00:07:10,517 --> 00:07:11,517
Yes.

82
00:07:14,738 --> 00:07:16,131
You are.

83
00:07:19,787 --> 00:07:21,484
-What?
-You are going to

84
00:07:21,571 --> 00:07:23,965
have to work on
your proposal to Ashley.

85
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,708
You're welcome.

86
00:07:35,803 --> 00:07:38,458
Hey, I got Aisle 7 done.
Can I go?

87
00:07:38,545 --> 00:07:40,503
What's the rush, Ashley?

88
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:41,678
Come on in.

89
00:07:41,765 --> 00:07:42,810
Shut the door.

90
00:07:46,117 --> 00:07:47,292
I have a question for you.

91
00:07:48,685 --> 00:07:49,685
Want a cake?

92
00:07:51,253 --> 00:07:52,341
No, I'm good, thanks.

93
00:07:52,428 --> 00:07:54,125
What?

94
00:07:54,212 --> 00:07:57,259
Don't you want some of this
100 percent Grade A Eugene?

95
00:07:57,346 --> 00:07:58,826
-You're sick.
-Ashley.

96
00:07:58,913 --> 00:08:01,698
Ugh, please stop. I told you
I am not into you.

97
00:08:01,785 --> 00:08:03,134
Just a little kiss.

98
00:08:08,531 --> 00:08:10,141
Hey, Alan.

99
00:08:10,228 --> 00:08:11,578
Hey, uh, where's Ashley?

100
00:08:11,665 --> 00:08:13,493
-She's in the back.
-Thanks, man.

101
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:16,539
You can't go back there.
You don't work here anymore.

102
00:08:31,423 --> 00:08:33,034
I knew you had a thing
for me, Ashley.

103
00:08:38,996 --> 00:08:40,520
Ashley!

104
00:08:40,607 --> 00:08:41,869
Thought I fired that guy.

105
00:08:41,956 --> 00:08:42,956
Alan, wait.

106
00:08:45,002 --> 00:08:46,526
I was gonna give you a raise.

107
00:08:56,797 --> 00:08:59,364
I'm sorry, Alan.
Eugene forced me to kiss him.

108
00:08:59,451 --> 00:09:01,889
Did he force you to kiss him
the other day, too?

109
00:09:01,976 --> 00:09:03,412
How do you know about that?

110
00:09:03,499 --> 00:09:05,153
My landlord saw you.

111
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,025
Uh, she called you a slut.

112
00:09:08,112 --> 00:09:10,332
Alan, please just trust me.

113
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:23,693
Why don't you believe me, Alan?

114
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,739
You know I love you.

115
00:09:25,826 --> 00:09:27,044
That'll be $3.43.

116
00:09:28,176 --> 00:09:29,438
Aren't you gonna say anything?

117
00:09:30,874 --> 00:09:32,267
Do you have five bucks
I can borrow?

118
00:09:33,834 --> 00:09:34,834
Sure.

119
00:09:39,796 --> 00:09:41,581
Thanks. There you go.

120
00:09:41,668 --> 00:09:44,061
I don't have to
pay you back, do I?

121
00:09:44,148 --> 00:09:45,323
Yes!

122
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:46,411
Ugh!

123
00:09:47,238 --> 00:09:48,283
Just keep it.

124
00:09:50,415 --> 00:09:52,287
Hey, congratulations.

125
00:09:52,374 --> 00:09:53,593
She said "yes."

126
00:10:44,382 --> 00:10:45,732
Hey, man, you got some change?

127
00:10:47,037 --> 00:10:49,170
Funny story.
Actually, I'm...

128
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:53,653
Man, all we asked for
was some change.

129
00:11:02,183 --> 00:11:03,183
All right.

130
00:11:10,844 --> 00:11:11,844
That's enough.

131
00:11:12,846 --> 00:11:14,369
Get outta here.

132
00:11:14,456 --> 00:11:15,456
What about our money?

133
00:11:17,111 --> 00:11:18,155
Check's in the mail.

134
00:11:20,201 --> 00:11:21,463
Now beat it.

135
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,770
-All right.
-God, this is bullshit.

136
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:34,694
What?

137
00:11:34,781 --> 00:11:35,781
What's this?

138
00:11:36,957 --> 00:11:38,001
Who are you?

139
00:11:38,828 --> 00:11:39,873
Good question.

140
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,406
Is the donor
prepped and ready?

141
00:12:37,582 --> 00:12:38,583
Good.

142
00:12:41,064 --> 00:12:44,111
Remember now, only 20 ccs.

143
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:49,856
That much should
kill him, right?

144
00:12:49,943 --> 00:12:51,988
No, it won't kill him.

145
00:12:53,207 --> 00:12:55,165
It'll do much worse than that.

146
00:13:05,654 --> 00:13:07,090
You sure
his vision's good?

147
00:13:07,177 --> 00:13:09,092
I checked it at
the grocery store.

148
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:10,702
Now change the bandage.

149
00:13:20,712 --> 00:13:23,454
This is the last
body part we'll need.

150
00:13:26,631 --> 00:13:30,244
You'd like to pull the switch,
wouldn't you?

151
00:13:30,331 --> 00:13:31,331
Just to see what happens?

152
00:13:32,681 --> 00:13:34,726
It's too unstable
because of the storm.

153
00:13:36,728 --> 00:13:37,728
Life and death.

154
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:41,864
These aren't the things
we play games with, are they?

155
00:13:41,951 --> 00:13:43,648
This is not the same machine

156
00:13:43,735 --> 00:13:46,129
that you read about
in your monster books.

157
00:13:46,216 --> 00:13:48,958
A power surge during
this procedure would be...

158
00:13:51,526 --> 00:13:52,526
unpredictable.

159
00:13:53,441 --> 00:13:55,182
So, we do not pull that switch

160
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:57,010
until I say so, do we?

161
00:13:59,664 --> 00:14:01,797
Give them 20 ccs more each.

162
00:14:07,934 --> 00:14:10,284
Hate when he talks to me
like I'm a kid.

163
00:14:10,371 --> 00:14:12,416
You are a kid.

164
00:14:12,503 --> 00:14:13,591
Kid.

165
00:14:13,678 --> 00:14:14,679
Shut up.

166
00:14:17,247 --> 00:14:22,209
Tell me that that's not
a Frankenstein.

167
00:14:22,296 --> 00:14:23,645
Something like that.

168
00:14:38,965 --> 00:14:41,445
Nanobot activation initiated.

169
00:14:41,532 --> 00:14:43,708
Cellular reanimation...

170
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:53,457
Cellular reanimation
in ten seconds.

171
00:14:56,504 --> 00:14:58,158
Oh, what's going on here?

172
00:14:58,245 --> 00:15:00,856
Cellular reanimation
in five seconds.

173
00:15:00,943 --> 00:15:02,597
It's working!

174
00:15:02,684 --> 00:15:04,381
I-I did it!

175
00:15:05,861 --> 00:15:08,559
I did it.
It's working.

176
00:15:11,475 --> 00:15:12,563
He's alive.

177
00:15:15,523 --> 00:15:17,351
Yes!

178
00:15:17,438 --> 00:15:18,961
He's alive!

179
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:20,920
Warning.

180
00:15:38,154 --> 00:15:41,070
Oh, no! Oh, no!
Shut it down!

181
00:15:41,157 --> 00:15:43,290
No, this can't be happening.

182
00:15:43,377 --> 00:15:46,293
Shut it down! Shut it down!
Shut it down!

183
00:15:56,651 --> 00:15:58,261
Why are there so many of them?

184
00:15:58,348 --> 00:16:02,135
What do you mean,
"Why are there so many of them?"

185
00:16:02,222 --> 00:16:05,921
You've ruptured the multiverse,
you fool.

186
00:16:19,369 --> 00:16:21,415
-Hey.
-Hey.

187
00:16:21,502 --> 00:16:23,504
So you love me, right?

188
00:16:23,591 --> 00:16:25,027
Yeah.

189
00:16:25,114 --> 00:16:26,115
Let's get married.

190
00:16:28,726 --> 00:16:29,727
What?

191
00:16:30,467 --> 00:16:31,468
Today.

192
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,385
Um...

193
00:16:35,472 --> 00:16:37,126
Seriously, Alan,

194
00:16:37,213 --> 00:16:40,303
you're proposing to me
on my break at work

195
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:42,044
in front of a dumpster?

196
00:16:42,131 --> 00:16:43,437
You can do better than this.

197
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:46,135
Just get up.

198
00:16:47,702 --> 00:16:50,139
Just get up.

199
00:16:50,226 --> 00:16:52,794
Get up, Alan. Get up.

200
00:16:52,881 --> 00:16:54,839
Get up.

201
00:16:54,926 --> 00:16:55,927
Get up.

202
00:16:56,754 --> 00:16:57,755
Get up.

203
00:16:58,582 --> 00:17:00,062
Hey! Get up.

204
00:17:01,194 --> 00:17:02,543
Over here.

205
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,674
This one's alive.

206
00:17:06,547 --> 00:17:08,331
Where's his uniform?

207
00:17:08,418 --> 00:17:10,159
I don't think he's a soldier.

208
00:17:10,246 --> 00:17:11,421
Let's get him
to the medical tent.

209
00:17:11,508 --> 00:17:12,451
Where am I?

210
00:17:12,466 --> 00:17:14,076
Well, you're in hell, son.

211
00:17:14,163 --> 00:17:16,339
And if we're lucky, we might
just make it out alive.

212
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:20,604
Oh, damn it.

213
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:23,651
Come on.

214
00:17:25,392 --> 00:17:27,263
You better live.

215
00:17:38,927 --> 00:17:40,842
Hold on, it's gonna be okay.

216
00:17:40,929 --> 00:17:41,929
Where am I?

217
00:17:43,018 --> 00:17:44,889
Did the experiments
make it through?

218
00:17:44,976 --> 00:17:46,978
I don't know what you were doing
out here on this battlefield

219
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,545
but you are delirious.

220
00:17:48,632 --> 00:17:50,330
Just try and rest.

221
00:17:50,417 --> 00:17:53,202
I don't see any wounds.
Were you hit?

222
00:17:53,289 --> 00:17:55,248
My body is too old

223
00:17:55,335 --> 00:17:57,250
to survive the trip.

224
00:17:57,337 --> 00:17:59,600
Tell me, what year is it?

225
00:18:01,819 --> 00:18:02,994
Lay him down over there.

226
00:18:09,349 --> 00:18:10,828
Confederates took us
by surprise.

227
00:18:12,569 --> 00:18:15,181
Maggie, Maggie, what happened?

228
00:18:15,268 --> 00:18:17,270
There's something else
out there.

229
00:18:17,357 --> 00:18:18,923
Those soldiers,
they're bigger and stronger.

230
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:20,708
They're not so big.

231
00:18:20,795 --> 00:18:22,318
I took out ten
with one arm.

232
00:18:22,405 --> 00:18:23,406
Just ten?

233
00:18:23,493 --> 00:18:24,668
Well, I had to carry him.

234
00:18:24,755 --> 00:18:26,105
Lie down, Maggie, lie down.

235
00:18:26,192 --> 00:18:27,192
No, no.

236
00:18:28,803 --> 00:18:30,979
-I've to go back out there.
-Wait, Solomon, wait.

237
00:18:31,066 --> 00:18:32,285
Are you hurt?

238
00:18:32,372 --> 00:18:33,808
Virginia, I didn't know
you cared.

239
00:18:36,506 --> 00:18:39,379
I don't. Just doing my job.

240
00:18:39,466 --> 00:18:40,902
Don't lie to yourself, darlin'.

241
00:18:42,164 --> 00:18:43,600
Go away, Solomon.

242
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,423
What you got there, boy?

243
00:19:24,859 --> 00:19:27,427
-Nothing.
-I said...

244
00:19:27,514 --> 00:19:30,081
What you got behind your back?

245
00:19:33,128 --> 00:19:35,565
That don't look like
nothing to me.

246
00:19:35,652 --> 00:19:37,088
What is this?

247
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,264
You see those monsters
back there

248
00:19:38,351 --> 00:19:39,917
ripping everything apart?

249
00:19:40,004 --> 00:19:42,616
That's what made them
and maybe can destroy them.

250
00:19:42,703 --> 00:19:43,921
So give it back to me.

251
00:19:45,445 --> 00:19:46,446
No.

252
00:19:46,533 --> 00:19:49,144
I do believe I'll keep it.

253
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:51,233
Fall back, men, fall back.

254
00:20:07,641 --> 00:20:11,166
Hey, whoa.
It was just a bad dream.

255
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:12,646
It was just a bad dream.

256
00:20:12,733 --> 00:20:16,867
No, it was...
it was like I was there.

257
00:20:16,954 --> 00:20:19,261
Soldiers, bodies...

258
00:20:19,348 --> 00:20:20,784
Frankensteins.

259
00:20:20,871 --> 00:20:21,916
Oh, the kid.

260
00:20:22,003 --> 00:20:24,571
So, they are here with us.

261
00:20:24,658 --> 00:20:26,225
They...

262
00:20:26,312 --> 00:20:27,313
They must die.

263
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,792
All of them.

264
00:20:28,879 --> 00:20:30,838
What are you talking about?
Who must die?

265
00:20:30,925 --> 00:20:32,056
This

266
00:20:32,143 --> 00:20:34,624
was not supposed to happen.

267
00:20:34,711 --> 00:20:37,105
You must find them

268
00:20:37,192 --> 00:20:38,541
and destroy them.

269
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:42,241
What did you do to me, old man?

270
00:20:45,766 --> 00:20:46,810
Doctor.

271
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,380
Igor.

272
00:20:53,426 --> 00:20:54,992
You're alive.

273
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:56,777
It's the Civil War.

274
00:20:56,864 --> 00:20:58,648
Experiments are everywhere.

275
00:20:58,735 --> 00:21:01,477
-What do we do?
-Civil War?

276
00:21:01,564 --> 00:21:04,741
Oh, I'm so sorry, Igor.

277
00:21:04,828 --> 00:21:05,873
It's all my fault.

278
00:21:07,178 --> 00:21:09,659
I knew it was going to be risky.

279
00:21:09,746 --> 00:21:13,141
But I could never have
predicted anything like this.

280
00:21:15,883 --> 00:21:17,145
Kill them all.

281
00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:21,323
Fix the dimensional rift.

282
00:21:22,672 --> 00:21:24,805
And then you can go home.

283
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,272
What's wrong with him?

284
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,940
I don't know, he...

285
00:21:30,027 --> 00:21:33,117
he said something about his body
couldn't survive the trip.

286
00:21:33,204 --> 00:21:34,380
What did he mean by that?

287
00:21:36,947 --> 00:21:38,035
He meant

288
00:21:39,036 --> 00:21:40,081
the trip through time.

289
00:21:53,834 --> 00:21:56,532
I have to repair
the dimensional rift.

290
00:21:56,619 --> 00:21:57,968
Oh, yeah.

291
00:21:58,055 --> 00:22:00,014
And kill an army
of Frankensteins.

292
00:22:00,101 --> 00:22:01,276
Sounds easy enough.

293
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,065
What is a Frankenstein?

294
00:22:08,152 --> 00:22:09,980
It's not called a Frankenstein.

295
00:22:11,678 --> 00:22:13,593
It doesn't matter.

296
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,335
What matters is that we
kill them so we can go home.

297
00:22:16,422 --> 00:22:18,293
Yeah, you go right ahead...

298
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,512
but I'm staying here.

299
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:21,035
I don't wanna go home anyway.

300
00:22:21,122 --> 00:22:22,515
You're an idiot.

301
00:22:22,602 --> 00:22:24,081
Do you know anything
about surviving out here?

302
00:22:24,168 --> 00:22:25,387
Yeah, of course I do.

303
00:22:27,694 --> 00:22:29,435
Maggie, put pressure
on his wound.

304
00:22:29,522 --> 00:22:30,740
Go get a cart ready.

305
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:36,919
He's dead.

306
00:22:38,182 --> 00:22:40,359
Your best chance of survival
is sticking with me.

307
00:22:42,622 --> 00:22:43,753
Where are you all from?

308
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:55,852
We're from the future.

309
00:22:55,939 --> 00:22:58,551
And it's time to kick
some Frankenstein ass.

310
00:23:19,049 --> 00:23:20,703
Captain Walton.

311
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:22,270
Some of our men have returned.

312
00:23:24,228 --> 00:23:25,316
How many?

313
00:23:27,928 --> 00:23:28,928
Three, sir.

314
00:23:31,845 --> 00:23:33,586
I sent thirty soldiers.

315
00:23:44,553 --> 00:23:45,772
Outta my way.

316
00:23:47,295 --> 00:23:48,601
Company, halt.

317
00:23:56,696 --> 00:23:59,960
How injured are these soldiers?

318
00:24:00,047 --> 00:24:01,265
Not bad, sir.

319
00:24:01,352 --> 00:24:03,311
They just need some rest
and medicine.

320
00:24:03,398 --> 00:24:04,573
They'll be back up
on their feet.

321
00:24:06,227 --> 00:24:07,358
Shoot them.

322
00:24:09,883 --> 00:24:10,884
Sir?

323
00:24:23,853 --> 00:24:27,901
We need to conserve
our medicine, Lieutenant.

324
00:24:27,988 --> 00:24:29,076
Follow me.

325
00:24:43,003 --> 00:24:47,355
Never hesitate when I give you
an order, Lieutenant.

326
00:24:47,442 --> 00:24:49,139
That's how people end up dead.

327
00:24:50,358 --> 00:24:51,358
Yes, sir.

328
00:24:52,316 --> 00:24:54,928
We are so close
to winning this war.

329
00:24:55,015 --> 00:24:58,366
If we can take this enemy camp,

330
00:24:58,453 --> 00:25:02,588
our forces could overpower
the North once and for all.

331
00:25:02,675 --> 00:25:06,722
And all your sorry men had to do
was scout the enemy.

332
00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:09,246
I need those numbers!

333
00:25:10,726 --> 00:25:12,206
Is that too much to ask?

334
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:15,514
What the hell
happened out there?

335
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:21,389
Monsters, sir.

336
00:25:22,695 --> 00:25:23,783
Monsters.

337
00:25:24,958 --> 00:25:25,958
Monsters?

338
00:25:27,482 --> 00:25:30,180
They came outta nowhere
and they slaughtered...

339
00:25:30,267 --> 00:25:31,834
they slaughtered
the entire platoon.

340
00:25:33,488 --> 00:25:36,404
Are you lying to me, soldier?

341
00:25:36,491 --> 00:25:38,537
No. No, sir.

342
00:25:39,973 --> 00:25:41,975
Bullets do them no harm.

343
00:25:42,062 --> 00:25:43,280
They have no fear of dying.

344
00:25:44,673 --> 00:25:47,676
Do you fear dying, Lieutenant?

345
00:25:49,112 --> 00:25:50,157
Yes.

346
00:25:56,032 --> 00:25:59,035
That's not
a fair question to ask.

347
00:26:00,515 --> 00:26:03,692
We all fear dying a little bit.

348
00:26:06,303 --> 00:26:07,870
Now...

349
00:26:07,957 --> 00:26:08,958
tell me

350
00:26:09,045 --> 00:26:10,045
the truth!

351
00:26:14,485 --> 00:26:15,574
I am, sir.

352
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:18,664
I am.

353
00:26:20,883 --> 00:26:22,276
Look.

354
00:26:22,363 --> 00:26:23,451
I found this.

355
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,705
Who's there?

356
00:27:03,752 --> 00:27:05,711
Hey, we're on the same team.

357
00:27:09,018 --> 00:27:10,411
Sorry.

358
00:27:10,498 --> 00:27:12,369
There's some

359
00:27:12,456 --> 00:27:14,067
strange things going on
out here.

360
00:27:14,154 --> 00:27:16,373
Guess I'm a little jumpy.

361
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,766
I'm Corporal Solomon Jones.

362
00:27:17,853 --> 00:27:19,159
No way.

363
00:27:19,246 --> 00:27:20,726
Quiet.

364
00:27:20,813 --> 00:27:21,901
I'm sorry.

365
00:27:21,988 --> 00:27:24,643
I just think I had a relative

366
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:28,081
who fought in the Civil War,
named Solomon Jones.

367
00:27:28,168 --> 00:27:31,345
My name is Alan Jones.

368
00:27:31,432 --> 00:27:34,087
I think you're my great,

369
00:27:34,174 --> 00:27:36,655
great, great,
great grandpa...

370
00:27:36,742 --> 00:27:38,700
-What are you talking about?
-...or something.

371
00:27:38,787 --> 00:27:41,398
Yeah. No, you're right,
it couldn't be you.

372
00:27:41,485 --> 00:27:43,662
I think he lost his left arm.

373
00:27:45,533 --> 00:27:46,534
Quiet.

374
00:27:47,578 --> 00:27:48,579
Hey, it's me.

375
00:27:49,972 --> 00:27:50,972
Alan, we need to get outta here.

376
00:27:51,017 --> 00:27:52,003
Okay.

377
00:27:52,018 --> 00:27:53,802
What is this kid doing here?

378
00:27:53,889 --> 00:27:57,980
This kid is going to figure out
how to kill those monsters.

379
00:27:58,067 --> 00:27:59,416
Now, which way did they go?

380
00:28:00,548 --> 00:28:01,592
They're headed north.

381
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:04,160
Quiet.

382
00:28:12,429 --> 00:28:14,344
Calm down, it's just me.

383
00:28:14,431 --> 00:28:15,781
I'm coming with you.

384
00:28:15,868 --> 00:28:17,086
Virginia, what're you
doing here?

385
00:28:17,173 --> 00:28:19,393
I'm not needed
in the tent anymore.

386
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,829
I feel safer with them.

387
00:28:20,916 --> 00:28:22,352
They know what's going on.

388
00:28:24,267 --> 00:28:25,355
With him?

389
00:28:26,617 --> 00:28:27,793
I can't just let you go.

390
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,620
What if those monsters
come back?

391
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:32,145
I thought you could take out
ten of them with just one arm.

392
00:28:32,232 --> 00:28:33,363
Let's go.

393
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,066
You did hear me say "monsters"?

394
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:46,767
All right.

395
00:28:47,682 --> 00:28:48,727
If you're gonna go die,

396
00:28:49,945 --> 00:28:51,164
I might as well go with you.

397
00:28:53,122 --> 00:28:55,124
What is this, Lieutenant?

398
00:28:55,211 --> 00:28:57,431
I've never seen anything
like this before.

399
00:28:58,954 --> 00:29:01,827
I... I took it from a boy.

400
00:29:01,914 --> 00:29:04,655
He said that
it made the monsters

401
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,832
and that maybe
it could destroy them.

402
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:11,750
Maybe we should see
what it does.

403
00:29:11,837 --> 00:29:13,403
Close the flaps.

404
00:30:27,347 --> 00:30:28,739
Are you sure
they came this way?

405
00:30:31,438 --> 00:30:32,438
No.

406
00:30:33,266 --> 00:30:35,224
I think we may have lost
their trail.

407
00:30:35,311 --> 00:30:37,574
How do you lose the trail
of a hundred Frankensteins?

408
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,751
Well, you're welcome to try.

409
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:43,754
Alan!

410
00:30:52,589 --> 00:30:53,677
Alan, wake up.

411
00:30:59,683 --> 00:31:01,033
-It happened again.
-What?

412
00:31:02,338 --> 00:31:04,427
I could... I could see them.

413
00:31:04,514 --> 00:31:06,342
You... You saw the monsters?

414
00:31:06,429 --> 00:31:07,735
Yeah.

415
00:31:07,822 --> 00:31:10,129
They were attacking, um...

416
00:31:10,216 --> 00:31:11,565
There was

417
00:31:11,652 --> 00:31:12,652
a balloon

418
00:31:13,393 --> 00:31:14,916
and a basket.

419
00:31:15,003 --> 00:31:16,003
Balloon?

420
00:31:17,353 --> 00:31:18,354
I know where that is.

421
00:31:19,442 --> 00:31:20,443
Follow me.

422
00:31:26,928 --> 00:31:28,930
How are you able to see
where they are?

423
00:31:29,017 --> 00:31:30,540
I don't know.

424
00:31:30,627 --> 00:31:32,586
I do. It's your eye.

425
00:31:32,673 --> 00:31:33,615
What?

426
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:35,023
You know, your eye,

427
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:37,765
the one the doctor used
for the experiment.

428
00:31:37,852 --> 00:31:39,332
How is that even possible?

429
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:41,203
Why don't you ask him?
Oh, wait...

430
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:43,292
You can't.
'Cause you killed him.

431
00:31:43,379 --> 00:31:44,990
Don't put that on me, okay?

432
00:31:45,077 --> 00:31:47,383
You think I meant
to flip that switch?

433
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:49,995
Like I wanted my eye
ripped out of its socket.

434
00:31:50,082 --> 00:31:51,953
He was killing people, okay?

435
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,520
I didn't ask for any of this.

436
00:31:53,607 --> 00:31:55,087
He never killed anyone.

437
00:31:55,174 --> 00:31:56,523
You don't know
what he was doing.

438
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:57,698
You don't know anything.

439
00:31:58,742 --> 00:32:00,179
I know he deserved to die.

440
00:32:06,402 --> 00:32:07,795
Hey.

441
00:32:07,882 --> 00:32:10,015
Hey! Enough!

442
00:32:10,102 --> 00:32:11,668
Both of you.

443
00:32:11,755 --> 00:32:12,974
Now be quiet.

444
00:32:13,061 --> 00:32:14,497
Or I'll shoot you

445
00:32:14,584 --> 00:32:15,585
myself.

446
00:32:18,197 --> 00:32:19,197
Now move.

447
00:32:25,117 --> 00:32:26,945
What the hell are they?

448
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:43,657
How can we hurt them?

449
00:32:43,744 --> 00:32:44,469
Don't you mean
how can we hurt "him"?

450
00:32:44,484 --> 00:32:46,007
What?

451
00:32:46,094 --> 00:32:49,010
We need to find ours.
The one from our universe.

452
00:32:58,498 --> 00:32:59,716
That's the one.

453
00:32:59,803 --> 00:33:01,675
I see what he sees.

454
00:33:01,762 --> 00:33:03,198
Get behind me.

455
00:33:03,285 --> 00:33:04,460
Wait, Solomon.

456
00:33:06,027 --> 00:33:07,420
This is what I do, darlin'.

457
00:33:26,265 --> 00:33:27,266
Shoot him, Alan.

458
00:33:38,538 --> 00:33:39,582
Load your gun!

459
00:34:14,313 --> 00:34:15,575
Virginia!

460
00:34:15,662 --> 00:34:17,838
We won't be able to
catch up to it.

461
00:34:17,925 --> 00:34:19,013
We gotta go.

462
00:34:39,207 --> 00:34:41,122
No, please!

463
00:34:41,209 --> 00:34:42,297
No, stop!

464
00:34:43,298 --> 00:34:44,517
No!

465
00:34:44,604 --> 00:34:45,779
Alan.

466
00:34:45,866 --> 00:34:47,607
Alan! What did you see?

467
00:34:49,478 --> 00:34:50,523
He was going to kill her.

468
00:34:52,307 --> 00:34:53,307
She's dead by now.

469
00:34:54,788 --> 00:34:55,789
I'm sorry.

470
00:34:57,312 --> 00:34:58,966
We have to keep following
that balloon.

471
00:35:01,751 --> 00:35:03,231
If we, if we...

472
00:35:03,318 --> 00:35:04,928
If we kill it, they'll all die.

473
00:35:13,023 --> 00:35:14,329
I can't believe she's gone.

474
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:17,898
You really loved her,
didn't you?

475
00:35:22,163 --> 00:35:24,122
She didn't know it yet,
but she loved me too.

476
00:35:27,821 --> 00:35:29,170
I was gonna marry her.

477
00:35:32,826 --> 00:35:34,088
I have to find her.

478
00:35:37,396 --> 00:35:40,138
Why don't you wanna come back
to our time, Alan?

479
00:35:40,225 --> 00:35:42,401
Isn't there anyone back home?

480
00:35:42,488 --> 00:35:44,272
Like you care.

481
00:35:44,359 --> 00:35:47,406
I mean, after all, you did
rip out my eye and kidnap me.

482
00:35:47,493 --> 00:35:49,669
Look, I'm sorry, but

483
00:35:49,756 --> 00:35:51,279
I was doing what
I thought I had to do.

484
00:35:54,021 --> 00:35:55,631
Doctor mentioned something
about a girl.

485
00:35:57,938 --> 00:35:58,939
Ashley.

486
00:36:01,681 --> 00:36:02,812
I was gonna propose to her.

487
00:36:04,423 --> 00:36:05,641
But

488
00:36:05,728 --> 00:36:07,556
I saw her kissing another man.

489
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,171
She says

490
00:36:13,258 --> 00:36:14,694
that it's not
what it looks like.

491
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,483
I don't know if I believe her.

492
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:24,007
Why not? Has she ever
given you reason not to?

493
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,101
No.

494
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:36,150
And what are you, some sort of
love expert now?

495
00:36:36,237 --> 00:36:37,456
We need to get back home.

496
00:36:37,543 --> 00:36:39,327
That's where
we're supposed to be.

497
00:36:39,414 --> 00:36:40,459
You know...

498
00:36:40,546 --> 00:36:42,548
You know, besides all the...

499
00:36:42,635 --> 00:36:44,985
All the shooting
and the stabbing

500
00:36:45,072 --> 00:36:46,987
and people getting their arms
ripped off by Frankensteins,

501
00:36:47,074 --> 00:36:48,641
I think it's
a pretty nice place.

502
00:36:50,164 --> 00:36:51,600
What?

503
00:36:51,687 --> 00:36:53,123
We got a problem,
I lost the balloon.

504
00:36:54,864 --> 00:36:56,605
Alan, do your eye thing.

505
00:36:56,692 --> 00:36:57,867
See if you can find 'em.

506
00:36:57,954 --> 00:37:00,522
That's not how it works, okay?

507
00:37:00,609 --> 00:37:03,221
I don't just turn it on
and off whenever I...

508
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,354
Then what good are you?

509
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:23,763
No!

510
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:26,896
Shackles and chains

511
00:37:26,983 --> 00:37:29,769
They marched me away

512
00:37:32,859 --> 00:37:34,295
Sorry, sorry.

513
00:37:36,297 --> 00:37:39,648
They marched me away

514
00:37:41,781 --> 00:37:45,567
Away from my home
across the sea

515
00:37:48,527 --> 00:37:52,052
Master say, "Go"
And I go

516
00:37:54,533 --> 00:37:58,711
Master say, "Sow"
And I sow

517
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,891
O Lord, will I ever be free?

518
00:38:07,459 --> 00:38:08,764
O Lord

519
00:38:11,114 --> 00:38:12,812
Will I ever be free?

520
00:38:31,091 --> 00:38:33,136
They don't understand you,
do they?

521
00:38:38,751 --> 00:38:40,361
They don't understand us either.

522
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:45,845
They judge us

523
00:38:45,932 --> 00:38:47,194
because we're different
from them.

524
00:38:51,938 --> 00:38:52,939
The North.

525
00:38:54,723 --> 00:38:56,203
The North understands...

526
00:38:59,162 --> 00:39:00,250
Lincoln.

527
00:39:01,426 --> 00:39:03,210
He wants to free the slaves.

528
00:39:11,174 --> 00:39:12,175
I...

529
00:39:14,613 --> 00:39:16,092
I was a slave, you know, and...

530
00:39:18,617 --> 00:39:19,617
Maggie and I, we,

531
00:39:21,097 --> 00:39:22,142
we got away, but...

532
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:29,584
we almost didn't make it.

533
00:39:35,285 --> 00:39:36,374
But our,

534
00:39:37,287 --> 00:39:38,287
our family, they,

535
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,770
they are still there
on that plantation.

536
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:46,558
And that's why we joined
the fight for the North so,

537
00:39:46,645 --> 00:39:48,298
so that we can help free them.

538
00:39:50,257 --> 00:39:53,913
Why, why are you so, so mad?

539
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:00,963
Is it... is it
because you're scared?

540
00:40:02,791 --> 00:40:06,142
Oh, no, don't be scared, you...

541
00:40:06,229 --> 00:40:07,274
you are,

542
00:40:08,623 --> 00:40:09,929
you are,

543
00:40:10,016 --> 00:40:11,887
are so strong.

544
00:40:15,978 --> 00:40:18,024
If, if only,

545
00:40:18,111 --> 00:40:19,547
if you would join us,

546
00:40:19,634 --> 00:40:21,070
if you would fight for us.

547
00:40:22,681 --> 00:40:24,596
We, we could win this war.

548
00:40:31,864 --> 00:40:33,213
We can free the slaves.

549
00:40:34,823 --> 00:40:37,347
Listen, listen... you...

550
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:41,961
You can help us free the slaves.

551
00:40:44,354 --> 00:40:45,878
Yes...

552
00:40:45,965 --> 00:40:46,965
Yes.

553
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,664
Yes.

554
00:41:59,952 --> 00:42:01,562
Hey, don't worry about it.

555
00:42:03,085 --> 00:42:04,085
We'll find her.

556
00:42:10,397 --> 00:42:12,355
So, that body back there...

557
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:15,445
There is a war going on.

558
00:42:19,232 --> 00:42:20,233
Thanks.

559
00:42:23,671 --> 00:42:24,671
Nice.

560
00:42:28,981 --> 00:42:29,982
What is this, alcohol?

561
00:42:31,418 --> 00:42:32,811
I can't drink this,
I'm just a kid.

562
00:42:34,464 --> 00:42:35,901
Thought you were tougher
than that, kid.

563
00:42:35,988 --> 00:42:37,859
Hey, he's plenty tough.

564
00:42:37,946 --> 00:42:39,165
This kid's a grave robber.

565
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:43,909
It's not like I really ever
had a choice.

566
00:42:46,868 --> 00:42:48,522
I was just a baby
when the doctor found me

567
00:42:48,609 --> 00:42:50,916
that night in the dumpster.

568
00:42:54,963 --> 00:42:56,530
I was abandoned.

569
00:42:56,617 --> 00:42:57,617
Left for dead.

570
00:43:04,233 --> 00:43:05,176
Huh.

571
00:43:05,191 --> 00:43:06,671
How about that?

572
00:43:06,758 --> 00:43:09,369
You know, I wish I could
remember when I was a baby.

573
00:43:09,456 --> 00:43:11,458
Look, it's the story
the doctor told me, I,

574
00:43:11,545 --> 00:43:13,199
I don't have a reason
not to believe it.

575
00:43:13,286 --> 00:43:14,766
Oh, no, no, he...

576
00:43:14,853 --> 00:43:16,506
definitely sounds like
someone you can trust.

577
00:43:19,031 --> 00:43:21,599
He treated me like
I was his own son.

578
00:43:23,426 --> 00:43:24,689
He taught me everything I know

579
00:43:24,776 --> 00:43:25,907
science, technology.

580
00:43:27,953 --> 00:43:32,479
He became obsessed with stories
about Frankenstein's monster.

581
00:43:32,566 --> 00:43:34,437
Oh, Igor,
please come here,

582
00:43:34,524 --> 00:43:35,830
there's something
I must show you.

583
00:43:37,702 --> 00:43:38,702
Igor.

584
00:43:39,573 --> 00:43:41,053
Why do you call me Igor?

585
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:42,184
Is that my real name?

586
00:43:42,271 --> 00:43:44,447
No, I don't know your real name.

587
00:43:44,534 --> 00:43:47,189
You see, Igor, in stories,

588
00:43:47,276 --> 00:43:49,627
was an assistant
to a mad scientist

589
00:43:49,714 --> 00:43:51,541
who was trying to bring
the dead back to life.

590
00:43:55,458 --> 00:43:57,243
What would you think
if I told you

591
00:43:57,330 --> 00:44:00,028
it's not just a story anymore?

592
00:44:00,115 --> 00:44:02,030
So, you're calling yourself

593
00:44:02,117 --> 00:44:03,641
a mad scientist?

594
00:44:03,728 --> 00:44:07,427
Me, mad?

595
00:44:08,907 --> 00:44:10,082
Of course not.

596
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,219
He claimed he was able
to develop nanobots

597
00:44:17,306 --> 00:44:19,613
which could
reanimate dead cells.

598
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:20,962
No more whiskey for you.

599
00:44:23,008 --> 00:44:24,313
A syringe full of the serum

600
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,576
came through the portal
with us, Alan.

601
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:29,710
But a confederate soldier
took it from me.

602
00:44:29,797 --> 00:44:32,539
So they can use it to
raise people from the dead.

603
00:44:32,626 --> 00:44:34,149
No.

604
00:44:34,236 --> 00:44:37,587
They don't have the proper
equipment to do that.

605
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,111
It's the living
I'm worried about.

606
00:44:43,898 --> 00:44:44,898
What was that?

607
00:44:46,292 --> 00:44:47,859
It's a forest. There's animals.

608
00:44:49,425 --> 00:44:50,470
You're safe by the fire.

609
00:44:58,130 --> 00:44:59,130
What the hell?

610
00:45:12,144 --> 00:45:14,015
-Distract it.
-Why me?

611
00:45:14,102 --> 00:45:15,277
Just do it.

612
00:45:17,627 --> 00:45:19,673
Hey! Hey!

613
00:45:22,545 --> 00:45:23,808
Come here!

614
00:45:30,771 --> 00:45:31,816
My arm!

615
00:45:33,426 --> 00:45:34,993
I need your gunpowder first.

616
00:45:37,386 --> 00:45:38,518
Guys.

617
00:45:38,605 --> 00:45:39,824
Hurry up.

618
00:45:39,911 --> 00:45:41,434
Cause I can't
hold it off forever.

619
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:44,132
Hold on, I'm working on it.

620
00:45:49,877 --> 00:45:50,878
Put this on the wound.

621
00:45:57,319 --> 00:45:58,320
Here, kitty.

622
00:46:06,851 --> 00:46:09,331
What the fuck was that?

623
00:46:14,902 --> 00:46:18,123
I think the chance of you guys
being related just went way up.

624
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:19,864
This doesn't make any sense.

625
00:46:19,951 --> 00:46:21,561
This happened because of
what we did.

626
00:46:21,648 --> 00:46:23,476
Solomon could've lost his arm
to a cannonball

627
00:46:23,563 --> 00:46:25,086
or a sword in another timeline.

628
00:46:25,173 --> 00:46:27,436
But we showed up
and changed the timeline.

629
00:46:27,523 --> 00:46:29,438
He was supposed to lose his arm,
so he did.

630
00:46:29,525 --> 00:46:31,310
How could you possibly know
any of that?

631
00:46:31,397 --> 00:46:32,398
Books.

632
00:46:32,485 --> 00:46:33,485
Don't you read?

633
00:46:34,661 --> 00:46:36,358
Oh, no, you still
call him "Frankenstein."

634
00:46:36,445 --> 00:46:37,446
That's his name.

635
00:46:40,536 --> 00:46:41,581
Come on.

636
00:47:51,651 --> 00:47:53,000
Now, that's an improvement.

637
00:47:54,828 --> 00:47:55,829
Let's go.

638
00:48:02,444 --> 00:48:05,099
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Easy, big fella.

639
00:48:05,186 --> 00:48:07,101
You may be bulletproof,

640
00:48:07,188 --> 00:48:08,668
but I reckon she ain't.

641
00:48:18,808 --> 00:48:19,809
Come on.

642
00:48:27,339 --> 00:48:28,557
There's the corporal.

643
00:48:31,386 --> 00:48:33,345
Hey, help here.

644
00:48:33,432 --> 00:48:34,912
-What happened?
-His arm.

645
00:48:37,262 --> 00:48:38,480
Cauterize
the wound, please.

646
00:48:38,567 --> 00:48:39,568
Next to the nerve endings.

647
00:48:39,655 --> 00:48:40,743
The what?

648
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:42,049
Just clean it up
the best you can.

649
00:48:51,058 --> 00:48:52,059
Hey, sweetness.

650
00:48:53,669 --> 00:48:55,671
You like a man in uniform?

651
00:48:55,758 --> 00:48:57,195
Go away!

652
00:48:59,849 --> 00:49:01,634
What're you gonna do about it?

653
00:49:01,721 --> 00:49:02,896
I'm the man with the gun.

654
00:49:12,775 --> 00:49:14,168
Virginia.

655
00:49:14,255 --> 00:49:15,517
You saw Virginia?

656
00:49:16,518 --> 00:49:17,563
She's alive.

657
00:49:28,095 --> 00:49:29,618
No, I'm not leaving you behind.

658
00:49:32,447 --> 00:49:35,102
Whatever you do to us,
you will never win this war.

659
00:49:35,189 --> 00:49:36,799
The North is stronger.

660
00:49:36,886 --> 00:49:39,324
Keep her quiet, Lieutenant.

661
00:49:39,411 --> 00:49:40,412
No.

662
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:42,718
No, don't touch me!

663
00:49:42,805 --> 00:49:43,806
Stop!

664
00:49:46,418 --> 00:49:47,462
So,

665
00:49:47,549 --> 00:49:49,551
this is one of your monsters

666
00:49:49,638 --> 00:49:52,772
that won't die,
Lieutenant Swanson?

667
00:49:52,859 --> 00:49:53,860
Yes, sir.

668
00:49:54,513 --> 00:49:55,949
Bullets

669
00:49:56,036 --> 00:49:57,255
do them no harm.

670
00:49:59,648 --> 00:50:00,910
What will this do?

671
00:50:05,959 --> 00:50:08,570
You saw what it did
to your cat, sir.

672
00:50:08,657 --> 00:50:10,920
I fear it could make him
only stronger.

673
00:50:12,792 --> 00:50:14,489
This one's strong enough.

674
00:50:16,926 --> 00:50:19,146
Inject yourself, Lieutenant.

675
00:50:22,889 --> 00:50:24,412
I beg your pardon...

676
00:50:24,499 --> 00:50:25,499
Soldier...

677
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:33,420
Now!

678
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:27,475
What have you done to me?

679
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:31,914
Kill them both.

680
00:51:39,444 --> 00:51:40,444
Please, stop.

681
00:51:45,667 --> 00:51:47,582
No, please don't hurt him.

682
00:51:47,669 --> 00:51:49,106
Lieutenant,

683
00:51:49,193 --> 00:51:50,324
put him down.

684
00:51:51,673 --> 00:51:52,674
Lieutenant!

685
00:51:53,762 --> 00:51:54,763
Down.

686
00:51:58,158 --> 00:52:00,204
And you, young lady.

687
00:52:00,291 --> 00:52:02,119
Run back to your camp.

688
00:52:02,206 --> 00:52:04,512
And take your weak friend
with you.

689
00:52:11,954 --> 00:52:13,304
Why

690
00:52:13,391 --> 00:52:14,391
did you...

691
00:52:17,395 --> 00:52:18,395
Let them go?

692
00:52:19,919 --> 00:52:22,835
I want the North to know
what is coming for 'em.

693
00:52:24,532 --> 00:52:25,532
Fear

694
00:52:26,882 --> 00:52:28,449
will be the first punch.

695
00:52:30,103 --> 00:52:31,148
And you

696
00:52:33,019 --> 00:52:34,586
will be the knockout blow.

697
00:52:39,678 --> 00:52:40,679
Move!

698
00:53:26,072 --> 00:53:28,205
Ugh! I thought
the whiskey was bad.

699
00:53:31,469 --> 00:53:33,514
I just got orders
from Washington.

700
00:53:33,601 --> 00:53:36,561
Tomorrow we are giving up our
position. Heading back north.

701
00:53:36,648 --> 00:53:39,912
We can't leave.
Virginia's still out there.

702
00:53:39,999 --> 00:53:41,609
My sister's alive.

703
00:53:41,696 --> 00:53:44,133
-How do you know?
-Trust me, I know.

704
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:46,223
We can't afford to lose
any more men.

705
00:53:46,310 --> 00:53:48,486
With those monsters out there,
we don't stand a chance

706
00:53:48,573 --> 00:53:50,444
if the rebels decide
to attack again.

707
00:53:54,318 --> 00:53:55,406
Virginia!

708
00:54:05,154 --> 00:54:06,547
That's for not coming
to save me.

709
00:54:08,419 --> 00:54:10,551
Listen to me, all of you.

710
00:54:10,638 --> 00:54:12,901
The rebels are coming.
They'll be here in the morning.

711
00:54:17,863 --> 00:54:20,518
It's okay.
They're not gonna hurt you.

712
00:54:20,605 --> 00:54:22,346
It gets worse.

713
00:54:22,433 --> 00:54:25,305
Somehow they've created their
own monster who fights for them.

714
00:54:25,392 --> 00:54:27,699
All the more reason for us
to follow our orders

715
00:54:27,786 --> 00:54:29,657
and get out of here
as fast as we can.

716
00:54:29,744 --> 00:54:32,399
No! We must make our stand here.

717
00:54:32,486 --> 00:54:33,661
If the South
takes this position,

718
00:54:33,748 --> 00:54:35,315
they will win this war.

719
00:54:35,402 --> 00:54:39,145
We don't stand a chance.
Look around us. It's suicide.

720
00:54:39,232 --> 00:54:42,235
Any moment those things
could decide to rip us apart.

721
00:54:42,322 --> 00:54:43,323
They won't.

722
00:54:43,410 --> 00:54:45,064
Why not, Virginia?

723
00:54:45,151 --> 00:54:47,066
We've all seen what they can do.

724
00:54:47,153 --> 00:54:48,154
Because...

725
00:54:49,329 --> 00:54:51,505
Okay, I know this sounds crazy.

726
00:54:51,592 --> 00:54:54,552
But because they wanna
fight for us.

727
00:55:06,172 --> 00:55:08,435
Prepare yourselves, men.

728
00:55:08,522 --> 00:55:11,308
Tomorrow we make
our final stand.

729
00:55:14,441 --> 00:55:15,660
Yes!

730
00:55:16,443 --> 00:55:17,836
Let them come!

731
00:55:17,923 --> 00:55:20,404
Let them face
our army of Frankensteins!

732
00:55:45,211 --> 00:55:46,211
Look at them.

733
00:55:47,387 --> 00:55:49,389
They think some monster's
going to save us.

734
00:55:52,261 --> 00:55:53,350
Let's go.

735
00:55:54,438 --> 00:55:56,178
Just you and me.

736
00:55:56,265 --> 00:55:58,572
Just like we were back
on the plantation.

737
00:55:58,659 --> 00:56:01,880
We can't always
just run away, Maggie.

738
00:56:01,967 --> 00:56:03,185
This isn't our war to fight.

739
00:56:03,272 --> 00:56:04,272
It's still mine!

740
00:56:05,187 --> 00:56:07,320
And I remember a time
when it was yours, too.

741
00:56:10,062 --> 00:56:11,672
He understands us.

742
00:56:11,759 --> 00:56:13,718
-Who?
-The Frankenstein.

743
00:56:15,328 --> 00:56:16,895
Don't you get it?

744
00:56:16,982 --> 00:56:19,376
He knows that the North
is fighting to protect us.

745
00:56:19,463 --> 00:56:21,943
And, with their help,
we may actually have a chance.

746
00:56:25,556 --> 00:56:27,427
Where are you going, Maggie?

747
00:56:27,514 --> 00:56:31,213
Don't you dare run away
from here by yourself.

748
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:32,824
I'm just checking on my patient.

749
00:56:47,491 --> 00:56:48,579
Hey!

750
00:56:48,666 --> 00:56:50,145
You can't do that in here!

751
00:56:50,232 --> 00:56:51,232
I keep it close to Solomon.

752
00:56:52,757 --> 00:56:56,108
You and your friends
brought those monsters here.

753
00:56:56,195 --> 00:56:58,719
Glad we did.
Can help you win the war.

754
00:56:58,806 --> 00:57:00,678
I don't want them to help us!

755
00:57:00,765 --> 00:57:03,768
They're dangerous!
They killed Jimmy!

756
00:57:03,855 --> 00:57:04,855
Jimmy?

757
00:57:06,118 --> 00:57:08,337
Look, I don't know
what they are,

758
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:10,862
but you brought them here,
you take them back!

759
00:57:10,949 --> 00:57:12,603
Why?

760
00:57:12,690 --> 00:57:16,389
They make the perfect soldiers.
They can't be hurt.

761
00:57:16,476 --> 00:57:18,652
Well, I guess ours can be hurt.

762
00:57:21,350 --> 00:57:22,350
What?

763
00:57:23,744 --> 00:57:26,791
The one from our universe.
Connected with Alan.

764
00:57:28,619 --> 00:57:29,968
I guess you could hurt that one.

765
00:57:37,062 --> 00:57:39,499
Look, I'm really sorry
about Jimmy,

766
00:57:39,586 --> 00:57:41,762
but trust me,
you don't want him back.

767
00:57:43,503 --> 00:57:45,070
The dead make lousy company.

768
00:58:00,564 --> 00:58:01,826
Rest. You need to rest.

769
00:58:01,913 --> 00:58:03,392
What are you doing? He's fine.

770
00:58:05,177 --> 00:58:07,658
Oh, so you're a doctor now, too?

771
00:58:12,924 --> 00:58:14,316
What the hell?

772
00:58:14,403 --> 00:58:15,666
It's a fully functional

773
00:58:15,753 --> 00:58:17,537
electromagnetic
plasma coil cannon.

774
00:58:20,148 --> 00:58:22,586
-Cannon?
-No!

775
00:58:22,673 --> 00:58:24,065
This isn't right!

776
00:58:24,152 --> 00:58:27,504
You can't go around
sewing cannons to people.

777
00:58:27,591 --> 00:58:29,941
He's not one of your monsters.

778
00:58:30,028 --> 00:58:31,116
What's wrong with you?

779
00:58:39,037 --> 00:58:40,038
So?

780
00:58:41,561 --> 00:58:43,215
You'll show me how to use
this thing or not?

781
00:58:44,782 --> 00:58:46,261
I thought you'd never ask.

782
00:58:53,486 --> 00:58:55,444
-Who's that?
-That's a bad guy.

783
00:58:57,098 --> 00:58:58,491
Doesn't look so bad to me.

784
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:13,462
That's more like it.

785
00:59:18,642 --> 00:59:20,339
So, how does this work, kid?

786
00:59:20,426 --> 00:59:22,559
I found some circuit board,
some of the nanobot serum...

787
00:59:22,646 --> 00:59:23,908
Aah, I didn't come out here
for school!

788
00:59:23,995 --> 00:59:25,562
This is important.

789
00:59:25,649 --> 00:59:27,999
I've connected it
to your nervous system.

790
00:59:28,086 --> 00:59:29,566
My what?

791
00:59:29,653 --> 00:59:31,480
Just try to make a gun
with your missing hand.

792
00:59:33,352 --> 00:59:35,659
A gun with my missing hand?

793
00:59:35,746 --> 00:59:38,009
-How?
-Just think about it.

794
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:42,491
All right.

795
00:59:47,235 --> 00:59:50,587
-Now what?
-Just pull the trigger.

796
01:00:02,424 --> 01:00:03,512
I like this!

797
01:00:08,517 --> 01:00:09,606
Hey.

798
01:00:14,219 --> 01:00:16,613
You know we tried to follow you
in the balloon.

799
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:19,267
Just ran into some trouble.

800
01:00:20,965 --> 01:00:22,488
I'm sorry I hit you.

801
01:00:24,185 --> 01:00:25,447
I'll live.

802
01:00:27,188 --> 01:00:29,190
You know, Solomon likes you.

803
01:00:29,277 --> 01:00:30,452
A lot.

804
01:00:31,758 --> 01:00:33,281
I like him a lot, too, and

805
01:00:34,413 --> 01:00:35,849
I might have even married him.

806
01:00:39,070 --> 01:00:40,985
You, you might have?

807
01:00:41,072 --> 01:00:42,116
Yeah.

808
01:00:43,291 --> 01:00:44,423
Until I met you.

809
01:00:53,171 --> 01:00:54,259
Virginia?

810
01:00:55,216 --> 01:00:56,870
You're alive?

811
01:00:56,957 --> 01:00:58,437
What the hell is this?

812
01:00:58,524 --> 01:00:59,699
It's not what it looks like.

813
01:01:04,356 --> 01:01:06,619
Did you guys see
what I did with his arm?

814
01:01:06,706 --> 01:01:07,751
It's cool, right?

815
01:01:23,418 --> 01:01:24,637
Hey, what's the plan?

816
01:01:26,117 --> 01:01:27,684
What are you doing here?

817
01:01:27,771 --> 01:01:30,948
Shouldn't you be back
in the tents with the women?

818
01:01:31,035 --> 01:01:32,950
I want to be here, okay?
I can fight, too.

819
01:01:36,388 --> 01:01:37,694
About last night
with Virginia...

820
01:01:37,781 --> 01:01:40,827
If we survive this,
I aim to kill you.

821
01:01:45,789 --> 01:01:47,051
Hey, what's that?

822
01:01:53,231 --> 01:01:56,190
Sir, the enemy is behind us.

823
01:01:56,277 --> 01:01:57,714
They're coming
at a forced march.

824
01:01:57,801 --> 01:01:59,716
Do not be surprised
at what you see.

825
01:02:01,935 --> 01:02:05,460
All right, gentlemen,
I want you to get ready.

826
01:02:05,547 --> 01:02:07,724
This could very well be
our last stand,

827
01:02:07,811 --> 01:02:09,595
so I want you to be prepared.

828
01:02:09,682 --> 01:02:11,815
We've got no idea what's coming
out of those trees.

829
01:02:11,902 --> 01:02:15,035
So I want you to be ready.

830
01:02:15,122 --> 01:02:19,648
One thing: we must protect
this Frankenstein.

831
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:21,433
The one with the flower.

832
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:24,262
If he dies, they will all die.

833
01:02:24,349 --> 01:02:26,786
Can we get him out of here?
Get him off the line?

834
01:02:26,873 --> 01:02:29,310
You can't just
get him out of here.

835
01:02:29,397 --> 01:02:31,312
If he's not here,
none of the rest will fight.

836
01:02:31,399 --> 01:02:32,661
What're you doing here, kid?

837
01:03:24,539 --> 01:03:26,498
What's going on?

838
01:03:26,585 --> 01:03:28,413
I don't know.
But I don't like it.

839
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:03,752
What the hell?

840
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:28,429
Charge!

841
01:04:29,953 --> 01:04:30,954
Go!

842
01:06:43,782 --> 01:06:44,913
Maggie?

843
01:06:53,922 --> 01:06:54,967
Maggie?

844
01:07:44,016 --> 01:07:45,670
Much obliged, ma'am.

845
01:07:49,891 --> 01:07:51,067
Get her.

846
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:09,085
Maggie!

847
01:08:16,309 --> 01:08:17,309
Ugh!

848
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:22,359
There'â€™s something wrong.

849
01:08:24,143 --> 01:08:25,449
I think I can fix it.

850
01:08:27,277 --> 01:08:29,279
I, I might be able
to get you one more shot.

851
01:08:31,716 --> 01:08:32,804
Maggie!

852
01:08:35,589 --> 01:08:36,634
Maggie?

853
01:08:46,078 --> 01:08:47,166
What have you done?

854
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:55,305
I'm sorry.

855
01:08:55,392 --> 01:08:58,438
No, no, don't say that.
Don't say that.

856
01:08:58,525 --> 01:09:00,136
Somebody get something!

857
01:09:02,050 --> 01:09:03,182
I can fix this.

858
01:09:06,229 --> 01:09:07,317
Maggie.

859
01:09:16,064 --> 01:09:18,937
We were supposed to win
this war together.

860
01:09:19,024 --> 01:09:20,156
Remember?

861
01:09:46,356 --> 01:09:48,184
Lieutenant Jacobs,
Mr. President.

862
01:09:53,972 --> 01:09:55,887
I hear your company
held the front lines

863
01:09:55,974 --> 01:09:59,107
despite being
significantly outnumbered.

864
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:00,283
How did you do it?

865
01:10:01,762 --> 01:10:03,024
We had help, sir.

866
01:10:13,470 --> 01:10:15,559
Is this some kind
of a joke, Lieutenant?

867
01:10:15,646 --> 01:10:19,432
No, sir, it is exactly
what I saw with my own eyes.

868
01:10:21,565 --> 01:10:23,219
Who's responsible for this?

869
01:10:23,306 --> 01:10:26,744
A soldier named Alan Jones.
And the young boy, Igor.

870
01:10:26,831 --> 01:10:28,615
They brought the monsters to us.

871
01:10:30,356 --> 01:10:32,663
They say Alan can see through
the eyes of the monsters.

872
01:10:38,756 --> 01:10:40,061
Thank you, Lieutenant.
That will be all.

873
01:10:44,892 --> 01:10:47,373
Send a telegram
to the front lines.

874
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:51,769
Summon Alan Jones and Igor
to Washington DC.

875
01:10:51,856 --> 01:10:52,944
Yes, Mr. President.

876
01:10:54,554 --> 01:10:55,555
And one more thing.

877
01:10:57,296 --> 01:11:01,735
Tell them to bring one
of their creatures with them.

878
01:11:01,822 --> 01:11:02,954
Yes, sir.

879
01:11:40,644 --> 01:11:44,517
I suppose you've come to tell me
about some supreme victory

880
01:11:44,604 --> 01:11:48,304
on the battlefield
with your secret weapon?

881
01:11:50,175 --> 01:11:51,175
No, General.

882
01:11:52,220 --> 01:11:56,312
-Our campaign did not resolve...
-This way, Walton.

883
01:11:56,399 --> 01:11:58,009
...the way we had planned.

884
01:12:01,926 --> 01:12:02,926
Stay.

885
01:12:04,189 --> 01:12:09,803
It has become apparent to me
that we cannot win this war

886
01:12:09,890 --> 01:12:10,890
on the battlefield.

887
01:12:12,284 --> 01:12:17,985
That's why I'm sending you
and your monster freak

888
01:12:18,072 --> 01:12:19,073
to Washington.

889
01:12:20,771 --> 01:12:25,471
General, please do not
take me off the front lines.

890
01:12:25,558 --> 01:12:29,083
Stop your sniveling
and your whining, Robert.

891
01:12:29,170 --> 01:12:31,564
I'm sending you undercover.

892
01:12:33,958 --> 01:12:38,005
Here's the address of
the contact that you will meet

893
01:12:38,092 --> 01:12:39,833
in three days.

894
01:12:42,140 --> 01:12:46,753
And try not to draw
too much attention to yourself.

895
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:51,584
Yes, General.

896
01:13:02,943 --> 01:13:04,118
General,

897
01:13:05,511 --> 01:13:07,644
how will I know my contact?

898
01:13:09,036 --> 01:13:11,169
Ask for Mr. Booth.

899
01:13:34,105 --> 01:13:36,281
Sol, will you join us?

900
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:39,415
Sorry, things to do elsewhere.

901
01:13:39,502 --> 01:13:41,721
Sol, please.

902
01:13:56,693 --> 01:13:59,260
Look, this probably isn't
the best time to bring this up,

903
01:13:59,347 --> 01:14:01,480
but you two

904
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:03,482
need to get married.

905
01:14:03,569 --> 01:14:04,657
What?

906
01:14:04,744 --> 01:14:06,833
Right, Solomon,

907
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:09,357
you plan on, uh, asking her
to marry you, right?

908
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:10,881
I did.

909
01:14:10,968 --> 01:14:16,190
Right. Virginia, you plan
on saying yes, right?

910
01:14:16,277 --> 01:14:19,324
This isn't fair, Alan.
Why are you doing this?

911
01:14:19,411 --> 01:14:20,411
In fact... Well...

912
01:14:21,674 --> 01:14:26,026
I'm fairly certain
that you two are my great,

913
01:14:26,113 --> 01:14:28,072
great, great grandparents.

914
01:14:29,595 --> 01:14:31,728
And if you don't get married,

915
01:14:31,815 --> 01:14:32,903
I'll never get born.

916
01:14:34,078 --> 01:14:35,383
It's actually four greats.

917
01:14:36,602 --> 01:14:37,690
Who's counting?

918
01:14:39,170 --> 01:14:41,520
No. Leave me alone.

919
01:14:41,607 --> 01:14:42,608
All of you.

920
01:14:47,787 --> 01:14:49,310
Well done, Alan.

921
01:14:49,397 --> 01:14:51,051
What? I'm sorry.

922
01:14:51,138 --> 01:14:54,664
Just make her fall in love
with you again or something.

923
01:14:54,751 --> 01:14:55,882
Go to hell.

924
01:14:57,493 --> 01:14:58,929
Telegram for Alan Jones.

925
01:14:59,016 --> 01:15:00,104
Ho, yeah.

926
01:15:02,193 --> 01:15:03,281
Thanks.

927
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:10,723
What's it say?

928
01:15:12,856 --> 01:15:14,118
Listen to this.

929
01:15:15,293 --> 01:15:16,293
"To, Alan Jones.

930
01:15:17,556 --> 01:15:21,038
"Bring the boy
and one of the monsters

931
01:15:21,125 --> 01:15:23,693
"to the White House
immediately."

932
01:15:23,780 --> 01:15:25,042
Huh?

933
01:15:25,129 --> 01:15:27,871
"Signed, Abraham Lincoln."

934
01:15:29,133 --> 01:15:30,351
Abraham Lincoln!

935
01:15:32,005 --> 01:15:34,791
Lincoln. Huh?

936
01:15:34,878 --> 01:15:35,879
Solomon, wait.

937
01:15:40,231 --> 01:15:41,362
Like on the penny.

938
01:15:44,061 --> 01:15:45,192
What is it, kid?

939
01:15:46,846 --> 01:15:48,108
I need to give you this.

940
01:15:52,373 --> 01:15:53,505
Don't open it.

941
01:15:54,637 --> 01:15:56,290
So when?

942
01:15:56,377 --> 01:15:57,596
Open it when I'm gone.

943
01:16:01,513 --> 01:16:02,819
Whatever you say, kid.

944
01:16:34,938 --> 01:16:36,374
Why is all this happening to me?

945
01:16:37,941 --> 01:16:41,292
Is it possible for me
to love both of them?

946
01:16:41,379 --> 01:16:46,340
Is what Alan says true?
Am I supposed to marry Solomon?

947
01:16:46,427 --> 01:16:48,473
You're supposed to do what
your heart tells you, Virginia.

948
01:16:52,085 --> 01:16:56,089
It's true. I have loved you
for a very long time.

949
01:16:56,176 --> 01:16:57,569
But no one,

950
01:16:57,656 --> 01:16:59,832
including Alan or myself,

951
01:16:59,919 --> 01:17:02,356
can ever tell you
what to do again.

952
01:17:02,443 --> 01:17:04,663
This isn't a plantation.
Those days are done.

953
01:17:08,014 --> 01:17:09,233
Hey, there you are, big guy.
Come on.

954
01:17:11,844 --> 01:17:13,019
What's gotten into you?

955
01:17:13,106 --> 01:17:14,804
Come on,
we're needed in Washington.

956
01:17:14,891 --> 01:17:16,414
Washington?

957
01:17:16,501 --> 01:17:19,460
Yeah. We got a telegram
from Honest Abe.

958
01:17:19,547 --> 01:17:22,072
It said for Igor and I
to bring Frank to Washington.

959
01:17:22,159 --> 01:17:25,423
Why do you act like you want
nothing to do with me?

960
01:17:25,510 --> 01:17:27,294
It's not you.

961
01:17:27,381 --> 01:17:29,906
-It's Ashley.
-Who's Ashley?

962
01:17:29,993 --> 01:17:31,559
She's from the future.

963
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:33,170
And every moment
that I spend here,

964
01:17:33,257 --> 01:17:35,259
is one that I'm not
spending with her.

965
01:17:35,346 --> 01:17:37,043
I don't know how,
but I gotta get home.

966
01:17:40,568 --> 01:17:42,962
Well, I hope you find what
you're looking for, Alan Jones.

967
01:17:44,921 --> 01:17:46,531
Go.

968
01:17:46,618 --> 01:17:47,924
Go!

969
01:17:48,011 --> 01:17:49,229
-Go!
-Come on.

970
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:59,849
That is
quite a story, gentlemen.

971
01:17:59,936 --> 01:18:03,330
Is it true you can see
through the creature's eye?

972
01:18:03,417 --> 01:18:05,768
Yes, Honest Abe, sir.

973
01:18:05,855 --> 01:18:07,378
I can't control
when that happens though.

974
01:18:09,380 --> 01:18:10,598
Honest Abe.

975
01:18:12,252 --> 01:18:15,342
No one's ever
called me that before.

976
01:18:15,429 --> 01:18:16,692
I like that.

977
01:18:23,350 --> 01:18:24,525
What do you think, sir?

978
01:18:27,615 --> 01:18:31,881
Well, if I am to be Honest Abe,
it doesn't look exactly like me.

979
01:18:31,968 --> 01:18:32,968
Close enough.

980
01:18:34,013 --> 01:18:36,886
Uh, could you give us
a moment, please?

981
01:18:36,973 --> 01:18:38,061
Thank you.

982
01:18:46,199 --> 01:18:50,595
Gentlemen, I didn't bring you
here out of my own curiosity.

983
01:18:50,682 --> 01:18:54,555
I have a mission for you
if you're willing to accept it.

984
01:18:54,642 --> 01:18:56,993
I hear that Robert E. Walton
and his creature

985
01:18:57,080 --> 01:18:59,691
are here in Washington DC.

986
01:18:59,778 --> 01:19:01,737
I want you to find out
what he's doing here

987
01:19:01,824 --> 01:19:03,129
and report back to me.

988
01:19:04,261 --> 01:19:05,653
This is gonna be so much fun.

989
01:19:08,918 --> 01:19:11,094
This is so boring.

990
01:19:11,181 --> 01:19:13,574
I don't understand.
I should be getting a reading.

991
01:19:13,661 --> 01:19:15,576
-There. Finally.
-Why's it doing that?

992
01:19:15,663 --> 01:19:16,839
He's close.

993
01:19:25,282 --> 01:19:26,500
Hey, there they are.

994
01:19:33,333 --> 01:19:35,509
Yeah, that's him,
all right. Just as I thought.

995
01:19:35,596 --> 01:19:37,337
His nanobot count
is off the charts.

996
01:19:40,993 --> 01:19:42,212
Come here.

997
01:19:43,735 --> 01:19:44,910
Hmm.

998
01:19:44,997 --> 01:19:46,607
Sorry.
Need to borrow this.

999
01:19:51,047 --> 01:19:53,223
Don't worry.
I'll give it back.

1000
01:19:54,702 --> 01:19:56,182
What's that?

1001
01:19:56,269 --> 01:19:58,794
It amplifies the signal
between you and your eye.

1002
01:19:58,881 --> 01:20:00,796
This way we can control
your visions.

1003
01:20:09,848 --> 01:20:11,458
Yup, it's working.

1004
01:20:11,545 --> 01:20:12,677
Good.

1005
01:20:17,203 --> 01:20:18,509
Hey.

1006
01:20:18,596 --> 01:20:20,250
You don't have to do this alone.

1007
01:20:20,337 --> 01:20:22,252
Yes, I do.
It has to be done this way.

1008
01:20:24,515 --> 01:20:26,082
What?

1009
01:20:26,169 --> 01:20:28,824
Sorry, I just remembered
something your friend told me.

1010
01:20:28,911 --> 01:20:30,173
What is it?

1011
01:20:30,260 --> 01:20:32,044
It's nothing.
Don't worry about it.

1012
01:20:32,131 --> 01:20:33,306
I'm ready.

1013
01:20:35,134 --> 01:20:36,309
This is going to work.

1014
01:21:34,193 --> 01:21:38,632
Desperate times call for
desperate measures, Mr. Booth.

1015
01:21:44,334 --> 01:21:45,509
What's in it for me?

1016
01:21:47,990 --> 01:21:50,862
My friend won't
tear off your arms.

1017
01:21:59,349 --> 01:22:02,091
I got no love for the Union,
I can promise you that!

1018
01:22:04,832 --> 01:22:08,053
Killing Lincoln
will be reward enough.

1019
01:22:08,140 --> 01:22:09,140
Good.

1020
01:22:10,012 --> 01:22:14,494
Remember, three nights
from tonight at Ford's Theater.

1021
01:22:16,540 --> 01:22:18,455
Hey, how old are you?

1022
01:22:20,413 --> 01:22:22,676
Get out of here! Hey!

1023
01:22:24,330 --> 01:22:25,330
I'm talking to you.

1024
01:22:26,854 --> 01:22:29,857
It's the boy.
The boy that gave me the serum.

1025
01:23:13,031 --> 01:23:14,206
It hurts a lot, Alan.

1026
01:23:15,686 --> 01:23:18,080
-Worse than I thought it would.
-Hey.

1027
01:23:18,167 --> 01:23:19,864
No, no, no.

1028
01:23:19,951 --> 01:23:23,215
You're gonna be okay. All right?
We're gonna get you out of here.

1029
01:23:26,305 --> 01:23:27,480
I can't move.

1030
01:23:35,749 --> 01:23:36,924
Told you I'd give it back.

1031
01:23:43,105 --> 01:23:45,629
Don't you die on me. Okay?

1032
01:23:45,716 --> 01:23:47,935
We, we're gonna get you back
to our time.

1033
01:23:49,981 --> 01:23:52,288
You can, you can stay
with me and Ashley.

1034
01:23:54,116 --> 01:23:56,379
There's no going back
for me, Alan.

1035
01:23:58,076 --> 01:24:00,165
You can go home though.

1036
01:24:00,252 --> 01:24:02,167
But only if they all die.

1037
01:24:03,255 --> 01:24:04,822
Then the portal will reopen.

1038
01:24:06,128 --> 01:24:09,174
You mean, if, if he dies?

1039
01:24:12,351 --> 01:24:13,700
Yes.

1040
01:24:15,441 --> 01:24:16,573
He dies,

1041
01:24:18,096 --> 01:24:19,315
they all die.

1042
01:24:22,753 --> 01:24:24,059
I don't want him to die.

1043
01:24:26,017 --> 01:24:27,453
I don't want you to die.

1044
01:24:57,004 --> 01:24:58,223
That can't be good.

1045
01:24:59,485 --> 01:25:01,183
What was that?

1046
01:25:01,270 --> 01:25:02,270
Look.

1047
01:25:03,446 --> 01:25:06,188
-Where are they going?
-North.

1048
01:25:07,624 --> 01:25:09,756
They're going to Washington.

1049
01:25:09,843 --> 01:25:11,106
How do you... Virginia!

1050
01:25:12,585 --> 01:25:14,935
Our orders were to stay here.

1051
01:25:15,022 --> 01:25:16,850
He called to them.

1052
01:25:16,937 --> 01:25:18,200
Something is wrong.

1053
01:25:18,287 --> 01:25:20,071
They're going to help
and so am I.

1054
01:25:22,117 --> 01:25:24,249
You're going no matter
what I say, aren't you?

1055
01:25:28,601 --> 01:25:31,213
You know, Washington is
three days march from here.

1056
01:25:31,300 --> 01:25:32,997
So grab some food
and water!

1057
01:25:37,480 --> 01:25:38,829
It's for the monsters.

1058
01:25:47,794 --> 01:25:48,926
I'm sorry, Mr. President.

1059
01:25:50,362 --> 01:25:51,972
We don't have
the resources available

1060
01:25:52,059 --> 01:25:54,018
to give him a proper burial.

1061
01:25:54,105 --> 01:25:55,759
I understand.

1062
01:25:55,846 --> 01:25:56,977
Thank you.

1063
01:26:04,028 --> 01:26:05,508
He was very brave.

1064
01:26:06,726 --> 01:26:08,032
He died getting information

1065
01:26:08,119 --> 01:26:11,296
that every sixth grader
already knows.

1066
01:26:11,383 --> 01:26:12,689
How could I be so stupid?

1067
01:26:14,734 --> 01:26:16,171
You can't go!

1068
01:26:16,258 --> 01:26:19,478
I have told you.
I'm still going to the theater.

1069
01:26:19,565 --> 01:26:23,656
I must show this country
that we are not to be afraid.

1070
01:26:23,743 --> 01:26:26,050
We will not hide from those
who wish to go against us.

1071
01:26:26,137 --> 01:26:27,660
They'll be expecting you.

1072
01:26:27,747 --> 01:26:28,879
You'll be shot
by John Wilkes Booth.

1073
01:26:28,966 --> 01:26:30,315
It's in the history books!

1074
01:26:30,402 --> 01:26:34,232
Are you in the history books,
Alan? Is he?

1075
01:26:34,319 --> 01:26:35,755
No, of course not.

1076
01:26:35,842 --> 01:26:37,322
Well, then, it seems
your history books

1077
01:26:37,409 --> 01:26:39,846
are not quite accurate,
are they?

1078
01:26:39,933 --> 01:26:41,631
Now, I will go to the theater.

1079
01:26:41,718 --> 01:26:44,242
And I will not be shot
by Mr. Booth.

1080
01:26:44,329 --> 01:26:45,939
Why?

1081
01:26:46,026 --> 01:26:48,768
Because you and your friend

1082
01:26:48,855 --> 01:26:50,509
are going to be there
to stop him.

1083
01:26:57,516 --> 01:26:59,431
They're moving faster now.

1084
01:26:59,518 --> 01:27:00,518
Try and keep up.

1085
01:27:01,825 --> 01:27:04,523
We don't even know where they're
going for sure, Virginia.

1086
01:27:04,610 --> 01:27:06,482
We don't have time
for this, Solomon.

1087
01:27:06,569 --> 01:27:07,918
We have to keep up with them.

1088
01:27:08,005 --> 01:27:09,528
This was a mistake.

1089
01:27:09,615 --> 01:27:11,661
-Let's go, Solomon.
-I could be shot for this.

1090
01:27:11,748 --> 01:27:13,358
Solomon, come on!

1091
01:27:15,621 --> 01:27:16,621
Virginia.

1092
01:27:17,449 --> 01:27:18,842
Are you all right?

1093
01:27:23,890 --> 01:27:25,065
I'm sorry.

1094
01:27:30,027 --> 01:27:31,202
Let's go.

1095
01:27:33,900 --> 01:27:35,598
Damn it.

1096
01:27:35,685 --> 01:27:37,382
Which he left to you.

1097
01:27:37,469 --> 01:27:39,776
No, which he meant
to leave to me.

1098
01:27:39,863 --> 01:27:41,256
Then thought better of it
and left it

1099
01:27:41,343 --> 01:27:43,693
to his granddaughter,
Miss Merry Meredith.

1100
01:27:43,780 --> 01:27:46,739
Miss Merry Meredith.
I'm so delighted.

1101
01:28:12,504 --> 01:28:14,767
Oh, no, it's happening.

1102
01:28:14,854 --> 01:28:17,379
-What's happening?
-Whatever they're running to.

1103
01:28:17,466 --> 01:28:18,641
We don't have much time.

1104
01:29:00,900 --> 01:29:02,119
Hey!

1105
01:29:08,691 --> 01:29:10,823
You and I both know that
that bullet's not meant for me.

1106
01:29:13,478 --> 01:29:16,046
You cannot stop the inevitable.

1107
01:29:16,133 --> 01:29:18,091
Lincoln will die tonight.

1108
01:29:49,340 --> 01:29:50,559
Engage him.

1109
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:53,605
I hope this works.

1110
01:29:53,692 --> 01:29:54,737
NOW!

1111
01:30:15,148 --> 01:30:17,237
Not heir to the fortune,
Mr. Trichardt?

1112
01:30:17,324 --> 01:30:19,109
Oh, no, no.

1113
01:30:19,196 --> 01:30:22,068
You see, it all comes from
barking up the wrong tree

1114
01:30:22,155 --> 01:30:23,853
for the old man's property!

1115
01:30:47,137 --> 01:30:48,268
Come on.

1116
01:31:00,063 --> 01:31:01,847
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1117
01:31:01,934 --> 01:31:04,371
-You're an actor, right?
-Yes.

1118
01:31:04,459 --> 01:31:06,330
Well, break a leg!

1119
01:31:19,822 --> 01:31:21,171
Work, damn it!

1120
01:31:23,260 --> 01:31:25,915
Get up, you big green bastard!

1121
01:31:27,133 --> 01:31:28,265
Shit!

1122
01:31:47,893 --> 01:31:48,981
Oh, come on.

1123
01:32:19,142 --> 01:32:20,360
That's my cue.

1124
01:32:24,582 --> 01:32:26,410
I don't know who you are,

1125
01:32:27,629 --> 01:32:29,935
but you are right about me.

1126
01:32:30,022 --> 01:32:32,547
I do know my way
around a theater.

1127
01:32:58,268 --> 01:32:59,268
Last chance.

1128
01:33:00,357 --> 01:33:01,793
Turn her loose,
and I'll let you live.

1129
01:33:09,366 --> 01:33:10,585
Where did he go?

1130
01:33:14,327 --> 01:33:15,546
Too late.

1131
01:33:35,522 --> 01:33:37,481
Get up. Get back in there!

1132
01:33:37,568 --> 01:33:39,657
We are supposed to win this war!

1133
01:33:39,744 --> 01:33:42,355
You are doing nothing
down on your knees, dog.

1134
01:33:42,442 --> 01:33:44,444
Get up! You are useless...

1135
01:33:44,531 --> 01:33:46,316
You be the dog.

1136
01:33:49,536 --> 01:33:51,103
No! No!

1137
01:33:54,759 --> 01:33:56,631
No!

1138
01:33:57,762 --> 01:33:59,982
Don't look at it. Look at me.

1139
01:35:33,075 --> 01:35:34,163
What's happening?

1140
01:35:35,294 --> 01:35:36,643
He is dying.

1141
01:35:54,313 --> 01:35:57,360
S-s-stay with me, please.

1142
01:35:57,447 --> 01:35:58,753
Please don't go.

1143
01:35:58,840 --> 01:35:59,971
Don't die too.

1144
01:36:02,365 --> 01:36:05,847
Go home.

1145
01:36:22,515 --> 01:36:23,516
Stop!

1146
01:36:23,603 --> 01:36:24,779
Assassin!

1147
01:36:32,047 --> 01:36:34,179
Sic semper tyra...

1148
01:36:43,667 --> 01:36:44,842
He fell from the balcony.

1149
01:36:49,804 --> 01:36:53,198
He was, he was trying to protect
the President.

1150
01:36:53,285 --> 01:36:54,591
I warned him.

1151
01:36:54,678 --> 01:36:56,375
I warned Lincoln
that this would happen,

1152
01:36:56,462 --> 01:36:57,855
and he wouldn't listen to me.

1153
01:36:57,942 --> 01:37:00,118
This isn't your fault, Alan.

1154
01:37:03,208 --> 01:37:04,470
What is that?

1155
01:37:05,994 --> 01:37:07,169
It's my way back home.

1156
01:37:08,431 --> 01:37:09,432
I got to go.

1157
01:37:09,519 --> 01:37:10,519
Alan, wait.

1158
01:37:11,826 --> 01:37:13,436
You don't have to go back,
stay here with us.

1159
01:37:13,523 --> 01:37:14,829
I can't stay.

1160
01:37:14,916 --> 01:37:16,352
I don't belong here.

1161
01:37:17,701 --> 01:37:19,877
And I got a girl
back home that,

1162
01:37:19,964 --> 01:37:21,400
that I owe five dollars to.

1163
01:37:23,011 --> 01:37:24,011
So promise me.

1164
01:37:25,100 --> 01:37:27,711
If you find a good one, Solomon,
hold on to her.

1165
01:37:27,798 --> 01:37:29,017
And don't let her go.

1166
01:37:31,149 --> 01:37:33,325
I already have, Alan.

1167
01:37:33,412 --> 01:37:34,936
Go home to yours.

1168
01:37:35,023 --> 01:37:36,459
Goodbye, Alan.

1169
01:37:36,546 --> 01:37:39,592
We won this war thanks to you
and Frankenstein.

1170
01:37:39,679 --> 01:37:41,377
Just have a bunch of babies,
all right.

1171
01:37:41,464 --> 01:37:42,508
What?

1172
01:37:42,595 --> 01:37:44,119
I just want to be born, okay.

1173
01:37:59,612 --> 01:38:02,354
No, no!
Oh, no, shut it down!

1174
01:38:02,441 --> 01:38:04,574
No, this can't be happening!

1175
01:38:04,661 --> 01:38:06,576
Shut it down!
Shut it down!

1176
01:38:06,663 --> 01:38:07,969
Shut it down!

1177
01:38:20,764 --> 01:38:22,374
I've got something to tell you.

1178
01:38:22,461 --> 01:38:23,985
This can't be good.

1179
01:38:24,072 --> 01:38:27,292
The portal.
Don't go through the portal.

1180
01:38:27,379 --> 01:38:30,339
If you do, you're gonna...
You're gonna die.

1181
01:38:32,036 --> 01:38:34,169
Just, just don't go through
the portal.

1182
01:38:34,256 --> 01:38:35,474
Would you be here if I don't?

1183
01:38:35,561 --> 01:38:38,216
I don't know!
I don't know!

1184
01:38:38,303 --> 01:38:40,523
We can't change
what's already happened.

1185
01:38:40,610 --> 01:38:43,004
We can't re-write history.

1186
01:38:43,091 --> 01:38:45,093
Now, get out of here.

1187
01:38:45,180 --> 01:38:47,225
The tavern, don't go
to the tavern!

1188
01:39:34,142 --> 01:39:36,405
Oh, Alan! Oh!

1189
01:39:37,884 --> 01:39:39,234
I need the rent money.

1190
01:39:39,321 --> 01:39:41,018
I'm sorry, but I'm kinda busy
right now.

1191
01:39:41,105 --> 01:39:43,064
No more chances.
I need the money today.

1192
01:39:44,848 --> 01:39:47,198
-Here, take this.
-Oh!

1193
01:39:48,983 --> 01:39:50,810
Look, I'm Mrs. Jones.

1194
01:39:54,336 --> 01:39:56,512
This will do. For now.

1195
01:39:59,080 --> 01:40:00,080
Wait.

1196
01:40:01,386 --> 01:40:04,302
-Can I borrow five bucks?
-You got to be kidding me.

1197
01:40:04,389 --> 01:40:06,261
You have some nerve.

1198
01:40:06,348 --> 01:40:07,740
I'll pay you back, okay.

1199
01:40:14,791 --> 01:40:15,966
I can't wait.

1200
01:40:20,579 --> 01:40:21,754
You're welcome.

1201
01:40:29,545 --> 01:40:32,983
Code 10, we have a code 10.

1202
01:40:37,205 --> 01:40:39,337
-Where's Ashley?
-How should I know?

1203
01:40:39,424 --> 01:40:41,296
What difference
does it make anyway?

1204
01:40:41,383 --> 01:40:42,775
She doesn't want to see you.

1205
01:40:42,862 --> 01:40:45,430
And what are you wearing?

1206
01:40:45,517 --> 01:40:46,692
What do I push to use
the intercom.

1207
01:40:46,779 --> 01:40:47,911
You can't do that, Alan.

1208
01:40:47,998 --> 01:40:49,347
You don't work here anymore.

1209
01:40:55,049 --> 01:40:56,615
What do I push?

1210
01:40:56,702 --> 01:40:58,269
Star seven, star seven.

1211
01:41:05,624 --> 01:41:06,843
Attention, shoppers.

1212
01:41:09,976 --> 01:41:11,587
My name's Alan.

1213
01:41:11,674 --> 01:41:12,675
And...

1214
01:41:13,719 --> 01:41:14,938
I've been a real jerk.

1215
01:41:18,855 --> 01:41:20,161
You see,

1216
01:41:20,248 --> 01:41:22,119
I walked in on Eugene

1217
01:41:22,206 --> 01:41:23,642
and my girlfriend,
Ashley, kissing.

1218
01:41:25,731 --> 01:41:28,125
And I didn't do anything
to stop them.

1219
01:41:31,650 --> 01:41:32,869
I'm sorry, Ashley.

1220
01:41:36,786 --> 01:41:39,093
You see I've, I've had...

1221
01:41:39,180 --> 01:41:41,225
I've had a lot of time
to think about it.

1222
01:41:41,312 --> 01:41:43,662
And I

1223
01:41:43,749 --> 01:41:46,926
just want you to know that...

1224
01:41:47,013 --> 01:41:48,189
Go on.

1225
01:41:53,890 --> 01:41:54,978
Screw it.

1226
01:41:58,938 --> 01:42:00,288
Ashley, will you marry me?

1227
01:42:03,856 --> 01:42:04,901
No!

1228
01:42:05,989 --> 01:42:07,033
You know I love you Alan, but...

1229
01:42:08,600 --> 01:42:10,472
I had to loan you five bucks
just yesterday.

1230
01:42:10,559 --> 01:42:11,734
Okay, but, come on...

1231
01:42:11,821 --> 01:42:13,997
You're not ready
to get married yet.

1232
01:42:14,084 --> 01:42:15,564
I'm not either.

1233
01:42:15,651 --> 01:42:16,956
And, and what makes you think

1234
01:42:17,043 --> 01:42:19,437
you can just waltz
in here and...

1235
01:42:19,524 --> 01:42:22,136
Oh, my gosh!
What did you do to Eugene?

1236
01:42:22,223 --> 01:42:24,007
He hit him.

1237
01:42:24,094 --> 01:42:28,098
And what's with the eye patch
and the jacket?

1238
01:42:28,185 --> 01:42:29,404
Never mind.

1239
01:42:30,709 --> 01:42:31,928
I'm sorry.

1240
01:42:42,373 --> 01:42:43,373
Alan!

1241
01:42:51,687 --> 01:42:53,079
Ask me again someday.

1242
01:42:55,038 --> 01:42:56,082
Ashley!

1243
01:42:58,302 --> 01:42:59,825
I have that five bucks
I owe you.

1244
01:44:13,072 --> 01:44:15,771
"Solomon Jones."

1245
01:44:26,651 --> 01:44:29,132
"And their adopted son."

1246
01:44:35,356 --> 01:44:36,400
How?

1247
01:44:43,277 --> 01:44:45,366
Why did you bring me
here, Solomon?

1248
01:44:45,453 --> 01:44:47,237
The day Alan left
for Washington...

1249
01:44:47,324 --> 01:44:48,456
What about it?

1250
01:44:49,892 --> 01:44:51,023
The kid gave me this.

1251
01:44:53,417 --> 01:44:54,462
This note too.

1252
01:45:03,122 --> 01:45:04,733
What is this? What's going on?

1253
01:45:07,562 --> 01:45:08,650
Stand back.

1254
01:45:45,730 --> 01:45:47,558
Where are
you all from?

1255
01:45:47,645 --> 01:45:49,255
We're from the future.

1256
01:45:49,343 --> 01:45:51,214
And it's time to kick
some Frankenstein ass.

1257
01:46:46,182 --> 01:46:48,097
Fix the dimensional rift.

1258
01:47:38,147 --> 01:47:41,455
You've ruptured
the multiverse, you fool!

1259
01:47:53,075 --> 01:47:55,512
Where are
you all from?

1260
01:47:55,599 --> 01:47:56,905
We're from the future.

1261
01:48:05,043 --> 01:48:09,178
All right.
if you're going to die,

1262
01:48:09,265 --> 01:48:10,658
I might as well go with you.

1263
01:48:45,519 --> 01:48:48,260
What is
a Frankenstein?

1264
01:48:48,347 --> 01:48:50,480
It's not called
a Frankenstein.
