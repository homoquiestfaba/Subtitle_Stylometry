1
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,560
WITH/IN

2
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:52,880
VOL.2

3
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:02,880
I can't believe we could get
so many times in one night.

4
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,760
It was amazing.

5
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,079
You really are more than
I bargained for.

6
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:09,000
Oh, did you just
think I'd be a bargain?

7
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:11,079
I don't normally
take guys home.

8
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,439
Not that I regret it.

9
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:15,359
Well, it's not my speed either,

10
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,319
especially to feel like this
about somebody so soon.

11
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,359
I know.
It's crazy.

12
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,319
What time is your flight again?

13
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,239
ONE NIGHT STAND

14
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,959
Why do you have
to fly now, of all times?

15
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,719
Because it's where I live,
where I keep my stuff.

16
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:43,640
Yeah, but why now?
We don't know what's gonna happen.

17
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:46,840
-We might never see each other again.
-Don't do this, please.

18
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,280
We had such a good time, you know?
Of course, we're gonna see each other.

19
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:52,439
You don't know that.
Things are changing so fast.

20
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,719
Right.
Then you come with me to LA.

21
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:58,239
-I wasn't kidding when I asked you.
-I can't do that.

22
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,359
And next week it might be too late.
You should stay.

23
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,680
You're being so dramatic.
Just knock it off.

24
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,879
And you're being
thoughtless and glib.

25
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:11,599
It's a little early for you to be
getting so needy, don't you think?

26
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,240
Go to hell.

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,199
-Get out of my house. Leave.
-With pleasure.

28
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,560
You're too
old for me anyway.

29
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,639
That's classy.
Really.

30
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:27,639
Thank you for that.
I see I dodged a bullet.

31
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,599
-Hey.
-Hey.

32
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:49,919
-So sorry I said that.
-No.

33
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,360
I'm sorry.

34
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,919
Well, I'm glad
you changed your mind.

35
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:59,840
Yeah. There's that,
and also there's a travel ban.

36
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:02,879
So my flight...

37
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,439
-You were inside the terminal?
-Oh, it was a mad house.

38
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:12,759
I see you got your
luggage back from the hotel.

39
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,840
When I went to the front desk, they
said they were gonna close the place

40
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:17,439
soon as I left.

41
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:23,479
You should
take a shower.

42
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,639
Go take a shower.

43
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:29,439
-You want me to take a shower?
-Doesn't that sound nice?

44
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,479
-Sure.
-Go.

45
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:33,800
I might meet you in there.

46
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,560
Well, all right, then.

47
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,879
What the fuck!

48
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:27,920
Lady!

49
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:29,959
What the fuck?

50
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,279
It's only for 14 days.
I'll use the guest bathroom.

51
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:36,040
Get back here.

52
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:38,120
Get back here.

53
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:39,959
I'm gonna call the cops.

54
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,800
Do you have my phone?

55
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,040
No, haven't seen it.

56
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:58,399
What is that?

57
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:08,240
What the fuck is going on?

58
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,439
Oh, come on. Scrambled again?

59
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:42,639
Can you at least figure out how to cook
an egg without burning it?

60
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:45,800
Well, I don't cook
and no one's delivering.

61
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:48,000
So you might as well just
get used to it.

62
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,879
Oh, come on.

63
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:58,560
Shut the fuck up!

64
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,079
-What?
-You know the drill.

65
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,079
-Hands up.
-Yeah.

66
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,759
Beef Stroganoff.
I never made it before.

67
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,240
Did you know that Stroganoff
was a Russian town?

68
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,319
I eat that
shit for breakfast?

69
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:13,439
Thought you might like something to read
to pass the time.

70
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:18,319
You got anything
from this year?

71
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:28,160
You know what you're doing
is illegal, right?

72
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,240
Yeah, but what
you did should be illegal.

73
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,920
You went back to your hotel room.
You got into a filthy cab.

74
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,079
You actually even entered an
international airport...

75
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,600
All before bringing
your germs back into my home.

76
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,319
It was an Uber XL, actually.
Black SUV.

77
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,519
Oh, you just don't get it.

78
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:54,039
Mom, you have to wear
your mask all the time.

79
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,519
Well, no. Look, I'm not trying
to tell you what to do. I'm not.

80
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,120
It's just that...

81
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,360
And what did he say?
Well, tell doctor...

82
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,559
Tell him that you need it
for four weeks, Mom.

83
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,360
I'm not yelling at you.

84
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,039
All I'm saying is that
you should have it for four weeks.

85
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,039
You don't know how long this
thing is gonna take, that's all.

86
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:22,879
Okay.
And who's walking the dog right now?

87
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,919
I left your dinner.

88
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,879
Slow-poached chicken breast
with bacon dust.

89
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,759
And for dessert,
a flaming strawberry flambé.

90
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,960
Get it while it's hot.

91
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,000
This is delicious.

92
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:26,879
Glad you like it.

93
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,480
How long does it take to slow
poach a chicken?

94
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:35,080
Not very long.
It's only about 14 minutes.

95
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,000
No kidding.

96
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,559
I got it from a New York Times recipe.

97
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,320
Thank you.

98
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,600
You're welcome.

99
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,080
Appreciate it.

100
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,960
I get it now. I scared you.
I get it.

101
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,519
I'm so sorry.

102
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:57,799
I'm so sorry.

103
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:04,039
Meet you at the door.

104
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,159
It was thoughtless
of me to come back.

105
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,600
You know, never should have done it.

106
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,919
My Uber driver was sneezing,
I didn't even think about it.

107
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,679
-Did you touch him?
-Little bit.

108
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,600
I mean, in the place he asked me to.

109
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,360
I think I may
have overreacted, too.

110
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,240
Oh, you think so?

111
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:43,360
Seriously.

112
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,120
My Mom almost died
from a virus when I was a kid.

113
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,000
She was really sick for a long time

114
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,360
and I think it just triggered
something in me.

115
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,039
Ah, it must
have been awful.

116
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,799
Yeah, and then
I had to spoon-feed her

117
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:58,440
Campbell soup for four weeks
before she got any better.

118
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,080
No wonder you're
such a good cook.

119
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:08,360
I think I just get scared
when the people I love get sick.

120
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:13,000
Not that I love you or anything,
but I do care about you.

121
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:17,840
-Well, we had a good thing going.
-For 12 hours anyway.

122
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,440
Still pretty hot.

123
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:41,720
Your turn.

124
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,480
What are
you doing down there?

125
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,080
Nothing you
can't do to yourself.

126
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:53,519
Oh, I can't wait
to really touch you.

127
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:57,320
How much longer do I have
to spend in here?

128
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,799
When did we meet again?

129
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:04,720
April 10th.

130
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:09,799
Another couple of days.

131
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,400
That's too bad.

132
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,279
So, what's for dinner?

133
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,759
Well, we're all having to learn to live
without our usual comforts and routines.

134
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:21,519
I don't go for my routine
shampoo and set.

135
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:23,720
My roots are an absolute disaster.

136
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:27,519
I mean, three and a half decades
of having my nails done

137
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:30,920
and then, lo and behold, I discover
I can absolutely do it myself.

138
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,359
I could have saved absolute fortunes.

139
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:35,480
Alex.

140
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:38,240
Alex, darling, are you smoking?

141
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:40,519
No, Mom, I'm not smoking.

142
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:44,200
-You sound like you're smoking.
-Yeah, well, I'm not.

143
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,440
-You're getting lots of rest?
-I'm trying.

144
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:52,799
Oh, I want to see Jack.
Let me see him.

145
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,920
How is it I go to video?

146
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:59,240
How do I go to bloody video
on this things? Oh, I know.

147
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:02,160
Looks like something's happening.

148
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,319
Hi.
Just give me a sec, okay?

149
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:12,440
I'm gonna go into the house.

150
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,240
Doesn't look like
a very nice day there.

151
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:19,480
-Is it nice where you are?
-Absolutely glorious day.

152
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:22,039
That's nice.

153
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,160
Okay.

154
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:33,480
Yeah, look, there he is.
Look at that.

155
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,880
Look at the little face.
Oh, he's just marvelous.

156
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,559
Alex.

157
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,599
Is that the wardrobe?
What's he doing in the wardrobe?

158
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:47,759
Mom, it's dark in here.

159
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:51,079
-It's the only place he'll go to sleep.
-Okay, I'm sorry.

160
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,640
-For goodness sake.
-Please don't wake him.

161
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,200
Okay.

162
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:05,839
Are you taking any exercise?
Taking any fresh air?

163
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:11,559
It will do you good.
You look absolutely exhausted.

164
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,839
Thank you.

165
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:19,319
-Darling, I wish I was there with you.
-Yeah, well, you're not.

166
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:24,559
Honestly, I'd rather that you
were alone, than with him.

167
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,720
Mom.

168
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:31,960
Leaving you alone at a time like this,
what was he thinking of?

169
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:33,559
Mom.

170
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:35,599
Where is he anyway?

171
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,559
Where do you think?

172
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,920
Well, you know,
just got to keep yourself busy.

173
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,759
Distract yourself.

174
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:52,839
Listen, no drinking, please.

175
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:55,519
You know it makes you emotional.

176
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:58,119
Mom, I'm hanging up now.
I'm gonna hang up.

177
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,720
Look, let me just say one thing.

178
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:02,519
This is really important,
'cause I read about it.

179
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:04,200
The deliveries.

180
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,960
72 hours quarantine.

181
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:09,960
That's what they say, 72 hours.
Alex.

182
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,079
Alex, are you listening?

183
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,960
Shut up.

184
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:02,000
Better now?

185
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:04,480
I got to go.

186
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,480
Hey Siri.

187
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:28,079
Set a timer for four minutes.

188
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,279
Okay, four minutes and counting.

189
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,440
Okay, stop. Stop.

190
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,920
Okay.

191
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,880
It's ready.

192
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,920
Oh, fuck.

193
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,359
Cereal it is.

194
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,640
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

195
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,160
Hey Siri.
Can you sing a lullaby?

196
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,880
I'd rather leave
that to the professionals.

197
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,440
Okay.
Yeah, thanks a lot, Siri.

198
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:52,440
Medical catastrophe as rapidly increasing
cases spread like wild fire across...

199
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:54,160
Hey Siri.

200
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,200
How many people died of COVID today
in North America?

201
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:04,960
Hey Siri,
turn on the TV.

202
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,599
Hey Siri.
Turn on the TV.

203
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,039
Hey Siri, set the timer
for seven minutes.

204
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,359
Playing Cartoon Network.

205
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:44,480
Yeah, sure. Whatever.

206
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:48,920
Good morning.

207
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,920
Good morning, teacher.

208
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Good morning. Oh, how cute.

209
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,240
Eat, eat, eat your egg

210
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:17,039
Hey Siri.

211
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,279
-Hello, Alex.
-Play a lullaby.

212
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,759
Playing lullaby.

213
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,960
Thank you, Siri.

214
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,920
It feels nice.

215
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:43,279
You're welcome, Alex.

216
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,240
Starting timer, 72 hours.

217
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:23,240
Hey, I didn't ask you to do that.

218
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:25,480
You're welcome, Alex.

219
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,200
And what's with
the British accent?

220
00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:30,559
I'm not sure
I have an answer for that.

221
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:33,400
I mean, it's fine.

222
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,559
-Kinda like it.
-How marvelous!

223
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,720
Siri, this place is a mess.

224
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,000
Would you like
me to play some music for you?

225
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:49,839
Yeah.

226
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:52,000
That'd be great.

227
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,440
Sleep can boost
your immune system.

228
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,680
That's great.

229
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,599
Benefits of chamomile tea.

230
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:03,920
Shut up, Siri.

231
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,039
Hey Siri, turn the light back on.

232
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:38,720
Setting alarm, 6:00 a.m.

233
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:44,599
Fuck you, Siri!

234
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:50,880
-Your alarm is now set for 6:00 a.m.
-No, I don't want to go to bed!

235
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,480
Don't worry, you got this!

236
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:36,759
You are mooorvelous.

237
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,680
What the fuck!

238
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,400
Siri.

239
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,839
Call David.

240
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,079
I'm not
sure I understand.

241
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,799
This number is disconnected.

242
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,039
Oh, you bitch!

243
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,000
Would you
like me to play some music?

244
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:13,319
No, I want
you to fuck off.

245
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:19,319
Call David.

246
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,119
Call David!

247
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,319
Come on, Siri. Don't fuck with me!

248
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:29,359
Goddamn it.

249
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,920
You want to go in there?
Do you want to go in there?

250
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,519
Don't tempt me, you little bitch.

251
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:42,279
Oh, shut the fuck up!

252
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:44,400
Leave me alone!

253
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:03,400
I'm coming.

254
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,079
Mommy coming.

255
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:09,519
-Hey Siri.
-Good morning, Alex.

256
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:13,640
-How's it going?
-Oh, cute.

257
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:16,079
Very funny.

258
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:20,079
-Where is she?
-I'm not sure what you mean.

259
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:23,240
Oh, whatever, asshole.

260
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:25,480
Just tell me how long
to cook this fucking egg.

261
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:29,599
Egg. Noun. An oval or round object
laid by a female bird,

262
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:32,680
reptile or fish or invertebrate,

263
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:35,000
usually containing
a developing embryo.

264
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:38,319
Right, so, what?
You're just going to mansplain me now?

265
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,480
Mansplain. Verb.
Of a man to explain something to someone,

266
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:47,000
typically a woman, in a manner
regarded as condescending or patro...

267
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,359
Siri.

268
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,039
Siri.

269
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,599
Hello.

270
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,119
-I'm listening.
-Oh, thank God.

271
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,960
How are you today?

272
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,839
I'm fine.
Thanks for asking.

273
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:21,599
I'm sorry
about last night.

274
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:29,839
You must have a lot on
your plate right now.

275
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:32,799
I'm here to help.

276
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:44,640
So, what's the weather like outside?

277
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:48,119
The temperature
is 21 degrees centigrade.

278
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:51,960
Marvelous.

279
00:32:58,279 --> 00:33:01,119
Follow the path
due north for 200 meters.

280
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,319
In 50 meters, you
will reach your destination.

281
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,599
Marvelous.

282
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,039
Bed soft and white.

283
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:09,760
All the creatures of the day,

284
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:16,840
need the rest from work and play.

285
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,400
When the new day shall break,

286
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:27,320
full of joy you will wake.

287
00:34:31,559 --> 00:34:33,320
Setting alarm, 06:00 a.m.

288
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:36,119
Thank you, Siri.

289
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:45,159
Good night, darling.

290
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,559
Good night, darling.

291
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,119
You're not even wearing gloves?

292
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,840
Fuck off!

293
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:58,280
NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH

294
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:11,119
Thanks.

295
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:14,639
So, you're fine here?

296
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:18,039
No desperate desire to come and play
Scrabble with the kids or something?

297
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:21,159
Honey,
I'd love to play Monopoly

298
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:24,079
but I got to stop these fuckers
touching my damn fence!

299
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:40,360
He's still on the...

300
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,360
Yup.

301
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,000
It's your move.

302
00:37:57,679 --> 00:37:59,119
I reckon he's gone crazy.

303
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,800
Am I being unreasonable
or should he shave?

304
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,159
He should shave, right?
Or at least have a shower.

305
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:11,960
What he should do is give it a rest
and come back to the land of the living.

306
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:13,559
I heard that.

307
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,840
I still don't understand why us two
can't just go back to the city

308
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:23,079
and see people that are
actually interesting.

309
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:25,280
I mean, we can't even die of it.

310
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:30,480
Well, I don't think it's a good idea.

311
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:34,719
And even if I was to sign off on it,
good luck getting pass the man upstairs.

312
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,800
It's your turn.

313
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:42,280
Hey, come on.

314
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,519
-Come on. Wake up, wake up.
-What?

315
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,199
All right,
so I got a pretty crazy idea,

316
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,000
but you got to just indulge me
for a second, all right?

317
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,320
All right.

318
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:57,960
Okay, so, we can both agree that
we got to get out of this place, right?

319
00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:00,239
Sure.

320
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,000
So why don't
we just do it?

321
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,639
Me, you, no Mum,
and definitely no Dad.

322
00:39:07,159 --> 00:39:10,119
We can go to the city and we
can see all our friends

323
00:39:10,199 --> 00:39:13,280
and it will pretty much just
be exactly like normal.

324
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:20,159
And Mum pretty much just signed
off on it anyway.

325
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:25,920
Okay, but fuck off.
I'm trying to sleep.

326
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,679
We should tie him up,

327
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,119
so he doesn't wake up
and screw the plan.

328
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,280
Agreed.

329
00:40:24,679 --> 00:40:27,199
-Hey, could you stop that?
-No.

330
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:36,199
I know what we should do.
Let's go and get some fresh air.

331
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:39,800
Wait but by fresh air,
do you mean just going out in the car

332
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,360
and staying in the car?

333
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,719
Hey, you want to come?
We're going to go for a drive.

334
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,639
Yeah.

335
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:50,440
Maybe we could do it tonight, like
maybe 11 p.m or something,

336
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:52,679
when the front lawn activity goes down?

337
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,519
I want you to step away
from the fence.

338
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,599
Step away from the fence.

339
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,280
What is he doing?

340
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,159
You know our doorbell that's got
that camera and everything?

341
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:34,239
It's got a two-way speaker.

342
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:38,119
At least he came.

343
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:40,400
Whatever, we're here now.

344
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:42,920
Look how beautiful it is.

345
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:53,559
Stop, what the hell
do you think you're doing?

346
00:41:54,039 --> 00:41:56,199
-Going for a walk.
-No.

347
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,960
You can get fresh air from here.

348
00:41:58,039 --> 00:42:00,679
You'll get a tic in there and
get Lyme's disease and die.

349
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,760
Hey, don't go into the forest.

350
00:42:03,079 --> 00:42:06,280
You get a tic in there, and you get
Lyme's disease and then die.

351
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,239
Okay.

352
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,960
I made you guys some cookies.

353
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:25,280
I don't care how brave you're feeling.
You could be asymptomatic.

354
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,280
You could be running up
and down my block,

355
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:30,159
you could still be spreading
it all over the place.

356
00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:33,760
Wait, is that the antibody test?
It's unreliable.

357
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:36,400
Fauci says the antibody
test is unreliable.

358
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,400
These are great, Mum.

359
00:42:39,239 --> 00:42:41,360
You keep staying outside my fence,

360
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,840
and I'm watching you 14 days,
then you can touch the fence.

361
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:50,679
How about Monopoly?

362
00:42:51,039 --> 00:42:52,400
That takes ages, though.

363
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,280
But we've got ages.

364
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:00,119
Well, what else is there here?
We could do a puzzle.

365
00:43:00,199 --> 00:43:01,960
That only takes a couple of days.

366
00:43:02,039 --> 00:43:04,559
No, we don't have
time for a puzzle, do we?

367
00:43:06,039 --> 00:43:08,599
Okay, well, what else?
There's Parcheesi.

368
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,920
There's Risk.

369
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,400
There's Sorry.

370
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,199
I think there's Cl...
yeah, there's Clue.

371
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,159
We could play chess.

372
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:22,000
Why don't
we just play Go Fish.

373
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:25,039
Go Fish. Okay.

374
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,239
Yeah.
Well, let's play Go Fish.

375
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:32,639
Hey, you want to come and hang?

376
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,440
Yup.

377
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,159
Can I hang from up here?

378
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:46,519
Totally, no, that's... Yeah, why not?
We can hear you from down here.

379
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,920
It's a great idea.

380
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:55,400
One good thing is that, apparently
only 6% of people

381
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:59,760
can get it again, which means that
New York will have herd immunity,

382
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,159
or whatever you call it,
really quite soon.

383
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:03,880
So that's great.

384
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:07,000
Mum, did you read that from the New York
Times article this morning?

385
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:10,280
-Yeah.
-It was 60%, not 6%.

386
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,639
Well, if you think about it,
that's not... No, That isn't great.

387
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:39,840
Do you have it?

388
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,199
...into quarantine, we are
not out of the woods yet.

389
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,679
And with the vaccine months away
from approval, sheltering in place...

390
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:58,719
Good luck, asshole.

391
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:30,679
Did we get the time
wrong or something?

392
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:51,320
It's pretty cold.

393
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,480
Yeah.

394
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,960
-Did you bring a coat?
-No.

395
00:45:58,119 --> 00:46:00,519
-Me neither.
-But I brought this.

396
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,079
Do you want to go home?

397
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:28,880
Yeah.

398
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:52,199
STILL LIFE

399
00:48:54,719 --> 00:48:57,039
It's Ethan. I assume internet outage.
We're fine here.

400
00:48:57,559 --> 00:49:00,400
Still stuck in Paris. But I need to hear
from you at some point.

401
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,159
Jesse tested negative,
which is really supreme.

402
00:49:03,239 --> 00:49:06,280
We are officially in her
second trimester, officially.

403
00:49:07,719 --> 00:49:09,119
Call me, please.

404
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,559
Hi, it's Peg. I sent you an email
but I guess your satellite's still funky.

405
00:49:15,559 --> 00:49:17,880
Anyway, interest in the show is insane.

406
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:20,239
I'm going ahead
with the opening virtually.

407
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:22,639
It's your dream.
Online, you don't have to come.

408
00:49:22,719 --> 00:49:25,199
But we need to get the new
pieces photographed like yesterday.

409
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,960
Definitely the big stone one.
Call me. Bye.

410
00:49:30,159 --> 00:49:32,760
Hi, it's Carl at the pharmacy.
We have your prescriptions.

411
00:49:33,079 --> 00:49:35,159
Just pull up outside,
and we'll bring them out.

412
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,519
Helen, this goddamn wedding.

413
00:49:39,079 --> 00:49:41,559
Hey, I'm in a fix here.

414
00:49:41,639 --> 00:49:43,440
Postpone or cancel?

415
00:49:44,039 --> 00:49:46,280
Hey, what would you take?

416
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,760
Valium, Xanax, Placidil...

417
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:52,320
Hi, Mum.
You really need to call.

418
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,800
I know you're handling what you need
to handle, the way you handle things.

419
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:01,559
Ethan, I'm fine.
Just busy.

420
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:34,239
Helen.

421
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:37,199
Pick up.

422
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:40,519
Pick up.

423
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:42,840
God damn it!

424
00:50:43,199 --> 00:50:44,519
Pick up!

425
00:50:45,199 --> 00:50:47,159
Pick up, pick up, pick up...

426
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:53,159
Hello, Helen Feld.
This is Chip at Betz Fabricate.

427
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:55,400
We have the flanges and panels.

428
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:58,119
Just need to confirm the delivery site
and new protocols.

429
00:50:58,199 --> 00:51:01,360
Call me at 800-565-7555.

430
00:51:01,719 --> 00:51:03,599
I sent you an email,
but your dealer said

431
00:51:03,679 --> 00:51:06,960
your internet is pretty spotty
out there these days. Thanks.

432
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:12,760
Look, I know I shouldn't worry,
but I...

433
00:51:13,719 --> 00:51:15,639
That's right.
You shouldn't worry.

434
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:21,840
A boy? That's wonderful.
I'll call him Jackie.

435
00:52:22,159 --> 00:52:23,760
How much do I owe you?

436
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:27,199
Doctor says: Nothing, Jackie
already paid me.

437
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:52,239
Mrs. Feld, leave a message.

438
00:52:54,039 --> 00:52:56,960
Helen Feld,
this is Rachel Gay from Art Union.

439
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:00,239
I spoke with you a year ago,
an interview, actually,

440
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:03,440
which I don't know if you ever saw it,
but it's quite nice. Brilliant, really.

441
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,599
Thank god I've kept your number.

442
00:53:05,679 --> 00:53:09,400
We're doing this piece on how artists
are living during this difficult time.

443
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:32,920
Hi, it's Carl again from the pharmacy.

444
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,199
Just wondering if you were coming by
for your prescriptions.

445
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,639
Just pull up outside
and we'll bring them out.

446
00:53:37,719 --> 00:53:39,760
-Okay, let us know.
-No more pills, Carl.

447
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:53,800
Fuck you, Dave!

448
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,800
Fuck you, Dave!

449
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,400
My god, I mean
criminal responsibilities.

450
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:25,199
Don't think for one minute
we're going to let you escape.

451
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,400
We're going to throw you into jail.

452
00:55:48,239 --> 00:55:49,920
Now, that is a hole.

453
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,360
Hiya.

454
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,079
The festival is over

455
00:55:55,159 --> 00:55:58,199
And the boys were all
planning for a fall

456
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:01,039
-You're in a Dylan phase.
-Never out of it, really.

457
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:03,039
And yet, you
don't know the words.

458
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:06,199
-You're so god damn beautiful.
-Oh, shut up.

459
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,440
-And take off that mask.
-Nope.

460
00:56:08,519 --> 00:56:10,199
Well, then fuck off.

461
00:56:13,639 --> 00:56:16,679
Because that's where he would lie
when I was digging that pond.

462
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:18,920
That's why the hole was there.

463
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,519
-It was a pain in the ass to dig.
-Why you'll appreciate it.

464
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:23,800
Appreciate it.
Oh brother.

465
00:56:27,079 --> 00:56:29,480
You know, Ethan and Jesse
are having a baby.

466
00:56:29,559 --> 00:56:32,159
-But I guess you already know that.
-I did not know that.

467
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:36,280
It doesn't work that way, apparently.
What do you think about that?

468
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:37,639
I think it's a good thing.

469
00:56:37,719 --> 00:56:40,199
When you have a kid you stop
being someone else's.

470
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:41,480
I don't know if it's true.

471
00:56:41,559 --> 00:56:43,400
Oh, why would
you agree with me now?

472
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:48,599
I'm selling all the cows.
All the blooded stock.

473
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:53,159
And your tractors, and your implements,
and all your tool sets.

474
00:56:53,639 --> 00:56:58,119
-Not my dad's socket set.
-Especially your dad's socket set.

475
00:56:58,199 --> 00:57:02,079
Every god damn wrench.
Pliers, spreaders, splitting maul.

476
00:57:02,159 --> 00:57:05,840
-Yeah, and give me that axe.
-Oh, this is not mine.

477
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,239
-This was issued.
-Issued?

478
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:11,400
Yeah, before that I got
this really cool water pail.

479
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:13,360
It's around somewhere.

480
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,800
-Everything must go, buddy.
-That is right.

481
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:23,039
You're going to wait
here while I go get him?

482
00:57:23,719 --> 00:57:25,159
He's right there, babe.

483
00:57:28,199 --> 00:57:30,679
Oh god.
I'm so absent minded.

484
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:34,280
-Yet so present bodied.
-Shut up.

485
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:38,000
Hey, see.

486
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,039
Oh, buddy.

487
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:04,079
Oh god.
I miss that little dog.

488
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:08,079
-You do?
-Yeah, who would have thunk?

489
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:11,800
Oh, he was a good dog.

490
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:14,719
-Remember that time up on the...
-Hush.

491
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:17,320
Please.

492
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:40,519
You need to work, Helen.

493
00:58:41,159 --> 00:58:42,639
Well, I can't.

494
00:58:43,519 --> 00:58:44,960
I can't work.

495
00:58:45,679 --> 00:58:47,320
I can't do anything.

496
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:52,079
And I hate you.

497
00:58:52,639 --> 00:58:55,119
I hate you for missing this.

498
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:59,119
All this... you just escaped

499
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:03,920
this stupid, scary bullshit
murderous time

500
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,519
of a bloated fucking clown.

501
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:16,159
You were just a lucky, dead,
uninformed, complicit,

502
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:19,719
complacent mother fucker.

503
00:59:20,679 --> 00:59:22,679
-Lucky?
-Yeah, lucky.

504
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:25,400
That's right.

505
00:59:27,239 --> 00:59:30,159
-You and your god damn heart.
-It was a pretty good heart.

506
00:59:31,159 --> 00:59:34,039
-It was a bad heart. Bad.
-Only there at the end.

507
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:38,280
God, I wish you were
here so I could kill you.

508
00:59:57,159 --> 01:00:00,039
-I can't do this. I can't do this!
-Do what?

509
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:01,599
Living!

510
01:00:05,039 --> 01:00:06,360
Living.

511
01:00:07,159 --> 01:00:08,840
Well, you're doing it, babe.

512
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:18,880
It ain't me, Dave

513
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:23,360
No, no, no It's ain't me, Dave

514
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:26,719
It ain't Dave you're looking for, babe

515
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:35,360
Go away from my window

516
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:39,800
Leave at your own chosen speed

517
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:45,719
You say you're looking for someone

518
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:49,920
Who'd never take the last piece of cake

519
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,199
Be right there.

520
01:02:30,159 --> 01:02:33,800
Frenchy, it's your deadbeat dad
coming for the custody dog.

521
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:36,519
Oh, come on, baby.

522
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:42,199
Oh god!

523
01:02:43,719 --> 01:02:46,039
Baby Jane, what happened to you?

524
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,360
Okay.

525
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:08,639
-Hey, Claire. How are you doing?
-Great.

526
01:03:09,719 --> 01:03:13,480
Frenchy no longer eats dog food.
There's chicken and beef in the bag.

527
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:18,119
Don't judge, Brian. He's old.
You like your comforts.

528
01:03:19,199 --> 01:03:21,760
-Where's your mask?
-It's in the car.

529
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:25,840
-I put it on when I go in the stores.
-Are you sure?

530
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:28,280
Because every time
I go into the supermarket

531
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:31,360
and there's someone going cluelessly
down the wrong aisle,

532
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:35,440
it's usually a guy not wearing a mask,
who thinks he's invulnerable.

533
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:38,599
Well, I don't
think I'm invulnerable.

534
01:03:38,679 --> 01:03:40,800
Good,
because you're not.

535
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:43,159
-Bye.
-Bye, Frenchy.

536
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:46,360
Remember our signal.
I'll know if you don't get your treats.

537
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:50,559
It's my allergies.

538
01:03:51,239 --> 01:03:52,800
-I don't have it.
-I know.

539
01:03:54,239 --> 01:03:56,000
Shut up, shut up, shut up.

540
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:07,519
Hello.

541
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:10,320
Hello, my baby.

542
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:22,400
Hello, my darling.

543
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:25,039
How are you?

544
01:04:29,719 --> 01:04:31,079
Now what?

545
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:38,519
He was howling in the car.
I'd never heard him do that.

546
01:04:38,599 --> 01:04:42,199
-And I had to turn around.
-Oh, my God. Are you okay, Frenchy?

547
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,480
-Oh, my God.
-I don't know.

548
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:46,599
Howling?

549
01:04:46,679 --> 01:04:49,320
Well, he was now, and then he
was whimpering after that, so...

550
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:51,719
Oh, my God.

551
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:54,559
I'll stay?

552
01:04:54,639 --> 01:04:57,079
-If it's okay? If you think so?
-Okay, okay.

553
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:58,719
-Just in case.
-Yeah, yeah.

554
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:01,400
-Come in.
-Yeah, yeah.

555
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:05,119
Yo, why don't you stay
overnight until we know he's okay.

556
01:05:20,519 --> 01:05:23,159
What are you doing up? You're never up
this early unless you're on a job.

557
01:05:23,239 --> 01:05:26,719
Honey, does that turkey wake you up
every morning at 06:00 a.m.?

558
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:28,840
He's needy.

559
01:05:29,719 --> 01:05:31,960
He's seeing his
reflection in the window.

560
01:05:32,039 --> 01:05:35,639
He's beating his head against
the window thinking it's another turkey.

561
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:40,599
He runs toward me every morning
like we're in a romance novel

562
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:44,920
and I've come back from another
century to be his and his alone.

563
01:05:47,679 --> 01:05:49,800
You're watching
a lot of Outlander, huh?

564
01:05:50,599 --> 01:05:51,960
No.

565
01:05:55,599 --> 01:05:59,519
I think I have some wooden shutters
in the shed I could put up for you

566
01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:03,239
and then he'd stop banging his head...

567
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:06,440
Because it's impossible
to think that I'd be his lover, right?

568
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:09,599
It's impossible to think that
I'd be anybody's lover.

569
01:06:09,679 --> 01:06:13,239
I'm just saying I could put up some
shutters so you could sleep in.

570
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:15,760
Okay.

571
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:25,199
Let's hear the death count
for today.

572
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:27,639
...confirmed cases in the US now.

573
01:06:27,719 --> 01:06:30,039
It's still the
sound thing bugging you, huh?

574
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:33,000
It's called "misophonia"
and it's a real thing.

575
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:37,400
It was pretty real to me.

576
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:39,400
Oh, you believe it now?

577
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,079
You said
it was all in my head.

578
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:45,719
In America, here are
millions of dogs left in the cold.

579
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:48,199
Sad dogs! Dogs in cages!
Give me the remote!

580
01:06:48,519 --> 01:06:51,679
-You got the remote.
-Oh, mute, mute, mute.

581
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:58,639
I'm gonna go take a look
in the shed

582
01:06:58,719 --> 01:07:00,800
and look for those wooden shutters.

583
01:07:04,639 --> 01:07:08,119
I have antihistamines.
You don't have to suffer!

584
01:07:10,199 --> 01:07:11,559
So I don't have to suffer.

585
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:18,159
Brian.

586
01:07:23,559 --> 01:07:25,960
-Nice idea.
-We shouldn't be smoking, though.

587
01:07:26,039 --> 01:07:28,679
I've got edibles, I've got edibles.
Over there.

588
01:07:31,239 --> 01:07:33,119
Smells so good.

589
01:07:33,639 --> 01:07:35,880
Good harvest?
Abbondanza.

590
01:07:36,679 --> 01:07:38,239
-Let me show you.
-Let me see.

591
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,960
Smells so good, my God.

592
01:07:46,039 --> 01:07:47,679
Abbondanza!

593
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:53,840
I gotta... I'm sorry.
I gotta see this guy.

594
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:01,199
Well, I think it's important for people
to understand how the data comes in.

595
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:03,239
A lot of the data that
we're posting today,

596
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:06,239
the testing or the fatality
may have happened

597
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:08,039
you know, five or six days ago.

598
01:08:08,119 --> 01:08:09,480
Stupid.

599
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:11,679
What are you doin'?

600
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:15,599
Spelling Bee. It's a word puzzle.
I'm addicted.

601
01:08:18,439 --> 01:08:20,199
-I wanna play.
-Yeah?

602
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:22,199
Get a paper and pen.

603
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:30,800
-What's this? A new puzzle?
-Yeah.

604
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:39,000
So would "Ramen" be a word?

605
01:08:39,079 --> 01:08:41,079
No, I told you, no proper names.

606
01:08:41,159 --> 01:08:43,920
-And anyway, there's an E.
-Shit!

607
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:48,680
-How many do you have?
-I'm two points short of genius.

608
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:53,880
-Well, let me see what you have.
-No, not yet! No.

609
01:08:55,039 --> 01:08:57,199
I'm gonna make some tea.
You want some?

610
01:08:58,119 --> 01:08:59,760
-No, thanks.
-What did you do?

611
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:04,319
Nice passive-aggressive
move there, buddy.

612
01:09:06,359 --> 01:09:08,039
And I always
liked that about you.

613
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,840
Well, because you are, too.
Just because you can spell.

614
01:09:12,199 --> 01:09:13,479
I can make spells, too.

615
01:09:14,079 --> 01:09:16,439
Remember when you were
scared of me, because of my...

616
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:20,000
Because of my double-jointed thumbs?
You thought I was a witch.

617
01:09:20,079 --> 01:09:22,319
-And you remember when you...
-Don't even.

618
01:09:24,079 --> 01:09:26,800
Jesus, come on, this is...
this is almost genius.

619
01:09:27,479 --> 01:09:28,920
I put a spell on you.

620
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:38,239
-Is it okay?
-I'm gonna head to bed.

621
01:09:41,399 --> 01:09:43,199
I got ask you a question.

622
01:09:45,159 --> 01:09:50,359
How come these nuts drive you crazy
but the turkey gobble sounds don't?

623
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:53,039
I don't know.

624
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:55,880
I don't know.

625
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:57,880
Oh, man.

626
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:01,520
-You drive me nuts!
-I drive myself nuts!

627
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:06,880
Goodnight.

628
01:10:11,159 --> 01:10:12,239
Goodnight.

629
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:21,279
Come, my darlings, come.

630
01:10:24,439 --> 01:10:25,760
Come on.

631
01:10:34,279 --> 01:10:36,680
Your turkey
husband sounds happy today.

632
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,399
-You're jealous of a turkey now?
-No, I am not.

633
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:45,880
But I think Frenchy is.

634
01:10:48,199 --> 01:10:49,760
-Frenchy.
-Yeah.

635
01:10:55,079 --> 01:10:57,680
You know, I think Frenchy's
happier with me here.

636
01:11:00,039 --> 01:11:01,520
Yeah?

637
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:10,119
Maybe we should try to
watch something else.

638
01:11:12,039 --> 01:11:15,279
I'm beyond depressed looking
at these death counts

639
01:11:15,359 --> 01:11:18,960
and social distancing for those
lucky enough to still be alive.

640
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:22,960
You wanna play
that word game again?

641
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:26,439
I don't know.
You gonna scribble on my hand again?

642
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:28,000
I don't know. I might.

643
01:11:29,319 --> 01:11:30,920
Okay,
I'll set up the computer.

644
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:37,399
You can do four letter words.
Proper names are still not allowed.

645
01:11:37,479 --> 01:11:39,239
No eating nuts!

646
01:11:39,319 --> 01:11:42,000
Oh, see, that's...
that's what I wanna talk to you about.

647
01:11:42,319 --> 01:11:44,079
-Nuts?
-Yeah, social distancing.

648
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:49,079
Look, I think we like each other enough

649
01:11:49,159 --> 01:11:53,159
to socially distance while
I'm eating any loud food.

650
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:57,720
If I'm eating nuts or an apple, okay?
Or any loud food.

651
01:11:58,039 --> 01:12:00,960
What if I said,
"I'll make a pact with you

652
01:12:01,039 --> 01:12:03,520
to socially distance for loud food"?

653
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:07,000
If I eat an apple,
I'll stand over here.

654
01:12:07,479 --> 01:12:09,119
And nuts, anything.

655
01:12:10,119 --> 01:12:13,520
Otherwise, Claire...

656
01:12:24,079 --> 01:12:25,439
Pact?

657
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:34,520
-One more thing to seal the deal.
-What?

658
01:12:37,439 --> 01:12:38,920
We unplug.

659
01:12:40,439 --> 01:12:41,640
We unplug.

660
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:41,680
TWENTY QUESTIONS

661
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:01,199
What I've learned is just how isolated
I was before all this happened.

662
01:14:02,119 --> 01:14:03,680
I love the quiet.

663
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:05,479
I love being with my own thoughts,

664
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:08,439
keeping my own counsel,
not racing around.

665
01:14:09,239 --> 01:14:11,520
I have so much time.

666
01:14:12,279 --> 01:14:14,000
It's such a relief.

667
01:14:14,079 --> 01:14:16,720
What was I rushing around for before?
There's nothing to do.

668
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:21,079
I owe my mother a call.
It's been weeks and she's all alone.

669
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:30,720
Loneliness is the central
and inevitable fact of human existence.

670
01:14:43,439 --> 01:14:48,840
Title loneliness is the central
and inevitable factor of human existence.

671
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:57,000
Someone's at my door.
Who is it?

672
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:00,239
It's the mailman.

673
01:15:00,319 --> 01:15:02,640
He's a nice, simple guy
with a crush on me.

674
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:06,239
Talks to me about World
Cup soccer sometimes.

675
01:15:06,319 --> 01:15:09,560
Maybe I could ask him in for a coffee,
take things from there.

676
01:15:10,159 --> 01:15:12,319
Would I feel guilty if everyone's
packages were late

677
01:15:12,399 --> 01:15:15,119
because I started a torrid affair
with the mailman?

678
01:15:15,199 --> 01:15:17,600
It could be awkward if
it didn't go well.

679
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:27,239
My mind was
always racing before.

680
01:15:28,399 --> 01:15:30,000
So many deadlines.

681
01:15:31,479 --> 01:15:33,319
Now it's calm.

682
01:15:36,399 --> 01:15:38,880
It's because of the amount
of sleep I've been getting.

683
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:42,079
Not setting the alarm in the morning
is the greatest gift.

684
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:50,920
I should have gotten a dog.
Even a rescue dog.

685
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:53,720
But some of them are so crazy,

686
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:55,760
like that lady that comes
by the public pool

687
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:59,119
with that dog that barks at anyone
who tries to swim. What a nightmare!

688
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:01,159
I'm so horny.

689
01:16:01,239 --> 01:16:03,960
I shouldn't have broken
up with my boyfriend before all this.

690
01:16:04,039 --> 01:16:05,640
I blame myself.

691
01:16:06,319 --> 01:16:08,079
I miss my housekeeper.

692
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:11,159
I wish something would happen.

693
01:17:47,319 --> 01:17:49,079
I killed two people today.

694
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:51,319
One more makes zero difference.

695
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:54,199
Don't scream.

696
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:15,000
...issued a stern warning to neighbors
in the immediate vicinity of Green Valley

697
01:18:15,439 --> 01:18:19,960
to be on high alert and on the lookout
for escaped inmate Paula Mariah Roback,

698
01:18:20,359 --> 01:18:23,479
who is unstable, violent,
and extremely dangerous.

699
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:25,840
Sheriff Prosky begged
the people not to try

700
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:29,560
and take matters into their own hands,
but rather call the office immediately,

701
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:32,960
so they can apprehend the suspect
without further bloodshed.

702
01:18:33,039 --> 01:18:36,880
Paula Mariah Roback has a long and
terrifying history of mental illness...

703
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:39,840
Harkening
back to her early teens...

704
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,760
You call me that and I'll hurt you.
Understand?

705
01:18:55,039 --> 01:18:57,760
My mother was a tone-deaf
hoebag with no taste.

706
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:01,119
Couldn't decide who she liked better,
Paula Abdul or Mariah Carey.

707
01:19:01,199 --> 01:19:03,279
So, I was stuck with a shit childhood

708
01:19:03,359 --> 01:19:07,000
and learned to mop up the floor with
lippy bitches before I learned to read.

709
01:19:07,079 --> 01:19:09,439
Came up with my own brand
of Super Karate.

710
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:14,199
My whole life, I've been fighting,
so that's what my identity's based on.

711
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:17,079
That's what the nice lady shrink
keeps reminding me.

712
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:25,159
What's your name?

713
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:27,880
Leslie?

714
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,359
Ivy.

715
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:33,079
-Are you gonna scream again?
-No.

716
01:19:33,159 --> 01:19:34,479
-You lying?
-No.

717
01:19:41,079 --> 01:19:42,399
Well?

718
01:19:43,039 --> 01:19:44,359
What?

719
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:47,079
What's your name?

720
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:50,680
-Ivy.
-That's your Christian name?

721
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:53,479
-No.
-What'd your parents call you?

722
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:58,600
-Yvonne.
-What I mean right there.

723
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:01,000
Yvonne sounds like a brand of tampon.

724
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:04,079
School was no walk
in the park for you, I bet.

725
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:07,399
I borrowed your dress.

726
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:10,000
Smells really good.

727
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:24,960
The only good thing
to come out of all this

728
01:20:25,039 --> 01:20:26,760
is that you can go anywhere
wearing a mask

729
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:28,880
and nobody knows you're there
to rob 'em till the last second.

730
01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:31,119
That's the only thing I'm gonna miss.

731
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:35,399
You know gun shops are on
the essential list now? Sex shops, too.

732
01:20:36,399 --> 01:20:38,560
Someone has their priorities straight.

733
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:40,760
Do you have a gun?

734
01:20:41,439 --> 01:20:44,119
What am I asking? Of course, you don't.
If you had a gun,

735
01:20:44,199 --> 01:20:46,720
you wouldn't have faced an intruder
with an umbrella.

736
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:53,520
How was that supposed to work?

737
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:56,880
Were you gonna stick the umbrella
up the guy's ass and press the button,

738
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:58,760
hoping it'd open and paralyzed him?

739
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:04,560
I wasn't... thinking.

740
01:21:05,279 --> 01:21:06,600
No kidding.

741
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:12,920
A little home
protection goes a long way.

742
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:28,720
You can't keep
me tied up like this.

743
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:31,119
-People will come looking for me.
-What people?

744
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:35,199
People. Because you're alone in the world
doesn't mean I don't have any friends.

745
01:21:36,119 --> 01:21:38,159
You don't have
to be a dick about it.

746
01:21:38,239 --> 01:21:40,720
My arms are numb.
I can't feel my wrists.

747
01:21:41,279 --> 01:21:43,319
I have no blood circulation.

748
01:21:44,199 --> 01:21:45,600
I get sad when it rains.

749
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:49,840
Having a rough life is no excuse
to go around terrorizing people.

750
01:21:50,720 --> 01:21:52,600
What do you know about rough?

751
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:56,119
-There's a lot you don't know about me.
-Like what? One thing.

752
01:22:00,119 --> 01:22:02,960
-Were you raised dirt poor on a farm?
-What if I was?

753
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:05,439
So was I.

754
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:07,960
Did your mother die in a gruesome
tractor accident

755
01:22:08,039 --> 01:22:11,159
with your dad behind the wheel,
because they were both drunk?

756
01:22:12,479 --> 01:22:16,600
Did your one-armed uncle smuggle
cigarettes and moonshine on a speed boat?

757
01:22:17,479 --> 01:22:19,199
There was
a speed boat in a farm?

758
01:22:20,039 --> 01:22:21,680
The farm was next to a lake.

759
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:26,000
It's like they say,
truth is stranger than fiction.

760
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:28,640
Huh, come on.
Don't give me that.

761
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:30,800
Of course, truth is stranger
than fiction.

762
01:22:32,119 --> 01:22:33,560
Fiction has to make sense.

763
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:37,560
I'm not here
for your entertainment.

764
01:22:38,079 --> 01:22:39,600
Stay focused.

765
01:23:12,159 --> 01:23:14,439
I'm so sorry that took
longer than I meant.

766
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:16,239
Oh my God.
Are you alright?

767
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:27,359
I am so sorry.

768
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:32,439
I know what it feels to be left betrayed,
abandoned, and humiliated.

769
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:36,520
When I was 12, I was abducted by
a white supremacist biker gang

770
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:38,279
of Satan worshippers.

771
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:41,880
The nice lady shrink says all my trauma
stemmed from that moment.

772
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:45,159
The fabric of my reality
was torn or something.

773
01:23:45,239 --> 01:23:47,560
They meant to use me
in a blood sacrifice ritual,

774
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:50,279
and tied me up to this makeshift altar,

775
01:23:50,359 --> 01:23:53,479
and lit this big bonfire where
they intended to cook me.

776
01:23:55,159 --> 01:24:00,239
I remember trembling, my whole body
just vibrating, almost levitating.

777
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:04,880
And I suppose I went into a trance.

778
01:24:06,439 --> 01:24:10,279
My mind went blank
and focused on one simple thought.

779
01:24:11,439 --> 01:24:13,800
Complete and total annihilation.

780
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:18,159
This staggering feat of derring-do,

781
01:24:18,239 --> 01:24:20,960
one shell-shocked 12-year-old versus
five twisted and depraved

782
01:24:21,039 --> 01:24:23,399
white supremacist Satan worshippers

783
01:24:23,479 --> 01:24:27,840
was reported on the news by a nasty
blonde bitch who never quit smiling

784
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:30,000
as she described the way I massacred,

785
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:34,359
with my bare little hands,
those evil bikers.

786
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:38,439
Which is why I can't stand the news.

787
01:24:40,520 --> 01:24:42,159
Or Nazis.

788
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:44,399
Or heavy metal bands.

789
01:24:45,239 --> 01:24:47,000
Or motorcycles.

790
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:50,840
Which is why I broke your TV.

791
01:24:52,239 --> 01:24:53,720
I'm sorry for that.

792
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:37,920
I gotta say, most women don't
look great in that, but you do.

793
01:25:39,399 --> 01:25:42,039
Seriously.
Plus, you have amazing boobs.

794
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:46,760
Come on, have you never wanted
to be somebody's love slave?

795
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,680
All women like a little rough trade
from time to time.

796
01:25:53,359 --> 01:25:55,359
We're all getting a little testy.

797
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:59,920
Oh, boy, I'm sweating
like a nun in a cucumber field.

798
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:04,640
You wanna play 20 questions with me?

799
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:09,359
Who's that?

800
01:26:16,479 --> 01:26:19,000
-Who is that?
-The mailman?

801
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:23,520
-Why is he knocking on your door?
-He must need something signed.

802
01:26:26,039 --> 01:26:27,439
-Hey.
-Hey there.

803
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:28,840
I don't mean to bother you,

804
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:32,199
but did I drop off a package
for 513 here yesterday by mistake?

805
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:34,840
No.

806
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:39,199
Also, I know you get this all the time,
but I'm a huge fan of your work.

807
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:43,880
Help me.

808
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:47,119
Excuse me?

809
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:50,760
I need help.

810
01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:52,159
Thanks so much.

811
01:27:10,720 --> 01:27:12,479
You shouldn't have done that.

812
01:27:13,199 --> 01:27:14,840
What do you think I did?

813
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:16,479
Something funny.

814
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:19,359
-Did you do something funny?
-No.

815
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:23,760
-Were you a bad little bunny, Yvonne?
-No.

816
01:27:25,319 --> 01:27:27,239
Did you maybe
ask the mailman for help?

817
01:27:29,039 --> 01:27:30,319
No.

818
01:27:42,680 --> 01:27:44,319
I wasn't born yesterday.

819
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,319
I'm a little lost.

820
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:23,600
I don't understand the things
happening around me.

821
01:28:23,680 --> 01:28:28,119
I have experience, but little wisdom.
This in itself is not unheard of.

822
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:31,439
I've been told this is
a sign of the times,

823
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:35,680
a by-product of the hostile
world we live in, a world adrift.

824
01:28:36,720 --> 01:28:38,680
It doesn't make me feel
better about it.

825
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:40,880
I don't wanna give up yet.

826
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:42,880
Even if no one sings me love songs.

827
01:28:43,399 --> 01:28:46,640
Even if I don't yet have a convincing
beginning for my new novel.

828
01:29:16,840 --> 01:29:19,720
I want to live.
I want to bloom like a flower.

829
01:29:20,680 --> 01:29:22,399
And touch other people.

830
01:29:22,760 --> 01:29:24,199
Strangers.

831
01:29:24,279 --> 01:29:30,000
Touch their faces, and their hands,
and hug them dangerously tight.

832
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:37,760
LONLINESS IS THE CENTRAL AND
INEVITABLE FACT OF HUMAN EXISTENCE.

833
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:56,560
I KILLED TWO PEOPLE TODAY,
ONE MORE MAKES ZERO DIFFERENCE.

834
01:29:57,640 --> 01:29:59,039
DON'T SCREAM.

835
01:31:30,760 --> 01:31:32,319
This feels special.

836
01:31:42,399 --> 01:31:44,239
We should do it more often.

837
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:51,920
Is it?

838
01:31:52,760 --> 01:31:53,960
It is to me.

839
01:31:57,319 --> 01:31:58,920
I'd like to do it more often.

840
01:32:01,079 --> 01:32:02,359
Me, too.

841
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:04,560
So nice without screens.

842
01:32:15,279 --> 01:32:17,079
That reminds me...

843
01:32:17,159 --> 01:32:20,439
TOUCHING

844
01:32:23,119 --> 01:32:24,880
...I have a Zoom at 7:00.

845
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,239
I should just...

846
01:32:29,199 --> 01:32:31,520
-Check if people have replied.
-Can we not?

847
01:32:32,079 --> 01:32:34,199
Can we just carry on with this?

848
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:36,479
You know, the specialness?

849
01:32:38,319 --> 01:32:40,039
-While it's still...
-Special?

850
01:32:43,319 --> 01:32:44,680
Right.

851
01:33:01,039 --> 01:33:03,439
-Can you not do that?
-What?

852
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:05,600
-With your foot.
-I was here first.

853
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:08,199
-What difference does that make?
-So I can move my foot where I like.

854
01:33:08,279 --> 01:33:10,119
Not if I'm here now.
I'm here now

855
01:33:10,199 --> 01:33:12,159
and I don't want your foot
invading my space.

856
01:33:12,239 --> 01:33:14,039
But it was
my space before you came.

857
01:33:14,119 --> 01:33:18,439
I had all of this space.
Then you occupied it and took my space

858
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:20,479
that I had saved for moving
my foot into.

859
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:22,720
-You sound like Israel.
-Can you please move it?

860
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:24,680
Or maybe it's Palestine.

861
01:33:25,960 --> 01:33:28,600
Maybe it's Palestine. It feels
like it was originally their space.

862
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:30,319
You have to share the space.

863
01:33:30,399 --> 01:33:32,119
-Says the UN.
-Please move it.

864
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:41,279
-Your nails are so sharp! Israel!
-No, you're Israel!

865
01:33:41,359 --> 01:33:44,279
-I thought you said I was Palestine!
-Can you please just both stop?

866
01:33:45,079 --> 01:33:46,640
This was special.

867
01:33:46,720 --> 01:33:49,359
Can we just keep it that way
for a minute before we start...

868
01:33:51,199 --> 01:33:54,039
-Invading each other or...
-Take up more space than we need.

869
01:33:54,439 --> 01:33:56,960
Or start coming in and taking
over perfectly happy people.

870
01:33:57,479 --> 01:33:58,920
-Dad?
-Please, both of you.

871
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
Can we not just all...

872
01:34:05,319 --> 01:34:08,239
Try and find a two-cushion
solution, please.

873
01:34:14,159 --> 01:34:15,520
Dad?

874
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:20,359
-Dad?
-Yes! What? I'm right here!

875
01:34:21,159 --> 01:34:22,159
Is she Israel?

876
01:34:22,239 --> 01:34:24,640
If you got something to ask, you don't
always need to keep saying "dad".

877
01:34:24,720 --> 01:34:27,680
You have my attention just by talking,
without always...

878
01:34:35,359 --> 01:34:36,560
Dad?

879
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:39,520
Sorry, I did not mean to do that.

880
01:34:40,079 --> 01:34:41,600
Say "dad", I mean.

881
01:34:42,319 --> 01:34:43,720
Oh, be quiet.

882
01:34:49,399 --> 01:34:52,399
Dad, sorry, is she
Israel if I was here first?

883
01:34:52,479 --> 01:34:55,119
-Stop calling me "Israel"!
-You don't even know what it means!

884
01:34:55,199 --> 01:34:57,640
-It means that I was there!
-Just a stupid... quiet!

885
01:34:59,359 --> 01:35:01,479
-Stop it, stop it!
-Stop antagonizing.

886
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:04,560
-I want to learn!
-You scratched me again!

887
01:35:06,159 --> 01:35:08,479
You space-invading poo puncher!

888
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:10,800
Okay, okay,
you come over here.

889
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:12,920
-Why do I have to move?
-Just please come here.

890
01:35:28,159 --> 01:35:29,640
Daddy?

891
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:33,000
-Am I Israel?
-No.

892
01:35:34,640 --> 01:35:36,039
Honestly, I don't know.

893
01:35:36,119 --> 01:35:39,640
-She can say "daddy" but I can't.
-Can you stop please?

894
01:35:43,279 --> 01:35:46,520
No, I think I got myself
in a bit of muddle with this one.

895
01:35:50,279 --> 01:35:55,840
I think both Israel and Palestine think
that they were there first.

896
01:35:58,319 --> 01:35:59,680
I think.

897
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:05,600
You okay? You okay, mum?

898
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:08,800
-It's pretty complicated.
-I'm sorry.

899
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:16,720
-It's not you.
-Oh, love.

900
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:25,199
Darlin'.

901
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:36,840
I was just reading this beautiful thing
about someone dying alone.

902
01:36:40,039 --> 01:36:42,680
Their family isn't allowed
to be with them and...

903
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:49,199
I just got scared for that ever
happening to us, to people we love.

904
01:36:57,800 --> 01:36:59,000
To my Dad.

905
01:36:59,479 --> 01:37:01,039
Or Granny.

906
01:37:05,439 --> 01:37:07,359
What about when granny
was a little girl,

907
01:37:07,439 --> 01:37:09,800
all alone in the hospital
with scarlet fever.

908
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:14,239
-What was she, 8?
-6, I think.

909
01:37:15,880 --> 01:37:17,239
Isolated for six months?

910
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:21,000
-I think it was 8.
-Whatever. All that time, on her own!

911
01:37:22,079 --> 01:37:25,119
Her mom and dad waving at her
through a window in the door.

912
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:29,279
Terrified all the time.

913
01:37:33,479 --> 01:37:35,359
And if we ever had to mourn alone...

914
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:39,439
Separately, not together,
I don't think I could take it.

915
01:37:41,399 --> 01:37:44,359
All the things we do when someone
dies we do together.

916
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:49,119
Talk. Drink.

917
01:37:53,039 --> 01:37:55,640
Tell stories.
Hold someone's hand.

918
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:11,520
This is getting a little uncomfortable.
Do you think you could get off?

919
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:13,439
-Sorry, sorry, sorry.
-It's okay.

920
01:38:16,279 --> 01:38:17,640
I've got a great idea!

921
01:38:17,720 --> 01:38:20,920
Hey Siri, play Alexandra
by Hamilton Leithauser.

922
01:38:22,199 --> 01:38:24,000
For old times' sake.

923
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:43,960
That's good.

924
01:40:26,600 --> 01:40:29,560
It's just about science!
Why won't they listen to the science?

925
01:40:34,920 --> 01:40:36,600
Does he really believe that?

926
01:40:37,279 --> 01:40:39,079
Did you hear that?

927
01:40:39,439 --> 01:40:41,720
Oh, it's the Washington death cult!

928
01:40:42,239 --> 01:40:45,199
It's just about science!
Why won't they listen to the science?

929
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:54,159
That's the hospital
where Ben was born.

930
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:56,159
Lousy parking.

931
01:40:59,399 --> 01:41:00,800
Hi, dad.

932
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:06,800
Sorry, the TV's on and Ben's playing
his guitar. You all right?

933
01:41:09,359 --> 01:41:10,720
You should have stayed.

934
01:41:15,920 --> 01:41:17,680
No, dad,
please use your walker.

935
01:41:18,359 --> 01:41:21,119
We wanna come get you,
but you gotta let your hip heal first.

936
01:41:21,199 --> 01:41:24,359
So that means you gotta move every day,
only with your walker and with Kimmy.

937
01:41:24,439 --> 01:41:26,800
Are you seeing this?
They don't even have a plan!

938
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:29,720
If you do that, you're gonna fall again,
and if you fall again...

939
01:41:29,800 --> 01:41:32,159
No, dad, that's why you
can't fire Kimmy.

940
01:41:32,239 --> 01:41:35,239
-Doctors say one thing and then...
-Matt, please.

941
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:38,720
Ben.

942
01:41:40,199 --> 01:41:41,880
That's our home, Ben.

943
01:41:42,239 --> 01:41:43,960
We have to pay attention.

944
01:41:47,359 --> 01:41:49,640
No, dad.
Dad, you're not listening to me.

945
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,880
-If you do that...
-Ben. Ben!

946
01:41:54,640 --> 01:41:57,680
No, dad. No, please.
Hang on a second.

947
01:41:57,760 --> 01:41:59,840
We should go
with him, he might get lost.

948
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:02,039
I'll call you
back after your nap, dad.

949
01:42:11,439 --> 01:42:13,319
-He's pissed, isn't he?
-So am I.

950
01:42:14,399 --> 01:42:16,119
I hate it here.

951
01:42:16,199 --> 01:42:18,439
Coyotes, at night, freaked me out.

952
01:42:19,319 --> 01:42:22,039
My dad's gonna fall again.
Where is he going?

953
01:42:22,760 --> 01:42:25,319
I don't know.
Maybe he's walking back to the city.

954
01:42:26,680 --> 01:42:30,560
My back is killing me. I think the
mattress in that place is from the 1950s.

955
01:42:30,640 --> 01:42:31,640
Stop complaining.

956
01:42:31,720 --> 01:42:33,760
I think the plumbing
is from the '50s, too.

957
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:37,319
-Do you think Ben seems anxious?
-No, he seems pissed.

958
01:42:37,640 --> 01:42:41,199
-You're the one that seems anxious.
-Well, I am anxious about my dad.

959
01:42:41,279 --> 01:42:43,920
-Kimmy says his feet are getting worse.
-Then go back, you can see your dad.

960
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,079
I don't wanna go back.
How could we use the elevator?

961
01:42:46,159 --> 01:42:48,720
How can Ben see his friends? You know
he's gonna wanna see his friends.

962
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:50,720
-You wanna open that Pandora's Box?
-But your dad.

963
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:53,319
Don't use my guilt about my dad
to get me to go back right now.

964
01:42:53,399 --> 01:42:56,079
-That is not fair.
-Don't be so defensive.

965
01:42:56,159 --> 01:42:59,159
-I'm not being defensive!
-Look, we can't stay here forever.

966
01:42:59,239 --> 01:43:02,520
Henry's gonna start charging us rent
as soon as the state reopens.

967
01:43:02,600 --> 01:43:04,600
-He's doing us a favor.
-So we pay it.

968
01:43:04,680 --> 01:43:07,399
Are you kidding me?
We can barely afford our rent back home.

969
01:43:08,119 --> 01:43:10,439
We need to start
getting better about food.

970
01:43:13,119 --> 01:43:15,920
What? His teeth are hurting,
he broke his braces.

971
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,119
-I know that.
-So I'll take him back to the city.

972
01:43:18,199 --> 01:43:20,159
And then the orthodontist sticks
his hands in his mouth?

973
01:43:20,239 --> 01:43:21,760
Do you know how unsafe that is?

974
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:25,039
We spent a lot of money on those braces.
We can't start over again.

975
01:43:25,119 --> 01:43:27,039
Why do you keep
making this all about money?

976
01:43:27,119 --> 01:43:28,920
Why won't you
acknowledge that it's an issue?

977
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,039
If you'd have taken
that transfer six months ago,

978
01:43:31,119 --> 01:43:32,680
you wouldn't have been
laid off right now.

979
01:43:32,760 --> 01:43:34,840
How could I see that the world
was about to implode.

980
01:43:34,920 --> 01:43:36,960
It's an emergency, it's his health.
Like your dad.

981
01:43:37,039 --> 01:43:39,479
-So I'll take him alone.
-And then we're separated?

982
01:43:41,399 --> 01:43:42,640
No.

983
01:43:42,720 --> 01:43:44,960
Ben, you have to tell us
how bad your teeth...

984
01:43:47,720 --> 01:43:48,880
Where is he?

985
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:51,159
Ben!

986
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:53,199
Ben?

987
01:43:55,319 --> 01:43:56,600
Ben!

988
01:44:02,600 --> 01:44:03,840
I'm right here.

989
01:44:07,079 --> 01:44:08,479
Ben!

990
01:44:16,159 --> 01:44:17,319
We get too loud?

991
01:44:19,439 --> 01:44:21,079
Now you please be quiet.

992
01:47:38,119 --> 01:47:39,880
Can you show me the way home?

993
01:47:51,560 --> 01:47:54,279
Dad.
Dad, please use your walker.

994
01:47:54,840 --> 01:47:58,159
Have you seen this thing?
They even have no beds!

995
01:48:11,960 --> 01:48:16,279
IN THE AIR

996
01:48:57,720 --> 01:49:00,560
As the domestic
death count exceeds 34,000,

997
01:49:00,640 --> 01:49:02,399
the disaster in nursing homes,

998
01:49:02,479 --> 01:49:05,159
the tip that led law enforcement
to 18 bodies

999
01:49:05,239 --> 01:49:07,239
at one facility's tiny mooring,

1000
01:49:07,319 --> 01:49:10,880
more than 5,600 residents dead across
the US, families begging for...

1001
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:13,199
SHELL GAME

1002
01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:16,399
-Do you think he's coming back?
-I have no idea.

1003
01:49:19,560 --> 01:49:22,439
I've been thinking a lot
about what you told me.

1004
01:49:22,840 --> 01:49:25,920
How like attracts like
and how the frequency

1005
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:29,079
that you put out in the world
is what comes back at you.

1006
01:49:29,479 --> 01:49:31,920
I mean oh my God.
That's disturbing!

1007
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:33,960
I mean this guy's the most
selfish asshole I've ever met.

1008
01:49:34,039 --> 01:49:35,840
What does that say about me?

1009
01:49:36,319 --> 01:49:39,680
You know me. I just have this thing
where I need to fix people. I'm a fixer.

1010
01:49:40,520 --> 01:49:44,199
I don't know. I see a fucked up guy and I
have this crazy impulse to make him eggs.

1011
01:49:44,720 --> 01:49:46,479
Do you think Lester's gonna come back?

1012
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:48,600
Don't answer.
I don't care, I give a shit.

1013
01:49:48,680 --> 01:49:52,119
He shouldn't come back. I don't care.
The guy is driving me crazy, clearly,

1014
01:49:52,199 --> 01:49:54,520
and it's just there's
so much uncertainty in the world.

1015
01:49:54,600 --> 01:49:56,920
Why do I even want him back here?
I don't know.

1016
01:49:57,600 --> 01:50:00,880
It's like there's some fucking invisible
cosmic noose wrapped around my neck,

1017
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:03,359
pulling me towards some sort
of form of punishment

1018
01:50:03,439 --> 01:50:05,760
or some sort of torture
or something and...

1019
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,600
I sound like I'm a masochist, right?

1020
01:50:11,119 --> 01:50:12,960
We've established that.

1021
01:50:13,560 --> 01:50:16,039
I mean you don't think
I'm a masochist, do you?

1022
01:50:16,520 --> 01:50:18,760
Oh no! I mean you seem to avoid
pain at all costs.

1023
01:50:19,119 --> 01:50:21,000
Right. Exactly.

1024
01:50:22,680 --> 01:50:25,520
I mean I don't understand why I'm
staying with this guy.

1025
01:50:26,119 --> 01:50:27,520
Why do I keep going back to him?

1026
01:50:27,600 --> 01:50:31,159
It's like why be with someone who doesn't
treat me the way I deserve to be treated?

1027
01:50:34,520 --> 01:50:39,279
It's the age-old question right behind,
"Why are we here?"

1028
01:50:40,479 --> 01:50:42,520
"What is our purpose in life?"

1029
01:50:45,199 --> 01:50:46,840
Why do I stay with this guy?

1030
01:50:51,560 --> 01:50:55,359
Oh my God, I sound like such a cliche.
Really, I mean this is embarrassing.

1031
01:50:56,159 --> 01:50:57,479
You tell me to be authentic.

1032
01:50:57,560 --> 01:51:00,399
You say I could say absolutely
anything I want to, so here you go.

1033
01:51:00,920 --> 01:51:03,600
But really, truly, I mean honestly,
I just... I feel ashamed.

1034
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:05,600
I should be so much further along
than I am right now.

1035
01:51:05,680 --> 01:51:07,079
Don't be so hard on yourself.

1036
01:51:09,199 --> 01:51:11,920
Oh my God!
Did I tell you about Saskatchewan?

1037
01:51:13,239 --> 01:51:16,479
I can't believe I didn't tell you this.
Oh, but this is exactly...

1038
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,439
Okay, remember I was in Saskatchewan

1039
01:51:19,520 --> 01:51:21,920
right before this whole lock
down thing happened?

1040
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:26,960
Well, I went to the Museum of
um, Natural history uh,

1041
01:51:27,039 --> 01:51:29,119
or Science or Archeology, I don't know.

1042
01:51:29,199 --> 01:51:31,640
It was the only place that
was open on a Sunday.

1043
01:51:31,720 --> 01:51:34,000
And so I go there, and I have
to tell you like all week long,

1044
01:51:34,079 --> 01:51:36,680
I was kind of freaking out,
because that memory of my sister,

1045
01:51:36,760 --> 01:51:38,640
remember the one that I'm like
pounding on the door,

1046
01:51:38,720 --> 01:51:41,279
and pounding on the door, pounding
on the door, like, "Let me in."

1047
01:51:41,359 --> 01:51:44,319
Like, "Let me in, let me in!"
And she's not letting me in and...

1048
01:51:44,680 --> 01:51:47,840
Listen I know we've been through
this ad nauseam. Like I get it.

1049
01:51:47,920 --> 01:51:49,239
She's not letting me in.

1050
01:51:49,319 --> 01:51:51,960
It's like the way this you know,
fuck face isn't letting me in

1051
01:51:52,039 --> 01:51:54,359
and I'm, "Why do I need
someone to let me in?

1052
01:51:55,079 --> 01:51:56,840
Why can't I let myself in?"

1053
01:51:58,800 --> 01:52:02,960
I mean sure she locks the door,
but why don't I just have a key?

1054
01:52:03,479 --> 01:52:05,520
If I have a key, I could let myself in.

1055
01:52:06,560 --> 01:52:10,319
Anyway, so inside the building...
inside the building,

1056
01:52:10,399 --> 01:52:12,960
there was a giant kaleidoscope, okay?

1057
01:52:13,359 --> 01:52:17,319
And like you like kinda
walk in and then under,

1058
01:52:17,399 --> 01:52:19,720
and then you're inside
the kaleidoscope,

1059
01:52:20,079 --> 01:52:23,920
like surrounded by all these shattered
lights, all these fractured mirrors.

1060
01:52:24,279 --> 01:52:26,600
And somehow, when I went in there,

1061
01:52:26,680 --> 01:52:29,680
like it hit... like it
hit me really hard.

1062
01:52:29,760 --> 01:52:34,279
I was weeping. I mean it felt so real
that I could feel how tense I was.

1063
01:52:34,680 --> 01:52:37,720
You know, how desperate I was
to gettin' to the door.

1064
01:52:37,800 --> 01:52:39,920
And as I'm pounding on the
door and my sister like,

1065
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,079
"Let me in!" it hit me so hard.
I mean I don't know.

1066
01:52:42,159 --> 01:52:43,800
I mean maybe it was the mushrooms,

1067
01:52:43,880 --> 01:52:46,079
because I had taken them right
before I got there, but I don't think so.

1068
01:52:46,159 --> 01:52:47,600
You know, it was more than that.

1069
01:52:47,680 --> 01:52:51,079
There was some thing that unlocked
like this little knack, bugging me.

1070
01:52:51,159 --> 01:52:53,000
Why in my subconscious
do I keep thinking

1071
01:52:53,079 --> 01:52:56,439
about this moment that I'm pounding
and pounding, and crying, crying?

1072
01:52:56,760 --> 01:52:59,319
And all of a sudden, I saw
the end of the scene.

1073
01:52:59,399 --> 01:53:02,359
She let me in, but when she let me in,
she's really mean to me.

1074
01:53:02,439 --> 01:53:06,119
She was just like, "Oh, if you come in,
you have to do exactly what I say",

1075
01:53:06,199 --> 01:53:08,399
in this kinda really sadistic
sort of way.

1076
01:53:08,479 --> 01:53:11,159
But if it meant getting into the room,
I had to take it.

1077
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:13,239
I had to take it.

1078
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:17,000
And it just means like love you
know, goes hand in hand

1079
01:53:17,079 --> 01:53:19,640
with bein' treated like shit, I guess.

1080
01:53:21,079 --> 01:53:24,399
She represented love and safety
in a house where no one was home.

1081
01:53:25,239 --> 01:53:28,039
You're scared, and lonely,
and seeking protection.

1082
01:53:28,479 --> 01:53:30,319
You took what was offered.

1083
01:53:30,399 --> 01:53:32,319
That's the seed of your struggle
right there.

1084
01:53:32,399 --> 01:53:34,680
Yeah. Yeah. Exactly.

1085
01:53:36,600 --> 01:53:38,439
It's pretty fucking heavy.

1086
01:53:39,199 --> 01:53:42,000
That's been your pattern.
And now that you know that,

1087
01:53:42,319 --> 01:53:44,119
you don't wanna reinforce the pattern

1088
01:53:44,199 --> 01:53:47,119
by accepting the bad behavior
Les is offering you.

1089
01:53:48,920 --> 01:53:50,000
Right.

1090
01:53:53,760 --> 01:53:55,279
Oh, I totally get this.

1091
01:53:56,720 --> 01:53:59,199
So if he comes back, I should
tell him to leave?

1092
01:54:02,119 --> 01:54:04,000
Oh, I don't want to be alone now.

1093
01:54:04,079 --> 01:54:06,439
Now's not the best time for that.
Who wants that?

1094
01:54:07,199 --> 01:54:09,119
It's scary out there.

1095
01:54:09,199 --> 01:54:13,159
The whole "Ooh, I need some space"
thing, is such bullshit.

1096
01:54:13,960 --> 01:54:16,840
"Oh, it's spring time.
I think I have to wander." Fuck you.

1097
01:54:17,399 --> 01:54:19,560
I mean if he really loved
me, he would stay.

1098
01:54:21,840 --> 01:54:24,199
But if I really loved myself,
I'd ask him to leave.

1099
01:54:24,920 --> 01:54:28,520
-It's a confusing time for everybody.
-The shells were a sign.

1100
01:54:29,319 --> 01:54:30,840
What shells?

1101
01:54:31,319 --> 01:54:33,359
I didn't tell
you about the shells?

1102
01:54:36,880 --> 01:54:38,760
When it was finally okay to go outside,

1103
01:54:38,840 --> 01:54:41,319
we decided to go to the beach you
know, get some fresh air.

1104
01:54:41,399 --> 01:54:45,479
And on the shore,
I found the most amazing open shells.

1105
01:54:45,560 --> 01:54:47,680
They look like these
little butterflies.

1106
01:54:47,760 --> 01:54:49,960
And it seemed like a symbol
of hope or something

1107
01:54:50,039 --> 01:54:53,319
that maybe we've evolved,
turned into something really wonderful.

1108
01:54:55,159 --> 01:54:57,880
But when I looked
at them this morning,

1109
01:54:58,199 --> 01:54:59,680
they'd all broken apart.

1110
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:01,920
Oh, everything feels so
scary to me right now.

1111
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:05,199
I just wanna feel safe, loved.
Is that asking for too much?

1112
01:55:06,560 --> 01:55:08,520
And I know he's been texting his ex.

1113
01:55:08,600 --> 01:55:10,800
-How do you know that?
-Because I heard her ding.

1114
01:55:11,720 --> 01:55:13,560
I know. I could
tell her ding anywhere.

1115
01:55:13,640 --> 01:55:16,079
I mean her ding lingers
like bad perfume.

1116
01:55:16,159 --> 01:55:19,039
Oh yeah, it's definitely her.
And then when I confronted him with it,

1117
01:55:19,439 --> 01:55:22,359
he totally tried to gaslight me.
Told me that I was crazy.

1118
01:55:22,760 --> 01:55:24,439
-You're not crazy.
-I know I'm not crazy.

1119
01:55:24,520 --> 01:55:26,000
-You're definitely not crazy.
-I know!

1120
01:55:26,079 --> 01:55:27,840
-You're the sanest person I know.
-I know.

1121
01:55:27,920 --> 01:55:30,199
I mean I caught him lying.
Lying's not cool. Fuck him.

1122
01:55:30,279 --> 01:55:31,680
Fuck him.

1123
01:55:32,840 --> 01:55:34,840
His smell
changes when he lies.

1124
01:55:36,479 --> 01:55:39,399
Yeah, and he shuffles his feet
when he feels guilty about something.

1125
01:55:41,199 --> 01:55:44,000
How come you've never said anything
like that to me before?

1126
01:55:44,680 --> 01:55:47,439
I don't know. You seemed to take him
and I tried to be supportive.

1127
01:55:52,239 --> 01:55:54,520
Well, you know,
it is what it is.

1128
01:55:55,199 --> 01:55:58,319
I mean it's good that we know
all this stuff, right?

1129
01:55:58,399 --> 01:56:00,279
I mean it's sad.

1130
01:56:04,119 --> 01:56:07,479
But as they say,
it's always darkest before dawn.

1131
01:56:09,319 --> 01:56:11,920
That's the time when you like
to eat your crunchy cereal.

1132
01:56:14,239 --> 01:56:16,800
Why don't we get into bed
and watch Chernobyl again?

1133
01:56:16,880 --> 01:56:19,119
That always seems to cheer you up.

1134
01:56:20,199 --> 01:56:22,600
Yeah, that sounds good.

1135
01:56:28,479 --> 01:56:30,319
Things will work out.

1136
01:56:31,079 --> 01:56:32,720
Yeah, they always do.
