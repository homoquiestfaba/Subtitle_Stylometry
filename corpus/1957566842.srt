1
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:24,090
Mercury is one of the most
toxic elements and a persistent

2
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:27,830
traveler through our environment.

3
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:31,850
So who's the travel agent
for this elemental poison?

4
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:34,040
Coal-fired power plants?

5
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,260
Most definitely.

6
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,130
Mining operations?

7
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:39,960
Of course.

8
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,570
Your neighborhood dental office?

9
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,708
Surprisingly, yes.

10
00:00:46,065 --> 00:00:48,170
Do you swear to tell
the whole truth and nothing

11
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:49,842
but the truth so help you God?

12
00:00:49,862 --> 00:00:52,095
Is mercury toxic?

13
00:00:52,115 --> 00:00:54,530
Elemental mercury is toxic.

14
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:58,325
Silver amalgam fillings,
does it contain mercury?

15
00:00:58,345 --> 00:00:59,480
It does.

16
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,040
Almost up to 50%?

17
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:03,062
Yes.

18
00:01:03,082 --> 00:01:06,980
Mercury is a toxic substance.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,170
If you're exposed to mercury,
we start seeing much more

20
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:11,910
serious health effects.

21
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:13,980
These health effects would be--

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,090
Chronic fatigue.

23
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:15,970
Double vision.

24
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:16,950
Couldn't sleep.

25
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:17,847
Depression.

26
00:01:17,867 --> 00:01:18,870
Panic attacks.

27
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:19,861
Memory loss.

28
00:01:19,881 --> 00:01:21,495
A lowered immune system.

29
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:22,680
Loss of vision.

30
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,060
Chronic headaches.

31
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,060
Is both an immediate
problem in some individuals,

32
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,030
and a very long term problem in others.

33
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:30,975
I started having neurological symptoms.

34
00:01:30,995 --> 00:01:32,590
I didn't feel like a human being.

35
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:35,250
In the deepest part of
myself, I thought I was dying.

36
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:40,100
People think you're
crazy, and you're not crazy.

37
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,985
You have mercury poisoning.

38
00:01:42,005 --> 00:01:47,220
Why is it that the ADA
will not tell the public that

39
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,910
mercury amalgam is harmful?

40
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:55,988
Frankly, the American Dental
Association welcomed new looks

41
00:01:56,008 --> 00:01:57,780
at all of the dental restorative materials.

42
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,440
The American people are being
overtly lied to by the American

43
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,570
Dental Association and the
dental branch of the Food,

44
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,975
Drug Administration.

45
00:02:31,715 --> 00:02:36,645
4, 3, 2, 1.

46
00:02:36,665 --> 00:02:40,460
You're watching Fox 17 News at 9:00.

47
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,410
Three years ago, I was
diagnosed with multiple

48
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:47,100
sclerosis, a debilitating
disease that scared me

49
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,300
to death.

50
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,730
But I stand before you
tonight not for pity,

51
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,830
but to share my hope that I believe

52
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:56,510
could help hundreds of thousands
of other sick people like me

53
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:59,550
in "My Journey to MS and Back."

54
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:01,950
My aspiration was to be a journalist

55
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:03,893
and tell stories that affect change,

56
00:03:03,913 --> 00:03:05,310
and tell stories that help people,

57
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:06,780
and tell stories that right wrongs,

58
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,070
and expose things that need
a light shined on them.

59
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:16,350
I'd just left my dream job with "CBS News"

60
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,060
as a national correspondent.

61
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,280
My husband had just left his career.

62
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,590
And we made those two
decisions based on the kind

63
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,270
of parents we wanted to be.

64
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:27,160
We wanted to be engaged parents.

65
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,110
We wanted to be active parents.

66
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:37,030
We wanted to be full-on,
hands-on, 24/7 parents.

67
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,890
We're very much an outdoorsy
family, love nature.

68
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:43,680
And I run or do some type of exercise,

69
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,030
workout five days a week.

70
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:50,080
No issues with my energy level
at all, I mean just felt great.

71
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,540
I mean, I felt great.

72
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,020
Typical day, taking care
of my kids and working,

73
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,210
and basically just focusing on my family.

74
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:02,100
Yeah, life was good until the
day I had the dental work done.

75
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,480
The thing about mercury is
it looks cool, but it's not.

76
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,730
It's really poisonous.

77
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,620
When you mess with mercury, it gets

78
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:16,420
in your clothes, your games,
your stuff, your furniture,

79
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,929
your house, until everything
it touches is trashed.

80
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:23,490
Elemental mercury is toxic
primarily through inhalation

81
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,510
exposure.

82
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,030
And people just don't
realize how dangerous it is.

83
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:29,280
But it is very important to recognize

84
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,100
that you can't see it, you can't smell it,

85
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,740
and there's no way to know that
it's there, except that we know

86
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,366
that it volatilizes into air.

87
00:04:37,386 --> 00:04:39,960
And you'll see it in
literature all the time,

88
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,300
it will volatilize at room
temperature and higher.

89
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,290
That's a very bad
misconception people have.

90
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,932
It will volatilize at anything
above negative 38 degrees.

91
00:04:46,952 --> 00:04:48,890
The higher the temperature,
the more readily it

92
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:51,015
will volatilize, the quicker
it will be volatilize.

93
00:04:51,035 --> 00:04:54,090
When a woman is pregnant, we
hope that she's never exposed

94
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:56,910
to mercury vapor, because
we know that it can pass

95
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,490
the placenta and cause
neurological problems

96
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,740
in the unborn baby.

97
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,130
And if we see residences or buildings that

98
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:08,910
have 10 micrograms per cubic
meter or more of mercury,

99
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:11,760
then we consider that
it poses a health risk.

100
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,620
And we recommend that people don't

101
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,240
stay in the building or the residence.

102
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:18,480
10 micrograms is generally
considered inhabitable without

103
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,980
some kind of respiratory protection.

104
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,590
Two schools will be closed
tomorrow after a custodian

105
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:25,410
finds a small amount of
mercury on the floor of a room

106
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,640
at Picklin Mills High School.

107
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,557
Now, how much mercury are we talking about?

108
00:05:28,577 --> 00:05:29,401
Not very much.

109
00:05:29,421 --> 00:05:32,940
About the amount the size of
the eraser on this pencil.

110
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,160
But school officials explained to us,

111
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,050
it would only take the amount of mercury

112
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,630
about the size of the
sharpened end of this pencil

113
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:41,657
to contaminate the entire building.

114
00:05:41,677 --> 00:05:43,740
They'll evacuate a
public building for a broken

115
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,770
thermometer.

116
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:46,317
But each one of your amalgam fillings

117
00:05:46,337 --> 00:05:48,170
contains roughly the
same amount of mercury.

118
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:59,878
I had one tooth hurting.

119
00:05:59,898 --> 00:06:02,170
So when I went to the dentist
and he looked at my mouth

120
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:05,950
and looked at the one tooth, but
she's more focused on the fact

121
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:08,480
that my silver fillings are 30 years old.

122
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,790
And there were eight of them.

123
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,560
And he was telling me that I needed

124
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,330
to get all of these silver fillings out

125
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:14,747
and I needed to get them replaced.

126
00:06:14,767 --> 00:06:16,705
And I kept saying, well,
this is the only tooth

127
00:06:16,725 --> 00:06:17,980
that's hurting, just this one.

128
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,300
Can we just replace that one?

129
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,250
And I let him talk me into replacing

130
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:23,800
all the silver fillings on the right side.

131
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,350
When it came time to refill them, he said,

132
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:27,670
what do you want in there?

133
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:30,380
Do you want amalgam, or
do you want the composite,

134
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,181
the white version?

135
00:06:31,201 --> 00:06:33,310
And I said, well, what
does insurance cover?

136
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,620
And he said, well,
insurance covers amalgam.

137
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,260
And the composite is a
little more expensive.

138
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,850
And I said, well, oh well, you know,

139
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,780
I've had these other ones
for 30 years, they work fine.

140
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,280
And if that's what insurance covers,

141
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,190
let's just get that again.

142
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:47,620
There was never a discussion about what

143
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,300
was in a silver filling.

144
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,400
I never gave it a second thought.

145
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,680
So I got four bright,
new, shiny silver fillings

146
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,700
put in on the right side.

147
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,616
And that's when everything started.

148
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:07,825
I was a professor of
chemistry and biochemistry

149
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:09,095
at the University of Kentucky.

150
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:18,300
I'd been doing mercury
research since about 1985.

151
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,870
I came to the University of Kentucky,

152
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:23,790
and my research here led me
into Alzheimer's disease.

153
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,280
Dr. Markesbery had found elevated mercury

154
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,600
in the brains of Alzheimer's patients.

155
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,570
So I did a set of studies showing what

156
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:32,158
heavy metals would do this.

157
00:07:32,178 --> 00:07:33,700
And mercury was one of them I put in.

158
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,490
And at that time, I had no concern

159
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:40,020
about amalgam fillings, anything
regarding mercury toxicity.

160
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,120
And the results were dramatic.

161
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,800
Phenomenal data that came out was

162
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,620
that mercury and only mercury would

163
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,110
cause the same biochemical abnormalities

164
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:50,910
as you saw in Alzheimer's disease

165
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,890
using our technology for evaluating

166
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:55,710
the activity of certain enzymes.

167
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:57,670
And then all of a sudden,
the problem changed.

168
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:01,350
It was no longer a scientific
problem that I ran into.

169
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:02,370
That was easy.

170
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,870
I mean, I could do that.

171
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:07,610
The problem was political.

172
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:11,720
When I tried to get funded to
look at mercury as a neurotoxin

173
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,970
and its possibilities of
contributing to Alzheimer's

174
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,440
disease, they shut me down.

175
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,708
My grants were just totally rejected.

176
00:08:18,728 --> 00:08:20,250
And they said something to the effect

177
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,190
Doc Haley has to realize we don't

178
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,425
need to see any more of
these kinds of studies.

179
00:08:24,445 --> 00:08:27,380
And since that time, I have
never gotten another NIH grant.

180
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,150
And that was soul destroying.

181
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:35,340
I had been funded for 20
some years of doing research.

182
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,409
Then all of a sudden,
I couldn't get a grant.

183
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:39,480
I had no money to run my laboratories.

184
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,550
And I felt like I just walked off a cliff

185
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:45,490
and was hanging onto that last branch.

186
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,860
And I was devastated.

187
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,110
And Sandy helped me through that.

188
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,580
When I first wrote in those grants,

189
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,030
I remember talking to
Sandy about how important I

190
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,230
thought they were.

191
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:00,370
Sandy is a good sounding
board, gives good advice.

192
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,950
And she helped me accept the
fact that my ideas were not

193
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:06,167
going to be accepted by the
current medical establishment.

194
00:09:28,532 --> 00:09:31,190
My name is Karen Burns.

195
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:33,450
I was a dental assistant for 24 years.

196
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:36,460
I got a lot of name tags here.

197
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,370
Time for my biannual dental appointment.

198
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,830
Hopefully, I'll have no cavities.

199
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:44,680
Going to Dr. Goldberg's office.

200
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,270
Dr. Goldberg is the dentist that I

201
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:50,800
worked for, I would say,
about seven years, my last job

202
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,410
that I had before I got sick.

203
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:55,930
And luckily, even though we
don't agree on the issue,

204
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,430
we've maintained a friendship.

205
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:01,450
And I go to the office parties
and going to lunch with them

206
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,960
after my cleaning today.

207
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:06,880
So it was a good way to
wrap up my dental career.

208
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,220
From his education and knowledge,

209
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,150
he has a difference of opinion
about what made me sick.

210
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:15,960
But he doesn't say that I'm not sick.

211
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,500
And he respects me.

212
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,472
And he even respects, I believe,
my activism that I'm doing.

213
00:10:20,492 --> 00:10:22,180
And I tell him all the time, I'm doing it

214
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,820
for him and the girls in the
office to make them safe.

215
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,830
So it's all good.

216
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:27,630
Hey, Darlene.

217
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:28,120
How are you?

218
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,100
Hello.

219
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,901
How're you doing?

220
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:31,550
Haven't seen you in a long time.

221
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,020
Six month.

222
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,960
Long.

223
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:38,440
My name is Dr. Richard Evan Goldberg.

224
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,210
I am a practicing general dentist

225
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:42,250
in Monroe Township, New Jersey.

226
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,290
I met Karen the year 2000.

227
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,950
She came to me as a dental
assistant with experience.

228
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:49,120
I hired her.

229
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:56,050
She proved herself to be a fun,
vivacious, energetic character

230
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:57,436
and a good dental assistant.

231
00:10:57,456 --> 00:10:58,236
Now.

232
00:10:58,256 --> 00:10:59,194
Hi, Dr. Goldberg.

233
00:10:59,214 --> 00:10:59,994
Good to see you.

234
00:11:00,014 --> 00:11:00,476
How are you?

235
00:11:00,496 --> 00:11:00,958
Good.

236
00:11:00,978 --> 00:11:01,440
Nice to see you.

237
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,240
How is everything?

238
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,190
Everything's good.

239
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:03,991
How are the boys?

240
00:11:04,011 --> 00:11:06,370
The boys are excellent.

241
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:09,640
She worked with me for a few years.

242
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,790
And then at some point, she physically

243
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:16,720
became unwell to the point
where she could no longer work.

244
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:21,280
She felt fairly early on
that her medical condition

245
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:26,982
was as a result to her exposure
of mercury and amalgam.

246
00:11:27,002 --> 00:11:28,270
All right, guys.

247
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:29,569
Say hello to everybody, OK?

248
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:30,435
Yeah, thank you.

249
00:11:30,455 --> 00:11:30,870
You're welcome.

250
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:31,110
Oh.

251
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:31,940
You're doing great.

252
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,330
OK.

253
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:32,600
I'll see you later?

254
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,280
All right.

255
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,192
If you have any problems, give me a buzz.

256
00:11:34,212 --> 00:11:34,993
OK.

257
00:11:35,013 --> 00:11:37,480
Discussion about dental
amalgams and its safety have

258
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,780
gone back before I went to school.

259
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,660
Big concern, obviously, is
mercury and the mercury coming

260
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,390
from dental amalgams, and whether or not

261
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:49,870
it has some kind of negative
effect on individuals

262
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:52,840
and to what degree can you measure it,

263
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,690
and whether or not it is to such a degree

264
00:11:55,710 --> 00:12:00,386
that it makes the material
unsafe for usage in people.

265
00:12:09,753 --> 00:12:13,990
In the early 1800s, organized
dentistry was still in its

266
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:15,040
infancy.

267
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:18,220
As there were no dental
schools or licensing boards,

268
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,160
it was common that craftsmen,
such as the local barber

269
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:24,220
or blacksmith might also
practice dentistry, which

270
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,160
at the time amounted to little
more than having teeth pulled

271
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,070
or gold fillings placed in cavities.

272
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,630
Dental mercury's introduction
to the United States

273
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:41,830
came in 1833 by the
Crawcour brothers of France.

274
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:45,280
They called it Royal Mineral
Succedaneum, a handmade mixture

275
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:49,780
of melted silver coin shavings
and elemental mercury.

276
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,490
The lower cost of this combination

277
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:55,300
of mercury with another metal,
otherwise known as an amalgam,

278
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,610
enabled a larger portion of the population

279
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:00,040
to afford the services
of those dentists who

280
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,215
used amalgam fillings.

281
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:07,490
But a bitter controversy started
brewing over the use of mercury

282
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:09,290
as a restorative material.

283
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:13,910
And by 1843, the world's first
national dental organization,

284
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:16,250
the American Society of Dental Surgeons,

285
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:19,430
passed a resolution stating
that the use of amalgam

286
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:22,816
was considered to be malpractice.

287
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,550
The American Society of Dental Surgeons

288
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:29,650
asked members to sign a pledge never

289
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,930
to place what the organization referred to

290
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:34,540
as poison metal fillings.

291
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,275
And those members who did use
amalgam risked being expelled.

292
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,310
And by 1856, the American
Society of Dental Surgeons

293
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:48,323
disbanded due to loss of membership.

294
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:56,970
In its place rose the American
Dental Association in 1859,

295
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:59,130
which to this day continues to promote

296
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,605
the safety of mercury fillings.

297
00:14:09,071 --> 00:14:12,280
Shortly after I had the dental work done,

298
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,250
I had this heavy metal taste in my mouth.

299
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:17,020
And it was all day, every day.

300
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,270
It was gross.

301
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:22,450
And so I started buying a
lot of gum and chewing gum

302
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:26,800
all the time, trying to mask
the taste or make it go away.

303
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,010
Then a few weeks, I started noticing

304
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:33,250
some weird neurological sensations.

305
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:36,070
I started having what I
would describe as like pin

306
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:37,570
prick feeling.

307
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:41,170
And I had the sensation
of cool water rushing down

308
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:43,540
the back of my head and down my back.

309
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,180
And I kept just sort of passing it off

310
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:50,080
as something fleeting that would go away.

311
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,930
But it kept building, the
symptoms kept building.

312
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:55,220
And then it affected my vision.

313
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,160
And I had blurred vision in one eye.

314
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,040
And then I had this
weird ringing in my ear.

315
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,790
I would be in a conversation with someone,

316
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:04,000
and there's like this, in my ear,

317
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,500
while I'm trying to talk to someone.

318
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:09,850
And the biggest effect was
these deep, deep headaches.

319
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:14,210
And they were so deep, I
mean, deep, deep down in my--

320
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:15,783
like in my brain.

321
00:15:15,803 --> 00:15:17,200
But when I would go to the doctor,

322
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,600
and they would tell me all of
these possibilities of what

323
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,220
it could be, then that
would kind of make me feel,

324
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,775
OK, this is probably in my head.

325
00:15:23,795 --> 00:15:26,150
It's probably a culmination
of all those things together.

326
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:26,871
And I'm going to be fine.

327
00:15:26,891 --> 00:15:28,078
And I'm going to ignore this.

328
00:15:28,098 --> 00:15:30,590
So I would just go on about
my business and think,

329
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,590
OK, they're right, they're
right, they're right,

330
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:33,101
and I'm wrong.

331
00:15:33,121 --> 00:15:34,150
This must be in my head.

332
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:35,680
This must be in my head.

333
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,661
It was in my head.

334
00:15:36,681 --> 00:15:37,900
It was in my teeth.

335
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,095
So I kept believing them, letting

336
00:15:40,115 --> 00:15:41,470
it get worse and worse and worse,

337
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:43,876
until the day when I woke
up and couldn't walk.

338
00:15:59,428 --> 00:16:02,705
The first time I saw Sandy
was she was walking down

339
00:16:02,725 --> 00:16:05,080
the farm lanes, and she would
walk up and get on the same

340
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,230
school bus I was riding on.

341
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:12,330
She's the first girl I ever dated.

342
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,140
When I was about a junior in high school,

343
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,720
I asked her on a hayride.

344
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,690
When I came back from out of
the Army, she picked me up.

345
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:21,223
We were sitting in her car.

346
00:16:21,243 --> 00:16:22,390
But I asked her to marry me.

347
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:24,490
And I told her what my goal was, was

348
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:27,610
to go get a PhD in chemistry and it

349
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:30,050
was going to be tough for
about four or five years,

350
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:32,070
because you're not going
to make a lot of money.

351
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,770
Well, it's been very
important to both Boyd and I

352
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,630
to stay balanced.

353
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:42,550
And we both love nature.

354
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:45,320
We both love animals.

355
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:48,340
So this is a perfect place for us.

356
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,390
It's our refuge against
the stresses of life.

357
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:53,550
So we love it here.

358
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:03,370
For over 20 years, Boyd
has committed himself

359
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:09,069
to educating people about the
dangers of mercury exposure.

360
00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:12,250
He has traveled all over the world.

361
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:14,240
Sometimes, he's gone once a month.

362
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:18,440
So it's a considerable amount of time.

363
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:26,040
He has sacrificed a lot in the
way of time, energy, and money.

364
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:29,165
He doesn't do this for monetary reasons.

365
00:17:29,185 --> 00:17:32,120
He does it 'cause he's so
passionate and committed

366
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:34,220
to the cause.

367
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,860
It takes a very courageous person

368
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:43,730
to be truthful and speak
honestly as he has.

369
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,046
I admire him for that.

370
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:55,570
But since 1991, I've
been giving talks all over

371
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:56,381
the world.

372
00:17:56,401 --> 00:18:00,000
I was averaging over 30 trips a year.

373
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:03,170
And I testified in front of Congress.

374
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:05,410
I've gone to Europe many, many times.

375
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:07,980
And that's not an easy trip
for an older person like me.

376
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,400
It takes a lot of starch out of you.

377
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:13,380
The organization that actually
introduced me to the concept

378
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,690
that dental amalgams were releasing

379
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:18,780
toxic amounts of mercury is
The International Academy

380
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,420
of Oral Medicine and
Toxicology, because they

381
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,180
thought it was causing
a lot of medical damage.

382
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,140
And they were right.

383
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,070
I mean, I agree with them now.

384
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:27,001
I didn't at the time.

385
00:18:27,021 --> 00:18:29,880
I thought that the FDA nor the ADA

386
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,770
would allow anyone to put something

387
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:36,480
in the mouths of citizens that
released so much mercury vapor

388
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,450
and not have tested it.

389
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:42,780
I've given up a huge number
of my weekends with my family

390
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,000
to go to meetings, because
this is a message that

391
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:48,263
has to get out, that the
amalgams are toxic to people

392
00:18:48,283 --> 00:18:49,700
and are causing a lot of problems.

393
00:18:56,145 --> 00:18:59,030
I don't see my family as much as I used to.

394
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,530
They live here in Staten Island.

395
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:01,550
I live in New Jersey.

396
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:06,890
Like my husband said, you know, most people

397
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:09,030
don't know about mercury poisoning.

398
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:11,310
They don't know anyone else
with mercury poisoning.

399
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:13,010
They don't read about it in the news.

400
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,780
They don't hear about it.

401
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:19,030
So even though I have it,
they don't really understand.

402
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:21,620
Because they assume-- they
see me, I'm on my feet

403
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,480
and everything is fine.

404
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,320
It's kind of like they
forget that I'm sick.

405
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,860
And I don't want to be sick.

406
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,010
FDA says it's safe.

407
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:33,100
The ADA really says it's safe.

408
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,210
So they don't understand
how I could be sick from it

409
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:38,270
and nobody else is.

410
00:19:47,036 --> 00:19:50,930
Amalgams or silver fillings
have been used for over 150

411
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:51,771
years.

412
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:54,770
Some critics have claimed
that amalgams are unsafe.

413
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,120
This is not true.

414
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:59,120
You can't install a
mercury-releasing product

415
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:02,720
into someone's mouth 2 inches
from their brain and expect not

416
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,370
to see some repercussions.

417
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:06,650
Amalgam fillings contain roughly 50%

418
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:08,510
elemental mercury, which releases

419
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:10,910
mercury vapor that is 100 to 600 times

420
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:14,450
higher than what the FDA estimates.

421
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:16,550
The science tells us
that 80% of the mercury

422
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:19,640
vapor we breathe accumulates
in our bodies very quickly.

423
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,180
But a good portion end up in our brains.

424
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,890
There are vapors, mercury vapors,

425
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:28,700
that are emitted from dental
amalgam during the mixing

426
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,980
process, during the placement process.

427
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,680
There is no evidence that at this point

428
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:37,990
that the mercury vapors, say
that were emitted, are harmful.

429
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:41,720
And I woke up the next
morning, and I got out of bed,

430
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:45,590
and I was walking sort of like this.

431
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:48,650
And I had to reach for the door facing.

432
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:52,520
And I-- as hard as I tried to get my brain

433
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:55,590
to tell my legs to walk straight,

434
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:57,440
I couldn't make them work.

435
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:01,580
It was beyond frightening.

436
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,430
I didn't know if I'd
had a stroke overnight.

437
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:07,600
I just couldn't figure
out what was going on.

438
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:11,030
And I called my husband, and
I said, honey, I can't walk.

439
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:11,901
I was so scared.

440
00:21:11,921 --> 00:21:14,358
I was home alone, and I knew
the kids were about to get up.

441
00:21:14,378 --> 00:21:16,163
And I'm trying to figure out--

442
00:21:16,183 --> 00:21:18,330
I'm not going to be able
to care for these children.

443
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:20,093
So we went back to the doctor that day.

444
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:22,010
And the same doctor who
had been telling me it

445
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:25,227
could be all these other things
and same doctor this day,

446
00:21:25,247 --> 00:21:26,810
after she ran a couple of tests on me,

447
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:29,080
she said just kind of in callous manner,

448
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,860
well, you've either got
MS or a brain tumor.

449
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,220
So we're going to get you in
for your MRI later tonight.

450
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,927
And we'll get right on this.

451
00:21:36,947 --> 00:21:39,260
I mean, my husband I both
looked at each other thinking,

452
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,420
did we just hear what
we think we just heard.

453
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,690
What just happened?

454
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:46,180
I've been coming to you for
three or four months telling

455
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,650
you something's wrong, and you're

456
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:48,591
telling me everything's fine.

457
00:21:48,611 --> 00:21:50,715
And now, you tell me I
have a brain tumor or MS?

458
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:56,410
From there, we went to see an MS doctor.

459
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:58,900
And he ran a bunch of tests and came back

460
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,230
and said, at this point, we're going

461
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:04,557
to hold off on treating
you with any MS medication,

462
00:22:04,577 --> 00:22:06,640
because we want to see you
back in six months just

463
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,680
to kind of see where
things are and kind of get

464
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,890
a better feel of how your body's
going to react to this disease.

465
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:14,560
And I mean, I am in tears.

466
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:17,020
Would you please give me these MS shots,

467
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,510
give me something, slow this thing down?

468
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:20,441
I'm raising babies.

469
00:22:20,461 --> 00:22:22,510
I need you to stop this train.

470
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:24,280
And he wouldn't give me any medicine.

471
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:28,837
And now looking back, that was
basically the hand of God just

472
00:22:28,857 --> 00:22:30,670
interceding right at
that moment and saying,

473
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:33,360
just hold on, hold on, just
wait, there's something better.

474
00:22:37,419 --> 00:22:39,550
I'm Dr. Matthew Young.

475
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:42,820
I'm a general dentist here in
Hendersonville, North Carolina.

476
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,460
I've been here at this
location for 29 years.

477
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,800
I was a traditional dentist
for about 10 or 12 years

478
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,960
and then found out about
the dangers of mercury

479
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,670
and other dental materials.

480
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:55,510
So we became mercury-free, not
putting in any mercury amalgam

481
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:56,650
fillings.

482
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:59,160
And then when I discovered
The International Academy

483
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:03,250
of Oral Medicine and Toxicology,
then I became mercury-safe.

484
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:06,730
What that means is we use
special protective engineering

485
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:10,000
controls for OSHA to reduce
the exposure of our employees

486
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,730
and our patients to the mercury vapor

487
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,500
when the old mercury fillings are removed.

488
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:19,960
Well, we've been out here at Dr.

489
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:23,140
Young's office this week
installing a multipoint mercury

490
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,530
monitoring system that
continuously and sequentially

491
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:29,320
measures from eight different
sample points throughout as his

492
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,880
dental office.

493
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,450
Almost all of our other
clients that deal with mercury

494
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:36,467
are required by OSHA and EPA
to measure their facility

495
00:23:36,487 --> 00:23:38,800
throughout the day to make
sure that their employees are

496
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,990
below the ceiling limit, which is

497
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:43,240
100 micrograms per cubic meter.

498
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,250
Dr. Young has taken a major step here

499
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,260
by being the first
dentist that I'm aware of

500
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,570
to install a multipoint mercury monitoring

501
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:50,775
system into his office.

502
00:23:50,795 --> 00:23:52,150
He's doing everything that he can

503
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:55,320
to keep his employees and
himself as well as his patients

504
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:58,120
save during normal procedures that

505
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,625
have to do with dental
mercury amalgam fillings.

506
00:24:00,645 --> 00:24:03,623
And this was what the
OSHA regulation requires,

507
00:24:03,643 --> 00:24:06,040
is that the dentist is aware
of how much mercury is in his

508
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:09,190
office, that the employees
are educated about it.

509
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:11,710
We have a heavy metal
chapter in our OSHA handbook

510
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:14,280
that the employees have
to read and understand.

511
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,630
And they have to wear
special protective gear,

512
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:18,100
so it keeps off their skin.

513
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,050
And they're not allowed to breathe it.

514
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:23,230
And our machine keeps track
of how clean the air is here

515
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,942
in order to stay below
these dangerous levels.

516
00:24:25,962 --> 00:24:28,150
And I think it's incumbent
ethically upon the dentist

517
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:31,900
to be aware of those risks and
to also monitor and educate

518
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:35,475
their employees every day.

519
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:55,860
I just flew in from Santiago, Chile,

520
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,850
where I gave a presentation
to a group of legislators

521
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:00,560
and researchers down there.

522
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:04,580
And tomorrow, I give a talk
to The International Academy

523
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:08,000
of Oral Medicine and Toxicology on how

524
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:11,000
mercury causes some of the
biochemical abnormalities

525
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:13,280
that we see in some of
the neurological diseases

526
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,740
such as Alzheimer's disease.

527
00:25:19,822 --> 00:25:22,125
Dr. Haley is a research scientist,

528
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:25,140
an international lecturer,
is a former chairman

529
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,790
of the department of chemistry
at the University of Kentucky.

530
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:31,080
He has numerous research studies
published in peer reviewed,

531
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,400
medical scientific journals.

532
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:35,143
Please welcome to the
program Dr. Boyd Haley.

533
00:25:39,873 --> 00:25:44,780
Mercury and only mercury
causes the break down and deep

534
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:48,130
polymerization of tubulin
off of the neurofibril,

535
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:49,780
producing neurofibrillary tangles,

536
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:53,380
which is the hallmark
of Alzheimer's disease.

537
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,570
Not only that, but published studies

538
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:58,450
repeatedly show that the
widespread exposure of mercury

539
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:02,260
and its effects on the brain
explains every single aspect

540
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,460
of Alzheimer's disease.

541
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,310
It is the missing piece of the puzzle

542
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:09,250
that's been literally right
under the noses of researchers

543
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:17,270
for all these years

544
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:21,990
Metal amalgams release many,
many micrograms of mercury per

545
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:23,550
day into our bodies.

546
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:28,020
So you not only have a toxin
that can do the effect,

547
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:31,270
you have it placed within
inches of your brain.

548
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:33,530
And how do you get that across to people?

549
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,540
And I think I do a decent job.

550
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:39,464
But sometimes, I'm not
so sure it's adequate.

551
00:26:39,484 --> 00:26:41,450
And a lot of people, they want my slides.

552
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:43,380
Anybody who asked for them, have my slides.

553
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,000
You give my talk, I don't care.

554
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:48,538
I mean, this is not information
that's secretive or anything.

555
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:51,100
It's something that should be
out there for everybody to use.

556
00:27:02,393 --> 00:27:06,350
Here I was with six months
to do nothing but wait and get

557
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:07,463
worse.

558
00:27:07,483 --> 00:27:09,380
And I thought, well,
what else do I have to do

559
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,480
but maybe try to look
into this and figure out

560
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,160
where all this came from.

561
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:17,030
The very next Sunday at
church, a guy in our classes

562
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:19,580
said, you know, my brother treats

563
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,980
people who've been diagnosed with MS.

564
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,610
He treats them for heavy
metal toxicity related

565
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:27,050
to their fillings.

566
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:28,550
He said, I don't know much about it.

567
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:30,080
But I know that he's had some success.

568
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,450
And there's something about
there's mercury or something

569
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:33,261
in these fillings.

570
00:27:33,281 --> 00:27:34,765
He said, do you have any of those?

571
00:27:34,785 --> 00:27:37,040
And I said, well, yeah,
I just got four new ones,

572
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,980
and I have four old ones on this side.

573
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,510
That was my first glimmer
of hope, the first moment

574
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:47,480
that I had been told anything
that even remotely sounded

575
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:51,070
like there might be some sort
of hope out there for me.

576
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:57,510
I could not believe I didn't
know that there was mercury

577
00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:00,240
in these silver fillings.

578
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,480
I couldn't believe it.

579
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,605
I thought, oh, well, this has to be a lie.

580
00:28:03,625 --> 00:28:05,260
I think the majority of people still

581
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,170
do not know what these dentists
are putting in their mouth

582
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:09,690
and in the mouths of their children.

583
00:28:24,973 --> 00:28:28,700
According to a 2006 nationwide Zogby poll,

584
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,260
76% of consumers did not know
mercury was the main component

585
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,510
of dental amalgam fillings.

586
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:38,540
But once informed, 92% of respondents

587
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,060
thought their dentist should
be required to inform them

588
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,940
about mercury and
non-mercury dental fillings

589
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:47,120
prior to treatment.

590
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:49,070
The majority of dentists are not aware

591
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:51,700
that under the learned
intermediary doctrine,

592
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,690
health care practitioners are bound

593
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:56,190
by law to pass along manufacturer warnings

594
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:56,991
to patients.

595
00:28:57,011 --> 00:28:58,880
We know that's not being done.

596
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:01,220
In fact, it's worse than you think.

597
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,285
It's prohibited.

598
00:29:02,305 --> 00:29:06,780
Regrettably, the American
Dental Association has

599
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:13,030
a provision in its code of
ethics to stop dentists from

600
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:18,460
initiating communications
with patients about the risk

601
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,220
of mercury dental fillings.

602
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,640
This what I call gag rule has unfortunately

603
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:28,500
been enforced by many
dentist-dominated state

604
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,520
dental boards.

605
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:39,000
Today, I'm here with
the Pennsylvania Coalition

606
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:41,400
for Mercury-Free Dentistry.

607
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:44,520
And we were talking to patients going in

608
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,170
to get free dental care.

609
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:48,060
And we were letting them know they

610
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:52,020
were eligible to get a white
filling for no extra cost.

611
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,256
And that would be safer for them.

612
00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:01,740
A lot of the dentists that
came out and dental assistants

613
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,630
were putting their eyes up in the air,

614
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:07,110
like they were aggravated
that we would come and talk

615
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:08,760
to the patients like this.

616
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:12,210
But you know, I wish somebody told me

617
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:16,170
that I was breathing in
all these toxic fumes.

618
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:18,100
I had no idea.

619
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:21,100
And these people in the
school that are being trained,

620
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,120
they have no idea.

621
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:50,860
Well, I can't remember
when I didn't enjoy fishing.

622
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,970
I mean, my granddad was a person
who liked to fish quite a bit

623
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:58,120
and took me quite often.

624
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:01,500
It's always been a major relaxation for me.

625
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:06,820
Went to graduate school, we ate a lot

626
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,940
of what I either caught
fishing, my wife and I,

627
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:14,890
or what I shot bird hunting with my dogs.

628
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:18,520
Catching fish was a supplement to our diet.

629
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:21,110
And since we didn't have a lot of money,

630
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:22,720
eating a fish was probably better

631
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:25,140
than a lot we could buy
in the grocery store.

632
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:29,030
It's a big, big difference.

633
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:31,990
And it's kind of sad that
today the kids are told--

634
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:34,080
everyone's told, don't
eat too many of the fish,

635
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,430
they're too toxic with mercury.

636
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:39,010
There are fish advisories in
about almost all the water

637
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,110
in the United States.

638
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:43,310
I think it's sad.

639
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:45,970
Why go fish, if you can't
eat the fish you're catching.

640
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:48,460
You're catching something
that's toxic, why--

641
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:53,810
it just takes the romance and
the livelihoodness out of it.

642
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:55,330
And I think we should do everything

643
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:58,100
we can to get our water
and air clean again.

644
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,100
That means we have to
stop all kinds of mercury.

645
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,802
We can't blame just one group.

646
00:32:02,822 --> 00:32:05,260
And the ones that-- things that
you can do something about,

647
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:09,580
like dental amalgams, that should be done.

648
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,010
The United Nations
Environment Programme reports

649
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:18,470
that 10% of global mercury usage
is for amalgam tooth fillings.

650
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:22,520
This results in up to 340
tons of dental mercury

651
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:25,490
journeying into the environment each year.

652
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:29,300
In the United States, dentists
are currently the largest users

653
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,220
of elemental mercury.

654
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,790
This accounts for roughly 32
tons of mercury used yearly

655
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:37,730
to place amalgam
restorations, otherwise known

656
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,800
as silver fillings.

657
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,690
Although the number of amalgams placed

658
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:44,360
has decreased over the last few decades,

659
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:47,660
dentists still use amalgam
without precautions.

660
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:50,170
So the threat of mercury
exposure continues.

661
00:32:54,562 --> 00:32:57,640
Tonight, I continue my
story with a comprehensive look

662
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:01,750
at efforts to ban silver
fillings across the world.

663
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:03,220
This year, the US State Department

664
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,250
proclaimed we should phase
down the use of mercury amalgam

665
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:09,140
fillings during international
treaty talks at the United

666
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,330
Nations.

667
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:12,680
But the mercury treaty, as it's called,

668
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:15,010
which would affect every
dentist in the world,

669
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:17,512
is not a done deal yet.

670
00:33:23,778 --> 00:33:29,140
Whether or not I believe
that the minute amounts of inert

671
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:33,280
dental amalgam that might go
down into a system really will

672
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:36,190
affect the water supplies of a community,

673
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:39,600
I haven't seen any evidence to suggest it,

674
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:42,640
I'm always open to changing my mind.

675
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:45,430
Because of the United Nations
mercury treaty recognizing

676
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:48,310
dentistry as a significant
contributor to environmental

677
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:52,360
mercury exposure, the EPA is
considering regulations that

678
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:55,210
would require all dentists to
install equipment that would

679
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:57,200
capture the dental
mercury before it reaches

680
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,220
the environment.

681
00:34:01,868 --> 00:34:06,200
For over 75 years, consumers
and dental professionals have

682
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:09,380
looked for the American Dental
Association seal of acceptance

683
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,590
on products.

684
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:13,880
The ADA seal stands for
quality and effectiveness.

685
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:16,100
Manufacturers who apply for the seal

686
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,990
must meet certain criteria.

687
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:21,740
They must provide objective data
supporting the product safety.

688
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,159
You've never done any
safety studies on this product.

689
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:28,070
I'm the former consumer
representative on the Dental

690
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:30,590
Products Panel at the FDA.

691
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:34,490
If amalgam is taken to
a class III by the FDA,

692
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:37,400
class III would require
manufacturers to prove safety,

693
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,900
which they never had to do.

694
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:42,139
They're not going to spend
the millions of dollars to try

695
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,872
to prove that mercury is safe
when everyone knows it isn't.

696
00:34:45,892 --> 00:34:49,070
All product claims made
on packaging and labeling are

697
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:50,610
approved by the ADA.

698
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,639
So you can trust them.

699
00:35:04,053 --> 00:35:05,325
My name's Christopher Shade.

700
00:35:05,345 --> 00:35:08,710
I have a PhD in environmental
and analytical chemistry

701
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:09,800
of mercury.

702
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:12,580
I developed a new testing technology

703
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,400
for separating different forms of mercury.

704
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:18,190
We use that now in clinical testing

705
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:22,270
to look at how different forms
of mercury go into the body

706
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:24,430
and build up in different reservoirs

707
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:26,770
and how they come out.

708
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:29,680
We've run about 20,000 tests now.

709
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,230
And unfortunately, most mainstream dentists

710
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:34,180
don't come to me to look for testing.

711
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,970
They're taught that there
is no mercury exposure.

712
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:39,250
And so the only guys that I look at

713
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:41,210
are the mercury-free dentists, which means

714
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:42,620
they're only removing amalgam.

715
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,170
They're not placing it.

716
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:47,070
And they even stick out
from the regular population

717
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:49,790
as having higher mercury levels.

718
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:53,290
So if these guys, who are
taking every step they

719
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:57,940
can to lower all of their
occupational exposure,

720
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:02,080
just imagine what the dentists
who take no precautions look

721
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,352
like.

722
00:36:03,372 --> 00:36:06,700
I had a regular life.

723
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,060
Everything was going good.

724
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,960
And when my daughter
was about two years old,

725
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,930
I started to get sicker and sicker.

726
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:19,670
I finally went to a holistic doctor.

727
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:21,990
And they asked what I did for a living.

728
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:23,540
And I said I was a dental assistant.

729
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:27,590
A dental assistant has the
potential to have a very high

730
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:29,600
amount of mercury in the brain.

731
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:34,100
Neurological symptoms happen
to be the most dominant symptom

732
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:37,060
in the constellation of problems
that mercury can create.

733
00:36:42,688 --> 00:36:45,720
Well, I've been diagnosed
with fibromyalgia and chronic

734
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:47,170
fatigue.

735
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:49,250
So they tested my hair and my urine

736
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:53,572
and found out that I had
full-blown mercury poisoning.

737
00:36:53,592 --> 00:36:57,660
Karen Burns' urinary levels
at the time of her sickness

738
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,630
were well within the range
where this could be an issue.

739
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:04,380
So she had sufficient exposure to cause

740
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,180
serious neurological effects.

741
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:10,320
And this was causing my
fatigue, and my muscle pain,

742
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:14,010
and my lowered immune system, my rashes,

743
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:17,220
the numbness in my hands
and fingers and feet.

744
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:20,700
So a lot of these fatigue
symptoms that come along with

745
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:25,510
the mercury exposure, along
with the emotionality, are very,

746
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:30,890
very obvious repercussions
of a mercury toxicity.

747
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:35,580
I worked for over 20 dentists.

748
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:40,050
None of them ever said amalgam wasn't safe.

749
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:41,610
They didn't tell anybody that there

750
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:45,216
were warnings on the labels.

751
00:37:45,236 --> 00:37:48,220
We discovered that when you
remove these old fillings with

752
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:52,450
the dental drill that a large
vapor of mercury is exposing

753
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:56,510
the patient and the
employee in the workplace.

754
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:59,620
So we put in protective
engineering controls

755
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,880
to filter the air, filter the water,

756
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:04,480
and to reduce the patient
and employees' exposure

757
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,400
to that toxic level of mercury.

758
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:10,780
I don't particularly have
great concerns with the removal

759
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,750
of dental amalgams.

760
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:17,080
And like I've said to you,
if something came up tomorrow

761
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,790
where I thought I was conv-- there

762
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:21,190
was some convincing evidence that it

763
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:22,960
would show some kind of harm, of course,

764
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:25,146
then perhaps I would change.

765
00:38:25,166 --> 00:38:28,270
"Barnes versus Kerr,"
David Barnes is a dentist

766
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:29,680
in Shelbyville, Tennessee.

767
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:32,813
He hired me, and off we
went against the largest

768
00:38:32,833 --> 00:38:34,730
manufacturer of dental
amalgam in the country,

769
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:36,310
Kerr Corporation.

770
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:40,060
What they did was present
evidence that their warning was

771
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:45,047
Kerr's warnings are published
in material safety data sheets

772
00:38:45,067 --> 00:38:47,130
that they're required to
distribute their product.

773
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:51,200
But the warning essentially said
that mercury is a neurotoxin.

774
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:53,770
And it was at least
arguable that all the things

775
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:56,800
that Kerr was warning
about happened to Burns.

776
00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:00,520
So Kerr's position was,
this is a dangerous product.

777
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,662
We told you it's a dangerous product.

778
00:39:02,682 --> 00:39:04,120
And the case ought to be dismissed,

779
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:05,890
because you've been adequately warned.

780
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:07,640
OK, a little history here.

781
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:09,100
When dentists go to dental school,

782
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:12,150
they're taught that mixed dental
amalgam is completely inert.

783
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:14,920
And so when a dentist goes in
to grind out an amalgam filling,

784
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:16,732
he is creating tremendous quantities

785
00:39:16,752 --> 00:39:17,691
of mercury particulate.

786
00:39:17,711 --> 00:39:21,000
The particulate is bound to the
other constituents of amalgam.

787
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:24,100
But Burns was absorbing
tremendous amounts, thousands

788
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,920
of micrograms of mercury a
day, and ultimately began

789
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,990
to suffer a very predictable consequence.

790
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:32,470
Back to our case, Kerr tells
us it's warning is adequate.

791
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:34,360
We say, no, it's not.

792
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,820
The vast majority of the
mercury going into a system

793
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,550
is from this mixed dental amalgam.

794
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:39,391
And it was.

795
00:39:39,411 --> 00:39:41,320
And I don't think anyone argued with that.

796
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,330
So is the warning adequate
if it only tells them

797
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:44,770
that mercury is poisonous?

798
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:46,780
To my surprise, the district report

799
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,520
said, yeah, it is adequate.

800
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:51,490
The manufacturer didn't say
that the poisonous mercury would

801
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:54,280
be any less poisonous when mixed
with the other dental amalgam

802
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,231
constituents.

803
00:39:55,251 --> 00:39:56,980
The appellate court in a published opinion

804
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,670
also felt that the adequacy of the warning

805
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:04,270
was such that Burns was
or should have been aware

806
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:07,640
that mixed dental amalgam
was completely poisonous.

807
00:40:16,795 --> 00:40:20,380
I had been pushed by the
FDA, American Dental Association

808
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,580
as somebody that's on the lunatic fringe.

809
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,880
And what's lunatic about, the fact

810
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,400
that somebody is putting
a most toxic metal known

811
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:30,745
to man in your mouth, and I'm saying,

812
00:40:30,765 --> 00:40:32,245
hey, we really need to look at this.

813
00:40:32,265 --> 00:40:35,320
This may be the cause
of Alzheimer's disease.

814
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:36,500
We have to do something.

815
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:40,055
We have to come up with
something that's very dramatic.

816
00:40:40,075 --> 00:40:43,510
I am going to visualize the
mercury vapor rolling off

817
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:45,850
of these amalgams when
you put a drill on them

818
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:48,430
or when you abrade them in any way.

819
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:50,530
This will leave no doubt in people's mind

820
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:53,530
that there's a lot of mercury
coming out of dental amalgams,

821
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:56,440
when you put them in,
when you take them out.

822
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:58,300
I'm very optimistic this may change

823
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:01,580
the entire attitude of the
American Dental Association.

824
00:41:04,388 --> 00:41:08,050
Dr. Boyd Haley coming from
University of Kentucky up

825
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:08,951
at Lexington.

826
00:41:08,971 --> 00:41:13,460
And he's going to help us
to put the box together,

827
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:16,625
where we're going to
visualize the mercury vapor.

828
00:41:16,645 --> 00:41:20,810
Yeah, the first smoking
tooth video shows a 25-year-old

829
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:23,510
amalgam from an extract a tooth.

830
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:25,580
And they put it in front
of the mercury lamp,

831
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,230
and you can see exactly how
much mercury is vaporizing off

832
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:29,031
the filling.

833
00:41:29,051 --> 00:41:31,580
When you see this for the
first time, it's quite a shock

834
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,550
to see the amount of mercury and the volume

835
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:37,097
that your patients are either
breathing or swallowing.

836
00:41:37,117 --> 00:41:38,930
And from then on, I
knew that I wasn't going

837
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:40,013
to place anymore amalgams.

838
00:41:40,033 --> 00:41:43,315
And when I remove them, I
was going to do it safely.

839
00:41:43,335 --> 00:41:44,690
I just think the best thing to do

840
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:49,648
is to keep in mind that our
ethical creed is to do no harm.

841
00:41:49,668 --> 00:41:51,440
I think the biggest inflection from anybody

842
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:54,250
who first joins the IAOMT is you're

843
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:56,000
going to have to talk to the same patients

844
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:58,880
that you just put the mercury
fillings in maybe a year ago,

845
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:01,460
two years ago, and tell
them that you've learned

846
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,500
this new information about it.

847
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,158
I think you have to come to
terms in your own ethics,

848
00:42:06,178 --> 00:42:08,450
in your own heart as to how
you're going to communicate

849
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:10,760
that and how you're going to present that

850
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:13,280
to patients without feeling
like you're contradicting

851
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,240
your previous work.

852
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:17,990
The most beautiful part
about the whole transition

853
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:20,927
is that your patient loyalty
really blooms tremendously,

854
00:42:20,947 --> 00:42:22,760
because it seems like
the patients know more

855
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:25,010
about this than the traditional dentist do.

856
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:27,530
We're finding out that
mercury's been taking out

857
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:30,380
a lot of other medicines and
other industries in the world.

858
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,480
And it's soon going to be removed

859
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:35,690
from dentistry, according to
the UN treaty in 2013, we hope.

860
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:40,431
So when the times change,
it's wise to change with them.

861
00:42:40,451 --> 00:42:42,740
There's a difference
between someone coming in here

862
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:46,400
and being concerned about the
safety of the amalgam and after

863
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:48,838
me educating a patient, who's a lay person,

864
00:42:48,858 --> 00:42:51,380
who's not in the profession and
may just have heard something

865
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:56,630
from a fairly uneducated
journalist about this,

866
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:58,620
that I will-- after that discussion,

867
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,830
they still feel that they
would like them removed,

868
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:03,386
I might consider doing it for them.

869
00:43:03,406 --> 00:43:06,860
OK, this is going to be a lot of money.

870
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,970
It sounds crazy, looks crazy.

871
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:12,460
And if this works, why
isn't everybody doing it?

872
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,740
And where are we going to
find the money to do this?

873
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,282
And what if it doesn't work and we've

874
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:18,100
poured all this money down the drain, then

875
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,780
what am I going to do?

876
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,270
And my husband and I talked about it,

877
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:24,940
prayed about it over several weeks.

878
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:29,020
And we decided that we needed to
get these fillings out and just

879
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,490
see what happened.

880
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:31,481
And that was $10,000.

881
00:43:31,501 --> 00:43:38,170
I have a real hard time
with is when you have doctors

882
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:42,460
espousing removals of dental amalgams,

883
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,415
because they believe that some
systemic illness is the cause

884
00:43:45,435 --> 00:43:46,216
of it.

885
00:43:46,236 --> 00:43:49,990
And within a week of getting
the silver fillings out,

886
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:54,032
the mercury out of my
mouth, I was 50% better.

887
00:43:54,052 --> 00:43:57,190
The science is not very convincing.

888
00:43:57,210 --> 00:43:58,091
It's not.

889
00:43:58,111 --> 00:44:00,970
Because you can find people
with these conditions

890
00:44:00,990 --> 00:44:03,105
without dental amalgams in their mouths.

891
00:44:03,125 --> 00:44:07,180
The dental industry promotes
a stance that on its surface

892
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,310
seems simple and adequate.

893
00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:12,100
It says that if she got sick from mercury,

894
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,740
then all the dental assistants
would be sick for mercury,

895
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:18,730
all the dentists be sick from
mercury, but they're not.

896
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:22,240
But if you really understand the
complexities of biochemistry,

897
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:25,060
genetics, and genetic susceptibility,

898
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:29,310
you'd see that that's really
a flawed scientific stance.

899
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:31,960
Lead will increase the
toxicity of a known amount

900
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:34,395
of mercury over 100-fold.

901
00:44:34,415 --> 00:44:36,520
And so when people say,
well, we can look at people

902
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:39,530
and they don't have enough
mercury to be mercury toxic,

903
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:41,750
well, I would say, you're not that smart.

904
00:44:41,770 --> 00:44:43,930
You have to know what
the lead concentration is

905
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:44,921
in that person.

906
00:44:44,941 --> 00:44:48,460
Every human body has
a genetic predisposition

907
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,645
to handle toxicity a certain way.

908
00:44:51,665 --> 00:44:53,020
And that's what's so frustrating,

909
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,510
is they just feel like they can dismiss

910
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:58,810
all of this information,
and all of these studies,

911
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:02,920
and all of the stories
like mine of people being

912
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:07,610
cured because not everybody who
has amalgam fillings get sick.

913
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:11,680
And there's a very strong
biological reason for this.

914
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:14,830
And it comes down to the
individual's susceptibility.

915
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:17,980
Most of this is genetic susceptibility.

916
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,390
Certain people will get sick,
will have symptoms at much

917
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:25,032
lower levels of exposure than other people.

918
00:45:25,052 --> 00:45:26,740
But what I personally would not do is,

919
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:30,550
if somebody came in with, say,
multiple sclerosis and said I

920
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:33,700
heard that if I remove all these
dental fillings my multiple

921
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:36,950
sclerosis is going to go
away, I won't do that.

922
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:38,950
I will tell them that I
do not believe that that

923
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:40,240
is the science at all.

924
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:43,120
I'm not convinced of it
and that I would perhaps

925
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:46,630
be doing more harm to
them than good in trying

926
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:47,880
to remove these things.

927
00:46:00,255 --> 00:46:05,170
Dental amalgam has been used
in dentistry for over 150 years

928
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:07,630
and was grandfathered into
use by the Food and Drug

929
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:08,890
Administration.

930
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:12,100
Because of this, the
product was not classified.

931
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:15,520
In 1976, Congress passed a law mandating

932
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:18,400
that the FDA classify
all products which had

933
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:21,250
been grandfathered into use.

934
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:24,190
After 33 years of ignoring
the congressional mandate

935
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:28,000
to classify amalgam
fillings, the FDA was sued.

936
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:31,420
Charlie Brown, National
Council Consumers for Dental

937
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,960
Choice, our mission is to ban
the use of mercury-based dental

938
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:37,520
fillings known incorrectly
as silver fillings.

939
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:41,050
And we sought a court order
to order FDA to classify.

940
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:44,010
The judge Ellen Huvelle said that's enough.

941
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:45,070
You go into mediation.

942
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:47,050
You come back here a week from Monday.

943
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:50,440
And you tell me what date you're
going to classify amalgam,

944
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:53,685
said that to FDA.

945
00:46:53,705 --> 00:46:55,870
The federal government
is again going to look

946
00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:59,840
into the safety of the fillings
that tens of millions of us

947
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:01,170
already have.

948
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:03,610
The fillings in question
are the silver kind.

949
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:06,970
And the concern here is
mercury, which is an ingredient.

950
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:10,660
The American Dental Association
insists the fillings are safe,

951
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:13,120
but many people believe
the mercury can lead

952
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:14,310
to serious health problems.

953
00:47:17,525 --> 00:47:19,270
I'm going to take the dog for a walk.

954
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:20,290
OK.

955
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:37,150
Our whole lives changed because of this.

956
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:40,540
In the beginning, it was hard
for him to understand this too.

957
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:43,810
And I was lucky that Nick
went to a health conference

958
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:46,360
and a holistic dentist was there.

959
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:47,590
And he lectured.

960
00:47:47,610 --> 00:47:50,260
And then my husband came home
and took his retirement money

961
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,750
out, so that I could get chelation.

962
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:56,560
That was the first time
that I got the chelation.

963
00:47:56,580 --> 00:48:01,390
So yes, he's been really supportive,

964
00:48:01,410 --> 00:48:03,190
amazingly supportive.

965
00:48:06,515 --> 00:48:08,740
When you get something like this,

966
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,900
you just to go crawl in a hole
and just say, to heck with it,

967
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:12,701
I'm out.

968
00:48:12,721 --> 00:48:15,010
See ya.

969
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:18,340
I mean, I never could have made
it through this without Chris.

970
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:20,470
I mean, he is so strong.

971
00:48:20,490 --> 00:48:22,810
He's strong in his faith.

972
00:48:22,830 --> 00:48:25,030
He's strong emotionally.

973
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:27,610
He just kept encouraging me and telling me,

974
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:29,060
it's going to be OK.

975
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:30,650
We've got such a great marriage.

976
00:48:30,670 --> 00:48:33,070
I mean, she's my best friend.

977
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:34,180
It just doesn't matter.

978
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:38,660
Nothing's going to get between
us, including a sickness.

979
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:44,290
I know how sick she feels,
and I just try to do whatever I

980
00:48:44,310 --> 00:48:45,141
can to help her.

981
00:48:45,161 --> 00:48:46,590
And I think she appreciates that.

982
00:48:55,022 --> 00:48:57,990
It has affected our relationship.

983
00:48:58,010 --> 00:49:01,038
And our life is totally upside down.

984
00:49:01,058 --> 00:49:03,330
Well, it was a good defining
moment in our marriage.

985
00:49:03,350 --> 00:49:06,720
Because when you get married,
what are the vows, you know?

986
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:09,165
There's sickness and in health, right?

987
00:49:09,185 --> 00:49:11,890
Every step of the way, it's
like, it's going to be fine.

988
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:12,691
We're good.

989
00:49:12,711 --> 00:49:14,500
We're together.

990
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:15,300
I'm not leaving.

991
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:16,101
I love you.

992
00:49:16,121 --> 00:49:17,800
I don't care if you're in a wheelchair.

993
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:20,250
I don't care if I have to pick you up.

994
00:49:20,270 --> 00:49:23,516
We're just going to pick you up
and take you where we're going

995
00:49:23,536 --> 00:49:27,170
I did what I had to do to be
a supportive husband in every

996
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:27,971
way possible.

997
00:49:27,991 --> 00:49:29,890
So it wasn't that big of a deal.

998
00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:31,090
It's what I signed up for.

999
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:32,970
And it's the way it should be.

1000
00:49:32,990 --> 00:49:39,030
I'm glad that he had the
foresight to see farther down

1001
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:46,156
the road and to not be
as frightened as I was.

1002
00:49:46,176 --> 00:49:50,410
It's brought us closer in some ways.

1003
00:49:50,430 --> 00:49:52,900
But there's days when, you
know, it catches up to me,

1004
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:53,851
catches up to her.

1005
00:49:53,871 --> 00:49:56,720
It's like, we all want just go to bed

1006
00:49:56,740 --> 00:50:00,060
and try to hope that
tomorrow will be better.

1007
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:05,532
But it's not always easy.

1008
00:50:12,504 --> 00:50:15,330
We're going to go to Walmart
and pick up some material

1009
00:50:15,350 --> 00:50:20,550
to make a box, so we can
video mercury leaving a dental

1010
00:50:20,570 --> 00:50:25,800
amalgam, like you would do in
a general chemistry experiment.

1011
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:29,490
The most uneducated person is
going to look at that and say,

1012
00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:32,580
that is mercury vapor coming
off of an amalgam that's

1013
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:36,370
been in my mouth for 20 years.

1014
00:50:36,390 --> 00:50:38,520
This is a really inexpensive experiment

1015
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:41,780
that the ADA and the FDA can
do this with their lunch money.

1016
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:48,400
And yet, they refuse to do it.

1017
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,483
And they'll even make
claims that what we're doing

1018
00:50:50,503 --> 00:50:51,680
can't be repeated.

1019
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:54,330
And it's something that's done
in so many general chemistry

1020
00:50:54,350 --> 00:50:58,376
laboratories that you can't
deny what it's measuring.

1021
00:51:01,570 --> 00:51:04,200
Dr. Matt Young and I are
going to make this box

1022
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:05,220
and demonstrate this.

1023
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:20,360
Hello, Matty.

1024
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:20,940
Oh, hey, boy.

1025
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:21,700
Good to see you again.

1026
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:22,440
Glad to have you.

1027
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:22,900
Thanks for coming.

1028
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:23,701
Yeah.

1029
00:51:23,721 --> 00:51:25,080
My pleasure.

1030
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:26,120
It's mercury vapor.

1031
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:28,170
You can't see it in the daylight.

1032
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:31,400
And if you breathe it, you can't
taste it, you can't smell it.

1033
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:34,550
So what we're hoping is that when

1034
00:51:34,570 --> 00:51:38,080
we make visuals showing this
mercury vapor rolling off

1035
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:41,510
of these amalgams when you put a
drill on them, that the dentist

1036
00:51:41,530 --> 00:51:44,130
will all of a sudden, oh, my
god, these guys aren't lying.

1037
00:51:44,150 --> 00:51:45,800
There's a lot of mercury coming off.

1038
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:48,140
We can visually show it.

1039
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:51,480
And this is an approach that's
been developed by chemists,

1040
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:53,770
who activate a mercury lamp.

1041
00:51:53,790 --> 00:51:56,210
A mercury lamp is a lamp
that contains mercury vapor

1042
00:51:56,230 --> 00:51:57,860
that you run a current through.

1043
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:01,670
And that mercury emits a
light of a special wavelength

1044
00:52:01,690 --> 00:52:03,690
that water and air will not absorb.

1045
00:52:03,710 --> 00:52:06,500
However, if you place in front of that lamp

1046
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:09,350
an amalgam in a tooth and
you activate that tooth

1047
00:52:09,370 --> 00:52:11,540
by brushing it, then millions and millions

1048
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:14,360
of atoms of mercury come off of that tooth.

1049
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:17,540
When the atom of mercury
gets in between the screen

1050
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:21,920
and the lamp, it absorbs that
photon and blocks that light.

1051
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:24,620
And it looks like there is a shadow made

1052
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:27,410
on the screen where the
mercury is absorbing the light.

1053
00:52:27,430 --> 00:52:29,870
So what you're seeing
is really an absorbance

1054
00:52:29,890 --> 00:52:31,760
of the photon by the mercury atom

1055
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:34,796
that reflects as a shadow on the screen.

1056
00:52:34,816 --> 00:52:38,205
In addition, there's a lot
of skeptics out there that think

1057
00:52:38,225 --> 00:52:40,580
this is water vapor coming
off the teeth and not actually

1058
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:41,541
mercury.

1059
00:52:41,561 --> 00:52:43,190
We want to prove once and for all

1060
00:52:43,210 --> 00:52:45,740
that it's actually mercury
vapor that's coming off.

1061
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:49,248
We also have a hole in the
top of the box with which we

1062
00:52:49,268 --> 00:52:50,166
will insert our probe.

1063
00:52:50,186 --> 00:52:52,700
And this is going to
go to the mercury 3,000

1064
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,462
mass spectrophotometer.

1065
00:52:54,482 --> 00:52:56,420
And this is going to go
into the top of the box

1066
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:59,630
like this, so that a sample of
the air during these procedures

1067
00:52:59,650 --> 00:53:01,378
can be measured accurately.

1068
00:53:07,323 --> 00:53:09,220
Are you prepared to take the oath, Senator?

1069
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:10,201
I am.

1070
00:53:10,221 --> 00:53:14,742
I, Barack Hussein Obama do solemnly swear--

1071
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:22,490
I will not back down
from protecting our kids

1072
00:53:22,510 --> 00:53:24,776
from mercury poisoning.

1073
00:53:24,796 --> 00:53:28,490
While the FDA was working
on the classification,

1074
00:53:28,510 --> 00:53:31,370
newly elected President
Obama had nominated Dr.

1075
00:53:31,390 --> 00:53:34,250
Margaret Hamburg to be
commissioner of the FDA.

1076
00:53:34,270 --> 00:53:38,210
It is a privilege to be here
today to discuss my nomination

1077
00:53:38,230 --> 00:53:41,450
as commissioner of the Food
and Drug Administration.

1078
00:53:41,470 --> 00:53:43,970
To me, this means operating an agency that

1079
00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:46,160
is accessible and transparent.

1080
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:49,610
The FDA has responsibility to
ensure that its work is given

1081
00:53:49,630 --> 00:53:53,930
by the best possible science and
is undertaken with integrity,

1082
00:53:53,950 --> 00:53:56,060
openness, and credibility.

1083
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:58,760
I'm happy to answer any
questions that you may have.

1084
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:00,530
Senator Enzi is going to--

1085
00:54:00,550 --> 00:54:02,120
During her confirmation hearing,

1086
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:04,610
she was asked of her
position on dental amalgam.

1087
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:08,068
She's asked about the rule
in the Senate confirmation.

1088
00:54:08,088 --> 00:54:10,110
She should have said, I'm
recused from that rule.

1089
00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:10,941
Instead she didn't.

1090
00:54:10,961 --> 00:54:14,660
Dr. Hamburg failed to
disclose to Senator Enzi that

1091
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:17,270
she was a board member of Henry Schein,

1092
00:54:17,290 --> 00:54:20,780
the largest distributor
of amalgam in the US.

1093
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,610
After her appointment was confirmed,

1094
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:25,940
Dr. Hamburg inherited the
oversight of the amalgam rule

1095
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:28,340
already in progress at the FDA.

1096
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:31,040
Hamburg had a conflict that
should have resulted in her

1097
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:33,040
dismissal as commissioner.

1098
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:35,750
They made her sign an
ethics contract that said,

1099
00:54:35,770 --> 00:54:38,030
I will not participate
in any matter affecting

1100
00:54:38,050 --> 00:54:41,525
Henry Schein as long as I own
the stock or stock options.

1101
00:54:41,545 --> 00:54:43,400
So she checked the price
of her stock options

1102
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:44,983
a day before the meeting that she knew

1103
00:54:45,003 --> 00:54:46,490
was being held, July 1.

1104
00:54:46,510 --> 00:54:49,520
She had the meeting to discuss
the amalgam rule with Susan

1105
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:51,920
Runner and other top FDA staff.

1106
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:54,260
She went ahead and worked
on the Henry Schein rule

1107
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:55,850
while she owned the stock options.

1108
00:54:55,870 --> 00:54:58,610
In mid July, she said,
OK, I'll recuse myself

1109
00:54:58,630 --> 00:54:59,960
for ethical reasons.

1110
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:02,780
She will not disclose
how she recused herself,

1111
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:05,480
when she recused herself,
whether she recused herself.

1112
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:06,772
We take their word for it.

1113
00:55:06,792 --> 00:55:09,230
You understand, a recusal is
normally a written phenomenon.

1114
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:10,730
The judge says, I'm off this case.

1115
00:55:10,750 --> 00:55:12,530
The commissioner says, I'm off this case.

1116
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:14,750
She never wrote down anything.

1117
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:17,378
Hamburg in the final weeks before the rule,

1118
00:55:17,398 --> 00:55:18,920
wrote Henry Schein's lawyer and said,

1119
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:20,200
I want to unrecuse myself.

1120
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:22,220
Will you take back the stock options?

1121
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,785
I want to get back in and regulate for you.

1122
00:55:24,805 --> 00:55:26,180
I want to regulate for you.

1123
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:29,150
I want it in my recusal
of anything affecting you,

1124
00:55:29,170 --> 00:55:31,878
so I can go back, take
my stock options back.

1125
00:55:31,898 --> 00:55:33,190
And the guy was happy to do it.

1126
00:55:41,170 --> 00:55:44,540
I knew from my research that
getting the fillings out alone

1127
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:48,290
was not enough, because the
mercury from the fillings is

1128
00:55:48,310 --> 00:55:50,780
stored in your tissue.

1129
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:53,930
And it particularly likes
the central nervous system.

1130
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:57,470
So I knew that I needed to
take that next step in trying

1131
00:55:57,490 --> 00:56:00,650
to decide, do I really
need to get chelation?

1132
00:56:00,670 --> 00:56:02,420
And if so, how do I go about this?

1133
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:06,440
And I never would have
figured all of this out

1134
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:08,700
if it weren't for God's guiding hand.

1135
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:17,050
I never will forget,
one day I was at the Y.

1136
00:56:17,070 --> 00:56:19,760
And I'd finished my workout, and
I'm just praying and meditating

1137
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:20,561
it.

1138
00:56:20,581 --> 00:56:24,350
I'm just saying, you know, God,
if I'm not supposed to do this,

1139
00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:25,930
just let me know.

1140
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:28,390
I mean, I'm already better
without these fillings in.

1141
00:56:28,410 --> 00:56:30,470
I can already feel my body's calm down.

1142
00:56:30,490 --> 00:56:32,020
It's not as agitated.

1143
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:33,700
And I'm not twitching as much.

1144
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:36,830
But I'm good, I can
live with what I've got.

1145
00:56:36,850 --> 00:56:39,930
And if I'm not supposed
to do anything else,

1146
00:56:39,950 --> 00:56:43,720
if I'm not supposed to go
get chelation or pursue

1147
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:45,620
any other experimental
treatments, I'm good.

1148
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:46,420
Just let me know.

1149
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:47,221
Give me a sign.

1150
00:56:47,241 --> 00:56:49,970
Just give me a sign that
I'm on the right track.

1151
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:52,150
And at the place where I work out,

1152
00:56:52,170 --> 00:56:56,080
they have a basket of Bible
verses as you walk out.

1153
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:58,180
And they call it the spiritual vitamin.

1154
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:01,361
And I grabbed one on the way out that day.

1155
00:57:01,381 --> 00:57:09,381
And it said, you will know the truth.

1156
00:57:10,370 --> 00:57:13,100
The truth will set you free.

1157
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:15,179
And I knew.

1158
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:28,201
These treatments were IV treatments.

1159
00:57:28,221 --> 00:57:30,190
And I did it for a couple of years.

1160
00:57:30,210 --> 00:57:33,330
And then my veins collapsed.

1161
00:57:33,350 --> 00:57:35,120
I had no veins left.

1162
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:36,380
I couldn't do it anymore.

1163
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,560
So even if I had the money, I don't even

1164
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:42,991
know if I could get chelation
at this stage of the game.

1165
00:57:43,011 --> 00:57:47,230
If you've had a bad amalgam
removal or a period where you

1166
00:57:47,250 --> 00:57:51,850
had high mercury exposure, often
long after that mercury you are

1167
00:57:51,870 --> 00:57:56,410
exposed to is gone, the
damage from that remains.

1168
00:57:56,430 --> 00:57:58,820
I don't know what to say, what to do.

1169
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:00,670
I mean, this has been a long haul.

1170
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:05,560
I've been sick now for 15 years.

1171
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:08,260
There's so many days out
of year that I can't even

1172
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:09,870
get out of bed.

1173
00:58:09,890 --> 00:58:12,070
You know, every day, you wake up and you

1174
00:58:12,090 --> 00:58:16,230
feel like you have the
flu, flu-like symptoms.

1175
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:18,220
And you're just sick as a dog.

1176
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,628
And you push yourself, push yourself,

1177
00:58:20,648 --> 00:58:22,420
push yourself, because you want to maintain

1178
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:24,780
what little life you can.

1179
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:28,000
My big concern was A,
for her health, but, B,

1180
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:33,160
also for whether or not she was
going down a rabbit's hole with

1181
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:34,366
no end.

1182
00:58:34,386 --> 00:58:38,674
And that's-- I may still
feel that way to some degree.

1183
00:58:38,694 --> 00:58:44,350
I don't see in my lifetime
it ever getting straightened out

1184
00:58:44,370 --> 00:58:47,670
and people ever believing
what happened to me.

1185
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:58,340
A recent study by the Food
and Drug Administration found

1186
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:01,250
no valid evidence that amalgams are unsafe.

1187
00:59:01,270 --> 00:59:04,370
That's great news for
patients and dentists alike.

1188
00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:08,300
The International Academy of
Oral Medicine and Toxicology,

1189
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:11,390
a scientific organization
made up of dental, medical,

1190
00:59:11,410 --> 00:59:14,630
and research professionals,
immediately started combing

1191
00:59:14,650 --> 00:59:18,050
through the new rule and
found many glaring errors,

1192
00:59:18,070 --> 00:59:20,810
all in favor of the safety of amalgam.

1193
00:59:20,830 --> 00:59:24,410
The petition for reconsideration challenged

1194
00:59:24,430 --> 00:59:28,970
the FDA final rule on regulatory
grounds and scientific grounds.

1195
00:59:28,990 --> 00:59:31,490
We found 27 propositions of error,

1196
00:59:31,510 --> 00:59:34,953
and I mean big errors,
in the FDA's final rule.

1197
00:59:34,973 --> 00:59:37,370
The public doesn't know it,
because public doesn't keep up

1198
00:59:37,390 --> 00:59:38,171
with this.

1199
00:59:38,191 --> 00:59:39,230
But the FDA knows it.

1200
00:59:39,250 --> 00:59:41,730
Amalgam somehow gets a free pass.

1201
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:42,840
I don't understand it.

1202
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:45,520
And I can only assume that it's
political influence brought

1203
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:48,220
by the FDA that's causing
these aberrant results.

1204
00:59:51,166 --> 00:59:53,740
Not everyone agrees
with the new Food and Drug

1205
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,120
Administration report that's out this week.

1206
00:59:56,140 --> 00:59:58,910
It says, silver dental fillings are safe.

1207
00:59:58,930 --> 00:59:59,711
In fact, an FDA--

1208
00:59:59,731 --> 01:00:03,250
The final rule of the
classification was a huge

1209
01:00:03,270 --> 01:00:05,470
disappointment to health advocates,

1210
01:00:05,490 --> 01:00:08,920
as it declared the mercury vapor
released from amalgam fillings

1211
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:11,310
to be safe for anyone and everyone.

1212
01:00:14,315 --> 01:00:15,670
With the news that there would be

1213
01:00:15,690 --> 01:00:21,020
no constraints upon the product,
Henry Schein's stock soared.

1214
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:24,050
Hamburg writes him the day
the rule comes out and says,

1215
01:00:24,070 --> 01:00:28,460
my friendships with Henry
Schein outlasts my recusal,

1216
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:31,790
my friendships outlast my recusals.

1217
01:00:31,810 --> 01:00:34,400
Schein's stock jumps a buck and a half.

1218
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:37,760
July 30, the general counsel
writes Margaret Hamburg,

1219
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:40,100
we are indebted to you for
your work as commissioner.

1220
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:41,270
We are indebted to you.

1221
01:00:41,290 --> 01:00:44,150
That's the kind of thing
that happens in Washington that

1222
01:00:44,170 --> 01:00:47,480
creates in everybody's mind
that we're all corrupt up here.

1223
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:51,260
Well, I'm Congressman Dan
Burton from the 5th district

1224
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:52,400
of Indiana.

1225
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:55,130
And when you find out that
government officials, who

1226
01:00:55,150 --> 01:00:58,130
are making decisions regarding
the health of the nation,

1227
01:00:58,150 --> 01:01:02,982
are doing questionable things,
it only adds to the problem.

1228
01:01:03,002 --> 01:01:04,940
People should have
confidence in the government

1229
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:07,080
that we're trying to do
the best we can for them.

1230
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:09,500
And if the head of the FDA has stock

1231
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:11,920
in a company that makes dental amalgams

1232
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:15,720
and they're making rulings, they
should be recusing themselves.

1233
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:17,450
And if they don't, I think that they're

1234
01:01:17,470 --> 01:01:18,950
guilty of criminal activity.

1235
01:01:18,970 --> 01:01:21,345
And the reason I say that is because I

1236
01:01:21,365 --> 01:01:23,720
am convinced after having been
the chairman of government

1237
01:01:23,740 --> 01:01:26,060
reform and oversight for six years

1238
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:28,490
and had numerous hearings on the subject

1239
01:01:28,510 --> 01:01:31,070
that the mercury in the amalgam does cause

1240
01:01:31,090 --> 01:01:33,530
human neurological problems.

1241
01:01:33,550 --> 01:01:37,336
She should not be FDA
commissioner, absolutely not.

1242
01:01:56,090 --> 01:02:01,260
I literally put myself in
that doctor's hand and just

1243
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:02,550
went with it.

1244
01:02:02,570 --> 01:02:04,680
I am seeing an osteopathic doctor,

1245
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:08,700
began intravenous
chelation of EDTA and DMPS.

1246
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:10,153
It's kind of like chemotherapy.

1247
01:02:10,173 --> 01:02:11,071
That's what it's like.

1248
01:02:11,091 --> 01:02:12,870
You get an injection, you get an IV,

1249
01:02:12,890 --> 01:02:15,230
and you just kind of sit
there for a couple of hours.

1250
01:02:15,250 --> 01:02:16,680
And there's this big bag of liquid

1251
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:17,865
being poured into your body.

1252
01:02:17,885 --> 01:02:21,670
And it's frightening.

1253
01:02:21,690 --> 01:02:24,430
And I made it through the
whole day, and I felt normal.

1254
01:02:24,450 --> 01:02:26,920
And then I slept great
and woke up the next day,

1255
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:29,090
and I thought, well, OK, I survived it.

1256
01:02:29,110 --> 01:02:30,752
There must be something to this.

1257
01:02:30,772 --> 01:02:32,960
Then I went back for my next
treatment the next week.

1258
01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:34,710
And then I started feeling so much better.

1259
01:02:34,730 --> 01:02:36,890
I mean, I just had like
an extra kick in my step.

1260
01:02:36,910 --> 01:02:40,360
I'm thinking, OK, I'm onto something here.

1261
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:43,540
And each treatment just reinforced

1262
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:45,430
what I had researched in.

1263
01:02:45,450 --> 01:02:47,050
And it may not work for everybody.

1264
01:02:47,070 --> 01:02:49,120
And I'm certainly not saying that it will.

1265
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:50,770
And I think that there's something

1266
01:02:50,790 --> 01:02:52,450
to be said of starting early.

1267
01:02:52,470 --> 01:02:54,800
In my case, we arrested it early.

1268
01:02:54,820 --> 01:02:58,043
We arrested it, contained
it, stopped it, and I'm good.

1269
01:02:58,063 --> 01:02:59,710
But there's some people who've been sick

1270
01:02:59,730 --> 01:03:00,628
for a long, long time.

1271
01:03:00,648 --> 01:03:02,710
And it's hard to reverse damage if it's

1272
01:03:02,730 --> 01:03:04,820
been going on for a long time.

1273
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:07,090
I definitely felt vindicated.

1274
01:03:07,110 --> 01:03:09,160
And I think I told my husband that.

1275
01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:10,780
I said, oh, I feel so vindicated.

1276
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:13,120
I said, now, I mean, look
at me, I'm so much better

1277
01:03:13,140 --> 01:03:14,600
and I can't even believe it.

1278
01:03:14,620 --> 01:03:16,540
I feel like I'm not
crazy anymore, you know?

1279
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:19,040
I feel like this is valid.

1280
01:03:19,060 --> 01:03:19,901
This is real.

1281
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:21,400
More people need to know about this.

1282
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:22,570
And that's when my husband started saying,

1283
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:23,820
well, you need to tell people.

1284
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:26,410
He'd say, honey, you know,
you sure are doing good.

1285
01:03:26,430 --> 01:03:28,720
You really need to tell people about this.

1286
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:37,012
This morning is the open public hearing.

1287
01:03:37,032 --> 01:03:38,095
Could you state your name?

1288
01:03:38,115 --> 01:03:40,690
My name is Karen Burns.

1289
01:03:40,710 --> 01:03:45,340
And I was a dental assistant for 24 years,

1290
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:47,430
until I couldn't work anymore.

1291
01:03:50,190 --> 01:03:52,930
When I first started dental assisting,

1292
01:03:52,950 --> 01:03:56,020
we didn't wear a mask or gloves.

1293
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:59,600
We had a bottle of
mercury and silver pellets

1294
01:03:59,620 --> 01:04:02,740
that we put together by hand.

1295
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:07,960
We didn't understand that
these vapors were everywhere.

1296
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:11,590
You must see the damage that it's doing.

1297
01:04:11,610 --> 01:04:14,200
Why should anyone have to
suffer this illness when

1298
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:17,170
it can be totally eradicated?

1299
01:04:17,190 --> 01:04:21,490
I hope you people just listen
and find it in your heart

1300
01:04:21,510 --> 01:04:23,990
to really consider all of this.

1301
01:04:24,010 --> 01:04:25,760
It's a real thing.

1302
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:26,780
Thank you.

1303
01:04:34,532 --> 01:04:38,380
For the most part, I
generally approached it with

1304
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:39,550
a skeptical eye.

1305
01:04:39,570 --> 01:04:41,620
And I did not do that necessarily

1306
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:46,660
because of any ill will, but
because sometimes if you follow

1307
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:48,580
a certain orthodoxy that's wrong,

1308
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:52,510
whether it be a flat Earth
theory or anything else,

1309
01:04:52,530 --> 01:04:53,890
you're not getting to truth.

1310
01:04:53,910 --> 01:04:56,410
And of course, I think in the
end, you're looking for truth.

1311
01:05:00,850 --> 01:05:03,970
We just finished constructing
our visualization box,

1312
01:05:03,990 --> 01:05:06,340
which is made out of everyday
materials that you can get

1313
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:08,410
in any hardware store.

1314
01:05:08,430 --> 01:05:10,300
Typically in most dental schools,

1315
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:11,830
it's been taught that the mercury is

1316
01:05:11,850 --> 01:05:14,530
trapped within the matrix of the amalgam.

1317
01:05:14,550 --> 01:05:17,050
And so therefore, we're trying
to visualize here and prove

1318
01:05:17,070 --> 01:05:19,330
the fact that there is a
significant amount that

1319
01:05:19,350 --> 01:05:21,710
comes off during the
mixing, during the packing.

1320
01:05:21,730 --> 01:05:24,010
And then we'd have some
teeth with the amalgam

1321
01:05:24,030 --> 01:05:25,180
that's been set for a while.

1322
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:26,230
And we're going to be removing that

1323
01:05:26,250 --> 01:05:28,202
with a high-speed dental drill in order

1324
01:05:28,222 --> 01:05:31,130
to visualize how much vapor
comes off during that procedure

1325
01:05:31,150 --> 01:05:31,931
as well.

1326
01:05:31,951 --> 01:05:33,790
The American Dental Association has made

1327
01:05:33,810 --> 01:05:36,370
the argument that mercury is
fixed in the amalgam fillings

1328
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:40,040
and it doesn't come out easily.

1329
01:05:40,060 --> 01:05:42,950
And what this research that
we're doing here visually shows

1330
01:05:42,970 --> 01:05:45,650
is that, when you drill
on an amalgam filling,

1331
01:05:45,670 --> 01:05:48,620
that it dramatically exposes
the patient, and the dentist,

1332
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:51,290
and the dental technician to
huge amounts of mercury vapor

1333
01:05:51,310 --> 01:05:53,280
that enters the body.

1334
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:55,395
It's even worse than what they imagined.

1335
01:05:55,415 --> 01:05:58,930
2,483 micrograms per cubic meter,

1336
01:05:58,950 --> 01:06:01,130
and I've never seen levels
of mercury this high.

1337
01:06:01,150 --> 01:06:03,810
That's pretty much unheard of
in any type of work environment.

1338
01:06:03,830 --> 01:06:07,560
Because it definitely
shows with just absolute fact,

1339
01:06:07,580 --> 01:06:11,670
hard science that amalgams when
they are heated with the drill

1340
01:06:11,690 --> 01:06:15,120
by drilling on them release
copious amounts of mercury,

1341
01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:16,470
of vapor into the air.

1342
01:06:16,490 --> 01:06:18,847
Clearly, if you're not measuring it,

1343
01:06:18,867 --> 01:06:21,180
you're not monitoring it, and
you're not educating these

1344
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:24,220
employees, then the OSHA
regulations are not being

1345
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:25,021
upheld.

1346
01:06:25,041 --> 01:06:27,720
And so I just ask the ADA,
don't you care about your own

1347
01:06:27,740 --> 01:06:28,521
people?

1348
01:06:28,541 --> 01:06:30,900
I mean, these are people
who are members of the FDA.

1349
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:34,070
And you're exposing them to
high levels of mercury vapor

1350
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:36,410
by its still supporting
the use of dental amalgams.

1351
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:43,030
The ADA's message is just simple.

1352
01:06:43,050 --> 01:06:45,540
And it's been this for many, many years.

1353
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:49,620
And that is that amalgam
is a safe and effective

1354
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:51,150
dental material.

1355
01:06:51,170 --> 01:06:53,910
It's disconcerting that,
despite all the regulations

1356
01:06:53,930 --> 01:06:55,680
regarding mercury in the workplace,

1357
01:06:55,700 --> 01:06:57,900
mainstream dentistry still
promotes these fillings

1358
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:58,861
as perfectly safe.

1359
01:06:58,881 --> 01:07:00,650
The science hasn't changed.

1360
01:07:00,670 --> 01:07:03,683
The science has been this way for decades.

1361
01:07:03,703 --> 01:07:05,100
Unfortunately, there's some groups

1362
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:06,810
who don't accept the science, who

1363
01:07:06,830 --> 01:07:09,210
like to rely on fear and other factors.

1364
01:07:09,230 --> 01:07:14,040
The ADA is a group that just
dismisses and denies without

1365
01:07:14,060 --> 01:07:15,150
doing any experiments.

1366
01:07:15,170 --> 01:07:17,370
They could be doing the same
experiments we're doing,

1367
01:07:17,390 --> 01:07:19,080
showing that mercury doesn't come off.

1368
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:20,800
I want to see them do that.

1369
01:07:20,820 --> 01:07:24,150
What patient safety and science shows us,

1370
01:07:24,170 --> 01:07:27,150
what science shows us now
is that patient safety is

1371
01:07:27,170 --> 01:07:29,930
absolutely protected with
general amalgam material.

1372
01:07:29,950 --> 01:07:32,600
When a dentist goes in to
grind down the amalgam filling,

1373
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:35,640
he is creating tremendous
quantities of mercury

1374
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:36,912
particulate.

1375
01:07:36,932 --> 01:07:39,590
So for that period of time they're working,

1376
01:07:39,610 --> 01:07:44,330
they're 100-fold over the
recommended levels for air

1377
01:07:44,350 --> 01:07:45,710
in a workplace.

1378
01:07:45,730 --> 01:07:47,718
It's no wonder that people like Karen

1379
01:07:47,738 --> 01:07:50,135
are going to have an issue
with being in that environment.

1380
01:07:50,155 --> 01:07:53,675
I don't believe that the vapors that are--

1381
01:07:53,695 --> 01:07:56,860
the come off from the removal
of an amalgam are going to put

1382
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:58,340
a patient in harm's way.

1383
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:01,430
Nor do I believe it will
put me in harm's way,

1384
01:08:01,450 --> 01:08:04,580
although we have masks, of course,

1385
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:06,190
that to some degree protect us.

1386
01:08:06,210 --> 01:08:08,690
In dental school, they taught
us nothing about protecting

1387
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:11,190
the dentist, the staff, or
the patients from the dangers

1388
01:08:11,210 --> 01:08:12,210
of mercury vapor.

1389
01:08:23,487 --> 01:08:26,970
Dental schools ought to
be fearful of major lawsuits,

1390
01:08:26,990 --> 01:08:31,320
because this is not a secret anymore.

1391
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:32,490
You can see it coming out.

1392
01:08:32,510 --> 01:08:34,799
I mean, the exposure to
mercury to those people

1393
01:08:34,819 --> 01:08:36,112
is just tremendous.

1394
01:08:43,664 --> 01:08:46,950
We are turning now to the
OSHA Hazard Communication

1395
01:08:46,970 --> 01:08:49,950
Standard this is a final regulation.

1396
01:08:49,970 --> 01:08:53,565
And there is no escape
for it, for any of us.

1397
01:08:53,585 --> 01:08:57,330
Everyone walking around
hazardous chemicals and other

1398
01:08:57,350 --> 01:09:01,500
toxic substances has a right
to know of possible dangers

1399
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:03,239
and how to protect themselves.

1400
01:09:03,259 --> 01:09:06,839
Health care professionals and
folks all over the country are

1401
01:09:06,859 --> 01:09:10,140
asking the Food and Drug
Administration to protect

1402
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:13,709
and inform the public about
the potential dangers of silver

1403
01:09:13,729 --> 01:09:15,000
amalgam fillings.

1404
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:17,640
Those include my colleague Stacy Case.

1405
01:09:17,660 --> 01:09:19,740
Now, we've been following
Stacy's personal story

1406
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:22,500
for months now, telling
you about her diagnosis

1407
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:26,100
with multiple sclerosis after
a routine dental procedure.

1408
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:29,700
And tonight, Stacy is in San
Francisco sharing her story

1409
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:31,574
with the federal government.

1410
01:09:31,594 --> 01:09:35,459
Nearly four years ago, I let
a dentist talk me into having

1411
01:09:35,479 --> 01:09:39,959
four 30-year-old silver mercury
fillings replaced because he

1412
01:09:39,979 --> 01:09:41,850
said they were cracked.

1413
01:09:41,870 --> 01:09:44,160
Your agency at the time, though, the FDA,

1414
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:46,980
had done nothing to warn me,
an educated professional,

1415
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
that this was a health hazard.

1416
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:52,049
This is a great injustice.

1417
01:09:52,069 --> 01:09:55,740
Seven months after that dental
work, I got out of bed one

1418
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,750
morning and could not walk.

1419
01:09:57,770 --> 01:10:01,710
My children were two and three at the time.

1420
01:10:01,730 --> 01:10:04,620
My immediate concern was,
will I be caring for them

1421
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:07,620
or will it be the other way around?

1422
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:11,100
I now know that I and
millions of other Americans

1423
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:14,380
are genetically predisposed
to autoimmune disease.

1424
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:19,200
And these mercury fillings
are the trigger in many cases.

1425
01:10:19,220 --> 01:10:21,750
I read several dozen scientific studies.

1426
01:10:21,770 --> 01:10:25,020
One such study, 1990 University of Denmark,

1427
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:28,530
proved monkeys with mercury dental fillings

1428
01:10:28,550 --> 01:10:32,100
stored it in their spinal
ganglia, pituitary gland,

1429
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:33,360
and many other organs.

1430
01:10:33,380 --> 01:10:37,740
This stuff seeps into the body
from the day it is implanted.

1431
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:39,660
Then one day, you reach the tipping point,

1432
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:43,630
like I did, and disease sets in.

1433
01:10:43,650 --> 01:10:47,440
Your hand-picked
scientists in 2006 and 2010

1434
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:50,470
have made you keenly
aware of the health risks

1435
01:10:50,490 --> 01:10:52,000
and the disease causation.

1436
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:55,660
Please do not ignore them
or injured consumers like me

1437
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:56,621
any longer.

1438
01:10:56,641 --> 01:10:58,787
You really want to help
this country get health care

1439
01:10:58,807 --> 01:10:59,940
costs under control?

1440
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:01,260
Ban amalgam.

1441
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:04,140
You really want to see a cure
for many autoimmune diseases?

1442
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:05,141
Ban amalgam.

1443
01:11:05,161 --> 01:11:07,180
You really want to ensure American moms

1444
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:10,060
like me can play chase with
their children in the yard?

1445
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:11,410
Ban amalgam.

1446
01:11:11,430 --> 01:11:14,330
After two decades in the news
business, I know the truth.

1447
01:11:14,350 --> 01:11:18,250
And the truth is silver mercury
fillings are causing disease.

1448
01:11:18,270 --> 01:11:21,220
And they are making people
sick, keeping them sick,

1449
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:22,930
so help me God.

1450
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:25,840
Use your power and position
for good, Dr. Shuren.

1451
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:26,711
Leave a legacy.

1452
01:11:26,731 --> 01:11:29,490
Please right this wrong.

1453
01:11:29,510 --> 01:11:31,720
We've gone back and we
looked at the evidence.

1454
01:11:31,740 --> 01:11:33,460
And what I can tell you is we intend

1455
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:36,600
to come out with an announcement
by the end of this year.

1456
01:11:36,620 --> 01:11:40,940
Since that missed deadline,
the FDA has been silent

1457
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:43,632
on where the ruling stands.

1458
01:11:43,652 --> 01:11:46,190
Obviously, this has
been an emotional journey,

1459
01:11:46,210 --> 01:11:47,530
but an important one.

1460
01:11:47,550 --> 01:11:51,520
And I just hope that my
story affects change.

1461
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:52,980
In San Francisco, Stacy Case.

1462
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Scott, back to you.

1463
01:11:54,790 --> 01:11:56,910
We've gone back and we
looked at the evidence.

1464
01:11:56,930 --> 01:11:58,650
And what I can tell you is we intend

1465
01:11:58,670 --> 01:12:01,680
to come out with an announcement
by the end of this year.

1466
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:04,530
And so 2011 came and went.

1467
01:12:04,550 --> 01:12:12,040
And sometime early in 2012,
I sent an email to my contact

1468
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:12,841
at FDA.

1469
01:12:12,861 --> 01:12:14,850
Response I got was, we'd love to respond,

1470
01:12:14,870 --> 01:12:19,590
we sent our document to HHS for approval.

1471
01:12:19,610 --> 01:12:23,490
And unfortunately, we don't
have a response back yet.

1472
01:12:23,510 --> 01:12:27,780
We sued FDA to compel them
to respond to our petitions

1473
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:31,960
after waiting very patiently
for five, six years.

1474
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:32,761
And they did so.

1475
01:12:32,781 --> 01:12:35,970
In January 2015, they came out
with a document that completely

1476
01:12:35,990 --> 01:12:41,730
affirmed what FDA had found in
2009, which was that mercury

1477
01:12:41,750 --> 01:12:43,960
fillings are completely safe.

1478
01:12:43,980 --> 01:12:49,290
We, my team, IAOMT team, we
were all deeply disappointed.

1479
01:12:49,310 --> 01:12:52,960
And then we get this
whistleblower document.

1480
01:12:52,980 --> 01:12:55,650
It was a document provided prohibitions

1481
01:12:55,670 --> 01:12:59,360
on placing mercury fillings
in tens of millions of people.

1482
01:13:02,660 --> 01:13:03,571
What happened here?

1483
01:13:03,591 --> 01:13:04,710
What happened?

1484
01:13:04,730 --> 01:13:08,490
HHS came back and provided
a political solution

1485
01:13:08,510 --> 01:13:10,950
to a thorny scientific problem.

1486
01:13:10,970 --> 01:13:15,270
HHS put the veto on
this statement of policy

1487
01:13:15,290 --> 01:13:18,120
that would have been published by FDA,

1488
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:20,890
but for HHS's political decision,

1489
01:13:20,910 --> 01:13:25,170
not scientific, political
decision to not change the way

1490
01:13:25,190 --> 01:13:26,790
the game was played.

1491
01:13:26,810 --> 01:13:28,830
But don't be deceived, there are hundreds

1492
01:13:28,850 --> 01:13:32,190
of peer-reviewed published,
scientific studies

1493
01:13:32,210 --> 01:13:35,580
by top authors that associate
the mercury in fillings

1494
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:37,500
with systemic disease.

1495
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:39,640
And so going forward,
what are we going to do?

1496
01:13:39,660 --> 01:13:43,290
We're going to go back to court
and take this document that

1497
01:13:43,310 --> 01:13:47,490
was issued way back in 2012 that
states what FDA really thought

1498
01:13:47,510 --> 01:13:51,868
about all this and ask the court
to reinstate the 2012 document.

1499
01:13:51,888 --> 01:13:52,888
That's our plan.

1500
01:13:59,162 --> 01:14:01,210
Good girl.

1501
01:14:01,230 --> 01:14:05,470
And so coming out here, just very relaxing.

1502
01:14:05,490 --> 01:14:08,110
Mandy.

1503
01:14:08,130 --> 01:14:09,550
She takes off.

1504
01:14:09,570 --> 01:14:11,450
And it's a real good working relationship.

1505
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:16,290
No one's ever put mercury
vapor in an animal that

1506
01:14:16,310 --> 01:14:17,640
didn't make that animal sick.

1507
01:14:17,660 --> 01:14:19,380
And yet, our government says, but you

1508
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:23,460
can't prove that it's toxic
just because it's there.

1509
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:24,361
The science is there.

1510
01:14:24,381 --> 01:14:25,560
It's very clear.

1511
01:14:25,580 --> 01:14:28,230
Anyone that has two neurons
left to rub together

1512
01:14:28,250 --> 01:14:31,110
can look at the research data and see

1513
01:14:31,130 --> 01:14:34,080
that mercury should not be
placed in the mouth of a child

1514
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:36,210
or to anyone.

1515
01:14:36,230 --> 01:14:38,850
And yet, you can't get an honest
discussion with our government

1516
01:14:38,870 --> 01:14:42,210
or with the medical
authorities about this problem.

1517
01:14:42,230 --> 01:14:45,780
We have not had any success,
taken to them the most solid

1518
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:48,740
science, and I mean tons of it.

1519
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:50,980
So, no, I'm upset about it.

1520
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,433
And the science is on my side.

1521
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:08,645
United Nations Environmental Programme

1522
01:15:08,665 --> 01:15:11,270
is eliminating mercury, because
all the scientists in the world

1523
01:15:11,290 --> 01:15:14,000
are worried about mercury
decreasing the health

1524
01:15:14,020 --> 01:15:15,970
of all humans from any source.

1525
01:15:18,980 --> 01:15:21,110
The overall treaty that was accepted

1526
01:15:21,130 --> 01:15:25,292
had amalgams as a product
that needs to be phased out.

1527
01:15:25,312 --> 01:15:26,750
And that's really great news to us,

1528
01:15:26,770 --> 01:15:28,667
because that means that
we're at the beginning

1529
01:15:28,687 --> 01:15:31,100
of the end for amalgam
fillings in the world.

1530
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:34,640
I think the job now is to
educate the American people.

1531
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:37,370
If you go to a dentist who
says the amalgam fillings are

1532
01:15:37,390 --> 01:15:39,380
safe and should be placed in your mouth,

1533
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:41,317
then you should find
yourself another dentist.

1534
01:15:48,896 --> 01:15:52,240
Despite a wealth of studies
showing the harm of mercury

1535
01:15:52,260 --> 01:15:55,930
as released from the product,
the American Dental Association

1536
01:15:55,950 --> 01:15:59,590
continues to promote the
safety of mercury fillings

1537
01:15:59,610 --> 01:16:03,430
and supports its use for anyone
and everyone without regard

1538
01:16:03,450 --> 01:16:08,680
for reproductive status, age,
or any of the known factors that

1539
01:16:08,700 --> 01:16:11,585
make a person unusually
susceptible to the effects

1540
01:16:11,605 --> 01:16:12,605
of mercury.

1541
01:16:32,350 --> 01:16:33,131
Hi.

1542
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:36,370
I'm Dr. Gerry Curatola of The
International Academy of Oral

1543
01:16:36,390 --> 01:16:38,310
Medicine and Toxicology.

1544
01:16:38,330 --> 01:16:40,060
Our organization has been a leader

1545
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:44,120
in mercury-safe dentistry
for over 30 years.

1546
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:46,420
I know it might be hard for some to fathom

1547
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:48,700
that measuring and visualizing mercury

1548
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:51,490
vapor during routine dental procedures

1549
01:16:51,510 --> 01:16:56,820
could be as easy as portrayed
in the movie, but it is.

1550
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:59,850
In fact, if you're skeptical
of the findings in the movie,

1551
01:16:59,870 --> 01:17:02,340
we encourage every dental professional

1552
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:05,682
to take the Mercury Measurement Challenge.

1553
01:17:05,702 --> 01:17:10,080
Our organization has partnered
with Mercury Instruments USA

1554
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:12,870
to offer a discounted
rental of their equipment

1555
01:17:12,890 --> 01:17:15,750
for any dentist who wants to
take the Mercury Measurement

1556
01:17:15,770 --> 01:17:16,980
Challenge.

1557
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:20,130
You will find that the
mercury vapor released

1558
01:17:20,150 --> 01:17:23,100
during the placement and removal
of dental amalgam fillings

1559
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:25,800
exceeds occupational safety limits that

1560
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:28,620
requires employee protection.

1561
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:31,140
The American Dental Association recommends

1562
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:33,420
that dentists periodically
monitor their office

1563
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:35,500
for dental mercury vapor.

1564
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:38,340
But that suggestion does not go far enough

1565
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:41,460
to make dentists truly aware
of the risks of working

1566
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:42,570
with mercury.

1567
01:17:42,590 --> 01:17:45,330
It is important for
every dental professional

1568
01:17:45,350 --> 01:17:48,960
to be aware of occupational
safety requirements

1569
01:17:48,980 --> 01:17:54,360
to protect and inform our
staff from any toxic exposure.

1570
01:17:54,380 --> 01:17:57,120
But it all starts with being informed.

1571
01:17:57,140 --> 01:17:59,310
I encourage you to visit The International

1572
01:17:59,330 --> 01:18:02,670
Academy of Oral Medicine
and Toxicology website.

1573
01:18:02,690 --> 01:18:10,050

1574
01:18:10,070 --> 01:18:11,610
Measurement Challenge.

1575
01:18:18,285 --> 01:18:20,870
<i>I watch it fall down to the ground,</i>

1576
01:18:20,890 --> 01:18:23,030
<i>cut off the things that weighed me down.</i>

1577
01:18:23,050 --> 01:18:25,610
<i>There's nothing left I'm
trying to hide, living</i>

1578
01:18:25,630 --> 01:18:27,480
<i>life now feeling free inside.</i>

1579
01:18:30,390 --> 01:18:31,430
<i>Feeling free inside.</i>

1580
01:18:35,129 --> 01:18:39,800
<i>I see the beauty of the sun,
another day has just begun.</i>

1581
01:18:39,820 --> 01:18:41,920
<i>I start to dream and start to see,</i>

1582
01:18:41,940 --> 01:18:44,160
<i>wonder what the world has for me.</i>

1583
01:18:46,860 --> 01:18:51,040
<i>What it has for me.</i>

1584
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:55,540
<i>So I'm moving on.</i>

1585
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:59,440
<i>I'm moving on.</i>

1586
01:18:59,460 --> 01:19:01,260
<i>And it feels wonderful.</i>

1587
01:19:04,260 --> 01:19:05,460
<i>Yeah, wonderful.</i>

1588
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:12,340
<i>I'm moving on.</i>

1589
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:15,940
<i>I'm moving on.</i>

1590
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:18,060
<i>And it feels wonderful.</i>

1591
01:19:21,060 --> 01:19:26,810
<i>Yeah, wonderful to me.</i>
