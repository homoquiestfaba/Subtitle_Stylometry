1
00:02:27,545 --> 00:02:30,481
<i>You go out in the field,
and you look up in the sky,</i>

2
00:02:30,482 --> 00:02:31,882
<i>and you see the stars,</i>

3
00:02:31,883 --> 00:02:33,650
<i>and some of that light</i>

4
00:02:33,651 --> 00:02:36,221
<i>that's coming down to your eye</i>

5
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:39,223
<i>has been traveling
for millions of years.</i>

6
00:02:39,224 --> 00:02:41,258
<i>So you look up, and you're
looking at the past,</i>

7
00:02:41,259 --> 00:02:43,494
<i>and then you look down,</i>

8
00:02:43,495 --> 00:02:46,496
<i>and you're looking at the past.</i>

9
00:02:46,497 --> 00:02:47,737
<i>You know, those dinosaur bones</i>

10
00:02:47,738 --> 00:02:50,234
<i>are, like,
millions of years old,</i>

11
00:02:50,235 --> 00:02:51,636
and that light left there

12
00:02:51,637 --> 00:02:53,404
maybe at the same time
that you're looking...

13
00:02:53,405 --> 00:02:55,506
it's just you're kind of
sandwiched in that world,

14
00:02:55,507 --> 00:02:57,475
and it's really...
really a wonderful place

15
00:02:57,476 --> 00:02:58,687
being out in the field.

16
00:03:09,488 --> 00:03:11,656
<i>It was a brilliant story,</i>

17
00:03:11,657 --> 00:03:13,858
<i>I mean, if you
didn't have to live it</i>

18
00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:15,032
<i>like the Larsons did.</i>

19
00:03:21,032 --> 00:03:22,567
<i>It's a good American tale.</i>

20
00:03:22,568 --> 00:03:24,936
Unfortunately,
it had a bad ending

21
00:03:24,937 --> 00:03:29,818
for a couple real
brilliant paleontologists.

22
00:04:13,818 --> 00:04:16,488
<i>What does that
white line mean, Susan?</i>

23
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:26,597
<i>We'd been digging</i>

24
00:04:26,598 --> 00:04:28,836
<i>at the Ruth Mason Quarry
since 1979.</i>

25
00:04:30,836 --> 00:04:33,037
<i>The 1990 season,</i>

26
00:04:33,038 --> 00:04:35,345
<i>I think we were
into the third month.</i>

27
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:40,945
<i>We'd been working north...</i>

28
00:04:40,946 --> 00:04:42,986
<i>actually not working at
the quarry itself anymore.</i>

29
00:04:43,014 --> 00:04:44,482
<i>We were actually prospecting</i>

30
00:04:44,483 --> 00:04:45,950
<i>and looking for fossils.</i>

31
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,552
<i>We were looking for fossils</i>

32
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:49,354
<i>on Sharky Williams'</i>

33
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:51,955
<i>and his brother
Maurice Williams' ranch</i>

34
00:04:51,956 --> 00:04:53,825
and finding
some pretty cool stuff,

35
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:55,960
and we get up on August 12,

36
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:58,362
<i>look outside the tent,
and it's foggy.</i>

37
00:04:58,363 --> 00:05:01,064
<i>It's kind of a weird thing
to have fog on the prairie.</i>

38
00:05:01,065 --> 00:05:03,534
So we got kind of
a little bit later start.

39
00:05:03,535 --> 00:05:04,736
We weren't in any big hurry,

40
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:06,104
because you couldn't see
very well,

41
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:09,474
and then went out to start
loading up the Suburban.

42
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,975
We have a 1975 Suburban
all rusted out.

43
00:05:11,976 --> 00:05:14,712
And I look,

44
00:05:14,713 --> 00:05:16,114
and the tire's flat.

45
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:17,814
So I say, "Oh, crap."
Well, almost flat.

46
00:05:17,815 --> 00:05:19,684
Still had a little bit
of air in it.

47
00:05:19,685 --> 00:05:23,688
So I go in the back
to get the spare tire,

48
00:05:23,689 --> 00:05:26,056
and the spare tire's flat,

49
00:05:26,057 --> 00:05:28,592
so I pull out the tire pump,

50
00:05:28,593 --> 00:05:31,061
and the tire pump hose
is broken.

51
00:05:31,062 --> 00:05:33,463
So we figure,
"I guess we better...

52
00:05:33,464 --> 00:05:35,499
we better head in to town
while we still have

53
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,940
enough air in the tire
to get there."

54
00:05:37,002 --> 00:05:38,669
<i>We decided, well,</i>

55
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,104
<i>we're gonna have to go to town.</i>

56
00:05:40,105 --> 00:05:41,873
<i>I'd been out there
for four of five weeks.</i>

57
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:42,994
<i>Going to town, that's okay.</i>

58
00:05:43,007 --> 00:05:44,876
I can take it easy
for half an hour,

59
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:46,477
an hour.
That's fine with me,

60
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:47,945
but of course, Susan,

61
00:05:47,946 --> 00:05:50,148
Susan just can't handle that.

62
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:52,417
You know, that's a waste
of time, right?

63
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:53,818
<i>There was the flat tire.</i>

64
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:55,552
<i>I was like, "Great.</i>

65
00:05:55,553 --> 00:05:57,487
<i>You guys go to town
and don't need me.</i>

66
00:05:57,488 --> 00:05:59,523
<i>I've got this place
I want to look at."</i>

67
00:05:59,524 --> 00:06:01,092
<i>Out there, you need landmarks</i>

68
00:06:01,093 --> 00:06:03,561
<i>to find your way around,
and I said,</i>

69
00:06:03,562 --> 00:06:05,563
<i>"Okay, it's foggy.
You can't see.</i>

70
00:06:05,564 --> 00:06:07,631
<i>Make sure you don't walk
in a circle."</i>

71
00:06:07,632 --> 00:06:10,112
<i>And, like, two hours later, I
was right back where I started,</i>

72
00:06:10,113 --> 00:06:12,470
and I could not believe it.

73
00:06:12,471 --> 00:06:14,311
I just couldn't believe it,
'cause I was, like,

74
00:06:14,312 --> 00:06:15,907
trying so hard to walk straight.

75
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:18,144
It was like...
I felt really stupid.

76
00:06:20,144 --> 00:06:21,578
<i>Believe it was the next day</i>

77
00:06:21,579 --> 00:06:23,147
<i>we went back
with the video camera</i>

78
00:06:23,148 --> 00:06:26,519
<i>and just kind of reenacted,
you know, how I found her.</i>

79
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:30,588
<i>Anybody who had any idea</i>

80
00:06:30,589 --> 00:06:32,857
<i>what a fossil versus a rock was</i>

81
00:06:32,858 --> 00:06:34,592
<i>would have seen it,
'cause there was</i>

82
00:06:34,593 --> 00:06:37,061
<i>a lot of broken bones
dribbling down.</i>

83
00:06:37,062 --> 00:06:39,463
<i>About eight foot
up the side of the cliff,</i>

84
00:06:39,464 --> 00:06:41,566
<i>there were
three articulated vertebrae</i>

85
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,701
<i>and a couple other pieces
of bones sticking out.</i>

86
00:06:43,702 --> 00:06:46,703
<i>From the debris pile,
I picked up scraps</i>

87
00:06:46,704 --> 00:06:49,506
<i>that showed the hollowness
and took it with,</i>

88
00:06:49,507 --> 00:06:51,576
<i>'cause I knew if I went back</i>

89
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:54,244
to where they were working,
they wouldn't believe me.

90
00:06:54,245 --> 00:06:56,147
We got back after
fixing the tire,

91
00:06:56,148 --> 00:06:57,748
and we were at the dig site.

92
00:06:57,749 --> 00:06:59,549
We were just finishing
up doing stuff,

93
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:01,219
and Susan comes up.

94
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,520
And she opens her hand,

95
00:07:03,521 --> 00:07:07,525
and she's got two pretty
small pieces of bone,

96
00:07:07,526 --> 00:07:09,760
only about this big,
in her hand.

97
00:07:09,761 --> 00:07:11,828
And I'd never seen the inside

98
00:07:11,829 --> 00:07:13,498
of a T. rex vertebra
before,

99
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:16,032
but I knew exactly that was
what she had in her hand,

100
00:07:16,033 --> 00:07:18,068
and I says,
"Is there more of it?"

101
00:07:18,069 --> 00:07:19,636
She said,
"There's a lot more."

102
00:07:19,637 --> 00:07:22,040
So we ran, literally ran
back to the site.

103
00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:34,150
<i>Crawl up on the cliff face,</i>

104
00:07:34,151 --> 00:07:35,820
<i>and I see three
articulated vertebrae,</i>

105
00:07:35,821 --> 00:07:37,655
<i>and from that point on,</i>

106
00:07:37,656 --> 00:07:40,157
<i>I'm absolutely certain
this is going to be</i>

107
00:07:40,158 --> 00:07:41,626
the best thing we ever found

108
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,294
and it's going to be
a complete T. rex.

109
00:07:43,295 --> 00:07:44,996
<i>He called up and said,</i>

110
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:46,864
<i>"Neal, I need you to bring</i>

111
00:07:46,865 --> 00:07:48,566
<i>a lot of plaster two-by-fours."</i>

112
00:07:48,567 --> 00:07:51,068
<i>Well, it took me a day
to get everything ready,</i>

113
00:07:51,069 --> 00:07:53,804
<i>and I came up, and I got up
there with all these materials,</i>

114
00:07:53,805 --> 00:07:56,540
<i>and he took me
over to this big cliff,</i>

115
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,042
<i>and he said, "Take a look."</i>

116
00:07:58,043 --> 00:08:00,076
<i>And I looked at it,
and I looked at him.</i>

117
00:08:00,077 --> 00:08:01,578
I said, "Is that T. rex?"

118
00:08:01,579 --> 00:08:03,080
He said, "Yes,

119
00:08:03,081 --> 00:08:05,187
and I think it's all here."

120
00:08:10,187 --> 00:08:12,056
And we haven't started digging

121
00:08:12,057 --> 00:08:13,823
or haven't moved
anything around yet.

122
00:08:13,824 --> 00:08:15,944
We've just been looking at
it and taking some pictures

123
00:08:15,945 --> 00:08:17,862
and trying to figure out
how to proceed.

124
00:08:17,863 --> 00:08:19,564
There's a real mass
of bones here.

125
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:21,232
Some are caught up
in concretion,

126
00:08:21,233 --> 00:08:24,234
but most appear to be really
excellently preserved.

127
00:08:24,235 --> 00:08:27,237
And I believe that the
tail's going that way

128
00:08:27,238 --> 00:08:30,141
and the skull is going this way,

129
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:32,710
but we're just going to
have to dig it up and see.

130
00:08:32,711 --> 00:08:33,978
<i>Collecting fossils</i>

131
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:35,979
<i>is something that's very timely.</i>

132
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:38,181
<i>Fossils are discovered because
they're weathering out,</i>

133
00:08:38,182 --> 00:08:41,118
<i>because the forces of nature,</i>

134
00:08:41,119 --> 00:08:45,122
<i>rain, winds, freezing,
thawing, even snowfall,</i>

135
00:08:45,123 --> 00:08:47,124
<i>have an effect on that fossil.</i>

136
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:48,792
Every day that it's outside

137
00:08:48,793 --> 00:08:50,846
is a day that it's
going to destruction.

138
00:08:54,032 --> 00:08:55,296
<i>We started by picking up</i>

139
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,268
<i>all these thousands
of fragments of bones</i>

140
00:08:58,269 --> 00:09:00,006
<i>and bagging them, labeling them.</i>

141
00:09:02,006 --> 00:09:03,673
<i>Well, the plan of attack</i>

142
00:09:03,674 --> 00:09:05,875
<i>is to protect the
specimen first of all,</i>

143
00:09:05,876 --> 00:09:08,879
and then you go above the
specimen and dig down to it

144
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,181
so that you can get
all the way around it

145
00:09:11,182 --> 00:09:12,656
<i>to remove it from the cliff.</i>

146
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,992
<i>We basically used</i>

147
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:23,360
<i>these ditch-digging tools,
picks and shovels,</i>

148
00:09:23,361 --> 00:09:26,364
<i>to dig down that 30 feet
from where I thought</i>

149
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:29,066
<i>we could get back
into the cliff face</i>

150
00:09:29,067 --> 00:09:31,335
far enough to uncover
what I thought

151
00:09:31,336 --> 00:09:33,231
would be the limits
of that skeleton.

152
00:09:37,075 --> 00:09:38,676
<i>Probably the hardest work</i>

153
00:09:38,677 --> 00:09:40,177
<i>I've ever had to do in my life.</i>

154
00:09:40,178 --> 00:09:41,778
<i>We were doing this all</i>

155
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:45,221
in temperatures around
115 degrees every day.

156
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:50,821
<i>It was very hard work,</i>

157
00:09:50,822 --> 00:09:52,322
<i>but it was very easy</i>

158
00:09:52,323 --> 00:09:55,225
<i>to put in a lot
of energy into it,</i>

159
00:09:55,226 --> 00:09:56,927
<i>because we all wanted to see</i>

160
00:09:56,928 --> 00:09:59,034
<i>what the skeleton
was going to look like.</i>

161
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:02,667
<i>Basically, we'd take
different sections</i>

162
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:04,701
<i>so we weren't
in each other's way</i>

163
00:10:04,702 --> 00:10:06,269
<i>and just kind of worked
the specimen</i>

164
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,442
<i>until we could start
removing bones.</i>

165
00:10:11,442 --> 00:10:12,976
<i>You know, and every time</i>

166
00:10:12,977 --> 00:10:14,417
<i>somebody found a bone
or fragments,</i>

167
00:10:14,418 --> 00:10:16,080
<i>they just said,
"the S bone."</i>

168
00:10:16,081 --> 00:10:18,766
<i>We wouldn't say, "Skull."
We didn't want to jinx it.</i>

169
00:10:20,217 --> 00:10:21,217
<i>Pretty early on,</i>

170
00:10:21,894 --> 00:10:23,421
<i>I hit something hard, and so,</i>

171
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:25,226
I stopped.

172
00:10:28,226 --> 00:10:30,360
<i>"It's the 'S' word," I said,</i>

173
00:10:30,361 --> 00:10:32,105
thinking,
"I bet I hit the skull."

174
00:10:40,105 --> 00:10:41,316
<i>When I got down digging</i>

175
00:10:41,998 --> 00:10:44,841
<i>and then started really working
with the smaller knife,</i>

176
00:10:44,842 --> 00:10:46,409
<i>we found, as we were going down,</i>

177
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,248
<i>is the back of the skull.</i>

178
00:10:50,248 --> 00:10:51,849
<i>And we're getting down,</i>

179
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:53,984
<i>and here's this skull
taking shape,</i>

180
00:10:53,985 --> 00:10:55,385
<i>and we get out on the side,</i>

181
00:10:55,386 --> 00:10:56,921
<i>and I put Terry to work</i>

182
00:10:56,922 --> 00:10:58,388
<i>on cleaning
the side of the skull,</i>

183
00:10:58,389 --> 00:11:01,392
<i>'cause he's really
our best preparator.</i>

184
00:11:01,393 --> 00:11:02,993
<i>Pete let me work</i>

185
00:11:02,994 --> 00:11:04,729
<i>on part of the skull
in the field,</i>

186
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,799
<i>which was amazing.</i>

187
00:11:08,779 --> 00:11:10,201
<i>He's working and uncovering</i>

188
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:13,874
<i>the teeth one by one by one.</i>

189
00:11:15,874 --> 00:11:18,042
<i>It was spectacular.</i>

190
00:11:18,043 --> 00:11:19,043
<i>Teeth like this</i>

191
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:22,513
just sticking
right out of the skull.

192
00:11:22,514 --> 00:11:24,815
We're going, "Oh, my God.
Look at this thing.

193
00:11:25,015 --> 00:11:26,883
Look how huge it is.
This has gotta be

194
00:11:26,884 --> 00:11:28,644
<i>bigger than the one
at the American Museum.</i>

195
00:11:28,645 --> 00:11:30,524
<i>It's huge.
It's wonderful."</i>

196
00:11:41,298 --> 00:11:43,167
<i>We had started a long time ago</i>

197
00:11:43,168 --> 00:11:44,802
<i>naming particular dinosaurs,</i>

198
00:11:44,803 --> 00:11:46,202
<i>and the name Sue,</i>

199
00:11:46,203 --> 00:11:48,839
for Susan Hendrickson,
goes down in history,

200
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,907
and I think that's
a kind of a cool way

201
00:11:50,908 --> 00:11:52,877
<i>to reward those amateurs</i>

202
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,452
<i>who make these discoveries.</i>

203
00:12:01,452 --> 00:12:02,787
<i>We were all</i>

204
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:04,187
<i>experienced diggers.</i>

205
00:12:04,188 --> 00:12:05,948
<i>You know, it was just
total focused effort.</i>

206
00:12:05,949 --> 00:12:09,058
<i>We would just
work into the specimen,</i>

207
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:11,427
<i>remove things that we could,</i>

208
00:12:11,428 --> 00:12:12,863
<i>protect the rest of it,</i>

209
00:12:12,864 --> 00:12:14,264
<i>and then take it
out of the ground</i>

210
00:12:14,265 --> 00:12:15,932
<i>and get it back
into the laboratory,</i>

211
00:12:15,933 --> 00:12:17,893
<i>where you can have a more
controlled environment</i>

212
00:12:17,894 --> 00:12:20,104
<i>to take care of the specimen.</i>

213
00:12:20,105 --> 00:12:21,305
<i>The amount of new things</i>

214
00:12:21,306 --> 00:12:22,907
<i>that we found and the amount</i>

215
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,708
<i>of scientific information
that we discovered</i>

216
00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:26,911
<i>while finding Sue was enormous.</i>

217
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,547
<i>Beautifully preserved
articulated skull,</i>

218
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:31,849
<i>articulated vertebral column</i>

219
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,249
<i>up to the pelvis with the tail</i>

220
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,884
<i>and shoulder blade
and all this stuff,</i>

221
00:12:34,885 --> 00:12:36,353
<i>and it's just like,
"Holy cow."</i>

222
00:12:36,354 --> 00:12:39,355
<i>And wonderful preservation.
Just fantastic bones</i>

223
00:12:39,356 --> 00:12:42,599
<i>that were just
beautiful surface on them.</i>

224
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:49,200
<i>Every time we were ready</i>

225
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:50,901
<i>to take a bone out or every time</i>

226
00:12:50,902 --> 00:12:52,369
<i>there was some new discovery,</i>

227
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:53,970
<i>Pete would take
this butcher paper out,</i>

228
00:12:53,971 --> 00:12:56,072
<i>and he mapped each
and every bone one on one</i>

229
00:12:56,073 --> 00:12:57,810
<i>that we found,
that was excavated.</i>

230
00:13:27,038 --> 00:13:29,038
<i>Pete and I had
quite a few discussions</i>

231
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:30,441
<i>what would be fair.</i>

232
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:32,042
<i>$5,000 is the most that anybody</i>

233
00:13:32,043 --> 00:13:33,563
<i>had ever given anyone
for a dinosaur,</i>

234
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:36,146
<i>for any fossil in the ground,</i>

235
00:13:36,147 --> 00:13:37,648
<i>so Pete wrote
a check out for him</i>

236
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:39,649
<i>and a contract that he
wanted Maurice to sign.</i>

237
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:41,585
And I showed it to him,
and he said,

238
00:13:41,586 --> 00:13:43,986
"Well, we don't need to sign anything.
It's just something...

239
00:13:43,987 --> 00:13:45,455
a handshake between friends,

240
00:13:45,456 --> 00:13:47,224
<i>and $5,000 is fine.
I'm happy with that."</i>

241
00:13:47,225 --> 00:13:48,558
<i>And, you know, that was the most</i>

242
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:50,293
<i>that any landowner
had ever gotten.</i>

243
00:13:50,294 --> 00:13:52,463
<i>We shook hands, and he
was pretty excited</i>

244
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:54,359
<i>about seeing it
set up in the museum.</i>

245
00:14:04,909 --> 00:14:07,912
<i>Last phase of getting Sue
out of the ground,</i>

246
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:11,916
<i>we used basically
Egyptian techniques</i>

247
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:14,451
<i>to get this large block.
I mean, we had...</i>

248
00:14:14,452 --> 00:14:16,320
<i>one of the blocks weighed</i>

249
00:14:16,321 --> 00:14:18,922
<i>probably something
close to 10,000 pounds.</i>

250
00:14:18,923 --> 00:14:21,258
<i>There was probably about
10 ton of material total</i>

251
00:14:21,259 --> 00:14:22,470
<i>that we had to load up.</i>

252
00:14:31,202 --> 00:14:32,603
<i>Once we had the skull</i>

253
00:14:32,604 --> 00:14:34,437
<i>and pelvic block
and the tail vertebrae</i>

254
00:14:34,438 --> 00:14:36,440
<i>and everything else,
we knew we could haul</i>

255
00:14:36,441 --> 00:14:38,308
<i>a lot of the stuff
on our Bobcat trailer.</i>

256
00:14:38,309 --> 00:14:40,444
<i>We had no idea how
we were going to be able</i>

257
00:14:40,445 --> 00:14:41,685
<i>to get all these other things.</i>

258
00:14:41,686 --> 00:14:43,180
<i>Well, my brother John had built</i>

259
00:14:43,181 --> 00:14:45,983
<i>a tandem-axle trailer
earlier that year.</i>

260
00:14:45,984 --> 00:14:47,183
<i>With that and the other</i>

261
00:14:47,184 --> 00:14:48,585
<i>pickup truck that we had there,</i>

262
00:14:48,586 --> 00:14:51,357
<i>we were able
to load the fossil up.</i>

263
00:14:53,357 --> 00:14:56,359
<i>After we had built pallets
underneath the fossil,</i>

264
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,696
<i>we were able to scooch
some plywood underneath 'em</i>

265
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:01,230
<i>so that we could move it
with chains and come-alongs</i>

266
00:15:01,231 --> 00:15:03,472
<i>and get it into the trailers.</i>

267
00:15:08,472 --> 00:15:11,175
It was and still is today

268
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:12,609
the most exciting,

269
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:16,513
the most wonderful excavation
we have ever done,

270
00:15:16,514 --> 00:15:19,424
<i>the most incredible thing
we have ever done.</i>

271
00:16:04,428 --> 00:16:06,129
<i>Dinosaurs, for me, are still</i>

272
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:07,730
<i>one of the most amazing</i>

273
00:16:07,731 --> 00:16:10,133
<i>creatures ever to have
lived on the planet.</i>

274
00:16:10,134 --> 00:16:13,670
<i>You're touching something
that was alive</i>

275
00:16:13,671 --> 00:16:16,672
<i>65, 100, or three or more
hundred million years ago.</i>

276
00:16:16,673 --> 00:16:19,308
When you pick up a fossil,

277
00:16:19,309 --> 00:16:23,312
and you're
the first ever human being

278
00:16:23,313 --> 00:16:27,084
to touch the remains
of that organism,

279
00:16:27,085 --> 00:16:29,420
it's a remarkable feeling.

280
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:31,354
<i>Dinosaurs are iconic animals.</i>

281
00:16:31,355 --> 00:16:33,123
<i>They represent
paleontology in general.</i>

282
00:16:33,124 --> 00:16:34,490
<i>They represent science.</i>

283
00:16:34,491 --> 00:16:36,493
Dinosaurs lived
for 150 million years,

284
00:16:36,494 --> 00:16:38,796
and they dominated
the world for that long,

285
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:41,498
and yet humans have only been
around for three, four, or five.

286
00:16:41,499 --> 00:16:43,367
What are our chances?

287
00:16:43,368 --> 00:16:46,202
We seem to be approaching
these big problems.

288
00:16:46,203 --> 00:16:48,739
<i>Most of what is to be learned
about the history of life</i>

289
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:51,374
<i>is yet to be discovered.</i>

290
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:53,455
<i>What's still out there?
What's still in the ground?</i>

291
00:16:53,456 --> 00:16:56,613
What some kids might find
100 years from now

292
00:16:56,614 --> 00:16:58,849
will contribute to that
greater understanding.

293
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:01,718
<i>We know nothing about
the history of the planet</i>

294
00:17:01,719 --> 00:17:04,488
<i>unless learning it through
a paleontologist,</i>

295
00:17:04,489 --> 00:17:07,490
and it's that sense of
deep time, real deep time,

296
00:17:07,491 --> 00:17:09,593
that gives you
a sense of who you are

297
00:17:09,594 --> 00:17:11,805
and how you fit in
to the scheme of things.

298
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,834
<i>I first fell in love</i>

299
00:17:50,835 --> 00:17:53,437
<i>with fossils when I was
about four years old.</i>

300
00:17:53,438 --> 00:17:56,306
<i>I picked up this small tooth</i>

301
00:17:56,307 --> 00:17:59,843
<i>down on my folks' ranch.</i>

302
00:17:59,844 --> 00:18:02,246
<i>From then on,
I just was so fascinated</i>

303
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,547
with fossils.
I just couldn't stop.

304
00:18:04,548 --> 00:18:06,583
Every day that
the weather was good

305
00:18:06,584 --> 00:18:08,285
and every day that
the weather was great

306
00:18:08,286 --> 00:18:10,487
that was on a weekend
if we were going to school

307
00:18:10,488 --> 00:18:12,189
or in the summertime,
Dad would always say,

308
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,612
"Let's go out
rock hunting."

309
00:18:23,215 --> 00:18:25,268
<i>We ended up starting
this little museum,</i>

310
00:18:25,269 --> 00:18:28,704
<i>and we'd charge the adults
in our family five cents.</i>

311
00:18:28,705 --> 00:18:30,707
<i>We had little displays</i>

312
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:32,742
<i>where we set up the things
that we had collected,</i>

313
00:18:32,743 --> 00:18:34,778
<i>and not just fossils and rocks,</i>

314
00:18:34,779 --> 00:18:38,582
<i>but also what we thought
were antiques.</i>

315
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:40,918
We had this horrible hobby

316
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:43,890
that started to captivate
every part of our life.

317
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:47,490
<i>Eventually I decided</i>

318
00:18:47,491 --> 00:18:49,226
<i>to really get into paleontology</i>

319
00:18:49,227 --> 00:18:50,826
<i>and so went
to the South Dakota School</i>

320
00:18:50,827 --> 00:18:52,775
<i>of Mines and Technology
in Rapid City.</i>

321
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:58,268
<i>Junior year, we went</i>

322
00:18:58,269 --> 00:18:59,937
<i>to the Tucson
Gem and Mineral Show</i>

323
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:02,538
<i>and really saw how
specimens are purchased</i>

324
00:19:02,539 --> 00:19:04,961
<i>by museums and purchased
by private collectors.</i>

325
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:09,379
<i>And by the time we graduated,</i>

326
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,646
<i>we started this business</i>

327
00:19:10,647 --> 00:19:12,249
<i>called Black Hills Minerals</i>

328
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,040
<i>as this earth science
supply house.</i>

329
00:19:18,288 --> 00:19:20,289
<i>Eventually
my younger brother Neal,</i>

330
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:22,392
<i>who was also a student
at the School of Mines,</i>

331
00:19:22,393 --> 00:19:24,228
<i>and Bob Farrar,
one of his classmates,</i>

332
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:25,962
<i>started working with us as well.</i>

333
00:19:25,963 --> 00:19:27,431
<i>With the three of us</i>

334
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:28,798
<i>all going
to the School of Mines,</i>

335
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,800
<i>we were problems there,</i>

336
00:19:30,801 --> 00:19:33,502
<i>because all of us chose</i>

337
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:35,271
<i>not to go into industry.</i>

338
00:19:35,272 --> 00:19:37,774
<i>The first year was terrible,</i>

339
00:19:37,775 --> 00:19:39,942
<i>the second year was not so good,</i>

340
00:19:39,943 --> 00:19:42,154
<i>but it was sort of
turning into a business.</i>

341
00:19:44,015 --> 00:19:45,548
<i>As we kept going,</i>

342
00:19:45,549 --> 00:19:47,483
<i>we kept collecting
more and more fossils</i>

343
00:19:47,484 --> 00:19:50,487
<i>and had the idea
of it probably would work</i>

344
00:19:50,488 --> 00:19:53,289
<i>to sell these
as display specimens.</i>

345
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:55,291
<i>In 1978,</i>

346
00:19:55,292 --> 00:19:57,693
<i>we were going pretty strong.</i>

347
00:19:57,694 --> 00:20:00,297
<i>We were selling mostly fossils.</i>

348
00:20:00,298 --> 00:20:02,633
<i>We were going out and doing
geological exploration.</i>

349
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:05,501
<i>So by 1979,</i>

350
00:20:05,502 --> 00:20:07,703
<i>we created this new entity</i>

351
00:20:07,704 --> 00:20:10,874
<i>called Black Hills Institute of
Geological Research, Incorporated,</i>

352
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:13,453
<i>in the center
of the Black Hills.</i>

353
00:20:37,734 --> 00:20:39,635
<i>We got Sue back to Hill City.</i>

354
00:20:39,636 --> 00:20:42,639
<i>We moved the big blocks
into the warehouse,</i>

355
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,473
<i>actually built a room</i>

356
00:20:44,474 --> 00:20:46,942
<i>around where we had put Sue,</i>

357
00:20:46,943 --> 00:20:49,782
<i>started working
on this wonderful fossil.</i>

358
00:20:51,782 --> 00:20:53,717
<i>When I was prepping Sue,</i>

359
00:20:53,718 --> 00:20:55,618
<i>I was cloistered like a monk</i>

360
00:20:55,619 --> 00:20:57,320
<i>in the back corner
of the back building.</i>

361
00:20:57,321 --> 00:20:58,521
<i>Doing preparation, you just...</i>

362
00:20:58,522 --> 00:20:59,756
<i>"Just leave me alone," right?</i>

363
00:20:59,757 --> 00:21:01,357
<i>But everybody was in there.</i>

364
00:21:01,358 --> 00:21:02,798
<i>There would be
schoolkids in there.</i>

365
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:05,095
<i>Or another day, there'd be,</i>

366
00:21:05,096 --> 00:21:06,697
<i>you know, some scientist guys</i>

367
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:08,531
<i>coming along in there.</i>

368
00:21:08,532 --> 00:21:10,052
<i>I mean, Pete had,
like, 30 scientists</i>

369
00:21:10,053 --> 00:21:11,401
<i>working on a major new monograph</i>

370
00:21:11,402 --> 00:21:12,903
<i>on Tyrannosaurus rex,</i>

371
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:15,706
<i>so you got to suck it up.
Pete wants it this way.</i>

372
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:18,909
<i>He wants this specimen
available to everybody.</i>

373
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,643
It was so beautiful.

374
00:21:20,644 --> 00:21:22,612
Just the preservation
was incredible.

375
00:21:22,613 --> 00:21:24,681
It was just, "Wow."

376
00:21:24,682 --> 00:21:26,415
Everybody knew about Sue.

377
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:27,983
We hadn't made
any secret of the fact

378
00:21:27,984 --> 00:21:29,618
that we'd collected her.

379
00:21:29,619 --> 00:21:30,953
<i>We had 2,000 visitors</i>

380
00:21:30,954 --> 00:21:32,521
<i>sign this little guest book</i>

381
00:21:32,522 --> 00:21:34,391
<i>that went way in the back
in our warehouse</i>

382
00:21:34,392 --> 00:21:36,393
<i>to see the skull of Sue.</i>

383
00:21:36,394 --> 00:21:39,395
<i>I was just totally flabbergasted
when I saw the specimen.</i>

384
00:21:39,396 --> 00:21:41,565
First of all, the size
is just so imposing.

385
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:43,566
<i>But what I was more amazed by</i>

386
00:21:43,567 --> 00:21:46,470
<i>was what a great job they were
doing preparing the specimen.</i>

387
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,404
<i>I'd heard inklings
that the Black Hills</i>

388
00:21:48,405 --> 00:21:50,941
<i>Institute boys had
found something.</i>

389
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:52,642
One of the first things

390
00:21:52,643 --> 00:21:53,977
I saw was actually,

391
00:21:53,978 --> 00:21:56,747
you know, part
of the skull of Sue

392
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:58,981
<i>still encased in matrix.</i>

393
00:21:58,982 --> 00:22:00,951
<i>65 million years later,</i>

394
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:03,953
<i>this animal really had the
power to give you goose bumps.</i>

395
00:22:03,954 --> 00:22:06,757
To see the look on
Pete's face and Neal's,

396
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:08,959
those guys were just like proud papas.
They would inform you.

397
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,960
They would go do classes
at school for the kids,

398
00:22:10,961 --> 00:22:12,828
so it was very educational
for all of us,

399
00:22:12,829 --> 00:22:14,408
and I learned a lot from that.

400
00:22:22,006 --> 00:22:23,640
<i>Ever since we created</i>

401
00:22:23,641 --> 00:22:25,541
<i>that little museum
on our parents' ranch,</i>

402
00:22:25,542 --> 00:22:26,942
<i>it's always been our dream</i>

403
00:22:26,943 --> 00:22:28,733
<i>to have a museum here
in Hill City.</i>

404
00:22:30,147 --> 00:22:33,150
<i>And finding Sue
the Tyrannosaurus rex,</i>

405
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:34,836
<i>here's the anchor
for the museum.</i>

406
00:22:37,348 --> 00:22:38,822
<i>The whole town is behind us.</i>

407
00:22:39,022 --> 00:22:40,891
<i>It's going to put Hill City
on the map</i>

408
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:43,366
<i>in a way that it's never
been on the map before.</i>

409
00:22:45,529 --> 00:22:49,098
Didn't matter how many other
projects we had going on.

410
00:22:49,099 --> 00:22:50,678
With Sue, Sue took precedence.

411
00:22:54,605 --> 00:22:55,763
<i>We found out all kinds</i>

412
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:57,874
<i>of cool things
about this dinosaur.</i>

413
00:22:57,875 --> 00:22:59,755
<i>Broken and healed bones
all over the skeleton.</i>

414
00:22:59,756 --> 00:23:01,444
<i>This animal had a terrible life,</i>

415
00:23:01,445 --> 00:23:03,648
<i>a terrible, rough life.</i>

416
00:23:04,648 --> 00:23:07,483
<i>The skull of Sue
had actually had...</i>

417
00:23:07,484 --> 00:23:09,219
the left side of the lower jaw

418
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,621
had been literally ripped
out of the socket,

419
00:23:11,622 --> 00:23:13,623
still held together
here at the symphysis,

420
00:23:13,624 --> 00:23:15,124
<i>where the two ends
of the lower jaw</i>

421
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:16,759
<i>come together in the front,</i>

422
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,627
<i>but it's been torn loose
from the socket</i>

423
00:23:18,628 --> 00:23:20,228
<i>which allows the jaw
to open and close.</i>

424
00:23:20,229 --> 00:23:21,765
<i>And the postorbital,</i>

425
00:23:21,766 --> 00:23:23,165
the bone
directly behind the eye,

426
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:25,067
was broken and pulled outwards

427
00:23:25,068 --> 00:23:27,570
and laying
at sort of a weird angle,

428
00:23:27,571 --> 00:23:29,206
<i>so I think
that she actually died</i>

429
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:31,523
<i>from the attack of
another Tyrannosaurus rex.</i>

430
00:23:38,048 --> 00:23:39,649
<i>That was a big job.</i>

431
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:42,652
<i>I mean, it took me a year,
literally a year</i>

432
00:23:42,653 --> 00:23:45,654
<i>just to, you know,
remove individual bones</i>

433
00:23:45,655 --> 00:23:47,156
<i>from around the skull
and then...</i>

434
00:23:47,157 --> 00:23:50,093
and then to take that,
the giant hip bones,

435
00:23:50,094 --> 00:23:51,166
<i>off of the nose.</i>

436
00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:57,767
<i>We finally were able</i>

437
00:23:57,768 --> 00:23:59,935
<i>to lift the pelvis
off of Sue's skull</i>

438
00:23:59,936 --> 00:24:02,204
<i>in the beginning of May, 1992.</i>

439
00:24:02,205 --> 00:24:03,539
<i>Okay. Let's go.</i>

440
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,713
- Up?
- Let's go.

441
00:24:09,713 --> 00:24:11,780
<i>Taking that hip</i>

442
00:24:11,781 --> 00:24:14,550
<i>off of Sue's skull was critical</i>

443
00:24:14,551 --> 00:24:15,951
<i>to doing it right,</i>

444
00:24:15,952 --> 00:24:17,952
<i>because you don't have
a second chance.</i>

445
00:24:18,497 --> 00:24:19,655
<i>You okay there, Terry?</i>

446
00:24:19,656 --> 00:24:21,223
- Oh!
- Okay.

447
00:24:21,224 --> 00:24:24,059
<i>If you think
of two big ships, you know,</i>

448
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:26,595
<i>when you get those kind
of weights going on,</i>

449
00:24:26,596 --> 00:24:28,516
<i>one little movement,
you don't what's going on.</i>

450
00:24:28,517 --> 00:24:30,700
It could be cracking it
all the way through inside.

451
00:24:30,701 --> 00:24:32,235
-<i> Okay, go.</i>
- Go.

452
00:24:32,236 --> 00:24:34,571
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

453
00:24:39,076 --> 00:24:41,177
Yeah. That must be
where the weight is.

454
00:24:41,178 --> 00:24:42,178
<i>- Yep.
- Yep.</i>

455
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:43,246
Okay, it's looking good.

456
00:24:43,247 --> 00:24:45,114
We're at three here.

457
00:24:45,115 --> 00:24:47,249
We're at three here.

458
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:48,852
What am I down to?

459
00:24:48,853 --> 00:24:51,121
Hey, we're loose in
the front finally!

460
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:52,722
- All right.
-<i> Yeah!</i>

461
00:24:58,729 --> 00:24:59,930
<i>That moment,</i>

462
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:01,964
<i>when we made that separation,</i>

463
00:25:01,965 --> 00:25:04,867
that was probably

464
00:25:04,868 --> 00:25:07,237
the highest point of my life.

465
00:25:07,238 --> 00:25:09,573
<i>- How was that?
- Champagne.</i>

466
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:11,607
<i>Hide it.</i>

467
00:25:11,608 --> 00:25:13,876
<i>"Hide it."</i>

468
00:25:13,877 --> 00:25:15,711
<i>There has to be a toast.
Who toasts?</i>

469
00:25:15,712 --> 00:25:17,113
<i>This whole...
I don't know.</i>

470
00:25:17,114 --> 00:25:19,214
<i>- Cheers.
- Just, "Cheers."</i>

471
00:25:19,215 --> 00:25:20,951
<i>- You ready?
- Ready.</i>

472
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:22,318
<i>- Sue.
- To old Sue.</i>

473
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:24,120
- Sue.
- Sue.

474
00:25:24,121 --> 00:25:26,756
<i>- Sue.
- Yeah.</i>

475
00:25:26,757 --> 00:25:28,625
<i>Yeah.</i>

476
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,261
<i>It's very good champagne.</i>

477
00:25:32,262 --> 00:25:33,997
<i>Look at this.</i>

478
00:25:33,998 --> 00:25:35,165
<i>I know.</i>

479
00:25:39,636 --> 00:25:42,838
<i>We were riding
on top of the world.</i>

480
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:46,877
<i>We had everything going for us.</i>

481
00:25:47,877 --> 00:25:50,865
Less than a week after that,
all hell broke loose.

482
00:26:07,865 --> 00:26:10,033
<i>Bob and I were downstairs.</i>

483
00:26:10,034 --> 00:26:11,634
<i>We were both in the prep lab.</i>

484
00:26:11,635 --> 00:26:13,068
<i>We had a buzzer on our door</i>

485
00:26:13,069 --> 00:26:14,738
<i>so that if anybody came in,</i>

486
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,772
<i>it would buzz
back in the prep lab,</i>

487
00:26:16,773 --> 00:26:18,908
<i>and we could go meet them
in the front office.</i>

488
00:26:18,909 --> 00:26:20,309
<i>It was about 7:00
in the morning</i>

489
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,912
<i>when the buzzer went off.</i>

490
00:26:29,693 --> 00:26:31,220
<i>We were met by two FBI agents</i>

491
00:26:31,221 --> 00:26:33,722
<i>with a search warrant
to take Sue</i>

492
00:26:33,723 --> 00:26:35,258
<i>and all records
belonging to Sue.</i>

493
00:26:35,259 --> 00:26:36,692
<i>They showed up</i>

494
00:26:36,693 --> 00:26:38,961
<i>expecting
to seal off the building</i>

495
00:26:38,962 --> 00:26:40,262
<i>and keep anybody from going in.</i>

496
00:26:40,263 --> 00:26:41,964
"Just wait here.
We have to get Pete."

497
00:26:41,965 --> 00:26:44,800
They sent me to get Pete,
and I was running.

498
00:26:44,801 --> 00:26:46,761
<i>I lived in a trailer house
behind the Institute.</i>

499
00:26:46,762 --> 00:26:48,104
<i>"The FBI's here.</i>

500
00:26:48,105 --> 00:26:49,972
They're all over
the place."

501
00:26:49,973 --> 00:26:52,809
They've got yellow police tape
around the main building.

502
00:26:53,009 --> 00:26:54,844
<i>"Do not cross.</i>

503
00:26:54,845 --> 00:26:55,965
<i>Police line.
Do not cross."</i>

504
00:26:56,012 --> 00:26:57,346
<i>It was hard to know</i>

505
00:26:57,347 --> 00:26:58,987
<i>what was really happening
at that point.</i>

506
00:26:58,988 --> 00:27:00,416
<i>I go down to the office,</i>

507
00:27:00,417 --> 00:27:02,251
<i>and there's two FBI
agents sitting there.</i>

508
00:27:02,252 --> 00:27:03,952
<i>"You've stolen this
from federal land,</i>

509
00:27:03,953 --> 00:27:06,855
<i>and we're coming
here to seize this."</i>

510
00:27:06,856 --> 00:27:08,758
<i>I got a phone call
from Peter Larson,</i>

511
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:10,326
<i>because it wasn't just the FBI.</i>

512
00:27:10,327 --> 00:27:12,362
It was personnel
from South Dakota Tech.

513
00:27:12,363 --> 00:27:14,897
It was personnel from
other federal agencies,

514
00:27:14,898 --> 00:27:16,769
and it was the National Guard.

515
00:27:18,369 --> 00:27:20,689
<i>The U.S. Attorney at the
time, Kevin Schieffer,</i>

516
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:21,805
got reporters together

517
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:24,874
<i>in the Federal Building
in Rapid City</i>

518
00:27:24,875 --> 00:27:26,942
<i>and announced that the
seizure was ongoing.</i>

519
00:27:26,943 --> 00:27:29,211
The purpose of our action
this morning

520
00:27:29,212 --> 00:27:33,216
is to preserve...

521
00:27:33,217 --> 00:27:35,151
the scientific knowledge

522
00:27:35,152 --> 00:27:37,287
and integrity of these fossils.

523
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:39,055
Then of course
the entire press corps

524
00:27:39,056 --> 00:27:40,789
hopped in their cars,

525
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:42,429
<i>and we drove to Hill City.</i>

526
00:27:45,429 --> 00:27:46,796
<i>They were supposed</i>

527
00:27:46,797 --> 00:27:48,498
<i>to take things related to Sue,</i>

528
00:27:48,499 --> 00:27:49,800
<i>but they took everything.</i>

529
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,934
<i>They went through
all of our offices,</i>

530
00:27:51,935 --> 00:27:54,304
<i>all of our desks,
all of our mail trays,</i>

531
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:55,904
<i>taking mail opened, unopened.</i>

532
00:27:55,905 --> 00:27:57,339
<i>Somebody called me</i>

533
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,209
<i>and said, "The FBI's
got crime scene tape</i>

534
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:01,010
<i>around the Institute,
and they're taking Sue."</i>

535
00:28:01,011 --> 00:28:02,345
<i>I hung up the phone, and I went</i>

536
00:28:02,346 --> 00:28:04,346
<i>as fast as I could
down to the Institute.</i>

537
00:28:04,347 --> 00:28:06,048
<i>I don't know
how many agents they had,</i>

538
00:28:06,049 --> 00:28:07,889
<i>30-some people or whatever.
It was just insane.</i>

539
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:09,052
<i>I didn't even think about it.</i>

540
00:28:09,053 --> 00:28:10,754
<i>I grabbed the tape
and go under it.</i>

541
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:12,055
<i>I just went to the specimen.</i>

542
00:28:12,056 --> 00:28:13,422
<i>That was my concern.</i>

543
00:28:13,423 --> 00:28:14,825
<i>I could just see these idiots,</i>

544
00:28:15,025 --> 00:28:17,427
you know, just try
to pack up my dinosaur

545
00:28:17,428 --> 00:28:19,295
and take it away and ruin it.

546
00:28:19,296 --> 00:28:20,896
How dare they?

547
00:28:20,897 --> 00:28:23,232
How dare these people do this?

548
00:28:23,233 --> 00:28:24,968
Unconscionable.
I can't imagine

549
00:28:24,969 --> 00:28:26,469
somebody being able to do this

550
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:29,365
here in the United States of
America, in a free country.

551
00:28:32,041 --> 00:28:33,942
<i>In order to ensure
that this dinosaur</i>

552
00:28:33,943 --> 00:28:35,944
could be carefully packed up,

553
00:28:35,945 --> 00:28:37,814
we helped.

554
00:28:37,815 --> 00:28:39,449
It was pretty clear

555
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:41,183
that they didn't know
what they were doing.

556
00:28:41,184 --> 00:28:42,552
<i>These people
didn't know anything.</i>

557
00:28:42,553 --> 00:28:44,787
<i>I mean, most of these guys</i>

558
00:28:44,788 --> 00:28:46,489
<i>hardly go out
in the field at all.</i>

559
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:48,223
<i>What do they know
about preparing a fossil</i>

560
00:28:48,224 --> 00:28:49,826
<i>or packing it or anything?</i>

561
00:28:49,827 --> 00:28:51,193
The Larsons were trying to do

562
00:28:51,194 --> 00:28:52,314
a little bit of negotiating.

563
00:28:52,315 --> 00:28:54,497
"Put Sue under lock and key

564
00:28:54,498 --> 00:28:56,833
at our place
to prevent damage."

565
00:28:56,834 --> 00:28:58,233
I said to Kevin Schieffer,

566
00:28:58,234 --> 00:28:59,935
"You just tell me,

567
00:28:59,936 --> 00:29:01,570
and that fossil
won't go anywhere.

568
00:29:01,571 --> 00:29:03,806
It's not like it's going to
disappear in a briefcase."

569
00:29:03,807 --> 00:29:06,543
That request was denied.

570
00:29:06,544 --> 00:29:08,478
It is clearly a violation

571
00:29:08,479 --> 00:29:10,145
under the Antiquities Act

572
00:29:10,146 --> 00:29:13,149
to remove antiquities

573
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:15,852
from United States lands

574
00:29:15,853 --> 00:29:17,573
without the permission
of the United States.

575
00:29:17,574 --> 00:29:18,988
The federal government doesn't

576
00:29:18,989 --> 00:29:21,124
show up with the National Guard

577
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:22,991
and an Assistant...
or pardon me...

578
00:29:22,992 --> 00:29:25,864
an Acting United States
Attorney in pancake makeup...

579
00:29:26,864 --> 00:29:29,431
...with the intention
of working things out

580
00:29:29,432 --> 00:29:31,144
somewhere down the road.

581
00:29:40,144 --> 00:29:42,511
<i>After we got over</i>

582
00:29:42,512 --> 00:29:44,346
<i>the initial shock, those of us</i>

583
00:29:44,347 --> 00:29:46,048
<i>who were packing the dinosaur</i>

584
00:29:46,049 --> 00:29:49,419
<i>kind of went
into our packing mode,</i>

585
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,287
<i>but towards the end of the day,</i>

586
00:29:51,288 --> 00:29:52,822
<i>it became obvious that something</i>

587
00:29:53,022 --> 00:29:54,423
<i>was going on with the town.</i>

588
00:29:54,424 --> 00:29:56,291
<i>People around town noticed.</i>

589
00:29:56,292 --> 00:29:58,060
<i>They noticed all the cop cars.</i>

590
00:29:58,061 --> 00:29:59,629
<i>They noticed the police tape.</i>

591
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:00,963
<i>All of a sudden,</i>

592
00:30:00,964 --> 00:30:02,231
<i>there were people with signs</i>

593
00:30:02,232 --> 00:30:03,432
<i>out in front of our building</i>

594
00:30:03,433 --> 00:30:05,101
<i>It was clear that people</i>

595
00:30:05,102 --> 00:30:06,903
<i>were not happy
with what was going on.</i>

596
00:30:06,904 --> 00:30:09,037
The protest developed
very quickly,

597
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:11,406
<i>so there were a lot of
people on the street.</i>

598
00:30:11,407 --> 00:30:13,047
<i>I was working
for "National Geographic,"</i>

599
00:30:13,048 --> 00:30:14,477
and we were gonna take

600
00:30:14,478 --> 00:30:16,078
the skull of Sue and put it

601
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:17,764
into a CAT scan of what they use

602
00:30:17,964 --> 00:30:21,049
for the space shuttles to see if we
could see inside the skull of Sue.

603
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:24,586
And Terry Wentz answered the phone, and
he said, "Well, I don't think so,"

604
00:30:24,587 --> 00:30:26,456
<i>so I got
on the next plane I could,</i>

605
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:29,959
<i>and the place was
surrounded by cops.</i>

606
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,640
<i>I mean, you thought
that there was, like,</i>

607
00:30:31,641 --> 00:30:33,512
<i>a real T. rex loose
on the property.</i>

608
00:30:35,332 --> 00:30:36,932
<i>The next day in,</i>

609
00:30:36,933 --> 00:30:38,201
<i>they brought reinforcements,</i>

610
00:30:38,202 --> 00:30:40,068
<i>a lot more people.</i>

611
00:30:40,069 --> 00:30:42,471
<i>The idea was that we were
going to load this stuff up</i>

612
00:30:42,472 --> 00:30:45,307
and haul it somewhere.

613
00:30:45,308 --> 00:30:49,045
And when the Director
of Military Support,

614
00:30:49,046 --> 00:30:50,646
one of the Colonels
got down there,

615
00:30:50,647 --> 00:30:52,515
he called and said,
"Hey, General,

616
00:30:52,516 --> 00:30:54,116
this is not what we expected.

617
00:30:54,117 --> 00:30:55,518
This is a media event.

618
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:57,953
We got schoolkids out here.

619
00:30:57,954 --> 00:31:00,957
We got parents out here.
What should we do?"

620
00:31:00,958 --> 00:31:03,092
And I said,
"Well, just go do it."

621
00:31:03,093 --> 00:31:04,493
...cruel! Save Sue!

622
00:31:04,494 --> 00:31:06,562
Don't be cruel! Save Sue!

623
00:31:06,563 --> 00:31:08,498
Don't be cruel! Save Sue!

624
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:10,633
Don't be cruel! Save Sue!

625
00:31:10,634 --> 00:31:12,501
Don't be cruel! Save Sue!

626
00:31:12,502 --> 00:31:15,070
Don't be cruel! Save Sue!

627
00:31:15,071 --> 00:31:17,105
Save Sue! Save Sue!

628
00:31:17,106 --> 00:31:19,208
Save Sue! Save Sue!

629
00:31:19,209 --> 00:31:21,177
Save Sue! Save Sue!

630
00:31:21,178 --> 00:31:23,211
All day long,

631
00:31:23,212 --> 00:31:25,248
the protestors kept arriving.

632
00:31:25,249 --> 00:31:27,249
Protesting about what
the government was doing.

633
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:29,352
Save Sue! Save Sue!

634
00:31:29,353 --> 00:31:32,287
Save Sue! Save Sue!
Save Sue!

635
00:31:32,288 --> 00:31:34,123
<i>Shame on you!</i>

636
00:31:34,124 --> 00:31:35,525
<i>Shame on you!</i>

637
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:37,527
<i>Shame on you!</i>

638
00:31:37,528 --> 00:31:39,194
<i>Shame on you!</i>

639
00:31:39,195 --> 00:31:40,997
<i>Shame on you!</i>

640
00:31:40,998 --> 00:31:42,000
<i>Shame on you!</i>

641
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,499
<i>Shame on you!</i>

642
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,134
<i>Shame on you!</i>

643
00:31:46,135 --> 00:31:47,670
Shame on you!

644
00:31:47,671 --> 00:31:49,271
Shame on you!

645
00:31:49,272 --> 00:31:50,672
Shame on you!

646
00:31:50,673 --> 00:31:52,408
Shame on you!

647
00:31:52,409 --> 00:31:54,177
Shame on you!

648
00:31:54,178 --> 00:31:55,577
Shame on you!

649
00:31:55,578 --> 00:31:57,180
Shame on you!

650
00:31:57,181 --> 00:31:59,516
Shame on you! Shame on you!

651
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:02,250
<i>Kids protesting,</i>

652
00:32:02,251 --> 00:32:03,685
<i>adults protesting.</i>

653
00:32:03,686 --> 00:32:06,288
<i>It was not the sort
of public relations event</i>

654
00:32:06,289 --> 00:32:09,291
<i>that, you know,
law enforcement likes,</i>

655
00:32:09,292 --> 00:32:11,594
<i>because they're
taking away this T. rex</i>

656
00:32:11,595 --> 00:32:14,069
from a very small town
that really could use it.

657
00:32:20,336 --> 00:32:22,037
<i>On the third day,</i>

658
00:32:22,038 --> 00:32:24,009
<i>the National Guard
had brought up</i>

659
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:27,576
<i>large equipment, including
forklifts and things,</i>

660
00:32:27,577 --> 00:32:30,345
<i>and the crowd
had grown by this time.</i>

661
00:32:30,346 --> 00:32:32,147
Leave our Sue!

662
00:32:32,148 --> 00:32:33,615
Leave our Sue!

663
00:32:33,616 --> 00:32:35,084
Leave our Sue!

664
00:32:35,085 --> 00:32:37,153
<i>People were
so emotionally involved.</i>

665
00:32:37,154 --> 00:32:38,720
<i>The amazing thing to me</i>

666
00:32:38,721 --> 00:32:41,156
<i>was it wasn't just us.</i>

667
00:32:41,157 --> 00:32:42,557
<i>The whole town,</i>

668
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:45,495
<i>entire town of Hill City</i>

669
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:47,095
was in mourning

670
00:32:47,096 --> 00:32:49,066
when they took
that dinosaur away.

671
00:32:55,338 --> 00:32:57,774
<i>Here was a dream
that the town had.</i>

672
00:32:57,775 --> 00:33:00,343
It was our dinosaur.

673
00:33:00,344 --> 00:33:02,612
It was our museum.

674
00:33:02,613 --> 00:33:04,479
<i>It was our lives</i>

675
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,217
<i>that had been just
torn to pieces.</i>

676
00:33:08,218 --> 00:33:11,220
<i>I was in France,
and they called me,</i>

677
00:33:11,221 --> 00:33:13,722
<i>and, you know, I
thought it was a joke.</i>

678
00:33:13,723 --> 00:33:16,096
Couldn't believe it,
and I cried.

679
00:33:20,096 --> 00:33:21,497
<i>I was highly emotional,</i>

680
00:33:21,498 --> 00:33:23,833
but from that moment
that I heard

681
00:33:23,834 --> 00:33:25,535
that the specimen
was going to be taken,

682
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:27,569
my focus was on the specimen.

683
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:30,206
Legally and all that other crap,

684
00:33:30,207 --> 00:33:31,673
that's not my concern.

685
00:33:31,674 --> 00:33:34,110
My concern was
make sure that dinosaur

686
00:33:34,111 --> 00:33:36,645
was going to transport,
everything was going to be safe.

687
00:33:36,646 --> 00:33:39,114
Sue belonged here,

688
00:33:39,115 --> 00:33:41,500
and what happened was not right.

689
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,367
<i>You know, it was like a funeral,</i>

690
00:33:59,368 --> 00:34:01,636
<i>losing a family member.</i>

691
00:34:01,637 --> 00:34:03,239
<i>It just felt like a nightmare,</i>

692
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:07,375
like it just wasn't
really happening, just...

693
00:34:07,376 --> 00:34:08,778
The place was a mess.

694
00:34:08,779 --> 00:34:11,379
We, all of a sudden,
were a mess.

695
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:13,664
And they hauled Sue away.

696
00:34:27,664 --> 00:34:30,202
<i>I don't know how Peter did it.</i>

697
00:34:33,202 --> 00:34:36,671
One of the hardest
things to watch

698
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:38,841
and be a part of

699
00:34:38,842 --> 00:34:41,843
was knowing that literally

700
00:34:41,844 --> 00:34:44,599
Peter was in love
with that dinosaur.

701
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:05,234
♪ And the home ♪

702
00:35:05,235 --> 00:35:09,574
♪ Of the brave. ♪

703
00:36:11,467 --> 00:36:13,602
<i>I grew up in Hill City,</i>

704
00:36:13,603 --> 00:36:15,805
<i>and I lived in Los Angeles</i>

705
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:17,906
<i>at the time Sue was discovered.</i>

706
00:36:17,907 --> 00:36:20,910
In 1992, I was working
at "Unsolved Mysteries,"

707
00:36:20,911 --> 00:36:22,511
a TV show on NBC,

708
00:36:22,512 --> 00:36:24,613
researching cases where people

709
00:36:24,614 --> 00:36:26,915
convicted of crimes
insist they were innocent.

710
00:36:26,916 --> 00:36:29,618
And that first day
the dinosaur was seized,

711
00:36:29,619 --> 00:36:31,821
Pete called me on the phone
in the middle of it all.

712
00:36:32,021 --> 00:36:34,689
He said the FBI was here,

713
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:38,560
and it was dramatic and scary,

714
00:36:38,561 --> 00:36:41,964
and he needed coverage.
He needed support.

715
00:36:41,965 --> 00:36:44,734
So I thought, well,
I'll go cover the story

716
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:46,768
and take a hiatus

717
00:36:46,769 --> 00:36:49,504
and maybe move away
from L.A. forever.

718
00:36:49,505 --> 00:36:51,473
I didn't know,
but I just packed up

719
00:36:51,474 --> 00:36:52,808
and bailed back to South Dakota

720
00:36:52,809 --> 00:36:55,343
by the end of the year
to cover the story and see

721
00:36:55,344 --> 00:36:56,818
what was gonna happen to it.

722
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:01,817
America's Indian tribes
have fought the white man

723
00:37:01,818 --> 00:37:03,821
over many different
issues through the years,

724
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:06,429
but the newest fight
is over a dinosaur.

725
00:37:12,429 --> 00:37:13,529
<i>It was a big story</i>

726
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:14,696
<i>and a very unusual story.</i>

727
00:37:14,697 --> 00:37:17,066
To have the federal
government come in

728
00:37:17,067 --> 00:37:18,701
and seize Sue,

729
00:37:18,702 --> 00:37:20,803
- everything exploded.
- Controversy tonight.

730
00:37:20,804 --> 00:37:22,437
Controversy surrounding
the Institute

731
00:37:22,438 --> 00:37:23,839
and their most famous discovery.

732
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,308
It may be the custody
battle of the century...

733
00:37:26,309 --> 00:37:27,977
scientists, Indians,
the U.S. government.

734
00:37:27,978 --> 00:37:29,611
You find any fossils,

735
00:37:29,612 --> 00:37:31,413
the government
may take them away.

736
00:37:31,414 --> 00:37:33,316
Not only has he taken
this dinosaur away,

737
00:37:33,317 --> 00:37:34,984
but he's taken our
research away too,

738
00:37:34,985 --> 00:37:37,852
every photograph, every record
we had about this dinosaur

739
00:37:37,853 --> 00:37:39,421
and the locality
where she was found.

740
00:37:39,422 --> 00:37:41,624
Sue was seized pursuant
to a search warrant,

741
00:37:41,625 --> 00:37:43,859
but there was never
a crime charged.

742
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:46,995
Pat and I talked
about filing suit.

743
00:37:46,996 --> 00:37:48,730
You know, we sued the
federal government

744
00:37:48,731 --> 00:37:50,153
for return of our property.

745
00:37:52,101 --> 00:37:53,768
<i>The Black Hills Institute</i>

746
00:37:53,769 --> 00:37:56,738
said it purchased the fossil
from Maurice Williams.

747
00:37:56,739 --> 00:37:59,607
Originally Maurice
Williams said that too,

748
00:37:59,608 --> 00:38:01,776
but then he changed his claim,

749
00:38:01,777 --> 00:38:03,946
and he said he had
not sold the fossil

750
00:38:03,947 --> 00:38:05,915
and that he owned it.

751
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:07,018
Mr. Williams...

752
00:38:08,018 --> 00:38:09,752
<i>Pete and Neal had</i>

753
00:38:09,753 --> 00:38:12,620
<i>made a deal with Maurice
Williams for $5,000.</i>

754
00:38:12,621 --> 00:38:14,556
<i>On that Saturday,</i>

755
00:38:14,557 --> 00:38:16,877
<i>the day before we finished
getting Sue out of the ground,</i>

756
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:19,761
<i>that we gave Maurice
Williams a check for $5,000,</i>

757
00:38:19,762 --> 00:38:21,596
<i>that said for "Theropod Sue"</i>

758
00:38:21,597 --> 00:38:22,997
<i>on the bottom of the check.</i>

759
00:38:22,998 --> 00:38:24,866
<i>Even though $5,000 may
not seem like a lot,</i>

760
00:38:24,867 --> 00:38:27,535
it was a lot of money for
our company to spend,

761
00:38:27,536 --> 00:38:30,071
<i>and no one had ever
paid that much</i>

762
00:38:30,072 --> 00:38:32,640
<i>for an undiscovered
fossil before.</i>

763
00:38:32,641 --> 00:38:35,044
<i>We had lots of conversations
with Maurice Williams</i>

764
00:38:35,045 --> 00:38:37,379
<i>about what was happening
to the dinosaur.</i>

765
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:39,620
<i>He knew that we were going to
bring it back to Hill City.</i>

766
00:38:39,621 --> 00:38:41,082
<i>He was completely
in favor of that.</i>

767
00:38:41,083 --> 00:38:42,917
<i>He knew about the museum
we were building.</i>

768
00:38:42,918 --> 00:38:44,986
<i>He knew we were going to
be preparing the fossil.</i>

769
00:38:44,987 --> 00:38:47,040
<i>That's about the only
ones that we have.</i>

770
00:38:53,356 --> 00:38:54,830
<i>Well, it's not the only one.</i>

771
00:38:54,831 --> 00:38:56,131
<i>- Almost.
- Almost.</i>

772
00:38:56,132 --> 00:38:57,972
<i>And it's not...
not completely...</i>

773
00:39:11,648 --> 00:39:13,948
<i>Maurice Williams never intended</i>

774
00:39:13,949 --> 00:39:16,951
<i>to sell that fossil.</i>

775
00:39:16,952 --> 00:39:19,955
Maurice Williams knew
exactly what he was doing.

776
00:39:19,956 --> 00:39:21,924
Numerous people
said, "Had we known

777
00:39:21,925 --> 00:39:23,959
you were on his ranch, we
would have warned you."

778
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,560
<i>I had known people</i>

779
00:39:25,561 --> 00:39:26,962
<i>who knew Maurice and Sharky,</i>

780
00:39:26,963 --> 00:39:28,564
<i>and they were colorful</i>

781
00:39:28,565 --> 00:39:29,631
<i>and controversial figures</i>

782
00:39:29,632 --> 00:39:30,732
<i>in their own right</i>

783
00:39:30,733 --> 00:39:32,577
on the Cheyenne River
Reservation.

784
00:39:41,577 --> 00:39:44,046
There began to emerge
some controversy

785
00:39:44,047 --> 00:39:47,683
about Sue being
collected from Indian land

786
00:39:47,684 --> 00:39:48,948
and the ownership issue.

787
00:40:09,572 --> 00:40:12,241
<i>You could not have
discovered this rex</i>

788
00:40:12,242 --> 00:40:16,611
in a worse and potentially

789
00:40:16,612 --> 00:40:18,186
legally complicated place.

790
00:40:23,186 --> 00:40:24,787
<i>It was discovered</i>

791
00:40:24,788 --> 00:40:26,187
<i>within the exterior boundaries</i>

792
00:40:26,188 --> 00:40:28,089
<i>of the Cheyenne River
Sioux tribe</i>

793
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:32,627
<i>on land which was held in trust</i>

794
00:40:32,628 --> 00:40:35,196
<i>for the benefit of Maurice
Williams, the landowner.</i>

795
00:40:35,197 --> 00:40:36,799
<i>Wasn't tribal land.</i>

796
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,134
It wasn't federal land.

797
00:40:39,135 --> 00:40:41,504
It was a really...

798
00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:42,904
Sue came out

799
00:40:42,905 --> 00:40:46,614
from an absolute
legal netherworld.

800
00:40:50,392 --> 00:40:51,814
<i>Indian people were given...</i>

801
00:40:52,014 --> 00:40:54,950
<i>heads of household
were given 160 acres</i>

802
00:40:54,951 --> 00:40:58,821
<i>in what we call
the Allotment Acts.</i>

803
00:40:58,822 --> 00:41:00,288
And that was to try

804
00:41:00,289 --> 00:41:02,524
and make people
who didn't understand

805
00:41:02,525 --> 00:41:04,627
land ownership
be owners of land,

806
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:06,028
but they really
didn't own the land.

807
00:41:06,029 --> 00:41:08,230
So there became this concept

808
00:41:08,231 --> 00:41:10,098
of trust responsibility,

809
00:41:10,099 --> 00:41:13,935
and nothing ostensibly is
supposed to happen to that land

810
00:41:13,936 --> 00:41:15,770
without the approval
of the federal government

811
00:41:15,771 --> 00:41:17,876
through the Bureau
of Indian Affairs.

812
00:41:20,876 --> 00:41:22,578
<i>On the reservations,</i>

813
00:41:22,579 --> 00:41:24,299
<i>the United States holds
that land in trust</i>

814
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:27,249
<i>for the individual Indian
as the beneficiary.</i>

815
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:30,252
And the United States

816
00:41:30,253 --> 00:41:32,687
has a fiduciary responsibility

817
00:41:32,688 --> 00:41:35,790
to individual Indians
and/or their families.

818
00:41:35,791 --> 00:41:38,318
that they get the highest
and best use out of it.

819
00:41:41,597 --> 00:41:43,064
<i>All across the West,</i>

820
00:41:43,065 --> 00:41:46,968
<i>it is a patchwork quilt
of laws and regulations</i>

821
00:41:46,969 --> 00:41:49,971
<i>concerning what can
and can't be harvested</i>

822
00:41:49,972 --> 00:41:51,277
<i>that's paleontological.</i>

823
00:41:54,277 --> 00:41:57,245
<i>You can be all right in
this quarter section,</i>

824
00:41:57,246 --> 00:41:58,980
but if you get off
a little bit...

825
00:41:58,981 --> 00:42:00,982
remember this is before GPS.

826
00:42:00,983 --> 00:42:03,151
If you get off a little
bit to the wrong place,

827
00:42:03,152 --> 00:42:05,754
you might be dealing with a whole
'nother set of regulations.

828
00:42:05,755 --> 00:42:08,756
The tribe claimed that
because Maurice Williams,

829
00:42:08,757 --> 00:42:11,225
being a member of the tribe,

830
00:42:11,226 --> 00:42:13,127
had not purchased

831
00:42:13,128 --> 00:42:16,098
a $100 permit to sell something,

832
00:42:16,099 --> 00:42:17,966
the fossil should be forfeited

833
00:42:17,967 --> 00:42:20,069
and therefore
they owned the fossil.

834
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:21,669
And of course
the government said

835
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:23,071
that it was government property

836
00:42:23,072 --> 00:42:26,150
and that that was because
of the trust land issue.

837
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:36,352
The seizure and the subpoena

838
00:42:36,353 --> 00:42:38,386
were the brainchild

839
00:42:38,387 --> 00:42:40,888
of Acting U.S. Attorney
Kevin Schieffer.

840
00:42:40,889 --> 00:42:42,290
<i>He was a controversial</i>

841
00:42:42,291 --> 00:42:44,292
<i>figure as
a U.S. Attorney,</i>

842
00:42:44,293 --> 00:42:48,296
<i>because he hadn't had lot of
experience practicing law.</i>

843
00:42:48,297 --> 00:42:50,666
He had the ability to
drive some people crazy.

844
00:42:50,866 --> 00:42:53,134
I do have a fair amount
of litigation experience.

845
00:42:53,135 --> 00:42:56,138
I have not had
courtroom experience.

846
00:42:56,139 --> 00:42:57,245
<i>It's a little unclear</i>

847
00:42:58,007 --> 00:43:02,410
as to why Schieffer
decided to seize Sue

848
00:43:02,411 --> 00:43:04,346
or decided to become
interested in this at all,

849
00:43:04,347 --> 00:43:06,214
<i>whether it began
with Maurice Williams</i>

850
00:43:06,215 --> 00:43:08,183
<i>or a complaint from the tribe.</i>

851
00:43:08,184 --> 00:43:11,654
<i>Ultimately the decision was
Kevin Schieffer's, though,</i>

852
00:43:11,655 --> 00:43:15,996
<i>to decide that this was something
that they wanted to do.</i>

853
00:43:20,596 --> 00:43:22,916
<i>Also was shocking from a
scientific standpoint,</i>

854
00:43:22,917 --> 00:43:24,785
<i>that anybody would
behave so recklessly</i>

855
00:43:24,786 --> 00:43:27,435
with the greatest paleontological
find of all time.

856
00:43:27,436 --> 00:43:29,203
If that dinosaur seizure

857
00:43:29,204 --> 00:43:30,805
wasn't a publicity stunt,

858
00:43:30,806 --> 00:43:32,306
then I don't know what is.

859
00:43:32,307 --> 00:43:34,676
There could have been
a gang in this town

860
00:43:34,677 --> 00:43:36,678
with a warehouse
holding a ton of cocaine

861
00:43:36,679 --> 00:43:38,747
and human bodies
hanging from the rafters,

862
00:43:38,748 --> 00:43:40,548
and the federal government
would not have sent

863
00:43:40,549 --> 00:43:43,251
35 agents
and the National Guard.

864
00:43:51,827 --> 00:43:54,163
<i>Just a few of 'em.
Bumper stickers?</i>

865
00:43:54,164 --> 00:43:55,863
<i>There's some in every vehicle.</i>

866
00:43:55,864 --> 00:43:58,767
We would just like to gain
public support for our cause

867
00:43:58,768 --> 00:44:00,736
of getting Sue
back to Hill City.

868
00:44:00,737 --> 00:44:03,337
<i>When you get the big foot
of the government come in</i>

869
00:44:03,338 --> 00:44:05,941
<i>and do something like that,
you better answer</i>

870
00:44:05,942 --> 00:44:07,382
<i>in a way that people
can understand</i>

871
00:44:07,383 --> 00:44:08,944
<i>that this is wrong.</i>

872
00:44:08,945 --> 00:44:11,379
You know, they just protested
for three straight days

873
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:14,116
in front of the Institute
during the raid.

874
00:44:14,117 --> 00:44:15,718
They weren't done.

875
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:17,252
"We want to protest."

876
00:44:17,253 --> 00:44:19,822
Okay. Let's go protest.

877
00:44:31,768 --> 00:44:33,938
Stay back.

878
00:44:34,938 --> 00:44:36,337
Everyone stay back.

879
00:44:36,338 --> 00:44:38,406
You'll be thrown to the
ground and arrested.

880
00:44:38,407 --> 00:44:40,241
We got everything
under control here.

881
00:44:40,242 --> 00:44:41,843
We don't want any trouble.

882
00:44:41,844 --> 00:44:43,745
<i>We had people from
all over the community,</i>

883
00:44:43,746 --> 00:44:45,413
all over the Black Hills
trying to help,

884
00:44:45,414 --> 00:44:47,750
<i>and it was amazing,
the support that we had.</i>

885
00:44:47,751 --> 00:44:50,151
We were fighting on every
front we could think of,

886
00:44:50,152 --> 00:44:51,787
everything that you
could think of,

887
00:44:51,788 --> 00:44:53,455
<i>everything from
the Sue Freedom Run</i>

888
00:44:53,456 --> 00:44:55,790
<i>to petitions we took
to the state capitol.</i>

889
00:44:55,791 --> 00:44:58,459
<i>I would talk in front
of groups anywhere.</i>

890
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:00,796
<i>Terry was so involved</i>

891
00:45:00,797 --> 00:45:02,833
<i>in this case.
I mean, he lived it.</i>

892
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:07,301
<i>One of the most moving
things in my life to see,</i>

893
00:45:07,302 --> 00:45:09,171
<i>this wonderful group
of people here</i>

894
00:45:09,172 --> 00:45:10,782
supported us getting Sue back.

895
00:45:19,782 --> 00:45:22,317
The U.S. Attorney,
Mr. Kevin Schieffer,

896
00:45:22,318 --> 00:45:24,453
made a terrible error

897
00:45:24,454 --> 00:45:27,455
in coming that tragic day
on May 14th to Hill City.

898
00:45:27,456 --> 00:45:29,258
The right thing to do
in this case

899
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:31,575
would be to return the
dinosaur to Hill City.

900
00:45:33,396 --> 00:45:35,129
<i>Whoa! Yes, yes!</i>

901
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:36,330
<i>Whoo!</i>

902
00:45:36,331 --> 00:45:38,366
<i>We got now
over 20,000 signatures</i>

903
00:45:38,367 --> 00:45:39,968
<i>on the one petition,</i>

904
00:45:39,969 --> 00:45:42,037
the first petition
to bring Sue back,

905
00:45:42,038 --> 00:45:43,471
and they're from all 50 states

906
00:45:43,472 --> 00:45:45,339
and from 14 other countries.

907
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:47,475
<i>Lot of people didn't have
a lot of money here,</i>

908
00:45:47,476 --> 00:45:49,757
<i>so they wanted to contribute
any way they could do that,</i>

909
00:45:49,758 --> 00:45:51,078
<i>and so there were a lot</i>

910
00:45:51,079 --> 00:45:52,948
<i>of fund-raisers, parades,
buttons, posters,</i>

911
00:45:52,949 --> 00:45:55,216
a show of maybe there's justice,

912
00:45:55,217 --> 00:45:56,350
because, I think, to me,

913
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:58,120
it was just a huge injustice

914
00:45:58,121 --> 00:45:59,988
the fact they could even
do what they've done.

915
00:45:59,989 --> 00:46:02,924
The custody battle
was in full swing,

916
00:46:02,925 --> 00:46:05,928
and it was very dramatic
and scary for people.

917
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:09,964
And as I interviewed Pete
and talked with him,

918
00:46:09,965 --> 00:46:12,755
<i>I realized at that time I'd
never met anybody like him</i>

919
00:46:13,001 --> 00:46:15,005
<i>in his
single-minded pursuit</i>

920
00:46:16,005 --> 00:46:17,872
of what he believed was right,

921
00:46:17,873 --> 00:46:20,875
and also, in the
flurry of emotions,

922
00:46:20,876 --> 00:46:24,879
I thought that meant that he
was the perfect guy for me,

923
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,549
and so despite the fact that
I was writing about him

924
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:29,384
and he should be my subject,

925
00:46:29,385 --> 00:46:31,587
I broke the first rule
of journalism

926
00:46:31,588 --> 00:46:33,955
and fell in love
with my subject.

927
00:46:33,956 --> 00:46:35,991
So we started dating,

928
00:46:35,992 --> 00:46:39,995
<i>and in our
emotional ridiculousness,</i>

929
00:46:39,996 --> 00:46:41,495
<i>got married
really quite quickly,</i>

930
00:46:41,496 --> 00:46:44,098
<i>within months of my moving here.</i>

931
00:46:44,099 --> 00:46:46,301
But it was okay.

932
00:46:46,302 --> 00:46:48,270
It was okay for what
was going on there.

933
00:46:48,271 --> 00:46:51,205
And so we
traversed this together,

934
00:46:51,206 --> 00:46:53,442
and I had...
created for myself

935
00:46:53,443 --> 00:46:55,444
the additional burden of
trying to be a journalist

936
00:46:55,445 --> 00:46:58,159
and separate my personal
feelings from my job.

937
00:47:10,759 --> 00:47:13,199
<i>Two federal courts have
sided with the government,</i>

938
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,830
<i>saying Sue should
stay in the box</i>

939
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:17,531
<i>because there's no proof the
dinosaur is being damaged there.</i>

940
00:47:17,532 --> 00:47:19,267
In another federal court,

941
00:47:19,268 --> 00:47:22,604
they're still arguing over
who actually owns the bones.

942
00:47:22,605 --> 00:47:25,374
The intensity reaction
while the court case

943
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:27,209
was going on
really surprised me.

944
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:30,078
There were people that I thought
were quite reasonable people

945
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:33,348
who basically...

946
00:47:33,349 --> 00:47:36,151
said things about Black Hills
that just were not true.

947
00:47:36,152 --> 00:47:37,518
There is a difference

948
00:47:37,519 --> 00:47:40,988
between the academic perspective

949
00:47:40,989 --> 00:47:42,042
of fossil collecting

950
00:47:43,025 --> 00:47:45,093
and the commercial perspective.

951
00:47:45,094 --> 00:47:47,495
There are some people
in this profession

952
00:47:47,496 --> 00:47:49,363
that really, truly
believe that it is...

953
00:47:49,364 --> 00:47:51,966
there's something morally
wrong with selling a fossil.

954
00:47:51,967 --> 00:47:54,502
I was indoctrinated

955
00:47:54,503 --> 00:47:56,971
as an undergrad

956
00:47:56,972 --> 00:47:58,506
that if you don't have a PhD,

957
00:47:58,507 --> 00:48:00,942
you have no right
to collect dinosaurs.

958
00:48:00,943 --> 00:48:03,946
I heard about the BHI and Peter
Larson collecting fossils,

959
00:48:03,947 --> 00:48:06,515
and I was told,
"These are pirates."

960
00:48:06,516 --> 00:48:08,649
And I visited Pete Larson,

961
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:11,118
and I visited the Black
Hills Institute,

962
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:12,620
and they weren't pirates at all.

963
00:48:12,621 --> 00:48:15,524
They had techniques
they taught my crew.

964
00:48:15,525 --> 00:48:17,259
They were better than my crew.

965
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:19,660
You have academians, and they
have these little fiefdoms,

966
00:48:19,661 --> 00:48:22,997
and now here's these really
great paleontologists

967
00:48:22,998 --> 00:48:24,399
that don't need that system.

968
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,734
Back in the day,
in the early 1900s,

969
00:48:26,735 --> 00:48:28,602
<i>commercial collectors,
quote-unquote,</i>

970
00:48:28,603 --> 00:48:31,372
<i>were filling museums
with specimens</i>

971
00:48:31,373 --> 00:48:34,209
<i>and working hand in hand
with, quote,</i>

972
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:35,743
<i>academic people.</i>

973
00:48:35,744 --> 00:48:37,479
<i>That was an okay relationship.</i>

974
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,547
<i>Around in the '70s
and '80s, that changed.</i>

975
00:48:39,548 --> 00:48:42,551
<i>1980s, we're already seeing</i>

976
00:48:42,552 --> 00:48:46,154
<i>this schism between professional
commercial collectors</i>

977
00:48:46,155 --> 00:48:48,208
<i>versus professional
research collectors.</i>

978
00:48:49,025 --> 00:48:52,028
This race to discover
the Earth's past

979
00:48:53,028 --> 00:48:55,818
is a very exciting one, and
people want a piece of it.

980
00:49:05,307 --> 00:49:07,274
<i>Sue had become</i>

981
00:49:07,275 --> 00:49:09,710
<i>a living entity to me after
all our work in the field</i>

982
00:49:09,711 --> 00:49:12,279
<i>and what were finding out
about her life,</i>

983
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:15,683
<i>and I really missed her
when she was gone.</i>

984
00:49:15,684 --> 00:49:19,287
<i>So one way that I was able to...</i>

985
00:49:19,288 --> 00:49:22,056
sort of help that was
to go and visit her

986
00:49:22,057 --> 00:49:25,060
and to talk with her
through the window,

987
00:49:25,061 --> 00:49:26,428
looking at the container.

988
00:49:26,429 --> 00:49:27,729
So I could see her,

989
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:29,464
see that that container's
still there,

990
00:49:29,465 --> 00:49:31,133
not moved to some other place

991
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:32,734
in Timbuktu or something.

992
00:49:32,735 --> 00:49:35,337
And just kind of had

993
00:49:35,338 --> 00:49:38,610
some little
conversations with her.

994
00:49:56,793 --> 00:49:59,761
<i>It was precious.
It was...</i>

995
00:49:59,762 --> 00:50:01,763
it was sweet.

996
00:50:01,764 --> 00:50:04,765
She was his person,

997
00:50:04,766 --> 00:50:07,234
and later I would realize

998
00:50:07,235 --> 00:50:08,636
she was more of his person

999
00:50:08,637 --> 00:50:11,473
than any other person
has ever been

1000
00:50:11,474 --> 00:50:13,075
and ever will be.

1001
00:50:13,076 --> 00:50:16,645
I got to say that dinosaur
and Pete Larson

1002
00:50:16,646 --> 00:50:18,113
were made for each other.

1003
00:50:18,114 --> 00:50:20,714
And so he had to go talk to her,

1004
00:50:20,715 --> 00:50:22,663
and that was what...
how it should be.

1005
00:50:30,393 --> 00:50:32,393
<i>Mostly I was
trying to reassure her</i>

1006
00:50:32,394 --> 00:50:34,562
<i>that she wasn't going
to rot in that case,</i>

1007
00:50:34,563 --> 00:50:36,598
that was going
to spring her free,

1008
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:38,757
somehow was going
to get her out of there.

1009
00:51:08,597 --> 00:51:11,265
As that whole
custody battle unfolded,

1010
00:51:11,266 --> 00:51:13,368
firstly the tribe

1011
00:51:13,369 --> 00:51:15,669
<i>lost its own case
in tribal court,</i>

1012
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:17,272
<i>which is pretty surprising,</i>

1013
00:51:17,273 --> 00:51:19,774
<i>but evident that it
was a bad claim.</i>

1014
00:51:19,775 --> 00:51:22,209
The government actually
retracted its claim,

1015
00:51:22,210 --> 00:51:24,879
because it realized it
couldn't claim trust property,

1016
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,881
so then it comes down
to two people.

1017
00:51:26,882 --> 00:51:29,817
Is it Maurice's fossil, or is it
Black Hills Institute's fossil?

1018
00:51:29,818 --> 00:51:32,821
Every single filing
the Institute made,

1019
00:51:32,822 --> 00:51:35,422
I really believed would win,

1020
00:51:35,423 --> 00:51:37,392
because it was so clear.

1021
00:51:37,393 --> 00:51:39,194
They had purchased it.

1022
00:51:39,195 --> 00:51:41,863
He had accepted the check.

1023
00:51:41,864 --> 00:51:44,431
He had been on videotape
talking about it.

1024
00:51:44,432 --> 00:51:48,303
It was very clear that he
thought he had sold the fossil

1025
00:51:48,304 --> 00:51:49,746
<i>at the time.</i>

1026
00:51:57,746 --> 00:52:00,515
<i>Judge Battey held</i>

1027
00:52:00,516 --> 00:52:02,551
<i>that a fossil,</i>

1028
00:52:02,552 --> 00:52:05,553
<i>unlike an archeological find,</i>

1029
00:52:05,554 --> 00:52:09,558
had become... the bones
had become mineralized.

1030
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:14,196
Therefore, the fossil was land.

1031
00:52:14,197 --> 00:52:17,631
An individual Indian

1032
00:52:17,632 --> 00:52:19,734
cannot sell land

1033
00:52:19,735 --> 00:52:22,236
that government
holds in trust for him

1034
00:52:22,237 --> 00:52:23,872
without the permission

1035
00:52:23,873 --> 00:52:26,875
of the federal government
to begin with,

1036
00:52:26,876 --> 00:52:28,542
so that's what ended it.

1037
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:29,543
Fossils are land.

1038
00:52:40,222 --> 00:52:43,225
Judge Battey said
actually in his filing

1039
00:52:43,226 --> 00:52:45,326
that the sale was null and void.

1040
00:52:45,327 --> 00:52:46,887
The federal government
took the position

1041
00:52:46,888 --> 00:52:49,296
that he had no authority himself

1042
00:52:49,297 --> 00:52:51,600
to enter into an agreement with
the Black Hills Institute.

1043
00:52:51,601 --> 00:52:53,301
Peter realized

1044
00:52:53,302 --> 00:52:55,904
that he could not have
his fossil back.

1045
00:52:55,905 --> 00:52:57,504
He was devastated.

1046
00:52:57,505 --> 00:53:00,510
The judge decided that
Sue was real estate.

1047
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:05,867
Sue the fossil was real estate.

1048
00:53:24,815 --> 00:53:27,868
I first got involved in the
dinosaur case, as we called it,

1049
00:53:27,869 --> 00:53:31,872
sometime late 1992,

1050
00:53:31,873 --> 00:53:33,642
early 1993.

1051
00:53:33,643 --> 00:53:34,875
Of course they're

1052
00:53:34,876 --> 00:53:36,678
not gonna like what we're doing.

1053
00:53:36,679 --> 00:53:38,546
That's the nature of what we do.

1054
00:53:38,547 --> 00:53:40,681
But hopefully
in a broader spectrum,

1055
00:53:40,682 --> 00:53:43,685
people can look at it and say, "Well,
I'm glad people can't just go out

1056
00:53:43,686 --> 00:53:45,886
into the forest
or go out onto the parks

1057
00:53:45,887 --> 00:53:48,890
and, you know,
take these fossils or..."

1058
00:53:48,891 --> 00:53:50,558
in this particular case...

1059
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:51,959
"or steal stuff off from land.

1060
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,800
and somebody's going
to do something about it."

1061
00:53:53,801 --> 00:53:56,591
Well, we're the somebody that
does something about it.

1062
00:54:03,672 --> 00:54:06,573
<i>After the seizure
of the Sue specimen,</i>

1063
00:54:06,574 --> 00:54:09,810
we continued to look
at this issue

1064
00:54:09,811 --> 00:54:12,846
not from a Park Service
jurisdiction perspective,

1065
00:54:12,847 --> 00:54:15,817
but more from the circumstances

1066
00:54:15,818 --> 00:54:17,451
of business practices

1067
00:54:17,452 --> 00:54:19,829
in terms of collecting
on public lands.

1068
00:54:27,829 --> 00:54:29,930
You really can't do anything

1069
00:54:29,931 --> 00:54:31,933
in any kind of a business
without money.

1070
00:54:31,934 --> 00:54:35,703
<i>What monetary
transactions happened</i>

1071
00:54:35,704 --> 00:54:38,506
<i>during the time that this
enterprise had that fossil,</i>

1072
00:54:38,507 --> 00:54:40,808
<i>and then what did
they do with that fossil?</i>

1073
00:54:40,809 --> 00:54:42,743
<i>Sell it? What happened
to that money?</i>

1074
00:54:42,744 --> 00:54:45,046
<i>And then how we could
assemble the evidence</i>

1075
00:54:45,047 --> 00:54:47,549
<i>around that fossil to see</i>

1076
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:49,417
<i>whether there's something
there that's wrong,</i>

1077
00:54:49,418 --> 00:54:51,840
chargeable, what more
needs to be investigated.

1078
00:54:52,887 --> 00:54:54,955
<i>FBI agents arrived here
in Hill City.</i>

1079
00:54:54,956 --> 00:54:56,658
<i>They presented
the Black Hills Institute</i>

1080
00:54:56,659 --> 00:54:58,179
<i>with a court order.
That order demanded</i>

1081
00:54:58,180 --> 00:54:59,761
the release of more information.

1082
00:54:59,762 --> 00:55:02,002
But the people at the Institute
have another name for it.

1083
00:55:02,003 --> 00:55:03,430
They call it harassment.

1084
00:55:03,431 --> 00:55:04,951
<i>This should not be
allowed to happen.</i>

1085
00:55:04,952 --> 00:55:06,847
This is the United
States of America.

1086
00:55:10,072 --> 00:55:11,772
<i>So far, no criminal charges</i>

1087
00:55:11,773 --> 00:55:13,475
<i>have been filed in the case.</i>

1088
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:15,877
<i>Members of the Institute
say they're innocent</i>

1089
00:55:15,878 --> 00:55:18,747
<i>and are hoping that
a new administration</i>

1090
00:55:18,748 --> 00:55:21,117
<i>will put an end to their
legal fight over Sue.</i>

1091
00:55:27,589 --> 00:55:29,823
<i>Institute officials thought
their problems were over</i>

1092
00:55:29,824 --> 00:55:31,904
<i>when Kevin Schieffer was
replaced as U.S. Attorney,</i>

1093
00:55:31,905 --> 00:55:33,395
but apparently
they continue to be

1094
00:55:33,396 --> 00:55:34,729
the target of
the federal government.

1095
00:55:34,730 --> 00:55:36,064
We have a federal search warrant

1096
00:55:36,065 --> 00:55:37,564
issued by the U.S.
District Court,

1097
00:55:37,565 --> 00:55:39,734
and we're serving
a search warrant.

1098
00:55:39,735 --> 00:55:42,537
<i>Enormous amount of money that
the government's spending</i>

1099
00:55:42,538 --> 00:55:43,772
<i>to put one person out...</i>

1100
00:55:43,773 --> 00:55:45,140
one group of people
out of business

1101
00:55:45,141 --> 00:55:46,808
that's so vital to a community.

1102
00:55:46,809 --> 00:55:48,442
It's been nearly 18 months

1103
00:55:48,443 --> 00:55:50,145
since Sue was seized
from this warehouse,

1104
00:55:50,146 --> 00:55:52,680
and still no charges have been
filed against the Institute.

1105
00:55:52,681 --> 00:55:53,814
Allow us some rights.

1106
00:55:53,815 --> 00:55:55,149
Charge us with something,

1107
00:55:55,150 --> 00:55:57,695
and let's go to court.
Let 12 people decide.

1108
00:56:07,695 --> 00:56:09,596
<i>I couldn't give them
any information</i>

1109
00:56:09,597 --> 00:56:12,966
to help incriminate people
at Black Hills Institute.

1110
00:56:12,967 --> 00:56:15,537
<i>They thought I was
going to be able</i>

1111
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:18,573
to tell them all sorts of terrible
things the Institute did.

1112
00:56:18,574 --> 00:56:19,974
Well, they didn't
do anything wrong.

1113
00:56:19,975 --> 00:56:21,376
They talked to
my attorney about,

1114
00:56:21,377 --> 00:56:24,078
"You better get your guy
in and bring him on in,

1115
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:25,647
or, you know, last chance,

1116
00:56:25,648 --> 00:56:26,816
happening pretty soon,"

1117
00:56:27,016 --> 00:56:28,649
and my attorney says,

1118
00:56:28,650 --> 00:56:30,685
"He just doesn't have
anything to tell you."

1119
00:56:30,686 --> 00:56:32,085
<i>For three years,</i>

1120
00:56:32,086 --> 00:56:34,122
<i>I had no contact
with the Institute.</i>

1121
00:56:34,123 --> 00:56:36,857
<i>That's horrible. I mean, I
considered them best friends,</i>

1122
00:56:36,858 --> 00:56:39,628
and I couldn't call them up.

1123
00:56:40,628 --> 00:56:42,997
<i>Sue was probably the impetus</i>

1124
00:56:42,998 --> 00:56:45,165
for the government following up

1125
00:56:45,166 --> 00:56:47,167
with a criminal prosecution.

1126
00:56:47,168 --> 00:56:49,571
Sue wasn't a part of
what we were looking at

1127
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:51,205
or what was being looked at

1128
00:56:51,206 --> 00:56:53,674
as far as potential
criminal violations.

1129
00:56:53,675 --> 00:56:55,676
<i>There were so many bones,</i>

1130
00:56:55,677 --> 00:56:57,678
<i>so many animals,
so many invertebrates</i>

1131
00:56:57,679 --> 00:57:00,681
<i>that were taken
off from public lands,</i>

1132
00:57:00,682 --> 00:57:03,685
<i>taken internationally,
sold internationally.</i>

1133
00:57:03,686 --> 00:57:05,967
<i>There was way more than we
ever could have investigated.</i>

1134
00:57:05,968 --> 00:57:08,337
The case was never wanting
for not having Sue.

1135
00:57:09,757 --> 00:57:13,928
<i>Because so much material
had been seized,</i>

1136
00:57:13,929 --> 00:57:15,663
<i>I think everybody thought</i>

1137
00:57:15,664 --> 00:57:18,198
that there would be a
massive indictment.

1138
00:57:18,199 --> 00:57:19,933
<i>Tell me a little bit</i>

1139
00:57:19,934 --> 00:57:21,854
<i>about today's indictment.
What alleged activity</i>

1140
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:23,270
<i>are we exactly talking about?</i>

1141
00:57:23,271 --> 00:57:25,573
<i>This indictment charges</i>

1142
00:57:25,574 --> 00:57:28,243
<i>the theft of fossils
off a number</i>

1143
00:57:28,244 --> 00:57:30,278
<i>of different types
of federal land.</i>

1144
00:57:30,279 --> 00:57:32,613
<i>There are also charges in there</i>

1145
00:57:32,614 --> 00:57:34,781
<i>that pertain to
money laundering,</i>

1146
00:57:34,782 --> 00:57:37,518
<i>structuring of
currency transactions,</i>

1147
00:57:37,519 --> 00:57:40,788
<i>false statements made to
various government agencies.</i>

1148
00:57:40,789 --> 00:57:43,524
<i>The indictments were an
avalanche of charges,</i>

1149
00:57:43,525 --> 00:57:46,261
<i>and it was just
a massive document,</i>

1150
00:57:46,262 --> 00:57:48,930
and it looked like a
deathblow to the Institute.

1151
00:57:48,931 --> 00:57:51,633
The government went
just nuts or something,

1152
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:53,667
you know? I mean, they
tried... I guess they just

1153
00:57:53,668 --> 00:57:55,708
threw everything in and hoped
something would stick.

1154
00:57:55,709 --> 00:57:57,272
<i>If you add up the time to serve</i>

1155
00:57:57,273 --> 00:57:59,073
<i>for each of those counts,</i>

1156
00:57:59,074 --> 00:58:00,942
<i>it comes to 353 years
for me, which is</i>

1157
00:58:00,943 --> 00:58:03,044
longer than Jeffrey Dahmer

1158
00:58:03,045 --> 00:58:05,879
as sentenced to prison for,

1159
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:08,082
and he killed and ate,
like, 13 people.

1160
00:58:08,083 --> 00:58:09,817
You know, it doesn't make sense.

1161
00:58:09,818 --> 00:58:12,319
A lot of these accusations

1162
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:14,154
are things that

1163
00:58:14,155 --> 00:58:16,223
we know were legal.

1164
00:58:16,224 --> 00:58:20,060
38 felony indictments
for collecting fossils?

1165
00:58:20,061 --> 00:58:23,096
<i>It totally blew me apart.</i>

1166
00:58:23,097 --> 00:58:25,098
I'm used to fixing things,

1167
00:58:25,099 --> 00:58:26,701
and this was unfixable,

1168
00:58:26,702 --> 00:58:28,069
and it was so stupid.

1169
00:58:28,070 --> 00:58:30,138
Once you start to
understand the indictments,

1170
00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:32,272
basically this is
what they said.

1171
00:58:32,273 --> 00:58:34,174
<i>Pretend we're in Wyoming</i>

1172
00:58:34,175 --> 00:58:36,135
<i>and we're standing in the
middle of the prairie,</i>

1173
00:58:36,136 --> 00:58:37,979
<i>and let's assume for a moment</i>

1174
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:39,980
<i>that the fence
is in the right place.</i>

1175
00:58:39,981 --> 00:58:42,783
<i>You're standing on this
side of the fence.</i>

1176
00:58:42,784 --> 00:58:44,718
<i>The government says
right over there</i>

1177
00:58:44,719 --> 00:58:46,959
<i>on the other side of the fence
is this fabulous fossil,</i>

1178
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,355
<i>and they're basically saying</i>

1179
00:58:48,356 --> 00:58:49,957
<i>that Pete and Neal and Bob</i>

1180
00:58:49,958 --> 00:58:52,627
and whoever was out there
would go...

1181
00:58:52,628 --> 00:58:53,861
step over the fence,

1182
00:58:53,862 --> 00:58:56,698
<i>wrongly, knowingly
pick up the fossil</i>

1183
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:58,219
<i>that they're not
supposed to pick up,</i>

1184
00:58:58,220 --> 00:59:00,868
carry it back over the
fence, put it in their car.

1185
00:59:00,869 --> 00:59:04,305
<i>When they drive from
Wyoming to South Dakota,</i>

1186
00:59:04,306 --> 00:59:06,306
<i>they then have conducted</i>

1187
00:59:06,307 --> 00:59:08,642
<i>an illegal act which is called</i>

1188
00:59:08,643 --> 00:59:10,944
<i>interstate transportation
of stolen property.</i>

1189
00:59:10,945 --> 00:59:12,577
<i>They get back to the Institute.</i>

1190
00:59:13,014 --> 00:59:14,816
<i>They would make a phone call,</i>

1191
00:59:14,817 --> 00:59:16,718
<i>send a fax, maybe, to Japan,</i>

1192
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:19,087
<i>and say, "We found the thing
that you were looking for."</i>

1193
00:59:19,088 --> 00:59:20,988
Do you want to buy it?"

1194
00:59:20,989 --> 00:59:23,091
Well, that's wire fraud.

1195
00:59:23,092 --> 00:59:25,759
<i>And then if the Japanese museum</i>

1196
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:27,895
<i>were to purchase that fossil</i>

1197
00:59:27,896 --> 00:59:29,832
and the guys would put
that money in the bank,

1198
00:59:30,032 --> 00:59:31,633
that's money laundering.

1199
00:59:31,634 --> 00:59:34,968
So basically the guys
were called conspirators

1200
00:59:34,969 --> 00:59:39,806
who were creating
this very elaborate scheme

1201
00:59:39,807 --> 00:59:41,676
to intentionally steal things

1202
00:59:41,677 --> 00:59:42,941
and sell them illegally.

1203
00:59:59,827 --> 01:00:01,235
<i>As the months went by,</i>

1204
01:00:01,262 --> 01:00:05,066
things seemed to get darker
and darker and darker.

1205
01:00:05,067 --> 01:00:06,734
For quite a while, we'd hoped

1206
01:00:06,735 --> 01:00:08,335
that they'll gain their senses

1207
01:00:08,336 --> 01:00:09,937
and this'll just go away.

1208
01:00:09,938 --> 01:00:13,306
Because it was so hotly
contested along the way,

1209
01:00:13,307 --> 01:00:16,276
I didn't think there
would be any chance

1210
01:00:16,277 --> 01:00:18,212
that this case would
settle before trial.

1211
01:00:18,213 --> 01:00:21,149
By late summer of '94,

1212
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:22,850
there were serious discussions

1213
01:00:22,851 --> 01:00:24,819
that were going on with the U.S.
Attorney's office

1214
01:00:25,019 --> 01:00:26,421
for a possible resolution.

1215
01:00:26,422 --> 01:00:28,355
I go out on my step one morning

1216
01:00:28,356 --> 01:00:29,825
and bring the "Rapid
City Journal" in

1217
01:00:30,025 --> 01:00:32,359
and have a cup of coffee,
and right on the front page

1218
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:34,364
<i>is the plea agreement announced.</i>

1219
01:00:36,364 --> 01:00:39,232
<i>Somebody spilled their guts</i>

1220
01:00:39,233 --> 01:00:40,968
<i>in front of Hugh O'Gara,</i>

1221
01:00:40,969 --> 01:00:43,303
and he might as well have
taken a gun and shot us.

1222
01:00:43,304 --> 01:00:44,971
<i>The article itself</i>

1223
01:00:44,972 --> 01:00:47,107
<i>suggested capitulation</i>

1224
01:00:47,108 --> 01:00:48,709
<i>on the part of the government.</i>

1225
01:00:48,710 --> 01:00:50,310
You never get a good deal done

1226
01:00:50,311 --> 01:00:52,145
if somebody is going to be cast

1227
01:00:52,146 --> 01:00:54,781
as having folded their tent.

1228
01:00:54,782 --> 01:00:57,417
<i>Anybody who would publish
that should know better,</i>

1229
01:00:57,418 --> 01:00:58,986
<i>so I called Hugh O'Gara,</i>

1230
01:00:58,987 --> 01:01:01,189
<i>and I just said,
"What were you thinking?</i>

1231
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:03,124
How could you do that?"

1232
01:01:03,125 --> 01:01:04,991
And he was near tears
on the phone.

1233
01:01:04,992 --> 01:01:06,393
He would not answer me.

1234
01:01:06,394 --> 01:01:07,995
Hugh would never...

1235
01:01:07,996 --> 01:01:10,098
obviously would not tell
me who that source was.

1236
01:01:10,099 --> 01:01:11,198
I wouldn't even ask him.

1237
01:01:11,199 --> 01:01:12,199
<i>The next morning,</i>

1238
01:01:13,001 --> 01:01:16,104
<i>the judge called all the
attorneys into chambers.</i>

1239
01:01:16,105 --> 01:01:18,939
<i>He went down the line
and made each of us</i>

1240
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:21,942
say that we were not
responsible for the leak.

1241
01:01:21,943 --> 01:01:25,747
He felt that the principals at
least deserved to go to jail.

1242
01:01:25,748 --> 01:01:27,814
He said that he would
not accept the plea.

1243
01:01:27,815 --> 01:01:29,450
He had prejudged the case,

1244
01:01:29,451 --> 01:01:31,852
and under two federal statutes,

1245
01:01:31,853 --> 01:01:34,821
a judge is obligated
to remove themselves

1246
01:01:34,822 --> 01:01:36,758
from sitting and hearing
the rest of the case.

1247
01:01:36,759 --> 01:01:38,225
So we filed immediately

1248
01:01:38,226 --> 01:01:40,294
<i>our second recusal motion</i>

1249
01:01:40,295 --> 01:01:42,296
<i>asking the judge to step down.</i>

1250
01:01:42,297 --> 01:01:45,031
<i>The thing that seems to
upset Judge Battey the most</i>

1251
01:01:45,032 --> 01:01:47,301
<i>is not whether he's fair,</i>

1252
01:01:47,302 --> 01:01:49,403
<i>but to be challenged
that he's not being fair,</i>

1253
01:01:49,404 --> 01:01:51,299
so he immediately
denied that motion.

1254
01:02:04,085 --> 01:02:07,087
I knew this case
was going to trial

1255
01:02:07,088 --> 01:02:10,424
the day the Hugh O'Gara article

1256
01:02:10,425 --> 01:02:12,583
was published in the
"Rapid City Journal."

1257
01:02:34,182 --> 01:02:36,216
<i>I'm not afraid of 12 people,</i>

1258
01:02:36,217 --> 01:02:38,819
<i>a jury of 12 people
of our peers.</i>

1259
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:40,988
I know that they'll
look at this case

1260
01:02:40,989 --> 01:02:43,089
and they'll see
the ridiculous way

1261
01:02:43,090 --> 01:02:44,524
in which the government
is behaving,

1262
01:02:44,525 --> 01:02:46,426
and they will vindicate us.

1263
01:02:46,427 --> 01:02:49,375
We're innocent of all the
things that we're charged with.

1264
01:03:04,045 --> 01:03:05,513
<i>So in the courtroom,</i>

1265
01:03:05,514 --> 01:03:07,415
<i>of course right in front</i>

1266
01:03:07,416 --> 01:03:09,517
<i>is Judge Battey and the bench.</i>

1267
01:03:09,518 --> 01:03:11,919
<i>Off to the left is the jury,</i>

1268
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:13,421
<i>12 jurors, two alternates,</i>

1269
01:03:13,422 --> 01:03:16,223
<i>a large space in between
where the lawyers</i>

1270
01:03:16,224 --> 01:03:18,593
<i>get to pace and walk and
show exhibits and things,</i>

1271
01:03:18,594 --> 01:03:20,861
<i>and then we have
the prosecution,</i>

1272
01:03:20,862 --> 01:03:23,233
<i>which had at times
two or three lawyers.</i>

1273
01:03:24,833 --> 01:03:27,313
<i>On our side, there was a
lawyer for each defendant,</i>

1274
01:03:27,314 --> 01:03:30,370
<i>so there were six lawyers
and five defendants,</i>

1275
01:03:30,371 --> 01:03:31,807
<i>the sixth defendant, of course,</i>

1276
01:03:32,007 --> 01:03:34,274
<i>being the Black Hills Institute.</i>

1277
01:03:34,275 --> 01:03:35,475
<i>Our trial was...</i>

1278
01:03:35,476 --> 01:03:37,210
and still is
the largest criminal case

1279
01:03:37,211 --> 01:03:39,211
that's ever been tried
in South Dakota.

1280
01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:43,551
<i>You cannot say</i>

1281
01:03:43,552 --> 01:03:45,620
<i>the word "Sue" in the trial.</i>

1282
01:03:45,621 --> 01:03:47,221
I mean, the jurors were going,

1283
01:03:47,222 --> 01:03:48,622
"What happened to Sue?

1284
01:03:48,623 --> 01:03:50,258
That's why they got these guys

1285
01:03:50,259 --> 01:03:51,892
in the court system,
right?"

1286
01:03:51,893 --> 01:03:54,472
The logistics of this trial
were incomprehensible.

1287
01:04:01,302 --> 01:04:04,038
The Institute has collected
maybe a million fossils.

1288
01:04:04,039 --> 01:04:07,308
This indictment
covers 14 of them,

1289
01:04:07,309 --> 01:04:09,310
and those 14 fossils

1290
01:04:09,311 --> 01:04:11,345
were collected from seven sites.

1291
01:04:11,346 --> 01:04:13,446
<i>In seven cases,</i>

1292
01:04:13,447 --> 01:04:15,818
<i>in all the years these guys
have been out in the field,</i>

1293
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:18,451
<i>they are accused of being
in the wrong place.</i>

1294
01:04:18,452 --> 01:04:20,254
<i>The government would simply</i>

1295
01:04:20,255 --> 01:04:22,089
<i>have their officials come in</i>

1296
01:04:22,090 --> 01:04:24,325
<i>of whatever agency
was going to be</i>

1297
01:04:24,326 --> 01:04:26,326
<i>taking the lead
for that particular site</i>

1298
01:04:26,327 --> 01:04:29,096
and would say, "I found where
the specimen was collected.

1299
01:04:29,097 --> 01:04:30,931
I knew, therefore,
it was on government land."

1300
01:04:30,932 --> 01:04:32,366
And to me, it just emphasized

1301
01:04:32,367 --> 01:04:35,102
the ridiculous nature
of this whole thing.

1302
01:04:35,103 --> 01:04:36,805
You know, I mean,
if it's 200 feet over

1303
01:04:37,005 --> 01:04:40,005
and you don't know where you
are, it would have been okay?

1304
01:04:43,927 --> 01:04:45,980
<i>His job had been
to appraise the fossils</i>

1305
01:04:45,981 --> 01:04:47,614
<i>that had been seized
in the case,</i>

1306
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:51,252
<i>and his evaluations would
be incredibly important,</i>

1307
01:04:51,253 --> 01:04:53,620
because they determined
whether a given count

1308
01:04:53,621 --> 01:04:55,260
was a misdemeanor or a felony.

1309
01:04:59,260 --> 01:05:02,296
<i>It was pretty easy
in cross-examination</i>

1310
01:05:02,297 --> 01:05:04,230
to discover that the man

1311
01:05:04,231 --> 01:05:06,366
had not opened
the field jackets.

1312
01:05:06,367 --> 01:05:09,370
He was telling us
the values of things

1313
01:05:09,371 --> 01:05:10,740
he had not even looked at.

1314
01:05:33,094 --> 01:05:35,147
<i>Pete and I, on one of
our trips to Peru,</i>

1315
01:05:35,865 --> 01:05:37,497
<i>we were taking $15,000 in cash,</i>

1316
01:05:37,498 --> 01:05:39,399
<i>because down there,</i>

1317
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:42,403
<i>you can't use credit cards
or anything else.</i>

1318
01:05:42,404 --> 01:05:45,404
<i>And he withdrew $15,000 from
the bank, and we split it up.</i>

1319
01:05:45,984 --> 01:05:47,774
Just in case
one person got robbed,

1320
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:49,377
at least they
wouldn't lose everything.

1321
01:05:49,378 --> 01:05:51,578
Susan Hendrickson carried 8,000.

1322
01:05:51,579 --> 01:05:53,214
I carried $7,000 down

1323
01:05:53,215 --> 01:05:54,614
one of the trips of cash.

1324
01:05:54,615 --> 01:05:56,283
<i>We were building a museum,</i>

1325
01:05:56,284 --> 01:05:58,319
<i>paying for the bricks and mortar</i>

1326
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:01,163
<i>and doing the work ourselves
with our Swiss colleagues.</i>

1327
01:06:09,030 --> 01:06:10,430
<i>In Japan, they...</i>

1328
01:06:10,431 --> 01:06:12,299
<i>the museums pay in cash.</i>

1329
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:14,100
<i>They always have.
Didn't want to carry</i>

1330
01:06:14,101 --> 01:06:16,037
<i>bundles of cash on the
plane, so we went</i>

1331
01:06:16,038 --> 01:06:18,272
to a bank and put it
in traveler's checks.

1332
01:06:18,273 --> 01:06:19,672
They were all restrictively

1333
01:06:19,673 --> 01:06:21,174
endorsed traveler's checks,

1334
01:06:21,175 --> 01:06:22,576
all stamped for deposit only,

1335
01:06:22,577 --> 01:06:24,578
deposited in the bank.
Paid taxes on them.

1336
01:06:24,579 --> 01:06:26,413
<i>Prosecution had four
different witnesses,</i>

1337
01:06:26,414 --> 01:06:27,580
<i>all of whom testified</i>

1338
01:06:27,581 --> 01:06:29,417
<i>that restrictively endorsed</i>

1339
01:06:29,418 --> 01:06:31,258
<i>traveler's checks do not
need to be declared.</i>

1340
01:06:31,259 --> 01:06:34,120
What struck me about
the prosecution's case

1341
01:06:34,121 --> 01:06:35,790
was how complex it was.

1342
01:06:35,791 --> 01:06:38,091
People had to understand

1343
01:06:38,092 --> 01:06:41,194
<i>the arcane ins and outs</i>

1344
01:06:41,195 --> 01:06:43,430
<i>of bringing traveler's checks</i>

1345
01:06:43,431 --> 01:06:45,165
<i>into the country</i>

1346
01:06:45,166 --> 01:06:48,169
<i>and latitudes and
longitudes on public lands.</i>

1347
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:51,171
<i>And I think they did it
in an organized way,</i>

1348
01:06:51,172 --> 01:06:53,488
but it was a very, very
complicated argument.

1349
01:06:59,213 --> 01:07:01,114
<i>When the prosecution rested,</i>

1350
01:07:01,115 --> 01:07:04,819
I felt we had put on
the evidence that we had.

1351
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:08,154
<i>We had their own pictures of
them taking these fossils.</i>

1352
01:07:08,155 --> 01:07:11,325
<i>We had their own field notes of
them collecting these fossils.</i>

1353
01:07:11,326 --> 01:07:14,627
We had given it
100% of our effort

1354
01:07:14,628 --> 01:07:16,266
to show what they did.

1355
01:07:19,266 --> 01:07:22,736
<i>As the defense
proceeded to present</i>

1356
01:07:22,737 --> 01:07:24,205
many fewer witnesses to say,

1357
01:07:24,206 --> 01:07:25,839
"Look, it's not
that complicated.

1358
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:27,374
We were collecting fossils.

1359
01:07:27,375 --> 01:07:29,243
We thought we had
permission to be there.

1360
01:07:29,244 --> 01:07:31,278
In this case, we weren't
where you thought we were.

1361
01:07:31,279 --> 01:07:33,385
In this case, we were.
It's that simple."

1362
01:07:37,990 --> 01:07:40,254
<i>As we were approaching
the end of the trial,</i>

1363
01:07:40,255 --> 01:07:41,589
<i>Neal and I both felt</i>

1364
01:07:41,590 --> 01:07:44,390
that it was important
for him to testify.

1365
01:07:44,391 --> 01:07:46,759
<i>3 1/2 days, I was
on the witness stand,</i>

1366
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:48,796
<i>and for 3 1/2 days, I swore</i>

1367
01:07:48,797 --> 01:07:50,464
to tell the truth,
the whole truth,

1368
01:07:50,465 --> 01:07:52,623
and nothing but the
truth, so help me God.

1369
01:08:00,175 --> 01:08:02,142
<i>Pete ended up not testifying.</i>

1370
01:08:02,143 --> 01:08:03,776
State had not proven its case.

1371
01:08:03,777 --> 01:08:05,346
The state doesn't
prove their case,

1372
01:08:05,347 --> 01:08:08,816
your client doesn't
take the stand, period.

1373
01:08:08,817 --> 01:08:10,683
And so on the advice of counsel,

1374
01:08:10,684 --> 01:08:12,539
I did not testify.

1375
01:08:31,539 --> 01:08:33,239
<i>The jury came back today</i>

1376
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:35,442
in the Hill City fossil hunter
federal criminal trial.

1377
01:08:35,443 --> 01:08:38,179
<i>The jury said
over and over again</i>

1378
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:39,913
<i>either not guilty</i>

1379
01:08:39,914 --> 01:08:42,183
<i>or no unanimous verdict
could be reached.</i>

1380
01:08:42,184 --> 01:08:44,451
<i>Of over 150 charges,</i>

1381
01:08:44,452 --> 01:08:47,188
<i>the jury agreed to convict
only 13 times,</i>

1382
01:08:47,189 --> 01:08:49,723
<i>and five of those convictions
are for misdemeanor crimes.</i>

1383
01:08:49,724 --> 01:08:52,459
<i>So here is how
the convictions break down.</i>

1384
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:55,328
<i>Pete Larson, co-owner and
founder of the Institute,</i>

1385
01:08:55,329 --> 01:08:57,363
<i>is convicted on two counts
of misdemeanor thefts</i>

1386
01:08:57,364 --> 01:08:58,732
<i>and two felony counts</i>

1387
01:08:58,733 --> 01:09:00,334
<i>of illegally transporting money</i>

1388
01:09:00,335 --> 01:09:01,669
<i>in and out of the country.</i>

1389
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:03,670
<i>Brother Neal Larson found guilty</i>

1390
01:09:03,671 --> 01:09:05,305
<i>of one misdemeanor theft.</i>

1391
01:09:05,306 --> 01:09:06,874
<i>The jury either acquitted Neal</i>

1392
01:09:06,875 --> 01:09:09,210
<i>or couldn't agree
on a verdict for the others.</i>

1393
01:09:09,211 --> 01:09:12,212
<i>Bob Farrar, a third
co-owner of the Institute,</i>

1394
01:09:12,213 --> 01:09:13,846
<i>convicted of two felonies,</i>

1395
01:09:13,847 --> 01:09:16,750
<i>making false statements
to customs officials.</i>

1396
01:09:16,751 --> 01:09:18,919
<i>And the Black Hills
Institute as a corporation</i>

1397
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:20,888
<i>is convicted
of two misdemeanor thefts,</i>

1398
01:09:20,889 --> 01:09:22,488
<i>a felony theft</i>

1399
01:09:22,489 --> 01:09:23,890
<i>and twice making
false statements</i>

1400
01:09:23,891 --> 01:09:25,492
<i>to customs officials.</i>

1401
01:09:25,493 --> 01:09:26,961
<i>The jury also
found the Institute</i>

1402
01:09:26,962 --> 01:09:28,895
guilty of bringing goods
in the States

1403
01:09:28,896 --> 01:09:30,598
by making a false statement.

1404
01:09:30,599 --> 01:09:32,966
Defendants Eddie Cole
and Terry Wentz

1405
01:09:32,967 --> 01:09:35,307
were not convicted
on any charges.

1406
01:09:40,247 --> 01:09:41,774
<i>As the verdict was announced,</i>

1407
01:09:41,775 --> 01:09:44,778
it was almost
impossible to believe

1408
01:09:44,779 --> 01:09:47,614
that the defense hadn't
scored a great victory.

1409
01:09:47,615 --> 01:09:50,251
However, there were

1410
01:09:50,252 --> 01:09:53,254
some fairly significant
felony convictions

1411
01:09:53,255 --> 01:09:55,922
The expression, "you could have
knocked me over with a feather"...

1412
01:09:55,923 --> 01:09:58,626
you could have knocked
me over with a feather.

1413
01:09:58,627 --> 01:10:01,495
<i>I talked to some jurors
after the trail.</i>

1414
01:10:01,496 --> 01:10:03,264
<i>Some of them were near tears</i>

1415
01:10:03,265 --> 01:10:05,633
<i>when I interviewed them
about how they</i>

1416
01:10:05,634 --> 01:10:08,535
had hoped they could acquit
on every single charge.

1417
01:10:08,536 --> 01:10:10,371
<i>I believed they had to have</i>

1418
01:10:10,372 --> 01:10:12,305
<i>something to take this to trial,</i>

1419
01:10:12,306 --> 01:10:14,546
<i>and I spend the whole trial
waiting for that something.</i>

1420
01:10:14,547 --> 01:10:16,309
Without a doubt,

1421
01:10:16,310 --> 01:10:18,014
the majority of the jurors

1422
01:10:19,014 --> 01:10:22,622
wanted this whole case
dropped and put away.

1423
01:11:00,579 --> 01:11:02,790
<i>Maurice Williams,
the rancher who found Sue</i>

1424
01:11:02,791 --> 01:11:04,457
<i>has received at least six offers</i>

1425
01:11:04,458 --> 01:11:07,094
to purchase the T. rex.
Since the courts determined

1426
01:11:07,095 --> 01:11:09,897
<i>that the fossil is part of
Williams' trust property,</i>

1427
01:11:09,898 --> 01:11:13,099
<i>any purchase must be approved
by the federal government.</i>

1428
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:15,903
<i>Since Sue was seized
by federal agents in 1992,</i>

1429
01:11:15,904 --> 01:11:18,471
<i>the fossil has been stored
at the School of Mines.</i>

1430
01:11:18,472 --> 01:11:20,674
<i>My first contact with
Mr. Maurice Williams</i>

1431
01:11:20,675 --> 01:11:22,742
<i>was when he came to Aberdeen</i>

1432
01:11:22,743 --> 01:11:24,344
<i>for a series of meetings,</i>

1433
01:11:24,345 --> 01:11:27,348
to discuss

1434
01:11:27,349 --> 01:11:29,416
what he should do

1435
01:11:29,417 --> 01:11:30,751
with this fossil.

1436
01:11:30,752 --> 01:11:32,685
The idea that I had

1437
01:11:32,686 --> 01:11:36,622
was to convene, like, a
panel of paleontologists

1438
01:11:36,623 --> 01:11:39,859
to do an in-depth study
of this fossil

1439
01:11:39,860 --> 01:11:42,395
with the hope that it would
end up in a museum somewhere.

1440
01:11:42,396 --> 01:11:43,796
But in the meantime,

1441
01:11:43,797 --> 01:11:46,032
while this was being discussed,

1442
01:11:46,033 --> 01:11:49,975
Mr. Williams decided that he
would rather sell the fossil.

1443
01:11:54,975 --> 01:11:57,644
<i>Maurice Williams
had a stack of proposals</i>

1444
01:11:57,645 --> 01:11:59,513
<i>from all sorts of people
all over the place.</i>

1445
01:11:59,514 --> 01:12:00,674
<i>I mean, everybody wanted it.</i>

1446
01:12:00,675 --> 01:12:02,049
I called up Maurice,

1447
01:12:02,050 --> 01:12:04,385
and I said I'm going to come out

1448
01:12:04,386 --> 01:12:06,586
to South Dakota if you want,
and I'll visit with you,

1449
01:12:06,587 --> 01:12:07,920
and he said great.

1450
01:12:07,921 --> 01:12:09,956
And I actually visited

1451
01:12:09,957 --> 01:12:12,960
the boxes
in which Sue was located

1452
01:12:12,961 --> 01:12:15,496
in the South Dakota
School of Mines

1453
01:12:15,497 --> 01:12:17,464
with Maurice's family,

1454
01:12:17,465 --> 01:12:19,399
who had never
actually been there.

1455
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:22,403
<i>This was the first time
they'd actually seen Sue.</i>

1456
01:12:22,404 --> 01:12:25,406
<i>What one really saw inside
that sort of garage area</i>

1457
01:12:25,407 --> 01:12:27,441
<i>was this extraordinary,</i>

1458
01:12:27,442 --> 01:12:31,411
<i>almost "Citizen Kane" vision
of boxes and boxes and boxes.</i>

1459
01:12:31,412 --> 01:12:34,514
<i>Maurice and I had
numerous conversations.</i>

1460
01:12:34,515 --> 01:12:36,726
<i>We talked about the
responsibility involved</i>

1461
01:12:37,018 --> 01:12:40,554
<i>in dealing with this
extraordinary fossil.</i>

1462
01:12:40,555 --> 01:12:42,523
Nothing quite like it
had ever been sold before.

1463
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:44,090
It had to go to the right place,

1464
01:12:44,091 --> 01:12:46,626
but adjudicating which place

1465
01:12:46,627 --> 01:12:48,694
was the right place
was complicated,

1466
01:12:48,695 --> 01:12:51,695
and the auction process, in
fact, could help resolve that.

1467
01:13:05,646 --> 01:13:07,113
<i>We're going in to court.</i>

1468
01:13:07,114 --> 01:13:10,117
<i>We'd already had an indication</i>

1469
01:13:10,118 --> 01:13:11,852
that the judge wasn't
too pleased with us

1470
01:13:11,853 --> 01:13:14,455
because we asked him
to recuse himself.

1471
01:13:14,456 --> 01:13:16,857
It was pretty clear

1472
01:13:16,858 --> 01:13:20,861
<i>that Judge Battey was
irritated by the defense.</i>

1473
01:13:20,862 --> 01:13:22,161
<i>We had to go back</i>

1474
01:13:22,162 --> 01:13:23,764
<i>to the same tables
with our attorneys</i>

1475
01:13:23,765 --> 01:13:26,166
<i>and sit there and then stand up</i>

1476
01:13:26,167 --> 01:13:28,167
<i>as Judge Battey sentenced us.</i>

1477
01:13:28,168 --> 01:13:30,203
He also wanted to hear

1478
01:13:30,204 --> 01:13:32,257
that we were sorry
for what we had done.

1479
01:13:39,247 --> 01:13:40,880
<i>For Peter Larson,</i>

1480
01:13:40,881 --> 01:13:43,617
recommended guideline range

1481
01:13:43,618 --> 01:13:44,671
for the two felonies

1482
01:13:45,019 --> 01:13:46,620
of which he was convicted

1483
01:13:46,621 --> 01:13:48,154
was zero to six months.

1484
01:13:48,155 --> 01:13:49,824
It really looked
like the sentence

1485
01:13:50,024 --> 01:13:52,027
would be minimal,
probably probation.

1486
01:13:52,774 --> 01:13:54,827
When he did come down
with his sentence,

1487
01:13:54,828 --> 01:13:57,831
he enhanced it, so instead
of zero to six months,

1488
01:13:57,832 --> 01:14:01,980
he sentenced me to two years in
prison and two years probation.

1489
01:14:12,980 --> 01:14:14,547
<i>To send him to jail,</i>

1490
01:14:14,548 --> 01:14:17,019
to prison for two years
for this offense,

1491
01:14:18,019 --> 01:14:21,023
was absolutely
no justification for it.

1492
01:14:22,023 --> 01:14:25,058
It was indefensible,

1493
01:14:25,059 --> 01:14:28,694
ugly behavior.

1494
01:14:28,695 --> 01:14:31,167
It just took my breath away.

1495
01:14:34,167 --> 01:14:36,702
How could they do that?

1496
01:14:36,703 --> 01:14:38,604
This is America?
This is justice?

1497
01:14:38,605 --> 01:14:40,974
This is, you know, the
country we live in?

1498
01:14:40,975 --> 01:14:42,975
Every "Geographic" photographer

1499
01:14:42,976 --> 01:14:44,978
in the last 30 years
would be in jail.

1500
01:14:44,979 --> 01:14:46,619
You know, you're
coming back with $10,000.

1501
01:14:46,620 --> 01:14:47,860
Well, you reported it going in.

1502
01:14:47,861 --> 01:14:49,282
You come back out.
Do you report it?

1503
01:14:49,283 --> 01:14:50,723
No, 'cause they're
not countersigned.

1504
01:14:50,724 --> 01:14:51,919
The reason the judge did

1505
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:53,319
is because he had been urged,

1506
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:55,855
he had been convinced
by guys with PhDs

1507
01:14:55,856 --> 01:14:58,858
at university museums
it had to be done

1508
01:14:58,859 --> 01:15:01,862
for the safety of our
science and our fossils,

1509
01:15:01,863 --> 01:15:03,330
and that was so totally wrong.

1510
01:15:03,331 --> 01:15:05,268
Peter Larson was
made an example...

1511
01:15:07,268 --> 01:15:08,801
...with that sentence.

1512
01:15:08,802 --> 01:15:11,804
I don't...

1513
01:15:11,805 --> 01:15:13,340
have a real good recollection

1514
01:15:13,341 --> 01:15:15,145
of those...

1515
01:15:16,824 --> 01:15:19,246
...those next few hours,
I guess you might say.

1516
01:15:19,247 --> 01:15:21,113
<i>Federal Judge
in Rapid City today</i>

1517
01:15:21,114 --> 01:15:24,151
<i>sentenced Peter Larson
to two years in prison</i>

1518
01:15:24,152 --> 01:15:25,885
<i>and a $5,000 fine.</i>

1519
01:15:25,886 --> 01:15:28,121
<i>Larson was found guilty
last year of charges</i>

1520
01:15:28,122 --> 01:15:29,790
<i>connected to his commercial</i>

1521
01:15:29,791 --> 01:15:31,358
<i>fossil-hunting business
in Hill City.</i>

1522
01:15:31,359 --> 01:15:33,260
<i>It's the final chapter
in the case that began</i>

1523
01:15:33,261 --> 01:15:35,328
<i>with the discovery of Sue,</i>

1524
01:15:35,329 --> 01:15:37,277
<i>the most complete
Tyrannosaurus rex...</i>

1525
01:16:31,819 --> 01:16:36,055
<i>I was to turn myself in
at the gate,</i>

1526
01:16:36,056 --> 01:16:38,191
<i>the same prison that
Timothy McVeigh was</i>

1527
01:16:38,192 --> 01:16:39,792
<i>and John Gotti.</i>

1528
01:16:39,793 --> 01:16:42,328
<i>And I was using a cane.
I could barely walk.</i>

1529
01:16:42,329 --> 01:16:44,264
<i>Just a few months before that,</i>

1530
01:16:44,265 --> 01:16:45,799
<i>broken my leg quite badly.</i>

1531
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:47,300
<i>When I surrendered at the gate,</i>

1532
01:16:47,301 --> 01:16:49,336
they said, "We're going
to take your cane."

1533
01:16:49,337 --> 01:16:52,072
I said, "If you take my cane,
I'm going to fall over,"

1534
01:16:52,073 --> 01:16:54,306
because I really couldn't
stand without my cane.

1535
01:16:54,307 --> 01:16:55,907
<i>And they would say,
"Well, let me see."</i>

1536
01:16:56,010 --> 01:16:58,178
<i>And so he's stumbling around,</i>

1537
01:16:58,179 --> 01:17:00,346
<i>and it was pitiful.
It was so insulting,</i>

1538
01:17:00,347 --> 01:17:03,082
I just felt so bad for him.

1539
01:17:03,083 --> 01:17:04,917
<i>And I was totally powerless.</i>

1540
01:17:04,918 --> 01:17:06,952
<i>There's nothing you can do.</i>

1541
01:17:06,953 --> 01:17:09,355
<i>She was not next to tears.</i>

1542
01:17:09,356 --> 01:17:10,924
She was way past that.

1543
01:17:10,925 --> 01:17:14,827
I just...
it broke my heart.

1544
01:17:14,828 --> 01:17:17,330
<i>There's finally a time
when the man</i>

1545
01:17:17,331 --> 01:17:20,332
<i>said, "Get out of here,"</i>

1546
01:17:20,333 --> 01:17:22,269
so I drove around him,

1547
01:17:22,270 --> 01:17:25,272
and then I couldn't
see him anymore.

1548
01:17:25,273 --> 01:17:27,840
And the only choice you have
is to go out the driveway

1549
01:17:27,841 --> 01:17:31,711
<i>and turn on the desolate road</i>

1550
01:17:31,712 --> 01:17:34,715
<i>and drive 10 hours,</i>

1551
01:17:34,716 --> 01:17:37,050
you know, home.

1552
01:17:37,051 --> 01:17:40,821
I think I screamed
for about 10 minutes,

1553
01:17:40,822 --> 01:17:42,255
driving.

1554
01:17:42,256 --> 01:17:43,956
It was wild.

1555
01:17:43,957 --> 01:17:45,992
I didn't have any other choice.

1556
01:17:45,993 --> 01:17:47,394
I had to get it out.

1557
01:17:47,395 --> 01:17:49,864
It was hard.

1558
01:17:50,864 --> 01:17:54,867
It was the hardest thing
I ever did ever.

1559
01:17:54,868 --> 01:17:58,337
The guard who was there
filling out the paperwork

1560
01:17:58,338 --> 01:17:59,939
said,
"Have you seen this?"

1561
01:17:59,940 --> 01:18:01,742
And I said, "Seen what?"
And he said,

1562
01:18:01,743 --> 01:18:04,745
"Come here," and he looked
at the piece of paper,

1563
01:18:04,746 --> 01:18:08,314
and it said, "Reason
for incarceration:

1564
01:18:08,315 --> 01:18:10,751
failure
to fill out forms."

1565
01:18:10,752 --> 01:18:13,910
And he said, "Man, you must have
really pissed somebody off."

1566
01:18:55,496 --> 01:18:58,364
<i>Prison was very surreal.</i>

1567
01:18:58,365 --> 01:18:59,366
<i>Um...</i>

1568
01:18:59,367 --> 01:19:02,335
the thing about prison

1569
01:19:02,336 --> 01:19:06,072
is not the fact that
you're in prison,

1570
01:19:06,073 --> 01:19:08,073
so much as you are kept

1571
01:19:08,074 --> 01:19:10,210
from your family
and your friends.

1572
01:19:10,211 --> 01:19:12,077
After a couple of weeks,

1573
01:19:12,078 --> 01:19:14,447
I said, "I have an idea.

1574
01:19:14,448 --> 01:19:16,148
They used to have
a little thing here

1575
01:19:16,149 --> 01:19:18,484
that they called Saturday
morning lectures

1576
01:19:18,485 --> 01:19:20,086
and people who
would give lectures.

1577
01:19:20,087 --> 01:19:21,487
They aren't doing that anymore.

1578
01:19:21,488 --> 01:19:23,223
I'd like to start that up again.

1579
01:19:23,224 --> 01:19:25,157
We've got lawyers.
We've got doctors.

1580
01:19:25,158 --> 01:19:27,227
We've got physical therapists.
We've got Realtors.

1581
01:19:27,228 --> 01:19:28,988
We've got drug dealers
too and counterfeiters

1582
01:19:28,989 --> 01:19:30,362
and all kinds
of things like that,

1583
01:19:30,363 --> 01:19:32,364
but these drug dealers

1584
01:19:32,365 --> 01:19:35,969
who've never had a different
job in their life,

1585
01:19:35,970 --> 01:19:38,138
I think would be helpful

1586
01:19:38,139 --> 01:19:40,172
for them to learn how to
do these other things."

1587
01:19:40,173 --> 01:19:42,309
We went down there.
You have to get clearance,

1588
01:19:42,310 --> 01:19:44,243
and, you know, it's like
you're surrounded

1589
01:19:44,244 --> 01:19:46,179
by all these... you know,
he's got a uniform

1590
01:19:46,180 --> 01:19:48,047
with, you know, the
numbers on it and stuff.

1591
01:19:48,048 --> 01:19:50,617
He says, "Well, I'm, you know,
leading the debate club,

1592
01:19:50,618 --> 01:19:53,286
and I have a paleontological
club that I'm working on.

1593
01:19:53,287 --> 01:19:56,121
They have some great, you
know, minerals around here."

1594
01:19:56,122 --> 01:19:58,090
He was teaching
the prisoners how to,

1595
01:19:58,091 --> 01:19:59,492
you know, do paleontology

1596
01:19:59,493 --> 01:20:00,993
right there
on the prison grounds.

1597
01:20:00,994 --> 01:20:02,562
That's what it's like with Pete.

1598
01:20:02,563 --> 01:20:04,997
I mean, he will find the beauty
in everything around him.

1599
01:20:04,998 --> 01:20:07,867
<i>The other inmates loved him,</i>

1600
01:20:07,868 --> 01:20:09,803
<i>and it was very clear
that they protected him.</i>

1601
01:20:10,003 --> 01:20:11,504
<i>They...</i> not like,

1602
01:20:11,505 --> 01:20:14,040
you know, in a movie where
they beat people up for him,

1603
01:20:14,041 --> 01:20:16,309
but just they took care
of him in some way,

1604
01:20:16,310 --> 01:20:19,144
like they just felt
a proprietary interest

1605
01:20:19,145 --> 01:20:21,015
for him, like he was special,

1606
01:20:22,015 --> 01:20:23,550
and it was very sweet to see

1607
01:20:23,551 --> 01:20:26,109
that they saw who he was.

1608
01:20:48,109 --> 01:20:50,911
<i>When finally the day came,</i>

1609
01:20:50,912 --> 01:20:52,578
<i>I'm riding all night long</i>

1610
01:20:52,579 --> 01:20:54,447
<i>on this bus that stops
every five minutes.</i>

1611
01:20:54,448 --> 01:20:55,816
<i>I couldn't go pick up Pete.</i>

1612
01:20:56,016 --> 01:20:58,050
He had to get on a bus,
a public bus.

1613
01:20:58,051 --> 01:20:59,920
<i>'Cause you're still
technically in prison.</i>

1614
01:20:59,921 --> 01:21:01,321
<i>I'm still serving my sentence.</i>

1615
01:21:01,322 --> 01:21:03,389
<i>Riding in the bus,</i>

1616
01:21:03,390 --> 01:21:06,393
even though it was
driving all night long,

1617
01:21:06,394 --> 01:21:07,394
was great.

1618
01:21:09,130 --> 01:21:11,197
<i>It was my first taste of freedom</i>

1619
01:21:11,198 --> 01:21:13,599
<i>for 18 months, where I'm
out of this prison.</i>

1620
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:15,402
<i>It was great.</i>

1621
01:21:15,403 --> 01:21:17,069
<i>It was great.</i>

1622
01:21:17,070 --> 01:21:19,305
He was back home. I mean,
he was under house arrest,

1623
01:21:19,306 --> 01:21:21,340
but he was back home.
We could see him.

1624
01:21:21,341 --> 01:21:23,943
<i>Eventually I'm released
from the halfway house</i>

1625
01:21:23,944 --> 01:21:26,679
<i>to home confinement, where I
can only go from home to work,</i>

1626
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:28,715
<i>so I get to walk across
the alley every morning</i>

1627
01:21:28,716 --> 01:21:31,653
and across the alley back
home at night, and that's it.

1628
01:21:32,653 --> 01:21:34,286
<i>When Pete got out of prison,</i>

1629
01:21:34,287 --> 01:21:36,322
<i>he was not the person
he was when he left.</i>

1630
01:21:36,323 --> 01:21:38,491
He was very reclusive.

1631
01:21:38,492 --> 01:21:40,426
He was very withdrawn.

1632
01:21:40,427 --> 01:21:42,962
He had to reorient

1633
01:21:42,963 --> 01:21:45,965
to normal interactions
with people.

1634
01:21:45,966 --> 01:21:49,269
<i>The Institute was
a little gloomier.</i>

1635
01:21:49,270 --> 01:21:51,103
<i>We still didn't know</i>

1636
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:53,340
<i>how the long-term effects
of this would leave us.</i>

1637
01:21:53,341 --> 01:21:56,608
We just had to keep
plugging along

1638
01:21:56,609 --> 01:21:58,662
<i>and try to cope
as well as we could.</i>

1639
01:22:15,662 --> 01:22:17,263
<i>While I was in prison,</i>

1640
01:22:17,264 --> 01:22:18,665
<i>Sue was also still in prison,</i>

1641
01:22:18,666 --> 01:22:20,233
<i>and there were rumors</i>

1642
01:22:20,234 --> 01:22:21,794
<i>that Sue was going
to be auctioned off</i>

1643
01:22:21,795 --> 01:22:23,731
<i>to the highest bidder.</i>

1644
01:22:24,671 --> 01:22:28,273
<i>It really was obvious
to me by that time</i>

1645
01:22:28,274 --> 01:22:30,175
<i>that the only way
to get her away</i>

1646
01:22:30,176 --> 01:22:31,896
from Maurice Williams
was through Sotheby's.

1647
01:22:31,897 --> 01:22:35,247
All of us were aware that the
auction was taking place.

1648
01:22:35,248 --> 01:22:37,751
It would probably sell for
a million or $2 million.

1649
01:22:37,752 --> 01:22:40,386
The big fear was that
it was going to be sold

1650
01:22:40,387 --> 01:22:42,221
to some private individual.

1651
01:22:42,222 --> 01:22:44,189
I know there were
a lot of people

1652
01:22:44,190 --> 01:22:47,160
concerned that it
might be bought

1653
01:22:47,161 --> 01:22:48,681
by an institution
in a foreign country.

1654
01:22:48,682 --> 01:22:50,362
That was a big concern
with the media,

1655
01:22:50,363 --> 01:22:52,698
was that it was going to be
sold and lost to science

1656
01:22:52,699 --> 01:22:55,801
and sold and put in a
private room someplace.

1657
01:22:55,802 --> 01:22:58,804
We always felt an
extraordinary obligation

1658
01:22:58,805 --> 01:23:00,572
to get this fossil
to the right home.

1659
01:23:00,573 --> 01:23:03,042
<i>Clearly there were a lot</i>

1660
01:23:03,043 --> 01:23:04,477
<i>of really interested parties</i>

1661
01:23:04,478 --> 01:23:07,147
that were hoping and
praying they had a shot.

1662
01:23:07,148 --> 01:23:09,581
We had dreams

1663
01:23:09,582 --> 01:23:11,184
after the auction
started developing

1664
01:23:11,185 --> 01:23:13,153
that perhaps
we could buy her back.

1665
01:23:13,154 --> 01:23:15,188
A wonderful philanthropist
from our area

1666
01:23:15,189 --> 01:23:16,589
Stan Adelstein,

1667
01:23:16,590 --> 01:23:19,425
really wanted to help get
Sue back to South Dakota.

1668
01:23:19,426 --> 01:23:20,727
In visiting with Pete,

1669
01:23:20,728 --> 01:23:22,362
I was fascinated

1670
01:23:22,363 --> 01:23:24,464
with the possibility

1671
01:23:24,465 --> 01:23:27,166
that we'd have
this fantastic dinosaur

1672
01:23:27,167 --> 01:23:29,301
back in the state
where she belonged.

1673
01:23:29,302 --> 01:23:32,471
Stan came ready
and willing to spend

1674
01:23:32,472 --> 01:23:34,607
a million-point-two
of his own money.

1675
01:23:34,608 --> 01:23:36,576
I just had hopes
we could make it work.

1676
01:23:36,577 --> 01:23:38,812
There's still hope Sue
will make it back home.

1677
01:23:38,813 --> 01:23:40,447
Stanford Adelstein
will bid on Sue

1678
01:23:40,448 --> 01:23:42,482
and try to bring her home
to the Black Hills.

1679
01:23:42,483 --> 01:23:44,149
Sue, the dinosaur that goes

1680
01:23:44,150 --> 01:23:45,551
on the auction block tomorrow

1681
01:23:45,552 --> 01:23:47,853
has traveled a rocky road
since she was found.

1682
01:23:47,854 --> 01:23:50,355
<i>Right now,
Larson's heart is broken.</i>

1683
01:23:50,356 --> 01:23:52,625
<i>He's lost
his most important find</i>

1684
01:23:52,626 --> 01:23:54,661
<i>and cannot even see her sold</i>

1685
01:23:54,662 --> 01:23:56,261
<i>because Larson
is under house arrest.</i>

1686
01:23:56,262 --> 01:23:58,564
And I'm still
only on work release.

1687
01:23:58,565 --> 01:24:00,265
So they asked me
to go out there.

1688
01:24:00,266 --> 01:24:02,234
<i>So they flew me out to New York,</i>

1689
01:24:02,235 --> 01:24:04,636
<i>and I helped them kind of
unpack some of the bones.</i>

1690
01:24:04,637 --> 01:24:07,239
<i>So much was still in jackets.</i>

1691
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:09,642
<i>We left those in jackets.
We thought that was,</i>

1692
01:24:09,643 --> 01:24:11,877
<i>first of all, the right
thing to do scientifically,</i>

1693
01:24:11,878 --> 01:24:15,114
<i>but also it looked fascinating,</i>

1694
01:24:15,115 --> 01:24:16,515
<i>absolutely fascinating,</i>

1695
01:24:16,516 --> 01:24:18,251
<i>and of course
the centerpiece of it all</i>

1696
01:24:18,252 --> 01:24:20,219
<i>was that astonishing skull,</i>

1697
01:24:20,220 --> 01:24:22,221
absolutely amazing.

1698
01:24:22,222 --> 01:24:23,622
<i>Kristin and Stan Adelstein</i>

1699
01:24:23,623 --> 01:24:25,224
<i>are there.
They're going to try</i>

1700
01:24:25,225 --> 01:24:26,559
<i>to buy the dinosaur for us.</i>

1701
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:28,161
<i>And Terry Wentz
is there, you know,</i>

1702
01:24:28,162 --> 01:24:30,196
<i>the guy who fought for
this dinosaur forever.</i>

1703
01:24:30,197 --> 01:24:31,430
<i>Susan Hendrickson is there.</i>

1704
01:24:31,431 --> 01:24:33,666
Everybody's anticipating
this auction.

1705
01:24:33,667 --> 01:24:36,825
I'm thinking, you know, "We have a chance.
We have a chance."

1706
01:24:43,543 --> 01:24:45,344
<i>The day of the auction,</i>

1707
01:24:45,345 --> 01:24:47,679
<i>the place is just absolutely
full of excitement.</i>

1708
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:50,383
<i>Television cameras everywhere.</i>

1709
01:24:50,384 --> 01:24:51,550
<i>A lot of reporters.</i>

1710
01:24:51,551 --> 01:24:53,286
<i>The room was completely full.</i>

1711
01:24:53,287 --> 01:24:56,288
<i>Maurice Williams
was in a private room</i>

1712
01:24:56,289 --> 01:24:59,158
<i>up above the auction area</i>

1713
01:24:59,159 --> 01:25:00,719
<i>so he could watch
everything going on.</i>

1714
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:02,828
<i>Sotheby's had arranged</i>

1715
01:25:02,829 --> 01:25:05,665
<i>for one of the people who
would normally be taking bids</i>

1716
01:25:05,666 --> 01:25:07,567
to give me a running
detail on the telephone

1717
01:25:07,568 --> 01:25:10,370
<i>about what was happening
at the auction.</i>

1718
01:25:10,371 --> 01:25:11,770
<i>I was at the Institute too.</i>

1719
01:25:11,771 --> 01:25:13,639
<i>I could not bear
to listen to the phone.</i>

1720
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:15,909
It was too much.

1721
01:25:26,053 --> 01:25:27,813
Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen,

1722
01:25:27,814 --> 01:25:29,354
and welcome to Sotheby's.

1723
01:25:29,355 --> 01:25:30,622
We have for auction today

1724
01:25:30,623 --> 01:25:33,358
the fossil
of a Tyrannosaurus rex

1725
01:25:33,359 --> 01:25:34,827
known as Sue,

1726
01:25:34,828 --> 01:25:37,596
the property of
the United States of America

1727
01:25:37,597 --> 01:25:41,600
in trust of Maurice Williams
of Faith, South Dakota.

1728
01:25:41,601 --> 01:25:44,203
And now let us,

1729
01:25:44,204 --> 01:25:47,206
if we're all ready,
begin competition

1730
01:25:47,207 --> 01:25:50,777
for Sue the Tyrannosaurus rex.

1731
01:25:50,778 --> 01:25:53,779
And I begin with a bid
of $500,000.

1732
01:25:53,780 --> 01:25:55,314
Now bidding at $500,000.

1733
01:25:55,315 --> 01:25:56,983
Now bidding at 500...
$600,000

1734
01:25:56,984 --> 01:25:59,986
$700,000. Now at seven,
at $700,000.

1735
01:25:59,987 --> 01:26:01,888
Now bidding's to $800,000.
Now bidding eight.

1736
01:26:01,889 --> 01:26:03,622
$900,000.
Now bidding at nine.

1737
01:26:03,623 --> 01:26:05,791
At $900,000,
Now bidding at nine.

1738
01:26:05,792 --> 01:26:07,693
At $900,000 now.

1739
01:26:07,694 --> 01:26:09,394
Two bids at $1 million,

1740
01:26:09,395 --> 01:26:10,897
one in the center,
one in the back.

1741
01:26:10,898 --> 01:26:12,398
It's in the center halfway up.

1742
01:26:12,399 --> 01:26:14,039
At $1 million.
Now bidding at one million.

1743
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:16,469
<i>At $1 million.
Now bidding at $1 million.</i>

1744
01:26:16,470 --> 01:26:18,606
<i>Now 1.1 million.
1.1 on...</i>

1745
01:26:19,344 --> 01:26:20,766
<i>...on the telephone
up here.</i>

1746
01:26:20,767 --> 01:26:23,509
At 7.4.

1747
01:26:23,510 --> 01:26:25,911
At 7.4.

1748
01:26:25,912 --> 01:26:28,848
Is there any advance
over 7.4?

1749
01:26:28,849 --> 01:26:31,283
$7,400,000

1750
01:26:31,284 --> 01:26:33,885
on the telephone up front then.

1751
01:26:33,886 --> 01:26:36,555
$7,400,000 then.

1752
01:26:36,556 --> 01:26:37,556
Fair warning.

1753
01:26:38,024 --> 01:26:39,659
- 7 million...
-<i> 7.5.</i>

1754
01:26:48,269 --> 01:26:49,269
$7,500,000.

1755
01:26:52,038 --> 01:26:54,741
$7,600,000.

1756
01:26:54,742 --> 01:26:57,477
<i>Aw, man.</i>

1757
01:26:57,478 --> 01:26:58,778
7 million, six.

1758
01:26:58,779 --> 01:27:00,746
$7,600,000.

1759
01:27:00,747 --> 01:27:02,348
Fair warning then

1760
01:27:02,349 --> 01:27:05,920
at $7,600,000 up here.

1761
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:09,926
7.6...

1762
01:27:13,926 --> 01:27:15,661
<i>Once the bidding was done,</i>

1763
01:27:15,662 --> 01:27:17,063
<i>you didn't know
immediately who it was.</i>

1764
01:27:17,064 --> 01:27:18,664
Everybody's looking
around, saying, okay,

1765
01:27:18,665 --> 01:27:19,860
who's going to come forward?

1766
01:27:19,861 --> 01:27:22,669
The bidding was exciting
despite the fact

1767
01:27:22,670 --> 01:27:24,805
that I was horrified
that it was happening.

1768
01:27:25,005 --> 01:27:28,508
Raised my paddle twice,
and then I was out of it.

1769
01:27:28,509 --> 01:27:30,376
There it went. Pssh.

1770
01:27:30,377 --> 01:27:31,778
Completely shocking

1771
01:27:31,779 --> 01:27:35,581
Sue sold that fast and the
price went that high.

1772
01:27:35,582 --> 01:27:37,416
I wasn't shocked
that it went that high.

1773
01:27:37,417 --> 01:27:39,585
I think it's worth
more than that.

1774
01:27:39,586 --> 01:27:42,755
It's the most by far any
fossil had ever sold for,

1775
01:27:42,756 --> 01:27:45,692
and although I'm sad, I'm
very sad we couldn't get it,

1776
01:27:45,693 --> 01:27:47,827
I'm thinking, okay,

1777
01:27:47,828 --> 01:27:50,462
this, this is a statement

1778
01:27:50,463 --> 01:27:52,564
about Black Hills
Institute and the people.

1779
01:27:52,565 --> 01:27:54,934
"You guys did
a good job."

1780
01:27:54,935 --> 01:27:56,469
...your new home

1781
01:27:56,470 --> 01:27:58,036
on the shores of Lake Michigan.

1782
01:27:58,037 --> 01:28:00,372
That is of course in Chicago

1783
01:28:00,373 --> 01:28:02,847
at the renowned Field Museum
of Natural History.

1784
01:28:03,877 --> 01:28:05,772
<i>Sue's bones
went on the auction block</i>

1785
01:28:05,972 --> 01:28:07,746
<i>at Sotheby's auction house
in New York.</i>

1786
01:28:07,747 --> 01:28:09,749
<i>Bidding started at 500,000</i>

1787
01:28:09,750 --> 01:28:11,066
<i>and ended at 7.6 million,</i>

1788
01:28:12,019 --> 01:28:13,752
<i>but totaled 8.4 million</i>

1789
01:28:13,753 --> 01:28:15,888
<i>after a fee
to the auction house.</i>

1790
01:28:15,889 --> 01:28:18,590
<i>McDonald's and the Walt Disney
Company helped foot the bill,</i>

1791
01:28:18,591 --> 01:28:21,760
<i>and the Field Museum of Natural
History reaps the benefits.</i>

1792
01:28:21,761 --> 01:28:24,183
<i>South Dakotans say she
should have stayed here.</i>

1793
01:28:43,583 --> 01:28:46,152
<i>Maurice Williams was
there in the building,</i>

1794
01:28:46,153 --> 01:28:48,920
<i>and I glanced up
at him, this man,</i>

1795
01:28:48,921 --> 01:28:50,857
<i>supported by our government</i>

1796
01:28:50,858 --> 01:28:53,626
<i>in receiving seven-point-whatever-it-was
million dollars,</i>

1797
01:28:53,627 --> 01:28:55,928
but that fossil

1798
01:28:55,929 --> 01:28:58,930
should have stayed
in her hometown museum.

1799
01:28:58,931 --> 01:29:01,099
If she wasn't going
to be in Black Hills

1800
01:29:01,100 --> 01:29:02,801
where she morally should be,

1801
01:29:02,802 --> 01:29:04,170
Field Museum was a good place.

1802
01:29:04,171 --> 01:29:07,172
<i>This was just the kind of place</i>

1803
01:29:07,173 --> 01:29:10,542
that we felt Sue had to go to.

1804
01:29:10,543 --> 01:29:13,545
<i>My reaction was relief
that that specimen</i>

1805
01:29:13,546 --> 01:29:15,947
wound up where the public and
the scientific community

1806
01:29:15,948 --> 01:29:17,517
will have access to it.

1807
01:29:17,518 --> 01:29:18,818
I think it's, you know, probably

1808
01:29:18,819 --> 01:29:20,620
the second-best place
she could have been.

1809
01:29:20,621 --> 01:29:22,822
It's going to go where millions
of people would see her.

1810
01:29:22,823 --> 01:29:24,823
She's not going to be
in prison anymore.

1811
01:29:24,824 --> 01:29:26,091
Sue is free,

1812
01:29:26,092 --> 01:29:27,827
and people can see her,

1813
01:29:27,828 --> 01:29:30,729
and they can get the same
excitement that I have for her,

1814
01:29:30,730 --> 01:29:32,625
and they can love her
just like I do.

1815
01:29:47,213 --> 01:29:48,547
<i>To me, that dinosaur</i>

1816
01:29:48,548 --> 01:29:49,948
<i>still belongs in Hill City.</i>

1817
01:29:49,949 --> 01:29:51,884
<i>Pete's the kind of guy
that can go out</i>

1818
01:29:51,885 --> 01:29:53,051
<i>and then find, you know,</i>

1819
01:29:53,052 --> 01:29:54,453
<i>another half a dozen
T. rexes,</i>

1820
01:29:54,454 --> 01:29:56,054
but there was only one Sue.

1821
01:29:56,055 --> 01:29:57,823
In your lifetime, you don't hope

1822
01:29:57,824 --> 01:29:59,125
to find something that good,

1823
01:29:59,126 --> 01:30:00,725
but we did,

1824
01:30:00,726 --> 01:30:02,962
and it's still
unbelievable to me.

1825
01:30:16,056 --> 01:30:18,109
<i>It was time for Sue's
unveiling finally,</i>

1826
01:30:18,110 --> 01:30:20,078
<i>which, of course,
you can imagine,</i>

1827
01:30:20,079 --> 01:30:22,982
Pete's most exciting moment,

1828
01:30:22,983 --> 01:30:25,684
to be able to be
reunited with Sue.

1829
01:30:25,685 --> 01:30:27,761
He wasn't invited.

1830
01:30:34,761 --> 01:30:36,528
<i>Six, five,</i>

1831
01:30:36,529 --> 01:30:37,897
<i>four, three,</i>

1832
01:30:37,898 --> 01:30:39,699
<i>two, one!</i>

1833
01:30:47,573 --> 01:30:50,242
<i>We go through what happened</i>

1834
01:30:50,243 --> 01:30:52,111
<i>and the negative of that,</i>

1835
01:30:52,112 --> 01:30:54,514
<i>but there's another negative.</i>

1836
01:30:54,515 --> 01:30:56,581
It's the negative
of what never happened

1837
01:30:56,582 --> 01:30:57,983
and what could have happened,

1838
01:30:57,984 --> 01:31:00,519
and it's a damn shame.

1839
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:02,889
Chicago has a wonderful dinosaur.
They love it,

1840
01:31:02,890 --> 01:31:04,857
but they don't love it
the way South Dakotans

1841
01:31:04,858 --> 01:31:06,993
would have loved that dinosaur.
