1
00:00:04,772 --> 00:00:07,541
( classical score playing )

2
00:02:08,896 --> 00:02:11,265
( heart monitor beeping )

3
00:02:16,036 --> 00:02:18,206
( respirator hissing )

4
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:53,707
Man:
YOU KNOW,
SHE HAD THAT SAME LOOK

5
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:55,743
OF AGONY ON HER FACE,

6
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:57,044
JUST LIKE MOTHER.

7
00:02:57,144 --> 00:02:59,680
THE SAME ONE
MOTHER HAD, YOU KNOW?

8
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,815
- Woman: YEAH.
- Man: YOU BORE
WITNESS TO IT.

9
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:03,951
EXCRUCIATING,

10
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:06,287
AWFUL WAITING.

11
00:03:06,387 --> 00:03:08,389
SHE WAS
STRUGGLING TO DIE.

12
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:11,492
YEAH, WELL,
IT'S NOT LIVING,
YOU KNOW.

13
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:15,229
- Woman: NO.
- IT'S NOT BEING ALIVE.

14
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:17,965
YOU KNOW, THEY STARTED DOING
THIS IN EUROPE ALREADY,

15
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:20,634
BUT NOT HERE.

16
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:22,436
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

17
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:25,906
- HOLLAND.
- HOLLAND.

18
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:27,441
NEVER HERE.

19
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,843
WAY TOO PURITANICAL HERE.

20
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:33,347
I DON'T KNOW WHY I DIDN'T
THINK OF THIS SOONER.

21
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:35,383
I WAS LIMITING MYSELF.

22
00:03:35,483 --> 00:03:37,618
IT'LL BE YOUR OWN FIELD
OF SPECIALTY, JACK.

23
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:40,754
YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOME
BUSINESS CARDS, YOU KNOW?

24
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:55,503
WE'LL BE SWINGING
SINGLES AGAIN,

25
00:03:55,603 --> 00:03:57,705
JUST LIKE WHEN
WE WERE IN OUR PRIME.

26
00:03:57,805 --> 00:04:00,007
REMEMBER THOSE TWO NURSES
WE WERE DATING?

27
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:02,710
TWO NURSES?

28
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,713
OH, THAT WAS ME,
NOT YOU. SCRATCH THAT.

29
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:07,715
YOU KNOW, YOU COULD
GRAB A BOX, JACK.

30
00:04:07,815 --> 00:04:09,483
- IT WOULDN'T HURT YOU.
- WELL, I'LL GET THE DOOR

31
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,753
THEN I'LL--
I'LL COME BACK OUT.

32
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:15,088
YEAH, THE BEST THING ABOUT
LIVING IN MY STORAGE ROOM--

33
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,157
( sniffs )
AIN'T BAD--

34
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,759
IT'S A SHORT COMMUTE.

35
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:20,528
( sniffs )
AIN'T BAD.

36
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,902
- ( engine stops )
- ( car door opens )

37
00:04:41,415 --> 00:04:42,783
YOU LEFT
YOUR VARSITY JACKET,

38
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:45,419
YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S AFGHAN
AND YOUR NOSE HAIR CLIPPERS.

39
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:48,055
THAT'S THE LAST
TIME I'M CLEANING UP
AFTER YOU, NEAL NICOL.

40
00:04:48,155 --> 00:04:50,290
HI, JACK.

41
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,096
- ( door opens, closes )
- I REMEMBER HER BEING MUCH
HAPPIER AT YOUR WEDDING.

42
00:04:56,196 --> 00:04:58,466
CUT.

43
00:04:58,566 --> 00:05:00,033
- ANTE UP.
- YES, DEAR.

44
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:03,036
- ( coins rattle )
- I'M IN.

45
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,406
OH, BY THE WAY,
NEAL, MAZEL TOV.

46
00:05:05,506 --> 00:05:07,608
YOU'RE GONNA BE
AN EX HERE SOON.
HOW'S IT FEEL?

47
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:10,878
LIKE LOSING 138 LBS
WITHOUT HAVING TO DIET.

48
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:12,513
( guys laugh )

49
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,450
OBITIATRY, STAN.
THE DOCTORING OF DEATH.

50
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,886
WHAT,
IN SUICIDE CLINICS?

51
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:21,154
REALLY? I'M A DOCTOR.
YOU WANT ME EXILED
TO BOCA RATON?

52
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:24,492
COME ON.
COME ON. PLANNED DEATH
IS GAINING ACCEPTANCE

53
00:05:24,592 --> 00:05:26,126
ALL OVER THE WORLD.
WHY NOT HERE?

54
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:28,128
CAN WE, FOR CHRIST'S SAKES,
JUST PLAY CARDS, PLEASE?

55
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:30,764
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T
PUT THOSE DECISIONS
IN THE HANDS OF PATIENTS.

56
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:32,566
WELL, WHOSE HANDS ARE
WE GONNA PUT 'EM IN?

57
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,234
DOCTORING'S
A HEALING PROFESSION.
I CAN'T EVEN--

58
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,103
DOCTORING'S
A DEATH PROFESSION TOO.

59
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:38,506
MEDICINE, MEDICIDE.

60
00:05:38,606 --> 00:05:40,874
- CARDS, STAN?
- UH, THREE.

61
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:43,644
THAT'S 10 IN A ROW.
THAT'S 10 IN A ROW HE FOLDS.

62
00:05:43,744 --> 00:05:45,779
YOU KNOW YOU'RE ALLOWED
TO BLUFF ONCE IN A WHILE.

63
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:49,149
- I DON'T BLUFF.
- THE GUY IS A STUDY
IN PURE NON-FICTION.

64
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:51,084
- LET HIM ALONE.
- YEAH.

65
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:54,922
YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU, JACK,
BUT MOST OF YOUR COLLEAGUES
THINK YOU'RE A NUT.

66
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:57,257
REMEMBER THEY
USED TO CALL YOU
THE "SCREWBALL PATHOLOGIST"?

67
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,193
WOULD YOU SAVE ME
THE SCHPILKES AND STAY
RETIRED FOR CRYING OUT LOUD?

68
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:01,862
I'M NOT RETIRED.

69
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:04,331
RETIRED MEANS ONE
IS NO LONGER OCCUPIED

70
00:06:04,432 --> 00:06:05,733
WITH ONE'S PROFESSION.

71
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:09,136
I MAY BE UNEMPLOYED,
BUT I AM OCCUPIED.

72
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:11,905
- Stan: EIGHT.
- KING HIGH. IT'S YOURS.

73
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:16,710
- AND IT'S YOUR DEAL.
- I KNOW IT.

74
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,279
- WHAT?
- MY-- MY HANDS ARE GREASY.

75
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:23,216
- WITH WHAT?
- I HAVE PIZZA FINGERS.

76
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:25,152
- PIZZA FINGERS?
- YOU EVER HEAR OF THEM?

77
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:27,988
Woman on TV:
At the Oak Hill Care Center
in Farmington Hills

78
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:30,924
where David Rivlin,
a 38-year old quadriplegic

79
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:33,360
who's been confined here
for three years,

80
00:06:33,461 --> 00:06:35,763
has asked to be taken off
of life support.

81
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:38,899
The Michigan courts have yet
to make a decision.

82
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:42,503
Mr. Rivlin, who sustained
a spinal cord injury

83
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:45,238
during a body-surfing accident
almost 20 years ago,

84
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:47,340
tried desperately
to live on his own

85
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:50,878
until the cost
of live-in aides
became too much for him.

86
00:06:50,978 --> 00:06:52,613
The state would
only offer Rivlin--

87
00:06:52,713 --> 00:06:55,148
- ( cartoon music playing )
- ( screeches )

88
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:01,522
( phone ringing )

89
00:07:07,995 --> 00:07:10,197
- Yeah?
- Woman: Turn on channel 7.

90
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:12,265
NO, I'M--
I'M WATCHING SYLVESTER.

91
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:14,434
- Hurry up.
- IT'S THE ONE WHERE
HE CHASES THE FROG.

92
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:17,004
- Do it now.
- WHY?

93
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:21,441
YOU SEE THIS MAN?
HE'S BEING KEPT ALIVE
AGAINST HIS WISHES.

94
00:07:23,611 --> 00:07:26,213
Jack:
OH, YEAH.
OH, MARGO.

95
00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:29,182
- MARGO.
- YEAH?

96
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:32,586
LOOK WHAT WE GOT HERE.

97
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:34,555
A VERITABLE GOLD MINE.
HERE, LOOK.

98
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,123
- ( clatters )
- OH, EXCUSE ME.
I'M SORRY.

99
00:07:36,223 --> 00:07:39,727
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
- IT'S A VERITABLE PLETHORA.

100
00:07:39,827 --> 00:07:42,496
- LOOK AT ALL THIS STUFF.
- Woman: YEAH, IT'S REAL METAL.

101
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:44,832
- THESE THINGS TOO?
- MARGO.

102
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:46,399
WHAT DOES THIS HAVE
TO DO WITH MR. RIVLIN?

103
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,935
- WHAT IS THAT?
ALL RIGHT.
- OKAY?

104
00:07:48,035 --> 00:07:49,603
- THAT'S A MOTOR.
- Margo: WHATEVER.

105
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:51,204
- WHAT ELSE?
- I THINK--

106
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:54,407
- YOU WANT THOSE BOLTS?
- LET'S TAKE THE WHOLE SHEBANG.

107
00:07:54,508 --> 00:07:58,311
- OKAY. OKAY, IS THIS IT?
- I'LL GIVE YOU THE WHOLE
THING FOR $15.

108
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:00,981
UH-HUH.
HOW'S ABOUT $10?

109
00:08:06,654 --> 00:08:10,558
YOU KNOW, THIS IS
WHAT YOU DO IT FOR,

110
00:08:10,658 --> 00:08:14,695
TO BE ABLE
TO PUT YOUR STAMP
ON MEDICAL HISTORY.

111
00:08:14,795 --> 00:08:17,397
A WORD TO THE WISE:
BE CAREFUL WHERE
YOU'RE STAMPING.

112
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,000
THAT SHIT'LL KILL YOU.

113
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,002
( hands clasp )

114
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:23,470
THANKS, NEAL.

115
00:08:23,571 --> 00:08:31,378
* I'LL BE HOME
FOR CHRISTMAS... *

116
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:33,313
"GROUNDBREAKING."

117
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:35,282
"TODAY WE HAVE SOME--

118
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:37,117
WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE TODAY

119
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:39,086
IS GROUNDBREAKING.

120
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:41,955
IT WILL-- IT'S GR--"

121
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:44,191
YOU KNOW A BETTER WORD
FOR "GROUNDBREAKING"?

122
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:46,059
WHY DON'T YOU TRY
TO RELAX, JACK?

123
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:50,698
I MEAN, HE ASKED
TO SEE YOU, SO YOU COULD
MAKE HIM UNDERSTAND.

124
00:08:50,798 --> 00:08:53,601
- OH, FOR GOD'S SAKES.
- IT'S JUST A DEMONSTRATION.

125
00:08:53,701 --> 00:08:55,903
SO I SHOULD GO IN THERE
AND NOT SAY ANYTHING, BABY?

126
00:08:56,003 --> 00:08:57,738
- IS THAT BETTER?
- I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

127
00:08:57,838 --> 00:08:59,940
JUST STAND THERE,
LOOK AT HIM AND DO
A MIME SHOW?

128
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,443
HE WANTS TO UNDERSTAND
HOW YOU'RE GOING

129
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,446
- TO HELP HIM END HIS LIFE.
- I KNOW WHY WE'RE GOING
TO SEE HIM, MARGO.

130
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,449
I'M ASKING IF
YOU KNOW ANOTHER WORD
FOR "GROUNDBREAKING."

131
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,319
- ( dings )
- SO I'M HEARING
DIFFERENT THINGS.

132
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:14,387
I HAVE A SOURCE THAT SAYS
THE OAKLAND COUNTY PROSECUTOR

133
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:16,523
- IS GONNA INTERVENE.
- Woman: SERIOUSLY,
MR. LESSENBERRY,

134
00:09:16,624 --> 00:09:18,826
THEY DO NOT PAY ME
NEARLY ENOUGH MONEY

135
00:09:18,926 --> 00:09:20,828
TO COMMENT
ON LOCAL POLITICS.

136
00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:22,796
I UNDERSTAND THAT.
I'M NOT ASKING YOU
TO COMMENT ON POLITICS.

137
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,598
I'M ASKING YOU IF YOU'VE
HAD ANY COMMUNICATION

138
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:27,735
WITH THE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE.

139
00:09:27,835 --> 00:09:30,337
Woman:
WE ARE A HOSPITAL.
WE PROVIDE MEDICAL CARE.

140
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:32,405
( heart monitor
beeping slowly )

141
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:34,574
Jack:
MY MERCITRON MACHINE, DAVID.

142
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:37,778
I BUILT IT
JUST FOR YOU.

143
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:44,084
YOU SEE...

144
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:47,487
WE HAVE A MONUMENTAL
OPPORTUNITY HERE, DAVID,

145
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,890
TO NOT ONLY...

146
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:53,093
END YOUR OWN SUFFERING

147
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:55,595
BUT TO GIVE
YOUR DEATH A MEANING.

148
00:09:55,696 --> 00:09:57,665
BY PROVIDING YOUR ORGANS

149
00:09:57,765 --> 00:09:59,867
TO MORE USEFUL CITIZENS,

150
00:09:59,967 --> 00:10:02,235
YOU WILL BE
BENEFITTING SOCIETY...

151
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:04,371
IMMEASURABLY.

152
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:06,707
JUST SO YOU KNOW,

153
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:08,776
WE'RE GONNA OFFER THEM UP

154
00:10:08,876 --> 00:10:12,312
ON A FIRST-COME-
FIRST-SERVE BASIS.

155
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:14,782
( clears throat )

156
00:10:14,882 --> 00:10:16,850
NOW...

157
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,252
I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU KNOW THIS,

158
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:22,355
BUT I CANNOT GIVE YOU
THE INJECTION MYSELF.

159
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,691
IT'S ILLEGAL.

160
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:27,027
BUT YOU CAN RELEASE
THESE SOLUTIONS

161
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:30,363
ON YOUR OWN.

162
00:10:31,765 --> 00:10:34,634
THE SALINE DRIP IS GONNA

163
00:10:34,735 --> 00:10:37,504
ACTIVATE THE THIOPENTAL.

164
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:39,572
THIS IS GONNA
PUT YOU TO SLEEP

165
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:41,942
AND SET OFF THIS TIMER.

166
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:47,214
YOU'LL FALL
INTO A DEEP COMA

167
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:51,284
AS THE LETHAL DOSE
OF POTASSIUM CHLORIDE

168
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:53,653
STOPS YOUR HEART.

169
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:58,058
UH, I KNOW YOU HAVE
NO MOTOR SKILLS,

170
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,227
SO I ADDED THIS.

171
00:11:03,697 --> 00:11:05,966
YOU CAN MOVE YOU HEAD
SLIGHTLY SIDE TO SIDE.

172
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:08,435
DON'T DO IT NOW,
BUT I'M GONNA PLACE THIS

173
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:10,203
BETWEEN YOUR TEETH.

174
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:14,041
PUT IT IN
AND MOVE YOUR HEAD.

175
00:11:14,141 --> 00:11:17,077
VERY SIMPLE--
MOVE YOUR HEAD SIDE TO SIDE

176
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:19,780
JUST A LITTLE BIT
AND IT GOES.

177
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,583
- ( beeping faster )
- THE TIME COMES, YOU JUST LET
YOUR TEETH DO ALL THE WORK.

178
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,553
- ( alarm beeping )
- THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS.

179
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:28,756
- Jack: NO IT'S NOT.
- GET THAT THING OUT
OF HERE NOW.

180
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:30,590
- HE'S JUST RECEIVING
NEW INFORMATION...
- JACK.

181
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:34,227
...SO HE'S BOUND TO REACT.
JUST GIVE HIM A CHANCE
TO CALM HIMSELF.

182
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:36,229
COULD YOU JUST GIVE HIM
A CHANCE TO CALM HIMSELF?

183
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:38,631
PLEASE LEAVE IMMEDIATELY
OF I'LL CALL SECURITY

184
00:11:38,732 --> 00:11:40,267
AND HAVE YOU THROWN OUT.

185
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,870
- PLEASE LEAVE.
- I'M SORRY, DAVID.

186
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:45,238
I DON'T NEED
YOUR SECURITY.

187
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:47,775
- CERTAINLY DON'T NEED THAT.
- GET IT OUT OF HERE.

188
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,642
DAVID, I'M SORRY
FOR THIS UPSET.

189
00:11:49,743 --> 00:11:51,378
Man:
DOCTOR, PLEASE.

190
00:11:51,478 --> 00:11:54,247
- I'M SORRY.
- Man: AND TAKE
THAT THING WITH YOU.

191
00:12:01,822 --> 00:12:03,891
Lessenberry:
IT TOOK A COUPLE MORE MONTHS,

192
00:12:03,991 --> 00:12:06,894
BUT THE DOCTORS
FINALLY DID ALLOW HIM TO BE
TAKEN OFF OF LIFE SUPPORT.

193
00:12:06,994 --> 00:12:08,595
AND WHAT
A BRUTAL WAY HE WENT.

194
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:11,431
- BRUTAL?
- BRUTAL.
THINK ABOUT IT.

195
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:14,101
IS IT REALLY ANY DIFFERENT
THAN WHAT THE GERMANS DID

196
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:16,770
- IN NAZI GERMANY?
- WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA.

197
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,271
- HMM?
- DO YOU WANT ME
TO PRINT THAT?

198
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:21,108
- PRINT WHAT YOU WANT.
- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOSPITALS,

199
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,310
- NOT NAZIS.
- WELL, THEY DO
THE SAME THING--

200
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,578
STARVING PEOPLE TO DEATH.
THEY CUT OFF THEIR FEEDING

201
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:27,547
AND THEIR WATER
AND THEY LET THEM DIE.

202
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:29,316
AND IT'S ALL LEGAL.

203
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,019
THE UNITED STATES
SUPREME COURT HAS VALIDATED

204
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:33,921
THE NAZI METHOD
OF EXECUTION.

205
00:12:34,021 --> 00:12:36,189
( Lessenberry laughs )
EXCUSE ME.

206
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:39,259
YOU-- YOU OBVIOUSLY
DON'T APPROVE OF THE
CURRENT METHOD.

207
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:40,760
NO, I DON'T.
DO YOU?

208
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:43,563
STARVING PEOPLE TO DEATH?
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

209
00:12:43,663 --> 00:12:45,732
IT'S INHUMANE.

210
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,835
IF A PERSON'S
ALLOWED TO DIE,

211
00:12:47,935 --> 00:12:50,670
THEN YOU INJECT THEM--
PAINLESSLY, QUICKLY.

212
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,605
YOU DON'T LET THEM
WITHER AWAY.

213
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:54,507
IT'S INCONCEIVABLE.

214
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,143
IT'S UNSPEAKABLE.

215
00:12:56,243 --> 00:12:59,947
WHAT WOULD YOU CHARGE
FOR THIS PROCEDURE?

216
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:04,784
YOU DON'T CHARGE PEOPLE

217
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:06,920
FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS,
MR. LESSENBERRY.

218
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,488
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

219
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:13,827
YOU-- YOU'VE REALLY GOT
SOME STORY HERE, DOC.

220
00:13:13,927 --> 00:13:16,463
DON'T BE SURPRISED IF THIS
GETS PICKED UP NATIONALLY.
( chuckles )

221
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:18,598
IS YOUR TURKEY OKAY?

222
00:13:18,698 --> 00:13:21,368
I DON'T LIKE FAT.

223
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:23,837
( knocks on door )

224
00:13:30,277 --> 00:13:32,412
SELFISH BASTARD.

225
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:35,115
YOU HOG ALL THE INK
IN THE DETROIT PAPERS,

226
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:37,617
NOW YOU'RE IN "NEWSWEEK"

227
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:39,619
AND THERE'S
NOTHING ABOUT ME.

228
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:40,921
- OH.
- WHAT ABOUT ME?

229
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:43,456
LOOK AT THIS. MAN.

230
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:46,359
"BLUNT AND FEISTY,
HE'S THE FIRST AMERICAN DOCTOR

231
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:48,862
TO ADVOCATE
PHYSICIAN-ASSISTED SUICIDE."

232
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:50,898
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO
TAKE ME SERIOUSLY NOW.

233
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:53,266
- YOU'RE NOT A LOCAL
QUACK ANYMORE.
- NO NO.

234
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:55,768
- YOU'RE AMERICA'S QUACK.
- AMERICA'S QUACK!

235
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:57,470
- ( laughs )
- LOOK AT THIS.

236
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,639
YOU EARNED IT.

237
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:01,875
CONGRATULATIONS.

238
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:05,278
- NEAL, CONGRATULATIONS.
- "NEWSWEEK" MAGAZINE.

239
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:08,015
SO HOW ARE
WE GONNA CELEBRATE?

240
00:14:08,115 --> 00:14:11,018
UH, YOU WANT
A GLASS OF WATER?

241
00:14:11,118 --> 00:14:15,022
- YEAH, THAT'D BE GREAT.
- GREAT!

242
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,038
Jack:
SO WHEN WERE YOU
FIRST DIAGNOSED

243
00:14:31,138 --> 00:14:32,872
WITH ALZHEIMER'S,
MRS. ADKINS?

244
00:14:32,973 --> 00:14:35,508
Mrs. Adkins:
ABOUT A YEAR AGO
I THINK.

245
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:39,012
IT WAS
THREE YEARS AGO NOW.

246
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:42,916
OH. AND WHAT DID
YOUR DOCTOR SAY

247
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:45,885
- WHEN HE TOLD YOU?
- WELL, IT WAS LIKE A BOMB.

248
00:14:45,986 --> 00:14:48,688
HE SAID
SHE HAD ALZHEIMER'S

249
00:14:48,788 --> 00:14:51,724
AND IT'D COME TO A POINT

250
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:53,460
WHERE SHE WOULDN'T
BE ABLE TO...

251
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,995
( cries )

252
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:56,263
( exhales deeply )

253
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:58,298
- THERE IS--
- ...DRESS HERSELF.

254
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,467
SHE WOULDN'T BE ABLE
TO TAKE A BATH.

255
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:03,636
Jack:
WHAT-- WHAT ARE SOME
OF THE OTHER FEARS YOU HAVE?

256
00:15:06,173 --> 00:15:08,942
THAT I WOULDN'T KNOW
THAT THIS IS MY HUSBAND

257
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:12,712
AND MY CHILDREN,

258
00:15:12,812 --> 00:15:15,415
OR "WHO AM I?"

259
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:19,252
Jack:
YOU'RE SENSING
THE LOSS OF THINGS.

260
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:22,189
LOSS LOSS
LOSS LOSS LOSS.

261
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:25,058
SO LET'S TALK
ABOUT THAT IF YOU COULD.

262
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,829
WHAT HAPPENED TODAY,
FOR INSTANCE?

263
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,832
- WHAT HAPPENED TODAY?
- YOU TELL ME. I DON'T EVEN
KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TODAY.

264
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:36,636
SHE WENT OUT
INTO THE YARD AND THEN--

265
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:40,940
WHAT I COULD SEE WAS

266
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,110
SHE STOOD THERE
IN THE YARD

267
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:46,879
AND I COULD SEE
FROM BEHIND HER

268
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,916
THAT SHE DIDN'T KNOW
WHERE SHE WAS.

269
00:15:50,017 --> 00:15:52,185
SHE DIDN'T KNOW
TO TURN AROUND,

270
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,521
THAT WAS THE BACK DOOR
OF THE HOUSE.

271
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:58,291
SHE DIDN'T KNOW THAT
THAT WAS THE GATE TO
GO OUT TO THE STREET.

272
00:15:58,391 --> 00:16:00,793
SHE JUST--
SHE DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

273
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:02,795
Jack:
MM-HMM.

274
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:04,864
I DON'T REMEMBER.

275
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,200
Jack on TV:
When I talked
to your doctor--

276
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,002
first of all,
he would hardly
speak with me.

277
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:10,470
But when he did,

278
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,205
what your doctor was trying
to communicate to me

279
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:15,208
was that you're not
imminently terminal.

280
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:17,444
- Do you understand?
- Yes, I--I-- I understand.

281
00:16:17,544 --> 00:16:20,913
- and I understand--
- Margo: SHOULD I MAKE
SOME TEA FOR US?

282
00:16:21,014 --> 00:16:23,583
- JACK?
- That is frightening.

283
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:26,853
- JACK, DO YOU WANT SOME TEA?
- If I don't make this
decision right now,

284
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:29,189
I'll never be able to.

285
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:31,658
MARGO, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT WE'RE DOING.

286
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:33,626
LOOK AT HER.

287
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:35,628
LOOK AT HER.

288
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:39,166
SHE LOOKS WELL TO ME.

289
00:16:39,266 --> 00:16:43,103
SHE LOOKS
QUITE CAPABLE, NO?

290
00:16:43,203 --> 00:16:45,838
SHE'S NOT
THE RIGHT ONE.

291
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:47,974
BUT SHE HAS THE RIGHT.

292
00:16:48,075 --> 00:16:50,743
AS A PATIENT,

293
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,212
IT'S HER CHOICE.

294
00:16:52,312 --> 00:16:54,081
I refuse to die
a slow death.

295
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:56,516
Margo: COME ON, JACK.
YOU KNOW HOW THINGS ARE
GONNA BE PERCEIVED.

296
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:58,618
- I DON'T CARE.
- THE MEDIA'S GONNA
ALL OVER IT.

297
00:16:58,718 --> 00:17:01,020
- I KNOW.
- YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO TELL HER YES.

298
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:03,090
- I KNOW.
- YOU HAVE TO BE STRATEGIC.

299
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,857
MARGO, WHAT DO WE CARE
ABOUT THE MEDIA?

300
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:06,926
WHO CARES?

301
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,896
LOOK. SOMETIMES IN LIFE

302
00:17:09,996 --> 00:17:12,199
THERE ARE STRATEGIES
THAT YOU HAVE TO TAKE,

303
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:15,102
BECAUSE WE HAVE
TO BE VERY CAREFUL
ABOUT OUR PURPOSE.

304
00:17:15,202 --> 00:17:17,704
- OUR PURPOSE IS IMPORTANT.
- WELL, WHAT ABOUT HER?!

305
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:19,106
WHO CARES
WHAT PEOPLE THINK?

306
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:22,542
IT'S WHAT
MY PATIENT FEELS.

307
00:17:22,642 --> 00:17:26,113
SHE DOESN'T KNOW EACH DAY
WHAT SHE'S GONNA FIND

308
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:27,780
WHEN SHE LOOKS
IN THE MIRROR.

309
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,750
SHE DOESN'T KNOW
IF SHE'S GONNA SEE
HERSELF THERE ANYMORE.

310
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,719
THIS IS HER TERROR.

311
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:35,955
THIS IS WHAT
SHE GOES THROUGH,
DAY IN AND DAY OUT.

312
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:39,392
THE TERROR OF BEING...

313
00:17:41,428 --> 00:17:43,263
LOST.

314
00:17:45,432 --> 00:17:47,667
- JACK.
- SHE'S RUNNING
OUT OF TIME.

315
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:50,103
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

316
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,473
LOOK AT ME.

317
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:57,110
IF IT WAS ME,
IF I WAS HER,

318
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,979
IF I WAS
IN THE SAME SITUATION,
WOULD YOU DO IT?

319
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,681
- YOU, MARGO?
- YES, ME, MARGO.

320
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:03,550
- WOULD YOU DO IT FOR ME?
- OF COURSE I'D DO IT. YES.

321
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,385
- YOU WOULD DO IT?
YOU KNOW THAT?
- SURE.

322
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:09,122
IF I SAW THE SAME LOOK
OF DETERMINATION IN YOUR EYES

323
00:18:09,222 --> 00:18:12,058
AS I SAW IN HERS,
OF COURSE I'D DO IT.

324
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:14,327
NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.

325
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:17,230
MY OWN SISTER--
IN TRUTH, I'D DO IT.

326
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,998
- YOU'D DO IT?
- MM-HMM.

327
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,933
THAT'S YOUR ANSWER.

328
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:23,470
YEAH, I KNOW.

329
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:26,206
I JUST WANTED TO WORK
THIS THROUGH, YOU KNOW?

330
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:28,708
JUST GO THROUGH
THE VARIABLES.

331
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:31,511
- Mrs. Adkins: "Who am I?"
- Jack on TV: And you're
aware of your decision?

332
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:35,114
- Mrs. Adkins: Yes.
- LET 'EM COME AFTER ME.

333
00:18:35,215 --> 00:18:37,584
LET 'EM COME AFTER
A REAL PHYSICIAN.

334
00:18:37,684 --> 00:18:40,553
Mrs. Adkins:
...the end of my life.

335
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:44,056
I THINK I'M GONNA
MAKE US SOME TEA
RIGHT NOW.

336
00:18:44,157 --> 00:18:46,058
MAKE IT STRONG,
WILL YOU?

337
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:49,962
- Margo: YEAH.
- Jack on TV: ...the word
for "the end of life."

338
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:51,464
- Death.
- Margo: BY THE WAY...

339
00:18:51,564 --> 00:18:53,433
Jack on TV:
This is what you wish?

340
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:57,604
- Yes. Yes, I do.
- ...WHERE ARE WE GONNA
DO THIS?

341
00:18:57,704 --> 00:19:01,474
Woman:
SOME PEOPLE THINK
WE BREW UP POISONOUS POTIONS

342
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:03,210
LIKE WITCHES
FROM GALLOWS HILL.

343
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,245
OTHERS THINK IT'S
"TAKE TWO HEMLOCK PILLS

344
00:19:05,345 --> 00:19:07,113
AND MEET YOUR MAKER
IN THE MORNING."

345
00:19:07,214 --> 00:19:08,448
WELL, SURPRISE SURPRISE--

346
00:19:08,548 --> 00:19:11,083
THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS A HEMLOCK PILL.

347
00:19:11,184 --> 00:19:14,954
WE OFFER ASSISTANCE

348
00:19:15,054 --> 00:19:16,389
AND ADVANCED DIRECTIVES,

349
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:18,791
D.N.R.s--
"DO NOT RESUSCITATE"--

350
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:20,593
WILLS, HOSPICE CARE,

351
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:23,830
BUT WE DO NOT
DISPENSE DRUGS,

352
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:25,565
WE DO NOT PULL PLUGS.

353
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:29,168
WE STARTED THIS CHAPTER
BECAUSE WE BELIEVE

354
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:32,405
THAT TO EACH PERSON,
THEIR OWN WAY OF DEATH...

355
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,074
WITH DIGNITY.

356
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,109
Jack:
OH, MISS GOOD,

357
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,678
I CAN CARRY
THAT FOR YOU.

358
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:41,314
THAT WOULD'VE BEEN NICE,
DR. KEVORKIAN,

359
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:43,350
BUT IT'S A LITTLE LATE NOW,
DON'T YOU THINK?

360
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:45,184
AND IT'S "MISSUS."

361
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:47,587
- MISSUS?
- YUP.

362
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,322
OH. GOOD.

363
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:52,225
SO-- SO YOU KNOW
WHO I AM?

364
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:54,026
WHAT DO I LOOK LIKE,
JUNE CLEAVER?

365
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:55,862
WHAT CAN
I DO FOR YOU?

366
00:19:55,962 --> 00:19:58,197
WELL, UH...

367
00:19:58,298 --> 00:20:00,199
I, UMM--

368
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,801
I HAVE
MY FIRST PATIENT,

369
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:05,238
- BUT WHAT I DON'T HAVE...
- IS A PLACE.

370
00:20:05,338 --> 00:20:09,276
- YES.
- AND YOU'D LIKE
TO USE MY HOME?

371
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:12,612
- ( engine starts )
- WELL, NO.

372
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,381
I THOUGHT
YOU WOULD KNOW A PLACE,

373
00:20:14,481 --> 00:20:17,317
BUT IF I COULD USE YOUR HOME,
THAT WOULD BE JUST FINE.

374
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:19,386
- SURE.
- WELL, IF YOU'RE
GONNA COME TO MY HOME,

375
00:20:19,486 --> 00:20:21,554
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
DRESS MORE CHEERFULLY.

376
00:20:28,094 --> 00:20:29,896
( clacks )

377
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:34,166
IF YOU'VE NEVER
ACTUALLY TESTED THAT BEFORE,

378
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:35,902
HOW DO YOU KNOW
IT'S GONNA WORK?

379
00:20:36,002 --> 00:20:38,471
BECAUSE I MADE IT.

380
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:41,240
I WISH
YOU HAD A STRONGER
ARGUMENT THAN THAT.

381
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:43,042
( chuckles )

382
00:20:43,142 --> 00:20:47,314
HEY, WHATEVER
I CAN DO TO LEND A HAND
TOMORROW, LET ME KNOW.

383
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:49,849
OH, ON THIS ONE, NEAL,

384
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:51,284
THIS FIRST ONE,

385
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:54,053
I WANT IT
TO BE ME AND MARGO.

386
00:20:54,153 --> 00:20:56,656
- JUST US.
- ( phone ringing )

387
00:21:03,062 --> 00:21:04,797
AM I HEARING A PHONE

388
00:21:04,897 --> 00:21:06,799
OR IS IT MY...?

389
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:12,972
I'VE GOTTA REMEMBER
TO INSTALL ONE BY THE COUCH.

390
00:21:13,072 --> 00:21:14,341
YOUR HOUSE.

391
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:17,744
DR. KEVORKIAN'S.
THIS IS DEBBY.

392
00:21:18,911 --> 00:21:20,179
OH, HANG ON,
MISS GOOD.

393
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,582
JANET GOOD.

394
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,553
- OOH, THERE WE GO.
- HEY, JANET.

395
00:21:26,653 --> 00:21:28,254
Janet:
I don't know how to say this,
so I'm just gonna say it.

396
00:21:28,355 --> 00:21:31,924
I'm sorry. I know
it's the last minute,

397
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:35,595
BUT MY HUSBAND RAY--
HE'S A RETIRED POLICE CAPTAIN

398
00:21:35,695 --> 00:21:37,930
AND HE FEELS
VERY STRONGLY

399
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,932
THAT WE CAN'T USE
OUR HOUSE.

400
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:41,601
- HE FEELS THAT
IT WOULD PUT US AT RISK.
- Jack: Are you kidding me?

401
00:21:41,701 --> 00:21:43,603
Lady, are you kidding me?

402
00:21:43,703 --> 00:21:45,672
I'VE GOT MARGO
AT THE AIRPORT

403
00:21:45,772 --> 00:21:47,640
PICKING THESE
PEOPLE UP AS WE SPEAK.

404
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,643
- You can't
do this to me.
- OH. YEAH, WELL,

405
00:21:50,743 --> 00:21:52,745
I COULD MAKE
SOME OTHER SUGGESTIONS.

406
00:21:52,845 --> 00:21:55,948
THERE'S NOTHING
FURTHER TO BE GAINED
BY TALKING TO YOU.

407
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,555
WHAT NOW?

408
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:07,860
CALL THE WHOLE THING OFF?

409
00:22:09,128 --> 00:22:11,831
- ( grunts )
- ALTHOUGH...

410
00:22:11,931 --> 00:22:13,366
( phone clicks )

411
00:22:13,466 --> 00:22:15,635
( insects buzzing )

412
00:22:25,211 --> 00:22:26,946
OKAY.

413
00:22:32,652 --> 00:22:35,321
I HOPE SHE LIKE PARKS
AND VOLKSWAGENS.

414
00:22:35,422 --> 00:22:37,590
( sighs )

415
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,726
Mr. Adkins:
JACK'S MADE ALL
THE ARRANGEMENTS

416
00:22:39,826 --> 00:22:42,395
Mrs. Adkins:
MM-HMM. GOOD.

417
00:22:42,495 --> 00:22:44,597
MARGO'S GOING TO

418
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:47,634
TAKE ME
TO THE AIRPORT SHORTLY.

419
00:22:49,268 --> 00:22:51,504
IT'S BEST FOR ME
TO GO HOME,

420
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:57,710
SHOULD ANYTHING HAPPEN
WITH THE POLICE LATER ON.

421
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,846
YES.

422
00:23:46,526 --> 00:23:48,695
Jack: OKAY.

423
00:23:53,132 --> 00:23:54,634
( beeping )

424
00:23:54,734 --> 00:23:57,203
Mrs. Adkins:
OUR GARDENER COMES
ON THURSDAY.

425
00:23:59,238 --> 00:24:01,674
HE'S GOING
TO PLANT MARIGOLDS.

426
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:07,747
MARIGOLDS PROTECT
THE GARDEN.

427
00:24:10,983 --> 00:24:13,653
IT'S NOT TOO LATE,
MY DEAR. YOU KNOW?

428
00:24:13,753 --> 00:24:16,222
WE CAN STOP RIGHT NOW.

429
00:24:16,322 --> 00:24:19,125
YOU WOULDN'T OFFEND ME.

430
00:24:20,493 --> 00:24:23,563
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
YOU WOULDN'T OFFEND ME.

431
00:24:31,904 --> 00:24:34,707
TELL ME WHEN
TO FLIP THE SWITCH.

432
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,489
- WHENEVER YOU'RE--
- ( clicks )

433
00:25:08,374 --> 00:25:10,042
Mrs. Adkins: MMM.

434
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:18,885
THANK YOU.

435
00:25:19,952 --> 00:25:21,988
MMM.

436
00:25:32,498 --> 00:25:34,667
( flatlines )

437
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:55,354
Jack:
"WHEN A PATIENT
IN AGONY DIES,

438
00:25:55,454 --> 00:25:58,791
THEN A DOCTOR'S
TRUE CALLING IMPLIES

439
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:03,696
ONE SHOULD DO WHAT IS BEST,
AT THE PATIENT'S REQUEST,

440
00:26:03,796 --> 00:26:07,900
FOR HUMANE, QUICK
AND PAINLESS DEMISE."

441
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,670
- ( camera clicking )
- ( police radio chatter )

442
00:26:23,716 --> 00:26:25,885
( siren blares )

443
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:28,788
( door opens )

444
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:38,297
I TOLD YOU
THEY COULDN'T KEEP ME.

445
00:26:38,397 --> 00:26:41,133
- Margo: COME IN, COME IN.
- THEY'VE GOT NOTHING
TO CHARGE ME ON.

446
00:26:41,233 --> 00:26:43,670
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.

447
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:46,472
Man:
HAS HE NO REGARD
FOR THE SANCTITY OF LIFE?

448
00:26:46,572 --> 00:26:48,941
HOW DARE
HE CALL HIMSELF A DOCTOR?

449
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:51,177
WHAT CAN WE CHARGE HIM WITH?
THE MEDICAL EXAMINER SAID

450
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:53,579
HE HAD NO CHOICE
BUT TO RULE IT A SUICIDE.

451
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,248
I JUST CAN'T STOP
THINKING ABOUT YESTERDAY,

452
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:58,751
HOW IT ALL WENT.

453
00:26:59,986 --> 00:27:02,554
I GUESS SOMEHOW
I JUST THOUGHT
THE WHOLE THING

454
00:27:02,655 --> 00:27:04,323
WOULD BE NICER.

455
00:27:04,423 --> 00:27:05,958
COULD BE NICER?

456
00:27:06,058 --> 00:27:08,227
- YEAH.
- HOW, "NICER"?

457
00:27:08,327 --> 00:27:11,630
DOES THIS LOOK
LIKE COMPASSION
TO YOU, DAVID?

458
00:27:11,731 --> 00:27:13,666
COMPASSION?

459
00:27:13,766 --> 00:27:18,738
HE KILLS A WOMAN
AND HE CALLS IT COMPASSION?

460
00:27:18,838 --> 00:27:22,474
- ( silverware clatters )
- Jack: IF THIS GUY THOMPSON
WANTS TO ARREST ME,

461
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:25,044
LET HIM ARREST ME.
I DON'T CARE.

462
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:27,113
I'M NOT A BUSY MAN,
YOU KNOW.

463
00:27:27,213 --> 00:27:29,816
Margo:
WE HAVE TO
GET YOU A LAWYER.

464
00:27:29,916 --> 00:27:32,184
- I DON'T WANT A LAWYER.
- ( sighs )

465
00:27:32,284 --> 00:27:35,321
JACK, THEY'RE THREATENING
TO BRING YOU UP ON
MURDER CHARGES.

466
00:27:35,421 --> 00:27:38,090
- YOU NEED A LAWYER.
- I DON'T KNOW ANY LAWYERS.

467
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:41,828
THERE'S THIS ONE GUY
I SEE ON TV ALL THE TIME.

468
00:27:41,928 --> 00:27:44,563
YOU'RE GONNA GET HIM.

469
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,733
HE DOES THESE

470
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:49,736
MEDICAL MALPRACTICE
COMMERCIALS.

471
00:27:49,836 --> 00:27:51,971
IS THAT A NEW WIG?

472
00:27:52,071 --> 00:27:53,773
YES.

473
00:27:53,873 --> 00:27:55,607
WHY? IT'S RUM RAISIN.

474
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:59,779
I THINK IT MAKES ME LOOK
A LITTLE MORE FETCHING.

475
00:28:01,247 --> 00:28:03,015
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

476
00:28:03,115 --> 00:28:04,416
IS THAT SILLY?

477
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,618
I DON'T KNOW.
I-- I DON'T KNOW.

478
00:28:06,719 --> 00:28:09,856
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WIGS,
BUT THAT'S JUST ME.

479
00:28:09,956 --> 00:28:12,091
ONE DAY, YOU KNOW,
I'M GOING TO TURN AROUND--

480
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:16,128
GIRLS, I DON'T THINK
THE GOOD DOCTOR
SWAYS TO FANCY.

481
00:28:16,228 --> 00:28:18,831
- HIDE THE PERRIER.
- ( giggles )

482
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:24,737
- THIS WAY.
- HOW GOOD CAN THIS GUY BE

483
00:28:24,837 --> 00:28:26,572
IF THERE'S
NO ELEVATORS?

484
00:28:26,672 --> 00:28:28,875
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING
ABOUT DICK THOMPSON.

485
00:28:28,975 --> 00:28:31,677
HE MAY BE
A CARD-CARRYING MEMBER
OF THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT,

486
00:28:31,778 --> 00:28:34,914
BUT HE DOESN'T
HAVE A POT TO PISS IN,
CHARGING JACK WITH MURDER.

487
00:28:35,014 --> 00:28:36,482
HE DIDN'T KILL ANYONE.

488
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:39,952
NULLUM CRIMEN,
NULLA POENA SINE LEGE.

489
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:43,189
- "NO CRIME..."
- "...NO PUNISHMENT
WITHOUT LAW."

490
00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:45,457
- Man: YEAH.
- THE MAN KNOWS
HIS LATIN.

491
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:48,895
( chuckles )
I ALSO KNOW McNALLY,
THE DISTRICT JUDGE,

492
00:28:48,995 --> 00:28:50,797
AND NO WAY
IN HELL IS HE GONNA
LET THIS MOVE FORWARD.

493
00:28:50,897 --> 00:28:52,999
BUT UNDERSTAND,
THESE EXTREMISTS WILL DO

494
00:28:53,099 --> 00:28:55,868
EVERYTHING UNDER
THE SUN TO STOP YOU
FROM DOING THIS AGAIN.

495
00:28:55,968 --> 00:28:57,536
THEY HAVE NO RECOURSE
TO STOP ME.

496
00:28:57,636 --> 00:29:01,673
DID YOU VIDEOTAPE
YOUR CONVERSATIONS
WITH JANET ADKINS?

497
00:29:01,774 --> 00:29:05,277
- YEAH.
- YES, I DID.

498
00:29:05,377 --> 00:29:06,913
- WHY?
- GOOD. GOOD.

499
00:29:07,013 --> 00:29:10,082
WELL, YOU SEE,
COURTROOMS ARE
THEATERS OF CONSCIENCE.

500
00:29:10,182 --> 00:29:13,319
IF WE SHOW YOUR PATIENTS
PLEADING FOR YOUR HELP,

501
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:16,823
IF WE LAY OUT
THE GUT-WRENCHING
EMOTIONS OF IT ALL,

502
00:29:16,923 --> 00:29:19,125
THAT'S YOUR
GOLDEN TICKET.

503
00:29:19,225 --> 00:29:22,528
NO JURY WILL CONVICT YOU
WITH ME AT YOUR SIDE.

504
00:29:22,628 --> 00:29:26,065
- I SIMPLY DO NOT LOSE.
( chuckles )
- ( chuckles )

505
00:29:26,165 --> 00:29:29,869
HE'S A WOLVERINE.
WOLVERINE.

506
00:29:29,969 --> 00:29:32,939
- WOW.
- YEAH, I WAS
A THEATER MAJOR.

507
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,842
I DID AN UNFORGETTABLE
GILES COREY

508
00:29:35,942 --> 00:29:37,643
IN "THE CRUCIBLE"
SENIOR YEAR.

509
00:29:37,743 --> 00:29:39,378
MY MOTHER STILL HAS
THE REVIEWS IN HER POCKET.

510
00:29:39,478 --> 00:29:41,380
- REALLY?
- Man: YEAH.

511
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,582
- I CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY YOU.
- Man: OH, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO PAY ME.

512
00:29:43,682 --> 00:29:45,184
I'LL DO IT FOR FREE.

513
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:47,686
LET THEM KEEP TRYING
TO PROVE THIS IS A CRIME,

514
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:50,256
AND WE'LL KEEP PROVING
IT'S A CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE.

515
00:29:51,991 --> 00:29:53,926
SO THAT DO YOU THINK?

516
00:29:54,026 --> 00:29:56,395
SHE'S A GOOD JUDGE
OF CHARACTER.

517
00:29:56,495 --> 00:29:58,064
THAT'S A WIG
SHE'S WEARING.

518
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:02,668
- OH.
- RUM RAISIN.

519
00:30:02,768 --> 00:30:06,472
- JACK. ( laughs )
- I LIKE IT.

520
00:30:06,572 --> 00:30:09,075
- THANK YOU.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

521
00:30:10,442 --> 00:30:12,511
Jack:
THE-- "THE MORNING DRIVE SHOW"?

522
00:30:12,611 --> 00:30:15,147
Lessenberry:
Yeah, he wanted me to ask you
if you'd come on as a guest.

523
00:30:15,247 --> 00:30:18,450
IT'S ON 6:00
TO 10:00 IN THE MORNING.
IT'S GOT A BIG AUDIENCE.

524
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,819
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE DRIVING
TO WORK LISTEN TO IT.

525
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:24,991
HE KEEPS IT PRETTY LIGHT.
MIGHT LET YOU PICK A RECORD.

526
00:30:25,091 --> 00:30:27,059
WELL, I NEVER HEARD OF IT,

527
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:28,928
BUT I'LL DO IT, SURE.

528
00:30:29,028 --> 00:30:32,698
* BLACK, WHITE, RED, BROWN,
FEEL THE VIBRATION...*

529
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:35,467
Man:
GOOD MORNING, EVERYBODY.
THIS IS "THE BOB BENDER SHOW,"

530
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:38,370
"THE MORNING DRIVE SHOW."
TODAY IT'S A SPECIAL EDITION--

531
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:42,875
IT'S "THE MORNING DIE SHOW,"
BECAUSE OF MY SPECIAL GUEST,
DR. JACK KEVORKIAN.

532
00:30:42,975 --> 00:30:45,011
HE'S A LOCAL BOY
FROM HERE IN "DE-TROIT."

533
00:30:45,111 --> 00:30:47,779
YOU MIGHT KNOW HIM BETTER
AS DR. DEATH.

534
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:51,217
I LIKE TO SAY
HE IS THE LAST DOCTOR
YOU WILL EVER NEED.

535
00:30:51,317 --> 00:30:54,353
I ACTUALLY HEARD
SOMEBODY REFER TO YOU AS
DR. FRANKENSTEIN THE OTHER DAY

536
00:30:54,453 --> 00:30:57,957
BECAUSE OF YOUR RATHER ACTIVE
ORGAN-PROCUREMENT PROGRAM.

537
00:30:58,057 --> 00:31:00,592
WELL, I'M GONNA TAKE THAT
AS A COMPLIMENT,

538
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:03,595
BECAUSE ANYONE WHO'S READ
THE STORY OF FRANKENSTEIN

539
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:07,799
KNOWS THAT HE WAS
A BENEVOLENT MAN

540
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:11,470
AND IT WAS SOCIETY
WHO MADE THE MONSTER BAD.

541
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:13,973
Bob:
WELL, I FIND IT
IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE,

542
00:31:14,073 --> 00:31:16,575
BUT OUR LINES
ARE LIGHTING UP
AND MY PRODUCER TELLS ME

543
00:31:16,675 --> 00:31:19,645
40% TO 50% OF OUR CALLERS
SAY "HEY, YOU'RE RIGHT."

544
00:31:19,745 --> 00:31:22,949
SO MAYBE I SHOULDN'T GO ON.
LET'S QUIT WHILE I'M AHEAD.

545
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:25,651
- WELL, DON'T DIE
ON ME NOW, DOC.
- NO NO NO.

546
00:31:25,751 --> 00:31:28,587
SORRY, I HAD TO SAY THAT.
TELL ME A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT YOUR MERCITRON,

547
00:31:28,687 --> 00:31:31,223
- SOMETHING I HOPE THE--
- SEE? HE'S DOING GOOD.

548
00:31:31,323 --> 00:31:34,760
- YEAH.
- SHARP AS A TACK.

549
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:38,664
Jack over radio:
It's good that people realize
what's at stake here.

550
00:31:38,764 --> 00:31:41,600
I MEAN,
SELF-DETERMINATION IS

551
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,702
A BASIC HUMAN RIGHT

552
00:31:43,802 --> 00:31:46,538
AND EVERYONE
SHOULD HAVE IT.

553
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:49,108
BY FLIPPING THE SWITCH
ON YOUR SUICIDE MACHINE,

554
00:31:49,208 --> 00:31:51,343
- KIND OF LIKE
HITTING THIS BUTTON HERE.
- ( button clicks )

555
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:55,982
WELL, SURE,
OR CARBON MONOXIDE,

556
00:31:56,082 --> 00:31:59,318
which actually is
a quicker procedure.

557
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:01,187
and I can assure you
as a pathologist

558
00:32:01,287 --> 00:32:04,856
GAS INHALATION
ALWAYS LEAVES THE DECEASED

559
00:32:04,957 --> 00:32:07,426
WITH A ROSY,
COLORFUL AFTERGLOW.

560
00:32:07,526 --> 00:32:09,728
Bob:
WELL, HOPEFULLY OUR
LISTENERS AREN'T LISTENING

561
00:32:09,828 --> 00:32:12,965
IN THEIR GARAGES THIS MORNING.
IF THEY ARE, OPEN THE DOOR.

562
00:32:13,065 --> 00:32:16,668
( evil laugh )
WE'RE GETTING
RATHER GHOULISH HERE

563
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:20,639
AT 7:55 IN THE MORNING.
YOU ARE LIVE WITH BOB BENDER

564
00:32:20,739 --> 00:32:22,474
AND I HESITATE
TO SAY "LIVE," DOCTOR,

565
00:32:22,574 --> 00:32:25,144
BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING
DEATH WITH DR. DEATH.

566
00:32:25,244 --> 00:32:28,047
AND IF YOU WANT TO END IT,
CALL DR. KEVORKIAN

567
00:32:28,147 --> 00:32:31,717
- That's K-E-V-O-R-K-I-A-N.
- Jack: THIS IS NOT AN AD.

568
00:32:31,817 --> 00:32:33,852
I just don't want to give
the wrong impression.

569
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:36,655
I am not here advertising.
I'm-- I'm--

570
00:32:36,755 --> 00:32:38,724
( tools clinking )

571
00:32:51,003 --> 00:32:54,340
- HI, THERE.
- ( ratchet clicks )

572
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:58,277
OH, NO.
NOT YOU, LADY.

573
00:32:58,377 --> 00:33:00,612
- OH, STOP IT. STOP IT.
- STAY AWAY FROM ME, LADY.

574
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:03,715
I DON'T BITE.
I'M SORRY I BACKED OUT
ON YOU THAT WAY,

575
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,917
BUT THAT'S WATER UNDER
THE BRIDGE. I THINK WE NEED
TO HAVE A CONVERSATION.

576
00:33:06,018 --> 00:33:07,919
- WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE?
- YEAH.

577
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:11,023
I ENDED UP USING
MY V.W. VAN IN THE PARK.

578
00:33:11,123 --> 00:33:12,458
WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE?

579
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:14,626
THAT WAS VERY
RESOURCEFUL OF YOU.

580
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:18,330
- OH, THANK YOU.
- I KNOW THAT YOU'RE UPSET,
BUT YOU HAVE TO LET IT GO.

581
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:20,432
WE NEED TO HAVE
A BIGGER CONVERSATION.

582
00:33:20,532 --> 00:33:23,869
AND THAT'S
A MUCH BETTER SWEATER.

583
00:33:23,969 --> 00:33:26,238
IT'S MORE CHEERFUL.

584
00:33:27,106 --> 00:33:28,807
( knife clinking )

585
00:33:28,907 --> 00:33:32,278
Jack:
YOU KNOW, I DON'T GET
MANY VISITORS UP HERE,

586
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:35,647
WOMEN ESPECIALLY.

587
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:38,450
WITH YOUR CHARMS,
I'M SHOCKED.

588
00:33:40,586 --> 00:33:42,321
I HOPE YOU LIKE IT.

589
00:33:42,421 --> 00:33:46,558
- I MADE IT
JUST FOR YOU.
- THANK YOU.

590
00:33:48,994 --> 00:33:52,030
YOU KNOW, DOC,
YOU HAVE TO STOP PUSHING

591
00:33:52,131 --> 00:33:53,799
FOR ORGAN DONATIONS.

592
00:33:53,899 --> 00:33:58,570
IT'D BE BETTER
IF YOU JUST FOCUSED
ON ONE THING AT A TIME.

593
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,406
THAT SOUNDS LIKE
IT COMES STRAIGHT OUT

594
00:34:00,506 --> 00:34:03,609
OF THE OLD
HEMLOCK SOCIETY PLAYBOOK.

595
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:06,212
I'M THE FIRST TO ADMIT
HEMLOCK HAS ITS FAULTS.

596
00:34:06,312 --> 00:34:08,447
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.
THAT'S WHY I AGREE

597
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:11,350
THAT IT SHOULD BE
SELF-DETERMINATION
WITHOUT COMPROMISE.

598
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:13,585
AND FOR THE RECORD,
I ALSO AGREE

599
00:34:13,685 --> 00:34:16,088
THAT "TERMINALLY ILL" IS
AN UNDEFINABLE TERM.

600
00:34:16,188 --> 00:34:19,591
SO I SAY ESTABLISH
YOUR CRITERIA--

601
00:34:19,691 --> 00:34:22,561
YOU KNOW, MULTIPLE
DOCTOR EXAMINATIONS,
PSYCH ASSESSMENTS--

602
00:34:22,661 --> 00:34:27,366
MAKE SURE THAT
ALL PHYSICAL TREATMENTS
HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED

603
00:34:27,466 --> 00:34:31,437
AND MAYBE THE BLESSING
OF A PRIEST OR A RABBI
WOULD BE GOOD.

604
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:36,675
FUNNY. MY MOM USED
TO MAKE THESE FOR US,
ONLY WITH A PICKLE

605
00:34:37,509 --> 00:34:38,810
AND NO CRUSTS.

606
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,979
SORRY ABOUT THE CRUST.

607
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,149
I USUALLY CUT THEM OFF,

608
00:34:43,249 --> 00:34:46,252
BUT SOMEHOW I THOUGHT
YOU'D LIKE CRUST.

609
00:34:48,987 --> 00:34:52,624
SHE WAS TORTURED
IN A NURSING HOME
TILL THE DAY SHE DIED--

610
00:34:52,724 --> 00:34:56,262
MIND GONE, BED SORES
THE SIZE OF DINNER PLATES.

611
00:34:56,362 --> 00:34:58,764
IF YOU LOOKED IN THEM,
YOU COULD SEE HER SPINE.

612
00:35:00,532 --> 00:35:02,568
WHO WAS IT FOR YOU?
YOUR MOTHER?

613
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:05,237
YOUR FATHER?

614
00:35:05,337 --> 00:35:08,207
I DON'T SEE ANY PICTURES
ANYWHERE OF ANYBODY.

615
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:12,844
YOU KNOW,
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT,
WHAT YOU SAID BEFORE.

616
00:35:15,714 --> 00:35:18,417
ONE THING AT A TIME.

617
00:35:20,819 --> 00:35:22,388
FAIR ENOUGH.

618
00:35:22,488 --> 00:35:24,856
SO, UMM...

619
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:26,692
I WAS SNOOPING AROUND
A LITTLE BIT.

620
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:29,928
- OH YEAH.
- CAN YOU TELL ME

621
00:35:30,028 --> 00:35:33,765
ABOUT MARJORIE WANTZ
AND SHERRY MILLER?

622
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:37,869
SURE. MS. MILLER HAS M.S.

623
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,571
AND SHE'S HAD IT
FOR A DECADE.

624
00:35:39,671 --> 00:35:41,840
SHE HAS HARDLY
A MOTOR SKILL LEFT.

625
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:45,744
HER HUSBAND TOOK OFF
A MONTH AFTER THE DIAGNOSIS.

626
00:35:45,844 --> 00:35:49,615
AND WE'VE GOT
MRS. WANTZ WHO HAS
SEVERE PELVIC PAIN.

627
00:35:49,715 --> 00:35:52,351
SHE'S HAD 10 OPERATIONS,
ALL FOR NAUGHT.

628
00:35:52,451 --> 00:35:54,220
THE PAIN'S COMPLETELY
DEBILITATING.

629
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,589
I'VE THOUGHT
ABOUT IT A LONG TIME.

630
00:35:57,689 --> 00:35:59,791
A LONG TIME.

631
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:01,793
YEAH, I HAVE,

632
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:05,231
AND I HAVE NO QUALMS

633
00:36:05,331 --> 00:36:07,233
ABOUT MY DECISION.

634
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:09,100
I COULD DO IT TONIGHT.

635
00:36:09,201 --> 00:36:11,570
Jack:
WHAT IS IT YOU WANT?

636
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:15,707
- PUT IT IN PLAIN ENGLISH.
- YEAH, I WANT-- I WANT TO DI.

637
00:36:15,807 --> 00:36:19,378
- Jack: THAT'S PLAIN ENOUGH.
- YUP. YUP.

638
00:36:19,478 --> 00:36:24,149
YOU DON'T WANNA HAVE
ONE MORE THANKSGIVING
WITH YOUR KIDS?

639
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:26,352
NO NO NO.

640
00:36:26,452 --> 00:36:29,255
I JUST WANT IT
OVER QUICK.

641
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:33,392
I HAVE NO FEAR.

642
00:36:33,492 --> 00:36:35,627
Marjorie:
I HAVE TRIED, MYSELF,

643
00:36:35,727 --> 00:36:38,230
THREE DIFFERENT TIMES
AND I HAVE NOT SUCCEEDED.

644
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:41,433
I TRIED IT,
AS YOU KNOW, WITH THE CAR.

645
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:44,002
- MM-HMM.
- I PUT THE HOSE
ON THE EXHAUST

646
00:36:44,102 --> 00:36:45,704
AND INTO THE WINDOW.

647
00:36:45,804 --> 00:36:48,240
I STAYED IN THE CAR
OVER THREE HOURS

648
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:51,243
AND I TRIED IT THREE TIMES.
NOTHING HAPPENED.

649
00:36:51,343 --> 00:36:53,545
I GET A HALF HOUR,
AN HOUR SLEEP AT NIGHT

650
00:36:53,645 --> 00:36:56,214
WITH ALL THE PILLS
AND SLEEPING PILLS I TAKE.

651
00:36:56,315 --> 00:36:59,685
AND IT'S--
WHEN YOU'VE GOT NO QUALITY

652
00:36:59,785 --> 00:37:01,720
OF LIFE LEFT,

653
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:04,556
IT'S-- NO. NO MORE.

654
00:37:05,491 --> 00:37:07,393
IF I DO ONE OF YOU,

655
00:37:07,493 --> 00:37:10,329
THERE'S A CHANCE
THEY'LL SEND ME TO JAIL.

656
00:37:10,429 --> 00:37:13,465
I WON'T BE ABLE
TO DO THE OTHER.

657
00:37:17,002 --> 00:37:18,437
( police radio chatter )

658
00:37:18,537 --> 00:37:19,838
- ( siren blaring )
- ( car door opens )

659
00:37:19,938 --> 00:37:21,607
Man:
IT'S RIGHT THERE.

660
00:37:23,842 --> 00:37:25,811
( camera clicking )

661
00:37:25,911 --> 00:37:27,546
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE, HUH?

662
00:37:27,646 --> 00:37:29,247
THEY'RE DEAD.
WAIT TILL YOU SEE THIS.

663
00:37:29,348 --> 00:37:31,883
- ( men chattering )
- EXCUSE ME.

664
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:34,553
- Man Â£2: EXCUSE ME.
- ( camera clicking )

665
00:37:36,355 --> 00:37:38,056
TWO AT A TIME NOW.

666
00:37:38,156 --> 00:37:39,658
WHAT'S NEXT,
A BAKER'S DOZEN?

667
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:41,527
- RIGHT THIS WAY.
- DON'T TOUCH THAT.

668
00:37:41,627 --> 00:37:43,595
Jack:
I'M GONNA SAY ALL YOU DID
WAS DRIVE ME UP HERE.

669
00:37:43,695 --> 00:37:46,698
Neal:
AS LONG AS THEY DON'T
PUT US IN THE SAME CELL,

670
00:37:46,798 --> 00:37:49,301
- I'M FINE.
- Jack: YOU SHOULD
BE SO LUCKY.

671
00:37:49,401 --> 00:37:51,970
NO NO NO NO NO.
SIR, IT'S JUST HIM WE WANT.

672
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:55,541
Dr. Jack Kevorkian has been
involved in a double suicide

673
00:37:55,641 --> 00:37:59,044
at the Bald Mountain
recreation area up
near Lake Orion.

674
00:37:59,144 --> 00:38:00,412
We're trying
to get in touch

675
00:38:00,512 --> 00:38:02,548
with our correspondent
up at the scene there

676
00:38:02,648 --> 00:38:04,416
about 40 miles north
of Detroit.

677
00:38:04,516 --> 00:38:06,685
Details are sketchy.

678
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:09,521
- Again, it appears that
Dr. Jack Kevorkian...
- Neal: FIEGER!

679
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:13,692
...has indeed assisted
a double suicide
this evening.

680
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:16,695
- Woman: HERE WE GO.
- We're going to go live
to the scene now

681
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:18,930
- and stay on the story.
- Man: BOBBY!

682
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,932
Fieger:
Where's Jack?

683
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:23,835
- Man Â£2:
CAN YOU COMMENT ON--
- THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

684
00:38:23,935 --> 00:38:26,905
IT'S ABSURD.
NO CRIME HAS BEEN COMMITTED.

685
00:38:27,005 --> 00:38:29,675
Release him.
Release him now.

686
00:38:29,775 --> 00:38:31,777
Man Â£3:
EVERYBODY SETTLE DOWN.

687
00:38:31,877 --> 00:38:34,212
- ( people chattering )
- Fieger: Is this live?

688
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,814
- Dr. Kevorkian!
- This better be live.

689
00:38:35,914 --> 00:38:37,816
- CAN WE GET
YOUR STATEMENT, SIR?
- Two very sick

690
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:41,052
BUT WONDERFUL
WOMEN DIED HERE TONIGHT
BY THEIR OWN CHOOSING.

691
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,689
DR. KEVORKIAN WAS
ONLY ACTING OUT

692
00:38:43,789 --> 00:38:45,591
as-- as--
as their physician.

693
00:38:45,691 --> 00:38:48,694
He did not force anyone
to come up here.

694
00:38:48,794 --> 00:38:51,997
Mr. Thompson,
if you're watching,

695
00:38:52,097 --> 00:38:55,133
Have the gall to charge
Dr. Kevorkian tonight.

696
00:38:55,233 --> 00:38:58,136
Bring it on!
Do it tonight!

697
00:38:58,236 --> 00:39:01,373
Reporters:
Mr. Fieger! Mr. Fieger!
Dr. Kevorkian!

698
00:39:01,473 --> 00:39:03,642
( softly )
DON'T LET THEM
DO THIS TO ME.

699
00:39:03,742 --> 00:39:06,945
( softly )
THIS IS HOW YOU PLAY
THE MEDIA, JACK.

700
00:39:07,045 --> 00:39:09,715
GET READY TO BECOME
THE MOST FAMOUS DOCTOR
IN THE COUNTRY.

701
00:39:09,815 --> 00:39:12,651
ISN'T THIS MURDER?
WOULD YOU CARE

702
00:39:12,751 --> 00:39:14,386
TO COMMENT ON
THE RELIGIOUS ASPECTS OF THIS?

703
00:39:14,486 --> 00:39:17,322
Woman:
WHAT WERE THEY
SUFFERING FROM?

704
00:39:17,423 --> 00:39:19,558
( silent )

705
00:39:28,634 --> 00:39:31,369
I NEED YOU TO DO
YOUR JOB, DR. DRAGOVIC,

706
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:32,938
SO I CAN DO MINE.

707
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:36,975
SCIENCE ITSELF GIVES US
NO ARGUMENTS, MR. THOMPSON.

708
00:39:43,615 --> 00:39:45,216
Man:
THAT'S THE WAY
YOU'RE GONNA DO IT.

709
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:47,352
Jack:
I TOLD YOU I'M NOT
GONNA TOUCH YOUR FOOD.

710
00:39:47,453 --> 00:39:51,923
IT WOULD BE AN ADMISSION
OF GUILT, YOU KNOW?

711
00:39:53,792 --> 00:39:57,028
I CAN GO FOR WEEKS
WITHOUT FOOD,

712
00:39:57,128 --> 00:40:00,632
- LIKE GHANDI.
- Fieger: YOU'RE LOOKING
WORSE THAN GHANDI, JACK.

713
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:03,101
- Jack: YEAH.
- YOU LOOK LIKE ONE
OF YOUR PATIENTS.

714
00:40:03,201 --> 00:40:06,304
IT'S BEEN THREE DAYS.
COME ON.

715
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:09,274
I'M NOT MOVING.
I'M NOT PAYING THAT BOND.

716
00:40:09,374 --> 00:40:11,543
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.
I DID.

717
00:40:11,643 --> 00:40:13,945
- COME ON, LET'S GO.
- Jack: YOU DIDN'T.

718
00:40:14,045 --> 00:40:16,347
YOU PAID MY BAIL?

719
00:40:16,448 --> 00:40:18,650
YEAH, I BAILED
YOU OUT. LET'S GO.

720
00:40:20,952 --> 00:40:22,387
WHAT KIND OF LAWYER
DOES THAT?

721
00:40:22,488 --> 00:40:24,389
WHAT THE MATTER
WITH YOU, GEOFF?

722
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:27,158
DON'T YOU SEE I'M DENYING
MYSELF NOURISHMENT?

723
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,695
I'M-- I'M--
I'M STARVING TO DEATH

724
00:40:29,795 --> 00:40:32,397
FOR THREE DAYS
TO MAKE A POINT.

725
00:40:32,498 --> 00:40:34,466
- I GET IT. I GET IT.
- THIS IS A PROTEST.

726
00:40:34,566 --> 00:40:36,468
THEY VIOLATED MY RIGHTS.

727
00:40:36,568 --> 00:40:39,037
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO BAIL ME OUT.

728
00:40:39,137 --> 00:40:40,672
IT DEFEATS THE PURPOSE.

729
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:42,741
OH, I SHOULD FIRE YOU,
YOU KNOW?

730
00:40:42,841 --> 00:40:46,612
WE'RE FACING AN INDICTMENT
ON WANTZ AND MILLER.

731
00:40:46,712 --> 00:40:49,815
- OH.
- HERE.

732
00:40:49,915 --> 00:40:52,117
WHAT'S THIS?

733
00:40:52,217 --> 00:40:53,852
PIE.

734
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:56,187
THIS IS FULL
OF FAT AND SUGAR.
ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME?

735
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,823
JUST EAT
THE FUCKING PIE, JACK.

736
00:40:57,923 --> 00:41:00,125
- ( groans )
- ( phone ringing )

737
00:41:02,628 --> 00:41:03,795
OH, AND ANOTHER THING--

738
00:41:03,895 --> 00:41:05,964
THE STATE REVOKED
YOUR MEDICAL LICENSE.

739
00:41:06,064 --> 00:41:09,367
GOOD. THEY TOOK AWAY
MY CAREER YEARS AGO.

740
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,302
IT DIDN'T STOP ME,
DID IT?

741
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:14,840
YEAH, WELL, IT STOPS
SUPPLIERS FROM PROVIDING
YOU WITH YOUR POISONS.

742
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:17,909
THAT'S WHAT
I'VE GOT NEAL FOR.

743
00:41:21,747 --> 00:41:23,515
Fieger:
WHERE THE HELL
ARE YOU GOING?

744
00:41:23,615 --> 00:41:25,250
Jack:
HOME.

745
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:26,852
WELL, COME ON,
I'LL GIVE YOU A RIDE.

746
00:41:26,952 --> 00:41:29,320
- MY CAR'S UP HERE.
- NO, I NEED THE EXERCISE.

747
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:30,956
I NEED TO GET
THE BLOOD FLOWING.

748
00:41:31,056 --> 00:41:33,491
WE'VE GOT AN OFFER
TO FLY TO NEW YORK

749
00:41:33,592 --> 00:41:34,860
TO DO
THE BARBARA WALTERS SHOW.

750
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,229
WELL, IF BARBARA WALTERS
WANTS ME BADLY ENOUGH,

751
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:39,497
SHE KNOWS WHERE
TO FIND ME.

752
00:41:39,598 --> 00:41:41,032
DON'T MAKE THIS
COMPLICATED, JACK.

753
00:41:41,132 --> 00:41:44,703
- CAN'T DO IT.
- THIS IS IMPORTANT.

754
00:41:44,803 --> 00:41:48,940
ONE TOO MANY
PASSENGER RIDES
IN A F-86 SABRE

755
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,609
WHEN I WAS
STATIONED IN SEOUL.

756
00:41:50,709 --> 00:41:54,580
FLYING SCARES THE DAYLIGHTS
OUT OF ME, GEOFF.

757
00:41:55,413 --> 00:41:58,216
NIGHTY NIGHT!

758
00:41:58,316 --> 00:42:00,686
( classical score playing )

759
00:42:32,584 --> 00:42:34,519
Barbara Walters:
DOCTOR, LET ME BE FRANK.

760
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:37,455
YOU'RE AWARE THAT PEOPLE
THINK YOU ARE A GHOUL?

761
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,591
IT'S EMOTIONALISM.

762
00:42:39,691 --> 00:42:43,461
WHEN HEART TRANSPLANTS
FIRST STARTED,

763
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:46,598
THERE WAS THE SAME
PREVALENT FEELING,

764
00:42:46,698 --> 00:42:48,499
EVEN AMONG DOCTORS,
THAT IT WAS WRONG.

765
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,302
IT WAS CONTRARY
TO GOD'S WILL,

766
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,138
CONTRARY TO NATURE.

767
00:42:53,238 --> 00:42:56,341
ISN'T IT
GHOULISH TO RIP

768
00:42:56,441 --> 00:42:58,276
A PERSON'S CHEST OPEN

769
00:42:58,376 --> 00:42:59,711
AND TAKE OUT A HEART,

770
00:42:59,811 --> 00:43:03,782
OR A BYPASS OPERATION?

771
00:43:03,882 --> 00:43:05,751
ETHER IS
THE SAME THING.

772
00:43:05,851 --> 00:43:08,219
YOU HAVE ETHER,
BEEN AROUND FOR CENTURIES--

773
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,255
IT WASN'T USED,

774
00:43:10,355 --> 00:43:12,724
NOT TILL 1846.

775
00:43:12,824 --> 00:43:15,460
IT WAS DISCOVERED
IN 1543, AND BEFORE THAT

776
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:18,997
EVERYBODY WAS
BEING OPERATED ON
WHILE THEY WERE AWAKE!

777
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:21,867
SURGEONS WERE
CUTTING THEM OPEN
WHILE THEY WERE AWAKE.

778
00:43:21,967 --> 00:43:23,669
DID YOU KNOW THAT, GEOFF?

779
00:43:23,769 --> 00:43:26,337
- NO.
- OH, YES. AND YOU KNOW
WHY IT WAS BANNED?

780
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:28,940
BECAUSE OF RELIGIOUS DOGMA.

781
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,843
BECAUSE
OF THE FOOLISH NOTION

782
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:35,747
THAT THERE'S A GOD ALMIGHTY
WHO WILLS US TO SUFFER.

783
00:43:35,847 --> 00:43:37,515
DO YOU TURN
PATIENTS DOWN?

784
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:40,919
I TURN-- 97% TO 98%

785
00:43:41,019 --> 00:43:43,454
OF THE PATIENTS
WHO CONTACT ME,
I TURN THEM DOWN.

786
00:43:43,554 --> 00:43:45,991
SHOULD THERE BE
SECOND OPINIONS?

787
00:43:46,091 --> 00:43:48,760
ALWAYS A SECOND OPINION.
A THIRD OPINION.
( chuckles )

788
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:51,863
- BUT THERE WASN'T IN YOUR CASE.
- NO, THERE WASN'T,

789
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:53,865
BECAUSE NO ONE
COOPERATES WITH ME.

790
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:55,734
WHAT DO YOU SAY
TO PEOPLE WHO SAY,

791
00:43:55,834 --> 00:43:58,169
"DR. KEVORKIAN,
YOU ARE PLAYING GOD"?

792
00:43:58,269 --> 00:44:00,638
I SAY TO THEM,

793
00:44:00,739 --> 00:44:03,141
"SO WHAT?"
( chuckles )

794
00:44:03,241 --> 00:44:06,845
WHEN A DOCTOR GIVES YOU
A PILL, HE'S PLAYING GOD

795
00:44:06,945 --> 00:44:09,915
BECAUSE HE'S INTERFERING
WITH YOUR NATURAL PROCESS.

796
00:44:10,015 --> 00:44:12,550
ALL DOCTORS BELIEVE
THEY'RE GOD.

797
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,619
THEY SHOULDN'T,
BUT THEY DO.

798
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,888
BUT I PREFER THAT
THAN THE DOCTORS

799
00:44:16,988 --> 00:44:19,524
WHO ARE MORE INTERESTED
IN THEIR STOCK PORTFOLIOS

800
00:44:19,624 --> 00:44:21,359
THAN THEY ARE
IN THEIR PATIENTS.

801
00:44:21,459 --> 00:44:23,729
( chatting )

802
00:44:23,829 --> 00:44:26,631
DID YOU SEE THE WAY
SHE LOOKED AT YOU?

803
00:44:26,732 --> 00:44:28,734
SHE PROBABLY THOUGHT
I WAS UNATTAINABLE.

804
00:44:28,834 --> 00:44:30,435
SHE WAS VERY SMITTEN.

805
00:44:30,535 --> 00:44:33,839
- ( chuckles )
- I KNEW I SHOULD'VE
CALLED HER BARBARA.

806
00:44:33,939 --> 00:44:35,974
- COFFEE?
- YEAH.

807
00:44:36,074 --> 00:44:39,310
- DECAF?
- NO NO, DECAF'S FOR COWARDS.

808
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:41,512
Thompson:
THE AUTOPSY PROVED
THAT MRS. WANTZ HAD

809
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:44,149
NO ANATOMICAL EVIDENCE
OF DISEASE IN HER ENTIRE BODY.

810
00:44:44,249 --> 00:44:45,917
IT WAS ALL IN HER HEAD
AND HE KNOWS IT.

811
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:48,053
AND MRS. MILLER,
ALTHOUGH SHE HAD
A TERRIBLE DISEASE,

812
00:44:48,153 --> 00:44:49,888
COULD HAVE LIVED
FOR MANY YEARS

813
00:44:49,988 --> 00:44:51,990
IF SHE HAD BEEN MORE
WILLING TO PARTICIPATE
IN HER OWN CARE.

814
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:55,894
AH. SO YOU'RE
A DOCTOR TOO NOW, DICK?
( chuckles )

815
00:44:55,994 --> 00:44:57,763
YOUR HONOR,
THERE ISN'T ONE IOTA,

816
00:44:57,863 --> 00:45:00,098
ONE SCINTILLA,
ONE SPECK OF EVIDENCE

817
00:45:00,198 --> 00:45:02,367
THAT HE MURDERED
MARJORIE WANTZ OR
SHERRY MILLER.

818
00:45:02,467 --> 00:45:05,503
THIS IS ALL PART OF YOUR
PURITANICAL PERSECUTION

819
00:45:05,603 --> 00:45:07,773
- OF DR. KEVORKIAN.
- ENOUGH. I'VE REVIEWED
THE INDICTMENT.

820
00:45:07,873 --> 00:45:09,941
I'M DISMISSING
THE CHARGES.

821
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:12,677
THE ACT OF ASSISTING
A SUICIDE IS NOT
A CRIMINAL ACT

822
00:45:12,778 --> 00:45:14,813
ACCORDING
TO OUR CURRENT LAWS.

823
00:45:14,913 --> 00:45:17,615
BUT WITHOUT A MEDICAL LICENSE,
HE CANNOT DISPENSE MEDICATION,

824
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:20,585
- SO DON'T DO
ANYTHING STUPID.
- HE WON'T, YOUR HONOR.

825
00:45:20,685 --> 00:45:24,923
I'M GONNA KICK YOUR ASS
TILL MY LEGS FALL OFF.

826
00:45:25,023 --> 00:45:26,758
IT WAS A CLEAR VICTORY
FOR THE MOST IMPORTANT

827
00:45:26,858 --> 00:45:28,459
CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE
OF OUR TIME.

828
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,929
SO YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY NOT HAPPY
WITH THE JUDGE'S DECISION.

829
00:45:31,029 --> 00:45:34,665
- WHERE DO YOU GO FROM HERE?
- GOVERNOR ENGLER NEEDS
TO PUSH A BAN THROUGH

830
00:45:34,766 --> 00:45:37,969
the state legislature--
something, anything--

831
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:40,238
unless you want
Michigan to become

832
00:45:40,338 --> 00:45:42,407
the suicide capital
of the world.

833
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:48,947
Lessenberry:
MICHIGAN RESIDENTS,
BY A 5:1 MARGIN

834
00:45:49,047 --> 00:45:52,083
SAID THAT THEY'D
ACQUIT HIM OF MURDER
IF THEY WERE ON A JURY

835
00:45:52,183 --> 00:45:54,285
AND OVER 70% BELIEVE
THAT DOCTORS SHOULD
BE ABLE ALLOWED

836
00:45:54,385 --> 00:45:57,688
TO HELP A TERMINALLY-ILL
PATIENT COMMIT SUICIDE.

837
00:45:57,789 --> 00:46:00,591
( van door closes )

838
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:03,261
I'M A DEEPLY
RELIGIOUS MAN,
MR. LESSENBERRY,

839
00:46:03,361 --> 00:46:08,699
AND WHAT KEVORKIAN
PROPOSES GOES AGAINST
EVERY FIBER OF MY BEING.

840
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,036
- IF THIS WERE ACCEPTED...
- ROOM SERVICE.

841
00:46:11,136 --> 00:46:14,272
...HOW ON GOD'S GREEN EARTH
WOULD WE PREVENT ABUSE?

842
00:46:14,372 --> 00:46:16,207
Neal:
NOBODY HERE ORDERED
ANY ROOM SERVICE!

843
00:46:16,307 --> 00:46:18,443
- Jack: Who is this? Hello?
- Man: Open the door.

844
00:46:18,543 --> 00:46:20,511
- WHO IS THIS?
- Man: IT'S THE POLICE, JACK.
WE KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE.

845
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:23,014
- Jack: WHAT IS THIS?
- Get out of the way.
Get out of the way.

846
00:46:23,114 --> 00:46:25,050
- Don't you push me, sir.
- Where is it, Jack?

847
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:26,918
Nothing is going on here.
We're just talking.

848
00:46:27,018 --> 00:46:29,020
- Man Â£2: where are
you folks from?
- California.

849
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,156
- Nothing illegal is going on.
- Why are you harassing us?
We're not criminals!

850
00:46:31,256 --> 00:46:32,924
- You don't have to say a word.
- What's in the case?

851
00:46:33,024 --> 00:46:35,193
Thompson:
I KNOW THAT TOO MANY
SICK PEOPLE LACK ACCESS

852
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:38,563
TO CARE AND SUPPORT,
TOO MANY FAMILIES ARE SADDLED
WITH MEDICAL EXPENSES,

853
00:46:38,663 --> 00:46:42,067
BUT IF THIS WERE LEGALIZED,
IT COULD LEAD TO COST-
CONTAINMENT STRATEGIES.

854
00:46:42,167 --> 00:46:44,369
- WE'RE HERE
TO PREVENT A SUICIDE.
- WE CAME TO SAVE YOUR LIFE.

855
00:46:44,469 --> 00:46:46,704
- CHECK THIS OUT.
- WHO THE HELL ASKED YOU TO?

856
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:50,441
- WHO THE HELL ASK YOU?
- I'M SORRY, ISABEL.

857
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:54,179
WHERE IS THE SUICIDE POISONS?
WHERE DO YOU KEEP THEM?

858
00:46:54,279 --> 00:46:56,347
- DON'T THEY HAVE TO
HAVE A SEARCH WARRANT?
- A SEARCH WARRANT?

859
00:46:56,447 --> 00:46:59,484
THIS IS NOT
THE WORLD I RAISED
MY THREE BOYS IN.

860
00:46:59,584 --> 00:47:02,720
IT'S NOT A WORLD
I'D RECOGNIZE.

861
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,890
"NOT A WORLD
I WOULD RECOGNIZE"?

862
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:07,192
WHAT IS THIS
DICK THOMPSON BULLSHIT?

863
00:47:07,292 --> 00:47:09,094
Lessenberry:
I believe it's
called journalism.

864
00:47:09,194 --> 00:47:10,962
Both sides deserve
a voice, Geoff.

865
00:47:11,062 --> 00:47:13,064
WELL, FUCK THAT
AND FUCK YOU!

866
00:47:13,164 --> 00:47:15,533
You think you're hot shit
because "The New York Times"
is printing you?

867
00:47:15,633 --> 00:47:19,370
LOOK. THERE'S ONLY ONE SIDE
TO THIS STORY-- OURS.

868
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:21,907
DON'T LET ME CUT OFF
YOUR ACCESS TO JACK.

869
00:47:22,007 --> 00:47:23,909
( distant siren )

870
00:47:24,009 --> 00:47:26,177
( police radio chatter )

871
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:35,286
I FEEL
FOR OUR PATIENTS.

872
00:47:35,386 --> 00:47:38,323
- THEY DESERVE BETTER.
- Neal: YEAH.

873
00:47:40,025 --> 00:47:44,462
Jack:
SOMEONE LIKE ISABEL,
SHE DESERVES RESPECT.

874
00:47:46,064 --> 00:47:48,633
WHAT ARE WE DOING
SNEAKING AROUND

875
00:47:48,733 --> 00:47:51,169
LIKE WE'RE THIEVES?
WHAT IS THAT?

876
00:47:51,269 --> 00:47:54,139
- WE'RE THE GOOD GUYS.
- YEAH.

877
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:57,042
THEY BUST DOWN
THE MOTEL DOOR

878
00:47:57,142 --> 00:47:59,310
WITH CROWBARS AND GUNS

879
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:02,447
LIKE WE'RE-- WE'RE SOME
CHICAGO BOOTLEGGERS.

880
00:48:02,547 --> 00:48:05,883
WE HAVE TO HIDE 'EM
IN PLACES LIKE THIS.

881
00:48:06,851 --> 00:48:09,187
WE HAVE TO
HANDLE THESE THINGS

882
00:48:09,287 --> 00:48:12,590
IN THE BACKS OF VANS
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT,

883
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:15,793
DROP BODIES OFF

884
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:19,130
IN EMERGENCY ROOM
PARKING LOTS.

885
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:24,035
WE'RE NOT CRIMINALS.

886
00:48:24,135 --> 00:48:25,670
WE'RE NOT CRIMINALS.

887
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:28,473
THE CRIMINALS ARE THOSE
WHO ARE TRYING TO STOP US.

888
00:48:28,573 --> 00:48:30,475
THOSE ARE THE ONES
THAT SHOULD BE ASHAMED.

889
00:48:30,575 --> 00:48:32,643
Woman over radio:
0-1-5-0-6, Saginaw Motel.

890
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:34,612
0-1-5-0-6,
Saginaw Motel.

891
00:48:34,712 --> 00:48:37,848
Reported assisted suicide.
Dr. Jack Kevorkian.

892
00:48:37,949 --> 00:48:41,286
HUH. THIS MAY COUNT
AS LOITERING.

893
00:48:41,386 --> 00:48:44,322
WE SHOULDN'T BE
OUT HERE TOO LONG
WITHOUT AN ATTORNEY.

894
00:48:47,993 --> 00:48:50,495
- LET'S GO.
- YUP.

895
00:48:50,595 --> 00:48:53,698
Woman over radio:
0-6-1-1-9, 0-6-1-1-9,

896
00:48:53,798 --> 00:48:58,303
- Suspect not on premises.
- ( radio chatter continues )

897
00:48:58,403 --> 00:49:01,506
- Female, late 50s.
- Woman Â£2: 7-8-5,
No resident here.

898
00:49:01,606 --> 00:49:03,074
Woman Â£3:
R-34, roger.

899
00:49:03,174 --> 00:49:06,211
C-3-3-5, Cleared out
number 1 to number 3.

900
00:49:33,638 --> 00:49:36,307
Jack:
PLEASE TELL ME WHAT
IT IS YOUR DAUGHTER HAS

901
00:49:36,407 --> 00:49:39,210
IN HER BRAIN THAT WON'T
LET HER ACCEPT THE FACT

902
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:42,413
THAT YOU CAN PAY
A BILL WITH CASH?

903
00:49:42,513 --> 00:49:44,682
- PLEASE. I DID.
- AND THE ONE THING--

904
00:49:44,782 --> 00:49:47,285
- WHAT YOU DON'T DO--
WHAT YOU DON'T DO...
- CALM DOWN.

905
00:49:47,385 --> 00:49:50,055
- SHH.
- ...IS PAY WITH A CHECK.

906
00:49:50,155 --> 00:49:51,956
YOU DON'T PAY BILLS
WITH A CHECK.

907
00:49:52,057 --> 00:49:55,960
WHY, MY DEAR GIRL?
BECAUSE BILLS PAID BY CHECK

908
00:49:56,061 --> 00:49:57,528
LEAVE A PAPER TRAIL.

909
00:49:57,628 --> 00:50:00,231
A PAPER TRAIL IS SOMETHING
SOMEONE CAN FOLLOW,

910
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:01,932
AND JUST SO YOU KNOW--

911
00:50:02,033 --> 00:50:04,235
JUST SO YOU KNOW,

912
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:06,904
WHAT I PREDICTED
HAS COME TRUE.

913
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:09,340
THE COPS TRACED--

914
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:12,009
- THE COPS?
- THEY TRACED IT

915
00:50:12,110 --> 00:50:15,046
TO MY STORAGE FILE.

916
00:50:15,146 --> 00:50:17,582
THEY BROKE IN
AND THEY TOOK--

917
00:50:17,682 --> 00:50:20,118
WHATEVER, WHO KNOWS?
--ALL MY PERSONAL FILES

918
00:50:20,218 --> 00:50:21,986
TO DO GOD KNOWS
WHAT WITH.

919
00:50:22,087 --> 00:50:24,155
- AND NOW THEY PADLOCKED IT...
- ALL RIGHT.

920
00:50:24,255 --> 00:50:26,224
- ...SO I CAN'T GET IN!
- I'M SORRY ABOUT IT, JACK.

921
00:50:26,324 --> 00:50:28,326
- I'M SORRY.
- YOU'RE SORRY?

922
00:50:28,426 --> 00:50:30,695
I'M SORRY IT HAPPENED.
NO ONE WOULD EXPECT
THIS TO HAPPEN,

923
00:50:30,795 --> 00:50:33,664
AND MR. FIEGER CAN
GET EVERYTHING BACK
FOR YOU AGAIN.

924
00:50:33,764 --> 00:50:35,666
- OH, MR. FIEGER'S GONNA DO IT.
- JUST CALM DOWN.

925
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:38,469
- I HAVE EXPLAINED TO YOU.
- NOBODY'S GONNA PUT

926
00:50:38,569 --> 00:50:41,672
HUMPTY DUMPTY TOGETHER AGAIN.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND? HE IS GONE.

927
00:50:41,772 --> 00:50:45,076
- HE IS FINISHED.
THEY HAVE MY FILES!
- SHH. SHH.

928
00:50:45,176 --> 00:50:48,146
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.
THERE WAS AN OVERDUE BILL...

929
00:50:48,246 --> 00:50:50,548
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- ...AND AVA SENT
THE CHECK IN.

930
00:50:50,648 --> 00:50:52,650
- SHE JUST WASN'T THINKING.
SHE WASN'T THINKING.
- SHE WASN'T THINKING?

931
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:54,852
- WASN'T THINKING?
YOU'RE BEING SO GENEROUS.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

932
00:50:54,952 --> 00:50:58,656
IT WAS STUPID.
IT WAS BLATANT STUPIDIY

933
00:50:58,756 --> 00:51:00,825
- ON HER PART AND YOUR PART.
- KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN.

934
00:51:00,925 --> 00:51:03,728
- STUPID! STUPID.
SHE WAS BEING STUPID.
- HOLD ON THERE.

935
00:51:03,828 --> 00:51:06,764
- STUPID STUPID.
- DON'T YOU TALK ABOUT
MY DAUGHTER THAT WAY.

936
00:51:06,864 --> 00:51:08,533
- I'LL TALK
ABOUT HER THAT WAY.
- DO YOU HEAR ME?

937
00:51:08,633 --> 00:51:10,701
- YOU CALM DOWN. NOW STOP IT!
- I AM COMPLETELY CALM!

938
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:13,438
- CALM DOWN! YOU'RE NOT CALM!
- YOU KNOW, I CAN'T TRUST YOU.

939
00:51:13,538 --> 00:51:15,406
- I CAN'T TRUST YOU
AND I CAN'T TRUST HER.
- YOU CAN'T TRUST ME?

940
00:51:15,506 --> 00:51:18,576
EITHER ONE OF YOU.
TOGETHER. YOU DON'T
MAKE IT EASY FOR ME.

941
00:51:18,676 --> 00:51:20,378
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO MAKE IT EASY FOR ME,
BUT YOU DON'T.

942
00:51:20,478 --> 00:51:22,079
HOW DARE YOU, JACK?
HOW DARE YOU?

943
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:24,282
YOU DID THIS
FOR THE LAST TIME.
FOR THE LAST TIME.

944
00:51:24,382 --> 00:51:26,251
ALL MY LIFE, I'VE BEEN
MAKING IT EASIER FOR YOU.

945
00:51:26,351 --> 00:51:28,619
- YEAH, YOU MAKE IT--
- ALL MY LIFE! DO YOU HEAR ME?

946
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:30,521
- LOOK WHO'S YELLING NOW.
- AND IT'S BEEN NO WALK
IN THE PARK!

947
00:51:30,621 --> 00:51:32,623
THAT'S RIGHT, IT'S BEEN
NO WALK IN THE PARK!

948
00:51:32,723 --> 00:51:35,660
AND I'M GOING TO
TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE--
NOBODY TAKES CARE OF ME.

949
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,695
I WANT TO ASK YOU:
WHO DO YOU THINK
TAKES CARE OF ME?

950
00:51:37,795 --> 00:51:39,664
- NOBODY! NOT YOU, JACK.
- I'M GONNA TAKE CARE OF YOU.

951
00:51:39,764 --> 00:51:41,799
- CERTAINLY NOT YOU!
- RIGHT NOW I'M GONNA
TAKE CARE OF YOU.

952
00:51:41,899 --> 00:51:44,569
FROM NOW ON,
ALL YOU'RE GONNA DO
IS OPERATE THE CAMERA.

953
00:51:44,669 --> 00:51:46,637
THAT'LL TAKE CARE
OF YOU. BELIEVE ME.

954
00:51:46,737 --> 00:51:48,906
YOU'LL BE FINE WITH THAT,
'CAUSE YOU CAN'T
SCREW THAT UP.

955
00:51:49,006 --> 00:51:51,876
- OKAY, IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK?
- AS FOR YOUR DAUGHTER--

956
00:51:51,976 --> 00:51:54,445
- I HAVE NEWS FOR YOU.
- AS FOR YOUR DAUGHTER,
THE JURY IS OUT.

957
00:51:54,545 --> 00:51:56,214
YOU'LL BE DOING
IT FOR YOURSELF.
YOU DO IT FOR YOURSELF.

958
00:51:56,314 --> 00:51:58,516
YOU'RE GONNA DO IT.
HOW'S THAT FOR NEWS?

959
00:51:58,616 --> 00:52:00,318
- YOU'LL DO IT, JACK!
- THAT'S FINE BY ME.

960
00:52:00,418 --> 00:52:02,287
- I'M THROUGH WITH YOU!
- ( alarm beeping )

961
00:52:02,387 --> 00:52:04,889
- I'M THROUGH WITH IT!
- GO AHEAD, SET THE ALARM.

962
00:52:04,989 --> 00:52:06,691
WHO CARES?

963
00:52:06,791 --> 00:52:08,793
IS THIS US? YEAH.

964
00:52:10,295 --> 00:52:12,563
- ( door shuts )
- ( alarm stops )

965
00:52:12,663 --> 00:52:14,365
YOU SET THAT OFF.

966
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:18,236
WHERE THE HELL
IS SHE GOING?

967
00:52:18,336 --> 00:52:20,871
( typewriter clicking )

968
00:52:23,007 --> 00:52:25,610
MARGO, COULD YOU STEP
INTO MY OFFICE

969
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:27,712
FOR A SECOND?
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

970
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:36,387
MY DREAM WAS
TO BE AN OLYMPIC SKIER.

971
00:52:37,788 --> 00:52:42,159
AND AFTER
THE CAR ACCIDENT,
THERE WAS...

972
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:44,229
A CHANCE--

973
00:52:44,329 --> 00:52:46,030
WELL, THEY TOLD ME
THAT THERE WAS A CHANCE

974
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:49,634
THAT I'D GET
THE USE OF MY LEGS AGAIN,
BUT IT NEVER HAPPENED.

975
00:52:49,734 --> 00:52:51,636
SO...

976
00:52:51,736 --> 00:52:55,072
I DOUSED MYSELF
WITH GASOLINE ONE NIGHT

977
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:58,776
AND LIT A MATCH.

978
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:09,153
YOU KNOW, THE ONLY
THING WORSE THAN THIS
NIGHTMARE EXISTENCE

979
00:53:09,254 --> 00:53:11,822
IS THE NIGHTMARE
OF A BOTCHED SUICIDE ATTEMPT.

980
00:53:14,425 --> 00:53:17,528
I WISH I COULD
HELP YOU, SON,
BUT IT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

981
00:53:18,963 --> 00:53:21,366
WHAT-- WHAT YOU'RE
SUFFERING--

982
00:53:22,533 --> 00:53:25,002
WHAT DR. KEVORKIAN IS
TRYING TO SAY, GLEN,

983
00:53:25,102 --> 00:53:27,472
IS THAT YOU'RE
CLINICALLY DEPRESSED,

984
00:53:27,572 --> 00:53:29,674
AND UNDER
THESE CIRCUMSTANCES,
WE CAN'T HELP YOU.

985
00:53:29,774 --> 00:53:32,410
IF YOU DEAL
WITH YOUR DEPRESSION,

986
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:35,513
YOU CAN LEAD A FULFILLING
AND SATISFYING LIFE.

987
00:53:35,613 --> 00:53:39,784
AND WE'LL HELP YOU FIND
SOMEONE THAT WILL DO THAT.

988
00:53:59,203 --> 00:54:01,439
( distant barking )

989
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:07,745
PARKINSON'S
TAKES YEARS--

990
00:54:07,845 --> 00:54:12,917
YEARS BEFORE IT COMPROMISES
YOUR DAILY ACTIVITIES.

991
00:54:13,017 --> 00:54:16,287
I DON'T THINK
WE CAN HELP YOU NOW
IS WHAT I'M SAYING.

992
00:54:16,387 --> 00:54:18,756
BUT IF AND WHEN
THE TIME COMES,

993
00:54:18,856 --> 00:54:20,591
WE'LL BE HERE FOR YOU.

994
00:54:20,691 --> 00:54:22,827
OKAY.

995
00:54:37,007 --> 00:54:38,876
( knocks on door )

996
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:46,517
YOU KNOW I'VE NEVER BEEN
ONE TO HOLD GRUDGES

997
00:54:46,617 --> 00:54:49,320
AND I'D LIKE TO LET
BYGONES BE BYGONES.

998
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:51,221
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

999
00:54:51,322 --> 00:54:53,391
GOOD.

1000
00:54:54,359 --> 00:54:57,194
SO WE'RE RECONCILED?

1001
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:59,497
- I HOPE SO.
- WELL, THAT'S GOOD.

1002
00:54:59,597 --> 00:55:02,767
GOOD.
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

1003
00:55:02,867 --> 00:55:04,869
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

1004
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:07,838
YOU NEED TO GET READY.

1005
00:55:07,938 --> 00:55:09,840
READY FOR WHAT?

1006
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:11,676
DINNER AT MR. FIEGER'S.

1007
00:55:11,776 --> 00:55:13,678
VERY NICE.

1008
00:55:13,778 --> 00:55:15,480
WHAT'S THAT?

1009
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:18,248
OH, IT'S A NOTICE OF SALE.

1010
00:55:18,349 --> 00:55:21,018
I MEAN, THIS WHOLE
BUILDING'S KAPUT.

1011
00:55:21,118 --> 00:55:23,421
WELL, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

1012
00:55:23,521 --> 00:55:25,456
WE CAN LIVE TOGETHER.

1013
00:55:25,556 --> 00:55:29,360
WE'LL BE KNOWN
AS THE UNEMPLOYED
KEVORKIANS! YAY!

1014
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:31,161
UNEMPLOYED?
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

1015
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:33,163
IT MEANS...

1016
00:55:33,263 --> 00:55:34,899
I GOT FIRED.

1017
00:55:34,999 --> 00:55:37,101
NO. WHEN?

1018
00:55:37,935 --> 00:55:39,437
A FEW WEEKS AGO.

1019
00:55:39,537 --> 00:55:41,606
YOU'RE JUST
TELLING ME NOW?

1020
00:55:41,706 --> 00:55:44,709
JACK, WE HAD
A FALLING OUT.

1021
00:55:44,809 --> 00:55:46,511
WHAT HAPPENED?

1022
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:51,148
I'M YOUR SISTER.

1023
00:55:51,248 --> 00:55:53,518
WHAT ELSE?

1024
00:55:53,618 --> 00:55:56,887
( chanting )
LIFE IS GOD'S CHOICE!
LIFE IS GOD'S CHOICE!

1025
00:55:56,987 --> 00:56:01,291
- Margo: OH, MY GOSH.
- THESE ARE MY NEW
DAILY VISITORS.

1026
00:56:01,392 --> 00:56:03,327
LIFE IS GOD'S CHOICE!

1027
00:56:03,428 --> 00:56:07,297
ARE YOU GOING TO KILL
EVERY SINGLE PERSON
IN A WHEELCHAIR?

1028
00:56:07,398 --> 00:56:10,267
DISABLED PEOPLE ARE NOT
WORTHLESS. THEY ARE NOT
A DRAIN ON SOCIETY.

1029
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:12,570
YOU CANNOT RID THE WORLD
OF INCONVENIENCE.

1030
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:14,338
YOU ARE WORSE THAN
AN ABORTIONIST.

1031
00:56:14,439 --> 00:56:15,773
OH, SHUT UP,
YOU WITCH!

1032
00:56:15,873 --> 00:56:18,008
THESE ARE NOT
COMPARABLE ISSUES.

1033
00:56:18,108 --> 00:56:22,179
SOME GREAT MINDS HAVE
DIED WITH THE ASSISTANCE
OF THEIR DOCTORS--

1034
00:56:22,279 --> 00:56:24,649
SIGMUND FREUD,
KING GEORGE.

1035
00:56:24,749 --> 00:56:26,651
Jack:
IF IT'S GOOD ENOUGH
FOR THE ARISTOI,

1036
00:56:26,751 --> 00:56:28,719
IT'S GOOD ENOUGH
FOR THE HOI POLLOI.

1037
00:56:28,819 --> 00:56:32,723
HE IS LEADING SOCIETY
INTO AN AGE OF ENLIGHTENMENT,

1038
00:56:32,823 --> 00:56:35,760
- YOU IDIOTS!
- Woman: ONLY GOD CAN
CREATE AND DESTROY.

1039
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:37,562
HAVE YOU NO RELIGION?
HAVE YOU NO GOD?

1040
00:56:37,662 --> 00:56:40,330
OH, I DO, LADY.
I HAVE A RELIGION.

1041
00:56:40,431 --> 00:56:43,701
HIS NAME IS BACH--
JOHANN SEBASTIAN BACH.

1042
00:56:43,801 --> 00:56:46,403
AND AT LEAST MY GOD ISN'T
AN INVENTED ONE.

1043
00:56:46,504 --> 00:56:49,039
- ( car starts )
- ( chanting resumes )
LIFE IS GOD'S CHOICE!

1044
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:51,341
LIFE IS
GOD'S CHOICE!

1045
00:56:51,442 --> 00:56:53,578
LIFE IS GOD'S CHOICE!

1046
00:56:53,678 --> 00:56:55,913
LIFE IS
GOD'S CHOICE!

1047
00:56:56,013 --> 00:56:58,048
LIFE IS GOD'S CHOICE!

1048
00:56:58,148 --> 00:57:01,886
- LIFE IS GOD'S CHOICE!
- Man: WHO DO YOU
THINK YOU ARE?!

1049
00:57:01,986 --> 00:57:03,954
LIFE IS GOD'S CHOICE!

1050
00:57:04,054 --> 00:57:06,591
- LIFE IS GOD'S CHOICE!
- WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?!

1051
00:57:06,691 --> 00:57:10,027
LIFE IS GOD'S CHOICE!
LIFE IS GOD'S CHOICE!

1052
00:57:10,127 --> 00:57:12,062
LIFE IS
GOD'S CHOICE!

1053
00:57:12,162 --> 00:57:14,965
( chanting fades )

1054
00:57:15,065 --> 00:57:17,001
( silent )

1055
00:57:28,746 --> 00:57:30,681
LIFE IS GOD'S CHOICE!

1056
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:32,917
LIFE IS
GOD'S CHOICE!

1057
00:57:33,017 --> 00:57:35,653
LIFE IS GOD'S CHOICE!

1058
00:57:39,624 --> 00:57:42,893
"A FART
ON THOMAS PUTNAM!"

1059
00:57:42,993 --> 00:57:45,062
( all laugh )

1060
00:57:45,162 --> 00:57:48,165
OF COURSE,
THAT WAS THE LONE LAUGH
IN THE ENTIRE PLAY.

1061
00:57:48,265 --> 00:57:50,868
"BECAUSE IT IS MY NAME.

1062
00:57:50,968 --> 00:57:55,472
BECAUSE I CANNOT HAVE
ANOTHER IN MY LIFE.

1063
00:57:55,573 --> 00:57:58,242
BECAUSE I AM NOT
WORTH THE DUST

1064
00:57:58,342 --> 00:58:01,045
ON THE FEET
OF THEM THAT HANG.

1065
00:58:02,913 --> 00:58:05,516
HOW MAY I LIVE
WITHOUT MY NAME?

1066
00:58:05,616 --> 00:58:08,218
I'VE GIVEN
YOU MY SOUL;

1067
00:58:09,554 --> 00:58:12,222
LEAVE ME MY NAME."

1068
00:58:13,023 --> 00:58:14,659
Woman: OH.

1069
00:58:16,594 --> 00:58:18,596
IS THERE
ANY MORE TO THAT?

1070
00:58:20,164 --> 00:58:23,200
- ( laughing )
- NO.

1071
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:24,969
- Margo: OH, JACK.
- THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL, JACK.

1072
00:58:25,069 --> 00:58:26,804
- THANK YOU.
- I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU KNEW THAT.

1073
00:58:26,904 --> 00:58:29,073
THAT'S VERY GOOD.
THAT WAS GREAT.

1074
00:58:29,173 --> 00:58:31,942
- IT'S ALL I KNOW.
- YOU DIDN'T LIKE
THE SEA BASS?

1075
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:36,180
IT WAS
A BIT FISHY, BUT--

1076
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:38,515
- OH.
- NO NO NO NO.

1077
00:58:41,018 --> 00:58:42,820
WHY DID
YOU NEVER MARRY, JACK?

1078
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:45,055
OH. HE WAS
ENGAGED ONCE.

1079
00:58:45,155 --> 00:58:47,491
SHE WORKED AT HUDSON'S
ON WOODWARD, DOWNTOWN.

1080
00:58:47,592 --> 00:58:50,294
- I KNEW HER. I SAW HER.
- LET'S NOT GO THERE.
LET'S NOT GO THERE.

1081
00:58:50,394 --> 00:58:52,329
- YOU NEVER EVEN LIKED HER.
- NO, I DIDN'T LIKE HER.

1082
00:58:52,429 --> 00:58:54,665
- Jack: LET'S NOT GO THERE.
- ALL RIGHT, I WON'T GO THERE.

1083
00:58:54,765 --> 00:58:57,334
OH, COME ON, COME ON.
TELL ME ABOUT THIS FIANCE.

1084
00:58:57,434 --> 00:59:00,004
- ( groans )
- Margo: COME ON, JACK.
SAY A FEW WORDS.

1085
00:59:00,104 --> 00:59:02,740
- A LITTLE SOMETHING?
- WHAT CAN I TELL YOU?

1086
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:05,309
- WE BROKE UP.
IT WAS-- YOU KNOW--
- I THINK THE TRUTH IS

1087
00:59:05,409 --> 00:59:07,845
THAT GIRLS
JUST MAKE YOU SHAKE
IN YOUR BOOTS, JACK.

1088
00:59:07,945 --> 00:59:09,880
- OKAY. YEAH.
- ALL RIGHT THEN.

1089
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:12,016
SOMEBODY NEEDS
SOME COFFEE.

1090
00:59:12,116 --> 00:59:13,483
SO COME, MARGO,

1091
00:59:13,584 --> 00:59:16,854
COME WHERE IT'S SAFE.

1092
00:59:21,258 --> 00:59:24,261
GOVERNOR ENGLER'S
GONNA BE SIGNING A BAN
IN A COUPLE OF MONTHS.

1093
00:59:24,361 --> 00:59:28,165
IT'LL MAKE
ASSISTING A SUICIDE
A FOUR-YEAR FELONY.

1094
00:59:28,265 --> 00:59:30,835
OH. OH, THAT'S LAUGHABLE.

1095
00:59:30,935 --> 00:59:32,703
IT'S A FUCKING CHARADE,

1096
00:59:32,803 --> 00:59:35,005
AND I'LL APPEAL IT
WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT.

1097
00:59:35,105 --> 00:59:37,007
IN THE MEANTIME,
IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING
LINED UP,

1098
00:59:37,107 --> 00:59:39,710
I SUGGEST
YOU GET IT DONE PRONTO.

1099
00:59:44,682 --> 00:59:46,383
Neal:
WE'D HAVE BEEN
SHIT OUT OF LUCK

1100
00:59:46,483 --> 00:59:48,185
IF I HADN'T TRACED
THOSE TWO DOWN

1101
00:59:48,285 --> 00:59:49,620
AT A WHOLESALER
IN KALAMAZOO,

1102
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:52,356
WHERE IT JUST SO HAPPENS
AN OLD FLAME OF MINE WORKS.

1103
00:59:52,456 --> 00:59:55,359
A COUPLE OF HAPPY-HOUR
MARGARITAS SEALED THE DEAL.

1104
00:59:55,459 --> 00:59:57,261
THEN IT WAS
WORTH THE DRIVE?

1105
00:59:57,361 --> 00:59:59,964
( chuckles )
IT'S ALWAYS WORTH IT.

1106
01:00:00,064 --> 01:00:02,800
JACK, I JUST AIN'T SURE
THESE ARE GONNA BE ENOUGH.

1107
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:05,770
I'LL MAKE IT WORK.
I CAN RATION IT.

1108
01:00:06,804 --> 01:00:08,538
ANYWAY, I THINK
I'VE GOT AN IDEA,

1109
01:00:08,639 --> 01:00:10,440
A WAY TO RECAPTURE
THE GAS.

1110
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:13,577
LET'S STOP OVER
AT THE HARDWARE STORE.

1111
01:00:13,678 --> 01:00:15,545
OH, AND THAT'S--

1112
01:00:15,646 --> 01:00:20,084
I APOLOGIZE FOR PUTTING
YOU THROUGH THIS, MA'AM.

1113
01:00:20,184 --> 01:00:21,719
( wheezing coughing )

1114
01:00:24,789 --> 01:00:26,657
IT'S THE EMPHYSEMA.

1115
01:00:26,757 --> 01:00:28,625
I KNOW.
YES, I KNOW.

1116
01:00:28,726 --> 01:00:31,061
I KNOW.
WE'LL JUST WAIT
FOR IT TO PASS.

1117
01:00:31,161 --> 01:00:33,263
LET HIM HAVE
THIS ONE OUT.
GO AHEAD.

1118
01:00:33,363 --> 01:00:37,001
- ( breathing heavily )
- AND WE BREATHE.

1119
01:00:40,504 --> 01:00:42,306
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

1120
01:00:42,406 --> 01:00:43,741
OKAY, SO WE'RE--

1121
01:00:43,841 --> 01:00:45,843
I THINK WE'RE READY
FOR THE BOX FIRST.

1122
01:00:45,943 --> 01:00:47,812
LIKE I SAID
TO YOU BEFORE,

1123
01:00:47,912 --> 01:00:50,815
BECAUSE
OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES
I'M IN NOW,

1124
01:00:50,915 --> 01:00:53,951
WE HAVE TO USE THIS
BECAUSE I'M SAVING THE GAS.

1125
01:00:54,051 --> 01:00:56,620
YOU UNDERSTAND?
WE'RE GOING TO
RECAPTURE THE GAS.

1126
01:00:56,721 --> 01:00:59,690
THEY WON'T GIVE ME
MORE CANISTERS,

1127
01:00:59,790 --> 01:01:01,792
AND I HAVE
OTHER PATIENTS TO SERVE--

1128
01:01:01,892 --> 01:01:04,161
TWO OTHERS, AND I--

1129
01:01:04,261 --> 01:01:06,931
MAYBE THIS ISN'T SUCH
A GREAT IDEA, DOCTOR.

1130
01:01:07,031 --> 01:01:09,399
- I DON'T THINK
IT'S GONNA HOLD.
- I THINK IT'S GONNA BE FINE.

1131
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:10,868
WE'RE ALMOST THERE.

1132
01:01:10,968 --> 01:01:13,003
JUST A LITTLE
MORE TAPE RIGHT HERE...

1133
01:01:13,103 --> 01:01:15,906
- THERE.
- ...JUST TO KEEP IT IN.
HERE WE GO.

1134
01:01:16,006 --> 01:01:18,075
LIKE WE TALKED
ABOUT BEFORE,
ALL RIGHT?

1135
01:01:18,175 --> 01:01:21,746
WHAT WE SAID--
NEAL IS GONNA TURN ON
THE GAS CANISTER...

1136
01:01:21,846 --> 01:01:24,548
- OKAY.
- ...WHEN YOU ARE READY.

1137
01:01:24,648 --> 01:01:26,016
SO WE'RE GONNA GET
THE SIGNAL FROM YOU.

1138
01:01:26,116 --> 01:01:28,485
- YES, SIR.
- SORRY FOR THIS.

1139
01:01:28,585 --> 01:01:30,354
- THIS IS NOT USUAL--
- NO NO. NO NO.

1140
01:01:30,454 --> 01:01:32,823
THIS IS NOT USUALLY
WHAT WE DO, BUT WE'VE
RUN OUT OF LUCK HERE.

1141
01:01:32,923 --> 01:01:34,491
- IT'S OKAY.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
- OKAY.

1142
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:36,226
READY.

1143
01:01:39,229 --> 01:01:41,098
( gas hisses )

1144
01:01:43,133 --> 01:01:45,102
ALL RIGHT.

1145
01:01:45,202 --> 01:01:47,371
THANK YOU FOR
A GREAT LIFE, CHERYL.

1146
01:01:47,471 --> 01:01:49,974
Cheryl:
YOU TOO.

1147
01:01:54,411 --> 01:01:55,980
( gas hissing )

1148
01:01:58,648 --> 01:02:01,185
YOU'RE SO BRAVE.

1149
01:02:12,797 --> 01:02:14,498
WAIT. TAKE--
TAKE IT OFF.

1150
01:02:14,598 --> 01:02:16,166
TAKE-- TAKE IT OFF.

1151
01:02:16,266 --> 01:02:19,603
- TAKE IT OFF.
TAKE IT OFF.
- ( hissing stops )

1152
01:02:19,703 --> 01:02:21,138
- GETTING HOT.
- HOT?

1153
01:02:21,238 --> 01:02:23,573
- WATCH HIS--
WATCH HIS--
- HOT. OH.

1154
01:02:23,673 --> 01:02:25,109
- GETTING SO HOT.
- IT'S WHAT?

1155
01:02:25,209 --> 01:02:27,644
- GETTING SO HOT. HOT.
- HOT.

1156
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:32,082
- HE'S BURNING UP.
- OKAY, MAYBE WE--
THIS HAS GOT TO WAIT.

1157
01:02:32,182 --> 01:02:34,184
- OH, I THINK SO.
- NO NO, PLEASE.

1158
01:02:34,284 --> 01:02:36,253
I WASN'T--
I WASN'T PREPARED
FOR THE ISSUE.

1159
01:02:36,353 --> 01:02:39,489
- I'M AWFULLY SORRY. SO LET'S--
- IT'S ALL RIGHT, DOC.

1160
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:42,860
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
NOW, PLEASE.

1161
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:47,097
DO IT NOW, PLEASE.
( wheezes ) DO IT.

1162
01:02:49,699 --> 01:02:51,802
OKAY, LET'S DO IT
THIS WAY.

1163
01:02:51,902 --> 01:02:54,571
YOU KNOW,
LET'S GET RID OF THAT.

1164
01:02:54,671 --> 01:02:58,075
JUST-- LET'S JUST
PUT THE BOX ON.
IT'D BE BETTER.

1165
01:02:58,175 --> 01:03:02,046
THIS IS GONNA
BE EASIER, HUGH.

1166
01:03:02,146 --> 01:03:04,314
- THIS--
- WATCH YOUR HEAD.

1167
01:03:04,414 --> 01:03:06,650
- DOWN.
- OKAY.

1168
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:08,318
- WATCH YOUR HEAD.
- Jack: HERE IT IS.

1169
01:03:08,418 --> 01:03:10,120
- Neal: MIND YOUR HEAD.
- Jack: MIND YOUR HEAD.

1170
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:11,889
JUST PUSH IT--
THAT'S IT. THAT'S FINE.

1171
01:03:11,989 --> 01:03:15,059
THIS IS GONNA
BE EASIER NOW,

1172
01:03:15,159 --> 01:03:19,296
BECAUSE THE GAS WILL
ESCAPE NOW.

1173
01:03:19,396 --> 01:03:21,665
IT WON'T HEAT UP.

1174
01:03:21,765 --> 01:03:25,169
JUST LIKE THAT,
HUGH. OKAY? OKAY?

1175
01:03:25,269 --> 01:03:27,804
NOW AIR IS GONNA GET THROUGH,
SO YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

1176
01:03:27,905 --> 01:03:29,706
YOU'RE NOT GONNA HEAT UP.

1177
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:31,475
LET ME JUST GET THIS.

1178
01:03:31,575 --> 01:03:34,211
HERE WE ARE.

1179
01:03:37,014 --> 01:03:39,950
OKAY. ONCE AGAIN,
WHEN YOU'RE READY, HUGH,

1180
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:42,419
WE'LL HAVE NEAL TURN
THE GAS ON AGAIN.

1181
01:03:42,519 --> 01:03:44,821
I LOVE YOU, DARLING.

1182
01:03:44,922 --> 01:03:46,656
- I LOVE YOU.
- I LOVE YOU.

1183
01:03:46,756 --> 01:03:50,594
( crying )
IT'S OKAY, DARLING.

1184
01:03:52,496 --> 01:03:54,431
( gas hisses )

1185
01:03:58,102 --> 01:04:00,204
- Hugh: YOU--
- Woman: I LOVE YOU.

1186
01:04:09,113 --> 01:04:12,249
- ( clip clatters )
- Woman: OH GOD.

1187
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:15,052
- ( crying )
- ( gas hissing )

1188
01:04:17,922 --> 01:04:20,457
I LOVE YOU.

1189
01:04:20,557 --> 01:04:22,592
I LOVE YOU,
DARLING.

1190
01:04:23,928 --> 01:04:26,096
I LOVE YOU.

1191
01:04:27,364 --> 01:04:29,934
( crying )

1192
01:04:41,745 --> 01:04:43,647
( whispers )
HE'S GONE, MY DEAR.

1193
01:05:00,797 --> 01:05:03,533
I'M GONNA TYPE OUT
THE FINAL ACTION REPORT.

1194
01:05:03,633 --> 01:05:05,435
AND GIVE IT
TO YOU TOMORROW.

1195
01:05:15,812 --> 01:05:18,082
GOD!

1196
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:22,886
SO YOU EVER GONNA
SAY ANYTHING?

1197
01:05:22,987 --> 01:05:26,690
BECAUSE NOTHING IRKS
ME MORE THAN HAVING YOU
SITTING THERE SIMMERING.

1198
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:29,159
GOD FORBID
I SHOULD IRK YOU.

1199
01:05:29,259 --> 01:05:31,461
WELL, JUST SPIT IT OUT.
YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING TO SAY.

1200
01:05:31,561 --> 01:05:35,065
THE GREAT JACK KEVORKIAN.
YOU KNOW BETTER.

1201
01:05:35,165 --> 01:05:37,934
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- NOTHING GETS IN THE WAY
OF THE MISSION.

1202
01:05:38,035 --> 01:05:39,869
THE MISSION?
WHAT MISSION.

1203
01:05:39,970 --> 01:05:42,739
IS THAT WHAT
YOU CALL RATIONING,

1204
01:05:42,839 --> 01:05:46,343
TAPING A FUCKING
SHEET OF PLASTIC AROUND
A POOR GUY'S HEAD?

1205
01:05:46,443 --> 01:05:49,479
WE SHOULD'VE WAITED
TILL WE HAD MORE GAS.

1206
01:05:49,579 --> 01:05:54,184
- OH, AND WHEN WOULD
THAT HAVE BEEN I WONDER?
- I SHOULD'VE INSISTED.

1207
01:05:54,284 --> 01:05:56,987
HE WAS-- HE WAS--
HE WAS-- HE WAS DONE.

1208
01:05:57,087 --> 01:05:59,223
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
HE WANTED IT DONE.

1209
01:05:59,323 --> 01:06:01,658
HE WAS BEGGING FOR IT.
WE WANTED TO GO.

1210
01:06:01,758 --> 01:06:03,994
WE WERE READY TO GO.
HE WAS BEGGING US TO STAY.

1211
01:06:04,094 --> 01:06:06,663
HE WANTED IT DONE.
YOU SAW THAT.

1212
01:06:06,763 --> 01:06:09,766
YEAH, I SAW IT.
IT FREAKED THE SHIT
OUT OF ME.

1213
01:06:09,866 --> 01:06:13,370
WELL, IT WORKED OUT.

1214
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:15,405
IT GOT DONE.

1215
01:06:16,673 --> 01:06:18,375
I KNEW IT WOULD.

1216
01:06:22,279 --> 01:06:24,481
WE CAN'T BE CUTTING
CORNERS ANYMORE.

1217
01:06:24,581 --> 01:06:26,283
THIS ISN'T THE OLD DAYS.

1218
01:06:26,383 --> 01:06:28,718
WE'RE NOT DOWN IN THE LAB
WINGING IT ANYMORE.

1219
01:06:34,324 --> 01:06:37,261
JACK, THE NEXT TIME
IT DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT,

1220
01:06:37,361 --> 01:06:39,263
CALL IT OFF.

1221
01:06:43,167 --> 01:06:45,902
THESE ARE
MY DECISIONS
TO MAKE, NEAL.

1222
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:49,139
MINE ALONE.

1223
01:06:50,307 --> 01:06:53,743
YES, SIR, KEMO SABE.

1224
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:56,046
( typewriter clicking )

1225
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:13,063
THIS IS THE ONE WE GOT

1226
01:07:13,163 --> 01:07:15,031
THROUGH THE SEARCH WARRANT
AT KEVORKIAN'S,

1227
01:07:15,132 --> 01:07:17,934
AND YOU CAN SEE WHERE
HE'S WHITED OUT A NUMBER
OF LINES AND TYPED OVER.

1228
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:20,737
AND THIS IS THE ONE FOUND
IN NICOL'S TRASH

1229
01:07:20,837 --> 01:07:23,073
BY A CONCERNED ACTIVIST.

1230
01:07:23,173 --> 01:07:25,542
MR. GALE'S DESPERATE PLEAS
TO TAKE OFF HIS GAS MASK

1231
01:07:25,642 --> 01:07:27,477
WERE DELETED AND REPLACED
WITH THE PHRASE...

1232
01:07:27,577 --> 01:07:30,147
"PATIENT BECAME FLUSHED,
AGITATED. BREATHING DEEPLY."

1233
01:07:30,247 --> 01:07:32,482
"INCREASED RATE
OF RESPIRATION
AND MUSCLE TENSION

1234
01:07:32,582 --> 01:07:35,885
- WITH NO OVERACTION."
- THIS DIRECTLY CONTRADICTS

1235
01:07:35,985 --> 01:07:39,089
- MR. NICOL'S
PHOTOCOPIED VERSION...
- "SAYING 'TAKE IT OFF.'"

1236
01:07:39,189 --> 01:07:43,193
...AND SUGGESTS THAT
DR. KEVORKIAN WAS ATTEMPTING
TO COVER SOMETHING UP.

1237
01:07:43,293 --> 01:07:45,829
"SAYING 'TAKE IT OFF'
ONCE AGAIN,

1238
01:07:45,929 --> 01:07:47,497
HE FELL
INTO UNCONSCIOUSNESS."

1239
01:07:47,597 --> 01:07:50,734
THE TRAGEDY IS
THAT MR. GALE DID NOT
WANT TO DIE THAT DAY,

1240
01:07:50,834 --> 01:07:52,068
BUT DR. KEVORKIAN
DIDN'T CARE.

1241
01:07:52,169 --> 01:07:55,139
AN INQUEST WILL BE HELD.

1242
01:07:55,239 --> 01:07:56,940
Thompson:
HE LIED IN HIS REPORT!

1243
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:58,675
Fieger:
HE IS THE MOST
HONEST MAN I KNOW.

1244
01:07:58,775 --> 01:08:03,780
- HONEST TO A FAULT!
- Man: COULD WE CONTINUE
PLEASE?

1245
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:08,218
MR. NICOL,
WHEN MR. GALE SAID,
"TAKE IT OFF"--

1246
01:08:08,318 --> 01:08:10,120
HE WAS TALKING
ABOUT THE PLASTIC TENT

1247
01:08:10,220 --> 01:08:13,490
ON HIS HEAD,
NOT THE GAS MASK.

1248
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:17,727
AND HIS LUNGS LOCKED UP.
THAT HAPPENS WITH EMPHYSEMA.

1249
01:08:17,827 --> 01:08:19,363
THEN WHY WOULD
DR. KEVORKIAN

1250
01:08:19,463 --> 01:08:21,365
FEEL THE NEED
TO CORRECT--

1251
01:08:21,465 --> 01:08:23,867
YOU'RE GRASPING
AT STRAWS HERE.

1252
01:08:26,203 --> 01:08:30,140
IT WAS A SIMPLE
TYPOGRAPHICAL ERROR,

1253
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:32,008
WHICH I HAD
POINTED OUT TO HIM

1254
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:33,710
AND HE CORRECTED.

1255
01:08:33,810 --> 01:08:37,247
HE TYPED UP A NEW COPY
WHICH WAS GOING TO GO
IN OUR RECORDS.

1256
01:08:37,347 --> 01:08:38,682
BEFORE YOU RANSACKED
HIS APARTMENT!

1257
01:08:38,782 --> 01:08:41,218
BUT THIS TYPO,
IN ITS ORIGINAL,
WAS FOUR LINES LONG.

1258
01:08:41,318 --> 01:08:45,155
WHY WOULDN'T HE JUST
RIP IT UP AND START AGAIN
IF IT WAS A MISTAKE?

1259
01:08:47,257 --> 01:08:49,626
TO SAVE ON PAPER.

1260
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:52,562
DR. KEVORKIAN IS

1261
01:08:52,662 --> 01:08:54,764
INCREDIBLY CHEAP.

1262
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:59,569
IT WAS
A VERY EMOTIONAL DAY,

1263
01:08:59,669 --> 01:09:02,239
AS THEY ALL ARE.

1264
01:09:02,339 --> 01:09:04,174
AND I'M SURE
WHEN HE TYPED IT UP,

1265
01:09:04,274 --> 01:09:05,575
IT WAS IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT

1266
01:09:05,675 --> 01:09:07,877
AND HE WAS TRYING
TO DO THREE THINGS AT ONCE

1267
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:09,913
LIKE HE ALWAYS DOES.

1268
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:14,784
MRS. GALE, PLEASE,

1269
01:09:14,884 --> 01:09:17,721
FOR YOUR HUSBAND'S SAKE,

1270
01:09:18,822 --> 01:09:20,690
THE TRUTH.

1271
01:09:23,860 --> 01:09:25,295
( clears throat )

1272
01:09:25,395 --> 01:09:30,166
MY HUSBAND OF 22 YEARS

1273
01:09:30,267 --> 01:09:33,837
FACED DEATH SO MANY TIMES
FROM HIS SEIZURES,

1274
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:38,007
HE USED TO PRAY
NOT TO WAKE UP.

1275
01:09:38,107 --> 01:09:40,043
HE TALKED
ABOUT SHOOTING HIMSELF,

1276
01:09:40,143 --> 01:09:43,813
BUT HE DIDN'T
WANT TO LEAVE ME
THE MESS TO CLEAN UP.

1277
01:09:47,251 --> 01:09:50,854
SO HERE'S YOUR TRUTH,
MR. THOMPSON.

1278
01:09:52,121 --> 01:09:54,558
AS SICK AS HUGH WAS,

1279
01:09:54,658 --> 01:09:57,160
I BEGGED HIM
NOT TO MAKE THE CALL.

1280
01:09:57,261 --> 01:09:59,563
I BEGGED HIM EVERY NIGHT
FOR NINE MONTHS.

1281
01:10:00,464 --> 01:10:02,566
AND THEN BEFORE CHRISTMAS,

1282
01:10:02,666 --> 01:10:06,169
I ASKED HIM WHAT
HE WANTED FOR A GIFT--

1283
01:10:06,270 --> 01:10:08,605
THE LAST GIFT
I'D EVER GIVE HIM--

1284
01:10:13,109 --> 01:10:16,780
AND HE SAID,
"THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
YOU CAN GET ME, SWEETHEART.

1285
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:21,518
IT'S AN APPOINTMENT
WITH DR. KEVORKIAN."

1286
01:10:28,592 --> 01:10:31,328
I FIND NO FACTUAL BASIS
TO PROCEED.

1287
01:10:33,430 --> 01:10:35,965
- ( jazz music playing )
- ( people vocalizing )

1288
01:10:43,106 --> 01:10:45,542
- ( people chatting )
- Fieger: EXONERATED ONCE AGAIN.

1289
01:10:45,642 --> 01:10:48,745
JACK, 15;
THOMPSON, ZILCH.

1290
01:10:48,845 --> 01:10:52,616
WOW. NO WONDER
EVERYONE'S DRINKING
AT THIS SHOW.

1291
01:10:52,716 --> 01:10:54,183
( Margo laughs )

1292
01:10:54,284 --> 01:10:56,620
IS THAT SANTA CLAUS
STEPPING ON A BABY?

1293
01:10:56,720 --> 01:11:00,924
- YES.
- Janet: TELL ME ABOUT
DOC'S CHRISTMASES.

1294
01:11:01,024 --> 01:11:03,226
IT LOOKS QUITE MORBID--

1295
01:11:03,327 --> 01:11:05,261
WELL, EXCEPT FOR
THE FLOWER THAT IS.

1296
01:11:05,362 --> 01:11:07,697
THANK GOD
I'M NOT A SHRINK.

1297
01:11:07,797 --> 01:11:12,302
Margo:
OUR GRANDPARENTS,
OUR AUNTS, OUR UNCLES,

1298
01:11:12,402 --> 01:11:16,105
THE ARMENIAN HOLOCAUST WAS
THE SAME AS THE JEWS.

1299
01:11:16,205 --> 01:11:19,008
ONLY OUR PARENTS--
BARELY TEENAGERS--

1300
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:20,877
WERE ABLE TO FLEE.

1301
01:11:20,977 --> 01:11:24,581
GROWING UP, ALL WE HEARD
WERE THOSE TERRIBLE STORIES
OF ALL THE BLOODSHED,

1302
01:11:24,681 --> 01:11:28,318
AND IT FRIGHTENED JACK SO.

1303
01:11:28,418 --> 01:11:33,323
IT'S ALL DEALING
WITH THE MELANCHOLY
AGE-OLD STRUGGLE

1304
01:11:33,423 --> 01:11:36,393
BETWEEN WARMTH OF LIFE,
THE ICINESS OF DEATH.

1305
01:11:36,493 --> 01:11:40,196
ONLY I'M SURE THAT THEME
WOULD BE BETTER SERVED

1306
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:42,899
HAD A REAL ARTIST DONE IT.

1307
01:11:42,999 --> 01:11:45,068
Margo:
MANY NIGHTS HE WOULD
JUST SIT IN HIS BED--

1308
01:11:45,168 --> 01:11:47,236
LIGHTS ON A MUST--
YOU KNOW,

1309
01:11:47,337 --> 01:11:49,305
CLUTCHING THAT
LITTLE DOG OF OURS
SO TIGHTLY.

1310
01:11:49,406 --> 01:11:51,941
WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.
HE HAD A DOG?

1311
01:11:52,041 --> 01:11:53,743
YOU'RE LOOKING
SO INTENTLY.

1312
01:11:53,843 --> 01:11:55,612
- YES.
- WHAT ARE YOU FEELING?
THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE TO KNOW.

1313
01:11:55,712 --> 01:11:58,415
- JACK, IT'S, UH-- IT'S--
- IT'S, UH--

1314
01:11:58,515 --> 01:11:59,983
- HI.
- HI.

1315
01:12:00,083 --> 01:12:01,818
- IT'S, UM--
- I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE FEELING.

1316
01:12:01,918 --> 01:12:03,687
YOU'RE FEELING
IT'S-- IT'S MACABRE.

1317
01:12:03,787 --> 01:12:05,622
Stan:
IT IS MACABRE,
MY FRIEND.

1318
01:12:05,722 --> 01:12:07,323
Jack:
YES, BUT YOU'RE LOOKING
AT IT NONETHELESS.

1319
01:12:07,424 --> 01:12:10,326
IT'S LIKE WAR.
WAR, YOU'RE DRAWN TO IT,

1320
01:12:10,427 --> 01:12:14,664
BUT AFTER YOU'VE
BEEN THROUGH IT, YOU SAY,
"OH, THAT WAS GROTESQUE,

1321
01:12:14,764 --> 01:12:17,801
MACABRE,
STRANGE, UGLY."

1322
01:12:17,901 --> 01:12:20,203
THAT'S THE FEELING
I'M TRYING TO CONVEY.

1323
01:12:20,303 --> 01:12:22,639
- I'M SOLD.
- I HEARD "SOLD."

1324
01:12:22,739 --> 01:12:26,476
- HOW MUCH, JACK?
- WHATEVER YOU THINK IS FAIR.

1325
01:12:26,576 --> 01:12:29,779
- MY PATIENTS
THANK YOU IN ADVANCE.
- GOOD.

1326
01:12:29,879 --> 01:12:31,815
THIS IS FROM
MY PRIVATE COLLECTION.

1327
01:12:42,459 --> 01:12:44,494
( phone ringing )

1328
01:12:59,175 --> 01:13:00,644
HELLO.

1329
01:13:00,744 --> 01:13:02,612
Man:
Dr. Kevorkian,
I'm afraid we have

1330
01:13:02,712 --> 01:13:06,315
some bad news
regarding your sister.

1331
01:13:06,416 --> 01:13:07,584
IT APPEARS SHE HAD
THE HEART ATTACK

1332
01:13:07,684 --> 01:13:10,086
A COUPLE OF HOURS
BEFORE SHE CALLED 9-1-1.

1333
01:13:10,186 --> 01:13:14,724
PERHAPS SHE THOUGHT
THAT WHATEVER IT WAS,
IT WOULD JUST PASS.

1334
01:13:16,726 --> 01:13:18,895
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY
FOR YOUR LOSS.

1335
01:13:32,341 --> 01:13:34,544
WOULDN'T YOU LIKE
TO SEE HER?

1336
01:13:39,883 --> 01:13:41,551
( whispers ) NO.

1337
01:13:42,652 --> 01:13:44,821
( flute playing )

1338
01:13:53,630 --> 01:13:56,399
Jack:
"BY LATE,
MUCH TOO OFTEN DECEIVED,

1339
01:13:56,500 --> 01:14:00,003
BY TOO EARLY A DEATH
NOW RELIEVED

1340
01:14:00,103 --> 01:14:02,005
OF THE BURDEN SHE BORE,

1341
01:14:02,105 --> 01:14:04,307
MY SIS MARGO GAVE MORE

1342
01:14:04,407 --> 01:14:07,511
TO MY LIFE
THAN SHE EVER RECEIVED."

1343
01:14:21,725 --> 01:14:23,326
The whole question
of death and dying

1344
01:14:23,426 --> 01:14:26,696
involves the most profound
and complex ethical questions

1345
01:14:26,796 --> 01:14:28,665
that we must decide
as a society.

1346
01:14:28,765 --> 01:14:30,700
At no time have
the people of Michigan

1347
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:34,070
or the Michigan Legislature
granted Jack Kevorkian

1348
01:14:34,170 --> 01:14:36,472
or any other individual
the sole right

1349
01:14:36,573 --> 01:14:38,808
to decide who lives
or dies in our state.

1350
01:14:38,908 --> 01:14:41,611
- THANK YOU.
- THANK YOU, GOVERNOR.
CONGRATULATIONS.

1351
01:14:41,711 --> 01:14:43,647
OVER HERE.
JUST BRING IT
RIGHT OVER HERE.

1352
01:14:43,747 --> 01:14:45,949
- WE'RE GOING TO SAVE
SOME OF THAT STUFF.
- ( honking )

1353
01:14:46,049 --> 01:14:48,184
- ( men chatting )
- ( silent )

1354
01:14:48,284 --> 01:14:50,319
WE ALL
SUPPORT YOU, JACK.

1355
01:14:50,419 --> 01:14:52,355
OH, THANKS, FELLAS.
THANK YOU.

1356
01:14:52,455 --> 01:14:53,957
- COULD I?
- OH YEAH.

1357
01:14:54,057 --> 01:14:57,360
- ( honking )
- JIMMY! YEAH, GIVE ME
A HAND HERE.

1358
01:14:57,460 --> 01:14:59,195
I'M SIGNING
AN AUTOGRAPH!

1359
01:14:59,295 --> 01:15:03,266
- OKAY? WAIT A MINUTE.
- * GONNA GRAB ME A PLANE

1360
01:15:03,366 --> 01:15:09,272
* THAT'LL TAKE ME
BACK HOME TO MY FOLKS... *

1361
01:15:09,372 --> 01:15:11,274
( geese honking )

1362
01:15:11,374 --> 01:15:13,977
* MAYBE REAL SOON...

1363
01:15:14,077 --> 01:15:15,645
( engine stops )

1364
01:15:15,745 --> 01:15:20,850
* JUST AS SOON AS I GET
A FEW DOLLARS AHEAD... *

1365
01:15:20,950 --> 01:15:23,119
I GOT IT IN A SETTLEMENT
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO.

1366
01:15:23,219 --> 01:15:25,521
IT BEATS THE HELL OUT
OF YOUR APARTMENT.

1367
01:15:25,622 --> 01:15:28,792
- ( chuckles )
- A LAKE.

1368
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:32,629
- ( geese honking )
- OH!

1369
01:15:33,697 --> 01:15:37,567
- GEESE?
- YEAH. ( chuckles )

1370
01:15:37,667 --> 01:15:40,469
WELL, IT IS A BIT
ROMANTIC FOR MY TASTE.

1371
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:44,540
WELL, SUE ME FOR TRYING
TO PUT A GODDAMN ROOF
OVER YOUR HEAD, JACK.

1372
01:15:44,641 --> 01:15:47,476
- WELL--
- I'M NOT LETTING
YOU LIVE IN SOME Y.M.C.A.

1373
01:15:47,577 --> 01:15:49,579
- COME ON.
- FINE.

1374
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:51,881
ONLY I HAVEN'T
TAKEN THIS YET.

1375
01:15:51,981 --> 01:15:55,251
AND IF I DO,
I'M PAYING THE RENT.

1376
01:15:56,352 --> 01:15:58,588
NO CHARITY CASE.

1377
01:15:59,589 --> 01:16:01,224
OKAY, I'LL TAKE IT.

1378
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:03,893
OKAY. GEOFF?

1379
01:16:03,993 --> 01:16:05,662
- YEAH?
- LET'S GO.

1380
01:16:05,762 --> 01:16:09,232
LET'S GO.
DON'T YOU HAVE WORK
TO GET BACK TO?

1381
01:16:09,332 --> 01:16:11,334
LIKE WHAT?

1382
01:16:11,434 --> 01:16:13,136
"LIKE WHAT?"

1383
01:16:13,236 --> 01:16:16,773
LIKE APPEALING
THE 15-MONTH BAN
THAT'S TYING MY HANDS.

1384
01:16:16,873 --> 01:16:18,975
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND, JACK?

1385
01:16:19,075 --> 01:16:22,478
THEY MADE A LAW
SPECIFICALLY TO STOP ME.

1386
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:24,580
- I WANT TO CHALLENGE IT.
- ( paper rustling )

1387
01:16:24,681 --> 01:16:26,582
I WANT TO TEST IT.

1388
01:16:28,017 --> 01:16:29,152
WHAT IS THIS?

1389
01:16:29,252 --> 01:16:33,156
THOMAS HYDE,
30 YEARS OLD,

1390
01:16:33,256 --> 01:16:35,759
LOU GEHRIG'S DISEASE.

1391
01:16:35,859 --> 01:16:37,794
OH.

1392
01:16:39,495 --> 01:16:41,731
ARE YOU GONNA GO ALONG
WITH ME ON THIS?

1393
01:16:42,832 --> 01:16:44,768
I'M WITH YOU, JACK.

1394
01:16:44,868 --> 01:16:47,871
- ( grunts )
- Jack: Okay,
don't strain too much.

1395
01:16:47,971 --> 01:16:49,538
Don't strain.
Don't strain.

1396
01:16:49,639 --> 01:16:52,375
- Ah!
- He's gonna get
a cramp here?

1397
01:16:52,475 --> 01:16:56,345
Does he? Yes.
All right, that's enough
of the physical stuff, Tom.

1398
01:16:56,445 --> 01:17:00,850
NO MORE PHYSICAL.
I JUST WANTED YOU TO MOVE
A LITTLE FOR THE RECORD.

1399
01:17:01,685 --> 01:17:04,754
So now, Tom, tell me:

1400
01:17:04,854 --> 01:17:06,055
What is it you wish?

1401
01:17:06,155 --> 01:17:08,357
In plain English.

1402
01:17:37,754 --> 01:17:39,355
( camera clicks )

1403
01:17:45,461 --> 01:17:47,130
( clears throat )

1404
01:17:47,230 --> 01:17:49,933
BOND IS SET FOR $50,000.
ARE YOU GONNA PAY THAT TODAY?

1405
01:17:50,033 --> 01:17:51,534
OH, THAT IS
BEYOND EGREGIOUS,
YOUR HONOR.

1406
01:17:51,634 --> 01:17:54,603
THAT IS NO WAY
I'M GOING TO PAY A BOND
LIKE THAT, YOUR HONOR.

1407
01:17:54,704 --> 01:17:57,140
YOU CAN FORGET IT.
YOU CAN FORGET IT,

1408
01:17:57,240 --> 01:17:59,075
- BECAUSE THIS IS
THE LAST TIME...
- Fieger: JACK.

1409
01:17:59,175 --> 01:18:02,311
...YOU PEOPLE
UNJUSTLY TAKE AWAY
FROM ME MY LIBERTIES.

1410
01:18:02,411 --> 01:18:04,547
- I NEED A MOMENT WITH
MY CLIENT, YOUR HONOR.
- THE LAST TIME.

1411
01:18:04,647 --> 01:18:07,216
AND I WILL NOT--
HEAR ME NOW-- I WILL NOT EAT.

1412
01:18:07,316 --> 01:18:09,052
- JACK.
- GUARANTEED.

1413
01:18:09,152 --> 01:18:11,087
- I APOLOGIZE FOR MY CLIENT.
- YOU ARE ASSISTING
IN MY SUICIDE.

1414
01:18:11,187 --> 01:18:14,223
( whispers )
PLEASE. JACK JACK JACK,
JUST COME ON.

1415
01:18:14,323 --> 01:18:16,225
( door buzzes )

1416
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:19,362
( doors clanging )

1417
01:18:29,438 --> 01:18:31,707
Fieger:
JACK, THIS IS BETTER
THAN I COULD'VE IMAGINED.

1418
01:18:31,808 --> 01:18:34,043
EVERY PAPER IS
TREATING YOU AS A VICTIM.

1419
01:18:36,279 --> 01:18:39,648
DON'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT PAYING MY BOND.

1420
01:18:39,749 --> 01:18:42,685
- LET 'EM CONVICT ME.
- YOU'RE NOT GETTING
CONVICTED ON MY WATCH.

1421
01:18:42,786 --> 01:18:45,021
HERE, JACK.
COME ON.

1422
01:18:45,121 --> 01:18:48,024
- Jack: HUH?
- HAVE A BAZOOKA.

1423
01:18:50,626 --> 01:18:53,529
- BAZOOKA?
- NO, IT IS NOT CHEATING.

1424
01:18:53,629 --> 01:18:54,998
IT'S JUST
A LITTLE APPLE JUICE.

1425
01:18:55,098 --> 01:18:57,300
I PUT SOME
VITAMIN DROPS IN,
THAT'S ALL.

1426
01:18:57,400 --> 01:18:58,802
GO AHEAD.

1427
01:18:58,902 --> 01:19:01,070
- VITAMIN DROPS?
- YUMMY. THERE YOU GO.

1428
01:19:01,170 --> 01:19:04,240
I'VE SEEN YOU
BEFORE, HAVEN'T I?
WHAT THE HELL IS IN THERE?

1429
01:19:04,340 --> 01:19:06,609
YOU'VE SEEN
BETTER DAYS, DOC.
JUST DRINK IT DOWN.

1430
01:19:06,709 --> 01:19:09,378
- I SURE HAVE.
- ( chuckles )

1431
01:19:09,478 --> 01:19:11,214
THAT'S IT.

1432
01:19:11,314 --> 01:19:13,416
MMM.

1433
01:19:16,085 --> 01:19:18,187
THAT'S SWEET
OF YOU, JANET.

1434
01:19:18,287 --> 01:19:20,223
- OH, MY PLEASURE, DOC.
- SHARE SOME WITH ME.

1435
01:19:20,323 --> 01:19:23,793
NO NO NO, YOU HAVE IT.
I'M ON THE WAGON.

1436
01:19:23,893 --> 01:19:26,495
- ( chuckles )
- ( door buzzes )

1437
01:19:29,032 --> 01:19:32,335
- "BECAUSE IT'S"--
- ( door clangs )

1438
01:19:32,435 --> 01:19:34,403
- "BECAUSE IT'S"--
- ( door clangs )

1439
01:19:35,839 --> 01:19:38,774
WHAT'S THIS?
I KNOW THIS.

1440
01:19:38,875 --> 01:19:40,743
I KNOW THIS WELL.

1441
01:19:40,844 --> 01:19:42,812
WHY CAN'T I--

1442
01:19:42,912 --> 01:19:46,349
"BECAUSE IT IS MY NAME."

1443
01:19:46,449 --> 01:19:47,783
"BECAUSE IT IS"--

1444
01:19:47,884 --> 01:19:49,585
Jack's voice:
"...MY SOUL."

1445
01:19:49,685 --> 01:19:51,520
"BECAUSE IT"--

1446
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:52,889
HOW COULD
I NOT KNOW THAT?

1447
01:19:52,989 --> 01:19:55,224
"BECAUSE IT IS MY NAME.

1448
01:19:55,324 --> 01:19:57,827
- BECAUSE I CANNOT HAVE"--

"BECAUSE I CANNOT HAVE
ANOTHER IN MY--

1450

BECAUSE I CANNOT HAVE
ANOTHER IN MY LIFE."

- "BECAUSE IT IS MY NAME."
- ( door buzzes )

1452
01:20:04,067 --> 01:20:05,701
"I HAVE GIVEN YOU...

1453
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:07,770
MY LIFE."

1454
01:20:07,871 --> 01:20:09,205
"I'VE GIVEN YOU MY LIFE."

1455
01:20:09,305 --> 01:20:10,706
"BECAUSE I WOULD--

1456
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:12,375
BECAUSE I WOULD"--
NO NO NO.

- "BECAUSE I--
I CANNOT HAVE"--
- ( door buzzes )

1458

"I CANNOT--
I CANNOT HAVE
ANOTHER IN MY LIFE."

( door buzzes )

1463
01:20:29,893 --> 01:20:32,862
"HOW MAY I LIVE
WITHOUT MY NAME?"

1464
01:20:33,930 --> 01:20:36,232
"I'VE GIVEN YOU
MY SOUL."

1465
01:20:40,736 --> 01:20:42,405
MARGO.

1466
01:20:43,472 --> 01:20:45,141
MARGO.

1467
01:20:46,542 --> 01:20:48,477
YOU WERE RIGHT.

1468
01:20:50,313 --> 01:20:52,215
IT'S NICER.

1469
01:20:53,749 --> 01:20:56,019
IT IS NICER.

1470
01:20:56,119 --> 01:20:58,487
OH.
( mumbling )

1471
01:21:04,393 --> 01:21:06,862
"BECAUSE IT IS--
BECAUSE IT IS--

1472
01:21:06,963 --> 01:21:09,398
BECAUSE IT IS MY--

1473
01:21:09,498 --> 01:21:11,400
BECAUSE IT IS"--

1474
01:21:20,309 --> 01:21:22,245
( chatting )

1475
01:21:25,848 --> 01:21:27,350
Jackson:
IT'S BEEN 19 DAYS.

1476
01:21:27,450 --> 01:21:29,785
I'M GRANTING
MR. FIEGER'S REQUEST

1477
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:31,554
TO REDUCE
YOUR BOND TO $100.

1478
01:21:31,654 --> 01:21:33,889
- THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.
- ( people whispering )

1479
01:21:35,959 --> 01:21:38,527
( whispers )
IF YOU WANT
TO FIRE ME, GO AHEAD.

1480
01:21:46,302 --> 01:21:48,471
Jack on TV:
So is there anything else

1481
01:21:48,571 --> 01:21:51,907
you wish to add, Tom,
or have Heidi tell us?

1482
01:21:52,008 --> 01:21:54,377
Or, Heidi, is there
anything you would add

1483
01:21:54,477 --> 01:21:56,946
before we conclude
this discussion?

1484
01:22:04,988 --> 01:22:07,323
( both crying )

1485
01:22:14,030 --> 01:22:16,032
I'm sorry, honey.

1486
01:22:16,132 --> 01:22:19,602
That's all
I wanted to say.

1487
01:22:19,702 --> 01:22:22,171
It's too much for us.

1488
01:22:24,007 --> 01:22:25,874
( crowd chanting )
JAIL JACK!
JAIL JACK!

1489
01:22:25,975 --> 01:22:28,077
JAIL JACK! JAIL JACK!

1490
01:22:28,177 --> 01:22:30,313
JAIL JACK!
JAIL JACK!

1491
01:22:30,413 --> 01:22:33,749
JAIL JACK!
JAIL JACK! JAIL JACK!

1492
01:22:33,849 --> 01:22:35,284
- ( reporters speaking )
- MR. THOMPSON, WHAT HAPPENED?

1493
01:22:35,384 --> 01:22:38,454
I REMIND KEVORKIAN
THIS "NOT GUILTY" VERDICT

1494
01:22:38,554 --> 01:22:41,524
DOES NOT CHANGE
THE FACT THAT WE STILL
HAVE A BAN IN EFFECT.

1495
01:22:41,624 --> 01:22:44,193
- ( crowd shouting )
- I THINK MANKIND TOOK--

1496
01:22:44,293 --> 01:22:46,829
TOOK AN HISTORIC
STEP TODAY

1497
01:22:46,929 --> 01:22:48,297
OUT OF THE DARK AGES.

1498
01:22:48,397 --> 01:22:50,766
IT MAKES ME THINK
OF THE NUREMBERG TRIALS.

1499
01:22:50,866 --> 01:22:54,803
WHEN A LAW IS DEEMED
IMMORAL BY YOU,

1500
01:22:54,903 --> 01:22:57,873
YOU MUST DISOBEY IT.
YOU MUST DISOBEY IT.

1501
01:22:57,973 --> 01:23:00,076
- THANK YOU.
- DICK.

1502
01:23:01,744 --> 01:23:05,114
THE MAN'S INVINCIBLE.
SO AM I.

1503
01:23:05,214 --> 01:23:07,450
I JUST GOT WORD THAT
THE COURT OF APPEALS IS

1504
01:23:07,550 --> 01:23:09,318
GONNA HEAR ARGUMENTS
ON YOUR BAN!

1505
01:23:09,418 --> 01:23:12,188
HELL, I'M GONNA
WIN THAT TOO!

1506
01:23:12,288 --> 01:23:15,591
Jack:
WHY CAN'T WE HAVE
CLINICS DOING THIS STUFF?

1507
01:23:15,691 --> 01:23:17,760
EVERY CITY SHOULD
HAVE A CLINIC WHERE
SOMEONE CAN GO TO.

1508
01:23:17,860 --> 01:23:20,829
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I JUST GOT AN IDEA.
I'M GONNA HAVE ONE OF MY OWN.

1509
01:23:20,929 --> 01:23:22,798
HOW DOES IT FEEL
TO BE VICTORIOUS?

1510
01:23:22,898 --> 01:23:24,733
VICTORIOUS?
I NEVER FEEL VICTORIOUS.

1511
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:26,435
I JUST GO AHEAD
AND DO WHAT I DO.

1512
01:23:26,535 --> 01:23:29,438
THIS ISN'T
A VICTORY TO ME.
IT'S JUST COMMON SENSE.

1513
01:23:31,707 --> 01:23:34,243
Neal: YOU DON'T
NEED HARDLY NOTHING.
THE WALLS ARE GOOD.

1514
01:23:34,343 --> 01:23:36,312
Janet:
NO, THEY'RE NOT.
YOU CAN'T LEAVE IT WHITE.

1515
01:23:36,412 --> 01:23:39,248
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH WHITE?
- YOU WANT SOMETHING
THAT'S CREAM

1516
01:23:39,348 --> 01:23:41,817
OR ROBIN'S EGG BLUE.
SOMETHING THAT'S WARM.

1517
01:23:41,917 --> 01:23:44,153
SOMETHING
THAT'S PEACEFUL.

1518
01:23:44,253 --> 01:23:46,255
Jack:
SHOULD IT BE HIGHER,
YOU THINK?

1519
01:23:46,355 --> 01:23:48,524
WELL, I DON'T HAVE
ANY WINDOW NAILS ON ME
RIGHT NOW, DOC.

1520
01:23:48,624 --> 01:23:51,960
WELL, YOU KNOW,
NEAL, IT'S NOT
LIKE IT'S 500 LBS.

1521
01:23:52,061 --> 01:23:54,263
YOU JUST LIFT IT UP--
THERE IT IS.

1522
01:23:54,363 --> 01:23:56,432
- THAT LOOKS GOOD.
- ( grunts )

1523
01:23:56,532 --> 01:23:59,335
Jack:
IT'S NOT CENTERED ENOUGH,
BUT WHO CARES, RIGHT?

1524
01:23:59,435 --> 01:24:01,237
- THERE YOU GO.
- I THINK IT'S PERFECT.

1525
01:24:01,337 --> 01:24:03,339
- YUP.
- NO, I COULDN'T TELL

1526
01:24:03,439 --> 01:24:05,674
BECAUSE I'VE GOT TO GO
OUTSIDE AND SEE IT. HERE.

1527
01:24:07,610 --> 01:24:10,246
OH, YEAH.
OH, YEAH!

1528
01:24:10,346 --> 01:24:13,216
Fieger:
SO IF YOU'RE UNCONSCIOUS,
THEY HAVE THE RIGHT

1529
01:24:13,316 --> 01:24:15,851
TO TURN OFF
THE FEEDING TUBE
AND LET YOU DIE.

1530
01:24:15,951 --> 01:24:19,788
BUT IF YOU'RE
CONSCIOUS, RATIONAL

1531
01:24:19,888 --> 01:24:22,125
AND BEGGING
FOR ASSISTANCE,

1532
01:24:22,225 --> 01:24:24,493
TO BE ALLOWED TO DIE,

1533
01:24:24,593 --> 01:24:28,364
WE REFUSE. WE REFUSE.

1534
01:24:34,737 --> 01:24:38,107
NOW HOW IS IT POSSIBLE

1535
01:24:38,207 --> 01:24:41,444
THAT A MENTALLY-
COMPETENT ADULT

1536
01:24:41,544 --> 01:24:44,113
DOES NOT HAVE THE RIGHT
TO LOOK A DOCTOR IN THE EYE

1537
01:24:44,213 --> 01:24:46,482
AND SAY "I'VE HAD ENOUGH"?

1538
01:24:48,184 --> 01:24:52,087
"I CAN'T ENDURE
ANYMORE PAIN.

1539
01:24:53,422 --> 01:24:54,790
HELP ME.

1540
01:24:54,890 --> 01:24:58,427
I'VE HAD ENOUGH."

1541
01:24:58,527 --> 01:25:00,629
- ( gas hissing )
- Fieger: DO WE REALLY WANT

1542
01:25:00,729 --> 01:25:03,266
THE GOVERNMENT MAKING
THOSE DECISIONS FOR US?

1543
01:25:06,435 --> 01:25:07,903
NO.

1544
01:25:08,003 --> 01:25:10,773
IT CAN'T BE.

1545
01:25:10,873 --> 01:25:12,875
IT JUST CAN'T BE.

1546
01:25:12,975 --> 01:25:15,077
Man on TV:
In a rented storefront
in Warren,

1547
01:25:15,178 --> 01:25:17,713
Kevorkian aided
the death of a Kansas City,
Missouri, woman

1548
01:25:17,813 --> 01:25:20,115
- who had been inflicted
with Lou Gehrig's disease.
- FORGET IT. FORGET IT.

1549
01:25:20,216 --> 01:25:21,850
ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY
YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHO I WAS?

1550
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:24,553
YOU DIDN'T REALLY
THINK IT WAS GONNA BE
AN ARMENIAN BAKERY, DID YOU?

1551
01:25:24,653 --> 01:25:28,191
YOU'VE GOT
24 HOURS TO VACATE.
NOT A MINUTE MORE.

1552
01:25:28,291 --> 01:25:30,226
Neal:
IF WE CAN GET INTO
ANOTHER STORAGE UNIT--

1553
01:25:30,326 --> 01:25:32,228
NOT STORAGE UNIT,
BUT ANOTHER PLACE,

1554
01:25:32,328 --> 01:25:35,298
WE'VE GOT
A PLACE TO MOVE--

1555
01:25:35,398 --> 01:25:37,300
MOVE ALL THE CRAP
SO WE DON'T HAVE TO--

1556
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:39,335
Jack:
YOU'VE GOT TO STORE IT

1557
01:25:39,435 --> 01:25:41,570
OR THEY'RE GONNA
THROW IT OUT ON THE STREET.

1558
01:25:42,705 --> 01:25:45,541
- OH, SHOOT.
- ( doorbell rings )

1559
01:25:48,544 --> 01:25:51,447
- Neal: RAY BOY.
- Jack: THEY SHUT
US DOWN, RAY.

1560
01:25:51,547 --> 01:25:53,349
THEY JUST SHUT US DOWN.

1561
01:25:53,449 --> 01:25:55,451
YOU KNOW,
THE SAME KIND OF THING,

1562
01:25:55,551 --> 01:25:58,454
SPURRED THE '67 RIOTS,
YOU KNOW.

1563
01:25:58,554 --> 01:26:00,923
YOU REMEMBER?
OF COURSE YOU REMEMBER.
YOU WERE THERE.

1564
01:26:01,023 --> 01:26:03,826
YOU WERE A CAPTAIN,
WEREN'T YOU?

1565
01:26:04,727 --> 01:26:06,862
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

1566
01:26:09,832 --> 01:26:11,867
- OOH.
- HEY, JAN.

1567
01:26:11,967 --> 01:26:14,270
- JANNY?
- HMM?

1568
01:26:14,370 --> 01:26:18,040
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
- I'VE GOT THE CANCER,

1569
01:26:18,140 --> 01:26:20,008
PANCREATIC.

1570
01:26:20,108 --> 01:26:22,077
THEY DIAGNOSED ME
THIS MORNING.

1571
01:26:22,177 --> 01:26:24,179
THEY'VE GIVEN ME
SIX MONTHS,

1572
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:29,352
BUT I'M NOT
ROLLING OVER LIKE THAT.

1573
01:26:29,452 --> 01:26:32,388
HERE, MAKE YOURSELF USEFUL.
PUT THAT IN THE OVEN.

1574
01:26:35,258 --> 01:26:38,861
- HERE.
- OH, WHAT YOU GOT,

1575
01:26:38,961 --> 01:26:41,930
- PECAN SANDIES HERE?
- NO, IT'S CHOCOLATE CHIP.

1576
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:44,533
- HERE, HERE'S ANOTHER ONE.
- YEAH

1577
01:26:49,137 --> 01:26:51,073
SO WHAT'S NEW WITH YOU?

1578
01:26:51,173 --> 01:26:52,941
( oven door clangs )

1579
01:26:53,041 --> 01:26:55,344
THEY SHUT US DOWN,

1580
01:26:55,444 --> 01:26:58,013
SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO,

1581
01:26:58,113 --> 01:27:02,451
YOU KNOW,
FIND ANOTHER PLACE.

1582
01:27:02,551 --> 01:27:04,687
WE WILL.
WE'LL FIND
ANOTHER PLACE.

1583
01:27:04,787 --> 01:27:06,689
DON'T WORRY.

1584
01:27:11,660 --> 01:27:13,829
( distant train whistling )

1585
01:27:19,835 --> 01:27:21,770
( geese honking )

1586
01:27:26,575 --> 01:27:28,277
HEY, JACK.

1587
01:27:28,377 --> 01:27:30,579
HEY, GEOFF.

1588
01:27:32,348 --> 01:27:33,849
THEY DON'T WANT
TO EAT TODAY.

1589
01:27:38,987 --> 01:27:40,789
I'M SORRY TO HEAR
ABOUT JANET.

1590
01:27:41,824 --> 01:27:43,759
( sighs )

1591
01:27:43,859 --> 01:27:45,694
HERE.

1592
01:27:49,532 --> 01:27:51,233
THE COURT OF APPEALS'
RULING JUST CAME IN

1593
01:27:51,334 --> 01:27:53,268
AND THEY RULED
IN OUR FAVOR.

1594
01:27:53,369 --> 01:27:55,438
THEY SAID
THAT THE LAW WAS
SO POORLY WORDED

1595
01:27:55,538 --> 01:27:57,306
THAT IT COULD NOT
BE UPHELD.

1596
01:27:57,406 --> 01:27:59,942
OH. WELL,
I'M GLAD TO HEAR

1597
01:28:00,042 --> 01:28:03,646
THERE'S STILL
SOME SMART PEOPLE
IN POWER LEFT.

1598
01:28:05,180 --> 01:28:07,316
THAT WAS
THE GOOD NEWS.

1599
01:28:07,416 --> 01:28:11,019
THEY ALSO RULED THAT
THERE'S NO CONSTITUTIONAL
RIGHT TO COMMIT SUICIDE...

1600
01:28:11,119 --> 01:28:13,155
I TAKE BACK
WHAT I JUST SAID.

1601
01:28:13,255 --> 01:28:15,157
...AND THAT AIDING
IN ONE FALLS UNDER

1602
01:28:15,257 --> 01:28:17,259
AN OLD COMMON-LAW
DEFINITION OF MURDER.

1603
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:20,329
COMMON LAW?
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

1604
01:28:20,429 --> 01:28:22,565
WE'RE GONNA RETRY HIM
ON SHERRY MILLER

1605
01:28:22,665 --> 01:28:24,700
AND MARJORIE WANTZ.
THOSE TWO WEREN'T TERMINAL

1606
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:26,835
AND IT'S MY JOB
TO SEE THEY GET JUSTICE.

1607
01:28:26,935 --> 01:28:29,271
- ARE YOU REALLY CERTAIN THAT--
- I'VE GOT HIM IN MY
CROSSHAIRS NOW.

1608
01:28:29,372 --> 01:28:31,807
THE PUBLIC DOESN'T WANT
ANOTHER TRIAL.

1609
01:28:31,907 --> 01:28:34,777
FROM ALL I HEAR,
THEY'RE READY TO
TURN THE PAGE.

1610
01:28:34,877 --> 01:28:38,347
I STOPPED WORRYING
ABOUT PUBLIC PERCEPTION
A LONG TIME AGO, DAVID.

1611
01:28:39,982 --> 01:28:41,684
Man:
PUBLIC CRUSADER

1612
01:28:41,784 --> 01:28:43,752
- OR ATTENTION-
GRABBING EGOTIST?
- OKAY, JACK?

1613
01:28:43,852 --> 01:28:46,221
- I'M OKAY.
- YOU BE THE JUDGE
AS DR. JACK KEVORKIAN

1614
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:47,756
APPEARS AT THE COURTHOUSE

1615
01:28:47,856 --> 01:28:50,659
LOCKED IN AN OLD-FASHIONED
WOODEN PILLORY.

1616
01:28:50,759 --> 01:28:53,295
PROSECUTOR DICK THOMPSON
CAN ONLY HOPE HIS ROLL
OF THE DICE

1617
01:28:53,396 --> 01:28:55,764
FINALLY MUZZLES
THE MAVERICK PHYSICIAN.

1618
01:28:55,864 --> 01:28:59,267
TOP DEFENSE LAWYER
MAYER MORGANROTH HAS
HIS MONEY ON JACK.

1619
01:28:59,368 --> 01:29:02,871
- Woman: WHY THE STOCKS?
- THIS IS A CLEAR
MANIFESTATION

1620
01:29:02,971 --> 01:29:05,140
OF THE EXISTENCE

1621
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:07,443
OF THE INQUISITION
IN THE STATE.

1622
01:29:07,543 --> 01:29:12,615
MEDIEVAL PUNISHMENT
FOR A MEDIEVAL CONCEPT.

1623
01:29:12,715 --> 01:29:15,117
- THIS IS NOT A TRIAL.
- Thompson: YOUR HONOR, PLEAS.

1624
01:29:15,217 --> 01:29:18,353
WHAT LAW HAVE
I BROKEN? TELL ME.
WHAT LAW HAVE I BROKEN?

1625
01:29:18,454 --> 01:29:21,657
SOME ANTIQUATED
COMMON LAWS.
COMMON LAW.

1626
01:29:21,757 --> 01:29:23,526
- DO YOU KNOW THAT
IT'S A CRIME...
- YOU HONOR--

1627
01:29:23,626 --> 01:29:25,828
...TO CONVERT FROM
CHRISTIANITY TO ISLAM?

1628
01:29:25,928 --> 01:29:28,296
- DID YOU KNOW
THAT WAS A COMMON LAW?
- MAY I CONTINUE PLEASE?

1629
01:29:28,397 --> 01:29:30,332
ALSO, IT'S A CRIME NOT
TO BELIEVE IN THE BIBLE.

1630
01:29:30,433 --> 01:29:32,768
THAT'S A COMMON LAW.
THIS IS NOT A TRIAL.

1631
01:29:32,868 --> 01:29:34,770
- YOUR HONOR--
- THIS IS NOT A TRIAL.
IT'S A LYNCHING,

1632
01:29:34,870 --> 01:29:36,905
AND I'M NOT
GONNA PARTICIPATE
IN MY OWN LYNCHING.

1633
01:29:37,005 --> 01:29:39,307
CAN WE ALL PRESUME--
JUST FOR THE HELL OF IT--

1634
01:29:39,408 --> 01:29:41,977
- THAT WE ARE REALLY
IN A COURTROOM, OKAY?
- NO, I WILL NOT PRESUME.

1635
01:29:42,077 --> 01:29:44,046
- THAT THERE'S
A JUDGE, A JURY...
- I REFUSE TO PRESUME.

1636
01:29:44,146 --> 01:29:46,415
...AND REAL WITNESSES.
CAN WE PRESUME THAT THIS
IS A REAL TRIAL?

1637
01:29:46,515 --> 01:29:49,552
NO, WE CAN'T,
BECAUSE THERE IS
NO LAW HERE.

1638
01:29:49,652 --> 01:29:51,654
- AM I WRONG?
- YOU'RE WRONG!

1639
01:29:51,754 --> 01:29:54,890
PROVE IT.
CITE TO ME ONE...

1640
01:29:54,990 --> 01:29:57,325
COMMON-LAW CASE
OF ASSISTED SUICIDE.

1641
01:29:57,426 --> 01:30:00,328
- ONE. GO AHEAD.
I'M LISTENING.
- I WILL ASK THE QUESTIONS, SIR.

1642
01:30:00,429 --> 01:30:03,566
- WE'RE ALL WAITING. CITE ONE.
- ARE YOU GONNA ANSWER
MY QUESTION?

1643
01:30:03,666 --> 01:30:05,768
- SMARTASS.
GO AHEAD AND DO IT.
- YOUR HONOR.

1644
01:30:05,868 --> 01:30:07,503
Judge:
DR. KEVORKIAN,
I'M WARNING YOU.

1645
01:30:07,603 --> 01:30:10,205
YOU KNOW, YOUR HONOR,
YOU MAY CITE ME
FOR CONTEMPT,

1646
01:30:10,305 --> 01:30:11,940
BUT I AM FINISHED
WITH THIS FARCE.

1647
01:30:12,040 --> 01:30:14,376
I'M NOT GONNA
BE A PART OF IT.
I JUST CAN'T.

1648
01:30:14,477 --> 01:30:16,111
- I'M SO SICK AND TIRED...
- ( gavel clacking )

1649
01:30:16,211 --> 01:30:18,481
- ...OF THIS FUSION...
- RESUME THE STAND,
DR. KEVORKIAN.

1650
01:30:18,581 --> 01:30:20,749
...OF RELIGIOUS DOGMA
AND MEDICINE!

1651
01:30:20,849 --> 01:30:22,785
CAN I ASK FOR A RECESS,
PLEASE? JUST A COUPLE
OF MINUTES, YOUR HONOR.

1652
01:30:22,885 --> 01:30:24,987
- RECESS.
- THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.
THANK YOU.

1653
01:30:25,087 --> 01:30:27,656
( people chatting )

1654
01:30:29,558 --> 01:30:30,893
( chuckles )

1655
01:30:30,993 --> 01:30:35,531
Can't--
there's nothing
anybody can do

1656
01:30:35,631 --> 01:30:37,566
for me and there's
certainly no step...

1657
01:30:37,666 --> 01:30:39,568
TIME TO GIVE IT UP, DICK.

1658
01:30:39,668 --> 01:30:43,171
...or I would not be here.

1659
01:30:47,175 --> 01:30:50,345
- ( people chatting )
- Woman: GO ON. GO ON.

1660
01:30:50,445 --> 01:30:52,014
JACK.

1661
01:30:52,114 --> 01:30:53,649
JACK.

1662
01:30:53,749 --> 01:30:56,151
I TOLD YOU THOSE
VIDEOTAPES WERE GOING
TO BE OUR GOLDEN TICKET.

1663
01:30:56,251 --> 01:31:00,523
WE HAVE TO TAKE THIS
TO THE SUPREME COURT, GEOFF.

1664
01:31:00,623 --> 01:31:01,857
WE HAVE TO DO IT.

1665
01:31:01,957 --> 01:31:04,059
WE'VE STILL GOT
TO GET A LAW

1666
01:31:04,159 --> 01:31:06,962
- LEGALIZING
ASSISTED SUICIDE, NO?
- CONGRATULATIONS.

1667
01:31:07,062 --> 01:31:10,232
HEY, JACK.
COME ON. YOU WON.
ENJOY YOURSELF.

1668
01:31:10,332 --> 01:31:12,234
MORGANROTH IS RIGHT, JACK.
YOU'LL NEVER SEE ANOTHER
COURTROOM AGAIN.

1669
01:31:12,334 --> 01:31:13,802
THE HOUSE OF CARDS
IS FALLING

1670
01:31:13,902 --> 01:31:16,071
AND ENGLER'S
GOING DOWN WITH IT.

1671
01:31:17,973 --> 01:31:21,143
- LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!
- Man: COME ON.

1672
01:31:21,243 --> 01:31:23,712
Fieger:
PLEASE PLEASE, I HAVE
AN IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT.

1673
01:31:24,813 --> 01:31:26,682
I HAVE DECIDED
TO RUN FOR GOVERNOR.

1674
01:31:26,782 --> 01:31:28,450
- HEAR HEAR!
- ( cheering )

1675
01:31:28,551 --> 01:31:31,720
- Man: WHOO!
- Fieger: FIEGER
FOR GOVERNOR!

1676
01:31:33,522 --> 01:31:35,891
FEIGER'S
YOUR FINEST!

1677
01:31:36,859 --> 01:31:39,562
NEXT STOP--
LANSING!

1678
01:31:51,339 --> 01:31:56,078
Fieger:
DAVID GORCYCA,
OAKLAND COUNTY PROSECUTOR.

1679
01:31:56,178 --> 01:31:57,880
IT HAS
A NICE RING TO IT.

1680
01:31:57,980 --> 01:32:01,416
YOU KNOW, YOU OWE ME
AFTER THE WAY I DEMOLISHED
THOMPSON FOR YOU.

1681
01:32:01,516 --> 01:32:03,652
AND I KNOW YOU'LL STAY
OUT OF JACK'S HAIR.

1682
01:32:03,752 --> 01:32:05,988
THOMSON BLEW AWAY
TOO MANY TAXPAYER DOLLARS

1683
01:32:06,088 --> 01:32:07,522
ON THESE PROSECUTIONS.

1684
01:32:07,623 --> 01:32:09,892
I'VE NO INTENTION
TO WASTE ONE MORE NICKEL.

1685
01:32:09,992 --> 01:32:11,927
AS LONG AS KEVORKIAN
STAYS IN LINE,

1686
01:32:12,027 --> 01:32:14,296
HE CAN ASSIST
AS MANY PATIENTS
AS HE DAMN WELL PLEASES.

1687
01:32:14,396 --> 01:32:18,166
NO WORRIES.
JACK'S LEARNED TO LISTEN
TO EVERYTHING I SAY.

1688
01:32:19,802 --> 01:32:22,370
Jack:
YOU KNOW,
I'M ONLY OPERATING

1689
01:32:22,470 --> 01:32:24,573
BY THE GRACE
OF THIS PROSECUTOR.

1690
01:32:24,673 --> 01:32:27,776
"GO AHEAD.
YOU CAN GO DO YOUR THING

1691
01:32:27,876 --> 01:32:30,212
IN SOME DARK LITTLE CORNER
OF THE UNIVERSE,

1692
01:32:30,312 --> 01:32:32,347
BUT DO IT QUIETLY."
YOU KNOW?

1693
01:32:32,447 --> 01:32:35,150
OH, THE LINGERING
OF DEATH.

1694
01:32:35,250 --> 01:32:36,919
WHAT A BUSINESS.

1695
01:32:37,019 --> 01:32:38,887
KEEP DEATH ALIVE.

1696
01:32:38,987 --> 01:32:41,323
HOSPITALS DON'T MAKE
MONEY OTHERWISE.

1697
01:32:41,423 --> 01:32:43,558
DRUG COMPANIES EITHER.

1698
01:32:43,659 --> 01:32:46,261
IF YOU'RE RICH
AND YOU HAVE THE MONEY,

1699
01:32:46,361 --> 01:32:48,363
YOU CAN PAY TO DIE.

1700
01:32:48,463 --> 01:32:50,899
BUT THE POOR,
THEY CAN ONLY AFFORD

1701
01:32:50,999 --> 01:32:53,501
TO STICK IT OUT
AND SUFFER.

1702
01:32:53,602 --> 01:32:56,939
THEY SAY COMPLACENCY
IS A VIRTUE.

1703
01:32:57,039 --> 01:33:00,508
OH, STOP WHINING.
YOU MAKE ME MORE NAUSEOUS
THAN MY CHEMO.

1704
01:33:00,609 --> 01:33:04,212
YOU HAVE FULL REIGN.
JUST DEAL WITH IT.

1705
01:33:04,312 --> 01:33:07,783
YEAH.

1706
01:33:07,883 --> 01:33:10,619
( sighs )
I THINK THE BIGGEST
MISTAKE OF MY LIFE

1707
01:33:10,719 --> 01:33:12,554
WAS NOT GETTING MARRIED.

1708
01:33:12,655 --> 01:33:15,323
- EXCUSE ME?
- I COULD'VE, YOU KNOW,

1709
01:33:15,423 --> 01:33:17,626
PROCREATED.

1710
01:33:18,894 --> 01:33:20,428
KEPT THE FAMILY NAME ALIVE.

1711
01:33:20,528 --> 01:33:21,997
- WHY NOT?
- PROCREATE?

1712
01:33:22,097 --> 01:33:24,667
YOU WOULD'VE MADE
THAT BIG A SACRIFICE

1713
01:33:24,767 --> 01:33:28,904
TO KEEP THE FAMILY NAME ALIVE?
YOU WOULD'VE DONE THAT?

1714
01:33:29,004 --> 01:33:32,841
WELL, SOMETIMES,
YOU'VE GOT TO GET
YOUR HANDS A LITTLE DIRTY.

1715
01:33:35,177 --> 01:33:38,747
WELL, COULD YOU HAVE
LOVED THOUGH, DOC?

1716
01:33:39,815 --> 01:33:42,150
THAT'S THE BIGGER QUESTION.

1717
01:33:42,250 --> 01:33:44,352
COULD YOU HAVE LOVED?

1718
01:33:48,456 --> 01:33:50,826
YOU DIDN'T PUT SUGAR
IN HERE AGAIN.

1719
01:33:52,194 --> 01:33:55,397
AH. DON'T GET UP.

1720
01:33:55,497 --> 01:33:58,333
WE NEED TO HAVE
A CONVERSATION.

1721
01:34:00,002 --> 01:34:02,470
MMM. YOU KNOW
I'M NOT LUGGING

1722
01:34:02,570 --> 01:34:04,940
THIS THING AROUND
JUST 'CAUSE IT'S SEXY.

1723
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:07,843
AND YOU'RE THE ONLY DOCTOR
IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD

1724
01:34:07,943 --> 01:34:09,912
THAT PRACTICES EUTHANASIA.

1725
01:34:10,012 --> 01:34:12,414
OH, WE'RE NOT THERE YET.

1726
01:34:12,514 --> 01:34:14,016
YOU'VE GOT
PLENTY OF TIME.

1727
01:34:14,116 --> 01:34:17,352
( crowd chanting on TV )
Fieger! Fieger! Fieger!

1728
01:34:17,452 --> 01:34:21,924
Fieger:
Okay okay, let's keep
these signs up.

1729
01:34:22,024 --> 01:34:24,559
Let's keep 'em up there.
Oh, don't drop that.

1730
01:34:24,659 --> 01:34:26,561
( laughs )
Did you get a t-shirt?

1731
01:34:26,661 --> 01:34:29,264
Get those buttons
out there.

1732
01:34:29,364 --> 01:34:30,766
Buttons! Buttons!

1733
01:34:30,866 --> 01:34:32,467
Woman:
What is
your official stance

1734
01:34:32,567 --> 01:34:34,469
on the assisted suicide issue?

1735
01:34:34,569 --> 01:34:36,438
I give my word
to the people of Michigan

1736
01:34:36,538 --> 01:34:39,307
that I will not be supporting
doctor-assisted suicide.

1737
01:34:39,407 --> 01:34:41,977
Woman:
Even with your history
with Dr. Kevorkian?

1738
01:34:42,077 --> 01:34:44,512
What I've always said
is I support

1739
01:34:44,612 --> 01:34:47,249
the individual's right
to choose.

1740
01:34:47,349 --> 01:34:48,884
But I repeat--

1741
01:34:48,984 --> 01:34:51,553
I will not be supporting
doctor-assisted suicide.

1742
01:34:51,653 --> 01:34:53,521
Woman:
There you have it, folks.

1743
01:34:53,621 --> 01:34:55,457
Now back to you, John.

1744
01:34:55,557 --> 01:34:57,059
This is Megan
from Channel 4 News.

1745
01:34:57,159 --> 01:34:59,061
There's something
happening here, people.

1746
01:34:59,161 --> 01:35:02,097
And if you don't
know what it is,
it's Geoffrey Fieger.

1747
01:35:02,197 --> 01:35:05,700
Megan:
The 47-year-old Fieger's
flare for the dramatic

1748
01:35:05,801 --> 01:35:07,970
has enlivened a campaign
that most analysts

1749
01:35:08,070 --> 01:35:10,505
said would be
dishwater dull.

1750
01:35:10,605 --> 01:35:12,741
No longer advocating
for Kevorkian,

1751
01:35:12,841 --> 01:35:14,877
Fieger is now
advocating for himself

1752
01:35:14,977 --> 01:35:17,145
and campaigning
with Michigan voters,

1753
01:35:17,245 --> 01:35:20,482
billing himself
as the anti-politician.

1754
01:35:20,582 --> 01:35:23,786
Fieger:
Governor Engler is
dumber than Dan Quayle

1755
01:35:23,886 --> 01:35:25,687
and twice as ugly.

1756
01:35:25,788 --> 01:35:27,522
He's a racist
and he's a liar.

1757
01:35:27,622 --> 01:35:30,959
Megan:
It's the acerbic tongue
of Geoffrey Fieger's

1758
01:35:31,059 --> 01:35:33,796
that Republicans say
they'll make the major issue

1759
01:35:33,896 --> 01:35:36,031
of this upcoming race.

1760
01:35:45,841 --> 01:35:47,742
( camera clicks )

1761
01:35:49,011 --> 01:35:50,645
GOD HAD HIS CHANCE
TO COME TAKE ME.

1762
01:35:50,745 --> 01:35:53,315
I'LL GO TO HIM INSTEAD.

1763
01:35:56,551 --> 01:35:59,154
( gas hissing )

1764
01:36:44,867 --> 01:36:46,935
ARE YOU GONNA
LOOK AT ME, DOC?

1765
01:36:49,771 --> 01:36:51,339
OR IS IT
AN ARMENIAN THING?

1766
01:36:51,439 --> 01:36:55,243
- IS WHAT?
- YOU KNOW,
KEEPING IT ALL INSIDE,

1767
01:36:55,343 --> 01:37:00,148
JUST KEEP IT GOING.
IS THAT AN ARMENIAN THING?

1768
01:37:00,248 --> 01:37:03,285
- OH, I DON'T KNOW.
- ACTUALLY, HOW COULD
IT BE AN ARMENIAN THING?

1769
01:37:03,385 --> 01:37:06,721
MARGO WAS JUST
AS ARMENIAN AS YOU ARE
AND SHE TALKED MY EAR OFF.

1770
01:37:06,821 --> 01:37:09,157
( chuckles )
SHE TOLD ME EVERYTHING.

1771
01:37:09,257 --> 01:37:12,094
SHE COULD SHARE.
YOU DON'T SHARE.

1772
01:37:12,194 --> 01:37:15,463
WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO SHARE?

1773
01:37:15,563 --> 01:37:19,234
ANYTHING.
EVERYTHING.

1774
01:37:19,334 --> 01:37:21,937
- I'M AFRAID--
- I KNOW. I KNOW.

1775
01:37:22,037 --> 01:37:24,672
- NO, YOU DON'T.
- YES, I DO.

1776
01:37:24,772 --> 01:37:27,509
I'M NOT AFRAID
FOR MYSELF, YOU DOPE.

1777
01:37:27,609 --> 01:37:30,245
I'M AFRAID FOR YOU.

1778
01:37:30,345 --> 01:37:33,916
YOUR LITTLE BAND
OF KEVORKIANS IS
SHRINKING INTO NOTHING.

1779
01:37:35,217 --> 01:37:37,385
WILL YOU COME CLOSER?
I CAN'T SEE YOU RIGHT THERE.

1780
01:37:39,154 --> 01:37:40,788
HERE.

1781
01:37:40,889 --> 01:37:42,290
- RIGHT HERE.
- YES. OKAY.

1782
01:37:42,390 --> 01:37:44,192
SEE, YOU KNOW MARGO
AND I WERE THE ONLY TWO

1783
01:37:44,292 --> 01:37:47,162
THAT COULD TELL YOU
TO SHUT UP.
( chuckles )

1784
01:37:47,262 --> 01:37:51,499
LOOK. YOU NEED
MORE PEOPLE IN YOUR CORNER,

1785
01:37:51,599 --> 01:37:53,501
NOT LESS.

1786
01:37:53,601 --> 01:37:55,537
PEOPLE THAT YOU CAN TRUST.

1787
01:37:57,172 --> 01:37:59,574
AND THE ONLY WAY
PEOPLE TRUST EACH OTHER

1788
01:37:59,674 --> 01:38:01,876
IS IF THEY KNOW EACH OTHER.

1789
01:38:01,977 --> 01:38:03,578
AND NOBODY KNOWS YOU.

1790
01:38:03,678 --> 01:38:05,713
NOBODY.

1791
01:38:05,813 --> 01:38:08,516
HOW DID IT FEEL

1792
01:38:08,616 --> 01:38:11,019
WHEN YOUR MOTHER
WAS DYING?

1793
01:38:11,119 --> 01:38:13,956
YOU WERE A DOCTOR,
A HEALER,

1794
01:38:14,056 --> 01:38:17,559
AND YOU WERE HELPLESS.
HOW DID THAT FEEL?

1795
01:38:19,794 --> 01:38:22,664
( sighs )
YOU KNOW, I FAILED HER.

1796
01:38:22,764 --> 01:38:24,967
I FAILED MY MOTHER.

1797
01:38:27,202 --> 01:38:28,570
AND?

1798
01:38:31,974 --> 01:38:34,142
SHE ONCE SAID TO ME

1799
01:38:34,776 --> 01:38:37,679
"IMAGINE, JACK,

1800
01:38:37,779 --> 01:38:41,916
THE WORST TOOTHACHE
IN THE WORLD.

1801
01:38:43,118 --> 01:38:46,221
NOW IMAGINE
THAT TOOTHACHE

1802
01:38:46,321 --> 01:38:49,157
BEING IN EVERY BONE
IN YOUR BODY."

1803
01:38:49,257 --> 01:38:51,359
THAT'S--

1804
01:38:51,459 --> 01:38:54,696
THAT'S WHAT WAS
HAPPENING TO HER.

1805
01:38:56,498 --> 01:39:01,136
SHE WAS MY MOTHER.
I DEVOTED MY LIFE TO HER.

1806
01:39:01,803 --> 01:39:03,705
SO...

1807
01:39:03,805 --> 01:39:05,740
EH...

1808
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:07,909
( distant train rattling )

1809
01:39:08,010 --> 01:39:11,179
SO HOW DID--
HOW DID YOU FEEL?

1810
01:39:20,588 --> 01:39:23,091
I REMEMBER--

1811
01:39:23,191 --> 01:39:25,227
I REMEMBER BEING IN
THIS LITTLE HOSPITAL ROOM--

1812
01:39:25,327 --> 01:39:27,262
THIS CHILLY LITTLE ROOM,

1813
01:39:27,362 --> 01:39:31,199
A LONE WINDOW
IN THE RED BRICK WALL--

1814
01:39:31,299 --> 01:39:34,136
THAT'S WHAT IT FACED--

1815
01:39:34,236 --> 01:39:38,006
AND ALL THESE DOCTORS
CIRCLING AROUND MY MOTHER

1816
01:39:38,106 --> 01:39:41,343
TRYING TO KEEP HER ALIVE.

1817
01:39:45,547 --> 01:39:47,782
AND I WAS HELPLESS.

1818
01:39:47,882 --> 01:39:50,152
I WAS POWERLESS,

1819
01:39:50,252 --> 01:39:52,720
HELPLESS
AND INEFFECTUAL.

1820
01:39:59,427 --> 01:40:01,229
AND I FELT

1821
01:40:01,996 --> 01:40:04,332
LOST.

1822
01:40:07,702 --> 01:40:10,038
I WAS LOST.

1823
01:40:12,640 --> 01:40:14,609
THAT'S HOW I FELT.

1824
01:40:17,912 --> 01:40:19,714
THANKS, DOC.

1825
01:40:24,052 --> 01:40:26,020
THANKS.

1826
01:40:32,227 --> 01:40:35,497
- RAY AND THE KIDS--
- Jack: YEAH.

1827
01:40:44,172 --> 01:40:47,142
( whispers )
GIVE MY LOVE TO MARGO.

1828
01:40:51,079 --> 01:40:52,814
YES.

1829
01:40:54,082 --> 01:40:55,817
Janet:
HEY, GUYS.

1830
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:07,695
OKAY.

1831
01:41:28,150 --> 01:41:29,784
( train tooting )

1832
01:41:44,766 --> 01:41:46,734
( geese honking )

1833
01:41:55,042 --> 01:41:57,679
( chattering )

1834
01:41:57,779 --> 01:41:59,747
Janet:
YOUR LITTLE BAND
OF KEVORKIANS

1835
01:41:59,847 --> 01:42:02,217
IS SHRINKING
INTO NOTHING.

1836
01:42:02,317 --> 01:42:05,720
- ( cameras clicking )
- ( chattering continues )

1837
01:42:07,855 --> 01:42:11,092
( reporters shouting )
JACK! JACK! DR. KEVORKIAN!

1838
01:42:11,193 --> 01:42:13,495
DR. KEVORKIAN!
JACK, OVER HERE!

1839
01:42:15,430 --> 01:42:17,031
Janet:
I'M AFRAID FOR YOU.

1840
01:42:17,131 --> 01:42:22,370
YOU'RE NOT
THE BEST SPOKESPERSON
FOR THE CAUSE, REALLY.

1841
01:42:22,470 --> 01:42:25,373
WE HAVE TO TAKE THIS
TO THE SUPREME COURT, GEOFF,

1842
01:42:25,473 --> 01:42:27,475
'CAUSE I DON'T
HAVE FOREVER.

1843
01:42:27,575 --> 01:42:30,044
YOUR LITTLE BAND
OF KEVORKIANS IS SHRINKING

1844
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:31,779
INTO NOTHING,
DISAPPEARING.

1845
01:42:31,879 --> 01:42:34,416
DR. KEVORKIAN,
A QUESTION!

1846
01:42:34,516 --> 01:42:37,619
Man:
Dr. Jack Kevorkian was
among the who's who on hand

1847
01:42:37,719 --> 01:42:40,922
to celebrate
"Time" magazine's
75th anniversary gala

1848
01:42:41,022 --> 01:42:42,490
at Radio City Music Hall.

1849
01:42:42,590 --> 01:42:44,726
The big night was attended
by many of the faces

1850
01:42:44,826 --> 01:42:47,362
who have appeared
on "Time"'s covers
over the decades.

1851
01:42:47,462 --> 01:42:49,997
Janet:
YOU NEED MORE PEOPLE
IN YOUR CORNER.

1852
01:42:50,097 --> 01:42:51,399
I'M AFRAID FOR YOU.

1853
01:42:51,499 --> 01:42:53,235
Man:
...Joe DiMaggio
to Jerry Falwell

1854
01:42:53,335 --> 01:42:54,969
to Raquel Welch
to Henry Kissinger.

1855
01:42:55,069 --> 01:42:58,506
Janet:
I'M AFRAID FOR YOU.

1856
01:42:58,606 --> 01:43:01,108
YOUR LITTLE BAND
OF KEVORKIANS IS
SHRINKING INTO NOTHING.

1857
01:43:01,209 --> 01:43:03,778
Jack's voice:
I DON'T HAVE FOREVER.
WE HAVE TO TAKE THIS

1858
01:43:03,878 --> 01:43:06,681
TO THE SUPREME COURT, GEOFF.

1859
01:43:11,753 --> 01:43:14,756
Fieger:
JACK, I'M DEALING
WITH THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT.

1860
01:43:14,856 --> 01:43:17,725
- Jack: MY CONDOLENCES.
- Fieger: AND THE DISABILITY
GROUP-- I MEAN,

1861
01:43:17,825 --> 01:43:19,527
THEY THINK YOU WANT TO KILL
THE WHOLE LOT OF THEM.

1862
01:43:19,627 --> 01:43:22,864
SO? WHAT HAVE
WE ACCOMPLISHED?

1863
01:43:22,964 --> 01:43:27,369
NO LAW HAS BEEN PASSED.
I MEAN, THIS IS THE PRELUD.

1864
01:43:27,469 --> 01:43:30,905
THIS IS THE BEGINNING.
THE BATTLE OF CONCORD,

1865
01:43:31,005 --> 01:43:33,475
- THE BATTLE OF LEXINGTON--
- WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

1866
01:43:33,575 --> 01:43:35,543
I'M THINKING
OF THE SUPREME COURT!

1867
01:43:35,643 --> 01:43:37,512
I'M THINKING
OF GOING ALL THE WAY.

1868
01:43:37,612 --> 01:43:40,181
IF THEY WANT TO SILENCE ME,
LET THEM PROSECUTE ME,

1869
01:43:40,282 --> 01:43:42,216
CONVICT ME,
SEND ME TO JAIL

1870
01:43:42,317 --> 01:43:43,851
LIKE MARTIN LUTHER KING,

1871
01:43:43,951 --> 01:43:47,121
- GALILEO OR--
- THE SUPREME COURT
HAS ALREADY SAID

1872
01:43:47,221 --> 01:43:50,925
THAT THE STATES DO
HAVE THE RIGHT TO OUTLAW
DOCTOR-ASSISTED SUICIDE!

1873
01:43:51,025 --> 01:43:52,827
SEE? YOU DON'T LISTEN.
YOU DON'T LISTEN!
THEY ALSO SAID

1874
01:43:52,927 --> 01:43:55,763
THAT THEY WOULD HEAR A CASE
IF THE RIGHT ONE CAME ALONG.

1875
01:43:55,863 --> 01:43:58,700
IF IT WAS
FOR A PARTICULARLY
SUFFERING INDIVIDUAL,

1876
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:02,270
THEY WOULD HEAR IT.
YOU DON'T LISTEN.

1877
01:44:03,771 --> 01:44:05,072
( door closes )

1878
01:44:05,172 --> 01:44:07,409
( geese honking )

1879
01:44:19,654 --> 01:44:23,458
Jack:
OKAY, TOM, SO HAVE
YOU DISCUSSED

1880
01:44:23,558 --> 01:44:26,260
YOUR WISHES
WITH YOUR WIFE
AND FAMILY?

1881
01:44:26,361 --> 01:44:29,597
DO THEY WANT YOU
TO GO ON?

1882
01:44:30,798 --> 01:44:32,233
( slurring ) YES,

1883
01:44:32,334 --> 01:44:34,936
THEY UNDERSTAND

1884
01:44:35,036 --> 01:44:37,739
WHY.

1885
01:44:39,073 --> 01:44:43,545
IT'S MY DECISION.

1886
01:44:43,645 --> 01:44:45,480
HE'S SAYING,
"IT'S MY DECISION."

1887
01:44:48,816 --> 01:44:50,652
OKAY.

1888
01:44:50,752 --> 01:44:52,687
NOW, TOM,

1889
01:44:52,787 --> 01:44:56,791
I WILL BE ADMINISTERING
DIRECT LETHAL INJECTION,

1890
01:44:56,891 --> 01:44:59,361
WHAT'S CALLED
"ACTIVE EUTHANASIA."

1891
01:44:59,461 --> 01:45:02,897
You don't want to wait
a month or so?

1892
01:45:02,997 --> 01:45:04,399
No, I do not.

1893
01:45:04,499 --> 01:45:08,069
Jack:
How about two weeks?
Two weeks?

1894
01:45:08,169 --> 01:45:10,271
No.

1895
01:45:10,372 --> 01:45:13,641
A week?
Can you wait a week?

1896
01:45:15,610 --> 01:45:17,011
Yeah.

1897
01:45:17,111 --> 01:45:21,315
Okay. Okay,
we'll stretch it out
another week.

1898
01:45:21,416 --> 01:45:23,951
YOU'RE DOING
THE DEED YOURSELF?

1899
01:45:24,051 --> 01:45:27,822
THIS IS REALLY CROSSING
INTO UNCHARTED TERRITORY.

1900
01:45:27,922 --> 01:45:31,759
WELL, SO I SET SAIL.

1901
01:45:31,859 --> 01:45:35,863
RUDDERLESS, I ADMIT,

1902
01:45:35,963 --> 01:45:38,700
BUT THAT'S THE WAY IT GOES.

1903
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:42,303
Jack on TV: This is
gonna allow me to do
direct lethal injection.

1904
01:45:42,404 --> 01:45:44,606
Jack:
I'M ALL ALONE, NEAL,

1905
01:45:44,706 --> 01:45:47,442
AND I'M RUNNING
OUT OF TIME.

1906
01:45:52,213 --> 01:45:55,116
THAT FIRST DAY
35 YEARS AGO

1907
01:45:55,216 --> 01:45:58,085
YOU CAME DOWN
TO THE BASEMENT LAB

1908
01:45:58,185 --> 01:46:00,588
AND TALKED
TO ALL US MED TECHS.

1909
01:46:00,688 --> 01:46:03,057
YOU WERE THE ONLY DOCTOR
IN OUR WHOLE HOSPITAL

1910
01:46:03,157 --> 01:46:06,494
WE DIDN'T THINK WAS
A POMPOUS SON OF A BITCH.

1911
01:46:06,594 --> 01:46:08,663
WELL, THAT WAS
YOUR FIRST MISTAKE.

1912
01:46:08,763 --> 01:46:10,665
( chuckles )

1913
01:46:10,765 --> 01:46:13,267
I LET YOU STICK
NEEDLES IN ME,

1914
01:46:13,367 --> 01:46:17,071
TRANSFUSE CADAVER BLOOD.

1915
01:46:17,171 --> 01:46:19,941
SHIT, YOU WEREN'T
THE ONLY ONE THAT
GOT HEPATITIS, JACK.

1916
01:46:21,476 --> 01:46:23,911
HELL, WE HAD
SOME GOOD TIMES.

1917
01:46:24,011 --> 01:46:26,581
( chuckles )
YOU HAD PURPOSE, JACK.

1918
01:46:27,949 --> 01:46:30,852
YOU HAD PURPOSE AND I GUESS
I NEEDED SOME TOO.

1919
01:46:32,787 --> 01:46:35,990
AND I KNOW THAT
THIS IS YOUR DECISION,

1920
01:46:37,792 --> 01:46:41,295
BUT IF YOU DECIDE
TO PULL THE PLUG
ON SOMEBODY YOURSELF,

1921
01:46:41,395 --> 01:46:42,830
YOU'RE GONNA
BE FLYING SOLO.

1922
01:46:49,571 --> 01:46:51,939
( phone ringing )

1923
01:46:56,911 --> 01:47:00,314
- YES.
- THIS IS MELODY YOUK.

1924
01:47:00,414 --> 01:47:02,817
I'M-- I'M SORRY
TO CALL SO LATE,

1925
01:47:02,917 --> 01:47:04,251
BUT IT'S TOM.

1926
01:47:04,351 --> 01:47:06,287
He can't wait
any longer.

1927
01:47:06,387 --> 01:47:08,556
He's terrified.

1928
01:47:10,024 --> 01:47:11,759
OH, OKAY. OKAY.

1929
01:47:11,859 --> 01:47:13,928
I'M ON MY WAY.

1930
01:47:14,028 --> 01:47:16,330
JUST SAY YOUR
GOODBYES THEN, MELODY,

1931
01:47:16,430 --> 01:47:19,100
BECAUSE I DON'T
WANT ANYONE TO BE THERE
WHEN I DO THIS THING.

1932
01:47:19,200 --> 01:47:21,636
I'm on my way.

1933
01:47:35,049 --> 01:47:37,218
( car honks )

1934
01:47:41,122 --> 01:47:43,090
( people chattering )

1935
01:47:51,265 --> 01:47:54,268
- JACK.
- Lessenberry: HEY, JACK.

1936
01:47:54,368 --> 01:47:55,937
LOOK WHAT I GOT.

1937
01:48:00,041 --> 01:48:02,744
I WANT
A NATIONAL DEBATE ON THIS,

1938
01:48:02,844 --> 01:48:05,179
BECAUSE ONCE THAT HAPPENS,
THEY HAVE TO CHARGE ME.

1939
01:48:05,279 --> 01:48:08,249
- THEY HAVE
NO CHOICE, RIGHT?
- WITH MURDER, MAYBE.

1940
01:48:08,349 --> 01:48:10,552
I WANT TO PUT
EUTHANASIA ON TRIAL.

1941
01:48:10,652 --> 01:48:12,587
LET THE PEOPLE DECIDE
IF IT'S MURDER OR NOT.

1942
01:48:12,687 --> 01:48:14,121
YOU WANT
TO SACRIFICE YOURSELF?

1943
01:48:14,221 --> 01:48:16,457
BECAUSE YOU'D GO TO PRISON
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

1944
01:48:16,558 --> 01:48:18,359
YOU KNOW I KNOW
BARBARA WALTERS.

1945
01:48:18,459 --> 01:48:20,595
SHE LIKES ME,

1946
01:48:20,695 --> 01:48:22,597
BUT I WANT
A BIGGER AUDIENCE.

1947
01:48:22,697 --> 01:48:25,900
YOU KNOW MIKE WALLACE,
DON'T YOU?

1948
01:48:27,635 --> 01:48:29,837
NO, I UNDER-- YEAH.

1949
01:48:30,504 --> 01:48:31,739
I MEAN IF--

1950
01:48:31,839 --> 01:48:33,675
IF YOU PUT HIM
ON THE AIR,

1951
01:48:33,775 --> 01:48:36,177
WILL YOU BE DEALING WITH
A RATIONAL HUMAN BEING?

1952
01:48:36,277 --> 01:48:39,847
WELL, I CAN'T PROMISE RATIONAL
WITH KEVORKIAN, MIKE.

1953
01:48:39,947 --> 01:48:42,817
BUT IF YOU'RE ASKING
IF HE'S SANE,

1954
01:48:42,917 --> 01:48:45,252
I'D SAY YES.

1955
01:48:45,352 --> 01:48:48,189
HE KNOWS EXACTLY
WHAT HE'S DOING.

1956
01:48:48,289 --> 01:48:50,124
( stopwatch ticking )

1957
01:48:50,224 --> 01:48:52,860
Mike Wallace on TV:
Dr. Jack Kevorkian,
who has acknowledged

1958
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:55,797
helping more
than 130 patients
kill themselves,

1959
01:48:55,897 --> 01:48:57,632
tonight reveals
that two months ago

1960
01:48:57,732 --> 01:49:00,267
he killed one
of his patients himself

1961
01:49:00,367 --> 01:49:02,604
and recorded it
on video tape.

1962
01:49:02,704 --> 01:49:04,972
Tom Youk led
an active life.

1963
01:49:05,072 --> 01:49:07,341
He restored and raced
vintage cars.

1964
01:49:07,441 --> 01:49:09,644
But two years ago
at age 50,

1965
01:49:09,744 --> 01:49:12,013
He was diagnosed
with Lou Gehrig's disease,

1966
01:49:12,113 --> 01:49:14,548
a devastating
incurable illness

1967
01:49:14,649 --> 01:49:16,117
that destroyed
his muscles.

1968
01:49:16,217 --> 01:49:19,086
He lost the use of his legs
and then his arms.

1969
01:49:19,186 --> 01:49:21,689
His family says he was
in terrible pain,

1970
01:49:21,789 --> 01:49:23,858
had trouble breathing
and swallowing,

1971
01:49:23,958 --> 01:49:26,027
and was choking
on his own saliva.

1972
01:49:26,127 --> 01:49:27,929
Jack on TV:
And we're ready to inject.

1973
01:49:28,029 --> 01:49:30,632
We're going to inject
your right arm. Okay?

1974
01:49:30,732 --> 01:49:33,334
Mike:
First the doctor gave
him Seconal

1975
01:49:33,434 --> 01:49:35,737
to put him
to sleep quickly.

1976
01:49:35,837 --> 01:49:39,907
Sleepy, Tom?
Tom, are you asleep?

1977
01:49:42,009 --> 01:49:44,879
Are you asleep?
He's asleep.

1978
01:49:44,979 --> 01:49:48,249
Mike:
Then he injected
a muscle relaxant

1979
01:49:48,349 --> 01:49:49,917
to stop his breathing.

1980
01:49:50,017 --> 01:49:53,755
- And this?
- Paralyzes the muscles.

1981
01:49:53,855 --> 01:49:55,690
Mike:
But he's still alive at--

1982
01:49:55,790 --> 01:49:58,192
Jack:
He's still alive,
but that's why--

1983
01:49:58,292 --> 01:50:01,963
now you see--
now this lack of oxygen
is getting to him now.

1984
01:50:02,063 --> 01:50:04,832
But he's unconscious, deeply,
so it doesn't matter.

1985
01:50:04,932 --> 01:50:07,234
- Mike: Is he dead now?
- Jack: He's dying now,

1986
01:50:07,334 --> 01:50:09,971
Because his oxygen's cut off,
he can't breath.

1987
01:50:10,071 --> 01:50:12,774
So I'll now
quickly inject

1988
01:50:12,874 --> 01:50:15,710
the potassium chloride
to stop the heart.

1989
01:50:17,344 --> 01:50:19,947
Now there's
a straight line.

1990
01:50:20,047 --> 01:50:22,349
- Mike: He's dead.
- Jack: Yeah.

1991
01:50:22,449 --> 01:50:25,152
- The heart has stopped.
- Melody: I'm shocked that
it's come to this,

1992
01:50:25,252 --> 01:50:27,188
that in the '90s

1993
01:50:27,288 --> 01:50:30,191
we have to make
such an issue out
of something

1994
01:50:30,291 --> 01:50:33,360
a person should be
in control of--

1995
01:50:33,460 --> 01:50:35,462
their own life
and death.

1996
01:50:35,562 --> 01:50:39,500
And those who say
that Jack Kevorkian,

1997
01:50:39,600 --> 01:50:41,869
Dr. Death,
is a fanatic?

1998
01:50:41,969 --> 01:50:45,940
Zealot.
I'm fighting
for me, mike,

1999
01:50:46,040 --> 01:50:48,810
For me.
Because this is
a right I want.

2000
01:50:48,910 --> 01:50:51,979
I might wind up
being terribly suffering.

2001
01:50:52,079 --> 01:50:53,948
I'd like to know there's
a colleague out there

2002
01:50:54,048 --> 01:50:56,383
who will come to me
in my time of need.

2003
01:50:56,483 --> 01:50:59,420
Now that might
sound selfish,
and maybe it is,

2004
01:50:59,520 --> 01:51:01,522
but if it helps
everybody else,

2005
01:51:01,622 --> 01:51:03,457
then so be it.

2006
01:51:03,557 --> 01:51:05,693
( stopwatch ticking )

2007
01:51:09,230 --> 01:51:11,733
THIS WHOLE THING'S
MAKING ME SICK
TO MY STOMACH.

2008
01:51:11,833 --> 01:51:15,937
WELL, HE ADMITS
ON NATIONAL TV
THAT HE'S A KILLER.

2009
01:51:16,037 --> 01:51:17,872
50 MILLION HOMES HEARD
HIM SAY "FUCK YOU" TO US.

2010
01:51:17,972 --> 01:51:19,907
I WANT THAT
WHOLE INTERVIEW

2011
01:51:20,007 --> 01:51:22,309
AND I WANT HIM CONVICTED.

2012
01:51:23,310 --> 01:51:24,779
LET'S MAKE
IT HAPPEN, JOHN.

2013
01:51:24,879 --> 01:51:26,247
HE'S GONE TOO FAR.

2014
01:51:26,347 --> 01:51:28,582
- ( gunshot )
- ( geese honking )

2015
01:51:28,682 --> 01:51:31,285
I'M GONNA
REPRESENT MYSELF.

2016
01:51:31,385 --> 01:51:34,121
WHAT? WHAT,
YOU'RE FIRING ME?

2017
01:51:34,221 --> 01:51:37,725
FINALLY I GET TO SAY
WHAT I WANT TO SAY.

2018
01:51:38,893 --> 01:51:40,962
NO LAWYER,
NOT EVEN YOU,

2019
01:51:41,062 --> 01:51:43,697
CAN ADDRESS
A JURY THE WAY I CAN.

2020
01:51:43,798 --> 01:51:46,433
HO! SKEDADDLE!

2021
01:51:46,533 --> 01:51:48,202
( gunshot )

2022
01:51:48,302 --> 01:51:50,137
- MIGRATE, WILL YOU?!
- ( gun cocks )

2023
01:51:50,237 --> 01:51:52,206
- JACK, YOU DON'T KNOW
SHIT ABOUT LAW.
- ( gunshot )

2024
01:51:52,306 --> 01:51:54,241
OKAY? THEY'LL HURT YOU.

2025
01:51:54,341 --> 01:51:56,010
NO, I'M GONNA HURT THEM,

2026
01:51:56,110 --> 01:51:59,814
BECAUSE IF
I LOSE, I HURT THEM;
IF I WIN, I HURT THEM.

2027
01:51:59,914 --> 01:52:01,382
WELL, YOU'RE LUCKY
YOU'RE IN MICHIGAN,

2028
01:52:01,482 --> 01:52:03,450
'CAUSE IF YOU WERE
IN SOME OTHER STATE,
THEY'D FRY YOUR ASS.

2029
01:52:03,550 --> 01:52:06,287
HERE THEY'LL JUST TOSS YOU
IN A CELL AND THROW AWAY
THE KEY FOREVER.

2030
01:52:06,387 --> 01:52:08,823
- THIS IS NOT A GAME.
- NO, IT'S A GAME.

2031
01:52:08,923 --> 01:52:11,826
IT'S A GAME THAT
IF I LOSE, I WIN,

2032
01:52:11,926 --> 01:52:14,028
BECAUSE I GO
TO THE SUPREME COURT.

2033
01:52:14,128 --> 01:52:17,664
I GET THIS DEBATE
IN FRONT OF THE PEOPLE
WHERE IT BELONGS.

2034
01:52:17,765 --> 01:52:20,134
THAT'S AN ASSUMPTION.
WHAT IF YOU'RE WRONG?

2035
01:52:20,234 --> 01:52:22,369
- NEVER BEEN WRONG.
- ARE YOU WILLING TO SET BACK
THE LEGALIZATION

2036
01:52:22,469 --> 01:52:25,172
- OF ASSISTED SUICIDE
FOR GOD KNOWS HOW LONG?!
- I'M NOT GONNA START NOW.

2037
01:52:25,272 --> 01:52:28,742
- MIGRATE, WILL YOU?!
- JACK, JACK, WOULD YOU
FORGET THE GEESE?

2038
01:52:28,843 --> 01:52:30,845
MIGRATE! LOOK AT YOU,
HIDING BEHIND THE BOAT.

2039
01:52:30,945 --> 01:52:32,679
- ( gunshot )
- ( geese honking )

2040
01:52:32,780 --> 01:52:35,082
YOU KNOW,
I NEVER MINDED
FEEDING THEM,

2041
01:52:35,182 --> 01:52:38,352
BUT LOOK AT THIS.
ALL OVER THERE'S POOP!

2042
01:52:38,452 --> 01:52:40,454
WATCH WHERE
YOU'RE STEPPING.
LOOK AT THIS.

2043
01:52:44,491 --> 01:52:45,626
- GEOFF.
- ( gun cocks )

2044
01:52:45,726 --> 01:52:49,196
- YEAH?
- YOUR PROBLEM--

2045
01:52:50,697 --> 01:52:52,199
YOU DON'T SEE
THE BIG PICTURE.

2046
01:52:52,299 --> 01:52:54,836
MY PROBLEM IS THAT
YOU'RE A STUBBORN FOOL.

2047
01:52:54,936 --> 01:52:57,104
FOR A BRILLIANT MAN,
YOU SHOW AN ALARMING
LACK OF JUDGMENT

2048
01:52:57,204 --> 01:53:01,809
- WHEN IT COUNTS THE MOST.
- I DON'T CARE WHAT
HAPPENS TO ME,

2049
01:53:01,909 --> 01:53:05,012
AND I'M NOT AFRAID
BECAUSE I'M RIGHT.

2050
01:53:09,350 --> 01:53:13,320
- ( crowd cheering )
- Engler on TV: thank you
very much!

2051
01:53:13,420 --> 01:53:16,157
MAN
A grateful John Engler enjoys
the thrill of his victory

2052
01:53:16,257 --> 01:53:18,125
for a third term
as Michigan's governor.

2053
01:53:18,225 --> 01:53:20,661
He trounced
his democratic opponent.

2054
01:53:20,761 --> 01:53:23,030
Man Â£2:
Geoffrey Fieger has to feel
somewhat humiliated today.

2055
01:53:23,130 --> 01:53:25,466
- This is a man who is
not used to losing...
- ( typewriter clicking )

2056
01:53:25,566 --> 01:53:28,302
...not used to losing
the big ones, certainly,

2057
01:53:28,402 --> 01:53:31,538
the voters of Michigan have
pretty resoundingly said,

2058
01:53:31,638 --> 01:53:34,876
"Geoffrey,
we might hire you
if we had a legal case,

2059
01:53:34,976 --> 01:53:38,479
but we don't want you
to be our governor.

2060
01:53:38,579 --> 01:53:40,247
( chanting )
DEATH IS NOT WELCOME HERE!
DEATH IS NOT--

2061
01:53:40,347 --> 01:53:43,550
Woman:
PRETRIAL HEARINGS GET
UNDERWAY TODAY

2062
01:53:43,650 --> 01:53:46,587
on the people
of the State of Michigan
Versus Jack Kevorkian.

2063
01:53:46,687 --> 01:53:49,056
Now this is following that
controversial broadcast

2064
01:53:49,156 --> 01:53:51,959
of the videotape
showing Dr. Jack Kevorkian

2065
01:53:52,059 --> 01:53:54,795
giving a fatal dose
of chemicals to Thomas Youk

2066
01:53:54,896 --> 01:53:57,064
on the news program
"60 Minutes."

2067
01:53:57,164 --> 01:53:59,901
A wide array
of protest groups
have amassed

2068
01:54:00,001 --> 01:54:01,568
here outside
the Oakland County
Court House,

2069
01:54:01,668 --> 01:54:04,838
contentiously voicing both
their opposition and support.

2070
01:54:04,939 --> 01:54:08,275
One way or another,
this is Dr. Jack Kevorkian's
fifth trial

2071
01:54:08,375 --> 01:54:10,577
and it very well
may be his last.

2072
01:54:13,380 --> 01:54:15,616
Woman Â£2:
I'VE LOOKED AT ALL
THE MOTIONS, GENTLEMEN.

2073
01:54:15,716 --> 01:54:17,919
MR. GOROSH,
I'M DENYING YOUR MOTIONS

2074
01:54:18,019 --> 01:54:20,654
TO QUASH ALL THE CHARGES
AGAINST DR. KEVORKIAN.

2075
01:54:20,754 --> 01:54:22,957
THERE IS
NO BASIS TO DISMISS.

2076
01:54:23,057 --> 01:54:25,692
BUT I DO THINK THERE
IS AN ARGUMENT HERE

2077
01:54:25,792 --> 01:54:27,828
THAT MURDER
AND ASSISTED SUICIDE ARE

2078
01:54:27,929 --> 01:54:29,796
INCOMPATIBLE CHARGES
BY DEFINITION.

2079
01:54:29,897 --> 01:54:34,368
WELL, THAT MAY BE
SOMETHING TO BE DEBATED
IN A LAW SCHOOL CLASS,

2080
01:54:34,468 --> 01:54:35,970
BUT NOT IN MY COURTROOM.

2081
01:54:36,070 --> 01:54:38,940
AND, MR. SKRZYNSKI,
I'M GRANTING YOUR MOTION

2082
01:54:39,040 --> 01:54:40,774
TO LIMIT TESTIMONY
ON THE MURDER CHARGE

2083
01:54:40,874 --> 01:54:42,944
BUT NOT
ON ASSISTED SUICIDE.

2084
01:54:43,044 --> 01:54:45,412
A PERSON'S PAIN
AND SUFFERING IS
VERY RELEVANT

2085
01:54:45,512 --> 01:54:48,815
WHEN DEFENDING
AN ASSISTED SUICIDE CHARGE.

2086
01:54:48,916 --> 01:54:50,784
THE TRIAL STARTS
IN FIVE DAYS.

2087
01:54:50,884 --> 01:54:52,619
Jack:
OKAY, THANK YOU.

2088
01:54:56,557 --> 01:54:59,426
IT JUST OCCURRED TO ME--

2089
01:54:59,526 --> 01:55:02,629
WHY DON'T WE DROP
THE ASSISTED SUICIDE
CHARGE ALTOGETHER?

2090
01:55:05,466 --> 01:55:07,901
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

2091
01:55:08,002 --> 01:55:10,837
I'M SAYING THAT
WHAT PROVED LETHAL

2092
01:55:10,938 --> 01:55:13,007
IN ALL OUR OTHER CASES WAS

2093
01:55:13,107 --> 01:55:15,076
THE FAMILY MEMBERS
TESTIFYING,

2094
01:55:15,176 --> 01:55:18,712
JURIES HEARING
ABOUT THE CONDITIONS
OF THE VICTIMS,

2095
01:55:18,812 --> 01:55:20,614
HOW MUCH PAIN
THEY WERE IN

2096
01:55:20,714 --> 01:55:22,583
AND ALL THAT BULLSHIT.

2097
01:55:22,683 --> 01:55:24,785
SO IF WE DROP
THE CHARGE,

2098
01:55:24,885 --> 01:55:26,420
MAKE IT ALL
OR NOTHING ON MURDER,

2099
01:55:26,520 --> 01:55:28,789
THE WIDOW,
THE BROTHER--

2100
01:55:28,889 --> 01:55:31,258
THEY WON'T GET
TO TESTIFY.

2101
01:55:31,358 --> 01:55:33,294
PRECISELY.

2102
01:55:33,394 --> 01:55:36,330
JUST TAKE ALL THAT SYMPATHY
OUT OF THE COURTROOM.

2103
01:55:40,534 --> 01:55:41,568
HMM.

2104
01:55:45,739 --> 01:55:47,441
Judge:
DO YOU UNDERSTAND,
DR. KEVORKIAN,

2105
01:55:47,541 --> 01:55:50,311
THAT YOU ARE CHARGED
WITH FIRST-DEGREE MURDER

2106
01:55:50,411 --> 01:55:52,446
AND DELIVERY
OF A CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE

2107
01:55:52,546 --> 01:55:54,982
AND THAT THE ASSISTED
SUICIDE CHARGE

2108
01:55:55,082 --> 01:55:58,085
- HAS BEEN DROPPED?
- I DO. YES.

2109
01:55:58,185 --> 01:56:00,121
Judge:
YOU UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU COULD SPEND

2110
01:56:00,221 --> 01:56:02,990
THE REST
OF YOUR LIFE
IN PRISON?

2111
01:56:04,858 --> 01:56:08,895
WHATEVER IS
LEFT OF IT, SURE.

2112
01:56:08,996 --> 01:56:10,364
YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT PRISON IS?

2113
01:56:10,464 --> 01:56:13,534
DID YOU SEE
"THE SHAWSHANK
REDEMPTION," SIR?

2114
01:56:13,634 --> 01:56:15,936
NO.

2115
01:56:16,037 --> 01:56:19,840
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
YOU MAY NOT DISRUPT
OR INCONVENIENCE THE COURT

2116
01:56:19,940 --> 01:56:22,209
IN ANY WAY,
SHAPE OR FORM?

2117
01:56:22,309 --> 01:56:27,914
I WILL ACT LIKE
THE GUEST THAT I AM.

2118
01:56:28,015 --> 01:56:30,117
YOU'RE NO GUEST.
YOU'RE THE DEFENDANT.

2119
01:56:30,217 --> 01:56:31,952
Man:
What do you think
of Dr. Jack Kevorkian

2120
01:56:32,053 --> 01:56:34,321
actually helping people
kill themselves?

2121
01:56:34,421 --> 01:56:36,690
Well, my grandma's
very sick

2122
01:56:36,790 --> 01:56:38,192
and everyday
she asks me

2123
01:56:38,292 --> 01:56:39,860
"Bring me
Jack Kevorkian."

2124
01:56:39,960 --> 01:56:41,328
Doctors are
supposed to uphold

2125
01:56:41,428 --> 01:56:43,664
the Hippocratic Oath,
though, save lives.

2126
01:56:43,764 --> 01:56:45,466
Some people are dying

2127
01:56:45,566 --> 01:56:48,435
and they should
be dying gracefully
with dignity and honor.

2128
01:56:48,535 --> 01:56:50,237
But I don't think
we ought to put them
out to pasture this way.

2129
01:56:50,337 --> 01:56:52,406
I think he rocks.
He gives people a choice

2130
01:56:52,506 --> 01:56:54,441
of whether or not
they want to suffer

2131
01:56:54,541 --> 01:56:56,443
throughout
terminal illnesses or not.

2132
01:56:56,543 --> 01:56:58,445
Dr. Jack Kevorkian is
one of the most audacious

2133
01:56:58,545 --> 01:57:00,914
serial killers
this country has ever known.

2134
01:57:01,014 --> 01:57:03,117
Let's say your mother
wanted his help,

2135
01:57:03,217 --> 01:57:04,385
wanted to kill herself.

2136
01:57:04,485 --> 01:57:06,053
What would
you think of that?

2137
01:57:06,153 --> 01:57:07,888
Well, if she was
mentally competent,

2138
01:57:07,988 --> 01:57:09,823
I would ask her
what she wanted

2139
01:57:09,923 --> 01:57:11,392
And support her.

2140
01:57:11,492 --> 01:57:13,460
Woman:
The names of dozens
of other people

2141
01:57:13,560 --> 01:57:15,462
who have died with the help
of Jack Kevorkian

2142
01:57:15,562 --> 01:57:18,099
laid out
on the Courthouse Lawn
to make a point.

2143
01:57:18,199 --> 01:57:21,068
conviction is important,
because Jack Kevorkian is

2144
01:57:21,168 --> 01:57:24,105
the most public symbol
of the euthanasia movement
and we need to stop him.

2145
01:57:24,205 --> 01:57:26,240
Skrzynski:
PLEASE TELL US,
DR. DRAGOVIC,

2146
01:57:26,340 --> 01:57:29,210
DID MR. YOUK'S
A.L.S. CONTRIBUTE
TO HIS DEATH AT ALL?

2147
01:57:29,310 --> 01:57:30,911
- NO.
- Skrzynski:
THEN HOW DID HE DIE?

2148
01:57:31,011 --> 01:57:35,216
HE WAS POISONED
BY INTRAVENOUSLY-
INJECTED SUBSTANCES.

2149
01:57:35,316 --> 01:57:37,851
Jack on TV:
Is homicide
always murder, Doctor?

2150
01:57:37,951 --> 01:57:41,122
- No, sir.
- When is it not murder?

2151
01:57:41,222 --> 01:57:42,956
Skrzynski:
Objection.
That's a legal question.

2152
01:57:43,056 --> 01:57:46,460
Sir, you may
question him in regard
to his autopsy report,

2153
01:57:46,560 --> 01:57:48,729
but nothing further
that's legal.

2154
01:57:48,829 --> 01:57:51,132
- But why? Look, I--
- Judge: if you had consulted

2155
01:57:51,232 --> 01:57:53,234
your attorney,
he'd tell you why.

2156
01:57:55,136 --> 01:57:58,705
UH, OKAY.

2157
01:58:00,641 --> 01:58:02,676
- IS EUTHANASIA
ALWAYS MURDER?
- Skrzynski: OBJECTION.

2158
01:58:04,111 --> 01:58:06,613
ALWAYS HOMICIDE?

2159
01:58:06,713 --> 01:58:10,083
- YES, SIR.
- YES, IT'S ALWAYS HOMICIDE.

2160
01:58:10,184 --> 01:58:13,086
AND YOU STATED
THAT HOMICIDE

2161
01:58:13,187 --> 01:58:16,823
IS NOT NECESSARILY
ALWAYS MURDER.

2162
01:58:16,923 --> 01:58:19,460
THEREFORE...

2163
01:58:19,560 --> 01:58:22,028
OUT OF PURE LOGIC,
WOULDN'T YOU SAY

2164
01:58:22,129 --> 01:58:24,631
THAT EUTHANASIA IS
NOT ALWAYS MURDER?

2165
01:58:24,731 --> 01:58:26,500
Skrzynski:
OBJECTION. CALLS FOR
A LEGAL CONCLUSION.

2166
01:58:26,600 --> 01:58:29,270
Jack:
NO, IT CALLS
FOR SIMPLE LOGIC.

2167
01:58:29,370 --> 01:58:32,306
IT'S-- IT'S--
IT'S A SYLLOGISM.

2168
01:58:32,406 --> 01:58:34,441
IT CALLS FOR NOTHING
BUT SYLLOGISM.

2169
01:58:34,541 --> 01:58:37,344
AGAIN, YOU'RE ASKING HIM
TO MAKE A LEGAL CONCLUSION.

2170
01:58:37,444 --> 01:58:39,413
NO, BUT THIS IS
A MATHEMATICAL CONCLUSION.

2171
01:58:39,513 --> 01:58:41,114
IT'S SIMPLE ARITHMETIC.

2172
01:58:41,215 --> 01:58:43,350
I DON'T KNOW SHIT
ABOUT THE LAW EITHER,

2173
01:58:43,450 --> 01:58:45,686
BUT I KNOW WHEN
I'M WATCHING A TRAIN WRECK.

2174
01:58:45,786 --> 01:58:47,954
YEAH, WELL, I TOLD HIM
GOROSH IS A PUTZ.

2175
01:58:48,054 --> 01:58:50,224
It can't possibly be
a fair fight.

2176
01:58:50,324 --> 01:58:54,195
YOU GOTTA
DO SOMETHING,
GEOFF. ANYTHING.

2177
01:58:56,930 --> 01:58:58,565
- DR. KEVORKIAN.
- OH.

2178
01:58:58,665 --> 01:59:01,502
TOM'S BROTHER'S FLIGHT
FROM FRANCE

2179
01:59:01,602 --> 01:59:04,705
GOT DELAYED,
BUT HE WILL BE HERE SOON.

2180
01:59:04,805 --> 01:59:06,507
OKAY, DON'T WORRY.

2181
01:59:06,607 --> 01:59:09,543
WE'RE GONNA GET YOU BOTH
ON THE STAND TO TESTIFY.

2182
01:59:09,643 --> 01:59:13,280
I KNOW YOU WANT
TO CALL MELODY YOUK
AS YOUR FIRST WITNESS,

2183
01:59:13,380 --> 01:59:15,682
BUT WHAT IS IT THAT
SHE'S GOING TO TESTIFY TO?

2184
01:59:15,782 --> 01:59:19,353
WELL, SHE'S GOING TO
TESTIFY ABOUT MY INTENT,

2185
01:59:19,453 --> 01:59:22,689
WHAT SHE OBSERVED
AND OUR DISCUSSIONS--

2186
01:59:22,789 --> 01:59:25,692
DR. KEVORKIAN,
THAT HAS NO RELEVANCE HERE.

2187
01:59:25,792 --> 01:59:28,895
I ASSUMED YOUR COUNSEL
WOULD'VE ADVISED YOU
ABOUT THIS,

2188
01:59:28,995 --> 01:59:32,599
THAT ONCE
THE ASSISTED SUICIDE
CHARGE WAS DROPPED,

2189
01:59:32,699 --> 01:59:35,202
YOU COULD NO LONGER
PUT THESE WITNESSES
BEFORE THE JURY.

2190
01:59:35,302 --> 01:59:37,003
YEAH, BUT I'M TALKING
ABOUT WHAT WENT ON,

2191
01:59:37,103 --> 01:59:38,672
YOU KNOW,
AS TO MY INTENT.

2192
01:59:38,772 --> 01:59:41,475
YOUR FEELING COMPELLED
TO HELP MR. YOUK

2193
01:59:41,575 --> 01:59:43,477
IS NOT A LEGAL DEFENSE,

2194
01:59:43,577 --> 01:59:45,912
AND YOU'RE ALREADY AWARE
THAT A PERSON'S CONDITION

2195
01:59:46,012 --> 01:59:47,581
HAS NO BEARING
IN A MURDER CASE.

2196
01:59:47,681 --> 01:59:49,916
BUT THAT I DIDN'T KILL
HER HUSBAND, YOU SEE.

2197
01:59:50,016 --> 01:59:51,985
- THIS IS RELEVANT.
- OKAY. OKAY.

2198
01:59:52,085 --> 01:59:53,487
WE'LL MAKE
A SPECIAL RECORD

2199
01:59:53,587 --> 01:59:55,155
OUTSIDE THE PRESENCE
OF THE JURY.

2200
01:59:55,256 --> 01:59:57,190
I WILL RULE ON THAT.

2201
01:59:57,291 --> 01:59:58,625
- OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT?

2202
01:59:58,725 --> 02:00:00,594
- CAN I-- OKAY.
THANK YOU.
- THANK YOU.

2203
02:00:00,694 --> 02:00:03,930
Jack:
MELODY, DID YOU TELL ME

2204
02:00:04,030 --> 02:00:05,766
IT WAS YOUR INTENTION

2205
02:00:05,866 --> 02:00:07,901
OR TOM'S INTENTION

2206
02:00:08,001 --> 02:00:11,004
- THAT I KILL HIM?
- Melody: OH, NO NO NO NO.

2207
02:00:11,104 --> 02:00:12,573
THAT WAS NOT OUR INTENT.

2208
02:00:12,673 --> 02:00:15,809
AND WHEN I MET YOU,
I FELT IT WAS NOT
YOUR INTENT.

2209
02:00:15,909 --> 02:00:19,280
IT WAS NEVER YOUR INTENT
OR OUR INTENT THAT TOM--

2210
02:00:19,380 --> 02:00:21,382
Jack:
THERE IT IS.
THERE IT IS. YOU SEE?

2211
02:00:21,482 --> 02:00:25,286
--OTHER THAN RELEASED
FROM SUFFERING.

2212
02:00:25,386 --> 02:00:28,789
SO THE WORD "KILL,"
DID IT EVER CROP UP?
OR "MURDER"?

2213
02:00:28,889 --> 02:00:30,991
NO. NO.

2214
02:00:31,091 --> 02:00:32,726
UGLY WORDS.

2215
02:00:32,826 --> 02:00:35,396
UGLY UGLY WORDS.

2216
02:00:39,633 --> 02:00:42,569
YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT MERCY KILLING.

2217
02:00:42,669 --> 02:00:46,172
AND HER STATEMENTS
CAN'T SHOW

2218
02:00:46,273 --> 02:00:48,609
YOUR STATE OF MIND.
THEY ONLY SHOW HERS.

2219
02:00:48,709 --> 02:00:52,413
THEREFORE, I CANNOT
ALLOW HER TO TESTIFY
BEFORE THE JURY.

2220
02:00:52,513 --> 02:00:53,980
BUT WAIT. I WANT
TO SAY SOMETHING--

2221
02:00:54,080 --> 02:00:55,916
THAT-- I HAVE
SO MUCH I WANT TO SAY.

2222
02:00:56,016 --> 02:01:00,053
I HAVE BEEN WAITING
FOR FOUR GODDAMN MONTHS
FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY!

2223
02:01:00,153 --> 02:01:02,923
YOU MAY CALL IT
MERCY KILLING.

2224
02:01:03,023 --> 02:01:04,891
I CALL
IT SOMETHING ELSE.

2225
02:01:04,991 --> 02:01:06,793
I CALL IT
A MEDICAL SERVICE

2226
02:01:06,893 --> 02:01:09,996
FOR AN AGONIZED,
INCURABLY SUFFERING PATIENT.

2227
02:01:10,096 --> 02:01:11,565
THAT'S WHAT I CALL IT.
ALL RIGHT?

2228
02:01:11,665 --> 02:01:13,634
WHY DON'T--
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES
IT MAKE WHAT YOU CALL IT?

2229
02:01:13,734 --> 02:01:17,137
WHEN YOU HAVE THESE
FINE STIPULATIONS OF LAW

2230
02:01:17,237 --> 02:01:19,005
STANDING IN THE WAY
OF A DEDICATED PHYSICIAN--

2231
02:01:19,105 --> 02:01:22,309
AND I AM
A DEDICATED PHYSICIAN.

2232
02:01:22,409 --> 02:01:25,211
I MEAN, MY INTEGRITY
WOULD BE DESTROYED

2233
02:01:25,312 --> 02:01:27,247
IF I TURNED MY BACK
ON THAT PATIENT.

2234
02:01:27,348 --> 02:01:29,916
I WOULD RATHER
BE DEAD.

2235
02:01:30,016 --> 02:01:31,952
IT-- IT'S FAR WORSE.

2236
02:01:32,052 --> 02:01:35,188
YOU COULD--
YOU COULD TAKE MY LIFE.
IT WOULD BE WORSE.

2237
02:01:35,288 --> 02:01:38,459
THIS WAS A SERVICE.
THIS WAS A SERVICE.

2238
02:01:38,559 --> 02:01:41,595
IT HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH "KILL" OR "MURDER"

2239
02:01:41,695 --> 02:01:43,364
- OR WH-- IT WAS A SERVICE.
- ( sobbing )

2240
02:01:43,464 --> 02:01:45,899
IT WAS A MEDICAL SERVICE
THAT WAS BEING DONE.

2241
02:01:45,999 --> 02:01:47,668
I CAN'T BE CLEARER.

2242
02:01:47,768 --> 02:01:49,403
I CAN'T BE CLEARER
THAN THAT, YOUR HONOR.

2243
02:01:52,773 --> 02:01:54,608
I SEE THE EMOTION,

2244
02:01:54,708 --> 02:01:57,611
I UNDERSTAND IT,
BUT IT'S NOT RELEVANT.

2245
02:01:59,680 --> 02:02:02,616
PLEASE STEP DOWN,
MRS. YOUK.

2246
02:02:07,654 --> 02:02:11,825
Jessica cooper
has already ruled that
Dr. Kevorkian's side

2247
02:02:11,925 --> 02:02:14,695
can't put into evidence
that there was suffering here

2248
02:02:14,795 --> 02:02:16,863
by the victim.
Does that make any sense?

2249
02:02:16,963 --> 02:02:18,999
No, 'cause,
see, I think it's
an improper ruling

2250
02:02:19,099 --> 02:02:21,702
both in terms
of the nature of this trial

2251
02:02:21,802 --> 02:02:23,870
and criminal defenses
in general.

2252
02:02:23,970 --> 02:02:27,140
You're entitled
to put forward
any plausible defense

2253
02:02:27,240 --> 02:02:28,642
to explain
the context of your act,

2254
02:02:28,742 --> 02:02:32,212
and she's already limited him
from doing that.

2255
02:02:32,312 --> 02:02:33,747
IT'S LIKE WATCHING
A MAN HANG HIMSELF.

2256
02:02:33,847 --> 02:02:35,549
I'VE BEEN WATCHING
THE TELEVISION.

2257
02:02:35,649 --> 02:02:37,751
ONCE YOU KNEW
THEY WERE DROPPING
THE ASSISTED SUICIDE CHARGE,

2258
02:02:37,851 --> 02:02:39,786
- WHAT WAS YOUR PLAN?
- HE DOESN'T LET ME HELP HIM.

2259
02:02:39,886 --> 02:02:41,888
- HEY, WHAT AM
I SUPPOSED TO DO?
- YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO

2260
02:02:41,988 --> 02:02:43,690
GET CREATIVE,
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE
SUPPOSED TO DO.

2261
02:02:43,790 --> 02:02:45,692
WHY DIDN'T YOU
ARGUE THAT YOUK'S
WIFE AND BROTHER

2262
02:02:45,792 --> 02:02:47,428
WERE EYEWITNESSES
TO THE EVENT

2263
02:02:47,528 --> 02:02:49,129
THAT THE PROSECUTOR'S
CALLING A MURDER?

2264
02:02:49,229 --> 02:02:51,398
THEN JUDGE COOPER
WOULD'VE HAD TO HAVE
LET THEM TESTIFY.

2265
02:02:51,498 --> 02:02:53,233
BUT THAT WINDOW'S
CLOSED NOW.

2266
02:02:53,333 --> 02:02:56,470
- DID YOU EVER PASS
THE FUCKING BAR EXAM?
- ( elevator dings )

2267
02:02:59,773 --> 02:03:01,808
DAVE.

2268
02:03:05,579 --> 02:03:08,181
There are those
who would say about
Dr. Jack Kevorkian,

2269
02:03:08,281 --> 02:03:10,283
"Right message,
wrong messenger."

2270
02:03:10,383 --> 02:03:12,653
And who is
the right messenger?

2271
02:03:14,287 --> 02:03:15,656
UH...

2272
02:03:15,756 --> 02:03:18,459
NOW I'M CONFUSED
ABOUT THIS, DR. KEVORKIAN.

2273
02:03:18,559 --> 02:03:20,293
YOU SAID YOU HAD
ANOTHER WITNESS.

2274
02:03:20,393 --> 02:03:23,697
I'M NOT ALLOWING
HIS TESTIMONY

2275
02:03:23,797 --> 02:03:26,633
ON THE SAME GROUNDS
I DIDN'T ALLOW MRS. YOUK'S.

2276
02:03:26,733 --> 02:03:30,471
I'M SORRY YOU FLEW
ALL THIS WAY, MR. YOUK.

2277
02:03:33,406 --> 02:03:35,108
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO TAKE THE STAND

2278
02:03:35,208 --> 02:03:37,611
IN YOUR OWN DEFENSE,
DR. KEVORKIAN?

2279
02:03:54,661 --> 02:03:57,498
( whispers )
I'M SORRY.

2280
02:03:57,598 --> 02:04:00,333
Cooper:
SIR, WOULD YOU LIKE
TO TAKE THE STAND

2281
02:04:00,433 --> 02:04:03,203
- IN YOUR OWN DEFENSE?
- OH, I HEARD YOU.

2282
02:04:03,303 --> 02:04:05,539
I DID.

2283
02:04:12,145 --> 02:04:13,880
UM.

2284
02:04:19,152 --> 02:04:21,187
YOU KNOW,
I DON'T LIE

2285
02:04:21,287 --> 02:04:25,792
AND I-- I--
I DON'T EXAGGERATE.

2286
02:04:31,598 --> 02:04:33,667
AND, UM, YOU KNOW,
YOU NEVER SAID WHY.

2287
02:04:33,767 --> 02:04:37,838
YOU ACCUSE ME
OF THESE HEINOUS THINGS,

2288
02:04:37,938 --> 02:04:40,541
BUT YOU NEVER SAID WHY.
DID YOU?

2289
02:04:40,641 --> 02:04:43,276
NO, JUST SAYING.
I'M JUST SAYING.

2290
02:04:43,376 --> 02:04:45,779
YOU KNOW,
JUST SO YOU KNOW.

2291
02:04:45,879 --> 02:04:49,550
Cooper:
SIR, LET'S KEEP
TO THE RELEVANCE HERE.

2292
02:04:49,650 --> 02:04:51,518
OH, THIS IS--
OH, IT'S NOT RELEVANT?

2293
02:04:51,618 --> 02:04:54,054
I GUESS IT'S NOT.

2294
02:04:54,154 --> 02:04:55,522
IT'S NOT RELEVANT.

2295
02:04:57,057 --> 02:04:58,859
UH.

2296
02:04:58,959 --> 02:05:00,994
Cooper:
I WILL ASK YOU AGAIN.

2297
02:05:01,094 --> 02:05:05,498
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO TAKE THE STAND IN
YOUR OWN DEFENSE, SIR?

2298
02:05:18,444 --> 02:05:20,313
IT'S NOW OR NEVER.

2299
02:05:20,413 --> 02:05:22,515
NEVER.

2300
02:05:25,218 --> 02:05:27,988
NO. NO.

2301
02:05:29,656 --> 02:05:33,093
THE DEFENSE... RESTS.

2302
02:05:36,797 --> 02:05:39,733
Skrzynski:
NOT SINCE RUBY
KILLED OSWALD

2303
02:05:39,833 --> 02:05:43,203
DID WE SEE A MURDER
ON TELEVISION.

2304
02:05:43,303 --> 02:05:46,940
JACK KEVORKIAN CAME
LIKE A HIT MAN IN THE NIGHT

2305
02:05:47,040 --> 02:05:50,911
WITH A BAG OF POISON
TO DO HIS JOB.

2306
02:05:51,011 --> 02:05:53,947
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
IF HE GOT HIS WAY

2307
02:05:54,047 --> 02:05:56,717
AND MADE
THE STATE POLICY
EUTHANASIA?

2308
02:05:56,817 --> 02:05:58,685
WHAT COULD GO WRONG?

2309
02:05:58,785 --> 02:06:02,055
WELL, THERE ARE
11 MILLION SOULS
BURIED IN EUROPE...

2310
02:06:02,155 --> 02:06:04,257
- OH!
- ...THAT CAN TELL YOU
THAT WHEN YOU MAKE

2311
02:06:04,357 --> 02:06:05,926
EUTHANASIA
A STATE POLICY

2312
02:06:06,026 --> 02:06:07,728
SOME CATASTROPHIC THINGS
CAN EVOLVE

2313
02:06:07,828 --> 02:06:09,696
- FROM OPENING UP THAT BOX.
- HOW DARE YOU?!

2314
02:06:09,796 --> 02:06:11,632
- HOW DARE YOU...
- Cooper: DR. KEVORKIAN!

2315
02:06:11,732 --> 02:06:13,900
- ...COMPARE EUTHANASIA
WITH THE GENOCIDE?!
- ( gavel pounding )

2316
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,770
- HOW DARE YOU!
- Melody: YOU HAVE
CROSSED THE LINE!

2317
02:06:16,870 --> 02:06:19,272
- WHERE IS
YOUR DECENCY AND RESPECT?
- Cooper: ORDER IN THE COURT.

2318
02:06:19,372 --> 02:06:21,808
ORDER IN THIS COURT.

2319
02:06:21,908 --> 02:06:25,178
WE WILL TAKE
A BRIEF RECESS.

2320
02:06:25,278 --> 02:06:27,614
( people whispering )

2321
02:06:33,920 --> 02:06:36,790
DO YOU SEE
A CRIMINAL?

2322
02:06:37,958 --> 02:06:40,260
DO YOU SEE
A MURDERER?

2323
02:06:40,360 --> 02:06:42,395
IF YOU DO,

2324
02:06:42,495 --> 02:06:44,965
THEN YOU--
YOU MUST CONVICT.

2325
02:06:47,067 --> 02:06:51,604
AND THEN TAKE
THE HARSH JUDGMENT
OF HISTORY

2326
02:06:51,705 --> 02:06:56,542
AND THE EVEN
HARSHER JUDGMENT
OF YOUR CHILDREN

2327
02:06:56,643 --> 02:07:00,480
AND THEIR CHILDREN
IF THEY SHOULD EVER COME

2328
02:07:00,580 --> 02:07:03,684
TO NEED THIS CHOICE
IN THEIR LIVES.

2329
02:07:05,118 --> 02:07:08,221
I JUST ASK YOU
TO THINK ABOUT THAT.

2330
02:07:20,300 --> 02:07:23,369
GUILTY OF THE LESSER CHARGE
OF SECOND-DEGREE MURDER.

2331
02:07:23,469 --> 02:07:26,206
- ( murmuring )
- Woman: YES.

2332
02:07:26,306 --> 02:07:27,741
Cooper:
AND WITH REGARD
TO COUNT TWO,

2333
02:07:27,841 --> 02:07:29,442
WHAT IS YOUR VERDICT?

2334
02:07:29,542 --> 02:07:33,680
Woman Â£2:
Guilty of delivery
of a controlled substance.

2335
02:07:39,720 --> 02:07:42,756
Woman:
HE'S OUT OF TIME. YES.

2336
02:07:44,725 --> 02:07:48,028
You invited yourself here
to make a final stand.

2337
02:07:48,128 --> 02:07:50,864
You invited yourself
to the wrong forum.

2338
02:07:50,964 --> 02:07:54,434
OUR NATION TOLERATES
DIFFERENCES OF OPINIONS

2339
02:07:54,534 --> 02:07:56,970
BECAUSE WE HAVE A CIVILIZED
AND NON-VIOLENT WAY

2340
02:07:57,070 --> 02:07:58,972
OF RESOLVING
OUR CONFLICTS.

2341
02:07:59,072 --> 02:08:01,241
WE HAVE THE MEANS
AND METHODS

2342
02:08:01,341 --> 02:08:03,609
TO PROTEST LAWS
WITH WHICH WE DISAGREE.

2343
02:08:03,710 --> 02:08:06,346
YOU CAN CRITICIZE
THE LAW,

2344
02:08:06,446 --> 02:08:07,981
LECTURE ABOUT THE LAW,

2345
02:08:08,081 --> 02:08:10,784
SPEAK TO THE MEDIA
OR PETITION VOTERS,

2346
02:08:10,884 --> 02:08:13,253
BUT YOU MUST ALWAYS STAY

2347
02:08:13,353 --> 02:08:15,055
WITHIN THE LIMITS
PROVIDED BY THE LAW.

2348
02:08:15,155 --> 02:08:17,190
YOU MAY NOT
BREAK THE LAW

2349
02:08:17,290 --> 02:08:19,826
OR TAKE THE LAW
INTO YOUR OWN HANDS.

2350
02:08:19,926 --> 02:08:22,628
NO ONE'S UNMINDFUL

2351
02:08:22,729 --> 02:08:25,832
OF THE CONTROVERSY
AND EMOTION THAT EXISTS

2352
02:08:25,932 --> 02:08:28,534
OVER END-OF-LIFE ISSUES
AND PAIN CONTROL.

2353
02:08:28,634 --> 02:08:31,304
I ASSUME
THE DEBATE WILL CONTINUE

2354
02:08:31,404 --> 02:08:34,540
IN A CALM
AND REASONED FORUM
LONG AFTER THIS TRIAL

2355
02:08:34,640 --> 02:08:38,378
AND YOUR ACTIVITIES HAVE
FADED FROM THE PUBLIC MEMORY.

2356
02:08:38,478 --> 02:08:41,782
BUT THIS TRIAL WAS NOT
ABOUT THAT CONTROVERSY.

2357
02:08:41,882 --> 02:08:45,418
THIS TRIAL WAS
ABOUT YOU, SIR.

2358
02:08:45,518 --> 02:08:47,187
YOU'VE IGNORED
AND CHALLENGED

2359
02:08:47,287 --> 02:08:49,956
THE LEGISLATURE
AND THE SUPREME COURT.

2360
02:08:50,056 --> 02:08:53,026
MOREOVER, YOU'VE DEFIED
YOUR OWN MEDICAL PROFESSION.

2361
02:08:53,126 --> 02:08:56,029
THIS TRIAL WAS
ABOUT LAWLESSNESS,

2362
02:08:56,129 --> 02:08:58,999
ABOUT YOUR DISREGARD
FOR A SOCIETY

2363
02:08:59,099 --> 02:09:00,867
THAT EXISTS
AND FLOURISHES

2364
02:09:00,967 --> 02:09:03,369
BECAUSE OF THE STRENGTH
OF OUR LEGAL SYSTEM.

2365
02:09:03,469 --> 02:09:06,372
NO ONE IS
ABOVE THE LAW.

2366
02:09:08,308 --> 02:09:11,878
YOU HAD THE AUDACITY TO GO
ON NATIONAL TELEVISION,

2367
02:09:11,978 --> 02:09:13,346
SHOW THE WORLD
WHAT YOU DID,

2368
02:09:13,446 --> 02:09:15,916
AND DARE THE LEGAL SYSTEM
TO STOP YOU.

2369
02:09:16,016 --> 02:09:19,552
YOU PUBLICLY AND REPEATEDLY
ANNOUNCED YOUR INTENTIONS

2370
02:09:19,652 --> 02:09:21,922
TO DISREGARD
THE LAWS OF MICHIGAN.

2371
02:09:22,022 --> 02:09:24,690
BECAUSE OF THIS,
I AM IMPOSING

2372
02:09:24,791 --> 02:09:27,894
THE MAXIMUM SENTENCE
OF 10 TO 25 YEARS.

2373
02:09:27,994 --> 02:09:29,695
YOU MAY NOW, SIR,

2374
02:09:29,796 --> 02:09:31,832
CONSIDER YOURSELF STOPPED.

2375
02:09:31,932 --> 02:09:35,068
- ( clapping )
- Man: YEAH, DOC!
YEAH, DOC!

2376
02:09:35,168 --> 02:09:37,871
Man Â£2:
YOU THE MAN, JACK!
YOU THE MAN!

2377
02:09:37,971 --> 02:09:40,306
( men cheering )

2378
02:09:42,809 --> 02:09:45,879
Man Â£3:
HEY, JACK!

2379
02:10:06,766 --> 02:10:09,102
( silence )

2380
02:10:11,972 --> 02:10:14,174
( door clangs )

2381
02:10:38,664 --> 02:10:42,202
- ( jazz music playing )
- ( people vocalizing )

2382
02:11:23,809 --> 02:11:29,950
( classical score playing )
