1
00:00:35,581 --> 00:00:37,150
Goodbye Ms. Suzy.

2
00:01:21,862 --> 00:01:22,862
Dad!

3
00:01:25,198 --> 00:01:26,198
Dad!

4
00:01:45,251 --> 00:01:46,719
It's okay, girl.

5
00:01:49,089 --> 00:01:51,491
Yeah, it's gonna
be alright soon.

6
00:01:53,126 --> 00:01:55,395
All mothers go through it, yeah.

7
00:01:56,829 --> 00:02:00,366
About 30 days from now, we'll
get them foal out of you.

8
00:02:01,501 --> 00:02:03,736
Everything'll be okay,
how's that sound?

9
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:14,814
Yeah, good girl.

10
00:02:17,017 --> 00:02:19,489
I gotta say you look good.

11
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:22,088
This'll all be over soon, yeah.

12
00:02:23,924 --> 00:02:25,761
The horse whisperer.

13
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:27,097
Hey.

14
00:02:27,127 --> 00:02:28,298
How long you been
standing there?

15
00:02:28,328 --> 00:02:29,866
Long enough to see the old man

16
00:02:29,896 --> 00:02:31,301
hasn't lost his touch.

17
00:02:31,331 --> 00:02:32,735
Old man.

18
00:02:32,765 --> 00:02:33,970
Well you aren't
getting any younger.

19
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,305
Hey, you'd better
watch it, young lady.

20
00:02:35,335 --> 00:02:37,537
I'll have you bailing
hay to earn your keep.

21
00:02:39,339 --> 00:02:40,743
Got my SATs back.

22
00:02:40,773 --> 00:02:41,945
Oh yeah?

23
00:02:41,975 --> 00:02:42,975
Look.

24
00:02:45,778 --> 00:02:47,517
I'm in the 99th percentile.

25
00:02:47,547 --> 00:02:49,085
I aced it.

26
00:02:49,115 --> 00:02:51,584
It's enough to get me into
the University of Chicago.

27
00:02:53,153 --> 00:02:54,072
Congratulations, honey.

28
00:02:54,087 --> 00:02:56,722
I'm proud of you.

29
00:02:58,925 --> 00:03:00,130
What's the matter?

30
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:00,946
Nothing.

31
00:03:00,961 --> 00:03:01,779
Nothing?

32
00:03:01,794 --> 00:03:03,366
No.

33
00:03:03,396 --> 00:03:04,864
You're jealous.

34
00:03:05,865 --> 00:03:07,003
I'm not jealous.

35
00:03:07,033 --> 00:03:08,204
I'm the first
person in this family

36
00:03:08,234 --> 00:03:10,373
to go to college
and you're jealous.

37
00:03:10,403 --> 00:03:11,641
Honey, I'm not jealous.

38
00:03:11,671 --> 00:03:13,977
Why can't you just
be happy for me?

39
00:03:14,007 --> 00:03:14,926
I'm happy for you.

40
00:03:14,941 --> 00:03:16,112
You're walking away.

41
00:03:16,142 --> 00:03:17,280
I'm not walking away.

42
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,781
When mom was
sick and you didn't

43
00:03:18,811 --> 00:03:20,480
wanna tell me how bad it
was, you just walked away.

44
00:03:22,015 --> 00:03:23,253
It's fine.

45
00:03:23,283 --> 00:03:24,283
Honey.

46
00:03:55,081 --> 00:03:56,286
Kelly!

47
00:03:56,316 --> 00:03:57,268
What?

48
00:03:57,283 --> 00:03:58,551
Get in the storm cellar!

49
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,620
What?

50
00:04:06,059 --> 00:04:08,628
Get in the storm shelter now!

51
00:05:01,881 --> 00:05:02,881
Dad!

52
00:05:31,377 --> 00:05:32,377
Kelly!

53
00:05:34,247 --> 00:05:35,415
Dad!

54
00:06:45,818 --> 00:06:46,818
What?

55
00:06:52,858 --> 00:06:53,778
This is Brad.

56
00:06:53,793 --> 00:06:55,698
Hey Brad, it's Gail Curtis.

57
00:06:55,728 --> 00:06:58,168
Gail Curtis, how did
you get my cellphone number?

58
00:06:58,198 --> 00:06:59,302
You're not
the only person I know

59
00:06:59,332 --> 00:07:01,036
at the National Weather Service.

60
00:07:01,066 --> 00:07:02,572
It's too early
in the morning, Gail.

61
00:07:02,602 --> 00:07:05,275
Listen, I'm getting
reports of tornado activity

62
00:07:05,305 --> 00:07:08,444
in six counties
and there's nothing

63
00:07:08,474 --> 00:07:10,946
on your website about
it and diddly squat

64
00:07:10,976 --> 00:07:12,682
on any of the news nets.

65
00:07:12,712 --> 00:07:13,779
You care to comment?

66
00:07:14,947 --> 00:07:15,766
Hello, Brad?

67
00:07:15,781 --> 00:07:16,781
When was this?

68
00:07:18,418 --> 00:07:21,123
Yesterday evening
through this morning.

69
00:07:21,153 --> 00:07:23,092
There hasn't been
any tornado activity

70
00:07:23,122 --> 00:07:25,261
in Illinois in
the last 48 hours.

71
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,730
So 132 people are lying?

72
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,763
No, I'm saying that you
have enthusiastic readers.

73
00:07:32,465 --> 00:07:34,003
And that's the
official government line?

74
00:07:34,033 --> 00:07:35,305
Nothing happened?

75
00:07:35,335 --> 00:07:36,739
You have a
good day, Ms. Curtis.

76
00:07:36,769 --> 00:07:37,769
Brad.

77
00:07:41,774 --> 00:07:43,576
What the hell was
that all about?

78
00:07:53,686 --> 00:07:54,686
Hello.

79
00:07:56,055 --> 00:07:57,557
Where the hell
did you come from?

80
00:08:00,293 --> 00:08:01,293
Oh my god!

81
00:08:02,027 --> 00:08:03,027
What?

82
00:08:19,445 --> 00:08:20,680
This place is terrible.

83
00:08:21,847 --> 00:08:22,948
All this damage.

84
00:08:24,116 --> 00:08:25,851
Brother, I cannot believe it.

85
00:08:28,621 --> 00:08:29,925
Tell me it's not
as bad as it looks.

86
00:08:29,955 --> 00:08:30,955
It's worse.

87
00:08:32,392 --> 00:08:33,396
Hi Kelly.

88
00:08:33,426 --> 00:08:34,697
Hey Norm.

89
00:08:34,727 --> 00:08:36,799
Well you're not the only one.

90
00:08:36,829 --> 00:08:39,565
Everybody in this county's
seeing tornadoes.

91
00:08:40,966 --> 00:08:41,786
Look, I don't know how
you people deal with this

92
00:08:41,801 --> 00:08:43,273
from year to year.

93
00:08:43,303 --> 00:08:46,041
I came here from the big
city for a life of ease

94
00:08:46,071 --> 00:08:48,278
and I feel like I
walked into a bullseye.

95
00:08:48,308 --> 00:08:50,446
If you go back,
take me with you.

96
00:08:50,476 --> 00:08:51,681
Chicago?

97
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:53,916
Girl, I thought you
liked this country life.

98
00:08:53,946 --> 00:08:55,451
Yeah, sure, Norm.

99
00:08:55,481 --> 00:08:57,720
When I said I couldn't wait to
try Union Street,

100
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,669
I was just kidding.

101
00:08:58,684 --> 00:09:00,089
Kelly, don't talk like that.

102
00:09:00,119 --> 00:09:02,121
I'm sorry, I'm a little
stressed right now.

103
00:09:03,155 --> 00:09:05,395
All our livestock are dead.

104
00:09:05,425 --> 00:09:07,129
All of them?

105
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:09,495
All but one pregnant mare.

106
00:09:11,797 --> 00:09:13,536
Sorry about that, buddy.

107
00:09:13,566 --> 00:09:16,138
It's not the end
of the world, right?

108
00:09:16,168 --> 00:09:18,971
Our insurance will
cover it, right dad?

109
00:09:22,908 --> 00:09:23,908
Dad?

110
00:09:28,748 --> 00:09:30,383
Is there something
I should know?

111
00:09:32,318 --> 00:09:34,487
Honey, you remember
the twister back in '08?

112
00:09:35,688 --> 00:09:36,688
Yeah.

113
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:40,029
The insurance company
said our buildings

114
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:43,132
weren't up to code so
our claim was denied.

115
00:09:43,162 --> 00:09:44,867
Wait, what?

116
00:09:44,897 --> 00:09:47,199
I didn't tell you because
I didn't want you to worry.

117
00:09:49,469 --> 00:09:50,803
How did we get the money?

118
00:09:52,705 --> 00:09:54,507
I had to use mom's
life insurance.

119
00:09:57,977 --> 00:09:59,479
That was my college fund.

120
00:10:00,713 --> 00:10:02,117
Honey, I'm sorry.

121
00:10:02,147 --> 00:10:03,616
I thought I could make it up.

122
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,124
Kelly.

123
00:10:09,154 --> 00:10:10,560
What?

124
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:11,590
Where are you going?

125
00:10:13,292 --> 00:10:14,564
I'm going to Vickie's.

126
00:10:14,594 --> 00:10:15,898
Why?

127
00:10:15,928 --> 00:10:18,033
To help her decide
what courses to take

128
00:10:18,063 --> 00:10:19,632
and university.

129
00:10:26,472 --> 00:10:28,073
Man, I don't know what to say.

130
00:10:30,776 --> 00:10:32,778
Just tell me
you got the booze.

131
00:10:35,548 --> 00:10:36,548
In the trunk.

132
00:10:59,405 --> 00:11:01,106
Judd, you
gotta let it go.

133
00:11:02,374 --> 00:11:03,846
You gotta stop living
in the past, man.

134
00:11:03,876 --> 00:11:05,748
I mean you just gotta let it go.

135
00:11:05,778 --> 00:11:08,751
You tell me what's so
good about the present.

136
00:11:08,781 --> 00:11:10,950
My farm's a wreck,
I'm dead broke.

137
00:11:12,117 --> 00:11:13,218
My daughter hates me.

138
00:11:14,754 --> 00:11:17,192
Sound like a bad
country western song.

139
00:11:17,222 --> 00:11:19,429
Look, Kelly's a good girl.

140
00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:20,730
She gonna get over it.

141
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,231
Nah, you don't know her.

142
00:11:22,261 --> 00:11:24,430
She's been dreaming about
leaving Lando all her life.

143
00:11:25,798 --> 00:11:28,701
Well I guess I got a
little bit to do with that.

144
00:11:30,803 --> 00:11:33,142
I'd appreciate it if
you stop filling her head

145
00:11:33,172 --> 00:11:34,810
with all those big city dreams.

146
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,546
You got to tell people
about the best hot dog place

147
00:11:36,576 --> 00:11:37,747
in Chicago.

148
00:11:37,777 --> 00:11:39,582
The Filling Station
on Union Avenue.

149
00:11:39,612 --> 00:11:42,548
Gus has been in a business
for what, 50 years?

150
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,685
What does this
have to do with hot dogs?

151
00:11:47,019 --> 00:11:48,020
Look man.

152
00:11:49,321 --> 00:11:50,207
The things happen.

153
00:11:50,222 --> 00:11:52,261
It's just bad luck.

154
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:53,596
I mean, you act
like this damn thing

155
00:11:53,626 --> 00:11:55,397
is chasing after you personally.

156
00:11:55,427 --> 00:11:56,380
Oh, you didn't see it.

157
00:11:56,395 --> 00:11:57,247
See what?

158
00:11:57,262 --> 00:11:58,267
Tornado.

159
00:11:58,297 --> 00:11:59,502
Been there, done that.

160
00:11:59,532 --> 00:12:00,870
No, this wasn't
your run of the mill,

161
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,971
garden variety twister.

162
00:12:02,001 --> 00:12:02,953
I've seen a lot of things, Norm,

163
00:12:02,968 --> 00:12:04,540
but this was not right.

164
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:05,389
This was different.

165
00:12:05,404 --> 00:12:06,876
Different?

166
00:12:06,906 --> 00:12:09,044
Yeah, it was just hanging
over that government compound

167
00:12:09,074 --> 00:12:10,312
down there, just hovering,

168
00:12:10,342 --> 00:12:11,981
and all these weird
lights in the clouds

169
00:12:12,011 --> 00:12:14,049
and it was shooting out
these lightning bolts.

170
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,285
Man, this beer
thing was a bad idea.

171
00:12:16,315 --> 00:12:17,953
This got nothing
to do with drinking!

172
00:12:17,983 --> 00:12:19,819
I'm not nuts, I know what I saw!

173
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,321
Why you yelling at me?

174
00:12:23,656 --> 00:12:24,857
I'm trying to help you.

175
00:12:26,391 --> 00:12:28,728
How the hell
you gonna help me?

176
00:12:29,562 --> 00:12:30,766
You're gonna help me.

177
00:12:30,796 --> 00:12:32,167
You couldn't even hack
it as a big city cop

178
00:12:32,197 --> 00:12:33,636
and you're sitting there
telling me you're gonna help me.

179
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:34,837
Judd, you don't know
what you're talking about.

180
00:12:34,867 --> 00:12:36,105
No, I don't know
what I'm talking about

181
00:12:36,135 --> 00:12:38,173
'cause you never told me
why you left the city.

182
00:12:38,203 --> 00:12:39,709
Need to shut up.

183
00:12:39,739 --> 00:12:41,140
Why did you come to Lando?

184
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:44,179
And don't give me that garbage

185
00:12:44,209 --> 00:12:46,311
that you came down here for
that laid back country living.

186
00:12:47,446 --> 00:12:48,398
I think it's
time for me to go.

187
00:12:48,413 --> 00:12:50,219
Maybe that's a good idea.

188
00:12:50,249 --> 00:12:51,921
The beer's on me.

189
00:12:51,951 --> 00:12:52,951
Big deal.

190
00:12:54,453 --> 00:12:56,689
Look, give me a call
when you sleep it off.

191
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:59,024
Well don't hold your breath.

192
00:13:01,594 --> 00:13:02,862
Have a good one, buddy.

193
00:13:43,636 --> 00:13:44,637
Oh my god.

194
00:13:46,338 --> 00:13:48,210
Gail Curtis in the flesh!

195
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,046
It's so good to
finally meet you!

196
00:13:51,076 --> 00:13:52,848
Denise Gordon.

197
00:13:52,878 --> 00:13:54,249
You're Climate Chick.

198
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:55,517
That's right, honey.

199
00:13:55,547 --> 00:13:57,249
Your number one fan.

200
00:13:58,651 --> 00:13:59,789
Look at you.

201
00:13:59,819 --> 00:14:02,725
So much prettier in person.

202
00:14:02,755 --> 00:14:04,393
What is it?

203
00:14:04,423 --> 00:14:06,395
You're just not
what I expected.

204
00:14:06,425 --> 00:14:07,697
A little older.

205
00:14:07,727 --> 00:14:09,298
A little wiser I hope.

206
00:14:09,328 --> 00:14:10,733
Yeah, that's it.

207
00:14:10,763 --> 00:14:12,698
Come on, let's
get you checked in.

208
00:14:13,733 --> 00:14:15,304
Frank, he's the manager.

209
00:14:15,334 --> 00:14:18,307
He'll wanna put you in
the big spender suite.

210
00:14:18,337 --> 00:14:20,776
It's the one they
reserve for the VIPs

211
00:14:20,806 --> 00:14:23,713
but I recommend the
honeymoon grotto.

212
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:26,515
Harry, that's my
husband, took me there

213
00:14:26,545 --> 00:14:29,084
for our 10th
wedding anniversary.

214
00:14:29,114 --> 00:14:30,620
Rest his soul.

215
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:31,468
Did you feel that?

216
00:14:31,483 --> 00:14:32,722
What?

217
00:14:32,752 --> 00:14:34,386
Sudden drop in the
barometric pressure.

218
00:14:36,221 --> 00:14:37,793
Tornado.

219
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,094
How did you know?

220
00:14:39,124 --> 00:14:40,630
10 years of storm chasing.

221
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,660
It's sixth sense.

222
00:14:42,795 --> 00:14:45,500
That's it, that's what I saw.

223
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:48,003
I've never seen
anything like it.

224
00:14:48,033 --> 00:14:49,368
That makes two of us.

225
00:14:52,104 --> 00:14:53,275
Chasing it.

226
00:14:53,305 --> 00:14:54,309
Let's do it.

227
00:14:54,339 --> 00:14:55,745
No, Denise.

228
00:14:55,775 --> 00:14:56,912
This could be dangerous.

229
00:14:56,942 --> 00:14:59,181
Well I can't let you go alone.

230
00:14:59,211 --> 00:15:00,612
You don't know the area.

231
00:15:02,114 --> 00:15:03,182
Okay, come on.

232
00:15:04,449 --> 00:15:06,585
Hey Ben, lock up my scooter.

233
00:15:13,358 --> 00:15:14,178
Let's go.

234
00:15:14,193 --> 00:15:15,193
I'm doing it.

235
00:15:35,314 --> 00:15:36,485
Hello?

236
00:15:36,515 --> 00:15:37,519
It's me.

237
00:15:37,549 --> 00:15:38,888
Kelly.

238
00:15:38,918 --> 00:15:40,055
My bike blew a tire.

239
00:15:40,085 --> 00:15:43,392
Can you come without
lecturing me?

240
00:15:43,422 --> 00:15:44,660
Where are you?

241
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:46,796
I'm just down the
road from Vickie's.

242
00:15:46,826 --> 00:15:47,812
Don't move.

243
00:15:47,827 --> 00:15:49,228
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

244
00:16:08,013 --> 00:16:10,252
I don't think
we're gonna catch it.

245
00:16:10,282 --> 00:16:12,051
Here, see if you
can get more video.

246
00:16:14,253 --> 00:16:16,158
I can't believe a
celebrity like you

247
00:16:16,188 --> 00:16:18,728
doesn't already
have an assistant.

248
00:16:18,758 --> 00:16:21,196
Harry always told me
I was wasting time

249
00:16:21,226 --> 00:16:23,362
with websites like yours.

250
00:16:24,496 --> 00:16:28,103
If he'd listened, maybe
he'd still be here.

251
00:16:28,133 --> 00:16:30,005
Hang on,
I'm pulling over.

252
00:16:30,035 --> 00:16:31,640
Well alright.

253
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,405
What's going on?

254
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:37,346
Stay put.

255
00:16:37,376 --> 00:16:38,376
Okay.

256
00:16:51,123 --> 00:16:52,357
Unbelievable!

257
00:17:03,668 --> 00:17:04,668
Oh crap!

258
00:17:27,092 --> 00:17:28,493
Have you been drinking?

259
00:17:30,762 --> 00:17:32,667
What kind of question is that?

260
00:17:32,697 --> 00:17:35,237
Dad, I'm 17.

261
00:17:35,267 --> 00:17:37,406
I do know what
alcohol smells like.

262
00:17:37,436 --> 00:17:38,573
Honey, I don't know
what you want me to say.

263
00:17:38,603 --> 00:17:40,005
I've already said I'm sorry.

264
00:17:41,573 --> 00:17:43,408
Yeah, sure.

265
00:17:48,713 --> 00:17:50,452
Do we have to listen to that?

266
00:17:50,482 --> 00:17:51,720
Why not?

267
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,189
Well for starters
it's a little loud.

268
00:17:54,219 --> 00:17:55,219
So old.

269
00:17:56,055 --> 00:17:57,659
What?

270
00:17:57,689 --> 00:18:00,559
I said you are so old.

271
00:18:04,529 --> 00:18:05,567
I don't wanna fight with you.

272
00:18:05,597 --> 00:18:06,899
Who's fighting?

273
00:18:11,503 --> 00:18:12,641
Do you mind?

274
00:18:12,671 --> 00:18:13,671
Do you mind?

275
00:18:14,874 --> 00:18:16,745
In case you've forgotten,
I'm still your father.

276
00:18:16,775 --> 00:18:18,480
I'd appreciate it if you'd stop

277
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,949
treating me like
I was the enemy.

278
00:18:19,979 --> 00:18:23,185
Well news flash, dad, I
just found out my entire life

279
00:18:23,215 --> 00:18:24,216
is over.

280
00:18:25,384 --> 00:18:26,588
So dramatic.

281
00:18:26,618 --> 00:18:27,890
Your life isn't over,
it's just beginning.

282
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,259
Well dad, what do
you expect me to do?

283
00:18:30,289 --> 00:18:32,761
Spend the rest of
my life on a farm?

284
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:35,064
What's wrong with that?

285
00:18:35,094 --> 00:18:36,198
What's wrong with that?

286
00:18:36,228 --> 00:18:37,147
Yeah, what's wrong with that?

287
00:18:37,162 --> 00:18:38,567
Dad, I wanna be a scientist.

288
00:18:38,597 --> 00:18:41,300
Not a damn shepherd.

289
00:18:43,835 --> 00:18:44,835
What?

290
00:18:48,307 --> 00:18:49,408
What is that?

291
00:18:50,409 --> 00:18:51,409
Beats me.

292
00:18:54,413 --> 00:18:55,985
What the?

293
00:18:56,015 --> 00:18:57,449
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

294
00:18:59,684 --> 00:19:01,220
Oh my god.

295
00:19:12,264 --> 00:19:13,264
You jerk!

296
00:19:14,967 --> 00:19:18,470
Where's he going
like a bat out of hell?

297
00:19:24,609 --> 00:19:25,610
Oh my god.

298
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:28,948
Oh my god, dad.

299
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,858
Dad.

300
00:19:36,888 --> 00:19:38,027
What are you doing?

301
00:19:38,057 --> 00:19:39,061
Going after 'em.

302
00:19:39,091 --> 00:19:39,910
I gotta warn 'em.

303
00:19:39,925 --> 00:19:40,844
Are you serious?

304
00:19:40,859 --> 00:19:42,031
They'll get themselves killed.

305
00:19:42,061 --> 00:19:44,729
They're from the city obviously.

306
00:19:51,536 --> 00:19:52,536
Hey!

307
00:19:55,975 --> 00:19:57,512
That's a tornado up ahead!

308
00:19:57,542 --> 00:19:58,543
Turn around!

309
00:20:04,116 --> 00:20:05,116
Hey!

310
00:20:17,796 --> 00:20:19,798
Hold on, honey, hold on.

311
00:20:34,246 --> 00:20:36,415
The hell's wrong with you?

312
00:20:49,561 --> 00:20:50,447
You alright?

313
00:20:50,462 --> 00:20:51,596
My god, yes.

314
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,071
Honey, get under that bridge.

315
00:20:56,101 --> 00:20:57,272
What?

316
00:20:57,302 --> 00:20:57,988
Get under that
bridge and stay there

317
00:20:58,003 --> 00:20:58,822
til I come back.

318
00:20:58,837 --> 00:20:59,837
I'll be back, please.

319
00:21:03,475 --> 00:21:04,475
Dad.

320
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:09,780
Great.

321
00:22:09,508 --> 00:22:11,880
Aren't we a little close?

322
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:14,783
wants us
to provoke a response!

323
00:22:14,813 --> 00:22:17,819
We can't get out
of the.

324
00:22:17,849 --> 00:22:20,955
I don't like being the bait!

325
00:22:20,985 --> 00:22:22,987
I love being the bait!

326
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,807
Tell me we have something.

327
00:22:46,445 --> 00:22:48,046
Another one bites the dust.

328
00:22:52,951 --> 00:22:54,519
This is not good, Mr. Parnell.

329
00:22:55,687 --> 00:22:57,292
Please.

330
00:22:57,322 --> 00:22:58,322
Take care of it.

331
00:22:59,758 --> 00:23:01,893
Time to get out of dodge.

332
00:23:19,811 --> 00:23:21,716
Who are these guys?

333
00:23:21,746 --> 00:23:23,382
Power company maybe?

334
00:23:24,383 --> 00:23:26,221
Not dressed like that.

335
00:23:26,251 --> 00:23:27,456
I smell FBI.

336
00:23:27,486 --> 00:23:28,657
Can I help you ladies?

337
00:23:28,687 --> 00:23:30,525
No, we're just tourists.

338
00:23:30,555 --> 00:23:33,528
I'm gonna have to ask you
to do that somewhere else.

339
00:23:33,558 --> 00:23:35,327
You don't look
like a rent-a-cop.

340
00:23:37,629 --> 00:23:38,730
I'm a federal agent.

341
00:23:39,898 --> 00:23:41,136
Oh.

342
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:43,505
So you're trying to
hide something, huh?

343
00:23:43,535 --> 00:23:44,639
What is it?

344
00:23:44,669 --> 00:23:46,875
Some new kind of
twister caused by, what,

345
00:23:46,905 --> 00:23:49,278
runaway global warming?

346
00:23:49,308 --> 00:23:50,879
I don't know what
you're talking about.

347
00:23:50,909 --> 00:23:52,814
Now are you going
to put that away

348
00:23:52,844 --> 00:23:54,646
or am I gonna have
to confiscate it?

349
00:23:56,114 --> 00:23:57,886
Are you serious?

350
00:23:57,916 --> 00:23:59,218
Yes.

351
00:24:01,085 --> 00:24:02,291
Um yeah.

352
00:24:02,321 --> 00:24:03,525
Ow, I am aware of
the Patriot Act.

353
00:24:03,555 --> 00:24:04,759
That doesn't give you the right

354
00:24:04,789 --> 00:24:07,095
to take away my own
personal property.

355
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:08,129
Is there a problem here?

356
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:09,464
Oh, Sheriff Mackey.

357
00:24:09,494 --> 00:24:10,699
Thank goodness.

358
00:24:10,729 --> 00:24:14,469
This fascist goon just
stole my friend's phone.

359
00:24:14,499 --> 00:24:16,205
Is that what happened, ma'am?

360
00:24:16,235 --> 00:24:17,606
Yeah.

361
00:24:17,636 --> 00:24:18,740
I'm a federal agent and this

362
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:20,975
is a national security
investigation.

363
00:24:21,005 --> 00:24:22,344
National security?

364
00:24:22,374 --> 00:24:23,578
Since when...

365
00:24:23,608 --> 00:24:24,846
Can I help you folks?

366
00:24:24,876 --> 00:24:25,862
Are you the person in charge?

367
00:24:25,877 --> 00:24:27,816
That's right, Agent Armstrong.

368
00:24:27,846 --> 00:24:29,784
I'm with the federal
task force in charge

369
00:24:29,814 --> 00:24:31,453
of infrastructure security.

370
00:24:31,483 --> 00:24:33,017
These are my credentials.

371
00:24:34,819 --> 00:24:37,426
Integrated threat
response unit?

372
00:24:37,456 --> 00:24:39,027
Never heard of that.

373
00:24:39,057 --> 00:24:41,430
I thought tornadoes
were FEMA territory.

374
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,998
They are until they
destroy a public utility.

375
00:24:44,028 --> 00:24:46,231
Then that's when they call us.

376
00:24:47,399 --> 00:24:50,004
Sheriff, I'm sorry for
the misunderstanding

377
00:24:50,034 --> 00:24:52,741
but we've had massive
structural damage

378
00:24:52,771 --> 00:24:54,209
and I'd appreciate
it if you'd please

379
00:24:54,239 --> 00:24:57,912
keep your people back at least
100 meters from the site.

380
00:24:57,942 --> 00:24:59,344
For their safety, of course.

381
00:25:00,745 --> 00:25:02,251
Sounds reasonable.

382
00:25:02,281 --> 00:25:03,885
Gentlemen, let's
get back to work.

383
00:25:03,915 --> 00:25:05,820
You are not gonna
let him do this.

384
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:07,088
Come on, come on.

385
00:25:07,118 --> 00:25:09,358
That guy was lying
through his teeth.

386
00:25:09,388 --> 00:25:11,059
Look, he made a good case

387
00:25:11,089 --> 00:25:12,193
but now I wanna know
what you were doing here

388
00:25:12,223 --> 00:25:13,428
in the first place.

389
00:25:13,458 --> 00:25:16,164
Gail is a tornado
expert from the city.

390
00:25:16,194 --> 00:25:18,633
I told her what was
going on down here

391
00:25:18,663 --> 00:25:20,532
and she came to see for herself.

392
00:25:21,466 --> 00:25:22,737
Really?

393
00:25:22,767 --> 00:25:24,005
Yes.

394
00:25:24,035 --> 00:25:24,954
You've had a lot of
very strange weather

395
00:25:24,969 --> 00:25:26,675
happening lately, sheriff,

396
00:25:26,705 --> 00:25:27,909
and I don't know if you noticed

397
00:25:27,939 --> 00:25:29,608
but it hasn't been
making the news.

398
00:25:30,575 --> 00:25:31,713
I have noticed.

399
00:25:31,743 --> 00:25:33,582
Well I
think that these guys

400
00:25:33,612 --> 00:25:35,514
are probably
responsible for that.

401
00:25:37,416 --> 00:25:38,302
Come on, let's go, everybody.

402
00:25:38,317 --> 00:25:39,102
Back to your cars.

403
00:25:39,117 --> 00:25:39,936
Let's go.

404
00:25:39,951 --> 00:25:40,951
Let's get out of here.

405
00:25:42,053 --> 00:25:43,455
Everybody's got a job to do.

406
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:51,700
No, these goons
compromised our civil rights.

407
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:53,101
I mean it was ridiculous.

408
00:25:53,131 --> 00:25:54,336
They were...

409
00:25:54,366 --> 00:25:56,668
Ms. Curtis, this
is not Chicago.

410
00:25:57,802 --> 00:26:00,241
Things are different
around here, understand?

411
00:26:00,271 --> 00:26:01,576
I'm just
trying to figure out

412
00:26:01,606 --> 00:26:03,044
what's going on
with these storms,

413
00:26:03,074 --> 00:26:05,179
the storms that nobody
seems to be talking about.

414
00:26:05,209 --> 00:26:06,448
Well that makes two of us.

415
00:26:06,478 --> 00:26:09,351
Hey Norm, we gotta talk.

416
00:26:09,381 --> 00:26:11,353
Something really weird
is going on around here.

417
00:26:11,383 --> 00:26:12,384
You're telling me.

418
00:26:13,385 --> 00:26:15,156
Gail Curtis, Judd Walker.

419
00:26:15,186 --> 00:26:17,191
This is the farmer I
was telling you about.

420
00:26:17,221 --> 00:26:20,028
Ms. Curtis is a meteorologist
from my old neighborhood.

421
00:26:20,058 --> 00:26:23,562
Actually, former storm
chaser turned climate blogger.

422
00:26:24,629 --> 00:26:25,767
Climate blogger?

423
00:26:25,797 --> 00:26:27,369
Yeah, I write for a website.

424
00:26:27,399 --> 00:26:28,600
I know what a blog is.

425
00:26:31,002 --> 00:26:34,008
Me and Kelly got run off
the road by a black SUV.

426
00:26:34,038 --> 00:26:35,243
Looked like it had
government people in it,

427
00:26:35,273 --> 00:26:36,711
something like that.

428
00:26:36,741 --> 00:26:37,694
They were chasing another
one of those twisters.

429
00:26:37,709 --> 00:26:38,713
I know.

430
00:26:38,743 --> 00:26:40,649
I had a run in with 'em myself.

431
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:42,614
And I forgot to tell
you about my cows.

432
00:26:43,582 --> 00:26:44,719
Your cows?

433
00:26:44,749 --> 00:26:46,154
Yeah, cows, they
always face north south.

434
00:26:46,184 --> 00:26:47,356
They got a compass
in their brain

435
00:26:47,386 --> 00:26:48,338
and before that
storm, they were all

436
00:26:48,353 --> 00:26:49,524
walking around in circles

437
00:26:49,554 --> 00:26:51,493
like their compasses
were going all haywire.

438
00:26:51,523 --> 00:26:54,128
I'm telling you, Norm, something
very strange is going on.

439
00:26:54,158 --> 00:26:55,764
Wait, there's no
scientific evidence

440
00:26:55,794 --> 00:26:58,467
that undulates are sensitive
to electromagnetism.

441
00:26:58,497 --> 00:26:59,934
Undu-what?

442
00:26:59,964 --> 00:27:00,969
Cattle.

443
00:27:00,999 --> 00:27:02,537
Oh.

444
00:27:02,567 --> 00:27:04,473
No offense, lady, but
all those fancy words,

445
00:27:04,503 --> 00:27:05,489
they don't mean anything to me.

446
00:27:05,504 --> 00:27:07,041
I have farmer's intuition.

447
00:27:07,071 --> 00:27:08,543
Oh, of course, right.

448
00:27:08,573 --> 00:27:09,844
Who needs science?

449
00:27:09,874 --> 00:27:11,913
Cutting open pigs and
checking their entrails

450
00:27:11,943 --> 00:27:14,015
was just fine for
our ancestors, right?

451
00:27:14,045 --> 00:27:15,316
Look, look, why
don't the two of y'all

452
00:27:15,346 --> 00:27:17,051
just take it down a notch, okay?

453
00:27:17,081 --> 00:27:18,186
I wanna know what's
going on around here

454
00:27:18,216 --> 00:27:19,754
as much as you do

455
00:27:19,784 --> 00:27:21,690
but Judd, why don't
you take Ms. Curtis

456
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,325
back over to the
farm, show her around,

457
00:27:24,355 --> 00:27:26,895
and the two of you guys
come up with some answers?

458
00:27:26,925 --> 00:27:28,930
I don't think so,
I'm no babysitter.

459
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,665
Excuse me, what's
that supposed to mean?

460
00:27:30,695 --> 00:27:32,033
Look, I would do
it myself but man,

461
00:27:32,063 --> 00:27:34,132
you can see I am
swamped with paper work.

462
00:27:35,634 --> 00:27:36,586
Okay.

463
00:27:36,601 --> 00:27:37,806
My truck's outside.

464
00:27:37,836 --> 00:27:39,641
It's not a limousine so
you have to rough it.

465
00:27:39,671 --> 00:27:42,577
Oh, that's okay, cowboy,
but I know how to drive.

466
00:27:42,607 --> 00:27:44,913
My daddy let me get my
license when I was 16.

467
00:27:44,943 --> 00:27:46,915
He's very progressive that way.

468
00:27:46,945 --> 00:27:50,582
Sorry Judd, but a little
respect might be nice.

469
00:27:53,618 --> 00:27:54,618
You owe me.

470
00:27:55,654 --> 00:27:56,654
Big time.

471
00:28:01,693 --> 00:28:06,698
* Don't let me go

472
00:28:08,199 --> 00:28:09,771
* Let me flee

473
00:28:09,801 --> 00:28:14,576
* Don't let me know, let
me know, let me know *

474
00:28:14,606 --> 00:28:16,908
* That you hate me

475
00:28:58,683 --> 00:28:59,503
Dad!

476
00:28:59,518 --> 00:29:00,689
Yeah.

477
00:29:00,719 --> 00:29:02,056
You've gotta hear this.

478
00:29:02,086 --> 00:29:04,125
Oh my god!

479
00:29:04,155 --> 00:29:05,393
What?

480
00:29:05,423 --> 00:29:06,658
Gail Curtis?

481
00:29:08,793 --> 00:29:10,264
You know her?

482
00:29:10,294 --> 00:29:13,434
I had to do a report on
tornadoes for science class.

483
00:29:13,464 --> 00:29:18,469
Her blog is like the
hangout for storm chasers.

484
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,070
Hi, I'm Kelly.

485
00:29:21,072 --> 00:29:24,212
I heard your farm got hit
and I think whatever did it

486
00:29:24,242 --> 00:29:25,644
is something new.

487
00:29:26,811 --> 00:29:29,050
Something that we've
never seen before.

488
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,653
He told you about our
livestock didn't he?

489
00:29:31,683 --> 00:29:34,255
Well, I have something better.

490
00:29:34,285 --> 00:29:35,285
Come on.

491
00:29:39,958 --> 00:29:40,958
Come on.

492
00:29:56,307 --> 00:29:57,307
Wow.

493
00:30:00,545 --> 00:30:01,550
What do you think?

494
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,818
I think I wanna hear it again.

495
00:30:03,848 --> 00:30:05,687
Well I checked out your site

496
00:30:05,717 --> 00:30:07,388
and there was a twister
that was reported

497
00:30:07,418 --> 00:30:09,290
about three miles from here

498
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:12,256
at the exact same
time I recorded this.

499
00:30:13,157 --> 00:30:14,626
Maybe it means something.

500
00:30:16,227 --> 00:30:17,398
Maybe it does.

501
00:30:17,428 --> 00:30:19,100
Can you make me a copy?

502
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:20,331
Way ahead of you.

503
00:30:24,002 --> 00:30:25,503
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

504
00:30:26,537 --> 00:30:28,476
What are you gonna do with this?

505
00:30:28,506 --> 00:30:29,611
Have it analyzed.

506
00:30:29,641 --> 00:30:30,560
By who?

507
00:30:30,575 --> 00:30:31,713
I have a friend in the city.

508
00:30:31,743 --> 00:30:33,247
He's a freelance code monkey.

509
00:30:33,277 --> 00:30:35,049
He's big into cryptography.

510
00:30:35,079 --> 00:30:37,318
No offense but we
don't know you from Adam.

511
00:30:37,348 --> 00:30:39,053
Yes we do.

512
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:40,218
No we don't.

513
00:30:41,385 --> 00:30:42,624
If we're gonna give
this to anybody,

514
00:30:42,654 --> 00:30:44,158
we're gonna give
it to Norm Mackey.

515
00:30:44,188 --> 00:30:46,294
He'll hand it over to
the proper authorities.

516
00:30:46,324 --> 00:30:47,596
Oh, you mean like those thugs

517
00:30:47,626 --> 00:30:49,598
that nearly ran
you off the road.

518
00:30:49,628 --> 00:30:50,965
Listen to her, Judd.

519
00:30:50,995 --> 00:30:52,200
She knows her stuff.

520
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:53,149
Denise, if I
want your opinion,

521
00:30:53,164 --> 00:30:54,298
I'll ask for it.

522
00:30:56,267 --> 00:30:57,267
You're just so...

523
00:30:59,704 --> 00:31:02,176
Okay Denise, I think
we'd better leave.

524
00:31:02,206 --> 00:31:03,277
Good idea.

525
00:31:03,307 --> 00:31:04,679
I hope you're happy.

526
00:31:04,709 --> 00:31:06,244
Interfering with science.

527
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,185
Listen, when you
change your mind,

528
00:31:11,215 --> 00:31:12,316
here's my information.

529
00:31:13,451 --> 00:31:14,786
I'm at the Stay N' Save.

530
00:31:38,609 --> 00:31:40,749
Did you hear
what he said to me?

531
00:31:40,779 --> 00:31:41,913
The rudeness.

532
00:31:44,082 --> 00:31:47,355
His wife would've slapped
him upside the head.

533
00:31:47,385 --> 00:31:48,589
He's married?

534
00:31:48,619 --> 00:31:49,438
Was.

535
00:31:49,453 --> 00:31:51,159
She's dead now.

536
00:31:51,189 --> 00:31:52,994
I suppose I shouldn't blame him.

537
00:31:53,024 --> 00:31:56,060
Lord knows losing Harry
did a number on me.

538
00:32:00,999 --> 00:32:03,337
It's more of those men
from the power station.

539
00:32:03,367 --> 00:32:05,106
Now where are they
off to in such a hurry?

540
00:32:05,136 --> 00:32:06,875
Are we following them?

541
00:32:06,905 --> 00:32:08,276
Looks like it.

542
00:32:08,306 --> 00:32:09,225
Another car chase.

543
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,742
This is getting exciting.

544
00:32:15,313 --> 00:32:16,313
I'm sorry, honey.

545
00:32:17,615 --> 00:32:18,987
I just don't think
it's a good idea

546
00:32:19,017 --> 00:32:20,588
for us to trust everybody,

547
00:32:20,618 --> 00:32:24,158
especially some
celeb-utant from the city.

548
00:32:24,188 --> 00:32:25,326
For all we know, she might be

549
00:32:25,356 --> 00:32:27,528
working with the
feds from last night.

550
00:32:27,558 --> 00:32:29,731
That's your problem, dad.

551
00:32:29,761 --> 00:32:32,400
You don't trust
anybody or anything.

552
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:33,430
That's not true.

553
00:32:34,232 --> 00:32:35,266
I trust my instincts.

554
00:32:36,534 --> 00:32:37,806
Trust the ground under my feet.

555
00:32:37,836 --> 00:32:40,775
I trust hard work.

556
00:32:40,805 --> 00:32:42,343
I trust you.

557
00:32:42,373 --> 00:32:43,373
Really?

558
00:32:44,642 --> 00:32:47,345
You didn't trust me enough
to tell me that we're broke.

559
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,381
Honey, don't be like that.

560
00:32:52,616 --> 00:32:53,616
Just walk away.

561
00:32:59,623 --> 00:33:01,095
Come on, car.

562
00:33:01,125 --> 00:33:03,064
When are they gonna make
a hybrid with some power?

563
00:33:03,094 --> 00:33:05,096
I hear that.

564
00:33:08,532 --> 00:33:10,634
They're turning up ahead.

565
00:33:33,391 --> 00:33:34,391
Oh my lord!

566
00:33:43,067 --> 00:33:44,372
What's the matter?

567
00:33:44,402 --> 00:33:45,807
Some kind of interference.

568
00:33:45,837 --> 00:33:49,878
Like a
really strong magnet?

569
00:33:49,908 --> 00:33:51,409
Not just cattle.

570
00:33:52,643 --> 00:33:54,115
It's coming this way.

571
00:33:54,145 --> 00:33:55,145
I see it.

572
00:34:05,456 --> 00:34:06,456
Go!

573
00:34:07,625 --> 00:34:08,625
Denise!

574
00:34:09,994 --> 00:34:10,994
Denise, no!

575
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:33,250
Hey.

576
00:34:34,052 --> 00:34:35,052
What is it?

577
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:06,950
Who is it?

578
00:35:07,919 --> 00:35:08,987
Judd Walker.

579
00:35:17,962 --> 00:35:20,935
What do
you want, cowboy?

580
00:35:20,965 --> 00:35:21,885
I was a little
rough on you earlier.

581
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,001
I wanna apologize.

582
00:35:26,537 --> 00:35:28,406
Think your friend still
wants to see this?

583
00:35:35,213 --> 00:35:36,032
I'm on it.

584
00:35:36,047 --> 00:35:37,047
Heading there now.

585
00:35:45,489 --> 00:35:46,489
Dead?

586
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,960
Yeah.

587
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:54,232
I've known
Denise most of my life.

588
00:35:55,399 --> 00:35:58,769
I barely knew her at
all and I'm a wreck.

589
00:36:06,777 --> 00:36:07,777
You okay?

590
00:36:09,113 --> 00:36:10,113
Yeah.

591
00:36:13,684 --> 00:36:14,785
She predicted this.

592
00:36:17,488 --> 00:36:18,374
Really?

593
00:36:18,389 --> 00:36:19,527
Yeah.

594
00:36:19,557 --> 00:36:21,963
Her husband, Harry,
he was killed

595
00:36:21,993 --> 00:36:23,694
by a tornado about
three years ago

596
00:36:25,396 --> 00:36:26,467
and, well I'm not quite
sure what happened.

597
00:36:26,497 --> 00:36:28,132
She got a warning on a website

598
00:36:29,633 --> 00:36:31,405
and got into the cellar
on time and he didn't

599
00:36:31,435 --> 00:36:35,977
and all these years she's
been telling everybody

600
00:36:36,007 --> 00:36:38,709
that one day they were gonna
be reunited by a twister.

601
00:36:47,118 --> 00:36:48,552
I saw something on the
farm that kinda scared me.

602
00:36:50,421 --> 00:36:52,123
What would scare
a guy like you?

603
00:36:54,225 --> 00:36:55,429
Well.

604
00:36:55,459 --> 00:36:56,730
I took pictures, it's
on the flash drive.

605
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,760
Here?

606
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,406
Oh my god, that's horrible.

607
00:37:05,436 --> 00:37:06,704
What are all those pins?

608
00:37:08,472 --> 00:37:09,944
Confirmed tornado sightings

609
00:37:09,974 --> 00:37:11,742
from the last 48 hours.

610
00:37:13,311 --> 00:37:14,815
You think
there's a pattern?

611
00:37:14,845 --> 00:37:17,085
If there is, I
haven't found it yet.

612
00:37:17,115 --> 00:37:18,516
Gail Curtis?

613
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:21,289
Hey Barney, listen.

614
00:37:21,319 --> 00:37:23,087
I just sent you an audio file.

615
00:37:24,288 --> 00:37:25,893
Could you help me out
and analyze it for me?

616
00:37:25,923 --> 00:37:27,225
Do it as fast as you can.

617
00:37:28,126 --> 00:37:29,493
Well I'm glad to see you too.

618
00:37:41,905 --> 00:37:43,978
Alright, I got it.

619
00:37:44,008 --> 00:37:47,348
Now exactly what am I
supposed to be looking for?

620
00:37:47,378 --> 00:37:48,916
Anything and everything.

621
00:37:48,946 --> 00:37:51,449
I think it's some sort
of signal or code.

622
00:37:52,616 --> 00:37:54,822
So we're on to something big.

623
00:37:54,852 --> 00:37:56,057
Alright.

624
00:37:56,087 --> 00:37:58,126
I'll throw the phone book at it.

625
00:37:58,156 --> 00:37:59,360
Give me a couple of hours.

626
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:00,376
I'll see what I
can come up with.

627
00:38:00,391 --> 00:38:01,525
Thanks Barney,
you're the best.

628
00:38:30,588 --> 00:38:32,993
Looks like all these
are near government land

629
00:38:33,023 --> 00:38:34,325
or public utilities.

630
00:38:35,926 --> 00:38:37,231
This one here that
wiped out my farm,

631
00:38:37,261 --> 00:38:39,100
it's right down from a
NORAD tracking station

632
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:42,336
and this one, there's
a big power plant there

633
00:38:42,366 --> 00:38:46,340
and this one right here,
that's an air force base.

634
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:49,210
And Denise was killed
near a reservoir.

635
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,545
Somebody's testing our
strengths and our weaknesses,

636
00:38:51,575 --> 00:38:53,711
figuring out the best
way to bring us down.

637
00:38:55,146 --> 00:38:57,085
What does that livestock
have to do with that theory?

638
00:38:57,115 --> 00:38:59,117
Maybe they're testing
our biology too.

639
00:39:00,084 --> 00:39:01,084
Come on.

640
00:39:01,785 --> 00:39:03,023
This is too much.

641
00:39:03,053 --> 00:39:04,492
I mean I can buy the
idea that maybe this

642
00:39:04,522 --> 00:39:06,260
is some sort of secret
government weather weapon

643
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:08,329
that got out of control
or maybe the Chinese

644
00:39:08,359 --> 00:39:09,997
or somebody like that are
sending these things over

645
00:39:10,027 --> 00:39:12,133
to mess with us but
tornadoes trying

646
00:39:12,163 --> 00:39:14,102
to figure out our biology, no.

647
00:39:14,132 --> 00:39:15,936
I know it sounds crazy.

648
00:39:15,966 --> 00:39:17,438
It sure does and I
don't like the idea

649
00:39:17,468 --> 00:39:19,903
that we might be the only
two lunatics in the asylum.

650
00:39:29,046 --> 00:39:30,151
Mackey.

651
00:39:30,181 --> 00:39:31,185
Listen Norm,
something very strange

652
00:39:31,215 --> 00:39:32,420
is going on with
these tornadoes.

653
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:33,487
You gotta get somebody
to call the governor

654
00:39:33,517 --> 00:39:34,988
or somebody like that.

655
00:39:35,018 --> 00:39:36,157
I'm in West Bend.

656
00:39:36,187 --> 00:39:37,721
Tornado took out half the town.

657
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:41,359
Norm.

658
00:39:42,193 --> 00:39:43,364
Norm!

659
00:39:43,394 --> 00:39:45,466
Twister just took out West Bend.

660
00:39:45,496 --> 00:39:46,496
Let's go.

661
00:41:00,504 --> 00:41:01,805
Well his car is here.

662
00:41:03,807 --> 00:41:05,443
Yeah but
he's not in it.

663
00:41:13,183 --> 00:41:14,183
Norm!

664
00:41:15,686 --> 00:41:16,887
Sheriff Mackey!

665
00:41:19,257 --> 00:41:20,257
Norm!

666
00:41:21,259 --> 00:41:23,160
I'm over here!

667
00:41:24,127 --> 00:41:25,566
Judd!

668
00:41:25,596 --> 00:41:26,834
Help!

669
00:41:26,864 --> 00:41:28,068
Alright,
we're here, buddy!

670
00:41:28,098 --> 00:41:30,604
My foot's stuck
under this damn tree!

671
00:41:30,634 --> 00:41:31,454
You okay?

672
00:41:31,469 --> 00:41:32,388
I'm just stuck.

673
00:41:32,403 --> 00:41:33,322
Anything broken?

674
00:41:33,337 --> 00:41:35,739
Nah, I'm alright.

675
00:41:37,241 --> 00:41:38,742
What happened, buddy?

676
00:41:41,912 --> 00:41:42,912
Those tornadoes.

677
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:45,401
They're attacking.

678
00:41:45,416 --> 00:41:46,954
They're looking for a fight.

679
00:41:46,984 --> 00:41:48,489
What are you doing out here?

680
00:41:48,519 --> 00:41:51,859
I got a report those MIBs
were scoping out the place

681
00:41:51,889 --> 00:41:54,224
so I thought I'd just
come out and take a look.

682
00:41:56,093 --> 00:41:57,461
When did the two of
you bury the hatchet?

683
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,904
Hey Barney, that's fast.

684
00:42:03,934 --> 00:42:05,168
Gail, what's going on?

685
00:42:06,069 --> 00:42:07,441
Are you messing with me, girl?

686
00:42:07,471 --> 00:42:08,391
What do you mean?

687
00:42:08,406 --> 00:42:09,610
I just ran your file

688
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,811
through some pattern
matching software

689
00:42:10,841 --> 00:42:11,845
and I got a huge hit.

690
00:42:11,875 --> 00:42:13,080
Great, so what is it?

691
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:14,948
NASA, air force, what?

692
00:42:14,978 --> 00:42:17,184
It's not one of
ours, that's for sure.

693
00:42:17,214 --> 00:42:18,852
Oh, so it's foreign.

694
00:42:18,882 --> 00:42:20,588
You could say that.

695
00:42:20,618 --> 00:42:21,437
So who is it?

696
00:42:21,452 --> 00:42:23,223
China, North Korea, who?

697
00:42:23,253 --> 00:42:24,922
Try Alpha Centauri.

698
00:42:25,889 --> 00:42:26,875
Come on, Barney.

699
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:28,128
I need you to be
serious, please.

700
00:42:28,158 --> 00:42:29,797
I'm dead serious.

701
00:42:29,827 --> 00:42:31,131
Have you ever heard
of the Wow signal?

702
00:42:31,161 --> 00:42:33,834
Yeah, 1977.

703
00:42:33,864 --> 00:42:35,336
Some guys from CETI
thought that they

704
00:42:35,366 --> 00:42:37,805
intercepted some
alien transmission

705
00:42:37,835 --> 00:42:39,807
but it never repeated, right?

706
00:42:39,837 --> 00:42:41,041
Bingo.

707
00:42:41,071 --> 00:42:43,273
That file you sent me,
it's an exact match.

708
00:42:44,742 --> 00:42:45,843
Mutilated cattle.

709
00:42:47,445 --> 00:42:48,479
Men in black.

710
00:42:50,881 --> 00:42:52,650
So what's next, flying saucers?

711
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,320
Speak of the devil.

712
00:43:12,202 --> 00:43:14,942
What did you do?

713
00:43:14,972 --> 00:43:15,972
What did we do?

714
00:43:17,107 --> 00:43:19,913
Two of my men are
dead, Ms. Curtis.

715
00:43:19,943 --> 00:43:21,879
You were there.

716
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:25,115
Sticking your nose
where it doesn't belong.

717
00:43:26,784 --> 00:43:27,784
Now this.

718
00:43:31,622 --> 00:43:34,027
They've never
interfered with us before.

719
00:43:34,057 --> 00:43:35,363
Who's they?

720
00:43:35,393 --> 00:43:37,565
The signal is
extraterrestrial, isn't it?

721
00:43:37,595 --> 00:43:40,067
Extraterrestrial,
are you talking about like ET?

722
00:43:40,097 --> 00:43:41,098
Who told you that?

723
00:43:42,299 --> 00:43:44,171
What does it matter
who the hell told him?

724
00:43:44,201 --> 00:43:45,406
Those things are
headed for Chicago.

725
00:43:45,436 --> 00:43:46,640
We'd better start
warning people.

726
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:48,742
You've got your
facts all wrong, Mr...

727
00:43:48,772 --> 00:43:50,043
Judd Walker.

728
00:43:50,073 --> 00:43:52,346
This is a
meteorological phenomenon

729
00:43:52,376 --> 00:43:53,777
and we're studying it.

730
00:43:58,549 --> 00:43:59,549
Armstrong.

731
00:44:00,884 --> 00:44:02,923
Yes, I'm on the scene now.

732
00:44:02,953 --> 00:44:05,559
The damage is total.

733
00:44:05,589 --> 00:44:07,991
I think we can confirm
hostile intent.

734
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:11,465
And we have one
more complication.

735
00:44:11,495 --> 00:44:14,398
The Curtis woman knows
about the Nimbus.

736
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:16,999
I don't know.

737
00:44:18,135 --> 00:44:20,438
Sir, they already
are suspicious.

738
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:24,712
I think that's gonna make
them all the more suspicious.

739
00:44:24,742 --> 00:44:25,742
Yes.

740
00:44:27,044 --> 00:44:28,044
Yes.

741
00:44:28,712 --> 00:44:29,712
I understand.

742
00:44:32,516 --> 00:44:33,335
Hey, what do
you think you're doing?

743
00:44:33,350 --> 00:44:34,955
This is my jurisdiction.

744
00:44:34,985 --> 00:44:36,924
Meteorological phenomena.

745
00:44:36,954 --> 00:44:38,592
That's why you're
having us arrested?

746
00:44:38,622 --> 00:44:39,827
I'm not arresting you.

747
00:44:39,857 --> 00:44:41,429
We're putting you in
protective custody

748
00:44:41,459 --> 00:44:43,864
to keep you from running
around the countryside

749
00:44:43,894 --> 00:44:45,395
getting yourselves killed.

750
00:44:46,396 --> 00:44:47,396
Norm, Norm!

751
00:44:50,568 --> 00:44:51,386
Listen, mister.

752
00:44:51,401 --> 00:44:52,936
No, you listen to me!

753
00:44:54,171 --> 00:44:56,777
This situation is way
above your pay grade.

754
00:44:56,807 --> 00:45:00,481
I make one phone call
and you are out of a job.

755
00:45:00,511 --> 00:45:01,645
Is that what you want?

756
00:45:02,946 --> 00:45:03,946
Hm?

757
00:45:04,682 --> 00:45:06,253
No.

758
00:45:06,283 --> 00:45:07,283
I didn't think so.

759
00:47:38,769 --> 00:47:41,675
It appears our cowboy
lives on a farm

760
00:47:41,705 --> 00:47:43,807
next door to the
tracking station

761
00:47:44,975 --> 00:47:46,409
where the alpha
incident occurred.

762
00:47:49,913 --> 00:47:52,449
He and the girl know
about the Nimbus

763
00:47:54,517 --> 00:47:57,621
so either there's been a
massive security breach

764
00:47:59,522 --> 00:48:01,859
or they've discovered
something we haven't seen.

765
00:48:04,928 --> 00:48:08,465
The committee wants
us to go take a look

766
00:48:11,068 --> 00:48:13,306
and that is what
we're going to do.

767
00:48:13,336 --> 00:48:15,242
Sheriff, you have
a lovely office.

768
00:48:15,272 --> 00:48:16,744
Thank you for the use of it.

769
00:48:16,774 --> 00:48:19,046
Look, I don't know who
the hell you think you are

770
00:48:19,076 --> 00:48:21,448
but I represent the
people of this county.

771
00:48:21,478 --> 00:48:24,715
And I represent the people
of these United States.

772
00:48:25,783 --> 00:48:28,351
Who's got the bigger job?

773
00:48:32,956 --> 00:48:33,956
Bigger job.

774
00:48:35,625 --> 00:48:36,625
Bigger jackass.

775
00:48:39,062 --> 00:48:40,267
Hang on.

776
00:48:40,297 --> 00:48:41,935
I ran the plates
on that black SUV.

777
00:48:41,965 --> 00:48:42,965
I got nothing.

778
00:48:43,633 --> 00:48:44,633
Thank you.

779
00:48:46,569 --> 00:48:48,375
What's going on, Norm?

780
00:48:48,405 --> 00:48:50,377
You two must really have
a bug up somebody's butt.

781
00:48:50,407 --> 00:48:51,679
Just get us out of here.

782
00:48:51,709 --> 00:48:53,280
I can't do that,
this is my job.

783
00:48:53,310 --> 00:48:54,347
This badge is all I got.

784
00:48:54,377 --> 00:48:55,582
People's lives are at stake

785
00:48:55,612 --> 00:48:57,284
and you're worried
about your damn job.

786
00:48:57,314 --> 00:48:59,352
Look, this Armstrong is
as serious as heart attack

787
00:48:59,382 --> 00:49:00,954
and the federal
government is behind this.

788
00:49:00,984 --> 00:49:03,223
What do you think you can
do that they can't do?

789
00:49:03,253 --> 00:49:04,172
Warn people, Norm.

790
00:49:04,187 --> 00:49:06,093
This thing is escalating, man.

791
00:49:06,123 --> 00:49:07,695
Do you understand this
is more than a couple

792
00:49:07,725 --> 00:49:09,329
of isolated twisters
we're talking about?

793
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:10,363
Just what are
you talking about?

794
00:49:10,393 --> 00:49:11,699
Mars, ETs?

795
00:49:11,729 --> 00:49:14,034
This is way beyond
my area of expertise.

796
00:49:14,064 --> 00:49:15,836
Now what do you think
that you two can do

797
00:49:15,866 --> 00:49:18,068
that the federal
government can't do better?

798
00:49:19,202 --> 00:49:20,540
Fine.

799
00:49:20,570 --> 00:49:22,042
If you're not gonna do anything,

800
00:49:22,072 --> 00:49:24,177
at least get a hold of
my daughter, will ya?

801
00:49:24,207 --> 00:49:25,208
I will call Kelly.

802
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,980
Kelly, this is Norm.

803
00:50:00,010 --> 00:50:03,016
As soon as you get
this message, call me.

804
00:50:03,046 --> 00:50:04,032
It's about your dad.

805
00:50:04,047 --> 00:50:05,047
It's an emergency.

806
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:07,951
She's in danger.

807
00:50:09,186 --> 00:50:10,186
We all are.

808
00:50:12,555 --> 00:50:14,027
You gotta find her, Norm.

809
00:50:14,057 --> 00:50:15,057
Please.

810
00:50:16,659 --> 00:50:17,659
I'll find her.

811
00:51:02,973 --> 00:51:04,477
Man, what the hell do
you think you're doing?

812
00:51:04,507 --> 00:51:06,313
Sheriff, don't make
me tell you again,

813
00:51:06,343 --> 00:51:07,915
stay out of our way.

814
00:51:07,945 --> 00:51:08,945
Where's Kelly?

815
00:51:11,181 --> 00:51:12,181
She's gone.

816
00:51:14,684 --> 00:51:18,291
It looks like there's
trouble in the heartland.

817
00:51:18,321 --> 00:51:20,590
Chicago, these things
are going to Chicago.

818
00:51:21,758 --> 00:51:24,431
Sir, I think you
should see this.

819
00:51:24,461 --> 00:51:25,966
I pulled up her
recent activity log

820
00:51:25,996 --> 00:51:27,931
and this is what
popped up on her blog.

821
00:51:29,732 --> 00:51:33,273
This is Kelly Walker and I'm
recording this for posterity.

822
00:51:33,303 --> 00:51:36,509
A couple hours ago, I
intercepted what I think

823
00:51:36,539 --> 00:51:38,808
might be an extraterrestrial
radio signal.

824
00:51:39,742 --> 00:51:40,878
Here, check it out.

825
00:51:44,281 --> 00:51:46,053
Pretty cool, huh?

826
00:51:46,083 --> 00:51:47,654
Well I think it
might have something

827
00:51:47,684 --> 00:51:49,756
to do with the tornadoes
we've been having.

828
00:51:49,786 --> 00:51:52,292
If I can prove
that actual aliens

829
00:51:52,322 --> 00:51:54,361
are messing with our atmosphere,

830
00:51:54,391 --> 00:51:57,364
I'll be up there with
Einstein, Newton,

831
00:51:57,394 --> 00:51:59,029
Galileo, even.

832
00:52:00,130 --> 00:52:01,434
If that's not
scholarship material,

833
00:52:01,464 --> 00:52:03,333
well, I don't know what is.

834
00:52:04,434 --> 00:52:07,474
Parnell, Cox, find her.

835
00:52:07,504 --> 00:52:08,608
And?

836
00:52:08,638 --> 00:52:10,908
For now just find her.

837
00:52:12,775 --> 00:52:15,282
That's what you're gonna
do, arrest a 17 year old girl?

838
00:52:15,312 --> 00:52:16,416
Don't worry, sheriff.

839
00:52:16,446 --> 00:52:17,885
She'll be safer with my men

840
00:52:17,915 --> 00:52:19,752
than she will be on her own.

841
00:52:19,782 --> 00:52:21,488
What's your big plan?

842
00:52:21,518 --> 00:52:22,722
We have contingencies.

843
00:52:22,752 --> 00:52:23,752
Contingencies.

844
00:52:24,821 --> 00:52:27,527
There's a chain
of command, sheriff.

845
00:52:27,557 --> 00:52:28,828
I follow it.

846
00:52:28,858 --> 00:52:31,498
I suggest you follow it too.

847
00:52:31,528 --> 00:52:33,830
Just be grateful we
let you tag along.

848
00:52:34,697 --> 00:52:35,697
Excuse me.

849
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:38,300
There is no plans.

850
00:52:39,402 --> 00:52:41,008
You're just making this
stuff up as you go along

851
00:52:41,038 --> 00:52:43,543
and hoping this whole
thing will blow over.

852
00:52:43,573 --> 00:52:44,573
Blow over.

853
00:52:47,444 --> 00:52:48,645
Oh, that's clever.

854
00:52:49,779 --> 00:52:52,315
Be careful, sheriff,
because clever

855
00:52:53,984 --> 00:52:56,954
isn't always smart.

856
00:53:11,868 --> 00:53:12,868
Chicago?

857
00:53:13,937 --> 00:53:15,142
Are you sure?

858
00:53:15,172 --> 00:53:16,091
Look, I found
it out at the farm

859
00:53:16,106 --> 00:53:17,577
with some of Armstrong's guys.

860
00:53:17,607 --> 00:53:19,746
They found a video that
she posted on the web.

861
00:53:19,776 --> 00:53:22,815
She knows about the ETs
and she can prove it.

862
00:53:22,845 --> 00:53:24,217
He sent some of his
men out to get her.

863
00:53:24,247 --> 00:53:25,682
You gotta let us out, Norm.

864
00:53:27,484 --> 00:53:29,456
Judd, there's something
I gotta tell you.

865
00:53:29,486 --> 00:53:30,958
What?

866
00:53:30,988 --> 00:53:33,123
You said that I couldn't
hack it in the big city.

867
00:53:34,624 --> 00:53:36,496
You's telling the truth.

868
00:53:36,526 --> 00:53:38,698
What are you talking about?

869
00:53:38,728 --> 00:53:40,367
We were supposed to
go pick up a suspect.

870
00:53:40,397 --> 00:53:43,971
I was coming in the
back of the building.

871
00:53:44,001 --> 00:53:45,001
I didn't see a gun.

872
00:53:46,236 --> 00:53:47,236
I froze.

873
00:53:49,072 --> 00:53:50,072
I let him go.

874
00:53:51,975 --> 00:53:56,913
After that, everybody said
that I couldn't be trusted.

875
00:53:58,181 --> 00:53:59,382
So you ran away.

876
00:54:00,817 --> 00:54:02,855
Look, following Armstrong
isn't the first dumb decision

877
00:54:02,885 --> 00:54:04,457
I've ever made.

878
00:54:04,487 --> 00:54:06,889
Well now you have a
chance to make a right one.

879
00:54:08,091 --> 00:54:09,091
Let us out.

880
00:54:27,444 --> 00:54:28,445
Kelly Walker?

881
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:32,252
Never heard of her.

882
00:54:32,282 --> 00:54:33,135
I'm Agent Cox.

883
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:34,287
This is Agent Parnell.

884
00:54:34,317 --> 00:54:35,318
Your father sent us.

885
00:54:36,786 --> 00:54:38,125
Where is he?

886
00:54:38,155 --> 00:54:39,392
Chicago.

887
00:54:39,422 --> 00:54:41,094
What is he doing in Chicago?

888
00:54:41,124 --> 00:54:43,330
He's helping us with
our investigation.

889
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:44,364
Here, get in.

890
00:54:44,394 --> 00:54:45,495
We'll take you to him.

891
00:54:46,796 --> 00:54:48,635
Or you could walk.

892
00:54:48,665 --> 00:54:49,665
It's your choice.

893
00:55:00,477 --> 00:55:03,283
Guys, do we
have to lock the doors?

894
00:55:03,313 --> 00:55:04,814
Never trust a stranger, kid.

895
00:55:06,483 --> 00:55:07,587
You're out now,
what do you do?

896
00:55:07,617 --> 00:55:08,536
Alert the media.

897
00:55:08,551 --> 00:55:09,756
We contact radio stations,

898
00:55:09,786 --> 00:55:11,024
TV stations, whoever
will listen to us.

899
00:55:11,054 --> 00:55:12,392
I'm with you there but
my daughter comes first.

900
00:55:12,422 --> 00:55:13,341
Okay, I've got an idea.

901
00:55:13,356 --> 00:55:14,761
I'll contact the radio stations

902
00:55:14,791 --> 00:55:16,263
because they're more
likely to listen to a cop.

903
00:55:16,293 --> 00:55:18,265
Hey look, take the
keys to the cruiser.

904
00:55:18,295 --> 00:55:20,900
Anything happen to my car
comes out of my salary.

905
00:55:20,930 --> 00:55:22,135
Here's the keys to my truck.

906
00:55:22,165 --> 00:55:23,170
It's still out in
connector three.

907
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,337
Alright, take my cellphone.

908
00:55:24,367 --> 00:55:25,320
If I hear anything,
I'll call you.

909
00:55:25,335 --> 00:55:26,335
Great, thank you.

910
00:55:33,776 --> 00:55:34,596
Operator.

911
00:55:34,611 --> 00:55:36,083
Emergency.

912
00:55:36,113 --> 00:55:37,584
This is Sheriff Mackey.

913
00:55:37,614 --> 00:55:38,885
I need the phone numbers for
every major radio station

914
00:55:38,915 --> 00:55:39,915
in Chicago.

915
00:55:45,255 --> 00:55:47,394
I'm sure our listeners
will have a lot

916
00:55:47,424 --> 00:55:50,460
to say about this issue
so let's take some calls.

917
00:55:51,661 --> 00:55:54,567
Alright, I see we have
a Sheriff Norm Mackey

918
00:55:54,597 --> 00:55:56,303
from Lando County on line three.

919
00:55:56,333 --> 00:55:58,438
Hello sheriff,
you're on the air.

920
00:55:58,468 --> 00:55:59,872
Hello, this is Sheriff Mackey.

921
00:55:59,902 --> 00:56:01,508
I am calling about the
tornadoes that we're having

922
00:56:01,538 --> 00:56:03,543
that the news services
saying that we're not having.

923
00:56:03,573 --> 00:56:07,013
Yeah, actually, our topic
today is the deficit, sheriff,

924
00:56:07,043 --> 00:56:11,084
but we all wish to
weather the coming storm,

925
00:56:11,114 --> 00:56:12,919
financially speaking,
as best we can.

926
00:56:12,949 --> 00:56:14,654
Let's try to stay
on point, shall we?

927
00:56:14,684 --> 00:56:16,089
But these things are aliens

928
00:56:16,119 --> 00:56:17,524
and that's why they're
denying everything.

929
00:56:17,554 --> 00:56:20,059
This is area 51 all over again.

930
00:56:20,089 --> 00:56:21,261
I see.

931
00:56:21,291 --> 00:56:22,495
Look,
this is not a joke.

932
00:56:22,525 --> 00:56:23,730
I don't know what they want,

933
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:24,579
I don't know where they're from

934
00:56:24,594 --> 00:56:25,832
but this is not...

935
00:56:25,862 --> 00:56:28,501
Gary, supposed to be
screening these calls.

936
00:56:28,531 --> 00:56:30,600
They will lock
up anybody that mentions...

937
00:56:34,337 --> 00:56:36,709
If you can't do your job,
I'll find somebody who can.

938
00:56:36,739 --> 00:56:37,744
Hello?

939
00:56:37,774 --> 00:56:38,774
Hello?

940
00:57:12,175 --> 00:57:13,175
There's the bus.

941
00:57:20,550 --> 00:57:21,550
Kelly?

942
00:57:39,469 --> 00:57:42,575
Hey Judd, maybe
she wasn't even on this bus.

943
00:57:42,605 --> 00:57:43,673
Yes she was.

944
00:57:45,107 --> 00:57:47,113
Okay, don't jump
to any conclusions.

945
00:57:47,143 --> 00:57:48,062
There were no bodies.

946
00:57:48,077 --> 00:57:50,247
Maybe everybody got out safely.

947
00:57:52,715 --> 00:57:53,953
Norm.

948
00:57:53,983 --> 00:57:55,054
It didn't work.

949
00:57:55,084 --> 00:57:56,289
Who did you call?

950
00:57:56,319 --> 00:57:57,857
I called a radio station.

951
00:57:57,887 --> 00:57:59,726
As soon as they
put me on the air

952
00:57:59,756 --> 00:58:01,928
and I mentioned aliens,
it was open season

953
00:58:01,958 --> 00:58:03,930
on the crazy man.

954
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:05,798
Yeah, we need proof.

955
00:58:05,828 --> 00:58:06,748
Proof?

956
00:58:06,763 --> 00:58:08,501
How do I get proof that aliens

957
00:58:08,531 --> 00:58:10,603
sent twisters to
destroy Chicago?

958
00:58:10,633 --> 00:58:12,672
You have to try again.

959
00:58:12,702 --> 00:58:14,140
Go to Channel 37.

960
00:58:14,170 --> 00:58:16,609
It's the station I worked for
when I was a storm chaser.

961
00:58:16,639 --> 00:58:18,110
Use my name.

962
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:19,446
Tell them there's gonna be
a major tornado outbreak

963
00:58:19,476 --> 00:58:21,248
heading towards Chicago.

964
00:58:21,278 --> 00:58:22,449
I have to warn people.

965
00:58:22,479 --> 00:58:24,116
Tell people to get down
into their basements

966
00:58:24,146 --> 00:58:25,318
and stay there.

967
00:58:25,348 --> 00:58:26,167
Okay.

968
00:58:26,182 --> 00:58:27,984
Look, I will give it a...

969
00:58:28,818 --> 00:58:29,818
Norm?

970
00:58:31,321 --> 00:58:32,321
Norm!

971
00:58:36,826 --> 00:58:39,866
Mr. Walker, Ms.
Curtis, I presume.

972
00:58:39,896 --> 00:58:41,067
Armstrong?

973
00:58:41,097 --> 00:58:42,699
Tell Judd we
have his daughter.

974
00:58:43,566 --> 00:58:44,971
Where is she?

975
00:58:45,001 --> 00:58:46,706
We're taking her to
one of our safe houses

976
00:58:46,736 --> 00:58:50,176
in the city until you
two turn yourselves in.

977
00:58:50,206 --> 00:58:51,678
If we're right,
Armstrong, there aren't

978
00:58:51,708 --> 00:58:54,847
gonna be any safe houses in
Chicago or anywhere else.

979
00:58:54,877 --> 00:58:57,284
That's just the type
of hysterical paranoia

980
00:58:57,314 --> 00:58:59,449
we're trying to
prevent, Mr. Walker.

981
00:59:01,117 --> 00:59:03,022
Let's both be reasonable.

982
00:59:03,052 --> 00:59:04,991
Put our cards on the table.

983
00:59:05,021 --> 00:59:08,257
We know about the
livestock mutilations.

984
00:59:09,426 --> 00:59:10,793
You know about the Nimbus.

985
00:59:11,994 --> 00:59:15,167
We know about the signal
your daughter recorded.

986
00:59:15,197 --> 00:59:16,197
The Nimbus?

987
00:59:17,266 --> 00:59:18,538
Is that what you call 'em?

988
00:59:18,568 --> 00:59:19,568
It's a code name.

989
00:59:20,603 --> 00:59:21,808
What do they want?

990
00:59:21,838 --> 00:59:24,477
We don't communicate
with them directly.

991
00:59:24,507 --> 00:59:26,409
They're not exactly
on our wavelength.

992
00:59:27,477 --> 00:59:28,477
Look.

993
00:59:29,479 --> 00:59:30,617
The connections you've made

994
00:59:30,647 --> 00:59:32,815
are making my
bosses very nervous

995
00:59:34,484 --> 00:59:37,557
and I've been instructed to
prevent any further leakage.

996
00:59:37,587 --> 00:59:39,759
How long do you
think it's gonna take

997
00:59:39,789 --> 00:59:42,261
for someone else to make
the same connections?

998
00:59:42,291 --> 00:59:43,993
I don't deal in hypotheticals.

999
00:59:45,161 --> 00:59:47,263
All I can do is prevent a panic

1000
00:59:49,165 --> 00:59:52,004
but it seems like
everything you do

1001
00:59:52,034 --> 00:59:54,273
is trying to incite one.

1002
00:59:54,303 --> 00:59:56,943
Armstrong, I'm coming
to get my daughter.

1003
00:59:56,973 --> 00:59:59,376
If anything happens to her...

1004
01:00:11,954 --> 01:00:13,556
That's a problem.

1005
01:00:17,527 --> 01:00:19,161
The pattern's changed again.

1006
01:00:20,963 --> 01:00:21,963
Yes.

1007
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,835
I think we're looking at
the worst case scenario.

1008
01:00:28,905 --> 01:00:30,807
Yes, I'm on my way
to the airport now.

1009
01:00:33,876 --> 01:00:34,981
I'm hungry.

1010
01:00:35,011 --> 01:00:37,116
Can you pull over please?

1011
01:00:37,146 --> 01:00:38,718
Pull over here and
I'll run across the street

1012
01:00:38,748 --> 01:00:39,701
and grab her a taco.

1013
01:00:39,716 --> 01:00:40,568
I'm getting out too.

1014
01:00:40,583 --> 01:00:41,403
No way, kid.

1015
01:00:41,418 --> 01:00:42,455
I have to pee.

1016
01:00:42,485 --> 01:00:43,723
Not happening.

1017
01:00:43,753 --> 01:00:46,055
I told
you I have to pee.

1018
01:00:47,690 --> 01:00:49,195
Can't you wait?

1019
01:00:49,225 --> 01:00:51,728
This is a government
issued vehicle, right?

1020
01:00:52,929 --> 01:00:53,748
So?

1021
01:00:53,763 --> 01:00:55,768
So I watch TV.

1022
01:00:55,798 --> 01:00:57,837
You guys have to
sign for these things

1023
01:00:57,867 --> 01:01:01,307
which means you're
responsible for any damages

1024
01:01:01,337 --> 01:01:05,478
like urine stains on the
upholstery for example.

1025
01:01:05,508 --> 01:01:08,114
You try one thing,
okay, and I will...

1026
01:01:08,144 --> 01:01:09,211
You'll what?

1027
01:01:10,713 --> 01:01:12,485
You'll spank me?

1028
01:01:12,515 --> 01:01:14,183
In your dreams, loser.

1029
01:01:16,453 --> 01:01:17,453
Parnell.

1030
01:01:31,501 --> 01:01:32,639
Go right over here.

1031
01:01:32,669 --> 01:01:33,673
Help, help!

1032
01:01:33,703 --> 01:01:34,689
I'm being kidnapped!

1033
01:01:34,704 --> 01:01:35,523
Please!

1034
01:01:35,538 --> 01:01:36,709
Let go of me!

1035
01:01:36,739 --> 01:01:37,810
Back up, guys.

1036
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:39,476
Official federal business.

1037
01:01:42,011 --> 01:01:43,583
Back up, federal agent!

1038
01:01:43,613 --> 01:01:45,017
Federal agent!

1039
01:01:45,047 --> 01:01:46,215
Back up, federal agents!

1040
01:01:50,119 --> 01:01:51,621
She's that way, let's go.

1041
01:02:00,663 --> 01:02:02,334
Did you get through?

1042
01:02:02,364 --> 01:02:03,402
Dad?

1043
01:02:03,432 --> 01:02:04,637
Kelly.

1044
01:02:04,667 --> 01:02:05,972
I tried calling
but no one answered.

1045
01:02:06,002 --> 01:02:07,474
Why are you on Norm's phone?

1046
01:02:07,504 --> 01:02:08,875
Are you okay?

1047
01:02:08,905 --> 01:02:10,342
Yeah, I'm fine.

1048
01:02:10,372 --> 01:02:12,044
Dad, I'm sorry that I
left without telling you,

1049
01:02:12,074 --> 01:02:14,080
I just, I wasn't thinking.

1050
01:02:14,110 --> 01:02:15,096
Don't worry about it, honey.

1051
01:02:15,111 --> 01:02:16,348
Where are you?

1052
01:02:16,378 --> 01:02:17,617
Chicago.

1053
01:02:17,647 --> 01:02:19,686
And this tornado hit
and killed everyone

1054
01:02:19,716 --> 01:02:20,987
on our bus and then these guys

1055
01:02:21,017 --> 01:02:23,222
in suits showed up and they said

1056
01:02:23,252 --> 01:02:26,058
that you were with them
and then I went with them.

1057
01:02:26,088 --> 01:02:27,041
Don't listen to them.

1058
01:02:27,056 --> 01:02:27,975
They're lying about everything.

1059
01:02:27,990 --> 01:02:28,976
They're trying to cover this up.

1060
01:02:28,991 --> 01:02:29,977
Are you still with them?

1061
01:02:29,992 --> 01:02:31,193
No, I ditched them.

1062
01:02:32,094 --> 01:02:33,299
Where are you now?

1063
01:02:33,329 --> 01:02:34,433
Careful, they could
be monitoring the call.

1064
01:02:34,463 --> 01:02:35,382
Honey, don't say anything.

1065
01:02:35,397 --> 01:02:36,969
They might be listening to you.

1066
01:02:36,999 --> 01:02:38,905
We've gotta figure
out where to meet.

1067
01:02:38,935 --> 01:02:42,371
I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be
at Norm's favorite restaurant.

1068
01:02:43,472 --> 01:02:44,291
Norm's favorite restaurant.

1069
01:02:44,306 --> 01:02:45,226
Great idea, honey.

1070
01:02:45,241 --> 01:02:47,146
Go there and wait for us.

1071
01:02:47,176 --> 01:02:48,176
Dad.

1072
01:02:49,311 --> 01:02:50,650
Please hurry.

1073
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:51,814
I will, baby, I will.

1074
01:02:55,652 --> 01:02:57,624
So where does
Norm like to eat?

1075
01:02:57,654 --> 01:02:59,522
The Filling Station
on Union Avenue.

1076
01:03:00,523 --> 01:03:02,495
Best hot dogs in Chicago.

1077
01:03:02,525 --> 01:03:04,527
That's right, that's right.

1078
01:03:23,846 --> 01:03:25,582
Oh my god.

1079
01:03:29,185 --> 01:03:30,587
This is not good.

1080
01:03:50,439 --> 01:03:51,439
Dad!

1081
01:03:53,042 --> 01:03:53,995
Dad!

1082
01:03:54,010 --> 01:03:54,829
Kelly!

1083
01:03:54,844 --> 01:03:55,882
Dad!

1084
01:03:55,912 --> 01:03:57,016
Oh my god.

1085
01:03:57,046 --> 01:03:58,147
I'm so sorry.

1086
01:04:00,349 --> 01:04:01,654
I promise not to scare
you like that again.

1087
01:04:01,684 --> 01:04:02,889
That's alright.

1088
01:04:02,919 --> 01:04:04,090
Oh my god.

1089
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:04,906
I saw it, it
was like a tornado

1090
01:04:04,921 --> 01:04:05,840
but it was different.

1091
01:04:05,855 --> 01:04:07,193
It had three funnel clouds.

1092
01:04:07,223 --> 01:04:08,595
One storm?

1093
01:04:08,625 --> 01:04:11,263
One storm, three funnels,
all interconnected.

1094
01:04:11,293 --> 01:04:12,531
How do they do it?

1095
01:04:12,561 --> 01:04:14,967
How do they manipulate
air flow so precisely?

1096
01:04:14,997 --> 01:04:17,804
There was a signal that
came to me on the bus

1097
01:04:17,834 --> 01:04:20,239
and I re-broadcasted the
signal and it just went away.

1098
01:04:20,269 --> 01:04:22,541
Are you saying that
a tornado responded

1099
01:04:22,571 --> 01:04:23,710
to this signal directly?

1100
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:24,877
Yes.

1101
01:04:24,907 --> 01:04:26,145
Are you sure, Kelly?

1102
01:04:26,175 --> 01:04:27,513
Yes, it saved my life.

1103
01:04:27,543 --> 01:04:28,544
Oh my god.

1104
01:04:29,478 --> 01:04:30,583
What?

1105
01:04:30,613 --> 01:04:31,818
Whatever technology
they're using

1106
01:04:31,848 --> 01:04:33,620
to actually spawn
these twisters,

1107
01:04:33,650 --> 01:04:36,055
the commands must be
coming from somewhere else.

1108
01:04:36,085 --> 01:04:37,790
They're not from
here, are they?

1109
01:04:37,820 --> 01:04:42,261
They're alien and this
is their signal to stop.

1110
01:04:42,291 --> 01:04:44,063
Dad, this is first contact.

1111
01:04:44,093 --> 01:04:45,464
So they can be controlled.

1112
01:04:45,494 --> 01:04:46,447
I think so.

1113
01:04:46,462 --> 01:04:48,034
What do we do now?

1114
01:04:48,064 --> 01:04:49,168
Now we find a
transmission tower

1115
01:04:49,198 --> 01:04:50,532
and we amplify the signal.

1116
01:04:51,533 --> 01:04:52,533
Let's go.

1117
01:05:00,743 --> 01:05:02,945
The bastards took
out the ballpark.

1118
01:05:12,054 --> 01:05:13,054
Oh no.

1119
01:05:18,661 --> 01:05:21,768
There's been a change of plan.

1120
01:05:21,798 --> 01:05:24,000
Take us to the nearest
television station.

1121
01:05:25,301 --> 01:05:27,704
We've got an
announcement to make.

1122
01:05:36,212 --> 01:05:38,117
Come on, baby.

1123
01:05:38,147 --> 01:05:40,853
I know you can go
faster than this.

1124
01:05:40,883 --> 01:05:43,155
Barney, I need
you out of that apartment.

1125
01:05:43,185 --> 01:05:44,171
You know
I'm agoraphobic

1126
01:05:44,186 --> 01:05:45,692
and the city's in chaos.

1127
01:05:45,722 --> 01:05:47,093
I don't wanna hear it, Barn.

1128
01:05:47,123 --> 01:05:49,395
Just get your butt to
Channel 37 as fast as you can

1129
01:05:49,425 --> 01:05:52,064
and bring everything
you have on that signal.

1130
01:05:52,094 --> 01:05:53,232
Channel 37?

1131
01:05:53,262 --> 01:05:54,433
I used to work there.

1132
01:05:54,463 --> 01:05:56,098
The station manager
owes me a favor.

1133
01:06:02,504 --> 01:06:03,424
Take care of the
family, alright?

1134
01:06:03,439 --> 01:06:05,144
All of you, just follow them.

1135
01:06:05,174 --> 01:06:05,993
Take care now.

1136
01:06:06,008 --> 01:06:07,379
Be careful.

1137
01:06:07,409 --> 01:06:08,848
Griff.

1138
01:06:08,878 --> 01:06:11,150
Yeah, we'll you, I understand,
just keep us on the air...

1139
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:11,999
Mike.

1140
01:06:12,014 --> 01:06:12,834
Gail!

1141
01:06:12,849 --> 01:06:13,849
Oh honey.

1142
01:06:15,117 --> 01:06:16,622
Holy, you haven't lost your
sense of timing, have you?

1143
01:06:16,652 --> 01:06:18,324
The Willis Tower just went
down, do you believe that?

1144
01:06:18,354 --> 01:06:19,658
It's like 9/11 around here.

1145
01:06:19,688 --> 01:06:20,893
Now I mean, I have my crew.

1146
01:06:20,923 --> 01:06:22,061
I sent 'em home
to their families.

1147
01:06:22,091 --> 01:06:23,730
It's just me and a
skeleton crew right now.

1148
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:25,197
Listen to me.

1149
01:06:25,227 --> 01:06:26,733
Remember when I brought
you that exclusive coverage

1150
01:06:26,763 --> 01:06:28,667
from the Macon County
storm and you said

1151
01:06:28,697 --> 01:06:30,402
to me that if ever I needed
a favor, just say it?

1152
01:06:30,432 --> 01:06:31,904
I remember that, yeah, yeah.

1153
01:06:31,934 --> 01:06:32,887
I'm here to collect.

1154
01:06:32,902 --> 01:06:34,506
Please, honey, honey.

1155
01:06:34,536 --> 01:06:35,541
I'm a little busy right now.

1156
01:06:35,571 --> 01:06:36,390
Can it wait?

1157
01:06:36,405 --> 01:06:37,844
It's all related.

1158
01:06:37,874 --> 01:06:39,611
Well it'd better be.

1159
01:06:39,641 --> 01:06:42,214
Homeland security, they
just commandeered my studio.

1160
01:06:42,244 --> 01:06:44,383
Homeland security?

1161
01:06:44,413 --> 01:06:46,986
For some public
announcement they wanna make.

1162
01:06:47,016 --> 01:06:49,151
I have to give
you people credit.

1163
01:06:50,452 --> 01:06:51,821
You are persistent.

1164
01:06:52,989 --> 01:06:54,560
Wait a minute.

1165
01:06:54,590 --> 01:06:56,162
You two know each other?

1166
01:06:56,192 --> 01:06:58,828
If by know you mean
dislike intensely, then yes.

1167
01:07:00,229 --> 01:07:01,768
Sheriff's department,
I need to see somebody

1168
01:07:01,798 --> 01:07:02,969
in charge here.

1169
01:07:02,999 --> 01:07:04,170
Norm!

1170
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:05,019
Kelly.

1171
01:07:05,034 --> 01:07:06,272
Mike, listen to me.

1172
01:07:06,302 --> 01:07:07,439
They are not from
homeland security.

1173
01:07:07,469 --> 01:07:08,674
They are not telling
you the truth.

1174
01:07:08,704 --> 01:07:10,342
They are trying to
cover this thing up.

1175
01:07:10,372 --> 01:07:12,544
The situation has
changed, Ms. Curtis.

1176
01:07:12,574 --> 01:07:15,915
We're about to go on the
air to warn the public.

1177
01:07:15,945 --> 01:07:18,751
Congratulations, you
got what you wanted.

1178
01:07:18,781 --> 01:07:21,053
You're gonna tell the
people what's really going on?

1179
01:07:21,083 --> 01:07:24,256
We're gonna tell them what
they need to know to survive.

1180
01:07:24,286 --> 01:07:26,558
I thought you said five minutes.

1181
01:07:26,588 --> 01:07:28,527
Five minutes, seven
minutes, what the hell.

1182
01:07:28,557 --> 01:07:30,459
Alright, come on,
let's do this, guys.

1183
01:07:31,293 --> 01:07:32,561
Alright, this is live.

1184
01:07:33,930 --> 01:07:35,001
It's gonna be live.

1185
01:07:35,031 --> 01:07:35,850
Five.

1186
01:07:35,865 --> 01:07:38,004
Four, three, two.

1187
01:07:38,034 --> 01:07:39,872
My fellow citizens.

1188
01:07:39,902 --> 01:07:42,441
A massive storm
system is bearing down

1189
01:07:42,471 --> 01:07:45,177
on the Chicago
metropolitan area.

1190
01:07:45,207 --> 01:07:47,313
Multiple F5 tornadoes with winds

1191
01:07:47,343 --> 01:07:51,951
in excess of 350 miles
an hour are reported.

1192
01:07:51,981 --> 01:07:54,520
We are asking you
to find shelter

1193
01:07:54,550 --> 01:07:56,688
in basements if you have them

1194
01:07:56,718 --> 01:07:58,858
and turn off all
electronic equipment.

1195
01:07:58,888 --> 01:08:03,059
I repeat, turn off all
electronic equipment.

1196
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:05,294
This is not a drill.

1197
01:08:06,695 --> 01:08:09,798
For your own safety and the
safety of your families,

1198
01:08:10,699 --> 01:08:12,201
stay indoors.

1199
01:08:13,335 --> 01:08:17,874
Stay where you are
until further notice.

1200
01:08:20,609 --> 01:08:22,348
Thank you.

1201
01:08:22,378 --> 01:08:23,846
Thank you very much.

1202
01:08:26,315 --> 01:08:27,268
We're out.

1203
01:08:27,283 --> 01:08:28,587
Alright.

1204
01:08:28,617 --> 01:08:30,452
Turn off all
electronic equipment?

1205
01:08:32,188 --> 01:08:33,007
EMP.

1206
01:08:33,022 --> 01:08:34,193
You're going nuclear.

1207
01:08:34,223 --> 01:08:35,427
You're gonna
nuke a major city?

1208
01:08:35,457 --> 01:08:36,377
Relax.

1209
01:08:36,392 --> 01:08:38,530
No one is nuking anything.

1210
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:39,513
This can't be happening.

1211
01:08:39,528 --> 01:08:40,629
This isn't right here.

1212
01:08:41,697 --> 01:08:43,099
That's not the only thing.

1213
01:08:44,934 --> 01:08:46,205
We're being attacked.

1214
01:08:46,235 --> 01:08:47,054
Attacked?

1215
01:08:47,069 --> 01:08:47,889
By who?

1216
01:08:47,904 --> 01:08:48,941
Aliens.

1217
01:08:48,971 --> 01:08:49,971
Aliens?

1218
01:08:52,274 --> 01:08:53,274
What?

1219
01:08:54,276 --> 01:08:57,216
Suddenly you're all
afraid to say it.

1220
01:08:57,246 --> 01:08:58,814
The girl is right, of course.

1221
01:09:00,016 --> 01:09:02,384
We've known about their
existence for years.

1222
01:09:04,153 --> 01:09:05,557
Data packets.

1223
01:09:05,587 --> 01:09:07,156
Quantum state vectors.

1224
01:09:08,557 --> 01:09:10,859
Traveling through the
universe near light speed.

1225
01:09:12,194 --> 01:09:13,529
No physical bodies.

1226
01:09:14,563 --> 01:09:16,465
No need for spaceships.

1227
01:09:17,566 --> 01:09:19,405
We're being
attacked by ghosts.

1228
01:09:19,435 --> 01:09:21,037
More like energy creatures.

1229
01:09:22,271 --> 01:09:24,610
They manipulate our weather

1230
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:26,946
because it's the only thing they

1231
01:09:26,976 --> 01:09:29,281
can manipulate in
our environment.

1232
01:09:29,311 --> 01:09:30,516
Why are they doing this?

1233
01:09:30,546 --> 01:09:32,151
Maybe they were
attracted to our planet

1234
01:09:32,181 --> 01:09:34,250
because of radio emissions.

1235
01:09:36,752 --> 01:09:38,054
But something's changed.

1236
01:09:39,155 --> 01:09:40,960
Maybe our bandwidth
is so clogged

1237
01:09:40,990 --> 01:09:43,129
with so much
information that they

1238
01:09:43,159 --> 01:09:44,997
can't hear themselves think.

1239
01:09:45,027 --> 01:09:46,362
Maybe they've had enough.

1240
01:09:49,731 --> 01:09:50,731
Armstrong.

1241
01:09:51,567 --> 01:09:53,005
Yes, will advise.

1242
01:09:53,035 --> 01:09:54,303
Go in security.

1243
01:09:55,404 --> 01:09:56,542
Armstrong.

1244
01:09:56,572 --> 01:09:57,576
We can stop this.

1245
01:09:57,606 --> 01:09:59,078
Kelly recorded a transmission.

1246
01:09:59,108 --> 01:10:01,413
She proved it could
turn them back.

1247
01:10:01,443 --> 01:10:04,350
I'm only gonna tell you
this once, Ms. Curtis.

1248
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:06,585
Park your mouth or you're
gonna spend the rest

1249
01:10:06,615 --> 01:10:09,288
of this emergency in handcuffs.

1250
01:10:09,318 --> 01:10:11,390
Or maybe that's what you want.

1251
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:12,688
That goes for all of you.

1252
01:10:14,991 --> 01:10:16,758
Who the hell does
he think he is?

1253
01:10:28,204 --> 01:10:30,876
Northbound Reports
Network has gone hot.

1254
01:10:30,906 --> 01:10:33,312
15 minutes to antenna
synchronization.

1255
01:10:33,342 --> 01:10:35,811
15 minutes to antenna
synchronization.

1256
01:10:40,282 --> 01:10:41,553
Oh Barney.

1257
01:10:41,583 --> 01:10:43,455
You made it, thank
god, you made it.

1258
01:10:43,485 --> 01:10:45,224
Well I almost didn't.

1259
01:10:45,254 --> 01:10:46,892
Freaking storm took my hat off.

1260
01:10:46,922 --> 01:10:48,694
It's Katrina times 10 out there.

1261
01:10:48,724 --> 01:10:51,263
Gail, you know I'm agoraphobic

1262
01:10:51,293 --> 01:10:53,132
and I don't leave my basement!

1263
01:10:53,162 --> 01:10:55,164
I'm sorry to put you
through that, Barney.

1264
01:10:57,066 --> 01:10:58,304
Look.

1265
01:10:58,334 --> 01:11:00,269
I got another one of
those signals on disk.

1266
01:11:01,670 --> 01:11:04,010
It's almost spanning the whole
band of that EM spectrum.

1267
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:05,277
Not someone, something.

1268
01:11:05,307 --> 01:11:07,279
You recorded another one?

1269
01:11:07,309 --> 01:11:08,414
Who's this?

1270
01:11:08,444 --> 01:11:09,881
This is Kelly.

1271
01:11:09,911 --> 01:11:10,949
She's the one who got
the first signal on tape.

1272
01:11:10,979 --> 01:11:11,932
Good work.

1273
01:11:11,947 --> 01:11:13,115
Yeah, let me hear it.

1274
01:11:22,758 --> 01:11:23,892
That's what I have.

1275
01:11:27,396 --> 01:11:29,065
It's not the same.

1276
01:11:40,742 --> 01:11:42,981
The signals are instructions.

1277
01:11:43,011 --> 01:11:45,017
Then this has to be a whole
different command set.

1278
01:11:45,047 --> 01:11:46,418
If we wanna know what
they're talking about,

1279
01:11:46,448 --> 01:11:48,784
we have to find a pattern.

1280
01:11:57,159 --> 01:11:59,398
Something's coming
in from

1281
01:11:59,428 --> 01:12:01,233
Synchronization complete.

1282
01:12:01,263 --> 01:12:03,569
10 seconds to pulse activation.

1283
01:12:03,599 --> 01:12:05,571
Alright everybody.

1284
01:12:05,601 --> 01:12:07,239
Unless you want
your circuits fried,

1285
01:12:07,269 --> 01:12:09,808
turn off all electronic
equipment now.

1286
01:12:09,838 --> 01:12:11,110
Wait a minute.

1287
01:12:11,140 --> 01:12:12,644
The only thing other than a nuke

1288
01:12:12,674 --> 01:12:14,980
with that much power
would be a network

1289
01:12:15,010 --> 01:12:17,183
of ultra wide band radar arrays.

1290
01:12:17,213 --> 01:12:19,151
That's what you're
doing, isn't it?

1291
01:12:19,181 --> 01:12:20,216
That's classified.

1292
01:12:21,083 --> 01:12:22,888
How the hell did you know that?

1293
01:12:22,918 --> 01:12:25,891
You can't classify basic
scientific principles.

1294
01:12:25,921 --> 01:12:26,955
Three seconds.

1295
01:12:28,390 --> 01:12:29,390
Two.

1296
01:12:32,027 --> 01:12:33,027
One.

1297
01:12:39,668 --> 01:12:42,308
Damn, not the power.

1298
01:12:42,338 --> 01:12:43,157
Stay calm.

1299
01:12:43,172 --> 01:12:44,172
Damn it.

1300
01:12:45,474 --> 01:12:46,845
This part of your plan?

1301
01:12:46,875 --> 01:12:47,828
Sitreps, did we get them?

1302
01:12:47,843 --> 01:12:48,843
Checking now.

1303
01:12:50,546 --> 01:12:52,050
Short north com reports
there's a problem.

1304
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:53,452
What, what, what...

1305
01:12:53,482 --> 01:12:54,753
The EMP did not work.

1306
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:56,355
Satellite imagery
shows that the storms

1307
01:12:56,385 --> 01:12:58,320
are actually
increasing in strength.

1308
01:12:59,621 --> 01:13:00,626
No, no, no, no.

1309
01:13:00,656 --> 01:13:03,592
That's inconceivable.

1310
01:13:07,363 --> 01:13:08,363
No.

1311
01:13:21,810 --> 01:13:23,048
Sir, north com
reports the storm

1312
01:13:23,078 --> 01:13:25,217
should be right on top of us.

1313
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:27,153
Everybody in the basement.

1314
01:13:27,183 --> 01:13:28,420
Come on, people, let's go...

1315
01:13:28,450 --> 01:13:31,052
Wait, wait, give me a second.

1316
01:13:32,754 --> 01:13:33,992
Okay.

1317
01:13:34,022 --> 01:13:35,961
You need to switch those
up 'cause if you don't,

1318
01:13:35,991 --> 01:13:37,196
we're back to where we were.

1319
01:13:37,226 --> 01:13:39,161
Come people,
let's go, now, now.

1320
01:13:39,995 --> 01:13:41,300
Hold on, man!

1321
01:13:41,330 --> 01:13:43,802
We're all on the same team now!

1322
01:13:43,832 --> 01:13:46,738
They're on to something,
just hear 'em out.

1323
01:13:46,768 --> 01:13:48,440
We can use the
station's transmitter

1324
01:13:48,470 --> 01:13:51,210
to broadcast the alien
signal back to them.

1325
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:52,058
Send them away.

1326
01:13:52,073 --> 01:13:53,179
It worked once before.

1327
01:13:53,209 --> 01:13:54,813
Maybe it'll work again.

1328
01:13:54,843 --> 01:13:56,915
It doesn't make sense!

1329
01:13:56,945 --> 01:13:59,050
The pulse, the pulse
should've killed them.

1330
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:00,519
Maybe it did!

1331
01:14:00,549 --> 01:14:01,753
Maybe that's why the
storms are getting worse.

1332
01:14:01,783 --> 01:14:04,223
You cut off the head and
the body keeps moving.

1333
01:14:04,253 --> 01:14:05,654
Now they're out of control.

1334
01:14:08,324 --> 01:14:09,324
Fine.

1335
01:14:10,759 --> 01:14:11,759
Try your signal.

1336
01:14:14,062 --> 01:14:15,967
Guys, I need that file.

1337
01:14:15,997 --> 01:14:16,997
Won't work.

1338
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:19,520
What do you mean?

1339
01:14:19,535 --> 01:14:21,006
Means I was wrong.

1340
01:14:21,036 --> 01:14:22,741
That wasn't the
command for stop.

1341
01:14:22,771 --> 01:14:24,876
It was just a
directional vector,

1342
01:14:24,906 --> 01:14:26,478
latitude and longitude.

1343
01:14:26,508 --> 01:14:29,215
It's just gonna send that
tornado right back to Lando.

1344
01:14:29,245 --> 01:14:30,849
How do you know that?

1345
01:14:30,879 --> 01:14:33,084
Because we compared
the different signals

1346
01:14:33,114 --> 01:14:35,187
and we found patterns.

1347
01:14:35,217 --> 01:14:37,155
Enough to use frequency analysis

1348
01:14:37,185 --> 01:14:39,488
to make educated
guesses about syntax.

1349
01:14:40,356 --> 01:14:42,228
It's just a simple binary cipher

1350
01:14:42,258 --> 01:14:44,863
that uses base 11
positional notation.

1351
01:14:44,893 --> 01:14:45,893
That's it.

1352
01:14:48,864 --> 01:14:49,783
That sounds great, honey.

1353
01:14:49,798 --> 01:14:51,703
Can you give me that in English?

1354
01:14:51,733 --> 01:14:53,839
It means they
cracked the alien code.

1355
01:14:53,869 --> 01:14:54,688
What?

1356
01:14:54,703 --> 01:14:55,907
It was mostly her.

1357
01:14:55,937 --> 01:14:58,076
Your daughter's a
natural at this.

1358
01:14:58,106 --> 01:15:00,011
Of course she is, she
takes after her mother.

1359
01:15:00,041 --> 01:15:01,277
No, I take after you.

1360
01:15:02,378 --> 01:15:03,849
So Barney, what about
the second signal?

1361
01:15:03,879 --> 01:15:05,584
Will that one work?

1362
01:15:05,614 --> 01:15:07,015
Yeah, it should.

1363
01:15:07,883 --> 01:15:09,655
What are we waiting for?

1364
01:15:09,685 --> 01:15:12,658
If we can talk to them, why
don't we shut the bastards down?

1365
01:15:12,688 --> 01:15:14,393
I have the kill command ready.

1366
01:15:14,423 --> 01:15:16,161
I just need access
to the transmitter.

1367
01:15:16,191 --> 01:15:17,191
Mike.

1368
01:15:18,394 --> 01:15:20,061
Mike, the transmitter?

1369
01:15:21,797 --> 01:15:23,302
Yeah.

1370
01:15:23,332 --> 01:15:26,905
Yeah, I can patch us into the
main control booth from here.

1371
01:15:26,935 --> 01:15:27,935
Alright.

1372
01:15:30,238 --> 01:15:31,238
Just a second.

1373
01:15:32,441 --> 01:15:33,441
Alright.

1374
01:15:36,578 --> 01:15:37,498
Here.

1375
01:15:37,513 --> 01:15:38,299
Alright, make sure that that...

1376
01:15:38,314 --> 01:15:39,232
Hold on.

1377
01:15:39,247 --> 01:15:40,233
Double check that.

1378
01:15:40,248 --> 01:15:41,887
Alright.

1379
01:15:41,917 --> 01:15:42,917
Okay.

1380
01:15:43,952 --> 01:15:44,805
I hope this works.

1381
01:15:44,820 --> 01:15:45,820
Why wouldn't it?

1382
01:15:46,888 --> 01:15:48,059
Oh, I said that
out loud, I'm sorry.

1383
01:15:48,089 --> 01:15:49,090
Performance anxiety.

1384
01:15:53,261 --> 01:15:55,267
Alright, you're good to go.

1385
01:15:55,297 --> 01:15:58,400
Alright,
we're all ready.

1386
01:16:00,502 --> 01:16:01,502
Did you send it?

1387
01:16:02,371 --> 01:16:04,376
No, I needed another second.

1388
01:16:04,406 --> 01:16:05,911
I've got flashlights.

1389
01:16:05,941 --> 01:16:07,546
I've got flashlights here!

1390
01:16:07,576 --> 01:16:08,576
Here, here, here.

1391
01:16:09,578 --> 01:16:10,578
Alright.

1392
01:16:12,614 --> 01:16:14,185
You know, must be the genny

1393
01:16:14,215 --> 01:16:15,135
but no one's been
up there in years.

1394
01:16:15,150 --> 01:16:16,355
So what does that mean?

1395
01:16:16,385 --> 01:16:18,557
It means that we're
out of gas, propane,

1396
01:16:18,587 --> 01:16:19,625
or whatever it uses.

1397
01:16:19,655 --> 01:16:21,493
Kelly, go to the basement.

1398
01:16:21,523 --> 01:16:22,761
Dad, I'm not leaving.

1399
01:16:22,791 --> 01:16:24,796
Listen to me, you did
a fantastic job, great.

1400
01:16:24,826 --> 01:16:27,065
But please go to
the basement now.

1401
01:16:27,095 --> 01:16:28,266
Please.

1402
01:16:28,296 --> 01:16:29,115
Okay.

1403
01:16:29,130 --> 01:16:30,536
Thank you.

1404
01:16:30,566 --> 01:16:32,604
An operation this
size must be diesel.

1405
01:16:32,634 --> 01:16:33,454
Where is it?

1406
01:16:33,469 --> 01:16:34,840
It's on the roof.

1407
01:16:34,870 --> 01:16:35,689
On the roof?

1408
01:16:35,704 --> 01:16:36,775
Who designed this place?

1409
01:16:36,805 --> 01:16:37,724
The guy that
designed the Titanic?

1410
01:16:37,739 --> 01:16:38,392
Is it a separate fuel shed?

1411
01:16:38,407 --> 01:16:39,192
No, yes.

1412
01:16:39,207 --> 01:16:40,612
Well I'm not sure.

1413
01:16:40,642 --> 01:16:41,813
Well I haven't been up there...

1414
01:16:41,843 --> 01:16:42,881
Alright, calm down.

1415
01:16:42,911 --> 01:16:44,115
Mike.

1416
01:16:44,145 --> 01:16:45,417
Just show me where
you think it is.

1417
01:16:45,447 --> 01:16:46,818
This way.

1418
01:16:46,848 --> 01:16:47,848
Stay put, Barney.

1419
01:16:58,860 --> 01:17:00,932
I almost forgot
this place was here.

1420
01:17:00,962 --> 01:17:02,934
Here, here, right
here, right here.

1421
01:17:02,964 --> 01:17:03,784
That's it.

1422
01:17:03,799 --> 01:17:04,799
Move it.

1423
01:17:06,167 --> 01:17:07,335
Alright, keys.

1424
01:17:10,972 --> 01:17:12,578
Come on.

1425
01:17:12,608 --> 01:17:14,042
Alright, alright.

1426
01:17:18,580 --> 01:17:19,781
Okay.

1427
01:17:22,384 --> 01:17:23,384
Okay.

1428
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:25,439
This is gonna work.

1429
01:17:25,454 --> 01:17:26,788
This is, it's gonna work.

1430
01:17:28,490 --> 01:17:31,430
Sir, we just got a
clean up and contain order

1431
01:17:31,460 --> 01:17:32,379
from committee.

1432
01:17:32,394 --> 01:17:34,299
All other priorities rescinded.

1433
01:17:34,329 --> 01:17:36,565
They mentioned the Curtis
woman specifically.

1434
01:17:38,099 --> 01:17:42,307
Give me that.

1435
01:17:42,337 --> 01:17:43,375
This is Armstrong.

1436
01:17:43,405 --> 01:17:44,405
Repeat last order.

1437
01:17:50,946 --> 01:17:51,946
What do we do?

1438
01:17:52,981 --> 01:17:55,851
These people cracked a
code we didn't even see.

1439
01:17:57,118 --> 01:17:58,754
They're trying to save lives.

1440
01:17:59,888 --> 01:18:01,823
They're doing a better
job than we have.

1441
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:08,497
Gentlemen, sometimes orders
aren't meant to be followed.

1442
01:18:09,698 --> 01:18:11,700
If you have a problem
with that, say so now.

1443
01:18:15,403 --> 01:18:17,443
Alright, let's saddle up.

1444
01:18:17,473 --> 01:18:18,574
Let's go do some good.

1445
01:18:23,912 --> 01:18:25,116
It looks like you
could use some help.

1446
01:18:25,146 --> 01:18:27,586
Sounds like
a good idea to me.

1447
01:18:27,616 --> 01:18:28,687
No thanks, I got it.

1448
01:18:28,717 --> 01:18:29,888
Gail.

1449
01:18:29,918 --> 01:18:31,122
Damn it, Judd, I'm
not letting anyone else

1450
01:18:31,152 --> 01:18:32,591
risk their life for me.

1451
01:18:32,621 --> 01:18:34,159
Somebody's gotta
stay here and send the signal.

1452
01:18:34,189 --> 01:18:35,393
Yeah, yeah, let's go.

1453
01:18:35,423 --> 01:18:36,795
Here's the keys to use
on that generator cage.

1454
01:18:36,825 --> 01:18:38,129
Yeah, now you guys
just have fun.

1455
01:18:38,159 --> 01:18:39,798
We'll just stand by
and wait for you.

1456
01:18:39,828 --> 01:18:40,999
Are
the stairs down here?

1457
01:18:41,029 --> 01:18:42,033
Down at
the end of the hall.

1458
01:18:42,063 --> 01:18:42,883
Judd, hurry.

1459
01:18:42,898 --> 01:18:43,898
Yes ma'am.

1460
01:18:47,803 --> 01:18:48,789
Alright, alright.

1461
01:18:48,804 --> 01:18:50,706
He can do it, he can do it.

1462
01:19:00,516 --> 01:19:02,183
There it is!

1463
01:19:18,266 --> 01:19:19,266
Barney.

1464
01:19:20,201 --> 01:19:21,507
Kelly, what are you doing here?

1465
01:19:21,537 --> 01:19:23,008
You're supposed
to be downstairs.

1466
01:19:23,038 --> 01:19:24,610
Where's dad?

1467
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:26,575
Somebody had to
refuel the generator.

1468
01:19:27,475 --> 01:19:28,614
Why him?

1469
01:19:28,644 --> 01:19:30,649
Because he wanted
it done right.

1470
01:19:30,679 --> 01:19:32,614
He'll be okay, I promise.

1471
01:19:33,949 --> 01:19:35,483
He will,
sweetie, he will, he will.

1472
01:19:51,399 --> 01:19:52,500
This is it!

1473
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:14,993
Two cans should do it!

1474
01:20:15,023 --> 01:20:20,028
Judd, these things
are right on top of us!

1475
01:20:21,563 --> 01:20:22,931
You go back, Norm.

1476
01:20:24,365 --> 01:20:25,971
And what do I tell Kelly
if you don't come back?

1477
01:20:26,001 --> 01:20:27,001
Just go!

1478
01:20:48,023 --> 01:20:49,023
Look out!

1479
01:21:02,237 --> 01:21:03,575
Norm, let's get up!

1480
01:21:03,605 --> 01:21:05,040
Let's get inside!

1481
01:21:21,122 --> 01:21:22,122
Let's go!

1482
01:21:27,696 --> 01:21:29,467
We're back in
business, people!

1483
01:21:29,497 --> 01:21:30,602
Come on.

1484
01:21:30,632 --> 01:21:31,637
Thank you, Judd.

1485
01:21:31,667 --> 01:21:32,668
Send it now!

1486
01:22:02,163 --> 01:22:03,149
Huh?

1487
01:22:03,164 --> 01:22:04,164
The radar.

1488
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:06,337
The radar doesn't show anything!

1489
01:22:06,367 --> 01:22:08,069
The skies are clear!

1490
01:22:14,676 --> 01:22:19,280
We're almost
home.

1491
01:22:21,316 --> 01:22:23,021
Our heroes,
there they are!

1492
01:22:23,051 --> 01:22:24,856
Oh my god, dad!

1493
01:22:24,886 --> 01:22:25,872
Oh my god.

1494
01:22:25,887 --> 01:22:27,092
Hey, are you okay?

1495
01:22:27,122 --> 01:22:28,426
Ah, it's nothing,
Kelly, just my ankle.

1496
01:22:28,456 --> 01:22:30,195
That was really stupid.

1497
01:22:30,225 --> 01:22:31,629
That goes for the both of you.

1498
01:22:31,659 --> 01:22:33,164
Tell me about it.

1499
01:22:33,194 --> 01:22:34,265
Dad.

1500
01:22:34,295 --> 01:22:35,295
Dad.

1501
01:22:47,642 --> 01:22:49,347
Chi-town ain't
got nothing on this.

1502
01:22:49,377 --> 01:22:50,949
You got that right.

1503
01:22:50,979 --> 01:22:52,881
Delivery for Ms. Kelly Walker.

1504
01:22:54,082 --> 01:22:55,353
But wait a second,
that can't be right.

1505
01:22:55,383 --> 01:22:57,585
University of Malaysia?

1506
01:23:01,723 --> 01:23:03,194
Oh my god!

1507
01:23:03,224 --> 01:23:04,562
I got in!

1508
01:23:04,592 --> 01:23:06,127
Oh my god!

1509
01:23:08,396 --> 01:23:09,567
Don't thank me, thank
the US government.

1510
01:23:09,597 --> 01:23:10,802
They're the ones
footing the bill

1511
01:23:10,832 --> 01:23:12,070
and you can thank Ms. Curtis.

1512
01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:14,305
She got us such
a great attorney.

1513
01:23:14,335 --> 01:23:15,841
So good, matter of
fact, that attorney

1514
01:23:15,871 --> 01:23:17,709
thinks he's gonna get your
job back in the big city.

1515
01:23:17,739 --> 01:23:18,810
Ah, no thanks.

1516
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:20,178
I'm staying right here.

1517
01:23:20,208 --> 01:23:21,709
I finally found
something I'm good at.

1518
01:23:22,878 --> 01:23:25,083
What are you gonna
do in Malaysia?

1519
01:23:25,113 --> 01:23:27,715
Not gonna be brushing
horses, I can tell you that.

1520
01:23:36,591 --> 01:23:37,658
Where do you go from here?

1521
01:23:39,060 --> 01:23:42,768
Well technically I can
run a website from anywhere

1522
01:23:42,798 --> 01:23:47,468
so I was thinking about maybe
sticking around for a while.

1523
01:23:52,340 --> 01:23:54,142
Got something on
your mind, cowboy?

1524
01:23:56,344 --> 01:23:57,615
Well they're having
a little shindig

1525
01:23:57,645 --> 01:23:59,480
over at the town
hall this Saturday.

1526
01:24:00,615 --> 01:24:01,615
Yeah?

1527
01:24:02,550 --> 01:24:04,655
I thought maybe
if you weren't busy,

1528
01:24:04,685 --> 01:24:06,855
ah, maybe it's a bad idea.

1529
01:24:08,456 --> 01:24:09,456
Men.
