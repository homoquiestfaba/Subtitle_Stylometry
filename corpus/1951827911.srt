1
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,895
( clock ticking quietly,
man snoring)

2
00:02:32,705 --> 00:02:37,142
<i>BOY: This is one of my favorite
stories of all time,</i>

3
00:02:37,243 --> 00:02:39,905
<i>even though it begins in a basement.</i>

4
00:02:40,013 --> 00:02:41,446
(snoring continues)

5
00:02:41,548 --> 00:02:43,106
<i>I'm gonna tell it
the way it was written</i>

6
00:02:43,216 --> 00:02:45,514
<i>- by this guy-- Bellini--
- (bell ringing)</i>

7
00:02:45,618 --> 00:02:48,712
<i>who lives underneath
the amazing, the remarkable...</i>

8
00:02:48,822 --> 00:02:52,258
<i>Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium.</i>

9
00:02:52,358 --> 00:02:54,053
<i>- (doll squeaks)
- And,yes...</i>

10
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,185
<i>he sleeps with a dolly.</i>

11
00:02:56,296 --> 00:02:57,991
(mechanical whirring)

12
00:03:02,735 --> 00:03:05,203
(quiet moan)

13
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:10,605
<i>BOY: Bellini's job
is to build all the books</i>

14
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,644
<i>for all the kids
who come to the Emporium.</i>

15
00:03:12,745 --> 00:03:18,240
<i>But it is also to chronicle the
life of Mr. Magorium himself.</i>

16
00:03:18,351 --> 00:03:21,752
<i>Mr. Magorium once made toys
for Napoleon,</i>

17
00:03:21,855 --> 00:03:24,449
<i>beat Abraham Lincoln
at hopscotch</i>

18
00:03:24,557 --> 00:03:29,221
<i>and holds the current record
for time spent upside down.</i>

19
00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:32,093
<i>There were those
who called Magorium a genius.</i>

20
00:03:32,198 --> 00:03:34,098
<i>My mom called him an eccentric.</i>

21
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,758
<i>And this one guy from Detroit</i>

22
00:03:35,869 --> 00:03:38,997
<i>inexplicably called him ''Steve. ''</i>

23
00:03:39,105 --> 00:03:40,936
<i>But Magorium's story</i>

24
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,167
<i>was reaching its final chapters.</i>

25
00:03:43,276 --> 00:03:46,768
<i>That's okay--all stories,
even the ones we love,</i>

26
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,041
<i>must eventually come to an end...</i>

27
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,513
<i>...and when they do,</i>

28
00:03:52,619 --> 00:03:55,816
<i>it's only an opportunity
for another story to begin.</i>

29
00:03:55,989 --> 00:03:59,857
<i>So the beginning of the end
begins with a chapter called,</i>

30
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:02,154
<i>''Molly Mahoney's First. ''</i>

31
00:04:02,262 --> 00:04:03,923
(piano playing elegant melody)

32
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:07,090
<i>Molly Mahoney was the manager
of the Emporium,</i>

33
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,227
<i>Mr. Magorium's apprentice,
and my only friend.</i>

34
00:04:11,337 --> 00:04:14,738
<i>In the mornings,
Mahoney would play her piano,</i>

35
00:04:14,841 --> 00:04:17,241
<i>attempting to finish
her very first concerto,</i>

36
00:04:17,343 --> 00:04:21,006
<i>but she never could find
the right notes.</i>

37
00:04:22,081 --> 00:04:24,049
##

38
00:04:31,224 --> 00:04:32,418
<i>When she was younger,</i>

39
00:04:32,525 --> 00:04:34,823
<i>everyone thought
she was a musical genius,</i>

40
00:04:34,928 --> 00:04:37,055
<i>a brilliant pianist,</i>

41
00:04:37,163 --> 00:04:39,063
<i>and she believed them.</i>

42
00:04:39,165 --> 00:04:42,498
<i>But now,
as she became a grown-up,</i>

43
00:04:42,602 --> 00:04:44,502
<i>- (music stops)
- she wasn't so sure.</i>

44
00:04:44,604 --> 00:04:48,370
(playing ''Chopsticks'')

45
00:04:48,474 --> 00:04:50,203
(plays discordant notes)

46
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,505
<i>I don't know why grown-ups
don't believe what they did</i>

47
00:04:52,612 --> 00:04:54,045
<i>when they were kids.</i>

48
00:04:54,147 --> 00:04:57,344
<i>I mean, aren't they supposed
to be smarter?</i>

49
00:04:58,418 --> 00:05:01,216
(piano playing gentle melody)

50
00:05:02,655 --> 00:05:05,249
<i>What Mahoney needed was the
opportunity to prove to herself</i>

51
00:05:05,358 --> 00:05:09,055
<i>that she was something more
than she believed.</i>

52
00:05:09,162 --> 00:05:12,131
(gentle melody continues)

53
00:05:13,733 --> 00:05:17,362
<i>And that opportunity
was about to appear.</i>

54
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:20,997
<i>And so that's how
this chapter begins...</i>

55
00:05:21,107 --> 00:05:24,076
<i>with my hat getting stuck.</i>

56
00:05:27,914 --> 00:05:29,404
MAHONEY: Eric.

57
00:05:29,515 --> 00:05:31,483
Hi, Mahoney.

58
00:05:32,552 --> 00:05:34,042
You're back.

59
00:05:34,153 --> 00:05:35,279
Yeah.

60
00:05:35,388 --> 00:05:37,356
I thought camp was four weeks.

61
00:05:37,457 --> 00:05:39,925
No, no...just the one.

62
00:05:40,026 --> 00:05:40,856
Uh-huh.

63
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,188
My hat's stuck.

64
00:05:42,295 --> 00:05:43,353
Huh.

65
00:05:43,463 --> 00:05:44,953
Looks like you're
gonna need a ladder.

66
00:05:45,064 --> 00:05:46,031
Nah.

67
00:05:46,132 --> 00:05:48,692
I just need to jump higher.

68
00:05:48,801 --> 00:05:51,668
Eric, that's seven feet, at least.

69
00:05:52,739 --> 00:05:54,639
Seven feet?

70
00:05:54,741 --> 00:05:56,231
- Really?
- At least.

71
00:05:58,478 --> 00:05:59,877
You think I should get
a running start?

72
00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:02,607
Yeah.

73
00:06:02,715 --> 00:06:04,444
So, did you make any friends
at camp?

74
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:05,574
Yeah.

75
00:06:05,685 --> 00:06:06,743
Uh...Jeff.

76
00:06:06,853 --> 00:06:08,411
Is Jeff real?

77
00:06:08,521 --> 00:06:10,250
Yeah. Sure.

78
00:06:10,356 --> 00:06:12,586
Is he an animal?

79
00:06:13,659 --> 00:06:15,957
He was a squirrel.

80
00:06:16,062 --> 00:06:16,994
(laughs)

81
00:06:19,165 --> 00:06:20,496
(grunts)

82
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,068
(bell jingling)

83
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:33,038
(all clacking
in various rhythms)

84
00:06:39,252 --> 00:06:42,483
( clicking, whirring)

85
00:06:42,588 --> 00:06:44,055
(bell dings)

86
00:06:44,157 --> 00:06:46,523
(squeaking)

87
00:06:46,626 --> 00:06:48,685
(whirring)

88
00:06:50,763 --> 00:06:52,230
Good morning.

89
00:06:57,737 --> 00:07:00,205
- (toys clicking, dinging)
- ERIC (distant): Gotcha.

90
00:07:00,306 --> 00:07:03,332
(squeaking, creaking)

91
00:07:07,613 --> 00:07:08,841
Uh-oh.

92
00:07:08,948 --> 00:07:10,415
(train whistle blowing)

93
00:07:10,516 --> 00:07:12,916
That's a good way to lose a train.

94
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,095
(man singing indistinctly
in other room)

95
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,300
MAN:
# I love to sing. #

96
00:07:29,402 --> 00:07:31,370
Mahoney.

97
00:07:31,471 --> 00:07:32,495
Morning, sir.

98
00:07:32,605 --> 00:07:33,663
Already?

99
00:07:33,773 --> 00:07:35,764
Drat. Come in, come in.

100
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:38,070
How did you sleep?

101
00:07:38,177 --> 00:07:40,111
Upside down.
Made my feet tingly.

102
00:07:40,213 --> 00:07:41,305
Mortimer, get off the couch.

103
00:07:41,414 --> 00:07:43,143
(sputters)

104
00:07:43,249 --> 00:07:44,511
Do you like turnips?

105
00:07:44,617 --> 00:07:46,778
Nobody likes turnips.

106
00:07:46,886 --> 00:07:48,285
So you probably wouldn't
like turnip pudding.

107
00:07:48,387 --> 00:07:49,479
Probably not.

108
00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:50,954
It's a shame because I made some.

109
00:07:51,057 --> 00:07:53,548
Sir, I was hoping to talk again

110
00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:54,887
about what we spoke about last week.

111
00:07:54,994 --> 00:07:57,019
About how paper
really shouldn't beat rock?

112
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:58,461
No, sir.

113
00:07:58,564 --> 00:08:00,395
About me possibly finding a new job.

114
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,524
That's what I was saying.

115
00:08:01,634 --> 00:08:02,726
What?

116
00:08:02,835 --> 00:08:04,393
I stayed up all night
making turnip pudding,

117
00:08:04,504 --> 00:08:06,028
and thinking, and
it occurred to me

118
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:09,506
that I've owned the Emporium
for over 1 1 3 years.

119
00:08:09,609 --> 00:08:11,509
(needle scratches,
music stops)

120
00:08:11,611 --> 00:08:13,340
That's a very long time, Mahoney.

121
00:08:13,446 --> 00:08:14,743
Yes, it is.

122
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,178
It's almost 1 1 4 years.

123
00:08:16,282 --> 00:08:18,182
And not once
have I even

124
00:08:18,284 --> 00:08:20,844
looked at a receipt,
so I have absolutely no idea

125
00:08:20,953 --> 00:08:23,080
what the store is worth.

126
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:24,247
Well, that's probably not very good.

127
00:08:24,357 --> 00:08:25,415
Exactly.

128
00:08:25,525 --> 00:08:27,516
Mortimer... fetch.

129
00:08:28,594 --> 00:08:31,654
(ball squeaking)

130
00:08:31,764 --> 00:08:33,356
- (Mortimer sputters)
- Stupid zebra.

131
00:08:33,466 --> 00:08:35,263
I'm hiring an accountant.

132
00:08:35,368 --> 00:08:36,426
- A what?
- An accountant.

133
00:08:36,536 --> 00:08:37,798
According to the word,

134
00:08:37,904 --> 00:08:39,838
it must be a cross between
a ''counter'' and a ''mutant.''

135
00:08:39,939 --> 00:08:42,066
And that may be precisely
what we need.

136
00:08:42,175 --> 00:08:43,369
That's great, but...

137
00:08:43,476 --> 00:08:44,568
I'm pretty sure that word
is pronounced...

138
00:08:44,677 --> 00:08:46,440
I placed a call
into one of those agencies

139
00:08:46,546 --> 00:08:49,014
and they said they'd send over
one of their best mutants

140
00:08:49,115 --> 00:08:50,104
sometime today, hmm?

141
00:08:50,216 --> 00:08:51,740
So consider the matter settled.

142
00:08:51,851 --> 00:08:52,749
(bell dings)

143
00:08:52,852 --> 00:08:53,841
How is the matter settled?

144
00:08:53,953 --> 00:08:55,113
Quite perfectly in my opinion.

145
00:08:56,322 --> 00:08:57,482
- Come with me.
- Sir?

146
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:58,716
- Hmm?
- I'm serious.

147
00:08:58,824 --> 00:08:59,848
What?

148
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:01,017
I'm stuck.

149
00:09:01,127 --> 00:09:02,856
Ooh! To my floor?

150
00:09:02,962 --> 00:09:03,860
(laughs): No, sir.

151
00:09:03,963 --> 00:09:04,861
Then what?

152
00:09:04,964 --> 00:09:08,229
Like as a person.

153
00:09:08,334 --> 00:09:10,427
You remember
when I was a little girl,

154
00:09:10,536 --> 00:09:12,265
and I could play Rachmaninoff's
2nd Piano Concerto

155
00:09:12,371 --> 00:09:14,805
and everyone was talking
about my potential?

156
00:09:14,907 --> 00:09:16,465
Mm-hmm.

157
00:09:16,576 --> 00:09:18,100
Well, I am 23 now,

158
00:09:18,211 --> 00:09:21,647
and everyone's still talking
about my potential,

159
00:09:21,747 --> 00:09:26,275
but if you ask me to play
the song I know best...

160
00:09:26,385 --> 00:09:29,047
I'll still play Rachmaninoff's 2nd.

161
00:09:29,155 --> 00:09:31,919
May I suggest
you stun the world

162
00:09:32,024 --> 00:09:34,424
with Molly Mahoney's First?

163
00:09:34,527 --> 00:09:35,960
I want to.

164
00:09:36,062 --> 00:09:38,121
But I am stuck.

165
00:09:40,366 --> 00:09:41,697
Come with me.

166
00:09:44,036 --> 00:09:45,526
(steam hissing)

167
00:09:50,943 --> 00:09:53,104
This, my lovely, is for you.

168
00:09:53,212 --> 00:09:54,509
Thank you.

169
00:09:54,614 --> 00:09:55,740
(gentle chuckle)

170
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:59,015
What is it?

171
00:09:59,118 --> 00:10:00,517
It's the Congreve Cube.

172
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,747
It looks like a big block of wood.

173
00:10:02,855 --> 00:10:04,720
It is a big block of wood.

174
00:10:04,824 --> 00:10:06,815
But now, it's your
big block of wood.

175
00:10:06,926 --> 00:10:08,723
Thank you.

176
00:10:08,828 --> 00:10:10,659
I was just saying
last night

177
00:10:10,763 --> 00:10:12,822
I don't have enough
big blocks of wood.

178
00:10:12,932 --> 00:10:14,297
(giggling)

179
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:18,200
Unlikely adventures
require unlikely tools.

180
00:10:18,304 --> 00:10:20,101
Are we going on an adventure?

181
00:10:20,206 --> 00:10:24,267
Well, my dear, we're already on one.

182
00:10:24,377 --> 00:10:26,868
All I will say is this:

183
00:10:26,979 --> 00:10:30,881
With faith... love...

184
00:10:30,983 --> 00:10:34,976
this block... and
a counting mutant,

185
00:10:35,087 --> 00:10:38,488
you may find yourself somewhere
you've never imagined.

186
00:10:41,594 --> 00:10:44,688
And with that...
let's open the store.

187
00:10:44,797 --> 00:10:45,695
Wait, sir...?

188
00:10:45,798 --> 00:10:46,822
Mortimer, I'm way ahead of you.

189
00:10:46,932 --> 00:10:48,092
Stay out of the refrigerator.

190
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,098
Sir...

191
00:10:49,201 --> 00:10:50,099
Yes, my honeycomb?

192
00:10:50,202 --> 00:10:51,169
You're wearing your pajamas.

193
00:10:53,205 --> 00:10:54,229
Flapdoodle.

194
00:10:56,609 --> 00:10:58,474
( children shouting
happily)

195
00:11:06,385 --> 00:11:07,511
BOY: Fore!

196
00:11:13,059 --> 00:11:15,027
Whoa!

197
00:11:16,128 --> 00:11:17,493
Whoo-whee!

198
00:11:17,596 --> 00:11:19,188
(shouting, laughing)

199
00:11:19,298 --> 00:11:21,664
(twittering, whirring)

200
00:11:23,369 --> 00:11:24,393
( crackling, buzzing)

201
00:11:24,503 --> 00:11:26,403
(applause)

202
00:11:26,505 --> 00:11:28,302
BOY: Whoosh!

203
00:11:28,407 --> 00:11:30,739
(kids laughing)

204
00:11:30,843 --> 00:11:33,368
Eric, may I borrow your hat?

205
00:11:33,479 --> 00:11:34,468
Sure!

206
00:11:42,388 --> 00:11:44,686
WOMAN: Oh, excuse me. Hello.

207
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,758
Uh, how much are you asking
for that fish mobile up there?

208
00:11:46,859 --> 00:11:47,985
- Oh, that one.
- Yeah.

209
00:11:48,094 --> 00:11:49,026
Well, that's $50.

210
00:11:49,128 --> 00:11:50,618
- Fifty!
- Mm-hmm.

211
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:53,028
50-- don't you think that's a
little high,just for a mobile?

212
00:11:53,132 --> 00:11:55,600
Well, if you'll notice,
they're fresh fish.

213
00:11:55,701 --> 00:11:58,534
(squeaking, gibbering)

214
00:11:58,637 --> 00:11:59,899
Uh...

215
00:12:00,005 --> 00:12:01,666
If you don't want
to spend that much,

216
00:12:01,774 --> 00:12:05,210
we do have that fish mobile
over there for only $1 7.

217
00:12:05,311 --> 00:12:07,302
But those are not fresh.

218
00:12:07,413 --> 00:12:10,143
And they're high in cholesterol.

219
00:12:11,317 --> 00:12:12,477
(bell dings)

220
00:12:12,585 --> 00:12:16,112
(piano glissando playing)

221
00:12:16,222 --> 00:12:17,951
Molly? Molly Mahoney?

222
00:12:18,057 --> 00:12:18,955
Yeah.

223
00:12:19,058 --> 00:12:21,219
It's Dave. Dave Wolf.

224
00:12:21,327 --> 00:12:23,227
I was in your physics
class in college.

225
00:12:23,329 --> 00:12:24,353
Oh, hey!

226
00:12:24,463 --> 00:12:26,829
Hey! Holy... cow.
You still work here?

227
00:12:26,932 --> 00:12:27,864
Yeah!

228
00:12:27,967 --> 00:12:29,992
I mean, well... yeah.

229
00:12:30,102 --> 00:12:33,071
So, uh, what about you?
What are you up to?

230
00:12:33,172 --> 00:12:34,434
I'm an engineer.

231
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,064
Congratulations.

232
00:12:36,175 --> 00:12:37,335
You know, it's funny.

233
00:12:37,443 --> 00:12:38,842
I would never have
recognized you

234
00:12:38,944 --> 00:12:40,639
if it wasn't for that finger thing.

235
00:12:40,746 --> 00:12:43,214
Hah-- comes in handy
on the cash register.

236
00:12:43,315 --> 00:12:45,146
Do you still play the piano?

237
00:12:45,251 --> 00:12:46,616
I do. Every day.

238
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:49,313
Well, I'm here for a week.
Where are you playing?

239
00:12:49,422 --> 00:12:50,946
My apartment.

240
00:12:51,056 --> 00:12:52,489
Oh, I-I thought...

241
00:12:52,591 --> 00:12:55,151
Yeah-- do you want me to wrap
any of these for you?

242
00:12:55,261 --> 00:12:56,421
Oh, no. Thanks.

243
00:12:56,529 --> 00:12:59,157
Uh... you know, it was
really nice to see you.

244
00:12:59,265 --> 00:13:01,130
I always wondered
what happened to you.

245
00:13:01,233 --> 00:13:01,995
It's good to see you.

246
00:13:02,101 --> 00:13:02,999
Yeah, you too.

247
00:13:03,102 --> 00:13:04,831
Wait, I'm... I'm sorry.

248
00:13:04,937 --> 00:13:07,201
Bouncy Balls--
always trying to escape.

249
00:13:07,306 --> 00:13:09,501
Okay, out.

250
00:13:11,143 --> 00:13:12,167
Out.

251
00:13:12,278 --> 00:13:14,303
And you.

252
00:13:14,413 --> 00:13:15,710
You, too.

253
00:13:15,815 --> 00:13:17,373
Sorry about that.

254
00:13:17,483 --> 00:13:18,814
Take care.

255
00:13:18,918 --> 00:13:20,886
Okay.

256
00:13:22,121 --> 00:13:23,554
(humming)

257
00:13:23,656 --> 00:13:25,715
Ooh!

258
00:13:25,825 --> 00:13:26,951
Aha...

259
00:13:27,059 --> 00:13:28,026
(kids giggling)

260
00:13:28,127 --> 00:13:29,355
Hiya.

261
00:13:29,462 --> 00:13:31,657
Just, uh... uh, shopping.

262
00:13:31,764 --> 00:13:33,322
Shopping.

263
00:13:33,432 --> 00:13:35,900
Just, uh... shopping.

264
00:13:36,001 --> 00:13:37,229
No matter what they tell you,

265
00:13:37,336 --> 00:13:39,031
you don't have to stay in the lines.

266
00:13:39,138 --> 00:13:40,196
WOMAN: Pardon me, miss.

267
00:13:40,306 --> 00:13:41,398
Could you help me, please?

268
00:13:41,507 --> 00:13:43,168
I can certainly try.

269
00:13:43,275 --> 00:13:46,802
My grandson wants a fire engine
for his birthday,

270
00:13:46,912 --> 00:13:48,641
with a ladder
that goes up

271
00:13:48,747 --> 00:13:50,772
and a hose that squirts water.

272
00:13:50,883 --> 00:13:52,214
And I can't find one.

273
00:13:52,318 --> 00:13:54,582
This sounds like a job
for the Big Book.

274
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:02,589
This has all the toys
we have in stock.

275
00:14:02,695 --> 00:14:07,997
Now, ''E'' for engine
or ''F'' for fire...?

276
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,967
Let's try ''F.''

277
00:14:15,841 --> 00:14:17,741
- (pages thud)
- (siren wails, bell clangs)

278
00:14:17,843 --> 00:14:19,037
Wow!

279
00:14:19,144 --> 00:14:21,009
How did you do that?

280
00:14:21,113 --> 00:14:22,444
I didn't do it.

281
00:14:22,548 --> 00:14:24,709
You must have done something.

282
00:14:24,817 --> 00:14:26,148
Surprisingly, no.

283
00:14:26,252 --> 00:14:28,083
It's the Book.

284
00:14:28,187 --> 00:14:30,712
It's magic.

285
00:14:30,823 --> 00:14:32,552
Come on, guys.
Bring it up higher!

286
00:14:32,658 --> 00:14:33,590
Higher!
That's it!

287
00:14:33,692 --> 00:14:35,683
Hey, get that bird
out of here, will ya?

288
00:14:35,794 --> 00:14:37,489
Hey. Whoa.
Okay, that's right.

289
00:14:37,596 --> 00:14:39,757
All right, bring it up,
bring it up, bring it up.

290
00:14:39,865 --> 00:14:41,423
(toilet flushes)

291
00:14:41,534 --> 00:14:42,523
( clanks)

292
00:14:42,735 --> 00:14:44,464
MAN: Hello, excuse me, miss. Hi.

293
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:46,265
Oh, hi.

294
00:14:46,372 --> 00:14:48,431
Um... hi.

295
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:50,031
Um...

296
00:14:50,142 --> 00:14:51,803
Hello.
(nervous chuckle)

297
00:14:51,911 --> 00:14:54,277
Um... I believe Mr. Magorium
sent for me.

298
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,712
Oh. Wow.

299
00:14:56,815 --> 00:14:59,875
You're really well-dressed
for a shadow puppeteer.

300
00:14:59,985 --> 00:15:01,282
(laughs nervously)

301
00:15:01,387 --> 00:15:04,413
No, no... I'm Henry Weston,
the accountant.

302
00:15:04,523 --> 00:15:05,581
Here for an interview.

303
00:15:05,691 --> 00:15:07,591
Ah... hello.

304
00:15:07,693 --> 00:15:08,990
My name is Mahoney.

305
00:15:09,094 --> 00:15:10,618
I am the store manager.

306
00:15:10,729 --> 00:15:12,663
Pleasure to meet you.

307
00:15:12,765 --> 00:15:15,029
I have to admit,
when the agency sent me,

308
00:15:15,134 --> 00:15:17,625
I had no idea
that this was a toy store.

309
00:15:17,736 --> 00:15:19,465
Shh!

310
00:15:21,373 --> 00:15:23,273
If these kids found out
this was a toy store,

311
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:24,842
we'd have a madhouse on our hands.

312
00:15:27,913 --> 00:15:30,609
That was a joke.

313
00:15:30,716 --> 00:15:33,014
I know.

314
00:15:33,118 --> 00:15:34,608
Okay.

315
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,018
Uh... you probably want to speak

316
00:15:37,122 --> 00:15:39,022
to Mr. Magorium.

317
00:15:39,124 --> 00:15:40,989
Why don't you give me a second.

318
00:15:43,362 --> 00:15:45,330
BOY: Hi.

319
00:15:49,201 --> 00:15:51,294
What is it?

320
00:15:55,374 --> 00:15:57,342
(whispers): What?

321
00:16:05,918 --> 00:16:09,149
It's not real nice
to stare at people, you know?

322
00:16:09,254 --> 00:16:10,414
Why don't you just

323
00:16:10,522 --> 00:16:12,114
go ahead and...
(grunts in pain)

324
00:16:12,224 --> 00:16:13,782
This happens every time.

325
00:16:13,892 --> 00:16:15,450
Ah, greetings.
Edward Magorium--

326
00:16:15,561 --> 00:16:17,119
toy impresario,
wonder aficionado,

327
00:16:17,229 --> 00:16:18,457
avid shoe-wearer.

328
00:16:18,564 --> 00:16:20,293
You're here for the
accounting position.

329
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:21,457
Yes. Henry Weston.

330
00:16:21,567 --> 00:16:23,125
Mm-hmm. Name the
Fibonacci series

331
00:16:23,235 --> 00:16:25,100
from its 1 1 th to its 1 6th integer.

332
00:16:25,204 --> 00:16:26,262
Hello? Grandma?

333
00:16:26,372 --> 00:16:27,930
Uh... 89,

334
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,565
1 44, 233,

335
00:16:30,676 --> 00:16:32,075
377, 61 0?

336
00:16:32,177 --> 00:16:33,201
Perfect.

337
00:16:33,312 --> 00:16:35,246
The number four--
do we really need it?

338
00:16:35,347 --> 00:16:37,212
If you like squares, you do.

339
00:16:37,316 --> 00:16:38,715
Oh, I like squares.

340
00:16:38,817 --> 00:16:40,045
Good. Now,

341
00:16:40,152 --> 00:16:42,416
the hot dog to
hot dog bun ratio--

342
00:16:42,521 --> 00:16:45,752
why, for the love of mustard,
are there never enough buns?

343
00:16:46,825 --> 00:16:48,554
Extra hot dogs.

344
00:16:48,661 --> 00:16:49,593
Yes, but why?

345
00:16:49,695 --> 00:16:51,720
In case you drop a couple.

346
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:55,231
What kind of insufferable
fool drops a hot dog?

347
00:16:55,334 --> 00:16:56,995
Anything can happen, sir.

348
00:17:01,473 --> 00:17:03,600
Anything can happen, hmm?

349
00:17:04,977 --> 00:17:07,002
How absolutely true.

350
00:17:08,313 --> 00:17:12,044
You're exactly the mutant
I'm looking for.

351
00:17:12,151 --> 00:17:13,413
You're hired.

352
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:14,577
What?

353
00:17:14,687 --> 00:17:16,348
- You're hired!
- That's it, huh?

354
00:17:16,455 --> 00:17:18,047
- That's all I need.
- Uh, sir...

355
00:17:18,157 --> 00:17:19,920
- Don't you agree, Mahoney?
- No, not exactly.

356
00:17:20,025 --> 00:17:22,425
Perfect. I've heard
great things about you.

357
00:17:22,528 --> 00:17:23,495
Really?

358
00:17:23,595 --> 00:17:25,756
No, not yet,
but I'm sure I will. Oh!

359
00:17:25,864 --> 00:17:27,798
I see you've brought
your abacus along. Top-notch.

360
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:28,867
Come along.

361
00:17:28,967 --> 00:17:31,595
I'll show you the store.

362
00:17:31,704 --> 00:17:33,035
# Bum, bum, bum #

363
00:17:33,138 --> 00:17:35,766
#The store and then I'll
show you my office... #

364
00:17:35,874 --> 00:17:37,774
GI RL: Duck, duck, duck...

365
00:17:37,876 --> 00:17:39,207
- (goose squawks)
- goose!

366
00:17:39,311 --> 00:17:41,541
( excited squawking)

367
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:47,751
We sell almost every kind
of whatnot imaginable, Mutant,

368
00:17:47,853 --> 00:17:49,411
from ant farms to zeppelins.

369
00:17:49,521 --> 00:17:51,614
I've owned this store
for 1 1 3 years,

370
00:17:51,724 --> 00:17:53,715
ever since I came
to this country,

371
00:17:53,826 --> 00:17:57,762
although I've been inventing
toys since the mid-1 77 0s.

372
00:17:57,863 --> 00:17:59,592
- Wha... Excuse me, sir?
- Yes?

373
00:17:59,698 --> 00:18:01,962
Did you say 1 77 0s?

374
00:18:02,067 --> 00:18:04,160
Yes, sir. So, as you
can imagine, accounting

375
00:18:04,269 --> 00:18:05,634
is a brand-new concept to me.

376
00:18:05,738 --> 00:18:08,673
You know, that would make you
at least 2 40 years old, sir.

377
00:18:08,774 --> 00:18:11,242
You're already hired, Mutant.
There's no need to show off.

378
00:18:11,343 --> 00:18:13,777
Now, follow me.

379
00:18:25,424 --> 00:18:27,392
Here we are.

380
00:18:29,061 --> 00:18:31,427
I haven't thrown anything away.

381
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:33,464
Yeah, yeah, I can see that.

382
00:18:33,565 --> 00:18:35,829
Are-are all these receipts?

383
00:18:35,934 --> 00:18:38,300
Mostly. Some are
important documents.

384
00:18:38,403 --> 00:18:40,337
Others might be doodles
I never framed.

385
00:18:40,439 --> 00:18:41,838
I can't tell the difference.

386
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:46,502
So you've obviously never kept
an account of your income.

387
00:18:46,612 --> 00:18:47,579
No.

388
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,044
Or filed a tax return?

389
00:18:49,148 --> 00:18:50,046
No.

390
00:18:50,149 --> 00:18:51,309
Renewed your city business license?

391
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:52,713
Renewed my...?

392
00:18:52,818 --> 00:18:54,308
Renewed your...
Eh, forget it.

393
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:56,853
You realize to
determine the worth

394
00:18:56,955 --> 00:19:01,153
of this store out of this,
um... fire hazard, really,

395
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:04,821
is an insurmountable task,
and if you have...

396
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:07,797
somehow managed to keep
from going bankrupt

397
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,834
or being evicted,

398
00:19:09,935 --> 00:19:11,766
sent to prison for
tax evasion, uh...

399
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:12,962
Oh-ho.

400
00:19:13,071 --> 00:19:14,732
...why do you want to do this now?

401
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,239
Ah, yes.
Can you keep a secret?

402
00:19:16,341 --> 00:19:18,707
The firm holds a very strict
exclusivity policy.

403
00:19:18,811 --> 00:19:20,005
Don't worry.

404
00:19:20,112 --> 00:19:23,047
But can you keep a secret?

405
00:19:23,148 --> 00:19:24,479
Yes, sir.

406
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,141
I'm leaving.

407
00:19:26,251 --> 00:19:27,582
The store?

408
00:19:27,686 --> 00:19:29,847
The world.

409
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:32,655
You see these shoes?

410
00:19:32,758 --> 00:19:35,192
I found these
in a tiny little shop

411
00:19:35,294 --> 00:19:37,125
in Tuscany

412
00:19:37,229 --> 00:19:39,322
and fell in love with them
so entirely,

413
00:19:39,431 --> 00:19:42,867
I bought enough
to last my whole life.

414
00:19:42,968 --> 00:19:44,595
( chuckles)

415
00:19:49,474 --> 00:19:51,203
These are my last pair.

416
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,504
( chuckles)

417
00:19:58,784 --> 00:20:02,811
So, if you'll excuse me,
I have a pressing marbles match,

418
00:20:02,921 --> 00:20:04,320
and I must warm up

419
00:20:04,423 --> 00:20:05,890
my thumbs.

420
00:20:13,031 --> 00:20:15,431
(rumbling, creaking)

421
00:20:18,337 --> 00:20:21,306
(rumbling, creaking, crackling)

422
00:20:24,509 --> 00:20:28,275
(mysterious breathing,
rumbling, creaking)

423
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,905
MAGORI UM:
Eric! Are you ready

424
00:20:31,016 --> 00:20:32,916
for our marbles match?

425
00:20:33,018 --> 00:20:34,883
- Mr. Magorium?
- Yes?

426
00:20:34,987 --> 00:20:37,455
- Does that seem right to you?
- Does what...?

427
00:20:37,556 --> 00:20:41,424
(rumbling, breathing, crackling)

428
00:20:43,562 --> 00:20:46,395
MAGORI UM:
No, this doesn't seem right at all.

429
00:20:46,498 --> 00:20:50,229
We must keep a watchful
eye on this, Eric, hmm?

430
00:20:50,335 --> 00:20:52,997
(rumbling, crackling)

431
00:20:55,674 --> 00:20:58,837
(stopping and starting
same phrase)

432
00:21:00,379 --> 00:21:02,643
(stops playing)

433
00:21:02,748 --> 00:21:05,216
(plays short phrase)

434
00:21:07,052 --> 00:21:09,452
(playing gentle, minor-key song)

435
00:21:09,554 --> 00:21:11,886
(piano continues playing)

436
00:21:16,094 --> 00:21:18,392
- (orchestra playing gentle song)
- (beep)

437
00:21:28,307 --> 00:21:30,366
##

438
00:21:36,081 --> 00:21:39,050
(kids talking indistinctly)

439
00:21:40,886 --> 00:21:44,686
Don't worry, I'm...
fine up here, guys.

440
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:46,985
(kids talking indistinctly)

441
00:21:47,092 --> 00:21:48,286
(beep)

442
00:21:48,393 --> 00:21:50,691
(lively piano piece finishes)

443
00:21:54,866 --> 00:21:56,857
<i>ERIC:
This chapter is called</i>

444
00:21:56,969 --> 00:21:59,369
<i>''No, Seriously, Watch. ''</i>

445
00:22:02,874 --> 00:22:04,603
No, seriously,

446
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:06,507
watch.

447
00:22:07,546 --> 00:22:10,640
(Bouncy Balls gibbering,
boinging)

448
00:22:10,749 --> 00:22:12,546
No way!

449
00:22:12,651 --> 00:22:13,583
Come on.

450
00:22:13,685 --> 00:22:14,617
Whoa!

451
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,053
This is so cool.

452
00:22:18,156 --> 00:22:20,317
(boinging)

453
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,851
- Come on!
- Let's go!

454
00:22:46,618 --> 00:22:48,381
(honks, whistles)

455
00:22:52,824 --> 00:22:54,348
Wow!

456
00:23:14,946 --> 00:23:15,878
Uh-oh.

457
00:23:19,651 --> 00:23:22,051
(yelling)

458
00:23:23,188 --> 00:23:24,985
It's so good.

459
00:23:26,391 --> 00:23:27,949
Somebody!

460
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:30,392
Help! Help!

461
00:23:30,495 --> 00:23:32,463
(thud)

462
00:23:32,564 --> 00:23:34,589
(pounding on door)

463
00:23:35,934 --> 00:23:37,060
(laughs)

464
00:23:37,169 --> 00:23:39,069
Pretty impressive ball, isn't it?

465
00:23:39,171 --> 00:23:41,139
Impossible to dodge.

466
00:23:42,808 --> 00:23:44,901
(indistinct chatter)

467
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:46,739
( chatter stops)

468
00:23:46,845 --> 00:23:48,938
(whispers): This boy's weird.

469
00:23:49,047 --> 00:23:52,346
(indistinct chatter resumes)

470
00:24:10,869 --> 00:24:12,359
HENRY:
Mahoney,

471
00:24:12,471 --> 00:24:13,961
have you seen Mister...

472
00:24:14,072 --> 00:24:15,039
Good night!

473
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,505
Have you seen Mr. Magorium?

474
00:24:16,608 --> 00:24:19,509
Yeah. He's, um,
he's about this tall.

475
00:24:19,611 --> 00:24:21,579
He's got crazy eyebrows...

476
00:24:24,216 --> 00:24:25,774
He's upstairs.

477
00:24:25,884 --> 00:24:27,112
Thank you.

478
00:24:27,219 --> 00:24:29,915
You really got to get better
with the jokes, Mutant.

479
00:24:30,021 --> 00:24:32,046
I'm laughing on the inside.

480
00:24:32,157 --> 00:24:34,682
(sticks whooshing through air)

481
00:24:37,629 --> 00:24:40,894
(birds chirping, twittering)

482
00:24:40,999 --> 00:24:44,059
- HENRY: Mr. Magorium.
- Mutant.

483
00:24:44,169 --> 00:24:45,397
Mr. Magorium...

484
00:24:45,504 --> 00:24:47,972
Come to accept
my hula hoop challenge?

485
00:24:48,073 --> 00:24:49,540
We have a few serious problems.

486
00:24:49,641 --> 00:24:50,903
Ooh, serious problems.

487
00:24:51,009 --> 00:24:52,772
I don't have any serious problems.

488
00:24:52,878 --> 00:24:53,936
You do, actually.

489
00:24:54,045 --> 00:24:55,171
I don't think so.

490
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,804
What about this, uh, invoice

491
00:24:56,915 --> 00:24:58,109
from this company in Brazil?

492
00:24:58,216 --> 00:24:59,240
They say that

493
00:24:59,351 --> 00:25:01,819
you owe them $300,000
for a magic

494
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,615
doorknob?

495
00:25:03,722 --> 00:25:05,189
Oh, that's ridiculous.

496
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:06,484
- Thank you.
- (Magorium chuckles)

497
00:25:06,591 --> 00:25:09,788
$300,000 for a doorknob?

498
00:25:09,895 --> 00:25:12,022
I've never paid over $200,000.

499
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:13,392
Here, catch.

500
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,268
What about Bellini?

501
00:25:17,369 --> 00:25:18,336
Bellini's the
book builder

502
00:25:18,436 --> 00:25:19,425
born in the basement.

503
00:25:19,538 --> 00:25:20,937
You have a tenant in the basement?

504
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:22,404
He was born there.

505
00:25:22,507 --> 00:25:24,168
I certainly can't ask him to leave.

506
00:25:24,276 --> 00:25:25,265
Okay.

507
00:25:25,377 --> 00:25:27,174
According to your
employment records,

508
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:29,611
you've had several fictional
characters on the books.

509
00:25:29,714 --> 00:25:32,182
- Like whom?
- The King of Planet Yaweh.

510
00:25:32,284 --> 00:25:33,114
Oh, he's not fictional.

511
00:25:33,218 --> 00:25:34,185
Sir, there are people...

512
00:25:34,286 --> 00:25:35,275
He's not really
the king,

513
00:25:35,387 --> 00:25:37,082
and the planet Yaweh
doesn't exist,

514
00:25:37,189 --> 00:25:38,884
but he's not fictional.

515
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:40,423
Well, that's the thing.

516
00:25:40,525 --> 00:25:41,457
If there's no planet...

517
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,652
- Mr. Weston,
- Yes, sir?

518
00:25:42,761 --> 00:25:46,060
you can't blame people
for having aspirations, hmm?

519
00:25:46,164 --> 00:25:49,133
(whimsical march playing)

520
00:25:58,877 --> 00:26:01,004
Oh.

521
00:26:01,112 --> 00:26:02,545
Sorry.

522
00:26:02,647 --> 00:26:05,810
I just sort of took over.

523
00:26:05,917 --> 00:26:08,715
I thought it was
funny, but I guess...

524
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,947
Sorry.

525
00:26:16,027 --> 00:26:17,858
Hey, who did that?

526
00:26:17,963 --> 00:26:19,225
I did that.

527
00:26:19,331 --> 00:26:21,390
No, seriously, who helped?

528
00:26:21,499 --> 00:26:23,126
No one.

529
00:26:24,469 --> 00:26:26,869
Mahoney? Hello.
Got a quick question.

530
00:26:26,972 --> 00:26:28,269
Quick one. Quickie. Hey.

531
00:26:28,373 --> 00:26:29,465
Okay, Mutant.

532
00:26:29,574 --> 00:26:31,804
I need your help
explaining this history

533
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:33,639
that Mr. Magorium has fabricated.

534
00:26:33,745 --> 00:26:35,303
What history he's fabricated?

535
00:26:35,413 --> 00:26:37,313
This one I've got
here-- for instance,

536
00:26:37,415 --> 00:26:39,940
got a signed I.O.U.
from Thomas Edison.

537
00:26:40,051 --> 00:26:41,109
Really?!

538
00:26:41,219 --> 00:26:42,880
''P.S. Thanks for the idea.''

539
00:26:42,988 --> 00:26:45,456
With a picture of the
lightbulb next to it.

540
00:26:45,557 --> 00:26:47,286
Is that for real?

541
00:26:47,392 --> 00:26:49,019
No. No, it's...
it's not for real.

542
00:26:49,127 --> 00:26:50,685
It's a signed I.O.U.
from Thomas Edison.

543
00:26:50,795 --> 00:26:51,887
Does that seem
like something

544
00:26:51,997 --> 00:26:54,022
that would exist in
the real world to you?

545
00:26:54,132 --> 00:26:56,464
Well, it does have
his signature on it.

546
00:26:58,903 --> 00:27:00,598
Hello? Please?

547
00:27:00,705 --> 00:27:02,104
Give me one second, please?

548
00:27:02,207 --> 00:27:03,231
Mahoney, wait.

549
00:27:03,341 --> 00:27:04,638
I just need...

550
00:27:04,743 --> 00:27:07,576
a simple explanation.

551
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,204
Sure. It's a magical toy store.

552
00:27:10,315 --> 00:27:13,148
There's no such thing
as a magical toy store.

553
00:27:13,251 --> 00:27:14,616
Of course there is.

554
00:27:14,719 --> 00:27:16,846
When you say ''magical,''
do you mean ''special''?

555
00:27:16,955 --> 00:27:18,650
- No, I mean ''magical.''
- ''Unique''?

556
00:27:18,757 --> 00:27:20,190
- ''Magical.''
- How about...

557
00:27:20,292 --> 00:27:21,725
(goofy grunt)

558
00:27:21,826 --> 00:27:23,259
''Really, really cool''?

559
00:27:25,096 --> 00:27:26,358
(quietly): Okay.

560
00:27:26,464 --> 00:27:29,695
What's behind me, all right...

561
00:27:29,801 --> 00:27:30,790
is a toy store.

562
00:27:30,902 --> 00:27:33,496
It is a big one,
it is a weird one,

563
00:27:33,605 --> 00:27:36,039
but it is just...

564
00:27:36,141 --> 00:27:38,006
a toy store.

565
00:27:38,109 --> 00:27:39,406
I knew it

566
00:27:39,511 --> 00:27:41,240
as soon as I saw that suit.

567
00:27:41,346 --> 00:27:42,313
Knew what?

568
00:27:42,414 --> 00:27:44,041
You're a ''just'' guy.

569
00:27:44,149 --> 00:27:45,138
What's a ''just'' guy?

570
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:46,478
A guy just like you.

571
00:27:46,584 --> 00:27:49,519
Same hair, same suit, same shoes.

572
00:27:49,621 --> 00:27:50,986
Walks around.

573
00:27:51,089 --> 00:27:53,683
No matter what,
he thinks, ''Oh,

574
00:27:53,792 --> 00:27:55,020
''it's just a store.

575
00:27:55,126 --> 00:27:57,356
''This is just a bench.

576
00:27:57,462 --> 00:27:59,555
''It's just a tree.''

577
00:27:59,664 --> 00:28:02,224
It's just what it is, nothing more.

578
00:28:02,334 --> 00:28:04,529
Okay, but-but this...

579
00:28:04,636 --> 00:28:06,627
is just a store.

580
00:28:08,406 --> 00:28:11,204
I'm sure to you... it is.

581
00:28:11,309 --> 00:28:15,075
(piano and orchestra playing)

582
00:28:39,304 --> 00:28:43,263
- (humming piano melody)
- (sportscast playing on Tv)

583
00:28:45,343 --> 00:28:47,903
(race cars roaring over Tv)

584
00:28:49,581 --> 00:28:51,549
(soft crackling)

585
00:28:53,818 --> 00:28:56,150
(sighs)

586
00:28:56,254 --> 00:28:59,223
(playing gentle, minor-key song)

587
00:29:01,192 --> 00:29:03,160
(birds chirping)

588
00:29:04,629 --> 00:29:06,426
(plays two notes)

589
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:10,432
(orchestra playing
same minor-key theme)

590
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:23,047
##

591
00:29:25,683 --> 00:29:27,310
(Mahoney plays two notes)

592
00:29:28,386 --> 00:29:30,183
(sighs)

593
00:29:34,426 --> 00:29:36,326
(hinges squeak)

594
00:29:38,663 --> 00:29:41,291
##

595
00:29:43,568 --> 00:29:46,628
I must say...

596
00:29:46,738 --> 00:29:50,003
I am very disappointed in you.

597
00:29:54,078 --> 00:29:57,605
I understand feeling sad
or scared or even suspicious,

598
00:29:57,715 --> 00:30:01,344
but that is no reason
to turn gray and start pouting.

599
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:08,020
I would expect
such behavior, perhaps,

600
00:30:08,126 --> 00:30:11,357
from a brand-new store,
or even a store a few years old,

601
00:30:11,463 --> 00:30:12,657
but a store

602
00:30:12,764 --> 00:30:14,527
your age...

603
00:30:14,632 --> 00:30:16,725
sulking?

604
00:30:18,703 --> 00:30:20,534
It is simply

605
00:30:20,638 --> 00:30:23,198
atrocious.

606
00:30:25,276 --> 00:30:29,076
The immitigable truth is,
I am leaving tomorrow,

607
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,444
and Mahoney,
bless her timid heart,

608
00:30:31,549 --> 00:30:34,541
will be given care of you.

609
00:30:34,652 --> 00:30:37,553
I'm sorry, my sweet,
but it's a perfect fact,

610
00:30:37,655 --> 00:30:40,749
and no amount of misbehavior
will change it.

611
00:30:43,695 --> 00:30:45,560
She loves you,

612
00:30:45,663 --> 00:30:47,893
as do I,

613
00:30:47,999 --> 00:30:51,594
and we must face tomorrow,
whatever it may hold,

614
00:30:51,703 --> 00:30:55,161
with determination,joy and bravery.

615
00:30:56,941 --> 00:31:00,069
So I suggest
you stop this petulance.

616
00:31:01,145 --> 00:31:02,976
Hmm?

617
00:31:03,081 --> 00:31:05,879
I expect you
to pull yourself together...

618
00:31:07,952 --> 00:31:12,252
...and put your best face on
by the time of my departure.

619
00:31:13,358 --> 00:31:15,258
<i>ERIC:
This chapter is called</i>

620
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:19,319
<i>''Fun and Mental
Is Fundamental. ''</i>

621
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:22,456
And there's also this
new guy, the Mutant,

622
00:31:22,567 --> 00:31:24,194
who's a little uptight.

623
00:31:24,302 --> 00:31:27,362
Sweetheart, did you spend
the whole day at the store?

624
00:31:27,472 --> 00:31:28,939
I did lots of stuff.

625
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,268
Like what?

626
00:31:30,375 --> 00:31:32,104
I built a sculpture,

627
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:34,701
I got 20,000 paddles
on a paddleball...

628
00:31:34,812 --> 00:31:37,645
and I figured out
how to win at solitaire

629
00:31:37,749 --> 00:31:39,011
every time without cheating.

630
00:31:39,117 --> 00:31:41,381
Eric, those are all things
you do by yourself.

631
00:31:41,486 --> 00:31:42,544
There were...

632
00:31:42,654 --> 00:31:44,554
people... around.

633
00:31:44,656 --> 00:31:47,386
We agreed you could come
back from camp early

634
00:31:47,492 --> 00:31:49,653
if you made an effort
to make some friends.

635
00:31:49,761 --> 00:31:52,889
It's not my fault
people don't like me.

636
00:31:52,997 --> 00:31:55,727
People love you-- once they
get the chance to know you.

637
00:31:55,833 --> 00:31:57,494
No, they don't.

638
00:31:57,602 --> 00:31:59,433
They think I'm weird.

639
00:32:00,505 --> 00:32:03,838
Because you build sculptures
by yourself.

640
00:32:03,942 --> 00:32:06,103
Because nobody wants
to play with me.

641
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:08,940
Have you asked anyone
to play with you?

642
00:32:09,047 --> 00:32:10,981
Not really.

643
00:32:11,082 --> 00:32:13,778
(laughs): Well, Eric, you have
to give people a chance.

644
00:32:13,885 --> 00:32:15,512
I know what'll happen.

645
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,451
You don't, sweetheart.

646
00:32:17,555 --> 00:32:21,389
Trust me, people are
always full of surprises.

647
00:32:21,492 --> 00:32:24,552
Just...

648
00:32:24,662 --> 00:32:26,254
just pick someone.

649
00:32:26,364 --> 00:32:28,457
Anyone. Pick someone
you don't know,

650
00:32:28,566 --> 00:32:30,466
and try to make friends with them.

651
00:32:30,568 --> 00:32:31,967
See what happens.

652
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:34,004
I don't even know how to start.

653
00:32:34,105 --> 00:32:35,163
Easy.

654
00:32:35,273 --> 00:32:37,036
Start by saying hi.

655
00:32:39,911 --> 00:32:42,880
(indistinct chatter outside)

656
00:32:49,454 --> 00:32:51,422
(toy squeaking)

657
00:32:54,959 --> 00:32:57,928
(gentle guitar intro plays)

658
00:33:02,467 --> 00:33:04,435
(piano joins in)

659
00:33:09,574 --> 00:33:11,633
# Don't be shy #

660
00:33:11,743 --> 00:33:13,472
#Just let your feelings #

661
00:33:13,578 --> 00:33:16,308
# Roll on by #

662
00:33:16,414 --> 00:33:18,348
# Don't wear fear #

663
00:33:18,449 --> 00:33:20,781
# Or nobody will know #

664
00:33:20,885 --> 00:33:23,683
#You're there #

665
00:33:23,788 --> 00:33:26,188
#Just lift your head #

666
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:28,190
#And let your feelings out #

667
00:33:28,292 --> 00:33:31,125
# Instead #

668
00:33:31,229 --> 00:33:32,958
# Now, don't be shy #

669
00:33:33,064 --> 00:33:36,056
#Just let your feelings
roll on by #

670
00:33:37,435 --> 00:33:40,199
# On by, by #

671
00:33:40,304 --> 00:33:43,034
#You know love #

672
00:33:43,141 --> 00:33:46,406
# Is better than a song #

673
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:51,308
# Love is where #

674
00:33:51,416 --> 00:33:54,044
#All of us belong #

675
00:33:55,453 --> 00:33:57,353
# So don't be shy #

676
00:33:57,455 --> 00:33:59,184
#Just let your feelings #

677
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:02,418

# Don't wear fear #

679
00:34:04,696 --> 00:34:06,061
# Or nobody #

680
00:34:06,164 --> 00:34:09,133
#Will know you're there #

681
00:34:09,233 --> 00:34:12,634
#You're there, you're there #

682
00:34:12,737 --> 00:34:16,434
#You're there,
you're there, there #

683
00:34:16,541 --> 00:34:19,009
#You're there, you're there #

684
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:20,236
#You're there #

685
00:34:20,344 --> 00:34:22,608
#You're there... #

686
00:34:30,688 --> 00:34:33,020
# No, don't be shy #

687

# On by, on by #

691
00:34:47,739 --> 00:34:49,172
# On by #

694
00:35:00,551 --> 00:35:02,519
(song ends)

695
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:09,655
(kids talking, shouting,
laughing in background)

696
00:35:16,267 --> 00:35:18,394
( crackling)

697
00:35:18,503 --> 00:35:20,198
MAGORI UM: Mahoney?

698
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,798
Mahoney baloney?

699
00:35:23,908 --> 00:35:24,806
Sir...

700
00:35:24,909 --> 00:35:26,274
I have a riddle for you.

701
00:35:26,377 --> 00:35:27,344
Maybe not now, sir.

702
00:35:27,445 --> 00:35:28,412
Don't worry. It's easy.

703
00:35:28,513 --> 00:35:31,073
What's short, amazing,
and says ''ouch''?

704
00:35:31,182 --> 00:35:32,410
I have no idea.

705
00:35:32,517 --> 00:35:33,449
Ouch!

706
00:35:33,551 --> 00:35:34,540
( chuckles)

707
00:35:34,652 --> 00:35:35,880
Very funny.

708
00:35:35,987 --> 00:35:37,818
Sir, what's wrong with this corner?

709
00:35:37,922 --> 00:35:41,255
( creaking, crackling, rumbling)

710
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:43,884
MAGORI UM:
Apparently, despite my efforts,

711
00:35:43,995 --> 00:35:45,326
the store is not taking

712
00:35:45,429 --> 00:35:48,227
- my departure very well.
- What?!

713
00:35:48,332 --> 00:35:50,061
Wait, what departure?

714
00:35:50,168 --> 00:35:52,659
It was intended to be
a spectacular surprise,

715
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:55,295
but it appears the store
has other intents.

716
00:35:55,406 --> 00:35:58,239
That's one of my favorites,
Kristine!

717
00:35:58,342 --> 00:36:00,401
Wait, what was meant as a surprise?

718
00:36:00,511 --> 00:36:02,479
( exhales)

719
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,980
I'm giving you the store.

720
00:36:05,082 --> 00:36:07,016
You're giving me the store?!

721
00:36:07,118 --> 00:36:08,312
Surprise!

722
00:36:08,419 --> 00:36:10,250
- Surprise, surprise.
- BOY: Excuse me?

723
00:36:10,354 --> 00:36:11,616
Yes, sir?

724
00:36:11,722 --> 00:36:13,485
<i>Do you have Curious George
Goes to the Hospital?</i>

725
00:36:13,591 --> 00:36:16,116
Hmm. Mahoney?

726
00:36:17,228 --> 00:36:18,252
I'll-I'll ask.

727
00:36:18,362 --> 00:36:19,351
An excellent piece

728
00:36:19,463 --> 00:36:21,454
of literature
and a fine choice indeed.

729
00:36:21,566 --> 00:36:22,931
BOY: Have you read it?

730
00:36:23,034 --> 00:36:24,160
Read it?

731
00:36:24,268 --> 00:36:27,328
I had brunch with the Man
in the Yellow Hat himself!.

732
00:36:27,438 --> 00:36:29,633
Okay, seriously, sir.

733
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:30,968
What, Mahoney?

734
00:36:31,075 --> 00:36:32,770
I can't take the Emporium.

735
00:36:32,877 --> 00:36:35,209
But you told me you needed
a new occupation.

736
00:36:35,313 --> 00:36:37,804
I meant writing music,
not running the Emporium.

737
00:36:37,915 --> 00:36:40,816
Why not? You'd do
a splendid job of it.

738
00:36:40,918 --> 00:36:41,942
Mr. Magorium...

739
00:36:42,053 --> 00:36:43,714
- Yes? Oh.
- (man clears throat)

740
00:36:43,821 --> 00:36:45,152
Oh, thank you, Bellini.

741
00:36:45,256 --> 00:36:47,622
It's for the gentleman
with the blazing red hair.

742
00:36:47,725 --> 00:36:49,556
(grumbles)

743
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,491
- Mr. Magorium...
- Yes?

744
00:36:51,596 --> 00:36:52,654
why didn't you tell me any of this?

745
00:36:52,763 --> 00:36:53,957
Well, apparently,
you misunderstand

746
00:36:54,065 --> 00:36:56,056
the rules of a surprise.

747
00:36:56,167 --> 00:36:57,828
But what if I don't want
the Emporium?

748
00:36:57,935 --> 00:36:59,926
(rumbling)

749
00:37:00,037 --> 00:37:01,197
( crackling)

750
00:37:01,305 --> 00:37:02,829
Why would you not want the Emporium?

751
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,601
Because I can't run it.

752
00:37:04,709 --> 00:37:05,607
Why not?

753
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:08,042
Because... you have to run it.

754
00:37:08,145 --> 00:37:09,203
That's not a good reason.

755
00:37:09,313 --> 00:37:12,214
It's called ''Mr. Magorium's
Wonder Emporium.''

756
00:37:12,316 --> 00:37:13,749
It rhymes!

757
00:37:13,851 --> 00:37:15,250
- Oh!
- Not to mention the fact

758
00:37:15,353 --> 00:37:18,914
that... you're magic, and I'm not.

759
00:37:19,023 --> 00:37:21,617
Besides, what are you
supposed to do

760
00:37:21,726 --> 00:37:23,694
if I'm running the Emporium?

761
00:37:25,696 --> 00:37:27,357
I'm leaving.

762
00:37:27,465 --> 00:37:28,523
You're leaving?

763
00:37:28,633 --> 00:37:31,659
(deep rumbling, creaking)

764
00:37:33,104 --> 00:37:34,696
- BOY: Excuse me?
- Yes, sir?

765
00:37:34,805 --> 00:37:36,796
There's something wrong
with this book you gave me.

766
00:37:36,908 --> 00:37:38,239
( chuckles): Wrong?

767
00:37:38,342 --> 00:37:42,073
- (distorted, overlapping voices)
- Well, this is incomprehensible.

768
00:37:42,179 --> 00:37:43,908
Hmm.

769
00:37:44,015 --> 00:37:46,745
(stammers):
The b... the book's just kidding around.

770
00:37:46,851 --> 00:37:48,819
I'll notify Bellini
immediately. Thank you.

771
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,785
Mr. Magorium!
Mr. Magorium!

772
00:37:50,888 --> 00:37:52,287
- Y-Yes, Mark?
- Follow me.

773
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:54,984
It's strangely weird
and weirdly strange.

774
00:37:55,092 --> 00:37:57,287
- What is it?
- We were finger painting,

775
00:37:57,395 --> 00:38:00,489
- Yes.
- as usual, and Katie looked up,

776
00:38:00,598 --> 00:38:01,860
and... see?

777
00:38:04,101 --> 00:38:06,899
- All the colors faded.
- We must check

778
00:38:07,004 --> 00:38:08,062
the Door of Rooms.

779
00:38:08,172 --> 00:38:11,107
- ##
- (Magorium humming)

780
00:38:20,851 --> 00:38:22,648
(animals squeaking)

781
00:38:22,753 --> 00:38:24,550
Rats!

782
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:28,858
- (girls shouting cheers)
- Cheerleaders?!

783
00:38:30,061 --> 00:38:32,928
Confound it!
Mahoney, check the Big Book.

784
00:38:39,804 --> 00:38:41,669
I would like...

785
00:38:41,772 --> 00:38:43,296
a lollipop.

786
00:38:43,407 --> 00:38:45,204
(screeches)

787
00:38:45,309 --> 00:38:47,004
(gasping)

788
00:38:47,111 --> 00:38:48,510
(screeches)

789
00:38:48,612 --> 00:38:50,273
MAHONEY: Sir.

790
00:38:50,381 --> 00:38:52,975
Mahoney, the laws of gravity
have begun to apply.

791
00:38:53,084 --> 00:38:54,847
Sir, I asked the Big Book
for a lollipop.

792
00:38:54,952 --> 00:38:56,214
I got a lemur!

793
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,447
A lemur?
We don't even carry lemurs!

794
00:38:58,556 --> 00:39:00,183
I'm not even sure
I know what a lemur is.

795
00:39:00,291 --> 00:39:01,349
Wait, is it
that primate thing

796
00:39:01,459 --> 00:39:02,585
looks kind of like a raccoon?

797
00:39:02,693 --> 00:39:03,785
Sir, we don't have time...

798
00:39:03,894 --> 00:39:05,794
Mahoney, we don't have
time to discuss lemurs!

799
00:39:05,896 --> 00:39:07,386
You're right!
Where's Eric?

800
00:39:07,498 --> 00:39:08,556
Uh...

801
00:39:08,666 --> 00:39:10,463
I should do something, too!

802
00:39:10,568 --> 00:39:14,527
- (ball squeaking)
- (grunting quietly)

803
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,669
- (metallic clunk)
- MAHONEY: Eric?

804
00:39:17,775 --> 00:39:19,970
We need you.
There's a problem.

805
00:39:24,749 --> 00:39:27,980
- ( explosions)
- Get off me! Aah!

806
00:39:28,085 --> 00:39:32,818
(grunting):
Somebody... give me a hand! Aah!

807
00:39:32,923 --> 00:39:35,892
- (lemur chittering)
- (boy screaming)

808
00:39:39,597 --> 00:39:41,565
( creaking)

809
00:39:45,936 --> 00:39:47,836
- ( chittering)
- (yelling)

810
00:39:47,938 --> 00:39:49,906
(loud sneeze)

811
00:39:52,276 --> 00:39:53,402
(yells)

812
00:39:53,511 --> 00:39:55,479
(taps key on calculator)

813
00:39:56,981 --> 00:39:58,676
- (toy engine roars)
- Whoo!

814
00:39:58,783 --> 00:40:00,011
(frantic grunting)

815
00:40:00,117 --> 00:40:01,846
- BOY: Help!
- (wind rushing)

816
00:40:01,952 --> 00:40:03,920
( creaking)

817
00:40:06,524 --> 00:40:09,118
(waves thundering)

818
00:40:10,194 --> 00:40:11,661
(yells)

819
00:40:11,762 --> 00:40:14,424
(deep creaking)

820
00:40:14,532 --> 00:40:16,261
Time to go.

821
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:21,695
(panicked shouts)

822
00:40:21,806 --> 00:40:26,072
The store is undergoing
a little difficulty right now.

823
00:40:26,177 --> 00:40:29,112
Please leave
through the front door,

824
00:40:29,213 --> 00:40:31,147
calm and orderly.

825
00:40:31,248 --> 00:40:33,512
Ew! Ew! Ew!

826
00:40:33,617 --> 00:40:36,848
And maybe try to avoid
the slimy girl.

827
00:40:36,954 --> 00:40:39,149
ROBOT: Three, two, one, liftoff!.

828
00:40:39,256 --> 00:40:40,348
Sir?

829
00:40:40,458 --> 00:40:41,789
Close the store.

830
00:40:41,892 --> 00:40:43,382
Let us all reconvene upstairs

831
00:40:43,494 --> 00:40:44,552
immediately.

832
00:40:44,662 --> 00:40:46,653
ROBOT: Lift... ah, crap.

833
00:40:49,133 --> 00:40:50,100
What's going on?

834
00:40:50,201 --> 00:40:51,395
I don't know,
but could you

835
00:40:51,502 --> 00:40:53,800
do us a favor and try
to catch the lemur?

836
00:40:53,904 --> 00:40:56,304
I don't know how to catch
a lemur. I'm a dentist.

837
00:40:56,407 --> 00:40:59,069
Well, I don't know how to catch
a lemur. I'm nine.

838
00:40:59,176 --> 00:41:01,110
WOMAN: Excuse me?

839
00:41:02,179 --> 00:41:05,774
I am very disappointed
with this book

840
00:41:05,883 --> 00:41:08,113
I just opened.

841
00:41:11,355 --> 00:41:12,879
MAHONEY: The store's shut down.

842
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:14,082
You're here?

843
00:41:14,191 --> 00:41:15,920
- Apparently.
- But not actually?

844
00:41:16,026 --> 00:41:17,254
MAGORI UM: Please sit down, Mahoney.

845
00:41:17,361 --> 00:41:19,921
We must commence
our conference contiguously.

846
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:21,520
I must apologize.

847
00:41:21,632 --> 00:41:24,965
Mortimer and I had
an appetizer spread prepared,

848
00:41:25,069 --> 00:41:27,697
but... he ate the pancakes.

849
00:41:27,805 --> 00:41:29,466
- Who's Mortimer?
- ERIC: He's the zebra.

850
00:41:29,573 --> 00:41:31,473
- What?
- The... zebra.

851
00:41:31,575 --> 00:41:32,837
- MAHONEY: Forget it, Eric.
- MAGORI UM: Order, order.

852
00:41:32,943 --> 00:41:34,274
(toy gavel squeaks)

853
00:41:34,378 --> 00:41:36,369
Now, first order of business: Eric.

854
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,378
Yes, sir?

855
00:41:37,481 --> 00:41:38,971
Ingenious hat.

856
00:41:39,083 --> 00:41:40,311
Thank you, sir.

857
00:41:40,417 --> 00:41:41,907
Second order of business.

858
00:41:42,019 --> 00:41:44,112
The store is stunningly upset,

859
00:41:44,221 --> 00:41:46,189
as indicated by its temper tantrum.

860
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:47,621
Temper tantrum?

861
00:41:47,725 --> 00:41:50,626
You didn't see it?
How could you not see it?

862
00:41:50,728 --> 00:41:52,423
- He misses a lot, sir.
- Didn't miss

863
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:53,622
the relapse notification from

864
00:41:53,731 --> 00:41:55,289
the County Zoning Commission--
got that one.

865
00:41:55,399 --> 00:41:56,889
Thankfully. Or else
you'd run the risk

866
00:41:57,001 --> 00:41:58,263
of having to submit
an SP-43 5

867
00:41:58,369 --> 00:42:00,234
and a letter of notary.

868
00:42:04,408 --> 00:42:06,501
He was in the office.

869
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:09,340
Aha, I see.
( chuckles)

870
00:42:09,446 --> 00:42:10,344
Well,

871
00:42:10,447 --> 00:42:12,039
it is my belief that the store

872
00:42:12,149 --> 00:42:13,480
has been growing
increasingly sad,

873
00:42:13,584 --> 00:42:16,144
and today threw a fit
in fear of my egress.

874
00:42:16,253 --> 00:42:18,687
You see, I've tried

875
00:42:18,789 --> 00:42:21,519
to imbue this store
with the same attitude,

876
00:42:21,625 --> 00:42:24,025
imagination and emotion

877
00:42:24,128 --> 00:42:26,722
as the children who
come to play in it,

878
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:29,560
and as such, it is prone
to the same outbursts

879
00:42:29,667 --> 00:42:32,397
as its sometimes puerile clientele.

880
00:42:32,503 --> 00:42:34,334
Like a temper tantrum.

881
00:42:34,438 --> 00:42:35,837
Precisely, Mahoney.

882
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:38,204
- Maybe it needs a time-out.
- Hmm.

883
00:42:38,309 --> 00:42:40,777
I'm sorry. How can a store
throw a temper tantrum?

884
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:45,580
Did no one explain
to the Mutant that it's

885
00:42:45,683 --> 00:42:48,208
- a magical toy store?
- I tried.

886
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:49,547
It's a magical toy store, Mutant.

887
00:42:49,653 --> 00:42:51,052
It can do all sorts of things.

888
00:42:51,155 --> 00:42:52,918
ERIC:
But it didn't start turning gray

889
00:42:53,023 --> 00:42:54,388
until Henry showed up.

890
00:42:54,491 --> 00:42:55,480
Me?

891
00:42:55,593 --> 00:42:57,356
MAGORI UM: I realize that, Eric.

892
00:42:57,461 --> 00:42:58,086
Wh-What?

893
00:42:58,195 --> 00:42:59,423
Oh, Mutant!

894
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:01,498
I'm sorry, if I'm making
your magical playland

895
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:03,499
go on the fritz,
I can just submit

896
00:43:03,601 --> 00:43:05,091
a form and get another agent.

897
00:43:05,202 --> 00:43:07,193
MAHONEY: Does your whole job
consist of submitting forms?

898
00:43:07,304 --> 00:43:08,896
No, Mahoney, sometimes
I receive them.

899
00:43:09,006 --> 00:43:10,735
- Kind of half and half.
- Order. Order, order.

900
00:43:10,841 --> 00:43:11,808
Receive some, submit some.

901
00:43:11,909 --> 00:43:13,069
- But... this underscores
- Order, order.

902
00:43:13,177 --> 00:43:15,338
the fact that I'm in no way
responsible for anything

903
00:43:15,446 --> 00:43:16,879
that may have happened
in the Emporium today.

904
00:43:16,981 --> 00:43:18,448
I was just in the office working.

905
00:43:18,549 --> 00:43:19,516
There's that ''just'' word again.

906
00:43:19,617 --> 00:43:21,050
Give it a rest for
''just'' a second, please,

907
00:43:21,151 --> 00:43:22,448
on the ''just'' word--
just the adults'll talk.

908
00:43:22,553 --> 00:43:24,248
- Okay? So it's just...
- Eee...

909
00:43:24,355 --> 00:43:25,344
nough!

910
00:43:25,456 --> 00:43:26,354
( exhales)

911
00:43:26,457 --> 00:43:27,924
Although
Mr. Weston's presence

912
00:43:28,025 --> 00:43:31,051
has coincided with the store's
dismay, it is not the cause.

913
00:43:31,161 --> 00:43:32,856
The only reason

914
00:43:32,963 --> 00:43:34,453
Mr. Weston is here

915
00:43:34,565 --> 00:43:36,760
is to determine
my legacy to Mahoney.

916
00:43:36,867 --> 00:43:39,131
- Your legacy?
- Mm-hmm.

917
00:43:39,236 --> 00:43:41,397
You mean, Mahoney gets
to run the store?

918
00:43:42,172 --> 00:43:42,968
How cool!

919
00:43:43,073 --> 00:43:45,132
What do you mean, your legacy?

920
00:43:45,242 --> 00:43:47,437
You're his heir; you're in his will.

921
00:43:47,544 --> 00:43:48,977
Why is there a will?

922
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:50,808
Why do you know there's a will?

923
00:43:50,914 --> 00:43:52,074
MAGORI UM:
I told you,

924
00:43:52,182 --> 00:43:53,547
my sweet.

925
00:43:53,651 --> 00:43:54,618
I'm leaving.

926
00:43:54,718 --> 00:43:56,151
But... I thought you meant,

927
00:43:56,253 --> 00:43:59,120
like, retirement or... vacation.

928
00:43:59,223 --> 00:44:01,623
What kind of leaving
you talking about?

929
00:44:01,725 --> 00:44:04,057
Mahoney.

930
00:44:04,161 --> 00:44:07,858
I think he means
he's going to heaven.

931
00:44:07,965 --> 00:44:12,129
- Right?
- Heaven, Elysium, Shangri-la.

932
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:14,960
I may return as a bumblebee.

933
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,940
Are you dying?

934
00:44:18,042 --> 00:44:21,034
Lightbulbs die, my sweet;
I will depart.

935
00:44:21,145 --> 00:44:22,339
- Wait...
- HENRY: Mahoney.

936
00:44:22,446 --> 00:44:23,811
Wait.

937
00:44:23,914 --> 00:44:25,347
Are you sick?

938
00:44:25,449 --> 00:44:26,279
No.

939
00:44:26,383 --> 00:44:27,543
No?

940
00:44:27,651 --> 00:44:29,676
Well, then when exactly
were you planning to depart?

941
00:44:29,787 --> 00:44:32,915
Around 4:30.

942
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:34,887
MAHONEY:
This morning he was talking gibberish.

943
00:44:34,992 --> 00:44:36,755
- MAGORI UM: Gibberish?!
- And then he grew feverish

944
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:37,884
and he collapsed.

945
00:44:37,995 --> 00:44:39,155
I did no such thing!

946
00:44:39,263 --> 00:44:40,662
Uh, for at least five minutes.

947
00:44:40,764 --> 00:44:43,699
And then when he came to,
he was... he was like this.

948
00:44:43,801 --> 00:44:45,029
- Delusional?
- Delusional?!

949
00:44:45,135 --> 00:44:46,159
I'm not delusional!

950
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:47,703
He hasn't been making any sense.

951
00:44:47,805 --> 00:44:49,272
Oh, bunkum!
Hogwash!

952
00:44:49,373 --> 00:44:50,465
Pure horseradish!

953
00:44:50,574 --> 00:44:52,474
He claims he owns
a magical toy store.

954
00:44:52,576 --> 00:44:53,770
I do. You work there.

955
00:44:53,877 --> 00:44:56,345
And that he's 2 42 years old
and an inventor.

956
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:58,711
I am not 2 42 years old!

957
00:44:58,816 --> 00:45:01,785
I'm 2 43. You were at
my birthday party.

958
00:45:01,885 --> 00:45:03,182
You brought me balloons.

959
00:45:03,287 --> 00:45:04,379
Yeah, he's delusional.

960
00:45:04,488 --> 00:45:06,217
He may have had a stroke.

961
00:45:06,323 --> 00:45:08,382
A stroke?!
You unbrookable ninny!

962
00:45:08,492 --> 00:45:11,586
The only stroke I have ever had
is one of genius!

963
00:45:11,695 --> 00:45:13,629
Okay. Nurse, can we
get him a sedative?

964
00:45:13,731 --> 00:45:15,631
Why are you lying like this?

965
00:45:15,733 --> 00:45:17,030
Because I have to.

966
00:45:17,134 --> 00:45:18,829
But your pants will catch fire.

967
00:45:18,936 --> 00:45:20,096
I don't care, sir.

968
00:45:20,204 --> 00:45:22,138
You have to live.

969
00:45:23,207 --> 00:45:25,607
(long, weary sigh)

970
00:45:26,643 --> 00:45:29,077
Darling...

971
00:45:29,179 --> 00:45:31,147
I have.

972
00:45:36,553 --> 00:45:38,783
(piano playing softly)

973
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:43,126
Hi.

974
00:45:43,227 --> 00:45:44,194
Hi.

975
00:45:44,294 --> 00:45:46,819
Uh, this is really hard.

976
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:49,694
Yeah. It is.

977
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,791
Because I got to tell you,
I'm really worried.

978
00:45:51,902 --> 00:45:52,994
Me, too.

979
00:45:53,103 --> 00:45:55,367
I can't track down
any insurance documents

980
00:45:55,472 --> 00:45:56,803
for the life of me.

981
00:45:58,776 --> 00:45:59,970
What?

982
00:46:00,077 --> 00:46:01,442
Hospital bills are astronomical
these days.

983
00:46:01,545 --> 00:46:03,240
- Mutant.
- Yeah?

984
00:46:03,347 --> 00:46:04,712
He might be dying.

985
00:46:04,815 --> 00:46:06,874
That means that we should be
even more prepared.

986
00:46:06,984 --> 00:46:09,817
Prepared? I found out
about this an hour ago.

987
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,388
You know, I'm trying to be helpful.

988
00:46:12,489 --> 00:46:14,013
Well, you're being
positively dreadful!

989
00:46:14,124 --> 00:46:15,523
- Hey, it's just that...
-Just what?

990
00:46:15,626 --> 00:46:16,593
Well, nothing.

991
00:46:16,693 --> 00:46:18,285
Maybe you should ''just'' go home.

992
00:46:18,395 --> 00:46:21,262
- I can stay...
- Mutant.

993
00:46:21,365 --> 00:46:23,731
Go home.

994
00:46:23,834 --> 00:46:25,426
All right.

995
00:46:30,007 --> 00:46:32,805
(woman speaking
over P.A. system)

996
00:46:34,077 --> 00:46:37,376
##

997
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:46,248
(over P.A.): Will any algae specialist
call extension 43 2 4 stat?

998
00:46:49,159 --> 00:46:51,150
- You know...
- Hi.

999
00:46:51,261 --> 00:46:53,627
you shouldn't be
so hard on the Mutant.

1000
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:55,789
He wants to talk about insurance.

1001
00:46:55,899 --> 00:46:57,059
I know, but...

1002
00:46:57,167 --> 00:46:59,635
it's the only thing
he knows how to talk about.

1003
00:47:05,542 --> 00:47:07,442
What are we gonna do?

1004
00:47:07,544 --> 00:47:08,943
I don't know.

1005
00:47:09,046 --> 00:47:11,776
But there's kind of another problem.

1006
00:47:11,882 --> 00:47:12,940
What?

1007
00:47:13,050 --> 00:47:14,108
Mr. Magorium...

1008
00:47:14,218 --> 00:47:15,276
Yeah?

1009
00:47:15,385 --> 00:47:18,377
He... doesn't have any pajamas.

1010
00:47:21,592 --> 00:47:23,822
The doctors can't find
anything wrong with you.

1011
00:47:23,927 --> 00:47:25,986
Of course not.
I'm perfectly healthy.

1012
00:47:26,096 --> 00:47:27,529
Then why are you leaving?

1013
00:47:27,631 --> 00:47:29,394
It's my time to go.

1014
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:30,831
That's it?

1015
00:47:30,934 --> 00:47:32,299
What else could there be?

1016
00:47:32,402 --> 00:47:34,199
What are we gonna do without you?

1017
00:47:34,304 --> 00:47:36,499
Run the store.

1018
00:47:36,607 --> 00:47:38,541
Sir, I don't know how.

1019
00:47:38,642 --> 00:47:40,473
That's why I gave you
the Congreve Cube.

1020
00:47:40,577 --> 00:47:42,067
(laughs): But it just sits there.

1021
00:47:42,179 --> 00:47:43,373
What have you done with it?

1022
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:45,345
I don't know what to do with it.

1023
00:47:45,449 --> 00:47:46,575
It's a block of wood.

1024
00:47:46,683 --> 00:47:48,150
Can you think of nothing?

1025
00:47:48,252 --> 00:47:51,517
Well, I'm sure I could think of
a million things to do with it.

1026
00:47:51,622 --> 00:47:52,680
There are a million things

1027
00:47:52,789 --> 00:47:54,518
one might do with
a block of wood,

1028
00:47:54,625 --> 00:47:57,059
but, Mahoney, what do
you think might happen

1029
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:00,027
if someone just once...

1030
00:48:01,498 --> 00:48:03,090
...believed in it?

1031
00:48:06,203 --> 00:48:08,194
Sir, I don't understand.

1032
00:48:08,305 --> 00:48:09,932
(door opens)

1033
00:48:11,141 --> 00:48:12,369
Eric!

1034
00:48:12,476 --> 00:48:14,910
What task delivers
such a wee and hale

1035
00:48:15,012 --> 00:48:16,912
stripling
to this chamber for the ill

1036
00:48:17,014 --> 00:48:19,175
and barely insured?
Hello, Doctor.

1037
00:48:19,283 --> 00:48:21,877
I brought you some stuff
I thought you might need

1038
00:48:21,985 --> 00:48:23,009
from the gift shop.

1039
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:24,109
Super!

1040
00:48:24,221 --> 00:48:25,347
Eric, would
you mind

1041
00:48:25,455 --> 00:48:26,854
keeping Mr. Magorium
company while I go

1042
00:48:26,957 --> 00:48:27,889
speak to the doctor?

1043
00:48:27,991 --> 00:48:29,083
Sure.

1044
00:48:29,192 --> 00:48:31,023
MAGORI UM:
Mahoney, why do you need the doctor?

1045
00:48:31,128 --> 00:48:31,992
Are you sick?

1046
00:48:32,095 --> 00:48:34,222
(laughter)

1047
00:48:34,331 --> 00:48:36,231
What you got, Eric?

1048
00:48:36,333 --> 00:48:37,391
Okay.

1049
00:48:37,501 --> 00:48:39,059
- Okay.
- Here we go.

1050
00:48:39,169 --> 00:48:40,193
Here we go.

1051
00:48:41,271 --> 00:48:42,738
PJs.

1052
00:48:42,839 --> 00:48:43,362
Yes!

1053
00:48:43,473 --> 00:48:45,100
A toothbrush.

1054
00:48:45,208 --> 00:48:47,836
Ah, morning becomes electric!

1055
00:48:47,945 --> 00:48:50,379
And...

1056
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:51,742
A microscope.

1057
00:48:51,848 --> 00:48:52,507
Oh...

1058
00:48:52,616 --> 00:48:54,049
A water hose.

1059
00:48:54,151 --> 00:48:54,879
( chuckles)

1060
00:48:54,985 --> 00:48:56,577
And a nozzle.

1061
00:48:56,687 --> 00:48:57,654
Ooh!

1062
00:48:58,722 --> 00:49:00,952
A plank of wood.

1063
00:49:01,058 --> 00:49:03,891
Well, plank you.
( chuckles)

1064
00:49:03,994 --> 00:49:06,189
And... this.

1065
00:49:07,230 --> 00:49:08,254
Whoa!

1066
00:49:08,365 --> 00:49:10,265
Eric, what is that?

1067
00:49:10,367 --> 00:49:11,391
It's a euphonium.

1068
00:49:11,501 --> 00:49:15,460
(laughing):
Magnificent! Hand it here.

1069
00:49:15,572 --> 00:49:17,301
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

1070
00:49:17,407 --> 00:49:20,171
If there's nothing wrong with
him, we have to discharge him.

1071
00:49:20,277 --> 00:49:22,802
We can't be responsible
for men of perfect health,

1072
00:49:22,913 --> 00:49:25,814
no matter how old or magic
they claim to be.

1073
00:49:25,916 --> 00:49:28,510
So the fact is,
you have to take him home.

1074
00:49:28,619 --> 00:49:29,711
MAHONEY: No.

1075
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:32,050
You have to understand,

1076
00:49:32,155 --> 00:49:34,555
he's decided it's his time to go.

1077
00:49:34,658 --> 00:49:36,319
Then the best thing you can do

1078
00:49:36,426 --> 00:49:38,587
is make sure
he has plenty to live for.

1079
00:49:38,695 --> 00:49:40,219
(loud honk)

1080
00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:41,354
What in God's name...?

1081
00:49:41,465 --> 00:49:43,194
(playing off-key)

1082
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:44,528
What on earth are you doing?

1083
00:49:44,635 --> 00:49:47,195
Practicing the euphonium.

1084
00:49:47,304 --> 00:49:48,202
The-the what?

1085
00:49:48,305 --> 00:49:50,000
I thought I might give a concert

1086
00:49:50,107 --> 00:49:52,200
in the psych ward tomorrow.

1087
00:49:52,309 --> 00:49:54,209
(Magorium playing euphonium)

1088
00:49:54,311 --> 00:49:56,211
There are people trying to sleep.

1089
00:49:56,313 --> 00:49:57,712
(both grunting)

1090
00:49:57,814 --> 00:50:00,374
Doesn't this hospital
need a signature

1091
00:50:00,484 --> 00:50:02,315
to remove a patient's euphonium?

1092
00:50:02,419 --> 00:50:03,977
Where the heck
did you even find this?

1093
00:50:04,087 --> 00:50:05,349
ERIC: I found it.

1094
00:50:05,455 --> 00:50:06,979
In a supply closet.

1095
00:50:07,090 --> 00:50:08,250
We don't keep
musical instruments

1096
00:50:08,358 --> 00:50:09,450
in our supply closets.

1097
00:50:09,559 --> 00:50:12,551
Well, where else
could I have found it?

1098
00:50:12,663 --> 00:50:14,528
(whistles quietly)

1099
00:50:14,631 --> 00:50:16,258
What are you doing up there?

1100
00:50:16,366 --> 00:50:18,766
Standing on a chair.

1101
00:50:18,869 --> 00:50:20,166
(whistles, chuckles quietly)

1102
00:50:20,270 --> 00:50:21,828
Okay, that's it,
both of you,

1103
00:50:21,938 --> 00:50:23,098
out of here-- come on, let's go.

1104
00:50:23,206 --> 00:50:24,503
You can come and see him tomorrow.

1105
00:50:24,608 --> 00:50:26,838
Bye.

1106
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:29,002
MAGORI UM: Good-bye, Eric.

1107
00:50:29,112 --> 00:50:31,706
Good-bye, Mahoney.

1108
00:50:31,815 --> 00:50:34,613
Don't leave before tomorrow.

1109
00:50:34,718 --> 00:50:36,777
Agreed.

1110
00:50:39,756 --> 00:50:40,916
As for you,

1111
00:50:41,024 --> 00:50:43,492
young man, you need your rest.

1112
00:50:43,593 --> 00:50:45,959
I agree.
This has been exhausting.

1113
00:50:49,366 --> 00:50:51,197
What was that boy doing
on the chair?

1114
00:50:51,301 --> 00:50:52,495
Making sure

1115
00:50:52,602 --> 00:50:55,196
I have enough space to sleep in.

1116
00:50:55,305 --> 00:50:57,170
(frustrated sigh)

1117
00:51:08,752 --> 00:51:11,312
MAHONEY:
All right, if you're supposed to help me,

1118
00:51:11,421 --> 00:51:14,151
if you're supposed
to impart some great wisdom

1119
00:51:14,257 --> 00:51:16,987
that's gonna help me
fix everything...

1120
00:51:17,094 --> 00:51:19,062
(sighs)

1121
00:51:21,098 --> 00:51:23,191
(whispers): ...please...

1122
00:51:25,402 --> 00:51:27,495
...do it now.

1123
00:51:34,344 --> 00:51:37,780
All right, I'll do it myself.

1124
00:51:40,283 --> 00:51:43,218

1125
00:51:55,432 --> 00:51:57,093

1129
00:52:21,558 --> 00:52:22,490
MAHONEY: Morning.

1130
00:52:22,592 --> 00:52:24,685
Hi. Morning.
How's he doing?

1131
00:52:24,795 --> 00:52:26,990
(door bell jingles)

1132
00:52:27,097 --> 00:52:29,964
Look, Mutant, I'm just grabbing
a few of Mr. Magorium's things,

1133
00:52:30,066 --> 00:52:31,897
and then I'm leaving for the day.

1134
00:52:32,002 --> 00:52:34,402
Yeah, yeah.Just here
to work in the office.

1135
00:52:34,504 --> 00:52:35,903
Unless...

1136
00:52:36,006 --> 00:52:37,735
you want me to work out here.

1137
00:52:37,841 --> 00:52:39,138
You can work
wherever you like, Mutant.

1138
00:52:39,242 --> 00:52:40,140
No, no, I mean,

1139
00:52:40,243 --> 00:52:41,904
in case there's, you know,

1140
00:52:42,012 --> 00:52:44,344
a toy emergency, somebody
really needs something,

1141
00:52:44,447 --> 00:52:45,709
you know, tiddlywinks.

1142
00:52:45,816 --> 00:52:46,976
I could help 'em.

1143
00:52:47,083 --> 00:52:48,516
- You could help.
- Yeah, you know,

1144
00:52:48,618 --> 00:52:50,108
in case it's little
Timmy's birthday,

1145
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:52,245
and somebody's a handful
of Legos short,

1146
00:52:52,355 --> 00:52:53,413
or whatever.

1147
00:52:53,523 --> 00:52:55,252
Do you want to run the store
for the day?

1148
00:52:55,358 --> 00:52:57,087
- Well, I'm here already...
- Mutant.

1149
00:52:57,194 --> 00:52:59,059
Okay, I-I'd like to run the store.

1150
00:52:59,162 --> 00:53:01,494
I've been waiting for two hours
on a very uncomfortable bench

1151
00:53:01,598 --> 00:53:03,463
to offer to run the store
for the day.

1152
00:53:03,567 --> 00:53:04,556
Why?

1153
00:53:04,668 --> 00:53:05,657
Because...

1154
00:53:05,769 --> 00:53:07,964
uh, because I'm a jerk.

1155
00:53:08,071 --> 00:53:11,734
I just, I felt awful because I
didn't want you to think that

1156
00:53:11,842 --> 00:53:14,936
I didn't care, and-and I do care.

1157
00:53:15,045 --> 00:53:18,071
It's just...
some people bring flowers

1158
00:53:18,181 --> 00:53:21,708
or send a card or hug people.

1159
00:53:21,818 --> 00:53:23,342
You know, I make sure

1160
00:53:23,453 --> 00:53:25,353
that people's paperwork
is all filled out properly,

1161
00:53:25,455 --> 00:53:29,551
and... so... today, I thought
I'd try something different.

1162
00:53:29,659 --> 00:53:31,217
'Cause I like you.

1163
00:53:31,328 --> 00:53:34,263
You know, I do want to help.

1164
00:53:36,967 --> 00:53:40,061
Mutant...

1165
00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:42,297
when you look at me,

1166
00:53:42,405 --> 00:53:44,566
what do you see?

1167
00:53:47,577 --> 00:53:49,568
Really pretty eyes.
( chuckles)

1168
00:53:49,679 --> 00:53:53,308
(laughs): No. I mean...

1169
00:53:53,416 --> 00:53:56,749
like, do you see a sparkle?

1170
00:53:59,122 --> 00:54:00,350
You mean, now?

1171
00:54:00,457 --> 00:54:03,221
Like, glitter on your face?

1172
00:54:03,326 --> 00:54:05,954
No, like, you know, a sparkle.

1173
00:54:06,062 --> 00:54:07,996
I... What kind of sparkle?

1174
00:54:09,699 --> 00:54:12,361
Like... something reflective

1175
00:54:12,469 --> 00:54:15,563
of something bigger
that's trying to get out.

1176
00:54:15,672 --> 00:54:17,503
You know what, never mind.

1177
00:54:17,607 --> 00:54:20,132
It might not
be so much

1178
00:54:20,243 --> 00:54:21,232
a sparkle.

1179
00:54:21,344 --> 00:54:22,811
Maybe, uh, more of a twinkle?

1180
00:54:22,913 --> 00:54:23,880
Forget it.

1181
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:24,912
Or a glint?

1182
00:54:25,015 --> 00:54:26,175
It's okay.

1183
00:54:26,283 --> 00:54:28,012
Uh, you've got the thing
that you do with your hands.

1184
00:54:28,118 --> 00:54:29,449
That's a quirk.

1185
00:54:29,552 --> 00:54:30,484
Quirk's not a sparkle?

1186
00:54:30,587 --> 00:54:31,747
Mm-mm.

1187
00:54:31,855 --> 00:54:33,413
Oh.

1188
00:54:33,523 --> 00:54:35,013
Yeah.

1189
00:54:45,335 --> 00:54:47,826
(piano playing gentle melody)

1190
00:54:47,938 --> 00:54:49,735
Good morning, Bluebell.

1191
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:52,467
- Good morning, sir.
- Look. Pants!

1192
00:54:52,575 --> 00:54:53,735
What about them?

1193
00:54:53,843 --> 00:54:56,937
Nothing.Just... pants.

1194
00:54:58,148 --> 00:54:59,547
Me, too.

1195
00:54:59,649 --> 00:55:01,879
Awesome! To the store?

1196
00:55:01,985 --> 00:55:04,112
Actually, you are coming with me.

1197
00:55:05,855 --> 00:55:07,823
I'm a little nervous about this.

1198
00:55:07,924 --> 00:55:09,118
Why?

1199
00:55:09,225 --> 00:55:11,022
Because it's mischievous
and childish.

1200
00:55:11,127 --> 00:55:13,027
I can hardly wait.
(giggles)

1201
00:55:13,129 --> 00:55:14,426
All right.

1202
00:55:15,532 --> 00:55:16,430
MAHONEY: Ready?

1203
00:55:16,533 --> 00:55:17,932
On ''go.''

1204
00:55:18,034 --> 00:55:20,662
Not on ''go.''
It's always on ''go.''

1205
00:55:20,770 --> 00:55:21,794
All right.

1206
00:55:21,905 --> 00:55:22,872
Hmm?

1207
00:55:22,973 --> 00:55:24,133
On ''triskaidekaphobia.''

1208
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,673
Oh, that's a good one!

1209
00:55:25,775 --> 00:55:27,106
- All right, ready?
- Mm-hmm.

1210
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:28,268
- Set?
- Mm-hmm.

1211
00:55:28,378 --> 00:55:30,039
Triskaidekaphobia!

1212
00:55:31,114 --> 00:55:32,775
Triskaidekaphobia!

1218
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:58,833
May I help you?

1219
00:55:59,909 --> 00:56:02,537
It's an absolute honor.

1220
00:56:03,847 --> 00:56:04,973
Now, I do have

1221
00:56:05,081 --> 00:56:06,878
a question about the hot dog buns.

1222
00:56:06,983 --> 00:56:09,543
MAGORI UM: That's the last of'em.

1223

37 seconds.

1224
00:56:12,856 --> 00:56:14,414
Great. Well done.

1225
00:56:14,524 --> 00:56:15,752
Now we wait.

1226
00:56:15,859 --> 00:56:20,023
No. We breathe.
We pulse. We regenerate.

1227
00:56:20,130 --> 00:56:22,724
Our hearts beat.
Our minds create.

1228
00:56:22,832 --> 00:56:25,357
Our souls ingest.

1229
00:56:25,468 --> 00:56:28,869
37 seconds, well used,
is a lifetime.

00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:46,450
What mystifies me is
that no one knows, Mahoney.

1235
00:56:46,556 --> 00:56:49,081
You would think that someone
in the hot dog industry

1236
00:56:49,192 --> 00:56:51,990
would have some clue
about this obvious anomaly.

1237
00:56:52,095 --> 00:56:55,030
- Here is good.
- Here is good?

1238

1239
00:56:58,568 --> 00:57:00,468
I'm very confused.

1240
00:57:00,570 --> 00:57:01,468
Now what?

1241
00:57:01,571 --> 00:57:02,799
Dance.

No, it's okay, sir.

Mahoney, why have you done all this?

1262

I wanted you to see
all the little things

1263

you're gonna miss if you leave.

00:58:10,673 --> 00:58:12,368
I see.

1265
00:58:12,475 --> 00:58:13,874
I thought

1266
00:58:13,977 --> 00:58:17,071
this was to be the best last day
of anyone who ever lived.

1267
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:18,704
Sir, this can't be your last day.

1268
00:58:18,815 --> 00:58:20,874
Ah... but it is.

1269
00:58:20,984 --> 00:58:21,814
No.

1270
00:58:21,918 --> 00:58:23,112
And now,
thanks to you,

1271
00:58:23,219 --> 00:58:24,948
it looks to be a remarkable one.

1272
00:58:25,054 --> 00:58:28,319
All I have left to do
is use a public phone

1273
00:58:28,424 --> 00:58:29,914
and my life will be complete.

1274
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:39,530
What?

1275
00:58:39,636 --> 00:58:41,536
Right here?

1276
00:58:41,638 --> 00:58:43,071
Oh, you're right.

1277
00:58:44,841 --> 00:58:46,832
You're a genius.

1278
00:58:46,943 --> 00:58:48,501
Very good with numbers.

1279
00:58:48,611 --> 00:58:49,908
You should teach.

1280
00:58:50,013 --> 00:58:52,846
- Morning.
- Hi. Yes. Morning.

1281
00:58:52,949 --> 00:58:54,644
Wow, it's quiet today.

1282
00:58:54,751 --> 00:58:56,480
Yeah, yeah.

1283
00:58:56,586 --> 00:58:57,678
No one's been in.

1284
00:58:57,787 --> 00:58:59,584
Mahoney left.
Just been me thus far.

1285
00:58:59,689 --> 00:59:01,816
You've been here
all by yourself all morning?

1286
00:59:01,925 --> 00:59:03,017
Yeah.

1287
00:59:03,126 --> 00:59:04,923
And the store didn't collapse

1288
00:59:05,028 --> 00:59:06,620
around you?

1289
00:59:12,669 --> 00:59:14,728
- Yes.
- What are you doing?

1290
00:59:14,837 --> 00:59:17,704
I am taking down merchandise codes.

1291
00:59:17,807 --> 00:59:19,900
No. With Einstein.

1292
00:59:20,009 --> 00:59:21,340
With...?

1293
00:59:21,444 --> 00:59:23,935
With Einstein?

1294
00:59:24,047 --> 00:59:25,378
Einst... Oh. ( chuckles)

1295
00:59:25,481 --> 00:59:28,177
Just, I was fiddling.

1296
00:59:28,284 --> 00:59:29,717
Occupying my time.

1297
00:59:29,819 --> 00:59:30,945
You mean, pretending?

1298
00:59:31,054 --> 00:59:33,522
Wha... No, that's not...

1299
00:59:33,623 --> 00:59:35,784
Just keeping my mind active,

1300
00:59:35,892 --> 00:59:39,055
you know, when there wasn't
much else to think about.

1301
00:59:39,162 --> 00:59:40,390
Do you know what I mean?

1302
00:59:40,496 --> 00:59:41,428
Yeah.

1303
00:59:41,531 --> 00:59:42,520
Good.

1304
00:59:42,632 --> 00:59:43,963
That's called pretending.

1305
00:59:47,103 --> 00:59:48,365
It's okay.

1306
00:59:48,471 --> 00:59:51,338
You can stay out here
and play with the toys, Mutant.

1307
00:59:51,441 --> 00:59:53,136
I won't tell anyone.

1308
00:59:56,312 --> 00:59:57,301
Here you go.

1309
00:59:57,413 --> 00:59:59,608
- (phone rings)
- Great. Let's go.

1310
01:00:01,517 --> 01:00:03,485
Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium.

1311
01:00:03,586 --> 01:00:06,384
We sell toys.
We do not fix car transmissions.

1312
01:00:06,489 --> 01:00:08,150
Eric, I am calling

1313
01:00:08,258 --> 01:00:11,159
from a public phone!

1314
01:00:11,261 --> 01:00:13,126
Good for you, sir.

1315
01:00:13,229 --> 01:00:15,891
Now, I have two things
I must tell you.

1316
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:17,990
Firstly, capital hat!

1317
01:00:19,969 --> 01:00:21,561
Thank you, sir.

1318
01:00:21,671 --> 01:00:22,933
And secondly,

1319
01:00:23,039 --> 01:00:25,507
I do wish you'd find some friends.

1320
01:00:25,608 --> 01:00:27,098
Okay?

1321
01:00:27,210 --> 01:00:28,768
Okay.

1322
01:00:28,878 --> 01:00:31,005
I love you.

1323
01:00:32,515 --> 01:00:34,278
Now, put the Mutant

1324
01:00:34,384 --> 01:00:35,510
on the phone.

1325
01:00:35,618 --> 01:00:38,519
Henry, the phone's for you.

1326
01:00:40,223 --> 01:00:41,383
Hello?

1327
01:00:41,491 --> 01:00:42,822
Mutant, I have something

1328
01:00:42,925 --> 01:00:45,018
very, very supremely important
to tell you.

1329
01:00:45,128 --> 01:00:47,119
OPERATOR:
Please deposit an additional

1330
01:00:47,230 --> 01:00:48,128
3 5 cents.

1331
01:00:48,231 --> 01:00:49,198
Hello?

1332
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:52,798
- Please deposit an additional
- Hello?

1333
01:00:52,902 --> 01:00:54,927
- 3 5 cents.
- Hello?

1334
01:00:55,038 --> 01:00:57,700
- Please deposit an additional
- Hello?

1335
01:00:57,807 --> 01:00:58,933
3 5 cents.

1336
01:00:59,042 --> 01:01:01,237
(dial tone drones)

1337
01:01:03,579 --> 01:01:04,807
(sighs)

1338
01:01:04,914 --> 01:01:07,041
Oh, well, he'll figure it out.

1339
01:01:13,923 --> 01:01:17,552
Okay, try again.

1340
01:01:17,660 --> 01:01:19,184
Come on!

1341
01:01:21,464 --> 01:01:24,297
Come on, you're being ridiculous.

1342
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:28,166
You're gonna have to do it sometime.

1343
01:01:28,271 --> 01:01:29,932
(grunts)

1344
01:01:32,175 --> 01:01:33,767
Try again.

1345
01:01:35,845 --> 01:01:36,812
(sighs)

1346
01:01:36,913 --> 01:01:38,141
What are you doing?

1347
01:01:38,247 --> 01:01:39,339
We got a nervous Slinky.

1348
01:01:39,449 --> 01:01:41,644
( chuckles)

1349
01:01:41,751 --> 01:01:42,979
We handled ourselves pretty well.

1350
01:01:43,086 --> 01:01:45,020
I think we make a good team.

1351
01:01:45,121 --> 01:01:46,486
Yeah, I think so.

1352
01:01:46,589 --> 01:01:48,887
The toys are still upset, though.

1353
01:01:48,991 --> 01:01:50,891
(quietly): Yeah.

1354
01:01:50,993 --> 01:01:53,461
- Yeah.
- Should we call it a day?

1355
01:01:54,530 --> 01:01:56,020
Yes, it looks like it.

1356
01:01:56,132 --> 01:01:57,690
Good. Checkers.

1357
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:58,789
What?

1358
01:01:58,901 --> 01:02:00,698
Checkers.

1359
01:02:00,803 --> 01:02:03,397
Uh, no, I got to get
back to the agency.

1360
01:02:03,506 --> 01:02:04,734
Come on, Henry.

1361
01:02:04,841 --> 01:02:06,399
One game.

1362
01:02:06,509 --> 01:02:08,409
Sorry. Some other time.

1363
01:02:08,511 --> 01:02:10,570
ERIC:Just one?

1364
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:13,649
(gentle, wistful theme plays)

1365
01:02:24,827 --> 01:02:27,159
(door bell jingles)

1366
01:02:27,263 --> 01:02:28,560
Henry.

1367
01:02:28,664 --> 01:02:30,427
Yes, Eric?

1368
01:02:30,533 --> 01:02:32,433
Hey, um...

1369
01:02:32,535 --> 01:02:34,093
do you mind...

1370
01:02:34,203 --> 01:02:35,363
Yes?

1371
01:02:35,471 --> 01:02:36,495
Well,

1372
01:02:36,606 --> 01:02:38,699
Mahoney usually
walks me home, and...

1373
01:02:38,808 --> 01:02:40,002
it's getting dark.

1374
01:02:40,109 --> 01:02:41,940
Do you want me to walk you home?

1375
01:02:42,044 --> 01:02:43,272
Thanks.

1376
01:02:44,847 --> 01:02:48,408
I got to ask you where
you get those hats from.

1377
01:02:48,518 --> 01:02:49,746
From my room.

1378
01:02:49,852 --> 01:02:52,821
Yeah? Every day I see you
in a different hat.

1379
01:02:52,922 --> 01:02:55,049
Yeah. I collect them.

1380
01:02:55,158 --> 01:02:57,217
You collect them, huh?

1381
01:02:57,326 --> 01:03:00,818
Mr. Magorium says I have
the neatest hat collection

1382
01:03:00,930 --> 01:03:02,090
he's ever seen.

1383
01:03:02,198 --> 01:03:04,996
I know people who,
you know, own several hats,

1384
01:03:05,101 --> 01:03:07,035
but I don't think
I've ever heard

1385
01:03:07,136 --> 01:03:10,765
of a hat collector before.

1386
01:03:12,642 --> 01:03:15,975
Do you want to see 'em?

1387
01:03:16,078 --> 01:03:18,569
Just try not to get too overwhelmed.

1388
01:03:18,681 --> 01:03:20,205
Got it.

1389
01:03:23,753 --> 01:03:26,722
##

1390
01:03:30,326 --> 01:03:33,193
Oh, my.

1391
01:03:33,296 --> 01:03:35,856
Pretty neat, huh?

1392
01:03:35,965 --> 01:03:40,095
Eric, when you said a lot,
I was expecting, like, 20.

1393
01:03:40,203 --> 01:03:42,194
Oh, no-- I have more than that.

1394
01:03:42,305 --> 01:03:43,636
You wear all these?

1395
01:03:43,739 --> 01:03:44,933
Sure.

1396
01:03:45,041 --> 01:03:46,599
What good would they be
if I didn't wear 'em?

1397
01:03:46,709 --> 01:03:47,869
Wow.

1398
01:03:50,313 --> 01:03:51,746
You want to try one on?

1399
01:03:51,848 --> 01:03:54,510
No. Thank you. I'm fine.

1400
01:03:54,617 --> 01:03:56,346
- Henry.
- Yes?

1401
01:03:56,452 --> 01:03:59,649
I think we both know
you want to try a hat on.

1402
01:03:59,755 --> 01:04:01,689
(screechy voice):
I don't know where to begin!

1403
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:04,021
I don't know where to start! Oh...!

1404
01:04:04,126 --> 01:04:08,358
We have got to buy the dragon
a toothbrush, Your Excellency.

1405
01:04:08,464 --> 01:04:10,659
After devouring most
of the township,

1406
01:04:10,766 --> 01:04:12,393
his breath is just awful!

1407
01:04:12,502 --> 01:04:15,027
(deep voice): He ate the town?!

1408
01:04:15,137 --> 01:04:16,764
He ate the baker and his wife,

1409
01:04:16,873 --> 01:04:20,036
he ate... the woodsmith
and his three sons,

1410
01:04:20,142 --> 01:04:22,167
and then for sweets--
come closer--

1411
01:04:22,278 --> 01:04:23,677
he ate the cobbler.

1412
01:04:23,779 --> 01:04:25,508
Good idea, Fool!

1413
01:04:25,615 --> 01:04:27,310
Go brush the dragon's teeth!

1414
01:04:27,416 --> 01:04:29,407
Me? He doesn't like me.

1415
01:04:29,519 --> 01:04:30,417
And...

1416
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:31,748
What do you mean, ''and''?

1417
01:04:31,854 --> 01:04:32,980
And he's quite large.

1418
01:04:33,089 --> 01:04:34,784
And...

1419
01:04:34,891 --> 01:04:37,451
I look surprisingly like...

1420
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:39,289
a toothpick from afar.

1421
01:04:39,395 --> 01:04:40,953
- (laughing)
- NANCY: Eric?

1422
01:04:41,063 --> 01:04:42,553
(knocking, door opens)

1423
01:04:42,665 --> 01:04:44,189
Do you have someone...

1424
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:45,528
(bells jingle)

1425
01:04:45,635 --> 01:04:46,727
Who's this?

1426
01:04:46,836 --> 01:04:48,235
The Mutant.

1427
01:04:48,337 --> 01:04:49,099
The what?

1428
01:04:49,205 --> 01:04:50,331
Uh, Henry.

1429
01:04:50,439 --> 01:04:52,600
Henry. Sorry. Henry.

1430
01:04:52,708 --> 01:04:54,073
Henry. Henry who?

1431
01:04:54,176 --> 01:04:56,838
Henry Weston.
I-I work at the...

1432
01:04:56,946 --> 01:04:58,937
What are you doing in my house?

1433
01:04:59,048 --> 01:05:01,744
Uh... I-I was pretending.

1434
01:05:01,851 --> 01:05:03,512
ERIC: Don't be mean to him.

1435
01:05:03,619 --> 01:05:05,086
Henry's my friend.

1436
01:05:06,989 --> 01:05:08,422
I am?

1437
01:05:09,959 --> 01:05:11,290
Yeah.

1438
01:05:11,394 --> 01:05:13,089
Cool.

1439
01:05:13,195 --> 01:05:15,254
NANCY:
A little old, don't you think,

1440
01:05:15,364 --> 01:05:16,456
to be playing dress-up?

1441
01:05:16,566 --> 01:05:18,295
Yes, yes. Absolutely.

1442
01:05:18,401 --> 01:05:19,527
Sorry. And it is late.

1443
01:05:19,635 --> 01:05:21,535
I have some work
I needed to do,

1444
01:05:21,637 --> 01:05:23,867
I should be doing,
I will be doing now.

1445
01:05:23,973 --> 01:05:25,463
- See you later.
- Don't you have chores, Eric?

1446
01:05:25,575 --> 01:05:28,601
You know, actually, he worked
all day at the store...

1447
01:05:28,711 --> 01:05:30,542
I thought you said you were leaving.

1448
01:05:30,646 --> 01:05:33,479
Certainly.
Excuse me. See ya.

1449
01:05:40,122 --> 01:05:42,090
(door bell jingles)

1450
01:06:10,753 --> 01:06:12,687
Well, Mahoney...

1451
01:06:12,788 --> 01:06:14,278
Don't go.

1452
01:06:14,390 --> 01:06:16,984
My darling.

1453
01:06:17,093 --> 01:06:18,720
I'm not ready.

1454
01:06:19,929 --> 01:06:22,659
I'm not ready for it to end.

1455
01:06:22,765 --> 01:06:25,427
I'm sorry.

1456
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:39,678
When King Lear dies in Act 5,

1457
01:06:39,782 --> 01:06:41,943
do you know what Shakespeare
has written?

1458
01:06:42,051 --> 01:06:45,987
He's written, ''He dies.''

1459
01:06:46,088 --> 01:06:48,079
That's all, nothing more.

1460
01:06:48,190 --> 01:06:52,524
No fanfare, no metaphor,
no brilliant final words.

1461
01:06:52,628 --> 01:06:55,495
The culmination
of the most influential work

1462
01:06:55,598 --> 01:06:59,762
of dramatic literature is:
''He dies.''

1463
01:07:02,204 --> 01:07:04,934
It takes Shakespeare, a genius,
to come up with ''He dies.''

1464
01:07:08,177 --> 01:07:11,305
And yet every time
I read those two words,

1465
01:07:11,414 --> 01:07:15,373
I find myself overwhelmed
with dysphoria.

1466
01:07:15,484 --> 01:07:18,146
And I know it's only
natural to be sad,

1467
01:07:18,254 --> 01:07:20,552
but not because
of the words ''He dies,''

1468
01:07:20,656 --> 01:07:24,752
but because of the life we saw
prior to the words.

1469
01:07:30,332 --> 01:07:34,200
I've lived all five
of my acts, Mahoney,

1470
01:07:34,303 --> 01:07:38,103
and I am not asking you
to be happy that I must go.

1471
01:07:38,207 --> 01:07:39,868
I'm only asking
that you

1472
01:07:39,975 --> 01:07:41,840
turn the page,

1473
01:07:41,944 --> 01:07:44,469
continue reading...

1474
01:07:44,580 --> 01:07:46,912
and let the next story begin.

1475
01:07:47,016 --> 01:07:51,680
And if anyone ever asks
what became of me,

1476
01:07:51,787 --> 01:07:53,778
you relate my life

1477
01:07:53,889 --> 01:07:55,720
in all its wonder,

1478
01:07:55,825 --> 01:08:01,764
and end it with
a simple and modest ''He died.''

1479
01:08:01,864 --> 01:08:03,593
(sobbing)

1480
01:08:03,699 --> 01:08:05,758
I love you.

1481
01:08:05,868 --> 01:08:08,063
##

1482
01:08:11,807 --> 01:08:13,672
(sighs): I love you, too.

1483
01:08:17,313 --> 01:08:19,406
(sighs heavily)

1484
01:08:22,885 --> 01:08:26,787
Your life is an occasion.

1485
01:08:26,889 --> 01:08:28,720
Rise to it.

1486
01:08:33,295 --> 01:08:34,853
(sighs quietly)

1487
01:08:56,819 --> 01:08:58,548
(door bell jingles)

1488
01:08:58,654 --> 01:09:01,350

1489

1490
01:09:14,937 --> 01:09:16,962
(hinges squeak)

1491
01:09:22,878 --> 01:09:25,847
(noble gentle theme swells,
plays grandly)

1492
01:09:48,103 --> 01:09:50,071
##

1493
01:10:00,583 --> 01:10:02,551
(theme quiets)

1494
01:10:09,325 --> 01:10:11,623
Good-bye, my love.

1495
01:10:21,270 --> 01:10:23,238
##

1496
01:10:27,810 --> 01:10:28,742

theme playing)

1501
01:11:23,432 --> 01:11:25,400
##

1502
01:11:32,574 --> 01:11:35,543
- (bell dings)
- (store groans sadly)

1503
01:11:41,250 --> 01:11:44,219
I-It's... not that bad.

1504
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:47,346
We can bring it back.

1505
01:11:47,456 --> 01:11:48,753
Right, Mahoney?

1506
01:11:48,857 --> 01:11:51,325
Mahoney?

1507
01:11:51,427 --> 01:11:53,156
Let's just run the store and...

1508
01:11:53,262 --> 01:11:54,456
see if it picks up.

1509
01:11:54,563 --> 01:11:56,895
- I'm sorry, Eric.
- I'll help you.

1510
01:11:56,999 --> 01:11:58,330
Just don't leave.

1511
01:11:58,434 --> 01:12:00,766
- Eric...
- Mahoney, don't leave.

1512
01:12:00,869 --> 01:12:02,302
I'm sorry.

1513
01:12:02,404 --> 01:12:04,895
It just needs a little magic.

1514
01:12:05,007 --> 01:12:07,066
I know.

1515
01:12:07,176 --> 01:12:09,201
I don't have any.

1516
01:12:09,311 --> 01:12:12,280
(low rumbling, deep creaking)

1517
01:12:13,882 --> 01:12:15,747
(door bell jingles)

1518
01:12:30,566 --> 01:12:32,534
##

1519
01:12:52,888 --> 01:12:54,856
##

1520
01:12:58,427 --> 01:13:00,622
<i>ERIC:
This chapter is called</i>

1521
01:13:00,729 --> 01:13:02,754
<i>''A New Beginning. ''</i>

1522
01:13:11,106 --> 01:13:13,836
(indistinct conversation in distance)

1523
01:13:21,583 --> 01:13:25,883
(piano playing soft rock song)

1524
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:39,458
Eric?

1525
01:13:39,568 --> 01:13:40,865
What are you doing?

1526
01:13:40,969 --> 01:13:43,028
I'm playing ''JenniferJuniper.''

1527
01:13:43,138 --> 01:13:44,196
Why?

1528
01:13:44,306 --> 01:13:46,331
Because someone requested it.

1529
01:13:46,442 --> 01:13:48,273
No, why are you here?

1530
01:13:48,377 --> 01:13:50,470
Because I have to make money, Eric.

1531
01:13:50,579 --> 01:13:51,841
Then run the store.

1532
01:13:51,947 --> 01:13:53,471
I can't.

1533
01:13:53,582 --> 01:13:54,776
Look.

1534
01:13:54,883 --> 01:13:57,181
I would love to run the store,
but I can't.

1535
01:13:57,286 --> 01:13:58,344
I'm not Mr. Magorium.

1536
01:13:58,454 --> 01:13:59,978
Is that why it's for sale?

1537
01:14:00,089 --> 01:14:01,283
Yeah.

1538
01:14:01,390 --> 01:14:02,550
Look, I'm sorry.

1539
01:14:02,658 --> 01:14:04,853
I didn't mean to let you down.

1540
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:05,949
Is this what you want?

1541
01:14:06,061 --> 01:14:07,551
No...

1542
01:14:07,663 --> 01:14:10,530
No, but I don't know
how to do anything else.

1543
01:14:10,632 --> 01:14:12,031
Stop saying that.

1544
01:14:12,134 --> 01:14:15,228
Eric, I understand
this is hard for you.

1545
01:14:15,337 --> 01:14:17,897
This is really hard for me, too.

1546
01:14:19,475 --> 01:14:22,239
But I cannot be a kid anymore.

1547
01:14:22,344 --> 01:14:24,972
That's why Mr. Magorium
gave you the store.

1548
01:14:37,389 --> 01:14:39,516
(door bell jingles)

1549
01:14:39,624 --> 01:14:41,956
(distant siren wails)

1550
01:14:44,929 --> 01:14:46,521
My Lord...

1551
01:14:46,631 --> 01:14:48,360
no wonder you're
going out of business.

1552
01:14:48,466 --> 01:14:49,592
It's... depressing.

1553
01:14:49,701 --> 01:14:50,827
BOY:
Can I play over there?

1554
01:14:50,935 --> 01:14:51,959
- Sure.
- What? No...

1555
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:53,128
Jack, please don't touch anything.

1556
01:14:53,238 --> 01:14:55,672
Actually, ma'am, it's okay.

1557
01:14:55,774 --> 01:14:57,332
He can play with anything he likes.

1558
01:14:57,442 --> 01:15:00,172
Let me show you the
spiral staircases here.

1559
01:15:00,278 --> 01:15:01,609
Do you know how it works?

1560
01:15:01,713 --> 01:15:03,704
(man speaking indistinctly)

1561
01:15:03,815 --> 01:15:05,112
Okay, I'll show you.

1562
01:15:07,319 --> 01:15:09,116
Cool. That's neat.

1563
01:15:09,220 --> 01:15:11,484
Yeah...
It's a magnet.

1564
01:15:11,589 --> 01:15:13,147
How does a magnet work?

1565
01:15:13,258 --> 01:15:14,725
I don't know.

1566
01:15:14,826 --> 01:15:15,986
It's, uh...

1567
01:15:16,094 --> 01:15:18,255
Is it magic?

1568
01:15:21,733 --> 01:15:23,724
Well...

1569
01:15:23,835 --> 01:15:27,327
I believe it is.

1570
01:15:30,241 --> 01:15:31,902
MAN:
...leads to the apartments upstairs.

1571
01:15:32,010 --> 01:15:33,705
They're an excellent
source of income.

1572
01:15:33,812 --> 01:15:35,973
Those planets and the rocket...

1573
01:15:36,081 --> 01:15:37,480
I have to say--

1574
01:15:37,582 --> 01:15:39,948
the use of this space is
completely impractical.

1575
01:15:40,051 --> 01:15:42,076
It...

1576
01:15:42,187 --> 01:15:44,417
it wasn't built for practicality.

1577
01:15:44,522 --> 01:15:46,114
Oh.

1578
01:15:46,224 --> 01:15:49,387
Well, it certainly is a large
enough space for the price.

1579
01:15:49,494 --> 01:15:51,291
Are the fixtures included?

1580
01:15:51,396 --> 01:15:55,059
Yeah-- the cash register...

1581
01:15:55,166 --> 01:15:58,226
the slide, the tree,
the planets,

1582
01:15:58,336 --> 01:16:01,999
the rocket ship,
the Door of Rooms...

1583
01:16:02,107 --> 01:16:03,369
( chuckles): Okay!

1584
01:16:03,475 --> 01:16:04,942
Great.

1585
01:16:05,043 --> 01:16:06,738
Well, I'll let you know.

1586
01:16:06,845 --> 01:16:08,779
Okay,Jack, honey?

1587
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:10,711
- Come on, we're leaving.
- Mom, you gotta see this!

1588
01:16:10,815 --> 01:16:13,045
You know what?
I don't have time for this.

1589
01:16:13,151 --> 01:16:15,449
Mommy's got a lot of
other properties to see.

1590
01:16:15,553 --> 01:16:17,544
Rub that in.
Okay.

1591
01:16:17,655 --> 01:16:19,020
We'll be in touch.

1592
01:16:19,124 --> 01:16:21,388
JACK: Mommy, it's magic!

1593
01:16:24,195 --> 01:16:26,060
(door bell jingles)

1594
01:16:31,136 --> 01:16:33,798
(magical chiming)

1595
01:16:44,816 --> 01:16:47,751
- (indistinct conversations)
- (phone ringing)

1596
01:16:47,852 --> 01:16:49,114
Eric?

1597
01:16:49,220 --> 01:16:51,984
I'm here to make you a
substantial offer for the store.

1598
01:16:52,090 --> 01:16:53,580
What?

1599
01:16:53,691 --> 01:16:57,149
Although I am unable to offer
the full amount and I'm nine,

1600
01:16:57,262 --> 01:17:00,026
I think you may be interested
in my proposal.

1601
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:03,658
The following simply states

1602
01:17:03,768 --> 01:17:07,295
that I can offer Mahoney
a down payment

1603
01:17:07,405 --> 01:17:10,135
of $237 in pennies,

1604
01:17:10,241 --> 01:17:13,176
nickels, dimes and a Christmas
check from my grandma.

1605
01:17:13,278 --> 01:17:16,304
And then I am willing
to pay you

1606
01:17:16,414 --> 01:17:17,938
my allowance
and a hefty percentage

1607
01:17:18,049 --> 01:17:20,609
of the store's profit
on a weekly basis.

1608
01:17:20,718 --> 01:17:22,652
Keep in mind that my age
works as a benefit,

1609
01:17:22,754 --> 01:17:25,279
as it means that I have
more weeks left

1610
01:17:25,390 --> 01:17:27,517
in my life than
the typical buyer,

1611
01:17:27,625 --> 01:17:29,559
which means more allowances.

1612
01:17:29,661 --> 01:17:30,855
Why are you doing this?

1613
01:17:30,962 --> 01:17:32,520
I...

1614
01:17:32,630 --> 01:17:34,325
want to get into
the real estate game.

1615
01:17:34,432 --> 01:17:36,457
Flip a few properties,

1616
01:17:36,568 --> 01:17:38,331
make my mark on the city.

1617
01:17:38,436 --> 01:17:39,801
Eric...

1618
01:17:39,904 --> 01:17:41,769
The only thing we can invest in

1619
01:17:41,873 --> 01:17:43,170
- is the future.
- Buddy...

1620
01:17:43,274 --> 01:17:44,206
- I want to...
- Eric.

1621
01:17:44,309 --> 01:17:47,107
Stop.

1622
01:17:47,212 --> 01:17:49,180
(sighs)

1623
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:52,147
I don't want someone else
to have the store, all right?

1624
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:54,343
I don't want it to change.

1625
01:17:54,452 --> 01:17:56,010
Okay. All right.

1626
01:17:56,120 --> 01:17:57,985
I'll throw in my hat collection.

1627
01:17:58,089 --> 01:17:59,681
Don't throw in your hat collection.

1628
01:17:59,791 --> 01:18:01,315
But there has to be something.

1629
01:18:01,426 --> 01:18:04,020
Please.

1630
01:18:04,128 --> 01:18:07,529
She's about to make
a terrible mistake, Mutant.

1631
01:18:07,632 --> 01:18:11,363
We can't let her do that.

1632
01:18:11,469 --> 01:18:13,835
As my friend...

1633
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:20,608
...help me... please.

1634
01:18:25,283 --> 01:18:27,251
(knocking)

1635
01:18:29,153 --> 01:18:31,121
(knocking)

1636
01:18:33,157 --> 01:18:34,215
(sighs)

1637
01:18:50,975 --> 01:18:53,535
- Hi.
- Hello.

1638
01:18:55,313 --> 01:18:56,780
Wow.

1639
01:18:56,881 --> 01:18:58,906
What happened in here?

1640
01:18:59,017 --> 01:19:03,078
I don't think you'd understand.

1641
01:19:03,187 --> 01:19:05,849
Well, I've got news.

1642
01:19:05,957 --> 01:19:07,322
Yeah?

1643
01:19:07,425 --> 01:19:09,256
You've got an offer on the store.

1644
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:12,955
It's a good offer.
Cash offer.

1645
01:19:13,064 --> 01:19:15,589
From the lady earlier today.

1646
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:17,827
Wow.

1647
01:19:17,936 --> 01:19:19,062
I know it's late,

1648
01:19:19,170 --> 01:19:20,296
but the woman's very aggressive.

1649
01:19:20,405 --> 01:19:22,202
I thought you should
look it over tonight

1650
01:19:22,307 --> 01:19:24,366
and come up with a decision
by tomorrow morning.

1651
01:19:24,475 --> 01:19:26,443
Okay.

1652
01:19:26,544 --> 01:19:29,138
( exhales deeply)

1653
01:19:29,247 --> 01:19:30,646
Do you think I should take it?

1654
01:19:30,748 --> 01:19:32,875
Well...

1655
01:19:32,984 --> 01:19:34,747
Do you think I should take it?

1656
01:19:34,852 --> 01:19:38,015
In my professional opinion,

1657
01:19:38,122 --> 01:19:40,215
it is a very unique offer

1658
01:19:40,325 --> 01:19:42,520
and it's a lot more
than we expected.

1659
01:19:42,627 --> 01:19:44,356
I-I... I think
you'd be a fool

1660
01:19:44,462 --> 01:19:47,226
not to take it.

1661
01:19:49,067 --> 01:19:52,628
But I am not here as a professional.

1662
01:19:54,706 --> 01:19:57,004
I'm here as your friend.

1663
01:19:57,108 --> 01:19:59,269
And I think
you should keep the store.

1664
01:19:59,377 --> 01:20:01,140
You don't even believe
in this store.

1665
01:20:01,245 --> 01:20:02,906
- No, but...
- I... I can't.

1666
01:20:03,014 --> 01:20:06,313
I want to, but I just can't.

1667
01:20:06,417 --> 01:20:07,782
You ''just'' can't.

1668
01:20:07,885 --> 01:20:11,685
Yeah. I guess not.

1669
01:20:11,789 --> 01:20:13,620
What do you got there?

1670
01:20:13,725 --> 01:20:15,283
Oh, it's the Congreve Cube.

1671
01:20:15,393 --> 01:20:19,329
It's supposed to help me unlock
some great mystery or something.

1672
01:20:19,430 --> 01:20:22,524
- Looks like a block of wood.
- It is.

1673
01:20:22,634 --> 01:20:24,966
Are you supposed to unlock
a mystery with a block of wood?

1674
01:20:25,069 --> 01:20:26,661
It's a magical
block of wood, Mutant.

1675
01:20:26,771 --> 01:20:29,069
It's a block of wood that
probably, in the right hands,

1676
01:20:29,173 --> 01:20:31,733
would reveal some greatness that...

1677
01:20:31,843 --> 01:20:33,606
we can't even imagine.

1678
01:20:33,711 --> 01:20:35,201
That's impossible.

1679
01:20:35,313 --> 01:20:37,508
This is what you don't understand.

1680
01:20:37,615 --> 01:20:39,105
What you have somehow missed.

1681
01:20:39,217 --> 01:20:40,650
Every minute

1682
01:20:40,752 --> 01:20:43,585
of every day in every corner
of this store,

1683
01:20:43,688 --> 01:20:45,588
what happened was the impossible.

1684
01:20:45,690 --> 01:20:47,180
Do you honestly
believe all that stuff?

1685
01:20:47,291 --> 01:20:48,815
- Yes!
- That this store was magic?

1686
01:20:48,926 --> 01:20:50,257
You never saw it.

1687
01:20:50,361 --> 01:20:52,022
That that block of wood is more
than just a block of wood?

1688
01:20:52,130 --> 01:20:53,097
Absolutely.

1689
01:20:53,197 --> 01:20:55,188
I believe it with my entire heart.

1690
01:20:55,299 --> 01:20:57,824
- ( cube clatters)
- But the disheartening truth

1691
01:20:57,935 --> 01:21:00,267
is that only Mr. Magorium
could make it so.

1692
01:21:00,371 --> 01:21:02,999
- Um...
- It was his Emporium, not mine.

1693
01:21:03,107 --> 01:21:04,768
-J-Just, uh...
- Look, I appreciate

1694
01:21:04,876 --> 01:21:08,277
-you coming here, but it's over.
- Say that thing

1695
01:21:08,379 --> 01:21:10,472
about that block of wood
that's not magic.

1696
01:21:10,581 --> 01:21:12,310
It is magic.

1697
01:21:12,417 --> 01:21:15,113
- What is wrong with you, Mutant?
- Say it one more time,

1698
01:21:15,219 --> 01:21:16,811
that that's more
than just a block of wood.

1699
01:21:16,921 --> 01:21:21,017
It is absolutely more
than just a block of woo...

1700
01:21:21,125 --> 01:21:23,025
Well, it moves, for one thing.

1701
01:21:25,430 --> 01:21:27,489
Move.

1702
01:21:27,598 --> 01:21:29,463
(scoffs)

1703
01:21:29,567 --> 01:21:32,001
Come on, you can
do better than that.

1704
01:21:32,103 --> 01:21:33,263
Move!

1705
01:21:36,340 --> 01:21:37,967
All right.
Don't worry.

1706
01:21:38,076 --> 01:21:41,239
If you fall, I'll just
pick you right back up.

1707
01:21:41,345 --> 01:21:42,505
Move.

1708
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:51,983
(whooshing)

1709
01:21:58,229 --> 01:21:59,753
(whooshing)

1710
01:22:08,272 --> 01:22:11,435
(whooshing)

1711
01:22:11,542 --> 01:22:13,237
(gasps)

1712
01:22:19,717 --> 01:22:23,483
(whooshing)

1713
01:22:33,297 --> 01:22:35,197
No way.

1714
01:22:35,299 --> 01:22:36,664
(thud)

1715
01:22:39,971 --> 01:22:41,768
<i>ERIC:

1716
01:22:41,873 --> 01:22:44,307
<i>''You Have to Believe It to See It...</i>

1717
01:22:44,408 --> 01:22:46,933
<i>Or Messing with the Mutant. ''</i>

1718
01:22:51,582 --> 01:22:53,516
MAHONEY (softly): Mutant.

1719
01:22:53,618 --> 01:22:55,142
Mutant.

1720
01:22:55,253 --> 01:22:56,652
You gotta wake up, Sleeping Beauty.

1721
01:22:56,754 --> 01:22:58,847
There are people here.

1722
01:22:58,956 --> 01:23:00,651
Mm... What?

1723
01:23:00,758 --> 01:23:04,091
Wakey, wakey, eggs and bakey.

1724
01:23:04,195 --> 01:23:05,423
Hi.

1725
01:23:05,530 --> 01:23:06,792
( clears throat): Morning.

1726
01:23:06,898 --> 01:23:08,160
I'm sorry
to wake you up,

1727
01:23:08,266 --> 01:23:09,528
but you've slept long enough.

1728
01:23:09,634 --> 01:23:11,101
- (groans)
- What's wrong with your head?

1729
01:23:11,202 --> 01:23:12,726
It hurts.
I hit it pretty hard.

1730
01:23:12,837 --> 01:23:13,929
You did?

1731
01:23:14,038 --> 01:23:15,562
Yeah, it must've been
when I passed out.

1732
01:23:15,673 --> 01:23:17,038
What do you mean?

1733
01:23:17,141 --> 01:23:18,972
When I keeled over.

1734
01:23:19,076 --> 01:23:20,338
I didn't see that.

1735
01:23:20,444 --> 01:23:21,968
Yes, you did.
Last night.

1736
01:23:22,079 --> 01:23:23,637
Last night?
I went home.

1737
01:23:23,748 --> 01:23:25,909
No, no, before...

1738
01:23:26,017 --> 01:23:27,780
I passed out.

1739
01:23:27,885 --> 01:23:30,183
I think you must be confused.

1740
01:23:30,288 --> 01:23:31,482
No, no.

1741
01:23:31,589 --> 01:23:33,489
I passed out.
I remember.

1742
01:23:33,591 --> 01:23:34,922
It was after the cube flew.

1743
01:23:35,026 --> 01:23:37,426
- What cube?
- ''What cube?''

1744
01:23:41,199 --> 01:23:43,292
Mahoney.
The Congreve Cube.

1745
01:23:43,401 --> 01:23:45,528
You made it fly all around the room.

1746
01:23:45,636 --> 01:23:47,365
I think you must
have dreamt all that.

1747
01:23:47,471 --> 01:23:49,803
I left you here to finalize
the real estate paperwork.

1748
01:23:49,907 --> 01:23:51,670
- Maybe you got sleepy.
- No, no, no, no.

1749
01:23:51,776 --> 01:23:53,505
I-I-I didn't.
Positively not.

1750
01:23:53,611 --> 01:23:56,045
I passed out
after you made that cube fly.

1751
01:23:56,147 --> 01:23:57,546
It doesn't matter.

1752
01:23:57,648 --> 01:24:00,082
- I'm selling the store.
- What?

1753
01:24:00,184 --> 01:24:01,947
Yeah, remember the offer?

1754
01:24:02,053 --> 01:24:03,543
We're signing the deal this morning.

1755
01:24:03,654 --> 01:24:04,780
No, no. Hey, hey.
You can't.

1756
01:24:04,889 --> 01:24:05,913
Why can't I?

1757
01:24:06,023 --> 01:24:08,184
Because this, it's...
it's magic!

1758
01:24:08,292 --> 01:24:09,520
You really think
this store is magic?

1759
01:24:09,627 --> 01:24:11,151
Yes. Yes, I do.

1760
01:24:11,262 --> 01:24:13,662
Isn't that just a little
difficult to believe?

1761
01:24:13,764 --> 01:24:15,664
No, no, I don't...
I don't think so.

1762
01:24:15,766 --> 01:24:16,698
No, not at all.

1763
01:24:16,801 --> 01:24:18,234
Now...

1764
01:24:18,336 --> 01:24:22,363
I believe that you can make it
be anything that you want.

1765
01:24:23,708 --> 01:24:25,107
It's you.

1766
01:24:25,209 --> 01:24:26,938
You...

1767
01:24:27,044 --> 01:24:28,272
are a block of wood.

1768
01:24:28,379 --> 01:24:30,279
I'm a block of wood?

1769
01:24:30,381 --> 01:24:31,871
Yeah, Mahoney. It's you.

1770
01:24:31,983 --> 01:24:34,781
And what you need to
believe in is not the cube,

1771
01:24:34,886 --> 01:24:37,855
and it's not the store,
and it's not me.

1772
01:24:37,955 --> 01:24:40,947
What you need to believe in is you.

1773
01:24:44,528 --> 01:24:47,258
Holy cow.

1774
01:24:47,365 --> 01:24:49,629
What is it?

1775
01:24:49,734 --> 01:24:51,895
A sparkle.

# In the dark times
and the hard questions #

1821

in your mind #
