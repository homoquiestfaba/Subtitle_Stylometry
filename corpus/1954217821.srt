1
00:00:02,295 --> 00:00:05,995
And he said to me, "Son of man,
dug in the wall, and I dug in the wall,

2
00:00:06,145 --> 00:00:09,323
and now - in the wall of the door. "
(The Book of the Prophet Iezikilya, 8.7)

3
00:00:18,396 --> 00:00:20,779
As it was,
from the beginning ...

4
00:00:23,807 --> 00:00:27,042
Fell in love with a girl that
known since childhood.

5
00:00:30,726 --> 00:00:34,349
Ordinary Story. As thousands
other at the time.

6
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,915
How could this happen?

7
00:00:40,318 --> 00:00:43,068
Love died in an insane hatred.

8
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:54,381
<b> Vukovar, the usual story </ b>

9
00:01:44,657 --> 00:01:49,652
Two-family house repaired, thought
a good future days ...

10
00:01:50,313 --> 00:01:52,082
... If it depended on us ...

11
00:02:25,002 --> 00:02:28,418
- The Berlin Wall had fallen.
- This is a good sign.

12
00:02:28,734 --> 00:02:31,474
- The Berlin Wall fell, Mom.
- Thank God!

13
00:02:33,158 --> 00:02:34,231
Finally.

14
00:03:10,183 --> 00:03:13,889
I melt from your kisses.

15
00:03:15,473 --> 00:03:20,156
End of the millennium, the end
of utopia, Berlin Wall fell,

16
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:28,701
Leningrad again, St. Petersburg, Europe
wants reunion new hope fills the world...

17
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:41,749
Done!

18
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:56,765
- Hooray! - Hooray!
- Cheers! ...

19
00:04:06,493 --> 00:04:09,594
When you are happy, the sun
warm warmer.

20
00:04:12,383 --> 00:04:14,606
This is a new dress from Sweden?

21
00:04:20,001 --> 00:04:24,326
Bruno's back?
Miss.

22
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,921
- Hooray! - Hooray!

23
00:04:26,115 --> 00:04:29,180
All good
but home is better, right?

24
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:36,358
When flying home, looked down
under the wing of the aircraft,

25
00:04:37,347 --> 00:04:41,251
Page of history, or of the land.

26
00:04:45,588 --> 00:04:49,125
Let the new house
fulfilled all the wishes!

27
00:04:50,299 --> 00:04:51,579
And a lot of kids!

28
00:04:53,144 --> 00:04:58,211
"In our new house
the sun shines ... "

29
00:06:27,118 --> 00:06:31,125
"Croatia, Croatia!"

30
00:06:31,116 --> 00:06:35,737
- I'm hot, Tomo
- We're almost there.

31
00:06:38,652 --> 00:06:43,797
"Yugoslavia, Yugoslavia!"

32
00:06:48,105 --> 00:06:50,464
- Open the door!
- Ana!

33
00:06:54,692 --> 00:06:57,536
Wedding, and demonstrations around ..

34
00:07:01,894 --> 00:07:04,675
"Serbia, Serbia!"

35
00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:07,140
All boils Belgrade.

36
00:07:09,655 --> 00:07:16,748
Look at what is in Zagreb!
"Croatia, Croatia!"

37
00:07:16,868 --> 00:07:18,773
Now wait and let's go.

38
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:24,924
And the same thing here.

39
00:07:39,462 --> 00:07:41,020
Laura, the music!

40
00:08:31,008 --> 00:08:38,486
Wait! What silence.
See how quiet flows the Danube.

41
00:08:46,556 --> 00:08:55,178
There is nothing. Red or blue
strong or weak. Smart or stupid.

42
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,158
Now everything is just Croats or Serbs.

43
00:09:00,008 --> 00:09:01,854
- Over the top, Ana!
- Do not overdo it.

44
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:05,215
Taught us that one history and geography,

45
00:09:06,711 --> 00:09:08,952
brought us that we are one.

46
00:09:10,712 --> 00:09:15,759
But our generation does not think,
Who are we, the Serbs and Croats,

47
00:09:16,654 --> 00:09:18,398
Orthodox or Catholics ...

48
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:24,176
Two celebrated Christmas, two New Year
two Easter ..

49
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,426
Married to each other ..

50
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:36,139
Had children.

51
00:09:42,891 --> 00:09:43,859
I love you!

52
00:10:17,087 --> 00:10:19,322
For the first time we part for so long.

53
00:10:26,597 --> 00:10:28,847
The army will not hold me long.

54
00:10:33,005 --> 00:10:33,799
Do not worry!

55
00:10:38,855 --> 00:10:40,156
See what happens?

56
00:10:40,788 --> 00:10:44,035
Europe will not allow the country to
disintegrate.

57
00:10:44,445 --> 00:10:45,693
Pusni Nashat Ploce!

58
00:12:46,209 --> 00:12:47,455
Late!

59
00:12:52,873 --> 00:12:53,777
Beware!

60
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,013
Rain came ...

61
00:13:02,286 --> 00:13:07,177
Mom, why are you here? I'm leaving the
army; not the end of the world.

62
00:13:17,878 --> 00:13:18,611
Good luck!

63
00:13:21,005 --> 00:13:22,059
Good luck to you!

64
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,402
"Serbia - Get out!"

65
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,558
Daddy, look!

66
00:14:08,204 --> 00:14:12,557
Crap at home.
shitting on the Constitution.

67
00:14:12,883 --> 00:14:17,099
In our own country
we are second class citizens.

68
00:14:17,305 --> 00:14:18,814
I will not allow it!

69
00:14:22,618 --> 00:14:24,467
Go, my son, go late!

70
00:14:24,926 --> 00:14:26,449
Do not worry, we will not be gone.

71
00:15:02,456 --> 00:15:08,753
What's up, people .. ..
Who's that?

72
00:15:15,482 --> 00:15:21,413
How quickly things change.
throughout the city.

73
00:15:22,569 --> 00:15:24,796
Suddenly my former friends
changed.

74
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:29,926
Many are leaving. But Vukovar
still my city.

75
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:40,638
I remember the day when Tom drew beside
me and lifted his face, all in the paint.

76
00:15:41,431 --> 00:15:47,065
To love? Now the holiday
color is not what it was ..

77
00:15:48,691 --> 00:15:53,935
Got to go to Sweden. More there is
nothing to wait for. We'll go together.

78
00:15:54,714 --> 00:15:56,269
I've been wanting.

79
00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:19,065
Children, what are you doing? - Colima it
because it is not ours, that's what.

80
00:16:19,462 --> 00:16:22,263
- It's your baby?
- No. - I know whose.

81
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,589
Bring him to the doctor.

82
00:16:25,614 --> 00:16:26,982
Passport, please!

83
00:16:35,005 --> 00:16:37,254
- Where do you work?
- In Sweden.

84
00:16:38,877 --> 00:16:44,126
- I know you ... Were
military training? - Yes, yes.

85
00:16:45,392 --> 00:16:46,107
Thank you.

86
00:16:48,887 --> 00:16:49,873
Now what ...

87
00:17:04,895 --> 00:17:11,058
Trait that is going on in the country and
elsewhere, the absurdity of absurdity ...

88
00:17:11,514 --> 00:17:14,974
The outer limits of cracking at the seams,
and on the interior building walls.

89
00:17:15,687 --> 00:17:21,449
Along with the regular army, which all of
us are created and paramilitary formations.

90
00:17:30,888 --> 00:17:32,321
Kostevski! - J.

91
00:17:36,465 --> 00:17:38,199
Vorants! - Thank you.

92
00:17:39,301 --> 00:17:40,775
Fadil! - J.

93
00:17:53,853 --> 00:17:59,533
Bosnian pizza. Yum.
What they say about Montenegro?

94
00:18:03,004 --> 00:18:07,336
Dalmatians, try, can
for you it's the last one!

95
00:18:08,015 --> 00:18:11,964
Eat bananas from Honduras,
Montenegrin plum far now.

96
00:18:12,722 --> 00:18:14,324
The longer, the better.

97
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,041
Something I do not like
what you're talking.

98
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,126
Here are bastards.

99
00:18:42,357 --> 00:18:44,859
It's okay.
The main thing is still alive ...

100
00:18:47,713 --> 00:18:49,360
Ana, Ana ..

101
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:51,174
Ana!

102
00:18:54,415 --> 00:18:56,426
There all the back is broken.

103
00:18:57,681 --> 00:19:00,229
Whatever you do - all black.

104
00:19:03,881 --> 00:19:05,887
There is no death, there is movement.

105
00:19:06,753 --> 00:19:10,251
I'm not going anywhere. Sons
will be on the doorstep.

106
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,515
Tomorrow and our home
going into the air.

107
00:19:15,134 --> 00:19:19,230
You, my dear, you will go with us!
She would not go anywhere!

108
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:25,346
Leave alone.
Here we are among their

109
00:19:26,274 --> 00:19:29,520
Croatia - a country where
there is a place for everyone.

110
00:19:29,664 --> 00:19:33,028
Again, it starts in the same
1941st we also referred to as "brothers."

111
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:35,819
This is not the Croats, and freaks.

112
00:19:35,835 --> 00:19:40,234
Horror around, friends.
All of fear.

113
00:19:40,003 --> 00:19:41,493
Many of them have left.

114
00:19:41,687 --> 00:19:46,707
Listen to me, all too
bloated. All the better.

115
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:49,935
I do not want to tempt fate,
my father during the last war.

116
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:55,845
It seems to me that those killed in
Jasenovac again float in water.

117
00:19:56,208 --> 00:20:00,527
Every night, all the shooting, and in the
afternoon work as if nothing had happened.

118
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,825
And they both went crazy.

119
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,851
All these terrible tales.

120
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:10,806
What stories? All of us will swallow
this fratricidal war, Stepan!

121
00:20:10,949 --> 00:20:12,378
In life, it does not allow it!

122
00:20:12,447 --> 00:20:16,732
-There was a world, mate? -What kind of world?
For what it is to us what we do with it?

123
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:18,418
Reservation.

124
00:20:19,193 --> 00:20:21,143
We do not know where the house is,
or where we go.

125
00:20:21,996 --> 00:20:24,533
Or in Serbia, or the sky.

126
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:09,853
I think that'll take
the whole garden.

127
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:28,836
Who do you leave the house?
You run, right?  January 28

128
00:21:30,605 --> 00:21:35,148
- I shall return. - You know Qom, not as
others, but I keep his house.

129
00:21:42,002 --> 00:21:43,411
Why you can not stop them?

130
00:21:53,889 --> 00:21:58,059
- It's a family heirloom.
- I know, from 1687-th.

131
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:02,501
Sometime in Vukovar after fire
left 106 people and 44 homes.

132
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:10,594
I will stay with the house.

133
00:22:18,173 --> 00:22:22,116
Darling, there you will be safe and
return to his.

134
00:22:31,891 --> 00:22:39,413
When you throw the land on which he lived
life, in the heart of unbearable emptiness...

135
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:44,958
I feel all never again
be the same.

136
00:23:00,304 --> 00:23:02,494
Give me the ball! Hey!

137
00:23:09,612 --> 00:23:13,901
What about you, huh? You can not let go
mad with from the latest news?

138
00:23:14,527 --> 00:23:17,271
Asleep in their country, and
woke abroad.

139
00:23:29,196 --> 00:23:33,313
And I think:
How are my in Sarajevo ...

140
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:43,437
-"There is no death, there is a movement."
- My father is fond of quoting.

141
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:53,350
"Dear friends, listen to the news."

142
00:23:54,327 --> 00:23:59,612
"Dear friends, let those come to love
yes kiss each other in the ass. "

143
00:27:03,807 --> 00:27:06,066
I can not understand what is happening.

144
00:27:08,445 --> 00:27:09,532
One war.

145
00:27:10,884 --> 00:27:13,073
The thought does not leave me ..

146
00:27:14,556 --> 00:27:20,053
.. Now, I know that every
has 20 million ancestors

147
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:25,689
And... I'll never believe that someone
not a drop of human blood.

148
00:27:35,794 --> 00:27:37,012
Good morning, neighbor!

149
00:27:44,853 --> 00:27:46,013
How did you sleep?

150
00:27:47,193 --> 00:27:48,196
Ana!

151
00:27:57,141 --> 00:27:58,567
Keep an eye on the house, Jovan!

152
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,803
Come here!

153
00:29:06,338 --> 00:29:09,020
Mother, full service.
What does this mean?

154
00:29:12,115 --> 00:29:16,290
Today, the best fish of the Danube.

155
00:29:17,251 --> 00:29:20,779
Capture still and wine.

156
00:29:32,762 --> 00:29:36,122
Just like always, only
one is missing.

157
00:29:36,506 --> 00:29:39,372
Well, for you!

158
00:29:46,491 --> 00:29:48,496
If you have always lived
in our home.

159
00:29:53,554 --> 00:29:54,245
Tom!

160
00:30:01,156 --> 00:30:02,332
Toom!

161
00:30:04,606 --> 00:30:05,527
I can not hear.

162
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:07,608
Speak up!

163
00:30:09,229 --> 00:30:10,078
Where are you?

164
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:13,188
That is good. Relocating.

165
00:30:13,648 --> 00:30:17,248
Where to? ... Where?

166
00:30:22,308 --> 00:30:24,116
Being moved closer to us.

167
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,624
Do not worry,
We do not Beirut!

168
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:34,628
Now listen to me!
Thou shalt be a father!

169
00:30:35,691 --> 00:30:37,090
Father!

170
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,283
Have you heard?

171
00:30:41,574 --> 00:30:43,300
I'm sure ..

172
00:30:46,003 --> 00:30:47,508
And I love you ...

173
00:30:48,006 --> 00:30:51,655
You know, we have many, many children.

174
00:30:57,305 --> 00:30:59,034
Connection was lost.

175
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,333
Do not know where to being moved.

176
00:31:04,746 --> 00:31:10,316
- Let me know when you can.  - It is
important that he is alive and well.

177
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,670
- For you! - For you!

178
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:30,206
"... If no agreement is reached, the
boundary will be monitored "UNPROFOR ..."

179
00:31:45,006 --> 00:31:48,001
- Oh, good evening. - Good evening.
Where are you from?

180
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:52,196
- On the case for you. Well, Stepan,
time to join.

181
00:31:52,301 --> 00:31:55,476
Do not you think I'm a little
old for this?

182
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:59,444
Or maybe you do not allow
this is your Serbian as well?

183
00:32:01,583 --> 00:32:03,668
Or do you want to slip between
two drops?

184
00:32:15,396 --> 00:32:16,883
- Comedy, and ...

185
00:32:19,007 --> 00:32:21,888
Far away you are from the care
about our country ...

186
00:32:23,103 --> 00:32:24,871
There are many ways to distort
love of country.

187
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:31,647
Ana!

188
00:32:33,253 --> 00:32:34,637
Where is your husband?

189
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:36,921
Has not deserted?

190
00:32:39,704 --> 00:32:43,830
Peter, do not today .....
Family feast, you know.

191
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,183
- Come on.
- Help yourself!

192
00:32:48,201 --> 00:32:50,893
No, thank you. Good night.
- Good night.

193
00:33:00,537 --> 00:33:02,726
- Good night.
- Good night.

194
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:11,813
Open and breathe a little air
Breathe.

195
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:34,183
"Clean air Croatian"

196
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:40,696
Exercise on an air-raid.
Necessary to go to the basement.

197
00:33:43,243 --> 00:33:45,977
I do not want in old age
play war

198
00:33:50,338 --> 00:33:52,504
Please do not take into
by heart the news ...

199
00:33:54,304 --> 00:33:55,782
Put out the light!

200
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:08,162
I remember this window I looked
at the people, the Danube, the sky ..

201
00:34:09,201 --> 00:34:16,716
She felt it all: the city,
landscape and my cloud ...

202
00:34:18,505 --> 00:34:21,042
And there was a part of their ...

203
00:34:22,503 --> 00:34:24,312
Here, with which I grew up.

204
00:34:26,008 --> 00:34:29,653
Patriotism to me .. love.

205
00:34:31,461 --> 00:34:34,311
I spent a few months
outside the city.

206
00:34:35,504 --> 00:34:39,253
It was not possible to call Anya
I did not know where I was.

207
00:34:40,931 --> 00:34:44,429
Both in this country and in the army
Strange things were happening.

208
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:49,573
Betrayal. Deserters fled to
another country, or abroad.

209
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:51,777
Left whole barracks.

210
00:34:52,579 --> 00:34:56,820
Did not understand ..
To whom is this war?

211
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:05,204
Shoot them to attack
enemy.

212
00:35:06,264 --> 00:35:08,025
Such as I had
very little.

213
00:35:15,615 --> 00:35:18,158
Well, as the world through the scope?

214
00:35:21,156 --> 00:35:23,369
As if for the first time I've seen
human face.

215
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:26,035
Get used to it.

216
00:35:27,101 --> 00:35:28,675
Sick at heart?

217
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:34,841
Will I be able to kill?

218
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:41,425
"Sometimes I dream, to fly away ...

219
00:36:43,478 --> 00:36:48,382
"Take off like damn ...

220
00:36:52,278 --> 00:36:58,076
"Right on the north,
until they get tired wings ... "

221
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:03,645
After the call
Tom vanished into thin air.

222
00:37:04,612 --> 00:37:07,649
I'm concerned that is thrown
throughout Yugoslavia.

223
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:13,563
He talked about a military
ground in Slovenia, I remember.

224
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:21,081
"This is our home ...

225
00:37:21,419 --> 00:37:27,901
"Oh, no land is better ..."

226
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:31,490
"There's a long way ...

227
00:37:32,145 --> 00:37:35,475
"There daleekoo ...

228
00:37:35,501 --> 00:37:38,532
"There's a long way ...

229
00:37:38,692 --> 00:37:41,921
"Far away from the sea ...

230
00:37:42,259 --> 00:37:45,474
"Far away from the sea ..."

231
00:38:00,201 --> 00:38:06,829
"This is our home ..."

232
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:11,499
He said that he could send to Dubrovnik
like there is now the southern front line.

233
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:20,699
Seeing the besieged barracks I realized that
the war was everywhere. Yves our heads.

234
00:38:21,366 --> 00:38:24,758
"There daleekoo ...

235
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:29,648
"Far away from the sea ..."

236
00:38:41,256 --> 00:38:44,200
- Where to? - In the barracks.
Husband looking for.

237
00:38:44,396 --> 00:38:47,464
Military or what? Get out!

238
00:38:51,105 --> 00:38:52,155
Hands up!

239
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:05,672
You carry the water to her husband?
Not seen 20 days.

240
00:39:09,202 --> 00:39:12,407
Checks clear whether he pants, aha?

241
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:15,379
Do not fuck up in fear.

242
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:18,437
- What kind of relationship?
- You're a freak, shut up!

243
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:23,762
- What to do with them? - If their lives
road, let them return home.

244
00:39:29,603 --> 00:39:30,296
Ana!

245
00:39:34,183 --> 00:39:35,254
What happened?

246
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,103
Denied.

247
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,165
Why was I refused?

248
00:39:45,974 --> 00:39:47,754
Because your husband - a Serb.

249
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:49,202
And what about you?

250
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,818
I am very loyal. My husband -
Croats.

251
00:39:53,488 --> 00:39:54,529
What about me?

252
00:39:56,117 --> 00:39:58,486
What about me?

253
00:40:00,484 --> 00:40:03,584
Come on, I'll show you where
You can buy flour.

254
00:40:25,353 --> 00:40:29,772
Stepan, no time for empty cases.

255
00:40:31,342 --> 00:40:34,076
Now in vogue for coffins
Dead.

256
00:40:34,607 --> 00:40:37,822
Whew. I will not go with you.

257
00:40:44,415 --> 00:40:48,485
Well, unless of course, you must ..

258
00:40:58,248 --> 00:41:01,581
- It is with a weapon that does not
know how to handle.  - To learn.

259
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:12,320
And you? When you get
back to your parents?

260
00:41:14,006 --> 00:41:15,033
Cute - your country ...

261
00:41:17,123 --> 00:41:18,353
Stop it!

262
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:54,841
The country has a civil war broke
out. Rose Vukovar, all mixed up.

263
00:41:55,565 --> 00:42:00,402
Which of my friends dressed in a form
Croatian armed forces?

264
00:42:01,488 --> 00:42:03,167
Another 100 miles.

265
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:04,871
Ana ...

266
00:42:05,616 --> 00:42:09,732
So we're going to Vukovar
that everyone wanted.

267
00:42:30,134 --> 00:42:33,503
5 minutes free.
5 minutes to the toilet.

268
00:44:15,443 --> 00:44:17,288
The smoke could not see anything.

269
00:44:18,363 --> 00:44:21,661
It hurts when you realize that there
nothing is left of my life ..

270
00:44:23,508 --> 00:44:27,017
I never thought that I would look
to his native town through sniper scope.

271
00:44:28,594 --> 00:44:33,073
And Ana is so close
and so is not available.

272
00:44:35,611 --> 00:44:39,151
I remember sailing boat on the Danube ...

273
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,566
Did I want to kill someone?

274
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:51,905
First shooting in his hometown,
I felt real hatred.

275
00:44:53,890 --> 00:45:00,046
No, I did not kill, despite the growing
anger to those who knew until yesterday.

276
00:45:17,192 --> 00:45:19,708
"Yeah, I'm friends Belgrade,

277
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:24,412
"In Slavonia burning village ...

278
00:45:25,564 --> 00:45:28,216
"Yeah, I'm friends Belgrade,

279
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:32,520
"I can not over!"

280
00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:37,798
And you loved someone.

281
00:45:39,436 --> 00:45:41,858
Does anyone cry for you?

282
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:47,816
You think I brought
on their shoes Serbian land.

283
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,455
How to understand this?

284
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,500
Leko now understand ...

285
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,672
Yes, I'm friends Zagreb.

286
00:47:11,890 --> 00:47:13,015
Cease fire!

287
00:47:14,546 --> 00:47:19,178
Guys! Ideal for
recovery and tracking beauty. Let's go!

288
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:20,977
Let's go! Let's go!

289
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:33,099
Who did that, Ana
back in love with you.

290
00:47:33,447 --> 00:47:36,962
Macedonian! Only you can
entrust their head.

291
00:47:39,321 --> 00:47:43,299
I will try, and we will then
remember what you had a beautiful body.

292
00:47:45,198 --> 00:47:47,620
- What is it?
- Shaving cream.

293
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:22,588
Look, in our house
will not listen to Serbian lies.

294
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,178
How do you know the truth, if not
listen to both sides?

295
00:48:30,890 --> 00:48:34,212
"As the people who stayed
without homes and property ...

296
00:48:34,326 --> 00:48:36,089
"... Will survive in the area in
coming winter ..

297
00:48:36,108 --> 00:48:38,796
"No one can say for sure ..."

298
00:48:43,890 --> 00:48:52,317
Listen: some scholars argue
that space - a living creature ..

299
00:48:53,890 --> 00:48:57,817
And if we are descended from monkeys,
in the words of Darwin?

300
00:49:03,332 --> 00:49:06,591
Decide which country you will be
to live, and who will bear ...

301
00:49:09,272 --> 00:49:13,661
What happened? Are you nervous because
things that can not change.

302
00:49:15,128 --> 00:49:17,349
Hunger is much better
transferred alone.

303
00:49:21,092 --> 00:49:21,671
Where to?

304
00:49:22,890 --> 00:49:23,678
For bread.

305
00:49:23,812 --> 00:49:24,747
For bread?

306
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:27,170
Everywhere in the city there is no flour.

307
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,909
No need for flour
danger.

308
00:49:30,873 --> 00:49:33,065
I know where to eat bread
exchanged for gold.

309
00:49:59,203 --> 00:50:00,455
Wait a minute!

310
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:04,726
On!

311
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:33,606
Did not bring me peace
last look at the parental home.

312
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,991
Why I went to buy bread?

313
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,328
All ran out of the city ..
around was indifferent ..

314
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,370
Those pictures could not
erased from my memory ..

315
00:51:48,453 --> 00:51:55,707
And always thought that among the dead
living or find a husband.

316
00:51:57,001 --> 00:52:00,747
Can be walked through the streets with
the hope I catch up with that bullet ...

317
00:52:02,508 --> 00:52:04,467
Vukovar became a cemetery ..

318
00:52:15,102 --> 00:52:22,713
At the place in the city museum,
between archaeological finds,

319
00:52:23,656 --> 00:52:25,899
Tom showed and explained
everything to me ..

320
00:52:27,455 --> 00:52:30,208
what do you need to achieve
just one kiss.

321
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:46,581
I was so in love that five thousand years
culture I was completely indifferent ...

322
00:52:49,595 --> 00:52:58,232
But now I realized that intolerance
all turned to dust and ashes.

323
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:11,340
In gordskom museum I realized
that love to death.

324
00:53:17,207 --> 00:53:18,970
In the museum, I proposed to her.

325
00:53:20,171 --> 00:53:25,306
Anya "yes" sounded fine
between these walls.

326
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:31,429
Ironically, this parable
was a story about the kiss.

327
00:53:32,242 --> 00:53:34,338
I am fascinated by your essay
the kiss.

328
00:55:10,670 --> 00:55:14,311
Orphan. Do not know
that her father had died.

329
00:55:18,393 --> 00:55:22,048
He should have stayed
in Sweden.

330
00:55:23,405 --> 00:55:25,190
If it had not been taken to the front.

331
00:55:26,512 --> 00:55:27,719
How absurd!

332
00:55:30,482 --> 00:55:34,131
Maybe our husbands shoot
each other.

333
00:55:50,890 --> 00:55:52,253
Good evening, women.

334
00:55:53,049 --> 00:55:54,139
Are you alone?

335
00:55:58,579 --> 00:56:02,476
Let's see what we have here ...
And how are you?

336
00:56:05,161 --> 00:56:06,242
Carried away!

337
00:56:22,237 --> 00:56:23,357
Who are you?

338
00:56:24,617 --> 00:56:25,345
We?

339
00:56:28,538 --> 00:56:30,320
We have dogs of war.

340
00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:42,909
Hush you.

341
00:56:43,107 --> 00:56:45,455
Carried away! You know how many
it now stands?

342
00:56:52,670 --> 00:56:54,627
Sit ... Bore!

343
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:58,378
I can see the rings as well?

344
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:02,617
Women, women ...

345
00:57:07,207 --> 00:57:08,580
Let me go, I'm pregnant!

346
00:58:09,109 --> 00:58:09,780
Let me go.

347
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:13,301
Let see these men.

348
00:58:16,189 --> 00:58:19,020
That's how I am! I'll show you!

349
00:58:33,752 --> 00:58:34,905
Watch it, break it.

350
00:59:10,322 --> 00:59:11,361
Someone is coming!

351
00:59:33,255 --> 00:59:37,038
This is my chance!
ShPodumay head, it's dangerous!

352
00:59:38,544 --> 00:59:40,692
Not! By Ani!

353
00:59:41,961 --> 00:59:44,589
The bird will not fly.

354
00:59:49,396 --> 00:59:50,560
Where is your home?

355
00:59:50,890 --> 00:59:58,188
Here, behind the theater, along the water
tower, and through the gardens ...

356
01:00:02,338 --> 01:00:05,869
At this point I and Ana
watched last performance.

357
01:00:07,098 --> 01:00:10,900
Breathed a crowded theater ...

358
01:00:12,163 --> 01:00:13,862
This is a ghost?

359
01:00:14,889 --> 01:00:17,990
Where have you gone, when
my heart beats here?

360
01:00:19,006 --> 01:00:22,546
Earth revolves stupid
around its axis ...

361
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:49,826
Ana!

362
01:01:57,890 --> 01:01:59,954
That's his way,
go and hug.

363
01:02:13,207 --> 01:02:14,243
It is dangerous ...

364
01:02:17,501 --> 01:02:18,498
Are you hungry?

365
01:02:51,204 --> 01:02:52,326
What happened?

366
01:02:54,850 --> 01:02:56,863
All sold,
to eat.

367
01:03:00,790 --> 01:03:01,829
Tell me.

368
01:03:03,989 --> 01:03:04,922
Does not matter.

369
01:03:07,361 --> 01:03:09,521
It is important that you
are alive and well.

370
01:03:13,508 --> 01:03:14,798
And on the right side.

371
01:03:16,553 --> 01:03:17,937
And which side is right?

372
01:03:37,455 --> 01:03:38,669
Dead.

373
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:44,624
I'm sorry.

374
01:03:47,528 --> 01:03:49,019
And I do not know anything about his.

375
01:03:52,443 --> 01:03:54,627
Why this war,
if all were killed ...

376
01:03:59,810 --> 01:04:01,456
I could not come earlier.

377
01:04:04,493 --> 01:04:07,866
- I'll take you out to safety.
- How far away from here.

378
01:04:08,806 --> 01:04:12,936
In Tasmania ...
at the end of the world.

379
01:04:17,225 --> 01:04:19,042
Well dad said ...

380
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:24,766
The truth
at one time, tomorrow - confusing.

381
01:04:29,148 --> 01:04:30,784
It was all a lie ..

382
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,692
Everything was destroyed ...

383
01:04:45,226 --> 01:04:46,181
Ana, listen to me!

384
01:04:49,890 --> 01:04:50,836
I love you!

385
01:04:58,428 --> 01:04:59,771
Here's how it happened ..

386
01:05:02,276 --> 01:05:03,213
know what I mean ...

387
01:05:04,422 --> 01:05:05,514
and children will not be.

388
01:05:06,870 --> 01:05:09,639
You see, there was all the worst.

389
01:05:11,890 --> 01:05:13,379
Neither you nor I are not to blame.

390
01:05:18,282 --> 01:05:21,446
Why, instead of happiness, of
a curse on us.

391
01:05:24,389 --> 01:05:26,391
And nothing can be done ..

392
01:05:28,461 --> 01:05:30,619
I'll never forget ..

393
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:34,106
With the new life that
born in such chaos ...

394
01:05:35,203 --> 01:05:38,294
It seems to me all at once
both inside and outside ...

395
01:05:39,870 --> 01:05:43,871
May at the time of death
I wake up a woman?

396
01:05:45,048 --> 01:05:47,911
Seems to stop time of year.

397
01:05:48,890 --> 01:05:53,121
In memory of one eternal winter.

398
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,481
Everywhere street fighting

399
01:05:57,450 --> 01:05:58,521
We must go!

400
01:05:59,129 --> 01:06:00,747
Come on, no doubt,
we can not go.

401
01:06:00,999 --> 01:06:02,214
I'm not going anywhere.

402
01:06:02,939 --> 01:06:04,407
I'll take you to safety.

403
01:06:04,567 --> 01:06:07,446
A safe place is in the
basement of the Radko.

404
01:06:09,890 --> 01:06:11,066
Take care of yourself!

405
01:06:12,890 --> 01:06:15,814
Wake up, open your eyes.

406
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,051
Tomo!

407
01:07:52,239 --> 01:07:53,360
Cease fire!

408
01:08:08,202 --> 01:08:10,844
Repair the roof,
to not flooded.

409
01:08:20,213 --> 01:08:21,128
No one.

410
01:08:45,385 --> 01:08:46,361
Where are the others?

411
01:08:47,620 --> 01:08:52,865
I am alone, my husband disappeared.
I do nothing about it I do not know.

412
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:57,013
Who from this shoot?

413
01:08:57,340 --> 01:08:59,005
I do not know how to shoot.

414
01:08:59,206 --> 01:09:02,924
Now learn, not special
wisdom.

415
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:07,485
What is your nationality?

416
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:12,088
Croatian.

417
01:09:42,104 --> 01:09:45,272
Do not be afraid ... Go!

418
01:09:53,749 --> 01:09:55,698
Come on, soldier!

419
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:59,352
Tie your wounds.

420
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,891
Do not be afraid ... Go!

421
01:10:06,106 --> 01:10:09,291
How many today spilled blood.

422
01:10:10,891 --> 01:10:13,574
Except menstruation ...

423
01:10:14,295 --> 01:10:16,754
Money. War is business.

424
01:10:19,739 --> 01:10:21,437
Show wound!

425
01:10:40,580 --> 01:10:43,201
Preparing for the orphans
in the basement.

426
01:10:44,639 --> 01:10:48,583
Cook a pig that ate people.

427
01:10:49,019 --> 01:10:53,119
Varish that then?
Pork or human flesh?

428
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,813
Are you hungry, son?

429
01:11:05,203 --> 01:11:06,023
I'm sick.

430
01:11:09,289 --> 01:11:10,767
Now, let go ... sginesh

431
01:11:11,890 --> 01:11:14,885
Do not listen. Go all the way!

432
01:11:36,129 --> 01:11:39,113
I'll explain about
The "butterfly effect."

433
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:46,123
In the Balkans pomashut wings
a hurricane in the Atlantic begins.

434
01:11:46,425 --> 01:11:52,343
In other words, with each offense
the whole world is getting worse.

435
01:11:59,380 --> 01:12:02,273
There are many correct,
everything is destroyed.

436
01:12:08,486 --> 01:12:09,576
Teach her to shoot!

437
01:12:12,780 --> 01:12:15,190
Replace us in battle,
if anything, huh?

438
01:12:22,304 --> 01:12:23,574
So, so ...

439
01:12:25,924 --> 01:12:26,908
That's it.

440
01:12:28,225 --> 01:12:31,481
Gently ... but firmly.

441
01:12:32,222 --> 01:12:33,270
As a woman.

442
01:12:39,205 --> 01:12:40,987
Woman, violated the truce!

443
01:12:47,890 --> 01:12:53,832
I. .. always afraid
... snipers.

444
01:12:54,503 --> 01:12:55,793
What a life ...

445
01:12:57,137 --> 01:13:00,288
In the home garden, there
enemy nest.

446
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:10,960
Call to Arms!

447
01:13:21,202 --> 01:13:24,993
Push to the ground, here for
snipers good view!

448
01:13:27,890 --> 01:13:29,421
We were well in sight!

449
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:34,637
When all this is over, you postroyut
even better than the old city.

450
01:14:28,988 --> 01:14:30,496
Stop it!

451
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:40,982
Stop it!

452
01:15:58,952 --> 01:16:00,335
There is a Serb?

453
01:16:00,742 --> 01:16:02,283
- There is.
- No.

454
01:16:02,619 --> 01:16:03,406
No!

455
01:16:25,303 --> 01:16:27,745
You're always raving in his sleep.

456
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:31,233
Who are you?

457
01:16:31,703 --> 01:16:32,542
Nobody's.

458
01:16:33,129 --> 01:16:33,893
Itself.

459
01:16:40,317 --> 01:16:41,587
Are you thirsty?

460
01:16:46,459 --> 01:16:47,497
How are you little?

461
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,491
It's nothing.

462
01:16:53,012 --> 01:16:54,771
Do not cry, do not.

463
01:17:13,588 --> 01:17:14,734
Live.

464
01:17:15,557 --> 01:17:16,530
Stuffy!

465
01:17:18,130 --> 01:17:20,864
Do not choke, do not worry.

466
01:17:23,487 --> 01:17:24,592
You warm, darling?

467
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,865
As we were in the thick of it?

468
01:17:34,203 --> 01:17:39,492
Forgotten and the day and month, more
little and forget the year.

469
01:17:42,757 --> 01:17:44,284
This is my calendar.

470
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,133
Whom bear?

471
01:17:47,207 --> 01:17:49,784
Croatia? Serbia?

472
01:17:50,890 --> 01:17:51,971
Yugoslavia.

473
01:18:20,690 --> 01:18:22,074
Congratulate her husband.

474
01:18:25,780 --> 01:18:28,159
What to do
when the time comes?

475
01:18:31,804 --> 01:18:32,820
We'll see ...

476
01:18:39,166 --> 01:18:40,311
I want out!

477
01:18:41,184 --> 01:18:42,223
Take it easy!

478
01:18:49,380 --> 01:18:53,140
Your kindness does not unwind
my illusions about humanity.

479
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:57,068
I'll cook something hot.

480
01:20:25,005 --> 01:20:28,525
Now you see how you
castrates a real woman.

481
01:20:41,871 --> 01:20:42,707
Where to?

482
01:20:43,704 --> 01:20:46,500
I want to have a baby, not a mouse ...

483
01:22:36,144 --> 01:22:39,485
Take all
I like it.

484
01:22:39,717 --> 01:22:45,602
Today, all for free.
We reached the goal.

485
01:22:46,379 --> 01:22:49,563
Long live the people ...

486
01:22:50,889 --> 01:22:53,300
Long live the people ...

487
01:26:44,223 --> 01:26:45,874
This movement ....

488
01:26:47,153 --> 01:26:48,346
But it is death.

489
01:26:51,152 --> 01:26:56,408
Yes, I can answer your questions:
who, what, where, when, why ...

490
01:26:58,930 --> 01:27:02,408
It is necessary to consider not only
last days and years ...

491
01:27:03,571 --> 01:27:05,207
... but the past century.

492
01:27:07,579 --> 01:27:09,676
Maybe it's not that.

493
01:27:11,249 --> 01:27:13,512
But if the world was different.

494
01:27:15,318 --> 01:27:17,215
We must protect our memory.

495
01:27:19,598 --> 01:27:22,361
It seems to me that all
this time I was sleeping ...

496
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:26,362
Every day - history.

497
01:27:28,352 --> 01:27:29,529
Nightmare

498
01:27:31,870 --> 01:27:33,675
A terrible awakening.

499
01:27:36,003 --> 01:27:39,564
"Early Spring Awakening ...

500
01:27:40,608 --> 01:27:43,802
"And the sweet pain in my chest ...

501
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:50,940
"A song is ..
.. What can and can sing ..

502
01:27:53,636 --> 01:27:59,133
"And the most votes will be heard
beautiful women ..

503
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:08,189
"And then the bass ..

504
01:28:10,890 --> 01:28:14,440
"And the old thunder ...

505
01:28:15,338 --> 01:28:25,699
"And the barrage -
like Tchaikovsky's "1812, that" ...

506
01:28:28,422 --> 01:28:31,586
"Early Spring Awakening ...

507
01:28:32,770 --> 01:28:36,166
"And the sweet pain in my chest ...

"A song is ..

01:29:20,690 --> 01:29:26,385
"Then come to vote,
strong, masculine ...

01:29:29,267 --> 01:29:35,069
"All veterans and
forgotten heroes ...

511
01:29:37,880 --> 01:29:41,336
"With the heart of a young falcon ...

512
01:29:42,300 --> 01:29:45,734
"And with the song instead of cold ..

513
01:29:46,770 --> 01:29:52,132
"Blossoms land flowing river ...

"The song is so ...
what can and can sing. "
