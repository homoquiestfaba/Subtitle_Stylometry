00:00:34,168 --> 00:00:37,849
<i>... too small to see
over the edge of a table.</i>

5
00:00:39,601 --> 00:00:42,433
there is a snow globe.

6
00:00:42,954 --> 00:00:47,675
And I remember the penguin
who lived inside the globe

7
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:55,915
He was all alone in there
and I worried for him.

8
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,056

<i>I love the way, a photo
could capture a moment.</i>

17
00:02:28,787 --> 00:02:31,016
<i>Before it was gone.</i>

21
00:02:42,536 --> 00:02:48,335
<i>I imagined that,
when i'll be older I'll be tracking wild elephants
and rhinos.</i>

22
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:52,216
<i>But, for now, I'd have
to make deal with Grace Tarking.</i>

23
00:03:08,852 --> 00:03:12,533
<i>Its strange the memories you keep</i>

24
00:03:12,667 --> 00:03:18,243
<i>I remember going with dad
to the sink-hole out at the Connor's farm.</i>

25
00:03:24,266 --> 00:03:29,803
<i>it was something about the way
the earth could swallow things whole</i>

26
00:03:32,355 --> 00:03:37,722
<i>And I remember the girl who lived there.
Ruth Connors.</i>

<i>we weren't those people...</i>

44
00:05:38,545 --> 00:05:44,544
<i>... those unlucky people, to whom
bad things happened for no reason.</i>

45
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:55,155
You know the Buddha said,
"If you save someone else's life...

46
00:05:55,190 --> 00:06:01,007
<i>My grandmother predicted me a long and happy life because i'ved saved  my brother.</i>

47
00:06:01,042 --> 00:06:04,956

<i>Over feature stories

53

<i>It was back when people
believed things like that didn't happen.</i>

54
00:06:42,271 --> 00:06:47,655
No matter what size you have,
it's all perfectly.

55
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:50,663
If you got it...
- Hold on, buddy.

56
00:06:50,681 --> 00:06:53,361

62
00:07:37,841 --> 00:07:43,121
You're safe.
He is in the record.

63
00:07:44,281 --> 00:07:49,360
<i>I was not safe. A man in
my neighborhood was watching me.</i>

64
00:07:49,395 --> 00:07:54,025
If I was not so distracted, I had
had in mind that something was not right.

65
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,778
Because usually I get chills.

66
00:07:57,813 --> 00:08:03,082
<i>but i was too busy, thinking about
the length of Ray Singh's eyelashes.</i>

67
00:08:03,117 --> 00:08:10,193
<i>I counted each one in library time
while he was reading 'Abelard and Heloise'</i>

176
00:18:12,025 --> 00:18:15,953
Hi, Ray.
- What did you think of the Moor?

177
00:18:16,479 --> 00:18:19,151
Who?

178
00:18:19,346 --> 00:18:22,111
Othello.

179
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,150
I just ...

180
00:18:27,185 --> 00:18:30,190
It was amazing.
I mean ...

181
00:18:30,225 --> 00:18:33,855
Really incredible.

182
00:18:35,439 --> 00:18:38,023
I love that play

183
00:18:38,058 --> 00:18:41,646
that's another thing we have in common.

184
00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:46,390
What we have in common then?

185
00:18:49,511 --> 00:18:52,446
Do not you know?

186
00:18:58,852 --> 00:19:00,645
Crap.

187
00:19:02,748 --> 00:19:05,404
It's OK.
- Fine, I could help.

188
00:19:05,822 --> 00:19:09,125
Stupid books.
I do not even read them.

189
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:12,880
Susie, what are you doing Saturday?

190
00:19:28,304 --> 00:19:31,720
Are you really from England?

191
00:19:32,792 --> 00:19:35,056
Yes.

192
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:48,568
You are beautiful, Susie Salmon.

193
00:19:59,796 --> 00:20:02,221
Whatever.

00:20:22,052 --> 00:20:23,678
Walk.

200
00:20:24,245 --> 00:20:28,270

because I've built something over here and i want to
get second opinion on it. do you want to take a look?

223
00:23:14,266 --> 00:23:17,961
I should really go home.

224
00:23:18,608 --> 00:23:20,712
Oh, OK

225
00:23:25,409 --> 00:23:30,496
I've worked so hard on it,
and would like someone else sees it ...

226
00:23:30,531 --> 00:23:35,656
but that's Ok. I think the other kid in the
neighbourhood would be so excited about it.

227
00:23:37,453 --> 00:23:41,077
Really?
- Yes.

228
00:23:41,112 --> 00:23:44,230

Come on, two minutes.

230
00:23:55,134 --> 00:23:58,397
You're probably already too late.

231
00:24:06,869 --> 00:24:10,765
I don't see anything.
- you don't?

232
00:24:11,298 --> 00:24:14,459
Then you will still need to look better.

233
00:24:39,438 --> 00:24:41,145
What is it?

234
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:45,007
I've washed my hands.
- Good. You have to be dry.

235
00:24:48,635 --> 00:24:49,921

But she is older.

242

I build it for the kids in the neighborhood. ...

243
00:25:21,596 --> 00:25:27,388
i think it could be used as a kind of clubhouse or i don't know

244
00:25:27,798 --> 00:25:31,839
Would you be the first to "test m?

245
00:25:32,569 --> 00:25:36,253
Really?
- Yeah, go ahead. be fun

246
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,181
If so.

247
00:25:38,181 --> 00:25:40,398
- Corn and beans.

248
00:25:40,433 --> 00:25:43,043
If you eat them both you can stay up
to watching TV with me.

249
00:25:43,078 --> 00:25:44,926
No, thank you.

250
00:25:44,961 --> 00:25:47,036
I'll make a sign for her.

251
00:25:47,455 --> 00:25:50,920
that's it

252
00:26:07,663 --> 00:26:10,929
This is wonderful.

253
00:26:15,423 --> 00:26:17,972
She doesn't like bean
thats why she didn't come

254
00:26:18,007 --> 00:26:21,333
Put more precisely but
punishment that they should eat.

255
00:26:21,368 --> 00:26:24,086
I gotta eat too.
- Well, they just get beans.

256
00:26:24,121 --> 00:26:25,956
They are really nice.
- Caution.

257
00:26:25,991 --> 00:26:27,949
That's better.
- Throw them on it.

258
00:26:27,984 --> 00:26:31,445
They finally eat spinach,
There are also beans.

259
00:26:37,109 --> 00:26:39,637
Make yourself at home.

260
00:26:42,222 --> 00:26:45,151
This is really cool mr Harvey
- Yeah it's cool?

261
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:49,646

place you wanted to have.

Do you think she is still in the mall?

265
00:27:08,844 --> 00:27:13,315
Yes, probably with Clarissa.
- She could atleast call.

266
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:16,387

00:34:05,635 --> 00:34:08,482
Mom, Dad!

331
00:34:27,491 --> 00:34:32,717
Pink gloves and a beige rucksack.

332
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:36,425
Mom?

333
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:56,517

334
00:36:59,695 --> 00:37:05,304

335
00:37:13,912 --> 00:37:16,336
Secure that corner!

336
00:37:16,371 --> 00:37:20,416
And put the rest off with tape before
The whole neighborhood is.

337
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:23,420
And in light of the school.

338
00:37:27,204 --> 00:37:29,228
What is that?

339
00:37:35,736 --> 00:37:39,655
We have found evidence
in the corn field behind school.

340
00:37:40,047 --> 00:37:43,408
There was a cavity in the earth
alot of debries

341
00:37:43,443 --> 00:37:46,108
Mostky loose wood and brocken crates

342
00:37:46,143 --> 00:37:49,197
Probably remnants of
one or structure.

343
00:37:49,232 --> 00:37:51,813
And Susie?

344
00:37:53,277 --> 00:37:56,540
We have not found her.

345
00:37:56,823 --> 00:37:59,335
That is good.
isn't it?

346
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:04,399
We do have her hat, but you didn't find her
which means you really even don't know if she was there at all, right?

347
00:38:04,434 --> 00:38:08,496
That would be preferable?

348
00:38:18,911 --> 00:38:22,399
We have also found blood.

349
00:38:24,727 --> 00:38:28,360
a significant amount of blood.

350
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:35,855
very Sorry.

351
00:38:37,833 --> 00:38:40,258
We beat this through.
- How?

352
00:38:40,293 --> 00:38:43,344
i would take care of you

353
00:38:43,379 --> 00:38:45,766
You can not.
- All is well again.

354
00:38:45,801 --> 00:38:48,258
This is never good, Jack.

355
00:38:48,293 --> 00:38:52,392
We have to find her.
I promise we bring her home.

356
00:39:39,557 --> 00:39:44,183
You have my number, or else
Just get past the desk.

357
00:39:44,218 --> 00:39:46,302
Thanks for your time.
- Sure.

358
00:39:46,337 --> 00:39:48,949
A good day.
- You too.

359
00:40:35,806 --> 00:40:37,814
Mr. Harvey?
- Yes.

360
00:40:37,849 --> 00:40:40,822
Detective Len Fenerman.
- How are you doing?

361
00:40:40,913 --> 00:40:44,209

- sure.

362
00:40:44,244 --> 00:40:46,233
Come inside.
- Thank you

363
00:40:46,356 --> 00:40:50,851
I know why you're here. of course
If something happened ...

364
00:40:50,886 --> 00:40:53,412
we often blame ourself.

365
00:40:53,447 --> 00:40:59,603
all i can think about it now is
why i didn't see something or why i didn't hear something

366
00:41:00,396 --> 00:41:05,779
because surely that young girl must be screamed

367
00:41:07,788 --> 00:41:10,412
Would you like one?
- No, thank you

368
00:41:10,447 --> 00:41:14,771
But if you could just think back
She was wearing a blue jacket yellow .

369
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:17,811
About the same as this.

370
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:21,525
This blue jacket here?
- The darker blue jacket.

371
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:25,142
And on the second photograph you can see
the pants she wore.

372
00:41:25,718 --> 00:41:28,670
No, it does not ring a bell.

373
00:41:28,705 --> 00:41:30,705
But you were home that day?

374
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:33,251
What day?
- Last Wednesday.

375
00:41:33,286 --> 00:41:36,187
Last Wednesday ...

376
00:41:53,027 --> 00:41:56,795
Last Wednesday ...When I was home all day.

377
00:41:57,313 --> 00:42:01,602
I've probably done shopping ...

378
00:42:03,033 --> 00:42:06,221
but actually been here all day
for most part .

379
00:42:06,324 --> 00:42:09,783

00:42:11,189 --> 00:42:14,113

but You have kids?
- no i wish, i wish.

382
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:23,381
Is it bad if I just look?
- No.

383
00:42:25,181 --> 00:42:27,935
I make everything myself.

384
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:33,854
Yes, I make everything myself.
The tiles and furniture.

385
00:42:33,889 --> 00:42:37,058
I once made cabinets,
but there is no question after.

386
00:42:37,093 --> 00:42:41,576
I put probably too long,
but that's the perfectionist in me. i guess

387
00:42:41,593 --> 00:42:43,858
All it shows.
- Thank you

388
00:42:43,893 --> 00:42:46,856
-That's amazing craftsmanship.
-oh, well

389
00:42:46,891 --> 00:42:52,215
I took a risk and try something new
and discover the talent i didn't know i have

390
00:43:02,638 --> 00:43:08,217
What's that underneath the stairs?
- That would be the basement.

391
00:43:16,184 --> 00:43:18,440
Dad?

392
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,768
She's dead, isn't she?

393
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:41,687
<i>I was sleeping away. </i>

394
00:43:41,926 --> 00:43:44,578
<i>that's what it felt like.</i>

395
00:43:46,153 --> 00:43:49,554
<i>Life was leaving me.</i>

396
00:43:53,538 --> 00:43:56,738
<i>But I wasn't afraid</i>

397
00:43:59,691 --> 00:44:06,318
<i>Then I remembered there is something
i've mented to do.</i>

398
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:10,754
<i>somewhere's ment to be.</i>

399
00:44:27,401 --> 00:44:29,786
Ray?

400
00:44:44,331 --> 00:44:46,841

402
00:46:05,522 --> 00:46:08,930
Ray! Wait!

403
00:46:16,842 --> 00:46:19,586
Ray!

404
00:48:14,664 --> 00:48:17,836
<i>If I had bought one hours of love ...</i>

405
00:48:17,871 --> 00:48:21,411
<i>If that everything would be what I would get ...</i>

406
00:48:21,817 --> 00:48:26,505
<i>an hour of love upon this earth ...</i>

407
00:48:26,578 --> 00:48:33,065
<i>Then I would give my love
to see some more.</i>

408
00:49:03,278 --> 00:49:07,954
Are you the Moor?
- Why?

409
00:49:15,936 --> 00:49:19,465
I think this is yours.

410
00:49:25,959 --> 00:49:28,928

411
00:49:28,963 --> 00:49:31,704

I'm a poet.
You're quite good.

413

Do not you have somewhere to go?

414
00:49:46,975 --> 00:49:50,007
You miss her, don't you?

415
00:49:52,167 --> 00:49:54,967
I never knew what that meant.

416
00:49:55,414 --> 00:49:59,846
I've always thought that the
means gone. Frozen.

417
00:49:59,881 --> 00:50:05,181
It means gone.
She is gone.

418
00:50:07,518 --> 00:50:10,486
What if she isn't?

419
00:50:13,333 --> 00:50:16,997

of her life.

What's so funny about it?
- This is not heaven, not there yet.

432
00:51:08,466 --> 00:51:12,907
What is this place?
- this place is not really one place ...

433
00:51:12,942 --> 00:51:16,635
and also is not the other place

434
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:20,348
it's a bit of both.

435
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:29,293
What is that?
- thats where we're going.

436
00:51:29,908 --> 00:51:36,309
<i>Holly said there is a wide wide heaven
behind everything we know</i>

437
00:51:38,341 --> 00:51:43,499
<i>were there were no corn fields
and no memories.</i>

438
00:51:43,534 --> 00:51:46,964
<i>No grave</i>

439
00:51:48,532 --> 00:51:52,494
<i>But I wasn't looking beyond yet.</i>

440
00:51:52,728 --> 00:51:56,196
<i>I still looking back.</i>

441
00:52:04,124 --> 00:52:07,436
You can't go back.

00:52:15,109 --> 00:52:19,609
I do not know you.
Why are you here?

445
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:22,712
You must let go of the Earth.

446
00:52:22,747 --> 00:52:27,104
You're dead, Susie.
You have to leave.

447
00:52:28,464 --> 00:52:31,416
I have to go home.

448
00:53:23,552 --> 00:53:25,657
Dad!

449
00:54:28,721 --> 00:54:32,664
<i>My Murderer began
to feel safe.</i>

450
00:54:32,699 --> 00:54:37,912
He knew people wanted to move on.
He needed to forget.

451
00:54:38,022 --> 00:54:44,086
<i>He took comfort in the thought
no one was looking at him.</i>

452
00:54:52,587 --> 00:54:58,354
<i>But there was one thing my murderer did't understad.</i>

453
00:54:59,082 --> 00:55:05,250
<i>He did not understand how much a father
could love his child.</i>

454
00:55:41,152 --> 00:55:43,752
dad

455
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:21,680
It's ok.
it's gonna be ok.

456
00:56:21,739 --> 00:56:26,756
He knows I'm here.
My dad knows I'm here.

457
00:56:28,224 --> 00:56:31,400
I was still with him.

458
00:56:34,271 --> 00:56:39,256
I was not lost or frozen or gone.

459
00:56:39,291 --> 00:56:46,864
I was alive in my own perfect world.

460
00:58:00,178 --> 00:58:02,490
Dad?

461
00:58:02,803 --> 00:58:06,060
I saw Susie.

462
00:58:08,372 --> 00:58:11,914
She came into my room.

463
00:58:11,949 --> 00:58:14,251
She kissed me on the cheek.

464
00:58:14,286 --> 00:58:16,812
Come here buddy.

465
00:58:20,132 --> 00:58:23,220
I saw her too

466
00:58:23,255 --> 00:58:28,187
Dad? I think she listens.

467
00:58:41,452 --> 00:58:45,963
<i>She rolls all follow shot
- All?</i>

468
00:58:45,998 --> 00:58:51,428
<i>It is a crime to be creative.
- Shall we do a roll every month?</i>

469
00:58:51,463 --> 00:58:53,885
<i>One per month?</i>

470
00:58:57,750 --> 00:59:00,030
I have them.

471
00:59:00,065 --> 00:59:03,221
Look, some are pretty good.

472
00:59:05,284 --> 00:59:10,140
Why do you develop them all?
One per month so ...

473
00:59:10,175 --> 00:59:14,164
That is crazy.
- Why?

474
00:59:14,199 --> 00:59:16,992
I mean why we keep these things dragging out like this?

475
00:59:17,027 --> 00:59:20,224
We are not draging it out.
We had a deal.

476
00:59:20,259 --> 00:59:23,552
There is no deal, Jack.

477
00:59:37,904 --> 00:59:40,290
Fenerman
Len, I had to call you.

478
00:59:40,325 --> 00:59:43,263
Susie is smart.
She would never go off with a stranger.

479
00:59:43,298 --> 00:59:46,855
It must be someone she knows.
Somebody local.

480
00:59:48,615 --> 00:59:51,528

I've got Several names actually.

If I just drive by there and take a look myself?

486
01:00:14,229 --> 01:00:16,452

- Who?

487
01:00:16,453 --> 01:00:21,013

I know you to the obvious suspects.

493
01:00:39,224 --> 01:00:42,598
Convicted criminals. Child Rapists,

01:00:42,599 --> 01:00:44,841

01:00:44,861 --> 01:00:47,501
Honey.

496
01:00:47,502 --> 01:00:50,279

01:00:50,314 --> 01:00:52,503
The man wears adults diapers .

498
01:00:52,504 --> 01:00:55,602

500
01:00:59,114 --> 01:01:03,264
We must stop looking backward.
We need to see family histories.

501
01:01:03,265 --> 01:01:08,005
Criminal record, mental health issues ...
- Jack, this dosen't changes anything.

502
01:01:08,006 --> 01:01:11,823
Tax. You can do much about someone
tell on the basis of the tax.

503
01:01:11,824 --> 01:01:16,045
Do you now?
Can not you  leave it alone?

Hello, mother.

What will it be, Jack?

516
01:02:15,152 --> 01:02:19,364
I drink no more today.
- That is your problem in a nutshell.

517
01:02:21,784 --> 01:02:24,855
Are we still a family?
- Of course we are one family.

518
01:02:24,856 --> 01:02:27,321
Your mother is a crisis,
your father is a wreck.

519
01:02:27,322 --> 01:02:29,940
What's that make you?

520
01:02:31,750 --> 01:02:34,872
I'm in charged.

521
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:54,843
He walked through the woods, looking
to rabbits.

522
01:03:54,844 --> 01:03:59,546
Then he sees three. He grabs his gun,
look and point.

523
01:03:59,547 --> 01:04:02,945
And then a big smoke cloud,
He sees them not.

524
01:04:02,946 --> 01:04:09,353
Then he realizes that his gun
was, he had no more bullets. Then he runs.

525
01:04:54,437 --> 01:04:57,392
You're Salmon girl ? right

526
01:05:11,363 --> 01:05:12,504
Holiday

527
01:05:21,396 --> 01:05:25,805
Grandma, I know where Susie is.

528
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:31,560
Yeah, Susie is gone to heaven, sweetheart.
- Lindsey says there is no heaven.

529
01:05:31,595 --> 01:05:34,862
allright then she is dead.

530
01:05:35,566 --> 01:05:39,315
You will also soon died.
- Why do you say that?

531
01:05:39,316 --> 01:05:41,945
Because you're old.

532
01:05:41,946 --> 01:05:45,821
35 is not old. You
that smelled too much polish.

533
01:05:46,497 --> 01:05:50,375
There is also nothing to me.
You know why?

534
01:05:52,003 --> 01:05:55,996
Because  I take my medicine everyday.

535
01:05:57,044 --> 01:06:02,335
Grandma, she is here.

536
01:06:02,370 --> 01:06:04,648
What?
- Susie.

537
01:06:05,249 --> 01:06:08,520
Susie is in between.

538
01:06:23,168 --> 01:06:27,259
<i>I was in the blue horizon, between
heaven and earth.</i>

539
01:06:28,628 --> 01:06:31,523
<i>The days were unchanging.</i>

540
01:06:31,524 --> 01:06:35,765
<i>And every night I dreamed
the same dream.</i>

541
01:06:38,005 --> 01:06:43,348
<i>The smell of damn breath. The scream that
no one heard.</i>

542
01:06:45,035 --> 01:06:49,899
<i>The sound of my heart, that if hit
a hammer against a coffin.</i>

543
01:06:53,284 --> 01:06:59,233
<i>And I heard them calling.
The voices of the dead.</i>

544
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:05,769
<i>I wanted to follow them.
A way out.</i>

545
01:07:07,244 --> 01:07:10,827
<i>But I always came back
the same door.</i>

546
01:07:13,114 --> 01:07:15,666
<i>And I was afraid.</i>

547
01:07:18,344 --> 01:07:22,567
<i>I knew when I went in there ...</i>

548
01:07:22,568 --> 01:07:25,410
<i>I never go outside
would come.</i>

549
01:07:31,193 --> 01:07:35,626
<i>My Murderer could live in
one moment for a long time.</i>

550
01:07:35,627 --> 01:07:40,877
<i>He could feed a memory
over and over again.</i>

551
01:07:42,293 --> 01:07:46,206
<i>He was animal.
Faceless.</i>

552
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:49,076
<i>infinite.</i>

553
01:07:49,620 --> 01:07:54,263
<i>But then he would feel it.
The emptiness returning.</i>

554
01:07:54,850 --> 01:07:58,854
<i>And would need him again
to emerge.</i>

555
01:08:06,526 --> 01:08:08,844
Go.
- Here in?

556
01:08:08,845 --> 01:08:13,498
<i>When summer came he know this young
lovers who cornfield dunk.</i>

557
01:08:13,871 --> 01:08:18,108
<i>He began to follow them. And watched.</i>

558
01:08:33,958 --> 01:08:36,977
Are you coming to bed?

559
01:08:38,013 --> 01:08:40,925
Yes, soon.

560
01:09:00,598 --> 01:09:04,659
Buckley has done.
- Yes, he said that our house was ...

561
01:09:04,660 --> 01:09:08,776
This is the police, and this is you.
- This is me?

562
01:09:08,777 --> 01:09:12,296
Yes, he has made you chief of police.
- I've gained 20 pounds.

563
01:09:12,297 --> 01:09:15,626
That must be uniform.
- The danger of a desk job.

564
01:09:15,627 --> 01:09:20,958
I would give up a loss.
- Sit down.

565
01:09:30,010 --> 01:09:32,453
i'm living with this every day.
- what about your marriage?

566
01:09:32,454 --> 01:09:36,014
What marriage?
Jack sleeps in the den.

567
01:09:36,015 --> 01:09:39,435
You must find a way to go.
You have no choice.

568
01:09:39,436 --> 01:09:41,988
If you can not keep full,
you ... ah, bingo

569
01:09:41,989 --> 01:09:47,161
that's cooking Sherry .
- You must find a way to live with this.

570
01:09:47,162 --> 01:09:52,445
live with it? I'm living with this.
you're not

571
01:09:52,446 --> 01:09:54,367
I count them off. So?

572
01:09:54,368 --> 01:09:57,729
You have a tomb in the middle of your house.

573
01:09:59,008 --> 01:10:04,423
Oh sweetheart, do you really think if
you seal it up that the pain gonna go?

574
01:11:09,357 --> 01:11:12,275
My mother went so far as possible.<i></i>

575
01:11:12,276 --> 01:11:16,040
<i>She found a job at a small farm
just outside Santa Rosa.</i>

576
01:11:16,041 --> 01:11:19,897
<i>The work was hard, but
she did not mind.</i>

577
01:11:20,477 --> 01:11:25,362
<i>If anyone asked, she said
she had two children.</i>

578
01:11:26,087 --> 01:11:28,784
Dear Lindsey ...

579
01:11:41,328 --> 01:11:46,397
<i>And Lindsey, who always said
she didn't believe in love.</i>

580
01:11:47,958 --> 01:11:50,846
<i>found it anyway.</i>

581
01:12:12,928 --> 01:12:17,338
<i>And there it was. The moment
I would never know.</i>

582
01:12:19,352 --> 01:12:22,962
<i>My little sister had run ahead of me.</i>

583
01:12:22,963 --> 01:12:26,538
<i>She was growing up.</i>

584
01:12:29,752 --> 01:12:32,587
What is it?
I thought you would be happy.

585
01:12:33,510 --> 01:12:36,227
I'm happy.

586
01:12:38,088 --> 01:12:40,943
I am very happy.

587
01:12:40,944 --> 01:12:43,489
Why are you crying?

588
01:12:44,045 --> 01:12:50,286
You think she did not want to kiss?
- No, she did.

589
01:12:52,309 --> 01:12:55,370
She wanted to kiss him very much.

590
01:13:08,307 --> 01:13:11,643
<i>always I would watch Ray.</i>

591
01:13:11,644 --> 01:13:15,298
<i>I was in the air around him.</i>

592
01:13:15,299 --> 01:13:19,956
<i>I was in the cold winter mornings he
spent with Ruth Conner.</i>

593
01:13:19,957 --> 01:13:23,767
<i>That strange other worldly girl ...</i>

594
01:13:23,768 --> 01:13:29,354
<i>so easy the presence
accepted by the dead among the living.</i>

595
01:13:34,103 --> 01:13:38,739
<i>And sometimes thought Ray to me.</i>

596
01:13:38,740 --> 01:13:44,422
<i>But he began to wonder whether the
was time to stop that memory away.</i>

597
01:13:46,740 --> 01:13:49,572
Maybe it was time for me
to let go.

598
01:14:08,987 --> 01:14:11,483
Lindsey, throw it.

599
01:14:18,933 --> 01:14:21,404
Missing girl, Susie Salmon and
sister Lindsey Salmon (right)

600
01:14:55,947 --> 01:14:59,118
<i>My Murderer had finally tuned and stinked.</i>

601
01:14:59,493 --> 01:15:05,713
<i>He knew my sister had begun to wondered
about the solitary man who lived in the greenhouse .</i>

602
01:15:07,888 --> 01:15:11,344
<i>She seemed intend to him
to penetrate.</i>

603
01:15:11,345 --> 01:15:14,287
<i>And he resented it.</i>

604
01:15:32,083 --> 01:15:36,520
<i>He began to feel a familiar itch.</i>

605
01:16:14,564 --> 01:16:16,727
Roles to develop

606
01:16:36,318 --> 01:16:39,267
Mom, look.
- For a moment.

607
01:16:48,825 --> 01:16:52,397
Careful, honey.
- Mom.

608
01:16:59,327 --> 01:17:02,602
This is a beautiful ...

609
01:18:27,013 --> 01:18:29,018
Mom, look.

610
01:18:29,462 --> 01:18:32,610
Dad, look at me.

611
01:19:47,753 --> 01:19:50,362
Mr. Salmon, hello.

612
01:19:54,097 --> 01:19:59,332
What is that?
- A project I'm working on.

613
01:19:59,710 --> 01:20:03,136
Are you a hunter?
- Ducks.

614
01:20:05,192 --> 01:20:06,634
That is a blind right?
- Yes.

615
01:20:06,669 --> 01:20:09,787
Yes.
- Does it really?

616
01:20:09,788 --> 01:20:12,902
Yes.

617
01:20:12,903 --> 01:20:17,556
<i>It's all about concealment
the art of concealment .</i>

618
01:20:17,557 --> 01:20:21,446
And patience.
takes a lot of patience.

619
01:20:21,447 --> 01:20:26,194
For hours in the dark.
I love nature.

620
01:20:26,195 --> 01:20:29,074
i wish i have been.

621
01:20:51,517 --> 01:20:54,031
Mr. Salmon?

622
01:20:56,953 --> 01:21:02,842
I just, I never had a chance to
tell how i'm sorry about your lost

623
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:31,111
Dad

624
01:21:50,688 --> 01:21:55,502
Let me help you.
- I can manage.

625
01:21:55,537 --> 01:21:58,552
It is no trouble.

626
01:21:59,749 --> 01:22:03,276
allright, i'm appreciate it

627
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:11,788
Daddy, look.
- This is for you

628
01:22:11,789 --> 01:22:15,294
You are welcome.

629
01:22:15,295 --> 01:22:17,837
He smells delicious.

630
01:22:17,838 --> 01:22:21,442
Look at me.
- Careful, honey.

631
01:22:29,021 --> 01:22:32,014
He smells delicious.

632
01:22:32,369 --> 01:22:35,309
Delicious.
- Beautiful.

633
01:22:35,310 --> 01:22:38,912
dad

634
01:22:38,913 --> 01:22:41,708
Dad, look at me.

635
01:23:07,401 --> 01:23:10,474
I think you go home
must go, Mr. Salmon.

636
01:23:22,703 --> 01:23:24,087
go on home

637
01:23:30,885 --> 01:23:35,113
I'm sorry.
I can not help you.

638
01:23:37,555 --> 01:23:43,155
What have you done with my daughter?

639
01:23:44,103 --> 01:23:47,951
It must stop, Jack.
You were almost arrested tonight.

640
01:23:47,952 --> 01:23:50,772
You are lucky that George Harvey
no complaint.

641
01:23:50,773 --> 01:23:52,375
Lucky?

642
01:23:52,475 --> 01:23:55,019
Your father put a hole in the man
made back.

643
01:23:55,020 --> 01:23:57,156
He had a hole in his head to make.
- Lindsey, please.

644
01:23:57,191 --> 01:24:00,289
Did you hear that, Jack?
This example you give to your children.

645
01:24:00,389 --> 01:24:02,585
persecuting the neighbours.
- He is not crazy.

646
01:24:02,685 --> 01:24:05,115
I said no.
- Why do not you listen to him?

647
01:24:05,215 --> 01:24:07,571
Because you need proof, Lindsey.

648
01:24:07,572 --> 01:24:12,145
You can not accuse George Harvey
if you have no evidence.

649
01:24:12,146 --> 01:24:15,372
You need evidence.
- You're pathetic.

650
01:24:15,373 --> 01:24:20,358
Why do not you. You long
ago ceased to her.

651
01:24:20,359 --> 01:24:24,302
Len is right.

652
01:24:24,337 --> 01:24:28,242
It is time that we leave behind us.
It's been too long gone.

653
01:24:29,221 --> 01:24:31,962
This must stop.
- Papa ...

654
01:24:31,963 --> 01:24:35,192
Things follow their natural course, Lindsey.

655
01:24:35,193 --> 01:24:39,817
Len, I appreciate everything you've done.
You're a great friend to me.

656
01:24:43,509 --> 01:24:46,249
This also applies to Abigail.

657
01:24:46,250 --> 01:24:49,815
You're a great friend
for both of us.

658
01:25:33,992 --> 01:25:36,583
Murder changes everything.<i></i>

659
01:25:46,503 --> 01:25:50,059
<i>When I was alive,
I never hated anyone.</i>

660
01:25:50,060 --> 01:25:54,245
<i>But now hate everything I had.</i>

661
01:25:54,751 --> 01:25:57,793
<i>I want him dead.</i>

662
01:25:57,794 --> 01:26:03,144
<i>I want him cold and dead,
without blood in his veins.</i>

663
01:26:06,913 --> 01:26:10,345
Look at me once.

664
01:26:10,346 --> 01:26:13,963
Look what he has done to me.

665
01:26:13,964 --> 01:26:17,250
What am I now?
The dead girl?

666
01:26:17,251 --> 01:26:20,705
The lost girl?
The girl disappeared?

667
01:26:20,706 --> 01:26:23,688
I am nothing.

668
01:26:54,837 --> 01:26:57,399
I was So stupid.

669
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:02,758
I was so stupid.
- You do not control this, Susie.

670
01:27:18,696 --> 01:27:21,755
He does not own you.

671
01:27:21,756 --> 01:27:26,006
You can be free of him.
But not this way.

672
01:27:26,007 --> 01:27:29,582
What do you know?
You don't know anything.

673
01:27:29,583 --> 01:27:33,259
That man took my life

674
01:27:34,391 --> 01:27:39,856
You'll see, Susie.
In the end. You'll understand.

675
01:27:41,784 --> 01:27:45,046
Everyone dies.

676
01:28:07,883 --> 01:28:10,102
Brian?
- Go.

677
01:28:10,103 --> 01:28:11,956
Well then.

678
01:28:26,025 --> 01:28:28,279
Dad?

679
01:28:28,280 --> 01:28:32,016
Dad?

680
01:28:32,017 --> 01:28:35,325
Papa? I realized what I<i>
had done.</i>

681
01:28:35,326 --> 01:28:38,464
<i>I willed him to stop.</i>

682
01:28:44,982 --> 01:28:47,683
<i>I willed him to turn back.</i>

683
01:28:53,713 --> 01:28:57,153
I know it's you.
Come out.

684
01:28:57,596 --> 01:29:00,372
Come out. face me

685
01:29:00,373 --> 01:29:03,407
Did you hear me, son of the bitch?

686
01:29:08,997 --> 01:29:12,497
Go off me.

That happened after I was gone.

And I began to see things
in a way ...

787
01:57:24,619 --> 01:57:32,085
that let me hold the world
without me in it

788
