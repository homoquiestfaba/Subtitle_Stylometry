1
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:58,932
Pull yourself together, Teddy.
Pull yourself together.

2
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:07,024
It's just water.

3
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:10,193
It's a lot of water.

4
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,237
A lot of...

5
00:01:15,783 --> 00:01:17,159
Come on.

6
00:01:41,225 --> 00:01:44,353
- You okay, boss?
- Yeah, I'm fine, I just...

7
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:48,231
I just can't... Can't stomach the water.

8
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:54,404
- You're my new partner.
- That's right.

9
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,492
Not the best way to meet,
with my head halfway down the toilet.

10
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:01,620
Doesn't exactly square with
"Teddy Daniels, the man, the legend,"

11
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:04,164
- I'll give you that.
- The legend?

12
00:02:04,248 --> 00:02:06,917
What the hell you boys smoking
over there in Portland, anyway?

13
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:10,379
Seattle. I came from
the office in Seattle.

14
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:15,258
How long you been with the Marshals?

15
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:16,760
Four years.

16
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:20,681
So you know how small it is.

17
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,182
Sure.

18
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:26,186
What about you?
You got a girl? Married?

19
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:28,271
I was.

20
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:41,743
She died.

21
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,706
- Jesus. I don't...
- Don't worry about it.

22
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:50,335
There was a fire at the apartment
building while I was at work.

23
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,129
Four people died.

24
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:56,049
It was the smoke that got her,
not the fire. See, that's important.

25
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,843
I'm sorry, boss.

26
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:00,721
Where are my goddamn cigarettes?

27
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:02,889
Oh, here, have one of mine.

28
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:06,476
I could've sworn they were
in my jacket before I got on.

29
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:09,271
Government employees
will rob you blind.

30
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:12,941
Thanks.

31
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:16,737
They give you a briefing about
the institution before you left?

32
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:19,489
All I know is it's a mental hospital.

33
00:03:20,324 --> 00:03:22,451
For the criminally insane.

34
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,620
Well, if it's just folks running
around hearing voices

35
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:29,166
and chasing after butterflies,
they wouldn't need us.

36
00:03:38,342 --> 00:03:41,178
- Is that where we're headed?
- Yep.

37
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:44,055
The other side of the island
is rock bluffs

38
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,683
all the way down
to the edge of the water.

39
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:50,228
The dock, it's the only way on or off.

40
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:54,274
We'll be casting off
as soon as you two are ashore.

41
00:03:54,358 --> 00:03:56,985
I'd appreciate it if you'd hurry up about it.

42
00:03:57,069 --> 00:03:59,821
- Why?
- Storm's coming.

43
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:28,850
Never seen a Marshals badge before.

44
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,395
I'm Deputy Warden McPherson,
gentlemen.

45
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,647
Welcome to Shutter Island.

46
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:36,775
I'll be the one taking you
up to Ashecliffe.

47
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,957
Your boys seem a little on edge,
Mr. McPherson.

48
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,417
Right now, Marshal, we all are.

49
00:05:38,462 --> 00:05:40,714
Electrified perimeter.

50
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,301
How can you tell?

51
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:47,220
I've seen something like it before.

52
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:19,669
All right. You gentlemen will
be accorded all the help we can give,

53
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:22,714
but during your stay,
you will obey protocol.

54
00:06:22,798 --> 00:06:24,174
Is that understood?

55
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:25,634
Absolutely.

56
00:06:26,093 --> 00:06:29,429
The red brick building on your right
is Ward A, the male ward.

57
00:06:29,513 --> 00:06:32,891
Ward B, the female ward,
is the one on your left.

58
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:35,936
Ward C is that building on the bluffs.

59
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,604
An old Civil War fort.

60
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:40,106
The most dangerous patients
are housed there.

61
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:42,108
Admittance to Ward C is forbidden

62
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:44,861
without the written consent
and physical presence

63
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:47,489
of both myself and Dr. Cawley.

64
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,366
Is that understood?

65
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:52,744
You act like insanity is catching.

66
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:58,875
You are hereby required
to surrender your firearms.

67
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:03,755
Mr. McPherson, we are duly appointed
federal marshals.

68
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:06,341
We are required to carry our firearms
with us at all times.

69
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:09,427
Executive order 319
of the Federal Code of Penitentiaries

70
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,554
states that when inside a penitentiary,

71
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:15,058
the officers of that institution
have final authority.

72
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:21,940
Gentlemen, you will not get through
this gate with your firearms.

73
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:44,671
Okay. Now that the official stuff's done,
come on, boys,

74
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:46,715
what do you say we go find Dr. Cawley?

75
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:01,438
When did she escape? This prisoner?

76
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:05,692
I'm afraid Dr. Cawley will have
to fill you in on the situation. Protocol.

77
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:07,902
Correctional officers
at a mental institution,

78
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,155
that's a weird sight,
if you don't mind me saying.

79
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:13,658
It's the only facility of its kind in the U.S.,
even the world.

80
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,286
We take only the most dangerous,
damaged patients,

81
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,329
ones no other hospital can manage.

82
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:20,331
And it's all due to Dr. Cawley.

83
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,333
He's created something
really unique here.

84
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:26,004
It's a hospital for people our society
normally considers beyond treatment.

85
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,572
Top of his class at Johns Hopkins,
then Harvard...

86
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:55,742
IDs, gentlemen.

87
00:08:59,246 --> 00:09:01,372
Show your badges, gentlemen.

88
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:05,418
Dr. Cawley's been consulted
numerous times by Scotland Yard,

89
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,253
Ml5, the OSS...

90
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:08,922
Why?

91
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:10,673
What do you mean?

92
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:15,261
What do intelligence agencies
want to consult a psychiatrist about?

93
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:17,639
I guess you'll have to ask him.

94
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:29,526
- Marshal Daniels.
- Doctor.

95
00:09:29,985 --> 00:09:31,569
Marshal Aule.

96
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:34,739
Thank you, Deputy Warden.
That will be all.

97
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,492
Yes, sir. Pleasure, gentlemen.

98
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,829
He had a lot to say about you.

99
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:44,124
McPherson's a good man.
He believes in the work we do here.

100
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,501
And what would that be, exactly?

101
00:09:46,585 --> 00:09:50,255
A moral fusion between law and order
and clinical care.

102
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:53,341
Pardon me, Doc.
A what between what and what?

103
00:10:00,307 --> 00:10:03,351
Those paintings are quite accurate.

104
00:10:03,435 --> 00:10:05,311
Used to be the kind of patients
we deal with here

105
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:08,606
were shackled and left in their own filth.

106
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:09,983
They were beaten,

107
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:12,318
as if whipping them bloody
would drive the psychosis out.

108
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,487
We drove screws into their brains,

109
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:18,408
we submerged them in icy water
until they lost consciousness

110
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:20,952
or even drowned.

111
00:10:21,036 --> 00:10:22,996
- And now?
- We treat them.

112
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,290
Try to heal, try to cure.

113
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,000
And if that fails,
at least we provide them

114
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:30,336
with a measure of comfort
in their lives. Calm.

115
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:33,673
These are all violent offenders, right?

116
00:10:33,757 --> 00:10:36,009
I mean, they've hurt people.

117
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:40,513
- Murdered them in some cases.
- In almost all cases, yes.

118
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,432
Then, personally, Doctor,
I'd have to say,

119
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:44,893
screw their sense of calm.

120
00:10:46,478 --> 00:10:48,688
It's my job to treat my patients,
not their victims.

121
00:10:48,772 --> 00:10:50,231
I'm not here to judge.

122
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,942
- So this female prisoner...
- Patient.

123
00:10:53,777 --> 00:10:55,695
Excuse me. Patient,

124
00:10:55,779 --> 00:11:00,867
one Rachel Solando,
escaped sometime in the last 24 hours.

125
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:03,203
Last night between 10:00 and midnight.

126
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,871
Is she considered dangerous?

127
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:08,583
You could say that.
She killed all three of her children.

128
00:11:09,501 --> 00:11:12,378
She drowned them in the lake
behind her house.

129
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:15,757
She took them out one by one,
held their heads under till they died,

130
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:18,718
then she brought them back inside and
arranged them around the kitchen table.

131
00:11:18,802 --> 00:11:22,138
She ate a meal there
before a neighbor dropped by.

132
00:11:24,099 --> 00:11:27,977
- And what about the husband?
- He died on the beaches of Normandy.

133
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:32,065
She's a war widow. She starved herself
when she first came here.

134
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:34,984
She insisted the children weren't dead.

135
00:11:44,828 --> 00:11:47,580
Sorry, Doctor. You don't happen
to have an aspirin, do you?

136
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,332
Prone to headaches, Marshal?

137
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:52,669
Sometimes. But today,
I'm a little more prone to seasickness.

138
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:54,629
Dehydration.

139
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:56,339
- You all right, boss?
- Yeah.

140
00:11:56,423 --> 00:11:59,133
In that case, you're quite right.
The simpler the better.

141
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,760
Thanks so much.

142
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:04,639
Rachel still believes
the children are alive.

143
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:08,977
She also believes this place is her home
in the Berkshires.

144
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,229
You're kidding me.

145
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:12,563
She's never once in two years

146
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:14,315
acknowledged that
she's in an institution.

147
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,278
She believes we're all deliverymen,
milkmen, postal workers.

148
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:20,571
To sustain the delusion
that her children never died,

149
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,657
she's created
an elaborate fictional structure,

150
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:26,119
and she gives us all parts
to play in that fiction.

151
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:29,122
So have you searched the grounds yet?

152
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:31,791
The warden and his men
scoured the island.

153
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,376
Not a trace.

154
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:38,506
And what's more disturbing is we don't
know how she got out of her room.

155
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:42,385
It was locked from the outside,
and the only window is barred.

156
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:48,683
It's as if she evaporated
straight through the walls.

157
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:58,401
I brought her right back here
after group therapy, locked her in,

158
00:12:58,485 --> 00:13:01,487
came back for midnight rounds,
she was gone.

159
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:12,498
Seriously, Doctor, how is it possible
that the truth never gets through to her?

160
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,501
I mean,
she's in a mental institution, right?

161
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,587
Seems like something you'd notice
from time to time.

162
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:19,839
How many pairs of shoes
are the patients given?

163
00:13:19,923 --> 00:13:21,299
Two pairs.

164
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:25,636
Sanity's not a choice, Marshal.
You can't just choose to get over it.

165
00:13:26,221 --> 00:13:29,140
So, she left here barefoot?

166
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:33,019
Come on, Doc, she couldn't get
10 yards in that terrain.

167
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:35,688
Marshal?

168
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,709
This is definitely Rachel's handwriting.

169
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:59,629
I have no idea
what the law of four is, though.

170
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:02,548
- It's not a psychiatric term?
- I'm afraid not.

171
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,133
"Who is 67?"

172
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,469
Fuck if I know.

173
00:14:06,553 --> 00:14:10,390
I have to say that's quite close
to my clinical conclusion.

174
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:12,392
Think it's just random scribblings?

175
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:16,229
Oh, no, not at all. Rachel's smart.
Brilliant, in fact.

176
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:17,730
This paper could be important.

177
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:20,691
Excuse me, Doctor,
but we're gonna have to hold on to this.

178
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,151
Of course.

179
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:26,948
And you say
she had to come through here?

180
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:31,285
After lights out,
the orderlies play cards in here.

181
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,705
Last night, there were seven men
sitting at the base of those stairs

182
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,249
playing stud poker.

183
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,377
Yet somehow,
Rachel managed to slip past them.

184
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:41,087
Why?

185
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:43,798
How? She turns invisible?

186
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,759
Doctor, we're gonna need access
to the personnel files

187
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:47,885
of all the medical staff.

188
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,763
The nurses, the guards, the orderlies,
anyone who was working then.

189
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:53,641
We'll take your request
under consideration.

190
00:14:53,725 --> 00:14:56,352
This is not a request, Doctor.

191
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,938
This is a federal facility,
and a dangerous prisoner...

192
00:14:59,022 --> 00:15:01,232
- Patient.
...patient

193
00:15:01,316 --> 00:15:03,609
has escaped. Now, you will comply or...

194
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,028
All I can say is I'll see what I can do.

195
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:08,948
Doctor, we're gonna need
to speak with the staff.

196
00:15:09,032 --> 00:15:11,075
Do you understand?

197
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,369
I'll assemble them in the common room
after dinner.

198
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:15,746
If you have any further questions,

199
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:19,125
feel free to join the deputy warden
in the search.

200
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:34,891
It's 11 miles to the nearest land
and the water's freezing.

201
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:38,019
Current was strong last night,
tide pushing in.

202
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,687
She'd have drowned
or been crushed on the rocks,

203
00:15:39,771 --> 00:15:42,940
and her body would have
washed back up on shore.

204
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:49,155
What about those caves down there?
Have you checked them?

205
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:51,616
No way she could get there.

206
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,494
The bases of those cliffs
are covered in poison ivy,

207
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:58,623
live oak, sumac, a thousand plants
with thorns as big as my dick.

208
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:02,585
You said yourself, Marshal,
she's got no shoes.

209
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:10,593
All right, let's check the other side.

210
00:16:15,974 --> 00:16:18,935
- What's that tower?
- It's an old lighthouse.

211
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:22,396
The guards already searched inside it.

212
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,526
What's in there? More patients?

213
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,736
Sewage treatment facility.

214
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:33,115
It's getting dark soon.
I'm calling this off for tonight.

215
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,742
Let's go, boys!

216
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:40,540
You were on watch on the landing, huh?

217
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:44,043
Yeah. Couldn't nobody get in or out
of their room on that corridor

218
00:16:44,127 --> 00:16:45,878
without me seeing.

219
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:50,675
Okay, Rachel Solando, who else does
she have to pass to get down here?

220
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,559
Me. Glen Miga.

221
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,395
Sir, I didn't see nothing.

222
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,814
And you were at your post all night?

223
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:07,233
Yeah, but I didn't see a thing.

224
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:13,281
Glen.

225
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,868
Tell me the truth.

226
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,288
I...

227
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:24,584
I maybe went to the bathroom.

228
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:27,753
What? You breached protocol. Christ...

229
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:30,172
I wasn't gone more than a minute.

230
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:33,259
All right, look. Let's back up here.
Let's all just back up.

231
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:36,762
Miss Solando was put in her room
for lights out.

232
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:40,266
Does anyone here know
what she did before that?

233
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,559
Anyone?

234
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:45,479
Come on, anyone,
anyone, anyone, anyone.

235
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:48,065
She was in a group therapy session.

236
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:51,444
Anything unusual occur?

237
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,738
Define "unusual."

238
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,281
Excuse me?

239
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:59,744
This is a mental institution, Marshal,
for the criminally insane.

240
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:02,371
Usual isn't a big part of our day.

241
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,458
I will rephrase.

242
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:09,462
Did anything happen last night
during group therapy that was more,

243
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:12,048
let's say, I don't know,
memorable than...

244
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:13,883
- Normal?
- Exactly.

245
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,344
No. Sorry.

246
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,014
Did Miss Solando say anything
during group therapy?

247
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:23,184
She was worried about the rain.

248
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:27,730
And she hated the food here.
Complained constantly,

249
00:18:27,814 --> 00:18:29,565
last night included.

250
00:18:30,942 --> 00:18:34,070
So you were there.
Was there a doctor present?

251
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:37,490
Yes, Dr. Sheehan led the discussion.

252
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:39,950
Dr. Sheehan?

253
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,995
Yes, he was running the session.

254
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:48,834
He's Rachel's primary, the psychiatrist
who directly oversees her care.

255
00:18:51,129 --> 00:18:53,339
We're gonna need
to speak with Dr. Sheehan.

256
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:57,927
I'm afraid that won't be possible.
He left on the ferry this morning.

257
00:18:58,011 --> 00:19:01,347
His vacation was already planned.
He'd been putting it off too long.

258
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:06,185
You're in a state of lockdown,
a dangerous patient has escaped,

259
00:19:06,269 --> 00:19:10,439
and you let her primary doctor
leave on vacation?

260
00:19:11,274 --> 00:19:13,693
Well, of course. He's a doctor.

261
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:20,866
Do you have the phone number
for where he's gone?

262
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:23,244
Hello? Hello?

263
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:26,747
Hello?

264
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,125
Anybody there?

265
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:31,836
I'm sorry, sir, but it's all down.
All the lines.

266
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,796
The storm's hitting the mainland
like a hammer.

267
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,840
If you get it working,
come find me immediately.

268
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:38,384
The marshals need to make
an important call.

269
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:39,802
Yes, sir.

270
00:19:42,889 --> 00:19:45,850
Hello? Hello?

271
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:48,018
I'm afraid I have evening rounds
in the wards,

272
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:51,856
but I'll be having drinks and a cigar
at my house around 9:00,

273
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,941
if you'd care to drop by.

274
00:19:54,025 --> 00:19:56,318
Good. We can talk then, right?

275
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:00,781
We have been talking, Marshal.

276
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:20,551
Gotta say, I'm thinking
I got in the wrong line of public service.

277
00:20:20,635 --> 00:20:24,096
It is a little overwhelming.
It was constructed during the Civil War,

278
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:27,433
the same time as the military fort
housing Ward C.

279
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,776
This is the original
commander's quarters.

280
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:40,446
When Uncle Sam got the bill,
the commander was court-martialed.

281
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,573
I can see why.

282
00:20:42,657 --> 00:20:45,201
Nice music. Who is that? Brahms?

283
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:47,161
No.

284
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:58,714
- It's Mahler.
- Quite right, Marshal.

285
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:03,427
Forgive me, gentlemen.
My colleague, Dr. Jeremiah Naehring.

286
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:15,022
Quartet for Piano and Strings
in A minor.

287
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:20,152
Your poison, gentlemen?

288
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:23,239
- Rye, if you got it.
- Soda and ice, please. Thanks.

289
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:27,910
You don't indulge in alcohol?
I'm surprised.

290
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:32,915
Isn't it common for men
in your profession to imbibe?

291
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:36,252
Common enough. And yours?

292
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:39,046
I'm sorry?

293
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:42,007
- Your profession, Doctor. Psychiatry.
- Yes.

294
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:45,553
I always heard it was overrun
with boozers and drunks.

295
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:48,430
Not that I've noticed.

296
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:51,642
What's that?
Iced tea in your glass, there?

297
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:54,353
Excellent, Marshal.

298
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:57,606
You have outstanding
defense mechanisms.

299
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:02,027
You must be quite adept
at interrogations, hmm?

300
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:13,497
Men like you are my specialty,
you know?

301
00:22:14,165 --> 00:22:15,875
Men of violence.

302
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,835
Now that's a hell of an assumption
to make.

303
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,545
No assumption. No, not at all.

304
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:23,674
You misunderstand me.
I said you are men of violence.

305
00:22:23,758 --> 00:22:26,886
I'm not accusing you
of being violent men.

306
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:27,970
That's quite different.

307
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,890
No, please. Please. Edify us, Doctor.

308
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:35,561
You both served overseas, huh?

309
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:36,896
It's not much of a stretch, Doc.

310
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:40,482
For all you know,
we were both paper pushers over there.

311
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:42,026
No, you were not.

312
00:22:58,126 --> 00:22:59,126
Since the schoolyard,

313
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:03,255
neither of you has ever walked away
from a physical conflict.

314
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,507
No, no, not because you enjoy it,

315
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:09,470
but because retreat isn't something
you consider an option.

316
00:23:09,804 --> 00:23:11,472
We weren't raised to run, Doc.

317
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:14,683
Yes. "Raised."

318
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:19,021
And who raised you, Marshal?

319
00:23:19,522 --> 00:23:20,689
Me?

320
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:23,192
Wolves.

321
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:29,031
Very impressive defense mechanisms.

322
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,217
Do you believe in God, Marshal?

323
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:38,350
No, I'm quite serious.

324
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:46,942
You ever seen a death camp, Doctor?

325
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:04,334
His English really is very good.

326
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:07,254
You hit the consonants
a tad hard, though.

327
00:25:08,339 --> 00:25:10,007
You're a German?

328
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:13,218
Is legal immigration a crime, Marshal?

329
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:15,721
I don't know, Doctor. You tell us.

330
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:19,224
Now, listen.

331
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:21,226
We're gonna need those files
on Sheehan

332
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:23,103
and the rest of the staff as well.

333
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:26,315
No personnel files will
be released to you. Period.

334
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:29,485
- We're gonna need those files.
- Out of the question.

335
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:31,070
Bullshit, out of the question!

336
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:32,237
Bullshit!

337
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:35,115
Just who the hell's in charge here,
anyway, huh?

338
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,744
Dr. Naehring acts as liaison
to our Board of Overseers.

339
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:40,996
He relayed your request,
and it's been refused.

340
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:44,416
Refused? They don't have the authority
to refuse, and neither do you, sir.

341
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:48,212
Marshal, continue your investigation
and we'll do all we can to help.

342
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:49,880
This investigation is over.

343
00:25:49,964 --> 00:25:52,257
We're gonna file our reports
and we're gonna hand it over to...

344
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:54,843
- Hoover's boys.
- Hoover's boys. That's right.

345
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:58,680
We'll be taking the ferry back
in the morning. Come on, Chuck.

346
00:26:07,273 --> 00:26:08,690
Nice night.

347
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:17,699
You'll be bunking
in the orderlies' quarters.

348
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,838
Hey, boss.

349
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:33,549
We really packing it in?

350
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:35,342
Why?

351
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:40,180
I guess... I don't know,
I just never really quit anything before.

352
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:43,433
We haven't heard the truth
once yet, Chuck.

353
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:47,771
Listen, Rachel Solando didn't slip out
of a locked cell, barefoot,

354
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,064
without any help.

355
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:52,776
I think she had a lot of help.

356
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:55,445
Maybe Cawley's sitting up
in his mansion right now

357
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,823
rethinking his whole attitude.

358
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:02,369
- Maybe, in the morning, we'll be...
- You're bluffing?

359
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:04,621
I didn't say that.

360
00:27:23,057 --> 00:27:25,684
I found a whole stack of these, Teddy.

361
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:28,812
Jesus, are you ever sober anymore?

362
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:32,608
I killed a lot of people in the war.

363
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,236
Is that why you drink?

364
00:27:39,073 --> 00:27:40,574
Are you real?

365
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:42,784
No.

366
00:27:46,789 --> 00:27:48,457
She's still here.

367
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:50,459
Who?

368
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:52,794
Rachel?

369
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:55,672
She never left.

370
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:13,190
Remember when we stayed
in the cabin in the summer, Teddy?

371
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:15,692
We were so happy.

372
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,529
She's here.

373
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:21,573
You can't leave.

374
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,255
I'm not gonna leave.

375
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,508
I love you so much.

376
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:46,431
I'm just bones in a box, Teddy.

377
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:47,557
No.

378
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,519
I am.

379
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,315
You have to wake up.

380
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:58,694
I won't go.

381
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:01,280
You're here.

382
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:07,077
I'm not. You have to face that.

383
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,748
But she is.

384
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,377
So is he.

385
00:29:17,463 --> 00:29:18,672
Who?

386
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:22,509
Laeddis.

387
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:29,141
- I have to go.
- No.

388
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:33,895
No, please. Please.
I need to hold on to you.

389
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:37,232
- Just a little bit longer, please.
- Oh, God, Teddy.

390
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:39,318
You have to let me go.

391
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:42,112
I can't.

392
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:16,229
Ain't gonna be no ferry in this shit.

393
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,444
Doctor!

394
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:24,654
Doctor, Doctor.

395
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:27,741
We need to interview the patients who
were in Rachel's group therapy session.

396
00:30:27,825 --> 00:30:29,743
I thought your investigation was finished.

397
00:30:29,827 --> 00:30:32,788
Well, it's not like
we could take the ferry.

398
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:36,917
Now, was Rachel receiving
any other treatments for her illnesses?

399
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:41,046
Do you know the state of the mental
health field these days, gentlemen?

400
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:43,298
No, not a clue, Doctor.

401
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:44,716
War.

402
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:47,552
The old school believes
in surgical intervention.

403
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:49,137
Psychosurgery.

404
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:52,182
Procedures like
the transorbital lobotomy.

405
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:56,603
Some say the patients
become reasonable, docile.

406
00:30:56,687 --> 00:30:58,980
Others say they become zombies.

407
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:01,233
- And the new school?
- Psychopharmacology.

408
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:03,568
A new drug has just been approved
called Thorazine,

409
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:06,822
which relaxes psychotic patients,
you could say tames them.

410
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:08,240
And which school are you, Doctor?

411
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:12,869
Me? I have this radical idea that
if you treat a patient with respect,

412
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:17,082
listen to him, try and understand,
you just might reach him.

413
00:31:20,002 --> 00:31:23,004
Come on, Marge. It's okay.

414
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:25,966
- These patients, huh?
- Even these.

415
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,468
What should be a last resort
is becoming a first response.

416
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:32,431
Give them a pill, put them in a corner,
it all goes away.

417
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:34,766
Rachel Solando was on
a combination of drugs

418
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:36,768
meant to keep her
from becoming violent,

419
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:39,938
but it was only intermittently effective.

420
00:31:40,022 --> 00:31:41,648
The greatest obstacle to her recovery

421
00:31:41,732 --> 00:31:44,693
was her refusal
to face what she had done.

422
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:46,695
"Was."

423
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:52,117
Is there a reason you keep referring to
your patient in the past tense, Doctor?

424
00:31:54,745 --> 00:31:58,248
Look outside, Marshal.
Why do you think?

425
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:06,798
Next up is Peter Breene.

426
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:09,217
Assaulted his father's nurse
with broken glass.

427
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:12,846
Nurse survived,
but her face is permanently disfigured.

428
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:14,389
I can't wait.

429
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:20,645
She'd smile at me. She was so sweet,
but you could see it in her eyes.

430
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:24,107
She liked to be naked, to suck cock.

431
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:27,235
Okay, Mr. Breene.

432
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:31,281
And then she asked me
if she can have a glass of water?

433
00:32:31,365 --> 00:32:34,534
Alone, in the kitchen,
like that's no big deal?

434
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:38,580
- Well, why was that a big deal?
- It was obvious.

435
00:32:38,664 --> 00:32:42,876
She wanted me to pull out my thing
so that she could laugh at it.

436
00:32:44,962 --> 00:32:46,421
Mr. Breene.

437
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:50,592
We need to ask you
some questions, okay?

438
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:55,013
When I cut her, she screamed.

439
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:59,643
But she scared me.

440
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:03,939
- What did she expect?
- Interesting.

441
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:08,568
But we're here
to talk about Rachel Solando, okay?

442
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,695
Rachel Solando. Do you...

443
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,031
Do you know that
she drowned her own kids?

444
00:33:13,115 --> 00:33:15,242
She drowned her kids!

445
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:18,370
This is... This is a sick fucking world
we live in, I'll tell you that.

446
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:20,205
But you know what?
They should be gassed.

447
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:24,543
All of them.
The retards, the killers, the niggers.

448
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:27,295
You kill your own kid, gas the bitch.

449
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:32,467
Could you stop that?

450
00:33:34,011 --> 00:33:36,388
- That nurse...
- Please, stop that.

451
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:39,558
That nurse, maybe she had kids, huh?

452
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:42,894
A husband.

453
00:33:44,021 --> 00:33:46,356
Just trying to make ends meet,

454
00:33:47,733 --> 00:33:50,026
lead a normal life.

455
00:33:51,028 --> 00:33:53,280
It says in your file that

456
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,825
you tore her face off. Didn't you?

457
00:33:58,327 --> 00:33:59,286
Congratulations.

458
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:02,289
No more normal for her,
not ever again. No.

459
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:06,751
Do you know what she was afraid of?

460
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:10,589
You.

461
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:12,924
Could you stop that? Please?

462
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:16,303
Stop that!

463
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:18,597
Please! Stop!

464
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:20,849
Do you know a patient
named Andrew Laeddis? Do you?

465
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:22,142
No! No.

466
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,269
- Boss. What's up?
- Fine.

467
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:26,354
- I wanna go back. I wanna go.
- Peter!

468
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:30,066
Come on! I got him. Peter! Peter!
Hey, Peter!

469
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:31,484
Go back.

470
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:32,944
- I wanna go back.
- Come on, Peter.

471
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:34,154
- I don't wanna see him.
- Easy now.

472
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:37,032
- I don't wanna see him anymore.
- It's okay. It's all right.

473
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:46,875
Oh, I'll never get out of here.
I'm not sure that I should.

474
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:51,212
Excuse me for saying this,
Miss Kearns...

475
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:54,049
- Mrs.
- Mrs. Kearns.

476
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:58,637
But you seem quite normal.

477
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:01,931
I mean, in comparison
to the other patients here.

478
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:05,644
Well, I have my dark days.
I suppose everybody does.

479
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:11,066
The difference is most people
don't kill their husbands with an ax.

480
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:15,153
Although, personally,
I think if a man beats you

481
00:35:15,237 --> 00:35:20,075
and fucks half the women he sees,
and no one will help you,

482
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:24,579
axing him isn't the least
understandable thing you could do.

483
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:27,540
Maybe you shouldn't get out.

484
00:35:29,126 --> 00:35:33,505
What would I do if I did?
I don't know the world anymore.

485
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:38,301
They say there are bombs
that can reduce whole cities to ash.

486
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:43,723
And what do you call them, televisions,
voices and faces coming from a box.

487
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,976
I hear enough voices already.

488
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:50,105
What can you tell us about Rachel?

489
00:35:52,983 --> 00:35:56,194
Not much. She keeps to herself.

490
00:35:56,278 --> 00:35:59,698
She believed her kids were alive.

491
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:02,826
She thought she was still living
in the Berkshires,

492
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:07,872
and we were all her neighbors,
the milkmen, postmen...

493
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:09,499
Deliverymen.

494
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:13,128
And Dr. Sheehan was there that night?

495
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:16,798
Yes. He talked about anger.

496
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:22,762
Tell me about him. What's he like?

497
00:36:25,307 --> 00:36:29,978
He's okay. Nice.

498
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:34,983
Not hard on the eyes,
as my mother would say.

499
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:40,697
- Did he ever make a pass at you?
- No.

500
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:45,160
No, Dr. Sheehan's a good doctor,
he would never...

501
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:50,832
Could I have a glass of water, please?

502
00:36:50,916 --> 00:36:52,333
No problem.

503
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:09,517
- Thank you, Marshal.
- Sure.

504
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:16,608
I just have one more question for you,
Mrs. Kearns.

505
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:23,156
Did you ever meet a patient
named Andrew Laeddis?

506
00:37:26,243 --> 00:37:27,410
No.

507
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:30,622
Never heard of him.

508
00:37:36,378 --> 00:37:37,545
She was coached.

509
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:40,715
She used practically the same words
as Cawley and the nurse,

510
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,300
like she'd been told exactly what to say.

511
00:37:42,384 --> 00:37:44,219
Who's Andrew Laeddis?

512
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:53,144
You asked every one of those patients
back there about him. Who is he?

513
00:37:56,982 --> 00:38:00,443
What the hell, boss?
I'm your partner, for Christ's sake.

514
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:02,403
We just met, Chuck.

515
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:06,407
You've been on the beat for a long time.
You've got a duty. You've got a career.

516
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:10,912
What I'm doing,
it's not exactly by the book.

517
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:15,124
I don't give a damn
about by-the-book, boss.

518
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:18,086
I just wanna know
what the hell's going on.

519
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:24,968
When this case came over the wires,

520
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:28,847
I requested it specifically,
you understand?

521
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:30,473
Why?

522
00:38:32,726 --> 00:38:34,435
Andrew Laeddis,

523
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:37,438
he was the maintenance man
in the apartment building

524
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:39,691
where my wife and I lived.

525
00:38:40,734 --> 00:38:41,985
Okay.

526
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,864
He was also a firebug.

527
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:51,286
Andrew Laeddis lit the match

528
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:56,958
that caused the fire that killed my wife.

529
00:39:05,175 --> 00:39:06,634
Let them out!

530
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:12,640
- What happened to Laeddis?
- He got away with it.

531
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:15,143
Laeddis got away with it
and then he disappeared.

532
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:18,229
About a year ago, I open up the paper
and there he is.

533
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:22,817
Ugly-looking son of a bitch. Huge scar
from his right temple down to his left lip.

534
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:26,362
Eyes different colors.
Not the type of face you'd forget.

535
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:29,574
He burned down a schoolhouse,
killed two people,

536
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:31,409
said voices told him to do it.

537
00:39:31,493 --> 00:39:34,120
First he went to prison,
then he got transferred here.

538
00:39:34,204 --> 00:39:36,414
- Then what?
- Then nothing.

539
00:39:36,498 --> 00:39:40,251
He vanished like he never existed.
No record whatsoever.

540
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:42,712
Pretty sure he's not in Ward B.
That leaves Ward C.

541
00:39:42,796 --> 00:39:44,088
Or he could be dead.

542
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:46,758
So could Rachel Solando,
for that matter.

543
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:49,427
Lot of places to hide a body here.

544
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:53,139
Only one place
no one would really notice.

545
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:08,780
That patient, Bridget Kearns,
when she sent me for water,

546
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:11,783
she said something to you back there,
didn't she?

547
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:12,992
No.

548
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:16,204
Come on, boss.

549
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,626
She wrote it.

550
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:38,226
Boss!

551
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:42,146
We gotta get indoors. It's turning
into a fucking Kansas out here.

552
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:44,482
- Hold on.
- No, let's go!

553
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:48,820
Watch out!

554
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:52,156
Jesus!

555
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:56,202
- Come on! Up there!
- Let's go!

556
00:40:58,872 --> 00:41:00,832
Get in there! Let's go!

557
00:41:04,461 --> 00:41:05,670
Boss!

558
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:14,804
- God!
- Jesus Christ!

559
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,099
Damn it. God!

560
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:30,069
- You okay, boss?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

561
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:41,330
So if Laeddis is here,
what are you gonna do about it?

562
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:46,669
I'm not here to kill Laeddis.

563
00:41:54,344 --> 00:41:56,095
If it was my wife, I'd kill him.

564
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,180
Twice.

565
00:42:07,941 --> 00:42:12,570
When we got through the gates
at Dachau, the SS guards surrendered.

566
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:26,834
The Kommandant tried to kill himself
before we got there, but he...

567
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:29,295
He botched it.

568
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:32,840
Took him an hour to die.

569
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:41,682
When I went outside,
I saw all the bodies on the ground.

570
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:47,855
Too many to count.

571
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:16,384
Too many to imagine.

572
00:43:19,012 --> 00:43:20,721
So, yeah, the...

573
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:24,809
The guards surrendered,
we took their guns,

574
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:26,811
and we lined them up.

575
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:13,149
It wasn't warfare. It was...

576
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:16,694
It was murder.

577
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:23,117
Yeah, I've had enough of killing.

578
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:27,622
That's not why I'm here.

579
00:44:28,665 --> 00:44:30,708
So what is this all about?

580
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:38,633
After Laeddis vanished, I started doing
some checking on Ashecliffe.

581
00:44:40,135 --> 00:44:43,221
A lot of people know about this place,
but no one wants to talk.

582
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:47,266
You know, it's like it...
It's like they're scared or something.

583
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:52,396
You know, this place is funded
by a special grant

584
00:44:53,315 --> 00:44:56,150
from The House
Un-American Activities Committee?

585
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:59,403
HUAC? And how exactly
are we fighting the communists

586
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:01,822
from an island in Boston Harbor?

587
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:05,076
By conducting experiments on the mind.

588
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:07,954
At least that's my guess.

589
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:09,747
And you think that's going on here?

590
00:45:09,831 --> 00:45:12,333
Like I said, no one would talk, right?

591
00:45:12,417 --> 00:45:15,086
Till I found somebody
who used to be a patient here.

592
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:19,548
Guy's name is George Noyce.
Nice college kid. Socialist.

593
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:21,676
He gets offered some money
to do a psych study.

594
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,135
Guess what they were testing?

595
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,303
Toothpaste.

596
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:26,764
So, he starts
seeing dragons everywhere.

597
00:45:26,848 --> 00:45:31,852
He almost beats his professor to death.
Ends up here in Ashecliffe, Ward C.

598
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:35,982
They release him after one year, right?
And what does he do?

599
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:40,987
Two weeks on the mainland, he walks
into a bar, stabs three men to death.

600
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:46,492
His lawyer pleads insanity, but Noyce,
he stands up in the courtroom and he...

601
00:45:46,576 --> 00:45:51,038
He begs the judge for the electric chair.
Anywhere but a mental hospital.

602
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:54,250
Judge gives him life in Dedham Prison.

603
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:56,335
And you found him.

604
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,087
Yeah, I found him.

605
00:45:58,171 --> 00:46:00,673
Well, he's a mess.

606
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:04,385
But it's pretty clear
from what he tells me.

607
00:46:04,469 --> 00:46:05,594
What?

608
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:08,431
They're experimenting on people here.

609
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:10,224
I don't know, boss.

610
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:13,019
How do you believe a crazy guy?

611
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:14,770
That's the beauty of it, isn't it?

612
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:19,108
Crazy people, they're the perfect
subjects. They talk, nobody listens.

613
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:21,360
I stood at Dachau.

614
00:46:21,611 --> 00:46:26,282
We saw what human beings are
capable of doing to each other, right?

615
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:28,951
For Christ's sakes, we fought
a goddamn war to stop them,

616
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:32,788
and now... Now I find out it may be
happening here? On our soil?

617
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:33,914
No.

618
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:37,710
So what are you really here to do, Ted?

619
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:42,214
I'm gonna get the proof,
I'm gonna go back,

620
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:45,968
and I'm gonna blow the lid off this place.
That's it.

621
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:48,888
Wait a minute.

622
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:52,266
You started asking around
about Ashecliffe,

623
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:53,768
waiting for a chance to get out here,

624
00:46:53,852 --> 00:46:56,437
and then suddenly
they need a U.S. Marshal?

625
00:46:56,521 --> 00:47:00,399
Yeah, I got lucky. There was a patient
escape. It was the perfect excuse.

626
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:03,486
No, no, no, boss.
Luck doesn't work that way.

627
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:05,237
The world doesn't work that way.

628
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:08,616
They got an electrified fence
around a septic facility.

629
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,827
Ward C is inside a Civil War fort?

630
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:15,581
A Chief of Staff with ties to the OSS?
Funding from HUAC?

631
00:47:15,665 --> 00:47:20,252
I mean, Jesus Christ, everything about
this place stinks of government ops.

632
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:21,712
What if they wanted you here?

633
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:23,672
- Bullshit.
- You were asking questions.

634
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:24,799
- Bullshit! Bullshit!
- Bullshit.

635
00:47:24,883 --> 00:47:26,133
We came here for Rachel Solando.

636
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:29,095
Where's one shred of evidence
she even existed?

637
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:30,346
There's no way they could've known

638
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:31,806
I'd be assigned to this case.
There's no way.

639
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:35,226
What if while you were looking into
them, they were looking into you?

640
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:38,521
All they had to do was fake an escape
to get you here, and now they have you.

641
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:40,398
Now they have us both. Here! Now!

642
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:48,989
Marshals, are you out here?
This is Deputy Warden McPherson.

643
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:51,158
Marshals!

644
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:53,244
How about that? They found us, huh?

645
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:55,830
It's an island, boss.
They're always gonna find us.

646
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:58,833
I know you're in there.

647
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:03,921
We're getting off this goddamn island.
You and me. Come on.

648
00:48:08,301 --> 00:48:10,010
- Come on!
- Go, go!

649
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:22,940
Get dried off.
Dr. Cawley wants to talk to you now.

650
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:27,111
And hurry up! This thing is turning
into a goddamn hurricane!

651
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:36,203
I dropped those suits off to be cleaned.
Should be ready by tomorrow.

652
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:39,498
That is, if we all don't wash away first.

653
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:44,044
You know, speaking of which, I'm afraid
your smokes are pretty much done for.

654
00:48:44,629 --> 00:48:45,796
So...

655
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:49,592
This is our only choice, huh?

656
00:48:49,676 --> 00:48:52,720
Got something really nice in
a prison gray if that don't work for you.

657
00:48:52,804 --> 00:48:55,723
Now that you mention it,
these are just fine.

658
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:58,058
That's why I must repeat my insistence

659
00:48:58,143 --> 00:49:01,270
that all Ward C patients
be placed in manual restraints.

660
00:49:01,938 --> 00:49:05,274
If the facility floods, they'll drown.
You know that.

661
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:06,984
That would take a lot of flooding.

662
00:49:07,068 --> 00:49:09,737
We're on an island in the middle
of the ocean during a hurricane.

663
00:49:09,821 --> 00:49:12,490
A lot of flooding seems like
a distinct possibility.

664
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:14,909
It's a gamble, Stephen.
Say the power fails.

665
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:16,243
There's a backup generator.

666
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:19,038
And if that goes,
the cell doors will open.

667
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:22,249
Where are they going to go?

668
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:25,920
They can't just hop a ferry, scoot over
to the mainland and wreak havoc.

669
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:27,004
Oh, you're quite right.

670
00:49:27,088 --> 00:49:30,257
They're far more likely
to wreak havoc right here on us.

671
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:34,094
If they're manacled to the floor,
they'll die.

672
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:36,305
This is 24 human beings.

673
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:38,265
And you can live with that, can you?

674
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:40,434
Well, frankly, if it were up to me,

675
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:43,854
I'd put all 42 in Wards A and B
in manual restraints as well.

676
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:46,815
- Excuse me! Excuse me.
- Marshal.

677
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:49,443
I'm sorry, Doctor.
I just have one quick question.

678
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:50,736
Yes, I'll be with you in a moment.

679
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:53,822
When we spoke this morning
about Rachel Solando's note...

680
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:55,616
"The law of four." I love that.

681
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:59,245
...you said you had no idea what that
second line could refer to, correct?

682
00:50:00,413 --> 00:50:04,750
"Who is 67?" Yes, I'm afraid I still don't.
None of us do.

683
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:07,419
Nothing comes to mind?

684
00:50:10,131 --> 00:50:11,340
Nothing?

685
00:50:15,303 --> 00:50:20,349
Because I believe I just heard you say
there are 24 patients in Ward C

686
00:50:20,433 --> 00:50:22,893
and 42 patients in Wards A and B,

687
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:26,438
which means there's a total of,
what, 66 patients at this facility?

688
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:29,108
That is correct, yes.

689
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:35,656
Well, it seems to me
Rachel Solando was suggesting

690
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:38,867
that you have a 67th patient, Doctor.

691
00:50:40,453 --> 00:50:41,954
But I'm afraid we don't.

692
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:44,415
This is ridiculous.
What are they doing here?

693
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:46,667
We're doing our goddamn job.

694
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:49,670
Didn't McPherson tell you
the good news?

695
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:53,257
No. What's the good news, Doctor?

696
00:50:53,341 --> 00:50:55,092
Rachel's been found.

697
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:57,511
She's here.

698
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,180
Safe and sound.

699
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:13,902
There's not a mark on her.

700
00:51:17,532 --> 00:51:18,949
Who are these men?

701
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:23,912
Why are they in my house?

702
00:51:23,997 --> 00:51:28,500
Police officers, Rachel.
They have a few questions.

703
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:33,213
Ma'am.

704
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:41,180
There has been a sighting of a known
communist subversive in this area,

705
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:43,182
passing out literature.

706
00:51:44,976 --> 00:51:46,185
Here?

707
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:50,022
In this neighborhood?

708
00:51:50,106 --> 00:51:51,857
Yes, I'm afraid so.

709
00:51:53,234 --> 00:51:56,820
Now if you could tell us what you did
yesterday, where you were,

710
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:59,031
it would really help us
narrow down our search.

711
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:01,909
Yes...

712
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:05,996
Well, I...

713
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:11,752
I made breakfast
for Jim and the children,

714
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:14,838
and then I

715
00:52:16,716 --> 00:52:18,926
packed Jim's lunch and he left.

716
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:25,265
Then I sent the children off to school.

717
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:30,938
And then

718
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:40,406
I decided to take a long swim
in the lake.

719
00:52:47,288 --> 00:52:48,497
I see.

720
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:53,752
And after that?

721
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:03,262
After that,

722
00:53:13,064 --> 00:53:14,690
I thought of you.

723
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:24,658
I'm sorry, ma'am,
I don't know what you're talking about.

724
00:53:27,662 --> 00:53:30,622
Don't you know how lonely
I've been, Jim?

725
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:37,671
You're gone.

726
00:53:41,926 --> 00:53:43,385
You're dead.

727
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:50,309
I cry every night.

728
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:58,525
How am I supposed to survive?

729
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:01,195
God.

730
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:14,875
Rachel, it'll be all right.

731
00:54:18,129 --> 00:54:20,172
I'm so sorry, but every...

732
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:24,718
Everything's gonna be all right. Okay?

733
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:28,096
I buried you.

734
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:33,060
I buried an empty casket.
Your body rained down,

735
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:36,647
lumps of flesh splashing into the sea,
eaten by sharks.

736
00:54:40,902 --> 00:54:43,529
My Jim's dead,
so who the fuck are you?

737
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:48,617
Who the fuck are you?

738
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:50,494
- Who are you?
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

739
00:54:50,578 --> 00:54:52,162
- Who are you?
- It's okay. Rachel. Rachel, it's all right.

740
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:54,748
Let me go! No!

741
00:54:56,417 --> 00:54:58,544
- Rachel, it's okay.
- Look at me, look at me.

742
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:04,758
I'm sorry about that.
I didn't want to interrupt.

743
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:07,177
I thought she might tell you something.

744
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:11,181
We found her down by the lighthouse,
skipping stones.

745
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:13,433
We've no idea how she got out, but...

746
00:55:13,518 --> 00:55:15,894
I'm gonna have to ask you
to go down into the basement.

747
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:17,938
There's food, water and cots.

748
00:55:18,022 --> 00:55:21,275
It's the safest place to be
when the hurricane hits.

749
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:27,781
Are you all right? You look pale.

750
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:29,658
I'm fine. It's just...

751
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:32,703
Boss, are you okay?

752
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:36,290
It's just so goddamn bright, isn't it?

753
00:55:36,374 --> 00:55:38,542
Photosensitivity, headaches sometimes.

754
00:55:38,626 --> 00:55:40,711
Marshal, are you having a migraine?

755
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:42,462
I'll be all right.

756
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:46,800
Come on, I got you.

757
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:50,220
What's wrong with him?

758
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:52,723
Take these, Marshal. Couple of hours,
you'll be as clear as a bell.

759
00:55:52,807 --> 00:55:54,808
- What's wrong with him?
- He's having a migraine.

760
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:57,185
Imagine someone sawed open
your head, filled it with razors,

761
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:59,980
and shook it as hard as they could.
Take the pills, Marshal.

762
00:56:00,064 --> 00:56:02,190
- I don't... I don't want the pills.
- It'll stop the pain.

763
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:04,192
Marshal, take the pills.

764
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:10,157
He's going to need to lie down.

765
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:16,788
Oh, my God!

766
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:18,206
Michael, there's broken glass
all over the floor.

767
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:19,875
- Make sure all the meds are locked up.
- Watch your back.

768
00:56:19,959 --> 00:56:20,959
Make sure everything's okay in Ward B.

769
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:22,544
Go down to the infirmary
and see if there's any more...

770
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:23,754
All right, Doctor.

771
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:27,633
Give him a bed. This one here.

772
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:31,303
- Over here. All right, boss.
- Yeah, that's it.

773
00:56:31,387 --> 00:56:32,471
- You have him?
- Yes.

774
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:33,805
Careful. All right.

775
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:39,645
Could be worse right now.
He'll be all right.

776
00:56:44,692 --> 00:56:46,109
Who is that?

777
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:48,695
Him? That's the warden.

778
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:53,450
Don't you worry about him, all right?

779
00:56:53,534 --> 00:56:55,661
Come on. Lay back. Lay back.

780
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:03,168
He looks like an ex-military prick, huh?

781
00:57:03,252 --> 00:57:05,212
Well, you know what?
I ain't gonna argue with you on that one.

782
00:58:31,549 --> 00:58:33,967
You should have saved me.

783
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:38,263
You should have saved all of us.

784
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:09,044
Hey, buddy.

785
00:59:11,297 --> 00:59:12,547
Hey.

786
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:13,924
Laeddis.

787
00:59:15,551 --> 00:59:16,718
Yeah.

788
00:59:22,016 --> 00:59:23,100
My...

789
00:59:27,605 --> 00:59:28,688
My buddy.

790
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:32,150
No hard feelings, right?

791
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:37,155
Yeah.

792
00:59:38,699 --> 00:59:40,367
No hard feelings.

793
00:59:53,798 --> 00:59:56,007
A little something for later,

794
00:59:59,512 --> 01:00:02,097
'cause I know how much you need it.

795
01:00:08,312 --> 01:00:12,357
The clock's ticking, my friend.
We're running out of time.

796
01:00:23,202 --> 01:00:24,953
Give me a hand here.

797
01:00:47,226 --> 01:00:48,727
I could get into trouble.

798
01:01:17,131 --> 01:01:18,465
I'm dead.

799
01:01:21,427 --> 01:01:22,969
I'm so sorry.

800
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:26,640
Why didn't you save me?

801
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:33,271
I tried. I wanted to, but by the time
I got there, it was too late.

802
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:56,503
See?

803
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:01,675
Aren't they beautiful?

804
01:02:56,439 --> 01:02:58,523
Why are you all wet, baby?

805
01:03:01,235 --> 01:03:02,902
Laeddis isn't dead.

806
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,780
He isn't gone.

807
01:03:06,991 --> 01:03:08,575
He's still here.

808
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:12,078
I know.

809
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:17,417
You need to find him, Teddy. You need
to find him and you kill him dead.

810
01:03:35,269 --> 01:03:36,478
It's okay.

811
01:03:46,447 --> 01:03:49,199
- Security to Ward A. Okay.
- Ward A. I got it.

812
01:03:49,283 --> 01:03:51,284
The generator room's flooded.

813
01:03:51,369 --> 01:03:53,620
- Ward A. Ward A.
- See what we need in Ward B.

814
01:03:53,996 --> 01:03:55,205
Let's go.

815
01:03:55,539 --> 01:03:57,082
You okay, boss?

816
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:01,711
This goddamn migraine.

817
01:04:01,796 --> 01:04:05,673
The backup generator's failed.
The whole place has gone crazy.

818
01:04:07,426 --> 01:04:08,676
What do you want to do?

819
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:18,061
- Christ.
- Dan? Relax. Nope, nope, nope.

820
01:04:18,145 --> 01:04:20,563
You don't wanna do that. Put it down.
Now. Put it down.

821
01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:24,234
Grab him, grab him, grab him, grab him!
Get him, get him!

822
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:31,282
You need to go find him
'cause he needs to be here.

823
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:33,910
You think the whole electrical system
is fried?

824
01:04:33,994 --> 01:04:36,746
I'd say it's a good possibility, yeah.

825
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:39,874
- All the electronic security, the fences...
- Why are you always running?

826
01:04:39,959 --> 01:04:43,128
...the gates, the doors.
- Why is it you every time? Come on.

827
01:04:43,212 --> 01:04:47,173
Nice day for a stroll, don't you think?
To Ward C, for example.

828
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:52,846
- Come on.
- Maybe we'll run into Andrew Laeddis.

829
01:04:57,852 --> 01:05:00,812
The guy I told you about,
George Noyce?

830
01:05:00,896 --> 01:05:03,606
He told me this is where
they keep the worst ones.

831
01:05:03,691 --> 01:05:06,317
Guys even the other inmates
are scared of.

832
01:05:08,195 --> 01:05:10,488
Did Noyce give you anything
on the layout?

833
01:05:10,573 --> 01:05:14,325
Not really. All he remembered was
people screaming day and night,

834
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:17,120
no windows and iron bars everywhere.

835
01:05:17,204 --> 01:05:18,371
Watch your head!

836
01:05:38,392 --> 01:05:40,393
- Oh, Jesus Christ!
- Jesus.

837
01:05:40,978 --> 01:05:43,021
First time on Ward C, huh?

838
01:05:44,064 --> 01:05:45,773
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah.

839
01:05:45,858 --> 01:05:46,900
We heard stories, but...

840
01:05:46,984 --> 01:05:49,611
Trust me, son, you haven't heard shit.

841
01:05:50,070 --> 01:05:52,238
We got most of the bugsies
locked down now,

842
01:05:52,573 --> 01:05:54,491
but some of them are still loose.

843
01:05:54,575 --> 01:05:57,285
And if you see one,
don't try to restrain him yourselves.

844
01:05:57,369 --> 01:05:59,746
These fuckers will kill you. Clear?

845
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:03,750
All right, get your asses moving then.
Go on.

846
01:07:00,474 --> 01:07:01,808
He's here.

847
01:07:05,813 --> 01:07:09,232
Laeddis. I can feel him.

848
01:07:13,487 --> 01:07:15,238
Tag! You're it!

849
01:07:15,322 --> 01:07:17,323
Wait! Boss! Ted!

850
01:07:26,875 --> 01:07:28,543
Hey! Hey!

851
01:07:30,004 --> 01:07:31,170
Teddy.

852
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:14,589
Listen to me.

853
01:08:15,674 --> 01:08:18,593
Listen, I don't wanna leave here,
all right?

854
01:08:19,053 --> 01:08:21,262
I mean, why would anybody want to?

855
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:24,807
We hear things here
about the outside world.

856
01:08:24,892 --> 01:08:28,311
- About atolls, about H-bomb tests.
- Teddy, where are you?

857
01:08:28,395 --> 01:08:30,396
You know how a hydrogen bomb works?

858
01:08:30,481 --> 01:08:33,733
- I know. With hydrogen! With hydrogen.
- Ah, that's funny.

859
01:08:33,817 --> 01:08:36,736
- Boss!
- Other bombs explode, right?

860
01:08:37,571 --> 01:08:39,155
But not the hydrogen bomb.

861
01:08:39,239 --> 01:08:44,702
It implodes, creating an explosion
to the thousandth, the millionth degree!

862
01:08:45,162 --> 01:08:46,788
- Do you get it?
- Yeah! Yeah.

863
01:08:46,872 --> 01:08:48,456
- Do you?
- I get it, I get it!

864
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:49,791
Let him go!

865
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:54,504
No!

866
01:09:03,764 --> 01:09:05,765
No! No!

867
01:09:07,184 --> 01:09:08,935
What are you doing?

868
01:09:09,228 --> 01:09:11,938
Jesus Christ, Teddy. Jesus!

869
01:09:12,272 --> 01:09:16,109
Oh, you got Billings. What the fuck's
the matter with you guys?

870
01:09:16,193 --> 01:09:17,276
Catch them, not kill them!

871
01:09:17,361 --> 01:09:20,321
- He jumped us.
- You, give me a hand with him.

872
01:09:20,406 --> 01:09:22,824
We've gotta get him to the infirmary.
God damn it.

873
01:09:22,908 --> 01:09:26,619
No, no! Not you, not you.
Take a walk. Come on.

874
01:09:27,162 --> 01:09:29,622
Cawley's gonna have my goddamn balls
for this.

875
01:10:00,571 --> 01:10:24,594
Laeddis.

876
01:10:35,647 --> 01:10:37,398
Stop me, please,

877
01:10:38,317 --> 01:10:39,859
before I kill more.

878
01:10:41,862 --> 01:10:44,363
Stop me before I kill more.

879
01:10:44,782 --> 01:10:46,699
Laeddis.

880
01:10:54,792 --> 01:10:56,709
Please, please.

881
01:11:00,964 --> 01:11:02,924
I see you all.

882
01:11:03,675 --> 01:11:07,053
Laeddis.

883
01:11:13,393 --> 01:11:18,856
You told me I'd be free of this place.
You promised.

884
01:11:20,734 --> 01:11:22,193
You lied.

885
01:11:22,736 --> 01:11:24,070
Laeddis.

886
01:11:29,576 --> 01:11:30,910
Laeddis?

887
01:11:32,704 --> 01:11:34,413
That's pretty damn funny.

888
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:38,918
- Your voice.
- Don't you recognize it?

889
01:11:40,212 --> 01:11:42,338
After all the talks we had?

890
01:11:43,257 --> 01:11:45,299
After all the lies you told me?

891
01:11:45,384 --> 01:11:47,176
Let me see your face.

892
01:11:47,678 --> 01:11:49,637
They say I'm theirs now.

893
01:11:50,764 --> 01:11:53,099
They say I'll never leave here.

894
01:11:54,351 --> 01:11:56,519
Your match is about to go out.

895
01:11:59,106 --> 01:12:01,858
- Let me see your goddamn face! Now!
- Why?

896
01:12:02,276 --> 01:12:05,736
So you can lie to me more?
This isn't about the truth.

897
01:12:05,821 --> 01:12:09,574
- Yes, it is. It's about exposing the truth.
- It's about you!

898
01:12:10,784 --> 01:12:15,037
And Laeddis.
That's all it's ever been about.

899
01:12:16,665 --> 01:12:20,376
I was incidental. A way in.

900
01:12:23,714 --> 01:12:28,217
George... George Noyce. No.

901
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:31,012
It's not possible. You can't be here.

902
01:12:31,096 --> 01:12:32,471
You like it?

903
01:12:34,182 --> 01:12:36,100
Who did this to you, George?

904
01:12:36,184 --> 01:12:37,435
You did.

905
01:12:37,978 --> 01:12:39,395
What the hell do you mean?

906
01:12:39,479 --> 01:12:43,649
All your talk. All your fucking talk,
and I'm back in here because of you.

907
01:12:43,734 --> 01:12:46,319
George, how did they get you
out of Dedham, huh?

908
01:12:46,403 --> 01:12:47,570
However this happened, I...

909
01:12:47,654 --> 01:12:49,614
I'm gonna find a way to fix this,
you understand me?

910
01:12:49,698 --> 01:12:53,576
I'll never get out now. I got out once.
Not twice, never twice.

911
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:55,536
Just tell me how they got you here.

912
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:58,331
They knew! Don't you get it?

913
01:12:58,999 --> 01:13:01,792
Everything you were up to.
Your whole plan.

914
01:13:02,586 --> 01:13:06,255
This is a game. All of this is for you.

915
01:13:06,965 --> 01:13:11,427
You're not investigating anything.
You're a fucking rat in a maze.

916
01:13:12,804 --> 01:13:16,265
Georgie... George, you're wrong.
You're wrong.

917
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:20,478
Oh, really?
Been alone much since you got here?

918
01:13:22,522 --> 01:13:24,190
I've been with my partner.

919
01:13:24,858 --> 01:13:26,609
You never worked with him before,
have you?

920
01:13:28,987 --> 01:13:31,405
He's a U.S. Marshal. He's...

921
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:34,325
You never worked with him before,
have you?

922
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:40,998
George, look, I know people.
I trust this man.

923
01:13:45,963 --> 01:13:47,964
Then they've already won.

924
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:52,051
Fuck.

925
01:13:56,807 --> 01:13:59,850
And they're gonna take me
to the lighthouse.

926
01:14:01,478 --> 01:14:03,312
They're gonna cut into my brain.

927
01:14:04,773 --> 01:14:08,150
And I'm only here because of you!

928
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:11,487
George, I'm gonna get you out of here.

929
01:14:11,571 --> 01:14:13,823
You're not going to the lighthouse.
You're not.

930
01:14:13,907 --> 01:14:16,659
You can't dig out the truth
and kill Laeddis at the same time.

931
01:14:16,743 --> 01:14:20,329
You gotta make a choice.
You understand that, don't you?

932
01:14:20,747 --> 01:14:22,498
I'm not here to kill anyone.

933
01:14:22,582 --> 01:14:23,749
Liar!

934
01:14:23,834 --> 01:14:26,919
I'm not gonna kill him, I swear to you!
I swear.

935
01:14:27,170 --> 01:14:28,546
She's dead.

936
01:14:29,589 --> 01:14:31,257
She... Let her go.

937
01:14:32,759 --> 01:14:34,135
Let her go.

938
01:14:35,137 --> 01:14:37,847
Tell him, Teddy. Tell him why.

939
01:14:41,101 --> 01:14:43,769
You gotta do it. There's no other way.

940
01:14:44,396 --> 01:14:45,896
- Let her go.
- Tell him about the day

941
01:14:45,981 --> 01:14:48,858
- you brought me my locket.
- You gotta do it!

942
01:14:48,942 --> 01:14:52,361
How I told you my heart was breaking
and you asked me why.

943
01:14:52,446 --> 01:14:55,322
She's fucking with your head.

944
01:14:55,407 --> 01:14:57,283
And I told you it was from happiness.

945
01:14:57,367 --> 01:14:59,827
She's gonna kill you.
She's gonna kill you.

946
01:15:02,873 --> 01:15:06,125
You wanna uncover the truth?
You gotta let her go.

947
01:15:08,295 --> 01:15:09,962
- I can't.
- You have to let her go!

948
01:15:10,047 --> 01:15:11,922
I can't! I can't.

949
01:15:18,805 --> 01:15:21,348
Then you'll never leave this island.

950
01:15:27,105 --> 01:15:28,314
Dolores.

951
01:15:35,322 --> 01:15:36,947
He's not in this ward.

952
01:15:39,159 --> 01:15:42,161
He was transferred out of here.

953
01:15:44,331 --> 01:15:49,168
If he's not in Ward A,
there's only one place he can be.

954
01:15:55,050 --> 01:15:56,592
The lighthouse.

955
01:16:03,934 --> 01:16:05,017
Hey,

956
01:16:07,521 --> 01:16:09,021
God help you.

957
01:16:17,864 --> 01:16:21,784
Boss, we got problems. McPherson
and Cawley are in the building.

958
01:16:21,868 --> 01:16:23,619
They heard an orderly went batshit
on a patient.

959
01:16:23,703 --> 01:16:26,580
They're looking all over the place for
him and they're on their way to the roof.

960
01:16:26,665 --> 01:16:28,541
Let's get the hell out of here. This way.

961
01:16:31,545 --> 01:16:33,879
Just keep going. We belong here.

962
01:16:43,723 --> 01:16:45,516
What happened to you?

963
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:47,226
- What do you mean?
- I mean,

964
01:16:47,602 --> 01:16:49,145
where were you?

965
01:16:49,521 --> 01:16:54,275
After we got that guy to the infirmary,
I took a little detour to patient records.

966
01:16:54,359 --> 01:16:56,485
Did you ever find Laeddis?

967
01:16:56,570 --> 01:16:58,487
No. No, I never found him.

968
01:16:58,572 --> 01:17:01,490
Well, I got the next best thing.
His intake form.

969
01:17:01,575 --> 01:17:03,701
It was the only thing in his files.
There's no session notes,

970
01:17:03,785 --> 01:17:07,496
no incident reports, no photographs,
just this. It was weird.

971
01:17:07,581 --> 01:17:09,248
Here. Take a look.

972
01:17:10,083 --> 01:17:11,417
I'll look at it later.

973
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:14,712
What's the matter, boss?

974
01:17:15,589 --> 01:17:18,090
I'll look it over later, that's all.

975
01:17:20,051 --> 01:17:23,429
- Ashecliffe's that way.
- I'm not going to Ashecliffe.

976
01:17:24,931 --> 01:17:26,891
I'm going to that lighthouse.

977
01:17:26,975 --> 01:17:29,310
I'm gonna find out what the fuck
is happening on this island.

978
01:17:43,450 --> 01:17:44,867
There it is.

979
01:17:45,702 --> 01:17:49,705
Damn. We're too far south.
We're gonna have to double back.

980
01:17:49,789 --> 01:17:51,999
There's no way we could cross
those rocks.

981
01:17:52,083 --> 01:17:53,751
There could be a way
behind those trees.

982
01:17:53,835 --> 01:17:56,921
Maybe a path that goes around the
rocks and leads over to the lighthouse.

983
01:17:57,005 --> 01:17:58,047
- Boss...
- Come on.

984
01:17:58,131 --> 01:18:00,507
Wait, wait, what are we doing?
We got the intake form.

985
01:18:00,592 --> 01:18:02,384
It's proof there's a 67th patient,

986
01:18:02,469 --> 01:18:05,304
which they said, repeatedly,
doesn't exist.

987
01:18:05,764 --> 01:18:08,974
I'm getting to that lighthouse.
You understand?

988
01:18:11,311 --> 01:18:13,020
What the hell can I say to you
to stop you?

989
01:18:13,104 --> 01:18:15,397
Why would you want to, Chuck? Why?

990
01:18:15,482 --> 01:18:17,316
Because climbing down there
when it's dark

991
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:20,569
is a thin step short of suicide,
that's why.

992
01:18:20,654 --> 01:18:24,073
Okay, maybe you better sit
this one out then.

993
01:18:25,659 --> 01:18:28,953
You brought me into this, boss,
and now we're trapped here

994
01:18:29,037 --> 01:18:32,706
on this rock, on this island,
with no one to rely on but each other,

995
01:18:32,791 --> 01:18:34,750
and now you're acting like...

996
01:18:34,834 --> 01:18:37,836
Like what? Like what? How am I acting?

997
01:18:42,676 --> 01:18:46,136
What the hell happened back there
in those cells, Ted?

998
01:18:50,850 --> 01:18:54,103
What do you think the weather's like
in Portland, Chuck?

999
01:18:54,187 --> 01:18:55,854
I'm from Seattle.

1000
01:18:58,483 --> 01:18:59,733
Seattle.

1001
01:19:02,946 --> 01:19:05,698
I'm going on alone.

1002
01:19:08,618 --> 01:19:11,495
- I'm going with you, boss.
- I said alone.

1003
01:19:13,206 --> 01:19:14,331
Fine.

1004
01:19:40,984 --> 01:19:42,234
Damn it!

1005
01:19:43,236 --> 01:19:44,528
Damn it.

1006
01:19:49,743 --> 01:19:52,619
I knew it wouldn't take long,
but I couldn't get to it.

1007
01:19:52,704 --> 01:19:54,246
The tide was up.

1008
01:20:02,505 --> 01:20:07,343
Chuck!

1009
01:21:08,905 --> 01:21:10,155
Come on!

1010
01:21:45,525 --> 01:21:46,692
Chuck!

1011
01:21:47,277 --> 01:21:49,194
Where are you, Chuck?

1012
01:22:13,845 --> 01:22:17,931
Chuck!

1013
01:23:02,435 --> 01:23:03,810
Who are you?

1014
01:23:05,939 --> 01:23:08,774
I'm Teddy Daniels. I'm a cop.

1015
01:23:10,151 --> 01:23:11,860
You're the marshal.

1016
01:23:12,904 --> 01:23:14,321
That's right.

1017
01:23:16,658 --> 01:23:20,536
Would you mind taking your hand
from behind your back, please?

1018
01:23:20,620 --> 01:23:22,454
Why? Why?

1019
01:23:23,957 --> 01:23:26,959
I wanna make sure that
what you're holding won't hurt me.

1020
01:23:34,634 --> 01:23:36,343
I'm gonna keep this

1021
01:23:37,845 --> 01:23:39,346
if you don't mind.

1022
01:23:40,181 --> 01:23:41,598
Fine by me.

1023
01:23:50,650 --> 01:23:51,984
You're...

1024
01:23:53,403 --> 01:23:55,237
You're Rachel Solando.

1025
01:23:56,823 --> 01:23:58,240
The real one.

1026
01:24:02,245 --> 01:24:03,870
Did you kill your children?

1027
01:24:05,665 --> 01:24:07,499
I never had children.

1028
01:24:08,167 --> 01:24:09,960
I was never married.

1029
01:24:11,504 --> 01:24:15,048
And before I was a patient at Ashecliffe,
I worked here.

1030
01:24:15,675 --> 01:24:18,260
You... You were a nurse?

1031
01:24:20,597 --> 01:24:22,556
I was a doctor, Marshal.

1032
01:24:25,977 --> 01:24:27,686
You think I'm crazy.

1033
01:24:28,062 --> 01:24:31,398
- No. No, no, I never...
- And if I say I'm not crazy?

1034
01:24:32,609 --> 01:24:35,027
Well, that hardly helps, does it?

1035
01:24:35,862 --> 01:24:38,363
That's the Kafkaesque genius of it.

1036
01:24:41,659 --> 01:24:43,952
People tell the world you're crazy,

1037
01:24:44,037 --> 01:24:47,956
and all your protests to the contrary
just confirm what they're saying.

1038
01:24:48,541 --> 01:24:51,710
I'm not following you. I'm sorry.

1039
01:24:52,337 --> 01:24:54,296
Once you're declared insane,

1040
01:24:54,380 --> 01:24:57,883
then anything you do
is called part of that insanity.

1041
01:24:57,967 --> 01:25:03,555
Reasonable protests are denial.
Valid fears, paranoia.

1042
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:07,726
Survival instincts
are defense mechanisms.

1043
01:25:08,019 --> 01:25:11,730
You're smarter than you look, Marshal.
That's probably not a good thing.

1044
01:25:12,607 --> 01:25:14,066
Tell me something.

1045
01:25:14,150 --> 01:25:15,275
Yeah.

1046
01:25:16,444 --> 01:25:18,236
What happened to you?

1047
01:25:19,072 --> 01:25:22,491
I started asking about these
large shipments of sodium amytal

1048
01:25:22,575 --> 01:25:24,326
and opium-based hallucinogens.

1049
01:25:24,410 --> 01:25:26,119
Psychotropic drugs.

1050
01:25:27,497 --> 01:25:29,873
I asked about the surgeries, too.

1051
01:25:31,918 --> 01:25:34,086
You ever heard of
a transorbital lobotomy?

1052
01:25:35,630 --> 01:25:38,340
They zap the patient with electroshock,

1053
01:25:38,424 --> 01:25:41,259
then go through the eye with an ice pick,

1054
01:25:43,429 --> 01:25:45,514
pull out some nerve fibers.

1055
01:25:47,934 --> 01:25:50,394
Makes the patients much more obedient.

1056
01:25:50,478 --> 01:25:51,812
Tractable.

1057
01:25:53,272 --> 01:25:54,773
It's barbaric,

1058
01:25:55,775 --> 01:25:57,275
unconscionable.

1059
01:25:58,277 --> 01:26:02,030
Do you know how pain
enters the body, Marshal? Do you?

1060
01:26:03,282 --> 01:26:04,741
Depends on where you're hurt?

1061
01:26:04,826 --> 01:26:09,996
No, it has nothing to do with the flesh.
The brain controls pain.

1062
01:26:10,623 --> 01:26:15,001
The brain controls fear, empathy, sleep,
hunger, anger. Everything.

1063
01:26:17,338 --> 01:26:19,131
What if you could control it?

1064
01:26:19,632 --> 01:26:21,091
You mean the brain?

1065
01:26:21,175 --> 01:26:27,973
Recreate a man so he doesn't feel
pain or love or sympathy.

1066
01:26:29,434 --> 01:26:30,892
A man who can't be interrogated,

1067
01:26:30,977 --> 01:26:33,687
because he has no memories
to confess.

1068
01:26:36,274 --> 01:26:39,943
You can never take away
all a man's memories. Never.

1069
01:26:40,027 --> 01:26:44,156
Marshal, the North Koreans
used American POWs

1070
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:45,907
during their brainwashing experiments.

1071
01:26:45,992 --> 01:26:49,411
They turned soldiers into traitors.
That's what they're doing here.

1072
01:26:49,495 --> 01:26:51,580
They're creating ghosts
to go out in the world

1073
01:26:51,664 --> 01:26:54,916
and do things sane men...
Sane men never would.

1074
01:26:55,001 --> 01:26:58,336
To have that kind of ability,
that kind of knowledge,

1075
01:26:58,421 --> 01:27:00,672
- that would take years.
- Years. Years of research.

1076
01:27:01,174 --> 01:27:03,884
Hundreds of patients to experiment on.

1077
01:27:05,136 --> 01:27:07,554
Fifty years from now,
people will look back

1078
01:27:07,638 --> 01:27:11,016
and say, here, this place,
is where it all began.

1079
01:27:11,726 --> 01:27:16,521
The Nazis used the Jews, Soviets used
prisoners in their own Gulags,

1080
01:27:17,356 --> 01:27:20,817
and we tested patients
on Shutter Island.

1081
01:27:22,487 --> 01:27:24,154
No, they won't.

1082
01:27:25,114 --> 01:27:26,114
No.

1083
01:27:28,576 --> 01:27:30,702
You do understand

1084
01:27:33,247 --> 01:27:35,540
that they can't let you leave.

1085
01:27:35,833 --> 01:27:39,169
I am a federal marshal.
They can't stop me.

1086
01:27:40,546 --> 01:27:45,634
I was an esteemed psychiatrist
from a respected family.

1087
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:49,346
Didn't matter.

1088
01:27:52,058 --> 01:27:53,642
Let me ask you.

1089
01:27:53,726 --> 01:27:56,102
Any past traumas in your life?

1090
01:27:57,480 --> 01:27:58,730
Yes.

1091
01:27:59,899 --> 01:28:01,983
But why would that matter?

1092
01:28:02,068 --> 01:28:04,361
Because they're gonna point
to some event in your past

1093
01:28:04,445 --> 01:28:06,947
and say it's the reason
you lost your sanity.

1094
01:28:07,031 --> 01:28:12,410
So that when they commit you here,
your friends and colleagues will say,

1095
01:28:12,495 --> 01:28:14,412
"Of course he cracked.

1096
01:28:15,414 --> 01:28:16,665
"Who wouldn't after what
he'd been through?"

1097
01:28:16,749 --> 01:28:19,251
They can say that about anyone,
anyone at all.

1098
01:28:19,335 --> 01:28:22,295
The point is
they're gonna say it about you.

1099
01:28:25,550 --> 01:28:27,175
How's your head?

1100
01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:29,344
My head?

1101
01:28:29,428 --> 01:28:32,848
Any funny dreams lately?
Trouble sleeping?

1102
01:28:35,059 --> 01:28:39,396
- Headaches?
- I am prone to migraines, yes.

1103
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:40,772
Jesus.

1104
01:28:43,067 --> 01:28:46,570
You haven't taken any pills, have you?
I mean, even aspirin?

1105
01:28:46,654 --> 01:28:48,822
- The aspirin?
- Jesus.

1106
01:28:49,490 --> 01:28:53,201
And you ate the food in the cafeteria
and drank the coffee they gave you?

1107
01:28:53,286 --> 01:28:56,663
You tell me, at least, that you've
been smoking your own cigarettes.

1108
01:28:58,457 --> 01:29:01,751
No.

1109
01:29:02,837 --> 01:29:04,212
No, I haven't.

1110
01:29:04,297 --> 01:29:07,048
It takes 36 to 48 hours
for neuroleptic narcotics

1111
01:29:07,133 --> 01:29:09,718
to reach workable levels
in the bloodstream.

1112
01:29:11,512 --> 01:29:13,346
Palsy comes first,

1113
01:29:14,265 --> 01:29:17,726
first the fingertips,
then eventually the whole hand.

1114
01:29:18,644 --> 01:29:22,814
Seen any walking nightmares
lately, Marshal?

1115
01:29:25,318 --> 01:29:28,278
Tell me what goes on in that lighthouse.

1116
01:29:29,155 --> 01:29:30,488
Tell me.

1117
01:29:31,657 --> 01:29:33,283
Brain surgery.

1118
01:29:33,951 --> 01:29:38,413
The let's-open-the-skull-and-see-
what-happens-if-we-pull-on-this kind.

1119
01:29:38,956 --> 01:29:41,833
The learned-it-from-the-Nazis kind.

1120
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:46,379
That's where they create the ghosts.

1121
01:29:47,798 --> 01:29:51,676
Who knows about this?
On the island, I mean. Who?

1122
01:29:54,013 --> 01:29:55,263
Everyone.

1123
01:29:55,348 --> 01:29:59,059
Come on. The nurses? The orderlies?

1124
01:29:59,644 --> 01:30:02,938
- They couldn't possibly know...
- Everyone.

1125
01:30:21,874 --> 01:30:23,416
You can't stay here.

1126
01:30:24,043 --> 01:30:25,335
They think I'm dead, that I drowned.

1127
01:30:25,419 --> 01:30:28,421
I'm afraid if they come looking for you,
they might find me.

1128
01:30:28,506 --> 01:30:30,882
I'm sorry, but you have to go.

1129
01:30:37,515 --> 01:30:39,140
I'm gonna come back for you.

1130
01:30:39,225 --> 01:30:42,185
I won't be here. I move during the day.
New places every night.

1131
01:30:42,269 --> 01:30:44,604
But I could come get you,
get you off this island.

1132
01:30:44,689 --> 01:30:47,399
Haven't you heard a word I've said?

1133
01:30:47,483 --> 01:30:51,611
The only way off the island is the ferry,
and they control it.

1134
01:30:51,696 --> 01:30:53,738
You'll never leave here.

1135
01:31:03,082 --> 01:31:04,874
I had a friend.

1136
01:31:04,959 --> 01:31:08,503
I was with him yesterday,
but we got separated.

1137
01:31:08,587 --> 01:31:10,255
Have you seen him?

1138
01:31:11,424 --> 01:31:12,757
Marshal,

1139
01:31:14,301 --> 01:31:16,428
you have no friends.

1140
01:31:48,753 --> 01:31:50,295
There you are.

1141
01:31:53,132 --> 01:31:55,800
We were wondering
when you'd show up.

1142
01:31:57,428 --> 01:31:58,970
Have a seat.

1143
01:31:59,430 --> 01:32:00,722
Come on.

1144
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:14,027
Taking a leisurely stroll, were we?

1145
01:32:15,112 --> 01:32:18,156
I was just looking around.

1146
01:32:21,118 --> 01:32:23,536
Did you enjoy God's latest gift?

1147
01:32:25,164 --> 01:32:26,498
- What?
- God's gift.

1148
01:32:28,667 --> 01:32:30,001
The violence.

1149
01:32:32,838 --> 01:32:37,217
When I came downstairs in my home
and I saw that tree in my living room,

1150
01:32:37,301 --> 01:32:41,137
it reached out for me like a divine hand.

1151
01:32:43,349 --> 01:32:45,183
God loves violence.

1152
01:32:47,853 --> 01:32:50,688
- I hadn't noticed.
- Sure you have.

1153
01:32:51,857 --> 01:32:56,986
Why else would there be so much of it?
It's in us. It's what we are.

1154
01:32:59,031 --> 01:33:01,366
We wage war, we burn sacrifices,

1155
01:33:01,450 --> 01:33:03,993
and pillage and plunder
and tear at the flesh of our brothers.

1156
01:33:04,078 --> 01:33:07,997
And why? Because God gave us
violence to wage in his honor.

1157
01:33:11,210 --> 01:33:13,628
I thought God gave us moral order.

1158
01:33:13,712 --> 01:33:16,714
There's no moral order
as pure as this storm.

1159
01:33:17,341 --> 01:33:19,634
There's no moral order at all.

1160
01:33:19,927 --> 01:33:23,471
There's just this,
can my violence conquer yours?

1161
01:33:29,061 --> 01:33:31,479
- I'm not violent.
- Yes, you are.

1162
01:33:32,606 --> 01:33:35,024
You're as violent as they come.

1163
01:33:35,734 --> 01:33:39,320
I know this
because I'm as violent as they come.

1164
01:33:39,405 --> 01:33:41,573
If the constraints of society were lifted,

1165
01:33:41,657 --> 01:33:44,325
and I was all that stood
between you and a meal,

1166
01:33:44,410 --> 01:33:48,204
you would crack my skull with a rock
and eat my meaty parts.

1167
01:33:49,748 --> 01:33:51,332
Wouldn't you?

1168
01:33:54,086 --> 01:33:56,546
Cawley thinks you're harmless,
that you can be controlled,

1169
01:33:56,630 --> 01:33:58,506
but I know different.

1170
01:33:59,133 --> 01:34:00,884
- You don't know me.
- Oh, but I do.

1171
01:34:00,968 --> 01:34:04,137
- No, you don't. You don't know me at all.
- Oh, I know you.

1172
01:34:04,221 --> 01:34:06,931
We've known each other for centuries.

1173
01:34:16,275 --> 01:34:19,194
If I was to sink my teeth
into your eye right now,

1174
01:34:19,278 --> 01:34:22,614
would you be able to stop me
before I blinded you?

1175
01:34:26,744 --> 01:34:28,369
Give it a try.

1176
01:34:29,914 --> 01:34:31,623
That's the spirit.

1177
01:35:06,367 --> 01:35:08,993
Don't worry, because we're going
to get you back to your room.

1178
01:35:10,621 --> 01:35:12,288
- Not really.
- Something I've seen.

1179
01:35:12,373 --> 01:35:13,623
Okay.

1180
01:35:18,837 --> 01:35:20,588
Where have you been?

1181
01:35:20,673 --> 01:35:23,424
Oh, just wandering.
Just looking at your island.

1182
01:35:23,509 --> 01:35:27,178
Oh, I forgot you're leaving
now that Rachel's been found.

1183
01:35:28,013 --> 01:35:29,430
- Stop looking at him.
- For sure. Yeah.

1184
01:35:29,515 --> 01:35:32,767
Stop looking at him. Stop looking at him.

1185
01:35:32,851 --> 01:35:34,852
- Big meeting?
- Oh, yes.

1186
01:35:34,937 --> 01:35:36,604
- It's okay. I'm...
- I don't like that.

1187
01:35:36,689 --> 01:35:38,690
Apparently there was
an unidentified man

1188
01:35:38,774 --> 01:35:40,066
in Ward C yesterday.

1189
01:35:40,150 --> 01:35:43,528
He subdued a highly dangerous patient
quite handily.

1190
01:35:44,113 --> 01:35:45,113
Is that so?

1191
01:35:45,197 --> 01:35:47,657
It seems he had a long conversation
with a paranoid schizophrenic,

1192
01:35:47,741 --> 01:35:48,950
George Noyce.

1193
01:35:49,034 --> 01:35:51,828
Well, I don't remember
what I'm supposed to remember.

1194
01:35:51,912 --> 01:35:53,621
We're gated down. We're fine.

1195
01:35:53,706 --> 01:35:57,750
This Noyce, you said
his name was, he's delusional?

1196
01:35:57,835 --> 01:36:00,545
Extremely. He can be quite upsetting.

1197
01:36:00,629 --> 01:36:02,338
As a matter of fact, two weeks ago,

1198
01:36:02,423 --> 01:36:06,884
a patient got so wound up by one
of Noyce's stories that he beat him up.

1199
01:36:08,137 --> 01:36:09,554
Cigarette?

1200
01:36:11,348 --> 01:36:13,141
No, thanks. I quit.

1201
01:36:14,226 --> 01:36:18,271
- So you're taking the ferry?
- Yes, absolutely.

1202
01:36:18,355 --> 01:36:21,816
I think we've gotten
all we came here for, so...

1203
01:36:21,900 --> 01:36:23,234
"We," Marshal?

1204
01:36:25,237 --> 01:36:28,823
Speaking of which,
have you seen him, Doctor?

1205
01:36:28,907 --> 01:36:30,074
Who?

1206
01:36:30,909 --> 01:36:32,618
My partner, Chuck.

1207
01:36:34,955 --> 01:36:37,790
You don't have a partner, Marshal.
You came here alone.

1208
01:36:40,252 --> 01:36:42,420
You know, I've built
something valuable here,

1209
01:36:42,504 --> 01:36:45,673
and valuable things have a way of
being misunderstood in their own time.

1210
01:36:45,758 --> 01:36:47,842
Everyone wants a quick fix.
They always have.

1211
01:36:47,926 --> 01:36:51,512
I'm trying to do something that people,
yourself included, don't understand.

1212
01:36:51,597 --> 01:36:54,557
And I'm not going to give up
without a fight.

1213
01:36:56,393 --> 01:36:58,019
I can see that.

1214
01:37:02,107 --> 01:37:04,734
So, tell me again about your partner.

1215
01:37:06,445 --> 01:37:08,071
What partner?

1216
01:37:10,824 --> 01:37:11,908
It's fine.

1217
01:38:00,249 --> 01:38:04,043
She made a mess. I cleaned it up.
She made a mess again.

1218
01:38:13,345 --> 01:38:14,720
Marshal,

1219
01:38:16,098 --> 01:38:17,723
going somewhere?

1220
01:38:18,016 --> 01:38:21,185
I'm just heading out to the ferry, so...

1221
01:38:21,687 --> 01:38:25,231
Oh, well, I'm afraid it's the other way.

1222
01:38:28,193 --> 01:38:32,864
If you'll wait a moment, I'll find you
someone who can take you to the dock.

1223
01:38:37,536 --> 01:38:41,372
- What's this, Doctor? What's this?
- It's just a sedative.

1224
01:38:41,457 --> 01:38:44,625
- A precaution.
- A precaution.

1225
01:38:47,546 --> 01:38:51,632
What are you going to do?
Kill me? Marshal.

1226
01:38:52,009 --> 01:38:53,551
You think you deserve it?

1227
01:38:53,635 --> 01:38:56,429
For what? Provoking you?

1228
01:38:57,222 --> 01:39:00,057
Well, forgive me.
What doesn't provoke you?

1229
01:39:00,601 --> 01:39:03,728
- Remarks? Words?
- Nazis?

1230
01:39:04,188 --> 01:39:08,232
Well, that, too.
And, of course, memories, dreams.

1231
01:39:09,318 --> 01:39:13,571
Did you know that the word "trauma"
comes from the Greek for "wound"?

1232
01:39:14,239 --> 01:39:16,991
And what is the German word
for "dream"?

1233
01:39:20,621 --> 01:39:23,581
Wounds can create monsters,
and you...

1234
01:39:24,249 --> 01:39:26,626
You are wounded, Marshal.

1235
01:39:27,669 --> 01:39:30,838
And wouldn't you agree,
when you see a monster,

1236
01:39:31,548 --> 01:39:33,299
you must stop it?

1237
01:39:33,884 --> 01:39:35,092
Yeah.

1238
01:39:36,261 --> 01:39:38,095
- I agree.
- Yes.

1239
01:39:38,931 --> 01:39:40,014
Yeah.

1240
01:39:57,241 --> 01:39:59,492
I told him that we'd take
about an hour to do it.

1241
01:39:59,576 --> 01:40:02,662
Yeah. Did they say
we're going to do the first floor?

1242
01:40:02,746 --> 01:40:03,996
How long you been on the clock?

1243
01:40:04,081 --> 01:40:07,792
- I've been on for 18 hours straight.
- Nice paycheck.

1244
01:40:24,935 --> 01:40:27,019
What are you doing, baby?

1245
01:40:31,817 --> 01:40:34,318
- You gotta get to the ferry.
- No.

1246
01:40:35,070 --> 01:40:36,362
No, no.

1247
01:40:37,573 --> 01:40:38,739
Yeah.

1248
01:40:39,866 --> 01:40:44,745
If the world thinks that Chuck is dead,
then he's perfect for their experiments.

1249
01:40:45,831 --> 01:40:48,082
There's only one place they'd take him.

1250
01:40:50,711 --> 01:40:52,336
You go there and you'll die.

1251
01:40:52,421 --> 01:40:54,088
He's my partner. If they are hurting him,

1252
01:40:54,172 --> 01:40:57,341
if they're holding him against his will,
I've gotta bring him out.

1253
01:40:57,426 --> 01:40:59,468
I can't lose anyone else.

1254
01:40:59,553 --> 01:41:00,803
Don't go, Teddy, please.

1255
01:41:00,887 --> 01:41:04,307
- Please, don't do this. Don't go.
- I'm sorry, honey.

1256
01:41:07,894 --> 01:41:09,687
I'm sorry, honey.

1257
01:41:10,772 --> 01:41:13,816
I love this thing
because you gave it to me,

1258
01:41:16,194 --> 01:41:18,029
but the truth is

1259
01:41:19,698 --> 01:41:21,866
it is one fucking ugly tie.

1260
01:42:02,074 --> 01:42:03,240
No.

1261
01:43:25,157 --> 01:43:26,532
Don't move. Stay where you are.

1262
01:43:28,535 --> 01:43:29,952
Are you gonna kill me?

1263
01:43:31,621 --> 01:43:34,165
No, I'm not gonna kill you.

1264
01:45:26,778 --> 01:45:28,654
Why are you all wet, baby?

1265
01:45:30,866 --> 01:45:34,118
- What did you say?
- You know exactly what I said.

1266
01:45:47,215 --> 01:45:49,466
The rifle's empty, by the way.

1267
01:45:55,974 --> 01:45:57,474
Have a seat.

1268
01:46:03,982 --> 01:46:06,400
For God's sake, dry off.
You'll catch cold.

1269
01:46:08,028 --> 01:46:09,153
All right.

1270
01:46:12,699 --> 01:46:14,617
How badly did you hurt the guard?

1271
01:46:16,328 --> 01:46:19,330
I don't know what you're talking about.

1272
01:46:22,500 --> 01:46:24,418
Yes, he's here.

1273
01:46:24,502 --> 01:46:28,505
Have Dr. Sheehan take a look at
your man before you send him up.

1274
01:46:28,590 --> 01:46:33,302
So Dr. Sheehan came in
on the ferry this morning, huh?

1275
01:46:34,262 --> 01:46:35,763
Not exactly.

1276
01:46:36,806 --> 01:46:39,850
You blew up my car.
I really loved that car.

1277
01:46:40,769 --> 01:46:42,853
Sorry to hear about that.

1278
01:46:46,149 --> 01:46:48,525
Tremors are getting pretty bad.

1279
01:46:49,152 --> 01:46:51,570
How are the hallucinations?

1280
01:46:51,655 --> 01:46:53,948
Get out of here, Teddy.

1281
01:46:54,032 --> 01:46:55,824
This place is gonna be the end of you.

1282
01:46:59,579 --> 01:47:00,704
Not bad.

1283
01:47:00,789 --> 01:47:03,374
- They'll get worse.
- I know.

1284
01:47:04,250 --> 01:47:08,545
Dr. Solando,
she told me about the neuroleptics.

1285
01:47:09,089 --> 01:47:11,548
Did she, now? And when was this?

1286
01:47:11,633 --> 01:47:16,428
I found her, Doctor,
in a cave out by the cliffs.

1287
01:47:16,513 --> 01:47:17,888
But you'll never get to her.

1288
01:47:17,973 --> 01:47:21,392
I don't doubt it,
considering she's not real.

1289
01:47:23,603 --> 01:47:26,730
Your delusions are more severe
than I thought.

1290
01:47:27,941 --> 01:47:30,109
You're not on neuroleptics.

1291
01:47:30,568 --> 01:47:32,444
You're not on anything,
as a matter of fact.

1292
01:47:32,529 --> 01:47:35,155
Then what the fuck is this?
What the fuck is this?

1293
01:47:35,240 --> 01:47:36,240
Withdrawal.

1294
01:47:37,242 --> 01:47:39,201
Withdrawal? From what?

1295
01:47:39,285 --> 01:47:41,620
I haven't had a goddamn drink
since I've been on this island.

1296
01:47:41,705 --> 01:47:43,330
Chlorpromazine.

1297
01:47:44,165 --> 01:47:47,835
I'm not a fan of pharmacology,
but I have to say, in your case...

1298
01:47:47,919 --> 01:47:51,171
- Chloraproma-what?
- Chlorpromazine.

1299
01:47:51,256 --> 01:47:55,259
The same thing we've been giving you
for the past 24 months.

1300
01:47:56,553 --> 01:47:58,679
So for the past two years, you...

1301
01:47:58,763 --> 01:48:02,057
You've had somebody slipping me drugs
in Boston. Is that it?

1302
01:48:02,142 --> 01:48:03,600
Not Boston.

1303
01:48:04,102 --> 01:48:05,269
Here.

1304
01:48:06,062 --> 01:48:10,024
You've been here for two years.
A patient of this institution.

1305
01:48:13,778 --> 01:48:17,531
After everything I've seen here, Doctor,

1306
01:48:17,615 --> 01:48:21,035
you really think you're gonna
convince me I'm crazy?

1307
01:48:21,119 --> 01:48:23,078
Do you know the kind of people
that I deal with every day?

1308
01:48:23,163 --> 01:48:25,039
I'm a U.S. Marshal, for God's sakes.

1309
01:48:25,123 --> 01:48:26,999
You were a U.S. Marshal.

1310
01:48:27,083 --> 01:48:30,878
Here's a copy of the intake form
you broke into Ward C for.

1311
01:48:30,962 --> 01:48:32,337
Proof of the 67th patient.

1312
01:48:32,422 --> 01:48:33,589
If you'd gotten it to the mainland,

1313
01:48:33,673 --> 01:48:35,466
you could have
blown the lid off this place.

1314
01:48:35,550 --> 01:48:36,675
Wait. Where did... Where did you...

1315
01:48:36,760 --> 01:48:38,552
Yet somehow,
you couldn't find time to look at it.

1316
01:48:38,636 --> 01:48:40,345
Well, read it now.

1317
01:48:40,805 --> 01:48:42,181
Go ahead.

1318
01:48:45,977 --> 01:48:49,813
"Patient is highly intelligent, highly
delusional decorated Army veteran.

1319
01:48:49,898 --> 01:48:53,650
"Present for the liberation of Dachau.

1320
01:48:53,735 --> 01:48:56,361
"Former U.S. Marshal.
Known proclivity for violence.

1321
01:48:56,446 --> 01:48:59,698
"Shows no remorse for his crime
because he denies the crime ever...

1322
01:48:59,783 --> 01:49:00,824
"Ever took place.

1323
01:49:00,909 --> 01:49:02,785
"Highly developed
and fantastical narratives,

1324
01:49:02,869 --> 01:49:05,245
"which preclude facing
the truth of his actions."

1325
01:49:05,330 --> 01:49:06,413
I've had enough of this bullshit!

1326
01:49:06,498 --> 01:49:10,375
Where's my partner? Where's Chuck?
Where is he?

1327
01:49:10,460 --> 01:49:12,169
Let's try this another way.

1328
01:49:12,253 --> 01:49:14,797
Your wife's maiden name was Chanal,
am I correct?

1329
01:49:14,881 --> 01:49:16,298
Don't you even talk about her.
Don't you...

1330
01:49:16,382 --> 01:49:18,258
I'm afraid I have to.

1331
01:49:20,345 --> 01:49:24,556
Notice anything these four names
have in common? It's your rule of four.

1332
01:49:24,641 --> 01:49:25,766
Andrew, what do you see?

1333
01:49:25,850 --> 01:49:28,852
If you've done anything to my partner,
Doctor, that is a violation of...

1334
01:49:28,937 --> 01:49:31,355
Focus, Andrew! What do you see?

1335
01:49:32,357 --> 01:49:34,858
The names have the same letters.

1336
01:49:35,735 --> 01:49:39,154
Edward Daniels has exactly
the same 13 letters as Andrew Laeddis.

1337
01:49:39,239 --> 01:49:41,448
The same as Rachel Solando
and Dolores Chanal.

1338
01:49:41,533 --> 01:49:43,617
The names are anagrams
for each other.

1339
01:49:43,701 --> 01:49:46,286
Your tactics,
they're not gonna work on me.

1340
01:49:46,371 --> 01:49:49,164
You came here for the truth. Here it is.

1341
01:49:49,249 --> 01:49:51,250
Your name is Andrew Laeddis.

1342
01:49:51,334 --> 01:49:54,878
The 67th patient at Ashecliffe
is you, Andrew.

1343
01:49:56,714 --> 01:49:57,673
Bullshit.

1344
01:49:57,757 --> 01:49:59,967
You were committed here by court order
24 months ago.

1345
01:50:00,051 --> 01:50:03,387
Your crime is terrible,
one you can't forgive yourself for,

1346
01:50:03,471 --> 01:50:05,848
so you invented another self.

1347
01:50:08,017 --> 01:50:09,434
All right.

1348
01:50:09,936 --> 01:50:12,604
Let's get down to the facts, all right?

1349
01:50:12,689 --> 01:50:15,566
You've created a story
in which you're not a murderer.

1350
01:50:15,650 --> 01:50:17,693
You're a hero, still a U.S. Marshal,

1351
01:50:17,777 --> 01:50:19,695
only here at Ashecliffe
because of a case,

1352
01:50:19,779 --> 01:50:23,115
and you've uncovered a conspiracy
so that anything we tell you

1353
01:50:23,199 --> 01:50:27,035
about who you are, what you've done,
you can dismiss as lies, Andrew.

1354
01:50:27,120 --> 01:50:28,412
My name is Edward Daniels.

1355
01:50:28,496 --> 01:50:32,749
I've been hearing this fantasy for
two years now. I know every detail.

1356
01:50:32,834 --> 01:50:34,793
Patient 67, the storm,

1357
01:50:34,878 --> 01:50:38,088
Rachel Solando, your missing partner,
the dreams you have every night.

1358
01:50:38,173 --> 01:50:40,591
You were at Dachau,
but you may not have killed any guards.

1359
01:50:44,637 --> 01:50:48,307
I wish I could let you just live
in your fantasy world.

1360
01:50:48,391 --> 01:50:49,850
I really do.

1361
01:50:50,727 --> 01:50:52,936
But you're violent, trained, dangerous.

1362
01:50:53,021 --> 01:50:55,314
You're the most dangerous patient
we have.

1363
01:50:55,398 --> 01:50:57,691
You've injured orderlies, guards,
other patients.

1364
01:50:57,775 --> 01:50:59,693
Two weeks ago,
you attacked George Noyce.

1365
01:50:59,777 --> 01:51:02,029
No, no. I am fucking on to you, Doctor.

1366
01:51:02,113 --> 01:51:03,989
- You had Noyce beaten.
- Of course I didn't!

1367
01:51:04,073 --> 01:51:06,158
Give me one reason
why I would even touch him!

1368
01:51:06,242 --> 01:51:08,619
Because he called you Laeddis,

1369
01:51:08,703 --> 01:51:11,747
and you'd do anything not to be him.

1370
01:51:11,831 --> 01:51:15,417
I have a transcript of the conversation
you had with Noyce yesterday.

1371
01:51:15,501 --> 01:51:19,546
"This is about you, and, Laeddis,
that's all it's ever been about."

1372
01:51:21,466 --> 01:51:23,967
No, no. He's saying
this is about me and Laeddis.

1373
01:51:24,052 --> 01:51:25,928
When you asked him
what happened to his face,

1374
01:51:26,012 --> 01:51:29,389
he said, now here I'm quoting again,
"You did this."

1375
01:51:29,474 --> 01:51:31,600
No, no, he meant that it was my fault.

1376
01:51:31,684 --> 01:51:33,685
You almost killed him.

1377
01:51:35,355 --> 01:51:38,148
The warden and the Board of Overseers
are determined something be done.

1378
01:51:38,233 --> 01:51:39,942
It's been decided

1379
01:51:40,026 --> 01:51:44,655
that unless we can bring you
back to sanity now, right now,

1380
01:51:44,739 --> 01:51:48,158
permanent measures will be taken to
ensure you can't hurt anyone ever again.

1381
01:51:51,663 --> 01:51:54,998
They'll lobotomize you, Andrew.
Do you understand?

1382
01:51:59,254 --> 01:52:01,171
Yeah, I understand.

1383
01:52:02,006 --> 01:52:04,216
I understand just fine.

1384
01:52:04,842 --> 01:52:08,929
If I don't play along
with your little game here,

1385
01:52:09,013 --> 01:52:12,140
Dr. Naehring's gonna turn me
into one of his ghosts.

1386
01:52:12,600 --> 01:52:13,976
But what about my partner?

1387
01:52:14,060 --> 01:52:18,522
You gonna tell the U.S. Marshal's office
that he's a defense mechanism?

1388
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:21,858
Hello, boss.

1389
01:52:38,710 --> 01:52:41,503
What the fuck is going on here?

1390
01:52:44,382 --> 01:52:48,010
You working for him?

1391
01:52:48,845 --> 01:52:50,345
I'm sorry. There wasn't any other way.

1392
01:52:50,430 --> 01:52:53,348
Someone had to stick with you,
keep you safe.

1393
01:52:56,227 --> 01:52:58,353
You been watching me, huh?

1394
01:52:59,314 --> 01:53:01,398
Watching me every minute.

1395
01:53:02,317 --> 01:53:05,319
Who are you? Who are you? Tell me.

1396
01:53:06,112 --> 01:53:08,113
Don't you recognize me, Andrew?

1397
01:53:09,532 --> 01:53:13,243
I've been your primary psychiatrist
for the last two years.

1398
01:53:13,828 --> 01:53:15,704
I'm Lester Sheehan.

1399
01:53:22,170 --> 01:53:24,838
- I told you... I told you about my wife, I...
- I know.

1400
01:53:24,922 --> 01:53:28,175
I climbed down a cliff to get you.
I trusted you.

1401
01:53:28,259 --> 01:53:31,887
I risked everything to come
in here after you. Everything!

1402
01:53:31,971 --> 01:53:33,013
I know, boss.

1403
01:53:33,097 --> 01:53:35,891
We're running out of time here, Andrew.

1404
01:53:36,267 --> 01:53:37,851
I swore before the Board of Overseers

1405
01:53:37,935 --> 01:53:41,855
that I could construct the most radical,
cutting-edge role-play

1406
01:53:41,939 --> 01:53:44,191
ever attempted in psychiatry,
and it would bring you back.

1407
01:53:44,275 --> 01:53:47,319
I thought that if we let you play this out

1408
01:53:47,403 --> 01:53:51,031
we could get you to see
how untrue, how impossible it is.

1409
01:53:52,116 --> 01:53:54,576
You've had the run of the place
for two days.

1410
01:53:54,660 --> 01:53:57,954
Tell me, where are
the Nazi experiments?

1411
01:53:58,039 --> 01:53:59,831
The satanic ORs?

1412
01:54:13,471 --> 01:54:15,347
Andrew, listen to me.

1413
01:54:17,725 --> 01:54:19,976
If we fail with you,

1414
01:54:20,061 --> 01:54:23,980
then everything that we've tried to do
here will be discredited. Everything.

1415
01:54:26,109 --> 01:54:29,277
We're on the front lines
of a war here, old boy.

1416
01:54:30,029 --> 01:54:32,906
And right now, it all comes down to you.

1417
01:54:39,831 --> 01:54:42,541
- Don't move! Don't move!
- Andrew! Andrew! No. No.

1418
01:54:42,625 --> 01:54:45,836
My name is Edward Daniels!

1419
01:54:45,920 --> 01:54:47,963
This one's loaded.
I can tell by the weight.

1420
01:54:48,047 --> 01:54:50,632
I see. And that's your firearm, Marshal?
You're sure?

1421
01:54:50,716 --> 01:54:51,925
My initials are on the side.

1422
01:54:52,009 --> 01:54:54,302
There's a dent in the barrel
from when Philip Stacks shot at me.

1423
01:54:54,387 --> 01:54:56,513
You're not gonna fuck with my mind
on this one, Doctor!

1424
01:54:56,597 --> 01:54:57,639
Then blast away.

1425
01:54:57,723 --> 01:55:01,059
Because that's the only way
you're ever getting off this island.

1426
01:55:07,150 --> 01:55:09,025
Andrew, please don't.

1427
01:55:19,912 --> 01:55:21,204
My gun.

1428
01:55:27,795 --> 01:55:30,380
What did you do to my goddamn gun?

1429
01:55:30,798 --> 01:55:31,965
It's a toy, Andrew.

1430
01:55:35,470 --> 01:55:37,554
We're telling you the truth.

1431
01:55:38,055 --> 01:55:41,308
Dolores was insane,
manic-depressive, suicidal.

1432
01:55:41,976 --> 01:55:45,061
You drank, stayed away,
ignored what everyone told you.

1433
01:55:45,146 --> 01:55:46,271
You moved to that lake house

1434
01:55:46,355 --> 01:55:49,483
after she purposely set
your city apartment on fire.

1435
01:55:49,567 --> 01:55:50,859
- You were...
- You're lying.

1436
01:55:50,943 --> 01:55:54,404
- Andrew! Andrew, stop. No.
- You drugged the cigarettes!

1437
01:55:54,489 --> 01:55:56,323
- All you've done is lie!
- Andrew. Andrew.

1438
01:55:56,407 --> 01:55:59,618
Your children. Andrew, your children.

1439
01:55:59,702 --> 01:56:02,370
Simon. Henry.

1440
01:56:02,747 --> 01:56:04,039
I never had any children.

1441
01:56:04,123 --> 01:56:08,168
Your wife drowned them
at the cabin by the lake.

1442
01:56:08,252 --> 01:56:11,463
And here, the little girl,
the one you dream of

1443
01:56:12,173 --> 01:56:13,840
every night.

1444
01:56:13,925 --> 01:56:15,091
I never had a little girl.

1445
01:56:15,176 --> 01:56:18,762
The one who tells you over and over
that you should have saved her,

1446
01:56:18,846 --> 01:56:20,764
saved them all.

1447
01:56:20,848 --> 01:56:23,308
Your daughter, her name was Rachel.

1448
01:56:23,392 --> 01:56:26,269
Are you going to deny
that she ever lived?

1449
01:56:27,021 --> 01:56:28,772
Andrew, are you?

1450
01:56:51,754 --> 01:56:53,838
I'm so sorry, baby.

1451
01:56:58,219 --> 01:57:00,595
I told you not to come in here.

1452
01:57:01,055 --> 01:57:05,016
I told you this would be the end of you.

1453
01:57:25,371 --> 01:57:26,705
I'm back!

1454
01:57:27,331 --> 01:57:30,083
We got him just outside of Oklahoma.

1455
01:57:30,167 --> 01:57:32,711
Must've stopped 10 places
in between here and Tulsa.

1456
01:57:32,795 --> 01:57:34,879
I could sleep for a week.

1457
01:57:38,843 --> 01:57:48,393
Dolores?

1458
01:57:53,190 --> 01:57:55,483
And he said, "Take up your bed
and walk." But God?

1459
01:57:55,568 --> 01:57:56,610
Dolores?

1460
01:57:56,694 --> 01:58:00,780
Then he said, "Take up your bed
and walk." Forgive sins, but God?

1461
01:58:11,042 --> 01:58:12,417
Dolores?

1462
01:58:37,735 --> 01:58:38,985
Baby,

1463
01:58:41,030 --> 01:58:42,906
why are you all wet?

1464
01:58:45,242 --> 01:58:46,785
I missed you.

1465
01:58:54,168 --> 01:58:55,835
I wanna go home.

1466
01:58:58,964 --> 01:59:00,465
You are home.

1467
01:59:05,638 --> 01:59:07,472
Where are the kids?

1468
01:59:11,519 --> 01:59:13,269
They're in school.

1469
01:59:17,441 --> 01:59:19,442
It's Saturday, honey.

1470
01:59:20,611 --> 01:59:22,821
School's not in on Saturday.

1471
01:59:25,449 --> 01:59:27,075
My school is.

1472
01:59:40,423 --> 01:59:41,965
Oh, my God.

1473
01:59:44,260 --> 01:59:45,719
Oh, my God!

1474
01:59:58,858 --> 02:00:01,568
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1475
02:00:05,740 --> 02:00:07,323
Oh, my God, no.

1476
02:00:11,787 --> 02:00:13,496
Come on, come on.

1477
02:00:26,719 --> 02:00:29,846
No. No. Please, God.

1478
02:00:31,849 --> 02:00:35,643
Please, God, no! No!

1479
02:00:38,856 --> 02:00:50,366
No.

1480
02:01:34,745 --> 02:01:35,954
Baby.

1481
02:01:54,765 --> 02:01:57,267
Let's put them at the table, Andrew.

1482
02:01:58,102 --> 02:02:01,312
We'll dry them off.
We'll change their clothes.

1483
02:02:03,482 --> 02:02:05,608
They'll be our living dolls.

1484
02:02:09,947 --> 02:02:12,699
Tomorrow we can take them on a picnic.

1485
02:02:17,705 --> 02:02:22,208
If you ever loved me, Dolores,
please stop talking.

1486
02:02:28,799 --> 02:02:30,300
I love you.

1487
02:02:39,018 --> 02:02:40,602
Set me free.

1488
02:02:45,274 --> 02:02:46,691
Oh, baby.

1489
02:02:50,154 --> 02:02:52,071
We'll give them baths.

1490
02:02:55,326 --> 02:02:58,536
- I love you, baby.
- I love you, too.

1491
02:02:58,621 --> 02:03:00,413
- I love you so much.
- I love you so much.

1492
02:03:00,497 --> 02:03:02,248
I love you. I...

1493
02:03:26,106 --> 02:03:27,857
Oh, baby.

1494
02:03:33,822 --> 02:03:35,156
Andrew.

1495
02:03:37,201 --> 02:03:39,202
Andrew, can you hear me?

1496
02:03:39,495 --> 02:03:40,828
Rachel.

1497
02:03:41,705 --> 02:03:43,373
Rachel, Rachel.

1498
02:03:45,626 --> 02:03:46,918
Rachel?

1499
02:03:49,421 --> 02:03:50,880
Rachel who?

1500
02:03:53,759 --> 02:03:55,843
Rachel. Rachel Laeddis.

1501
02:03:57,012 --> 02:03:58,763
My daughter.

1502
02:04:02,351 --> 02:04:04,102
Why are you here?

1503
02:04:07,314 --> 02:04:08,856
Because I killed my wife.

1504
02:04:08,941 --> 02:04:11,067
And why did you do that?

1505
02:04:14,571 --> 02:04:17,740
Because she murdered our children,

1506
02:04:20,661 --> 02:04:22,078
and she told me to let her go.

1507
02:04:26,250 --> 02:04:29,419
- Who's Teddy Daniels?
- He doesn't exist.

1508
02:04:31,755 --> 02:04:34,215
Neither does Rachel Solando.
I made them up.

1509
02:04:34,299 --> 02:04:35,550
Why?

1510
02:04:36,885 --> 02:04:39,053
We need to hear you say it.

1511
02:04:44,852 --> 02:04:48,062
After she tried to kill herself
the first time,

1512
02:04:50,107 --> 02:04:52,066
Dolores told me she...

1513
02:04:53,027 --> 02:04:57,280
She had an insect living
inside her brain.

1514
02:04:59,283 --> 02:05:03,995
She could feel it
clicking across her skull,

1515
02:05:04,079 --> 02:05:08,291
just pulling the wires just for fun.

1516
02:05:11,962 --> 02:05:13,755
She told me that.

1517
02:05:15,215 --> 02:05:18,051
She told me that, but I didn't listen.

1518
02:05:21,764 --> 02:05:24,057
I loved her so much, you know.

1519
02:05:25,476 --> 02:05:27,643
Why did you make them up?

1520
02:05:29,730 --> 02:05:33,649
Because I can't take knowing
that Dolores killed our children.

1521
02:05:37,488 --> 02:05:38,821
And I...

1522
02:05:41,325 --> 02:05:45,828
I killed them 'cause I didn't get her help,
you know.

1523
02:05:50,042 --> 02:05:51,667
I killed them.

1524
02:05:56,465 --> 02:05:57,590
Here's my fear, Andrew.

1525
02:05:57,674 --> 02:06:00,885
We broke through once before,
nine months ago,

1526
02:06:00,969 --> 02:06:01,969
and then you regressed.

1527
02:06:04,515 --> 02:06:07,850
- I don't remember that.
- I know.

1528
02:06:09,353 --> 02:06:11,145
You reset, Andrew.

1529
02:06:11,605 --> 02:06:15,691
Like a tape playing over and over
on an endless loop.

1530
02:06:16,944 --> 02:06:18,402
I hope that what we've done here
will be enough

1531
02:06:18,487 --> 02:06:21,614
to stop it from ever happening again,

1532
02:06:21,698 --> 02:06:25,201
but I need to know
you've accepted reality.

1533
02:06:31,708 --> 02:06:34,460
You came after me, huh, Doctor?

1534
02:06:36,338 --> 02:06:40,216
You tried to help me
when no one else would.

1535
02:06:52,020 --> 02:06:54,897
My name's Andrew Laeddis,

1536
02:07:01,905 --> 02:07:05,366
and I murdered my wife
in the spring of '52.

1537
02:07:30,100 --> 02:07:33,561
- How we doing this morning?
- Good.

1538
02:07:33,645 --> 02:07:36,564
- And you?
- Can't complain.

1539
02:07:46,241 --> 02:07:50,203
- So what's our next move?
- You tell me.

1540
02:07:55,792 --> 02:08:00,087
We gotta get off this rock, Chuck.
Get back to the mainland.

1541
02:08:00,172 --> 02:08:03,132
Whatever the hell's going on here,
it's bad.

1542
02:08:25,072 --> 02:08:28,282
Don't worry, partner,
they're not gonna catch us.

1543
02:08:33,830 --> 02:08:36,666
That's right. We're too smart for them.

1544
02:08:37,793 --> 02:08:39,919
Yeah, we are, aren't we?

1545
02:08:55,560 --> 02:08:58,312
You know,
this place makes me wonder...

1546
02:08:58,855 --> 02:09:00,940
Yeah, what's that, boss?

1547
02:09:01,900 --> 02:09:03,859
Which would be worse,

1548
02:09:04,695 --> 02:09:08,823
to live as a monster
or to die as a good man?

1549
02:09:18,667 --> 02:09:19,959
Teddy?
