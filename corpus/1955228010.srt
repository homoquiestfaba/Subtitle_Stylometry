00:29:25,231 --> 00:29:27,066
Tell them I'm not the one,
please.

369
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:29,535
Don't let them
torture me, please.

370
00:29:29,568 --> 00:29:32,071
Mauricio's the one.
He's the one that's lying.

371
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:33,572
Tell them.
Tell them, please.

372
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:36,042
- Jesus, please.
- Don't play with me.

373
00:29:36,075 --> 00:29:38,110
- Come on, please.
- You are alone.

374
00:29:38,144 --> 00:29:40,346
Please, please help me now.

375
00:29:40,379 --> 00:29:42,915
No, I'm not the one.
It's Mauricio.

376
00:29:42,949 --> 00:29:46,218
He's the one that's lying,
not me, it's Mauricio.

377
00:29:46,252 --> 00:29:47,419
You tell 'em!

You can't do this.

384
00:30:11,944 --> 00:30:14,613
Hey, you can't do this to me!

385
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:17,516
Please! Please!

386
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:19,418

399
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,496
Hello.

400
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:08,200
[MAN] Mrs. Owens, before
I start, I want to tell you...

401
00:31:08,234 --> 00:31:11,137
Look, I don't know if you
realize who are you talking to,

402
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:13,305
But I swear if you hang up...

403
00:31:13,339 --> 00:31:15,207
I'm perfectly aware
of who I'm talking to

404
00:31:15,241 --> 00:31:17,209
And how delicate
the situation is.

405
00:31:17,243 --> 00:31:20,279
Okay, so you know I'll be
at the door of the ministry

406
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:21,480
In 15 minutes,

407
00:31:21,513 --> 00:31:23,415
Waiting for them
to open the door for me.

408
00:31:23,449 --> 00:31:26,118
Sorry, ma'am, but I don't think
we have that much time.

409
00:31:26,152 --> 00:31:27,586
Why?

410
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:31,090
Local law enforcement
and the Colombian Army

411
00:31:31,123 --> 00:31:34,026
Have found your husband's
possible location.

412
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:36,162
Is he all right?
Where is he?

413
00:31:36,195 --> 00:31:39,131
The vehicle assigned
to your husband by our company

414
00:31:39,165 --> 00:31:41,300
Has a satellite
tracking system.

415
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:43,169
Wait, what?

416
00:31:43,202 --> 00:31:45,037
So you knew where he was
from the beginning

417
00:31:45,071 --> 00:31:46,705
And you
only mention it now?

418
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,507
Oh, not quite.

419
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:52,078
Do you know how much trouble
you and your company are in?

420
00:31:52,111 --> 00:31:53,946
We're not liable
for these events,

421
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,547
But we are doing
everything in our power.

422
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:58,250
No, excuse me, excuse me!

423
00:31:58,284 --> 00:32:00,552
You're not going to
get out of this so easily!

424
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:03,455
Ma'am, we don't have time
to argue!

425
00:32:03,489 --> 00:32:08,360
The most important issue
is your husband.

426
00:32:08,394 --> 00:32:12,031
Okay. Why do you say
we don't have much time?

427
00:32:12,064 --> 00:32:14,500
Right. Approximately
two hours ago,

428
00:32:14,533 --> 00:32:19,972
An army anti-kidnapping unit
went by land and surrounded

429
00:32:20,006 --> 00:32:23,375
The point where we think
your husband is located.

430
00:32:23,409 --> 00:32:28,380
I'm personally on a helicopter
that'll provide air support.

431
00:32:28,414 --> 00:32:31,050
So why haven't you
rescued him yet?

432
00:32:31,083 --> 00:32:34,453
Over land travel
takes time, Mrs. Owens.

433
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:38,690
You have to promise me
you'll bring him back alive.

434
00:32:38,724 --> 00:32:42,361
That's precisely
why I'm calling.

435
00:32:42,394 --> 00:32:45,597
Mauricio Yacca's parents have
approved the armed incursion,

436
00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:50,369
And we have their sign-off
for a hostile extraction.

437
00:32:50,402 --> 00:32:54,740
You have to promise me
you'll bring him back alive.

438
00:32:54,773 --> 00:32:57,476
I'm sorry, ma'am,
I can't do that,

439
00:32:57,509 --> 00:33:01,347
But I do need your sign-off
to execute the operation.

440
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,382
No, I can't.

441
00:33:03,415 --> 00:33:05,384
I have to consult
with my family first.

442
00:33:05,417 --> 00:33:07,686
Excuse me, ma'am,
we don't have time.

443
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:12,224
The team will be on site
and in position in 15 minutes.

444
00:33:12,258 --> 00:33:14,126
And the sun's about to rise.

445
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,495
If that happens,
we lose our tactical edge.

446
00:33:16,528 --> 00:33:20,132
No, I can't, I can't.

447
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:23,202
Ma'am, I need your answer now.

448
00:33:23,235 --> 00:33:27,273
Will you authorize
a Colombian Army operation

449
00:33:27,306 --> 00:33:29,808
To perform
a hostile extraction

450
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:33,179
Of American citizen
Mark Owens?

451
00:33:33,212 --> 00:33:36,282
Please answer yes or no.

452
00:33:36,315 --> 00:33:39,118
I can't.

453
00:33:39,151 --> 00:33:43,322
I can't decide that.

454
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:46,158
Do I take that
as a negative?

455
00:33:46,192 --> 00:33:48,160
I need you to understand

456
00:33:48,194 --> 00:33:51,797
I will be forced
to abort the operation.

457
00:33:53,099 --> 00:33:55,634
Wait, wait.

458
00:33:56,735 --> 00:33:58,770
- Do it, do it.
- Okay.

459
00:33:58,804 --> 00:34:02,308
In regard to your decision,
we wish to repeat

460
00:34:02,341 --> 00:34:06,078
That our company
is not liable in any way

461
00:34:06,112 --> 00:34:10,082
And that we are joining
the operation as observers.

462
00:34:10,116 --> 00:34:13,119
- Is this clear to you?
- Yes

463
00:34:13,152 --> 00:34:15,554
Mrs. Owens,
in the name of our firm,

464
00:34:15,587 --> 00:34:17,789
We wish to ratify
our concern about...

465
00:34:19,325 --> 00:34:20,659
[MAN] Mrs. Owens?

466
00:34:22,228 --> 00:34:24,796

You gonna get both killed.
Please, where is the key?

I don't know about any key.
I don't know.

a password or something?

I don't know. I don't know

any key, I swear to God!

- I'm just an engineer.
- No, you're not an engineer.

486
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,642
Your friend says
that you are the boss.

487
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:18,744
- Who?
- Your friend Mauricio!

488

He's not my friend.

I don't know what the hell
he's talking about.

anything about banks.

They got into the bank.

492

Mauricio has told them
everything.

493
00:36:29,455 --> 00:36:31,690
Now they need a fucking key
to transfer the money.

494
00:36:31,723 --> 00:36:34,593
I don't know!
I don't have any key.

You don't know Mauricio?

a son of the owner.

He knows more about
the bank accounts,

514

About all the information,
he knows all that.

Don't be saying that.

534
00:39:54,526 --> 00:39:57,062
Why you choose Carla
and not me?

Why you pick her?

I don't know,
I can't remember.

00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,616

00:40:43,108 --> 00:40:49,047
We worked together many years,
so yeah, she was my friend.

543
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:52,718
- You guys are like escorts?
- Hookers?

544
00:40:52,751 --> 00:40:55,020
I was gonna say escorts.

545
00:40:55,053 --> 00:40:59,658
No, no, no. What's the problem
to being a fucking whore?

546
00:41:01,092 --> 00:41:02,561
I'm sorry.

547
00:41:02,594 --> 00:41:05,096
- I just, um...
- No, no, no.

548
00:41:06,632 --> 00:41:09,668
Have you ever been
with a whore?

549
00:41:09,701 --> 00:41:12,971
'Cause last night
you were fucking one.

550
00:41:13,004 --> 00:41:15,240
I wasn't fucking her.

551
00:41:17,275 --> 00:41:18,243
[Chuckles]

552
00:41:18,276 --> 00:41:20,211
Why's that?

553
00:41:23,949 --> 00:41:27,586
Maybe you couldn't get it up,
but you want to fuck her.

554
00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:29,855
Is it not the same?

555
00:41:34,893 --> 00:41:38,564
[Distant screaming]

556
00:41:38,597 --> 00:41:40,766
Jesus Christ.

557
00:41:54,613 --> 00:41:57,015
Are you friends
with Mauricio?

558
00:42:01,787 --> 00:42:05,624
I know him for a year,
almost a year.

559
00:42:05,657 --> 00:42:07,726
Together we make fun
of the other girls

560
00:42:07,759 --> 00:42:11,930
Because he like to act
like a gringo.

561
00:42:11,963 --> 00:42:15,033
I thought maybe you guys were
good friends or something.

562
00:42:15,066 --> 00:42:18,203
I thought he was
full of shit, you know?

563
00:42:18,236 --> 00:42:21,106
When he's sober,
he's this quiet guy.

564
00:42:21,139 --> 00:42:23,174
But when he gets drunk,

565
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:27,579
He's like, he likes to play
el gran señor.

566
00:42:33,619 --> 00:42:35,621
You have a boyfriend?

567
00:42:35,654 --> 00:42:37,055
A boyfriend?

568
00:42:37,088 --> 00:42:38,957
Yeah, I mean, why not?

569
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:41,593
Why can't a girl like you
have a boyfriend?

570
00:42:41,627 --> 00:42:43,662
[Speaking Spanish]

571
00:42:43,695 --> 00:42:46,932
All my clients
are my boyfriends.

572
00:42:53,104 --> 00:42:55,641
You speak pretty good English.

573
00:42:55,674 --> 00:42:56,742
Thanks.

574
00:42:56,775 --> 00:42:58,343
Where'd you learn?

575
00:42:58,376 --> 00:43:00,879
I took some classes.

576
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:02,948
- Some classes?
- Yeah.

577
00:43:02,981 --> 00:43:04,616
Why?

578
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:06,718
Don't laugh at me, please.

579
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:11,389
A friend of mine,
she get married with a gringo,

580
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:15,827
And I just wake up
and say to me like,

581
00:43:15,861 --> 00:43:18,363
"I want that for me."

582
00:43:18,396 --> 00:43:20,732
What happened?

583
00:43:25,136 --> 00:43:27,673
I just ended like a whore.

584
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:33,278
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no, don't be sorry.

585
00:43:33,311 --> 00:43:35,013
I don't regret it.

586
00:43:35,046 --> 00:43:38,083
Knowing English
has given me so much.

587
00:43:40,251 --> 00:43:42,721
How's that?

588
00:43:42,754 --> 00:43:47,225
Look, all the gringos
are coming to Colombia,

589
00:43:47,258 --> 00:43:51,262
And you guys rather have
a girl like Carla than me,

590
00:43:51,296 --> 00:43:54,365
So knowing English
give me extra money.

591
00:43:54,399 --> 00:43:57,803
So why would you want
to marry an American?

592
00:43:57,836 --> 00:44:03,308
Every girl in Colombia
wants to marry a boy like you.

593
00:44:07,345 --> 00:44:09,280
Do you have a girlfriend?

594
00:44:10,348 --> 00:44:11,817
Four.

595
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:14,419
You have four girlfriends?
Look at you!

596
00:44:14,452 --> 00:44:17,222
[Laughs]

597
00:44:17,255 --> 00:44:20,358
I have four girlfriends
altogether.

598
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:25,764
You only slept
with four women...

599
00:44:25,797 --> 00:44:28,233
In your entire life?

600
00:44:33,271 --> 00:44:38,043
No. I've slept with six.

601
00:44:38,076 --> 00:44:39,711
Seven.

602
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:43,414
Do you have a girlfriend?

603
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:51,923
I was married,
or I'm married.

604
00:44:51,957 --> 00:44:56,061
Are you married
or divorced or what?

605
00:44:56,094 --> 00:45:00,365
No, I'm married, but I...

606
00:45:02,233 --> 00:45:05,436
I don't know what's gonna
happen now. I mean...

607
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:08,273
Nothing's gonna happen
because nothing happened.

608
00:45:08,306 --> 00:45:10,341
- Yeah, right.
- Nothing happened, Mark.

609
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:12,978
You know, it just was...

610
00:45:13,011 --> 00:45:17,215
The night is good,
the meat is weak.

611
00:45:17,248 --> 00:45:19,951
Who's gonna tell her?
No one.

612
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:29,494
[Distant screaming]

613
00:45:29,527 --> 00:45:32,297
[Screaming continues]

614
00:45:39,404 --> 00:45:40,839
We're gonna die.

615
00:45:40,872 --> 00:45:43,208
No, we're not gonna die.

616
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:45,010
How do you know that?

617
00:45:45,043 --> 00:45:47,145
Because I know.

618
00:45:52,183 --> 00:45:55,186
We're gonna get out of here.
Everything's gonna be okay.

619
00:45:56,822 --> 00:45:58,790
Now just...

620
00:46:03,995 --> 00:46:06,064
Listen to me.

621
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:08,934
I'm gonna take you
to the United States with me.

622
00:46:08,967 --> 00:46:11,236
We're gonna get the hell
out of here,

623
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:14,472
And everything is
gonna be fine.

624
00:46:14,505 --> 00:46:15,473
I promise.

625
00:46:19,144 --> 00:46:21,512
I'm a whore,
but I'm not stupid.

626
00:46:21,546 --> 00:46:23,915
- I don't lie.
- How can you help me?

627
00:46:23,949 --> 00:46:25,817
I help people like you
all the time.

628
00:46:25,851 --> 00:46:29,187
I help people
that help people like you.

629
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:32,157
- Are you a priest or something?
- No!

630
00:46:35,961 --> 00:46:38,329
I can get you out of here.

631
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:48,273
Please, I'm serious.

632
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:51,042
Don't never promise something
that you can't accomplish.

633
00:46:51,076 --> 00:46:53,244
We're gonna get out of here.

634
00:46:53,278 --> 00:46:54,846
- Yes, we are.
- No.

635
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,447
If you don't talk about
the password,

636
00:46:56,481 --> 00:46:58,016
They're gonna kill us.

637
00:46:58,049 --> 00:46:59,885
I don't fucking know
about any of that.

638
00:46:59,918 --> 00:47:02,553
I don't know any banks,
I don't know about the key.

639
00:47:02,587 --> 00:47:03,989
Let me explain to you
something

640
00:47:04,022 --> 00:47:05,924
Because I think
you don't get it.

641
00:47:05,957 --> 00:47:07,492
They're not playing any games.

642
00:47:07,525 --> 00:47:09,360
If you don't tell them
what they want,

643
00:47:09,394 --> 00:47:11,262
They're gonna torture you
and murder us.

644
00:47:11,296 --> 00:47:12,998
No, you listen to me,
goddamn it.

645
00:47:13,031 --> 00:47:14,966
If we tell those motherfuckers
what they want,

646
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,936
They're gonna come over here
and they're gonna kill us.

647
00:47:17,969 --> 00:47:19,304
I don't want to die here.

648
00:47:19,337 --> 00:47:21,339
Okay, we're gonna
get out of here.

649
00:47:21,372 --> 00:47:23,008
We got a deal?

650
00:47:23,041 --> 00:47:25,543
- We got a deal?
- They're coming.

Okay, what's going on?

659
00:47:57,608 --> 00:48:01,947
They got into the bank,
but they blocked the account.

[Speaking Spanish]

661
00:48:04,615 --> 00:48:06,017

- What?
- Yeah.

663
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:10,455
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah.

664
00:48:14,692 --> 00:48:16,294
What's wrong with you?

665
00:48:16,327 --> 00:48:19,464
- Why did you tell them?
- What?

666
00:48:19,497 --> 00:48:23,068
They're gonna bring Mauricio,
and they're gonna torture him!

667
00:48:23,101 --> 00:48:24,970
They are gonna be
torturing you!

668
00:48:25,003 --> 00:48:26,271
So now they're gonna
torture him?

669
00:48:26,304 --> 00:48:28,139
- Do you want to live?
- Yes!

670
00:48:28,173 --> 00:48:30,575
Try not to be
so fucking naive, Mark.

671
00:48:30,608 --> 00:48:33,378
Okay, do you realize
what we're into here?

672
00:48:33,411 --> 00:48:34,980
- Yes.
- So?

673
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:38,549
Look, I was with him,

674
00:48:38,583 --> 00:48:42,220
And he's not that faithful dog
that you think he is.

675
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:45,656
Look, if he dies,
it's gonna be...

676
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:50,228
The only thing left that
they need is the access key.

677
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:52,230
That's it.

678
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:54,232
Do you know something
about the fucking key, Mark?

679
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:55,233
No!

680
00:48:55,266 --> 00:48:57,035
So?

681
00:48:58,436 --> 00:49:00,171
We just need to buy time.

682
00:49:00,205 --> 00:49:02,307

683
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:04,475

- Who? Who's gonna save us?

687

We're in the fucking middle
of the jungle in Colombia!

- They've got their ways!
- Who? Who fucking who?

689
00:49:15,653 --> 00:49:17,155
The embassy!
They're gonna be here.

690

get us out of here.

01:02:43,828 --> 01:02:46,831
I want to see if you can
keep your mouth shut

899
01:02:46,864 --> 01:02:48,465
When that guy over there
comes over

900
01:02:48,498 --> 01:02:50,567
And cuts one finger off,

901
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:55,572
Then cuts another finger off
and socks you.

902
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:58,976
What the fuck has
Vanessa told you?

903
01:02:59,009 --> 01:03:01,011
She didn't have
to tell me anything.

904
01:03:01,045 --> 01:03:03,814
You've been giving them
all the information they want.

905
01:03:03,848 --> 01:03:07,051
What have I told them, Mark?
What have I told them?

906
01:03:07,084 --> 01:03:09,286
Man, they're fucking
in all the banks.

907
01:03:09,319 --> 01:03:10,955
They got all the information.

908
01:03:10,988 --> 01:03:12,389
I don't know.
Is it a miracle?

909
01:03:12,422 --> 01:03:14,992
I didn't do it.
I didn't give it to them.

910
01:03:15,025 --> 01:03:18,295
It's all a lie.

911
01:03:18,328 --> 01:03:20,998
It's a fucking lie?
How do you know it's a lie

912
01:03:21,031 --> 01:03:23,467
If you don't even know
what she's been saying?

913
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:26,403
Okay, what has she said?

914
01:03:28,605 --> 01:03:31,075
She tells me you get tortured,
you tell them everything.

915
01:03:31,108 --> 01:03:33,143
They've got all the information
for the bank,

916
01:03:33,177 --> 01:03:35,012
And the only thing
that's left is the key.

917
01:03:35,045 --> 01:03:39,016
All right, and you're gonna
tell them how it works.

918
01:03:39,049 --> 01:03:41,285
Jesus, Mauricio, if I don't
tell 'em how it works,

919
01:03:41,318 --> 01:03:42,887
They're gonna kill you.

920
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:46,223
That's what
the fucking whore told you.

921
01:03:46,256 --> 01:03:48,458
Why do you give a shit
what she says?

922
01:03:48,492 --> 01:03:51,628
Come on, she's the only one
that's trying to help me here.

923
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:53,931
She's so nice to you.

924
01:03:56,433 --> 01:03:58,202
Come on.
If we don't help her,

925
01:03:58,235 --> 01:04:00,137
She's gonna be the first one
they're gonna kill.

926
01:04:01,972 --> 01:04:04,541
What do you want me
to do about it, huh?

927
01:04:04,574 --> 01:04:07,444
Well, I'm not
gonna let her die.

928
01:04:07,477 --> 01:04:10,547
I'm not gonna let those
fucking bastards kill her.

929
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:12,582
Why do you care so much
about her?

930
01:04:20,624 --> 01:04:24,394
That blonde girl, Mauricio,
they fucking killed her.

931
01:04:24,428 --> 01:04:26,296
She told me.
She said...

932
01:04:26,330 --> 01:04:29,199
She said that they
weren't kidding around,

933
01:04:29,233 --> 01:04:31,635
They weren't fucking around,
that they were gonna kill her.

934
01:04:31,668 --> 01:04:33,603
And I didn't believe her,
and they killed her.

935
01:04:33,637 --> 01:04:35,940
It's my fault.

936
01:04:35,973 --> 01:04:38,208
It's my fault she's dead.

937
01:04:38,242 --> 01:04:40,344
Who, Carla?

938
01:04:40,377 --> 01:04:43,547
She's just a whore, man,
a piece of meat.

939
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:46,616
Look, I'm not gonna die
because of you or anybody.

940
01:04:46,650 --> 01:04:48,418
Oh, wow, that's a big
fucking surprise.

941
01:04:48,452 --> 01:04:50,387
What is that
supposed to mean?

942
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:53,090
You have no fucking dignity!
You have no honor!

943
01:04:53,123 --> 01:04:55,425
Jesus, you're disgusting!

944
01:04:55,459 --> 01:04:57,327
You're fucking worthless,
Mauricio.

946
01:05:02,566 --> 01:05:03,667

Goddamn fucking move!

948
01:05:11,241 --> 01:05:13,643
Jesus. She deserved
to fucking live.

949
01:05:13,677 --> 01:05:16,213
She's a human being.

950
01:05:16,246 --> 01:05:19,683
She deserved to live
just as much as you or me.

951
01:05:21,485 --> 01:05:24,488
Really? More than me?

952
01:05:24,521 --> 01:05:28,993
Yeah! Hell yeah! She...
It's our fault she's here.

953
01:05:29,026 --> 01:05:33,363
Hey, if I had to pick
between her and myself,

954
01:05:33,397 --> 01:05:34,664
I'm gonna pick myself.

955
01:05:34,698 --> 01:05:36,466
I'm not a fucking idiot
like you are.

956
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:39,469
No, you're not.

957
01:05:39,503 --> 01:05:41,438
You're a fucking loser.

958
01:05:44,541 --> 01:05:47,044
I'm practical, Mark.
I'm practical.

959
01:05:47,077 --> 01:05:48,512
Let me ask you something.

960
01:05:48,545 --> 01:05:51,281
They asked Vanessa to choose
between herself and you.

961
01:05:51,315 --> 01:05:53,350
Who the fuck do you think
she would pick?

962
01:05:53,383 --> 01:05:56,053
Jesus, Mauricio, I couldn't
make a decision like that

963
01:05:56,086 --> 01:05:58,222
Out here
in the fucking jungle.

964
01:05:58,255 --> 01:06:00,457
Of course not.

965
01:06:00,490 --> 01:06:02,492
You're such a goddamn
fucking noble prick.

966
01:06:02,526 --> 01:06:05,362
You know what? I don't give
a fuck what you think of me.

967
01:06:05,395 --> 01:06:07,397
Look...

[Groans]

969
01:06:09,466 --> 01:06:13,537
We all know I don't really care
what they're gonna do to me.

970
01:06:13,570 --> 01:06:16,473
But we've gotta stick together
and gain some time.

971
01:06:16,506 --> 01:06:18,708
Time? What, are you
fucking kidding me?

972
01:06:18,742 --> 01:06:22,446
We're doomed! Jesus Christ!
They're gonna fucking come here!

973
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:25,349
I got a fucking wife!
They're gonna come here!

974
01:06:25,382 --> 01:06:27,117
They're gonna
fucking kill us!

975
01:06:27,151 --> 01:06:30,187
We're worth so much more
alive than dead! Get that!

976
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:32,256
They're gonna come back
any moment now!

977
01:06:32,289 --> 01:06:35,259
They're gonna torture us!
We gotta stick together!

978
01:06:35,292 --> 01:06:38,795
Okay, just tell them about
my fucking family, all right?

979
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:41,131
Look, I don't know.
They can negotiate something.

980
01:06:41,165 --> 01:06:43,800
That will give us time.
You speak fucking Spanish.

981
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:46,036
You tell them
about my fucking family.

982
01:06:46,070 --> 01:06:50,474
They don't want any money.
We just gotta stick together.

[Distant door closes]

984
01:06:59,083 --> 01:07:02,219
- Fuck.
- I think they're coming back.

01:07:02,252 --> 01:07:04,588
Oh, shit.

[VANESSA] Mauricio told him
there was $6 million

In the bank.

- [Speaking Spanish]
- Everything was okay.

01:08:09,619 --> 01:08:12,356

1002
01:08:13,790 --> 01:08:15,425

1006

We have a deal.

What deal?

1008
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:38,382
[MARK] I don't know
the password.

1009
01:08:38,415 --> 01:08:40,850
This is not the perfect moment
to play games, Mark.

1010
01:08:40,884 --> 01:08:44,488
Tell me what the fuck
is going on here, man.

1011
01:08:44,521 --> 01:08:46,756
I don't have a deal with him.

1012
01:08:46,790 --> 01:08:48,258
[VANESSA] Don't lie to me, Mark!

1013
01:08:48,292 --> 01:08:50,794
- I'm not lying.
- Bullshit!

1014

You had the key
from the beginning.

Do you remember putting
your jeans on last night?

1016
01:08:59,703 --> 01:09:03,207
You put it in my fucking pants!
It's his fucking bank!

1017
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:06,576

the key on my pants?

And she moaned and squealed
like a fucking hog?
