1
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,292
Tibburon!

2
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:28,827
I know it's you.

3
00:00:28,828 --> 00:00:31,533
Show yourself!

4
00:00:34,533 --> 00:00:35,736
Tibburon!

5
00:00:37,736 --> 00:00:38,823
Where are you, huh?

6
00:00:57,823 --> 00:00:59,593
It's tiburon.

7
00:01:00,593 --> 00:01:02,273
Get me out of these chains.

8
00:01:14,273 --> 00:01:19,443
And you called me to
a peace conference

9
00:01:19,444 --> 00:01:21,349
and then tried to kill me.

10
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:24,229
That's your own fault,

11
00:01:25,016 --> 00:01:27,418
tiburon.

12
00:01:27,419 --> 00:01:30,590
You buried what the cartel
built for years.

13
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:35,292
They found you,
and they'll find you again.

14
00:01:35,293 --> 00:01:37,399
They're never
gonna stop hunting you.

15
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:42,800
If I was you,

16
00:01:42,801 --> 00:01:44,040
I'd get my house in order.

17
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,042
You know the game?

18
00:01:51,043 --> 00:01:53,881
I'm not playing your game.

19
00:01:55,881 --> 00:01:58,888
I'll face my death like a man.

20
00:02:02,888 --> 00:02:06,661
Well, you've got 15 seconds.

21
00:02:18,836 --> 00:02:21,577
No. No, no, no, no. No.

22
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:26,082
No. No.

23
00:02:31,082 --> 00:02:32,156
F...

24
00:02:37,156 --> 00:02:38,702
15 seconds.

25
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:50,686
12 seconds.

26
00:03:07,686 --> 00:03:09,997
Seven seconds.

27
00:03:18,997 --> 00:03:20,078
Five seconds.

28
00:03:33,078 --> 00:03:34,846
3...

29
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:36,847
2...

30
00:03:36,848 --> 00:03:39,752
1.

31
00:03:40,752 --> 00:03:42,056
Too late.

32
00:04:12,016 --> 00:04:14,197
Not very manly.

33
00:05:23,021 --> 00:05:26,790
Yes, the other case
is pushed to 10:30,

34
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:28,627
I believe, so we're
gonna be good on time.

35
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:30,536
Thanks again.

36
00:05:58,956 --> 00:06:00,699
Brian?

37
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:08,569
Brian?

38
00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:12,668
I didn't do a thing.

39
00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:13,969
We don't give a shit.

40
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:14,470
I--

41
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,716
Thank you.

42
00:06:57,716 --> 00:06:59,028
Wh--hey!

43
00:07:10,028 --> 00:07:11,229
No, seriously.

44
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,230
Yeah. Look,
fax over the documents,

45
00:07:13,231 --> 00:07:15,632
and I'll get it to you back
later today.

46
00:07:15,633 --> 00:07:17,634
No, no, it's good.
Good. That's gonna work.

47
00:07:17,635 --> 00:07:19,368
I'm telling you.
I know this guy.

48
00:07:19,369 --> 00:07:21,404
I know her.
It's gonna be all right.

49
00:07:21,405 --> 00:07:22,708
It's really not a problem.

50
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:23,874
Mr. holt.

51
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:26,298
What--Jack,
I'll call you back.

52
00:09:13,184 --> 00:09:14,087
Hey...

53
00:09:16,087 --> 00:09:17,821
Are you okay?

54
00:09:17,822 --> 00:09:19,092
Who are you?

55
00:09:21,092 --> 00:09:23,127
I'm Cal.
Are you all right?

56
00:09:23,128 --> 00:09:24,767
Where are we?

57
00:09:28,767 --> 00:09:30,268
I don't know.

58
00:09:56,394 --> 00:10:00,932
None of you are here by chance.

59
00:10:01,932 --> 00:10:04,335
You're here...

60
00:10:04,336 --> 00:10:08,605
Because of your actions.

61
00:10:08,606 --> 00:10:12,843
Do you always drug
and shackle your guests?

62
00:10:12,844 --> 00:10:15,713
Shh, shh, shh.
Be quiet.

63
00:10:15,714 --> 00:10:17,519
It's about to begin.

64
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:23,421
We're about...

65
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:24,957
To play a game...

66
00:10:26,957 --> 00:10:30,033
Of life and death.

67
00:10:36,033 --> 00:10:37,769
Whoever you think I am...

68
00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:39,769
Whatever you think I did,

69
00:10:40,004 --> 00:10:42,047
there's no way
that I deserve to die.

70
00:10:49,047 --> 00:10:50,047
Wait. No.

71
00:10:50,048 --> 00:10:51,549
No! No!

72
00:10:53,985 --> 00:10:55,679
Oh, my God!

73
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:23,932
No.

74
00:11:41,932 --> 00:11:43,236
Pups.

75
00:11:45,236 --> 00:11:48,774
Some bull, some blue, some...

76
00:11:50,107 --> 00:11:51,610
Threshers.

77
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:55,580
And the thing about the
sharks is they're--

78
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:58,884
they're only--
they're only babies.

79
00:11:59,884 --> 00:12:02,220
They're only less
than two months old,

80
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:06,290
but far more sophisticated
and independent

81
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:09,759
than humans 20 times their age.

82
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,931
That's the thing about sharks.

83
00:12:13,932 --> 00:12:14,931
Heh.

84
00:12:14,932 --> 00:12:17,701
They enter the world

85
00:12:17,702 --> 00:12:20,237
prepared for the world

86
00:12:20,238 --> 00:12:25,909
because of 20 million
years of evolution.

87
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:28,579
They're just
garbage cans of the sea.

88
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:31,080
No. No.

89
00:12:31,081 --> 00:12:34,253
They're--they're
predatory perfection.

90
00:12:35,253 --> 00:12:37,120
They don't sleep.

91
00:12:37,121 --> 00:12:38,589
They don't retreat.

92
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:41,992
They don't get fatigued or ill.

93
00:12:41,993 --> 00:12:44,295
They swim, and they feed,

94
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:48,599
and they mate.
Sharks are life.

95
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:53,671
They're the oldest and purest
forms of being on this world.

96
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:54,774
They're gods.

97
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:57,447
They should be revered.

98
00:13:03,447 --> 00:13:04,568
So that's how it's gonna be?

99
00:13:05,015 --> 00:13:06,918
You're gonna feed us
to baby sharks?

100
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:09,355
The thing is...

101
00:13:11,355 --> 00:13:13,791
This pool is a gateway,

102
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:17,663
and the pups are sentinels.

103
00:13:18,663 --> 00:13:21,798
If you can enter,

104
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:24,441
you can get to a pathway...

105
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:33,310
And your challenge is to
move along that pathway

106
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:37,683
from this side of the
island to the other.

107
00:13:39,683 --> 00:13:41,684
Yeah, well, what's the catch?

108
00:13:41,685 --> 00:13:43,788
Oh, there's no catch, no catch,

109
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:45,656
no catch whatsoever.

110
00:13:45,657 --> 00:13:48,125
There are a few
challenges along the way,

111
00:13:48,126 --> 00:13:51,061
but each day, you're
going to encounter

112
00:13:51,062 --> 00:13:54,636
another different kind
of species of shark.

113
00:13:58,636 --> 00:14:01,673
If you kill that shark...

114
00:14:02,673 --> 00:14:06,911
I, being the kind man that I am,

115
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:09,812
will, uh, give you a reward

116
00:14:09,813 --> 00:14:12,249
to survive the next shark,

117
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:15,819
but only, only a bit.

118
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,186
You're sick.

119
00:14:17,187 --> 00:14:21,358
Do not say that again, or...

120
00:14:21,359 --> 00:14:23,893
I'll cut out your tongue.

121
00:14:23,894 --> 00:14:26,695
If you wanted to kill us,
why'd you bring us here?

122
00:14:26,696 --> 00:14:29,735
Why didn't you just do it
when you had the chance?

123
00:14:30,735 --> 00:14:33,671
Revenge...

124
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:36,741
Is like a fine wine.

125
00:14:37,741 --> 00:14:39,944
If you have it,

126
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:42,184
why not linger over it?

127
00:14:47,184 --> 00:14:49,787
If you play,

128
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:50,388
you might live.

129
00:14:52,222 --> 00:14:54,193
If you refuse...

130
00:14:56,193 --> 00:14:59,436
You are guaranteed a death.

131
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:06,203
How's that for motivation?

132
00:15:08,239 --> 00:15:10,206
Oh, you'll be tempted

133
00:15:10,207 --> 00:15:12,543
to swim straight
for the escape hatch,

134
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:15,211
and that is not
in your best interest.

135
00:15:15,212 --> 00:15:19,782
See, one of the pups is wearing a
collar with the key around it,

136
00:15:19,783 --> 00:15:21,121
so find the puppy.

137
00:15:24,121 --> 00:15:25,589
Find the puppy.

138
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:26,724
- No!
- No!

139
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:28,425
No!

140
00:15:28,426 --> 00:15:30,728
- No!
- Don't! Don't!

141
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:32,764
No, you son of a bitch! No!

142
00:15:44,509 --> 00:15:45,510
Look for the key!

143
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:54,357
They're everywhere!

144
00:16:00,357 --> 00:16:01,557
- Where is it?!
- I don't know!

145
00:16:06,163 --> 00:16:08,533
They're eating me alive!

146
00:16:09,533 --> 00:16:10,413
They're not dangerous.

147
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:12,757
Just bat 'em away.

148
00:16:23,514 --> 00:16:26,149
I got it!

149
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,550
I think he's got the key.

150
00:16:27,551 --> 00:16:28,820
Swim towards the gate.

151
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,120
Come on!

152
00:16:31,121 --> 00:16:32,691
Hurry! Open it!

153
00:16:33,691 --> 00:16:35,630
Francine! Swim!

154
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:39,837
Go next, ragan.

155
00:16:54,979 --> 00:16:57,648
Hmm. They all
made it through.

156
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:00,988
Okay, okay.

157
00:17:03,988 --> 00:17:05,991
Where are we?

158
00:17:07,991 --> 00:17:11,361
We made it to the beach.

159
00:17:11,362 --> 00:17:14,431
No, I think it's
just a sand barge.

160
00:17:14,432 --> 00:17:15,901
Make room.

161
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,838
What do we do now?

162
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,374
We've gotta swim to shore.

163
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,508
I'm not getting

164
00:17:24,509 --> 00:17:26,546
back in that water
until daylight.

165
00:17:28,546 --> 00:17:31,914
Well, that shouldn't
be much longer.

166
00:17:31,915 --> 00:17:34,923
Let's just try to rest here
until daybreak.

167
00:17:38,923 --> 00:17:39,941
Oh, God.

168
00:17:56,941 --> 00:18:00,277
What--baby, what are
you talking about?

169
00:18:00,278 --> 00:18:01,979
You--
I want to stay.

170
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,646
Leave me.

171
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,385
No.

172
00:18:08,385 --> 00:18:10,720
Come on, sweet tibu.

173
00:18:10,721 --> 00:18:12,122
Let me just watch.

174
00:18:12,123 --> 00:18:14,591
You know how I love to watch.

175
00:18:14,592 --> 00:18:16,597
This is not a game!

176
00:18:20,597 --> 00:18:22,466
If you don't leave me,

177
00:18:22,467 --> 00:18:25,650
I might feed you
to the sharks as well!

178
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:39,355
Asshole.

179
00:18:44,355 --> 00:18:47,790
Good morning, everyone.
I hope you slept well.

180
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:51,632
We have an exciting day
ahead of us.

181
00:18:57,568 --> 00:18:59,904
Jesus Christ!

182
00:19:00,904 --> 00:19:02,073
Better get used to it.

183
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:04,508
How can you be so flippant?

184
00:19:04,509 --> 00:19:07,344
We're pawns
in this psycho's game.

185
00:19:07,345 --> 00:19:10,179
Well, how the hell do you expect
me to act, lady? Hysterical?

186
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,846
How's that gonna help things?

187
00:19:11,847 --> 00:19:13,553
Enough!
Is everyone okay?

188
00:19:15,553 --> 00:19:17,386
They got me all over.

189
00:19:17,387 --> 00:19:19,088
They got all of us.

190
00:19:19,089 --> 00:19:20,424
Is anyone badly hurt?

191
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:21,592
No.

192
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:23,160
I'll live.

193
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:25,336
Yeah, but for how long?

194
00:19:32,336 --> 00:19:35,338
All right, down to business.

195
00:19:35,339 --> 00:19:36,942
Let me see that.

196
00:19:37,942 --> 00:19:39,576
Oh, my God.

197
00:19:39,577 --> 00:19:41,849
The key unlocks our handcuffs.

198
00:19:45,849 --> 00:19:47,921
Thanks.

199
00:19:49,921 --> 00:19:51,517
Hey.

200
00:20:19,517 --> 00:20:22,152
Who is that lunatic?

201
00:20:22,153 --> 00:20:23,987
You're here now.

202
00:20:23,988 --> 00:20:26,324
Playing stupid
ain't gonna help you.

203
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:29,560
He's Ethan McKay, aka tiburon.

204
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,998
You mean that drug trafficker?

205
00:20:33,998 --> 00:20:36,000
But what that's
gotta do with me?

206
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,971
I'm an EMT.

207
00:20:39,971 --> 00:20:42,905
What are we gonna do?
I don't want to die.

208
00:20:42,906 --> 00:20:45,509
Don't know about the rest of you guys.
I'm gonna be just fine.

209
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,310
You don't know that.

210
00:20:47,311 --> 00:20:48,979
I do know that.

211
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,181
I planned. I'm prepared.

212
00:20:51,182 --> 00:20:52,349
Prepared for what?

213
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,916
It's my business.

214
00:20:53,917 --> 00:20:55,619
What kind of business is that?

215
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,989
None of yours.

216
00:20:57,989 --> 00:20:59,122
I don't pay

217
00:20:59,123 --> 00:21:00,825
for the best k-and-r
for nothing.

218
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:02,659
What's k-and-r?

219
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,996
It's kidnap
and ransom insurance.

220
00:21:05,997 --> 00:21:10,166
Look, I have an rfid chip
in my shoulder,

221
00:21:10,167 --> 00:21:13,436
and right now, securecorps'
armed response team

222
00:21:13,437 --> 00:21:15,871
is knocking
on tiburon's front door.

223
00:21:15,872 --> 00:21:17,442
- Hey, buddy.
- It's holt.

224
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,978
You're bleeding
from your shoulder.

225
00:21:20,978 --> 00:21:22,312
Hold still.

226
00:21:22,313 --> 00:21:25,548
I don't see any sort
of object in there.

227
00:21:25,549 --> 00:21:27,850
I'm betting your rfid
chip is on a plane

228
00:21:27,851 --> 00:21:29,218
halfway to Seattle by now.

229
00:21:29,219 --> 00:21:30,318
What do you know?

230
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:31,386
They'll find me.

231
00:21:31,387 --> 00:21:33,124
That's what I pay them for.

232
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,858
Why do you have
kidnapping insurance?

233
00:21:35,859 --> 00:21:37,494
Why do you ask
so many damn questions?

234
00:21:37,495 --> 00:21:39,363
It's my job.

235
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:41,164
That's where I know you from.

236
00:21:41,165 --> 00:21:43,200
You're on that TV show,

237
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:44,237
<i>hit 'em hard,</i> right?

238
00:21:46,237 --> 00:21:50,172
Pete, would you mind
taking a look at my leg?

239
00:21:50,173 --> 00:21:51,239
Yeah, of course.

240
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,548
Let's go sit over there.

241
00:21:59,317 --> 00:22:01,551
I'm Francine, by the way.

242
00:22:02,819 --> 00:22:04,089
Sorry, Francine.

243
00:22:06,089 --> 00:22:08,431
Holt, you've got a bite
on your leg, too.

244
00:22:13,431 --> 00:22:14,531
So where do we go now?

245
00:22:14,532 --> 00:22:16,232
We can't go backwards,

246
00:22:16,233 --> 00:22:18,868
so we start going forwards.

247
00:22:18,869 --> 00:22:21,237
All right. Well, everyone
hold on to their shackles.

248
00:22:21,238 --> 00:22:23,372
We could use every
resource that we have.

249
00:22:23,373 --> 00:22:24,907
Look, we need to start
thinking ahead

250
00:22:24,908 --> 00:22:26,776
if we're gonna survive
this sick game.

251
00:22:26,777 --> 00:22:29,747
You are way too calm
and know way too much.

252
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:30,717
Who are you?

253
00:22:32,717 --> 00:22:36,052
Ancient Hawaiians
used to drown sharks.

254
00:22:36,053 --> 00:22:38,622
How do you drown a fish?

255
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:40,623
Well, sharks breathe
by moving forward

256
00:22:40,624 --> 00:22:43,558
to push water through their
mouths and over their gills,

257
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:47,131
so if you can stop it from
moving, you can drown it.

258
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:49,399
Yeah.
Yeah, that's right.

259
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,403
Or we could pull it backwards.
That'll work, too.

260
00:22:53,404 --> 00:22:54,536
All right, everyone,

261
00:22:54,537 --> 00:22:55,297
grab your shackles.

262
00:23:00,111 --> 00:23:01,830
You, too.

263
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:55,934
Where are we going?

264
00:23:57,934 --> 00:24:01,476
Inland. Let's find
somewhere to rest.

265
00:24:05,476 --> 00:24:07,276
Let's find a place to hide.

266
00:24:07,277 --> 00:24:09,678
He can't kill us
if he can't find us.

267
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,881
Tiburon's got
cameras everywhere

268
00:24:11,882 --> 00:24:15,116
and booby traps to make sure
we don't stay in one place.

269
00:24:15,117 --> 00:24:17,052
Frankie's right.
The only way out

270
00:24:17,053 --> 00:24:19,287
is to follow the path.
If we don't,

271
00:24:19,288 --> 00:24:21,863
tiburon will find a way
to kill us for sure.

272
00:24:58,863 --> 00:24:59,732
What is it?

273
00:25:02,732 --> 00:25:04,401
Yeah.

274
00:25:04,402 --> 00:25:06,335
Locked.

275
00:25:06,336 --> 00:25:08,238
Should have known.

276
00:25:08,239 --> 00:25:09,909
Hey, Cal, where's that key?

277
00:25:11,909 --> 00:25:13,510
Ah, shoot.
Combination locks.

278
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:15,045
Should have known.

279
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:16,013
Let me see that.

280
00:25:17,013 --> 00:25:18,713
Maybe we can pry it open.

281
00:25:18,714 --> 00:25:20,217
No, don't. You'll break the key.

282
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:22,218
Yeah, Cal's right, sweetie.

283
00:25:22,219 --> 00:25:24,588
We don't know if we're
gonna need this again.

284
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:26,623
Yeah, like right now.

285
00:25:26,624 --> 00:25:27,923
What is it?

286
00:25:27,924 --> 00:25:28,924
Try this.

287
00:25:28,925 --> 00:25:32,230
5-4-1-2-6-0.

288
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:35,765
Good eye, Francine.

289
00:25:35,766 --> 00:25:37,133
Yeah.

290
00:25:37,134 --> 00:25:38,071
Ohh.

291
00:25:41,071 --> 00:25:43,210
First-aid kit,
ladies?

292
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:47,017
Friend.

293
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:28,518
Swarming around
the food like pups.

294
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:32,489
Well, you're about
to meet the mama.

295
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,624
I can't go back in the water.

296
00:26:34,625 --> 00:26:36,192
I'm just gonna
sit here and die.

297
00:26:36,193 --> 00:26:38,795
Layla, you-- you've
gotta calm down.

298
00:26:38,796 --> 00:26:41,664
Look, securecorps
knows I'm missing.

299
00:26:41,665 --> 00:26:43,000
I don't care
where that chip is.

300
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,138
If it's not at my desk
at the federal building...

301
00:26:48,138 --> 00:26:51,141
It will trigger a search.

302
00:26:51,142 --> 00:26:53,308
The federal building, huh?

303
00:26:53,309 --> 00:26:54,779
I work at the federal building.

304
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,812
I'm a judge.

305
00:26:55,813 --> 00:26:57,182
I'm a federal prosecutor.

306
00:26:59,182 --> 00:27:00,816
I'd say we acquire

307
00:27:00,817 --> 00:27:02,450
some pretty dangerous enemies.

308
00:27:02,451 --> 00:27:04,521
You guys busted him,
didn't you?

309
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:07,160
No. Busted his son,
junior.

310
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,393
That's right.

311
00:27:11,394 --> 00:27:13,396
He was killed in bedel canyon.

312
00:27:13,397 --> 00:27:15,198
I was there.

313
00:27:15,199 --> 00:27:17,967
This is starting to make sense.

314
00:27:17,968 --> 00:27:19,134
What did you do?

315
00:27:19,135 --> 00:27:20,837
I was one of
the undercover cops.

316
00:27:20,838 --> 00:27:22,739
Did you shoot him?

317
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,210
Lot of people shot him.

318
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:27,210
No.

319
00:27:27,211 --> 00:27:28,510
Pete, what's wrong?

320
00:27:28,511 --> 00:27:29,713
It's--it's his son.

321
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:31,213
I treated him.

322
00:27:31,214 --> 00:27:32,547
Well, at least I tried to,

323
00:27:32,548 --> 00:27:34,384
but he was already
dead when I got there.

324
00:27:34,385 --> 00:27:37,890
There wasn't anything
that I could do for him.

325
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:42,758
I signed the warrant.

326
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:45,327
I put the case together.

327
00:27:45,328 --> 00:27:47,197
We outsmarted his son.

328
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:49,031
We can outsmart him.

329
00:27:49,032 --> 00:27:51,034
If we don't play along,

330
00:27:51,035 --> 00:27:52,868
he'll kill us for sure.

331
00:27:52,869 --> 00:27:56,339
If we do, we might find a way
to beat him at his own game.

332
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,241
Okay. Let's keep
moving, then.

333
00:27:59,242 --> 00:28:02,346
The quicker we move, the
sooner this game will be over.

334
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:05,582
I thought I saw a trail
head back this way.

335
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:07,049
Come on, Layla.

336
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:09,285
Who put you in charge, huh?

337
00:28:09,286 --> 00:28:11,458
Picking fights isn't
going to solve anything.

338
00:28:14,458 --> 00:28:16,792
You save that psychobabble
for somebody else.

339
00:28:16,793 --> 00:28:18,796
I don't care about
your feelings.

340
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:21,064
I just need you to shut up

341
00:28:21,065 --> 00:28:22,777
and let me figure this out.

342
00:28:32,777 --> 00:28:36,498
It's not just the sharks that
are gonna get us killed.

343
00:28:54,498 --> 00:28:56,133
Shark's blood.

344
00:29:00,703 --> 00:29:03,506
To hunger

345
00:29:03,507 --> 00:29:05,285
and vengeance.

346
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:15,818
Come on, baby.

347
00:29:15,819 --> 00:29:18,523
You're having all the fun.
Can't I just watch?

348
00:29:24,494 --> 00:29:26,365
It's time to chum the water.

349
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:08,738
Ah, man.

350
00:30:08,739 --> 00:30:11,672
If we stay out of the water,
we'll be fine, right?

351
00:30:11,673 --> 00:30:13,443
I mean, no water,
no sharks, right?

352
00:30:13,444 --> 00:30:16,278
It can't be that easy.
All right?

353
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:18,247
Tiburon's crazy,
but he's not stupid.

354
00:30:18,248 --> 00:30:20,217
If he wants us in the water,

355
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:22,864
we're going in the water.

356
00:30:34,964 --> 00:30:36,310
What the hell?!

357
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:48,614
Everybody get back to back!

358
00:30:50,614 --> 00:30:52,452
Keep your eyes open.

359
00:31:05,429 --> 00:31:07,897
The door you see is your exit.

360
00:31:09,465 --> 00:31:11,636
The locked door, that is.

361
00:31:13,636 --> 00:31:18,114
Question is,
"where is the key?"

362
00:31:24,114 --> 00:31:26,282
There's--
there's no keyhole...

363
00:31:26,283 --> 00:31:28,019
No lock.

364
00:31:29,019 --> 00:31:31,754
There's--
there's nothing.

365
00:31:31,755 --> 00:31:34,659
Can any of you tell me why...

366
00:31:35,659 --> 00:31:38,694
The majority of shark attacks

367
00:31:38,695 --> 00:31:42,133
take place
in three feet of water?

368
00:31:43,133 --> 00:31:45,634
Shh.
Don't answer him.

369
00:31:45,635 --> 00:31:47,134
We may have to play along,

370
00:31:47,135 --> 00:31:49,105
but we do not have
to entertain him.

371
00:31:49,106 --> 00:31:54,311
Okay. We're all
intelligent people.

372
00:31:55,311 --> 00:31:56,881
But I'll tell you.

373
00:31:57,881 --> 00:31:59,949
The majority of shark attacks

374
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:03,118
take place
in three feet of water

375
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:05,022
because that is
where the food is.

376
00:32:06,022 --> 00:32:09,993
The exact amount of water
you are standing in.

377
00:32:18,568 --> 00:32:20,201
Everyone give me your shackles.

378
00:32:20,202 --> 00:32:21,236
We're gonna connect 'em.

379
00:32:21,237 --> 00:32:22,880
We're gonna make a noose.

380
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,750
Oh.

381
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,417
You're gonna drown a shark?

382
00:32:34,418 --> 00:32:35,418
We are.

383
00:32:35,419 --> 00:32:37,854
Francine, ragan,

384
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:38,824
scan the water.

385
00:32:40,824 --> 00:32:43,492
Holt, you and I
are gonna loop this

386
00:32:43,493 --> 00:32:44,992
around the shark's tail.

387
00:32:44,993 --> 00:32:47,397
Pete and I'll grab the
end and pull it back.

388
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:49,097
What should I do?

389
00:32:49,098 --> 00:32:52,171
Be quiet.
Don't die.

390
00:32:54,171 --> 00:32:56,071
Keep your eyes on the water,

391
00:32:56,072 --> 00:32:57,674
any ripple, any movement.

392
00:33:03,346 --> 00:33:05,547
Hammerheads...

393
00:33:05,548 --> 00:33:09,218
Are bottom swimmers,

394
00:33:09,219 --> 00:33:11,888
and because of the
placement of their eyes,

395
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:14,056
they are always looking up.

396
00:33:14,057 --> 00:33:17,093
That's why you never
know where they are

397
00:33:17,094 --> 00:33:18,429
till it's too late.

398
00:34:02,439 --> 00:34:04,289
Any second now.

399
00:34:20,289 --> 00:34:21,356
- Pete!
- Pete!

400
00:34:21,357 --> 00:34:23,494
- Oh, my God!
- The hell with this!

401
00:34:23,495 --> 00:34:24,493
Pete, hang on!

402
00:34:24,494 --> 00:34:26,463
Get the tail!

403
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:28,635
Oh, my God!

404
00:34:32,635 --> 00:34:34,337
- Pete!
- Pete!

405
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:36,875
It got him!

406
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:39,475
Get him!

407
00:34:39,476 --> 00:34:41,550
- Pete!
- Hell with this!

408
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:48,987
Pete!

409
00:34:50,987 --> 00:34:52,226
Pete, hang on, man!

410
00:34:56,226 --> 00:34:58,494
I'm gonna tie the noose
around the shark's tail.

411
00:34:58,495 --> 00:34:59,694
Yeah! Come on!

412
00:34:59,695 --> 00:35:01,400
- Be careful, Cal!
- Oh, my God!

413
00:35:08,905 --> 00:35:10,304
Help me move
the shark backwards.

414
00:35:10,305 --> 00:35:11,307
- Pull! Pull!
- Pull!

415
00:35:14,577 --> 00:35:17,145
- I got it.
- Is he dead?

416
00:35:17,146 --> 00:35:19,724
Pull it!

417
00:35:28,724 --> 00:35:30,527
- Aah!
- Pull! Pull!

418
00:35:36,432 --> 00:35:37,601
- Get it off me!
- No! He's dying!

419
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:39,943
- Pull!
- Pull!

420
00:35:46,943 --> 00:35:49,947
The shark is slowing down.
I think it's drowning.

421
00:35:49,948 --> 00:35:52,686
- Pull it!
- Pull it!

422
00:35:56,686 --> 00:35:58,621
Oh, my God.
Is it dead?

423
00:36:07,864 --> 00:36:10,098
Oh, my God.

424
00:36:10,099 --> 00:36:11,539
Oh, my God.

425
00:36:15,539 --> 00:36:16,786
Hmph.

426
00:36:30,786 --> 00:36:33,055
He was innocent!

427
00:36:33,056 --> 00:36:35,156
He didn't kill your son!

428
00:36:35,157 --> 00:36:37,959
He tried to save him!

429
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:43,568
Are you defending yourself
or him, detective?

430
00:36:44,568 --> 00:36:45,968
Doesn't matter.

431
00:36:45,969 --> 00:36:48,172
You'll get your turn.

432
00:36:50,172 --> 00:36:51,994
You all will.

433
00:37:10,994 --> 00:37:12,092
- All right.
- All right.

434
00:37:12,093 --> 00:37:13,994
Can we get out of here now?

435
00:37:13,995 --> 00:37:15,264
Let's get out of here.

436
00:37:15,265 --> 00:37:16,338
Yeah, let's go.

437
00:37:22,338 --> 00:37:23,253
Oh, God.

438
00:37:36,253 --> 00:37:38,321
We need more food and water.

439
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:40,347
There's got to be another
container somewhere.

440
00:38:04,347 --> 00:38:06,348
Amazing.

441
00:38:06,349 --> 00:38:09,584
It's not just the
sharks that can learn.

442
00:38:09,585 --> 00:38:11,724
Hope they don't learn too fast.

443
00:38:13,724 --> 00:38:17,359
That was even more
exciting than I expected.

444
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,927
Heh.

445
00:38:51,927 --> 00:38:54,327
I'm gonna see if I can find
something to crack 'em open with.

446
00:39:02,072 --> 00:39:06,808
Do we trust him to go
on a search alone?

447
00:39:06,809 --> 00:39:09,678
Yeah, what if he's
helping tiburon?

448
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:11,479
You know, it seems
like he knows more

449
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,851
about why we're here
than we do.

450
00:39:14,851 --> 00:39:16,517
- What's the difference?
- You can go with him

451
00:39:16,518 --> 00:39:17,987
if you'd like,
but I'm fine right here.

452
00:39:17,988 --> 00:39:20,955
Yeah. Me, too.

453
00:39:20,956 --> 00:39:24,192
Yeah, me, too.

454
00:39:24,193 --> 00:39:25,864
I'm fine here, too.

455
00:39:27,864 --> 00:39:30,030
Look, now we know
what to expect.

456
00:39:30,031 --> 00:39:32,833
We just have to outsmart the
shark before it gets one of us.

457
00:39:32,834 --> 00:39:34,545
Hah! Easier
said than done.

458
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:43,480
We have to strike
before the shark does.

459
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:45,644
That's just stupid.

460
00:40:15,644 --> 00:40:18,715
Where the hell
did you find a knife?

461
00:40:19,715 --> 00:40:20,782
You working with them?

462
00:40:20,783 --> 00:40:21,283
What? No.

463
00:40:23,085 --> 00:40:24,985
I don't work
for tiburon anymore.

464
00:40:24,986 --> 00:40:26,854
I'm just as screwed
as the rest of you all.

465
00:40:26,855 --> 00:40:28,755
I found this knife sticking
out of a tree back there.

466
00:40:28,756 --> 00:40:30,325
You know him?
Get us out of here.

467
00:40:30,326 --> 00:40:32,559
Look, if I can't
get out, nobody can.

468
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,280
Give me the knife.

469
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:37,065
What did you have to do
with his son's death?

470
00:40:37,066 --> 00:40:39,900
Look, lady, I don't
have to tell you anything.

471
00:40:39,901 --> 00:40:41,744
And you're not
getting the knife.

472
00:40:47,744 --> 00:40:50,278
Okay, listen. I know
we're all scared here,

473
00:40:50,279 --> 00:40:52,546
but we're gonna have
to work as a team.

474
00:40:52,547 --> 00:40:54,548
We have a weapon now.
We can fight back.

475
00:40:54,549 --> 00:40:56,751
Hey, there's seven of
us and just one of him.

476
00:40:56,752 --> 00:40:59,521
Wouldn't it be easier to fight
tiburon than the sharks?

477
00:40:59,522 --> 00:41:01,523
What? Do you really think
you could fight him?

478
00:41:01,524 --> 00:41:04,092
Do you really think it's just
tiburon and Elena on this island?

479
00:41:04,093 --> 00:41:06,427
Tiburon has an entire
army at his disposal.

480
00:41:06,428 --> 00:41:08,795
Then why don't you tell us
what you're doing here?

481
00:41:08,796 --> 00:41:09,930
What are you hiding?

482
00:41:09,931 --> 00:41:11,099
What'd you do to his son?

483
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,367
Nothing! I loved the kid

484
00:41:12,368 --> 00:41:13,888
like a brother.
I would never hurt him!

485
00:41:16,739 --> 00:41:18,607
All right.

486
00:41:18,608 --> 00:41:19,943
Whatever you say, man.

487
00:41:19,944 --> 00:41:23,312
Frankie, you need to chill out.

488
00:41:23,313 --> 00:41:26,113
Would you at least be
willing to use your knife

489
00:41:26,114 --> 00:41:28,650
to cut down some
of those sticks over there?

490
00:41:28,651 --> 00:41:29,816
We could sharpen 'em.

491
00:41:29,817 --> 00:41:31,554
At least we'd all
have a weapon.

492
00:41:31,555 --> 00:41:34,579
Yeah. I can do that.

493
00:41:56,579 --> 00:41:59,181
Good luck piercing
the thick skin of a shark

494
00:41:59,182 --> 00:42:00,848
with pointy sticks.

495
00:42:00,849 --> 00:42:04,590
We have one knife and a bunch
of sticks against a shark.

496
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:08,256
We're dead, all of us.

497
00:42:08,257 --> 00:42:09,925
You can't talk like that.

498
00:42:09,926 --> 00:42:11,627
We killed one shark.

499
00:42:11,628 --> 00:42:13,195
We can kill another one,

500
00:42:13,196 --> 00:42:16,098
especially now that
we're more prepared.

501
00:42:16,099 --> 00:42:18,335
The hammerhead isn't even
the toughest of the sharks.

502
00:42:18,336 --> 00:42:22,471
What if we would have come
up against something worse?

503
00:42:22,472 --> 00:42:24,708
We can't kill all of them.

504
00:42:25,708 --> 00:42:26,619
We're already dead.

505
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:37,118
Take it then.

506
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:38,620
What?

507
00:42:38,621 --> 00:42:40,391
Use it to cut your wrists.

508
00:42:42,391 --> 00:42:43,490
Why would I do that?

509
00:42:43,491 --> 00:42:44,691
'Cause, man, you keep

510
00:42:44,692 --> 00:42:46,193
talking about it,
you're gonna be

511
00:42:46,194 --> 00:42:48,503
nothing but a burden
on the rest of us.

512
00:42:54,503 --> 00:42:56,538
I get what you're doing,

513
00:42:56,539 --> 00:42:59,174
but, no, thanks.

514
00:42:59,175 --> 00:43:00,547
Take your knife.

515
00:43:05,547 --> 00:43:06,750
So what's our plan?

516
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:07,915
I guess we start

517
00:43:07,916 --> 00:43:09,156
with what we know about sharks.

518
00:43:11,154 --> 00:43:13,054
They can hear your heartbeat.

519
00:43:13,055 --> 00:43:14,495
And they have
heightened perceptions.

520
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:19,060
Blood, movement,

521
00:43:19,061 --> 00:43:20,728
they're attracted
to those things.

522
00:43:20,729 --> 00:43:22,429
You know, I just
thought of something.

523
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:24,865
I must have seen it on TV, a
nature channel or something,

524
00:43:24,866 --> 00:43:26,003
but there was this guy.

525
00:43:27,003 --> 00:43:29,071
He was swimming with sharks,

526
00:43:29,072 --> 00:43:33,408
and he would touch them in
this spot on the receptors.

527
00:43:33,409 --> 00:43:36,177
He would just pet them
a couple of times,

528
00:43:36,178 --> 00:43:38,945
a-and then they would
go into this trance.

529
00:43:38,946 --> 00:43:42,684
They would roll belly-up and
be out cold for a few minutes.

530
00:43:42,685 --> 00:43:44,686
You want to hypnotize a shark?

531
00:43:44,687 --> 00:43:46,556
That's your big plan, Francine?

532
00:43:46,557 --> 00:43:50,892
No, what I'm saying is if
touching them in that spot

533
00:43:50,893 --> 00:43:53,294
puts them into a sleep,

534
00:43:53,295 --> 00:43:56,268
maybe stabbing them would be a
pretty damn good way to kill them.

535
00:43:59,268 --> 00:44:01,136
But it's gotta be a punch.

536
00:44:01,137 --> 00:44:02,403
It's gotta be hard,

537
00:44:02,404 --> 00:44:04,706
because the shark's skin
is so thick,

538
00:44:04,707 --> 00:44:06,244
and we have just sticks.

539
00:44:09,244 --> 00:44:10,981
Maybe the eye.

540
00:44:11,981 --> 00:44:13,414
Yeah, the eyes are good,

541
00:44:13,415 --> 00:44:15,583
but it's only fatal
if you get to the brain.

542
00:44:15,584 --> 00:44:16,920
There's a better route to that.

543
00:44:16,921 --> 00:44:18,621
Just right over the top.

544
00:44:19,621 --> 00:44:21,155
That doesn't make any sense.

545
00:44:21,156 --> 00:44:22,757
If you're close
enough to stab it,

546
00:44:22,758 --> 00:44:23,990
you're close enough
to get bitten.

547
00:44:23,991 --> 00:44:25,992
You know what?
I'm not doing it.

548
00:44:25,993 --> 00:44:28,998
Look, if you're not going to help
us plan, then keep your mouth shut.

549
00:44:29,998 --> 00:44:31,766
This is a conversation
we need to have,

550
00:44:31,767 --> 00:44:34,003
but we don't need to have
it right this second.

551
00:44:35,003 --> 00:44:37,608
It's been a hell of a day.

552
00:44:38,608 --> 00:44:40,174
But, uh, in the end,

553
00:44:40,175 --> 00:44:41,335
it comes down to that moment,

554
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:44,580
and for that,
you need a clear head

555
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:47,348
and all the strength
you can muster.

556
00:44:47,349 --> 00:44:49,251
If we want to get through this,

557
00:44:49,252 --> 00:44:51,285
if we want to live,

558
00:44:51,286 --> 00:44:52,821
we have to be focused.

559
00:44:52,822 --> 00:44:54,355
Cal's right.

560
00:44:54,356 --> 00:44:56,116
We keep walking in
circles, we'll be useless.

561
00:45:08,438 --> 00:45:10,476
I have a plan.

562
00:45:13,476 --> 00:45:15,476
Maybe we can
distract the shark.

563
00:45:15,477 --> 00:45:17,016
How do you distract a shark?

564
00:45:20,016 --> 00:45:23,722
With a heartbeat and blood.

565
00:45:25,722 --> 00:45:27,955
What are you saying?

566
00:45:27,956 --> 00:45:30,525
I'm a bad person.
I'm not like all of you.

567
00:45:30,526 --> 00:45:31,664
I deserve to be here.

568
00:45:35,664 --> 00:45:39,068
I deserve to die. Feed me to the
shark while you guys escape.

569
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:41,809
That's not true.
No one deserves this.

570
00:45:46,809 --> 00:45:47,411
But it'll work.

571
00:45:49,411 --> 00:45:50,411
We won't let you do that.

572
00:45:51,014 --> 00:45:52,313
We're gonna stick together,

573
00:45:52,314 --> 00:45:54,724
and we're gonna get out
of this alive.

574
00:46:01,724 --> 00:46:03,599
Mind if I borrow that
knife for a second?

575
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:11,500
Thanks.

576
00:46:11,501 --> 00:46:13,702
Hey, where you going
with the knife?

577
00:46:13,703 --> 00:46:16,404
I'm going to get
some shark's teeth.

578
00:46:16,405 --> 00:46:18,073
You need a hand?

579
00:46:18,074 --> 00:46:19,465
Nope. I got it.

580
00:46:43,465 --> 00:46:44,302
Sorry.

581
00:47:10,659 --> 00:47:14,373
What does he think he's gonna be
able to do with shark's teeth?

582
00:47:23,373 --> 00:47:25,340
They're sharp.
That's a weapon.

583
00:47:25,341 --> 00:47:27,341
Are you serious?

584
00:47:27,342 --> 00:47:28,944
As a heart attack.

585
00:47:28,945 --> 00:47:30,114
You want one?

586
00:47:32,114 --> 00:47:35,683
No, but I'll take
my knife back.

587
00:47:35,684 --> 00:47:36,404
Yeah, give me one.

588
00:47:37,019 --> 00:47:38,687
What the hell, right?

589
00:47:38,688 --> 00:47:41,122
Fine. Who else
wants one?

590
00:47:41,123 --> 00:47:42,726
Take it.

591
00:47:44,726 --> 00:47:46,529
Maybe we can tie
the shark tooth

592
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:48,652
to the stick and make a spear.

593
00:48:09,652 --> 00:48:11,986
I can't sleep.

594
00:48:11,987 --> 00:48:15,156
Just try, sweetie.
Close your eyes.

595
00:48:15,157 --> 00:48:17,027
Can't sleep either?

596
00:48:18,027 --> 00:48:21,363
No. Can't get my mind
to be quiet.

597
00:48:21,364 --> 00:48:24,098
Too many questions
without any answers.

598
00:48:24,099 --> 00:48:25,706
Yeah. Know what you mean.

599
00:48:29,706 --> 00:48:31,108
What about the others?

600
00:48:33,108 --> 00:48:35,877
Well, I think it's pretty hard

601
00:48:35,878 --> 00:48:38,512
to sleep out here
with the sun blazing,

602
00:48:38,513 --> 00:48:40,615
but everyone's giving it a try.

603
00:48:40,616 --> 00:48:42,786
They seem peaceful, huh?

604
00:48:43,786 --> 00:48:45,025
All things considered.

605
00:48:49,025 --> 00:48:52,260
I'm just trying not to
lose my mind, honestly.

606
00:48:52,261 --> 00:48:53,963
Whatever's left of it.

607
00:49:38,007 --> 00:49:39,640
There you are.

608
00:49:39,641 --> 00:49:41,327
Been looking all over for you.

609
00:49:59,327 --> 00:50:00,264
Thanks.

610
00:50:02,264 --> 00:50:03,108
You're welcome.

611
00:50:13,108 --> 00:50:15,209
Good morning.

612
00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:16,778
Time to get up.

613
00:50:16,779 --> 00:50:20,649
We have so many
fun activities planned.

614
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:24,710
Follow the marked path
down the hill into the caves.

615
00:51:09,498 --> 00:51:10,034
Thirsty.

616
00:51:13,034 --> 00:51:14,237
We should have
brought coconuts.

617
00:51:14,238 --> 00:51:15,937
We'll find some more.

618
00:51:15,938 --> 00:51:18,072
We have been drugged
and kidnapped by a maniac

619
00:51:18,073 --> 00:51:19,940
making us fight
a different shark every day.

620
00:51:19,941 --> 00:51:21,341
You'd be lucky
if you die of thirst.

621
00:51:23,179 --> 00:51:25,014
So what do you think
it'll be this time?

622
00:51:26,014 --> 00:51:27,583
The trap, or the shark?

623
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:29,451
Oh, God.

624
00:51:29,452 --> 00:51:32,453
I meant the trap,
but now I mean both.

625
00:51:32,454 --> 00:51:33,787
There's no way of knowing,

626
00:51:33,788 --> 00:51:36,224
and nothing we could do
even if we did.

627
00:51:36,225 --> 00:51:38,727
Just keep your eyes open.

628
00:51:38,728 --> 00:51:42,397
Tiburon could spring it
on us at any moment.

629
00:51:42,398 --> 00:51:45,802
As long as Frankie's got
that knife, we got a chance.

630
00:51:47,802 --> 00:51:49,137
Let's keep moving.

631
00:52:21,137 --> 00:52:22,273
There it is.

632
00:52:24,273 --> 00:52:27,244
Jesus. Look at
the size of that thing.

633
00:52:29,244 --> 00:52:31,684
Looks like round two.

634
00:52:35,684 --> 00:52:37,151
This is not good.

635
00:52:37,152 --> 00:52:38,520
Stay calm.

636
00:52:38,521 --> 00:52:40,653
- How the hell am I supposed to do that?
- Try!

637
00:52:40,654 --> 00:52:42,822
Listen, guys, we've got our
Spears to fight this thing.

638
00:52:42,823 --> 00:52:43,703
What else have we got?

639
00:52:46,094 --> 00:52:49,263
I got a knife.
I got the wire.

640
00:52:49,264 --> 00:52:50,832
Okay.

641
00:52:50,833 --> 00:52:52,204
Frankie, knife.

642
00:52:55,204 --> 00:52:58,439
What are you doing?

643
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:00,516
Something stupid.

644
00:53:07,516 --> 00:53:09,683
What the hell?

645
00:53:09,684 --> 00:53:10,824
I'm with stupid.

646
00:53:49,824 --> 00:53:51,427
Oh, hell.

647
00:53:52,427 --> 00:53:53,762
- What are you guys doing?
- No! Stop!

648
00:53:53,763 --> 00:53:54,763
Don't do it!

649
00:53:54,764 --> 00:53:56,704
Hang on, cowboy.

650
00:54:01,704 --> 00:54:03,543
- Did it work? Come on, holt.
- Nothing.

651
00:54:18,054 --> 00:54:19,952
It's not working.
Come on, Layla.

652
00:54:19,953 --> 00:54:20,593
Throw something.

653
00:54:34,436 --> 00:54:36,646
Francine!

654
00:54:55,990 --> 00:54:58,398
Oh, my God!

655
00:55:02,398 --> 00:55:03,969
What the hell?

656
00:55:06,969 --> 00:55:09,904
Am I too late?

657
00:55:09,905 --> 00:55:12,914
Oh, you're never
too late, darling.

658
00:55:20,949 --> 00:55:22,030
Where is it?
Where are they?

659
00:55:27,188 --> 00:55:28,302
Cal!

660
00:55:41,302 --> 00:55:42,154
Francine?

661
00:55:58,154 --> 00:55:59,666
Come on.
She's gone.

662
00:57:17,666 --> 00:57:18,802
What's happening?

663
00:57:20,802 --> 00:57:22,032
A new day.

664
00:57:51,032 --> 00:57:53,701
Let's see if we
can find some food,

665
00:57:53,702 --> 00:57:56,449
whatever else
tiburon has left for us.

666
00:58:08,449 --> 00:58:10,789
Hey, guys, it's a boat!

667
00:58:13,789 --> 00:58:14,888
It's a boat.

668
00:58:14,889 --> 00:58:16,490
Told you they were
coming for me.

669
00:58:16,491 --> 00:58:18,992
Do you really think tiburon
is gonna leave us a boat?

670
00:58:18,993 --> 00:58:20,273
Only if he left us
a shark in it.

671
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:22,662
Let's check it. Maybe
there's a cellphone

672
00:58:22,663 --> 00:58:23,896
or a flare gun or something.

673
00:58:23,897 --> 00:58:25,331
And we'll push it in the water.

674
00:58:25,332 --> 00:58:26,612
We can get off
this island, guys.

675
00:58:30,405 --> 00:58:31,672
See anything?

676
00:58:31,673 --> 00:58:35,210
It's full of holes.

677
00:58:36,978 --> 00:58:39,881
Never gonna get off this island.

678
00:58:39,882 --> 00:58:41,549
We need to keep moving.

679
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:43,849
Even if we could get
this thing in the water,

680
00:58:43,850 --> 00:58:45,559
this thing's not gonna float.

681
00:59:04,273 --> 00:59:05,939
We can't go that way.

682
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:07,301
Then we'd just be
going in circles.

683
00:59:11,012 --> 00:59:12,846
Stop!

684
00:59:12,847 --> 00:59:13,915
Uh-oh.

685
00:59:13,916 --> 00:59:15,249
It's a mine.

686
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:17,384
There is no way

687
00:59:17,385 --> 00:59:19,625
we're going through
that minefield.

688
00:59:22,625 --> 00:59:24,792
It's okay.

689
00:59:24,793 --> 00:59:26,128
We're gonna make it.

690
00:59:26,129 --> 00:59:27,127
It's not okay.

691
00:59:27,128 --> 00:59:28,962
None of this is okay.

692
00:59:28,963 --> 00:59:31,231
If I go, I'm dead, and
if I stay, I'm dead.

693
00:59:31,232 --> 00:59:33,733
You don't want to go, fine.
Then go back,

694
00:59:33,734 --> 00:59:36,403
and have one of tiburon's
men finish you off.

695
00:59:36,404 --> 00:59:37,903
Well, then you go first, then.

696
00:59:37,904 --> 00:59:39,942
- Fine. Maybe I will go first.
- Calm down.

697
00:59:39,943 --> 00:59:42,576
This doesn't help
our situation.

698
00:59:42,577 --> 00:59:43,911
It'd make me feel better
if you went first.

699
00:59:43,912 --> 00:59:44,882
Shut up!

700
00:59:47,882 --> 00:59:48,884
It's all right.

701
00:59:48,885 --> 00:59:52,886
Just follow me.

702
00:59:52,887 --> 00:59:53,626
Step lightly.

703
01:00:30,626 --> 01:00:31,702
Here.

704
01:00:41,769 --> 01:00:43,671
Uh-oh. Cal.

705
01:00:43,672 --> 01:00:45,806
Yeah?

706
01:00:45,807 --> 01:00:47,808
Can't move.

707
01:00:47,809 --> 01:00:49,810
What?

708
01:00:49,811 --> 01:00:51,678
I can't move my leg.

709
01:00:51,679 --> 01:00:53,690
The rest of you
keep moving slowly.

710
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:03,126
How you doing?

711
01:01:05,126 --> 01:01:06,392
Terrified. How do you
think I'm doing?

712
01:01:06,393 --> 01:01:07,661
What are we gonna do?

713
01:01:07,662 --> 01:01:09,695
Give me a few seconds
to think about it.

714
01:01:09,696 --> 01:01:10,699
How many you need?

715
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:12,567
- 3...
- Okay.

716
01:01:12,568 --> 01:01:14,635
- 2...
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

717
01:01:14,636 --> 01:01:16,537
No, Jesus.
Jesus Christ.

718
01:01:16,538 --> 01:01:18,295
Run!

719
01:02:14,295 --> 01:02:15,034
Hmm.

720
01:02:20,034 --> 01:02:21,569
I don't get it.

721
01:02:21,570 --> 01:02:23,206
This is all about his son.

722
01:02:25,206 --> 01:02:27,241
You were at bedel canyon.

723
01:02:27,242 --> 01:02:29,576
I don't know about you two.

724
01:02:29,577 --> 01:02:31,311
Yeah, when I was
researching the story,

725
01:02:31,312 --> 01:02:33,114
I didn't see
either of your names.

726
01:02:33,115 --> 01:02:37,619
I was supposed to be at
bedel canyon, not junior.

727
01:02:38,619 --> 01:02:39,922
Like I said earlier,

728
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:41,823
he was like family to me.

729
01:02:41,824 --> 01:02:44,458
I was out getting
shitfaced drunk that night,

730
01:02:44,459 --> 01:02:46,928
and junior covered me.

731
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:49,230
Well, that explains it.

732
01:02:49,231 --> 01:02:51,298
Junior was not supposed
to be there that night.

733
01:02:51,299 --> 01:02:52,666
Thought we caught
a lucky break.

734
01:02:52,667 --> 01:02:54,333
When he showed up
to make the buy,

735
01:02:54,334 --> 01:02:55,802
we couldn't believe it.

736
01:02:55,803 --> 01:02:57,970
And it all went to
hell, and he got shot.

737
01:02:57,971 --> 01:02:59,211
Wasn't supposed
to go like that.

738
01:03:01,076 --> 01:03:03,347
What about you?

739
01:03:05,347 --> 01:03:07,650
What can I say?
I'm a junkie.

740
01:03:09,650 --> 01:03:11,822
I went to go buy some
stuff one night.

741
01:03:13,822 --> 01:03:15,988
They asked me if I knew junior,

742
01:03:15,989 --> 01:03:18,760
and I told them what
they wanted to hear.

743
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:22,632
I just told them so I
can get out of there.

744
01:03:24,632 --> 01:03:26,601
Congratulations.
You've connected the dots.

745
01:03:26,602 --> 01:03:30,275
Now off to the next shark
that awaits you.

746
01:03:45,152 --> 01:03:47,054
That's the biggest fish
I've ever seen.

747
01:03:47,055 --> 01:03:49,991
It's not even
the tiger shark's size

748
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:54,395
that is its most
intimidating attribute.

749
01:03:54,396 --> 01:03:58,566
Tiger sharks,
more so than any others,

750
01:03:58,567 --> 01:04:00,635
truly have a taste for humans.

751
01:04:00,636 --> 01:04:01,968
They crave us.

752
01:04:01,969 --> 01:04:04,671
They will actually swim
in fresh water

753
01:04:04,672 --> 01:04:06,172
just to get us.

754
01:04:06,173 --> 01:04:09,579
If there was ever
an man-eater...

755
01:04:10,579 --> 01:04:12,048
It's the tiger shark.

756
01:04:14,048 --> 01:04:15,548
We can't go in
with that monster.

757
01:04:15,549 --> 01:04:17,318
We gotta find a way
around the side.

758
01:04:17,319 --> 01:04:18,518
Around the side?

759
01:04:18,519 --> 01:04:20,987
Where are we gonna
go around the side?

760
01:04:20,988 --> 01:04:22,228
Is it even worth
trying anymore?

761
01:04:26,161 --> 01:04:28,428
Look at this.

762
01:04:28,429 --> 01:04:29,233
I have an idea.

763
01:04:32,233 --> 01:04:35,005
I can't wait to see what it is.

764
01:04:37,005 --> 01:04:38,045
Cal, what you got planned?

765
01:04:39,007 --> 01:04:40,840
I need you guys
to link arms with me

766
01:04:40,841 --> 01:04:42,244
and hold me up over the water.

767
01:04:42,245 --> 01:04:44,210
Layla, hold this.

768
01:04:44,211 --> 01:04:45,253
Holt, come on.

769
01:04:52,253 --> 01:04:53,213
Cal, what are you doing?

770
01:04:54,021 --> 01:04:55,795
I'm gonna feed the fish.

771
01:04:59,795 --> 01:05:00,794
Almost.

772
01:05:00,795 --> 01:05:01,295
Got you.

773
01:05:03,264 --> 01:05:05,399
You're not gonna make it, Cal.

774
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:06,541
We need another person.

775
01:05:13,541 --> 01:05:14,875
Layla?

776
01:05:14,876 --> 01:05:17,621
I'm the smallest and lightest.

777
01:05:27,621 --> 01:05:29,223
Are you sure?

778
01:05:29,224 --> 01:05:30,663
No.

779
01:05:42,704 --> 01:05:45,038
They'll kill themselves

780
01:05:45,039 --> 01:05:47,708
before the sharks
get the chance.

781
01:05:49,110 --> 01:05:50,213
Maybe.

782
01:05:51,213 --> 01:05:52,139
Little more.

783
01:06:18,139 --> 01:06:20,140
Oh, my God!
Layla!

784
01:06:20,141 --> 01:06:21,577
- Layla!
- Layla!

785
01:06:22,577 --> 01:06:24,812
We gotta
help her. Layla!

786
01:06:24,813 --> 01:06:26,483
Layla! No!

787
01:06:28,483 --> 01:06:29,483
Layla, hold on!

788
01:06:29,484 --> 01:06:31,352
- Hold on!
- Help me!

789
01:06:31,353 --> 01:06:33,220
Help me!

790
01:06:33,221 --> 01:06:34,688
- Come on!
- Come on, swim!

791
01:06:34,689 --> 01:06:37,357
Come on!
You can do it!

792
01:06:37,358 --> 01:06:38,891
You can do it.
Swim to the exit.

793
01:06:38,892 --> 01:06:40,097
- Where'd it go?
- Come on!

794
01:06:43,097 --> 01:06:44,098
Help me!

795
01:06:44,099 --> 01:06:45,732
Come on, Layla.

796
01:06:45,733 --> 01:06:46,453
You could do this.

797
01:06:49,404 --> 01:06:50,738
- Go!
- Hang on!

798
01:06:50,739 --> 01:06:51,871
Yeah, come on.
Swim over

799
01:06:51,872 --> 01:06:52,673
to the exit.
Come on.

800
01:06:53,007 --> 01:06:54,741
You can make it!

801
01:06:54,742 --> 01:06:55,941
Come on!
You can do it!

802
01:06:55,942 --> 01:06:56,942
- You can make it.
- Swim!

803
01:06:58,213 --> 01:06:59,879
Come on.
Come on.

804
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:00,880
Come on, Layla!

805
01:07:00,881 --> 01:07:02,617
- Come on.
- Come on, Layla.

806
01:07:02,618 --> 01:07:03,186
Come on!

807
01:07:05,186 --> 01:07:06,187
Shit.

808
01:07:06,188 --> 01:07:07,420
Come on.
Don't give in.

809
01:07:07,421 --> 01:07:09,391
Come on.
Swim over to the exit.

810
01:07:09,392 --> 01:07:10,924
Come on. Come on.

811
01:07:10,925 --> 01:07:12,593
Don't give up.

812
01:07:12,594 --> 01:07:15,062
- Layla, hold on.
- Come on!

813
01:07:15,063 --> 01:07:16,766
Come on, Layla!

814
01:07:17,766 --> 01:07:18,765
Swim!

815
01:07:18,766 --> 01:07:20,266
Don't give up.
Come on.

816
01:07:20,267 --> 01:07:21,436
It's coming for you.

817
01:07:21,437 --> 01:07:23,806
- Hurry! Hurry!
- Go!

818
01:07:25,806 --> 01:07:27,443
Swim!

819
01:07:29,443 --> 01:07:31,212
Get out of there!

820
01:07:31,213 --> 01:07:32,580
Get out of there!

821
01:07:32,581 --> 01:07:33,786
No. Just go.

822
01:07:37,786 --> 01:07:39,252
You can make it.

823
01:07:39,253 --> 01:07:40,254
Come on.

824
01:07:40,255 --> 01:07:41,802
Go!

825
01:07:54,802 --> 01:07:56,904
Layla!

826
01:07:56,905 --> 01:07:58,311
Layla.

827
01:08:03,311 --> 01:08:05,645
You did good.

828
01:08:05,646 --> 01:08:07,193
We gotta keep moving.

829
01:08:18,193 --> 01:08:19,963
You're making it too easy.

830
01:08:22,963 --> 01:08:24,265
I thought the whole point

831
01:08:24,266 --> 01:08:27,201
was to let the sharks
just rip them apart.

832
01:08:27,202 --> 01:08:30,470
Everyone needs hope, Elena,

833
01:08:30,471 --> 01:08:32,842
my bloodthirsty Elena.

834
01:08:34,842 --> 01:08:37,409
Even if it is false.

835
01:09:08,409 --> 01:09:10,063
Hey, wait. I see
something, guys.

836
01:09:28,063 --> 01:09:29,363
Look, guys.
I got it.

837
01:09:29,364 --> 01:09:30,533
It's a harpoon.

838
01:09:32,533 --> 01:09:35,269
So this is our next trap.

839
01:09:35,270 --> 01:09:37,543
Think of it as our
next chance to escape.

840
01:09:42,543 --> 01:09:44,350
I'm too old to play pretend.

841
01:09:49,350 --> 01:09:50,717
You're almost
at the finish line.

842
01:09:50,718 --> 01:09:51,851
If you pass this challenge,

843
01:09:51,852 --> 01:09:53,385
you will be rewarded
with a boat.

844
01:09:53,386 --> 01:09:54,855
We really believe him?

845
01:09:54,856 --> 01:09:57,367
Do you want to wait
and find out?

846
01:10:05,367 --> 01:10:07,935
Listen, we've gotta assume
what he says is true.

847
01:10:07,936 --> 01:10:10,306
You know what we have to go do.

848
01:10:12,306 --> 01:10:14,877
Anyone want Sushi?

849
01:10:16,877 --> 01:10:19,612
Frankie, wait!

850
01:10:19,613 --> 01:10:20,949
Frankie!

851
01:10:21,949 --> 01:10:23,970
Come on, holt.

852
01:10:42,970 --> 01:10:46,607
Come on! Where are you,
you son of a bitch?!

853
01:10:46,608 --> 01:10:48,487
Oh, there it is, Cal!

854
01:10:59,487 --> 01:11:02,255
Come on, Cal!
Stab him!

855
01:11:02,256 --> 01:11:03,527
Cal!

856
01:11:05,527 --> 01:11:06,802
No!

857
01:11:14,802 --> 01:11:16,636
Aah! It got my leg!

858
01:11:16,637 --> 01:11:18,807
Frankie!

859
01:11:23,645 --> 01:11:25,114
Frankie, hold on!

860
01:11:27,114 --> 01:11:28,854
Frankie!

861
01:11:33,854 --> 01:11:34,354
No!

862
01:11:37,324 --> 01:11:38,176
Frankie.

863
01:11:56,176 --> 01:11:57,666
Ragan!

864
01:12:18,666 --> 01:12:20,267
Holt!

865
01:12:20,268 --> 01:12:21,108
Come on!

866
01:12:27,108 --> 01:12:28,108
You okay?

867
01:12:28,109 --> 01:12:29,681
Yeah.

868
01:12:34,681 --> 01:12:36,950
Well, you know what they say.

869
01:12:36,951 --> 01:12:38,354
You mess with the bull...

870
01:12:40,354 --> 01:12:42,903
You get the horns.

871
01:13:28,903 --> 01:13:29,464
You all right?

872
01:13:31,104 --> 01:13:32,144
Yeah.
It's like a vacation.

873
01:13:36,109 --> 01:13:38,612
I'm serious.

874
01:13:38,613 --> 01:13:40,585
How you holding up?

875
01:13:43,585 --> 01:13:45,658
I don't want to die.

876
01:13:50,658 --> 01:13:52,761
I'm not gonna let that happen.

877
01:13:54,761 --> 01:13:56,167
How can you say that?

878
01:13:59,167 --> 01:14:00,836
Promise.

879
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:48,314
And now...

880
01:14:48,315 --> 01:14:52,480
We come to the final act.

881
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:55,817
You know, if it
wasn't so terrifying,

882
01:15:55,818 --> 01:15:57,188
it'd be beautiful.

883
01:16:00,188 --> 01:16:03,523
Well, the real beauty
is waiting in the water.

884
01:16:03,524 --> 01:16:07,875
As always, the best
must be saved for last.

885
01:16:20,875 --> 01:16:22,877
It's gonna be all right.

886
01:16:23,877 --> 01:16:24,681
How?

887
01:16:27,681 --> 01:16:30,353
The great white shark.

888
01:16:32,353 --> 01:16:35,159
The fiercest, strongest...

889
01:16:39,159 --> 01:16:44,259
And the apex predator
on the planet.

890
01:17:11,259 --> 01:17:14,394
You really can't give up,
can you, Cal?

891
01:17:14,395 --> 01:17:17,831
I guess that's
what you're built for, hmm?

892
01:17:17,832 --> 01:17:21,015
It's admirable,
but it will do you no good here.

893
01:17:34,015 --> 01:17:36,853
Face it.

894
01:17:38,853 --> 01:17:40,519
No.

895
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:42,425
Not me.

896
01:17:44,425 --> 01:17:46,093
No tricks this time.

897
01:17:46,094 --> 01:17:47,560
No traps this time.

898
01:17:47,561 --> 01:17:50,529
The great white is
the ultimate obstacle.

899
01:17:50,530 --> 01:17:54,608
Get out of the water,
that's it. You win.

900
01:18:00,608 --> 01:18:02,243
Hey, we can make it.

901
01:18:03,243 --> 01:18:04,448
But not together.

902
01:18:07,448 --> 01:18:09,086
W-what are you doing?

903
01:18:12,086 --> 01:18:14,253
We go in together,
we die together.

904
01:18:14,254 --> 01:18:17,156
But if one of us can distract
the shark long enough,

905
01:18:17,157 --> 01:18:18,758
the other can get to shore.

906
01:18:18,759 --> 01:18:19,993
Distract the shark?

907
01:18:19,994 --> 01:18:22,595
But th-that's suicide.

908
01:18:22,596 --> 01:18:25,830
Probably, but if I can
distract it long enough,

909
01:18:25,831 --> 01:18:27,136
then you can get to shore.

910
01:18:29,136 --> 01:18:30,970
What? N-no.

911
01:18:30,971 --> 01:18:32,108
No, you can't do that. No.

912
01:18:34,108 --> 01:18:35,578
We have to face it.

913
01:18:37,578 --> 01:18:39,946
But I need you to get to shore.

914
01:18:39,947 --> 01:18:42,648
I promised you're gonna live.

915
01:18:42,649 --> 01:18:45,318
I'll get to the shore,

916
01:18:45,319 --> 01:18:47,621
and then I'll
distract the shark

917
01:18:47,622 --> 01:18:49,589
so you can come over.

918
01:18:49,590 --> 01:18:50,506
That's the plan.

919
01:19:05,506 --> 01:19:06,979
There!

920
01:19:11,979 --> 01:19:14,894
Cal!

921
01:19:26,894 --> 01:19:28,469
No!

922
01:19:35,469 --> 01:19:36,502
Ragan.

923
01:19:36,503 --> 01:19:39,542
Ragan.

924
01:19:41,542 --> 01:19:43,710
Ragan...

925
01:19:43,711 --> 01:19:44,711
I got it.

926
01:19:44,712 --> 01:19:46,313
You did?

927
01:19:46,314 --> 01:19:47,813
Is it really dead?

928
01:19:47,814 --> 01:19:49,021
Yeah. I really
killed it.

929
01:19:55,021 --> 01:19:56,525
Let's get out of here.

930
01:19:58,525 --> 01:19:59,863
Oh, God.

931
01:20:02,863 --> 01:20:04,068
- Ohh!
- Ahh!

932
01:20:07,068 --> 01:20:09,105
Ragan!

933
01:20:12,105 --> 01:20:13,047
Cal!

934
01:20:21,047 --> 01:20:22,925
Ragan!

935
01:20:30,925 --> 01:20:32,597
Ahh! Come on!

936
01:20:37,597 --> 01:20:39,275
Cal!

937
01:20:48,275 --> 01:20:49,891
Cal!

938
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:21,107
Bitch!

939
01:21:21,108 --> 01:21:22,442
See, I--

940
01:21:22,443 --> 01:21:24,410
I can't let you
leave the island.

941
01:21:24,411 --> 01:21:25,148
I won't let you.

942
01:21:27,148 --> 01:21:29,516
If I'm not leaving,
neither are you.

943
01:21:36,423 --> 01:21:38,828
God!

944
01:21:41,828 --> 01:21:44,465
Yaah! Bitch!

945
01:22:01,649 --> 01:22:03,316
See? Heh.

946
01:22:03,317 --> 01:22:06,957
Tiburon likes drama.

947
01:22:10,957 --> 01:22:15,528
But I told him it would
be a lot more easier

948
01:22:15,529 --> 01:22:17,964
if I put a bullet

949
01:22:17,965 --> 01:22:19,005
in your vapid little head.

950
01:22:25,639 --> 01:22:26,613
Oh, sh...

951
01:23:05,613 --> 01:23:07,954
The game's over, tiburon.

952
01:23:14,954 --> 01:23:18,691
Ah. So the last man
standing is a woman.

953
01:23:18,692 --> 01:23:19,698
Well done, ragan.

954
01:23:24,698 --> 01:23:27,366
You're not getting off
of this island alive.

955
01:23:27,367 --> 01:23:28,369
Who's going to stop me?

956
01:23:29,369 --> 01:23:30,704
I will.

957
01:23:31,704 --> 01:23:33,881
I already killed your whore.

958
01:23:40,881 --> 01:23:41,551
Ah...

959
01:23:44,551 --> 01:23:45,090
Elena.

960
01:23:49,090 --> 01:23:51,991
But whores are replaceable.

961
01:23:51,992 --> 01:23:54,993
You're not
gonna get the chance.

962
01:23:54,994 --> 01:23:56,929
You people...

963
01:23:56,930 --> 01:23:58,997
Killed my son,

964
01:23:58,998 --> 01:24:00,666
my only pride and joy.

965
01:24:00,667 --> 01:24:02,002
I said I would have revenge,

966
01:24:03,002 --> 01:24:04,405
and I did!

967
01:24:05,405 --> 01:24:07,907
It's over!

968
01:24:07,908 --> 01:24:09,342
Tell me where we are!

969
01:24:09,343 --> 01:24:12,150
You're 100 Miles South
of key west.

970
01:24:17,150 --> 01:24:20,752
International waters.

971
01:24:20,753 --> 01:24:23,090
You know what
that means, don't you?

972
01:24:23,091 --> 01:24:26,492
I've got a yacht
in my harbor, several.

973
01:24:26,493 --> 01:24:28,495
You can take one.

974
01:24:28,496 --> 01:24:30,395
You've earned your freedom.

975
01:24:30,396 --> 01:24:33,000
That's not what I want anymore.
