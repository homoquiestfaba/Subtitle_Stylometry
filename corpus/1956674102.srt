1
00:02:14,308 --> 00:02:15,434
Rambo!

2
00:02:21,731 --> 00:02:22,857
Smurf!

3
00:02:56,891 --> 00:02:59,310
Goal!

4
00:02:59,351 --> 00:03:02,063
Goal!
- Go, Wolf!

5
00:03:03,147 --> 00:03:04,273
Wolf!

6
00:03:04,315 --> 00:03:07,276
Let's go.
One more before bed.

7
00:03:12,616 --> 00:03:13,949
Lady...

8
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:15,326
What?

9
00:03:15,369 --> 00:03:16,535
You see him?

10
00:03:18,372 --> 00:03:19,498
Lady?

11
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:23,627
The Messenger's here.

12
00:03:28,632 --> 00:03:30,259
Harder!

13
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:35,639
Harder soldiers!

14
00:03:37,891 --> 00:03:39,268
Swede!

15
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:44,104
Smurf, you finally grew up!

16
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:46,982
Dog!

17
00:03:49,067 --> 00:03:51,069
Show me your war face!

18
00:03:52,571 --> 00:03:56,159
Wolf, I leave you alone
and you get fat.

19
00:04:14,427 --> 00:04:15,969
Come on, Monos!

20
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:19,014
Show me strength, show me energy...

21
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:23,268
Show me courage.

22
00:04:27,856 --> 00:04:29,733
We work for the Organization.

23
00:04:30,651 --> 00:04:32,821
The Organization is our family.

24
00:04:38,033 --> 00:04:39,452
You're my children.

25
00:04:40,994 --> 00:04:42,662
You're the Monos.

26
00:04:43,538 --> 00:04:45,708
Keep it up!

27
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:47,918
Tiger jump!

28
00:04:48,837 --> 00:04:50,170
Higher!

29
00:04:52,755 --> 00:04:54,007
Attention!

30
00:04:55,258 --> 00:04:56,509
Inspection!

31
00:04:59,679 --> 00:05:03,016
Smurf, that rifle should be
resting by your foot.

32
00:05:06,812 --> 00:05:09,273
Wolf, that's no military stance.

33
00:05:09,315 --> 00:05:12,818
You're the squad leader. What
kind of example is that?

34
00:05:14,277 --> 00:05:15,653
Attention!

35
00:05:17,823 --> 00:05:20,033
Pick up that shoulder strap, soldier.

36
00:05:29,377 --> 00:05:32,588
I bring you greetings and supplies.

37
00:05:33,296 --> 00:05:35,673
And also a new recruit.

38
00:05:35,716 --> 00:05:37,885
Her name is Shakira.

39
00:05:37,925 --> 00:05:40,177
Shakira is a milk cow.

40
00:05:41,347 --> 00:05:44,850
She makes very tasty milk.
With lots of vitamins.

41
00:05:46,769 --> 00:05:48,646
But Shakira is not a gift.

42
00:05:48,936 --> 00:05:54,066
She's a loan to the Organization.
A contribution to our cause.

43
00:05:54,109 --> 00:05:57,363
At the end of this mission,
we will return her to her owner.

44
00:05:57,405 --> 00:05:59,907
Looking as pretty
as she does today.

45
00:05:59,947 --> 00:06:03,285
If we don't, nobody
will lend us anything.

46
00:06:03,325 --> 00:06:07,329
Instead, they will betray us,
and reveal our position.

47
00:06:07,705 --> 00:06:11,375
Guarding Shakira is as important
to the Organization...

48
00:06:11,669 --> 00:06:14,630
as the security of our prisoner of war.

49
00:06:17,174 --> 00:06:18,465
Is that clear?

50
00:06:19,384 --> 00:06:20,803
Is that clear?

51
00:06:24,932 --> 00:06:27,059
Does anyone have anything to say?

52
00:06:31,939 --> 00:06:33,605
Speak soldier.

53
00:06:33,648 --> 00:06:35,859
Permission
to milk Shakira, Sir.

54
00:06:35,901 --> 00:06:39,196
Do you know what happens
if a milk cow is not milked?

55
00:06:39,236 --> 00:06:41,405
No, Sir.
-She explodes!

56
00:06:41,448 --> 00:06:44,409
You're now in charge of Shakira.
Back in line.

57
00:06:46,453 --> 00:06:47,913
Anybody else?

58
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:53,961
Speak soldier.
- Wolf has something to say.

59
00:06:54,001 --> 00:06:55,419
Back in line.

60
00:07:05,137 --> 00:07:07,474
Speak up, squad leader.

61
00:07:09,266 --> 00:07:13,230
Sir! Permission to be Lady's partner.
- Back in line.

62
00:07:22,697 --> 00:07:26,118
Is this true, soldier?
You want to be Wolf's partner?

63
00:07:27,452 --> 00:07:28,995
Yes, Sir.

64
00:07:30,537 --> 00:07:32,080
I approve this partnership!

65
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:37,336
Stop being so difficult...
- Here, let me do it.

66
00:07:44,386 --> 00:07:47,013
Do you want me to braid your hair?

67
00:07:47,847 --> 00:07:50,975
Braids?
- Yes.

68
00:07:51,017 --> 00:07:54,145
We're the only ones
who know how to make them.

69
00:07:55,061 --> 00:07:57,731
Because they're very special.

70
00:07:57,774 --> 00:08:00,191
Here, look.

71
00:08:03,655 --> 00:08:05,447
You want me to do them?

72
00:08:07,408 --> 00:08:09,494
Wait, wait. Stay still.

73
00:08:12,789 --> 00:08:15,625
Look, they're really pretty.

74
00:08:16,292 --> 00:08:19,128
You tell me.

75
00:08:19,378 --> 00:08:21,923
I know you're going to like them.

76
00:08:21,963 --> 00:08:23,549
But don't touch.

77
00:08:30,972 --> 00:08:32,849
Pretty, right?

78
00:08:38,397 --> 00:08:40,858
Wolf, give her a cigarette.

79
00:08:44,278 --> 00:08:46,655
How do you like your new shoes?

80
00:08:48,532 --> 00:08:51,410
They're a little big, but okay.

81
00:08:56,457 --> 00:08:58,542
Rambo, hand her the paper.

82
00:09:02,878 --> 00:09:05,841
Take off the blanket
and roll up her pants.

83
00:09:11,555 --> 00:09:13,765
Smoking is bad for your health.

84
00:09:13,807 --> 00:09:17,269
You should take advantage
of your time here and quit.

85
00:09:23,191 --> 00:09:26,026
Do you like my horse?
- Yes.

86
00:09:33,535 --> 00:09:35,287
Hold up the newspaper.

87
00:09:41,377 --> 00:09:43,085
Now read it.

88
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,595
Fraud in Japan.

89
00:09:54,472 --> 00:09:58,976
One hundred pregnant women...

90
00:10:06,317 --> 00:10:08,194
Shut up back there!

91
00:10:09,236 --> 00:10:10,571
Start over.

92
00:10:11,614 --> 00:10:16,368
One hundred pregnant women...

93
00:10:17,203 --> 00:10:19,039
seek justice...

94
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:23,710
for the sale of fake birth control pills.

95
00:10:24,711 --> 00:10:27,380
Squad! Dismissed!

96
00:10:28,881 --> 00:10:30,590
Escort Doctora to her room.

97
00:10:32,134 --> 00:10:33,719
Take care of her.

98
00:10:34,179 --> 00:10:36,097
Until next time, commandos.

99
00:11:17,097 --> 00:11:19,599
Come here, Rambo!

100
00:11:20,682 --> 00:11:22,267
Bigfoot, catch him!

101
00:11:22,309 --> 00:11:24,311
Don't let him get away!

102
00:11:26,356 --> 00:11:28,023
Hold him!

103
00:11:28,064 --> 00:11:29,524
Hit him!

104
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,194
One!

105
00:11:31,527 --> 00:11:32,778
Two!

106
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:36,282
Three! Four!

107
00:11:36,323 --> 00:11:37,617
My turn!

108
00:11:38,743 --> 00:11:41,703
Five! six!
-My turn!

109
00:11:42,203 --> 00:11:43,623
Hit him!

110
00:11:43,664 --> 00:11:45,124
Harder!

111
00:11:45,165 --> 00:11:48,002
You need to hit hard!

112
00:11:48,585 --> 00:11:50,920
Seven! Eight!

113
00:11:50,962 --> 00:11:54,133
Not on the head!
- Nine! Ten!

114
00:11:55,592 --> 00:11:56,843
Eleven!

115
00:11:56,886 --> 00:11:58,262
Me, me, me!

116
00:11:58,303 --> 00:11:59,304
Twelve!

117
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,893
Thirteen! Fourteen!

118
00:12:03,934 --> 00:12:05,436
Go for it, Wolfie!

119
00:12:07,396 --> 00:12:09,524
Come on!
- Come on, Doctora!

120
00:12:09,565 --> 00:12:12,317
Come on!
If you don't, I will!

121
00:12:12,358 --> 00:12:14,736
Come on, Doctora, get on with it.
- Do it!

122
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:16,030
Hard!

123
00:12:18,032 --> 00:12:19,659
Don't think about it. Do it!

124
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,536
Hard!
-Do it, Doctora!

125
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,289
No!

126
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:27,958
Harder or I'll give it to Bigfoot.

127
00:12:27,999 --> 00:12:30,544
Hard, it's gotta be hard!

128
00:12:30,585 --> 00:12:32,504
I swear I'll give it to Bigfoot.

129
00:12:32,546 --> 00:12:34,630
Go for it! Hard!

130
00:12:38,302 --> 00:12:40,595
Fifteen!

131
00:12:42,764 --> 00:12:45,099
What say you?

132
00:12:45,141 --> 00:12:48,269
You're turning old, cold and blue!

133
00:12:48,312 --> 00:12:52,023
But there's no one alive,
who is you-er than you!

134
00:12:52,066 --> 00:12:53,692
You sleep happy with a gun...

135
00:12:53,733 --> 00:12:55,694
And wake up with the sun!

136
00:12:55,735 --> 00:12:57,529
Happy birthday to you!

137
00:12:57,571 --> 00:12:59,364
Happy birthday to you!

138
00:13:03,953 --> 00:13:07,372
You're an old man now.
- Happy birthday!

139
00:13:08,832 --> 00:13:11,376
Happy 15th, Rambo!
Give it up for the birthday boy!

140
00:13:11,417 --> 00:13:13,544
Let's throw a party!

141
00:13:59,924 --> 00:14:00,925
Try here.

142
00:14:14,063 --> 00:14:15,231
That's it.

143
00:14:28,619 --> 00:14:30,453
I can't do it.

144
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:45,719
What?
- Nothing.

145
00:14:46,179 --> 00:14:50,058
Then why are you laughing?
-You kiss weird.

146
00:14:50,099 --> 00:14:52,601
Weird? Weird how?

147
00:14:53,102 --> 00:14:56,147
I don't know, it feels funny. It tickles.

148
00:14:58,607 --> 00:15:02,361
You're making it up.
- Why would I make that up?

149
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:06,657
To make me look like an ass.
-Why don't you try with Rambo?

150
00:15:06,699 --> 00:15:09,243
Rambo is like my brother.
-No, what for?

151
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:12,746
Just to know.

152
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:17,835
What?

153
00:15:23,466 --> 00:15:25,049
You promise?

154
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:37,020
How was that?
-Normal.

155
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,106
No, no, no. Come here.

156
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:56,665
What's so funny?

157
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:59,208
Are you happy now?
- Yes.

158
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:05,633
Coming down!

159
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:38,122
Make way for Boom Boom
and the trunk.

160
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:40,667
Anything else?
- No, that's it.

161
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:45,088
Smurf, you're gonna lose another machete?

162
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:49,051
How's my nest?
- It's looking really good.

163
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:53,763
All this work to build this thing
just so Wolf and Lady can break it tonight.

164
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:00,103
Done.

165
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:18,371
You like it?

166
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:22,559
To Wolf and Lady!

167
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:25,647
To Wolf and Lady!

168
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,865
Here I go. Three, two...

169
00:19:21,867 --> 00:19:24,162
Dog, hold her!
Holy shit!

170
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,546
She's waking up.

171
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,309
Move over, I want to see.
- Stop pushing.

172
00:19:48,186 --> 00:19:51,607
She's upset because we didn't
invite her to Wolf's party.

173
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:00,198
Bye!

174
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,163
Oh, little Bigfoot.

175
00:20:10,165 --> 00:20:11,502
Shut up, dumbass.

176
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,895
The party lives on, motherfuckers!

177
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,814
There we go! What a beauty!

178
00:20:35,065 --> 00:20:36,942
My father used to say:

179
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:40,446
"Why are you such a whore?"

180
00:20:41,239 --> 00:20:44,534
"You fucked the whole neighborhood!"

181
00:20:45,075 --> 00:20:47,244
"Why are you such a whore?"

182
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:48,621
Shut up!

183
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,327
Wolf!

184
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:34,334
Calm down, Wolf!

185
00:21:36,544 --> 00:21:38,796
You're gonna kill him!

186
00:21:39,128 --> 00:21:41,423
No! Fucking stop!

187
00:21:43,132 --> 00:21:45,802
Son of a bitch! You killed the cow!

188
00:21:45,845 --> 00:21:48,137
It's all over now!

189
00:21:49,181 --> 00:21:51,225
It is my responsibility!

190
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:49,074
The shovel.

191
00:22:55,204 --> 00:22:56,290
Ready?

192
00:23:00,502 --> 00:23:01,795
Close it.

193
00:23:33,867 --> 00:23:38,332
It's not Wolf's fault.
Dog shot the cow.

194
00:23:38,372 --> 00:23:41,292
But Wolf is our leader.
He'll have to take the fall.

195
00:23:41,335 --> 00:23:43,920
That soldier's getting court-martialed.
-For sure.

196
00:23:43,962 --> 00:23:46,423
Shut up.
-Why? It's the truth.

197
00:23:46,465 --> 00:23:50,008
He'll be executed.
-Stop talking shit.

198
00:23:50,884 --> 00:23:53,887
What shit, Rambo? I didn't make the rules.

199
00:23:54,222 --> 00:23:56,307
If you don't like it,
go cry with Wolf.

200
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:58,517
Enough. Everybody shut up.

201
00:24:11,072 --> 00:24:13,992
What's wrong, Rambo?
You gonna shut me up?

202
00:24:16,703 --> 00:24:19,581
Can you believe this guy?
- Rambo, no.

203
00:24:21,207 --> 00:24:22,500
Asshole.

204
00:24:26,044 --> 00:24:27,505
Go ahead!

205
00:24:27,545 --> 00:24:29,464
No, no!

206
00:24:29,507 --> 00:24:32,050
Let them kill each other.
- Shut up!

207
00:24:34,427 --> 00:24:37,555
Bigfoot, stop!

208
00:24:49,192 --> 00:24:51,069
Show is over.

209
00:24:51,112 --> 00:24:52,571
Bigfoot!

210
00:24:53,907 --> 00:24:55,158
You're leaving?

211
00:24:55,698 --> 00:24:58,286
You want some more, asshole?

212
00:25:03,206 --> 00:25:06,084
Enough! That's enough!
- Take it easy!

213
00:25:06,127 --> 00:25:10,214
Rambo, leave him alone.
- Let's go.

214
00:25:12,465 --> 00:25:14,842
You think you're the boss now?
- Let's go.

215
00:25:32,069 --> 00:25:34,530
I'm not letting all that meat go to waste.

216
00:25:34,572 --> 00:25:37,533
Bigfoot's right, we have to eat it.

217
00:25:38,033 --> 00:25:40,661
Everybody has to help. Doctora too.

218
00:25:40,703 --> 00:25:43,246
Meat, meat, meat!
Is that all you can think about?

219
00:25:43,289 --> 00:25:45,458
The cow is dead!

220
00:25:50,127 --> 00:25:52,380
I won't let the meat rot.

221
00:25:59,847 --> 00:26:02,099
One, two, three.

222
00:26:09,607 --> 00:26:11,233
One, two...

223
00:26:11,273 --> 00:26:12,274
three!

224
00:26:38,886 --> 00:26:40,387
Hold the cow.

225
00:26:42,554 --> 00:26:44,641
Smurf, cut here.

226
00:26:50,147 --> 00:26:52,024
Give me that knife.

227
00:26:52,439 --> 00:26:54,776
What shovel? It's never gonna work
with a shovel!

228
00:26:54,816 --> 00:26:56,193
You guys open it up
and I'll pull.

229
00:27:43,908 --> 00:27:46,369
Guys, the heart.

230
00:29:17,376 --> 00:29:18,960
Wolf killed himself.

231
00:29:45,235 --> 00:29:48,739
Shakira's meat tastes better
than her milk.

232
00:29:50,866 --> 00:29:53,911
We need to get on the radio
and report what happened.

233
00:29:56,246 --> 00:29:58,123
And what are we going to say?

234
00:29:59,292 --> 00:30:01,920
That Wolf killed the cow
and then killed himself.

235
00:30:03,088 --> 00:30:04,798
That's a lie!

236
00:30:05,173 --> 00:30:06,633
Then what do you want to say?

237
00:30:07,092 --> 00:30:10,053
That Dog killed the cow so he gets executed
by a firing squad?

238
00:30:10,095 --> 00:30:12,012
What good would that do?

239
00:30:13,388 --> 00:30:14,682
We can't lie.

240
00:30:15,433 --> 00:30:17,936
We'll all be court-martialed.

241
00:30:17,978 --> 00:30:20,564
This doesn't have to leave this place.

242
00:30:22,397 --> 00:30:25,275
I think it at least deserves a vote.

243
00:30:25,611 --> 00:30:27,778
Who wants to kill Dog?

244
00:30:43,628 --> 00:30:46,421
Dog killed the cow.
I won't forget that.

245
00:30:50,593 --> 00:30:53,263
She just needs a new partner.

246
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:07,527
Looks like that one
needs a new partner too.

247
00:31:12,115 --> 00:31:15,285
I'm stuffed.
Take that to Doctora.

248
00:31:18,621 --> 00:31:19,830
Dog!

249
00:31:21,541 --> 00:31:22,707
Get over here.

250
00:34:08,414 --> 00:34:11,125
Messenger to Monos.
Do you copy?

251
00:34:12,043 --> 00:34:14,170
Messenger calling Monos.

252
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:19,300
Messenger to Monos.
Do you copy?

253
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:23,386
Copy you on four.

254
00:34:24,387 --> 00:34:26,765
Monos with news.

255
00:34:29,185 --> 00:34:30,854
Go ahead. Report.

256
00:34:32,731 --> 00:34:34,022
Proceed.

257
00:34:35,566 --> 00:34:37,651
Report your news!

258
00:34:39,612 --> 00:34:42,115
The squad leader flew into the night.

259
00:34:47,578 --> 00:34:48,872
Go on!

260
00:34:51,332 --> 00:34:53,001
How come?

261
00:34:55,211 --> 00:34:56,670
Answer me!

262
00:35:02,927 --> 00:35:05,721
The squad leader killed Shakira.
Then he shot himself.

263
00:35:06,097 --> 00:35:08,975
It was an accident.
He was drunk.

264
00:35:15,439 --> 00:35:17,358
We need a proof of life.

265
00:35:19,235 --> 00:35:23,280
Our commander has contact
with the family on an open line.

266
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:27,243
Swede, Smurf, go get Doctora.

267
00:35:30,329 --> 00:35:31,997
Good job, Lady.

268
00:37:10,137 --> 00:37:11,804
Did they ask you about the cow?

269
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,391
Doctora.

270
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:18,436
Did they ask about the cow?

271
00:38:19,496 --> 00:38:22,917
Bury Wolf in an unmarked grave.

272
00:38:23,459 --> 00:38:26,087
Divide his gear among the squad.

273
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:29,423
Lady's turn.

274
00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:33,135
Now me.

275
00:38:33,635 --> 00:38:34,762
Dog.

276
00:38:35,221 --> 00:38:36,388
Smurf.

277
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:41,310
Bigfoot, the high command
has made you squad leader.

278
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:44,271
Boom Boom will be
second-in-command.

279
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:45,982
Lady.

280
00:38:46,398 --> 00:38:47,691
Swede.

281
00:38:47,733 --> 00:38:48,860
Boom Boom.

282
00:38:48,901 --> 00:38:52,363
Attention, there are reports
of enemies in your area.

283
00:38:52,404 --> 00:38:55,616
Our mobile unit 33 is heading
your way to provide support.

284
00:38:56,242 --> 00:38:58,619
Strength. Courage.
Over and out.

285
00:38:58,660 --> 00:38:59,786
Smurf.

286
00:39:00,037 --> 00:39:01,288
Boom Boom.

287
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:03,290
Me.

288
00:39:03,832 --> 00:39:05,001
Dog.

289
00:39:06,418 --> 00:39:07,711
Rambo.

290
00:39:08,295 --> 00:39:10,172
Who wants the spoon?

291
00:40:29,042 --> 00:40:32,253
You idiots are rolling around
in Shakira's shit.

292
00:40:43,556 --> 00:40:45,683
Look what she left us.

293
00:40:48,478 --> 00:40:49,938
Shrooms!

294
00:41:47,244 --> 00:41:49,079
How do I get this off you?

295
00:41:49,121 --> 00:41:52,542
We need to find us a bed.
- What are you doing, Bigfoot?

296
00:41:53,125 --> 00:41:54,752
What, motherfucker?

297
00:42:07,431 --> 00:42:09,183
Swede!

298
00:42:11,018 --> 00:42:12,895
Can't you hear me?

299
00:42:14,188 --> 00:42:15,565
Boom!

300
00:42:16,566 --> 00:42:18,150
Boom Boom!

301
00:43:16,083 --> 00:43:17,792
Ambush! Ambush!

302
00:43:29,721 --> 00:43:32,098
Help! Get the med kit!

303
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:33,392
Bigfoot!

304
00:43:34,684 --> 00:43:36,270
Where are you?

305
00:43:36,311 --> 00:43:39,063
Monos, the unit has been hit!

306
00:43:47,113 --> 00:43:50,199
We have a code red.
I repeat we have a code red!

307
00:43:50,241 --> 00:43:53,828
The wounded are retreating to your bunker.

308
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:16,184
If they try to rescue you, I have to kill you.
Those are my orders.

309
00:44:17,393 --> 00:44:18,728
Move it!

310
00:44:51,677 --> 00:44:53,888
It's your fault we're here.

311
00:44:56,390 --> 00:45:00,186
It's your fault we're in this fucking place,
freezing our asses off.

312
00:45:26,545 --> 00:45:29,298
Have you ever killed anybody?

313
00:45:44,438 --> 00:45:47,441
I can help you...

314
00:45:50,694 --> 00:45:52,321
with...

315
00:45:53,155 --> 00:45:54,698
anything.

316
00:46:00,871 --> 00:46:02,456
What do you want?

317
00:46:07,961 --> 00:46:09,588
What do you want?

318
00:46:14,677 --> 00:46:16,303
What do you want?

319
00:46:18,221 --> 00:46:20,307
I want to dance on television.

320
00:46:21,433 --> 00:46:22,976
Television?

321
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:51,004
We'll get out of here together.

322
00:48:47,369 --> 00:48:48,830
Get up!

323
00:48:50,998 --> 00:48:52,959
Sorry, Bigfoot.

324
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,668
Hey, Doctora.

325
00:48:55,669 --> 00:48:57,463
We won last night.

326
00:48:59,048 --> 00:49:00,549
We're leaving.

327
00:49:00,841 --> 00:49:02,468
I have new coordinates.

328
00:49:04,136 --> 00:49:06,263
Fucking cool, right?

329
00:49:08,265 --> 00:49:10,684
Come on. Let me introduce you
to some friends.

330
00:49:10,726 --> 00:49:14,146
Mobile unit 33
of the rebel Organization.

331
00:49:14,605 --> 00:49:16,940
All special forces and militia.

332
00:49:17,566 --> 00:49:19,526
They're hardcore.

333
00:49:22,238 --> 00:49:23,989
Come, Doctora.
-Yes.

334
00:49:28,910 --> 00:49:31,580
Hey, you guys fought hard yesterday.

335
00:49:31,955 --> 00:49:32,956
Come.

336
00:49:44,551 --> 00:49:45,802
Come on, Doctora.

337
00:49:59,149 --> 00:50:01,943
Let's go, Doctora.
Pack your things.

338
00:50:02,736 --> 00:50:04,362
I'll be back in a minute.

339
00:50:45,445 --> 00:50:46,863
We're leaving, Doctora.

340
00:51:03,296 --> 00:51:05,506
They know where we are.

341
00:51:05,548 --> 00:51:07,425
We march to new coordinates.

342
00:51:07,883 --> 00:51:11,096
It's a long trip but we need
to get Doctora out of here.

343
00:51:11,137 --> 00:51:13,223
Rambo, you take point.

344
00:51:13,264 --> 00:51:15,808
Dog and Boom Boom, rearguard.

345
00:51:15,850 --> 00:51:18,186
Lady, you're with me.

346
00:51:20,105 --> 00:51:21,522
Let's go.

347
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:27,903
I hope you like the heat, Doctora.

348
00:53:38,867 --> 00:53:40,494
Doctora!

349
00:54:28,625 --> 00:54:30,543
Doctora!

350
00:54:30,835 --> 00:54:33,546
Doctora got away from me!

351
00:55:06,329 --> 00:55:08,539
Monos to Messenger.
Do you copy?

352
00:55:09,498 --> 00:55:11,875
Change the frequency.

353
00:55:12,918 --> 00:55:15,671
Monos to Messenger.
Do you copy?

354
00:55:17,798 --> 00:55:20,843
The sooner we report the escape...

355
00:55:21,219 --> 00:55:23,011
Bigfoot, don't!

356
00:55:23,387 --> 00:55:24,680
Bigfoot!

357
00:55:25,181 --> 00:55:27,600
We need to report this
to the Messenger.

358
00:55:29,977 --> 00:55:32,020
No need to report to anyone.

359
00:55:33,397 --> 00:55:35,858
We are our own Organization now.

360
00:55:35,899 --> 00:55:37,943
Doctora belongs to us.

361
00:55:39,862 --> 00:55:41,280
Smurf.

362
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:44,492
Don't come back without her.

363
00:55:44,867 --> 00:55:47,286
There's no place for you here
without her.

364
00:55:48,078 --> 00:55:49,330
Go!

365
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:01,759
What about all of you?

366
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:04,928
Sweep the area.

367
00:56:04,970 --> 00:56:06,430
Dog, you go west.

368
00:56:07,515 --> 00:56:09,349
Boom Boom, follow him.

369
00:56:10,392 --> 00:56:12,645
Swede, head east.

370
00:56:17,482 --> 00:56:18,817
Asshole.

371
00:56:19,693 --> 00:56:21,779
Lady, you stay here.

372
00:56:26,074 --> 00:56:27,910
But bring me my vest.

373
00:56:30,203 --> 00:56:32,080
You trashed the radio.

374
00:56:35,083 --> 00:56:36,710
Messenger calling Monos.

375
01:00:45,498 --> 01:00:47,125
Doctora!

376
01:00:47,918 --> 01:00:49,544
You stole my machete!

377
01:01:27,039 --> 01:01:28,874
Grab her, Boom Boom!

378
01:01:28,916 --> 01:01:32,086
Hold her, Lady. Don't let go.

379
01:01:32,127 --> 01:01:33,713
Hold her tight!

380
01:01:34,004 --> 01:01:35,381
Here, Smurf.

381
01:01:36,716 --> 01:01:38,133
Chain her.

382
01:01:45,558 --> 01:01:47,267
Swede, hold her feet!

383
01:01:47,310 --> 01:01:48,811
What the fuck, Smurf.
- I can't!

384
01:01:48,853 --> 01:01:50,938
Dog! Hold her!

385
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:53,733
Do I have to do everything?

386
01:01:53,774 --> 01:01:55,150
Rambo, come here.

387
01:01:55,192 --> 01:01:56,736
Smurf, let go.

388
01:01:58,153 --> 01:01:59,572
Your turn.

389
01:02:09,790 --> 01:02:11,876
Do it Rambo! Now!

390
01:02:17,464 --> 01:02:20,217
Hold her, Swede.
- Do it now!

391
01:02:20,801 --> 01:02:23,387
Grab her hands!
- Come on, Rambo!

392
01:02:23,679 --> 01:02:27,850
You could've been eaten by
a wild animal! Look at yourself.

393
01:02:27,892 --> 01:02:29,769
Lock it!

394
01:02:30,227 --> 01:02:32,187
Get on with it, Rambo!

395
01:02:41,781 --> 01:02:44,033
It's for your own good.

396
01:02:47,494 --> 01:02:48,829
Move away.

397
01:02:51,248 --> 01:02:53,417
Doctora, why'd you have to run away?

398
01:02:54,584 --> 01:02:59,548
We treated you well. We fed you,
we showed you love. Didn't we?

399
01:03:01,967 --> 01:03:04,303
You gave us no choice, Doctora.

400
01:03:08,515 --> 01:03:10,976
You decided to run away.

401
01:03:15,230 --> 01:03:17,232
Did you check that chain?

402
01:03:30,412 --> 01:03:31,955
Stop crying.

403
01:03:37,168 --> 01:03:39,296
You want to be chained too?

404
01:03:47,053 --> 01:03:48,597
Rambo!

405
01:03:48,930 --> 01:03:50,807
There's no crying here.

406
01:03:52,392 --> 01:03:54,811
Tonight we celebrate!

407
01:03:57,856 --> 01:04:00,567
He's so sentimental.

408
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:03,653
Go fuck yourself.
- Good job, Rambo.

409
01:04:06,573 --> 01:04:08,450
Good hunting, Monos.

410
01:06:59,953 --> 01:07:01,621
You're not going to speak?

411
01:07:07,627 --> 01:07:10,255
Doctora, I have something for you.

412
01:07:10,922 --> 01:07:12,799
Say hello to the camera.

413
01:07:15,468 --> 01:07:18,430
Bigfoot, what's going on?

414
01:07:18,471 --> 01:07:21,433
She's not saying anything.

415
01:07:21,474 --> 01:07:23,226
What's going on here?

416
01:07:27,439 --> 01:07:29,816
I'm wasting my time.

417
01:07:34,321 --> 01:07:38,032
Look at what you've done to her.
You've lost control of this shit.

418
01:07:38,491 --> 01:07:41,786
Was this job too big for you?

419
01:07:43,871 --> 01:07:46,708
You can't handle being squad leader?

420
01:07:47,292 --> 01:07:50,002
What a fucking disappointment.

421
01:07:52,839 --> 01:07:55,592
Swede, why doesn't anyone
answer the radio?

422
01:07:55,633 --> 01:07:57,051
I don't know, Sir.

423
01:07:57,093 --> 01:07:59,011
You never know anything!

424
01:08:02,724 --> 01:08:03,850
Soldiers!

425
01:08:03,891 --> 01:08:06,644
Dog, why are you not wearing a shirt?

426
01:08:06,686 --> 01:08:09,230
Are you a soldier or a bandit?

427
01:08:10,189 --> 01:08:12,108
My shirt's in my tent, Sir.

428
01:08:12,149 --> 01:08:14,193
What kind of answer is that?

429
01:08:16,403 --> 01:08:20,658
Boom Boom, you were
our great hope. Our best soldier.

430
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:22,744
What's going on with Bigfoot?

431
01:08:23,410 --> 01:08:24,996
He's the best.

432
01:08:27,039 --> 01:08:30,167
Why is he the best? Because
he's turned this into a shitshow?

433
01:08:30,209 --> 01:08:31,627
No, Sir.

434
01:08:32,837 --> 01:08:36,048
Lady, who said you and Bigfoot
could be partners?

435
01:08:37,299 --> 01:08:39,218
He and I aren't partners.

436
01:08:39,260 --> 01:08:43,139
Oh, really?
Then why are you sleeping together?

437
01:08:48,936 --> 01:08:51,605
What have you got to say, Boom Boom?

438
01:08:52,481 --> 01:08:53,941
Nothing, Sir.

439
01:08:57,069 --> 01:08:58,445
Faster!

440
01:08:58,487 --> 01:09:00,156
Go, go, go!

441
01:09:01,407 --> 01:09:02,824
Smurf!

442
01:09:02,866 --> 01:09:05,161
Knees high!

443
01:09:08,205 --> 01:09:09,956
Faster, soldier.

444
01:09:10,291 --> 01:09:13,085
Faster! Show me!

445
01:09:13,417 --> 01:09:15,544
Faster! Harder!

446
01:09:15,919 --> 01:09:17,880
Make me feel it.

447
01:09:18,715 --> 01:09:20,884
Lady! Faster!

448
01:09:21,218 --> 01:09:23,512
Eyes up! Hands chest-high!

449
01:09:26,848 --> 01:09:30,018
Rambo! Make it harder!

450
01:09:32,354 --> 01:09:33,647
Level 5!

451
01:09:58,921 --> 01:10:00,673
Almost 300.

452
01:10:04,427 --> 01:10:05,678
302...

453
01:10:06,428 --> 01:10:07,721
303...

454
01:10:09,347 --> 01:10:10,892
304...

455
01:10:10,933 --> 01:10:12,392
Hold it!

456
01:10:18,231 --> 01:10:20,984
You little shits.
Why did you let it fall?

457
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:24,738
Should we go again?

458
01:10:27,533 --> 01:10:29,492
Anyone got anything to say?

459
01:10:30,493 --> 01:10:32,120
Listen up, soldiers!

460
01:10:32,163 --> 01:10:34,082
Anyone got anything to say?

461
01:10:47,385 --> 01:10:49,471
Dog, stand up.

462
01:10:52,433 --> 01:10:55,103
Lady falls asleep on guard duty, Sir.

463
01:10:55,145 --> 01:10:56,562
Sit back down.

464
01:10:56,603 --> 01:10:58,773
Lady, stand up.

465
01:11:00,566 --> 01:11:01,651
Speak up!

466
01:11:02,277 --> 01:11:04,279
Rambo is a crybaby.

467
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:06,489
Sit back down.
Rambo!

468
01:11:08,783 --> 01:11:11,743
Lady is a whore.
She only cares about rank.

469
01:11:12,578 --> 01:11:15,123
There are more serious things happening here.

470
01:11:15,165 --> 01:11:17,499
Something much more serious.

471
01:11:18,543 --> 01:11:21,962
Swede, what have you got to say?

472
01:11:22,297 --> 01:11:24,674
Bigfoot won't let me be
Boom Boom's partner.

473
01:11:25,175 --> 01:11:27,509
Boom Boom, stand up.

474
01:11:27,884 --> 01:11:30,762
You've forgotten our ideology?

475
01:11:30,805 --> 01:11:32,889
Smurf lost his machete.

476
01:11:33,390 --> 01:11:37,018
Tell me more. Speak up, soldier!
Boom Boom!

477
01:11:38,395 --> 01:11:41,065
He also let Doctora escape.

478
01:11:44,485 --> 01:11:46,362
Sit back down, soldier.

479
01:11:49,906 --> 01:11:52,201
This is goddamn rotten.

480
01:11:56,121 --> 01:11:57,582
Smurf!

481
01:11:58,833 --> 01:12:00,209
Stand up!

482
01:12:02,127 --> 01:12:03,253
Smurf!

483
01:12:06,591 --> 01:12:08,800
Speak up, loud and clear.

484
01:12:10,094 --> 01:12:12,178
Dog killed the cow.

485
01:12:15,932 --> 01:12:18,935
You know everything.
Tell me more.

486
01:12:19,519 --> 01:12:20,855
Continue, soldier!

487
01:12:24,524 --> 01:12:27,653
Bigfoot said that we were
our own Organization...

488
01:12:27,694 --> 01:12:30,279
and that Doctora belongs to us.

489
01:12:35,326 --> 01:12:37,453
Sit back down, soldier.

490
01:12:53,637 --> 01:12:56,015
Bigfoot, stand up.

491
01:12:57,266 --> 01:12:59,100
I raised you.

492
01:12:59,559 --> 01:13:02,646
I made you my son and squad leader.

493
01:13:03,647 --> 01:13:07,901
You're coming with me to give
a full report to the high command.

494
01:13:07,943 --> 01:13:10,112
I will represent you.

495
01:15:50,395 --> 01:15:52,605
Smurf!

496
01:15:54,733 --> 01:15:58,070
Smurf, you're a rat!

497
01:19:10,802 --> 01:19:12,221
Who's there?

498
01:19:12,263 --> 01:19:13,805
Be quiet.

499
01:19:15,766 --> 01:19:19,270
What are you doing?
-Be quiet, we're getting out of here.

500
01:19:21,522 --> 01:19:25,025
Where are we going?
-Somewhere else.

501
01:19:28,654 --> 01:19:29,862
Where?

502
01:19:29,905 --> 01:19:32,533
Some place better. Keep quiet.

503
01:19:34,159 --> 01:19:37,870
Bigfoot will kill me.
-Quiet. Nobody's getting killed.

504
01:19:40,748 --> 01:19:42,124
Bigfoot will kill us.

505
01:19:42,167 --> 01:19:45,546
No, he won't, we're leaving.
Pull your hand out.

506
01:20:34,510 --> 01:20:35,846
Rambo!

507
01:20:40,933 --> 01:20:42,267
Rambo!

508
01:20:52,112 --> 01:20:53,445
Rambo!

509
01:20:58,618 --> 01:20:59,952
Rambo.

510
01:21:00,912 --> 01:21:02,247
Rambo.

511
01:21:07,543 --> 01:21:08,669
Rambo!

512
01:21:14,591 --> 01:21:15,800
Lady!

513
01:21:16,302 --> 01:21:18,096
Something moved over there.

514
01:21:22,099 --> 01:21:23,475
Check it out!

515
01:24:19,024 --> 01:24:20,776
Not so fast.

516
01:24:28,283 --> 01:24:30,911
The German city of Bonn...

517
01:24:30,954 --> 01:24:35,333
is the birthplace of the great composer
Ludwig van Beethoven.

518
01:24:35,959 --> 01:24:38,586
Son, move over so he can sit.

519
01:24:39,669 --> 01:24:41,421
Nelson, come here.

520
01:24:43,173 --> 01:24:47,595
It's also home to the even
more popular Gummy Bear.

521
01:24:47,636 --> 01:24:50,348
Invented in 1922,

522
01:24:50,389 --> 01:24:57,355
they now make enough Gummy Bears
each year to circle the world four times.

523
01:25:00,815 --> 01:25:05,363
Gummy Bears have to be hard
enough to keep their shape...

524
01:25:05,904 --> 01:25:09,700
but soft enough to chew.

525
01:25:10,825 --> 01:25:14,997
Detecting faulty Gummy Bears
is the job of young men like this one.

526
01:28:17,344 --> 01:28:19,221
Swede!

527
01:28:29,732 --> 01:28:31,608
Swede!

528
01:28:32,860 --> 01:28:34,528
Swede!

529
01:28:49,836 --> 01:28:51,712
Swede!

530
01:29:49,311 --> 01:29:50,562
No!

531
01:29:50,603 --> 01:29:51,979
No!

532
01:29:54,190 --> 01:29:55,233
No.

533
01:30:17,504 --> 01:30:20,340
Cut the toes off!

534
01:30:55,501 --> 01:30:57,753
Take me with you.

535
01:31:02,758 --> 01:31:04,802
Don't leave me.

536
01:31:09,599 --> 01:31:11,392
Doctora!

537
01:31:12,893 --> 01:31:15,021
Doctora!

538
01:31:19,734 --> 01:31:21,486
Doctora!

539
01:33:03,794 --> 01:33:05,046
Rambo!

540
01:33:14,305 --> 01:33:17,391
Breaking news!
The American Sara Watson...

541
01:33:17,433 --> 01:33:19,728
appears to have escaped
from the Organization.

542
01:33:19,769 --> 01:33:24,274
A few minutes ago, a source
revealed that the kidnapped engineer...

543
01:33:24,315 --> 01:33:26,817
was seen alive in the northwest region.

544
01:33:26,860 --> 01:33:29,904
This news has not been confirmed
by the armed forces.

545
01:33:29,945 --> 01:33:34,950
However, we have received reports that a major military
operation is underway in the area.

546
01:33:34,993 --> 01:33:37,746
Stay tuned.
More news ahead.

547
01:34:49,692 --> 01:34:50,775
Rambo!

548
01:34:54,279 --> 01:34:55,280
Rambo!

549
01:34:56,074 --> 01:34:57,325
Rambo!

550
01:38:37,584 --> 01:38:39,545
This is Harpy 137. Initiating descent.

551
01:38:46,134 --> 01:38:47,969
Base, the city is in sight.

552
01:38:48,011 --> 01:38:49,846
We have news to report.

553
01:38:54,351 --> 01:38:59,023
Unidentified person onboard.
Repeat, unidentified person onboard.

554
01:39:05,737 --> 01:39:08,199
