1
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:01,353
Hello? Hello?

2
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:22,374
Hello?

3
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:42,394
Another day.

4
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,898
Another day.

5
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,670
Go away.

6
00:03:58,672 --> 00:04:00,072
Go away.

7
00:04:13,454 --> 00:04:16,221
When I say stop,
you have to... morning.

8
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:17,656
Have a nice day.

9
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:19,591
<i>Good morning, madam.</i>

10
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:22,060
<i>We at euphoria finance</i>
<i>want to put the "you"</i>

11
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:23,595
<i>back into euphoria.</i>

12
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,731
<i>Your lifestyle is our concern.</i>

13
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:27,799
<i>Your dreams are our dreams.</i>

14
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:31,270
<i>That's why we say,</i>
<i>"enough is never enough."</i>

15
00:04:31,272 --> 00:04:34,506
<i>Call us today and ask for more.</i>

16
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:37,542
<i>Good morning, madam.</i>
<i>We at euphoria...</i>

17
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:40,212
<i>Everyone's getting rich,</i>
<i>except you.</i>

18
00:04:40,214 --> 00:04:44,049
<i>Learn the secrets of their</i>
<i>success tonight at 8 on dumbc.</i>

19
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:46,918
<i>Bored with buddhism,</i>
<i>sick of scientology?</i>

20
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,322
<i>Then the church of Batman</i>
<i>the redeemer may be the answer.</i>

21
00:04:50,324 --> 00:04:52,991
<i>The future has come and gone.</i>

22
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:54,526
<i>Where were you?</i>

23
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:56,395
<i>Don't miss out the next time.</i>

24
00:04:56,397 --> 00:04:59,064
<i>Call 897-3434.</i>

25
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:18,016
<i>Occupy mall street now.</i>

26
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:21,553
<i>Autumn sales have started.</i>
<i>Bargains galore.</i>

27
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:25,190
<i>Up to 100 percent off</i>
<i>selected items.</i>

28
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:28,193
<i>Autumn sales have started.</i>
<i>Bargains galore.</i>

29
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:31,296
<i>Up to 100 percent off</i>
<i>selected items.</i>

30
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:34,299
<i>24 hours a day at babyc.</i>

31
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:36,702
<i>We've cut out all the bad news.</i>

32
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,107
<i>We live in a chaotic,</i>

33
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:43,742
<i>confusing world.</i>

34
00:05:43,744 --> 00:05:45,644
<i>So many choices,</i>

35
00:05:45,646 --> 00:05:48,313
<i>so little time.</i>

36
00:05:48,315 --> 00:05:50,449
<i>What do we need?</i>

37
00:05:50,451 --> 00:05:52,351
<i>Who do we love?</i>

38
00:05:52,353 --> 00:05:55,654
<i>What brings us joy?</i>

39
00:05:57,591 --> 00:06:01,660
<i>Mancom, making sense</i>
<i>of the good things in life.</i>

40
00:06:03,897 --> 00:06:05,063
Ahem.

41
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:07,632
I hope you enjoyed
our presentation.

42
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:09,301
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

43
00:06:09,303 --> 00:06:10,569
Thank you.

44
00:06:10,571 --> 00:06:12,971
Now, if you'll please follow me.

45
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:16,074
Please stay together.
Here's your chance to observe

46
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:20,545
mancom's proprietary q-void
computation system in action.

47
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:23,248
No photos, please.
Thank you.

48
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,851
We call it the power of six.

49
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:27,986
Six degrees of convergence,

50
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:32,290
providing stability
for business or personal needs.

51
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:35,560
As you can see, our company
encourages an atmosphere

52
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:39,131
of vigorous
but healthy competition.

53
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:13,265
<i>Hello, qohen leth.</i>
<i>Corporate health maintenance</i>

54
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:15,667
<i>have approved review</i>
<i>of your disability request</i>

55
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:17,602
<i>for today at 14:40.</i>

56
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,104
<i>Please be prompt.</i>

57
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:22,340
We're nothing if not prompt.

58
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:44,095
All right, Quinn.

59
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:45,430
How's it hanging?

60
00:07:45,432 --> 00:07:49,367
It's qohen, Mr. joby.
And as we've told you before,

61
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:51,870
it isn't hanging well.
We're dying.

62
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:53,738
You should see the medics
about that.

63
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,940
Can't afford to lose you.

64
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:57,242
We have an appointment
this afternoon.

65
00:07:57,244 --> 00:07:58,610
Not this afternoon.

66
00:07:58,612 --> 00:08:00,479
You approved it.
Cancel.

67
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:03,348
You got still the transfinite
paradox project due today.

68
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,318
Finished.

69
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,955
Pathologics division's running
the standard redundancies.

70
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,791
You do all that this morning?

71
00:08:12,793 --> 00:08:15,760
As mentioned to you repeatedly,
we detest working here.

72
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:19,030
Considering our output,
we can't begin to understand

73
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:20,599
why you insist
on our coming here.

74
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:22,901
That's a management issue.

75
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:25,370
It's qohen.
Q, no u,

76
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:29,174
o-h-e-n.
Out of my hands.

77
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:32,110
Then perhaps we should be
talking to management.

78
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:35,447
No, no, no. Nobody
speaks to management.

79
00:08:35,449 --> 00:08:36,848
You know that. No way, no way.

80
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,517
Look, take my advice.

81
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:41,319
Knock off the bitching and
moaning. It's not that bad.

82
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:44,289
We could accept braving
this ghastly place

83
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:46,658
were it not for fear
of missing our call.

84
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,193
Oh, that call, yeah.

85
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:51,229
Could you not let the machine
take it or do call forwarding?

86
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:54,766
I could always bend the rules
on personal calls in your case.

87
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:59,671
We have to be home
to receive it.

88
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:00,906
Look,

89
00:09:00,908 --> 00:09:04,109
I'll see what I can do,
all right?

90
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:05,710
Sorry.

91
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:07,312
We prefer not to be touched.

92
00:09:07,314 --> 00:09:09,214
All right.

93
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:15,820
Qohen leth, ontological
research division,

94
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:19,090
requesting disability leave.

95
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:21,359
Or reassignment to work at home.

96
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:23,728
That's management's
decision, Mr. leth.

97
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,865
We only deal
with health issues here.

98
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:29,801
What seems to be the problem?

99
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:32,337
- We are dying.
- Who's we?

100
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:35,006
Us. Ourselves.

101
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:36,207
But there's only one of you.

102
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:38,310
So it would appear.

103
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:44,616
This subject has undergone
five physicals the last year.

104
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:46,851
He's healthy as a horse.

105
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:50,121
- My hair has fallen out.
- Perfectly normal.

106
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:52,190
You're the most productive

107
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:55,260
number cruncher in your unit.

108
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:56,661
Entity crunchers.

109
00:09:56,663 --> 00:10:02,534
We work with esoteric data
that have a life on their own

110
00:10:02,536 --> 00:10:06,471
and are substantially
more complex than numbers.

111
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:07,806
In the experience of this board,

112
00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:10,141
dying people
are rarely so productive.

113
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:11,776
Nevertheless, we're dying.

114
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,678
No, we're not.

115
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,913
Yes, we are.

116
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:16,681
No, we're not.
Yes, we are.

117
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:18,116
We're not.
Yes, we are.

118
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,719
Not. Not. Not.
Bus, bus.

119
00:10:20,721 --> 00:10:22,120
May the party-party
bug.

120
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,022
I'll do this one.

121
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:32,397
You're not dying.

122
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,898
Although, in a way,

123
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,768
from the moment of birth,
we all begin to die.

124
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:39,471
Call it divinely planned
obsolescence.

125
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:43,441
Soon or late, beggar or king,
death is the end of all things.

126
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:46,811
Why, life might be
seen as a virus

127
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:49,280
infecting the perfect
organism of death.

128
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:52,684
That's enough, doctor.

129
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:54,319
It's true.

130
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:57,956
Disability request denied.
It's back to work for you.

131
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,958
However, this board recommends

132
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,627
further psychiatric evaluation.

133
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:04,929
I haven't time
for more therapists.

134
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:08,833
I hope you'll have time
for this.

135
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:14,039
Did you hear about tonight?

136
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,508
Changed. It's not 8,
it's 7:30, right?

137
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,976
Okay.
I'm going as a tiger.

138
00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:21,279
All right, Quinn.

139
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:24,983
I told you, the medics
wouldn't help. Leave it.

140
00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:27,852
It's all right. Joby's
on the job. Problem solved.

141
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,554
You're sending us home?

142
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:32,691
One thing at a time.
I can get management to see you.

143
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:34,292
He's coming to my party tonight.

144
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:36,961
Party?
I'll just give you the address.

145
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:39,664
You turn up,
and I'll do the rest.

146
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:40,999
We're afraid we can't.

147
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:43,368
What, staying in
and washing your hair?

148
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,237
We have to stay home,
wait for our call.

149
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:49,708
Look, do you want
my help or not?

150
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:52,977
We fear parties.

151
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:56,381
Never quite know where to stand.

152
00:11:58,652 --> 00:12:02,754
You kill me, you lunatic.
You don't know where to stand?

153
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:04,155
You gotta love it.

154
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:07,459
I'll see you tonight, Quinn.

155
00:12:07,461 --> 00:12:09,394
It's qohen.

156
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:38,223
Hey! Quinn!

157
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:41,993
That's the wrong way.
This way. This way.

158
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:45,363
Party. Party.
Come in. Come in.

159
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:48,066
Yeah.

160
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:52,937
This is the main room,
everything's free in there.

161
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:55,507
Hello, Barbara. How you doing,
darling? All right?

162
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:57,542
You... she can't...

163
00:12:57,544 --> 00:12:59,210
You see what this is?

164
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:01,346
You see this?
Know what it is?

165
00:13:01,348 --> 00:13:04,282
That's marble.
It's real marble.

166
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:07,218
This place is covered in it.
It's my Uncle's.

167
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,354
It was my Uncle's.
He lost everything

168
00:13:09,356 --> 00:13:11,189
in the sit on my Facebook crash.

169
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:13,591
The removal men
are coming tomorrow.

170
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:15,627
But tonight, it's ours,

171
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:18,596
so you party.

172
00:13:18,598 --> 00:13:21,099
Heh. Whoo!

173
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:24,702
Is management here?
Mm! Whoa, whoa, whoa.

174
00:13:24,704 --> 00:13:27,672
Keep it down. You don't wanna
start a rumor, right?

175
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:29,941
Where's management?
Shh.

176
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:34,479
On his way. When he gets here,
I'll let you know.

177
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:37,882
In the meantime, lighten up.
Have some fun for a change.

178
00:13:37,884 --> 00:13:40,752
And mingle, Quinn.
Mingle, all right?

179
00:13:40,754 --> 00:13:42,287
It's qohen.

180
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:44,355
Yeah, yeah, of course.

181
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:56,935
Hi.

182
00:13:56,937 --> 00:13:58,870
I love the look.

183
00:13:58,872 --> 00:14:02,140
Final evolution
or re-product?

184
00:14:02,142 --> 00:14:06,678
Maximum brain, minimalist body.

185
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,613
Excuse us.

186
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,500
Sit.

187
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:08,473
Now, what seems to be
the problem?

188
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:11,743
We simply want to go home.

189
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,947
Home?

190
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:21,619
We can tell that you are a man
who values his solitude,

191
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:24,923
and we too are
better off left alone.

192
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:28,826
We fail to see the logic
in wasting time commuting

193
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:31,763
to a cubicle where
we work independently

194
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:34,832
amid other workers
similarly cubicled.

195
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:41,172
We could easily double
the output there at home.

196
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:47,345
And our chief concern
is that we might miss our call.

197
00:15:47,347 --> 00:15:52,183
You see, we've been waiting
for a call all our life now.

198
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:55,653
And, well, we've...

199
00:15:55,655 --> 00:15:59,157
The nature or the origin of our
call remains a mystery to us.

200
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:02,160
We can't help but hope
that it will provide us

201
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:06,097
with a purpose
we've long lived without.

202
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:13,538
You're quite insane,
Mr. leth.

203
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:21,245
We're sorry to have
disturbed you.

204
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:27,852
Drink?
No.

205
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:31,990
Drink?

206
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:35,827
Oh! Whoa, Quinn,
you chrome dome bastard.

207
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:38,463
Where are you sneaking off?
Sneaky, sneaky.

208
00:16:38,465 --> 00:16:40,865
Give me that coat.
We've seen him.

209
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:43,368
Who?
Management.

210
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:46,904
Would you stop?
Management parties incognito.

211
00:16:46,906 --> 00:16:50,074
No, this isn't what he...
you're blowing his cover.

212
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:51,776
We really must go home now.

213
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:54,278
No. Look, I'll sort
something out.

214
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,080
I'll get you
a proper meeting with him.

215
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:59,083
There's no way you're going
without something to eat.

216
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:00,418
It's qohen.

217
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,787
We've had, apparently,
our meeting.

218
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:05,523
Just one.
Our diet dictates against

219
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:07,525
any foods
with perceptible flavor.

220
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:10,128
All right, all right,
all right. Eat, eat, eat.

221
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:12,196
That's an order.

222
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,199
Plenty of eats.

223
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,904
Plenty more.

224
00:17:19,906 --> 00:17:23,241
Plenty for everybody.

225
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:25,843
All right.
Hey. Hold. Hold it. Yeah.

226
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:33,818
What is the meaning
of life, Mr. leth?

227
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:38,589
Ah. So close to its end
and still no answers.

228
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:43,194
I have a special project for you

229
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:45,496
that could prove
to be mutually beneficial.

230
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:50,835
There's not a lot of time,
not much time at all.

231
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,830
Whoo!

232
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:27,905
Okay.

233
00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:38,015
You alive in there?

234
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:44,222
Whoo.
Are you okay?

235
00:18:44,224 --> 00:18:45,957
Yeah?

236
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:53,564
Yeah.

237
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:57,768
Excuse us.

238
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:01,539
Care to join me?
Excuse us?

239
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:06,677
I won't be long.

240
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:31,068
So I saved your life.

241
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:33,304
So what?

242
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:37,708
Thank you.
You're welcome.

243
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,844
I'm bainsley.

244
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:42,113
And you are?

245
00:19:42,115 --> 00:19:45,249
Qohen. Q, no u.

246
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:47,285
And you work with these people?

247
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:49,854
In a manner of speaking, yeah.

248
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:54,692
What do you do?
Us? We crunch entities.

249
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:58,129
You got a mouse in your pocket?
Excuse us?

250
00:19:58,131 --> 00:19:59,997
But who's "we"?

251
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:01,966
Us. Ourselves.

252
00:20:01,968 --> 00:20:04,669
Oh, catchy.

253
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:07,438
Hey, help!

254
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:10,575
You're staring at me.

255
00:20:10,577 --> 00:20:13,377
You think my dress
is incredibly ugly?

256
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,550
Well, it's my daddy's fault.

257
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,419
He used to buy me
these incredibly

258
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:24,222
ugly clothes to keep
the boys away.

259
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:25,656
It didn't work.

260
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:28,092
Only made me wanna get naked.

261
00:20:28,094 --> 00:20:31,929
And that's no way
to keep the boys away.

262
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:33,297
Excuse us.

263
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:35,433
<i>We really must leave now.</i>

264
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:37,068
<i>No, wait.</i>

265
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,970
<i>Just wait.</i>

266
00:20:38,972 --> 00:20:40,438
<i>Wait.</i>

267
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:53,484
Did anybody ever tell you,
"be careful what you wish for"?

268
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:55,319
Excuse us?
What's all this about?

269
00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:57,588
You're going home.

270
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:09,400
Zero theorem.

271
00:21:09,402 --> 00:21:11,235
All very hush-hush.

272
00:21:11,237 --> 00:21:15,072
Management's been handpicking
talent since before I was hired.

273
00:21:15,074 --> 00:21:17,975
Nobody lasts. It's a guaranteed
burnout project.

274
00:21:17,977 --> 00:21:21,279
I worked at it for about
three weeks when I was young.

275
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:22,713
Drove me balmy.

276
00:21:22,715 --> 00:21:25,082
After zip-t,
I couldn't crunch coco pops.

277
00:21:25,084 --> 00:21:27,618
That's why management
made me a supervisor.

278
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,387
You might've noticed
I'm a few raisins

279
00:21:29,389 --> 00:21:32,323
short of a full scoop.
Ha-ha.

280
00:21:32,325 --> 00:21:35,059
That's why he chose you,
I think. Ooh.

281
00:21:35,061 --> 00:21:36,827
Nothing left to lose.

282
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:39,030
The tech boys should be
around at your place now,

283
00:21:39,032 --> 00:21:41,332
changing the locks,
setting up the standard

284
00:21:41,334 --> 00:21:43,367
at-home
work force security.

285
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:46,504
I've got my money on you, Quinn.

286
00:21:46,506 --> 00:21:49,540
You'll be proving
that theorem in no time.

287
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:51,676
What exactly will we be proving?

288
00:21:51,678 --> 00:21:53,711
That management's
getting desperate.

289
00:21:57,383 --> 00:21:58,616
Have you ever wondered

290
00:21:58,618 --> 00:22:02,853
where all the stuff
you crunch winds up?

291
00:22:02,855 --> 00:22:04,055
Voilà.

292
00:22:16,903 --> 00:22:19,236
Here. Put this on.

293
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:24,241
Come.

294
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:28,746
Neural net mancrive.

295
00:22:28,748 --> 00:22:31,916
The center of management's
entire operation.

296
00:22:31,918 --> 00:22:35,720
Smart as shit
and still learning.

297
00:22:35,722 --> 00:22:38,756
Now, be very, very quiet.

298
00:22:38,758 --> 00:22:41,759
We're hunting entities.

299
00:22:44,931 --> 00:22:47,064
Working hard, Bob,
or hardly working?

300
00:22:47,066 --> 00:22:48,699
Today's the same, Bob.

301
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:51,135
Don't mind me, Bob, I'm just
getting Quinn started

302
00:22:51,137 --> 00:22:52,937
on the old zipster.

303
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,575
That's a waste of time, Bob.

304
00:22:57,577 --> 00:22:59,610
I give him two weeks.

305
00:22:59,612 --> 00:23:02,613
That's Bob, summer intern.

306
00:23:02,615 --> 00:23:03,948
Why does he call you Bob?

307
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:06,384
Oh, Bob calls everybody Bob.

308
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:08,819
He says it's a waste of brain
cells remembering names.

309
00:23:08,821 --> 00:23:10,488
Typical hardware specialist.

310
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:12,056
Isn't he rather young for that?

311
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:15,259
No, that kid could program
before he could walk.

312
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:28,005
Right. Now,
here's your software.

313
00:23:29,374 --> 00:23:32,476
Management will send you
new data downloads every week.

314
00:23:32,478 --> 00:23:34,945
How long is this project
going to take?

315
00:23:34,947 --> 00:23:38,282
Don't know.
It could take forever.

316
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:41,118
When I was a little tyke,

317
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,721
everybody thought neutrinos
had no mass.

318
00:23:43,723 --> 00:23:45,856
Somebody discovered
they do have mass.

319
00:23:45,858 --> 00:23:49,059
Tiny little bit of mass,
but mass is mass, right?

320
00:23:49,061 --> 00:23:51,128
It's got to add up to something.

321
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:55,065
That stuff used to
keep me awake at night.

322
00:23:55,067 --> 00:23:57,968
Not that you should worry.
Everything's under control.

323
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:00,237
You got everything you wanted.

324
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:03,073
Ever get a feeling the world's
giggling behind your back?

325
00:24:03,075 --> 00:24:06,877
That everybody in the universe
is in on some cosmic joke?

326
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:09,246
Everybody but you. The only
reason you're not laughing is

327
00:24:09,248 --> 00:24:11,982
you're the punchline. You ever
get that feeling, Quinn?

328
00:24:11,984 --> 00:24:13,217
It's qohen.

329
00:24:13,219 --> 00:24:15,052
Working hard, Bob,
or hardly working?

330
00:24:15,054 --> 00:24:17,388
Well, it pays the same, Bob.

331
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:19,690
Pays the same.

332
00:24:26,332 --> 00:24:31,569

<i>Zero must equal 100 percent.</i>

<i>Zero must equal 100 percent.</i>

355
00:27:42,028 --> 00:27:45,863
<i>Zero must equal 100 percent.</i>

356
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:55,239
<i>You seem tense, qohen.</i>

357
00:27:57,342 --> 00:28:00,544
<i>Let's return to the subject</i>
<i>of your fears.</i>

358
00:28:00,546 --> 00:28:04,048
<i>In past sessions,</i>
<i>you have reported</i>

359
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:06,116
<i>a fear of death, a fear of life,</i>

360
00:28:06,118 --> 00:28:08,419
<i>a fear of open spaces,</i>
<i>closed places,</i>

361
00:28:08,421 --> 00:28:11,055
<i>a fear of people,</i>
<i>a fear of being alone,</i>

362
00:28:11,057 --> 00:28:13,223
<i>a fear of missing certain...</i>
no.

363
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:17,194
We fear a great many things,
but we fear nothing most of all.

364
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:19,596
<i>Please go on.</i>
In what manner?

365
00:28:19,598 --> 00:28:22,566
<i>Are you trying to be difficult?</i>
Not at all.

366
00:28:22,568 --> 00:28:27,705
It seems we're capable of being
difficult without trying.

367
00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:29,339
<i>We've spoken about your fears.</i>

368
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:32,076
<i>Let's speak about your joys.</i>

369
00:28:32,078 --> 00:28:34,778
At present, there's
very little we can think of

370
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,146
that brings us joy.

371
00:28:36,148 --> 00:28:39,483
<i>What brought you joy</i>
<i>in the past?</i>

372
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:45,622
We recall enjoying food once.
<i>What was your favorite food?</i>

373
00:28:45,624 --> 00:28:48,125
That, we can't recall.

374
00:28:48,127 --> 00:28:52,930
At present, we feel no joy.

375
00:28:52,932 --> 00:28:55,532
<i>What do you feel?</i>

376
00:28:55,534 --> 00:28:57,334
Nothing.

377
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,171
<i>You're a tough nut</i>
<i>to crack, qohen.</i>

378
00:29:01,173 --> 00:29:02,973
<i>And, of course,</i>
<i>I don't mean "nut"</i>

379
00:29:02,975 --> 00:29:04,908
<i>in the pejorative sense.</i>

380
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:09,580
<i>Let's examine...</i>

381
00:29:09,582 --> 00:29:12,983
<i>- Hello, qohen leth.</i>
<i>- This is a courtesy call.</i>

382
00:29:12,985 --> 00:29:15,285
<i>Your next installment</i>
<i>of processed data</i>

383
00:29:15,287 --> 00:29:17,121
<i>is due for upload in one hour.</i>

384
00:29:17,123 --> 00:29:18,622
What?
<i>If the target timetable</i>

385
00:29:18,624 --> 00:29:21,759
<i>is attainable, press one.</i>
<i>If not, ent...</i>

386
00:29:21,761 --> 00:29:25,729
<i>please enter number of minutes</i>
<i>needed for target overruns.</i>

387
00:29:25,731 --> 00:29:28,999
<i>One moment, please.</i>
<i>Management have authorized</i>

388
00:29:29,001 --> 00:29:31,101
<i>a 60-minute overrun.</i>
No, that...

389
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:34,171
<i>goodbye, Mr. leth.</i>
That's nothing... no.

390
00:29:34,173 --> 00:29:37,007
<i>We can finish this session</i>
<i>another time, qohen.</i>

391
00:29:37,009 --> 00:29:38,675
<i>Get back to work.</i>
We'll never finish.

392
00:29:38,677 --> 00:29:42,212
These entities refuse
to remain crunched.

393
00:29:42,214 --> 00:29:44,882
Each has its own meaning,
but that changes

394
00:29:44,884 --> 00:29:47,084
depending on the following.
<i>Qohen.</i>

395
00:29:47,086 --> 00:29:49,119
Which then changes <i>deep breath.</i>

396
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:53,023
Depending on the meaning of...
<i>deep breath in and out.</i>

397
00:29:53,025 --> 00:29:55,526
<i>Deep breath in...</i>

398
00:29:55,528 --> 00:29:58,695
<i>And out.</i>
All we want is our call.

399
00:29:58,697 --> 00:30:00,564
<i>Yes, your call.</i>

400
00:30:00,566 --> 00:30:03,467
<i>We'll complete this session</i>
<i>another time.</i>

401
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:13,710
<i>- Hello, qohen leth.</i>
<i>- This is a courtesy call.</i>

<i>Your next installment</i>

403
00:30:16,448 --> 00:30:19,283
<i>hello, qohen leth.</i>
<i>This is a courtesy call.</i>

404
00:30:19,285 --> 00:30:21,685
<i>Your next installment</i>
<i>of processed data</i>

406
00:30:23,255 --> 00:30:25,055
<i>Hello, qohen leth.</i>

407
00:30:25,057 --> 00:30:28,158
<i>Are you an entity process?</i>

408
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,994
<i>Have you tried them?</i>

409
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:33,130
<i>You should try herbs.</i>

410
00:30:33,132 --> 00:30:35,465
<i>I'm happy with herbs.</i>

411
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:37,501
<i>Way happy.</i>

412
00:30:37,503 --> 00:30:41,004
<i>They should put them in</i>
<i>the drinking water. Ha-ha-ha.</i>

413
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:44,174
<i>Black fluoride. Ha-ha-ha.</i>

414
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:45,542
Are you here alone?

415
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:51,448
We are generally
everywhere alone.

416
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:54,151
I love mystery.

417
00:30:54,153 --> 00:30:56,954
Turns me on.

418
00:30:56,956 --> 00:31:00,624
Well, you don't know me,
and I don't know you.

419
00:31:00,626 --> 00:31:01,825
No.

420
00:31:01,827 --> 00:31:03,994
I'm the neighbor.
Mm-hm.

421
00:31:03,996 --> 00:31:07,130
There's always a neighbor
at this kind of party.

422
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:12,102
Care to come to my place?

423
00:31:12,104 --> 00:31:14,404
We'd only disappoint you

424
00:31:14,406 --> 00:31:17,708
as we have countless others.

425
00:31:19,245 --> 00:31:21,979
That's the best line
I've heard all night.

426
00:31:21,981 --> 00:31:24,181
Thank you.
Mm.

427
00:31:24,183 --> 00:31:26,116
We must leave now.

428
00:31:26,118 --> 00:31:27,818
Hey, wait.

429
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,786
Wait.

430
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:33,257
Don't say no.

431
00:31:33,259 --> 00:31:36,193
Just think about it.

432
00:31:36,195 --> 00:31:37,928
If it's not now,

433
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:40,898
some other time.

434
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,766
Just have

435
00:31:42,768 --> 00:31:46,036
to call me.

436
00:31:46,038 --> 00:31:49,006
<i>- Goodbye, Mr. leth.</i>
<i>- Goodbye, Mr. leth.</i>

437
00:31:49,008 --> 00:31:52,109

Go like this.

447
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:37,921
Ha-ha-ha.

448
00:32:37,923 --> 00:32:41,224
Sideways walks the crab, and...

449
00:32:47,933 --> 00:32:50,167
Ha-ha-ha, oh!

450
00:32:56,841 --> 00:32:59,076
No. No.

451
00:33:04,882 --> 00:33:06,650
Come on.

452
00:33:10,054 --> 00:33:12,889
Yeah.

453
00:33:12,891 --> 00:33:15,092
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

454
00:33:15,094 --> 00:33:18,061
No, no, no!

And you too!

471
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:57,934
No!

472
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,561
Hello?

473
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:28,365
<i>Management says</i>
<i>you've got a problem.</i>

474
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:53,457
Quinn, you tortured little slut,

475
00:34:53,459 --> 00:34:55,425
that is.
Been a long time.

476
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:58,428
How are you?
Still dying, I see.

477
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,497
What are you doing here?
Field work.

478
00:35:00,499 --> 00:35:02,099
I love it. Gets me
out of the office,

479
00:35:02,101 --> 00:35:04,768
into a snappy uniform.
Ha, ha.

480
00:35:07,406 --> 00:35:11,274
You could use
a woman's touch, Quinn.

481
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:15,579
Eh...

482
00:35:15,581 --> 00:35:17,981
Ah. Management can't get
through to you.

483
00:35:17,983 --> 00:35:19,282
What's the story?

484
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:22,185
At present, we have difficulty

485
00:35:22,187 --> 00:35:24,321
maintaining our upload schedule.

486
00:35:24,323 --> 00:35:27,657
The entities are
behaving very strangely.

487
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:29,493
Yeah.

488
00:35:29,495 --> 00:35:33,063
Personnel meltdown.
I've seen plenty of it.

489
00:35:33,065 --> 00:35:35,398
I'd pull you off the pitch,

490
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,301
but management wants
to give you another chance.

491
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:40,904
Don't ask me why.

492
00:35:40,906 --> 00:35:42,639
Ooh.

493
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:45,142
Phone trouble, was it?

494
00:35:45,144 --> 00:35:48,178
Tried to fix it yourself,
did you?

495
00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:54,684
Wrong tool for the job.

496
00:35:54,686 --> 00:35:58,388
Ball-peen's more for hammering
out dents in sheet metal,

497
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:00,490
not for close tolerance
phone repair.

498
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:07,097
It's all about
connections, Quinn.

499
00:36:07,099 --> 00:36:11,468
Wires, wireless,

500
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:14,738
weaving a world wide web.

501
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:17,073
Can't get anything
if you're disconnected.

502
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:22,479
Voilà.

503
00:36:22,481 --> 00:36:24,314
Tell you what,

504
00:36:24,316 --> 00:36:25,882
this manual work's
giving me a thirst.

505
00:36:25,884 --> 00:36:28,885
You've not got a beer
for a working man, have you?

506
00:36:28,887 --> 00:36:30,153
We have tap water.

507
00:36:30,155 --> 00:36:31,922
Yum-yum.

508
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:39,095
Thank you.

509
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:47,470
I miss you, Quinn.

510
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:51,474
Supervisors don't make
many friends.

511
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:57,047
You consider us a friend?
Yeah, of course I do.

512
00:36:57,049 --> 00:36:58,882
Of course I do.

513
00:37:00,117 --> 00:37:03,119
So, what's the real problem?

514
00:37:05,656 --> 00:37:08,525
The zero theorem is unprovable.

515
00:37:10,095 --> 00:37:12,062
<i>We still haven't received</i>
<i>our phone call.</i>

516
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:14,431
<i>You don't trust management.</i>

517
00:37:14,433 --> 00:37:15,799
<i>Nothing adds up.</i>

518
00:37:15,801 --> 00:37:17,534
<i>No, you got it backwards.</i>

519
00:37:17,536 --> 00:37:20,103
Everything adds up
to nothing, that's the point.

520
00:37:20,105 --> 00:37:21,304
What's the point?
Exactly.

521
00:37:21,306 --> 00:37:23,173
What's the point of anything?

522
00:37:23,175 --> 00:37:26,710
You've got a case of
the zero theorem heebie-jeebies.

523
00:37:26,712 --> 00:37:29,613
Don't you think working
sucked the soul out of me?

524
00:37:29,615 --> 00:37:31,481
Bet your big bald buns, it did.

525
00:37:31,483 --> 00:37:33,383
I was nowhere near
where you are.

526
00:37:33,385 --> 00:37:34,818
You're knocking
on the door, Quinn.

527
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:37,354
No wonder you're stressed.

528
00:37:37,356 --> 00:37:40,123
Sit down.
Sit down.

529
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:45,629
Do you really have
no idea what you're doing?

530
00:37:47,832 --> 00:37:50,567
We don't care.
All we care about is our call.

531
00:37:50,569 --> 00:37:52,435
Could you inform management

532
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:54,037
we want our call
and we want it now?

533
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:56,806
Yes, yes, yes, God,
talk about tunnel vision.

534
00:37:56,808 --> 00:37:59,743
You'll get your call.
You're a bundle of nerves.

535
00:37:59,745 --> 00:38:01,845
You can't work like this.

536
00:38:01,847 --> 00:38:03,580
You're not gonna get
that call of yours

537
00:38:03,582 --> 00:38:07,017
all wound up tight like this.

538
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:11,621
I've got a friend
who might be able to help.

539
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:13,290
You said you didn't
have any friends.

540
00:38:13,292 --> 00:38:14,991
Ouch, Quinn, ouch.

541
00:38:14,993 --> 00:38:16,893
That hurts.

542
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:20,463
It's qohen.

543
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:24,000
Q, no u, o-h-e-n.

544
00:38:24,002 --> 00:38:26,436
All right. No need
to spell it out, man.

545
00:38:26,438 --> 00:38:28,171
I've got the picture.

546
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,408
Let joby handle it.

547
00:38:47,459 --> 00:38:48,658
Yes?

548
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,126
<i>Mr. leth?</i>

549
00:38:50,128 --> 00:38:52,162
<i>Qohen leth?</i>

550
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:08,878
Surprise.

551
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,681
Bainsley.

552
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:14,651
I waited.
You never called.

553
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:22,525
Oh, you poor thing.

554
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:25,528
Joby's right, you need me.

555
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:30,066
You're Mr. joby's
friend?

556
00:39:30,068 --> 00:39:32,902
Well, joby doesn't
have any friends.

557
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:37,640
I feel so, so holy,

558
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:42,846
going to the chapel of love.

559
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:45,315
We prefer not to be touched.

560
00:39:45,317 --> 00:39:48,785
The rent must be outrageous.

561
00:39:48,787 --> 00:39:51,688
Actually, we own the building.

562
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:54,657
We bought it from
an insurance company

563
00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:57,727
some years ago. There'd been
extensive fire damage.

564
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:02,966
The previous occupants
were an order of monastic monks

565
00:40:02,968 --> 00:40:08,004
who've sworn vows of chastity...

566
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:12,342
Poverty and silence.

567
00:40:12,344 --> 00:40:16,346
Apparently, no one broke
the silence to yell fire.

568
00:40:17,983 --> 00:40:19,983
And what do we have here?

569
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:25,722
Oh. Ha-ha-ha.
Goodness me.

570
00:40:25,724 --> 00:40:29,726
What other surprises
do you have for me?

571
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:32,228
That was a gift from...

572
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:37,066
You have...

573
00:40:38,302 --> 00:40:39,903
The most

574
00:40:39,905 --> 00:40:44,908
intriguing bone structure.

575
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:46,443
So polished.

576
00:40:46,445 --> 00:40:49,746
So, so pure.

577
00:40:51,148 --> 00:40:53,783
Ahh. So pure.

578
00:40:55,753 --> 00:40:57,687
Hey, a mighty big

579
00:40:57,689 --> 00:40:59,989
hard drive you got here.

580
00:40:59,991 --> 00:41:03,693
What work do you do exactly?

581
00:41:03,695 --> 00:41:06,696
Well, I shoot trouble.

582
00:41:06,698 --> 00:41:09,132
Mr. joby seemed to think
that you might

583
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:10,767
help us get our call?
Yeah.

584
00:41:10,769 --> 00:41:14,838
Yeah, he mentioned
the call thing.

585
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,707
You're staring at me.

586
00:41:17,709 --> 00:41:20,176
We're terribly sorry.

587
00:41:20,178 --> 00:41:21,578
Ahh!

588
00:41:23,215 --> 00:41:25,682
I just broke a nail.

589
00:41:26,717 --> 00:41:28,218
On your big, fat,

590
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:31,187
stupid keyboard.
We'll get our first aid kit.

591
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,723
Would you please just

592
00:41:33,725 --> 00:41:36,459
kiss it?
Excuse us?

593
00:41:36,461 --> 00:41:38,127
Whenever I hurt myself,

594
00:41:38,129 --> 00:41:40,296
my daddy would kiss it

595
00:41:40,298 --> 00:41:42,131
and make it all better.

596
00:41:42,133 --> 00:41:45,969
Well, we fail to see how...
please.

597
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:58,848
You call that a kiss?

598
00:42:10,961 --> 00:42:14,864
There.
All better?

599
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:17,100
<i>Excuse me, couldn't help</i>

600
00:42:17,102 --> 00:42:19,836
<i>noticing this young lady's</i>
<i>pathological attempts</i>

601
00:42:19,838 --> 00:42:21,971
<i>to project upon you</i>
<i>her unresolved issues</i>

602
00:42:21,973 --> 00:42:23,606
<i>of paternal abandonment.</i>

603
00:42:23,608 --> 00:42:25,608
<i>Given the significant</i>
<i>age difference</i>

604
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:27,176
<i>between the two of you...</i>

605
00:42:27,178 --> 00:42:29,045
nosy bitch.

606
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:33,016
My daddy didn't abandon me.

607
00:42:33,018 --> 00:42:34,217
He died.

608
00:42:36,186 --> 00:42:38,388
In case you're getting
the wrong idea,

609
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:42,025
I should tell you that
I don't do sexual intercourse.

610
00:42:42,027 --> 00:42:45,028
I don't care if a guy wraps
himself up like a latex mummy.

611
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:49,666
But...
but nothing is going inside me.

612
00:42:49,668 --> 00:42:51,901
Way too dangerous.

613
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:58,207
I'm into tantric,
bio-telemetric interfacing now.

614
00:42:58,209 --> 00:43:00,510
It's smart and safe.

615
00:43:00,512 --> 00:43:03,880
And, God, it just feel

616
00:43:03,882 --> 00:43:07,517
so super tingly.

617
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:09,519
Got anything to eat around here?

618
00:43:09,521 --> 00:43:12,422
I'm starving my ass off.

619
00:43:14,593 --> 00:43:18,027
Ah. What a mess.

620
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:24,901
You're staring at me again.
Forgive us.

621
00:43:24,903 --> 00:43:26,469
Well, I don't mind.

622
00:43:26,471 --> 00:43:29,572
Just noticing, that's all.

623
00:43:29,574 --> 00:43:32,475
You're a pretty intense guy.

624
00:43:32,477 --> 00:43:37,413
So here you are, qohen,

625
00:43:37,415 --> 00:43:40,583
locked up all alone

626
00:43:40,585 --> 00:43:42,919
and waiting for...

627
00:43:42,921 --> 00:43:46,656
For what?
For a phone call?

628
00:43:46,658 --> 00:43:49,325
So tell me, what's that
all about? Hmm?

629
00:43:49,327 --> 00:43:52,261
No, we've grown weary
explaining ourselves.

630
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:57,066
But how am I supposed to help

631
00:43:57,068 --> 00:43:59,769
if you don't
tell me? Hmm?

632
00:44:01,672 --> 00:44:04,507
Please.
Please.

633
00:44:13,417 --> 00:44:17,420
So come on.
How did it all start?

634
00:44:20,891 --> 00:44:22,992
We're not quite certain.

635
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:29,966
We must confess that

636
00:44:29,968 --> 00:44:32,368
for good or ill,

637
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:36,439
that we always wanted
to feel different,

638
00:44:36,441 --> 00:44:38,141
unique.

639
00:44:39,643 --> 00:44:41,944
Objective analysis,
however, concluded

640
00:44:41,946 --> 00:44:45,381
that we're as inconsequential
as anyone else.

641
00:44:45,383 --> 00:44:48,918
We are but one in many

642
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:52,121
single worker bee
in a vast swarm,

643
00:44:52,123 --> 00:44:57,460
subject to the same imperatives
as billions of others.

644
00:44:57,462 --> 00:44:59,629
We dulled our discontent

645
00:44:59,631 --> 00:45:03,366
in alcohol, drugs, sex.

646
00:45:05,903 --> 00:45:08,938
And then it happened.

647
00:45:10,908 --> 00:45:12,942
One night...

648
00:45:14,713 --> 00:45:17,947
Oh, a long time ago,

649
00:45:17,949 --> 00:45:21,951
we were awakened
by the phone ringing.

650
00:45:21,953 --> 00:45:23,286
We picked it up.

651
00:45:23,288 --> 00:45:27,356
A voice on the other end said:

652
00:45:27,358 --> 00:45:30,727
"Qohen leth."

653
00:45:32,997 --> 00:45:35,231
But before we could respond,

654
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:38,768
we felt this great
yawning maul of power

655
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:41,304
opening through the phone line.

656
00:45:41,306 --> 00:45:43,439
We felt a sudden rush of joy

657
00:45:43,441 --> 00:45:46,509
unlike anything
we've ever felt before.

658
00:45:46,511 --> 00:45:50,413
Then we knew quite clearly
that we only had to answer "yes"

659
00:45:50,415 --> 00:45:54,517
and the voice would tell us
the meaning of our life.

660
00:45:54,519 --> 00:45:57,420
The voice would tell us

661
00:45:57,422 --> 00:45:58,654
our special calling.

662
00:45:58,656 --> 00:46:02,258
The voice would give us
a reason for being.

663
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,297
And then?

664
00:46:09,066 --> 00:46:11,734
And then...

665
00:46:11,736 --> 00:46:13,469
In our excitement,

666
00:46:13,471 --> 00:46:17,206
we dropped the receiver,
disconnecting ourselves.

667
00:46:21,645 --> 00:46:25,782
You've been waiting
for a call-back ever since?

668
00:46:25,784 --> 00:46:28,284
What other reason is there
to pick up the phone?

669
00:46:28,286 --> 00:46:31,020
Well, communication for one.

670
00:46:31,022 --> 00:46:32,989
It's mostly unnecessary.

671
00:46:32,991 --> 00:46:35,324
But that's what we're doing now.

672
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:39,061
In a manner of speaking.

673
00:46:41,064 --> 00:46:43,699
So all this time,
you've been waiting

674
00:46:43,701 --> 00:46:46,035
for a mysterious voice

675
00:46:46,037 --> 00:46:49,372
to tell you what to do
with your life.

676
00:46:50,874 --> 00:46:52,141
Wow.

677
00:46:52,143 --> 00:46:55,444
Probably just
a cold call anyway.

678
00:46:55,446 --> 00:46:57,079
If you hadn't dropped the phone,

679
00:46:57,081 --> 00:47:00,016
you'd own a time share
in majorca.

680
00:47:00,018 --> 00:47:02,318
Big deal. Heh.

681
00:47:09,226 --> 00:47:12,395
Do you really believe
everything you've just told me?

682
00:47:12,397 --> 00:47:13,963
Yes.

683
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:18,034
Okay.

684
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:21,237
Okay.

685
00:47:22,706 --> 00:47:25,141
I can help you.

686
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:28,377
But don't go away.

687
00:47:28,379 --> 00:47:32,114
<i>And I'll be back in</i>
<i>a tail shake, all right?</i>

688
00:47:45,996 --> 00:47:48,397
- Bainsley?
<i>- Bob, buzz me in.</i>

689
00:47:48,932 --> 00:47:50,299
Bob who?

690
00:47:50,301 --> 00:47:52,068
<i>Bob, I have to take</i>
<i>a wicked pee.</i>

691
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:54,036
<i>Buzz me in, Scotty.</i>

692
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:55,571
Our name isn't Scotty.

693
00:47:55,573 --> 00:47:56,906
<i>I know that, Bob.</i>

694
00:47:56,908 --> 00:47:58,474
Our name isn't Bob.
<i>Come on.</i>

695
00:47:58,476 --> 00:48:01,744
<i>I'm doing the tinkle dance here.</i>

696
00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:15,625
Where's your bathroom?

697
00:48:15,627 --> 00:48:17,560
Where's your bathroom?

698
00:48:17,562 --> 00:48:19,262
It's here.

699
00:48:37,147 --> 00:48:38,347
How did you get in?

700
00:48:38,349 --> 00:48:40,750
Fucking magic.

701
00:48:40,752 --> 00:48:43,619
Excuse my French.

702
00:48:43,621 --> 00:48:46,822
Holy shit, man, I think
I did some renal damage

703
00:48:46,824 --> 00:48:48,424
holding it in that long.

704
00:48:48,426 --> 00:48:50,192
Slim got stuck in traffic.

705
00:48:50,194 --> 00:48:51,661
Chubs drove, Bob.

706
00:48:51,663 --> 00:48:53,763
Fast as I could.

707
00:49:00,037 --> 00:49:01,270
Sign here.
What?

708
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:02,838
A receipt of delivery.

709
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:06,509
We're delivering...
Bob. Assigned to help you. Sign.

710
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:11,180
Brilliant. We'll pick him up
in exactly four hours.

711
00:49:11,182 --> 00:49:13,316
Don't lose him.
Don't lose him.

712
00:49:14,651 --> 00:49:16,886
I wouldn't mess with
the clones if I were you.

713
00:49:16,888 --> 00:49:18,955
They look harmless,
but they'd just as soon

714
00:49:18,957 --> 00:49:20,523
flame you to death.

715
00:49:21,725 --> 00:49:26,595
This is a... this is
a creepy place you got here.

716
00:49:26,597 --> 00:49:28,331
Are you okay?

717
00:49:28,333 --> 00:49:30,399
Actually, we're dying.

718
00:49:30,401 --> 00:49:32,368
For me to be with, I mean.

719
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:33,769
You're a scary looking guy, Bob.

720
00:49:33,771 --> 00:49:36,272
Would you please stop
calling us Bob?

721
00:49:36,274 --> 00:49:39,008
What do you want me to call you?
Mr. leth.

722
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:40,209
Leth?

723
00:49:40,211 --> 00:49:43,980
No, no, it's too wormy.

724
00:49:43,982 --> 00:49:46,949
Qohen, then.
Q, no u, o-h-e-n.

725
00:49:46,951 --> 00:49:48,617
Gotta buy another vowel.

726
00:49:48,619 --> 00:49:50,853
Q.
Or q.

727
00:49:50,855 --> 00:49:52,688
Yeah, q will do.

728
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:54,256
Q is you.

729
00:49:54,258 --> 00:49:56,125
Happy now?

730
00:49:56,127 --> 00:49:57,593
Why are you here?

731
00:49:57,595 --> 00:50:00,262
Old man assigned me
to get you up and running again.

732
00:50:00,264 --> 00:50:01,797
The old man?
The boss.

733
00:50:01,799 --> 00:50:03,899
The darth vader
of microprocessing.

734
00:50:03,901 --> 00:50:06,936
The guy I call daddy dearest,
also known as management.

735
00:50:06,938 --> 00:50:09,939
You're management's son?
The one and only.

736
00:50:09,941 --> 00:50:11,273
Heir to his dark throne,

737
00:50:11,275 --> 00:50:14,276
stuck working this summer job.

738
00:50:14,278 --> 00:50:16,612
Order us a pizza.
I missed breakfast,

739
00:50:16,614 --> 00:50:18,681
and this is gonna take a while.

740
00:50:18,683 --> 00:50:21,917
We have oatmeal if you chose...
if I wanted to vomit.

741
00:50:21,919 --> 00:50:25,421
Order the pie, double cheese.

742
00:50:27,891 --> 00:50:30,159
Fuck. Fuck.

743
00:50:30,161 --> 00:50:32,361
How can you work like this?

744
00:50:32,363 --> 00:50:35,798
Oh, it's fucking ridiculous.

745
00:50:38,602 --> 00:50:40,703
Fuck. Fuck.

746
00:50:40,705 --> 00:50:43,873
<i>I can't stand people</i>
<i>gawking at me.</i>

747
00:50:43,875 --> 00:50:46,208
<i>Dad, dad.</i>

748
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:47,676
<i>Bob's on the job.</i>

749
00:50:50,481 --> 00:50:51,847
That's better.

750
00:50:51,849 --> 00:50:54,116
Who can work...?
Who can work with him

751
00:50:54,118 --> 00:50:56,552
looking over your shoulder?

752
00:50:56,554 --> 00:50:58,454
We have nothing to hide.

753
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:01,524
The point is moot
since we're not

754
00:51:01,526 --> 00:51:02,858
working for him any longer.

755
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:06,228
Yeah, right, keep
telling yourself that.

756
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:08,164
What do you mean?

757
00:51:08,166 --> 00:51:11,934
The old man is not
done with you yet.

758
00:51:11,936 --> 00:51:13,469
But we're done with him.

759
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:17,373
Like those preceding us,
we have burnt out.

760
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:19,542
We have decided to quit.
Smart move.

761
00:51:19,544 --> 00:51:22,445
Too bad you can't.
What do you mean? Mr. joby...

762
00:51:22,447 --> 00:51:25,448
joby will tell you whatever
the old man wants him to.

763
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:28,117
You're a tool.
The old man uses everybody.

764
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:29,885
That yummy night nurse chick?

765
00:51:29,887 --> 00:51:31,620
Bainsley?
Tool.

766
00:51:31,622 --> 00:51:33,589
No.

767
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:36,392
She promised to help us.
We are waiting for her.

768
00:51:36,394 --> 00:51:38,327
Wait all you want.
She's not gonna be back.

769
00:51:38,329 --> 00:51:39,862
Your call girl,

770
00:51:39,864 --> 00:51:41,964
she was paid by the hour.

771
00:51:41,966 --> 00:51:43,966
We don't believe you.

772
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:47,770
So,

773
00:51:47,772 --> 00:51:50,339
what do you think?

774
00:51:50,341 --> 00:51:53,409
This thing is years ahead
of the competition.

775
00:51:53,411 --> 00:51:56,245
It works on nerve endings,
of course but it's also

776
00:51:56,247 --> 00:51:59,014
synced directly
to the brain synapses.

777
00:51:59,016 --> 00:52:02,084
And joby said it was
one of your projects.

778
00:52:02,086 --> 00:52:04,520
We can't imagine.

779
00:52:04,522 --> 00:52:07,056
We never thought of our project

780
00:52:07,058 --> 00:52:09,158
actually having any purpose.

781
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:11,327
Top secret.

782
00:52:11,329 --> 00:52:14,563
I'm the cyberspace test pilot.

783
00:52:14,565 --> 00:52:17,399
But first, you have
to do something for me.

784
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:24,473
Voilà.

785
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:27,443
And one size fits all.

786
00:52:27,445 --> 00:52:29,678
Isn't it dangerous?
Oh.

787
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:33,649
Depends on your idea of danger.

788
00:52:36,753 --> 00:52:39,421
Just trust me.
Suit up, plug in,

789
00:52:39,423 --> 00:52:42,925
and click on
my website at midnight.

790
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,834
You're going out like that?

791
00:52:51,836 --> 00:52:55,838
They can look,
but they can't touch.

792
00:52:58,108 --> 00:52:59,942
And don't be late.

793
00:53:01,745 --> 00:53:03,779
I can't wait.

794
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:11,120
<i>So here's the deal, q, straight</i>
<i>from the old man himself.</i>

795
00:53:11,122 --> 00:53:13,989
You go back to work
on this nasty zippity-t...

796
00:53:13,991 --> 00:53:17,359
we're no longer interested.
And in return

797
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:19,428
I get you your call.

798
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:22,364
You? You will
get us our call?

799
00:53:22,366 --> 00:53:24,567
Yes, I will get you your call.

800
00:53:24,569 --> 00:53:26,602
You're not the only
genius around here.

801
00:53:26,604 --> 00:53:29,872
I'm downloading your shrink-rom
files even as we speak.

802
00:53:29,874 --> 00:53:33,776
Those sessions are private.
Sure they are.

803
00:53:36,147 --> 00:53:40,049
Pizza! Pizza!

804
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:44,787
Pizza.

805
00:53:44,789 --> 00:53:46,655
Ooh.

806
00:53:48,091 --> 00:53:50,326
Nice.

807
00:53:50,328 --> 00:53:52,127
That's nice.

808
00:53:53,997 --> 00:53:57,266
Uh... where do I put it?

809
00:53:57,268 --> 00:53:58,867
Hmm.

810
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,840
Not just a pizza.

811
00:54:06,042 --> 00:54:08,244
So...

812
00:54:08,246 --> 00:54:09,778
Cash or charge?

813
00:54:11,715 --> 00:54:13,916
Hey.

814
00:54:13,918 --> 00:54:15,117
Thank you.

815
00:54:21,224 --> 00:54:22,491
What are you staring at?

816
00:54:22,493 --> 00:54:24,760
Sorry. Shit.
Nothing.

817
00:54:24,762 --> 00:54:28,464
Uh, um... sorry.
Oops. Heh-heh.

818
00:54:28,466 --> 00:54:30,032
Wrong answer.

819
00:54:30,034 --> 00:54:31,600
Thank you.

820
00:54:34,904 --> 00:54:36,105
Hey.

821
00:54:39,242 --> 00:54:41,043
Thank you.

822
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:44,813
Ahh!

823
00:54:44,815 --> 00:54:46,982
Holy shit.

824
00:54:46,984 --> 00:54:49,685
Oh, I think I got this
hormonal paradigm shift

825
00:54:49,687 --> 00:54:51,487
going on right now.

826
00:54:51,489 --> 00:54:53,122
Was she looking at me funny?

827
00:54:53,124 --> 00:54:55,791
We've grown accustomed
to people looking at us funny.

828
00:54:55,793 --> 00:54:57,793
Yeah, but you are funny looking.

829
00:54:57,795 --> 00:55:00,829
<i>♫ Not just a pizza, yum, yum ♫</i>

830
00:55:01,598 --> 00:55:04,300
all right, I gotta run.

831
00:55:04,302 --> 00:55:06,869
You can have the rest.

832
00:55:06,871 --> 00:55:10,039
Our diet precludes pizza.

833
00:55:10,041 --> 00:55:12,174
All right, well, save it.

834
00:55:12,176 --> 00:55:15,711
I'll study your files,
be back first thing tomorrow.

835
00:55:21,719 --> 00:55:24,153
You're late.
I'm right on time, Bob.

836
00:55:24,155 --> 00:55:27,189
No excuses. Don't let this
happen again.

837
00:55:27,191 --> 00:55:29,658
I'll be back, q.
You can trust me. Let's go.

838
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:32,528
Why would we trust you?
You trusted everybody else.

839
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:35,331
Might as well trust me.
Lose the "we" thing.

840
00:55:35,333 --> 00:55:37,132
I can't work with it.
Too annoying.

841
00:55:37,134 --> 00:55:39,201
Just ask the doc
if you don't believe me.

842
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:58,921
One size does not fit all.

843
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:34,990
<i>Hey.</i>

844
00:56:34,992 --> 00:56:37,893
<i>♫ When you were here before ♫</i>

845
00:56:39,195 --> 00:56:42,831
<i>♫ couldn't look you in the eye ♫</i>

846
00:56:44,667 --> 00:56:47,536
<i>♫ you're just like an angel ♫♫</i>

847
00:57:01,684 --> 00:57:03,552
Like it?

848
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:09,658
I made it just for you.

849
00:57:13,062 --> 00:57:15,063
The hair.

850
00:57:15,065 --> 00:57:17,132
Something special

851
00:57:17,134 --> 00:57:19,802
for a special guy.
Heh, heh, heh.

852
00:57:19,804 --> 00:57:23,572
We're not at all sure
it's quite us.

853
00:57:23,574 --> 00:57:26,241
Don't be silly.

854
00:57:26,243 --> 00:57:28,010
We no longer drink.

855
00:57:28,012 --> 00:57:30,712
But you can do
anything you want here.

856
00:57:30,714 --> 00:57:33,549
You can drink
and never get drunk.

857
00:57:33,551 --> 00:57:36,151
And you can eat
and never get fat.

858
00:57:36,153 --> 00:57:39,087
Let's forget all about
hammering out

859
00:57:39,089 --> 00:57:42,324
dents in sheet metal.
Hoo!

860
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:50,032
Mm.

861
00:57:53,736 --> 00:57:56,004
Huh.
Hm.

862
00:58:00,743 --> 00:58:04,146
Good?
Hm.

863
00:58:05,715 --> 00:58:08,851
Where is this place?

864
00:58:08,853 --> 00:58:10,285
All in your mind,

865
00:58:10,287 --> 00:58:12,788
from my mind.

866
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:16,492
Mm.

867
00:58:16,494 --> 00:58:18,660
Do you feel this?

868
00:58:20,296 --> 00:58:21,497
But it's not real.

869
00:58:21,499 --> 00:58:23,665
It's better than real.

870
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:26,935
You're in your computer.
I'm in mine.

871
00:58:26,937 --> 00:58:31,573
We're connected by memory chips
and fiber optics.

872
00:58:31,575 --> 00:58:34,409
And we're safe here.

873
00:58:34,411 --> 00:58:37,379
Just trust me.

874
00:58:39,549 --> 00:58:42,484
And let's get
this party started.

875
00:58:42,486 --> 00:58:45,320
Ah! Oh!
Ha, ha, ha.

876
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:48,323
Ooh!

877
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:01,403
Hey, come on.

878
00:59:01,405 --> 00:59:04,339
Just come.
Ha, ha, ha.

879
00:59:04,341 --> 00:59:06,208
Hey.

880
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:07,409
Go. Whoo!

881
00:59:07,411 --> 00:59:09,645
Yah!

882
00:59:14,651 --> 00:59:16,485
Here, here.

883
00:59:16,487 --> 00:59:19,388
Yeah.

884
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:23,358
Hey?

885
00:59:25,962 --> 00:59:29,364
Qohen?
Qohen?

886
01:00:26,823 --> 01:00:28,757
Who knew?

887
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:33,395
Can we die here?

888
01:00:33,397 --> 01:00:35,497
I don't think so.

889
01:00:35,499 --> 01:00:37,165
I hope.

890
01:00:37,167 --> 01:00:39,901
You're not supposed to.

891
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:57,219
Apparently, management
has assigned

892
01:00:57,221 --> 01:01:00,522
his own son to get us our call.

893
01:01:00,524 --> 01:01:03,859
We really think
that he's far too young

894
01:01:03,861 --> 01:01:05,594
to be entrusted
with the responsibility

895
01:01:05,596 --> 01:01:09,531
of such an extent that...
<i>oh, don't be such a wuss, q.</i>

896
01:01:09,533 --> 01:01:11,667
<i>Bob's a genius.</i>

897
01:01:11,669 --> 01:01:13,402
<i>Whiz kid, super brain.</i>

898
01:01:13,404 --> 01:01:16,304
<i>And if you don't know that,</i>
<i>shut up and listen.</i>

899
01:01:19,309 --> 01:01:22,144

907
01:01:41,064 --> 01:01:44,433
How did you tamper with
our shrink-rom program?

908
01:01:44,435 --> 01:01:46,134
Oh, it's easy.
She's a tool too,

909
01:01:46,136 --> 01:01:48,203
in case you didn't notice.

910
01:01:48,205 --> 01:01:49,938
Anyway, how long
have you been talking

911
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:52,340
like the queen of england?

912
01:01:52,342 --> 01:01:55,210
Longer than we can remember.
Stop. Fuck off.

913
01:01:57,613 --> 01:02:00,282
A former therapist
suggested it as a way to...

914
01:02:00,284 --> 01:02:01,450
yeah, yeah.

915
01:02:01,452 --> 01:02:04,453
As a way to closer
relate to humankind.

916
01:02:04,455 --> 01:02:07,556
Yeah, you keep it up,
I'm gonna hurl.

917
01:02:09,025 --> 01:02:11,960
Dear old dad says I can
use mancom to get you your call,

918
01:02:11,962 --> 01:02:14,763
as long as you keep
crunching, of course.

919
01:02:14,765 --> 01:02:16,965
He's all hot on you.

920
01:02:16,967 --> 01:02:19,835
We can't imagine why.

921
01:02:19,837 --> 01:02:22,471
I've been wondering
about that too.

922
01:02:22,473 --> 01:02:23,872
I figure there can

923
01:02:23,874 --> 01:02:27,476
only really be one reason.

924
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:32,914
You're the one, q.

925
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:36,518
You are the chosen one.

926
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:41,256
You're the one the oracle said

927
01:02:41,258 --> 01:02:43,525
would someday come to us.

928
01:02:49,932 --> 01:02:52,667
The old man picked you

929
01:02:52,669 --> 01:02:54,236
because you're such a work dog.

930
01:02:54,238 --> 01:02:55,971
The man says mush,
you hit the harness.

931
01:02:55,973 --> 01:02:58,607
You drag that sled
till you drop.

932
01:03:00,576 --> 01:03:03,311
You have any idea what
the zero theorem is all about?

933
01:03:05,214 --> 01:03:07,482
Never seemed important.

934
01:03:07,484 --> 01:03:10,318
Okay. Here's the poop,
the whole poop,

935
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:13,488
and nothing but the poop.

936
01:03:13,490 --> 01:03:14,589
You're trying to prove

937
01:03:14,591 --> 01:03:18,093
that the universe
is all for nothing.

938
01:03:18,095 --> 01:03:22,097
All matter,
all energy, all life,

939
01:03:22,099 --> 01:03:24,466
it's just this
one-time-only

940
01:03:24,468 --> 01:03:28,336
big bang glitch.
Expanding universe

941
01:03:28,338 --> 01:03:31,673
will eventually contract
into a super dense

942
01:03:31,675 --> 01:03:33,642
black hole.

943
01:03:33,644 --> 01:03:36,711
Gravitational forces will be
so strong that everything

944
01:03:36,713 --> 01:03:39,848
will get squeezed into
a point of zero dimension,

945
01:03:39,850 --> 01:03:42,384
and "poof" the center
disappears. No space, no time,

946
01:03:42,386 --> 01:03:44,553
no life, no afterlife, nothing.

947
01:03:44,555 --> 01:03:47,422
Nada, zilch, zip, zero.
Stop.

948
01:03:47,424 --> 01:03:51,059
How would anyone believe
such a horrible thing?

949
01:03:51,061 --> 01:03:53,895
What's so horrible?
I believe it.

950
01:03:53,897 --> 01:03:56,198
Nothing's perfect.
Nothing last forever.

951
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:59,334
It's nothing to worry about
if you really think about it.

952
01:03:59,336 --> 01:04:02,537
Your father should've assigned
the zero theorem project to you.

953
01:04:02,539 --> 01:04:06,508
Well, he's been trying to,
for as long as I can remember.

954
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:08,543
But I refused
to work on zip-t.

955
01:04:08,545 --> 01:04:12,047
Why?
Well, because I'm nobody's tool.

956
01:04:12,049 --> 01:04:13,982
All right? That's your job.

957
01:04:15,451 --> 01:04:18,987
<i>Zero must equal 100 percent.</i>

958
01:04:19,989 --> 01:04:22,624
<i>Zero must equal 100 percent.</i>

959
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:27,095
<i>Zero must equal 100 percent.</i>

960
01:04:35,104 --> 01:04:36,705

<i>Glitch fixed.</i>

976
01:05:59,588 --> 01:06:03,291
Shouldn't the sun
have set by now?

977
01:06:04,226 --> 01:06:07,195
I like to keep it this way.

978
01:06:08,497 --> 01:06:11,900
Yeah. But it's not real.
Heh.

979
01:06:11,902 --> 01:06:13,835
Who cares?

980
01:06:16,706 --> 01:06:18,940
What's the matter?

981
01:06:18,942 --> 01:06:20,342
Hm?

982
01:06:24,347 --> 01:06:27,582
Hey, want to have some fun?

983
01:06:27,584 --> 01:06:30,018
Just take us someplace else.

984
01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:31,252
Us?

985
01:06:31,254 --> 01:06:33,822
Where?
Wherever.

986
01:06:33,824 --> 01:06:37,092
A place all your own.

987
01:06:37,094 --> 01:06:39,260
All you have to do
is imagine it,

988
01:06:39,262 --> 01:06:41,863
and the vr program
will do the rest.

989
01:06:43,699 --> 01:06:46,768
Come on, take a chance.
I'm giving you the control.

990
01:06:49,805 --> 01:06:52,574
Close your eyes.

991
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:57,145
And now

992
01:06:57,147 --> 01:07:00,448
picture it in your mind.

993
01:07:00,450 --> 01:07:03,885
Take us someplace special.

994
01:07:16,632 --> 01:07:19,768
- Wow. Heh, heh.
- What an imagination.

995
01:07:21,070 --> 01:07:25,507
Ooh. Where's my bikini,
Mr. qohen leth?

996
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:35,683
What's wrong?

997
01:07:38,954 --> 01:07:42,057
Aah! Qohen, stop!

998
01:07:42,059 --> 01:07:44,192
Just close your eyes!

999
01:07:44,194 --> 01:07:45,693
We can't!
Qohen, stop!

1000
01:07:56,338 --> 01:07:59,207
Is that what's inside you?

1001
01:08:00,342 --> 01:08:03,845
How can you live
with that kind of emptiness?

1002
01:08:05,114 --> 01:08:07,949
One day at a time.

1003
01:08:07,951 --> 01:08:10,251
Tell me you love me.

1004
01:08:10,253 --> 01:08:12,420
Just tell me.

1005
01:08:13,823 --> 01:08:16,091
I can help you.

1006
01:08:16,093 --> 01:08:18,927
We can help each other.

1007
01:08:18,929 --> 01:08:20,995
Tell me you love me.

1008
01:08:20,997 --> 01:08:23,498
Just trust me, qohen.

1009
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:31,106
Oh, yes, bainsley.

1010
01:08:31,108 --> 01:08:33,541
Yes, bainsley, yes.

1011
01:08:33,543 --> 01:08:35,610
Yeah, here we can love you.

1012
01:08:37,213 --> 01:08:38,947
No more being alone.

1013
01:08:38,949 --> 01:08:41,382
No more phone calls.

1014
01:08:41,384 --> 01:08:44,652
No more projects.
No. No, don't even think that.

1015
01:08:45,955 --> 01:08:47,188
Don't say that.

1016
01:08:47,190 --> 01:08:50,191
Here, bainsley.
We can love you here.

1017
01:08:50,193 --> 01:08:53,862
We don't care about anything.
No, management won't allow it.

1018
01:08:53,864 --> 01:08:57,065
Oh, management.
He has no control over us.

1019
01:08:57,067 --> 01:09:00,335
No, don't even
think it. Qohen.

1020
01:09:00,337 --> 01:09:03,104
We can think what we want.
If management

1021
01:09:03,106 --> 01:09:05,773
doesn't like it, we quit.
No!

little entity.

01:11:26,048 --> 01:11:27,982
<i>♫ When you were here before ♫</i>

1059
01:11:27,984 --> 01:11:29,183
mm.

1060
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:32,487
<i>♫ Couldn't look you in the eye ♫</i>

1061
01:11:36,526 --> 01:11:40,595
<i>♫ You're just like an angel ♫♫</i>

1062
01:11:43,733 --> 01:11:46,668
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

1063
01:11:46,670 --> 01:11:48,603
<i>Bainsley, you are so,</i>

1064
01:11:48,605 --> 01:11:50,605
<i>mm.</i>
<i>So hot.</i>

1065
01:11:50,607 --> 01:11:52,273
<i>Isn't she, boys?</i>

1066
01:11:55,278 --> 01:11:59,414
<i>Oh, we're just being joined</i>
<i>by a new stud</i>

1067
01:11:59,416 --> 01:12:02,250
<i>for tonight's gangbang.</i>

1068
01:12:02,252 --> 01:12:05,453
<i>Bainsley, say hi</i>
<i>to Mr. qohen leth.</i>

1069
01:12:07,324 --> 01:12:09,190
<i>Hey. Hey.</i>

1070
01:12:09,192 --> 01:12:11,392
<i>Qohen.</i>

1071
01:12:23,273 --> 01:12:27,108
<i>We're connected by memory chips</i>
<i>and fiber optics.</i>

1072
01:12:28,811 --> 01:12:31,312
<i>This is my place.</i>

1073
01:12:31,314 --> 01:12:32,980
<i>We're safe here.</i>

1074
01:12:32,982 --> 01:12:35,350
<i>She's not gonna be back,</i>
<i>your call girl.</i>

1075
01:12:35,352 --> 01:12:38,353
<i>She was paid by the hour.</i>

1076
01:12:45,995 --> 01:12:47,528
<i>Hey.</i>

1077
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:55,470
<i>♫ When you were here before ♫♫</i>

1078
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:21,829
Wakey-wakey, q.
Look what I got. I fixed it.

1079
01:13:21,831 --> 01:13:24,832
Check this out.
Look what I made. All right.

1080
01:13:24,834 --> 01:13:27,735
Prototype,
soul-searching device.

1081
01:13:27,737 --> 01:13:29,904
What do you want?

1082
01:13:29,906 --> 01:13:32,940
He's a cranky bastard, ain't we?

1083
01:13:32,942 --> 01:13:36,611
Is this what I lost
weeks of sleep for?

1084
01:13:36,613 --> 01:13:39,714
Look, this call
you're waiting for,

1085
01:13:39,716 --> 01:13:42,583
it's a figment
of your imagination.

1086
01:13:42,585 --> 01:13:44,619
There's no such thing.

1087
01:13:44,621 --> 01:13:46,954
Not by phone at least.
Ask your shrink.

1088
01:13:46,956 --> 01:13:47,956
Yeah.

1089
01:13:47,957 --> 01:13:51,459
Yo, yo, yo, doc, you there?

1090
01:13:51,461 --> 01:13:52,927
Tell him there's no phone call.

1091
01:13:55,464 --> 01:13:57,165
I'm authorizing you

1092
01:13:57,167 --> 01:13:58,833
to tell him the truth.

1093
01:14:02,471 --> 01:14:05,006
Come on, tell him
he's delusional.

1094
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:11,078
<i>It's true, qohen.</i>

1095
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:14,649
<i>Your phone call's a delusion.</i>
<i>Sorry about that.</i>

1096
01:14:16,385 --> 01:14:19,353
<i>I was programmed</i>
<i>to leave your peculiar</i>

1097
01:14:19,355 --> 01:14:22,089
<i>pathology untreated.</i>

1098
01:14:22,091 --> 01:14:23,925
All right. Thanks, babes.

1099
01:14:23,927 --> 01:14:25,126
See you.
<i>But I didn't...</i>

1100
01:14:25,128 --> 01:14:27,962
The truth ain't pretty, q.

1101
01:14:27,964 --> 01:14:29,597
But like my old man says,

1102
01:14:29,599 --> 01:14:32,033
it'll set you free.

1103
01:14:32,035 --> 01:14:34,335
Your call ain't carried
by British telecom.

1104
01:14:34,337 --> 01:14:36,971
It's coming from your soul,
connect with it.

1105
01:14:36,973 --> 01:14:38,940
You know

1106
01:14:38,942 --> 01:14:41,209
how everything inside you
releases energy.

1107
01:14:41,211 --> 01:14:44,745
This suit will pick up the data

1108
01:14:44,747 --> 01:14:47,215
and relay it back
to mancom's neural net.

1109
01:14:47,217 --> 01:14:49,951
How can you believe in the soul
if you believe in nothing?

1110
01:14:49,953 --> 01:14:53,187
It's called a paradox, q.

1111
01:14:53,189 --> 01:14:56,224
I'm young enough to believe
all kinds of things.

1112
01:14:56,226 --> 01:14:58,159
Did you know...

1113
01:14:59,728 --> 01:15:02,563
That more than 33 different
aboriginal tribes believe

1114
01:15:02,565 --> 01:15:05,933
that the soul resides somewhere
in the lower digestive tract?

1115
01:15:07,536 --> 01:15:09,070
Absolutely true.

1116
01:15:09,905 --> 01:15:12,607
But here's the zinger.

1117
01:15:12,609 --> 01:15:14,375
None of these tribes
have any knowledge

1118
01:15:14,377 --> 01:15:16,544
of each other's existence.

1119
01:15:16,546 --> 01:15:19,280
Coincidence?
Hm?

1120
01:15:19,282 --> 01:15:20,915
Coincidence?

1121
01:15:20,917 --> 01:15:22,917
Where do you think all these

1122
01:15:22,919 --> 01:15:26,354
separate peoples
got such an idea?

1123
01:15:26,356 --> 01:15:27,722
Dysentery.

1124
01:15:27,724 --> 01:15:31,659
Aha. Q, you're getting
to be very funny lately.

1125
01:15:31,661 --> 01:15:33,928
Listen up, if you have a soul,

1126
01:15:33,930 --> 01:15:35,763
which I'm betting you do,

1127
01:15:35,765 --> 01:15:37,765
this baby will locate it

1128
01:15:37,767 --> 01:15:40,501
and connect you with it.

1129
01:15:42,605 --> 01:15:46,307
Did you order pizza?
Did you order pizza?

1130
01:15:56,084 --> 01:15:57,451
Can I come in?

1131
01:16:25,847 --> 01:16:27,081
It's management's son.

1132
01:16:27,083 --> 01:16:30,785
You know management, don't you?

1133
01:16:32,254 --> 01:16:33,788
I'm so sorry.

1134
01:16:35,390 --> 01:16:39,126
Joby told me I could have
the vr suit if I played along.

1135
01:16:40,796 --> 01:16:42,830
And you just seemed just...

1136
01:16:43,732 --> 01:16:46,300
well, you were lonely.

1137
01:16:46,302 --> 01:16:47,935
You're wrong.

1138
01:16:47,937 --> 01:16:51,305
We were always alone,
never lonely.

1139
01:16:51,307 --> 01:16:53,808
Qohen, please.

1140
01:16:55,644 --> 01:16:58,079
Bainsley, Bob.
Bob, bainsley.

1141
01:17:01,016 --> 01:17:02,650
She won't be staying long.

1142
01:17:02,652 --> 01:17:04,085
Hi.
Hi.

1143
01:17:04,087 --> 01:17:06,787
The Hawaiian tropics chick, eh?

1144
01:17:06,789 --> 01:17:08,789
Marooned yourself with this guy?

1145
01:17:08,791 --> 01:17:10,825
Well, we expect technology

1146
01:17:10,827 --> 01:17:13,861
supplied the necessary
enticement.

1147
01:17:13,863 --> 01:17:16,330
Yeah, she's like a 10.

1148
01:17:16,332 --> 01:17:19,634
There's no way she'd want
an old guy, q. No offense.

1149
01:17:19,636 --> 01:17:22,103
None taken.
But I do want him.

1150
01:17:22,105 --> 01:17:23,838
I think,

1151
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:25,473
and I'm pretty sure.

1152
01:17:25,475 --> 01:17:28,242
What for?
Heh, heh.

1153
01:17:28,244 --> 01:17:30,878
There's just
something about him.

1154
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:32,747
Yeah, right.

1155
01:17:32,749 --> 01:17:34,915
Must be the preservatives

1156
01:17:34,917 --> 01:17:36,984
hey, don't laugh at me.

1157
01:17:39,121 --> 01:17:40,488
Sorry.

1158
01:17:42,591 --> 01:17:44,158
I know it doesn't
make sense, but...

1159
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:47,495
I need you...
I need you to believe me.

1160
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:54,735
You said you never wanted
to leave me.

1161
01:17:54,737 --> 01:17:57,471
That wasn't us,
that was someone else.

1162
01:17:57,473 --> 01:18:00,174
No, that was you,

1163
01:18:00,176 --> 01:18:01,575
stripped of all your fear.

1164
01:18:01,577 --> 01:18:04,679
A cheap virtual trick.

1165
01:18:04,681 --> 01:18:07,481
What are you really afraid of?

1166
01:18:09,017 --> 01:18:11,118
We accept your apology

1167
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:14,155
and wish you well in all
your future endeavors.

1168
01:18:14,157 --> 01:18:17,291
Hoping that management
will assign someone else

1169
01:18:17,293 --> 01:18:19,527
to serve as the object
of your affection.

1170
01:18:26,301 --> 01:18:28,803
Well...

1171
01:18:30,106 --> 01:18:33,274
Everything I own
is in my van outside.

1172
01:18:33,276 --> 01:18:36,744
I don't know
where I'm going, but...

1173
01:18:36,746 --> 01:18:38,546
Will you come with me?

1174
01:18:39,881 --> 01:18:42,550
Jesus, q, do it.

1175
01:18:44,653 --> 01:18:47,588
We're afraid it is too late.

1176
01:18:47,590 --> 01:18:51,158
It is time bainsley was
on her way. We have work to do.

1177
01:18:54,930 --> 01:18:57,331
We'll go somewhere far away,

1178
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:01,435
to a special place,

1179
01:19:01,437 --> 01:19:03,471
on a tropical island.

1180
01:19:03,473 --> 01:19:05,172
A real one.

1181
01:19:06,141 --> 01:19:08,209
Just come with me.

1182
01:19:10,579 --> 01:19:14,648
I know we connected
somehow, you know?

1183
01:19:14,650 --> 01:19:16,250
I know we did.

1184
01:19:18,019 --> 01:19:20,087
And you need me.

1185
01:19:21,957 --> 01:19:24,492
And I need to be needed so bad.

1186
01:19:29,131 --> 01:19:31,165
Just come with me.

1187
01:19:34,903 --> 01:19:37,338
You know we can be
together for real.

1188
01:19:39,541 --> 01:19:41,675
Just run away with me.

1189
01:19:45,514 --> 01:19:47,414
No, we can't.

1190
01:20:37,132 --> 01:20:40,601
Jesus Christ, q,
do you have any heart at all?

1191
01:20:47,876 --> 01:20:51,212
Hey, hey, do you need a break?
Yeah.

1192
01:20:52,414 --> 01:20:54,715
We feel like a rat
in a rat trap.

1193
01:20:54,717 --> 01:20:57,885
I've been ready to gnaw
my foot off since I got here.

1194
01:20:57,887 --> 01:21:00,821
Let's get out of this tomb.

1195
01:21:00,823 --> 01:21:02,456
Do you mean us?
Yeah.

1196
01:21:02,458 --> 01:21:04,859
You and...
Me and yous.

1197
01:21:04,861 --> 01:21:08,629
Come on. Whatever happened
to giving up that "we" shit?

1198
01:21:08,631 --> 01:21:11,799
Well, we've been trying.

1199
01:21:11,801 --> 01:21:15,536
Yeah, sure you have. Come on.
Let's go. Up. Come on.

1200
01:21:15,538 --> 01:21:18,839
We haven't been outside
in over a year.

1201
01:21:18,841 --> 01:21:21,141
What happened to you, man?

1202
01:21:23,478 --> 01:21:24,912
Life happened to me.

1203
01:21:24,914 --> 01:21:27,348
Look, life happens
to everybody, all right?

1204
01:21:27,350 --> 01:21:30,284
Try thinking about somebody
besides your own selves.

1205
01:21:30,286 --> 01:21:32,553
I'm tired. I'm stressed.

1206
01:21:32,555 --> 01:21:36,056
And I'm traumatized for
the rest of my poor love life

1207
01:21:36,058 --> 01:21:37,791
with the way
you dissed that bainsley,

1208
01:21:37,793 --> 01:21:40,060
who is a scabillion times

1209
01:21:40,062 --> 01:21:42,096
the woman
that you deserve, so...

1210
01:21:43,164 --> 01:21:45,733
I need a break, q, all right?
So get your...

1211
01:21:45,735 --> 01:21:49,036
get your fucking head
out of your ass and follow me.

1212
01:21:50,573 --> 01:21:54,108
- There we are.
- Come on. Come on, let's go.

1213
01:21:56,478 --> 01:21:59,613
- Penny for your thoughts?
- No, go. Go.

1214
01:21:59,615 --> 01:22:01,115
Come on.
Come on, then.

1215
01:22:01,117 --> 01:22:05,552
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.
Come on. Come on.

1216
01:22:05,554 --> 01:22:09,556
Hey, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

1217
01:22:09,558 --> 01:22:11,425
You don't need...

1218
01:22:11,427 --> 01:22:14,028
You don't need skin cancer.

1219
01:22:14,030 --> 01:22:16,130
Right, there you go.
This is a big day.

1220
01:22:16,132 --> 01:22:18,599
A big day.
We're going to the park.

1221
01:22:18,601 --> 01:22:22,403
And I got this new song too,
just for you. Let's go.

1222
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:26,507
<i>Good morning.</i>

1223
01:22:26,509 --> 01:22:29,510
You having fun?
Excuse us?

1224
01:22:29,512 --> 01:22:31,679
Are you having a good time?

1225
01:22:31,681 --> 01:22:33,580
Approximately.

1226
01:22:33,582 --> 01:22:37,318
<i>- Your dreams are our dreams.</i>-

1227
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:41,021
<i>"Enough is never enough."</i>
<i>Call us today.</i>

1228
01:22:41,023 --> 01:22:43,057
Jeez. What are you doing?

1229
01:22:43,059 --> 01:22:44,558
Get out of my way.
Punks!

1230
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:47,127
Fuck you.
I know, I know, I'm fucking...

1231
01:22:47,129 --> 01:22:49,897
<i>... Reaches out</i>
<i>to that special you.</i>

1232
01:22:54,103 --> 01:22:56,570
They'll never get it up.

1233
01:22:58,274 --> 01:23:00,274
A little tail
would make that thing

1234
01:23:00,276 --> 01:23:03,110
more aerodynamically active.

1235
01:23:05,513 --> 01:23:09,550
Ready? One, two, three.

1236
01:23:09,552 --> 01:23:11,785
You ever have a girlfriend?

1237
01:23:13,421 --> 01:23:16,824
Yeah, we had a girlfriend
when we were your age.

1238
01:23:16,826 --> 01:23:19,860
We spent every possible
moment with our long walks,

1239
01:23:19,862 --> 01:23:23,497
movies, lying in the backyard
staring up at the stars,

1240
01:23:23,499 --> 01:23:27,368
until her parents
called her in, sent us home.

1241
01:23:27,370 --> 01:23:30,771
Very much in love with her,
as we recall.

1242
01:23:30,773 --> 01:23:32,373
What ever happened to her?

1243
01:23:32,375 --> 01:23:37,044
We married her,
she eventually divorced us

1244
01:23:37,046 --> 01:23:39,246
and we never saw her again.

1245
01:23:39,248 --> 01:23:41,782
Thanks for that happy,
hopeful little parable.

1246
01:23:41,784 --> 01:23:46,520
I can hardly wait for
my own first divorce. Heh.

1247
01:23:46,522 --> 01:23:48,355
- Yeah, more, more.
- That's it, yeah.

1248
01:23:48,357 --> 01:23:50,724
I don't know any girls my age.

1249
01:23:50,726 --> 01:23:54,461
Seems like getting old
would be pretty boring.

1250
01:23:54,463 --> 01:23:55,829
Old people, they just...

1251
01:23:55,831 --> 01:23:58,399
they do the same thing
day after day after day.

1252
01:23:58,401 --> 01:24:02,102
Like listening to the same song
over and over and over.

1253
01:24:02,104 --> 01:24:03,837
Yeah, maybe it's a good song.

1254
01:24:03,839 --> 01:24:07,107
Maybe. After a while,
it gets old.

1255
01:24:07,109 --> 01:24:10,577
Aah!
Get out of here. Go.

1256
01:24:13,448 --> 01:24:15,015
You know, I'm 15.

1257
01:24:15,017 --> 01:24:18,819
I'm 15 and already tons of stuff
bores me to death.

1258
01:24:18,821 --> 01:24:22,556
Think about what will happen
when I get as old as you.

1259
01:24:27,162 --> 01:24:29,096
I'm about to crash.

1260
01:24:29,098 --> 01:24:30,597
I need some food.

1261
01:24:30,599 --> 01:24:32,733
Do us a couple of dogs, q?

1262
01:24:32,735 --> 01:24:36,336
A couple of wieners
for a couple of weenies.

1263
01:24:37,372 --> 01:24:39,139
Can we have some relish on ours?

1264
01:24:39,141 --> 01:24:41,975
Of course.
You got it.

1265
01:24:41,977 --> 01:24:45,479
You know, I just met her,
but I really miss bainsley.

1266
01:24:45,481 --> 01:24:48,248
Must be killing you,
losing a doll like that.

1267
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:50,651
Sorry, man.
I'm going.

1268
01:24:59,694 --> 01:25:02,496
<i>Just come with me.</i>

1269
01:25:02,498 --> 01:25:05,099
<i>We connected.</i>

1270
01:25:05,101 --> 01:25:06,767
<i>You need me.</i>

1271
01:25:07,869 --> 01:25:10,904
<i>And I need to be needed so bad.</i>

1272
01:25:21,283 --> 01:25:22,683
What's the matter?

1273
01:25:22,685 --> 01:25:25,986
Just realizing what a jerk
you were dumping bainsley?

1274
01:25:25,988 --> 01:25:28,522
I'm just thinking...

1275
01:25:28,524 --> 01:25:30,924
Did I just hear
what I think I heard?

1276
01:25:32,527 --> 01:25:36,797
I told you.
I've been working on it.

1277
01:25:36,799 --> 01:25:39,700
That's what
I like about you, man.

1278
01:25:39,702 --> 01:25:43,504
You're not too old a dog
to learn new tricks.

1279
01:25:54,215 --> 01:25:57,217
What's wrong?
I'm just dizzy. I'm dizzy.

1280
01:25:57,219 --> 01:25:59,353
Just a little dizzy.

1281
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:03,490
You're burning up.

1282
01:26:03,492 --> 01:26:06,059
Happens when I don't sleep.
Not a big deal.

1283
01:26:06,061 --> 01:26:07,594
You need medical attention.

1284
01:26:07,596 --> 01:26:11,031
Just get me two aspirin
and run me a cool bath.

1285
01:26:15,904 --> 01:26:18,539
I feel better already.

1286
01:26:19,908 --> 01:26:22,876
I just need some sleep.

1287
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:34,955
<i>Bob?</i>

1288
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:37,791
<i>Bob?</i>

1289
01:28:08,417 --> 01:28:10,150
Unh!

1290
01:28:44,218 --> 01:28:47,254
I... no.

1291
01:28:47,256 --> 01:28:50,490
I don't wanna take...

1292
01:28:50,492 --> 01:28:53,593
I knew nothing.

1293
01:29:08,209 --> 01:29:10,811
Ow.

1294
01:29:20,955 --> 01:29:22,723
Unh!

1295
01:29:28,863 --> 01:29:32,366
You have made
a very big mistake.

1296
01:29:32,368 --> 01:29:34,768
He just needs some rest.
Yeah.

1297
01:29:36,404 --> 01:29:37,971
Come on.

1298
01:29:39,741 --> 01:29:42,042
I wouldn't wanna be
in your shoes.

1299
01:29:42,044 --> 01:29:44,478
Here we go.

1300
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:47,080
We'll be back tomorrow
for the hardware.

1301
01:29:47,082 --> 01:29:49,282
Don't touch anything.

1302
01:29:49,284 --> 01:29:52,052
We have notified
your supervisor.

1303
01:30:31,726 --> 01:30:33,260
Quinn, you bastard.

1304
01:30:36,597 --> 01:30:38,665
I just called by

1305
01:30:38,667 --> 01:30:42,369
to say thank you for
getting me fired from my job.

1306
01:30:42,371 --> 01:30:45,071
You're still a tool.

1307
01:30:45,073 --> 01:30:48,575
At least I'm not playing
Patty-cake in a bathtub

1308
01:30:48,577 --> 01:30:51,044
with a teenage boy,
you sick freak.

1309
01:30:51,046 --> 01:30:53,246
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

1310
01:30:53,248 --> 01:30:55,949
I know what I know.

1311
01:30:55,951 --> 01:30:59,186
I had a good job till you
came along and you fucked it up

1312
01:30:59,188 --> 01:31:02,456
and you fucked up zip-t
and you fucked up poor old Bob.

1313
01:31:02,458 --> 01:31:06,226
Well, I'm here to say fuck you
and the entity around it all.

1314
01:31:06,228 --> 01:31:09,930
That's f-u-q-u, Quinn!

1315
01:31:09,932 --> 01:31:13,900
You know my name.
I know who you are.

1316
01:31:15,536 --> 01:31:17,370
Leth!

1317
01:31:18,539 --> 01:31:20,373
Do you?

1318
01:32:17,933 --> 01:32:20,400
Unh!

1319
01:32:37,585 --> 01:32:41,521
I'm afraid you won't find
my son here, Mr. leth.

1320
01:32:41,523 --> 01:32:44,090
He's been hospitalized.

1321
01:32:44,092 --> 01:32:45,392
Is he all right?

1322
01:32:47,228 --> 01:32:50,530
If I believed in miracles,
I'd be praying for one now.

1323
01:32:50,532 --> 01:32:52,666
He's not well.

1324
01:32:52,668 --> 01:32:55,802
My son's never been well.

1325
01:32:55,804 --> 01:32:57,103
I've tried to protect him,

1326
01:32:57,105 --> 01:32:59,172
but he's always chafed
at my touch.

1327
01:32:59,174 --> 01:33:03,009
This morning, he stole a car
from my vintage collection.

1328
01:33:03,011 --> 01:33:05,812
Are you real
or are you just in my mind?

1329
01:33:05,814 --> 01:33:07,013
It doesn't matter at all.

1330
01:33:07,015 --> 01:33:10,584
You're part of
the neural net now.

1331
01:33:10,586 --> 01:33:13,954
So there's no answer?
Depends on the question.

1332
01:33:13,956 --> 01:33:15,589
What I'm living for?

1333
01:33:15,591 --> 01:33:17,257
That's a good question,
Mr. leth,

1334
01:33:17,259 --> 01:33:19,292
posed to the entirely
wrong person.

1335
01:33:19,294 --> 01:33:22,629
You seem to have mistaken me
for a considerably higher power.

1336
01:33:22,631 --> 01:33:26,166
I'm not the source of your call.
I'm not God or the devil.

1337
01:33:26,168 --> 01:33:29,202
I'm just a man
seeking the truth.

1338
01:33:29,204 --> 01:33:33,373
What truth if...?
Turn around and look.

1339
01:33:33,375 --> 01:33:34,808
That's it.

1340
01:33:34,810 --> 01:33:37,644
Chaos encapsulated.

1341
01:33:38,847 --> 01:33:41,114
That's all there is at the end,

1342
01:33:41,116 --> 01:33:44,184
just as it was at the beginning.

1343
01:33:44,186 --> 01:33:47,120
There it is then.
You've proved the zero theorem.

1344
01:33:47,122 --> 01:33:51,224
Not quite. Mancom is still,
as you said, crunching the data.

1345
01:33:51,226 --> 01:33:55,695
Why would you want to prove
that all is for nothing?

1346
01:33:55,697 --> 01:33:59,633
I never said all is for nothing.
I'm a businessman, Mr. leth.

1347
01:33:59,635 --> 01:34:01,534
Nothing is for nothing.

1348
01:34:03,271 --> 01:34:07,273
What?
There's money
in ordering disorder.

1349
01:34:07,275 --> 01:34:09,109
Chaos pays, Mr. leth.

1350
01:34:09,111 --> 01:34:11,277
Chaos comprises
a rich vein of ore

1351
01:34:11,279 --> 01:34:14,681
that with mancom's muscle
will be all mine

1352
01:34:14,683 --> 01:34:16,282
to mine.

1353
01:34:16,284 --> 01:34:17,951
The saddest aspect

1354
01:34:17,953 --> 01:34:20,487
of mankind's need
to believe in a God,

1355
01:34:20,489 --> 01:34:21,988
or to put it another way,

1356
01:34:21,990 --> 01:34:23,957
a purpose greater
than this life,

1357
01:34:23,959 --> 01:34:26,292
is that it makes
this life meaningless.

1358
01:34:26,294 --> 01:34:28,294
You see, this is all
just a weigh station

1359
01:34:28,296 --> 01:34:30,830
on the road
to promised eternity.

1360
01:34:30,832 --> 01:34:32,732
The reason I chose you...

1361
01:34:32,734 --> 01:34:34,934
I mean, rather perversely,
I admit,

1362
01:34:34,936 --> 01:34:39,406
is because you represent
the antithesis of my project.

1363
01:34:39,408 --> 01:34:40,874
A man of faith.

1364
01:34:40,876 --> 01:34:42,308
You see, you've persisted

1365
01:34:42,310 --> 01:34:44,110
in believing that a phone call

1366
01:34:44,112 --> 01:34:45,745
could give your life meaning.

1367
01:34:45,747 --> 01:34:47,781
You've waited and waited
for that call,

1368
01:34:47,783 --> 01:34:51,184
and as a result,
you've led a meaningless life.

1369
01:34:52,853 --> 01:34:57,090
I'm sorry, but I no longer
require your services.

1370
01:34:58,492 --> 01:35:02,395
You pervert! You devil!

1371
01:35:02,397 --> 01:35:03,697
You monster!

1372
01:35:03,699 --> 01:35:05,799
You tear me up,
charge me interest!

1373
01:35:05,801 --> 01:35:07,167
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. leth.</i>

1374
01:35:07,169 --> 01:35:10,203

1397
01:36:21,709 --> 01:36:23,109
Oh.

01:36:23,111 --> 01:36:26,379
Yes, you were
the wrong tool, mate.

1399
01:39:51,085 --> 01:39:54,787
<i>♫ When you were here before ♫</i>

1400
01:39:56,223 --> 01:39:59,826
<i>♫ couldn't look you in the eye ♫</i>

1401
01:40:01,095 --> 01:40:05,331
<i>♫ you're just like an angel ♫</i>

1402
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:10,269
<i>♫ your skin makes me cry ♫</i>

1403
01:40:11,305 --> 01:40:15,308
<i>♫ you float like a feather ♫</i>

1404
01:40:16,210 --> 01:40:19,679
<i>♫ in a beautiful world ♫</i>

1405
01:40:21,482 --> 01:40:26,386
<i>♫ I wish I was special ♫</i>

1406
01:40:26,388 --> 01:40:30,556
<i>♫ you're so very special ♫</i>

1407
01:40:31,859 --> 01:40:35,228
<i>♫ but I'm a creep ♫</i>

1408
01:40:36,930 --> 01:40:40,433
<i>♫ and I'm a weirdo ♫</i>

1409
01:40:41,635 --> 01:40:45,838
<i>♫ what the hell</i>
<i>am I doing here? ♫</i>

1410
01:40:47,274 --> 01:40:50,943
<i>♫ I don't belong here ♫</i>

1411
01:40:52,212 --> 01:40:55,848
<i>♫ I don't care if it hurts ♫</i>

1412
01:40:55,850 --> 01:40:57,483
<i>Qohen?</i>

1413
01:40:57,485 --> 01:40:59,485
<i>♫ I wanna have control ♫</i>

1414
01:40:59,487 --> 01:41:02,622
<i>Heh, heh, heh. Qohen.</i>

1415
01:41:02,624 --> 01:41:05,224
<i>♫ I want a perfect body ♫</i>

1416
01:41:05,226 --> 01:41:07,627
<i>Hey, qohen.</i>

1417
01:41:07,629 --> 01:41:10,963
<i>♫ I want a perfect soul ♫</i>

1418
01:41:12,934 --> 01:41:16,302
<i>♫ But I'm a creep ♫</i>

1419
01:41:18,172 --> 01:41:22,775
<i>♫ I'm a weirdo ♫</i>

1420
01:41:22,777 --> 01:41:26,746
<i>♫ what the hell</i>
<i>am I doing here? ♫</i>

1421
01:41:28,482 --> 01:41:32,819
<i>♫ I don't belong here ♫</i>

1422
01:41:35,155 --> 01:41:39,392
<i>♫ I don't belong here ♫♫</i>
