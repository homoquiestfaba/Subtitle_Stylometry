1
00:00:18,881 --> 00:00:20,610
- Lights up!
- Beginners, please!

2
00:00:20,883 --> 00:00:22,851
- Your five-minute call, sir.
- Places.

3
00:00:22,885 --> 00:00:25,319
- Places. Everyone to their places.

4
00:00:25,388 --> 00:00:26,946
Sh. Quiet, everyone.

5
00:00:26,889 --> 00:00:29,380
Opening nights?
I love opening nights.

6
00:00:30,893 --> 00:00:33,418
- How are you? Good to see you.
- Good evening, Charles.

7
00:00:33,396 --> 00:00:34,988
- Sir Herbert, how are you?
- This is my wife.

8
00:00:35,398 --> 00:00:37,161
- Oh, Lady Herbert.
- How do you do?

9
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:37,957
May I give you a peck?

10
00:00:38,401 --> 00:00:40,130
One of Mr Barrie's finest?

11
00:00:39,902 --> 00:00:41,733
Oh, that genius Scotsman
has done it again.

12
00:00:41,904 --> 00:00:44,134
It's the best thing I've produced
in 25 years.

13
00:00:44,407 --> 00:00:46,932
I already have investors interested
back home in New York.

14
00:00:46,909 --> 00:00:50,572
See you on Broadway!

15
00:01:04,427 --> 00:01:07,191
First positions, people.

16
00:01:08,431 --> 00:01:11,127
Standing by, please,
ladies and gentlemen.

17
00:01:11,384 --> 00:01:13,682
If you could take
your opening positions, please.

18
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:21,792
Beginners, please take
your opening positions.

19
00:01:21,811 --> 00:01:25,212
Audience are coming in. Standing by.

20
00:01:28,317 --> 00:01:29,944
- Good audience.
- Sorry?

21
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:31,844
Good audience tonight.

22
00:01:31,821 --> 00:01:34,153
OK. That's great, thank you.
How much longer?

23
00:01:34,323 --> 00:01:36,518
Um, ten minutes, sir.

24
00:01:38,327 --> 00:01:41,160
I love opening nights.

25
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:43,730
I want to dance with your wife
at the after-party.

26
00:01:44,133 --> 00:01:45,691
- Oh, my goodness.
- Good evening, Mr Frohman.

27
00:01:45,968 --> 00:01:47,526
- How are you, John?
- Very well.

28
00:01:47,253 --> 00:01:50,051
It's the best thing
that I've produced in 25 years.

29
00:01:50,339 --> 00:01:52,307
- Hello, George. How are you?
- Healthy and wealthy, I see.

30
00:01:52,341 --> 00:01:54,332
You've rearranged a holiday
for me and I won't forget it.

31
00:01:54,343 --> 00:01:55,810
- For you, Charles, anything.
- You won't regret it.

32
00:01:55,845 --> 00:01:56,834
I'm sure.

33
00:01:57,062 --> 00:01:59,929
- Have you got the tickets?
- They're in my pocket.

34
00:02:00,649 --> 00:02:03,846
- There's Mrs Barrie.
- Oh, Mr and Mrs Snow.

35
00:02:04,153 --> 00:02:08,453
We were so hoping to speak
with your husband before the show.

36
00:02:08,657 --> 00:02:12,115
- Have you seen him?
- I'm not sure where he is, actually.

37
00:02:30,963 --> 00:02:34,729
We do miss seeing you on stage.
You were so wonderful.

38
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:39,681
Yes, well, it's been some time now.
Are you right to find your seat?

39
00:02:40,055 --> 00:02:42,148
Oh, yes, yes.

40
00:02:42,057 --> 00:02:45,151
See you at the party, then.

41
00:02:45,277 --> 00:02:46,710
Excuse me. Could you find Mr Barrie

42
00:02:46,862 --> 00:02:49,956
and remind him that they're doing his play
this evening.

43
00:02:49,865 --> 00:02:52,732
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you.

44
00:03:13,556 --> 00:03:14,716
Let's close the doors.

45
00:03:56,382 --> 00:03:58,543
Really, I mustn't
inconvenience you in this way.

46
00:03:58,884 --> 00:04:00,818
I can wait quite well in the shop.

47
00:04:00,886 --> 00:04:05,414
'Tis no inconvenience.
The shop is chilly. And there is a fire here.

48
00:04:05,391 --> 00:04:06,790
Really, you are uncommonly good.

49
00:04:06,892 --> 00:04:09,383
Sorry, sir.

50
00:04:09,395 --> 00:04:12,558
Mrs Barrie wanted me to remind you
that the play's begun.

51
00:04:12,898 --> 00:04:16,163
- Though I imagine you know that.
- They hate it.

52
00:04:15,901 --> 00:04:19,064
- Sir?
- It's like a dentist's office out there. Why?

53
00:04:19,405 --> 00:04:25,275
- I wouldn't say they hate it, sir.
- What do you think? Do you like it?

54
00:04:25,411 --> 00:04:27,936
- I've just been hired here, sir.
- Yes or no? I'm not bothered.

55
00:04:27,913 --> 00:04:32,282
- I'm not really qualified to...
- Do you like it? Is it crap?

56
00:04:32,418 --> 00:04:34,716
- Crap, sir?
- Go on, say it. Just say it.

57
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,388
It's shite, isn't it? Go on. Say it.

58
00:04:36,422 --> 00:04:39,391
- Don't know if I'm...
- "It's bull's pizzle, Mr Barrie." Go on, say it.

59
00:04:39,425 --> 00:04:40,949
- It's bull's pizzle, Mr Barrie.
- I knew it.

60
00:04:41,427 --> 00:04:45,193
- No, I haven't even seen it.
- I knew it. Thank you.

61
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:47,421
Thank you very much.

62
00:04:49,935 --> 00:04:53,393
Might I knock a tune, milord,
for a moment?

63
00:04:57,443 --> 00:04:58,740
I'm an old man...

64
00:04:59,278 --> 00:05:01,007
..and I've seen few of the sights.

65
00:05:18,847 --> 00:05:20,838
Absolute rubbish from start to finish.

66
00:05:21,216 --> 00:05:22,808
Yes, I found it fearfully dull.

67
00:05:22,718 --> 00:05:24,652
Say goodbye to your investment, old boy.

68
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,154
Good to see you. My apologies.

69
00:05:27,222 --> 00:05:28,883
We'll get them with the next one,
Charles, I promise.

70
00:05:28,724 --> 00:05:32,160
- Of course we will, James.
- I know you put a lot into this one.

71
00:05:32,227 --> 00:05:36,186
A fortune, James, but I am fortunate
because I can afford to lose a fortune.

72
00:05:36,732 --> 00:05:38,859
- Can you?
- No, I can't. How are you?

73
00:05:39,535 --> 00:05:41,469
- Arthur.
- James.

74
00:05:41,537 --> 00:05:43,334
You were sorely missed
at the last club meeting.

75
00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:44,528
Was I?

76
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:48,624
We were beginning to wonder
which is your hobby, writing or cricket.

77
00:05:48,494 --> 00:05:50,394
You wanted to speak with Mr Barrie,
didn't you?

78
00:05:50,496 --> 00:05:53,522
Oh yes, but we shouldn't interrupt them,
should we?

79
00:05:53,499 --> 00:05:55,558
I don't see why not.

80
00:05:55,834 --> 00:05:59,099
If you ask me, the problem
lies in our batting order.

81
00:05:58,921 --> 00:06:00,855
- James.
- Hello, darling.

82
00:06:00,923 --> 00:06:02,652
You remember Mr and Mrs Snow,
don't you?

83
00:06:02,925 --> 00:06:04,654
- Mrs Snow.
- Mr Barrie.

84
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,875
Mr Snow.

85
00:06:06,311 --> 00:06:08,836
The Snows have been waiting
to meet with you all evening.

86
00:06:08,897 --> 00:06:11,161
- Oh, yes.
- Is that right?

87
00:06:11,316 --> 00:06:17,016
Your play this evening,
it was remarkable, wasn't it?

88
00:06:17,656 --> 00:06:19,715
Was it?

89
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:25,563
Well, thank you. That's very kind of you.
I'm glad you liked it.

90
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:29,610
How did you feel it went?

91
00:06:30,452 --> 00:06:32,545
- I think I can do better.
- Really?

92
00:06:48,554 --> 00:06:52,149
- Mary? Hello?
- Yes, James?

93
00:06:52,057 --> 00:06:56,960
I'm headed off for the park if you'd
like to join me. It's a beautiful morning.

94
00:06:57,062 --> 00:06:59,496
You'll be working, won't you?

95
00:07:00,566 --> 00:07:02,864
Perhaps, yes.

96
00:07:03,068 --> 00:07:05,866
I'll let you to your work then.

97
00:07:13,412 --> 00:07:16,711
- Morning, Mr Barrie.
- Morning, Emma.

98
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:21,442
- Have a good day, sir.
- And you.

99
00:07:22,754 --> 00:07:26,383
That's it. Go on, boy. Go get it, boy.

100
00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:31,286
That's right. Good boy. Grab it. Good.

101
00:08:00,793 --> 00:08:04,285
Who do you belong to?
Come on, boy. Come on.

102
00:08:08,016 --> 00:08:12,009
Excuse me, sir,
you're standing on my sleeve.

103
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,746
Am I? So sorry.

104
00:08:15,891 --> 00:08:18,086
I might point out
you're lying under my bench.

105
00:08:18,393 --> 00:08:20,486
I have to, I'm afraid.

106
00:08:20,395 --> 00:08:24,889
I've been put in a dungeon
by the evil Prince George.

107
00:08:24,733 --> 00:08:27,201
I'm sorry if it bothers you.

108
00:08:27,736 --> 00:08:31,399
Well, if you're trapped in the dungeon,
there isn't much to be done now, is there?

109
00:08:30,956 --> 00:08:33,288
Perhaps I could slide a key to you
through the bars.

110
00:08:33,542 --> 00:08:39,276
I wouldn't risk it, sir. The evil
Prince George has tortured many men.

111
00:08:39,665 --> 00:08:41,292
I'm sorry. Is he bothering you, sir?

112
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:45,569
My brother can be
an extremely irritating sort of person.

113
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,547
Aha, Prince George, I gather.

114
00:08:48,006 --> 00:08:52,238
I understand you are the horrible tyrant
who imprisoned this unfortunate wretch.

115
00:08:52,094 --> 00:08:56,155
I'm not horrible really, but a firm ruler, yes.
Kind and tolerant.

116
00:08:56,565 --> 00:08:59,728
And what precisely is...
What did you say your name was?

117
00:08:59,768 --> 00:09:02,669
- Michael.
- What precisely is Michael's crime?

118
00:09:02,688 --> 00:09:05,623
- He's my younger brother.
- Ah.

119
00:09:05,824 --> 00:09:10,989
- Fair enough. Sorry, lad. Cannot free you.
- That's all right.

120
00:09:10,696 --> 00:09:13,028
- Do you mind us playing with your dog?
- No. Go on.

121
00:09:13,282 --> 00:09:17,275
This is Jack, second in line to the throne
and that one's Michael. He's only five.

122
00:09:17,586 --> 00:09:20,680
And I'm in prison for it.

123
00:09:20,672 --> 00:09:25,109
- I'm so sorry. Are my boys bothering you?
- We're not bothering him, Mum.

124
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:27,075
Michael, darling,
come out from under there.

125
00:09:26,845 --> 00:09:29,006
I can't. I'm in prison.

126
00:09:29,548 --> 00:09:31,573
Oh, I see.

127
00:09:31,767 --> 00:09:33,928
JM Barrie. Pleased to meet you.

128
00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:37,398
JM Barrie, the author? A pleasure.
Sylvia Llewelyn Davies.

129
00:09:37,606 --> 00:09:39,233
- Are you a writer?
- I am.

130
00:09:39,391 --> 00:09:42,588
He's a playwright, Jack.
Quite a famous one, at that.

131
00:09:42,644 --> 00:09:44,908
- I apologize. I imagine you're writing.
- No. Not at all.

132
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:48,416
- Where's Peter?
- What have you written, Mr Barrie?

133
00:09:48,483 --> 00:09:55,184
Well, currently, I make my living
entertaining princes and their courts

134
00:09:55,073 --> 00:09:57,701
with my trained bear, Porthos.

135
00:09:58,043 --> 00:09:59,943
If you command your brother,
Peter, to join us,

136
00:09:59,544 --> 00:10:02,945
I am willing, Prince George,
to give you just such a performance

137
00:10:03,465 --> 00:10:06,263
in exchange for the freedom
of this prisoner, of course.

138
00:10:05,968 --> 00:10:07,936
- Very well.
- Very well.

139
00:10:08,887 --> 00:10:10,582
Now...

140
00:10:10,389 --> 00:10:14,758
I want you to pay particular attention
to the teeth.

141
00:10:17,596 --> 00:10:22,397
Some unscrupulous trainers will show you
a bear whose teeth have all been pulled,

142
00:10:22,601 --> 00:10:27,038
while other cowards
will force the brute into a muzzle.

143
00:10:27,072 --> 00:10:33,307
Only the true master would attempt these
tricks without either measure of safety.

144
00:10:35,447 --> 00:10:38,780
- What did you bring me over here for?
- Peter.

145
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,719
This is absurd. It's just a dog.

146
00:10:43,622 --> 00:10:46,216
Come on, darling.

147
00:10:46,508 --> 00:10:50,501
"Just a dog"? "Just"?

148
00:10:50,429 --> 00:10:52,590
Porthos, don't listen to him.

149
00:10:52,764 --> 00:10:54,561
Porthos dreams of being a bear

150
00:10:54,633 --> 00:10:59,366
and you want to dash those dreams
by saying he's "just a dog"?

151
00:10:59,054 --> 00:11:01,545
What a horrible, candle-snuffing word.

152
00:11:01,556 --> 00:11:05,822
That's like saying, "He can't climb
that mountain, he's just a man."

153
00:11:06,061 --> 00:11:10,521
Or, "That's not a diamond, it's just a rock."

154
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,959
"Just."

155
00:11:15,904 --> 00:11:21,103
Fine then. Turn him into a bear. If you can.

156
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:23,139
Peter, where are your manners?

157
00:11:22,911 --> 00:11:27,848
With those eyes, my bonny lad,
I'm afraid you'd never see it.

158
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:33,636
However, with just a wee bit of imagination,

159
00:11:33,672 --> 00:11:37,802
I can turn around right now and see...

160
00:11:37,676 --> 00:11:39,871
the great bear, Porthos.

161
00:11:41,229 --> 00:11:43,459
Dance with me.

162
00:12:45,127 --> 00:12:49,029
Thank you. I don't think I've ever seen
a performance quite like it.

163
00:12:49,131 --> 00:12:53,158
We're here every day, and the bear
is always more than happy to perform.

164
00:12:53,251 --> 00:12:55,378
Well, perhaps we'll see you here
tomorrow then.

165
00:12:55,387 --> 00:12:57,651
Perhaps.

166
00:12:57,889 --> 00:13:00,722
- Peter, jump up please, darling. Quick.
- Bye.

167
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:03,057
Bye.

168
00:13:03,145 --> 00:13:06,581
- Peter, didn't you enjoy that?
- I've seen better.

169
00:13:06,598 --> 00:13:09,624
Well, Michael wanted the bear
kept prisoner with him,

170
00:13:09,601 --> 00:13:12,729
and Peter insisted
that Michael was hardly a prisoner

171
00:13:12,854 --> 00:13:15,755
and Porthos simply wasn't a bear at all.

172
00:13:17,359 --> 00:13:19,987
I do very much hope to see them tomorrow.

173
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:23,605
- What's her name?
- Sylvia. Um...

174
00:13:23,582 --> 00:13:27,484
Mrs... something Davies.

175
00:13:28,587 --> 00:13:30,817
Llewelyn Davies?

176
00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:35,219
- You know her?
- I know who she is, of course.

177
00:13:35,377 --> 00:13:38,073
Why, she's a du Maurier,
for heaven's sake.

178
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:44,216
Her father was the artist.
Her brother's the actor.

179
00:13:44,386 --> 00:13:49,289
And there was something... tragic
that happened with her husband.

180
00:13:49,474 --> 00:13:52,375
Oh, yes. He died.

181
00:13:52,561 --> 00:13:55,962
Cancer of the jaw, I believe.

182
00:13:55,564 --> 00:13:57,623
That's horrible.

183
00:13:58,066 --> 00:14:04,096
Yes. Apparently, he left her with four boys
and no income to speak of.

184
00:14:05,073 --> 00:14:08,372
If it wasn't for her mother's help...

185
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,878
James.

186
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:20,316
- We should have them to dinner.
- Should we?

187
00:14:20,589 --> 00:14:24,923
Absolutely. I've always wanted
to meet Madam du Maurier.

188
00:14:24,593 --> 00:14:29,257
Why, she knows practically
everyone there is worth knowing.

189
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:46,240
- What are you writing about?
- Oh.

190
00:14:46,615 --> 00:14:48,879
Nothing of any great consequence.

191
00:14:50,085 --> 00:14:52,679
I can't write.

192
00:14:53,088 --> 00:14:55,716
Have you ever kept a journal?

193
00:14:56,591 --> 00:14:59,651
Ever tried your hand at writing a play?

194
00:15:00,595 --> 00:15:02,756
Well, then how do you know?

195
00:15:03,598 --> 00:15:07,034
I know. That's all.

196
00:15:07,102 --> 00:15:11,539
I see. Where's your mother today
and the rest of the boys?

197
00:15:11,606 --> 00:15:15,542
Home. Mother's got a bit of a chest cold.

198
00:15:16,978 --> 00:15:22,143
I'm sure everyone would be happy
to see you though. One afternoon.

199
00:15:24,703 --> 00:15:26,967
I should leave you to your writing.

200
00:15:31,042 --> 00:15:33,704
Peter.

201
00:15:33,545 --> 00:15:35,843
I'll see you later then.

202
00:15:45,423 --> 00:15:48,085
Why didn't you tell me, Charles?
You knew it wasn't any good.

203
00:15:48,009 --> 00:15:52,503
Why didn't you tell me. James?
You knew it wasn't any good. Hm?

204
00:15:52,514 --> 00:15:57,178
I took an extended lease on the theater,
keeping the actors on.

205
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,421
- I don't have another play.
- I'm sure you will.

206
00:16:04,025 --> 00:16:06,152
- Won't you?
- We'll see.

207
00:16:06,528 --> 00:16:09,190
I need you to sign for the storage,
Mr Frohman.

208
00:16:10,031 --> 00:16:14,092
- Lower.
- Easy does it. Take your time.

209
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:23,272
It was never meant to be taken seriously.

210
00:16:23,545 --> 00:16:27,140
You know what happened, James?
They changed it.

211
00:16:28,049 --> 00:16:32,042
- They changed what?
- The critics.

212
00:16:33,054 --> 00:16:36,182
They made it important.

213
00:16:41,062 --> 00:16:42,495
Hm?

214
00:16:42,564 --> 00:16:44,657
What's it called?

215
00:16:47,068 --> 00:16:49,195
What's it called?

216
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:52,506
- "Play."
- "Play."

217
00:17:04,386 --> 00:17:06,616
Bang, bang, bang!

218
00:17:06,971 --> 00:17:08,734
Bang!

219
00:17:10,642 --> 00:17:13,008
Return the boy to us, you nasty lnjun.

220
00:17:12,977 --> 00:17:16,344
Our people teach boy lndian ways,
make him great warrior.

221
00:17:16,731 --> 00:17:20,531
Our chief, Running Nose, never let him go.

222
00:17:20,685 --> 00:17:22,778
Bang, bang, bang!

223
00:17:25,323 --> 00:17:28,656
Me wounded, Peter. Time's short.

224
00:17:28,827 --> 00:17:33,025
You go. Spread wings
and soar like eagle above enemy.

225
00:17:32,914 --> 00:17:37,510
Fly back to our chief.
Tell her of my brave defeat.

226
00:17:37,752 --> 00:17:40,220
That's crazy. Indians can't fly.

227
00:17:40,255 --> 00:17:42,485
Of course they can. Go on, go on, go on.

228
00:17:42,257 --> 00:17:44,919
Listen to us, boy.
This lnjun kidnapped you.

229
00:17:45,343 --> 00:17:49,609
Not true. We kidnap no one. You lost boy.

230
00:17:49,431 --> 00:17:54,232
I teach you ways of the brave.
I take you as my own son.

231
00:17:54,552 --> 00:17:57,020
You are not my father.

232
00:17:58,857 --> 00:18:00,984
Bang, bang, bang, bang!

233
00:18:01,025 --> 00:18:02,788
- I've got him!
- Let me go!

234
00:18:02,861 --> 00:18:05,261
- Stop it, you two.
- Ooh, we are awful, aren't we?

235
00:18:05,146 --> 00:18:07,444
- I'm warning you.
- Oh, I'm scared.

236
00:18:07,649 --> 00:18:09,310
Of course, you had a bit of fun
for a change.

237
00:18:09,567 --> 00:18:12,161
- Stop it, you two. Get off!
- Don't.

238
00:18:11,953 --> 00:18:14,183
- Jack!
- Stop it!

239
00:18:14,205 --> 00:18:17,299
- Get off, George!
- Peter.

240
00:18:19,878 --> 00:18:23,712
- I'm terribly sorry.
- No, it wasn't your fault.

241
00:18:23,798 --> 00:18:25,595
I'm afraid it might have been.

242
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:29,702
To be honest, I'm just happy you got him
to join in the game.

243
00:18:29,804 --> 00:18:32,295
Oh, yes, I was a tremendous success.

244
00:18:32,307 --> 00:18:36,107
Mr Barrie, it's more
than I've been able to achieve.

245
00:18:36,311 --> 00:18:40,111
Peter's a different boy since his father died.

246
00:18:40,315 --> 00:18:43,478
You know, I don't think
he's even had a good cry about it.

247
00:18:43,318 --> 00:18:47,914
Well, grief affects us all in different ways,
doesn't it?

248
00:18:47,822 --> 00:18:49,449
Yes, it does.

249
00:18:49,824 --> 00:18:56,024
Oh, by the way, my wife would like
to invite you and the boys over to dinner.

250
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,208
Your mother as well.

251
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,134
Oh.

252
00:19:01,202 --> 00:19:05,002
How kind. That would be lovely.

253
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:08,785
Well...

254
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:12,138
Don't you all look lovely in your little suits?

255
00:19:12,013 --> 00:19:17,849
And, Mrs du Maurier, what a shame it is
that we've not met until this evening.

256
00:19:18,353 --> 00:19:20,048
How kind of you to say so.

257
00:19:19,854 --> 00:19:24,382
Not at all. I can't tell you how many times
I've been to a charity or a social event

258
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:28,193
and seen your name listed
among the organizers.

259
00:19:30,365 --> 00:19:35,268
It's the very thing I would love to do myself

260
00:19:35,537 --> 00:19:38,700
if I could just find the time.

261
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:42,525
My problem is in finding the time
to do everything else.

262
00:19:42,627 --> 00:19:45,721
At the moment I am running
two households.

263
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:47,962
Sylvia believes she can get by
without a housekeeper.

264
00:19:47,999 --> 00:19:49,159
Mother.

265
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,131
My house is quite large enough for us all,

266
00:19:51,169 --> 00:19:55,367
- but the idea of living with me seems...
- Not now, please, mother.

267
00:19:55,807 --> 00:19:58,742
- We help her keep the house in order.
- Don't interrupt, George.

268
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:02,360
- Where did you get your manners?
- Sorry, Grandmother.

269
00:20:02,347 --> 00:20:07,808
Mr Barrie, I understand you've become
playmates of my grandchildren.

270
00:20:07,986 --> 00:20:12,889
- Oh, they indulge me, really.
- On the contrary.

271
00:20:12,991 --> 00:20:18,054
The other day we took to an exploration
of darkest Africa in our garden.

272
00:20:18,363 --> 00:20:23,733
But Mr Barrie was taken ill
by the bite of a... What was it?

273
00:20:23,368 --> 00:20:26,201
Tsetse fly. Quite horrible.

274
00:20:26,371 --> 00:20:28,896
Yes, and he swelled to the size
of a hippopotamus.

275
00:20:28,873 --> 00:20:30,306
Fingers like sausages.

276
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:33,833
And we had to float in him down the river
like he was a great bloated raft.

277
00:20:34,379 --> 00:20:37,712
But the fishing was good, wasn't it?

278
00:20:41,386 --> 00:20:43,320
James.

279
00:20:45,773 --> 00:20:48,139
Please.

280
00:20:48,142 --> 00:20:50,906
- Bye.
- Thank you so much.

281
00:20:50,862 --> 00:20:52,591
- Lovely evening.
- Thank you. Bye.

282
00:20:52,864 --> 00:20:56,425
- Good night.
- Good night.

283
00:20:59,871 --> 00:21:03,363
Well, that was a disaster.

284
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:08,812
Painful.
Utterly painful to see.

285
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,712
I don't know what you mean.
I had a lovely time.

286
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:14,165
Oh, James, please.

287
00:21:13,918 --> 00:21:18,252
"My problem is in finding
the time to do everything else."

288
00:21:18,423 --> 00:21:22,985
- I never felt so judged in my life.
- Judged? How do you mean?

289
00:21:22,927 --> 00:21:25,293
A grown man, for heaven's sake,

290
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:28,228
playing all day long with children?

291
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:33,799
In any case, I hardly think they'll be
the social contact we'd hoped for.

292
00:21:33,688 --> 00:21:37,419
I hadn't really thought of them that way.
I just enjoy their company.

293
00:21:37,692 --> 00:21:40,923
He's been a good friend to us, Mother.

294
00:21:40,695 --> 00:21:44,688
Yes. But what does that mean? Hm?

295
00:21:44,699 --> 00:21:45,666
Surely you don't intend...

296
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:51,160
..to keep spending your afternoons
with those children, do you?

297
00:21:55,209 --> 00:21:56,836
And so today, ladies and gentlemen,

298
00:21:58,429 --> 00:22:00,863
using only the wind
and his own physical strength,

299
00:22:01,015 --> 00:22:04,473
George Llewelyn Davies shall test
the very limits of the atmosphere

300
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:07,010
using his tethered craft. Go on, boy.

301
00:22:06,888 --> 00:22:09,550
- Go on, George.
- You're going to break it, George.

302
00:22:09,774 --> 00:22:11,867
- George, stop!
- I just need a bit more speed.

303
00:22:11,859 --> 00:22:13,724
I want to do it.

304
00:22:14,028 --> 00:22:16,656
Hold off a bit, George.
I think it's in need of a tail.

305
00:22:16,447 --> 00:22:18,642
Oh, wait.

306
00:22:20,234 --> 00:22:22,361
- Here. James, this will do.
- That's a good idea.

307
00:22:22,236 --> 00:22:24,363
- No, it's not heavy enough.
- I want to do it.

308
00:22:24,572 --> 00:22:28,372
- You coming, Peter?
- Porthos!

309
00:22:28,543 --> 00:22:30,602
It'll work this time.

310
00:22:30,628 --> 00:22:33,563
Porthos, give us your bell. That's good.

311
00:22:33,581 --> 00:22:34,775
- Michael?
- Yeah?

312
00:22:34,749 --> 00:22:38,241
- Now, would you like to give it a go?
- Yes, please.

313
00:22:38,252 --> 00:22:41,688
- Oh, he can't run fast enough.
- Of course he can.

314
00:22:42,056 --> 00:22:44,581
- Let him try, Jack.
- Now, George, you hold the kite.

315
00:22:44,642 --> 00:22:45,768
George.

316
00:22:45,643 --> 00:22:49,545
Come on, boys, let's go back up to the top.
Come on, Peter.

317
00:22:49,897 --> 00:22:54,925
Right, George, hold it up. Darling,
you've got to run now. Ready? Ready?

318
00:22:54,986 --> 00:22:57,921
- Run! Run, Michael!
- Run!

319
00:22:57,989 --> 00:22:58,580
Oh.

320
00:22:58,489 --> 00:23:02,585
- Oh, I told you this wasn't going to work.
- I don't think he's fast enough.

321
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,560
It's not going to work
if no one believes in him.

322
00:23:04,662 --> 00:23:07,062
- Now, give him a chance.
- Michael, go back to your starting position.

323
00:23:07,031 --> 00:23:09,522
- Come on, darling, try again.
- George, you take the kite.

324
00:23:09,617 --> 00:23:15,681
Now this time, I don't want a flea's breath
of doubt. We must get that kite in the air.

325
00:23:16,124 --> 00:23:18,957
Right. Look, I think I feel a bit
more breeze. Are you ready, Michael?

326
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:22,002
- You can do it, Michael.
- You've got to run. Run, Michael, run.

327
00:23:21,763 --> 00:23:23,924
- Run!
- That's it!

328
00:23:24,432 --> 00:23:28,198
Yes! He did it!

329
00:23:27,935 --> 00:23:31,166
Keep running! Keep running!

330
00:24:00,802 --> 00:24:03,202
What are you writing about now?

331
00:24:03,304 --> 00:24:05,465
Oh, just making notes.

332
00:24:05,556 --> 00:24:09,959
I'm never really certain what they're about
until I've read them over later.

333
00:24:10,645 --> 00:24:12,840
Something about the kite?

334
00:24:15,399 --> 00:24:17,959
Now, why do you ask that?

335
00:24:19,654 --> 00:24:21,622
I don't know.

336
00:24:21,656 --> 00:24:26,593
If I were a writer I think I could tell
a whole story about flying the kite today.

337
00:24:26,744 --> 00:24:32,080
Perhaps you should then. That's
a fantastic idea. Why not give it a try?

338
00:24:31,866 --> 00:24:36,166
I hope you haven't been talking about
anything too serious with this one.

339
00:24:36,537 --> 00:24:40,496
No. Talking a bit of silliness really.

340
00:24:49,217 --> 00:24:51,185
Can we have him for supper?

341
00:24:51,219 --> 00:24:53,551
Have him to stay for supper, Michael.
We're not cannibals.

342
00:24:53,721 --> 00:24:55,120
You are welcome, you know.

343
00:24:57,725 --> 00:25:00,819
Sylvia. Mr Barrie.

344
00:25:00,728 --> 00:25:02,753
Where have you been?

345
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,743
Flying a kite, Mother,
and having a wonderful time.

346
00:25:04,982 --> 00:25:06,779
I'm sorry. I didn't know
you were coming this evening.

347
00:25:06,951 --> 00:25:10,250
No? Well, apparently you forgot then.

348
00:25:10,037 --> 00:25:13,131
- I brought some supper along for us all.
- You didn't need to do that.

349
00:25:13,241 --> 00:25:15,675
Well, there's no food in the house, is there?

350
00:25:15,743 --> 00:25:17,870
Really. You don't need to wait
till the cupboard is bare.

351
00:25:18,129 --> 00:25:19,960
Please, Mother. Come on, darlings.

352
00:25:19,831 --> 00:25:22,994
Wipe feet. There's been
enough tracking round here.

353
00:25:23,334 --> 00:25:26,531
George, I thought you said you were going
to help your mother take care of the house.

354
00:25:26,337 --> 00:25:28,703
Coat, Michael, please. Yes.

355
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:33,372
- And... coat hanger. Good.
- Will we see you tomorrow?

356
00:25:33,144 --> 00:25:36,511
No. You're going to be helping
round the house tomorrow.

357
00:25:36,681 --> 00:25:39,343
Mother, there is absolutely no need for this.

358
00:25:39,567 --> 00:25:41,967
You can't do everything yourself.

359
00:25:42,153 --> 00:25:47,420
Look at you. You're horribly flush.
You're wearing yourself out.

360
00:25:47,158 --> 00:25:50,753
Thank you for a lovely day, James.
Excuse me, Mother.

361
00:25:50,995 --> 00:25:56,934
So from tomorrow, we're going to have
some discipline around here.

362
00:25:56,701 --> 00:26:01,536
And not one of you will escape.

363
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,325
- Good evening, Mr Barrie.
- Good evening, Sarah.

364
00:26:08,346 --> 00:26:12,510
- Good evening, Mr Barrie.
- Good evening, Emma.

365
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:22,617
You missed supper.

366
00:26:24,028 --> 00:26:27,395
Perhaps I'll have something later.
I have a bit of writing I wanted to do.

367
00:26:27,198 --> 00:26:31,532
Are you sure? It was a lovely meal. Duck.

368
00:26:31,786 --> 00:26:35,552
Sarah let Emma cook this evening.

369
00:26:35,656 --> 00:26:40,025
Is that right? Listen, what would you think
of loaning Emma out to the Davies

370
00:26:40,161 --> 00:26:41,719
for the occasional evening?

371
00:26:41,662 --> 00:26:44,062
They don't actually have a cook.

372
00:26:44,999 --> 00:26:48,400
I take it Mrs Davies enjoyed the meal
that she had here?

373
00:26:51,389 --> 00:26:54,984
I imagine she could use an extra hand
now and again. That's all.

374
00:26:54,892 --> 00:26:57,725
That's very charitable of you.

375
00:26:58,813 --> 00:27:01,907
Perhaps we can send over
some of the silver as well.

376
00:27:02,316 --> 00:27:04,443
And what about linen?

377
00:27:04,318 --> 00:27:07,253
I wouldn't be surprised if some of hers
was looking a bit shabby.

378
00:27:07,154 --> 00:27:09,622
Please, Mary, stop.

379
00:27:10,658 --> 00:27:14,822
Maybe she can send over
some of the things we've run short on.

380
00:27:14,662 --> 00:27:17,495
My husband, for example.

381
00:27:18,416 --> 00:27:21,647
We rarely see him in this house.

382
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:24,649
That hasn't seemed to bother you
for some time now.

383
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:15,568
Lords and ladies, His Royal Highness,
King Michael the Benevolent,

384
00:28:15,556 --> 00:28:18,150
protector of the realm.

385
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:20,960
That scepter's made of wood.

386
00:28:21,062 --> 00:28:24,122
Yes, well, we dream on a budget here,
don't we?

387
00:28:24,565 --> 00:28:29,730
No, I mean, everyone thinks it's made
of gold, but it's just an old hunk of wood.

388
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:32,038
The means to an end, Peter.

389
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:35,982
What we've done is taken
an old hunk of wood

390
00:28:35,993 --> 00:28:40,259
and transformed it for all the world to see
into the most magnificent gold.

391
00:28:41,449 --> 00:28:45,010
- There you go.
- What's this?

392
00:28:45,036 --> 00:28:50,633
All great writers begin with a good
leather binding and a respectable title.

393
00:28:51,125 --> 00:28:53,389
Open it.

394
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:58,421
"The Boy Castaways."

395
00:28:58,432 --> 00:29:02,960
"Being a record of the terrible adventures
of the brothers Davies,

396
00:29:03,437 --> 00:29:08,204
faithfully set forth by...
Peter Llewelyn Davies."

397
00:29:07,942 --> 00:29:10,934
Kipling would swallow his own ear
for a title like that.

398
00:29:11,028 --> 00:29:13,997
Stab him, George. You can do it.

399
00:29:14,482 --> 00:29:17,076
I still have no idea what to write.

400
00:29:17,368 --> 00:29:19,928
Write about anything.
Write about your family.

401
00:29:20,071 --> 00:29:22,869
- Write about the talking whale.
- What whale?

402
00:29:22,957 --> 00:29:29,021
The one that's trapped in your imagination
and desperate to get out. Come sit down.

403
00:29:32,216 --> 00:29:36,175
I have actually begun writing about the
adventures of the Davies brothers myself.

404
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:39,485
- A play?
- A play indeed, yes.

405
00:29:39,723 --> 00:29:42,214
And I would be extremely honored

406
00:29:42,226 --> 00:29:46,663
if you would allow me the use of your name
for one of the characters.

407
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:49,494
I don't know what to say.

408
00:29:49,233 --> 00:29:51,326
Say yes.

409
00:29:53,237 --> 00:29:54,261
Good man.

410
00:29:54,238 --> 00:29:56,331
Porthos! That's mine. Let go.

411
00:29:56,574 --> 00:29:59,509
I won't go to bed. I won't, I won't.

412
00:29:59,443 --> 00:30:04,346
You should have been in bed
half an hour ago, young man.

413
00:30:04,999 --> 00:30:07,593
I'm afraid I've grown hopelessly lax
in my discipline.

414
00:30:07,501 --> 00:30:10,937
Nonsense. Young boys
should never be sent to bed.

415
00:30:11,005 --> 00:30:14,065
They always wake up a day older.

416
00:30:14,341 --> 00:30:18,300
And then, before you know it,
they're grown.

417
00:30:18,345 --> 00:30:20,370
Their father would have been horrified.

418
00:30:20,347 --> 00:30:22,542
Of course, he never would have allowed
a dog in the house either.

419
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:25,375
He'd have tied him up in the yard.

420
00:30:25,352 --> 00:30:29,345
Right! Last one in bed's a hairy toad.

421
00:31:19,273 --> 00:31:22,401
You mean a lot to my boys, you know.

422
00:31:23,861 --> 00:31:26,694
Especially Peter.

423
00:31:27,448 --> 00:31:31,475
It seems to me
that Peter's trying to grow up too fast.

424
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:39,052
I imagine he thinks that grown-ups don't
hurt as deeply as children do when they...

425
00:31:38,926 --> 00:31:41,520
when they lose someone.

426
00:31:44,381 --> 00:31:49,341
I lost my elder brother, David,
when I was just Peter's age.

427
00:31:49,386 --> 00:31:52,378
And it nearly destroyed my mother.

428
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:55,882
James, I'm so sorry.

429
00:31:56,894 --> 00:32:00,796
Your poor mother.
I can't imagine losing a child.

430
00:32:00,898 --> 00:32:02,923
Aye.

431
00:32:03,901 --> 00:32:06,267
She didn't get out of bed for months.

432
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:09,004
She wouldn't eat.

433
00:32:09,156 --> 00:32:12,387
I tried everything to make her happy, but...

434
00:32:13,661 --> 00:32:16,061
she only wanted David.

435
00:32:16,163 --> 00:32:17,790
So...

436
00:32:17,915 --> 00:32:20,008
one day...

437
00:32:21,001 --> 00:32:24,095
I dressed myself in David's clothing

438
00:32:26,507 --> 00:32:29,067
and I went to her.

439
00:32:28,892 --> 00:32:32,089
You must have frightened her to death.

440
00:32:32,313 --> 00:32:38,081
I think it was the first time
she ever actually... looked at me.

441
00:32:42,656 --> 00:32:45,750
And that was the end of the boy James.

442
00:32:48,245 --> 00:32:51,146
I used to say to myself
he'd gone to Neverland.

443
00:32:51,081 --> 00:32:53,174
Where?

444
00:32:53,167 --> 00:32:56,762
Neverland. It's a wonderful place.

445
00:33:06,714 --> 00:33:10,081
I've not spoken about this before
to anyone.

446
00:33:10,718 --> 00:33:12,618
Ever.

447
00:33:22,529 --> 00:33:26,488
What's it like... Neverland?

448
00:33:29,153 --> 00:33:32,088
One day I'll take you there.

449
00:33:33,624 --> 00:33:35,319
Wait a minute, James.
He's a fairy?

450
00:33:35,626 --> 00:33:39,323
Er, no. He's the irrepressible
spirit of youth. Tinker Bell is the fairy.

451
00:33:39,129 --> 00:33:42,428
- Tinker Bell is a woman?
- She's not a woman. She's a fairy.

452
00:33:42,633 --> 00:33:45,625
He is a boy who stays young forever.

453
00:33:45,636 --> 00:33:47,968
James, how does anyone
stay young forever? It doesn't work.

454
00:33:48,138 --> 00:33:50,834
He just believes, Charles.
He imagines life the way he wants it to be,

455
00:33:51,141 --> 00:33:56,272
and he believes in it long enough and hard
enough that it all appears before him, see?

456
00:33:56,146 --> 00:33:58,842
James, I'm your friend.
You're coming off a flop.

457
00:33:59,149 --> 00:34:03,449
- You have a man who is a fairy.
- No, a boy who has a fairy.

458
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:05,101
And this girl calls herself Tinker.

459
00:34:05,272 --> 00:34:09,299
And you have a pirate ship on stage
surrounded by tons and tons of water.

460
00:34:09,276 --> 00:34:11,369
- That's a lot of water.
- It's a lot of water.

461
00:34:11,278 --> 00:34:15,078
- Yes, and that's a lot of money.
- It is, but we can fake the water.

462
00:34:15,282 --> 00:34:18,080
Oh, well, if we can fake the water
then I'm sure your play will be a hit.

463
00:34:18,285 --> 00:34:21,652
You know what I think I'll do? I think
I'll imagine life the way I want it to be...

464
00:34:21,789 --> 00:34:22,653
Long enough and hard enough?

465
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:27,193
Yes, and then the money for the play
will appear magically before me.

466
00:34:27,294 --> 00:34:29,057
- That's right. That's it.
- Yes.

467
00:34:29,296 --> 00:34:32,197
How does the clock wind up
inside the crocodile?

468
00:34:32,299 --> 00:34:34,460
- He swallows it.
- Ah, of course he does.

469
00:34:36,553 --> 00:34:38,111
Out!

470
00:34:40,441 --> 00:34:42,136
How was he?

471
00:34:41,859 --> 00:34:43,850
- Well done.
- Good show!

472
00:34:45,946 --> 00:34:48,141
I finally get the courage
to invite the boys to a game

473
00:34:47,948 --> 00:34:51,111
and we have to suffer
this grave humiliation.

474
00:34:51,318 --> 00:34:53,183
It's perfect actually.

475
00:34:53,036 --> 00:34:55,266
Spend a good deal of time with them,
don't you?

476
00:34:55,539 --> 00:34:57,837
Every moment I can spare, in fact.

477
00:34:58,041 --> 00:35:00,168
I'm glad for you.

478
00:35:00,544 --> 00:35:04,071
And Mrs Davies seems to be
having a good time of it as well.

479
00:35:04,131 --> 00:35:08,693
You should be aware though, James,
what some people have been saying.

480
00:35:09,052 --> 00:35:12,852
Mind you, I wouldn't bring it up
if I thought the rumors would pass.

481
00:35:13,056 --> 00:35:15,923
I'm not surprised. What are they saying?

482
00:35:17,644 --> 00:35:19,202
Very well.

483
00:35:19,146 --> 00:35:22,604
That you spend much more time with Mrs
Davies than you do with your own wife.

484
00:35:22,649 --> 00:35:25,345
She's a widow. And...

485
00:35:25,652 --> 00:35:28,951
And a friend. That's it. Nothing more.

486
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:34,973
There have also been questions about
how you spend your time with those boys.

487
00:35:35,162 --> 00:35:37,255
And why.

488
00:35:38,115 --> 00:35:42,415
That's outrageous. How could anyone
think something so evil?

489
00:35:42,619 --> 00:35:47,113
They're children.
They're innocent children.

490
00:35:48,292 --> 00:35:50,385
You find a glimmer of happiness
in this world,

491
00:35:50,377 --> 00:35:52,845
there's always someone
who wants to destroy it.

492
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:59,251
No. Thank you, Arthur, but I don't think
many will give credence to such nonsense.

493
00:35:59,386 --> 00:36:01,911
Then why is no one sitting with them?

494
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:05,886
Once you get a bit of notoriety, James,

495
00:36:06,276 --> 00:36:12,237
people watch you and they will
look for ways to drag you down.

496
00:36:15,786 --> 00:36:18,584
Are you sure your wife doesn't
object to us taking over your cottage

497
00:36:18,372 --> 00:36:19,737
for the summer, James?

498
00:36:19,873 --> 00:36:22,171
- She doesn't go there anymore.
- Really?

499
00:36:22,292 --> 00:36:25,056
It's such a relief to get away.
You'll come and visit, I hope?

500
00:36:25,295 --> 00:36:28,059
- Of course. Are we in?
- Everyone in?

501
00:36:28,298 --> 00:36:31,165
- Can I drive, Uncle Jim?
- Er, no.

502
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,425
Out of the way
or I'll make haggis out of you.

503
00:36:48,902 --> 00:36:50,961
Get the sheep out the way.

504
00:37:08,288 --> 00:37:12,019
- Are we there yet?
- Almost. Almost there.

505
00:37:12,292 --> 00:37:15,318
I can see the cottage!

506
00:37:33,113 --> 00:37:36,105
- Shall we explore, Michael?
- Don't tear your clothes, please.

507
00:37:36,116 --> 00:37:39,142
- Come on. Follow me.
- Be careful of stinging nettles.

508
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:40,143
Hurry up, everyone.

509
00:37:46,126 --> 00:37:49,755
- Would you like to see the rest of it?
- Mm. Yes.

510
00:38:11,685 --> 00:38:13,414
'Ello!

511
00:38:13,186 --> 00:38:16,246
Thought you could escape
from Captain Swarthy, eh?

512
00:38:16,189 --> 00:38:20,319
Off to the ship with you, then.
Off to the ship, son!

513
00:38:22,696 --> 00:38:26,928
So now you can either choose
to become a pirate with the rest of us,

514
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,896
or we'll toss you to the sharks.

515
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:35,273
- How marvelous.
- Well, maybe the crocodiles, eh?

516
00:38:35,375 --> 00:38:38,833
- No one's escaped, Captain.
- Excellent work, matey.

517
00:38:38,879 --> 00:38:39,811
Now then.

518
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:43,281
Now is your only chance to speak.

519
00:38:43,383 --> 00:38:46,819
Who amongst you is ready
to tie your hopes and dreams to the sea?

520
00:38:46,887 --> 00:38:49,219
- I am!
- Not finished yet.

521
00:38:49,222 --> 00:38:52,589
To enter upon
the most dangerous chapter

522
00:38:52,726 --> 00:38:56,059
in your young
and soon-to-be-wasted lives?

523
00:38:57,364 --> 00:38:59,423
What did you say? What are doing, son?

524
00:38:59,366 --> 00:39:02,631
Are you giggling? On my ship?
Giggling? What did you say?

525
00:39:02,869 --> 00:39:05,099
- I said I'm ready, Captain.
- What's your name, boy?

526
00:39:05,372 --> 00:39:08,341
I'm Curly, the oldest and wisest of the crew.

527
00:39:08,375 --> 00:39:10,707
Cut him loose, matey.

528
00:39:10,877 --> 00:39:15,075
Welcome aboard, Curly.
Your job will be to mop the deck.

529
00:39:15,882 --> 00:39:18,180
And who be you, young squire?

530
00:39:18,385 --> 00:39:23,755
My name be Nibs the Cut-throat. Feared
by men and greatly desired by the ladies.

531
00:39:23,757 --> 00:39:24,746
Jack!

532
00:39:25,008 --> 00:39:29,069
Welcome aboard, Nibs.
You shall polish all wood surfaces.

533
00:39:29,012 --> 00:39:31,378
Grab a hold of that rigging.

534
00:39:31,682 --> 00:39:34,879
- And you, lad?
- I'm Peter.

535
00:39:35,268 --> 00:39:39,705
That's not a pirate name.
What about Dastardly Jim, eh?

536
00:39:39,773 --> 00:39:43,004
No. Just Peter.

537
00:39:42,776 --> 00:39:44,676
I like my name.

538
00:39:45,779 --> 00:39:48,111
Very well.

539
00:39:48,281 --> 00:39:54,015
In punishment for lack of an interesting
pirate name, Peter shall walk the plank.

540
00:39:53,787 --> 00:39:56,221
Cut him loose.

541
00:40:18,311 --> 00:40:21,212
- What are you playing again?
- The boy.

542
00:40:21,314 --> 00:40:22,713
What have you got...? Excuse me.

543
00:40:23,316 --> 00:40:26,217
Mr Barrie, sir?

544
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:29,482
There's been a mistake here, sir.
It says here I'm to play the nanny.

545
00:40:29,823 --> 00:40:35,022
- I don't imagine I quite fit that part, eh?
- You're not actually the nanny.

546
00:40:34,828 --> 00:40:36,921
You're a dog.

547
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:39,525
- What?
- A Newfound land.

548
00:40:39,332 --> 00:40:41,732
We'll put you in a great big fluffy dog suit.

549
00:40:41,835 --> 00:40:44,269
Rrr.

550
00:40:45,338 --> 00:40:47,533
Oh, right.

551
00:40:49,342 --> 00:40:52,903
Actually, we don't have a Tinker Bell cast,
do we? He could play Tinker Bell.

552
00:40:53,396 --> 00:40:57,298
Heavens, no. Tinker Bell's a light.
It moves around the stage.

553
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:59,869
Just a wee light
that moves around the stage.

554
00:41:02,773 --> 00:41:04,900
Bit worried about this.

555
00:41:05,275 --> 00:41:08,938
Let's see.
We've got John Darling, Michael Darling,

556
00:41:08,778 --> 00:41:11,872
Tiger Lily, Smee, Skylights.

557
00:41:12,282 --> 00:41:16,446
It's a play for puppets.
Tootles, Nibs, Curly.

558
00:41:16,787 --> 00:41:19,381
All these names are absurd
when you see them all together.

559
00:41:19,289 --> 00:41:21,484
Captain Hook, S...

560
00:41:22,292 --> 00:41:25,420
Oh, hello, James.

561
00:41:26,797 --> 00:41:28,321
You're out of your mind.

562
00:41:40,811 --> 00:41:43,143
How were rehearsals?

563
00:41:43,313 --> 00:41:48,774
Fine. Great. They're going... quite well.

564
00:41:48,818 --> 00:41:52,185
- Good.
- Yes. Thank you.

565
00:42:30,327 --> 00:42:33,728
- Hello.
- Hello.

566
00:42:34,281 --> 00:42:38,650
- How was your journey?
- It was quite long. I'm exhausted.

567
00:42:38,869 --> 00:42:42,805
- Let's get you some tea.
- That'd be nice. Thanks.

568
00:42:43,874 --> 00:42:48,072
- Can you come to the playhouse?
- In a moment, Michael. He's just arrived.

569
00:42:47,844 --> 00:42:53,805
But I said I'd get him. They always
send Peter to do things. I said I'll do it.

570
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:58,196
- It will spoil the surprise.
- What surprise, darling?

571
00:42:58,138 --> 00:43:02,837
It's a great surprise. We've taken
most of the day preparing for it.

572
00:43:03,193 --> 00:43:07,391
- Everybody's waiting for you.
- Then we mustn't keep them waiting.

573
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:11,717
Please don't tell them that I told you
the surprise. I said I wouldn't.

574
00:43:11,818 --> 00:43:13,683
Oh, well, you didn't really tell us
anything about it, did you?

575
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:17,613
- Yes I did. It's a play.
- It's a play?

576
00:43:29,636 --> 00:43:32,537
"The Lamentable Tale of Lady Ursula."

577
00:43:32,555 --> 00:43:35,820
"A play in one act
by Peter Llewelyn Davies."

578
00:43:38,478 --> 00:43:42,676
- This is just a bit of silliness, really.
- I should hope so. Go on.

579
00:43:42,849 --> 00:43:45,283
I just wanted to take a stab at writing,
you know.

580
00:43:45,485 --> 00:43:48,045
Well, the others do
a good job with it anyway.

581
00:43:48,071 --> 00:43:50,232
Well, let's see it then.

582
00:43:52,442 --> 00:43:56,037
"The Lamentable Tale of Lady Ursula."

583
00:43:56,446 --> 00:43:58,573
"One morning, just after sunrise,

584
00:43:58,448 --> 00:44:01,975
Lady Ursula, the most beautiful daughter
of Lord and Lady Dubon,

585
00:44:02,202 --> 00:44:07,469
made her way up the steps of the great
cathedral to pray to her blessed saint."

586
00:44:07,791 --> 00:44:10,817
"Suddenly, as she reached
the cathedral doors,

587
00:44:10,593 --> 00:44:13,323
the gargoyle that guarded
the sacred structure

588
00:44:13,596 --> 00:44:16,224
came to life and swooped down upon her."

589
00:44:18,551 --> 00:44:20,781
"The people of the village all ran to safety,

590
00:44:20,804 --> 00:44:23,773
but Lady Ursula slipped
on the cathedral steps

591
00:44:23,606 --> 00:44:27,770
and the gargoyle descended upon her,
wrapping her in its huge wings

592
00:44:28,111 --> 00:44:32,411
and taking her high up into the spires
of the cathedral."

593
00:44:32,649 --> 00:44:35,982
- Go on, Peter.
- "Not long after this sorrowful event,

594
00:44:36,152 --> 00:44:40,816
a young knight named JM Barnaby
came into the city."

595
00:44:41,491 --> 00:44:43,755
Sylvia.

596
00:44:44,127 --> 00:44:46,493
- Do you want some water?
- Mother?

597
00:44:46,629 --> 00:44:50,087
- No, James.
- Let's get her back to the house. Go on.

598
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:57,816
She won't discuss it with me at all.
She claims it was nothing.

599
00:44:57,724 --> 00:45:00,887
I tell you, Doctor, she couldn't breathe.

600
00:45:00,727 --> 00:45:04,254
You can't very well treat a patient
who won't admit there's anything wrong.

601
00:45:04,731 --> 00:45:08,189
Well, you'll have to make her understand
that something is.

602
00:45:08,234 --> 00:45:12,000
- I'll try and do my best.
- Great. Just there.

603
00:45:42,769 --> 00:45:45,067
Get your hand flat like that.

604
00:45:46,222 --> 00:45:48,156
Ow.

605
00:45:49,225 --> 00:45:51,455
Then... Like that.

606
00:46:18,004 --> 00:46:20,097
Come in.

607
00:46:29,015 --> 00:46:32,746
The good doctor didn't feel
up to the challenge on this one.

608
00:46:33,019 --> 00:46:36,546
He thinks you need to go to hospital
for further tests.

609
00:46:36,523 --> 00:46:40,015
Nonsense.
When would I have time for that?

610
00:46:40,026 --> 00:46:44,258
Besides, this family's
had enough of hospitals.

611
00:46:45,532 --> 00:46:49,093
- Perhaps they can help you.
- I know what they can do for me.

612
00:46:49,536 --> 00:46:52,699
I saw what they did for my husband.

613
00:46:52,539 --> 00:46:55,838
No, James. I've no interest in hospitals.

614
00:46:57,043 --> 00:46:59,637
I'm keenly interested
in having some supper.

615
00:47:29,409 --> 00:47:33,869
What did you and Mother decide
to tell us this time? "It's only a chest cold"?

616
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:36,798
- We hadn't decided anything.
- Stop lying to me!

617
00:47:36,716 --> 00:47:39,947
I'm sick of grown-ups lying to me.

618
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:43,280
I'm not lying to you.
I don't know what's wrong.

619
00:47:43,089 --> 00:47:47,583
"Father might take us fishing,"
that's what she said. "ln just a few weeks."

620
00:47:47,927 --> 00:47:50,452
And he died the next morning.

621
00:47:50,313 --> 00:47:52,838
That wasn't a lie, Peter.

622
00:47:53,099 --> 00:47:54,259
That was your mother's hope.

623
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:58,503
He barely moved for a week,
but I started planning our fishing trip.

624
00:47:58,655 --> 00:48:02,716
I will never lie to you. I promise you that.

625
00:48:02,825 --> 00:48:06,386
No, all you'll do is teach me
to make up stupid stories

626
00:48:06,663 --> 00:48:11,191
and pretend that things
aren't happening until...

627
00:48:14,671 --> 00:48:17,071
I won't! I'm not blind.

628
00:48:17,290 --> 00:48:19,815
I won't be made a fool.

629
00:48:20,627 --> 00:48:23,653
What's this? Peter.

630
00:48:24,013 --> 00:48:26,106
The play.

631
00:48:26,599 --> 00:48:29,898
Darling, I wanted to see the rest of it.

632
00:48:31,604 --> 00:48:35,062
Magic's gone out of it a bit now,
hasn't it?

633
00:48:35,558 --> 00:48:38,322
All because of a silly chest cold.

634
00:49:22,605 --> 00:49:24,505
James.

635
00:49:26,609 --> 00:49:28,975
Well, you remember Gilbert Cannan,
don't you?

636
00:49:29,112 --> 00:49:30,306
Good evening.

637
00:49:30,113 --> 00:49:36,313
Mr Cannan has been working on the
committee to fight government censorship.

638
00:49:36,619 --> 00:49:39,110
I know how involved you've been as well.

639
00:49:39,122 --> 00:49:44,389
He wanted to speak to you.
I did think you'd be home so much sooner.

640
00:49:44,627 --> 00:49:47,221
It's been a long evening, Mary.

641
00:49:48,131 --> 00:49:50,065
Yes.

642
00:49:50,133 --> 00:49:52,897
Well, if I'd realized how late it was,
of course.

643
00:49:52,635 --> 00:49:55,866
I should perhaps talk to you
at another time? Not so late?

644
00:49:56,139 --> 00:49:58,198
That will be fine.

645
00:50:00,643 --> 00:50:02,736
We'll talk then.

646
00:50:02,645 --> 00:50:05,512
Thank you for your patience, Mrs Barrie.

647
00:50:05,648 --> 00:50:07,377
Mr Barrie.

648
00:50:07,650 --> 00:50:09,777
- Good night.
- Night.

649
00:50:26,803 --> 00:50:29,863
Well, aren't you going to speak?

650
00:50:29,806 --> 00:50:32,866
What would you like me to say?

651
00:50:33,676 --> 00:50:37,077
"Curious how late Mr Cannan stayed,"
I suppose.

652
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:40,672
And then, let's see. What comes next?

653
00:50:42,685 --> 00:50:45,654
"No later than you were out, James."

654
00:50:45,688 --> 00:50:48,486
"And how is Mrs Davies this evening?"

655
00:50:49,442 --> 00:50:51,808
Oh, yes, I would have a great answer
for that one, wouldn't I?

656
00:50:51,444 --> 00:50:53,537
How dare you.

657
00:50:56,032 --> 00:50:58,398
This isn't one of your plays.

658
00:50:58,534 --> 00:51:02,300
I know that, Mary. It's quite serious.

659
00:51:04,757 --> 00:51:07,954
But I'm not ready for this conversation,
wherever it may lead.

660
00:51:08,261 --> 00:51:13,221
Perhaps we can talk in the morning, yes?
Good night then.

661
00:52:36,215 --> 00:52:40,982
Mr Barrie. Don't you agree
this is a little bit tight?

662
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:45,054
- No. No, in fact I think it's quite... baggy.
- Baggy?

663
00:52:45,224 --> 00:52:47,920
Quite frumpy. I'd bring it right in just there.

664
00:52:48,027 --> 00:52:49,619
That's very tight.

665
00:52:50,029 --> 00:52:52,463
And put maybe a plank of wood there
to straighten him up.

666
00:52:52,532 --> 00:52:54,500
- Oh, aye. Yes, Mr Barrie.
- Plank of wood?

667
00:52:54,534 --> 00:52:56,934
Some wood there on the shoulders as well.

668
00:52:57,036 --> 00:53:00,904
- Otherwise, it's marvelous.
- Right, sir.

669
00:53:13,169 --> 00:53:16,070
- You'll be sick tomorrow.
- I'll be sick tonight.

670
00:53:20,142 --> 00:53:22,542
James.

671
00:53:22,645 --> 00:53:26,445
We're just having some tea.
You remember my mother, of course.

672
00:53:26,649 --> 00:53:29,812
Yes. Of course. How do you do?

673
00:53:32,104 --> 00:53:36,040
- May I take your hat?
- That's enough, boys.

674
00:53:39,412 --> 00:53:41,880
Boys, please don't run in the house.
You'll break something.

675
00:53:42,198 --> 00:53:44,223
Come away from that door.
Come on, come on.

676
00:53:44,283 --> 00:53:47,548
- I'd like a word with you,
Mr Barrie, before you go.

677
00:53:47,286 --> 00:53:49,550
We'll only be a few minutes.

678
00:53:50,006 --> 00:53:52,270
Boys, why don't you go
and play in the garden? Go on.

679
00:53:52,091 --> 00:53:53,854
- Is he in trouble?
- Sh.

680
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:58,196
Because I've been alone with Grandmother
and I know what it's like.

681
00:53:58,264 --> 00:54:02,360
- Should we retire into the study?
- Why don't you join them, dear?

682
00:54:02,051 --> 00:54:04,110
Very well.

683
00:54:06,305 --> 00:54:09,741
- I do apologize for interrupting.
- Would you close the door, please?

684
00:54:09,892 --> 00:54:11,484
Certainly.

685
00:54:11,394 --> 00:54:16,457
Sylvia has told me you have offered her
the services of your household staff.

686
00:54:16,399 --> 00:54:20,665
- Well, not exactly.
- That won't be necessary.

687
00:54:21,037 --> 00:54:23,232
I'll leave that to Sylvia, of course.

688
00:54:23,906 --> 00:54:26,136
You'll leave that to me, Mr Barrie.

689
00:54:25,992 --> 00:54:29,086
You see, I'm moving in here from now on.

690
00:54:29,045 --> 00:54:33,675
- You're moving in?
- I'm going where I'm most needed.

691
00:54:33,916 --> 00:54:36,578
And I can certainly see to it
that this house is managed

692
00:54:36,802 --> 00:54:39,134
without resorting to your charity.

693
00:54:39,171 --> 00:54:44,074
It isn't charity, Mrs du Maurier.
I was only trying to help, as a friend.

694
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:48,429
Have you no idea how much your
friendship has already cost my daughter?

695
00:54:48,564 --> 00:54:51,328
Or are you really that selfish?

696
00:54:51,517 --> 00:54:54,145
I beg your pardon?

697
00:54:54,403 --> 00:54:58,499
Don't you see what a visit
to the summer cottage of a married man

698
00:54:58,407 --> 00:55:01,638
does for a widow's future prospects?

699
00:55:03,195 --> 00:55:07,222
Sylvia needs to find someone.
The boys need a father.

700
00:55:10,119 --> 00:55:14,556
And you are destroying any hope this
family has of pulling itself together again.

701
00:55:14,590 --> 00:55:18,424
I have only wanted good things
for this family, Mrs du Maurier.

702
00:55:18,294 --> 00:55:20,922
I'll look after them.

703
00:55:22,264 --> 00:55:25,131
You have your own family
to concern yourself with.

704
00:55:25,134 --> 00:55:26,931
What are you suggesting?

705
00:55:26,936 --> 00:55:30,929
I'm suggesting that you protect
what you have, Mr Barrie.

706
00:55:31,223 --> 00:55:34,989
That is precisely what I am doing.

707
00:55:57,133 --> 00:56:00,830
I was so certain what I would find in this.

708
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:05,953
Some little confession
would leak out onto the page.

709
00:56:06,175 --> 00:56:08,609
I don't write love notes in my journal.

710
00:56:08,644 --> 00:56:11,078
No.

711
00:56:11,230 --> 00:56:14,688
Still, you knew who I meant, didn't you?

712
00:56:14,734 --> 00:56:17,464
That's some comfort, actually.

713
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:21,050
It means I know you just a little after all.

714
00:56:21,073 --> 00:56:24,770
You needn't steal my journal
to get to know me, Mary.

715
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:29,388
No. I suppose I could just go see the plays.

716
00:56:31,834 --> 00:56:36,635
I was hopelessly naive when I married you.

717
00:56:37,673 --> 00:56:43,168
I imagined that brilliant people
disappeared to some secret place

718
00:56:43,012 --> 00:56:47,210
where good ideas floated around
like leaves in autumn.

719
00:56:47,767 --> 00:56:52,500
And I hoped, at least once...

720
00:56:53,856 --> 00:56:56,791
you would take me there with you.

721
00:56:56,859 --> 00:56:59,851
There is no such place.

722
00:57:01,313 --> 00:57:03,440
Yes, there is.

723
00:57:04,984 --> 00:57:07,077
Neverland.

724
00:57:09,455 --> 00:57:12,219
It's the best you've written, James.

725
00:57:12,124 --> 00:57:16,151
And I'm sure the Davies will adore
the world you've created for them.

726
00:57:16,579 --> 00:57:19,673
I only wish I were part of it.

727
00:57:20,583 --> 00:57:24,212
I've wanted you to be. I've tried.

728
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:29,398
Mary.

729
00:57:29,341 --> 00:57:34,244
I always imagined us going off on
great adventures once we were together.

730
00:57:34,346 --> 00:57:37,873
But we moved into this house
and you started, I don't know,

731
00:57:38,350 --> 00:57:42,218
- you started rearranging the furniture.
- What was I supposed to do, James?

732
00:57:42,354 --> 00:57:44,254
You were always gone.

733
00:57:43,856 --> 00:57:44,948
I was right here.

734
00:57:45,357 --> 00:57:52,354
Sitting in your parlor, staring off
into other worlds as though I didn't exist.

735
00:57:53,282 --> 00:57:55,944
Look. Just give me bit more time
to finish up the play.

736
00:57:56,035 --> 00:57:57,969
To spend with your muse?

737
00:57:58,037 --> 00:58:03,600
No, I'm tired of waiting, James.
I'm tired of looking like a fool.

738
00:58:04,877 --> 00:58:08,244
Well, I can't very well give up the play.

739
00:58:09,348 --> 00:58:11,976
Of course not.

740
00:58:12,301 --> 00:58:17,762
Just come home to me at the end of
the day. Rehearse and be home for dinner.

741
00:58:17,973 --> 00:58:22,933
No more trips to the country,
no more long afternoons in the park.

742
00:58:22,645 --> 00:58:27,105
If you can't give us that much of a chance,

743
00:58:27,533 --> 00:58:30,502
then we must end this.

744
00:58:31,287 --> 00:58:34,154
And I will.

745
00:58:39,211 --> 00:58:41,736
Pitiful display.

746
00:58:47,219 --> 00:58:49,380
Nanny. Nanny.

747
00:58:49,221 --> 00:58:51,815
What?

748
00:58:54,226 --> 00:58:57,593
First you get the pajamas,
then you make the bed.

749
00:58:57,479 --> 00:58:59,640
With my paws?

750
00:58:59,982 --> 00:59:03,383
You make the bed with your paws.
The pajamas you get with your teeth.

751
00:59:03,235 --> 00:59:08,104
Because in fact, being a dog,
you haven't any proper digits, have you?

752
00:59:09,074 --> 00:59:11,634
Well, I don't have any teeth, either.

753
00:59:11,577 --> 00:59:14,137
I mean, I can't see. I can't breathe.

754
00:59:14,446 --> 00:59:17,574
All I've got is this rubbery snout.

755
00:59:20,452 --> 00:59:24,548
- Can we get him some teeth?
- He can have mine.

756
00:59:24,456 --> 00:59:26,686
We'll get you teeth.

757
00:59:26,959 --> 00:59:30,417
- Let's have a wee break, shall we?
- Right.

758
00:59:33,265 --> 00:59:34,732
- I thought you were wonderful.
- You were marvelous.

759
00:59:35,184 --> 00:59:37,209
I think you're better on four legs
than you are on two.

760
00:59:37,186 --> 00:59:39,711
- Oh, give it a rest.
- I do.

761
00:59:41,190 --> 00:59:44,216
- Just say it, Charles, go on.
- Well, you picture it, James.

762
00:59:44,193 --> 00:59:47,856
Opening night, doctors, lawyers,
businessmen and their wives,

763
00:59:48,197 --> 00:59:49,664
all dressed to the nines.

764
00:59:49,698 --> 00:59:54,795
They've paid good money, they're
expecting theater, what we call theater.

765
00:59:54,703 --> 00:59:59,003
The curtain opens and it's crocodiles
and fairies and pirates and lndians.

766
00:59:59,208 --> 01:00:02,609
I don't even know what it is.

767
01:00:02,711 --> 01:00:07,045
But you did know, Charles. You're
an absolute genius, Charles. That's it.

768
01:00:07,166 --> 01:00:09,066
Oh, don't patronize me, James.

769
01:00:09,168 --> 01:00:12,228
You know how much money I put into
this show that I haven't even found yet?

770
01:00:12,504 --> 01:00:15,667
Listen, listen. Opening night,
I want 25 seats set aside.

771
01:00:15,507 --> 01:00:17,600
- Set aside? 25?
- 25 seats.

772
01:00:17,509 --> 01:00:20,205
Scattered throughout the theater.
Two here, two there, three up there.

773
01:00:20,512 --> 01:00:22,537
- Are they paying for it?
- They're filled.

774
01:00:22,481 --> 01:00:24,915
- No, no, no. I'm asking...
- The seats are filled.

775
01:00:24,984 --> 01:00:27,578
- Uncle Jim?
- Hello, boys.

776
01:00:27,987 --> 01:00:29,284
Could I speak to you for a moment,
please?

777
01:00:28,988 --> 01:00:30,717
Certainly.

778
01:00:30,990 --> 01:00:34,016
25 seats, Charles. It'll be great.
It'll be fantastic.

779
01:00:33,993 --> 01:00:35,585
25 scattered seats?
Who's paying for them?

780
01:00:35,494 --> 01:00:36,518
Throughout the theater.

781
01:00:36,996 --> 01:00:40,488
- Who's paying for these 25 seats?
- They're filled-up seats, Charles.

782
01:00:40,499 --> 01:00:42,626
Whoa. Look.

783
01:00:42,501 --> 01:00:45,265
This is great. I'm flying.

784
01:00:45,371 --> 01:00:49,705
We don't need to use much pull at all, see?
As long as we've got the balance down.

785
01:00:50,009 --> 01:00:52,477
Mother asked me to take the boys out
for the afternoon.

786
01:00:52,594 --> 01:00:55,256
She said she only wanted a bit of quiet,

787
01:00:55,097 --> 01:00:59,466
but she was trembling so badly
she couldn't even finish her tea.

788
01:00:59,518 --> 01:01:02,681
I'm not a fool, Uncle James.
I deserve to know the truth.

789
01:01:02,888 --> 01:01:06,255
I don't know the truth.
She won't talk about it.

790
01:01:06,108 --> 01:01:08,668
But you think it's serious?

791
01:01:10,779 --> 01:01:13,646
It could be. The doctor felt
she should go and have some tests.

792
01:01:13,782 --> 01:01:15,613
Then you'll have to convince her
to go then.

793
01:01:15,784 --> 01:01:18,184
I've tried. She won't listen to me.

794
01:01:19,371 --> 01:01:20,531
And lately, to be quite honest,

795
01:01:20,372 --> 01:01:25,105
it seems that all my best intentions for
your family have come to nothing but harm.

796
01:01:25,377 --> 01:01:27,641
Apparently I've made
quite a mess of things.

797
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:31,077
It's Grandmother, isn't it?
She's run you off, hasn't she?

798
01:01:31,083 --> 01:01:36,282
Oh, she's absolutely tried with great effort.
And perhaps with good reason.

799
01:01:36,171 --> 01:01:39,698
It isn't you, Uncle Jim. She just...

800
01:01:39,675 --> 01:01:44,044
She just doesn't want
to see Mother hurt anymore.

801
01:01:47,566 --> 01:01:50,501
Look at that.

802
01:01:50,569 --> 01:01:53,231
How magnificent.

803
01:01:54,273 --> 01:01:56,366
The boy's gone.

804
01:01:58,777 --> 01:02:04,215
Somewhere during the last 30 seconds,
you've become a grown-up.

805
01:02:04,116 --> 01:02:07,813
Right then. I think you should be the one
to talk to her, George.

806
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:13,922
- But I wouldn't know what to say.
- You'll do fine. You'll do just fine.

807
01:02:13,926 --> 01:02:17,191
Mr Barrie, sir. Sorry to interrupt.

808
01:02:16,929 --> 01:02:21,093
- It's Nana, he's expired backstage.
- What's happened?

809
01:02:21,433 --> 01:02:24,163
I think his costume is too tight.

810
01:02:24,436 --> 01:02:29,840
It's not possible, too tight.
George, give me a minute, I'll be back.

811
01:02:33,228 --> 01:02:37,927
Pull that one tight.
Here, last one.

812
01:02:39,651 --> 01:02:41,778
OK. Flap those wings.

813
01:02:41,653 --> 01:02:43,951
- There you go.
- Whoa!

814
01:02:44,823 --> 01:02:47,291
- Can I have a go?
- Yeah, you can have a little go if you want.

815
01:02:47,326 --> 01:02:48,793
Give that a tug. Go on.

816
01:02:48,827 --> 01:02:51,193
- Just give it a little pull.
- Can I have a go?

817
01:02:51,330 --> 01:02:52,729
- In a minute. In a minute.
- Can I have a go?

818
01:02:52,831 --> 01:02:54,822
- Jack. Pull me higher.
- I have to concentrate.

819
01:02:54,833 --> 01:02:56,460
- Stop it now, boys.
- No, Michael.

820
01:02:56,668 --> 01:02:58,226
Stop mucking about, boys. Come on now.

821
01:02:58,170 --> 01:03:00,138
- I want to do it now.
- No, don't go down there.

822
01:03:00,556 --> 01:03:01,750
What are you...?

823
01:03:04,510 --> 01:03:06,102
Ow!

824
01:03:10,349 --> 01:03:12,613
Oh, no. Oh, no, I'm sorry.

825
01:03:12,601 --> 01:03:15,729
- I'm so sorry.
- George?

826
01:03:21,860 --> 01:03:23,259
Mr Barrie?

827
01:03:23,362 --> 01:03:26,991
Mrs Davies would like a word with you.

828
01:03:27,282 --> 01:03:29,614
No, just Mr Barrie.

829
01:03:45,851 --> 01:03:51,153
- Did you encourage this?
- Encourage what?

830
01:03:51,223 --> 01:03:55,387
Oh, James, please.
You know perfectly well what.

831
01:03:56,228 --> 01:04:02,497
George won't allow them to set his arm
unless I submit to an examination.

832
01:04:03,986 --> 01:04:07,149
I see. Well, I suppose you'll have to then,

833
01:04:07,489 --> 01:04:12,586
because he's quite a stubborn young man
when he sets his mind to it.

834
01:04:12,744 --> 01:04:17,545
This is absurd.
They won't tell me anything different.

835
01:04:17,249 --> 01:04:19,717
Different?

836
01:04:19,751 --> 01:04:22,345
So you've already spoken to a doctor then?

837
01:04:22,754 --> 01:04:25,518
That is not your concern.

838
01:04:31,146 --> 01:04:35,412
My understanding is that my condition
may be quite serious.

839
01:04:35,651 --> 01:04:40,452
However... my wish is that
life should go on as normal.

840
01:04:41,406 --> 01:04:42,896
So,

841
01:04:43,408 --> 01:04:46,002
I'll have the examination,

842
01:04:45,911 --> 01:04:49,039
and I'll take whatever medications
they advise.

843
01:04:48,914 --> 01:04:51,747
But I don't want to know what they're for.

844
01:04:51,917 --> 01:04:56,013
And I don't want you inquiring into it
any further.

845
01:04:56,922 --> 01:04:59,288
Wouldn't dream of it.

846
01:05:18,026 --> 01:05:20,119
Mary?

847
01:05:22,030 --> 01:05:24,294
Mary?

848
01:05:45,387 --> 01:05:48,288
Peter, could you help George
to fold a pocket handkerchief, please?

849
01:05:48,473 --> 01:05:51,772
- They're in the linen cupboard. Darling?
- Yes, Mother.

850
01:05:51,476 --> 01:05:55,572
Jack, how do you manage
to always come untucked?

851
01:05:55,814 --> 01:05:58,009
Would you check your shirt-tails
in the intermission, please?

852
01:05:58,317 --> 01:05:59,545
Yes, Mother.

853
01:05:59,818 --> 01:06:02,252
You're not planning on attending
any after-theater events, are you?

854
01:06:02,321 --> 01:06:06,018
Only for a short time if we do. The tickets!

855
01:06:06,024 --> 01:06:08,185
- With the children?
- George!

856
01:06:08,026 --> 01:06:11,086
Um, possibly. Would you see
if George has the tickets, please?

857
01:06:11,029 --> 01:06:14,487
- I'll just check the dressing table.
- Sylvia, there's a...

858
01:06:15,033 --> 01:06:19,595
Mother, please see if George has
the tickets. Michael, where are your socks?

859
01:06:19,538 --> 01:06:21,870
Wait here, don't move.

860
01:06:56,491 --> 01:06:59,392
Take her feet, George.

861
01:07:01,546 --> 01:07:03,912
We'll need some more blankets.

862
01:07:05,133 --> 01:07:08,102
Oh, take Michael with you, would you?

863
01:07:10,639 --> 01:07:14,871
She looks much worse
than when we were at the cottage.

864
01:07:15,143 --> 01:07:18,306
Sh, Michael.

865
01:07:18,146 --> 01:07:21,138
- Those 25 seats, has anyone shown up?
- No, sir. Not yet.

866
01:07:21,149 --> 01:07:23,617
Precisely. Have there been
many people asking for seats?

867
01:07:24,152 --> 01:07:25,141
- Yes, sir.
- Charles.

868
01:07:25,153 --> 01:07:27,212
I suggest you start selling them.
Yes, James?

869
01:07:27,322 --> 01:07:29,119
Have you seen any of the Davies family
yet this evening?

870
01:07:28,824 --> 01:07:30,121
The 25 seats, are they filled?

871
01:07:30,325 --> 01:07:32,020
- It's taken care of.
- Yes. Yes.

872
01:07:32,327 --> 01:07:35,387
Who did you invite? Because obviously
whoever you invited decided not to come.

873
01:07:35,414 --> 01:07:37,974
- The seats will be filled, I promise.
- Yes. You've been promising me all...

874
01:07:37,916 --> 01:07:39,543
- Charles?
- Hello, Mr Stanley.

875
01:07:39,918 --> 01:07:41,647
Have you seen the Davies family
this evening?

876
01:07:41,420 --> 01:07:42,409
No, sir.

877
01:07:43,255 --> 01:07:46,486
- Jack has gone to get Dr Brighton.
- Oh, no, Mother. I don't need a doctor.

878
01:07:46,258 --> 01:07:48,351
Yes, you do, dear.

879
01:07:50,262 --> 01:07:53,322
I think I'll get some camomile
to help you relax.

880
01:07:53,265 --> 01:07:57,258
Peter will be here if you need anything.

881
01:08:03,275 --> 01:08:04,936
Peter.

882
01:08:05,277 --> 01:08:07,336
Peter.

883
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:17,652
Can I do anything, Mother?

884
01:08:17,823 --> 01:08:19,916
No, darling.

885
01:08:21,326 --> 01:08:23,658
You must go to the play.

886
01:08:24,830 --> 01:08:28,926
- I can't do that.
- Yes, you can.

887
01:08:28,834 --> 01:08:31,359
I need you to.

888
01:08:31,670 --> 01:08:36,539
I need you to come back tonight
and tell me every bit of it.

889
01:08:36,675 --> 01:08:38,336
Please.

890
01:08:38,176 --> 01:08:41,236
It's only a play, Mother.

891
01:08:41,179 --> 01:08:44,080
It doesn't matter.

892
01:08:48,570 --> 01:08:50,834
What do you want?

893
01:08:51,072 --> 01:08:53,870
Take it out.

894
01:08:56,077 --> 01:08:58,841
Open it.

895
01:09:07,923 --> 01:09:11,256
I've never been so proud of you.

896
01:09:24,606 --> 01:09:27,507
Last call, please, ladies and gentlemen.
Last call.

897
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:30,385
Yes, yes, yes. It's all right. They know.

898
01:09:30,645 --> 01:09:34,376
We had time to sell those 25 seats.
The play's starting.

899
01:09:46,661 --> 01:09:47,685
- Charles.
- What?

900
01:09:47,662 --> 01:09:51,621
- They're here.
- Who's here?

901
01:09:54,669 --> 01:09:58,264
Do forgive them being a bit late -
short legs, long walk from the orphanage.

902
01:09:58,173 --> 01:10:00,403
I'm not clear what they're doing here.

903
01:10:00,675 --> 01:10:02,267
- They've come to see the play.
- Mm-hm.

904
01:10:02,177 --> 01:10:04,077
- That's the 25 seats.
- Mm.

905
01:10:04,179 --> 01:10:08,343
25 seats given to orphans. Right.
Now my nightmare is complete.

906
01:10:08,683 --> 01:10:10,742
You can start your play now.

907
01:10:10,685 --> 01:10:12,744
Your play.

908
01:10:17,742 --> 01:10:20,711
Get them in the scattered seats.

909
01:10:35,844 --> 01:10:38,972
Just there, boys.

910
01:11:10,412 --> 01:11:13,506
Excuse me, sir. This way.

911
01:11:13,415 --> 01:11:15,474
Thank you.

912
01:11:15,917 --> 01:11:19,011
Looks like we got
one of the better-dressed ones.

913
01:11:19,421 --> 01:11:23,881
I just want you to know,
I think you're a wonderful dog.

914
01:11:23,925 --> 01:11:26,155
Thanks.

915
01:12:25,820 --> 01:12:29,756
I won't go to bed. I won't. I won't.

916
01:12:29,407 --> 01:12:31,238
Nana, it isn't six o'clock yet.

917
01:12:31,710 --> 01:12:34,008
Two minutes more.

918
01:12:33,795 --> 01:12:36,229
Please. One minute more.

919
01:12:36,581 --> 01:12:41,382
Nana, I will not be bathed.
I tell you, I will not be bathed.

920
01:12:46,391 --> 01:12:48,985
Who are you?

921
01:12:55,567 --> 01:13:00,266
No one there. Yet I feel sure I saw a face.

922
01:13:01,072 --> 01:13:03,506
My children.

923
01:13:04,826 --> 01:13:08,125
- How is she?
- She's resting.

924
01:13:08,329 --> 01:13:10,263
- May I see her?
- No, Mr Barrie.

925
01:13:10,198 --> 01:13:13,190
I don't think we need to include you in
everything that goes on in this household.

926
01:13:13,451 --> 01:13:15,646
- But she'd want to see him.
- Be quiet, George.

927
01:13:15,453 --> 01:13:16,818
And since, as I've discovered,

928
01:13:16,755 --> 01:13:20,748
you've seen fit to conceal certain facts
about my daughter's condition from me,

929
01:13:21,092 --> 01:13:24,084
I feel no remorse at excluding you
from my home.

930
01:13:23,878 --> 01:13:25,004
But you can't...

931
01:13:25,380 --> 01:13:28,907
- Go upstairs, George, now.
- Stop ordering me about.

932
01:13:28,883 --> 01:13:31,078
This isn't your home. It's our home.

933
01:13:31,386 --> 01:13:33,354
Just cos Mother's
needed your help recently

934
01:13:33,388 --> 01:13:35,652
doesn't give you the right
to rule over her existence.

935
01:13:35,390 --> 01:13:38,052
She's not a child anymore,
and neither am I.

936
01:13:38,359 --> 01:13:40,759
If she wants to see Uncle Jim,
she can see Uncle Jim.

937
01:13:40,729 --> 01:13:43,823
There's nothing you can do about it.

938
01:13:47,652 --> 01:13:50,746
- Mother?
- Yes, darling?

939
01:13:53,158 --> 01:13:55,820
James.

940
01:13:55,660 --> 01:13:58,424
No. Your play.

941
01:14:01,166 --> 01:14:04,226
Look at all this.

942
01:14:04,169 --> 01:14:06,467
I'd have come tonight, it's just...

943
01:14:06,671 --> 01:14:09,799
- Mother, you need to rest.
- ..l still have things to do here.

944
01:14:10,725 --> 01:14:13,853
See? This needs mending.

945
01:14:13,728 --> 01:14:17,255
Four boys, no end of patches.

946
01:14:17,232 --> 01:14:20,065
Can't seem to keep up.

947
01:14:21,186 --> 01:14:24,019
I haven't the time for all this.

948
01:14:24,823 --> 01:14:30,693
Don't look at me like that, James.
You make me feel so utterly exposed.

949
01:14:32,497 --> 01:14:37,992
Boys, would you give me a moment
with your mother, please? Thank you.

950
01:14:57,772 --> 01:15:00,502
They can see it, you know.

951
01:15:01,776 --> 01:15:04,176
You can't go on just pretending.

952
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:08,215
"Just pretending"?

953
01:15:10,285 --> 01:15:14,221
You brought pretending
into this family, James.

954
01:15:15,790 --> 01:15:18,850
You showed us we can change things
by simply believing them to be different.

955
01:15:18,793 --> 01:15:21,284
A lot of things, Sylvia, not everything.

956
01:15:21,296 --> 01:15:24,527
But the things that matter.

957
01:15:25,583 --> 01:15:32,147
We've pretended for some time now
that you're a part of this family, haven't we?

958
01:15:37,095 --> 01:15:44,228
You've come to mean so much to us all
that now it doesn't matter if it's true.

959
01:15:47,605 --> 01:15:49,971
And even if it isn't true,

960
01:15:50,825 --> 01:15:53,794
even if that can never be...

961
01:15:56,331 --> 01:15:59,266
I need to go on pretending.

962
01:16:01,336 --> 01:16:03,463
Until the end.

963
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:07,933
With you.

964
01:16:08,843 --> 01:16:13,177
- Oh, I am sweet.
- How do you do it?

965
01:16:13,514 --> 01:16:18,076
You just think lovely, wonderful thoughts
and they lift you up in the air.

966
01:16:20,972 --> 01:16:26,501
You are so nippy at it.
Couldn't you do it very slowly once?

967
01:16:30,398 --> 01:16:34,334
Yes, I've got it now, Wendy.

968
01:16:34,402 --> 01:16:37,701
I must blow fairy dust on you first.

969
01:16:47,382 --> 01:16:49,907
Now try. Try it from the beds.

970
01:16:50,468 --> 01:16:54,404
Just wriggle your shoulders like this
and then let go.

971
01:16:56,057 --> 01:16:59,220
- I flew!
- How ripping!

972
01:16:59,761 --> 01:17:01,786
Now join hands.

973
01:17:05,817 --> 01:17:08,684
- Look at me!
- I do like it!

974
01:17:10,772 --> 01:17:14,071
- Bravo!
- Let's go out.

975
01:17:14,409 --> 01:17:18,345
Second on the right
and straight on till morning.

976
01:17:18,413 --> 01:17:20,711
Genius.

977
01:17:24,535 --> 01:17:29,404
- Sylvia, don't move.
- I feel a little better.

978
01:17:29,540 --> 01:17:33,169
- It's been a bad day, that's all.

979
01:17:34,545 --> 01:17:37,514
Now I want you to go back to the theater.

980
01:17:37,548 --> 01:17:40,108
Find Peter.

981
01:17:40,051 --> 01:17:44,112
- Of course.
- Thank you.

982
01:17:47,558 --> 01:17:51,688
Are you sure there's nothing else
I can do for you?

983
01:17:52,563 --> 01:17:54,656
No.

984
01:17:56,567 --> 01:17:58,194
Well,

985
01:17:58,069 --> 01:18:01,300
I have always wanted to go to Neverland.

986
01:18:01,739 --> 01:18:04,799
You did promise to tell me about it,
you know.

987
01:18:05,326 --> 01:18:08,318
Aye. That I did.

988
01:18:09,464 --> 01:18:12,900
It's a bit late for it tonight though, I'm afraid.

989
01:18:14,502 --> 01:18:17,960
Perhaps some time soon though?

990
01:18:24,896 --> 01:18:27,524
Most definitely.

991
01:18:27,398 --> 01:18:32,631
- D'you mean we shall both be drowned?
- Look how the water is rising.

992
01:18:35,907 --> 01:18:39,468
It must be the tail of the kite
we made for Michael.

993
01:18:39,410 --> 01:18:44,746
You remember. It tore itself
out of his hands and floated away.

994
01:18:45,917 --> 01:18:50,479
- The kite. Why shouldn't it carry you?
- Both of us.

995
01:18:51,422 --> 01:18:54,755
It can't lift two. Michael and Curly tried.

996
01:18:54,425 --> 01:18:57,519
I won't go without you, Peter.

997
01:18:57,929 --> 01:19:00,489
Let us draw lots which is to stay behind.

998
01:19:00,431 --> 01:19:03,423
And you a lady? Never.

999
01:19:06,437 --> 01:19:07,995
Ready, Wendy?

1000
01:19:07,939 --> 01:19:09,907
Peter!

1001
01:19:09,941 --> 01:19:12,409
Don't let go, Wendy.

1002
01:19:12,443 --> 01:19:14,911
Peter, I'm frightened.

1003
01:19:14,946 --> 01:19:17,813
Hang on, Wendy!

1004
01:19:19,450 --> 01:19:21,315
Peter!

1005
01:19:20,952 --> 01:19:24,786
To die will be an awfully big adventure.

1006
01:19:41,222 --> 01:19:43,782
- I'm glad you came.
- Well...

1007
01:19:45,226 --> 01:19:48,855
I've never missed an opening.

1008
01:19:48,729 --> 01:19:50,822
So I...

1009
01:19:51,732 --> 01:19:54,758
assume you heard about Gilbert and I.

1010
01:19:54,735 --> 01:19:56,635
Yes.

1011
01:19:57,738 --> 01:20:00,070
Quite the scandal, so I'm told.

1012
01:20:07,748 --> 01:20:10,478
How are you?

1013
01:20:14,755 --> 01:20:17,622
I'm all right.

1014
01:20:17,758 --> 01:20:20,249
How are you?

1015
01:20:21,262 --> 01:20:23,992
I'm sorry.

1016
01:20:26,767 --> 01:20:29,463
Don't be.

1017
01:20:29,770 --> 01:20:34,935
Without that family, you could
never have written anything like this.

1018
01:20:34,775 --> 01:20:37,369
You need them.

1019
01:20:44,285 --> 01:20:47,118
Goodbye.

1020
01:20:58,416 --> 01:21:00,748
- Mr Barrie.
- Mrs Snow.

1021
01:21:01,419 --> 01:21:05,287
Thank you. That was quite the nicest
evening I've ever spent in the theater.

1022
01:21:04,922 --> 01:21:08,517
Very kind of you to say. Thank you.
Where's Mr Snow this evening?

1023
01:21:08,926 --> 01:21:10,120
Oh.

1024
01:21:09,927 --> 01:21:12,794
I'm afraid he's left us.

1025
01:21:12,930 --> 01:21:15,922
And he would so have loved this evening.

1026
01:21:15,933 --> 01:21:18,424
The pirates and the lndians.

1027
01:21:18,936 --> 01:21:22,804
He was really just a boy himself, you know.

1028
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:25,170
To the very end.

1029
01:21:25,443 --> 01:21:28,708
I'm terribly sorry. How are you doing?

1030
01:21:28,946 --> 01:21:32,905
I'm doing well enough now, thank you.

1031
01:21:32,833 --> 01:21:38,100
I suppose it's all the work
of the ticking crocodile, isn't it?

1032
01:21:38,623 --> 01:21:43,356
Time is chasing after all of us.
Isn't that right?

1033
01:21:44,378 --> 01:21:47,370
- That's right, Mrs Snow.
- Aunt Rose, your drink.

1034
01:21:47,381 --> 01:21:50,839
Thank you. I mustn't keep you.
You've a lot of friends here.

1035
01:21:50,885 --> 01:21:54,412
Well, it's lovely to see you.
I'm terribly sorry, once again.

1036
01:21:55,890 --> 01:21:59,724
- Was that Mr Barrie?
- That was Mr Barrie.

1037
01:21:59,894 --> 01:22:02,658
Well done, Mr Barrie.

1038
01:22:02,897 --> 01:22:05,730
- Good show.
- Well done.

1039
01:22:09,070 --> 01:22:11,903
Psst.

1040
01:22:12,123 --> 01:22:14,216
What did you think?

1041
01:22:14,709 --> 01:22:17,678
- It's about our summer together, isn't it?
- It is.

1042
01:22:17,712 --> 01:22:19,907
- About all of us.
- That's right.

1043
01:22:21,716 --> 01:22:24,412
Did you like it?

1044
01:22:24,719 --> 01:22:27,415
It's magical. Thank you.

1045
01:22:27,722 --> 01:22:30,122
Oh, thank you.

1046
01:22:30,224 --> 01:22:32,021
Thank you, Peter.

1047
01:22:32,226 --> 01:22:36,322
- This is Peter Pan! How wonderful.
- Really?

1048
01:22:36,731 --> 01:22:40,189
You're Peter Pan? Why, you must be
quite the little adventurer.

1049
01:22:40,184 --> 01:22:43,381
Look, it's true.
He has no shadow.

1050
01:22:44,689 --> 01:22:47,180
But I'm not Peter Pan.

1051
01:22:47,358 --> 01:22:49,792
He is.

1052
01:23:00,204 --> 01:23:04,868
And there's been no improvement
since my last visit?

1053
01:23:04,709 --> 01:23:06,768
No.

1054
01:23:12,133 --> 01:23:15,591
Has James been by at all today, Mother?

1055
01:23:18,055 --> 01:23:20,319
Dr Brighton. May I have a word?

1056
01:23:21,976 --> 01:23:24,672
Excuse me a moment.

1057
01:23:29,116 --> 01:23:32,574
You haven't been keeping him from me,
have you?

1058
01:23:32,653 --> 01:23:34,883
As a matter of fact,
I actually hoped he might come.

1059
01:23:34,739 --> 01:23:37,708
Would have proved me wrong about him.

1060
01:23:37,742 --> 01:23:39,607
Of course, with the success of his play,

1061
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:44,021
the whole of London
must be knocking at his door.

1062
01:23:47,668 --> 01:23:49,829
I'm sorry, dear.

1063
01:23:53,674 --> 01:23:56,973
- What is it?
- It's a secret.

1064
01:23:56,677 --> 01:23:59,737
- Quiet, Michael.
- I didn't say anything.

1065
01:23:59,814 --> 01:24:02,408
Mother, could you come downstairs
for a moment?

1066
01:24:02,933 --> 01:24:05,663
Oh, she can't come downstairs.
What are you thinking of, George?

1067
01:24:05,736 --> 01:24:10,264
Actually, I think a trip downstairs
might do her good, ma'am.

1068
01:24:19,116 --> 01:24:22,984
- What have you been up to?
- Just wait and see.

1069
01:24:31,512 --> 01:24:33,673
It's a play.

1070
01:24:33,431 --> 01:24:37,299
It's not just a play, Michael.
It's the play.

1071
01:24:38,469 --> 01:24:41,836
Of course, we'll have to make do
with a few compromises.

1072
01:24:42,473 --> 01:24:44,566
Much of it will have to be imagined.

1073
01:24:44,475 --> 01:24:47,842
- As it should be.
- As it should be, that's right.

1074
01:24:55,786 --> 01:24:59,244
Michael, come and sit here,
next to Mum.

1075
01:25:03,127 --> 01:25:05,561
When you're ready.

1076
01:25:31,605 --> 01:25:34,199
I won't go to bed. I won't. I won't.

1077
01:25:34,492 --> 01:25:39,759
Nana, it isn't six o'clock yet.
Two minutes more. Please.

1078
01:25:39,830 --> 01:25:43,493
- You know fairies, Peter?
- Yes.

1079
01:25:44,251 --> 01:25:46,742
But they're nearly all dead now.

1080
01:25:46,754 --> 01:25:51,453
You see, Wendy, when the first baby
laughed for the first time,

1081
01:25:51,759 --> 01:25:55,889
the laugh broke into a thousand pieces
and they all went skipping about

1082
01:25:56,046 --> 01:25:58,105
and that was the beginning of fairies.

1083
01:25:58,048 --> 01:26:03,486
And now when every new baby is born,
its first laugh becomes a fairy.

1084
01:26:03,554 --> 01:26:06,853
So there ought to be one fairy
for every boy and girl.

1085
01:26:07,057 --> 01:26:10,151
- Ought to be? lsn't there?
- Oh, no.

1086
01:26:10,227 --> 01:26:14,789
Children know such a lot now.
Soon, they don't believe in fairies.

1087
01:26:14,732 --> 01:26:18,395
And every time a child says,
"l don't believe in fairies,"

1088
01:26:18,652 --> 01:26:21,883
there's a fairy somewhere
that falls down dead.

1089
01:26:25,543 --> 01:26:28,637
Who is that?

1090
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:32,708
The redskins were defeated?

1091
01:26:33,167 --> 01:26:37,228
Wendy and the boys
captured by the pirates?

1092
01:26:37,304 --> 01:26:40,205
I'll rescue her. I'll rescue her!

1093
01:26:42,343 --> 01:26:45,073
Oh, that's just my medicine.

1094
01:26:45,512 --> 01:26:49,539
Poisoned? Who could have poisoned it?

1095
01:26:51,602 --> 01:26:55,299
Why, Tink. You've drunk my medicine.

1096
01:26:57,408 --> 01:27:00,377
It was poisoned.

1097
01:27:01,412 --> 01:27:04,745
And you drank it to save my life?

1098
01:27:06,617 --> 01:27:08,778
Tink.

1099
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:12,953
Are you dying?

1100
01:27:16,961 --> 01:27:19,395
Her light is growing faint.

1101
01:27:20,965 --> 01:27:24,958
If it goes out, that means she's dead.

1102
01:27:27,187 --> 01:27:30,884
Her voice is so low I can scarcely hear
what she's saying.

1103
01:27:30,691 --> 01:27:34,650
She says she thinks
she could get well again

1104
01:27:34,561 --> 01:27:37,428
if children believed in fairies.

1105
01:27:44,071 --> 01:27:47,040
Do you believe in fairies?

1106
01:27:48,542 --> 01:27:51,807
Say quick that you believe.

1107
01:27:54,498 --> 01:27:57,558
If you believe, clap your hands.

1108
01:27:59,219 --> 01:28:02,382
Clap louder.

1109
01:28:07,394 --> 01:28:10,488
Thank you. Thank you.

1110
01:28:53,724 --> 01:28:56,386
That is Neverland.

1111
01:30:19,860 --> 01:30:22,658
So many perfect days.

1112
01:30:23,864 --> 01:30:28,528
I really began to believe
we'd go on like that forever.

1113
01:30:28,869 --> 01:30:31,133
Oh, stop it.

1114
01:30:31,121 --> 01:30:34,284
She wasn't going to stay with you forever.

1115
01:30:35,125 --> 01:30:38,583
She had a husband. My father.

1116
01:30:38,495 --> 01:30:42,056
She never cared for you
the way she did for him.

1117
01:30:43,250 --> 01:30:46,344
I'm not trying to replace your father, Peter.

1118
01:30:46,753 --> 01:30:49,688
I could never do that.

1119
01:30:56,980 --> 01:30:59,039
You'd best let him go.

1120
01:31:01,652 --> 01:31:06,851
George, would you take the boys back
to the house? I'll be with you in a moment.

1121
01:31:07,241 --> 01:31:09,300
Go on, dear.

1122
01:31:16,750 --> 01:31:18,877
I'm terribly sorry.

1123
01:31:19,753 --> 01:31:23,189
I've ruined everything I've touched
in this family.

1124
01:31:23,290 --> 01:31:25,884
Stop giving yourself so much credit.

1125
01:31:25,793 --> 01:31:30,093
Peter's grieving.
It has nothing to do with you.

1126
01:31:31,298 --> 01:31:33,698
Perhaps if I just had
a bit more time with him.

1127
01:31:33,801 --> 01:31:36,964
No, Mr Barrie. That won't be good enough.

1128
01:31:37,304 --> 01:31:43,573
If "a bit more time" is all you can provide,
you'd better leave him alone.

1129
01:31:45,062 --> 01:31:48,930
I know you don't much care for me,
Mrs du Maurier, and I respect that,

1130
01:31:49,066 --> 01:31:52,729
but I loved your daughter very much.

1131
01:31:53,070 --> 01:31:55,436
And I love those boys.

1132
01:31:55,572 --> 01:31:57,631
And I think they need me right now.

1133
01:31:57,574 --> 01:31:59,667
Is that so?

1134
01:31:59,576 --> 01:32:01,806
And for how long after?

1135
01:32:03,080 --> 01:32:05,173
Meaning what?

1136
01:32:05,048 --> 01:32:10,384
Sylvia has requested a co-guardianship
for the boys in her will.

1137
01:32:10,587 --> 01:32:15,115
You, Mr Barrie, and myself.

1138
01:32:17,594 --> 01:32:22,964
- And what do you have to say about that?
- I shall respect my daughter's wishes.

1139
01:32:22,900 --> 01:32:27,667
Something I should have done more of
while she was alive.

1140
01:32:29,406 --> 01:32:31,374
But if you feel you're not ready
for such a commitment,

1141
01:32:31,408 --> 01:32:36,812
I assure you I can certainly
look after the boys by myself.

1142
01:32:36,914 --> 01:32:40,042
Do you think I could abandon those boys?

1143
01:32:49,426 --> 01:32:51,621
Sit down, Peter.

1144
01:33:11,949 --> 01:33:15,407
Mother pasted it back together

1145
01:33:15,202 --> 01:33:17,534
after I ruined it.

1146
01:33:18,705 --> 01:33:20,764
And then I saw the play.

1147
01:33:20,707 --> 01:33:25,576
I just started writing
and I haven't been able to stop.

1148
01:33:27,214 --> 01:33:30,479
She would be very pleased to know that.

1149
01:33:34,221 --> 01:33:38,453
Listen. I've just spoken
with your grandmother

1150
01:33:39,726 --> 01:33:41,921
and I'm staying.

1151
01:33:41,728 --> 01:33:44,663
For good.

1152
01:33:47,234 --> 01:33:49,828
I'm sorry I was so horrible.

1153
01:33:50,988 --> 01:33:53,047
Don't worry.

1154
01:33:56,493 --> 01:33:59,519
It's just...

1155
01:33:59,496 --> 01:34:02,795
I thought she'd always be here.

1156
01:34:04,668 --> 01:34:06,727
So did I.

1157
01:34:08,672 --> 01:34:10,867
But, in fact...

1158
01:34:13,543 --> 01:34:16,171
she is.

1159
01:34:15,929 --> 01:34:21,094
Because she's on every page
of your imagination.

1160
01:34:22,469 --> 01:34:25,666
You'll always have her there. Always.

1161
01:34:31,445 --> 01:34:35,074
But why did she have to die?

1162
01:34:42,205 --> 01:34:44,469
I don't know, boy.

1163
01:34:48,962 --> 01:34:51,522
When I think of your mother...

1164
01:34:52,466 --> 01:34:55,492
I will always remember
how happy she looked

1165
01:34:55,469 --> 01:34:57,699
sitting there in the parlor,

1166
01:34:57,838 --> 01:35:00,705
watching a play about her family.

1167
01:35:00,724 --> 01:35:04,660
About her boys that never grew up.

1168
01:35:07,931 --> 01:35:10,399
She went to Neverland.

1169
01:35:12,936 --> 01:35:17,839
And you can visit her any time you like

1170
01:35:17,941 --> 01:35:20,808
if you just go there yourself.

1171
01:35:22,946 --> 01:35:26,006
How?

1172
01:35:25,949 --> 01:35:29,112
By believing, Peter.

1173
01:35:28,952 --> 01:35:31,443
Just believe.

1174
01:35:44,768 --> 01:35:47,202
I can see her.
