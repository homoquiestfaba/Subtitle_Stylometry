2
00:03:14,398 --> 00:03:17,332
The Gates of Hell have opened.

3
00:04:59,228 --> 00:05:02,043
Mrs. Pushkina, I am Owen.

4
00:05:07,004 --> 00:05:09,208
I don't know any Owen.

5
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:05,590
- Did you have a good trip?
- Yes, thank you.

6
00:09:06,392 --> 00:09:08,115
- Hello.
- Hi.

7
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:08,590
Vlad has not come back yet.

8
00:13:09,138 --> 00:13:10,829
I know.

9
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,255
Uriel disappeared.
We're going to look for him.

10
00:15:05,456 --> 00:15:09,929
You won't find him.
They leave no trace.

11
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,762
What do you want?

12
00:18:38,957 --> 00:18:41,826
Tolstoy sent me.
I must take Owen to the river.

13
00:19:16,236 --> 00:19:18,440
You know that there are
demons where we are going?

14
00:19:21,456 --> 00:19:24,744
Your beliefs are yours to keep, Father.

15
00:19:32,619 --> 00:19:36,961
- Should we speak with them?
- There's no need.  They know who we are.

16
00:20:53,266 --> 00:20:55,681
The problem is not the construction.

17
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:02,214
The river dried before,
but only in the summer...

18
00:21:02,409 --> 00:21:05,606
but now the subway diverted the river and...

19
00:21:06,834 --> 00:21:08,256
They have destroyed the balance.

20
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:11,076
The river runs through the passage
that connects their side and ours.

21
00:21:11,817 --> 00:21:14,501
It is the only thing that keeps
the demons away.

22
00:21:19,785 --> 00:21:22,792
He did it with no help from anyone.
Why didn't you go with him?

23
00:21:59,048 --> 00:22:00,958
This way is safer.

24
00:23:20,295 --> 00:23:22,531
Very polite.
But you should go first.

25
00:24:26,373 --> 00:24:28,762
More demons are appearing.

26
00:24:28,966 --> 00:24:32,032
- I know.
- We have to leave this place.

27
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:35,645
You know that we cannot.
We have to wait for her.

28
00:24:35,846 --> 00:24:38,212
Besides, we cannot
survive out there.

29
00:24:38,405 --> 00:24:41,023
And we can survive here?

30
00:28:44,113 --> 00:28:49,659
No. To continue, we will have
to get permission first.

31
00:28:49,857 --> 00:28:51,515
What do you mean?

32
00:28:51,713 --> 00:28:53,338
This area does not belong
to Tolstoy's people.

33
00:28:53,537 --> 00:28:57,912
We have to speak with the leader
of the people who control this area.

34
00:29:18,816 --> 00:29:21,947
Tolstoy sent me.
I want to speak with Andrey.

35
00:29:22,144 --> 00:29:23,999
Come with me

36
00:29:24,416 --> 00:29:26,751
They come too.

37
00:30:48,191 --> 00:30:50,679
"First day of our confinement

38
00:30:50,878 --> 00:30:56,093
We hide inside the crypt,
where it is safe.

39
00:30:56,286 --> 00:30:59,602
I have been charged with the
difficult task of keeping them safe.

40
00:30:59,807 --> 00:31:04,858
It is not easy to explain
the situation to them.

41
00:31:05,054 --> 00:31:08,022
Savagery has taken
hold of the city.

42
00:31:08,542 --> 00:31:13,944
But we will be safe here."

43
00:31:14,142 --> 00:31:18,332
"10th day of our confinement
I am still waiting patiently.

44
00:31:18,526 --> 00:31:21,395
At times I am overtaken
by doubts and fear...

45
00:31:21,597 --> 00:31:26,104
but obedience and faith
illuminates my way."

46
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:28,636
Do not leave here under
any circumstances!

47
00:31:28,829 --> 00:31:30,204
The children could die.

48
00:31:30,397 --> 00:31:33,114
I will send a sister to tell
you when it is safe.

49
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:37,565
Wait for her; she will bring you
back to us.  God bless you, sister.

50
00:32:27,773 --> 00:32:31,701
You used to be more ruthless. You
never would have let me make it here.

51
00:33:50,587 --> 00:33:54,516
Now we can continue.
They won't stop us.

52
00:36:01,016 --> 00:36:03,504
Why else do you think they
would let us pass?

53
00:36:08,217 --> 00:36:09,427
It would be a good idea...

54
00:36:09,785 --> 00:36:11,672
but they do not cross the river.

55
00:37:02,584 --> 00:37:04,722
You've studied our legends well.

56
00:37:42,487 --> 00:37:44,821
The Gates of Hell have opened.

57
00:38:08,566 --> 00:38:10,454
You do not know where
we have put ourselves!

58
00:38:10,646 --> 00:38:12,751
Here is where they call Hell.

59
00:38:17,686 --> 00:38:21,428
May the power of Christ protect us...

60
00:38:21,686 --> 00:38:27,349
that the demons do not come close to us...

61
00:38:32,246 --> 00:38:35,890
- Be careful.
- Don't worry.

62
00:38:37,046 --> 00:38:41,780
May the power of Christ protect us,
that the demons do not come close to us...

63
00:40:05,972 --> 00:40:07,499
- Where now?
- I do not know.

64
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:10,155
I never come here, and
I don't want to be here.

65
00:40:53,971 --> 00:40:57,266
"13th day of our confinement

66
00:40:58,194 --> 00:41:02,384
The oldest came to me.
Against my orders...

67
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:05,132
two of them had gone
up to the convent...

68
00:41:05,874 --> 00:41:09,900
and saw the Hell that the
demons left in their wake.

69
00:41:23,443 --> 00:41:26,160
Now they believe me
and our situation...

70
00:41:26,354 --> 00:41:29,071
and will never go up again.

71
00:41:29,266 --> 00:41:33,968
Nobody will leave here
until the Sister comes for us."

72
00:41:45,826 --> 00:41:47,350
I left it there.

73
00:41:49,573 --> 00:41:51,905
I left it against the wall.

74
00:42:00,401 --> 00:42:03,369
More than you can imagine.
I'm getting out of here.

75
00:42:06,801 --> 00:42:08,743
The water is lower now.

76
00:42:22,065 --> 00:42:24,618
We can leave now.

77
00:42:24,817 --> 00:42:27,534
We have to wait for the Sister.
Don't you remember?

78
00:42:27,729 --> 00:42:30,184
She is here. The time has come.

79
00:42:55,185 --> 00:42:56,167
Where is she?

80
00:42:56,368 --> 00:43:00,263
- The demons have found her.
- How do you know that?

81
00:43:00,464 --> 00:43:05,832
She is different.  She has can see,
and the demons are deaf and blind.

82
00:43:06,032 --> 00:43:08,749
It is as the history says:
She will come in search of them...

83
00:43:08,944 --> 00:43:11,944
and will show the way to them
when the time has come.

84
00:43:12,432 --> 00:43:14,570
The time has come.

85
00:47:32,267 --> 00:47:34,471
"We barely have enough to eat...

86
00:47:34,667 --> 00:47:37,569
but the children are adapting
to this world of shadows.

87
00:47:37,771 --> 00:47:43,139
They have found water and
are catching animals for food."

88
00:48:04,459 --> 00:48:05,710
Ow, fuck!

89
00:51:36,103 --> 00:51:38,721
"I do not know how long
we have been here...

90
00:51:38,918 --> 00:51:42,082
but I know that my time has
come and I can rest in peace.

91
00:51:42,279 --> 00:51:46,883
I fulfilled my mission.
They will wait for the Sister.

92
00:51:47,079 --> 00:51:50,177
The children will not leave.

93
00:51:53,830 --> 00:51:57,758
They know that on the surface
and beyond the river...

94
00:51:57,958 --> 00:52:00,543
there are only demons.

95
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:02,946
We have not forgotten our history.

96
00:52:04,166 --> 00:52:08,094
Long ago, demons
took over the world..."

97
00:52:13,926 --> 00:52:18,116
"...and the angels will
come down to Hell.

98
00:52:18,406 --> 00:52:22,814
Long ago, they came
to our church...

99
00:52:23,013 --> 00:52:28,829
they set everything on fire
and killed the faithful..."

100
00:53:53,156 --> 00:53:56,352
- We should save her.
- Why is she tied?

101
00:53:57,636 --> 00:53:59,775
She may be evil.

102
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:02,522
She seems like a demon...

103
00:54:03,172 --> 00:54:06,750
She is the Sister, that one that
will show the exit to them.

104
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:10,147
The Elder will decide.

105
00:56:08,001 --> 00:56:11,100
We have to let her go and follow her.

106
00:56:11,297 --> 00:56:13,501
She seems like a demon.

107
00:56:13,698 --> 00:56:16,567
- I don't care.
- If she's a demon, she will kill us.

108
00:56:16,769 --> 00:56:19,191
First she will show the way to them.

109
01:01:09,020 --> 01:01:11,703
If she is the Sister, she
will show the way to them.

110
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:15,249
She is tied up, she can
show nothing to them.

111
01:02:55,033 --> 01:02:56,594
Well?

112
01:02:58,073 --> 01:03:00,724
The Elder decided that she
was a demon.

113
01:03:00,922 --> 01:03:02,929
She is not the Sister.

114
01:09:11,090 --> 01:09:14,832
You must go, you must
show the way to them.

115
01:09:52,306 --> 01:09:55,175
They captured me as I
was crossing the river.

116
01:09:58,993 --> 01:10:02,222
I do not know. There was nobody
there, I couldn't see anything.

117
01:10:26,928 --> 01:10:28,270
Someone freed me.

118
01:10:28,465 --> 01:10:31,614
From her voice, it was a little girl.
From her breath, it was a monster.

119
01:10:32,017 --> 01:10:36,546
She wasn't alone.  We have to get out of here,
fast.  We should go towards the river.

120
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:13,767
We don't have a lot of time.

121
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:41,963
Our time has come.
They follow the Sister.

122
01:12:07,083 --> 01:12:08,903
The girl said that it leads to Hell.

123
01:13:42,893 --> 01:13:44,868
Where's the damn exit?

124
01:14:25,868 --> 01:14:27,559
My God!
