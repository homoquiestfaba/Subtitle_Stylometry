1
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,615
- Martha Marcy May Marlene -

2
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:07,904
"MARCY"

3
00:04:08,494 --> 00:04:09,740
"MARCY MAY"

4
00:04:10,756 --> 00:04:11,791
Where are you going?

5
00:05:34,145 --> 00:05:35,434
Marcy?

6
00:05:36,073 --> 00:05:37,416
What are you doin' here?

7
00:05:37,977 --> 00:05:39,635
We were worried about you.

8
00:05:41,754 --> 00:05:43,232
- Well, I'm fine.

9
00:05:44,966 --> 00:05:46,008
- Yeah?

10
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:48,133
Patrick's worried about you.

11
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,281
- I just wanted to come into town.

12
00:05:52,743 --> 00:05:53,949
- Oh, I could've given you a ride.

13
00:05:55,181 --> 00:05:56,355
- I wanted to walk.

14
00:05:57,053 --> 00:05:58,096
- Through the woods?

15
00:06:02,415 --> 00:06:03,297
Can I get you something?

16
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:05,270
- No, thank you.

17
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,632
Are you done?

18
00:06:09,304 --> 00:06:10,205
- Yeah.

19
00:06:10,571 --> 00:06:11,938
You're not gonna finish that?

20
00:06:13,328 --> 00:06:14,813
Okay, thanks.

21
00:06:44,165 --> 00:06:45,290
You ready to go?

22
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,486
- Not right now.

23
00:06:50,182 --> 00:06:51,035
- No?

24
00:07:06,818 --> 00:07:08,114
Hey, don't do that.

25
00:07:09,746 --> 00:07:10,847
Come here.

26
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:14,733
You are shaking.

27
00:07:14,923 --> 00:07:15,941
Calm down.

28
00:07:21,244 --> 00:07:22,625
Alright, you take care of yourself.

29
00:07:48,347 --> 00:07:51,700
Hello.
Hello?

30
00:07:51,735 --> 00:07:53,057
Hi!

31
00:07:56,973 --> 00:07:58,694
- Martha?

32
00:07:58,695 --> 00:07:59,695
Yeah.

33
00:07:59,696 --> 00:08:01,616
- Oh my god!
Where are you?

34
00:08:05,044 --> 00:08:06,915
I'm not sure.

35
00:08:08,222 --> 00:08:09,855
Upstate I think.

36
00:08:10,207 --> 00:08:12,032
- You're in New York?

37
00:08:13,124 --> 00:08:14,081
Yeah.
I think.

38
00:08:14,082 --> 00:08:16,408
- When did you get back?

39
00:08:21,766 --> 00:08:22,732
Martha?
What's wrong?
What's happened?

40
00:08:25,175 --> 00:08:30,094
Uhh... I don't know.
I should go back.

41
00:08:30,095 --> 00:08:31,095
- Go back where?

42
00:08:37,026 --> 00:08:38,321
Uhh... I have to go,

43
00:08:40,904 --> 00:08:42,363
I can't stay gone.

44
00:08:42,364 --> 00:08:44,776
- No, no,
no. Don't go.
Don't go.

45
00:08:49,864 --> 00:08:51,455
I am sorry for calling.

46
00:08:52,204 --> 00:08:54,293
- Martha! Please, Don't hang
up. Don't hang up the phone.

47
00:08:56,764 --> 00:08:58,189
Do you want me to come get you?

48
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:01,645
I can't wait that long.

49
00:09:01,646 --> 00:09:02,646
- What do you mean?

50
00:09:02,647 --> 00:09:05,630
Tell me where you are
and I'll come right now.

51
00:09:05,631 --> 00:09:06,631
No, It's okay,
you don't have to.

52
00:09:08,526 --> 00:09:10,686
- Martha, I want to see you.
Please.

53
00:09:14,168 --> 00:09:15,517
- Martha?

54
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,437
What's going on?

55
00:09:48,438 --> 00:09:49,438
- Not much.

56
00:09:52,006 --> 00:09:52,948
- Are you alright?
- Yeah.

57
00:09:52,949 --> 00:09:53,949
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

58
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:56,675
- You were really upset on the phone.

59
00:09:57,075 --> 00:09:58,300
- Sorry.
I over reacted.

60
00:09:58,301 --> 00:09:59,301
- To what?

61
00:10:06,117 --> 00:10:07,184
- We got in a fight.

62
00:10:08,717 --> 00:10:09,265
- Who's we?

63
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,150
- Me and this guy.

64
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:16,340
- Your boyfriend?

65
00:10:22,194 --> 00:10:23,219
Did you guys break up?

66
00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:25,720
Yeah.

67
00:10:27,964 --> 00:10:29,661
How long were you together?

68
00:10:31,636 --> 00:10:34,460
- I don't know.
Maybe a year,
more or less.

69
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:38,871
You were here the whole time?

70
00:10:41,234 --> 00:10:44,313
You've been back in New York for over
a year and you haven't called me?

71
00:10:46,009 --> 00:10:47,489
- I'm sorry.

72
00:11:06,388 --> 00:11:06,890
I made you some tea.

73
00:11:06,891 --> 00:11:07,891
Thanks.

74
00:11:14,101 --> 00:11:15,791
You're dripping, everywhere.

75
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:26,129
Ted should be up from the city soon.
He'll make us some dinner.

76
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:27,130
- I'm pretty tired,

77
00:11:28,195 --> 00:11:29,934
Is it okay if I just go to bed?

78
00:11:35,644 --> 00:11:37,856
Get a goodnight sleep tonight,
you'll be as good as new tomorrow.

79
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,282
Well?

80
00:12:24,653 --> 00:12:25,992
She seems okay.

81
00:12:28,387 --> 00:12:30,694
What did she say?

82
00:12:30,695 --> 00:12:31,695
- Not much.

83
00:12:31,182 --> 00:12:32,486
she's really tired.

84
00:12:33,934 --> 00:12:35,126
Where's she been?

85
00:12:36,202 --> 00:12:37,834
She had some boyfriend,

86
00:12:38,297 --> 00:12:39,915
they were living in the Catskills.

87
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:40,916
- What?

88
00:12:40,917 --> 00:12:41,917
It's okay.

89
00:12:42,776 --> 00:12:44,235
- Not really Lucy.

90
00:12:44,236 --> 00:12:46,695
It's fine.
She's here now.

91
00:12:50,071 --> 00:12:52,339
- How long's she gonna be staying again?

92
00:12:54,425 --> 00:12:56,121
I have no idea.

93
00:12:57,056 --> 00:12:58,545
You did a lot of worrying.

94
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,413
I told you,
It will be okay.

95
00:13:08,341 --> 00:13:10,344
Martha!

96
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,776
Welcome!
- Hi.

97
00:13:17,374 --> 00:13:18,635
It's great to finally meet you.

98
00:13:18,636 --> 00:13:19,636
- Yeah.

99
00:13:20,442 --> 00:13:22,568
Did you sleep alright?

100
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:23,569
- Mmhmm.

101
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:24,570
Good.

102
00:13:25,482 --> 00:13:27,039
So, How do you like the house?

103
00:13:27,404 --> 00:13:28,421
It's nice.

104
00:13:31,017 --> 00:13:32,135
It's just a rental.

105
00:13:32,136 --> 00:13:33,136
- Yeah... well,
I love it.

106
00:13:36,795 --> 00:13:38,206
I didn't know there was a lake.

107
00:13:38,637 --> 00:13:39,556
Yeah.

108
00:13:40,929 --> 00:13:42,416
Do you still like to swim?

109
00:13:42,417 --> 00:13:44,770
You don't live in the city?

110
00:13:44,771 --> 00:13:48,781
We do. We just like to come up
here on weekends and holidays.

111
00:13:54,469 --> 00:13:57,132
You know, Ted's working on
this new building down town...

112
00:13:57,769 --> 00:14:00,486
and as soon as its finished,
we're taking one of the new apartments.

113
00:14:00,487 --> 00:14:01,487
You want to see the pictures?

114
00:14:04,505 --> 00:14:05,603
Do you think she's
excited to have you back?

115
00:14:07,628 --> 00:14:09,144
This is just the view,

116
00:14:10,114 --> 00:14:13,297
Obviously, the interiors aren't
finished. But, it's nice right?

117
00:14:15,192 --> 00:14:19,858
Anyway, We were supposed to move in
the spring but construction halted, so,
it'll just be a little while longer.

118
00:14:20,497 --> 00:14:21,964
Just gonna be a little while longer.

119
00:14:21,965 --> 00:14:24,777
Okay, sorry,
no more work talk.

120
00:14:26,891 --> 00:14:28,178
Aren't you hungry?

121
00:14:30,321 --> 00:14:32,278
Not really, sorry.

122
00:14:32,313 --> 00:14:34,030
You have to eat something.

123
00:14:34,492 --> 00:14:35,840
It's okay,
I can make you something later.

124
00:14:47,021 --> 00:14:48,252
Where are we?

125
00:14:49,181 --> 00:14:50,260
Connecticut.

126
00:14:53,978 --> 00:14:55,408
How far are we?

127
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,240
From what?

128
00:14:58,241 --> 00:14:59,241
Yesterday.

129
00:15:02,681 --> 00:15:04,030
You mean where I picked you up?

130
00:15:06,678 --> 00:15:07,984
About 3 hours.
Why?

131
00:15:09,584 --> 00:15:10,757
I was just wondering.

132
00:15:35,586 --> 00:15:36,466
Is that him?

133
00:15:36,467 --> 00:15:37,467
Yeah.

134
00:15:36,876 --> 00:15:37,993
Hey!

135
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:39,810
Is this Martha?

136
00:15:39,811 --> 00:15:40,811
Hi.

137
00:15:41,811 --> 00:15:42,897
How're you doing?

138
00:15:42,898 --> 00:15:43,898
Great.

139
00:15:44,992 --> 00:15:46,640
You've got a really nice place here.

140
00:15:48,312 --> 00:15:49,512
It's as much yours as it is mine.

141
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:52,252
I thought you quit?

142
00:15:52,253 --> 00:15:53,253
I did.

143
00:15:53,856 --> 00:15:54,809
I worry for you.

144
00:15:56,411 --> 00:15:57,542
I know.

145
00:15:59,346 --> 00:16:00,519
I'm sorry.

146
00:16:01,908 --> 00:16:04,153
Don't apologize to me,
it's your body.

147
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,498
Zoe...

148
00:16:10,473 --> 00:16:11,378
Look after this girl.

149
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,901
For once in her life,
she deserves some real care.

150
00:16:15,902 --> 00:16:16,902
- I will.

151
00:16:17,731 --> 00:16:18,856
She's been great.

152
00:16:19,861 --> 00:16:21,443
Everyone's been really great.

153
00:16:24,281 --> 00:16:25,547
Martha.

154
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:29,821
You look like a Marcy May.

155
00:16:30,967 --> 00:16:32,154
Marcy was my grandmothers name.

156
00:16:32,764 --> 00:16:35,349
Well, there you go.

157
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,300
I'm going in.
You want to join?

158
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:45,910
Sure.

159
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,460
You coming?

160
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,320
In a minute.

161
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:39,990
Martha!

162
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,240
Seems an interesting swim wear.

163
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,060
Martha, get out of the water!

164
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:56,040
What?

165
00:17:56,953 --> 00:18:00,459
Get out of the water.
Why aren't you wearing any clothes,
What is wrong with you?

166
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:02,540
You can't do that around here,
you know.

167
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:03,541
- Why?

168
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,511
Because there are kids
around and people come by.

169
00:18:05,512 --> 00:18:06,512
- So?

170
00:18:06,513 --> 00:18:07,513
You just can't.
Get out of the water.

171
00:18:07,514 --> 00:18:09,862
We don't do that kind of thing.
Get out.

172
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,449
You could've just asked me.
I have a bathing suit you can borrow.

173
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,200
What's wrong with you, Jesus?

174
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:47,310
You need to eat.

175
00:18:47,311 --> 00:18:49,545
I will.

176
00:18:50,356 --> 00:18:52,548
I'm just going to sleep
a little more first.

177
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:53,549
Okay.

178
00:18:55,742 --> 00:18:57,725
I'm sorry I got frustrated
with you before.

179
00:18:59,158 --> 00:19:00,372
- It's okay.

180
00:19:03,284 --> 00:19:04,379
Eat.

181
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:36,976
- Hey Marcy.
- Hey Max.

182
00:20:36,977 --> 00:20:38,942
- Where do they go at night?

183
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,540
- I don't know,
I never get invited.

184
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,960
You want to have a drink with me?

185
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:53,019
They won't be back for a few hours.

186
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,020
- I shouldn't.

187
00:20:54,021 --> 00:20:55,021
I'm not going to drink
for awhile actually...

188
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,350
I think it's a good idea for me.

189
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,930
- Alright.

190
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,410
Wake up everybody!

191
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,700
Good Morning.

192
00:22:02,522 --> 00:22:03,702
I'm sorry, Patrick.

193
00:22:03,737 --> 00:22:04,710
- What are you sorry for?

194
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,758
How's everything going so far Marcy May?

195
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:31,759
- Good.

196
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,240
You like it here?

197
00:22:34,736 --> 00:22:36,567
- Yeah, it's great.

198
00:22:36,602 --> 00:22:37,750
I want you to feel at home.

199
00:22:37,751 --> 00:22:38,751
- I do.
Thank You.

200
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,720
I know, People have abandoned you
your whole life. Your father...

201
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:49,659
I don't blame you for
not trusting people.

202
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,050
If you ever want to have
a meaningful relationship,

203
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,240
you need to let your guard down.

204
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:00,430
It's not your fault,
but it's there.

205
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,390
If you feel safe here,
and I hope you do,

206
00:23:05,391 --> 00:23:06,391
let us in.

207
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,640
We just want to help you.

208
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:13,235
Zoe: Yeah,
we think you're fucking awesome.

209
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:15,660
If you're going to live here...

210
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:19,510
You need to be apart of things.

211
00:23:31,555 --> 00:23:33,812
Play another song.

212
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:48,330
How are you feeling today?

213
00:23:48,331 --> 00:23:49,331
Good.

214
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,010
Yeah?

215
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:51,011
Good.

216
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:54,300
So... uh...
I stop by the juice place,

217
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,991
and i got you Kale with ginseng.

218
00:23:56,992 --> 00:23:59,844
Do you mind,
just put your feet off the counter.

219
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:02,190
I got you a Kale in ginseng.

220
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:03,191
Cos it's just...

221
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,510
I thought,
it might make you feel better.

222
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:09,531
If that doesn't looke appealing to you,
I also got a pineapple orange.

223
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:12,197
- Yeah, that might be better.
Thank you.

224
00:24:12,232 --> 00:24:16,393
Oh, I also got you a protein bar
just in case you want a snack.

225
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,370
Why is the house so big?

226
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,660
The house isn't so big.

227
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,626
It's big,
for two people.

228
00:24:30,106 --> 00:24:31,647
Yeah, but we like to entertain.
Sometimes,

229
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:35,202
friends come up for weekends
and sometimes we have parties.

230
00:24:35,203 --> 00:24:36,203
It's just good to have space.

231
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,720
So no one else lives here?

232
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:40,380
Of course,
no one else lives here.

233
00:25:00,173 --> 00:25:00,963
You're married?

234
00:25:00,964 --> 00:25:01,964
Yeah.

235
00:25:03,226 --> 00:25:04,425
When?

236
00:25:04,426 --> 00:25:05,426
April.

237
00:25:07,689 --> 00:25:10,888
I tried to get in touch with
you, but uh... apparently you
got rid of your cell phone?

238
00:25:10,889 --> 00:25:11,889
- I lost it.

239
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:13,460
You didn't think of getting a new one?

240
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:16,469
I got used to not having it.

241
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:18,969
Cocktail anyone?
- No, thank you.

242
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:21,070
Martha?

243
00:25:22,882 --> 00:25:25,960
Was it a big wedding?

244
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:30,094
About forty people.
Mostly Ted's family.

245
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,621
Did Aunt Dora come?
- Yes.

246
00:25:32,622 --> 00:25:35,782
Did she smoke like chimney
and complain about everything.

247
00:25:35,783 --> 00:25:36,783
- She's not that bad.

248
00:25:36,784 --> 00:25:37,784
You didn't need to live with her.

249
00:25:37,785 --> 00:25:38,785
You lived with Dora?

250
00:25:40,393 --> 00:25:41,893
She lived with me after mom died.

251
00:25:41,894 --> 00:25:42,894
Where were you?

252
00:25:42,895 --> 00:25:43,895
College.

253
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,186
I'm sure she'd love to
know that you're okay.

254
00:25:49,187 --> 00:25:51,129
- She hates me.
- She doesn't hate you.

255
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,141
Look at me.

256
00:25:52,142 --> 00:25:55,425
Oh, come on.
I don't have any pictures of you.

257
00:25:58,023 --> 00:25:59,431
You look gorgeous.

258
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:00,830
It's really rather irritating.

259
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:03,170
There you go!

260
00:26:09,535 --> 00:26:12,029
You don't need to shake it,
that's a myth.

261
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:16,821
Is it true married people don't fuck?

262
00:26:17,403 --> 00:26:20,160
What?
No!

263
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:38,743
Put this on.
- You're kidding.

264
00:26:38,744 --> 00:26:41,667
- Martha, your clothes are disgusting,
just try it.
- Why does it matter?

265
00:26:41,668 --> 00:26:45,205
Because It's feels good to put on
something nice and comfortable.

266
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,216
It looks really good you,
you little shit.

267
00:27:07,217 --> 00:27:09,469
- Whatever makes you happy mama bear.

268
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,460
You're making fun of me and
I think it looks really good.

269
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,360
She seems better today.

270
00:27:26,361 --> 00:27:27,361
Yeah.

271
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,320
I wish I didn't have to go tomorrow.

272
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,230
Let me take you.

273
00:27:32,231 --> 00:27:33,231
No,

274
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:35,710
I don't want to leave her alone.

275
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,750
You'll be nice to her right?

276
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,670
I'm always nice.

277
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,870
I know you feel like something
bad just happened with you.

278
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:51,703
but you have to trust me,
it was not bad,

279
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,340
That was truly good.

280
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:58,310
We've all been in this situation,

281
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:05,521
and we wouldn't all still be here if
what happened in that room was bad.

282
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,490
We all love each other very much,

283
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,800
we are all together on this,

284
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,380
you have to trust us.

285
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,830
Do you believe me?

286
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:43,980
You're so lucky,

287
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:50,538
I'd give anything to
have my first time again.

288
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:51,539
- Really?

289
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:55,151
Yeah, it's so special.

290
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,120
I can't remember anything,

291
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:01,050
I just...

292
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:04,430
woke up and felt this pain.

293
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,290
That's the cleansing.

294
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,800
It's good. It means it's working
if you can't remember things.

295
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:16,245
You're cleansing yourself
of the past and the toxins.

296
00:30:19,463 --> 00:30:21,970
You need to share yourself,
don't be selfish.

297
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:23,840
- I'm not.

298
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,040
So smile then,

299
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:32,020
enjoy this amazing night.
It only happens once.

300
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:43,550
KATIE: We switch off jobs each day...

301
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:45,900
so we all know how to
do different things.

302
00:30:47,835 --> 00:30:48,796
Do you knit?

303
00:30:48,797 --> 00:30:50,330
No, I can learn though.

304
00:30:50,365 --> 00:30:53,452
Oh no, that's okay,
you'll find your role.

305
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,600
It takes time for people
to find their role...

306
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:57,160
in a new family.

307
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,985
Mostly, We sell blankets in town.

308
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,500
'Cos, We still need some money,

309
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:06,680
but when the farm's up and running
we'll be self sufficient...

310
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:10,086
and we'll never have to
worry about it again.

311
00:31:10,087 --> 00:31:11,087
but...

312
00:31:11,841 --> 00:31:14,923
It's hard to get machinery
and live stock without cash.

313
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:17,500
- When do you think that'll happen?

314
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,120
Well, Hopefully by the end of the summer

315
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,560
but we'll see.

316
00:31:22,561 --> 00:31:23,561
- That'll be nice.

317
00:31:23,562 --> 00:31:27,110
No, it's not nice,
It's essential.

318
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:30,926
We need to be able to
survive out here on our own.

319
00:31:30,927 --> 00:31:33,531
The Government can't
keep bailing people out.

320
00:31:33,566 --> 00:31:34,950
Businesses will close
and people will starve.

321
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:38,460
- Do you actually think,
that's gonna happen?

322
00:31:38,461 --> 00:31:39,461
Yeah.

323
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,642
It's inevitable.

324
00:31:40,643 --> 00:31:42,776
People can't keep on living like this.

325
00:31:42,777 --> 00:31:43,777
It's unnatural.

326
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,029
Is that a new song?

327
00:32:18,064 --> 00:32:19,806
Yeah, I wrote it yesterday.

328
00:32:19,807 --> 00:32:20,807
That's really great,

329
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,050
that's nice.
- Thanks man.

330
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,577
Alright, This is called Marcy's song.

331
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:54,279
?
Well she,

332
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,549
?
she's just a picture.

333
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,719
?
Who lives on my wall.

334
00:33:05,147 --> 00:33:10,935
? Well she, she's just a picture

335
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:17,194
? And the reason, reason,
reason it is so small.

336
00:33:18,815 --> 00:33:21,314
?
With a smile so inviting

337
00:33:21,315 --> 00:33:25,610
?
and a body so tall,

338
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,419
?
Well, she's just a picture

339
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,419
?
Just a picture

340
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:35,919
?
That's all.

341
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:43,989
?
Well you stand there,

342
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:46,489
?
stand there with the nightshade,

343
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:49,074
?
Her dripping

344
00:33:49,075 --> 00:33:54,185
?
ripping down your hands

345
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:58,109
?
And you ask me,

346
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:02,015
?
ask me about the lightning

347
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:04,759
?
And the lady, lady, lady

348
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:07,259
?
she understands,

349
00:34:09,027 --> 00:34:11,785
?
It's a dream for the future

350
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,759
?
and the water for the sands

351
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,439
?
And the strangeness

352
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,939
?
is wandering

353
00:34:22,369 --> 00:34:27,361
?
Through many callin' lands?

354
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:05,270
TED on phone: I'm going into this
meeting in fourteen fucking days!

355
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:09,538
Great, that's all I wanted to hear,

356
00:35:09,539 --> 00:35:10,539
Thank you.

357
00:35:15,944 --> 00:35:16,947
What are you doing?

358
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:17,948
Cleaning.

359
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:20,510
I thought I'd help out more.

360
00:35:22,936 --> 00:35:24,183
Alright.

361
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:27,790
I'm going to take the boat out,
do you want to come?

362
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:30,722
Is Lucy coming?

363
00:35:30,723 --> 00:35:33,396
No, She had to run to the city.

364
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:38,630
Come on,
I'll teach you how to drive the boat.

365
00:35:41,374 --> 00:35:42,293
It's okay.

366
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,960
Come on.

367
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,350
You want one?

368
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,580
How have things been with you and Lucy?

369
00:37:01,581 --> 00:37:04,011
Fine.

370
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,110
Is it strange to spend time together?

371
00:37:05,111 --> 00:37:07,246
No.
Why?

372
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:09,540
It's been a long time.

373
00:37:11,219 --> 00:37:12,768
I don't know,
it's normal I guess.

374
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,160
Where is she?

375
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:18,450
She's at the doctor.

376
00:37:18,451 --> 00:37:19,451
Why?

377
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:23,830
We're trying to have a baby.

378
00:37:29,354 --> 00:37:30,234
What?

379
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:34,085
I just can't imagine it,
Lucy holding a baby.

380
00:37:34,086 --> 00:37:35,086
Why?

381
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:36,330
She wouldn't know what to do with it.

382
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:41,860
Do you want a baby?

383
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:48,090
If she's happy,
I'm happy.

384
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:50,340
So you're unhappy!

385
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,680
What now?

386
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:56,890
No, no,
no... she's doing well.

387
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:58,570
She's doing well.

388
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:01,300
Do you want another?

389
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:08,990
She's relieved to have you back.

390
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,040
You worried her.

391
00:38:12,041 --> 00:38:13,041
Why?

392
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:18,110
Cos you disappeared.
You haven't called in two years!

393
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:23,330
I just lost track I guess.

394
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:26,460
It's good to let people
know where you are Martha.

395
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,350
People worry.

396
00:38:29,351 --> 00:38:32,207
I didn't think Lucy
would worry about me.

397
00:38:32,208 --> 00:38:33,208
Well, she did.

398
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,090
Can I go swimming?

399
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,450
You don't need to ask.

400
00:38:43,451 --> 00:38:44,451
What are you watching?

401
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,240
- Football.

402
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,020
- (Mimicking Ted) Football.

403
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,470
Who do you want to win?

404
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:04,210
Chelsea.

405
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:34,150
It's amazing, right?

406
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,240
Do you want it?

407
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,440
Not if it makes you feel weird.

408
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,810
It's yours if you want it.

409
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:55,140
What about this three...
as a set?

410
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:58,120
Do you think they go well together?

411
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:01,470
You took them?

412
00:42:01,471 --> 00:42:02,471
- Yeah.

413
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,880
They're really nice, Lucy.

414
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:13,910
Jesus Christ!

415
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:16,920
Martha, what are you doing?

416
00:43:16,921 --> 00:43:17,921
Nothing!

417
00:43:19,605 --> 00:43:22,037
Jesus, you can't just come in like that.

418
00:43:22,038 --> 00:43:23,038
Sorry.

419
00:43:24,245 --> 00:43:26,063
God damn it,
what's wrong?

420
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:27,430
I'm just having a hard time,
sleeping alone.

421
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:29,340
But all you do is sleep.

422
00:43:29,341 --> 00:43:30,341
Christ!

423
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:35,482
Just stay, Stay.

424
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:38,330
Why would you think it was
okay to come in like that?

425
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,100
I don't know. It's a big bed,
you guys were on the other side.

426
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:44,320
You can't come into our
room when we're having sex,

427
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:47,340
that's not normal!
It's private.

428
00:43:47,341 --> 00:43:48,341
- Sorry.

429
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,020
You don't need to apologize,
I just...

430
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:54,980
I need you to understand
why it's not okay.

431
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,270
Do you?

432
00:43:57,271 --> 00:43:58,271
- Yeah.

433
00:43:57,670 --> 00:43:59,606
Well?

434
00:44:00,432 --> 00:44:02,893
Because it's private and not normal.

435
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:11,470
Just lie down Martha.

436
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:14,920
Oh God!
This is just brilliant!

437
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:24,274
Just go to sleep.

438
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:39,351
I'm sorry you slept out here.

439
00:45:40,357 --> 00:45:41,850
Thank you for being patient.

440
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:43,540
I didn't have much choice,
Did I?

441
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:55,560
I have two weeks a year to
come out here and try to relax,

442
00:45:55,561 --> 00:45:56,561
I know.

443
00:45:56,210 --> 00:45:59,627
I am under so much pressure right now.
- I know you are.

444
00:45:59,628 --> 00:46:01,962
..to get this building up and
running or the bank takes it.

445
00:46:01,963 --> 00:46:02,963
That has nothing to do with Martha.

446
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:05,570
My point is,
I don't need the extra stress.

447
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:09,590
I'm her only family.

448
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:14,564
She needs to know that she
can depend on me right now.

449
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:16,033
It's complicated.

450
00:46:16,034 --> 00:46:18,898
As complicated as it might be,
we can't ignore the fact that...

451
00:46:18,899 --> 00:46:21,178
her behavior is fucking insane.

452
00:46:34,659 --> 00:46:35,698
I'm sorry.

453
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:13,977
Do you ever hear things
hitting the roof at night?

454
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:15,980
No.

455
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:24,420
Where did you pick up gardening?

456
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:27,230
There was a garden where I lived?

457
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:29,380
You're good.

458
00:47:29,870 --> 00:47:31,300
I'm good at some things.

459
00:47:31,301 --> 00:47:32,301
I know you are.

460
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:41,670
Was he ever physical with you?

461
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:44,370
Who?
- Your boyfriend.

462
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,240
What do you mean?

463
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:48,090
Did he ever,
hit you?

464
00:47:48,091 --> 00:47:49,091
- No.

465
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:55,780
You had a bruised ear,
when you called me you were hysterical.

466
00:47:55,781 --> 00:47:58,420
- I never noticed.

467
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:00,900
Are you sure he didn't hit you?

468
00:48:00,901 --> 00:48:01,901
Yeah.

469
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:04,370
You can tell me.

470
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:06,300
He never hit me.

471
00:48:09,530 --> 00:48:11,659
I wish you felt more
comfortable talking to me.

472
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:12,660
- I do.
- So, talk!

473
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:18,060
I had a boyfriend,
he lied to me,

474
00:48:18,650 --> 00:48:19,910
I left.
That's it.

475
00:48:21,990 --> 00:48:22,870
Not everything doesn't
have to be a big deal.

476
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:30,701
I'm still your big sister, you
know. I get to ask you questions.

477
00:48:30,702 --> 00:48:31,702
That's fine.

478
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,542
And I'll beat someone's ass
if they are mean to you.

479
00:48:33,543 --> 00:48:35,629
I don't think you can beat anyone's ass.

480
00:48:35,664 --> 00:48:37,788
Maybe not,
but i'd like to try.

481
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:53,480
Hey... Don't stare!

482
00:49:12,932 --> 00:49:13,750
You okay?
- Yeah.

483
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:19,370
He's right.
I don't know why I'm so weak.

484
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,120
You're not.
You'll quit.

485
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,329
Who's that?

486
00:50:10,323 --> 00:50:12,181
Her name's Sarah I think.

487
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:14,900
You should handle her.

488
00:50:16,503 --> 00:50:17,816
- You think?
- Yeah. You're ready.

489
00:50:19,030 --> 00:50:20,510
Zoe could help but you'll be great.

490
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:45,010
We share all of this,
if it fits,
you can wear it.

491
00:50:45,011 --> 00:50:46,011
Cool.

492
00:50:52,902 --> 00:50:54,700
And this is where we sleep.

493
00:50:55,870 --> 00:50:56,990
You can take any bed that's open

494
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:59,100
or you can sleep downstairs.

495
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:07,317
I'm hungry,
can we eat?

496
00:51:07,318 --> 00:51:08,318
We don't eat until the evening.

497
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:09,319
- Really?

498
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,830
You'll get used to it.

499
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,780
Your body doesn't need that much food.

500
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:18,070
He's beautiful.

501
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:21,410
Whose the mother?

502
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:22,411
Katie.

503
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:24,200
but we all help out.

504
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:29,330
Is Patrick the father?

505
00:51:29,331 --> 00:51:30,331
Uh huh.

506
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:32,000
Looks just like him.

507
00:51:38,550 --> 00:51:39,620
All the kids here are boys?

508
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:41,530
He only has boys.

509
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:46,201
You're good with him.

510
00:51:46,202 --> 00:51:47,202
Do you want to hold him?

511
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,650
I don't have to take care of them do I?

512
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:53,651
Not if you don't want to.

513
00:51:54,510 --> 00:51:56,010
There are plenty of jobs you can do.

514
00:51:57,270 --> 00:51:58,630
You'll find your role.

515
00:52:00,210 --> 00:52:02,480
It takes time for to find their
role in a new family... huh?

516
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,160
I called my dad today to ask for money.

517
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:13,880
Does Patrick know?

518
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:15,780
Yeah, He asked me to.

519
00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:20,409
Sometimes, if there's something
we really need I'll call.

520
00:52:20,410 --> 00:52:21,410
How was it?

521
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:24,766
Fine, they're not bad people.

522
00:52:24,767 --> 00:52:25,767
Did he give you the money?

523
00:52:25,768 --> 00:52:29,703
Yeah.
He thinks I'm on drugs.

524
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:32,439
Did you tell him that you're not?

525
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,632
No, that's why he gives it to me.

526
00:52:33,633 --> 00:52:37,380
I guess he'd rather pay for it
than think I'm sucking dick for it.

527
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:40,110
I've done drugs.

528
00:52:41,070 --> 00:52:42,030
Not a lot...

529
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,400
but I've tried pretty
much, everything...

530
00:52:45,890 --> 00:52:47,160
except heroin.

531
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:50,060
It's good to try everything at least
once. You find out who you are that way.

532
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:53,020
What about drinking,
do you drink?

533
00:52:53,021 --> 00:52:54,021
No.

534
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:56,620
I have,
but I don't.

535
00:52:56,655 --> 00:52:57,990
Good, we don't drink.

536
00:52:58,410 --> 00:52:59,950
It just makes you
angry and less focused.

537
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:03,805
Don't get the wrong idea Sarah. We
don't really talk to our old families.

538
00:53:03,806 --> 00:53:04,806
- I wouldn't call my Dad anyway.

539
00:53:07,052 --> 00:53:07,998
Hey.

540
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:10,990
Have you met Sarah?

541
00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:12,540
Sally, yeah.

542
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:25,060
That's enough.

543
00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:37,360
Half is fine.

544
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:03,970
Excuse me.

545
00:54:08,350 --> 00:54:10,960
I can finish this,
if you want to go to bed.

546
00:54:10,961 --> 00:54:11,961
- I don't mind.

547
00:54:11,962 --> 00:54:12,962
Why don't you get some sleep.

548
00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:37,010
Oh, hi.

549
00:54:37,570 --> 00:54:39,420
Hi.

550
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:47,030
What do I have to do?

551
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:49,830
Nothing you don't want to.

552
00:54:52,389 --> 00:54:54,081
Drink this,
it will help you relax.

553
00:54:54,116 --> 00:54:56,640
Thanks.

554
00:54:57,260 --> 00:55:00,040
It's herbal.
It starts the cleansing.

555
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:07,190
We've all done it so there's
nothing to worry about.

556
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:24,430
Do I have to wear this robe?

557
00:55:24,431 --> 00:55:27,168
I know it seems a bit silly,

558
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:28,750
but it's a part of it.

559
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:36,710
You look amazing.

560
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:39,021
Thanks.

561
00:55:39,022 --> 00:55:40,022
It's your special night with him,

562
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:43,090
enjoy it,

563
00:55:43,990 --> 00:55:47,690
you'll be great.

564
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:28,820
Shouldn't we start cooking?

565
00:57:29,350 --> 00:57:31,050
I just made some potato salad.

566
00:57:31,790 --> 00:57:32,850
And Ted's cooking the fish.

567
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:34,966
I thought we were going to cook.

568
00:57:34,967 --> 00:57:35,967
We cooked last night.

569
00:57:36,570 --> 00:57:37,500
Oh, yeah.

570
00:57:44,370 --> 00:57:46,090
Do you ever have that feeling
where you can't tell if...

571
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:50,466
something's a memory or if
it's something you've dreamed?

572
00:57:52,990 --> 00:57:54,940
Not really.

573
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:06,600
Do you blame me for anything?

574
00:58:06,601 --> 00:58:07,601
No.

575
00:58:11,006 --> 00:58:12,113
Like what?

576
00:58:13,010 --> 00:58:14,210
I don't know.

577
00:58:15,350 --> 00:58:16,830
I'm just trying to figure
out why we stopped talking.

578
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:18,670
I didn't think about it.

579
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:21,090
Really?

580
00:58:21,091 --> 00:58:22,091
We were far apart.

581
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:29,880
Sometimes I wonder

582
00:58:31,650 --> 00:58:33,780
if, maybe I could have
taken better care of you.

583
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:35,630
- The past doesn't matter.
- It does matter.

584
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:39,420
I took care of myself.

585
00:58:39,421 --> 00:58:40,421
I know you did.

586
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:43,210
Sometimes, I think I could
have done more though.

587
00:58:43,211 --> 00:58:44,211
Stop.

588
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:52,170
You really never think about it?

589
00:58:52,171 --> 00:58:53,171
No.

590
00:58:55,450 --> 00:58:56,562
You're not angry at me?

591
00:58:56,563 --> 00:58:57,563
I know you don't think much of me.

592
00:58:57,564 --> 00:59:00,994
but I knew what I was
doing then and I still do.

593
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:03,570
No, Martha,
I think the world of you.

594
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:07,740
Sometimes, i just think
I should have come home.

595
00:59:08,450 --> 00:59:12,230
And make sure you went to college,
you had so much potential.

596
00:59:12,231 --> 00:59:14,952
- I don't need your guidance now.
And I didn't then...

597
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:17,030
I'm a teacher and a leader,
you just...

598
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:22,025
never let me be that but now
I know I am, I know who I am.

599
00:59:23,950 --> 00:59:25,830
Teacher and a leader?

600
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:28,630
What are you talking about?

601
00:59:29,630 --> 00:59:31,060
I always...

602
00:59:32,510 --> 00:59:33,790
I was the one who encouraged you,

603
00:59:34,910 --> 00:59:37,880
To push yourself, always.
but you're the one who shut me out.

604
00:59:41,490 --> 00:59:42,207
Martha.

605
00:59:42,208 --> 00:59:46,873
Just because we're sisters doesn't
mean we need to alk about everything
that comes into your head.

606
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:07,460
Come on,
don't be rude.

607
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:13,600
Are you coming?

608
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:32,440
So what are your plans Martha?

609
01:00:35,306 --> 01:00:36,245
For what?

610
01:00:38,130 --> 01:00:39,000
Life.

611
01:00:39,930 --> 01:00:40,910
I don't know.

612
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:45,140
Are you thinking about
what you can do for job?

613
01:00:47,586 --> 01:00:48,625
No.

614
01:00:51,570 --> 01:00:56,398
You're at an age where you need to
start thinking about a proper career.

615
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:57,910
Why?

616
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:01,010
It's a part of adult life.

617
01:01:03,010 --> 01:01:04,480
There are other ways to live.

618
01:01:05,610 --> 01:01:06,460
Really?

619
01:01:08,135 --> 01:01:09,237
Sure.

620
01:01:09,272 --> 01:01:09,970
Like what?

621
01:01:10,930 --> 01:01:11,980
I don't know.

622
01:01:14,610 --> 01:01:16,930
People don't need careers,
people should just exist.

623
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:22,700
He's just saying we should
start talking about...

624
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:27,243
what you're interested in.
Maybe we can help you get some ideas...

625
01:01:27,244 --> 01:01:28,244
That we can put together.

626
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:30,250
There are moments in my life,
When I would love to just,

627
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:32,487
go to France and just exist.

628
01:01:32,488 --> 01:01:34,369
- You can do that if you want to.

629
01:01:34,370 --> 01:01:36,587
It's not that simple.

630
01:01:38,450 --> 01:01:39,620
Yeah, It's not your fault but...

631
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:42,010
you learned to measure success...

632
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,810
by money and possessions.

633
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:48,280
It's just not the right way to live.

634
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:53,460
- not the right way to live?

635
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:01,530
And what is the right
way to live exactly?

636
01:02:03,190 --> 01:02:04,300
Martha, What is the right way to live?

637
01:02:06,450 --> 01:02:08,949
Is it, vanishing off from
the face of the earth,

638
01:02:08,950 --> 01:02:12,268
and not calling your family
for two years, untill they're
worried sick about you...

639
01:02:12,269 --> 01:02:13,269
Is that the right way to live?

640
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:16,048
or is it, I don't know,
living without posessions...

641
01:02:16,049 --> 01:02:18,917
until you actually need someone
and turning up on our doorstep,

642
01:02:18,952 --> 01:02:21,380
Where you know you can get some.
Is it the right way to live?

643
01:02:22,510 --> 01:02:25,009
You sit there lecturing us
about our lives, and so far...

644
01:02:25,010 --> 01:02:27,509
I have not witness one side that
you have any values of your own.

645
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:30,830
You should remember that Martha,
you're under my roof...

646
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:34,380
and you're eating my food,
you should watch your mouth...

647
01:02:34,381 --> 01:02:35,381
because you are rude!

648
01:02:35,382 --> 01:02:36,382
- You don't know anything about it!

649
01:03:49,754 --> 01:03:53,139
Hello... Hello.

650
01:03:54,446 --> 01:03:55,564
Who's this?

651
01:03:59,031 --> 01:03:59,981
Zoe?

652
01:03:59,982 --> 01:04:02,291
Is she not there?

653
01:04:03,190 --> 01:04:04,474
She's not.

654
01:04:06,410 --> 01:04:07,280
Where is she?

655
01:04:09,752 --> 01:04:10,961
Who is this?

656
01:10:14,481 --> 01:10:16,020
Okay, my turn.

657
01:10:26,184 --> 01:10:28,513
Alright Max,
was this just an excuse to grope Marcy.

658
01:10:28,548 --> 01:10:29,910
I'm teaching her how to shoot.

659
01:10:30,890 --> 01:10:36,333
and then you just squeeeeeeeeeze.

660
01:10:37,050 --> 01:10:38,540
Hey, Patrick.
- Hey.

661
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:41,890
Focus.

662
01:10:44,530 --> 01:10:45,760
Take a deep breath.

663
01:10:48,250 --> 01:10:50,190
Feel the tension leaving your
stomach and over to your hand.

664
01:10:52,150 --> 01:10:53,330
Think of someone who hurt you.

665
01:10:54,060 --> 01:10:55,750
Lied to you,
feel it.

666
01:10:57,140 --> 01:10:58,260
Feel it,
feel how they made you feel.

667
01:10:59,490 --> 01:11:00,700
Let it build.

668
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:03,420
Let it transfer to the gun.

669
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:06,040
building in the gun.

670
01:11:08,429 --> 01:11:09,940
Breathe out,

671
01:11:09,941 --> 01:11:10,941
Now release.

672
01:11:16,070 --> 01:11:17,440
Feels good right?

673
01:11:17,441 --> 01:11:18,441
- Yeah.

674
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:20,943
Now try that.

675
01:11:20,944 --> 01:11:21,944
What do you mean?

676
01:11:21,945 --> 01:11:22,945
Shoot it.

677
01:11:24,390 --> 01:11:26,290
They're living animals.

678
01:11:26,993 --> 01:11:28,313
So, shoot Max then.

679
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:45,127
Fuck this.

680
01:11:46,383 --> 01:11:47,971
Don't walk away from me Max.

681
01:11:51,670 --> 01:11:52,770
The cat has terminal cancer,

682
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:55,860
it's in excruciating pain.

683
01:11:55,861 --> 01:11:56,861
- I can't.

684
01:11:57,510 --> 01:11:58,700
Max has no substance,

685
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:02,210
he's just here to free load and be
around the girls but you're different.

686
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:05,400
you're a teacher and leader,

687
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:09,292
You don't see it because no one
let you believe it before me.

688
01:12:09,293 --> 01:12:10,293
You're a teacher...

689
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:11,710
and a leader Marcy,
now prove it.

690
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:17,380
The cat reminds you of some fluffy
thing you think you used to love...

691
01:12:18,690 --> 01:12:20,280
misguided emotions.

692
01:12:25,340 --> 01:12:26,370
I could spend my life being selfish,

693
01:12:27,990 --> 01:12:32,650
living alone, using this gift for
me but I've sacrificed in order
to be what you need me to be.

694
01:12:34,070 --> 01:12:34,951
Why don't you trust me?

695
01:12:34,952 --> 01:12:35,952
- I do trust you.

696
01:12:35,953 --> 01:12:36,953
Then you shouldn't need
me to explain everything.

697
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:46,960
Why did you do that?

698
01:12:48,270 --> 01:12:49,540
You said it was sick.

699
01:12:51,140 --> 01:12:54,951
One of them was sick,
Zoe knew which one it was!

700
01:18:01,620 --> 01:18:02,760
Just do it already!

701
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:43,450
Jesus Christ!
God...

702
01:18:46,070 --> 01:18:47,370
God!
you scared me.

703
01:18:47,371 --> 01:18:48,371
Sorry.

704
01:18:50,290 --> 01:18:51,500
Did I wake you?

705
01:18:54,857 --> 01:18:56,410
No.
I can't sleep.

706
01:18:56,445 --> 01:18:57,190
Me neither.

707
01:19:02,030 --> 01:19:03,680
I was going to watch a movie.
You want to watch?

708
01:19:06,735 --> 01:19:08,465
- I should try to sleep.

709
01:19:08,910 --> 01:19:10,170
It always helps me.

710
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:14,210
It's better than lying in bed awake.

711
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:47,810
Should I get some breakfast?

712
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:53,860
Hey!

713
01:22:01,660 --> 01:22:02,860
Press them together.

714
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:19,460
I think that's better.

715
01:22:31,940 --> 01:22:33,410
You look really pretty.

716
01:22:35,001 --> 01:22:36,295
- Thanks.

717
01:24:12,350 --> 01:24:13,470
What's you name?

718
01:24:14,570 --> 01:24:15,530
- I'm sorry?

719
01:24:17,321 --> 01:24:18,788
What's you name?

720
01:24:18,823 --> 01:24:20,480
- I'm Mike.

721
01:24:25,150 --> 01:24:26,680
Can I get you something to drink?

722
01:24:30,635 --> 01:24:32,511
I used to drink this.

723
01:24:34,111 --> 01:24:35,279
- Straight?

724
01:24:37,490 --> 01:24:39,800
I thought you weren't
supposed to drink Mike.

725
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:45,650
- I'm not drinking.

726
01:24:51,066 --> 01:24:52,610
You think you're so fucking smart.

727
01:25:02,350 --> 01:25:04,559
Hey, what is going on?

728
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:05,560
He's a fucking liar.

729
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:07,490
We have to leave.

730
01:25:08,670 --> 01:25:11,110
No, we all have to leave.
I know him.

731
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:17,330
No, no, no... We all have to leave.
You don't wanna live with this.

732
01:25:20,530 --> 01:25:22,192
Martha, What is wrong with you?

733
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:25,960
He's fucking here!

734
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:28,150
Stop touching me,
You're not listening to me!

735
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:31,410
Take a deep breathe,

736
01:25:32,580 --> 01:25:35,440
Take a deep breathe,

737
01:25:36,120 --> 01:25:37,710
Martha, Take a deep breathe.

738
01:25:39,010 --> 01:25:40,419
What is going on?

739
01:25:40,420 --> 01:25:41,420
I have no idea.

740
01:25:48,370 --> 01:25:49,690
Martha please try to breath.

741
01:25:51,130 --> 01:25:52,400
please try to breathe.

742
01:25:52,850 --> 01:25:54,160
Can you tell me what
you're talking about?

743
01:25:54,670 --> 01:25:56,090
I don't know what you're talking about.

744
01:26:05,420 --> 01:26:11,870
Please try to breathe.

745
01:26:13,860 --> 01:26:14,870
okay.

746
01:26:17,550 --> 01:26:18,980
Take a breathe.

747
01:26:19,290 --> 01:26:22,210
Swallow.

748
01:27:59,207 --> 01:28:00,251
What the fuck.

749
01:28:02,319 --> 01:28:03,999
Hey, we can go.

750
01:28:06,270 --> 01:28:07,310
What do you want?

751
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:09,620
Nothing.

752
01:28:12,490 --> 01:28:13,930
No need for that!

753
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:16,130
Uhmm... we are leaving now.

754
01:28:17,290 --> 01:28:18,940
So, come on guys.

755
01:28:23,300 --> 01:28:24,210
Sorry.

756
01:28:26,310 --> 01:28:29,600
Jesus Christ!

757
01:28:29,601 --> 01:28:30,601
Calm down.

758
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:33,760
If you calm down no one will get hurt.

759
01:28:37,869 --> 01:28:38,915
What do you want?

760
01:28:39,230 --> 01:28:40,490
We don't want anything.

761
01:28:44,280 --> 01:28:45,490
Just get out.

762
01:28:45,491 --> 01:28:46,491
We're just looking at the house.
It's nice.

763
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:49,449
We wouldn't have come in,
if we think you were here.

764
01:28:51,464 --> 01:28:52,961
Just Leave.

765
01:28:52,996 --> 01:28:56,556
I would but I can't be sure
you won't call the police.

766
01:28:58,838 --> 01:29:00,073
I won't.

767
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:01,160
You didn't take anything...

768
01:29:04,015 --> 01:29:05,900
so just go,

769
01:29:10,526 --> 01:29:12,696
I just wanna make sure
my family to be safe.

770
01:29:12,697 --> 01:29:13,697
- Safe?

771
01:29:14,550 --> 01:29:16,190
Why wouldn't anyone be safe.

772
01:29:17,330 --> 01:29:18,690
Unless you call the police,
everything will be fine.

773
01:29:23,160 --> 01:29:24,060
I won't.

774
01:29:25,180 --> 01:29:26,100
I give you my word,

775
01:29:27,210 --> 01:29:28,290
So, please go.

776
01:29:35,430 --> 01:29:36,490
Get the fuck out of my house.

777
01:29:59,340 --> 01:30:00,913
Marcy, go now.

778
01:31:14,840 --> 01:31:16,300
I made you something to eat.

779
01:31:20,104 --> 01:31:22,406
It's too hot,
let it cool for a minute okay.

780
01:31:33,170 --> 01:31:34,690
I'm sorry I ruined the party.

781
01:31:37,801 --> 01:31:39,715
You didn't ruin the party,
it's fine.

782
01:31:43,144 --> 01:31:44,491
Is it over?

783
01:31:47,054 --> 01:31:48,853
Yes, you slept through the night.

784
01:31:49,110 --> 01:31:49,970
That's good.

785
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:58,010
Do you wanna try and
sit up to drink the tea?

786
01:32:01,820 --> 01:32:02,810
I don't need it.

787
01:32:22,700 --> 01:32:24,840
You okay?

788
01:32:24,841 --> 01:32:25,841
- Uh huh.

789
01:32:29,460 --> 01:32:30,990
We are working hard to create
something special here.

790
01:32:34,010 --> 01:32:35,210
Do you feel that?

791
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:39,910
You'd be willing to throw it away?

792
01:32:39,911 --> 01:32:40,911
- No.

793
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:43,940
Then, you understand why this happened?

794
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:57,584
You know that death is the most
beautiful part of life, right?

795
01:33:00,940 --> 01:33:03,430
Death is beautiful
because we all fear death.

796
01:33:07,730 --> 01:33:08,790
And fear...

797
01:33:09,690 --> 01:33:13,260
is the most amazing emotion of all
because it creates complete awareness.

798
01:33:15,990 --> 01:33:19,567
When you're scared it forces you
to be completely aware of your...

799
01:33:19,568 --> 01:33:21,897
surroundings and the moment you're in.

800
01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:24,400
It brings you to NOW...

801
01:33:28,090 --> 01:33:29,530
and that makes you truly present.

802
01:33:33,190 --> 01:33:36,744
And when you are truly present,
that's nirvana,

803
01:33:36,950 --> 01:33:38,420
that's pure love.

804
01:33:41,250 --> 01:33:45,064
So, death is pure love.

805
01:33:56,330 --> 01:33:57,280
Hello?

806
01:33:57,281 --> 01:33:59,356
- Hi, is Watts there?

807
01:33:59,580 --> 01:34:00,660
Who's this?

808
01:34:00,661 --> 01:34:03,743
- Jane.
Is Watts there?

809
01:34:04,440 --> 01:34:05,830
Can I help you?

810
01:34:05,831 --> 01:34:06,831
- Who's this?

811
01:34:08,060 --> 01:34:11,170
Marlene Lewis.
What's your last name Jane.

812
01:34:11,171 --> 01:34:14,126
- Heller, sorry,
do I have the right number?

813
01:34:14,161 --> 01:34:15,320
I don't know,
do you?

814
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:18,010
It's a Jane.

815
01:34:18,011 --> 01:34:19,011
- What?

816
01:34:18,650 --> 01:34:19,690
Jane.

817
01:34:20,500 --> 01:34:22,400
Hello.

818
01:34:23,430 --> 01:34:24,860
Hey.
How are you?

819
01:34:27,420 --> 01:34:29,560
Sure, let's do it,
I'll be around there on Friday.

820
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:33,590
No, that was my cousin Marcy,

821
01:34:35,980 --> 01:34:37,230
Okay, sure.

822
01:34:39,270 --> 01:34:42,050
Alright, I'll see you then.
I'm glad you called.

823
01:34:43,810 --> 01:34:45,070
Alright, Bye.

824
01:35:11,020 --> 01:35:12,060
Marcy.

825
01:35:13,190 --> 01:35:14,770
You don't eat until they're finished.

826
01:35:16,750 --> 01:35:17,730
You know better.

827
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:21,360
I know, Sorry... Katie.

828
01:35:22,940 --> 01:35:24,120
LUCY: Who's Katie?

829
01:35:26,415 --> 01:35:27,206
What?

830
01:35:27,570 --> 01:35:28,910
Who's Katie?

831
01:35:30,573 --> 01:35:32,076
Oh, nothing.

832
01:35:42,330 --> 01:35:43,320
Lucy?

833
01:35:44,070 --> 01:35:44,970
Yeah.

834
01:35:45,490 --> 01:35:46,610
Is this...

835
01:35:47,900 --> 01:35:49,260
from the past or is this now?

836
01:35:51,734 --> 01:35:52,766
What?

837
01:35:53,870 --> 01:35:55,040
I don't remember waking up this morning.

838
01:36:01,870 --> 01:36:03,260
Why don't you go sit down,
I'll finish this.

839
01:36:31,190 --> 01:36:32,427
What's going on?

840
01:36:33,077 --> 01:36:34,510
Who the fuck knows.

841
01:36:38,970 --> 01:36:40,220
She needs to see someone.

842
01:36:41,120 --> 01:36:42,180
I know.

843
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:44,700
I'll start looking into places tomorrow.

844
01:36:46,430 --> 01:36:47,500
Places?

845
01:36:49,910 --> 01:36:52,175
I don't think she should
stay with us anymore.

846
01:36:57,374 --> 01:36:59,670
We can't do anything for
her when she's like this.

847
01:37:01,260 --> 01:37:02,410
I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Okay?

848
01:37:11,820 --> 01:37:12,850
Zoe?

849
01:37:16,190 --> 01:37:17,130
Yeah.

850
01:37:22,410 --> 01:37:24,170
I can't stop thinking about that man.

851
01:37:28,490 --> 01:37:29,670
I know.

852
01:37:35,680 --> 01:37:36,900
It happens though,

853
01:37:41,990 --> 01:37:43,190
we're never really dead or alive,

854
01:37:43,970 --> 01:37:45,320
we just exist,

855
01:37:46,830 --> 01:37:48,620
so he's still existing,
but it's in a parallel time.

856
01:37:49,770 --> 01:37:50,970
Just don't think about it.

857
01:38:38,431 --> 01:38:39,742
It's Zoe,
can we talk?

858
01:38:45,593 --> 01:38:46,863
Can you let me in?

859
01:39:04,440 --> 01:39:05,640
- Haven't you learned anything?
- I have.

860
01:39:06,180 --> 01:39:08,670
I felt like we had a connection.

861
01:39:08,671 --> 01:39:09,671
We do!

862
01:39:26,520 --> 01:39:28,390
Maybe I asked too much
from you too soon.

863
01:39:32,170 --> 01:39:35,405
I'll expect less of you from now on.
Okay?

864
01:39:44,810 --> 01:39:45,960
I'm sorry.

865
01:39:48,591 --> 01:39:49,602
Shhh.

866
01:39:55,940 --> 01:39:57,320
You're my favorite.

867
01:40:00,450 --> 01:40:01,940
I won't lose you.

868
01:40:30,420 --> 01:40:32,919
Are you alright?

869
01:40:32,920 --> 01:40:35,581
- What the hell happened?
- She kicked me down the fucking stairs.

870
01:40:35,582 --> 01:40:36,582
what's it gonna fucking take, Lucy.

871
01:40:39,640 --> 01:40:40,996
You could have killed him.

872
01:40:40,997 --> 01:40:41,997
- I was confused.

873
01:40:42,140 --> 01:40:44,639
About what,
what are you so confused about?

874
01:40:44,640 --> 01:40:45,782
- I thought he was someone else.

875
01:40:45,783 --> 01:40:46,783
You thought he was someone else?

876
01:40:46,784 --> 01:40:47,784
What the fuck is wrong with you?

877
01:40:49,699 --> 01:40:50,903
What is wrong with you?

878
01:40:51,540 --> 01:40:53,220
I'm not doing this anymore,

879
01:40:53,790 --> 01:40:58,490
Okay, I'm not gonna do this
anymore. I beat myself up over
you for years and I'm sick of it,

880
01:40:59,190 --> 01:41:03,044
I'm sick of chasing you
down and worrying about you.

881
01:41:03,045 --> 01:41:04,045
I'm sorry.

882
01:41:03,300 --> 01:41:06,740
You need help Martha.

883
01:41:06,741 --> 01:41:07,741
I know.

884
01:41:08,430 --> 01:41:09,550
What happened to you?

885
01:41:11,770 --> 01:41:14,240
- What happened?
- I don't know!

886
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:28,610
We're going to get you proper help.

887
01:41:33,260 --> 01:41:34,650
Are you going to send me away?

888
01:41:35,500 --> 01:41:36,550
I don't know how to help you.

889
01:41:38,510 --> 01:41:40,600
Please don't. Please don't.
- I can't help you, Martha.

890
01:41:44,130 --> 01:41:45,000
No.

891
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:53,680
We're trying to start a family and
I don't feel safe with you here.

892
01:41:55,470 --> 01:41:56,510
Lucy?

893
01:41:57,400 --> 01:41:58,300
Yeah.

894
01:42:02,690 --> 01:42:04,280
You're going to be a terrible mother.

895
01:42:24,930 --> 01:42:26,220
Do you have any money left?

896
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:30,010
No.

897
01:42:31,730 --> 01:42:33,378
- No, i didn't think you did.

898
01:42:37,950 --> 01:42:40,859
We'll make sure everything
is taken care of.

899
01:43:05,750 --> 01:43:06,630
Hey.

900
01:43:12,090 --> 01:43:14,140
You're going swimming?

901
01:43:14,141 --> 01:43:15,141
- Yeah.

902
01:43:16,160 --> 01:43:17,150
It's a bit chilly.

903
01:43:19,132 --> 01:43:20,251
- I don't mind.

904
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:31,392
I think we both said some things
last night that we didn't mean.

905
01:43:31,393 --> 01:43:32,393
Yeah.

906
01:43:46,680 --> 01:43:48,750
We scheduled an appointment
for you tomorrow morning.

907
01:43:49,960 --> 01:43:51,010
What's it like there?

908
01:43:54,230 --> 01:43:55,380
It looks nice.

01:43:57,370 --> 01:43:58,270
It's not that far from us.

910
01:44:08,600 --> 01:44:10,000
We're heading back to the
city in about an hour.

911
01:44:10,001 --> 01:44:13,219
You're gonna be ready right?

01:44:37,300 --> 01:44:38,780
Are you okay?

914
01:44:38,781 --> 01:44:39,781
Yeah, I'm fine.

915
01:44:39,540 --> 01:44:41,020
It came out of nowhere.

916
01:45:13,316 --> 01:45:15,686
