1
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:56,766
And her tits are, like, firm
as fuck, dude, like, firm as fuck.

2
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:57,632
Nice.

3
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:59,137
Yeah, they're totally nice.

4
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:00,832
And like...
and it's just getting hot,

5
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,374
I got my dick out,
it's like hard as fuck,

6
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:04,410
and, like, she's, like,
we're both, like, hot,

7
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:05,444
and, like, I' m ready for her,

8
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:07,775
she's fucking wet
and ready for me, right,

9
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:11,840
and then I got her shirt off,
I got my shirt off and shit,

10
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,409
and then she goes to take
her panties off, man.

11
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:15,920
She goes to take
her panties off,

12
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:20,153
and I looked down at that shit,
and I went, "Oh, shit."

13
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:21,557
I was, like, cover that shit back up.

14
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:23,789
This shit is so fuckin' nasty, man,

15
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:26,525
like she's got, like,
some nasty white shit

16
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:27,964
like drippin' out of her cunt, man.

17
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:28,762
That's fuckin' sick, man.

18
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:29,699
I know. I made her cover that shit up,

19
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,634
and she's like sitting there, like,
what the fuck is the problem?

20
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:34,571
Like she didn't even know
there's like this nasty yogurt shit

21
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:36,541
drippin' from her cunt.

22
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:40,136
I'm like, I' m like... the fucked up
part is, like, she's 14,

23
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:41,180
so I' m, like, thinking
where the fuck

24
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:43,340
has this girl' s snatch been
at 14, man?

25
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,849
Like, she's so fuckin'...
you know what I mean?

26
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:46,248
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
She's 14?

27
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,877
Yeah, man, 14.

28
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,251
Fuckin' 14?

29
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:50,289
Yeah.

30
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:53,416
Fuck that.
That's fuckin' bullshit.

31
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:54,790
Dude, she's 14.

32
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:58,160
Dude, I believe some shit
out of you... some shit.

33
00:04:58,231 --> 00:04:59,892
OK? I' II buy some of your shit.

34
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,093
Like that story about the girl
with a fuckin' bag over her head

35
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:03,931
sucking your dick
'cause she was ugly?

36
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:06,267
I'll buy that shit, man,
but this sounds like bullshit.

37
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:07,636
It's not bullshit, man.

38
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:08,799
OK, what was her name?

39
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,103
It's Kate.

40
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:12,770
Kate, the fuckin' young, smelly bitch.

41
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:13,777
I don't buy it, man.

42
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:16,440
Dude, her name's fuckin' Kate.

43
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,913
So what are you doing
tomorrow night, dude?

44
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,454
I don't know.
Didn't really make any plans.

45
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:24,922
You goin' to that party
at Brian's house?

46
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,687
I don't know, man.
His last party was weak as shit.

47
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,227
Yeah, but first of all...

48
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:30,091
Waste of time.

49
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,858
There's gonna be free beer.

50
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:33,159
And second, it's
the Fourth of July, man.

51
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:35,291
Hey, do you think Christie's
gonna be there?

52
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:37,029
I... why?

53
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:38,229
I don't know, man.
Just asking.

54
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:39,134
You want to fuck her.

55
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:41,230
No fuckin' reason.
No, man, I was just asking.

56
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:42,171
She's not my girlfriend anymore.

57
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:43,902
If you want to fuck her,
go ahead, fuck her.

58
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:45,034
If she wants to, I mean.

59
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:46,100
Really?

60
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,441
Yeah, I don't care.

61
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:55,113
What are you looking at?

62
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:55,847
Huh?

63
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:58,390
What are you looking at?

64
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,016
Nothing.

65
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:10,862
I think they were lesbians.

66
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:12,461
Who?

67
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:13,903
Those two girls.

68
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:15,133
I don't think so.

69
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:15,936
Yeah.

70
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:16,667
No.

71
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:18,506
Sure.

72
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:21,206
How come no guys
ever check us out?

73
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,679
They do sometimes.

74
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:25,775
No, no one's asked me
for a phone number or anything

75
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:27,513
in such a long time.

76
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:28,849
They're just scared is all.

77
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:30,980
You think?

78
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,188
Gus was nice to me.

79
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:36,626
Yeah.

80
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:39,187
Because he wanted to sleep
with me, he was nice to me.

81
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:43,827
Like he'd say nice stuff
and then he'd make a move.

82
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,564
You know, he'd say
nice shit to me

83
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:49,734
and then I' d let him
touch me a little bit.

84
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:51,242
He'd say more nice shit,

85
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:56,009
and he'd try to work up
to a lot more than that,

86
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,050
and then I stopped him.

87
00:06:58,117 --> 00:07:00,585
And he's all, like,
"I know you want it."

88
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:03,019
Right? I mean,
who even says that?

89
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:08,994
And he keeps trying to touch me
and I keep pushing him away and...

90
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:10,653
and then he gets mad.

91
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,425
He's not a nice guy.

92
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:15,695
Yeah...

93
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:18,293
but I wanted him to touch me,
I wanted to sleep with him,

94
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:21,101
I was just, like, you know,
building up to it,

95
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:24,473
like back and forth, you know?

96
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:28,503
So he gets mad for a second,
but then he's not mad anymore,

97
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:33,985
and then, uh, he's just, like,
silent for a whole minute,

98
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:37,113
and I' m sitting there thinking,
like, what the fuck is happening?

99
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:42,253
And then he turns to me
and he says, "I' m sorry."

100
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:45,525
And I still don't say anything.

101
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:47,118
So you see any fireworks
tonight, man?

102
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,525
Nope. Did you?

103
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:50,857
No.

104
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:56,232
Well, like, just that shit
that people were setting off.

105
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:58,668
It's fuckin' stupid, like,
all the shit that's cool

106
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:00,899
it's all illegal.

107
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:02,270
You know, all the shit
that goes up in the sky,

108
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:04,104
it's all illegal.

109
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:06,974
Anything that's cool is illegal.

110
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,274
Yeah, yeah.

111
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:09,746
I'd say.

112
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:12,443
Hey, do you have your eye
on any girls here tonight?

113
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:14,577
I don't know.

114
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:17,020
Did you see that Asian chick?

115
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:18,681
Yeah. Yeah, I saw her.

116
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:19,486
She's hot.

117
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,186
I fuckin' saw the Asian chick, dude.

118
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,558
Do you think Christie's
gonna be here tonight?

119
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:25,187
I don't know, man.

120
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:28,062
Lhope so.

121
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:28,998
You got a lighter or...

122
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:32,765
No, I think I fuckin' lost it.
Great.

123
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:37,966
I'll just go ask somebody.

124
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:41,571
Hey, um, do you have a lighter?

125
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:43,547
Uh, yeah.

126
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:45,614
Here you go.

127
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:47,710
Thanks.

128
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:49,254
You want a cigarette?

129
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:51,051
Sure.

130
00:09:57,863 --> 00:09:59,831
So you know Brian?

131
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:02,265
Um, my friend knows him,

132
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:05,236
and she was telling me that he
has these, like, wild parties

133
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:08,671
and all this crazy shit
always goes down, but, uh...

134
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:10,800
yeah, so far...

135
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:12,400
What? What do you mean?

136
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:15,072
I don't know, it just seems
pretty lame to me.

137
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:16,478
Yeah, yeah.

138
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:18,983
I mean, I don't know, it's OK.

139
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:20,951
Yeah.

140
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:24,183
Well, um...

141
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:27,657
shit, maybe I could do something
to help you out.

142
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:29,558
Oh, yeah?

143
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,688
Yeah, like, uh...

144
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:07,988
I think I met you before.

145
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:11,468
You're Gus' friend, right?

146
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:14,301
Yeah, I' m Gus' friend.

147
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:15,738
I'm Gus' friend.

148
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:19,471
But did you ever hear about me?
Like, Bill?

149
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:22,139
You know, did you ever hear
about me from somebody?

150
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:24,842
Like did ever somebody say
you know this kid Bill?

151
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:27,442
Yeah, Gus has talked about you.

152
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,248
Gus?

153
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,151
Mm-hmm.

154
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:38,793
Hey.

155
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,196
Hey, what's up?

156
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:43,064
Aren't you burning yourself?

157
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:44,830
Naw, I' m fine.

158
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:47,896
This is a safe zone right here.

159
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:49,497
Whoa.

160
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:54,869
Check it out.

161
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:57,643
Are you sure that you're
supposed to do those inside?

162
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,618
Not technically, but, uh...

163
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:04,488
me and you.

164
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,615
Do you live here?

165
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:08,285
No, this is actually...

166
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,850
Brian was in there a second ago.

167
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:11,362
This is Brian's house.

168
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,022
Um, we go, like...

169
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:16,262
He was in my band,
um, high school.

170
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:17,700
You know what I think
about you...

171
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:18,702
What about your tattoo?

172
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:20,671
My tattoo?

173
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,207
Well, I got to tell you,

174
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:24,299
I was in military school
for three months

175
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:26,844
when I was in seventh grade.

176
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:30,040
Uh, it was cool you know.

177
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:32,482
Besides all the bad shit that
happened, it was all right.

178
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:33,882
And I got this tattoo

179
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:37,582
when I was out of that
military school for six years,

180
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:38,953
and it was last week,

181
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:40,889
and I fuckin' got this tattoo.

182
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:43,286
You having a good time?

183
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:44,090
It's OK.

184
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:46,961
It's OK? You should be
having a good time.

185
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:49,523
I just don't know
that many people...

186
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,435
That's why you
got to keep drinking.

187
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:57,335
Makes the time a lot better.

188
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:03,980
Do you dye your hair
or is it naturally blond?

189
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:05,277
No, I' m blond.

190
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:06,318
Really?

191
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:07,044
Yeah.

192
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,643
Come on, be honest.

193
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:10,814
I am being honest.

194
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,926
You OK?

195
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:15,585
It's fine.

196
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:20,223
You seem like you're really,
like, like, weird.

197
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:24,258
I don't know, you're looking
down at your beer and...

198
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:28,506
I'm not sure what you're doing.

199
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:34,643
I'm staying in...

200
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:37,079
staying in my parents' game room,

201
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:40,141
and, like, me, I could
sleep anywhere, you know,

202
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:43,245
and if it's on the floor
or on the pool table,

203
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:47,224
if it's what happens,
that's cool you know?

204
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:48,282
What?

205
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:48,883
Nothing.

206
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:49,928
It seems like you're laughing.

207
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,122
No, I' m not.

208
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:56,066
Well, I was thinking about
going on a cigarette run,

209
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:57,898
because I' m all out,

210
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,234
and I was thinking...

211
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:01,500
I was thinking, uh...

212
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:03,098
if you want to come.

213
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,643
Lhave some good CDs...

214
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:06,473
we could listen to.

215
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:08,536
I should stay here, actually,
'cause of Christie.

216
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:09,478
I don't want to just leave her.

217
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:10,344
It's like if I...

218
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,247
I know, but I' m her ride home.

219
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:14,582
Well, um, they have
really cheap cigarettes...

220
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:16,211
I think I' m gonna stay
'cause I' m her ride home.

221
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:19,655
I just... I just don't
want to leave her.

222
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:21,420
All right, well, I found...

223
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:24,587
I found this, like, weird
fuckin' awesome pot

224
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:27,359
in my brother's room.

225
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:29,298
It was, uh...

226
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:32,599
It was in his drawer, and, uh...

227
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:36,539
just a little sort of synopsis,
it's awesome,

228
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:39,840
and it'll make this party go
from boring

229
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:44,645
to fuckin' not boring
in, like, ten.

230
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,083
So...

231
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:49,882
I'm OK, but thank you.

232
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:54,024
You don't smoke?

233
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:57,221
I mean, I do sometimes,
but I' m Christie's ride home.

234
00:14:57,296 --> 00:15:00,390
That's very responsible of you.

235
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:02,263
I respect that.

236
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:03,130
What's up, man?

237
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:04,169
What's up?

238
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,636
You're the kind of friend
that I wish I had.

239
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:09,606
Because my friends always
leave me places, and it sucks.

240
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:11,336
What was your name?

241
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,502
My name is Jessica.

242
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:13,977
All right, Jessica.

243
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:16,344
I don't want you to think
that I' m, like, hitting on you

244
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,144
or anything...

245
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:21,477
Are you...

246
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:24,750
Are you Missy Sanders'
older brother?

247
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:25,448
Am I

248
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:26,218
Yeah.

249
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:30,661
Um... no... well, yeah.

250
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:33,220
Yeah.

251
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:34,960
Um...

252
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:39,334
'Cause I was friends with her
in the fourth grade.

253
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:41,771
All right.

254
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,638
It's... I should really go find
my friend Christie,

255
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:45,699
'cause I haven't...

256
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,712
I mean, I didn't spend a lot
of the party with her, so...

257
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,042
What does that mean?

258
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:52,345
It means that I should go
find my friend Christie.

259
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:13,563
Hey.

260
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,298
Hey, Gus.

261
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:16,273
Have you guys seen Bill around?

262
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:18,242
No.

263
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,743
Well...

264
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,575
What?

265
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,047
I think he's with Christie.

266
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:26,817
I broke up with her...

267
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:28,978
and she broke up with me.

268
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:30,521
Hey!

269
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:31,180
How's it goin'?

270
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:32,018
Hey, what's up?

271
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:35,925
What's up? What's up?
You're back, huh?

272
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,156
Yeah, yeah.

273
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:38,855
Yeah.

274
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:40,523
I didn't expect to see you here.

275
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:43,397
Well, you know, I' m here.

276
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:45,334
There's a party goin' on.

277
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:46,666
Where you been?

278
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:49,572
Um... I...

279
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:51,632
I been all over, you know...

280
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,644
I was drivin' all over the place.

281
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:55,441
Cool.

282
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,641
You ever been to Nebraska?

283
00:16:57,716 --> 00:17:00,685
No, no.

284
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:03,654
Well, you know how, like,
if you think of Nebraska

285
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:06,088
you can't really think
of anything that's there?

286
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:07,489
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

287
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:08,617
Yeah.

288
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,993
Well, there's actually
a lot of stuff there.

289
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:13,895
That's pretty cool.

290
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:16,298
So what are you doing here?

291
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,835
I don't know, I just...

292
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:20,929
I guess...

293
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:25,705
I really didn't know what
I was doing, and, uh...

294
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:27,973
I ran out of money, and...

295
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:28,945
I'm back, you know.

296
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:30,982
I'm just...

297
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,577
I uh...

298
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:37,486
lhad this job in Texas, but...

299
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,319
fuck.

300
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,689
I didn't want to stay there.

301
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:07,685
In Nebraska, all right,
in Nebraska,

302
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:11,712
there's this...
there's this road...

303
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:16,159
and it's, like, this
really long road, and it's...

304
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:18,458
after a while it turns into gravel

305
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:21,863
and I was driving
down this road, right?

306
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,835
This was... March.

307
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:27,770
And I' m driving
down this road, and...

308
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,641
and when the road ends,
it's like this state park, this...

309
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:33,735
It's like this big park,

310
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:36,178
and it seems like it's open
to the public, right?

311
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:39,877
But, like, I went into it, and it's...

312
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,385
There was...

313
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,512
Empty. It was empty,
as far as I could tell.

314
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:45,955
And...

315
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:47,457
I was walking around this park,

316
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:51,656
and I got up to, like,
the top of this hill, you know,

317
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:55,097
and it was like this one spot,
in this one direction,

318
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:56,429
I was looking out,

319
00:18:56,502 --> 00:19:00,063
and for as...

320
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,671
like as far as I could see,

321
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:05,301
as far as I could see,
there was, like, nothing.

322
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:09,939
It was like I could see
some trees and...

323
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:11,573
I guess it was around sunset.

324
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,881
It was just... it was...

325
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:16,818
fuckin'...

326
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:20,082
I don't know.

327
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:24,425
There was like, I really felt like...

328
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:27,056
I really felt like...

329
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:31,432
I knew what it must have
been like to be...

330
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:34,301
really lost.

331
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:39,008
It was like...

332
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:40,374
I don't know.

333
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:42,845
It was...

334
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:36,361
- Hey.
- Hey.

335
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:37,868
How's it goin'?

336
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:39,904
It's OK.

337
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:46,206
Hey, you're Christie's friend,
right? Jessica?

338
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:47,939
Yeah.

339
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:49,105
I'm Gus.

340
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:52,446
We've actually met before.

341
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:53,484
Yeah.

342
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:56,316
I mean, not like officially,
just...

343
00:20:56,388 --> 00:21:01,758
I've been places with Christie,
you know, where you've been.

344
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:05,695
Do you want to sit down?

345
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:08,562
I've heard a lot about you.

346
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:09,828
Really?

347
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:13,302
Yeah, Christie told me some things.

348
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:15,272
Oh...

349
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,534
Yeah.

350
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:19,805
She... she told me some things.

351
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:26,779
So what are you doing out here?

352
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:28,547
I was just watching fireworks.

353
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,145
Some people were
setting them off.

354
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,198
It's nice out here.

355
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:44,758
Yeah.

356
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:47,327
You remember the Fourth of July
as a kid?

357
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:50,000
I guess so.

358
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:51,633
I always thought it sucked.

359
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:52,768
Really?

360
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:53,606
Yeah.

361
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:54,976
I kind of like it now, though.

362
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:57,345
Ilike it.

363
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,453
You all right?

364
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:09,688
What do you mean?

365
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:12,025
I mean, you look...

366
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:13,621
like. Not so good or...

367
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:15,428
Really?

368
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,901
Well, I mean...

369
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,700
I mean...

370
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:23,741
I'm... I' m OK.

371
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:26,209
Well, you just kind of look
upset, that's all.

372
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:29,145
I'm all right.
You know.

373
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:32,945
Things are fine.

374
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,919
So what are you doing out here
all by yourself?

375
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:37,386
You're here.

376
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:39,151
Well, before, though.

377
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:42,159
I was watching the fireworks.

378
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:49,131
Why are you being
so nice to me?

379
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:52,934
What... what do you mean?

380
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:56,167
You're being nice to me.

381
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:58,675
I'm just being regular.

382
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:00,974
I'm not gonna sleep with you.

383
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,638
I wasn't thinking...

384
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:05,046
Well, if you were
or you weren't,

385
00:23:05,117 --> 00:23:08,052
I'm just not, OK?

386
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,281
OK.

387
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:16,820
I know what people say about me.
I know what Christie said about me.

388
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,487
Really?

389
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:21,623
Yeah.

390
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:27,070
I start that shit, you know,
the shit about things I do.

391
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:28,299
I tell people...

392
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:31,706
I tell people a girl sucked my dick
through a hole in a paper bag.

393
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:33,506
Lhadn't heard that one.

394
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:35,637
Yeah.

395
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:43,813
No, I hadn't heard that.

396
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:46,357
Well, I guess you get a bigger
reputation than is really true.

397
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:47,722
I mean, some of it's true.

398
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:48,760
All right.

399
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:50,624
I mean, I do like...

400
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:52,492
I...

401
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:57,661
I really don't give a fuck
about your reputation.

402
00:23:57,736 --> 00:23:59,067
Right.

403
00:23:59,137 --> 00:24:02,334
I just think you're an asshole.

404
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:07,973
OK.

405
00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:10,071
But...

406
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:12,116
Tell you what, let me start,
let me start over,

407
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:14,846
like, from scratch, OK?

408
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,818
All right.

409
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:17,912
Yeah, pretend like you
haven't been talking to me

410
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:21,516
for the last couple
of minutes, OK?

411
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:26,030
I want to set some stuff
straight, OK?

412
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:29,294
Hey...

413
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:30,356
Do...

414
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:34,132
Do you want to know what
Christie told me about you?

415
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:36,106
Yeah, sure.

416
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:43,579
Well, she said that, like,
at first you were, you know,

417
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,707
doing anything you could to, like,

418
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:48,252
try and get your dick in her,
but then, like...

419
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,309
Listen...

420
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:52,481
No, just wait,
just let me finish.

421
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:55,082
So that was just like at first.

422
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:59,062
But then after she stopped you,
you, like, said that, you know,

423
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:01,155
you wouldn't even touch her
if she didn't want you to

424
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:05,897
and you asked her if she
would be like your girlfriend,

425
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:07,131
like your real girlfriend,

426
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:10,834
and she just kind of
got up and left.

427
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:17,013
So did you mean it?

428
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:18,071
What?

429
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:20,049
Like not touching her?

430
00:25:20,118 --> 00:25:23,053
I mean, did you mean it,
or were you just saying it?

431
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:26,147
I mean, yeah,
I guess I meant it.

432
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,332
Can I tell you something?

433
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:41,236
Sure.

434
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:42,136
Before I tell you, though,

435
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:45,040
you got to promise you're
never gonna tell anyone.

436
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,772
OK.

437
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:51,976
I mean, it's a serious promise, though.

438
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:55,542
It's something really bad.

439
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:59,147
Like I' ve never told anyone
before, like...

440
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,953
and I don't really know you, so...

441
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:05,395
but if you make a serious promise,
then I' II believe you.

442
00:26:05,463 --> 00:26:08,489
I seriously promise.

443
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,057
OK.

444
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:16,730
OK, so...

445
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:19,402
I was at this party last year,

446
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:21,877
like right before school
started back again, right,

447
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:25,644
and there's this girl there,
like 14, right?

448
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:28,208
And every guy there
was looking at her,

449
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:29,583
like, every guy wanted
to get with her.

450
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:30,951
I wanted to get with her.

451
00:26:31,022 --> 00:26:34,082
So, like, I see her drinking
more and more and more.

452
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,457
But then she, like,
she's gone for a while,

453
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:37,358
and I like, forget about her,

454
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,795
because there was, like, a bunch
of other hot girls there.

455
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:41,855
But the whole night it just
wasn't happening,

456
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:45,096
so, like, finally
I get really, really drunk,

457
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:46,194
like shitty drunk,

458
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:49,900
and I like, take these Vicodins,
and so I' m like totally fucked,

459
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:53,809
and I decide I' m gonna go
and head up to my buddy's room

460
00:26:53,878 --> 00:26:55,505
to, like, jerk off, you know.

461
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,844
But I go into his bedroom,

462
00:26:57,916 --> 00:27:01,818
and on the floor is this
14-year-old girl passed out,

463
00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:04,821
and there's this guy in there
and he's about to get on her.

464
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:07,824
And, like, he's got her clothes off,
and he got his clothes off,

465
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:10,952
and he's... he's like
about to do it, you know,

466
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:12,223
so I like, I walk in

467
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:14,993
and I know what's goin' on
in, like, half a second.

468
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:18,331
And I' m, like, man, what the fuck
are you doing, you know?

469
00:27:18,403 --> 00:27:20,564
And...

470
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,903
and he, like, gets up
and he, like, looks at me

471
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:25,738
and, like, buckles his shit
back up or whatever,

472
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:29,246
and then I' m like, man,
get the fuck out of here.

473
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,646
And so he leaves, and then, like,
so there I am standing there

474
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:34,685
with this girl passed out
on the floor,

475
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:36,721
so I like, go over to her
and I get her clothes

476
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:39,757
and, like, I put 'em back on her
and, I like, put her shoes on her,

477
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:42,088
and, like, I tie 'em back up,

478
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:46,187
and I just start to get this, like,
feeling, you know, like...

479
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:48,255
So I go over to the door
and I lock it.

480
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,324
And then I shake her
a little bit

481
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:52,165
to make sure she's not
gonna wake up or anything,

482
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:56,936
and then I take
like half a second, and then...

483
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:59,374
I don't know, I just, like...

484
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:02,106
took her clothes off
and I just got on her,

485
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:05,877
and I just, like, started,
you know.

486
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:08,145
And...

487
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:12,178
and I was, like, on her
for a minute, and then...

488
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:13,121
and then I stopped,

489
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:16,592
like all of the sudden
I just stopped, and...

490
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:18,959
I realize what the fuck I' m doing,

491
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:22,659
and so I go to get off of her,
and I opened my eyes,

492
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:25,032
and I look down
and I realize she's awake

493
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:29,369
and she's, like, staring
right back at me.

494
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:30,840
And...

495
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:31,876
I like, freak out,

496
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:33,740
like I back myself up
against the wall

497
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:35,803
and I' m, like, staring at her,
and she's, like, just...

498
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,371
she's just, like, lifeless,
like lying on the floor,

499
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:39,917
like not even moving at all,

500
00:28:39,984 --> 00:28:41,713
and, like, I buckled
my shit back up

501
00:28:41,786 --> 00:28:43,686
and I' m about to walk out,
and she goes,

502
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:46,690
and she goes, "Hey," and then
she's, like, sitting up now,

503
00:28:46,758 --> 00:28:48,658
and she's completely still
out of it and everything,

504
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:51,025
but she's, like, sitting up
and, like, looking,

505
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:52,393
staring right at me.

506
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:53,396
And I just stare back at her,

507
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:55,831
and she says, "Hey, what
did you do to me?"

508
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,733
And she, like, started crying.

509
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:03,399
She just, like, started
crying and crying.

510
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:07,411
And I like, put
my arm around her and...

511
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:11,410
And then she started to...

512
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:12,780
she started to say, "I' m sorry,"

513
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:15,979
like over and over
and over again, like...

514
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:17,043
Like she wasn't really...
I don't know what...

515
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:21,354
She wasn't saying it to me,
like, she was just...

516
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:27,160
saying "I' m sorry," like she was
ashamed or something, you know.

517
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:29,530
And...

518
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:32,536
and I just blurted out,
"You can trust me.

519
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,629
Tell me to do anything,
I can do it," you know.

520
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:36,071
And she...

521
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:39,736
and she said,
"I don't want anything."

522
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:42,143
And so I just sat there with her
for a couple minutes,

523
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:47,674
and finally she just says,
"My name is Kate."

524
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:50,243
And then she just fell asleep.

525
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:54,319
And so I just sat there
for a couple minutes,

526
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:58,089
and then I walked out,
and that was it.

527
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:07,962
And after that I was, like...

528
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:11,440
I was, like, I was sure
I was gonna change.

529
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:14,967
I didn't want to...

530
00:30:15,046 --> 00:30:18,812
like, just get laid
all the time, and, like...

531
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:20,680
fuck with people 's shit,
you know, like...

532
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:21,741
Gus...

533
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,253
I can do...

534
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:24,879
I can do good, like,
I can do bad...

535
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:29,518
I do bad things a lot of times,
but I' m not a bad person.

536
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:31,653
Gus...

537
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:33,321
You know how like shit happens

538
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:36,526
and, like, time goes by
and, like, you just...

539
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:40,401
like, school started up again
and that...

540
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:43,634
and it was like I just forgot
about it, like, like...

541
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:44,970
it didn't seem so close to me,

542
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:48,035
like, it's like I didn't even
do it or something, like...

543
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:50,945
Like I was telling
my buddy Bill the story,

544
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:52,073
like, the same story,

545
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:54,050
but, like, completely different
from what I told you,

546
00:30:54,118 --> 00:30:57,110
like, I made up this whole story
about how this girl Kate,

547
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:58,086
she wanted to, like...

548
00:30:58,156 --> 00:31:00,954
like she wanted to fuck me, and, like...

549
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:03,585
like she had this...

550
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:04,787
I made up this whole story

551
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:07,229
of, like, a completely
different situation,

552
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:10,324
but I met her, like,
I was talking about her,

553
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:12,699
I was thinking about her.

554
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:18,974
But I know what I did, like...

555
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:21,102
You know?

556
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:42,218
Do you want to go somewhere?

557
00:32:47,565 --> 00:32:49,692
Sure.

558
00:36:47,738 --> 00:36:51,367
Are you cold?

559
00:36:51,442 --> 00:36:53,740
No.

560
00:36:57,448 --> 00:36:59,473
Are you?

561
00:37:59,143 --> 00:38:00,440
<i>We've got a right!</i>

562
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:02,445
<i>You going down there with him?</i>

563
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:04,606
<i>Yes or no.</i>
<i>This is your last chance.</i>

564
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:06,980
<i>No beatin'around the bush.</i>

565
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:09,110
<i>Listen, I got a kid down there.</i>

566
00:38:09,186 --> 00:38:10,983
<i>She can't possibly...</i>
<i>I couldn't bring her up here.</i>

567
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:12,522
<i>She can't possibly take</i>
<i>all the racket</i>

568
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,854
<i>of those things smashing</i>
<i>through the windows.</i>

569
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:16,722
<i>Well, you're her father.</i>

570
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:18,523
<i>If you're stupid enough</i>
<i>to go die in that trap,</i>

571
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:19,426
<i>that's your business.</i>

572
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:22,830
<i>I am not stupid enough</i>
<i>to follow you.</i>

573
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:26,028
<i>It is tough for the kid</i>
<i>that her old man is so stupid.</i>

574
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:28,594
<i>Now get the hell down</i>
<i>in the cellar.</i>

575
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:33,235
<i>You can be the boss down there.</i>
<i>I'm boss up here.</i>

576
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:37,304
<i>You bastards!</i>

577
00:38:37,381 --> 00:38:39,008
<i>You know I won't open</i>
<i>this door again.</i>

578
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:40,277
<i>I mean it.</i>

579
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:41,716
<i>Mr. Cooper, with your help,</i>
<i>we could...</i>

580
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:43,185
<i>With my help.</i>

581
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:45,154
<i>Let him go, man.</i>
<i>His mind is made up.</i>

582
00:38:45,222 --> 00:38:48,749
<i>Just let him go.</i>

583
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:51,761
<i>Wait a minute!</i>

584
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:53,990
<i>Judy, come on up here, honey.</i>

585
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:22,386
Hey.

586
00:39:25,663 --> 00:39:27,654
Wake up.

587
00:39:27,732 --> 00:39:28,721
What?

588
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:30,323
It's almost 10.

589
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:30,924
Oh.

590
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:33,401
Get up.

591
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,998
Hey, Bill.

592
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,795
Nothin' much.

593
00:40:07,371 --> 00:40:10,169
Yeah.

594
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:13,176
Aw, fine.

595
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,235
Ah, we didn't do it.

596
00:40:18,382 --> 00:40:20,316
Yeah, yeah.

597
00:40:20,384 --> 00:40:22,852
Hey...

598
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,909
Yeah.

599
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:27,185
Hey, man, I need
a phone number from you.

600
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:31,695
I need a phone number.

601
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:33,730
Can I get the number?

602
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:37,132
Right.

603
00:40:48,245 --> 00:40:50,008
Yeah, what?

604
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:55,010
Yeah. Yeah. Cool.

605
00:40:55,085 --> 00:40:57,178
Well, hey, how about
I get that number?

606
00:40:57,254 --> 00:40:58,744
Wally Briggs.
You know that guy?

607
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:01,223
Hey, Wally, man, it's Gus.

608
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:04,090
Hey, man, you know that girl Kate?

609
00:41:04,161 --> 00:41:05,526
Uh, yeah, Kate.

610
00:41:05,596 --> 00:41:10,329
She's like 14 or 15,
she's got brown hair.

611
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:12,995
You know her last name?

612
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,733
You're not sure?

613
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:21,244
Uh, I was wantin' to...
I was wantin' to call her up,

614
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,712
see her or something, you know?

615
00:41:40,397 --> 00:41:41,796
Hey, Dad.

616
00:41:43,868 --> 00:41:45,802
Yeah.

617
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:53,402
I'm all right.

618
00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:55,945
What are you doing right now?

619
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:03,082
Have you had breakfast yet?

620
00:42:05,623 --> 00:42:07,090
Oh.

621
00:42:07,157 --> 00:42:09,250
Well, what about lunch?

622
00:43:20,998 --> 00:43:22,295
Hey.

623
00:43:22,366 --> 00:43:23,731
Hi.

624
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:26,602
Hi.

625
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:30,197
Uh... I guess you don't know me.

626
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:30,968
Um...

627
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:33,475
Have we met before?

628
00:43:33,544 --> 00:43:35,478
Kind of.

629
00:43:35,546 --> 00:43:36,535
I mean, uh...

630
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,275
we met at a party.

631
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:39,213
Oh.

632
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:41,342
Like a year ago, so...

633
00:43:41,418 --> 00:43:45,149
Oh, OK.

634
00:43:46,857 --> 00:43:48,882
What's up?

635
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:51,154
Uh, nothing, I was just, um...

636
00:43:51,228 --> 00:43:52,695
I was in the area,

637
00:43:52,763 --> 00:43:56,529
so I thought I' d stop by
and see if you were home.

638
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,966
All right.

639
00:43:59,036 --> 00:44:00,469
Well...

640
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:05,604
OK.

641
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:13,075
Do you want to come in
or something and watch TV?

642
00:44:19,523 --> 00:44:21,787
Sure, yeah.

643
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,717
Are you thirsty?

644
00:44:49,787 --> 00:44:52,255
Uh...

645
00:44:52,322 --> 00:44:53,016
For...

646
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:55,786
Do you want something to drink,
like a Coke?

647
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:57,087
No, no, thanks.

648
00:44:57,161 --> 00:45:01,393
I'm gonna have one.
I could get you one, too.

649
00:45:01,465 --> 00:45:03,831
OK, sure, if you're
gonna have one.

650
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:06,267
Thanks.

651
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:33,856
Thanks.

652
00:45:43,373 --> 00:45:45,034
So what's been up?

653
00:45:45,109 --> 00:45:47,703
Um...

654
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:49,837
not much, I guess.

655
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:54,406
Just hangin' out?

656
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:56,680
Pretty much.

657
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:04,224
Cool.

658
00:46:04,294 --> 00:46:07,752
What do you like to do?

659
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:12,897
I don't know, just hang out
with my friends.

660
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:15,336
Nothing, really.

661
00:46:32,222 --> 00:46:34,588
Ilike your ring.

662
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:39,051
Thanks.

663
00:46:42,432 --> 00:46:45,265
Ilike yours, too.

664
00:46:45,335 --> 00:46:47,098
Thanks.

665
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,068
Is it plastic?

666
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:54,838
Yes.

667
00:47:25,742 --> 00:47:28,870
So...

668
00:47:28,946 --> 00:47:31,915
did you ever have
a boyfriend, like, before?

669
00:47:31,982 --> 00:47:33,677
Yeah.

670
00:47:38,088 --> 00:47:41,785
How long, uh...
how long was that?

671
00:47:42,993 --> 00:47:45,553
- A long time.
- A long time?

672
00:47:45,629 --> 00:47:48,462
Yeah.

673
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:52,059
Like... over a year or...

674
00:47:52,135 --> 00:47:54,160
Yep.

675
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:58,069
What happened with that?

676
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:02,376
We don't really have to talk
about that.

677
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:08,677
Unless you really, really
want to know.

678
00:48:08,752 --> 00:48:12,779
Yeah. Something, I guess.

679
00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:36,443
So has anything, like, really bad
ever happened to you?

680
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:43,083
Like what?

681
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:49,392
I don't know. Like anything.

682
00:48:56,166 --> 00:48:59,431
Anything bad happen to you?

683
00:48:59,503 --> 00:49:01,801
No.

684
00:49:05,175 --> 00:49:08,372
I was just curious.

685
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:10,436
OK.

686
00:49:17,688 --> 00:49:20,521
No?

687
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:22,581
Uh... no.

688
00:49:27,898 --> 00:49:30,264
That's good.

689
00:49:30,334 --> 00:49:32,768
Yeah.

690
00:52:31,748 --> 00:52:33,648
Hey, Bill, what's up?

691
00:53:26,803 --> 00:53:28,703
Man, I saw some
fucked-up shit today.

692
00:53:28,772 --> 00:53:29,534
Yeah?

693
00:53:29,606 --> 00:53:32,507
Yep. On the train.

694
00:53:32,576 --> 00:53:35,067
This old lady bleeding
out of her nose,

695
00:53:35,145 --> 00:53:36,203
like bleeding everywhere.

696
00:53:36,279 --> 00:53:36,938
Shit.

697
00:53:37,013 --> 00:53:38,173
All over the place.

698
00:53:38,248 --> 00:53:40,409
No, seriously,
all over the place.

699
00:53:40,483 --> 00:53:42,280
Fuckin' everywhere,
and everyone was looking.

700
00:53:42,352 --> 00:53:43,148
That's fucked up.

701
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,118
Yeah.

702
00:53:44,187 --> 00:53:45,586
What did you do today?

703
00:53:45,655 --> 00:53:49,523
Nothing. I just messed around,
you know, whatever.

704
00:53:49,593 --> 00:53:52,153
Yeah.

705
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:54,288
I'm sorry about the phone, man.

706
00:53:54,364 --> 00:53:55,524
The phone?

707
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:57,191
Yeah, you know, I was kind of
being a dick, I guess.

708
00:53:57,267 --> 00:54:01,033
Aw, man, it's cool.
No sweat.

709
00:54:01,104 --> 00:54:01,798
Cool.

710
00:54:01,871 --> 00:54:03,168
No sweat at all.

711
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,730
You seeing Christie tonight?

712
00:54:04,808 --> 00:54:07,038
Yeah, I' m gonna see her
in a little bit.

713
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:08,202
She coming here?

714
00:54:08,278 --> 00:54:11,941
No, we're going to meet up
at Stevens Amusement Park.

715
00:54:12,015 --> 00:54:13,880
Really. Cool.

716
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:16,680
Hey, do you want to go?

717
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:18,220
Sure.

718
00:54:18,288 --> 00:54:20,882
Cool man. You gonna see, uh...

719
00:54:20,957 --> 00:54:22,822
Jessica soon?

720
00:54:22,892 --> 00:54:24,018
I don't know.

721
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:28,030
Yeah, she's kind of a bitch anyways.

722
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:29,326
Yeah.

723
00:54:29,399 --> 00:54:30,991
Yep.

724
00:54:33,236 --> 00:54:35,227
Why do you say that?

725
00:54:35,305 --> 00:54:38,001
Aw, I don't know, man,
you know, like...

726
00:54:38,074 --> 00:54:42,135
she just seems like a total bitch.

727
00:54:42,212 --> 00:54:45,443
Like what about her, though,
I mean...

728
00:54:45,515 --> 00:54:46,709
Aw, man, I don't know.

729
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:51,584
Nothing in particular. Whatever.

730
00:54:51,655 --> 00:54:55,284
Do you ever think maybe, uh...

731
00:54:55,358 --> 00:54:55,915
What?

732
00:54:55,992 --> 00:54:57,425
Nah...

733
00:54:57,494 --> 00:54:59,052
Never mind.

734
00:54:59,129 --> 00:54:59,618
What?

735
00:54:59,696 --> 00:55:01,823
I'm pretty drunk, man, like...

736
00:55:01,898 --> 00:55:02,887
You know what?

737
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:06,595
One time I got so drunk
and I was so fuckin' hungry...

738
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:08,069
And I' m not talking
about normally

739
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:09,833
when you get drunk
and you get hungry,

740
00:55:09,906 --> 00:55:11,567
like, you know,
normally food sounds,

741
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:12,767
like the sickest shit in the world.

742
00:55:12,842 --> 00:55:14,969
But I was so hungry...

743
00:55:15,045 --> 00:55:17,809
I'm kind of hungry
right now, dude.

744
00:55:17,881 --> 00:55:21,817
Yeah, me, too.

745
00:55:21,885 --> 00:55:23,682
You know what shit fucks me up?

746
00:55:23,753 --> 00:55:24,947
What?

747
00:55:25,021 --> 00:55:26,750
The clit.

748
00:55:28,058 --> 00:55:29,082
The clit?

749
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:33,528
You know, like, these girls
are always like,

750
00:55:33,596 --> 00:55:34,426
"Touch my clit," you know,

751
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:36,055
"rub my clit,
I want you to rub my clit,"

752
00:55:36,132 --> 00:55:39,192
you know, like,
I'm like, "Suck my dick."

753
00:55:39,269 --> 00:55:41,260
I just want you to suck my dick.
You know?

754
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:45,741
Totally, man.
That's bullshit.

755
00:55:45,809 --> 00:55:49,301
What the fuck.
Ilike saying "slut," though.

756
00:55:49,379 --> 00:55:52,246
Yeah. Yeah, I guess.

757
00:55:52,315 --> 00:55:53,304
You know, the word "slut."

758
00:55:53,383 --> 00:55:54,816
Yeah.

759
00:55:54,884 --> 00:55:56,283
Slut.

760
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:58,184
Bitch.

761
00:55:58,254 --> 00:56:01,746
Slit, clit, fuck, bitch.

762
00:56:01,825 --> 00:56:02,757
Cunt, cunt, cum, fuck...

764
00:56:05,562 --> 00:56:08,793
I don't know, it's kind of...

765
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:09,593
I don't know.

766
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:12,157
I get so fucked up, man, like...

767
00:56:12,235 --> 00:56:16,968
You know, you ever get totally,
like, like, like fucked?

00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,473
Right now.

769
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:21,874
No, not drunk.
Not drunk, though.

770
00:56:21,945 --> 00:56:22,707
Oh.

00:56:22,779 --> 00:56:25,441

Like you ever think about going
into photography, man?

776
00:56:37,293 --> 00:56:39,022
No!

00:56:44,701 --> 00:56:46,259
I mean, I know it's
like fag shit or whatever,

780
00:56:46,336 --> 00:56:47,803
but, like, you know...

781
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:49,133
That's all I' m trying to say.

782
00:56:49,205 --> 00:56:51,730
But I mean what the fuck,
why not, right?

783
00:56:51,808 --> 00:56:53,298
I don't know, man.
I guess.

784
00:56:53,376 --> 00:56:55,105

785
00:56:55,178 --> 00:56:56,270
I don't know.

786
00:56:56,346 --> 00:56:57,074
You don't know?

787
00:56:57,147 --> 00:56:58,739
No. Whatever.

788
00:56:58,815 --> 00:57:01,215
It's OK, though.

789
00:57:06,356 --> 00:57:09,814
I mean...

790
00:57:09,893 --> 00:57:12,191
Ilike Jessica, man.

I mean, they're fine, man,
but, like...

796
00:57:22,672 --> 00:57:27,268
Ilike... I like her, you know.
I really like her.

797
00:57:27,343 --> 00:57:28,537
Cool man.

00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:32,339
Yeah, whatever.
It's cool.

00:57:35,251 --> 00:57:37,719
But I don't want to fuck
with her shit.

801
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:40,017

802
00:57:40,089 --> 00:57:41,454

You know, like, I feel

807
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:51,767
Dude...

808
00:57:51,835 --> 00:57:53,029
If there's one thing I' ve learned,

809
00:57:53,102 --> 00:57:55,798
it's not to feel bad...

810
00:57:55,872 --> 00:57:57,567
about anything.

811
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:01,599
Don't do it to yourself, man.

812
00:58:01,678 --> 00:58:03,509
Thanks.

813
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:13,516
You want to give me a hug, man?

814
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:15,353

815
00:58:15,425 --> 00:58:18,758
Ahug.

Fuck you, man.

817
00:58:20,563 --> 00:58:22,463
I'm just saying, man,

818
00:58:22,532 --> 00:58:23,260
Ahug?

819
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:24,630
Just give me a fuckin' hug.

820
00:58:24,701 --> 00:58:28,102
No. I' m not giving you a hug.

821
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:28,728
No.

822
00:58:28,805 --> 00:58:30,295

00:58:30,373 --> 00:58:32,534
Fuck you, bitch.
Gimme a hug.

824
00:58:32,609 --> 00:58:35,373
Get over here.

825
00:58:35,445 --> 00:58:38,312
Thanks.

826
00:58:38,381 --> 00:58:39,780
You're a good friend, man.

827
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:41,840
Yeah, I know.

828
00:58:58,568 --> 00:59:00,468
You know what I think about
sometimes, man?

829
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:01,435
What?

830
00:59:01,504 --> 00:59:04,166
Like, OK, like,
before something happens,

831
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:06,140
there's a chance for anything,
you know?

832
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:09,144
Like... um...

833
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:10,645
Like what?

834
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:14,376
Like, OK, for instance, before
we go to this park here,

835
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:16,611
you could go on any
of the rides, right?

836
00:59:16,686 --> 00:59:19,678
Yeah. But I' m gonna go on
the Mummy's Revenge, dude.

837
00:59:19,756 --> 00:59:21,656
Right. OK, right.

838
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:23,624
But I mean, like...

839
00:59:23,693 --> 00:59:26,628
There's a chance for anything,
like anything could happen.

840
00:59:26,696 --> 00:59:29,631
Yeah, anything could happen,
but I' m going on the Mummy's Revenge.

841
00:59:29,699 --> 00:59:31,997
Right. I know you're going
on the Mummy's Revenge.

842
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:32,796
OK.

843
00:59:32,869 --> 00:59:33,836
But, like, you know,

844
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:35,200
what if you didn't go
on the Mummy's Revenge?

845
00:59:35,271 --> 00:59:36,636
What if something happened, like...

846
00:59:36,706 --> 00:59:39,266
The point is, like, anything
could happen, like...

847
00:59:39,342 --> 00:59:43,574
it's not... it's not set in stone
until you, like, actually do it.

848
00:59:43,646 --> 00:59:46,240
You know... because it hasn't
happened, you know?

849
00:59:46,316 --> 00:59:48,341
I guess. Yeah, man.

850
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:49,112
I don't know.

851
00:59:49,185 --> 00:59:50,379
What are you doing
on your birthday?

852
00:59:50,453 --> 00:59:52,387
'Cause I have
a really good idea.

853
00:59:52,455 --> 00:59:53,854
I don't know.

854
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:55,982
I was thinking we should go
to all the stuff you'll be able to do

855
00:59:56,059 --> 00:59:58,050
'cause you're 18 and all,
you know?

856
00:59:58,127 --> 00:59:59,287
Buy scratch -offs and shit?

857
00:59:59,362 --> 01:00:01,660
Yeah, like buy scratch -offs,
go to the porn store,

858
01:00:01,731 --> 01:00:03,494
buy cigarettes legally.

859
01:00:03,566 --> 01:00:05,500
Yeah.

860
01:00:21,651 --> 01:00:23,915
So where you meeting
Christie at?

861
01:00:23,987 --> 01:00:26,455
One of those corn dog stands
over there.

862
01:00:26,522 --> 01:00:29,116
Oh. You think she's here yet?

863
01:00:29,192 --> 01:00:31,057
I don't know.
Maybe not.

864
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:32,116
Yeah.

865
01:00:32,195 --> 01:00:34,561
You like Christie, man?

866
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:36,326
Yeah.

867
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:39,024
Well, I guess I' m gonna leave
you guys alone for a while.

868
01:00:39,102 --> 01:00:41,127
I'm gonna walk around by myself,
I think, just a little bit.

869
01:00:41,204 --> 01:00:41,932
You sure, man?

870
01:00:42,005 --> 01:00:42,562
Yeah, yeah.

871
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:43,298
You OK?

872
01:00:43,373 --> 01:00:44,806
Yeah, I' m fine.
It's all good.

873
01:00:44,874 --> 01:00:45,966
All right, man.
Come find us later.

874
01:00:46,042 --> 01:00:49,068
All right, I' II find you later.

875
01:02:08,624 --> 01:02:10,285
- Hey.
- Hey!

876
01:02:10,359 --> 01:02:12,520
What's up?

877
01:02:12,595 --> 01:02:14,256
Nothing. What are you doing?

878
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:15,729
I'm here with Bill.

879
01:02:15,798 --> 01:02:17,322
He's meeting up with Christie.

880
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,389
Yeah, I know.

881
01:02:18,468 --> 01:02:19,867
You're here with Christie?

882
01:02:19,936 --> 01:02:21,631
Yeah.

883
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:27,866
Can I tell you something?

884
01:02:27,944 --> 01:02:28,603
What?

885
01:02:28,678 --> 01:02:30,646
It's kind of stupid.

886
01:02:30,713 --> 01:02:31,372
That's OK.

887
01:02:31,447 --> 01:02:33,642
I'm a little drunk right now.

888
01:02:33,716 --> 01:02:34,410
That's fine.

889
01:02:34,484 --> 01:02:36,384
Just to let you know.

890
01:02:36,452 --> 01:02:37,714
It's OK.

891
01:02:37,787 --> 01:02:41,120
I know it's kind of early and all,
but, you know...

892
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:46,892
Wow.

893
01:02:46,963 --> 01:02:48,726
Do you want to take
some pictures?

894
