1
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:35,134
Midgard rejects
your frozen villainy, ymir,

2
00:00:35,136 --> 00:00:37,002
ice giant of niffleheim.

3
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:40,372
The ice will silence you,
Thor odinson.

4
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:43,776
Yeah. Less talk,
more rock, goldilocks.

5
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:51,316
Speak not to me
of battle tactics, hulk.

6
00:00:51,318 --> 00:00:53,252
I have fought more...

7
00:00:53,254 --> 00:00:56,588
Here's my question:
Why is an ice giant
on monuriki island?

8
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:00,926
I mean, it's not really
an ice-friendly location,
like, say, someplace cold.

9
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:07,066
By the way,
ice is the perfect weapon

10
00:01:07,068 --> 00:01:09,268
because it melts
and leaves no evidence.

11
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,904
Saw that in a movie,
i think.

12
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:17,876
What was that movie?

13
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:19,678
Cap, you know
what I'm talking about.

14
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,280
Stay on task,
iron man.

15
00:01:21,282 --> 00:01:23,515
We need to find that casket
before it's opened.

16
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:25,851
Eternal winter in a box?
Nope, not seeing it.

17
00:01:25,853 --> 00:01:27,586
Would long summer
on a stick work?

18
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:29,788
Ymir and the casket
of ancient winters

19
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,591
are as powerful
as they are old, iron man.

20
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:34,626
<i> Trifle with them</i>
<i> at your peril.</i>

21
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:37,763
I'm not trifling, hammer-time.
I'm judging.

22
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:39,698
Glacier-to-go may be big,
strong,

23
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,700
and handy
when the fridge breaks,

24
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:43,969
but even popsicles know
to stay in the shade.

25
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:46,371
So why is he here?
And how did he get here?

26
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:49,074
I don't know.
This doesn't add up.
Something's off.

27
00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:55,447
And you're off to join it.

28
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:58,951
<i> Whoa! Iron man</i>
<i> just became iron rocket!</i>

29
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:01,954
Is he okay? Should I tag in?
'Cause I can tag in.

30
00:02:01,956 --> 00:02:03,589
Negative, reptil.

31
00:02:03,591 --> 00:02:05,124
You're here to observe
as a trainee.

32
00:02:05,126 --> 00:02:07,126
That's what you do
on a ride-along.

33
00:02:07,128 --> 00:02:09,061
<i> Technically,</i>
<i> it's more of a fly-along.</i>

34
00:02:09,063 --> 00:02:11,163
And I can just
power dive into a--

35
00:02:11,165 --> 00:02:13,132
do not engage, reptil.

36
00:02:13,134 --> 00:02:15,400
Check on the boats out there.
That's an order.

37
00:02:15,402 --> 00:02:18,137
Boats. Yes, sir.

38
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:26,178
Don't go too far, kid.
We're about to wrap this up.

39
00:02:28,582 --> 00:02:32,117
<i> Cap, I have a visual</i>
<i> on the casket.</i>
<i> It's in permafrosty's hand.</i>

40
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:35,420
You make him drop it,
captain marvel.
I'll recover it.

41
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:38,657
Operation fumble is a go.

42
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:41,360
Time to make some ice scream.

43
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:50,769
Get it?
It's a play on words.

44
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:53,972
Not bad, hulk.
I mean, for you.

45
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:56,542
Snowball, corner pocket.

46
00:03:10,191 --> 00:03:11,890
Who do you...

47
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:28,240
What did I do during
the best ice monster
beach brawl ever?

48
00:03:28,242 --> 00:03:30,175
Boat check.

49
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:32,411
Wait. That looks like...

50
00:03:32,413 --> 00:03:34,213
Loki.

51
00:03:34,215 --> 00:03:37,216
Guys, it's reptil.
I think I just spotted--

52
00:03:37,218 --> 00:03:39,151
<i> a little busy right now, son.</i>

53
00:03:40,221 --> 00:03:43,589
I know, but you've
really gotta hear this.

54
00:03:43,591 --> 00:03:45,791
About to lose ya.

55
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:52,564
Well, he did say,
"check on the boats,"
so...

56
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,800
Tagging in!

57
00:03:57,371 --> 00:03:59,504
Drop the scepter, loki.

58
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:02,941
"Drop the scepter, loki,"
or what?

59
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:07,279
Or I'll-- I, uh...

60
00:04:07,281 --> 00:04:08,947
Just drop it.

61
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:12,084
It's a fair question,
childasaurus.

62
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:15,087
Perhaps you should return
when you can answer it.

63
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:17,723
It's over, loki,
one way or the other.

64
00:04:17,725 --> 00:04:21,627
Yes, even the best-laid plans
of immortals go awry,

65
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:23,595
thanks to your friends.

66
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,597
At least we can
agree on that!

67
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:45,050
Hole in the sky!

68
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:50,956
I'm trying to remember
all the positives
of a big hole in the sky.

69
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,291
Nope. There are none.

70
00:04:52,293 --> 00:04:55,661
Okay, cap.
Got a plan for this nightmare?

71
00:04:55,663 --> 00:04:58,163
<i> Cap? Cap?</i>

72
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:08,707
Aah!

73
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:15,814
Where are you,
pesky flea?

74
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:18,283
You can't hide.

75
00:05:30,698 --> 00:05:33,265
Enough ice follies.

76
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:36,368
Need to secure the casket,
and the kid.

77
00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:48,613
Well, I'm afraid this is where
you and I part ways, pre-hero.

78
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:50,849
I, to a new beginning,

79
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:54,019
and you, to oblivion.

80
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:09,901
Whoa! I'll tag out now.
Anybody want in? No?

81
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:17,776
Wait. I can fly.

82
00:06:21,382 --> 00:06:24,182
I can out-flap this skynado,
no problem.

83
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:26,985
Is there any way to do this
without hugging?

84
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:28,987
This hug
is saving your life.

85
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:31,757
Then I'd rather perish.
As would I.

86
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,925
Stop complaining
and hug for your life!

87
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:39,965
There it is.

88
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:42,934
Okay, I've got the casket.

89
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:45,404
Now let's focus on...

90
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:47,606
A much bigger problem.

91
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:49,040
Whoa.

92
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:52,411
Incoming, me!
Gotcha!

93
00:06:52,413 --> 00:06:55,180
Oh, hey, cap.
Mystical vortex troubles?

94
00:06:55,182 --> 00:06:57,716
Funny, we were just
discussing that very topic.

95
00:06:57,718 --> 00:06:59,718
Hulk has
an interesting theory.

96
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,859
No-o-o-o!

97
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:11,096
Had enough, skynado?

98
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,781
Reptil!
He's out cold.

99
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,117
Don't worry.
I got this. Kid!

100
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:34,386
Wake up! Yeah, no good.

101
00:07:34,388 --> 00:07:35,921
Hey, hulk,
how about a little help?

102
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:38,290
Wake u-u-up!

103
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:39,791
Was that hulk?

104
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:43,395
Whoa-oa-oa-oa!

105
00:07:44,465 --> 00:07:47,632
Hey, check it out.
I'm still alive.

106
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:50,302
Yeah!
We did it!

107
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:52,771
And I just invented
dino-boarding.

108
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:56,808
Uh-oh.

109
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,644
And dino-crashing.

110
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:03,181
And full-body dino-trauma.

111
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:08,220
Reptil, you alive?

112
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,361
For my encore, I will pass out.

113
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:24,202
The metal one spoke truth.

114
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:27,038
The island's warmth
made me weak.

115
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,841
It was a poor plan.

116
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:33,378
It was you that failed,
not my plan.

117
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,281
You were to open
the casket of ancient winters

118
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:39,684
in a remote location
so as to avoid detection.

119
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:42,020
Instead,
it was a wasted trip.

120
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,189
The meddlers were fortunate.

121
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:47,292
That may be, but Thor
delivers the casket

122
00:08:47,294 --> 00:08:50,328
to asgard for safekeeping
as we speak.

123
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:55,634
Our new path to conquest
must crush all heroic obstacles.

124
00:08:55,636 --> 00:08:57,869
I know a way.

125
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:01,540
You have an idea?
How refreshing.

126
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:07,445
Apologies, lord of ice.
Please continue.

127
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:14,753
I tell the tale of jolnir.

128
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:17,989
Oh, stop.
I've heard this tale.

129
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:20,559
Jolnir is a silly legend.

130
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:23,695
His kind and generous
winter antics
are a fairy tale

131
00:09:23,697 --> 00:09:27,866
to amuse asgardian children
and gullible frost giants.

132
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:32,404
It's utter nonsense.

133
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:36,908
No. Jolnir is nearly
as ancient as I am,

134
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,644
and just as real.

135
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:45,250
<i> Part frost giant, part elf,</i>

136
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:49,321
<i> jolnir was born</i>
<i> with immense power.</i>

137
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:54,426
<i> But instead of using</i>
<i> that power to rule,</i>

138
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:56,761
<i> he squandered it</i>
<i> on helping those</i>

139
00:09:56,763 --> 00:10:00,098
<i> too young and weak</i>
<i> to help themselves--</i>

140
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,201
<i> children.</i>

141
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:06,605
<i> Today, jolnir</i>
<i> is better known</i>

142
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:08,273
<i> as Santa claus.</i>

143
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,909
<i> And each winter,</i>
<i> he brings gifts </i>

144
00:10:10,911 --> 00:10:13,945
<i> to all the children</i>
<i> of the nine worlds </i>
ho ho ho ho ho ho!

145
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,348
<i> In one night.</i>

146
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:20,785
Such a monumental feat
is impossible

147
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:23,188
to all but him.

148
00:10:23,991 --> 00:10:26,124
Such power.

149
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:29,794
And if we
could harness that power,

150
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:33,565
none on earth could resist.

151
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:38,303
Yes, I am well aware
of Santa claus.

152
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:41,973
Santa claus is beloved,
celebrated.

153
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:45,143
Songs are sung in his name.

154
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,946
Hmm? Using him to dominate

155
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:51,182
the very beings
that adore him...

156
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:54,986
Well, that is just
too devious to resist.

157
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:58,823
I guess there's more to you
than snow and ice,
after all, ymir.

158
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,358
But where will we find him?

159
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:05,096
If the stories are true,
he makes his home in alfheim,

160
00:11:05,098 --> 00:11:07,165
home of the light elves.

161
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:11,136
Ugh, elves. Of course.
I should've known.

162
00:11:11,138 --> 00:11:13,638
But if he's as powerful
as you say,

163
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,675
how could we
usurp that power?

164
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:19,044
We lost one casket.

165
00:11:19,046 --> 00:11:21,513
But there is another--

166
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:24,182
the casket of ancient powers.

167
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:27,218
It can transfer
even the greatest abilities

168
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,388
from one being to another.

169
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,792
And, like jolnir,

170
00:11:33,794 --> 00:11:36,494
it too resides in alfheim.

171
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:40,899
A new path.

172
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:42,701
Misinformation and a reward

173
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:45,236
should flush jolnir
into the open

174
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:48,206
while we seek the casket
of ancient powers.

175
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,542
If no one else finds him,
we will.

176
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:54,245
And then we will
claim his power.

177
00:11:54,247 --> 00:12:00,018
Yes. The hunt is on
for Santa claus.

178
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:12,464
But first, a distraction
for our heroic friends.

179
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:35,820
Huh?

180
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:45,830
Hm. You'll do.

181
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:56,775
Remember your footwork.
Again.

182
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:06,217
Again.

183
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:17,629
Am I still in trouble
for going after loki on my own?

184
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:21,733
You're not in trouble.
You're in training
to join this team someday.

185
00:13:21,735 --> 00:13:24,169
And that won't happen
if you don't learn teamwork.

186
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:27,172
I tried to tell you.
I just...

187
00:13:27,174 --> 00:13:29,440
I wanted you
to believe in me.

188
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:32,977
I figured if I catch loki--
boom, I'm in the game.

189
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:36,281
But you don't act alone
when you're part of a team.

190
00:13:36,283 --> 00:13:38,950
So you're on the bench.

191
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:41,486
Going a little hard on him,
aren't you?

192
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,855
He showed guts.
Guts count too.

193
00:13:43,857 --> 00:13:46,024
Only when they're paired
with brains.

194
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:49,828
Aw, lighten up, cap.
He stepped up to loki,
and he's still here.

195
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,763
Gold star for that.

196
00:13:51,765 --> 00:13:54,165
Did young cap
take no for an answer?

197
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,434
Did young any of us?
No.

198
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:58,636
And we all made mistakes.

199
00:13:58,638 --> 00:14:00,839
Mistakes I'm trying
to help him avoid.

200
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:03,174
He'll learn
from the mistakes.

201
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,876
We did.

202
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:08,012
- Uh, guys? I'm right here.
- He'll be fine.

203
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,848
He's a one-man dino-band.

204
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,183
You know who else
had skills like that?
Dinosaurs.

205
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:15,353
And look how things
turned out for them.
Wait. Bad example.

206
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:18,456
I rest my case.
Guys, still in the room.

207
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:21,960
You wouldn't worry so much
if you had
my new-car shine, cap.

208
00:14:21,962 --> 00:14:24,829
Now pipe down
before the kid hears us.

209
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:28,132
Whoa!
Thor's back already?
That was quick.

210
00:14:28,134 --> 00:14:30,034
No. He said
it would take time

211
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:33,071
to secure
the casket of ancient winters
in asgard.

212
00:14:33,073 --> 00:14:35,240
That was something else.

213
00:14:38,011 --> 00:14:40,678
Tell me you didn't use
my private bathroom again.

214
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,882
I like your shampoo.
Smells like candy canes.

215
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:46,551
Candy? Hulk,
that's not shampoo.

216
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:49,888
That's foot cream. Ugh.

217
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,890
I still like it.

218
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:54,726
Should I come?

219
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:56,895
Guys?

220
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:13,378
Tourist?
He doesn't look local.

221
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:16,080
No, but he's making
himself at home.

222
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:19,918
Not in my house.

223
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,921
Nobody makes a mess
in my house.

224
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:24,923
Except you.

225
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:28,192
Easy, hulk. First priority
is clearing the street.

226
00:15:28,194 --> 00:15:30,361
Get everyone
out of the lizard zone.

227
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:33,531
I'm on it.

228
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:37,201
Don't worry about the Fender.

229
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:38,937
I got that covered.

230
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:57,021
You're welcome.

231
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:01,292
Really? Rampages
make us all look bad,

232
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,962
extra-large dino-noob.

233
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,433
Heads up!

234
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:10,802
You do need to work
on your reflexes.

235
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:11,803
Thanks!

236
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:14,806
You wanna walk away
or fly away.

237
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:17,642
The flying option
involves punching.

238
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:23,982
Have a nice flight!

239
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:26,184
Back already?

240
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,727
Huh?

241
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:40,131
Okay.
So much for that plan.

242
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:42,133
Captain marvel,
you're air support.
Iron man--

243
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:45,470
hold up. I've got
a way to end this,
no rubble required.

244
00:16:45,472 --> 00:16:48,272
Reptil, come here.

245
00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:50,875
What are you doing?
Shh. It's a surprise.
Don't ruin it.

246
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:53,344
Kid, bust out
your best dino-head.

247
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,446
Uh, okay.

248
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:58,683
Does this work?

249
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:00,685
For a job interview
or a date, no.

250
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:03,588
But for this, it's perfect.

251
00:17:05,392 --> 00:17:07,191
Huh?

252
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:10,728
All right.
Look alive, people.

253
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,864
No. Give the kid
some room.
What?

254
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:16,401
But that thing is--
ah-ah-ah.
There's no "but" in "team."

255
00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:18,536
Or something like that.
Just trust me.

256
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:27,045
Uh, so what am i
doing now?

257
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:29,047
You're doing it already.
Keep it up.

258
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:31,883
But I'm not doing anything.
Exactly. Don't move.

259
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:34,719
"Don't move"? But...

260
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:40,124
Hey, it thinks I'm its--
ugh-- baby.

261
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:44,529
Ugh! Ugh!

262
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:46,731
Okay.

263
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:49,333
You can stop licking now.

264
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:51,669
How'd you know
that would work?

265
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:53,738
I didn't.
I just wanted to see
what would happen.

266
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,074
Kidding.

267
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:58,509
It's obvious
that that's a she,

268
00:17:58,511 --> 00:18:00,611
and motherly instincts
are hard to deny.

269
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:02,947
That was a risky play.

270
00:18:02,949 --> 00:18:06,050
High risk, high reward.
It's the only
game worth playing.

271
00:18:06,052 --> 00:18:09,253
- Worth it for you, maybe.
- Not for him.

272
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:11,956
That's what I love about you,
stars and gripes.

273
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:15,059
Your glass
is always half full.
Of sour milk.

274
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:22,533
Is there a plan to--
ugh-- stop the licking?

275
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:24,035
'Cause...

276
00:18:24,037 --> 00:18:26,804
I think I'm gonna be sick.

277
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:31,709
Eighth time's a charm, pal.

278
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:33,945
Honestly,
i feel good about this.

279
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:35,646
I am groot.

280
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:38,483
So when I say, "punch it,"
you punch it.

281
00:18:38,485 --> 00:18:40,818
Got it?

282
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:45,823
And... punch it!

283
00:18:45,825 --> 00:18:48,059
- Power down!
- I am groot.

284
00:18:48,061 --> 00:18:49,660
Power down! Power down.

285
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:51,963
Power down!
Power down!

286
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:54,832
Why'd you punch it?

287
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:57,335
Oh, now the electrical's fried!

288
00:18:57,337 --> 00:18:59,437
I gotta rewire
the whole thing!

289
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:02,540
And I'm out of wire!

290
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:07,678
I'm sick of this
flying scrap heap.

291
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,614
We need a new ship.

292
00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:11,916
I am groot.

293
00:19:11,918 --> 00:19:14,018
I know new ships
cost units.

294
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,520
I am groot.

295
00:19:15,522 --> 00:19:18,589
I know we don't have
any units.

296
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:24,128
But maybe that's
about to change.

297
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:28,699
"Jolnir, a.K.A. Santa claus.
Mass burglary, animal cruelty.

298
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:30,835
Stealing cookies from kids"?

299
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:34,605
Well, this guy's
a real piece of work.
And the reward is...

300
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:36,307
Whoa-ho-ho-ho-ho!

301
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:39,210
Oh, we bag this guy,
and we can buy any ship we want.

302
00:19:39,212 --> 00:19:42,613
Set a course
for this alfheim place.

303
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:57,028
Ah, alfheim,

304
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:00,064
the most joyous
of the nine realms.

305
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:02,733
How can anyone stand
a place this happy?

306
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:04,068
Even elves?

307
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:07,004
Agreed.
It's too warm.

308
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:09,874
Fortunately,
our visit will be short.

309
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:14,645
Now, where in this cursed realm
is the casket of ancient powers?

310
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:16,814
Mmm.

311
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:19,383
I suppose we will just

312
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,919
have to ask
for directions then.

313
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:33,564
Captain, is this
a hero's welcome,
or is treachery afoot?

314
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:36,400
Hard to say.
How'd things go in asgard?

315
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:41,172
All's well.
The casket of ancient winters
is once again in safe hands.

316
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:44,008
Nothing out of the ordinary?

317
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:48,079
Well, there was
one odd development.

318
00:20:52,518 --> 00:20:54,018
What's the emergency?

319
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,520
Please tell me loki
didn't steal back that icebox.

320
00:20:56,522 --> 00:20:58,923
No. We believe loki
has moved on

321
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:00,925
to a far more
sinister plan.

322
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:02,860
"We" is an overstatement.

323
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:06,264
Let's look at the facts.
Tony, the lizard attack.

324
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:08,099
Is there some footage
you can--

325
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:11,302
boom. Jarvis.
We know a creature
attacked the city today,

326
00:21:11,304 --> 00:21:13,904
and we know that despite
its size and strength,

327
00:21:13,906 --> 00:21:15,806
we defeated it easily.

328
00:21:15,808 --> 00:21:18,476
Too easily.
Thor and I believe--

329
00:21:18,478 --> 00:21:20,578
uh, he believes.
I, less so.

330
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:24,949
...that loki sent the creature
to distract us
from his true scheme,

331
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:27,551
which Thor discovered
while in asgard.

332
00:21:27,553 --> 00:21:28,886
Thor?

333
00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:31,956
I thought it less a scheme
and more a jest.

334
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,292
Loki accuses someone
of false crimes

335
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:37,128
and offers a great reward
for his capture.

336
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,730
Loki's target has many names.

337
00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:41,966
In asgard, he is jolnir.

338
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:45,636
Here, he is known
as Santa claus.

339
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,972
Santa claus.

340
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:49,974
Santa!

341
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:53,110
Red suit, white beard?

342
00:21:53,112 --> 00:21:55,846
Belly like a bowl full of jelly?
Drives a flying sleigh?

343
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,284
Reindeer with
a glow-in-the-dark nose?

344
00:22:00,286 --> 00:22:04,422
Whoo! A Santa bounty.
Too funny.

345
00:22:04,424 --> 00:22:07,958
Really? Just Thor and me?
Come on. You can't be serious.

346
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,360
Don't I look serious?

347
00:22:09,362 --> 00:22:11,696
Sure. But you always
look like that.

348
00:22:11,698 --> 00:22:16,167
For good reason.
It may sound funny,
but Santa claus is no joke.

349
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:20,004
No? Jarvis,
can you walk us through
the physics of Santa?

350
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:22,606
The simple version.
<i> It would be my pleasure.</i>

351
00:22:22,608 --> 00:22:26,777
<i> For simplicity, we'll assume</i>
<i> there are two billion children</i>
<i> on earth.</i>

352
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:30,014
<i> Using a census average</i>
<i> of 3.5 children per home,</i>

353
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:33,884
<i> that's 571 million homes</i>
<i> for Santa to visit</i>
<i> in only one day,</i>

354
00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:37,555
<i> or 31 hours,</i>
<i> accounting for time zones</i>
<i> and the earth's rotation.</i>

355
00:22:37,557 --> 00:22:42,993
<i> This would require Santa</i>
<i> to visit 5,116.5 houses</i>
<i> per second</i>

356
00:22:42,995 --> 00:22:46,964
<i> while traveling</i>
<i> at 4,043 miles per second</i>
<i> between stops.</i>

357
00:22:46,966 --> 00:22:50,134
<i> Now, the sheer volume</i>
<i> of pres-- </i>
that's enough, Jarvis.

358
00:22:50,136 --> 00:22:52,670
Point is, it's impossible.

359
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,372
But I knew that as a kid.
Off.

360
00:22:54,374 --> 00:22:56,474
Wait!
Not that it takes a genius
to figure out

361
00:22:56,476 --> 00:23:00,444
this scam is impossible.
Nothing is impossible
if you believe.

362
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:05,549
Uh, sorry.

363
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:09,754
Regardless, it may be that Santa
has incredible power.

364
00:23:09,756 --> 00:23:11,889
Enough to bend space-time.

365
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:14,759
Loki could use
the casket of ancient powers

366
00:23:14,761 --> 00:23:16,761
to claim jolnir's power.

367
00:23:16,763 --> 00:23:18,763
Both are said to be in alfheim.

368
00:23:18,765 --> 00:23:20,765
But this has gone too far.

369
00:23:20,767 --> 00:23:24,001
Jolnir is just a legend,
a myth.

370
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:26,437
Kind of like you,
Thor from asgard?

371
00:23:26,439 --> 00:23:28,439
Fine. Maybe this guy's
Thor's cousin.

372
00:23:28,441 --> 00:23:32,176
But he's not Santa,
because there is no Santa.

373
00:23:32,178 --> 00:23:35,413
I'll take a trip
to prove I'm right.
Let's go to alfheim.

374
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:39,250
Heimdall won't open the Bifrost
to mortals for such folly,

375
00:23:39,252 --> 00:23:41,218
- nor should he.
- No problem.

376
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,421
We don't need
your rainbow bridge
when we've got

377
00:23:43,423 --> 00:23:46,924
my dimensional gateway
transporter bridge thingamajig.

378
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:50,227
I'm still working
on the name.
This is a fool's errand.

379
00:23:50,229 --> 00:23:53,264
So stay here.
Someone has to work on plan b--

380
00:23:53,266 --> 00:23:56,467
doing Santa's job
if something goes wrong.

381
00:23:56,469 --> 00:23:58,469
You can do that
with hulk.

382
00:23:58,471 --> 00:24:00,271
Ho ho ho!

383
00:24:00,273 --> 00:24:03,107
We'll have
a Holly jolly time.

384
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:05,776
Your device is real?
We're going on a Santa quest,

385
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:08,479
and you're asking
if my tech is real?
Fine.

386
00:24:08,481 --> 00:24:10,147
Has it been tested?

387
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:14,518
Sure. Phase one of testing
started... now.

388
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:22,126
Joy to another world,
huh, kid?

389
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:23,461
Yes!

390
00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:26,497
We're gonna
meet Santa claus!

391
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:40,644
Are you well, sir?
Do you require aid?

392
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:45,249
Oh. Who takes pity
on these old, cold bones?

393
00:24:45,251 --> 00:24:48,752
Commander athidel,
of the emerald guard,
at your service.

394
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,089
Loki!

395
00:24:52,091 --> 00:24:54,792
Good eye, commander athidel.

396
00:24:54,794 --> 00:24:56,627
So kind of you to offer help.

397
00:24:56,629 --> 00:25:02,500
But I fear you are in
far greater need of it than I.

398
00:25:02,502 --> 00:25:03,534
Hmm?

399
00:25:05,037 --> 00:25:08,506
Oh!

400
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:12,510
Now, would you mind
directing us

401
00:25:12,512 --> 00:25:15,212
to the nearest
casket of ancient powers?

402
00:25:15,214 --> 00:25:18,616
And I'm afraid we're in
a bit of a rush.

403
00:25:18,618 --> 00:25:21,886
Look, I'm just saying
i know Santa claus.

404
00:25:21,888 --> 00:25:25,523
The stories, the songs,
all the reindeer names.

405
00:25:25,525 --> 00:25:28,025
I'm a Santa freak.

406
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:30,194
I could be a big help
on this mission.

407
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:33,664
This isn't
a training mission.
I know.

408
00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:36,166
No one gets what's at stake here
more than me.

409
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:38,202
Santa has to be saved.

410
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:40,671
That's why I want to go.
Need to go.

411
00:25:40,673 --> 00:25:44,708
And, hey, if I meet Santa
and become his best friend,
I'm fine with that.

412
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:47,511
I'm sold.
Too bad it's not my call.

413
00:25:47,513 --> 00:25:51,348
No, it's mine.
And I'm afraid I've made it.

414
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:54,552
We'll resume your training
when this is resolved, humberto.

415
00:25:54,554 --> 00:25:57,888
I'm surprised, cap.
Kid believes in this stuff.

416
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,390
I believe it's a sham.

417
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:01,859
At the very least,
his attitude offsets mine.

418
00:26:01,861 --> 00:26:05,029
If there was ever a mission
for him to join, this is it.

419
00:26:05,031 --> 00:26:06,730
Fine, fine.
He can go.

420
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:07,898
Really?

421
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,266
Yeah, really?

422
00:26:09,268 --> 00:26:11,168
Really. As your shadow.

423
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:13,270
Ooh. Walked into that one.

424
00:26:13,272 --> 00:26:16,073
Yes! I promise
you won't regret this.

425
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:17,942
Unless I screw up.
Which I won't.

426
00:26:17,944 --> 00:26:20,878
If you do,
you'll never see earth again.

427
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,880
- Just kidding.
- Iron high five.

428
00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:25,683
What I don't get is,

429
00:26:25,685 --> 00:26:28,452
if you think
this trip's a loser,
why make it happen?

430
00:26:28,454 --> 00:26:31,288
Because I'm always right,
and it's my duty to prove that.

431
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:33,958
Or you have no holiday plans.

432
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:37,261
Because I'm selfless too.
We're clear for takeoff.

433
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:40,230
By the way,
there's a small chance
we'll get separated.

434
00:26:40,232 --> 00:26:42,399
And by "we,"
i mean our molecules.

435
00:26:42,401 --> 00:26:44,401
What's the likelihood
of this gizmo

436
00:26:44,403 --> 00:26:47,438
actually getting us
to alfheim?

437
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,206
Hmm. 100%.

438
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:53,911
<i> The likelihood of reaching</i>
<i> alfheim safely is 78%.</i>

439
00:26:53,913 --> 00:26:57,715
Which, if you round up,
is basically a hundred percent.

440
00:26:57,717 --> 00:27:00,751
Not cool, Jarvis.
We agreed to use fuzzy math.

441
00:27:00,753 --> 00:27:04,088
<i> I said "math."</i>
<i> You added "fuzzy."</i>

442
00:27:12,498 --> 00:27:14,932
Wait. Are those cookie trees?

443
00:27:14,934 --> 00:27:17,568
Yeah. They look good.

444
00:27:18,671 --> 00:27:21,038
But I just lost
my appetite.

445
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:25,843
See? Safe and sound.

446
00:27:25,845 --> 00:27:29,446
Sure, there's an army
of angry Archer elves
targeting us,

447
00:27:29,448 --> 00:27:31,982
but we get
souvenir glow arrows.

448
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:33,484
That's a win in my book.

449
00:27:33,486 --> 00:27:36,787
I am malitri,
captain of the emerald guard.

450
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:41,025
You will release
commander athidel
by the count of three.

451
00:27:41,027 --> 00:27:42,860
One--
wait a second.

452
00:27:42,862 --> 00:27:44,595
We don't have this commander.

453
00:27:44,597 --> 00:27:45,929
Cap, let me handle this.

454
00:27:45,931 --> 00:27:51,135
Forsooth, good malitrio,
light elf of the light elves.

455
00:27:51,137 --> 00:27:53,837
We know not of whence
hence you speak.

456
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:59,510
We instead seek to query you
on a quandary most dire.

457
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:04,348
Your mockery is a path
that leads only to woe,

458
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:07,051
armored interloper,
for you.

459
00:28:07,053 --> 00:28:09,053
No, no, my spritely comrade.

460
00:28:09,055 --> 00:28:11,855
Your pointy-eth ears
have-- hath mistrewn-eth

461
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:15,626
the words coming from my--
mine yon lips, and...

462
00:28:15,628 --> 00:28:19,063
Look, ear-kabobs,
fancy talk isn't my thing.

463
00:28:19,065 --> 00:28:22,066
But you'd love my pal Thor.
Why didn't we bring Thor again?

464
00:28:22,068 --> 00:28:23,734
This is right
in his wheelhouse.

465
00:28:23,736 --> 00:28:26,003
I grow weary
of this one's prattle.

466
00:28:26,005 --> 00:28:27,571
Dispatch him.

467
00:28:27,573 --> 00:28:30,641
You don't want
to fancy-talk it out?
Fine. Dispatch this.

468
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:34,778
Wait. Where'd he go?

469
00:28:37,249 --> 00:28:40,217
Emerald guards,
capture them,

470
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:42,152
by any means necessary.

471
00:28:49,361 --> 00:28:52,262
Time to separate the boys
from the other boys.

472
00:29:02,108 --> 00:29:04,108
Whoa. Let's start over.

473
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:06,176
We're here
to protect Santa claus.

474
00:29:06,178 --> 00:29:08,045
You call him jolnir.

475
00:29:08,047 --> 00:29:10,280
The emerald guard
protects jolnir.

476
00:29:10,282 --> 00:29:13,383
We do not require
the help of outlanders.

477
00:29:13,385 --> 00:29:15,385
The point is, same team.

478
00:29:15,387 --> 00:29:19,757
The other team, loki and ymir--
they have a head start.

479
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:23,427
Loki and ymir are
a most treacherous threat.

480
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:27,297
A threat we are more than able
to counter on our own.

481
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:28,966
I believe you.

482
00:29:28,968 --> 00:29:31,368
It's not like your commander
is missing or anything.

483
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:35,472
Loki and ymir may be
using your commander

484
00:29:35,474 --> 00:29:37,808
to find
the casket of ancient powers.

485
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:42,079
If so, we need to work together
and get there first.
Sing it, cap.

486
00:29:42,081 --> 00:29:44,381
Why would we
trust outlanders?

487
00:29:44,383 --> 00:29:47,785
Because Santa's safety
is at risk.

488
00:29:47,787 --> 00:29:50,187
Nothing else matters.

489
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:55,526
Follow us.

490
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:58,962
Um, how'd you do that?

491
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:02,466
No idea.
Pretty cool,
though, right?

492
00:30:02,468 --> 00:30:05,636
They must think you're an elf.
Easy mistake.

493
00:30:08,073 --> 00:30:11,141
I remain perplexed.
By what?

494
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:13,010
Why a sleigh?
Why reindeer?

495
00:30:13,012 --> 00:30:16,246
And why must the gifts
all be delivered in one night?

496
00:30:16,248 --> 00:30:18,148
Well, it's the holidays.

497
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:20,484
And you like this?

498
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:24,154
Like it? I love it.
Wanna know why?

499
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:28,492
Yes. That's what I've been
asking you to explain
for hours.

500
00:30:28,494 --> 00:30:31,695
Okay. This is why
Christmas rocks.

501
00:30:31,697 --> 00:30:33,797
You've heard of Santa,
right?

502
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:35,866
Yes, of course, hulk.

503
00:30:35,868 --> 00:30:38,669
Okay. Just making sure
for your sake.

504
00:30:38,671 --> 00:30:42,673
So, there's Santa and presents,
which kids love, of course.

505
00:30:42,675 --> 00:30:45,342
Anyway, now, Santa--
he can fly.

506
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:47,277
And presents can be anything.

507
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:50,347
A toy pony, a real pony,
or anything.

508
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:52,983
Not just ponies.
Maybe I should start over.

509
00:30:52,985 --> 00:30:56,520
Nah, I'll keep going.
So, there's Santa,
and then there's pre--

510
00:30:56,522 --> 00:30:58,522
did I say that already?
I can't remember.

511
00:30:58,524 --> 00:31:01,024
Also, there's songs,
cookies, sleigh bells,

512
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:04,061
sweaters, pine trees,
big socks, snowmen,

513
00:31:04,063 --> 00:31:06,029
pie, and then--

514
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:08,899
boom!

515
00:31:08,901 --> 00:31:13,737
It's the next morning,
and you're sitting
on a brand-new pony.

516
00:31:13,739 --> 00:31:17,541
That was of no help
whatsoever, hulk.

517
00:31:20,346 --> 00:31:23,914
Looks like you picked the right
wormhole for alfheim, groot.

518
00:31:23,916 --> 00:31:27,084
I owe you a burrito.

519
00:31:27,086 --> 00:31:28,819
I am groot.

520
00:31:28,821 --> 00:31:31,488
What kind of twisted
fever dream is this place?

521
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,793
What, do they grow
gingerbread men here?

522
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:39,229
I am groot.

523
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:41,465
Yeah, you would like it.

524
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:47,404
File says this jolnir/santa guy
drives a sleigh.

525
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:50,941
So, find the sleigh,
find Santa.

526
00:32:03,122 --> 00:32:06,490
Hey, don't eat that.
It's probably stale.

527
00:32:17,036 --> 00:32:19,670
I am groot!

528
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:32,249
Great. See what you did?
You made the gingerbread rise.

529
00:32:32,251 --> 00:32:36,286
Well, one thing to do
when you're stuck
in a cookie jar-- chew 'em up!

530
00:32:53,172 --> 00:32:55,238
There.
Nothing but crumbs.

531
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,140
What the sprinkles...

532
00:32:58,644 --> 00:33:01,845
Perfect. Zombie cookies.

533
00:33:01,847 --> 00:33:03,513
Come on.

534
00:33:03,515 --> 00:33:06,883
Let's run,
run fast as we can!

535
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:19,329
Cursed cave!

536
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:23,000
Athidel, if the casket
is much further,

537
00:33:23,002 --> 00:33:26,503
ymir may share
his discomfort with you.

538
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:28,839
Our destination is near.

539
00:33:28,841 --> 00:33:31,842
Aah! Wretched rocks!

540
00:33:31,844 --> 00:33:35,078
I hope so.
For your sake.

541
00:33:36,782 --> 00:33:39,516
Think we'll find the casket
before loki?

542
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:42,386
What happens
if they find it first?

543
00:33:42,388 --> 00:33:44,388
And how far
do these tunnels go?

544
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:47,391
No one knows.
Those who venture too far

545
00:33:47,393 --> 00:33:50,394
or lose their way
never return.

546
00:33:50,396 --> 00:33:52,629
Glad I asked.

547
00:33:52,631 --> 00:33:54,965
I'm not.
Me neither.

548
00:33:54,967 --> 00:33:59,736
Should we be leaving
a trail of bread crumbs?
Or flares, maybe?

549
00:33:59,738 --> 00:34:02,606
Less talk, more walk, people.

550
00:34:04,676 --> 00:34:07,644
There.
There is what you seek.

551
00:34:07,646 --> 00:34:12,149
That's it? The casket
of ancient powers?

552
00:34:12,151 --> 00:34:14,851
You leave it unguarded?

553
00:34:14,853 --> 00:34:17,888
No. The casket's ward
is the jorokraken.

554
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:21,491
And where
is the jorokraken now?

555
00:34:21,493 --> 00:34:25,562
Where he always is.
Beneath our feet.

556
00:34:36,742 --> 00:34:39,242
Aah!

557
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:43,547
And he's never been fond
of uninvited guests.

558
00:34:43,549 --> 00:34:45,715
Elfworld
is on a fault line?

559
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:50,053
Whoa. No one said anything
about tunnel quakes.

560
00:34:50,055 --> 00:34:54,091
That disturbance was caused
by the movement
of the jorokraken.

561
00:34:54,093 --> 00:34:57,394
Jorokraken?
Sounds delightful.
What is it?

562
00:34:57,396 --> 00:35:01,798
The jorokraken
is a great ancient beast
that skulks in the rocky depths.

563
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,601
It is a friend
to the light elves
and jealously defends

564
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:07,404
the casket of ancient powers
from all who dare seek it.

565
00:35:07,406 --> 00:35:11,074
That means
loki's found the casket.
Let's move.

566
00:35:16,248 --> 00:35:19,649
Back, vile tentacles!

567
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:26,389
This creature is relentless!

568
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:29,960
Aah!
And rude. Very rude.

569
00:35:32,231 --> 00:35:35,932
No! No! Stop it! Bad!

570
00:35:35,934 --> 00:35:40,437
Alfheim protects jolnir
against all trespassers.

571
00:35:42,241 --> 00:35:45,642
Your fates were sealed
the moment you dared
plot against him.

572
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:49,513
I bid you farewell
on your journey
to oblivion.

573
00:36:01,527 --> 00:36:05,095
Even the most savage beast
can learn manners

574
00:36:05,097 --> 00:36:07,664
when given
the proper motivation.

575
00:36:24,616 --> 00:36:27,150
You were saying?

576
00:36:27,152 --> 00:36:28,652
Use care.

577
00:36:28,654 --> 00:36:31,021
If you open the casket
without a target,

578
00:36:31,023 --> 00:36:33,657
it will siphon your powers.

579
00:36:33,659 --> 00:36:35,458
As I assumed.

580
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:39,296
I haven't made it this far
on charm alone, cold friend.

581
00:36:39,298 --> 00:36:41,298
You will never reach jolnir.

582
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:44,534
And even if you do,
he is far too powerful for you.

583
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:50,807
That, my stalwart Santa sentry,
is why we needed the box.

584
00:36:56,014 --> 00:36:58,381
Fool!
You'll trap us all!

585
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:00,383
Wrong again.

586
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:03,620
This just isn't your day.

587
00:37:06,358 --> 00:37:08,792
No-o-o-o!

588
00:37:10,829 --> 00:37:12,729
Get clear!

589
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:16,766
Biggest tremor yet.
We're almost there.

590
00:37:16,768 --> 00:37:18,835
Or it's already here.

591
00:37:26,612 --> 00:37:28,178
Loki sent us a present.

592
00:37:32,884 --> 00:37:34,818
Why can't I ever be wrong?

593
00:37:48,267 --> 00:37:50,734
Keep pushing.
There has to be a weakness.

594
00:37:57,276 --> 00:38:00,610
Apparently
it's called a whistle.

595
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:02,779
You trained the jorokraken?

596
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:06,783
This relic held sway
over the jorokraken
when we found it.

597
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:08,652
We know not how,

598
00:38:08,654 --> 00:38:11,087
but we remain grateful
for its existence.

599
00:38:11,089 --> 00:38:14,090
You and us both.
What happened to loki
and ymir?

600
00:38:14,092 --> 00:38:17,394
They escaped with the casket
and left me sealed in.

601
00:38:17,396 --> 00:38:20,730
Fortunately, my knowledge
of the hidden passages
allowed me to escape.

602
00:38:20,732 --> 00:38:22,832
These tunnels
have secret tunnels?

603
00:38:22,834 --> 00:38:25,568
- That's just too much tunnel.
- They're on the move.

604
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:27,103
Where is jolnir?

605
00:38:27,105 --> 00:38:30,640
Jolnir calls the top
of mount jolly home.

606
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:32,976
Of course.
I was gonna guess that.

607
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:35,111
We need to get there, now.

608
00:38:35,113 --> 00:38:38,682
The emerald guard does not
allow outlanders on mount jolly.

609
00:38:38,684 --> 00:38:41,818
Yeah? Tell that
to freezy and sleazy.

610
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,254
We will, vigorously.

611
00:38:44,256 --> 00:38:47,657
Look, this isn't a turf war.
We want to help.

612
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:50,260
And since you coughed up
that power box,

613
00:38:50,262 --> 00:38:52,329
seems like you guys
could use it.

614
00:38:54,533 --> 00:38:56,800
Think it over,
long-bow short-fuse.

615
00:38:56,802 --> 00:38:59,669
Thank you.
We decline your offer.

616
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:02,472
It's not an offer.
There's too much at stake.

617
00:39:02,474 --> 00:39:05,175
We're going.
You don't have to help us.

618
00:39:05,177 --> 00:39:07,377
But we won't let you
stop us.

619
00:39:13,318 --> 00:39:15,652
Yay. Happy ending.

620
00:39:15,654 --> 00:39:17,854
Sorry. Excuse me.
Pardon me.

621
00:39:19,324 --> 00:39:21,725
How could you
let them pass?

622
00:39:21,727 --> 00:39:25,095
What we began,
our brothers will finish.

623
00:39:30,235 --> 00:39:32,302
Season's greetings!

624
00:39:32,304 --> 00:39:35,004
I'm Nicholas,
store manager.

625
00:39:35,006 --> 00:39:36,873
But, please,
call me Nick.

626
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:39,209
What can I help you find today?

627
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:42,178
We seek playthings
and trinkets of amusement

628
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,913
for the children
of this world.

629
00:39:43,915 --> 00:39:46,716
Ho ho ho!
You're in the right place.

630
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:50,820
Toy to the world
has the widest selection
of toys in the world.

631
00:39:50,822 --> 00:39:54,224
Toy cars, toy planes...
Why does this man
seem familiar?

632
00:39:54,226 --> 00:39:58,027
'Cause he looks
like Santa claus?
No.

633
00:39:58,029 --> 00:40:01,331
...toy saws, toy clocks--
Nick, have we met
in the past?

634
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:03,266
Um, no.

635
00:40:03,268 --> 00:40:06,736
I'd remember you.
Ho ho ho ho ho ho!

636
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:08,738
The laugh?
The beard?

637
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:11,374
Come on.
Santa claus.

638
00:40:11,376 --> 00:40:14,978
Nick, have you ever
journeyed to asgard?

639
00:40:15,947 --> 00:40:18,348
Um, is that overseas?

640
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:22,452
Yes. Over seas, lands,
space, and time.

641
00:40:23,455 --> 00:40:26,356
Santa. Claus.

642
00:40:26,358 --> 00:40:30,126
Of course!
The resemblance is uncanny!

643
00:40:30,128 --> 00:40:33,229
So, are you looking
for a specific toy?

644
00:40:33,231 --> 00:40:35,565
Yeah. All of them.

645
00:40:35,567 --> 00:40:40,103
Indeed. We require
every toy you possess.

646
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:41,905
Charge it all
to Tony stark.

647
00:40:41,907 --> 00:40:43,606
And you, Nick.

648
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:47,477
I believe we require
you as well.

649
00:41:00,926 --> 00:41:03,626
That's him.
Rotten, low-life crook.

650
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:04,994
Let's grab him,
quick and quiet,

651
00:41:04,996 --> 00:41:07,130
and get out
of this snow globe.

652
00:41:07,132 --> 00:41:09,833
Place gives me the creeps.
And stop eating
those gumdrops!

653
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:20,643
End of the trail,
Santa claus!

654
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:29,986
Nothing personal,
just business.

655
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:32,755
You're worth a whole lot
of loot to somebody.

656
00:41:32,757 --> 00:41:34,591
Actually,
it is a bit personal!

657
00:41:34,593 --> 00:41:37,093
Taking cookies from kids?
How do you sleep at night?

658
00:41:39,865 --> 00:41:42,398
What?
Groot, lose the scarf.

659
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:49,038
I said,
"I'm afraid you've got
the wrong claus."

660
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,441
I'm Mrs. claus,

661
00:41:51,443 --> 00:41:53,343
Santa's wife.

662
00:41:54,145 --> 00:41:56,212
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

663
00:41:57,015 --> 00:41:59,148
Oh, I wish.

664
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:01,150
Oh, but I'm not much
of a jokester.

665
00:42:01,152 --> 00:42:03,353
Not like you two.

666
00:42:03,355 --> 00:42:06,456
I mean, this prank--
what a hoot!

667
00:42:06,458 --> 00:42:09,559
I'm so sorry I spoiled it.

668
00:42:09,561 --> 00:42:11,694
"Prank"?
Sure.

669
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:15,698
Pretending to be bandits,
leaping out to catch Santa.

670
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,667
Delightful!

671
00:42:17,669 --> 00:42:20,537
Hop in. I'll give you
a ride to our place.

672
00:42:20,539 --> 00:42:23,606
Santa loves it
when old friends drop by.

673
00:42:24,676 --> 00:42:26,376
Eh...

674
00:42:26,378 --> 00:42:30,046
Yeah. Yeah, we're old friends
here to play a prank on Santa.

675
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:32,549
You saw right through us.

676
00:42:32,551 --> 00:42:35,952
Come on, groot.
This sweet old lady's
gonna help us bag her husband.

677
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:41,991
So, how far are we-e-e-e...

678
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:50,099
We know jolnir is up there.

679
00:42:50,101 --> 00:42:52,302
Why do we cower here
like rodents?

680
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:57,674
Ugh! I'm unable to open
a portal on that mountain.

681
00:42:57,676 --> 00:43:00,610
It's shrouded in magic--
jolnir's magic.

682
00:43:00,612 --> 00:43:04,914
And there are
certainly more defenses
than the light elves we see.

683
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:06,749
So why confront them ourselves

684
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:10,887
when we can let
our willing decoys
do it for us?

685
00:43:10,889 --> 00:43:12,755
What decoys?

686
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:15,258
Those decoys.

687
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:17,527
Heroes.

688
00:43:17,529 --> 00:43:20,129
They're more reliable
than clocks.

689
00:43:22,434 --> 00:43:24,667
Halt.
Come no closer.

690
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:27,437
We have no choice.

691
00:43:27,439 --> 00:43:31,107
We need to reach jolnir
before it's too late.
Stand down.

692
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:33,776
You give no orders here,
outlander.

693
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:35,578
Maybe we should
let humberto talk.

694
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:37,747
That worked last time.
Just an idea.

695
00:43:37,749 --> 00:43:39,749
It's okay, guys.
If I was identical

696
00:43:39,751 --> 00:43:42,418
to everyone around me,
I'd be tense too.

697
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:46,055
Now take a hike so,
you know,
we can take a hike.

698
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:52,629
So, Santa's elves
make toys and weapons.

699
00:43:53,465 --> 00:43:55,632
Want to let humberto
talk now?

700
00:43:55,634 --> 00:43:57,967
Uh, might be too late.

701
00:43:57,969 --> 00:44:00,136
Agreed.
We're past talking.

702
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:02,538
Reptil, stay close
to iron man.

703
00:44:05,744 --> 00:44:10,113
Try to keep up, kid.
Last one to the top
cleans up the mess.

704
00:44:10,115 --> 00:44:14,050
Go easy.
We're on the same side.
Not sure they got that memo.

705
00:44:20,025 --> 00:44:21,491
Get clear!

706
00:44:23,128 --> 00:44:25,328
Yeah. They're not
blowing kisses at us.

707
00:44:28,266 --> 00:44:30,733
Incoming at 1:00!

708
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:33,936
3:00! 10:00!

709
00:44:33,938 --> 00:44:35,972
7:00! 8:00 and 9:00!

710
00:44:35,974 --> 00:44:39,542
Got it, kid.
Around-the-clock arrow-rama.

711
00:44:42,213 --> 00:44:44,647
Propulsion's off-line.
Going down.

712
00:44:54,292 --> 00:44:56,693
I'm okay.
Good. Stay put.

713
00:44:56,695 --> 00:44:59,429
No problem,
since I can't move.

714
00:45:02,233 --> 00:45:04,567
Air support headed your way.

715
00:45:07,706 --> 00:45:10,139
Snow down, fellas!

716
00:45:11,076 --> 00:45:13,042
Captain marvel, boost.

717
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:14,777
Got it!

718
00:45:22,554 --> 00:45:25,888
Reptil, tail!

719
00:45:27,025 --> 00:45:30,059
What? Did you say
"tail" or "whale"?

720
00:45:30,061 --> 00:45:32,261
"Tail." Got it.

721
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:42,138
Something's happening.

722
00:45:46,211 --> 00:45:49,078
Santa's gone.

723
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,913
I can't believe it.

724
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:53,783
Looks like dirt squid
called it a day too.

725
00:45:53,785 --> 00:45:56,185
I guess they're
a holiday package deal.

726
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:04,627
Too bad the elves
weren't part of that package.

727
00:46:04,629 --> 00:46:07,697
So we're not
gonna meet Santa?

728
00:46:12,403 --> 00:46:15,605
I'm, uh, not so sure
this is a good idea, guys.

729
00:46:15,607 --> 00:46:18,741
Nonsense, Nick.
You were born
for this endeavor.

730
00:46:18,743 --> 00:46:21,611
In this sleigh,
you will bring hope and joy

731
00:46:21,613 --> 00:46:23,613
to children everywhere.
Oh.

732
00:46:23,615 --> 00:46:26,783
Well, that sounds
pretty good. Ugh!

733
00:46:26,785 --> 00:46:29,952
Are we ready
for a test flight?

734
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:31,621
Sky looks clear.

735
00:46:31,623 --> 00:46:35,625
And your helmet wings
look like antlers if you squint.

736
00:46:36,961 --> 00:46:38,661
Wait. Flight?

737
00:46:38,663 --> 00:46:40,730
That was a joke, right?

738
00:46:40,732 --> 00:46:44,801
Flying terrifies me-e-e!

739
00:46:48,773 --> 00:46:51,641
You will wait
for commander athidel.

740
00:46:51,643 --> 00:46:54,243
No, thank you.
No more waiting.

741
00:46:54,245 --> 00:46:57,146
It's time to say good night.
Follow my lead.

742
00:46:57,148 --> 00:46:59,148
Wait. Please,
just hear me out.

743
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:01,951
You elves are sworn
to protect Santa.

744
00:47:01,953 --> 00:47:06,355
But Santa's gone,
so... we're all good, right?

745
00:47:10,962 --> 00:47:13,830
Whew.
Seriously, what is that?
Dino-hypnotism?

746
00:47:13,832 --> 00:47:16,098
You think I know?
No one listens to me.

747
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:18,301
You don't listen to me.
It's not personal.

748
00:47:18,303 --> 00:47:20,303
- Who listens to kids?
- We do.

749
00:47:20,305 --> 00:47:22,672
And the young one
speaks true.

750
00:47:22,674 --> 00:47:26,843
Jolnir has departed,
eliminating the cause
for conflict between us.

751
00:47:26,845 --> 00:47:28,344
You're free to go.

752
00:47:28,346 --> 00:47:29,879
Yeah, yeah.
I get that part.

753
00:47:29,881 --> 00:47:31,881
But why do you guys
only listen to the kid?

754
00:47:31,883 --> 00:47:35,685
The greater the youth,
the greater the truth.

755
00:47:35,687 --> 00:47:38,521
Indeed.
Youth is an asset.

756
00:47:38,523 --> 00:47:41,357
The young are dear to jolnir.
But more importantly,

757
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:44,327
we light elves can sense
who believes in jolnir

758
00:47:44,329 --> 00:47:46,128
and who does not.

759
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:47,663
Humberto believes.

760
00:47:47,665 --> 00:47:50,166
And we trust the words
of a believer.

761
00:47:50,168 --> 00:47:52,034
How'd he know my name?

762
00:47:52,036 --> 00:47:53,703
You think I know?

763
00:47:53,705 --> 00:47:57,173
So where is jolnir?
Where did he go?

764
00:47:57,175 --> 00:48:00,543
The time of giving--
when jolnir distributes gifts

765
00:48:00,545 --> 00:48:03,312
to the children
of the nine realms--
is at hand.

766
00:48:03,314 --> 00:48:07,316
It begins on the world
closest to ours, midgard,

767
00:48:07,318 --> 00:48:09,752
in a remote location
of jolnir's choosing.

768
00:48:09,754 --> 00:48:12,989
I believe you call it
the north pole.

769
00:48:12,991 --> 00:48:14,690
Ha! I knew it!

770
00:48:14,692 --> 00:48:17,226
That's loki's next target.
We need to get there now.

771
00:48:17,228 --> 00:48:19,228
Regretfully,
we cannot join you.

772
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:23,099
Per jolnir's wishes,
our duties end when
the time of giving begins.

773
00:48:23,101 --> 00:48:27,770
So even Santa's elves
get the holidays off.
But not us. Nice.

774
00:48:27,772 --> 00:48:31,073
Evil doesn't observe holidays.
Let's roll.

775
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:33,876
Isn't this a hoot?

776
00:48:37,615 --> 00:48:40,583
I am groot, I am groot,
i am groot!

777
00:48:40,585 --> 00:48:42,718
What's that?

778
00:48:44,255 --> 00:48:46,923
It's a ramp! Why?

779
00:48:46,925 --> 00:48:49,759
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

780
00:48:49,761 --> 00:48:52,695
Aaaahhhh!

781
00:49:01,239 --> 00:49:02,838
Here we are.

782
00:49:04,876 --> 00:49:07,310
Oh, snickerdoodles!

783
00:49:07,312 --> 00:49:09,312
We must've just missed him.

784
00:49:09,314 --> 00:49:11,547
Don't worry.
I know where he is.

785
00:49:11,549 --> 00:49:13,616
I'll have us there
in no time.

786
00:49:13,618 --> 00:49:15,618
No!

787
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:18,888
I mean, no,
you've been so kind.

788
00:49:18,890 --> 00:49:20,957
We've imposed enough
on you.

789
00:49:20,959 --> 00:49:22,558
We have a ship.

790
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:25,461
If you could just tell us
where we can find him.

791
00:49:25,463 --> 00:49:28,931
A ship?
How wonderful!

792
00:49:28,933 --> 00:49:31,133
I've always wanted
to fly a ship.

793
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:32,635
Let's go!

794
00:49:32,637 --> 00:49:35,805
I am groo-oo-oot!

795
00:49:37,241 --> 00:49:39,809
It was thoughtful of jolnir
to depart.

796
00:49:39,811 --> 00:49:42,311
This mountain now yields
before my magic.

797
00:49:42,313 --> 00:49:45,014
Loki and ymir,
stand down or perish!

798
00:49:45,016 --> 00:49:49,185
Hear me out.
I have a proposition.

799
00:49:49,187 --> 00:49:53,255
Come with me to midgard,
help me claim jolnir's powers,

800
00:49:53,257 --> 00:49:57,693
and I will reward you in ways
your former master never did.

801
00:49:57,695 --> 00:50:01,464
You'll find no evil minions
here, fiend.

802
00:50:01,466 --> 00:50:05,267
The emerald guard
will never conspire with you.

803
00:50:05,269 --> 00:50:09,105
Oh, very well.
If you insist,
we can just do it the easy way.

804
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:26,422
See? Now we're all friends.

805
00:50:27,558 --> 00:50:30,526
No sign of Santa's cottage
on my end.

806
00:50:30,528 --> 00:50:32,661
No activity
on the thermal sensors.

807
00:50:32,663 --> 00:50:35,364
N-n-nothing here either.

808
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:37,366
You still cold, kid?

809
00:50:37,368 --> 00:50:39,568
Of course.
He's cold-blooded.

810
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:42,538
N-n-no.
I'm fine.

811
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:44,807
Okay. Let's land,
get more layers on humberto,

812
00:50:44,809 --> 00:50:46,575
and search the forested areas
on foot.

813
00:50:46,577 --> 00:50:50,046
We're gonna need more bodies.
I'll signal Thor and hulk.

814
00:50:51,649 --> 00:50:56,519
I suspect Santa claus
would smile more
and shriek less, Nick.

815
00:51:01,225 --> 00:51:02,725
Ah. Better.

816
00:51:02,727 --> 00:51:05,161
Now, aim true, hulk.

817
00:51:05,163 --> 00:51:08,397
Let's deliver some gifts.

818
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:12,134
Toys away!

819
00:51:23,448 --> 00:51:26,415
Ho ho ho! Whoo!

820
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:28,684
Perhaps with less force.

821
00:51:28,686 --> 00:51:31,921
Sorry. I'll turn down
the heat for ya.

822
00:51:31,923 --> 00:51:34,924
So I'm the only one
who finds it convenient

823
00:51:34,926 --> 00:51:37,760
that Santa's house vanished
right when we found it?

824
00:51:37,762 --> 00:51:40,930
This is a prank,
and those elf-alikes
are in on it.

825
00:51:40,932 --> 00:51:43,265
Maybe. But we can't
take that chance.

826
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:46,368
If Santa is out here,
we need to find him
before loki does.

827
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:49,438
Wait up! Moving is tricky
in all these clothes.

828
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,774
But I got it.
I got it. Whoa!

829
00:51:51,776 --> 00:51:54,777
Lost it!
Got it again.

830
00:51:54,779 --> 00:51:56,612
Hello?
Is anybody out there?

831
00:51:56,614 --> 00:51:58,948
Unless he doesn't
wanna be found.

832
00:51:58,950 --> 00:52:01,117
If Santa's the powerhouse
they say he is,

833
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:04,220
he could be walking in this
winter wonderland with us,
and we'd never know.

834
00:52:04,222 --> 00:52:06,422
Another reason why
this is pointless,

835
00:52:06,424 --> 00:52:08,257
not that we needed
another reason.

836
00:52:08,259 --> 00:52:10,459
Do you have some place
you'd rather be tonight?

837
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:12,294
Yes! Don't you?

838
00:52:12,296 --> 00:52:15,764
Hey, simmer down, fellas.
Landing on the naughty list
won't fix this.

839
00:52:15,766 --> 00:52:18,934
There is no naughty list,
because there is no Santa.

840
00:52:18,936 --> 00:52:24,306
Uh, guys, maybe it's just
that my eyeballs are frozen,
but look.

841
00:52:24,308 --> 00:52:28,644
Is that Santa's house?
Santa's nice, cozy, warm house?

842
00:52:28,646 --> 00:52:32,515
Santa? Santa claus?
You in here?

843
00:52:32,517 --> 00:52:34,850
Empty.
But he's gotta be close.

844
00:52:34,852 --> 00:52:36,652
Let's fan out.
Two-mile perimeter.

845
00:52:36,654 --> 00:52:38,487
Maintain constant contact
with--
oh, heat.

846
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:39,788
Heat, heat, heat, heat.

847
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:43,626
Ohh, heat.

848
00:52:43,628 --> 00:52:46,128
Oh, yeah.
That's the stuff.

849
00:52:51,035 --> 00:52:55,271
On second thought,
i could use a moment
to warm up.

850
00:52:55,273 --> 00:52:59,008
Reptil, make room.
Really?

851
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:02,344
Getting awfully close
to those asteroids.

852
00:53:02,346 --> 00:53:05,147
Thank you so much
for letting me fly
your ship.

853
00:53:05,149 --> 00:53:08,050
It's always been
a little dream of mine.

854
00:53:08,052 --> 00:53:11,153
Oh...
It's my pleasure.

855
00:53:11,155 --> 00:53:14,623
But we need to steer
away from those asteroids.

856
00:53:14,625 --> 00:53:16,792
Aw, looks like fun.

857
00:53:16,794 --> 00:53:18,861
Let's live a little.

858
00:53:20,031 --> 00:53:22,031
I'd actually rather live a lot,

859
00:53:22,033 --> 00:53:24,700
which is why I don't want
to squeeze through that gap!

860
00:53:24,702 --> 00:53:27,336
So Santa was expecting
your visit?

861
00:53:27,338 --> 00:53:30,372
Uh, no.
It was last minute.
A business opportunity--

862
00:53:30,374 --> 00:53:31,874
look out!
Popped up.

863
00:53:31,876 --> 00:53:33,409
Lots of money--
pull up!

864
00:53:33,411 --> 00:53:35,878
To be made.

865
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:38,981
And you want to make
a lot of money?

866
00:53:38,983 --> 00:53:40,983
Absolutely.
Watch it!

867
00:53:40,985 --> 00:53:43,552
That's our ticket to
a new ship.

868
00:53:43,554 --> 00:53:45,854
What's wrong
with this ship?

869
00:53:45,856 --> 00:53:47,890
Seems like it runs
just fine.

870
00:53:47,892 --> 00:53:50,326
Thanks to me.

871
00:53:50,328 --> 00:53:52,027
And I'd like
to keep it that way.

872
00:53:52,029 --> 00:53:54,063
No! We're not gonna make it!

873
00:54:03,674 --> 00:54:05,908
You worry too much.

874
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:07,743
Santa was the same way

875
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:11,580
until he made giving gifts
to children his life's work.

876
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:14,917
Uh... come again?

877
00:54:14,919 --> 00:54:18,554
He spends all year
preparing for tonight.

878
00:54:18,556 --> 00:54:22,958
Every child-- who they are,
where they are, what they want.

879
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:26,128
All those gifts.
And then-- boom,

880
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:31,166
he delivers
every single present himself
in one night.

881
00:54:32,036 --> 00:54:35,204
Santa does this.
Santa claus.

882
00:54:35,206 --> 00:54:36,905
Of course. Who else?

883
00:54:36,907 --> 00:54:39,875
Now, I tell him,
spread it out

884
00:54:39,877 --> 00:54:43,279
over a few weeks or months,
and he refuses.

885
00:54:43,281 --> 00:54:44,713
You know why?

886
00:54:44,715 --> 00:54:48,384
Because he doesn't want to make
even one child wait.

887
00:54:48,386 --> 00:54:51,720
And he gets nothing in return.

888
00:54:51,722 --> 00:54:54,089
That's not how he sees it.

889
00:54:54,091 --> 00:54:58,560
He says the joy of giving
is the greatest gift of all.

890
00:54:58,562 --> 00:55:01,697
And that's why I love him.

891
00:55:05,403 --> 00:55:07,503
I am groot.

892
00:55:07,505 --> 00:55:09,405
You're right, pal.

893
00:55:09,407 --> 00:55:11,840
It looks like we do have
this one all wrong.

894
00:55:15,946 --> 00:55:18,881
Unbelievable!

895
00:55:20,017 --> 00:55:23,952
Mm. Best hot chocolate ever.

896
00:55:23,954 --> 00:55:27,489
This is exactly how
Santa's hot chocolate
should taste.

897
00:55:27,491 --> 00:55:29,491
All part of the charade.

898
00:55:29,493 --> 00:55:32,161
What are you looking for
over there?
Cameras.

899
00:55:32,163 --> 00:55:34,363
We're probably being filmed
for some prank show.

900
00:55:34,365 --> 00:55:36,832
<i> Holly jolly follies, </i>
or something like that.

901
00:55:36,834 --> 00:55:39,968
Ugh! Why are you so down
on Santa claus?

902
00:55:39,970 --> 00:55:44,039
A better question is,
why aren't you more
down on him, kid?

903
00:55:45,142 --> 00:55:48,777
Memories.
Some of the best I have.

904
00:55:48,779 --> 00:55:51,113
<i> My parents</i>
<i> were paleontologists.</i>

905
00:55:51,115 --> 00:55:55,117
<i> Spent a lot of time on digs,</i>
<i> living in tents.</i>

906
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:58,520
<i> Space was tight,</i>
<i> so toys were a luxury.</i>

907
00:56:01,058 --> 00:56:03,325
<i> One year, I lost my favorite.</i>

908
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:05,861
<i> I was scared</i>
<i> to tell my parents,</i>
<i> so I wrote to Santa,</i>

909
00:56:05,863 --> 00:56:08,630
<i> asking for a new one.</i>

910
00:56:08,632 --> 00:56:11,967
<i> That morning, I wake up,</i>

911
00:56:11,969 --> 00:56:13,969
<i> our tent's a jungle,</i>

912
00:56:13,971 --> 00:56:17,206
<i> and there's</i>
<i> toy dinos everywhere.</i>

913
00:56:17,208 --> 00:56:20,209
We spent all day in there,
just playing.

914
00:56:20,211 --> 00:56:23,579
I still have every one
of those dinosaurs.

915
00:56:23,581 --> 00:56:25,881
Little me
was obsessed with planes.

916
00:56:25,883 --> 00:56:28,217
I'd never been in one,
but I loved them.

917
00:56:28,219 --> 00:56:32,187
One year I asked Santa
for a top-of-the-line
f-15 model kit.

918
00:56:32,189 --> 00:56:34,189
<i> But I didn't get it.</i>

919
00:56:34,191 --> 00:56:37,059
<i> Instead, I got tickets</i>
<i> to an air show,</i>

920
00:56:37,061 --> 00:56:41,663
where I got to sit
in the cockpit
of a real f-15.

921
00:56:41,665 --> 00:56:45,234
That's when I knew
I'd be a pilot.

922
00:56:45,236 --> 00:56:47,903
I was a big fan
of baseball as a kid.

923
00:56:47,905 --> 00:56:52,107
But I wasn't athletic,
so I was never picked
for a team by the other kids.

924
00:56:52,109 --> 00:56:56,678
<i> When I wrote to Santa,</i>
<i> I didn't ask for toys.</i>

925
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,580
<i> I asked for a chance to play.</i>

926
00:56:58,582 --> 00:57:00,916
<i> I got a brand-new bat</i>
<i> and ball that year--</i>

927
00:57:00,918 --> 00:57:03,252
<i> items my family</i>
<i> couldn't afford.</i>

928
00:57:03,254 --> 00:57:05,988
And they were my ticket
into the game.

929
00:57:07,291 --> 00:57:09,291
I was awful.

930
00:57:09,293 --> 00:57:12,194
I couldn't throw,
catch, or hit.

931
00:57:12,196 --> 00:57:15,264
And I loved
every second of it.

932
00:57:15,266 --> 00:57:17,800
Okay. I'll play
your little reindeer game.

933
00:57:17,802 --> 00:57:22,204
I was six when I told my dad
i didn't believe in Santa claus.

934
00:57:22,206 --> 00:57:24,640
<i> My dad suggested</i>
<i> I take it up with Santa.</i>

935
00:57:24,642 --> 00:57:28,877
<i> So I did.</i>
<i> I wrote to Santa and told him</i>
<i> to keep his presents.</i>

936
00:57:28,879 --> 00:57:31,747
<i> All I wanted was proof</i>
<i> that he was real.</i>

937
00:57:31,749 --> 00:57:35,250
<i> After the holidays,</i>
<i> the letter came back unopened.</i>

938
00:57:35,252 --> 00:57:37,786
<i> It was marked "undeliverable."</i>

939
00:57:37,788 --> 00:57:41,290
So, I tore it up
and threw it away.

940
00:57:41,292 --> 00:57:44,326
Because I had my proof.
There's no Santa.

941
00:57:44,328 --> 00:57:46,495
You don't need proof
to believe.

942
00:57:46,497 --> 00:57:49,598
Maybe you don't, kid.
But I'm a scientist at heart.

943
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:52,901
Always have been.
And that means
i won't believe it

944
00:57:52,903 --> 00:57:54,636
until I see it.

945
00:57:58,642 --> 00:58:00,476
Get down!

946
00:58:09,186 --> 00:58:10,519
Hm.

947
00:58:10,521 --> 00:58:12,988
I grow weary of waiting.

948
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:15,123
Where is jolnir?

949
00:58:15,125 --> 00:58:17,593
Where is your Santa claus?

950
00:58:17,595 --> 00:58:20,095
Do you really think
we'll tell you, loki?

951
00:58:20,097 --> 00:58:24,066
That really would be ideal.

952
00:58:40,684 --> 00:58:42,684
Double down on blizzard king.

953
00:58:56,467 --> 00:58:58,934
Aah!

954
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:09,378
Need a hand, cap?

955
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:11,446
Or maybe a tail?

956
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:16,351
You're catching on, humberto.

957
00:59:16,353 --> 00:59:18,720
I've always learned fast.

958
00:59:18,722 --> 00:59:21,290
In third grade, I...

959
00:59:29,934 --> 00:59:32,034
Ymir, freeze them slowly.

960
00:59:32,036 --> 00:59:36,405
Perhaps they'll talk
before the cold
steals their breath.

961
00:59:36,407 --> 00:59:37,739
Indeed.

962
00:59:37,741 --> 00:59:42,144
Ice is the bringer
of truth.

963
00:59:45,249 --> 00:59:47,215
What treachery is this?

964
00:59:47,217 --> 00:59:48,116
Aah!

965
00:59:52,923 --> 00:59:54,690
Presents?

966
00:59:54,692 --> 00:59:56,658
Aaahh!

967
01:00:06,403 --> 01:00:09,104
Your aim is much
improved, hulk.

968
01:00:09,106 --> 01:00:10,572
Call me Santa hulk.

969
01:00:10,574 --> 01:00:13,809
Now, this is a worthy
holiday tradition--

970
01:00:13,811 --> 01:00:15,377
glorious battle.

971
01:00:15,379 --> 01:00:17,813
Glad you could join us.
Wait.

972
01:00:17,815 --> 01:00:20,616
Is that-- did you find--

973
01:00:20,618 --> 01:00:22,618
Santa claus? Nay.

974
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:24,453
This is our friend Nick.

975
01:00:24,455 --> 01:00:26,388
He is a most convincing
doppelgãnger.

976
01:00:26,390 --> 01:00:28,390
And he's as close
as we're gonna get.

977
01:00:28,392 --> 01:00:31,893
Oh, I hope not,
for the sake of the boy.

978
01:00:31,895 --> 01:00:34,262
Deliver Santa to me,

979
01:00:34,264 --> 01:00:37,065
or I deliver your young friend
to his doom.

980
01:00:37,067 --> 01:00:38,600
You won't do it, loki.

981
01:00:38,602 --> 01:00:42,170
Wrong! I will do whatever
it takes to prevail.

982
01:00:42,172 --> 01:00:46,308
That is what gives me
the advantage
over you... heroes.

983
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:48,176
End this madness, brother.

984
01:00:48,178 --> 01:00:50,812
I'm about to, brother.

985
01:00:50,814 --> 01:00:52,781
Reptil, down!

986
01:01:00,090 --> 01:01:02,024
Hm.

987
01:01:03,527 --> 01:01:07,095
Last chance.
Find Santa claus.

988
01:01:07,097 --> 01:01:09,631
Ho ho ho!

989
01:01:09,633 --> 01:01:13,268
No need to look
for that which is found.

990
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:15,037
It's him.

991
01:01:15,039 --> 01:01:17,706
It's really him!
It's him!
It's Santa claus!

992
01:01:17,708 --> 01:01:19,975
Deck... the... halls.

993
01:01:19,977 --> 01:01:21,443
Santa, look out!

994
01:01:25,149 --> 01:01:26,782
Ho ho ho!

995
01:01:28,185 --> 01:01:31,853
You can control space-time.

996
01:01:31,855 --> 01:01:34,723
And you can be nice, loki,

997
01:01:34,725 --> 01:01:37,025
but you choose to be naughty.

998
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:39,361
Will you change your ways?

999
01:01:39,363 --> 01:01:44,266
Oh, I will change,
with your help.

1000
01:01:47,538 --> 01:01:50,372
Oh! Oh!

1001
01:01:56,814 --> 01:01:58,146
No!

1002
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:04,686
Got your back, Santa!

1003
01:02:04,688 --> 01:02:05,654
No, reptil!

1004
01:02:08,425 --> 01:02:10,892
A touching display,
dino-child,

1005
01:02:10,894 --> 01:02:14,429
but the casket was too quick,
and you too late.

1006
01:02:14,431 --> 01:02:17,599
Come on, Santa.
Say it with me.

1007
01:02:17,601 --> 01:02:19,234
"Ho ho ho."

1008
01:02:19,236 --> 01:02:21,536
The power of Santa claus!

1009
01:02:21,538 --> 01:02:24,840
All mine!

1010
01:02:27,277 --> 01:02:32,347
You mortal insects,
time is about to pass you by.

1011
01:02:56,106 --> 01:03:00,075
Oh, so much power.

1012
01:03:00,077 --> 01:03:02,110
The perfect present.

1013
01:03:02,112 --> 01:03:04,412
Hope you kept the receipt,

1014
01:03:04,414 --> 01:03:06,748
'cause you're returning
that gift.

1015
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:10,085
Or exchanging it,
depending on store policy.

1016
01:03:10,087 --> 01:03:13,622
Your might can overcome
many things, my friends,

1017
01:03:13,624 --> 01:03:17,793
but I fear a rift in
the very fabric of existence

1018
01:03:17,795 --> 01:03:19,895
is not one of them.

1019
01:03:22,966 --> 01:03:25,901
Santa, you gotta wake up.

1020
01:03:25,903 --> 01:03:27,569
We need you.

1021
01:03:27,571 --> 01:03:30,972
I always believed in you.
I'm not gonna stop now.

1022
01:03:34,478 --> 01:03:36,678
Farewell, heroes.

1023
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:39,648
Take comfort in knowing
loki's earth

1024
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:42,684
would not be to your liking.

1025
01:03:42,686 --> 01:03:45,320
Earth isn't yours
just yet, loki.

1026
01:03:45,322 --> 01:03:48,523
I'll admit
you have spirit, Santa.

1027
01:03:48,525 --> 01:03:53,662
But spirit is no more useful
than your hat.

1028
01:03:53,664 --> 01:03:55,297
What? How?

1029
01:03:55,299 --> 01:03:58,967
If there's belief,
there's Santa claus.

1030
01:03:58,969 --> 01:04:00,769
Thanks for filling in, Nick.

1031
01:04:00,771 --> 01:04:04,773
Whew. Did my best.
I'm no you, Santa.

1032
01:04:04,775 --> 01:04:08,844
You could've fooled me, Nick.
It's like looking in a mirror.

1033
01:04:10,814 --> 01:04:16,484
I have your immense power,
and you can barely stand.

1034
01:04:16,486 --> 01:04:19,287
You're no match for me.

1035
01:04:19,289 --> 01:04:21,289
He is with our help.

1036
01:04:21,291 --> 01:04:24,226
And, like me,
you owe Santa an apology.

1037
01:04:32,736 --> 01:04:36,404
I should be at home right now!

1038
01:04:53,690 --> 01:04:56,291
Don't let up.
He's too dangerous.

1039
01:05:08,839 --> 01:05:10,338
Put the bow on him, kid.

1040
01:05:13,510 --> 01:05:16,344
Here's a couple presents
just for you, loki.

1041
01:05:31,228 --> 01:05:35,430
Your minds are once again free
from loki's tyranny,
elves of alfheim.

1042
01:05:35,432 --> 01:05:38,767
And that is what
the holidays are all about.

1043
01:05:38,769 --> 01:05:40,769
I got a confession
to make.

1044
01:05:40,771 --> 01:05:44,773
I pushed for you
to come along
to mess with cap.

1045
01:05:44,775 --> 01:05:46,274
I know.

1046
01:05:46,276 --> 01:05:49,577
But I still wanted to prove
i deserve to be
on this team someday.

1047
01:05:49,579 --> 01:05:52,914
And you did.
I was wrong.
You were right.

1048
01:05:52,916 --> 01:05:56,718
You weren't a trainee today.
You were one of us-- a hero.

1049
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:59,821
You did good, humberto.

1050
01:06:01,258 --> 01:06:03,291
Ow.

1051
01:06:03,293 --> 01:06:06,895
The emerald guard
now controls you, loki.

1052
01:06:13,103 --> 01:06:17,305
Anyway, it's a true honor
to finally meet you,

1053
01:06:17,307 --> 01:06:19,107
Santa-- sir!

1054
01:06:19,109 --> 01:06:22,911
Did I say that already?
The honor is mine,
humberto.

1055
01:06:25,649 --> 01:06:28,450
Are you okay,
Mr. claus?

1056
01:06:28,452 --> 01:06:30,585
It's "Santa," Steve.

1057
01:06:30,587 --> 01:06:32,921
Feeling stronger
by the second.

1058
01:06:32,923 --> 01:06:36,324
I'm a bit behind schedule,
but I'll make do.

1059
01:06:36,326 --> 01:06:38,026
I always have.

1060
01:06:38,028 --> 01:06:40,829
And you will tonight,
because we're gonna help.

1061
01:06:40,831 --> 01:06:42,897
It's the least we can do.

1062
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:46,101
It's the least I can do

1063
01:06:46,103 --> 01:06:48,003
for doubting you.

1064
01:06:48,005 --> 01:06:51,539
Oh, don't be too hard
on yourself, Tony.

1065
01:06:51,541 --> 01:06:54,175
Even your brain
can't be right all the time.

1066
01:06:54,177 --> 01:06:56,978
So we can help?
'Cause I've been practicing.

1067
01:06:56,980 --> 01:07:00,682
Why not?
The more, the merrier.

1068
01:07:00,684 --> 01:07:02,350
Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho!

1069
01:07:04,721 --> 01:07:07,222
Warm-blooded wretches!

1070
01:07:07,224 --> 01:07:11,092
Ice conquers all!

1071
01:07:17,401 --> 01:07:18,533
Whoa!

1072
01:07:21,338 --> 01:07:22,971
Ha...

1073
01:07:28,812 --> 01:07:31,146
Aahh!

1074
01:07:44,528 --> 01:07:46,861
Hi, honey!

1075
01:07:46,863 --> 01:07:50,098
And there's the missus.
Hello, dear!

1076
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:51,833
See, rocket?

1077
01:07:51,835 --> 01:07:55,236
You saved everyone
from that awful ice giant.

1078
01:07:55,238 --> 01:07:57,739
Isn't giving wonderful?

1079
01:07:57,741 --> 01:08:00,275
Yeah. Feels pretty good.

1080
01:08:00,277 --> 01:08:04,579
It would feel a lot better
in a new ship, though.

1081
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:09,651
Shall we? Wait.
How do I look?

1082
01:08:13,256 --> 01:08:16,124
Not bad, Nick.

1083
01:08:16,126 --> 01:08:18,126
Ow!
Not bad at all.

1084
01:08:18,128 --> 01:08:21,463
Ho ho ho ho
ho ho ho ho!

1085
01:08:21,465 --> 01:08:23,598
Is this sleigh new, Santa?

1086
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:26,634
Yes. My gift to me.

1087
01:08:26,636 --> 01:08:28,436
You okay, Nick?

1088
01:08:28,438 --> 01:08:30,105
Mm...

1089
01:08:31,475 --> 01:08:33,408
I'm giving him a new car.

1090
01:09:15,519 --> 01:09:18,419
Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho!

1091
01:09:18,421 --> 01:09:21,723
One last delivery.
Heroes get presents
tonight too.

1092
01:09:24,594 --> 01:09:27,929
Reptil, thank you
for saving me,

1093
01:09:27,931 --> 01:09:31,666
for believing in me,
for being my friend.

1094
01:09:31,668 --> 01:09:36,171
Ooh. Ooh.

1095
01:09:38,308 --> 01:09:40,942
It's so...

1096
01:09:40,944 --> 01:09:42,677
It's-- it's--

1097
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:46,114
it's really right here--
new ship...

1098
01:09:46,116 --> 01:09:48,883
It's so beautiful!

1099
01:09:50,954 --> 01:09:53,721
I am groot.

1100
01:09:53,723 --> 01:09:55,623
You're both welcome.

1101
01:09:55,625 --> 01:09:58,026
Now, let's take it
for a spin.

1102
01:09:59,829 --> 01:10:02,697
Rebuild Santa's cottage!

1103
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:05,466
He has his power back.
Why can't he do it?

1104
01:10:05,468 --> 01:10:08,970
Finish it,
or we finish you,
villain.

1105
01:10:14,044 --> 01:10:17,212
So, what did Santa give you?

1106
01:10:17,214 --> 01:10:19,347
I don't believe it.

1107
01:10:19,349 --> 01:10:21,482
It's the letter.
My letter.

1108
01:10:21,484 --> 01:10:23,484
The one I wrote to Santa
as a kid.

1109
01:10:23,486 --> 01:10:25,553
But I tore it up.
It's impossible.

1110
01:10:25,555 --> 01:10:30,058
Nothing's impossible
if you believe.

1111
01:10:40,737 --> 01:10:44,572
You have all given me
something to believe in.

1112
01:10:44,574 --> 01:10:46,374
I am groot.

1113
01:10:46,376 --> 01:10:49,577
That's kind, groot,
but we don't need

1114
01:10:49,579 --> 01:10:51,613
any more presents.

1115
01:10:59,522 --> 01:11:01,756
Wow!
Yeah.

1116
01:11:01,758 --> 01:11:04,259
Groot knows how
to finish on a high note.

1117
01:11:04,261 --> 01:11:06,628
It's just missing one thing.

1118
01:11:06,630 --> 01:11:08,196
A day off?

1119
01:11:08,198 --> 01:11:11,766
- Burritos?
- Don't say "hug."

1120
01:11:11,768 --> 01:11:13,101
Singing!

1121
01:11:16,806 --> 01:11:21,109
Ra-ah-ah-ah-ah!
