1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:00,042
23.976

2
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:55,639
{y:i}You see, after all is said and done...

3
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:59,142
{y:i}the only thing you can be really sure of...

4
00:00:59,268 --> 00:01:02,729
{y:i}the only thing
{y:i}you can really count on in this world...

5
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:06,316
{y:i}is that you just never fucking know.

6
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,319
{y:i}I bet the last thing
{y:i}you were thinking about...

7
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,488
{y:i}when you were tying your shoelaces
{y:i}this morning...

8
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:12,698
{y:i}was that there was a chance...

9
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:15,576
{y:i}that by the end of the day, this day...

10
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:18,829
{y:i}those same shoelaces
{y:i}were going to be untied...

11
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,456
{y:i}by somebody working
{y:i}for the coroner's office.

12
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:23,625
Am I right?

13
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,836
I'm right, right?

14
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,424
Hey! Get the fuck out of here!

15
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:33,969
What, you wanna know about this?
Get out of here!

16
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,971
Take that shit to the dry cleaners.

17
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:37,556
Now!

18
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,521
Sorry. Long day. Where was I?

19
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:49,943
You know, the human body is,
like, 80% moisture, right?

20
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:53,822
How much do you weigh? 165? 170?

21
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:59,536
Now, I figure
if you could somehow extract 80% of that...

22
00:02:00,204 --> 00:02:02,831
you'd have, give me a second...

23
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,876
thirty-four pounds...

24
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,420
of, like, solid...

25
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:10,797
not meat...

26
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:14,301
It'd be more like beef jerky, you know?

27
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:17,846
But with hair and bones and teeth...

28
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:20,516
shriveled-up tattoos and whatnot.

29
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,602
Probably be like this big.

30
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:27,981
In any event,
you're starting to follow my drift here, "papi"?

31
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:31,485
Because somebody has some money
that belongs to Louis.

32
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:35,030
Is it you, perchance?

33
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:39,034
Is it you that has some money
that belongs to Louis?

34
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:40,369
No.

35
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:44,289
- No? Sure?
- Yeah.

36
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,252
I'm gonna start this thing and leave.

37
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:53,674
What do you think?
Permanent press or delicate?

38
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:01,306
Wouldn't be appropriate if I asked you
if you had change for a dollar.

39
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,267
I got it.

40
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,310
Calm down. I just need four quarters.

41
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:07,855
No. I got Louis' money.

42
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,609
You got it.

43
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:14,027
Yeah, I do.

44
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,656
I got some of it, anyways.

45
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:25,539
No, this isn't what we talked about.
Now, this is... It was fucking simple.

46
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,457
- You been breaking the contract.
- Right.

47
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,293
It's simple. I give you, you give me.

48
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,503
You don't give me. It's a breach of contract.

49
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:34,631
You're fucking up.
What do you think I'm out here for?

50
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:37,301
I'm asking you a question.
What do you think I'm here for?

51
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:40,387
- Louis, I'm scared now.
- You're scared now? I don't give a fuck.

52
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,848
I told you not to let this get out of control.

53
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,309
What'd I tell you? I told you that, right?

54
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,477
Listen, here's what you're gonna do for me:

55
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,148
You're gonna come see me tomorrow
and you're going to bring me something.

56
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:52,566
Okay, you hear me?

57
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,902
- Yes, I do.
- Something to scale, all right?

58
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:58,113
Otherwise I can't talk to you no more.
All right?

59
00:03:58,197 --> 00:04:01,825
I'm gonna have to send Gigli over.
He's gonna have to settle up with you.

60
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:04,411
You come to me tomorrow
or he goes to you. Very simple.

61
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,622
- I'll be here tomorrow.
- That's good.

62
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:08,790
- I'm not kidding.
- Get the fuck out of here.

63
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:11,418
- Okay.
- Get the fuck... Go, you fucking...

64
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:12,503
Fucking roach.

65
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:15,130
Fucking class of people.

66
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:18,509
- I'm in Siberia around here.
- I know.

67
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,762
Fuck this city.
I don't know how you guys cut it out here.

68
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:24,056
It's Gigli, by the way.

69
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:26,183
- What?
- My name is...

70
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:28,852
pronounced Gigli. It rhymes with really.

71
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:31,146
- Is that right? Is that so?
- Yeah.

72
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,941
All right.
I'll remember that for the next time, then.

73
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:37,486
Meanwhile, you got something
for me, Gigli? Rhymes with really.

74
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:39,988
It's about half.

75
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,492
- Half?
- Half for today.

76
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:47,412
Believe me, that's all the guy had.
It's better than nothing.

77
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,958
How about it's not better than nothing,
you fucking idiot?

78
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:54,086
Better is fuck the money
then you hurt him as to spread the word.

79
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:56,755
Since when are you authorized
to make policy decisions?

80
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:59,132
I'm sorry, Louis. I didn't know.

81
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,552
Are you all they got to offer around here?

82
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:05,222
You're supposed to be
this vicious, fucking mad dog.

83
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:07,516
I'm sorry.

84
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:14,106
Walk with me.

85
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:18,652
There is a certain individual...

86
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:23,240
who is creating very substantial difficulties
for a dear friend of mine in New York.

87
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,534
Now, this certain party...

88
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:28,412
is very bullheaded
and seems to be removed...

89
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:31,373
from what I would like to call
my sphere of influence.

90
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:34,751
- All right, how can I help?
- The plot needs a twist.

91
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:38,630
The individual needs to be touched
in some manner as to...

92
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:42,551
convince him of the error of his ways
before he can hurt other people...

93
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:45,929
- particularly my friend from New York.
- Right.

94
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:50,017
Now, this certain individual, he's got...

95
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:54,521
a beloved relative
with certain psychological defects.

96
00:05:57,566 --> 00:06:00,027
I want the relative gotten, all right?

97
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,155
And I want him, for the time being,
held on to.

98
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:07,701
Perhaps then reason can prevail.

99
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:11,747
- You're following all this?
- Yeah, all of it.

100
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,209
Got it.

101
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:45,906
All right. Wait.

102
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:48,951
- Where is he?
- Over there.

103
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:51,036
Right there? That's him?

104
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,664
All right. Thanks.

105
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:57,918
I'm all right. You can go outside.
I'm okay. Thanks.

106
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:24,945
Are you Brian?

107
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:33,328
I know you're Brian.
Your friend ratted you out back there.

108
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:34,997
Hello?

109
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:41,795
What are you eating there?
What do you got?

110
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:45,215
- What are those, polly seeds?
- They're not. You're stupid.

111
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:47,634
I'm stupid.

112
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:51,763
- They look like polly seeds to me.
- They're sunflower seeds.

113
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:53,223
That's the same thing.

114
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:55,434
We called them polly seeds
when I was a kid.

115
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:58,520
You must be the stupidest person,
you piss-head, pisser-fucker.

116
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:08,363
Me and you, we're supposed
to go for a quick walk. You ready?

117
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:11,116
We'll take a walk around the block.
What do you say?

118
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:13,076
I won't give anybody my seeds.

119
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:15,454
Barry always asks
why I don't give anybody any.

120
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:19,374
Don't worry about it. Keep those.
That's for you, okay?

121
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,668
Let's go. We're gonna take a walk. Come on.

122
00:08:22,044 --> 00:08:23,337
What did that?

123
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:25,964
He's kidding.

124
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:37,518
Sorry about that. All right, look...

125
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:39,561
it's real simple.

126
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:42,147
You and I are gonna go outside
and take a little walk.

127
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:43,815
I won't grab you again, okay?

128
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:47,653
I have to go to the Baywatch.

129
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:49,279
I'm sorry, what?

130
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:51,782
I have to go to the Baywatch.
I was gonna go.

131
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:54,243
You wanna watch "Baywatch"?

132
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:56,286
Roll by my apartment,
we'll turn on "Baywatch".

133
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:59,164
You're the stupidest person.

134
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:01,625
Not television. The Baywatch.

135
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,878
The Baywatch?

136
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:07,005
- Yeah, the Baywatch.
- Okay.

137
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,468
Can I go?

138
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:19,059
- You wanna go now?
- To the Baywatch.

139
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:23,856
Yeah. I'm going there. I was on my way.

140
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:29,403
- Yes, I would.
- All right.

141
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:31,321
Let's go.

142
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,577
Come on, let's go.

143
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:39,663
Okay, I gotta get my radio.

144
00:09:39,705 --> 00:09:41,874
- The music's gonna be good there.
- Okay, good.

145
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:48,130
Baywatch!

146
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:50,674
Here we come.

147
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:53,844
Wait a minute.
You hear that, now? What is that?

148
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:56,305
- You hear that?
- No.

149
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:59,725
Yep, it's my walkie-talkie calling.

150
00:10:00,893 --> 00:10:01,894
Yeah, hello?

151
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:05,814
I told you, don't ever bother me again
when I'm taking trips with my friends.

152
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:10,277
What? No, we're going to the Baywatch.

153
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,696
Yep, that's right, the Baywatch.

154
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:17,034
No. Holy mackerel.

155
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:20,704
Would you know
when they'll be open again?

156
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:24,625
We'll call you tomorrow for the update.

157
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:29,588
How do you like that?
Baywatch is closed today.

158
00:10:31,215 --> 00:10:33,842
- No.
- Tomorrow we'll go.

159
00:10:33,926 --> 00:10:35,219
I can't believe it.

160
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:39,056
This always happens like that, right?
When you plan a big trip.

161
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,231
Hello there. P.O.B.

162
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,233
What does that mean?

163
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:51,068
P.O.B. Limo drivers say that.

164
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:52,611
That's good. What does it mean?

165
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:54,988
P.O.B. Passenger On Board.

166
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:57,407
- Already?
{y:i}- Yeah, already.

167
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:59,535
That's good.
You headed back to your place?

168
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:01,578
- I am.
{y:i}- Good.

169
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,122
{y:i}- We'll talk later.
- Yeah, we'll talk later.

170
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:17,761
Come on in. It's all right. I don't bite.

171
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:26,770
You hungry? I got food.

172
00:11:28,564 --> 00:11:29,982
You thirsty?

173
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:32,276
I want a soda.

174
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:35,612
You want a soda? I'm out of soda.
Want a water?

175
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:38,198
You want a water? I'll get you a water.

176
00:11:44,246 --> 00:11:46,456
All right. How is that? Good?

177
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:57,926
- I wanna go home.
- All right, you got to stay here for a little bit.

178
00:12:04,183 --> 00:12:05,475
No, I wanna go home.

179
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:08,395
No, we got to stay here.
Can't do it right now.

180
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,023
So maybe you wanna watch TV or cartoons?

181
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:13,525
I wanna go home.

182
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:16,945
- We got to stay here.
- No.

183
00:12:18,614 --> 00:12:20,490
Brian, what are you doing?

184
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:22,201
- Take me home now.
- Stop.

185
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:25,579
- Fuck all of you! You stupid soup-fucker!
- What?

186
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:28,832
- Don't do that, motherfucker!
- What's wrong with you? Cut that out.

187
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:33,504
- Cut it out! Stop! Be quiet!
- I'm going to the Baywatch.

188
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,053
All right.

189
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:47,100
Where are my seeds?

190
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:49,811
They're sunflower seeds, idiot.

191
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:52,189
They're right there.

192
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:56,693
- They're sunflower seeds.
- Behind you. Right there.

193
00:13:09,248 --> 00:13:10,541
Stay here.

194
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:14,086
Everything's fine. Just kidding around.

195
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,559
- Hello.
- Hi.

196
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:32,521
May I be of some assistance?

197
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,108
Well, that remains to be seen.

198
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,361
Look, I'm sorry to bother you. It's just...

199
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:43,073
I was wondering if it wouldn't be
too much trouble if I could use your phone.

200
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:44,908
- That's...
- Right.

201
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:47,160
I just took a one-bedroom in the front...

202
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:50,706
and I've been waiting all day for
the phone company to come hook me up.

203
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:53,250
- You know...
- Yeah, it's just kind of a bad...

204
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:57,754
It'll only take a second, I promise.
You know, it's probably a local call.

205
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:00,716
I can't. I'm sorry.

206
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:04,052
I'll be in and out before you know it.
I promise.

207
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:07,181
Just leave a faint scent.

208
00:14:11,852 --> 00:14:13,687
Yeah, all right. Come on in.

209
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,106
- Thank you.
- Sure.

210
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:21,028
The phone's right there.

211
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:24,198
- I promise it'll only take a minute.
- All right.

212
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:40,422
Hello.

213
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:45,302
What are you doing?
Go sit down in the kitchen.

214
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:49,598
These computer answering things,
they drive me nuts.

215
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:54,353
- You're making a telephone call.
- Right, she's making a telephone call.

216
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:56,939
Don't call Baywatch
because they're closed today.

217
00:14:57,231 --> 00:14:58,899
I wouldn't think of it.

218
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:19,545
I'm sorry, I got to ask.
Do we know each other?

219
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:22,172
Not yet.

220
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:26,218
I'm Ricki.

221
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:31,557
Larry Gigli, right?

222
00:15:32,516 --> 00:15:36,061
- I saw it on the mailbox.
- Yeah, it's pronounced Gigli.

223
00:15:36,979 --> 00:15:38,438
Rhymes with really.

224
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:42,317
- It's nice to meet you, Larry Gigli.
- Nice to meet you, Larry.

225
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:45,028
What's your name?

226
00:15:47,406 --> 00:15:48,532
Bob.

227
00:15:48,574 --> 00:15:51,243
- You're stupid. That's not my name.
- That's not your name?

228
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:53,996
- What is your name, sweetie?
- That's it. His name's Bob.

229
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,331
- His name's not Bob.
- Your name is Bob.

230
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:58,542
Whatever your name is...

231
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:02,129
has anyone ever told you
you're a very handsome young man?

232
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,061
Can I talk to you for a minute?

233
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:20,898
Sure.

234
00:16:25,903 --> 00:16:27,237
In private.

235
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:35,829
I can't fucking believe this.

236
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:39,041
It's an unexpected bonus. Who'd have
thought you were a babe magnet?

237
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:42,419
- You're better than a dog.
- You're a dog, you dog-head piss-fart!

238
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:43,670
Whatever.

239
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:58,769
You know,
I heard you were a bit of a fuckup.

240
00:16:59,603 --> 00:17:03,982
But I gotta tell you, I'm frankly amazed
at how much of a fuckup you actually are.

241
00:17:05,651 --> 00:17:08,278
- Am I missing something here?
- It would seem so.

242
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,782
Why don't you call Louis
and he'll explain everything to you.

243
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:17,496
I don't know that I know any Louis.

244
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:21,875
Then I guess he hasn't called you
to tell you he doesn't trust you...

245
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:23,752
with a task of this magnitude.

246
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,964
That he feels the stakes are too high.

247
00:17:27,673 --> 00:17:29,132
- Nope.
- "Nope."

248
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,261
I guess he also probably
hasn't called to tell you...

249
00:17:32,344 --> 00:17:36,348
that he'd feel more comfortable if there were
two independent, unacquainted...

250
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:39,351
perhaps even mutually hostile
contractors working on this...

251
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:42,229
so they could keep an eye on one another.

252
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:46,024
Nope. There's no reason
for you to take my word...

253
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:48,777
for precisely
how second-rate he considers you.

254
00:17:48,986 --> 00:17:53,198
It'd probably make both our lives a lot easier
if you just heard it directly from him.

255
00:17:56,869 --> 00:17:59,413
That's good stuff. I had that today.

256
00:18:00,706 --> 00:18:02,833
- Excuse me one minute.
- Sure.

257
00:18:06,837 --> 00:18:08,005
Louis, you there?

258
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:09,798
I'm here. What do you want?

259
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:12,843
Yeah, there's this...

260
00:18:13,594 --> 00:18:15,846
young lady here trying to tell me that...

261
00:18:15,971 --> 00:18:17,556
All right, this thing is monumental.

262
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:20,934
Certainly too big for a jerk-off like yourself,
but I had no choice.

263
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:24,313
{y:i}This thing represents my ass and my future.

264
00:18:24,396 --> 00:18:28,442
I want you to work with her and I want you
to watch her as she will be watching you.

265
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:30,402
I want you to know...

266
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:33,030
that I will personally excoriate
anyone responsible...

267
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:35,282
for the tiniest fuckup in this action.

268
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:38,076
{y:i}- And I want you to understand that.
- Yes, Louis.

269
00:18:39,244 --> 00:18:40,746
"Yes, Louis"?

270
00:18:41,997 --> 00:18:44,499
Do you happen to know
what "excoriate" means?

271
00:18:45,584 --> 00:18:47,377
It's not coming to me at the moment.

272
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:50,923
It means "to strip or wear off the skin of...

273
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:52,257
"to flay."

274
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:56,845
{y:i}I'm learning a word a day. And it's critical
{y:i}to use these words in conversation...

275
00:18:56,929 --> 00:18:59,431
but that's not why I used it
in this conversation.

276
00:18:59,515 --> 00:19:02,935
{y:i}In this conversation
{y:i}I used it because I meant it.

277
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:06,063
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll be going now.

278
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:11,235
All right, I'll talk to you later.
Yeah, don't worry about it.

279
00:19:15,197 --> 00:19:17,491
Now don't get yourself all tied in a knot.

280
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:20,118
Okay? I don't know this guy,
and he doesn't know me.

281
00:19:20,202 --> 00:19:23,539
But my reputation apparently is pretty solid.

282
00:19:23,622 --> 00:19:27,000
So why don't you just get yourself straight...

283
00:19:27,084 --> 00:19:29,753
and we can put this whole thing behind us.

284
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:33,507
And if you have
any decaffeinated or herbal tea...

285
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,467
I would really be most appreciative.

286
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:37,469
- I want tea.
- Two teas.

287
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:41,306
Let me tell you something, okay?

288
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:45,435
I don't know who the fuck you think you are,
but I don't work like this.

289
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:46,770
You got that?

290
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:49,147
If you wanna talk about reputations...

291
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:53,151
and if by some fucking miracle long shot
you haven't heard of my reputation...

292
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:55,112
let me tell you who the fuck I am.

293
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:59,950
I am the fucking Sultan of Slick, Sadie.
I am the Rule of fucking Cool.

294
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:02,619
You wanna be a gangster?
You wanna be a thug?

295
00:20:02,661 --> 00:20:06,790
You sit at my fucking feet. Gather the pearls
that emanate forth from me.

296
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:11,420
Because I'm the fucking original,
straight-first-foremost, pimp-mack...

297
00:20:11,503 --> 00:20:15,090
fucking hustler,
original gangster's gangster.

298
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:22,723
I don't know what you're talking about,
but I'm gonna get my stuff.

299
00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:28,770
And don't you worry your little
gangster's gangster head about it...

300
00:20:28,854 --> 00:20:30,022
I can manage.

301
00:20:32,024 --> 00:20:35,819
How many cups of your own spit
you think you swallow every day, Larry?

302
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,532
I think about 35 cups.

303
00:20:40,908 --> 00:20:43,452
- Would you just shut the fuck up.
- You're an idiot!

304
00:20:45,871 --> 00:20:47,789
- What is it with you?
- No, you.

305
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:50,417
- What, you just go in and out?
- You're an idiot.

306
00:20:50,501 --> 00:20:54,505
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- You're the fuck, you stupid duck-fuck.

307
00:20:54,588 --> 00:20:57,466
Do me a favor
and just act fucking normal for a minute.

308
00:20:57,549 --> 00:20:59,176
- Looks like...
- Just for a minute.

309
00:20:59,218 --> 00:21:01,386
You'll end up with Elliot over there.

310
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:04,515
I know you understand
what I'm talking about. Fucking be normal.

311
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:07,684
- I'm telling you...
- Not fucking crazy! Normal!

312
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:10,062
How about if I smack you
in the fucking head?

313
00:21:11,063 --> 00:21:14,233
Leave him alone. We're supposed
to watch him, not slap him around.

314
00:21:14,316 --> 00:21:16,443
Don't tell me what we're supposed to do.

315
00:21:16,527 --> 00:21:19,029
How about this?
You leave him alone or I'll kill you.

316
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:22,157
You'll kill me? Fuck you! Go ahead.

317
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:24,493
I'll kill you.

318
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:28,413
You don't tell me what to do. Okay?

319
00:21:28,497 --> 00:21:31,917
Don't tell me what we might do.
Don't tell me what we're supposed to do.

320
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,879
Don't tell me what we maybe should do.
Don't ever tell me nothing!

321
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:41,218
I'll tell you this,
you leave him alone or I'll kill you.

322
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:47,099
I'm gonna say 35 cups.
I'm gonna say 35 cups of spit.

323
00:21:50,269 --> 00:21:52,354
I'm a genius. I'm a genius, man.

324
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:59,486
- What's he talking about?
- I don't know.

325
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:05,784
Look, why don't we try
and make this pleasant.

326
00:22:10,956 --> 00:22:12,040
Nice.

327
00:22:14,793 --> 00:22:15,836
Easy.

328
00:22:26,263 --> 00:22:28,557
So, what do you normally hire out for?

329
00:22:29,141 --> 00:22:31,268
I do jobs of various types.

330
00:22:33,312 --> 00:22:35,439
- How about yourself?
- Me, too.

331
00:22:36,148 --> 00:22:39,067
I do various types of jobs of various kinds.

332
00:22:40,569 --> 00:22:41,945
There you have it.

333
00:22:44,615 --> 00:22:46,658
How come I never seen you around before?

334
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:49,494
I'm from another place.

335
00:22:51,163 --> 00:22:52,748
Where would that be, Ricki?

336
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:56,210
Somewhere else, Larry.

337
00:22:57,169 --> 00:22:59,296
Okay. I see.

338
00:23:02,007 --> 00:23:05,928
- And my name's not really Ricki.
- And what would it be, then?

339
00:23:11,808 --> 00:23:14,645
Then how about I keep calling you Ricki
just to piss you off?

340
00:23:14,686 --> 00:23:17,439
- Lf it'll make you happy.
- Yeah, it will.

341
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:25,405
- This isn't very good food.
- Too bad. That's your dinner. Eat it.

342
00:23:26,198 --> 00:23:27,824
- I'm hungry.
- Fuck.

343
00:23:32,162 --> 00:23:34,498
- He said he's hungry.
- So? Let him eat his food.

344
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:37,167
- I don't like this food.
- Too bad! Eat your food, stupid!

345
00:23:37,251 --> 00:23:40,712
Back off! God! It's not his fault.

346
00:23:40,754 --> 00:23:43,257
Yeah, it's not my fault I'm brain-damaged.

347
00:23:45,384 --> 00:23:47,886
Beautiful. What are you, his shop steward?

348
00:23:48,136 --> 00:23:49,888
Listen, you fucking retard, eat your...

349
00:23:49,972 --> 00:23:51,557
- Enough! Easy already.
- Not enough.

350
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,559
- What is your...
- Let me tell you something.

351
00:23:53,642 --> 00:23:56,687
In every relationship
there's a bull and a cow.

352
00:23:56,770 --> 00:24:00,232
It so happens that in this relationship
right here with me and you...

353
00:24:00,274 --> 00:24:02,985
I'm the bull, you're the cow.

354
00:24:03,443 --> 00:24:06,071
All right? Bull. Cow.

355
00:24:06,989 --> 00:24:09,241
- You got that?
- Yeah, I got it. Bull, cow.

356
00:24:09,491 --> 00:24:12,619
You make him something else to eat.
Otherwise, mind your business.

357
00:24:12,703 --> 00:24:14,037
I wanna go home.

358
00:24:15,747 --> 00:24:16,832
You can't go home.

359
00:24:17,332 --> 00:24:19,501
- I wanna go home.
- You can't go home right now!

360
00:24:19,585 --> 00:24:22,254
- Eat your food!
- Piss you! I want to go home!

361
00:24:29,261 --> 00:24:32,806
How you gonna go
to the Baywatch tomorrow if you go home?

362
00:24:36,185 --> 00:24:38,645
This is your spot. Yeah?

363
00:24:39,813 --> 00:24:42,566
It's nice. Come on. Lie down.

364
00:24:48,071 --> 00:24:49,406
This is a couch.

365
00:24:49,656 --> 00:24:53,452
Don't worry about it. It's fine.
It's a good sleeping place. Lie down.

366
00:25:00,167 --> 00:25:01,627
Larry, read to me.

367
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,756
- What?
- Read to me, Larry.

368
00:25:06,632 --> 00:25:08,342
Read to him, Larry.

369
00:25:08,967 --> 00:25:12,095
I don't wanna read to him.
What do I got to read to him for?

370
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:13,430
Read to me, Larry.

371
00:25:13,514 --> 00:25:15,933
- What for?
- It soothes me down.

372
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:20,562
- It soothes you down?
- Come on, Larry, read to him.

373
00:25:20,687 --> 00:25:24,441
- What am I gonna read? I got nothing here.
- Read him a book.

374
00:25:32,074 --> 00:25:33,659
You don't have a book?

375
00:25:36,495 --> 00:25:39,331
- I got a phone book.
- There you go.

376
00:25:40,207 --> 00:25:43,168
- Read to me, Larry.
- All right, fine.

377
00:25:50,467 --> 00:25:51,510
Here you go.

378
00:25:51,593 --> 00:25:53,804
"Since 1868.

379
00:25:55,222 --> 00:25:58,892
"For well over a century,
the adventurous flavor of Tabasco sauce...

380
00:25:58,976 --> 00:26:01,687
"has fired up generations of thrill-seekers."

381
00:26:02,187 --> 00:26:04,273
- Okay?
- That was good.

382
00:26:05,315 --> 00:26:06,650
Read to me more.

383
00:26:11,864 --> 00:26:16,493
"Lts all-natural ingredients and
unique aging process in white oak barrels...

384
00:26:16,827 --> 00:26:19,705
"keeps Tabasco
on the culinary cutting edge.

385
00:26:24,877 --> 00:26:27,671
"Try it on eggs, pizza, salads,
and any other food...

386
00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:31,341
"for a burst of flavor
that will tantalize your taste buds." That's it.

387
00:26:31,383 --> 00:26:32,634
- Read to me more.
- That's it.

388
00:26:32,718 --> 00:26:34,887
I'm not reading the ingredients. I'm done.

389
00:26:35,721 --> 00:26:38,682
- Okay, thank you, Larry.
- Sure.

390
00:26:58,911 --> 00:27:01,038
Tell you what, no offense...

391
00:27:01,246 --> 00:27:03,749
you don't look like any contractor
I ever met.

392
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:09,046
Apparently, there's a need for all types.

393
00:27:15,219 --> 00:27:16,553
So listen.

394
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,140
You know, I was thinking
about what you said before...

395
00:27:20,432 --> 00:27:23,894
about us being stuck in this situation.
There's nothing we can do.

396
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:26,897
I think you're right.
We might as well make the best of it.

397
00:27:27,648 --> 00:27:28,982
I think so.

398
00:27:29,608 --> 00:27:33,612
So, you know, look,
don't take this the wrong way, believe me.

399
00:27:34,446 --> 00:27:36,823
But I just... This is, you know...

400
00:27:37,032 --> 00:27:40,827
I hate to see you sleep on the floor like that.
I mean, come on.

401
00:27:41,036 --> 00:27:44,581
So if you want to,
you can go ahead and just, you know...

402
00:27:45,832 --> 00:27:47,292
just take half of my bed.

403
00:27:50,128 --> 00:27:52,714
'Cause we're working together.
We're grownups, right?

404
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:55,467
You know, we're partners. We'll just...

405
00:27:56,468 --> 00:27:58,262
do the whole thing professionally.

406
00:28:02,975 --> 00:28:06,937
That's very kind of you. Thank you.
I mean, I'd love to.

407
00:28:09,147 --> 00:28:11,149
You know, professionally.

408
00:28:12,109 --> 00:28:13,277
Please.

409
00:28:13,902 --> 00:28:17,072
How's that professionally? You like that?

410
00:28:18,198 --> 00:28:19,616
That's professional. Right here.

411
00:28:19,658 --> 00:28:23,120
Bull. Cow. That's how that works.

412
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:31,795
There's your bull right there!
There's your bull.

413
00:28:32,337 --> 00:28:33,839
There's the horn.

414
00:28:34,256 --> 00:28:37,217
You fuck with the bull, you get the horn.

415
00:28:43,098 --> 00:28:44,850
That's professional.

416
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,854
Fucking professional.

417
00:28:49,813 --> 00:28:51,273
Look at that.

418
00:28:52,858 --> 00:28:54,776
That's the bull. Right.

419
00:28:55,819 --> 00:28:58,447
Get the bull by the horn.
You know what I'm talking about?

420
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:01,491
I'll give you the horn. Want to see the horn?

421
00:30:07,432 --> 00:30:08,767
You know...

422
00:30:09,101 --> 00:30:11,854
you're actually a very attractive woman.

423
00:30:14,773 --> 00:30:15,774
Thank you.

424
00:30:16,984 --> 00:30:18,527
You're welcome.

425
00:30:19,778 --> 00:30:22,406
You know, this may be a good time
to suggest...

426
00:30:22,447 --> 00:30:26,243
that you not allow the seeds of cruel hope
to sprout in your soul.

427
00:30:27,953 --> 00:30:30,914
I don't know what that means,
but it sounds beautiful.

428
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,917
It means you're not my type.

429
00:30:36,336 --> 00:30:37,838
Is that right?

430
00:30:40,174 --> 00:30:42,467
What about me is not your type?

431
00:30:47,014 --> 00:30:48,223
Your penis.

432
00:30:49,641 --> 00:30:50,934
What does that mean?

433
00:30:52,853 --> 00:30:54,479
It means I'm gay.

434
00:30:55,564 --> 00:30:57,441
It means I'm a lesbian.

435
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:03,322
But I got to tell you, if I wasn't...

436
00:31:04,489 --> 00:31:07,784
I mean, after a first date like this,
I'd find it really hard...

437
00:31:08,577 --> 00:31:12,414
not to just get under the covers
and do you bigtime right now.

438
00:31:13,624 --> 00:31:14,958
Good night.

439
00:31:19,963 --> 00:31:21,298
"Good night"?

440
00:31:36,647 --> 00:31:40,776
{y:i}Whoa, Step-papa.
{y:i}With that sassy new look...

441
00:31:40,901 --> 00:31:43,987
{y:i}sheep's all that and a bag of chips.

442
00:31:54,456 --> 00:31:57,292
{y:i}Melbourne's forecast. ;
{y:i}The chance of a brief shower tomorrow...

443
00:31:57,376 --> 00:32:01,421
{y:i}but we're expecting a mostly fine day with
{y:i}a light-to-moderate southwestwardly wind.

444
00:32:01,505 --> 00:32:03,131
Who the fuck are you talking to?

445
00:32:03,215 --> 00:32:06,176
{y:i}Sydney also fine and 18.
{y:i}Brisbane, showers...

446
00:32:06,218 --> 00:32:07,302
Give me that back, please.

447
00:32:07,386 --> 00:32:08,929
{y:i}- Sunny, 32.
- Give me that.

448
00:32:09,012 --> 00:32:12,599
{y:i}Adelaide and Hobart both
{y:i}mainly fine days tomorrow. Around our...

449
00:32:12,724 --> 00:32:14,518
You know how much this shit costs?

450
00:32:17,354 --> 00:32:20,023
- It's $5.
- No, it's not $5.

451
00:32:21,733 --> 00:32:23,694
- It's $10.
- No, it's...

452
00:32:26,572 --> 00:32:28,907
Why am I even talking to you for?

453
00:32:28,991 --> 00:32:31,285
- It's $10.
- Yeah, it's $10. All right.

454
00:32:41,587 --> 00:32:46,466
Just wanted to tell you, you know,
just get straight about that thing last night.

455
00:32:47,384 --> 00:32:49,469
You know, no hard feelings.

456
00:32:49,803 --> 00:32:52,890
You know what I mean?
I don't want you to get upset or nothing.

457
00:32:56,476 --> 00:33:00,564
That's it. Don't be coming back, though.
I mean, it's a one-time offer.

458
00:33:01,398 --> 00:33:03,400
One shot with me. I'm out.

459
00:33:07,946 --> 00:33:09,781
Are you expecting somebody?

460
00:33:14,244 --> 00:33:15,454
Come on!

461
00:33:17,122 --> 00:33:19,208
- Larry!
- Shit!

462
00:33:19,499 --> 00:33:21,543
- It's your mother.
- Fuck! It's a cop.

463
00:33:22,586 --> 00:33:23,921
Open the door!

464
00:33:24,254 --> 00:33:27,049
- I was watching that.
- Be quiet.

465
00:33:27,132 --> 00:33:29,927
Go in this room. Go. I want you to stay here.

466
00:33:29,968 --> 00:33:32,804
- Don't come out. Don't say anything.
- We're going to Baywatch?

467
00:33:32,888 --> 00:33:34,890
- Yeah. Soon. Stay here. Be quiet.
- Okay.

468
00:33:34,973 --> 00:33:37,267
- Come on, I'm dying here!
- Coming!

469
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:40,771
- Larry, I have a chicken.
- Don't say anything.

470
00:33:42,981 --> 00:33:43,941
What?

471
00:33:44,024 --> 00:33:47,486
Your door's not thick enough to pretend
you're not home when you're home.

472
00:33:47,528 --> 00:33:50,405
- What's up?
- I was in the neighborhood.

473
00:33:52,366 --> 00:33:54,952
- How are you today?
- Just fine. Yourself?

474
00:33:55,536 --> 00:33:56,662
Just fine.

475
00:33:57,996 --> 00:34:00,874
I'm searching for news on the underground.

476
00:34:03,418 --> 00:34:05,546
Might you know what it is I'm getting at?

477
00:34:06,672 --> 00:34:08,799
- No.
- No. Well...

478
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,761
This is one of those mysterious cases.

479
00:34:13,011 --> 00:34:17,307
Unsolvable. Probably turn out
to be an alien abduction, but you know...

480
00:34:17,349 --> 00:34:21,228
we're obligated to at least create
the appearance of due diligence.

481
00:34:21,436 --> 00:34:23,480
- What?
- I didn't say nothing.

482
00:34:25,524 --> 00:34:27,442
You know, your friend Louis...

483
00:34:30,529 --> 00:34:35,117
his supervisor back in the home office
is about to fold his napkin, right?

484
00:34:35,868 --> 00:34:38,370
- Sorry?
- Starkman, in New York.

485
00:34:39,162 --> 00:34:40,622
He's through.

486
00:34:40,998 --> 00:34:45,210
Looking at huge federal time.
Big, ugly, dark dungeon underground.

487
00:34:45,294 --> 00:34:48,505
No chance of parole, never ever. Time.

488
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:55,721
Yep. I'm sorry to say.

489
00:34:56,096 --> 00:34:58,891
I hear he's a good guy, but, you know...

490
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:01,685
In any event, here's my problem...

491
00:35:01,727 --> 00:35:05,480
and if you know any of this,
feel free, jump in, shut me up.

492
00:35:06,023 --> 00:35:09,193
This federal prosecutor out here...

493
00:35:09,776 --> 00:35:13,572
the one with Starkman's testicular matter
clutched in his fist...

494
00:35:13,989 --> 00:35:16,658
this very federal prosecutor's
little brother...

495
00:35:17,659 --> 00:35:19,536
Any of this sound familiar?

496
00:35:20,621 --> 00:35:21,955
To me? No.

497
00:35:22,748 --> 00:35:24,124
No. Well...

498
00:35:24,875 --> 00:35:28,712
This very federal prosecutor's little brother,
a bit dopey from what I gather...

499
00:35:28,754 --> 00:35:30,589
may have been absconded with...

500
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:35,594
which, as you can imagine,
would be to the dismay of our prosecutor.

501
00:35:39,598 --> 00:35:40,807
I think...

502
00:35:41,433 --> 00:35:45,437
But I could be wrong about this because
it's almost too stupid for a mind to grasp.

503
00:35:45,521 --> 00:35:48,524
But I think maybe someone...

504
00:35:48,941 --> 00:35:51,944
in your professional community...

505
00:35:52,069 --> 00:35:55,280
might be participating
in these shenanigans...

506
00:35:55,822 --> 00:35:57,866
to, I don't know...

507
00:35:57,950 --> 00:36:01,578
help squeeze a little friendship...

508
00:36:01,954 --> 00:36:05,123
altruism, whatever,
out of this particular federal official.

509
00:36:05,207 --> 00:36:08,001
Maybe in the hopes that Starkman...

510
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:11,880
will wake up one morning...

511
00:36:16,552 --> 00:36:20,556
And wake up one morning
to find all charges mysteriously dropped.

512
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:25,394
The school of thought of my colleagues
is that this kid is already way out of town.

513
00:36:25,477 --> 00:36:30,274
I alone am of the opposite school.
I think he's still here. That's what I think.

514
00:36:30,607 --> 00:36:33,569
But what's important is what you think.
What do you think?

515
00:36:33,652 --> 00:36:37,114
As a friend who's got his ear to the street.
Seriously.

516
00:36:39,032 --> 00:36:41,159
- I never... You know...
- I know.

517
00:36:41,827 --> 00:36:43,745
You don't know nothing.

518
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,999
I can tell just by looking at you.

519
00:36:53,755 --> 00:36:57,593
The whole thing's probably
alien abduction, like I said before.

520
00:37:02,681 --> 00:37:05,184
Man, you know what I'd love to do...

521
00:37:06,185 --> 00:37:07,519
right now?

522
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:16,653
Go down to Marie Callender's...

523
00:37:17,029 --> 00:37:20,490
get me a big bowl, pie, some ice cream on it.

524
00:37:22,034 --> 00:37:23,118
Good.

525
00:37:23,493 --> 00:37:25,454
Put some on your head...

526
00:37:25,662 --> 00:37:29,333
your tongue would slap your brains out
trying to get to it.

527
00:37:29,875 --> 00:37:31,001
Interested?

528
00:37:32,336 --> 00:37:33,420
Sure?

529
00:37:34,713 --> 00:37:37,591
Yeah, I'm trying to get in shape, you know.

530
00:37:58,904 --> 00:38:00,280
Say no more.

531
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,786
Thanks for the hospitality.

532
00:38:06,662 --> 00:38:11,083
It can't be the most pleasant thing
to have your privacy be intruded on.

533
00:38:11,291 --> 00:38:13,627
Maybe if you hear anything,
you'll let me know?

534
00:38:16,088 --> 00:38:18,549
Yeah, you know, if I hear anything.

535
00:38:24,638 --> 00:38:26,598
Yeah, I'll let you know.

536
00:38:45,951 --> 00:38:47,578
All right.

537
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:54,334
A federal fucking prosecutor!

538
00:38:55,919 --> 00:38:57,629
- Fuck!
- Larry?

539
00:38:58,297 --> 00:39:01,633
- I'll come back now, okay?
- What are you doing? I told you to...

540
00:39:02,176 --> 00:39:05,137
- I'm hungry.
- We got nothing to eat.

541
00:39:05,512 --> 00:39:08,974
- I'm hungry, though.
- A federal fucking prosecutor.

542
00:39:09,892 --> 00:39:13,687
- My brother's a federal fucking "prostitutor."
- You don't say.

543
00:39:18,317 --> 00:39:19,735
Put this on.

544
00:39:21,695 --> 00:39:24,698
- Did you know about all that stuff?
- No, not all of it.

545
00:39:24,781 --> 00:39:27,117
- Maybe we should check into a hotel.
- Fuck that.

546
00:39:27,201 --> 00:39:28,493
I live here. This is my place.

547
00:39:28,577 --> 00:39:31,246
No one's getting me out of my place.
Put this on, too.

548
00:39:31,955 --> 00:39:35,209
- I'm hungry. I wanna eat.
- I heard you the first fucking five times.

549
00:39:39,963 --> 00:39:40,964
Come on.

550
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,593
Fucking around.

551
00:39:46,094 --> 00:39:48,138
When are we getting to the Baywatch?

552
00:39:49,223 --> 00:39:51,475
- What? What's that? You hear that?
- No.

553
00:39:51,517 --> 00:39:54,228
What is that? It's the walkie-talkie again.

554
00:39:55,062 --> 00:39:57,105
Hello? What?

555
00:39:58,357 --> 00:40:02,069
You got to be kidding me. Again?
What's the deal with these guys?

556
00:40:02,694 --> 00:40:04,988
How long? Maybe tomorrow? Okay.

557
00:40:05,113 --> 00:40:07,407
Kick those guys in the ass for me, will you?

558
00:40:07,824 --> 00:40:09,701
Those fucking guys. All right.

559
00:40:09,868 --> 00:40:11,912
Talk to you later. Give us a call back.

560
00:40:13,372 --> 00:40:14,831
Unbelievable.

561
00:40:14,998 --> 00:40:18,126
You believe that?
The Baywatch is closed today. Again.

562
00:40:18,252 --> 00:40:20,170
- They're closed?
- Yeah, I talked to them.

563
00:40:20,254 --> 00:40:23,048
They said they're working on the problem,
but, you know...

564
00:40:23,215 --> 00:40:25,759
they don't know how long it's gonna be.

565
00:40:25,843 --> 00:40:27,427
What is the Baywatch?

566
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:33,559
It's where all the beautiful girls are.
They swim.

567
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,311
They swim there.

568
00:40:36,728 --> 00:40:40,983
- You're talking about the TV show?
- No, you... Not TV. That's TV.

569
00:40:42,109 --> 00:40:46,029
The Baywatch is where they really are.
They're really there.

570
00:40:47,614 --> 00:40:50,117
I think you could be friends there.

571
00:40:56,331 --> 00:40:59,877
I think that's where the sex is. I think so.

572
00:41:33,994 --> 00:41:37,623
- Hey, you wanna turn that down?
- You fucking turn it down.

573
00:41:40,834 --> 00:41:44,421
I don't think this is the best time
to be drawing attention to ourselves.

574
00:41:47,799 --> 00:41:52,596
- Hey, Beavis, turn the fucking radio off.
- What the fuck is your problem, bitch?

575
00:41:53,764 --> 00:41:54,765
"Bitch"?

576
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:58,060
You know what, creating a scene right now
would be a bad thing.

577
00:42:00,312 --> 00:42:03,607
Yeah, that's right. Why don't you come here
so we can kick your ass.

578
00:42:09,738 --> 00:42:11,240
What happened?

579
00:42:11,865 --> 00:42:13,534
Let me. Okay?

580
00:42:16,245 --> 00:42:17,287
Go ahead.

581
00:42:18,622 --> 00:42:22,501
You know, what you boys need
is to develop better people skills.

582
00:42:22,793 --> 00:42:25,379
However, in the meantime...

583
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:29,424
Excuse me.

584
00:42:33,262 --> 00:42:34,972
You ever heard of Tai Moi Chai?

585
00:42:35,806 --> 00:42:37,307
No. Okay.

586
00:42:37,766 --> 00:42:42,354
In traditional Tai Moi Chai,
there are five levels of digital orb extrusion.

587
00:42:43,063 --> 00:42:45,816
That's the gouging out
of your opponent's eyeball...

588
00:42:46,525 --> 00:42:48,193
with one's finger.

589
00:42:49,361 --> 00:42:53,323
The highest and most difficult to master
is my personal favorite:

590
00:42:53,615 --> 00:42:54,700
"Kai Toi Mai".

591
00:42:54,783 --> 00:42:58,328
Loosely translated,
that's "the rip that takes the past."

592
00:42:58,537 --> 00:43:01,707
Now, once the thumb liquefies the eye...

593
00:43:02,583 --> 00:43:06,128
it is deftly and immediately replaced
by the forefinger.

594
00:43:06,628 --> 00:43:10,424
Deep thrust, hooking around
and securing the ocular nerve...

595
00:43:11,216 --> 00:43:13,886
and then removing it with such force...

596
00:43:14,553 --> 00:43:18,849
as to bring with it, by suction,
a vital portion of the visual cortex.

597
00:43:19,808 --> 00:43:23,729
The part of the brain, as I'm sure
you may know, that stores visual memory.

598
00:43:26,148 --> 00:43:28,275
The extraordinary element of this move...

599
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:32,029
the genius of it...

600
00:43:32,654 --> 00:43:35,449
the absolute poetry of it...

601
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:39,203
is that, aside from the obvious wound...

602
00:43:39,870 --> 00:43:43,999
one's opponent is left with no memory
of anything he has ever seen.

603
00:43:44,917 --> 00:43:47,669
Family, friends, nothing.

604
00:43:49,505 --> 00:43:51,757
Hence, "Kai Toi Mai":

605
00:43:54,051 --> 00:43:55,886
"The rip that takes the past."

606
00:43:57,721 --> 00:44:01,058
As you can imagine, very difficult
to practice in the United States...

607
00:44:01,141 --> 00:44:05,187
but I felt well worth the trips
to the Chang Rai Province.

608
00:44:11,235 --> 00:44:12,694
People skills.

609
00:44:13,946 --> 00:44:16,573
See, knowing
how to properly judge character...

610
00:44:16,615 --> 00:44:18,283
knowing how and when to make a move...

611
00:44:18,367 --> 00:44:20,953
in short,
knowing who to and who not to fuck with.

612
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:27,209
These are things you boys are gonna
wanna work on in the future. Okay?

613
00:44:27,709 --> 00:44:28,877
And one more thing:

614
00:44:28,961 --> 00:44:32,422
Sports are all well and good,
but very hard to earn a living at.

615
00:44:32,506 --> 00:44:36,426
So I want you guys to study hard
and keep your grades up, all right?

616
00:44:36,969 --> 00:44:39,012
- Okay? Everyone, yes?
- Yes.

617
00:44:39,096 --> 00:44:40,430
Okay. Good.

618
00:44:45,018 --> 00:44:46,770
Brian, let's go.

619
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,739
Nice computer.

620
00:45:00,659 --> 00:45:03,161
Here's suck-my-dick. Com.

621
00:45:10,752 --> 00:45:13,630
So can you really do all that kung fu shit...

622
00:45:13,797 --> 00:45:16,258
you said back there with the eye and that?

623
00:45:17,926 --> 00:45:18,927
No.

624
00:45:20,387 --> 00:45:22,264
That was all bullshit?

625
00:45:26,685 --> 00:45:28,896
Sun Tzu said that in a war...

626
00:45:29,479 --> 00:45:32,316
the best victory
is that which requires no battle.

627
00:45:33,025 --> 00:45:36,195
- Is this some more bullshit now I'm getting?
- No.

628
00:45:36,695 --> 00:45:37,863
Who's Sun Tzu?

629
00:45:39,406 --> 00:45:42,409
A Chinese military theoretician
who pointed out...

630
00:45:42,826 --> 00:45:46,872
that in a conflict, getting angry,
which you seem to do a lot of...

631
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:49,917
is a tactically and strategically stupid move.

632
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:54,713
It clouds your ability to reason.
It gives your adversary the upper hand.

633
00:45:55,589 --> 00:45:58,217
You wanna cloud
your adversary's ability to reason...

634
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:00,886
thus gaining the upper hand yourself.

635
00:46:04,598 --> 00:46:05,849
Whatever.

636
00:46:06,767 --> 00:46:08,810
You know,
given how unhappy you seem to be...

637
00:46:08,894 --> 00:46:11,939
I can see how that wouldn't be
the easiest thing for you to do.

638
00:46:12,397 --> 00:46:15,234
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Just that.

639
00:46:16,485 --> 00:46:17,736
I mean...

640
00:46:18,403 --> 00:46:22,157
when men are boys, they're encouraged
not to cry, not to show their sadness...

641
00:46:22,241 --> 00:46:26,453
so they're forced to find other ways to let
those feelings out. As I'm sure you know...

642
00:46:26,537 --> 00:46:30,874
fighting and getting angry
are much more acceptable male behaviors.

643
00:46:31,375 --> 00:46:35,671
So when these boys grow up, guess what
outlet they use to express their sadness.

644
00:46:36,255 --> 00:46:39,216
A guy who's miserable at work
or depressed about his life...

645
00:46:39,258 --> 00:46:41,301
comes home at night, what does he do?

646
00:46:42,636 --> 00:46:46,014
He doesn't usually cry
in front of the wife and kids.

647
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:48,350
He usually yells at them.

648
00:46:53,438 --> 00:46:54,898
So, Larry...

649
00:46:56,108 --> 00:46:57,192
What?

650
00:46:58,402 --> 00:47:00,779
What is it exactly you're so sad about?

651
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:04,825
No, I'm serious.

652
00:47:16,503 --> 00:47:18,964
Yeah. What about your friend?

653
00:47:19,631 --> 00:47:22,134
Mrs. Leonard. Whatever her name is.

654
00:47:25,971 --> 00:47:29,516
Look, I can't right now, I'm sorry.
It's not a good time.

655
00:47:29,808 --> 00:47:32,394
It's not a good time, Ma, that's why.

656
00:47:33,395 --> 00:47:34,396
No.

657
00:47:35,105 --> 00:47:37,399
Okay. All right!

658
00:47:38,317 --> 00:47:41,361
What do you want, blood?
I said okay. I'm coming over, all right?

659
00:47:41,445 --> 00:47:42,863
I'll be right over there.

660
00:47:45,782 --> 00:47:49,244
I got to make a quick detour.
You can stay in the car.

661
00:47:51,246 --> 00:47:53,123
Easy. A little lower.

662
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:55,876
- Right here?
- A little bit higher.

663
00:47:56,043 --> 00:47:57,294
- A little lower.
- Ma.

664
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:02,174
All right, right there. God.

665
00:48:02,841 --> 00:48:06,762
Look, Ma, if Mrs. Leonard isn't around,
you'll have to call a doctor sometimes.

666
00:48:06,845 --> 00:48:10,098
I can't just drop everything
and show up here all the time, okay?

667
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:12,643
What, and I didn't drop everything for you?

668
00:48:13,268 --> 00:48:16,146
"I'm so sorry, Larry,
I can't change your diaper now.

669
00:48:16,188 --> 00:48:18,982
"You're gonna have to call Mrs. Leonard."

670
00:48:20,025 --> 00:48:22,319
- Let me just...
- Let me. Hold on.

671
00:48:31,411 --> 00:48:32,996
- What?
- He's got to pee.

672
00:48:33,372 --> 00:48:34,623
I got to pee, Larry.

673
00:48:35,999 --> 00:48:37,876
I thought I told you to wait in the car.

674
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:41,505
I thought you'd prefer it if we came in
rather than take the car somewhere.

675
00:48:41,588 --> 00:48:44,216
Wouldn't want you to think
we lammed out on you.

676
00:48:44,383 --> 00:48:46,593
Besides, I want to meet your mother.

677
00:48:47,594 --> 00:48:50,389
- No.
- Larry, are those friends of yours?

678
00:48:53,058 --> 00:48:56,061
- Yeah, close, personal.
- Well, invite them in.

679
00:48:56,562 --> 00:48:58,230
I got to pee, Larry.

680
00:48:58,355 --> 00:49:02,192
- Larry, invite them in!
- I am, Ma, all right?

681
00:49:10,826 --> 00:49:13,078
- Hello, everybody.
- Hello.

682
00:49:13,787 --> 00:49:15,122
My God.

683
00:49:16,373 --> 00:49:18,041
- What a beauty.
- Ma.

684
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:20,169
What? I'm just saying.

685
00:49:20,586 --> 00:49:22,838
You should see some of the pigs
he's brought by.

686
00:49:22,921 --> 00:49:24,882
I mean, not that they were pigs, per se.

687
00:49:24,923 --> 00:49:29,803
It's just that, by and large, they were
what I would call insignificant women.

688
00:49:30,679 --> 00:49:34,391
You, I could tell right off the bat,
you seem to be of some substance.

689
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:39,479
- Excuse me, miss, where's the men's room?
- Right this way, darling.

690
00:49:40,397 --> 00:49:44,109
Larry, she's gorgeous.
Don't you fuck this one up.

691
00:49:46,278 --> 00:49:49,531
- So, what is your story, honey?
- I'm Larry's friend.

692
00:49:49,615 --> 00:49:52,284
- Don't pay no attention to her.
- She thinks I'm beautiful.

693
00:49:52,367 --> 00:49:54,870
Yeah. She's blind in one eye, though.

694
00:49:55,037 --> 00:49:56,413
Open the door.

695
00:49:58,332 --> 00:49:59,666
You all right in there?

696
00:50:00,292 --> 00:50:02,461
So this is where you grew up?

697
00:50:03,462 --> 00:50:05,380
Are you writing a book?

698
00:50:14,932 --> 00:50:18,685
- Ma.
- Shut up. I didn't say anything.

699
00:50:20,354 --> 00:50:23,190
I think you two
make a very cute couple, though.

700
00:50:23,273 --> 00:50:24,733
- Ma.
- What?

701
00:50:24,816 --> 00:50:27,819
What's with the "Ma"?

702
00:50:27,903 --> 00:50:29,404
Stop already with the "Ma."

703
00:50:31,073 --> 00:50:32,783
So, tell me...

704
00:50:33,784 --> 00:50:35,244
are you and Larry sweethearts?

705
00:50:35,327 --> 00:50:39,456
Before you answer,
let me say up front that I hope so.

706
00:50:40,165 --> 00:50:42,334
What? Yes, I hope so.

707
00:50:42,668 --> 00:50:44,628
What's so terrible about "I hope so"?

708
00:50:44,962 --> 00:50:46,630
- Yeah? Guess what.
- What?

709
00:50:46,672 --> 00:50:48,090
She's a lesbian.

710
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:55,973
Never mind.

711
00:50:56,682 --> 00:50:59,977
She's been with fellas before.
Am I right, darling?

712
00:51:02,938 --> 00:51:04,398
You're right.

713
00:51:04,773 --> 00:51:08,694
But sometimes they have their limitations.
Am I right?

714
00:51:14,324 --> 00:51:15,784
What are you two talking about?

715
00:51:15,868 --> 00:51:18,620
Never mind.
We know what we're talking about.

716
00:51:19,037 --> 00:51:21,623
- Am I right, sweetheart?
- You're right.

717
00:51:22,374 --> 00:51:25,669
You know,
I wasn't always just Larry's mother.

718
00:51:26,378 --> 00:51:27,880
I used to be...

719
00:51:28,839 --> 00:51:30,549
quite experimental.

720
00:51:31,091 --> 00:51:32,676
- Jesus Christ!
- Look at him!

721
00:51:32,759 --> 00:51:35,012
Look who's not up-to-the-minute now.

722
00:51:35,053 --> 00:51:36,930
- Big boy.
- That's it. We're going.

723
00:51:37,014 --> 00:51:39,474
Brian, come on. We're going. That's it.
Ma, what...

724
00:51:39,516 --> 00:51:43,187
All right. Just remember, you two,
life's not just black-and-white.

725
00:51:43,228 --> 00:51:46,523
All right, we'll remember that.
Brian, let's go. We're going now.

726
00:51:46,565 --> 00:51:49,193
- Let's go.
- Come here, you big lug, give me a kiss.

727
00:51:50,527 --> 00:51:51,862
- I love you.
- Yeah.

728
00:51:51,945 --> 00:51:54,448
- I washed my hands.
- Congratulations. Let's go.

729
00:51:54,531 --> 00:51:56,533
- Goodbye.
- Come here, darling.

730
00:51:58,744 --> 00:52:00,579
I feel like I know you already.

731
00:52:00,662 --> 00:52:02,539
- Very nice meeting you.
- It's my pleasure.

732
00:52:02,581 --> 00:52:06,293
All right, we're going. Let's go.
Come on. Let's go, Brian.

733
00:52:06,585 --> 00:52:10,672
Just remember, you two, keep an open mind
because you never know.

734
00:52:10,756 --> 00:52:12,216
- We will.
- Bye!

735
00:52:12,841 --> 00:52:14,927
- I like her, she's very nice.
- Man.

736
00:52:25,979 --> 00:52:28,232
{y:i}On the satellite map,
{y:i}the cloud over Queensland...

737
00:52:28,315 --> 00:52:30,359
{y:i}and New South Wales is bringing showers...

738
00:52:30,442 --> 00:52:33,403
{y:i}and there's very little activity
{y:i}over the rest of the continent.

739
00:52:33,487 --> 00:52:36,281
{y:i}But there is some low-level cloud
{y:i}over Southern Victoria...

740
00:52:36,365 --> 00:52:39,326
{y:i}which will bring isolated showers
{y:i}mainly to the coastal areas.

741
00:52:39,409 --> 00:52:42,538
{y:i}Another chilly night in Melbourne's suburbs
{y:i}with the mercury...

742
00:52:43,121 --> 00:52:45,707
- What are you doing now?
{y:i}...and Avalon falling as low...

743
00:52:45,791 --> 00:52:49,586
- Brian, I told you, this is very expensive.
- It's not expensive.

744
00:52:50,546 --> 00:52:51,797
Don't argue with me.

745
00:52:53,006 --> 00:52:56,885
Why are you doing this? What do you care
about the weather in fucking England for?

746
00:52:57,052 --> 00:52:59,054
- Australia.
- Whatever.

747
00:52:59,555 --> 00:53:00,681
It's not England.

748
00:53:00,764 --> 00:53:03,809
Whatever, Brian.
Why do you keep calling there?

749
00:53:07,771 --> 00:53:09,731
I really like her voice.

750
00:53:15,112 --> 00:53:18,115
Okay. Try to keep it under control, though.

751
00:53:18,699 --> 00:53:20,576
- All right?
- Okay, Larry, I'll try.

752
00:53:20,701 --> 00:53:22,786
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

753
00:53:46,393 --> 00:53:48,187
So I'm not your type?

754
00:53:50,189 --> 00:53:52,983
How did we get back there all of a sudden?

755
00:53:53,859 --> 00:53:54,860
Relax.

756
00:53:55,527 --> 00:53:57,821
You're more woman
than I know what to do with.

757
00:53:57,905 --> 00:54:00,616
I don't need to be dipping
into the sisterhood.

758
00:54:01,491 --> 00:54:04,661
But I'm just curious
because all of a sudden now...

759
00:54:04,703 --> 00:54:06,330
you say you've been with guys.

760
00:54:07,706 --> 00:54:08,916
I have.

761
00:54:10,501 --> 00:54:13,337
But they have their shortcomings?

762
00:54:13,921 --> 00:54:16,340
Besides the fact that they give terrible head.

763
00:54:17,424 --> 00:54:19,927
See, right there, that tells me something.

764
00:54:20,719 --> 00:54:24,306
I know the guys you've been with
obviously didn't know...

765
00:54:24,556 --> 00:54:27,643
how to bring home the pearls
when they were diving for oysters.

766
00:54:28,727 --> 00:54:30,562
I was actually just joking.

767
00:54:30,687 --> 00:54:34,983
Well, since we're letting it all hang out now,
let me tell you something else.

768
00:54:35,067 --> 00:54:39,530
Okay, when it comes to pleasing a woman,
your girlfriends, they're just...

769
00:54:40,155 --> 00:54:42,574
they're at a natural disadvantage.

770
00:54:42,741 --> 00:54:46,036
It's like they might try hard,
but they're just not backed up...

771
00:54:46,119 --> 00:54:51,041
with millions of years of
genetic engineering, programming, instinct.

772
00:54:52,167 --> 00:54:55,838
Nature has evolved man for that purpose.

773
00:54:56,755 --> 00:54:58,006
Satisfy.

774
00:54:58,924 --> 00:55:00,384
Lead the pack.

775
00:55:02,094 --> 00:55:06,974
That's why lesbians are always buying,
spending their dough on, you know...

776
00:55:07,057 --> 00:55:11,895
sexual appliances, erotic monkey wrenches
and shit, trying to compensate...

777
00:55:12,855 --> 00:55:16,108
for what they don't have.
What they're not getting.

778
00:55:17,276 --> 00:55:19,862
The penis. That's right.

779
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:24,992
Its very design
tells you everything you need to know.

780
00:55:26,827 --> 00:55:29,955
Forward motion. With advancements.

781
00:55:30,289 --> 00:55:33,667
Fucking progress into the dark, deep...

782
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:36,503
mysterious unknown.

783
00:55:38,088 --> 00:55:40,716
It's like adventure-seeking...

784
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:42,885
frontier-conquering...

785
00:55:44,011 --> 00:55:45,470
obstacle-eradicating.

786
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:51,727
And you tried to create the impression
you didn't read books.

787
00:55:52,269 --> 00:55:55,314
You're settling for second best.
That's all I'm saying.

788
00:55:55,606 --> 00:55:57,941
So, in review...

789
00:55:58,942 --> 00:56:00,152
you're saying...

790
00:56:00,736 --> 00:56:04,531
that it's men
that are at the top of the must-fuck pyramid?

791
00:56:05,365 --> 00:56:07,451
That's all I'm telling you.

792
00:56:08,410 --> 00:56:10,120
Loving, caring...

793
00:56:10,871 --> 00:56:14,124
- sensitive, giving men.
- That's right.

794
00:56:15,876 --> 00:56:18,212
You're entitled to your opinion.

795
00:56:21,381 --> 00:56:24,718
But let us reconsider women for a minute.

796
00:56:24,968 --> 00:56:26,678
- Shall we?
- Sure.

797
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:28,972
Their form:

798
00:56:31,183 --> 00:56:33,185
Neck. Shoulders.

799
00:56:35,479 --> 00:56:36,480
Legs.

800
00:56:37,773 --> 00:56:38,774
Hips.

801
00:56:40,651 --> 00:56:42,319
I think pretty cool.

802
00:56:43,737 --> 00:56:45,948
Now, as far as your famous...

803
00:56:46,949 --> 00:56:48,325
penis goes...

804
00:56:49,159 --> 00:56:51,411
The penis is like some sort of...

805
00:56:51,995 --> 00:56:54,331
bizarre sea slug...

806
00:56:54,373 --> 00:56:57,334
or like a really long toe.

807
00:56:58,168 --> 00:57:03,006
I mean, it's handy, important even.
But the pinnacle of sexual design?

808
00:57:03,382 --> 00:57:07,261
The top of the list of erotic destinations?
I don't think so.

809
00:57:08,887 --> 00:57:12,933
One's first impulse is to kiss what?

810
00:57:16,186 --> 00:57:17,855
To kiss the lips.

811
00:57:19,106 --> 00:57:20,148
Firm...

812
00:57:20,399 --> 00:57:23,694
delicious lips. Sweet lips.

813
00:57:25,529 --> 00:57:28,365
Surrounding a warm, moist...

814
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,160
dizzyingly scented mouth.

815
00:57:33,495 --> 00:57:35,998
That's what everyone wants to kiss.

816
00:57:36,582 --> 00:57:39,501
Not a toe. Not a sea slug.

817
00:57:40,794 --> 00:57:42,045
A mouth.

818
00:57:44,006 --> 00:57:45,883
And why do you think that is, stupid?

819
00:57:49,511 --> 00:57:52,556
Because the mouth is the twin sister...

820
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:55,601
the almost exact look-alike of the what?

821
00:57:58,645 --> 00:58:00,063
Not the toe.

822
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:04,109
The mouth is the twin sister...

823
00:58:04,610 --> 00:58:07,571
of the vagina.

824
00:58:12,451 --> 00:58:16,663
And all creatures big and small
seek the orifice.

825
00:58:16,788 --> 00:58:20,542
The opening. To be taken in, engulfed.

826
00:58:21,585 --> 00:58:25,047
To be squeezed and lovingly crushed
by what is truly...

827
00:58:26,131 --> 00:58:28,592
the all-powerful, all-encompassing.

828
00:58:29,343 --> 00:58:32,012
Now, if it's design you're concerned with...

829
00:58:32,095 --> 00:58:34,681
hidden meanings, symbolism and power...

830
00:58:36,308 --> 00:58:37,809
forget the top of Mount Everest.

831
00:58:37,893 --> 00:58:41,271
Forget the bottom of the sea,
the moon, the stars.

832
00:58:41,313 --> 00:58:44,107
There is no place, nowhere,
that has been the object...

833
00:58:44,149 --> 00:58:48,946
of more ambitions, more battles
than the sweet, sacred mystery...

834
00:58:49,821 --> 00:58:53,116
between a woman's legs
that I am proud to call...

835
00:58:54,826 --> 00:58:56,036
my pussy.

836
00:58:59,331 --> 00:59:01,917
So I guess this is just my roundabout way
of saying...

837
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,754
that it is women who are,
in fact, the most desirable form.

838
00:59:07,589 --> 00:59:09,299
Wouldn't you agree?

839
00:59:11,802 --> 00:59:12,928
I agree.

840
00:59:14,972 --> 00:59:16,390
And so do I.

841
00:59:30,153 --> 00:59:31,238
{y:i}Hello?

842
00:59:39,496 --> 00:59:41,957
{y:i}- Is somebody there?
- Yes.

843
00:59:43,458 --> 00:59:44,459
Who's this?

844
00:59:49,381 --> 00:59:50,674
I don't find this funny.

845
00:59:53,677 --> 00:59:54,845
Is this the retard?

846
00:59:56,722 --> 01:00:00,309
Brian, what are you doing now?
Give me the fucking phone.

847
01:00:03,395 --> 01:00:04,396
Hello?

848
01:00:04,771 --> 01:00:05,939
Who the fuck is this?

849
01:00:07,524 --> 01:00:09,193
What the fuck is going on over there?

850
01:00:10,527 --> 01:00:12,196
Nothing. Sorry, Louis.

851
01:00:12,738 --> 01:00:14,448
{y:i}We're not getting the desired movement.

852
01:00:14,531 --> 01:00:16,074
{y:i}We're stepping up the operation.

853
01:00:16,366 --> 01:00:20,704
First thing in the morning, send his thumb
to James Dorf... Are you listening?

854
01:00:21,330 --> 01:00:23,123
- Yeah.
{y:i}- Good.

855
01:00:23,207 --> 01:00:26,627
{y:i}To James Dorf
{y:i}at the U.S. Courthouse on Spring Street.

856
01:00:28,754 --> 01:00:31,548
Hold on one second. Go in the other room.

857
01:00:32,132 --> 01:00:35,052
Go in the other room in the back.
Go in the back.

858
01:00:35,135 --> 01:00:37,930
I'm talking on the phone. Go in the back.

859
01:00:39,389 --> 01:00:41,892
What do you mean?
How do I send his thumb?

860
01:00:42,059 --> 01:00:44,770
You cut it the fuck off.
You take it to Boxes 'R' Us...

861
01:00:44,853 --> 01:00:47,814
{y:i}or whatever it is.
{y:i}You put the appropriate postage on it...

862
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:51,401
and that's how you send it.
Send it express next-day delivery.

863
01:00:51,443 --> 01:00:55,781
Make sure you kindly refrain from providing
a return address, you fucking dummy.

864
01:00:56,031 --> 01:00:57,115
I mean...

865
01:00:58,242 --> 01:01:00,077
You want me to cut his thumb off?

866
01:01:00,118 --> 01:01:02,663
It's enough already. Put the clam-licker on.

867
01:01:03,288 --> 01:01:06,959
Hold on. Wait a minute.
What about, like, the bleeding and the...

868
01:01:07,084 --> 01:01:09,545
I can't believe I'm talking to a professional.

869
01:01:09,586 --> 01:01:12,422
I'll send people to help you,
they'll take your thumb, too.

870
01:01:12,631 --> 01:01:15,592
- I'm not saying that.
{y:i}- I don't like the habit of hiring you...

871
01:01:15,801 --> 01:01:19,012
and then having to hire someone
to make sure you do your job right.

872
01:01:19,096 --> 01:01:20,806
{y:i}Do your fucking job right, you hear me?

873
01:01:20,889 --> 01:01:22,432
I'm getting tired of this.

874
01:01:31,108 --> 01:01:32,985
- Larry.
- What?

875
01:01:34,236 --> 01:01:35,737
Can I stay here with you?

876
01:01:37,656 --> 01:01:38,657
No.

877
01:01:41,118 --> 01:01:44,204
- Time for you to go to bed anyways.
- I don't want to go to bed.

878
01:01:44,288 --> 01:01:48,834
- Lf I tell you to go to bed, go to bed.
- I don't want to go to bed, though.

879
01:01:50,919 --> 01:01:53,213
"New. Our best Charmin ever.

880
01:01:53,338 --> 01:01:54,923
"Charmin Ultra Double Roll.

881
01:01:55,007 --> 01:01:57,467
"Twice as many sheets
