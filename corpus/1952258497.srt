CLIVE: (HEAVILY ACCENTED)
Dr Gopnik, I believe the results

63
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,853
of the physics midterm
were unjust.

64
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:58,586
Uh-huh? How so?

65
00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:00,928
I received
unsatisfactory grade.

66
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:03,263
In fact, F,
the failing grade.

67
00:15:03,803 --> 00:15:07,034
Yes. You failed the midterm.
That's accurate.

68
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:08,698
Yes, but that is not just.

69
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:11,910
I was unaware to be
examined on the mathematics.

70
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:15,141
Well, you can't do physics without
mathematics, really, can you?

71
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:18,706
If I receive the failing
grade, I lose my scholarship,

72
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:20,082
and I feel shame.

73
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:23,819
I understand the physics.
I understand the dead cat.

74
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:27,484
But you can't really
understand the physics

75
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,322
without understanding
the math.

76
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:33,160

works That's the real thing.

77
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:36,827

80
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,809
Even I don't understand
the dead cat.

81
00:15:45,912 --> 00:15:47,777

it really works.

00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:49,178

Well, I'm sorry, but I...

85
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:53,944
What do you propose?

86
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,146
- Passing grade.
- No, no.

87
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:57,449
Or perhaps I can
take the midterm again.

88
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:59,286
I know now it cover
the mathematics.

89
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:02,088
Well, the other students
wouldn't like that, would they?

00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:05,688

test until he gets a grade he likes?

- No...

- No.

00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:11,761

too. Inside the case.

How come?

119
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:36,545
Bought a lid from Mike
Fagle a couple of weeks ago.

120
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:37,714
Still owed him 20.

121

He already
gave you the pot?

122
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,888
Yeah. But a couple of weeks
ago, my funding got cut off.

123
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:45,730

out of me if I didn't pay up.

he was confiscating it.

do you get your money?

00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:08,405

you and I have been having?

156
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:09,531
Mmm-hmm.

157
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:12,236
Well, Sy and I
have become very close.

158
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,744
In short, I think it's time that
we start talking about a divorce.

160
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:27,057
This is not about Sy.

Larry.

163
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:33,523

I haven't done anything.

Larry, don't be a child.

165
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:38,298
You haven't done anything.
I haven't done anything.

166
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:41,567
Yes! Yes, we haven't
done anything.

167
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,632
And I'm probably
about to get tenure.

168
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:48,145

been problems, as you know...

169
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,579

- ...and things have changed.

that mean? You barely know him.

00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:41,835
Uh-huh.

356
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:42,929
That's great.

357
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:46,976
- Mr. Brandt...
- I said scrub up, Mitch!

358
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:53,316
Isn't this a school day?

359
00:35:53,385 --> 00:35:55,444
I took him out of school today
so he could hunt with his dad.

360
00:35:58,723 --> 00:36:00,554
(CLEARING THROAT)
Uh, Mr Brandt,

361
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:02,627
that's just about at
the property line there.

362
00:36:02,694 --> 00:36:04,059
I don't think
we're supposed to get

363
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,789
...within, what, 10 feet...
- Property line's the poplar.

364
00:36:08,066 --> 00:36:09,294
- The...
- Poplar.

365
00:36:09,968 --> 00:36:12,630
- Well, even if it is, you're just
about over it. - Measure.

366
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:15,706
- I don't have to measure, you
can tell it's... - Line's the poplar.

367
00:36:17,142 --> 00:36:18,200
What's going on?

368
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:19,667
Nothing.

369
00:36:22,414 --> 00:36:24,177
- JUDITH: Larry?
- Yeah?

370
00:36:24,249 --> 00:36:25,841
Did you go to
Sieglestein Schlutz?

371
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:27,009
LARRY: No, I...
Not yet.

372
00:36:27,085 --> 00:36:28,143
Larry.

373
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:29,481
Appointment Monday.

374
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:30,851
Where are you going?

375
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:32,184
I'm going to the Hole.

376
00:36:32,257 --> 00:36:33,849
What? At 5:00?

377
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:36,416
We're stopping at Laurie Kipperstein's
house so I can wash my hair.

378
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,052
Hi, Mr Gopnik.

379
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,591
- You can't wash it here?
- Uncle Arthur's in the bathroom.

380
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:42,257
ARTHUR: I'll be out
in a minute!

381
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:43,425
- JUDITH: Are you ready?
- Huh?

382
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:45,025
- We're meeting Sy at Embers.
- I am?

383
00:36:45,103 --> 00:36:47,435
Both of us.
I told you, Larry.

384
00:36:49,441 --> 00:36:50,669
Larry.

385
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,104
How are you?

386
00:36:57,916 --> 00:36:58,940
Sy.

387
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:02,543
Hello, Judith.

388
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:03,609
Hello, Sy.

389
00:37:05,857 --> 00:37:09,088
Larry, I want to
thank you for coming.

390
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:12,921
It's so important that we be
able to discuss these things.

391
00:37:13,031 --> 00:37:14,726
I'm happy to come
to Embers, Sy.

392
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:17,290
But I'm thinking, really,
maybe it's best to leave

393
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:18,733
these discussions
to the lawyers.

394
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:21,636
Of course Legal matters,
you let the lawyers discuss.

395
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,731
You don't mix
apples and oranges.

396
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:25,241
I have begged you
to see the lawyer.

397
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:26,572
I told you,
I'm going Monday.

398
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:29,306
Monday is timely.
This is not...

399
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:33,077
Please, Embers is not the forum
for legalities You're so right.

400
00:37:33,151 --> 00:37:34,243
(SCOFFS)

401
00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:37,811
No, Judith and I wanted
merely to discuss, uh,

402
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:41,090
practicalities.
Living arrangements.

403
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:45,259
After all, this is an issue
where no one is at odds.

404
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:46,490
Living arrangements?

405
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:50,896
I think we all agree
that the children

406
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:54,063
not being contaminated
with the tension,

407
00:37:54,139 --> 00:37:55,265
the most important.

408
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,331
We shouldn't put the kids
in the middle of this, Larry.

409
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:58,466
The kids aren't...

410
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:00,476
I'm saying "we."
I'm not pointing fingers.

411
00:38:00,578 --> 00:38:03,274
No one is playing
the blame game, Larry.

412
00:38:03,348 --> 00:38:04,440
I didn't say
anyone was.

413
00:38:04,516 --> 00:38:06,484
Well, let's not play "He
Said, She Said," either.

414
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:08,609
- I wasn't! I...
- All right. Look, look, look.

415
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:12,452
Let's just take a step back and
we can diffuse the situation.

416
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:18,153
You know, Larry,
sometimes I find that

417
00:38:18,263 --> 00:38:19,924
if I count to 10...

418
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:22,924
One,

419
00:38:24,202 --> 00:38:25,191
two,

420
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:27,762
three,

421
00:38:29,207 --> 00:38:30,435
four...

422
00:38:30,842 --> 00:38:32,707
Or silently.

423
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,813
Really, to keep things
on an even keel

424
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:44,787
leading up to
Danny's bar mitzvah...

425
00:38:44,856 --> 00:38:46,653
A child's
bar mitzvah, Larry.

426
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:50,455
Sy and I think it's best if
you move out of the house.

427
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:52,785
Move out?

428
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:55,331
- Well, it makes eminent sense.
- Things can't continue as they...

429
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,867
Move out?
Where would I go?

430
00:38:56,968 --> 00:39:00,028
Well, for instance, the
Jolly Roger is quite livable.

431
00:39:00,138 --> 00:39:01,400
It's not expensive.

432
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:04,066
The rooms are
eminently habitable.

433
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,665
This would allow you
to visit the kids.

434
00:39:05,743 --> 00:39:07,836
There's convenience in its
favor They've got a pool.

435
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:10,574
Wouldn't it make more sense
for you to move in with Sy?

436
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:13,642
Larry.

437
00:39:14,052 --> 00:39:17,180
Larry, you...
You are jesting.

438
00:39:18,223 --> 00:39:21,021
I think, really,
the Jolly Roger

439
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:24,152
is the appropriate
course of action.

I don't think it's that.

- Yes.
- No,

461
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:15,738
it would be a culture clash if
it were the custom in your land

00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:17,246
to bribe people
for grades.

463
00:40:17,315 --> 00:40:18,441
Yes.

464
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:22,145
So, you're saying
it is the custom?

465
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:25,552
No, this is defamation.
Ground for lawsuit.

00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:27,249
Let me get this straight.

467
00:40:27,325 --> 00:40:29,919
You're threatening to sue
me for defaming your son?

468

Yes.

See, look...

473
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:50,608
If it were defamation,
there would have to be

474
00:40:50,682 --> 00:40:52,775
someone I was defaming him to, or I...

475
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,909
All right,
let's keep it simple.

476
00:40:54,986 --> 00:40:58,422
I could pretend the money never
appeared That's not defaming anyone.

Yes. And passing grade.

00:41:01,526 --> 00:41:03,153
- Passing grade?
- Yes.

479
00:41:04,162 --> 00:41:05,754

481
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:08,794

This is defamation!

483
00:41:11,369 --> 00:41:14,463

he left the money or he didn't.

good with numbers.

487
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:34,055
I think his social skills
have held him back.

488
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:36,149
Such a sweet man, though.

489
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:37,524
Arthur has
a good heart.

490
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:41,029
And he never complains,
unlike me.

491
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:44,000
Sometimes I don't
give him enough credit.

492
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:47,834
He tried to tell me about this
thing he's working on, this...

493
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:49,736
The Mentaculus.

494
00:41:50,575 --> 00:41:56,070
He says it's a probability
map of the universe.

495
00:41:57,081 --> 00:41:59,413
Does he go out
socially at all?

496
00:42:00,051 --> 00:42:03,509
He tries. He's been going to the
singles mixers at Hillel House.

497
00:42:05,757 --> 00:42:08,055
I should talk.
I'm not doing any better.

498
00:42:09,427 --> 00:42:10,689
How is Judith?

499
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:15,526
Fine. She's fine.

500
00:42:17,402 --> 00:42:20,371
Sometimes these things
just aren't meant to be.

501
00:42:20,438 --> 00:42:24,340
And it can take a while before
you feel what was always there.

502
00:42:24,409 --> 00:42:26,775
- For better or worse.
- I never felt it!

503
00:42:27,779 --> 00:42:30,077
It was a bolt
from the blue.

504
00:42:30,181 --> 00:42:31,375
What does that mean?

505
00:42:31,449 --> 00:42:35,215
Everything that I thought was
one way turns out to be another.

506
00:42:36,254 --> 00:42:40,918
Then, it's an opportunity to
learn how things really are.

507
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:43,692
I don't mean to sound glib.

508
00:42:46,097 --> 00:42:49,794
It's not always easy deciphering
what God is trying to tell you,

509
00:42:50,368 --> 00:42:53,531
but it's not something you have
to figure out all by yourself.

510
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:56,301
We're Jews.

511
00:42:56,774 --> 00:43:00,710
We've got that well of tradition
to draw on, to help us understand.

512
00:43:01,379 --> 00:43:04,075
When we're puzzled,
we have all the stories

513
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:07,879
that have been handed down from
people who had the same problems.

00:43:09,887 --> 00:43:11,912

515
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:16,627
Why not see him?

516
00:43:16,727 --> 00:43:18,388
What's the Rabbi
gonna tell me?

517
00:43:18,796 --> 00:43:20,491
If I knew,
I'd be the Rabbi.

518
00:43:20,832 --> 00:43:24,563
(EXCLAIMS) The air out
here is magnificent.

519
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:30,167

could bottle this air,

520
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:32,071
they'd make
a million dollars.

521
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,760

Good to see you.

522
00:43:50,828 --> 00:43:52,193
Oh. Rabbi Scott.

523
00:43:53,531 --> 00:43:55,658
I thought I was going
to see Rabbi Nachtner.

524
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:57,859
He was called away
on an etz monim.

526
00:44:01,772 --> 00:44:05,037
Rabbi Nachtner asked me to
cover for him. Come on in.

527
00:44:16,721 --> 00:44:20,122
And she wants a gett.

528
00:44:25,129 --> 00:44:26,221
A what?

529
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,697
- She wants a...
- Oh, a gett.

530
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:32,359
Uh-huh. Sure.

531
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:35,833
I feel like the carpet's
been yanked out from under me.

532
00:44:35,907 --> 00:44:38,171
(STAMMERING) I don't
know which end is up.

533
00:44:38,242 --> 00:44:40,039
I'm not even sure
how to react.

534
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:41,475
I'm too confused.

535
00:44:41,913 --> 00:44:45,576
What reasons did she
give for the rupture?

536
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:48,243
She didn't give reasons
Just that,

537
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:50,582
you know, things
haven't been going well.

538
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:51,746
And is that true?

539
00:44:52,423 --> 00:44:53,913
I guess.
I don't know.

540
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:56,186
She's usually right
about these things.

541
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:58,728
I was hoping that
Rabbi Nachtner could...

542
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:01,255
That he would...
He would... Yes?

543
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:03,595
Well, with the benefit
of his life experience.

544
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:05,528
No offense.

545
00:45:05,603 --> 00:45:08,766
(CHUCKLING) No, of course
not I am the junior rabbi.

546
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:13,206
And it's true, the point of
view of somebody who's older

547
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:17,714
and perhaps had similar
problems might be more valid.

548
00:45:17,782 --> 00:45:20,842
And you should see the senior
rabbi as well, by all means.

549
00:45:20,918 --> 00:45:22,112
Or even Marshak,

550
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:24,383
if you can get in.

551
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:27,049
He's quite busy,
but maybe...

552
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:32,919
Can I share
something with you?

553
00:45:33,297 --> 00:45:36,198
Because I, too, have had
the feeling of losing track

554
00:45:36,267 --> 00:45:39,065
of Hashem,
which is the problem here.

555
00:45:39,604 --> 00:45:42,402
I, too, have forgotten
how to see him in the world,

556
00:45:42,473 --> 00:45:44,532
and when that happens,
you think,

557
00:45:44,609 --> 00:45:48,602
"Well, if I can't see him,
he isn't there. He's gone."

558
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:50,471
But that's not the case.

559
00:45:50,982 --> 00:45:53,974
You just need to
remember how to see him.

560
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:56,383
(CHUCKLING)
Am I right? I mean...

561
00:45:57,488 --> 00:45:59,479
The parking lot here.

562
00:46:02,493 --> 00:46:03,926
Not much to see.

563
00:46:04,562 --> 00:46:07,258
But if you imagine
yourself a visitor,

564
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:12,001
somebody who isn't familiar
with these autos and such,

565
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:14,663
somebody still with
the capacity for wonder.

566
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:17,935
Someone with
a fresh perspective.

567
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:19,806
That's what it is, Larry.

568
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:21,935
Because with
the right perspective,

569
00:46:22,013 --> 00:46:25,471
you can see Hashem, you
know, reaching into the world.

570
00:46:25,583 --> 00:46:28,313
He is in the world,
not just in shul.

571
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:33,923
It sounds to me like you're looking
at the world, looking at your wife,

572
00:46:33,991 --> 00:46:35,925
through tired eyes.

573
00:46:36,594 --> 00:46:40,189
It sounds like she's
become a sort of thing...

574
00:46:40,931 --> 00:46:42,455
A problem.

575
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,126
A thing.

576
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:46,328
She is seeing Sy Ableman.

577
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:52,973
- Oh.
- They're planning...

578
00:46:53,044 --> 00:46:54,511
That's why
they want the gett.

579
00:46:54,612 --> 00:46:56,842
Oh I'm sorry.

580
00:46:56,947 --> 00:46:58,471
It was his idea.

581
00:46:58,549 --> 00:47:03,987
Well, they do need a gett
to remarry in the faith.

582
00:47:05,222 --> 00:47:08,214
But... This is life.

583
00:47:09,226 --> 00:47:13,060
You have to see these things
as expressions of God's will.

584
00:47:13,164 --> 00:47:15,064
You don't have to
like it, of course.

585
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:17,831
The boss isn't always right,
but he's always the boss.

586
00:47:17,902 --> 00:47:19,699
(LAUGHING)
That's right!

587
00:47:20,304 --> 00:47:21,532
Things aren't so bad.

588
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:23,903
Look at
the parking lot, Larry.

589
00:47:25,576 --> 00:47:27,806
Just look at
that parking lot.

590
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:33,142
(PANTING)

591
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:45,089
Are we eating already?

592
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:46,595
Sarah's going out.

593
00:47:47,264 --> 00:47:48,561
Ow! Cut it out!

594
00:47:48,666 --> 00:47:49,894
What's going on?

595
00:47:56,207 --> 00:47:57,196
Isn't Dad eating?

596
00:47:57,274 --> 00:47:58,605
JUDITH: He's at
the Jolly Roger.

597
00:47:59,677 --> 00:48:00,905
Oh, yeah.

598
00:48:01,445 --> 00:48:02,776
(ALL SLURPING)

599
00:48:06,283 --> 00:48:07,375
How are you, Larry?

600
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:09,942
Jesus, I am so sorry

601
00:48:10,087 --> 00:48:12,578
- to be seeing you under these
circumstances. - Oh, well...

602
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:15,250
I always thought you
and Judy were rock solid.

603
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:18,590
This is so terrible, Larry.
This is devastating.

604
00:48:18,696 --> 00:48:20,061
Well, you know,
the way I look at it,

605
00:48:20,131 --> 00:48:23,692
it's an opportunity for me to
really sit down and figure things out

606
00:48:23,768 --> 00:48:28,034
and look at the world afresh
instead of just, you know,

607
00:48:28,105 --> 00:48:32,041
settling for the routine, tired
old way of looking at things.

608
00:48:33,811 --> 00:48:34,937
Really?

609
00:48:36,247 --> 00:48:37,714
I don't know,
maybe not.

610
00:48:39,383 --> 00:48:42,716
Well, legally,
I have to warn you,

611
00:48:42,787 --> 00:48:45,255
it's never easy
for the husband.

612
00:48:45,322 --> 00:48:48,155
Unless, of course,
there's some question

613
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:52,491
of the wife having violated
the marriage contract?

614
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:54,621
Oh, no, no
Nothing like that.

615
00:48:54,732 --> 00:48:57,292
Although she is planning to
marry Sy Ableman, but they...

616
00:48:57,401 --> 00:48:58,766
Sy Ableman!

617
00:48:59,837 --> 00:49:02,931
- Yes. But they...
- Esther is barely cold!

618
00:49:03,741 --> 00:49:05,072
She passed
three years ago.

619
00:49:05,142 --> 00:49:09,340
Well... Still, this changes
the complexion, Larry.

620
00:49:09,814 --> 00:49:11,179
Sy Ableman.

621
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:14,080
Not in the sense that... T
here hasn't been hanky-panky.

622
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:15,243
To my knowledge.

623
00:49:15,352 --> 00:49:18,617
- Oh? - No I'm fairly
certain this is not an issue.

624
00:49:18,689 --> 00:49:21,852
And in fact,
Judith wants a gett.

625
00:49:24,428 --> 00:49:25,520
A what?

626
00:49:26,697 --> 00:49:28,187
A ritual divorce.

627
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:30,426
- Oh.
- So that they can remarry in the faith.

628
00:49:30,501 --> 00:49:32,765
Uh-huh.
Yeah, sure, uh...

629
00:49:32,837 --> 00:49:34,862
Well, not really
a legal issue.

630
00:49:36,774 --> 00:49:38,036
Okay, um...

631
00:49:39,109 --> 00:49:40,974
Good. Good.

632
00:49:41,779 --> 00:49:43,474
(SIGHING) Well...

633
00:49:43,547 --> 00:49:46,983
On the other thing, the
neighbor's property line,

634
00:49:47,051 --> 00:49:49,679
I've asked Solomon
Schlutz to take a look.

635
00:49:49,787 --> 00:49:53,154
There's very little to do with
real estate that'll get by Sol.

636
00:49:53,224 --> 00:49:54,987
Okay Good
How do you...

637
00:49:55,059 --> 00:49:56,549
I guess
I'm a little worried.

638
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,821
How do you...
I have money pressures...

639
00:49:58,896 --> 00:50:00,989
Our fee structure?
We bill by the hour.

640
00:50:01,065 --> 00:50:04,330
Dave Sieglestein and
Solomon Schlutz bill at 110.

641
00:50:04,401 --> 00:50:07,234
The associates, me,
for instance, bill at...

642
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:09,806
Call for Mr Gopnik
Danny at home.

643
00:50:09,874 --> 00:50:11,899
You can take it here.

Danny?

- DANNY: Hey, Dad.
- Are you all right?

647
00:50:19,917 --> 00:50:20,906
Are you all...

648
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:22,383
F Troop is fuzzy.

649
00:50:24,255 --> 00:50:25,517
What?

650
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:27,352
F Troop is still fuzzy.

651
00:50:30,261 --> 00:50:32,092
- Dad?
- Is everything okay?

652
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:40,094

Clive!

You little bastard! You
gonna send your mother next?

Hold on.

Professor Gopnik,
it's Dick Dutton again.

00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:26,867
Dick Dutton.

662
00:52:28,946 --> 00:52:29,970
Hello?

663
00:52:30,047 --> 00:52:31,605
Hello, Mr Gopnik?

664
00:52:31,682 --> 00:52:34,378
This is Dick Dutton from
the Columbia Record Club.

665
00:52:34,485 --> 00:52:37,511
I'm calling because
it's now four months,

666
00:52:37,621 --> 00:52:39,987
and we have yet to
receive your first payment.

667
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:43,983

There's some mistake.

668

I'm not a member
of the Columbian Record Club.

669
00:52:46,497 --> 00:52:50,194
Sir, you are Lawrence Gopnik
of 8419 Fern Hill Road?

670
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:51,995
No, I live
at the Jolly Roger.

671
00:52:52,069 --> 00:52:53,161
Excuse me?

672
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:55,134
No, I...

673
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:58,201
Well, yes, okay.

674
00:52:58,308 --> 00:53:00,208
- Yes, you are Lawrence Gopnik?
- Okay.

675
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:01,969
"Okay" means...

676
00:53:02,046 --> 00:53:04,310
Okay, yes,
Lawrence Gopnik, yes.

677
00:53:04,381 --> 00:53:07,350
Okay, well, you received
your 12 introductory albums,

678
00:53:07,418 --> 00:53:10,979
and you've been receiving the monthly
main selection for four months now...

00:53:11,055 --> 00:53:12,682
The monthly main selection?
Is that a record?

680
00:53:12,756 --> 00:53:14,519
I didn't ask
for any records.

00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:17,754
To receive the monthly main
selection, you do nothing. You...
