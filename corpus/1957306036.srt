1
00:02:59,573 --> 00:03:05,869
We repeat: the flying gimp has been
destroyed, you may return to your homes.

2
00:03:07,052 --> 00:03:10,299
And now, back to the Skye Daley Show.

3
00:03:11,106 --> 00:03:14,055
With the night special guest:
Ricky Coogin.

4
00:03:17,893 --> 00:03:20,301
Ricky, after your hideous
disfigurement,

5
00:03:20,401 --> 00:03:26,447
you're showing incredible courage by
agreeing finally show yourself in public.

6
00:03:26,802 --> 00:03:28,055
Thanks.

7
00:03:28,126 --> 00:03:31,661
America has watched you growing
up in television and in movies.

8
00:03:32,061 --> 00:03:35,276
For years you were everyone's
favorite little brother in that

9
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,568
hit series, The Baker's Dozen.

10
00:03:37,768 --> 00:03:38,768
AWW!

11
00:03:40,484 --> 00:03:45,220
And, of course, as the star of
those hilarious Ghost Dude movies.

12
00:03:46,003 --> 00:03:49,471
You've got the entire
country saying: "Boo, dude!"

13
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:51,501
Boo, dude!

14
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:54,910
But now, after your horrific ordeal,

15
00:03:55,441 --> 00:04:00,237
the very mention of your name makes
children scream in terror.

16
00:04:00,942 --> 00:04:02,681
Ricky Coogin...

17
00:04:04,357 --> 00:04:06,441
the world is waiting to hear your
story.

18
00:04:08,071 --> 00:04:11,149
Well, it's kinda long, but... O.K.

19
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:15,827
It all started when I was approached to be spokesman...

20
00:04:15,827 --> 00:04:18,170
for a multinational corporation called EES.

21
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,378
- Oh, the Everything Except Shoes people.
- Right.

22
00:04:20,378 --> 00:04:23,594
I was at their headquarters
to meet the chairman and the board of directors.

23
00:04:24,095 --> 00:04:25,897
They wanted to send me to South
America,

24
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:29,301
to promote a controversial fertilizer called Zygrot-24.

25
00:04:29,501 --> 00:04:33,997
You are the only one who can stand up
to this radicals, who trying to keep...

26
00:04:34,122 --> 00:04:38,400
Zygrot-24 from the struggling farmers
whose very future depends on it.

27
00:04:38,951 --> 00:04:42,009
-  Wasn't that stuff banned?
- Only in the US...

28
00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:44,209
and Europe.

29
00:04:45,539 --> 00:04:49,000
- I've heard that shit is lethal.
- Alright, you need proof.

30
00:04:49,733 --> 00:04:51,848
Fine. Please, sit down.

31
00:04:53,629 --> 00:04:57,368
I would like you to meet the head of
our South American research facility

32
00:04:57,728 --> 00:04:59,500
senor Juan Valdez.

33
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,395
My name is Jorge Ramirez.

34
00:05:03,418 --> 00:05:08,712
Whatever. He's been working with
Zygrot-24 every day for the last 5 years.

35
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:11,160
And look at him. He's in fine shape.

36
00:05:11,651 --> 00:05:13,040
Aren't you...

37
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,885
Juan?

38
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,669
Yes, I'm fine.

39
00:05:25,848 --> 00:05:29,450
I want you know that Me and my team
in Santa Flan...

40
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:33,738
Santa Flan?! What kinda shitty name for a country is that?

41
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:40,200
It is named for the Patron Saint
of creamy desserts.

42
00:05:41,989 --> 00:05:47,717
As I was saying, we have worked
very closely with Zygrot-24.

43
00:05:48,156 --> 00:05:50,951
I have personally supervised its development.

44
00:05:51,078 --> 00:05:54,041
No potential danger was
left uninvestigated.

45
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:58,143
The environmentalists are crackfucks!
All of them!

46
00:05:58,343 --> 00:06:02,600
It's ridiculous, I tell you. Totally ridiculous!

47
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:05,500
Thank You, Valdez. That'll be all.

48
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,121
- Hey, wait a min...
- Ricky, this is important.

49
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:14,358
We're talking about a major threat to the EES image.

50
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:20,637
How does two million dollars plus expenses sound?

51
00:06:21,767 --> 00:06:24,943
Dick, two million. Sounds great.

52
00:06:26,297 --> 00:06:28,120
- But...
- I hear you.

53
00:06:29,828 --> 00:06:31,655
Let's make it five million.

54
00:06:32,881 --> 00:06:36,136
That is, if the board agrees.
Gentlemen, all those in favor?

55
00:06:37,548 --> 00:06:39,025
Good. It's unanimous.

56
00:06:40,957 --> 00:06:46,181
Well, Ricky, that you say? Are you
EES's man in Santa Flan?

57
00:07:02,627 --> 00:07:04,142
So the deal was done.

58
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,901
I was Ricky Coogin — toxic chemicals
salesman.

59
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:10,870
Me and my buddy Ernie hopped on
the next plane to Santa Flan.

60
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:13,282
- Oh, did show movie?
- Return to the Blue Lagoon.

61
00:07:13,482 --> 00:07:15,287
Oh, I heard that sucked.

62
00:07:15,487 --> 00:07:17,626
Where the hell is Ernie?

63
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Ladies, all wanted was a manicure.

64
00:07:23,413 --> 00:07:26,320
Hey, I'm kidding. What is that, gravy?

65
00:07:29,047 --> 00:07:30,846
Where did you get that?

66
00:07:30,846 --> 00:07:34,886
I don't know, Coog. It started as a pimp,
and that I scratched it.

67
00:07:37,007 --> 00:07:39,877
Can I get you dear two gentlemen a pillow or a blanket?

68
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:41,219
Yes, please.

69
00:07:47,188 --> 00:07:50,500
- Is that your luggage up there?
- Yeah.

70
00:07:50,581 --> 00:07:54,965
- Is that your ugly little troll?
- Stuey Gluck!

71
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,785
Rick!

72
00:07:57,985 --> 00:08:01,957
Look, I got rare still from your
first season on The Baker's Dozen!

73
00:08:02,057 --> 00:08:06,708
Could you sigh it for me? Please!

74
00:08:07,481 --> 00:08:08,792
Baker's Dozen. I liked the
mom on that show.

75
00:08:08,793 --> 00:08:10,200
- I porked her.
- Cool.

76
00:08:17,241 --> 00:08:20,800
Rick, it says here Zygrot-24 is dangerous.

77
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,595
Why're you lending your name to
it, Rick?

78
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:28,460
You used to be good. But now...
I just don't know.

79
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,650
Don't cry, Stuey. Deep down, I'm still good.

80
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:54,000
YES!

81
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,854
May I take your bomb, sir?

82
00:09:11,855 --> 00:09:16,345
Ñaptain Benoway here. To the right of the aircraft,
you can see a terrific view of the Grand Canyon.

83
00:09:16,381 --> 00:09:19,338
And to the left, you can see a
panic-stricken little troll.

84
00:09:29,049 --> 00:09:30,258
- You gonna eat your peanuts, Ernie?
- Nah, you can have 'em.

85
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:31,395
Thanks.

86
00:09:42,732 --> 00:09:44,731
Hey, I'm O.K.

87
00:09:48,432 --> 00:09:50,082
Santa Flan International Airport

88
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:54,260
Here we are, Ernie. Santa Spam. World
famous for loud music and hot sex.

89
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,159
- It is?
- Just give me a few hours.

90
00:09:58,523 --> 00:10:00,683
Sure glad that was not our plane.

91
00:10:00,883 --> 00:10:03,883
EES mustn't stay!
Take your toxic crap away!

92
00:10:16,296 --> 00:10:18,650
Jesus! We'd better find a limo right now,

93
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,645
before this whale-kissers will tear us apart...

94
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,480
I got a better idea.

95
00:10:28,358 --> 00:10:31,270
If I can just find the right disguise.

96
00:10:35,654 --> 00:10:36,931
Take this.

97
00:10:38,486 --> 00:10:42,220
Ow! Give me back my crutches! You monster! Oh, it hurts!

98
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,285
Oh, God!

99
00:10:47,251 --> 00:10:48,622
Are you O.K.?

100
00:10:50,308 --> 00:10:51,630
- Let me help you.
- Thanks.

101
00:10:52,057 --> 00:10:55,733
Don't worry about me. What's one man's pain...

102
00:10:55,744 --> 00:11:00,619
weighed against the global injustice of corporate tyrants like EES?

103
00:11:00,784 --> 00:11:04,330
Go. The fight must continue.

104
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:10,818
- Wow! My name is Julie.
- Josh. Josh Tavner.

105
00:11:11,434 --> 00:11:13,165
Mother Teresa. Glad to meet you.

106
00:11:14,911 --> 00:11:16,787
- Give me that, you ape.
- Ow!

107
00:11:17,494 --> 00:11:22,428
Josh (- Yeah.), a busload of us are headed
over to Maracas to protest Zygrot-24...

108
00:11:22,429 --> 00:11:24,860
and pelt Ricky Coogin with cow shit.

109
00:11:25,548 --> 00:11:28,282
Same here! You could ride with us.

110
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:31,060
Us? You're with him?

111
00:11:31,664 --> 00:11:34,990
Ernie? Oh, he's okay. Have you ever heard of an idiot savant?

112
00:11:34,991 --> 00:11:38,318
- Sure.
- That's Ernie. Except for the savant part.

113
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:49,000
Yeah, well, one thing's for sure.
That Coogin guy sure is an asshole, huh?

114
00:11:49,054 --> 00:11:51,605
I'll say! What a total piece of shit.

115
00:11:51,606 --> 00:11:53,944
I mean, don't you think so, Josh?

116
00:11:54,445 --> 00:11:56,911
Well, he's got a few problems.

117
00:11:56,912 --> 00:12:01,095
And what a lousy actor! I mean, can you believe like "Ghost Dude" crap?

118
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:04,627
Come on, with a script that bad, he deserves
an Oscar for coming off as good as he did!

119
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:07,790
- Well, he's no Christian Slater.
- Slater?!

120
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:11,321
No, come on! I could act circles around that one-note hack!

121
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,755
And you think Slater could improv like this, huh?!

122
00:12:20,665 --> 00:12:22,299
Damn it!

123
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:29,483
So, Julie, do you like Swedish films?

124
00:12:38,152 --> 00:12:41,475
You don't even want to hear the truth
about Zygrot-24, do you, Coogin?

125
00:12:41,479 --> 00:12:45,253
I mean, look, I'm not saying this stuff
is going to turn anyone in some kind of...

126
00:12:45,263 --> 00:12:46,764
Huminwerm?

127
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:49,541
Exatcly, a human worm. I mean, that's just absurd.

128
00:12:49,542 --> 00:12:52,140
- The point is that this product...
- Dawg Boy?

129
00:12:52,141 --> 00:12:55,255
Yes, or a dog boy. That's stupid.

130
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,783
- The point this is very dan...
- Hideous Frawgman?

131
00:12:58,784 --> 00:13:00,710
Okay. Now you're just being silly.

132
00:13:01,395 --> 00:13:03,940
Human suffering's just a big joke to you, isn't it, Coogin?

133
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
- What?
- You are so sick.

134
00:13:08,005 --> 00:13:13,000
Cool! A freak show! Let's check it out!

135
00:13:13,054 --> 00:13:15,800
Kind of like a family reunion for you, huh?

136
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:18,200
Lighten up, Coog, could be a goof.

Welcome to Freekland. Home of nature's
most repulsive mistakes.

141
00:14:21,601 --> 00:14:25,557
Don't forget to visit our snack-bar.
And, please, no spitting.

142
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Isn't it great?

143
00:14:31,294 --> 00:14:35,000
It is so... real.

144
00:14:35,838 --> 00:14:37,320
Real stupid.

145
00:14:44,373 --> 00:14:48,180
- Let's go, Ernie. This place is dead.
- Yeah. Where are all the weirdos?

146
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:52,150
There are no weirdos here!

147
00:14:55,376 --> 00:14:58,430
Mutants? Yes.

148
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:02,700
Genetic nightmares? Definitely.

149
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:10,222
Children of Hell and twisted masses
of living, breathing tormented flesh?

150
00:15:11,022 --> 00:15:12,459
Certainly.

151
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:16,008
But as for weirdos...

152
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,931
not a one.

153
00:15:22,131 --> 00:15:26,930
Unless of course... you count me.

154
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:33,100
Nah, you seem like a regular dumbshit old redneck to me.

155
00:15:35,115 --> 00:15:39,022
- I'm Julie. And you are...
- I'm Elijah C. Skuggs,

156
00:15:39,023 --> 00:15:43,000
proud proprietor of Skugg's Fabulous Freak Land and Mutant Emporium.

157
00:15:43,001 --> 00:15:49,177
But you already knew that. After all,
you've ventured miles away from civilization,

158
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:54,880
hospitals, telephones, polÃ­cia.

159
00:15:56,691 --> 00:16:00,161
- How may I help you?
- Drop dead.

160
00:16:00,802 --> 00:16:03,700
We would love to see your freak show.

161
00:16:03,743 --> 00:16:10,751
You see, you have built a monument to
the variety and... innovation of nature.

162
00:16:13,113 --> 00:16:19,006
It reminds us to respect the fragile and complexity of our global ecosystem.

163
00:16:19,007 --> 00:16:21,590
And you come to me looking for weirdos?

164
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:25,575
Hey. Hey!

165
00:16:33,786 --> 00:16:38,359
- Hello.
- Mr. Toad is... my assistant.

166
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:44,169
As for the show, I'm afraid the next parade
of deformity isn't until tomorrow evening.

167
00:16:44,748 --> 00:16:50,558
However! I do have a private exhibit in my shed...

168
00:16:51,812 --> 00:16:56,555
you might be interested. I don't usually share it with the general public

169
00:16:56,556 --> 00:17:00,839
Well, we're deeply honored. But... no thanks.

170
00:17:01,857 --> 00:17:04,920
Yeah. We really must be... Alright.

171
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,840
I've used to blow up toads with firecrackers, pal! So watch it!

172
00:17:11,843 --> 00:17:15,256
The sideshow tradition has been
completely misrepresented by the media.

173
00:17:15,892 --> 00:17:18,461
I mean, you don't traffic in human misery.

174
00:17:18,461 --> 00:17:21,979
You show society the part of itself it doesn't want to look at.

175
00:17:22,603 --> 00:17:25,410
Yeah, it is.

176
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:28,917
Who the hell, huh? We'll see some pickled dog brains.

177
00:17:29,739 --> 00:17:33,377
Maybe some pictures of women with,
you know, added equipment, huh? Huh?

178
00:17:35,368 --> 00:17:37,106
Why not?

179
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,503
I just love "Family Circus".

180
00:18:01,307 --> 00:18:03,200
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND!?

181
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:07,882
How do they do it? They do use the
same joke over and over again.

182
00:18:07,883 --> 00:18:11,505
I'm just a sucker for that little moffet's shenanigans, that's all.

183
00:18:12,205 --> 00:18:17,611
Perhaps I should tell you a little more about what I do.

184
00:18:18,694 --> 00:18:23,228
You see, I not only exhibit freaks.

185
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:26,854
I make them.

186
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:30,897
Just like Michelangelo saw the angel in the stone,

187
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:35,777
I look can at a guy like Kevin Costner...

188
00:18:36,284 --> 00:18:41,151
and see a giant peach grub who can fart the Blue Danube..

189
00:18:43,495 --> 00:18:49,077
Behold! The Tasty Freekz machine!

190
00:18:50,569 --> 00:18:53,682
My God! He's using Zygrot-24!

191
00:18:53,802 --> 00:18:55,865
Hey! You're not supposed to have that stuff!

192
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,665
Oh? Well, I guess I'm not supposed to have these either!

193
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:03,504
Who wants to get freaked first?

194
00:19:03,514 --> 00:19:04,625
Ladies first.

195
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:07,279
- Go screw yourself!
- If I were you, I would!

196
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,280
Oh, God!

197
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:19,612
What are we gonna with these two? Let's see.

198
00:19:19,812 --> 00:19:20,812
<i>*Inaudible to me</i>

199
00:19:21,248 --> 00:19:26,130
Do we make them deformed? Michael Jackson...

200
00:19:27,889 --> 00:19:32,348
It's like Yin and Yang... AC/DC...

201
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:37,141
two birds with one stone...

202
00:19:37,851 --> 00:19:39,987
Yeah, it's pretty darn good, really...

203
00:19:40,362 --> 00:19:42,931
Let 'er rip, Toad!

204
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:19,739
Wait a second. You're really gonna smear
that stuff on us and mutate our body parts!?

205
00:20:19,739 --> 00:20:24,304
- Correct.
- Well... then could you give me a really big rodney?

206
00:20:24,304 --> 00:20:28,166
I'm a mad scientist pal, not a miracle worker.

207
00:20:43,718 --> 00:20:47,219
Gumby, put that thing away!

208
00:20:53,165 --> 00:20:55,800
Feast your eyes!

209
00:21:02,468 --> 00:21:06,011
Oh well, at least I'll never have to go far for a piece of tail.

210
00:21:06,533 --> 00:21:07,899
Pig!

211
00:21:09,305 --> 00:21:12,725
Toad, take them to their quarters.

212
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:22,576
A mere party trick.

213
00:21:23,826 --> 00:21:29,319
But you, you're gonna be... special.

214
00:22:02,252 --> 00:22:06,455
- Hello?
- Laughing Man? This is Red Swan.

215
00:22:08,485 --> 00:22:11,016
Fine, thank you. And you?

216
00:22:12,058 --> 00:22:15,967
Listen, I have created the ultimate freak, sort of.

217
00:22:17,267 --> 00:22:21,693
Yes. Well, see, that's just he's not quite... finished.

218
00:22:21,893 --> 00:22:26,038
I'm gonna need some more that... Zygrot-24.

219
00:22:31,718 --> 00:22:33,823
Could you... spell it?

220
00:22:39,102 --> 00:22:41,685
Got it.

221
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,791
Yes. Well, you... you take it easy too.

222
00:22:49,423 --> 00:22:51,196
Asshole.

223
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,196
Wakey wakey, eggs and bakey.

224
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:05,098
Time to meet and greet the brand new you.

225
00:23:11,722 --> 00:23:17,000
- Oh God! This was my good side!
- Still is, if you ask me.

226
00:23:17,086 --> 00:23:20,671
Hell. Wait 'til you see what I've
planned for the other side.

227
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:25,002
Welcome to your spacious accommodation.

228
00:23:33,757 --> 00:23:38,786
- Great use of the space.
- Yeah! Yeah. I learned it all from Bob Vila.

229
00:23:39,324 --> 00:23:45,545
You know, you could expose this rustic beams
and put in a skylight over just one weekend, Elijah.

230
00:23:45,555 --> 00:23:47,513
Give it a rest, Bob.

231
00:23:58,306 --> 00:24:00,945
One of these days I gotta put a shitter in there.

232
00:24:01,045 --> 00:24:05,291
No problem, Elijah. It is all right here in
my new book "Bedrooms and Bathrooms ".

233
00:24:05,291 --> 00:24:08,121
In fact, if take this one...

234
00:24:11,189 --> 00:24:16,657
- Ernie? Julie?
- Over here, Coog.

235
00:24:17,643 --> 00:24:20,399
- Are you alright?
- Oh, I know that voice.

236
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,413
That's the voice that said, "Cool, a freak show. Let's check it out "

237
00:24:24,414 --> 00:24:27,900
Oh sure. Blame the woman. Typical.

238
00:24:28,103 --> 00:24:33,575
"It's so real." Is this real enough for you? I'm friggin' Quasimodo!

239
00:24:34,258 --> 00:24:35,642
Lighten up, Coog.

240
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:42,666
You're talking to the original tag team of ugly pukes here. Look at this outfit.

241
00:24:43,541 --> 00:24:49,100
- Come on. Step into the light.
- Okay, here I come.

242
00:24:56,450 --> 00:25:02,132
Oh geez... Well, it's not so revolting.

243
00:25:05,072 --> 00:25:11,250
I mean, after all, physical beauty is a mere socially-enforced myth that...

244
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,955
Oh, shit!

245
00:25:18,201 --> 00:25:23,735
Yeah? Well, you're no Mona Lisas yourself.
You're lucky I've got a strong stomach!

246
00:25:24,084 --> 00:25:26,939
And you're lucky I don't BITE you!

247
00:25:26,939 --> 00:25:30,905
- Get away from me you, you...
- Freak?

248
00:25:32,517 --> 00:25:37,990
I am Ortiz, the Dog Boy. Leader of the freaks.

249
00:25:39,176 --> 00:25:40,591
Kind of like "top dog."

250
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:45,358
Welcome to Hell, Rick. Shake?

251
00:25:45,971 --> 00:25:48,750
No thanks. I don't plan on staying long.

252
00:25:52,933 --> 00:25:54,450
How many of you are there in here anyway?

253
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:58,257
First, I have a question for you, Ricardo.

254
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:05,395
- Who starred in the film "Exorcist II: The Heretic"?
- Ha?

255
00:26:05,524 --> 00:26:09,205
Well, perhaps we should ask the Worm!

256
00:26:10,089 --> 00:26:14,312
Tell us, Worm. Who is starred in
the "Exorcist II: The Heretic"?

257
00:26:14,722 --> 00:26:18,820
- Olivia Newton-John.
- Olivia Newton-John.

258
00:26:19,421 --> 00:26:24,474
- Rick, you agree or disagree?
- This is nuts. This is crazy.

259
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,822
- Besides, it was Linda Blair.
- Very good. It was Linda Blair.

260
00:26:29,827 --> 00:26:32,112
Circle gets the square.

261
00:26:33,019 --> 00:26:34,634
That's cool. That's cool.

262
00:26:34,745 --> 00:26:38,593
Okay, JulieErnie. Who's it going to be?

263
00:26:39,292 --> 00:26:41,351
Nosey the Nose Man!

264
00:26:42,551 --> 00:26:43,800
What?

265
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,270
- Cowboy!
- Howdy.

266
00:26:46,281 --> 00:26:48,865
The Bearded Lady!

267
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,265
How ya' doin.

268
00:26:50,276 --> 00:26:53,109
- Sockhead!
- Hi! Hi.

269
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:57,221
- The Eternal flame!
- Fire in the hole.

270
00:26:57,355 --> 00:27:00,822
Rosie the Pinhead!

271
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:04,523
The hideous Frog Man!

272
00:27:05,816 --> 00:27:10,788
And of course, in the center square, Mr. Paul Lynde!

273
00:27:14,004 --> 00:27:15,168
Who will it be?

274
00:27:15,169 --> 00:27:17,676
Call me old-fashioned, but I'll go with Paul Lynde.

275
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:20,049
- Don't be an idiot.
- It's funny.

276
00:27:24,282 --> 00:27:31,448
You see, Rick? Just because we're freaks
doesn't mean we can't have some fun, huh?

277
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:34,588
Get away from me. Get away!

278
00:27:35,188 --> 00:27:41,663
I'm not like you. You hear me? I'm Ricky Coogin! I AM NOT A FREAK!

279
00:27:52,458 --> 00:27:53,576
FREAK! FREAK!

280
00:28:00,565 --> 00:28:02,536
Poor kid.

281
00:28:06,757 --> 00:28:08,286
Well, sucks.

282
00:28:11,075 --> 00:28:13,608
Wonder if they still castin' Gremlins 3.

283
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:15,800
I'll call my agent in the morning.

284
00:28:17,326 --> 00:28:20,620
Look, Rick. All the freaks have gone through this anguish.

285
00:28:20,621 --> 00:28:23,324
At first, I was blinded by my anger. I admit that.

286
00:28:23,325 --> 00:28:28,179
I wanted to break your neck for getting me into this. But... I got over it.

287
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,091
Ortiz taught me to channel my anger for the common good.

288
00:28:32,291 --> 00:28:34,433
You wanted to see the freak show.

289
00:28:34,533 --> 00:28:36,633
I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU TO SHUT UP!

290
00:28:41,206 --> 00:28:42,235
Ernie!

291
00:28:44,004 --> 00:28:47,689
Sorry, Coog. For a second, I was a total man-hater.

292
00:28:50,074 --> 00:28:52,411
Here. Take it.

293
00:28:53,916 --> 00:28:56,947
"So You're a Hideous Mutant Freak — Now What?"

294
00:28:57,556 --> 00:29:01,634
I don't need this. I'm not like those other god-forsaken animals.

295
00:29:01,635 --> 00:29:04,887
You're mistaken, Rick. You are exactly like us.

296
00:29:05,823 --> 00:29:09,662
We were all normal healthy folk before we made the fateful mistake...

297
00:29:09,663 --> 00:29:11,753
of coming to this hell hole at an off hour.

298
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:16,608
When I first came here, I was a professor of lacrophylogy.

299
00:29:17,208 --> 00:29:19,129
The study of worms, of course.

300
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:22,132
I was on the trail of the fat
pudgy worm.

301
00:29:22,332 --> 00:29:24,795
Mr. Skuggs said he had just such a worm in his shed.

302
00:29:24,895 --> 00:29:29,936
How could I've possibly surmised that the specimen
and myself should ultimately prove to be one and the same?

303
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:36,443
At first, the transformation was fabulous.

304
00:29:36,991 --> 00:29:39,980
I truly understood the worm's ethos like never before.

305
00:29:41,091 --> 00:29:43,195
But those early days of fascination are over.

306
00:29:44,035 --> 00:29:47,195
Now, in retrospect, I think the whole thing is a fucking headache.

307
00:29:48,726 --> 00:29:51,756
I'd sell my soul just to be able to wipe my own ass.

308
00:29:57,382 --> 00:30:00,831
I first came here as a tourist. Looking for some fun.

309
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:01,960
Nice place.

310
00:30:05,292 --> 00:30:07,985
Then Elijah turned me into a sock.

311
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:13,685
I'm sorry. I'm... I'm not much for stories.

312
00:30:17,506 --> 00:30:20,800
When I first arrived here, I was nothing like I am now.

313
00:30:24,745 --> 00:30:29,909
I was confused — a walking contradiction, so full of questions.

314
00:30:30,054 --> 00:30:32,672
You know, you'd be better off without a dick.

315
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,861
Hey, you can keep the beard.

316
00:30:38,911 --> 00:30:40,742
Hallelujah.

317
00:30:41,196 --> 00:30:43,755
But now I know who I am.
I can say it the world:

318
00:30:44,228 --> 00:30:48,773
"Hey. This is me. I'm a woman. And I like me."

319
00:31:09,879 --> 00:31:11,645
Damn, this rough

320
00:31:13,436 --> 00:31:16,240
You're one of us now, Rick. Whether you admit it or not.

321
00:31:17,434 --> 00:31:18,652
It's irrefutable.

322
00:31:30,047 --> 00:31:33,310
- Hey, mind your business.
- Sorry, sorry.

323
00:31:40,151 --> 00:31:42,225
Ortiz, Ortiz, that's me. That's me,
Ortiz.

324
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:45,543
Ortiz! Ortiz! You're on me. Oh! Oh!

325
00:31:45,619 --> 00:31:48,629
I'm not gonna cleaning this up. Ortiz, God damn!

326
00:31:49,155 --> 00:31:51,935
Well that EES guy should rescue me any minute.

327
00:31:52,523 --> 00:31:56,064
Then it's back to sunny old L.A and straight to the plastic surgeon.

328
00:31:56,439 --> 00:32:00,922
I wonder how many of my anatomically
correct girlfriends will be waiting for me.

329
00:32:01,305 --> 00:32:04,543
- I'll be waiting for you, Rick!.
- Thanks, Stuey.

330
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:08,147
Ah! It's a troll!

331
00:32:09,639 --> 00:32:12,137
Get away! Go home. What are you doing here?

332
00:32:12,147 --> 00:32:15,223
Seeing phantom trolls, Rick?

333
00:32:15,805 --> 00:32:16,787
No.

334
00:32:17,073 --> 00:32:20,303
Sounds to me like you've developed a telepathic bond.

335
00:32:20,304 --> 00:32:25,811
Don't mean yer nuts or nuthin'.
Heck, old Nosey, why he can smell the future.

336
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:30,894
Lots of us freaks got E.S.P. And Sockhead, he's got E.S.P.N.

337
00:32:32,495 --> 00:32:35,213
Watch out, Hulk! He's gonna try the skull cracker!

338
00:32:36,284 --> 00:32:38,832
Shucks, Rick, you're lucky.

339
00:32:39,081 --> 00:32:43,074
Telepathy like yours only occurs between real soulmates.

340
00:32:43,466 --> 00:32:45,761
A bond like that should be cherished.

341
00:32:46,096 --> 00:32:48,535
Wow! I'm Ricky Coogin's soulmate!

342
00:32:48,536 --> 00:32:51,417
In your dreams! Now get lost, troll!

343
00:32:51,749 --> 00:32:55,195
Wait'll I tell the kids at school!

344
00:32:55,196 --> 00:32:59,683
Shucks Rick, it don't make sense to spurn your soulmate.

345
00:33:00,274 --> 00:33:04,706
I reckon that troll could help you if you just let him into your heart.

346
00:33:10,758 --> 00:33:12,786
Once America sees what happened to Ricky,

347
00:33:12,787 --> 00:33:16,776
they'll probably send the whole FBI down to save him!

348
00:33:17,778 --> 00:33:22,757
I'll probably win a Pulitzer prize for this scoop. And I'll dedicate it to Rick!

349
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:42,530
Of course I'll print it! America needs to know!

350
00:33:42,531 --> 00:33:45,640
Burt! Give mister Gluck his fee and show him out.

351
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,228
That's okay. I know the way out.

352
00:33:50,972 --> 00:33:55,346
"Freaky Deaky! Ricky Coogin's a mutant in South America!

353
00:33:55,925 --> 00:33:58,899
By Stuart S. Gluck." That's me!

354
00:34:01,455 --> 00:34:04,442
No. You've got it all wrong. I don't know anything about that.

355
00:34:04,443 --> 00:34:06,113
You gotta believe me.

356
00:34:11,601 --> 00:34:17,889
Ladies and gentlemen, get ready
for the glamour! Get ready for the glitz!

357
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:22,330
Get ready to be pelted with rotten vegetables,

358
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:25,995
'cause it's showtime!

359
00:34:34,269 --> 00:34:38,274
I bet you weigh about a... 107.

360
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:42,760
One, two, three ...

361
00:34:57,661 --> 00:35:01,030
What's keeping those damn EES guys?

362
00:35:01,031 --> 00:35:03,550
Something's troubling you, my boy. What is it?

363
00:35:05,018 --> 00:35:06,360
Take a wild guess.

364
00:35:06,361 --> 00:35:09,063
Oh. I think I know what you're going through.

365
00:35:09,064 --> 00:35:12,686
You see, I too had an eating disorder.

366
00:35:17,629 --> 00:35:19,008
Quiet, please.

367
00:35:20,659 --> 00:35:21,659
Thank you.

368
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:25,990
Ladies and gentlemen, tonight

369
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:30,829
you are about to wonder a cavalcade of atrocities so horrific,

370
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,427
I advise the more sensitive members of our audience

371
00:35:34,627 --> 00:35:37,520
to leave the premises at this time.

372
00:35:42,577 --> 00:35:48,959
Tonight, I'm proud to announce
several new and original monstrosities,

373
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,546
including our star attraction, the Beast Boy.

374
00:35:55,089 --> 00:35:58,510
But first, a perennial favorite here at Freekland,

375
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:01,273
Sit back and snuggle up,

376
00:36:01,473 --> 00:36:06,311
for the musical stylings of Rosie the Pinhead!

377
00:36:21,761 --> 00:36:25,755
Sings out dear. From the
diaphragm.

378
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:33,341
Hey, Julie, how many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb?

379
00:36:33,342 --> 00:36:33,973
How many?

380
00:36:34,208 --> 00:36:38,745
Two. One to screw it in and one to ride my Rodney! Ha-ha-ha!

381
00:36:38,833 --> 00:36:39,533
Oaf!

382
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:54,212
If your coloring is in the autumn range, like Maria's,

383
00:36:54,613 --> 00:36:57,244
I would suggest you try an earth tone eye makeup.

384
00:36:57,556 --> 00:37:00,135
As you can see, I've done a lovely French braid on Maria,

385
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:03,847
but I encourage everyone to experiment and use your imagination.

386
00:37:03,848 --> 00:37:06,805
The main thing is to just have fun with it.

387
00:37:13,294 --> 00:37:15,493
Yeah! Check this out! Ha!

388
00:37:18,488 --> 00:37:19,488
What?!

389
00:37:19,688 --> 00:37:20,688
Hey!

390
00:37:21,905 --> 00:37:23,295
Piece of...

391
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:37,419
BREAKFAST, LUNCH, OR DINNER,
IT'S SUCH A TASTY MEAL

392
00:37:37,619 --> 00:37:43,249
WE DO THE WEINERSCHNITZEL POLKA
BECAUSE WE LOVE TO EAT FRIED VEAL

393
00:37:43,449 --> 00:37:44,849
HEY! HEY! HEY!

394
00:37:45,049 --> 00:37:46,049
Thank you!

395
00:37:46,476 --> 00:37:50,216
Thank you! Thank you! You are a great
audience.

396
00:37:54,071 --> 00:37:57,999
- Hey! He's got a hand under there!
- It's a hoax!

397
00:38:06,114 --> 00:38:07,114
Bite me!

398
00:38:07,415 --> 00:38:10,309
Puppeteering is an admirable skill in its own right!

399
00:38:11,452 --> 00:38:12,786
Give him his due!

400
00:38:13,486 --> 00:38:15,705
Beast Boy! Beast Boy!

401
00:38:15,706 --> 00:38:16,964
He'll be out here in a moment!

402
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:21,020
And when I won first prize, they never called me pudding-head again.

403
00:38:21,593 --> 00:38:23,571
- So?
- Don't you see?

404
00:38:23,572 --> 00:38:26,023
You must turn your hardship into inspiration!

405
00:38:26,307 --> 00:38:29,489
You're an actor, Rick! Your body is your instrument.

406
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:33,133
And with it you must play your tragic symphony for all the world!

407
00:38:33,293 --> 00:38:36,919
They're going nuts for you, Beast Boy.
You better go out there now.

408
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,347
I'll be right there.

409
00:38:38,955 --> 00:38:42,166
Thank you, Worm. I don't really know how I can repay you for this.

410
00:38:42,169 --> 00:38:43,727
You could wipe my ass.

411
00:38:44,896 --> 00:38:46,246
What a comedian.

412
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:53,592
Nosey, have I ever told you what a gifted artist you are?

413
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:10,588
Now is the winter of our discontent.

414
00:39:11,503 --> 00:39:14,726
Made glorious summer by the sun of York.

415
00:39:14,831 --> 00:39:17,436
I didn't write that shit. Where is that
crap?

416
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:19,534
But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,

417
00:39:20,535 --> 00:39:23,229
Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;

418
00:39:24,467 --> 00:39:27,867
If you're having trouble understanding

419
00:39:27,868 --> 00:39:31,676
Mr. Coogin's brilliant reading of this soliloquy from Richard the Third,

420
00:39:31,825 --> 00:39:36,443
please take advantage of the handy subtitles for the culturally illiterate.

421
00:39:38,625 --> 00:39:42,383
Deformed, sent before my time

422
00:39:43,741 --> 00:39:47,226
Into this breathing world, scarse half made up,

423
00:39:50,007 --> 00:39:55,669
Why I, in this weak piping time of peace,

424
00:39:55,670 --> 00:40:00,757
Have no delight to pass away the time,

425
00:40:08,303 --> 00:40:09,524
Thank you.

426
00:40:19,592 --> 00:40:21,166
Beautiful!

427
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:24,073
- Thank You. Thank you.
- They seemed to like it.

428
00:40:34,012 --> 00:40:35,657
Oh my god.

429
00:40:38,781 --> 00:40:39,819
Yes!

430
00:40:41,552 --> 00:40:43,515
Thank God for EES!

431
00:40:45,594 --> 00:40:50,696
Yeah, yeah, Rick. Look, I really love this
new look you got going for yourself.

432
00:40:50,697 --> 00:40:54,093
It's fresh, and hip, and kids will love it,

433
00:40:54,094 --> 00:40:58,254
but back in EES, I don't think that
big boys upstairs gonna get it.

434
00:40:59,024 --> 00:41:03,449
- What are you saying?
- Well, Rick, what I'm trying to say is that...

435
00:41:03,644 --> 00:41:09,450
Well... You're ugly enough to burn the nose hairs off a dead nun.

436
00:41:21,209 --> 00:41:22,807
WHAT A PUTZ!

437
00:41:33,316 --> 00:41:35,250
Eat shit!

438
00:41:38,581 --> 00:41:41,540
Rick, now you're just being childish.

439
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:47,920
Run for your lives!

440
00:41:52,548 --> 00:41:55,978
What's the metter? Afraid
of a little rough scuffle?

441
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:59,550
Welcome to show business, morons!

442
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:06,503
You're going to hell!

443
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:20,420
Now that's entertainment.

444
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,120
And now it's time to play

445
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:31,490
Damn lock!

446
00:42:34,061 --> 00:42:35,480
That's against the law.

447
00:42:43,747 --> 00:42:45,671
Psst! Hey, you. Milkman!

448
00:42:46,672 --> 00:42:49,690
- Me?
- Yeah, you. I got something to show you.

449
00:42:51,804 --> 00:42:53,335
Come around to this little trap door.

450
00:42:58,067 --> 00:42:59,135
What is it?

451
00:42:59,335 --> 00:43:02,173
I just laid a turd that is
spitting image of Kim Basinger.

452
00:43:02,175 --> 00:43:04,848
Boy! If I had a dime for everytime I heard that...

453
00:43:04,849 --> 00:43:06,684
- She's naked too.
- Really?

454
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:10,516
This I gotta see.

455
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:21,569
Argh! It's just a regular turd. Kinda like Winona Ryder, but...

456
00:43:41,967 --> 00:43:43,225
Shit!

457
00:43:58,300 --> 00:43:59,600
Damn eyes!

458
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:04,200
Damn lock!

459
00:44:08,376 --> 00:44:09,376
The club!

460
00:44:11,351 --> 00:44:12,600
What the hell?!

461
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:22,651
Stop! In a name of Haile Selassie. Don't move, milkman.

462
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,037
Good work, Eye and Eye.

463
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:28,276
Rastafar-eye.

464
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:33,098
Now sand the Beast Boy to my, uh, den.

465
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:41,027
You will never go out.

466
00:44:53,716 --> 00:44:56,346
- Diet soda?
- No, thanks.

467
00:44:56,381 --> 00:44:58,631
- Fiddle Faddle?
- Alright.

468
00:45:07,238 --> 00:45:10,124
Delicious!

469
00:45:10,125 --> 00:45:13,600
So. Aren't you gonna kill me or something?

470
00:45:14,675 --> 00:45:17,928
Sure, it'd be fun, but the Boy-Beast is a hit.

471
00:45:18,228 --> 00:45:22,157
Look, Elijah, I've been in show business all my life.

472
00:45:22,158 --> 00:45:26,767
The public does not want to see disgusting, depraved, violent filth.

473
00:45:26,769 --> 00:45:30,598
Oh, and I suppose Jake and the Fatman is just a fluke?

474
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:35,120
'Yello?

475
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,917
Listen, I'm all set to roll here.

476
00:45:42,546 --> 00:45:43,880
You got it.

477
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:46,800
Yeap.

478
00:45:47,045 --> 00:45:48,560
Ciao to you too.

479
00:45:50,977 --> 00:45:52,895
Jolly son of a bitch.

480
00:45:53,881 --> 00:45:56,158
We'll see who has the last laugh, you jerkoff.

481
00:45:57,974 --> 00:45:59,600
Alright, Coogin, listen up.

482
00:45:59,801 --> 00:46:03,511
You're gonna be a hideous killing machine.

483
00:46:03,528 --> 00:46:06,518
Tomorrow night I'm gonna finish the job onstage!

484
00:46:06,643 --> 00:46:09,187
And you're gonna slaughter all the old freaks.

485
00:46:09,387 --> 00:46:12,841
And from their ashes, you'll arise...

486
00:46:12,842 --> 00:46:16,259
like the mighty Phoenix, only lot uglier.

487
00:46:16,789 --> 00:46:19,611
And then the whole world will... Hey!

488
00:46:20,641 --> 00:46:22,762
I told you enough!

489
00:46:23,919 --> 00:46:25,957
So Elijah was going to send you to Phoenix?

490
00:46:26,588 --> 00:46:29,444
No, he was talking about a huge bird.

491
00:46:29,445 --> 00:46:32,385
The mystical creature? It's just a
metaphor.

492
00:46:32,599 --> 00:46:33,599
Oh.

493
00:46:34,126 --> 00:46:37,304
The point is Elijah wanted to turn me to
a bloodthirsty monster...

494
00:46:37,305 --> 00:46:39,260
to have me kill all my fellow freaks.

495
00:46:39,261 --> 00:46:42,518
But what he didn't know is that I
left his den with an important clue.

496
00:46:59,727 --> 00:47:01,790
Look, another milkman.

497
00:47:04,075 --> 00:47:07,450
- Hey, Rick, could you come up with your own escape plan?
- Yeah.

498
00:47:07,451 --> 00:47:12,240
You gotta be kidding me. A dozen milkmen? Isn't that a little unusual?

499
00:47:12,591 --> 00:47:15,760
- Twelve milkmen is theoretically possible.
- Yeah.

500
00:47:15,769 --> 00:47:18,446
Thirteen is silly.

501
00:47:19,154 --> 00:47:22,337
Looks like one milkman too many, Coogin.

502
00:47:23,684 --> 00:47:26,723
- Freaks!
- Fine then. Go ahead.

503
00:47:27,659 --> 00:47:30,037
Hope you like reggae, ya flea-bitten bastard.

504
00:47:30,237 --> 00:47:32,013
Be very quiet.

505
00:47:35,542 --> 00:47:37,149
Shit!

506
00:47:37,899 --> 00:47:40,105
Look, you'll all be killed.

507
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:43,679
You don't know about Elijah's giant Rasta eyeballs with machine guns.

508
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,151
Oh boy. He's go off the deep end.

509
00:47:45,602 --> 00:47:48,165
It's suicide! I can't let you do it.

510
00:47:48,166 --> 00:47:51,357
And I can't let you stop us.

511
00:47:54,961 --> 00:47:57,720
Come on, Ortiz. Come on, you little pansy.

512
00:47:58,055 --> 00:48:00,520
Be careful, he's a rabid! He's a rabid dog.

513
00:48:00,521 --> 00:48:03,025
Stick and move! Stick and move!

514
00:48:03,026 --> 00:48:05,307
Really slick. You could really pool his eyes out.

515
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:11,133
Kill him! Sorry.

516
00:48:12,916 --> 00:48:16,162
That's a lot of milkmen on the same route.

517
00:48:16,333 --> 00:48:18,371
No wonder they fight.

518
00:48:18,372 --> 00:48:19,414
Come on!

519
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:32,227
Squirrel!

520
00:48:39,427 --> 00:48:40,527
Rastafar-eye!

521
00:48:40,528 --> 00:48:44,599
Shit! Two giant Rasta eyeballs, just like Rick said.

522
00:48:50,951 --> 00:48:54,365
Gosh, if it wasn't for Rick, we'd all be dead!

523
00:48:54,548 --> 00:48:57,468
- Hey-hey! Thanks!
- Rick is good! Alright!

524
00:48:59,799 --> 00:49:02,583
Come on. You heard the Beast Boy. Back to the Freak House.

525
00:49:02,584 --> 00:49:03,585
Yeah!

526
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:07,500
How!

527
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:09,859
All I wanted was a hug.

528
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:12,782
Maybe I was wrong about you, Coogin.

529
00:49:18,317 --> 00:49:19,317
Not again!

530
00:49:20,811 --> 00:49:23,600
Oh well, at least we'll get to try a new position.

531
00:49:25,222 --> 00:49:26,972
It says it's strong enough for a man!

532
00:49:26,973 --> 00:49:29,532
- But it's made for a woman!
- Give me!

533
00:49:30,338 --> 00:49:33,558
- Hey.
- Rick. What's up?

534
00:49:33,559 --> 00:49:35,941
Read this. I grabbed it from Skuggs' den.

535
00:49:37,235 --> 00:49:42,330
"Buy more Fiddle Faddle. Tape Donahue.
Renew Subscription to Beaver World."

536
00:49:42,331 --> 00:49:44,319
Beaver World? Let me see that.

537
00:49:46,159 --> 00:49:47,159
After that.

538
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:54,139
"Prepare demonstration for Laughing Man,
receive five thousand barrels of Zygrot-24!?"

539
00:49:54,729 --> 00:49:57,965
Elijah's up to something big. We have to stop him.

540
00:49:58,619 --> 00:50:00,636
We're done for! We're done for!

541
00:50:00,637 --> 00:50:06,032
I don't want to die! It's the end of the world! The apocalypse! Aahh!

542
00:50:06,033 --> 00:50:07,575
I haven't said anything yet.

543
00:50:07,576 --> 00:50:10,813
Sorry. I'm not much for timing.

544
00:50:12,322 --> 00:50:18,028
Look, tomorrow night, at the show, I'll
be turned into an evil superfreak.

545
00:50:18,128 --> 00:50:19,808
And forced to kill you all.

546
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:23,237
But we might have a chance if we act fast.

547
00:50:23,632 --> 00:50:27,990
And I'm prepared to be your new leader.

548
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:29,926
I say we kill him.

549
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:33,285
And I've got a plan.

550
00:50:34,085 --> 00:50:35,971
I still say we kill him.

551
00:50:36,506 --> 00:50:39,793
If we can get into Elijah's lab, maybe we can...

552
00:50:39,794 --> 00:50:43,352
Of course! Design a code to turn you to good super freak...

553
00:50:43,353 --> 00:50:46,825
and program it to make you destroy Elijah instead of us!

554
00:50:47,604 --> 00:50:48,635
Brilliant!

555
00:50:48,636 --> 00:50:51,772
- Oh. Well... Actually I was...
- How do we get to the lab?

556
00:50:52,777 --> 00:50:54,885
Right! The worm could dig a tunnel!

557
00:50:55,785 --> 00:50:57,703
By God, it's so crazy it might just work!

558
00:50:57,883 --> 00:51:00,344
But you need Zygrot-24 to make the freak-sludge,

559
00:51:00,345 --> 00:51:02,344
and Elijah told us himself he's run out of it.

560
00:51:02,772 --> 00:51:06,235
- Oh, yeah... Or if we just...
- Yes, exactly!

561
00:51:06,236 --> 00:51:09,150
If they've been using Zygrot-24 as a fertilizer ban,

562
00:51:09,151 --> 00:51:11,500
the entire ecosystem must be soaked with it!

563
00:51:11,501 --> 00:51:15,263
All we need is a way to extract it from
the vegetation, ideally into a liquid form.

564
00:51:15,264 --> 00:51:17,063
- Right.
- Golly!

565
00:51:17,064 --> 00:51:20,523
So that's why my milk comes out that weird blue color!

566
00:51:20,524 --> 00:51:23,133
I thought the grass tasted funny!

567
00:51:23,721 --> 00:51:27,593
Wow, Rick. You're a genius.

568
00:51:27,594 --> 00:51:30,252
- Good thinking, Rick.
- Yeah!

569
00:51:31,644 --> 00:51:34,400
That's cool, Rick. Tell me, how did you ever think of such a plan?

570
00:51:35,606 --> 00:51:40,262
Well, actually, I was going to suggest we send away for sea monkeys.

571
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:42,754
Train them to fire guns, and make a break for it.

572
00:51:43,933 --> 00:51:47,544
But if you... if want to go with this super good freak thing, I...

573
00:51:48,245 --> 00:51:49,626
I guess that's okay.

574
00:51:49,826 --> 00:51:52,600
Freekz! That's What They Call Us!

575
00:52:22,874 --> 00:52:26,025
Hey! Turn off that goddamn music!

576
00:52:30,763 --> 00:52:33,600
Soooryyy!

577
00:52:34,366 --> 00:52:35,957
What a jerk!

578
00:52:50,723 --> 00:52:52,052
I hate it when you do that.

579
00:53:00,748 --> 00:53:03,268
- Hey, look at this.
- What?

580
00:53:09,264 --> 00:53:13,803
Good Lord! It's the Lost City of Nodd!

581
00:53:17,305 --> 00:53:20,058
It's Old Faithful!

582
00:53:23,768 --> 00:53:25,684
Is my aunt Gertie and my uncle Sid.

583
00:53:26,487 --> 00:53:30,470
- It's my Bar Mitzvah.
- C'mon Ernie, let's go.

584
00:53:30,471 --> 00:53:35,451
Wait. Wait. You gotta see that one where rabbi laughed
so hard that noodle pudding came out his nose. It was...

585
00:53:35,452 --> 00:53:36,452
Stooge!

586
00:53:44,024 --> 00:53:45,183
Nice digging, Worm.

587
00:53:48,621 --> 00:53:52,323
Back off, okay? I got a real shot fuse today.

588
00:53:52,325 --> 00:53:56,916
I'm cranky, I'm bloated, and I got a
wicked case of cramps. Don't ask why.

589
00:53:57,442 --> 00:53:58,442
PMS?

590
00:53:59,059 --> 00:54:00,600
Gotcha, freaks!

591
00:54:01,439 --> 00:54:04,238
Ha, fool you! Didn't know I did impressions, did ya?

592
00:54:06,843 --> 00:54:09,135
Hey, guys. Mission accomplished.

593
00:54:09,235 --> 00:54:11,912
They've got the Zygrot-24 and broke in through the lab.

594
00:54:16,635 --> 00:54:20,050
No! Can't you see? We're digging our own grave!

595
00:54:20,051 --> 00:54:22,367
It's nuts, that's what it is! Nuts!

596
00:54:22,448 --> 00:54:25,422
Well, maybe you've all got a deathwish,
but you can count me out!

597
00:54:25,423 --> 00:54:26,943
I'M GETTING THE HELL OUT OF HERE!

598
00:54:36,612 --> 00:54:40,089
Nobody move. Nobody get hurt.

599
00:54:43,964 --> 00:54:45,644
OUT OF MY WAY!

600
00:55:01,885 --> 00:55:03,969
That sock full'a holes, mon.

601
00:55:09,948 --> 00:55:11,407
What a mess.

602
00:55:13,723 --> 00:55:18,589
I... I just wanted to say...

603
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:21,975
What is it, kid?

604
00:55:23,897 --> 00:55:28,689
Ah, forget it. I'm not much for dying.

605
00:55:30,814 --> 00:55:34,541
He's better off this way. It's a blessing.

606
00:55:38,734 --> 00:55:41,132
I've hacked the Elijah's super-freak program.

607
00:55:42,105 --> 00:55:44,102
My god, it's complex.

608
00:55:48,249 --> 00:55:50,275
OK, guys. We got a job to do.

609
00:55:50,287 --> 00:55:52,925
Let's do it and keep quiet, okay?

610
00:56:10,235 --> 00:56:11,535
Oops.

611
00:56:12,235 --> 00:56:15,911
Now, look. From now on, no more screw-ups, okay?

612
00:56:19,647 --> 00:56:21,715
Styrofoam cup?

613
00:56:29,121 --> 00:56:31,275
Here it comes. It's working.

614
00:56:33,726 --> 00:56:35,273
Somebody's coming.

615
00:56:38,983 --> 00:56:40,264
It's plugged up!

616
00:56:40,265 --> 00:56:42,931
If it's your fault, I'll wring your wormy neck.

617
00:56:42,932 --> 00:56:46,849
Preposterous... I have no neck. I'm a worm, imbecile.

618
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:58,957
Aaargh! Damn... buttered popcorn.

619
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:07,995
The tunnel walls are about to collapse!

620
00:57:08,815 --> 00:57:10,634
You go ahead. I'll catch up.

621
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:12,169
- Rick!
- Go!

622
00:57:12,170 --> 00:57:16,189
- Yeah, go. I'll stay here with Rick.
- C'mon.

623
00:57:52,599 --> 00:57:54,845
Bad for the environment.

624
00:58:00,599 --> 00:58:02,565
I think I see him. I see him.

625
00:58:03,556 --> 00:58:04,600
Come on, Rick.

626
00:58:07,318 --> 00:58:08,550
Just made it!

627
00:58:08,797 --> 00:58:11,030
Okay, everybody, listen up.

628
00:58:11,106 --> 00:58:14,012
Now, we cracked the code and made the ointment we need...

629
00:58:14,013 --> 00:58:15,439
to bring Skuggs down for good.

630
00:58:16,792 --> 00:58:19,286
- Finally!
- But I... I left it in the lab.

631
00:58:22,513 --> 00:58:24,466
Wait! Wait! But wait!

632
00:58:25,230 --> 00:58:28,117
I found some macaroons! And there's plenty for all of us!

633
00:58:31,192 --> 00:58:33,394
I hate macaroons.

634
00:59:00,159 --> 00:59:03,109
EES is in bed with Elijah C. Skuggs.

635
00:59:07,984 --> 00:59:08,984
Damn!

636
00:59:10,588 --> 00:59:14,357
Nice to see you in the flesh, Laughing Man.

637
00:59:15,634 --> 00:59:19,647
I think we can dispense with the
codenames, Elijah. We're all friends here.

638
00:59:21,399 --> 00:59:23,526
And to prove it, we brought you a little present.

639
00:59:27,941 --> 00:59:30,532
- Rick? Is that you?
- Who's the troll?

640
00:59:30,533 --> 00:59:33,535
He was asking questions about Coogin, causing trouble.

641
00:59:33,536 --> 00:59:34,590
We figured he was one of yours.

642
00:59:34,591 --> 00:59:39,590
Well I make freaks alright, but...
come on, fellas, this thing's pathetic.

643
00:59:39,591 --> 00:59:43,153
Well you're no Julio Iglesias yourself, mister!

644
00:59:44,523 --> 00:59:47,405
Rick!

645
00:59:48,190 --> 00:59:50,162
Oh, no! Not now, Stuey!

646
00:59:51,434 --> 00:59:53,638
Hey, where are you?

647
00:59:54,208 --> 00:59:57,654
I'm in the lab! I'm in the lab! I'm in the lab!

648
00:59:58,292 --> 01:00:01,133
Not only ugly, he's crazy too.

649
01:00:01,833 --> 01:00:04,179
Toad. Get away.

650
01:00:17,366 --> 01:00:20,645
Gentlemen, I'm not going to bullshit you.

651
01:00:21,890 --> 01:00:26,440
I know my setup here at Freakland looks like small potatoes.

652
01:00:27,184 --> 01:00:30,390
But thanks to your Zygrot-24 and my genius,

653
01:00:30,391 --> 01:00:33,828
tonight I will turn Ricky Coogin into a freak so hideous,

654
01:00:33,829 --> 01:00:36,450
it'll be enough to make your stomach turn inside out.

655
01:00:36,451 --> 01:00:38,810
He'll boil your brain in its own juices,

656
01:00:38,811 --> 01:00:42,830
and cause cold sores you thought had
healed up to start buggin' you again.

657
01:00:44,650 --> 01:00:48,913
It's the dawning of a new age. A new beginning.

658
01:00:50,509 --> 01:00:52,013
Behold...

659
01:00:52,590 --> 01:00:57,118
Super Mega Freak World!

660
01:01:00,032 --> 01:01:01,545
It's really somethin', huh?

661
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:06,120
Very impressive.

662
01:01:07,591 --> 01:01:10,516
We'll kick Disney's dead ass!

663
01:01:11,062 --> 01:01:13,776
Stuey! Stuey, can you hear me?

664
01:01:15,063 --> 01:01:16,672
I want you to try and escape.

665
01:01:16,682 --> 01:01:19,099
Earn me the can on the floor near the <i>*blast burnished*</i>.

666
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:22,631
I like your spirit, Skuggs. But
Disney, c'mon!

667
01:01:23,531 --> 01:01:26,044
- I like "Bambi".
- "Bambi" is suck.

668
01:01:26,048 --> 01:01:27,802
What about part where mother get shot?

669
01:01:27,803 --> 01:01:31,565
- Yeah. Yeah, I liked that part.
- I like it too.

670
01:01:36,912 --> 01:01:41,498
We here a EES have plans for your
Gene Machine and include everything.

671
01:01:42,261 --> 01:01:44,559
Well, everything except shoes, of course.

672
01:01:48,169 --> 01:01:50,448
Well, I'd love to see your plans.

673
01:01:51,151 --> 01:01:53,171
I'd love to show it to you.

674
01:01:53,652 --> 01:01:55,662
Bill, would you do the honors?

675
01:02:08,563 --> 01:02:11,445
What does today's businessman want?

676
01:02:12,250 --> 01:02:13,250
Well...

677
01:02:14,414 --> 01:02:19,027
How about a receptionist with six arms,
three mouths, and a knockout figure?

678
01:02:19,871 --> 01:02:23,901
That would sure speed things up. Or job at the factory?

679
01:02:23,902 --> 01:02:28,732
How do we fight the rising problem of
sagging productivity from lazy workers?

680
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:34,072
How about a worker with twelve
busy hands, no mouth to talk back,

681
01:02:34,073 --> 01:02:37,881
no genitalia or gastrointestinal system
to distract him from his work?

682
01:02:38,183 --> 01:02:41,150
Sure! It's what we all dream about, isn't it?

683
01:02:42,327 --> 01:02:45,550
Well, with this Skuggs-based Zygrot technology,

684
01:02:45,551 --> 01:02:49,092
these thing are not only possible,
they are only the beginning.

685
01:02:50,216 --> 01:02:55,083
We are poised on the edge of a new
frontier, limited only by our imagination.

686
01:02:56,175 --> 01:03:00,380
Of course, what happened to our expensive spokesman Ricky Coogin

687
01:03:00,381 --> 01:03:02,273
was an unfortunate coincidence.

688
01:03:02,450 --> 01:03:08,195
On the other hand, profits from these new markets could total in the billions.

689
01:03:09,140 --> 01:03:10,189
Ricky who?

690
01:03:14,298 --> 01:03:16,089
Hey! Hold on!

691
01:03:16,594 --> 01:03:22,714
Secretaries? Worker drones? Where's the fun? Where's the spark?

692
01:03:23,594 --> 01:03:25,842
Where's the unspeakable evil?

693
01:03:25,885 --> 01:03:30,120
I was just getting to that.
We're gonna impact every field.

694
01:03:30,121 --> 01:03:33,225
Cosmetics, military, household pets.

695
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:35,424
And why should we stop at consumer products?

696
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:37,907
Hell, we can design awhole new consumer!

697
01:03:37,908 --> 01:03:41,201
A few well placed drops in the water supply, and bingo!

698
01:03:41,870 --> 01:03:46,062
It's a whole new master race, and we own the copyright!

699
01:03:46,388 --> 01:03:50,637
- This guy is good.
- We lured him away from Pepsi.

700
01:03:50,938 --> 01:03:53,162
Right here! Right now!

701
01:03:53,163 --> 01:03:59,164
We are building a better tomorrow for
those who uphold the vision of EES!

702
01:03:59,494 --> 01:04:01,478
Bill, if I can just add one thing.

703
01:04:02,967 --> 01:04:08,262
Those who dare oppose us, will stand
knee deep in the blood of their children.

704
01:04:21,257 --> 01:04:25,291
And now the moment you've all been waiting for, ladies and gentlemen.

705
01:04:25,992 --> 01:04:29,030
The Beast Boy!

706
01:04:34,010 --> 01:04:35,010
<i>Rick!</i>

707
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:38,585
<i>- Over here, Rick.
- Where?</i>

708
01:04:38,592 --> 01:04:42,078
With this remarkable ointment of my own design,

709
01:04:42,550 --> 01:04:46,163
I'm going to transform this half-finished ghoul...

710
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:52,975
into the ultimate stomach-turning super freak, dedicated to evil!

711
01:04:53,995 --> 01:04:55,095
<i>Here I am, Rick.</i>

712
01:04:55,264 --> 01:04:57,580
Goddammit, kid! Would you sit down!?

713
01:05:01,627 --> 01:05:04,797
- Oh, no!
- Oh, shit! Move down.

714
01:05:07,234 --> 01:05:08,540
What the hell!?

715
01:05:11,021 --> 01:05:13,133
You got a problem, mister?

716
01:05:23,956 --> 01:05:26,800
YOUR ASS IS MINE, SKUGGS!

717
01:05:26,801 --> 01:05:28,435
This kid looks pissed.

718
01:05:30,517 --> 01:05:32,454
EYE AND EYE! KILL HIM!

719
01:05:42,158 --> 01:05:44,172
Damn my eyes!

720
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:45,493
Toad!

721
01:05:48,552 --> 01:05:50,944
Ooh, I'm shaking!

722
01:05:59,581 --> 01:06:01,167
Shit!

723
01:06:06,999 --> 01:06:10,015
Aaaah! I'm in a zoo!

724
01:06:13,966 --> 01:06:16,131
Looks like it's time to bring out the big gun.

725
01:06:16,998 --> 01:06:19,227
- Sayonara, kiddo.
- No!

726
01:06:23,638 --> 01:06:24,741
Rick!

727
01:06:33,021 --> 01:06:36,897
What a waste of twelve bucks.
Let's get the machine and go.

728
01:06:37,854 --> 01:06:40,465
- Come on.
- Right now!

729
01:06:40,968 --> 01:06:43,220
Wait. Wait. Could you sign this first?

730
01:06:43,221 --> 01:06:45,210
Time to die, troll.

731
01:06:46,271 --> 01:06:48,269
FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!

732
01:06:48,270 --> 01:06:50,181
Let's go, dickhead!

733
01:06:50,182 --> 01:06:52,818
FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!

734
01:06:55,218 --> 01:06:56,218
FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!

735
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:06,845
Give him the skull cracker, ya big goon!

736
01:07:06,847 --> 01:07:09,115
No way! The skull cracker is an illegal move!

737
01:07:10,425 --> 01:07:12,600
Yeaah, I am the number one!

738
01:07:14,820 --> 01:07:19,831
- I betting my bar-mitzvah money!
- Let's get this over with. Hey, Dick...

739
01:07:24,865 --> 01:07:26,127
What the hell are you doing?

740
01:07:27,207 --> 01:07:31,917
This machine is the property of the Everything Except Shoes Corporation.

741
01:07:31,918 --> 01:07:34,694
- What?!
- Eat shit, yokel.

742
01:07:38,977 --> 01:07:42,400
I knew I couldn't trust you corporate greaseballs!

743
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:49,099
Move is that thing!

744
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:52,650
Eat this, Dick.

745
01:07:57,618 --> 01:08:00,879
Head for the hills before he gets all of us!

746
01:08:04,795 --> 01:08:10,250
Boy, I haven't seen a stampede like this since the opening night of Ishtar!

747
01:08:19,170 --> 01:08:21,925
NOW I RIP FREAKS TO PIECES!

748
01:08:22,197 --> 01:08:25,330
Kill Nosey! You always hated Nosey!

749
01:08:31,142 --> 01:08:34,913
Please! Rick, no! Rick, please!

750
01:08:44,134 --> 01:08:47,173
Now that's a really big shoe.

751
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:57,639
Would you kill him, please?

752
01:08:58,935 --> 01:09:01,431
Kill him! Kill him! KILL HIM!

753
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:03,619
- Then, just as I...
- Sorry to interrupt you, Rick...

754
01:09:03,620 --> 01:09:05,515
but you've been talking for almost ninety minutes,

755
01:09:05,516 --> 01:09:07,744
and we really have got to go to a commercial.

756
01:09:08,162 --> 01:09:09,882
Oh, sorry.

757
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:13,864
<i>You like cheese. You like being a man.</i>

758
01:09:14,341 --> 01:09:16,611
<i>That's why you like...</i>

759
01:09:16,812 --> 01:09:20,385
<i>Macheesemo. Real cheese for real men.</i>

760
01:09:20,386 --> 01:09:22,565
<i>Now in a handy aluminum dispenser.</i>

761
01:09:24,983 --> 01:09:29,937
And now back to the exciting conclusion of Ricky Coogin's incredible story.

762
01:09:30,739 --> 01:09:33,293
Let's see... It seemed like nothing could stop me

763
01:09:33,294 --> 01:09:35,632
from shoving a spear through Stuey's skull.

764
01:09:36,093 --> 01:09:39,224
<i>- When all of a sudden, I heard a voice.
- No!</i>

765
01:09:39,225 --> 01:09:43,869
<i>I reckon that troll could help you if you just let him into your heart...</i>

766
01:09:43,870 --> 01:09:47,705
<i>your heart... your heart...</i>

767
01:09:47,706 --> 01:09:52,885
your heart... your heart...

768
01:09:58,133 --> 01:10:01,940
I love you.

769
01:10:04,634 --> 01:10:07,890
- You did it, Rick.
- Atta' boy Coog!

770
01:10:10,713 --> 01:10:13,977
Tosh. Sentimental claptrap.

771
01:10:20,435 --> 01:10:24,492
Beast-Boy, I gave you an order and you better obey it, damn it!

772
01:10:24,493 --> 01:10:28,441
- It's over, Skuggs.
- You were nothing before I find you!

773
01:10:28,738 --> 01:10:32,612
I made you. And I can break you!

774
01:10:33,217 --> 01:10:35,029
You think I made you strong? Ha!

775
01:10:35,530 --> 01:10:39,653
I've cranked my DNA up so high, you won't know what hit you.

776
01:10:39,662 --> 01:10:41,581
I'm a wrecking machine!

777
01:11:04,735 --> 01:11:06,919
I think you crushed my spinal cord.

778
01:11:08,572 --> 01:11:12,776
- I can't feel anything in my fingers.
- Maybe you'll feel this.

779
01:11:12,777 --> 01:11:14,114
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

780
01:11:14,115 --> 01:11:17,932
If you kill me, you'll never find the antidote.

781
01:11:18,641 --> 01:11:20,026
What antidote?

782
01:11:21,872 --> 01:11:28,767
A time release serum, I baked it into a delicious batch of macaroons.

783
01:11:29,681 --> 01:11:32,200
- Macaroons?!
- Nice!

784
01:11:33,650 --> 01:11:36,238
If you ask me, you skimped on the coconut!

785
01:12:00,888 --> 01:12:02,481
Freeze, FBI!

786
01:12:05,392 --> 01:12:07,349
Looks like they took care of Skuggs, chief.

787
01:12:07,350 --> 01:12:08,729
Nice work, Ricky.

788
01:12:09,975 --> 01:12:12,160
You'll get a medal from the Vice President for this.

789
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:13,880
Great. But how did you...

790
01:12:13,980 --> 01:12:15,879
We've been following Skuggs for years.

791
01:12:16,817 --> 01:12:21,000
Then when we saw Mr. Gluck's article, we know it's time to move.

792
01:12:21,089 --> 01:12:22,368
So what's took you so long?

793
01:12:22,442 --> 01:12:23,357
First there was a...

794
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:26,671
satan's child thing on page 3.

795
01:12:28,073 --> 01:12:32,100
Then there was the case of the house
that dripped blood.

796
01:12:35,998 --> 01:12:37,600
Look at that thing!

797
01:12:38,009 --> 01:12:39,275
Holy shit!

798
01:12:39,475 --> 01:12:41,209
That's can't be.

799
01:12:42,579 --> 01:12:44,760
What the hell are you looking at?

800
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:46,423
Dead meat!

801
01:12:51,385 --> 01:12:53,325
That's my story.

802
01:12:54,544 --> 01:12:56,021
Oh, it's so exciting.

803
01:12:56,995 --> 01:12:58,583
We fixed Coogin's light!

804
01:12:58,783 --> 01:13:01,559
Oh, it's about time! Turn it on.

805
01:13:03,198 --> 01:13:04,941
- That's better.
- I'll say.

806
01:13:05,212 --> 01:13:09,600
How 'bout it, folks? Let's hear it for Ricky Coogin and his freaky friends!

807
01:13:09,717 --> 01:13:11,498
Bearded Lady!

808
01:13:14,283 --> 01:13:14,936
How ya doin'?

809
01:13:14,945 --> 01:13:18,251
Rosie! The Eternal flame!

810
01:13:18,852 --> 01:13:20,987
Lights out, baby!

811
01:13:20,989 --> 01:13:25,082
Cowboy! Frog-Man! Nosey!

812
01:13:25,282 --> 01:13:28,382
Boo! Get off! Get off!

813
01:13:29,875 --> 01:13:31,275
And the Worm.

814
01:13:32,141 --> 01:13:35,647
Ridiculous. Just because a man doesn't like macaroons.

815
01:13:43,405 --> 01:13:45,963
Gotcha! Damn, it's about time!

816
01:13:46,054 --> 01:13:47,649
Ortiz!

817
01:13:47,650 --> 01:13:50,350
Hey, hermanos!

818
01:13:52,876 --> 01:13:57,702
That's just great. What a story.
And what an ending!

819
01:13:57,703 --> 01:14:01,477
Elijah transformed by the goop! And he actually looked like...

820
01:14:01,478 --> 01:14:05,134
Exactly like you, Skye, I swear. Same face, same outfit.

821
01:14:05,505 --> 01:14:07,572
Except he had these really big, hideous feet.

822
01:14:11,606 --> 01:14:15,264
I'm gonna drink your blood!

823
01:14:22,651 --> 01:14:24,500
Oh, Rick. It's finally over!

824
01:14:24,501 --> 01:14:26,495
Yes... Yes it is.

825
01:14:27,762 --> 01:14:30,675
Rick! Hey, Rick!

826
01:14:31,175 --> 01:14:33,525
Stuey!

827
01:14:40,554 --> 01:14:42,853
Oh, like that wasn't totally predictable.

828
01:14:44,914 --> 01:14:48,423
- Well, now it really is over.
- Thank God.

829
01:14:48,945 --> 01:14:51,994
You know, this whole thing has taught me something.

830
01:14:52,933 --> 01:14:57,547
That when man starts impinging on the subtle perfection of the earth's natural order,

831
01:14:58,564 --> 01:15:01,652
the only thing he'll create is havoc.

832
01:15:01,745 --> 01:15:04,849
Right, Coog. I learned somethin' too.

833
01:15:05,552 --> 01:15:08,174
That men and women truly are equals.

834
01:15:08,635 --> 01:15:12,552
Human spirit transcends
gender and physical appearance.

835
01:15:12,605 --> 01:15:17,252
And thus it is immune to the petty degradations men may devise.

836
01:15:17,253 --> 01:15:20,896
- So true.
- I believe it was Moliere...
- Oh, shut up!

837
01:15:27,918 --> 01:15:29,310
Good night, everybody!

838
01:15:29,710 --> 01:15:31,417
Good night!

839
01:15:36,583 --> 01:15:40,617
