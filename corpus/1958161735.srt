2
00:01:07,516 --> 00:01:09,850
Let's do things differently this time.

3
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:12,039
<i>So</i> differently.

4
00:01:14,588 --> 00:01:16,835
His name is Miles Morales.

5
00:01:18,777 --> 00:01:21,563
He was bitten by a radioactive spider,

6
00:01:22,943 --> 00:01:24,930
and he's not the only one.

7
00:01:29,769 --> 00:01:31,389
He hasn't always had it easy.

8
00:01:40,085 --> 00:01:41,785
And he's not the only one.

9
00:01:47,417 --> 00:01:48,750
And now he's on his own.

10
00:01:54,752 --> 00:01:56,398
And he's not the only one.

11
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:00,023
You think you know the rest.

12
00:02:04,265 --> 00:02:05,231
You don't.

13
00:02:07,205 --> 00:02:09,492
I thought <i>I</i> knew the rest, but...

14
00:02:11,192 --> 00:02:11,985
I didn't.

15
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:15,111
I didn't wanna hurt him.

16
00:02:17,702 --> 00:02:18,728
But I did.

17
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:23,462
And he's not the only one.

18
00:02:33,258 --> 00:02:34,251
-Hey!

19
00:02:34,276 --> 00:02:35,431
Stealth Leopard!

20
00:02:38,205 --> 00:02:38,885
-Gwen!

21
00:02:43,112 --> 00:02:44,112
Is the song over?

22
00:02:44,778 --> 00:02:45,598
[Gwen] Seems over.

23
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,577
-Are you okay?
-Dude, you don't hang out,

24
00:02:47,602 --> 00:02:50,835
-and you don't wanna talk...
-I didn't join a band so I could talk about my feelings!

25
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,720
-Well, I did.
-I joined it so I could hit my feelings with sticks!

26
00:02:54,581 --> 00:02:56,968
-Yo, if you don't tell someone what's going on...

27
00:02:56,993 --> 00:02:58,356
-you're gonna snap.
-<i>I'm fine.</i>

28
00:02:58,381 --> 00:03:00,934
-That's not how someone who's "fine" would say that.
-You say,

29
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,175
"I'm great, thanks!

30
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,229
-How are you?"
-[sarcastically] I'm great!

31
00:03:03,254 --> 00:03:04,589
-Thanks!
-Whoa.

32
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:06,257
How are you?

33
00:03:06,785 --> 00:03:07,498
Fine...?

34
00:03:08,365 --> 00:03:09,752
Gwen, come on.

35
00:03:09,777 --> 00:03:10,791
I don't get you, man.

36
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:11,712
You're right!

37
00:03:12,904 --> 00:03:13,864
I play drums.

38
00:03:16,271 --> 00:03:18,191
[Gwen] I always wanted to be in a band.

39
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:21,699
Guess I just never found the right one.

40
00:03:23,063 --> 00:03:24,537
In this line of work,

41
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,697
You always find out the solo act.

42
00:03:30,279 --> 00:03:31,626
But before Miles,

43
00:03:31,651 --> 00:03:33,399
-[past Gwen] What-? How many of these did you take?
-[present Gwen] ...there was Peter.

44
00:03:33,424 --> 00:03:35,078
I think they look great, I dunno.

45
00:03:35,103 --> 00:03:37,677
Is this...that...dangerous mask?

46
00:03:37,702 --> 00:03:39,577
I don't know, I...she seems like a good guy.

47
00:03:39,602 --> 00:03:41,339
Why wear a mask if you've got nothing to hide?

48
00:03:41,364 --> 00:03:43,366
Alright, no politics at the dinner table.

49
00:03:43,684 --> 00:03:45,204
Thank you, May.

50
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:47,733
But they didn't really know me.

51
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:51,179
And I didn't really know him, either.

52
00:03:52,426 --> 00:03:53,639
Touch him again, Ned.

53
00:03:53,664 --> 00:03:54,559
[Peter] Gwen, it's okay.

54
00:03:56,656 --> 00:03:58,049
...Until it was too late.

55
00:03:59,302 --> 00:03:59,996
[grunts]

56
00:04:05,087 --> 00:04:06,620
-Hey, Gwen!
-Hey!

57
00:04:08,635 --> 00:04:09,548
Peter?

58
00:04:15,642 --> 00:04:16,455
[screaming]

59
00:04:32,748 --> 00:04:33,590
What?

60
00:04:33,615 --> 00:04:34,202
No...!

61
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:38,292
-No, no! No, no, no, no...what did you do?

62
00:04:39,185 --> 00:04:42,159
I just...wanted to be special.

63
00:04:42,955 --> 00:04:43,863
-Like you...

64
00:04:44,604 --> 00:04:45,457
Gwen.

65
00:04:47,017 --> 00:04:47,716
Gwen...?

66
00:04:47,741 --> 00:04:48,117
-Don't worry.

67
00:04:48,824 --> 00:04:50,171
Who's Gwen?

68
00:04:51,801 --> 00:04:53,828
Everything's gonna be okay.

69
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,067
-Don't...don't go!
-Everything's gonna be okay...

70
00:04:59,871 --> 00:05:00,738
Oh, Peter...

71
00:05:10,804 --> 00:05:11,705
Hey, hey!

72
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:13,205
Hey!

73
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,198
Peter...?

74
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:20,016
I never really made another friend, after that.

75
00:05:24,906 --> 00:05:25,919
Except one.

76
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:29,374
But he's not here.

77
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,856
And there's no way to get there.

78
00:05:33,881 --> 00:05:35,865

80
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,351
And why won't she show her face?!

81
00:05:40,376 --> 00:05:43,959
-Peter Parker, an innocent young man...[fading]
-I've known May and Ben Parker for twelve years.

82
00:05:43,984 --> 00:05:46,085
Peter Parker ate at my table.

83
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,918
He was my daughter's <i>best friend.</i>

84
00:05:48,943 --> 00:05:53,405
And I will not rest until I find this Spiderwoman.

85
00:06:05,688 --> 00:06:07,231
[George] Oh! Hey, hey, hey, hey.

86
00:06:07,256 --> 00:06:07,996
How's the band?

87
00:06:08,021 --> 00:06:11,708
[stilted] Uhh...uh, yeah, great. Uh, I quit, so...you know.

88
00:06:11,733 --> 00:06:12,585
Thumbs up.

89
00:06:16,033 --> 00:06:18,553
We, uh...we caught a break in the Spiderwoman case.

90
00:06:19,353 --> 00:06:19,953
Oh.

91
00:06:20,804 --> 00:06:21,984
That's...good.

92
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:23,219
We're close.

93
00:06:23,244 --> 00:06:24,485
I'm telling ya, I can feel it.

94
00:06:25,108 --> 00:06:25,903
[Gwen clears throat]

95
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:26,948
...Me, too.

96
00:06:28,579 --> 00:06:29,899
It'll be good for us.

97
00:06:29,924 --> 00:06:30,919
Don't be so sure.

98
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:33,383
She killed your friend.

99
00:06:33,408 --> 00:06:34,210
You don't know that.

100
00:06:34,235 --> 00:06:35,596
What do you mean I don't know that? I <i>do</i> know that.

101
00:06:35,621 --> 00:06:36,610
Y'know--I was there.

102
00:06:36,635 --> 00:06:38,925
-She ran from the scene...
-Maybe she didn't have a choice.

103
00:06:39,413 --> 00:06:40,826
I've got a job to do, Gwen.

104
00:06:40,851 --> 00:06:42,485
It won't bring him back!

105
00:06:47,119 --> 00:06:49,825
Uh...I don't wanna argue about this.

106
00:06:50,235 --> 00:06:51,215
Okay?

107
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:53,026
Yeah. I can tell.

108
00:06:58,796 --> 00:06:59,662
Say, uh...

00:07:01,808 --> 00:07:03,862

-So...I, uh...

I'll see you later?

[exhales] Cool.

Explain to me how a guy with a 40 foot wingspan

127
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:27,140
just waltzed into the Guggenheim unnoticed?

I am the Vulture, the pinnacle of man's genius!

00:20:54,344 --> 00:20:55,510
Just make a hole...

362
00:20:57,016 --> 00:20:57,896
grab the money.

363
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:03,477
Oh! That's not right.

364
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:05,690
Just get the-...ugh...

365
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:06,632
[grunts]

366
00:21:06,657 --> 00:21:07,943
[awkwardly] Give me your money.

367
00:21:07,968 --> 00:21:09,409
Where are you, money? Where are you?

368
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:10,414
[exclaims]

369
00:21:10,439 --> 00:21:11,393
Oh...

370
00:21:11,418 --> 00:21:13,482
[groaning]

371
00:21:14,444 --> 00:21:14,910
[muffled whistling]

372
00:21:14,935 --> 00:21:15,470
Whoa!

373
00:21:16,084 --> 00:21:17,910
-Hey, who left this ATM on the sidewalk?!
-[Spot] Augh!

374
00:21:17,935 --> 00:21:19,135
[grunting]

375
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,833
Yo, what you doing back there, man?

376
00:21:22,858 --> 00:21:23,336
-Nothing!

377
00:21:23,361 --> 00:21:25,651
Nothing, everything is--everything's cool, man!

378
00:21:25,676 --> 00:21:26,272
All good!

379
00:21:26,297 --> 00:21:27,777
-Just forgot my pin number!
-Get your butt out of here!

380
00:21:27,802 --> 00:21:28,816
-Ahh! No!
-Get your butt out of here!

381
00:21:28,841 --> 00:21:30,792
Sir, please! Just let me rob you!

382
00:21:30,817 --> 00:21:34,096
-[cashier] I'm going to rob your [unintelligible] face!
-[Spot] There's no reason to bring wood into this!

383
00:21:34,121 --> 00:21:35,745
I've never robbed anybody in my life,
[microwave beeping]

384
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:37,105
please don't make this a bad experience for me!
[microwave beeping]

385
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,296
-[cashier] Bad experience?
-[microwave humming]

386
00:21:38,321 --> 00:21:39,743
-I'm trying to run a business, here!

387
00:21:39,768 --> 00:21:40,411
[Spot] I have this whole-[whoosh]

388
00:21:41,164 --> 00:21:42,218
Oh, wow. Is this curry powder?

389
00:21:42,243 --> 00:21:43,308
We'll say I'm a scientist.

390
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:44,220
I <i>was.</i> I am!

391
00:21:44,245 --> 00:21:44,813
-[Spot] I...anyway.
-[cashier shouting]

392
00:21:44,838 --> 00:21:46,226
-[Spot] You heard of Alchemax? I used to-
-[microwave beeps]

393
00:21:46,251 --> 00:21:47,594
[casually] I used to work there.

394
00:21:47,619 --> 00:21:50,508
-[Spot] I was actually considered handsome, by scientist standards.
-[cashier grunting]

395
00:21:50,533 --> 00:21:52,261
But I had a little accident...!

396
00:21:52,286 --> 00:21:54,678
[Spot grunting]

397
00:21:55,411 --> 00:21:56,141
[grunts]

398
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:56,633
Hey!

399
00:21:56,658 --> 00:21:57,561
<i>Oof!</i>

400
00:21:57,772 --> 00:21:58,798
-[Spot] I'm so sorry!

401
00:21:58,823 --> 00:22:00,172
First of all, I'm not even robbing <i>you,</i>

402
00:22:00,197 --> 00:22:02,409
I mean, this ATM machine doesn't even belong to <i>you,</i> right?

403
00:22:02,434 --> 00:22:03,270
This belongs to the bank!

404
00:22:03,295 --> 00:22:05,841
-[Spot] They're the real criminals!
-[cashier] <i>You're</i> the real criminal! You're robbing <i>me!</i>

405
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:08,282
Y'know, I can't really get a job anywhere anymore,

406
00:22:08,307 --> 00:22:10,305
being like <i>this,</i> so I've turned to a life of crime,

407
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,645
-[Spot] ...I'm having trouble finding...ah!
-[Miles] Why do people say "ATM machine"?

408
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:13,468
Who said that?

409
00:22:13,493 --> 00:22:15,495
The <i>M</i> stands for "machines".

410
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,845
Spider--<i>aahh!</i>

411
00:22:18,434 --> 00:22:19,394
[groaning]

412
00:22:20,334 --> 00:22:22,933
-Hey, Lenny. How much do I owe you for this beef patty, man?
-[Spot groaning indistinctly]

413
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:26,220
Spider, if you catch him, it's on the house, brother.

414
00:22:26,245 --> 00:22:27,078
Oww!

415
00:22:27,103 --> 00:22:28,590
Oh! Spiderman. Wow.

416
00:22:28,615 --> 00:22:29,329
[crash] Ahh!

417
00:22:29,354 --> 00:22:30,323
This is real!

418
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:33,427
So, are you like, a cow, or a dalmation?

419
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:34,306
I am...

420
00:22:34,331 --> 00:22:36,620
[music swells dramatically]

421
00:22:36,645 --> 00:22:37,260
The Spot.

422
00:22:37,285 --> 00:22:38,160
[laughing]

423
00:22:38,185 --> 00:22:39,780
We meet again, Spiderman.

424
00:22:39,805 --> 00:22:42,834
[Miles laughing]

425
00:22:42,859 --> 00:22:44,565
-Oh, that's funny to you?
-Of course not.

426
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:45,305
No.

427
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:46,306
So, is that a costume?

428
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:48,502
Unfortunately for both of us, this is skin.

429
00:22:48,527 --> 00:22:49,462
Oh, dang.

430
00:22:49,487 --> 00:22:50,838
You see...
[music swells dramatically]

431
00:22:51,288 --> 00:22:52,342
I'm from your past.

432
00:22:52,968 --> 00:22:53,857
One year ago...
[phone notification]

433
00:22:53,882 --> 00:22:54,711
Hold up.

434
00:22:54,736 --> 00:22:55,549
Oh, come on!

435
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:56,443
[Miles] Uh oh.

436
00:22:56,468 --> 00:22:58,119
-Well, this has been fun, um...
-Who are you talking to?

437
00:22:58,144 --> 00:23:00,574
-But I really gotta wrap this up.
-[politely] No, no, no! No, go ahead, take your call.

438
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:01,181
[screams]

439
00:23:02,754 --> 00:23:05,881
[muffled] This job is so dumb sometimes!

440
00:23:05,906 --> 00:23:08,591
[muffled groaning]

441
00:23:08,918 --> 00:23:10,165
Maybe just pay me now.

442
00:23:10,314 --> 00:23:12,275
[Miles] Okay, let's do this one last time.

443
00:23:13,318 --> 00:23:15,218
My name is Miles Morales.

444
00:23:15,606 --> 00:23:17,479
I was bitten by a radioactive spider,

445
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,850
and for the last year and four months,

446
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:23,880
I've been Brooklyn's one and only Spiderman.

447
00:23:23,905 --> 00:23:26,342
And things are going great.

448
00:23:26,635 --> 00:23:28,022
-[Miles] Hey, hey, hey, hey!
-[screaming, crashing]

449
00:23:28,047 --> 00:23:29,759
-Whoo!
-You could hurt somebody!

450
00:23:32,146 --> 00:23:33,952
[Miles] Catching all sorts of bad guys,

451
00:23:36,287 --> 00:23:36,602
[Miles grunts]

452
00:23:36,627 --> 00:23:39,622
Can't you just act like a regular supervillain so I can catch you?

453
00:23:39,647 --> 00:23:40,989
[screaming uncomfortably]

454
00:23:41,014 --> 00:23:42,407
I designed my new suit,

455
00:23:42,432 --> 00:23:44,893
with some fly ambience down the side.

456
00:23:44,918 --> 00:23:46,539
Aunt May moved to Florida,

457
00:23:46,564 --> 00:23:47,303
[Miles] Done.

458
00:23:47,328 --> 00:23:48,917
I guest hosted Jeopardy.

459
00:23:49,283 --> 00:23:50,923
Endorsed baby powder,

460
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:53,667
apologized for endorsing baby powder,

461
00:23:53,981 --> 00:23:55,614
my mustache came in,

462
00:23:55,884 --> 00:23:57,297
[deep voice] <i>Mustache</i>.

463
00:23:57,322 --> 00:23:59,357
-[bystanders laughing]
-[Miles] ...and out.

464
00:24:00,613 --> 00:24:02,995
Been developing a new twist on my venom thing.

465
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:03,913
<i>Zap!</i>

466
00:24:04,893 --> 00:24:05,953
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

467
00:24:08,506 --> 00:24:08,953
-[Miles] Sorry!

468
00:24:08,978 --> 00:24:12,635
-How much longer can I keep lying about who really I am?
-[Jameson talking indistinctly about Spiderman]

469
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,269
I hear that new Spiderman is Puerto Rican.

470
00:24:14,294 --> 00:24:15,850
[awkward laughing] Nahh, he...

471
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:17,498
he seems more Dominican to me.

472
00:24:17,523 --> 00:24:20,784
-I mean, would they get it if I told them?

473
00:24:20,809 --> 00:24:22,711
[both] We love you and accept you,

474
00:24:22,736 --> 00:24:25,980
even though you have been lying to us for a year!

475
00:24:27,441 --> 00:24:28,874
Maybe in some other universe.

476
00:24:29,602 --> 00:24:31,249
Sometimes I just...

477
00:24:31,274 --> 00:24:32,842
wish I wasn't the only one.

478
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,500
I don't dwell on it.

479
00:24:42,835 --> 00:24:44,622
I miss my uncle, sometimes.

480
00:24:45,794 --> 00:24:47,907
Miles, I see exactly what you're doing here.

481
00:24:49,072 --> 00:24:51,552
Even though he...turned out to be the Prowler.

482
00:24:53,997 --> 00:24:55,677
I try to do what he told me.

483
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,517
Just keep going.

484
00:24:59,167 --> 00:25:00,514
-[Spot] You're looking at your texts?

485
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:02,651
-You understand this is the fight of our lives, right?
-Sorry, sorry.

486
00:25:02,676 --> 00:25:03,765
-Just--just a second.
-Oh, okay.

487
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:05,542
No, no, no. No, go ahead. Take one call.

488
00:25:05,567 --> 00:25:08,201
-You turn off your phone at a movie theater, but you don't turn it off when you're fighting me?
-One sec.

489
00:25:08,772 --> 00:25:09,758
-[Jeff] Ah! "In a minute".

490
00:25:09,783 --> 00:25:11,842
Ahh, he wrote it all as one word.

491
00:25:11,867 --> 00:25:13,744
That's cute, right? Youth.

492
00:25:17,605 --> 00:25:19,438
Ohhh, my nose!

493
00:25:19,465 --> 00:25:20,474
-Sorry, I just-
-[Spot crying]

494
00:25:20,499 --> 00:25:21,411
I really gotta be somewhere-

495
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:22,128
-Sike.
-[Miles screams]

496
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:24,111
[Screaming]

497
00:25:24,136 --> 00:25:24,711
[tapping]

498
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:26,629
[Jeff] Heh. There's bubbles now. Hold on.

499
00:25:26,654 --> 00:25:27,300
Whoa!

500
00:25:28,114 --> 00:25:30,096
[Spot shouting] ...I think this is going great!

501
00:25:30,121 --> 00:25:30,774
[Miles screams]

502
00:25:31,066 --> 00:25:32,760
-[Miles and Spot screaming]
-...Still bubbles on here.

503
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:35,612
You know, I think it's probably okay.

504
00:25:36,732 --> 00:25:37,245
[squawk]

505
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:39,687
[Spot] We're figuring it out! We're finding our rhythm!

506
00:25:42,176 --> 00:25:45,130
I've been waiting for this moment for a really long time, so...

507
00:25:45,155 --> 00:25:46,168
[swan squawking]

508
00:25:46,193 --> 00:25:47,689
-[Spot] Hey, where'd the goose come from?

509
00:25:48,632 --> 00:25:49,250
-Whoa!

510
00:25:49,275 --> 00:25:51,204
I don't think I want this costume anymore.

511
00:25:51,229 --> 00:25:54,571
-Almost there, Mami...smiley face...
-[Spot grunting]

512
00:25:54,596 --> 00:25:56,557
Great. Is this your goose?

513
00:25:56,592 --> 00:25:58,245
Get it off me, get it off me, get it--[grunts]

514
00:26:00,541 --> 00:26:01,294
Ow!

515
00:26:02,781 --> 00:26:03,921
-[Miles] At the end of the day,

516
00:26:05,544 --> 00:26:07,064
[Spot] I got you right where I-

517
00:26:07,089 --> 00:26:07,647
<i>ow!</i>

518
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:09,327
[Spot grunting]

519
00:26:09,352 --> 00:26:10,584
-I'm Spiderman.

520
00:26:10,609 --> 00:26:13,391
-No one can take that away from me.
-Unbelievable.

521
00:26:13,416 --> 00:26:14,790
Come back here, nemesis!

522
00:26:14,815 --> 00:26:16,087
Don't escape!

523
00:26:16,112 --> 00:26:18,200
Your costume's too tight in the back, by the way!

524
00:26:27,062 --> 00:26:28,048
Yo, what's up, man?

525
00:26:28,073 --> 00:26:29,324
Umm, writing an essay.

526
00:26:29,349 --> 00:26:32,462
There's a bad guy on the roof of the Peterson building. Can you call the police?

527
00:26:32,487 --> 00:26:34,941
-Tell them to pick him up?
-I dunno. Sounds like a slippery slope.

528
00:26:34,966 --> 00:26:35,755
Just this one time?

529
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:39,427
It <i>starts</i> with one call, then it's walkie talkies and synchronized watches...

530
00:26:39,452 --> 00:26:40,968
in a month, it'll be a spider signal...

531
00:26:40,993 --> 00:26:42,854
[muffled] I'm not your guy in the chair.

532
00:26:42,879 --> 00:26:44,315
Are those my Jordans?

533
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:46,751
I can't help it if we're the same size.

534
00:26:47,524 --> 00:26:49,070
[bell ringing]

535
00:26:58,302 --> 00:27:01,609
-[counselor] You see, every person is a universe.

536
00:27:01,634 --> 00:27:05,110
And my job is to capture your person's universe

537
00:27:05,135 --> 00:27:06,850
on this piece of paper.

538
00:27:08,387 --> 00:27:09,107
That's blank.

539
00:27:09,132 --> 00:27:09,891
-[counselor] Exactly.

540
00:27:10,443 --> 00:27:13,421
I have no idea who this kid is.

541
00:27:13,446 --> 00:27:15,296
I don't know if <i>he</i> knows.

542
00:27:15,321 --> 00:27:19,141
And he's gotta decide if he's gonna commit himself to his future,
[bell ringing]

543
00:27:19,166 --> 00:27:22,314
-[muffled] ...or whatever he's doing instead of being here.

544
00:27:22,339 --> 00:27:24,273
Can't have your cake and eat it, too.

545
00:27:24,298 --> 00:27:25,588
Unless you bake two cakes!

546
00:27:25,613 --> 00:27:26,362
Rio: Miles?
Jeff: <i>Miles!</i>

547
00:27:26,387 --> 00:27:27,854
[flatly] Interest in comedy.

548
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:28,457
How's this going?

549
00:27:28,482 --> 00:27:30,358
-Now, son, what have we always said?
-College! Woo-woo!

550
00:27:30,383 --> 00:27:32,672
[all] On time means five minutes early.

551
00:27:32,697 --> 00:27:34,391
I know! I know, I know, I know. Look.

552
00:27:34,416 --> 00:27:37,446
I gotta get back to being a great student, so can we make this quick?

553
00:27:40,985 --> 00:27:41,811
-[counselor] Okay.

554
00:27:42,237 --> 00:27:44,130
Miles' grades are pretty good.

555
00:27:44,155 --> 00:27:45,862
A in AP physics,

556
00:27:45,887 --> 00:27:47,168
That's my little man!

557
00:27:47,193 --> 00:27:49,159
and AP studio art,

558
00:27:49,184 --> 00:27:50,725
[chuckles] He takes after his uncle.

559
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,019
-A- in English,

560
00:27:52,044 --> 00:27:52,720
He's a tough grader.

561
00:27:52,745 --> 00:27:54,252
And a B in Spanish.

562
00:27:54,277 --> 00:27:55,734
-What?!
-Whoo, okay.

563
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:57,634
-<i>Miles.</i> [Speaking Spanish]
-Are you trying to kill your mother?!

564
00:27:57,659 --> 00:27:58,829
<i>Calmate, Mami.</i>

565
00:27:58,854 --> 00:28:00,156
<i>Eso no es</i> my fault!

566
00:28:00,181 --> 00:28:01,947
[speaking Spanish] ..."my fault"?

567
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:03,171
[speaking Spanish] ...Spanglish!

568
00:28:03,196 --> 00:28:04,690
Mom, I just missed a few classes!

569
00:28:04,715 --> 00:28:06,828
Oh, just a few classes. Well, what's "a few"?

570
00:28:06,853 --> 00:28:08,492
-[casually] I mean, you know, like...

571
00:28:09,189 --> 00:28:09,736
...five?

572
00:28:09,761 --> 00:28:10,631
<i>Five?!</i>

573
00:28:10,994 --> 00:28:11,860
[counselor] Actually, six.

574
00:28:11,885 --> 00:28:12,530
You're dead.

575
00:28:12,555 --> 00:28:13,304
-Mom.
-[Jeff mutters]

576
00:28:13,329 --> 00:28:14,913
-[sighs] He takes after his uncle.
-Wait, wait, wait. But...

577
00:28:14,938 --> 00:28:15,490
But I...

578
00:28:15,515 --> 00:28:17,064
-I just have a lot going on.
-Alright.

579
00:28:17,089 --> 00:28:18,835
We can still salvage this.

580
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:19,651
I'm sorry, "salvage"?

581
00:28:19,676 --> 00:28:21,884
Miles has a great story to tell.

582
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:24,267
Having a story at all seems gross.

583
00:28:24,292 --> 00:28:26,621
Your name is <i>Miles Morales.</i>

584
00:28:26,646 --> 00:28:27,115
Correct.

585
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:30,169
You grew up in a struggling immigrant family.

586
00:28:30,194 --> 00:28:32,710
I'm from Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico's part of America...

587
00:28:32,735 --> 00:28:35,424
We own a fort in Brooklyn. I-I don't know about <i>struggling</i>...

588
00:28:35,449 --> 00:28:37,522
-[Jeff muttering]
-It doesn't matter. You're all struggling.

589
00:28:37,547 --> 00:28:38,381
[quietly] I'll be captain next week.

590
00:28:38,406 --> 00:28:42,280
And now, his dream is to attend the top physics program in the nation!

591
00:28:42,305 --> 00:28:43,862
Whatever it takes, we'll do it!

592
00:28:43,887 --> 00:28:46,249
At <i>Princeton University.</i>

593
00:28:46,995 --> 00:28:48,222
In <i>New Jersey?!</i>

594
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:51,150
No, no, no no no no! That's too far!

595
00:28:51,175 --> 00:28:53,766
New Jersey's too far from New York?!

596
00:28:53,791 --> 00:28:56,088
There's great schools in Brooklyn!

597
00:28:56,463 --> 00:28:59,010
Princeton has the best quantum researchers in the country!

598
00:28:59,035 --> 00:29:02,790
-[muttering] ...Quantum research...mm-hmm.
-They're moving electrons across dimensional thresholds!

599
00:29:02,815 --> 00:29:03,477
...Electrons, uh-huh.

600
00:29:03,502 --> 00:29:05,117
I mean, they're studying dark matter!

601
00:29:05,142 --> 00:29:06,917
Yeah, I don't know what any of that means.

602
00:29:06,942 --> 00:29:10,256
I could help figure out how to travel to other dimensions.

603
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:11,051
[laughing skeptically] Yeah, okay.

604
00:29:11,076 --> 00:29:13,311
Oh, yeah. That sounds like a really good fake job.

605
00:29:13,336 --> 00:29:15,184
Dad. When you were my age,

606
00:29:15,209 --> 00:29:18,568
you followed <i>your dream,</i> and went out on <i>your own,</i>

607
00:29:18,593 --> 00:29:20,360
to start a business with Uncle Aaron.

608
00:29:20,385 --> 00:29:22,041
-Right?
-That's...different.

609
00:29:22,066 --> 00:29:24,181
We used to...see, when you were born,

610
00:29:24,206 --> 00:29:26,001
[laughs] plus your mom used to...

611
00:29:27,064 --> 00:29:28,664
[firmly] Look, life is a journey.

612
00:29:28,689 --> 00:29:32,208
You all got me into this school 'cuz you thought I could do something special.

613
00:29:33,507 --> 00:29:35,260
And now, I think so, too.

614
00:29:35,636 --> 00:29:37,990
And the special thing I wanna do is this.

615
00:29:38,998 --> 00:29:43,218
There are people out there who can literally teach me the things I wanna learn.

616
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,653
But they aren't all in Brooklyn.

617
00:29:53,601 --> 00:29:54,188
[thud]

618
00:29:54,848 --> 00:29:56,268
That's your story!

619
00:29:56,822 --> 00:29:59,668
-[counselor] Now, just stick to the script.
-[ringing]
-[Jeff muffled] Miles, you okay?

620
00:29:59,693 --> 00:30:01,962
-[indistinct]

621
00:30:05,406 --> 00:30:06,893
-Ooh, I gotta go.
-You...

622
00:30:06,918 --> 00:30:08,278
You guys just keep talking!

623
00:30:08,303 --> 00:30:09,832
-This is all great stuff!
-Miles, wait!

624
00:30:09,857 --> 00:30:11,179
Did you order the cake for tonight?

625
00:30:11,204 --> 00:30:12,706
Yeah, totally! I'm--you know, call me! Uhh-

626
00:30:12,731 --> 00:30:14,136
I gotta go. Alright? Uhh--bye!

627
00:30:15,111 --> 00:30:16,118
This kid.

628
00:30:16,143 --> 00:30:17,477
I swear. What are we gonna do with him?

629
00:30:17,502 --> 00:30:18,526
[radio clicks] <i>All units,</i>

630
00:30:18,551 --> 00:30:20,081
-<i>supervillain event over on...</i>
-I-I gotta go.

631
00:30:20,106 --> 00:30:20,655
What?!

632
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,504
You're gonna leave, too-?

633
00:30:21,529 --> 00:30:22,684
You leave--everybody leaves.

634
00:30:22,709 --> 00:30:23,950
[stammering] Why am I here?

635
00:30:23,975 --> 00:30:25,322
-Why am I here? Why am I still here?
-I know. I'm so sorry.

636
00:30:25,347 --> 00:30:26,437
-But we'll figure it out.

637
00:30:27,437 --> 00:30:28,157
Together.

638
00:30:30,103 --> 00:30:30,823
Wow.

639
00:30:31,145 --> 00:30:33,290
Excuse me. I-I'm so sorry.

640
00:30:33,315 --> 00:30:34,631
-He's lying to you.

641
00:30:34,656 --> 00:30:35,358
Jeff?

642
00:30:35,383 --> 00:30:36,251
-Your son.

643
00:30:36,638 --> 00:30:39,432
He's lying. And I think you know it.

644
00:30:41,687 --> 00:30:42,902
How's your essay?

645
00:30:42,927 --> 00:30:43,758
Marinating.

646
00:30:43,783 --> 00:30:45,243
This is part of my process.

647
00:30:45,268 --> 00:30:46,308
Oh. Oh, really?

648
00:30:46,333 --> 00:30:47,838
[laughs] I think your guy got away.

649
00:30:47,863 --> 00:30:48,628
Thanks. I'm on it.

650
00:30:48,653 --> 00:30:50,069
-Yeah, you seem really stressed.

651
00:30:50,094 --> 00:30:50,575
I agree!

652
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,734
-You're stretched too thin. I've been worried-
-Yeah, alright. Thanks for the tip!

653
00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:53,424
-[Spot] C'mere!
-[Miles screams]

654
00:30:53,449 --> 00:30:54,826
-That was bad.
-[Jeff] I know.

655
00:30:54,851 --> 00:30:56,440
What is really going on with this kid?

656
00:30:56,465 --> 00:30:57,289
I don't know!

657
00:30:57,314 --> 00:30:58,190
[crash]
Hey!

658
00:30:58,822 --> 00:31:00,336
-Spiderman!
-Officer Morales!

659
00:31:00,361 --> 00:31:01,468
I mean, umm...

660
00:31:01,493 --> 00:31:02,508
[deep voice] Officer Morales.

661
00:31:02,533 --> 00:31:03,638
[Spot] This is not what it looks like.

662
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:05,457
Hey! Hey!

663
00:31:05,482 --> 00:31:07,815
-Officer...! [grunts]
-My kid goes here, man!

664
00:31:08,662 --> 00:31:09,128
Yo!

665
00:31:09,282 --> 00:31:10,496
I'm on the PTA!

666
00:31:10,521 --> 00:31:12,586
You know how many lemon bars I gotta bake for that?

667
00:31:12,611 --> 00:31:14,117
[Spot] Who laughs in the middle of a fight?

668
00:31:14,142 --> 00:31:14,817
I did not!

669
00:31:14,842 --> 00:31:17,818
-[Miles] It was...
-[Jeff] Are you serious?!
-[Spot] It was inconsiderate and super rude!

670
00:31:17,843 --> 00:31:18,862
...And a little cocky--oof!

671
00:31:19,134 --> 00:31:21,634
[Jeff] Yeah, you got me agreeing with the bad guy right now.

672
00:31:21,659 --> 00:31:24,296
Bad guy? He's barely a villain of the week!

673
00:31:24,321 --> 00:31:25,202
What'd you call me?

674
00:31:25,227 --> 00:31:27,123
-You realize I'm right here.
-C'mon, man!
-Everything-

675
00:31:27,148 --> 00:31:27,563
[Jeff screams]

676
00:31:28,763 --> 00:31:29,983
[Miles] ...is under control!

677
00:31:36,259 --> 00:31:37,686
Of course we'd end up back here.

678
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:40,007
-[Jeff] Well, you know what? You are just like my son!

679
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:43,231
-I am? I--[laughs] That's so silly! I--what?

680
00:31:43,256 --> 00:31:45,556
-<i>Imagine that.</i>
-Back...where it all...

681
00:31:45,581 --> 00:31:46,660
-started!
-Watch out!

682
00:31:49,122 --> 00:31:51,222
-[Spot] The crucible of our connection!

683
00:31:52,258 --> 00:31:54,497
-[Miles] Hey, don't try to wow me with big words.

684
00:31:54,522 --> 00:31:56,294
-I do the crossword every day.

[music resumes]
-[Spot] Is it all coming back to you?
-What are you talking about?

688
00:32:04,894 --> 00:32:06,426
The creation event!

689
00:32:07,111 --> 00:32:07,797
What?

690
00:32:08,633 --> 00:32:09,824
[phone ringing]

691
00:32:09,849 --> 00:32:10,456
Ah!

692
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,074
Yeah?

693
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:13,159

[Screams]

697
00:32:21,196 --> 00:32:22,669
Yeah, I'm kinda in the middle of something.

698

[Spot grunts]

699
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:25,753
Destiny brought us here!

700
00:32:25,778 --> 00:32:27,425
You see now, don't you?

701
00:32:27,722 --> 00:32:28,856
[deep voice] I-I really don't.

702
00:32:28,881 --> 00:32:30,591
I <i>am</i> your nemesis.

703
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:32,328
You're not my nemesis.

704
00:32:32,353 --> 00:32:33,557
[sing-song] You missed!

705
00:32:33,582 --> 00:32:35,428
-Can't contain the Spot--augh!

706
00:32:35,834 --> 00:32:38,382
You really don't remember what you did to me?

707
00:32:38,828 --> 00:32:39,742
-What I did for <i>you?</i>

708
00:32:39,767 --> 00:32:40,673
Uhhh...

709
00:32:40,698 --> 00:32:41,184
No.

710
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:42,606
I worked at Alchemax.

711
00:32:42,631 --> 00:32:45,155
I ran a test on this collider

712
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:47,750
that brought a spider here from another dimension.

713
00:32:48,634 --> 00:32:50,346
-[Octavius] 42.
-[Spot] Its home dimension...

714
00:32:50,854 --> 00:32:51,820
It escaped.

715
00:32:52,697 --> 00:32:53,957
And it bit <i>you.</i>

716
00:32:54,785 --> 00:32:57,665
My spider made you Spiderman!

717
00:32:58,389 --> 00:32:58,991
What?

718
00:32:59,016 --> 00:33:00,509
You ran through the cafeteria.

719
00:33:00,534 --> 00:33:01,146
He took a bagel!

720
00:33:01,171 --> 00:33:02,499
You hit me with a bagel!

721
00:33:03,036 --> 00:33:04,089
[screaming in pain]

722
00:33:04,114 --> 00:33:06,823
I've hit a lot of different villains with a lot of different food!

723
00:33:06,848 --> 00:33:10,097
You make your flippy, little sassy jokes,

724
00:33:10,122 --> 00:33:11,472
and everyone loves them.

725
00:33:11,962 --> 00:33:13,948
-But no one knows what it feels like...

726
00:33:14,762 --> 00:33:16,309
to be on the other side of them.

727
00:33:16,334 --> 00:33:17,913
I'm just trying to lighten the mood, y'know...?

728
00:33:17,938 --> 00:33:19,039
I created you!

729
00:33:19,579 --> 00:33:21,105
And you created me.

730
00:33:21,725 --> 00:33:22,839
Spiderman, why did you create that guy?

731
00:33:22,864 --> 00:33:23,830
I-I didn't!

732
00:33:23,855 --> 00:33:24,975
He's talking crazy!

733
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,701
I was in this collider room when you <i>blew it up!</i>

734
00:33:34,116 --> 00:33:36,620
[screaming]

735
00:33:36,645 --> 00:33:37,634
-Because of you,

736
00:33:38,619 --> 00:33:40,415
I lost my job,

737
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,426
my life...

738
00:33:42,013 --> 00:33:43,326
my <i>face!</i>

739
00:33:43,351 --> 00:33:45,568
-[crowd laughing]
-My family won't even look at me!

740
00:33:45,593 --> 00:33:47,300
I made you into a hero!

741
00:33:47,637 --> 00:33:48,784
You made me into <i>this!</i>

742
00:33:49,372 --> 00:33:50,423
[distorted] <i>Look at me!</i>

743
00:33:50,448 --> 00:33:52,822
You did this to me!

744
00:33:52,847 --> 00:33:54,060
Look at me!

745
00:33:54,085 --> 00:33:55,747
I'll make you respect me!

746
00:33:55,772 --> 00:33:57,389
<i>Yaah! Ahh! Ow!</i>

747
00:33:57,805 --> 00:33:58,878
[grunting]

748
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,313
[screaming] I am your...

749
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:02,056
[fading] nemesis...!

750
00:34:02,299 --> 00:34:05,005
[Miles panting]

751
00:34:06,129 --> 00:34:07,082
Well, what...

752
00:34:07,107 --> 00:34:07,823
where'd he go?

753
00:34:07,848 --> 00:34:10,273
He...kicked his own butt.

754
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,873
You know we're supposed to <i>catch</i> 'em, the bad guys. Right?

755
00:34:13,898 --> 00:34:15,382
I always do!

756
00:34:16,184 --> 00:34:17,144
...Usually.

757
00:34:17,373 --> 00:34:19,167
Gutierrez, get the crane, man!

758
00:34:19,192 --> 00:34:22,430
-Yes, sir!
-[groaning] Ohh, this here is why nobody likes us, man.

759
00:34:22,455 --> 00:34:23,357
Us...?

760
00:34:23,382 --> 00:34:25,462
I am <i>trying</i> to do right out here.

761
00:34:25,487 --> 00:34:26,800
I mean...I'm trying, too-!

762
00:34:26,825 --> 00:34:29,225
-And you need to be a better role model.
-I'm a great role model!

763
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:33,412
[siren] [crashing]

764
00:34:33,673 --> 00:34:34,633
Hey, Gutierrez.

765
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:36,333
You can cancel the crane.

766
00:34:38,931 --> 00:34:41,405
I swear...[muttering]

767
00:34:41,668 --> 00:34:43,108
Uhhh...

768
00:34:43,133 --> 00:34:45,197
Do you wanna talk about it...?

769
00:34:45,221 --> 00:34:46,295
Are you crazy?!

770
00:34:46,641 --> 00:34:49,761
Well, men of your generation ignore their mental health too much.

771
00:34:49,786 --> 00:34:51,321
-[Jeff laughing]

772
00:34:51,346 --> 00:34:53,364
[shakily] What am I--what am I even doing?

773
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:55,875
'Cuz no matter what I do, someone always thinks I'm blowing it.

774
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:59,176
I know the feeling.

775
00:35:01,536 --> 00:35:04,290
So...your son!

776
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:05,804
How's he doing?

777
00:35:05,829 --> 00:35:08,817
-You think he's gonna figure it all out?
-[Jeff sighs]

778
00:35:09,124 --> 00:35:10,179
Honestly?

779
00:35:10,204 --> 00:35:11,437
[hesitantly] ...Yeah...

780
00:35:11,462 --> 00:35:12,417
He's a good kid...

781
00:35:12,442 --> 00:35:12,910
[excitedly] Yeah?

782
00:35:12,935 --> 00:35:15,701
Y'know, it's scary. He says these things that are so smart,

783
00:35:15,726 --> 00:35:17,594
-Cool! Well, I should probably-

784
00:35:17,619 --> 00:35:20,790
...and he does these things that are so <i>stupid.</i>

785
00:35:21,876 --> 00:35:23,749
[sighs] I just don't want him to mess it up.

786
00:35:24,716 --> 00:35:26,230
[muttering] Maybe get off the kid's ass.

787
00:35:26,255 --> 00:35:26,653
I'm sorry, <i>what?</i>

788
00:35:26,678 --> 00:35:28,785
What? What--I...I don't know!

789
00:35:29,781 --> 00:35:32,241
And I hate that he's not being honest with me!

790
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:34,178
Maybe he's scared to talk to you.

791
00:35:34,203 --> 00:35:36,510
[loudly] Why would anyone be scared to talk to me?!

792
00:35:36,811 --> 00:35:38,657
[stammering] Uhh...I don't--I don't know.

793
00:35:38,682 --> 00:35:39,742
It's just...

794
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:42,197
you're getting pretty good at being a parent, you think...

795
00:35:42,632 --> 00:35:43,632
you got it lit.

796
00:35:44,363 --> 00:35:45,583
And then they go and grow up.

797
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:50,816
I just don't wanna lose him. Y'know?

798
00:35:58,361 --> 00:35:59,701
Well...

799
00:35:59,726 --> 00:36:02,985
as an objective observer with no skin in the game,

800
00:36:03,936 --> 00:36:04,882
I say...

801
00:36:05,787 --> 00:36:07,707
you gotta let him spread his wings, man.

802
00:36:08,717 --> 00:36:09,807
Like this.

803
00:36:10,245 --> 00:36:11,121
...Yeah.

804
00:36:12,798 --> 00:36:14,192
[Jeff laughs] I don't know.

805
00:36:18,398 --> 00:36:21,032
If this isn't nice...what is?

806
00:36:27,542 --> 00:36:28,582
I should go.

807
00:36:29,831 --> 00:36:32,157
Yeah, and--and catch that holes guy.

808
00:36:32,182 --> 00:36:33,445
Don't worry.

809
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:35,539
I don't think that guy's gonna show his face again.

810
00:36:36,589 --> 00:36:37,349
What?

811
00:36:38,394 --> 00:36:39,114
Okay...

812
00:36:41,064 --> 00:36:42,594
I think I kicked myself...

813
00:36:43,419 --> 00:36:44,479
...into myself.

814
00:36:46,706 --> 00:36:47,973
Well, this is new.

815
00:36:48,437 --> 00:36:49,857
Helloooo...!

816
00:36:49,882 --> 00:36:51,701
Hello! Echo, echo, echo--no echo.

Hypothesis:

818
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:56,846
I'm going to put my head in that hole.

823
00:37:08,371 --> 00:37:09,331
That was...

824
00:37:10,072 --> 00:37:10,959
cool!

825
00:37:11,993 --> 00:37:14,633
My holes can take me anywhere.

-Hi.

830
00:37:24,822 --> 00:37:26,710
Sorry to bug you, I know you're busy, sorry.

00:37:26,735 --> 00:37:28,955
-What do you want?
-I know it's weird, I just came out of nowhere,

832
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:32,006
but I think I'm becoming a trans-dimensional superbeing.

833
00:37:32,031 --> 00:37:32,580
So?

-<i>So?</i>

I'm literally splitting the fabric of space and time!

For you, it's just a Tuesday night.

837

You're acting like weird stuff like this happens to you all the time.

Can I have some gum?

My holes aren't a curse!

843
00:37:56,647 --> 00:37:57,783
They're the answer!

844
00:37:57,808 --> 00:37:59,916
-Can you stop talking about your holes?

845
00:37:59,941 --> 00:38:01,573
You're making everyone uncomfortable over here.

846

00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:31,296
Can't you write smaller?

888
00:39:32,018 --> 00:39:33,485
Can't you write shorter?

889
00:39:35,618 --> 00:39:36,438
-[baker] Come again!

890
00:39:36,463 --> 00:39:39,090
-[Rio] Uhhh, what else can I say about Jeff?

891
00:39:39,588 --> 00:39:42,668
That he was <i>almost</i> ten pounds as a baby!

892
00:39:42,693 --> 00:39:44,212
I know, I know! You're gonna be embarrassed. You're gonna be...

893
00:39:44,237 --> 00:39:46,875
[muttering]...he almost killed his mother. Look at those shoulders.

894
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:49,177
-Oh, no. Okay, okay, okay, that's it, okay.
-He was a big baby.

895
00:39:49,202 --> 00:39:51,463
-Oh my God! [laughing]
-Okay. [laughing awkwardly]

896
00:39:51,488 --> 00:39:54,737
-Oh, he's so funny!
-Ohh, I'll take the mic. No more mics for you.

897
00:39:55,114 --> 00:39:57,540
-Thank you Rio, for that.
-[through her teeth] Where is that kid?

898
00:39:57,565 --> 00:40:00,410
-[Jeff] You know, I didn't always know what I wanted to do in life.

899
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:04,235
-I was pulled in a lot of different directions when I was young.

900
00:40:05,335 --> 00:40:07,275
-You know, me and my brother came up in this neighborhood,

901
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,726
-just a couple of knuckleheads running the streets.

902
00:40:09,751 --> 00:40:11,031
[villain exclaiming]

903
00:40:11,056 --> 00:40:12,385
[villain grunts]

904
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,953
[chuckling] You guys used to...

905
00:40:14,834 --> 00:40:16,547
-chase us outta your stores, and now,
-Hey! Taxi!

906
00:40:16,572 --> 00:40:18,740
-if you can believe it, it's my job to look out for you.
-Thank you. Thank you.

907
00:40:19,477 --> 00:40:21,483
-And then, I had a kid,
-Be right back!

908
00:40:21,508 --> 00:40:23,909
-and everything changed.

909
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,256
-For the better.

910
00:40:26,902 --> 00:40:29,588
-I mean, I don't even know about giving a toast, 'cuz I...
-Hey! Hey! Wait!

911
00:40:29,613 --> 00:40:31,028
-I should be toasting you all.

912
00:40:33,273 --> 00:40:34,818
So, to my brother,

913
00:40:34,843 --> 00:40:37,094
who we miss every single day.

914
00:40:38,313 --> 00:40:40,940
[laughing] He's definitely up there laughing at me, right now.

915
00:40:40,965 --> 00:40:42,765
They're making me captain, bro!

916
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:46,410
To my wife, <i>mi amor,</i>

917
00:40:46,435 --> 00:40:49,841
I can't even start, 'cuz I'll never stop.

918
00:40:49,866 --> 00:40:52,592
You'll have to take the mic from me! [laughing]

919
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:54,090
And to my son...

920
00:41:00,412 --> 00:41:01,392
[clears throat]

921
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:04,367
The reason that I do any of this in the first place.

922
00:41:06,019 --> 00:41:07,639
Well, I love you, Miles.

923
00:41:09,761 --> 00:41:13,041
And I will always, <i>always</i> be here for you.

924
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:21,677
Vinny, man, come on! Drop the beat!

925
00:41:23,341 --> 00:41:25,620
[Rio groaning] I'm gonna kill that kid.

926
00:41:25,905 --> 00:41:29,039
-Hey, congrats, Jeff!
-Hey, hey! Hey! [laughing]

927
00:41:29,064 --> 00:41:30,153
Thank you for coming!

928
00:41:48,835 --> 00:41:49,617
Hey, Miles!

929
00:41:49,642 --> 00:41:50,535
What's up, man?

930
00:41:51,502 --> 00:41:53,055
There you are. You keeping your head up with that school?

931
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,316
Oh, yeah. You bet.

932
00:41:54,705 --> 00:41:55,331
<i>¡Hola!</i>

933
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,637
Hey! Your parents have been looking for you.

934
00:41:58,662 --> 00:42:01,104
I don't know why, I've just been here the whole time.

935
00:42:01,129 --> 00:42:01,862
-<i>¡Oye!</i>
-Aaah!

936
00:42:01,887 --> 00:42:03,449
-Hi!
-You were supposed to be here at 5.

937
00:42:03,474 --> 00:42:05,351
-I know, I know, I know, but-
-You're disrespecting your dad!

938
00:42:05,376 --> 00:42:07,616
-Yep. Mm-hmm.
-Missed his beautiful toast,

939
00:42:07,641 --> 00:42:09,470
Come on, did you even see the cakes?

940
00:42:09,495 --> 00:42:11,297
There's some heartfelt messages on them!

941
00:42:15,051 --> 00:42:16,764
That's...not what I meant.

942
00:42:16,789 --> 00:42:18,726
Your dad studied for 8 months.

943
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:19,427
9!

944
00:42:19,805 --> 00:42:20,605
It was like giving birth!

945
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:21,231
[flatly] No it wasn't.

946
00:42:21,256 --> 00:42:21,851
Of course not.

947
00:42:21,876 --> 00:42:24,147
You made us sit in that office to talk to that lady without you!

948
00:42:24,172 --> 00:42:25,660
<i>Gah,</i> it was an emergency!

949
00:42:25,685 --> 00:42:27,270
What, a graffiti emergency?

950
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:29,340
A party with some friends I've never met emergency?!

951
00:42:29,365 --> 00:42:30,090
Explain yourself.

952
00:42:30,115 --> 00:42:32,263
[muttering] Sounds like you're explaining it pretty well.

953
00:42:32,288 --> 00:42:33,337
Ha. That's funny.

954
00:42:33,362 --> 00:42:34,879
Jeff, we have a funny son.

955
00:42:34,904 --> 00:42:35,535
I'm not laughing.

956
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:39,175
-¡Hola! [speaking Spanish]
-Hey! [speaking Spanish]

957
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,334
[speaking Spanish]

958
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:43,763
-I don't feel grown up.
-Wow, this is a cool shirt!

959
00:42:43,788 --> 00:42:44,905
-Okay! Okay, okay.
-It's like a...[unintelligible]

960
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:46,565
You know, have you checked out the [unintelligible] ?

961
00:42:49,547 --> 00:42:50,240
<i>¡Oye!</i>

962
00:42:50,265 --> 00:42:50,895
Aahh!

963
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,309
Who are you running around with, anyway?

964
00:42:52,334 --> 00:42:53,304
-Just...
-Is it Genki?

965
00:42:53,329 --> 00:42:54,161
I never liked him.

966
00:42:54,186 --> 00:42:55,058
Yes, you did!

967
00:42:55,083 --> 00:42:56,192
He calls me by my first name.

968
00:42:56,217 --> 00:42:57,260
<i>Ugh.</i> We hate that.

969
00:42:57,285 --> 00:42:59,063
I have more friends than just Genki.

970
00:42:59,088 --> 00:42:59,684
Like who?

971
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,273
Well, there's...there's...

972
00:43:01,298 --> 00:43:01,773
Peter.

973
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:03,324
Y'know? Uhh...

974
00:43:03,349 --> 00:43:06,133
But he left town, umm...there's...

975
00:43:06,158 --> 00:43:07,251
There's Gwanda!

976
00:43:07,276 --> 00:43:09,768
Y'know? She--she also...left town...

977
00:43:09,793 --> 00:43:11,268
Miles, <i>por favor, dame un</i> break.

978
00:43:11,293 --> 00:43:12,339
Is that Spanglish?

979
00:43:12,952 --> 00:43:16,372
Has it ever occurred to you that maybe, I'm just doing...

980
00:43:16,397 --> 00:43:20,139
benign, private, unremarkable things when I'm not with you guys?

981
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:20,658
-Nope.
-Never.

982
00:43:20,683 --> 00:43:22,272
I am 15 years old!

983
00:43:22,297 --> 00:43:24,457
-I am basically an adult!
-[sarcastically] Oh, right! Right.

984
00:43:24,482 --> 00:43:26,121
-You don't even have a driver's license!
-Neither does Mom!

985
00:43:26,146 --> 00:43:28,641
Because we live in New York, and never plan to leave.

986
00:43:28,943 --> 00:43:31,023
-It's <i>my</i> life!
-It's <i>not</i> your life!

987
00:43:31,407 --> 00:43:34,547
It's mine. And your father's, and your <i>abuelos y abuelas,</i>

988
00:43:34,572 --> 00:43:38,148
who put you in this spot I'd give <i>anything</i> to be in.

989
00:43:38,173 --> 00:43:39,973
Alright, alright. Whatever. Whatever.

990
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:44,172
<i>Whatever?</i>

991
00:43:44,197 --> 00:43:46,288
-Woooow.
-<i>Whatever?!</i>

992
00:43:46,313 --> 00:43:48,012
[laughing] Do I get to say it?

993
00:43:48,037 --> 00:43:49,519
-Please tell me that I can say it.
-Say it.

994
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:50,310
You're grounded!

995
00:43:50,335 --> 00:43:50,624
What?

996
00:43:50,649 --> 00:43:51,231
Oh, yeah!

997
00:43:51,256 --> 00:43:52,018
For how long?

998
00:43:52,043 --> 00:43:53,364
-A month!
-Dad!

999
00:43:53,389 --> 00:43:54,322
Mom, are you--

1000
00:43:54,347 --> 00:43:55,059
Seriously?

1001
00:43:55,084 --> 00:43:56,284
Yeah! Dead serious!

1002
00:43:56,309 --> 00:43:57,171
You don't understand!

1003
00:43:57,196 --> 00:43:58,727
You're right! You are right!

1004
00:43:58,752 --> 00:44:01,392
I have no idea what's going on with you!

1005
00:44:01,417 --> 00:44:03,706
-[music gets louder]
-[Jeff] So, why don't you tell me?
-[Miles] Just listen to me!

1006
00:44:03,731 --> 00:44:05,379
Okay, champ! You got it!

1007
00:44:05,404 --> 00:44:07,512
Go for it. Say whatever you wanna say.

1008
00:44:07,537 --> 00:44:09,706
What do you got to tell me so bad?!

1009
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:20,303
[sighing]

1010
00:44:20,328 --> 00:44:21,444
You know what?

1011
00:44:21,469 --> 00:44:22,170
Never mind.

1012
00:44:25,173 --> 00:44:27,007
[Jeff] Alright, great. Walk away.

1013
00:44:27,032 --> 00:44:28,828
Because now you got two months!

1014
00:44:32,844 --> 00:44:33,964
That was good, right?

1015
00:44:40,762 --> 00:44:41,502
[sighs]

1016
00:44:43,494 --> 00:44:44,647
Two months.

1017
00:44:46,336 --> 00:44:47,543
I'm Spiderman.

1018
00:44:47,567 --> 00:44:48,595
I'm not grounded.

1019
00:45:40,929 --> 00:45:41,723
-[Gwen, muffled] Miles!

1020
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:43,547
-Miles!

1021
00:45:44,626 --> 00:45:45,426
Got a minute?

1022
00:45:45,592 --> 00:45:47,079
Whoa! What...

1023
00:45:47,273 --> 00:45:49,080
[stammering] H-how did you get...

1024
00:45:50,613 --> 00:45:51,233
How did you get-

1025
00:45:51,672 --> 00:45:52,739
How have you been?

1026
00:45:52,764 --> 00:45:54,439
Uhh--I've been...good.

1027
00:45:54,464 --> 00:45:55,832
I've been...yeah, just great.

1028
00:45:55,857 --> 00:45:56,626
Look at you!

1029
00:45:57,074 --> 00:45:58,780
You, uhh...you grew, huh?

1030
00:45:58,805 --> 00:46:00,278
-Had a little growth spurt?
-Uhh, yeah.

1031
00:46:00,303 --> 00:46:02,871
Your hair has gotten...

1032
00:46:02,896 --> 00:46:03,378
pinker.

1033
00:46:03,403 --> 00:46:04,451
Is this the room you grew up in?

1034
00:46:04,476 --> 00:46:05,144
It is.

1035
00:46:05,169 --> 00:46:06,607
Umm...but...

1036
00:46:07,057 --> 00:46:09,277
My dorm room is--is...[deeper voice] very adult.

1037
00:46:09,591 --> 00:46:11,504
Cool, yeah, no, I used to play with these when I was younger, too.

1038
00:46:11,529 --> 00:46:12,436
[nervously] Uhh, that's...

1039
00:46:12,461 --> 00:46:13,946
-that's a...that's a collectible.
-Wow!

1040
00:46:13,971 --> 00:46:15,516
-I used to have this one!
-Actually, that's an

1041
00:46:15,541 --> 00:46:18,246
-extremely rare...highly sought-after...
-Why is it still in the package?

1042
00:46:18,271 --> 00:46:18,760
[groans in pain]

1043
00:46:18,785 --> 00:46:19,420
Um...

1044
00:46:19,445 --> 00:46:21,107
[uncomfortable laughing]

1045
00:46:21,132 --> 00:46:22,499
[tense] That's fine.

1046
00:46:24,118 --> 00:46:25,171
-Hey!
-Are these your drawings?

1047
00:46:25,196 --> 00:46:27,010
-What? No.
-Wow, they're good!

1048
00:46:29,102 --> 00:46:30,142
Wow, there's...

1049
00:46:30,167 --> 00:46:31,896
so...many...

1050
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:35,054
Missed you, too.

1051
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:37,047
So...

1052
00:46:37,072 --> 00:46:38,557
what are you doing here?

1053
00:46:38,582 --> 00:46:40,982
I-I mean, I...thought I'd...

1054
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:42,214
never see you again.

1055
00:46:43,568 --> 00:46:44,501
Wanna get outta here?

1056
00:46:45,551 --> 00:46:47,591
I'm...grounded.

1057
00:46:48,817 --> 00:46:49,697
Bummer.

1058
00:46:53,121 --> 00:46:54,847
Is Spiderman grounded?

1059
00:46:55,539 --> 00:46:56,386
Uhhh...

1060
00:46:58,527 --> 00:46:59,300
I mean, I-

1061
00:47:03,752 --> 00:47:04,705
[chuckling]

1062
00:47:06,098 --> 00:47:07,118
[Rio] Miles?

1063
00:47:07,443 --> 00:47:09,717
Your dad's ready to listen now.

1064
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:18,753
That's <i>three</i> months!

1065
00:47:20,498 --> 00:47:21,418
[Miles] Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.

1066
00:47:21,995 --> 00:47:25,608
There's an elite society with all the best Spiderpeople in it?

1067
00:47:25,649 --> 00:47:26,843
Okay, so there's this lady.

1068
00:47:26,868 --> 00:47:28,938
-Jess Drew. She rides a motorcycle,
-Uh-huh?

1069
00:47:28,963 --> 00:47:31,167
-A motorcycle?
-Oh my gosh, I'm learning <i>so much</i> from her!

1070
00:47:31,192 --> 00:47:33,348
Oh, yeah, I've...I've learned a lot of stuff, too.

1071
00:47:33,866 --> 00:47:35,259
I've leveled up my whole thing!

1072
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:36,147
See?

1073
00:47:36,172 --> 00:47:38,182
-Eh?
-Oh, yeah? Let's see it, then.

1074
00:47:38,207 --> 00:47:39,136
[Miles] Let's go!

1075
00:47:39,161 --> 00:47:40,141
Thread the needle!

1076
00:47:44,588 --> 00:47:45,168
Whoa!

1077
00:47:45,477 --> 00:47:47,563
[screaming]

1078
00:47:48,624 --> 00:47:49,404
Easy!

1079
00:47:49,810 --> 00:47:51,150
-[Miles laughing]
-And Miguel.

1080
00:47:51,175 --> 00:47:53,302
[echoing] The whole thing was his idea.

1081
00:47:53,327 --> 00:47:54,931
And...who's Miguel?

1082
00:47:54,956 --> 00:47:58,511
Oh, he's like a...ninja, vampire Spiderman, but a good guy?

1083
00:47:58,536 --> 00:48:00,124
A vampire good guy!

1084
00:48:00,149 --> 00:48:01,765
I'd pay good money to see that.

1085
00:48:01,790 --> 00:48:03,580
So, how long ago did they invite you?

1086
00:48:03,605 --> 00:48:05,818
Uh, only, like...a few months ago.

1087
00:48:05,843 --> 00:48:07,643
"Months" is kind of a long time, isn't it?

1088
00:48:07,668 --> 00:48:09,215
Okay, this one counts as two.

1089
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:14,290
Whooo!

1090
00:48:14,864 --> 00:48:15,791
[laughing]

1091
00:48:16,574 --> 00:48:17,460
Look at you.

1092
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:19,007
Look at me!

1093
00:48:20,573 --> 00:48:21,466
-[Miles] Keep the change!

1094
00:48:22,152 --> 00:48:23,005
[Miles] So, this club...

1095
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:24,089
Look at that dumb-dumb.

1096
00:48:24,114 --> 00:48:25,234
...What kind of stuff do you do?

1097
00:48:25,259 --> 00:48:26,502
Guy in the stripes. Ten points.

1098
00:48:27,048 --> 00:48:29,288
-We're trying to keep the multiverse from collapsing.

1099
00:48:29,537 --> 00:48:30,920
I thought we did that already.

1100
00:48:30,945 --> 00:48:33,440
Like, last week we had this mission to some Shakespeare dimension,

1101
00:48:33,465 --> 00:48:33,787
What?

1102
00:48:33,812 --> 00:48:35,627
-And Hobie and I just, like...
-Wait, wait, wait.

1103
00:48:35,652 --> 00:48:37,360
-Who--who's Hobie?
-Oh my gosh,

1104
00:48:37,385 --> 00:48:38,668
you would love him!

1105
00:48:38,693 --> 00:48:40,424
He lets me crash in his dimension sometimes.

1106
00:48:40,449 --> 00:48:42,951
Hey, what does that mean? You stay overnight, or...?

1107
00:48:42,976 --> 00:48:46,023
Anyway, listen, they're--they're pretty strict about where I go, or I...

1108
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:47,820
I really would've come to see you sooner.

1109
00:48:47,845 --> 00:48:48,670
Right...

1110
00:48:48,695 --> 00:48:49,455
so, uhh...

1111
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:51,109
so...so why'd you come now?
[smearing]

1112
00:48:51,134 --> 00:48:53,005
Don't--don't do that.

1113
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:53,737
Ah!

1114
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:57,001
Hey, Gw-...

1115
00:48:57,026 --> 00:48:58,519
uhh...Gwen?

1116
00:48:59,468 --> 00:49:00,428
Where'd you go?

1117
00:49:03,556 --> 00:49:04,503
Where'd she go...?

1118
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:17,471
Ah!

1119
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:18,975
Oh, hey. There you are.

1120
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:19,798
What are you doing?

1121
00:49:19,823 --> 00:49:20,517
Waitin' for you.

1122
00:49:33,661 --> 00:49:36,575
[Miles and Gwen laughing]

1123
00:49:37,735 --> 00:49:39,188
[Gwen] This is a cool thinking spot.

1124
00:49:39,213 --> 00:49:39,742
Right?

1125
00:49:40,108 --> 00:49:43,435
I mean, who needs a treadmill when you have the Williamsburg Bank building?

1126
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:49,085
So, uhh...you and your dad.

1127
00:49:49,972 --> 00:49:50,999
You still haven't talked?

1128
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:54,651
What exactly would we talk about? [laughs]

1129
00:49:54,676 --> 00:49:56,522
"Hey, Dad. How's the last few months been?"

1130
00:49:57,815 --> 00:49:59,832
[quietly] "You still think I murdered my best friend?"

1131
00:50:02,742 --> 00:50:03,301
Oh.

1132
00:50:03,681 --> 00:50:05,055
I mean, my parents...

1133
00:50:05,447 --> 00:50:06,707
I mean, maybe if I told them-

1134
00:50:06,732 --> 00:50:07,420
<i>Don't.</i>

1135
00:50:08,184 --> 00:50:09,637
Trust me on that.

1136
00:50:25,892 --> 00:50:26,605
Well...

1137
00:50:28,746 --> 00:50:31,375
Maybe, some things are supposed to be just for us.

1138
00:50:33,184 --> 00:50:33,771
[Gwen] Hmm.

1139
00:50:35,816 --> 00:50:37,469
That's a nice way to think about it.

1140
00:50:39,112 --> 00:50:42,355
I'm just...a really emotionally intelligent guy.

1141
00:50:43,133 --> 00:50:44,350
Beyond my years.

1142
00:50:44,663 --> 00:50:47,709
[chuckles]

1143
00:50:47,734 --> 00:50:49,887
You know, it really is always so great to talk to you.

1144
00:50:50,473 --> 00:50:51,086
Yeah?

1145
00:50:51,772 --> 00:50:52,252
Yeah.

1146
00:50:52,603 --> 00:50:53,590
[Miles chuckles]

1147
00:50:54,165 --> 00:50:57,251
I mean...how many people can you talk to about this stuff?

1148
00:50:58,798 --> 00:50:59,984
You don't even know.

1149
00:51:02,194 --> 00:51:03,047
[Gwen sighs]

1150
00:51:04,327 --> 00:51:05,113
[chuckling] What?

1151
00:51:07,156 --> 00:51:10,310
You're the only friend I've ever really made, after Peter died.

1152
00:51:11,901 --> 00:51:14,134
...Other than Hobie. Right?

1153
00:51:16,055 --> 00:51:17,238
That's different.

1154
00:51:17,263 --> 00:51:18,583
Yeah? How's that?

1155
00:51:18,936 --> 00:51:20,589
I don't know. You...

1156
00:51:21,221 --> 00:51:23,254
and me...it's...

1157
00:51:23,279 --> 00:51:24,847
We're...the same.

1158
00:51:28,073 --> 00:51:29,140
In the important ways.

1159
00:51:29,875 --> 00:51:30,601
Y'know?

1160
00:51:30,626 --> 00:51:31,125
[Laughs]

1161
00:51:33,593 --> 00:51:37,047
In every other universe, Gwen Stacy falls for Spiderman.

1162
00:51:43,549 --> 00:51:46,390
And in every other universe...

1163
00:51:46,936 --> 00:51:48,539
it doesn't end well.

1164
00:52:00,044 --> 00:52:00,844
Well...

1165
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:03,433
there's a first time for everything, right?

1166
00:52:04,353 --> 00:52:05,073
[chuckles]

1167
00:52:24,513 --> 00:52:25,240
-[Gwen] Mmm!

1168
00:52:25,454 --> 00:52:26,541
[chewing] Oh, wow.

1169
00:52:27,013 --> 00:52:28,160
Feelings make me hungry.

1170
00:52:28,185 --> 00:52:28,820
Oh, yeah.

1171
00:52:28,845 --> 00:52:31,061
These plátanos are just deep fried filling.

1172
00:52:33,369 --> 00:52:34,825
She looks old enough to vote.

1173
00:52:36,238 --> 00:52:38,305
I bet she doesn't even speak Spanish.

1174
00:52:38,963 --> 00:52:40,449
[speaks Spanish]

1175
00:52:41,545 --> 00:52:43,511
This keeps you from glitching in other dimensions?

1176
00:52:43,536 --> 00:52:44,439
-Yeah. It's pretty cool.

1177
00:52:44,464 --> 00:52:47,461
What's it gonna take for Miguel O'Hara to notice Miles Morales?

1178
00:52:47,486 --> 00:52:50,014
[chuckles] I'll put in a good word.

1179
00:52:50,039 --> 00:52:52,657
I'm just saying. If I had a watch, I could come with you.

1180
00:52:52,682 --> 00:52:53,444
Miles...

1181
00:52:53,469 --> 00:52:54,984
-Look...
-I <i>did</i> save the multiverse!

1182
00:52:55,009 --> 00:52:57,048
It's a...really small, elite strike force...

1183
00:52:57,073 --> 00:52:59,594
-I can turn invisible, I have like, electric powers...
-There's just-

1184
00:52:59,619 --> 00:53:01,380
-There aren't a lot of slots.
-Think about it!

1185
00:53:03,149 --> 00:53:04,589
Uh-huh. Right.

1186
00:53:05,288 --> 00:53:08,262
-Look, if it was up to me, you-
-Oh, I know. I know.

1187
00:53:11,097 --> 00:53:13,392
Oh, no! No, no, no! Don't do that! Miles!

1188
00:53:13,417 --> 00:53:14,006
[scoffs]

1189
00:53:14,031 --> 00:53:15,995
-Alright. Jeez.
-It's, uhh...it's really delicate.

1190
00:53:16,876 --> 00:53:17,710
[sighs]

1191
00:53:17,734 --> 00:53:20,622
Sorry. Didn't mean to, um...snap.

1192
00:53:20,647 --> 00:53:22,691
Okay. Alright. I'm sorry.

1193
00:53:22,716 --> 00:53:23,906
Helloooo!
[both exclaim]

1194
00:53:23,931 --> 00:53:26,646
-Hi. [laughs] I'm Miles' mom.
-Oh, boy.

1195
00:53:26,671 --> 00:53:27,957
Rio! Hi!

1196
00:53:27,982 --> 00:53:29,683
I've heard so much about you!

1197
00:53:29,708 --> 00:53:31,735
Huh. You're using my first name. Okay!

1198
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:34,160
This is nice. We found it in Miles' room, so...

1199
00:53:34,798 --> 00:53:36,945
I guess you must've been there. Huh?

1200
00:53:36,970 --> 00:53:37,816
And you must be Jeff.

1201
00:53:37,841 --> 00:53:40,260
[chuckling quietly] She called me Jeff. Heh, seriously. Jeff.

1202
00:53:40,285 --> 00:53:42,413
[firmly] You must mean Lieutenant Morales.

1203
00:53:42,438 --> 00:53:44,510
Soon to be <i>Captain</i> Morales.

1204
00:53:44,535 --> 00:53:46,216
Ah! Captain. [laughs]

1205
00:53:47,697 --> 00:53:50,717
Gwanda and I are friends from school.

1206
00:53:50,742 --> 00:53:52,196
Yeah, yeah. We were just catching up.

1207
00:53:52,221 --> 00:53:53,348
Ohhh.

1208
00:53:53,373 --> 00:53:54,335
Don't take him from me!

1209
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,068
-[laughing]
-Mom!

1210
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:58,954
I'm just kidding. He's grounded, so you can't.

1211
00:53:59,142 --> 00:54:00,368
-Don't break his heart.
-<i>Mom!</i>

1212
00:54:00,651 --> 00:54:01,564
[ringing] Shoot!

1213
00:54:01,589 --> 00:54:02,720
-Shoot, I have to go.
-[muffled speech from watch]

1214
00:54:02,745 --> 00:54:03,434
Really?

1215
00:54:03,459 --> 00:54:06,034
Yeah, I, uh...forgot to get my steps in! [awkward laugh]

1216
00:54:06,059 --> 00:54:08,189
Uhh, really...really wish I could stay longer.

1217
00:54:08,214 --> 00:54:09,442
I, uh...[whispers] I'm sorry.

1218
00:54:10,353 --> 00:54:11,046
Goodbye.

1219
00:54:15,404 --> 00:54:16,297
...Yeah. Bye.

1220
00:54:51,741 --> 00:54:53,868
I can hear you being quiet, Mom.

1221
00:54:55,194 --> 00:54:56,100
I, um...

1222
00:54:56,810 --> 00:54:58,778
hope I didn't <i>ice your game,</i> man.

1223
00:54:59,446 --> 00:55:02,753
No one my age says those words in that order, Mom.

1224
00:55:03,581 --> 00:55:05,047
It's just...

1225
00:55:05,072 --> 00:55:09,245
hard, to see my little man not be my little boy all the time.

1226
00:55:10,879 --> 00:55:11,839
Yeah.

1227
00:55:17,215 --> 00:55:19,208
I hope you know you can tell me anything.

1228
00:55:23,092 --> 00:55:25,005
[speaks Spanish]

1229
00:55:29,731 --> 00:55:30,271
Well...

1230
00:55:50,323 --> 00:55:51,196
I'm...

1231
00:55:56,628 --> 00:55:57,695
[sighs]

1232
00:55:58,244 --> 00:55:59,338
I'm sorry I was late.

1233
00:56:09,031 --> 00:56:09,745
Go.

1234
00:56:12,751 --> 00:56:14,971
She seems like a...nice girl.

1235
00:56:17,428 --> 00:56:18,214
Is this a trick?

1236
00:56:18,239 --> 00:56:19,441
It's not a trick.

1237
00:56:20,019 --> 00:56:20,659
Jeez.

1238
00:56:21,612 --> 00:56:22,245
What're you...

1239
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:24,523
Lemme fix you, just...[sighs]

1240
00:56:25,476 --> 00:56:28,209
well, for years, I've been taking care of this little boy, right?

1241
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:31,327
Making sure he's loved,

1242
00:56:32,165 --> 00:56:35,618
that he feels like he belongs wherever he wants to be,

1243
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:40,503
he wants to go out into the world and do great big things...

1244
00:56:41,801 --> 00:56:43,434
and what I worry about most

1245
00:56:45,024 --> 00:56:47,697
is...they won't look out for you, like us.

1246
00:56:49,019 --> 00:56:51,252
They won't root for you, like us.

1247
00:56:53,862 --> 00:56:54,569
So.

1248
00:56:55,319 --> 00:56:56,639
Here's the deal.

1249
00:56:57,843 --> 00:56:59,062
Wherever you go from here

1250
00:56:59,086 --> 00:57:02,076
you have to promise to take care of that little boy for me.

1251
00:57:03,095 --> 00:57:05,108
Make sure he never forgets where he came from.

1252
00:57:06,387 --> 00:57:07,328
And...

1253
00:57:07,758 --> 00:57:09,798
he never doubts that he is loved.

1254
00:57:11,054 --> 00:57:13,547
And he never lets <i>anyone</i>

1255
00:57:13,572 --> 00:57:16,461
at those big fancy places he's gonna be in...

1256
00:57:17,164 --> 00:57:20,031
tell him that he doesn't belong there.

1257
00:57:21,284 --> 00:57:24,024
And when he comes home--and he'd <i>better</i> come home!

1258
00:57:26,475 --> 00:57:27,676
You're gonna be early,

1259
00:57:28,402 --> 00:57:31,228
and you're gonna be holding a normal, nice cake.

1260
00:57:31,519 --> 00:57:33,073
[laughing] Yeah, okay.

1261
00:57:33,833 --> 00:57:35,186
You gotta promise, Miles.

1262
00:57:35,889 --> 00:57:36,869
I promise.

1263
00:57:37,890 --> 00:57:38,496
Just...

1264
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:41,545

1265
00:57:41,570 --> 00:57:42,853

00:57:46,417 --> 00:57:47,171

Now, get--go. Get outta here.

1273
00:58:00,914 --> 00:58:02,627
But when you come back, you're still grounded.

1274

[laughs]

1275
00:58:03,406 --> 00:58:05,987
[laughs] Yeah, I'm smiling like it's a joke, but it's true.

1276
00:58:06,012 --> 00:58:07,608
Yeah, I-I figured.

1277
00:58:08,408 --> 00:58:09,388
See you later.

1278
00:58:10,390 --> 00:58:11,084

-[Gwen] Shoot!
-Never did come up with a cool name for that...

1294

This should work!

What?

1357
01:01:47,771 --> 01:01:48,864
-[Lyla] He can jump wherever he wants.

Every dimension he stops at has an Alchemax.

Don't tell Miguel.

1370
01:02:10,034 --> 01:02:10,954

1371
01:02:11,494 --> 01:02:12,641
what if he sends me home?

1372
01:02:14,658 --> 01:02:15,598

Never got too close to someone?

01:02:27,907 --> 01:02:29,200
But I got over it.

-Oh, thank you. Thank you so much,
-Yeah. Okay.

1382
01:02:37,425 --> 01:02:39,439
-I promise I will not let you down again.
-You're welcome. Shut up.

1383
01:02:40,743 --> 01:02:42,690
You got an hour to fix this,

1384
01:02:43,677 --> 01:02:44,863

01:05:02,641 --> 01:05:04,182
-[Miles] Gwen! I'm here to help!

1412
01:05:04,207 --> 01:05:04,801
Miles?!

1413
01:05:04,826 --> 01:05:05,360
[grunts]

1414
01:05:05,385 --> 01:05:06,274
-[Spot] Foot in your face!

1415
01:05:06,299 --> 01:05:07,620
-You weren't expecting that, were you?

1416
01:05:07,645 --> 01:05:08,294
[crash] [grunts]

1417
01:05:08,319 --> 01:05:09,198
Oh, no!

1418
01:05:09,223 --> 01:05:11,112
Neither was I! I'm in the zone!

1419
01:05:11,137 --> 01:05:11,659
<i>Whoo!</i>

1420
01:05:13,670 --> 01:05:14,417
I got you!

1421
01:05:14,847 --> 01:05:16,227
-Did you follow me?!
-No!

1422
01:05:16,252 --> 01:05:18,914
I just saw where you went, and...

1423
01:05:18,939 --> 01:05:20,116
went there without you knowing.

1424
01:05:20,141 --> 01:05:21,434
You're not supposed to be here!

1425
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:22,924
What are you talking about? I'm helping-

1426
01:05:25,129 --> 01:05:25,623
No!

1427
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:28,140
No, no, no no no no no no! No!

1428
01:05:29,098 --> 01:05:29,731
-[grunts]

1429
01:05:30,429 --> 01:05:31,015
Whoa!

1430
01:05:31,616 --> 01:05:32,374
[Miles grunts]

1431
01:05:32,399 --> 01:05:33,853
I shouldn't have <i>ever</i> come to see you.

1432
01:05:34,695 --> 01:05:35,262
Dang.

1433
01:05:38,427 --> 01:05:39,153
<i>Hyah!</i>

1434
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:40,440
<i>Ahh!</i>

1435
01:05:44,433 --> 01:05:45,847
Hey, who's the new guy?

1436
01:05:45,872 --> 01:05:46,608
[Gwen] Hey, Pav.

1437
01:05:46,633 --> 01:05:48,629
He's Miles, and he wasn't invited.

1438
01:05:48,654 --> 01:05:51,546
[laughing] Oooh, you weren't invited, and you came anyway?

1439
01:05:51,571 --> 01:05:51,908
Right?

1440
01:05:51,933 --> 01:05:54,300
Hey, new guy must be in love with you.

1441
01:05:54,325 --> 01:05:55,359
-[Miles] No...!
-[Gwen] Okay, whoa.

1442
01:05:55,384 --> 01:05:56,169
I'm not.

1443
01:05:56,194 --> 01:05:57,594
-Oh, I'm very good at reading people.
-No, he's not.

1444
01:05:57,619 --> 01:05:58,163
Who are you?

1445
01:05:58,188 --> 01:05:59,483
I'm glad you asked, new guy!

1446
01:05:59,508 --> 01:06:00,672
-I'm not a new guy.

1447
01:06:00,697 --> 01:06:03,089
My name is Pravitr Prabhakar.

1448
01:06:03,114 --> 01:06:04,457
And, for the past 6 months,

1449
01:06:04,482 --> 01:06:05,044
<i>Six?</i>

1450
01:06:05,069 --> 01:06:06,357
And even <i>he</i> got a watch?

1451
01:06:06,382 --> 01:06:07,018
Yeah, uhh...

1452
01:06:07,043 --> 01:06:09,234
Being Spiderman is so easy!

1453
01:06:09,259 --> 01:06:11,576
-I wake up, skip the workout, because I'm naturally buff,

1454
01:06:11,601 --> 01:06:13,003
and I don't wanna get too big, you know?

1455
01:06:13,028 --> 01:06:14,981
Do almost nothing with my <i>amazing</i> hair,

1456
01:06:15,006 --> 01:06:16,377
You don't use any product at all?

1457
01:06:16,402 --> 01:06:18,415
Just coconut oil, prayer, some genetics...

1458
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:21,157
Then I swing by school, don't really have to try, but I do anyway,

1459
01:06:21,182 --> 01:06:22,075
fight a few bad guys,

1460
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:23,282
feed a few street dogs,

1461
01:06:23,307 --> 01:06:25,196
quick break for a cup of chai with my Maya auntie,

1462
01:06:25,221 --> 01:06:26,238
I love chai tea!

1463
01:06:26,263 --> 01:06:27,725
What did you just say...?

1464
01:06:27,936 --> 01:06:29,063
<i>"Chai tea"?</i>

1465
01:06:29,088 --> 01:06:30,978
-"Chai" means tea, bro!
-Oh.

1466
01:06:31,003 --> 01:06:32,297
-You're saying "tea tea!"
-Oh, umm...uh...

1467
01:06:32,322 --> 01:06:33,399
Would I ask you for a "coffee coffee"?

1468
01:06:33,424 --> 01:06:35,066
-Hmm? Or "cream cream"?
-I'm sorry...I'm sorry!

1469
01:06:35,091 --> 01:06:35,757
I'm so sorry.

1470
01:06:35,782 --> 01:06:38,539
-Then, I hang out with my girlfriend, <i>Gayatri.</i>

1471
01:06:38,564 --> 01:06:40,969
-She's an extremely classy teenager.

1472
01:06:40,994 --> 01:06:43,448
Hey, girl. Tonight, I was thinking...

1473
01:06:43,473 --> 01:06:45,340
Ah, hello, police inspector Singh!

1474
01:06:45,365 --> 01:06:47,351
-This is your daughter, I do <i>not</i> know her.

1475
01:06:47,376 --> 01:06:48,466
-And to top it off,

1476
01:06:48,491 --> 01:06:51,006
I live in the best possible Spiderman city,

1477
01:06:51,031 --> 01:06:51,780
Mumbattan.

1478
01:06:51,805 --> 01:06:52,378
Quick tour.

1479
01:06:52,403 --> 01:06:53,295
This is where the traffic is,

1480
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:53,971
this is where the traffic is,

1481
01:06:53,996 --> 01:06:54,893
this is also where the traffic is,

1482
01:06:54,918 --> 01:06:55,580
there's traffic here, too!

1483
01:06:55,605 --> 01:06:57,193
And this is where the British stole all of our stuff!

1484
01:06:59,932 --> 01:07:00,659
-[Spot] Ahh.

1485
01:07:01,203 --> 01:07:02,383
Hello, Spiderman.

1486
01:07:02,408 --> 01:07:03,081
-Hi.
-Hey.

1487
01:07:03,106 --> 01:07:03,865
Not <i>you.</i>

1488
01:07:03,890 --> 01:07:05,558
-[Gwen] Are you talking to him, or me? Or...him?
-[Pavitr] Well, what's that...that's me.

1489
01:07:05,583 --> 01:07:06,384
I think he means me.

1490
01:07:06,409 --> 01:07:07,211
Yeah. Him.

1491
01:07:07,373 --> 01:07:08,727
I got this, guys!

1492
01:07:08,856 --> 01:07:09,570
Huh?

1493
01:07:09,595 --> 01:07:10,892
Wow! How are you?

1494
01:07:12,435 --> 01:07:13,855
Since I leveled up my game,

1495
01:07:14,284 --> 01:07:16,471
I'm on a journey of self-improvement!

1496
01:07:16,496 --> 01:07:18,420
And you came to India.

1497
01:07:18,445 --> 01:07:20,298
That's a Western culture cliche!

1498
01:07:20,323 --> 01:07:21,658
[unintelligible]

1499
01:07:21,683 --> 01:07:23,393
No, no, no! I did not mean it like that!

1500
01:07:23,418 --> 01:07:23,906
Now, let me guess.

1501
01:07:23,931 --> 01:07:27,029
You wanna ask me about saffron and cardamom and naan bread,

1502
01:07:27,054 --> 01:07:30,409
which is the same as saying "bread bread", which is the same as saying "chai tea"!

1503
01:07:30,434 --> 01:07:31,396
Oh, I love chai tea!

1504
01:07:31,421 --> 01:07:32,286
<i>No!</i>

1505
01:07:32,311 --> 01:07:33,055
[Pavitr screaming] [Gwen grunts]

1506
01:07:33,582 --> 01:07:34,628
C'mon, man!

1507
01:07:35,112 --> 01:07:37,299
I think maybe we got off on the wrong foot.

1508
01:07:37,324 --> 01:07:38,387
Let's talk about this!

1509
01:07:38,412 --> 01:07:39,006
Fine.

1510
01:07:39,031 --> 01:07:41,966
You made me feel empty, like I had a hole inside of me!

1511
01:07:41,991 --> 01:07:43,299
We all have holes.

1512
01:07:44,348 --> 01:07:46,511
But now, I found out what to fill that hole up with!

1513
01:07:47,457 --> 01:07:48,570
More holes!

1514
01:07:48,595 --> 01:07:50,416
That doesn't make any sense!

1515
01:07:50,441 --> 01:07:51,332
-It will!

1516
01:07:51,864 --> 01:07:53,221
Okay. I'm good.

1517
01:07:53,246 --> 01:07:54,642
-Don't worry.
-[Gwen] We won't.

1518
01:07:54,841 --> 01:07:57,321
This romantic tension is so palpable!

1519
01:07:57,346 --> 01:07:58,451
-Will they, won't they...?

1520
01:07:58,476 --> 01:08:00,945
If Spot gets more holes, he'll be unstoppable!

1521
01:08:00,970 --> 01:08:01,935
We can't let him get to-

1522
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:02,875
[Gwen] Alchemax?

1523
01:08:03,154 --> 01:08:04,941
How can you guys even concentrate?

1524
01:08:05,363 --> 01:08:06,209
[scientists scream]

1525
01:08:06,695 --> 01:08:08,469
[Pavitr] Hey, does he know about Hobie?

1526
01:08:08,494 --> 01:08:10,035
What should I know about Hobie?

1527
01:08:10,060 --> 01:08:11,908
Oh, looks like he did not know.

1528
01:08:14,489 --> 01:08:14,943
Boop.

1529
01:08:17,541 --> 01:08:19,081
Go away. Go away.

1530
01:08:19,106 --> 01:08:20,321
See you later. Take some holes.

1531
01:08:21,032 --> 01:08:24,265
Hey, you! Could you please deactivate this wonderfully strong barrier?

1532
01:08:24,290 --> 01:08:26,747
[scientist] It can't be turned off until the collider sequence is complete!

1533
01:08:26,772 --> 01:08:28,082
Collider sequence?

1534
01:08:31,592 --> 01:08:34,146
-[Miles] Wait! You don't know what you're doing, man!
-[Gwen] Spot, you need to stop!

1535
01:08:34,171 --> 01:08:37,037
I'm about to be so much more than a villain of the week.

1536
01:08:37,062 --> 01:08:40,762
-[Miles] I'm sorry I called you that, okay? You're a great villain.

1537
01:08:41,181 --> 01:08:42,227
Oh, not yet, I'm not.

1538
01:08:42,252 --> 01:08:43,721
[computer] Initializing collider.

1539
01:08:44,222 --> 01:08:45,042
No!

1540
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:47,449
[grunting]

1541
01:08:50,681 --> 01:08:52,271
How's it going now?

1542
01:08:52,296 --> 01:08:52,956
Great!

1543
01:08:53,342 --> 01:08:54,359
Anyone got any ideas?

1544
01:08:54,391 --> 01:08:57,111
[Pavitr laughing] I have somebody in mind for this!

1545
01:08:57,608 --> 01:08:58,368
Stand back.

1546
01:08:58,874 --> 01:09:00,474
I've been working on something new.

1547
01:09:11,763 --> 01:09:14,197
[Pavitr] I'm not following what's happening right now.

1548
01:09:14,222 --> 01:09:15,452
[Miles straining] Just give me a second.

1549
01:09:15,477 --> 01:09:18,018
[Gwen] Do--do you want us to do something, or do we just stand here?

1550
01:09:18,043 --> 01:09:19,632
Are you like, charging it...?

1551
01:09:19,657 --> 01:09:21,708
No, I'm absorbing it so I can send it back!

1552
01:09:21,733 --> 01:09:23,353
-[Gwen] It looks like you're just...
-[Pavitr] Does his power have a name?

1553
01:09:23,378 --> 01:09:26,253
-[Miles] Please, hold your questions until I'm done breaking this thing!
-[Gwen and Pavitr overlapping]

1554
01:09:27,130 --> 01:09:28,557
Just let me do this!

1555
01:09:28,582 --> 01:09:29,189
[Hobie] Oi!

1556
01:09:42,350 --> 01:09:42,830
Hobie!

1557
01:09:43,047 --> 01:09:44,587
[Pavitr] Hobie, my guy!

1558
01:09:44,612 --> 01:09:44,984
[Miles] Hobie?

1559
01:09:45,009 --> 01:09:46,011
Look at that. Another one.

1560
01:09:46,036 --> 01:09:48,708
I love how many different variations of you guys there are. I mean...

1561
01:09:48,733 --> 01:09:50,558
My left palm, big step up!

1562
01:09:50,583 --> 01:09:51,120
You got me?

1563
01:09:51,145 --> 01:09:52,047
What's this dude saying?

1564
01:09:52,072 --> 01:09:55,619
[Pavitr] It's English for "we get along great and we're close friends"!

1565
01:09:55,644 --> 01:09:57,026
Is this the other one, from 1610?

1566
01:09:57,051 --> 01:09:58,149
-Do you understand this guy?
-Huh.

1567
01:09:58,174 --> 01:10:00,467
Hey, Hobie! Thanks for breaking the shield!

1568
01:10:00,492 --> 01:10:01,538
I loosened it.

1569
01:10:01,563 --> 01:10:02,540
Bit of advice:

1570
01:10:02,565 --> 01:10:04,122
Use the palm, not just your fingers.

1571
01:10:05,474 --> 01:10:06,407
Also, your suit.

1572
01:10:06,432 --> 01:10:07,620
Is he bleeding from his armpits?

1573
01:10:07,645 --> 01:10:08,860
[quickly] Miles, Hobie. Hobie, Miles.

1574
01:10:08,885 --> 01:10:11,834
Hi. I've never heard of you, because Gwen barely ever mentioned you.

1575
01:10:12,010 --> 01:10:14,256
Hi, my name's Hobie. Hobie Brown.

1576
01:10:14,281 --> 01:10:16,115
I was bitten by a...wouldn't you like to know?

1577
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:16,929
Yeah, I'm here.

1578
01:10:16,954 --> 01:10:19,172
And for the last three years, I've been the one and only--wait, wait.

1579
01:10:19,197 --> 01:10:19,878
Hang on, wait, wait.

1580
01:10:20,552 --> 01:10:22,060
Think I'm gonna show you my secret identity?

1581
01:10:22,085 --> 01:10:22,965
Come out of it!

1582
01:10:22,990 --> 01:10:25,948
That is, when I'm not playing shows, antagonizing fascists,

1583
01:10:25,979 --> 01:10:29,257
staging unpermitted political action-slash-performance art pieces,

1584
01:10:29,282 --> 01:10:29,693
Or,

1585
01:10:29,718 --> 01:10:31,346
having a laugh at a pub in [unintelligible]

1586
01:10:31,371 --> 01:10:32,257
I'm not a role model.

1587
01:10:32,282 --> 01:10:33,777
I was briefly a runway model.

1588
01:10:33,802 --> 01:10:35,623
I hate the AM, I hate the PM,

1589
01:10:35,648 --> 01:10:36,529
I hate labels,

1590
01:10:36,554 --> 01:10:37,535
I'm not a hero,

1591
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:40,361
'cuz calling yourself a "hero" makes you a self-mythologizing,

1592
01:10:40,386 --> 01:10:41,992
narcissistic autocrat.

1593
01:10:42,017 --> 01:10:43,509
Oh, I thought you hated labels.

1594
01:10:43,802 --> 01:10:45,669
Gwendy, you left your jumper around my place.

1595
01:10:45,694 --> 01:10:46,312
What's a jumper?

1596
01:10:46,337 --> 01:10:47,406
It's a sweater.

1597
01:10:47,431 --> 01:10:48,845
How many sweaters do you have?

1598
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:50,714
Uh--that's...that's not my nature.

1599
01:10:50,739 --> 01:10:51,554
And your toothbrush.

1600
01:10:51,579 --> 01:10:52,542
Wait, what?

1601
01:10:52,567 --> 01:10:53,180
[Pavitr screams]

1602
01:10:53,205 --> 01:10:54,037
Are those my chucks?

1603
01:10:54,062 --> 01:10:54,405
[Gwen laughs nervously]

1604
01:10:56,799 --> 01:10:57,105
[Gwen grunts]

1605
01:10:57,130 --> 01:10:58,518
Y'all make a heck of a team.

1606
01:10:58,543 --> 01:10:59,665
[Hobie] I don't believe in teams.

1607
01:10:59,690 --> 01:11:00,896
[Miles] Aren't you in a band?

1608
01:11:00,921 --> 01:11:02,372
I don't believe in consistency.

1609
01:11:02,697 --> 01:11:04,123
This guy is killing me.

1610
01:11:04,478 --> 01:11:05,093
Ahh!

1611
01:11:05,418 --> 01:11:06,032
[grunts]

1612
01:11:06,057 --> 01:11:07,667
This is gonna be good for us, Spiderman.

1613
01:11:09,397 --> 01:11:11,983
You and me are finally gonna live up to our potential.

1614
01:11:12,549 --> 01:11:14,841
You'll finally have a villain worth fighting,

1615
01:11:14,866 --> 01:11:16,893
and I won't be just a <i>joke</i> to you!

1616
01:11:25,711 --> 01:11:26,191
[Spot grunts]

1617
01:11:26,665 --> 01:11:28,405
You're not a joke! Right, gang?

1618
01:11:28,430 --> 01:11:31,164
-[Gwen] Absolutely!
-[Pavitr] Completely unamusing!
-[Hobie] I don't believe in comedy!

1619
01:11:32,007 --> 01:11:32,909
[Hobie] Just kidding!

1620
01:11:32,934 --> 01:11:33,821
[Miles] See?

1621
01:11:33,846 --> 01:11:35,538
No one here thinks you're a joke!

1622
01:11:35,563 --> 01:11:36,531
They won't after this.

1623
01:11:37,104 --> 01:11:37,904
[Miles] No!

1624
01:11:43,930 --> 01:11:45,757
-[Pavitr] Well, that was another easy adventure

1625
01:11:45,796 --> 01:11:46,535
-for Spiderman!
-[all] No, no, no!!

1626
01:11:47,485 --> 01:11:50,125
[all screaming]

1627
01:12:04,913 --> 01:12:06,173
[distorted] I'm coming!

1628
01:12:09,862 --> 01:12:11,155
Huh...

1629
01:12:16,546 --> 01:12:17,726
What was that?

1630
01:12:20,758 --> 01:12:21,705
[distorted] Our future.

1631
01:12:23,813 --> 01:12:25,726
I'm gonna take everything from you.

1632
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:28,507
Like you took everything from me.

1633
01:12:30,371 --> 01:12:31,244
[whispers] What?

1634
01:12:31,779 --> 01:12:33,439
-See you back home...

1635
01:12:33,976 --> 01:12:35,316
Spiderman.

1636
01:12:38,824 --> 01:12:40,630
[muffled] Miles? Miles!

1637
01:12:41,070 --> 01:12:44,876
[muffled overlapped speech]

1638
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:51,280

[crowd screaming]

1640
01:13:04,567 --> 01:13:06,020
We'll clear the path,

1641
01:13:06,045 --> 01:13:07,611
you slow down that building!

1642
01:13:07,904 --> 01:13:09,931
I'll do it, but not because you told me to.

1643
01:13:16,310 --> 01:13:17,484
[straining]

1644
01:13:18,065 --> 01:13:19,125
Everybody, run!

1649
01:14:28,033 --> 01:14:28,933
[Lyla] Gwen, heads up.

1650
01:14:28,958 --> 01:14:30,980
Markers are predicting an incoming canon event,

1651
01:14:31,005 --> 01:14:31,939
so tread carefully.

1652
01:14:32,389 --> 01:14:33,489
-[man exclaims]
-I'm on it.

1653
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:37,086
Somebody help!

1654
01:14:37,111 --> 01:14:38,552
-Hurry, everyone! This way, quickly!
-Help!

1655
01:14:45,192 --> 01:14:46,452

I got him, I got him!

-Miles!

1662
01:15:00,228 --> 01:15:02,228
Don't worry. Thread the needle, ring the bell, right?

1663
01:15:02,253 --> 01:15:03,145
It's too dangerous.

1664
01:15:03,170 --> 01:15:04,718
I'll be okay, I--I promise.

1665
01:15:04,743 --> 01:15:06,281

1671
01:15:28,866 --> 01:15:30,086
Come on!

You're alright!

1674

Oh!

1676
01:15:44,847 --> 01:15:46,288
Are you okay? I was so worried!

1677
01:15:46,313 --> 01:15:47,581
[clears throat] I mean...

1678
01:15:47,606 --> 01:15:50,640
You seem like a nice young woman that I do not know!

Not bad, right?

1684
01:16:03,209 --> 01:16:03,808
Right.

1685
01:16:05,767 --> 01:16:08,300
I have never seen him so emotional!

1686
01:16:08,325 --> 01:16:09,252
Excellent job.

1687
01:16:19,647 --> 01:16:21,687
Done, done!

You're amazing.

[Pavitr] Guys, what's that?

1700
01:16:58,126 --> 01:16:59,540
It's a metaphor for capitalism.

1701
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:03,187
It's a lot worse than that.

1702
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:12,648
-[Jess] Okay, guys. Secure the area, clear all civilians,

1703
01:17:12,672 --> 01:17:14,427
and let's contain this quantum hole.

Hey, I'm Miles. Uh...

01:17:15,564 --> 01:17:17,963
We actually met before. When I was invisible.

1706
01:17:17,988 --> 01:17:19,171
I know who you are.

1707
01:17:22,727 --> 01:17:24,485
Is everything going to be okay?

1708
01:17:33,187 --> 01:17:33,899
[Gwen] Okay...

1709
01:17:33,924 --> 01:17:36,477
-let me--let me explain.
-Miguel wants you back at HQ.

1710
01:17:36,502 --> 01:17:37,738
Miles was just about to head out, for...

1711
01:17:37,763 --> 01:17:39,017
<i>All</i> of you.

1712
01:17:39,042 --> 01:17:40,750
I don't follow orders. Neither does he.

1713
01:17:40,775 --> 01:17:41,955
I'm invited to HQ?

1714
01:17:42,515 --> 01:17:43,375
Whoo!

1715
01:17:57,659 --> 01:17:59,992
How are you even cooler under your mask?

1716
01:18:00,363 --> 01:18:01,816
I was just cool the whole time.

1717
01:18:10,002 --> 01:18:10,874
Dang.

1718
01:18:18,593 --> 01:18:19,410
Hey.

1719
01:18:19,435 --> 01:18:20,195
Over here.

1720
01:18:25,929 --> 01:18:27,175
Yo!

1721
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:28,575
This place is wild!

1722
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:29,495
-[Jess] Any sign of Spot?

1723
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:30,347
Let me ask.

1724
01:18:30,372 --> 01:18:32,374
Hey, anybody <i>spot</i> Spot?

1725
01:18:32,399 --> 01:18:34,349
Oh, so funny. Anybody else got jokes?

-Now that you mention it...
-[spiderpeople chattering]

1727
01:18:39,834 --> 01:18:41,640
This is unbelievable!

1728
01:18:41,665 --> 01:18:42,897
This is the lobby.

1729
01:18:43,317 --> 01:18:43,810
Oh.

1730
01:18:44,432 --> 01:18:47,718
Welcome to Spider society!

1731
01:18:56,913 --> 01:18:58,193
Bit much, innit?

1732
01:18:58,825 --> 01:19:01,572
What happened to that small elite strike team?

1733
01:19:01,597 --> 01:19:02,682
A lot of these are part-time.

1734
01:19:04,593 --> 01:19:06,046
Gwendy, how much have you told him?

1735
01:19:06,450 --> 01:19:08,177
Hmm? About his place in all this.

1736
01:19:08,505 --> 01:19:09,025
A little.

Ahh. [pants]

1739
01:19:11,075 --> 01:19:11,871
[Hobie] Maybe not enough.

1740
01:19:12,510 --> 01:19:13,164
Here.

1741
01:19:13,741 --> 01:19:15,501
Oh! My own watch!

1742
01:19:15,526 --> 01:19:16,936
-It's a day pass.
-Oh.

1743
01:19:16,961 --> 01:19:17,805
-This just keeps you from-

Hup, hup, hup!

1747
01:19:22,350 --> 01:19:23,765
-Hey, Gwen!
-Hey, Peter.

I'm, uh...I'm a new recruit.

1751
01:19:28,505 --> 01:19:32,225
Peter, take a team to the transport deck to help deal with this Spot mess.

[beep beep]

1753
01:19:32,947 --> 01:19:34,607
I wouldn't call it a <i>mess.</i>

1754
01:19:34,632 --> 01:19:36,718
More like a...success in progress.

1755
01:19:36,743 --> 01:19:37,265
Ben, I need-

1756
01:19:37,290 --> 01:19:39,452
Sorry. I can't talk right now.

1757
01:19:40,131 --> 01:19:42,938

-Actually, we need you here, for some reason.

[wailing in anguish]

1759
01:19:44,309 --> 01:19:46,497
That was a particularly...<i>harrowing</i> memory.

1760
01:19:46,522 --> 01:19:47,182
Is...is he okay?

1761
01:19:47,207 --> 01:19:48,179
Ahh!

1762
01:19:48,204 --> 01:19:50,204
Hey. The name's Web-Slinger.

1763
01:19:50,229 --> 01:19:52,266
Why does the horse need a mask?

1764
01:19:52,291 --> 01:19:54,019
To conceal her face.

1765
01:19:54,233 --> 01:19:55,847
Giddy...up!

1766
01:19:55,872 --> 01:19:56,993
[roaring]

1767
01:19:57,018 --> 01:19:58,894
Who is in these laser cages?

1768
01:19:58,919 --> 01:20:01,212
Anomalies. Folks who wound up in the wrong dimension.

1769
01:20:01,237 --> 01:20:03,167
-[Jess] We kick their butts, and send 'em home!

1770
01:20:03,192 --> 01:20:04,060
They're not very interesting.

1771
01:20:04,085 --> 01:20:04,500
What?

1772
01:20:04,525 --> 01:20:06,402
-We got a bunch'a Doc Ocs.
-Well, that's interesting!

1773
01:20:06,427 --> 01:20:07,814
-A Mysterio,
-Ooh.

1774
01:20:07,839 --> 01:20:08,772
a <i>Miss</i>terio.

1775
01:20:08,797 --> 01:20:09,867
-Wow!
-Video game guy,

1776
01:20:09,892 --> 01:20:11,114
-I love video games!

1777
01:20:11,139 --> 01:20:12,329
another video game guy...

1778
01:20:12,354 --> 01:20:13,378
Are you talking to me?

1779
01:20:13,403 --> 01:20:14,572
<i>Typeface.</i>

1780
01:20:14,597 --> 01:20:16,802
Go to <i>Helvetica,</i> Spiderman!

1781
01:20:16,827 --> 01:20:17,234
Bold.

1782
01:20:17,259 --> 01:20:18,658
An interesting Kraven,

1783
01:20:18,683 --> 01:20:20,079
a boring rhino,

1784
01:20:20,104 --> 01:20:21,184
a Prowler,

1785
01:20:21,209 --> 01:20:22,220
Prowler?

1786
01:20:22,245 --> 01:20:22,944
-[Gwen] Not your Prowler.

1787
01:20:24,285 --> 01:20:25,024
Hey.

1788
01:20:26,380 --> 01:20:26,980
Hey.

1789
01:20:30,385 --> 01:20:31,865
It's rude to stare.

1790
01:20:31,890 --> 01:20:33,416
-Caught that one myself.
-[Prowler] I slipped.

1791
01:20:33,441 --> 01:20:35,164
-[Gwen] <i>You?</i> Okay, <i>I</i> did all the work.

1792
01:20:35,189 --> 01:20:36,706
-You...
-How many missions have you been on together?

1793
01:20:36,731 --> 01:20:38,014
-[Gwen] Oh, not that many.
-[Hobie] Couple dozen.

1794
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:39,480
[sarcastically] That's cool.

1795
01:20:39,505 --> 01:20:40,340
-[Margo grunts]
-Sorry.

1796
01:20:42,828 --> 01:20:43,748
I'm Spiderman.

1797
01:20:43,773 --> 01:20:45,069
Wow, no way!

1798
01:20:45,094 --> 01:20:46,010
All of us are.

1799
01:20:46,035 --> 01:20:47,460
Can we just keep moving?

1800
01:20:47,485 --> 01:20:48,378
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1801
01:20:48,403 --> 01:20:49,200
What are you?

1802
01:20:49,225 --> 01:20:50,340
I'm an avatar!

1803
01:20:50,948 --> 01:20:55,066
My body is back in my parents' dimension, chilling in my game chair, and eating Fritos.

1804
01:20:55,091 --> 01:20:57,167
-[someone distant] Surprising! You don't listen!

1805
01:20:57,192 --> 01:20:58,797
Here is...better.

1806
01:20:58,822 --> 01:20:59,863
Hear that.

1807
01:21:02,407 --> 01:21:03,785
What does <i>that</i> do?

1808
01:21:03,810 --> 01:21:05,179
Apart from having a great name?

1809
01:21:05,204 --> 01:21:06,046
Go Home Machine.

1810
01:21:06,071 --> 01:21:07,173
What'd I say, eh?

1811
01:21:07,198 --> 01:21:08,038
I voted against it.

1812
01:21:08,398 --> 01:21:11,018
-[Margo] It detects whatever dimension your DNA is from,

1813
01:21:11,043 --> 01:21:12,649
and sends you there.

1814
01:21:12,977 --> 01:21:15,116
Super humane, and <i>not</i> creepy.

1815
01:21:15,350 --> 01:21:16,263
[screaming]

1816
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:18,171
-See you, guy! Don't come back!

1817
01:21:20,690 --> 01:21:22,034
We should go. We don't wanna keep Miguel...

1818
01:21:22,059 --> 01:21:23,432
I'll...s-see you around?

1819
01:21:23,457 --> 01:21:24,169
Let's go!

1820
01:21:24,194 --> 01:21:25,689
-Hey, good luck out there, man.
-Whoa! Whoa.

1821
01:21:25,714 --> 01:21:26,662
Okay, bye!

1822
01:21:26,687 --> 01:21:27,920
-[Lyla] Miguel sounds hangry.

1823
01:21:27,945 --> 01:21:30,070
-[Jess] He likes those empanadas from the cafeteria.

1824
01:21:33,153 --> 01:21:34,893
My name is Miguel O'Hara.

1825
01:21:37,255 --> 01:21:39,855
I'm this dimension's one and only Spiderman.

1826
01:21:42,215 --> 01:21:43,328
Or, at least I was.

1827
01:21:47,020 --> 01:21:48,567
But I'm not like the others.

1828
01:21:51,232 --> 01:21:53,585
I don't always like what I have to do.

1829
01:21:54,660 --> 01:21:56,567
But I know I have to be the one to do it.

1830
01:21:58,243 --> 01:22:00,610
I've given up too much to stop now.

1831
01:22:03,384 --> 01:22:04,804
[whispering] Hoo, yo!

1832
01:22:06,055 --> 01:22:07,591
Bet this doesn't even do anything.

1833
01:22:07,616 --> 01:22:10,022
Maybe it did, before you ripped it out of a wall!

1834
01:22:10,054 --> 01:22:11,635
Propaganda, bro.

1835
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:13,132
It'll distract you from the truth.

1836
01:22:13,157 --> 01:22:14,821
[sighs] And what's that?

1837
01:22:15,087 --> 01:22:16,280
I ain't got a Scooby Doo, mate.

1838
01:22:16,611 --> 01:22:17,778
'Cuz that's what they want.

1839
01:22:22,927 --> 01:22:24,567
-[Hobie] Why do you wanna be a part of this stuff?

1840
01:22:24,895 --> 01:22:26,349
-[Miles] To get a watch.

1841
01:22:26,374 --> 01:22:27,297
Make your own watch.

1842
01:22:27,322 --> 01:22:28,370
Pshh.

1843
01:22:28,395 --> 01:22:30,630
Bet you--bet you got a nice setup, huh? Nice parents?

1844
01:22:30,655 --> 01:22:31,445
They're fine.

1845
01:22:32,027 --> 01:22:33,713
I mean, we got in a fight, but...

1846
01:22:34,959 --> 01:22:37,072
they just want what's best for me. So...

1847
01:22:37,370 --> 01:22:38,296
That's a bloody shame.

1848
01:22:39,122 --> 01:22:39,989
Why?

1849
01:22:41,204 --> 01:22:42,991
'Cuz you're not ready for everybody else.

1850
01:22:51,952 --> 01:22:52,545
[recording] Get down.

1851
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:56,320
-[Hobie] Listen to me, bruv.

1852
01:22:57,248 --> 01:22:59,248
-The whole point of being Spiderman is your independence.

1853
01:22:59,273 --> 01:23:01,161
Being your own boss, you don't need all this!

1854
01:23:01,186 --> 01:23:02,316
Then why are <i>you</i> here?

1855
01:23:03,220 --> 01:23:04,552
Looking out for my drummer, is all.

1856
01:23:04,577 --> 01:23:05,926
I <i>want</i> to be in a band.

1857
01:23:05,951 --> 01:23:08,281
I...I wanna see my friends, and...

1858
01:23:08,306 --> 01:23:09,787
I need a watch to do that.

1859
01:23:09,812 --> 01:23:11,544
Guys, come on.

1860
01:23:11,569 --> 01:23:13,470
Alright. Squashed.

1861
01:23:14,507 --> 01:23:16,747
Just don't enlist until you know about who you're fighting.

1862
01:23:40,026 --> 01:23:41,319
[whispering] Yeah, I know. It's slow.

1863
01:23:42,070 --> 01:23:43,563
But...it's his thing.

1864
01:23:45,076 --> 01:23:46,449
Miguel O'Hara?

1865
01:23:46,474 --> 01:23:48,297
-Meet Miles Morales.
-[laughs]

1866
01:23:48,322 --> 01:23:50,097
Hey! <i>¿Qué tal, tío?</i>

1867
01:23:50,668 --> 01:23:51,971
I speak Spanish.

1868
01:23:53,082 --> 01:23:55,215
<i>Te traje una empanada-</i>

1869
01:23:56,398 --> 01:23:57,285
<i>Qué maravilla.</i>

1870
01:24:01,175 --> 01:24:03,661
-That's not--I'm really excited to get going. I got some...
-Oh? Great.

1871
01:24:03,686 --> 01:24:05,432
fresh new ideas on how to catch the Spot.

1872
01:24:05,457 --> 01:24:07,440
-He just wants to be taken seriously.
-Oh, wow! Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

1873
01:24:08,317 --> 01:24:08,849
Whoa!

1874
01:24:09,105 --> 01:24:10,849
He's worried about Spot.

1875
01:24:10,874 --> 01:24:12,232
I'll worry about Spot!

1876
01:24:12,257 --> 01:24:12,937
What did I do?

1877
01:24:12,961 --> 01:24:14,948
Miguel! It's not his fault!

1878
01:24:14,973 --> 01:24:16,179
Fault? Hold up.

1879
01:24:16,204 --> 01:24:17,634
You blew another hole in the multiverse!

1880
01:24:17,659 --> 01:24:18,978
He doesn't know any better!

1881
01:24:19,003 --> 01:24:20,798
I do know--what...uhh, not know...

1882
01:24:20,823 --> 01:24:22,450
But <i>you did,</i> Gwen.

1883
01:24:23,191 --> 01:24:24,098
And <i>you...</i>

1884
01:24:25,098 --> 01:24:26,486
I was gonna try and ignore you.

1885
01:24:26,511 --> 01:24:28,165
-I just can't, with you.
-I'm not even here.

1886
01:24:29,169 --> 01:24:30,042
Not really.

1887
01:24:30,380 --> 01:24:31,227
What's happening?

1888
01:24:31,252 --> 01:24:32,633
-[Peter] Hey, Miguel!

1889
01:24:32,891 --> 01:24:35,131
Come on, go easy on the kid.

1890
01:24:35,529 --> 01:24:37,815
He had a terrible teacher!

1891
01:24:39,088 --> 01:24:40,388
[laughing] He had no chance!

1892
01:24:40,413 --> 01:24:42,302
-Peter!
-Peter?
-[sarcastically] Oh boy!

1893
01:24:42,327 --> 01:24:44,925
Humbling reality Spiderman has arrived.

1894
01:24:44,950 --> 01:24:46,401
-Miles!
-Dude!

1895
01:24:46,426 --> 01:24:47,933
Don't be afraid of my friend Miguel,

1896
01:24:47,957 --> 01:24:50,005
he just looks scary. He's got no bite.

1897
01:24:50,030 --> 01:24:50,784
[quiet groan] <i>Peter.</i>

1898
01:24:50,809 --> 01:24:52,737
-You're growing up on me! You look great!

1899
01:24:52,762 --> 01:24:53,902
Ehh...

1900
01:24:53,927 --> 01:24:56,436
-You look solid. Y'know? You look good. [laughs]
-Define <i>solid</i>.

1901
01:24:56,461 --> 01:24:58,418
What happened? You bleeding from the armpits?

1902
01:24:58,443 --> 01:25:01,093
-Peter, you-
-Don't worry about the suit. We'll get you a new suit.

1903
01:25:01,118 --> 01:25:02,777
Peter, you gotta tell him...

1904
01:25:02,802 --> 01:25:03,564
Wait...

1905
01:25:03,589 --> 01:25:04,775
-What is that?
-[squealing]

1906
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:05,408
-[Peter] Mayday!

1907
01:25:05,433 --> 01:25:07,790
-You have a baby! This is crazy!
-I have a baby.

1908
01:25:07,815 --> 01:25:10,215
-[babbling]
-Don't forget to keep your little day pass on, honey!

1909
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:11,130
Oh, you have one, too.

1910
01:25:11,155 --> 01:25:12,898
I didn't know they made those for adults.

1911
01:25:12,923 --> 01:25:14,519
-Gimme a second. Mayday!
-[Mayday laughing]

1912
01:25:14,544 --> 01:25:16,136
Kid's an anarchist.

1913
01:25:16,161 --> 01:25:18,999
-[squealing]
-[baby talk] I'm coming up to get you! Here I come!

1914
01:25:19,024 --> 01:25:21,082
[muttering in Spanish]

1915
01:25:21,107 --> 01:25:23,883
[Peter] Ha! I knew I was gonna regret making her that web shooter.

1916
01:25:23,908 --> 01:25:25,998
I shouldn't have done it. That's an actual mistake.

1917
01:25:26,023 --> 01:25:27,150
[Mayday squeals]

1918
01:25:27,175 --> 01:25:27,893
Wanna see pictures?

1919
01:25:27,918 --> 01:25:29,279
-I mean, she's right there, so...
-Look at this pic!

1920
01:25:29,304 --> 01:25:32,660
-Oh! You've got...okay, uh, wow.
-Look at this special kid! [laughs] Oh, she's incredible!
-Mm-hmm.

1921
01:25:32,685 --> 01:25:34,023
-Yup.
-This is her funny face.
-Mm-hmm.

1922
01:25:34,048 --> 01:25:35,703
Oh, that's her mad face.

1923
01:25:35,728 --> 01:25:37,507
This one is the studious one.

1924
01:25:37,532 --> 01:25:40,069
Watch out, the next one, you're gonna crack up! You're gonna crack up.

1925
01:25:40,094 --> 01:25:42,029
Oh, Miguel's gonna die. [laughing]

1926
01:25:42,054 --> 01:25:43,343
Miguel! Miguel, look at this one.

1927
01:25:43,368 --> 01:25:45,457
I'm trying to hold a serious adult conversation, here.

1928
01:25:45,482 --> 01:25:47,296
You know, you're the only Spiderman who isn't funny.

1929
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:48,631
We're supposed to be funny!

1930
01:25:48,656 --> 01:25:49,941
The fate of the multiverse...

1931
01:25:49,966 --> 01:25:51,621
You always lose me with that!

1932
01:25:51,646 --> 01:25:54,109
You say, [gruffly] <i>"the fate of the multiverse"</i>,

1933
01:25:54,134 --> 01:25:55,954
-and my brain dies!
-[Mayday cooing]

1934
01:25:55,979 --> 01:25:57,385
We are--[sniffing]

1935
01:25:57,410 --> 01:25:59,255
You guys smell that? Mayday took a crap.

1936
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:00,449
-[Mayday babbling]
-Yup! She's a Parker.

1937
01:26:00,474 --> 01:26:02,299
-That's what happens when a Parker eats an avocado.
-[Miguel] Miles.

1938
01:26:02,324 --> 01:26:03,874
You disrupted a canon event.

1939
01:26:03,899 --> 01:26:04,632
Canon event?

1940
01:26:04,657 --> 01:26:06,193
The kid wasn't thinking!

1941
01:26:06,218 --> 01:26:07,680
That's not how he works!

1942
01:26:07,705 --> 01:26:08,759
That's insulting.

1943
01:26:08,784 --> 01:26:11,157
Taking a crap on the establishment. I salute you.

1944
01:26:11,182 --> 01:26:12,918
Wait, what are you upset about?

1945
01:26:12,943 --> 01:26:14,358
I saved those people.

1946
01:26:14,383 --> 01:26:15,495
And that's the problem.

1947
01:26:17,380 --> 01:26:19,193
Lyla? Do the thing.

1948
01:26:19,218 --> 01:26:20,538
Huh? What thing?

1949
01:26:20,563 --> 01:26:21,533
What--what do you mean, "what thing"?

1950
01:26:21,557 --> 01:26:23,453
The information explaining thing!

1951
01:26:23,478 --> 01:26:24,300
...Okay.

1952
01:26:30,848 --> 01:26:32,122
What's this?

1953
01:26:33,086 --> 01:26:35,346
This...is everything.

1954
01:26:41,090 --> 01:26:42,964
Can you be more specific?

1955
01:26:42,989 --> 01:26:45,311
Can you not talk for a second?

1956
01:26:45,336 --> 01:26:46,057
Yeah, yeah.

1957
01:26:47,198 --> 01:26:48,558
This, here...

1958
01:26:49,907 --> 01:26:51,293
This is all of us.

1959
01:26:51,859 --> 01:26:55,005
All of our lives woven together,

1960
01:26:55,030 --> 01:26:58,277
in a beautiful web of life and destiny.

1961
01:26:59,098 --> 01:27:00,545
The Spiderverse.

1962
01:27:00,570 --> 01:27:01,533
The Spiderverse?

1963
01:27:02,088 --> 01:27:03,389
Huh, that's...

1964
01:27:03,413 --> 01:27:04,174
stupid.

1965
01:27:04,968 --> 01:27:07,402
It's called the Arachno-Humanoid Poly-Multiverse.

1966
01:27:08,599 --> 01:27:09,546
Which sounds...

1967
01:27:10,215 --> 01:27:11,448
stupid too, I guess.

1968
01:27:12,809 --> 01:27:15,609
And these nodes, where the minds converge?

1969
01:27:16,187 --> 01:27:17,547
-They are the canon.

1970
01:27:18,142 --> 01:27:22,409
-Chapters that are a part of every Spider's story, every time.

1971
01:27:23,171 --> 01:27:24,598
Some good...

1972
01:27:25,804 --> 01:27:26,758
some bad...

1973
01:27:29,326 --> 01:27:30,440
some <i>very</i> bad.

1974
01:27:38,524 --> 01:27:39,761
Just keep going.

1975
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:41,307
Uncle Aaron...

1976
01:27:42,194 --> 01:27:45,141
This one, event ASM-90,

1977
01:27:45,892 --> 01:27:48,639
a police captain close to Spiderman dies

1978
01:27:48,664 --> 01:27:52,461
saving a kid from falling rubble during a battle with an arch-nemesis.

1979
01:27:53,387 --> 01:27:54,461
Captain Stacy...

1980
01:27:55,792 --> 01:27:56,819
I'm so sorry.

1981
01:28:20,398 --> 01:28:22,124
That happened to you?

1982
01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:25,115
And me.

1983
01:28:29,037 --> 01:28:30,491
Eh? What of it?

1984
01:28:31,285 --> 01:28:33,578
-[Miguel] That's how the story's supposed to go.

1985
01:28:34,793 --> 01:28:37,020
The canon events are the connections

1986
01:28:37,045 --> 01:28:39,285
that bind our lives together.

1987
01:28:39,969 --> 01:28:42,389
And those connections can be broken.

1988
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:46,268
That's why <i>anomalies...</i>

1989
01:28:47,088 --> 01:28:48,241
are so dangerous.

1990
01:28:49,310 --> 01:28:51,976
Inspector Singh's death was a canon event.

1991
01:28:52,001 --> 01:28:54,135
<i>You</i> weren't supposed to be there,

1992
01:28:54,160 --> 01:28:56,576
and <i>you</i> weren't supposed to save him.

1993
01:28:57,171 --> 01:28:58,762
That's why Gwen tried to stop you.

1994
01:28:59,160 --> 01:28:59,933
-Miles!

1995
01:29:00,226 --> 01:29:02,020
I thought you were trying to save me.

1996
01:29:03,917 --> 01:29:05,531
I was. I...

1997
01:29:06,932 --> 01:29:08,246
I was doing both.

1998
01:29:09,033 --> 01:29:10,886
-[Miguel] And now, Miles,

1999
01:29:11,418 --> 01:29:13,652
because you changed the story,

2000
01:29:13,677 --> 01:29:16,087
Pavitr's dimension is unraveling.

2001
01:29:16,995 --> 01:29:19,554
If we're lucky...we can stop it.

2002
01:29:21,340 --> 01:29:22,867
We haven't always been lucky.

2003
01:29:22,892 --> 01:29:24,294
That--that wasn't <i>me.</i>

2004
01:29:24,319 --> 01:29:25,341
That was the Spot!

2005
01:29:25,366 --> 01:29:27,756
It's what happens when you break the canon.

2006
01:29:30,344 --> 01:29:31,291
How do you know?

2007
01:29:32,296 --> 01:29:34,390
Because I broke it once myself.

2008
01:29:35,429 --> 01:29:38,349
I found another world where I had a family.

2009
01:29:39,085 --> 01:29:40,338
Where I was happy.

2010
01:29:41,513 --> 01:29:43,320
At least, a version of me was.

2011
01:29:44,751 --> 01:29:47,591
And that version of myself was killed.

2012
01:29:52,822 --> 01:29:54,675
So I replaced him.

2013
01:29:57,473 --> 01:29:59,313
I thought it was harmless.

2014
01:30:02,908 --> 01:30:04,035
But I was wrong.

2015
01:30:14,408 --> 01:30:16,180
Dad! Dad, help!

2016
01:30:21,307 --> 01:30:22,507
-Isn't that right, Peter?

2017
01:30:23,769 --> 01:30:24,636
Yeah.

2018
01:30:25,709 --> 01:30:28,836
You break enough canon, you save enough captains,

2019
01:30:30,543 --> 01:30:32,743
and we could lose everything.

2020
01:30:44,794 --> 01:30:46,907
My dad is about to be captain.

2021
01:30:56,330 --> 01:30:57,143
No...

2022
01:30:59,690 --> 01:31:01,784
[Spot] I'm going to take everything from you,

2023
01:31:03,645 --> 01:31:05,227
-[child] Help!
-like you took everything from me.

2024
01:31:05,252 --> 01:31:06,227
I'm coming!

2025
01:31:08,964 --> 01:31:10,751
[panting]

2026
01:31:10,776 --> 01:31:12,212
Spot does it.

2027
01:31:14,141 --> 01:31:15,301
<i>He</i> kills him.

2028
01:31:21,727 --> 01:31:23,987
When does it happen?

2029
01:31:27,417 --> 01:31:28,339
When does it happen?

2030
01:31:28,364 --> 01:31:29,572
In two days.

2031
01:31:30,713 --> 01:31:32,019
When he's sworn in.

2032
01:31:33,183 --> 01:31:35,043
That's...what the model says.

2033
01:31:37,186 --> 01:31:38,511
-I'm sorry, Miles.

2034
01:31:38,536 --> 01:31:39,542
Send me home!

2035
01:31:40,316 --> 01:31:41,263
I can't do that.

2036
01:31:41,638 --> 01:31:42,671
-Not now.

2037
01:31:43,078 --> 01:31:45,371
What am I supposed to do? Just let him die?!

2038
01:31:49,841 --> 01:31:51,081
What about <i>your</i> dad?

2039
01:31:51,445 --> 01:31:52,952
He's a captain. Right?

2040
01:31:55,351 --> 01:31:55,980
Yeah.

2041
01:31:56,841 --> 01:31:58,042
And that's it?

2042
01:31:58,066 --> 01:31:59,581
You just aren't gonna do anything about it?

2043
01:32:02,796 --> 01:32:04,615
Okay, what about Uncle Ben?

2044
01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:06,320
That'd've been okay, if you knew,

2045
01:32:06,345 --> 01:32:08,697
and you just...let it play out?!

2046
01:32:09,348 --> 01:32:11,780
If not for Uncle Ben,

2047
01:32:11,805 --> 01:32:14,525
most of us wouldn't be here, Miles.

2048
01:32:15,667 --> 01:32:17,601
And all the good we did, it...

2049
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:19,773
it wouldn't have been done.

2050
01:32:23,062 --> 01:32:25,395
So we're just supposed to let people die,

2051
01:32:25,420 --> 01:32:27,244
-because some <i>algorithm,</i>
-Oh! Whoa!

2052
01:32:27,269 --> 01:32:29,039
says that that's supposed to happen?

2053
01:32:29,064 --> 01:32:31,709
You realize how messed up that sounds, right?

2054
01:32:31,734 --> 01:32:34,868
You have a choice between saving one person

2055
01:32:34,893 --> 01:32:36,860
and saving an <i>entire world.</i>

2056
01:32:36,885 --> 01:32:37,762
Every world!

2057
01:32:37,787 --> 01:32:38,962
I can do <i>both!</i>

2058
01:32:38,987 --> 01:32:41,501
-Spiderman always-
-[Peter] Not always.

2059
01:32:45,248 --> 01:32:45,934
Miles.

2060
01:32:45,959 --> 01:32:48,295
-We all want to live the life we wish we had.

2061
01:32:49,012 --> 01:32:51,503
Believe me, I have tried.

2062
01:32:51,528 --> 01:32:53,571
And the harder I tried,

2063
01:32:53,596 --> 01:32:55,329
the more damage I did.

2064
01:32:56,983 --> 01:32:58,290
You can't have it all, kid.

2065
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:05,237
Being Spiderman is a sacrifice.

2066
01:33:05,898 --> 01:33:06,864
That's the job.

2067
01:33:07,635 --> 01:33:09,128
That's what you signed up for.

2068
01:33:10,104 --> 01:33:11,031
-[Peni] Miles...

2069
01:33:13,685 --> 01:33:14,484
-[Miles] Peni?

2070
01:33:16,282 --> 01:33:17,222
What is this?

2071
01:33:18,785 --> 01:33:20,639
Is this an intervention or something?

2072
01:33:21,453 --> 01:33:22,373
We know it's hard.

2073
01:33:23,905 --> 01:33:25,112
But it's the truth, Miles.

2074
01:33:26,008 --> 01:33:27,155
Is <i>that</i> why you're here?

2075
01:33:28,158 --> 01:33:29,491
To let me down easy?

2076
01:33:32,105 --> 01:33:34,079
-Worked last time, why not run it back, huh?

2077
01:33:34,104 --> 01:33:36,211
-Hey, hold on, hold on!
-You were right, Gwen.

2078
01:33:36,866 --> 01:33:38,905
-You should've never come to see me.

2079
01:33:38,930 --> 01:33:40,957
-Kid, look at me.
-Stop calling me that.

2080
01:33:40,982 --> 01:33:41,484
Here we go.

2081
01:33:41,509 --> 01:33:42,564
Hobie, you're not helping.

2082
01:33:42,589 --> 01:33:43,051
Good.

2083
01:33:43,842 --> 01:33:45,042
Miles, please understand...

2084
01:33:45,067 --> 01:33:47,154
You can't ask me not to save my father.

2085
01:33:47,631 --> 01:33:48,617
I'm not asking.

2086
01:33:49,163 --> 01:33:50,888
-[Peter] I got this, just--give him a second, <i>please.</i>

2087
01:33:50,915 --> 01:33:52,242
-[Hobie sarcastically] That's a great look.
-[Gwen] Don't!

2088
01:33:52,267 --> 01:33:53,119
-[Peter and Miguel arguing]

2089
01:33:53,144 --> 01:33:54,252
Stop it!

2090
01:33:54,277 --> 01:33:56,432
You let him leave, he'll only do more damage.

2091
01:33:56,457 --> 01:33:57,635
-You both know that.
-[others arguing]

2092
01:33:58,609 --> 01:34:00,095
-[Miguel] Just need to hold you a few days.
-[Hobie silent]

2093
01:34:00,486 --> 01:34:02,266
Sorry it had to end like this, kid.

2094
01:34:02,851 --> 01:34:04,105
I said...

2095
01:34:04,130 --> 01:34:05,650
not to call me that!

2096
01:34:17,888 --> 01:34:18,701
<i>Miles!</i>

2097
01:34:19,767 --> 01:34:22,145
Alright. I'm sorry for doing this.

2098
01:34:22,170 --> 01:34:23,745
This is bad parenting!

2099
01:34:24,534 --> 01:34:25,981
This is where I reckon I quit.

2100
01:34:31,223 --> 01:34:33,240
-[Miguel] All stations, drop what you're doing

2101
01:34:33,264 --> 01:34:34,509
and stop Spiderman!

2102
01:34:35,618 --> 01:34:36,098
[all] You?

2103
01:34:36,123 --> 01:34:37,623
[all confused]

2104
01:34:39,118 --> 01:34:41,030
<i>Por Dios!</i> Miles! Miles Morales!

2105
01:34:41,055 --> 01:34:42,458
He's entering Sector 4!

2106
01:34:46,655 --> 01:34:47,535
[whispering] Is that him? Right?

2107
01:34:47,560 --> 01:34:50,254
Do I, uhh...have web on my face? What's the deal?

2108
01:34:50,279 --> 01:34:52,086
-[Miguel] Miles! Lord--he's right there! He's right--

2109
01:34:52,111 --> 01:34:53,500
<i>Turn around!</i>

2110
01:34:53,525 --> 01:34:54,466

01:43:35,454 --> 01:43:36,559
Who decides that?!

2290
01:43:37,198 --> 01:43:38,785
I'm not a kid, Gwen!

2291
01:43:38,810 --> 01:43:39,501
<i>Ah!</i>

2292
01:43:39,526 --> 01:43:41,213
That's <i>exactly</i> what you are!

2293
01:43:41,238 --> 01:43:42,509
You're just a kid!

2294
01:43:42,534 --> 01:43:44,792
Who has <i>no idea</i>

2295
01:43:44,817 --> 01:43:46,251
what he's doing!

2296
01:43:48,203 --> 01:43:49,695
[grunts]

2297
01:43:51,723 --> 01:43:52,937
Yeah, well...

2298
01:43:52,962 --> 01:43:56,338
I <i>did</i> lure hundreds of Spiderpeople away from your little clubhouse.

2299
01:43:56,363 --> 01:43:56,736
Huh?

2300
01:43:57,190 --> 01:43:58,596
[spiderpeople shouting]

2301
01:44:02,833 --> 01:44:04,487
I guess he <i>did</i> plan this out!

2302
01:44:06,160 --> 01:44:07,209
And...

2303
01:44:07,234 --> 01:44:08,741
I'm about to do this.

2304
01:44:11,275 --> 01:44:13,787
[Miguel panicking]

2305
01:44:13,812 --> 01:44:18,006
Everyone keeps telling me how <i>my story</i> is supposed to go.

2306
01:44:18,918 --> 01:44:19,658
Nah.

2307
01:44:20,129 --> 01:44:21,553
Imma do my own thing.

2308
01:44:22,293 --> 01:44:23,448
Sorry, man.

2309
01:44:23,473 --> 01:44:24,373
I'm going home.

2310
01:44:24,718 --> 01:44:26,651
[screaming]

2311
01:44:41,186 --> 01:44:42,093
Goodbye, Gwen.

2312
01:44:45,997 --> 01:44:46,803
Miles!

2313
01:44:51,276 --> 01:44:53,376
I taught him how to do that, so...

2314
01:44:53,401 --> 01:44:55,881
I gotta be a pretty good mentor, to pull that off!

2315
01:45:06,774 --> 01:45:07,274
Nope.

2316
01:45:07,931 --> 01:45:08,614
No.

2317
01:45:09,102 --> 01:45:09,816
Uh-uh.

2318
01:45:10,049 --> 01:45:11,229
That's kinda cute.

2319
01:45:11,254 --> 01:45:12,210
<i>Oh,</i> no. No...

2320
01:45:13,761 --> 01:45:14,461
[hissing] Ah!

2321
01:45:15,538 --> 01:45:16,038
Huh?

2322
01:45:23,264 --> 01:45:23,997
Hmm...

2323
01:45:32,854 --> 01:45:35,556
[beeping]

2324
01:45:35,581 --> 01:45:36,041
Wha...?

2325
01:45:37,329 --> 01:45:39,282
[Computer] Initializing Go Home Machine.

2326
01:45:52,494 --> 01:45:54,447
Retinal signature identified.

2327
01:46:04,847 --> 01:46:05,716
Come on...!

2328
01:46:05,741 --> 01:46:07,140
[distorted] No!

2329
01:46:07,165 --> 01:46:09,338
No...no...<i>no!</i>

2330
01:46:15,349 --> 01:46:16,789
What's happening?

2331
01:46:16,814 --> 01:46:18,574
The machine activated on its own!

2332
01:46:18,599 --> 01:46:19,444
How's that possible?

2333
01:46:19,469 --> 01:46:20,151
It isn't!

2334
01:46:20,176 --> 01:46:22,441
[Lyla and Margo talking indistinctly]

2335
01:46:28,068 --> 01:46:28,681
How 'bout this?

2336
01:46:28,706 --> 01:46:30,033
-No, no, no, no! <i>Ugh!</i>
-Hey, how 'bout now?

2337
01:46:30,058 --> 01:46:31,167
You're getting in the way!

2338
01:46:48,905 --> 01:46:49,872
Stop him!

2339
01:46:49,897 --> 01:46:50,545
<i>Now!</i>

2340
01:46:50,785 --> 01:46:52,585
Man, what does it look like I'm trying to do?!

2341
01:46:54,406 --> 01:46:54,966
[grunts]

2342
01:46:56,776 --> 01:46:57,748

[grunting]

2344
01:47:01,644 --> 01:47:02,891
Do something!

2345
01:47:03,243 --> 01:47:03,963
-<i>Now!</i>

2346
01:47:06,900 --> 01:47:07,647
-[Peter] Miguel!

2347
01:47:07,947 --> 01:47:08,794
-[Gwen] Stop!

2348
01:47:10,416 --> 01:47:11,070
[grunts]

2349
01:47:13,132 --> 01:47:14,978
[straining]

2350
01:47:36,704 --> 01:47:37,551
<i>No!</i>

2351
01:47:50,160 --> 01:47:51,367
[roars]

2352
01:47:51,392 --> 01:47:54,285
O--okay, enough! It's not the console's fault.

2353
01:47:54,310 --> 01:47:56,205
All he had to do was <i>listen!</i>

2354
01:47:57,238 --> 01:47:58,225
Why didn't he <i>listen?</i>

2355
01:47:58,250 --> 01:47:59,701
[sarcastically] Maybe, you weren't hard enough on him!

2356
01:47:59,726 --> 01:48:00,693
[Jess quietly] Gwen, don't do it.

2357
01:48:00,718 --> 01:48:01,713
You let him go.

2358
01:48:02,180 --> 01:48:03,133
-Me?
-You didn't catch him,

2359
01:48:03,158 --> 01:48:05,906
-<i>Gwen.</i>
-Okay, let's all just take a breath...
-Peter!

2360
01:48:05,931 --> 01:48:06,764
You wanna back me up?!

2361
01:48:06,789 --> 01:48:08,108
Well, okay. Miguel?

2362
01:48:08,133 --> 01:48:10,028
As a father of a daughter, and

2363
01:48:10,053 --> 01:48:11,260
the son of a mother...

2364
01:48:11,285 --> 01:48:12,460
Yeah, actually, stop talking.

2365
01:48:12,485 --> 01:48:13,593
Okay, duly noted.

2366
01:48:13,618 --> 01:48:14,949
Let me just <i>talk</i> to him.

2367
01:48:16,497 --> 01:48:17,511
We tried that.

2368
01:48:17,536 --> 01:48:18,604
He's my <i>friend.</i>

2369
01:48:18,629 --> 01:48:19,712
Yeah, and that's the problem.

2370
01:48:19,737 --> 01:48:22,534
Do you know for certain what happens if he breaks the canon?

2371
01:48:24,091 --> 01:48:25,405
You wanna find out?

2372
01:48:25,992 --> 01:48:27,772
I told you she was a liability!

2373
01:48:29,118 --> 01:48:30,085
You're wrong.

2374
01:48:30,825 --> 01:48:31,752
Jess?

2375
01:48:31,777 --> 01:48:33,078
Tell him he's wrong.

2376
01:48:34,504 --> 01:48:35,716
He's...not.

2377
01:48:35,741 --> 01:48:37,535
Are you serious right now?

2378
01:48:37,560 --> 01:48:38,774
I told you.

2379
01:48:38,799 --> 01:48:40,433
You let him get away,

2380
01:48:40,458 --> 01:48:41,573
I can't help you.

2381
01:48:42,115 --> 01:48:43,731
I'm not coming.

2382
01:48:43,756 --> 01:48:44,529
You're right.

2383
01:48:45,204 --> 01:48:45,784
What?

2384
01:48:47,464 --> 01:48:48,457
What the hell?!

2385
01:48:58,629 --> 01:48:59,949
Go home, Gwen.

2386
01:49:05,574 --> 01:49:07,840
We are supposed to be the good guys.

2387
01:49:24,162 --> 01:49:25,142
We are.

2388
01:49:28,503 --> 01:49:29,417
We are.

2389
01:49:31,326 --> 01:49:32,703
Jess. Ben.

2390
01:49:32,728 --> 01:49:33,637
Come with me.

2391
01:49:33,662 --> 01:49:34,692
Hell yeah!

2392
01:49:34,717 --> 01:49:36,511
[Miguel] Somebody catch Spot.

2393
01:49:36,536 --> 01:49:37,783
[Peter] Yeah, sorry. I, uhh...

2394
01:49:37,808 --> 01:49:39,406
I gotta get her down for a nap.

2395
01:49:39,431 --> 01:49:40,405
Not <i>you.</i>

2396
01:49:40,430 --> 01:49:42,196
I've had the right amount of you.

2397
01:49:44,929 --> 01:49:45,901
[blows a raspberry]

2398
01:49:45,926 --> 01:49:47,955

2403
01:50:34,899 --> 01:50:36,912
-How was work?
-[Peter sighs]

2404
01:50:36,937 --> 01:50:38,251
[muttering] I don't know.

2405
01:50:38,276 --> 01:50:38,913
Peter?

2406
01:50:39,594 --> 01:50:41,794
Did you bring our baby to another fight?

2407
01:50:41,819 --> 01:50:44,214
Did I bring our ba-? No. No--no.

2408
01:50:44,239 --> 01:50:46,911
'Cuz you asked me not to. So, I didn't. I wouldn't.

2409
01:50:46,936 --> 01:50:47,656
Mm-hmm.

[grunts]

2412
01:51:18,918 --> 01:51:20,418
You think I'll be any good at this?

2413
01:51:22,167 --> 01:51:23,473
You're asking that <i>now?</i>

2414
01:51:25,571 --> 01:51:28,211
There's no playbook for raising someone like her.

2415
01:51:29,019 --> 01:51:29,666
-Or...

2416
01:51:30,291 --> 01:51:32,151
being someone like you.

2417
01:51:36,218 --> 01:51:38,780
You just gotta...make the right adjustments at halftime.

2418
01:51:44,004 --> 01:51:46,390
-That's a sports metaphor, by the way.
-I understand.

2419
01:51:46,415 --> 01:51:47,333
[laughs] Wow, sorry.

2420
01:51:47,358 --> 01:51:49,343
You were just such a nerd in high school, I figured...

2421
01:51:49,368 --> 01:51:51,440
I <i>have</i> watched sports!

2422
01:51:51,465 --> 01:51:54,124
-Ah! Okay, champ.
-Unbelievable.

2423
01:52:22,268 --> 01:52:23,548
Wanna go easy on the penguin?

2424
01:52:24,429 --> 01:52:25,569
[stammers] Just...

2425
01:52:26,835 --> 01:52:28,135
You won't even look at me?

2426
01:52:30,470 --> 01:52:31,097
What?

2427
01:52:31,580 --> 01:52:32,800
What--what is that?

2428
01:52:33,756 --> 01:52:34,629
I'm looking at you.

2429
01:52:35,149 --> 01:52:36,029
Like you asked.

2430
01:52:36,359 --> 01:52:37,073
[sighs]

2431
01:52:38,901 --> 01:52:39,841
You look skinny.

2432
01:52:41,398 --> 01:52:42,385
Where have you been?

2433
01:52:42,741 --> 01:52:43,948
Just been, uhh...

2434
01:52:43,973 --> 01:52:45,868
out murdering all my friends.

2435
01:52:45,893 --> 01:52:48,748
Oh. Oh, that's funny, uhh, okay. Yeah.

2436
01:52:48,773 --> 01:52:49,573
Okay.

2437
01:52:55,401 --> 01:52:56,141
Where are you going?

2438
01:52:56,166 --> 01:52:57,041
I don't know.

2439
01:53:01,759 --> 01:53:03,532
You're a good cop, Dad.

2440
01:53:04,621 --> 01:53:07,217
You know you put on that badge because you know if you don't,

2441
01:53:07,242 --> 01:53:09,182
someone who shouldn't will.

2442
01:53:10,378 --> 01:53:11,004
But...

2443
01:53:11,517 --> 01:53:13,457
you have to understand.

2444
01:53:13,482 --> 01:53:15,903
This mask is <i>my</i> badge.

2445
01:53:16,973 --> 01:53:19,811
And I'm <i>trying</i> to be good, too.

2446
01:53:20,392 --> 01:53:22,798
I was trying <i>so hard</i>

2447
01:53:22,823 --> 01:53:25,064
to wear this thing the way you would want!

2448
01:53:25,880 --> 01:53:27,253
And I didn't.

2449
01:53:27,903 --> 01:53:28,649
I didn't!

2450
01:53:29,069 --> 01:53:30,275
I can do all these things,

2451
01:53:30,300 --> 01:53:32,887
but I can't help the people I love the most.

2452
01:53:32,912 --> 01:53:35,515
And they can only know <i>half</i> of who I am!

2453
01:53:35,540 --> 01:53:38,999
So I'm...<i>completely</i> on my own!

2454
01:53:39,024 --> 01:53:40,415
And now, I don't...

2455
01:53:40,440 --> 01:53:42,479
[voice shaking] I don't even know what the right thing is, anymore.

2456
01:53:42,504 --> 01:53:44,044
I don't know what I'm supposed to do!

2457
01:53:44,069 --> 01:53:45,231
But I know...

2458
01:53:46,561 --> 01:53:47,214
[sighs]

2459
01:53:47,239 --> 01:53:49,870
I can't lose one more friend.

2460
01:53:53,301 --> 01:53:54,229
Gwen...

2461
01:53:54,254 --> 01:53:57,021
I always taught you to do it by the book.

2462
01:53:57,046 --> 01:53:58,382
Yeah, and how did that work out?

2463
01:53:58,407 --> 01:53:59,461
I took an oath.

2464
01:53:59,486 --> 01:54:01,358
Then arrest me, Dad!

2465
01:54:02,663 --> 01:54:04,543
-Get it over with.
-I...

2466
01:54:04,568 --> 01:54:05,498
I can't.

2467
01:54:05,932 --> 01:54:06,498
Why not?

2468
01:54:07,471 --> 01:54:08,831
Because I quit.

2469
01:54:10,226 --> 01:54:10,740
When?

2470
01:54:12,341 --> 01:54:14,228
About halfway through your big speech.

2471
01:54:15,035 --> 01:54:15,795
You're...

2472
01:54:16,453 --> 01:54:18,593
Wait a minute. You're not--you're not gonna be captain?

2473
01:54:20,079 --> 01:54:21,126
That means...

2474
01:54:22,855 --> 01:54:25,328
My job...being captain...

2475
01:54:25,866 --> 01:54:26,752
This whole...

2476
01:54:27,526 --> 01:54:29,395
thing doesn't matter anymore.

2477
01:54:34,092 --> 01:54:36,078
You're the best thing I've ever done.

2478
01:54:51,809 --> 01:54:53,102
It was a good speech, huh?

2479
01:54:53,127 --> 01:54:54,499
No wonder you got an A in English.

2480
01:54:54,524 --> 01:54:56,468
B. I got a B. Plus.

2481
01:54:56,493 --> 01:54:57,569
Missed a few classes.

2482
01:54:59,647 --> 01:55:01,654
I don't know what it is you gotta do,

2483
01:55:03,589 --> 01:55:05,989
But I...I think that this thing is supposed to help.

2484
01:55:08,293 --> 01:55:10,386
The guy who left it was a real piece of work.

2485
01:55:35,325 --> 01:55:36,445
I'll be right back.

2486
01:55:38,660 --> 01:55:39,353
Promise.

2487
01:55:47,766 --> 01:55:48,652
Parenting...

2488
01:55:49,266 --> 01:55:50,252
stuff is...

2489
01:55:51,721 --> 01:55:52,868
a big-ass mystery.

2490
01:55:59,335 --> 01:56:00,295
-[Miguel] You're a <i>mistake!</i>

2491
01:56:00,746 --> 01:56:02,332
-If you hadn't been bit,

2492
01:56:02,701 --> 01:56:04,258
-Peter Parker would've lived!

2493
01:56:04,805 --> 01:56:06,578
-And <i>none of this</i> would've happened!

2494
01:56:06,892 --> 01:56:07,927
-[Peter Porker] Miles...

2495
01:56:07,952 --> 01:56:10,306
-the hardest thing about this job is...

2496
01:56:10,674 --> 01:56:12,108
-you can't always save everybody.

2497
01:56:12,133 --> 01:56:13,556
-[Spot] I'll make you pay...

2498
01:56:14,043 --> 01:56:15,738
-for everything you took away from me.

2499
01:56:15,763 --> 01:56:18,018
-[Miguel] ...the choice between saving one person,

2500
01:56:18,043 --> 01:56:20,848
-and an entire world. Every world.
-[Miles] I can do both!

2501
01:56:20,873 --> 01:56:22,115
-[Miles] Spiderman always-

2502
01:56:22,140 --> 01:56:23,265
-[Peter] Not always.

2503
01:56:23,290 --> 01:56:25,217
-[Rio] Whatever you wanna do out there,

2504
01:56:25,242 --> 01:56:26,712
-don't get lost.

2505
01:56:26,737 --> 01:56:28,944
-[Peter] Things are gonna happen.
-[Gwen] I...I didn't know...

2506
01:56:28,969 --> 01:56:31,258
-...how to tell you.
-[Miguel] You're not supposed to be Spiderman!

2507
01:56:34,288 --> 01:56:35,288
-[Aaron] Keep going.

2508
01:56:40,169 --> 01:56:40,969
<i>Ah!</i>

2509
01:56:49,571 --> 01:56:51,918
[panting and groaning]

2510
01:56:52,983 --> 01:56:54,190
Did you check your locations?

2511
01:56:54,215 --> 01:56:55,077
<i>Yes, Dad.</i>

2512
01:56:55,102 --> 01:56:55,720
No sign of him.

2513
01:56:55,745 --> 01:56:57,484
Lyla, would you just send everyone out?

2514
01:56:57,509 --> 01:56:59,560
Anywhere. Anywhere he might be!

2515
01:56:59,585 --> 01:57:01,025
[laughing] Congrats, Captain.

2516
01:57:01,050 --> 01:57:03,267
Captain? You can't call me that 'till I'm sworn in.

2517
01:57:03,292 --> 01:57:04,120
You know that.

2518
01:57:04,145 --> 01:57:05,007
We're all proud of you!

2519
01:57:33,402 --> 01:57:36,006
Perfect pose.

2520
01:57:36,031 --> 01:57:37,173
-[glitching]
-Wha...?

2521
01:57:37,198 --> 01:57:38,732
Possible disturbance in the alley.

2522
01:57:38,757 --> 01:57:40,106
Better go check it out.

2523
01:57:40,131 --> 01:57:40,781
[grunts]

2524
01:57:40,806 --> 01:57:42,371
Now, I'm here in the alley.

2525
01:57:42,985 --> 01:57:44,825
There's something unusual happening.

2526
01:57:44,850 --> 01:57:46,973
Looking at the walls--those are normal.

2527
01:57:46,998 --> 01:57:48,399
But there's something in front of me-

2528
01:57:48,424 --> 01:57:48,800
Ah!

2529
01:57:48,825 --> 01:57:50,961
<i>Ohhhh no!</i>

2530
01:58:09,376 --> 01:58:09,956
[sighs]

2531
01:58:10,749 --> 01:58:11,429
I made it.

2532
01:58:12,292 --> 01:58:13,158
I'm home.

2533
01:58:18,670 --> 01:58:19,497
-[Rio] Miles?
-[gasps]

2534
01:58:25,169 --> 01:58:26,389
Is now a bad time...?

2535
01:58:26,778 --> 01:58:28,765
-Am I--am I too late?
-What'd you do to your hair?

2536
01:58:28,790 --> 01:58:30,535
Are you guys okay? Tell me you're okay!

2537
01:58:31,663 --> 01:58:32,650
I'm okay...!

2538
01:58:33,359 --> 01:58:34,179
You were right.

2539
01:58:35,202 --> 01:58:36,455
You were right about everything.

2540
01:58:36,480 --> 01:58:37,701
Of course I'm right. I'm always right.

2541
01:58:38,485 --> 01:58:39,458
What am I right about?

2542
01:58:39,483 --> 01:58:42,292
I saw...all these amazing places!

2543
01:58:42,317 --> 01:58:44,183
And met all these amazing people!

2544
01:58:44,672 --> 01:58:45,272
But...

2545
01:58:45,297 --> 01:58:46,479
<i>¿Que te pasa, mijo?</i>

2546
01:58:46,504 --> 01:58:47,234
[sighs]

2547
01:58:48,628 --> 01:58:49,755
But they didn't want me.

2548
01:58:50,899 --> 01:58:53,093
I...I kept thinking about what you said.

2549
01:58:54,865 --> 01:58:55,932
I let 'em have it, Mom.

2550
01:58:57,744 --> 01:58:58,798
I beat 'em all.

2551
01:59:02,659 --> 01:59:04,693
I know how strong I am, now.

2552
01:59:06,117 --> 01:59:07,910
I'm strong because of you!

2553
01:59:09,068 --> 01:59:09,894
-And Dad!

2554
01:59:09,919 --> 01:59:11,092
<i>¿Que to?</i>

2555
01:59:11,558 --> 01:59:12,424
And us!

2556
01:59:15,288 --> 01:59:15,855
Mom...

2557
01:59:17,722 --> 01:59:19,189
there's something coming for us.

2558
01:59:20,890 --> 01:59:21,630
Something...

2559
01:59:22,460 --> 01:59:23,551
something terrible.

2560
01:59:23,576 --> 01:59:26,278
Miles, you're talking crazy. What's going on?

2561
01:59:26,303 --> 01:59:27,163
-His name is Spot.

2562
01:59:28,243 --> 01:59:29,523
He's my nemesis.

2563
01:59:31,059 --> 01:59:32,326
And I'm gonna stop him.

2564
01:59:38,054 --> 01:59:39,943
I know you know I've been lying to you.

2565
01:59:41,461 --> 01:59:43,728
It's because I thought if you knew...

2566
01:59:44,987 --> 01:59:46,620
you wouldn't love me the same.

2567
01:59:49,290 --> 01:59:50,983
And then I went out there, and...

2568
01:59:52,470 --> 01:59:53,336
And now...

2569
01:59:55,538 --> 01:59:56,978
I'm not afraid of anything.

2570
02:00:00,005 --> 02:00:01,138
What do you wanna tell me?

2571
02:00:01,660 --> 02:00:03,540
You gotta promise nothing's gonna change.

2572
02:00:03,565 --> 02:00:04,981
<i>Papa,</i> I will always love you.

2573
02:00:05,006 --> 02:00:05,796
You gotta promise.

2574
02:00:05,821 --> 02:00:06,838
Always.

2575
02:00:07,317 --> 02:00:08,697
I don't care <i>what</i> you say.

2576
02:00:09,827 --> 02:00:10,821
<i>¿Tú me entiendes?</i>

2577
02:00:10,846 --> 02:00:12,648
[sighs]

2578
02:00:17,995 --> 02:00:18,629
Mom...

2579
02:00:20,973 --> 02:00:21,540
I'm...

2580
02:00:23,740 --> 02:00:24,960
I'm Spiderman.

2581
02:00:36,252 --> 02:00:37,345
Who's Spiderman?

2582
02:00:39,927 --> 02:00:41,240
...The superhero?

2583
02:00:41,854 --> 02:00:43,190
He got bit by a spider?

2584
02:00:44,544 --> 02:00:46,364
Gave him spider powers?

2585
02:00:49,065 --> 02:00:49,911
He's me?

2586
02:00:54,981 --> 02:00:57,848
Is this where...like, you dress up like your favorite character?

2587
02:00:57,873 --> 02:00:59,284
Or, like, what's it called?

2588
02:00:59,309 --> 02:01:00,291
Like Comics Con!

2589
02:01:00,316 --> 02:01:01,932
I don't know what that is.

2590
02:01:01,957 --> 02:01:04,510
You really had me going there, <i>Spiderman.</i>

2591
02:01:04,535 --> 02:01:05,790
[laughing] <i>Imagínate.</i>

2592
02:01:13,713 --> 02:01:14,826
Why don't you have 8 arms?

2593
02:01:14,851 --> 02:01:15,239
Um...

2594
02:01:15,264 --> 02:01:17,073
Do you push silk out of your <i>culito?</i>

2595
02:01:17,098 --> 02:01:18,429
I had a nightmare about that once. But no!

2596
02:01:18,454 --> 02:01:19,929
Are you sure you woke up?

2597
02:01:38,721 --> 02:01:40,479
Mom! Stop playing around!

2598
02:01:40,504 --> 02:01:41,698
This is serious!

2599
02:01:41,723 --> 02:01:43,470
Dad worked with Spiderman.

2600
02:01:43,495 --> 02:01:46,460
I mean, he didn't realize Spiderman was me at the time, but...

2601
02:01:46,485 --> 02:01:49,543
-[sighs] I wish Dad was here to explain this.
-[firmly] Miles, please.

2602
02:01:53,800 --> 02:01:54,993
I got you to take care of,

2603
02:01:55,018 --> 02:01:56,238
I got me to take care of.

2604
02:01:56,823 --> 02:01:58,523
-So help me out.
-Mom, hold on! Hold on!

2605
02:01:58,548 --> 02:01:59,534
I need to talk-

2606
02:01:59,559 --> 02:02:01,556
[grunting]

2607
02:02:17,823 --> 02:02:18,463
42.

2608
02:02:25,235 --> 02:02:27,268
-[computer] Dimensional signature identified.

2609

[door unlocking]

2610
02:02:46,666 --> 02:02:47,852
Uncle Aaron?

2611
02:02:49,953 --> 02:02:50,453
Hey.

2612
02:03:02,136 --> 02:03:02,850
You okay?

2613
02:03:07,720 --> 02:03:08,660
Whoa!

2614
02:03:09,643 --> 02:03:11,176
I missed you so much.

2615
02:03:11,201 --> 02:03:12,946
[laughing] Okay.

2616
02:03:12,971 --> 02:03:14,522
Alright, then. Alright.

2617
02:03:14,547 --> 02:03:15,971
Whoa. You took your braids out?

2618
02:03:15,996 --> 02:03:16,934
Uhh...

2619
02:03:16,959 --> 02:03:18,110
-On purpose?
-Yeah.

2620
02:03:18,135 --> 02:03:20,417
Yeah, I'm still...

2621
02:03:20,442 --> 02:03:21,933
...getting used to it?

2622
02:03:22,842 --> 02:03:25,222
They gave me more hours at the hospital, so next month,

2623
02:03:25,247 --> 02:03:26,851
-I swear, I'll pay you back...
-Stop it, stop it.

2624
02:03:26,876 --> 02:03:27,969
We're family.

2625
02:03:28,842 --> 02:03:29,649
Thanks.

2626
02:03:31,398 --> 02:03:32,491
-[Rio] Hey, honey. How are you doing?

2627
02:03:32,516 --> 02:03:34,212
Hey. How'd it go with Miles?

2628
02:03:34,237 --> 02:03:35,029
-Well...

2629
02:03:35,054 --> 02:03:36,978
you know how you grounded him?

2630
02:03:37,003 --> 02:03:37,881
Mm-hmm...

2631
02:03:37,906 --> 02:03:39,035
I ungrounded him.

2632
02:03:39,060 --> 02:03:40,459
You...you what?

2633
02:03:40,484 --> 02:03:42,084
A little bit.

2634
02:03:42,109 --> 02:03:43,422
-[Rio] How much trouble could he get in tonight?

2635
02:03:43,447 --> 02:03:44,469
-A lot of trouble!

2636
02:03:44,710 --> 02:03:45,476
-I don't wanna think about it.

2637
02:03:47,139 --> 02:03:49,858
-[Rio] Oh, Miles. I have to work an overnight tonight.

2638
02:03:49,883 --> 02:03:50,920
Here's a grocery list.

2639
02:03:50,945 --> 02:03:52,631
I'll make sure he gets this done.

2640
02:03:54,194 --> 02:03:55,414
Alright. We gotta roll.

2641
02:04:00,475 --> 02:04:03,089
Security switches out at 6. That's the window, right?

2642
02:04:03,666 --> 02:04:04,921
...Right. Yep.

2643
02:04:06,019 --> 02:04:08,232
I'm...I'm following you in...

2644
02:04:08,257 --> 02:04:10,151
what you are...saying.

2645
02:04:10,176 --> 02:04:13,521

02:04:13,546 --> 02:04:14,155
[panting]

2647
02:04:14,180 --> 02:04:14,848
You alright?

2648
02:04:16,286 --> 02:04:17,740
[weakly] I have a cold.

2649
02:04:19,233 --> 02:04:20,120
C'mon, man.

2650
02:04:21,317 --> 02:04:22,529
Make sure you got the plan.

2651
02:04:23,136 --> 02:04:24,585
Yeah, but...but...

2652
02:04:24,610 --> 02:04:26,715
maybe we should go over it one more time,

2653
02:04:26,740 --> 02:04:28,874
just to make sure there's no...

2654
02:04:29,606 --> 02:04:30,459
problems.

2655
02:04:30,869 --> 02:04:32,482
[distant sirens]

2656
02:04:38,039 --> 02:04:40,152
[whispering] There's no Spiderman here.

2657
02:04:48,584 --> 02:04:49,644
-Oh, no.

2658
02:04:50,118 --> 02:04:51,031
-Dad...

2659
02:05:10,872 --> 02:05:14,270
-[Jeff] I'm sorry, baby, but you <i>did</i> unilaterally unground him.

2660
02:05:14,295 --> 02:05:15,060
-[Rio] Jeff...

2661
02:05:15,085 --> 02:05:18,690
-I just--I just worry about him getting mixed up with the wrong people, okay?

2662
02:05:18,715 --> 02:05:20,692
-This is probably that girl.

2663
02:05:20,717 --> 02:05:22,845
-What is he even thinking, being with her?

2664
02:05:22,870 --> 02:05:24,458
I have <i>some</i> ideas.

2665
02:05:24,483 --> 02:05:26,087
Baby...you're really not helping.

2666
02:05:26,112 --> 02:05:28,381
-[Rio] You saw the way he lit up around her!

2667
02:05:29,875 --> 02:05:31,415
-...I just hope she doesn't get him hurt.

2668
02:05:34,756 --> 02:05:36,802
-[Jeff] I mean, am I responsible for this?

2669
02:05:36,827 --> 02:05:37,896
-[Rio] No, no!

2670
02:05:37,921 --> 02:05:38,744
Maybe it's all my fault!

2671
02:05:38,769 --> 02:05:41,246
Come on, <i>papa,</i> you're a great dad.

2672
02:05:41,271 --> 02:05:41,757
This is all...

2673
02:05:41,782 --> 02:05:44,398
It's just...it's hard. It's like...[sighs]

2674
02:05:44,423 --> 02:05:48,118
we got a whole new kid who just wants to grow up so fast.

2675
02:05:50,078 --> 02:05:52,125
And maybe, we gotta grow up, too.

2676
02:05:53,797 --> 02:05:54,671
A little bit.

2677
02:05:55,282 --> 02:05:57,876
Maybe we just gotta let him spread his wings, man.

2678
02:05:58,529 --> 02:05:59,223
"Man"?

2679
02:06:00,038 --> 02:06:01,312
-[Gwen] It's not your fault.

2680
02:06:04,029 --> 02:06:05,062
It's mine.

2681
02:06:05,660 --> 02:06:08,129
Oh, come on. What the heck are you doing here?

2682
02:06:08,154 --> 02:06:10,707
Oh, uhh, his window was open, so I came in.

2683
02:06:10,732 --> 02:06:13,336
Because that's...normal...to do.

2684
02:06:13,361 --> 02:06:14,682
I wanna talk to your parents.

2685
02:06:14,707 --> 02:06:17,061
Right. My, uhh...my dad's kinda hard to get on the horn.

2686
02:06:17,086 --> 02:06:18,423
Oh, really? What does he do?

2687
02:06:18,448 --> 02:06:19,250
Deal drugs?

2688
02:06:19,990 --> 02:06:20,977
He's a cop.

2689
02:06:23,258 --> 02:06:24,578
Statement withdrawn.

2690
02:06:25,291 --> 02:06:26,411
Yep, well, I'm gonna call the station.

2691
02:06:26,436 --> 02:06:28,571
I don't think he's there. Or...

2692
02:06:28,596 --> 02:06:29,764
anywhere around here.

2693
02:06:29,789 --> 02:06:31,402
Well, that's his jacket, emo!

2694
02:06:31,427 --> 02:06:32,135
Where's Miles?

2695
02:06:32,160 --> 02:06:32,659
I don't know.

2696
02:06:32,684 --> 02:06:33,990
-[Jeff stammering]
-<i>You don't know?</i>

2697
02:06:34,015 --> 02:06:35,140
What do you mean, you don't know?!

2698
02:06:35,165 --> 02:06:36,747
Yeah. Umm...I'll leave.

2699
02:06:36,772 --> 02:06:38,582
Where do you think <i>you're</i> going, young lady?

2700
02:06:39,182 --> 02:06:40,489
I'm going to find him.

2701
02:06:41,909 --> 02:06:43,663
I don't know where, exactly...

2702
02:06:45,319 --> 02:06:46,673
But I know where to start.

2703
02:06:48,625 --> 02:06:50,292
One thing I learned from Miles...

2704
02:06:52,126 --> 02:06:53,526
it's all possible.

2705
02:06:56,246 --> 02:06:59,399
He loves you more than you could ever imagine.

2706
02:07:03,562 --> 02:07:04,402
I've seen it.

2707
02:07:09,946 --> 02:07:11,353
If you do find him...

2708
02:07:13,659 --> 02:07:15,445
[firmly] tell him 5 months.

2709
02:07:17,852 --> 02:07:19,585
And tell him we love him.

2710
02:07:21,426 --> 02:07:22,220
You got it.

2711
02:07:56,349 --> 02:07:57,276
Uncle Aaron...

2712
02:08:04,317 --> 02:08:05,117
-[Miles] Wait, wait.

2713
02:08:05,551 --> 02:08:06,751
-I was...listen.

2714
02:08:07,109 --> 02:08:07,916
-Okay, um...

2715
02:08:12,301 --> 02:08:13,461
-You don't understand.

2716
02:08:13,486 --> 02:08:14,586
I'm not from here.

2717
02:08:14,611 --> 02:08:15,706
[grunting]

2718
02:08:15,731 --> 02:08:17,626
I'm from an entirely different dimension.

2719
02:08:18,250 --> 02:08:19,976
Wait, wait, wait. Please, please. Please!

2720
02:08:20,001 --> 02:08:20,590
Please!

2721
02:08:21,281 --> 02:08:22,667
-I got sent here by mistake!

2722
02:08:22,692 --> 02:08:25,317
-Uncle Aaron, wait, wait, wait, wait! Uncle Aaron!

2723
02:08:40,137 --> 02:08:40,770
Please.

2724
02:08:41,331 --> 02:08:42,377
Uncle Aaron?

2725
02:08:43,496 --> 02:08:45,063
Just...hear me out.

2726
02:08:45,774 --> 02:08:46,640
[music gets louder]

2727
02:08:47,276 --> 02:08:47,996
[sighs]

2728
02:08:48,758 --> 02:08:51,284
I was bit by a spider that gave me powers.

2729
02:08:52,187 --> 02:08:53,840
It wasn't supposed to bite <i>me,</i>

2730
02:08:53,865 --> 02:08:55,830
it was supposed to bite someone else.

2731
02:08:55,855 --> 02:08:56,815
Someone from here.

2732
02:08:57,807 --> 02:08:58,727
I don't belong here.

2733
02:08:59,199 --> 02:09:00,125
I need to go home.

2734
02:09:00,644 --> 02:09:01,130
Okay?

2735
02:09:03,762 --> 02:09:06,196
I have an Uncle Aaron, too. I-I <i>had</i> one.

2736
02:09:06,764 --> 02:09:09,770
-He was a bad guy...called the Prowler.

2737
02:09:09,795 --> 02:09:12,466
-He...he looked out for me.

2738
02:09:12,491 --> 02:09:14,735
-He did a lot of bad things, but...

2739
02:09:15,589 --> 02:09:17,181
I knew he wanted to be good.

2740
02:09:17,735 --> 02:09:19,390
He just...didn't know he had a choice,

2741
02:09:19,414 --> 02:09:20,455
but you do!

2742
02:09:21,467 --> 02:09:22,934
You can be a good guy!

2743
02:09:23,340 --> 02:09:24,727
[chuckling]

2744
02:09:24,752 --> 02:09:25,787
A good guy?

2745
02:09:26,343 --> 02:09:28,330
[sighing] Please, just trust me.

2746
02:09:28,355 --> 02:09:29,852
I know you don't wanna be the Prowler.

2747
02:09:33,777 --> 02:09:35,870
[panting]

2748
02:09:42,674 --> 02:09:43,527
I'm not.

2749
02:09:57,097 --> 02:09:58,844
[Jameson indistinct on TV]

2750
02:10:22,167 --> 02:10:23,494
[distorted] Your dad is still alive?

2751
02:10:24,448 --> 02:10:25,448
...What?

2752
02:10:26,252 --> 02:10:27,225
Your father.

2753
02:10:28,163 --> 02:10:29,476
You said he's still alive.

2754
02:10:30,961 --> 02:10:31,628
Yeah.

2755
02:10:34,645 --> 02:10:35,292
Huh.

2756
02:10:37,073 --> 02:10:37,827
Who are you?

2757
02:10:47,378 --> 02:10:48,738
I'm Miles Morales.

2758
02:10:51,265 --> 02:10:52,312
But you...

2759
02:10:52,964 --> 02:10:54,604
you can call me the Prowler.

2760
02:10:56,897 --> 02:10:58,184
If I don't get home...

2761
02:10:59,837 --> 02:11:01,634
our dad...is going to die.

2762
02:11:01,659 --> 02:11:02,937
<i>Your</i> dad.

2763
02:11:05,536 --> 02:11:06,162
Please.

2764
02:11:08,348 --> 02:11:09,721
You have to let me go.

2765
02:11:15,921 --> 02:11:17,014
Why would I do that?

2766
02:12:16,929 --> 02:12:18,002
[whispering] Don't tell Mom.

2767
02:12:25,093 --> 02:12:26,993
[Gwen] I never found the right band to join.

2768
02:12:29,200 --> 02:12:30,987
So, I started my own.

2769
02:12:34,984 --> 02:12:36,157
With a few old friends.

2770
02:12:58,653 --> 02:12:59,559
Want in?
