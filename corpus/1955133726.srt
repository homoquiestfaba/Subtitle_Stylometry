National day of mourning in the Philipines,
after 44 police commanders were killed,

00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:29,620
in the line of duty when an anti-terror
operation went wrong.

00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:14,740
Philipine authorities now say the toll in yesterday's
hotel bombing has risen to 146 dead and 231 wounded

6
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:21,040
It is the most devastating terrorist attack in Asia,
in 10 years. And the worst ever, in Manila.

7
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,480
While no organization has taken
responsibility for the blast,

8
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,390
Western intelligence sources have identified

9
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:33,360
chemical traces that are the hallmark of
the infamous arms-dealer, Aarmir Barkawi

10
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:41,520
International security experts say that the Barkawi
family is now instigating violence in remote capitals

11
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:48,040
To foster instability, and thus fuel
massive arms sales around the globe.

12
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,420
- Kamran
- Raza

13
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,720
Did Philippine Intelligence track you?

14
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:34,760
Father,

15
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,010
- You did well,
- Thank you.

16
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,780
We need to discuss Major General Rahmad.

17
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,200
It's your sister's wedding.

18
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,220
I'm sorry, this can't wait.

19
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,250
I think your ISI officer was compromised.

20
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:05,460
Kamran, all Pakistani intelligence
officers are compromised.

21
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:09,730
One of our Afghani friends discovered
a German BND agent in his circle.

22
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:10,480
And?

23
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:20,140
That particular general won't be very
useful to us anymore. He's been eliminated.

24
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,420
Thought you might want to know.

25
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,760
Don't forget his family.

26
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:33,010
Vengeance must always be profound,
and absolute.

27
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:41,120
Very happy.

Everyday the same damn joke.

33
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,740
Seriously?

34
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:54,410
- What the hell your made of?
- Bourbon, and poor choices.

35
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,960
Pick a name yet?

36
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,830
Well, we were thinking Benjamin
if it was a boy.

37
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,040
- Really?
- Hell, no!!

38
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,710
If it's a girl, maybe.

39
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,230
Voight,

40
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:22,270
- Voight, you want to run over him for me?
- Believe me, sir. We've tried.

41
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,890
Baby,

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,270
babe.

What?

44
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,010
A little problem in the nursery.

45
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:54,080
Alright, so six cameras, right?

46
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:59,420
One, two, three, four, five, six.

47
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,610
- Why is that too much?
- Yeah, maybe.

48
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,570
Yeah, it's too much.
and I thought that.

49
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,610
They're baby gifts from the guys.

50
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,590
- I'll take them down.
- All we need ..

51
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:13,710
- Is one baby monitor.
- One baby monitor, right.

52
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:14,730
Okay,

53
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,210
- And a kevlar mattress.
- and a kevlar mattress..

54
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,680
Come here,

55
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,290
- Unhand me.
- Never

56
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:29,530
Guess who just got the next week off.

00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:33,400
Oh, don't toy with me, young man,
cause there will be consequences.

Oh, I gotta show you this amazing paint.

- Excellent.

He had his first date last night.

Mr. President,

75
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,830
you need to take this, sir.

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,850
Sir, Speaker of the House?

77

You need to take this now, sir.

This is the President.

79
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,960

at 10 Downey Street.

83
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,480
He is believed to have
suffered a heart attack.

84
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,920
Possibly, from complications
after the surgical procedure

85
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,920
to repair his knee a day earlier.

86
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,080
An autopsy has been scheduled
within the next 48 hours.

87
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:02,260
To determine the actual cause of death.

88
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:03,380

Yes, it's a logistical nightmare.

102

But let's make sure this runs
without a hitch.

103
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:05,490
Questions?

104
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:10,040
And what special requests did
the [ ?? ] circus demand so far?

105
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,830
Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders,
part of the [ ?? ] possibly?

106
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,430
That's a request I can get with [ ?? ]

107
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,630
I'm partial to the Kardashians, myself.
As apparently is Her Majesty.

108
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:24,320
19 special requests from
12 different countries.

109
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,400
We denied all of them.

110
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,830
Any issues or special concern
with our current assessment?

111
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:34,090
We all know about he 350 or
so British nationals who

112
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:36,280
have traveled back and forth
to Syria in the past year,

113
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,040
As we've seen before in Iraq,
and Afghanistan.

114
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,060
Of rising concern is the handful
we believe to be former military.

115
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,130
- Is any of this actionable?
- No.

116
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,320
Very well ..

117
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:52,410
then we send off our dear friend James,

118
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,040
with dignity.

119
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:56,990
Give him a ceremony he deserved.

120
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,770
Sir,

121
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,770
- Are you ready for us?
- Yeah, come on in.

122
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,200
Take a seat.

Head of the Secret Service
Lynn Jacobs

124
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:18,960
What are you guys so damn nervous about?

125
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:22,240
The Brits are world-class.
We all know their reputation.

126
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,370
But still,

127
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,110
These are the trips I hate.

128
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,110
Last minute, out of the country,
no time to plan.

129
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,880
Are you sure I can't talk you out of this?

130
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:33,000
Lynn, it's a state funeral.

131
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:35,620
They're our oldest, strongest ally.

132
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,840
Alright.  I spent half the night
on the line with our advance team.

133
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,960
Metropolitan Police will secure the parameter

134
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,780
of the funeral around St. Paul's Cathedral.

135
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,170
Air Force One will land at
Stansted Airport (London)

136
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:48,240
On the ground, it's all Mike.

137
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:52,770
Touch down. Then a 12-minute chopper
ride to Somerset House.

138
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:55,700
From there we take an armoured vehicle escort

139
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:58,990
down Sweet Street .. to the Cathedral

140
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,320
You don't seem thrilled.

141
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:04,410
The British have their hands full.

142
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,560
It's a cluster-fuck .. sir.

143
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,130
Well,

144
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:13,060
Forty different countries,
with 40 different security teams.

145
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:17,500
Minimal flexibility on approach routes.
funeral seating, egress.

146
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,270
- Can we make it work?
- Mike?

147
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,690
I always do, sir.

148
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:26,370
Good.

149
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,830
I know it's not great timing for you, but ..

150
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,540
It's what I do.

151
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,210
Thank you sir.

152
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:51,030
- There's my man.
- Mr. Vice-President,

153
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,920
- How was your vacation, sir?
- Son,

154
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:57,970
Do you have any idea, the joy a man feels

155
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:01,760
pulling a 70-lb king macarel out of the
waters around Jekyll Island?

156
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:04,240
- No, sir, I don't.
- That makes two of us.

157
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:09,330
And I'll have to wait till next year to find out.
But, thanks for asking.

158
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,960
- It's beautiful.
- There you go.

159
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,630
- It's pretty.
- I love these things.

160
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,350
Don't worry about a thing, we'll be fine.

161
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,640
- Doris, can we have a minute?
- Sure.

162
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:44,850
- Oh you meant Leah? right.
- Very funny, Doris.

163
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,520
She tells me not to worry.

164
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,770
It's only three days.

165
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,110
- Yeah,
- And I'm not due for two weeks.

166
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:02,080
- Walking away, it's not so easy this time.

167
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:05,610
Hey, I got this.

168
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:11,420
You go and you do what you have to do, and
we'll be right here when you get back.

169

Your idea of nesting being, bullet-proofing

Now, that is actually a great idea.

Yes,

181
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,240

339
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:41,320
- Jesus. -- This is all over social media too.
Everybody in the world has seen this.

340
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:44,440
Aamir Bakawi.

341
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:46,250
Number six on the 10 list.

342
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:49,390
This man is responsible for
more deaths than the Plague.

343
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,230
Sells arms to every failed state in the world.

344
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:57,090
Has a vast array of connections,
terrorists, mercenaries, corporations,

345
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:05,070
- Mr. Vice-President, it's Barkawi.
- Put him through.

346
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:14,070
Thought you might take my call.
You understand if I make it difficult to track.

347
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:16,070
You have me at somewhat of a loss.

348
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:21,000
I thought you would've learned a lesson
by now, about crawling out of your hole.

349
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:26,430
- I've never lifted a finger against you.
- You arm those who have.

350
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:32,230
I sold triggers, Mr. Trumbull.
Just like you.

351
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,440
What do you want?

352
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:35,990
Your President.

353
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,830
You can end this right now.

354
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:45,010
- Just hand him over.
- That's not going to happen.

355
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:49,210
Then every death from this moment
forward, will be on your head.

356
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:08,260
Barkawi, sells arms to dummy companies.
Some of them probably in London.

357
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:10,270
Find a connection to him.

358
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:15,220
He's probably been planning this for
years. Everybody makes a mistake.

359
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:17,950
We have to find him before
he finds the President.

360
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:20,660
Let's get to it.

361
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:41,790
- Mike is a bully?
- Yeah.

362
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,150
Not exactly standard police issue.

363
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,650
Really?

364
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:52,550
Oh, my god.

365
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:59,110
- I've never seen a man suffocate before.
- I didn't have a knife.

366
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,890
Got  more ammunition than
the entire US Army.

367
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:06,940
How can they pull something like this off.
Gots to be somebody on the inside.

368
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,200
Yeah, looks like it.

369
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:12,940
These aren't you typical hill-trained
hillbillies. These guys are pros.

370
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,290
- We should go for the Embassy.
- They'll be expecting that.

371
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:21,030
There's a MI-6 safehouse near here.
I have a contact there.

372
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:25,710
We go there, we get geared up, and get an extraction.
- Do you trust them? -- Yeah.

373
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:30,710
The fact is, every single one of these guys
is a terrorist asshole. Until proven otherwise.

374
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:34,520
The only person you trust right now,
is me, okay?

375
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,870
Come on, let's go.

376
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:43,280
- Gotta get underground.
- These guys are everywhere.

377
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:03,140
Let's go.

378
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,640
Stay here. I'll be back.

379
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:12,850
Raza ..

380
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:17,880
Raza

381
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:23,270
Here ..

382
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:31,080
We can do easy, or the hard way.

383
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,420
Raza. Answer me, brother.

384
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:42,900
Raza's not feeling too well at the moment.
He's a little bit fucked up.

385
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,900
Hey, you. What's this dick guy's name?

386
00:44:49,570 --> 00:44:53,350
- This is Kamra. Who is this?
- Hey, Cameron. [sic]

387
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:57,390
- My name is Mike Banning.
- You are the one with the President.

388
00:44:57,870 --> 00:45:03,230
Bingo. So why don't you boys pack up your shit and head
back to Fuckeninstan or wherever it is you're from.

389
00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:10,060
You should've let us kill him quickly.
Because now, we're going to kill him slowly.

390
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:14,470
And stream it live. For the whole world to see.

391
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:17,100
Can you hear me, Mr. President?

392
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:21,340
- Tell him,
- Yeah, he can hear you.

393
00:45:21,430 --> 00:45:23,400
And here's something I want you hear first.

394
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:37,740
That's the sound of your brother dying. Yeah.

395
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:42,350
Not much of a talker, that one.
But I bet one of your men will.

396
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:45,330
I'll see you soon, Cameron [sic]

397
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:51,450
- Was that really necessary?
- No.

398
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:02,140
The Brits are compromised.

399
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:06,530
The police for sure.
Who do you trust?

400
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,590
We can also assume all communications
are compromised.

401
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:12,850
Anything that isn't secured,
could get into the wrong hands, sir.

402
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:16,200
- And Banning would know that too.
- So how could he even reach out for help?

403
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:20,040
There, freeze that. Sir,

404
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:24,250
- Is Banning left-handed?
- No, right-handed.

405
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:28,370
Okay, well, the President doesn't move
without a drone or satellite over his head.

406
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:31,740
- Banning knows that.
- That's his left hand.

407
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:35,370
- Southpaw .. six.
- Shorthand for MI-6.

408
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:39,690
Look for any MI-6 location in that are.

409
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:41,880
- Yes, sir.
- Alright, Banning.

410
00:46:54,430 --> 00:46:57,000
- You okay?
- Yeah.

411
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:00,140
- [ ?? ] , bad choice.
- Hah,

412
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:03,120
Sit down, take deep breaths.

413
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,100
How many you think died?

414
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,370
I don't know .. A lot.

415
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:21,050
All those innocent people.
Dead ... Because of me.

416
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:23,180
No. Not because of you. Because of them.

417
00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:25,210
They tried to kill you, sir.

418
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:29,870
And they killed all these people, just
to make everyone else more afraid.

419
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,790
Well, fuck that.
Fuck them.

420
00:47:32,330 --> 00:47:36,470
Mike ..
You don't let them take me.

421
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:38,640
- I'm not going to.
- You need to do it.

422
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:42,020
If it comes to it.  If it's going south.

423
00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:47,050
If it comes to it, I want you to kill me.

424
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:51,400
That' an order.

425
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:55,130
I will not be prosecuted for propaganda.

426
00:47:55,170 --> 00:47:59,050
As my son and the American people see me on
fucken YouTube for the rest of their lives.

427
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:05,740
.. Okay.

428
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:15,650
- Vice President Trumbull is among us, sir.
- Inspector.

429
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:18,080
I'm afraid our .. news isn't promising.

430
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:21,270
Our dearly departed Prime Minister
James Wilson was assassinated.

431
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:26,480
Poison in his anesthesia, and his doctor's
body found dumped about an hour ago.

432
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:27,680
State funeral ..

433
00:48:28,610 --> 00:48:32,250
Must-attend event for western leaders.
Each one a target.

434
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,300
Goddamn.
And we walked right into it.

435
00:48:35,430 --> 00:48:38,160
And all dead. By your men and ours.

436
00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:39,600
What's happening on the ground?

437
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:45,490
The terrorists have killed 19 first-
responders. We've another 30 unaccounted for.

438
00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:49,800
They're impersonating us. Our people
are walking right into ambushes.

439
00:48:49,850 --> 00:48:51,080
Say the word and we go in.

440
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:55,690
But make no mistake.  We risk turning
London into another Fallujah.

441
00:48:56,360 --> 00:49:00,040
That's the last thing we need.
The President in the middle of an urban battle.

442
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:01,800
Or the citizens of London.

443
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:04,680
Or you're just as likely to take out
half the Metropolitan Police Force,

444
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:08,170
Unless you can tell me how you can tell the
difference between the good guys and the bad guys.

445
00:49:08,390 --> 00:49:12,090
- We're have to stand down our Emergency Services.
- Surrender London?

446
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:12,950
He's right.

447
00:49:14,570 --> 00:49:19,360
Take out all legitimate personnel.
Anyone that remains .. is a terrorist.

448
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,810
Look, the sooner we end this,

449
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:23,730
The more chance there is of stopping
London becoming a complete warzone.

450
00:49:23,790 --> 00:49:25,720
Well, how do we get the
word out to our people?

451
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:28,380
[??] system.

452
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:32,440
We [??] sound that, people know to
stay secure in their place, then ...

453
00:49:33,050 --> 00:49:34,540
You have the military sweep in.

454
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,300
door-to-door, if necessary.

455
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,960
Clear these bastards out.

456
00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:25,480
- Good evening.
- Is Auntie M in?

457
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:40,820
Put that away.

458
00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:45,520
- Are you who I think you are?
- Unfortunately

459
00:50:56,170 --> 00:50:59,750
What a pleasure this is, two handsome men
visiting me on such a lovely evening.

460
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:04,780
- Long time, Jackson. -- Eh, not long enough.
-- Mr. President.

461
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:06,400
Sir,

462
00:51:06,850 --> 00:51:11,180
- Jaqueline, MI-6 finest.  Don't fuck with her.
- Hello.

463
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:25,450
The phones are down.  That said,
It did allow us to pick up this..

464
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:30,570
Mr. President, Banning ..

465
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:36,480
I hope this finds you well.
Mike, we got your message.

466
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:40,640
And I'm sure you don't know
who you can trust,

467
00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:43,930
and all prior authentications
may be compromised.

468
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:46,530
So .. I offer you this,

469
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:54,800
Do you have any idea the joy a man experiences pulling a
70-lb King Mackerel out of the waters around Jekyll Island?

470
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:56,740
That's him.

471
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:04,320
a Delta Team has been clandestinely inserted.
By now they should en route to your position.

472
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:11,120
They'll take you to the US Embassy, where an armored
convoy stands by to get you out of SAM range.

473
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:13,530
- And on to a military train.
- Thank god.

474
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:17,210
- Let's get us out of here.
- Alright, sir.  So who's behind all this?

475
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:20,340
Aamir Bakawi.

476
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:29,190
Bakawi provides armaments.
He's a fucken criminal.

477
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:31,570
Shielded by governments.

478
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:37,840
Mike, there was a drone strike, to get him.
Two years ago, authorized by the G8.

479
00:52:37,930 --> 00:52:38,880
So we took a shot.

480
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:41,900
He survived

481
00:52:42,570 --> 00:52:47,290
We didn't know his family was there.
His daughter was killed.

482
00:52:48,070 --> 00:52:50,160
Well, he certainly got his revenge.

483
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:55,060
- Civilians?
- Well, they're not being targeted specifically, but ..

484
00:52:55,530 --> 00:52:57,740
- Collateral damage?
- Yeah, quite a lot, I'm afraid.

485
00:52:58,130 --> 00:53:02,030
[??] targeting. No official support from
any countries Barkawi shows, but..

486
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:06,740
Didn't have any problems finding the creeps today,
United Nations all with blood on their hands. [??]

487
00:53:08,910 --> 00:53:11,900
- Who's on the inside? There's gotta be somebody.
- Yeah, you're right.

488
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:15,360
They've infiltrated our CCTV system.

489
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:17,390
And they've copied the Wi-Fi network. [??]

490
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:21,670
- Yeah, but who?
- I don't know.

491
00:53:21,870 --> 00:53:24,650
Mike ..
if you hadn't move our schedule up.

492
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:32,370
- Here you go sir, get this in you.
- Thanks.

493
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:35,460
- I don't know about you, but I'm thirsty as fuck.
- Yeah.

494
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:52,230
- How're you doing?
- I was thinking about my son.

495
00:53:54,870 --> 00:53:59,200
He sends me these jokes every day.
It's kind of our, our thing.

496
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:03,520
A little off-color.
His mother wouldn't approve.

497
00:54:04,190 --> 00:54:08,400
I tell you something Mike, These little
messages I get from him everyday,

498
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,790
They mean everything, you'll see.

499
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:20,490
Most important thing, never criticize.
Always encourage.

500
00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:25,040
You just want them to be passionate.
That's what I always tell my son.

501
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:27,540
Find something you care about, and care deeply.

502
00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:32,740
That and the Golden Rule.
Treat others as you like to be treated.

503
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:38,290
- That's it?
- Yeah, basically.

504
00:54:38,890 --> 00:54:40,440
What about all the other stuff.

505
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:47,030
Sleeping, eating, electrical outlets,
diapers, stairs, and ...

506
00:54:47,330 --> 00:54:48,990
That stuff takes care of itself.

507
00:54:49,510 --> 00:54:53,520
- Really?
- No, hah ha, you'll figure it out.

508
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:57,020
Okay, your dates have arrived.

509
00:54:59,590 --> 00:55:02,410
That's under construction.
No one lives or works there.

510
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:08,250
- That's why this is particularly interesting.
- I had my NSA analysts take a peek at the power usage ..

511
00:55:08,470 --> 00:55:10,550
Through the roof the last three weeks.

512
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:13,890
pretty odd, considering no one
lives or works there.

513
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:19,910
Central London.
Right under our bloody noses.

514
00:55:20,930 --> 00:55:22,990
Tell the SAS that we're going
to make a house call.

515
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:30,460

There's no way to dress this up, sir.
It isn't good.

Atta boy.  Don't stop for anyone.

521

- Are we clear?
- Yeah, ha hah. We fucken made it.

522
00:56:34,550 --> 00:56:35,530
Ha ha, we did.

523

524

How many men get to experience
their death witnessed by billions .. live?

547

You are going to go down in history.

- You don't understand,

553
01:00:29,530 --> 01:00:33,170
We have NSA imagery of where you're going.
It's their base of operations.

554

There are nealy a 100 terrorists in there.

01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:38,560
Yeah, well.
They should have brought more men.

556
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:47,840
- Things are ready to get sporty.
- Just watch your balls.

557
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:49,470
Will do.

558
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:34,680

560
01:02:55,700 --> 01:02:59,120
Yeah, they kill the President
the second we try it.

Get the emergency generators up.
Come on!

01:03:27,580 --> 01:03:31,320
Banning, this is what we got.
This is a three-story building..

The entry point is here.  There are
two stairwells. One here, and one here.

568
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:39,950
We believe the President is being held
in this room, on the second floor.

569

this building with everything you got.

No!
The whole world needs to see this.

Hear that, Kamran?
That's the sound of inevitability.

577
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:19,010
I am going to kill you live. But that doesn't
mean you can't suffer privately first.
