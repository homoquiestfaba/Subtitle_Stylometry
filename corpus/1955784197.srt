I can't stop dancing.
I love this band.

They're o.K.

17
00:01:28,856 --> 00:01:29,990
They're the same band

his last wedding.

19
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,162
Think he's wearing
the same suit, too.

20
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:35,329
Different girl,
though, right?

21
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:37,198
That's good.
Oh, yeah.

God, I love a wedding.
This remind you of yours?

23
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:42,336
No. I think
these two people

24
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:44,438
actually
like each other.

25
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:46,440
Anyway, I barely
remember my wedding.

Thank god.

my divorce.

30
00:01:55,216 --> 00:01:57,418
Lovely divorce.
That was a good band.

00:01:57,518 --> 00:01:59,052

Hello,
Sarah.

36
00:02:06,294 --> 00:02:07,561
We were dancing,

37
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:10,030
and she swept me
off my feet.

38
00:02:10,198 --> 00:02:12,500
This is fast, Dave,
even for you.

40
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:14,768
Yes?

41
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:16,204
Will you marry me?

42
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:19,207
Oh, please? Please?
Come on.

give him this time?

62

Six months.

63

A year.

64
00:02:58,746 --> 00:03:01,349

95
00:04:28,336 --> 00:04:29,703
I'm Dr. David townsend,

96
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:32,406
and we're talking
about divorce.

97
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:36,176
It affects all of us
and hurts many of us,

98
00:04:36,344 --> 00:04:38,178
and in the next 48 hours,

99
00:04:38,346 --> 00:04:41,181
that is all we will
be talking about--divorce.

100
00:04:41,349 --> 00:04:46,354
D-i-v-o-r-c-e, tell you
what it means to me.

101
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:49,490
What does it mean to you,
Jack from glendale?

102
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:50,624
Are you still there?

103
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:51,659
I'm right here, doc.

104
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:52,960
I think before the break,

105
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,163
we were discussing
Debra, your ex-wife.

106
00:04:56,397 --> 00:04:57,665
Do we have to?

107
00:04:57,765 --> 00:05:00,501
Jack, the topic
is divorce.

108
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:03,637
I only see my kids
twice a month.

109
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:05,072
Two weekends, that's it.

110
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:07,375
Every time, we have
to start over again.

111
00:05:07,475 --> 00:05:10,010
I feel your pain, Jack.
I do. I feel it.

112
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,480
I understand it.
That's my job,

113
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,647
and that's why
you listen to me--

114
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:17,385
Dr. David townsend--
because I listen to you.

115
00:05:17,418 --> 00:05:18,386
Could I say one
more thing, doc?

116
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:20,854
No, Jack.
It's time to move on.

117
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:23,557

the doctor is in.

118
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:25,693
Hi, doc. I'm on my way
to pick up my son.

Where do you do
your exchange?

We stick to
neutral territory--

fast-food places.

I feel your anxiety,

about my ex-wife

Craig. I do.

all her fault!

Listen to yourself,

so blocked.

I don't know.

140
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:10,971
Then you have to listen
to what I'm saying.

141
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:13,974
Don't just hear it,
really listen.

142

00:06:15,443 --> 00:06:16,143

You should.

you can order the tapes

It's not like the old days

151
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,159
when I'd just say
"ducky's here"

152
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,727
and he'd hop in.

153
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:36,296
He's 9 years old.
He's a man now.

154

That's history.

00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:46,373
Yeah. I make
a game out of it.

his vegetables.

161
00:06:49,877 --> 00:06:51,011
I promised
if he hits 1,000,

162
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:52,780
I'd rent him
an "r" video.

163
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,482
He'll be 18 by then.

164
00:06:54,515 --> 00:06:56,817

ran into Marty allenford.

165
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:59,052
He and Leslie are
getting a divorce.

166
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:01,254
They're splitting up,
Marty and Leslie?

167
00:07:01,489 --> 00:07:02,923
After 11 years.

168
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:05,493
It goes to show you,
you're never safe.

169
00:07:05,593 --> 00:07:07,327
11 years busting his ass,

170
00:07:07,495 --> 00:07:09,830
bringing home a paycheck,
for what?

171
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,565
He seemed
pretty depressed.

172
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:12,633
He must have done
something terrible,

00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:15,769
like leave the cap
off the toothpaste.

174
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:18,271
Actually, he was sleeping
with his secretary.

175
00:07:18,506 --> 00:07:19,873
Yeah, well...

the distance anymore.

00:07:31,852 --> 00:07:32,986
Amen.

182
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:34,955
Marty and Leslie.
That's unbelievable.

183
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:37,891
That Leslie's
a beautiful woman.

184
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:39,259
Hey.

185
00:07:39,527 --> 00:07:40,528
She's not?

186
00:07:40,594 --> 00:07:41,895
You can't call her yet.

187
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:43,697
There's a five-day
waiting period.

188
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:46,166
That's for handguns.
Don't.

189
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:48,401
Here's that recipe
you guys wanted,

190
00:07:48,536 --> 00:07:50,738
the one
your kids loved?

191
00:07:50,838 --> 00:07:52,039
"Vic's meat loaf
madness."

192
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,406
You wrote it up?

193
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:55,776
Yeah. it's all there--
onions, tomatoes, cheese,

194
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:57,210
my own secret sauce.

195
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,914
Is it under 10 minutes?
If not, I can't do it.

196
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:04,785
1 1/2 minutes on high,
serves a family of four.

197
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:06,887
Ragu. that's
your secret sauce?

198
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,322
You want to
keep it down?

199
00:08:09,557 --> 00:08:10,791
I'm sorry.

200
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:12,960
Max, you are late
all the time.

201
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,194
I'll have to
fire you

202
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:16,163
one day soon,
like now.

203
00:08:16,263 --> 00:08:18,899
Hector, can I crash
at your place tonight?

204
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:21,735
No, you can't crash
at my place tonight.

205
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,937
I am trying to fire you.

206
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:26,807
You can't fire me.
You love me.

207
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:29,743
I love you.
We're in love.

208
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,780
Max, what am i
going to do with you?

209
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,181
Something wrong at home?

210
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:35,783
No.

211
00:08:35,883 --> 00:08:37,084
Because my wife's
family's in town--

212
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:39,787
hey, forget it.
It's no big deal.

213
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:40,921
Hey, look, uh...

214
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:43,791
If you got
no place else,

215
00:08:43,891 --> 00:08:45,358
come on over.

216
00:08:45,593 --> 00:08:46,760
Thanks, man.

217
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,696
Yeah. let's
get to work.

218
00:08:48,796 --> 00:08:49,797
We've got
a trainee.

219
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:51,131
Is she cute?

220
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:53,166
She's a man,
and she's 70.

221
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:55,836
Oh, Hector,
the adopt-a-geezer program?

222
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:57,871
It's called
mcmasters.

223
00:08:57,971 --> 00:09:00,841
Hey, Walter, want you
to meet somebody.

224
00:09:00,941 --> 00:09:03,777
Walter Simms,
meet Max Cooper.

225
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:04,978
Hello, Max.

226
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:06,213
Hello,
Walter.

227
00:09:06,313 --> 00:09:08,882
He's going
to be training you.

228
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:10,884
Good luck.

229
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:12,953
So, Walt, any
previous experience?

230
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,756
No. I'm here on
the adopt-a-geezer program.

231
00:09:15,856 --> 00:09:17,725
So what did you do
before this?

232
00:09:17,825 --> 00:09:19,226
Built engines
for Chrysler.

233
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:21,028
Perfect.

234
00:09:21,128 --> 00:09:22,996
Listen, something big
has come up

235
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:24,732
you guys should know about.

236
00:09:24,832 --> 00:09:25,933
You o.K.?

237
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:27,768
I got a date
tomorrow night.

238
00:09:27,868 --> 00:09:29,002
That is big.

239
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:31,038
That's two in
the last eight months.

240
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:32,105
Three.

241
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:33,741
Not counting your cousin.

242
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:34,842
Two.

243
00:09:34,942 --> 00:09:37,077
Wha--who? where
did you meet her?

244
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:40,347
I haven't met her yet.
It's a blind date.

245
00:09:40,648 --> 00:09:41,715
Ooh.

246
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:42,916
Uh-oh.

247
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:44,351
That's good.
That's terrific.

248
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:46,353
That's terrific that
you're dating again.

249
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:49,122
Donny, you could think
about dating again, too.

250
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:50,323
Might be time.

251
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,926
Not yet. Not so soon
after the divorce.

252
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:54,527
It's been three years.

253
00:09:54,662 --> 00:09:57,030
I understand. I just--
i don't think Claire

254
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,031
would be comfortable
with it.

255
00:09:58,131 --> 00:10:00,167
Claire's not
going to notice.

256
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:02,069
Why? because Claire
has a life,

257
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:03,103
something I'd like
to point out

258
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:05,372
you do not
currently possess.

259
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,406
It's interesting

260
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:07,875
that you
mention Claire

261
00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:09,943
because last time
i dropped Emma off,

262
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:11,745
Claire came to
the car to say hi,

263
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:14,447
and...it was like
the old attraction

264
00:10:14,648 --> 00:10:15,849
was still there.

265
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,150
Was her new husband
with her?

266
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,518
I'm serious.

267
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,120
It's like she
didn't want to let me go.

268
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,222
She was reaching out to me.

269
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:25,292
She had this face.
She was like...Hmm.

270
00:10:25,392 --> 00:10:26,827
Why do this
to yourself?

271
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:29,062
I'm just telling you
what I saw.

272
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:33,533
She came to the car
and went...Hmm. Like that.

273
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,804
Uh-oh, Dave.
Look who's here.

274
00:10:36,904 --> 00:10:38,571
[Dave]
shoot. here comes Kim.

275
00:10:38,772 --> 00:10:39,907
[Vic]
so what?

276
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:42,309
Guys, we were at the dodger
game last night, o.K.?

277
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:43,844
I don't want to.

278
00:10:43,944 --> 00:10:46,179
You weren't
feeling well.

279
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:47,214
What did I have?

280
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:48,849
Your choice.

281
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:51,819
Saw your car.
Thought I'd say hi.

282
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:52,953
[Dave]
what a surprise!

283
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:54,321
Hi, Kim.

284
00:10:54,421 --> 00:10:57,057
Hey, great game
last night, you guys, huh?

285
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,959
Are you
feeling better, Donny?

286
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:02,295
Still I got, like,
this thing and...Ahem!

287
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:04,297
You guys take me
with you next time.

288
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:05,966
I love baseball.

289
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:07,300
Keep score
and everything.

290
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,202
Sit down. I'll
get you something.

291
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:10,270
Is it safe?

292
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,604
Yeah.
they're always late.

293
00:11:11,739 --> 00:11:14,141
Good. I'll get juice.
You want anything?

294
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:15,275
No.
I'm fine.

295
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,277
Be right
back.

296
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:22,950
That is one sweet,
beautiful girl,

297
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:23,984
except for the fact

298
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:26,119
that she's not
seven different women.

299
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:27,220
I love Kim.

300
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,456
I'm barely seeing
anybody else.

301
00:11:29,757 --> 00:11:30,758
[Horn honks]

302
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:32,125
Hey, Vic.
It's your ex.

303
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:35,896
Here we go.
Let the games begin.

304
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:39,132
Here. hold onto this
for me, will ya?

305
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,601
Hey, dad!

306
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:43,603
Hey, champ!
Whoa!

307
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:45,873
Hi, daddy!
Love you.

308
00:11:45,973 --> 00:11:48,041
[Woman]
hello, Vic.

309
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:49,977
Hi.

310
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:51,078
This is awesome.

311
00:11:51,178 --> 00:11:53,781
I'm so happy to
see you, daddy!

312
00:11:53,814 --> 00:11:56,049
We're not going
to the video store.

313
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:57,117
Oh, come on, dad!

314
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,286
We can get
the yearling again.

315
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:00,620
No. we watched
the yearling

316
00:12:00,788 --> 00:12:02,890
a thousand times
last week.

317
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:05,358
The deer will die,
we'll all cry,

318
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:06,559
and nobody
will get to sleep.

319
00:12:06,794 --> 00:12:07,795
It's educational.

320
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:10,497
No. we're not going
to watch the yearling.

321
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:12,933
I mean it. Can't go
through that again.

322
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:14,667
Just think
about it, o.K.?

323
00:12:14,802 --> 00:12:16,503
Daddy,
you didn't shave.

324
00:12:16,804 --> 00:12:17,805
I forgot.

325
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:19,139
Looks good that way.

326
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:22,042
I'll shave
when I get home.

327
00:12:23,811 --> 00:12:25,045
Hi, dad.

328
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:26,646
Hi, sweetheart.

329
00:12:26,814 --> 00:12:29,149
Donny, I'm so sorry
we're late.

330
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,018
We had to return
the graduation dress.

331
00:12:31,118 --> 00:12:32,185
You returned
another one?

332
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:34,054
I thought the last
one was the one.

333
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:35,455
Sunday's
graduation.

334
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:37,024
It made me
look fat.

335
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:39,592
You couldn't look fat
if you wanted to.

336
00:12:39,827 --> 00:12:40,994
Why would I want to?

337
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,563
You wouldn't. You couldn't.

338
00:12:43,831 --> 00:12:45,265
Whatever you wear,

339
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:46,366
you're going to
look beautiful

340
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:48,301
because you are
a beautiful girl.

341
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:49,702
When I was your age,

342
00:12:49,837 --> 00:12:51,939
no girls were as beautiful
as you, except your mom.

343
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:54,107
And you got your mother's
good looks, em.

344
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:57,244
You got her eyes.
Beautiful eyes.

345
00:12:57,344 --> 00:12:58,979
Mine are brown,
hers are green.

346
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:03,016
The shape. I'm talking
about the shape of the eye.

347
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,985
Yeah. I'm going
inside. Bye, mom.

348
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:07,120
Have a good weekend,
darling.

349
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:11,992
Well, she seems
excited, huh?

350
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:13,126
No, she doesn't.

351
00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:16,029
But inside, I think
she is. We all are.

352
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,765
Do you believe
how she fawns over me?

353
00:13:18,866 --> 00:13:20,868
For a girl to pay that much
attention to her father,

354
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:22,870
that's just
embarrassing.

355
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,671
Bye, mom.
Bye, sweetheart.

356
00:13:24,872 --> 00:13:25,939
I love
you.

357
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:28,041
Have fun, now.
Brush your teeth.

358
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,642
O.k.
just once?

359
00:13:29,877 --> 00:13:31,011
Come on, jed.

360
00:13:31,111 --> 00:13:32,212
Don't bite
your sister.

361
00:13:34,882 --> 00:13:37,050
I see you're driving
the child support mobile.

362
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:40,320
Jed's got two more days
of antibiotics

363
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,354
he has to take.

364
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:42,722
These are
new tires, aren't they?

365
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:45,525
When did you get new tires?
They're michelins!

366
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:46,693
They were on sale
at sears,

367
00:13:46,894 --> 00:13:48,061
and I just thought,

368
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,729
"I'm going to get
myself something

369
00:13:49,897 --> 00:13:51,731
"most women my age
only dream of--

370
00:13:51,965 --> 00:13:52,933
new tires."

371
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:56,003
That's a new coat, too.

372
00:13:56,103 --> 00:13:57,004
Did that
come with the tires?

373
00:13:57,104 --> 00:13:58,105
Don't let jed

374
00:13:58,205 --> 00:13:59,539
have too much sugar
this weekend, o.K.?

375
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,708
Grace, the money
i send is for the kids,

376
00:14:01,909 --> 00:14:04,277
not for new tires.

377
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:05,312
I'm serious.

378
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:07,114
I scraped him off
the ceiling last time.

379
00:14:07,214 --> 00:14:08,481
What's this?

380
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:11,318
Nothing. just a few
things I've jotted down.

381
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:13,453
Good. a list of ways
i can improve myself.

382
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:15,422
I feel like
we're still married.

383
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:17,124
They're just thoughts.

384
00:14:17,224 --> 00:14:19,927
Yeah, well, here's
a thought. Listen.

385
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:22,930
Are you still dating
that young jerk

386
00:14:22,963 --> 00:14:24,097
with long hair
and no job?

387
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,198
Gerald?

388
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:26,366
Yeah, Gerald.

389
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:28,936
Who I date is
none of your business.

390
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:31,271
Tell Gerald if he
touches my boy again,

391
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:32,940
I'll kill him.

392
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:35,042
It was nothing, a tap,

393
00:14:35,142 --> 00:14:36,776
and jed was being
very, very rude.

394
00:14:36,944 --> 00:14:38,345
I don't care if jed

395
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:40,080
was taking a piss
on his head.

396
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:44,251
He touches him again,
he dies. Tell him.

397
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,956
[Claire]
so I'll see you tomorrow?

398
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:51,424
I don't think I'll make
your graduation brunch.

399
00:14:51,524 --> 00:14:52,792
It just
feels a little...

400
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:53,793
Uncomfortable?

401
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:55,328
A little bit.

402
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:56,596
I understand.

403
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:58,131
It's Phil's club
and everything.

404
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:00,133
You don't
have to come.

405
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:01,969
You don't
want me to?

406
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:04,637
No. I want you to come.
You're the dad.

407
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:08,575
Right. I am the dad,
and maybe I will come.

408
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:11,344
Good. see you tomorrow.

409
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:14,982
Uh, here. Here's a...

410
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:18,185
Oh, Donny, you don't
have to keep doing this.

411
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:20,020
No, no, no. I want to.

412
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,821
O.k.

413
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:23,556
Thanks.

414
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,229
You look good.

415
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:31,264
Oh, you look good,
too, Claire.

416
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:32,799
You look fabulous.

417
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:34,034
Thanks.

418
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:35,602
Incredible.

419
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:39,506
Unbelievable.

420
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:42,175
Aren't you
supposed to wait

421
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:43,910
for that timer
to ring?

422
00:15:44,011 --> 00:15:46,746
Yeah, but once
you've been here

423
00:15:47,014 --> 00:15:47,847
as long as I have,

424
00:15:48,015 --> 00:15:50,017
you feel when
the fries are ready.

425
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,018
It's a zen thing.

426
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:52,319
I see.

427
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:53,553
There are really only
two rules here--

428
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:58,025
don't be late
and don't eat the food.

429
00:15:58,091 --> 00:15:59,126
O.k., jed,

430
00:15:59,226 --> 00:16:01,028
what's the capital
of south Dakota?

431
00:16:01,061 --> 00:16:02,362
Come on, dad.
You know this.

432
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,531
It doesn't matter
if I know it.

433
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:06,433
Do you know it?
It's your homework.

434
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:08,301
Pierre.

435
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:10,403
No way! I mean good!

436
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:13,040
Excellent. that's,
uh, full credit.

437
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:16,409
She used to sit on my lap,
laugh at my jokes,

438
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:18,178
call me Poppy pop,

439
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:20,280
and now look at her.

440
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,282
You want me to
call you Poppy pop?

441
00:16:22,382 --> 00:16:27,087
It's not the same.
Why won't she sit with us?

442
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:28,388
You don't sit
with your dad

443
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,057
when you flirt.

444
00:16:30,123 --> 00:16:32,259
You think she's flirting?
She's barely 14.

445
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:33,926
Of course
she's flirting.

446
00:16:34,061 --> 00:16:35,895
[Dave]
i think Kim's right.

447
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:37,164
Oh, god. Oh, god.

448
00:16:37,264 --> 00:16:39,566
Well, I think
it's adorable.

449
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,935
This is deeply,
deeply terrifying here.

450
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:45,838
Somebody seems
to like you, kid.

451
00:16:46,073 --> 00:16:47,974
Those two over there?

452
00:16:48,075 --> 00:16:50,943
It's the uniform, Walt.
Get used to it.

453
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:52,145
It drives girls crazy.

454
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:53,913
Well, I'll be
careful, then.

455
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:55,915
I'm serious. Don't
wear this on the street.

456
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:59,086
Babes will
tear you apart.

457
00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:00,920
He is so cute.

458
00:17:01,088 --> 00:17:02,122
You think he's
smiling at us?

459
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:05,158
Right, he's going
to smile at me.

460
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:06,926
I look stupid
in this uniform.

461
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:07,927
It looks great.

462
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:09,296
It makes me look 14.

463
00:17:09,396 --> 00:17:10,463
You are 14.

464
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:11,798
Exactly.

465
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:16,569
Hey! hey!

466
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:18,305
Dad!
dad!

467
00:17:18,405 --> 00:17:19,706
Hey, Michele!
Ben!

468
00:17:19,806 --> 00:17:20,973
[Michele]
i missed you!

469
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:22,509
Hey!
how are you?

470
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:24,711
Hey! I missed
you so much!

471
00:17:24,811 --> 00:17:26,513
Ooh,
i missed you.

472
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:35,555
Hi, Susan.

473
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:36,656
Hi.

474
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:38,491
Hi, Vic.

475
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:40,193
Donny.

476
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:51,538
It's Michele's
fish.

477
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:58,445
Could I talk to you
for a minute, please,

478
00:17:58,545 --> 00:17:59,446
outside?

479
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:00,780
Sure.

480
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,449
You want fries?

481
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:03,550
Yeah.

482
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:06,719
Your uncles
are going to fix you up.

483
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:07,787
I'll be right back.

484
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:08,988
[Donny]
that's your fish?

485
00:18:09,156 --> 00:18:10,490
I didn't see that
on the menu.

486
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,397
They're getting
blonder, Dave.

487
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:18,431
I can explain--

488
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:20,433
and she's a little
young, isn't she?

489
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:23,370
The exchange was
supposed to be just us.

490
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,004
It's complicated
enough, god knows.

491
00:18:25,172 --> 00:18:27,006
She wasn't supposed
to be here.

492
00:18:27,174 --> 00:18:30,042
What, she couldn't get
her homework done in time?

493
00:18:30,177 --> 00:18:32,044
She's really good
with the kids.

494
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:33,380
Yippee, Dave.
I mean--

495
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,048
am I supposed to be
excited about that--

496
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:37,784
Bambi's good
with the kids?

497
00:18:37,884 --> 00:18:39,018
I didn't want you
to think

498
00:18:39,186 --> 00:18:42,088
I'd just let anyone
around the kids.

499
00:18:42,189 --> 00:18:44,357
Please. if it meant
a chance to get laid,

500
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:47,527
you'd let Hannibal Lecter
be their nanny.

501
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:50,463
That's not true,
and you know it.

502
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:59,206
Ben has a teacher conference,
Wednesday at 9:00.

503
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:01,408
I have an appointment.
Can you do it?

504
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:02,875
Sure. I like
Mr. capello.

505
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,877
Gets food
in his beard,

506
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,679
but he's
a lovely guy.

507
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:07,780
You won't forget?

508
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,848
No.

509
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,051
We're on chapter six.

510
00:19:12,219 --> 00:19:14,120
I've been doing
all the voices.

511
00:19:14,221 --> 00:19:16,256
Don't make the bad guy
too scary.

512
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:17,624
Michele's on the edge.

513
00:19:17,724 --> 00:19:20,260
Got you, honey.
Anything else?

514
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,561
Nope.

515
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:23,563
I'd tell you
to grow up,

516
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,665
but what would
be the point?

517
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:28,468
Yeah.

518
00:19:28,568 --> 00:19:31,338
See ya.

519
00:19:31,438 --> 00:19:33,640
Sue?

520
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,309
I really am sorry.

521
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:41,848
* ...But now
i feel them slip away *

522
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:47,654
* it makes me cry

523
00:19:47,754 --> 00:19:49,422
come on, daddy!
Slide!

524
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:50,690
Yeah, dad!
Come on!

525
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,259
I'll be
right there.

526
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:55,395
* to see love die

527
00:19:55,495 --> 00:19:57,597
* so sad to...

528
00:19:57,697 --> 00:20:00,367
And now back to
Dr. David townsend.

529
00:20:00,467 --> 00:20:01,634
Thank you, Paul.

530
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:02,602
We're back,
we're live,

531
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,170
and we're
taking your calls

532
00:20:04,271 --> 00:20:06,639
on one subject
and one subject only,

533
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:08,007
the painful subject

534
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,776
of divorce.

535
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:12,144
Linda from hacienda
heights, you there?

536
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:14,514
I'm here,
Dr. townsend.

537
00:20:14,614 --> 00:20:17,216
What do I hear
in that voice, Linda?

538
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:19,619
Do I hear longing?
Do I hear loss?

539
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,988
Open up, dear.
I'm here for you.

540
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,756
I hate this guy.

541
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:24,791
I hate this guy.

542
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:26,158
I hate this guy.

543
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:30,497
I mean, I really,
really hate this guy.

544
00:20:30,597 --> 00:20:32,865
Last week was my son
Kevin's birthday.

545
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:34,501
He turned 6.

546
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:35,802
Happy birthday,
Kevin.

547
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:37,537
And his father
was supposed

548
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:39,572
to take him
to a hockey game.

549
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:40,807
He likes hockey

550
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:42,575
because there's
a lot of fighting.

551
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:44,977
His father, not Kevin.
He loves fighting.

552
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,846
Well, that can
be healthy...

553
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:48,748
Or not healthy.

554
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:50,249
Go on.

555
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,952
Well, we wait,
and we wait,

556
00:20:53,052 --> 00:20:55,422
and he never
shows up.

557
00:20:55,522 --> 00:20:57,223
He missed his
son's birthday.

558
00:20:57,324 --> 00:20:58,257
He didn't
even call!

559
00:20:58,358 --> 00:21:01,361
That son of a bitch!
Can I say that?

560
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:03,162
Because that is
the only word for it.

561
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:04,331
Son of a bitch!

562
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:06,333
What is the matter
with you people?

563
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:09,235
You think just because
you didn't get custody,

564
00:21:09,336 --> 00:21:11,203
these kids just disappear?

565
00:21:11,338 --> 00:21:13,573
The minute
the divorce comes through,

566
00:21:13,673 --> 00:21:15,542
you jump on a motorcycle,

567
00:21:15,642 --> 00:21:17,677
you buy a couple of gallons
of grecian formula,

568
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:19,979
you read up on sexually
transmitted diseases,

569
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:21,981
and you think
you're a new man.

570
00:21:22,081 --> 00:21:24,050
Meanwhile, there's a whole
generation of kids

571
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,919
that have Nick at nite
for a father.

572
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:29,021
Let me tell you
something.

573
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,624
There's an old
African saying,

574
00:21:31,724 --> 00:21:37,364
mi Toto hulelua
lacagimi kisima,

575
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,765
which means,

576
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:42,535
"it takes the village
to raise the child."

577
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:46,072
Hey, guys, wake up.
Your village is calling.

578
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:10,563
You know we depend on
our crops to live, don't we?

579
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:11,998
Yes, sir.

580
00:22:12,098 --> 00:22:13,933
And there ain't
a way in the world

581
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:15,267
to keep
that wild yearling

582
00:22:15,402 --> 00:22:16,403
from destroying them.

583
00:22:16,469 --> 00:22:18,170
Yes, sir.

584
00:22:18,405 --> 00:22:19,906
I'm sorry.

585
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:23,109
I can't never
tell you how sorry.

586
00:22:23,209 --> 00:22:26,979
But all's been done
was possible.

587
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:29,315
Take the yearling
out in the woods

588
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:32,118
and tie him
and shoot him.

589
00:22:35,755 --> 00:22:37,424
Pa!

590
00:22:44,464 --> 00:22:45,932
Oh!

591
00:22:53,973 --> 00:22:55,775
They're asleep.

592
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,043
Yes!

593
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:03,516
Dave.

594
00:23:03,616 --> 00:23:05,785
I don't feel
comfortable with this.

595
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:08,287
No. look, Kim. You
don't understand kids.

596
00:23:08,488 --> 00:23:09,822
We've been granted 8,

597
00:23:09,922 --> 00:23:11,090
maybe 10 minutes
alone here.

598
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,592
There's going to be
glasses of water later.

599
00:23:12,692 --> 00:23:14,994
There's going
to be pee-pee.

600
00:23:15,094 --> 00:23:17,730
We cannot dawdle.

601
00:23:19,466 --> 00:23:20,933
O.k.

602
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:22,669
O.k.

603
00:23:22,769 --> 00:23:24,904
But not here.

604
00:23:25,004 --> 00:23:26,573
Shh!

605
00:23:26,673 --> 00:23:29,208
* ...And makes me realize
when she says *

606
00:23:29,476 --> 00:23:30,342
goodness gracious.

607
00:23:30,543 --> 00:23:32,479
* don't worry, baby... *

608
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:34,146
ha ha!

609
00:23:34,481 --> 00:23:36,015
Shh!

610
00:23:36,115 --> 00:23:39,886
* everything will turn
out all right *

611
00:23:39,986 --> 00:23:42,354
* don't worry, baby

612
00:23:42,489 --> 00:23:45,892
* don't worry, baby

613
00:23:45,992 --> 00:23:48,728
* ooh, ooh...

614
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:55,001
Ah!

615
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:56,969
Dad?

616
00:23:58,905 --> 00:24:02,308
Ben.
Ben, my son.

617
00:24:02,509 --> 00:24:04,076
I want some water.

618
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:05,778
Yes. you have
every right.

619
00:24:05,878 --> 00:24:07,079
Water is for everyone.

620
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:09,882
What were you doing
to her?

621
00:24:09,982 --> 00:24:11,050
We were
trying on clothes.

622
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,084
Different clothes.

623
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:13,686
Different kinds
of clothes.

624
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:15,522
She's not spending
the night, is she?

625
00:24:15,588 --> 00:24:17,890
No. you're
not going to,

626
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,526
are you, Kim?
No.

627
00:24:19,592 --> 00:24:22,261
'Cause she's not supposed
to sleep over, you said.

628
00:24:22,529 --> 00:24:25,131
I know. I know.

629
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:30,870
Let's get that water.

630
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:39,679
* when we were young,
we pledged allegiance *

631
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:42,248
* every morning of our lives

632
00:24:42,348 --> 00:24:46,886
* the classroom rang
with children's voices *

633
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:50,022
* under teacher's watchful eye

634
00:24:50,122 --> 00:24:53,960
* we learned about
the world around us *

635
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:57,263
* at our desks
and at dinnertime *

636
00:24:57,363 --> 00:25:01,000
* reminded of
the starving children *

637
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:05,004
* we cleaned our plates
with guilty minds *

638
00:25:05,104 --> 00:25:08,040
* and the stones in the road

639
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:12,078
* they shone like diamonds
in the dust *

640
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:15,114
* and then a voice
called to us *

641
00:25:15,214 --> 00:25:19,786
* to make our way
back home *

642
00:25:52,619 --> 00:25:53,319
hey.

643
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,353
Hey.

644
00:25:54,621 --> 00:25:55,788
Come on in.

645
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:57,356
Kim go home?

646
00:25:57,624 --> 00:25:58,758
Yeah.
Ben's not ready

647
00:25:58,858 --> 00:26:00,793
for her
to stay over yet.

648
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:01,894
Yeah.

649
00:26:01,994 --> 00:26:03,162
Where is Emma?

650
00:26:03,262 --> 00:26:04,897
She's sleeping
over at Meg's.

651
00:26:04,997 --> 00:26:06,365
On your weekend?

652
00:26:06,633 --> 00:26:07,767
I thought you

653
00:26:07,867 --> 00:26:08,935
weren't going to
do that anymore.

654
00:26:09,035 --> 00:26:10,069
I thought so, too,

655
00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:13,139
but I don't think
it's worth the fight.

656
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:14,841
Those are
the only choices?

657
00:26:14,941 --> 00:26:16,809
Fight or she sleeps
someplace else?

658
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:19,078
It's all that's
available at the moment.

659
00:26:19,178 --> 00:26:21,748
It's a very awkward
age for girls.

660
00:26:21,848 --> 00:26:23,750
Really?
what age is that?

661
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:26,653
12 through 35.
Very awkward.

662
00:26:26,719 --> 00:26:28,755
But I'm going to
make up for it tomorrow.

663
00:26:28,855 --> 00:26:30,990
I'm going to cook us
a special dinner.

664
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,792
Vic's meat loaf
madness?

665
00:26:32,892 --> 00:26:34,060
I'm thinking
about it.

666
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,696
You want to sack out
here tonight?

667
00:26:36,796 --> 00:26:37,797
No, that's o.K.

668
00:26:37,897 --> 00:26:39,065
I was gonna call you
anyway,

669
00:26:39,165 --> 00:26:40,967
see if you could take Ben
to soccer tomorrow.

670
00:26:41,067 --> 00:26:42,268
Why? you can't
take him?

671
00:26:42,368 --> 00:26:45,271
No. I got to take
Michele to t-ball.

672
00:26:45,371 --> 00:26:48,007
I promised Vic
I'd take jed to karate.

673
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:50,209
He's taking Lindsay
to "mommy and me."

674
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:52,712
None of these kids
drive yet?

675
00:26:52,812 --> 00:26:53,780
What do you say?

676
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,247
Is my toothbrush
still here?

677
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:58,150
It's in the bathroom.
I'll get some blankets.

678
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,986
Thank you.

679
00:27:05,391 --> 00:27:08,194
* and the stones in the road

680
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:12,331
* they shone like diamonds
in the dust *

681
00:27:12,431 --> 00:27:15,802
* and then a voice
called to us *

682
00:27:15,902 --> 00:27:20,072
* to make our way
back home *

683
00:27:34,821 --> 00:27:37,123
* ahh

684
00:27:37,223 --> 00:27:42,028
* yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah *

685
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:51,804
marriage vows have no
meaning to you people!

686
00:27:51,904 --> 00:27:54,240
Marriage isn't for better
or for worse anymore.

687
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:57,209
It's just till someone feels
they need more space.

688
00:27:57,309 --> 00:28:00,146
You want more space?
Buy a ranch in Colorado.

689
00:28:00,246 --> 00:28:03,049
You got married. You got kids.
Stay together, damn it!

690
00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:04,784
We'll be right back.

691
00:28:04,884 --> 00:28:08,387
* d-i-v-o-r-c-e

692
00:28:08,487 --> 00:28:11,824
Dr. townsend, it's
your ex-wife on line two.

693
00:28:11,924 --> 00:28:14,126
Tell her I'm not here.

694
00:28:15,928 --> 00:28:17,830
[Applause and cheering]

695
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:20,232
Heads up, now!
Heads up!

696
00:28:21,868 --> 00:28:24,070
Michele,
come on in closer.

697
00:28:25,805 --> 00:28:27,840
Come on!

698
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:30,777
Oh!
oh!

699
00:28:30,843 --> 00:28:31,878
Don't worry
about it!

700
00:28:31,978 --> 00:28:33,780
You can do it.

701
00:28:33,813 --> 00:28:37,784
That's all right, Michele.
You'll get the next one.

702
00:28:37,884 --> 00:28:39,351
Hey, batter!

703
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:42,354
What are you doing?

704
00:28:43,923 --> 00:28:45,992
Come on, Michele!

705
00:28:50,963 --> 00:28:52,999
Put your name
on it, Michele!

706
00:28:57,003 --> 00:28:59,806
Go, Michele! Go!
No! Go to first!

707
00:28:59,872 --> 00:29:02,374
Go to first!

708
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:05,611
The other way!

709
00:29:05,845 --> 00:29:08,014
The other way!

710
00:29:13,853 --> 00:29:15,187
Michele!

711
00:29:15,287 --> 00:29:17,990
Hey!

712
00:29:19,992 --> 00:29:21,828
Got to be impressed

713
00:29:21,928 --> 00:29:22,929
with her knowledge
of the fundamentals.

714
00:29:23,029 --> 00:29:24,831
Oh, I know I am.

715
00:29:24,931 --> 00:29:25,998
Where is Harry?

716
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:27,834
He shouldn't
be missing this.

717
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:30,702
Oh, Harry and I...
We're separated.

718
00:29:30,903 --> 00:29:32,972
Oh, no!
Sheila, how long?

719
00:29:33,072 --> 00:29:35,875
I mean,
more than five days?

720
00:29:35,975 --> 00:29:39,678
A month. It's not
going to work out.

721
00:29:39,846 --> 00:29:41,413
It's over.
I'm already back

722
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:42,581
to using
my maiden name.

723
00:29:42,849 --> 00:29:43,950
Sumter.

724
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:45,351
Oh, sumter.
Like the fort.

725
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:48,054
Yeah.

726
00:29:48,955 --> 00:29:49,856
Oh!

727
00:29:49,956 --> 00:29:51,991
[Applause]

728
00:29:55,194 --> 00:29:56,262
[Sigh]

729
00:29:56,362 --> 00:29:58,164
I can't believe
I'm dating again.

730
00:29:58,264 --> 00:29:59,565
That whole scene.

731
00:29:59,665 --> 00:30:02,969
Don't worry.
You're going to do fine.

732
00:30:03,069 --> 00:30:04,971
Guys go crazy
for girls like you.

733
00:30:05,071 --> 00:30:06,238
Right.

734
00:30:06,338 --> 00:30:07,874
No, you watch.

735
00:30:07,974 --> 00:30:10,542
Your phone is going to
be ringing off the hook.

736
00:30:13,579 --> 00:30:16,382
Would it be too forward
to say I'm in the book?

737
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:18,885
No. no.
I'm in the book, too.

738
00:30:18,985 --> 00:30:20,920
Yeah.
we're all in the book.

739
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,588
You should drop by
sometime.

740
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:23,589
Really?

741
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,391
Sure. anytime.

742
00:30:28,127 --> 00:30:29,896
Well...

743
00:30:29,996 --> 00:30:31,297
I've got to get
to field three.

744
00:30:31,397 --> 00:30:32,965
Soccer.
excuse me.

745
00:30:33,065 --> 00:30:33,966
O.k. all right.

746
00:30:34,066 --> 00:30:35,834
Bye, Sheila.

747
00:30:39,105 --> 00:30:41,040
How do you like that?

748
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:44,610
Fort sumter may have to be
fired upon yet again.

749
00:30:45,878 --> 00:30:47,880
Hey! ho!

750
00:30:54,386 --> 00:30:56,255
That's my girl!

751
00:30:57,256 --> 00:30:58,490
Ha ha!

752
00:31:05,932 --> 00:31:07,199
Stay calm.

753
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:09,168
Control yourself.

754
00:31:09,268 --> 00:31:10,502
[Knocking]

755
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:12,438
You're late.

756
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:14,473
I'm not late.

757
00:31:14,573 --> 00:31:16,142
I told you 10:00.

758
00:31:16,242 --> 00:31:17,409
You said 10:30.

759
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:18,410
10:00.

760
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:19,778
10:00.
30!

761
00:31:19,946 --> 00:31:21,647
Never mind.
Where's Lindsay?

762
00:31:21,948 --> 00:31:23,349
She's sleeping.

763
00:31:23,449 --> 00:31:25,351
Oh, that's great.

764
00:31:25,451 --> 00:31:28,120
Grace, I specifically
asked you

765
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,156
to have her up
and ready.

766
00:31:30,256 --> 00:31:32,091
Now she's going to be
cranky the whole time.

767
00:31:32,191 --> 00:31:33,092
I'm sorry.

768
00:31:33,192 --> 00:31:34,160
I'll bet.

769
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,327
[Dog barking]

770
00:31:35,427 --> 00:31:36,963
Ditka!
it's you, boy!

771
00:31:37,029 --> 00:31:38,965
Are you happy
to see me, huh?

772
00:31:39,031 --> 00:31:40,766
Look what I got
for you. Huh?

773
00:31:40,967 --> 00:31:42,969
Yeah! ha ha ha!

774
00:31:43,002 --> 00:31:45,071
I should have married
you, shouldn't I?

775
00:31:45,171 --> 00:31:46,638
It's not too late.

776
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:51,210
O.k. I'm not going to make
a big speech or anything,

777
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:54,246
but I wanted to thank
mom and Phil

778
00:31:54,346 --> 00:31:55,247
for this great party
and everything.

779
00:31:55,347 --> 00:31:56,815
Thank you, guys.

780
00:31:57,016 --> 00:31:58,517
You really are the best.

781
00:31:58,617 --> 00:32:00,219
And thank you all
for coming,

782
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:02,088
and thank you
for the graduation presents.

783
00:32:02,188 --> 00:32:04,156
Oh, and my dad's
here, too.

784
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:05,891
Hi, dad.

785
00:32:05,992 --> 00:32:08,094
And I guess that's it.
Thank you.

786
00:32:08,194 --> 00:32:09,828
Thank you.

787
00:32:10,029 --> 00:32:11,097
O.k. right there,

788
00:32:11,197 --> 00:32:12,498
that's more than
she's spoken to me

789
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:14,000
in the last
five years.

790
00:32:14,066 --> 00:32:15,234
Don't worry.
She'll grow out of it.

791
00:32:15,334 --> 00:32:17,003
I know, I know.

792
00:32:17,069 --> 00:32:18,870
Might that be
in my lifetime?

793
00:32:19,005 --> 00:32:20,272
Because I would
like that.

794
00:32:20,372 --> 00:32:22,874
This is yours when
i pass on, dear.

795
00:32:23,009 --> 00:32:25,011
Yo, she's with
Phil's mother now.

796
00:32:25,077 --> 00:32:26,012
I don't want to
be involved in this.

797
00:32:26,078 --> 00:32:27,613
Oh, this must be
torture for you.

798
00:32:27,713 --> 00:32:30,016
Dave's mother
won't even speak to me.

799
00:32:30,082 --> 00:32:31,417
What would she
be to me, anyway?

800
00:32:31,517 --> 00:32:33,219
My ex-wife's
new husband's mother

801
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:34,186
would be what,

802
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:35,321
mother-in-law
once removed?

803
00:32:35,421 --> 00:32:36,488
Yeah.

804
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:39,358
Hey, you.

805
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:40,692
You were
terrific.

806
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,894
She was.
You were great, honey.

807
00:32:43,029 --> 00:32:46,132
Donny, you've met
Phil's mom Dorothy.

808
00:32:46,232 --> 00:32:47,433
Yes. Dorothy, hi.
How are you?

809
00:32:47,533 --> 00:32:49,035
Who is he?

810
00:32:49,101 --> 00:32:51,403
This is Emma's
birth father, remember?

811
00:32:51,503 --> 00:32:52,471
Huh?

812
00:32:52,571 --> 00:32:55,341
Birth father!
Birth father!

813
00:32:55,441 --> 00:32:56,408
Never mind.

814
00:32:56,508 --> 00:32:58,277
Never mind.

815
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,881
Ah! let's go see
Scotty and Mark.

816
00:33:03,049 --> 00:33:04,450
Yeah. you o.K.?
You need a drink?

817
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:05,484
No. fine, thank you.

818
00:33:05,584 --> 00:33:06,618
[Dorothy]
I'm just asking.

819
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:08,320
I'm not deaf.

820
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,056
So...

821
00:33:10,156 --> 00:33:12,724
So, how did it go
at Meg's last night?

822
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,593
The usual.
We sat up all night

823
00:33:14,693 --> 00:33:16,395
doing drugs and
cleaning our guns.

824
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:17,496
That's very cute.

825
00:33:17,596 --> 00:33:18,897
Thanks.

826
00:33:19,065 --> 00:33:20,299
Well, tonight, she's
going to do my hair,

827
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:21,933
so can I sleep
over again?

828
00:33:22,068 --> 00:33:24,203
Tonight? you're
graduating tomorrow.

829
00:33:24,303 --> 00:33:25,804
I was going to make
a big special deal

830
00:33:26,072 --> 00:33:27,173
for us tonight.

831
00:33:27,273 --> 00:33:28,640
What about my hair?

832
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,941
Meg can do your hair
tomorrow morning, right?

833
00:33:30,076 --> 00:33:31,777
That's not how
hair works, dad.

834
00:33:31,877 --> 00:33:34,180
You'd rather do your
hair than stay with me?

835
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,415
Honey, come see Margie.
Do you mind, Donny?

836
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:38,084
You know, actually,
i do, Phil.

837
00:33:38,184 --> 00:33:39,751
Can it wait
a minute, please?

838
00:33:40,086 --> 00:33:40,786
Dad.

839
00:33:41,087 --> 00:33:42,121
No. it's o.K.

840
00:33:42,221 --> 00:33:43,689
Thank you.

841
00:33:45,091 --> 00:33:45,791
Listen.

842
00:33:46,092 --> 00:33:47,126
I'm not--

843
00:33:47,226 --> 00:33:48,927
I'm not trying to
make you feel guilty.

844
00:33:49,095 --> 00:33:50,862
So I can't
sleep over?

845
00:33:51,097 --> 00:33:52,098
I didn't say that.

846
00:33:52,164 --> 00:33:53,099
So I can.

847
00:33:53,165 --> 00:33:54,100
I didn't
say that either.

848
00:33:54,166 --> 00:33:56,802
God, I hate it
when you do this!

849
00:33:57,103 --> 00:33:58,204
Forget it, o.K.?

850
00:33:58,304 --> 00:34:00,206
Forget my stupid hair.
Forget everything.

851
00:34:00,306 --> 00:34:01,707
Just forget it.

852
00:34:05,311 --> 00:34:07,246
What just
happened here?

853
00:34:07,346 --> 00:34:09,948
Ruff ruff ruff!

854
00:34:10,182 --> 00:34:11,217
Ruff ruff ruff!

855
00:34:11,317 --> 00:34:13,185
Here, boy.
Go on, boy. Here.

856
00:34:13,285 --> 00:34:15,154
Ruff ruff!

857
00:34:15,254 --> 00:34:17,256
[Barking]

858
00:34:17,356 --> 00:34:18,924
You want me
to wake her?

859
00:34:19,125 --> 00:34:20,626
No. I'll wait.

860
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:21,693
Where?

861
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:23,362
What do you mean,
where?

862
00:34:23,462 --> 00:34:24,763
I don't know
if I feel comfortable--

863
00:34:24,863 --> 00:34:26,765
what? you want me
to wait outside?

864
00:34:26,865 --> 00:34:28,167
If you don't mind.

865
00:34:28,267 --> 00:34:29,701
I don't fucking
believe this.

866
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:31,637
Don't you talk like that
in front of my dog.

867
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:32,838
Your dog?

868
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:34,140
That's right.

869
00:34:34,206 --> 00:34:35,974
That's my dog.
I found that dog.

870
00:34:36,142 --> 00:34:37,143
You didn't find him.
I found him.

871
00:34:37,243 --> 00:34:39,245
I found him.
I named him.

872
00:34:39,345 --> 00:34:40,312
He's my dog.

873
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:41,713
I found him.
I named him.

874
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:44,350
You renamed him.
He's still my dog!

875
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:45,751
[Whimpering]

876
00:34:45,851 --> 00:34:47,219
Ditka knows
whose dog he is,

877
00:34:47,319 --> 00:34:48,720
don't you, boy?
Yes, he does!

878
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:51,857
Come on. We'll go outside
and play...Together.

879
00:34:51,957 --> 00:34:54,059
Don't forget you're
dropping Lindsay off

880
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,394
at my folks'
this afternoon.

881
00:34:55,494 --> 00:34:56,662
I'll be out of town.

882
00:34:56,762 --> 00:34:59,298
Right. what is there,
a witches convention?

883
00:35:02,868 --> 00:35:05,304
Oh, what do you know?

884
00:35:05,404 --> 00:35:08,774
I see the unemployment
poster boy is here.

885
00:35:08,874 --> 00:35:10,776
Gerald is a very good
friend of mine, Vic.

886
00:35:10,876 --> 00:35:12,010
I think it's time

887
00:35:12,178 --> 00:35:12,944
you showed him
a little more respect.

888
00:35:13,179 --> 00:35:14,280
I don't think

889
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,647
he should be allowed
out there on the porch.

890
00:35:15,747 --> 00:35:16,815
Mommy!

891
00:35:16,915 --> 00:35:18,317
Coming, honey.
That's ridiculous.

892
00:35:18,417 --> 00:35:20,719
I built that porch
myself, grace,

893
00:35:20,819 --> 00:35:22,188
on weekends,
holidays.

894
00:35:22,288 --> 00:35:24,523
I nailed it.
I sanded it.

895
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:26,792
I don't think Gerald
should be out there.

896
00:35:26,892 --> 00:35:29,060
I'm telling you,
that's my porch!

897
00:35:29,195 --> 00:35:31,263
He shouldn't
be on it.

898
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:10,001
Hi.

899
00:36:10,269 --> 00:36:11,370
Hi.

900
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:13,739
You o.K.?

901
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:16,275
Yeah. I just had
to get out of there

902
00:36:16,375 --> 00:36:17,276
for a second.

903
00:36:17,376 --> 00:36:19,245
I don't blame you.

904
00:36:19,311 --> 00:36:20,679
You don't smoke,
do you?

905
00:36:20,779 --> 00:36:22,648
I'm trying to start.

906
00:36:22,748 --> 00:36:24,516
O.k.

907
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:28,254
That might not be
the best thing for you.

908
00:36:28,354 --> 00:36:30,256
I'm not sure.

909
00:36:30,322 --> 00:36:32,258
I smoked freshman year
in college.

910
00:36:32,324 --> 00:36:33,792
I was unbelievably happy.

911
00:36:33,892 --> 00:36:37,296
I've been thinking maybe
it was the cigarettes.

912
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,269
I don't think so.

913
00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:44,636
Hmm. o.K.

914
00:36:44,736 --> 00:36:46,372
Blech!

915
00:36:46,472 --> 00:36:47,739
The truth is,

916
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:49,275
I'm just not very good
at this divorce thing.

917
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:50,809
Oh, nobody's
good at it.

918
00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:53,312
You are. You and Dave
have a great divorce.

919
00:36:53,412 --> 00:36:55,281
Seriously,
your divorce is better

920
00:36:55,314 --> 00:36:56,648
than most people's
marriages.

921
00:36:56,748 --> 00:36:59,184
No. we're just better
at hiding stuff,

922
00:36:59,285 --> 00:37:00,419
which is worse,
actually.

923
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:02,321
Sometimes I just want
to scream or something.

924
00:37:02,421 --> 00:37:05,291
Really? because
you seem so together.

925
00:37:05,357 --> 00:37:06,292
Right.

926
00:37:06,358 --> 00:37:07,393
No. I always
think of you,

927
00:37:07,493 --> 00:37:09,461
you're like this magazine
ad woman, you know,

928
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:11,963
with the perfect hair
and the beautiful children,

929
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:15,501
this supreme court justice
olympic champion combo.

930
00:37:15,601 --> 00:37:16,635
How about
late for car pool,

931
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:18,704
always exhausted,
underpaid at work,

932
00:37:18,804 --> 00:37:21,540
and hair
a constant disaster?

933
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,809
No, that's not you.

934
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:27,646
See, I would not have
gone for the divorce.

935
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:29,648
That was really
Claire's idea.

936
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:31,350
I mean, I knew
i was unhappy

937
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:32,551
and she was unhappy

938
00:37:32,651 --> 00:37:34,553
and that
it wasn't working.

939
00:37:34,653 --> 00:37:36,622
I mean, I was sleeping
in the bathtub,

940
00:37:36,722 --> 00:37:39,691
but I really thought
this is it. You know,

941
00:37:39,791 --> 00:37:41,827
if you're married
and you have kids,

942
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:43,662
work it out.

943
00:37:46,798 --> 00:37:49,067
You knew Dave
was fooling around,

944
00:37:49,335 --> 00:37:50,536
didn't you?

945
00:37:57,676 --> 00:38:00,746
You were my friend,
too, Donny.

946
00:38:05,351 --> 00:38:06,652
I know.

947
00:38:06,752 --> 00:38:09,721
But first loyalty
is always to the guys,

948
00:38:09,821 --> 00:38:11,590
right?

949
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:17,228
I guess.
I don't know.

950
00:38:17,363 --> 00:38:19,631
That was the problem
with Dave.

951
00:38:19,731 --> 00:38:22,568
I could never
get him to love me

952
00:38:22,668 --> 00:38:24,703
as much as he loved
you and Vic.

953
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:28,674
Dave knows that
he will never find

954
00:38:28,774 --> 00:38:30,642
anybody
as great as you.

955
00:38:31,743 --> 00:38:32,778
Does he?

956
00:38:32,878 --> 00:38:34,380
I do.

957
00:38:38,116 --> 00:38:40,619
We should get back, huh?

958
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:42,588
Yeah.

959
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:44,656
[Dave]
o.k., dads. We've made it

960
00:38:44,756 --> 00:38:45,757
through four museums, six parks,

961
00:38:45,857 --> 00:38:47,593
and lunch with no fights,
no tantrums,

962
00:38:47,693 --> 00:38:48,627
and nobody's thrown up.

963
00:38:48,727 --> 00:38:50,295
Let's not get
overconfident.

964
00:38:50,396 --> 00:38:51,763
It's our only day
with the kids,

965
00:38:51,863 --> 00:38:53,599
and we've got to get
everything in.

966
00:38:53,699 --> 00:38:55,266
We start the afternoon
with rollerblades.

967
00:38:55,401 --> 00:38:57,769
After that, we head over
to travel town for a train ride.

968
00:38:57,869 --> 00:39:00,138
Then we take the i-10 to
bandini's magic and novelty shop

969
00:39:00,406 --> 00:39:01,407
for a little magic.

970
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,442
Then we go due east
to the petting zoo.

971
00:39:03,542 --> 00:39:04,976
No. not the
petting zoo again.

972
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:06,244
We go there
too much.

973
00:39:06,412 --> 00:39:08,614
Last time, one sheep
called me by name.

974
00:39:08,714 --> 00:39:11,583
The kids love it.
Deal with it, Mike.

975
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:12,784
Fine, fine.

976
00:39:12,884 --> 00:39:14,753
We keep moving,
we should be home by 6:15,

977
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:16,822
and that includes one trip
to the emergency room,

978
00:39:16,922 --> 00:39:18,056
but only one.

979
00:39:18,156 --> 00:39:19,758
Wagons all loaded,
Dave.

980
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:21,760
Ready to roll.

981
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,963
O.k. let's move 'em out!

982
00:39:33,772 --> 00:39:35,907
Yee-ha!

983
00:39:38,176 --> 00:39:40,679

00:39:40,779 --> 00:39:43,549

993
00:40:03,702 --> 00:40:04,736

00:40:04,836 --> 00:40:08,540

1002
00:40:30,729 --> 00:40:31,897
afternoon, ladies.

1003
00:40:31,997 --> 00:40:33,665
Hi.
hi.

1004
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:35,867
Just go up
and order something.

1005
00:40:35,967 --> 00:40:37,102
You do it.

1006
00:40:37,202 --> 00:40:39,004
He's so cute.

1007
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:41,873
Go. there's nobody
up there. Go now.

1008
00:40:41,973 --> 00:40:43,842
Go now. Go, go.

1009
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:46,778
Hello.

1010
00:40:46,878 --> 00:40:48,747
May i
take your order?

1011
00:40:48,847 --> 00:40:49,881
Um...

1012
00:40:49,981 --> 00:40:51,750
Well, I can take it
from here, Walter.

1013
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:53,118
What's your pleasure?

1014
00:40:53,218 --> 00:40:54,786
Um...

1015
00:40:54,886 --> 00:40:57,823
Two hot cocoas,
please.

1016
00:40:57,923 --> 00:40:58,890
Can I see some I.D.?

1017
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:00,692
Ha ha!
Ha ha!

1018
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:02,728
You are old enough to
drink cocoa, aren't you?

1019
00:41:02,828 --> 00:41:04,696
I'm 17.
Me, too.

1020
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:05,831
Two hot chocs,
Walter.

1021
00:41:05,931 --> 00:41:06,865
Coming up.

1022
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:08,734
Max,
one order of fries

1023
00:41:08,834 --> 00:41:10,769
and fresh horses
for my men!

1024
00:41:10,869 --> 00:41:12,638
Take it easy, Mike.
You're yelling.

1025
00:41:12,738 --> 00:41:14,640
Now, listen, listen.
My dad's going out of town.

1026
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:16,642
He's taking my mom
and my little sister.

1027
00:41:16,742 --> 00:41:19,077
The house is mine.
You know what that means?

1028
00:41:19,177 --> 00:41:20,846
Party!

1029
00:41:20,946 --> 00:41:22,714
Party! party!

1030
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:23,949
Ha ha ha!

1031
00:41:24,049 --> 00:41:26,251
Oh, wow.
Bring your girlfriends.

1032
00:41:26,552 --> 00:41:27,653
There we go.

1033
00:41:27,753 --> 00:41:31,923
Ha! party!
Ha ha! Woo-hoo!

1034
00:41:32,023 --> 00:41:34,125
So, I guess I'll
see you tonight.

1035
00:41:40,098 --> 00:41:42,668
What's daddy's
favorite team?

1036
00:41:42,768 --> 00:41:44,202
Red Sox!

1037
00:41:44,302 --> 00:41:46,805
Yeah!
that-a-girl!

1038
00:41:46,905 --> 00:41:47,973
[Gagging]

1039
00:41:48,073 --> 00:41:49,808
What's the matter,
Lindsay?

1040
00:41:49,908 --> 00:41:51,577
What's the matter,
sweetheart?

1041
00:41:54,913 --> 00:41:56,715
Red Sox!
right.

1042
00:41:56,815 --> 00:41:58,650
[Kids]
can we play miniature golf?

1043
00:41:58,750 --> 00:41:59,651
[Dave]
nope. we got to get home.

1044
00:41:59,751 --> 00:42:00,952
Kim's making us
a special dinner.

1045
00:42:01,052 --> 00:42:04,623
Ice cream is a good idea.
Miniature golf.

1046
00:42:04,723 --> 00:42:05,724
Nice car.

1047
00:42:05,824 --> 00:42:06,758
You think?

1048
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:08,727
My ex thinks
it's too much.

1049
00:42:08,827 --> 00:42:10,662
No.
it's beautiful.

1050
00:42:10,762 --> 00:42:12,764
I appreciate
beautiful things.

1051
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:13,999
Sue me.

1052
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:15,967
Beautiful,
fast things.

1053
00:42:16,067 --> 00:42:17,703
Beautiful, fast
German things.

1054
00:42:17,803 --> 00:42:19,638
It's Heidi, right?

1055
00:42:19,738 --> 00:42:21,039
Heidi schmidt.

1056
00:42:21,139 --> 00:42:23,742
Jonathan's mother.
Center halfback.

1057
00:42:23,842 --> 00:42:25,210
Ben's dad.
Right wing.

1058
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:26,645
It's good
to see you.

1059
00:42:26,745 --> 00:42:27,713
Good to see you.

1060
00:42:27,813 --> 00:42:29,781
Don't
see you enough.

1061
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:31,783
We should see
each other more.

1062
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:33,919
I'm in
the roster book.

1063
00:42:36,855 --> 00:42:39,825
* this little girl
of mine *

1064
00:42:39,925 --> 00:42:41,860
* I want you people
to know *

1065
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:45,764
* that this little girl
of mine *

1066
00:42:45,864 --> 00:42:47,933
* I take her
everywhere I go *

1067
00:42:48,033 --> 00:42:49,668
* one day,
i looked at my suit *

1068
00:42:49,768 --> 00:42:50,836
* my suit was new

1069
00:42:50,936 --> 00:42:52,237
* I looked at my shoes

1070
00:42:52,337 --> 00:42:53,739
* and they were, too

1071
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:55,006
* and that's why

1072
00:42:55,106 --> 00:42:56,207
* why

1073
00:42:56,307 --> 00:42:58,977
* why, why...

1074
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:01,813
Now, remember, honey,
almost everything

1075
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:03,649
grandma and grandpa
say about daddy

1076
00:43:03,715 --> 00:43:04,883
is not true, o.K.?

1077
00:43:04,983 --> 00:43:08,720
Not true, not true,
not true, not true!

1078
00:43:11,289 --> 00:43:13,091
Here we go.

1079
00:43:13,191 --> 00:43:15,093
There they are!

1080
00:43:15,193 --> 00:43:16,762
Hi, Vic.

1081
00:43:16,862 --> 00:43:19,731
Hey, Tom,
Isabelle.

1082
00:43:19,831 --> 00:43:20,799
Hello, Victor.

1083
00:43:20,899 --> 00:43:23,068
How's
my sweetie?

1084
00:43:23,168 --> 00:43:24,770
We had
a big day today,

1085
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:26,905
but maybe she had
one too many hot dogs,

1086
00:43:27,005 --> 00:43:29,675
so I'd watch her with
the sweets and stuff.

1087
00:43:29,708 --> 00:43:30,909
You didn't
feel good, honey?

1088
00:43:31,009 --> 00:43:32,110
Mm-mm.

1089
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:33,779
O.k., pookie.

1090
00:43:33,879 --> 00:43:35,814
Daddy's going to
say bye-bye now.

1091
00:43:35,914 --> 00:43:38,149
O.k.? give me a hug?

1092
00:43:38,249 --> 00:43:40,085
Aw...

1093
00:43:43,154 --> 00:43:45,691
O.k.

1094
00:43:45,757 --> 00:43:46,892
No, daddy!

1095
00:43:46,992 --> 00:43:48,927
Oh, no,
sweetheart.

1096
00:43:49,027 --> 00:43:51,697
She'll be o.K.
After I leave.

1097
00:43:51,797 --> 00:43:53,699
I want
my daddy!

1098
00:43:53,765 --> 00:43:57,168
Oh. here's her bag.

1099
00:43:57,268 --> 00:43:58,236
Thanks.

1100
00:43:58,336 --> 00:43:59,504
Bye-bye, honey.

1101
00:43:59,738 --> 00:44:01,206
Daddy!

1102
00:44:02,974 --> 00:44:04,710
Bye-bye.

1103
00:44:14,953 --> 00:44:17,422
There you are, ma'am.
Thanks very much.

1104
00:44:17,522 --> 00:44:19,124
Hey, Walter. You
can call it a day.

1105
00:44:19,224 --> 00:44:20,125
Your shift's over.

1106
00:44:20,225 --> 00:44:21,392
Is it? Already?

1107
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:22,994
Time flies when you're
selling fries, huh?

1108
00:44:23,094 --> 00:44:23,995
Yeah. ha ha ha!

1109
00:44:24,095 --> 00:44:25,063
Listen. I'll do
a double shift.

1110
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:26,097
I don't mind.

1111
00:44:26,197 --> 00:44:27,132
What are you
trying to be--

1112
00:44:27,232 --> 00:44:28,166
employee
of the month?

1113
00:44:28,266 --> 00:44:30,969
This is your second
day. Go on home.

1114
00:44:31,069 --> 00:44:32,003
[Beep]

1115
00:44:32,103 --> 00:44:33,972
I'll take
this one order, o.K.?

1116
00:44:34,072 --> 00:44:36,808
Ha ha! You're
a fanatic, man.

1117
00:44:36,908 --> 00:44:39,778
Welcome to McDonald's.
May I take your order?

1118
00:44:39,878 --> 00:44:41,112
It's me, Walt--Max.

1119
00:44:41,212 --> 00:44:43,148
Get out of there, man.
Your shift's over.

1120
00:44:43,248 --> 00:44:46,217
Come on out.
I'll give you a ride home.

1121
00:44:48,086 --> 00:44:50,021
Hop in, Walt.
Your chariot awaits.

1122
00:44:50,121 --> 00:44:52,758
That's a '75
Plymouth Valiant.

1123
00:44:52,824 --> 00:44:53,759
That's right.

1124
00:44:53,859 --> 00:44:55,526
I built
your transmission.

1125
00:44:55,761 --> 00:44:56,594
Nice job.

1126
00:44:56,795 --> 00:44:58,764
Good transmission.

1127
00:45:12,844 --> 00:45:14,245
Cool plane.

1128
00:45:14,345 --> 00:45:15,781
Nah,
she was a dog.

1129
00:45:15,881 --> 00:45:17,515
I lost her
over France.

1130
00:45:17,783 --> 00:45:18,549
You got
shot down?

1131
00:45:18,784 --> 00:45:19,785
Just once.

1132
00:45:19,851 --> 00:45:21,286
How come old guys
drink tea?

1133
00:45:21,386 --> 00:45:22,520
Did you drink tea
when you were young?

1134
00:45:22,788 --> 00:45:24,856
Uh, no.
Not much.

1135
00:45:24,956 --> 00:45:26,324
One day you say,
"I'm getting older now.

1136
00:45:26,424 --> 00:45:27,859
I better
start drinking tea"?

1137
00:45:27,959 --> 00:45:29,094
Yeah.
that's the rules.

1138
00:45:29,194 --> 00:45:30,528
You get old,
you drink tea,

1139
00:45:30,796 --> 00:45:31,629
and the word
"regular"

1140
00:45:31,797 --> 00:45:34,165
takes on a whole
new meaning.

1141
00:45:34,265 --> 00:45:35,700
Wow.

1142
00:45:35,801 --> 00:45:38,236
Is that your wife?
She's pretty.

1143
00:45:38,336 --> 00:45:39,404
Yeah.
that was taken

1144
00:45:39,504 --> 00:45:40,806
just before
we were married.

1145
00:45:40,872 --> 00:45:42,607
How long
you been married?

1146
00:45:42,841 --> 00:45:44,142
48 years.

1147
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:46,211
Oh, I'm sorry
it didn't work out.

1148
00:45:46,311 --> 00:45:47,946
Yeah. ha ha!

1149
00:45:48,046 --> 00:45:49,147
Yeah.

1150
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:52,017
She passed away
a couple years ago.

1151
00:45:53,819 --> 00:45:55,653
This is my son
Walter Jr. here.

1152
00:45:55,821 --> 00:45:58,556
He's a real-estate
broker in key west.

1153
00:45:58,824 --> 00:45:59,825
And that's Angela,

1154
00:45:59,858 --> 00:46:01,059
a schoolteacher
in Michigan.

1155
00:46:01,159 --> 00:46:03,261
Your kids
come out here much?

1156
00:46:03,361 --> 00:46:04,695
No. not much.

1157
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:06,832
People get busy,
you know.

1158
00:46:06,898 --> 00:46:08,133
I got a card

1159
00:46:08,233 --> 00:46:10,201
from Walter Jr.,
though, this week.

1160
00:46:11,937 --> 00:46:13,972
He sold
another condo.

1161
00:46:14,072 --> 00:46:16,908
Last year,
he won a buick.

1162
00:46:19,344 --> 00:46:21,980
What about you?
Brothers and sisters?

1163
00:46:23,114 --> 00:46:24,649
Uh-huh.

1164
00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:26,684
I've got a brother.

1165
00:46:26,918 --> 00:46:27,986
Half brother.

1166
00:46:28,086 --> 00:46:30,856
Don't see him
that much.

1167
00:46:30,922 --> 00:46:34,159
He's sort of in
and out of my life.

1168
00:46:37,863 --> 00:46:38,864
I don't know.

1169
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:41,032
He's kind
of messed up.

1170
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:42,367
Oh.

1171
00:46:44,903 --> 00:46:46,872
Well, here's to your new
career at Mickey d's.

1172
00:46:46,938 --> 00:46:47,906
O.k.

1173
00:46:48,006 --> 00:46:49,240
And to
your dog airplane

1174
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:51,877
and your smart kids
and your pretty wife.

1175
00:46:51,977 --> 00:46:53,979
Well, here's
to my new boss.

1176
00:47:03,889 --> 00:47:04,990
Hey, Walter.

1177
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:06,724
You want to go
to a party tonight?

1178
00:47:06,925 --> 00:47:10,728
* our house *

1179
00:47:10,896 --> 00:47:13,899
* is a very, very,
very fine house *

1180
00:47:13,999 --> 00:47:17,102
* with two cats
in the yard *

1181
00:47:17,202 --> 00:47:20,906
* life used to
be so hard *

1182
00:47:21,006 --> 00:47:27,478
* now everything is easy
'cause of you *

1183
00:47:27,578 --> 00:47:31,082

1189
00:47:49,935 --> 00:47:52,070
yes!

1190
00:47:54,139 --> 00:47:56,207
31 hours and counting.

1191
00:47:56,307 --> 00:47:59,044
We're talking a divorce
a minute in this country.

1192
00:47:59,144 --> 00:48:02,780
You get married today,
your chances of staying together

1193
00:48:02,948 --> 00:48:05,283
are less than your chances
of surviving a shark attack.

1194
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:08,653
After the divorce,
suicide, depression,

1195
00:48:08,753 --> 00:48:11,689
alcoholism,
drug addiction, obesity--

1196
00:48:11,957 --> 00:48:13,158
they all increase.

1197
00:48:13,258 --> 00:48:15,560
Divorced Americans
are the most unhappy people

1198
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:17,062
in the world,

1199
00:48:17,162 --> 00:48:19,965
with the possible exception
of married scandinavians,

1200
00:48:20,031 --> 00:48:21,967
but, hey, it doesn't
have to be this way.

1201
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,969
You can take control
of your life.

1202
00:48:24,069 --> 00:48:24,970
You can be happy.

1203
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:26,337
Say it with me.

1204
00:48:26,437 --> 00:48:28,239
I can be happy,
Dr. townsend.

1205
00:48:28,339 --> 00:48:30,108
I can be happy,
Dr. townsend.

1206
00:48:30,208 --> 00:48:32,010
Come on.
Say it one more time,

1207
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:33,244
louder with feeling.

1208
00:48:33,344 --> 00:48:34,980
I can be happy,
Dr. townsend.

1209
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:36,647
Believe it
because it's true.

1210
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:39,117
It may not happen tonight.
It may not happen tomorrow.

1211
00:48:39,217 --> 00:48:40,986
It may not happen
next week.

1212
00:48:41,019 --> 00:48:43,421
It may not happen
next Thursday.

1213
00:48:43,521 --> 00:48:46,057
It may not happen
a week from now.

1214
00:48:46,157 --> 00:48:48,226
It may not happen--

1215
00:48:48,326 --> 00:48:50,328
bingo.

1216
00:48:51,562 --> 00:48:53,598
* hmm

1217
00:48:53,698 --> 00:48:55,300
* ahh

1218
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,468
* na na na na na

1219
00:48:57,568 --> 00:49:00,605
[whistles]

1220
00:49:00,705 --> 00:49:01,606
How's it coming?

1221
00:49:01,706 --> 00:49:03,408
Not yet.

1222
00:49:04,709 --> 00:49:06,477
Well, how's
it look?

1223
00:49:06,577 --> 00:49:07,745
We're never
going to eat.

1224
00:49:08,013 --> 00:49:09,114
Nothing was cooked?

1225
00:49:09,214 --> 00:49:10,115
Nope.

1226
00:49:10,215 --> 00:49:12,417
I'm hungry, daddy.

1227
00:49:12,517 --> 00:49:13,684
All right. Hang on.

1228
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:15,120
A friend comes over
to make us a special meal,

1229
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:17,655
you can't expect her just
to throw something together.

1230
00:49:17,755 --> 00:49:19,590
Why not? You do.
Watch it.

1231
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:22,593
I liked it when
Lydia came to cook.

1232
00:49:22,693 --> 00:49:24,229
She made hot dogs.

1233
00:49:24,329 --> 00:49:25,863
That wasn't Lydia.
It was Karen.

1234
00:49:26,064 --> 00:49:28,033
No.
it was Jennifer.

1235
00:49:28,099 --> 00:49:29,667
No, no.
It was Lydia.

1236
00:49:29,767 --> 00:49:31,602
You should
get them name tags.

1237
00:49:31,702 --> 00:49:33,104
It would make it
a lot easier for us.

1238
00:49:33,204 --> 00:49:35,040
* na na na na

1239
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:37,142
this is crazy.
What am I doing?

1240
00:49:37,242 --> 00:49:38,509
I shouldn't even be
going out tonight.

1241
00:49:38,609 --> 00:49:40,178
I never would have
made this date

1242
00:49:40,278 --> 00:49:42,047
if I knew I had
you guys this weekend.

1243
00:49:42,113 --> 00:49:42,913
Here, jed.
Put this away.

1244
00:49:43,114 --> 00:49:44,715
Dad, you've
had two dates

1245
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:45,650
in the last
eight months.

1246
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:46,717
Three.

1247
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:48,853
Not counting
cousin Marilyn.

1248
00:49:49,054 --> 00:49:49,954
You're going out,

1249
00:49:50,055 --> 00:49:50,955
you're having
a great time,

1250
00:49:51,056 --> 00:49:52,923
and you look
incredibly handsome.

1251
00:49:53,058 --> 00:49:54,359
Thank you,
daughter.

1252
00:49:54,459 --> 00:49:55,693
Look good, dad.

1253
00:49:55,793 --> 00:49:56,894
Thank you, son.

1254
00:49:57,062 --> 00:49:58,496
Come on.
Give me a hug.

1255
00:49:58,596 --> 00:49:59,530
Love you.

1256
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:01,432
Go on.
Get out of here.

1257
00:50:01,532 --> 00:50:03,901
Oh, oh. Where you
taking her tonight?

1258
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:07,038
Well, I made reservations
at two places--

1259
00:50:07,138 --> 00:50:10,275
Chez Henri, a French place
on 14th, if it looks promising,

1260
00:50:10,375 --> 00:50:13,411
umberto's for Italian
if it looks like a bomb.

1261
00:50:14,645 --> 00:50:16,614
Hi. you must be Victor.

1262
00:50:16,714 --> 00:50:18,683
Yeah. I, uh...
I must.

1263
00:50:18,783 --> 00:50:20,651
Great. I'll
just be a second.

1264
00:50:20,751 --> 00:50:22,053
Nice place.

1265
00:50:22,153 --> 00:50:23,288
Yes. thank you.

1266
00:50:23,388 --> 00:50:24,955
Buying this place
was the only smart thing

1267
00:50:25,056 --> 00:50:27,592
that son of a bitch
ex-husband of mine ever did.

1268
00:50:27,692 --> 00:50:30,561
Um, listen, Victor.

1269
00:50:30,661 --> 00:50:33,264
I don't smoke,
i don't drink,

1270
00:50:33,364 --> 00:50:35,566
and no sexual activity
on the first date.

1271
00:50:35,666 --> 00:50:37,568
O.k.

1272
00:50:38,603 --> 00:50:40,838
Do you like
Italian food?

1273
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:43,941
Ladies and gentlemen,

1274
00:50:44,142 --> 00:50:45,576
for your dining pleasure,

1275
00:50:45,676 --> 00:50:47,712
grilled ahi
a la Kim.

1276
00:50:47,812 --> 00:50:49,080
Well, look at this.

1277
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:50,581
This is beautiful!

1278
00:50:50,681 --> 00:50:51,582
Thank you.

1279
00:50:51,682 --> 00:50:52,650
Wow!

1280
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:53,918
Whoa, whoa.
Wait a minute.

1281
00:50:54,152 --> 00:50:55,153
That's fish.

1282
00:50:55,253 --> 00:50:57,122
Yeah. you said
you like fish.

1283
00:50:57,222 --> 00:50:59,724
He doesn't like fish.
He loves fish.

1284
00:50:59,824 --> 00:51:02,360
I like fish sticks,
not fish fish.

1285
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:05,263
You remember the fish that
we caught at lake kachuma.

1286
00:51:05,363 --> 00:51:06,531
You ate that.

1287
00:51:06,631 --> 00:51:07,732
That
was different.

1288
00:51:07,832 --> 00:51:09,834
Yeah. that was a
disgusting little mud fish.

1289
00:51:09,934 --> 00:51:12,637
This is a fantastic
grilled ahi with lime sauce

1290
00:51:12,737 --> 00:51:14,839
and a sprig of--
what the heck is this?

1291
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:15,873
Cilantro.

1292
00:51:16,141 --> 00:51:17,642
Cilantro.

1293
00:51:17,742 --> 00:51:19,377
I don't care.
I'm not eating it.

1294
00:51:23,281 --> 00:51:24,749
You know what, Ben?

1295
00:51:24,849 --> 00:51:26,484
I'm going to
make you a hamburger.

1296
00:51:26,584 --> 00:51:27,985
It'll
just take a sec.

1297
00:51:28,153 --> 00:51:29,420
No, it's o.K.
He's going to have the fish.

1298
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,656
It's not
a problem, really.

1299
00:51:31,756 --> 00:51:34,559
I don't want
a burger either.

1300
00:51:34,659 --> 00:51:36,361
Oh, you're not
going to eat at all now.

1301
00:51:36,461 --> 00:51:37,628
Can I call
mommy?

1302
00:51:37,728 --> 00:51:38,763
No, no.
We're having dinner now.

1303
00:51:38,863 --> 00:51:40,598
Can I call mommy?

1304
00:51:40,698 --> 00:51:41,932
No. no calling mommy.

1305
00:51:42,167 --> 00:51:43,067
Let them call.

1306
00:51:43,168 --> 00:51:44,169
Kim,
I'm handling this.

1307
00:51:44,235 --> 00:51:45,303
Don't get mad at me!

1308
00:51:45,403 --> 00:51:47,705
I'm not getting mad
at anybody...Yet.

1309
00:51:47,805 --> 00:51:50,508
I just want to have
a nice dinner.

1310
00:51:50,608 --> 00:51:51,509
That's all.

1311
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:52,510
[Doorbell rings]

1312
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:54,479
I'll get it.

1313
00:51:57,215 --> 00:51:58,883
Mmm.

1314
00:52:00,685 --> 00:52:02,320
Hmm.

1315
00:52:05,623 --> 00:52:06,591
Heidi.

1316
00:52:06,691 --> 00:52:07,625
Hi.

1317
00:52:07,725 --> 00:52:08,726
Hi.

1318
00:52:08,826 --> 00:52:10,195
Jonathan wanted
to see Ben,

1319
00:52:10,261 --> 00:52:11,196
and I wanted to
see you.

1320
00:52:11,296 --> 00:52:12,797
We thought potluck.

1321
00:52:12,897 --> 00:52:14,265
Oh.

1322
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,501
Come on!

1323
00:52:16,601 --> 00:52:17,968
Jonathan!
Jonathan!

1324
00:52:18,203 --> 00:52:20,605
Oh, I'm sorry.

1325
00:52:20,705 --> 00:52:22,640
Is this
a bad time?

1326
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:24,242
Heh heh.

1327
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:30,981
Enjoy your meal.

1328
00:52:31,216 --> 00:52:33,984
[Coughing]

1329
00:52:34,219 --> 00:52:36,221
I'm o.K.

1330
00:52:40,291 --> 00:52:42,293
Oh, I'm sorry.

1331
00:52:53,238 --> 00:52:54,672
Great.

1332
00:53:04,882 --> 00:53:06,684
You o.K.?

1333
00:53:06,784 --> 00:53:08,853
Hairball.

1334
00:53:08,953 --> 00:53:11,456
[Coughing]

1335
00:53:12,957 --> 00:53:14,992
[Clears throat]

1336
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:16,461
This is not, like,

1337
00:53:16,561 --> 00:53:17,795
your first time in
a restaurant, is it?

1338
00:53:17,895 --> 00:53:20,598
No. my ex-husband used to
like to eat out all the time,

1339
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:21,999
may he rest in peace.

1340
00:53:22,267 --> 00:53:23,501
Oh,
he passed away?

1341
00:53:23,601 --> 00:53:24,902
Not yet.

1342
00:53:28,906 --> 00:53:30,608
[Coughing]

1343
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:32,543
We may need
another minute.

1344
00:53:32,643 --> 00:53:33,744
O.k.

1345
00:53:33,844 --> 00:53:35,446
[Clears throat]

1346
00:54:20,024 --> 00:54:21,826
How is it--good?

1347
00:54:21,926 --> 00:54:23,994
It's o.K.

1348
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:26,564
You know, I got
the recipe from Vic.

1349
00:54:26,664 --> 00:54:28,566
Oh.

1350
00:54:28,666 --> 00:54:29,567
Yup.

1351
00:54:29,667 --> 00:54:31,569
Funny. I used to
trade baseball cards.

1352
00:54:31,669 --> 00:54:33,571
Now I'm trading
recipes.

1353
00:54:40,077 --> 00:54:41,912
Hey, that was
some brunch today.

1354
00:54:42,012 --> 00:54:43,614
It was o.K.

1355
00:54:43,714 --> 00:54:45,115
What did you do
after the brunch?

1356
00:54:45,350 --> 00:54:46,451
Nothing.

1357
00:54:46,551 --> 00:54:47,718
You must have
done something.

1358
00:54:47,818 --> 00:54:49,787
Not actually.

1359
00:54:51,689 --> 00:54:53,591
See, what
i was doing there

1360
00:54:53,691 --> 00:54:55,460
was trying
to make conversation.

1361
00:55:02,767 --> 00:55:05,570
Did I tell you
I'm thinking of taking
in a partner at work?

1362
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:07,638
Yeah. because the whole
real estate market

1363
00:55:07,738 --> 00:55:09,006
is starting
to pick up again,

1364
00:55:09,106 --> 00:55:10,508
so I was thinking

1365
00:55:10,608 --> 00:55:13,678
if I have a mortgage broker
in the office, you know.

1366
00:55:13,778 --> 00:55:14,945
Remember Joe Farrell?

1367
00:55:15,045 --> 00:55:16,581
Not really.

1368
00:55:16,681 --> 00:55:17,848
Joe...

1369
00:55:17,948 --> 00:55:19,984
Farrell.

1370
00:55:20,084 --> 00:55:22,487
Joe Farrell.

1371
00:55:22,587 --> 00:55:24,589
Remember we used to go
to those great barbecues?

1372
00:55:24,689 --> 00:55:26,557
He had that cottage
at lake arrowhead.

1373
00:55:26,657 --> 00:55:29,860
You must remember
Joe Farrell.

1374
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:32,029
O.k. I know Joe.

1375
00:55:32,129 --> 00:55:34,732
He used to come to
the house all the time

1376
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:35,866
when we lived
on Perth street.

1377
00:55:35,966 --> 00:55:37,902
Oh, the good
old days.

1378
00:55:38,002 --> 00:55:39,804
What?

1379
00:55:39,904 --> 00:55:40,871
Before the flood.

1380
00:55:40,971 --> 00:55:42,106
That's what
mom calls it.

1381
00:55:42,407 --> 00:55:44,241
Really?

1382
00:55:44,409 --> 00:55:46,010
That's
what she calls it?

1383
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:48,613
We were
so terribly happy.

1384
00:55:48,713 --> 00:55:50,615
The Perth street
paradise.

1385
00:55:50,715 --> 00:55:52,850
I think we were
pretty happy
on Perth street.

1386
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:54,752
Whatever.

1387
00:55:54,852 --> 00:55:57,622
You weren't happy
on Perth street?

1388
00:55:57,722 --> 00:55:59,524
I don't want to
talk about it.

1389
00:55:59,624 --> 00:56:00,558
Why not?

1390
00:56:00,658 --> 00:56:02,026
Because when
we talk about it,

1391
00:56:02,126 --> 00:56:03,861
we don't really
talk about it,

1392
00:56:03,961 --> 00:56:05,162
so let's just not.

1393
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:06,531
I want to talk
about it.

1394
00:56:06,631 --> 00:56:07,632
Well, I don't.

1395
00:56:07,732 --> 00:56:08,633
We're having dinner.

1396
00:56:08,733 --> 00:56:10,601
I'm your dad.
We can talk about it.

1397
00:56:10,701 --> 00:56:13,070
So this is supposed to
be a cozy family dinner,

1398
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:14,439
is that what this is?

1399
00:56:14,539 --> 00:56:16,006
Christ. you
don't make this easy!

1400
00:56:16,106 --> 00:56:17,575
You think
this is easy for me?

1401
00:56:17,675 --> 00:56:19,544
I don't know
what it is for you!

1402
00:56:19,644 --> 00:56:20,578
Don't yell at me!

1403
00:56:20,678 --> 00:56:21,712
I'm not yelling
at you.

1404
00:56:21,812 --> 00:56:22,713
I'm getting out
of here.

1405
00:56:22,813 --> 00:56:24,615
Sit down! You're
not going anywhere.

1406
00:56:24,715 --> 00:56:27,151
I have my own life, too.

1407
00:56:27,251 --> 00:56:28,953
Sometimes it's not easy
giving that up!

1408
00:56:29,053 --> 00:56:30,955
Really?

1409
00:56:31,055 --> 00:56:32,289
No one ever thinks
about what I need!

1410
00:56:32,457 --> 00:56:33,691
Maybe I miss
my friends from school.

1411
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:35,926
Maybe I want to go to
the movies or a party.

1412
00:56:36,026 --> 00:56:39,997
But no. I have to
be stuck here with you!

1413
00:56:40,097 --> 00:56:42,132
You little shit.

1414
00:56:44,068 --> 00:56:45,603
Go.

1415
00:56:45,703 --> 00:56:47,037
If you want to go, go.

1416
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:49,574
You don't want to live
here, don't, all right?

1417
00:56:49,674 --> 00:56:51,075
Why don't
you go to Meg's

1418
00:56:51,175 --> 00:56:54,679
and just have fun
with Meg, o.K.? Go!

1419
00:57:01,852 --> 00:57:03,087
[Door closes]

1420
00:57:04,689 --> 00:57:05,856
Shit!

1421
00:57:09,193 --> 00:57:10,795
Well, this is
a little embarrassing.

1422
00:57:10,895 --> 00:57:12,196
I didn't realize you'd
be here with someone.

1423
00:57:12,497 --> 00:57:13,397
We should go.

1424
00:57:13,498 --> 00:57:15,800
No, no.
Don't be silly.

1425
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:17,768
Does Jonathan like
grilled ahi

1426
00:57:17,868 --> 00:57:19,770
with cilantro
and lime sauce?

1427
00:57:19,870 --> 00:57:21,506
It's his favorite.

1428
00:57:23,741 --> 00:57:24,975
This smells great.

1429
00:57:25,075 --> 00:57:26,811
Good. excuse me.

1430
00:57:26,911 --> 00:57:29,246
All right, Dave.
What's going on?

1431
00:57:29,514 --> 00:57:30,781
What do you mean?

1432
00:57:30,881 --> 00:57:32,517
What do you think
i mean?

1433
00:57:32,550 --> 00:57:34,685
What?
you mean Heidi?

1434
00:57:34,785 --> 00:57:36,420
Yes, I mean Heidi.

1435
00:57:36,521 --> 00:57:38,756
What was i
supposed to do,

1436
00:57:38,856 --> 00:57:39,824
stop her
at the door?

1437
00:57:39,924 --> 00:57:40,891
There's an idea.

1438
00:57:40,991 --> 00:57:42,192
Well, I can't do that.

1439
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:44,128
We're soccer parents
together.

1440
00:57:44,228 --> 00:57:46,163
You know,
the same team.

1441
00:57:46,263 --> 00:57:47,698
There's a bond there.
We're panthers.

1442
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:49,266
Uh-huh.

1443
00:57:49,534 --> 00:57:50,535
Ohh...

1444
00:57:50,635 --> 00:57:52,703
Look. everything's
going to be fine.

1445
00:57:52,803 --> 00:57:55,372
They won't
stay long, really.

1446
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:57,374
I wanted this to be
a special night.

1447
00:57:57,608 --> 00:57:59,677
And it will be.

1448
00:57:59,777 --> 00:58:03,013
I promise, o.K.?

1449
00:58:03,113 --> 00:58:04,649
Come on.

1450
00:58:04,749 --> 00:58:07,151
[Doorbell rings]

1451
00:58:09,554 --> 00:58:10,555
I'll get that.

1452
00:58:11,556 --> 00:58:12,690
Coming!

1453
00:58:15,159 --> 00:58:16,326
Hi.

1454
00:58:16,561 --> 00:58:18,829
Hi, Sheila.

1455
00:58:18,929 --> 00:58:20,264
We were
in the neighborhood,

1456
00:58:20,364 --> 00:58:21,632
and we thought
we'd take a chance.

1457
00:58:21,732 --> 00:58:23,033
Uh...

1458
00:58:23,133 --> 00:58:25,035
Oh. oh, no.

1459
00:58:25,135 --> 00:58:27,872
This is
a bad time.

1460
00:58:27,972 --> 00:58:29,039
I should
have called.

1461
00:58:29,139 --> 00:58:30,841
No, no.
It's fine.

1462
00:58:30,941 --> 00:58:32,142
It's been so long
since I called a man,

1463
00:58:32,242 --> 00:58:33,811
I didn't know how.
I got nervous.

1464
00:58:33,911 --> 00:58:36,246
When I get nervous,
i bake.

1465
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:38,683
Oh. thank you,
Sheila.

1466
00:58:38,783 --> 00:58:40,685
She bakes.

1467
00:58:40,785 --> 00:58:42,687
So when you said
drop by,

1468
00:58:42,787 --> 00:58:44,889
you were
just being nice.

1469
00:58:44,989 --> 00:58:46,123
[Ben]
hey, Joshua. Think fast!

1470
00:58:46,223 --> 00:58:47,424
Oh!

1471
00:58:47,592 --> 00:58:49,727
Hey! come on!
Let's go!

1472
00:58:49,827 --> 00:58:52,597
Yeah! let's go!

1473
00:58:54,932 --> 00:58:57,602
Maybe we
could scrimmage.

1474
00:59:05,810 --> 00:59:07,612
So...

1475
00:59:11,215 --> 00:59:14,084
What do you weigh?

1476
00:59:14,184 --> 00:59:15,986
Come again.

1477
00:59:16,086 --> 00:59:18,856
Sorry. see, I'm
a wrestling coach.

1478
00:59:18,956 --> 00:59:21,125
The first thing I do
is try to put people

1479
00:59:21,225 --> 00:59:22,226
in their
proper weight class.

1480
00:59:22,326 --> 00:59:24,228
That's charming.

1481
00:59:25,830 --> 00:59:28,198
Uh...

1482
00:59:28,298 --> 00:59:30,200
Hmm...

1483
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:32,202
So you'd
wrestle what?

1484
00:59:32,302 --> 00:59:34,338
Um...126?

1485
00:59:34,639 --> 00:59:36,240
109!

1486
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:37,842
So you're
a featherweight.

1487
00:59:37,942 --> 00:59:40,778
Hmm. yeah.

1488
00:59:40,878 --> 00:59:43,213
Are we ready?

1489
00:59:43,313 --> 00:59:45,215
Ooh.
what do I want?

1490
00:59:45,315 --> 00:59:46,717
What do I want?

1491
00:59:46,817 --> 00:59:48,118
What do I want?

1492
00:59:48,218 --> 00:59:49,687
What do I want?

1493
00:59:49,787 --> 00:59:51,255

1495
00:59:54,725 --> 00:59:56,093
Let's see.

1496
00:59:56,193 --> 00:59:59,997
Chicken.
no, no, no.

1497
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:01,531
Do I want
a meatball sandwich?

1498
01:00:01,666 --> 01:00:02,700
I don't want
a meatball sandwich.

1499
01:00:08,172 --> 01:00:10,007
Is this it?

1500
01:00:10,107 --> 01:00:12,009
That's it.
This is it.

1501
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:13,077
This is it.

1502
01:00:14,144 --> 01:00:15,212
Veal?

1503
01:00:15,312 --> 01:00:17,047
Man, do you know

1504
01:00:17,147 --> 01:00:18,749
how long veal stays
in your colon?

1505
01:00:18,849 --> 01:00:20,250
It's, like, endless.

1506
01:00:22,352 --> 01:00:23,620
[Coughs]

1507
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:32,262
Oof!

1508
01:00:32,362 --> 01:00:33,664
I'm part Italian.

1509
01:00:33,764 --> 01:00:35,432
I could order for both
of us, if you like.

1510
01:00:35,666 --> 01:00:37,301
No!

1511
01:00:37,401 --> 01:00:39,169
Don't do that, o.K.?

1512
01:00:39,269 --> 01:00:40,170
Don't put me in the role

1513
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:41,171
of traditional
passive female,

1514
01:00:41,271 --> 01:00:42,172
and I'll just sit here

1515

with my little hands
in my little lap

1516
01:00:43,774 --> 01:00:46,143
while my big, strong man
orders for me, o.K.?

1517
01:00:46,243 --> 01:00:47,678
Let us not
play that game.

1518
01:00:51,248 --> 01:00:53,650
We're definitely going
to need another minute.

1519
01:01:03,293 --> 01:01:04,561
Would you
please tell me

1520
01:01:04,729 --> 01:01:05,495
what
we're doing here?

1521
01:01:05,730 --> 01:01:07,164
We're having fun!

1522
01:01:07,264 --> 01:01:08,598
You should call
your dad.

1523
01:01:08,733 --> 01:01:10,901
You should
just kick it!

1524
01:01:11,001 --> 01:01:12,236
I'm supposed
to be babysitting.

1525
01:01:12,336 --> 01:01:15,139
You are babysitting!

1526
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:21,411
Do you have
any rafi?

1527
01:01:21,746 --> 01:01:22,479
What?

1528
01:01:22,747 --> 01:01:24,214
Do you have
any rafi?

1529
01:01:24,314 --> 01:01:25,282
Reefer?

1530
01:01:25,382 --> 01:01:27,217
Rafi!

1531
01:01:31,155 --> 01:01:33,858
Oh, my god.
There he is.

1532
01:01:36,126 --> 01:01:38,295
I am totally in love.

1533
01:01:41,999 --> 01:01:44,769
Watch. I'm going
to talk to him.

1534

You came.
This is Walter.

1538
01:01:52,777 --> 01:01:54,511
Nice to see you again.

1539
01:01:54,779 --> 01:01:55,946
Hi.

1540
01:01:56,046 --> 01:01:57,848
Hello.

1541
01:01:57,948 --> 01:01:59,516
You want to dance?

1542
01:01:59,784 --> 01:02:00,851
Me?

1543
01:02:00,951 --> 01:02:01,852
Sure.

1544
01:02:01,952 --> 01:02:02,920
You want to dance
with me?

1545
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:04,488
You don't dance?

1546
01:02:04,789 --> 01:02:05,589
Yeah, but--

1547
01:02:05,790 --> 01:02:08,793
then let's dance.

1548
01:02:39,189 --> 01:02:41,158
Look, you want
to just go home

1549
01:02:41,258 --> 01:02:42,392
and forget this?

1550
01:02:42,492 --> 01:02:44,128
Make believe
it never happened?

1551
01:02:44,228 --> 01:02:46,931
No! come on, silly!

1552
01:02:47,031 --> 01:02:48,132
We're out.
We're dressed.

1553
01:02:48,232 --> 01:02:50,234
It's Saturday night!
Let's have a good time.

1554
01:02:50,334 --> 01:02:52,937
Whooeeow! whoow!

1555
01:02:53,037 --> 01:02:54,471
Whoo!

1556
01:02:54,571 --> 01:02:56,974
Are you on medication
or something?

1557
01:02:57,074 --> 01:02:58,442
God, everybody
asks me that.

1558
01:02:58,542 --> 01:03:00,544
No! I'm just
high on life!

1559
01:03:00,845 --> 01:03:03,914
Oh. is that it?

1560
01:03:04,014 --> 01:03:05,850
You don't date much,
do you?

1561
01:03:07,384 --> 01:03:09,987
In the last few years,
no.

1562
01:03:10,087 --> 01:03:11,922
You?

1563
01:03:12,022 --> 01:03:12,923
Mm-hmm. all the time,

1564
01:03:13,023 --> 01:03:14,191
and I'm getting
much better at it.

1565
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:16,226
I used to be
so much worse.

1566
01:03:16,326 --> 01:03:17,995
That's hard to believe.

1567
01:03:18,095 --> 01:03:19,263
How come
you don't date?

1568
01:03:19,363 --> 01:03:22,967
Ahh...you know.

1569
01:03:23,067 --> 01:03:25,535
You don't like
to talk, do you?

1570
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:28,172
It's hard for you to express
yourself. I know.

1571
01:03:28,272 --> 01:03:31,308
You can tell you keep
it all bottled up inside,

1572
01:03:31,408 --> 01:03:33,978
festering,
ready to explode.

1573
01:03:34,078 --> 01:03:35,712
I guess.

1574
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:36,713
Me, I can't shut up.

1575
01:03:36,881 --> 01:03:38,448
Want to know
why I got divorced?

1576
01:03:38,548 --> 01:03:39,884
Irreconcilable
differences.

1577
01:03:39,984 --> 01:03:41,185
We were
total opposites.

1578
01:03:41,285 --> 01:03:42,887
He was normal?

1579
01:03:42,953 --> 01:03:43,888
I kept telling him
i was going to leave.

1580
01:03:43,988 --> 01:03:44,955
He didn't believe me.

1581
01:03:45,055 --> 01:03:47,892
He said I was faking,
like with the orgasms.

1582
01:03:47,992 --> 01:03:48,959
Ahh...

1583
01:03:49,059 --> 01:03:50,094
He was one of those
unenlightened males

1584
01:03:50,194 --> 01:03:51,795
who would have rather
married his mother,

1585
01:03:51,896 --> 01:03:53,097
and that's not fair to me.

1586
01:03:53,197 --> 01:03:54,731
Finally, one day,
I'd had enough.

1587
01:03:54,899 --> 01:03:55,765
I left him a note.
It said,

1588
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:57,968
"michael, free-range
chicken in the fridge.

1589
01:03:58,068 --> 01:04:00,604
Underwear's in the dryer.
I'm out of here. Lucille."

1590
01:04:00,704 --> 01:04:02,940
That was very thoughtful
of you, Lucille,

1591
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:05,009
to leave the chicken.

1592
01:04:05,109 --> 01:04:07,111
That's how I am.

1593
01:04:07,211 --> 01:04:10,080
That's my crime.
Very giving.

1594
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:12,382
Lock me up.

1595
01:04:12,482 --> 01:04:13,783
Mm-hmm.

1596
01:04:13,918 --> 01:04:16,753
Let's see...
What looks good?

1597
01:04:16,921 --> 01:04:23,360
* I bless
the day I found you *

1598
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:28,933
* I want
to stay around you *

1599
01:04:29,033 --> 01:04:33,637
* and so I beg you

1600
01:04:34,538 --> 01:04:40,144
* let it be me

1601
01:04:40,244 --> 01:04:45,849
* don't take
this heaven from one *

1602
01:04:45,950 --> 01:04:51,321
* if you must cling to
someone *

1603
01:04:51,421 --> 01:04:55,025
* now and forever

1604
01:04:56,560 --> 01:05:00,164

1608

* what would life be?

1609
01:05:22,186 --> 01:05:24,621
No one saw you there,
did they?

1610
01:05:24,721 --> 01:05:26,090
I mean, Claire
didn't see you.

1611
01:05:26,190 --> 01:05:27,224
God, I hope not.

1612
01:05:27,324 --> 01:05:28,993
What were you
doing there, anyway?

1613
01:05:29,093 --> 01:05:30,227
I don't know.

1614
01:05:30,327 --> 01:05:32,629
I just wanted to see
what I don't have.

1615
01:05:32,729 --> 01:05:34,598
I mean, I'm standing
on that lawn,

1616
01:05:34,698 --> 01:05:36,266
and I don't live there.

1617
01:05:36,366 --> 01:05:39,269
I don't live with Claire.
How is that possible?

1618
01:05:39,369 --> 01:05:41,305
We used to be
Donny and Claire. Remember?

1619
01:05:41,405 --> 01:05:43,007
Sure, I remember.

1620
01:05:43,073 --> 01:05:45,542
You're talking to Susan,
of Susan and Dave.

1621
01:05:45,642 --> 01:05:46,910
We were a family.

1622
01:05:47,011 --> 01:05:48,612
I don't know
what we are now.

1623
01:05:48,712 --> 01:05:50,047
It could be a lot worse.

1624
01:05:50,147 --> 01:05:52,016
You read about it in
the papers all the time.

1625
01:05:52,082 --> 01:05:55,052
One parent kidnaps
the kids from another,

1626
01:05:55,152 --> 01:05:57,054
takes them
across state lines.

1627
01:05:57,154 --> 01:05:59,056
Can you imagine if you
couldn't even see Emma?

1628
01:05:59,156 --> 01:06:00,624
I mean, I know
it's not easy,

1629
01:06:00,724 --> 01:06:02,859
but we're much,
much better off

1630
01:06:03,027 --> 01:06:03,760
than a lot
of people, Donny.

1631
01:06:04,028 --> 01:06:05,429
Why are you so sunny?

1632
01:06:05,529 --> 01:06:06,696
What choice do I have?

1633
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:09,033
You could wallow in this
with me.

1634
01:06:09,099 --> 01:06:10,267
Come on!

1635
01:06:10,367 --> 01:06:11,268
Let's wallow!

1636
01:06:11,368 --> 01:06:12,636
Let's say bad things
about Phil

1637
01:06:12,736 --> 01:06:14,371
and our ex-spouses.

1638
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:15,405
It'll be fun.

1639
01:06:15,505 --> 01:06:17,507
I'm past that, Donny.

1640
01:06:17,607 --> 01:06:18,742
I'll tell you
something else.

1641
01:06:18,842 --> 01:06:21,245
I'm not going to
the graduation tomorrow.

1642
01:06:21,345 --> 01:06:23,947
Can't take it.
Oh, that's very mature.

1643
01:06:24,048 --> 01:06:25,882
Phil's going to be there.
Let's let Phil handle that.

1644
01:06:26,050 --> 01:06:28,618
It's not the same.
You're the father.

1645
01:06:28,718 --> 01:06:31,055
Birth father.
I'm the birth father.

1646
01:06:31,155 --> 01:06:32,622
I'm only operational
for weekends

1647
01:06:32,722 --> 01:06:34,058
and informal events.

1648
01:06:34,158 --> 01:06:36,060
I clean up nice,
but no real power,

1649
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:37,661
sort of like
prince Charles.

1650
01:06:37,761 --> 01:06:38,728
Let's face it.

1651
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:40,630
Nobody
wants me there anyway.

1652
01:06:40,730 --> 01:06:42,166
Emma wants you there.

1653
01:06:42,266 --> 01:06:43,400
It's very easy
for you to say.

1654
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:44,534
No!

1655
01:06:44,634 --> 01:06:47,071
It's not easy for me.

1656
01:06:47,137 --> 01:06:49,173
It's not easy
for any of us,

1657
01:06:49,273 --> 01:06:52,076
but this is how it is.

1658
01:06:52,142 --> 01:06:55,212
This is how
it turned out.

1659
01:06:55,312 --> 01:06:58,182
You're Emma's father,
and that's forever.

1660
01:06:58,282 --> 01:07:00,084
Nothing can change that.

1661
01:07:00,150 --> 01:07:03,253
You're going to be there
for her, Donny.

1662
01:07:03,353 --> 01:07:04,788
You are.

1663

1664

* no, you'll
just have to wait *

1668
01:07:29,479 --> 01:07:31,215
what was that?

1669
01:07:31,315 --> 01:07:32,216
I don't know,

1670
01:07:32,316 --> 01:07:34,218
but I did like it.

1671
01:07:34,318 --> 01:07:36,320
Yeah. me, too.

1672
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:39,356
* no, you'll
just have to wait *

oh, my god!
This feels good!

1675
01:07:44,461 --> 01:07:47,231
Oh, gee.
I'm kissing Dave's wife.

1676
01:07:47,331 --> 01:07:48,398
No, you're not.

1677
01:07:48,498 --> 01:07:50,134
No, I'm not.

1678
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:51,768
* I've grown impatient
for a love *

1679
01:07:51,868 --> 01:07:53,470
why didn't we
do this before?

1680
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:54,938
We were married before.

1681
01:07:55,172 --> 01:07:55,972
Oh, yeah.

1682
01:07:56,173 --> 01:07:59,209
* I can't go on *

1683
01:07:59,309 --> 01:08:00,877
you know that I almost
kissed you last Christmas?

1684
01:08:01,145 --> 01:08:02,579
Really?

1685
01:08:02,679 --> 01:08:04,548
You were standing
by the fruitcake,

1686
01:08:04,648 --> 01:08:05,815
and you looked so good.

1687
01:08:05,915 --> 01:08:07,217
You were in
that green suit.

1688
01:08:07,317 --> 01:08:08,552
You remember
what I was wearing?

1689
01:08:08,652 --> 01:08:10,187
Yeah. wow.
I guess I do.

1690
01:08:10,287 --> 01:08:12,322
Remember
what I was wearing?

1691
01:08:12,422 --> 01:08:15,159
I have no idea.

1692
01:08:15,192 --> 01:08:18,228
I'm not shooting for
a successful relationship

1693
01:08:18,328 --> 01:08:19,263
at this point.

1694
01:08:19,363 --> 01:08:20,330
I'm just looking
for something

1695
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:21,331
that will prevent me

1696
01:08:21,431 --> 01:08:23,733
from throwing myself
in front of a bus.

1697
01:08:23,833 --> 01:08:27,404
I'm keeping my expectations
very, very low.

1698
01:08:27,504 --> 01:08:29,506
Basically, I'm just
looking for a mammal.

1699
01:08:29,606 --> 01:08:30,640
That's my bottom line,

1700
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:33,643
and I'm really very
flexible on that, too.

1701
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:38,182

Why don't we move
in the living room

Oh, wonderful.

1729
01:10:04,801 --> 01:10:06,503
So anyway, I really
thought Jonathan

1730
01:10:06,603 --> 01:10:07,904
was going to make
the all-star team,

1731
01:10:08,004 --> 01:10:09,839

Who can get along
with Rudy?

1734
01:10:12,476 --> 01:10:14,644
Why do they
let him coach?

1735
01:10:14,744 --> 01:10:15,845
He's from Ecuador,

1736
01:10:15,945 --> 01:10:18,147
so they figure he must know
something about soccer.

1737
01:10:18,248 --> 01:10:19,983
Oh, that man.
He's so annoying.

1738
01:10:20,083 --> 01:10:22,018
He doesn't listen to
any of the mothers.

1739
01:10:22,218 --> 01:10:23,119
Is it just me?

1740
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:24,321
No. I've
noticed that, too.

1741
01:10:24,421 --> 01:10:25,689
I didn't want
to say anything.

1742
01:10:25,789 --> 01:10:26,790
Because you're
one of the few men

1743
01:10:26,890 --> 01:10:29,359
who actually does
listen to women.

more women coaches.

isn't going to work,

Not so fast.

Really? because it seemed
like it was working.

No. I'm afraid you'd be
thinking about Claire,

1762
01:11:24,981 --> 01:11:25,949
and you'd be afraid

1763
01:11:26,049 --> 01:11:27,717
that I was thinking
about Dave.

thought about Claire

about Dave?

you might change your mind.

been excluding you.

Oh.

1958
01:20:23,352 --> 01:20:25,688
There's no plan.
There's never a plan.

1959

There's just...

1960
01:20:27,823 --> 01:20:30,994
I don't know.
I was having fun.

1961
01:20:31,094 --> 01:20:32,996
I have been looking
so hard

1962
01:20:33,096 --> 01:20:34,697
for a way to get
into your life,

1963
01:20:34,898 --> 01:20:35,999
but you know what?

1964
01:20:36,099 --> 01:20:37,934
I don't want in
anymore.

1965
01:20:38,034 --> 01:20:39,735
I just want out.

[Doorbell ringing]

1967
01:20:40,970 --> 01:20:42,671
Oh, Jesus!

1968
01:20:42,872 --> 01:20:43,639
Don't go yet.

1969
01:20:43,873 --> 01:20:45,408
Please.

1970
01:20:51,214 --> 01:20:52,681
Vic.

1971
01:20:52,882 --> 01:20:54,650
Can we come in?

1972
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:57,253
Sure. come on in.

1973
01:21:06,996 --> 01:21:08,932
Dave, this is Lucille.
Lucille, Dave.

1974
01:21:09,032 --> 01:21:10,633
Hello, Lucille.

1975
01:21:10,934 --> 01:21:11,968
Hi, Dave.

1976
01:21:12,068 --> 01:21:13,769
Lucille's my, uh, date.

1977
01:21:13,937 --> 01:21:15,671
Your date? Oh!
Excuse me?

1978
01:21:15,939 --> 01:21:16,772
You don't own me.

1979
01:21:16,940 --> 01:21:18,207
We're in this
together.

1980
01:21:18,307 --> 01:21:19,642
It's our date.

1981
01:21:19,943 --> 01:21:21,277
Gotcha.

1982
01:21:23,312 --> 01:21:25,148
Did you guys have
a nice dinner?

1983
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:26,615
Not really.

1984
01:21:26,715 --> 01:21:28,784
No. we didn't
hit it off.

1985
01:21:28,952 --> 01:21:30,253
I'm sorry to hear that.

1986
01:21:30,353 --> 01:21:31,587
Mmm.

1987
01:21:31,687 --> 01:21:33,189
You want
to sit down?

1988
01:21:33,289 --> 01:21:34,657
No, thank you.

This is Lucille.

Hi, Lucille.
I'm Kim.

1993
01:21:42,966 --> 01:21:44,000
Of course you are.

Oh, bravo, Victor.
Very nice.

1995
01:21:46,702 --> 01:21:47,971
Thanks
for showing me

up against here.

she's petite,
she's perky,

and I'm a big fat pig,
right, Vic?

2001
01:21:57,613 --> 01:21:58,647
Oh, boy.

2002
01:21:58,747 --> 01:22:00,683

some drinks.

[Doorbell rings]

2004
01:22:03,386 --> 01:22:04,820
I almost slept with
your wife tonight.

2005

I thought you should know.

2006
01:22:05,989 --> 01:22:07,723
O.k. anything else?

No. that's it.

All right.
I'll see you later.

What do you mean,
see you?

Donny, this isn't
the best time.

2011
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:17,900
I didn't just borrow
a lawn mower here.

2012
01:22:18,001 --> 01:22:20,503
This is a human being
we're talking about.

2013
01:22:20,603 --> 01:22:23,639
She's a beautiful,
sensitive, caring woman,

2014

and she's--
she's beautiful.

2015

I know all about Susan.

2016

We were married
for nine years.

2017

You were never married.

2018
01:22:31,014 --> 01:22:32,481
You have no idea
what that means.

2019
01:22:32,581 --> 01:22:33,716
Is this a lecture?

2020
01:22:33,816 --> 01:22:35,651
Because I didn't
sign up for the class.

2021
01:22:35,751 --> 01:22:36,919
It was my fault,

2022
01:22:37,020 --> 01:22:40,023
because we covered for you,
and we lied for you,

2023
01:22:40,123 --> 01:22:42,558
and it was all wrong.

2024
01:22:42,658 --> 01:22:45,594
I owe you an apology.
I apologize.

2025
01:22:45,694 --> 01:22:47,796

the hell out.

gone to that party.

will be together.

do that?

01:27:57,406 --> 01:27:59,475
Could you sing it?

2135
01:28:07,450 --> 01:28:08,984
O.k.

2136
01:28:09,084 --> 01:28:12,821
We don't have to fix this
all tonight, you know?

2137
01:28:12,921 --> 01:28:14,823
It's a good start.

2138
01:28:17,059 --> 01:28:19,428
[Rock music playing loudly]

2139
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:27,903
Hey! don't be
so concerned
about Emma, o.K.?

2140
01:28:28,003 --> 01:28:29,605
She's going to be fine.

2141
01:28:29,705 --> 01:28:32,808
Dad, you can't believe
how cool this car is!

2142
01:28:32,908 --> 01:28:34,443
Turn it down!

2143
01:28:35,911 --> 01:28:38,814
Dad, you can't believe
how cool this car is!

2144
01:28:38,914 --> 01:28:42,217
How many points
do I need to get one?

2145
01:28:42,385 --> 01:28:43,452
Jed, you
could sit in a bath

2146
01:28:43,552 --> 01:28:46,522
eating vegetables, doing
your homework all day

2147
01:28:46,622 --> 01:28:48,591
for the rest
of your life,

2148
01:28:48,691 --> 01:28:50,426
and you
would not come close

2149
01:28:50,526 --> 01:28:51,660
to getting one of these.

2150
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:55,398
But it's got surround-sound
and autoscan. Listen.

2151
01:28:55,431 --> 01:28:57,766
[Townsend]
what is wrong with you people?

2152
01:28:57,866 --> 01:28:59,702
It's so simple!

2153
01:28:59,802 --> 01:29:01,604
Get out of the car.

2154
01:29:01,704 --> 01:29:03,038
What?

2155
01:29:03,138 --> 01:29:04,440
I need it. Meg!

2156
01:29:04,540 --> 01:29:05,974
Yeah, dad?

2157
01:29:06,074 --> 01:29:08,010
I've got errands.
I'll meet you back home.

2158
01:29:08,110 --> 01:29:09,445
Errands?

2159
01:29:09,545 --> 01:29:13,015
Keep an eye on your brother.
You're still babysitting.

2160
01:29:13,115 --> 01:29:15,951
By the way, you're not
getting paid for tonight!

2161
01:29:16,051 --> 01:29:19,121
[Peter gunn playing]

2162
01:29:46,515 --> 01:29:48,083
Excuse me.
Can I help you?

2163
01:29:50,453 --> 01:29:51,720
And you are?

2164
01:29:53,656 --> 01:29:54,957
Uh...

2165
01:29:55,057 --> 01:29:56,559
Uh, what
do you want?

2166
01:29:56,659 --> 01:29:59,094
Uh, you like
a souvenir mug?

2167
01:29:59,194 --> 01:30:01,464
What gives you
the right?

2168
01:30:01,497 --> 01:30:04,467
You make it all sound
so easy, don't you?

2169
01:30:04,567 --> 01:30:08,303
What gives
me the right?

2170
01:30:08,403 --> 01:30:12,007
You're in here with
your stupid, stupid voice!

2171
01:30:12,107 --> 01:30:13,476
Brian! Brian!
Brian!

2172
01:30:13,576 --> 01:30:15,578
This is for everybody!

2173
01:30:15,678 --> 01:30:18,113
I just want to
tear your throat out!

2174
01:30:18,213 --> 01:30:20,182
[Falsetto]
o.k. all right. O.K.

2175
01:30:20,282 --> 01:30:23,318
And now back
to Dr. David townsend.

2176
01:30:23,418 --> 01:30:26,088
We're back,
and we've got a guest.

2177
01:30:26,188 --> 01:30:28,156
O.k.!

2178
01:30:28,256 --> 01:30:29,958
Can you get
the Dodgers score?

2179
01:30:30,058 --> 01:30:31,460
I can try.

2180
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:33,061
Brian!

2181
01:30:33,161 --> 01:30:35,998
You just invent your
crappy dime-store wisdom!

2182
01:30:36,098 --> 01:30:37,299
That was my father.

2183
01:30:37,566 --> 01:30:38,601
Where?

2184
01:30:38,701 --> 01:30:40,368
No! on the radio
screaming!

2185
01:30:40,469 --> 01:30:43,338
...after hour,
after hour, after hour!

2186
01:30:43,438 --> 01:30:45,140
The crime
you commit, townsend,

2187
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:48,443
is you make people think
this divorce stuff is easy!

2188
01:30:48,544 --> 01:30:51,179
It's their fault if
they're not good at this!

2189
01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:52,981
You make me feel
something's wrong with me

2190
01:30:53,081 --> 01:30:55,350
because I'm not
enjoying my divorce!

2191
01:30:55,450 --> 01:30:56,919
Well, there's nothing
wrong with me!

2192
01:30:57,019 --> 01:30:59,287
It's you, townsend!
You're giving us a complex!

2193
01:30:59,522 --> 01:31:00,589
This is hard!

2194
01:31:00,689 --> 01:31:02,825
And you think
all we got to do

2195
01:31:02,925 --> 01:31:06,629
is listen to you
and this gets better.

2196
01:31:06,729 --> 01:31:07,830
Well, guess what, pal?

2197
01:31:07,930 --> 01:31:10,165
This never gets better!
It never ends!

2198
01:31:10,265 --> 01:31:12,234
It's never over! Never!

2199
01:31:12,535 --> 01:31:13,536
They o.K.?

2200
01:31:13,602 --> 01:31:14,837
Yeah, they're fine.

2201
01:31:14,937 --> 01:31:16,605
They're still listening
to their dad

2202
01:31:16,705 --> 01:31:19,542
yelling at that townsend
guy on the radio.

2203
01:31:19,642 --> 01:31:21,076
That's one angry guy.

2204
01:31:24,747 --> 01:31:27,249
You mind if we wait,

2205
01:31:27,349 --> 01:31:28,250
just till their father
comes home?

2206
01:31:28,551 --> 01:31:29,985
Sure.

2207
01:31:31,654 --> 01:31:34,389
Thanks for sticking
up for me tonight.

2208
01:31:34,557 --> 01:31:36,859
Hell, that man
was way out of line.

2209
01:31:36,959 --> 01:31:38,627
You know how fathers are.

2210
01:31:38,727 --> 01:31:42,230
No, I don't. Not really.

2211
01:31:42,330 --> 01:31:46,301
Where is
your father, Max?

2212
01:31:46,569 --> 01:31:48,270
I don't really have one.

2213
01:31:48,370 --> 01:31:51,173
There's a guy living
with my mother now,

2214
01:31:51,273 --> 01:31:52,307
but he's more
of a pain in the ass

2215
01:31:52,575 --> 01:31:53,976
than a father.

2216
01:31:58,581 --> 01:32:02,050
Max, I'm going to be
71 years old pretty soon.

2217
01:32:02,150 --> 01:32:04,486
I live in a big house
all by myself,

2218
01:32:04,587 --> 01:32:07,055
and I'm working on
the adopt-a-geezer program.

2219
01:32:08,891 --> 01:32:10,192
Now, I'm not begging you,

2220
01:32:10,292 --> 01:32:13,428
but I could sure as hell
use some company.

2221
01:32:13,596 --> 01:32:16,765
Walter, you don't
even know me, man.

2222
01:32:16,865 --> 01:32:19,735
Why would you want me
hanging around?

2223
01:32:19,835 --> 01:32:20,903
There's a catch.

2224
01:32:21,003 --> 01:32:22,004
What's that?

2225
01:32:22,104 --> 01:32:25,641
You've got to
drive me to work.

2226
01:32:29,011 --> 01:32:31,213
Townsend! no more talk.
You and me!

2227
01:32:31,313 --> 01:32:32,881
15 rounds, right here!

2228
01:32:32,981 --> 01:32:34,983
You are a very
passionate man,

2229
01:32:35,083 --> 01:32:36,819
and I respect that,
Mr...

2230
01:32:36,919 --> 01:32:39,187
Damico. Vic damico.

2231
01:32:39,287 --> 01:32:40,723
D-a-m-i-c-o.

2232
01:32:40,823 --> 01:32:42,725
You're going through
a rough one,

2233
01:32:42,825 --> 01:32:43,926
are you, Vic?

2234
01:32:44,026 --> 01:32:44,927
Just shut up!

2235
01:32:45,027 --> 01:32:46,829
For once, listen
to somebody else!

2236
01:32:46,929 --> 01:32:48,530
See? this is good.
This is good

2237
01:32:48,631 --> 01:32:50,866
because y-y-y-you're
just opening up,

2238
01:32:50,966 --> 01:32:53,201
a-a-and good things
can come from this.

2239
01:32:53,301 --> 01:32:56,138
I am guessing that
you have children, Vic.

2240
01:32:56,238 --> 01:32:59,708
Don't, o.K.?
Don't try to draw me out.

2241
01:32:59,808 --> 01:33:01,109
It won't work.

2242
01:33:04,112 --> 01:33:05,681
Three.

2243
01:33:05,781 --> 01:33:08,016
And, uh, since
the divorce,

2244
01:33:08,116 --> 01:33:10,819
you're feeling
distant, removed?

2245
01:33:10,919 --> 01:33:13,889
Wrong as usual,
Dr. know-it-all.

2246
01:33:13,989 --> 01:33:14,957
This is good.
Don't block.

2247
01:33:15,057 --> 01:33:17,860
Zip it, or I'll
break you in half.

2248
01:33:17,960 --> 01:33:18,861
All right.

2249
01:33:18,961 --> 01:33:21,229
You see,
before the divorce,

2250
01:33:21,329 --> 01:33:23,098
I thought I was
close to my kids,

2251
01:33:23,198 --> 01:33:24,900
but I really wasn't.

2252
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,269
I mean, I loved them,
i took care of them,

2253
01:33:27,369 --> 01:33:30,405
made sure they had
a roof over their heads,

2254
01:33:30,673 --> 01:33:32,240
but I left it to grace--

2255
01:33:32,340 --> 01:33:33,275
grace?

2256
01:33:33,375 --> 01:33:34,910
Yeah. my ex.

2257
01:33:35,010 --> 01:33:37,512
To handle the real
emotional stuff.

2258
01:33:37,680 --> 01:33:39,915
You know,
the intimate stuff.

2259
01:33:40,015 --> 01:33:41,917
And she
was good at it.

2260
01:33:42,017 --> 01:33:43,285
I got to
give her credit.

2261
01:33:43,385 --> 01:33:45,553
She's still
good at it.

2262
01:33:45,688 --> 01:33:48,857
I was working, you know,
sometimes two jobs.

2263
01:33:48,957 --> 01:33:50,993
I just wasn't
around much.

2264
01:33:51,093 --> 01:33:53,161
I'm not making
excuses.

2265
01:33:53,261 --> 01:33:57,900
I should have been
there, but I wasn't.

2266
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,267
I'd come home.

2267
01:33:59,367 --> 01:34:02,805
Grace would tell me
which kid to hug,

2268
01:34:02,905 --> 01:34:04,139
which kid to yell at.

2269
01:34:04,239 --> 01:34:05,874
I'd read
their report cards,

2270
01:34:05,974 --> 01:34:07,810
I'd kiss them
good night,

2271
01:34:07,910 --> 01:34:11,046
and sometimes
I'd make breakfast,

2272
01:34:11,146 --> 01:34:12,815
and that was about it.

2273
01:34:12,915 --> 01:34:14,883
You know?

2274
01:34:14,983 --> 01:34:18,053
But now when
my kids are with me,

2275
01:34:18,153 --> 01:34:19,822
it's just me.

2276
01:34:19,922 --> 01:34:22,825
I'm the one who
puts the band-aids on.

2277
01:34:22,925 --> 01:34:25,227
I'm the one
who rubs the tummy,

2278
01:34:25,327 --> 01:34:26,829
shampoos the hair,

2279
01:34:26,929 --> 01:34:30,165
and holds them when
they have bad dreams.

2280
01:34:31,934 --> 01:34:35,237
Then they go back
to their mother...

2281
01:34:37,873 --> 01:34:40,108
And I realize
what I'm missing.

2282
01:34:40,208 --> 01:34:45,748
You know, before...
I didn't really know.

2283
01:34:47,049 --> 01:34:49,317
I couldn't put
my finger on it.

2284
01:34:51,319 --> 01:34:54,289
But...now I know.

2285
01:34:57,392 --> 01:34:59,327
Now I know.

2286
01:35:02,364 --> 01:35:05,133
I love that man.

2287
01:35:07,035 --> 01:35:08,103
I'm sorry.

2288
01:35:08,203 --> 01:35:09,471
[Townsend]
if you get a busy signal,

2289
01:35:09,772 --> 01:35:10,873
keep on trying.

2290
01:35:10,973 --> 01:35:12,274
The lines are tied up

2291
01:35:12,374 --> 01:35:14,777
because we're here
with Mr. Vic damico,

2292
01:35:14,877 --> 01:35:17,112
divorce survivor,
divorce victim,

2293
01:35:17,212 --> 01:35:18,180
divorce hero.

2294
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:21,316
John from Pasadena,
you're on the air.

2295
01:35:21,416 --> 01:35:22,617
Hi, Dr. townsend.

2296
01:35:22,785 --> 01:35:25,187
I listen to your show
all the time,

2297
01:35:25,287 --> 01:35:26,955
and I really,
really hate you--

2298
01:35:27,055 --> 01:35:29,624
oops! we seem
to have lost John.

2299
01:35:29,792 --> 01:35:31,794
Our next caller,
Wendy from silver lake.

2300
01:35:31,827 --> 01:35:33,628
Hi, Dr. townsend.
Hi, Vic.

2301
01:35:33,796 --> 01:35:35,030
Hi, Wendy.
Hi, Wendy.

2302
01:35:35,130 --> 01:35:36,431
Hold on
a second, Wendy.

2303
01:35:36,531 --> 01:35:38,266
Doc, a little
sugar, please.

2304
01:35:38,366 --> 01:35:39,802
I was just wondering,

2305
01:35:39,835 --> 01:35:42,237
Vic, do you want to
get married again?

2306
01:35:42,337 --> 01:35:45,007
If I found
the right girl

2307
01:35:45,107 --> 01:35:46,341
and my kids
liked her.

2308
01:35:46,441 --> 01:35:49,044
No, no. Do you want
to marry me?

2309
01:35:49,144 --> 01:35:51,279
Uh, Vic, we're
going to have to

2310
01:35:51,379 --> 01:35:53,181
take a little
break now.

2311
01:35:53,281 --> 01:35:54,349
Yeah. oh, o.K.

2312
01:35:54,449 --> 01:35:57,119
Uh, we'll be right
back after this.

2313
01:35:57,219 --> 01:35:58,186
[Music playing]

2314
01:35:58,286 --> 01:35:59,187
You're fabulous.

2315
01:35:59,287 --> 01:36:00,155
You haven't
done this before?

2316
01:36:00,255 --> 01:36:01,156
Never.

2317
01:36:01,256 --> 01:36:02,657
Fabulous.

2318
01:36:02,825 --> 01:36:05,660
This is great.
Good coffee, too.

2319
01:36:05,828 --> 01:36:08,696
Can you believe
that Vic on the radio?

2320
01:36:08,831 --> 01:36:09,697
Tell me
about it.

2321
01:36:09,898 --> 01:36:11,666
He's good, isn't he?

2322
01:36:11,834 --> 01:36:13,668
Call in myself with
a few questions.

2323
01:36:13,836 --> 01:36:14,970
Maybe he can
help me out.

2324
01:36:15,070 --> 01:36:17,439
I never heard him
talk so passionately

2325
01:36:17,539 --> 01:36:18,841
about his kids.

2326
01:36:18,907 --> 01:36:20,843
Never heard him
talk passionately

2327
01:36:20,909 --> 01:36:23,111
about anything,
except the Red Sox.

2328
01:36:26,081 --> 01:36:27,682
Donny,
what you said before

2329
01:36:27,883 --> 01:36:28,951
over at my house--

2330
01:36:29,051 --> 01:36:31,119
we don't have to
talk about that tonight.

2331
01:36:31,219 --> 01:36:34,056
I want to tell you
that you were right.

2332
01:36:34,156 --> 01:36:36,091
I want to work on that.

2333
01:36:36,191 --> 01:36:38,660
Commitment,
that's important.

2334
01:36:38,861 --> 01:36:40,395
Is that what I said?

2335
01:36:40,495 --> 01:36:42,130
I don't know anything.

2336
01:36:42,230 --> 01:36:44,532
That was just something
to say.

2337
01:36:44,632 --> 01:36:47,635
You were right
about Susan, too.

2338
01:36:47,870 --> 01:36:49,137
She's the greatest,

2339
01:36:49,237 --> 01:36:50,205
and you're
the greatest,

2340
01:36:50,305 --> 01:36:51,473
so if
that works out,

2341
01:36:51,573 --> 01:36:54,176
that would be
great.

2342
01:36:54,276 --> 01:36:56,211
Just great.

2343
01:36:56,311 --> 01:36:59,081
You o.K.?

2344
01:36:59,181 --> 01:37:00,115
Yeah.

2345
01:37:00,215 --> 01:37:02,217
I'm o.K.

2346
01:37:02,317 --> 01:37:05,187
I'm right where
i want to be.

2347
01:37:05,287 --> 01:37:07,890
We never talk
about that.

2348
01:37:07,956 --> 01:37:11,059
You know, if you're
happy or I'm happy.

2349
01:37:11,159 --> 01:37:13,095
We never talk
about that.

2350
01:37:13,195 --> 01:37:14,429
No, we don't.

2351
01:37:16,564 --> 01:37:18,100
You want to?

2352
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:19,667
No.

2353
01:37:19,902 --> 01:37:21,369
Me, neither.

2354
01:37:28,510 --> 01:37:30,178
See ya.

2355
01:37:30,278 --> 01:37:32,347
O.k.

2356
01:37:35,150 --> 01:37:37,519
When my father
left home...

2357
01:37:39,387 --> 01:37:40,755
I didn't see him

2358
01:37:40,923 --> 01:37:44,259
for maybe five
or six months.

2359
01:37:44,359 --> 01:37:47,195
One day, he, uh...
He pulled up

2360
01:37:47,295 --> 01:37:49,397
in this
brand-new mustang.

2361
01:37:49,497 --> 01:37:52,367
He'd grown these
sideburns, you know?

2362
01:37:53,501 --> 01:37:56,171
I was 11 years
old at the time,

2363
01:37:56,271 --> 01:37:57,405
and all I could
think was,

2364
01:37:57,505 --> 01:38:00,208
"who is this guy?"

2365
01:38:01,409 --> 01:38:04,212
He bought me
a tennis racket.

2366
01:38:07,215 --> 01:38:09,517
I didn't
play tennis.

2367
01:38:10,953 --> 01:38:13,221
I still don't
play tennis.

2368
01:38:15,190 --> 01:38:17,259
I don't want
to be him.

2369
01:38:22,364 --> 01:38:24,566
You're not him.

2370
01:38:26,534 --> 01:38:28,336
Every time
i pass a couple,

2371
01:38:28,436 --> 01:38:32,040
I think, how come they
can do it, and I can't?

2372
01:38:32,140 --> 01:38:33,075
How come they can
stay together?

2373
01:38:33,175 --> 01:38:36,078
What do they know
that I don't?

2374
01:38:36,178 --> 01:38:39,982
When my kids go back
on Sunday, I cry.

2375
01:38:41,516 --> 01:38:44,987
I worry that I'm
ruining their lives...

2376
01:38:46,421 --> 01:38:48,290
That I'm ruining mine.

2377
01:38:48,390 --> 01:38:51,459
I do the best
that I can.

2378
01:38:53,996 --> 01:38:55,463
But I'm screwed.

2379
01:38:57,165 --> 01:38:59,067
What if it's not enough?

2380
01:39:15,417 --> 01:39:16,551
[Vic]
there's going to be

2381
01:39:16,651 --> 01:39:18,520
good days
and bad days.

2382
01:39:18,620 --> 01:39:20,222
You're going
to make mistakes.

2383
01:39:20,322 --> 01:39:21,223
You're going
to screw up.

2384
01:39:21,323 --> 01:39:24,092
Hey, you're just a guy.

2385
01:39:24,192 --> 01:39:26,028
The main thing is
to love your kids

2386
01:39:26,128 --> 01:39:28,263
and keep going.

2387
01:39:28,363 --> 01:39:33,368
Just love 'em,
you know?

2388
01:39:35,270 --> 01:39:37,739
Just love 'em.

2389
01:39:51,253 --> 01:39:55,423
* who knows how long
I've loved you? *

2390
01:39:55,523 --> 01:39:59,727
* you know
i love you still *

2391
01:39:59,827 --> 01:40:04,499

2392
01:40:04,599 --> 01:40:08,736
* if you want me to,
i will *

2393
01:40:11,506 --> 01:40:15,477
* 'cause if i
ever saw you *

2394
01:40:15,577 --> 01:40:19,481
* I didn't catch your name

2395
01:40:19,581 --> 01:40:24,286
* but it doesn't
really matter *

2396
01:40:24,386 --> 01:40:29,291
* I will always feel the same

2397
01:40:29,391 --> 01:40:34,096
* I'll love you forever
and forever *

2398

2403
01:40:53,515 --> 01:40:57,419
* this song will fill
the air *

2404
01:40:57,519 --> 01:41:02,157
* sing it loud
so I can hear you *

2405
01:41:02,257 --> 01:41:06,494
* make it easy
to be near you *

2406
