No! Whoa!

treacherous current.</i>

ahead, I'll catch up.

I'm not going anywhere.

turned or something.

I don't really
know much about tides.

00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:35,812
But the point is, we need
to find another way out.

781
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:37,647
Okay. Good luck with that.

782
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:39,728
Okay, yeah,
I can get us out of here.

783
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:42,026
Time to turn on my
trailblazing skills.

784
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:44,987

had that weird dream...

...where a bunch of crabs
are crawling all over you?

786
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:49,692
No. You know, I've had
the lobster dream but...

if they're friendly! Ow!

791
00:42:56,866 --> 00:42:59,745
Hey, back off,
shoo, shoo, get out of here!

792
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:02,710
Oh, I see you like to dance. So,
what will it be, my briny friend?

messed with the wrong--

796

00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:17,433

Wiggly-wiggly-woo.

798

you on the food chain?

802
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:30,526
High, low, middle?
Give us a ballpark-- Run!

803
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,574

they don't want us!

do they want?!

805
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:37,406
The crabs!

806

Ew, they just eat them whole?

807
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:41,369
I guess they're purists.

808
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:44,210
Come on Juniper, follow me!
I'm pretty sure it's this way.

809
00:43:44,372 --> 00:43:46,716
Lead on, Patchi,
but can we slow it down

810
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:49,086
a tad?
Still a little tender here.

811
00:43:49,252 --> 00:43:51,380

already becoming a leader.</i>

you gotta start somewhere.</i>

the wintery Alaskan wilderness...</i>

a very longtime.</i>

It's getting kinda chilly.

821
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:25,872
We should have brought layers.

822
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,208
Are you sure this is the right
way to the feeding grounds?

823
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:31,761
Of course I'm sure. I got a knack
for these kinds of things.

824
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:35,924
Besides, I've also got a foolproof
Plan B and his name is Alex.

I hope there's a Plan C,
'cause I'm totally lost.

826
00:44:39,302 --> 00:44:42,772
Did you hear that? We're
lost in this horrible place.

827
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:47,811
It's just a normal forest
full of normal foresty things.

828
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:51,397
What was that?

(SCREAMS)

830
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:00,289
That's not funny!

831
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,788
Take it
somewhere else, furball!

832
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:07,330
You know, someday these
mammals will go extinct...

833
00:45:07,622 --> 00:45:10,341
...and then we'll have the last laugh.
Ha ha!

834
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:20,306
You know, it isn't
actually that bad out here.

835
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:22,015
Think about it:
a dark creepy forest

836
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:23,683
is really just an open field...

837
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:25,439

00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:46,857
But it is how
things are done.

1004
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:49,313
What? What kind of things?

1005
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:52,730
I cannot interfere with matters of
the heart, it is against my policy!

1006
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:54,318
Patchi loves you.

1007
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:55,573
Huh?

1008
00:53:56,567 --> 00:53:59,867
Patchi! I was afraid you
weren't going to show up.

1009
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:02,497
What? Of course I was.

1010
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:05,000
And, wait, what am I showing
up for again? (LAUGHS)

1011
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:07,036
The headbutting
contest, silly.

1012
00:54:07,161 --> 00:54:09,038
Major is taking
on all challengers.

1013
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:12,378
Who would be dumb enough to
challenge that guy? He's huge.

1014
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:13,751
(ROARING)

1015
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:15,381
JUNIPER: And it looks
like you're up.

1016
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:16,719
What?!

1017
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:24,140
I should sit this one out, 'cause I
just ate two huge berry bushes and--

1018
00:54:24,303 --> 00:54:26,351
Step aside, Patchi.

1019
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:30,768
(ROARS)

1020
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:39,243
Hey, Major, it's time you went head
to head with a real Pachyrhinosaur!

1021
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:49,244
I'll tell you what:
Scowler does not back down.

1022
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:51,880
What's the big deal?
I could do that!

1023
00:54:52,581 --> 00:54:54,925
I've got 50 bugs
on the big guy.

1024
00:55:05,052 --> 00:55:07,851
If you're just going to chit
chat, I'm going to get a snack.

1025
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:09,060
Hold my place.

1026
00:55:11,892 --> 00:55:15,442
ALEX: <i>Ah, yes, the clash of
the Pachyrhinosaurs.</i>

1027
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:19,734
<i>One of the great spectacles
of prehistoric pugilism.</i> ..

1028
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:22,323
<i>...combining
the grace of ballet</i>

1029
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:24,867
<i>with the stupidity of
banging into things.</i>

1030
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:28,288
<i>This was to be a very
momentous contest...</i>

1031
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:30,544
<i>...for it was on that day...</i>

1032
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:33,080
<i>...that Scowler not
only took on Major,</i>

1033
00:55:33,205 --> 00:55:35,583
<i>the big boss of
the Pachyrhinosaurs...</i>

1034
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:37,547
<i>...but he defeated him.</i>

1035
00:55:42,214 --> 00:55:45,263
<i>And just like that,
a new era was born.</i>

1036
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:46,810
(ROARING)

1037
00:55:47,553 --> 00:55:50,397
<i>Scowler was the new
leader of the herd.</i>

1038
00:55:53,267 --> 00:55:55,816
- Yeah!
- Way to go, Scowler! Nice.

1039
00:55:58,063 --> 00:56:01,067
Good fight, Major.
Too bad someone had to lose.

1040
00:56:01,275 --> 00:56:02,492
That was you, by the way.

1041
00:56:02,651 --> 00:56:04,449
PATCHI: Man, that was epic.

1042
00:56:04,945 --> 00:56:05,946
Great job, buddy.

1043
00:56:06,113 --> 00:56:08,787
I'm not your buddy, I'm the
leader of the herd now.

1044
00:56:08,949 --> 00:56:10,326
Show some respect.

1045
00:56:10,492 --> 00:56:11,835
- But-but--
- Patchi!

1046
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:13,624
How was I supposed to know?

1047
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:15,164
Juniper where are you going?

1048
00:56:15,247 --> 00:56:17,591
Sorry, Patchi,
it's those stupid rules.

1049
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:21,424
Law of the arctic, little bro.
You snooze, you lose.

1050
00:56:21,587 --> 00:56:23,339
But I didn't-- I mean...

1051
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:27,009
Hold on. How about a do-over?
Huh? Best of three?

1052
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:28,597
I'm ready now, let's do it!

1053
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,637
We're not kids anymore!

1054
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:33,478
Come on, Juniper. Move out!

1055
00:56:33,682 --> 00:56:35,650
Oh, and Patchi--

1056
00:56:36,268 --> 00:56:40,444
I know, I know,
eat your dust.

1057
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:56,505
ALEX: <i>And the herd marched on, but this
time with Scowler leading the way.</i>

1058
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:59,166
SCOWLER: Okay,
this is Scowler's herd...

1059
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:02,132
...and things are gonna be
different around here from now on!

1060
00:57:02,294 --> 00:57:04,342
Rule number one,
all herd members

1061
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:07,174
will walk a minimum
four feet behind Scowler!

1062
00:57:09,009 --> 00:57:13,856
Rule number two, do not speak to
Scowler without first being spoken to.

1063
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:19,191
Rule number three, do not make
direct eye contact with Scowler.

1064
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:22,235
Rule number four, never
question or contradict Scowler.

1065
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:24,365
The first Thursday
of every month

1066
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:26,526
will be known as
Scowler Appreciation Day.

1067
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:28,912
Suggested gifts include,
but are not limited to--

1068
00:57:29,071 --> 00:57:31,915
ALEX: <i>As if Patchi's bruised
ego wasn't bad enough...</i>

1069
00:57:32,074 --> 00:57:36,045
<i>...now he had a big old heap
of heartbreak to go with it.</i>

1070
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:41,045
Hey! Hey, get out,
you lousy squatter.

1071
00:57:41,208 --> 00:57:44,178
Cheer up, Patchi,
it's not the end of the world.

1072
00:57:44,336 --> 00:57:45,838
That won't come for
another couple years.

1073
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:47,347
PATCHI: Leave me alone,
would you?

1074
00:57:47,506 --> 00:57:49,554
ALEX: You wanna talk about it?
You wanna share?

1075
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:51,093
PATCHI: Get off!

1076
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:53,933
ALEX: Okay, you're the boss!
Besides Scowler.

1077
00:57:54,096 --> 00:57:56,064
Too soon? Too soon, sorry.

1078
00:57:57,516 --> 00:58:00,895
ALEX: <i>The ice and snow had started
to thaw, but Patchi's heart?</i>

1079
00:58:01,061 --> 00:58:04,110
<i>Well, that was another matter.</i>

1080
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:07,693
<i>Yep, these were tough times
for our lumbering hero.</i>

1081
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:12,372
<i>But as the saying goes, when life
gives you lemons, make lemonade.</i>

1082
00:58:12,531 --> 00:58:14,283
<i>And when life puts
your brother in charge</i>

1083
00:58:14,366 --> 00:58:16,744
<i>and takes away
the girl of your dreams...</i>

1084
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:19,170
<i>Well,
that's-that's a tough one.</i>

1085
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:20,834
<i>Let me get back
to you on that.</i>

1086
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:43,112
JUNIPER: Way to go, Scowler. Frozen
water, always fun to walk on.

1087
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:46,527
I wish Juniper
would look back at me,

1088
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:48,946
just give me
some sort of sign.

1089
00:58:49,735 --> 00:58:51,988
Hey, I don't remember
coming this way.

1090
00:58:52,821 --> 00:58:55,074
Must be one of
Scowler's shortcuts.

1091
00:58:56,408 --> 00:58:57,785
Hmm.

1092
00:59:04,458 --> 00:59:07,086
Come on, people,
try to keep up here.

1093
00:59:07,753 --> 00:59:10,302
Whoa! I heard laughing,
who's laughing?

1094
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:11,677
(ROARS)

1095
00:59:48,668 --> 00:59:49,669
(GROANS)

1096
00:59:49,753 --> 00:59:53,599
PATCHI: I can't believe we're on a
frozen lake in the middle of spring.

1097
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:54,674
(ICE CRACKING)

1098
00:59:56,218 --> 00:59:59,688
Wait a minute. We're on a frozen
lake in the middle of spring?

1099
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:01,018
Juniper!

1100
01:00:01,181 --> 01:00:02,774
Tell Scowler it's not safe!

1101
01:00:02,933 --> 01:00:05,732
JUNIPER: He won't listen to me.
He won't listen to anybody.

1102
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:07,612
(ROARS)

1103
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:15,613
Juniper, you have to believe me,
we need to get off this ice!

1104
01:00:15,779 --> 01:00:20,250
But Scowler's the herd leader.
We have to follow him, it's the rule.

1105
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:21,792
Oh, no!

1106
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,384
I told you guys to
pick up the pace!

1107
01:00:29,543 --> 01:00:31,921
Come on! No retreating!

1108
01:00:33,255 --> 01:00:34,598
ALEX: <i>While Scowler
blundered forward...</i>

1109
01:00:34,756 --> 01:00:37,635
<i>...Patchi knew he had to
move the herd off the ice.</i>

1110
01:00:37,801 --> 01:00:40,224
Everybody, back to shore!

1111
01:00:40,929 --> 01:00:42,772
Turn back, everyone.

1112
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:48,229
PATCHI: You guys, it's not safe!
We need to turn back!

1113
01:00:51,148 --> 01:00:54,743
Come on, little guy,
I got you. That's it.

1114
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:57,780
PATCHI: Let's go!
Everybody follow me!

1115
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:02,743
Everyone off the ice!

1116
01:01:04,411 --> 01:01:05,833
On to shore, everybody!

1117
01:01:06,246 --> 01:01:08,089
Just push in!

1118
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:16,598
JUNIPER: Patchi! What now?!
There's too many of us!

1119
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:19,218
Okay. Think! Um...

1120
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:22,934
Knock down the tree and feast
on the leafy greens up top.

1121
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:24,769
That's it! Follow me!

1122
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:26,308
This way!

1123
01:01:32,439 --> 01:01:33,861
(BANGING)

1124
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:39,120
Keep moving!

1125
01:01:39,279 --> 01:01:41,452
Push down the trees!
Make a path!

1126
01:01:43,283 --> 01:01:45,377
Take that, random tree!

1127
01:01:45,994 --> 01:01:47,371
JUNIPER: Whoo-hoo!

1128
01:01:47,454 --> 01:01:49,627
Good job, Patchi!

1129
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:53,710
(ROARS)

1130
01:01:53,793 --> 01:01:56,012
Hey! He's taking my herd!

1131
01:01:56,171 --> 01:01:57,798
Oh, so cold!

1132
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:02,136
ALEX: <i>Patchi's quick thinking had
saved the herd from</i> a <i>frigid fate...</i>

1133
01:02:02,302 --> 01:02:04,851
<i>...but not everyone was
grateful for his heroics.</i>

1134
01:02:05,013 --> 01:02:06,014
SCOWLER: Come on!

1135
01:02:06,181 --> 01:02:07,728
Hey, who do you
think you are, huh?!

1136
01:02:07,891 --> 01:02:10,565
Boy, looks like
Scowler's pretty mad, huh?

1137
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:12,650
We better just keep moving.

1138
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:20,578
Hey, Patchi!

1139
01:02:21,363 --> 01:02:24,583
Look at me!
You can't just take my herd!

1140
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:26,743
That's not
the way things are done!

1141
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:28,836
There's rules, you know!
Come here!

1142
01:02:29,079 --> 01:02:32,925
I didn't take them, all right, Scowler?
I had to get them off the ice.

1143
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:34,551
You're welcome to join us!

1144
01:02:34,709 --> 01:02:36,256
Oh, don't worry, Patchi...

1145
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:38,922
...I will find
you wherever you go!

1146
01:02:39,798 --> 01:02:41,391
And then
we'll see what's up!

1147
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:43,597
Whatever you say, Scowler.

1148
01:02:50,976 --> 01:02:54,731
ALEX: <i>The shadows grew long as the
sun kissed the Western horizon...</i>

1149
01:02:54,896 --> 01:02:58,400
<i>...casting a ghostly glow over
our fearless protagonist...</i>

1150
01:02:58,566 --> 01:03:00,364
<i>...and also on Patchi.</i>

1151
01:03:00,944 --> 01:03:03,072
I hope Scowler
wasn't serious back there.

1152
01:03:03,238 --> 01:03:06,287
He's probably just letting off steam.
He'll get over it.

1153
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:07,792
SCOWLER: Surprise! Ha ha!

1154
01:03:07,951 --> 01:03:10,045
So glad you're here,
'cause it's time

1155
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:12,251
to get down to business, Patchi!

1156
01:03:12,414 --> 01:03:14,291
Okay. He's not over it.

1157
01:03:23,008 --> 01:03:25,010
Just ignore him.
Let's keep going.

1158
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:27,099
You're right, come on.

1159
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:30,815
Hey, Patchi, where you off to
in such a hurry, huh?

1160
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:32,563
(ROARS)

1161
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:37,773
Patchi, don't engage him,
don't take the bait.

1162
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:39,991
What do you want, Scowler?

1163
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:42,736
You stole my herd,
you stole my girl

1164
01:03:42,902 --> 01:03:45,200
and now you're
gonna pay for it.

1165
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:46,660
You crossed the line.

1166
01:03:47,615 --> 01:03:51,495
You crossed the line when you almost
got everyone killed back there.

1167
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:55,006
Tough talk for a little guy.
Let's see if you can back it up.

1168
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:56,378
(ROARS)

1169
01:03:59,336 --> 01:04:03,011
You can have the herd,
but you're not taking Juniper.

1170
01:04:03,173 --> 01:04:06,302
You don't have to do this, Patchi,
you don't have to fight him.

01:04:12,223 --> 01:04:13,896

(CHIRPS)

1173
01:04:49,969 --> 01:04:51,937
Last chance to walk away!

1174
01:04:52,097 --> 01:04:53,519
What's it gonna be?

1175
01:04:53,681 --> 01:04:56,230
This ends here!

1176
01:05:14,661 --> 01:05:15,662
SCOWLER: Give up!

1177
01:05:15,829 --> 01:05:17,251
Yeah, come on!

1178
01:05:25,547 --> 01:05:27,845
Oh, you're
tougher than I thought.

1179
01:05:59,998 --> 01:06:01,716
You want some more, Patch?

1180
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:03,042
That's what I thought.

1181
01:06:03,418 --> 01:06:06,638
And by the way,
you're out of the herd.

1182
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:10,308
Move out!

1183
01:06:18,016 --> 01:06:19,609
JUNIPER: Patchi,
are you all right?!

1184
01:06:20,477 --> 01:06:21,774
Patchi?

1185
01:06:21,936 --> 01:06:25,486
Okay, hang in there, I'm gonna help you.
(GROWLING)

1186
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:31,079
What are you doing, Juniper? I said move out.
You know the rules.

1187
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:35,120
You can't just leave him like
that, he's your brother.

1188
01:06:35,283 --> 01:06:36,830
I don't have a brother.

1189
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:39,087
Now get back to the herd!

1190
01:06:41,706 --> 01:06:44,334
Juniper, don't go.

1191
01:06:46,044 --> 01:06:48,217
ALEX: <i>Well, this is the way
it goes for some of us.</i>

1192
01:06:48,379 --> 01:06:50,882
<i>We try our best,
we fight the good fight...</i>

1193
01:06:51,049 --> 01:06:55,930
<i>...and yet we cannot succeed
against the greater forces.</i>

1194
01:06:57,055 --> 01:06:59,353
<i>Aye, poor Patchi.
Lying helpless</i>

1195
01:06:59,474 --> 01:07:01,818
<i>with the weight of
the world on his shoulders.</i>

1196
01:07:01,976 --> 01:07:05,105
<i>What could bring him back
from the brink of despair?</i>

1197
01:07:05,271 --> 01:07:07,945
<i>Well, that's what friends are for.</i>

1198
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:11,577
Patchi! (TAPPING)

1199
01:07:12,403 --> 01:07:13,450
Patchi?

1200
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:16,033
Patchi, come on,
you've got to get up, buddy.

1201
01:07:16,199 --> 01:07:18,076
Come on, Patchi, please.
Talk to me.

1202
01:07:18,243 --> 01:07:20,211
What is the problem?
Are you hurt?

1203
01:07:20,662 --> 01:07:22,039
How 'bout now?

1204
01:07:22,789 --> 01:07:26,760
And what about this?
Does that hurt? A little bit?

1205
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:30,964
Uh-oh. Scavengers!

1206
01:07:32,632 --> 01:07:34,009
Hey! Get out of here!

1207
01:07:34,467 --> 01:07:36,686
Return to your home,
nothing to see here! Go away!

1208
01:07:36,844 --> 01:07:38,642
Shoo, shoo!

1209
01:07:38,805 --> 01:07:40,398
Patchi, get up!

1210
01:07:40,557 --> 01:07:41,558
PATCHI: No.

1211
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:43,317
This is where I belong.

1212
01:07:43,476 --> 01:07:48,403
Aw, Alex, what an idiot I was,
trying to be the big man...

1213
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:51,910
...thinking I could beat
Scowler and be with Juniper.

1214
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:56,164
No, my friend, you are confusing
ambition with destiny!

1215
01:07:56,322 --> 01:07:57,665
Now, I told you
when you were little

1216
01:07:57,824 --> 01:07:59,167
that you were
going to be a hero!

1217
01:07:59,325 --> 01:08:01,327
And an Alexornis never lies!

1218
01:08:01,494 --> 01:08:04,247
Patchi, please, these guys
aren't fooling around, okay?

1219
01:08:04,414 --> 01:08:05,961
They're gonna
have a dinner party

1220
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:07,629
and I'm telling you,
you're the main course!

1221
01:08:07,709 --> 01:08:08,756
PATCHI: Good.

1222
01:08:08,835 --> 01:08:11,839
Shame on you. Imagine what your
father, Bulldust, would say to that.

1223
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:13,006
I don't care.

1224
01:08:13,172 --> 01:08:14,173
I have no reason to--

1225
01:08:14,382 --> 01:08:15,884
Ouch! Okay, that hurt.

1226
01:08:16,342 --> 01:08:18,344
Uh-oh. More customers.

1227
01:08:19,387 --> 01:08:20,764
Come on, move it, big guy!

1228
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:23,024
Alex, would you just go away?

1229
01:08:23,182 --> 01:08:25,059
I don't want you to see this.

1230
01:08:25,226 --> 01:08:27,024
No, Patchi!
Don't let this happen!

1231
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:29,735
Come on!
Just get it over with.

1232
01:08:29,897 --> 01:08:31,695
Put me out of my misery.

1233
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:35,361
Ow!

1234
01:08:35,528 --> 01:08:36,529
Patchi...

1235
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:38,122
...listen to me.

1236
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:40,617
Do not die in vain.

1237
01:08:40,867 --> 01:08:45,293
If you're going to die, die for
something like your father did.

1238
01:08:45,455 --> 01:08:47,378
He died for you.

1239
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:50,134
<i>But you have
someone to live for.</i>

1240

01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:57,133

Get up! Get up, Patchi!

Get it off me!

1246
01:09:07,060 --> 01:09:09,062
You are not
a piece of meat.

1247
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:11,318
I am not a piece of meat!

1248
01:09:11,731 --> 01:09:13,404
Get outta here!

I'm not afraid of anyone!

1252
01:09:28,414 --> 01:09:31,759
Wow, that was something! What
did you eat for breakfast?

1253
01:09:31,918 --> 01:09:34,592
PATCHI: I ate a bush,
if you must know.

1254
01:09:39,801 --> 01:09:42,099
I'm back! Yes!

1255
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:47,476
Look out!
Pachyrhinosaur, on the move!

1256
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:51,029
Yes, Patchi, lumber!

01:09:51,312 --> 01:09:53,531
Lumber like the wind!

1258
01:09:55,983 --> 01:09:58,281
What are you looking at?
Scram, punks!

1259
01:09:59,987 --> 01:10:02,536
Gotta get back,

I made it.

Juniper!

Hey, everybody!
Has anyone seen Juniper?

Anyone? Anyone.

01:10:56,002 --> 01:10:57,800
Just a quick yes or no.

ALEX: <i>Both sides
battled ferociously...</i>

1339
01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:31,555
<i>...but the Pachyrhinosaurs had one
thing the Gorgosaurs did not:</i>

1340
01:14:31,717 --> 01:14:33,560
<i>A former runt with
a hole in his head...</i>

1341
01:14:34,053 --> 01:14:35,976
<i>...and a lion in his heart.</i>

1342
01:14:39,058 --> 01:14:41,060
<i>But even
the greatest of heroes...</i>

1343
01:14:41,227 --> 01:14:44,652

from a lucky break.</i>

That's so you'll remember me!

1348
01:15:09,755 --> 01:15:13,100
That's right, you heard me.
Get out of here!

1349
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:20,642
Name's Patchi!
And I'll see you next winter!

1351
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:37,041
I don't believe it.
Patchi did it!

1352
01:15:45,332 --> 01:15:48,211
I was distracted. What happened?
Did we win'?

1353
01:15:48,377 --> 01:15:50,379
What happened? Payback.

1354
01:15:50,629 --> 01:15:52,506
That's what happened.

1355
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:56,973

he'd been through,</i>

1357
01:15:59,305 --> 01:16:01,307
<i>Patchi's moment
had finally arrived.</i>

1358
01:16:01,474 --> 01:16:04,353
<i>He was the undisputed
leader of the herd...</i>

1359
01:16:04,518 --> 01:16:06,896
<i>...and nobody was
prouder than me.</i>

1360
01:16:07,855 --> 01:16:09,107
You hurt, Scowler?

1361
01:16:09,273 --> 01:16:10,866
I'm okay. Thanks.

1362
01:16:11,067 --> 01:16:14,947
You know, Patch, you didn't
have to do that after...

1363
01:16:15,112 --> 01:16:17,035
...you know,
what I did to you.

1364
01:16:17,198 --> 01:16:18,415
So I just wanted to say--
(ROARS LOUDLY)

1365
01:16:21,327 --> 01:16:22,954
I deserve that.

1366
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:26,378
Guess this means you're the
leader of the herd now.

1367
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:28,542
So, you might as well
go ahead and say it.

1368
01:16:28,709 --> 01:16:29,961
Really? Okay.

1369
01:16:30,127 --> 01:16:32,004
Well, let's move 'em out!

01:16:32,588 --> 01:16:33,589
SCOWLER: Sounds good.

1371
01:16:33,756 --> 01:16:35,554
PATCHI: Yeah,
that felt pretty good.

1372
01:16:36,175 --> 01:16:38,769
Hey, Patchi, you were
pretty great out there.

1373
01:16:38,928 --> 01:16:42,398
Yeah, you too. Remind me
never to headbutt with you.

1374
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:45,147
Juniper, listen, it's time
to talk about the future.

1375
01:16:45,309 --> 01:16:47,687
You mean the Cenozoic era?

1376
01:16:47,853 --> 01:16:51,198
No, I mean
the Patchi and Juniper era.

1377
01:16:51,357 --> 01:16:54,327
Oh, I think I'm
gonna like the future.

1378

ALEX: <i>With the herd
at his heels,</i>

1379
01:17:07,206 --> 01:17:10,130
<i>Patchi walked across
the grasslands of Alaska...</i>

1380
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:11,714
<i>...and into the future.</i>

1381
01:17:13,921 --> 01:17:17,425
<i>Which, as always,
was full of surprises.</i>

1382
01:17:22,972 --> 01:17:24,315
PATCHI: Excuse me?!

1383
01:17:25,266 --> 01:17:26,939
Hi, there. Can I
help you find something?

1384
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:29,153
No'? You sure?

1385
01:17:29,311 --> 01:17:31,564
Okay, then get out!
(SHRIEKS)

1386
01:17:32,982 --> 01:17:35,861
Go back to turkey
town and stay out!

1387
01:17:36,026 --> 01:17:39,030
Patchi, are you messing
with the Troodons again?

1388
01:17:39,196 --> 01:17:41,164
I thought I asked
you to watch the eggs.

1389
01:17:41,574 --> 01:17:45,795
I am watching them, but they
keep not doing anything.

1390
01:17:45,953 --> 01:17:49,628
I told you, it takes time.
You have to be patient.

1391
01:17:49,790 --> 01:17:52,339
PATCHI: I know, but we're
talking about our whole future.

1392
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:55,425
Why does the future always
take so long to get here?

1393
01:17:56,714 --> 01:17:59,092
JUNIPER: Shh! You hear that?

1394
01:18:00,759 --> 01:18:02,887
It's time, Patchi.
This is it!

1395
01:18:03,053 --> 01:18:04,805
I don't believe it.

1396
01:18:07,975 --> 01:18:10,353
Wow, look at that!

1397
01:18:10,436 --> 01:18:12,564
Oh, he's beautiful.

1398
01:18:12,771 --> 01:18:14,239
He looks just
like his old man.

1399
01:18:14,648 --> 01:18:17,902
Well, if he's anything like
you, we'll have our hands full.
