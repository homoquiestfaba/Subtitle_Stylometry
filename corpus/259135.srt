00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:54,019
Yeah, a little.

4
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:58,650
- Sure is a lonely road.
- Nice try, but no.

5
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:02,421
Aw, come on, Dad.
Let me drive. I know how.

6
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:05,396
You can navigate.
You're a great navigator.

7
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:08,729
When I was your age,
I was a terrific navigator.

8
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:11,030
- Dad, look out!
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

9
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:27,885
You stay here.

10
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:30,581
What happened? I just about hit you.
You're lucky to be alive.

11
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,783
You're right.
It's totally my fault.

12
00:01:32,892 --> 00:01:36,293
I heard you coming,
and I just didn't want you to miss me.

13
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:37,886
Yeah, well, is everything okay?

14
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:39,692
Yeah, you?

15
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:42,859
- Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.
- Hey, look, I'm real sorry.

16
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:44,994
A deer ran out in front of us,
and I swerved to miss it...

17
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:48,700
- and, well, you can see for yourself.
- [Thunder Rumbling]

18
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:51,800
At least Molly and I are okay.
I tried to back out...

19
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:54,106
but it looks like
I dug ourselves in deeper.

20
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:57,411
- This is my wife Molly.
- Hi.

21
00:01:57,517 --> 00:01:59,508
- And I'm Woodrow Lovell.
- Dennis Conway.

22
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,280
- Nice to meet you.
- Cool car.

23
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:04,220
This is my son Nick.
I told you to stay in the van.

24
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:08,158
- Maybe the four of us could
push it back on the road.
- I think it's in deeper than that.

25
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:11,992
I have some chains in the trunk,
if you wouldn't mind hitching us
to the back of your van.

26
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,094
I'll take a look.

Why is what you're looking for
always on the bottom?

28

Take that, Molly.

29
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:33,182
Careful. Careful.

30
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:35,686

We can do this, okay?

Better hurry. It's going to rain.

33
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:46,996
Just relax.
We'll be out of here in a minute, okay?

34
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:56,541
[Dennis]
Okay, Woodrow!

35
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:58,611
Don't worry, it'll be okay.

36
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:00,838
I'm not a very good traveler.

37
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:04,942
Well, my dad and my grandma
started me young.

38

we would take a trip out west.

I wish I'd seen more of the world.

Thank heavens
you were kind enough to help.

43
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:38,114
- I don't know what we
would've done without you.
- No trouble at all.

- Not bad, Dad.
- It's a Chevy. You got the chain?

45
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:43,614
- It worked!
- Thank you so much.

46
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:46,419
This Impala's in great shape.
What is it, '60, '61?

47
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:47,823
Yeah, it's a '61. That's right.

48
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:50,020
- You into vintage cars?
- Yeah, a little bit.

49
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:53,724
Forgive me for being so rude,
but we're behind schedule already.

50

a place to stay tonight too.

I doubt it.

63
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:00,998

I saw it on the map.

65

- Let's drop it off for 'em.
- All right.

66
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:08,100
Come on.

67
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:30,996
Uh-uh-uh.
That's not ours.

68
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:34,089
Maybe there's something gruesome in it,
and they wanted us to find it...

69
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,690
so we'd get blamed
for the murder.

70
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:38,202
Come on, Dad. Admit it.
Weren't they a little weird?

71
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:40,295
What do you mean?

72
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:42,840

We don't have a contingency plan.

I don't know,
but I'll think of something.
I just can't go any further.

Don't.

identification, please?

- Yeah.

You're a long way from home,
Mr. Conway.

94
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:16,593
Yeah. I'm on vacation with my son.

95

I didn't know
I needed a permit for that.

96
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,935
- Is there a problem or something?
- Nope.

97
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:28,405
Look. I just found this duffel,
and the tag on it said 54 Glover Road...

98
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,976
so I was just trying to do
a favor and drop it off.

99
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:34,945
- You found that bag where?
- Well, the couple... Molly and Woodrow...

100
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:37,641
they had some car trouble
up in the mountains.

101
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,718
- What kind of trouble?
- Well, they got stuck.

102
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:42,287
It wasn't an accident.
Nobody got hurt.

103
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:45,221
But when they drove off,
they left the duffel, so...

104
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:47,315
Well, I'll make sure they get it.

105
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:48,825
Yeah.

106
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:51,761
Okay. I mean,
this is their house, right?

107
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,729
Yes, it is, but no one's home.

108
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:57,462
When we drove up,
the lights were on.

109
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:01,006
Well, that's probably
just an automatic timer.

You and your son have a safe trip.

in the direction of the closest motel?

Well, I'll tell you what.

As soon as that gas station opens
down there...

123
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:47,107
we'll get gas, grub,
and we'll hit the dusty trail.

00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:48,805

125

We got no choice, unless there's
another gas station open in town.

Haven't seen you in here before.

You get lost
or are you just passing through?

My grandma used to make 'em
from scratch.

She would use chocolate chips
and bananas too.

- Hi. Mr. Conway?

220
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:40,385
So Nick's gonna be fine, but his
left tibia and his fibula are broken.

goes down before we can cast.

00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,047
What's the problem now?

340
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:15,522
- This is private property.
- But I didn't see any signs.

341
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:20,724
The people that live here
don't need signs to know
where the boundaries are.

342
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:25,768
You keep a lot in your head,
don't you?

343
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,703
The big stuff. Yeah.

344
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:30,900
I'll drive you to town.

345
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:44,847
[Dennis]
You a Mariners fan?

346
00:28:44,956 --> 00:28:47,948
McGwire's chasing the record again.

347
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:55,659
You ever see him hit?
Powerful.

348
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:58,668
Yankee fan, myself.

349
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:01,898
Yeah, Yankee Stadium,
house that Ruth built.

350
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:05,942
Well, before Steinbrenner.

351
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:08,410
It's pretty exciting to watch
those guys knock 'em out.

352
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:11,209
That Griffey,
he does it almost every game.

353
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:15,116
I always watch, hoping he's gonna
wail another one out, you know.

354
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,120
A little bit of history.

355
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:23,794
You watch baseball?

356
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,020
Okay.

357
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:34,763
Can you drop me off over there?

358
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:48,479
You know,
you really ought to catch a game.

359
00:29:50,755 --> 00:29:53,383
I saw the Babe hit number 60,
you jerk.

360
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:22,116
Hi. You guys don't waste any time.

361
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:29,155
Woodrow and Molly.

362
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:32,024
Yes.

363
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:36,760
Say, how come there are no dates
on any of the headstones?

364
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:40,530
We know when they died.

365
00:30:40,638 --> 00:30:42,538
Ah.

366
00:30:56,721 --> 00:30:59,554
Doc. Official business?

367
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:04,219
Woodrow and Molly's paperwork.
I just faxed it to the state recorder.

368
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:10,361
Sophie, it wouldn't have mattered...
the Lovells staying or leaving.

369
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:13,266
Yeah. That's what I've been
trying to tell myself...

370
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:16,135
but I saw their bodies.

371
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:17,708
And?

372
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:20,403
And they weren't
the way we knew them.

373
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:23,002
They were so old.

374
00:31:23,114 --> 00:31:26,481
Isn't it better what happens here...

375
00:31:26,584 --> 00:31:29,417
instead of just leaving it to chance?

376
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:34,685
I don't know. It seems our tradition
isn't exactly very humane either.

377
00:31:34,792 --> 00:31:38,592
Easy, easy.

378
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:42,291
Yeah. Yeah, I know.
I know.

379
00:31:47,272 --> 00:31:49,740
Conway. Do you talk to him much?

380
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:51,809
A bit.

381
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,504
Oh. I know that look.

382
00:31:54,612 --> 00:31:58,070
- No, it's nothing.
- Uh-huh, uh-huh.

383
00:31:58,182 --> 00:31:59,672
He seems like a nice guy.

384
00:31:59,784 --> 00:32:03,914
I hope for his sake
he puts Springville behind him.

385
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:06,286
Yeah, for his sake.

386
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:20,895
Hi.

387
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:23,269
So, did you see what there is to see
of Springville?

388
00:32:23,374 --> 00:32:26,400
Yeah. It seems like
a decent place to live.

389
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:28,502
I'm starving.
Have you had dinner?

390
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,171
Uh, no, but, uh...

391
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:33,580
Don't worry. The night shift's on duty,
and we'll just be out front.

392
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:35,448
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

393
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:43,925
And so Gus runs out of the hospital,
still in his hospital gown...

394
00:32:44,028 --> 00:32:47,589
running out into the woods.

395
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:52,898
Hmm. Do you mind if I ask you
a personal question that is
absolutely none of my business?

396
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:55,370
Fire away.

397
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,065
Where's Nick's mom?

398
00:32:57,175 --> 00:33:00,110
Hmm. You didn't see
the police report?

399
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:03,104
Uh-oh. I thought they made
copies for everyone.

400
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:07,913
In their minds, they're just protecting
the town. They mean well.

401
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:10,749
My wife died of cancer
when Nick was three.

402
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:13,824
- My mom was helping me raise him.
- Was?

403
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:16,655
Yeah. She passed away
a few months ago.

404
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:20,891
She'd been suffering from Alzheimer's
for the past few years, so...

405
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,763
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.

406
00:33:23,868 --> 00:33:27,235
Before the disease, she was smart,
she was adventurous...

407
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:29,363
great sense of humor.

408
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:32,307
Then she slowly turned into
somebody I didn't know.

409
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:34,173
How's Nick coping?

410
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:38,638
We pray about it sometimes.
That gets him talking.

411
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,719
I think he's gonna be okay.

412
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:43,184
I lost my son.

413
00:33:43,287 --> 00:33:45,653
I can't imagine that.
That must be unbearable.

414
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:50,254
Never stops hurting.

415
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:52,693
But life goes on and things change.

416
00:33:56,534 --> 00:34:00,300
Mind if I ask you a personal question,
which is absolutely none of my business?

417
00:34:00,405 --> 00:34:03,169
- Fire away.
- [Dennis Chuckles]

418
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:05,942
Are you married?

419
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:10,373
Not anymore.

420
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:30,960
[Sophie]
You're doing great, Nick.
I'm almost done.

421
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:35,231
Okay. You'll feel better soon.

422
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,134
Caleb Dunn,
clinic administrator.

423
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:43,703
- I'm sorry about your son's accident.
- Oh, thank you.

424
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:46,784
So, how's our young patient
this morning?

425
00:34:46,884 --> 00:34:49,717
Are we ready to give him
his walking papers?

426
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:52,949
I can't cast him
till tomorrow at least.

427
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:56,584
There must be something you could do.
Mr. Conway's been more than patient.

428
00:34:56,694 --> 00:35:00,687
- No, not without jeopardizing Nick.
- Right. We wouldn't want that.

429
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:06,863
I have an idea. Since the accident
occurred in Springville...

430
00:35:06,971 --> 00:35:10,498
the city could pay to have Nick
transported to the hospital
in Lexington.

431
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:13,202
They have much more sophisticated
equipment there.

432
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:16,007
Well, I think we'd rather
stay here. Thanks.

433
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,014
Right, Nick?

434
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:21,051
It's your decision, Mr. Conway.

435
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:24,019
Sophie, can we speak privately?

436
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:27,290
Excuse me.

437
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,832
Dad, I think
she's got a crush on you.

438
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:39,300
Yeah? What makes you say that?

439
00:35:39,403 --> 00:35:41,371
'Cause she's always coming
to check up on me.

440
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:45,704
- Well, maybe she's got a crush on you.
- No. It's the way she looks at you.

441
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:49,302
- How does she look at me?
- Like you're the only one in the room.

442
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:51,438
That's good.

443
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:55,485
Sophie, this is completely unacceptable.
We have to cast that kid today.

444
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:58,555
I can't. I'll have to go through
the whole thing again.

445
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:03,059
- He may never even heal properly.
- What about tonight?

446
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:06,062
Don't worry.
I'll take care of him.

447
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:14,998
Come on, Carol.
We've been through this before.

448
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:18,803
You always said you were
gonna be there for me.

449
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:23,176
I know, Jack, but I can't.

450
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:28,776
I don't want to let you down,
but I just can't.

451
00:36:30,454 --> 00:36:32,649
I understand.

452
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:37,089
I understand.

453
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,095
Shh.

454
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,679
Yeah, right there.

455
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,613
Yeah. Maybe one of those logs
bounced off your head, hmm?

456
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,479
It sure feels like it.

457
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:04,282
I'm proud of you.
You risked your life to save that kid.

458
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,481
I didn't even think.
There wasn't time.

459
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:09,151
You've got good instincts, thank God.

460
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,956
Ahem.

461
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:14,964
- Wow. You look great.
- Thank you.

462
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,397
Do you got a hot date?

463
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,799
No, just a business thing...
a fund-raiser for the clinic.

464
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,701
To tell you the truth,
I wish I didn't have to go.

465
00:37:21,806 --> 00:37:24,502
- Ditch it then.
- I can't.

466
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:27,407
Can I interest either of you in dessert?

467
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:29,672
Ah, that depends.
Is it from the diner?

468
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,805
Even better.
Made it myself.

469
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,850
- You made this?
- Mm-hmm.

470
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:35,851
Boiled the water and opened the box.

471
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:37,978
Chocolate's my favorite.

472
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,148
Well, enjoy. I've gotta run.

473
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:44,194
Um, hey, am I gonna,
uh, see you later?

474
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:48,595
Probably not. These political things
tend to last forever.

475
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:50,929
- Good-bye.
- Bye.

476
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,839
There's no way
she's got a crush on me.

477
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,841
You are so wrong.

478
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:02,106
- Grandma taught me how women work.
- Did she?

479
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:05,614
She said that she tried to tell you,
but you couldn't catch a clue.

480
00:38:05,716 --> 00:38:08,617
[Chuckles]

481
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:10,482
** [Jazz]

482
00:38:19,196 --> 00:38:20,493
Are we okay to go?

483
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:22,031
<i>[Sophie]</i>
<i>The sleeping pills worked.</i>

484
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,498
<i>Are you sure?</i>

485
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:26,229
Yes, Tim.
They'll be sleeping till morning.

486
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:28,805
<i>Get over here as soon as you can.</i>

487
00:38:28,906 --> 00:38:33,900
I was thinking, just to be totally safe,
maybe I should stay here.

488
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:37,572
You can't. We need you here.
I've got a feeling Jack might need help.

489
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:41,244
All right.

490
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:57,396
- Happy birthday, Jack.
- Thanks.

491
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,469
Where's Carol?

492
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:02,061
She changed her mind.

493
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:05,006
I'll be there for you.

494
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:08,078
There he is.

495
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:12,607
Happy birthday, Jack.

496
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:17,044
- Let's get you a drink.
- Ooh. I second that.

497
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:21,824
- Hey.
- There's the man.

498
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:24,986
Happy birthday, Jack.
Where's Carol?

499
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:57,257
- I loved that.
- You are so cute, Jack.

500
00:39:57,361 --> 00:40:00,125
Jack, it's almost dawn.

501
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:19,807
[Tim]
Everyone, it's time.

502
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:26,080
Who will help our friend
to cross the spring?

503
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:30,024
I will. I'll be his guide.

504
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:34,564
Jack Pendergast, it is first light...

505
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:40,069
on the day commemorating your birth
in Springville in the year 1900.

506
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:44,801
- Happy birthday, old friend.
- Happy birthday, Jack.

507
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:48,944

And was the Great Depression
really that depressing?

the spring with the world,
wars would be fought over it...

would come here hoping,

00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:37,321
You need to stay here, okay?

676
00:56:37,427 --> 00:56:38,621
I'm comin' with you.

677
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:40,696
You're not a citizen.

678
00:56:56,479 --> 00:56:59,642
- Best to be assertive?
- Just be honest.

679
00:57:01,217 --> 00:57:03,117
You're gonna have to stay here.

680
00:57:03,219 --> 00:57:05,551
I want my chance to speak.

681
00:57:05,655 --> 00:57:07,816
I'm sure you do.

682
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:10,324
Megan, make sure
he doesn't go anywhere.

683
00:57:15,865 --> 00:57:17,992
[Tim] Admit that you told them
about the spring.

684
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:20,194
I didn't. Dennis...

685
00:57:20,303 --> 00:57:23,431
Mr. Conway had already
figured most of it out.

686
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:26,600
- So you filled in the missing pieces?
- I had no choice.

687
00:57:26,709 --> 00:57:28,836
[Emma]
That's not entirely true, Sophie.

688
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:31,880
You had a little something
to do with it.

689
00:57:31,981 --> 00:57:34,142
You've been encouraging him
since he showed up.

690
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:37,686
Emma, even if I were lucky enough
to fall in love at my age...

691
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:40,779
I would never risk the lives
of my friends.

692
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:42,790
I believe you, Sophie.

693
00:57:42,892 --> 00:57:46,623
- Can we trust him, though?
- Yes. For heaven's sakes, Robert...

694
00:57:46,729 --> 00:57:49,391
he came here to return
your parents' bag.

695
00:57:49,499 --> 00:57:53,595
He's not a man who could
hurt someone for profit.

696
00:57:53,703 --> 00:57:57,366
I mean, he would never
sell out our secret for money.

697
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:59,669
You don't know for sure.

698
00:57:59,776 --> 00:58:01,744
Does he know about
Jack's birthday party?

699
00:58:01,845 --> 00:58:04,837
I wanted to tell him,
but Nick was nearby.

700
00:58:04,948 --> 00:58:06,540
He won't be 18 for five years.

701
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:09,675
They all know anyway.

702
00:58:09,786 --> 00:58:13,313
- If we vote no, what happens to him?
- You know the covenant.

703
00:58:13,423 --> 00:58:17,154
We can't punish him like someone
who purposely broke the covenant.

704
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:19,626
Besides, we have Nick to consider.
He hasn't done anything wrong.

705
00:58:19,729 --> 00:58:25,133
No matter how nice they may seem,
any unknown element poses a threat.

706
00:58:25,235 --> 00:58:28,864
He won't tell anyone
if we let him stay.

707
00:58:28,972 --> 00:58:32,135
Josh, what do you think?

708
00:58:39,949 --> 00:58:43,112
They've agreed
to let you speak for yourself.

709
00:58:47,156 --> 00:58:49,056
[Tim]
Why do you want to stay in Springville?

710
00:58:49,158 --> 00:58:52,594
What do you want from us,
and what are you prepared to give?

711
00:58:56,733 --> 00:59:00,362
Well, I want a safe world
for my son to grow up in.

712
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:05,601
I'd rather he not experience
the kind of pain or disease
that my wife and mother had to.

713
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:10,377
I want Nick to reach his potential
and then to go beyond that.

714
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:14,348
That's what you want for your son.
What do you want for yourself?

715
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:19,410
- That's all I want for myself.
- You're not being honest, Dennis.

716
00:59:19,522 --> 00:59:21,854
Everyone wants something.

717
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:30,127
My wife died when she was 24.

718
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:34,135
There was nothing I could do
to stop her pain or her death.

719
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:37,695
After that, the future for me
was an illusion.

720
00:59:37,807 --> 00:59:41,208
Everything could be just
snatched away in a heartbeat.

721
00:59:41,311 --> 00:59:44,109
I had two people to love:
My son, my mother.

722
00:59:44,213 --> 00:59:48,115
I wasn't about to risk
loving anybody else...

723
00:59:48,217 --> 00:59:51,152
until now.

724
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:53,381
[Tim]
Now?

725
00:59:53,489 --> 00:59:57,425
I don't think it's an accident
that I'm here in Springville.

726
00:59:57,527 --> 01:00:02,590
Are you prepared to commit yourself and
your son to the covenant of this town?

727
01:00:05,234 --> 01:00:07,134
Yes, I am.

728
01:00:08,371 --> 01:00:12,364
- What do you think?
- That's not my job.

729
01:00:12,475 --> 01:00:14,500
- Mr. Conway?
- Yeah.

730
01:00:30,026 --> 01:00:33,928
Mr. Conway,
the council has decided...

731
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:36,328
although not unanimously...

732
01:00:36,432 --> 01:00:40,129
to grant you and your son
conditional residency in Springville.

733
01:00:40,236 --> 01:00:42,295
Oh, thank you very much.

734
01:00:43,506 --> 01:00:46,907
So conditionally,
welcome to Springville.

735
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:50,173
Welcome to Springville. You know,
you've actually got me believing...

736
01:00:50,279 --> 01:00:53,180
we might get my Vette
running, after all.

737
01:01:11,734 --> 01:01:14,862
You guys make it sound
like it's a disease.
I mean, I like old people.

738
01:01:14,971 --> 01:01:18,429
- I loved my grandma.
- Well, I love mine too.

739
01:01:20,243 --> 01:01:22,074
- Oh, nice!
- How old is she?

740
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:24,476
Uh, I don't know.

741
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:28,448
See, at least if I didn't know
how old somebody was,
I had a general idea, you know?

742
01:01:28,551 --> 01:01:31,714
Yeah, but what's it
really matter, you know?

743
01:01:31,821 --> 01:01:34,415
So you know
how to treat 'em... nicer.

744
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:37,960
- Why? You treat everybody else lousy?
- No. Just the geeks.

745
01:01:38,061 --> 01:01:39,892
No, I mean...

746
01:01:39,996 --> 01:01:43,329
It's like, where's the order of things?
Who can you hang out with?

747
01:01:43,433 --> 01:01:46,834
Who's gonna get your music
and not hassle you about your clothes?

748
01:01:46,936 --> 01:01:50,235
Yeah. Well, you know,
I get your music.

749
01:01:50,339 --> 01:01:52,500
That's 'cause
we're the same age, right?

750
01:01:52,608 --> 01:01:55,270
- Right?
- Uh, well...

751
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:59,781
I don't remember,
but they told me I was 13.

752
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:03,147
Well, I don't remember being born,
so I guess that's what they tell me too.

753
01:02:03,252 --> 01:02:05,186
- Yeah, right.
- Hey, Dad.

754
01:02:05,288 --> 01:02:06,755
Hey.

755
01:02:06,856 --> 01:02:08,824
Help me out with
one of these suitcases, huh, prince?

756
01:02:08,925 --> 01:02:10,825
- Hey, Dylan, that's for you.
- Oh, thanks.

757
01:02:10,927 --> 01:02:14,522
- Gotta help out the old guy.
- Of course.

758
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:16,825
- Hi, Sophie.
- Hey, how you guys doin'?

759
01:02:16,933 --> 01:02:18,696
Hi.

760
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:22,867
- You're sure this is all right?
- Oh, no, it's a big house.

761
01:02:22,972 --> 01:02:26,169
I got plenty of room.
It'll be nice to share it with somebody.

762
01:02:26,275 --> 01:02:28,903
All right.
Well, just till something else opens up.

763
01:02:29,011 --> 01:02:32,708
In Springville, it could be awhile.
You want a little help with that?

764
01:02:32,815 --> 01:02:34,942
- No, I think I can manage.
- You sure?

765
01:02:49,398 --> 01:02:54,165
I don't know about you,
but I don't trust that Conway
as far as I can throw him.

766
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:58,138
Not trusting Conway's a given.
What about Sophie?

767
01:02:58,241 --> 01:03:00,266
Can we still trust her?

768
01:03:01,344 --> 01:03:03,278

This smells great.

769
01:03:03,379 --> 01:03:05,142
Emma's a wonderful cook.

770
01:03:05,248 --> 01:03:07,648
I have to warn you, though.
I am terrible.

771
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:11,049
Did you ever leave Springville
for any length of time?

772
01:03:11,154 --> 01:03:15,921
Yes. I left when I went to med school,
after my son died.

773
01:03:16,025 --> 01:03:18,084
It was too painful to stay here.

774
01:03:18,194 --> 01:03:20,253
What happened?
Why couldn't the water keep him safe?

775
01:03:20,363 --> 01:03:23,332
Well, he enlisted during World War II.

776
01:03:23,432 --> 01:03:25,923
That was his photograph on your desk.

777
01:03:26,035 --> 01:03:27,764
Yeah.

778
01:03:30,907 --> 01:03:33,899
Is his father still alive?

779
01:03:34,010 --> 01:03:36,774
His father was Gus.

780
01:03:36,879 --> 01:03:38,813
Gus?

781
01:03:38,915 --> 01:03:41,076
- Gus and I were
high school sweethearts.
- Really?

782
01:03:41,184 --> 01:03:43,414
We got married when we were young.

783
01:03:43,519 --> 01:03:47,353
Even if we were perfect soulmates,
I don't think we would have lasted
the 82 years.

784
01:03:47,456 --> 01:03:51,517
And when a child dies...

785
01:03:51,627 --> 01:03:53,857
Well, for us, it was the end.

786
01:03:53,963 --> 01:03:56,022
Yeah.

787
01:03:56,132 --> 01:04:00,330
I promised myself after that
that I would live in the moment.

788
01:04:02,405 --> 01:04:05,135
But I haven't.

789
01:04:05,241 --> 01:04:08,210
Why not?

790
01:04:08,311 --> 01:04:11,371
Right now I can't imagine.

791
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:22,723
I don't want to lead you on.

792
01:04:22,825 --> 01:04:24,725
You already have.

793
01:04:29,131 --> 01:04:31,361

Lookin' sharp.

795
01:04:36,105 --> 01:04:38,767
So I hear you're staying at Sophie's.

796
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:45,044
Word travels fast.
I hear you were her husband.

797
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:50,208
That I was.

798
01:04:51,954 --> 01:04:54,650
And you never forget
your first, Dennis.

799
01:04:54,757 --> 01:04:57,419
Sophie was my great love.

800
01:04:57,526 --> 01:05:00,893
- She's a special lady.
- That she is.

801
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:05,458
She talks like the very idea
is preposterous...

802
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:07,900
two people being in love
for 82 years...

803
01:05:08,004 --> 01:05:11,440
but I could have stayed
in love with her...

804
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:13,440
if she would have let me.

805
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:19,647
This the car you had with her?

806
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:26,813
No. My, no.
This car was Elvis, you know.

807
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:29,187
And Buddy... the '50s.

808
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:33,687
Every decade had its moments.

809
01:05:33,796 --> 01:05:36,060
I enjoyed every one of them.

810
01:05:39,869 --> 01:05:42,565

getting your hands dirty?

811
01:05:42,672 --> 01:05:46,233

- Lexington.

819
01:06:47,636 --> 01:06:50,366
Gus and I are working on his Vette,
and he needs some spare parts, so...

820
01:06:50,473 --> 01:06:53,033
- You can get those on-line.
- I wish I could.

821
01:06:53,142 --> 01:06:56,839
I'll have to hit at least a half dozen
junkyards just to get what I need.

Turn your vehicle around
and return to Springville.

You're serious.

825
01:07:05,454 --> 01:07:08,719
Mr. Conway, right now
you are a provisional citizen.

01:07:08,824 --> 01:07:14,592
That means you have absolute freedom

[Engine Revs]

843
01:09:10,079 --> 01:09:13,105
So you're just gonna stop
drinking the water then.
Just like that, right?

844
01:09:15,050 --> 01:09:17,678
No. No, not exactly.

845
01:09:17,786 --> 01:09:19,185
Well, what then?

846
01:09:21,690 --> 01:09:23,885
Gus? Gus? Hey, man.

847
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:26,860
- [Crack]
- Aah! Oh, man!

848
01:09:26,962 --> 01:09:30,762
What happened?
Lemme see, lemme see.

849
01:09:30,866 --> 01:09:34,063
- We gotta get you to the clinic, bud.
- [Groans]

850
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:35,797
It was a dumb thing to do.

851
01:09:35,905 --> 01:09:37,873
We could go to the spring,
bathe it in the water.

852
01:09:37,973 --> 01:09:40,168
It's strongest near the source.

853
01:09:41,777 --> 01:09:44,610
Gus said he had a birthday coming up.
How come you never mentioned that?

854
01:09:44,713 --> 01:09:48,114
Maybe I was trying
not to think about it.

855
01:09:48,217 --> 01:09:50,242
Yeah, well, it got me thinkin'.
I remembered what you said...

856
01:09:50,352 --> 01:09:55,380
about you and Gus bein'
high school sweethearts
and how you married young.

857
01:09:55,491 --> 01:09:58,153
And then it hit me. You're probably
gonna be 100 too. Am I right?

858
01:09:58,260 --> 01:09:59,625
More or less.

859
01:09:59,728 --> 01:10:01,992
You didn't think this was something
that we should maybe talk about?

860
01:10:02,097 --> 01:10:05,430
Nothing we say
will make any difference.

861
01:10:05,534 --> 01:10:07,729
I told you it wouldn't last forever.

862
01:10:07,836 --> 01:10:10,669
Yeah, well, I just didn't think
it would fall apart so quickly.

863
01:10:10,773 --> 01:10:13,003
Oh, there you are.

864
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:16,508
- Hi, Sophie.
- Hi.

865
01:10:16,612 --> 01:10:19,979
- How's your hand?
- It's been better.

866
01:10:20,082 --> 01:10:23,074
Would you mind
if I talked to Dennis alone?

867
01:10:23,185 --> 01:10:25,415
- No, I'm done.
- Good.

868
01:10:30,292 --> 01:10:33,853
- What's up?
- Can you keep a secret?

869

This entire town is counting on it.

870
01:10:36,098 --> 01:10:39,226
- I quit drinkin' the water.
- How come?

871
01:10:39,335 --> 01:10:43,271
Like I told you,
to see what old feels like.
You know, before my birthday.

872
01:10:43,372 --> 01:10:45,806
I don't know what's
gonna happen exactly or how long.

873
01:10:45,908 --> 01:10:49,435
Gus, why don't you just leave,
you know?

874
01:10:49,545 --> 01:10:52,309
And ruin 100 years of integrity?

875
01:10:52,414 --> 01:10:56,248
- Uh-uh. It's time to pay the piper.
- I'm sorry. I don't understand.

876
01:10:56,352 --> 01:10:58,820
It's not like I've been
cheated out of anything.

877
01:10:58,921 --> 01:11:01,822
If I hadn't been born in Springville,
I probably would have died years ago.

878
01:11:01,924 --> 01:11:05,360
And what's the downside
of doing it like this,
knowing my time and place?

879
01:11:05,461 --> 01:11:07,986
Gives you a chance to prepare,
get your things in order.

880
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:12,329
Yeah, but they never are, you know?
They never are.

881
01:11:12,434 --> 01:11:14,334
It's like this car.

882
01:11:17,673 --> 01:11:19,573
You're comin' to my birthday party?

883
01:11:19,675 --> 01:11:21,643
Yeah, I'll be there.

884
01:11:29,885 --> 01:11:32,410
All right, a good thing
about Springville is...

885
01:11:32,521 --> 01:11:36,116
if I screw up doing a trick, I could
just go and heal myself in the spring.

886
01:11:36,225 --> 01:11:38,420
- That's a good thing, right?
- Right.

887
01:11:38,527 --> 01:11:40,688
- All right, what else?
- Dad, that's it.

888
01:11:40,796 --> 01:11:42,957
There's nothing to do here.

889
01:11:43,065 --> 01:11:45,590
What about your friend, Dylan?
You've got a good buddy there.

890
01:11:45,701 --> 01:11:48,636
Yeah, but I lost about 20
back in White Plains.

891
01:11:48,737 --> 01:11:51,171
Dad, just 'cause you're a loner
doesn't mean I have to be.

892
01:11:51,273 --> 01:11:54,709
- Hey, hey.
- I said "loner," not "loser."

893
01:11:57,513 --> 01:12:00,141
Look, Nicky.

894
01:12:00,249 --> 01:12:03,685
Sometimes life gives you
these opportunities, right?

895
01:12:03,786 --> 01:12:06,414
And you've got to grab 'em
or they leave, they're gone.

896
01:12:06,522 --> 01:12:08,956
I know the transition's
gonna be hard...

897
01:12:09,058 --> 01:12:12,494
but I think living here
is gonna be better for us.

898
01:12:12,594 --> 01:12:15,427
- You know what I wish?
- Yeah?

899
01:12:15,531 --> 01:12:18,056
I wish I had never told you
to make friends with Sophie...

900
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:21,102
because if it wasn't for her,
we wouldn't be here.

901
01:12:21,203 --> 01:12:22,465
You don't know that.

902
01:12:22,571 --> 01:12:26,439
And besides,
it's not you that made it happen.

903
01:12:26,542 --> 01:12:29,773
You know,
if you did this for me...

904
01:12:29,878 --> 01:12:31,903
I don't want it,
and you know that.

905
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:34,380
So since you did it for you,
you're selfish.

906
01:12:45,761 --> 01:12:49,253
How's Gus's party comin' together?

907
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:52,300
It's gonna be great.

He's got nothin' to do with it.
We're just gonna be on our way.

I'm not staying here with my son
so they can kill us!

You've got to help me
get him to the spring.

- Maybe.

01:22:42,157 --> 01:22:44,421
We'll take him to the spring.

1009
01:22:44,526 --> 01:22:48,292
Then Springville
owes the Conways two lives.

1010
01:22:56,805 --> 01:22:58,363
How's he doin'?

1011
01:22:58,473 --> 01:23:01,408
Just hurry, okay?

1012
01:23:01,509 --> 01:23:03,943
Stay with me, Josh.
Stay with me.

1013
01:23:13,488 --> 01:23:15,649
- Careful.
- Yeah.

1014
01:23:37,612 --> 01:23:40,012
Someone's coming!

1015
01:23:41,449 --> 01:23:43,542
Hold it!

1016
01:23:45,587 --> 01:23:48,818
- Josh?
- He'll be all right, Megan.

1017
01:23:51,259 --> 01:23:52,920
Turn around.

1018
01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:14,712
Let him go.

1019
01:24:15,950 --> 01:24:18,976
Don't count on
another chance, Conway.

1020
01:24:22,657 --> 01:24:24,056
Come here.

1021
01:24:33,001 --> 01:24:34,298
Sophie.

1022
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:40,874
- Come with me.
- I can't.

1023
01:24:40,975 --> 01:24:43,910
You're gonna be 100 soon.
What better reason than that?

1024
01:24:44,012 --> 01:24:47,846
I have four years left,
and I belong here.

1025
01:24:47,949 --> 01:24:50,144
I don't want to leave without you.

1026
01:24:50,251 --> 01:24:53,778
I'm as much a part of Springville
as it's a part of me.

1027
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:56,550
I only exist like this here.

1028
01:24:58,393 --> 01:25:03,194
I never thought I'd love again, Dennis,
and I have you to thank for that.

1029
01:25:03,298 --> 01:25:07,234
Okay, go. Go and live
the way nature intended.

1030
01:25:08,903 --> 01:25:10,336
I'll never forget you.

1031
01:25:19,414 --> 01:25:21,678
- Good-bye, Nick.
- Bye.

1032
01:25:32,727 --> 01:25:35,059
Are you gonna hunt them down?

1033
01:25:39,734 --> 01:25:41,634
No, I won't.

1034
01:25:51,546 --> 01:25:54,515
[Nick]
Even if I wanted to tell,
nobody will believe me.

1035
01:25:54,616 --> 01:25:56,345
[Dennis]
There's gonna come a day, Nick...

1036
01:25:56,451 --> 01:25:58,919
when it's gonna seem harmless to
tell somebody you want to impress...

1037
01:25:59,020 --> 01:26:04,083
like a girlfriend, your best buddy,
about this special place you know about.

1038
01:26:04,192 --> 01:26:07,855
So you let it slip.
But I'll tell you...

1039
01:26:07,962 --> 01:26:10,795
if our secret ever gets out, it's over.

1040
01:26:10,899 --> 01:26:14,460
I don't think Springville could handle
many more people like us.

1041
01:26:14,569 --> 01:26:17,333
I don't ever want
to go back there, Dad.

1042
01:26:17,438 --> 01:26:19,497
- Ever.
- All right.

1043
01:26:19,607 --> 01:26:21,472
I'm gonna ask you again
in about 40 years.

1044
01:26:21,576 --> 01:26:25,672
Fine. Unless you were sick.

1045
01:26:25,780 --> 01:26:27,645
If I were sick, you'd take me back?

1046
01:26:27,749 --> 01:26:29,080
Yeah.

1047
01:26:29,184 --> 01:26:32,585
Well, I think that's a decision
I should make, don't you?

1048
01:26:32,687 --> 01:26:34,621
I don't want people dying
until I'm ready.

1049
01:26:34,722 --> 01:26:39,125
If you want to play God,
I don't think the position's open.

1050
01:26:41,829 --> 01:26:44,127
Dad, what's it like to be 35?

1051
01:26:47,635 --> 01:26:49,102
You'll see.

1052
01:26:54,042 --> 01:26:55,600
You'll see.

1053
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:25,000
