00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:09,668
Look, just follow my lead, all right?
Let me do the talking.

177
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:12,838
You know, it's not working.

178
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:14,907
What? Fine.

179
00:16:14,908 --> 00:16:17,741
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

180
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:24,982
DAN: He he, you scared her.

181
00:16:31,257 --> 00:16:32,557
Can I help you folks?

182
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:34,693
Yes, sir. Do you have
a phone we can use?

183
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:35,727
Everything all right?

184
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:39,796
Someone stole our car. We need
to get ahold of the police.

185
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:44,803
All right. Nancy?

186
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:46,405
Come on in.

187
00:16:46,406 --> 00:16:50,774
Watch your step.
It's hot out there. Come on in.

188
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:54,244
My home is yours.

189
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,455
- If you'll excuse me.
- Oops, sorry.

190
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:06,825
So, telephone is right over here,
and the sheriff's phone number

191
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:08,927
- is right on the handset.
- Great, thanks.

192
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:10,229
Nancy, Honey.

193
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:13,265
- NANCY: Coming.
- Uh-hm.

194
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:16,218
- Sorry I got spooked like I did.
- Oh, sorry about that.

195
00:17:16,219 --> 00:17:18,437
We weren't trying to startle you.

196
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:22,708
That's all right, Hon. Why don't you
kids sit down here at the table?

197
00:17:24,344 --> 00:17:27,012
Yeah, Nancy, she's scared of
her own shadow sometimes.

198
00:17:27,013 --> 00:17:29,281
That's probably why she ran away.

199
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:33,285
So what brings you around?

200
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:36,321
Well, we were stopped to
look at the Elvis rock...

201
00:17:36,322 --> 00:17:40,058
And the next thing we knew we were
watching our car drive off without us.

202
00:17:40,827 --> 00:17:42,628
Oh, that's a shame.

203
00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:47,564
- Where, where exactly are we?
- You're in Spaulding, Hon.

204
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:51,470
Oh, you're not going
to find that there.

205
00:17:51,471 --> 00:17:54,006
We really ought to talk
to Jed about this.

206
00:17:54,007 --> 00:17:57,376
You know, yours is about the fifth
car that's been stolen this month.

207
00:17:57,377 --> 00:18:00,011
- Really?
- DAN: Seriously?

208
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:06,652
You know, it's that damn rock. I keep
telling them to change the signs.

209
00:18:06,653 --> 00:18:10,022
You know, take them down,
get rid of them, but...

210
00:18:10,023 --> 00:18:13,392
Besides, it don't look
anything like Elvis.

211
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:14,393
(LAUGHTER)

212
00:18:14,394 --> 00:18:17,396
- At all!
- Not at all.

213
00:18:17,397 --> 00:18:21,566
On that note, I actually
think it looks a lot like me. Huh?

214
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,634
- Well, lookee there.
- I'll be.

215
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:24,736
(CHUCKLES)

216
00:18:24,737 --> 00:18:28,407
Don't encourage him!

217
00:18:28,408 --> 00:18:30,442
It's got your nose.

218
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:31,476
Thanks for the phone.

219
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:32,811
- Sure thing.
- Sheriff's on his way.

220
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:34,846
MAGGIE: Oh, great, thank you.

221
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:38,617
Good. You poor kids must be starving.

222
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,686
Tell you what. Why don't
you go in the living room...

223
00:18:40,687 --> 00:18:44,488
and make yourself at home,
and I'll fix us up some supper.

224
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:48,560
(ALL TOGETHER) Uh, Um.

225
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:51,063
Honey, why don't you make
your famous spaghetti?

226
00:18:51,064 --> 00:18:55,567
Oh, that's a great idea.
What do you say?

227
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:57,836
- No, we couldn't.
- No. I...

228
00:18:57,837 --> 00:19:02,808
Oh, come on. I'd love to.
It's no trouble at all. Really.

229
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:06,511
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

230
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:09,381
HAROLD: Come on in the living room.
Nancy will fix us some supper.

231
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:11,315
Oh, boy.

232
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:16,453
Mm. You haven't tasted her spaghetti.
You're in for a treat.

233
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:32,771
So senior account manager?

234
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:34,806
Yeah.

235
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:35,841
What does that mean?

236
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:38,710
(CHUCKLES) I don't know.
Your guess is as good as mine.

237
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:41,079
(CHUCKLES) Okay.

238
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,514
- Where are you kids heading?
- Oh, every year we visit our parents...

239
00:19:44,515 --> 00:19:47,586
for their wedding anniversary
up in Pennsylvania.

240
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:49,454
We usually fly, but this year,

241
00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:53,959
my incredible husband decided
he wanted to take a road trip.

242
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,762
What? Oh, come on.
Who doesn't love a road trip?

243
00:19:56,763 --> 00:19:57,963
(ALL TOGETHER) Uh, us!

244
00:19:57,964 --> 00:20:00,999
(CHUCKLES)

245
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,667
Well, I do.

246
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:06,103
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

247
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:08,972
Well, that'd be Jed.

248
00:20:10,977 --> 00:20:12,943
Excuse me.

249
00:20:18,484 --> 00:20:21,120
- This is wonderful.
- Uh-hm.

250
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:24,856
- Sheriff.
- Harold.

251
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:28,592
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

252
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:37,468
Hey, folks. This here is Jed.
He's our town sheriff.

253
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:40,705
- Hi, Jed.
- Hey, Nancy.

254
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:43,974
- Thanks for coming to meet us, sheriff.
- My pleasure.

255
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:48,460
Now...

256
00:20:48,486 --> 00:20:53,118
on the phone you said you think someone
stole your car out by the old Elvis rock?

257
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,587
Uh, no, we don't think anything.

258
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:58,190
We saw somebody break
into the car and steal it.

259
00:20:58,191 --> 00:21:01,193
Did you get a good look at him?

260
00:21:01,194 --> 00:21:04,529
No, we were pretty far away.

261
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:08,800
Well, the kids in the next town over often
think it's funny to come into my town...

262
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:13,171
and steal our cars. They think
they can get away with it, too.

263
00:21:13,172 --> 00:21:15,040
I'd bet your car is over there.

264
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,608
- Hm.
- Really?

265
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:20,577
- MAGGIE: That's good, right?
- Well, good. Let's go get it then.

266
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:25,217
But I mean, we need to
get the car now, right?

267
00:21:25,218 --> 00:21:29,553
Let's not get all puffed up now.
Let me handle your car.

268
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,627
Yeah, uh, okay. Um...

269
00:21:38,528 --> 00:21:41,066
How long is that going to take?

270
00:21:41,267 --> 00:21:44,269
One, maybe two days.

271

(SIGHS)

272
00:21:46,739 --> 00:21:48,273
Okay.

273
00:21:48,274 --> 00:21:52,575
- Do you folks have a place to stay?
- No, we don't.

274
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,281
Where's the closest
motel around here?

275
00:21:56,282 --> 00:21:59,718
Hm. Closest motel...

276
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:05,190
that would be about,
oh, 30 miles, I expect.

277
00:22:05,191 --> 00:22:09,294
Why don't you kids just stay with us?
We could put them up, right?

278
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:12,032
Well, uh,

279
00:22:13,633 --> 00:22:14,866
I don't see why not.

280
00:22:14,867 --> 00:22:18,637
- No, we couldn't possibly.
- Yeah, but thanks for offering.

281
00:22:18,638 --> 00:22:19,905
We insist.

282
00:22:19,906 --> 00:22:23,975
Thank you, Harold, Nancy.
That is very kind of you.

283
00:22:23,976 --> 00:22:25,577
It's our pleasure.

284
00:22:25,578 --> 00:22:29,549
Well, I better get going.

285
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:32,017
And don't worry, we'll find your car.

286
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:33,652
- (SIGHS)
- Yeah.

287
00:22:33,653 --> 00:22:36,319
Let me walk you out.

288
00:22:37,256 --> 00:22:39,658
Excuse me.

289
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:43,226
Thanks a ton, Sheriff. Appreciate it.

290
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:50,199
Eat up. After dinner,
I'll walk you down to your rooms.

291
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:04,581
Think we need the light?

292
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:12,657
- Love you.
- LUKE: Love you, too.

293

(SAW DRILLING)

294
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:33,144
I'm sure they'll find those
kids that swiped your car.

295
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:34,778
Good.

296
00:23:36,983 --> 00:23:38,984
DAN: Did anybody else hear
that sound last night?

297
00:23:38,985 --> 00:23:40,018
- What sound?
- I don't know.

298
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:41,853
It sounded like a saw or something.

299
00:23:41,854 --> 00:23:45,822
Oh, that's just Jimmy.
He's always working out in the shed.

300
00:23:49,295 --> 00:23:50,845
Where's Harold?

301
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,798
He went out early this morning with the
sheriff. They went out looking for your car.

302
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:55,900
He thinks they might have
found it in the next town over.

303
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:57,702
Oh, that's great.

304
00:23:57,703 --> 00:23:59,836
Oh, thank God. That's great.

305
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:04,743
- How do you kids like your food?
- Oh, it's delicious.

306
00:24:04,744 --> 00:24:06,643
You're quite the chef.

307
00:24:08,014 --> 00:24:09,679
Thank you.

308
00:24:20,893 --> 00:24:23,460
- Seriously?
- DAN: Come on, Dude.

309
00:24:30,703 --> 00:24:34,172
- This is terrible.
- Why are you reading it?

310
00:24:34,173 --> 00:24:36,974
It's not like there's
anything else to do.

311
00:24:38,377 --> 00:24:40,847
Oh, yeah, bitch.

00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:47,417
Nice throw, Manning.

314
00:24:48,387 --> 00:24:49,754
Sorry.

315
00:24:49,755 --> 00:24:52,021
Where'd you find this guy?

316
00:24:55,428 --> 00:24:57,894
What are we going to do now?

317
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:13,743
What?

318
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:17,714
Damned Elvis rock.

319
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:21,786
I know. Just don't focus on it.

320
00:25:21,787 --> 00:25:24,354
Yeah, I'm trying.

321
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:30,228
Oh. Hey, let's go to that gift store.

322
00:25:30,229 --> 00:25:33,031
Why? So we can get a
souvenir of this town?

323
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:34,032
Yeah.

324
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:37,869
- Uh, no thank you.
- (CHUCKLES) Come on!

325
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:41,984
Hey guys, hey guys. We're going to
go to this gift store over here.

A four-wheeler and a pink bike.

327

Oh, that's what we need.
Maybe that'll get us home.

328
00:26:02,194 --> 00:26:03,295
Hey, you know what?

329
00:26:03,296 --> 00:26:07,300
I'm going to go check in with the sheriff
and see if he's had any luck with the car.

330
00:26:08,501 --> 00:26:10,902
Well could you at least
try to get along with Dan?

Look, Mags, I've seen enough
weird stuff on this trip.

Damn it, Luke. I'm serious.

as well get used to it.

Fine. Look...

335
00:26:22,548 --> 00:26:26,017
Can we just check in with the sheriff
first and then we can meet up with them?

336
00:26:26,018 --> 00:26:28,652
- Fine.
- Okay.
