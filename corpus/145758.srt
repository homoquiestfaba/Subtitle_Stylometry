1
00:00:46,654 --> 00:00:48,485
Come on.

2
00:00:48,556 --> 00:00:50,990
Do it, chicken.

3
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:53,526
Do it.

4
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:02,600
Go on. Do it.

5
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,434
Go on. Hurry up.

6
00:01:13,514 --> 00:01:15,607
Are you chicken, or what?

7
00:01:27,395 --> 00:01:28,919
Look out!

8
00:02:02,897 --> 00:02:05,491
Kid?

9
00:02:05,566 --> 00:02:06,999
Hey, kid.

10
00:02:20,415 --> 00:02:22,679
What happened?

11
00:02:27,155 --> 00:02:29,521
Help! Somebody help!

12
00:02:46,407 --> 00:02:48,500
Hold on, now.
You're gonna be all right.

13
00:02:49,644 --> 00:02:52,579
Almost there.
Come on !

14
00:02:56,851 --> 00:02:59,319
- Hello, is this the emergency room?
- Yes, sir.

15
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:01,981
- I'm bringing a child in.
- What is your emergency?

16
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:04,524
I don't know!
I'm bringing a child in !

17
00:03:04,592 --> 00:03:06,992
Can you tell me the nature
of your emergency?

18
00:03:07,929 --> 00:03:09,863
Help!

19
00:03:10,932 --> 00:03:12,365
Help him!

20
00:03:13,701 --> 00:03:16,033
- Let's get a cold package, stat!
- Let me have the boy!

21
00:03:17,271 --> 00:03:21,264
To the burn unit!
It's okay now, sir.

22
00:03:21,342 --> 00:03:24,778
Put him in ER 8.
Sir, you have to stay with me now.

23
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,872
- Are you the boy's father?
- No.

24
00:03:30,618 --> 00:03:32,313
He was just--

25
00:03:32,386 --> 00:03:35,685
He was walking down
the middle of the road.

26
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:38,021
Have you seen him before?
What's his name?

27
00:03:39,694 --> 00:03:43,061
- Sir, please. It's important.
- What? What?

28
00:03:43,131 --> 00:03:47,295
- The boy's name!
- I don't know his name!

29
00:06:02,536 --> 00:06:05,528
Excuse me, Mr. Faraday?

30
00:06:05,606 --> 00:06:06,937
Yeah?

31
00:06:07,008 --> 00:06:08,942
We're Brady's parents.

32
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:14,806
You feel like they're old enough.

33
00:06:14,882 --> 00:06:17,646
- They should be able to--
- Can't let them out of your sight.

34
00:06:17,718 --> 00:06:20,448
I mean, he said he was going
to the park to play.

35
00:06:20,521 --> 00:06:23,285
He didn't want us to know
what he was doing.

36
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,761
Michael, we can't thank you enough.
It you hadn't come along when you did--

37
00:06:28,829 --> 00:06:31,127
No, I'm just glad we made it.

38
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,900
So, uh...

39
00:06:36,971 --> 00:06:38,438
what, uh--

40
00:06:38,506 --> 00:06:41,942
He and his friends got together
all their fireworks--

41
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:46,105
their cones and their candles--
and they tied them up together.

42
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:49,308
They were trying to blast
some kind of super rocket in the park.

43
00:06:49,383 --> 00:06:51,510
And Brady's the one who--

44
00:06:51,585 --> 00:06:54,247
He must've been the one
that set it oft.

45
00:06:54,322 --> 00:06:56,916
The other kids must've
put him up to it.

46
00:07:00,895 --> 00:07:03,659
And it was just starting
to feel like home too.

47
00:07:03,731 --> 00:07:06,199
I thought that to myself today.

48
00:07:06,267 --> 00:07:09,634
Just thought it's starting
to feel like home.

49
00:07:14,008 --> 00:07:16,340
He's gonna be okay.

50
00:07:18,212 --> 00:07:20,407
He's gonna be all right.

51
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,508
Thank you, Michael.

52
00:07:26,687 --> 00:07:28,621
Unit 14, clear.

53
00:07:30,091 --> 00:07:31,615
Oh, God.

54
00:07:31,692 --> 00:07:35,389
It's gotta be hell
they're going through.

55
00:07:35,463 --> 00:07:39,991
Two months they've lived there.
I haven't said one word to 'em.

56
00:07:41,635 --> 00:07:44,365
Well, you can't be
best friends with everybody.

57
00:07:44,438 --> 00:07:48,602
I watch them fixin' up their house,
their kids playin' in their yard.

58
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:52,772
I held their son in my arms
hangin' on for his life tonight.

59
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,338
Kid lives right across the street.

60
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:57,543
I didn't even know his name.

61
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:20,033
Did he die?

62
00:08:22,109 --> 00:08:26,205
No, he's gonna be in the hospital
for a while, but he'll be tine.

63
00:08:27,214 --> 00:08:30,547
I saw the blood in the street.

64
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,821
He's gonna be okay, Grant.

65
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:41,225
Brooke said that she made you
some dinner. You're not hungry?

66
00:08:47,601 --> 00:08:49,865
Want me to fix you something?

67
00:08:53,274 --> 00:08:54,707
Grant?

68
00:08:57,344 --> 00:09:02,213
- She gonna stay here every night?
- No, not every night.

69
00:09:04,852 --> 00:09:07,412
She stayed last night
because I asked her.

70
00:09:07,488 --> 00:09:10,548
We talked about Brooke.
You said you liked her.

71
00:09:10,624 --> 00:09:13,252
I liked her better before.

72
00:09:15,162 --> 00:09:16,595
Yeah, well...

73
00:09:20,134 --> 00:09:22,193
try to get some sleep, okay?

74
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:33,039
Love you.

75
00:09:51,932 --> 00:09:54,594
The name of this course
is American Terrorism.

76
00:09:55,503 --> 00:09:58,904
Two hundred years ago, we fought
a revolution over certain beliefs--

77
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:04,275
Liberty, justice for all,
self-rule and self- reliance.

78
00:10:04,345 --> 00:10:08,076
There are many in this country
who feel we have not yet won that war.

79
00:10:09,049 --> 00:10:11,847
Terrorist acts,
violent political theater--

80
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:15,184
These have been a part of social dissent
in this country since its inception.

81
00:10:15,256 --> 00:10:19,090
But why?
Why here in this land of freedom?

82
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,186
What's led men to such bloodshed...

83
00:10:22,263 --> 00:10:24,424
in the name of their beliefs?

84
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:27,023
Why in this era
of national prosperity...

85
00:10:27,101 --> 00:10:30,502
has the antigovernment movement
been at its peak?

86
00:10:30,571 --> 00:10:34,507
And what's that gonna mean
when the prosperity fades?

87
00:10:34,575 --> 00:10:37,203
Fewer and fewer of us are voting.

88
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:39,269
More and more of us are joining
the ranks of a resistance.

89
00:10:39,346 --> 00:10:43,146
How long are we gonna call
these numbers insignificant?

90
00:10:44,718 --> 00:10:47,949
What do they have to teach us?

91
00:11:06,774 --> 00:11:09,675
- I'm going to go explore.
- Okay.

92
00:11:21,088 --> 00:11:24,182
The only woman I ever liked havin'
around that was smarter than me.

93
00:11:24,258 --> 00:11:26,590
Whit Carver, generous to a fault.

94
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:35,029
Good day, Mr. Faraday.

95
00:11:35,102 --> 00:11:37,730
- How's he doin'?
- He's all right.

96
00:11:37,805 --> 00:11:40,433
We're still seeing his counselor.

97
00:11:40,507 --> 00:11:43,101
She says he's improving,
but he still keeps to himself a lot.

98
00:11:44,945 --> 00:11:46,879
How's his dad doin'?

99
00:11:48,282 --> 00:11:50,182
He's all right.

100
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,617
Still seeing his graduate student?

101
00:11:54,555 --> 00:11:56,921
Yeah. She says
he's improving, but--

102
00:11:56,991 --> 00:11:59,960
He still keeps to himself
a lot, huh?

103
00:12:02,463 --> 00:12:04,693
This kid they got me
partnered with...

104
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:09,725
is a walking, laptop computer,
cyberspace geek.

105
00:12:09,803 --> 00:12:13,068
Put him across from some real bad guys,
it's like he's surprised to see 'em.

106
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,541
- I ought to make him take your course.
- Really?

107
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,840
- Teachin' it again?
- Oh, yeah.

108
00:12:20,547 --> 00:12:23,141
She'd like that.
I know what that would mean to her.

109
00:12:23,217 --> 00:12:27,153
The invitation's still good
for you to come by as a guest.

110
00:12:30,391 --> 00:12:32,882
I'd rather not stand trial
in front of you.

111
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:37,795
- That's not what it would be.
- Yeah, right. I know what it would be.

112
00:12:41,702 --> 00:12:43,067
How's work?

113
00:12:44,204 --> 00:12:45,933
You know, we're a team.

114
00:12:49,209 --> 00:12:52,303
That's what I miss, you know?

115
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:55,507
Conversations about work.
I'd tell her all about my day.

116
00:12:55,582 --> 00:12:58,016
She couldn't tell me
a goddamn thing.

117
00:12:59,853 --> 00:13:02,287
You wouldn't think I'd miss that,
but I do.

118
00:13:02,356 --> 00:13:05,792
Have me over to dinner sometime.
I'll keep some state secrets from you.

119
00:13:05,859 --> 00:13:08,987
- It'll be like she never left.
- People remember her, Whit?

120
00:13:11,031 --> 00:13:13,261
- What do you mean?
- At the Bureau.

121
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:16,667
Do they remember,
or do people forget?

122
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:24,007
They remember her, Michael.
They do.

123
00:13:28,482 --> 00:13:30,950
Leah died for her country.

124
00:13:32,953 --> 00:13:35,387
She shouldn't have.

125
00:13:43,897 --> 00:13:47,628
Michael, hello! How are you doing?
Our other guest of honor. Come in.

126
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:50,261
- Hope we're not late.
- No. Oliver, Michael's here.

127
00:13:50,337 --> 00:13:52,498
- Cheryl, this is Brooke.
- Hi, it's nice to meet you.

128
00:13:52,573 --> 00:13:54,939
It's really nice to meet you too.

129
00:13:55,008 --> 00:13:58,671
And this must be Grant.
How are you doing?

130
00:13:58,746 --> 00:14:03,206
There's junk food in the kitchen that's
just for kids and not for grownups.

131
00:14:03,283 --> 00:14:07,151
- Come on in.
- Let me introduce you to some friends.

132
00:14:09,022 --> 00:14:11,957
- Hot dog, please.
- Brady's looking great.

133
00:14:12,025 --> 00:14:15,392
Yeah, so would you it you found a way
to get out of school for a while.

134
00:14:15,462 --> 00:14:20,058
You're right, I would.
I teach at G.W.-- American history.

135
00:14:21,468 --> 00:14:23,993
I was always bad in history.

136
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:27,438
- Condemned to repeat it?
- Yeah, several times.

137
00:14:28,942 --> 00:14:31,934
So, what kind of work do you do?

138
00:14:32,012 --> 00:14:36,210
I'm a structural engineer.
You know the Reston Mall?

139
00:14:36,283 --> 00:14:39,980
- Oh, yeah.
- We're redesigning the addition.

140
00:14:40,053 --> 00:14:43,853
You want bigger storage, more parking?
I'm the guy to ask.

141
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:47,121
He knows. I'm not sure he totally
understands what happened.

142
00:14:47,194 --> 00:14:49,594
You know Michael from--

143
00:14:49,663 --> 00:14:53,690
I was Michael's teaching assistant
in my first year of grad school.

144
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:56,099
There was nothing between us.

145
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:59,435
I knew his family.
I knew Leah.

146
00:15:00,207 --> 00:15:02,641
I mean, this thing,
this is kind of--

147
00:15:04,678 --> 00:15:06,737
kind of new between us.

148
00:15:06,814 --> 00:15:07,872
Wow.

149
00:15:09,683 --> 00:15:13,084
You're so sweet together.

150
00:15:13,153 --> 00:15:15,519
Of course,
I think the world of him.

151
00:15:15,589 --> 00:15:19,389
He's such a good man.

152
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,394
Such a good father.

153
00:15:30,938 --> 00:15:33,133
The job was just
too appealing to pass up.

154
00:15:33,207 --> 00:15:35,801
Contracts were down
all over St. Louis.

155
00:15:35,876 --> 00:15:39,869
- How long were you in St. Louis?
- Four years, thereabouts.

156
00:15:39,947 --> 00:15:43,474
I grew up on a farm
in a place called Carson, Kansas.

157
00:15:44,551 --> 00:15:46,985
Never lived East before.

158
00:15:47,054 --> 00:15:49,215
Kids'll get to see
their first ocean.

159
00:15:49,289 --> 00:15:52,053
Yeah, I'm afraid
downtown's falling apart.

160
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:56,425
That's what I hear. I guess we're
not in Kansas anymore, eh, Toto?

161
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:57,589
Hannah.

162
00:15:58,665 --> 00:16:00,098
Bedtime.

163
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,964
- Be careful of his hand!
- I haven't even got two hands!

164
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:13,745
It's been a long time since
I've seen him just bein' a kid.

165
00:16:13,814 --> 00:16:15,611
Sometimes he's--

166
00:16:15,682 --> 00:16:18,116
You know, since his mother--

167
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,387
He has a tough time
making friends sometimes.

168
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,918
Well...

169
00:16:27,995 --> 00:16:30,691
Lucky we all need friends.

170
00:16:30,764 --> 00:16:33,062
Life just isn't the same
without 'em.

171
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,773
Let me take this in. Dad?

172
00:16:48,849 --> 00:16:52,546
- Yeah?
- How do you spell "restricted"?

173
00:16:53,921 --> 00:16:56,822
Restricted. R-E-S-T-R-l--

174
00:16:57,624 --> 00:17:01,219
You know how to use the dictionary.
What are you guys doin' in there?

175
00:17:01,295 --> 00:17:03,320
Building a compound.

176
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,957
- Compound?
- Soldiers' compound.

177
00:17:08,302 --> 00:17:09,667
Stop, Dad.

178
00:17:09,736 --> 00:17:12,330
You have to know
the secret handshake.

179
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,340
Should we tell him?

180
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:18,978
All right. Well...

181
00:17:19,046 --> 00:17:23,210
just so I know you're not gonna
use any fireworks in there, Brady.

182
00:17:23,283 --> 00:17:25,217
General Brady, Dad.

183
00:17:25,285 --> 00:17:28,721
Yeah?
No fireworks, General Brady.

184
00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:32,748
That's classified information.
You don't know the secret handshake.

185
00:17:32,826 --> 00:17:35,886
- I'm serious, Brady.
- Come on, Grant.

186
00:17:37,497 --> 00:17:40,091
Get washed up, guys.
We're gonna get dinner on.

187
00:17:56,149 --> 00:17:59,312
- Come on in.
- Got something for you in my mailbox.

188
00:17:59,386 --> 00:18:00,819
What's that?

189
00:18:01,822 --> 00:18:04,052
"University of Pennsylvania"?

190
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:06,684
-I thought you hadn't lived East before.
-I haven't.

191
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:10,719
I went to Kansas State, class of '78.
Must have me mixed up with someone else.

192
00:18:10,797 --> 00:18:14,665
- Same class, huh?
- Yeah, but at K State.

193
00:18:14,735 --> 00:18:17,033
It's a reunion.

194
00:18:17,104 --> 00:18:19,971
Must've lost track of some guy,
sent it to me instead.

195
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,168
Sorry about the mess. Cheryl and the
girls are at a church group tonight.

196
00:18:23,243 --> 00:18:25,268
I'm trying to catch up
on a little work.

197
00:18:25,345 --> 00:18:27,404
- How are ya?
- Good.

198
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,574
- How's Grant?
- He's doin' great.

199
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:33,081
Excuse me a minute. Hello?

200
00:18:39,226 --> 00:18:41,626
Why don't I call you back?

201
00:18:43,397 --> 00:18:45,331
What do you mean?

202
00:18:46,466 --> 00:18:47,899
Okay.

203
00:18:50,303 --> 00:18:53,363
Well, we should really talk
in person about this.

204
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,873
Yeah.

205
00:18:57,978 --> 00:19:00,003
I could work on this tonight.

206
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,911
Okay. All right.

207
00:19:01,982 --> 00:19:03,950
Listen, hold on a second.

208
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:08,044
This project is taking forever.
Client can't seem to make up his mind.

209
00:19:08,121 --> 00:19:11,215
- This the Reston Mall?
- Yeah. We're getting it on track.

210
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:13,384
I'm sorry, I have to--

211
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,293
- We'll see each other this weekend.
- Yes, the Junior Ds.

212
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:20,094
- Brady keeps talking about it.
- Yeah, he's gonna love it.

213
00:19:20,167 --> 00:19:22,567
He's gonna make more friends
than he'll know what to do with.

214
00:19:22,636 --> 00:19:25,400
They do camp outs, trips.

215
00:19:25,472 --> 00:19:28,635
Give you the house to yourself...

216
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,643
every now and then.

217
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,804
You and Brooke, I mean.

218
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:36,175
- I thank you, neighbor.
- For what?

219
00:19:36,249 --> 00:19:38,342
For having
a ten-year-old next door.

220
00:19:44,658 --> 00:19:47,821
- What do you know about shopping malls?
- Huh?

221
00:19:47,894 --> 00:19:52,456
Shopping malls. I was over at
the Langs', talking with Oliver.

222
00:19:52,532 --> 00:19:57,469
He had this blueprint on his counter.
He said it was the Reston Mall.

223
00:19:57,537 --> 00:20:00,233
- That's what he's workin' on.
- Yeah, but it wasn't.

224
00:20:01,308 --> 00:20:03,435
- What do you mean?
- I looked.

225
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:07,344
It was a building.
It wasn't a mall.

226
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:10,178
- Right, it's an addition.
- No.

227
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:13,685
It was an office building.
It wasn't stores at all.

228
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:17,281
oh, so, it's some other project
that he's working on.

229
00:20:21,795 --> 00:20:24,457
Why would he tell me
it was a mall if it wasn't?

230
00:20:24,531 --> 00:20:26,465
Why would he lie?

231
00:20:28,235 --> 00:20:31,762
When you took engineering in college,
what kind of grades did you get?

232
00:20:31,838 --> 00:20:33,772
I didn't take engineering.

233
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:43,811
What I saw was an office building.

234
00:20:49,422 --> 00:20:50,616
Fourteen moths ago
on a Monday in January...

235
00:20:52,192 --> 00:20:55,252
over 60 federal employees
went to work like they always did...

236
00:20:55,328 --> 00:20:58,456
at the Roosevelt Federal Building
in downtown St. Louis.

237
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,260
Except on that Monday
they didn't come home.

238
00:21:03,336 --> 00:21:05,827
In a truck parked in front...

239
00:21:05,906 --> 00:21:10,639
was hidden 50 pounds
of C-4 plastic explosive.

240
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:14,510
When it was detonated, it disintegrated
the street side of the building...

241
00:21:14,581 --> 00:21:18,176
obliterating dozens
of government offices...

242
00:21:18,251 --> 00:21:20,776
the building's day care center...

243
00:21:21,688 --> 00:21:24,953
and the St. Louis branch
of the Internal Revenue Service...

244
00:21:25,025 --> 00:21:28,426
which was ultimately determined
to be the target of the attack.

245
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:33,194
The truck was leased by
this 33-year-old electrician...

246
00:21:34,634 --> 00:21:36,124
Dean Scobee.

247
00:21:36,903 --> 00:21:40,964
Scobee had served some prison time
for tax evasion...

248
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:45,102
and surveillance videos showed
that he was inside the vehicle...

249
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:47,510
Leaving him among the 63 dead.

250
00:21:47,581 --> 00:21:50,141
Does anyone not remember this?

251
00:21:51,918 --> 00:21:53,943
You all remember the results
of the investigation?

252
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:57,820
- They said Scobee acted alone.
- One man, no conspirators.

253
00:21:58,892 --> 00:22:00,689
Right?

254
00:22:01,494 --> 00:22:05,590
He cheated the IRS. They caught
him at it, so he blew 'em up.

255
00:22:08,268 --> 00:22:12,500
This is a guy who people
described as average.

256
00:22:12,572 --> 00:22:14,005
Friendly.

257
00:22:15,342 --> 00:22:18,573
He'd been in the army,
but as a radio man.

258
00:22:18,645 --> 00:22:21,341
He had very little experience
with munitions.

259
00:22:21,414 --> 00:22:25,544
His parents considered him
a moderate conservative.

260
00:22:25,619 --> 00:22:31,353
Two weeks prior to this, he received
a pay raise at his electrician's job.

261
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:35,360
Does that sound like a man who's
on the edge or a man who needed a push?

262
00:22:35,428 --> 00:22:37,225
Huh?

263
00:22:37,297 --> 00:22:39,663
Come on. I don't know.
I'm just asking.

264
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:43,669
Come on, Professor.
The Feds did this huge investigation.

265
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:46,035
That's right,
an investigation, I forgot.

266
00:22:46,106 --> 00:22:48,233
Well...

267
00:22:48,308 --> 00:22:51,243
the investigation
didn't satisfy me.

268
00:22:53,213 --> 00:22:55,841
Miss O'Neill,
when you first heard the news--

269
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:59,875
terrorist attack in your own country--
how did that make you feel?

270
00:22:59,953 --> 00:23:01,545
- Come on.
- Well--

271
00:23:02,622 --> 00:23:05,648
What did you feel?

272
00:23:05,725 --> 00:23:07,158
Angry.

273
00:23:08,228 --> 00:23:10,287
Scared and stressed.

274
00:23:10,363 --> 00:23:12,923
- Did you feel safe?
- No.

275
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,369
And then the next day,
when they found Scobee dead...

276
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:20,633
did you feel some relief?

277
00:23:20,707 --> 00:23:22,641
Did safety return?

278
00:23:35,355 --> 00:23:38,051
The people in that building,
they felt safe...

279
00:23:39,693 --> 00:23:44,426
secure, just like you feel now.

280
00:23:46,866 --> 00:23:49,664
And then an instant later--

281
00:23:51,604 --> 00:23:53,538
In an instant...

282
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:59,645
they were gone forever.

283
00:24:06,686 --> 00:24:10,213
We needed to have
this man to blame.

284
00:24:14,194 --> 00:24:16,424
We don't want others.

285
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:18,691
We want one name...

286
00:24:18,765 --> 00:24:20,858
and we want it fast...

287
00:24:20,934 --> 00:24:24,700
because it gives us
our security back.

288
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:30,404
We can say,
"Here was the one man...

289
00:24:30,477 --> 00:24:32,570
unlike the rest of us.

290
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:37,509
We named him,
and he's no more.

291
00:24:37,584 --> 00:24:40,212
And his reasons,
they're gone too."

292
00:24:40,286 --> 00:24:43,312
But the truth is,
we don't know his reasons.

293
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:46,154
We don't know why Scobee did it,
why it came to this.

294
00:24:46,226 --> 00:24:49,161
We can pretend we do--
the ten grand in taxes--

295
00:24:49,229 --> 00:24:51,163
but we don't know...

296
00:24:52,232 --> 00:24:54,166
and we'll never know.

297
00:24:57,170 --> 00:25:01,072
And still, we feel sate...

298
00:25:04,778 --> 00:25:07,246
because we know his name.

299
00:25:08,648 --> 00:25:11,742
As God is my witness...

300
00:25:11,818 --> 00:25:14,480
I promise to give...

301
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:16,488
friendship to those in need.

302
00:25:18,658 --> 00:25:20,649
Help to those in trouble.

303
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:25,159
I will work with faith and honor...

304
00:25:27,167 --> 00:25:29,397
to uphold the Discoverer code.

305
00:25:32,138 --> 00:25:34,436
To respect myself...

306
00:25:35,308 --> 00:25:37,242
my family...

307
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:39,244
and my country.

308
00:25:40,346 --> 00:25:43,873
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
Junior Discovery Troop 474.

309
00:25:59,466 --> 00:26:01,559
This is Oliver's study...

310
00:26:01,634 --> 00:26:03,864
where he, you know,
gets away from the kids...

311
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,871
and me, I suppose.

312
00:26:07,474 --> 00:26:10,204
These are all projects
you've worked on?

313
00:26:10,276 --> 00:26:12,608
I wish.
No, I collect sketches...

314
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:15,239
blueprints,
designs of old buildings.

315
00:26:15,315 --> 00:26:17,545
This is a front view of Monticello.

316
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:20,051
- Down there is the Woolworth Building.
- It's his hobby.

317
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,112
- The St. Louis Arch.
- Yes, correct.

318
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:26,882
So, then all of these drawings,
these buildings...

319
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,894
they're not just
for your job, then?

320
00:26:30,497 --> 00:26:32,624
Oh. So they're not
all shopping malls.

321
00:26:32,699 --> 00:26:37,033
No, I don't know of any architecturally
significant shopping malls.

322
00:26:37,103 --> 00:26:40,072
Oh, honey, you just
haven't built them yet.

323
00:26:43,276 --> 00:26:45,244
- Who's hungry?
- I'm famished.

324
00:26:45,311 --> 00:26:49,680
Come on. I've got some
really delicious putt pastry.

325
00:26:52,418 --> 00:26:54,511
They've got to work so hard
when they're there.

326
00:26:54,587 --> 00:26:57,112
You've gotta keep 'em
in the seats.

327
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:58,623
You know?

328
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:02,727
Politically, there's something
to be said for that.

329
00:27:02,795 --> 00:27:05,093
Yeah, it was a lot of fun.
Here we are leaving the church.

330
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:07,224
Everyone thought we were
going to Mexico.

331
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,268
- Where were you going?
- We were going there...

332
00:27:09,335 --> 00:27:11,895
but the plane
never left the ground.

333
00:27:11,971 --> 00:27:13,632
Some kind of engine trouble.

334
00:27:13,706 --> 00:27:18,643
Couldn't leave till morning, so we spent
the night at the Wichita Airport Motel.

335
00:27:18,711 --> 00:27:20,872
How romantic!

336
00:27:20,947 --> 00:27:24,508
- Well, for $19, it was wonderful.
- How long you two been married?

337
00:27:25,618 --> 00:27:29,281
- Well, 12 years in August.
- What kind of example is that?

338
00:27:30,356 --> 00:27:35,658
Well, I don't think we learn
responsibility from politicians.

339
00:27:35,728 --> 00:27:37,821
We really learn it from family.

340
00:27:37,897 --> 00:27:40,161
It's the people that we care about.

341
00:27:40,233 --> 00:27:43,862
- It's what they care about.
- He died when I was a teenager.

342
00:27:44,837 --> 00:27:46,634
Oh, I'm sorry.

343
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:48,139
Farm accident.

344
00:27:50,376 --> 00:27:53,004
-Where would you say you get yours from?
-My what? My values?

345
00:27:58,384 --> 00:28:01,080
- Probably from my wife.
- Values?

346
00:28:02,155 --> 00:28:04,180
What values?

347
00:28:04,257 --> 00:28:07,158
Michael and I were talking about
where you get your values from...

348
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:09,957
and we were both saying
it's mostly from family.

349
00:28:10,029 --> 00:28:13,726
Well, where else you gonna get 'em?
Celebrities? Politicians?

350
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,734
Not in this century.

351
00:28:18,004 --> 00:28:20,029
I just think it's...

352
00:28:20,106 --> 00:28:24,440
a sorry state of affairs when you can't
find a role model to cast your vote for.

353
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:26,944
It's not even role models,
necessarily.

354
00:28:27,013 --> 00:28:31,882
It's just people who acknowledge
the consequences of their actions.

355
00:28:31,951 --> 00:28:36,820
Or pay for those actions. I think we
should put some politicians in jail.

356
00:28:38,358 --> 00:28:41,418
You can't ask government
to be infallible.

357
00:28:41,494 --> 00:28:44,122
You just can't.
But you can ask it to be accountable.

358
00:28:46,899 --> 00:28:49,231
I can ask it to be honest.

359
00:28:49,302 --> 00:28:51,964
You know, when Leah died...

360
00:28:52,038 --> 00:28:55,235
all I wanted was someone...

361
00:28:55,308 --> 00:28:59,108
to tell me,
"We made a mistake."

362
00:28:59,178 --> 00:29:02,670
You know?
"We made a mistake.

363
00:29:02,749 --> 00:29:04,944
Your wife suffered for it...

364
00:29:06,019 --> 00:29:08,453
and we'd take it back
a hundred times if we could."

365
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:11,484
But, uh...

366
00:29:11,557 --> 00:29:13,957
they don't say that.

367
00:29:14,027 --> 00:29:15,460
She would've.

368
00:29:21,567 --> 00:29:24,331
Some of them knew her.

369
00:29:29,108 --> 00:29:32,635
They work so hard at being able
to look you in the eye.

370
00:29:51,931 --> 00:29:53,296
Excuse me.

371
00:30:07,146 --> 00:30:09,239
Leave him alone.
He's tine.

372
00:30:13,453 --> 00:30:14,886
Sorry.

373
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:25,862
- I see how much you miss her.
- There are just these times...

374
00:30:25,932 --> 00:30:29,834
when you realize how much
your own life is out of your hands.

375
00:30:33,272 --> 00:30:35,365
What are you gonna do?

376
00:30:39,312 --> 00:30:41,405
I guess you can have faith.

377
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:47,584
Try to make a difference
while you can with Grant...

378
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:51,323
to your classes.

379
00:30:55,928 --> 00:30:57,862
What about you?

380
00:31:00,767 --> 00:31:02,701
Got my family...

381
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:06,932
and the buildings I leave behind.

382
00:31:11,644 --> 00:31:13,578
That's it.

383
00:31:13,646 --> 00:31:15,978
Get your shoulder up
a little bit, okay?

384
00:31:16,048 --> 00:31:18,846
Step into it. Watch that ball
until it hits the bat.

385
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:20,852
That's it!

386
00:31:22,955 --> 00:31:25,048
You want some Crackerjack?

387
00:31:29,295 --> 00:31:33,789
You sure? Popcorn and caramel.
It builds your muscles.

388
00:31:33,866 --> 00:31:35,231
All right.

389
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:39,037
Hey, atta way, Faraday.

390
00:31:40,339 --> 00:31:44,537
- He's gettin' some confidence.
- He's a strong kid.

391
00:31:46,479 --> 00:31:49,846
- He's been dealt some hard breaks.
- Atta way to swing.

392
00:31:51,517 --> 00:31:55,112
- You give him strength.
- I'm tryin'.

393
00:31:55,188 --> 00:31:57,383
You do.

394
00:31:57,457 --> 00:32:00,255
Gettin' on with your life.
That's important for him to see.

395
00:32:02,895 --> 00:32:05,159
He just wishes someone had to pay.

396
00:32:06,265 --> 00:32:07,391
What?

397
00:32:08,768 --> 00:32:12,670
For his mother.
He wishes someone had to pay.

398
00:32:12,738 --> 00:32:14,831
He's talked to you about her?

399
00:32:16,242 --> 00:32:18,642
Our people send her in with
the wrong information then say...

400
00:32:18,711 --> 00:32:20,645
"Hey, not my fault."

401
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:25,143
I can't live with that...

402
00:32:25,218 --> 00:32:28,415
for you,
let alone a nine-year-old boy.

403
00:32:29,856 --> 00:32:32,484
Grant talked to you
about his mother?

404
00:32:34,594 --> 00:32:36,186
Well, yeah.

405
00:32:36,262 --> 00:32:39,663
I hope that's all right.
We talk about a lot of things.

406
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,325
He's a smart kid.

407
00:32:46,405 --> 00:32:48,930
Way to go, Grant.

408
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:53,504
We're never more wise
than when we're children.

409
00:32:53,579 --> 00:32:55,513
They say it, and it's true.

410
00:32:57,283 --> 00:32:59,751
We'll never see things
that clear again.

411
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:07,618
Let me have a hit.

412
00:33:19,672 --> 00:33:22,607
Come on, now, it's dinnertime.
Wash your hands.

413
00:33:22,675 --> 00:33:25,906
- I'm eating with Brady.
- No, come on, now.

414
00:33:26,846 --> 00:33:29,508
Michael, I'm sorry.
Brady invited him over for dinner.

415
00:33:29,582 --> 00:33:33,074
- I thought he'd asked you.
- Can I eat with Brady, Dad?

416
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:41,248
Okay, it his dad
says it's all right.

417
00:33:41,327 --> 00:33:43,420
Is it all right, kids?

418
00:33:46,832 --> 00:33:49,323
I can fly!

419
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:08,114
- Good afternoon, U Penn.
- Transcript office, please.

420
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:13,581
-Transcripts.
-I'm calling from Washington University.

421
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:17,493
We have a student who's applying for
graduate work in our history department.

422
00:34:17,563 --> 00:34:20,862
I need to verify his
undergrad record with you guys.

423
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:25,028
He's been out of school
for some time.

424
00:34:26,872 --> 00:34:28,806
The name's Oliver Lang.

425
00:34:29,976 --> 00:34:32,410
Are you telling me that you
took this out of his mailbox?

426
00:34:32,478 --> 00:34:35,003
- That is illegal.
- Tell me it you think this is strange.

427
00:34:35,081 --> 00:34:37,743
The University of Pennsylvania
keeps sending him alumni stuff...

428
00:34:37,817 --> 00:34:39,751
for a 20-year reunion.

429
00:34:39,819 --> 00:34:43,346
He says he went to Kansas State. They
have him mixed up with someone else.

430
00:34:43,422 --> 00:34:46,516
So I call Penn.
I get that guy's transcripts.

431
00:34:46,592 --> 00:34:50,187
- What? Why? Michael! Oh, my God!
- Listen to me.

432
00:34:50,262 --> 00:34:53,629
That guy has a completely
different physical description.

433
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:56,031
- He never took a class in engineering.
- Right...

434
00:34:56,102 --> 00:34:58,297
because they've got him mixed up
with somebody else.

435
00:34:58,371 --> 00:35:01,863
This U Penn Oliver
is the same age as Oliver.

436
00:35:01,941 --> 00:35:05,104
- Wait. As our Oliver?
- As our Oliver, yes.

437
00:35:05,177 --> 00:35:08,146
He graduated the same year, and...

438
00:35:08,214 --> 00:35:12,207
he comes from Carson, Kansas,
Oliver's hometown.

439
00:35:12,284 --> 00:35:15,549
Wait, I'm totally lost. You just said
that they're two different people.

440
00:35:15,621 --> 00:35:19,717
Yeah. Two people the same age
from the same small town!

441
00:35:19,792 --> 00:35:22,522
I looked it up.
It's a small town!

442
00:35:22,595 --> 00:35:24,893
Yeah, so what?

443
00:35:24,964 --> 00:35:27,524
Brooke, don't you think they would've
heard of each other, these guys?

444
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,228
You know, growing up?
Gotten mixed up before?

445
00:35:30,302 --> 00:35:33,465
Oliver didn't say anything like that.
He just threw the letter away.

446
00:35:33,539 --> 00:35:35,473
- Well, wait a minute.
- So--

447
00:35:35,541 --> 00:35:38,203
There could be ten other Michael
Faradays in Northern Virginia.

448
00:35:38,277 --> 00:35:41,610
- You would never know that.
- So I called Kansas State.

449
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:44,946
Here's what I'm saying.
Kansas State University...

450
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:48,145
had no Oliver Lang on record,
from that year or any year.

451
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:51,417
So either he didn't really
go to that school...

452
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:54,050
or that's not his real name.

453
00:35:54,126 --> 00:35:57,857
Can I ask you something? Did you
do this to me when we started dating?

454
00:35:57,930 --> 00:35:59,921
- What?
- Call up my ex-boyfriends...

455
00:35:59,999 --> 00:36:01,967
and get my transcripts sent over?

456
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:04,366
You've got to admit,
there's something not right here.

457
00:36:04,437 --> 00:36:07,998
No, this isn't right.
You have invaded his privacy.

458
00:36:08,074 --> 00:36:11,237
So maybe he lied about where
he went to college. Big deal.

459
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:14,711
People lie about things all the time.
You don't have the right to spy on them.

460
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:17,476
God, you of all people.

461
00:36:19,118 --> 00:36:21,211
Are you teaching the Bill of Rights
this semester...

462
00:36:21,287 --> 00:36:23,881
or did that not make the program?

463
00:36:26,492 --> 00:36:29,586
I don't know what you're doing.
We've made some friends here.

464
00:36:32,264 --> 00:36:33,697
All right?

465
00:36:35,634 --> 00:36:37,568
See you tonight.

466
00:36:58,057 --> 00:36:59,490
Lang.

467
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:42,900
Shit.

468
00:37:59,018 --> 00:38:00,315
Fenimore.

469
00:38:02,354 --> 00:38:06,313
'Cause you've never been away from
home before. You're nine years old.

470
00:38:06,392 --> 00:38:08,485
Nine and a halt.
There'll be grownups there.

471
00:38:08,561 --> 00:38:11,428
The answer is no, Grant.

472
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:13,431
It's spring vacation.
You said I could go.

473
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:16,559
Well, now I'm saying
that you can't go, Grant!

474
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:23,100
Look, maybe you can go
for summer camp or something, okay?

475
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:25,575
- Brady's going.
- Brady might not be the best kid...

476
00:38:25,644 --> 00:38:27,635
for you to be alone
in the woods with !

477
00:38:27,713 --> 00:38:31,205
- The answer is no!
- He's my best friend.

478
00:38:36,455 --> 00:38:41,950
Look, you want to go to camp, we'll go
to Aunt Ruth's and Uncle Rob's cabin.

479
00:38:42,027 --> 00:38:43,358
- Okay?
- That's a lie!

480
00:38:43,429 --> 00:38:47,923
- No it's not!
- You'll be too busy! You'll forget!

481
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,662
- You and me, we'll go--
- You'll forget you said I could go!

482
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:05,907
I hate him.

483
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:15,724
The FBI keeps a file
on every American...

484
00:39:15,794 --> 00:39:17,921
who has ever been
charged with a crime.

485
00:39:17,997 --> 00:39:22,661
Now, certain offenses
cause files to be flagged.

486
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:24,726
Two years ago, these flags...

487
00:39:24,803 --> 00:39:28,500
picked up a series of
suspicious firearms purchases...

488
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:31,509
in Maryland, Georgia
and the Carolinas.

489
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:33,772
Over a hundred guns from...

490
00:39:33,846 --> 00:39:36,406
assault rifles, army issues...

491
00:39:38,884 --> 00:39:43,651
all bought by acquaintances
of Seaver Parsons--

492
00:39:43,722 --> 00:39:47,681
husband, father of three,
amateur gun collector...

493
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,752
outspoken member of
the right-wing extremists...

494
00:39:50,829 --> 00:39:52,990
here in West Virginia.

495
00:39:53,065 --> 00:39:56,557
To the FBl, it appeared Parsons
was stockpiling weapons...

496
00:39:56,635 --> 00:39:58,603
for some sort of offensive.

497
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:03,602
So they sent tour FBI agents...

498
00:40:03,676 --> 00:40:05,803
with a search warrant here...

499
00:40:07,146 --> 00:40:10,206
thinking that they would uncover
some sort of treasure chest...

500
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:13,308
of felony firearms.

501
00:40:14,553 --> 00:40:18,489
- Munitions for war.
- 2-7 November, we got your eyeball.

502
00:40:24,563 --> 00:40:26,497
Backup's en route.

503
00:40:28,067 --> 00:40:30,399
How you gonna handle this, boss?

504
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:32,334
The easy way.

505
00:40:32,404 --> 00:40:34,338
Yeah, I heard that.

506
00:40:38,711 --> 00:40:40,645
Hey, there, mister.

507
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,973
You catch yourself some dinner?

508
00:40:47,052 --> 00:40:50,647
Is that your house over there?

509
00:40:53,225 --> 00:40:55,955
Know if your father's home, son?

510
00:40:56,028 --> 00:40:58,792
He don't know you.

511
00:40:58,864 --> 00:41:01,890
- No, son, we're from Washington.
- Here at this fence line...

512
00:41:01,967 --> 00:41:05,630
they encounter Parson's
youngest son, age ten.

513
00:41:06,805 --> 00:41:10,104
They asked him where his father was,
but they neglected--

514
00:41:10,175 --> 00:41:15,010
they tailed to first identity
themselves as Federal agents.

515
00:41:15,881 --> 00:41:20,284
Run up and ask your dad to come outside.
We'd like to speak to him.

516
00:41:21,086 --> 00:41:22,212
Okay?

517
00:41:29,395 --> 00:41:30,828
- Cover the house!
- No, stay here!

518
00:41:30,896 --> 00:41:32,796
Move! Go!

519
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:35,026
Stay!

520
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:37,068
The kid doesn't know
why we're here!

521
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:39,869
They're comin'!

522
00:41:39,938 --> 00:41:42,236
Jeb, they're comin'!
They're here!

523
00:41:48,814 --> 00:41:50,406
Ma, they're here!

524
00:41:58,290 --> 00:42:00,520
Cease tire!

525
00:42:14,006 --> 00:42:15,337
Ma!

526
00:42:41,133 --> 00:42:42,566
Go!

527
00:42:50,676 --> 00:42:52,610
Just hold on.

528
00:42:54,913 --> 00:42:57,780
Pinned down,
they returned fire.

529
00:42:59,551 --> 00:43:02,611
Finally,
the reinforcements arrived.

530
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:08,551
When it was over,
the siege lasted over two hours.

531
00:43:11,763 --> 00:43:16,700
At the end, Parson's
two eldest sons were wounded...

532
00:43:17,769 --> 00:43:21,466
his wife and his youngest boy
were killed.

533
00:43:22,674 --> 00:43:28,237
As for Parsons,
he wasn't even home.

534
00:44:14,927 --> 00:44:18,886
See, the FBl, they thought...

535
00:44:20,132 --> 00:44:24,432
that their people were uncovering
some sort of terrorist plot.

536
00:44:24,503 --> 00:44:28,667
You see? But what their tile,
their flags...

537
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:30,833
did not reveal to them...

538
00:44:32,377 --> 00:44:37,178
was that Seaver Parsons had
come into a family inheritance...

539
00:44:37,249 --> 00:44:40,082
with which he had arranged
the hundred legal firearms...

540
00:44:40,152 --> 00:44:42,086
to be legally purchased.

541
00:44:42,154 --> 00:44:46,352
Nor did it tell them that Parsons
had recently applied...

542
00:44:46,425 --> 00:44:48,950
for a sales license.

543
00:44:49,027 --> 00:44:52,929
Nor did it tell them that Parsons
warned his family...

544
00:44:52,998 --> 00:44:57,901
that some people might want
to steal his collection.

545
00:44:57,970 --> 00:45:01,167
He instructed his sons
and his wife...

546
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,868
and his daughter-in-law...

547
00:45:04,943 --> 00:45:10,347
never to let strangers on
this property while he was away...

548
00:45:10,415 --> 00:45:13,248
and if force be taken,
then to defend with force.

549
00:45:13,318 --> 00:45:15,252
Defend the home!

550
00:45:18,724 --> 00:45:21,887
You know, he had no love
for the Federal Government.

551
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:25,589
He did have a separatist
and suspicious past.

552
00:45:25,664 --> 00:45:30,033
But this was not a terrorist.
He was not a criminal.

553
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:34,163
Three innocent people
died that day...

554
00:45:34,239 --> 00:45:36,332
because the flags went up.

555
00:45:39,811 --> 00:45:41,745
The flags were wrong.

556
00:46:01,066 --> 00:46:03,000
Don't just dive in.
I want you to think for yourself.

557
00:46:03,068 --> 00:46:05,036
- I want you to be sate.
- Let go of my hand.

558
00:46:05,103 --> 00:46:07,037
Okay. Hey, look.

559
00:46:07,105 --> 00:46:10,131
I want you to have
a great time, okay?

560
00:46:10,208 --> 00:46:13,336
Listen to your troop master,
all right?

561
00:46:13,412 --> 00:46:15,812
Did Brooke tell you to let me go?

562
00:46:15,881 --> 00:46:18,076
Yes, she did,
as a matter of fact.

563
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:22,450
She said you're a big guy and you could
handle ten days away. She's right.

564
00:46:22,521 --> 00:46:26,150
When I get back, will she--

565
00:46:26,224 --> 00:46:28,317
Is she gonna take Mom's place?

566
00:46:30,529 --> 00:46:33,020
Nobody is ever gonna
take your mom's place.

567
00:46:33,098 --> 00:46:35,032
Not Brooke, nobody.

568
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:40,197
Mom is always gonna be with us,
right here...

569
00:46:41,139 --> 00:46:44,540
because we remember her like
nothing could ever take her away.

570
00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:50,309
If Brooke and I ever start thinking
about something like that...

571
00:46:50,382 --> 00:46:52,680
we're gonna talk
to you about it first.

572
00:46:52,751 --> 00:46:57,188
She'll only ever live with us
if Mom says it's okay too.

573
00:46:58,357 --> 00:46:59,483
Okay.

574
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:04,326
- You have a great time, okay?
- Thanks for camp, Dad.

575
00:47:05,664 --> 00:47:08,132
Have a good one.
All right.

576
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,998
- Thanks, Dad. See ya.
- All right. See ya later.

577
00:47:24,783 --> 00:47:27,445
His name was William Fenimore...

578
00:47:27,519 --> 00:47:30,920
and I'm told he changed it
to Oliver Lang.

579
00:47:30,989 --> 00:47:33,457
It may take me a few moments, sir.

580
00:47:42,801 --> 00:47:45,861
Okay, we do have
a William Fenimore...

581
00:47:45,937 --> 00:47:48,462
of Carson, Kansas,
changed to an Oliver Lang.

582
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:51,600
Oh, do you know when that was?

583
00:47:51,676 --> 00:47:54,270
October 5, 1981.

584
00:47:54,346 --> 00:47:57,873
Oh, thank you very much.
That's exactly what I was looking for.

585
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:09,293
State of Kansas,
Department of Records.

586
00:48:09,361 --> 00:48:13,923
Yes, hi. Michael Jones.
I'm with the EEOC in Washington.

587
00:48:13,999 --> 00:48:19,027
I've got a possible name change
I wanted to run by you guys.

588
00:48:19,104 --> 00:48:22,938
I'm looking for an Oliver Lang.
He's out of Carson, Kansas.

589
00:48:23,008 --> 00:48:24,942
Hold on, sir.

590
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,040
Sir, I'm afraid I've got
nothing on any name change...

591
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:33,482
for an Oliver Lang
of Carson, Kansas.

592
00:48:33,552 --> 00:48:35,645
Okay, just doin' my job.
Thank you.

593
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:38,518
Sir? Our records indicate
Oliver Lang deceased...

594
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:40,956
as of October 4, 1981.

595
00:48:41,026 --> 00:48:43,460
- October 4?
- Yes, sir.

596
00:48:50,435 --> 00:48:54,235
What does
the death certificate say?

597
00:48:55,006 --> 00:48:58,840
Cause of death is listed
as gunshot, hunting accident.

598
00:49:00,245 --> 00:49:03,009
You had said you were calling
with whom in Washington?

599
00:49:03,081 --> 00:49:04,912
Thank you.

600
00:49:09,287 --> 00:49:11,346
Just run through this scenario with me.

601
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:14,824
Theoretically,
why would someone do that?

602
00:49:14,893 --> 00:49:18,294
Do what? Change his name to the name
of a person who died the day before?

603
00:49:18,363 --> 00:49:21,821
Yeah. Someone the same age
from the same hometown.

604
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:25,734
Why? Would it be to take over
that person's life?

605
00:49:25,804 --> 00:49:27,738
No, that wouldn't work.

606
00:49:27,806 --> 00:49:30,536
When you die, the death certificate
goes both state and federal.

607
00:49:30,609 --> 00:49:34,807
Driver's licenses, Social Security
numbers, they're voided.

608
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:38,543
-Can't do it to hide the person you are.
-Then why would you do it?

609
00:49:38,617 --> 00:49:41,848
You'd do it to hide
the person you were.

610
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,445
Say you wanted to find out...

611
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:47,390
a criminal record for your guy
prior to the name change.

612
00:49:47,459 --> 00:49:51,395
- Unless you're a real professional--
- You'd check on the name he has now--

613
00:49:51,463 --> 00:49:54,455
And the records you'd find back then
would be for somebody else entirely.

614
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:58,435
That's the significance of making
the change right after a person's death.

615
00:49:58,503 --> 00:50:02,837
- No overlap.
- It gives you a whole new history.

616
00:50:02,908 --> 00:50:05,172
It helps the old one disappear.

617
00:50:08,013 --> 00:50:10,481
Is there something you want
to tell me, Michael?

618
00:50:11,616 --> 00:50:16,349
Whit, it I give you a name,
could you run it for flags?

619
00:50:16,421 --> 00:50:19,254
- Jesus!
- Just this once.

620
00:50:19,324 --> 00:50:22,350
Check out tiles as a personal favor,
is that what you're asking me to do?

621
00:50:22,427 --> 00:50:24,759
- Come on, I'm not--
- You go to jail for that.

622
00:50:24,829 --> 00:50:27,423
- This is important.
- My pension's important.

623
00:50:27,499 --> 00:50:30,730
Whit, I'm asking you to run a name.

624
00:50:30,802 --> 00:50:34,329
I'm not asking you to start surveillance
and break out the goddamn guns.

625
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:38,467
Faraday, it you'd asked your wife to
do it, she'd tell you the same thing.

626
00:50:38,543 --> 00:50:40,841
Get you classified FBI information.

627
00:50:40,912 --> 00:50:43,506
She'd say,
"l love you, baby, but that...

628
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:45,516
I cannot do."

629
00:50:47,085 --> 00:50:51,283
It you want to find out about somebody,
there's always ways to do it.

630
00:50:51,356 --> 00:50:55,656
They're just not through me.
Come on. Use your imagination.

631
00:51:07,973 --> 00:51:10,703
Oh, hi, Daphne.
How you doin'?

632
00:51:12,043 --> 00:51:13,738
You doing okay?

633
00:51:17,482 --> 00:51:20,940
- Hi, Hannah.
- Mommy and Daddy aren't home.

634
00:51:21,019 --> 00:51:25,217
Oh, well, actually,
I don't need your mom and dad.

635
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:29,386
You know what?
I locked myself out of my house.

636
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:33,727
- I came home from work and realized--
- We can't let strangers in.

637
00:51:33,798 --> 00:51:36,631
Well, I'm not a stranger, right?

638
00:51:39,704 --> 00:51:43,037
See, what I need to do
is use your phone...

639
00:51:44,109 --> 00:51:48,978
to call up somebody to see if
they'll help me get in the house.

640
00:51:49,047 --> 00:51:52,016
Would that be all right...

641
00:51:52,851 --> 00:51:54,785
if I use your phone?

642
00:51:56,187 --> 00:51:59,748
- Kitchen.
- Good.

643
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:04,824
I'm gonna use the phone
in your dad's study.

644
00:52:04,896 --> 00:52:07,694
- You guys are playin' here.
- That's Dad's study.

645
00:52:07,766 --> 00:52:11,167
I'll just be a sec.
You guys go ahead and play.

646
00:52:11,236 --> 00:52:13,170
Your dad won't mind.

647
00:52:24,482 --> 00:52:27,110
Hello. Yes, I've got a--

648
00:52:28,053 --> 00:52:29,987
a home lockout.

649
00:52:31,122 --> 00:52:33,454
I need your help to get back in.

650
00:52:34,859 --> 00:52:36,292
Faraday, Michael.

651
00:52:40,432 --> 00:52:44,698
2505 Arlington Road in Reston.

652
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:48,195
No, that's no problem.

653
00:52:48,273 --> 00:52:51,003
I have identification.

654
00:53:58,343 --> 00:54:01,437
- You locked yourself out.
- Scared the shit out of me.

655
00:54:01,513 --> 00:54:04,038
Yeah, I was on the phone...

656
00:54:04,115 --> 00:54:07,209
and the picture was falling--
crooked-- so l--

657
00:54:09,521 --> 00:54:11,751
Yeah, the locksmith guy's comin'.

658
00:54:11,823 --> 00:54:14,451
Good. Did you want to wait here?
I'm just back from the store.

659
00:54:14,526 --> 00:54:17,051
No thanks.

660
00:54:17,128 --> 00:54:19,722
I got a call from Brady today.

661
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:22,323
He and Grant are having
a wonderful time.

662
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,130
He went on and on about what kind
of bugs they're catching.

663
00:54:25,203 --> 00:54:27,569
I don't know if there's
any kind of badge for that.

664
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:30,039
Can I offer you something?

665
00:54:30,108 --> 00:54:32,042
No, I've got a--

666
00:54:32,110 --> 00:54:36,604
I should really get back. There's
some papers I can grade while I wait.

667
00:54:36,681 --> 00:54:40,276
But thank you for the call.

668
00:54:40,351 --> 00:54:41,750
Sure.

669
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:44,118
Thank you, girls.

670
00:54:44,189 --> 00:54:46,282
Our house is your house.

671
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:56,930
Just a sec.
You forgot your case.

672
00:54:57,001 --> 00:54:58,935
And your phone.

673
00:55:01,873 --> 00:55:03,898
Need to recharge my batteries.

674
00:55:03,975 --> 00:55:05,909
I know the feeling.

675
00:55:17,522 --> 00:55:21,515
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Pretending to wait for a locksmith.

676
00:55:21,593 --> 00:55:24,061
- Right.
- Pretended to be locked out.

677
00:55:24,128 --> 00:55:27,291
Uh-huh.
Why was that again?

678
00:55:27,365 --> 00:55:29,663
I'll explain it to you.

679
00:55:29,734 --> 00:55:32,066
Can we pretend
to have dinner first?

680
00:56:07,272 --> 00:56:09,570
Hi, neighbor.

681
00:56:38,369 --> 00:56:39,631
"Pipe bomb."

682
00:56:47,545 --> 00:56:49,638
"Special state agency."

683
00:56:52,583 --> 00:56:55,347
"William Fenimore Senior."

684
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:57,354
How's the hunting?

685
00:57:00,325 --> 00:57:01,758
Hey, Oliver.

686
00:57:04,595 --> 00:57:09,157
I was in the city on a project. Went by
your office. They said check here.

687
00:57:09,233 --> 00:57:13,226
- Got some research goin'?
- Yeah, the '70s--

688
00:57:14,839 --> 00:57:17,603
- Is that The Kansas City Star?
- Yeah.

689
00:57:17,675 --> 00:57:21,406
- That's the paper I read growin' up.
- It's for a lecture course.

690
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:23,845
I got a class...

691
00:57:23,915 --> 00:57:27,282
that deals with extremist groups.

692
00:57:28,386 --> 00:57:32,755
You know, American history.
Background on state militias.

693
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:35,691
There's one in Kansas.

694
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:38,627
Seems they got one everywhere.

695
00:57:38,696 --> 00:57:41,665
Jeez, I didn't know you taught
a course in terrorism.

696
00:57:41,733 --> 00:57:44,600
- That a pretty frightening subject.
- Yeah.

697
00:57:48,106 --> 00:57:52,543
- You got time for a drink?
- No, today's not good.

698
00:57:52,610 --> 00:57:54,771
Yeah, I hear ya.
I got a building contract...

699
00:57:54,846 --> 00:57:58,247
that's kickin' my butt
tryin' to put it together.

700
00:57:58,316 --> 00:58:00,181
Get back to work.

701
00:58:00,251 --> 00:58:03,516
Sorry to drop by.
Catch you back at the ranch.

702
00:58:03,588 --> 00:58:05,715
Good to see you.

703
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:12,157
Will you just hear me out?
Hear what I'm saying?

704
00:58:12,230 --> 00:58:15,290
The guy changed his name, Brooke.
Why?

705
00:58:16,367 --> 00:58:19,996
To help hide his background.
Why? Because there's something in it.

706
00:58:20,071 --> 00:58:22,039
Yeah, something that's
not your business.

707
00:58:22,106 --> 00:58:25,269
When he was 16 years old,
he tried to blow up some offices.

708
00:58:25,343 --> 00:58:30,144
Read the paper! A government agency
that was cheating his father's farm.

709
00:58:30,214 --> 00:58:32,876
He served time
in a juvenile program.

710
00:58:34,218 --> 00:58:36,618
Pipe bomb as a kid.

711
00:58:36,687 --> 00:58:40,145
Why would you
go to these lengths...

712
00:58:40,224 --> 00:58:44,820
to hide that part of your history
if it wasn't an isolated event?

713
00:58:44,896 --> 00:58:47,023
If you thought you might
try it again someday?

714
00:58:47,098 --> 00:58:49,566
It says it didn't even go oft.
He was a kid.

715
00:58:50,635 --> 00:58:55,129
Brady practically killed himself
with a bunch of fireworks in March.

716
00:58:55,206 --> 00:58:59,939
Come on ! Where do you think
Brady gets an idea like that?

717
00:59:00,011 --> 00:59:02,536
What are you saying?

718
00:59:02,613 --> 00:59:06,174
I'm saying that he's gone to these
great lengths to hide his past.

719
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:10,084
I'm saying that he was in St. Louis
when the federal building was bombed.

720
00:59:10,154 --> 00:59:14,022
And I'm saying that there is
a blueprint in his house...

721
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:16,526
that he does not want me to see!

722
00:59:20,698 --> 00:59:23,360
- Are you listening to yourself?
- Are you listening to me?

723
00:59:23,434 --> 00:59:25,493
- Your neighbor?
- Yes!

724
00:59:25,570 --> 00:59:28,038
Is a terrorist?

725
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:30,404
He's been blowing up buildings?

726
00:59:30,475 --> 00:59:35,003
There's something going on over there.
Something is being planned.

727
00:59:35,079 --> 00:59:37,604
Something's being planned?
Yeah, and in his spare time...

728
00:59:37,682 --> 00:59:41,277
hey pays the mortgage
and takes his kid to camp.

729
00:59:41,352 --> 00:59:45,846
- That house is not normal.
- That house is normal!

730
00:59:45,923 --> 00:59:48,391
Remember when we were over there
the other night?

731
00:59:48,459 --> 00:59:51,019
- Him discussing politics?
- Yeah, we disagree about politics.

732
00:59:51,095 --> 00:59:54,258
And Washington?
And Leah?

733
00:59:54,332 --> 00:59:56,300
- Do you remember this?
- Oh, my--

734
00:59:56,367 --> 00:59:58,699
The guy is testing me.

735
00:59:58,769 --> 01:00:02,136
He wants to see
it I'm an enemy or an ally.

736
01:00:03,241 --> 01:00:06,699
You are the one who brought up Leah.

737
01:00:06,777 --> 01:00:09,678
Is that what this is about?

738
01:00:09,747 --> 01:00:12,215
No, it's not about Leah!

739
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:18,520
You know, this class...

740
01:00:18,589 --> 01:00:21,251
that you slave over...

741
01:00:21,325 --> 01:00:26,160
to carry on Leah's work,
to have something in her memory?

742
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:33,363
You know,
plots and conspiracies...

743
01:00:33,437 --> 01:00:36,031
and red flags going up.

744
01:00:36,107 --> 01:00:39,133
Yeah, this is Leah's world now.

745
01:00:41,212 --> 01:00:42,804
I'm--

746
01:00:50,087 --> 01:00:51,679
I can't.

747
01:00:54,625 --> 01:00:57,059
Listen, I know...

748
01:00:57,128 --> 01:01:00,655
that he's changed his name--

749
01:01:00,731 --> 01:01:03,359
- Stop it, for me.
- He lived in St Louis...

750
01:01:03,434 --> 01:01:06,232
when the bombs were goin' off.

751
01:01:06,304 --> 01:01:09,740
He's working on this building
that he doesn't want me to see.

752
01:01:14,178 --> 01:01:16,112
I don't think
I can stay here tonight.

753
01:01:17,748 --> 01:01:20,273
I'm not staying.

754
01:02:34,258 --> 01:02:36,488
Never did like that picture.

755
01:02:39,330 --> 01:02:41,264
You know me, Michael?

756
01:02:42,333 --> 01:02:44,301
You think you know me?

757
01:02:45,903 --> 01:02:48,872
Yeah, you know me better
than I know myself, don't you?

758
01:02:49,874 --> 01:02:52,342
Kansas City Star.
I saw you.

759
01:02:52,410 --> 01:02:55,038
You wanna tell me something
I don't know?

760
01:02:56,514 --> 01:02:59,950
- I know what I read.
- You know a 16-year-old kid.

761
01:03:02,053 --> 01:03:04,078
You don't know me.

762
01:03:04,155 --> 01:03:06,316
You know a kid at 16.

763
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:12,028
Damn you!
You've been a guest in my house!

764
01:03:12,096 --> 01:03:14,894
You're a guest in mine, Fenimore.

765
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,730
Bill, Will, William--
What do I call you?

766
01:03:18,803 --> 01:03:22,830
Who the hell do you think you are
judging me? What gives you the right?

767
01:03:26,177 --> 01:03:28,145
You ever worked on a farm?

768
01:03:33,217 --> 01:03:35,811
Make your living,
support your family?

769
01:03:37,321 --> 01:03:43,191
The government stole my father's water--
a stream running through our land.

770
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:45,854
Said they were appropriating it
for other uses.

771
01:03:47,465 --> 01:03:51,561
We couldn't grow crops,
we couldn't raise cattle.

772
01:03:51,635 --> 01:03:54,069
We had loans we couldn't pay.

773
01:03:56,006 --> 01:03:57,940
My father woke up one mornin'...

774
01:03:58,008 --> 01:04:01,500
and he realized
he was worth more dead than alive.

775
01:04:03,047 --> 01:04:05,709
His skin and bones...

776
01:04:05,783 --> 01:04:08,581
were worth more
in insurance money...

777
01:04:08,652 --> 01:04:10,950
than as a damn farmer.

778
01:04:13,758 --> 01:04:16,693
I found his tractor...

779
01:04:16,761 --> 01:04:19,730
at the bottom of the bluffs
behind our house.

780
01:04:19,797 --> 01:04:21,731
He made it look like an accident.

781
01:04:21,799 --> 01:04:26,759
I found his body.
And the note?

782
01:04:29,006 --> 01:04:30,997
He wrote it to me.

783
01:04:37,047 --> 01:04:39,811
Insurance money paid off
what Mom could...

784
01:04:39,884 --> 01:04:42,478
but it wasn't enough.

785
01:04:43,554 --> 01:04:47,718
Neighbors--
Neighbors took our land at auction.

786
01:04:49,293 --> 01:04:52,956
All because some bureaucrat
stuck a pin in a map...

787
01:04:54,665 --> 01:04:58,465
in some creek in the middle of Kansas,
said we couldn't use our own water.

788
01:04:58,536 --> 01:05:00,470
Doesn't give you the right
to build a bomb.

789
01:05:00,538 --> 01:05:04,201
I was sixteen.
Sixteen!

790
01:05:04,275 --> 01:05:07,369
You ever do anything wrong
when you were 16?

791
01:05:08,612 --> 01:05:10,944
You ever crash your car?

792
01:05:11,015 --> 01:05:15,714
You ever, uh, steal anything?
You ever screw the wrong girl?

793
01:05:15,786 --> 01:05:18,448
You gonna tell your kid everything
you did when you were 16?

794
01:05:18,522 --> 01:05:21,184
The lies you told?
The drugs you took?

795
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:25,094
I've been judged for this!

796
01:05:25,162 --> 01:05:29,826
I got sent away for it, and it was
the best thing that ever happened to me.

797
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:31,834
The best thing.

798
01:05:38,609 --> 01:05:40,201
Who's Oliver?

799
01:05:48,419 --> 01:05:50,751
He was my best friend growin' up.

800
01:05:53,924 --> 01:05:56,654
He died when we were both 25.

801
01:05:59,163 --> 01:06:01,097
I did it to honor him...

802
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:05,268
to carry on his name.

803
01:06:07,271 --> 01:06:09,205
And to hide.

804
01:06:10,674 --> 01:06:12,608
Yeah, to hide.

805
01:06:14,211 --> 01:06:17,738
I didn't want any son I had
knowing what I did.

806
01:06:19,950 --> 01:06:23,511
I didn't want my kids
to be burdened...

807
01:06:23,587 --> 01:06:26,647
with people looking through
old newspapers.

808
01:06:28,993 --> 01:06:31,655
I'm not proud of this.

809
01:06:33,964 --> 01:06:35,989
This isn't pride.

810
01:06:38,402 --> 01:06:41,030
I wish it never happened.

811
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:46,501
You know, I wish to God...

812
01:06:46,577 --> 01:06:49,307
that my family could have...

813
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:52,042
my father's good name.

814
01:06:57,655 --> 01:07:00,783
You know, you have a right
to know who lives next door...

815
01:07:00,858 --> 01:07:05,591
who talks to your kid,
who considers himself your friend.

816
01:07:07,231 --> 01:07:09,927
But you also have the right--

817
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,060
It you have a problem with me,
it you have issues with me...

818
01:07:14,939 --> 01:07:18,375
you could have the decency
to walk across the street...

819
01:07:18,442 --> 01:07:21,104
and tell me to my face.

820
01:11:29,793 --> 01:11:32,557
Hi, this is Michael.
Leave a message.

821
01:11:32,629 --> 01:11:34,927
It's me. Listen.

822
01:11:34,998 --> 01:11:38,297
I think you're right.
I saw Oliver...

823
01:11:38,368 --> 01:11:41,997
at the mall in the garage.

824
01:11:42,072 --> 01:11:45,803
He switched cars with somebody,
and I followed him...

825
01:11:45,876 --> 01:11:48,140
to this warehouse delivery place.

826
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:54,680
They were unloading
these long, metal boxes.

827
01:11:56,720 --> 01:12:01,157
I want to talk to you.
I'm coming over, okay?

828
01:12:09,566 --> 01:12:11,261
I knew it was you.

829
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:19,341
What are you doing here?

830
01:12:22,613 --> 01:12:26,606
Just shopping.
What are you doing here?

831
01:12:28,685 --> 01:12:30,277
Shopping.

832
01:12:33,724 --> 01:12:35,521
Great.

833
01:12:35,592 --> 01:12:37,184
Yeah.

834
01:12:56,580 --> 01:13:00,380
They say a man was shot several times
while driving along 19th street.

835
01:13:00,450 --> 01:13:04,181
The car struck several other vehicles
before slamming into a tree.

836
01:13:04,254 --> 01:13:07,382
The victim was pronounced
dead at the scene.

837
01:13:07,457 --> 01:13:09,618
Elsewhere, a single-car accident
near Reston is tying up...

838
01:13:09,693 --> 01:13:12,753
evening traffic on westbound
Route 7 at this hour.

839
01:13:12,829 --> 01:13:15,559
Details are sketchy at this point.
What we can tell you...

840
01:13:15,632 --> 01:13:17,862
from our overhead shot is that
the accident took place...

841
01:13:17,935 --> 01:13:20,130
near the Pine Glenn Outlet Center.

842
01:13:20,203 --> 01:13:22,501
No other vehicles appear to be
involved in what police say...

843
01:13:22,572 --> 01:13:24,164
is a fatal crash.

844
01:13:24,241 --> 01:13:27,768
We'll have more information for you
when it becomes available.

845
01:13:30,013 --> 01:13:32,777
The driver of the car, described
as a woman in her mid-20s...

846
01:13:32,849 --> 01:13:34,817
has been pronounced dead
at the scene.

847
01:13:34,885 --> 01:13:38,412
Police say it appears she lost control
of the light blue 1989 Mustang...

848
01:13:38,488 --> 01:13:41,116
and crashed through a guardrail
along the ravine.

849
01:13:41,191 --> 01:13:44,683
Investigators believe
she was killed upon impact--

850
01:14:04,648 --> 01:14:06,775
Sir, you can't go down there.

851
01:14:06,850 --> 01:14:09,148
Sir, you can't come down here.

852
01:14:09,219 --> 01:14:11,119
- You can't go down there.
- Where is she?

853
01:14:14,024 --> 01:14:16,049
- She's gone sir. Been taken away.
- Where?

854
01:14:19,296 --> 01:14:21,560
- She's gone.
- Where?

855
01:14:21,631 --> 01:14:23,223
I'm sorry.

856
01:15:04,908 --> 01:15:06,773
Hey, General,
how you holding up?

857
01:15:06,843 --> 01:15:09,403
You wouldn't believe it!
It's so cool.

858
01:15:09,479 --> 01:15:12,710
We went swimming and climbing, and
one night there was a lightning storm.

859
01:15:12,783 --> 01:15:15,775
- We had to stay in a motel!
- You did?

860
01:15:15,852 --> 01:15:19,253
I learned how to make campfires,
and there's lots of knives.

861
01:15:19,322 --> 01:15:23,224
- Me and Brady can tell animal tracks.
- That's terrific.

862
01:15:23,293 --> 01:15:25,693
I've gotta go.
Troop Master's calling us.

863
01:15:25,762 --> 01:15:28,230
- We're doing a hike!
- Okay. Grant?

864
01:15:28,298 --> 01:15:30,858
I'll see you in a couple of days.
I love you.

865
01:15:30,934 --> 01:15:32,799
- I gotta go!
- Grant?

866
01:15:42,512 --> 01:15:45,538
It's better to tell him
when he gets back.

867
01:15:52,656 --> 01:15:54,624
Thanks for coming to get me.

868
01:15:54,691 --> 01:15:58,593
If there's anything you need...

869
01:15:58,662 --> 01:16:00,687
we're here.

870
01:16:00,764 --> 01:16:04,222
No, I won't.
I'll be tine.

871
01:16:07,237 --> 01:16:10,502
Don't let yourself-- I mean, sometimes
it's better not to be alone...

872
01:16:10,574 --> 01:16:12,542
when you don't have to be.

873
01:16:12,609 --> 01:16:14,543
She was a good person.

874
01:16:16,413 --> 01:16:19,348
Kind, kind girl.

875
01:16:19,416 --> 01:16:21,145
You know, it l--

876
01:16:21,218 --> 01:16:24,210
It I haven't been myself
these past few weeks--

877
01:16:27,457 --> 01:16:29,857
I'm sorry, for everything.

878
01:16:31,161 --> 01:16:33,459
She liked you...

879
01:16:33,530 --> 01:16:35,794
and your family very much.

880
01:16:40,170 --> 01:16:43,367
We're here for you.
We really are.

881
01:17:15,939 --> 01:17:18,237
- Hello?
- Michael, it's Whit.

882
01:17:18,308 --> 01:17:20,640
Haven't heard back from you, man.

883
01:17:24,648 --> 01:17:26,980
My girlfriend, Brooke,
was killed Friday.

884
01:17:27,050 --> 01:17:30,850
- Oh, God. No.
- Yeah.

885
01:17:32,422 --> 01:17:34,356
Can I talk to you later?

886
01:17:34,424 --> 01:17:38,224
Yeah, sure, whenever.
I'm here at the office.

887
01:17:38,295 --> 01:17:39,887
Thanks.

888
01:17:56,780 --> 01:17:59,112
- Agent Carver.
- Whit?

889
01:17:59,182 --> 01:18:02,948
What did you mean,
you haven't heard back from me?

890
01:18:03,019 --> 01:18:06,250
The message I left on Friday.
I understand now.

891
01:18:06,323 --> 01:18:09,292
- It's all right.
- What message?

892
01:18:09,359 --> 01:18:11,953
Well, the one about
speaking to your class.

893
01:18:12,028 --> 01:18:17,193
I thought with some ground rules,
we could set some things straight.

894
01:18:17,267 --> 01:18:19,792
Wait, wait, wait.
You called me Friday?

895
01:18:19,869 --> 01:18:23,032
- You left a message?
- Yeah, at the house.

896
01:18:27,978 --> 01:18:30,412
When did you call?

897
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:34,416
I don't know.
Around 4:00 or 5:00, maybe, on Friday.

898
01:18:38,888 --> 01:18:41,584
I didn't have any messages.

899
01:18:41,658 --> 01:18:44,252
For Christ's sakes,
you just found out about Brooke.

900
01:18:44,327 --> 01:18:48,593
No, I didn't have any messages.
I'll call you back.

901
01:18:57,374 --> 01:18:59,342
Whit, listen to me.

902
01:18:59,409 --> 01:19:01,934
I know you can't do anything for me
or get me information...

903
01:19:02,012 --> 01:19:03,673
but I can give you information.

904
01:19:03,747 --> 01:19:07,683
The other day when I was talking about
somebody trying to hide their history?

905
01:19:07,751 --> 01:19:11,847
I was talking about my neighbor.
Oliver Lang-- that's his name.

906
01:19:11,921 --> 01:19:14,355
He used to be--

907
01:19:14,424 --> 01:19:19,123
It used to be William Fenimore. Run it
through your system, see what you got.

908
01:19:19,195 --> 01:19:21,993
- Oliver Lang. You writing this down?
- All right, slow down.

909
01:19:22,065 --> 01:19:24,693
This guy has a history, damn it!
Will you run the name?

910
01:19:24,768 --> 01:19:27,236
- Wait. What's he done?
- It I'm right...

911
01:19:27,304 --> 01:19:30,034
there are other people who called
my house that day, not just you.

912
01:19:30,106 --> 01:19:32,336
Find out. You can do that.
Please.

913
01:19:32,409 --> 01:19:34,969
- I'll call you when I get back.
- Where the hell are you going?

914
01:19:35,045 --> 01:19:36,706
To get you proof.
Run the name, Whit.

915
01:20:25,395 --> 01:20:27,329
Was it hard to find me?

916
01:20:28,598 --> 01:20:31,066
You've moved several times.

917
01:20:31,134 --> 01:20:35,002
Your wife said that--
Your ex-wife said--

918
01:20:35,071 --> 01:20:38,199
People know whose father I am.

919
01:20:40,710 --> 01:20:45,044
Mister, I've been through
all this before.

920
01:20:45,115 --> 01:20:47,709
The government, the police...

921
01:20:49,486 --> 01:20:51,078
and writers.

922
01:20:53,656 --> 01:20:56,386
People wanted to believe
it was political...

923
01:20:56,459 --> 01:20:59,087
some conspiracy, some group.

924
01:20:59,162 --> 01:21:02,393
Happy and I did too.

925
01:21:02,465 --> 01:21:04,660
Dean was not a strong boy.

926
01:21:04,734 --> 01:21:07,202
He was impressionable...

927
01:21:07,270 --> 01:21:10,205
believed what friends
around him said.

928
01:21:10,273 --> 01:21:13,140
Well, why couldn't he be involved...

929
01:21:13,209 --> 01:21:15,734
with people who could set him up...

930
01:21:15,812 --> 01:21:18,337
talk him into even this?

931
01:21:21,251 --> 01:21:25,517
The FBl, the police,
found nothing.

932
01:21:27,257 --> 01:21:32,058
It was him alone.
They decided this.

933
01:21:32,128 --> 01:21:34,119
Sixty-three dead...

934
01:21:35,598 --> 01:21:37,691
over taxes.

935
01:21:39,202 --> 01:21:40,692
Dean alone.

936
01:21:40,770 --> 01:21:43,364
You don't believe that, do you?

937
01:21:45,141 --> 01:21:47,075
I've never believed that.

938
01:21:47,143 --> 01:21:50,544
Have you heard the name
Oliver Lang or William Fenimore?

939
01:21:50,613 --> 01:21:52,547
I've heard too many names.

940
01:21:52,615 --> 01:21:56,278
Your son, Dean, was an electrician.

941
01:21:56,352 --> 01:21:59,947
Maybe he was contracted for...

942
01:22:00,023 --> 01:22:03,322
or he worked on a project--

943
01:22:03,393 --> 01:22:06,988
All of this
was investigated, mister!

944
01:22:07,063 --> 01:22:10,089
His neighbors, his customers...

945
01:22:10,166 --> 01:22:12,293
kids he grew up with
months ago.

946
01:22:12,368 --> 01:22:15,599
Dr. Scobee, I'm sorry
for bringing this all back.

947
01:22:15,672 --> 01:22:17,606
It never goes away.

948
01:22:17,674 --> 01:22:20,575
I had to come here.
You've got to understand.

949
01:22:20,643 --> 01:22:22,611
I think I know a man
who knew your son.

950
01:22:22,679 --> 01:22:25,648
He's 41, a structural engineer.

951
01:22:25,715 --> 01:22:28,650
He's got a wife, three kids.
He has this--

952
01:22:28,718 --> 01:22:31,516
May I ask what makes you so sure...

953
01:22:31,588 --> 01:22:34,921
that this man of yours had anything
to do with what happened here?

954
01:22:34,991 --> 01:22:38,256
For the same reason you're sure
your son didn't do it alone!

955
01:22:38,328 --> 01:22:42,856
I know my son was not alone,
because 10 children died that day!

956
01:22:42,932 --> 01:22:46,766
The day care center in the Roosevelt,
he had to know it was there.

957
01:22:46,836 --> 01:22:49,464
My son would never have done
anything to harm children.

958
01:22:49,539 --> 01:22:51,769
Your son didn't have any children.

959
01:22:51,841 --> 01:22:53,741
No!

960
01:22:53,810 --> 01:22:57,405
But he did things for them.

961
01:22:57,480 --> 01:23:00,347
He sponsored boys
from city shelters.

962
01:23:00,416 --> 01:23:05,718
Discoverer Troops. He coached
boys' football when he had time.

963
01:23:05,788 --> 01:23:08,382
Wait. Discoverer Troops?

964
01:23:10,894 --> 01:23:13,158
They're like Boy Scouts,
but for young children.

965
01:23:18,368 --> 01:23:21,201
He was a grown-up chaperon.

966
01:23:21,271 --> 01:23:26,106
He'd take them camping,
go to their meetings.

967
01:23:26,175 --> 01:23:29,838
Teach them.
There he is.

968
01:23:29,913 --> 01:23:32,643
It must have been
on some weekend adventure.

969
01:23:35,885 --> 01:23:39,150
Dean was best with children.

970
01:24:01,678 --> 01:24:03,077
Airport.

971
01:24:05,114 --> 01:24:07,639
Faraday, Grant Faraday.
I'll be there in a few hours.

972
01:24:07,717 --> 01:24:11,175
Don't let him go anywhere.
I'm coming. Tell him I'm coming.

973
01:24:26,869 --> 01:24:31,897
I'm here to pick up my son.
I called earlier this afternoon.

974
01:24:31,975 --> 01:24:34,102
- My son !
- What was that troop, sir?

975
01:24:34,177 --> 01:24:36,771
Troop? I don't know what troop.

976
01:24:36,846 --> 01:24:39,246
He's from Reston.
Grant Faraday.

977
01:24:41,484 --> 01:24:43,475
- Where's my son?
- Faraday.

978
01:24:44,854 --> 01:24:46,412
He was taken home
this afternoon, sir.

979
01:24:46,489 --> 01:24:48,719
- No.
- His father called.

980
01:24:48,791 --> 01:24:51,385
No, no, wait.
I'm his father. I called.

981
01:24:51,461 --> 01:24:55,295
But you called twice, sir.

982
01:24:55,365 --> 01:24:58,266
You said that there had been
an accident at home?

983
01:24:58,334 --> 01:25:00,234
- A car accident?
- No!

984
01:25:00,303 --> 01:25:02,601
You asked to speak
with his troop master, sir.

985
01:25:02,672 --> 01:25:04,663
I'm his goddamn father!
That wasn't me.

986
01:25:04,774 --> 01:25:07,242
Here it is, sir.
He was driven home.

987
01:25:07,310 --> 01:25:10,802
- By who?
- His troop master, sir.

988
01:25:13,650 --> 01:25:17,643
- He and another boy.
- What other boy?

989
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:19,688
Lang, Brady Lang.

990
01:25:20,990 --> 01:25:24,289
The troop master left
with both of them.

991
01:27:13,603 --> 01:27:17,232
You're doing it again. I thought
I told you to come to me...

992
01:27:17,306 --> 01:27:19,240
- if there's something you wanna know.
- Where's my son?

993
01:27:19,308 --> 01:27:21,242
He's with mine. They're safe.
Can I get you something?

994
01:27:21,310 --> 01:27:23,244
- I saved his life!
- Some punch? What's that?

995
01:27:23,312 --> 01:27:25,542
- Your son, I saved his life!
- Yes, yes.

996
01:27:25,615 --> 01:27:27,810
And that's why
you're still here with us.

997
01:27:27,884 --> 01:27:30,682
- And Brooke?
- Brooke got in the way.

998
01:27:30,753 --> 01:27:33,051
We're on a schedule.
It's nothing personal.

999
01:27:33,122 --> 01:27:35,852
What the hell have you done
with my son?

1000
01:27:35,925 --> 01:27:39,884
It you want to be his father,
you'll walk to your house...

1001
01:27:39,962 --> 01:27:43,193
sleep in your bed,
teach your classes and live your life.

1002
01:27:43,266 --> 01:27:46,099
What are you telling me?
How many people are you gonna kill?

1003
01:27:46,169 --> 01:27:49,764
Well, it I see
any strange cars on my street...

1004
01:27:49,839 --> 01:27:53,172
it you feel compelled to talk
to anyone-- a federal agent, perhaps--

1005
01:27:53,242 --> 01:27:56,268
then I imagine
we're just gonna kill one.

1006
01:27:56,345 --> 01:27:58,836
He's nine years old.

1007
01:27:58,915 --> 01:28:01,543
When will he be ten?

1008
01:28:04,587 --> 01:28:06,521
He's a good kid.

1009
01:28:06,589 --> 01:28:08,557
A strong kid.

1010
01:28:08,624 --> 01:28:12,617
Reminds me of a boy I grew up with.
Maybe you've heard of him.

1011
01:28:12,695 --> 01:28:16,096
Oliver Lang?

1012
01:28:16,165 --> 01:28:18,793
I found him in the woods one day.

1013
01:28:18,868 --> 01:28:21,860
I would hate for Grant
to see the same for you.

1014
01:28:21,938 --> 01:28:25,772
- You sick fuck!
- You're the sick fuck!

1015
01:28:33,616 --> 01:28:35,550
I promise you, Michael.

1016
01:28:37,887 --> 01:28:41,118
It you stay a good neighbor,
and you are a good a neighbor...

1017
01:28:43,259 --> 01:28:45,193
you'll have him back.

1018
01:28:45,261 --> 01:28:50,392
But it you don't calm down, I don't know
that I can guarantee his safety.

1019
01:28:52,034 --> 01:28:55,401
- This will all be over in a few days.
- When?

1020
01:28:55,471 --> 01:28:58,963
- You're not in any danger.
- When? Tell me.

1021
01:29:02,378 --> 01:29:03,970
Please.

1022
01:29:06,182 --> 01:29:08,480
Because of you, my son is alive.

1023
01:29:10,653 --> 01:29:13,451
I would like very much
to return the favor.

1024
01:29:16,092 --> 01:29:18,151
Now...

1025
01:29:18,227 --> 01:29:20,161
we're having a party.

1026
01:29:22,598 --> 01:29:25,692
You're more than welcome to stay.

1027
01:30:33,035 --> 01:30:35,230
You're a hard man to find.

1028
01:30:35,304 --> 01:30:37,568
What are you, uh--

1029
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:42,543
Your assistant told me you've been
taking long walks between classes.

1030
01:30:42,611 --> 01:30:45,239
Yeah, I can't talk to you now.

1031
01:30:45,314 --> 01:30:48,112
No? Can you talk to me ever?

1032
01:30:49,986 --> 01:30:52,580
You look like shit.
What's going on?

1033
01:30:55,992 --> 01:30:59,359
- I'm here about Oliver Lang.
- I gotta get to my class.

1034
01:30:59,428 --> 01:31:02,955
Well, how about
you teach me something?

1035
01:31:03,032 --> 01:31:06,559
Oliver Lang,
formerly William Fenimore.

1036
01:31:06,635 --> 01:31:09,536
We gave him a good look
after the St. Louis thing.

1037
01:31:09,605 --> 01:31:13,132
Everybody who ever used a bomb
got a good look.

1038
01:31:13,209 --> 01:31:15,143
His name change was legal.

1039
01:31:15,211 --> 01:31:18,305
We ran his social security number
through the National Crime Center.

1040
01:31:18,381 --> 01:31:22,681
Not a mark on his record ever since.
Him and everyone he knew came up clean.

1041
01:31:27,556 --> 01:31:29,990
That's what you found out about, huh?

1042
01:31:32,194 --> 01:31:36,358
Yeah, that Wichita shit back when
he was 16 got you thinking, huh?

1043
01:31:36,432 --> 01:31:40,300
Do you have something new on him
or do you just not like him...

1044
01:31:40,369 --> 01:31:41,893
in your neighborhood?

1045
01:31:41,971 --> 01:31:46,533
'Cause if this is all you got, then
you need to stop teaching that class...

1046
01:31:46,609 --> 01:31:48,634
'cause it's gettin' inside your head.

1047
01:31:48,711 --> 01:31:52,112
You tell me you got something
to go on and I'll go...

1048
01:31:52,181 --> 01:31:55,241
but I'm not gonna walk into another
Copper Creek, and neither should you.

1049
01:31:55,317 --> 01:31:59,651
I got nothing.
I'm sorry.

1050
01:32:01,857 --> 01:32:03,791
All right. Look.

1051
01:32:06,062 --> 01:32:08,587
I ran those phone records,
like you asked.

1052
01:32:08,664 --> 01:32:11,792
Could've meant my job,
but I did it.

1053
01:32:11,867 --> 01:32:14,199
Two telephone calls that Friday--
one from me...

1054
01:32:14,270 --> 01:32:18,331
and another from a pay phone
out Route 180, Pine Glenn outlets.

1055
01:32:18,407 --> 01:32:19,738
Pine Glenn?

1056
01:32:21,043 --> 01:32:24,535
A telephone call from your neighbor.
Nothing.

1057
01:32:30,953 --> 01:32:32,887
Talk to me, Michael.

1058
01:32:34,256 --> 01:32:36,190
What's going on?

1059
01:32:38,494 --> 01:32:40,428
Talk to me.

1060
01:32:48,370 --> 01:32:50,304
Give up the goddamn class.

1061
01:32:56,979 --> 01:32:59,345
I'd like to rent a car
tomorrow morning.

1062
01:32:59,415 --> 01:33:01,781
How early could I pick that up?

1063
01:33:04,420 --> 01:33:06,354
Michael Faraday.

1064
01:33:49,698 --> 01:33:51,097
Oliver Lang, please.

1065
01:33:51,167 --> 01:33:53,567
Mr. Lang is out of the office.
Would you like to leave a message?

1066
01:33:53,636 --> 01:33:55,627
I need to reach him.
This is a business emergency.

1067
01:33:55,704 --> 01:33:58,935
Mr. Lang isn't expected in this morning.

1068
01:33:59,008 --> 01:34:01,408
- I'll call back. Thanks.
- Is there something else--

1069
01:34:01,477 --> 01:34:03,672
No.

1070
01:37:56,712 --> 01:38:01,172
Hey, neighbor, you all right?
What you doin' on this side of town?

1071
01:38:04,119 --> 01:38:06,587
Had to know, didn't ya?
Had to know.

1072
01:38:06,655 --> 01:38:09,215
Couldn't leave your neighbor alone.

1073
01:38:24,206 --> 01:38:26,231
Didn't you check up on me?

1074
01:38:26,308 --> 01:38:28,333
Didn't you?

1075
01:38:28,410 --> 01:38:31,004
Did you really think
we'd leave anything to chance?

1076
01:38:31,079 --> 01:38:33,513
Fifty-one.

1077
01:38:33,582 --> 01:38:36,813
I've got your shadow.
Go ahead. We're still on schedule.

1078
01:38:40,556 --> 01:38:43,286
- You gonna miss your son, Michael?
- Please.

1079
01:38:43,358 --> 01:38:46,384
You've given me no choice!

1080
01:38:46,462 --> 01:38:50,398
You think I wanted this?
I told you you were gonna get him back!

1081
01:38:50,466 --> 01:38:53,902
How am I gonna do that now?
How am I gonna trust you now?

1082
01:38:53,969 --> 01:38:56,961
Where are you taking him?
Where's the bomb?

1083
01:39:00,242 --> 01:39:03,734
I'm a messenger, Michael.
I'm a messenger!

1084
01:39:03,812 --> 01:39:06,246
There's millions of us,
waiting to take up arms...

1085
01:39:06,315 --> 01:39:08,510
ready to spread the word.

1086
01:39:08,584 --> 01:39:09,915
Millions of us!

1087
01:39:09,985 --> 01:39:12,180
The government's
not who you're killing!

1088
01:39:12,254 --> 01:39:15,655
Yes, yes, they'll pay.
They'll pay for their sins...

1089
01:39:15,724 --> 01:39:17,521
- You're killing children !
- their lies, their children.

1090
01:39:17,593 --> 01:39:19,322
- Children die!
- This is war.

1091
01:39:19,394 --> 01:39:21,589
In a war, children die.

1092
01:39:21,663 --> 01:39:23,858
- You're with us!
- No!

1093
01:39:46,688 --> 01:39:49,555
Liberty Two, status.

1094
01:39:50,893 --> 01:39:52,554
Status one, go.

1095
01:39:52,628 --> 01:39:55,722
That's what you stand for.

1096
01:39:55,797 --> 01:39:59,164
You tell them you stand for
blowing up families...

1097
01:39:59,234 --> 01:40:01,168
for orphan sons.

1098
01:40:02,938 --> 01:40:06,567
Your father really kill himself,
you son of a bitch?

1099
01:40:06,642 --> 01:40:08,735
Or is that just one of your
goddamn stories?

1100
01:40:10,312 --> 01:40:13,713
- Call it oft!
- It's for you, Michael.

1101
01:40:13,782 --> 01:40:15,841
- It's for all of us.
- It's not for me. Call it oft!

1102
01:40:16,985 --> 01:40:19,977
Are you happy in your godless,
suburban life?

1103
01:40:20,055 --> 01:40:22,421
Call oft the bomb!

1104
01:40:22,491 --> 01:40:25,324
Call off the fuckin' bomb!

1105
01:40:29,231 --> 01:40:31,358
They sent your wife
to her death.

1106
01:40:31,433 --> 01:40:34,402
Surely you won't be sorry
to see them go.

1107
01:40:41,677 --> 01:40:43,269
You're too late!

1108
01:41:16,645 --> 01:41:18,636
Let's get it done.

1109
01:41:28,857 --> 01:41:30,256
- Agent Carver.
- Listen to me.

1110
01:41:30,325 --> 01:41:34,386
There's a bomb on its way
to your offices. Get everybody out!

1111
01:41:34,463 --> 01:41:36,658
- What's going on?
- It's in a white van.

1112
01:41:36,732 --> 01:41:39,064
A Liberty Delivery Van.
Grant's in there.

1113
01:41:41,637 --> 01:41:43,571
They want the FBI this time!

1114
01:41:43,639 --> 01:41:46,005
Michael, you're breaking up!

1115
01:41:47,409 --> 01:41:49,775
Whit? Shit!

1116
01:41:54,549 --> 01:41:56,847
Come on !

1117
01:42:09,831 --> 01:42:11,526
Security, main gate.

1118
01:43:03,585 --> 01:43:05,314
Out of the way!

1119
01:43:57,139 --> 01:43:59,403
That's the van!

1120
01:43:59,474 --> 01:44:01,965
Stop it!

1121
01:44:06,214 --> 01:44:08,944
- Stop the van!
- Sir, step out of the vehicle!

1122
01:44:09,017 --> 01:44:12,783
- There's a bomb in the van !
- Step out of the vehicle!

1123
01:44:12,854 --> 01:44:15,322
- It's got a goddamn bomb!
- Michael, wait!

1124
01:44:15,390 --> 01:44:18,553
That's the van!
There's a bomb in there!

1125
01:44:18,627 --> 01:44:21,653
- That van was authorized.
- That's the van! Grant's inside!

1126
01:44:21,730 --> 01:44:24,164
It's the noon delivery.

1127
01:44:26,401 --> 01:44:28,665
Grant's in there!
It's got a goddamn bomb!

1128
01:44:38,380 --> 01:44:39,847
Hold your tire!

1129
01:44:55,463 --> 01:44:58,955
- Don't shoot!
- In the van!

1130
01:45:02,671 --> 01:45:06,300
Get everyone out of the building!
There's a bomb in the van !

1131
01:45:12,681 --> 01:45:15,650
- Get him out of the building.
- Check the goddamn van.

1132
01:45:18,720 --> 01:45:21,188
We gotta get everybody out of here.
There's a bomb.

1133
01:45:21,256 --> 01:45:23,190
- It's in there.
- Easy.

1134
01:45:26,561 --> 01:45:28,028
Wait! That's--

1135
01:45:28,096 --> 01:45:30,860
That's not the man.

1136
01:45:30,932 --> 01:45:33,298
- All right.
- Grant!

1137
01:45:34,836 --> 01:45:36,303
Let him go.

1138
01:45:36,371 --> 01:45:38,635
I said, let him go!

1139
01:45:39,641 --> 01:45:42,166
- Back off!
- The van's clean.

1140
01:45:42,244 --> 01:45:44,838
There's nothing in here.

1141
01:45:44,913 --> 01:45:47,848
Go ahead, Michael.

1142
01:46:00,996 --> 01:46:03,396
Michael, it's all clear.

1143
01:46:03,465 --> 01:46:06,332
The guy's authorized to be here.

1144
01:46:06,401 --> 01:46:10,565
We're all authorized to be here.
Everyone except you.

1145
01:46:13,775 --> 01:46:16,835
All right? Come on.

1146
01:46:22,183 --> 01:46:24,378
It's all right.

1147
01:46:39,834 --> 01:46:41,267
Hey, guys!

1148
01:47:00,555 --> 01:47:02,113
Stand by.

1149
01:47:38,660 --> 01:47:40,890
Everyone except you.

1150
01:47:53,575 --> 01:47:55,008
Boom.

1151
01:48:29,477 --> 01:48:32,310
Right now, I'm sort of breathless.

1152
01:48:32,380 --> 01:48:34,814
I've just gotten here,
and there are people lying--

1153
01:48:54,302 --> 01:48:56,770
It looks just like a war zone!

1154
01:49:09,918 --> 01:49:12,614
Officials at this point believe
a bomb went off.

1155
01:49:12,687 --> 01:49:15,247
They're not sure
which floor, how big.

1156
01:49:15,323 --> 01:49:19,885
Obviously, it was massive
to create the kind of devastation--

1157
01:49:54,262 --> 01:49:56,628
Preliminary reports indicate
the bombing was the work...

1158
01:49:56,698 --> 01:50:00,293
of this man, Michael Faraday
of Reston, Virginia.

1159
01:50:00,368 --> 01:50:03,462
A professor of history
at George Washington University--

1160
01:50:03,538 --> 01:50:07,338
Officials will not confirm reports
that the bombing had anything to do...

1161
01:50:07,408 --> 01:50:11,742
with the death of Mr. Faraday's wife,
who had been an FBI agent.

1162
01:50:19,454 --> 01:50:21,888
Students and colleagues both say...

1163
01:50:21,956 --> 01:50:26,450
that Farady's behavior was increasingly
erratic in the weeks leading up--

1164
01:50:26,528 --> 01:50:30,089
He was really intense, you know?
Knew all about these terrorists--

1165
01:50:30,165 --> 01:50:32,292
how they worked, what they wanted.

1166
01:50:32,367 --> 01:50:35,200
He was really into it.
It was my favorite class.

1167
01:50:35,270 --> 01:50:38,330
We went to this field trip once.
It was Copper Creek.

1168
01:50:38,406 --> 01:50:42,570
He practically broke down and started
crying, something about his wife.

1169
01:50:42,644 --> 01:50:45,807
We all sort of knew about it, but
he never really wanted to talk about it.

1170
01:50:48,016 --> 01:50:51,645
Faraday reportedly blamed the Bureau
for its role in his wife's death...

1171
01:50:51,719 --> 01:50:53,311
almost three years ago.

1172
01:50:53,388 --> 01:50:55,481
Specifically, sources
speculate his target...

1173
01:50:55,557 --> 01:51:00,722
may have been Agent Whit Carver, one of
the 184 people to perish in the attack.

1174
01:51:00,795 --> 01:51:04,060
Carver was a partner
of Faraday's wife at Copper Creek...

1175
01:51:04,132 --> 01:51:06,293
and Faraday
may have held him responsible.

1176
01:51:06,367 --> 01:51:10,394
All I know is what he told me
in his office one day after class.

1177
01:51:10,471 --> 01:51:12,962
I'll never forget that.

1178
01:51:13,041 --> 01:51:16,204
He said, "Sweetheart...

1179
01:51:16,277 --> 01:51:19,474
one day those men are going to pay.

1180
01:51:19,547 --> 01:51:22,277
One day those men
are going to burn. "

1181
01:51:32,894 --> 01:51:37,160
Yet all of them described Faraday
as solitary but friendly...

1182
01:51:37,232 --> 01:51:41,293
as a talented professor fascinated
by the American underground...

1183
01:51:41,369 --> 01:51:44,532
and as a loving father
to his ten-year-old son...

1184
01:51:44,606 --> 01:51:46,836
who is now in the care of relatives.

1185
01:51:53,248 --> 01:51:57,344
And so after exhausting hundreds
of thousands of man-hours and leads...

1186
01:51:57,418 --> 01:52:00,216
federal investigators are finally
ready to say...

1187
01:52:00,288 --> 01:52:04,247
that just as in the St. Louis
IRS bombing nearly two years ago...

1188
01:52:04,325 --> 01:52:06,657
this spring's attack on the FBl...

1189
01:52:06,728 --> 01:52:09,219
the worst terrorist strike
in our nation's history...

1190
01:52:09,297 --> 01:52:12,357
was the work of one man
and one man alone.

1191
01:52:17,672 --> 01:52:19,663
Any news yet?

1192
01:52:19,741 --> 01:52:22,801
No. They'll let us know.

1193
01:52:26,080 --> 01:52:28,310
Someplace nice.

1194
01:52:28,383 --> 01:52:29,975
I hope.

1195
01:52:31,419 --> 01:52:33,011
Someplace sate.

1196
01:52:35,456 --> 01:52:37,048
Always.
