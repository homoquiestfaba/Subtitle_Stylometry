00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,192
It means no tip.

182
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:53,366
Come in.
Let's get this over with.

183
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,835
- I'm--
- Paid by the hour, right.

184
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,374
Nice... You should wax.

185
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:02,375
What?

186
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:04,878
Never mind, amuse me.

187
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:08,047
Keep goin'.
Turn this day around.

188
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:09,783
Um, I think there's
a misunderstanding.

189
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:11,985
Yeah, it doesn't look like
you're wearing a g-string.

190
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:14,053
Some stripper you are.

191
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:16,790
I'm not a stripper...

192
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:18,825
I'm your new neighbor.

193
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:22,095
I got this mail by mistake.

194
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:27,267
Sorry.

195
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:40,814
Black briefs.

196
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:42,115
Huh?

197
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:44,784
No g-string.

198
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:47,620
I'm more of
a black briefs kinda guy.

199
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:51,825
Do you want some cake?

200
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:01,134
Cake.

201
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,405
Sounds fun.

202
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,679
Oh...

203
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:16,883
You have no idea
how much I needed that.

204
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,152
Was it on your
birthday wish list?

205
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:20,420
It is now.

206
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,155
I'd say I didn't have
time to wrap it,

207
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:24,290
but that's not
entirely true, is it?

208
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:26,860
And it was just the right size.

209
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:29,095
Good, you can't return it.

210
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:41,441
I'm so glad
you knocked on my door.

211
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:44,477
I'm glad you knocked
on my door in return.

212
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:47,213
I was talking
about my actual door.

213
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:48,781
I wasn't.

214
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,917
[both laughing]

215
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,456
You live next door?

216
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,025
Mmmm, yes, I do.

217
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:01,127
Just renting, but I like it.

218
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,030
So, what brings you
to the gayborhood?

219
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:07,166
Just time for a change.
You lived here long?

220
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,902
Five years.

221
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:11,204
That's commitment.

222
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:13,806
I do believe in commitment.

223
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,341
Good to know.

224
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:18,778
Where are you going?

225
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:21,114
I should get going...

226
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:23,182
Back to my place.

227
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:25,051
You don't have to.

228
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:27,353
I don't want to keep you up.

229
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:30,356
Besides, there's a tennis match
I want to watch.

230
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,458
The exhibition match from Dubai?

231
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:34,394
Yeah, you a tennis fan?

232
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:36,729
- Huge.
- Oh, nice.

233
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:42,468
I have my DVR set to record it.
Should be a really good match.

234
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:45,505
Maybe I should come over,

235
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,074
and watch it with you
in the morning.

236
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:53,179
Maybe you should just stay and
watch it with me in the morning.

237
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:56,749
Deal.

238
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:10,763
[doorbell rings]

239
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,169
Aha! I have to pee.

240
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,272
Come in, Evelyn.
Make yourself at home.

241
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:22,008
Let me tell you about all the
amazing sex I had last night.

242
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:32,118
A strange women just raced
through here to the bathroom.

243
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:34,487
She's not strange,
she's Evelyn.

244
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:37,323
On the other hand,
she's very strange.

245
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,361
Oh, my God,
so much better.

246
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:43,997
Doug?

247
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,465
Yes.

248
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:47,967
There's a strange man
in your bed.

249
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:49,002
I know.

250
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:53,439
I was gonna tell you earlier,
but I had to pee.

251
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:55,875
Just making sure
you knew he was here.

252
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:58,077
- I do.
- Excellent.

253
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:05,551
And...the introductions
would start...

254
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:06,953
Oh, sorry.

255
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:09,489
Evelyn, this is Colton.

256
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:12,158
Colton, this is
my dear friend, Evelyn.

257
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:13,593
Charmed, I'm sure.

258
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:18,865
I would shake your hand,
but I'm sort of naked.

259
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:20,600
Are you?

260
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:28,474
Nice to meet you.

261
00:13:28,508 --> 00:13:29,609
And you.

262
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,445
I'm sure the pleasure
was all Doug's.

263
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:37,150
So, he is...

264
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:39,986
too young for you,
but that's beside the point.

265
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:43,056
Cut it out, Evvy.
He's my--

266
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:44,223
Birthday present.

267
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:46,359
I do take credit cards,
by the way.

268
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:48,227
- You didn't!
- I didn't.

269
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:49,929
Oh, yes, you did, sir.

270
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:51,030
Sir?

271
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:53,966
Thank you for untying me, sir.

272
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,535
This is so not what--

273
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:57,470
Oh, Doug, Doug,
you're a grown man.

274
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,505
You can spend your money
however you like.

275
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:01,641
Just be sure
to give him a big tip.

276
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,276
He's already done that.

277
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:07,380
I like him.

278
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:09,015
He's my neighbor.

279
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:11,651
Whatever turns you on, sweetie,
mmm hmmm.

280
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,119
I should get going.

281
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:18,057
It was...
nice to meet you.

282
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:19,559
And you.

283
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:22,028
Hope we'll be
seeing more of you.

284
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,705
And now we have.

285
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:34,107
Whoo!

286
00:14:34,674 --> 00:14:39,979
Um... Happy Birthday!

287
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:41,581
Thanks.

288
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:44,183
It was yesterday, remember?

289
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:47,120
I remember, I remember every...

290
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:49,422
Oh, shit,
Jaden's still in the car!

291
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:51,023
I gotta run!

292
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:52,225
I love you!

293
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,200
You're terrible, Muriel.

294
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,436
Thank you, sir.

295
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,444
So what did you do?

296
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:12,712
Excuse me?

297
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,480
For your birthday.

298
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:15,715
How'd you know?

299
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,483
It's on your online profile.

300
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:19,185
Did you have a good time?

301
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:22,021
Yeah. Actually, it was...

302
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:23,222
[moans]

303
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,361
Nice, in the end.

304
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:30,496
Hmm...
Your end or his?

305
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:34,600
[breathing heavily]

306
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,037
No comment.

307
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,173
I thought so.

308
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:42,742
You look, shall we say,
very satisfied today.

309
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:46,646
I am. I mean,
I was having a shitty birthday,

310
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:50,716
and then something happened
that just made it feel like,

311
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:55,087
I don't know, like,
turning 40 wasn't so bad.

312
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:58,057
That must have been
some serious sex.

313
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:01,761
I don't know if I'm comfortable
talking about this with you.

314
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,496
Don't worry about it.

315
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:05,565
It's not like
we're exclusive or anything.

316
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:09,235
Did you ask me to go steady
when I wasn't paying attention?

317
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:10,303
It's no big deal.

318
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:12,638
You're dating other guys,
I'm dating other guys.

319
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:14,207
You're dating other guys?

320
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:18,110
Well, I would
if I could find them.

321
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:22,682
You know, if you hadn't
slammed into my car that day--

322
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:25,051
I barely bumped into you.

323
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:26,519
I almost had whiplash.

324
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:28,521
Oh, you almost had a headache.

325
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:29,388
Potato, po-tah-to.

326
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:31,123
You were parked
in front of my house,

327
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:33,159
and I was barely going
five miles an hour.

328
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:34,560
That's not the point.

329
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:36,229
If you hadn't hit me,

330
00:16:36,262 --> 00:16:37,663
we wouldn't
have started talking,

331
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:40,700
and I would have never had
the courage to ask you out.

332
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:43,436
Here's to fate.

333
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:46,539
And here's to being rear-ended.

334
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:47,807
[glasses clink]

335
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:51,110
So...

336
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:53,813
Why were you parked
in front of my house?

337
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,582
House hunting.

338
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:59,819
You never mentioned
you were house hunting.

339
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,687
You never asked.

340
00:17:01,721 --> 00:17:03,422
That's odd.

341
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:05,825
- That you never asked?
- Yeah.

342
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:11,264
You were being very polite.

343
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:13,199
Polite? How?

344
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,342
You weren't talking
with your mouth full.

345
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:27,113
Oh, yeah.

346
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:34,687
You should be on the welcoming
committee for the neighborhood.

347
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,457
Made me feel quite at home.

348
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:39,625
Good.

349
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:54,874
So, um,
did you find a place yet?

350
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,208
Not yet.

351
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:58,144
Staying with relatives
for a bit.

352
00:17:59,345 --> 00:18:02,648
I still can't believe
that you were...married.

353
00:18:02,682 --> 00:18:04,717
And...you have a son.

354
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,352
Two sons.

355
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:08,854
Oh, yeah, I forgot, wow.

356
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:11,691
Well, I don't talk about
my second son much.

357
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:13,259
Why?

358
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,896
He didn't take
my coming out very well.

359
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,164
What'd he do?

360
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:20,666
No, you can't be gay!
You're my daddy!

361
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,437
Ooh, yikes.

362
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:27,473
He was always
a little emotional.

363
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,409
Did he ever accept it?

364
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:33,179
I hate you!
You've ruined my life!

365
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:35,881
Not yet...

366
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:37,450
Someday.

367
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:40,753
But your other son's
OK with it, right?

368
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:42,955
Definitely.

369
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:45,891
But that's another story
for another day.

370
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:50,896
Read me a bedtime story, Daddy?

371
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:54,667
No, don't do that.

372
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,669
Why, you gonna spank me?

373
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:58,904
I'll spank you.

374
00:18:58,938 --> 00:19:00,573
[both laughing]

375
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:03,509
You sure you don't want
to come out with me?

376
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:05,811
Ugh, that club
makes me feel so old.

377
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:06,946
But you are old.

378
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,614
Not that much older than you,

379
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:09,915
according to
your driver's license.

380
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:11,951
Clerical error at the DMV.

381
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,819
I'm not a day over 29.

382
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:15,187
What?!

383
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:18,424
I'll get you for that, my ugly.

384
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:21,427
Good Lord, you are gay.

385
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,596
Yeah, I am,
and why should you feel old?

386
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:25,331
You're dating a twink.

387
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:27,266
Oh, that's right.

388
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,468
You're also dating an elder.

389
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:33,739
Um, first of all, Colton is 30 -
that is hardly a twink.

390
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:36,809
30? I throw them back
if they're a day over 25.

391
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,344
Oh, yeah,
and that works for you?

392
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:39,979
Totally works for me.

393
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,714
OK, well what about
the time that we hooked up?

394
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:45,351
OK. A - I was drunk.

395
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:48,988
B - you were
a lot younger then.

396
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:52,892
And C - I was really drunk.

397
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,994
Whatever.
OK, and Jacob.

398
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,863
He's 50,
not close to an elder.

399
00:19:57,897 --> 00:20:02,001
50?
Is he all wrinkly and shit?

400
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,003
Not that it matters, but no.

401
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,938
He's in good shape.

402
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:07,740
For a man his age.

403
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:09,742
Don't you dare
make a Viagra joke.

404
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:11,710
Oh, do you need some?
I have some extra.

405
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:12,578
Why do you have Viagra?

406
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:14,447
From that orgy
I went to last month.

407
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,749
Oh, my gosh,
you, my friend, are a whore.

408
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:18,484
You're so sweet.

409
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:23,355
Oh, big question -
underwear, yes or no?

410
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:25,825
Um, I'm gonna say yes.

411
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:27,293
No it is.

412
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:33,432
Why do you...date--

413
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:37,303
Why is it you're OK
with dating younger men

414
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:40,039
as opposed to older men?

415
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,741
Because younger men
keep me young.

416
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:45,311
Or at least,
they make me feel young.

417
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:49,482
And, really,
isn't that what it's all about?

418
00:20:49,682 --> 00:20:50,716
Anyway...

419
00:20:56,122 --> 00:20:57,923
Oh, that reminds me.

420
00:20:57,957 --> 00:21:00,059
There's a bottle of wine
for you in the kitchen.

421
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,594
Happy Birthday, bud.

422
00:21:02,962 --> 00:21:04,663
[knocking]

423
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:06,699
That was fast.

424
00:21:11,971 --> 00:21:14,473
I told you I take credit cards.

425
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:17,510
What? Oh...
I was waiting for pizza.

426
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:20,679
Well, how about
a home-cooked meal instead?

427
00:21:22,815 --> 00:21:25,484
I can hardly tell
that you just moved in.

428
00:21:25,518 --> 00:21:27,419
The owners wanted
to rent it furnished,

429
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,788
and who am I
to turn away furniture?

430
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:31,924
Never say no to ottomans,
they get very upset.

431
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,661
Bone...

432
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:36,929
...appetite.

433
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,531
Classy.

434
00:21:38,564 --> 00:21:39,865
I try.

435
00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:40,799
Red or white?

436
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,701
Well, actually,
I'm one-sixteenth Cherokee

437
00:21:42,735 --> 00:21:44,703
on my mother's side,
but mostly white.

438
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:46,572
I meant the wine.

439
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:47,740
White.

440
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:48,974
Coming right up.

441
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:52,111
It smells amazing.

442
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,612
It's the bacon.

443
00:21:54,914 --> 00:21:56,715
Is the bacon hiding?

444
00:21:56,749 --> 00:21:59,752
Bacon and sun-dried tomatoes
stuffed inside the chicken,

445
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:01,854
a bacon-infused
vinaigrette in the salad,

446
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:05,057
and the bread -
is a bacon-Gruyere scone.

447
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:08,027
So...you like bacon.

448
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,362
I like bacon.

449
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:13,732
Did you put bacon in the wine?

450
00:22:13,766 --> 00:22:16,435
Yeah, I dipped the rims
in bacon fat.

451
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:17,736
No, you did not.

452
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,705
I did not...

453
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:21,040
But I might someday.

454
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:25,377
[door slams]

455
00:22:25,778 --> 00:22:27,546
You could try knocking.

456
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:30,149
What are you...?

457
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,016
We're having dinner.

458
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:32,751
This is the guy
I was telling you about;

459
00:22:32,785 --> 00:22:34,386
he lives next door.

460
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:39,491
That's where I...
I mean, I...

461
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:43,062
almost walked right up
to the house next door.

462
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:46,432
Totally not paying attention.

463
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:48,167
Funny, huh?

464
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,868
Hilarious.

465
00:22:52,805 --> 00:22:55,074
And apparently,
I learned nothing

466
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:57,209
from meeting your friend
the other morning.

467
00:22:57,243 --> 00:22:58,978
Introductions all around.

468
00:22:59,011 --> 00:23:00,646
This is Doug, he...

469
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:01,780
Lives next door.

470
00:23:01,814 --> 00:23:04,516
Yeah, good memory.

471
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:07,519
Doug, this is Jacob, my father.

472
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:09,021
Your--

473
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,489
Father.

474
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,658
Your father?

475
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:13,759
My father.

476
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,928
His father?

477
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:16,929
His father.

478
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:18,664
Well, that's just fucked up.

479
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:19,698
I know.

480
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:21,667
You're dating a father and son?

481
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,636
Well, that just sounds
dirtier than it is.

482
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:26,605
Well, just how dirty is it?

483
00:23:26,639 --> 00:23:27,940
It's not!

484
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:32,177
I'm dating two men
who happen to be fath...

485
00:23:32,211 --> 00:23:33,579
Oh, Christ.

486
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,548
Wow, that sounds bad.

487
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:37,883
Does this happen a lot
in the gay world?

488
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,018
No.

489
00:23:39,051 --> 00:23:41,787
'Cause I've seen some
mother-daughter lesbian porn,

490
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,822
and that was pretty damn hot.

491
00:23:43,856 --> 00:23:44,957
Please stop talking.

492
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:48,794
So, um,
what did the son, uh...

493
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:50,596
- Colton.
-
{end-italic}Yeah, Colton.

494
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:52,097
What did he say
when he found out?

495
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:53,365
Well...

496
00:23:53,399 --> 00:23:56,101
I'll put that in the kitchen.
You two get to know each other.

497
00:23:58,137 --> 00:23:58,971
That's your son?

498
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:01,006
You didn't tell me
you had a gay son.

499
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:01,940
You didn't ask.

500
00:24:01,974 --> 00:24:04,109
I've got to start
asking more questions.

501
00:24:04,143 --> 00:24:06,011
What are you two
whispering about?

502
00:24:06,045 --> 00:24:07,646
How much we adore you, Son.

503
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,847
That's sweet.

504
00:24:08,881 --> 00:24:10,649
See any family resemblances?

505
00:24:10,683 --> 00:24:12,151
Now that you mention it.

506
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:13,986
Colton, can you get
me a glass of wine?

507
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:15,087
Sure.

508
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,891
I don't want to hear anything
about our...resemblances.

509
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:20,192
- Fine.
- Fine.

510
00:24:20,893 --> 00:24:22,761
You're not staying, are you?

511
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:23,996
I live here.

512
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:25,698
Well, that's just awkward.

513
00:24:25,731 --> 00:24:28,033
So you're the one that
thought my son was a stripper?

514
00:24:28,067 --> 00:24:30,035
It was an honest mistake.

515
00:24:30,069 --> 00:24:31,303
And sleeping with him?

516
00:24:31,337 --> 00:24:32,905
That was on purpose.

517
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:35,007
What?

518
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,575
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

519
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,945
Is there any more chicken?

520
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,980
Don't worry,
I'll eat it in my room.

521
00:24:42,014 --> 00:24:43,248
Yes, I will get you that.

522
00:24:44,917 --> 00:24:46,318
What do we tell him?

523
00:24:46,352 --> 00:24:47,753
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

524
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:48,887
Tell him nothing.

525
00:24:48,921 --> 00:24:51,023
He's always been competitive.
It runs in the family.

526
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:52,725
But this is not a competition.

527
00:24:52,758 --> 00:24:53,926
It will be soon.

528
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:58,630
You boys have fun.

529
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:01,200
I'm going to, uh,
eat this in my room,

530
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:03,035
which is ten feet that way -

531
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:04,837
behind those thin walls.

532
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,538
In case anybody needs me.

533
00:25:08,774 --> 00:25:10,042
Night, Dad.

534
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:12,277
It was nice meeting you.

535
00:25:12,311 --> 00:25:14,012
Yes, wasn't it?

536
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:20,652
And you continued
your date with Colton

537
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:22,321
like nothing had happened?

538
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:25,657
I tried, what else
was I supposed to do?

539
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:27,926
Move out of the neighborhood
due to sheer embarrassment.

540
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,795
That thought crossed my mind.

541
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:31,964
Tell me you didn't
stay over with Jacob there?

542
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:34,933
I did not stay over
with Jacob there.

543
00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:36,869
I can't stay over
with your father here.

544
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:37,970
He won't mind.

545
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:39,805
Did I mention he's gay, too?

546
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:42,808
I know.
I mean, no, I just...

547
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:44,276
kind of figured it out.

548
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:46,245
Really? How?

549
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:48,113
Well... um...

550
00:25:48,147 --> 00:25:49,915
Did he hit on you?

551
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:51,750
No. No!

552
00:25:51,784 --> 00:25:53,986
Of course not!

553
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:55,821
I'm kidding around.

554
00:25:56,755 --> 00:25:58,657
I mean, how weird
would that be, right?

555
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:00,359
So weird.

556
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:02,361
Completely weird.

557
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,129
Bizarro weird!

558
00:26:04,997 --> 00:26:07,733
Then...stay.

559
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,701
I should get home.

560
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:12,104
What, beat the traffic?

561
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:13,272
Exactly.

562
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:16,708
That's a joke,
'cause you live next door.

563
00:26:19,845 --> 00:26:21,146
Next time?

564
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:23,215
Next time.

565
00:26:25,851 --> 00:26:27,352
So you slept alone,

566
00:26:27,386 --> 00:26:28,554
while the two men
you're sleeping with

567
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:31,423
slept next to each other
in the house that they share.

568
00:26:31,457 --> 00:26:33,725
That seems to be the case.

569
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:35,861
I'm gonna need a flowchart
to keep up with this.

570
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:38,263
So do you have
a Daddy complex,

571
00:26:38,297 --> 00:26:39,398
or does Colton?

572
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,300
How do you know
about Daddy complexes?

573
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:43,735
I'm a therapist.
I deal with a lot of strippers.

574
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:46,371
No...
Nobody has a daddy complex.

575
00:26:46,405 --> 00:26:48,407
Does Jacob like it
when you call him Daddy?

576
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,675
No.

577
00:26:50,142 --> 00:26:51,143
Oh, my God!

578
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:52,845
You actually call him Daddy?

579
00:26:52,878 --> 00:26:55,013
It was a joke.

580
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:56,415
Does Colton call you Daddy?

581
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:59,418
No! Nobody calls
anybody Daddy, OK?

582
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,019
Except for Colton and Jacob.

583
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:02,855
Because, well, he is his daddy.

584
00:27:02,888 --> 00:27:05,791
Can we...say father instead?

585
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:08,293
The daddy stuff
is kinda creeping me out.

586
00:27:08,327 --> 00:27:11,697
Hey, have you told
our father about this?

587
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,065
I'm hanging up now.

588
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:18,904
Hey.

589
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:21,306
Sorry about your birthday
thing the other night.

590
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,908
Here.

591
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:24,810
What does it mean
that every person I know

592
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:26,345
got me wine for my birthday?

593
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:27,946
That you're an alcoholic?

594
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,448
I'm not an alcoholic.

595
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,083
Do you drink at home alone?

596
00:27:32,284 --> 00:27:34,286
[snoring]

597
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:36,154
Yeah, sometimes.

598
00:27:36,188 --> 00:27:38,457
Classic signs of an alcoholic.

599
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,193
But wait, I live alone,
so of course I drink alone.

600
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:43,061
First step is the hardest.

601
00:27:43,095 --> 00:27:44,897
Apparently the only steps
I need are the ones

602
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:47,032
leading right
to the local liquor store.

603
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:48,467
Them's the spirits!

604
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,168
Thanks for your support.

605
00:27:50,202 --> 00:27:52,938
No, it's the best
liquor store around here.

606
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:56,375
Them's The Spirits -
it's the name of the store.

607
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:59,244
Oh, OK.
Good to know.

608
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:02,180
Hey, do you have a minute?

609
00:28:06,385 --> 00:28:07,486
We should go to lunch.

610
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,987
- Oh, God!
- What?

611
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:10,255
Are you firing me?

612
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:11,924
Why would you
think I'm firing you?

613
00:28:11,957 --> 00:28:14,026
You always take people to
lunch when you're firing them.

614
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:15,093
I do?

615
00:28:15,127 --> 00:28:16,795
That vegan place
down the street...

616
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:18,130
You said that people
won't have the energy

617
00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:19,798
to fight back
without any protein.

618
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:22,000
- I said that?
- A little bit.

619
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:23,502
I'm not firing you.

620
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:26,838
I just want to congratulate you
for landing that new client.

621
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:28,874
Oh, that. Thanks.

622
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:30,275
I'm just glad
we could fit him in.

623
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:31,843
I was looking at the schedule;

624
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:33,912
we are really
booked up this month.

625
00:28:33,946 --> 00:28:36,248
All thanks
to your brilliant idea.

626
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:38,216
Which brilliant idea
are you talking about?

627
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:39,985
You're gonna have
to narrow that one down.

628
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:42,321
The senior citizens
Intro to Pilates class.

629
00:28:42,354 --> 00:28:43,822
It's really taken off.

630
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:46,024
You really have a grasp
on that demographic.

631
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:47,893
- No I don't.
- Sure, you do.

632
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:50,362
You have this sense for
what really gets them excited.

633
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:53,332
Yeah, but I can relate to
the younger generation, too.

634
00:28:53,365 --> 00:28:55,434
Of course you can, mister.

635
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:57,169
So can I.

636
00:28:57,202 --> 00:28:59,871
After all, Terry is three
whole years younger than I am.

637
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:02,274
That's like 20 in gay years.

638
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:03,942
It's not that big.

639
00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:05,444
Yes, it is.

640
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:07,913
Why do you think
I stay with him?

641
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:09,915
It's big.

642
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:11,650
That reminds me...

643
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:15,454
We need to schedule our
sexual harassment training.

644
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:17,055
[whispers]
You need to go.

645
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:18,890
I'll make a note of it.

646
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:23,562
This feels good.

647
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,564
Mmmm...

648
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,065
Good.

649
00:29:27,566 --> 00:29:29,534
Great, even.

650
00:29:30,569 --> 00:29:32,104
Great!

651
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:35,407
You're not making this easy.

652
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,945
That's because you're making it
very, very hard.

653
00:29:41,213 --> 00:29:43,048
Be serious a second.

654
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:45,550
OK, serious, go.

655
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:51,089
What I'm trying to say is...
I like this.

656
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:53,492
I like spending time with you.

657
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:55,994
I like you, Doug.

658
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,598
I like you, Colton.

659
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,600
I know haven't
known each other that long,

660
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,936
but I think we have
a connection here.

661
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,204
Me too.

662
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,608
And I was hoping that we could
see a lot more of each other.

663
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,910
Kinda unavoidable.

664
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:13,311
We're neighbors.

665
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:17,416
You know what I mean.

666
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:21,520
You're not asking me
to go steady, are you?

667
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:24,556
Jeez, sounds like
something my dad would say.

668
00:30:25,457 --> 00:30:29,127
Oh, I didn't mean
that in a bad way.

669
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:31,663
Is that how you see me -
some sort of father figure?

670
00:30:31,697 --> 00:30:34,966
Jesus, you're not old enough
to be a father figure.

671
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,101
Why?

672
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:38,470
Is that something that
bothers you, our age difference?

673
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:41,073
No, I think you're
very mature for your age.

674
00:30:41,106 --> 00:30:43,642
It is possible to be
a 30-year-old gay man,

675
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:47,112
and not be obsessed
with Lady Gag Me.

676
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:48,246
That's a relief.

677
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:49,948
[clears throat]

678
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:52,117
But I, um...

679
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:55,220
I am seeing other people.

680
00:30:56,455 --> 00:30:59,091
One other person,
to be precise.

681
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:02,894
That's cool.

682
00:31:04,296 --> 00:31:09,034
We'll play it by ear,
just see what happens.

683
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:13,538
Oh, my God!

684
00:31:14,139 --> 00:31:16,174
Where did you learn to do that?

685
00:31:17,309 --> 00:31:19,444
Saw it in one of those
sex manuals I read

686
00:31:19,478 --> 00:31:21,279
when I first came out.

687
00:31:21,313 --> 00:31:25,317
Never been with anybody flexible
enough to do it with before.

688
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,718
Pilates...

689
00:31:26,752 --> 00:31:29,020
It makes all the difference.

690
00:31:31,123 --> 00:31:32,624
So, when did you come out?

691
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:36,261
- Officially?
- Officially.

692
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,030
Eight years ago.

693
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:41,299
And unofficially?

694
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:44,069
I guess I always knew,
I just didn't want to face it.

695
00:31:45,704 --> 00:31:48,340
So what pushed you out
after all those years?

696
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:51,176
Actually, it was Colton.

697
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:53,211
Really?

698
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:56,314
It's not like he knew
and encouraged me,

699
00:31:56,348 --> 00:31:57,415
nothing like that.

700
00:31:57,449 --> 00:31:58,750
Then what?

701
00:31:58,784 --> 00:32:02,687
It was watching him grow up
100 percent comfortable

702
00:32:02,721 --> 00:32:05,190
with who he is.

703
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:07,325
I learned a lot from him.

704
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:09,227
Did he come out early?

705
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:12,264
He was one of those kids
you always knew was gay.

706
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:14,599
All the stereotypes were there.

707
00:32:14,633 --> 00:32:17,636
His mom says his afterbirth
was filled with glitter.

708
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:19,271
[laughs]

709
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,440
That's definitely gay.

710
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:29,181
I really loved
watching him grow up,

711
00:32:29,214 --> 00:32:31,316
seeing him become his own man.

712
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:34,085
And it gave me the courage
to do it myself.

713
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,655
And your wife?

714
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:38,256
She knew.

715
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,225
Or at least, she suspected.

716
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:41,626
We were
best friends in college,

717
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,161
got married when
she got pregnant,

718
00:32:43,195 --> 00:32:45,597
did everything we
were supposed to do.

719
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:48,333
And luckily we're still friends.

720
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:50,235
Did she remarry?

721
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:51,703

Well, you did
a great job raising Colton.

727
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,592
We have to tell him.

- Right.

Could you do me a favor and
call me if you see my father?

735
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:36,548
He didn't come home last night,
he's not answering his phone.

house before, right?

a way to tell him.

I always have been.

901
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,014
I know, but still.

902
00:40:50,048 --> 00:40:53,184
Have you had sex with a dude
just to see if you liked it?

903
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:55,887
- No.
- Exactly.

904
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,056
Not that there's
anything wrong with that.

905
00:40:58,089 --> 00:40:59,590
Can I get back to my story now?

906
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:00,692
Please do.

907
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:04,162
Anyway, you've known me almost
as long as you've known her.

908
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:06,531
We all live in the same town.

909
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:09,834
And yet, you never bring
your different friends together.

910
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:11,302
Yes, I do.

911
00:41:11,336 --> 00:41:12,603
I tried.

912
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:15,306
My birthday,
when you were...sick.

913
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:17,909
Oh, right... You did.

914
00:41:17,942 --> 00:41:20,178
You know, you tried,
good point.

915
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:23,581
You failed miserably,
as you so often do.

916
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:24,949
Not helping.

917
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,718
I'm trying to help.

918
00:41:28,186 --> 00:41:31,789
You just like to
have things in their place.

919
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:34,692
You have your employees at work,

920
00:41:34,726 --> 00:41:36,294
who you order around,

921
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,129
which I know
you secretly like to do.

922
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:40,331
- I do not.
- Yes, you do.

923
00:41:40,365 --> 00:41:42,333
And work gives you that.

924
00:41:42,367 --> 00:41:45,770
And you have me,
for when you want to go dancing

925
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:49,974
or get fashion advice
on your pathetic wardrobe.

926
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,676
And you hang out with Evelyn

927
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:53,711
when you want to see
how the breeders are living,

928
00:41:53,745 --> 00:41:57,782
or get fashion advice
on your pathetic wardrobe.

929
00:41:57,815 --> 00:42:00,017
You gave me this tie, FYI.

930
00:42:00,051 --> 00:42:04,956
Oh, honey...
it was a joke.

931
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:06,991
Bow ties are cool.

932
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:08,726
Are they, though?

933
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,863
The only time I've ever
approved of your wardrobe

934
00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:13,331
was on that cruise,

935
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:15,666
when you coordinated
your cock rings

936
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:16,768
with your swimsuits.

937
00:42:16,801 --> 00:42:18,770
[chuckles]
Well, who doesn't do that?

938
00:42:18,803 --> 00:42:21,372
Oh, you'd be surprised.

939
00:42:21,406 --> 00:42:23,608
Back to the subject at hand.

940
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:26,210
Everyone has friends that
do different things for them.

941
00:42:26,244 --> 00:42:30,081
You have several of us,
and you're lucky to have us.

942
00:42:31,182 --> 00:42:33,818
And we do have
one thing in common.

943
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:34,819
Bitchiness.

944
00:42:34,852 --> 00:42:36,220
You.

945
00:42:36,254 --> 00:42:39,223
So, yeah,
bitchiness actually covers it.

946
00:42:39,257 --> 00:42:40,825
Thanks a lot.

947
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:44,962
I just--
I hope that your lovers

948
00:42:44,996 --> 00:42:47,231
don't start getting
all competitive.

949
00:42:47,265 --> 00:42:48,966
Not gonna happen.

950
00:42:51,035 --> 00:42:54,272
By the way, I made
plans for dinner tonight.

951
00:42:54,305 --> 00:42:57,942
Picnic in the park,
and a walk around the lake.

952
00:42:57,975 --> 00:43:00,111
- Mmmm.
- Sound good?

953
00:43:00,144 --> 00:43:01,879
Can't wait.

954
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:09,220
I made dinner
reservations for tomorrow night.

955
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:12,857
The new Italian place downtown -
supposed to be fabulous.

956
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:14,692
Mmmm, can't wait.

957
00:43:15,326 --> 00:43:18,129
I got us tickets for that
concert you were talking about.

958
00:43:18,162 --> 00:43:19,430
I thought it was sold out.

959
00:43:19,464 --> 00:43:20,932
I pulled some strings.

960
00:43:20,965 --> 00:43:22,033
Mmmm...

961
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:24,902
Can't wait.

962
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:28,005
I got us two tickets to the
philharmonic Saturday night.

963
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:30,208
Front orchestra.
Beethoven's Ninth.

964
00:43:30,241 --> 00:43:33,010
His ninth seat,
in the front orchestra?

965
00:43:33,044 --> 00:43:35,847
His ninth symphony, philistine.

966
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,715
[chuckles]
Can't wait.

967
00:43:38,082 --> 00:43:40,751
Don't forget we're playing
tennis this afternoon.

968
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:43,354
Don't forget we have tickets
to the tennis tournament

969
00:43:43,387 --> 00:43:45,189
at Indian Wells this weekend.

970
00:43:45,223 --> 00:43:49,026
I'm busy this weekend,
but next weekend I'm free.

971
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:50,161
Super.

972
00:43:50,194 --> 00:43:51,729
'Cause I booked us at that

973
00:43:51,762 --> 00:43:54,365
amazing little resort
in Palm Springs.

974
00:43:54,398 --> 00:43:57,335
You know, the one in
that movie we just watched?

975
00:43:57,368 --> 00:43:59,871
That's awesome!

976
00:43:59,904 --> 00:44:04,809
And unlike the movie, this one
really is clothing optional.

977
00:44:04,842 --> 00:44:06,944
Oh, I can't wait.

978
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:10,181
The weekend after next?

979
00:44:10,214 --> 00:44:12,183
No, I don't have plans.

980
00:44:12,216 --> 00:44:13,317
You do now.

981
00:44:13,351 --> 00:44:16,487
I booked us a suite at
my favorite hotel in Las Vegas.

982
00:44:16,521 --> 00:44:19,457
Vegas?
I'm not much of a gambler.

983
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,058
That's OK.

984
00:44:21,092 --> 00:44:22,827
We don't ever have
to leave the room.

985
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,229
Can't wait.

986
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:29,166
I'm exhausted.

987
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,737
Too much work, or too much sex?

988
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:34,505
Too much of everything.

989
00:44:34,539 --> 00:44:40,211
Traveling, concerts,
dinners out, dinners in,
clubs, parties.

990
00:44:40,244 --> 00:44:43,781
You name it, they have tried it.

991
00:44:43,814 --> 00:44:47,251
And I'm supposed to go to
Vegas this weekend with Jacob.

992
00:44:47,285 --> 00:44:48,886
Question:

993
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:51,756
Did the last restaurant
you go to

994
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:55,459
have crayons so you
could draw on the menu?

995
00:44:55,493 --> 00:44:56,727
No.

996
00:44:56,761 --> 00:45:01,165
Then don't complain to me about
being forced to go to Las Vegas.

997
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:02,099
OK?

998
00:45:02,133 --> 00:45:04,235
Where's that delightfully
well-mannered,

999
00:45:04,268 --> 00:45:06,837
so polite son of yours?

1000
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:10,508
Playdate at the park...

1001
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:13,544
It took us three months
to set it up.

1002
00:45:13,578 --> 00:45:17,148
The parents are very wealthy.

1003
00:45:17,181 --> 00:45:19,417
And why are you whispering?

1004
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:23,120
Because that's what you do when
you talk about wealthy people.

1005
00:45:23,154 --> 00:45:25,256
Are you afraid
they're gonna hear you?

1006
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:26,424
Yes.

1007
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:31,162
Well, why don't you
just tell them to back off?

1008
00:45:31,195 --> 00:45:33,297
Your child's playdate's
wealthy parents?

1009
00:45:33,331 --> 00:45:35,866
No, your lovers.

1010
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,468
I don't want to.

1011
00:45:38,202 --> 00:45:40,204
I just want...

1012
00:45:41,038 --> 00:45:43,040
I want...

1013
00:45:43,975 --> 00:45:45,376
What?

1014
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:46,978
I want...

1015
00:45:47,011 --> 00:45:49,547
Jesús H. Christo!
Use your grownup words.

1016
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,848
If I knew what I wanted

1017
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:52,450
I wouldn't be
in this predicament.

1018
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:54,385
Well, that's true.

1019
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:58,356
And 25 points for the use
of the word predicament.

1020
00:45:58,389 --> 00:46:00,191
But you know what they say.

1021
00:46:00,224 --> 00:46:01,993
No, what do they say?

1022
00:46:02,026 --> 00:46:05,129
You can't have a predicament,

1023
00:46:05,162 --> 00:46:07,465
without a big dick
in the middle.

1024
00:46:07,498 --> 00:46:09,433
- They say that?
- Yes, they do.

1025
00:46:09,467 --> 00:46:10,935
- Who says that?
- Everyone.

1026
00:46:10,968 --> 00:46:14,138
T-shirts, bumper stickers,
license plates.

1027
00:46:15,473 --> 00:46:18,275
You have been
no help at all, thank you.

1028
00:46:18,309 --> 00:46:20,177
Want some wine?

1029
00:46:20,211 --> 00:46:22,980
It's in Mommy's
special sippy cup.

1030
00:46:26,951 --> 00:46:28,452
That is not wine!

1031
00:46:28,486 --> 00:46:30,087
[giggles]

1032
00:46:37,662 --> 00:46:40,464
Vegas looked a lot bigger
in the pictures.

1033
00:46:40,498 --> 00:46:42,266
I wanted to surprise you.

1034
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:43,901
Surprise.

1035
00:46:43,934 --> 00:46:45,403
So no slot machines?

1036
00:46:48,606 --> 00:46:50,274
Vegas would have been fun,

1037
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:53,044
but I thought this would be
a little more intimate.

1038
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:58,949
But I brought clothes
to go out at night.

1039
00:46:58,983 --> 00:47:02,319
You can still go out at night -
to get firewood.

1040
00:47:02,353 --> 00:47:04,488
You brought me up here
to get you wood?

1041
00:47:04,522 --> 00:47:06,323
That's one way of putting it.

1042
00:47:06,357 --> 00:47:07,625
What's another way?

1043
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:10,361
I wanted to keep you
on your toes.

1044
00:47:10,394 --> 00:47:12,496
How about on my knees?

1045
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:14,031
Even better.

1046
00:47:20,037 --> 00:47:22,973
So, you rented this place
for the whole weekend.

1047
00:47:23,007 --> 00:47:24,909
I didn't rent it;
I own it.

1048
00:47:24,942 --> 00:47:26,377
You own it?

1049
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:28,212
Every square inch.

1050
00:47:28,245 --> 00:47:32,183
I can't believe you own
a cabin in the mountains.

1051
00:47:32,216 --> 00:47:34,118
We bought it years ago.

1052
00:47:34,151 --> 00:47:37,121
Well, I love it.

1053
00:47:37,154 --> 00:47:39,957
- It's quaint.
- Thank you.

1054
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:42,526
It's very...old fashioned.

1055
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,261
I think so.

1056
00:47:44,295 --> 00:47:45,563
It's very you.

1057
00:47:45,596 --> 00:47:47,465
You can shut up now.

1058
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:50,067
That's the boys' bedroom.

1059
00:47:50,101 --> 00:47:51,268
Sorry...

1060
00:47:51,302 --> 00:47:54,305
I forgot we aren't going to
mention Colton this weekend.

1061
00:47:54,338 --> 00:47:56,006
Listen, I shouldn't
have said that.

1062
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,541
You can talk about
whatever you want.

1063
00:47:57,575 --> 00:47:59,143
He's your son.

1064
00:47:59,176 --> 00:48:00,277
Deal.

1065
00:48:00,311 --> 00:48:03,013
That is the small bedroom,
twin beds.

1066
00:48:03,047 --> 00:48:05,683
Please tell me
there's a bigger bedroom.

1067
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:07,218
There's a bigger bedroom.

1068
00:48:07,251 --> 00:48:10,054
- With a bigger bed?
- With a bigger bed.

1069
00:48:10,087 --> 00:48:11,288
Tell me where.

1070
00:48:11,322 --> 00:48:13,090
End of the hallway,
past the bathroom.

1071
00:48:13,124 --> 00:48:14,225
Lead the way.

1072
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,570
Just what I need -
peace and qui...

1073
00:48:26,604 --> 00:48:28,072
Hmm.

1074
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:32,576
Whoo, peace and quiet,
and a shower.

1075
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:39,250
[door closes]

1076
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,392
You heard that, right?

just in case.

00:48:53,631 --> 00:48:54,698
Good idea.

any break-ins up here?

taken a shower before?

This is hilarious.

1123
00:51:24,615 --> 00:51:25,616
Of course, I want to know!

Fine. We were just about to--

I don't want to know.

Fine!

It's what you and Karen did
for your last anniversary.

What are you doing here?

I could ask you the same thing!

to be in Vegas!

I thought I'd show
Doug the cabin.

1135
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:52,710
I wanted to come the cabin
while you were out of town.

1136
00:51:52,743 --> 00:51:54,244
Where's your car, anyway?

1137
00:51:54,278 --> 00:51:55,846
I parked it around back.

1138
00:51:57,414 --> 00:52:00,384
And can we please
put some clothes on!

1139
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:04,621
Can I use this as
a case study for my patients?

1140
00:52:04,655 --> 00:52:05,689
No!

1141
00:52:05,723 --> 00:52:07,458
You're not supposed to be here!

1142
00:52:07,491 --> 00:52:09,927
Yu were supposed to be spending
the weekend with your friends!

1143
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,095
They bailed on me!

1144
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:13,530
Besides, you know I come
to the cabin when I'm upset!

1145
00:52:13,564 --> 00:52:14,898
I didn't think you
were that upset!

1146
00:52:14,932 --> 00:52:17,835
- Of course, I'm upset!
- Why?

1147
00:52:17,868 --> 00:52:19,603
Because!

1148
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:22,172

is fucking my boyfriend.

1149
00:52:24,308 --> 00:52:26,844
And my boyfriend's
fucking my father.

1150
00:52:29,313 --> 00:52:31,415
Oh...that.

1151
00:52:32,583 --> 00:52:35,753
Look...
Clearly this is all my fault.

1152
00:52:35,786 --> 00:52:37,688
No, it's not.

1153
00:52:37,721 --> 00:52:38,856
Of course, it is.

1154
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:40,224
You can't blame him.

1155
00:52:40,257 --> 00:52:41,291
Why not?

1156
00:52:41,325 --> 00:52:42,693
Yeah, why not?

1157
00:52:42,726 --> 00:52:44,595
I mean, I am
the one that started

1158
00:52:44,628 --> 00:52:46,263
seeing you both
at the same time.

1159
00:52:46,296 --> 00:52:47,831
You couldn't put
two and two together?

1160
00:52:47,865 --> 00:52:48,832
Was I supposed to ask

1161
00:52:48,866 --> 00:52:51,969
if your gay father
lived in the neighborhood?

1162
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:54,972
Because that doesn't come up
in normal conversation.

1163
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:56,440
Sorry.

1164
00:53:00,778 --> 00:53:03,380
Can't you understand
what I see in each of you?

1165
00:53:05,983 --> 00:53:07,451
I can see it.

1166
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:11,522
I guess I can...
Even though he's old.

1167
00:53:11,555 --> 00:53:12,656
Watch it.

1168
00:53:13,424 --> 00:53:15,592
Your father is ten years
older than I am.

1169
00:53:15,626 --> 00:53:18,462
I'm ten years older than you.
How is that different?

1170
00:53:18,495 --> 00:53:19,897
Because...

1171
00:53:22,733 --> 00:53:24,468
Exactly.

1172
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:28,705
Believe me, when you get
to a certain age,

1173
00:53:28,739 --> 00:53:32,743
it really doesn't seem
to be such a big deal.

1174
00:53:33,744 --> 00:53:35,579
Really?

1175
00:53:35,612 --> 00:53:36,747
Really.

1176
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:41,318
I mean,
naturally there are differences

1177
00:53:41,351 --> 00:53:42,886
between the two of you.

1178
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:44,621
Like what?

1179
00:53:44,655 --> 00:53:46,457
Yes, like what?

in a good way.

You go with the flow.

1184

Like when someone
mistakes me for a stripper?

1185
00:54:03,874 --> 00:54:05,676
Like that.

1186
00:54:05,709 --> 00:54:07,611
And you care enough
about your father

1187
00:54:07,644 --> 00:54:10,814
to let him live with you
after his house sold so quickly.

1188
00:54:11,648 --> 00:54:13,750
Above asking price, I might add.

1189
00:54:13,784 --> 00:54:17,888
And he needed a place to live
until he could find a new house.

1190
00:54:20,858 --> 00:54:22,826
That was very nice of you.
Thank you.

1191
00:54:25,562 --> 00:54:26,830
You're welcome.

1192
00:54:28,832 --> 00:54:32,669
And you are comfortable
in your skin

1193
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:34,638
in the way that only people

And you're kind and generous.

1200
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:52,823
He has money?

1201
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:55,792
So not the point.

1202
00:54:55,826 --> 00:54:56,860
Sorry.

1203
00:54:57,895 --> 00:55:01,398
You're generous with
your time and your heart.

- Clueless.

1256
00:59:03,006 --> 00:59:08,311
and I know it doesn't conform
to society's norms, but...

1257
00:59:08,345 --> 00:59:13,049
yeah, I do...
I love you both.

1258
00:59:14,851 --> 00:59:17,187
If we weren't in this
fucked-up situation,

1259
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:19,856
we might give you
the time to figure it out.

1260
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:24,828
But we are in this
fucked-up situation,

1261
00:59:24,861 --> 00:59:26,730
as Colton so aptly put it.

1262
00:59:28,999 --> 00:59:31,201
And we just can't
do it any more.

1263
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:35,071
So that's it?

1264
00:59:36,807 --> 00:59:39,209
Both just gone from my life?

1265
00:59:40,377 --> 00:59:42,045
I guess so.

1266
00:59:42,712 --> 00:59:45,816
You couldn't make
a decision, Doug.

1267
00:59:46,983 --> 00:59:48,285
We had to.

1268
00:59:51,021 --> 00:59:52,355
Sorry.

1269
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:57,027
We're both sorry.

1270
01:00:03,066 --> 01:00:07,237
♪

1271
01:01:04,995 --> 01:01:06,830
There we go.

1272
01:01:06,863 --> 01:01:09,132
First hint of a smile
I've seen in three weeks.

1273
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,202
Sorry...
I've had a lot on my mind.

1274
01:01:12,235 --> 01:01:13,803
I know.

1275
01:01:13,837 --> 01:01:17,140
You've shared it with me,
over and over and over.

1276
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:19,142
Have I been that bad?

1277
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:21,745
Abso-fucking-lutely.

1278
01:01:21,778 --> 01:01:23,079
Careful...

1279
01:01:23,113 --> 01:01:25,382
That model child of yours
will hear you.

1280
01:01:27,117 --> 01:01:31,955
That kid learned the word bitch
on the playground last week,

1281
01:01:31,988 --> 01:01:35,959
and has proceeded
to call me a bitch ever since.

1282
01:01:35,992 --> 01:01:37,861
So he's perceptive, too?

1283
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:41,998
Yeah, I guess he is.

1284
01:01:42,966 --> 01:01:44,534
But enough about me.

1285
01:01:44,568 --> 01:01:46,136
How can I help you?

1286
01:01:47,103 --> 01:01:48,204
Get them back?

1287
01:01:50,006 --> 01:01:53,109
Oh, sweetie, If I thought
it would help, I would try.

1288
01:01:54,177 --> 01:01:55,478
But you don't?

1289
01:01:56,813 --> 01:01:58,281
Do you?

1290
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:02,085
I think so.

1291
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:05,355
I don't know anymore.

1292
01:02:06,523 --> 01:02:09,059
You know, if Jaden
turns out to be gay,

1293
01:02:09,092 --> 01:02:11,294
just make sure this
never happens to him.

1294
01:02:11,328 --> 01:02:13,563
Oh, my God,
I hope he turns out gay!

1295
01:02:13,597 --> 01:02:16,533
Then I would actually have
something in common with him.

1296
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:19,869
Unfortunately, that boy
is just like his father.

1297
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:22,038
Behaviors do run in the family.

1298
01:02:23,873 --> 01:02:25,575
You know what I think?

1299
01:02:25,609 --> 01:02:28,144
I think it's all genetic.

1300
01:02:28,178 --> 01:02:29,446
What?

1301
01:02:29,479 --> 01:02:31,114
Everything.

1302
01:02:31,147 --> 01:02:34,351
Yeah, I think it's all genetics,
like DNA.

1303
01:02:34,384 --> 01:02:39,155
But it's just so random that
there's no way to understand it.

1304
01:02:39,189 --> 01:02:41,591
Well, I think some scientists
might disagree with you.

1305
01:02:41,625 --> 01:02:43,526
No, no, take you
and your brother.

1306
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:44,961
Fraternal twins.

1307
01:02:44,995 --> 01:02:47,030
You don't look anything alike.

1308
01:02:47,063 --> 01:02:48,898
Which I find odd, by the way.

1309
01:02:48,932 --> 01:02:50,333
I think your mother's
hiding something.

1310
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:52,035
Maybe we were switched at birth.

1311
01:02:52,068 --> 01:02:54,204
Ooh, fun.

1312
01:02:54,237 --> 01:02:57,140
But let's assume no,
that did not happen.

1313
01:02:57,173 --> 01:03:00,910
You're twins, you're raised in
the same house, in the same way,

1314
01:03:00,944 --> 01:03:02,879
but you're gay
and he's straight.

1315
01:03:02,912 --> 01:03:04,047
What's up with that?

1316
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:05,849
Well, actually, studies show--

1317
01:03:05,882 --> 01:03:06,683
I'm not finished,

1318
01:03:06,716 --> 01:03:08,385
and I don't care
about your studies.

1319
01:03:08,418 --> 01:03:10,053
It's genetics, I tell you.

1320
01:03:10,086 --> 01:03:14,257
Take Jacob and Colton...
father and son, both gay.

1321
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:18,928
Both inexplicably
attracted to you.

1322
01:03:18,962 --> 01:03:20,063
Why?

1323
01:03:22,232 --> 01:03:25,602
Genetics....
Genetics, like DNA.

1324
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:28,371
Like, something deep down
in their DNA

1325
01:03:28,405 --> 01:03:31,608
is attracted to something
deep down in your DNA.

1326
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:36,146
And vice versa,
but because they're both gay,

1327
01:03:36,179 --> 01:03:37,580
you're not sure which one

1328
01:03:37,614 --> 01:03:39,549
you're supposed
to be attracted to.

1329
01:03:48,291 --> 01:03:50,193
That makes absolutely no sense.

1330
01:03:50,226 --> 01:03:51,327
No, it does, it does.

1331
01:03:51,361 --> 01:03:54,364
It's genetics, it's like
the pheromones wafting around.

1332
01:03:54,397 --> 01:03:55,465
Yes!

1333
01:03:55,498 --> 01:04:00,203
It's like you're sensing
something from one of them,

1334
01:04:00,236 --> 01:04:03,540
but the other one
is giving off a false scent.

1335
01:04:03,573 --> 01:04:05,475
And I'm supposed to figure out

1336
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:09,345
which one is real,
and which one is the placebo?

1337
01:04:09,379 --> 01:04:10,647
Yes!

1338
01:04:13,116 --> 01:04:14,451
Give me that wine.

1339
01:04:16,286 --> 01:04:18,254
That is the right answer,
my dear.

1340
01:04:24,961 --> 01:04:26,129
Doug.

1341
01:04:26,963 --> 01:04:28,031
Dougie.

1342
01:04:29,032 --> 01:04:30,166
Douglas.

1343
01:04:31,468 --> 01:04:33,002
Doogie!

1344
01:04:33,036 --> 01:04:34,671
Look on the bright side.

1345
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:36,406
There's a bright side?

1346
01:04:36,439 --> 01:04:37,407
Sure.

1347
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:39,642
You didn't want to have
to choose between them,

1348
01:04:39,676 --> 01:04:41,277
and now you don't have to.

1349
01:04:41,311 --> 01:04:43,446
My God, you should go
into motivational speaking.

1350
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:45,115
I know.

1351
01:04:45,148 --> 01:04:46,282
Is it working?

1352
01:04:46,316 --> 01:04:47,984
Not one little bit.

1353
01:04:50,086 --> 01:04:53,323
OK, what did Evelyn
say about it?

1354
01:04:53,356 --> 01:04:56,226
She gave me
a lecture about genetics.

1355
01:04:57,627 --> 01:04:58,695
Why?

1356
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:00,697
I have no idea.

1357
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:02,999
Wait, how'd you know
I talked to her?

1358
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:07,670
Because you always talk to her
about important stuff first.

1359
01:05:07,704 --> 01:05:08,805
And I don't mind.

1360
01:05:08,838 --> 01:05:13,276
I mean, after all, she has
made a relationship work.

1361
01:05:13,309 --> 01:05:15,678
And she even had a kid.

1362
01:05:17,347 --> 01:05:21,551
Well, you know
I value your advice, too.

1363
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:24,087
Please, like I have
anything to contribute

1364
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:26,356
to a conversation
about relationships...

1365
01:05:28,224 --> 01:05:29,592
Until now.

1366
01:05:35,398 --> 01:05:38,201
Wait... What?

1367
01:05:38,234 --> 01:05:39,636
I kinda met someone.

1368
01:05:40,603 --> 01:05:42,071
When?

1369
01:05:42,105 --> 01:05:43,706
Well, it was
right around that time

1370
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:47,644
of that mountain
cabin fiasco, so...

1371
01:05:47,677 --> 01:05:49,379
And you didn't tell me?

1372
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:52,448
I couldn't very well tell you
about something great

1373
01:05:52,482 --> 01:05:55,084
happening to me when
you're going through...this.

1374
01:05:55,118 --> 01:05:57,353
Yes, you can,
I want to know these things.

1375
01:05:57,387 --> 01:05:59,289
Lord knows you've
heard my share of drama.

1376
01:05:59,322 --> 01:06:01,224
Can I hear an AMEN?

1377
01:06:01,257 --> 01:06:05,094
And despite that remark,
I'm always here for you.

1378
01:06:05,128 --> 01:06:07,664
Good times, bad times.

1379
01:06:07,697 --> 01:06:10,366
Are you about
to burst into song?

1380
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,101
Maybe!

1381
01:06:12,135 --> 01:06:16,072
But first...
Spill your guts.

1382
01:06:16,105 --> 01:06:17,774
I want the dish.

1383
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:20,643
Oh, OK.

1384
01:06:20,677 --> 01:06:29,419
Well, he's just a little, teensy
weeny, itsy bitsy, tiny bit...

1385
01:06:29,452 --> 01:06:31,354
older than me.

1386
01:06:31,387 --> 01:06:34,524
Older than your real age,
or older than the age

1387
01:06:34,557 --> 01:06:36,392
you tell everybody you are?

1388
01:06:36,426 --> 01:06:37,460
Both.

1389
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:43,533
And he wears the worst
sweaters you've ever seen.

1390
01:06:43,566 --> 01:06:47,403
I mean, really, really bad.

1391
01:06:47,437 --> 01:06:52,809
And yet...
he's really sweet.

1392
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:55,311
Oh, my God...

1393
01:06:55,345 --> 01:06:56,579
You like sweet?

1394
01:06:56,613 --> 01:06:58,548
I do now.

1395
01:06:58,581 --> 01:07:00,583
Plus, he's hung
like an elephant.

1396
01:07:01,551 --> 01:07:03,519
That's the Woody I know.

1397
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:05,588
Oh, my gosh.

1398
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:07,390
Congratulations.

1399
01:07:07,423 --> 01:07:09,559
Wait, how...
where did you meet?

1400
01:07:09,592 --> 01:07:11,194
Get this...

1401
01:07:11,227 --> 01:07:13,162
My mom set us up.

1402
01:07:13,196 --> 01:07:15,131
How random is that?

1403
01:07:15,164 --> 01:07:16,266
Wow.

1404
01:07:16,299 --> 01:07:18,401
Life is random,
trust me on that.

1405
01:07:18,434 --> 01:07:20,436
I'm so excited for you!

1406
01:07:20,470 --> 01:07:22,105
Look at you...

1407
01:07:22,138 --> 01:07:23,606
You're all glowing.

1408
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:25,842
And I will be happy for you,

1409
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:28,778
no matter what happens
with Jacob and Colton.

1410
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,849
So...

1411
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:35,318
What do you
think's gonna happen?

1412
01:07:35,351 --> 01:07:36,619
[sighs]

1413
01:07:38,288 --> 01:07:40,223
Honestly?

1414
01:07:40,256 --> 01:07:42,692
I don't think I'll ever see
either one of them again.

1415
01:07:48,264 --> 01:07:49,766
Doug, you OK?

1416
01:07:51,234 --> 01:07:52,302
Fine.

1417
01:07:53,636 --> 01:07:55,338
Is my next client here?

1418
01:07:55,371 --> 01:07:58,107
No, but you do have a visitor.

1419
01:08:10,954 --> 01:08:13,122
- Hey.
- Hi.

1420
01:08:14,791 --> 01:08:16,492
He was asking about you,

1421
01:08:16,526 --> 01:08:18,561
so I just wanted
to make sure he found you.

1422
01:08:19,595 --> 01:08:21,164
There he is.

1423
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:26,469
And thanks for the introduction.
I'm Philip.

1424
01:08:26,502 --> 01:08:29,772
I'm Doug's number-one employee,
and I'm in an open relationship.

1425
01:08:29,806 --> 01:08:30,807
Philip.

1426
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:32,508
Just putting it out there.

1427
01:08:32,542 --> 01:08:33,910
Nice to meet you.

1428
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:36,279
You must be Jacob, right?

1429
01:08:36,312 --> 01:08:38,448
No, I'm Colton.

1430
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:41,484
Right, and I'm leaving.

1431
01:08:46,289 --> 01:08:47,690
