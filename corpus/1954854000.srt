1
00:00:09,708 --> 00:00:12,875
I'm worried the restaurant,
it lacks something.

2
00:00:13,083 --> 00:00:14,791
Customers?

3
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:18,333
No one will be surprised
when they come in anymore.

4
00:00:18,542 --> 00:00:23,000
- Have you seen their faces?
- Yes. "Is the place still here?"

5
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:27,000
Okay, so the restaurant is trustworthy,
but not surprising.

6
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:31,082
- What would surprise you?
- Customers.

7
00:00:31,292 --> 00:00:32,417
I never liked you.

8
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:35,125
I tolerate you,
but I've never liked you.

9
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:36,958
Here you are.

10
00:00:38,959 --> 00:00:41,209
I can show you what I have today.

11
00:00:44,792 --> 00:00:49,167
This fountain was built in 1903
Mortimer Hayward.

12
00:00:49,334 --> 00:00:52,667
- Have Beekman changed the design again?
- For God's sake.

13
00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:55,791
- It is Saturday.
- When does he expect it?

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,209
I wish you spent as
much time on your privacy.

15
00:00:59,417 --> 00:01:01,917
- Mom, I have lots of starlets.
- First Dates.

16
00:01:02,834 --> 00:01:04,501
- Hey!
- Your father and I ...

17
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:08,459
... Soon celebrate 40-year anniversary.
Do you know why?

18
00:01:08,667 --> 00:01:12,209
Because he asked me out
on a second date.

19
00:01:13,667 --> 00:01:16,042
- Sorry, Joe.
- You have not much time.

20
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,834
- Your father was bald at an early age.
- Wait.

21
00:01:19,542 --> 00:01:20,626
Dad has hair.

22
00:01:20,834 --> 00:01:22,751
Well, it can be discussed.

23
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:27,584
No, it's my mother who harasses
me about my love life again.

24
00:01:27,792 --> 00:01:31,584
Yes, if there was ever reason,
to come in to the office one weekend ...

25
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:34,709
I have distributed leaflets
local kontorsbyggnader-

26
00:01:34,918 --> 00:01:37,209
-Short campaigns on social medier-

27
00:01:38,042 --> 00:01:40,667
- Donated to local events
to raise the profile.

28
00:01:40,876 --> 00:01:43,459
Nat, we've been friends a long time now-

29
00:01:43,667 --> 00:01:48,082
- So I think I can say this,
without hurting your feelings.

30
00:01:48,292 --> 00:01:50,292
Stop with the opera.

31
00:01:50,501 --> 00:01:53,834
There is a wall of opera,
as soon as you come through the door.

32
00:01:54,042 --> 00:01:55,459
Mom loved the opera.

33
00:01:55,667 --> 00:01:58,375
She loved the customers too.

34
00:01:58,584 --> 00:02:02,751
I know the restaurant
is your familjearv. I understand that.

35
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:05,542
But it has not been the same.

36
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:07,792
I know. Do not you think I know that?

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,876
That's why I have a new chef on the road.

38
00:02:10,082 --> 00:02:14,167
I was hoping that after six
months would have found that ...

39
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:16,834
- I do not know.
- Magic?

40
00:02:17,042 --> 00:02:20,417
Yes, I figured I
perhaps could find it.

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,042
- Oh my God, it's Lori Beth?
- Who?

42
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,709
Lori Beth Wacker.
From the seventh grade, remember?

43
00:02:26,918 --> 00:02:28,000
Lori Beth.

44
00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:29,918
- Hello.
- Hello.

45
00:02:31,334 --> 00:02:33,501
- Lovely to meet you.
- Yes.

46
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:35,876
Your mother told me
that you were at home again.

47
00:02:36,082 --> 00:02:38,167
- Lori Beth. How are you?
- Nick. Hello.

48
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,042
I moved home for a couple of months ago.
How wonderful to meet you.

49
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:47,082
- How long ago was it?
- 15 years.

50
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,626
My one true love.

51
00:02:48,834 --> 00:02:50,584
And my biggest regret.

52
00:02:50,792 --> 00:02:52,667
To lose touch when we moved.

53
00:02:52,876 --> 00:02:54,751
But what a coincidence.

54
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,209
You know, Nick is a talented architect now.

55
00:02:57,417 --> 00:02:59,584
He constructs bridges.

56
00:02:59,792 --> 00:03:01,375
Nick, give her your card.

57
00:03:01,584 --> 00:03:03,876
You always wanted to build things.

58
00:03:04,082 --> 00:03:07,959
- Change the world.
- I do not exactly, but ...

59
00:03:08,167 --> 00:03:10,292
Lori Beth works with
landscape planning.

60
00:03:11,626 --> 00:03:14,042
Architect. Landscape.

61
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,459
It must be fate.

62
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:20,375
Speaking of work,
I like to work.

63
00:03:20,584 --> 00:03:23,584
- Really nice to meet you, Lori Beth.
- You too, Nick.

64
00:03:23,792 --> 00:03:25,751
- I'll call you.
- Awesome.

65
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:28,542
We have lots to catch up after so long.

66
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:29,876
There you have indeed.

67
00:03:30,082 --> 00:03:32,959
- So call him.
- Okay, I will.

68
00:03:33,167 --> 00:03:35,459
- Bye.
- Bye.

69
00:03:35,667 --> 00:03:38,250
We just happened to run into each other?

70
00:03:39,082 --> 00:03:40,334
What a coincidence.

71
00:03:40,542 --> 00:03:43,042
Life is full of coincidences.

72
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:47,000
Although sometimes
need to give them a little push.

73
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:52,959
I feel so bad about
you do not earn any tip.

74
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:54,501
Want to quit?

75
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:55,959
I want you to stop.

76
00:03:56,167 --> 00:04:00,834
Stop believing that you have to drive instead
exactly as it was when your mother was alive.

77
00:04:02,417 --> 00:04:04,125
Sorry, Nat.

78
00:04:04,334 --> 00:04:06,834
- I did not mean ...
- It's okay. It's just that ...

79
00:04:07,334 --> 00:04:10,167
If it does not start to go well
I will lose the restaurant.

80
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:14,000
Both I and the restaurant
is stuck in the past.

81
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:17,167
Come on.

82
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,000
- Grandma!
- Uncle Nick!

83
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:21,834
Ungar. Hello.

84
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:23,666
- Look.
- I like these.

85
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:27,500
Are we late? We took a detour
past the girls' favorite store.

86
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:30,709
- Neon and glitter house.
- So it is said not at all.

87
00:04:30,918 --> 00:04:35,167
Mom found yet another way to
introduce me to a future daughter in law.

88
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:38,083
Lori Beth Wacker.
He used to be crazy about her.

89
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:39,917
- I was 12th
- Grandma.

90
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:43,250
- Can we get 25-centare to the wishing well?
- 25 cents?

91
00:04:43,459 --> 00:04:45,167
In my time it was a penny.

92
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:49,581
Do not look at me, I spent all
my money on neon and glitter house.

93
00:04:49,605 --> 00:04:51,500
- It's not that.
- No?

94
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:54,042
25-centare.
Uncle Nick has 25-centare.

95
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:57,834
- Now we go and wish us something.
- You will be glad you did.

96
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:02,750
They are beautiful. Maybe I should
buy some at the restaurant.

97
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:06,541
Good morning, ladies.
A bouquet to brighten up the day?

98
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,666
- Yes. They are wonderful.
- 5.99 per bouquet.

99
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:13,041
All right. I'll take these.

100
00:05:15,584 --> 00:05:17,667
- Please.
- Keep it.

101
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,166
No, she takes it.

102
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:23,083
- No, it's okay.
- Take it, just.

103
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:26,708
Thank you.

104
00:05:26,918 --> 00:05:29,709
Sorry. What do you do?

105
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:31,584
All right.

106
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,584
You need this.

107
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:38,458
Wishing you a surprise.

108
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:43,416
To bring order in a restaurant
does not happen by magic.

109
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:46,291
If you knew surprise
would go 'compliance

110
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,000
What would you wish for?

111
00:05:48,209 --> 00:05:51,625
You should always hold on
with my love life ...

112
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:56,875
Looking for a penny?

113
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,834
I have everything I could dream of.

114
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,917
But if I had one wish for you ...

115
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:04,541
Then you would wish
I did not have to become bald.

116
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:08,083
I wish
that you would forget her.

117
00:06:08,834 --> 00:06:15,584
I know how you felt about Jessa,
but you must go on, darling.

118
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:18,333
You have to find the right one.

119
00:07:05,834 --> 00:07:08,375
I bet that my desire
wrapping before yours.

120
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:14,833
The time is almost 11:00. We must draw.

121
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:16,834
Goodbye old man.

122
00:07:27,709 --> 00:07:31,125
- Did he give you truly bill?
- The waitress came to us ...

123
00:07:31,334 --> 00:07:34,292
... And then he put the bill
in front of me, as if I'd ...

124
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,917
No, I do not believe you.

125
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:39,875
- Hold on.
- How long were we together? Two weeks?

126
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:41,834
I have trouble believing it.

127
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:44,791
- What kind of guy does that?
- A 44-year old man.

128
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,375
I guess it is.

129
00:07:46,584 --> 00:07:49,417
OPEN

130
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:58,583
I saw it.

131
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,959
I saw it.

132
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:17,000
If the city chooses solar,
we can connect the bridge to nätet-

133
00:08:17,209 --> 00:08:21,292
- Then you get the power when it needs to,
and gives back what is left over.

134
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:23,834
Would you tell him?

135
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:27,416
Mr. Beekman, sir. Good morning.

136
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:31,209
- Thanks for coming in over the weekend.
- A deadline is a deadline.

137
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:33,208
We understand. And do not worry.

138
00:08:33,417 --> 00:08:36,334
I'll give it a Beekman-touch.

139
00:08:36,542 --> 00:08:39,125
It is therefore planning committee
will come to you.

140
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,125
- Have you been presented to any customer?
- Not a chance.

141
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:48,750
Where is he?

142
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:51,500
I'm not sure.
He would fly into yesterday.

143
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,750
I can cook, if he will not.

144
00:08:54,417 --> 00:08:58,834
Thanks, Damien, but you may
can replenish the salt and pepper pots.

145
00:08:59,042 --> 00:09:00,500
Sure.

146
00:09:05,167 --> 00:09:07,292
There he is. Our new chef.

147
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,583
Natalia.

148
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:16,833
What's he saying?

149
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:20,250
He thinks I'm
a radiant beauty. Sweet.

150
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:22,583
You are not bad yourself.
My name Sharla.

151
00:09:22,792 --> 00:09:25,292
With "A", which kind is Italian.

152
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,625
Yes, keep staring at me,
with the dark brown eyes.

153
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,875
His name is Mario. Mario.

154
00:09:32,082 --> 00:09:35,500
You said he was an old man
from Italy. He is not old age.

155
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:40,000
I hope he can cook,
for it promised my relatives.

156
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:48,375
I'm sorry that I could not
welcome you at the airport yesterday.

157
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:51,792
I do not know how to
say it in Italian.

158
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:56,000
No problem. I feel
your warm welcome.

159
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:59,791
- Okay, Natalia.
- And he speaks English.

160
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:04,166
- Should I cook tonight?
- Yes, let me show you the kitchen.

161
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:06,750
It is a rather simple kitchen.

162
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:09,917
- Everything ...
- Idiot.

163
00:10:11,542 --> 00:10:13,500
Anyone here?

164
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:17,000
Hello? Hello.

165
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:19,958
No, mom. I told you
did not have to bring your lunch.

166
00:10:20,167 --> 00:10:22,625
I just want to be sure
you get a decent meal.

167
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,250
- Hey, Joe.
- Hello.

168
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:27,208
- I have something for you too.
- I love your mom.

169
00:10:27,417 --> 00:10:30,334
Told Nick that we ran into his ex?

170
00:10:30,542 --> 00:10:33,209
- Love of his life.
- Yes, when I was 12th

171
00:10:33,417 --> 00:10:35,500
Then she moved
and broke his heart.

172
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:38,000
I was 12th

173
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:39,458
His first kiss.

174
00:10:39,667 --> 00:10:42,417
- When you were 12th
- So it got stuck.

175
00:10:42,918 --> 00:10:45,500
- I want you to take her out.
- No, Mom.

176
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:47,791
You're a super-mom.
I love you.

177
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
How many times have I told you
not to fix me up with ...

178
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:54,291
Stand-up evening at the Comedy Cellar.

179
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,625
Tomorrow, noon. 20:00.

180
00:10:56,833 --> 00:11:00,333
Lori Beth loves to laugh.
It's a date.

181
00:11:00,542 --> 00:11:03,542
- I fixed it for you.
- Yes.

182
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,042
There are only two here.

183
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,583
Did not you buy three?

184
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,083
- So you can put yourself in a little more.
- May I?

185
00:11:10,292 --> 00:11:13,209
There are extra mustard in the bag, Joe.

186
00:11:13,417 --> 00:11:15,167
Your mom is the best.

187
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,458
Do you think Lori Beth has a friend?

188
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:19,917
Do not let me down.

189
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:23,125
She might become your come true
fountain desire.

190
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:26,750
No, my desire was to win
environmentally friendly bridge contest.

191
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:29,791
Come on, not so loud.

192
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,833
Beekman will find ...

193
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,833
How is it?

194
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:04,082
It's not the same.

195
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,082
It is better.

196
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:10,667
Awesome. I'll tell the chef.

197
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:15,125
- Wonderful.
- I think it's great.

198
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,750
- Is it a new dish?
- Where's the garlic?

199
00:12:18,792 --> 00:12:20,250
Right.

200
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,875
They love the food.

201
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:31,875
- What are you looking for?
- One of the regulars like extra garlic.

202
00:12:33,042 --> 00:12:35,667
Alfredo sauce.
I know it's weird, but ...

203
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:38,041
- Wait, wait.
- No, do not worry.

204
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,750
- It's just his thing.
- His thing is not my thing.

205
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,833
- What? Wait. Mario.
- Alfredo sauce.

206
00:12:43,042 --> 00:12:44,375
Mario.

207
00:12:48,042 --> 00:12:49,334
- Hello.
- Extra garlic?

208
00:12:49,542 --> 00:12:52,125
- Please.
- Additional more?

209
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:01,917
What he means is that he appreciates
Your suggestions for extra garlic.

210
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:05,167
I told you to eat like a pig.

211
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:07,667
All right.

212
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:10,875
No no no. The house offers ...

213
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:16,833
Natalia, you need more clienti.

214
00:13:17,042 --> 00:13:19,292
I can not cook without customers.

215
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,167
I can cook.

216
00:13:45,082 --> 00:13:47,416
You have two new voice messages.

217
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:48,833
New message.

218
00:13:49,042 --> 00:13:52,459
Hey, it's Amanda.
Thank you for dinner the other night.

219
00:13:52,667 --> 00:13:56,875
Hey, I heard about the art show
and I wondered ...

220
00:13:57,082 --> 00:13:59,583
Hello, this is Kelly from the coffee mill.

221
00:13:59,792 --> 00:14:04,125
I do not usually do like this,
but I thought of you ...

222
00:14:12,417 --> 00:14:16,500
PRICE FOR ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY BRIDGE
ARCHITECTURAL INSTITUTE

223
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:17,958
Together we build

224
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:37,875
When the cycle repeats itself,
along Aruba's coastal

225
00:15:38,082 --> 00:15:40,750
- Seeking the male flamingo
for a partner.

226
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:43,458
You have a new voice message.

227
00:15:43,667 --> 00:15:47,500
Hello, Natalie. It's Ellis, Sharlas cousin.
We met at her party.

228
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:49,666
Sharla said you need to get out.

229
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:52,125
No, wait, that did not sound good.

230
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,583
Anyway, I like to eat food.

231
00:15:54,792 --> 00:15:56,792
Wait, wait, it rings.

232
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:17,042
But it is not good on the island,
and our flamingo family kämpar-

233
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:20,875
- To survive the harsh,
windy autumn.

234
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,792
Want a table?

235
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:06,000
A table?

236
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:09,000
Wait.

237
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:12,416
How did I get here?

238
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:18,416
I recognize this place.

239
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:21,082
Where is everyone?

240
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,541
It's just us.

241
00:17:24,834 --> 00:17:26,709
My name is Natalie.

242
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:30,959
Hello, Natalie. I called Nick.

243
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:37,000
- It feels like I've seen you before.
- I know. It feels ...

244
00:17:37,334 --> 00:17:38,614
I feel like I know you.

245
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:47,583
Excuse me.

246
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:00,334
I think it's for you.

247
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:02,292
To me?

248
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,541
It is you.

249
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:17,375
No, it's my mother.

250
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:23,250
You've obviously inherited her spirit.

251
00:18:23,459 --> 00:18:24,875
Thank you.

252
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,791
Who are you?

253
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:35,791
You are so beautiful.

254
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:42,708
Did I like it?

255
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:44,958
It's nothing.

256
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,959
During the summer months,
the snow penguins water source.

257
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:07,500
When he received nourishment, he
viability to proceed.

258
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,291
It was a dream, but it was so real.

259
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,625
Especially the part where you woke up
alone in your pajamas.

260
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:29,334
- On my sofa.
- Did he look like Justin Timberlake?

261
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:31,125
- Better looking.
- No one is prettier ...

262
00:19:31,334 --> 00:19:34,334
... Than Justin Timberlake.
It was definitely a dream.

263
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,583
- Called my cousin Ellis you?
- Yes.

264
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:38,708
Why did you say to him to do it?

265
00:19:38,917 --> 00:19:43,041
Heart, I say this with love,
you have to call him up.

266
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:52,875
If you do not like to work on Saturday,
did not come in on Sunday.

267
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:55,584
- I know, buddy.
- Is that brotävlingen?

268
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:57,458
We have drawings to finish.

269
00:20:01,209 --> 00:20:04,292
Lori Beth has set a countdown clock
for our date tonight.

270
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:07,917
I get alerts every hour.

271
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:11,125
- Has she always been so?
- I do not know. I was 12th

272
00:20:11,334 --> 00:20:14,334
- She was sweet. Who remembers?
- Hon.

273
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,209
Doomsday Clock back?

274
00:20:17,834 --> 00:20:21,459
Now texting me she outfits to
see what she'll wear tonight.

275
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:24,291
She sends copies to the mother also.
It's amazing.

276
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,500
Dates are canceled.

277
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:29,125
I can not. My mother would kill me.

278
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:30,291
Mother Pig?

279
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:34,791
Kiddos. How is it going in the sandbox?
Are you finished with the drawings?

280
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,250
Almost.

281
00:20:36,459 --> 00:20:38,000
Very, very soon.

282
00:20:38,209 --> 00:20:40,667
We're doing it. No problem.

283
00:20:47,334 --> 00:20:50,459
- Set aside brotävlingen.
- I will.

284
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,791
Hold on.

285
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:55,333
- What is it white?
- Do you like it?

286
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:59,291
I added this solar array,
to help the bridge to generate power.

287
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:00,958
- It's brilliant.
- I know right?

288
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:05,833
I mean it. But you heard him.
We must focus on the drawings.

289
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:07,917
If he finds out the competition, you are screwed.

290
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:11,166
You can not only participate in various
races when you're working for him.

291
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,959
I know. I just ...

292
00:21:14,834 --> 00:21:18,083
I have to keep the brain in shape.

293
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:25,625
Hey, Mario.

294
00:21:29,209 --> 00:21:30,250
Limoncello?

295
00:21:30,459 --> 00:21:32,500
Yes. For tiramisun.

296
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:34,584
It is not possible.

297
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:36,083
Yes, it is possible.

298
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:39,416
No. This is my kitchen, okay?

299
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:41,417
This is my kitchen.

300
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:46,000
Our kitchen, no problem,
però no limoncello in tiramisun.

301
00:21:46,209 --> 00:21:48,709
It is a recipe from my grandmother
with a twist.

302
00:21:48,917 --> 00:21:50,375
But she was well Greeks?

303
00:21:50,584 --> 00:21:52,875
- What's the difference?
- Another recipe.

304
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:56,083
Not only does this recipe, all recipe.
It is time, Mario.

305
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:59,042
Come and taste with me.

306
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:02,083
Together we create magic.

307
00:22:02,584 --> 00:22:04,959
All right. About five minutes.

308
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:06,833
Five minutes.

309
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:12,333
What? He is Italian.
He is so with all women.

310
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:14,791
Well, he does not want to
cook with me,

311
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,625
- Which is a shame,
for it would be tough.

312
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:24,250
Okay, I'll see about it
are any clienti. I'm okay.

313
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:27,250
- Madame.
- Will.

314
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:29,041
Excuse me.

315
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:32,291
- It will be good.
- Excuse me.

316
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:40,166
What do you think?

317
00:22:40,584 --> 00:22:43,542
Outfit. Yes.
I think it is the best.

318
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,250
- Do you think?
- Yes, absolutely.

319
00:22:45,459 --> 00:22:47,625
I do not look like 12 anymore?

320
00:22:47,834 --> 00:22:49,584
Do I?

321
00:22:49,917 --> 00:22:52,041
- Nice to see you again.
- The same.

322
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:53,875
We're going to hit.

323
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:15,083
FREE TIRAMISU

324
00:23:18,416 --> 00:23:21,666
- What's this?
- "Storage b ..." What?

325
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:25,291
- Some kind of pasta?
- 'L'Agrifoglio. "

326
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,459
Something sort of wine.

327
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:29,292
L'Agrifoglio.

328
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,791
It means "holly" in Italian.

329
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,959
It was the name of my grandmother
restaurant in Italy.

330
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:37,541
The place was covered with holly.

331
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:41,625
- It was exactly like this.
- So it is authentic Italian?

332
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:45,416
With a twist.
And tonight we tiramisu.

333
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:47,834
- On the house.
- I am in.

334
00:23:48,041 --> 00:23:50,250
- Come on, Gloria.
- Okay.

335
00:23:50,459 --> 00:23:53,125
- Awesome.
- What's the twist?

336
00:23:53,334 --> 00:23:55,375
Tonight? Two new customers.

337
00:23:56,459 --> 00:23:58,542
Then it is best that I go.

338
00:24:04,416 --> 00:24:07,583
It was hilarious.
Sure, he was funny?

339
00:24:07,791 --> 00:24:11,166
Yes, he was ...
He was pretty funny.

340
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:16,125
What do we do now?
Should we relive time-

341
00:24:16,334 --> 00:24:19,709
- When we skipped homework
and hid in the library?

342
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:22,875
- In this case, it would be adorable.
- Then we'll go.

343
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:25,542
Your mother thought it was super fun.

344
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,750
- Really?
- Or when my brother Luke ...

345
00:24:27,959 --> 00:24:30,792
... Got his driver's license and
took us to the drive-in?

346
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,416
- Do you remember the children's banned the film?
- Yes, so you ...

347
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:36,917
So you told everything to my mom?

348
00:24:37,125 --> 00:24:40,334
Yes, today, when she helped me
to choose the outfit.

349
00:24:42,584 --> 00:24:46,667
You, I think I
is a bit overworked at jobbet-

350
00:24:46,875 --> 00:24:50,791
-so I should probably go home and sleep.

351
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:10,625
Tip. Accurate tip.

352
00:25:11,334 --> 00:25:12,417
- Tiramisu.
- Thanks.

353
00:25:12,625 --> 00:25:14,209
- On the house.
- Awesome.

354
00:25:14,416 --> 00:25:15,875
Thank you.

355
00:25:24,791 --> 00:25:26,333
Are you okay?

356
00:25:26,917 --> 00:25:27,958
Yes.

357
00:25:28,166 --> 00:25:31,000
Damiano, the floor is wet.
It must be dry.

358
00:25:32,666 --> 00:25:34,375
My ... My hero.

359
00:25:35,416 --> 00:25:37,000
I am a hero, huh?

360
00:25:37,209 --> 00:25:39,000
- Yes. Can ...? Can you help me?
- Yes.

361
00:25:39,209 --> 00:25:41,250
- Yes, we have to work.
- Okay.

362
00:25:41,709 --> 00:25:45,000
Remember when you found out
I wrote "Mrs. Lori Beth Smith" -

363
00:25:45,209 --> 00:25:46,875
-over my notebook?

364
00:25:47,083 --> 00:25:49,500
I was ashamed as an animal.

365
00:25:50,709 --> 00:25:54,167
- Here is my car.
- Okay.

366
00:25:55,834 --> 00:26:00,750
Lori Beth, I really appreciate
you went out with me.

367
00:26:01,125 --> 00:26:02,666
I was really my mother.

368
00:26:04,125 --> 00:26:06,791
That's not why I'm here, Nick.

369
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,500
I thought maybe it would
was something between us.

370
00:26:10,291 --> 00:26:12,875
I've always wondered about you.

371
00:26:13,083 --> 00:26:14,918
But now we're together again.

372
00:26:15,125 --> 00:26:18,584
I updated my online status
to "In a relationship with Nick Smith".

373
00:26:19,541 --> 00:26:21,500
You might want to remove it.

374
00:26:23,125 --> 00:26:25,375
Are you breaking up with me?

375
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:29,334
It does not end
if not even been together.

376
00:26:29,541 --> 00:26:35,541
I've just taken me through something
quite intensively with someone and ...

377
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:43,458
- It was great, Nat.
- Thank you, Sharla. Good night.

378
00:26:47,584 --> 00:26:51,292
- Thanks. Have a good evening.
- Good night, Damien. You too.

379
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,125
Natalia.

380
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:02,125
Limoncello in tiramisu is not original
recipe, but perhaps not so bad.

381
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:07,834
- That's big of you to admit, Mario.
- I am great.

382
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:11,750
Big heart.

383
00:27:13,416 --> 00:27:16,666
Do you like me?

384
00:27:19,291 --> 00:27:21,375
- As a chef?
- Yes.

385
00:27:22,917 --> 00:27:25,708
Yes. The paste is incredible.

386
00:27:25,917 --> 00:27:29,583
And main dishes
we can work on, but ...

387
00:27:30,584 --> 00:27:32,750
Che "working on".

388
00:27:33,291 --> 00:27:36,166
Okay, Natalia.
You teach me how to cook?

389
00:27:36,375 --> 00:27:38,291
- No.
- Natalia teaches Mario. All right.

390
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,000
No, it was a ...
It was a good night, Mario.

391
00:27:41,209 --> 00:27:43,375
Now we will be sure to get some sleep.

392
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:51,541
Some sleep.
You get some sleep.

393
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:54,917
You go to your home, and I ...

394
00:27:55,125 --> 00:27:57,459
Now we sleep.

395
00:27:58,125 --> 00:27:59,500
Yes.

396
00:28:00,625 --> 00:28:02,041
All right.

397
00:28:04,166 --> 00:28:08,250
Natalia, your mother and my mother,
were friends in school.

398
00:28:08,959 --> 00:28:13,334
My mom wanted to tell
she is very sad.

399
00:28:14,041 --> 00:28:16,082
Your beautiful mother.

400
00:28:16,291 --> 00:28:18,708
Your beautiful mother.

401
00:28:52,917 --> 00:28:56,041
The trees were taken over by savannen-

402
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:59,625
- And giraffes fighting
a war against the woods

403
00:28:59,834 --> 00:29:03,417
- To claim the country
we now call Africa.

404
00:29:12,875 --> 00:29:15,709
The highest animals
devoured the highest grenarna-

405
00:29:15,917 --> 00:29:20,541
- While the elephants used their strength
to lift the trees for nourishment.

406
00:29:32,166 --> 00:29:34,291
- Careful!
- It's okay.

407
00:29:35,416 --> 00:29:36,666
I can fly.

408
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:40,459
Do not do that. Please.
I just got here.

409
00:29:41,625 --> 00:29:43,875
I want to feel alive.

410
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:46,542
Really live. Would not you?

411
00:29:47,541 --> 00:29:48,750
Only ...

412
00:29:48,959 --> 00:29:51,042
I want to take risks.

413
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,750
Is not it about time?

414
00:29:54,166 --> 00:29:56,082
Look, it's so beautiful out there.

415
00:30:05,584 --> 00:30:08,375
Look there. Do you see?

416
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:11,082
- I see nothing.
- Exactly.

417
00:30:11,291 --> 00:30:15,917
This is where I hope
my bridge will stand.

418
00:30:16,375 --> 00:30:17,625
What bridge?

419
00:30:17,834 --> 00:30:21,625
I submitted a design
to a city contest.

420
00:30:22,584 --> 00:30:24,167
You design bridges?

421
00:30:24,375 --> 00:30:29,625
I do most drafts, but yes,
this is mine.

422
00:30:29,834 --> 00:30:32,334
I think that is good.

423
00:30:33,209 --> 00:30:34,959
I see it.

424
00:30:35,209 --> 00:30:38,042
There it is. I see it.

425
00:30:39,709 --> 00:30:43,042
- Have they built it? How is that possible?
- It is fantastic.

426
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:45,584
You are talented.

427
00:30:45,791 --> 00:30:47,625
That's why.

428
00:30:48,917 --> 00:30:50,583
It must be amazing.

429
00:30:50,791 --> 00:30:56,041
To create something,
and make it a reality.

430
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,959
It's not as scary up here.

431
00:31:10,125 --> 00:31:11,625
No.

432
00:31:12,791 --> 00:31:15,166
My mother used to say:

433
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,416
"Spread your wings, Natalie."

434
00:31:29,834 --> 00:31:32,250
You smell good.

435
00:31:33,834 --> 00:31:37,792
Amaretti. I baked today.

436
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,334
- What is amaretti?
- Cakes.

437
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:43,041
To the restaurant.

438
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,834
Let me show you something.

439
00:31:55,291 --> 00:31:57,250
The floating ...

440
00:31:57,666 --> 00:32:02,000
Liberate themselves from their frames.

441
00:32:05,291 --> 00:32:07,625
You get a taste of the magic.

442
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:26,375
What? And you say
you do not create something?

443
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:30,959
I? Create? I just ... I cook.

444
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:39,041
For me ...

445
00:32:41,416 --> 00:32:43,166
... It tastes like a creation.

446
00:32:45,416 --> 00:32:47,666
You may be right.

447
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,416
DREAM ENCYCLOPEDIA

448
00:33:19,416 --> 00:33:23,250
You interpret dreams?
Do you dream of me?

449
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:25,417
Dreams revealing
our innermost secrets.

450
00:33:25,625 --> 00:33:27,834
And desires, bella.

451
00:33:28,459 --> 00:33:30,375
Yes. I have to work.

452
00:33:30,584 --> 00:33:34,417
Here, an old family recipe
from Umbria. With a twist.

453
00:33:35,959 --> 00:33:38,709
She called me in tears.

454
00:33:39,209 --> 00:33:40,542
Okay, I'm a pig.

455
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:43,083
You and several others.

456
00:33:43,291 --> 00:33:46,791
She has had three broken engagements
recent years.

457
00:33:47,166 --> 00:33:50,125
- Three?
- Two, three.

458
00:33:50,334 --> 00:33:55,167
It means that she is ready,
but have not found the right person.

459
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:00,416
Have you ever dreamed
if someone you've never met?

460
00:34:00,625 --> 00:34:03,083
As the dream of Jack Nicholson?

461
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,250
A young, virile, Jack Nicholson?

462
00:34:05,459 --> 00:34:08,333
No, mom.
Forget I mentioned it.

463
00:34:08,833 --> 00:34:12,082
Have you found a dream girl, darling?

464
00:34:14,291 --> 00:34:19,625
This is going to sound ridiculous,
but I dream about this nice girl.

465
00:34:19,833 --> 00:34:22,166
She is so real.

466
00:34:22,375 --> 00:34:25,416
More real than any
I ever met.

467
00:34:25,626 --> 00:34:27,626
That's wonderful.

468
00:34:27,833 --> 00:34:30,041
If you dream of a special GIRLS

469
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:33,833
- Prepares your brain you on
to fall in love for real.

470
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:36,750
This is very promising.

471
00:34:36,958 --> 00:34:39,708
My job as a mother is ready for today.

472
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:41,666
Good to know.

473
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:46,708
Mario, an excellent evening. Thank you.

474
00:34:52,375 --> 00:34:53,958
- Thanks, you guys. Good night.
- Bye.

475
00:34:54,166 --> 00:34:56,166
- We'll see.
- Bye.

476
00:34:57,583 --> 00:35:01,750
Neither a wink or kiss
for poor Mario?

477
00:35:01,958 --> 00:35:06,041
Do you dream about that guy who is
prettier than Justin Timberlake again?

478
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:08,416
Two nights in a row.

479
00:35:08,626 --> 00:35:10,667
- Wow.
- I know.

480
00:35:10,876 --> 00:35:13,876
He's just like anybody I
would be with the real thing.

481
00:35:14,083 --> 00:35:15,626
Why do not I have such dreams?

482
00:35:15,833 --> 00:35:21,458
When I'm with him, it feels like
we have always known each other.

483
00:35:21,666 --> 00:35:25,500
It's like a fantasy.

484
00:35:25,708 --> 00:35:28,500
I agree probably going mad.

485
00:35:28,708 --> 00:35:32,791
I can not wait until I go to sleep
so that I might get to meet him.

486
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,541
- Am I crazy?
- Yes. Maybe.

487
00:35:35,751 --> 00:35:42,083
What do you do if you met the love,
though he exists only in one's fantasy

488
00:35:42,291 --> 00:35:47,083
- And there is no chance of it
will meet, for he is pretending?

489
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:52,416
And what if the life-

490
00:35:53,583 --> 00:35:59,041
- Are so much better in dreams,
that it never felt more alive.

491
00:36:03,583 --> 00:36:08,250
I think you should get some sleep.

492
00:37:10,918 --> 00:37:12,751
This is crazy.

493
00:37:17,918 --> 00:37:19,501
All right.

494
00:38:53,416 --> 00:38:56,500
Will this continue
night after night?

495
00:38:58,666 --> 00:39:00,833
I was hoping to see you here.

496
00:39:02,083 --> 00:39:05,041
Plums. My favorite.

497
00:39:06,291 --> 00:39:07,458
Oh, this.

498
00:39:07,791 --> 00:39:09,750
It is unreal good.
You must taste.

499
00:39:09,958 --> 00:39:11,791
- Careful.
- I'll be careful.

500
00:39:17,666 --> 00:39:20,125
Wow, wonderful.

501
00:39:20,583 --> 00:39:23,208
- Like a snowball fight?
- You lose.

502
00:39:23,416 --> 00:39:25,958
I doubt it. Oh, no!

503
00:39:27,125 --> 00:39:28,876
Wait, you can not ... It's not fair.

504
00:39:29,083 --> 00:39:31,250
I beat you.

505
00:39:31,791 --> 00:39:33,875
You let me win, right?

506
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:40,000
I used to have a picnic on a
place like this when I was little.

507
00:39:41,666 --> 00:39:43,875
Had the mood lighting?

508
00:39:47,501 --> 00:39:51,125
Plums and plates with food.

509
00:39:54,166 --> 00:39:57,166
Everything is good, except the broccoli.

510
00:39:57,918 --> 00:39:59,876
You've never tasted my broccoli.

511
00:40:00,083 --> 00:40:02,041
I own an Italian restaurant, you know.

512
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:03,333
Is that so?

513
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,166
What are we doing here?

514
00:40:08,375 --> 00:40:15,208
I guess I can take you there,
and cook some special broccoli.

515
00:40:17,208 --> 00:40:18,833
If you want.

516
00:40:20,958 --> 00:40:22,875
I would love to.

517
00:40:24,208 --> 00:40:25,666
All right.

518
00:40:26,208 --> 00:40:27,875
Harat.

519
00:40:31,958 --> 00:40:35,041
When she fell ill, I cooked food
and took me to the hospital.

520
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:38,333
But she was so weak
that she could not eat.

521
00:40:38,541 --> 00:40:43,291
The food was something we shared all these years.

522
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:45,833
Since she died ...

523
00:40:46,041 --> 00:40:50,041
As soon as you think of her,
reminds the restaurant you about her.

524
00:40:51,208 --> 00:40:53,000
I ... It must be difficult.

525
00:40:53,208 --> 00:40:59,166
That every day reminded anyone
you love that can not be there.

526
00:40:59,375 --> 00:41:02,708
You have to put
your own stamp on the place.

527
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:05,666
Really make it your own.

528
00:41:08,541 --> 00:41:10,708
How long have we walked?

529
00:41:10,918 --> 00:41:13,626
I think we're close.

530
00:41:13,833 --> 00:41:15,500
All night?

531
00:41:16,041 --> 00:41:17,750
It's nothing.

532
00:41:19,876 --> 00:41:22,709
You will become a famous designer.
It shows.

533
00:41:22,918 --> 00:41:24,375
Do you think so?

534
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:26,166
I do not know.

535
00:41:26,375 --> 00:41:31,208
Do you believe, deep down, that it is
normal to doubt himself?

536
00:41:31,416 --> 00:41:33,918
I think it is abnormal
not to do it.

537
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:38,041
But you will win the prize.
You'll see.

538
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:39,918
Oh, I ...

539
00:41:40,458 --> 00:41:46,250
I think we went wrong.
I think we should be there.

540
00:41:48,125 --> 00:41:49,751
It's okay.

541
00:41:49,958 --> 00:41:52,625
- I've been nice.
- Me too.

542
00:41:53,918 --> 00:41:55,918
Tomorrow night perhaps?

543
00:41:56,291 --> 00:41:57,958
Definitely.

544
00:42:03,626 --> 00:42:06,667
- I think I'm starting ...
- I know.

545
00:42:07,708 --> 00:42:09,291
So do I.

546
00:42:15,125 --> 00:42:18,083
- Tomorrow.
- Yes.

547
00:43:04,501 --> 00:43:06,125
You must try. Squid pasta.

548
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:09,458
All right. With a twist.

549
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,626
This is definitely not the opera.

550
00:43:14,833 --> 00:43:18,875
- What do you think?
- It was about time. But this ...

551
00:43:25,333 --> 00:43:26,958
I can hardly believe.

552
00:43:28,125 --> 00:43:30,250
It is hard to say "L'Agrifoglio".

553
00:43:30,458 --> 00:43:32,416
"Russo's Italian."

554
00:43:32,626 --> 00:43:34,167
And you can say it.

555
00:43:34,375 --> 00:43:37,250
And customers too.
Only it's a coup.

556
00:43:37,458 --> 00:43:40,291
I had a dream
and woke up and tänkte-

557
00:43:40,501 --> 00:43:45,459
- I must make it my own
without forgetting its history.

558
00:43:45,876 --> 00:43:47,292
Suggested dream guy there?

559
00:43:47,501 --> 00:43:49,626
No.

560
00:43:49,833 --> 00:43:51,833
No, I just ... It was just me.

561
00:43:52,291 --> 00:43:55,208
Of course it was you.

562
00:43:55,416 --> 00:43:56,791
You can not trust men.

563
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,333
They are unreliable, even in fantasies.

564
00:44:17,041 --> 00:44:19,541
- What do you do?
- What? The desire to share with you?

565
00:44:19,751 --> 00:44:24,292
Come on, stargazer,
otherwise we will sit all night.

566
00:44:24,501 --> 00:44:26,626
No, not all night.

567
00:44:26,833 --> 00:44:28,917
- I have plans.
- Me too.

568
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:32,708
I know I do not have much of a life
outside this place, but ...

569
00:44:33,458 --> 00:44:34,958
Excuse me?

570
00:44:35,166 --> 00:44:37,083
- It is Jessa, heartthrob.
- No.

571
00:44:37,958 --> 00:44:39,750
Hello, Jessa. It's Joe.

572
00:44:39,958 --> 00:44:41,917
- Do not ...
- Yes. No, yeah, actually.

573
00:44:42,125 --> 00:44:44,751
- I watch all Nick calls.
- Hang up.

574
00:44:44,958 --> 00:44:47,583
Well, right now, Nick the manager.

575
00:44:47,791 --> 00:44:49,833
- It is good.
- Yes, he's on the rise.

576
00:44:50,041 --> 00:44:52,458
I'll tell you called? All right.

577
00:44:52,666 --> 00:44:54,208
Okay, bye-bye.

578
00:44:54,416 --> 00:44:55,875
- She's back.
- No.

579
00:44:56,083 --> 00:44:57,166
No no no.

580
00:44:57,375 --> 00:44:58,751
- Yes.
- No, listen.

581
00:44:58,958 --> 00:45:00,708
- Goddess Jessa.
- Gone.

582
00:45:00,918 --> 00:45:02,541
No.

583
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:04,833
- Do not do it.
- Gone.

584
00:45:05,041 --> 00:45:06,541
- No.
- Gone.

585
00:45:06,751 --> 00:45:08,250
Not that, please.

586
00:45:08,458 --> 00:45:10,958
- We might retain it.
- Yes.

587
00:46:24,041 --> 00:46:25,375
Nick? Come in.

588
00:46:27,708 --> 00:46:29,375
Jessa?

589
00:46:30,918 --> 00:46:33,041
- What is it?
- A mouse.

590
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:36,125
A what?

591
00:46:37,166 --> 00:46:40,126
Is that why you call in the middle of the night
and says it's an emergency?

592
00:46:40,208 --> 00:46:42,082
It's really great.

593
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:46,583
It's over there.
Under the sink.

594
00:46:48,791 --> 00:46:50,541
I did not know who I would call.

595
00:46:50,751 --> 00:46:54,083
Why not call Bob or steak,
whatever his name was.

596
00:46:55,751 --> 00:46:57,083
Steak.

597
00:47:06,833 --> 00:47:09,000
It's a really big mouse.

598
00:47:11,208 --> 00:47:14,250
That may be a rat.

599
00:47:19,166 --> 00:47:20,416
Do not leave me.

600
00:47:30,583 --> 00:47:31,625
Hello?

601
00:47:35,501 --> 00:47:37,334
Hello?

602
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:50,208
Hello?

603
00:47:51,626 --> 00:47:53,417
Hello?

604
00:47:54,375 --> 00:47:55,416
Where are you?

605
00:47:57,918 --> 00:47:59,000
Hello?

606
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,041
Hello?

607
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:07,125
Where are you?

608
00:48:18,791 --> 00:48:20,416
I made a mistake.

609
00:48:21,583 --> 00:48:24,125
I made a terrible mistake.

610
00:49:17,166 --> 00:49:20,041
You hit Jessa again.

611
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:24,041
Have you put a GPS in my neck
so you can track me around the clock?

612
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:27,501
I do not need a chip.
I have a mom radar.

613
00:49:27,708 --> 00:49:29,583
When I said you should dejta-

614
00:49:29,791 --> 00:49:32,958
- I did not mean with that
was unfaithful and broke your heart.

615
00:49:33,166 --> 00:49:36,875
I'm a big boy.
I have released it. You should too.

616
00:49:37,083 --> 00:49:38,375
- Please.
- Thanks.

617
00:49:38,583 --> 00:49:40,541
- Sure.
- How do you know that I met her?

618
00:49:40,751 --> 00:49:45,375
I saw it online. A photo of a rat
and her hero ex-boyfriend, Nick.

619
00:49:45,583 --> 00:49:48,708
So my mom's friend
with my ex-girlfriends.

620
00:49:48,918 --> 00:49:53,375
I accepted her friendship
when I thought she was human.

621
00:49:53,583 --> 00:49:56,583
They should keep your generation
away from the Internet.

622
00:49:56,791 --> 00:49:58,875
You do not look to have slept at all.

623
00:49:59,083 --> 00:50:03,125
Thanks, Sharla. I slept long enough to
realize that I do not want to live in a dream.

624
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:07,208
I want to feel alive again,
I used to do.

625
00:50:07,416 --> 00:50:11,083
The restaurant is my moment.
I have to put a spin on it.

626
00:50:11,291 --> 00:50:13,918
I can not keep it
Mom's sake, but for my own.

627
00:50:14,125 --> 00:50:15,541
There she is.

628
00:50:15,751 --> 00:50:18,459
We pulled in twice as much last night
we made all week.

629
00:50:18,666 --> 00:50:21,416
I will continue to work with the recipes,
put my stamp on it-

630
00:50:21,626 --> 00:50:25,292
- Inserting it in the 2000s
and then maybe I can dating.

631
00:50:25,501 --> 00:50:28,250
My cousin Ellis still waiting.

632
00:50:31,958 --> 00:50:33,708
Hello, Mr. Taylor.

633
00:50:33,918 --> 00:50:36,918
Nick Smith. I'm working
on your project, with Beekman.

634
00:50:37,125 --> 00:50:42,541
I just wanted to introduce myself
and tell me that my partner and me

635
00:50:42,751 --> 00:50:46,459
- Here at the company, has boiled
together some innovative idéer-

636
00:50:46,666 --> 00:50:50,791
- Who can save the city money,
raise the environmental profile of a component

637
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,375
And maybe get a tax credit.

638
00:50:53,583 --> 00:50:55,291
- Really?
- To be specific ...

639
00:50:55,501 --> 00:50:59,042
... I think we can incorporate
collecting rainwater

640
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:02,876
- Sewage, recycling,
without much additional cost.

641
00:51:03,333 --> 00:51:05,833
Interesting.
I look forward to hearing more.

642
00:51:06,041 --> 00:51:07,041
Nick. Nick Smith.

643
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:09,666
- George Taylor. Same to you.
- Nice to meet you.

644
00:51:20,583 --> 00:51:23,166
Jeez, it looks much better
without it, right?

645
00:51:24,958 --> 00:51:29,041
Oh, Mario. I thought we
should have the risotto as a special right tonight.

646
00:51:30,833 --> 00:51:34,791
Awesome. And after work,
I wondered if ...

647
00:51:35,501 --> 00:51:37,667
I'm not so good at this.

648
00:51:37,876 --> 00:51:40,667
Will you go out with me?

649
00:51:44,166 --> 00:51:45,541
All right.

650
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:53,708
- How long did you talk to him?
- 20 minutes.

651
00:51:53,918 --> 00:51:56,209
Light 20 minutes.

652
00:51:56,416 --> 00:52:01,000
You will experience Beekman-
touch, but not in a good way.

653
00:52:01,791 --> 00:52:04,791
What's the point,
if we do not show up your feet?

654
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,541
If you do not want to work here.

655
00:52:07,501 --> 00:52:09,542
Do not you think we should
few make ourselves heard?

656
00:52:09,751 --> 00:52:11,584
What happened to you?

657
00:52:16,791 --> 00:52:18,708
Hello, Jessa. It's Joe.

658
00:52:18,918 --> 00:52:21,541
How are you? What, do you want ...?

659
00:52:21,751 --> 00:52:23,709
- Hello.
- I just wanted to ...

660
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:28,334
Tonight?

661
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:32,958
If he wants to go back to Jessa,
it is his own affair.

662
00:52:33,166 --> 00:52:35,166
He needs to dating someone serious.

663
00:52:35,375 --> 00:52:37,166
Get married, have children, be happy.

664
00:52:37,375 --> 00:52:39,458
Mom says marriage
do not make you happy.

665
00:52:39,666 --> 00:52:43,583
Okay, it was a message
the authorization for my girls.

666
00:52:44,041 --> 00:52:46,500
Taken out of context,
let it probably ...

667
00:52:49,501 --> 00:52:53,834
Nick might avoid intimacy to ...
See on your perfect marriage.

668
00:52:54,041 --> 00:52:57,583
Can you blame him if he thinks
he can never get it.

669
00:52:58,958 --> 00:53:00,166
I hate broccoli.

670
00:53:00,375 --> 00:53:01,833
Sarah, no.

671
00:53:02,041 --> 00:53:04,750
Oops, prinsesstallriken
was not to you.

672
00:53:05,166 --> 00:53:09,250
It was the Princess
Tatiana of Morania.

673
00:53:09,626 --> 00:53:13,083
She is in town and always come here
our secret broccoli recipes.

674
00:53:13,291 --> 00:53:15,541
She says it makes
hair long and thick.

675
00:53:15,751 --> 00:53:17,417
- I'll take it.
- I'll keep it.

676
00:53:17,626 --> 00:53:19,125
All right.

677
00:53:21,291 --> 00:53:25,958
Excuse me. Are you in a relationship?
For I believe that you and my son ...

678
00:53:26,166 --> 00:53:27,625
Mom.

679
00:53:27,833 --> 00:53:29,750
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

680
00:53:29,958 --> 00:53:31,166
What?

681
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:33,833
- She is wonderful.
- Seriously.

682
00:53:35,291 --> 00:53:36,541
Hold on.

683
00:53:36,751 --> 00:53:39,667
Are you saying that you turned down her?

684
00:53:39,876 --> 00:53:43,292
Liberty Jessa invading
my dreams in a chaste manner.

685
00:53:43,501 --> 00:53:46,083
I said I needed to get to sleep tonight.

686
00:53:46,291 --> 00:53:48,583
I wish I had your problems.

687
00:53:48,791 --> 00:53:52,750
Smith. My office, now.

688
00:53:58,166 --> 00:54:02,541
I'm just really surprised that you
discussed my project with the customer.

689
00:54:02,708 --> 00:54:05,208
You are here to draw.
If you have a problem with it-

690
00:54:05,416 --> 00:54:08,791
- Maybe you should find another job
that suits you better.

691
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,166
Yes, sir, I hear you.

692
00:54:11,416 --> 00:54:18,458
And by the way, I really hope
your contribution to the competition is on your time.

693
00:54:18,708 --> 00:54:22,291
Yes. It is embarrassing to
a colleague in finalistjuryn-

694
00:54:22,501 --> 00:54:25,459
- Contact me
if your contribution to my firm.

695
00:54:27,666 --> 00:54:29,083
I am ...

696
00:54:29,291 --> 00:54:31,833
I'm sorry.
I should have told you ...

697
00:54:32,041 --> 00:54:34,208
- ... That I attend.
- Yes.

698
00:54:41,918 --> 00:54:43,584
I downloaded a drink.

699
00:54:44,208 --> 00:54:46,791
Is it ...? Is it limoncello?

700
00:54:47,708 --> 00:54:50,583
It tastes much better
in a efterrätt-

701
00:54:50,791 --> 00:54:52,541
-an in a drink.

702
00:54:54,751 --> 00:54:56,501
- Do you like to dance?
- Not directly ...

703
00:54:56,708 --> 00:54:59,583
- Come on.
- I like to dance alone.

704
00:55:12,918 --> 00:55:14,876
- Okay.
- Yes.

705
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:22,041
- I ... I'm horrible at dancing.
- You're a very good dancer.

706
00:55:23,626 --> 00:55:26,501
- Okay.
- This is great.

707
00:55:57,791 --> 00:55:59,708
Natalie?

708
00:56:16,375 --> 00:56:17,541
Natalie!

709
00:56:53,166 --> 00:56:57,458
- You like kicks and jazz hands.
- I can no movement.

710
00:56:57,666 --> 00:56:59,875
- You sing.
- I'm trying.

711
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:02,166
Yes, it makes you really.

712
00:57:02,375 --> 00:57:03,833
- You're a good dancer.
- No.

713
00:57:11,458 --> 00:57:12,875
All right.

714
00:57:15,041 --> 00:57:16,625
Natalia.

715
00:57:20,751 --> 00:57:24,709
- Not so bad, huh?
- No, not so bad.

716
00:57:26,708 --> 00:57:30,125
- Our mothers might was right.
- What do you mean?

717
00:57:30,541 --> 00:57:34,083
The last time your mother came to Italy
talked of our mothers.

718
00:57:34,291 --> 00:57:37,666
I heard them say:
"Mario and Natalia, is ..."

719
00:57:40,583 --> 00:57:44,208
- "They are made for each other."
- Did they say that?

720
00:57:54,958 --> 00:57:56,416
Good night.

721
00:58:04,918 --> 00:58:08,250
How long have you dreamed
this fictional person?

722
00:58:09,083 --> 00:58:10,626
Three nights.

723
00:58:10,833 --> 00:58:12,875
And then I missed one.

724
00:58:13,083 --> 00:58:17,291
And last night, she appeared not up ...

725
00:58:18,876 --> 00:58:21,209
I do not know.

726
00:58:21,416 --> 00:58:26,125
I found her
and made her disappear.

727
00:58:33,333 --> 00:58:38,250
I could hardly wait to go to sleep
to meet her.

728
00:58:38,458 --> 00:58:41,875
To be with her,
was fantastic.

729
00:58:42,291 --> 00:58:46,166
I was invulnerable.
I could do anything.

730
00:58:51,501 --> 00:58:53,584
You are really calm right now.

731
00:58:53,791 --> 00:58:56,208
That worries me.
I thought you would be angry.

732
00:58:56,416 --> 00:58:58,291
- I? No.
- Yes.

733
00:58:58,501 --> 00:59:02,250
Things you can not explain
happens every day.

734
00:59:02,458 --> 00:59:04,082
Yes.

735
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:08,416
Yes, but you do not want
live in dreamland.

736
00:59:08,626 --> 00:59:10,959
If it's worth anything,
maybe you sheepmeat

737
00:59:11,166 --> 00:59:13,833
- A price in the weekend,
in this real world.

738
00:59:14,833 --> 00:59:17,666
I'm not so sure that it will be so.

739
00:59:21,583 --> 00:59:23,082
60 percent in the evening.

740
00:59:23,291 --> 00:59:26,500
Any changes you have made
really worth.

741
00:59:26,708 --> 00:59:29,500
One feels almost back instead.

742
00:59:29,708 --> 00:59:33,625
You should call the TV restaurant critic.

743
00:59:33,833 --> 00:59:37,082
It is not a bad idea.
Maybe when the menu is in order.

744
00:59:37,291 --> 00:59:40,833
Are you okay?
Some good dreams lately?

745
00:59:41,041 --> 00:59:44,333
No, I hardly slept last night.
I was out with Mario yesterday.

746
00:59:44,541 --> 00:59:48,625
We danced, if you can imagine it.

747
00:59:49,708 --> 00:59:54,708
You know how it is said
Dissolving things in their dreams?

748
00:59:55,208 --> 00:59:59,082
Dream guy maybe your way of
show yourself that you could go on.

749
00:59:59,291 --> 01:00:00,875
And you did.

750
01:00:01,083 --> 01:00:02,791
Good for you.

751
01:00:04,291 --> 01:00:06,791
- Hello. Welcome to Russo's.
- Hello.

752
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,416
Just three? In this direction.

753
01:00:09,626 --> 01:00:10,667
- Hello.
- Hello.

754
01:00:14,791 --> 01:00:17,083
- Hello.
- Hello.

755
01:00:20,708 --> 01:00:25,041
I thought you said that we
would eat at home tonight?

756
01:00:26,375 --> 01:00:30,291
You know I'm not laws
food, so we're going out.

757
01:00:30,501 --> 01:00:34,626
I've had a really tough day.
I'm tired.

758
01:00:35,918 --> 01:00:39,166
The clock is 19:00, so ...

759
01:00:39,375 --> 01:00:42,166
It was bedtime long time ago for you.

760
01:00:46,666 --> 01:00:49,750
Okay, pick a place. We can go out.

761
01:00:49,958 --> 01:00:52,208
Thank you.

762
01:00:56,583 --> 01:00:58,333
Have you been here before?

763
01:00:58,541 --> 01:01:00,083
It is new.

764
01:01:05,458 --> 01:01:08,666
Six new just arrived. We are almost
crammed. What should I do?

765
01:01:08,876 --> 01:01:11,209
I'll help you.
Give me a couple of minutes only.

766
01:01:12,666 --> 01:01:13,918
- Download.
- Excuse me.

767
01:01:14,125 --> 01:01:16,208
I can cook. I can cook.

768
01:01:16,416 --> 01:01:19,041
All right. Thank you, Damien.

769
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:25,250
- Hello. Welcome to Russo's Italian.
- Thanks.

770
01:01:25,458 --> 01:01:27,000
For two. Do you have anything?

771
01:01:27,208 --> 01:01:29,583
The last table. This way.

772
01:01:38,791 --> 01:01:41,458
- Thanks.
- Please.

773
01:01:42,125 --> 01:01:45,751
- Do you want to start with something to drink?
- Yes.

774
01:01:46,501 --> 01:01:48,751
- Thanks.
- I take a pinot.

775
01:01:48,958 --> 01:01:51,416
Wonderful choice.

776
01:01:51,626 --> 01:01:53,042
Same for me. Thank you.

777
01:01:53,250 --> 01:01:54,791
All right.

778
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,458
Wait, we should ...?

779
01:01:56,666 --> 01:01:58,750
- Should we order?
- Yes.

780
01:01:58,958 --> 01:02:01,750
We should probably order.
You seem really busy.

781
01:02:03,416 --> 01:02:05,208
You can order well for me?

782
01:02:05,416 --> 01:02:07,208
Now I feel stressed.

783
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,041
She takes anatra ...

784
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:17,626
- Okay.
- ... And I will take the lamb.

785
01:02:18,208 --> 01:02:20,333
Perfect. Thank you.

786
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,375
If you add the broccoli, please.

787
01:02:24,583 --> 01:02:26,000
Yes.

788
01:02:26,416 --> 01:02:27,750
Thank you.

789
01:02:27,958 --> 01:02:29,250
You hate broccoli.

790
01:02:30,626 --> 01:02:33,000
Maybe I'm a changed man.

791
01:02:40,501 --> 01:02:41,918
Nick.

792
01:02:42,541 --> 01:02:44,666
Nick. Come on, please.

793
01:02:48,833 --> 01:02:50,125
For a fresh start?

794
01:02:51,833 --> 01:02:54,666
Yes. A fresh start.

795
01:02:55,918 --> 01:02:57,541
Cheers.

796
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,791
I'm thinking of leaving Beekman.

797
01:03:09,583 --> 01:03:12,666
- Are you going to leave Beekman?
- Yes.

798
01:03:12,876 --> 01:03:15,292
It would mean
to be out on their own.

799
01:03:15,918 --> 01:03:18,334
Or with Joe if he wants to.

800
01:03:19,501 --> 01:03:22,042
You mean really seriously.

801
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,833
It does not feel like the right time to take risks.

802
01:03:26,416 --> 01:03:28,083
Why not?

803
01:03:29,250 --> 01:03:31,708
Right, I have not even told.

804
01:03:31,918 --> 01:03:35,250
I am a finalist in the city brotävling.

805
01:03:36,250 --> 01:03:37,501
- Really?
- Yes.

806
01:03:37,708 --> 01:03:41,958
Oh my God. Congratulations.
Is it a large cash prize or ...?

807
01:03:42,166 --> 01:03:45,750
No, it is more about prestige.

808
01:03:47,250 --> 01:03:49,083
So there is no money?

809
01:03:51,166 --> 01:03:57,416
No, but, I mean, if I win
people will take notice of me.

810
01:03:57,626 --> 01:04:00,709
- And maybe I can ...
- Maybe you should wait until you win.

811
01:04:00,918 --> 01:04:03,416
Then we can talk about
that you should leave the Beekman.

812
01:04:06,375 --> 01:04:07,626
Yes.

813
01:04:09,041 --> 01:04:12,458
- Yes.
- I did not mean that.

814
01:04:16,833 --> 01:04:18,666
Give me a second.

815
01:04:55,958 --> 01:04:58,375
Oh, God ...
Clean up only, Damien.

816
01:04:58,583 --> 01:05:02,583
Sharla, which table should anatran
and lamb with broccoli to?

817
01:05:03,083 --> 01:05:05,125
- Table nine.
- Hot!

818
01:05:05,333 --> 01:05:08,583
- Hot!
- Download.

819
01:05:13,918 --> 01:05:17,041
- Okay, anatra.
- Thanks.

820
01:05:17,250 --> 01:05:19,125
Would you like some pepper?

821
01:05:19,333 --> 01:05:21,958
- Not for myself, but for my boyfriend.
- Okay.

822
01:05:23,501 --> 01:05:26,834
Say to. All right.

823
01:05:27,041 --> 01:05:30,333
He likes a lot of pepper. Thank you.

824
01:05:33,751 --> 01:05:35,000
- I'm so sorry.
- Sorry.

825
01:05:35,208 --> 01:05:36,583
Are you okay?

826
01:05:43,333 --> 01:05:44,958
- Excuse me.
- It's okay.

827
01:05:50,375 --> 01:05:52,458
This looks good.

828
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:03,501
Nick?

829
01:06:04,083 --> 01:06:05,584
Table Three.

830
01:06:19,125 --> 01:06:20,375
Nick?

831
01:06:20,583 --> 01:06:22,082
Natalia.

832
01:06:29,166 --> 01:06:30,918
Nick, what is it?

833
01:06:34,416 --> 01:06:39,041
Yeah, I just ...
I was looking for pepper.

834
01:06:40,751 --> 01:06:44,459
Seriously, you and your pepper ...

835
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,791
- What is it?
- Who was sitting here?

836
01:07:11,626 --> 01:07:13,417
Lamb-and-broccoli-guy.

837
01:07:15,250 --> 01:07:16,876
- Broccoli?
- Yes.

838
01:07:17,083 --> 01:07:20,125
You saw him, right?
And the girl he was here with?

839
01:07:34,833 --> 01:07:36,833
Are you looking for him?

840
01:07:37,958 --> 01:07:39,625
The man of your dreams?

841
01:07:41,666 --> 01:07:43,083
Hold on.

842
01:07:43,751 --> 01:07:46,167
You are the woman who sells flowers?

843
01:07:47,416 --> 01:07:51,166
- What are you doing here?
- I come here when I can not sleep.

844
01:07:51,666 --> 01:07:57,500
I saw my true love
in my dreams for seven nights in a row.

845
01:07:58,458 --> 01:08:00,000
That is how the legend is working.

846
01:08:01,083 --> 01:08:03,918
- What legend?
- Hayward fountain.

847
01:08:04,125 --> 01:08:06,291
Legend has it that throwing a coin

848
01:08:06,501 --> 01:08:10,709
- And seven nights dreaming man
of his true love.

849
01:08:11,541 --> 01:08:14,125
And if you really love him,

850
01:08:14,333 --> 01:08:18,041
- Will stones spirits
to make him real.

851
01:08:19,292 --> 01:08:21,000
It is ...

852
01:08:21,208 --> 01:08:22,541
It is pure fantasy.

853
01:08:26,333 --> 01:08:28,416
Did it happen to you?

854
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,583
Take my advice.

855
01:08:30,792 --> 01:08:35,375
Find yourself a real guy
and save yourself the pain.

856
01:09:36,876 --> 01:09:40,250
During a short period of time,
found beaver water

857
01:09:40,458 --> 01:09:42,833
-skapade ponds and found frid-

858
01:09:43,042 --> 01:09:46,292
-in a dangerous and tough ecosystems.

859
01:10:01,417 --> 01:10:03,042
Hello?

860
01:10:04,292 --> 01:10:06,042
Hello.

861
01:10:08,167 --> 01:10:10,584
Did not think I ever
would see you again.

862
01:10:11,292 --> 01:10:13,000
Here I am.

863
01:10:14,167 --> 01:10:16,042
Must be fate.

864
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,082
Really? Do you believe in destiny?

865
01:10:19,792 --> 01:10:22,375
I'll find you, again and again.

866
01:10:23,208 --> 01:10:26,626
Yes. And it feels right
When I'm with you.

867
01:10:26,833 --> 01:10:27,876
Right?

868
01:10:28,082 --> 01:10:33,583
It feels like I
can do what I want.

869
01:10:33,792 --> 01:10:38,918
- I can win brotävlingen.
- Or as I can ride me ...

870
01:10:39,125 --> 01:10:41,082
... And restore my family's restaurant.

871
01:10:41,292 --> 01:10:42,751
Just.

872
01:10:43,626 --> 01:10:45,083
What more can I ask?

873
01:10:46,542 --> 01:10:49,626
- Something real.
- But it is real, somehow.

874
01:10:49,833 --> 01:10:52,876
It's just ... not fair.

875
01:10:53,501 --> 01:10:54,833
Same thing again.

876
01:10:55,542 --> 01:10:58,876
Another night where we just go round and round.

877
01:11:00,250 --> 01:11:02,542
I'm tired of this.

878
01:11:03,833 --> 01:11:08,791
It is unrealistic. The more I see you
the harder it becomes.

879
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,583
- But you said it feels so good.
- Yes I did.

880
01:11:11,792 --> 01:11:14,209
But that is only an illusion, okay?

881
01:11:14,876 --> 01:11:19,375
Even if the legend is true ...

882
01:11:20,082 --> 01:11:22,000
We only have one more night.

883
01:11:22,208 --> 01:11:24,833
- What legend?
- Seven nights ...

884
01:11:25,042 --> 01:11:28,542
... Seven chances to dream of you,
then it's over.

885
01:11:28,876 --> 01:11:31,000
Okay, but it is not over. Not yet.

886
01:11:32,792 --> 01:11:35,042
Hoping helps nothing.

887
01:11:35,501 --> 01:11:39,501
- Stop. I wake up when we touch each other.
- Exactly.

888
01:11:40,583 --> 01:11:45,125
You're all I ever dreamed,
but you are not.

889
01:11:45,333 --> 01:11:47,708
Why do I go through this?
I must move on.

890
01:11:47,917 --> 01:11:49,500
- Stop.
- No, I must go on.

891
01:11:49,708 --> 01:11:52,833
Do not look for me tomorrow.
I will not sleep.

892
01:11:53,042 --> 01:11:56,083
What if you're wrong?
What if we can find each other?

893
01:11:57,417 --> 01:12:00,083
- You are not real.
- Natalie.

894
01:12:29,375 --> 01:12:30,917
Jessa?

895
01:12:31,125 --> 01:12:35,000
No, just a reminder for
award ceremony on Saturday night.

896
01:12:37,667 --> 01:12:40,459
This is our chance.

897
01:12:41,292 --> 01:12:44,709
Although there is
there is a future in which out-

898
01:12:44,917 --> 01:12:48,416
- Which does not have to include
Lance Beekman, because I'm completion

899
01:12:48,626 --> 01:12:50,417
-with make tråkgörat.

900
01:12:51,082 --> 01:12:56,708
If I leave now,
and choose to become self-

901
01:12:56,917 --> 01:12:58,625
-följer you with me?

902
01:13:04,167 --> 01:13:05,501
Are you ...?

903
01:13:05,708 --> 01:13:07,791
Have you any idea what it takes?

904
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,626
To arrange customers, provide office,
hiring employees?

905
01:13:10,833 --> 01:13:13,416
- Pay ... Pay the Bills?
- I know. I know.

906
01:13:13,626 --> 01:13:17,417
It will be tough, but if I win,
it will generate interest.

907
01:13:17,626 --> 01:13:19,792
- Do you expect that?
- We will be crushed.

908
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,792
Competition on price is enormous.

909
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:26,167
- So you do not think I can win.
- That said, I do not.

910
01:13:27,667 --> 01:13:30,250
I need the papers in the office.

911
01:13:32,583 --> 01:13:33,958
All right.

912
01:13:34,167 --> 01:13:36,167
Let me ask this:

913
01:13:37,292 --> 01:13:38,375
Do you like it here?

914
01:13:38,583 --> 01:13:45,541
Do you enjoy giving everything you have
to perfect Beekman-touch?

915
01:13:50,125 --> 01:13:52,833
- Yablonski, Smith and co-workers.
- No no.

916
01:13:53,833 --> 01:13:56,708
Smith, Yablonski, so you get to be with.

917
01:13:59,208 --> 01:14:00,291
Yes.

918
01:14:06,958 --> 01:14:08,333
- Damien?
- Yes.

919
01:14:08,542 --> 01:14:11,876
I have hired a new busboy,
so you get to be Deputy Director tonight.

920
01:14:12,626 --> 01:14:15,208
- Serious?
- Then you must listen to me.

921
01:14:15,876 --> 01:14:20,792
Now we run all weekend, and I
just want to say how grateful I am.

922
01:14:22,917 --> 01:14:24,625
Very good.

923
01:14:25,208 --> 01:14:28,876
- Grandpa, can we get a cookie?
- What? A cake?

924
01:14:29,082 --> 01:14:31,541
Sure, you get a cookie.
We go and find them.

925
01:14:31,751 --> 01:14:34,208
Where are they? Oh, cakes.

926
01:14:34,417 --> 01:14:35,459
Hey, hey.

927
01:14:35,667 --> 01:14:37,667
- Uncle Nick.
- Uncle Nick.

928
01:14:38,833 --> 01:14:39,958
Here they are.

929
01:14:40,167 --> 01:14:41,626
Hello.

930
01:14:42,250 --> 01:14:44,042
Glad to see you.

931
01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:46,917
Jessa, good to see you.

932
01:14:47,917 --> 01:14:49,125
Mr. Smith.

933
01:14:49,333 --> 01:14:51,166
Mike, do you remember?

934
01:14:51,375 --> 01:14:52,833
Do you remember those two?

935
01:14:53,042 --> 01:14:55,918
Hannah and Sarah,
you have been so long.

936
01:14:56,125 --> 01:14:58,208
We eat broccoli now.

937
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:07,042
Congratulations on the wedding, Charlotte.

938
01:15:07,667 --> 01:15:09,083
Mrs Smith.

939
01:15:09,292 --> 01:15:10,792
Thanks, Jessa.

940
01:15:14,792 --> 01:15:16,751
Remember to keep the floor dry.

941
01:15:17,626 --> 01:15:20,792
- Got that? In this direction.
- Everything okay for tonight?

942
01:15:21,667 --> 01:15:25,042
- I know. Classico Italiano with a twist.
- Okay.

943
01:15:25,250 --> 01:15:28,708
Twist, twist. I give you
more twist than a pretzel, huh?

944
01:15:40,667 --> 01:15:42,626
Do not be mad at me.

945
01:15:43,501 --> 01:15:44,792
It does not sound good.

946
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,958
It can be good.

947
01:15:47,167 --> 01:15:48,792
Okay, spit it out.

948
01:15:50,208 --> 01:15:54,501
I called the TV station and
urged food critic to dine here.

949
01:15:54,708 --> 01:15:56,291
- Rodney Sims?
- We're ready, Nat.

950
01:15:56,501 --> 01:16:00,708
If he hates us he digs us down
in a deep hole that we can not get out.

951
01:16:00,917 --> 01:16:03,125
No, he can not.

952
01:16:03,333 --> 01:16:05,501
This is your dream, Nat.

953
01:16:05,833 --> 01:16:08,291
And it's so good for you.

954
01:16:08,501 --> 01:16:12,417
The restaurant and Mario.

955
01:16:18,082 --> 01:16:21,250
I raise my glass to my bride.

956
01:16:25,417 --> 01:16:27,334
Charlotte, my beloved älskling-

957
01:16:27,542 --> 01:16:31,709
- You are just as beautiful today
the first day we met.

958
01:16:33,208 --> 01:16:35,000
40 years of happiness.

959
01:16:35,208 --> 01:16:37,501
- I was a child-bride.
- I know right.

960
01:16:39,042 --> 01:16:41,501
- Grandpa kisses grandmother again.
- They do that sometimes.

961
01:16:41,708 --> 01:16:44,082
I was scarred for a long time ago
the sight.

962
01:16:44,292 --> 01:16:46,626
Casanova, toddlers watching.

963
01:16:46,833 --> 01:16:48,501
- Stop.
- No, you can stop.

964
01:16:48,708 --> 01:16:52,833
- Sarah.
- Girls. You and you, outside. Come now.

965
01:16:53,042 --> 01:16:54,962
- Give them no attention.
- Now you did it.

966
01:16:55,042 --> 01:16:56,667
You emptied the room.

967
01:16:56,876 --> 01:16:59,542
You know what keeps me, Nick?
At my age?

968
01:16:59,751 --> 01:17:02,125
- What?
- The heart.

969
01:17:02,876 --> 01:17:07,167
Without the heart, there is no passion.
No passion, no life.

970
01:17:07,375 --> 01:17:10,626
And I thank my luck
that Charlotte is my passion-

971
01:17:10,833 --> 01:17:13,416
-My heart and my life.

972
01:17:15,042 --> 01:17:16,834
May you all find the same.

973
01:17:21,667 --> 01:17:24,250
It's about time. Happy birthday.

974
01:17:24,458 --> 01:17:25,876
- Congratulations on the wedding day.
- Thanks.

975
01:17:26,082 --> 01:17:28,666
Congratulations on the wedding day.

976
01:17:30,501 --> 01:17:31,751
Thank you, darling.

977
01:17:31,958 --> 01:17:33,541
Here you are.

978
01:17:35,292 --> 01:17:37,375
Can I interfere?

979
01:17:38,667 --> 01:17:41,375
You always interfere.
We know that about you.

980
01:17:41,583 --> 01:17:44,876
Your sister says
To avoid tying you-

981
01:17:45,082 --> 01:17:49,208
- Because you think you can not get
the relationship your father and I have.

982
01:17:49,417 --> 01:17:52,042
Mom, you and Dad have
is astounding.

983
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:55,458
I would love to have it so one day,
but I have not had the luck.

984
01:17:55,667 --> 01:17:59,250
Then you wait.
But do not settle for less.

985
01:17:59,458 --> 01:18:02,917
You have dreamed of the girl,
now you have to go out and find her.

986
01:18:03,125 --> 01:18:05,667
- You will not find fantasies.
- It was not what I meant.

987
01:18:05,876 --> 01:18:07,208
Do not be so literal.

988
01:18:07,417 --> 01:18:10,834
We have the old Hayward legend.

989
01:18:11,042 --> 01:18:13,667
You may be able
dream up a looker.

990
01:18:13,876 --> 01:18:16,083
- Excuse me?
- Do not listen to your father.

991
01:18:16,292 --> 01:18:18,042
- He thinks he's funny.
- You know ...

992
01:18:18,250 --> 01:18:20,667
... The legend of Hayward Fountain.

993
01:18:20,876 --> 01:18:23,167
People throw coins in fontänen-

994
01:18:23,375 --> 01:18:26,583
- And then they dream about
their true love for seven nights.

995
01:18:26,792 --> 01:18:28,834
Is it not so?

996
01:18:30,501 --> 01:18:33,292
If you can dream it, you can get it.

997
01:18:33,501 --> 01:18:35,918
Take the plunge.

998
01:18:37,167 --> 01:18:38,709
Thank you.

999
01:18:38,917 --> 01:18:40,791
But I'm not going to chase after a dream.

1000
01:18:47,375 --> 01:18:49,583
As food critic, Rodney Sims-

1001
01:18:49,792 --> 01:18:53,083
- Appears well just up,
without warning?

1002
01:18:53,292 --> 01:18:54,667
Yes, unfortunately.

1003
01:19:06,417 --> 01:19:10,000
Appeared dream boy up last night?

1004
01:19:10,208 --> 01:19:11,583
No.

1005
01:19:12,167 --> 01:19:15,083
I do not dream about
the impossible anymore.

1006
01:20:37,542 --> 01:20:40,501
Mr Beekman,
This is not working.

1007
01:20:40,708 --> 01:20:44,250
You have talent, but there are
something called rightful share.

1008
01:20:44,458 --> 01:20:46,666
I've been here for three years.

1009
01:20:46,876 --> 01:20:49,436
Do you know how long it took for me
to get my big break?

1010
01:20:49,583 --> 01:20:51,250
No, but you know what I know?

1011
01:20:51,458 --> 01:20:55,125
That it is time for me to get out
my name and my designs.

1012
01:20:55,626 --> 01:20:59,626
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but it will not happen here.

1013
01:21:00,375 --> 01:21:01,958
I know.

1014
01:21:10,501 --> 01:21:12,751
She would be proud of
what you accomplished.

1015
01:21:12,958 --> 01:21:15,833
Yes, I think so too.

1016
01:21:19,458 --> 01:21:22,626
I was awake all night yesterday
so that I would not dream.

1017
01:21:22,833 --> 01:21:24,416
Why?

1018
01:21:27,333 --> 01:21:29,125
We got seven nights.

1019
01:21:29,333 --> 01:21:32,082
Seven nights to dream,
and now it's over.

1020
01:21:32,292 --> 01:21:34,334
It's over.

1021
01:21:35,082 --> 01:21:36,791
It is already queued.

1022
01:21:37,333 --> 01:21:38,708
All right.

1023
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:52,833
Nick. Did not you get my mess?
We would eat breakfast together.

1024
01:21:53,042 --> 01:21:54,626
I waited.

1025
01:21:55,792 --> 01:21:57,626
What happens?

1026
01:21:58,958 --> 01:22:01,375
I quit.

1027
01:22:01,626 --> 01:22:05,000
The expression on the face Beekmans
when I told? Priceless.

1028
01:22:07,292 --> 01:22:10,542
Have you stopped?
Would not you wait for the award?

1029
01:22:12,250 --> 01:22:14,417
Why are not you happy for me?

1030
01:22:15,042 --> 01:22:17,167
I stopped because I wanted to.

1031
01:22:17,375 --> 01:22:19,667
I needed to do
a big change in my life.

1032
01:22:19,876 --> 01:22:22,958
But what if you do not win?
And you said that there is no prize money.

1033
01:22:23,167 --> 01:22:26,876
- It's not about money.
- I can not believe you said you up.

1034
01:22:27,375 --> 01:22:30,292
Do not do that. Not now.

1035
01:22:32,833 --> 01:22:35,041
I just want what's best for you.

1036
01:22:36,042 --> 01:22:38,334
What is best for us.

1037
01:22:50,417 --> 01:22:54,042
I'm sorry. Your table is ready
for a few minutes, I promise.

1038
01:22:54,250 --> 01:22:56,876
- Jamie, can you hurry?
- Yes. All right.

1039
01:22:57,082 --> 01:22:59,416
I ask again so awful
very sorry.

1040
01:23:01,542 --> 01:23:04,209
- Natalie, you're needed here.
- Okay, I will.

1041
01:23:04,417 --> 01:23:06,792
Mario, was the gnocchi to table four?

1042
01:23:09,501 --> 01:23:11,542
- Grab it.
- I dropped the pasta.

1043
01:23:11,751 --> 01:23:13,876
My finest plate.
Excuse me.

1044
01:23:14,250 --> 01:23:15,876
I dropped it almost.

1045
01:23:16,082 --> 01:23:18,750
