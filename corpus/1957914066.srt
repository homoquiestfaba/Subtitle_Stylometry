0
00:00:29,003 --> 00:00:31,506
No! No, you son of a...

1
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:32,882
- Reed!
- No!

2
00:00:32,965 --> 00:00:33,966
Reed!

3
00:00:35,092 --> 00:00:36,719
Reed, no!

4
00:00:36,802 --> 00:00:38,554
You, come here!

5
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:41,516
How many more?
Is there another team?

6
00:00:41,599 --> 00:00:45,853
Will! Will!
Leave him alone!

7
00:00:45,937 --> 00:00:48,356
Bleed.

8
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:50,816
Now, wait your turn!

9
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,953
You like it in there?

10
00:01:02,036 --> 00:01:05,039
This is the last place
you will ever see.

11
00:01:06,374 --> 00:01:08,209
Where is the other squad?

12
00:01:08,292 --> 00:01:10,795
There is nobody else.

13
00:01:10,878 --> 00:01:12,672
They thought that you...

14
00:01:39,907 --> 00:01:41,117
Who?

15
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:44,972
Survivors weren't part
of my orders.

16
00:01:44,996 --> 00:01:46,747
You wanna live?
Who gave us up?

17
00:01:50,126 --> 00:01:51,460
Turner!

18
00:02:03,806 --> 00:02:05,308
Corporal.

19
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:12,899
Secure the other weapons
and let our friends out.

20
00:02:12,982 --> 00:02:14,901
Yes, sir.

21
00:02:43,971 --> 00:02:46,140
All right, boys,
now they know something's wrong.

22
00:02:46,224 --> 00:02:47,558
I clicked off 600 meters

23
00:02:47,642 --> 00:02:49,077
from the gate
when they brought us in.

24
00:02:49,101 --> 00:02:51,020
There was a comm cent
and a barracks.

25
00:02:51,103 --> 00:02:53,356
Give them 15 to arm and rally,
90 to run.

26
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:55,042
And don't forget about
the two in the towers.

27
00:02:55,066 --> 00:02:56,817
They're not gonna
leave their post.

28
00:02:56,901 --> 00:02:58,754
That gives us less than two
minutes till they're on us.

29
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:00,696
I'll stay with Will,
Reed and the prisoner.

30
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,115
We need whatever weapons
and packs you can find.

31
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:05,326
Rally back here, signal command,

32
00:03:05,409 --> 00:03:07,203
and go for the the evac point
through there.

33
00:03:07,286 --> 00:03:08,204
Copy?

34
00:03:08,287 --> 00:03:09,789
Yes, sir.

35
00:03:21,592 --> 00:03:24,053
You yell one more time,
you go out screaming.

36
00:03:24,136 --> 00:03:25,763
Will, you ready?

37
00:03:25,847 --> 00:03:28,766
My legs...
Sarge, I got no legs right now.

38
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:31,727
You got eyes?
Pick up that gun.

39
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:33,604
Yes, sir.

40
00:03:34,856 --> 00:03:36,357
Take that ridge line.

41
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,984
We'll get the radio back,
we'll be

42
00:03:38,067 --> 00:03:39,485
out of here in one minute.

43
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:41,445
Atash moves, twitch him.

44
00:03:42,446 --> 00:03:44,448
Copy that.

45
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:05,344
I called opp comm, Sergeant.

46
00:04:05,428 --> 00:04:07,013
They says it's a negative
on the evac.

47
00:04:07,096 --> 00:04:08,376
Waiting for
further instructions.

48
00:04:08,431 --> 00:04:09,765
Let me see it.

49
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:14,145
Opp Comm,
this is Sergeant Locke.

50
00:04:14,228 --> 00:04:15,855
We have wounded and intel.

51
00:04:15,938 --> 00:04:19,275
We request immediate evac
at pickup location 1. Over.

52
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,736
<i>Sergeant, we have eyes</i>
in the sky reporting back

53
00:04:21,819 --> 00:04:23,863
<i>the evac zone</i>
is too hot for pickup.

54
00:04:23,946 --> 00:04:26,782
<i>Stand by for alternate.</i>
Copy?

55
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:29,535
We can confirm,
enemy operations are down.

56
00:04:29,619 --> 00:04:33,331
The area is clear. We do not see
or hear friendly choppers.

57
00:04:33,414 --> 00:04:34,999
We gotta move now.

58
00:04:35,082 --> 00:04:38,002
<i>Hold, Sergeant.</i>
We are working on alternate.

59
00:04:38,085 --> 00:04:39,712
<i>I repeat:</i>
Hold position.

60
00:04:39,795 --> 00:04:42,673
Let me speak
to the officer in charge.

61
00:04:42,757 --> 00:04:44,675
<i>This is</i>
First Lieutenant Carpenter.

62
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:46,403
<i>- Sergeant, you have orders...</i>
- I said let me speak

63
00:04:46,427 --> 00:04:47,887
to the officer in charge.

64
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:50,723
Major Turner.
I know he's in the room.

65
00:04:50,806 --> 00:04:52,642
<i>- This is Turner.</i>
- Major Turner,

66
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:54,477
our situation has changed.

67
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,788
After escaping enemy capture,
my men and I are proceeding

68
00:04:56,812 --> 00:04:58,439
towards evac location 1.

69
00:04:58,523 --> 00:05:00,525
We have wounded and a prisoner.

70
00:05:00,608 --> 00:05:02,985
It's Atash, sir.- He's alive?

71
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:05,571
<i>Soldier, your orders</i>
were to kill on sight.

72
00:05:05,655 --> 00:05:07,323
My orders seem a bit conflicted

73
00:05:07,406 --> 00:05:09,325
from intel I just received
from the hostile.

74
00:05:09,408 --> 00:05:13,496
Just as you seem
a bit conflicted about our evac.

75
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:16,040
<i>I don't like what</i>
you're insinuating, soldier.

76
00:05:16,123 --> 00:05:18,668
You'll like it even less
when I tell it to ops, brass

77
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:22,004
and straight to your face, sir,
but I promise you this:

78
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:23,673
either you send the chopper now,

79
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:26,717
or I cross this desert
and come get you.

80
00:05:26,801 --> 00:05:28,886
<i>Twelve minutes.</i>
Evac confirmed. Zone 1.

81
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:31,097
<i>- Command out.</i>
- Copy that.

82
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,682
Let's move.

83
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:03,713
I've only been here
for a few hours.

84
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:06,883
You know what I realized?

85
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:10,344
Help is a long way away.

86
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:21,230
No. No!

87
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:22,899
No!

88
00:06:38,873 --> 00:06:40,583
Staff Sergeant.

89
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,084
I read it.

90
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:43,586
What I don't understand is

91
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:45,922
two medals, 14 commendations,

92
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:47,590
the fastest to your rank
I've seen...

93
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:49,425
and you want to go with this?

94
00:06:50,885 --> 00:06:53,471
Yes, sir.
I do, sir.

95
00:06:54,764 --> 00:06:56,974
Won't stick.
Not enough of it.

96
00:06:57,058 --> 00:06:58,893
Not without Atash.

97
00:06:58,976 --> 00:07:00,770
And Turner has connections.

98
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:02,396
I know.

99
00:07:08,444 --> 00:07:10,363
Every day I wake up...

100
00:07:10,446 --> 00:07:11,697
Granted.

101
00:07:11,781 --> 00:07:14,283
I thank God.

102
00:07:16,244 --> 00:07:19,038
<i>I know he has angels</i>
watching over me...

103
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:23,417
<i>and over all my brothers</i>
and my sisters.

104
00:07:23,501 --> 00:07:25,837

Thank you for protecting him,

135
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:54,091
as we thank him
for protecting us.

136
00:08:54,175 --> 00:08:56,886
A blessing on his life
as he starts again...

137
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:04,560
and hold those that have passed
from this world close to you.

138
00:09:06,562 --> 00:09:08,064
Amen.

139
00:10:29,312 --> 00:10:33,107
I need a job.
Thoughts?

140
00:10:33,191 --> 00:10:35,234
Wait till it's light outside.

141
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:39,822
Okay.

142
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:50,059
Hey! Roland!

143
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:51,853
Stop! Stop! Stop!

144
00:11:51,936 --> 00:11:54,355
What do you think you're doing?

145
00:11:54,438 --> 00:11:57,149
You don't skip my class.
Not my class.

146
00:11:57,233 --> 00:12:00,403
You have three minutes
to get back to the center

147
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:01,946
before I call your parents.

148
00:12:02,029 --> 00:12:03,531
Go.

149
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,412
Kids.

150
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:12,665
You take your eyes off of them
for a second, and just chaos.

151
00:12:12,748 --> 00:12:14,208
Thank you.

152
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:16,836
Yeah, I'm crazy,

153
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:19,005
and you're kidding kids.

154
00:12:29,223 --> 00:12:31,100
- Dang! Marian!
- What?

155
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:33,603
- Stop hitting me.
- Who are you?

156
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:35,688
- I'm a friend.
- I don't know you.

157
00:12:35,771 --> 00:12:38,274
If I were trying to hurt you,
I'd be swinging,

158
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:40,359
and I wouldn't be wearing
a suit.

159
00:12:44,071 --> 00:12:45,573
You changed.

160
00:12:45,656 --> 00:12:48,367
You haven't.

161
00:12:48,451 --> 00:12:51,412
No, not yet.
Sent my resumes out.

162
00:12:51,495 --> 00:12:53,581
Had a couple interviews.

163
00:12:53,664 --> 00:12:55,208
Times have been better.

164
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:57,418
Seems that way.

165
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:01,297
You know,
those were serious people

166
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,549
you stepped in front
of back there.

167
00:13:03,633 --> 00:13:05,259
- Not that you're not serious.
- Oh.

168
00:13:05,343 --> 00:13:07,428
Will you stop complaining?
I got you ice cream.

169
00:13:07,512 --> 00:13:10,139
I know, I know,
I know. Okay?

170
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:12,517
You know,
I used to run with my set

171
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,310
back in the day.

172
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:16,229
Yeah, I remember.

173
00:13:16,312 --> 00:13:19,357
It's the look in their eyes.

174
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,442
Fire. Death.

175
00:13:21,526 --> 00:13:24,320
It's almost like
they want the pain.

176
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:27,365
For you, for them.
It doesn't matter.

177
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:31,744
Is that why you left?

178
00:13:31,827 --> 00:13:34,080
I couldn't do it to him anymore.

179
00:13:34,163 --> 00:13:36,958
I mean, my uncle was
staying up late every night.

180
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:38,709
He was wondering
if I was gonna come home

181
00:13:38,793 --> 00:13:41,087
or if CPD was gonna come
knocking on his door

182
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,713
and he was gonna have to bury me

183
00:13:42,797 --> 00:13:44,966
next to his sister
and my father.

184
00:13:45,049 --> 00:13:46,467
So I joined up

185
00:13:46,551 --> 00:13:48,845
and decided to get an education.

186
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:50,513
And I figured
that if something happened

187
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:54,433
on the battlefield,
at least I'd die for something.

188
00:13:56,644 --> 00:13:58,521
And now you're back.

189
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:00,606
I got that old feeling again,
I guess.

190
00:14:02,358 --> 00:14:05,486
A soldier can't win
if he's fighting for money

191
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:08,364
or power... nothing.

192
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:14,704
I know who those guys were
back there.

193
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:17,206
The community center
is not a fix, R.J.

194
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,458
It's a distraction.

195
00:14:19,542 --> 00:14:21,377
Hope, maybe.

196
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:24,297
Roland, the youngest one,

197
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,048
when he first came in
with his mom

198
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:27,592
to take an art class,
I asked him,

199
00:14:27,675 --> 00:14:29,760
"Do you want to be an artist
when you grow up?"

200
00:14:29,844 --> 00:14:32,138
He said he wouldn't live
that long.

201
00:14:34,891 --> 00:14:37,185
I don't accept that.

202
00:14:37,268 --> 00:14:39,604
So those of us who can do,
we teach,

203
00:14:39,687 --> 00:14:41,898
we take them to museums,
take them fishing.

204
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:44,066
Just get 'em out, like you.

205
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,568
We can't fight all the gangs,

206
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:47,361
but we can push 'em back
a couple blocks

207
00:14:47,445 --> 00:14:49,197
and give these kids
some room to breathe.

208
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,830
Uh, one moment.

209
00:14:57,914 --> 00:14:59,999
Did Roland and Eddie
make it back?

210
00:15:00,082 --> 00:15:02,210
Yes, they did.
They're inside.

211
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:08,257
I gotta... But maybe you can
come to the center sometime,

212
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:09,467
talk to the kids.

213
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,719
I mean, a real army hero
like you.

214
00:15:11,802 --> 00:15:13,763
They'd love to see that.

215
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,598
I'd love to.

216
00:16:06,607 --> 00:16:09,777
L.D. on the track.

217
00:16:09,861 --> 00:16:12,071

218

Meet some friends, bro?

Do white people actually think
that sounds okay?

Man, answer the question.

00:16:59,702 --> 00:17:00,870
I'm goin' to the store.

- For juice.

227

Juice? Why you so nervous?

228
00:17:04,707 --> 00:17:08,252
I'm nervous? Look, man,
I'm just taking a walk.

Pull your hood down

I haven't done anything, man.

Come on, man.
You good? Let's go.

232
00:17:46,874 --> 00:17:48,668
I'm sorry, Uncle Richard.

233
00:17:48,751 --> 00:17:50,586
Trouble sleeping?

234
00:17:51,629 --> 00:17:53,005
A bit, yeah.

235
00:17:53,089 --> 00:17:55,258
Take my advice.

236
00:17:55,341 --> 00:17:58,386
Don't go out at midnight
in this neighborhood.

237
00:17:58,469 --> 00:18:00,054
Nothing settling about that.

238
00:18:00,137 --> 00:18:01,931
I didn't mean to wake you,

239
00:18:02,932 --> 00:18:04,642
worry you, but the cops,

240
00:18:04,725 --> 00:18:07,186
they grabbed me and threw me
up against a wall for no reason.

241
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:09,355
Dressed like that,
I'm not surprised.

242
00:18:09,438 --> 00:18:13,109
A young black man in the
middle of the night in a hood?

243
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:16,153
They can't tell you
from the outlaws around here.

244
00:18:16,237 --> 00:18:18,114
You're lucky
they "talked" to you.

245
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:20,283
I got away.
I don't think they saw me.

246
00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:24,453
But when I was running back,
there were women and children.

247
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:27,039
In the yards?
Gathered by the fences?

248
00:18:27,123 --> 00:18:28,916
It's the only safe place.

249
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,502
People hear fighting, commotion,

250
00:18:31,586 --> 00:18:34,547
they head to the backyard
before the shooting starts.

251
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:37,300
They don't want their babies
to get hit with a stray bullet.

252
00:18:38,968 --> 00:18:40,469
How often is that?

253
00:18:42,972 --> 00:18:45,474
That's no way to live.

254
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:47,685
I'm glad you're okay, son.

255
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,653
Yeah, about 3:00.

256
00:18:58,779 --> 00:19:00,281
Okay.

257
00:19:14,629 --> 00:19:17,798
Over here.
Further east.

258
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:27,517
There he is.
Right there. Stop!

259
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,354
Hey!
Marian said you were home.

260
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:33,523
I was over
at Mrs. Hill's place

261
00:19:33,606 --> 00:19:34,941
dropping off her dinner.

262
00:19:35,024 --> 00:19:36,776
Poor thing broke her ankle.

263
00:19:36,859 --> 00:19:38,694
Mrs. Fitzwalter,
it's nice to see you.

264
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:41,447
No, it is nice to see you.

265
00:19:41,531 --> 00:19:44,408
And thank you so much
for your service.

266
00:19:44,492 --> 00:19:46,494
Now where you going
looking so good?

267
00:19:46,577 --> 00:19:49,163
I have an interview down on
43rd and Newton in 20 minutes.

268
00:19:49,247 --> 00:19:52,166
Mr. Gill's place.
The accounting job?

269
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,919
Well, you tell him that I said
you're perfect for it.

270
00:19:55,002 --> 00:19:56,838
You know, him and I go way back.

271
00:19:56,921 --> 00:19:59,173
It wouldn't hurt.
Not at all.

272
00:19:59,257 --> 00:20:01,509
And dressed this clean...

273
00:20:01,592 --> 00:20:04,345
Honey, you make sure you stop
by the block on your way home

274
00:20:04,428 --> 00:20:06,389
and maybe I'll take you
out to lunch

275
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:07,974
and show you off as my own.

276
00:20:08,057 --> 00:20:10,226
- Is your shop still...
- On 38th?

277
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:13,479
Mm-hmm. Right next to
the community center,

278
00:20:13,563 --> 00:20:16,774
and I know you know
where that is.

279
00:20:16,858 --> 00:20:18,901
Honey, I'm still doing
hair, nails and gossipin'

280
00:20:18,985 --> 00:20:20,736
from 8:00 to 8:00 every day.

281
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,823
Except on Sundays. Gotta give
God some of my time.

282
00:20:23,906 --> 00:20:25,491
- Yes, you do.
- Yes.

283
00:20:25,575 --> 00:20:27,493
Well, listen.
You go ahead,

284
00:20:27,577 --> 00:20:30,121
'cause you can't be late and
expect them folks to hire you.

285
00:20:30,204 --> 00:20:32,081
Go on. All right.

286
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:35,418
And listen, tell your uncle
I said hello, okay?

287
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:37,295
- Okay.
- All right.

288
00:20:37,378 --> 00:20:39,589
Mm-mmm!

289
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:41,465
Boy, that apple there

290
00:20:41,549 --> 00:20:44,594
sure came
from the same fine orchard.

291
00:20:44,677 --> 00:20:45,803
Mm!

292
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:16,918
It's light.

293
00:21:18,294 --> 00:21:20,004
Nation, you didn't
even count it.

294
00:21:22,089 --> 00:21:24,550
I don't need to count it
to know that you're scared.

295
00:21:32,141 --> 00:21:34,018
Sunday. Four.

296
00:21:34,101 --> 00:21:35,436
Four?

297
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:42,652
When I sold you the block,
you agreed to my terms. Yeah?

298
00:21:42,735 --> 00:21:45,154
If you need more enforcers
or carriers.

299
00:21:45,238 --> 00:21:47,323
Recruit them.

300
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:49,408
Sunday. Four.

301
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,703
If you're late,

302
00:21:52,787 --> 00:21:56,332
I'll have 10 Kings find you
and beat you for two minutes.

303
00:21:56,415 --> 00:22:00,670
The other Incas will find you,
finish you off,

304
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:02,755
and I'll give them your block.

305
00:22:04,382 --> 00:22:05,883
Do you understand?

306
00:22:07,218 --> 00:22:08,719
Yes, Nation.

307
00:22:11,889 --> 00:22:13,975
Leave.

308
00:22:26,654 --> 00:22:29,699
- Hello, everyone.
- Hi, Marian.

309
00:22:29,782 --> 00:22:31,659
- Got your homework?
- Yeah.

310
00:22:31,742 --> 00:22:34,453
Good, 'cause you guys are being
real nice and you had me scared.

311
00:22:34,537 --> 00:22:36,181
I'm like, "Maybe they don't
have their homework."

312
00:22:36,205 --> 00:22:37,933
- Can I see you, please?
- Yeah. Be right back.

313
00:22:37,957 --> 00:22:40,877
Bye.

314
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,212
Everything with the home...

315
00:22:43,296 --> 00:22:44,881
Have you been shot before?

316
00:22:44,964 --> 00:22:46,340
Never been shot.

317
00:22:46,424 --> 00:22:47,842
You ever lose a friend?

318
00:22:47,925 --> 00:22:50,887
It's an interesting feeling.

319
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:53,723
Feel a little conflicted.
You just...

320
00:22:53,806 --> 00:22:56,350
You know it's part of the job.

321
00:22:56,434 --> 00:22:59,729
It was rough.
You know, I just, uh...

322
00:22:59,812 --> 00:23:03,900
Makes you kind of think how...
how fragile life is.

323
00:23:05,568 --> 00:23:08,112
You know, he was
there in the morning,

324
00:23:08,196 --> 00:23:10,031
there with me when we left,

325
00:23:10,114 --> 00:23:11,908
and then he was gone.

326
00:23:16,412 --> 00:23:18,748
All right, girls, let's go.

327
00:23:18,831 --> 00:23:20,917
Be good, girls.

328
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,003
Great job today.
Good night.

329
00:23:28,591 --> 00:23:30,551
Marian, thank you.

330
00:23:30,635 --> 00:23:32,929
No, thank you for coming...

331
00:23:33,012 --> 00:23:35,348
No, no.
Those kids are amazing.

332
00:23:36,516 --> 00:23:38,100
They teach you.

333
00:23:38,184 --> 00:23:41,604
They asked me questions
I've never even thought of.

334
00:23:41,687 --> 00:23:43,231
So maybe you'll come back.

335
00:23:43,314 --> 00:23:44,482
Definitely.

336
00:23:45,816 --> 00:23:48,152
Yeah.

337
00:23:48,236 --> 00:23:50,988
You only got one life, man.

338
00:23:51,072 --> 00:23:53,616
<i>You got a dream,</i>
you better follow it.

339
00:23:53,699 --> 00:23:55,493

Chulo?

383
00:25:48,147 --> 00:25:49,607
Hey, stop.

384
00:26:22,473 --> 00:26:24,642
Did they take the money?

385
00:26:24,725 --> 00:26:27,311
You found him like that?
You don't know what happened?

386
00:26:27,395 --> 00:26:29,564
Don't lie to me!

387
00:26:29,647 --> 00:26:32,316
I swear to God.
Get outta here!

388
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,527
Get outta here!

389
00:27:11,063 --> 00:27:12,190
What the hell?

390
00:27:23,951 --> 00:27:25,661
I give you the gun.

391
00:27:25,745 --> 00:27:27,413
You protect the block, eh?

392
00:27:29,457 --> 00:27:32,877
Because two blocks
away from here,

393
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,879
they're robbing me blind.

394
00:27:37,548 --> 00:27:39,675
Mira.

395
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:41,260
What did you see?

396
00:27:43,221 --> 00:27:45,515
Don't play with me.

397
00:27:45,598 --> 00:27:47,934
I'm not playing with you.

398
00:27:48,017 --> 00:27:49,519
What did you hear?

399
00:27:55,274 --> 00:27:57,276
You can't use your eyes.

400
00:27:58,486 --> 00:27:59,987
Close them.

401
00:28:49,287 --> 00:28:51,163
Hey.

402
00:28:51,247 --> 00:28:52,957
You look exhausted.

403
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:56,419
They took my blood, my piss

404
00:28:56,502 --> 00:28:58,337
and my pants.

405
00:28:58,421 --> 00:29:00,214
When you let 'em
take your pants,

406
00:29:00,298 --> 00:29:02,592
it's 'cause you ain't
goin anywhere for a while.

407
00:29:04,343 --> 00:29:06,304
I thought I lost you
out there tonight.

408
00:29:06,387 --> 00:29:09,348
No, son. I'm with you.

409
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,769
- I'm with you.
- Sorry.

410
00:29:13,853 --> 00:29:17,064
The doctor had me give him
something to help him sleep.

411
00:29:17,148 --> 00:29:19,567
No, it's okay.

412
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:21,652
He needs his rest.

413
00:29:21,736 --> 00:29:23,738
Thank you for being with him.

414
00:29:25,031 --> 00:29:27,867
Your father's a good man.

415
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:29,827
Yeah.

416
00:29:29,911 --> 00:29:31,412
He is.

417
00:29:44,383 --> 00:29:46,761
So you said you found the
money right there at the door?

418
00:29:46,844 --> 00:29:48,888
Yeah, I find it
when I open the door.

419
00:29:48,971 --> 00:29:50,782
Okay. Did you see anybody
walking around the neighborhood

420
00:29:50,806 --> 00:29:52,183
or anything like that?

421
00:29:52,266 --> 00:29:53,976
Was like 6'2",
something like me.

422
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:56,729
Nobody...
Any guy with a hood on?

423
00:29:56,812 --> 00:29:58,940
Maybe possibly a tall guy?

424
00:30:01,817 --> 00:30:05,738
Well, this is a surprise.
People waiting to get in here.

425
00:30:05,821 --> 00:30:08,282
Problem is,
we're too old to learn anything.

426
00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:11,869
Alderman Lackland, this is...

427
00:30:11,953 --> 00:30:13,454
The lady and I have met.

428
00:30:13,538 --> 00:30:14,997
Alderman Lackland.

429
00:30:15,081 --> 00:30:16,499
Marian.

430
00:30:16,582 --> 00:30:18,876
John. Please, both of you
call me John.

431
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,628
We're family here.

432
00:30:20,711 --> 00:30:23,840
Besides, I'm not that old.

433
00:30:23,923 --> 00:30:26,133
John has been one of the
center's biggest supporters.

434
00:30:26,217 --> 00:30:27,969
Made it a big issue
in his last campaign

435
00:30:28,052 --> 00:30:29,345
and helped get the doors open.

436
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:31,180
You want to tend
to the families,

437
00:30:31,264 --> 00:30:33,099
you have to take care
of the neighborhood,

438
00:30:33,182 --> 00:30:34,809
watch the children.

439
00:30:34,892 --> 00:30:37,144
We can't have this mess
like we did last night.

440
00:30:37,228 --> 00:30:39,689
No one's safe.

441
00:30:39,772 --> 00:30:41,315
Did they say what caused it?

442
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:43,860
Not what. Who.

443
00:30:43,943 --> 00:30:46,529
Some banger in a hood.
Rival gang.

444
00:30:46,612 --> 00:30:48,364
Maybe Deuces.

445
00:30:48,447 --> 00:30:51,367
Held up a corner enforcer.
Took the money, the drugs.

446
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:53,244
Big score.

447
00:30:53,327 --> 00:30:57,248
Killed a couple of Latin Kings
in the shootout, I heard.

448
00:30:57,331 --> 00:30:59,876
Terrible. I know.

449
00:30:59,959 --> 00:31:01,711
They'll find him.

450
00:31:01,794 --> 00:31:03,504
You don't come into Kings land

451
00:31:03,588 --> 00:31:05,840
and raid the hens
without someone having to pay.

452
00:31:05,923 --> 00:31:09,343
I talked to the precinct,
uh, Sheriff Brewer.

453
00:31:09,427 --> 00:31:11,345
They're gonna add
some presence around here

454
00:31:11,429 --> 00:31:13,973
until he's caught
or the Kings kill him.

455
00:31:15,474 --> 00:31:17,435
I should go.

456
00:31:17,518 --> 00:31:19,729
Push my soapbox somewhere else.

457
00:31:20,771 --> 00:31:23,274
John, thank you for coming.

458
00:31:23,357 --> 00:31:26,861
- Always welcome.
- Least I could do.

459
00:31:26,944 --> 00:31:29,030
You tell your mother
I said hello.

460
00:31:29,113 --> 00:31:31,282
I'll do that.

461
00:31:31,365 --> 00:31:32,575
R.J.?

462
00:31:32,658 --> 00:31:34,410
I'll pray for your uncle.

463
00:31:34,493 --> 00:31:36,370
Thank you, sir.

464
00:31:36,454 --> 00:31:37,580
John.

465
00:31:37,663 --> 00:31:39,165
Thank you, John.

466
00:31:40,833 --> 00:31:43,002
R.J., I'm so sorry.
How's he doing?

467
00:31:43,085 --> 00:31:45,421
It's his heart
more than anything.

468
00:31:45,505 --> 00:31:49,008
Years of high blood pressure,
and it finally caught up to him.

469
00:31:49,091 --> 00:31:51,069
Are you going down there?
I could get someone to...

470
00:31:51,093 --> 00:31:53,846
No. I'm just gonna
let him rest.

471
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:56,307
I was actually hoping you'd
let me hang out here for a bit.

472
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:58,267
Sure. Of course.

473
00:31:58,351 --> 00:32:01,229
I don't know how many kids
we'll be having today.

474
00:32:06,192 --> 00:32:07,777
Oh, my Lord.

475
00:32:08,778 --> 00:32:10,279
Oh...

476
00:32:18,746 --> 00:32:20,915
Man, this ain't nothing like
no Wu-Tang, man.

477
00:32:20,998 --> 00:32:24,126
It's not.

478
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:28,089
Martial arts
is just that... art.

479
00:32:28,172 --> 00:32:30,049
Control your breathing,

480
00:32:30,132 --> 00:32:32,552
control your body,
control your mind.

481
00:32:33,594 --> 00:32:35,471
Maybe your life.

482
00:32:35,555 --> 00:32:37,598
Millions of people
all over the world

483
00:32:37,682 --> 00:32:39,725
practice this every day

484
00:32:39,809 --> 00:32:42,311
to help them stay in shape,

485
00:32:42,395 --> 00:32:45,064
to help them relax.

486
00:32:45,147 --> 00:32:47,775
But most importantly,
to help them focus.

487
00:32:50,486 --> 00:32:52,738
R.J., when you get a chance,
I need to talk to you.

488
00:32:52,822 --> 00:32:54,657
Okay. All right, guys.

489
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:57,702
Five on five.
I'll be back.

490
00:33:08,546 --> 00:33:11,632
This is unbelievable.

491
00:33:11,716 --> 00:33:13,176
Terry, Jessie's mom,

492
00:33:13,259 --> 00:33:15,761
said that she found $100
in her mailbox.

493
00:33:15,845 --> 00:33:21,142
People are finding money
in their homes, stores.

494
00:33:21,225 --> 00:33:23,519
He must have had to dump it
before he left the block.

495
00:33:23,603 --> 00:33:25,813
What makes you think
he dumped it?

496
00:33:25,897 --> 00:33:29,192
You don't steal $7,500
from the Latin Kings

497
00:33:29,275 --> 00:33:31,652
and just gift it to people
like Santa Claus.

498
00:33:31,736 --> 00:33:33,362
What if somebody did?

499
00:33:33,446 --> 00:33:36,199
Well, then he can
do it again tonight.

500
00:33:36,282 --> 00:33:39,493
It'll definitely keep this place
open another three months.

501
00:33:39,577 --> 00:33:41,495
Mm.

502
00:33:41,579 --> 00:33:44,040
Roland stopped by
about an hour ago.

503
00:33:44,123 --> 00:33:46,751
Said your uncle was helping him
escape from the shooters

504
00:33:46,834 --> 00:33:49,170
when he collapsed.

505
00:33:49,253 --> 00:33:50,796
Thinks it's all his fault.

506
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,549
You want me to talk to him?

507
00:33:53,633 --> 00:33:55,551
I don't think he wants
to see you right now.

508
00:33:55,635 --> 00:33:56,928
I think he's ashamed.

509
00:33:57,011 --> 00:33:59,597
Where is he?

510
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,266
I sent him to get the devil
scared out of him.

511
00:34:04,185 --> 00:34:07,563
Strive for peace
with everyone...

512
00:34:08,981 --> 00:34:10,691
and for that holiness

513
00:34:10,775 --> 00:34:14,695
without which no one
will see the Lord.

514
00:34:14,779 --> 00:34:18,574
See to it that no one
be deprived the grace of God,

515
00:34:18,658 --> 00:34:21,410
that no bitter root

516
00:34:21,494 --> 00:34:24,747
spring up and cause trouble...

517
00:34:26,207 --> 00:34:31,546
through which...
many may become defiled.

518
00:34:33,381 --> 00:34:35,550
Don't do it, Roland.

519
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,681
The Lord is my helper,

520
00:34:42,807 --> 00:34:44,809
and I will not be afraid.

521
00:34:47,019 --> 00:34:49,146
What can anyone do to me?

522
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:52,191
Nothing.

523
00:34:53,693 --> 00:34:55,903
Don't turn away from the Lord.

524
00:34:55,987 --> 00:34:57,488
Roland,

525
00:34:58,865 --> 00:35:03,786
his plan and design
for your life is...

526
00:35:06,455 --> 00:35:08,708
Don't turn away from God.

527
00:35:11,419 --> 00:35:13,254
- Amen.
- Amen.

528
00:35:13,337 --> 00:35:14,630
- Say it again.
- Amen.

529
00:35:14,714 --> 00:35:17,300
Amen. So...

530
00:35:17,383 --> 00:35:19,802
Get on outta here before
your mama worries some more.

531
00:35:19,886 --> 00:35:21,137
See you on Sunday.

532
00:35:31,063 --> 00:35:32,648
Can I help you?

533
00:35:33,858 --> 00:35:35,276
No, I'm good.

534
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:36,903
Are you?

535
00:35:38,613 --> 00:35:40,448
Now, unlike some priests,

536
00:35:40,531 --> 00:35:42,283
I don't take too kindly
to strangers

537
00:35:42,366 --> 00:35:45,077
putting their hands
on little boys.

538
00:35:45,161 --> 00:35:46,662
Now I know
you're not his father,

539
00:35:46,746 --> 00:35:48,873
so I'm gonna ask you again.

540
00:35:48,956 --> 00:35:50,625
Can I help you?

541
00:35:53,878 --> 00:35:56,214
Uh, I'm sorry.

542
00:35:56,297 --> 00:35:58,591
I met Roland
at the community center.

543
00:35:58,674 --> 00:36:00,259
He was in an incident
last night.

544
00:36:00,343 --> 00:36:03,930
- Hmm.
- He was with my Uncle Richard.

545
00:36:05,765 --> 00:36:08,684
Oh. You're Richard King's boy.

546
00:36:08,768 --> 00:36:10,269
Yes, sir.

547
00:36:11,395 --> 00:36:12,688
Sorry.

548
00:36:12,772 --> 00:36:16,192
It's all right, Father...

549
00:36:16,275 --> 00:36:18,444
Tuck. Benjamin Tuck.

550
00:36:18,528 --> 00:36:20,404
Father Tuck.

551
00:36:20,488 --> 00:36:22,323
If you don't mind my asking,

552
00:36:22,406 --> 00:36:24,075
Roland was a little upset.

553
00:36:25,201 --> 00:36:27,119
What'd you say to him?

554
00:36:27,203 --> 00:36:29,080
Same thing I say to all of them.

555
00:36:29,163 --> 00:36:32,500
"God has a plan for your life,
which is why you're still here."

556
00:36:34,043 --> 00:36:36,712
You know, that was
two different Bible verses

557
00:36:36,796 --> 00:36:38,214
you quoted back there, right?

558
00:36:38,297 --> 00:36:40,216
Yeah.
Yeah, I did forget.

559
00:36:40,299 --> 00:36:43,219
But... I thought I saved it.

560
00:36:43,302 --> 00:36:45,179
Do you believe it?

561
00:36:47,098 --> 00:36:50,309
That little boy was shot
six times last summer,

562
00:36:50,393 --> 00:36:52,186
and he's still with us.

563
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:54,272
So if God's not watching
over him,

564
00:36:54,355 --> 00:36:56,691
he's not watching
over any of us.

565
00:36:56,774 --> 00:36:59,068
Amen.

566
00:36:59,151 --> 00:37:01,237
You don't have to say that
just for me.

567
00:37:03,948 --> 00:37:06,242
I was the reason
my uncle was out last night.

568
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:08,995
He was looking for me.

569
00:37:10,454 --> 00:37:12,707
Making sure I was okay.

570
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:15,334
Yeah. I'm sorry
about what happened.

571
00:37:15,418 --> 00:37:20,214
He was here with us first,
right here in this church.

572
00:37:20,298 --> 00:37:21,883
Yeah.

573
00:37:21,966 --> 00:37:25,678
Few of us get together
three times a week.

574
00:37:25,761 --> 00:37:29,515
We pretend it's
about the budget or the choir,

575
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:31,601
but it's really so that...

576
00:37:33,436 --> 00:37:36,397
they don't know
what we're talking about.

577
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,733
Our lives are not our own.

578
00:37:40,359 --> 00:37:41,944
Fear's dictating everything.

579
00:37:42,028 --> 00:37:45,698
These kids are dealing
with drug dealers

580
00:37:45,781 --> 00:37:48,492
and gangs and...

581
00:37:48,576 --> 00:37:50,620
This is our neighborhood.

582
00:37:50,703 --> 00:37:53,331
And we don't have a say.

583
00:37:56,459 --> 00:38:00,630
It's not your fault,
what happened with your uncle.

584
00:38:00,713 --> 00:38:03,341
I've known that man
for 27 years.

585
00:38:03,424 --> 00:38:07,220
That was his choice.
And you know what I think?

586
00:38:07,303 --> 00:38:09,013
I think he wishes
he could have done more.

587
00:38:09,096 --> 00:38:12,683
I think he wishes it was him
in that hoodie,

588
00:38:12,767 --> 00:38:15,436
putting the fear into the hearts
of those bastards.

589
00:38:16,437 --> 00:38:17,980
Yeah.

590
00:38:18,064 --> 00:38:20,107
I know about that too.

591
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,818
Yeah. I mean, God bless him.

592
00:38:22,902 --> 00:38:26,572
God bless anybody
who's gonna stand up,

593
00:38:26,656 --> 00:38:28,366
even for one night.

594
00:38:31,536 --> 00:38:33,913
You got me all riled up here.

595
00:38:33,996 --> 00:38:36,499
I need to go get
some Pepto or something.

596
00:39:44,108 --> 00:39:45,443
Keep 'em running.

597
00:39:47,195 --> 00:39:50,781
Hey, how you doin', man?
Got somethin' for me, man?

598
00:39:58,998 --> 00:40:01,000
Hey, man, pull your pants up.

599
00:40:02,043 --> 00:40:03,836
Damn!

600
00:40:13,012 --> 00:40:15,848
All right, he ran right there.
He ran right there.

601
00:40:54,095 --> 00:40:56,973
Aaah!

602
00:41:08,234 --> 00:41:09,527
You're not afraid?

603
00:41:11,362 --> 00:41:14,156
Of you? No, ese.

604
00:41:16,367 --> 00:41:19,787
I don't want to hurt you. Just
give me the money and the drugs.

605
00:41:19,871 --> 00:41:22,498
Can't do that, man.

606
00:41:22,582 --> 00:41:24,667
You see, out here,

607
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:26,252
this is life.

608
00:41:26,335 --> 00:41:27,837
You take it.

609
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,841
Inca, casinca, they punish me.

610
00:41:31,924 --> 00:41:34,260
I fight you,

611
00:41:34,343 --> 00:41:36,304
I might win.

612
00:41:36,387 --> 00:41:38,222
Either way, I take a beating.

613
00:41:41,475 --> 00:41:43,227
Stop.

614
00:41:43,311 --> 00:41:47,023
Just stop.
Here and now.

615
00:41:47,106 --> 00:41:49,692
Why the hell should I listen to
anything you have to say, bro?

616
00:41:49,775 --> 00:41:53,571
'Cause I'm not your enemy,
and I'm not going anywhere.

617
00:41:53,654 --> 00:41:56,657
You think just 'cause you steal
from a couple of enforcers

618
00:41:56,741 --> 00:41:58,701
that you run Kings town, hmm?

619
00:41:58,784 --> 00:42:01,621
No. And I don't want to.

620
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:07,251
You started this life for...
your brothers.

621
00:42:09,003 --> 00:42:11,464
Now you're as scared of them
as you are of me.

622
00:42:11,547 --> 00:42:13,591
Why do you continue?

623
00:42:13,674 --> 00:42:15,510
Money?

624
00:42:15,593 --> 00:42:19,472
What if I paid you?
Come work for me.

625
00:42:19,555 --> 00:42:21,474
Take these streets back.
Give it to them.

626
00:42:21,557 --> 00:42:23,100
You can't.
You're just...

627
00:42:23,184 --> 00:42:25,436
One man taking the streets
by force?

628
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,271
How do you think
this all started?

629
00:42:30,316 --> 00:42:32,276
Just one.

630
00:42:35,029 --> 00:42:36,614
What you want from me? Hmm?

631
00:42:38,157 --> 00:42:39,700
Nothing.

632
00:42:40,701 --> 00:42:42,286
Just watch.

633
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:46,499
If I'm wrong, what do you lose?

634
00:42:46,582 --> 00:42:48,459
But if I'm right,

635
00:42:48,543 --> 00:42:51,671
we take Kings town
and give it back to them.

636
00:42:51,754 --> 00:42:54,674
You still get your money
and nobody beats you.

637
00:42:57,093 --> 00:42:59,053
Tell them it was a good fight.

638
00:42:59,136 --> 00:43:01,138
Think about what I said.

639
00:43:11,691 --> 00:43:14,694
- Sorry.
- You will be.

640
00:43:14,777 --> 00:43:16,362
Vatos locos!

641
00:43:16,445 --> 00:43:18,531
Wait, wait, wait.
It was an accident.

642
00:43:18,614 --> 00:43:22,451
No. See, an accident is when
someone gets hurt for no reason.

643
00:43:25,913 --> 00:43:29,208
I'm gonna beat you senseless for
causing trouble in my backyard.

644
00:43:34,964 --> 00:43:38,134
Good.
That makes it more fun.

645
00:43:56,402 --> 00:43:58,446
No! No!

646
00:43:58,529 --> 00:44:01,991
Juanito, you promised.
You gave me your word.

647
00:44:02,074 --> 00:44:04,160
Ma, I told you I wouldn't fight.

648
00:44:04,243 --> 00:44:07,121
But the fight, it comes to me.

649
00:44:07,205 --> 00:44:09,498
He's the one
been running around stealing.

650
00:44:09,582 --> 00:44:11,584
Casinca is looking for him.

651
00:44:11,667 --> 00:44:14,712
He finds him here,
it's bad for all of us.

652
00:44:14,795 --> 00:44:17,298
You used to run with the Kings?

653
00:44:18,299 --> 00:44:20,009
But no more?

654
00:44:20,092 --> 00:44:22,011
No. No more.

655
00:44:23,888 --> 00:44:25,598
I used to be out there too.

656
00:44:26,641 --> 00:44:28,059
A long time ago.

657
00:44:28,142 --> 00:44:29,769
But now,

658
00:44:29,852 --> 00:44:32,021
I just want this
off the streets.

659
00:44:32,104 --> 00:44:34,565
I want the same thing
you want for your son.

660
00:44:34,649 --> 00:44:35,900
For them.

661
00:44:35,983 --> 00:44:37,485
These people
will never know peace

662
00:44:37,568 --> 00:44:39,195
as long as this is out here.

663
00:44:39,278 --> 00:44:40,988
Man, go!

664
00:44:41,072 --> 00:44:43,699
Get out of here,
before I change my mind.

665
00:44:43,783 --> 00:44:46,202
Juanito, I need your help.

666
00:44:46,285 --> 00:44:48,788
Tell me who runs the Kings.

667
00:44:48,871 --> 00:44:51,958
Tell me how,
and I'll take them down.

668
00:44:52,041 --> 00:44:55,670
Take them down!
You're just...

669
00:44:56,754 --> 00:44:58,631
He wants to help.

670
00:45:00,174 --> 00:45:02,260
When you told Inca
you wanted out,

671
00:45:02,343 --> 00:45:04,178
did anyone help you?

672
00:45:04,262 --> 00:45:08,224
No! Now they follow you in
the street like you are a dog,

673
00:45:08,307 --> 00:45:09,392
an enemy.

674
00:45:09,475 --> 00:45:11,811
Ma! I...

675
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:19,068
You promised me, Juanito,
and you promised your kids.

676
00:45:19,151 --> 00:45:22,196
Now you tell him
what he wants to know.

677
00:45:23,614 --> 00:45:25,616
Juanito.

678
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:28,035
Doesn't that mean Little John?

679
00:45:50,141 --> 00:45:54,353
When you pick a fight with more
than one guy, what do you do?

680
00:45:56,189 --> 00:45:59,108
Pick the biggest guy, drop him.

681
00:45:59,192 --> 00:46:00,526
The rest will run.

682
00:46:01,611 --> 00:46:03,362
Exactly.

683
00:46:03,446 --> 00:46:05,323
Kings have hundreds of soldiers.

684
00:46:05,406 --> 00:46:06,949
They recruit them.

685
00:46:07,033 --> 00:46:11,537
Familia that comes up
from Mexico, new immigrants.

686
00:46:11,621 --> 00:46:13,372
But they're followers.

687
00:46:13,456 --> 00:46:14,874
Most don't speak English

688
00:46:14,957 --> 00:46:16,584
and aren't hard
from the life yet.

689
00:46:16,667 --> 00:46:20,630
They just need a place to sleep,
something to eat.

690
00:46:20,713 --> 00:46:23,382
Then you have the enforcers.

691
00:46:23,466 --> 00:46:25,134
They stand watch.

692
00:46:25,218 --> 00:46:27,720
They have the guns on the block.

693
00:46:27,803 --> 00:46:29,222
Above them,

694
00:46:29,305 --> 00:46:31,766
the casincas hand them
the weapons and drugs.

695
00:46:31,849 --> 00:46:34,227
It's like a snake with food.

696
00:46:34,310 --> 00:46:36,604
It rides all the way
up and down.

697
00:46:37,897 --> 00:46:39,565
The block,

698
00:46:39,649 --> 00:46:42,151
that's owned by the Inca.

699
00:46:42,235 --> 00:46:45,947
He's been around a while,
and he won't go quietly.

700
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:48,407
He paid for the block.

701
00:46:48,491 --> 00:46:50,535
He gives the soldiers a home.

702
00:46:52,161 --> 00:46:54,455
Pays the supplier and Nation.

703
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:56,958
Nation?

704
00:46:57,041 --> 00:46:59,585
Nation owns Crown Town.

705
00:46:59,669 --> 00:47:02,672
You have all these blocks
run by the Incas,

706
00:47:02,755 --> 00:47:04,841
but Nation runs it all.

707
00:47:04,924 --> 00:47:06,759
And he don't care.

708
00:47:06,843 --> 00:47:08,177
You pay...

709
00:47:08,261 --> 00:47:10,179
or you die.

710
00:47:10,263 --> 00:47:11,806
You recruit...

711
00:47:11,889 --> 00:47:14,100
or you get beat.

712
00:47:14,183 --> 00:47:16,143
Twelve vatos every month.

713
00:47:16,227 --> 00:47:19,564
Replace the old ones,
those that ran

714
00:47:19,647 --> 00:47:21,732
or muerto.

715
00:47:25,319 --> 00:47:27,280
How do I find Nation?

716
00:47:29,156 --> 00:47:31,742
Show him he's lost something.

717
00:47:31,826 --> 00:47:33,327
He will find you.

718
00:47:36,455 --> 00:47:38,791
I can't run with no one anymore.

719
00:47:38,875 --> 00:47:41,169
Not even you.

720
00:47:41,252 --> 00:47:42,879
Protect your family, Juan.

721
00:47:42,962 --> 00:47:44,755
When I come stir the nest,

722
00:47:44,839 --> 00:47:46,841
they'll come to the blocks
looking for me.

723
00:47:46,924 --> 00:47:49,093
They're scared.

724
00:47:49,177 --> 00:47:53,764
But if you help the people,
show them the way,

725
00:47:53,848 --> 00:47:55,433
take care of them...

726
00:47:56,893 --> 00:47:58,477
they will stand up.

727
00:47:59,687 --> 00:48:01,439
You go after Nation...

728
00:48:03,482 --> 00:48:05,943
I'll fight with you too.

729
00:48:08,112 --> 00:48:10,072
So what's next?

00:48:10,156 --> 00:48:12,408

Looks like
they're not showing up.

765
00:50:06,397 --> 00:50:08,191
What's in the purse?

766
00:50:08,274 --> 00:50:09,984
Are you gonna give it to me,

767
00:50:10,067 --> 00:50:11,652

768
00:50:16,574 --> 00:50:18,159

You stay here.

770
00:50:19,994 --> 00:50:23,372
Check his aim.

00:50:40,223 --> 00:50:41,933
You've not failed me.

772
00:50:42,934 --> 00:50:44,936
He's failed all of you.

773
00:50:54,654 --> 00:50:56,715
You see, a brother who cannot
take care of his family

774
00:50:56,739 --> 00:50:58,741
cannot be trusted.

775
00:50:58,824 --> 00:51:00,451
Not now or not ever.

776
00:51:00,535 --> 00:51:02,578
I am disappointed.

777
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:06,082
They can't stand
the sight of you.

778
00:51:07,291 --> 00:51:09,252
So who's gonna take his place?

779
00:51:09,335 --> 00:51:11,712
Who's gonna take care
of his brothers?

780
00:51:30,731 --> 00:51:33,317
We appreciate your kindness.

781
00:51:35,528 --> 00:51:37,947
What can we do to thank you?

782
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:40,783
Tell me what the people need.

783
00:51:40,867 --> 00:51:44,036
Can you turn water into wine?

784
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:47,290
Don't get me wrong.
We're grateful for the money.

785
00:51:47,373 --> 00:51:49,417
You are definitely
doing God's work,

786
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:53,337
but unless you have more
from where that comes,

787
00:51:53,421 --> 00:51:56,424
and plan on opening
a proper grocery store,

788
00:51:56,507 --> 00:52:01,179
our people are still gonna
starve in this food desert.

789
00:52:01,262 --> 00:52:03,389
Gotta walk three miles
in each direction

790
00:52:03,472 --> 00:52:06,851
to get fresh produce.

791
00:52:06,934 --> 00:52:09,228
Old folks,
mothers with young children,

792
00:52:09,312 --> 00:52:10,730
they can't walk that far.

793
00:52:13,191 --> 00:52:15,860
Sure, they can go
to a quick mart

794
00:52:15,943 --> 00:52:17,570
or a liquor store
to get staples,

795
00:52:17,653 --> 00:52:19,655
but that's not real food.

796
00:52:26,579 --> 00:52:28,372
Where are you going?

797
00:52:29,498 --> 00:52:31,834
To find a caravan.

798
00:52:34,754 --> 00:52:36,464
That can't hurt.

799
00:53:51,789 --> 00:53:53,875
You won't be needing that,
my friend.

800
00:53:53,958 --> 00:53:57,336
Friend? What friend?
You jacked my truck.

801
00:53:57,420 --> 00:53:59,297
A friend only takes
what's necessary.

802
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:02,592
He spares your truck
and he spares your life.

803
00:54:02,675 --> 00:54:04,177
And a friend...

804
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:06,262
Pays you for your troubles.

805
00:54:08,264 --> 00:54:10,224
Why would you rob me and pay me?

806
00:54:10,308 --> 00:54:11,726
We're not robbing you.

807
00:54:11,809 --> 00:54:15,104
- We're robbing them.
- Of the food.

808
00:54:15,188 --> 00:54:17,732
Your truck will be delivered
to a safe spot

809
00:54:17,815 --> 00:54:20,860
as soon as we take
everything that we need.

810
00:54:20,943 --> 00:54:22,820
Now, put this on.

811
00:54:25,656 --> 00:54:27,241
You're gonna count to 100,

812
00:54:27,325 --> 00:54:29,410
then walk back
to the truck depot.

813
00:54:31,078 --> 00:54:33,247
Uh-uh. No peeking.

814
00:54:33,331 --> 00:54:36,542
It's safer for you,
and it's much safer for us.

815
00:54:43,841 --> 00:54:45,426
Thank you.

816
00:54:47,970 --> 00:54:49,555
It only takes a few minutes.

817
00:54:49,639 --> 00:54:50,806
If the conversion works,

818
00:54:50,890 --> 00:54:52,808
your heart
will be back in rhythm.

819
00:54:52,892 --> 00:54:54,936
That's right.
There's nothing to worry about.

820
00:54:55,019 --> 00:54:56,479
We do this every day.

821
00:54:56,562 --> 00:54:58,648
And if your heart
stays in rhythm,

822
00:54:58,731 --> 00:55:01,192
and you start feeling better,
in three or four days,

823
00:55:01,275 --> 00:55:03,444
we'll start talking
about going home.

824
00:55:16,332 --> 00:55:17,333
Hello.

825
00:55:18,918 --> 00:55:21,796
Thank you for the donation.

826
00:55:21,879 --> 00:55:23,548
My pleasure.

827
00:55:25,758 --> 00:55:28,636
Hello. I, um...

828
00:55:28,719 --> 00:55:30,930
I'm not really sure
how this is supposed to work,

829
00:55:31,013 --> 00:55:33,432
but, um, you wanna
help me out here?

830
00:55:33,516 --> 00:55:36,352
I fee...
feel a little stupid.

831
00:55:37,478 --> 00:55:40,356
You talk. We listen.

832
00:55:40,439 --> 00:55:44,151
And, hopefully, provide.

833
00:55:44,235 --> 00:55:45,987
"We"?

834
00:55:46,070 --> 00:55:48,489
So there's more than
one of you now.

835
00:55:51,951 --> 00:55:53,369
Okay.

836
00:55:53,452 --> 00:55:55,580
So you're not really chatty.

837
00:55:57,915 --> 00:56:01,752
So how about we talk about
rituals and sacrifice?

881

Marian, I am so proud of you.

883
00:58:53,174 --> 00:58:54,258
I am.

884

it's somebody here tonight.

to our feet again.

892

893
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:25,665
that people are good.

894
00:59:26,707 --> 00:59:29,252

895
00:59:30,336 --> 00:59:32,129

01:12:18,187 --> 01:12:19,897
Some trouble with the gangs.

1061
01:12:19,981 --> 01:12:22,400
Oh, my God.
Is it Roland?

1062
01:12:25,069 --> 01:12:26,612
No! Mama!

1063
01:12:26,696 --> 01:12:28,114
What is this?

1064
01:12:28,197 --> 01:12:30,825
This is about your boyfriend
in a hood

1065
01:12:30,908 --> 01:12:32,368
stealing my money.

1066
01:13:04,358 --> 01:13:05,902
Why?

1067
01:13:07,111 --> 01:13:09,697
I don't like deals, Ben.

1068
01:13:09,780 --> 01:13:11,782
It's part of the job.

1069
01:13:14,202 --> 01:13:16,537
Nation is crazy.

1070
01:13:16,621 --> 01:13:19,081
He will tear
this neighborhood apart,

1071
01:13:19,165 --> 01:13:20,833
and you know this,
you have seen this.

1072
01:13:20,917 --> 01:13:22,376
Perhaps he will.

1073
01:13:22,460 --> 01:13:24,378
But that's part of the purge.

1074
01:13:24,462 --> 01:13:27,131
Worse a neighborhood gets,
the more funding it gets.

1075
01:13:27,215 --> 01:13:29,509
Hell, developers love to come in

1076
01:13:29,592 --> 01:13:32,970
and "save" a neighborhood
in peril.

1077
01:13:35,139 --> 01:13:38,351
I can control Nation
as long as he gets his money.

1078
01:13:38,434 --> 01:13:40,895
R.J.?

1079
01:13:40,978 --> 01:13:44,815
The idea of a man in a hood
protecting people,

1080
01:13:44,899 --> 01:13:47,652
stealing from the gangs,
giving to the poor.

1081
01:13:48,778 --> 01:13:50,988
That's not reality.

1082
01:14:01,374 --> 01:14:03,417
How's that for reality?

1083
01:14:03,501 --> 01:14:05,545
Or should I fully whip your ass?

1084
01:14:05,628 --> 01:14:07,338
No.

1085
01:14:08,881 --> 01:14:11,050
I feel you.

1086
01:14:11,133 --> 01:14:12,760
Gentlemen?

1087
01:14:16,430 --> 01:14:19,433
And I admire your faith.
I do.

1088
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:22,895
But you should know...

1089
01:14:22,979 --> 01:14:26,482
your divine purpose
is how it all ends tonight.

1090
01:14:27,650 --> 01:14:29,902
I knew you couldn't resist.

1091
01:14:29,986 --> 01:14:33,114
I trusted you
to lay it all at my doorstep,

1092
01:14:33,197 --> 01:14:34,490
and you did.

1093
01:14:34,574 --> 01:14:36,951
But now,

1094
01:14:37,034 --> 01:14:39,787
you're unnecessary.

1095
01:14:50,089 --> 01:14:51,591
Let's go. Let's go.

1096
01:14:58,556 --> 01:15:00,057
Wait.

1097
01:15:00,141 --> 01:15:02,143
What? Breech.

1098
01:15:04,937 --> 01:15:08,149
They captured 42 last night.

1099
01:15:08,232 --> 01:15:10,276
The house
is virtually unguarded.

1100
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:12,862
It's a setup.

1101
01:15:13,988 --> 01:15:17,325
So, if we're chasing,

1102
01:15:17,408 --> 01:15:19,035
where are they?

1103
01:15:23,039 --> 01:15:24,957
They know.

1104
01:15:25,041 --> 01:15:28,336
We gotta go.
You take 58th. You take Western.

1105
01:15:28,419 --> 01:15:30,087
We gotta rally the guys
at the roof.

1106
01:15:30,171 --> 01:15:32,006
We gotta go back
to the warehouse.

1107
01:15:32,089 --> 01:15:33,883
- All right?
- All right.

1108
01:15:33,966 --> 01:15:35,468
Let's go.

1109
01:15:37,178 --> 01:15:40,056
Coward.

1110
01:15:41,557 --> 01:15:43,184
Afraid to fight.

1111
01:15:43,267 --> 01:15:46,646
John, prince of the city.

1112
01:15:46,729 --> 01:15:48,814
You can't even do it yourself.

1113
01:15:53,611 --> 01:15:55,112
Not my style.

1114
01:15:56,364 --> 01:15:58,366
Don't want the hands dirty.

1115
01:16:18,845 --> 01:16:20,972
Robin! Robin!

1116
01:16:42,201 --> 01:16:45,246
Just get this car out of here.
You do it right now.

1117
01:16:45,329 --> 01:16:48,332
Do it. Right now.
Get outta here.

1118
01:16:57,216 --> 01:16:58,259
Come on out.

1119
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:02,054
I know you're there.

1120
01:17:09,770 --> 01:17:11,814
Same team.

1121
01:17:11,898 --> 01:17:14,108
Same team.

1122
01:17:30,875 --> 01:17:33,127
Kings have been up and down
the block all night.

1123
01:17:33,211 --> 01:17:35,963
We were wondering
when you were gonna show up.

1124
01:17:36,047 --> 01:17:38,466
We're here now.
What can we do to help?

1125
01:17:38,549 --> 01:17:40,301
We?

1126
01:17:41,928 --> 01:17:43,554
There's more of us around.

1127
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:46,182
How many?

1128
01:17:47,266 --> 01:17:50,186
Enough.

1129
01:17:50,269 --> 01:17:54,273
'Cause I think they're taking
more hostages tonight.

1130
01:17:54,357 --> 01:17:57,818
Saw 'em in an SUV with a woman
about 10 minutes ago.

1131
01:17:57,902 --> 01:18:01,405
Fully strapped.
We're gonna need backup.

1132
01:18:01,489 --> 01:18:02,657
Which way?

1133
01:18:06,827 --> 01:18:08,037
There.

1134
01:18:09,121 --> 01:18:10,540
We'll handle it.

1135
01:18:10,623 --> 01:18:12,667
If you can, protect the block.

1136
01:18:12,750 --> 01:18:14,418
We'll send more people later.

1137
01:18:37,233 --> 01:18:39,151
You know...

1138
01:18:39,235 --> 01:18:42,029
I was wondering whether we were
gonna get a chance to meet.

1139
01:18:43,030 --> 01:18:44,532
Now, I must admit,

1140
01:18:44,615 --> 01:18:47,034
I had something else in mind,
but you know what?

1141
01:18:48,077 --> 01:18:49,704
This will do.

1142
01:18:49,787 --> 01:18:51,539
This will do just fine.

1143
01:18:52,915 --> 01:18:55,001
You make them think
they got a choice.

1144
01:18:56,085 --> 01:18:57,879
That they can say no.

1145
01:18:59,046 --> 01:19:00,965
That they can take my money.

1146
01:19:01,048 --> 01:19:02,592
That's stealing.

1147
01:19:03,759 --> 01:19:05,261
You stole from me.

1148
01:19:06,387 --> 01:19:08,639
But despite your crimes,

1149
01:19:08,723 --> 01:19:10,892
you got it easy.

1150
01:19:10,975 --> 01:19:12,101
Tuck?

1151
01:19:12,185 --> 01:19:15,271
Marian? Mmm.

1152
01:19:15,354 --> 01:19:18,900
Your men, well, with you gone,

1153
01:19:18,983 --> 01:19:21,110
they'll run, they'll die...

1154
01:19:21,194 --> 01:19:22,987
makes no difference to me.

1155
01:19:40,630 --> 01:19:43,132
Go ahead. Do it!

1156
01:20:35,017 --> 01:20:37,854
No, no, no, no, no.
Nation está aquí.

1157
01:20:41,941 --> 01:20:45,361
- You saved me.
- They saved both of us.

1158
01:20:51,242 --> 01:20:53,202
I'm Robin.

1159
01:20:54,620 --> 01:20:55,538
Thank you.

1160
01:20:55,621 --> 01:20:56,706
No.

1161
01:20:56,789 --> 01:20:58,541
You save us.

1162
01:20:58,624 --> 01:21:01,210
You protect our streets.

1163
01:21:01,294 --> 01:21:03,087
You fight for us.

1164
01:21:08,384 --> 01:21:09,886
Ow.

1165
01:21:11,262 --> 01:21:12,930
- Ow!
- All right, man up!

1166
01:21:13,014 --> 01:21:16,058
It's already turning.

1167
01:21:16,142 --> 01:21:18,561
Cleaned it out the best
they could with what they had.

1168
01:21:18,644 --> 01:21:20,396
Yeah, you're lucky to be here.

1169
01:21:20,479 --> 01:21:22,565
Not luck. Him.

1170
01:21:28,070 --> 01:21:30,781
Nation, he's a sheriff.

1171
01:21:30,865 --> 01:21:33,784
Men, badges, everything.

1172
01:21:33,868 --> 01:21:36,287
I'm thinking ex-military too.

1173
01:21:36,370 --> 01:21:38,706
He knew exactly
how we were gonna respond.

1174
01:21:38,789 --> 01:21:41,792
He knew where to lead us
and how to hurt us.

1175
01:21:41,876 --> 01:21:43,836
So what do we do?

1176
01:21:44,962 --> 01:21:46,839
I don't know.

1177
01:21:46,923 --> 01:21:48,883
And he has Marian.

1178
01:21:50,009 --> 01:21:51,344
Tuck?

1179
01:21:51,427 --> 01:21:52,929
Dead.

1180
01:21:53,012 --> 01:21:55,431
Hit him at the church.

1181
01:21:55,515 --> 01:21:57,725
They hit the warehouse too.
It's all gone.

1182
01:21:57,808 --> 01:22:00,102
Money, weapons, evidence.

1183
01:22:03,147 --> 01:22:04,815
Marian?

1184
01:22:04,899 --> 01:22:07,735
Right out of her apartment.
I'm sorry.

1185
01:22:09,862 --> 01:22:12,406
Okay. They know about me.

1186
01:22:12,490 --> 01:22:15,076
But they have no idea
how many of you guys there are.

1187
01:22:15,159 --> 01:22:16,994
So we have two options.
Either...

1188
01:22:17,078 --> 01:22:20,456
One. Save your breath.
We finish this.

1189
01:22:22,750 --> 01:22:24,210
What are you doing?

1190
01:22:24,293 --> 01:22:27,171
You can't rob a hospital
in a flak vest.

1191
01:22:27,255 --> 01:22:28,673
Give me your shirt.

1192
01:22:45,565 --> 01:22:47,400
I'd almost given up on you.

1193
01:22:50,945 --> 01:22:52,947
Sit down, sit down.

1194
01:22:54,907 --> 01:22:57,660
He's resting.

1195
01:22:57,743 --> 01:22:59,370
I gave him a little something

1196
01:22:59,453 --> 01:23:02,164
to help him sleep
through the night.

1197
01:23:02,248 --> 01:23:04,166
You won't wake him.

1198
01:23:04,250 --> 01:23:05,810
What do you mean
you gave him something?

1199
01:23:05,877 --> 01:23:09,422
Well, I had the nurse.

1200
01:23:11,382 --> 01:23:13,467
Oh, don't.

1201
01:23:13,551 --> 01:23:15,428
They'll arrest you.

1202
01:23:15,511 --> 01:23:18,264
Nation kills Marian.

1203
01:23:18,347 --> 01:23:19,557
Sit down!

1204
01:23:20,933 --> 01:23:23,102
I said he'll be fine.

1205
01:23:25,605 --> 01:23:27,315
For a soldier,

1206
01:23:27,398 --> 01:23:30,193
you have a bit of trouble
sticking to the mission.

1207
01:23:32,028 --> 01:23:33,946
Should have been killed
at the house.

1208
01:23:34,030 --> 01:23:35,948
All of you.

1209
01:23:36,032 --> 01:23:38,201
Cleaner that way.

1210
01:23:38,284 --> 01:23:41,370
None of these ends to deal with.

1211
01:23:42,663 --> 01:23:44,207
But...

1212
01:23:44,290 --> 01:23:46,751
if that's the way it goes,

1213
01:23:46,834 --> 01:23:48,836
I'm here to play along.

1214
01:23:52,089 --> 01:23:54,467
You won't win, you know.

1215
01:23:54,550 --> 01:23:58,221
You'll try
because that's your way.

1216
01:23:59,472 --> 01:24:00,973
In the end,

1217
01:24:02,141 --> 01:24:05,311
there's just too many of them,

1218
01:24:05,394 --> 01:24:08,523
no matter how good
you think you are.

1219
01:24:10,608 --> 01:24:12,818
Maybe there's
another possibility.

1220
01:24:14,487 --> 01:24:16,280
And that's why you're here.

1221
01:24:16,364 --> 01:24:18,741
That's what I do.

1222
01:24:20,576 --> 01:24:23,996
I facilitate
what needs to take place.

1223
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:25,498
Now, Nation has a business

1224
01:24:25,581 --> 01:24:27,583
he would like
to continue running.

1225
01:24:27,667 --> 01:24:30,253
You have people you care about

1226
01:24:30,336 --> 01:24:34,215
and would like to see breathing.

1227
01:24:34,298 --> 01:24:35,883
What do you get?

1228
01:24:35,967 --> 01:24:41,889
I get to keep spinning
the plates, of course.

1229
01:24:41,973 --> 01:24:44,851
And to see that my people
and this neighborhood

1230
01:24:44,934 --> 01:24:48,312
get what they want...
what they deserve.

1231
01:24:48,396 --> 01:24:51,816
They don't have the fight
in them anymore, R.J.

1232
01:24:53,067 --> 01:24:54,944
They're tired,

1233
01:24:55,027 --> 01:24:57,697
weak, beat down.

1234
01:24:59,115 --> 01:25:01,617
What's the best
you can offer them?

1235
01:25:01,701 --> 01:25:03,703
Another war?

1236
01:25:05,788 --> 01:25:08,249
Who will survive?

1237
01:25:08,332 --> 01:25:10,960
Who can you protect?

1238
01:25:14,630 --> 01:25:16,465
Take Richard with you.

1239
01:25:16,549 --> 01:25:18,551
I can get the girl back.

1240
01:25:20,136 --> 01:25:22,138
Isn't that what really matters?

1241
01:25:24,307 --> 01:25:25,933
You're young.

1242
01:25:26,934 --> 01:25:29,145
Don't die for this.

1243
01:25:30,730 --> 01:25:32,648
Be a shame.

1244
01:25:59,759 --> 01:26:02,303
Come on. Get in there.

1245
01:26:02,386 --> 01:26:03,888
Get in there.

1246
01:26:17,401 --> 01:26:19,320
- They're moving her.
- Yeah.

1247
01:26:19,403 --> 01:26:21,155
Their best hope
is to keep her on the road

1248
01:26:21,239 --> 01:26:22,698
like they do
with their shipments.

1249
01:26:22,782 --> 01:26:24,742
We can't do a one rush
on their location.

1250
01:26:24,825 --> 01:26:28,162
There's no beating them.
Only him.

1251
01:26:28,246 --> 01:26:30,081
Where?

1252
01:26:30,164 --> 01:26:32,542
He loosened
his grip on the blocks,

1253
01:26:32,625 --> 01:26:35,127
and I'm guessing
he's gonna wanna take that back.

1254
01:26:35,211 --> 01:26:37,797
So we're talking 47th.
So, cover is...

1255
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:40,132
No. No more hiding.
Not for me.

1256
01:26:40,216 --> 01:26:42,301
We need to hit them
where they live and breathe.

1257
01:26:42,385 --> 01:26:44,929
For them,
that's drugs and money.

1258
01:26:45,012 --> 01:26:46,722
We need information.

1259
01:26:46,806 --> 01:26:48,182
And then...

1260
01:26:48,266 --> 01:26:50,142
faith.

1261
01:27:06,617 --> 01:27:09,161
Brilliant.
Keep the lab mobile.

1262
01:27:09,245 --> 01:27:10,872
You can create
and cut the products

1263
01:27:10,955 --> 01:27:12,707
anywhere it needs
to be distributed.

1264
01:27:58,336 --> 01:27:59,795
What's that,
seven, eight muffins?

1265
01:27:59,879 --> 01:28:01,339
I don't care anymore.

1266
01:28:01,422 --> 01:28:03,216
You don't even add anymore.
You multiply.

1267
01:28:03,299 --> 01:28:05,635
Oh, this close to retirement,
you think I gotta worry?

1268
01:28:05,718 --> 01:28:07,053
That's a lot of muffins.

1269
01:28:08,596 --> 01:28:10,139
Don't move.

1270
01:28:17,104 --> 01:28:19,941
- I got something for you guys.
- Oh, yeah? What's that?

1271
01:28:20,024 --> 01:28:22,652
- The end.
- The end? The end to what?

1272
01:28:23,778 --> 01:28:25,279
All this.

1273
01:28:29,909 --> 01:28:31,994
Whoa! Hey.

1274
01:28:41,337 --> 01:28:44,048
What? What's that?

1275
01:28:44,131 --> 01:28:45,591
Track it.

1276
01:28:45,675 --> 01:28:47,301
Follow it to the source.

1277
01:28:47,385 --> 01:28:49,887
The drugs. The lab.

1278
01:28:49,971 --> 01:28:51,848
Bring everybody you got.

1279
01:28:51,931 --> 01:28:54,016
'Cause they're not gonna stop
unless you make 'em.

1280
01:28:56,727 --> 01:28:58,646
- Freeze!
- Don't. Stop.

1281
01:28:58,729 --> 01:29:00,731
Hold it right there.

1282
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:09,448
Who are you?
Why are you doing this?

1283
01:29:14,537 --> 01:29:17,874
I'm just a kid from the block
who's seen and had enough.

1284
01:29:17,957 --> 01:29:21,043
I can.
So I have to.

1285
01:29:29,010 --> 01:29:32,096
Dispatch, I have something.

1286
01:29:32,180 --> 01:29:34,140
I'm gonna need
detective assistance.

1287
01:29:34,223 --> 01:29:35,223
Copy that.

1288
01:29:54,285 --> 01:29:55,953
Ahh.

1289
01:30:29,070 --> 01:30:31,072
What are the odds of that?

1290
01:30:32,698 --> 01:30:34,659
We locked down?

1291
01:30:34,742 --> 01:30:36,244
Chained to the bed.

1292
01:30:36,327 --> 01:30:37,787
<i>Copy that.</i>

1293
01:30:58,057 --> 01:31:00,184
Aaah!

1294
01:31:05,606 --> 01:31:07,984
Now why would you want to go
and do that?

1295
01:31:08,067 --> 01:31:10,570
You just made this
an unfair fight.

1296
01:31:12,071 --> 01:31:13,573
Did I?

1297
01:31:20,204 --> 01:31:21,747
You were right.

1298
01:31:21,831 --> 01:31:23,666
This block isn't big enough
for the two of us.

1299
01:31:31,299 --> 01:31:33,217
Seven in custody now.

1300
01:31:33,301 --> 01:31:36,012
<i>Officers in foot pursuit</i>
of two more men on Harlem

1301
01:31:36,095 --> 01:31:37,597
near the underpass.

1302
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:40,016
<i>Units 9 and 14,</i> please re-route

1303
01:31:40,099 --> 01:31:42,018
<i>to Harlem and 78th</i>
near the underpass.

1304
01:31:42,101 --> 01:31:43,728
You're done.

1305
01:31:43,811 --> 01:31:45,164
<i>Suspects from</i>
narcotics vehicles...

1306
01:31:45,188 --> 01:31:47,315
Your supply's gone.

1307
01:32:04,498 --> 01:32:06,459
I'm gonna cut it out of you.

1308
01:32:06,542 --> 01:32:08,961
Every piece
that you took from me.

1309
01:32:09,045 --> 01:32:12,048
This is <i>my</i> block.

1310
01:32:12,131 --> 01:32:14,800
No. It's theirs.

1311
01:32:14,884 --> 01:32:17,512
And when we're done,
we'll let them decide.

1312
01:33:20,616 --> 01:33:22,368
How you feeling, hero?

1313
01:33:25,037 --> 01:33:26,622
Oh, hell!

1314
01:33:29,125 --> 01:33:31,127
Get the girl.

1315
01:33:36,924 --> 01:33:39,343
No! No!

1316
01:33:42,805 --> 01:33:43,973
Get up.

1317
01:33:45,766 --> 01:33:47,560
Get up.

1318
01:34:16,589 --> 01:34:20,259
I told you.
I told you. My block.

1319
01:34:31,521 --> 01:34:33,814
Not enough room...

1320
01:34:33,898 --> 01:34:35,399
for the two of us.

1321
01:34:41,364 --> 01:34:43,658
Piece by piece.

1322
01:35:12,228 --> 01:35:14,230
Hold it right there!

1323
01:35:16,482 --> 01:35:18,234
Put it down, son.

1324
01:35:18,317 --> 01:35:20,903
You don't know
what you're doing.

1325
01:35:20,987 --> 01:35:24,448
You're just gonna get hurt,
go to jail.

1326
01:35:26,158 --> 01:35:30,079
You put it down,
or your life is over!

1327
01:35:31,873 --> 01:35:35,751
I mean, who are they
gonna believe? You?

1328
01:35:37,879 --> 01:35:39,755
Honestly.

1329
01:35:39,839 --> 01:35:41,299
No, John, no.

1330
01:35:43,342 --> 01:35:47,096
They'll believe him.

1331
01:35:47,180 --> 01:35:49,974
And, John, you'll pay.
For all you've done.

1332
01:35:50,057 --> 01:35:52,351
I'll make sure.

1333
01:35:52,435 --> 01:35:53,936
Richard.

1334
01:35:55,062 --> 01:35:57,773
I... You don't understand.

1335
01:35:57,857 --> 01:35:59,358
I do. Perfectly.

1336
01:35:59,442 --> 01:36:02,737
You sold us out,
had your friend killed.

1337
01:36:02,820 --> 01:36:04,238
And for what?

1338
01:36:04,322 --> 01:36:05,489
Money?

1339
01:36:05,573 --> 01:36:06,908
Power?

1340
01:36:07,992 --> 01:36:10,244
All I ever wanted...

1341
01:36:10,328 --> 01:36:12,413
was to provide for my...

1342
01:36:12,496 --> 01:36:15,333
Enough, John. Enough.

1343
01:36:15,416 --> 01:36:18,169
You make me sick.

1344
01:36:18,252 --> 01:36:20,713
Take one more step, Richard,

1345
01:36:21,881 --> 01:36:24,258
and I'll cut her wide open.

1346
01:36:27,637 --> 01:36:28,679
You got him?

1347
01:36:29,722 --> 01:36:31,015
Got him.

1348
01:36:34,310 --> 01:36:37,480
He moves again,
put two in his eyes.

1349
01:36:37,563 --> 01:36:40,775
But you won't move,
will you, John?

1350
01:36:43,986 --> 01:36:45,780
Because you're out of moves.

1351
01:36:48,533 --> 01:36:52,036
And snakes can't stand up,
can they?

1352
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:55,581
You got enough?

1353
01:36:57,542 --> 01:36:59,252
Absolutely.

1354
01:37:24,652 --> 01:37:26,195
Yeah.

1355
01:37:27,905 --> 01:37:31,826
Everybody has that moment...

1356
01:37:31,909 --> 01:37:36,414
<i>when the grass ain't as green</i>
as they thought it was and...

1357
01:37:36,497 --> 01:37:39,500

back and make the other choice.

1358
01:37:41,085 --> 01:37:44,881
