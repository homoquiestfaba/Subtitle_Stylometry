<i>People use the color yellow</i>

4
00:00:30,331 --> 00:00:32,231
<i>To symbolize hope.</i>

5
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:35,634
<i>Yellow...</i>

6
00:00:35,636 --> 00:00:38,570
<i>Like the sun</i>
<i>we rarely saw.</i>

7
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:41,540
<i>When I was very young,</i>

8
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:43,242
<i>I thought life would be</i>

9
00:00:43,244 --> 00:00:45,644
<i>Like one long and perfect</i>
<i>summer day.</i>

10
00:00:45,646 --> 00:00:49,681
<i>After all,</i>
<i>it started out that way.</i>

11
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:54,720
<i>We were</i>
<i>four beautiful children</i>

12
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:58,490
<i>With blond hair</i>
<i>and porcelain skin.</i>

13
00:00:58,492 --> 00:01:01,827
<i>We looked like</i>
<i>those fancy dresden dolls</i>

14
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:04,229
<i>That grace shelves</i>
<i>and mantels.</i>

15
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:06,465
<i>Only we weren't just admired.</i>

16
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:09,201
<i>We were really loved.</i>

17
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:15,140
<i>But that was before.</i>

18
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:21,380
<i>"life is full of surprises,"</i>
<i>my mother used to say.</i>

19
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:29,088
<i>And greed and fear and shame,</i>
<i>as I soon learned.</i>

20
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:32,758
<i>And hopelessness.</i>

Give them back,
christopher.

00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:27,246
Not until you quit
pounding on my wall, you freak.

[twins giggling]

30
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,716
Hey. What do you kids
think you're doing?

31
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:33,886
I don't even get a hug?

32
00:02:33,888 --> 00:02:35,387
-[laughter]
-dad!

33
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:36,588
Daddy!

00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:40,425
Oh! I missed you all
so much!

35
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:42,294
[twins]: What did you
bring us?

00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:43,595
[lid thumps]

37
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:45,297
For you, son.

38
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:46,298
Thank you.

39
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:51,370
Did you
forget about me?

00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:53,772
[chuckling]

41
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:54,806
Mm!

42
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:57,242
I could never
forget about you.

43
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:01,446
It's so beautiful.

00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,417
Oh!

[all chuckling]

51
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:44,323
I wish you never
had to go away

52
00:03:44,325 --> 00:03:45,624
For work again.

53
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:47,326
Promise me
you won't.

54
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,794
I hate to break up the party,

55
00:03:48,796 --> 00:03:50,862
But dinner's almost ready,
and I made your favorite--

56
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:52,297
Homemade apple pie.

57
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:53,498
Corrine,
you shouldn't have.

58
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,467
She didn't.

59
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:58,437
You forgot to
take off the bakery label.

60
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:01,873
Ugh. Cathy! Could never
get anything past you, huh?

61
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,442
Yeah, mom.

62
00:04:03,444 --> 00:04:04,743
What's going on?

63
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:05,944
I mean, you're wearing
a new dress and perfume.

64
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:09,448
Well, the wife
of a vice-president

65
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,483
Can't wear
just any old thing.

66
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:14,586
I was gonna wait
until it was 100% official,

67
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,355
But I got promoted,

68
00:04:16,357 --> 00:04:19,591
And I'm now the head of sales
of the entire east coast.

69
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:20,826
That's great!

70
00:04:20,828 --> 00:04:21,893
[dad]: Thank you.

71
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:23,395
[corrine]: He got promoted!

72
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,332
He's so smart, that's why.

73
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:31,770
[sniffling]

74
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:34,406
[knocking]

75
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,910
Nobody's here.

76
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,348
Cathy...

77
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,616
Hey.

78
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:48,887
[sighs softly]

79
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:50,689
This is a big
opportunity for me.

80
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:53,025
For all of us.

81
00:04:53,027 --> 00:04:55,761
I know what's
gonna happen.

82
00:04:55,763 --> 00:04:57,596
You'll be away
all the time.

83
00:04:57,598 --> 00:04:59,898
Mom will be busy
with the twins.

84
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,702
Christopher will act like
he's the man of the house.

85
00:05:03,704 --> 00:05:06,471
[sighing]
I'll be totally forgotten.

86
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:08,473
Can I tell you a secret?

87
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,776
I bought this...

88
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:12,511
On my last trip,

89
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:14,546
And it's more money
than I should've spent,

90
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:16,715
But the moment
I saw it,

91
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:19,618
I knew you
had to have it.

92
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,360
[chuckles softly]

93
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:30,529
So, when I'm traveling,

94
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:32,531
I need you
to be strong.

95
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:34,633
Can you do that for me?

96
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:44,409
Mommy!
Cathy's hurting me!

97
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:45,544
It wouldn't hurt so much

98
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:47,412
If you'd sit still
for five seconds.

99
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:48,747
Girls, please.

100
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:50,048
Your dad's gonna be home
in less than two hours,

101
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,416
I need to ice the cake,
chill the champagne--

102
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:52,517
Where are your brothers?

103
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,686
Why do I have to
wear a tie?

104
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,421
'cause we're
the "dresden dolls."

105
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:57,856
I don't wanna
be a doll.

106
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,791
It's just a saying,
darling.

107
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:01,827
Because the neighbors
think we look so perfect.

108
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:03,895
[chuckles]:
We are perfect.

109
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,768
[music plays on the stereo,
people chatter]

110
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:14,373
[d]

111
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:19,578
Why isn't
he here yet?

112
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,747
He's probably just
stuck in traffic.

113
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:23,515
When are we gonna
eat the cake?

114
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:24,716
I want it now!

115
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:25,951
Can I take off
my tie, please?

116
00:06:25,953 --> 00:06:27,052
Just be patient,
darlings, okay?

117
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:29,621
I'm going to go
freshen the ice.

118
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:30,989
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

119
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:32,791
-[car door shuts]
I hear someone in the driveway.

120
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:34,659
[excited murmuring
and bustling]

121
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:40,699
[door creaks open]

122
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:42,601
[footsteps approaching]

123
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:48,006
Mrs. Dollanganger?

124
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:51,009
I'm sorry, but, um...

125
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:54,613
There's been
an accident.

126
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:57,616
[d]

127
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:25,544
Mama?

128
00:07:25,546 --> 00:07:28,547
[d]

129
00:07:28,549 --> 00:07:30,782
Mom?

130
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,931
Alright, guys,
five more minutes.

131
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:47,999
Is daddy
coming home tonight?

132
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,072
No.

133
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:57,642
Remember? We told you.

134
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:00,745
He died.

135
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,750
Sometimes,
when I really miss him,

136
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:07,752
I just pretend
he's on a business trip

137
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:10,489
And that he'll
be back any day.

138
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,093
You guys wash up for dinner.

139
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:21,099
[footsteps]

140
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:22,734
[sighs]

141
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:27,806
Mom, um, the twins want you
to read them a story.

142
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:28,874
Is that the mail?

143
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:33,612
Madame pomfrey says

144
00:08:33,614 --> 00:08:35,780
I can't stay
in ballet class,

145
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:37,883
Unless we pay
for last month.

146
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:41,987
Are we gonna be
okay without dad?

147
00:08:41,989 --> 00:08:43,922
I'm doing
the best I can.

148
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:45,790
It's not easy
for a woman to get a job

149
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:47,993
And to support four kids
on her own.

150
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:50,128
Look at me,
I'm an ornament.

151
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,696
The only thing
I was ever good at

152
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:52,864
Was being pretty.

153
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:59,604
You know...

154
00:08:59,606 --> 00:09:01,206
You're lucky.

155
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,008
You had a dad that
thought you were special.

156
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:05,176
Because I'm just like you.

157
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:07,145
Well, in looks, maybe,

158
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:09,147
But you're more aggressive
and determined.

159
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:10,916
You're just like his mother,

160
00:09:10,918 --> 00:09:12,817
And he loved
his mother.

161
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:15,220
Doesn't everyone
love their mother?

162
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:17,889
Some mothers
are impossible to love.

163
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,058
They don't act like
mothers at all.

164
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:26,197
Have christopher read
the twins a story,

165
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:27,732
And put this in
the mailbox for tomorrow.

166
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,834
Another one?
But you already sent--

167
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:31,670
It's late.
You should finish your homework.

168
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:53,792
Cathy, christopher!
Come inside, now.

169
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:57,929
You know
all those letters I sent?

170
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:00,098
Well, I finally got a response.

171
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,133
It's all working out
as I'd hoped.

172
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:03,868
We can go live with
your grandmother,

173
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:04,869
In virginia.

174
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:05,937
What grandmother?

175
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,138
You and dad said

176
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,673
That we never
had any family.

177
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:09,674
Well...

178
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:10,976
It's complicated.

179
00:10:10,978 --> 00:10:12,978
My parents and I,
we didn't see eye-to-eye,

180
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,947
So we thought it was best
to keep our distance,

181
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,983
But with your father gone,

182
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:19,818
This is our best hope
for now.

183
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,353
What about school?

184
00:10:21,355 --> 00:10:22,954
And all
of our friends?

185
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,756
My ballet classes?

186
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:27,225
You two are old enough
to understand,

187
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:29,294
To help your mother
out of a desperate situation.

188
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:31,196
But we still
have the house,

189
00:10:31,198 --> 00:10:33,031
And I can get a part-time job,

190
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:34,299
Cathy can help out more
with the twins.

191
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:36,034
[corrine sighs]

192
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:40,805
People have
a way of believing

193
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,073
That nothing bad
can ever happen.

194
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:43,942
And your father
was doing so well

195
00:10:43,944 --> 00:10:46,244
At his job, so...

196
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:48,246
We charged
against our future.

197
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:51,082
What do you mean?

198
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:53,118
Nothing here
is really ours.

199
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,054
Not the furniture,
the cars, your toys...

200
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:59,090
N-not even
this necklace.

201
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:00,825
It's been four months,

202
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,327
And I've been
holding them at bay,

203
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,929
But the bank is gonna
come and take it all away.

204
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:06,998
Look, I know it sounds scary,

205
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,300
But I've saved the best news
for last.

206
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:11,770
My family is rich.

207
00:11:11,772 --> 00:11:14,372
Not middle-class rich,
but unbelievably wealthy,

208
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:16,975
And they have one of the finest
homes in all of virginia,

209
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:18,209
With servants,

210
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:20,045
And acres of land,
and their very own lake.

211
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:22,147
Wait till we tell
everyone at school.

212
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:24,015
We leave tonight.

213
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,150
Tonight?

214
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:27,819
It's our only choice.

215
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:29,020
I know it's hard,

216
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,022
But I promise you,

217
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,290
Whatever you leave behind,

218
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:34,893
I'll buy you a thousand more
in virginia.

219
00:11:34,895 --> 00:11:35,894
You won't miss a thing.

220
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:37,362
Don't worry, mom.

221
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:39,197
We're dollangangers.

222
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,900
We'll be happy wherever.

223
00:11:41,902 --> 00:11:44,102
I knew I could count
on you, christopher.

224
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:54,279
And one more thing...

225
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:56,314
Our name
isn't really dollanganger.

226
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:58,316
It's foxworth.

227
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:06,024
[train rumbling over tracks]

228
00:12:06,026 --> 00:12:07,826
[christopher]:
I bet the house is huge.

229
00:12:07,828 --> 00:12:09,360
I mean, you could have
your own dance studio

230
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:11,429
With costumes
and a grand piano.

231
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:13,832
I wouldn't even
hear you.

232
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:16,334
You'll be out exploring
the woods and the lake.

233
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:19,070
Way better
than any boring biology class.

234
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:21,172
Ma'am?

235
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:23,007
We'll reach your depot
in a few minutes.

236
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:24,809
Thank you.

237
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:26,211
You're sure
you wouldn't rather

238
00:12:26,213 --> 00:12:27,979
Get off
in charlottesville?

239
00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:29,013
It's 3:00 a.M.,

240
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:30,348
In the middle
of nowhere.

241
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:33,318
Oh, thank you.
We have someone meeting us.

242
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,854
Just the children's bag.

243
00:12:35,856 --> 00:12:37,789
Someone will
pick up mine tomorrow.

244
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:39,958
Thank you.

245
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:44,028
Have a good night.

246
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,231
Godspeed,
mrs. Patterson.

247
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:55,306
[engine chugging]

248
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,246
I thought you said

249
00:13:01,248 --> 00:13:02,914
There was someone
meeting us.

250
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,983
We should be there
before the sun breaks.

251
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:07,185
It's a long walk.

252
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:08,486
How long?

253
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:10,121
I can't carry
the twins.

254
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,256
Well, let them walk.

255
00:13:11,258 --> 00:13:13,792
The country air
will do them good.

256
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:20,832
[d]

257
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:28,139
[carrie]: Where are we going?
I wanna go back home now!

258
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:31,142
Just a little further,
and everything will be alright.

259
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,343
You really think so?

260
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:35,413
Yes. If that's
what mom said.

261
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,983
[d]

262
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:51,362
This is
foxworth hall.

263
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,467
[d]

264
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:13,151
Okay, cory,
blow your nose, okay?

265
00:14:13,153 --> 00:14:15,119
Okay. Good. Good.

266
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:17,388
Okay, cathy,
button this button.

267
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:21,025
[door creaks open]

268
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:26,064
Hello, mother.

269
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:27,999
[thumps door shut]

270
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:34,072
Well...

271
00:14:34,074 --> 00:14:37,075
Look what the cat dragged in.

272
00:14:51,957 --> 00:14:53,524
[grandmother]: Shh.

273
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:02,367
[d]

274
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:07,171
Shh.

275
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,927
[d]

276
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:52,417
Thank you for
taking us in, mother.

277
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:54,018
I don't know
what we would've done.

278
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,553
I'm not your father, corrine.

279
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:57,388
Your groveling
has always bored me.

280
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:01,492
I see your children
have inherited your good looks.

281
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:05,296
I just hope there's
no hidden defect or affliction.

282
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:09,167
I didn't agree
to run a circus here.

283
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:11,502
My children are perfect,
physically and mentally.

284
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:14,205
They just need some rest.

285
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:23,581
Well, the two older children
can't share a bed.

286
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,350
Cathy and christopher
are children.

287
00:16:25,352 --> 00:16:26,617
They're innocent.

288
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:30,021
Yes. That's what
I used to presume about you.

289
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,590
Well, if you're so worried,

290
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:34,392
Why don't you put them
in a separate room?

291
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:35,493
Heaven knows
there's enough here.

292
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:36,661
No, this is the only safe room

293
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,296
Where your father
can't hear them.

294
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,066
Put the two girls in one bed

295
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:43,468
And the two boys
in the other one.

296
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:53,478
And when your mother and I
leave here,

297
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,581
I will lock this room
from the outside,

298
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:59,350
And you will
keep the drapes closed.

299
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,085
And remember...

300
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:03,721
God sees everything.

301
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:08,126
God sees what evil
you do behind my back.

302
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:12,663
I'll wait for you
out in the hall.

303
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:14,532
[footsteps recede]

304
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:16,300
[door opens and closes]

305
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:22,573
Grandfather doesn't
know we're here?

306
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,377
I'm sorry, I should've
told you the truth,

307
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:29,614
But I didn't want you
to be frightened.

308
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:34,185
When I was 18, I did something
my parents didn't approve of,

309
00:17:34,187 --> 00:17:36,087
So my father
wrote me out of his will.

310
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:37,622
Is that why she hates us?

311
00:17:37,624 --> 00:17:39,290
She doesn't
hate you.

312
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:40,525
She's just jealous

313
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:42,393
Of how much I love
you guys and your dad,

314
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:44,695
How much my father
used to love me.

315
00:17:44,697 --> 00:17:48,232
That's why we're here.
I'm gonna win him back.

316
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:49,700
He's gonna put us
in his will.

317
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:52,203
He's 78 years old
and he's dying,

318
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:54,338
And I just need a little time
alone to reconnect with him.

319
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,540
How much time?

320
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:56,541
I don't know exactly.

321
00:17:56,543 --> 00:17:58,476
Maybe a few days
or a week?

322
00:17:58,478 --> 00:18:00,511
And when I win my father over,

323
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:02,480
I'm gonna take you all
down to meet him,

324
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:04,449
And I know he'll love each
and every one of you

325
00:18:04,451 --> 00:18:05,516
Just as much as I do.

326
00:18:05,518 --> 00:18:06,684
We'll be fine up here.

327
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:09,153
We're foxworths.

328
00:18:09,155 --> 00:18:11,089
[relieved sigh]

329
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:14,425
And tomorrow,

330
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:15,626
I'll bring toys and games,

331
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:17,462
And I'll come visit you
as much as I can.

332
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:19,297
And just whatever you do,

333
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:21,466
Don't make your grandmother
angry, okay?

334
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:23,734
Corrine!

335
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:27,271
What is that
on that child's hand?

336
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:29,307
It's a promise ring,
from my father.

337
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:31,609
Give it to me.

338
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:34,178
Mom, she can't.

339
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,580
Dad gave it to me.

340
00:18:35,582 --> 00:18:36,714
I said, give it
to me, girl!

341
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:43,187
Or must I speak
more...

342
00:18:43,189 --> 00:18:45,523
Slowly?

343
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,262
[d]

344
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:58,369
And don't you ever mention
your father in this house again.

345
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,740
[huffs] come on, corrine,
that's enough.

346
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:04,375
[whispers]: I'm sorry.

347
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:06,444
I promise, all our dreams
are gonna come true.

348
00:19:06,446 --> 00:19:08,613
Just trust me.

349
00:19:08,615 --> 00:19:10,615
[smooch]

350
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:11,749
[smooch]

351
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:13,718
[d]

352
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,685
[cory]: Where's the sun?

353
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:48,686
Is it still night?

354
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:49,654
Cory! Don't.

355
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:58,596
Your food.

356
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:03,301
Uh! Uh-uh-uh.
Get your hands off that.

357
00:20:03,303 --> 00:20:05,703
That food has to last you
the entire day.

358
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,738
I can't be running
up and down the stairs.

359
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,841
The servants
might get suspicious.

360
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:14,645
There'll be eggs for breakfast,
sandwiches for lunch,

361
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:15,813
And chicken for dinner,

362
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:17,415
And I want you
to eat all of it.

363
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:19,817
Don't waste one bite of it,
you understand?

364
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,787
And if you're very good,

365
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:24,789
I may bring you
some fruit.

366
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:25,990
Thank you.

367
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:31,495
I've written out
a list of other rules.

368
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:34,432
First of all, you'll keep
this room neat and tidy,

369
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:36,601
As if nobody lived here.

370
00:20:36,603 --> 00:20:38,669
Keep your hair brushed neatly,

371
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:42,707
And your bodies clean
and fully clothed.

372
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:45,643
And be modest
when you go to the bathroom.

373
00:20:45,645 --> 00:20:50,281
Girls and boys are never to use
the bathroom at the same time.

374
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:54,919
You older children will
keep the younger ones quiet.

375
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:57,822
No running around
or yelling or crying,

376
00:20:57,824 --> 00:20:59,824
They're good kids,

377
00:20:59,826 --> 00:21:02,393
But they need somewhere
to play and make noise.

378
00:21:02,395 --> 00:21:05,630
Ah. Over here, there's a...

379
00:21:05,632 --> 00:21:07,365
Stairway.

380
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:09,600
Leads up to the attic.

381
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:11,435
You want us
to play in an attic?

382
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:13,537
Up there,
there will be ample room.

383
00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:16,707
And, the last Friday
of every month,

384
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:19,277
You're to clean out
all of your things

385
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:20,578
And hide up there

386
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,779
While the maids
are cleaning this room.

387
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:27,351
No one must ever see
or hear you.

388
00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:29,520
Do you understand?

389
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:32,556
Good.

390
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:37,361
Because if your grandfather ever
discovered that you're here,

391
00:21:37,363 --> 00:21:40,398
You'd all be thrown out
without a red cent,

392
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,435
But not before getting punished
for even being alive.

393
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:52,443
[d]

394
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:18,569
[d]

395
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:33,918
Carrie...

396
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,920
You can dress up
for days in here.

397
00:22:35,922 --> 00:22:37,688
Hey, cor',
check it out.

398
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,790
You finally get
your own record player.

399
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:41,392
But it doesn't
have a plug.

400
00:22:41,394 --> 00:22:42,860
You just have to crank it.

401
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:47,465
[music begins to crackle]

402
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,435
Better hope you inherit
from this half of the gene pool.

403
00:22:51,437 --> 00:22:54,505
Like you
know anything.

404
00:22:54,507 --> 00:22:57,808
[d]

405
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,777
Our entire family.

406
00:22:59,779 --> 00:23:02,680
They're all grumpy!
Like our grandma.

407
00:23:02,682 --> 00:23:04,782
They're not grumpy.

408
00:23:04,784 --> 00:23:06,817
Guys! You gotta
come check this out.

409
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:09,153
[d]

410
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:16,494
Looks we weren't
the first kids up here.

411
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,030
[carrie]:
It's hot and dusty.

412
00:23:20,032 --> 00:23:21,499
I don't like it.

413
00:23:21,501 --> 00:23:22,700
It's not so bad.

414
00:23:22,702 --> 00:23:24,435
I wanna go outside
in the garden.

415
00:23:24,437 --> 00:23:25,569
This is a bad place.

416
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:26,737
I want mama!

417
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:29,573
Okay, we're gonna
make this a game.

418
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:31,675
Pretend
we're outside.

419
00:23:31,677 --> 00:23:32,943
The floor can
be the garden,

420
00:23:32,945 --> 00:23:35,079
And the ceiling
can be the sky,

421
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:37,648
And I'll even
make a swing.

422
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,889
What do you think
she meant,

423
00:23:44,891 --> 00:23:48,726
Grandfather punishing us
for even being alive?

424
00:23:48,728 --> 00:23:50,094
She's just
trying to scare us.

425
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:51,962
Then how come she said
we'd be here for months?

426
00:23:51,964 --> 00:23:53,497
Quit worrying.

427
00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:55,499
Mom's gonna take care of us.

428
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:02,706
-[snap]
-[gasp]

429
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:04,708
Maybe this isn't
such a good idea.

430
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:10,948
See? It worked.

431
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:14,518
Cory, carrie,
come try this out.

432
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:24,962
I'm telling you,
the week's gonna fly by.

433
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:28,566
Mom's gonna win over her dad
and we'll all be rich.

434
00:24:28,568 --> 00:24:31,635
We'll never have to
see this attic again.

435
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:36,774
This is cold and greasy!
I don't like it.

436
00:24:36,776 --> 00:24:38,709
Cripes, carrie.
This is all we have.

437
00:24:38,711 --> 00:24:40,044
No!

438
00:24:40,046 --> 00:24:41,111
I don't
like this either.

439
00:24:41,113 --> 00:24:43,547
Children, enough.

440
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:48,519
Wasting food...

441
00:24:48,521 --> 00:24:50,821
Is the devil's work.

442
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:56,861
If you leave so much
as one bite of your food...

443
00:24:56,863 --> 00:24:58,529
God will tell me--

444
00:24:58,531 --> 00:24:59,563
[giggling]

445
00:24:59,565 --> 00:25:00,931
...And you will be punished

446
00:25:00,933 --> 00:25:03,901
And sent
to the bowels of hell!

447
00:25:03,903 --> 00:25:05,603
[laughing]

448
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:09,540
Mommy!

449
00:25:09,542 --> 00:25:10,541
Oh, mom. Sorry.

450
00:25:10,543 --> 00:25:11,976
We were just
goofing around.

451
00:25:11,978 --> 00:25:14,178
[cathy]: He was trying
to get the twins to eat.

452
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,946
Oh, kids, what did I tell you?

453
00:25:15,948 --> 00:25:17,848
I just, um...

454
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,617
Oh, mother. Um...

455
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:22,887
Don't be mad.
It's not their fault.

456
00:25:22,889 --> 00:25:25,055
They didn't
properly understand.

457
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:28,759
They will.

458
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:46,043
[door creaking]

459
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:52,650
Mom?

460
00:25:52,652 --> 00:25:53,884
You okay?

461
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:56,654
I just wanted to come
say goodnight.

462
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:01,859
How was your first day?
It wasn't so bad, was it?

463
00:26:01,861 --> 00:26:04,728
Mommy, we don't
like it here.

464
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,030
It's not nice.

465
00:26:06,032 --> 00:26:07,164
Carrie, stop.

466
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:10,167
No. Cathy and christopher
are mean.

467
00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:11,869
We wanna go home.

468
00:26:11,871 --> 00:26:12,903
[cory]:
With you, mama.

469
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:13,938
We want you.

470
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,940
I'm sorry, darlings,

471
00:26:15,942 --> 00:26:18,709
It's just, for now,

472
00:26:18,711 --> 00:26:20,778
You have to listen to
your older brother and sister,

473
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,979
Like they're parents.

474
00:26:21,981 --> 00:26:23,013
No!

475
00:26:23,015 --> 00:26:25,983
Take us out of here. Now!

476
00:26:25,985 --> 00:26:27,785
Corrine!

477
00:26:27,787 --> 00:26:30,721
Stop that child from screaming
right now.

478
00:26:30,723 --> 00:26:32,089
[shrieks]

479
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:35,025
Ow! Get away from me!

480
00:26:35,027 --> 00:26:37,027
Get! Get off!

481
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:39,029
Stop yelling!
They're only five.

482
00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:40,631
Take off your blouse
and show them

483
00:26:40,633 --> 00:26:42,733
How bad behavior is
dealt with in this house.

484
00:26:42,735 --> 00:26:44,702
You can do whatever
you want to me,

485
00:26:44,704 --> 00:26:46,136
But you can't be
cruel to my children,

486
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:47,805
Or we'll leave tonight,

487
00:26:47,807 --> 00:26:49,873
And you'll never see them,
or me, ever again.

488
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:51,809
[chuckles dryly]

489
00:26:51,811 --> 00:26:53,844
Go!

490
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,751
[grandmother resumes chuckling]

491
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:05,889
Now take off
your blouse.

492
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:08,993
[roars]: Do it!

493
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:15,799
Take a good long look, children,

494
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:19,203
At what happens
when you disobey me.

495
00:27:19,205 --> 00:27:21,138
18 lashes,

496
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:24,074
For every year she used
her wicked charms

497
00:27:24,076 --> 00:27:25,809
On my husband!

498
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:28,212
And 20 more

499
00:27:28,214 --> 00:27:31,815
For every year she lived in sin
with your father.

500
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:33,817
A marriage
that was an abomination

501
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:35,919
In the eyes of the lord,

502
00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:37,955
With four children

503
00:27:37,957 --> 00:27:39,723
Spawned by the devil!

504
00:27:39,725 --> 00:27:41,892
Evil...

505
00:27:41,894 --> 00:27:44,995
From the moment
you were conceived.

506
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:46,964
Evil!

507
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:53,070
I make the rules
in this house.

508
00:27:53,072 --> 00:27:55,939
I do!

509
00:27:55,941 --> 00:27:59,076
And I execute the punishment.

510
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:16,326
[door creaks]

511
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:22,433
Figured since I couldn't
get you a real garden,

512
00:28:22,435 --> 00:28:24,735
That you could build
a garden in the attic.

513
00:28:24,737 --> 00:28:25,769
What about
grandmother?

514
00:28:25,771 --> 00:28:27,271
Won't she punish us?

515
00:28:27,273 --> 00:28:29,707
She's claustrophobic.

516
00:28:29,709 --> 00:28:32,009
She'll never
climb the stairs.

517
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:36,046
[exhales sharply]

518
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:37,381
You should take it easy. Mom.

519
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:38,716
It's okay.

520
00:28:38,718 --> 00:28:40,250
It's just
a willow switching.

521
00:28:40,252 --> 00:28:43,053
My pride hurts
worse than my back.

522
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:45,489
But why?

523
00:28:45,491 --> 00:28:48,192
Why did grandmother say
those things about daddy?

524
00:28:48,194 --> 00:28:49,827
About us?

525
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:53,197
When I was little,

526
00:28:53,199 --> 00:28:55,432
I turned to
my father for love.

527
00:28:55,434 --> 00:28:57,167
We did everything
together.

528
00:28:57,169 --> 00:28:59,436
Sailing
and horseback-riding,

529
00:28:59,438 --> 00:29:01,438
Even hunting.

530
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,275
That only made my mother
more jealous.

531
00:29:05,277 --> 00:29:07,311
And she took every
opportunity she could

532
00:29:07,313 --> 00:29:09,213
To torment me
and shame me,

533
00:29:09,215 --> 00:29:10,748
And she succeeded.

534
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,149
Over the years,

535
00:29:12,151 --> 00:29:13,317
My father became more
and more busy with work,

536
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:15,285
And I became

537
00:29:15,287 --> 00:29:17,387
More withdrawn
and lonely.

538
00:29:17,389 --> 00:29:22,126
And into all this came
my father's half-brother.

539
00:29:22,128 --> 00:29:25,362
His mother had recently died
and my family took him in.

540
00:29:25,364 --> 00:29:28,232
He was only
a few years older than me.

541
00:29:28,234 --> 00:29:33,070
He was so handsome
and so kind, and, uh...

542
00:29:33,072 --> 00:29:34,404
So full of life.

543
00:29:34,406 --> 00:29:35,906
[sad chuckle]

544
00:29:35,908 --> 00:29:38,542
My father treated him
like he was his own son,

545
00:29:38,544 --> 00:29:40,544
And I'd never met
anyone like him.

546
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:45,115
[sighs]

547
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:48,218
You're talking about dad?

548
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:54,391
We tried to keep
our feelings secret,

549
00:29:54,393 --> 00:29:56,460
Even from each other.

550
00:29:56,462 --> 00:29:58,495
I mean, we were
related by blood.

551
00:29:58,497 --> 00:29:59,563
He was my half-uncle.

552
00:29:59,565 --> 00:30:01,398
And when we eloped,

553
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,535
My family flew into a rage
and my father disinherited me,

554
00:30:04,537 --> 00:30:06,136
And my mother said

555
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:08,172
That my children would be
born with hooved feet

556
00:30:08,174 --> 00:30:10,174
And forked tails.

557
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:12,342
She was wrong.

558
00:30:12,344 --> 00:30:14,378
God didn't punish me,
not with you.

559
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,413
You are perfect.

560
00:30:16,415 --> 00:30:19,116
You have to believe it,
no matter what anyone says.

561
00:30:19,118 --> 00:30:20,551
I hope you can understand

562
00:30:20,553 --> 00:30:24,555
That love doesn't always come
when you want it.

563
00:30:24,557 --> 00:30:28,525
Sometimes it just happens,
against your will.

564
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:33,363
I don't care what you did, mom,
or do.

565
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:36,433
I'll always love you.

566
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:43,040
Why did grandmother
let you come back?

567
00:30:43,042 --> 00:30:44,374
Because she's been
waiting 20 years

568
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:46,310
To say
"I told you so."

569
00:30:46,312 --> 00:30:48,345
Trust me, cathy,

570
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:51,448
I'm as much a captive
of this place as you are.

571
00:30:58,957 --> 00:31:00,390
Hey, cor'.

572
00:31:00,392 --> 00:31:01,925
That's a great...

573
00:31:01,927 --> 00:31:03,427
It's a snail.

574
00:31:03,429 --> 00:31:05,863
I can't wait to show it
to mama when she comes.

575
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:09,199
If she comes.

576
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:10,601
She's only missed
a few days.

577
00:31:10,603 --> 00:31:11,568
A week.

578
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:13,437
I've made a calendar.

579
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:28,485
You gonna help out
with the garden or what?

580
00:31:28,487 --> 00:31:31,255
We need water.

581
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:39,630
Watch where you're going!

582
00:31:39,632 --> 00:31:42,065
Why are you
in such a hurry?

583
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:44,501
Sorry, I-I just had to
get some more water

584
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:46,670
For christopher
before the paint dries.

585
00:31:46,672 --> 00:31:47,971
The paint?

586
00:31:47,973 --> 00:31:49,506
We're building
a garden,

587
00:31:49,508 --> 00:31:50,607
In the attic,

588
00:31:50,609 --> 00:31:52,643
So the twins
won't be so scared.

589
00:31:52,645 --> 00:31:54,444
Was this
your mother's idea?

590
00:31:55,613 --> 00:31:58,916
Hope you didn't inherit
her artistic abilities.

591
00:31:58,918 --> 00:32:03,320
The only real talent
corrine ever had was...

592
00:32:03,322 --> 00:32:06,023
For the opposite sex.

593
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:10,494
I'm a dancer, actually.
Ballet.

594
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:12,496
And christopher's
a really good artist.

595
00:32:12,498 --> 00:32:13,697
He can paint anything.

596
00:32:13,699 --> 00:32:15,933
Has he ever
painted you?

597
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:19,403
Has he asked you
to pose for him

598
00:32:19,405 --> 00:32:21,071
With your clothes off?

599
00:32:21,073 --> 00:32:23,006
Come on, girl!

600
00:32:23,008 --> 00:32:24,541
Spill out the truth!

601
00:32:24,543 --> 00:32:26,677
I want to know what kind of
wickedness you're up to!

602
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:28,645
Nothing.

603
00:32:28,647 --> 00:32:30,414
Nothing?

604
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:32,115
Why are you trembling?

605
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:35,052
Because you keep accusing us
of doing all these bad things,

606
00:32:35,054 --> 00:32:37,487
And I don't even know
what you're talking about.

607
00:32:37,489 --> 00:32:39,122
[scoffs bitterly]

608
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:41,024
You don't know
what I'm talking about.

609
00:32:41,026 --> 00:32:43,560
Ask your brother!

610
00:32:43,562 --> 00:32:46,596
He'll know.

611
00:32:46,598 --> 00:32:47,698
By the time they're born,

612
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,033
The male of the species

613
00:32:50,035 --> 00:32:53,503
They know all about
wickedness...

614
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:56,974
Evil.

615
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:05,649
Right. Now, make sure
that you take all of your toys.

616
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:07,684
Check under the beds.
Make sure.

617
00:33:07,686 --> 00:33:09,586
I don't want
any trace of you here.

618
00:33:09,588 --> 00:33:12,022
Why don't you take this?

619
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,727
Why does this table
look polished?

620
00:33:16,729 --> 00:33:21,365
The room can't look
like it's just been dusted!

621
00:33:21,367 --> 00:33:24,001
The maids are gonna be here
in less than an hour.

622
00:33:24,003 --> 00:33:26,737
Alright, never mind.
I'll take care of it.

623
00:33:26,739 --> 00:33:28,538
Uh--

624
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:34,678
Here are some real flowers
for your fake garden.

625
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:39,549
Just go.

626
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:54,498
"see jane run.

627
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:57,367
Run, jane, run."

628
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:59,036
Now you try.

629
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:00,470
No!

630
00:34:00,472 --> 00:34:03,473
We've already read it
a kazillion times.

631
00:34:03,475 --> 00:34:05,742
[cathy]: If you guys
play nicely tonight,

632
00:34:05,744 --> 00:34:07,811
We can go on the roof
tomorrow morning.

633
00:34:07,813 --> 00:34:09,413
[cory]:
I don't wanna go on the roof.

634
00:34:09,415 --> 00:34:10,781
Mom!

635
00:34:10,783 --> 00:34:13,650
We missed you so much!

636
00:34:13,652 --> 00:34:16,420
I'm sorry I've kept you
waiting so long, darlings,

637
00:34:16,422 --> 00:34:18,221
But here's some games,

638
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:20,057
And the paints
you asked for, cathy.

639
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:21,491
Where have you been?

640
00:34:21,493 --> 00:34:24,428
I wanted
to come earlier, but...

641
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:26,763
I've had to spend every moment
with my father.

642
00:34:26,765 --> 00:34:29,099
You have no idea
how hard it's been on me.

643
00:34:29,101 --> 00:34:30,534
Today, I finally

644
00:34:30,536 --> 00:34:31,802
Just had a chance
to go sailing on the lake.

645
00:34:31,804 --> 00:34:33,503
You went sailing?

646
00:34:33,505 --> 00:34:35,472
You got some great
color, mom.

647
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:38,508
Can you stay for
the twins' bedtime?

648
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,677
[twins cheering]:
Yeah! Stay! Stay!

649
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:43,547
I have a movie date
with an old friend.

650
00:34:43,549 --> 00:34:44,648
She keeps
asking me out

651
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:47,684
But I would much rather
be with you guys!

652
00:34:47,686 --> 00:34:50,754
Then why aren't you downstairs
telling your father about us?

653
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:52,689
Well, cathy, I have to time it
very carefully.

654
00:34:52,691 --> 00:34:53,723
I only just got back.

655
00:34:53,725 --> 00:34:55,158
It's been a month!

656
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:58,462
And I'm sick of
being in here.

657
00:34:58,464 --> 00:35:00,831
The twins need
fresh air and sunshine.

658
00:35:00,833 --> 00:35:03,233
I want to go sailing!

659
00:35:03,235 --> 00:35:04,701
Stop picking
on mom, cathy.

660
00:35:04,703 --> 00:35:06,503
I just want to know when.

661
00:35:06,505 --> 00:35:08,605
When are you going to tell
your father about us?

662
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:10,440
When do we get to leave?

663
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:11,708
Like I said,

664
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,577
My father has just
finally accepted me back.

665
00:35:13,579 --> 00:35:16,146
Then why can't he accept us?

666
00:35:16,148 --> 00:35:20,317
Are we so terrible,
or stupid, or ugly,

667
00:35:20,319 --> 00:35:23,520
That he wouldn't want to meet
his own grandchildren?

668
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:27,657
I can't.

669
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:32,229
I can't tell him
about you, ever.

670
00:35:32,231 --> 00:35:34,598
My father forgave me
on one condition--

671
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,801
That I didn't have any children
with your father.

672
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:44,608
You know what?

673
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:45,842
I'll cancel
my movie date,

674
00:35:45,844 --> 00:35:48,145
And I'll stay here
with you and the twins.

675
00:35:48,147 --> 00:35:50,147
It's okay, mom.

676
00:35:51,215 --> 00:35:53,150
You go.

677
00:35:53,152 --> 00:35:56,653
We'll be fine here.

678
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:15,238
He could go
any day now.

679
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,707
That's how
heart disease works.

680
00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:19,676
A blood clot
could break free

681
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:21,945
And find its way
to his lungs or heart,

682
00:36:21,947 --> 00:36:23,914
Snuff him out
like a candle.

683
00:36:23,916 --> 00:36:26,583
With our luck,
grandfather will never die.

684
00:36:26,585 --> 00:36:28,251
We'll be stuck
up here forever.

685
00:36:28,253 --> 00:36:30,820
What's few more weeks?
A month, even?

686
00:36:30,822 --> 00:36:32,255
Pretty soon,

687
00:36:32,257 --> 00:36:33,523
We're gonna be
worth millions.

688
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:35,525
Mom already acts
like she is.

689
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:36,793
Have you noticed

690
00:36:36,795 --> 00:36:37,928
How she's always
in a new outfit?

691
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:39,396
She's a foxworth.

692
00:36:39,398 --> 00:36:41,298
She has to fit in
around here.

693
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,899
Cory's a cheater!

694
00:36:42,901 --> 00:36:45,802
I thought you guys were
playing hide-and-seek.

695
00:36:45,804 --> 00:36:47,370
We were!

696
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:48,471
But I called and called
and he won't come out.

697
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:54,211
Cory!

698
00:36:54,213 --> 00:36:55,946
Where are you?

699
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:01,952
Christopher.

700
00:37:01,954 --> 00:37:03,687
Over here.

701
00:37:03,689 --> 00:37:05,889
[d]

702
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:08,692
[thud]

703
00:37:08,694 --> 00:37:10,994
[d]

704
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:17,767
[d]

705
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:22,572
It's gonna be okay.

706
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:24,474
We just need to get him
warmed up.

707
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:35,518
[d]

708
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,928
Cathy?

709
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:48,331
I miss mama so much.

710
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:50,734
Pretend I'm your mom.

711
00:37:50,736 --> 00:37:53,870
I love you so much.

712
00:37:53,872 --> 00:37:55,805
That's what makes
a real mother.

713
00:37:57,008 --> 00:37:57,974
[footsteps]

714
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:04,681
[d]

715
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:24,701
[d]

716
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:44,754
Our first christmas
without dad.

717
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:50,493
Remember how
he used to take us sledding

718
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:52,562
Behind the flanagans'?

719
00:38:52,564 --> 00:38:55,565
He was always
running alongside us,

720
00:38:55,567 --> 00:38:58,735
Making sure
the twins were safe.

721
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:04,407
One christmas
up here won't matter.

722
00:39:04,409 --> 00:39:07,010
And we can make our own
presents for the twins.

723
00:39:07,012 --> 00:39:08,511
Say it's from santa.

724
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:11,014
We could make something
for grandmother, too.

725
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:13,350
She does bring us
food every day.

726
00:39:13,352 --> 00:39:15,385
She got us that plant.

727
00:39:15,387 --> 00:39:18,955
She might even let us out.

728
00:39:18,957 --> 00:39:21,358
[d]

729
00:39:22,993 --> 00:39:24,361
Hurry, cathy!

730
00:39:24,363 --> 00:39:25,395
She's gonna
be here.

731
00:39:25,397 --> 00:39:27,464
Careful.
I don't want it to rip.

732
00:39:27,466 --> 00:39:28,865
Christopher,
can I have the card?

733
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:31,101
It has to be perfect.

734
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:34,771
[d]

735
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:41,511
Grandmother?

736
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:45,782
[d]

737
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:08,638
[card rustling]

738
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:18,948
Cathy! Cathy!
Wake up. Santa came!

739
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:24,487
This gift
is not from santa.

740
00:40:24,489 --> 00:40:26,890
It's for cory and carrie
to play pretend house,

741
00:40:26,892 --> 00:40:28,191
Just like I did.

742
00:40:28,193 --> 00:40:29,526
And all the doors and windows
really work

743
00:40:29,528 --> 00:40:30,527
And the locks.

744
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:36,499
I knew that color
would look perfect on you.

745
00:40:36,501 --> 00:40:39,202
You look just like your father
when I first met him.

746
00:40:39,204 --> 00:40:40,703
You think so?

747
00:40:40,705 --> 00:40:44,841
[d]

748
00:40:46,677 --> 00:40:48,144
I got this
sent from paris.

749
00:40:48,146 --> 00:40:50,079
It's hand-embroidered.

750
00:40:50,081 --> 00:40:51,581
Don't you like it?

751
00:40:51,583 --> 00:40:53,216
Yes.

752
00:40:53,218 --> 00:40:56,085
I just don't know
where I'd wear it.

753
00:40:57,655 --> 00:40:59,489
Well, I know
it's not a perfect christmas,

754
00:40:59,491 --> 00:41:01,891
But I still have
one more trick up my sleeve.

755
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:07,163
A window
to the outside world.

756
00:41:07,165 --> 00:41:08,932
My father
gave it to me.

757
00:41:08,934 --> 00:41:10,533
But that's not all.

758
00:41:10,535 --> 00:41:12,068
Bart, mr. Winslow,
he says that my father

759
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:14,204
Has an even bigger
surprise for me.

760
00:41:14,206 --> 00:41:15,672
Who's mr. Winslow?

761
00:41:15,674 --> 00:41:17,040
He's my father's attorney.

762
00:41:17,042 --> 00:41:18,208
He says it's only a matter

763
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:20,577
Of drawing up
the new paperwork, but...

764
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:22,579
I'm gonna
inherit everything.

765
00:41:22,581 --> 00:41:24,514
[squeals and laughs]

766
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:28,218
I knew you could do it, mom.

767
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,486
He's throwing me
a party tonight,

768
00:41:29,488 --> 00:41:30,954
With champagne
and a live orchestra

769
00:41:30,956 --> 00:41:32,655
And anyone who's anyone--

770
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:34,090
-...In virginia.
-Can we come?

771
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:36,993
Please?

772
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:39,629
We'll hide somewhere
and we'll be quiet,

773
00:41:39,631 --> 00:41:41,564
And no one will hear us
or see us, I swear.

774
00:41:41,566 --> 00:41:42,799
I think it's too risky.

775
00:41:42,801 --> 00:41:45,768
I mean, after putting
in all this time...

776
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:48,137
We haven't seen
other people in so long.

777
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:52,108
It's the only thing
I really want.

778
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:54,043
Don't you care
if I'm happy?

779
00:41:54,045 --> 00:41:55,111
Cathy, quit it.

780
00:41:55,113 --> 00:41:56,579
You think she's happy

781
00:41:56,581 --> 00:41:57,647
Knowing her kids
are locked up in an attic?

782
00:41:57,649 --> 00:41:58,781
[sighs]

783
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:00,517
It's okay, christopher.

784
00:42:01,585 --> 00:42:02,719
You can come.

785
00:42:02,721 --> 00:42:04,554
You can both come.

786
00:42:04,556 --> 00:42:06,856
After the twins
are asleep.

787
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:09,626
I feel like, for the first time
since your father died,

788
00:42:09,628 --> 00:42:12,729
Things are finally
looking up for us.

789
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:20,837
This is where I used to hide and
watch my parents' parties.

790
00:42:20,839 --> 00:42:22,205
Just remember
your promise, okay?

791
00:42:22,207 --> 00:42:23,273
Be quiet as mice.

792
00:42:23,275 --> 00:42:24,274
And after dinner,

793
00:42:24,276 --> 00:42:26,309
Go straight back
to our room.

794
00:42:26,311 --> 00:42:27,310
Yes.

795
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:39,088
[band plays christmas music

[sighing]

798
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:53,202
The house hasn't been
so lively in years.

799
00:42:53,204 --> 00:42:55,038
And all this
because of you.

800
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,172
That's what worries me.

801
00:42:56,174 --> 00:42:57,740
I hope I don't
disappoint anyone.

802
00:42:57,742 --> 00:43:01,010
Oh, no, miss foxworth,
you're as lovely as ever.

803
00:43:01,012 --> 00:43:03,212
Thank you, sarah.

804
00:43:04,815 --> 00:43:06,649
[background chatter]

805
00:43:06,651 --> 00:43:08,651
That dress...

806
00:43:08,653 --> 00:43:12,188
Most women would be
too modest to wear it.

807
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:14,190
I know you don't
approve of this party,

808
00:43:14,192 --> 00:43:15,224
But try to have fun,

809
00:43:15,226 --> 00:43:16,659
For father's sake.

810
00:43:16,661 --> 00:43:20,163
Your father's well-being
is my only concern.

811
00:43:20,165 --> 00:43:23,366
It's the one thing
we share.

812
00:43:23,368 --> 00:43:24,801
Merry christmas.

813
00:43:24,803 --> 00:43:26,202
Corrine, this is
all too gorgeous.

814
00:43:26,204 --> 00:43:27,236
I wanted
something simpler,

815
00:43:27,238 --> 00:43:28,671
But my father insisted.

816
00:43:28,673 --> 00:43:29,839
[corrine giggles]

817
00:43:29,841 --> 00:43:32,775
Well, I always told him,
"spare the rod,

818
00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:34,143
And spoil the child."

819
00:43:34,145 --> 00:43:35,612
Mother, please.

820
00:43:35,614 --> 00:43:37,714
Well, she certainly
doesn't look spoiled.

821
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:42,819
God, I can't
even imagine

822
00:43:42,821 --> 00:43:44,754
Being invited
to a party like this.

823
00:43:44,756 --> 00:43:45,888
You won't have to.

824
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:47,824
Someday,
it's gonna be our party.

825

[bustling of guests below]

826
00:43:49,861 --> 00:43:51,861
John, I told
sarah specifically

827
00:43:51,863 --> 00:43:54,097
To serve
the aged bourbon.

828
00:43:54,099 --> 00:43:55,698
I always keep

829
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,867
A few extra bottles
handy up here.

830
00:43:57,869 --> 00:43:59,769
I know how
mr. Foxworth enjoys it.

831
00:43:59,771 --> 00:44:00,703
[quiet gasps]

832
00:44:00,705 --> 00:44:02,238
Oh, never mind.

833
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,308
It'll just make him
fall asleep before dinner.

834
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:06,709
And john...

835
00:44:06,711 --> 00:44:08,378
Get rid of sarah.

836
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:09,912
Tonight?

837
00:44:09,914 --> 00:44:12,148
But, ma'am,
it's dead cold out,

838
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:13,716
And there are no more trains.

839
00:44:13,718 --> 00:44:15,418
Well, then
that will show the servants

840
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:19,222
What happens
when they don't do as I say.

Father!

845
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,688
Merry christmas.

848
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:03,766
It's so beautiful.

849
00:45:03,768 --> 00:45:05,401
I don't deserve that.

850
00:45:05,403 --> 00:45:07,470
It belonged to my mother.

851
00:45:07,472 --> 00:45:10,406
Passed on
from her own mother.

852
00:45:10,408 --> 00:45:12,375
And this...

853
00:45:12,377 --> 00:45:14,243
Is just the beginning.

[deflating sigh]

855
00:45:19,783 --> 00:45:21,350
It's so beautiful.

Ah.

[sighs]

858
00:45:31,929 --> 00:45:35,832
Maybe someday you'll have
a daughter of your own

859
00:45:35,834 --> 00:45:38,735
That you can
pass it on to.

You're missing
all the fun, mr. Winslow.

Come on, corrine.

866
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:05,294
Just five minutes alone.

867
00:46:05,296 --> 00:46:06,963
You know
I hate big parties.

868
00:46:06,965 --> 00:46:08,030
I can't, bart.

869
00:46:08,032 --> 00:46:09,499
Everyone's
waiting for me.

870
00:46:09,501 --> 00:46:12,235
You must have a secret.

What?

872
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:15,004
You're beautiful, smart...

873
00:46:15,006 --> 00:46:16,305
Pretty soon,
you'll be one of

874
00:46:16,307 --> 00:46:17,874
The richest women
in virginia.

That's the least
of your charm.

How are you
so perfect?

877
00:46:21,846 --> 00:46:23,379
Well, I'm far from perfect.

878
00:46:23,381 --> 00:46:24,981
Just ask my mother.

879
00:46:24,983 --> 00:46:27,784
Ah, what does
your mother know?

the dutiful daughter, remember?

our lives together...

No. No, not yet.

to see this famous "swan bed"

about my bed.

00:48:10,922 --> 00:48:12,455
Where is
christopher?

902
00:48:12,457 --> 00:48:15,091
I don't know.
He went to look around.

903
00:48:15,093 --> 00:48:17,193
Do you know
what would happen

904
00:48:17,195 --> 00:48:18,594
If anyone found out
about you?

905
00:48:18,596 --> 00:48:21,597
Just when everything
is coming together for me?

906
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:22,665
Mom, we were quiet.

907
00:48:22,667 --> 00:48:25,034
No one heard us,
I swear.

908
00:48:25,036 --> 00:48:26,402
Just for that, you will never
come out of this room.

909
00:48:26,404 --> 00:48:28,104
Not for any reason!

910
00:48:28,106 --> 00:48:29,505
How can you say that?

911
00:48:29,507 --> 00:48:31,574
You can't keep us
locked in here forever.

912
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:37,480
[smack]

913
00:48:37,482 --> 00:48:38,581
If you ever
do that again,

914
00:48:38,583 --> 00:48:40,149
I will whip you!

915
00:48:40,151 --> 00:48:42,118
And cathy, too!

916
00:48:51,194 --> 00:48:53,129
[footsteps]

917
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:55,531
Morning.

918
00:49:02,139 --> 00:49:04,106
What's the matter?

919
00:49:04,108 --> 00:49:07,209
Should I tell santa
to take back all your presents?

920
00:49:07,211 --> 00:49:08,210
Go play.

921
00:49:17,187 --> 00:49:19,188
I'm sorry
about last night.

922
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:21,290
I didn't mean it,
about the whippings.

923
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:22,959
Any of it.

924
00:49:22,961 --> 00:49:25,061
I just-- I was scared
that you would get caught

925
00:49:25,063 --> 00:49:27,096
And we would lose everything.

926
00:49:27,098 --> 00:49:28,264
[sighs]

927
00:49:28,266 --> 00:49:30,232
I would never do anything
to hurt you.

928
00:49:30,234 --> 00:49:32,034
You have to
believe me.

929
00:49:34,071 --> 00:49:35,972
What about bart winslow?

930
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,742
We saw you together.

931
00:49:39,744 --> 00:49:41,744
Are you with him?

932
00:49:41,746 --> 00:49:44,180
Well, I-I told you,
he's my father's attorney,

933
00:49:44,182 --> 00:49:46,215
And he's helping us.

934
00:49:46,217 --> 00:49:48,517
You should be glad
that we've become so close.

935
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:54,190
This is all a mistake.

936
00:49:54,192 --> 00:49:55,524
What?

937
00:49:55,526 --> 00:49:56,659
Coming here.

938
00:49:56,661 --> 00:49:59,028
Look what it's done to you.

939
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:01,263
To me.

940
00:50:01,265 --> 00:50:04,133
Let's leave, right now.

941
00:50:04,135 --> 00:50:06,535
Start over somewhere else,
without my father's money.

942
00:50:06,537 --> 00:50:08,037
No amount of money is worth

943
00:50:08,039 --> 00:50:09,739
Having my own children
not love me.

944
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:16,345
Just know that,
if we leave,

945
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:19,148
We can never
come back.

946
00:50:27,591 --> 00:50:29,625
Of course,
I love you, mom.

947
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:35,331
[d]

948
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:50,746
[d]

949
00:51:08,832 --> 00:51:10,466
<i>[television]:</i>
<i>...A rugged design.</i>

950
00:51:10,468 --> 00:51:12,268
<i>A sturdy,</i>
<i>lightweight steel frame...</i>

951
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:15,304

955
00:51:31,822 --> 00:51:33,656
Hey.
What are you doing up here?

956
00:51:33,658 --> 00:51:35,224
Sorry. I just...

957
00:51:35,226 --> 00:51:38,727
I just realized
we've been here an entire year.

958
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:41,831
What is that?

959
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:44,600
It's nothing.

960
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:47,770
Why do you want to
look at that?

961
00:51:47,772 --> 00:51:49,705
At those women?

962
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:52,274
Just drop it.

963
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:56,312
[she sighs]

964
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:02,718
When men and women
love each other,

965
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,253
They have feelings

966
00:52:04,255 --> 00:52:07,356
In their hearts
as well as their bodies.

967
00:52:07,358 --> 00:52:08,657
See, at your age,
it's natural

968
00:52:08,659 --> 00:52:11,193
That your body
would start changing.

969
00:52:11,195 --> 00:52:13,195
I don't want
my body to change.

970
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:16,265
Well, you don't
have any choice.

971
00:52:16,267 --> 00:52:18,467
It's nature's way of
making you into a woman.

972
00:52:18,469 --> 00:52:21,670
You don't want to be a child
your whole life, do you?

973
00:52:23,173 --> 00:52:25,341
What about
christopher?

974
00:52:25,343 --> 00:52:27,877
Well, he'll have to
start shaving,

975
00:52:27,879 --> 00:52:30,913
And there's other things
that he'll have to learn.

976
00:52:30,915 --> 00:52:32,414
Like what?

977
00:52:32,416 --> 00:52:33,349
Kissing?

978
00:52:34,718 --> 00:52:37,219
You know, I'll explain it all
to you one day.

979
00:52:37,221 --> 00:52:38,821
But in the meantime,

980
00:52:38,823 --> 00:52:40,222
I brought you all
some new clothes.

981
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:43,259
And I brought this
specially for you.

982
00:52:43,261 --> 00:52:45,161
You know, you're lucky.

983
00:52:45,163 --> 00:52:47,897
At your age, I had no one
to come to with these questions.

984
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:52,768
[footsteps receding]

985
00:53:09,319 --> 00:53:10,452
[gasps]

986
00:53:10,454 --> 00:53:12,454
What're you doing?

987
00:53:13,823 --> 00:53:16,392
You look so, uh...

988
00:53:17,494 --> 00:53:18,794
[footsteps]

989
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:25,467
Ah.

990
00:53:25,469 --> 00:53:28,470
I knew I'd catch you
sooner or later.

991
00:53:28,472 --> 00:53:30,206
We weren't
doing anything.

992
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:33,776
You think
you look so pretty

993
00:53:33,778 --> 00:53:36,445
In your new young curves

994
00:53:36,447 --> 00:53:38,414
And your long,
golden hair.

995
00:53:38,416 --> 00:53:40,549
[snaps] how many times
have you allowed your brother

996
00:53:40,551 --> 00:53:42,351
To use you?

997
00:53:42,353 --> 00:53:44,353
Use?

998
00:53:44,355 --> 00:53:45,454
What do you mean?

999
00:53:45,456 --> 00:53:47,223
I walked in
on cathy by accident.

1000
00:53:47,225 --> 00:53:48,824
We haven't done
anything wrong.

1001
00:53:48,826 --> 00:53:51,860
Your sister is almost naked.

1002
00:53:51,862 --> 00:53:53,963
And she allowed you
to look upon her body!

1003
00:53:56,433 --> 00:53:57,499
Sit down, girl.

1004
00:53:57,501 --> 00:53:58,934
What're you doing?

1005
00:53:58,936 --> 00:54:01,003
I am going to cut off
your precious hair

1006
00:54:01,005 --> 00:54:02,838
Down to the scalp.

1007
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,974
Maybe then you won't
feel so much pride

1008
00:54:04,976 --> 00:54:06,375
When you look
in the mirror.

1009
00:54:06,377 --> 00:54:07,910
[gasps]

1010
00:54:07,912 --> 00:54:10,813
You're not gonna cut
one strand of cathy's hair.

1011
00:54:10,815 --> 00:54:13,315
Oh?

1012
00:54:13,317 --> 00:54:15,918
Alright, then.
Have it your way.

1013
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,387
Her hair...

1014
00:54:18,389 --> 00:54:21,457
Or the four of you
don't eat for a week.

1015
00:54:21,459 --> 00:54:23,559
But the twins...
They didn't do anything.

1016
00:54:25,295 --> 00:54:28,497
I think
it'll be your brother

1017
00:54:28,499 --> 00:54:30,532
Who will cut off
your precious hair.

1018
00:54:32,335 --> 00:54:34,937
Or none of you will eat at all.

1019
00:54:45,015 --> 00:54:46,782
I'm still hungry.

1020
00:54:46,784 --> 00:54:48,284
Me too.

1021
00:54:48,286 --> 00:54:50,286
I want
a sandwich now.

1022
00:54:50,288 --> 00:54:51,887
We just need to ration
what we have.

1023
00:54:51,889 --> 00:54:54,623
Until mom comes back.

1024
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:56,492
You guys
can have my crackers.

1025
00:55:15,011 --> 00:55:17,379
How could
she do this to us?

1026
00:55:17,381 --> 00:55:19,515
I don't know.

1027
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:22,851
No!

1028
00:55:22,853 --> 00:55:24,453
We're innocent.

1029
00:55:24,455 --> 00:55:26,522
She can't control us.
We can't let her.

1030
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:33,062
The twins
don't look good.

1031
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:37,499
I can check the mouse
traps in the attic.

1032

[gasps in horror]

1034
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,617
I think it's tar.

1035
00:56:34,157 --> 00:56:36,425
It's not coming out.

1036
00:56:37,794 --> 00:56:39,428
I tried everything

1037
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:41,764
From the chemistry kit
mom gave me.

1038
00:56:41,766 --> 00:56:43,732
You'll have to
use the scissors.

00:57:07,658 --> 00:57:09,725
It wasn't your fault.

1042
00:57:11,528 --> 00:57:14,096
All you did
was look at me.

1043
00:57:14,098 --> 00:57:16,765
I try so hard
not to think about girls.

1044
00:57:22,806 --> 00:57:26,208
I just wish to god
you weren't so...

1045
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:31,447
Close.

1046
00:57:34,584 --> 00:57:37,085
Then you do
think of me?

1047
00:57:38,655 --> 00:57:40,823
You think I'm pretty?

1048
00:57:44,594 --> 00:57:46,595
Yeah. Uh...

1049
00:57:46,597 --> 00:57:49,698
You're pretty, but...

1050
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:52,768
Brothers don't think
of their sisters that way.

No way.

1055
00:58:44,755 --> 00:58:47,189
I need a dance partner
to do this next move.

1056
00:58:47,191 --> 00:58:48,257
I said
I don't dance.

1057
00:58:49,626 --> 00:58:50,926
Gimme that.

You jerk!
This is my favorite one.

1061
00:58:57,935 --> 00:58:59,801
It's not my fault
you outgrew it.

1062
00:58:59,803 --> 00:59:02,938
You're outgrowing
a lot of things.

1063
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:05,207
When are we gonna
outgrow things?

1064
00:59:07,911 --> 00:59:10,913
No! I don't
want to go outside!

1065
00:59:10,915 --> 00:59:12,948
You guys need fresh air
and sunshine.

1066
00:59:12,950 --> 00:59:14,583
It's for
your own good.

1067
00:59:14,585 --> 00:59:15,684
No!

1068
00:59:15,686 --> 00:59:16,919
Let them go, chris.

1069
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:26,261
They're never gonna grow.

1070
00:59:26,263 --> 00:59:28,330
Not in this attic.

1081
01:00:55,885 --> 01:00:57,886
I don't know.

1082
01:00:57,888 --> 01:00:59,755
It's been over a month.

1083
01:00:59,757 --> 01:01:03,025
She's never been
gone that long.

1084
01:01:03,027 --> 01:01:04,259
Why didn't she tell us
where she was going?

1085
01:01:04,261 --> 01:01:05,794
Wherever she is,

1086
01:01:05,796 --> 01:01:08,330
I'm sure
she's thinking of us.

1087
01:01:09,399 --> 01:01:13,001
Do you still trust her?

1088
01:01:14,771 --> 01:01:17,305
[sighs heavily]

1089
01:01:17,307 --> 01:01:19,708
I don't even know
what I feel anymore.

1090
01:01:21,044 --> 01:01:22,778
I mean, I want
to trust her,

1091
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:25,080
I do, but...

1092
01:01:25,082 --> 01:01:27,783
If something
happened to her...

1093
01:01:27,785 --> 01:01:29,885
What would
happen to us?

1094
01:01:31,921 --> 01:01:34,423
[twig snaps]

1095
01:01:40,797 --> 01:01:42,931
She's so beautiful.

1096
01:01:42,933 --> 01:01:44,733
Cathy, careful.

1097
01:01:44,735 --> 01:01:48,003
[cathy chuckles]

1098
01:01:48,005 --> 01:01:49,771
We should get back,

1099
01:01:49,773 --> 01:01:51,873
Before the twins
wake up.

1100
01:01:56,446 --> 01:01:58,080
He's trapped!
Do something!

1101
01:01:58,082 --> 01:02:01,750
Don't let him die!
I want him to be my pet.

1102
01:02:01,752 --> 01:02:02,751
Cory, just
don't touch him.

1103
01:02:02,753 --> 01:02:03,885
You're mean!

1104
01:02:03,887 --> 01:02:05,487
You won't let
cory have anything.

1105
01:02:09,926 --> 01:02:12,894
I'm gonna
call him mickey.

1106
01:02:12,896 --> 01:02:14,730
Careful, be gentle.

1107
01:02:14,732 --> 01:02:17,365
Don't worry.
I'm gonna take good care of you.

1108
01:02:17,367 --> 01:02:18,467
I promise.

1109
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:22,104
-[door opens]
-sweeties!

1110
01:02:22,106 --> 01:02:24,840
I'm sorry
I was gone so long,

1111
01:02:24,842 --> 01:02:26,808
But I have wonderful news!

1112
01:02:26,810 --> 01:02:29,111
Is it grandfather?

1113
01:02:29,113 --> 01:02:30,512
Is he dead?

1114
01:02:30,514 --> 01:02:33,782
Oh, cathy, don't be so morbid.

1115
01:02:33,784 --> 01:02:36,384
Do you remember I told you
about my father's attorney?

1116
01:02:36,386 --> 01:02:38,086
Bart winslow.

1117
01:02:38,088 --> 01:02:40,789
Well, we've grown closer
over the past year,

1118
01:02:40,791 --> 01:02:41,990
And we got married.

1119
01:02:41,992 --> 01:02:43,492
What?

1120
01:02:43,494 --> 01:02:44,493
When did this happen?

1121
01:02:44,495 --> 01:02:45,527
A few months ago.

1122
01:02:45,529 --> 01:02:47,162
That's why
I was gone so long.

1123
01:02:47,164 --> 01:02:49,865
We just got back from
our honeymoon in europe.

1124
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:52,968
Well, I thought about you
the whole time.

1125
01:02:52,970 --> 01:02:54,436
I even got you
these beautiful presents.

1126
01:02:54,438 --> 01:02:57,973
This is a boat
and it's called a gondola.

1127
01:03:01,878 --> 01:03:03,545
You were wrong
to go away.

1128
01:03:03,547 --> 01:03:06,081
To stay away for so long.
I don't care why.

1129
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:08,984
Try to be happy
for me.

1130
01:03:08,986 --> 01:03:11,219
I loved your father,
but he's gone.

1131
01:03:11,221 --> 01:03:12,921
I need
someone to love,

1132
01:03:12,923 --> 01:03:15,056
And someone to love me.

1133
01:03:15,058 --> 01:03:16,558
When you're older,
you'll understand.

1134
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:17,993
We <i>are</i> older, mom!

1135
01:03:17,995 --> 01:03:19,227
Look at us.

1136
01:03:19,229 --> 01:03:20,829
I'm not a kid anymore!

1137
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:23,098
And cathy, does she even
look like a little girl?

1138
01:03:24,167 --> 01:03:25,500
[chuckles dismissively]

1139
01:03:25,502 --> 01:03:27,169
I know
you're gonna love bart.

1140
01:03:27,171 --> 01:03:28,904
I got you
this magnifying glass.

1141
01:03:28,906 --> 01:03:30,205
It's an antique.

1142
01:03:30,207 --> 01:03:32,007
You said we would be up here
for one night,

1143
01:03:32,009 --> 01:03:33,842
Then a few days, a month--

1144
01:03:33,844 --> 01:03:35,477
It's been more than
two years, mom!

1145
01:03:35,479 --> 01:03:37,879
You think your presents
are gonna make up

1146
01:03:37,881 --> 01:03:39,981
For what we've lost?

1147
01:03:39,983 --> 01:03:41,216
What we're losing?

1148
01:03:41,218 --> 01:03:42,517
[shatters]

1149
01:03:44,921 --> 01:03:47,222
You have no right
to talk to me like that.

1150
01:03:47,224 --> 01:03:49,558
You agreed to stay here
until my father died.

1151
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:51,026
I said that I would

1152
01:03:51,028 --> 01:03:52,828
Take care of you,
and I have.

1153
01:03:52,830 --> 01:03:53,929
You have food
and books and toys,

1154
01:03:53,931 --> 01:03:55,530
And a tv set!

1155
01:03:55,532 --> 01:03:58,066
If you can't have pity for us,
think of the twins.

1156
01:03:58,068 --> 01:04:00,068
Mom...

1157
01:04:00,070 --> 01:04:02,237
They don't even know
who you are anymore.

1158
01:04:03,472 --> 01:04:05,207
I'm their mother.

1159
01:04:05,209 --> 01:04:08,210
I'm the only person
who truly loves them.

1160
01:04:08,212 --> 01:04:09,878
[she sighs sullenly]

1161
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:11,880
All along,
I've only done the best I could.

1162
01:04:11,882 --> 01:04:13,548
You haven't even

1163
01:04:13,550 --> 01:04:14,950
Told bart about us.

1164
01:04:14,952 --> 01:04:16,151
Have you?

1165
01:04:20,022 --> 01:04:22,090
He doesn't even know we exist.

1166
01:04:23,259 --> 01:04:26,862
I never could get anything
past you, could I, cathy?

1167
01:04:30,566 --> 01:04:33,268
[key clatters in lock]

1168
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:38,106
[door creaks]

1169
01:04:43,646 --> 01:04:45,213
Are these donuts?

1170
01:04:45,215 --> 01:04:47,983
They're from your mother.

1171
01:04:47,985 --> 01:04:50,285
I wouldn't eat 'em,
if I were you.

1172
01:04:50,287 --> 01:04:52,888
They're not good
for your health.

1173
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:56,191
[door creaks and thuds]

1174
01:05:06,135 --> 01:05:08,637
We could escape,
you know.

1175
01:05:10,273 --> 01:05:12,540
We could go down
the roof again.

1176
01:05:12,542 --> 01:05:14,276
With the twins.

1177
01:05:14,278 --> 01:05:15,577
I know they were
scared before,

1178
01:05:15,579 --> 01:05:18,079
But if we just
explained it...

1179
01:05:18,081 --> 01:05:20,348
And we can time it out
with the train.

1180
01:05:20,350 --> 01:05:21,983
Don't you think
I know that?

1181
01:05:21,985 --> 01:05:23,018
Then why are we
still here?

1182
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:25,120
All the money
in the world

1183
01:05:25,122 --> 01:05:27,088
Is not worth this.

1184

[sighs]

1185
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:35,130
You still believe mom?

1186
01:05:37,366 --> 01:05:39,701
What choice do I have?

1187
01:05:41,637 --> 01:05:43,305
[sighs]

1188
01:05:43,307 --> 01:05:45,240
Besides...

1189
01:05:46,676 --> 01:05:49,577
Where the hell are we supposed
to go from here?

[door creaks]

1194
01:06:05,194 --> 01:06:07,362
Step away
from the window, boy.

1195
01:06:07,364 --> 01:06:10,065
My name's not "boy."

1196
01:06:10,067 --> 01:06:12,334
It's christopher.

1197
01:06:13,736 --> 01:06:15,003
What did you say?

1198
01:06:15,005 --> 01:06:17,005
I said my name is christopher.

1199
01:06:17,007 --> 01:06:19,708
The same as my father's.

1200
01:06:28,351 --> 01:06:30,352
Take off
your shirt, boy.

1201
01:06:32,288 --> 01:06:36,091
I will whip your sister
and both the twins

1202
01:06:36,093 --> 01:06:37,659
If you don't
take off your shirt.

1203
01:06:37,661 --> 01:06:38,760
Now!

1204
01:06:38,762 --> 01:06:41,629
Cathy, go to the attic.

1205
01:06:41,631 --> 01:06:43,231
-Don't touch him!
-Go!

Cathy...

1207
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:47,635
Now.

1208
01:06:47,637 --> 01:06:50,105

I was so scared.

01:07:21,138 --> 01:07:23,138
I kept thinking,

1214
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:25,206
If something
happened to you...

1215
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:28,176
Don't worry, cath'.

1216

I'm right here.

But I don't care.

1221
01:08:22,332 --> 01:08:24,232
Felt good,
didn't it?

1222
01:08:25,501 --> 01:08:27,268
And romantic?

What is the meaning of this?

1226
01:08:32,876 --> 01:08:34,309
Nothing.

1227
01:08:34,311 --> 01:08:37,178
You were right
about us all along.

1228
01:08:38,581 --> 01:08:41,116
We are the devil's spawn.

Can you ever forgive us?

Only the lord can
forgive you, boy.

[chuckling]

1241
01:09:26,395 --> 01:09:27,896
No.

1242
01:09:27,898 --> 01:09:30,165
This is our key.

1243
01:09:44,313 --> 01:09:45,680
This is the master key.

1244
01:09:45,682 --> 01:09:47,382
It should work on all the doors,

1245
01:09:47,384 --> 01:09:48,650
Even the front one.

1246
01:09:48,652 --> 01:09:50,618
I wish we could
run away tonight.

1247
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:53,521
Well, we need money.

1248
01:09:53,523 --> 01:09:54,923
Lots of it.

1249
01:09:54,925 --> 01:09:56,257
So when we escape,

1250
01:09:56,259 --> 01:09:58,593
We can go
wherever we want.

01:10:00,329 --> 01:10:02,297
We can steal...

01:10:02,299 --> 01:10:04,399
From the house.

If grandmother catches us,
she'll whip us.

01:10:25,689 --> 01:10:27,956
You didn't tell me
there was all this stuff.

1260
01:10:29,792 --> 01:10:32,427
Last time I was here,
there wasn't this much stuff.

1261
01:10:32,429 --> 01:10:34,329
How do I look?

1262
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:39,701
You look ridiculous.

1263
01:10:39,703 --> 01:10:41,569
Now, uh...

1264
01:10:41,571 --> 01:10:44,672
Take that stuff off
and start looking for cash.

1265
01:10:48,811 --> 01:10:52,413
We can't take too much
or she might notice.

1266
01:10:56,452 --> 01:10:58,519
Cathy, what's the matter?
Are you deaf?

1267
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:15,503
$30.

1268
01:11:15,505 --> 01:11:18,506
That'll barely get us
to the next county.

1269
01:11:18,508 --> 01:11:20,642
We need a thousand.
A-at least.

1270
01:11:20,644 --> 01:11:21,709
That'll take weeks.

1271
01:11:21,711 --> 01:11:23,344
We need to leave now.

1272
01:11:23,346 --> 01:11:26,547
No, not till we have enough
to get away from here.

1273
01:11:28,317 --> 01:11:29,484
Cory?

1274
01:11:29,486 --> 01:11:30,652
Didn't I give you
my extra donut

1275
01:11:30,654 --> 01:11:32,053
If you'd sit still?

1276
01:11:32,055 --> 01:11:33,521
It's mickey.

1277
01:11:33,523 --> 01:11:35,957
He doesn't like
the hammering noises.

1278
01:11:42,498 --> 01:11:44,666
What are they doing?

1279
01:11:47,036 --> 01:11:50,672
They're putting up a fence.

1280
01:11:50,674 --> 01:11:52,974
[d]

1281
01:11:55,444 --> 01:11:56,811
Alright,
you go in without me.

1282
01:11:56,813 --> 01:11:58,880
I need to check
outside.

1283
01:11:58,882 --> 01:12:00,081
No. What if something
happens to you?

1284
01:12:00,083 --> 01:12:01,716
I have to make sure
we can get out.

1285
01:12:01,718 --> 01:12:03,685
I love you,
christopher doll.

1286
01:12:05,487 --> 01:12:07,088
I love you, too.

1287
01:12:07,090 --> 01:12:09,490
[d]

1288
01:12:22,538 --> 01:12:25,373
[d]

1289
01:13:00,075 --> 01:13:01,142
[zapping]

1290
01:13:02,845 --> 01:13:05,713
[d]

1291
01:13:22,164 --> 01:13:23,664
[corrine]:
Bart, you're just careless.

1292
01:13:23,666 --> 01:13:25,533
You can't find your own wallet.

1293
01:13:25,535 --> 01:13:26,868
[bart]: It's not me,
it's the maids.

1294
01:13:26,870 --> 01:13:28,569
I swear I left it
in my black trousers.

1295
01:13:28,571 --> 01:13:30,171
And I think they've been
stealing from us.

1296
01:13:30,173 --> 01:13:31,439
The other day,
I was missing $5.

1297
01:13:31,441 --> 01:13:32,807
Before that,
it was 10.

1298
01:13:32,809 --> 01:13:34,509
$5, $10--
what's the difference?

1299
01:13:34,511 --> 01:13:35,543
You left me alone
at our own dinner party?

1300
01:13:35,545 --> 01:13:37,478
It's not
exactly a party,

1301
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:38,846
Having to sit across
from your mother.

1302
01:13:38,848 --> 01:13:41,783
I'm sorry. You know
I want to move out of here, too,

1303
01:13:41,785 --> 01:13:43,718
As soon as possible.

1304
01:13:45,154 --> 01:13:47,155
Let's take a trip.

1305
01:13:47,157 --> 01:13:48,523
Babe, I can't.

1306
01:13:48,525 --> 01:13:49,891
You know how busy
work is right now.

1307
01:13:49,893 --> 01:13:51,492
What about
a mini-vacation?

1308
01:13:51,494 --> 01:13:54,495
I know a certain swan bed
that has a vacancy.

1309
01:13:54,497 --> 01:13:56,164
As a matter of fact,

1310
01:13:56,166 --> 01:13:58,466
I had the sweetest dream
earlier there today.

1311
01:13:58,468 --> 01:13:59,634
Really?

1312
01:13:59,636 --> 01:14:01,803
Yeah. A beautiful
young blonde girl

1313
01:14:01,805 --> 01:14:04,772
Snuck into the room,
kissed me.

1314
01:14:04,774 --> 01:14:06,040
Right on the lips.

1315
01:14:06,042 --> 01:14:08,042
She reminded me
of you,

1316
01:14:08,044 --> 01:14:11,446
But younger,
more innocent.

1317
01:14:11,448 --> 01:14:13,514
[d]

1318
01:14:13,516 --> 01:14:15,783
Wow. That must've been a dream.

1319
01:14:15,785 --> 01:14:18,653
Why don't we go stay
in a hotel?

1320
01:14:18,655 --> 01:14:21,656
That way, you don't have to see
my mother's face in the morning.

1321
01:14:21,658 --> 01:14:23,524
[bart chuckles]

1322
01:14:23,526 --> 01:14:25,927
[d]

1323
01:14:31,567 --> 01:14:33,668
How could you be
so careless?

1324
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:35,002
I'm sorry.

1325
01:14:35,004 --> 01:14:36,003
He was asleep.

1326
01:14:36,005 --> 01:14:37,705
I was curious.

1327
01:14:37,707 --> 01:14:39,006
You kissed that man!

1328
01:14:39,008 --> 01:14:40,808
And he wasn't asleep,
he saw you!

1329
01:14:40,810 --> 01:14:42,243
Mom can't know
we passed through a locked door!

1330
01:14:42,245 --> 01:14:43,744
We don't have enough money yet.

1331
01:14:43,746 --> 01:14:45,480
You think you're the only one
frustrated?

1332
01:14:45,482 --> 01:14:47,648
Christopher! Stop!
You're hurting me.

1333
01:14:50,986 --> 01:14:53,688
[breathing hard]

1334
01:15:00,696 --> 01:15:03,764
It's okay.

1335
01:15:03,766 --> 01:15:05,633
You didn't mean it.

1336
01:15:38,767 --> 01:15:40,868
We'll go to florida.

1337
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:43,271
Sarasota...

1338
01:15:43,273 --> 01:15:45,206
Where all
the circus people live.

1339
01:15:46,642 --> 01:15:48,075
Yeah.

1340
01:15:48,077 --> 01:15:50,645
We can star
in a freak show.

1341
01:15:50,647 --> 01:15:53,781
We can pretend
this never happened.

1342
01:15:53,783 --> 01:15:57,018
We can make sure that
it never happens again.

1343
01:16:03,025 --> 01:16:05,593
The thing is...

1344
01:16:05,595 --> 01:16:08,296
I want to feel
this way about you.

1345
01:16:09,598 --> 01:16:10,998
I love you.

1346
01:16:12,634 --> 01:16:15,836
I don't know if I can
ever love anyone else.

1347
01:16:17,339 --> 01:16:19,040
[door opens]

1348
01:16:19,042 --> 01:16:22,310
Cory doesn't feel so good.

1349
01:16:36,191 --> 01:16:38,726
He's been
vomiting for hours.

1350
01:16:38,728 --> 01:16:40,861
I think it might be
food poisoning.

1351
01:16:40,863 --> 01:16:43,864
He needs to go
to the hospital.

1352
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,935
Why are you just
standing there?

1353
01:16:47,937 --> 01:16:50,938
Don't you care
what happens to him?

1354
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:54,742
Have you forgotten
that you're his mother?

1355
01:16:54,744 --> 01:16:56,077
You.

1356
01:16:56,079 --> 01:16:58,713
It's always you.

1357
01:16:58,715 --> 01:17:00,681
[smack]

1358
01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:03,618
[smack]

1359
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:04,752
Cathy, stop!

1360
01:17:04,754 --> 01:17:06,153
You think
you can do anything you want

1361
01:17:06,155 --> 01:17:07,855
And people will believe you.

1362
01:17:07,857 --> 01:17:09,824
They'll learn the truth someday.

1363
01:17:09,826 --> 01:17:12,627
When your husband learns

1364
01:17:12,629 --> 01:17:16,030
You have four children
locked away in an attic,

1365
01:17:16,032 --> 01:17:17,698
See how "perfect"
he thinks you really are.

1366
01:17:17,700 --> 01:17:19,367
And your father, too.

1367
01:17:19,369 --> 01:17:22,103
You won't inherit
one damned penny,

1368
01:17:22,105 --> 01:17:23,804
And I'll be glad!

1369
01:17:24,973 --> 01:17:27,208
The girl is right,
corrine.

1370
01:17:27,210 --> 01:17:29,110
That child should go
to the hospital.

1371
01:17:37,719 --> 01:17:40,054
[d]

1372
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:55,870
[floor creaking]

1373
01:17:55,872 --> 01:17:57,805
[lock turning]

1374
01:18:07,182 --> 01:18:09,784
I drove cory to the hospital.

1375
01:18:09,786 --> 01:18:12,386
How is he?

1376
01:18:13,755 --> 01:18:15,790
Cory had pneumonia.

1377
01:18:15,792 --> 01:18:19,393
The doctors did
all they could, but...

1378
01:18:19,395 --> 01:18:22,363
It was too late.

1379
01:18:29,438 --> 01:18:31,772
Will there be
a funeral?

1380
01:18:31,774 --> 01:18:34,108
He's already been buried.

1381
01:18:35,444 --> 01:18:37,945
[d]

1382
01:18:40,215 --> 01:18:42,416
[starts crying]

1383
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:47,188
[d]

1384
01:18:58,934 --> 01:19:01,001
[carrie bawls]

1385
01:19:01,003 --> 01:19:02,103
I'm sorry.

1386
01:19:02,105 --> 01:19:05,005
[bawling continues]

1387
01:19:12,447 --> 01:19:14,148
[cathy]: Carrie?

1388
01:19:17,519 --> 01:19:19,120
Cathy.

1389
01:19:19,122 --> 01:19:21,188
Just let her be.

1390
01:19:26,161 --> 01:19:28,929
We need to run away.

1391
01:19:28,931 --> 01:19:31,532
Or else we're all
gonna die like cory.

1392
01:19:31,534 --> 01:19:32,833
Do we have
enough money?

1393
01:19:32,835 --> 01:19:34,001
We'll go tonight.

1394
01:19:34,003 --> 01:19:36,103
Take everything we can.
Money, jewelry.

1395
01:19:36,105 --> 01:19:37,505
Everything.

1396
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:41,175
[d]

1397
01:20:01,563 --> 01:20:03,864
[d]

1398
01:20:10,071 --> 01:20:12,306
[voice breaking]:
She's not coming back.

1399
01:20:12,308 --> 01:20:14,575
Is she?

1400
01:20:16,545 --> 01:20:19,046
She's dead to us now.

1401
01:20:25,153 --> 01:20:26,253
When do we tell her?

1402
01:20:26,255 --> 01:20:27,888
After breakfast.

1403
01:20:27,890 --> 01:20:29,290
I don't want her
getting scared.

1404
01:20:29,292 --> 01:20:31,258
More than she has to be.

1405
01:20:33,929 --> 01:20:35,563
So we just walk right
out the front door?

1406
01:20:35,565 --> 01:20:37,097
We wait till dinner,

1407
01:20:37,099 --> 01:20:38,299
When all the servants and family

1408
01:20:38,301 --> 01:20:39,900
Are in the kitchen
or dining room.

1409
01:20:39,902 --> 01:20:40,968
So carrie and I will
go to the fence

1410
01:20:40,970 --> 01:20:42,169
And you'll go to the shed

1411
01:20:42,171 --> 01:20:43,137
So you can turn off
the electricity?

1412
01:20:43,139 --> 01:20:44,538
Then we catch up
by the lake

1413
01:20:44,540 --> 01:20:46,540
And head to the depot
for the evening train.

1414
01:20:46,542 --> 01:20:48,876
And by the time
grandmother comes in

1415
01:20:48,878 --> 01:20:50,044
With our breakfast
tomorrow,

1416
01:20:50,046 --> 01:20:51,979
We'll be halfway
to florida.

1417
01:20:54,416 --> 01:20:57,218
I was thinking,
I can sell my ring.

1418
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:00,855
It's okay.

1419
01:21:00,857 --> 01:21:02,857
It's what
dad would've wanted.

1420
01:21:02,859 --> 01:21:04,091
You're keeping that ring.

1421
01:21:04,093 --> 01:21:06,293
Forever.

1422
01:21:06,295 --> 01:21:08,963
[starts coughing]

1423
01:21:11,299 --> 01:21:14,235
[d]

1424
01:21:32,888 --> 01:21:34,955
[d]

1425
01:21:34,957 --> 01:21:37,892
I'm telling you,
I did hear someone.

1426
01:21:37,894 --> 01:21:39,593
Must be those mice.
They make an awful racket.

1427
01:21:39,595 --> 01:21:41,295
You can hear them
all the way up in the attic.

1428
01:21:41,297 --> 01:21:43,664
Mrs. Foxworth carries
enough poison up there

1429
01:21:43,666 --> 01:21:45,199
To kill
a german army of 'em.

1430
01:21:45,201 --> 01:21:48,035
Do you think miss corrine
will sell the place?

1431
01:21:48,037 --> 01:21:51,071
I doubt she'll be
making any hasty decisions.

1432
01:21:51,073 --> 01:21:52,606
Hasty? It's been
seven months

1433
01:21:52,608 --> 01:21:54,308
Since mr. Foxworth died.

1434
01:21:54,310 --> 01:21:55,943
Well, never mind that.

1435
01:21:55,945 --> 01:21:58,979
All you maids will be
losing your job soon enough

1436
01:21:58,981 --> 01:22:01,215
If you don't
mind the silver.

1437
01:22:04,419 --> 01:22:07,154
[footfalls receding]

1438
01:22:10,191 --> 01:22:12,359
Carrie, you gotta
eat something.

1439
01:22:12,361 --> 01:22:15,062
You have to be strong,
for later.

1440
01:22:15,064 --> 01:22:16,964
No. Don't feel well.

1441
01:22:16,966 --> 01:22:19,333
I have to
take care of mickey.

1442
01:22:20,936 --> 01:22:22,369
Where'd you get that?

1443
01:22:22,371 --> 01:22:24,438
I saved it for cory,

1444
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:27,308
For when he came back
from the hospital.

1445
01:22:29,144 --> 01:22:32,346
[d]

1446
01:22:41,690 --> 01:22:44,191
[d]

1447
01:22:47,128 --> 01:22:49,163
[coughing quietly]

1448
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:54,635
[d]

1449
01:23:06,147 --> 01:23:09,116
Cathy, we need to
leave right now.

1450
01:23:10,151 --> 01:23:12,286
[sniffling]

1451
01:23:12,288 --> 01:23:14,421
It's mickey.

1452
01:23:14,423 --> 01:23:17,424
Carrie gave him
one of cory's donuts

1453
01:23:17,426 --> 01:23:19,493
And he just started
whimpering all of a sudden--

1454
01:23:19,495 --> 01:23:22,463
No. No.
That can't be right.

1455
01:23:22,465 --> 01:23:24,064
What?

1456
01:23:24,066 --> 01:23:26,100
The powdered sugar
on the donuts,

1457
01:23:26,102 --> 01:23:27,701
I think
there was poison in it.

1458
01:23:27,703 --> 01:23:29,136
That's why we're sick.

1459
01:23:29,138 --> 01:23:31,038
Are you saying that
our grandmother

1460
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:32,106
Tried to kill us?

1461
01:23:34,175 --> 01:23:36,377
You have a key.

1462
01:23:36,379 --> 01:23:38,078
[door bangs shut]

1463
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:40,381
Now give it to me.

1464
01:23:43,318 --> 01:23:45,185
No.

1465
01:23:45,187 --> 01:23:47,254
Give it to me
this instant!

1466
01:23:48,323 --> 01:23:50,524
[wracked with coughing]

1467
01:23:50,526 --> 01:23:51,725
Seed of the devil!

1468
01:23:54,796 --> 01:23:57,464
Give me that!

1469
01:23:57,466 --> 01:23:59,433
You're never gonna
leave this room!

1470
01:24:01,269 --> 01:24:03,404
[scoffing]
you're gonna hit me?

1471
01:24:04,472 --> 01:24:06,473
You're gonna whip me?

1472
01:24:06,475 --> 01:24:08,075
Come on!

1473
01:24:08,077 --> 01:24:10,144
Come on. Do it.

1474
01:24:11,212 --> 01:24:13,147
[snickering]

1475
01:24:14,482 --> 01:24:16,817
Beautiful, prideful.

1476
01:24:16,819 --> 01:24:18,085
And weak!

1477
01:24:18,087 --> 01:24:19,219
Just like your mother.

1478
01:24:19,221 --> 01:24:21,088
That's not true.

1479
01:24:21,090 --> 01:24:22,489
You were never
meant to be born.

1480
01:24:22,491 --> 01:24:25,793
You're a stain
on the foxworth name!

1481
01:24:25,795 --> 01:24:28,362
On the name of
the lord himself.

1482
01:24:28,364 --> 01:24:31,131
Now, if you
give me that key,

1483
01:24:31,133 --> 01:24:33,767
I may show you
a little mercy.

1484
01:24:37,272 --> 01:24:38,238
Christopher...

1485
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:39,440
Come on!

1486
01:24:42,243 --> 01:24:44,244
Christopher...

1487
01:24:44,246 --> 01:24:45,779
[gasps] let go!

1488
01:24:45,781 --> 01:24:47,247
Cathy, go to the attic!

1489
01:24:47,249 --> 01:24:48,849
No! Give me that!

1490
01:24:48,851 --> 01:24:53,787
Come back here!
Come back here!

1491
01:24:53,789 --> 01:24:55,789
Carrie, please!

1492
01:24:55,791 --> 01:24:58,525
[carrie gasping]

1493
01:24:58,527 --> 01:25:00,327
Cathy!

1494
01:25:00,329 --> 01:25:02,096
[bangs door shut]

1495
01:25:03,198 --> 01:25:04,832
Why did you do that?

1496
01:25:04,834 --> 01:25:07,668
Don't close the door.

1497
01:25:07,670 --> 01:25:10,871
I need for the door
to be open!

1498
01:25:13,374 --> 01:25:15,242
No. Not the door.

1499
01:25:15,244 --> 01:25:16,543
Don't turn off
the light.

1500
01:25:16,545 --> 01:25:18,512
Open the door!
Turn on the light!

1501
01:25:18,514 --> 01:25:21,615
I need the door
to be open!

1502
01:25:21,617 --> 01:25:23,884
What are you doing?

1503
01:25:23,886 --> 01:25:26,753
No! No! Open the door!

1504
01:25:27,822 --> 01:25:29,590
[weeping] no!

1505
01:25:29,592 --> 01:25:31,859
What are you doing?

1506
01:25:33,161 --> 01:25:34,862
Like you said,

1507
01:25:34,864 --> 01:25:37,231
God sees everything.

1508
01:25:37,233 --> 01:25:39,466
He'll punish you
for what you did to us.

1509
01:25:39,468 --> 01:25:42,436
To cory.

1510
01:25:42,438 --> 01:25:44,872
It wasn't me!

1511
01:25:44,874 --> 01:25:48,842
It was your mother
who poisoned you, not me!

1512
01:25:51,312 --> 01:25:53,447
It doesn't
matter anymore.

1513
01:25:53,449 --> 01:25:55,215
[grandmother sobbing]

1514
01:25:55,217 --> 01:25:56,884
Where are you going?

1515
01:25:56,886 --> 01:25:59,319
Don't go!

1516
01:25:59,321 --> 01:26:00,621
Don't leave me!

1517
01:26:00,623 --> 01:26:03,857
Help! Help!

1518
01:26:03,859 --> 01:26:05,626
Help!

1521
01:26:19,274 --> 01:26:21,875
Cathy, we have to go.

1522
01:26:21,877 --> 01:26:23,443
Be right there.

Are you okay?

Come on.

1530
01:27:04,953 --> 01:27:07,554
I'll cut the electricity
and meet you at the lake.

1531

No! No!

1532
01:27:08,657 --> 01:27:10,691
We're not
going without you.

1533
01:27:10,693 --> 01:27:13,527
Hurry!
We have to make this train.

1534

Stop!

Stop, if you know
what's good for you!

Go.

Before I'm sent
after you!

1541
01:27:36,785 --> 01:27:38,285
I'll cut the power
on the fence.

1542
01:27:38,287 --> 01:27:39,419
Go!

We never have to see
