1
00:00:10,513 --> 00:00:13,263
(engine revving)

2
00:00:15,292 --> 00:00:20,292
(pop music)
(laughing)

3
00:00:20,327 --> 00:00:22,577
(whooping)

4
00:00:25,151 --> 00:00:26,736
- When can I get behind the wheel?

5
00:00:26,736 --> 00:00:27,660
- Oh, you wanna take it?

6
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:28,493
Take it now!

7
00:00:28,493 --> 00:00:29,326
(screaming)

8
00:00:29,326 --> 00:00:30,409
- Oh, my God!

9
00:00:31,913 --> 00:00:33,843
(whooping)

10
00:00:33,843 --> 00:00:35,676
- Hey, over the ridge!

11
00:00:37,232 --> 00:00:39,492
(bumping)

12
00:00:39,492 --> 00:00:42,409
(tires screeching)

13
00:00:44,865 --> 00:00:45,760
(rocks tumbling)

14
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,092
I'd like to see the slow-mo on that one!

15
00:00:48,092 --> 00:00:49,180
Hey man, I'm gonna go take a piss.

16
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,378
I'll be right back.

17
00:00:50,378 --> 00:00:51,390
- [Girl] Be careful.

18
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,223
- Alright.

19
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,073
- Finally!

20
00:01:00,607 --> 00:01:01,581
You animal!

21
00:01:01,581 --> 00:01:03,664
(laughs)

22
00:01:05,383 --> 00:01:08,050
(ominous music)

23
00:01:11,998 --> 00:01:14,248
(belching)

24
00:01:18,734 --> 00:01:20,829
(sprinkling)

25
00:01:20,829 --> 00:01:22,555
(roaring)
(crunching)

26
00:01:22,555 --> 00:01:24,261
(screaming)

27
00:01:24,261 --> 00:01:25,994
(thudding)

28
00:01:25,994 --> 00:01:28,113
(roaring)

29
00:01:28,113 --> 00:01:30,446
(screaming)

30
00:01:36,165 --> 00:01:38,415
(slurping)

31
00:01:47,623 --> 00:01:49,790
(roaring)

32
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:54,962
(eerie orchestra music)

33
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:42,287
- Yeah.

34
00:03:43,378 --> 00:03:46,420
I'm telling you, ma'am, I sent
the check in three weeks ago.

35
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,840
- Well, you may have sent it,
but we haven't received it.

36
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,580
- Okay, give me a couple of days

37
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,560
and I will send you another check.

38
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,180
- That's fine, but if we
don't have your payment

39
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,790
by noon tomorrow we'll have
to shut off your power.

40
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:56,710
- What?

41
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,630
I'm the damn sheriff in this town!

42
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,750
- Look, there is no reason
to raise your voice.

43
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,290
- I've got three homicides on my hands!

44
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:05,923
- That's fine, Sheriff,
you have a nice day.

45
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:08,700
Hello, DWP.

46
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,687
How can I help you?

47
00:04:12,165 --> 00:04:13,582
- Son of a bitch!

48
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,314
- Why don't you guys go ahead
and put the body in the wagon?

49
00:04:21,314 --> 00:04:22,457
- Okay, no problem, right now.

50
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,953
- You don't look much like a happy camper.

51
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,390
- So tell me what you got, Ben.

52
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,310
ID'd them yet?

53
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:43,350
- Judging from the decals on the vehicle

54
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,557
I'd say students from Plains College.

55
00:04:45,557 --> 00:04:46,390
- Uh-huh.

56
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:49,800
Lot of blood.

57
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,633
- Yeah.

58
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,880
- How old were these kids?

59
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,830
- Not more than 20.

60
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,160
- This blood isn't more
than four or five hours old.

61
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,040
So whatever happened here
happened around dawn.

62
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,710
- Yeah, definitely wasn't
a traffic accident, was it?

63
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:12,543
- Uh-uh.

64
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,113
Hold it up.

65
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:21,893
Oh, boy.

66
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,090
Closest thing I ever saw to this

67
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:28,280
was a hiker attacked by a grizzly.

68
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,160
- Or a shark.

69
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,060
We've got neither of them around here.

70
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,430
- Oh, hi, Barbara.

71
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,850
We figured you'd be showing up.

72
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,106
- Your daughter thought it was

73
00:05:44,106 --> 00:05:44,939
important enough to call me in.

74
00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:46,560
I guess you forgot, huh?

75
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,930
- Mm-hmm.

76
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,430
- You two know each other?

77
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,820
- Barbara Phillips.

78
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,720
You wanna show me the bodies?

79
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,553
- Glad to.

80
00:05:59,461 --> 00:06:00,294
- Oh, man.

81
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,491
- Jesus, this is bad.

82
00:06:04,491 --> 00:06:07,190
- [Ben] We pretty much
ruled out a grizzly bear.

83
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,483
- No bear did this.

84
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,210
- What about a cougar?

85
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,043
- I don't know.

86
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:30,860
January 22nd, just off
Route 91 at the basin wash.

87
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,530
We have a footprint.

88
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:33,670
From the looks of it I'd say it's

89
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:37,540
an animal somewhere
between 150 to 200 pounds.

90
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,440
There's part of another one over here.

91
00:06:43,806 --> 00:06:46,660
But it looks to me, whatever it was,

92
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,730
attacked from a two feet,
not a four-footed stance.

93
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:52,155
- But you can't tell what it was?

94
00:06:52,155 --> 00:06:53,205
- It wasn't a cougar.

95
00:06:54,533 --> 00:06:56,382
(roaring)

96
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:58,084
- What the hell was that?

97
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,834
(dramatic music)

98
00:07:04,101 --> 00:07:05,420
Could have been the wind, maybe.

99
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,640
High desert gets pretty quirky sometimes,

100
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,076
even in broad daylight.

101
00:07:09,076 --> 00:07:10,210
- If that was the wind...

102
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,410
- We'll know more after Dr. Johnson

103
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:14,040
does the autopsy on these poor kids.

104
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,873
Let's go.

105
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,340
- I'm waiting.

106
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,100
I am waiting for an explanation.

107
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,030
- Sir, it was all quiet when
I did my 15:30 security check.

108
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:25,580
- 20 minutes to discover the breakout.

109
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,920
Who was watching the monitors?

110
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,750
- Lyle was supposed to be doing
that while I was on patrol.

111
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,640
- Lyle?

112
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,380
- Sir, you told me to
make the neurotransmitter

113
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,741
a top priority so I was
very busy with that.

114
00:07:34,741 --> 00:07:36,430
- Lyle, it's a very simple question.

115
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:40,373
Were you or were you not
watching the monitors?

116
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:43,163
- No, sir.

117
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,730
- Karen, you know that premature hatching

118
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,870
is always a distinct possibility.

119
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,370
Therefore, is it too much to ask that

120
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:51,510
you might oversee the
monitoring of these eggs?

121
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,390
After all, it is your job.

122
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,380
- Yes, sir.

123
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,480
- I'm counting on you.

124
00:07:56,328 --> 00:07:57,730
I'm counting on all of you.

125
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:00,100
- Sir, I can't be in
three places at one time.

126
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,300
- Well, you better be, goddamn it!

127
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,993
The buck stops here!

128
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:05,030
And here!

129
00:08:08,466 --> 00:08:09,299
And here.

130
00:08:09,299 --> 00:08:10,870
- The breach has been repaired, sir.

131
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,250
This will never happen again.

132
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,340
- Marvelous, in the meantime,

133
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,050
we have a hatchling on the loose.

134
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:17,718
You'd better figure out
what you're gonna do, McCoy.

135
00:08:17,718 --> 00:08:19,420
- Dr. Hyde, it's life
expectancy could be as little

136
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,720
as three to five days
without the laser treatment.

137
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,553
- Let's hope so.

138
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,350
I don't want a police investigation.

139
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:27,820
- What about the rest of
the embryo chicks, sir?

140
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:28,710
- They're out of here tonight.

141
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:31,800
Karen, would you please handle this?

142
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,440
- We'll ship them out
to the Utah facility,

143
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,940
use some local farming truck company

144
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,011
so we don't attract any attention.

145
00:08:37,011 --> 00:08:38,344
- Ah, brilliant!

146
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,610
McCoy, hatchlings on the loose.

147
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:45,153
Lyle, do something!

148
00:08:53,071 --> 00:08:55,321
(clucking)

149
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:59,240
- [Man With Cap] How about
giving us a hand with this load?

150
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,390
- Driver, not a loader.

151
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,815
Alright now, ladies.

152
00:09:12,815 --> 00:09:15,815
Buckle up, we got a long road ahead.

153
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,776
- [Tony] McCoy signed off on it

154
00:09:21,776 --> 00:09:23,430
and the security guard's
telling everyone it's okay.

155
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:26,180
- Send Swanson to the
infirmary and tell him

156
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,110
to keep his goddamn mouth shut!

157
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,850
And that goes for you and the others, too,

158
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:31,976
or I'll personally guarantee you'll be

159
00:09:31,976 --> 00:09:33,726
back plucking chickens in Arkansas!

160
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,960
- Hey Merle, how are you?

161
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,260
- Hey, Tony.

162
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,300
- Sorry to say, no one in or out.

163
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,900
- Oh, I gotta get these cluckers over

164
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,933
to Fort Rogers and I'm three hours late.

165
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,690
- Alright, we'll say you left already.

166
00:09:58,951 --> 00:10:01,618
(ominous music)

167
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:14,953
(clucking)

168
00:10:14,953 --> 00:10:17,698
(country music)

169
00:10:17,698 --> 00:10:22,115
(roaring)
(crashing)

170
00:10:33,772 --> 00:10:36,439
(ominous music)

171
00:10:44,873 --> 00:10:45,860
- Holy criminy!

172
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,203
How'd you all get loose?

173
00:10:54,515 --> 00:10:56,827
What the hell's going on back here?

174
00:10:56,827 --> 00:10:57,660
Jesus!

175
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,713
(roaring)

176
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:15,046
(screaming)

177
00:11:18,749 --> 00:11:23,332
(crunching)
(growling)

178
00:11:26,534 --> 00:11:29,034
(tense music)

179
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,450
- Sheriff, it's Baltin.

180
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:10,430
I'm on Route 49 about three
miles south of the overpass.

181
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,850
I've got an abandoned vehicle.

182
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:12,700
Looks pretty bad.

183
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:14,703
- Bad?

184
00:12:14,703 --> 00:12:15,610
Bad, like in an accident?

185
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,050
- Nah, it's a poultry truck.

186
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:19,050
There's dead chickens
and blood everywhere.

187
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,650
Headlights are on, door's open,

188
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:23,260
but the driver got out in
a hurry and got whacked.

189
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,280
- I'll be right there,
run a trace on the plates.

190
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,940
- Copy that.

191
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:27,773
- I'll be back.

192
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:31,814
- [Ben] Oh, shit!

193
00:12:31,814 --> 00:12:32,647
- [Jim] What?

194
00:12:32,647 --> 00:12:33,480
- Look at this, Jim.

195
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,060
Carl Joseph broke out of prison.

196
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,390
- Christ, that's all we need.

197
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,093
- He's headed this way.

198
00:12:38,093 --> 00:12:39,532
- Ben, don't worry about it.

199
00:12:39,532 --> 00:12:40,450
It's not gonna happen again.

200
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:41,510
- What's not gonna happen again?

201
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,600
And who's this Carl Joseph guy?

202
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,433
Clark?

203
00:12:44,433 --> 00:12:45,266
- A bad dude.

204
00:12:45,266 --> 00:12:46,160
Jim and Ben put him away a couple

205
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,960
of years back, but it wasn't easy.

206
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,200
- He's threatened to come
back and burn the town down.

207
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,658
- Ain't gonna happen.

208
00:12:51,658 --> 00:12:53,120
- I'll shoot the son of a bitch first.

209
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:53,953
- Pin him up.

210
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:59,320
Honey, work until 11,
then let Clark take over.

211
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,344
See ya.

212
00:13:00,344 --> 00:13:02,070
- Yes, Daddy.

213
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:04,780
- Do not stop off with that Tommy guy.

214
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,180
He's too old for you, I mean it.

215
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,013
Alright?

216
00:13:07,013 --> 00:13:09,803
- That's exactly what I told
Barbara this morning about you.

217
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,183
- Oh, that's funny.

218
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,130
- Yeah, Clark, it's Mike.

219
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:21,475
I need you to run a
commercial plate for me.

220
00:13:21,475 --> 00:13:23,015
(growling)

221
00:13:23,015 --> 00:13:25,573
2918J5, right.

222
00:13:27,713 --> 00:13:28,546
(thudding)

223
00:13:28,546 --> 00:13:30,040
Shit, alright, shit!

224
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,383
I'm gonna have to call you back.

225
00:13:33,119 --> 00:13:35,488
(roaring)

226
00:13:35,488 --> 00:13:40,155
(crunching)
(screaming)

227
00:13:44,251 --> 00:13:46,367
- [Lola] You drive me crazy, Tommy.

228
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,476
- I love you so much, baby.

229
00:13:48,476 --> 00:13:51,552
I love you.

230
00:13:51,552 --> 00:13:52,629
(moaning)

231
00:13:52,629 --> 00:13:53,546
Oh, my God!

232
00:13:54,612 --> 00:13:56,464
(roaring)

233
00:13:56,464 --> 00:14:00,002
(stomping and hissing)

234
00:14:00,002 --> 00:14:02,355
- Oh, my God, what was that?

235
00:14:02,355 --> 00:14:04,121
What do you think it was?
- I don't know.

236
00:14:04,121 --> 00:14:05,664
(yelling)
(screaming)

237
00:14:05,664 --> 00:14:06,809
(laughs)

238
00:14:06,809 --> 00:14:08,620
Take it easy, baby, it's
just some stupid animal.

239
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,800
- Well, I don't like stupid animals.

240
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,260
Let's get dressed and get out of here.

241
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,960
- Okay, don't be scared, let's go.

242
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:16,989
- Are you ready?

243
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:18,620
- Hold on.

244
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,713
Oh shit, my wallet.

245
00:14:20,628 --> 00:14:21,461
- I wanna go home.

246
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:23,143
- I think I dropped it in the back.

247
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,740
I'll just be a second.

248
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,640
- Please, hurry.

249
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,740
- I'll be quick, baby.

250
00:14:30,201 --> 00:14:32,868
(ominous music)

251
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,783
(roaring)

252
00:14:39,783 --> 00:14:40,785
(thudding)
(squishing)

253
00:14:40,785 --> 00:14:43,607
(screaming)

254
00:14:43,607 --> 00:14:45,445
(roaring)

255
00:14:45,445 --> 00:14:48,195
(engine revving)

256
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:51,404
(crashing)

257
00:14:51,404 --> 00:14:52,604
- What the fuck?

258
00:14:52,604 --> 00:14:54,656
(glass shattering)
(growling)

259
00:14:54,656 --> 00:14:56,989
(screaming)

260
00:15:05,967 --> 00:15:10,634
(splashing)
(exploding)

261
00:15:17,991 --> 00:15:21,074
(cell phone ringing)

262
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:22,960
- [Barbara] Hello.

263
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,793
- Barbara?

264
00:15:23,793 --> 00:15:24,740
- Hey Jim, what's up?

265
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:27,980
- I've got another suspected
animal attack, Route 49,

266
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:30,270
three miles south of the overpass.

267
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,370
- I'll be right there.

268
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,140
- No, I already did that.

269
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,749
There's no sign of him.

270
00:15:38,749 --> 00:15:39,582
Yeah.

271
00:15:48,501 --> 00:15:51,418
Yeah, alright I'll get back to you.

272
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,940
- What happened, one of
your men get attacked?

273
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,967
- Well, I'm missing a deputy after

274
00:15:56,967 --> 00:15:58,240
he called me about that mess over there.

275
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,703
Here, go check it out,
tell me what you think.

276
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,803
Clark, what did Mike say to you

277
00:16:07,803 --> 00:16:09,603
when he told you he'd call you back?

278
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,347
Besides, 'oh, shit'?

279
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,810
Okay, well, put out an APB on
him and send me a tow truck.

280
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,900
I'm gonna impound both
these vehicles as evidence.

281
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,733
Uh-huh.

282
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:24,650
Well, what do you think?

283
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,280
- Don't step over the ground
while I'm looking for tracks!

284
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,113
- Sorry.

285
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,550
Well, the way I figure
it the driver pulled

286
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:35,230
over here to take a nap and the cougar,

287
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:38,212
or whatever it was, comes in
here 'cause of the chickens,

288
00:16:38,212 --> 00:16:40,124
you know, chickens make a lot of racket.

289
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,440
So the driver gets out to see what's up--

290
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,100
- No tracks here.

291
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,853
- Well, there goes that theory.

292
00:16:46,711 --> 00:16:48,447
- I wonder if the poultry company

293
00:16:48,447 --> 00:16:49,533
knew what they were shipping?

294
00:16:52,461 --> 00:16:55,461
(suspenseful music)

295
00:17:03,831 --> 00:17:04,664
- Okay.

296
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,580
According to this manifest here

297
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:10,014
they were moving laying hens from

298
00:17:10,014 --> 00:17:12,970
the Eunice Corporation
to some ranch in Utah.

299
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,203
- Eunice Corporation?

300
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,960
Doesn't sound much like
a poultry farm to me.

301
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,061
- Maybe not, something
to check out tomorrow.

302
00:17:20,061 --> 00:17:22,753
- [Ben On Radio] Vaca 30
calling Vaca 1, come in, over.

303
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:28,930
- This is Vaca 1, go Ben, over.

304
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:31,730
- [Ben] Sheriff, your daughter's
been hurt, not sure how.

305
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:32,610
- How bad?

306
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:34,470
- [Ben] Not sure, I'm at the hospital now.

307
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,530
- On my way.

308
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:37,450
- I'll follow you in my van.

309
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:40,117
(siren blaring)

310
00:17:41,725 --> 00:17:44,475
(dramatic music)

311
00:17:47,696 --> 00:17:49,654
- Hey, baby.

312
00:17:49,654 --> 00:17:51,640
How you feeling?

313
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,473
Honey?

314
00:17:52,473 --> 00:17:55,260
- I'm sorry, Sheriff, she can't hear you.

315
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,093
- What happened?

316
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:58,303
What happened?

317
00:17:58,303 --> 00:17:59,670
- Jim, we don't know.

318
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:00,890
A trucker found her by the side

319
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:03,220
of the road out by Lakeshore Drive.

320
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,000
He brought her in less
than a half an hour ago.

321
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,100
I questioned him, he's clean.

322
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,820
He's just a good Samaritan.

323
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,820
- And nothing from her?

324
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,250
- Not a single word, even though

325
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,140
her motor skills are perfectly intact.

326
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,847
- Baby, baby.

327
00:18:15,847 --> 00:18:17,063
Come on now, look at daddy.

328
00:18:18,357 --> 00:18:19,907
Baby doll, come on, look at me.

329
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,070
Honey, check in.

330
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:23,903
- [Doctor] Sheriff.

331
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:24,736
- Honey, it's your daddy.

332
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:26,600
I want you to talk, come on, look at me.

333
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,100
- Sheriff!

334
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,460
I'm afraid your daughter is suffering

335
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,510
from a rare form of traumatic catalepsia.

336
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,540
- And that would be what, doctor?

337
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:38,810
- Well, something so
terrified your girl that she

338
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:41,543
shut off part of her mind
to avoid thinking about it.

339
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,330
- That's not like her.

340
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,140
Baby, look at daddy.

341
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:48,883
Honey, I know something terrible
happened to you out there.

342
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,593
Honey?

343
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,370
And now what, doctor?

344
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:58,300
- Well, cases like this
are rather uncommon

345
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,530
and a bit out of my league.

346
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:03,300
But I can say that the
mind is very resilient.

347
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,560
In some instances, patients fully recover

348
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,150
in less than 24 hours.

349
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:09,290
- And other instances?

350
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:12,430
- Well, some people may
need an outside stimulus,

351
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:17,430
some sort of a sound or a picture
or smell to reawaken them.

352
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:18,893
- Thank you.

353
00:19:20,345 --> 00:19:21,178
Jim?

354
00:19:21,178 --> 00:19:22,011
- Yeah?

355
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,180
- This gets worse.

356
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,380
I dispatched a car out
where they found Lola.

357
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,213
- Uh-huh?

358
00:19:28,213 --> 00:19:30,220
- They found Leonetti's truck smashed

359
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:33,140
and burned down at the
bottom of Calopso Bridge

360
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,250
and a severed hand near the shoreline.

361
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,890
- Any witnesses?

362
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,250
- No.

363
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,083
- Baby?

364
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,960
Honey, daddy's gotta go.

365
00:19:44,196 --> 00:19:45,427
I love you, I love you, I love you.

366
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:50,830
Doctor, do whatever you can, alright?

367
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,773
- We'll take good care of her.

368
00:19:52,773 --> 00:19:54,890
Sheriff, I want you to
get some rest, all of you.

369
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:57,407
I'll call you first thing in
the morning with an update.

370
00:19:58,268 --> 00:20:00,851
(somber music)

371
00:20:21,191 --> 00:20:24,108
(doorbell ringing)

372
00:20:25,232 --> 00:20:26,100
- [Jim] You ready to go?

373
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,740
- Yeah, how is she?

374
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:31,170
- Doctor says she's fine but
no change, whatever that means.

375
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:33,140
You still want to go out to
Eunice with me and check it out?

376
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:33,973
- I'm game.

377
00:20:35,745 --> 00:20:36,578
What?

378
00:20:38,789 --> 00:20:40,010
- The last time I heard you say that to me

379
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:41,780
I believe I spent the weekend of my life.

380
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:42,613
Let's go.

381
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:52,563
- Lyle?

382
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:56,830
Are you in or are you out?

383
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:59,150
You're worse than a cat!

384
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,980
- If I could have a word, sir.

385
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,153
- Yes, what is it?

386
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,133
- In private.

387
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:08,343
- If you'll excuse us,
I'll talk to you later.

388
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,103
What is it now, Lyle?

389
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,320
- I feel terrible about what happened.

390
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,970
- And you're telling me this because?

391
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:22,040
- I really think I ought to leave.

392
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,320
- It wasn't your fault, Lyle.

393
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,570
We only lost one.

394
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:27,910
- But those kids, the radio said--

395
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:30,700
- There you go again,
Lyle, you work yourself up,

396
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,290
you're jumping to conclusions.

397
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:34,580
Even I don't know what happened for sure.

398
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:37,370
Perhaps it was our precious
little T-Rex, perhaps.

399
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:40,690
Or maybe, maybe it was just a wild animal.

400
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:43,270
- We could be guilty
of criminal negligence.

401
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,800
- Don't be absurd!

402
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,580
Accidents happen.

403
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:49,390
Yes, of course, there was
the unfortunate incident.

404
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:50,660
The Army had to shut us down.

405
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:53,270
They had to, Lyle, it
was government funding.

406
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,290
They have to distance themselves.

407
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:58,230
There were never any
criminal charges, were there?

408
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:59,560
- No, but I--

409
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,230
- Lyle, we are so close!

410
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:04,420
A dinosaur with a brain, a creature

411
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,750
of superior strength, size, intelligence!

412
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,470
We can train them to work with men;

413
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,680
land clearing, mining, shock troops.

414
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,793
- They could be pretty shocking, alright.

415
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:18,596
I don't wanna go to jail
for second degree murder.

416
00:22:18,596 --> 00:22:20,940
- Well, I'm sorry that you feel that way.

417
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,050
I don't have to remind you that

418
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:24,790
you did sign a confidentiality clause

419
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:26,860
when you came to work for me, huh?

420
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,650
- I know that.

421
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:29,650
- Of course, you do.

422
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,360
Well then, thank you.

423
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,560
Thank you for your time.

424
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,313
I value it.

425
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,960
Before you go there's one last thing

426
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,960
that I was going to ask
you to do this afternoon.

427
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,300
It has to do with the training
session of the Aplha T-Rex.

428
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,870
- Isn't that Karen's department?

429
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:50,680
- Normally yes, but it was something

430
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,610
that you said last week
that made me think.

431
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:54,360
I'm curious how it will react

432
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,600
to the unfamiliar, such as yourself.

433
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,720
Normally, Karen is working with him.

434
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,100
So perhaps on the way out
you could just walk down

435
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,830
the laser corridor and I could monitor it.

436
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,123
I'd really appreciate it.

437
00:23:06,154 --> 00:23:08,821
(ominous music)

438
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,720
Lyle, you're approaching
the laser corridor now.

439
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,760
Just keep going, Lyle, you're doing fine.

440
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,640
Now remember, you're going to experience

441
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,230
some discomfort because the area

442
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:45,923
is climate controlled for
the subject; hot and humid.

443
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:50,170
You're doing just fine, Lyle, keep going.

444
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:53,503
Now remember, I've got the
T-Rex immobilized by the lasers.

445
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:56,487
He can't move, but you can.

446
00:23:58,244 --> 00:24:00,409
(suspenseful music)

447
00:24:00,409 --> 00:24:03,159
(lasers humming)

448
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,200
- Look sinister enough?

449
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,530
- Maybe we should have called first.

450
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:28,765
- It's more fun surprising them.

451
00:24:28,765 --> 00:24:31,340
(buzzing)

452
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,620
- Yeah, who is it?

453
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,969
- This is Sheriff Tanner from

454
00:24:33,969 --> 00:24:35,520
the Vaca County Sheriff's Department.

455
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,290
I'd like to speak to the person in charge.

456
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:39,633
- You mind if I ask what
it's about, Sheriff?

457
00:24:39,633 --> 00:24:41,290
- Yeah, just a routine investigation.

458
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:43,340
- Yeah, okay, hold on, I'll check.

459
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,602
- He'll check.

460
00:24:44,602 --> 00:24:47,360
(laughs)

461
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,150
- Sir, we have a local
sheriff at the gate.

462
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:52,540
Wants to speak to the man in charge.

463
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,563
- I'm not here.

464
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:58,820
Go on, Lyle, I'm still with you.

465
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:01,270
Just keep going until I tell you to stop.

466
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:03,970
You're completely protected
by the laser barrier.

467
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,845
Now reach out and touch it.

468
00:25:05,845 --> 00:25:07,437
You'll see what I mean.

469
00:25:07,437 --> 00:25:08,640
(zapping)
(flinching)

470
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,700
See, just a little jolt.

471
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,763
The barrier around the T-Rex
is a hundred times stronger.

472
00:25:17,219 --> 00:25:19,386
(roaring)

473
00:25:22,371 --> 00:25:24,704
(screaming)

474
00:25:30,514 --> 00:25:32,847
(screaming)

475
00:25:37,245 --> 00:25:40,084
(roaring)

476
00:25:40,084 --> 00:25:42,417
(screaming)

477
00:25:53,082 --> 00:25:54,170
- I don't know what to tell you, Sheriff.

478
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:55,310
I looked all over for him.

479
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:57,900
He's nowhere to be found.

480
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:58,760
- And you are?

481
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,710
- Oh, I'm Josh McCoy, head of security.

482
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,800
- Well, Mr. McCoy, we've had some unusual

483
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:08,800
animal attacks and I was
wondering-- (roaring)

484
00:26:09,187 --> 00:26:11,210
What the hell was that?

485
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:12,950
- Oh, that's, uh...

486
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:15,993
That's just a fuel
pressure control release.

487
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:21,560
- Mr. McCoy, would you tell, uh...

488
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:24,660
- Doctor, Dr. Hyde.

489
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:25,870
- Dr. Hyde?

490
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:27,270
- Yep.

491
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:30,260
- Would you tell Dr. Hyde
we'll be back tomorrow?

492
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,710
- I'll do that.

493
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:33,463
- Well, thank you very much.

494
00:26:33,463 --> 00:26:34,473
- [McCoy] No problem.

495
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,820
- Did you hear that?

496
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,200
- Yeah, we both did.

497
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,150
Two days ago at the murder site.

498
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:55,410
It was lower, it was further away,

499
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:57,260
but it was definitely the same sound.

500
00:26:58,126 --> 00:27:00,053
I even got it on my tape recorder.

501
00:27:01,777 --> 00:27:03,253
Which gives me an idea.

502
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,800
- He's coming back tomorrow.

503
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,673
He may be a little bit more
difficult to get rid of.

504
00:27:10,673 --> 00:27:12,730
- Hmm, the problem is we
don't know what he's found.

505
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:15,550
He could come back with a search warrant.

506
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,920
- So what do you want me to do?

507
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,570
- Check him out.

508
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,530
I want to know who this
Sheriff is and I'd like

509
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:23,160
to know some information
about the woman with him.

510
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,160
- Shouldn't be a problem.

511
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:27,143
- And if he does come
back bring him to me.

512
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,550
I'll take care of it.

513
00:27:30,744 --> 00:27:33,494
(sinister music)

514
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:43,010
Why does this have to
happen when we're so close?

515
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:44,650
- What's that?

516
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:47,203
- Lyle, he's quit.

517
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:50,000
- He quit?

518
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,570
- You just missed him.

519
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:52,770
- Well, he never said anything.

520
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:56,053
- He's gone to work for
a firm in Silicon Valley.

521
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:04,780
- You know, doctor, you
should really get some rest.

522
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,380
- We have to finish this, Karen.

523
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:08,613
You and I.

524
00:28:10,854 --> 00:28:13,604
(dramatic music)

525
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,370
- Doctor, you said that
sometimes a certain stimulus

526
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:32,320
could bring a patient out
of traumatic syndrome.

527
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,480
I think I have that stimulus
right here on my tape recorder.

528
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,313
- Let's try it.

529
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,290
- You ready?

530
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:45,123
- Let it rip.

531
00:28:48,292 --> 00:28:50,459
(roaring)

532
00:28:53,777 --> 00:28:55,080
- This might work.

533
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,773
Looks like she's coming out of it.

534
00:28:58,212 --> 00:29:01,093
(screaming)

535
00:29:01,093 --> 00:29:02,454
- It's alright, daddy's here.

536
00:29:02,454 --> 00:29:03,741
It's alright, it's okay!

537
00:29:03,741 --> 00:29:04,574
(crying)

538
00:29:04,574 --> 00:29:05,407
Oh, baby.

539
00:29:05,407 --> 00:29:07,060
- Oh God, daddy, it was awful!

540
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:10,340
It was some kind of lizard or
something and it got Tommy!

541
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:13,570
It got Tommy and then it
started to come after me!

542
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:16,004
And it was clawing at my neck.

543
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:18,292
I didn't know what to do.

544
00:29:18,292 --> 00:29:19,125
I didn't know.

545
00:29:19,125 --> 00:29:21,136
- She may still be delusional.

546
00:29:21,136 --> 00:29:23,219
- I seriously doubt that.

547
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,143
- Look, I am not crazy!

548
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:29,163
I know what I saw!

549
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:35,720
Daddy, you've gotta find
it and you gotta kill it.

550
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,230
- That's the plan, baby.

551
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:41,323
Honey, lie down and relax.

552
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,999
I'm gonna go find him and I'll check in

553
00:29:44,999 --> 00:29:46,792
with you in the morning, alright?

554
00:29:46,792 --> 00:29:47,850
Honey, you okay?

555
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:48,683
- Yeah.

556
00:29:48,683 --> 00:29:49,516
- [Jim] You okay?

557
00:29:49,516 --> 00:29:50,349
Calm down.

558
00:29:50,349 --> 00:29:51,182
- Please don't go.

559
00:29:51,182 --> 00:29:52,050
Please don't leave me.

560
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:54,000
Please take me with you, daddy, please.

561
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,040
- I wouldn't recommend it.

562
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,120
- We should listen to the doctor.

563
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,133
He's got a degree.

564
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:17,710
Barbara, I gotta tell
you, I was really worried.

565
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:20,020
If you hadn't come up with
that tape recorder idea

566
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,660
who knows when she would
have come out of it.

567
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,580
- Forget it.

568
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,837
What worries me more is what she said

569
00:30:24,837 --> 00:30:26,830
about that lizard thing she saw.

570
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,260
I mean, if she's not mistaken,

571
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:31,060
and I seriously doubt that she is,

572
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:34,280
we're facing some truly new
and frightening menace here.

573
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,586
- This is so weird.

574
00:30:36,586 --> 00:30:38,230
- You know, for some
reason you're much nicer

575
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:40,310
when you're not trying
to act like Mr. Cool.

576
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:41,143
- I am?

577
00:30:41,143 --> 00:30:42,133
- Yeah, you are.

578
00:30:43,021 --> 00:30:44,571
- (laughs) That's nice to know.

579
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:47,003
- Come here.

580
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:55,593
- Well, what do think,
have I still got it?

581
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:58,280
- Not bad for an old guy.

582
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,283
- An old guy?

583
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,580
I get a little gray at the temples

584
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:03,370
and I'm suddenly an antique?

585
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:05,583
- Some antiques are highly sought after.

586
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:10,853
Prize possessions.

587
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,810
Worth seeking out.

588
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:18,320
Worth bringing in for a nightcap.

589
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,153
- Barbara,

590
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:22,183
I would love to,

591
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:26,100
but there's something I gotta do.

592
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:31,096
- You're going back to Eunice, aren't you?

593
00:31:31,096 --> 00:31:32,430
You can't even wait till tomorrow.

594
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:34,510
- Some things can't wait
and this is one of them.

595
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:36,860
- Well then, don't you
think you ought to bring me?

596
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,483
- No, gotta go solo.

597
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:41,803
I got a feeling something
is way wrong out there

598
00:31:41,803 --> 00:31:43,603
and it could get really hairy, so...

599
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,840
Thanks for the memories.

600
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,833
- You're never gonna change, Jim Tanner.

601
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:58,823
- You know, you've got really soft lips.

602
00:31:59,698 --> 00:32:00,531
- Bye.

603
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:09,509
(ominous music)

604
00:32:28,734 --> 00:32:31,651
(water sprinkling)

605
00:33:19,201 --> 00:33:20,304
(barking)
(screaming)

606
00:33:20,304 --> 00:33:21,147
- Oh, Max!

607
00:33:21,147 --> 00:33:22,953
You scared me, baby!

608
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,210
- Jim?

609
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,064
Jim, if you're there, pick up!

610
00:33:34,064 --> 00:33:36,000
- He can't hear you, he's on a code five.

611
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,840
- What the hell is he staking out?

612
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,329
- He didn't say, but I
couldn't get ahold of him.

613
00:33:39,329 --> 00:33:40,162
- Oh, great!

614
00:33:40,162 --> 00:33:42,040
Jim, listen, I think Carl Joseph's back.

615
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,260
I got three emergency calls from downtown

616
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:47,030
reporting vandalism,
break-ins and looting.

617
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:49,010
The clerk at Hal's Liquor said somebody's

618
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:51,503
smashing store windows
right now down the street.

619
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:54,953
I'm gonna go check it out.

620
00:33:54,953 --> 00:33:56,981
- You're not going down
there alone, are you?

621
00:33:56,981 --> 00:33:58,940
You know what the Sheriff
says about backup.

622
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,570
- Don't worry about me, I'll be alright.

623
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:02,663
This time I'll be ready
for the motherfucker!

624
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:07,030
(dramatic music)

625
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:08,700
- This is Hanson calling for Vaca 1.

626
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,503
Hanson for Vaca 1, come in.

627
00:34:33,606 --> 00:34:36,189
(tender music)

628
00:35:05,441 --> 00:35:07,358
- Come on, come on out!

629
00:35:08,522 --> 00:35:11,154
(suspenseful music)

630
00:35:11,154 --> 00:35:15,340
I know you're in here,
I know you're in here.

631
00:35:23,047 --> 00:35:25,128
I know you're here, come on out!

632
00:35:25,128 --> 00:35:26,589
I've been waiting for you!

633
00:35:26,589 --> 00:35:28,256
Right here, come on!

634
00:35:31,165 --> 00:35:32,832
Got nothing to lose!

635
00:35:50,062 --> 00:35:50,895
Here I am.

636
00:35:52,912 --> 00:35:53,745
Here I am.

637
00:35:56,497 --> 00:35:58,580
It's just me and you now.

638
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:07,323
We'll go down together, come on.

639
00:36:09,825 --> 00:36:12,575
(birds chirping)

640
00:36:22,865 --> 00:36:25,115
(flapping)

641
00:36:26,465 --> 00:36:27,715
Show your face!

642
00:36:29,077 --> 00:36:31,688
(growling)

643
00:36:31,688 --> 00:36:34,221
(roaring)

644
00:36:34,221 --> 00:36:36,641
(gun firing)

645
00:36:36,641 --> 00:36:38,808
(roaring)

646
00:36:40,422 --> 00:36:42,672
(thudding)

647
00:36:52,271 --> 00:36:55,021
(dramatic music)

648
00:37:07,138 --> 00:37:10,036
(growling)

649
00:37:10,036 --> 00:37:15,036
That's for some peace and quiet.

650
00:37:16,595 --> 00:37:17,580
(growling)

651
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,913
(squishing)

652
00:37:28,873 --> 00:37:31,456
(horn honking)

653
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:47,820
- Jim, I'm really sorry.

654
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:49,110
When did it happen?

655
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:50,290
- Last night.

656
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:52,130
Whatever got him ripped his insides out,

657
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:54,133
deep punctures, a lot of blood.

658
00:37:54,133 --> 00:37:57,350
- Listen, identifying animal
attacks is my depeartment.

659
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:58,430
You don't have to.

660
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:00,533
- It's better if I ID him than his wife.

661
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:10,000
- Hi, can I help you?

662
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:10,833
- Glover?

663
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,770
- Right this way.

664
00:38:29,684 --> 00:38:34,434
- Why don't you go in the
other room while I take a look?

665
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:46,333
- Sheriff, you still got
a missing deputy, right?

666
00:38:46,333 --> 00:38:47,690
- Mike Baltin, yeah.

667
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:49,730
- Um, I just got this coroner's report on

668
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:52,480
a dead body found on a ranch
just over the county line.

669
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:55,033
Body's been partially eaten.

670
00:39:06,354 --> 00:39:09,104
(dramatic music)

671
00:39:17,324 --> 00:39:18,157
- So?

672
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,550
- I'm almost afraid to say.

673
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:24,350
I found this embedded in Ben's thorax.

674
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:25,830
- What is that, some kind of claw?

675
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,493
- It's not a claw, it's a tooth.

676
00:39:28,436 --> 00:39:29,720
- Wow.

677
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,619
We're gonna need bigger guns.

678
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:32,452
- Yeah.

679
00:39:33,627 --> 00:39:36,627
(suspenseful music)

680
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:50,180
- Yeah, sorry to keep you
waiting, Sheriff Tanner,

681
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:54,920
but we have no files on
anything called Eunice.

682
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,450
- Well, thanks anyway.

683
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:57,870
- You know, there may
be certain factors here

684
00:39:57,870 --> 00:40:00,460
that require more extensive
cross-referencing.

685
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,630
- What kind of factors?

686
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:04,050
- Linkages that aren't
immediately apparent.

687
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:05,120
- What about Carl Joseph?

688
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,810
Might he have something to do with this?

689
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:10,170
- He was arrested in Boise by
police yesterday afternoon.

690
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:11,830
- Well, that's good news.

691
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:15,030
- Listen, Sheriff, I'd like
you to keep me informed.

692
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:18,143
If you turn anything up,
call me, day or night.

693
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:19,953
- No problem.

694
00:40:22,626 --> 00:40:25,376
(dramatic music)

695
00:40:30,281 --> 00:40:31,590
(telephone ringing)

696
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:33,340
- [Receptionist] Morning,
this is Project Bluebook.

697
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,773
- Yeah, give me extension 7B.

698
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:40,039
- You didn't tell him
about the sound we heard.

699
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:41,516
- Right, 'cause we're going back

700
00:40:41,516 --> 00:40:42,349
with a search warrant this time.

701
00:40:42,349 --> 00:40:44,553
I'm pretty sure the Eunice Corporation

702
00:40:44,553 --> 00:40:46,700
is a front for more than fresh eggs.

703
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:47,700
Clark!

704
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,570
Call the FBI, the number's
on the desk, Agent Wylie!

705
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:52,053
- Whatever you say, Sheriff!

706
00:40:53,557 --> 00:40:54,657
Excuse me, one second.

707
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:58,610
- Hey, this is my case, too.

708
00:40:58,610 --> 00:40:59,510
I'm coming with you.

709
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:01,363
- Where did I put it?

710
00:41:01,363 --> 00:41:03,020
Where did I put it?

711
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:05,160
Okay, tell Clark to
get me a search warrant

712
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,560
and to get it to me while
I make this last call.

713
00:41:13,057 --> 00:41:17,570
- [Barbara] The Sheriff needs
a search warrant right now.

714
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:19,780
- Miss Anderson, Sheriff Tanner.

715
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:21,430
- Look Sheriff, I already
told you that I can't--

716
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:23,230
- No, it's not about my bill again.

717
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,820
This is official business.

718
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:25,653
- What is it?

719
00:41:25,653 --> 00:41:26,910
- I need you to shut off the power

720
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:29,600
to the Eunice Corporation
in one hour's time,

721
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,990
unless you hear from me otherwise.

722
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:32,710
- I need a good reason to, Sheriff.

723
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:34,680
- Well, I'm investigating them

724
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,620
in connection with six deaths.

725
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:38,770
I'm on the way over there
now with a search warrant.

726
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:40,467
And if I don't get out of there

727
00:41:40,467 --> 00:41:42,130
in a hurry I may be the seventh victim.

728
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:43,060
- Well, I guess that's okay,

729
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:44,630
but I'd like something in writing.

730
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:47,260
- Okay, I'll fax it over right away.

731
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:48,610
Then will you do it?

732
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:49,910
- If I don't hear from you before then

733
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:51,120
I'll shut off the power at 3 p.m.

734
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,537
Right?

735
00:41:52,537 --> 00:41:54,730
- Right, thank you, Miss Henderson.

736
00:41:54,730 --> 00:41:57,070
- I appreciate your position, Agent Wylie,

737
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:58,810
but I can assure you we sold it off

738
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:01,350
to the private sector 12 years ago.

739
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:02,960
- And you've had no further involvement?

740
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,750
- No, we do not have
any ongoing commitment

741
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:08,680
or relationship whatsoever
with the Vaca Flats facility.

742
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,000
- [Wylie] Are you sure?

743
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,357
- Yes, thank you.

744
00:42:12,888 --> 00:42:15,638
(dramatic music)

745
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,033
- [Secretary] Yes, sir?

746
00:42:20,033 --> 00:42:23,470
- Get me Dr. Hyde at the
Eunice Corporation right now.

747
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:24,820
- [Secretary] Alright, sir.

748
00:42:26,407 --> 00:42:28,880
(telephone ringing)

749
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,713
- Control room.

750
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:30,940
- [Secretary] May I speak to Dr. Hyde?

751
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:32,837
- Can I tell him who's calling?

752
00:42:32,837 --> 00:42:34,657
- [Secretary] Colonel Von Vandamar.

753
00:42:34,657 --> 00:42:35,985
- Colonel Vandamar.

754
00:42:35,985 --> 00:42:36,900
- Ah!

755
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:39,520
Hey, congratulations on your promotion!

756
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,000
- Doctor, let me come
straight to the point.

757
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,390
We terminated your research
with us 12 years ago.

758
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:44,410
Did we not?

759
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:46,020
- Unfortunately, yes.

760
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,270
- Well, it's come to our attention

761
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:49,330
that there have been
unexplained fatalities

762
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:52,020
in the vicinity of your research facility.

763
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:54,020
Very much like the
incidents that caused us

764
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:56,120
to terminate the Jurassic Storm project.

765
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:59,040
- Oh, I don't know what
you're talking about.

766
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,399
- Have you privately
reactivated the project?

767
00:43:01,399 --> 00:43:04,590
- Of course not, Major,
uh, Colonel Vandamar.

768
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:06,560
Even if I wanted to, how
could I possibly find

769
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,210
that kind of funding
in the private sector?

770
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:10,630
Without backing of the highest government

771
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:13,250
and military levels it
would be unthinkable.

772
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:15,110
No one would touch it, would they?

773
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:17,040
- May I ask what you are doing?

774
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,483
- Applications on the
human genome project.

775
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:22,070
- Very well, doctor.

776
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:24,230
I'm sorry to have disturbed you.

777
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:26,160
Thank you for your time.

778
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,703
- Anytime, Colonel.

779
00:43:33,816 --> 00:43:35,600
(buzzing)

780
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:36,560
- Yep?

781
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,780
- Sheriff Tanner to see Dr. Hyde.

782
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:39,880
- Yeah, just a minute.

783
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:44,110
Doctor, the Sheriff and that
animal control woman are back.

784
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:45,210
- I'll be right there.

785
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:48,950
Karen, I'd like you to recheck the work

786
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:51,790
that Lyle was doing on
the neurotransmitters.

787
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:54,743
His work was rather sloppy
in the last several weeks.

788
00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:57,100
- Do you want me to go with you?

789
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:58,520
- No, no, no, no, I'll handle it.

790
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:01,200
Please just recheck the settings.

791
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,033
- Yes, sir.

792
00:44:06,463 --> 00:44:07,700
(ominous music)

793
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:09,103
- Buzzing you in, Sheriff.

794
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:36,720
- Ah, Sheriff, Miss Phillips.

795
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,330
I'm sorry, I wasn't advised as to

796
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:39,520
what time you'd be here today.

797
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:42,000
I was actually on my way to a meeting.

798
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,640
I'd be happy to stop by your office later

799
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,290
if that works for you.

800
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:47,560
- There's no time for that, Dr. Hyde.

801
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,393
I have a search warrant.

802
00:44:48,393 --> 00:44:51,010
- Ah well, that won't be necessary.

803
00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:53,740
I'm happy to answer any
questions that you might have.

804
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:56,710
First, could I offer you some
coffee, perhaps some tea?

805
00:44:56,710 --> 00:44:57,543
- No, thanks.

806
00:44:57,543 --> 00:44:58,573
- None for me, thanks.

807
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:02,450
- Ah yes, singlemindedness
in the pursuit of the truth.

808
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:04,230
As a scientist I have to admire that.

809
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:06,490
Sheriff, how can I help you?

810
00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:07,940
- I'm investigating six deaths

811
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:09,400
which were the result of attacks by

812
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:12,330
an unknown wild animal or animals.

813
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:14,830
They all occurred within
five miles of this place.

814
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,883
- Well, I'm sorry to hear about that.

815
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:22,830
I can't see how I would be of any help.

816
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:25,870
Actually, I'm not much
of a wildlife enthusiast.

817
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:28,820
- Are you doing any research
into animal testing?

818
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:29,653
- A bit.

819
00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:34,550
- Well, I did some checking
before we came up here

820
00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:36,690
and according to the internet, Dr. Hyde,

821
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:39,375
you may be the world's
top animal behaviorist.

822
00:45:39,375 --> 00:45:41,630
- Oh Sheriff, you have done
your homework, haven't you?

823
00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:43,010
I am very impressed.

824
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:45,200
- So what kind of animals
are you working on now?

825
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,410
- Actually, I'm working on
the human genome project

826
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:49,911
and occasionally we have to compare

827
00:45:49,911 --> 00:45:51,420
the human and animal gene sequences.

828
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:53,090
Did you know that we share 99%

829
00:45:53,090 --> 00:45:55,450
of our genes with the domestic cat?

830
00:45:55,450 --> 00:45:56,410
- No.

831
00:45:56,410 --> 00:45:59,440
- The animal we heard yesterday
was a lot bigger than a cat.

832
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,390
And so were the prints and
the tooth that I found.

833
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:03,131
- Could it be, Miss Phillips,

834
00:46:03,131 --> 00:46:04,220
that your imagination is as strong as

835
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:06,233
your power of observation and logic?

836
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:08,600
- Dr. Hyde.

837
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:09,970
- As I said, that won't be necessary.

838
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:11,430
I'm happy to show you the labs.

839
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:13,363
Please, I have nothing to hide.

840
00:46:14,410 --> 00:46:15,360
- Show us the labs.

841
00:46:17,163 --> 00:46:18,253
- Follow me.

842
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:27,120
We'll start with the sequencing lab.

843
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:28,020
Please, after you.

844
00:46:28,970 --> 00:46:29,803
Sheriff.

845
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:33,703
All aboard.

846
00:46:36,623 --> 00:46:38,410
(elevator music)

847
00:46:38,410 --> 00:46:40,230
- How many floors down does this thing go?

848
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:43,543
- Six, it used to be a
nuclear testing facility.

849
00:46:45,347 --> 00:46:47,210
(roaring)

850
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:48,043
- What was that?

851
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:53,757
- I believe it's "Stranger in Paradise".

852
00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:11,477
(ominous music)

853
00:47:20,563 --> 00:47:21,930
As you can see, it takes a lot

854
00:47:21,930 --> 00:47:24,093
of power to manipulate the sequencing.

855
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:26,690
- Seems like all of this gene splicing

856
00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:27,523
would be really, really--

857
00:47:27,523 --> 00:47:29,140
- What, expensive?
- Yeah, expensive.

858
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:31,550
- What is the price of dream, Sheriff?

859
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:33,680
If my experiments work
out I can assure you

860
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,860
all mankind will be knocking at my door.

861
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:39,723
- But the question is,
whether to get in or get out?

862
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:43,370
- You may scoff all you
want, Miss Phillips,

863
00:47:43,370 --> 00:47:45,530
but when my work is
complete the entire story

864
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:49,650
of DNA research will have to
be rewritten from scratch.

865
00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:50,930
- Really?

866
00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:52,170
Well then, I guess I'd like to start

867
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:54,707
with a chapter where you somehow manage

868
00:47:54,707 --> 00:47:57,010
to clone a dinosaur that escapes

869
00:47:57,010 --> 00:47:59,760
and murders a half a
dozen innocent people.

870
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,710
- Your lady friend isn't a very
good poker player, Sheriff.

871
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:07,830
She's just revealed her hand.

872
00:48:07,830 --> 00:48:09,453
- Actually, I prefer dominoes.

873
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:13,220
See, like the Sheriff here, I
did a little surfing myself.

874
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:16,670
Read all up on your research history;

875
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:20,240
cloning from fossil DNA,
failed government project,

876
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,423
loss of funding.

877
00:48:22,410 --> 00:48:23,243
- Yes.

878
00:48:24,290 --> 00:48:25,660
That is enough.

879
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:26,493
- Hold it.

880
00:48:26,493 --> 00:48:27,820
- No, you hold it, Sheriff!

881
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:30,010
- Guns, guns, guns.

882
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:33,113
At this point I'll have to
refer to an old western cliche.

883
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:35,333
Put 'em up, partner.

884
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:39,470
(dramatic music)

885
00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:44,163
And our tour is over, please follow me.

886
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:53,263
Off we go.

887
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:01,073
Inside you go.

888
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:03,013
Go on.

889
00:49:05,854 --> 00:49:09,521
(speaking foreign language)

890
00:49:11,790 --> 00:49:12,970
- I don't like the sound of that.

891
00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:14,497
- Oh, you don't, huh?

892
00:49:14,497 --> 00:49:15,390
Well, if you kept your trap shut

893
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:17,296
we wouldn't be stuck in here.

894
00:49:17,296 --> 00:49:18,129
(rattling)

895
00:49:18,129 --> 00:49:19,710
- Like Hyde didn't have some ulterior plan

896
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:21,860
to keep us detained, did he?

897
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:22,693
- [Jim] Damn it!

898
00:49:22,693 --> 00:49:25,080
I should never have broken
my rule about backup.

899
00:49:27,270 --> 00:49:29,703
- Would you mind telling me how
we're gonna get out of here?

900
00:49:31,103 --> 00:49:32,560
(grunting)

901
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:33,393
- Oh, man!

902
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:37,610
It's gonna be awhile, Barbara.

903
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:45,120
- Yes, yeah, the call came in
no more than five minutes ago.

904
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:47,538
According to the deputy,
Hanson, the Sheriff

905
00:49:47,538 --> 00:49:50,080
of Vaca Flats went out to
Eunice over an hour ago.

906
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,940
He has not been heard from since.

907
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:53,180
He also says that he had the place

908
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:55,110
staked out most of last night.

909
00:49:55,110 --> 00:49:56,390
Yeah.

910
00:49:56,390 --> 00:49:59,040
- Okay, Mark, I'll be getting
back to you, thank you.

911
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:06,300
Well General, it looks like
Dr. Hyde has lied to us.

912
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:08,980
I believe he has
reactivated Jurassic Storm.

913
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:10,680
- How could he do that?

914
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:11,820
Where the hell would he get the money?

915
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:14,310
- The FBI ran traces on his phone.

916
00:50:14,310 --> 00:50:16,140
There have been calls to Pakistan.

917
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:18,840
And of course, we don't know
for sure what that means.

918
00:50:20,339 --> 00:50:22,350
- The son of a bitch is
getting foreign funding.

919
00:50:22,350 --> 00:50:24,800
- General, if it ever came out that we had

920
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,283
anything to do with the original project.

921
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,493
- Shut him down.

922
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:33,600
Get Special Ops in the air right away.

923
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:35,200
Make sure it's a dark operation.

924
00:50:38,355 --> 00:50:39,320
- [Secretary] Yes, sir?

925
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,728
- Get me Delta Command right away.

926
00:50:41,728 --> 00:50:44,229
(helicopter whirring)

927
00:50:44,229 --> 00:50:46,312
- Go, go, go, go, go, go!

928
00:50:47,425 --> 00:50:52,425
Move, move, let's go, let's go!

929
00:50:54,450 --> 00:50:56,660
Delta 29, Delta 29, this is Alpha 14,

930
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:57,943
ready for takeoff, over.

931
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:00,270
- Hold up.

932
00:51:00,270 --> 00:51:01,713
Alpha 14, this is Delta 29.

933
00:51:01,713 --> 00:51:02,890
Trip just arrived.

934
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:05,550
Estimated time of departure, 45 seconds.

935
00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:07,300
Stand by for my command.

936
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:08,133
Let's go!

937
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:13,240
- Devinger, take her up!

938
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:14,073
- Yes, sir!

939
00:51:16,544 --> 00:51:19,711
(helicopter whirring)

940
00:51:24,450 --> 00:51:25,430
- On the chopper now!

941
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:28,100
Let's go, come on, Benny, get in there!

942
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:29,904
Let's go, light it up!

943
00:51:29,904 --> 00:51:31,404
Alright, let's go!

944
00:51:32,337 --> 00:51:33,670
Double check your gear.

945
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:35,960
Make sure your weapons are on safe.

946
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:41,217
Alpha 14, Alpha 14, this is Delta 29.

947
00:51:41,217 --> 00:51:42,567
What the hell are you doing?

948
00:51:42,567 --> 00:51:43,980
You're supposed to wait
for my command to take off.

949
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:45,640
This is a joint operation, over.

950
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:48,030
- Roger that, Delta 29, but takeoff

951
00:51:48,030 --> 00:51:50,700
is now 14:35 Marine time.

952
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:51,533
Gotcha, Connolly!

953
00:51:51,533 --> 00:51:53,003
- Alpha 14, this is Delta 29.

954
00:51:53,003 --> 00:51:55,140
This is not a training mission!

955
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:57,110
This is the real deal!

956
00:51:57,110 --> 00:51:58,220
Now, if you don't get with the program

957
00:51:58,220 --> 00:52:00,921
I'm gonna have your
ass busted down a rank!

958
00:52:00,921 --> 00:52:02,350
- They're having a pissing contest again.

959
00:52:02,350 --> 00:52:04,648
- Yeah, and we're always downwind.

960
00:52:04,648 --> 00:52:06,147
- Lance, catch up with Alpha 14.

961
00:52:06,147 --> 00:52:08,780
You catch him, I'll buy
you a fucking Cadillac.

962
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:10,286
Go!

963
00:52:10,286 --> 00:52:13,036
(dramatic music)

964
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:25,920
- Alright, listen up.

965
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,440
After we secure the perimeter,

966
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:28,800
we'll enter through the northeast wing

967
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,610
and sweep sector by sector
looking for civilians.

968
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:33,330
We'll rendezvous back
at the freight elevator

969
00:52:33,330 --> 00:52:35,530
at level one and meet Delta 29 there.

970
00:52:35,530 --> 00:52:36,363
Got it?

971
00:52:36,363 --> 00:52:37,520
- Yes, sir.

972
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:38,954
- Got it.

973
00:52:38,954 --> 00:52:42,121
(helicopter whirring)

974
00:52:44,430 --> 00:52:46,740
- How did it go with our visitors?

975
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:47,573
- Excellent.

976
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:52,291
(ominous music)

977
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:59,880
- Damn, I told that idiot three o'clock.

978
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:01,950
- Which one?

979
00:53:01,950 --> 00:53:03,600
There's tons of them around here.

980
00:53:05,330 --> 00:53:06,163
- Yeah, I know.

981
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:13,720
- Once we link up with
York we're gonna work

982
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:15,799
our way down through the building,

983
00:53:15,799 --> 00:53:17,170
level by level till we
locate these targets.

984
00:53:17,170 --> 00:53:19,240
- And our orders are
to search and destroy.

985
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:20,970
- What exactly are we looking for, sir?

986
00:53:20,970 --> 00:53:22,680
- That's classified, soldier,

987
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:24,140
but you'll know 'em when you see 'em.

988
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:26,020
- Anybody have any questions at all?

989
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:27,310
- What are the targets, sir?

990
00:53:27,310 --> 00:53:28,740
- It's a need-to-know basis, Lewis.

991
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:30,980
When you need to know, you will know.

992
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:33,280
- Animal, vegetable, mineral?

993
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,233
- What are those, things
you had in your ass?

994
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:37,840
Listen, all I can tell you people

995
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:40,240
is it's organic and it's
been genetically engineered

996
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:43,223
and it is dangerous as hell,
so keep your eyes open.

997
00:53:44,110 --> 00:53:45,400
Lance, what's our ETA?

998
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:46,233
- [Lance] Five minutes, sir!

999
00:53:46,233 --> 00:53:47,066
- Roger that.

1000
00:53:48,739 --> 00:53:50,120
(dramatic music)

1001
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:52,780
- We have visual,
turning on approach, sir.

1002
00:54:06,247 --> 00:54:07,610
- Delta 29, this is Alpha 14,

1003
00:54:07,610 --> 00:54:10,310
circling the land at
northwest field, over.

1004
00:54:10,310 --> 00:54:11,823
- Roger that, Alpha 14.

1005
00:54:11,823 --> 00:54:16,147
Delta 29 ETA 40 seconds southeast sector.

1006
00:54:17,010 --> 00:54:18,630
See you on the ground.

1007
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:19,463
Lance?

1008
00:54:19,463 --> 00:54:20,296
- [Lance] Sir?

1009
00:54:20,296 --> 00:54:21,470
- Get us down on the southeast sector

1010
00:54:21,470 --> 00:54:22,940
soon as possible, ASAP.

1011
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:24,590
You got it?

1012
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:26,490
Alright, double check your gear, folks.

1013
00:54:26,490 --> 00:54:28,540
Make sure your weapon's pressure checked.

1014
00:54:32,390 --> 00:54:34,214
(helicopter whirring)

1015
00:54:34,214 --> 00:54:36,964
(dramatic music)

1016
00:54:46,248 --> 00:54:50,331
- Alright, move it out,
move it out, move it out!

1017
00:54:51,711 --> 00:54:53,360
Devinger, keep the engines running!

1018
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:54,213
- Yes, sir!

1019
00:55:02,727 --> 00:55:07,727
- Let's go!

1020
00:55:12,170 --> 00:55:13,323
- We got visitors!

1021
00:55:14,410 --> 00:55:15,243
- Visitors?

1022
00:55:15,243 --> 00:55:16,763
- The Marines, sir, they've landed.

1023
00:55:29,499 --> 00:55:30,416
- Oh, shit!

1024
00:55:33,938 --> 00:55:34,810
- [York] Are you employees here?

1025
00:55:34,810 --> 00:55:35,750
- Uh-huh.

1026
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:37,420
- This facility is now
under Marine control.

1027
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:39,880
We are escorting you out of
here for your own safety.

1028
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:42,390
Brady, take them to
evac and hold them there

1029
00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:43,770
until you turn them over
and then report back to me.

1030
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:44,770
- Let's go, move it.

1031
00:55:45,632 --> 00:55:46,549
- Let's go!

1032
00:55:50,030 --> 00:55:51,510
- Damn, that Vandamar!

1033
00:55:51,510 --> 00:55:52,560
- What do you want me to do, sir?

1034
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:53,670
- Nothing, not yet.

1035
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:55,830
The lasers will keep
them out of the basement.

1036
00:55:55,830 --> 00:55:57,610
- Yeah, but what if they
get past the lasers?

1037
00:55:57,610 --> 00:56:00,730
- Karen, nothing is more
important than our project!

1038
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:03,115
- Well, then, I'm gonna do something.

1039
00:56:03,115 --> 00:56:05,865
(dramatic music)

1040
00:56:21,842 --> 00:56:24,842
(suspenseful music)

1041
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:40,170
- Alpha 14, this is Delta 29.

1042
00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:41,800
We're good to go, over.

1043
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:43,410
- Delta 29, perimeter is secured.

1044
00:56:43,410 --> 00:56:44,790
We are moving in, over.

1045
00:56:44,790 --> 00:56:45,940
- Roger that, Alpha 14.

1046
00:56:47,188 --> 00:56:49,938
(dramatic music)

1047
00:56:54,070 --> 00:56:55,840
Lewis, take the six.

1048
00:57:09,208 --> 00:57:10,540
- [TJ] Are you sure this is gonna be okay?

1049
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:14,257
- TJ, I want the entire
power grid shut down now!

1050
00:57:14,257 --> 00:57:15,090
- [TJ] Whatever you say.

1051
00:57:15,090 --> 00:57:16,410
- Jim, we gotta get out of here now.

1052
00:57:16,410 --> 00:57:18,563
- Tell me something I don't know.

1053
00:57:18,563 --> 00:57:19,899
- No, you don't understand.

1054
00:57:19,899 --> 00:57:21,420
Hyde can't let us stay here.

1055
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:22,853
He's gonna turn them loose.

1056
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:26,150
- And that's gonna make us dinner, right?

1057
00:57:28,852 --> 00:57:31,602
(dramatic music)

1058
00:57:37,010 --> 00:57:38,543
- TJ, just do it now!

1059
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:42,483
- [TJ] Okay, here we go.

1060
00:57:44,914 --> 00:57:47,581
(alarm beeping)

1061
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,637
- Thank God for Henderson.

1062
00:57:55,964 --> 00:57:58,243
Come on, come on.

1063
00:57:58,243 --> 00:57:59,319
(dramatic music)

1064
00:57:59,319 --> 00:58:01,720
Stay with me, come on.

1065
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:03,137
- Karen, what's going on?

1066
00:58:03,137 --> 00:58:04,100
We've lost power all over the system!

1067
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:05,990
- Oh, my God, the laser
sword protectors not on.

1068
00:58:05,990 --> 00:58:07,380
They can get out of their training pen!

1069
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:10,928
- Check the tracking program,
the laptop's on batteries.

1070
00:58:10,928 --> 00:58:13,095
(roaring)

1071
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:19,100
- There are three loose already.

1072
00:58:21,590 --> 00:58:23,240
- Check it, check it, recheck it!

1073
00:58:24,075 --> 00:58:26,010
(dramatic music)

1074
00:58:26,010 --> 00:58:29,571
- Sir, when they called it
dark ops, they weren't kidding.

1075
00:58:29,571 --> 00:58:31,870
- Alpha 14, this is Delta 29.

1076
00:58:31,870 --> 00:58:32,703
We lost power.

1077
00:58:32,703 --> 00:58:34,226
What's your position, over?

1078
00:58:34,226 --> 00:58:36,920
- Delta 29, we are on level
three and we are dark, too.

1079
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:37,910
- Roger that, 14.

1080
00:58:37,910 --> 00:58:39,900
There's a backup generator on level four.

1081
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:41,120
Check it out, over.

1082
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:43,190
- Well, if there is, we'll
get the power back up.

1083
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:44,910
But if this is sabotage
we got another problem.

1084
00:58:44,910 --> 00:58:47,060
- Yeah, all the more
reason to keep going, 14.

1085
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:48,890
Now, check it out!
- Alright.

1086
00:58:48,890 --> 00:58:52,230
Reese, get your ass down to
level four and get us juiced up!

1087
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:53,063
- Yes, sir!

1088
00:58:54,368 --> 00:58:56,535
(roaring)

1089
00:59:01,748 --> 00:59:04,081
(exploding)

1090
00:59:05,490 --> 00:59:08,490
(suspenseful music)

1091
00:59:22,410 --> 00:59:24,380
- Lewis, where's this fucking elevator?

1092
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:26,510
- There's a connecting corridor up ahead.

1093
00:59:26,510 --> 00:59:27,880
- Alright, Benny, I want you to sweep

1094
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:29,870
this corridor all the
way down to the elevator.

1095
00:59:29,870 --> 00:59:31,710
Hold the elevator once
the power's back up.

1096
00:59:31,710 --> 00:59:33,010
You got it?
- Got it.

1097
00:59:33,010 --> 00:59:35,330
- Alright, we're gonna clear
the rest of this level.

1098
00:59:35,330 --> 00:59:37,125
Then we'll go down to the basement level.

1099
00:59:37,125 --> 00:59:38,720
That's where the target's probably housed.

1100
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,473
Alright, get moving.
- Yes, sir.

1101
00:59:41,730 --> 00:59:42,563
- Let's go.

1102
00:59:44,208 --> 00:59:46,875
(ominous music)

1103
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:53,720
- Doctor, we gotta warn those men!

1104
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:54,860
- No, Karen, no!

1105
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:55,693
They're trespassers!

1106
00:59:55,693 --> 00:59:57,440
They have no right to be
here in the first place!

1107
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,857
- They are human beings, for God's sake!

1108
00:59:59,857 --> 01:00:00,857
- Let it be!

1109
01:00:07,248 --> 01:00:10,248
(suspenseful music)

1110
01:00:17,965 --> 01:00:19,692
(growling)

1111
01:00:19,692 --> 01:00:20,692
- Holy shit!

1112
01:00:24,566 --> 01:00:27,649
(machine gun firing)

1113
01:00:28,502 --> 01:00:29,335
(roaring)
(screaming)

1114
01:00:29,335 --> 01:00:30,464
- What's that?

1115
01:00:30,464 --> 01:00:31,513
- Had to be Benbo.

1116
01:00:31,513 --> 01:00:33,023
- Benny, Benny?

1117
01:00:33,023 --> 01:00:35,951
(roaring)
(thudding)

1118
01:00:35,951 --> 01:00:39,118
(electricity zapping)

1119
01:00:40,168 --> 01:00:44,668
(roaring)
(screaming)

1120
01:00:46,539 --> 01:00:48,480
Back to the elevator, people!

1121
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:51,380
(growling)

1122
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:52,960
- What the fuck is that?

1123
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:56,233
- Down, Lewis. (gun clicking)

1124
01:00:56,233 --> 01:00:57,978
Shoot these motherfuckers!

1125
01:00:57,978 --> 01:01:00,478
(guns firing)

1126
01:01:04,912 --> 01:01:05,789
(growling)

1127
01:01:05,789 --> 01:01:07,627
Sladek, six o'clock!

1128
01:01:07,627 --> 01:01:10,127
(guns firing)

1129
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:27,280
- Are those what I think they are?

1130
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:29,970
- I don't wanna think
what I think those are.

1131
01:01:29,970 --> 01:01:32,014
- Yeah, they're fucking
dinosaurs, alright.

1132
01:01:32,014 --> 01:01:33,431
We have to find and
kill every one of them.

1133
01:01:33,431 --> 01:01:34,751
You got a problem with that, Sladek?

1134
01:01:34,751 --> 01:01:35,584
- No, sir.

1135
01:01:35,584 --> 01:01:36,417
- I didn't think so, let's go.

1136
01:01:36,417 --> 01:01:37,660
Keep your fucking eyes open!

1137
01:01:47,621 --> 01:01:49,482
- Okay, wait here.

1138
01:01:49,482 --> 01:01:50,315
- Bullshit!

1139
01:01:50,315 --> 01:01:51,853
You're gonna leave me here?

1140
01:01:51,853 --> 01:01:53,410
- You're gonna be safer
here in the stairwell.

1141
01:01:53,410 --> 01:01:54,470
I'll be right back.

1142
01:01:54,470 --> 01:01:55,303
Okay?

1143
01:01:55,303 --> 01:01:56,136
Stay here.

1144
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:05,220
- Why am I safer here?

1145
01:02:09,475 --> 01:02:11,642
(roaring)

1146
01:02:42,096 --> 01:02:44,429
(screaming)

1147
01:03:00,404 --> 01:03:03,300
(generators whirring)

1148
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:04,659
- Captain, got it.

1149
01:03:04,659 --> 01:03:05,492
- What took you so long?

1150
01:03:05,492 --> 01:03:06,600
Get your ass back here now.

1151
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:07,973
- Roger that, sir.

1152
01:03:07,973 --> 01:03:08,806
Asshole.

1153
01:03:08,806 --> 01:03:10,640
- That's Captain Asshole to you, son.

1154
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:13,160
Remember, I'm still your daddy.

1155
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:13,993
- Yes, sir.

1156
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:20,753
- Which?

1157
01:03:20,753 --> 01:03:22,457
- Up, up, up, up, up, up!

1158
01:03:25,330 --> 01:03:27,330
You think jabbing like that is gonna help?

1159
01:03:27,330 --> 01:03:28,430
- It's not gonna hurt.

1160
01:03:30,506 --> 01:03:31,759
(elevator dinging)

1161
01:03:31,759 --> 01:03:32,653
- There we go.

1162
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:35,580
- Delta 29, what's your status?

1163
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:37,627
- York, we've walked into
a real shit storm here

1164
01:03:37,627 --> 01:03:40,500
and I have lost a man and
I am not happy about it.

1165
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:41,560
Have you found Hyde?

1166
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:42,496
- Negative.

1167
01:03:42,496 --> 01:03:43,380
- Personally, I hope his ass got

1168
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:45,680
munched on by one of his little creations.

1169
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:46,513
Here's what we're gonna do.

1170
01:03:46,513 --> 01:03:47,800
I'm gonna simplify our mission.

1171
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:50,270
We're gonna blow this
facility and all its contents

1172
01:03:50,270 --> 01:03:52,260
and get the hell out of here, ASAP.

1173
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:53,780
We have enough C4 to blow
this place to kingdom come

1174
01:03:53,780 --> 01:03:55,970
and that is just what
the fuck we're gonna do.

1175
01:03:55,970 --> 01:03:57,530
Copy?
- That's an affirmative.

1176
01:03:57,530 --> 01:03:58,490
- Alright, get on it.

1177
01:03:58,490 --> 01:03:59,740
- Alright, Reese?
- Sir?

1178
01:03:59,740 --> 01:04:01,480
- Stay with me.
- Yes, sir!

1179
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:03,050
- Johnson, Sanders, get down to

1180
01:04:03,050 --> 01:04:04,840
the next level and plant some charges,

1181
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:06,990
then get ready to get
the hell out of here.

1182
01:04:08,684 --> 01:04:11,020
- Sladek, come here, come here, come here!

1183
01:04:11,020 --> 01:04:12,980
Take your satchel charge
down to the area down there

1184
01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:14,780
where I showed you where
that support beam is.

1185
01:04:14,780 --> 01:04:16,060
I want you to set it up down there, okay?

1186
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:17,800
And do me a favor, don't
blow yourself up, okay?

1187
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:19,130
Go, go.
- Why not?

1188
01:04:19,130 --> 01:04:20,447
Sladek's always first, right?

1189
01:04:20,447 --> 01:04:21,280
- Yeah, yeah, go ahead.

1190
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:22,405
Where's the blueprints?

1191
01:04:22,405 --> 01:04:23,693
Lewis, come over here,
goddamn it, stop fucking off!

1192
01:04:27,740 --> 01:04:29,320
Let's see, okay.

1193
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:30,660
How many charges you got left?

1194
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:31,493
- Six.

1195
01:04:31,493 --> 01:04:32,560
- Alright, great.

1196
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:36,752
- Well, I guess we won't
be needing this anymore.

1197
01:04:36,752 --> 01:04:38,919
(roaring)

1198
01:04:40,305 --> 01:04:42,555
(rumbling)

1199
01:04:44,830 --> 01:04:46,933
- My God, I've had enough of this.

1200
01:04:49,590 --> 01:04:50,440
- Push door open.

1201
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:57,610
- Damn it!

1202
01:04:57,610 --> 01:04:58,443
Where is McCoy?

1203
01:04:58,443 --> 01:04:59,840
If he'd gotten the power back on

1204
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:01,440
we could have saved some of them.

1205
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:03,020
- Your creatures, or the men?

1206
01:05:03,020 --> 01:05:04,310
- What is wrong with you, Karen?

1207
01:05:04,310 --> 01:05:07,000
- You murdered those men!

1208
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,240
And Lyle, he didn't quit, did he?

1209
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:11,340
- Lyle forgot why he was here.

1210
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:13,170
We're scientists, Karen.

1211
01:05:13,170 --> 01:05:16,620
We have to think about the
bigger picture, the greater good!

1212
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:18,130
- I know!

1213
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:20,330
The ends justify the means.

1214
01:05:20,330 --> 01:05:22,780
But I wanted to help people, not this!

1215
01:05:22,780 --> 01:05:24,030
- You can help me, Karen.

1216
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:26,203
I need you.

1217
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:28,683
- No, no!

1218
01:05:29,630 --> 01:05:31,448
Not anymore!

1219
01:05:31,448 --> 01:05:32,281
- Karen.

1220
01:05:32,281 --> 01:05:34,260
Karen we can continue!

1221
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:35,760
The Utah facility!

1222
01:05:37,186 --> 01:05:38,019
Fine.

1223
01:05:40,911 --> 01:05:42,411
I'll do it myself.

1224
01:05:43,479 --> 01:05:45,562
(crying)

1225
01:05:56,009 --> 01:05:58,259
(crashing)

1226
01:06:04,926 --> 01:06:06,009
- Oh, my God.

1227
01:06:06,967 --> 01:06:09,634
(ominous music)

1228
01:06:11,144 --> 01:06:13,311
(roaring)

1229
01:06:19,187 --> 01:06:21,437
(crashing)

1230
01:06:22,311 --> 01:06:24,644
(screaming)

1231
01:06:26,578 --> 01:06:28,828
(thudding)

1232
01:06:41,131 --> 01:06:43,881
(charge beeping)

1233
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:50,980
- Crow, this is Delta 29, over.

1234
01:06:50,980 --> 01:06:52,226
Crow, this is Delta 29.

1235
01:06:52,226 --> 01:06:53,110
Where the hell are you, over.

1236
01:06:53,110 --> 01:06:55,110
- This is Crow, go ahead Delta 29, over.

1237
01:06:55,110 --> 01:06:56,770
- We have scared employees moving at

1238
01:06:56,770 --> 01:06:58,690
a rapid pace to the front of the building.

1239
01:06:58,690 --> 01:07:00,780
I need you to get your
chopper in the air ASAP,

1240
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:02,820
rendezvous with us and meet in the front.

1241
01:07:02,820 --> 01:07:04,860
You are to, by any means necessary,

1242
01:07:04,860 --> 01:07:07,351
keep these employees from
leaving the premises, over.

1243
01:07:07,351 --> 01:07:09,024
- Roger that, over.

1244
01:07:09,024 --> 01:07:11,274
(whirring)

1245
01:07:15,397 --> 01:07:16,230
- Hey!

1246
01:07:17,166 --> 01:07:18,083
Wait, wait!

1247
01:07:20,711 --> 01:07:22,044
Hey, right here!

1248
01:07:23,672 --> 01:07:24,635
(growling)

1249
01:07:24,635 --> 01:07:26,968
(screaming)

1250
01:07:31,784 --> 01:07:34,409
- Devinger, what the
hell's happening up there?

1251
01:07:34,409 --> 01:07:36,163
(helicopter whining)

1252

(crunching)

1253
01:07:43,443 --> 01:07:44,823

(crashing)
(exploding)

1255
01:07:50,693 --> 01:07:52,060

1256
01:07:52,060 --> 01:07:52,893
- Yeah, Brady?

1257
01:07:52,893 --> 01:07:54,160
- We just lost the back up chopper.

1258
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:55,490
I don't know exactly what happened.

1259
01:07:55,490 --> 01:07:56,350
She just crashed!

1260
01:07:56,350 --> 01:07:58,500

1263
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:07,020

01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:08,880
evac chopper here right away, sir.

1265
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:09,890

- 20 minutes and we're out of here.

1267
01:08:11,980 --> 01:08:13,950

(suspenseful music)

1272
01:08:26,740 --> 01:08:27,573

1277
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:11,653

(roaring)

1279
01:09:14,869 --> 01:09:17,202

1280
01:09:18,130 --> 01:09:19,640
- Sanders is down!

1281
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:21,828

(gun firing)

1284
01:09:27,820 --> 01:09:28,653
- What's that?

1285
01:09:30,740 --> 01:09:32,640
- Sounds like gunshots to me.

1286
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:35,540
Spigot, why don't you
use your fucking brain?

1287
01:09:35,540 --> 01:09:37,489
- You're an asshole, Connolly!

1288
01:09:37,489 --> 01:09:38,523

1289
01:09:38,523 --> 01:09:39,356
(growling)

1290

(dramatic music)

1294
01:09:59,705 --> 01:10:01,550
- Captain, I don't know
where the hell I am!

1295
01:10:01,550 --> 01:10:03,200

(gun firing)
(roaring)

1297
01:10:07,962 --> 01:10:10,716
Johnson, get your ass

Johnson!

(growling)

1305
01:10:29,552 --> 01:10:30,646

(guns firing)

1307
01:10:34,398 --> 01:10:36,137

to investigate those noises.

1311
01:11:00,030 --> 01:11:00,863
- Me, sir?

1312
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:01,970
- No, Lewis, your fucking mother!

1313
01:11:01,970 --> 01:11:04,331
Now get out there before I
stick my foot in your ass!

1314
01:11:04,331 --> 01:11:05,164
- Shit!

1315
01:11:10,984 --> 01:11:11,817
(guns cocking)

1316
01:11:11,817 --> 01:11:13,483
- Ho, ho, ho, ho, we surrender.

1317
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:16,550
- Who the hell are you?

1318
01:11:16,550 --> 01:11:18,090
- Sheriff Tanner.

1319
01:11:18,090 --> 01:11:20,460
This is Barbara Phillips,
animal control officer.

1320
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:22,310
- Animal control officer?

1321
01:11:22,310 --> 01:11:24,076
Great job you're doing.

1322
01:11:24,076 --> 01:11:24,909

1323
01:11:24,909 --> 01:11:25,800
- We'll get you out of here, Sheriff,

1324
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:27,290
you and your lady friend.

1325
01:11:27,290 --> 01:11:28,150
I'd like to get you out now but

1326
01:11:28,150 --> 01:11:30,241
I can't afford the extra manpower.

1327
01:11:30,241 --> 01:11:31,074
- Thanks.
- Sounds good to me.

1328
01:11:31,074 --> 01:11:31,907
- Me, too.

1329
01:11:31,907 --> 01:11:33,272
- Well, that's good because that's

1330
01:11:33,272 --> 01:11:34,610
the only fucking option you got right now.

1331
01:11:34,610 --> 01:11:36,110
Where's your explosives?

1332
01:11:36,110 --> 01:11:37,760
Keep on watch over here, come on.

(thudding)

1338
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:20,673

1339
01:12:23,170 --> 01:12:24,003
- Breakfast?

1340
01:12:24,003 --> 01:12:25,958
- I don't think so. (gun cocking)

- We're good to go here.

1345
01:12:50,550 --> 01:12:52,060
Lewis, what's going on?

1346
01:12:52,060 --> 01:12:52,893
Talk to me guys!

1347
01:12:52,893 --> 01:12:54,650
What the fuck's going on?

(banging)
(roaring)

1349
01:12:57,486 --> 01:13:00,307
You all should get upstairs!

(screaming)

1365
01:14:13,452 --> 01:14:14,610
That son of a bitch.

(roaring)

1371
01:14:31,399 --> 01:14:33,020

1372
01:14:33,020 --> 01:14:34,490
Come on, Sheriff!

1373
01:14:34,490 --> 01:14:35,323
