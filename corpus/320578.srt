Yes, sir.

68

we've got a small system
in the southwest.

69
00:07:54,821 --> 00:07:57,221
Nothing too big.
Shouldn't be a big problem.

70
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:59,520
Some low ceilings
over San Francisco,
nothing major.

71
00:07:59,592 --> 00:08:01,890
That system finally
moved off to the east.

72
00:08:01,961 --> 00:08:03,485
And we've got clear skies.

73
00:08:03,563 --> 00:08:05,155
Good. It'll be a good day
on the East Coast.

74
00:08:05,231 --> 00:08:07,825
Yeah, what time is that fog
supposed to lift in the west?
Do you know?

75
00:08:07,901 --> 00:08:09,368
We're looking

76

No, don't send it to Kevin.
I'm so sorry...

105

194
00:13:48,441 --> 00:13:50,739

<i>11... 00 local time.</i>

195
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:51,936
It's a beautiful day
for flying,

196
00:13:52,011 --> 00:13:54,946
and our forecast across
the country is much
as you see it here.

197
00:13:55,014 --> 00:13:56,140
In just a few moments,

198
00:13:56,215 --> 00:14:00,276
our flight attendants will be
showing you a very important
safety demonstration.

199
00:14:00,353 --> 00:14:03,754
<i>Whether you are</i>
<i>a frequent flyer or</i>

<i>Thank you, and welcome aboard.</i>

203
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:11,958
United 93, ops.

204
00:14:12,031 --> 00:14:13,498
Tail north.
Then clear to push.

205
00:14:14,233 --> 00:14:15,325
DAHL: <i>Okay. Tail north.</i>

206
00:14:15,401 --> 00:14:17,926
Clear to push us. Start.
Okay, tail north.

207
00:14:18,004 --> 00:14:19,665
Brakes released.
Cleared to push.

208
00:14:39,392 --> 00:14:40,450
Yeah, good morning.

209
00:14:40,526 --> 00:14:43,290
This is Rich Sullivan
with the 11:15 strategic
planning telcon.

210
00:14:43,362 --> 00:14:45,455
We're updating
advisory number 23.

211
00:14:45,531 --> 00:14:49,262
First issue, we're showing
15-minute departure delays
out of Newark.

212
00:14:49,335 --> 00:14:50,324
Give us an update there.

213
00:14:50,403 --> 00:14:51,461
I just spoke to Pete.

214
00:14:51,537 --> 00:14:53,562
They're gonna try and get
those reduced
or eliminated.

215
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:55,436
They're gonna get Washington
to reduce their restrictions,

216
00:14:55,508 --> 00:14:57,499
so probably it'll clear up
in about a half hour or so.

217
00:14:57,577 --> 00:15:01,138
Okay, we're gonna lessen the
restrictions or eliminate them
on the Newark departures.

218
00:15:01,214 --> 00:15:04,012
And the departure delays
should be coming down
here very soon.

219
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:08,213
Next, we got a large-scale
military exercise
off the East Coast today.

220
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:11,222
All the offshore routes
are gonna be closed at 1400.

221
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:14,623
All the traffic will have to
be moved inland.
Any questions on that?

222
00:15:14,694 --> 00:15:18,391
<i>This is JetBlue.</i>
<i>Is Amber 761</i>
<i>available for offloads today?</i>

223
00:15:18,864 --> 00:15:20,024
Don't go for it.

224
00:15:20,099 --> 00:15:21,726
No exceptions.
They're gonna have to wait.

225
00:15:21,801 --> 00:15:22,825
No exceptions.

226
00:15:22,902 --> 00:15:24,426
All the offshore routes
are gonna be closed.

227
00:15:24,503 --> 00:15:26,198
Everyone's gonna be
moved inland. And that's it.

228
00:15:26,272 --> 00:15:29,173
Anybody have anything else
for the morning plan?

229
00:15:29,242 --> 00:15:31,176
Okay, we'll do
the next telcon at 1315.

230
00:15:31,244 --> 00:15:32,233

Do me a favor,
you got that United 175
out there.

267
00:17:35,134 --> 00:17:38,501
Can you have them take a look
and see if you can get
a visual on American 11?

268
00:17:38,571 --> 00:17:39,799

269
00:17:40,306 --> 00:17:44,174

about 15 miles.

00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:50,881
He's tracking
south-southwestbound.
Altitude's unknown.

00:18:15,174 --> 00:18:16,971
Hey, John! Come here!

280
00:18:19,645 --> 00:18:21,203

Aircraft, call in Boston.
Say again, please.

282
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:26,816
This guy here
just contacted me.
I heard some verbiage

283
00:18:26,886 --> 00:18:30,652
over the background.
It was not American,
it was foreign.

284
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:33,215
They said something about
taking over the cockpit,

285
00:18:33,292 --> 00:18:35,192
"Stay calm,
we're going back
to the airport."

286
00:18:35,261 --> 00:18:38,162
I have no idea who it was.
I think we have
a hijack situation here.

287
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,322
What makes you think
that's a hijacker?

288
00:18:39,398 --> 00:18:40,422
Just trust me.

289
00:18:40,499 --> 00:18:42,160
I heard the guy
in my ear, okay?

290
00:18:42,234 --> 00:18:43,531
I heard the guy in my ear.
All right.

291
00:18:43,602 --> 00:18:45,467
You need to check it out.

292
00:18:45,538 --> 00:18:47,335
Command Center East. Tony.

293
00:18:47,406 --> 00:18:49,533
Hey, Ben, we're doing
a coffee run.
You want some coffee?

294
00:18:49,608 --> 00:18:51,075
No, I'm filled up with coffee.

295
00:18:51,143 --> 00:18:53,304
How are they doing
on those restrictions
out of New York, Al?

296
00:18:53,379 --> 00:18:56,746
Tell them they got them
reduced. So La Guardia,
in fact, is now out of delays.

297
00:18:56,816 --> 00:18:58,044
Newark's gonna
stay a while, though.

298
00:18:58,117 --> 00:18:59,778
Good job. Good job. Excellent.

299
00:18:59,852 --> 00:19:01,183
Excellent.

300
00:19:01,554 --> 00:19:03,522
Rich, you need
to monitor this.

301
00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:10,028
Yeah, let me take this stuff.
I got to get
to the 8:30, so...

302
00:19:10,095 --> 00:19:11,722
Command Center East. Toby.

303
00:19:11,797 --> 00:19:13,162
Hey, Walsh.

304
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:19,028
Hey, Ben!
Ben, hang on.

305
00:19:19,104 --> 00:19:20,162
Yes?

306
00:19:21,073 --> 00:19:23,940
Listen, we're just getting
a preliminary report
from Boston Center.

307
00:19:24,009 --> 00:19:25,408
They think they've
got a hijacking.

308
00:19:25,478 --> 00:19:26,570
A hijacking?

309
00:19:26,645 --> 00:19:29,443
It's American 11.
A heavy 767.

310
00:19:29,515 --> 00:19:30,539
Departed Boston for LA.

311
00:19:30,616 --> 00:19:31,708
Where is he now?

312
00:19:31,784 --> 00:19:33,445
He's about 50, 60 west
of Boston.

313
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:34,850
You got a squawk 7500?

314
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,944
No, I don't think so.

315
00:19:36,021 --> 00:19:37,488
They heard some kind
of suspicious transmission,

316
00:19:37,556 --> 00:19:38,716
so they're checking
on it...
All right.

317
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:39,815
It's very preliminary.
All right.

318
00:19:39,892 --> 00:19:43,259
When you get some
hard information, let me know
and I'll brief the staff.

319
00:19:43,329 --> 00:19:44,523
Thanks.

320
00:19:44,597 --> 00:19:45,586
Did someone say "hijack"?

321
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:48,959
Everything okay?
Yeah.

322
00:19:49,034 --> 00:19:50,262
Good.
Before we
get started...

323
00:19:50,336 --> 00:19:52,964
Well, that was
a possible hijack. American...
What?

324
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:54,027
Yeah.
Hijack?

325
00:19:54,106 --> 00:19:55,471
Anybody remember...
Haven't seen that in years.

326
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:57,031
Yeah, I know.
When was the last time
we had a hijack?

327
00:19:57,109 --> 00:19:59,202
It's been quite a while,
quite a while.
'91, '90.

328
00:19:59,278 --> 00:20:01,678
I can't even
remember precisely.
Yeah, I know.

329
00:20:01,747 --> 00:20:04,477
No, no.
It's Boston to LAX,
American 11.

330
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:06,484
Yeah, they're on it
and they're gonna
keep me informed.

331
00:20:06,552 --> 00:20:08,076
I'll brief you.
Okay.

332
00:20:09,421 --> 00:20:11,389
HOMER: <i>Hey, ground. United 93.</i>
<i>What's our sequence?</i>

333
00:20:11,457 --> 00:20:14,324
United 93, follow
the Continental and Delta.

334
00:20:14,393 --> 00:20:17,055
You're number 15
for the departure.
Monitor tower.

335

CALLAHAN: <i>Air Canada 273,</i>
<i>turn left...</i>

336
00:20:29,308 --> 00:20:31,299
Well, folks, from
the flight deck, Captain Dahl.

337
00:20:31,377 --> 00:20:33,538
Looks like we've run into
a little bit
of rush hour traffic

338
00:20:33,612 --> 00:20:36,080
<i>here at Newark this morning,</i>
<i>and that's a typical day</i>
<i>at Newark.</i>

339
00:20:36,148 --> 00:20:38,309
<i>I count 15 airplanes</i>
<i>ahead of us for departure,</i>

340
00:20:38,384 --> 00:20:40,443
<i>and they're getting them off</i>
<i>about one every two minutes,</i>

341
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:42,714
<i>so unfortunately it's gonna be</i>
<i>about a 30-minute delay</i>

342
00:20:42,788 --> 00:20:43,982
<i>until we get airborne.</i>

343
00:20:44,056 --> 00:20:46,490
I apologize for the delay
and I appreciate
your patience,

344
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,686
and I'll get back to you
with an update. Thank you.

345
00:20:48,761 --> 00:20:49,750
Yes?

346
00:20:49,828 --> 00:20:50,886
Is everything okay?

347
00:20:50,963 --> 00:20:54,455
Yeah, it's just fine.
Just a normal delay
out of Newark.

348
00:20:54,533 --> 00:20:57,058
Excuse me,
can I have a pillow
and a blanket, please?

349
00:21:01,206 --> 00:21:02,867
What did you say?

350
00:21:06,979 --> 00:21:08,742
ZALEWSKl: Guys, just
keep your planes
away from him, man.

351
00:21:08,814 --> 00:21:10,338
I have no idea
what this guy's doing.

352
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:11,440
What do we have, Pete?

353
00:21:11,517 --> 00:21:13,781
I gave all my aircraft
over to Greg already.

354
00:21:13,852 --> 00:21:15,319
He's working them.
I'm holding onto this.

355
00:21:15,387 --> 00:21:17,014
This guy right here
is the only guy I have.

356
00:21:17,089 --> 00:21:19,387
He's westbound right now.
I heard some
voices in my ears.

357
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:21,323
Flight 11,
American Airlines?
But no 7500 code?

358
00:21:21,393 --> 00:21:23,725
No, I had no 7500 code.
Nothing.

359
00:21:25,664 --> 00:21:29,293
American 11, Boston Center.
American 11, how do you hear?

360
00:21:29,368 --> 00:21:31,495
No, see, that
doesn't make sense.

361
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,501
What's up, Pete?
Where are we at?

362
00:21:36,575 --> 00:21:37,872
I just put it up
into the speaker here,

363
00:21:37,943 --> 00:21:40,707
if we hear anything back,
but right now we
just have the guy.

364
00:21:40,779 --> 00:21:42,872
He's due westbound.
He's climbing...

365
00:21:42,948 --> 00:21:44,848
ATTA: <i>I'm going</i>
<i>back to the airport.</i>
That's it.

366
00:21:44,917 --> 00:21:46,009
That's it right here.

367
00:21:46,085 --> 00:21:48,315
Somebody's got to pull
these fucking tapes right now.

368
00:21:48,387 --> 00:21:50,321
Pull the tapes
now from 0800 on.

Okay, and remember
this is a NORAD exercise.

373
00:22:14,713 --> 00:22:17,944
Right now we have
Russian Bears penetrating
the ADIZ up off Alaska,

374
00:22:18,017 --> 00:22:20,485
so you'll want your
tracker techs keeping
their eyes open.

375
00:22:20,552 --> 00:22:23,350

what Powell's

00:22:33,098 --> 00:22:34,360
Yes, sir.

379
00:22:37,936 --> 00:22:38,960
Powell,
what do you got?

380
00:22:39,038 --> 00:22:41,302
Hey, I got a hijack
on the phone. Boston.

381
00:22:41,373 --> 00:22:42,397
Is this a sim?

382
00:22:42,474 --> 00:22:44,169
No, real world.
Come on, where's EET?

383
00:22:44,243 --> 00:22:45,835
No, it's a no-shit hijack.
It's Boston.

384
00:22:45,911 --> 00:22:46,900
Serious?

385
00:22:46,979 --> 00:22:48,606
Yes.
All right.

386
00:22:53,619 --> 00:22:55,109
Okay, thanks.

387
00:23:00,592 --> 00:23:02,184
Well, okay,
give them a call.

388
00:23:02,261 --> 00:23:03,592
Yeah, we have
a possible hijack.

389
00:23:03,662 --> 00:23:06,460
General update.
Tell them we're ready here.
Okay?

390
00:23:06,532 --> 00:23:07,590
Can do, sir.

391
00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:09,065
Sir?
Yeah.

392
00:23:09,134 --> 00:23:11,364
We have a real world
situation here.

393
00:23:11,437 --> 00:23:13,928
We have
American Airlines
flight 11.

394
00:23:14,006 --> 00:23:17,703
It's a 757 out
of Boston to LAX.

395
00:23:18,243 --> 00:23:21,872
Ninety-two passengers on it,
and it's at 7500.

396
00:23:21,947 --> 00:23:23,346
Still squawking?
No, sir.

403
00:24:07,292 --> 00:24:08,850
Folks, Captain Dahl
again with an update.

404
00:24:08,927 --> 00:24:10,417
We're making
some progress now.

405
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:12,191
We're about number four
for departure.

406

your order for breakfast
after take-off.

408
00:24:17,536 --> 00:24:19,128
You're gonna get it.
We have a hot breakfast,

409
00:24:19,204 --> 00:24:21,035
which is, like,
an omelet, roll and fruit.

410
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,505
I'll take that. Thanks very much.

411
00:24:22,574 --> 00:24:24,007
Okay, great.

412
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:27,870
I'm sorry for the delay.
We'll be out of here
as soon as we can.

413
00:24:27,946 --> 00:24:29,208
I understand. Thank you.

414
00:24:29,281 --> 00:24:32,273
Would you mind
bringing me some water
with my breakfast?

415
00:24:32,351 --> 00:24:33,716
I have to take some pills.

416
00:24:33,786 --> 00:24:35,344
Sure. No worries.

417
00:24:35,888 --> 00:24:38,618
I'd just as soon stay out
of the more populated areas.

418
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:39,816
Well, here are the falls.

419
00:24:39,892 --> 00:24:43,521
If we go up there, we'll be
all right. I'd like to get up
in that high country.

421
00:24:53,205 --> 00:24:54,331
Go ahead, sir.

MARR: <i>Good morning, Major.</i>

423
00:24:55,908 --> 00:25:00,345
We got a possible hijack
in progress out of Boston.

424
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:05,573
<i>American Airlines 757.</i>
<i>They're not squawking.</i>
<i>Let's find them.</i>

425
00:25:05,684 --> 00:25:07,049
Copy that.

426
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,283
All right, let's go.
Listen up, everybody!

427
00:25:11,356 --> 00:25:14,257
All right, look,
we got a possible hijack.

428
00:25:14,726 --> 00:25:17,786
This is real world.
Possible hijack.

429
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:20,391
Surveillance,
get your tracking techs
on scopes.

430
00:25:20,465 --> 00:25:22,126
I want two on a scope.
Copy that.

431
00:25:22,201 --> 00:25:23,964
I wanna know
if he pops up again.

432
00:25:24,036 --> 00:25:28,439
ID, get on the phones
with the FAA. Let's get
his last known position.

433
00:25:28,774 --> 00:25:30,298
Copy.
Weapons.

434
00:25:31,143 --> 00:25:33,008
Otis to battle stations.
Copy that.

435
00:25:33,078 --> 00:25:35,603
Do you have
a call sign or anything?
Battle stations. Copy.

436
00:25:35,681 --> 00:25:36,807
American Airlines 11.

437
00:25:36,882 --> 00:25:39,316
American Airlines 11
is the call sign.

438
00:25:39,518 --> 00:25:41,281
Sir, it's confirmed.

439
00:25:43,889 --> 00:25:45,015
And now
the aircraft is NORDO.

440
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:46,079
We get a lot of that crap.

441
00:25:46,258 --> 00:25:48,818
Somebody's making
phony transmissions
on the radio...

442
00:25:48,894 --> 00:25:52,728
If it's not confirmed,
it's probably a
lost radio call or something.

443
00:25:53,699 --> 00:25:55,496
Command Center. Tony.

444
00:25:56,802 --> 00:25:58,030
Stand by one second.

445
00:25:58,103 --> 00:26:00,435
Yesterday, we had
two ground delay programs.

446
00:26:00,505 --> 00:26:03,338
One at Atlanta
and one at O'Hare.

447
00:26:03,442 --> 00:26:06,240
And we had 850
aircraft delayed.

448
00:26:06,879 --> 00:26:08,608
Hit a 56-minute average

449
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:13,174
and a very modest
47,600 delay minutes.

450
00:26:13,418 --> 00:26:16,285
Benny, that is like,
$2,000 a minute
we are talking about.

451
00:26:16,355 --> 00:26:17,947
You are into
a hole already for...

452
00:26:18,023 --> 00:26:20,287
No, no, no.
...90 million bucks, Ben.

453
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:23,021
They're not even my delays.
I started today.

454
00:26:23,095 --> 00:26:24,323
Ben, we need you
on the floor.

455
00:26:24,396 --> 00:26:26,057
We're getting more information
on that American 11.

456
00:26:26,131 --> 00:26:28,429
Oh, all right. Listen,
excuse me, John...
Yeah.

457
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,092
...and, folks,
I'm gonna go out
and take care of this.

458
00:26:30,168 --> 00:26:31,567
We're getting
some more updates
Okay.

459
00:26:31,637 --> 00:26:33,764
And I'll brief you
as soon as I
get some more information.

460
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:35,204
What do you got?

461
00:26:35,274 --> 00:26:37,003
American Airlines
contacted Boston Center.

462
00:26:37,075 --> 00:26:39,771
Apparently, a flight attendant
onboard the aircraft

463
00:26:39,845 --> 00:26:43,337
via telephone
called the company
and she said that

464
00:26:43,415 --> 00:26:47,181
the aircraft is being hijacked
and one or more people
have been stabbed.

465
00:26:47,252 --> 00:26:48,378
Stabbed on the plane?

466
00:26:48,453 --> 00:26:49,681
Yeah. Just confirm...

467
00:26:49,755 --> 00:26:52,883
American Airlines gave this
information to Boston
who called us.

468
00:26:52,958 --> 00:26:55,290
Is the aircraft
still on course?
The last I heard.

469
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,918
Let's get an update
from Tony.
All right.

470
00:26:56,995 --> 00:26:58,019
All right, stand by.

471
00:26:58,096 --> 00:26:59,120
This is Boston
on the line right now.
Yeah.

472
00:26:59,197 --> 00:27:00,425
They don't know anything more.

473
00:27:00,499 --> 00:27:03,730
There was
a suspicious transmission,
the controller heard it,

474
00:27:03,802 --> 00:27:06,965
and they're pulling tapes
to see exactly what was said
on the frequency.

475
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,904
And American Airlines
is the one that called them.

476
00:27:08,974 --> 00:27:11,101
Who is it?
The ops manager
of Boston Center.

477
00:27:11,176 --> 00:27:12,404
Hi, this is Ben Sliney.

478
00:27:12,477 --> 00:27:14,604
Boston thought
it may have been a...
They heard

479
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,705
some kind of oddball Yes.
Transmission.

480
00:27:16,782 --> 00:27:18,010
Right.
So she called the company,

481
00:27:18,083 --> 00:27:19,948
she said their airplane
was being hijacked...

482
00:27:20,018 --> 00:27:21,417
All right.
Has he changed altitude?

483
00:27:21,486 --> 00:27:24,011
...don't know if it's
a person or people
who've been stabbed.

484
00:27:24,089 --> 00:27:25,420
All right.

485
00:27:27,225 --> 00:27:29,420
All right,
we're pulling it up now,
and, listen,

486
00:27:29,494 --> 00:27:33,624
if you get any further
information on the track
or the altitude, let me know.

487
00:27:34,866 --> 00:27:38,029
All right. Keep me advised.
Thanks. Yeah. Thanks.

488
00:27:38,236 --> 00:27:39,396
All right, look, the...

489
00:27:39,471 --> 00:27:42,338
That aircraft has made
a turn southbound

490
00:27:42,407 --> 00:27:44,432
and they're not
tracking him any longer.

491
00:27:44,509 --> 00:27:47,239
They're not getting
any Mode C altitude
information.

492
00:27:47,312 --> 00:27:51,180
And I see our track has
gone ghost on it, but they do
say he's heading southbound.

493
00:27:51,249 --> 00:27:53,945
I want us to get in touch
with New York Center

494
00:27:54,019 --> 00:27:56,715
and let them know he's coming.
Let's get everything
out of its way

495
00:27:56,788 --> 00:27:58,312
and even give
New York TRACON a call

496
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:00,881
because he may be trying
to head for one of the
New York airports.

497
00:28:00,959 --> 00:28:02,051
Okay, right.

498
00:28:02,127 --> 00:28:03,594
Information's
that American 11...

499
00:28:03,662 --> 00:28:05,357
Maybe we should
get in touch
with headquarters

500
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:07,421
and start briefing
them on this now.
Yeah, I'll call immediately.

501
00:28:07,499 --> 00:28:08,523
Thanks.

502
00:28:15,107 --> 00:28:17,041
Folks, Captain Dahl
with some good news.

503
00:28:17,109 --> 00:28:18,542
We're currently
number one for departure.

504
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:20,009
<i>We'll be airborne shortly.</i>

505
00:28:20,078 --> 00:28:23,138
<i>Flight attendants,</i>
<i>prepare for take-off, please.</i>

506
00:28:23,915 --> 00:28:26,748
You know, I try and drop
as many trips as I can.

507
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:30,044
I like to be home
with my babies.
Yeah.

508
00:28:30,122 --> 00:28:31,214
Yeah.

509
00:28:31,289 --> 00:28:33,723
Did you bring some
good magazines
to keep yourself awake?

510
00:28:33,792 --> 00:28:34,781
(LAUGHING)

511
00:28:34,893 --> 00:28:38,454
I don't think I've gotten
through a magazine
in I can't tell you how long.

512
00:28:43,502 --> 00:28:46,767
ATTA: <i>We have some planes.</i>
<i>Just stay quiet</i>
<i>and you'll be okay.</i>

513
00:28:46,838 --> 00:28:49,136
<i>We are returning</i>
<i>to the airport.</i>

514
00:28:53,812 --> 00:28:57,213
<i>We have some planes.</i>
<i>Just stay quiet</i>
<i>and you'll be okay.</i>

515
00:28:57,282 --> 00:28:59,273
<i>We are returning</i>
<i>to the airport.</i>

516
00:29:13,465 --> 00:29:14,454
<i>Planes.</i>

517
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,534
<i>We have some planes.</i>

518
00:29:24,242 --> 00:29:28,178
Yeah, it's Bob here.
It's "planes."
Planes. Plural.

519
00:29:28,246 --> 00:29:29,406
Definitely, yeah.

520
00:29:37,589 --> 00:29:39,887
United 93, wind 050 at 6.

521
00:29:39,958 --> 00:29:42,586
Runway four-left.
Clear for take-off.

522
00:29:43,195 --> 00:29:46,926

Clear for take off.
Four-left. United 93.

523
00:29:46,998 --> 00:29:49,466
010, 5,000. Here we go.

524
00:31:05,076 --> 00:31:08,136
Welcome to New York Center.
Altimeter is 2996.

525
00:31:08,213 --> 00:31:09,805
Maintain speed 310...

526
00:31:09,881 --> 00:31:11,109
...speed of 300 knots
or greater.

527
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:16,314
Maintain flight level 220
and maintain
a speed of 300 knots.

528
00:31:17,923 --> 00:31:19,322
Roger, you got it.

529
00:31:22,494 --> 00:31:23,961
New York. Thumbser.

530
00:31:25,297 --> 00:31:26,764
Yeah, Boston.

531
00:31:31,203 --> 00:31:33,763
New York. United 175.

532
00:31:41,112 --> 00:31:43,945
All right, thank you.
I got it. All right.

533
00:31:46,918 --> 00:31:48,476
Hey, Dave?
Yeah?

534
00:31:48,553 --> 00:31:50,316
American 11 looking
as a possible hijacking.

535
00:31:50,388 --> 00:31:51,878
It may be going
back into Kennedy.
Hijack?

536
00:31:51,957 --> 00:31:52,981
They say they heard something,

537
00:31:53,058 --> 00:31:54,616
that there might be intrusion
into the cockpit.

538
00:31:54,693 --> 00:31:55,887
All right, just let me know
if you hear anything,

539
00:31:55,961 --> 00:31:57,189
anything unusual
or anything.
I'll watch him.

540
00:31:57,262 --> 00:31:58,695
He's not squawking 7500.

541
00:31:58,763 --> 00:32:00,196
So just keep it normal.
No, he's not doing anything.

542
00:32:00,265 --> 00:32:01,323
I'll keep an eye on him.
I got it.

543
00:32:01,399 --> 00:32:03,196
Just keep
an eye on him.
Will do.

544
00:32:04,135 --> 00:32:06,729
What's going on?
We got a hijack.

545
00:32:06,805 --> 00:32:09,103
It might be a hijack,
I don't know.
It's American 11.

546
00:32:09,174 --> 00:32:10,436
It's going down.
You got a hijack?

547
00:32:10,508 --> 00:32:12,100
We haven't had
a hijack in 20 years.
I don't know.

548
00:32:12,177 --> 00:32:13,804
Listen, I don't know.
What do you want
me to tell you?

549
00:32:13,878 --> 00:32:16,403
I just gotta watch him.
That's all.

550
00:32:16,481 --> 00:32:18,779
Chris,
you got that?
Thumbser.

551
00:32:20,185 --> 00:32:21,846
United 175 heavy,
New York, go ahead.

552
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:26,448
...west of Kennedy by 15
southbound descending,
it's American 11.

553
00:32:26,524 --> 00:32:28,890
We're not sure
what the problem is yet.

554
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,928
Possible
hijacking, we're not sure.

555
00:32:32,831 --> 00:32:34,765
Passenger said something
about they're up front.

556
00:32:34,833 --> 00:32:37,267
Roger, United 175 heavy.
Well, I'll pass it along.

557
00:32:37,335 --> 00:32:38,359
Wait, I'll talk to him.
Paul!

558
00:32:38,436 --> 00:32:39,425
Hold on.
Paul,

559
00:32:39,504 --> 00:32:40,732
United 175 heavy just called.

560
00:32:40,805 --> 00:32:42,966
He said he heard
a suspicious transmission
on the radio

561
00:32:43,041 --> 00:32:44,303
as he was climbing
out of Logan.

562
00:32:44,376 --> 00:32:47,937
He said something about,
"Everybody stay
in your seats."

563
00:32:48,013 --> 00:32:49,981
He doesn't know
who it came from,
but it came out

564
00:32:50,048 --> 00:32:51,481
and he said it was...

565
00:32:51,549 --> 00:32:53,676
He just heard it as
he was climbing out...
United 175?

566
00:32:53,752 --> 00:32:55,379
United 175 heavy, yes.

567
00:32:55,453 --> 00:32:57,751
And what about American 11?
American 11's still...
It's nothing.

568
00:32:57,822 --> 00:32:59,380
He's just still
going slow, you know.

569
00:32:59,457 --> 00:33:01,687
He might be going into Newark
or Kennedy or something,

570
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,092
I don't know.
You know, I have no idea.

571
00:33:11,836 --> 00:33:14,930
CALLAHAN: <i>Continental 1002,</i>
<i>Newark Tower. Good morning.</i>

572
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:20,775
Why don't you try
the next one down?

573
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:23,138
An arctic fish.
How about "char"?

574
00:33:27,252 --> 00:33:28,583
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>Captain Dahl.</i>

575
00:33:28,653 --> 00:33:30,917
As we make this turn,
those of you on the left side
of the airplane

576
00:33:30,989 --> 00:33:34,584
<i>have a beautiful view</i>
<i>of lower Manhattan and</i>
<i>the New York City skyline.</i>

577
00:33:34,659 --> 00:33:36,251
Looks nice out there.
Huh?

578
00:33:36,328 --> 00:33:38,125
Looks nice out there.

579
00:33:47,172 --> 00:33:50,266
What do you mean
there's no one there? Well,
you guys must have a backup.

580
00:33:50,342 --> 00:33:52,810
Whatever information they got,
they got to give it to us
right away.

581
00:33:52,877 --> 00:33:53,969
All right, good.

582
00:33:54,045 --> 00:33:56,673
Hijack controller,
no one at the desk.
No backup.

583
00:33:56,748 --> 00:33:58,272
Looks like
they're on vacation.
No backup?

584
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:59,783
There's no backup.
There's no one at the desk.

585
00:33:59,851 --> 00:34:02,046
Who were you
talking to downstairs?

586
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,644
I'm talking to this guy.

587
00:34:03,722 --> 00:34:06,384
He's in the conference room.
There's nobody else in there.

588
00:34:06,458 --> 00:34:08,517
I'm relaying the information,
and then he's moving...

589
00:34:08,593 --> 00:34:12,085
We got it. We got the tapes.
Boston Center
got the tapes pulled.

590
00:34:12,163 --> 00:34:14,222
They said,
"We have some planes."
Hold on.

591
00:34:14,299 --> 00:34:16,130
That's what he said,
"We have some planes."

592
00:34:16,201 --> 00:34:17,828
That was the
suspicious transmission.

593
00:34:17,902 --> 00:34:19,369
Was there
any voice recognition?

594
00:34:19,437 --> 00:34:21,064
MAN: I'm tracking it.

595
00:34:21,172 --> 00:34:22,639
SLINEY: Jesus Christ.

596
00:34:24,809 --> 00:34:27,607
Med Express 77,
maintain 10,000.

597
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,146
The Kennedy altimeter's 2996.

598
00:34:29,214 --> 00:34:30,579
Keep an eye on it. Now watch.

599
00:34:30,915 --> 00:34:33,748
Delta 351, altimeter 2992.

600
00:34:33,818 --> 00:34:36,048
Chilean 4369,
New York altimeter, 2996.

601
00:34:36,121 --> 00:34:37,884
Paul,
what do you got?
Hey, Mike, how you doing?

602
00:34:37,956 --> 00:34:41,722
American 11.
Possible hijacking
on American 11.

603
00:34:41,793 --> 00:34:44,921
He's southbound, 767.
Nobody's talking to him.

604
00:34:44,996 --> 00:34:47,590
I just called the room up
and let them know about it.

605
00:34:47,665 --> 00:34:49,394
They're not tracking
him either, right now.

606
00:34:49,467 --> 00:34:50,832
Where was
the target last time?

607
00:34:50,902 --> 00:34:52,927
Last time it was tracked
in New York at Kennedy.

608
00:34:53,004 --> 00:34:54,995
He's heading for the south.
American 11, New York.

609
00:34:55,073 --> 00:34:56,199
What do you want me to check?

610
00:35:01,179 --> 00:35:02,703
Target's gone.

611
00:35:03,248 --> 00:35:06,649
Paul. Paul,
the target for
American 11 just disappeared.

612
00:35:06,718 --> 00:35:09,084
Just disappeared where?
Right around Manhattan.

613
00:35:09,154 --> 00:35:10,246
It just disappeared?

614
00:35:10,321 --> 00:35:11,310
It was right there.
It just disappeared.

615
00:35:11,389 --> 00:35:13,789
I was talking to
the other aircraft.
The target just disappeared.

616
00:35:13,858 --> 00:35:17,055
Call Kennedy up. Find out
if they have it. We don't know
where American is, all right?

617
00:35:17,128 --> 00:35:19,028
Call Kennedy tower up,
see if they have him
down there,

618
00:35:19,097 --> 00:35:20,792
and call Newark tower
and see if they have
him there.

619
00:35:20,865 --> 00:35:21,456
Okay.

620
00:35:23,802 --> 00:35:25,394
What do we got, boys?
Anything?

621
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:27,734
All right, sir, you need me
to go ahead and start
a recall for you?

622
00:35:27,806 --> 00:35:28,864
Yes, initiate that.

623
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,202
Okay, great.

624
00:35:30,275 --> 00:35:33,267
What's the status with Otis?
Are those planes ready?

625
00:35:33,344 --> 00:35:35,312
Foxy, what you got?
You got anything?

626
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:38,008
MCC, battle stations
call made 0838.

627
00:35:38,082 --> 00:35:40,676
Otis attained
battle stations at 40.

628
00:35:40,752 --> 00:35:43,550
08? Colonel, 0840,

629
00:35:43,621 --> 00:35:45,646
slams at battle stations.

630
00:35:45,723 --> 00:35:47,953
Otis at battle stations. Copy.

631
00:35:48,393 --> 00:35:50,725
NASYPANY: <i>Get me something.</i>
<i>Nothing's squawking.</i>

632
00:35:50,795 --> 00:35:53,696
MCC, Boston lost American 11.

633
00:35:53,765 --> 00:35:55,426
They don't see him anymore
on their scopes.

634
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,866
They think maybe he went
below radar coverage.

635
00:35:57,936 --> 00:35:59,426
They have no idea where he is.

636
00:35:59,504 --> 00:36:02,098
We've got Otis.
Have the battle ready.

637
00:36:02,173 --> 00:36:04,334
We need scramble authority.

638
00:36:04,409 --> 00:36:05,603
MAN: <i>Copy that.</i>

639
00:36:05,677 --> 00:36:08,441
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.

640
00:36:09,147 --> 00:36:10,171
Copy that.

641
00:36:10,248 --> 00:36:12,546
<i>Okay, let's get those</i>
<i>Otis birds in the air!</i>

642
00:36:12,617 --> 00:36:14,084
Scramble Otis!

643
00:36:14,152 --> 00:36:16,814
This is Huntress
with an active air defense
scramble.

644
00:36:16,888 --> 00:36:18,822
<i>I repeat, active</i>
<i>air defense scramble.</i>

645
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:21,620
<i>Time is 0846.</i>

646
00:36:21,926 --> 00:36:25,191
<i>I authenticate</i>
<i>November-November.</i>

647
00:36:28,233 --> 00:36:30,258
Greg, look at the
World Trade Center.
What?

648
00:36:30,335 --> 00:36:33,998
Look at the Trade Center, man.
Bob, you see that?

649
00:36:35,607 --> 00:36:37,165
Man, that's a lot of smoke.

650
00:36:37,242 --> 00:36:38,539
TEPPER: I can't believe that.

651
00:36:42,413 --> 00:36:44,973
Yeah, take a look
at the World Trade Center.

652
00:36:46,084 --> 00:36:47,381
No, I have no idea.

653
00:36:47,452 --> 00:36:50,319
I'm getting reports
from numerous aircraft
about smoke in Manhattan.

654
00:36:50,388 --> 00:36:51,719
A lot of smoke.

655
00:36:51,789 --> 00:36:54,314
A lot of smoke coming out
of the North Tower.

656
00:36:54,392 --> 00:36:55,552
(PHONE RINGING)

657
00:36:56,694 --> 00:36:58,252
Thumbser, go ahead.

658
00:37:00,098 --> 00:37:01,292
The American
was over Manhattan

659
00:37:01,366 --> 00:37:03,493
A small plane?
Is that confirmed?
When I lost any sign of...

660
00:37:04,335 --> 00:37:06,496
Ben, I just got...
New York called.
Yeah?

661
00:37:06,571 --> 00:37:08,436
They got smoke
out of the
World Trade Center.

662
00:37:08,506 --> 00:37:09,803
Smoke?
They think
a small plane

663
00:37:09,874 --> 00:37:11,569
A small plane?
Has crashed into it.

664
00:37:11,643 --> 00:37:12,632
Small plane.
I don't know.

665
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:13,734
That's what
they're telling me.

666
00:37:13,811 --> 00:37:15,711
A small plane
went into the
World Trade Center.

667
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,645
You might want to
have a look.
Okay.

668
00:37:17,715 --> 00:37:18,875
Sir.

669
00:37:19,017 --> 00:37:20,006
Sir.

670
00:37:20,385 --> 00:37:24,412
CNN's reporting a light
civil aircraft has just hit
the World Trade Center.

671
00:37:25,423 --> 00:37:26,685
MCC?

672
00:37:26,758 --> 00:37:30,751
<i>MCC, CNN has just reported</i>
<i>a light aircraft has hit</i>
<i>the World Trade Center.</i>

673
00:37:30,828 --> 00:37:33,820
Bill, get me CNN
up on screen three, will you?

674
00:37:34,232 --> 00:37:35,256
Ben?
Yeah.

675
00:37:35,333 --> 00:37:36,357
New York Center called.

676
00:37:36,434 --> 00:37:38,402
They were tracking
the primary target,
they've lost it.

677
00:37:38,469 --> 00:37:40,130
They said they'd
lost American 11.

678
00:37:40,204 --> 00:37:41,865
Where did they lose it at?
Somewhere over the city.

679
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:42,998
Over the city?
Yeah.

680
00:37:43,074 --> 00:37:44,507
He's down over the city?
They don't know

681
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:46,100
if he's under the radar
coverage out there or not.

682
00:37:46,177 --> 00:37:48,737
All right. Get in touch with
the metro towers,
see if they got a visual.

683
00:37:48,813 --> 00:37:50,246
Hey, it's
coming up now.
I'll call TRACON, see if...

684
00:37:50,315 --> 00:37:51,714
Jesus.
Oh, my...

685
00:37:51,783 --> 00:37:54,149
WOMAN ON T. V: <i>... we're</i>
<i>getting reports this morning,</i>
<i>that a plane</i>

686
00:37:54,218 --> 00:37:57,813
<i>has crashed into one</i>
<i>of the towers of</i>
<i>the World Trade Center.</i>

687
00:37:57,889 --> 00:38:00,949
<i>CNN Center right now</i>
<i>is just beginning</i>
<i>to work on this story.</i>

688
00:38:01,025 --> 00:38:04,324
<i>Obviously calling our sources</i>
<i>and trying to figure out</i>
<i>exactly what happened.</i>

689
00:38:04,395 --> 00:38:08,855
<i>But clearly something</i>
<i>relatively devastating</i>
<i>happening this morning there</i>

690
00:38:08,933 --> 00:38:10,958
<i>in the south end</i>
<i>of the island...</i>
I don't know.

691
00:38:11,035 --> 00:38:13,435
I'll tell you what,
that is not a small plane.
No way.

692
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,493
It's huge.

693
00:38:14,572 --> 00:38:16,631
A Cessna would have
bounced off that. Look at
the size of that hole!

694
00:38:16,708 --> 00:38:17,868
Look at all them
people sitting...

695
00:38:17,942 --> 00:38:20,877
I got a bad feeling
about this. I'll tell you
right now.

696
00:38:20,945 --> 00:38:23,311
Is that American 11?
Is that who they
were tracking?

697
00:38:23,381 --> 00:38:25,212
Nobody's
telling us anything.
No info. I have no info.

698
00:38:25,283 --> 00:38:28,047
Well, which way are we
looking here?
If we're looking...

699
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:31,145
It looks like the sun's
on that side of the building,
so we're looking north.

700
00:38:31,222 --> 00:38:34,020
He came from our left.
He had to come from the west.

701
00:38:34,092 --> 00:38:36,356
That aircraft came
in from the west
into that building.

702
00:38:36,427 --> 00:38:38,418
Who could it be?
Now where's American 11?

703
00:38:38,496 --> 00:38:40,964
You know what I want
you to do? Get in touch
with the NYPD.

704
00:38:41,032 --> 00:38:43,762
See if they have
any information on what caused
that in the Trade Center.

705
00:38:43,835 --> 00:38:45,166
Look at the size
of that explosion.

706
00:38:45,236 --> 00:38:48,603
MAN: <i>... Sean, you're</i>
<i>on the air right now.</i>
<i>What can you tell us about...</i>

707
00:38:48,673 --> 00:38:49,935
And, folks, Captain Dahl.

708
00:38:50,008 --> 00:38:52,499
We've reached our
cruising altitude
of 35,000 feet

709
00:38:52,577 --> 00:38:54,909
and I'm going ahead and turn
the "Fasten Seat Belts"
sign off.

710
00:38:54,979 --> 00:38:56,947
<i>That is your signal</i>
<i>you are safe</i>
<i>to move about the cabin.</i>

711
00:38:57,015 --> 00:38:58,380
We got
the seatbelt sign off.

712
00:38:58,449 --> 00:38:59,507
DAHL: <i>However, when you</i>
<i>are in your seats</i>

713
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,846
<i>I'll ask you to keep</i>
<i>your seatbelts</i>
<i>loosely fastened,</i>

714
00:39:00,918 --> 00:39:03,409
<i>as you never know</i>
<i>when we'll get some bumps</i>
<i>we're not expecting.</i>

715
00:39:03,488 --> 00:39:06,150
<i>Our flying time today again</i>
<i>is 5 hours and 25 minutes,</i>

716
00:39:06,224 --> 00:39:08,215
<i>and in spite of that</i>
<i>short delay back there</i>
<i>in Newark</i>

717
00:39:08,292 --> 00:39:11,159
<i>I'm still projecting</i>
<i>an on-time arrival</i>
<i>in San Francisco.</i>

718
00:39:11,262 --> 00:39:13,753
<i>I'll update you on the weather</i>
<i>as we get a little closer.</i>

719
00:39:13,831 --> 00:39:15,765
<i>In the interim now,</i>
<i>I'll ask you to sit back</i>
<i>and enjoy</i>

720
00:39:15,833 --> 00:39:18,028
<i>the outstanding service</i>
<i>of our fine flight attendants.</i>

721
00:39:18,102 --> 00:39:21,196
<i>If there's anything we</i>

722
00:39:21,272 --> 00:39:22,569

723
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,971
<i>Thank you.</i>

724
00:39:34,352 --> 00:39:35,876
Hey, can I get
a copy of the manifest?

725
00:39:35,953 --> 00:39:36,977
Oh, sure.

726
00:39:37,055 --> 00:39:38,784
Thanks.
Here you go.

727
00:39:38,856 --> 00:39:39,880
I appreciate it.

728
00:39:39,957 --> 00:39:40,981
Yeah, no problem.

729
00:39:41,059 --> 00:39:42,959
Looks pretty good, huh?

730
00:39:43,227 --> 00:39:44,489
I love these light loads.

731
00:39:44,562 --> 00:39:45,824
I do, too.

732
00:39:47,098 --> 00:39:49,965
I knew you were
gonna say that,
so I've planned.

733
00:39:50,034 --> 00:39:51,365
We've got...

734
00:39:51,436 --> 00:39:54,928
We have reservations there.

735
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,171
And there.

736
00:39:58,009 --> 00:40:00,944
Fedex 7852, we heard
it was a small plane that hit
the World Trade Center.

737
00:40:01,012 --> 00:40:02,240
That's the last
that we heard.
Roger.

738
00:40:02,313 --> 00:40:05,544
Eagle 755,
you contact
departure on 126.8.

739
00:40:05,616 --> 00:40:08,210
I gave you that
Eagle 755 also, okay?
Another one?

740
00:40:08,286 --> 00:40:10,982
Yeah, Eagle 755.
755. Got it.

741
00:40:11,055 --> 00:40:14,855
Toggle 9445,
you contact
approach on 120.8.

742
00:40:14,926 --> 00:40:16,587
Chris, I need you
to take this one also.
Got it.

743
00:40:16,661 --> 00:40:19,323
Hey, Dave, you got
an untracked target five miles
east of Allentown.

744
00:40:19,397 --> 00:40:20,386
Thank you.

745
00:40:20,465 --> 00:40:24,299
United 175, I need you
to reset your transponder
squawk 2374.

746
00:40:27,872 --> 00:40:30,670
United 175, New York.
You read the radio?

747
00:40:31,709 --> 00:40:33,973
Call American 11 again.
I'll try him again.

748
00:40:34,045 --> 00:40:35,808
Paul, neither
airport had one.
Maybe... He must've landed.

749
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,347
Newark heard nothing from him,
Kennedy heard...

750
00:40:37,415 --> 00:40:38,848
Try the towers again.
I'll try again.

751
00:40:38,916 --> 00:40:41,214
He's gotta be somewhere.
He's gotta go somewhere.

752
00:40:41,285 --> 00:40:43,378
United 175, New York.
If you read the radio, ident.

753
00:40:43,454 --> 00:40:44,819
Traffic's 9 o'clock and seven.

754
00:40:44,889 --> 00:40:48,381
Southwestbound
Delta Boeing 73,
same altitude.

755
00:40:49,994 --> 00:40:51,962
United 175, New York.

756
00:40:53,164 --> 00:40:54,426
United...

757
00:40:54,499 --> 00:40:57,935
Paul, United. I think we got
another one. The guy has
dropped his transponder off.

758
00:40:58,002 --> 00:41:00,163
(PHONE RINGING)
United 175, New York.
He's out by Allentown.

759
00:41:00,238 --> 00:41:01,637
United 175.
Thumbser.

760
00:41:01,706 --> 00:41:05,164
If you have United 175,
you need to switch him
back to... The traffic room.

761
00:41:05,243 --> 00:41:07,677
No, I'm not talking to him.
I'm not talking to him.
I know.

762
00:41:07,745 --> 00:41:10,111
Delta 2433, stand by.

763
00:41:10,181 --> 00:41:12,581
I can't take
any more airplanes.

764
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:15,813
He's busy enough.
We'll take care of it.
We'll take care of it.

765
00:41:15,887 --> 00:41:18,117
We'll take care of it.
They're standing by,
right now.

766
00:41:18,189 --> 00:41:21,249
Watch that Delta 2315.
He's aimed right at him.
The same altitude.

767
00:41:21,325 --> 00:41:23,225
He's starting to get
close to him.
You see that?

768
00:41:23,861 --> 00:41:24,885
Please.

769
00:41:24,962 --> 00:41:27,089
Give me a chance to work.
Just stay back!

770
00:41:27,165 --> 00:41:29,793
Just give me a chance
to work here, all right?

771
00:41:30,401 --> 00:41:32,562
United 175, New York,
if you read the radio,

772
00:41:32,637 --> 00:41:35,265
you have traffic at
your 9 o'clock and
four miles southwestbound,

773
00:41:35,339 --> 00:41:36,931
same altitude.
It's a Boeing 73.

774
00:41:37,008 --> 00:41:39,442
I'm telling you
this is another hijack.
I'm telling you.

775
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:42,809
United 175,
traffic is your 9 o'clock
in five miles.

776
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,541
Jesus.
Do you have that Delta?

777
00:41:44,615 --> 00:41:48,415
Delta! Delta 2315,
traffic 2 o'clock!

778
00:41:48,486 --> 00:41:51,512
Five miles,
southeastbound, 757.

779
00:41:51,589 --> 00:41:53,489
Traffic, three miles.
Turn him. Turn him.

780
00:41:53,558 --> 00:41:54,991
1 o'clock!
Turn to one and a half.

781
00:41:55,059 --> 00:41:56,856
Heading southeastbound.
12 o'clock now!

782
00:41:56,928 --> 00:41:58,054
No distance!
He's right on top of you!

783
00:41:58,129 --> 00:41:59,528
I'm telling you right now.
This is another hijacking.

784
00:41:59,597 --> 00:42:02,862
Delta 2315,
he's right on top of you.
This is a hijacking.

785
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,607
Delta 2315,
you still there?

786
00:42:23,855 --> 00:42:27,416
PILOT: <i>That's a roger,</i>
<i>New York. We are clear.</i>
<i>Delta 2315. Over.</i>

787
00:42:27,825 --> 00:42:29,087
Paul, he just went
behind him.

788
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,525
Holy shit.
Good. Good.

789
00:42:30,595 --> 00:42:32,563
Good job, sir. Good job.

<i>inside her apartment, and she</i>

All right. Thank you much.

<i>... explode into flames</i>
<i>and black smoke.</i>

793
00:42:40,137 --> 00:42:42,071
Excuse me.
If they hijacked them...

794
00:42:42,139 --> 00:42:45,131
New York Center says they got
confirmation that it was
a commercial airliner

795
00:42:45,209 --> 00:42:46,836
that hit the Trade Center.
Well, that's it.

796
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:49,539
That was American 11.
It had to be American 11.

797
00:42:49,614 --> 00:42:53,106
What the hell is going on?
But how could he hit
the building?

798
00:42:53,184 --> 00:42:56,347
I mean, why would he hit
the building? Even if it is
American 11, why...

799
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:58,786
It's clear and fifty.
You don't get
a pilot flying a plane...

800
00:42:58,856 --> 00:43:00,517
Either they're gonna
ditch it in the Hudson...

801
00:43:00,591 --> 00:43:02,752
They're not gonna do this.
There's no way. No way.

802
00:43:02,827 --> 00:43:05,057
Jesus, how many people
are in that building?

803
00:43:06,097 --> 00:43:07,928
SMITH: Ben? Ben?

804
00:43:08,332 --> 00:43:10,425
I'm sorry, New York Center
wants you on the phone
right now.

805
00:43:10,501 --> 00:43:12,264
Yeah. Yes, New York.

806
00:43:14,505 --> 00:43:16,598
Wait a minute, hold on.
They think they
got another hijack,

807
00:43:16,674 --> 00:43:18,005
and it's headed for New York.
Another one?

808
00:43:18,075 --> 00:43:19,269
We got another hijack?

809
00:43:19,343 --> 00:43:21,607
All right, United 175.
Get him up on there.

810
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:22,941
How many people
are in that building?

811
00:43:23,014 --> 00:43:24,174
Where is
that military liaison?

812
00:43:24,248 --> 00:43:26,614
Can somebody help us out?
We need some help here.

813
00:43:26,717 --> 00:43:28,810
We're trying to get
the military involved.

814
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,109
We can't get anybody
at headquarters.

815
00:43:31,088 --> 00:43:34,353
All right, listen, you take
care of your house, we'll take
care of this business.

816
00:43:34,425 --> 00:43:36,484
Okay. Let me know
if anything else develops.

817
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,620
United 175,
and it's headed
straight for New York.

818
00:43:39,697 --> 00:43:42,825
United 175, New York.
United 175.

819
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:44,697
United 175, New York.

820
00:43:45,169 --> 00:43:47,797
United 175 here.
This guy's at, like,
10,000 feet a minute,

821
00:43:47,872 --> 00:43:49,203
and he's still going down.
I heard. I heard.

822
00:43:49,273 --> 00:43:51,104
(PHONE RINGING)
United 175, New York.

823
00:43:52,076 --> 00:43:54,943
This guy's dropping
like a manhole cover
now, Paul.

824
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:58,715
He's still descending
eastbound towards
New York.

825
00:43:58,783 --> 00:44:01,479
This aircraft is going down,
I'm telling you right now.

826
00:44:01,552 --> 00:44:02,644
Call the military up.

827
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,119
Find out
where they are.
Okay.

828
00:44:04,188 --> 00:44:05,177
Are you listening to me?

829
00:44:05,256 --> 00:44:07,486
This guy is going
straight down into the ground,
I'm telling you.

830
00:44:07,558 --> 00:44:08,684
He's not answering me.

831
00:44:08,759 --> 00:44:10,784
We're not talking to him.
He's descending.

832
00:44:10,861 --> 00:44:12,385
It's like 6,000 to
8,000 feet a minute now.

833
00:44:12,463 --> 00:44:15,261
Dave, you still not
talking to that guy?
No, I'm not.

834
00:44:15,333 --> 00:44:18,530
He's going right through
everybody else's traffic.

835
00:44:20,071 --> 00:44:22,005
The target's gone. It's gone.

836
00:44:22,073 --> 00:44:24,337
The target's gone.
The target's gone.

837
00:44:25,943 --> 00:44:28,844
We don't have him anymore.
We just lost him.

838
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:33,241
All right, hold on. Hold on.
I got a primary on a target.

839
00:44:33,317 --> 00:44:35,251
Where?
He's rapidly
descending.

840
00:44:35,319 --> 00:44:36,911
Can you see that right here?

841
00:44:36,988 --> 00:44:39,183
He's coming down quick, yeah.
Can you see that?

842
00:44:39,256 --> 00:44:40,382
Well, who is it?

843
00:44:40,491 --> 00:44:41,480
I don't know.

844
00:44:42,493 --> 00:44:43,551
You see him
out the window?

845
00:44:43,627 --> 00:44:44,787
I don't know.

846
00:44:44,862 --> 00:44:46,227
Is he out there?

847
00:44:46,564 --> 00:44:47,895
Yeah, descending rapidly.

848
00:44:47,965 --> 00:44:49,057
No, there he is.
There he is.

849
00:44:49,133 --> 00:44:50,896
Where?
Right there.
Over the Verrazano Bridge.

850
00:44:50,968 --> 00:44:53,368
Oh, yeah.
Look how fast he's going.

851
00:44:53,437 --> 00:44:55,234
No, he's going right up
the Hudson River center.

852
00:44:55,306 --> 00:44:56,398
Oh, my God.

853
00:45:00,845 --> 00:45:01,937
(ALL EXCLAIMING)

854
00:45:02,013 --> 00:45:03,537
Jesus! Shit!

855
00:45:03,681 --> 00:45:04,841
(SCREAMING) What?
How does he do that?

856
00:45:04,915 --> 00:45:07,748
ANCHORMAN: <i>There was</i>
<i>then an explosion inside...</i>
Damn it!

857
00:45:07,818 --> 00:45:10,844
MAN: <i>The building's exploding</i>

858
00:45:10,921 --> 00:45:12,513
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>what the hell is going on.</i>

859
00:45:12,590 --> 00:45:15,320
Did you see that?
Did you see that, sir?

860
00:45:17,528 --> 00:45:19,393
I'll have
to call you back.

861
00:45:19,697 --> 00:45:20,823
Oh, my God.

862
00:45:20,898 --> 00:45:22,627
<i>American, stand by.</i>

863
00:45:25,703 --> 00:45:27,034
Holy shit!

864
00:45:27,204 --> 00:45:28,694
Jesus Christ.

865
00:45:42,153 --> 00:45:44,621
ANCHORWOMAN: <i>Be advised</i>
<i>there's a major incident</i>
<i>over New York right now.</i>

866
00:45:44,688 --> 00:45:47,623
Shawna, what do you got?
What do you got, Shawna?

867
00:45:47,691 --> 00:45:49,454
Boston said that...

868
00:45:50,528 --> 00:45:54,862
Boston just said they have
another hijacked aircraft.
United 175.

869
00:45:54,932 --> 00:45:57,332
Copy that.
We've got another hijack.

870
00:45:57,401 --> 00:46:00,461
We've got two hijacks.
175, also out of Boston.

871
00:46:00,538 --> 00:46:02,563
Are they...
Does Boston... Is...

872
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,870
Get on with FAA.
Who was that?

873
00:46:05,409 --> 00:46:06,967
There's no confirmation, sir.

874
00:46:07,044 --> 00:46:09,740
<i>MCC, we need our planes</i>
<i>over Manhattan.</i>

875
00:46:09,814 --> 00:46:11,645
<i>We need those Otis birds</i>
<i>over Manhattan now.</i>

876
00:46:11,715 --> 00:46:14,479
You got it! All right,
weapons! Weapons!

877
00:46:19,356 --> 00:46:20,516
You want any sugar
in your coffee?

878
00:46:20,591 --> 00:46:21,683
I'm fine for now, thanks.

879
00:46:21,759 --> 00:46:23,818
What would you
like to drink?
I'm glued to this.

880
00:46:23,894 --> 00:46:25,486
Coffee or juice?

881
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:28,055
Yeah, I'll take
some coffee.
Hi, guys.

882
00:46:28,132 --> 00:46:29,997
You know,
I'm gonna serve you
guys after first,

883
00:46:30,067 --> 00:46:32,262
'cause there's only six,
if that's okay.

884
00:46:32,336 --> 00:46:34,201
It was a beautiful take-off.

885
00:46:35,206 --> 00:46:36,935
So you're still okay
with the hot?

886
00:46:37,007 --> 00:46:39,908
All right, well, then,
we'll bring you something
to drink after that.

887
00:46:39,977 --> 00:46:42,070
Yeah, it's like football
with no padding.
Here you go, sir.

888
00:46:42,146 --> 00:46:43,636
(WHISPERING IN ARABIC)
Hope you all enjoy this.

889
00:46:44,081 --> 00:46:45,912
And I'll be
right with you, guys.

890
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:09,565
And here we go. All right.

891
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:11,130
Why don't we turn
this around?
BOTH: Thank you.

892
00:47:11,208 --> 00:47:12,300
If you could help me.
Thank you.

893
00:47:12,376 --> 00:47:13,502
Yeah, that
would be great.
Thank you.

894
00:47:13,577 --> 00:47:15,067
Thanks a lot.
Enjoy.

895
00:47:21,585 --> 00:47:23,416
(SPEAKING IN ARABIC)

896
00:47:34,565 --> 00:47:37,830
New York Center wants
everything stopped going to
their airports and through...

897
00:47:37,902 --> 00:47:40,496
All right, Tony, issue
a ground stop
for New York Center.

898
00:47:40,571 --> 00:47:42,505
Nothing goes
into New York Center.

899
00:47:42,573 --> 00:47:44,871
Got it.
At least the
first tier on that. Yeah.

900
00:47:45,342 --> 00:47:49,005
In fact... Hey, you know what?
Let's stop Boston, New York,

901
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:50,808
and then maybe
stop Washington, too.

902
00:47:50,881 --> 00:47:53,543
Yeah, whatever's necessary.
Just get them stopped now.

903
00:47:53,617 --> 00:47:56,882
I don't want any more planes
on their frequency taking off.

904
00:47:58,222 --> 00:48:00,053
Boston, we have
no confirmation...

905
00:48:00,157 --> 00:48:01,146
Copy type and tail.

906
00:48:02,626 --> 00:48:03,752
Foxy!

907
00:48:03,827 --> 00:48:07,263
I'm hearing about
another hijack.
Keep your ears open.

908
00:48:07,331 --> 00:48:09,196
Too much traffic.
We can't get the clearance.

909
00:48:09,266 --> 00:48:10,824
That's not acceptable.

910
00:48:10,901 --> 00:48:12,129
They're not giving it to us.

911
00:48:12,203 --> 00:48:15,229
If you need to,
get on the line and
get the clearance for them,

912
00:48:15,306 --> 00:48:17,206
but don't take that from them.

913
00:48:17,274 --> 00:48:19,299
<i>Where are those Otis planes?</i>
<i>Are we over Manhattan yet?</i>

914
00:48:19,376 --> 00:48:21,105
<i>What's going on? MCC.</i>

915
00:48:21,178 --> 00:48:23,112
What's the status
on Otis, Foxy?

916
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:25,148
We're still trying
to get a clearance, sir.

917
00:48:25,216 --> 00:48:28,674
We're getting no clearance
from the FAA to get those
birds over Manhattan.

918
00:48:28,752 --> 00:48:30,310
What do you want
me to tell weapons?

919
00:48:30,387 --> 00:48:32,651
Screw the FAA.
Send those Otis planes now.

920
00:48:32,723 --> 00:48:34,554
Get them over Manhattan.

921
00:48:34,625 --> 00:48:38,391
He says forget about the FAA.
Get those birds over
Manhattan now.

922
00:48:47,137 --> 00:48:49,935
United 93, Cleveland Center.
Good morning.

923
00:48:50,574 --> 00:48:53,941
United 93, Cleveland Center,
119.7. Good day.

924
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:57,238
You have the aircraft.

925
00:48:57,314 --> 00:48:58,303
I have the aircraft.

926
00:49:06,757 --> 00:49:10,056
Hi. Breakfast, guys.
Here's one with juice.

927
00:49:10,127 --> 00:49:11,116
Thank you.

928
00:49:11,195 --> 00:49:13,026
I'm bringing the other one
with coffee in one second.

929
00:49:13,097 --> 00:49:14,325
Thank you very much.
Enjoy, guys.
See you later.

930
00:49:14,398 --> 00:49:15,387
Thanks, Deb.
See you in a bit.

931
00:49:16,166 --> 00:49:17,428
What do you need over here?

932
00:49:18,569 --> 00:49:19,900
(WHISPERING)

933
00:49:20,404 --> 00:49:24,966
But you know, with girls
I can't, I could never, you
know, I couldn't control...

934
00:49:25,075 --> 00:49:26,064
(BEEPING)

935
00:49:30,347 --> 00:49:32,815
As soon as I get
on the ground,
I'll give her a call.

936
00:49:32,883 --> 00:49:34,976
You have kids?
Yeah, I do.

937
00:49:35,052 --> 00:49:37,384
I have a
11-month-old daughter.

938
00:49:38,422 --> 00:49:41,186
Eleven months. How's that?
You getting
any sleep at night?

939
00:49:41,258 --> 00:49:44,193
She's finally beginning
to settle down now,
so everything's looking good.

940
00:49:44,261 --> 00:49:47,753
My anniversary's coming up,
I'm taking my wife to London
for a couple days.

941
00:49:47,831 --> 00:49:50,823
Well, that should be good.
Yeah, I've been to London
a couple times.

942
00:49:50,901 --> 00:49:52,630
You know,
we're gonna do the usual.

943
00:49:52,703 --> 00:49:56,537
A little sightseeing,
do a couple plays
and just kind of get away.

944
00:49:56,774 --> 00:49:59,402
I've got Otis in the air,
and two more at Langley.

945
00:49:59,476 --> 00:50:01,273
Four planes.
That's all I've got.

946
00:50:01,345 --> 00:50:04,178
I'm gonna need some support.
I'm gonna need more planes.

947
00:50:04,248 --> 00:50:08,651
I've got Otis headed to
Manhattan and... No, the FAA
is giving us problems.

948
00:50:08,719 --> 00:50:11,916
WOMAN: All the other
fighter planes that are on
the East Coast. Oceana.

949
00:50:11,989 --> 00:50:13,820
No, I sent them anyway.

950
00:50:13,891 --> 00:50:16,359
Right now,
Langley's sitting
at battle stations, sir.

951
00:50:16,427 --> 00:50:17,724
Copy that.

952
00:50:17,995 --> 00:50:19,462
Okay. MCC!

953
00:50:20,331 --> 00:50:23,391
Boston is telling us
American 11
is still in the air.

954
00:50:23,467 --> 00:50:25,526
What?
American 11
is still in the air.

955
00:50:25,602 --> 00:50:27,229
We don't know who
those planes are.

956
00:50:27,304 --> 00:50:29,534
American 11
is still flying?
Headed towards Washington.

957
00:50:29,606 --> 00:50:30,595
God damn it!

958
00:50:30,674 --> 00:50:33,609
All right, surveillance,
we got American 11, heading
towards Washington now!

959
00:50:33,744 --> 00:50:37,043
Let's go. I want you to
light up every track south of
New York over Jersey.

960
00:50:37,114 --> 00:50:39,344
Colonel. Colonel.
Hang on. Hang on, sir.

961
00:50:39,416 --> 00:50:40,474
Yes, go, MCC.

962
00:50:40,551 --> 00:50:42,781
Boston is saying
that American 11

963
00:50:42,886 --> 00:50:45,980
<i>is heading towards Washington</i>
<i>now. That it's not</i>
<i>one of the flights</i>

964
00:50:46,056 --> 00:50:48,820
that went into the
Trade Centers, but it's
heading towards Washington.

965
00:50:48,892 --> 00:50:50,655
We gotta scramble
those Langley birds
right now.

966
00:50:50,728 --> 00:50:52,753
MAN: <i>What the fuck?</i>
Hold on, sir.

967
00:50:52,830 --> 00:50:55,458
Scramble Langley.
Scramble Langley
to Washington.

968
00:50:55,532 --> 00:50:57,500
Scramble Langley,
weapons.
Copy that.

969
00:50:57,568 --> 00:50:59,536
Scramble them
to Washington.
Scramble Langley.

970
00:50:59,603 --> 00:51:02,367
No, we just got a report.
We're getting
bad stuff from the FAA.

971
00:51:02,439 --> 00:51:06,034
Bad stuff from the FAA
all around. They just told us
that 11 was still flying.

972
00:51:06,110 --> 00:51:07,702
We thought 11
went into the tower.

973
00:51:07,778 --> 00:51:10,941
All parties acknowledge
with initials. Command posts.

974
00:51:11,014 --> 00:51:14,643
Tower. Approach. Giant Killer.

975
00:51:15,085 --> 00:51:16,746
Gentlemen, gentlemen!
Here's what I want.

976
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:18,515
I want you to contact
all the centers.

977
00:51:18,589 --> 00:51:21,558
I want to know about
any aircraft that
they deem suspicious.

978
00:51:21,625 --> 00:51:26,255
There's NORDO or
lost transponder, off-course,
change altitude.

979
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:29,561
And let's get it on that board
down there and start sharing
this information.

980
00:51:29,633 --> 00:51:31,294
Particularly
with the military.

981
00:51:31,368 --> 00:51:33,029
Where is that
military liaison?

982
00:51:33,103 --> 00:51:36,504
Go get him.
Yeah, tell him I need
to speak to him now.

983
00:51:37,875 --> 00:51:41,072
Indy Center just called.
They're missing
an American 77.

984
00:51:41,145 --> 00:51:42,874
They lost it 25 minutes ago.

985
00:51:42,946 --> 00:51:45,073
It deviated off...
American 77.

986
00:51:45,149 --> 00:51:47,913
American 77.
Out of
Indianapolis Center.

987
00:51:48,051 --> 00:51:51,179
They said that he lost
his transponder after
he turned off-course.

988
00:51:51,255 --> 00:51:54,713
We got an American 77
out of Dulles,
lost the transponder.

989
00:51:55,025 --> 00:51:58,290
All right, I need...
I want last-known position,
speed and altitude.

990
00:51:58,362 --> 00:52:00,762
I want it in his track.
I want to know where
he's heading.

991
00:52:00,831 --> 00:52:02,890
We just had two
go into the city.

992
00:52:02,966 --> 00:52:06,458
And, you know, anything is
suspect now, especially if
he's heading toward the city.

993
00:52:06,537 --> 00:52:08,471
I need last-known
position and track.

994
00:52:08,539 --> 00:52:11,440
All right, do you know
who that second airplane was?

995
00:52:11,508 --> 00:52:13,066
Okay. If you find out,
let me know.

996
00:52:13,143 --> 00:52:16,271
Boston's tracking
another one, Delta 1989.

997
00:52:16,346 --> 00:52:19,577
He's another
Boston-to-LAX, 767.

998
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:20,981
Right now he's on course.

999
00:52:21,051 --> 00:52:23,884
They are talking to him,
but they're very concerned
about that flight

1000
00:52:23,954 --> 00:52:26,218
because it's the
exact same profile
as these last two.

1001
00:52:26,290 --> 00:52:30,590
All right, so listen, fellas.
I want you to get a ground
stop out across the nation.

1002
00:52:30,661 --> 00:52:32,720
I don't want anybody else
coming into our airspace.

1003
00:52:32,796 --> 00:52:35,492
How many have I got
airborne now?
4,000 or 5,000.

1004
00:52:35,566 --> 00:52:36,965
Huh?
Between 4,000 and 5,000.

1005
00:52:37,034 --> 00:52:39,502
4,200.
4,200? Jesus Christ.

1006
00:52:39,570 --> 00:52:41,595
All right, no more
departures anywhere.
You got that?

1007
00:52:41,672 --> 00:52:44,766
Call Boston. Call Cleveland.
No more departures.

1008
00:52:45,576 --> 00:52:49,876
Copy. Boston-to-LA
and that's Delta 1989,
suspected hijack.

1009
00:52:50,214 --> 00:52:53,672
Eagle flight 248,
contact Cleveland Center,
134.6.

1010
00:52:56,186 --> 00:53:00,020
John, there's a suspected
hijack from Center at Boston,
all right?

1011
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:01,819
I need you to confirm
when you can, all right?

1012
00:53:01,892 --> 00:53:04,383
Let me know if
you hear anything. Delta 1989.

1013
00:53:04,461 --> 00:53:06,395
I'll let you know.
Soon as I can.

1014
00:53:06,463 --> 00:53:09,455
United 93,
Cleveland Center.
Go ahead.

1015
00:53:09,933 --> 00:53:14,063
Cleveland Center,
United 93. Level 350.
Still have that light chop.

1016

1017

the World Trade Center."

1018
00:53:28,886 --> 00:53:32,049

I'm gonna...
Let me just confirm this.

1020
00:53:37,361 --> 00:53:39,226
What have you got?
Do we have anything on 11?

1021
00:53:39,296 --> 00:53:40,593
You're spotting nothing?

1022
00:53:40,664 --> 00:53:43,531
Come on, guys.
Beat the bushes. Where is
this guy? What's he doing?

1023
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:46,763
I got two F-16s ready to turn
and burn toward Washington.

1024

00:54:01,752 --> 00:54:03,219
Do we shoot this flight down?

1031

do we have to go? SecDef?

1032

1033

has to make the call.
Yes, sir.

going on.

I need you to do everything
you can to get these lines
of communication open.

1053

into that goddamn building.

going on. We've given

your job to do this, but
you've gotta do what you can.

00:55:10,887 --> 00:55:15,415

every one of those aircraft
on that board.

with the Pentagon or are you
talking to some liaison?

of the situation. I'll give

I don't think

Wait a minute. Delta.
What about Delta?

1166

Delta's answering. Delta's
fine so far. The only one
I don't have is the United 93.

He appears to be climbing now.

There's a United 93,

Newark-to-San Francisco
flight. He's still on course.

01:11:59,362 --> 01:12:01,227
Think about what happens
if they hit the ground.

1287
01:12:01,297 --> 01:12:04,232
(THUDDING)
Think of what...
If they hit the Capitol, sir.

1288
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:06,200
Go ahead, MCC.
Go ahead, go ahead.

1289
01:12:06,268 --> 01:12:09,237
We got two F-16s coming
out of Selfridge,
but they're unarmed.

1290
01:12:09,305 --> 01:12:11,364
But how many more
are out there?
That's the question.

1291
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:14,876
We've got a report of at least
one more. May we engage?

1292
01:12:17,113 --> 01:12:18,740
I think
we shouldn't provoke them.

1293
01:12:18,814 --> 01:12:20,008
Just do what they want.

1294
01:12:20,082 --> 01:12:22,676
And then they'll land
and let us go and
let the authorities...

1295
01:12:22,752 --> 01:12:23,810
Shouldn't somebody
try to talk to them?

1296
01:12:23,886 --> 01:12:25,319
ADAMS: The police, they'll
take care of them.

1297
01:12:25,388 --> 01:12:26,446
MARCIN: Give them
what they want.

1298
01:12:26,522 --> 01:12:28,422
Maybe we can
negotiate with them.

1299
01:12:48,511 --> 01:12:49,671
Quiet.

1300
01:13:14,036 --> 01:13:15,867
(SPEAKING IN ARABIC)

1301
01:13:33,856 --> 01:13:36,689
Just listen to me, sweetie,
I want you to call
the authorities...

1302
01:13:36,759 --> 01:13:38,954
I'm calling from the Airfone.

1303
01:13:40,730 --> 01:13:43,028
You believe me,
don't you, Mom?

1304
01:13:45,334 --> 01:13:46,892
Did he stab him?

1305
01:13:53,509 --> 01:13:55,306
We got to go up there.

1306
01:14:00,382 --> 01:14:02,509
Just take us back
to the airport...

1307
01:14:02,585 --> 01:14:04,712
LYLES: It's all right.
It's just us.

1308
01:14:05,087 --> 01:14:07,954
Let us see the passenger.
Just the passenger.

1309
01:14:09,658 --> 01:14:11,421
Richard, it's Jeremy.

1310
01:14:11,494 --> 01:14:13,894
I'm on the plane.
Let me talk to Lyzzie.

1311
01:14:14,063 --> 01:14:16,793
I'm on the plane.
Let me talk to Lyzzie.

1312
01:14:21,170 --> 01:14:22,660
Okay... You.

1313
01:14:23,906 --> 01:14:25,464
LYLES: There's the passenger
he stabbed.

1314
01:14:25,541 --> 01:14:26,530
BRADSHAW: Okay. Okay.

1315
01:14:27,376 --> 01:14:29,503
Okay. We're just
checking the passenger.

1316
01:14:29,578 --> 01:14:31,205
BURNETT: Did you contact
the pilot?

1317
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:35,114
No, nobody said anything.
We can't get through
to the cockpit.

1318
01:14:35,251 --> 01:14:36,684
We can't get through.

1319
01:14:39,088 --> 01:14:40,715
Okay, okay, okay.

1320
01:14:41,157 --> 01:14:42,988
Sir, okay. Okay, sir.

1321
01:14:43,359 --> 01:14:47,693
We're United flight 93. We've
been hijacked. There's three
men with knives.

1322
01:14:48,430 --> 01:14:51,593
One of them has a bomb
strapped around his waist.

1323
01:15:05,347 --> 01:15:07,577
See if he has a pulse.
Is he breathing?

1324
01:15:09,852 --> 01:15:12,320
No, there's nothing.
There's nothing.

1325
01:15:15,357 --> 01:15:16,585
Ahmed.

1326
01:15:26,235 --> 01:15:27,600
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1327
01:15:27,670 --> 01:15:29,604
You've got to
come back here.
What is it?

1328
01:15:29,672 --> 01:15:31,333
Come back here,
come back here.
What?

1329
01:15:31,407 --> 01:15:33,875
Oh, my God. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

1330
01:15:35,277 --> 01:15:36,676
Oh, my God.

1331
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:41,272
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

1332
01:15:41,350 --> 01:15:43,648
Stewardess, what's happening
up there? What is happening?

1333
01:15:43,719 --> 01:15:45,846
This is awful. Listen...
What is happening?

1334
01:15:45,921 --> 01:15:49,084
Just... We're going back
to the airport. Everything's
gonna be fine.

1335
01:15:49,158 --> 01:15:50,557
BURNETT: Call the pilot.
Listen...

1336
01:15:50,626 --> 01:15:51,786
BRADSHAW: I don't know.

1337
01:15:51,861 --> 01:15:53,886
We're just finding out
what we can find out.

1338
01:15:53,963 --> 01:15:56,363
Get back here. Get back here.

1339
01:15:57,199 --> 01:15:58,962
Listen, listen, listen.

1340
01:15:59,034 --> 01:16:02,299
Listen! The pilots
are on the ground.

1341
01:16:02,371 --> 01:16:04,839
That was the pilots.
They're on the ground
outside the cockpit.

1342
01:16:04,907 --> 01:16:06,340
They're on the floor.

1343
01:16:06,408 --> 01:16:07,636
She saw the pilot what?

1344
01:16:07,710 --> 01:16:10,338
What? What did she say?

1345
01:16:10,412 --> 01:16:13,575
The stewardess just said
the pilots aren't flying
the plane.

1346
01:16:13,649 --> 01:16:17,176
She saw two bodies
in front of the cockpit
on the floor.

1347
01:16:19,121 --> 01:16:22,557
They said they saw the pilot
and the co-pilot on the floor.

1348
01:16:22,625 --> 01:16:23,922
Oh, Jesus.

1349
01:16:25,527 --> 01:16:27,017
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

1350
01:16:28,664 --> 01:16:30,689
<i>Flight United 93, call in.</i>

1351
01:16:31,066 --> 01:16:33,864
(SPEAKING IN ARABIC)

1352
01:16:45,648 --> 01:16:50,585
MCC? Cleveland is saying
that Delta 1989 is
considered a hijack.

1353
01:16:50,653 --> 01:16:52,951
They're considering
Delta 1989 a hijack.

1354
01:16:53,022 --> 01:16:56,185
We got Delta 1989,
suspected hijack,
heading west.

1355
01:16:56,258 --> 01:16:58,453
Hit me up every track.
Did you copy that, sir?

1356
01:16:58,527 --> 01:17:00,927
Two planes?
<i>Yes.</i>

1357
01:17:01,463 --> 01:17:03,294
This is a second plane,
sir, coming in.

1358
01:17:03,365 --> 01:17:07,961
We got the one going west
out of Boston, and American 11
coming into Washington.

1359
01:17:08,037 --> 01:17:09,868
We still got the
Selfridge planes, sir.

1360
01:17:09,939 --> 01:17:11,964
Yes, sir. These guys
are not armed.

1361
01:17:12,041 --> 01:17:14,236
These fighters are not armed,
and we could ram...

1362
01:17:14,310 --> 01:17:17,802
If we ram them and eject, sir.
Do we have the authority,
though?

1363
01:17:18,013 --> 01:17:22,473
Just spoke to Cleveland, they
said that US Air 2619 was
headed towards Chicago.

1364
01:17:22,551 --> 01:17:24,451
They've just evacuated
the Sears Tower.

1365
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:25,885
Jesus Christ!

1366
01:17:25,955 --> 01:17:28,253
United 93 is now
reported as NORDO.

1367
01:17:28,324 --> 01:17:31,157
No transponder, and
now heading eastbound,
over Cleveland.

1368
01:17:31,226 --> 01:17:32,750
Let me know what
the hell is going on.

1369
01:17:32,828 --> 01:17:34,625
Six miles southwest
of the White House,

1370
01:17:34,697 --> 01:17:36,961
Boston Center's tracking
a primary moving fast.

1371
01:17:37,032 --> 01:17:38,693
Call Dulles tower.

1372
01:17:38,767 --> 01:17:40,200
Give me this again.
Give me this again.

1373
01:17:40,936 --> 01:17:43,234
Can you get me some
verification on that?

1374
01:17:43,872 --> 01:17:45,499
Sir, we have a VFR aircraft

1375
01:17:45,574 --> 01:17:48,941
southwest of Washington,
headed straight in now.

1376
01:17:49,011 --> 01:17:50,569
Sir, I got another flight
coming up south.

1377
01:17:50,646 --> 01:17:52,045
We have a plane headed
toward the Capitol.

1378
01:17:52,147 --> 01:17:53,136
I got an unidentified plane...

1379
01:17:53,282 --> 01:17:56,251
Yes. I need to know about
the ROE. Can we engage?

1380
01:17:56,318 --> 01:17:59,219
I want you to give me
a 30-mile circle
around Reagan National.

1381
01:17:59,288 --> 01:18:01,654
Right now, you hit me up
every track on every aircraft.

1382
01:18:01,724 --> 01:18:04,056
Do we have any communication
with the President at all?

1383
01:18:04,126 --> 01:18:05,423
<i>Where are the fighters?</i>

1384
01:18:05,494 --> 01:18:07,018
How long can that take?

1385
01:18:07,096 --> 01:18:08,427
Air Force One's taken off.

1386
01:18:08,497 --> 01:18:11,159
They don't know anything
about it. They don't
know where he's going.

1387
01:18:11,233 --> 01:18:12,962
Ben, they're evacuating
the White House!

1388
01:18:13,035 --> 01:18:14,263
All right, thanks, Carol.

1389
01:18:14,336 --> 01:18:15,360
They're evacuating it
right now.

1390
01:18:15,437 --> 01:18:17,701
Hey, are we gonna get
an intercept on this, though?

1391
01:18:17,773 --> 01:18:18,865
Okay. Good!

1392
01:18:18,941 --> 01:18:21,501
Go get yourself out of
your chair and go down...

1393
01:18:21,577 --> 01:18:24,045
There's no coordination
between what NORAD has
and what we have.

1394
01:18:24,113 --> 01:18:25,842
You know where they're headed.

1395
01:18:25,914 --> 01:18:26,903
Just get the fighters
up there!

1396
01:18:27,016 --> 01:18:30,349
How about the Vice President,
sir? Do we have a location
on the Vice President?

1397
01:18:30,419 --> 01:18:33,013
Well, then the Vice President
can make the call.

1398
01:18:33,088 --> 01:18:35,613
The Vice President can make
the call. We can engage.

1399
01:18:35,691 --> 01:18:36,919
Holy shit.

1400
01:18:37,292 --> 01:18:40,784
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
What's the ETA on
those Langley birds?

1401
01:18:40,863 --> 01:18:42,091
Foxy!

1402
01:18:42,164 --> 01:18:43,597
Spiders are airborne at 0930,

1403
01:18:43,665 --> 01:18:46,759
but they brought them out on
an eastbound heading rather
than our northbound.

1404
01:18:46,835 --> 01:18:48,700
We're gonna get them turned
as soon as possible.

1405
01:18:48,771 --> 01:18:50,796
What the fuck? They're what?
They're heading east?

1406
01:18:50,873 --> 01:18:53,865
<i>What the hell is wrong out</i>
<i>there? Why are those planes</i>
<i>off-course?</i>

1407
01:18:53,942 --> 01:18:57,537
It looks like they came out on
a standard scramble heading
instead of the one I gave.

1408
01:18:57,613 --> 01:18:59,478
We're trying to get clearance
to turn them now.

1409
01:18:59,548 --> 01:19:00,879
NASYPANY: How the fuck
did they get out there?

1410
01:19:00,949 --> 01:19:02,109
I don't know, sir.

1411
01:19:02,184 --> 01:19:04,084
What the fuck are they doing
out over the water?

1412
01:19:04,153 --> 01:19:07,486
I don't care, God damn it,
if they break windows,
you turn them back over land!

1413
01:19:07,556 --> 01:19:09,786
Roll quad sevens.
Turn them towards
Washington now.

1414
01:19:09,858 --> 01:19:11,758
Keep looking for him.
Keep looking for him.

1415
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:15,062
REPORTER: <i>It was a plane</i>
<i>that crashed at the Pentagon.</i>

1416
01:19:15,130 --> 01:19:17,496
<i>And the Pentagon</i>
<i>is being evacuated.</i>

1417
01:19:17,566 --> 01:19:21,002
<i>There is a large fire there,</i>
<i>and that is the smoke you see</i>

1418
01:19:21,070 --> 01:19:23,368
<i>in the shot that you</i>
<i>are looking at now.</i>

1419
01:19:23,439 --> 01:19:26,431
<i>Whether that fire is</i>
<i>in the building itself</i>
<i>or outside,</i>

1420
01:19:26,508 --> 01:19:28,840
<i>we have not yet confirmed.</i>

1421
01:19:28,977 --> 01:19:31,810
<i>There is a fire on the Mall</i>
<i>in Washington.</i>

1422
01:19:32,147 --> 01:19:36,208
<i>The cause of the fire in</i>

<i>we cannot yet tell you.</i>

1423
01:19:36,285 --> 01:19:37,479
Oh, my gosh!

1424
01:19:37,553 --> 01:19:38,713
Foxy!
Sir.

1425
01:19:38,787 --> 01:19:40,880
I want those Langley birds
over Washington.

1426
01:19:40,956 --> 01:19:43,186
<i>... that two planes have</i>
<i>crashed into</i>
<i>the World Trade Center.</i>

1427
01:19:43,258 --> 01:19:45,522
Surveillance, I want
you to hit up tracks
west of Cleveland...

1428
01:19:45,594 --> 01:19:47,858
Get back into position.
...heading towards
Las Vegas. Hit up.

1429
01:19:47,930 --> 01:19:50,194
Light me up every track
you've got. Let's go.

1430
01:19:50,265 --> 01:19:53,325
Let's go, let's go!
Let's keep going here!
Let's keep working!

1431
01:19:53,402 --> 01:19:54,960
ID, what do you got?
All right,

1432
01:19:55,037 --> 01:19:57,665
he's off-course,
he's deviated,
and we don't know why.

1433
01:19:57,739 --> 01:20:00,333
Confirmed.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

1434
01:20:00,409 --> 01:20:01,706
Confirmed hijackings.

1435
01:20:01,777 --> 01:20:04,940
That's the question.
What are we going to do now?

1436
01:20:05,013 --> 01:20:07,243
<i>There's a lot of confusion</i>
<i>here at the Pentagon.</i>
<i>It appears that</i>

1437
01:20:07,816 --> 01:20:11,684
<i>something hit the Pentagon</i>
<i>on the outside of</i>
<i>the fifth corridor,</i>

1438
01:20:11,753 --> 01:20:13,186
<i>on the Army corridor.</i>

1439
01:20:13,255 --> 01:20:17,351
<i>Several Army officers</i>
<i>I talked to reported</i>
<i>hearing a big explosion.</i>

1440
01:20:17,759 --> 01:20:19,920
Listen, I'm not taking
any more chances.

1441
01:20:19,995 --> 01:20:21,986
We got stuff flying around
we have no control over.

1442
01:20:22,064 --> 01:20:25,556
And I don't want a board full
of these planes hitting every
building on the East Coast.

1443
01:20:25,634 --> 01:20:28,728
This is a national emergency.
Everyone lands, regardless
of destination.

1444
01:20:28,804 --> 01:20:30,032
That's gonna cost billions.

1445
01:20:30,105 --> 01:20:31,129
Just do it!

1446
01:20:31,206 --> 01:20:32,901
We have hundreds
of international flights
coming in.

1447
01:20:32,975 --> 01:20:34,340
They're already in the air.

1448
01:20:34,409 --> 01:20:37,401
No. No, I don't want any more
international flights crossing
the borders.

1449
01:20:37,479 --> 01:20:39,071
They'll have to go back
where they came from.

1450
01:20:39,148 --> 01:20:40,843
Nobody's coming into
the country from now on.

1451
01:20:40,916 --> 01:20:42,213
Everyone?
Everyone.

1452
01:20:42,284 --> 01:20:45,378
Shut off the East Coast.
Shut off all the
internationals from Europe.

1453
01:20:45,454 --> 01:20:47,945
Shut off South America,
shut off the West Coast,

1454
01:20:48,023 --> 01:20:49,320
nothing over the top, either.

1455
01:20:49,391 --> 01:20:50,289
We're gonna call Canada
on that?

1456
01:20:50,359 --> 01:20:51,383
Yeah, Canada, too.

1457
01:20:51,460 --> 01:20:52,620
We're gonna shut down
the airspace.

1458
01:20:52,694 --> 01:20:53,888
No, I can't exempt anybody.

1459
01:20:53,962 --> 01:20:55,361
Nobody comes in,
and nobody takes off.

1460
01:20:55,430 --> 01:20:57,227
Land them all.
Take a moment.
Think about this.

1461
01:20:57,299 --> 01:20:59,267
We're gonna shut down
the entire country right now?

1462
01:20:59,334 --> 01:21:01,859
That's right.
Listen, we're at war
with someone,

1463
01:21:01,937 --> 01:21:05,304
and until we figure out
what to do about it,
we're shutting down.

1464
01:21:05,374 --> 01:21:06,898
That's it. We're finished.

01:21:17,186 --> 01:21:19,154
I don't know what to do.

1468
01:21:20,856 --> 01:21:22,517
Does anybody know
about the pilot yet?

1469
01:21:22,591 --> 01:21:23,990
They don't know.

1470
01:21:24,059 --> 01:21:25,686
No. They don't know.

1471
01:21:28,163 --> 01:21:29,255
What?

1472
01:21:31,233 --> 01:21:34,691
Two planes hit
the World Trade Center.

1473
01:21:36,071 --> 01:21:37,129
What?

1474
01:21:37,206 --> 01:21:40,334
In New York.
The World Trade Center.
Two planes.

1475
01:21:41,577 --> 01:21:45,377
My wife says that there
was an explosion at
the World Trade Center.

1476
01:21:45,447 --> 01:21:46,812
What did he say?

1477
01:21:46,882 --> 01:21:50,818
Tell the stewardesses
two planes hit
the World Trade Center.

1478
01:21:50,886 --> 01:21:52,979
Two planes hit the World Trade
Center. Tell the stewardesses.

1479
01:21:53,055 --> 01:21:54,147
What about the five planes?

1480
01:21:54,223 --> 01:21:55,417
Someone pass that back.

1481
01:21:55,490 --> 01:21:56,650
(SHUSHING)
Just a second. Right.

1482
01:21:56,725 --> 01:21:59,956
It doesn't make sense.
Are you sure you heard
that right?

1483

Two planes just hit
the World Trade Center.

1484

1489
01:22:13,942 --> 01:22:15,671
I don't know. I didn't hear.

1490
01:22:16,311 --> 01:22:17,539

Yeah, it's on the news, yeah.

Where are you guys
hearing this?

1493
01:22:20,749 --> 01:22:23,240
Somebody from up there
said it. Ask up there.

1494
01:22:23,318 --> 01:22:26,014
Sandy, take her back,
take her back.

1495
01:22:26,888 --> 01:22:27,877
It's airplanes.

the World Trade Center?

1497
01:22:30,325 --> 01:22:33,192
One after the other
hit the World Trade Center.

1498
01:22:33,262 --> 01:22:35,628
Lyzzie, is it... It's planes.
It's not a bomb.

1499
01:22:35,697 --> 01:22:37,358
It's two airplanes.
It's not a bomb.

1500

It's airplanes.
What?

1501
01:22:39,134 --> 01:22:40,829
It's one after the other.

hit the World Trade Center.

the other, hit

He said it was
on the news?

1507
01:22:50,746 --> 01:22:51,906
I'm on line with my wife.

1508
01:22:51,980 --> 01:22:54,676
Are you hearing this?
What'd they say?

1509
01:22:54,750 --> 01:22:58,151
Two planes hit the World
Trade Center. Is that right?

1510
01:22:59,554 --> 01:23:01,146
Do they mean
prop planes?

1511
01:23:01,223 --> 01:23:02,986
Whose planes?
What airline?

1512
01:23:03,058 --> 01:23:04,525
Is it United?

Okay, sweetie, I will call
you back, I promise.

Two planes have hit
the World Trade Center.

There are five jets
that have been hijacked.

Lyzzie, not the Trade Center,
right? But the...

1519
01:23:22,878 --> 01:23:25,574
Into the Pentagon.
It's on the news.

a bomb onboard this plane?

Yeah, that guy in front
of you said he didn't
think it was real.

I know. That's what
I think, too.

onboard this plane?

I love them, too. Bye, honey.

might have a pilot.
They said there's
a pilot onboard!

What? Who? Who?

1662
01:31:07,108 --> 01:31:09,406
Which one?
This guy right here.

I mean, I'll try.

get you up there.

we've gotta do something
right now.

Come on!

1673

Now, we're gonna take you up
to the front of the plane.

1674

Okay. If you can
get me in there,

land it, but I need a lot
of help from the ground.

talk you down. I did eight
years ATC.

Okay.
You did? Listen.

1678
01:31:42,844 --> 01:31:45,312
When you get me in there,
you've gotta get ahold
of the controls,

1679
01:31:45,380 --> 01:31:48,008
because if he does anything
sudden, we don't have
enough room,

1680
01:31:48,082 --> 01:31:51,813
to pull out of it.
Okay? You gotta get
him off the controls.

I don't know.

1682

right? I mean, he's all
over the place.

01:32:00,862 --> 01:32:01,886
We are alone up here.

1686
01:32:01,963 --> 01:32:05,330
Nobody is going to help us.
We've got to do it. Okay?

1687

1688
01:32:17,378 --> 01:32:18,367

that you'll call my family?
