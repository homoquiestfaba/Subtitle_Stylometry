1
00:00:46,946 --> 00:00:51,088
You want to take the wheel, Sade?

2
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:55,327
Sade.

3
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:41,478
Housekeeping.

4
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:57,295
It's a little early.

5
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:01,532
You're lucky it's just me.

6
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:04,296
Could be my ass.

7
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:06,394
Do you know who I am?

8
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:09,269
Yeah.

9
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:13,778
You're the T-man.
"I'm Gonna Make You Nine."

10
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:16,006
You're Trucker.

11
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:18,071
Your turn.

12
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:21,351
I'm Sadie Flood.

13
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:26,387
I sing.

14
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:29,950
- This is great.
- This is my happy home.

15
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,189
My retreat from care.

16
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:35,756
There's a place for everything
and everything's in its place.

17
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:39,360
It's how I keep track.
You understand?

18
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:42,770
Who are you expecting?

19
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:36,616
What you think you were doin'?

20
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:40,397
You need to do what I tell ya.

21
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:43,696
- What?
- If we gonna go this journey,

22
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,729
I don't mean for you
to look at, talk to...

23
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:51,469
Or fraternize.

24
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:54,808
My sidemen got friends.
They don't need friends.

25
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:56,813
You with me.

26
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:00,317
Respect it.

27
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:11,157
Hello, Chasman.

28
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:13,163
Howya doin'?

29
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:18,327
Great. I'm great.
This is great. How are you?

30
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:21,438
That's so great.

31
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:46,663
I guess I'm gonna
have to kill you.

32
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:52,396
Joke, Sadie. Blanks.

33
00:05:40,393 --> 00:05:42,100
We're here.

34
00:05:53,306 --> 00:05:55,479
Where's the cat?

35
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:57,578
Bummen

36
00:09:53,512 --> 00:09:56,516
Stephen Fasten 1859.

37
00:09:58,384 --> 00:10:01,126
Whoo! Whoo!

38
00:10:04,456 --> 00:10:06,402
Thank you.

39
00:10:50,636 --> 00:10:53,947
We've been trying out
some new songs.

40
00:10:54,006 --> 00:10:58,148
- I knew you'd be here.
- I didn't know I'd be here.

41
00:10:59,612 --> 00:11:02,422
Well, I felt you out there.

42
00:11:02,481 --> 00:11:05,826
Hey, Mish is here.
Did you see Mish?

43
00:11:05,885 --> 00:11:09,128
Andrew's asleep in the dressing room.
He'll wander out in a minute.

44
00:11:09,188 --> 00:11:12,294
God, you look amazing.
Well, you always look amazing.

45
00:11:12,358 --> 00:11:15,931
- I look like shit Jake.
- No, not to me. Never.

46
00:11:15,995 --> 00:11:18,305
-This is Chasman.
- Hiya.

47
00:11:18,364 --> 00:11:20,901
-This is Jake.
- Best man in the world.

48
00:11:20,966 --> 00:11:23,173
Hiya.

49
00:11:23,235 --> 00:11:25,875
Uh, could I get you
somethin' to eat?

50
00:11:25,938 --> 00:11:29,044
- How you doin' Sadie?
- No thanks, Jake.

51
00:11:29,108 --> 00:11:32,248
- Incredible out there tonight, huh?
- Pretty intense.

52
00:11:32,311 --> 00:11:34,814
- So how you doin'?
- Great.

53
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,224
Heard you were with the Trucker.
That true?

54
00:11:37,283 --> 00:11:40,628
For about half a second.
You heard that?

55
00:11:40,686 --> 00:11:43,895
- He's my man, you know.
- You heard that, huh?

56
00:11:56,168 --> 00:11:59,581
Oh, God. God.

57
00:12:00,806 --> 00:12:02,945
Good to see you.

58
00:12:03,008 --> 00:12:05,318
You were great out there, man.

59
00:12:05,377 --> 00:12:08,881
So in-fucking-credibly great.

60
00:12:08,948 --> 00:12:11,019
You tear me up, you know?

61
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:14,462
What did Dad used to say?
God kissed her.

62
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:18,935
- God kissed that girl.
- God, I'm glad you're here.

63
00:12:21,093 --> 00:12:23,039
Well.

64
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:27,170
-Well. - Hey, Mish.
- Hey.

65
00:12:27,232 --> 00:12:29,337
- I get a hug?
- Sure.

66
00:12:29,401 --> 00:12:31,403
- You don't have to.
- No, sure.

67
00:12:34,073 --> 00:12:36,019
That was great.

68
00:12:37,176 --> 00:12:39,281
So, are you drinking?

69
00:12:39,345 --> 00:12:41,951
You know me.
Whatever’s cheap or free.

70
00:12:45,017 --> 00:12:47,190
So you're here in Seattle?

71
00:12:47,252 --> 00:12:50,426
- Looks like it.
- Hello.

72
00:12:50,489 --> 00:12:52,935
-This is Chasman.
-Hi.

73
00:12:52,992 --> 00:12:55,404
- He's with me.
-Oh?

74
00:12:55,461 --> 00:12:58,203
Came up from San Francisco.
Saved my life.

75
00:12:58,263 --> 00:13:00,243
- Oh.
- Hello.

76
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:04,008
I'm a fan.
So Sadie said you were her sister.

77
00:13:04,069 --> 00:13:06,948
- Chasman's a promoter.
- Oh.

78
00:13:07,006 --> 00:13:10,112
- What do you promote?
- Me.

79
00:13:10,175 --> 00:13:14,123
Sadie's among my clients.
Yeah, my star client.

80
00:13:14,179 --> 00:13:16,682
I met Sadie in San Francisco.

81
00:13:16,749 --> 00:13:19,059
- I'm from London originally.
- Oh?

82
00:13:19,118 --> 00:13:23,089
Baland.
You can hear the accent.

83
00:13:23,155 --> 00:13:27,900
- Where you staying? -Well, I thought, you
know, I'd come home for a little maybe.

84
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,338
Oh, that'd be great.

85
00:13:30,396 --> 00:13:33,707
- Ferguson heard you were with Trucker.
- Emmett Trucker?

86
00:13:33,766 --> 00:13:37,908
I'm-gonna-make-you-mine Trucker.
Yeah. For about half a minute.

87
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:42,476
- Yeah. - You were great.
You were great tonight.

88
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:44,885
- What you do up there.
- Thank you.

89
00:13:44,943 --> 00:13:48,413
- I know you think that
sounds like bullshit - No.

90
00:13:49,481 --> 00:13:51,893
We're staying in town tonight.

91
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:54,521
- Let us get you a room at the hotel.
- Unless you--

92
00:13:54,586 --> 00:13:57,726
- That'd be great. - So you were
thinking of staying with us a little.

93
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:01,431
- Until I got settled.
- Uh, that's fantastic.

94
00:14:01,493 --> 00:14:04,736
- I could help with the house.
- Well, maybe not.

95
00:14:04,797 --> 00:14:07,744
- Has someone got an eye on Andrew?
- Andrew's fine.

96
00:14:10,569 --> 00:14:13,709
- Miss, you wanna go see to Andrew?
- Sure.

97
00:14:13,772 --> 00:14:15,718
- See you, Sadie.
- You bet!

98
00:14:16,842 --> 00:14:18,879
What are your plans?

99
00:14:18,944 --> 00:14:21,356
-Chasman.
- He's gotta go back.

100
00:14:21,413 --> 00:14:23,359
- Not tonight.
- No, not tonight.

101
00:14:23,415 --> 00:14:25,361
Not tomorrow maybe neither.

102
00:14:25,417 --> 00:14:29,388
- It's along ride.
- Well, we'll see, won't we?

103
00:14:29,455 --> 00:14:33,631
- There's tons of food over there.
- Can I fix you a plate?

104
00:14:33,692 --> 00:14:36,195
Well, I was thinking
of you guys, actually.

105
00:15:25,444 --> 00:15:27,788
I mean, it fired loud.

106
00:15:27,846 --> 00:15:29,985
But I didn't get hit by anything.

107
00:15:30,048 --> 00:15:32,153
He had guns everywhere.

108
00:15:32,217 --> 00:15:34,788
He just always thinks
people are doin' him in.

109
00:15:34,853 --> 00:15:38,494
- So he's always expecting,
like, a siege. - Mish?

110
00:15:38,557 --> 00:15:43,597
So everybody's out to get you.
And also... germs.

111
00:15:43,662 --> 00:15:45,938
He has a thing about germs.

112
00:15:45,998 --> 00:15:49,844
And the faucet had to be
right in the middle of the sink...

113
00:15:49,902 --> 00:15:52,348
Or his life was ruined.

114
00:15:52,404 --> 00:15:55,044
- Come on, you guys.
- You want me to take 'em?

115
00:15:55,107 --> 00:15:57,087
- No, I'll take'em.
- Well, Sadie's here.

116
00:15:57,142 --> 00:16:01,056
- I'll take'em. Andrew!
- Is there brown sugar?

117
00:16:01,113 --> 00:16:03,923
And he would do
these midnight raids...

118
00:16:03,982 --> 00:16:07,486
Where he would look through the
cupboards to see if I'd eaten anything.

119
00:16:07,553 --> 00:16:11,194
- Mish.
- Are there any grapes?

120
00:16:11,256 --> 00:16:13,566
He's definitely
multiple personalities.

121
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:17,630
I mean there were
three main ones,

122
00:16:17,696 --> 00:16:21,542
and two were very mean.

123
00:16:23,001 --> 00:16:26,175
And then there were,
like, subgroups.

124
00:16:27,506 --> 00:16:29,577
There you go, Druid.

125
00:16:29,641 --> 00:16:32,781
He'd roll a joint big as cigars.

126
00:16:32,844 --> 00:16:34,881
He was real nice
when he smoked.

127
00:16:34,947 --> 00:16:40,625
He'd became really mellow. He could smoke
two huge spliffs and still sing great.

128
00:16:42,187 --> 00:16:45,134
And you know,
he can be so wonderful.

129
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:48,501
He can be
such a fabulous singer.

130
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:53,100
He has great vocal range,
great breath control.

131
00:16:53,165 --> 00:16:56,874
You guys have about 20 minutes
before you have to be out that door.

132
00:17:04,643 --> 00:17:08,147
That woman can sure as hell sing.

133
00:17:08,213 --> 00:17:10,955
As opposed to what?

134
00:17:13,051 --> 00:17:17,932
Did I say something?
I didn't mean anything by it, Jake.

135
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:19,936
Everything's Jake.
Jake.

136
00:17:22,394 --> 00:17:26,274
- Is she gonna stay?
- Don't know.

137
00:17:36,241 --> 00:17:38,243
Mish, you're gonna
ruin your eyes.

138
00:17:51,957 --> 00:17:54,267
What are you doin'?

139
00:17:54,326 --> 00:17:56,397
It's 8:00 in the morning.

140
00:17:58,497 --> 00:18:01,910
You need not to do that
around the kids, okay?

141
00:18:03,402 --> 00:18:05,348
Wouldn't.

142
00:18:07,306 --> 00:18:10,412
I don't need to say
I'm grateful I'm here.

143
00:18:10,475 --> 00:18:12,421
No, Sadie.

144
00:18:14,713 --> 00:18:18,024
- How was the tour?
- It was great.

145
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:21,553
- I wasn't on the tour.
-Oh?

146
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:24,362
- I don't manage the band anymore.
-No?

147
00:18:24,423 --> 00:18:27,563
Not for six years, Sadie.

148
00:18:27,626 --> 00:18:30,129
You don't know
what the hell I do, do you?

149
00:18:30,195 --> 00:18:33,540
I do. Sure I do.

150
00:18:33,598 --> 00:18:35,544
You are so fucked.

151
00:18:36,635 --> 00:18:38,581
I do.

152
00:18:39,871 --> 00:18:43,216
I teach and I write.

153
00:18:43,275 --> 00:18:47,314
- I knew that.
- I wanna start workin' the farm.

154
00:18:47,379 --> 00:18:49,450
I like doin' stuff
with my hands.

155
00:18:52,317 --> 00:18:55,059
They think they own her.

156
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,397
I'd be walkin' around, makin' sure the
sound was good and everything's fine,

157
00:18:58,457 --> 00:19:00,596
and I've had guys go,

158
00:19:00,659 --> 00:19:03,139
"Hey, you with the band?

159
00:19:03,195 --> 00:19:05,436
God, I'd like to fuck her"

160
00:19:05,497 --> 00:19:08,910
You know you gotta bland it off.
You know?

161
00:19:10,135 --> 00:19:12,081
See, we've been through it.

162
00:19:13,372 --> 00:19:17,286
She slept with somebody
so I slept with somebody...

163
00:19:17,342 --> 00:19:20,812
Or we thought we were
gonna sleep with somebody.

164
00:19:20,879 --> 00:19:23,257
The fights are one thing,
but the sex--

165
00:19:27,052 --> 00:19:31,933
We hurt each other. We've done
just about every lie there is.

166
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:36,461
Sometimes I am amazed
that somehow we're still here.

167
00:19:36,528 --> 00:19:40,408
And all I can think about
is that I fell in love with her...

168
00:19:40,465 --> 00:19:43,036
The moment I laid eyes on her.

169
00:19:43,101 --> 00:19:45,206
She's Georgia you know?

170
00:19:46,438 --> 00:19:49,180
And we’re gonna grow old together

171
00:20:05,724 --> 00:20:09,934
- I stripped the beds.
- You didn't need to do that.

172
00:20:09,995 --> 00:20:13,204
-Yeah, well, sure, I did.
- It's pouring Sadie.

173
00:20:13,265 --> 00:20:16,838
And you hang them out.
How dumb to forget.

174
00:20:16,902 --> 00:20:18,848
Well, no harm done.

175
00:20:24,342 --> 00:20:27,084
I borrowed this, okay?

176
00:20:27,145 --> 00:20:31,355
Whatever. It's fine. You don't need
to clean the house, Sadie.

177
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:33,418
I was cleaning motel rooms.

178
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,432
Really. No, really!

179
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:44,402
Oh, God.
Sadie reduced to that.

180
00:20:44,463 --> 00:20:47,307
Or is there anything Sadie
can't be reduced to?

181
00:20:47,365 --> 00:20:50,312
- You wanna give me a break, Sadie?
- You wanna give me one?

182
00:20:50,368 --> 00:20:52,439
I can feel what you're feeling.

183
00:20:52,504 --> 00:20:55,007
No. No, you can't.

184
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:59,852
You can't feel what I'm feeling.
You aren't me.

185
00:20:59,911 --> 00:21:02,187
I think we should not
get into this.

186
00:21:08,353 --> 00:21:10,833
Fine. Better for me.

187
00:21:10,889 --> 00:21:12,960
Shit.

188
00:21:20,499 --> 00:21:24,208
Dad's coming
to stay a week, Friday.

189
00:21:26,004 --> 00:21:28,644
- I'll be here.
- Gets really tense Sadie.

190
00:21:28,707 --> 00:21:30,709
I'll be here, okay?

191
00:21:34,646 --> 00:21:39,425
- How's he doin'?
- Fine.

192
00:21:39,484 --> 00:21:41,691
I think fine.

193
00:21:41,753 --> 00:21:43,699
I think all right.

194
00:21:48,026 --> 00:21:50,302
You need some money?

195
00:21:52,397 --> 00:21:56,209
Yeah. Yeah.
Somethin' to get started on.

196
00:21:57,435 --> 00:21:59,472
I'm good for it.

197
00:21:59,538 --> 00:22:01,779
I don't want you
to be good for it.

198
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:06,186
It pleases me to be able to give it to you.
I love being able to give it to you.

199
00:22:06,244 --> 00:22:08,554
Okay.

200
00:22:08,613 --> 00:22:12,561
Things are gonna break for me.
There is not a doubt in my mind.

201
00:22:12,617 --> 00:22:14,824
This has all gotta be
about something.

202
00:22:14,886 --> 00:22:17,992
This whole... adventure.

203
00:22:18,056 --> 00:22:21,299
Everything is stored
for later use.

204
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:23,305
There must be a pony.

205
00:23:29,361 --> 00:23:31,500
Thank you.

206
00:23:31,563 --> 00:23:35,443
We're gonna take a little break.
Buy a pitcher of beer. We like the gig.

207
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:44,286
Whatever he's drinkin',
I'm buyin'.

208
00:23:44,342 --> 00:23:46,652
- You want another round?
- No.

209
00:23:50,682 --> 00:23:53,390
- Nice dress.
- It's Georgia's.

210
00:23:54,552 --> 00:23:57,897
I hear you’re lookin'
for a backup singer.

211
00:23:57,956 --> 00:24:01,130
- And where'd you hear that?
-I made it up.

212
00:24:01,192 --> 00:24:03,138
Come on, Bobby.

213
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:07,735
I want two solos.

214
00:24:09,634 --> 00:24:12,478
Come on, Bobby.
We were good together.

215
00:24:17,609 --> 00:24:20,055
Leland's still with you.
And Paul.

216
00:24:22,213 --> 00:24:24,159
You wanna sit in?

217
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:27,796
Yeah.

218
00:24:30,555 --> 00:24:33,900
- How was San Francisco?
- Had a few gigs.

219
00:24:33,958 --> 00:24:37,428
- Got myself a manager.
-Yeah?

220
00:24:37,495 --> 00:24:40,032
You had a gig with Trucker.

221
00:24:40,098 --> 00:24:42,100
Yeah. Unreal.

222
00:24:45,537 --> 00:24:49,144
Wanna welcome a good friend,
Georgia's baby sister.

223
00:24:49,207 --> 00:24:52,484
Sadie Flood!
Come on you all! Give it up!

224
00:24:56,047 --> 00:24:57,993
"Almost Blue."

225
00:24:58,049 --> 00:25:01,462
Hi.

226
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:04,363
- Hi.
- Comrade.

227
00:27:39,577 --> 00:27:41,887
- Okay
- Thank you.

228
00:27:51,422 --> 00:27:54,528
I forgot how much
I love this place.

229
00:27:56,194 --> 00:27:58,231
Only a couple of days, Sadie.
That's it.

230
00:27:58,296 --> 00:28:00,298
Scout's honor.

231
00:28:00,365 --> 00:28:03,869
If we take you on,
the first time you fuck us over--

232
00:28:03,935 --> 00:28:07,109
- I'm not gonna fuck you over.
- 'Cause the band's doin' okay.

233
00:28:07,171 --> 00:28:09,082
I'm not going
to fuck you over, Bobby.

234
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:12,280
You snow up standing up.
Both.

235
00:28:15,513 --> 00:28:17,857
You've been outta my life, Sadie.

236
00:28:19,617 --> 00:28:22,621
I don't want you back in,
not like before.

237
00:28:22,687 --> 00:28:24,792
Yeah, I know.

238
00:28:24,856 --> 00:28:29,066
It's okay. Don't shit where you eat.
It's top of the list.

239
00:28:29,127 --> 00:28:32,131
Sadie, with the makeup?
A hairless of everything.

240
00:28:33,364 --> 00:28:35,901
You're the boss.

241
00:28:35,967 --> 00:28:39,437
- Did you fuck him?
-Who?

242
00:28:39,504 --> 00:28:42,849
- Trucker.
- No.

243
00:29:38,129 --> 00:29:40,439
Supposed to rain tomorrow.

244
00:29:40,498 --> 00:29:43,069
Nobody answer the phone!

245
00:29:45,403 --> 00:29:47,349
See you guys.

246
00:30:11,496 --> 00:30:13,442
Which ones mellon?

247
00:30:15,733 --> 00:30:18,509
- Me. - What, nobody answers
their phone anymore?

248
00:30:18,569 --> 00:30:22,176
- Do you think you're gonna play in this?
- Hey, we got a gig, we show up.

249
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,186
Yeah, right.

250
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:29,548
We love you, Seattle!

251
00:31:16,661 --> 00:31:18,641
We'll be back in 15.

252
00:31:27,872 --> 00:31:31,319
Great song. You're great!

253
00:31:32,477 --> 00:31:34,354
Okay, pal, you too.

254
00:31:38,616 --> 00:31:40,789
- What'd you have Sadie?
- It was blow.

255
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:46,232
- I would've took it.
- I offered, Herman.

256
00:31:47,892 --> 00:31:51,271
- Was I there?
-Yeah, Herman.

257
00:31:52,997 --> 00:31:57,139
- Wow.
- What do you want with blow, Herman?

258
00:31:57,201 --> 00:32:00,944
- What'd you do with it?
-I flushed it.

259
00:32:02,773 --> 00:32:04,844
I wish you'd have asked.

260
00:32:07,612 --> 00:32:09,751
You know where you are, Herman?

261
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:14,426
We're in a fucking bowling alley.

262
00:32:17,155 --> 00:32:21,001
- You got a way home?
- Yeah. Leland.

263
00:32:33,404 --> 00:32:35,475
- Delivery.
- Yeah!

264
00:32:43,848 --> 00:32:47,159
- Thanks. - Uh, Mr. Bruno had me
stop at the liquor store on the way.

265
00:32:47,218 --> 00:32:51,360
Mr. Bruno's a great man.

266
00:32:51,422 --> 00:32:53,402
How much do I owe you?

267
00:32:53,457 --> 00:32:56,870
Um, groceries are $4.53,

268
00:32:56,928 --> 00:32:58,908
and the liquoris...

269
00:33:00,231 --> 00:33:02,438
$36.60.

270
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,446
Come in.

271
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:08,416
Gotta take those down.

272
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:15,954
Whew.

273
00:33:16,013 --> 00:33:20,120
Never get a chance
to pick up, you know?

274
00:33:20,184 --> 00:33:23,631
Days just... phew.
Get away from me.

275
00:33:27,124 --> 00:33:30,105
That's $41.13.

276
00:33:40,438 --> 00:33:44,511
-Are you all right?
- What? Yeah, I'm okay.

277
00:33:44,575 --> 00:33:46,646
I mean, I'm not
a maniac or anything.

278
00:34:04,629 --> 00:34:06,575
And there's
a little something for you.

279
00:34:06,631 --> 00:34:10,169
- Hey, you know, I don't-- I don't feel
right about that. - Well, it's not a lot.

280
00:34:10,234 --> 00:34:14,979
- I'd like you to have it.
- I know who you are.

281
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:17,315
Yeah?

282
00:34:17,375 --> 00:34:20,879
- Well, I try to catch you.
- Well, I'm glad you're out there.

283
00:34:20,945 --> 00:34:23,482
No, I do, whenever you--

284
00:34:25,016 --> 00:34:27,087
I think you're great.

285
00:34:27,151 --> 00:34:29,392
"Only Blue"?

286
00:34:29,453 --> 00:34:31,399
- "Almost Blue"
- Yeah.

287
00:34:31,455 --> 00:34:33,526
That's a great song.

288
00:34:34,925 --> 00:34:37,769
Well, that's Mr. Costello.

289
00:34:38,896 --> 00:34:42,036
I don't know.
Everything you do--

290
00:34:42,099 --> 00:34:44,443
Guess I'm makin'
a perfect ass of myself

291
00:34:45,936 --> 00:34:48,246
Yeah, I guess so.

292
00:34:51,842 --> 00:34:54,789
What would you think
if I sort of hung out?

293
00:34:55,946 --> 00:34:59,120
You know, like
hung out with you.

294
00:34:59,183 --> 00:35:03,188
Made myself useful.
I could do that.

295
00:35:03,254 --> 00:35:06,064
I don't know what
you're talking about.

296
00:35:06,123 --> 00:35:10,697
Wouldn't have to be--
You know, I mean, that's not why.

297
00:35:12,363 --> 00:35:15,173
Then why?

298
00:35:15,232 --> 00:35:18,008
I didn't mean to offend you.

299
00:35:18,069 --> 00:35:20,015
I have the highest
respect for you.

300
00:35:20,071 --> 00:35:25,145
I have beer brought up to have the
highest respect for women. Very much so.

301
00:35:30,748 --> 00:35:33,661
- How old are you?
- Twenty-three.

302
00:35:37,321 --> 00:35:39,927
- What's your name?
- Axel.

303
00:35:40,991 --> 00:35:44,461
Well, I'm gonna have
a drink, Axel.

304
00:35:44,528 --> 00:35:46,667
Would you like one?

305
00:35:46,731 --> 00:35:48,677
Don't drink.

306
00:35:51,435 --> 00:35:54,348
You're a very nice person, Axel.

307
00:35:54,405 --> 00:35:56,282
Thank you.

308
00:40:17,534 --> 00:40:20,378
- Sorry hon.
- It's all right, Bobby.

309
00:40:22,406 --> 00:40:24,682
Why'd you leave me Bobby?

310
00:40:24,742 --> 00:40:27,518
She's not gonna get sick
in the Rabbit, is she?

311
00:40:29,913 --> 00:40:34,157
It's the fuckin' Nyquil, man.
Don't get pissed at me.

312
00:40:34,218 --> 00:40:37,529
Don't get sick in the Rabbit,
okay, Sadie?

313
00:40:37,588 --> 00:40:41,400
She just slid down the wall, you know?
Passed out. Nothin' major.

314
00:40:48,232 --> 00:40:50,872
To your right.

315
00:40:50,934 --> 00:40:52,880
I'm with her.

316
00:40:58,676 --> 00:41:01,987
You know I love you, Bobby.

317
00:41:02,046 --> 00:41:05,721
'Cause you taught me to listen
to the bottom. Bass and drums, man.

318
00:41:05,783 --> 00:41:09,788
-Shut up, Sadie.
- Don't play it. Don't lie it.

319
00:41:09,853 --> 00:41:13,027
If you're gonna do it, be it.
Try it.

320
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:15,832
Don't you wish
you'd said it, Sadie?

321
00:41:15,893 --> 00:41:19,466
Don't cut me loose, Bobby.
I'll disappear.

322
00:41:21,131 --> 00:41:25,079
- Do yourself a favor.
- What kind of thing is that to say?

323
00:41:25,135 --> 00:41:29,481
- You used to be able to get my
clothes off. -Shut up, Sadie.

324
00:41:32,576 --> 00:41:34,522
Shit.

325
00:41:40,684 --> 00:41:42,857
You know what, Sadie?

326
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:47,096
- Got the flu, Bobby.
- It's true man. She's burnin' up.

327
00:41:47,157 --> 00:41:51,867
I told her, you know, she shouldn't mess
around, but she had the gig and everything.

328
00:41:56,967 --> 00:42:00,915
So I think it's okay
to deliver groceries.

329
00:42:00,971 --> 00:42:04,043
You know.
I've done a lot of things.

330
00:42:04,108 --> 00:42:06,088
I've done a lot worse.

331
00:42:06,143 --> 00:42:08,453
But I have my whole life
ahead of me.

332
00:42:09,847 --> 00:42:13,624
My love is cars.
I fix vintage cars.

333
00:42:13,684 --> 00:42:17,427
I think there's where my future is.
Very much so.

334
00:42:17,488 --> 00:42:20,958
- You take me seriously?
- Yeah.

335
00:42:21,024 --> 00:42:22,970
I do, Axel.

336
00:42:25,929 --> 00:42:29,103
I'm young but I know what love is.

337
00:42:30,467 --> 00:42:32,504
I miss love.

338
00:42:32,569 --> 00:42:34,515
I miss it.

339
00:42:36,974 --> 00:42:39,011
I had a really great lady.

340
00:42:40,978 --> 00:42:43,356
She gave up everything for me.

341
00:42:43,413 --> 00:42:45,359
She followed me to Chicago.

342
00:42:45,415 --> 00:42:47,861
We lived there together two years.

343
00:42:47,918 --> 00:42:49,920
Twenty-four hours a day.

344
00:42:52,089 --> 00:42:54,365
Then one day, she said, "That's it.

345
00:42:55,893 --> 00:42:58,396
We aren't anymore?"

346
00:42:58,462 --> 00:43:01,409
She went back to Minnesota.
I never heard from her again.

347
00:43:01,465 --> 00:43:03,775
I'm sorry, Axel.

348
00:43:03,834 --> 00:43:06,747
See, I know if
it's really love that...

349
00:43:08,672 --> 00:43:11,516
You try to work it out
if it's goin' wrong.

350
00:43:13,844 --> 00:43:15,881
So maybe it wasn't love.

351
00:43:18,482 --> 00:43:22,692
I had these goals about gettin' to know myself
better so I'm not so dependent on love.

352
00:43:24,555 --> 00:43:27,229
There's a lot of unkindness
in the world.

353
00:43:27,291 --> 00:43:31,137
You know your--
your life, your day?

354
00:43:31,195 --> 00:43:36,269
They could be the most important part.
One day could be the most important thing in your life.

355
00:43:36,333 --> 00:43:38,279
You'd never know it.

356
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:43,840
I think, you know,
you're good for me.

357
00:43:46,043 --> 00:43:50,788
I walk into a club, and there's
this beautiful girl smilin' at me.

358
00:43:50,848 --> 00:43:52,885
Singin' to me.

359
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:55,430
And these shinin'
eyes... at me.

360
00:43:57,654 --> 00:43:59,600
She makes me real.

361
00:43:59,656 --> 00:44:02,762
She gives me reality... so,

362
00:44:04,528 --> 00:44:06,474
I'm in love.

363
00:44:36,193 --> 00:44:38,332
- Whoo!
- Thank you very much.

364
00:44:45,402 --> 00:44:48,542
- Well, I'm glad you made it.
- I had to see you.

365
00:44:48,605 --> 00:44:50,607
-This is Axel.
- Hey, Axel.

366
00:44:50,674 --> 00:44:52,620
Hi. That was great.

367
00:44:52,676 --> 00:44:55,452
Yeah, the band was hot tonight.

368
00:44:55,512 --> 00:44:58,618
I want you to give my best to Bobby.
You guys are workin'.

369
00:44:58,682 --> 00:45:00,628
Doin' good, yeah.

370
00:45:00,684 --> 00:45:03,221
Hey, you know who came by
the backstage? Georgia.

371
00:45:03,287 --> 00:45:06,097
Really? When?

372
00:45:06,156 --> 00:45:08,830
It was Wednesday.
We were workin' Wednesday and Thursday.

373
00:45:08,892 --> 00:45:11,133
Yeah, it was Wednesday.

374
00:45:11,194 --> 00:45:14,607
Did I just screw around
with a can of worms here?

375
00:45:14,665 --> 00:45:19,307
- No. - 'Cause if it's open,
you know, I'll step in it.

376
00:45:19,369 --> 00:45:22,043
- You know we opened for Georgia.
- I heard.

377
00:45:22,105 --> 00:45:25,643
Yeah. In Austin and Eugene...

378
00:45:25,709 --> 00:45:27,655
And Winnipeg.

379
00:45:27,711 --> 00:45:31,750
So she came by, and they were
just comin' off the ceiling.

380
00:45:33,350 --> 00:45:38,026
You know, I don't think she'd feel
too good steppin' in your light.

381
00:45:39,323 --> 00:45:41,325
Fuck you very much, Jo.

382
00:45:59,276 --> 00:46:01,449
I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were in here.

383
00:46:01,511 --> 00:46:04,890
No, come in, Mish.
It's all right.

384
00:46:04,948 --> 00:46:06,894
I was just--

385
00:46:08,185 --> 00:46:10,495
I don't know what I was just.

386
00:46:10,554 --> 00:46:15,003
- Everybody's looking for you.
- Thank you for finding me.

387
00:46:15,058 --> 00:46:17,436
You are so like your mother.

388
00:46:18,695 --> 00:46:20,675
Two peas in a pod.

389
00:46:21,798 --> 00:46:26,372
And your grandfather.
Three peas in a pod.

390
00:46:26,436 --> 00:46:28,939
I'm like my dad, I think.

391
00:46:32,809 --> 00:46:36,154
The table looks great, Mish.

392
00:46:39,383 --> 00:46:41,989
You know what's so good
about us, Georgia?

393
00:46:42,052 --> 00:46:44,464
We're so close.

394
00:46:44,521 --> 00:46:48,697
Growing up, I can't remember
not doing everything together.

395
00:46:50,794 --> 00:46:53,775
- Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

396
00:46:53,830 --> 00:46:56,401
What are you doing
with Axel, Sadie?

397
00:46:56,466 --> 00:46:59,936
- How do you and Dad find so
much to talk about? - We don't.

398
00:47:00,003 --> 00:47:03,177
- We don't talk much.
- I'm going to marry him.

399
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,481
His grandmother's ring.

400
00:47:05,542 --> 00:47:08,489
- And there's only one Jake.
- How old is he, Sadie?

401
00:47:08,545 --> 00:47:11,082
- He loves me.
- I'm gonna stay out of this.

402
00:47:11,148 --> 00:47:14,755
So what is it that happens
between you when you don't talk?

403
00:47:14,818 --> 00:47:17,264
- Leave Dad alone.
- I do.

404
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:19,732
I do. That's what I do.

405
00:47:21,258 --> 00:47:24,262
- Will you come to the wedding?
- Sure. Okay.

406
00:47:24,327 --> 00:47:26,534
- I'm going to do it.
- Fine.

407
00:47:29,699 --> 00:47:33,806
You know I watch you,
and I listen to you.

408
00:47:33,870 --> 00:47:36,646
This gift from God.

409
00:47:36,706 --> 00:47:41,212
And I swell up with
admiration and pride...

410
00:47:41,278 --> 00:47:43,224
And love.

411
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:46,489
And I swear on Mish and Andrew...

412
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:49,258
There's no enemy.

413
00:47:49,319 --> 00:47:51,560
You know, I can't.

414
00:47:53,090 --> 00:47:56,264
And here I am,
not three feet away from you,

415
00:47:56,326 --> 00:47:58,465
and I talk to you...

416
00:47:58,528 --> 00:48:01,668
And I swear, Georgia,
it feels like no one's home.

417
00:48:01,731 --> 00:48:04,109
You disappear on me.

418
00:48:04,167 --> 00:48:07,011
You know what I truly
want for you, Sadie?

419
00:48:07,070 --> 00:48:09,072
I want you to be happy.

420
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,187
You wanna be
trouble-free, Georgia.

421
00:48:13,243 --> 00:48:15,883
Okay. All right.

422
00:48:15,946 --> 00:48:18,187
How you comin' with
the table, Mish?

423
00:48:18,248 --> 00:48:22,321
- Finished. - Why don't you see
if anyone needs anything?

424
00:48:25,989 --> 00:48:28,265
Things are goin' good for me.

425
00:48:28,325 --> 00:48:30,271
I'm glad.

426
00:48:33,663 --> 00:48:36,075
- You know his last name?
- Axel?

427
00:48:37,567 --> 00:48:40,480
- Yeah. Of course.
-Yeah?

428
00:48:40,537 --> 00:48:42,642
Yeah. What do you think?

429
00:48:45,175 --> 00:48:47,519
- You writing?
- Every day.

430
00:48:47,577 --> 00:48:49,853
-Workin' on an album?
- Yes.

431
00:48:49,913 --> 00:48:53,122
I should do some backup.
If you want.

432
00:48:53,183 --> 00:48:55,129
Good idea.

433
00:48:56,453 --> 00:48:59,332
You haven't come to hear me.
Why is that?

434
00:48:59,389 --> 00:49:02,370
- I will if you want.
- It'd be great if you did.

435
00:49:02,425 --> 00:49:05,497
-Well, I will then.
- Okay, great.

436
00:49:05,562 --> 00:49:07,633
I'm interesting, you know?

437
00:49:07,697 --> 00:49:10,371
You were the one with ambition, Sadie.
I never gave a damn.

438
00:49:10,433 --> 00:49:12,743
You say.

439
00:49:12,802 --> 00:49:15,180
You know it's the truth.

440
00:49:15,238 --> 00:49:17,912
Funny how things work out.

441
00:49:17,974 --> 00:49:19,920
Not what I meant.

442
00:49:23,647 --> 00:49:28,596
You know, I let you talk to me this way, and
I manage to make myself think it's okay.

443
00:49:29,653 --> 00:49:32,156
And I'm always glad
you've been here.

444
00:49:32,222 --> 00:49:34,759
And I can't stand it
when you're hurting.

445
00:49:35,625 --> 00:49:38,105
And I've made peace with--

446
00:49:39,396 --> 00:49:41,603
That nothing's enough for you.

447
00:49:44,434 --> 00:49:48,041
I don't want to know what you do locked
away in that bathroom for half an hour.

448
00:49:48,104 --> 00:49:50,380
I don't want my kids to know.

449
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:54,286
I wouldn't do that
in your house, Georgia.

450
00:49:54,344 --> 00:49:56,290
Okay.

451
00:50:02,419 --> 00:50:05,025
This is a wonderful home.

452
00:50:05,088 --> 00:50:07,034
It's very warm.

453
00:50:08,625 --> 00:50:11,435
You must be very happy here.

454
00:50:11,494 --> 00:50:14,168
Sadie and Georgia
grew up in this house.

455
00:50:14,231 --> 00:50:17,235
Georgia bought it
when it came on the market.

456
00:50:20,370 --> 00:50:22,316
How you doin', Dad?

457
00:50:22,372 --> 00:50:26,286
- I'm doin' all right.
- It's good to see you.

458
00:50:26,343 --> 00:50:29,620
You oughta get out more, Dad.

459
00:50:29,679 --> 00:50:33,024
Well, I get out almost more
than I like anymore.

460
00:50:34,517 --> 00:50:36,463
How you doin', Sadie?

461
00:50:36,519 --> 00:50:38,465
I couldn't be better.

462
00:50:39,923 --> 00:50:43,461
- This is your young man?
- Yes.

463
00:50:43,526 --> 00:50:46,336
Good for you.

464
00:50:46,396 --> 00:50:51,971
- Axel delivers groceries.
- I specialize in vintage cars.

465
00:50:52,035 --> 00:50:54,675
So you've given us to understand.

466
00:50:54,738 --> 00:50:57,184
Is that your, uh,
vehicle out there?

467
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:59,811
That's my treasure.
Very much so.

468
00:51:01,177 --> 00:51:04,852
Well, I wish you both
every happiness, Axel.

469
00:51:04,914 --> 00:51:07,326
You're a peach, Dad.

470
00:51:24,901 --> 00:51:27,507
- I meant to do that.
- It doesn't matter.

471
00:51:33,443 --> 00:51:36,720
What do you say
we get married, Axel?

472
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:40,023
Yeah. See, I thought
that's what we were doin'.

473
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:44,856
I've been with
a lot of men, Axel.

474
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:50,294
Is there anyone
I supposed to be approved by?

475
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:55,139
- "Approved by"?
- To meet. Family.

476
00:51:55,198 --> 00:52:00,079
I don't think so. I mean, it's not like
you have to meet 'em right away.

477
00:52:02,038 --> 00:52:04,575
-Axel Goldman, right?
- Yeah.

478
00:52:06,142 --> 00:52:08,144
See. I know it.

479
00:52:41,311 --> 00:52:44,087
Hello. My name
is Sadie Flood.

480
00:52:46,182 --> 00:52:48,287
That's all, my fan.

481
00:52:48,351 --> 00:52:51,264
I got married today.

482
00:52:52,622 --> 00:52:56,001
Thank you.
My husband, Axel.

483
00:52:59,829 --> 00:53:02,105
Thank you, Axel.

484
00:53:02,165 --> 00:53:05,738
So everybody buy another pitcher
of beer because we need the gig.

485
00:53:07,804 --> 00:53:09,977
My sister's here
tonight, everybody.

486
00:53:13,276 --> 00:53:17,383
And we're gonna do one of her songs!

487
00:53:17,447 --> 00:53:20,485
You wanna come up and
do it with us, Georgia?

488
00:53:23,286 --> 00:53:26,267
- Georgia!
- Georgia!

489
00:53:31,528 --> 00:53:36,637
My sister! The single person
I'll miss when I leave this earth.

490
00:54:11,468 --> 00:54:12,747
Do this.

491
00:56:39,349 --> 00:56:41,955
So do you write, too, Sadie?
You do your own songs?

492
00:56:42,018 --> 00:56:43,964
I don't write songs.

493
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:47,092
That whole concept's foreign to me.

494
00:56:47,156 --> 00:56:51,571
I make 'em up. I put down the words
sometimes to remember 'em, but...

495
00:56:51,628 --> 00:56:53,574
You know.

496
00:56:55,331 --> 00:56:58,278
We're gonna have to go.
And don't get up.

497
00:57:04,173 --> 00:57:06,676
Congratulations. See ya.

498
00:57:13,916 --> 00:57:17,454
- That was a nice thing you did.
- Didn't know I had a choice.

499
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:21,127
- I thought it was pretty terrific.
- And there's a reporter there.

500
00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:23,830
I mean, what's that all about?

501
00:57:23,893 --> 00:57:25,895
What's runnin' through her head?

502
00:57:28,231 --> 00:57:32,976
- It was a good thing you did, Georgia.
- I feel bad for Axel.

503
00:57:33,036 --> 00:57:36,347
"I don't write.
I make them up."

504
00:57:36,406 --> 00:57:40,877
She didn't even say it. It's not even hers.
I mean, it belongs to someone else.

505
00:57:40,943 --> 00:57:43,822
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing--

506
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:46,087
I'm tired, that's all.

507
00:57:48,151 --> 00:57:50,222
She swallows people up.

508
00:57:51,721 --> 00:57:55,225
- How do you not see it?
- I think she's an original...

509
00:57:55,291 --> 00:57:59,034
And brave and without malice.

510
00:57:59,095 --> 00:58:01,041
Fine.

511
00:58:06,436 --> 00:58:10,248
- She shouldn't sing.
- What the hell's the matter with you?

512
00:58:20,416 --> 00:58:22,862
- Yet another casualty.
- Another casualty!

513
00:58:22,919 --> 00:58:24,865
- Pays the rent.
- Pays the rent.

514
00:58:24,921 --> 00:58:27,333
Pays the rent.

515
00:58:31,027 --> 00:58:33,837
- Are you fucked up?
- Hell, no.

516
00:58:33,896 --> 00:58:35,842
Hell, no.

517
00:58:37,734 --> 00:58:40,214
-Hi.
- Hi. Hello.

518
00:58:40,269 --> 00:58:43,045
You wanna bring your gear around back,
someone'll meet you back there.

519
00:58:43,106 --> 00:58:46,178
Hello. My name is Sadie.

520
00:58:46,242 --> 00:58:48,244
-Hi.
- Okay. Thanks.

521
00:58:48,311 --> 00:58:50,257
Don't fuck around.

522
00:59:00,690 --> 00:59:02,897
We gotta cut you loose.

523
00:59:03,993 --> 00:59:06,599
Yeah, uh, that's what you said.

524
00:59:06,662 --> 00:59:08,642
That's what you said.

525
00:59:08,698 --> 00:59:11,269
You're fucked up
all the time, Herman.

526
00:59:11,334 --> 00:59:16,545
I had Thursday down for the gig,
and I don't know how I got Thursday--

527
00:59:16,606 --> 00:59:19,052
It's not Thursday anymore, Herman.

528
00:59:19,108 --> 00:59:21,054
Thursday came and went.

529
00:59:22,712 --> 00:59:24,817
This stuff is making you stupid.

530
00:59:24,881 --> 00:59:28,158
Yeah. You think so?

531
00:59:32,388 --> 00:59:35,801
- So you all decided this together?
- Yeah.

532
00:59:35,858 --> 00:59:39,203
Not me.

533
00:59:39,262 --> 00:59:42,334
Leland and Paul and Clay,
we're tryin' to be in a business here.

534
00:59:42,398 --> 00:59:44,878
We're not 23 anymore.

535
00:59:44,934 --> 00:59:48,347
We at least gotta show up. I mean,
our drummer's gotta show up, Herman.

536
00:59:49,872 --> 00:59:52,512
I don't have a clue
how I missed it, Bobby.

537
00:59:52,575 --> 00:59:55,021
It's not the first time, H.

538
00:59:56,078 --> 00:59:58,024
It's not the tenth time.

539
01:00:01,050 --> 01:00:05,624
So... okay.

540
01:00:09,725 --> 01:00:11,671
Yeah.

541
01:00:12,728 --> 01:00:15,208
Don't be a stranger, okay?

542
01:00:15,264 --> 01:00:17,835
I love you guys.

543
01:00:20,536 --> 01:00:23,540
- All right, see you around, then.
- Take it easy, Herman.

544
01:00:35,551 --> 01:00:37,792
Well, that sucked pretty good.

545
01:00:37,854 --> 01:00:40,892
You guys would tell me if you
were lookin' for a new backup singer.

546
01:00:40,957 --> 01:00:45,235
- Come on, Sadie.
- You wouldn't you fuckers.

547
01:00:45,294 --> 01:00:47,638
You wouldn't, would you?

548
01:00:47,697 --> 01:00:49,699
Come on, Sadie.
Give it up.

549
01:00:49,765 --> 01:00:52,211
What's your fucking problem?

550
01:00:52,268 --> 01:00:56,341
Why do we have to turn this
into your loss, huh?

551
01:00:56,405 --> 01:00:59,352
Goddamn it, don't answer me.
Don't say anything.

552
01:01:00,810 --> 01:01:03,154
I wanna run through the set.

553
01:01:06,449 --> 01:01:09,293
It's nice. It's neat.

554
01:01:12,221 --> 01:01:16,260
It's-- You know, it's what Bobby
had to do, you know. I understand.

555
01:01:18,361 --> 01:01:20,363
I'd have done the same thing.

556
01:01:21,931 --> 01:01:23,877
Done the same thing, yeah.

557
01:01:27,803 --> 01:01:31,546
This stuff'll kill ya
a lot quicker than smack.

558
01:01:31,607 --> 01:01:34,611
You can go a lot of years
doin' smack, barring accident.

559
01:01:35,978 --> 01:01:38,925
Chety was 58.

560
01:01:40,149 --> 01:01:44,757
Art was 60 or something.

561
01:01:46,956 --> 01:01:49,436
Lady Day made it to her forties.

562
01:01:49,492 --> 01:01:53,099
It's not gonna be
a love affair with me...

563
01:01:53,162 --> 01:01:55,972
'cause I know it's
a real hard kick.

564
01:01:57,133 --> 01:01:59,409
Alcohol’s a bad shit man.

565
01:02:02,438 --> 01:02:04,440
It's a real bring-down.

566
01:02:09,211 --> 01:02:11,555
Those guys did everything, though.

567
01:02:12,782 --> 01:02:15,194
Did you ever try
morning glory seeds?

568
01:02:17,286 --> 01:02:19,288
What are you gonna do, H?

569
01:02:21,891 --> 01:02:24,838
Didn't you think Bobby
was gonna go the distance?

570
01:02:26,162 --> 01:02:29,541
I thought he was gonna go
the whole nine yards.

571
01:02:29,598 --> 01:02:32,306
You know, Bobby's a poet.

572
01:02:32,368 --> 01:02:35,076
He's an artist.

573
01:02:35,137 --> 01:02:40,314
When you see desperation
in the eyes, it's a bad sign.

574
01:02:40,376 --> 01:02:43,323
It gets to about payin' the rent.

575
01:02:43,379 --> 01:02:45,689
What are you gonna do, H?

576
01:02:48,784 --> 01:02:52,698
I can always get a gig.

577
01:02:52,755 --> 01:02:54,701
Don't you think so?

578
01:02:57,093 --> 01:02:59,767
I-I been lookin'
to get out of Seattle.

579
01:03:01,063 --> 01:03:03,942
But I'm afraid to leave
my connection you know?

580
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,537
Every time I go out of town,
it's a disaster.

581
01:03:06,602 --> 01:03:10,607
In Chicago, I went downtown
to see where to score,

582
01:03:10,673 --> 01:03:14,120
and I see these three
big, huge black guys...

583
01:03:14,176 --> 01:03:16,554
with guns in their pants.

584
01:03:16,612 --> 01:03:20,526
And I knew all that was gonna happen
was I was gonna get robbed.

585
01:03:20,583 --> 01:03:23,496
I moved to New Orleans.

586
01:03:23,552 --> 01:03:27,398
Tried to do it there.
Got robbed.

587
01:03:27,456 --> 01:03:30,369
I knew I was gonna get robbed,
and I got robbed.

588
01:03:30,426 --> 01:03:33,270
Then I--

589
01:03:33,329 --> 01:03:36,572
You know I used a detox
to get off the street.

590
01:03:40,736 --> 01:03:43,182
My sister's always good
for a few bucks.

591
01:03:45,207 --> 01:03:48,188
Mmm, she's not gonna
put me up forever.

592
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:53,883
I-I don't wanna be
on the street, man.

593
01:03:55,584 --> 01:03:57,825
It's not my bag.

594
01:04:02,324 --> 01:04:04,998
I th--I thought, you know,

595
01:04:05,061 --> 01:04:07,803
I could teach.

596
01:04:09,465 --> 01:04:11,411
Yeah?

597
01:04:13,569 --> 01:04:17,779
So you and Axel doin' okay?
You makin' out?

598
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:21,287
He has a car to work on.
Every so often.

599
01:04:21,343 --> 01:04:24,381
He's in paradise.

600
01:04:24,447 --> 01:04:28,020
And his mom sends him
a little somethin', regular.

601
01:04:31,687 --> 01:04:33,928
He's a neat guy, Axel.

602
01:04:33,989 --> 01:04:36,492
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

603
01:04:37,626 --> 01:04:39,799
Axel's a prince.

604
01:04:39,862 --> 01:04:42,433
Axel's a saint.

605
01:05:47,329 --> 01:05:49,275
Everybody now.

606
01:05:52,468 --> 01:05:55,415
Axel. I told them
to bring you in the studio.

607
01:05:55,471 --> 01:05:58,008
Yeah, I know
I don't like to disturb.

608
01:05:58,073 --> 01:06:00,952
It's not my nature.
How you doin' Jake?

609
01:06:01,010 --> 01:06:03,047
-All right.
- Hey, you.

610
01:06:03,112 --> 01:06:05,922
- Hello, Axel.
- Hey, you, Axel.

611
01:06:06,982 --> 01:06:09,553
-What's up, Axel?
- Everything's great.

612
01:06:09,618 --> 01:06:12,224
- Oh. -Georgia, you think
I could have a minute?

613
01:06:12,288 --> 01:06:15,861
Could I have a few minutes with Georgia, Jake?
No offense.

614
01:06:15,925 --> 01:06:19,395
- No offense, Axel.
-I mean, if you're takin' a break, you know.

615
01:06:19,461 --> 01:06:23,170
- I know. Sure.
- You wanna take a walk?

616
01:06:23,265 --> 01:06:25,541
So you think spring'll get here?

617
01:06:25,601 --> 01:06:28,480
- I think you can count on it.
- I think it's been delayed.

618
01:06:28,537 --> 01:06:31,177
Mechanical difficulties.

619
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:35,882
So you guys don't call a lot. You come into town.
You know, like, you don't always call.

620
01:06:35,945 --> 01:06:38,152
Well, there's not
always time, you know.

621
01:06:38,214 --> 01:06:41,491
You're not always home,
and we have to get back, and--

622
01:06:41,550 --> 01:06:43,587
Well, I understand.
Very much so.

623
01:06:43,652 --> 01:06:47,862
She sort of knows when you're
in town, that's all. It comes up.

624
01:06:47,923 --> 01:06:50,096
She doesn't call me either, Axel.

625
01:06:50,159 --> 01:06:53,106
When's the last time
you came out to the house?

626
01:06:53,162 --> 01:06:57,508
She's not with Bobby anymore.
It was like a self-fulfilling prophecy.

627
01:06:57,566 --> 01:07:01,275
You know, they had this history and everything.
It kept gettin' in the way.

628
01:07:01,337 --> 01:07:04,511
Sadie gets in the way, Axel.

629
01:07:04,573 --> 01:07:07,611
So, she's been sittin' in around town,
and she jams when she can.

630
01:07:09,311 --> 01:07:11,951
- You could help her.
- Like how, Axel?

631
01:07:14,183 --> 01:07:18,256
- You could do somethin' for her.
- Like what, Axel?

632
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:20,266
Honestly.

633
01:07:23,559 --> 01:07:27,530
It's just breakin' my heart, that's all.
She's full of hope. She's full of hope.

634
01:07:27,596 --> 01:07:31,772
You know what she's like.
Sometimes it gets too harsh, you know?

635
01:07:33,068 --> 01:07:35,514
You know, no offense.
You're her sister.

636
01:07:35,571 --> 01:07:38,381
You know, when you offer her money,

637
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:40,420
she takes the money--
and God knows, we could use it--

638
01:07:40,476 --> 01:07:43,923
but she takes it really
not to offend you.

639
01:07:43,979 --> 01:07:47,825
I think you don't know that.
Maybe you do know that.

640
01:07:47,883 --> 01:07:50,921
Maybe I don't know
what I'm talkin' about.

641
01:07:50,986 --> 01:07:54,160
I hate this, don't you?
It's freezing.

642
01:07:54,223 --> 01:07:56,294
Wanna get some coffee
or something?

643
01:08:13,375 --> 01:08:15,651
Steven Soles.

644
01:08:18,614 --> 01:08:20,560
The band is String fellow.

645
01:08:27,723 --> 01:08:29,794
Allright, Georgia!

646
01:08:32,361 --> 01:08:34,671
Georgia!

647
01:08:34,730 --> 01:08:37,438
You wanna shoot some pool?

648
01:08:38,967 --> 01:08:40,969
You got hours, whole hours.

649
01:08:43,739 --> 01:08:47,243
I gotcha.
It's gonna be all right.

650
01:08:48,344 --> 01:08:50,654
One, two, three.

651
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:14,003
Nice shot.

652
01:09:14,069 --> 01:09:16,879
Your lady's got a touch, Axel.

653
01:09:16,939 --> 01:09:18,885
Yeah.

654
01:09:22,211 --> 01:09:24,350
Oh, my God!

655
01:09:24,413 --> 01:09:26,723
I think we should start back.

656
01:09:26,782 --> 01:09:29,592
It's gonna be great.

657
01:09:29,651 --> 01:09:31,858
It's gonna be sensational.

658
01:09:33,689 --> 01:09:36,829
Who did this?
Did you do this?

659
01:09:36,892 --> 01:09:39,270
Georgia did this.

660
01:09:39,328 --> 01:09:43,003
- Why don't you hot have that?
- This is to you.

661
01:09:43,065 --> 01:09:45,545
For always being Jake.

662
01:09:46,769 --> 01:09:49,750
The only thing I ever
envied my sister.

663
01:09:50,973 --> 01:09:53,476
This is to you and tonight.

664
01:09:53,542 --> 01:09:55,488
- And tonight.
- Yeah.

665
01:10:00,315 --> 01:10:03,057
Georgia's pregnant.

666
01:10:03,118 --> 01:10:05,496
Oh?

667
01:10:05,554 --> 01:10:07,500
God!

668
01:10:09,024 --> 01:10:11,595
Well, that's so great!

669
01:10:11,660 --> 01:10:14,402
- It's pretty great.
- It's a knockout.

670
01:10:21,203 --> 01:10:25,379
It's a very special privilege for me
to bring Sadie Flood out here tonight.

671
01:10:32,881 --> 01:10:36,351
Seattle's home.

672
01:10:39,321 --> 01:10:41,801
We're gonna kick the shit
out of this thing!

673
01:10:41,857 --> 01:10:44,428
Put it to bed, baby.

674
01:10:46,361 --> 01:10:48,967
It's incredible
for me to be here,

675
01:10:49,031 --> 01:10:51,341
on this stage with my sister.

676
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:56,748
The single person I'll miss
when I leave this earth. Yeah.

677
01:10:56,805 --> 01:10:58,751
How sweet this is.

678
01:11:05,948 --> 01:11:09,623
The only thing that has any meaning
is what's real, right?

679
01:11:09,685 --> 01:11:13,030
What we get?
What we give each other?

680
01:11:15,023 --> 01:11:17,264
In the dark, we're all scared.

681
01:11:18,861 --> 01:11:22,070
We're all scared.

682
01:11:22,130 --> 01:11:24,736
And there's more of us
out there all the time, man.

683
01:11:28,537 --> 01:11:31,313
And the song is from Van Morrison.

684
01:19:44,032 --> 01:19:46,308
Thank you! God bless.

685
01:19:46,368 --> 01:19:48,905
You were real good.

686
01:19:48,970 --> 01:19:51,314
Keep drinkin'.
Round the edges.

687
01:19:51,373 --> 01:19:55,719
I love you.
I love you, Georgia.

688
01:20:06,788 --> 01:20:10,326
- Want me to drive?
- No, I don't want you to drive.

689
01:20:10,392 --> 01:20:13,805
I take it that you're angry with me.

690
01:20:13,862 --> 01:20:17,366
You took her to a bar,
got her juiced up, got you juiced up.

691
01:20:17,432 --> 01:20:20,811
Why would that bother me?

692
01:20:20,869 --> 01:20:24,681
She was wound up tight. She was
gonna come boppin' off the walls.

693
01:20:24,739 --> 01:20:26,685
Well, you fixed that.

694
01:20:29,477 --> 01:20:33,254
Did you seriously think that she had
no other access to a bottle...

695
01:20:33,314 --> 01:20:36,295
Or whatever else she wanted
before she got there?

696
01:20:39,054 --> 01:20:41,364
I don't need to be right, Georgia.

697
01:20:43,958 --> 01:20:47,269
I don't think I could ever grasp--

698
01:20:47,328 --> 01:20:50,571
I mean, not a clue--

699
01:20:50,632 --> 01:20:53,909
what it's like to be your sister.

700
01:20:55,904 --> 01:20:59,477
Ever so sorry about that.

701
01:20:59,541 --> 01:21:01,612
Very much so.

702
01:21:01,676 --> 01:21:04,122
Thank you Jake.

703
01:21:06,848 --> 01:21:08,794
I whipped your ass at pool.

704
01:21:08,850 --> 01:21:12,161
- Yup.
- I whipped his ass.

705
01:21:15,824 --> 01:21:19,169
- Where are we going?
- To the house.

706
01:21:19,227 --> 01:21:21,173
Ah. Right.

707
01:21:22,230 --> 01:21:24,301
Family weekend.

708
01:21:26,568 --> 01:21:29,378
So, was I great or was I great?

709
01:21:30,572 --> 01:21:33,075
I wish I'd been there.

710
01:21:33,141 --> 01:21:36,679
- You were there.
- Or was I just okay?

711
01:21:36,744 --> 01:21:39,054
You could hear a pin drop.

712
01:21:40,615 --> 01:21:42,561
You were great.

713
01:21:44,886 --> 01:21:48,129
I thought that you were somethin'.

714
01:21:48,189 --> 01:21:50,135
Ha!

715
01:21:55,797 --> 01:21:57,743
What did Sissy think?

716
01:22:01,469 --> 01:22:04,712
Ooh. Stern silence.

717
01:22:05,907 --> 01:22:09,013
Georgia was embarrassed of me.

718
01:22:09,077 --> 01:22:11,489
For me.

719
01:22:11,546 --> 01:22:13,492
Which?

720
01:22:13,548 --> 01:22:16,620
Georgia needed
to help me out up there.

721
01:22:16,684 --> 01:22:18,630
Didn't you, Georgia?

722
01:22:20,622 --> 01:22:25,298
See, I thought I was doin' fine,
but my sister...

723
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:28,341
Couldn't leave it alone.

724
01:22:28,396 --> 01:22:30,774
For fear of what?

725
01:22:32,300 --> 01:22:35,509
For fear of fucking what,
Georgia?

726
01:22:36,771 --> 01:22:39,513
Did I need saving, Georgia?

727
01:22:39,574 --> 01:22:42,521
How good did it feel
to be able to pull me out?

728
01:22:42,577 --> 01:22:46,719
It felt like a thousand pounds
of dead weight, Sadie.

729
01:22:46,781 --> 01:22:48,727
Is that what you wanna hear?

730
01:22:48,783 --> 01:22:51,730
I don't want this anymore Sadie.

731
01:22:51,786 --> 01:22:56,201
I want you to let go of me.
Let go of me!

732
01:22:56,257 --> 01:22:59,534
Please! Please, Sadie!

733
01:22:59,594 --> 01:23:03,474
Do whatever you have to do, but I
don't want to be a part of it anymore.

734
01:23:03,531 --> 01:23:05,477
I can't do it.

735
01:23:05,533 --> 01:23:07,638
- I don't wanna do it.
- Georgia.

736
01:23:10,505 --> 01:23:12,781
Right.

737
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:15,821
- Sadie! Sadie.
- Good Sadie.

738
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:23,156
- You wanna get out? Do you wanna get out, Sadie?
- Georgia.

739
01:23:23,218 --> 01:23:25,698
- Georgia!
- What do you wanna do?

740
01:23:27,055 --> 01:23:29,626
This is entirely up to you, Sadie.

741
01:23:30,992 --> 01:23:34,201
This rig's hot big enough
for the both of us.

742
01:23:35,496 --> 01:23:38,204
You're welcome to spend the night,
you and Axel.

743
01:23:38,266 --> 01:23:40,337
What do you wanna do, Sadie?

744
01:23:42,136 --> 01:23:44,116
We're in the middle of nowhere.

745
01:24:18,039 --> 01:24:20,781
How long were you
prepared to sit here?

746
01:25:18,333 --> 01:25:21,542
-Thanks, guys. Night.
- Night, Sadie.

747
01:25:21,602 --> 01:25:23,582
- Night, Sadie.
- Night.

748
01:25:29,577 --> 01:25:31,523
Well.

749
01:25:51,132 --> 01:25:54,238
- Can I fix you somethin'?
- No, sweetie.

750
01:25:54,302 --> 01:25:56,578
- It's no trouble.
- No, baby.

751
01:26:06,948 --> 01:26:09,485
- You scared of me, Axel?
- No.

752
01:26:13,888 --> 01:26:15,925
Gotta go home for a while.

753
01:26:17,392 --> 01:26:20,100
-Chicago?
- Yeah. For a while.

754
01:26:22,263 --> 01:26:24,903
I'll come with you.

755
01:26:24,966 --> 01:26:28,539
Well, you know, maybe you
could come later, you know?

756
01:26:32,940 --> 01:26:35,352
You takin' a hike, Axel?

757
01:26:35,410 --> 01:26:38,118
No.

758
01:26:38,179 --> 01:26:40,125
'Cause it's all right.

759
01:26:41,182 --> 01:26:44,163
I don't think my mom's okay.

760
01:26:46,754 --> 01:26:48,859
I'm sorry.

761
01:26:50,024 --> 01:26:52,129
I'll be back.

762
01:26:52,193 --> 01:26:55,436
Hard to know how long right?

763
01:26:57,031 --> 01:26:59,477
I can send for ya.

764
01:27:06,007 --> 01:27:09,147
This must've taken you
days, Axel.

765
01:27:09,210 --> 01:27:12,248
I can. I can send for ya.

766
01:27:12,313 --> 01:27:15,453
I'm 23, Sadie.
Try to cut me some slack.

767
01:27:15,516 --> 01:27:18,258
How 'bout a blowjob instead?

768
01:27:18,319 --> 01:27:20,196
Fuck you, Sadie.

769
01:27:20,254 --> 01:27:24,202
Didn't mean it. I swear.

770
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:28,401
I do everything
I know how for you.

771
01:27:28,463 --> 01:27:30,636
I know, Axel.

772
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:34,346
You gonna be all right?

773
01:27:37,104 --> 01:27:39,243
Yes.

774
01:27:39,307 --> 01:27:42,948
- I'm not leaving you.
- No.

775
01:27:43,010 --> 01:27:44,956
No such luck, all right?

776
01:27:48,616 --> 01:27:50,789
Send for me, Axel.

777
01:28:03,331 --> 01:28:06,904
- I got back.
- Did you meet Brian?

778
01:28:06,968 --> 01:28:09,847
- Yes.
- D'you know Georgia Flood, Brian?

779
01:28:09,904 --> 01:28:13,647
- This is her sister.
- Oh. Uh, well, it's good to meet ya.

780
01:28:13,708 --> 01:28:16,985
- I'm a big fan. - She sang
with Trucker, too. Didn't you?

781
01:28:17,044 --> 01:28:19,149
How's the world
treatin' you, Sade?

782
01:28:19,213 --> 01:28:21,955
Well, we're tryin'
to come to terms.

783
01:28:22,016 --> 01:28:25,054
You and the world?
That would be a shame.

784
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:28,794
- I'm a married woman.
- What, you?

785
01:28:28,856 --> 01:28:30,927
Yes, me. Yes, me.

786
01:28:32,059 --> 01:28:34,005
Well, congratulations.

787
01:28:35,897 --> 01:28:39,868
- So how you doin'?
-The same.

788
01:28:39,934 --> 01:28:44,144
Things are about to break.
I'm not a homosexual, Brian.

789
01:28:44,205 --> 01:28:46,310
Did she tell you
I was a homosexual?

790
01:28:46,374 --> 01:28:49,412
- No.
- Sadie's little joke.

791
01:28:49,477 --> 01:28:51,548
- Did you get another cat?
- No.

792
01:28:51,612 --> 01:28:54,149
Yeah. Well, I tried a dog.

793
01:28:54,215 --> 01:28:57,162
You can rely on a dog,
but I couldn't train him.

794
01:28:58,419 --> 01:29:00,456
Messed all over the apartment.

795
01:29:00,521 --> 01:29:03,229
He shit. He pissed.
So damned dependent, dogs.

796
01:29:06,928 --> 01:29:10,171
I need a gig, place to stay.

797
01:29:10,231 --> 01:29:12,905
Let me look into it, okay?

798
01:29:14,535 --> 01:29:17,311
Yeah, well, a place to stay.

799
01:29:19,540 --> 01:29:21,520
Yeah, I'll look into it.

800
01:29:21,576 --> 01:29:24,682
What kind of answer is that?
You're my manager, right?

801
01:29:24,745 --> 01:29:27,783
Whatever the hell that means.
Where were you for me to manage?

802
01:29:27,848 --> 01:29:31,955
I don' remember seeing ten percent
for the months at a time you were gone.

803
01:29:32,019 --> 01:29:36,263
It's not the money, Sadie.
I always thought you had the goods.

804
01:29:36,324 --> 01:29:40,067
I appreciate talent.
I put myself at the line.

805
01:29:40,127 --> 01:29:43,540
You want work and time to pay off.
I'm not above getting hurt.

806
01:29:43,598 --> 01:29:46,738
So if I'm not in total rapture
at seeing you,

807
01:29:46,801 --> 01:29:48,747
you'll understand.

808
01:29:48,803 --> 01:29:51,306
You are so
full of shit, Chasman.

809
01:29:52,506 --> 01:29:55,953
The other day man,
I couldn't find the door.

810
01:29:56,010 --> 01:29:58,456
-Shit.
- I swear

811
01:29:58,512 --> 01:30:01,356
I couldn't find the goddamn door.

812
01:30:01,415 --> 01:30:04,453
No fucking shit.

813
01:30:04,518 --> 01:30:07,556
You know where is the door
to this apartment...

814
01:30:07,622 --> 01:30:10,432
Like the back of my hand.

815
01:30:10,491 --> 01:30:13,563
And I can't find the door.

816
01:30:15,496 --> 01:30:17,976
Did you lose Brian?

817
01:30:19,667 --> 01:30:21,669
Brian found the door.

818
01:30:22,937 --> 01:30:24,883
Guess so.

819
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:28,850
Well, I'm game. Fuck it.

820
01:30:30,478 --> 01:30:33,288
We'll check ourselves in.

821
01:30:33,347 --> 01:30:35,520
Detox.

822
01:30:35,583 --> 01:30:40,293
We'll go to L.A. You've gotta
make it in L.A. to mean anything.

823
01:30:40,354 --> 01:30:43,824
- Yeah.
-We'll clean up.

824
01:30:45,826 --> 01:30:47,772
Yeah.

825
01:30:47,828 --> 01:30:50,206
Don't touch my wake-up.

826
01:30:51,766 --> 01:30:54,474
Want to find it right there
in the morning.

827
01:31:10,618 --> 01:31:13,497
Do you have a prepaid ticket here
for Sadie Flood?

828
01:31:16,257 --> 01:31:18,294
For Seattle. The 11:30?

829
01:31:20,561 --> 01:31:23,132
I'm not showing anything.
Flight 4847

830
01:31:23,197 --> 01:31:26,235
I don't know.
I'm in Medford, right?

831
01:31:26,300 --> 01:31:28,246
The 11:30.

832
01:31:29,770 --> 01:31:31,716
I'm not showing anything.

833
01:31:32,907 --> 01:31:36,377
Yeah, well, maybe you could call.

834
01:31:36,444 --> 01:31:39,357
As soon as it was prepaid,
they'd have put it in the computer.

835
01:31:39,413 --> 01:31:42,724
It would show up
on the computer.

836
01:31:42,783 --> 01:31:44,729
I'm sick, see?

837
01:31:45,786 --> 01:31:48,858
There was supposed
to be a wheelchair.

838
01:31:48,923 --> 01:31:51,369
So, uh, maybe you
could call someone.

839
01:31:51,425 --> 01:31:54,634
Why don't you have a seat?
I'll see what I can do.

840
01:31:54,695 --> 01:31:59,269
- Yeah well-
- There's another flight at 2:35.

841
01:31:59,333 --> 01:32:04,476
I'm not on this plane, I'm outta here.
It's a medical emergency.

842
01:32:06,540 --> 01:32:10,283
-I'm sick, and--
-How long ago was the ticket purchased?

843
01:32:10,344 --> 01:32:12,551
I don't know.
Hour. Half-hour.

844
01:32:12,613 --> 01:32:17,494
Look, do you have a supervisor?
I gotta be on the plane.

845
01:32:17,551 --> 01:32:21,658
I'm sick, see?
What's your name?

846
01:32:22,990 --> 01:32:26,164
Why don't you sit down
and let me see what I can do?

847
01:32:26,227 --> 01:32:28,901
I really need to take care of
the rest of these people.

848
01:32:28,963 --> 01:32:31,034
Okay, Helen.

849
01:32:33,634 --> 01:32:36,615
Who do you have to fuck
to get some help around here?

850
01:33:00,528 --> 01:33:05,136
<i>Rollinger, Munson, Okeson and Rice</i>

851
01:33:05,199 --> 01:33:08,476
<i>to the boarding doorway
gate C-2 for departure.</i>

852
01:33:29,123 --> 01:33:32,593
You can't get on the plane
without shoes, miss. You have shoes?

853
01:33:34,628 --> 01:33:36,665
Are you kidding me?

854
01:33:36,730 --> 01:33:39,108
It's an airline
regulation, miss.

855
01:33:40,434 --> 01:33:42,880
It's a medical emergency.
I have to get to a hospital.

856
01:33:42,937 --> 01:33:47,682
- I'm sorry ma'am.
- You're not gonna let me board?

857
01:33:47,741 --> 01:33:50,654
We can't let anybody board
without shoes, ma'am.

858
01:33:50,711 --> 01:33:54,284
Shit. Fucking horseshit, man!

859
01:33:54,348 --> 01:33:56,760
Anybody got a pair of shoes?

860
01:33:56,817 --> 01:33:58,922
This is a medical emergency.

861
01:34:00,387 --> 01:34:03,857
Anybody got a pair of shoes
so I can get on a goddamn plane?

862
01:34:03,924 --> 01:34:06,336
Please?

863
01:34:06,393 --> 01:34:11,900
Anybody wanna give me a pair of shoes
to get on this fucking plane, please?

864
01:34:15,302 --> 01:34:17,248
Thank you.

865
01:34:23,711 --> 01:34:28,592
<i>The arrival of flight
484 at 12:37 from Medford, Oregon.</i>

866
01:34:28,649 --> 01:34:32,722
<i>All those arriving passengers
can be met momentarily at gate R-54.</i>

867
01:34:47,668 --> 01:34:49,614
Hi.

868
01:34:52,373 --> 01:34:55,547
- I'm sorry.
- Your flight was early.

869
01:34:55,609 --> 01:34:57,555
Twenty minutes, yeah.

870
01:34:59,813 --> 01:35:03,226
I thought Jake would come.

871
01:35:03,284 --> 01:35:06,197
No, I wanted to come get you.

872
01:35:08,222 --> 01:35:10,634
So how'd you find me in here?

873
01:35:12,192 --> 01:35:14,229
I left my bag outside.

874
01:35:16,030 --> 01:35:20,206
- I'm really sick, Georgia.
- Let's get your stuff

875
01:35:20,267 --> 01:35:24,943
- Look at you. You told 'em not
to let me die, right? - Yeah.

876
01:35:25,005 --> 01:35:26,951
-You know what I mean?
- Yes.

877
01:35:27,007 --> 01:35:28,953
Thank you.

878
01:35:30,177 --> 01:35:32,248
I didn't know who else to call.

879
01:35:32,313 --> 01:35:35,783
I'm so sorry, Georgia.

880
01:35:41,989 --> 01:35:44,469
They weren't gonna let me
on the plane.

881
01:35:44,525 --> 01:35:46,664
This kid was great.

882
01:35:49,063 --> 01:35:51,009
Well, I'm thin, huh?

883
01:35:56,437 --> 01:35:59,418
You're not gonna be able to find a vein.
Why don't you let me do that?

884
01:35:59,473 --> 01:36:01,919
I think I've got this
under control.

885
01:36:16,323 --> 01:36:18,803
She’s gonna be okay.

886
01:36:18,859 --> 01:36:22,602
We're gonna be giving her high doses
of Valium so she doesn't seize.

887
01:36:22,663 --> 01:36:26,975
And he'll give her Clonidine patches
for the heroin.

888
01:36:27,034 --> 01:36:31,710
You go home and rest. She'll pretty
much sleep the next couple of days.

889
01:36:35,042 --> 01:36:38,956
This is probably
inappropriate, but...

890
01:36:39,013 --> 01:36:41,653
I'm a really big fan.

891
01:37:17,384 --> 01:37:19,489
What are you doin' here, Dad?

892
01:37:23,090 --> 01:37:25,229
I don't want you here, Dad.

893
01:37:26,660 --> 01:37:28,606
Really not.

894
01:37:30,764 --> 01:37:33,074
This is my party.

895
01:37:36,904 --> 01:37:38,850
Where's my sweetheart?

896
01:37:40,340 --> 01:37:42,286
Who?

897
01:37:44,211 --> 01:37:47,624
This guy I was sleeping with.

898
01:37:47,681 --> 01:37:49,627
He left me.

899
01:37:49,683 --> 01:37:54,462
- She awake?
- She wants a cigarette.

900
01:38:06,767 --> 01:38:08,906
I'm sorry about the robe.

901
01:38:10,404 --> 01:38:12,816
I really love this robe.

902
01:38:12,873 --> 01:38:15,877
I don't care about the robe.
It's yours.

903
01:38:25,018 --> 01:38:27,965
Make sure she's sitting up
while she's smoking

904
01:38:28,021 --> 01:38:29,967
Don't nod out on us, Sadie.

905
01:38:34,094 --> 01:38:37,837
We're very proud of this girl.
She's come a really long way.

906
01:38:37,898 --> 01:38:42,540
She's the best nurse on the ward.
You are, huh?

907
01:38:46,607 --> 01:38:49,486
They hate me here.

908
01:38:49,543 --> 01:38:51,489
They do.

909
01:38:53,881 --> 01:38:57,658
So this must be
a real embarrassment to you.

910
01:38:57,718 --> 01:39:00,858
No. Why?

911
01:39:02,322 --> 01:39:04,268
Cry all the time.

912
01:39:05,759 --> 01:39:08,399
The patches make me a little--

913
01:39:10,130 --> 01:39:12,076
You know.

914
01:39:13,300 --> 01:39:17,646
- Well, you see.
- How's it goin'?

915
01:39:19,706 --> 01:39:23,711
Lots of paperwork.
It's all paperwork.

916
01:39:23,777 --> 01:39:27,554
And meetings. Meetings.

917
01:39:29,616 --> 01:39:34,463
I'm having some trouble with
the God-as-I-understand-Him part.

918
01:39:34,521 --> 01:39:38,094
What was Dad doing here?

919
01:39:39,493 --> 01:39:41,473
-Dad?
- Really.

920
01:39:42,763 --> 01:39:45,607
I don't think so.

921
01:39:45,666 --> 01:39:47,805
Right there in that chair.

922
01:39:55,109 --> 01:39:58,420
I like my counselor. David.

923
01:40:00,547 --> 01:40:02,527
Donald.

924
01:40:02,583 --> 01:40:05,257
-Which?
- David.

925
01:40:05,319 --> 01:40:08,027
Donald.

926
01:40:08,088 --> 01:40:10,034
David Donald.

927
01:40:10,090 --> 01:40:12,934
I think that's his name.

928
01:40:14,262 --> 01:40:16,606
Do you want me to call Axel?

929
01:40:18,065 --> 01:40:20,375
Oh, God. Axel.

930
01:40:22,669 --> 01:40:24,615
Sweet Axel.

931
01:40:29,876 --> 01:40:32,356
Axel needs to get a life.

932
01:40:55,335 --> 01:40:59,283
So when do you think
you're gonna have this baby?

933
01:40:59,339 --> 01:41:01,285
I don't know.

934
01:41:02,476 --> 01:41:04,422
Can I?

935
01:41:12,119 --> 01:41:14,065
It's so amazing.

936
01:41:19,293 --> 01:41:22,331
Did I tell you about Stewart?

937
01:41:22,396 --> 01:41:26,572
- The one who designed speakers.
- For concerts.

938
01:41:26,633 --> 01:41:30,274
- He was in love with you.
- Yeah.

939
01:41:30,337 --> 01:41:33,045
- You mean Sam.
-Sam?

940
01:41:34,641 --> 01:41:36,587
Yeah.

941
01:41:44,985 --> 01:41:48,194
Did I tell you about Sam?

942
01:41:52,459 --> 01:41:54,405
Ow.

943
01:42:16,416 --> 01:42:18,794
You look good.

944
01:42:18,853 --> 01:42:20,799
You too.

945
01:42:23,156 --> 01:42:26,296
- They had to see if I was approved.
- Yeah.

946
01:42:26,360 --> 01:42:30,137
I make a list.
Like I'm in control here.

947
01:42:32,232 --> 01:42:34,508
So how is it?

948
01:42:34,568 --> 01:42:36,809
It's great. Yeah.

949
01:42:38,572 --> 01:42:40,552
Real people.

950
01:42:43,176 --> 01:42:45,122
So how you doin'?

951
01:42:46,279 --> 01:42:48,725
You know. Survival.

952
01:42:50,784 --> 01:42:52,730
And Bobby?

953
01:42:53,820 --> 01:42:55,766
Seattle's own, huh?

954
01:42:56,490 --> 01:42:59,266
- Say hello.
- Sure.

955
01:43:03,264 --> 01:43:05,244
I did it myself.

956
01:43:06,633 --> 01:43:10,638
- It was driving me crazy.
- They let you have scissors?

957
01:43:10,705 --> 01:43:13,208
Yeah. Scissors.

958
01:43:19,212 --> 01:43:21,715
So you think I look okay?

959
01:43:21,782 --> 01:43:23,728
You look great.

960
01:43:27,988 --> 01:43:30,696
I miss you guys.

961
01:43:30,757 --> 01:43:33,397
- Yeah, me too.
-I miss Herman.

962
01:43:35,262 --> 01:43:38,209
Yeah, me too.
I could've called that.

963
01:43:39,833 --> 01:43:41,972
- What?
- Uh, shit.

964
01:43:42,035 --> 01:43:46,882
I'm sorry.
A month, month and a half ago.

965
01:43:52,246 --> 01:43:54,226
Fuckin' Herman.

966
01:44:35,323 --> 01:44:39,203
Good job, Druid.

967
01:44:49,236 --> 01:44:52,479
I can't afford to go
to Mardi Gras this year.

968
01:44:52,539 --> 01:44:55,918
I don't even care about payin'
my phone bill, know what I mean?

969
01:45:01,581 --> 01:45:06,428
My mind gets up
five minutes before I do.

970
01:45:06,486 --> 01:45:08,557
And then it's sitting on the bed.

971
01:45:09,789 --> 01:45:12,326
Saying "I've been waiting for you.

972
01:45:12,392 --> 01:45:15,464
"I have something to say to you

973
01:45:15,529 --> 01:45:18,203
"I've been wanting to talk to you"

974
01:45:25,171 --> 01:45:28,744
My mind says
"I've been awake all night

975
01:45:28,808 --> 01:45:31,618
"I just want you to know
you have Cancer."

976
01:45:33,046 --> 01:45:36,050
"You're on the verge of bankruptcy.

977
01:45:36,116 --> 01:45:39,859
"Nobody likes you."
Overriding doom.

978
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:43,026
- It's a mind fuck.
- Andrew.

979
01:45:43,089 --> 01:45:45,695
He's all right.

980
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:49,902
- You're goin' all touchy-feely, Andrew
- I don't mind.

981
01:45:49,963 --> 01:45:53,342
I'm sure not.

982
01:45:54,902 --> 01:45:56,848
Bray Hammond Kiley.

983
01:45:58,139 --> 01:46:00,415
That's a lot of weight.

984
01:46:00,473 --> 01:46:03,920
My mother's father's name.

985
01:46:03,977 --> 01:46:07,356
- It'll keep him grounded
- One would hope.

986
01:46:12,219 --> 01:46:17,168
- You didn't come visit.
- No, I didn't, but I love you just the same.

987
01:46:18,491 --> 01:46:21,062
I hold a very special place
for you, Sadie.

988
01:46:21,127 --> 01:46:23,334
Do you, Jake?

989
01:46:24,397 --> 01:46:26,638
Yeah. A sacred place.

990
01:46:28,702 --> 01:46:30,648
Well,

991
01:46:30,705 --> 01:46:34,414
You've only ever been
the only man in the world, Jake.

992
01:47:04,672 --> 01:47:06,777
Yes.

993
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:08,842
-Yes? You sure?
- Yes. Mm -hmm.

994
01:47:08,908 --> 01:47:13,015
I don't wanna take it unless it
was goin' to Goodwill anyway.

995
01:47:13,079 --> 01:47:15,923
You're in my closet, Sadie.

996
01:47:15,982 --> 01:47:19,452
You can have anything
you like, really. Yours.

997
01:47:19,520 --> 01:47:22,194
Don't do that.

998
01:47:22,255 --> 01:47:24,257
Don't do what?

999
01:47:24,325 --> 01:47:26,305
Take what you need.

1000
01:47:49,382 --> 01:47:51,362
What are you doin'?

1001
01:47:51,419 --> 01:47:54,059
Nothing. My favorite thing.

1002
01:47:56,923 --> 01:47:59,130
Mish has got the ticket.

1003
01:48:00,427 --> 01:48:02,634
She can become weightless.

1004
01:48:02,696 --> 01:48:05,939
Thin air. It's something
I'm apt to encourage.

1005
01:48:08,736 --> 01:48:11,239
Are you gonna need money?

1006
01:48:11,304 --> 01:48:16,549
- Not a lot.
- It's not a bottomless pit, Sadie.

1007
01:48:18,178 --> 01:48:21,455
Well, Sis... I know that, Sis.

1008
01:48:22,749 --> 01:48:26,822
I'm keepin' accounts.
You didn't know that.

1009
01:48:26,886 --> 01:48:29,833
You're so funny, Sadie.

1010
01:48:32,827 --> 01:48:35,808
- You haven't asked my plans.
- No, I haven't.

1011
01:48:37,497 --> 01:48:39,443
Do you care?

1012
01:48:41,034 --> 01:48:42,980
I knew you'd tell me.

1013
01:48:44,672 --> 01:48:48,381
Uncertain. I think L.A.

1014
01:48:48,441 --> 01:48:51,513
I think in stages.

1015
01:48:51,579 --> 01:48:53,525
Oh, good.

1016
01:48:54,715 --> 01:48:58,219
- Good what?
- I don't know, Sadie.

1017
01:48:58,284 --> 01:49:00,321
As long as you're okay.

1018
01:49:20,974 --> 01:49:22,920
I was just thinkin', you know?

1019
01:49:24,711 --> 01:49:27,191
You never left home, Georgia.

1020
01:49:27,247 --> 01:49:29,284
I guess so.

1021
01:49:30,550 --> 01:49:33,793
I must scare the shit out of you.

1022
01:49:33,853 --> 01:49:36,356
I must be your worst nightmare.

1023
01:49:37,925 --> 01:49:39,996
Sadie's out there gobbling it up.

1024
01:49:41,127 --> 01:49:44,734
Always. That's always
how I see you.

1025
01:49:44,798 --> 01:49:47,438
Gabbling it up again.

1026
01:49:47,500 --> 01:49:49,810
I hate the desperation.

1027
01:49:51,671 --> 01:49:54,151
Everything's so desperate.

1028
01:49:55,776 --> 01:49:59,690
Yeah. Well, you don't do
anything desperate.

1029
01:49:59,746 --> 01:50:03,091
You don't feel
anything desperately.

1030
01:50:03,149 --> 01:50:05,755
It's not in your nature.

1031
01:50:05,819 --> 01:50:08,527
Feeling isn't your
strong suit, Georgia.

1032
01:50:08,588 --> 01:50:10,534
No, not like you.

1033
01:50:10,590 --> 01:50:13,161
- Nothing consuming.
- No.

1034
01:50:13,226 --> 01:50:15,638
- Not passion.
- Passion?

1035
01:50:18,264 --> 01:50:20,505
Okay, passion.

1036
01:50:20,567 --> 01:50:24,879
-Or pain.
- No. Or suffering.

1037
01:50:24,938 --> 01:50:28,044
That's a gift you mistake
for voice, Sadie.

1038
01:50:28,107 --> 01:50:30,849
My God. It's how
you define yourself.

1039
01:50:30,910 --> 01:50:32,890
It's yours. I'll give you that.

1040
01:50:32,946 --> 01:50:36,325
Sadie's pain has to be fed,
goddamn it.

1041
01:50:36,382 --> 01:50:38,658
Kept alive.

1042
01:50:38,718 --> 01:50:41,597
And we're all here
ready to serve.

1043
01:50:43,089 --> 01:50:45,467
You don't sing Sadie.

1044
01:50:45,526 --> 01:50:47,472
You can't sing.

1045
01:50:55,568 --> 01:50:57,514
You wish.

1046
01:51:36,376 --> 01:51:38,322
My name's Sadie Flood.

1047
01:51:40,747 --> 01:51:44,752
And we're gonna come to terms,
Portland, okay?

1048
01:51:44,817 --> 01:51:47,696
This is my harp player
and my guitar player, Mark Olsen.

1049
01:51:50,257 --> 01:51:53,932
- And my drummer--
- What? - Joey.
Joey Denizzioni.

1050
01:51:55,028 --> 01:51:58,009
- Joey. What?
- Denizzioni.

1051
01:51:58,065 --> 01:52:00,739
Joey Denizzioni on the drums.

1052
01:52:02,035 --> 01:52:04,481
And Guy Davis on bass.

1053
01:52:09,910 --> 01:52:11,856
Thank you.

1054
01:53:42,535 --> 01:53:45,880
No one does that song
better than my sister.

1055
01:53:49,475 --> 01:53:53,116
Who? Thank you, comrade.

1056
