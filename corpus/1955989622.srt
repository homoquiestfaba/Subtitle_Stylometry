you know,

19
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:09,233
If it wasn't for sex,

20
00:01:09,233 --> 00:01:10,733
Franny and i would have

21
00:01:10,733 --> 00:01:12,233
A perfect relationship.

22
00:01:12,233 --> 00:01:14,067

Than bad.

26
00:01:20,167 --> 00:01:23,067
She's just shut everything out.

27
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,100
it's just that i have

28
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,067
Different kinds of desires.

29

Mike and beth,

67
00:05:07,533 --> 00:05:09,133
They took the time,

00:05:09,933 --> 00:05:11,933
Two weeks in paradise.

00:07:32,667 --> 00:07:34,833
No, not change. She's...

116
00:07:36,533 --> 00:07:37,600
I look at her

117
00:07:38,967 --> 00:07:39,833
And it's like looking

118
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:40,900
At a stranger.

119
00:07:42,467 --> 00:07:44,533

speaking of fixing things,

129
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:55,800

well, no. Don't say we

136
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,300
Because frankly

137
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:04,967
I still don't understand

138
00:08:04,967 --> 00:08:06,133
That you couldn't see that

139
00:08:06,133 --> 00:08:06,567

140
00:08:06,567 --> 00:08:07,767
In trouble but -->

141
00:08:07,767 --> 00:08:08,367

203
00:09:37,067 --> 00:09:38,500
more like a root canal

204
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,467
Without novocain.

205
00:09:39,467 --> 00:09:40,533

But now we are, you see.

240
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,500
Once we decided to break up,

241

A long time.

280
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,567
i think she looked

281
00:11:21,567 --> 00:11:22,633
Like a whore.

282
00:11:25,467 --> 00:11:26,500
maybe.

283
00:11:29,433 --> 00:11:30,600
i think mike had that

284
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,400
Kind of hollow look that

285
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,533
Divorced men get, you know,

286
00:11:34,533 --> 00:11:36,967
Kinda like a hungry wolf.

287
00:11:38,433 --> 00:11:39,233
[sighs].

288
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:40,467

298
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,867
It's like...

299
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,800
We have the opposite problem

300
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,967
Of most people, you know?

301
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,600

302
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,967
Impotent and he is the one

303
00:12:24,967 --> 00:12:25,600

Go get your wife.

458
00:21:39,467 --> 00:21:40,467

You're in love,

460
00:21:42,667 --> 00:21:44,600
You do, it's natural

00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,433
And that's enough.

462
00:21:45,433 --> 00:21:46,733
That's enough.

00:21:47,533 --> 00:21:52,733
Music.

It's perfect.

475
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:33,167
[gasping].

476
00:23:39,467 --> 00:23:42,333
[gasping].

477
00:24:04,233 --> 00:24:05,600
[sobbing].

478
00:24:23,067 --> 00:24:23,967
and they said that men

479
00:24:23,967 --> 00:24:25,767
Are just in it for sex.

480
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:37,067
Can we talk about

481
00:24:37,067 --> 00:24:38,333

482
00:24:39,633 --> 00:24:40,200
no.

483
00:24:40,967 --> 00:24:41,700
Why?

484
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:45,167
i just figured there

485
00:24:45,167 --> 00:24:46,067
Might be word about

486
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:48,633
Something or somebody.

487
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,267
no.

488
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,467
I'm happy for beth.

489
00:25:04,067 --> 00:25:05,867
I think mike's a child

490
00:25:05,867 --> 00:25:06,767
And i also think that

491
00:25:06,767 --> 00:25:07,467
She deserves much better -->

492
00:25:07,467 --> 00:25:08,700
okay, okay, okay, but

493
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,900
Okay, that's fine.

494
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:10,967
That's good.

495
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:13,900
Okay, mike has had a couple

496
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:14,967
Of problems he's working out.

497
00:25:14,967 --> 00:25:15,900
yes, but why should beth

498
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,067
Have to suffer, alright?

499
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,300
I think it's great all the

500
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,600
Stuff she did on vacation.

501
00:25:25,467 --> 00:25:26,067
I always knew she had

502
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:27,800
A wild streak in her.

503
00:25:31,133 --> 00:25:33,567
hon, this isn't about

504
00:25:33,567 --> 00:25:35,200
Her wild times and making

00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,833
Measures, hmm?

506
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,100

507
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,467
Are over for good.

508
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,233

00:26:05,833 --> 00:26:07,133

515
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,800
yeah, just my stomach.

516

518
00:26:15,433 --> 00:26:16,800

I want some.

523
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,800
She gives all the guys one.

524
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,867
[laughing].

525
00:26:40,367 --> 00:26:42,067
That was last week.

00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,533

527
00:26:44,533 --> 00:26:45,467

You were telling me.

530
00:26:46,933 --> 00:26:49,367
You know, the story you read.

531
00:26:49,367 --> 00:26:50,600
all it mentioned was that

532
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,967
Sex takes up 1% of our lives.

533
00:26:52,967 --> 00:26:54,167
that much time?

534
00:26:54,167 --> 00:26:55,100
how much is 1% of

535
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:55,833
24 hours?

536
00:26:55,833 --> 00:26:56,733
who says that it does?

537
00:26:56,733 --> 00:26:57,667
it does.

538
00:26:57,667 --> 00:26:58,733
it does not.

539
00:26:59,067 --> 00:26:59,633
everybody knows that

540
00:26:59,633 --> 00:27:00,300
The whole world

541
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,200
Revolves around sex.

542
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,400
fran, i'll tell you -->

543
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,300
we kill, die, suffer

544
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,467
And get divorced all for

545
00:27:04,467 --> 00:27:05,933
A little nooky nooky.

546
00:27:05,933 --> 00:27:07,433
[laughing].

547
00:27:07,433 --> 00:27:08,367
oh, there she goes again.

548
00:27:08,367 --> 00:27:10,767
Anytime anybody mentions sex,

549
00:27:10,767 --> 00:27:12,067
There she goes.

550
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,300
that's not true.

551
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,067
well, i don't know about

552
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:16,667
The rest of you guys but -->

553
00:27:16,667 --> 00:27:17,100
no big deal.

554
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,333
but i really

555
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:19,200
I don't think i would have

556
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,100
A problem with opening up

557
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,600
And telling my most intimate,

558
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,700
Filthy secrets to a total

565
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:29,867
Will, can perverts read?

566
00:27:29,867 --> 00:27:30,733

568
00:27:31,867 --> 00:27:33,233
i'm going to cry.

569
00:27:33,233 --> 00:27:34,067
[laughs].

570
00:27:34,467 --> 00:27:35,133

571
00:27:35,133 --> 00:27:36,067
Why don't you lighten

I'm sorry, you know.

574
00:27:38,433 --> 00:27:40,867
After all, what's a little

Sex among friends?

576
00:27:42,367 --> 00:27:43,600

804
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,800
well, when you're

805
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,600
Having sex, do you come

806
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,400
Just from intercourse?

807
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,900
no, honey, no.

808
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:53,800
Usually it requires some

809
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,900
Sort of manual stimulation.

810
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:56,400
of course, franny.

811
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:56,967
I mean that's why

812
00:36:56,967 --> 00:36:58,500
Men have fingers.

813
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,433
and toes.

814
00:36:59,433 --> 00:37:00,667

That was only one.

817
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,400
seriously, it's like

818
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,633
When god created women,

819
00:37:06,633 --> 00:37:08,067
He made a mistake.

820
00:37:08,367 --> 00:37:09,267
He put our clit

821
00:37:09,267 --> 00:37:11,367
This much too far forward

822
00:37:11,367 --> 00:37:12,267
And if he just moved it back

823
00:37:12,267 --> 00:37:13,400
A little bit -->

824
00:37:13,867 --> 00:37:14,967

00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,667

830
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,067

Where's your wife?

980
00:46:07,667 --> 00:46:08,733
she is out

981
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:11,733
And we are alone.

982
00:46:14,867 --> 00:46:16,600
franny's hurting.

983

00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,400
Meg takes my heart away.

988
00:46:29,233 --> 00:46:30,733
Didn't you say something

989
00:46:30,733 --> 00:46:33,600
About not wanting to

990
00:46:34,067 --> 00:46:35,200
Feel anymore?

991
00:46:35,833 --> 00:46:37,800
it's safer that way.

992
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,067
But life isn't safe now,

993
00:46:39,067 --> 00:46:39,767
Is it?

994
00:46:41,533 --> 00:46:43,067
I guess i'm just not very good

995
00:46:43,067 --> 00:46:45,067
At putting up walls.

996
00:46:45,067 --> 00:46:46,933
i'm in construction

997

1015
00:48:08,067 --> 00:48:08,967
And the last time i played

1016
00:48:08,967 --> 00:48:10,067
That, i got arrested.

1017
00:48:10,067 --> 00:48:10,800

1018
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:11,567

1025
00:48:16,833 --> 00:48:17,367

1026
00:48:17,367 --> 00:48:18,500
Surprise me?

1027
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:19,600
Franny, why does this not

1028
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:20,667
Surprise me?

1029
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:21,533
yes.

1030
00:48:21,967 --> 00:48:22,700
no way.

1034
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:27,133
I thought you were

1035
00:48:27,133 --> 00:48:28,500
A convent, honey.

1036
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,067
alright, okay.

1037
00:48:30,067 --> 00:48:31,300
Rules are simple.

1038
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:32,167
Just in case you've forgotten,

1039
00:48:32,167 --> 00:48:32,800
Rules are simple.

1040
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,600
Just, if you take truth,

1041
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:35,167
You have to answer

1042
00:48:35,167 --> 00:48:36,367
Some questions truthfully.

1043
00:48:36,367 --> 00:48:36,967
And if you pick dare,

1044
00:48:36,967 --> 00:48:37,600
Then you have to take

1045
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:38,367
The dare.

1046
00:48:38,367 --> 00:48:39,500
Franny, you're going first.

00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:40,100

Let me get over here.

1050

1058
00:48:52,633 --> 00:48:53,533
no...

1059
00:48:53,533 --> 00:48:54,667
we can embarass ourselves.

1060
00:48:54,667 --> 00:48:55,967
you can embarass me.

1061
00:48:55,967 --> 00:48:58,067
[indistinct talking].

1062
00:48:59,333 --> 00:49:00,600
no, come on, franny.

1063
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:02,400
You want truth or dare?

1064
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,233
Which one?

1065
00:49:08,067 --> 00:49:08,933
here we go.

franny, the truth.

1068

there it is.

1070
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,067
There it is.

well be right back

1072
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:20,767
At the roof to wisconsin.

1073
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:22,067
you remember

1074
00:49:22,067 --> 00:49:22,900
The swallow, honey?

1075
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:24,067
We cycled back to campus.

1076
00:49:24,067 --> 00:49:25,100
oh, lovely birds!

1077
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:26,267
[whistling].

1078
00:49:27,267 --> 00:49:28,333
i think that's a pass.

1079
00:49:28,333 --> 00:49:29,267
Let's go on.

1081
00:49:31,333 --> 00:49:32,200
that's too eager.

1082

[indistinct chattering].

1086
00:49:40,767 --> 00:49:41,700
no truth. Dare.

1087
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:42,267

Obscene phone call.

01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:55,400
That's not exactly

A foundation for

1458
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:58,100

01:13:49,933 --> 01:13:50,800
I can't believe you

1553
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:51,567
Know that.

1554
01:13:52,633 --> 01:13:54,067
That's amazing.

1555
01:13:58,900 --> 01:14:01,167
do i look like you

1556
01:14:01,867 --> 01:14:03,367
Imagined i would?

1557
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:06,567
no.

1558
01:14:10,633 --> 01:14:11,667
Better.

1559
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:15,933
So much better, meg.

1560
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:22,267
What about me?

1561
01:14:26,533 --> 01:14:27,400
i tried not to

1562
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:29,233
Picture anything.

1563
01:14:29,233 --> 01:14:30,100
That way i wouldn't be

1564
01:14:30,100 --> 01:14:31,400
Disappointed.

1565
01:14:35,833 --> 01:14:36,567
[sighs].

1566
01:14:40,067 --> 01:14:40,767
are you?

1567
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:41,700
no.

1568
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:48,867
Oh, this is so awkward.

1569
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:53,067
I know what you sound

1570
01:14:53,067 --> 01:14:54,100
Like coming.

1571
01:14:56,367 --> 01:14:56,933
I don't even know what

1572
01:14:56,933 --> 01:14:59,067
Your favorite color is.

1573
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:01,367
white.

1574
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:06,467
great to know.

1575
01:15:08,733 --> 01:15:09,800
Mine is blue.

1576
01:15:13,533 --> 01:15:15,600
I've been so incredibly

1577
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:16,667
Busy lately.

1578
01:15:17,067 --> 01:15:19,167
Writing reports mostly.

1579
01:15:20,067 --> 01:15:21,800
I think writing is probably

1580
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:22,733
The loneliest thing

1581
01:15:22,733 --> 01:15:23,767
In the world.

1582
01:15:27,333 --> 01:15:29,067
[creaking].

1583
01:15:42,067 --> 01:15:43,133
hello, meg.

1584
01:15:51,433 --> 01:15:53,100
Music.

[breathing heavily].

1586
01:16:04,633 --> 01:16:05,533
meg, no.

1587
01:16:05,533 --> 01:16:06,133
i want to.

1588
01:16:06,133 --> 01:16:07,533
Let me touch you.

1589
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:12,700
this is for you.

1590
01:16:15,433 --> 01:16:16,633
This is for you.

1591
01:16:16,633 --> 01:16:18,067
It's all for you.

1592
01:16:23,867 --> 01:16:25,567
[panting].

1593
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:31,233
Open your eyes, meg.

1594
01:16:31,867 --> 01:16:33,400
I want to see them.

1595
01:16:35,867 --> 01:16:36,833
[moaning].

1596
01:16:40,167 --> 01:16:41,367
I want to see you, meg.

1597
01:16:41,367 --> 01:16:42,567
I want to see you.

1598
01:16:42,567 --> 01:16:43,533
I want to see you.

1599
01:16:43,533 --> 01:16:44,467
I want to see you, meg.

1600
01:16:44,467 --> 01:16:45,867
I want to see you.

1601
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:47,067
[gasps].

1602
01:16:48,833 --> 01:16:51,067
[moaning].

1603
01:17:06,367 --> 01:17:08,967
[gasping].

1604
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:16,400
i can't believe how soon

1605
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:17,400
I can do that.

1606
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:18,467
oh god, no.

1607
01:17:19,167 --> 01:17:20,233
No, no, no.

1608
01:17:20,733 --> 01:17:21,133
God!

1609
01:17:21,667 --> 01:17:23,600
You look so beautiful.

1610
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:25,533
You get all shiny

1611
01:17:25,533 --> 01:17:26,467
Like a pony.

1612
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:35,533
[footsteps].

1613
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:42,200
shouldn't you be home

1614
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:43,467
With your wife?

1615
01:17:44,467 --> 01:17:45,567
yeah, well,

1616
01:17:46,267 --> 01:17:47,200
Both the little ones

1617
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:49,267
Are in bed and shelley

1618
01:17:49,267 --> 01:17:50,467
Is probably off watching

1619
01:17:50,467 --> 01:17:51,067
"the love connection"

1620
01:17:51,067 --> 01:17:52,467
Right about now.

1621
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:57,800
okay, come on.

1622
01:18:00,967 --> 01:18:02,333
[footsteps].

1623
01:18:06,967 --> 01:18:08,067
fear of age.

1624
01:18:09,667 --> 01:18:11,767
No, it's more than that.

1625
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:13,233
I've had chance

1626
01:18:13,233 --> 01:18:14,767
To fool around.

1627
01:18:14,767 --> 01:18:15,700
It's wrong.

1628
01:18:16,933 --> 01:18:18,433
You gotta consider the kids.

1629
01:18:18,433 --> 01:18:19,067
It's not fair to them.

1630
01:18:19,067 --> 01:18:20,733
I've got two of them.

1631
01:18:22,133 --> 01:18:23,300
My father walked out on me

1632
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:23,933
When i was still in

1633
01:18:23,933 --> 01:18:25,067
Grade school

1634
01:18:25,967 --> 01:18:26,900
And i vowed never to let

1635
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:28,833
That happen to my kids.

1636
01:18:30,167 --> 01:18:31,667
Anyway, you get married

1637
01:18:31,667 --> 01:18:32,833
And you make promises

1638
01:18:32,833 --> 01:18:34,833
To each other, vows.

1639
01:18:37,333 --> 01:18:38,167
Sometimes when a person

1640
01:18:38,167 --> 01:18:38,767
Doesn't live up to

1641
01:18:38,767 --> 01:18:40,833
Their end of the bargain

1642
01:18:40,833 --> 01:18:42,833
And you end it,

1643
01:18:44,667 --> 01:18:45,967
I guess, i mean,

1644
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:48,667
If you can't fix it...

1645
01:18:50,133 --> 01:18:52,200
I'm not trying to fix it.

1646
01:18:54,067 --> 01:18:54,933
Sometimes i think it's

1647
01:18:54,933 --> 01:18:56,667
Just beyond repair.

1648
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:00,700
what are you doing?

1649
01:19:01,233 --> 01:19:02,733
you said i could.

1650
01:19:03,067 --> 01:19:03,500
no.

1651
01:19:03,967 --> 01:19:04,833
What i say and what

1652
01:19:04,833 --> 01:19:06,633
I choose to do are two

1653
01:19:06,633 --> 01:19:08,233
Different things.

1654
01:19:11,133 --> 01:19:11,900
No.

1655
01:19:12,533 --> 01:19:14,367
richard, i want you.

1656
01:19:17,333 --> 01:19:17,933
Come on.

1657
01:19:18,833 --> 01:19:20,400
I've been a good girl.

1658
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:22,867
i'll be the judge of that.

1659
01:19:23,267 --> 01:19:24,300
ow.

1660
01:19:27,433 --> 01:19:28,933
Ow, that hurts.

1661
01:19:28,933 --> 01:19:31,100
it's supposed to hurt.

1662
01:19:32,833 --> 01:19:34,500
Hey, did i say you can

1663
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:35,533
Kiss me?

1664
01:19:35,833 --> 01:19:36,667
kiss you?

1665
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:39,433
I'm trying to bite you.

1666
01:19:41,700 --> 01:19:43,200
Please, richard,

1667
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:45,200
I want you so bad.

1668
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:48,233

1669
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:52,867

i know what you mean.

1678
01:20:22,733 --> 01:20:23,700

slow music?

1682
01:20:29,733 --> 01:20:31,400

Well...

1690
01:23:02,067 --> 01:23:04,267
Maybe you should go home.

01:23:05,900 --> 01:23:06,967
yeah.

1692
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:17,933

no, she...

1724
01:24:20,300 --> 01:24:22,067
She stopped caring.

1749
01:25:06,567 --> 01:25:07,367

[paper rustling].

1751
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:17,067
Why is it you never

1752
01:25:17,067 --> 01:25:18,367
Let me kiss you

1753
01:25:19,167 --> 01:25:20,233
Or touch you?

1754
01:25:22,167 --> 01:25:24,067
i'm afraid if we...

1755
01:25:25,733 --> 01:25:27,100
I'm afraid if i...

1756
01:25:32,267 --> 01:25:32,867
I'm afraid you might

1757
01:25:32,867 --> 01:25:33,933
Disappear.

1758
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:37,367
so, what are we exactly?

1759
01:25:37,367 --> 01:25:39,433
I mean we're not lovers.

1760
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:44,067
friends, i guess,

1761
01:25:44,067 --> 01:25:45,300
Very good friends.

1762
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:46,167
friends do not do

1763
01:25:46,167 --> 01:25:47,067
What we do.

1764
01:25:47,967 --> 01:25:48,867
Why don't you stop trying

1765
01:25:48,867 --> 01:25:49,733
To make this less than

1766
01:25:49,733 --> 01:25:50,533
What it is?

1767
01:25:52,733 --> 01:25:54,900

you scared me.

1780

Get out!

1781
01:27:15,967 --> 01:27:17,467
let me see your face.

1782
01:27:17,467 --> 01:27:18,067
mike, we shouldn't

1783
01:27:18,067 --> 01:27:19,167
Be doing this.

1784

You're just so beautiful.

mike, no.

1787
01:27:23,167 --> 01:27:24,333
This is wrong.

1788
01:27:24,333 --> 01:27:26,067
You got to stop this.

1789
01:27:26,700 --> 01:27:28,700
[moaning].

1790
01:27:35,433 --> 01:27:38,067
i remember the time when...

1791
01:27:40,433 --> 01:27:41,333
Getting married

1792
01:27:41,333 --> 01:27:43,367
And spending the rest

1793
01:27:43,367 --> 01:27:45,533
Of our lives together was

1794
01:27:47,867 --> 01:27:48,467
The greatest thought

1795
01:27:48,467 --> 01:27:50,067
In the whole world.

1796
01:27:55,167 --> 01:27:56,533
And now...

1797
01:28:00,933 --> 01:28:03,267
Getting a divorce is...

1798
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:05,533
Is the only way we can

1799
01:28:05,533 --> 01:28:06,600
Stay friends.

1800
01:28:07,900 --> 01:28:09,600

1801
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:15,600

Beth...

1804
01:28:21,267 --> 01:28:23,367
won't you sign the papers?

1805
01:28:23,367 --> 01:28:24,267
how can you say that

1806
01:28:24,267 --> 01:28:26,567
After what just happened?

1807
01:28:26,967 --> 01:28:27,567
Come on.

1808
01:28:27,567 --> 01:28:28,133
Maybe we're making

1809
01:28:28,133 --> 01:28:28,667
A mistake.

1810
01:28:28,667 --> 01:28:29,867
mike, you don't get it,

1811
01:28:29,867 --> 01:28:30,633
Do you?

1812
01:28:31,667 --> 01:28:32,267
You said we are not

1813
01:28:32,267 --> 01:28:34,367
Getting back together.

1814
01:28:37,367 --> 01:28:38,233
It's just sex,

1815
01:28:38,233 --> 01:28:39,967
Not a relationship.

1816
01:28:45,767 --> 01:28:46,867

1817
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:52,433

01:28:53,533 --> 01:28:56,400
no, she's asleep.

1819
01:28:59,633 --> 01:29:00,933
I checked in on her

1820
01:29:00,933 --> 01:29:02,867
Right before i called.

1821
01:29:04,767 --> 01:29:05,533

i don't expect you to be.

1827
01:29:32,167 --> 01:29:33,667
I tried to warn you.

1828
01:29:33,667 --> 01:29:35,100
Even beth did.

1829
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:35,633

Place for a long time.

1834
01:29:46,433 --> 01:29:48,600
It just has to be this way.

1835
01:29:49,333 --> 01:29:50,833
am i just some kind of toy?

1836
01:29:50,833 --> 01:29:51,767
Is that what it is?

1837
01:29:51,767 --> 01:29:52,333
Just some kind of little

1838
01:29:52,333 --> 01:29:54,100

It's not you, shelley.

Just walk away?

1853
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:14,100

To make love and i felt

So beautiful being pregnant,
