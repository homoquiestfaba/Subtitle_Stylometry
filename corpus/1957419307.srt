1
00:00:26,233 --> 00:00:28,400
Woman:
Good morning, HBO.

2
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,967
I'll see if he's in.

3
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,300
Hi.
How can I help you?

4
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,767
Jeff Greene and Larry David
to see Allan Wasserman.

5
00:00:35,767 --> 00:00:37,934
- I'll let him know
you're here.
- Thank you.

6
00:00:40,467 --> 00:00:43,166
Woman:
Larry David and Jeff Greene
are here for Allan.

7
00:00:55,133 --> 00:00:57,233
For the most part,
I mean, the industry knew

8
00:00:57,233 --> 00:01:00,133
there was a Larry David
behind "Seinfeld."

9
00:01:00,133 --> 00:01:01,900
But the average guy
on the street didn't know

10
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,233
that the funny stuff
coming out of our mouths

11
00:01:04,233 --> 00:01:06,700
were coming out of a guy
named Larry David.

12
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,133
Rick:
Well, he is a comedian.

13
00:01:08,133 --> 00:01:10,767
He's taken that talent
and turned it into writing,

14
00:01:10,767 --> 00:01:13,233
but, I mean,
he did start his career
as a stand-up comedian.

15
00:01:13,233 --> 00:01:15,300
Jerry:
His standard opening
was always,

16
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,000
"I'll tell you something
about good-looking people--

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,567
we're not well-liked."

18
00:01:20,567 --> 00:01:24,066
And then he would always call
the audience "you people."

19
00:01:24,066 --> 00:01:26,000
And I used to say to him,

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,800
"You know, calling them
'you people,'

21
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,367
it's a bit distancing,
you know?

22
00:01:31,367 --> 00:01:33,900
It's kind of like
you're already putting them

23
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,900
in an adversarial position."

24
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,400
Not often,
but from time to time,

25
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,467
Larry would actually
get up onstage,

26
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:44,967
grab the microphone,
do a very slow 180,

27
00:01:44,967 --> 00:01:49,767
looking at the audience
from left to right,

28
00:01:49,767 --> 00:01:51,767
surveying them.

29
00:01:51,767 --> 00:01:56,100
Take the microphone,
put it back in the stand
and go, "Never mind,"

30
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,100
and would walk off stage.

31
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,533
And the audience
never knew what hit them.

32
00:02:00,533 --> 00:02:01,800
He was a phenomenon.

33
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,033
He just couldn't
get over the hump

34
00:02:04,033 --> 00:02:08,066
that comedians have to perform
in front of other people.

35
00:02:08,066 --> 00:02:09,867
Carol:
Larry's take was always
so different

36
00:02:09,867 --> 00:02:12,100
and definitely
not mainstream.

37
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:16,500
And he kind of took
that attitude and put it
into a sitcom,

38
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,400
and I think it made the show
revolutionary.

39
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,800
Jason:
There was an episode
pretty early on--

40
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,066
George was
doing something and I said,
"Guys, you gotta help me.

41
00:02:27,066 --> 00:02:30,800
This is a rewrite situation
because this would never
happen in real life,

42
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,033
but certainly,
if it did happen in real life,

43
00:02:33,033 --> 00:02:34,734
no one would react
like this."

44
00:02:34,734 --> 00:02:37,233
And Larry came up
and he said,

45
00:02:37,233 --> 00:02:40,033
"This happened
to me and this is exactly
what I did, you know."

46
00:02:40,033 --> 00:02:42,533
"Oh, okay."

47
00:02:42,533 --> 00:02:44,500
And actually, that was
the turning point for me.

48
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,533
And from that point on,
I geared myself up for doing

49
00:02:48,533 --> 00:02:51,166
as shameless
a Larry David imitation
as I could muster.

50
00:02:53,233 --> 00:02:55,200
Glenn:
He was stuck with success.

51
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,567
For the first time
in his life,

52
00:02:56,567 --> 00:02:58,066
he was stuck.

53
00:02:58,066 --> 00:03:01,033
It was a hit
and it was like
he always acted

54
00:03:01,033 --> 00:03:02,900
like it was, like,
a major imposition on him

55
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,066
when the show got picked up
for a second season.

56
00:03:05,066 --> 00:03:06,900
I think once he saw
that "Seinfeld," especially,

57
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,133
would be successful,
I think he felt like

58
00:03:09,133 --> 00:03:10,900
the most fulfilling thing
he could do next

59
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,800
would be to return
to stand-up and complete
that unfinished business.

60
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,734
When he started talking to me
about setting up gigs for him
around town,

61
00:03:19,734 --> 00:03:22,433
I said, "Are you thinking
maybe you wanna do
an HBO special?"

62
00:03:22,433 --> 00:03:23,767
He goes, "I think
it's a little too soon."

63
00:03:23,767 --> 00:03:25,900
And I said, "Well, maybe
it's not a little too soon,

64
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,667
'cause I've got
this great idea."

65
00:03:34,967 --> 00:03:36,734
What is it?

66
00:03:36,734 --> 00:03:38,300
It's gonna be on us
all the time?

67
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,133
I mean, it's a little
intrusive, isn't it?

68
00:03:40,133 --> 00:03:42,266
Most of the time.
Most of the time, yeah.

69
00:03:42,266 --> 00:03:43,700
How are you supposed to sit
and have a conversation

70
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,700
with this thing
watching you all the time?

71
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,967
That's the point.

72
00:03:45,967 --> 00:03:47,300
They're gonna watch us
sit and have a conversation.

73
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,000
Forget that it's here.

74
00:03:51,367 --> 00:03:53,266
- No.

75
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:55,967
- I don't like gum.

76
00:03:55,967 --> 00:03:57,734
What's not to like?

77
00:03:57,734 --> 00:04:00,166
I don't know, I just don't--
I've never been a big gum guy.

78
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,433
See, you're--
this is good stuff, huh?

79
00:04:05,433 --> 00:04:08,734
Yeah, that's real good.
Yeah.

80
00:04:08,734 --> 00:04:10,333
Yeah, I'm glad
it's getting all this.

81
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,600
Yeah. Did you get
that gum story we just did?

82
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,633
'Cause that's--
that was really good.

83
00:04:14,633 --> 00:04:16,300
- Let me just say something
to you-- you'll be fine.
- Yeah.

84
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,600
- Woman: Gentlemen,
they're ready for you.
- Oh, thank you.

85
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,233
This-- I wish I wore
a different shirt.
I really can't--

86
00:04:21,233 --> 00:04:23,000
Well, brown and green
don't usually match,

87
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,300
but you got the yellow
to offset it.

88
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,033
You're okay.
Let's go, come on.

89
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:28,200
What do you think
of this shirt?

90
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,800
- Woman: You look great.

91
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,266
- We need to walk around
with a camera crew.
- Uh-huh.

92
00:04:38,033 --> 00:04:41,834
I have a tendency
to nod to black people.

93
00:04:41,834 --> 00:04:44,467
Why-- what reason
would you have to--

94
00:04:44,467 --> 00:04:47,734
I don't know.
I just find that
I nod to them.

95
00:04:47,734 --> 00:04:50,200
More so than white--
I haven't nodded
to white people.

96
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,900
I've never heard
of "white liberal
nodding guilt."

97
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,700
Yeah, it's a way
of kind of making
contact.

98
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:01,867
- Yeah.
- You know, like, "I'm okay.
I'm not one of the bad ones."

99
00:05:01,867 --> 00:05:04,166
Okay.

100
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:07,667
- Allan: Hey, look at that!
On the money! There he is.

101
00:05:07,667 --> 00:05:09,266
- Ah!

102
00:05:09,266 --> 00:05:11,333
So, so good
to be here.

103
00:05:12,867 --> 00:05:15,100
- So, talk to me.

104
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,300
All right, first off,
I wanna thank you
for allowing us

105
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,066
- to bring the cameras in
because--
- Oh, yeah.

106
00:05:20,066 --> 00:05:21,934
We're not self-conscious
at all about--

107
00:05:21,934 --> 00:05:25,767
- No, I feel
just like I always do.
- He's crazy about it, too.

108
00:05:25,767 --> 00:05:27,834
But, well,
let me explain.

109
00:05:27,834 --> 00:05:31,734
Larry hasn't done stand-up
in nine and a half years,
if you can believe that.

110
00:05:31,734 --> 00:05:33,133
- Okay.
- Judy: Wow.

111
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:35,300
And what
we wanna do is have
Larry perform again

112
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,200
and have it lead up
to an HBO special.

113
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,133
- Allan: Okay.
- Jeff: It being two parts.

114
00:05:39,133 --> 00:05:42,900
The first part would be
a documentary

115
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,734
of everything
that Larry has to do

116
00:05:45,734 --> 00:05:47,700
to prepare
for the special--

117
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,633
the sets at the clubs,
time alone with his family,

118
00:05:51,633 --> 00:05:54,100
walking down the street,
whatever it is.

119
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,834
We're going to see
how he prepares for it
leading up to the special,

120
00:05:56,834 --> 00:06:00,633
and then the actual special,
which would be just him doing
straight ahead stand-up.

121
00:06:00,633 --> 00:06:03,100
Come on, seriously.
 No.

122
00:06:05,767 --> 00:06:07,867
Where do you want
to do this, specifically?

123
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,400
Jeff:
Definitely New York
and Los Angeles.

124
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,567
And we'll probably film
the special in Los Angeles.

125
00:06:12,567 --> 00:06:16,266
- Okay.
- And is it-- this is
straight stand

126
00:06:16,266 --> 00:06:17,767
Because, you know,
on our specials,

127
00:06:17,767 --> 00:06:19,567
we're not limited
to just stand--

128
00:06:19,567 --> 00:06:24,233
like, if you wanted to do
some sketches or any kind
of, you know--

129
00:06:24,233 --> 00:06:27,200
- Cameos, guests,
people with you--
- Yeah, little skits that--

130
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,834
beforehand
that you might wanna--

131
00:06:28,834 --> 00:06:30,900
you certainly have
some great stories
from the last nine years.

132
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,367
I have a lot of stories
about my childhood
in Oklahoma.

133
00:06:35,033 --> 00:06:39,033
Very homespun,
and I think they'll go over.

134
00:06:39,033 --> 00:06:42,333
- And I wear a cowboy hat.

135
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:44,266
- Um, Larry...
- Yeah.

136
00:06:44,266 --> 00:06:48,033
...do you have
any-- did you do
any of the comedy shows,

137
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:49,900
you know, like,
"MTV Half Hour Comedy Hour"?

138
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,433
- Any tape that we could...
- No, nothing.

139
00:06:51,433 --> 00:06:52,633
...take a look at
to see your stuff?

140
00:06:52,633 --> 00:06:54,800
No, there's not even
any home movies or anything.

141
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,133
- Is there any film
of you doing stand-up--

142
00:06:57,133 --> 00:06:58,300
No, there's
no film on me at all.

143
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,066
In fact, I'm going
to kill this guy

144
00:07:01,066 --> 00:07:02,600
as soon as I get out
of this meeting.

145
00:07:12,867 --> 00:07:14,834
- You didn't nod to her.
- I tried to, but she--

146
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:16,533
- She went by too fast.
- She went by too fast.

147
00:07:16,533 --> 00:07:18,700
Yeah, yeah.

148
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,633
That's gonna be
a tough habit to break.

149
00:07:21,633 --> 00:07:24,467
That was good.
I'm real happy with that.
That was good.

150
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,367
- Hey, hey.

151
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:32,033
Good.
How are you, Jeff?

152
00:07:32,033 --> 00:07:33,734
- That's right, Jeff Yerkes.
Good to see you.
- Yeah, I got it.

153
00:07:33,734 --> 00:07:36,467
- Yeah, Jeff Yerkes,
Jeff Greene, my manager.

154
00:07:36,467 --> 00:07:37,700
Good to meet you.
How are you?

155
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,700
Jeff was
the writer's assistant
on "Seinfeld."

156
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,000
Hey, good.
How about that?

157
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
- It was a great gig.
Yeah.
- Yeah.

158
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,333
I actually--
you know, it's funny,
I was gonna give you a call.

159
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:49,400
Um, I need a bit of a favor,
if you don't mind.

160
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,667
- Yeah, what--
- It's not a big one.

161
00:07:50,667 --> 00:07:52,166
- Good.
- All right,
so here it is, right?

162
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:55,333
I have the possibility
of a job at Warner Bros.

163
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:56,700
doing development
over there

164
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,100
and I kind of want
to get out of here.

165
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,700
And I was wondering
if you could give

166
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,633
Michael Weingrad
a phone call.

167
00:08:02,633 --> 00:08:04,900
Kind of, you know,
boost me up a little bit,

168
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,767
tell him that
I'm a good employee and--

169
00:08:06,767 --> 00:08:08,266
That's something you'd do.
You should do that.

170
00:08:08,266 --> 00:08:10,266
That I would be
more than happy to do.

171
00:08:10,266 --> 00:08:11,333
That would be
really great.

172
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:12,533
I mean, coming from you,
you know...

173
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,133
- Oh, stop it.
- ...somebody of your stature...

174
00:08:14,133 --> 00:08:16,400
- I have no stature.
- ...I think that would
really--

175
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,367
No stature.
Please, stop.

176
00:08:18,367 --> 00:08:19,500
That would put me
over the top.

177
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,700
- Yeah, absolutely.

178
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,166
I'd be more than happy
to do it.

179
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,433
- I'm happy to do it.
- That's fantastic. Great.

180
00:08:23,433 --> 00:08:25,567
Yeah. You'll get out
of this hellhole that's HBO.

181
00:08:25,567 --> 00:08:26,967
Oh, please,
tell me about it.

182
00:08:26,967 --> 00:08:28,900
All right. Well, good.
Nice meeting you, man.

183
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,000
- Nice meeting you, Jeff.
- Yeah.

184
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,367
Thank you so much, seriously.
This means a lot. It does.

185
00:08:34,367 --> 00:08:36,667
- Jeff Yerkes: Take care.
- So long.

186
00:08:36,667 --> 00:08:38,867
- Take care.

187
00:08:38,867 --> 00:08:41,467
- That's nice.
You'll call for him.
- Yeah.

188
00:08:41,467 --> 00:08:44,300
10 seconds earlier,
I could've gotten
in the elevator.

189
00:08:45,667 --> 00:08:48,400
It is both shocking
and absolutely sensible

190
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,867
for Larry to go back
into stand-up.

191
00:08:51,867 --> 00:08:56,233
It's shocking in that
I didn't think he liked it
very much.

192
00:08:56,233 --> 00:08:58,166
I don't think
you're really aware

193
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:00,000
of how bad the clubs
have become,

194
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,066
like, in the last--
when's the last time
you went onstage?

195
00:09:02,066 --> 00:09:03,533
- 10 years ago.
- Oh.

196
00:09:03,533 --> 00:09:05,500
- They scream,
they yell shit out.
- They talk.

197
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,333
They heckle you
constantly.

198
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:09,033
You know
how many times I've heard,
"Show me your tits"?

199
00:09:09,033 --> 00:09:10,533
You know how many times
I've heard that?

200
00:09:10,533 --> 00:09:11,633
- I've heard that, too.

201
00:09:11,633 --> 00:09:12,900
I've heard that
a million times.

202
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,600
I hear that all the time.
You don't believe us.

203
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,200
You haven't
been out there.

204
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,633
Mike and I are still
on the road.

205
00:09:19,633 --> 00:09:21,934
- Yeah. Yeah.
- You know how stupid
these people are?

206
00:09:21,934 --> 00:09:24,467
I have two words
for you-- dick jokes.

207
00:09:24,467 --> 00:09:27,533
- Yeah.
- Plenty of dick jokes.

208
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:29,633
- You're gonna need that.
- I've got plenty
of dick jokes.

209
00:09:29,633 --> 00:09:31,433
- You have plenty
of dick jokes?
- Yeah.

210
00:09:31,433 --> 00:09:33,800
- You have
plenty of dick jokes?
- I started the dick joke thing.

211
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,667
- You did not. Oh!
- I did so.

212
00:09:35,667 --> 00:09:38,033
- You know, that is so--
- Don't you remember that
"I hate my penis" routine

213
00:09:38,033 --> 00:09:39,200
I used to do?
Come on.

214
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,133
- All right, the masturbator.

215
00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:42,567
- I'll give you
the masturbator.
- Yeah. Right. Okay.

216
00:09:42,567 --> 00:09:43,767
- Hi.
- Hey.

217
00:09:43,767 --> 00:09:44,767
- Just wanted to say hi.
- Hi.

218
00:09:44,767 --> 00:09:45,767
Hi. How are you?

219
00:09:45,767 --> 00:09:47,567
Caroline,
you know Suzy, Mike.

220
00:09:47,567 --> 00:09:49,834
It's "Carol-line."
Doesn't matter.

221
00:09:49,834 --> 00:09:52,000
Have a nice meal.
Just wanted to say hi.

222
00:09:55,367 --> 00:09:56,633
You know, that whole...

223
00:09:56,633 --> 00:09:59,333
You know, when people make
a fuss about their name,

224
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,367
- That's a bit weird.

225
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:02,834
"Carol-lynn,"
"Carol-line."

226
00:10:02,834 --> 00:10:04,834
But you know what,
she's on a show now.
She's, you know...

227
00:10:04,834 --> 00:10:06,266
Mike:
What are you
gonna call yourself?

228
00:10:06,266 --> 00:10:08,033
What's gonna be your name?
Just Larry David?

229
00:10:08,033 --> 00:10:09,834
I'm "Leary."
I'm gonna tell her
I'm "Leary."

230
00:10:09,834 --> 00:10:12,000
- Yeah. Can you take
those sunglasses off?

231
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,100
I'm not taking them off.
Get off of it.

232
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,367
You've been
telling me this since we--

233
00:10:15,367 --> 00:10:16,600
Well, what are you
wearing them for?

234
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,734
Why can't I wear
sunglasses inside?

235
00:10:17,734 --> 00:10:19,100
You know who wears
sunglasses inside?

236
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,400
Blind people
and assholes.

237
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,333
Okay, fine,
I'm an asshole,
all right?

238
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,333
-  He's changed.

239
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,767
Larry Charles:
He doesn't take
criticism well.

240
00:10:25,767 --> 00:10:27,200
He doesn't suffer
fools gladly,

241
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,767
doesn't take
criticism well.

242
00:10:28,767 --> 00:10:31,200
I think once he believes
in what he's doing,

243
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,667
he cannot be deterred.

244
00:10:32,667 --> 00:10:36,600
So any external criticism
is useless to him.

245
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,400
Hi, I'm calling
for Michael Weingrad.

246
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,133
Larry David.

247
00:10:45,066 --> 00:10:47,867
I really resent that,
that "who's calling?"

248
00:10:47,867 --> 00:10:50,367
You know, like some people
are good enough to make the cut.

249
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,467
Yeah, hi.

250
00:10:54,467 --> 00:10:56,567
Um, my name's Larry David,

251
00:10:56,567 --> 00:11:00,800
and I used to be
the executive producer
on the "Seinfeld" show.

252
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:07,200
Well, I don't really know
what to say to that.

253
00:11:09,233 --> 00:11:13,200
Anyway, I'm calling
on behalf of Jeff Yerkes,

254
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,166
who's applying
for a position in development.

255
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,834
Um, no, you know,
I worked--

256
00:11:19,834 --> 00:11:21,200
he worked for me
for a couple of years.

257
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,633
He's a--
you know, I gotta say,

258
00:11:23,633 --> 00:11:26,367
that's a very weird thing
that you said to me.

259
00:11:27,567 --> 00:11:29,834
Well, "Never watch it,
not a fan"?

260
00:11:31,934 --> 00:11:35,500
That's-- well, it's--
yeah, of course.

261
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,533
I just think
it's a stupid thing
to say to somebody.

262
00:11:38,533 --> 00:11:41,834
Well, what reason
would you have to say that?

263
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:44,800
I don't know,
I'm just calling up
to put in a word for this guy

264
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,266
and then I hear this,
"Never watch it, not a fan."

265
00:11:48,934 --> 00:11:52,166
Look, hey,
I don't wanna get--

266
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:56,166
I-- all I'm saying is
it's a dumb thing to say.

267
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,767
Fine.
Thank you.

268
00:11:59,767 --> 00:12:01,800
Thank you very much.
Good-bye.

269
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,967
Yes.
Good-bye!

270
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:07,266
Did you hang up on him?

271
00:12:07,266 --> 00:12:09,400
Well, we sort of
hung up on each other.

272
00:12:11,633 --> 00:12:14,133
And so what happened
with the kid?

273
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:16,000
I don't know
what's gonna happen.

274
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,467
I don't know.

275
00:12:18,934 --> 00:12:21,367
I tried to call back,
but they wouldn't take
the call.

276
00:12:21,367 --> 00:12:24,100
But how did
you ask for him?

277
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:28,166
Were you-- did you--
had you changed your attitude
by then when you called back,

278
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:29,834
or were you just like,
"Ah, it's Larry David"?

279
00:12:29,834 --> 00:12:31,400
I don't know why
you're blaming this on me.

280
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,000
- I'm just curious.
- The guy insulted me.

281
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,033
You should be
defending me.

282
00:12:34,033 --> 00:12:36,066
Well, it--
you know what, it was--

283
00:12:36,066 --> 00:12:37,867
that wasn't nice of him
to say that, but...

284
00:12:37,867 --> 00:12:38,934
Yes, I know.

285
00:12:38,934 --> 00:12:40,834
But  here's this guy

286
00:12:40,834 --> 00:12:44,667
who's trying to get a job,
and what have you done?

287
00:12:44,667 --> 00:12:47,633
What have I done?
I haven't done anything?

288
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:50,100
I was insulted.
Don't you see that?

289
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,600
But, I mean,
are you gonna write him
a letter now or something?

290
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,100
Write him a letter.
"Dear Prick"...

291
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:00,000
- Okay,
that's not gonna help.
- "I'm sorry--

292
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,800
I'm sorry
you're a prick."

293
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,633
- "I didn't know that you were
such a prick when I called."

294
00:13:04,633 --> 00:13:08,200
- Okay.
- "But it really turned out
that you were.

295
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,133
- In any event..."
- I think this guy--

296
00:13:10,133 --> 00:13:12,967
"...could you please
give this young man a job?"

297
00:13:12,967 --> 00:13:15,467
- He asked the wrong person.

298
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,033
I don't know...

299
00:13:19,033 --> 00:13:20,700
I-- people
used to like me.

300
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,000
Then all of a sudden...

301
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,200
I don't know
how it's evolved like this,

302
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,700
but I used to have friends
who really liked me.

303
00:13:30,233 --> 00:13:32,066
Not women, but friends.

304
00:13:32,066 --> 00:13:35,233
- Yeah, guys liked me.

305
00:13:38,233 --> 00:13:42,433
I'm beginning to sense
a whole wave of--
of antipathy.

306
00:13:42,433 --> 00:13:45,233
A big wave of antipathy.

307
00:13:45,233 --> 00:13:49,500
And now there will be
millions of other people
joining in on that wave.

308
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,567
Well, you invited
this whole  thing in.

309
00:13:53,567 --> 00:13:55,266
This was your whole idea.

310
00:13:55,266 --> 00:13:57,500
It wasn't my idea,
it was Jeff's idea.

311
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,667
Well, hello.

312
00:13:59,667 --> 00:14:01,800
Any manager
has the problem

313
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,333
of dealing with
their client's spouse,

314
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,166
because the spouse
always thinks

315
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:09,734
that they're making
the better decision
than the manager.

316
00:14:12,734 --> 00:14:15,834
Some people just rub you
the wrong way.

317
00:14:15,834 --> 00:14:19,433
Yeah-huh.
And, uh...

318
00:14:19,433 --> 00:14:21,800
that's how I feel
about Jeff.

319
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,633
I just feel like...

320
00:14:24,633 --> 00:14:28,600
I'm not sure he's always
thinking about Larry.

321
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,467
Oh, you're kidding me.

322
00:14:31,467 --> 00:14:32,934
Does my wife know?

323
00:14:37,867 --> 00:14:39,066
Yeah.

324
00:14:40,233 --> 00:14:42,767
So
did she know that?

325
00:14:45,033 --> 00:14:48,467
Oh, so that
was gonna-- oh, gosh.

326
00:14:49,767 --> 00:14:51,367
Just tell my wife.
She'll stay.

327
00:14:51,367 --> 00:14:52,834
Excuse me.

328
00:14:54,266 --> 00:14:55,500
Mm-hmm.

329
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,300
I'll talk to you later.
Bye-bye.

330
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,667
Can I ask you a question?

331
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:02,100
You know I'm in the room,
why don't you-- how come

332
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,133
you don't pick your head up
just to, you know, say,

333
00:15:04,133 --> 00:15:05,233
"Oh, one second,"
or something?

334
00:15:05,233 --> 00:15:06,700
Because
I'm in the middle of--

335
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,133
I'm giving them my attention
when I'm on the phone.

336
00:15:08,133 --> 00:15:09,633
I give you attention
when you're in here.

337
00:15:09,633 --> 00:15:13,000
I know, but all you have to do
is just go, "One second."

338
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,300
You know,
when I'm on the phone,

339
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,367
if I'm going like this
and somebody comes in,

340
00:15:16,367 --> 00:15:18,734
I go, "One second.
One second."

341
00:15:18,734 --> 00:15:20,700
And then I can go back
to looking down.

342
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,000
But then-- but then
if I say, "One second,"

343
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,033
they on the other end
know the attention's
not on them.

344
00:15:25,033 --> 00:15:28,166
You don't have to say,
"One second," you just--

345
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:31,033
- Like that.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

346
00:15:31,033 --> 00:15:35,533
Caroline Rhea called--
well, I talk to her
every morning.

347
00:15:35,533 --> 00:15:39,667
- Oh, Jesus.
- Um, she said you saw her.

348
00:15:39,667 --> 00:15:40,934
Yeah.

349
00:15:40,934 --> 00:15:45,300
And, uh, well, first off,
you called her "Carol

350
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,600
- Oh, my God.
- Why would you
call her "Carol

351
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,066
You know her name's
"Carol-line."

352
00:15:49,066 --> 00:15:51,033
You know,
"Carol-lynn," "Carol-line."
Is there a big difference?

353
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:53,166
You gotta start
paying attention to details
because it's people's names.

354
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:54,467
They get hurt.

355
00:15:54,467 --> 00:15:56,834
The other thing is
you didn't say good-bye
to her.

356
00:15:57,967 --> 00:15:59,600
I didn't say good-bye
to her?

357
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,700
She came over
to the table...

358
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,900
She was upset.
I talked to her.
She was upset.

359
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,700
She says, "First the name
and then he didn't say
good-bye to me."

360
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,367
- She came over
to the table, okay?
- Uh-huh.

361
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:08,834
She came over,
it was uncomfortable.

362
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:10,567
She corrected me
on the Caroline.

363
00:16:10,567 --> 00:16:13,433
We talked a little bit,
then she went to her table.

364
00:16:13,433 --> 00:16:15,700
Now, am I obligated
to go to her table now
to say good

365
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,333
I've already said hello.

366
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:19,967
Do I have to say
hello and good
Why do I have to do both?

367
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,667
Can you just give her a call
whenever you have time?

368
00:16:21,667 --> 00:16:23,433
I'm not gonna call--

369
00:16:23,433 --> 00:16:25,066
Just call up,
say, "Hey!"

370
00:16:25,066 --> 00:16:27,100
That's all I do, is apologize.
All day long I'm apologizing.

371
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,834
It'd be
a big favor to me
if you did.

372
00:16:29,834 --> 00:16:34,100
It's very hard to do
the right thing all the time,
24 hours a day.

373
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:37,734
People are so touchy about
all these little stupid things
that go on.

374
00:16:37,734 --> 00:16:39,233
Constantly.
You know, it's tough--

375
00:16:39,233 --> 00:16:42,467
It doesn't even pay
to leave your house.
What's the point?

376
00:16:42,467 --> 00:16:46,433
I don't really see Larry,
in the past,

377
00:16:46,433 --> 00:16:48,066
as being someone secure.

378
00:16:48,066 --> 00:16:51,533
It'll be interesting to see
how he gets up onstage now.

379
00:16:54,533 --> 00:16:57,100
Interviewer:
Do you know precisely
what your act will be tonight?

380
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,166
Are you-- how much of it
is improvised,

381
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:02,667
how much of it is--
do you know exactly
what your set's going to be?

382
00:17:02,667 --> 00:17:05,166
I have an idea,
but, um...

383
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,166
I don't really know
the material at all.

384
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:11,433
Uh-huh. Will that
be a hindrance,
do you think?

385
00:17:11,433 --> 00:17:13,900
I don't think
it's gonna be a help.

386
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,567
- Cheryl: Larry, honey.
- Yeah.

387
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:16,967
We need to go.

388
00:17:16,967 --> 00:17:18,233
We need to go.

389
00:17:18,233 --> 00:17:19,800
Oh, yeah,
you're all revved up,
aren't you?

390
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,166
Yeah, you're gonna
be late.

391
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,600
- All right.
- Okay.

392
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,033
- Okay.
- So...

393
00:17:24,033 --> 00:17:25,734
All right, you'll be
laughing there, right?

394
00:17:25,734 --> 00:17:26,834
- Yeah.
- Okay.

395
00:17:26,834 --> 00:17:28,200
I don't wanna walk out
without you.

396
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,800
- All right. All right.

397
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,467
He was interviewing me,
and I had a very long brush.

398
00:17:36,633 --> 00:17:38,333
Man:
This next performer

399
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:40,600
is returning
to stand-up comedy
after a 10-year absence.

400
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,233
Please welcome
Larry David.

401
00:17:50,633 --> 00:17:52,000
Thank you,
thank you.

402
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,934
I think I'm gonna do
very well tonight,
I really do.

403
00:17:57,133 --> 00:18:00,567
I'm feeling
just unbelievably confident.

404
00:18:00,567 --> 00:18:03,734
Well... that was a bad start.
It was a bad start.

405
00:18:05,233 --> 00:18:08,533
A really stupid start.
I don't know why I did that.

406
00:18:08,533 --> 00:18:09,867
Ah, you know,
you'll see.

407
00:18:11,834 --> 00:18:13,667
Well, you've been--
you seem like a very nice
audience tonight.

408
00:18:13,667 --> 00:18:17,567
I'm wondering,
in case I break into
some Spanish or French,

409
00:18:17,567 --> 00:18:21,433
may I use the familiar
tu  form with you people?

410
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,300
Instead of usted,
because I think usted

411
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,400
is gonna be a little
too formal for this crowd.

412
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,600
I feel already
I've established
the kind of rapport

413
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,166
that I can jump
into the tu  form with you.

414
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:33,300
That quickly.
I'm taking a tu  liberty
with you.

415
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,834
I'm gonna use the tu  form,
and that's it.

416
00:18:34,834 --> 00:18:36,166
You can't talk me
out of it.

417
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,633
You know, Caesar used
the tu  form with Brutus,

418
00:18:39,633 --> 00:18:41,734
even after Brutus
stabbed him.

419
00:18:41,734 --> 00:18:43,066
He said,
"Et tu, Brute,"

420
00:18:43,066 --> 00:18:44,667
and I think that's
a little too informal

421
00:18:44,667 --> 00:18:47,266
when someone's trying
to assassinate you.

422
00:18:47,266 --> 00:18:51,834
I think at that point,
perhaps, usted--  he would've
been better off.

423
00:18:51,834 --> 00:18:53,600
But that's Caesar.

424
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,800
That's crazy, wacky,
mixed-up Julius Caesar.

425
00:18:59,533 --> 00:19:02,400
He has tremendous conviction
about what he thinks is funny,

426
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,533
and at the same time,

427
00:19:04,533 --> 00:19:07,033
he'll just crush
like an egg.

428
00:19:07,033 --> 00:19:09,000
Like an empty shell.

429
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,934
- Honey.
- Hey.

430
00:19:10,934 --> 00:19:12,433
- That was great!

431
00:19:12,433 --> 00:19:14,200
- Yes! Yes!

432
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,767
- Yeah.

433
00:19:15,767 --> 00:19:16,867
How do you feel?

434
00:19:16,867 --> 00:19:18,967
You know,
I feel okay.

435
00:19:18,967 --> 00:19:21,166
There are a few things
that didn't-- didn't work.

436
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:22,166
Yeah.

437
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:23,633
- Yeah, I know.

438
00:19:23,633 --> 00:19:25,667
- I mean--
- No, I know
what didn't work.

439
00:19:25,667 --> 00:19:27,066
You don't have to, you know--
I know what didn't work.

440
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:29,300
But I just-- I wrote
some stuff down in case--

441
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,700
you know, in case
we want to go back
through it and...

442
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:36,066
- You said pussy a lot.
- I didn't say it a lot.

443
00:19:36,066 --> 00:19:39,033
I said it
when it was appropriate
for the material.

444
00:19:39,033 --> 00:19:40,500
Yeah, but it was
still a lot.

445
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,500
It didn't add to--
it didn't make it funnier.

446
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,934
- Jeff: Hey! Hey!
- Hey!

447
00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:45,266
That was great.

448
00:19:45,266 --> 00:19:46,800
- Oh, thank you, thank you.
- That was unbelievable.

449
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,333
- Man, 10--
wasn't he great?
- Yeah.

450
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,300
- She thinks
I said pussy too much.
- A little too much.

451
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:53,266
Oh, no, you said--
you can say it more.

452
00:19:53,266 --> 00:19:55,867
- No, pussy's great.
 You can't say
pussy enough.

453
00:19:55,867 --> 00:19:57,467
You can't say pussy--
pussy's a good comedy word.

454
00:19:57,467 --> 00:20:00,133
Okay, great.
I'm gonna wait inside.

455
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:01,166
It's good
to see you again.

456
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,133
Great, yeah.
So, I'll see you soon.

457
00:20:03,133 --> 00:20:05,567
Okay, well,
just give me five minutes,
and then we'll go.

458
00:20:05,567 --> 00:20:07,133
- Okay.
- All right.

459
00:20:07,133 --> 00:20:09,700
I'll talk about
your act in a second.
She doesn't like me.

460
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,633
No.
- She doesn't like me.

461
00:20:11,633 --> 00:20:13,900
- No, don't say that. No.

462
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,834
I was stupid even to agree
on the pussy thing.

463
00:20:15,834 --> 00:20:18,500
- Man: Great set, Larry.
- Oh, thank you.
She likes you.

464
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:22,333
But, um...
talk about you.
Great set, great set.

465
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:23,567
It was
a great set.

466
00:20:23,567 --> 00:20:25,533
Hey! Hey!

467
00:20:25,533 --> 00:20:27,567
Larry, I'm Caroline Rhea.
Have we met?

468
00:20:27,567 --> 00:20:29,900
Yeah, Caroline.
Why do you make such
a big deal about your name?

469
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,000
- Because it's my name.

470
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,033
It's how I respond.

471
00:20:33,033 --> 00:20:34,300
People say it,
and then I turn around.

472
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,200
What's the difference,
Lynn, Line?

473
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,467
- I've never
mispronounced your name.
- Hi, Larry, Dave, whatever.

474
00:20:38,467 --> 00:20:39,967
You can call me any--
I don't care

475
00:20:39,967 --> 00:20:42,066
if you call me
"Leary" or Larry,
it doesn't matter.

476
00:20:42,066 --> 00:20:43,767
All right,
it's no big deal.

477
00:20:43,767 --> 00:20:45,000
- Jeff: Yeah,
it's no big deal.
- It's fine.

478
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,800
I do apologize
for not coming over
to say good-bye.

479
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:50,133
That I should've done,
even though the hello
was really good.

480
00:20:50,133 --> 00:20:52,033
- It wasn't that good.

481
00:20:52,033 --> 00:20:55,100
- It was a good hello.
- It wasn't such a good hello
that it equaled a good-bye.

482
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,333
I gave you a nice hello,
and I just forgot--

483
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:58,567
I forgot
to say good-bye.

484
00:20:58,567 --> 00:21:01,100
- I'm sorry.

485
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,633
You were great tonight,
but I would try and use
the word pussy more.

486
00:21:03,633 --> 00:21:05,033
I think the kids
really liked it.

487
00:21:05,033 --> 00:21:06,800
Wait a second,
don't go, don't go.
Don't be mad.

488
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,633
Oh, don't leave
and not say good

489
00:21:08,633 --> 00:21:10,533
I would never do
something like that.

490
00:21:10,533 --> 00:21:13,900
- Good-bye, Laurie.
- "Carol-lynn. Carol-lynn."

491
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,233
Caroline?

492
00:21:31,633 --> 00:21:35,066
Hey, Ed,
I'll see you tomorrow.

493
00:21:35,066 --> 00:21:36,667
I thought I'm gonna
see you tonight.

494
00:21:36,667 --> 00:21:39,467
- I'm gonna see you later.

495
00:21:39,467 --> 00:21:41,400
- The thing.

496
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,900
Mark's father.

497
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,100
- Oh.
- He's dead.
He passed away.

498
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,734
The thing,
the condolence thing.

499
00:21:46,734 --> 00:21:49,166
- Of course I'm going.

500
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:52,433
I told him, you know,
I'll be there.

501
00:21:52,433 --> 00:21:55,133
- You come with me.
- I can't be around
mourners.

502
00:21:55,133 --> 00:21:56,133
It's...

503
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,367
I feel like
they're gonna
lash out at me,

504
00:21:59,367 --> 00:22:01,934
tell me, you know,
what they think of me.

505
00:22:01,934 --> 00:22:03,600
They'll take this
as an opportunity

506
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,400
to tell me
what they think of me.

507
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,800
I can't--
look, this is--
you know Mark,

508
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,166
and I know even though
you don't know him well,

509
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:13,567
you'll come with me
for 10 minutes.

510
00:22:13,567 --> 00:22:15,000
It's not gonna hurt
anything.

511
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,433
I don't even know--
why are you going?

512
00:22:16,433 --> 00:22:17,900
Why did you tell him
you were going?

513
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,500
I mean, it's not
even his father.

514
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,800
It's his stepfather.

515
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,500
His father's still alive.

516
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,567
I mean, this is a step.

517
00:22:25,567 --> 00:22:27,100
I already dug a ditch
for myself, though.

518
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,467
How can I get
out of it now?

519
00:22:28,467 --> 00:22:30,834
Well, see, if you go,
then it's gonna make--

520
00:22:30,834 --> 00:22:33,734
then it makes me look terrible
that I'm not there.

521
00:22:33,734 --> 00:22:35,433
All right,
you're not going, right?

522
00:22:35,433 --> 00:22:37,333
All right, okay.
All right.

523
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:38,967
I mean, if somebody
in my family died,

524
00:22:38,967 --> 00:22:40,367
would I want
a bunch of people I know

525
00:22:40,367 --> 00:22:42,266
to waste their time
coming to my house,

526
00:22:42,266 --> 00:22:45,333
sitting around, eating M&M's
for three hours?

527
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:46,633
What's the point?

528
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,367
Seems like a pretty good
audience in there.

529
00:22:54,367 --> 00:22:55,800
- Yeah.

530
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,734
Well, good.
You're gonna be great.

531
00:22:57,734 --> 00:23:02,200
Um... I wrote that guy
a letter today.

532
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,567
Remember that guy Weingrad?

533
00:23:03,567 --> 00:23:05,400
Weingrad, the guy
from Warner Bros.?

534
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,900
- Oh, okay.
- I had the fight with
on the phone?

535
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,066
You apologizing to him?

536
00:23:08,066 --> 00:23:09,800
- Yeah.

537
00:23:11,133 --> 00:23:13,400
"Dear Mr. Weingrad,
I called you last week

538
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,266
to try and put in
a good word for Jeff Yerkes,

539
00:23:15,266 --> 00:23:17,133
a bright, industrious,
and talented young man

540
00:23:17,133 --> 00:23:19,133
who would be a great asset
to your company.

541
00:23:19,133 --> 00:23:21,233
I hope that
any contentiousness
that arose between us

542
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:24,033
would not jeopardize
any chance he might
have had of being hired.

543
00:23:24,033 --> 00:23:26,200
I'm sorry if I caused you
any distress,

544
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,433
though it obviously
wasn't all my fault,

545
00:23:28,433 --> 00:23:30,133
and I would hope that
if there is ever any need

546
00:23:30,133 --> 00:23:33,233
for us to communicate again,
it will be in better humor."

547
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,934
Wasn't all your fault,
it was--

548
00:23:37,934 --> 00:23:39,900
Well, it wasn't.
Obviously, it wasn't
all my fault.

549
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,633
I'm not gonna say
it's all my fault.

550
00:23:41,633 --> 00:23:43,967
He's gotta take
some responsibility
for it.

551
00:23:43,967 --> 00:23:45,400
I'd rewrite that
if I were you.

552
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,500
- I would rewrite it.

553
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,934
- Hey, Al.

554
00:23:48,934 --> 00:23:50,266
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

555
00:23:50,266 --> 00:23:52,200
- Good, good.

556
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,133
I saw your old house
today in the Valley.

557
00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:57,000
- You're kidding.
- No, I've been looking
at houses in the Valley,

558
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,266
this realtor showed me
your old house.

559
00:23:58,266 --> 00:23:59,800
She goes, "Yeah, Larry David
used to live here."

560
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,100
- "I know Larry."

561
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,433
We like the house,
and we're seriously thinking
of putting a bid on it.

562
00:24:04,433 --> 00:24:06,533
- Get outta here!
- It's a great house, man.

563
00:24:06,533 --> 00:24:09,266
- How long has it been
on the market?

564
00:24:09,266 --> 00:24:11,633
I've been trying--
you know, it's been
on the market for about a year.

565
00:24:11,633 --> 00:24:14,967
Al: I'm excited.
We've looked at about 20,
30 houses in the Valley.

566
00:24:14,967 --> 00:24:16,900
- You know, we're--
- Why do you wanna move
to the Valley?

567
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:20,700
Well, we need
a little more room,
and, you know--

568
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,000
Man:
Larry, Larry, you're up.

569
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,567
Al:
I know it gets
hot there, but, uh...

570
00:24:24,667 --> 00:24:27,834
- Hey, good luck, man.
- Thanks.

571
00:24:27,834 --> 00:24:30,867
- It must have been
very, very stressful

572
00:24:30,867 --> 00:24:32,200
to have grown up
living next door

573
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,000
to Jonas Salk's mother,
I would imagine.

574
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,266
- You know, you got
this woman,

575
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:39,300
and, you know, every day,
the same thing.

576
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:44,200
"Estelle, did I--
did I happen to mention, uh...

577
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,533
that my son Jonas, uh...

578
00:24:47,533 --> 00:24:50,100
who your little Stevie
never let play in the games

579
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,567
or stuck him in right field,
and who never went out

580
00:24:52,567 --> 00:24:54,500
with the girls
and wasn't athletic,

581
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,233
did I happen to mention...

582
00:24:58,533 --> 00:25:01,166
that he discovered
the cure for polio?

583
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:04,367
My little Jonas!

584
00:25:04,367 --> 00:25:06,834
Polio. He's mine!
I love him!

585
00:25:06,834 --> 00:25:08,633
My Jonas!"

586
00:25:12,266 --> 00:25:14,400
Larry:
I've been trying to sell
that house for two years.

587
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,767
You're lucky I didn't
tell my wife.

588
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,834
All right,
let's get started.

589
00:25:20,834 --> 00:25:24,467
Um, Julie has been
scouting some venues,

590
00:25:24,467 --> 00:25:26,900
- and I think we found one
you're gonna be happy with.
- Man: Oh, this place is good.

591
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,734
Looked at a bunch of venues,
and I think the best one for you

592
00:25:29,734 --> 00:25:32,200
is gonna be
the Pasadena Civic Auditorium.

593
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,800
Are you familiar
with this venue?

594
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,800
- No.
- It's beautiful.
It is a great, great house.

595
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,200
Holds about
3,000 seats.

596
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,800
It's warm, it's elegant,
it's exactly, I think,
what we're looking for.

597
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:48,300
- Yeah, but it's very--
yeah, it's a warm feeling.

598
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,700
- Judy: It's intimate,
believe it or not.
- Julie: It really is.

599
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,667
It's really not
as big as it looks.

600
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,166
- This is huge.
- That's not that big.

601
00:25:56,166 --> 00:25:58,033
Look at the size of this.
- It's not that big.

602
00:25:58,033 --> 00:26:00,367
Julie: It's okay.
It's available when
we need it, ample parking.

603
00:26:00,367 --> 00:26:01,633
How are you gonna
fill up this place?

604
00:26:01,633 --> 00:26:04,166
Any audience seats
that are not filled,

605
00:26:04,166 --> 00:26:07,166
it's very simple--
we pay for the house,
we bring in groups--

606
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:08,834
What does that mean,
pay for the house?

607
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:12,567
You bring in groups
of people like the Marines
and convalescent homes.

608
00:26:12,567 --> 00:26:14,767
- Jeff: No, no, no.

609
00:26:14,767 --> 00:26:16,800
Julie:
They're paid.
They're a paid audience.

610
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,667
- Julie: It's $10 a head.

611
00:26:18,667 --> 00:26:21,500
- Larry:
You pay them to laugh?
- Yeah, yeah.

612
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,233
- So, in other words,
the show's fixed?
- Julie: It's not fixed.

613
00:26:24,233 --> 00:26:26,900
We did this
with Eddie Griffin,
and it was very successful.

614
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:29,367
I mean,
the only thing I recommend
is you don't use seniors.

615
00:26:29,367 --> 00:26:32,467
No offense to seniors,
but they tend to talk
out loud during--

616
00:26:32,467 --> 00:26:34,867
Judy: Yeah, they can't--
sometimes they'll ask you to--
"What did he say?"

617
00:26:34,867 --> 00:26:37,266
Man:
It's all innocent,
but it's very distracting.

618
00:26:37,266 --> 00:26:41,300
- Judy: Um, well...
- Yeah, let's take a look
at the models, huh?

619
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:44,200
- Judy: Sure.
- Uh, yeah, well,
I don't know if you overheard,

620
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,400
but, um, I just had
this idea--

621
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,734
Jeff:
Who are you?
What are you doing?

622
00:26:47,734 --> 00:26:49,600
My name's Suzy,
and I'm the production designer.

623
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,767
Jeff:
Right, Suzy.
I'm sorry. I apologize.

624
00:26:51,767 --> 00:26:53,300
I just wanna
show you the model.

625
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:56,000
It's something
I'm really, really
excited about.

626
00:26:57,333 --> 00:26:59,767
Take a look at this.
This should look familiar.

627
00:27:02,667 --> 00:27:05,400
It'll open up
on the "Seinfeld" set.

628
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,834
As you can see, this--

629
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:09,200
the stage rotates,
and--

630
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,500
so it'll open up
on the "Seinfeld" set,

631
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,233
and then it'll rotate
to reveal...

632
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:19,867
Larry, the man
behind the scenes.

633
00:27:19,867 --> 00:27:21,700
The man behind "Seinfeld."

634
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:25,066
- Man: That's great.

635
00:27:25,066 --> 00:27:27,300
- Man: Seeing that revolve,
too, is great.
- Suzy: Yeah.

636
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,934
- Judy: Yeah.
- Suzy: There you go.
The man behind "Seinfeld."

637
00:27:29,934 --> 00:27:33,066
- Judy: And we can add a craft
service table if you want.
 Isn't that fun?

638
00:27:33,066 --> 00:27:35,467
Judy:
Clever.
Really excited about it.

639
00:27:35,467 --> 00:27:38,934
Well... I know you put
a lot of work into this.

640
00:27:38,934 --> 00:27:40,200
Yeah. Yeah.

641
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,333
And, uh, the idea,
the concept, is, uh--

642
00:27:44,333 --> 00:27:46,433
- is very clever.
- Thank you.

643
00:27:46,433 --> 00:27:48,066
And it looks good
and all that,

644
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:52,133
but, um, I just don't
think it's right.

645
00:27:52,133 --> 00:27:54,033
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, wow.

646
00:27:54,033 --> 00:27:55,200
- Larry: There's no way.
It's impossible.

647
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,533
Larry:
Yeah.

648
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,133
- Okay.
- Man: Excuse me.

649
00:27:59,133 --> 00:28:03,400
We've already
designed a whole program
around that idea.

650
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,867
No, it's okay.
I mean, we wanna make this...

651
00:28:05,867 --> 00:28:07,266
We wanna make
Larry happy and--

652
00:28:07,266 --> 00:28:09,800
Well, I did-- I did
bring another one,

653
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,900
because I know
you kind of want
something really simple.

654
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,834
- This is really simple and...

655
00:28:16,834 --> 00:28:18,200
There you go.

656
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,700
- Man: Oh, that's a good one.
 Fun.

657
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,133
Just a simple curtain.

658
00:28:23,133 --> 00:28:25,300
- Plain.

659
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,667
- Suzy: That's Larry.
- Jeff: Oh, okay.

660
00:28:27,667 --> 00:28:30,367
Suzy:
You know, if you could
picture yourself right here...

661
00:28:30,367 --> 00:28:31,767
If you have
a Smith & Wesson on you,

662
00:28:31,767 --> 00:28:33,467
just put it to my head
and pull the trigger.

663
00:28:34,934 --> 00:28:37,367
'Cause if that--
'cause if I look
anything like that,

664
00:28:37,367 --> 00:28:39,667
I really don't
wanna be living
on the planet anymore.

665
00:28:39,667 --> 00:28:41,333
- Man: It's just fun.

666
00:28:41,333 --> 00:28:44,834
This actually comes--
this actually comes off.

667
00:28:44,834 --> 00:28:46,900
Yeah, okay.
That's okay.

668
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,033
- That's fine.

669
00:28:48,033 --> 00:28:49,767
- Yeah.
- Okay.

670
00:28:49,767 --> 00:28:52,066
- Man: That's nice.
- You know, there's
not a lot to this.

671
00:28:52,066 --> 00:28:53,233
Larry:
Yeah, well...

672
00:28:53,233 --> 00:28:55,300
Suzy:
This makes my job
real easy.

673
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,266
Man:
No, we'll go
with that, then, huh?

674
00:28:59,266 --> 00:29:00,900
Great.
- Larry: Yeah.

675
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,133
- Man: That's nice.
- Larry: Very good.

676
00:29:02,133 --> 00:29:03,600
- Judy: Perfect. Great.
- Larry: Very good.

677
00:29:07,767 --> 00:29:10,633
Interviewer:
Are you concerned
about how well

678
00:29:10,633 --> 00:29:15,033
this situation with HBO
is going to go?

679
00:29:15,033 --> 00:29:17,667
I'm not really
too concerned about HBO.

680
00:29:17,667 --> 00:29:20,500
- I am concerned about
that auditorium, though.
- Yeah.

681
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,333
Larry:
Well, it's clear
I wouldn't have done this

682
00:29:22,333 --> 00:29:24,300
without Jeff
pushing me to do it.

683
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,734
Sometimes I curse him
on my way home

684
00:29:26,734 --> 00:29:29,467
or something
that I'm actually doing it.

685
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:32,600
And, you know, my wife,
to tell you the truth,

686
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,567
really can't stand him.

687
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:37,266
She wants me
to leave him.

688
00:29:37,266 --> 00:29:40,934
Of course, I'm sure
he wants me to leave her.

689
00:29:40,934 --> 00:29:43,166
The one thing about Hitler
that I admire

690
00:29:43,166 --> 00:29:45,734
is that he wouldn't take
any shit from magicians,
you know?

691
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:57,400
Hitler was a big, big fan
of magic, and...

692
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:02,400
Hitler would go to a--
he'd go to a magic club,

693
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,800
and he'd watch
the show, and...

694
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,967
afterwards,
he'd go backstage

695
00:30:06,967 --> 00:30:08,633
and talk to the magician.

696
00:30:08,633 --> 00:30:09,867
He'd go...

697
00:30:09,867 --> 00:30:12,367
"That was a wonderful show,

698
00:30:12,367 --> 00:30:14,834
and I was just wondering--
I was talking to my friend.

699
00:30:14,834 --> 00:30:16,700
Where's the rabbit?"

700
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,734
"I'm sorry, mein Führer,  uh...

701
00:30:22,734 --> 00:30:24,200
I'm really glad
you enjoyed it,

702
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,567
but we're really not allowed
to tell about the secrets.

703
00:30:27,567 --> 00:30:29,600
You know, they're tricks.
We're not allowed."

704
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,867
"Yes, yes, I understand
you're not allowed to tell,

705
00:30:31,867 --> 00:30:33,500
but just tell me,
where's the rabbit?"

706
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,433
"Mein Führer,  really,
it's a union thing.

707
00:30:37,433 --> 00:30:41,133
We just--"
"Where is the rabbit?!

708
00:30:41,133 --> 00:30:44,133
You will tell me
where the rabbit is now!"

709
00:30:49,333 --> 00:30:50,734
- Woman: 65¢.

710
00:30:50,734 --> 00:30:53,300
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

711
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,100
Interviewer:
So, these clubs that
you're playing in New York,

712
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,734
are these the clubs
that you played 10 years ago?

713
00:30:57,734 --> 00:31:00,500
Yeah, one club--
one club is like...

714
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,233
- Hey, Mark.
- Hey, Larry.

715
00:31:04,233 --> 00:31:05,700
Hey.
How you doing?

716
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,333
I'm so sorry to hear
about your stepfather.

717
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:09,967
Yeah, thanks.
I just got back
from Detroit.

718
00:31:09,967 --> 00:31:11,834
Oh, no kidding.
Wow.

719
00:31:11,834 --> 00:31:14,834
I'm so sorry,
'cause I wanted to go
to the wake that night,

720
00:31:14,834 --> 00:31:16,300
and I had to go
to my daughter's school.

721
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,033
They had, like,
this pizza night
or something,

722
00:31:18,033 --> 00:31:19,567
and the kids
came in pajamas,

723
00:31:19,567 --> 00:31:22,600
and I told my wife
that, you know, I wanted
to go to the wake, and...

724
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,633
( indistinct announcement
over P.A. )

725
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:26,200
You know, uh...

726
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,066
Well, I'm happy to hear
that at least you were
thinking about it.

727
00:31:29,066 --> 00:31:32,133
Everything okay?
The funeral was all right?

728
00:31:32,133 --> 00:31:33,567
You know,
it is what it is.

729
00:31:33,567 --> 00:31:36,233
It's death, you know?
It's part of life, right?

730
00:31:38,133 --> 00:31:40,600
Yeah.
It is, I guess.

731
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,266
We're lucky
to be alive.

732
00:31:43,367 --> 00:31:46,000
Yeah.
Yeah, we are.

733
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,767
Yeah, you gotta,
you know...

734
00:31:50,667 --> 00:31:54,033
Um, well, shit,
can I call you next week?

735
00:31:54,033 --> 00:31:56,934
Because I gotta--
I gotta catch a plane here.

736
00:31:56,934 --> 00:31:59,233
Sure, Larry,
give me a call.

737
00:31:59,233 --> 00:32:00,734
That's fine.

738
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,266
Did you get the flowers?

739
00:32:04,266 --> 00:32:06,433
- No.
 You didn't
get the flowers?

740
00:32:06,433 --> 00:32:08,200
No, I didn't get
anything, Larry.

741
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,400
- I sent-- I sent flowers.
- Didn't get a phone call,
a card, or flowers.

742
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,934
My wife was supposed
to send the flowers.

743
00:32:11,934 --> 00:32:13,667
I told her to send flowers.
You didn't get them?

744
00:32:13,667 --> 00:32:16,066
- Well, she didn't do it.
- Oh, I am so pissed off at her.

745
00:32:16,066 --> 00:32:19,300
- My wife--
- I was pretty pissed about
that, too, Larry, you know?

746
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:22,533
I mean, the least
you could have done is,
like, called me or something.

747
00:32:22,533 --> 00:32:24,533
You know, I thought
we were friends.

748
00:32:24,533 --> 00:32:25,800
I can't believe that.

749
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,033
- Ed came.

750
00:32:28,033 --> 00:32:30,166
- Yeah.

751
00:32:30,166 --> 00:32:32,033
He was here.
He brought flowers himself.

752
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:33,767
He delivered them himself.

753
00:32:38,934 --> 00:32:40,900
I mean,
it's just a courtesy.

754
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,934
You could have
at least called, Larry.

755
00:32:42,934 --> 00:32:45,200
Want a piece of gum?

756
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,533
No, Larry, I don't
want a piece of gum.

757
00:32:49,266 --> 00:32:51,033
What do you think
this costs?

758
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,100
If you wanted to do
a science experiment

759
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:03,367
that people are what they are
despite their environment,

760
00:33:03,367 --> 00:33:04,967
this is the guy.

761
00:33:04,967 --> 00:33:07,166
Everything
in his environment

762
00:33:07,166 --> 00:33:09,667
and his context of his life
has been changed.

763
00:33:09,667 --> 00:33:11,367
Everything.

764
00:33:11,367 --> 00:33:14,233
And he is absolutely
the same.

765
00:33:14,233 --> 00:33:16,467
This guy proves
you are what you are.

766
00:33:16,467 --> 00:33:19,066
- Here you go. Thank you.
- Oh, thank you so much.
That's very nice of you.

767
00:33:19,066 --> 00:33:20,567
- Thank you.
- Mr. David, hi.

768
00:33:20,567 --> 00:33:22,233
Patrick O'Hara.
I'm HBO Media Relations.

769
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:24,033
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Hey, we talked!

770
00:33:26,133 --> 00:33:27,934
How was the flight?

771
00:33:27,934 --> 00:33:29,567
- Pretty good.
- Good.

772
00:33:29,567 --> 00:33:31,767
Couple of celebrities
on board.

773
00:33:31,767 --> 00:33:36,166
- Um, Ellen Barkin.

774
00:33:36,166 --> 00:33:37,633
- Jeff: Yeah.

775
00:33:37,633 --> 00:33:40,000
Great, great body.

776
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,467
- She's hot, yeah.
- Yeah, she's hot.

777
00:33:41,467 --> 00:33:43,567
And who is-- what's her name
from "Saturday Night Live"?

778
00:33:43,567 --> 00:33:45,200
- Oh, Molly Shannon.
- Yeah.

779
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,367
Oh, did she fuck
any stewards to death?

780
00:33:50,233 --> 00:33:52,000
Oh, God...

781
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,367
- I said did she--
did she fuck anybody

782
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:58,066
and kill them on the plane
in first class?

783
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,934
What are you talking about?

784
00:34:00,934 --> 00:34:03,133
- Come on, it's a Molly Shannon
thing.

785
00:34:03,133 --> 00:34:04,934
What Molly Shannon
thing?

786
00:34:04,934 --> 00:34:07,467
Come on.

787
00:34:07,467 --> 00:34:10,734
You don't know this?
Great. Okay.

788
00:34:10,734 --> 00:34:13,033
Molly Shannon fucked
two guys to death.

789
00:34:13,033 --> 00:34:14,400
She was engaged
to both of them--

790
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,567
I'm serious.
She fucked two guys to death.

791
00:34:16,567 --> 00:34:20,333
One was this guy,
like this 50-year-old guy,

792
00:34:20,333 --> 00:34:24,567
first year on "SNL,"
some, like, business manager
that she was engaged to.

793
00:34:24,567 --> 00:34:27,934
They had sex,
he-- his heart,
like, exploded.

794
00:34:27,934 --> 00:34:29,834
She fucked him to death,
and she just got over it

795
00:34:29,834 --> 00:34:31,400
and she was going out
with one of the sound guys.

796
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,734
I mean, he got--
they fucked,

797
00:34:34,734 --> 00:34:37,033
and he died, too.

798
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:40,300
- I'm-- I am-- I couldn't
be more serious.

799
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,467
Larry: First of all,
I know Molly Shannon,
and I never heard this.

800
00:34:42,467 --> 00:34:44,233
I love Molly Shannon.
I'm just saying--

801
00:34:44,233 --> 00:34:45,800
My wife is really
a good friend of hers,

802
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,633
so I don't know
where you get that from.

803
00:34:47,633 --> 00:34:49,200
- I think she's
the best thing on the show.

804
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,967
I know this
because my lover, Paul,

805
00:34:50,967 --> 00:34:53,367
is friends with Brian,
who's the costumer over
at "SNL."

806
00:34:53,367 --> 00:34:55,066
You know what they say
about Irish Catholic girls.

807
00:34:55,066 --> 00:34:56,767
- I would know.
'Cause I am one.
- Larry: Okay.

808
00:34:56,767 --> 00:34:58,533
Patrick, Patrick.

809
00:34:58,533 --> 00:35:00,633
Pardon me, you shouldn't--
you shouldn't really,
you know.

810
00:35:00,633 --> 00:35:03,867
I mean, there's a driver here
and you shouldn't even be
talking about that to anyone.

811
00:35:03,867 --> 00:35:06,900
That's a crazy thing
to talk about.

812
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,233
Okay.

813
00:35:12,333 --> 00:35:13,934
Larry:
The closest
I ever came to death

814
00:35:13,934 --> 00:35:16,200
was when I masturbated
with a 104-degree temperature.

815
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:21,400
I was-- I had the flu
and I was sweating.

816
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,600
I was under the covers,
I was shivering.

817
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,467
And the sweat
was coming down

818
00:35:26,467 --> 00:35:29,300
and I couldn't even
raise my arm, hardly.

819
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:33,100
And all of a sudden,
it started, like,
to drip down.

820
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,567
And I'm dying here.

821
00:35:34,567 --> 00:35:36,600
And the next thing I know,
boom-boom-boom.

822
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,800
You know, and then,
oh, my God.

823
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,033
I thought I was dead.
I saw the white light.

824
00:35:42,033 --> 00:35:43,967
I started drifting toward
the white light.

825
00:35:43,967 --> 00:35:45,367
And then
there's my uncle going,

826
00:35:45,367 --> 00:35:47,767
"Oh, my God,
you disgusting animal!

827
00:35:47,767 --> 00:35:51,166
- What the hell's
the matter with you?"

828
00:35:51,166 --> 00:35:54,500
- I thought the posse thing
worked very well tonight.
- Oh, it was great.

829
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,467
- I loved that.
- That worked, and...

830
00:35:56,467 --> 00:35:58,300
Hi, honey.

831
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:01,000
Oh, hey, hey, hey.

832
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,200
I-- I was supposed to--
upstairs.

833
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,834
- I'm sorry.
- I know.
I was waiting for you.

834
00:36:04,834 --> 00:36:06,300
I know, I was supposed
to come up there.

835
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,033
I-- oh!
I-- I know.

836
00:36:08,033 --> 00:36:10,333
Look, it's Becky.
Becky, it's Larry.

837
00:36:10,333 --> 00:36:11,700
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

838
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,633
- Heard a lot about you.

839
00:36:13,633 --> 00:36:15,934
- Yeah, so...
- I'm so glad to see you.

840
00:36:15,934 --> 00:36:17,800
Yeah, I know.
It's nice, nice.

841
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,100
You wanna--
- I don't know.

842
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,633
You wanna go
get something to eat?

843
00:36:21,633 --> 00:36:25,367
- That sounds like fun.

844
00:36:25,367 --> 00:36:26,900
All right, so, um,

845
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,867
you feeling good about
what went on upstairs?

846
00:36:28,867 --> 00:36:30,000
Feel pretty good
about it?

847
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,600
Yeah, not bad.

848
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,367
Good.
That's good.

849
00:36:33,367 --> 00:36:34,600
- Let's go.
- All right, good.

850
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,066
- So--

851
00:36:36,066 --> 00:36:37,800
That's okay, thank you.
I'm good.

852
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,266
I'm gonna go back to the hotel,
but thanks anyway.

853
00:36:40,266 --> 00:36:42,600
I'll talk to you--
till later.

854
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,066
- Yeah, good.
- Good.

855
00:36:44,066 --> 00:36:46,033
- Okay. Nice to meet you.
- Nice meeting you.

856
00:36:49,967 --> 00:36:52,433
Cheryl:
You're not gonna go out
with Jeff tonight?

857
00:36:52,433 --> 00:36:53,667
Go out with Jeff?
What are you, crazy?

858
00:36:53,667 --> 00:36:54,900
It's 1:00
in the morning.

859
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,734
- I don't know, I just...

860
00:36:56,734 --> 00:36:59,467
I'm tired.
I just got back.
I'm gonna go to sleep.

861
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,633
All right, just curious.

862
00:37:01,633 --> 00:37:03,767
- Yeah.
- See what you guys
are doing out there.

863
00:37:03,767 --> 00:37:05,867
Doing? Believe me,
we're not doing anything.

864
00:37:05,867 --> 00:37:08,800
- We're not doing a thing.
 Okay.

865
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,700
There's nothing
that we're doing
except working.

866
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,633
- Okay!
- I'll talk to you
tomorrow.

867
00:37:13,633 --> 00:37:15,633
- Okay. Bye.
- Okay. Bye.

868
00:37:30,934 --> 00:37:32,934
Why didn't you tell me
you were bringing her
to breakfast?

869
00:37:32,934 --> 00:37:35,800
- I wouldn't have come.
- You wouldn't have come
if you knew she was coming?

870
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,700
No, why would I want to have
breakfast with the two of you?

871
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,867
- Well, we talked.
- I know. It's not that.

872
00:37:39,867 --> 00:37:42,500
But I could have done
something else, you know.

873
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,800
Eh, you know.

874
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,734
Your wife doesn't know
anything about this?

875
00:37:46,734 --> 00:37:48,633
I'll-- I'll tell you
more later.

876
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:49,934
- I don't wanna, you know.
- Hey, guys.

877
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:52,867
Hey! Hey, hey,
hey, hey.

878
00:37:52,867 --> 00:37:55,300
So I gotta go to MTV.
What are you doing?

879
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:58,200
Um, I don't know,
I think I'll just...

880
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,033
maybe take a walk
in the park.

881
00:38:00,033 --> 00:38:01,633
Through the East Side?

882
00:38:01,633 --> 00:38:03,400
- Huh.
- That's where
my tie shop is.

883
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,467
Why don't you go
walking with him
and pick up the ties.

884
00:38:06,467 --> 00:38:08,900
- Okay.


Go for a nice walk.

885
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:11,066
And I'll meet you later.
I'll see you back
at the hotel.

886
00:38:11,066 --> 00:38:12,900
Okay, bye.

887
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,066
Bye.
I'll see you later.

888
00:38:15,967 --> 00:38:17,300
What are you--
what are you doing?

889
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:21,100
I'm walking over
to the East Side
to pick up his ties.

890
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:24,166
- Um, okay.
- Let's go.

891
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,367
It's a really
nice day out.

892
00:38:32,667 --> 00:38:36,333
- Mmm, not really.

893
00:38:36,333 --> 00:38:39,166
- Oh. It's great.

894
00:38:39,166 --> 00:38:41,133
Yeah, this is
a great park
to do it in.

895
00:38:41,133 --> 00:38:43,567
Yeah, I guess.
I don't know.

896
00:38:43,567 --> 00:38:46,300
That's awfully thin,
isn't it, those wheels?

897
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,800
- It's good exercise.
 Yeah?

898
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:51,000
Larry? Hi.
It's Cindy DeCoste.

899
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,300
- Oh, hey.

900
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,900
- God, good to see you.

901
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,300
Nice to see you.

902
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:58,200
It is so funny.
I was just thinking
of Cheryl this morning.

903
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,066
I was going through
my jewelry box and saw some--

904
00:39:01,066 --> 00:39:03,300
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Oh, this is a--
a friend of mine, Becky.

905
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:06,166
- Hi, I'm Becky.
- Hi, Cin-- uh, Cindy.
How you doing?

906
00:39:06,166 --> 00:39:07,834
Actually, a friend
of a friend.

907
00:39:07,834 --> 00:39:09,033
Oh.

908
00:39:09,033 --> 00:39:10,934
So we just had
a cup of coffee before

909
00:39:10,934 --> 00:39:11,900
with her friend.

910
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,333
Becky:
Coffee's good.
You know, whatever.

911
00:39:16,333 --> 00:39:17,400
No, I mean
with her friend.

912
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,500
We had coffee
with her friend,

913
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,633
and then her friend,
like, left and...

914
00:39:20,633 --> 00:39:21,934
- All right.
-  Yeah.

915
00:39:21,934 --> 00:39:23,467
So, let's, you know.

916
00:39:23,467 --> 00:39:25,266
You-- okay.

917
00:39:25,266 --> 00:39:27,667
- He's great.

918
00:39:27,667 --> 00:39:29,367
- Yeah, he's doing great.

919
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:30,934
So, we're doing
really good together.

920
00:39:30,934 --> 00:39:32,934
Good.
Oh, good, good.

921
00:39:32,934 --> 00:39:34,633
All right, well,
so, um...

922
00:39:34,633 --> 00:39:36,100
Yeah, tell Cheryl
I said hi.

923
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,333
I will, I'll tell her
you said hi.

924
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:38,700
Great, I'll--
okay, great.

925
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,133
- Take care.
- All right.

926
00:39:40,133 --> 00:39:42,000
- See you later.
- It's good that you're jogging.

927
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,200
- That's great.
 Okay.

928
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,033
Let's go--
let's go this way.

929
00:39:47,033 --> 00:39:48,600
She seemed nice.

930
00:39:52,266 --> 00:39:53,400
Who's Cheryl?

931
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,467
- My-- my wife.
- Oh, oh.

932
00:39:56,467 --> 00:39:58,800
Larry:
This is actually a great time
for me to cheat on my wife

933
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,367
because of that
whole Clinton scandal.

934
00:40:00,367 --> 00:40:02,800
You know, 'cause she was
such a staunch supporter
of the guy

935
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,433
that, you know,
what is she gonna say?

936
00:40:09,467 --> 00:40:12,000
I can do whatever I want.
Come on.

937
00:40:13,667 --> 00:40:15,633
Did Clinton actually think
that he was gonna get blowjobs

938
00:40:15,633 --> 00:40:18,166
from a Jew
and get off scot

939
00:40:20,333 --> 00:40:21,967
What was he gonna do?

940
00:40:21,967 --> 00:40:24,133
The guy never-- obviously
was never with a Jew before.

941
00:40:24,133 --> 00:40:26,000
He thinks he's gonna
get blowjobs--

942
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,667
blowjobs
from a Jewish woman

943
00:40:29,667 --> 00:40:30,834
and that's gonna be
the end of it?

944
00:40:30,834 --> 00:40:32,700
No consequences?

945
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,567
What is he, crazy?

946
00:40:37,633 --> 00:40:38,834
Yeah, let me ask you
a question--

947
00:40:38,834 --> 00:40:40,133
who do you think
has more freedom?

948
00:40:40,133 --> 00:40:41,834
The married man
in America

949
00:40:41,834 --> 00:40:44,033
or the single man
in Communist China?

950
00:40:46,467 --> 00:40:49,266
I gotta go for the single guy
in Communist China.

951
00:40:49,266 --> 00:40:50,467
Come on,
there's no contest.

952
00:40:50,467 --> 00:40:52,934
You know.

953
00:40:52,934 --> 00:40:54,800
I mean, I'm a married guy
in America.

954
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,300
I can leave the country,
but I can't leave my house.

955
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,433
You know.

956
00:40:59,433 --> 00:41:01,300
They can leave the house,
but they can't leave
the country.

957
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,700
I'll go for that.
I like that better.

958
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,800
I'm not going to Europe.
Where the hell am I going?

959
00:41:06,066 --> 00:41:08,133
Hey, are you there?

960
00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:10,300
Pick up if you're there.

961
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:13,633
Hello?
No

962
00:41:13,633 --> 00:41:15,300
How come you're not home?

963
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:18,000
All right, you didn't talk
to your friend Cindy today,
did you?

964
00:41:19,467 --> 00:41:22,433
You know... you know
she's got a big mouth, right?

965
00:41:22,433 --> 00:41:25,533
And if she said anything
to you, which she probably
shouldn't have said,

966
00:41:25,533 --> 00:41:27,300
I hope
you didn't believe it.

967
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:30,233
Because if she said
anything to you, I mean,
she's out of her mind.

968
00:41:30,233 --> 00:41:33,433
I can't even imagine
what she could have said, but...

969
00:41:33,433 --> 00:41:35,767
you know, come on,
it's-- it's crazy.

970
00:41:35,767 --> 00:41:39,200
You did tell her
to shut up, right?

971
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,567
To mind her own business?

972
00:41:40,567 --> 00:41:44,200
That I would never, ever
do anything like that?

973
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:47,033
I mean, come on,
she's 25 years old.

974
00:41:47,033 --> 00:41:50,533
So-- so don't be--
don't be pissed off.

975
00:41:50,533 --> 00:41:52,667
Nothing happened.
You know that.

976
00:41:52,667 --> 00:41:54,000
All right?

977
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,567
I love you.
Ahem.

978
00:41:55,567 --> 00:41:57,433
I love you and my voice
went up on that,

979
00:41:57,433 --> 00:42:01,133
but, you know, that--
that doesn't mean anything.

980
00:42:01,133 --> 00:42:03,433
It was just because I have
a little bit of a sore throat.

981
00:42:03,433 --> 00:42:05,133
So, you know
that I love you.

982
00:42:05,133 --> 00:42:06,900
My voice shouldn't have
gone up on that.

983
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,567
It was just
a terrible coincidence.

984
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:11,166
Larry:
Yeah, checking out.
David, Larry David.

985
00:42:11,166 --> 00:42:12,800
And the room number?

986
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,800
Um, 5201.

987
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,500
Just a final signature, please.
Only for your incidentals.

988
00:42:20,367 --> 00:42:22,166
$276?

989
00:42:22,166 --> 00:42:24,233
- Yes.
- I made, like,
five phone calls or something.

990
00:42:24,233 --> 00:42:25,567
Well, it's actually
phone calls

991
00:42:25,567 --> 00:42:27,734
and it shows
a number of movies
right here.

992
00:42:27,734 --> 00:42:29,500
- You can take a look.

993
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,934
Oh, okay, fine.
What are you doing?
Give it to me.

994
00:42:31,934 --> 00:42:34,367
No! No, no, no, no!
HBO pays for the porn.

995
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:35,934
- Could you-- could you--
- HBO pays for porn.

996
00:42:35,934 --> 00:42:37,500
- Shut up, shut up.
- Patrick, come here.

997
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,400
- No.
- HBO should pay
for the porn.

998
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,934
The porn?

999
00:42:40,934 --> 00:42:43,533
Actually, it shows that
it's only room and tax
plus the meals.

1000
00:42:43,533 --> 00:42:44,600
Right...

1001
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,233
Well, we handle
the room and tax,

1002
00:42:46,233 --> 00:42:47,567
but I can make a call
about the porn.

1003
00:42:47,567 --> 00:42:49,500
- I-- don't call anybody.
- Call about the porn.

1004
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,967
I'm paying for it.

1005
00:42:50,967 --> 00:42:53,667
No, stop it.
Stop wasting!
Why do you waste?

1006
00:42:53,667 --> 00:42:56,000
- I'll pay for it.
- No, you need when you need
to relax, okay?

1007
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,333
- Shut up. No.
- HBO is paying for the porn.

1008
00:42:59,333 --> 00:43:01,200
- They're set up
only for room and tax.

1009
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,567
- Only for room and tax.

1010
00:43:02,567 --> 00:43:04,700
- Losmir.
- Jeff: Losmir,
just charge it for now.

1011
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:06,233
Please call someone
about the porn.

1012
00:43:06,233 --> 00:43:08,266
- Please.
- I can make a call
right now about the porn.

1013
00:43:08,266 --> 00:43:12,033
- HBO will cover the porn.
- Larry: I don't care.
I don't care.

1014
00:43:12,033 --> 00:43:13,400
Why do you waste?

1015
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:15,934
Crazy.

1016
00:43:15,934 --> 00:43:18,033
Losmir:
So, Mr. David, I'll need
your signature, please.

1017
00:43:20,033 --> 00:43:22,667
- Jeff: If I were--
- Shut up!

1018
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,033
So you would like
to settle everything?

1019
00:43:26,033 --> 00:43:27,500
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1020
00:43:29,533 --> 00:43:30,600
- Yeah, okay.
- Thank you.

1021
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:33,133
And I'll give you
a final copy.

1022
00:43:33,133 --> 00:43:36,200
- Sorry about the--
- It's fine.
Don't worry about it.

1023
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,467
- Here you go.
And here's your receipt.
- Thanks.

1024
00:43:38,467 --> 00:43:40,166
- Okay, that's fine.
I don't-- I don't want it.
- Okay.

1025
00:43:40,166 --> 00:43:42,333
Want me to make a call?
I can make a call.

1026
00:43:42,333 --> 00:43:43,667
Don't make any calls,
please.

1027
00:43:43,667 --> 00:43:45,667
Do me a favor,
just don't mention this.

1028
00:43:45,667 --> 00:43:47,367
I won't say a thing.

1029
00:43:48,967 --> 00:43:50,867
I think if he had
the opportunity,

1030
00:43:50,867 --> 00:43:53,200
he would kill people
that--

1031
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,700
if he thought
he can get away with it,

1032
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:56,734
I think he would, like,
put contracts out

1033
00:43:56,734 --> 00:43:58,367
on people
that crossed him.

1034
00:44:01,333 --> 00:44:04,100
What the hell
is going on, Larry?

1035
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,800
I was with...

1036
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:10,200
this guy I knew from college
and his girlfriend.

1037
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,834
And when we left
the restaurant--
we were having breakfast.

1038
00:44:12,834 --> 00:44:14,867
When we left
the restaurant,

1039
00:44:14,867 --> 00:44:17,433
I was left with her
'cause he went someplace,

1040
00:44:17,433 --> 00:44:20,300
and I was walking--
I said I was gonna walk
through the park,

1041
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:22,633
and she tagged along
with me.

1042
00:44:22,633 --> 00:44:23,633
Mm-hmm.

1043
00:44:23,633 --> 00:44:25,667
- Mm-hmm.

1044
00:44:25,667 --> 00:44:28,333
And then we ran into Cindy,
who was jogging.

1045
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:30,467
And I thought that Cindy...

1046
00:44:32,133 --> 00:44:34,967
thought that I was doing
something untoward.

1047
00:44:34,967 --> 00:44:36,767
You know?

1048
00:44:36,767 --> 00:44:38,100
Why would she think that?

1049
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:40,266
Because I was with
this blonde woman
in the park.

1050
00:44:40,266 --> 00:44:42,000
- What were
you doing with her?
- Just walking.

1051
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,600
Wait-- wait a second.

1052
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:47,166
-  No, it's-- I'm...

1053
00:44:47,166 --> 00:44:48,867
- That's what happened!
- Okay, but the--

1054
00:44:48,867 --> 00:44:51,033
Well, what do you think?
I wanna walk with this woman?

1055
00:44:51,033 --> 00:44:53,033
She was talking about ginseng
for an hour and a half!

1056
00:44:53,033 --> 00:44:55,000
- I-- I don't wanna
talk to her!
- This is--

1057
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,533
Okay, so what did you say
to Cindy when you ran into her?

1058
00:44:57,533 --> 00:45:02,100
Did you say, "Hi, this is
my college friend's girlfriend"?

1059
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:04,266
No, I said, yeah,
this is somebody--

1060
00:45:04,266 --> 00:45:06,133
I said it was
a friend of a friend.

1061
00:45:06,133 --> 00:45:08,333
What, a friend of a friend?
What-- that's the craziest--

1062
00:45:08,333 --> 00:45:10,367
I was a little thrown.

1063
00:45:16,867 --> 00:45:18,300
But you're not
having an affair?

1064
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:20,133
I swear
on my children's lives

1065
00:45:20,133 --> 00:45:21,600
that I'm not having
an affair, okay?

1066
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,600
Now, isn't that enough?

1067
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:26,500
You swear
on your children's life that

1068
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:29,133
the girl you were with
was your...

1069
00:45:29,133 --> 00:45:30,600
college roommate's
girlfriend?

1070
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:40,433
I swear on my children's lives
that the girl I was with
was not my girlfriend,

1071
00:45:40,433 --> 00:45:42,834
that I just
met her that morning,
had breakfast with her,

1072
00:45:42,834 --> 00:45:44,667
and walked
in the park with her.

1073
00:45:44,667 --> 00:45:49,233
- So she's not
your girlfriend?
- No. No.

1074
00:45:49,233 --> 00:45:50,367
Then, who is she?

1075
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,200
She's just this woman,
you know.

1076
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,300
Is she Jeff's?

1077
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:58,967
No.

1078
00:45:58,967 --> 00:46:00,533
You swear
on your children's life?

1079
00:46:04,266 --> 00:46:07,567
Larry...

1080
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:14,266
Um...

1081
00:46:16,467 --> 00:46:18,400
You know,
this whole business

1082
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,533
about swearing
on my children's lives

1083
00:46:20,533 --> 00:46:22,433
is starting to make me
very uncomfortable.

1084
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,133
Larry:
It's a good thing
they didn't have

1085
00:46:28,133 --> 00:46:32,133
answering machines
when they were trying
to form posses, you know.

1086
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,967
'Cause everybody
would be screening.

1087
00:46:36,967 --> 00:46:38,300
You know what I mean?

1088
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:42,033
"Larry, this is
Sheriff Robbins calling.

1089
00:46:42,033 --> 00:46:44,333
We're getting a, uh"--

1090
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:47,333
"We're getting
a posse together

1091
00:46:47,333 --> 00:46:50,333
this afternoon
around 2:30.

1092
00:46:50,333 --> 00:46:53,700
We're gonna meet
by the old red barn.

1093
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,700
Jeez, we'd sure
appreciate it"--

1094
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:00,133
"We'd sure appreciate it
if you could make
this posse soon.

1095
00:47:00,133 --> 00:47:02,667
We're kind of short on guys,
and, uh...

1096
00:47:02,667 --> 00:47:04,300
we only got about
three or four guys,

1097
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:05,734
and, shit, we can
really use you.

1098
00:47:05,734 --> 00:47:07,433
You know what?

1099
00:47:07,433 --> 00:47:09,567
We're gonna be going
after the Fontinato gang,

1100
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:12,900
and that's some
tough motherfuckers,
boy, and, uh...

1101
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:16,233
we-- you better bring
some warm clothing.

1102
00:47:16,233 --> 00:47:17,934
It's gonna be cold
out there.

1103
00:47:17,934 --> 00:47:21,233
It's colder than shit
out there, and, uh,
we're gonna--

1104
00:47:21,233 --> 00:47:24,033
we're gonna be gone
about, oh, maybe about
six, seven days,

1105
00:47:24,033 --> 00:47:26,600
so, you know,
stock up, and, uh...

1106
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:28,500
the Fontinato--
I gotta tell you once again,

1107
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,633
they're--
they're tough, so...

1108
00:47:30,633 --> 00:47:33,667
I sure hope--
I sure hope you can make it.

1109
00:47:33,667 --> 00:47:35,233
And, uh...

1110
00:47:37,133 --> 00:47:39,400
I hope to see--
I hope to see you out there."

1111
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,767
Then you--
two weeks later,

1112
00:47:44,767 --> 00:47:46,200
you run into the sheriff
in town.

1113
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:49,667
"Sheriff!
Oh, my God!

1114
00:47:49,667 --> 00:47:52,266
What happened?
I just-- I got home at 3:00!

1115
00:47:52,266 --> 00:47:54,400
I just missed
your message!

1116
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,834
How'd the posse go?
Did it go okay?

1117
00:47:56,834 --> 00:47:57,967
What happened?
Did you catch him?

1118
00:47:57,967 --> 00:48:00,500
I-- I never found out.
What happened?

1119
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:03,700
Oh, I was so pissed off!

1120
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:04,934
I tried, I went over
to the red barn.

1121
00:48:04,934 --> 00:48:06,700
Nobody was there.

1122
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:08,066
They told me
you just left.

1123
00:48:08,066 --> 00:48:09,767
Oh, shit."

1124
00:48:11,266 --> 00:48:12,367
I can guarantee you this.

1125
00:48:12,367 --> 00:48:14,533
Now, we haven't filmed
the special yet,

1126
00:48:14,533 --> 00:48:16,500
the concert part of it,

1127
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:17,867
but no matter
how that goes,

1128
00:48:17,867 --> 00:48:19,867
I can guarantee
from his experiences

1129
00:48:19,867 --> 00:48:22,767
of being onstage again,

1130
00:48:22,767 --> 00:48:27,300
that Larry David
will never stop doing
stand-up comedy,

1131
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:28,200
no matter what.

1132
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:31,233
I'll tell you one thing--

1133
00:48:31,233 --> 00:48:32,967
if I was ever
in a situation like that

1134
00:48:32,967 --> 00:48:34,900
and the day ever came
where I couldn't wipe myself,

1135
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:37,400
that's when I call
Kevorkian.

1136
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:40,333
"Come on down, Jack.
You know, I need--
I need your help.

1137
00:48:40,333 --> 00:48:42,800
I'm checking out.
Bring the injection."

1138
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:47,700
And, you know,
that's when mercy killing
should be tolerated.

1139
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:50,100
Thanks for
getting me this gig,
'cause I'm really...

1140
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:52,967
- ...just delighted
with this whole thing.

1141
00:48:56,066 --> 00:48:58,200
I think we've come
to the end of the line here.

1142
00:49:00,633 --> 00:49:03,600
I know, I know,
it's very disappointing
to all of you.

1143
00:49:05,033 --> 00:49:07,033
And me, too.
Me, too.

1144
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:11,867
But, you know,

1145
00:49:11,867 --> 00:49:16,767
this is what happens
when you run out of nothing.

1146
00:49:16,767 --> 00:49:19,333
- Thank you very much.
Good night.

1147
00:49:19,333 --> 00:49:21,834
He's not good
with himself.

1148
00:49:21,834 --> 00:49:24,367
He's not at peace with himself
after he bombs

1149
00:49:24,367 --> 00:49:27,500
until he goes
up onstage again
and does well.

1150
00:49:31,066 --> 00:49:33,633
I don't talk to him
about the concert

1151
00:49:33,633 --> 00:49:36,533
because I know that'll only
bring out a sense of anxiety.

1152
00:49:36,533 --> 00:49:38,867
So I don't bring it up.
We'll go there, we'll shoot it.

1153
00:49:38,867 --> 00:49:41,700
It'll be zip in, zip out.
That's it.

1154
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:43,367
He's not gonna bomb,
he's gonna kill.

1155
00:49:43,367 --> 00:49:45,734
He's gonna just--
he's gonna devastate.

1156
00:49:45,734 --> 00:49:47,767
This is gonna be
the best concert special

1157
00:49:47,767 --> 00:49:50,233
that they've had in years,
really.

1158
00:49:50,233 --> 00:49:53,367
They're gonna be shocked
by how he's going to kill.

1159
00:49:53,367 --> 00:49:55,500
They might ask him
to do another one right away.

1160
00:50:58,266 --> 00:50:59,667
Man:
Okay, that's good.

1161
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:19,133
Good afternoon, HBO.

1162
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:23,567
One moment, please.

1163
00:51:23,567 --> 00:51:25,800
- Hi.
- Hi, Larry David to see
Allan Wasserman.

1164
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:26,934
Sure.

1165
00:51:30,333 --> 00:51:31,734
Hi, Susan?

1166
00:51:31,734 --> 00:51:34,066
I have Larry David here
to see Allan.

1167
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:37,967
- Um, actually, no.

1168
00:51:37,967 --> 00:51:39,166
But it's kind of urgent.

1169
00:51:39,166 --> 00:51:41,166
He says no,
but it's kind of urgent.

1170
00:51:41,166 --> 00:51:42,467
Well, you know,
it's not like

1171
00:51:42,467 --> 00:51:44,300
an emergency or anything,
but it's important.

1172
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:45,900
Well, he says it's not
really an emergency,

1173
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:47,734
but it's important, so.

1174
00:51:47,734 --> 00:51:51,834
- You know, I just basically
need to talk to him.
- Okay, sure.

1175
00:51:51,834 --> 00:51:53,867
- It'll just be
a couple of minutes.

1176
00:51:53,867 --> 00:51:57,233
Good afternoon, HBO.
Sure.

1177
00:51:57,233 --> 00:51:58,700
- Hey.

1178
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:01,867
- Oh, he's not here today.

1179
00:52:01,867 --> 00:52:03,200
- No. No.

1180
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,467
- Oh, I see.
Have a seat.
- Okay.

1181
00:52:07,734 --> 00:52:09,400
Oh. Judy's gonna be
joining us.

1182
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,967
- Oh, all right.
- There she is!

1183
00:52:10,967 --> 00:52:13,767
What's going on?
- Hi. Good.

1184
00:52:13,767 --> 00:52:17,500
Well, I'm sorry,
but it looks like

1185
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:20,500
I'm not gonna be able
to do the special,
the show.

1186
00:52:22,367 --> 00:52:23,266
What happened?

1187
00:52:24,867 --> 00:52:26,867
It's my stepfather.

1188
00:52:26,867 --> 00:52:30,133
He, um-- he got
in a car accident

1189
00:52:30,133 --> 00:52:33,200
and he's in a--
yeah, he's in a coma,

1190
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:36,033
and, uh, I gotta go
to Florida

1191
00:52:36,033 --> 00:52:38,233
to deal with my mother.

1192
00:52:38,233 --> 00:52:40,266
- God.
- It's all her fault.

1193
00:52:40,266 --> 00:52:42,600
- Yeah, she, uh--

1194
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:45,133
Well, she made him
put his seatbelt on

1195
00:52:45,133 --> 00:52:48,233
while he was driving
and he couldn't coordinate it

1196
00:52:48,233 --> 00:52:49,467
and hit a pole.

1197
00:52:51,333 --> 00:52:53,900
- So...

1198
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:56,400
No, he's in a coma.

1199
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,367
He's in a coma,
but he's in and out
of the coma.

1200
00:52:58,367 --> 00:53:01,066
So, he comes in,
he goes out--
I don't know.

1201
00:53:01,066 --> 00:53:02,967
At this point,
we're 48 hours away.

1202
00:53:02,967 --> 00:53:06,266
Yeah, I know.
Tell me about it.

1203
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:09,767
- It's a terrible tragedy...
- I was so psyched and ready
for it, too.

1204
00:53:09,767 --> 00:53:11,367
I think you should
really consider

1205
00:53:11,367 --> 00:53:13,266
trying to go through
with it at this point.

1206
00:53:13,266 --> 00:53:14,934
Well, you know, Allan,
I have to tell you

1207
00:53:14,934 --> 00:53:17,100
there's no way
that I can do it
because...

1208
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:20,066
you know, I even broached
this idea to my mother,

1209
00:53:20,066 --> 00:53:22,667
and she just
completely broke down.

1210
00:53:22,667 --> 00:53:24,433
- Totally broke down.

1211
00:53:24,433 --> 00:53:25,800
She-- she fell
on the floor.

1212
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,500
They had to pick her up
to put her back on the phone.

1213
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:28,600
Allan:
She's in shock, of course.

1214
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:31,166
Are you close
to your father?

1215
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:33,133
- I mean...
- Stepfather.

1216
00:53:33,133 --> 00:53:35,800
Oh, sorry.
Are you close to him?

1217
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:38,967
Well, not really.

1218
00:53:38,967 --> 00:53:41,600
We went fishing
a couple of times
together.

1219
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,433
Um...

1220
00:53:43,433 --> 00:53:48,867
But we had a good time
out in the boat
that afternoon.

1221
00:53:48,867 --> 00:53:50,934
We had such a good time,
we went back again
the second time.

1222
00:53:50,934 --> 00:53:52,867
Allan:
Can't somebody else
go down there and...

1223
00:53:52,867 --> 00:53:56,233
- You have no other--
nobody down there for--
- No, no, she needs me.

1224
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:57,900
- I mean, I'm her son.
- What if we were to hire

1225
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:00,600
a primary caregiver who--
a professional in that field?

1226
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:02,200
It's not the same.
It's not family.

1227
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,166
I mean,
you should have heard her
on the phone last night.

1228
00:54:04,166 --> 00:54:06,433
"Larry, Larry, please.
I need you.

1229
00:54:06,433 --> 00:54:08,467
Don't-- Larry,
you have to come!
Larry!"

1230
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:12,533
Okay.

1231
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:15,834
Terrible timing.

1232
00:54:15,834 --> 00:54:18,133
I mean,
this is not just like
a gig at The Improv, Larry.

1233
00:54:18,133 --> 00:54:19,200
- I know, I understand.
- Give me a break here.

1234
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,767
I totally-- you know,
give you a break?

1235
00:54:21,767 --> 00:54:26,200
- My stepfather is in a coma
in the hospital, all right?
- Allan: I know, I understand.

1236
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:27,967
That's the most
important thing right now.

1237
00:54:27,967 --> 00:54:31,400
So let's-- you know,
this is show business, okay?

1238
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:34,400
- I mean...
- It's a very
difficult situation.

1239
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,800
- There's no bad people.
- Larry: Right.

1240
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:38,166
- It's a bad situation.
- No, no. True, true.

1241
00:54:38,166 --> 00:54:41,633
I need some
sort of idea when we can
resume schedule here.

1242
00:54:41,633 --> 00:54:43,633
You know what,
we're just gonna have to wait
and see what happens.

1243
00:54:43,633 --> 00:54:46,333
- Allan: We need to have
some kind of a schedule.
- I can't give you a schedule,

1244
00:54:46,333 --> 00:54:48,266
'cause I don't--
I'm not in charge of comas.

1245
00:54:48,266 --> 00:54:50,033
I've never dealt
with a coma before.

1246
00:54:50,033 --> 00:54:52,033
I have no coma experience,
so I don't know.

1247
00:54:52,033 --> 00:54:55,367
Well, does she
understand that--
what is at stake here?

1248
00:54:55,367 --> 00:54:57,467
She totally understands.
She doesn't care.

1249
00:54:57,467 --> 00:55:00,767
It's-- you have to cancel it,
and, you know, we'll reassess

1250
00:55:00,767 --> 00:55:02,834
once I get down there and see
what the situation is.

1251
00:55:02,834 --> 00:55:04,700
Would we be able
to contact you there?

1252
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:06,600
I'll call you.
Yeah, I'll call you.

1253
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:07,934
I'll let you know
what's going on.

1254
00:55:07,934 --> 00:55:10,500
The show's over
for right now.

1255
00:55:13,433 --> 00:55:16,066
I gotta fly to Florida now.

1256
00:55:16,066 --> 00:55:18,667
Oh, God,
what a nightmare.

1257
00:55:18,667 --> 00:55:21,266
- Guess I gotta
get on the phone.
- Right.

1258
00:55:21,266 --> 00:55:23,033
- All right.
- Yeah, you go do that.

1259
00:55:23,033 --> 00:55:26,233
- I've got a lot
of work to do.
- Okay.

1260
00:55:26,233 --> 00:55:30,166
Well, you know, death,
it's a part of life.

1261
00:55:32,433 --> 00:55:34,433
We're lucky to be alive.

1262
00:55:36,133 --> 00:55:37,767
- All right.
- Okay.

1263
00:55:37,767 --> 00:55:39,467
- Okay.
- Take care.

1264
00:55:39,467 --> 00:55:41,166
- All right. Bye.
- Allan: All right, bye.

1265
00:55:43,367 --> 00:55:46,967
Larry, if anything else
is going on,

1266
00:55:46,967 --> 00:55:48,834
now is the time
to tell me.

1267
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,200
I don't know what
you're implying by that...

1268
00:55:54,967 --> 00:55:56,734
but I swear
on my children's lives...

1269
00:55:56,734 --> 00:55:58,166
Say no more.

1270
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:12,633
Validation, please.

1271
00:56:14,333 --> 00:56:16,300
- Larry.
- Hey.

1272
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:17,667
How you doing?

1273
00:56:17,667 --> 00:56:19,734
What-- what are you do--
you didn't get the job?

1274
00:56:19,734 --> 00:56:22,066
Obviously not, huh?

1275
00:56:22,066 --> 00:56:23,633
I'm shocked.

1276
00:56:23,633 --> 00:56:26,800
I heard that was, uh,
quite a recommendation
you gave me.

1277
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,667
Oh. Well, I-- you know,
I called up and the guy--

1278
00:56:29,667 --> 00:56:31,533
- You insulted the guy.
- I didn't insult the guy.

1279
00:56:31,533 --> 00:56:34,066
- That's what he said you did.
- No, that's not accurate.

1280
00:56:34,066 --> 00:56:35,433
- That is not accurate.

1281
00:56:35,433 --> 00:56:37,767
I called up
and he insulted me.

1282
00:56:37,767 --> 00:56:39,467
He-- he made a crack
about the show--

1283
00:56:39,467 --> 00:56:40,800
"Never watched it,
not a fan."

1284
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:42,734
Well, so what?
Not everybody likes the show.

1285
00:56:42,734 --> 00:56:43,934
Of course they don't
like the show.

1286
00:56:43,934 --> 00:56:45,500
I don't expect them
to like the show, but now--

1287
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:46,500
But you didn't have
to insult the guy
on the phone.

1288
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:48,200
Could you validate this
for me, please?

1289
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:50,967
- Thanks.
- He told me that you
insulted him on the phone

1290
00:56:50,967 --> 00:56:52,800
and then you sent him
a letter afterwards,

1291
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:55,300
- adding insult to injury.
- I wrote him--
it's about an hour.

1292
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:58,033
I wrote him
a very nice letter,
a beautiful letter.

1293
00:56:58,033 --> 00:57:00,467
- And--
- Yeah, he told me
about that as well.

1294
00:57:00,467 --> 00:57:03,200
And I said
some wonderful things
about you in the letter.

1295
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,767
Well, if you had said
such wonderful things,

1296
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:06,767
- why would I be sitting
behind this desk?
- I don't know.

1297
00:57:06,767 --> 00:57:08,200
It's bewildering, frankly.

1298
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,734
- Yeah, to me, too.
- I'm quite puzzled by it.

1299
00:57:09,734 --> 00:57:11,467
- Me, too.
- I'm puzzled
by the whole thing.

1300
00:57:11,467 --> 00:57:13,633
Well, he said
that you insulted him
at the end of the letter

1301
00:57:13,633 --> 00:57:15,834
and virtually took back
everything that you had said.

1302
00:57:15,834 --> 00:57:17,567
I didn't insult him at all.
You know what?

1303
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:20,000
Um, you're better off
because the guy's an idiot

1304
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,734
and you wouldn't have
even liked working for him.

1305
00:57:21,734 --> 00:57:24,433
- I don't care.
It was a great opportunity.
- Believe me, opportunity--

1306
00:57:24,433 --> 00:57:26,500
