Well our primary suspect is CoCo,

430
00:18:53,068 --> 00:18:55,538
and we're certain that she
is the leader of the pack.

431
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,218
I saw all four of those girls together

432
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,938
while I was undercover at a pool party,

433
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,058

names for the other girls.

Not the group, just the individual.

So our plan is to be part of your team,

437
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,595
infiltrate the whole organization

438
00:19:08,597 --> 00:19:11,395

Who they work for?

440
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,918
Yeah, from all the intel
that we've been getting,

441
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,458
we're finding out that this girl, Coco,

442
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,948
had to have somebody much
bigger in the picture.

443
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:22,578
Couldn't have done it by herself.

00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,303
Any leads to her whereabouts?

00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,148

That's what I like to hear.

451
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,535
So I suggest we go ahead

452
00:19:37,537 --> 00:19:39,838

00:23:56,504 --> 00:23:59,254
You buy 10 pieces, I send you 30.

545
00:24:00,531 --> 00:24:01,918
I buy 10, you send me 30?

546
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:05,028
- [Po] Yeah.
- What's the catch?

547
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:08,628
[Po] Catch is, it's every two weeks.

548
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:09,583
Consistent.

549
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:17,158
What you think about that?

550
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,798
At the number I'm getting,

551
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,088
30 pieces every two weeks.

552
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:23,804
[Po] Every two weeks.

553
00:24:23,806 --> 00:24:25,528
I mean, that's a little challenging,

554
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:26,791
that's hard.

555
00:24:26,793 --> 00:24:28,751
I mean, I'm sure it's
not the 30 pieces, my dude.

556
00:24:28,753 --> 00:24:31,018
That shit sells itself.

557
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,528
Is it the price?

558
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:35,960
At the end of the day, I think
you're a pretty smart dude.

559
00:24:35,962 --> 00:24:36,793
[Sha speaks indistinctly]

560
00:24:36,795 --> 00:24:38,855
[Po sighs]

561
00:24:38,857 --> 00:24:40,799
You ain't talk to him?

562
00:24:40,801 --> 00:24:44,275
[Carmen] I'ma leave that to you, Papa.

563
00:24:44,277 --> 00:24:47,190
Aight, man. I think it's the price.

564
00:24:47,192 --> 00:24:49,308
This is what I'm about to do.

565
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:51,453
I'll take $5,000 off these bird.

566
00:24:52,329 --> 00:24:54,591
What you think about that now?

567
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:58,008
If you can take five
grand off each bird.

568
00:24:58,010 --> 00:24:59,967
- Each bird.
- We're in business.

569
00:24:59,969 --> 00:25:01,728
That's what's up, brother.

570
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:02,713
Only problem now,

I got that taken care of.

575
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,817
You supply the food. I got that.

576
00:25:14,819 --> 00:25:16,787
I like that.

577
00:25:16,789 --> 00:25:18,258

578
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,998
So we waiting on you then, man.

Let's go. Can I go now?

581
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,638
I mean, you could go now.

582
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,473
Okay.

583
00:25:27,522 --> 00:25:30,855
[dramatic music begins]

584
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,800
Benny, I'm leaving.

585
00:25:50,028 --> 00:25:52,945
All right, well, have a good night.

586
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,180
Who do you know?

587
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:30,881
[scoffs]

588
00:26:46,228 --> 00:26:47,561
Who do you know?

589
00:27:03,197 --> 00:27:06,457
I'm going to start
doing whatever I want.

590
00:27:08,957 --> 00:27:12,773
When I am satisfied, I'm
going to ask a question.

591
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:18,898
If I get the remote inclination
you are lying to me,

592
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,505
I'm going to make what I was doing before

593
00:27:20,507 --> 00:27:23,330
look like fucking hand holding.

594
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,890
So, she talk?

595
00:27:31,336 --> 00:27:32,597
[Man] Nyet.

596
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:35,167
[Vika laughs]

597
00:27:35,169 --> 00:27:36,414
Vika!

598
00:27:36,416 --> 00:27:39,188
[speaking Russian]

599
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,173
Don't kill her yet.

600
00:27:42,125 --> 00:27:43,408
[Vika speaking Russian]

601
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:44,543
Go get my chair.

602
00:28:13,057 --> 00:28:13,974
Okay, easy.

603
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:20,020
All I want to know is who did
you tell about duffel bag?

604
00:28:21,682 --> 00:28:22,859
I don't know.

605
00:28:22,861 --> 00:28:24,111
Okay, enough.

606
00:28:26,166 --> 00:28:27,416
Enough of this.

607
00:28:28,803 --> 00:28:32,258
If I have to get up from my chair,

608
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:36,483
I am going to cut your
fingers off one at a time.

609
00:28:39,858 --> 00:28:41,724
Just tell me what I need to know.

610
00:28:41,726 --> 00:28:42,976
I don't know.

611
00:28:49,721 --> 00:28:52,933
[cashier grunts]

612
00:28:52,935 --> 00:28:56,357
Just tell me what I need to know

613
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:57,359
and you can go home.

614
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,527
Okay, okay, I'll tell you.

615
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:04,123
It's Talib.

616
00:29:08,717 --> 00:29:09,633
You see?

617
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:12,177
See how easy that was?

618
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:19,620
Now, I want you to tell me everything

619
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:22,720
that I need to know about this Talib.

620
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:25,413
Okay.

621
00:29:27,117 --> 00:29:28,867
Very good, my dear.

622
00:29:37,879 --> 00:29:39,499
You see?

623
00:29:39,501 --> 00:29:41,757
I didn't want to cut
your fingers off anyway.

624
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:47,848
No, please!

625
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:48,763
Use the hammer.

626
00:29:49,611 --> 00:29:53,188
[cashier sobbing]

627
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:54,913
[Cashier] No, no!

628
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:03,050
[cashier screaming]

629
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,147
Yes, it's me. Look him up.

630
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:21,868

Yes, I know, but look. Listen.

634
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,408
It took me less than 24 hours

635
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:35,241
to figure all this out

636
00:30:35,243 --> 00:30:37,668
without the help of your little bitch.

637
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:39,323
You need to let me stay for good.

638
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,381
So I will find this Talib

639
00:30:46,383 --> 00:30:47,528
and I will find these whores

640
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:49,628
and I'll be back before Sunday.

641
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:52,613
Fine. Fine.

642
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:54,973
Yes.

643
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:10,668
Yo, snap out of it.

644
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:13,790
[Keisha] See, this is my
grimy ass cousin, Muffy.

645
00:31:13,792 --> 00:31:17,208
She one of the few grimy ass
bitches in the land between.

646
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:18,958
They lined some getting
money niggas for us

647
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,638
a few times, but there's
something about this bitch

648
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,243
I just can't put my finger on.

649
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:26,056
No, you don't understand.

650
00:31:26,058 --> 00:31:27,658
I'ma keep it 100 with you.

651
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:30,138
What the fuck was you expecting?

652
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,508
The picket fence?

653
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:33,098
The motherfucking house on the prairie?

654
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,118
This life you living wasn't given to you.

655
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,618
Your mom's a G, your daddy
ain't never coming home.

656
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,451
You're bugging.

657
00:31:39,453 --> 00:31:41,165
Like what the fuck was you expecting?

658
00:31:41,167 --> 00:31:42,818
You don't understand,
this man showing me

659
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,128
a whole different lifestyle.

660
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:46,038
Something I never seen before,

661
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,498
like I ain't ever have to
resort back to the streets

662
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,158
ever again due to this man.

663
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,078
Yo, shit happens for a reason,

664
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,342
and in every worse situation,

665
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:55,968
you gotta take the best elements out of it

666
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:57,253
and concentrate on that.

667
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:01,220
What the fuck are you saying?

668
00:32:01,222 --> 00:32:02,288
Fuck it.

669
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:03,798
Let me speak in your language, all right?

670
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,631
Speak English.

671
00:32:04,633 --> 00:32:06,868
You gotta take the good
with the bad, Keisha.

672
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:07,703
You know that.

673
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,248
At this point right now,

674
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:11,081
I'm going through a lot.

675
00:32:11,083 --> 00:32:12,848
I got niggas after me, bitches after me.

676
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:14,245
I don't even know which
way to go at this point.

677
00:32:14,247 --> 00:32:17,528
And this is exactly
why your ass need to be

678
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:19,908
not daydreaming about fucking Jack,

679
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:22,618
staying focused, and don't
be out here slipping.

680
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:25,174
Matter of fact, did you
find out who shot your man?

681
00:32:25,176 --> 00:32:27,848
Let me tell you, I had
this nigga the other night.

682
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:31,128
This bitch Kayla aunt is on my body.

683
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:32,958
I can't get away from this bitch.

684
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,428
Wait, Kayla's aunt?

685
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:36,001
Listen, that's the bitch

686
00:32:36,003 --> 00:32:37,468
trying to get at me.

687
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:38,588
She think I got something to do

688
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:39,488
with Kayla getting killed.

689
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:40,998
Like this bitch is on me!

690
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,143
Wait, wait, what?

691
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:46,837
Let me tell you about this.

692
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:51,422
[slow motion, indistinct conversation]

693
00:33:08,113 --> 00:33:09,198
[gunshot fires]

694
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,595
[Muffy] Wait, wait, wait.

695
00:33:10,597 --> 00:33:11,428
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

696
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:13,558
Let me see if I understand.

697
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:16,673
Tyler kills Kayla but the aunt blames you?

698
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:19,668
Yeah, and now everywhere I go,

699
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:21,818
this bitch just been popping up.

700
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:22,798
I can't shake her.

701
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,078
Popping up, like on some straight

702
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,758
following you shit?

703
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,468
Yo, you need to take care of that.

704
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:29,058
You need me to stay up here longer?

705
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,528
Because a bitch will cancel her shit.

706
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:31,448
I'll stay.

707
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:32,358
Nah, I got this.

708
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,678
I promise you, I'ma take care of this.

709
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,725
Let me get rid of these little
headaches I gotta handle

710
00:33:36,727 --> 00:33:37,971
and I'm coming to see you

711
00:33:37,973 --> 00:33:40,418
because I gotta get the fuck out of here.

712
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,475
Keish, look.

713
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:43,358
You got a lot of shit going on up here,

714
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,840
but you know my home is your home.

715
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,958
Yo, I gotta go.

716
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,078
I gotta catch this flight.

717
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,913
Fuck it, we outta here.

718
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:01,598
[Keisha] See, these is

00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,278
Coco and Kyah.

720
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,400
Coco's really my day one,

721
00:34:05,402 --> 00:34:08,108
and Kyah, we got cool
after this one job we did.

722
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:12,378
I kinda slept on her, but sis gets busy.

723
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,318
I'm thinking about it.

724
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,201
Ain't nothing wrong with that.

725
00:34:15,203 --> 00:34:17,993
I just had to know,
but what that nigga do?

726
00:34:18,831 --> 00:34:20,255
I don't know, he just be telling me

727
00:34:20,257 --> 00:34:22,548

and shit like that.

728
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:23,781
How you don't know?

729
00:34:23,783 --> 00:34:25,888
Here you go, acting like Keisha with it,

730
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:27,368
with this falling in love shit.

731
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:28,970
Like, do you even know his name?

732
00:34:30,184 --> 00:34:34,242
I do know his name, and his name's KB.

733
00:34:34,244 --> 00:34:35,161
Hm, okay.

734
00:34:37,164 --> 00:34:39,748
But I'm thinking about asking him

735
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:42,741
to put us onto this investments
that he so called do,

736
00:34:42,743 --> 00:34:45,438
because I'm trying to make
this money work for us.

737
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,198
Look, I'm all for that shit.

738
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,008
I ain't trying to look back.

739
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:50,920
Word, but I'm going.

740
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:53,362
Aight, you got some gas money?

741
00:34:53,364 --> 00:34:54,383

742
00:34:54,385 --> 00:34:57,468
- [laughs]
- All right.

743
00:35:09,859 --> 00:35:10,690
What's going on?

744
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:12,594
What it do? What you been up to?

745
00:35:12,596 --> 00:35:13,482

00:35:13,484 --> 00:35:14,976
Yeah, what's going on with you?

747
00:35:14,978 --> 00:35:15,930
Same shit, man.

748
00:35:15,932 --> 00:35:17,059
So where my boy?

749
00:35:17,061 --> 00:35:17,910
He in the back.

750
00:35:17,912 --> 00:35:18,745
Hey, yo!

751
00:35:20,127 --> 00:35:20,958
Hey, what up?

752
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,888
I told you you'd be back for my Adidas.

753
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:23,407
Kept them out for you anyway.

754
00:35:25,263 --> 00:35:26,558
[Keisha] This is Quick,

755
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,488
Sha right hand man.

756
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:30,490
He basically handles all the dirty work.

757
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:32,521
That's about it though.

758
00:35:32,523 --> 00:35:35,038
The trip was all right.
Everything else was bad.

759
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,632
Just left them people.

760
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:37,508
They talking about cutting us off,

761
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,418
Cutting us apart from every G.

762
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,251
Cutting us off?

763
00:35:40,253 --> 00:35:42,247
My nigga, our money's
always right in the zap.

764
00:35:42,249 --> 00:35:43,498
My nigga, we always on
time with everything.

765
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,558
Yeah, you're right with that,

766
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,537
but it's not about the money.

767
00:35:46,539 --> 00:35:47,498
It's about all these shootings.

768
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:50,358
I mean, about the shit with
Bug and Syme and all them.

769
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,498
Nigga said, "Yo, it's bad for business."

770
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,158
I mean, this is basically,

771
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,188
I didn't even think I was gonna make it

772
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,718
out of that motherfucker alive, yo.

773
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,167
Nigga was so pissed off.

774
00:36:01,772 --> 00:36:03,482
The nigga even offered
the motherfucking help

775
00:36:03,484 --> 00:36:05,308
to get rid of these niggas.

776
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:06,160
Why not though?

777
00:36:07,036 --> 00:36:07,867
Why?

778
00:36:07,869 --> 00:36:09,718
Why I wanna get deep with these people?

779
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:13,488
I mean, once the motherfuckers
come down here and do that,

780
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:16,851
what kind of debt you think
we gonna be in to them then?

781
00:36:16,853 --> 00:36:18,216
I don't know.

782
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:19,241
I mean, we got our own shit.

783
00:36:19,243 --> 00:36:21,075
We don't need them. No killers.

784
00:36:21,077 --> 00:36:23,698
The shit about it is, them
niggas is hitting moves.

785
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:26,184
We gotta find a way to move
the way we're supposed to move.

786
00:36:26,186 --> 00:36:28,432
Get on these niggas.

787
00:36:28,434 --> 00:36:29,778
All y'all do is sit back and think.

788
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:31,528
We smarter than fucking Syme

789
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:33,188
and that piece of shit Bug.

790
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,240
We smarter than them.

791
00:36:35,488 --> 00:36:38,419
Sha, get on it and get
them niggas out of here.

792
00:36:38,421 --> 00:36:40,574
What's up with that
piece of shit nigga, D?

793
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,503
What are you paying him for?

794
00:36:42,435 --> 00:36:43,578
Yo, matter of fact,

00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,748

796
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:47,425
I'm about to give that

00:36:47,427 --> 00:36:49,028
As soon as I leave here,
I'm gonna get in my car,

798
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:51,134
I'm gonna give that nigga a call.

799
00:36:51,136 --> 00:36:53,251
You gonna have him get rid of them,

800
00:36:53,253 --> 00:36:54,084
then we gonna get rid of him.

801
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:55,493

You always say the same shit.

You know it, man.

807
00:37:12,315 --> 00:37:15,009
I got you, man. I'm

808
00:37:15,011 --> 00:37:17,761

00:37:23,427 --> 00:37:24,927
Hey yo, Fat Boy.

810
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,693
My nigga, why that shit ain't

811
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:30,938

That shit is not done, my nigga.

814
00:37:33,669 --> 00:37:35,488
That shit is not right.

815
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:37,640
Niggas is on my neck,

816
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:41,528

Asap, boy!

820
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:46,613

821
00:37:48,893 --> 00:37:51,948
[Smith] All right, team. We got a call.

822
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:53,458
They're at the diner.

823
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:54,478
Cruz, I'ma need you on the west.

824
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,128
KB, I'ma need you on the east.

825
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:57,458
Lewis, I need you to
apprehend his girlfriend

826
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:58,528
in case he gone.

827
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:00,763
Detective Anderson, I
need you to cover me.

828
00:38:00,765 --> 00:38:02,248
- Copy.
- All right?

829
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:03,083
Let's move.

830
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:05,888
[Keisha] This ill ass nigga

831
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:08,548

832
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:10,168
and gonna drop the nigga in broad daylight

833
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:11,958
in the middle of the park.

834
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,698
He's bugging.

835
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:16,418
That's what he got his man, Syme, for.

836
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,197
But this why we call him Bugowt.

837
00:38:19,508 --> 00:38:24,091
I'll be there as quick as
I can get there, all right?

838
00:38:25,097 --> 00:38:26,799
What's wrong with you?

839
00:38:26,801 --> 00:38:28,155
Nothing.

840
00:38:28,157 --> 00:38:30,629
Yo, I know I be busy out in the streets,

841
00:38:30,631 --> 00:38:31,758
but you gotta always remember,

842
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,434
I'm doing it for the family.

843
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:34,267
Really?

844
00:38:34,269 --> 00:38:36,818
You have to make time,
quality time at that,

845
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:37,651
for your family.

846
00:38:37,653 --> 00:38:38,777
You know that.

847
00:38:38,779 --> 00:38:39,741
Yeah, I know. I know.

848
00:38:39,743 --> 00:38:41,738
But once I handle this shit in New York,

849
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,293
we gonna be straight.

850
00:38:43,295 --> 00:38:44,126
Don't worry about it.

851
00:38:44,128 --> 00:38:44,959
That's all I ask.

852
00:38:44,961 --> 00:38:48,293
I don't ask for much. I really don't.

853
00:38:48,295 --> 00:38:50,965
I'ma go up there to this
deal real quick, all right?

854
00:38:50,967 --> 00:38:53,717
[sirens blaring]

855
00:38:57,544 --> 00:39:00,761
[indistinct shouting]

856
00:39:00,763 --> 00:39:01,948
Get off me! Get off me!

857
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:05,067
Get the fuck off me.

858
00:39:05,069 --> 00:39:06,851
Stop talking. Relax

859
00:39:06,853 --> 00:39:07,828
Get off me.

860
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:09,425
Get the fuck off me.

861
00:39:09,427 --> 00:39:10,606
Stop talking.

862
00:39:10,608 --> 00:39:13,858
[overlapping shouting]

863
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,573
The money's in the drawer!

864
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:21,280
[Lewis] Calm down right now!

865
00:39:28,948 --> 00:39:29,828
The fuck is this?

866
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:31,880
That's your handiwork right there, man.

867
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:34,858
I got an eyewitness that
put you at the scene

868
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:36,648
with a gun in your hand.

869
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:37,483
So what?

870
00:39:38,646 --> 00:39:39,868
You still gonna make this more difficult

871
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:40,701
than it already is?

872
00:39:40,703 --> 00:39:41,534
So if you got all this,

873
00:39:41,536 --> 00:39:43,018
why the fuck am I here for then?

874
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:45,818
Because we're trying to
figure out why you did it.

875
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:48,498
Is it because of Un or Twin's death,

876
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,058
or you just got some whole other shit

877
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:51,928
going on in the streets?

878
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:53,178
I see what's going on.

879
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,318
Y'all just trying to get something

880
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,775
so y'all can put something together.

881
00:39:55,777 --> 00:39:57,918
But y'all ain't got nothing on me, though.

882
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,058
I see what's going on.

883
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:01,008
Y'all some funny motherfuckers, boy.

884
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:02,539
No, what's funny is, you sitting up here

885
00:40:02,541 --> 00:40:04,427
trying to act all hard and shit.

886
00:40:04,429 --> 00:40:05,260
I'm not hard.

887
00:40:05,262 --> 00:40:06,762
I'm just doing what I do, bro.

888
00:40:07,725 --> 00:40:10,078
It's all good though,
because you'll eventually

889
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,245
bitch up and give us exactly what we want.

890
00:40:12,247 --> 00:40:14,555
That's a great fucking speech, yo.

891
00:40:14,557 --> 00:40:17,371
That shit ever worked on anybody?

892
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:18,208
Can I?

893
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:19,043
Please do.

894
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,613
Robison, I need the room.

895
00:40:28,936 --> 00:40:30,518
The fuck is this, good cop, bad cop?

896
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:33,388
No cop. Agent Turner, FBI.

897
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:35,868
And I'm Agent Cruise, FBI.

898
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:36,858
Okay.

899
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,315
I need you to listen.

900
00:40:38,317 --> 00:40:40,573
You're gonna go down for this body.

901
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:42,543

00:56:34,082 --> 00:56:36,182
What I know is that we have two witnesses,

1256
00:56:37,590 --> 00:56:39,254
but you ain't hear that from me.

1257
00:56:39,256 --> 00:56:40,653
All right, all right.

1258
00:56:40,655 --> 00:56:42,938
You know what you doing, man.

1259
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:44,045
We schedule a hearing

1260
00:56:44,047 --> 00:56:46,158
and I'ma take the stand and
get this shit thrown out.

1261
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:47,918
Matter of fact, call my wife

1262
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:50,987
and tell her and the fellas
to come on my next visit.

1263
00:56:50,989 --> 00:56:52,912
All right, so I'll contact you

1264
00:56:52,914 --> 00:56:54,198
with your next court date

1265
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:55,711
and I'll call your wife as
soon as I get out of here.

1266
00:56:55,713 --> 00:56:58,728
All right, leave me a positive, man.

1267
00:56:58,730 --> 00:56:59,603
I'll do my best.

1268
00:56:59,605 --> 00:57:00,605
All right.

1269
00:57:09,907 --> 00:57:11,482
Can you put it on something else?

1270
00:57:11,484 --> 00:57:12,557
What you wanna watch?

1271
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:13,882
I don't know, let me see.

1272
00:57:13,884 --> 00:57:15,084
No, we're watching this.

1273
00:57:15,086 --> 00:57:16,615
Come on, this is so bad.
[knocking on door]

1274
00:57:16,617 --> 00:57:19,208
Who is that knocking? It's late.

1275
00:57:19,210 --> 00:57:21,204
Oh my fucking God.

1276
00:57:21,206 --> 00:57:23,444
I'm coming, I'm coming. Hold on.

1277
00:57:23,446 --> 00:57:24,686
[knocking continues]

1278
00:57:24,688 --> 00:57:25,521
Yo, chill.

1279
00:57:26,381 --> 00:57:27,212
Shh!

1280
00:57:27,214 --> 00:57:28,045
What the fuck took you so long?

1281
00:57:28,047 --> 00:57:30,097
Yo, I got some shit to tell you.

1282
00:57:30,099 --> 00:57:31,432
What now, man?

1283
00:57:34,594 --> 00:57:35,425
Yo.

1284
00:57:35,427 --> 00:57:36,908
CoCo, what's good?

1285
00:57:36,910 --> 00:57:39,976
What's good, Mecca, with your fine ass?

1286
00:57:39,978 --> 00:57:40,809
All right my nigga, what's up?

1287
00:57:40,811 --> 00:57:42,288
What you doing here this late?

1288
00:57:42,290 --> 00:57:44,658
Thought you'd be with your
Mr. Investor at this time.

1289
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:47,288
Yo, this shit is crazy.

1290
00:57:47,290 --> 00:57:48,253
What's crazy?

1291
00:57:48,255 --> 00:57:49,086
What are you talking about?

1292
00:57:49,088 --> 00:57:50,188
This nigga is a fed.

1293
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:54,128
The fuck you mean, this nigga's a fed?

1294
00:57:54,130 --> 00:57:55,968
Yo, he dropped his wallet.

1295
00:57:55,970 --> 00:57:58,008
I went to go pick it up, it opened.

1296
00:57:58,010 --> 00:58:00,868
I seen the badge, ID, everything.

1297
00:58:00,870 --> 00:58:02,918
Okay, so what's up?

1298
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:06,048
I don't know, I guess it's just his job.

1299
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:07,418
Just his job?

1300
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:08,858
This what the fuck I'm talking about.

1301
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:11,108
You and Keisha in Lala
Land over some dick.

1302
00:58:11,110 --> 00:58:13,268
That's why I keep my bitch around.

1303
00:58:13,270 --> 00:58:14,568
Yo.

1304
00:58:14,570 --> 00:58:15,401
It's not like I'ma tell him

1305
00:58:15,403 --> 00:58:18,630
what the fuck we do,
so what's the problem?

1306
00:58:18,632 --> 00:58:20,288
What's the problem?

1307
00:58:20,290 --> 00:58:22,808
The problem is, you're a fucking criminal

1308
00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:24,354
and he's FBI.

1309
00:58:24,356 --> 00:58:25,187
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1310
00:58:25,189 --> 00:58:27,288
You stupid, or you just dumb?

1311
00:58:27,290 --> 00:58:28,848
Yo, listen, just give me some time

1312
00:58:28,850 --> 00:58:30,068
to figure this shit out,

1313
00:58:30,070 --> 00:58:32,293
and don't tell Keisha nothing.

1314
00:58:33,224 --> 00:58:34,358
I'ma figure this shit out.

1315
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:36,838
I mean, it's not like he investigating me.

1316
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:38,618
Plus, I already let the nigga smash,

1317
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:40,063
so I feel crazy as hell.

1318
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:44,468
Aight, smash away. Let me walk you out.

1319
00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:45,318
You kicking me out?

1320
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:47,019
You sounding real crazy right now.

1321
00:58:47,021 --> 00:58:48,938
You gotta go right now.

1322
00:58:59,033 --> 00:59:00,548
That bitch crazy.

1323
00:59:00,550 --> 00:59:02,282
Yeah, I told you.

1324
00:59:02,284 --> 00:59:03,780
Whatever.

1325
00:59:03,782 --> 00:59:04,721
Mm-mm.

1326
00:59:04,723 --> 00:59:06,618
What's your problem now?

1327
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:08,265
You know you gotta handle that, right?

1328
00:59:08,267 --> 00:59:09,238
Handle what?

1329
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:10,187
Nigga, that fed.

1330
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:13,208
Regardless how long they
been rocking with each other,

1331
00:59:13,210 --> 00:59:15,159
he should have told her what he was into

1332
00:59:15,161 --> 00:59:15,992
from the beginning.

1333
00:59:15,994 --> 00:59:17,688
You trying to take that chance?

1334
00:59:17,690 --> 00:59:19,068
No, I got you.

1335
00:59:19,070 --> 00:59:22,830
I got you, I got you.

1336
00:59:24,029 --> 00:59:25,181
Thank you.

1337
00:59:25,183 --> 00:59:26,311
Let me pick something to watch now.

1338
00:59:26,313 --> 00:59:27,146
Mm!

1339
00:59:30,546 --> 00:59:32,668
[Keisha] This is Mimi, little grimy ass.

1340
00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:36,038
She the leader of my cousin's
little grimy ass crew.

1341
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:37,548
Trust me when I tell y'all,

00:59:37,550 --> 00:59:39,107

1343
00:59:39,109 --> 00:59:43,109
[indistinct phone conversation]

1344

[dramatic music begins]

1345
00:59:51,373 --> 00:59:53,040
Yes. No, I'm back.

1346
00:59:53,964 --> 00:59:55,752
I'm actually at the shop now,

1347

1350
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:10,345
Abby, you still in here?

1351
01:00:10,347 --> 01:00:11,747
You getting them coins, boo?

1352
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:14,500
Yeah, something like that.

1353
01:00:16,230 --> 01:00:18,352
Muff, can you get over here?

1354
01:00:18,354 --> 01:00:19,419
It's important.

1355
01:00:19,421 --> 01:00:21,921
All right, give me a second.

1356
01:00:24,363 --> 01:00:27,259
I got you, let me call you back.

1357
01:00:27,261 --> 01:00:29,950
What is the dilly?

1358
01:00:29,952 --> 01:00:31,421
What's up?

1359
01:00:31,423 --> 01:00:34,173
[gun shots fire]

1360
01:00:35,803 --> 01:00:37,720
Come here. Come here.

1361
01:00:39,797 --> 01:00:42,235
Come on, the fuck over there.

1362
01:00:42,237 --> 01:00:43,576
Oh, you got the drop on me?

1363
01:00:43,578 --> 01:00:44,409
Yeah, you right.

1364
01:00:44,411 --> 01:00:46,032
Fuck boy and fuck you, nigga.

1365
01:00:46,034 --> 01:00:46,888
You need a gun for me?

1366
01:00:46,890 --> 01:00:48,291
Bitch ass nigga.

[loud smack, object clatters]

1368
01:00:51,251 --> 01:00:52,082
What's up?

1369
01:00:52,084 --> 01:00:53,533
I don't hear you now.

1370
01:00:55,435 --> 01:00:56,268
Get up!

1371
01:00:57,265 --> 01:00:58,538
I can't get up.

1372
01:00:58,540 --> 01:01:00,490
Fuck me, you still talking shit, huh?

1373
01:01:02,183 --> 01:01:04,101
I don't need a gun?

1374
01:01:04,103 --> 01:01:07,353
You know what, I got something for you.

1375
01:01:12,190 --> 01:01:13,523
Get your ass up.

1376
01:01:14,723 --> 01:01:16,890
Stand your fucking ass up.

1377
01:01:19,881 --> 01:01:22,662
Mimi didn't tell me it
was gonna be this fun.

1378
01:01:22,664 --> 01:01:24,900
Running up on bitches easy.

1379
01:01:24,902 --> 01:01:27,741
Told you I didn't need no gun.

1380
01:01:27,743 --> 01:01:30,009
[bottle shatters]

1381
01:01:30,011 --> 01:01:30,844
Shit!

1383
01:01:36,976 --> 01:01:38,626
What the fuck you do to my face?

1384
01:01:38,628 --> 01:01:42,211
[dramatic music continues]

1385
01:01:46,943 --> 01:01:49,276
[gun fires]

1386
01:02:10,291 --> 01:02:11,124
Nigga.

1387
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:18,130
[Man] My inner self's telling

Yo, you keep talking

1392
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:28,378
[Keisha] This is Life.

1393

Mimi little grimy ass
put him on the plate.

1394
01:02:31,070 --> 01:02:32,858
Now she's on his menu,

1395
01:02:32,860 --> 01:02:34,308
and let's see how this play out.

1396
01:02:34,310 --> 01:02:36,010
We keep beating around the bush.

1397
01:02:37,990 --> 01:02:38,823
First of all,

1398
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:42,662
I don't know what the
fuck you talking about.

1399
01:02:42,664 --> 01:02:45,291
You talking about this bitch in my office.

1400
01:02:45,293 --> 01:02:47,393
Nigga, who you calling a bitch?

1401
01:02:47,395 --> 01:02:48,895
Babe, chill out.

1402
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:55,063
Look, end of this shit,

1403
01:02:56,350 --> 01:02:58,308
I need her out of my office

1404
01:02:58,310 --> 01:02:59,546
and we need to talk.

1405
01:02:59,548 --> 01:03:02,798
Listen, man, me and my girl good, man.

01:03:06,030 --> 01:03:07,208
so at the end of the day-

1408
01:03:07,210 --> 01:03:08,627
- Who the fuck y'all talking about?

1409
01:03:08,629 --> 01:03:09,928
You talking about that bitch Mimi?

1410
01:03:09,930 --> 01:03:11,686
Babe, please, relax.

1411
01:03:11,688 --> 01:03:13,589
Why your bitch talking

End of the day, my girl here to help.

1416
01:03:20,950 --> 01:03:22,898

so let's talk about your girl.

1418

What we doing about what?

1420
01:03:28,545 --> 01:03:30,365
Get your bitch out of my office or-

1421
01:03:30,367 --> 01:03:31,741
- Say bitch one more time.

1422
01:03:31,743 --> 01:03:35,669
Babe, I got it. Relax.

1423
01:03:35,671 --> 01:03:38,368
At the end of the day, you know what I do.

1424
01:03:38,370 --> 01:03:41,555
We can leave this bitch
body scattered around 285.

1425
01:03:41,557 --> 01:03:42,833
That's right, baby.

1426
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:45,723
Body parts around the whole circle.

1427
01:03:46,743 --> 01:03:47,988
What you trying to do?

1428
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:50,000
First of all, I ain't trying

1429
01:03:50,002 --> 01:03:51,018

1430
01:03:51,020 --> 01:03:54,061
[gun fires]

1431
01:03:54,063 --> 01:03:55,878
Goddamn, babe. What the fuck?

1432
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:58,118
You know I fucking
