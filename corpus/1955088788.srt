189
00:37:39,739 --> 00:37:44,420
Yes, but I'm not sure? Ana.
This world is full of maniacs.

190
00:37:44,539 --> 00:37:47,220
They say that the good news,
where it is not. OKAY?

191
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,540
It is a dream.

No, I'm not crazy.

212
00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:28,380
I am attached to this place. This may
call emotional bond.

213
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:36,620
But when I'm ready, I'll
left their mark elsewhere.
