1
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:16,250
(woman humming lullaby)

2
00:00:18,086 --> 00:00:22,223
(woman singing)

3
00:01:44,405 --> 00:01:46,640
(woman 1)
You don't think
it was an accident?

4
00:01:46,674 --> 00:01:49,243
(woman 2)
It just doesn't...

5
00:01:49,277 --> 00:01:51,779
something about it doesn't
sit right, you know?

6
00:01:51,812 --> 00:01:53,514
I mean, she knew diving.

7
00:01:53,547 --> 00:01:57,351
She knew that lake
so well.

8
00:01:57,385 --> 00:02:00,454
And she knew no one would
be able to find her in it.

9
00:02:00,488 --> 00:02:03,524
She was dumb to go
diving by herself.

10
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:15,803
(woman 1)
Do you guys think
Mom was reincarnated?

11
00:02:15,836 --> 00:02:19,607
(woman 3)
I don't know. Maybe.

12
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,209
(woman 2)
She told me this story

13
00:02:21,242 --> 00:02:22,810
of, um, the river
of forgetting.

14
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:24,612
Do you guys...
Have you heard that?

15
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,280
(woman 1)
No.

16
00:02:26,314 --> 00:02:29,183
(woman 2)
She said before you're born,

17
00:02:29,217 --> 00:02:32,653
your soul travels across
the river of forgetting,

18
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:36,524
and it just wipes
your memory clean,

19
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:40,861
so that you can go be born
again, into a new life.

20
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:43,897
You just keep doing this
over and over again,

21
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:45,833
lifetime over
lifetime, you know,

22
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:49,503
just the... the cycle
of reincarnation.

23
00:02:50,738 --> 00:02:53,341
And finally once you...
Your soul has learned

24
00:02:53,374 --> 00:02:55,676
everything that it's
supposed to learn,

25
00:02:55,709 --> 00:03:01,549
then you get to travel back
over the river of remembering.

26
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:07,288
And all your
previous selves

27
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:09,990
come together, being one
with everything

28
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:14,962
that has come before,
and is, and will come.

29
00:03:30,378 --> 00:03:34,915
(woman 1)
It's weird to think
that Mom's still down there.

30
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:36,850
(woman 2)
I think it's fitting.

31
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:39,853
She loved the
lake so much.

32
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:42,323
It's where she'd
want to be.

33
00:03:44,592 --> 00:03:47,928
(woman 1)
When was the last
time you were home?

34
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:50,531
(woman 3)
Not since before
I got married.

35
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:53,767
(woman 1)
Didn't you
miss the lake?

36
00:03:53,801 --> 00:03:55,536
(woman 3)
Nope.

37
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:06,246
(woman 1)
Are you okay?

38
00:04:07,415 --> 00:04:09,783
Yeah.

39
00:04:09,817 --> 00:04:11,485
Should we go down?

40
00:04:14,822 --> 00:04:16,490
You go ahead.

41
00:04:18,526 --> 00:04:20,561
Seriously, go ahead.

42
00:04:44,585 --> 00:04:47,321
(waves crashing)

43
00:05:09,477 --> 00:05:11,345
It's cold.

44
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:18,552
(woman 2)
Are you still
afraid of swimming?

45
00:05:18,586 --> 00:05:20,954
(woman 1)
Mmm...

46
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:23,424
I think I probably am.

47
00:05:31,532 --> 00:05:33,066
Is that Josh?

48
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,403
Do you remember
Josh Jasper?

49
00:05:35,436 --> 00:05:36,169
No.
No?

50
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:37,671
Annie was, like,
obsessed with him.

51
00:05:37,705 --> 00:05:39,807
Like, sick obsessed.

52
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,942
Hey, Josh?

53
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:44,478
Are you Josh Jasper?

54
00:05:44,512 --> 00:05:46,547
Yeah, who's that?

55
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:50,818
Uh, we're Annie's
sisters, Isa and June.

56
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:52,152
Annie here?

57
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,887
Yeah, she is.

58
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:56,824
You should come over
for dinner tonight.

59
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,859
Uh, thanks, I got...

60
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:00,494
I got stuff I gotta do,
but thanks.

61
00:06:00,528 --> 00:06:03,831
No, you have to,
she's gonna be so excited.

62
00:06:06,467 --> 00:06:07,735
(Isa)
Yes.

63
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:09,069
(Josh)
So, the home ec teachers...

64
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:10,538
We were making
chocolate freshman year.

65
00:06:10,571 --> 00:06:11,605
Yeah.
For a parfait...

66
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,441
We had to make
parfaits, right?

67
00:06:13,474 --> 00:06:15,809
And Annie, she had to
make chocolate mousse,

68
00:06:15,843 --> 00:06:17,044
and she messed up 'cause
she got the yogurt.

69
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:18,612
And she poured, like,
cinnamon on top,

70
00:06:18,646 --> 00:06:20,748
but the top fell off and
all the cinnamon was like...

71
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:21,882
(Isa laughing)

72
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:23,951
And she got so upset.

73
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:26,587
(muffled conversation
continues)

74
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:33,994
Dinner's ready!

75
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:35,829
Okay, here we go.

76
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:39,433
(Isa laughing)
Sorry it's just pasta.

77
00:06:39,467 --> 00:06:41,835
I didn't realize we would
be entertaining tonight.

78
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:44,071
It looks beautiful.

79
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:47,775
Big camera.

80
00:06:47,808 --> 00:06:49,810
(June laughing)

81
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:51,812
Is it digital,
is it...?

82
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:53,146
(June)
Mm-hmm.

83
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,882
So, we're in your
documentary?

84
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,551
(all laughing)

85
00:06:57,585 --> 00:06:59,787
(June)
Right now you are.

86
00:07:00,721 --> 00:07:02,556
(Josh)
Aren't you gonna eat?

87
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:03,924
(June)
No.

88
00:07:05,593 --> 00:07:07,094
June only eats alone.

89
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:11,465
Mmm, I mean,
you gotta be hungry.

90
00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:12,833
(June)
I said no.

91
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:14,968
She has since
she was little.

92
00:07:15,002 --> 00:07:17,605
It's not really
like a big deal.

93
00:07:17,638 --> 00:07:18,706
Do you want
some more pasta?

94
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:21,141
I eat alone
a lot too, so...

95
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:22,843
Parmesan?
Yeah, please.

96
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:24,645
Yeah.

97
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:26,547
Okay.

98
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:30,718
So, you see how the lines
of your palm are shallow?

99
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:32,119
Mmm.

100
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:35,155
Um, it just means that
you're a young soul.

101
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:38,926
Is that good?

102
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,794
Um, well, it's neither
good or bad.

103
00:07:40,828 --> 00:07:43,063
It's just...
It just means that

104
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:47,234
you have to come back
for more lifetimes...
Oh.

105
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:49,803
To continue learning.

106
00:07:49,837 --> 00:07:51,204
(Isa)
Two kids.

107
00:07:51,238 --> 00:07:52,906
That's true too.

108
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,208
Who'd you have
two kids with?

109
00:07:58,846 --> 00:08:00,681
Remember Molly
from high school?

110
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:01,849
Yeah.

111
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:04,151
Well done,
she was a babe.

112
00:08:06,654 --> 00:08:08,488
Yeah, she was.

113
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,726
We're not
together anymore.

114
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:16,096
Um, sorry to
hear that.

115
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:17,798
Yeah.

116
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:22,169
Yeah, it's been
a rough summer.

117
00:08:24,705 --> 00:08:26,640
That it has.

118
00:08:26,674 --> 00:08:29,577
For all of us.
Mm-hmm.

119
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,144
I wanted to tell
you guys

120
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:34,582
how sorry I am
about your mom.

121
00:08:34,615 --> 00:08:36,850
(Annie and Isa)
Thanks.

122
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:38,686
Yeah, there's a bunch
of us who tried to help,

123
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,520
and, um...

124
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:44,592
you know, by the time
they got some divers,

125
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:47,160
I think it's... you know,
it was just too deep.

126
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:54,001
How'd you hear
about it?

127
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,203
Through the
Sheriff's Department.

128
00:08:56,236 --> 00:09:01,775
Like... five days
after the fact.

129
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:04,612
Guess they had a
hard time finding us.

130
00:09:09,717 --> 00:09:13,987
So, are you... you guys here
for a memorial, or what?

131
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:15,355
No.
No, no.

132
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:20,127
She was clear she didn't
want that kind of thing.

133
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,863
We're just here to, you know,
figure out the next step

134
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,933
and take care of
some affairs.

135
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:29,169
Mmm.

136
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:31,772
(Isa)
The, like, coming back home

137
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:33,774
is... is the part

138
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:38,045
that makes you feel,
like, so strange.

139
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:41,715
It's... it's like
this lake has a power.

140
00:09:41,749 --> 00:09:44,284
I can't explain it,
it's like a draw.

141
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:47,387
(Josh)
You know, no one's
ever found the bottom.

142
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,158
It's pretty strange.

143
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:53,861
(June)
Remember that story
that Mom used to tell us?

144
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:56,196
The one about the
seven sisters?

145
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:56,964
(Isa)
Yeah.

146
00:09:56,997 --> 00:09:59,132
Do you remember?
I do, I do, I do.

147
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,068
So, like, what...

148
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,871
So, the first sister
jumps in, and...

149
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:05,906
Mm-hmm?
She never resurfaces.

150
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,908
So, then the second
sister jumps in

151
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,778
to try and save her,
but she gets pulled down.

152
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:12,012
Then the third sister
jumps in,

153
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:14,882
tries to save that sister,
same thing happens.

154
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:16,684
And one by one,
they all jump in

155
00:10:16,717 --> 00:10:18,151
trying to save each other,
and drown.

156
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:22,255
The legend of the story
is that you can...

157
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,191
go out at midnight

158
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:27,895
and summon up the spirit
of the seventh sister.

159
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:31,765
There have been people
who have seen her

160
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:34,301
but, if you go swimming...

161
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:41,775
there has been talk that it
may be the last time you swim.

162
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:45,312
Oh, God,
it's so crazy.

163
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:46,747
Ooh.

164
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,849
What time is it?
(Isa laughing)

165
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:50,117
(Annie)
Okay, so what do
we have to do

166
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,185
to conjure the
seventh sister?

167
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:54,421
First of all you have...
You have to be very quiet.

168
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:56,890
No, no, you have to
speak from the heart.

169
00:10:56,924 --> 00:10:58,158
Speak from the heart.

170
00:10:58,191 --> 00:10:59,359
From the heart.
And be sincere.

171
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:01,795
In order for the seventh
sister to arise

172
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:03,897
and show herself,
you have to say

173
00:11:03,931 --> 00:11:06,734
"seventh sister"
seven... seven times.

174
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:07,768
Seventh sister,
seventh Sister...

175
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:09,737
No, no, no.
Not now!

176
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:10,904
(girls laughing)
Shh, shh.

177
00:11:10,938 --> 00:11:12,706
You can't do it now.
Sorry.

178
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,775
Because she's going to hear it
and nothing is going to happen.

179
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:15,876
(whispering)
Guys, guys, wait, wait.

180
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:18,812
What? What?
Wait. Wait.

181
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:21,148
I think we
need candles.

182
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:21,815
Yes.

183
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:23,283
(June)
Yeah, definitely.

184
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:23,984
Yeah.

185
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,819
I think Mom
would have some.

186
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:27,955
She has a whole bunch
of them in the basement.

187
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:30,123
Okay, okay,
I'll be right back.

188
00:11:30,157 --> 00:11:32,225
Okay.
Do you want me
to come with you?

189
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:33,927
Hurry.

190
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:43,036
(June)
Is everybody ready?

191
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,271
(Annie)
Yes.

192
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:48,175
Okay, Is, tell it
to the camera.

193
00:11:50,177 --> 00:11:52,913
With the
permission of fire

194
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:56,183
and the permission
of matter,

195
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,752
we now begin.

196
00:11:58,786 --> 00:12:01,789
(women chanting)
Seventh sister,

197
00:12:01,822 --> 00:12:04,925
seventh sister,

198
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,995
seventh sister,

199
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:10,764
seventh sister,

200
00:12:10,798 --> 00:12:13,400
seventh sister,

201
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:15,969
seventh sister,

202
00:12:16,003 --> 00:12:18,471
seventh sister.

203
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:28,315
(Annie)
Did you hear that?

204
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:29,883
(June)
What?
I heard something.

205
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:31,551
(loud splash)

206
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,987
(laughing)

207
00:12:34,021 --> 00:12:35,388
(June)
Why'd you do that?

208
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:37,390
It's not...
It was him!

209
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:38,992
(laughing)

210
00:12:39,026 --> 00:12:40,427
Well, that was a
disappointment.
Oh, well.

211
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,162
(Annie laughing)
Oh, well.

212
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:43,430
(Josh)
I'll have to tell
you the story

213
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:44,898
about the seven
brothers next.

214
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:45,933
Oh, God.

215
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:47,467
(all laughing)

216
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:12,125
(June)
Spirit of the seventh sister...

217
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:14,294
(whispering)
I invoke thee.

218
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,172
Did you hear that?

219
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:26,840
(June)
Yeah.

220
00:13:26,874 --> 00:13:28,341
What was that?

221
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,210
I don't know.

222
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:45,625
(stair creaks)

223
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,360
Shh.

224
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:27,034
(laughing)

225
00:14:28,969 --> 00:14:31,138
(bang,
gasping)

226
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:36,609
Should we go upstairs?

227
00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:38,478
No.

228
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:53,626
Do you see
anything?

229
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,929
No.

230
00:14:55,963 --> 00:14:57,998
Get the door.

231
00:14:58,031 --> 00:15:00,300
(wind blowing)

232
00:15:08,175 --> 00:15:11,478
(Isa)
What kind of bird
do you think it is?

233
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:14,014
(June)
I don't know.

234
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:17,584
It's got that
orange belly.

235
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:21,121
And a pointy nose.

236
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:24,491
Maybe it's a
woodpecker.

237
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:25,725
(Annie)
Guys, what are you doing?

238
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,694
It's the middle
of the night.

239
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:30,597
What is that?

240
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,632
It flew into
the window.

241
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,734
Do birds even
fly at night?

242
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,436
What is he doing
in the kitchen?

243
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:39,606
How did you
get him in here?

244
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:41,108
It's a wild animal.

245
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:46,213
They have diseases,
guys.

246
00:15:46,246 --> 00:15:47,480
It's unsanitary.

247
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:49,049
Isa,
don't touch it!

248
00:15:49,082 --> 00:15:52,185
Isa, don't touch it.
Okay, okay.

249
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:58,425
I want to give it
a proper burial.

250
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,060
Honey, let's just
take him outside, okay?

251
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:01,294
Please don't put
it in the trash.

252
00:16:01,328 --> 00:16:02,762
We're not keeping
him inside right now.

253
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:05,298
It's the middle of
the night, okay?

254
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,240
Annie hates funerals.

255
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,601
(waves crashing)

256
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:16,303
Here we go.
(Isa)
Yeah.

257
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,774
I don't know if
I wanna see this.

258
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:23,810
Yeah!
This is so embarrassing.

259
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:25,612
(singing)
Join me,

260
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:28,315
in standing up to greed,

261
00:17:28,348 --> 00:17:31,418
(both singing)
and diving into blue.

262
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:41,128
(music playing)

263
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:44,864
(woman)
Though inland far we be,

264
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:48,535
our souls have sight of
that immortal sea

265
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:51,238
which brought us hither.

266
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:58,478
That was
William Wordsworth.

267
00:17:58,511 --> 00:18:02,215
Hello, I am
Dr. Amelia Brooks

268
00:18:02,249 --> 00:18:04,484
and I am the founder
and president

269
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:07,854
of the Blue Water
Conservation Society.

270
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:14,827
If you love our beautiful
blue lake as much as I do,

271
00:18:14,861 --> 00:18:18,431
please, vote yes
on measure "F".

272
00:18:18,465 --> 00:18:22,869
Join me in
standing up to greed

273
00:18:22,902 --> 00:18:26,139
and diving into blue.

274
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:39,552
(chuckles)

275
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:06,413
(dialing phone number)

276
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:33,506
Hi, may I please speak
to Dr. Amelia Brooks?

277
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:42,315
Oh, well, do you know
when she might be back?

278
00:19:49,556 --> 00:19:51,391
Oh, no, I didn't.

279
00:19:53,326 --> 00:19:54,561
Oh.

280
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,499
Oh, I'm so sorry.

281
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:04,871
I'm very sorry
for your loss.

282
00:20:07,274 --> 00:20:09,509
No, thank you.
Bye.

283
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:25,792
(woman)
These are the comparables
that are in your neighborhood

284
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:27,394
that the appraiser
was working off of.

285
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:29,496
You might wanna take
a peek at those.

286
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:30,930
Okay.
And then um... oh!

287
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:32,699
Will we do a...
Who's this?

288
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:34,667
Oh, this is
our sister June.

289
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:36,903
Oh!
Are you a photographer?

290
00:20:36,936 --> 00:20:38,305
(June)
Mm-hmm.

291
00:20:38,338 --> 00:20:40,473
(Annie)
She's our family archivist.

292
00:20:40,507 --> 00:20:41,841
That's neat.

293
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:45,512
Um, will we have
to do photographs

294
00:20:45,545 --> 00:20:47,447
for our own comp card
or is that something

295
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,915
that your agency does?

296
00:20:48,948 --> 00:20:52,319
Oh, um... definitely have
a phenomenal photographer

297
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:53,586
that will come
out and, uh, take...

298
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,687
I have a question, though.

299
00:20:54,721 --> 00:20:56,389
How is this like
a comparable

300
00:20:56,423 --> 00:21:00,793
if it's not on
the water, and...?

301
00:21:00,827 --> 00:21:02,662
Well, because
this is actually...

302
00:21:02,695 --> 00:21:04,063
You know,
it's a newer home,

303
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,832
but because it's
not on the water,

304
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:07,500
it's not gonna have
the same price.

305
00:21:07,534 --> 00:21:09,936
And due to the fact that
this is an older home

306
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:11,638
and it has a
lot of issues...

307
00:21:11,671 --> 00:21:13,373
So they kinda of equal
each other out.

308
00:21:13,406 --> 00:21:14,173
Yeah.
Okay.

309
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:15,942
Are you recording
that right now?

310
00:21:15,975 --> 00:21:18,711
Um, sorry.
It's not gonna be...

311
00:21:18,745 --> 00:21:20,079
She's just doing
a documentary.

312
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,382
A documentary?
Okay.

313
00:21:22,415 --> 00:21:25,752
Um, okay, now my other
question is, um,

314
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:28,020
do we have to
fix the roofing

315
00:21:28,054 --> 00:21:30,857
and the electrical problems
that the appraisers found,

316
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:33,626
or can we just do a
faster, as-is sale?

317
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,928
You know I think it's
really gonna be up to you.

318
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:37,430
Okay.
I have to be honest...

319
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:38,931
You know, if you wanna
make that investment,

320
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:40,467
but I don't think you do.
Right.

321
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,801
And I'm gonna
tell you right now,

322
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:43,436
they're probably
just gonna bust

323
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:44,671
the house down anyways.

324
00:21:44,704 --> 00:21:45,938
They're really
buying this house

325
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:49,442
for the property itself.
Does this have to be on?

326
00:21:49,476 --> 00:21:51,478
If we have the
open house...
Yeah.

327
00:21:51,511 --> 00:21:52,945
And someone is interested
in buying it,

328
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:54,447
Sure.
But then as we talk

329
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:55,815
we decide we don't
wanna sell,

330
00:21:55,848 --> 00:21:56,949
like, that's fine,
right? Because...

331
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:58,084
Well, we do want to sell.

332
00:21:58,117 --> 00:21:59,652
Well...
(sighs)

333
00:21:59,686 --> 00:22:01,020
No, I think that...

334
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:02,922
It's too much of a
financial responsibility

335
00:22:02,955 --> 00:22:04,991
to put... you know,
having to fix the roof

336
00:22:05,024 --> 00:22:06,092
and pay the
property taxes

337
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:07,427
and bring the electrical
up to code.

338
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,995
Well, what if
there was a way

339
00:22:09,028 --> 00:22:10,963
to turn it into some
sort of rental unit or...

340
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:12,732
But then who's gonna run
the rental property?

341
00:22:12,765 --> 00:22:13,966
That's a lot of
responsibility

342
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,902
and I know that
I cannot take that on.

343
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:17,404
You wouldn't wanna
take that on.

344
00:22:17,437 --> 00:22:18,538
No, and I think...

345
00:22:18,571 --> 00:22:21,941
I guess what
I'm hearing

346
00:22:21,974 --> 00:22:25,144
is that you've
already decided,

347
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,914
and this is only
one-third yours.

348
00:22:27,947 --> 00:22:29,382
I don't think
I should be here.

349
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:30,950
I think that you need to
have this conversation...

350
00:22:30,983 --> 00:22:32,685
I'm sorry,
I don't mean to make
it uncomfortable for you.

351
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:34,521
It's okay.
We'll discuss.

352
00:22:34,554 --> 00:22:36,756
I think you need to get on
the same page because...

353
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:38,157
Yes.
You don't want anyone

354
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,059
walking in this door and
you're not ready to sell.

355
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:41,628
Right.
I'll walk you out.

356
00:22:41,661 --> 00:22:42,762
All right,
sounds good.

357
00:22:42,795 --> 00:22:44,130
Difficult
decision for her.

358
00:22:44,163 --> 00:22:46,399
I understand, but I gotta
tell you right now...

359
00:22:46,433 --> 00:22:49,836
If my dad were to
give me a loan,

360
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:53,172
then... I could fix

361
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:56,175
the roof and...

362
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,944
the other things,
and then...

363
00:22:57,977 --> 00:22:59,612
(Annie)
And then what?

364
00:22:59,646 --> 00:23:01,814
Well, that's the thing...
I was talking to June before,

365
00:23:01,848 --> 00:23:05,117
and it was like,
we could, um...

366
00:23:05,151 --> 00:23:09,055
like, rent it out for
different things.

367
00:23:09,088 --> 00:23:12,759
You know, like there's,
like, so many yoga schools

368
00:23:12,792 --> 00:23:15,061
that rent out places
to do retreats,

369
00:23:15,094 --> 00:23:17,797
and, like, art programs
and just...

370
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,732
I mean, what do
you think, June?

371
00:23:19,766 --> 00:23:21,468
Do you...?

372
00:23:23,002 --> 00:23:25,438
What do you
wanna do, Junie?

373
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:30,743
(June)
I don't really feel
like it's my decision.

374
00:23:30,777 --> 00:23:34,113
I mean, it's Mom's house.

375
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:36,583
(humming)

376
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,955
(laughing)

377
00:23:42,989 --> 00:23:44,090
Aah!

378
00:23:44,123 --> 00:23:48,094
(laughing)

379
00:23:48,127 --> 00:23:49,796
Uhh!

380
00:23:49,829 --> 00:23:52,699
Annie, come in!

381
00:23:52,732 --> 00:23:54,667
No way.
It's too cold.

382
00:23:54,701 --> 00:23:56,202
No, it warms up...

383
00:23:56,235 --> 00:23:59,138
once you're in it for
like a few seconds.

384
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,743
Once you're in there,
for a few seconds...

385
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:06,012
(laughing)
No!

386
00:24:06,045 --> 00:24:07,079
Come on,
grab her feet.

387
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:08,915
No! No!
Let's go!

388
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:11,217
Wait, we're gonna make
her drink first.

389
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:12,919
(laughing)

390
00:24:14,253 --> 00:24:16,956
(singing)
Miss Spirit Lake!

391
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:19,058
Welcome back,
ladies and gentleman

392
00:24:19,091 --> 00:24:21,594
to the Little Miss
Spirit Lake competition.

393
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:24,964
We've now moved on to the
swimsuit portion of the evening.

394
00:24:24,997 --> 00:24:26,966
Now, you may be confused,
you may think

395
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:29,068
that this is
a swimsuit, but it's not.

396
00:24:29,101 --> 00:24:31,571
However... it doesn't
really matter,

397
00:24:31,604 --> 00:24:33,606
'cause guess who's
gonna be nice and warm

398
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,510
and dry and cozy on the
way home, unlike...

399
00:24:37,544 --> 00:24:39,946
these two right here.

400
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:42,248
You should be
drunk every day.

401
00:24:42,281 --> 00:24:45,184
I am.
Wait, I felt something.

402
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:46,619
What?

403
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:48,054
Come on.

404
00:24:48,087 --> 00:24:50,657
Seriously, I felt
something touch my foot.

405
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:53,125
(mocking)
Seriously, I felt
something touch my foot.

406
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:56,095
It was so scary.
It was so scary.

407
00:24:56,128 --> 00:24:57,630
(Isa and Josh scream)

408
00:24:58,665 --> 00:24:59,999
Is?

409
00:25:01,634 --> 00:25:03,035
(June)
Isa?

410
00:25:07,774 --> 00:25:09,241
Isa?

411
00:25:10,577 --> 00:25:11,644
Isa!

412
00:25:11,678 --> 00:25:12,845
(June)
Oh, my God!

413
00:25:12,879 --> 00:25:15,582
(panicked breathing)

414
00:25:15,615 --> 00:25:17,984
(laughing)

415
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:20,753
I'm sorry!
It was...

416
00:25:20,787 --> 00:25:22,154
(Annie)
Screw you.
No, no.

417
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:22,922
It's not funny!

418
00:25:22,955 --> 00:25:24,657
Annie, it was a joke.
Whatever.

419
00:25:24,691 --> 00:25:26,859
Oh, come on, Annie!

420
00:25:26,893 --> 00:25:28,127
Geez.

421
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,897
Annie, I'm sorry,
it was just a joke.

422
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:39,071
(Josh)
Annie, come on!

423
00:25:42,174 --> 00:25:44,310
Annie!

424
00:25:44,343 --> 00:25:45,845
My leg!
(chuckles)

425
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:47,614
It's not funny.

426
00:25:51,017 --> 00:25:52,719
(June)
That wasn't
too funny, you guys.

427
00:25:52,752 --> 00:25:53,820
(Josh)
Huh?

428
00:25:53,853 --> 00:25:55,321
That wasn't very funny.

429
00:25:55,354 --> 00:25:57,256
Oh, come on.

430
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:02,729
You coming in?

431
00:26:02,762 --> 00:26:04,296
No.
Come on.

432
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:11,604
(June)
You okay, Annie?

433
00:26:11,638 --> 00:26:13,005
I'm fine.

434
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:16,042
I can't do the camera
right now, June. Sorry.

435
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:41,333
(humming)

436
00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:48,240
(humming continues)

437
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:57,650
(Isa)
He's a good person, you know?

438
00:26:59,886 --> 00:27:03,289
He's kind of
different than...

439
00:27:03,322 --> 00:27:08,027
the normal kind of guy
I'm attracted to usually.

440
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,997
(June)
I think he really likes you.

441
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:18,137
Yeah, I think that he...

442
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:23,375
the way that he
likes people...

443
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:27,346
would be really good for me.

444
00:27:28,815 --> 00:27:30,249
(sighs)

445
00:27:42,228 --> 00:27:44,764
(Isa)
Okay, now I'm ready.

446
00:27:44,797 --> 00:27:47,033
So, tell me from
the beginning.

447
00:27:47,066 --> 00:27:51,437
Um, okay, so, uh,
there were seven sisters,

448
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:54,874
and they were walking
in a field with their mother,

449
00:27:54,907 --> 00:27:56,876
and Orion saw them
walking through the field,

450
00:27:56,909 --> 00:27:59,011
and he fell madly in
love with them,

451
00:27:59,045 --> 00:28:01,180
and he pursued them.

452
00:28:01,213 --> 00:28:03,783
He chased them everywhere
for years and years.

453
00:28:03,816 --> 00:28:05,852
And finally,
after seven years,

454
00:28:05,885 --> 00:28:09,021
Zeus answered their...
Their prayers,

455
00:28:09,055 --> 00:28:12,992
and he turned them into birds
so they could fly away.

456
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:15,027
And they flew up
into the sky,

457
00:28:15,061 --> 00:28:16,996
and then they
became stars.

458
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:18,397
They became
the Pleiades.

459
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:21,167
Okay, but tell me...
Tell me the weird part.

460
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,137
Okay, the weird part
is that...

461
00:28:27,173 --> 00:28:30,743
there... there are
seven sisters,

462
00:28:30,777 --> 00:28:33,746
but there are
actually only six stars

463
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,882
that are visible to
the naked eye.

464
00:28:35,915 --> 00:28:40,853
And in spite of that,
in almost every culture,

465
00:28:40,887 --> 00:28:43,022
the constellation is called
the seven sisters.

466
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:45,024
So, there's this
seventh star

467
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:48,160
that everybody seems to know
is there and it is there,

468
00:28:48,194 --> 00:28:50,897
but it's completely
invisible.

469
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:53,933
And I just think
that's really interesting.

470
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:09,148
Shh.

471
00:30:03,435 --> 00:30:04,937
(Annie)
June?

472
00:30:04,971 --> 00:30:07,473
(Isa)
June?

473
00:30:07,506 --> 00:30:09,008
(Annie)
June!

474
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:14,513
(June)
I'm over here!

475
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:17,449
(Annie)
Oh, God, oh...

476
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:19,986
Jesus Christ, June,
you really scared me.

477
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:21,187
Why?
What'd I do?

478
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,454
Well, I heard a noise
and woke up

479
00:30:22,488 --> 00:30:23,856
but you weren't there.

480
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:25,524
What are you even
doing out here?

481
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:27,493
I wanted to
go swimming.

482
00:30:27,526 --> 00:30:30,262
In the middle
of the night?

483
00:30:30,296 --> 00:30:33,132
Please don't do
this to me again.

484
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:38,470
We found another bird.

485
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:46,245
(Isa)
Don't you think it's
a little strange

486
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:48,247
that this is the
second night in a row

487
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,482
that it's happened?

488
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:53,385
(Annie)
Maybe it's the
change in weather.

489
00:30:53,419 --> 00:30:55,955
They just got confused.

490
00:30:57,556 --> 00:30:59,258
Yeah, but birds
fly south.

491
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:02,161
They just don't
fall out of the sky.

492
00:31:06,432 --> 00:31:10,569
(June)
You don't think that Josh
would be doing this, do you?

493
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:12,371
No.
No.

494
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,476
I'm sorry I scared
you guys.

495
00:31:21,013 --> 00:31:24,250
Josh, you didn't leave
the birds, did you?

496
00:31:24,283 --> 00:31:25,417
No.

497
00:31:25,451 --> 00:31:26,919
Are you sure?

498
00:31:26,953 --> 00:31:28,487
Yeah, I'm sure.

499
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,456
I thought you might be
trying to scare us

500
00:31:30,489 --> 00:31:33,059
'cause of the whole
seven sisters thing?

501
00:31:33,092 --> 00:31:34,460
No.

502
00:31:37,563 --> 00:31:39,198
(Isa)
It's just totally
disrespectful,

503
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:43,202
Annie just put
them in the trash.

504
00:31:45,104 --> 00:31:46,605
(Josh)
Certain time of the day

505
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:48,240
that my dad calls
the change over.

506
00:31:48,274 --> 00:31:52,011
It's right when the
sun is about to set.

507
00:31:52,044 --> 00:31:55,214
Everything goes silent.

508
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:59,318
All the waves in the lake
just kind of stop.

509
00:31:59,351 --> 00:32:01,520
It only happens on this lake,
and I've been to a lot...

510
00:32:01,553 --> 00:32:03,122
Really?
I've never noticed that.

511
00:32:03,155 --> 00:32:05,457
Wait, you got one!
Okay, what do I do?

512
00:32:05,491 --> 00:32:06,725
What do I do?
Adjust the drag.

513
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,194
Right here, right here.
Yeah, okay.

514
00:32:08,227 --> 00:32:09,395
June, you gotta
back up, June...
Ow!

515
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:10,129
Back up June!

516
00:32:10,162 --> 00:32:11,630
All right, get up,
get it up.

517
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:13,599
(laughs)
Stand up.

518
00:32:13,632 --> 00:32:15,034
Reel it in.
Okay, okay.

519
00:32:15,067 --> 00:32:16,735
It feels... ah!
You got it, you got it!

520
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,437
Feels really heavy.
It's coming.

521
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:19,972
Oh! What?
Wow.

522
00:32:20,006 --> 00:32:21,473
What is that?

523
00:32:21,507 --> 00:32:23,575
It's definitely
not a fish.

524
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:27,446
No, that is...
it's a red fish.

525
00:32:27,479 --> 00:32:28,647
Yeah right,
yeah, you do it.

526
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,550
I got it, I got it.

527
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:33,552
This is your first...
First catch?

528
00:32:33,585 --> 00:32:35,221
(laughing)
Yeah.

529
00:32:35,254 --> 00:32:37,256
And it's...

530
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:41,460
Here, June.

531
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:54,506
I like this way better
than a fish.

532
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,009
(Josh)
You guys wanna get going?

533
00:32:57,043 --> 00:33:01,480
Um, kinda wanna ride
the roller coaster.

534
00:33:01,513 --> 00:33:05,184
The roller coaster's been
closed since Labor Day.

535
00:33:05,217 --> 00:33:06,318
I know.

536
00:33:07,386 --> 00:33:08,387
(Josh)
Come on.

537
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,156
You can do it.
I'll catch you.

538
00:33:10,189 --> 00:33:13,625
Here, take that.
Put it over there.

539
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:15,761
You're so bossy.
(laughing)

540
00:33:15,794 --> 00:33:17,229
I'm not bossy.
"Put it over there!"

541
00:33:17,263 --> 00:33:18,664
"Here, take this.
Put it over there!"

542
00:33:18,697 --> 00:33:20,066
(laughing)

543
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:21,233
All right,
you ready to catch me?

544
00:33:21,267 --> 00:33:23,269
Yeah, I'll catch you.
Good.

545
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:31,477
(Isa humming)

546
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:40,519
(laughing)

547
00:33:43,789 --> 00:33:45,757
(continues humming)

548
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:56,135
I feel like the lake
gave this to me.

549
00:33:59,271 --> 00:34:00,839
(June)
I want one.

550
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:05,311
Well... you chose
not to fish.

551
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:11,517
You have to throw your
line in to catch something.

552
00:34:22,128 --> 00:34:24,663
Annie?

553
00:34:24,696 --> 00:34:26,398
(Josh)
Is she here?
Look.

554
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:28,100
Oh, here she is.
Wow.

555
00:34:28,134 --> 00:34:29,535
How are you?
Hey, Annie!

556
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:31,237
You guys were fishing?

557
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:32,504
(Josh)
Yeah, we didn't
catch anything.

558
00:34:32,538 --> 00:34:34,173
(Isa)
Yeah, we didn't
really catch anything.

559
00:34:34,206 --> 00:34:35,574
We were just trying to...

560
00:34:35,607 --> 00:34:37,109
(Isa and Josh laugh)

561
00:34:37,143 --> 00:34:38,210
Well, I didn't
realize that you guys

562
00:34:38,244 --> 00:34:39,378
had a fishing trip
planned,

563
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:41,780
so I was, um,
just gonna do

564
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:43,515
like a sisters' breakfast,

565
00:34:43,549 --> 00:34:45,651
because we haven't really
had a chance to talk.

566
00:34:45,684 --> 00:34:48,320
But if you'd like to stay,
I can set a place for you.

567
00:34:48,354 --> 00:34:49,821
No I got... I got stuff
to do. That's fine.

568
00:34:49,855 --> 00:34:51,123
You sure?
Yeah.

569
00:34:51,157 --> 00:34:52,491
(Isa)
Yeah.
Yeah.

570
00:34:52,524 --> 00:34:54,226
See you later.

571
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,262
Bye, June.

572
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,436
Um, I was
actually thinking

573
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:08,707
that maybe we could do like
a full sisters' day today.

574
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,775
Take a break from...

575
00:35:09,808 --> 00:35:11,577
Like a half-sisters' day.

576
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,579
What?

577
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:15,914
Like a
half-sisters' day.

578
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:19,818
It was just a joke, 'cause you
said like a full sisters' day.

579
00:35:26,492 --> 00:35:27,693
Go on.

580
00:35:27,726 --> 00:35:29,861
Um, I don't know.

581
00:35:29,895 --> 00:35:32,298
I was thinking I could maybe
take you guys shopping

582
00:35:32,331 --> 00:35:37,403
and we could get some
manicures and pedicures.

583
00:35:40,339 --> 00:35:43,342
We could go out
for lunch.

584
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:44,843
(sighs)

585
00:35:47,513 --> 00:35:49,648
I mean, that's a big part
of this trip for me,

586
00:35:49,681 --> 00:35:51,950
is spending time
with you guys.

587
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:55,521
So, I just thought
that it would be fun.

588
00:35:55,554 --> 00:35:57,789
I mean, we don't have to.
We can stay here.

589
00:35:57,823 --> 00:35:59,825
Or you can...

590
00:35:59,858 --> 00:36:01,793
you know, hang out
with Josh or whatever.

591
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:04,396
(scoffs)
No, it...

592
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:06,432
No, it's not like I wanna
hang out with Josh

593
00:36:06,465 --> 00:36:07,966
over you guys.
I just think it's funny

594
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,868
that all of a sudden,
you're, like,

595
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:13,372
all, like, about family,
and... spending time...

596
00:36:13,405 --> 00:36:15,274
All of a sudden,
like all about family?

597
00:36:15,307 --> 00:36:17,909
Yeah, all of
a sudden. I mean...

598
00:36:19,278 --> 00:36:21,380
This is like the first
time you've been home in...

599
00:36:21,413 --> 00:36:24,750
In like over ten years...
You said it yourself.

600
00:36:24,783 --> 00:36:26,585
So, it's just
funny that...

601
00:36:26,618 --> 00:36:29,488
That doesn't mean that
I don't care about you,

602
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:31,357
and that I haven't made
a lot of efforts.

603
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:33,725
I've invited you to
Chicago so many times.

604
00:36:33,759 --> 00:36:34,793
No, I know, it's...

605
00:36:34,826 --> 00:36:36,262
And you've each
come once.

606
00:36:36,295 --> 00:36:38,397
One time.

607
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,999
It's more like...

608
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:45,203
I don't think you're,
like, aware of how hard...

609
00:36:46,505 --> 00:36:48,374
(sighs)

610
00:36:58,317 --> 00:36:59,985
I just... I don't
think you're aware

611
00:37:00,018 --> 00:37:02,688
of hard it was for Mom...
(scoffs)

612
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:06,792
to not have, like,
reconciled with you.

613
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:12,831
Well...

614
00:37:12,864 --> 00:37:18,270
that is...
Mom's cross to bear.

615
00:37:18,304 --> 00:37:21,407
Well,
but it's yours too.

616
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,808
She wanted so badly

617
00:37:22,841 --> 00:37:24,810
to just have everything
be okay with you,

618
00:37:24,843 --> 00:37:28,013
(laughs)
to the point where, like...

619
00:37:28,046 --> 00:37:30,416
Go look in
that bedroom.

620
00:37:30,449 --> 00:37:32,551
She brought the crib up
and, like, put toys in it.

621
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:34,052
She was so excited that you
were gonna have a baby...

622
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,787
That has nothing
to do with me.

623
00:37:35,821 --> 00:37:37,389
Yeah it does, it does.
The crib had
nothing to do with me.

624
00:37:37,423 --> 00:37:39,925
It was like a chance
to reconnect with you,

625
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:43,695
for you to be a mother and,
like, know what it's like.

626
00:37:43,729 --> 00:37:46,632
When I called her to tell
her that I was pregnant,

627
00:37:46,665 --> 00:37:50,469
she barely
acknowledged that.

628
00:37:50,502 --> 00:37:52,738
She immediately started
talking about

629
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:54,773
something to do with
the lake, and, like,

630
00:37:54,806 --> 00:37:58,710
it was like,
"Oh, that's nice honey."

631
00:37:58,744 --> 00:38:00,646
She didn't care.

632
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:02,714
No, she... she did care.

633
00:38:02,748 --> 00:38:05,484
I mean, she set
the crib up herself,

634
00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:07,753
and she brought out...
Out all of our toys,

635
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:11,590
and, you know...

636
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:13,959
Well, I'm sorry that my
miscarriage was so selfish,

637
00:38:13,992 --> 00:38:17,363
so inconvenient for her.

638
00:38:17,396 --> 00:38:18,930
(Annie)
God, I don't know
what I was thinking.

639
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:20,566
(Isa)
Annie, that's not what
I'm talking about.

640
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:21,900
She made it about her

641
00:38:21,933 --> 00:38:24,436
just like she made
everything about her.

642
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:54,800
(boat motor running)

643
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,451
(Isa)
And um, well,
it's basically the idea

644
00:39:12,484 --> 00:39:15,787
of before you're born,
your soul has to cross

645
00:39:15,821 --> 00:39:17,989
over the river of forgetting.

646
00:39:18,023 --> 00:39:21,460
And that sort of wipes
its memory clean

647
00:39:21,493 --> 00:39:23,962
of the life it had
just lived, so you can go

648
00:39:23,995 --> 00:39:25,764
into the next one.
(Josh)
Hmm.

649
00:39:25,797 --> 00:39:29,100
And it just keeps happening,
you know, at the end of life,

650
00:39:29,134 --> 00:39:30,936
just over and over again,

651
00:39:30,969 --> 00:39:33,371
different cycles
of reincarnation.

652
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:39,077
There's something
very comforting

653
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:42,714
about knowing you've
already learned things

654
00:39:42,748 --> 00:39:44,950
and had just forgotten them.
Huh.

655
00:39:44,983 --> 00:39:48,520
Like, you just don't
know how to see them.

656
00:39:48,554 --> 00:39:50,822
Yeah, I know
what you mean.

657
00:39:50,856 --> 00:39:53,825
I think if we could remember

658
00:39:53,859 --> 00:39:58,664
our past lives when we
were first babies,

659
00:39:58,697 --> 00:40:00,799
we might not want to live.

660
00:40:07,706 --> 00:40:09,475
(wind blowing)

661
00:40:15,514 --> 00:40:18,750
Haven't been to Mom's lab
since I was little.

662
00:40:18,784 --> 00:40:20,952
(June)
Me neither.

663
00:40:20,986 --> 00:40:23,822
We should go.

664
00:40:23,855 --> 00:40:26,024
These are Amelia's
daughters... they're here

665
00:40:26,057 --> 00:40:27,626
to look at some of their
mother's things.

666
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:29,828
Hey, welcome,
come on in.

667
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:36,535
And this was her desk.

668
00:40:38,236 --> 00:40:41,006
I'll be in the other room
if you need anything.

669
00:40:52,884 --> 00:40:55,721
(June)
Oh, my God. Isa!

670
00:40:55,754 --> 00:40:58,790
It's the seven sisters.

671
00:40:58,824 --> 00:41:00,592
(Isa)
That's so weird.

672
00:41:02,994 --> 00:41:05,230
Do you remember how
Mom used to say

673
00:41:05,263 --> 00:41:07,065
when she was going
deep water diving,

674
00:41:07,098 --> 00:41:10,235
that she was going
for a space walk?

675
00:41:10,268 --> 00:41:12,804
Did she really
used to say that?

676
00:41:12,838 --> 00:41:14,472
Yeah.

677
00:41:16,007 --> 00:41:17,976
Hmm.

678
00:41:18,009 --> 00:41:19,511
This is the lake.

679
00:41:19,545 --> 00:41:20,612
Hmm.

680
00:41:20,646 --> 00:41:23,982
"August 18th,
170 feet.

681
00:41:24,015 --> 00:41:25,851
Fear, sadness."

682
00:41:25,884 --> 00:41:28,554
"August 25th,
190 feet.

683
00:41:28,587 --> 00:41:31,122
Sadness,
nostalgia."

684
00:41:35,126 --> 00:41:39,865
"August 31st,
200 feet."

685
00:41:39,898 --> 00:41:42,968
She wrote
"Fear subsides."

686
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:46,538
"Deep samples
resemble...

687
00:41:47,739 --> 00:41:50,909
amniotic fluid?"

688
00:41:50,942 --> 00:41:52,143
(Josh)
What's in the fridge?

689
00:41:52,177 --> 00:41:55,113
Oh, that's where we
keep our samples.

690
00:41:55,146 --> 00:41:57,749
(Isa)
I wonder if
they still have

691
00:41:57,783 --> 00:42:00,151
some of Mom's
samples in there.

692
00:42:40,659 --> 00:42:43,294
(June chuckling)

693
00:43:51,763 --> 00:43:54,032
(baby mobile playing)

694
00:44:10,315 --> 00:44:12,784
(Annie)
I don't think
she was excited.

695
00:44:12,818 --> 00:44:15,320
(baby mobile continues playing)

696
00:44:15,353 --> 00:44:18,356
I think she was just
trying to prove a point.

697
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:21,092
(June)
What point was she
trying to prove?

698
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:26,765
Same point she was
trying to prove

699
00:44:26,798 --> 00:44:30,702
every time
she had a baby.

700
00:44:30,736 --> 00:44:33,438
This was just
another baby.

701
00:45:27,192 --> 00:45:30,428
* There's a land that I see

702
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:33,899
* Where the children
are free *

703
00:45:33,932 --> 00:45:36,902
* And I say it ain't far

704
00:45:36,935 --> 00:45:39,938
* To this land
from where we are *

705
00:45:39,971 --> 00:45:43,008
* Take my hand
come with me *

706
00:45:43,041 --> 00:45:46,144
* Where the children are free

707
00:45:46,177 --> 00:45:49,347
* Come with me
take my hand *

708
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:52,283
* And we'll live

709
00:45:52,317 --> 00:45:55,286
* In a land where the
river runs free *

710
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:58,556
* In a land through
the green country *

711
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:01,292
* In a land to a shining sea

712
00:46:01,326 --> 00:46:04,963
* And you and me
are free to be *

713
00:46:04,996 --> 00:46:07,332
* You and me

714
00:46:10,936 --> 00:46:14,239
* Every boy in this land

715
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:17,208
* Grows to be
his own man *

716
00:46:17,242 --> 00:46:20,278
* In this land
every girl *

717
00:46:20,311 --> 00:46:23,414
* Grows to be her own woman

718
00:46:23,448 --> 00:46:26,818
* Take my hand
come with me *

719
00:46:26,852 --> 00:46:29,888
* Where the children are free

720
00:46:29,921 --> 00:46:32,924
* Come with me
take my hand *

721
00:46:32,958 --> 00:46:36,027
* And we'll run

722
00:46:36,061 --> 00:46:39,064
* To a land where the
river runs free *

723
00:46:39,097 --> 00:46:41,833
* To a land through
the green country *

724
00:46:41,867 --> 00:46:44,970
* To a land to a shining sea

725
00:46:45,003 --> 00:46:47,973
* To a land where
the horses run free *

726
00:46:48,006 --> 00:46:51,042
* To a land where the
children are free *

727
00:46:51,076 --> 00:46:54,145
* And you and me
are free to be *

728
00:46:54,179 --> 00:46:57,282
* And you and me are
free to be *

729
00:46:57,315 --> 00:47:00,919
* And you and me
are free to be *

730
00:47:00,952 --> 00:47:05,023
* You and me.

731
00:47:22,473 --> 00:47:26,444
(Isa singing)

732
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:05,216
(singing continues)

733
00:48:30,275 --> 00:48:32,110
That's pretty.

734
00:48:33,611 --> 00:48:36,014
Where'd you learn
that song?

735
00:48:36,047 --> 00:48:39,084
Mmm, I just keep
dreaming about it.

736
00:48:39,117 --> 00:48:41,052
(June)
You dreamt that?

737
00:48:41,086 --> 00:48:43,221
What language is it?

738
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:47,492
I don't know.

739
00:48:47,525 --> 00:48:50,761
I just woke up
knowing those words.

740
00:48:54,632 --> 00:48:57,702
I just keep thinking
about Mom.

741
00:49:00,005 --> 00:49:02,507
If she's still
down there somewhere.

742
00:49:09,247 --> 00:49:13,151
I know that they did everything
that they could, but...

743
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:17,188
I can't help feeling that
if we went down there,

744
00:49:17,222 --> 00:49:19,524
we would be able
to find her.

745
00:49:28,766 --> 00:49:31,169
Josh and I were talking today

746
00:49:31,202 --> 00:49:33,204
about, um, the plans
for the house,

747
00:49:33,238 --> 00:49:37,775
and he's really been
helping me, like, solidify them.

748
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:40,611
And, I spoke to my dad.

749
00:49:40,645 --> 00:49:44,449
Um... I think he's
really on board.

750
00:49:44,482 --> 00:49:46,751
He just mentioned that I
need a business proposal

751
00:49:46,784 --> 00:49:50,221
just to make it really
official, and like...

752
00:49:50,255 --> 00:49:53,058
just like the structure.
Right.

753
00:49:53,091 --> 00:49:55,226
I thought you might be
really good at that.

754
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:57,595
I am really good at that.
I had a feeling.

755
00:49:57,628 --> 00:50:00,665
Um, yes, I can absolutely
help you with that.

756
00:50:00,698 --> 00:50:02,167
Thank you.

757
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:05,203
If you kind of draft
out all of your ideas,

758
00:50:05,236 --> 00:50:06,771
all of the thoughts that
you've been having

759
00:50:06,804 --> 00:50:10,241
for this commune thing,

760
00:50:10,275 --> 00:50:13,478
then I will help put it
into some structure

761
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:15,213
and we can do a
formal business plan.

762
00:50:15,246 --> 00:50:16,481
Thank you.
I wouldn't say a
commune around here.

763
00:50:16,514 --> 00:50:19,117
I wouldn't use that word,
'cause I think that

764
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:22,087
you might get into a
little bit of hot water.

765
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:24,222
But it's more
like a...

766
00:50:24,255 --> 00:50:27,158
Like a...
Like a school, or uh...

767
00:50:27,192 --> 00:50:30,195
Or like a place for people
to practice what they do.

768
00:50:30,228 --> 00:50:32,597
Like, I think that's missing
from so many people's life.

769
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:35,633
It's just like space.
You know, just like a space.

770
00:50:35,666 --> 00:50:37,468
(laughs)
Shut up!

771
00:50:37,502 --> 00:50:39,104
I'm serious though.
(laughing)
Sorry.

772
00:50:39,137 --> 00:50:40,571
No, but I'm
super serious.

773
00:50:40,605 --> 00:50:41,739
I love...
You're so sweet.

774
00:50:41,772 --> 00:50:43,508
But it's true.
No, but it's true.

775
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:46,277
Into the unknown, but this
might be amazing for you,

776
00:50:46,311 --> 00:50:47,845
is that we'd turn our bedroom

777
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:51,282
into like a video
editing facility.

778
00:50:51,316 --> 00:50:52,683
(June)
Yeah, that would be great.

779
00:50:52,717 --> 00:50:54,085
And you could come
during the summer.

780
00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:55,153
Mm-hmm.
And it's yours.

781
00:50:55,186 --> 00:50:56,721
Yeah.
You know?

782
00:50:56,754 --> 00:50:59,224
And, um, well,
but I also thought,

783
00:50:59,257 --> 00:51:02,727
like, make the sunroom
like a painter's studio.

784
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,162
Mm-hmm.
You know, you have the light.

785
00:51:04,195 --> 00:51:05,696
You have the view...
Why is that funny?

786
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:08,533
(laughing) I don't know.
It's a great idea.

787
00:51:08,566 --> 00:51:10,268
We really could.

788
00:51:10,301 --> 00:51:12,637
Like, we have a
little bit of land.

789
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:14,405
We could even
grow things.

790
00:51:14,439 --> 00:51:16,474
It's just, like, it's just...
(laughing)
A compost.

791
00:51:16,507 --> 00:51:19,344
We could be totally
self-sufficient.
Oh, my God, she's dying.

792
00:51:19,377 --> 00:51:20,878
(laughing)

793
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:22,780
It could be completely
self-sufficient.

794
00:51:22,813 --> 00:51:24,782
Wait, are you, like,
into this or not?

795
00:51:24,815 --> 00:51:28,186
I can't tell.
I think she's...

796
00:51:28,219 --> 00:51:31,189
I love that
she's so into it.

797
00:51:31,222 --> 00:51:32,423
See, I knew
you would win.

798
00:51:32,457 --> 00:51:33,591
I love it.

799
00:51:33,624 --> 00:51:35,526
(laughing)

800
00:51:39,297 --> 00:51:41,866
(June)
It's great.
Let's do it.

801
00:51:41,899 --> 00:51:43,901
Let's do it.
Why not?

802
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:46,671
You should name it
after your mom.

803
00:51:46,704 --> 00:51:48,706
That's a really
beautiful...

804
00:51:48,739 --> 00:51:52,643
The Amelia Brooks
Art Institute.

805
00:51:52,677 --> 00:51:54,912
(all)
Institute.

806
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:56,814
(June)
Cheers.

807
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:07,792
(chuckles)

808
00:52:07,825 --> 00:52:09,527
Look.

809
00:52:13,864 --> 00:52:16,901
What do you think, June?

810
00:52:16,934 --> 00:52:19,270
(June)
Looks good.

811
00:52:19,304 --> 00:52:22,707
Oh, God.

812
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:25,610
(Annie)
Isa! Isa!

813
00:52:25,643 --> 00:52:29,647
Isa! Isa! Isa!
Isa! Isa!

814
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:32,383
(cheering, laughing)

815
00:52:32,417 --> 00:52:33,684
(June)
Those shorts.
Those shorts.

816
00:52:33,718 --> 00:52:35,220
Do you remember?

817
00:52:35,253 --> 00:52:37,522
She wore them all the time.
Come on, every day.

818
00:52:37,555 --> 00:52:38,656
Oh, Mom?

819
00:52:38,689 --> 00:52:40,358
Justice for our lake.

820
00:52:40,391 --> 00:52:43,728
Justice for our lake.
Justice for our lake.

821
00:52:43,761 --> 00:52:45,463
Justice for our lake.

822
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:49,234
(all)
No, no, we won't go!
No, no, we won't go!

823
00:52:49,267 --> 00:52:50,601
No, no...
(laughter)

824
00:52:50,635 --> 00:52:54,339
Please. Please.
Please. Please.

825
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:58,843
(Isa)
You can do it.

826
00:52:58,876 --> 00:53:02,280
(sighs deeply)

827
00:53:03,414 --> 00:53:06,551
You look just like Mom.
You know that?

828
00:53:06,584 --> 00:53:07,918
(Isa and June)
Annie!

829
00:53:07,952 --> 00:53:12,457
Annie! Annie!
Annie! Annie!

830
00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:14,659
(singing)
The...

831
00:53:14,692 --> 00:53:18,663
moon is shining.

832
00:53:18,696 --> 00:53:23,434
(other girls singing along)
The stars are sparkling.

833
00:53:23,468 --> 00:53:27,538
The lake fairies
are here

834
00:53:27,572 --> 00:53:32,410
to bring you to bed.

835
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:36,714
Where are
my babies?

836
00:53:36,747 --> 00:53:41,386
My sweet little babies?

837
00:53:41,419 --> 00:53:44,389
Mama is here...

838
00:53:44,422 --> 00:53:48,859
(all girls)
to bring you to bed.

839
00:53:50,495 --> 00:53:52,497
Who's ready for bed?

840
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:55,900
Are all my little girls
ready for bed?

841
00:53:55,933 --> 00:53:58,436
Mama's here
to tuck you in.

842
00:54:00,805 --> 00:54:02,973
Annie?

843
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:05,576
Why aren't the girls
ready for bed?

844
00:54:07,412 --> 00:54:09,347
I asked you over a
half an hour ago to get them

845
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:11,682
into their pajamas and
to brush their teeth,

846
00:54:11,716 --> 00:54:12,817
and nothing has happened.

847
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:14,885
Why aren't they
ready for bed?

848
00:54:16,687 --> 00:54:18,789
You never listen to me.

849
00:54:21,025 --> 00:54:23,861
Do you have no respect
for your mother?

850
00:54:23,894 --> 00:54:26,063
You're such a
little daddy's girl.

851
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:28,399
That's the only person
that you'll listen to.

852
00:54:28,433 --> 00:54:31,936
I asked you to help
with your sisters.

853
00:54:31,969 --> 00:54:34,372
Must I do it
all on my own?

854
00:54:34,405 --> 00:54:37,041
I have to do everything
all on my own.

855
00:54:37,074 --> 00:54:39,710
The only person who loves me
in this whole house is the dog.

856
00:54:39,744 --> 00:54:41,979
Do you want me to
just sleep with the dog?
Is that what I should do?

857
00:54:42,012 --> 00:54:44,482
I should just go and
sleep with the dog.

858
00:54:44,515 --> 00:54:47,785
You're a selfish little brat.
You're a selfish little brat!

859
00:54:47,818 --> 00:54:49,954
All I wanted was a
little bit of help.

860
00:54:51,456 --> 00:54:54,859
All I wanted was
a little bit of help.

861
00:54:54,892 --> 00:54:56,927
Is that too much to ask?

862
00:54:56,961 --> 00:54:59,797
I have to get up
early in the morning.

863
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:02,567
(laughing)

864
00:55:04,935 --> 00:55:07,838
Let me go again.
Let me go again.

865
00:55:15,112 --> 00:55:17,682
I'm gonna go again and
I'm just gonna do the song.

866
00:55:17,715 --> 00:55:19,684
Okay, I'm just
gonna do the song.

867
00:55:19,717 --> 00:55:21,686
(girls crying, sniffling)

868
00:55:21,719 --> 00:55:23,588
Okay?

869
00:55:28,693 --> 00:55:30,428
(laughs)

870
00:55:32,129 --> 00:55:35,466
(singing)
The moon is shining.

871
00:55:37,668 --> 00:55:41,005
The stars are sparkling.

872
00:55:41,038 --> 00:55:46,844
The lake fairies are here
to bring you to bed.

873
00:55:47,745 --> 00:55:51,048
Where are my babies?

874
00:55:53,651 --> 00:55:57,988
My sweet little babies?

875
00:55:58,022 --> 00:56:04,529
'Cause Mama is here
to bring you to bed.

876
00:56:19,544 --> 00:56:24,114
Don't forget
to breathe, Junebug.

877
00:56:24,148 --> 00:56:27,485
(inhales deeply)

878
00:56:27,518 --> 00:56:29,987
(exhaling)

879
00:56:34,859 --> 00:56:37,462
There, that's better.

880
00:57:12,830 --> 00:57:14,565
(June whispering)
Hey.

881
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:18,769
Get up.

882
00:57:18,803 --> 00:57:21,205
I have to show
you something.

883
00:57:40,525 --> 00:57:42,259
(Annie)
That's beautiful, June.

884
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:44,895
(June)
Yeah, it is very beautiful,
but I didn't take it.

885
00:57:44,929 --> 00:57:47,632
That's what I wanted
to ask you guys about.

886
00:57:47,665 --> 00:57:49,834
I mean, we didn't
take it.

887
00:57:52,002 --> 00:57:53,704
You think
we took it?

888
00:57:53,738 --> 00:57:55,773
Well, I didn't
take it.

889
00:57:55,806 --> 00:57:58,242
So, somebody else did.

890
00:57:58,275 --> 00:58:00,077
I woke up this morning and
this footage was on my camera

891
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:02,880
and I didn't take it.

892
00:58:02,913 --> 00:58:04,281
You sure you didn't
take it a couple days ago

893
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:05,750
and you just didn't
check the footage?

894
00:58:05,783 --> 00:58:07,952
Yes. I'm sure.

895
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:10,287
You guys were sleeping on
the couch and I left
my camera down here.

896
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,723
I really actually
don't care if you did,
I just want to know.

897
00:58:12,757 --> 00:58:14,892
Yeah, but first of all,
I wouldn't touch your
camera, and I didn't do this.

898
00:58:14,925 --> 00:58:16,694
Yeah, I wouldn't touch
your camera either.

899
00:58:16,727 --> 00:58:18,228
Just, it's not funny anymore,
I'm getting really freaked out.

900
00:58:18,262 --> 00:58:19,797
But I'm not trying to
play a joke on you,

901
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:21,131
I just didn't
touch your camera.

902
00:58:21,165 --> 00:58:23,901
(Annie)
All right, this is
getting really weird.

903
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:27,204
What?

904
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:33,544
I found another bird
this morning.

905
00:58:33,578 --> 00:58:35,112
(Josh)
I told you already
about the birds,

906
00:58:35,145 --> 00:58:36,914
it's just the time
of the year, it's not...

907
00:58:36,947 --> 00:58:38,115
(Annie)
I would be able
to believe that

908
00:58:38,148 --> 00:58:39,850
if it was just one,
but every single day.

909
00:58:39,884 --> 00:58:41,251
I know, but it's
this time of year...

910
00:58:41,285 --> 00:58:43,253
Isa, do you promise me?

911
00:58:43,287 --> 00:58:45,923
June, I swear, I didn't
touch your camera.

912
00:58:45,956 --> 00:58:47,558
I wouldn't do anything
like that to you.

913
00:58:47,592 --> 00:58:49,259
I really, really, don't care
if you did, but I...

914
00:58:49,293 --> 00:58:51,729
But I didn't, you just have
to believe that I didn't.

915
00:58:51,762 --> 00:58:54,599
I don't like getting
blamed for it.

916
00:58:54,632 --> 00:58:56,333
(Annie)
I think we should
call the police.

917
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:57,635
Me too.

918
00:58:57,668 --> 00:58:59,003
What are you gonna
tell the police?

919
00:58:59,036 --> 00:59:00,204
We need to report
that somebody broke

920
00:59:00,237 --> 00:59:02,006
into the house and
stole her camera.

921
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:04,008
Okay, somebody broke
into the house, they
stole the camera,

922
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:05,743
they went out to
the dock, and then
they filmed some stuff...

923
00:59:05,776 --> 00:59:07,177
Something really
weird is going on...
and then they came back in,

924
00:59:07,211 --> 00:59:09,847
and then they just decided
to leave the camera,

925
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:12,182
and put it back.
Yeah, that's a
crime isn't it?

926
00:59:12,216 --> 00:59:14,819
I mean, do you think Mom
could be doing this?

927
00:59:14,852 --> 00:59:16,220
Mom had nothing
to do with this.

928
00:59:16,253 --> 00:59:17,187
Jesus, come on.

929
00:59:17,221 --> 00:59:20,024
Why are you laughing at me?
It's not funny.

930
00:59:20,057 --> 00:59:21,992
Okay, June your mom
came back from the dead,

931
00:59:22,026 --> 00:59:23,694
and she knows how
to use the camera.
Okay, that's enough.

932
00:59:23,728 --> 00:59:25,663
She went down to
the lake, she did a
time lapse just for fun.

933
00:59:25,696 --> 00:59:27,665
That's enough.
And then she put it back
for you just to kinda find.

934
00:59:27,698 --> 00:59:28,733
Hey!

935
00:59:28,766 --> 00:59:31,368
I mean,
you guys gotta...

936
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:32,670
Really.

937
00:59:32,703 --> 00:59:35,372
(Annie)
Let's just leave it.

938
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:38,709
All right.

939
00:59:38,743 --> 00:59:43,147
I just have this really
bad feeling that...

940
00:59:45,249 --> 00:59:47,785
that night that
we went out

941
00:59:47,818 --> 00:59:49,620
and we summoned
the seventh sister,

942
00:59:49,654 --> 00:59:52,356
that we, like, opened
some kind of door that
we shouldn't have.

943
00:59:52,389 --> 00:59:53,390
(Annie)
No.

944
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:55,693
(Josh)
No, it's a tale.

945
00:59:55,726 --> 00:59:58,295
That's all
it is, okay?

946
00:59:58,328 --> 00:59:59,964
Hey, you know what?

947
00:59:59,997 --> 01:00:01,265
Let's go see
Maggie Holmes.

948
01:00:01,298 --> 01:00:02,667
She's lived here forever.

949
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:04,368
She knows all about
the folklore.

950
01:00:04,401 --> 01:00:06,837
You can ask her about
the seven sisters, okay?

951
01:00:06,871 --> 01:00:08,639
If that'll make
you feel better.

952
01:00:10,074 --> 01:00:12,276
(Maggie)
In the olden days,

953
01:00:12,309 --> 01:00:15,145
the period costumes were
so heavy and so layered,

954
01:00:15,179 --> 01:00:19,316
pantaloons and petticoats
on top of one another.

955
01:00:19,349 --> 01:00:22,887
And this particular family
was very conservative

956
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:25,389
and they didn't
want their seven girls

957
01:00:25,422 --> 01:00:27,357
to disrobe and swim.

958
01:00:27,391 --> 01:00:31,996
And this one night
it was so sweltering hot

959
01:00:32,029 --> 01:00:34,398
that they snuck out at midnight,

960
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:38,268
took off their clothes
and went for a swim.

961
01:00:38,302 --> 01:00:43,140
The first sister
went in and didn't emerge.

962
01:00:43,173 --> 01:00:47,878
And the second one followed,
and didn't emerge.

963
01:00:49,046 --> 01:00:52,016
And the third
and fourth.

964
01:00:52,049 --> 01:00:54,151
All seven went in.

965
01:00:54,184 --> 01:00:56,954
Do you think that
if you summon

966
01:00:56,987 --> 01:00:59,089
the seventh sister,
then she'll pull you under

967
01:00:59,123 --> 01:01:02,760
next time you swim?

968
01:01:02,793 --> 01:01:05,129
You know, I don't
know about that.

969
01:01:07,231 --> 01:01:10,067
I know that I had

970
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:13,738
a very odd experience
many years ago.

971
01:01:13,771 --> 01:01:17,842
I went into the
water off the dock,

972
01:01:17,875 --> 01:01:20,878
and I dove down.

973
01:01:20,911 --> 01:01:24,915
And suddenly, I saw
this tiny light...

974
01:01:24,949 --> 01:01:27,752
A very bright light.

975
01:01:27,785 --> 01:01:30,254
It was simply
beautiful,

976
01:01:30,287 --> 01:01:35,059
and I felt this
pull toward it,

977
01:01:35,092 --> 01:01:37,795
'til, all of a sudden,

978
01:01:37,828 --> 01:01:39,897
it wasn't a
comfortable pull.

979
01:01:39,930 --> 01:01:45,169
I felt that I had no power
to stop from going down.

980
01:01:45,202 --> 01:01:49,139
So, I fought to turn
myself around as...

981
01:01:49,173 --> 01:01:51,776
It was if I was
fighting a current...

982
01:01:51,809 --> 01:01:54,178
And with all my strength,

983
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:57,514
I rose to the top
of the water.

984
01:01:57,547 --> 01:02:00,250
And I remember
gasping for breath.

985
01:02:00,284 --> 01:02:05,155
And as I approached
the ladder,

986
01:02:05,189 --> 01:02:10,861
this overwhelming
sense came to me

987
01:02:10,895 --> 01:02:13,530
that I should
go back or look back.

988
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:17,167
But it was a very great
sense of loss

989
01:02:17,201 --> 01:02:20,504
that I have
even to this day,

990
01:02:20,537 --> 01:02:26,043
that... I left something
down there.

991
01:02:29,546 --> 01:02:33,417
So, you girls...

992
01:02:35,152 --> 01:02:39,489
you dear girls,
you take good care, please.

993
01:02:39,523 --> 01:02:41,892
Just use wisdom.

994
01:02:45,029 --> 01:02:46,463
(Josh)
If you want,
you can stay with me,

995
01:02:46,496 --> 01:02:48,198
if it'll make it easier.

996
01:02:50,167 --> 01:02:52,202
Make you feel better.

997
01:02:57,441 --> 01:02:59,476
Yeah, I don't know.

998
01:03:04,448 --> 01:03:07,084
Are you guys actually...

999
01:03:07,117 --> 01:03:09,319
Are you still thinking
about selling the house?

1000
01:03:09,353 --> 01:03:11,021
Mm-hmm.

1001
01:03:15,893 --> 01:03:18,362
I thought you said
you wanted to stay.

1002
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:29,940
I don't know.

1003
01:03:34,011 --> 01:03:36,180
June, can you
just back off?

1004
01:03:36,213 --> 01:03:38,949
You know what? Let's go
somewhere and talk.

1005
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:38,368
(breathes deeply)

1006
01:05:48,678 --> 01:05:51,015
(splash)

1007
01:05:51,048 --> 01:05:53,517
(breathing through mask)

1008
01:06:31,555 --> 01:06:34,224
(faint singing)

1009
01:06:40,430 --> 01:06:41,498
(echoing scream)

1010
01:06:41,531 --> 01:06:44,201
(panicked breathing)

1011
01:06:53,310 --> 01:06:56,113
(panicked breathing
intensifies)

1012
01:07:17,201 --> 01:07:19,803
(panicked breathing
subsides)

1013
01:07:49,666 --> 01:07:52,302
(June humming)

1014
01:07:56,406 --> 01:07:58,842
(humming continues)

1015
01:08:05,682 --> 01:08:07,751
(Isa)
Yeah.

1016
01:08:07,784 --> 01:08:10,620
That's the same one
from my dream.

1017
01:08:10,654 --> 01:08:13,290
I thought so.

1018
01:08:13,323 --> 01:08:15,392
Do you still
dream it?

1019
01:08:17,794 --> 01:08:20,230
No, it stopped.

1020
01:08:22,599 --> 01:08:24,501
And...

1021
01:08:26,536 --> 01:08:29,273
I'm kind of relieved
'cause...

1022
01:08:32,476 --> 01:08:38,848
there was always something that
felt like it was calling me...

1023
01:08:38,882 --> 01:08:43,820
to somewhere...
something dangerous.

1024
01:08:47,424 --> 01:08:50,327
June, don't go swimming
in the lake.

1025
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:52,229
Why not?

1026
01:08:53,830 --> 01:08:56,400
(knocking)

1027
01:08:56,433 --> 01:08:57,801
Yeah?

1028
01:08:57,834 --> 01:08:59,436
Hi.
Hi.

1029
01:08:59,469 --> 01:09:00,804
Can I sleep with
you guys tonight?

1030
01:09:00,837 --> 01:09:02,406
I don't wanna be alone.

1031
01:09:02,439 --> 01:09:05,242
Yeah, of course.

1032
01:09:05,275 --> 01:09:06,476
You okay?

1033
01:09:06,510 --> 01:09:08,278
Yeah.

1034
01:09:08,312 --> 01:09:10,314
I felt like
such a little kid.

1035
01:09:10,347 --> 01:09:13,383
You know, just every
little noise that I heard

1036
01:09:13,417 --> 01:09:17,321
was making me feel
so freaked out,

1037
01:09:17,354 --> 01:09:19,389
and I started
holding my breath in bed,

1038
01:09:19,423 --> 01:09:23,827
and I swear I heard
a baby crying.

1039
01:09:28,665 --> 01:09:33,303
Is it my mind
playing tricks on me?

1040
01:09:33,337 --> 01:09:36,773
(Isa)
I think something
is telling us to go.

1041
01:10:13,277 --> 01:10:15,445
(June)
It's really weird... it's
almost exactly the same

1042
01:10:15,479 --> 01:10:17,547
as the other one, but
it's a little bit closer

1043
01:10:17,581 --> 01:10:19,549
this time, I think.

1044
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:25,722
What is that?

1045
01:10:25,755 --> 01:10:27,257
Do you see that?
Yeah.

1046
01:10:27,291 --> 01:10:28,792
What?
I don't know.

1047
01:10:28,825 --> 01:10:31,561
I saw something flash
by the... right here.

1048
01:10:31,595 --> 01:10:34,531
Oh!
Whoa.

1049
01:10:34,564 --> 01:10:36,266
I totally missed that.

1050
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:39,469
(Isa)
Oh, my God, it's the
seventh sister.

1051
01:10:39,503 --> 01:10:42,539
Isn't that you?

1052
01:10:42,572 --> 01:10:44,040
That's you, June.

1053
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:46,510
That's impossible,
I didn't take this.

1054
01:10:46,543 --> 01:10:49,446
Something really, really
weird is going on.

1055
01:10:50,714 --> 01:10:54,784
Okay, I need you to put down
the camera for a little while.

1056
01:10:56,586 --> 01:10:58,021
Why?

1057
01:10:58,054 --> 01:10:59,556
Let's just talk
about this, okay?

1058
01:10:59,589 --> 01:11:00,724
We should talk.

1059
01:11:00,757 --> 01:11:03,393
We can talk about it
with the camera.

1060
01:11:03,427 --> 01:11:05,829
Put it down, June.
You guys,
I didn't take that.

1061
01:11:05,862 --> 01:11:07,731
She's not asking, June.
Put the camera down.

1062
01:11:07,764 --> 01:11:09,999
I'm not gonna put
the camera down.

1063
01:11:13,703 --> 01:11:16,340
(sniffling)

1064
01:11:17,807 --> 01:11:19,609
Take a deep breath, June.
(scoffs)

1065
01:11:19,643 --> 01:11:22,446
Take a deep breath.

1066
01:11:22,479 --> 01:11:23,980
It's okay.

1067
01:11:24,013 --> 01:11:27,551
We're so proud of
you for... for...

1068
01:11:27,584 --> 01:11:28,918
how far you've come

1069
01:11:28,952 --> 01:11:30,487
and how well
you've been doing,

1070
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:33,056
and we just don't wanna
see you revert back.

1071
01:11:33,089 --> 01:11:36,726
And I think that
being home is just...

1072
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:39,863
It's too hard.
It's too hard for you.

1073
01:11:39,896 --> 01:11:42,466
It's... it's too hard
for all of us.

1074
01:11:42,499 --> 01:11:44,834
But I'm doing
really well.

1075
01:11:47,437 --> 01:11:49,072
(Isa)
I went into your closet

1076
01:11:49,105 --> 01:11:51,875
and I noticed that you
have the shawl.

1077
01:11:51,908 --> 01:11:54,478
And I went to pick it up,

1078
01:11:54,511 --> 01:11:58,382
and inside of it
I found a dead bird.

1079
01:11:58,415 --> 01:12:01,385
We know that you've been
sneaking out at night,

1080
01:12:01,418 --> 01:12:04,654
and you've been
leaving the birds...

1081
01:12:04,688 --> 01:12:06,823
and the time lapses.

1082
01:12:06,856 --> 01:12:09,493
(June sighs, sniffles)

1083
01:12:11,461 --> 01:12:14,898
I think that we should all
go out onto the dock

1084
01:12:14,931 --> 01:12:17,934
and say our
goodbyes to Mom

1085
01:12:17,967 --> 01:12:20,003
and then we should go.

1086
01:12:22,071 --> 01:12:25,008
But the camera's
not invited.

1087
01:12:28,712 --> 01:12:31,347
(June continues crying,
sniffling)

1088
01:12:40,824 --> 01:12:42,125
(door closing)

1089
01:12:44,928 --> 01:12:46,996
(June)
You guys?

1090
01:12:47,030 --> 01:12:48,798
You guys?
(Annie)
What?

1091
01:12:48,832 --> 01:12:52,536
I'm sorry.
You guys were right.

1092
01:12:52,569 --> 01:12:55,439
I... I didn't mean to do
any of this stuff.

1093
01:12:55,472 --> 01:12:57,574
I didn't... I don't think
I even knew I was doing it,

1094
01:12:57,607 --> 01:12:59,976
but I was just
so sad about Mom,

1095
01:13:00,009 --> 01:13:02,579
and just so upset,
and I just...

1096
01:13:02,612 --> 01:13:04,914
(sniffling)
I'm sorry, I just got confused,

1097
01:13:04,948 --> 01:13:06,650
and I was just dealing with
it in the wrong way.

1098
01:13:06,683 --> 01:13:08,585
But I promise
I'll... I promise

1099
01:13:08,618 --> 01:13:11,921
I won't do it
anymore, and I...

1100
01:13:11,955 --> 01:13:13,823
(Annie)
We're not gonna
do this again.

1101
01:13:13,857 --> 01:13:18,428
We've been down this road
before, and we're not
gonna do it again.

1102
01:13:18,462 --> 01:13:20,664
(Isa)
We see that you're starting
to spiral out of control.

1103
01:13:20,697 --> 01:13:21,965
I'm not spiraling
out of control.

1104
01:13:21,998 --> 01:13:23,433
And the doctors
have always told us

1105
01:13:23,467 --> 01:13:25,735
that when we are with you,
we enable you.

1106
01:13:25,769 --> 01:13:27,103
Oh, my God, I am not
out of control.

1107
01:13:27,136 --> 01:13:29,205
The doctors are idiots.
They don't know anything.

1108
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:31,107
I'm sorry if you're too
scared to deal with it.

1109
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:33,109
I'm sorry if you're cowards,
but I'm your sister.

1110
01:13:33,142 --> 01:13:34,911
You listen to my
words right now.

1111
01:13:34,944 --> 01:13:36,980
I'm not doing this
with you again.

1112
01:13:37,013 --> 01:13:38,582
We're leaving
in three hours,

1113
01:13:38,615 --> 01:13:40,116
and you can get in that
car and go home with us...

1114
01:13:40,149 --> 01:13:41,718
How can you talk
to me like that?

1115
01:13:41,751 --> 01:13:43,853
Or you stay.
It's your decision.
Look at me!

1116
01:13:43,887 --> 01:13:44,988
It's your decision.

1117
01:13:45,021 --> 01:13:48,625
What is wrong with you?

1118
01:13:48,658 --> 01:13:51,761
What the hell is wrong
with you guys?

1119
01:13:51,795 --> 01:13:53,863
I hate you so much!

1120
01:13:53,897 --> 01:13:56,232
Ah, I hate
you guys!

1121
01:13:56,265 --> 01:13:58,502
(breathing deeply)

1122
01:14:05,675 --> 01:14:08,144
(sniffling)

1123
01:14:11,815 --> 01:14:14,618
(sighing)

1124
01:14:30,567 --> 01:14:32,235
(whispering)
Mom.

1125
01:14:44,814 --> 01:14:48,585
Mom, do you believe me?

1126
01:14:50,754 --> 01:14:52,622
Do you believe me?

1127
01:15:02,198 --> 01:15:04,534
(sniffling)

1128
01:16:06,630 --> 01:16:08,064
(splash)

1129
01:17:31,214 --> 01:17:32,215
(record playing)

1130
01:17:32,248 --> 01:17:36,019
* I see a land
bright and clear *

1131
01:17:36,052 --> 01:17:39,689
* And the time's
coming near, when... *

1132
01:17:39,723 --> 01:17:43,226
(song skips, starts over)

1133
01:17:43,259 --> 01:17:46,930
* I see a land
bright and clear *

1134
01:17:46,963 --> 01:17:50,199
* And the time's
coming near... *

1135
01:17:50,233 --> 01:17:51,868
(door creaking)

1136
01:17:52,902 --> 01:17:55,939
(rain falling, wind blowing)

1137
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:05,014
(humming)

1138
01:18:05,882 --> 01:18:10,119
(singing)

1139
01:18:42,986 --> 01:18:46,122
I'll just read my
favorite passages.

1140
01:18:51,527 --> 01:18:53,229
(man)
Which one?

1141
01:18:56,032 --> 01:18:58,301
"Though inland far we be,"

1142
01:18:58,334 --> 01:19:02,071
"our souls have sight
of that immortal sea"

1143
01:19:02,105 --> 01:19:04,440
"which brought us hither."

1144
01:19:07,376 --> 01:19:11,781
"Our birth is but a sleep
and a forgetting."

1145
01:19:11,815 --> 01:19:16,920
"The soul that rises
with us, our life's Star,"

1146
01:19:16,953 --> 01:19:23,126
"hath had elsewhere its setting
and cometh from afar."

1147
01:19:26,029 --> 01:19:29,165
"Not in entire
forgetfulness,

1148
01:19:29,198 --> 01:19:33,336
"and not in
utter nakedness,

1149
01:19:33,369 --> 01:19:37,006
but in trailing clouds
we come."

1150
01:19:48,517 --> 01:19:50,019
(door opening)

1151
01:20:41,504 --> 01:20:44,240
(bubbling)

1152
01:20:46,009 --> 01:20:50,179
(breathing with mask)

1153
01:21:54,510 --> 01:21:57,146
(faint singing)

1154
01:22:01,084 --> 01:22:04,187
(singing becomes louder)

1155
01:22:13,462 --> 01:22:15,965
(singing stops abruptly)

1156
01:22:15,999 --> 01:22:18,467
(humming)

1157
01:22:19,535 --> 01:22:23,006
(baby cooing)

1158
01:22:28,411 --> 01:22:31,247
(people speaking in
native language throughout)
