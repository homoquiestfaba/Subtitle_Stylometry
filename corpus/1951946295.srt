1
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,282
Take it easy, Peter.

2
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:25,886
Not the kind of research
you expected, huh?

3
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,452
Relax.

4
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:29,723
Sit back and enjoy the ride.

5
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:54,147
Take a shot in his head!

6
00:01:57,984 --> 00:02:00,420
Lord, have mercy.

7
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:07,794
My arm!

8
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:23,343
So, what do you think?

9
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:26,678
Glad you came, right?

10
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:29,115
You said you wanted to be rich.

11
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,518
Well, this is what it looks like.

12
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:35,789
Glad you made yourself comfortable.

13
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:52,205
God!

14
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:00,647
God help us.

15
00:05:22,768 --> 00:05:25,724
So, what you're stating is that
wexel Hall Pharmaceuticals...

16
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,017
have denied knowledge
of genetic testing...

17
00:05:28,049 --> 00:05:30,905
on animals at their secret labs
in Eastern Europe.

18
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:34,826
The fact that CEO J.D. Murdoch
personally contacted Peter...

19
00:05:34,861 --> 00:05:37,881
to deny these claims,
we feel gave total credence...

20
00:05:37,915 --> 00:05:41,768
to the leak that testing was more
inhumane than we have ever seen.

21
00:05:41,803 --> 00:05:44,692
Can you be more specific
without divulging your informants?

22
00:05:44,727 --> 00:05:47,514
Our sources reported and I quote:

23
00:05:47,549 --> 00:05:51,900
"The testing we witnessed is
more cruel, more grotesquely evil...

24
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:55,986
than the American people
could ever imagine. "

25
00:05:57,481 --> 00:06:00,106
Good morning, Mr. Murdoch.

26
00:06:01,035 --> 00:06:03,693
Good morning, Mr. Murdoch.

27
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:07,646
Good morning, Mr. Murdoch.

28
00:06:22,596 --> 00:06:24,156
Stay.

29
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:27,047
Good morning, Mr. Murdoch.

30
00:06:27,246 --> 00:06:29,970
Handshake says a lot about a man,
Pinkus.

31
00:06:30,004 --> 00:06:32,095
Yes, sir.

32
00:06:41,694 --> 00:06:43,655
Can I get you a cup of coffee, sir?

33
00:06:43,689 --> 00:06:45,099
Cut the pleasantries.

34
00:06:45,134 --> 00:06:46,512
There's been a leak.

35
00:06:46,547 --> 00:06:48,223
A leak?

36
00:06:48,258 --> 00:06:49,864
PETA.

37
00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:53,584
People for the Ethical Treatment
of Animals...

38
00:06:53,619 --> 00:06:57,238
have launched an enquiry
with public relations.

39
00:06:57,273 --> 00:07:01,458
Where exactly is our facility
and what exactly are we doing there?

40
00:07:01,493 --> 00:07:04,131
Now I'm asking myself,
"How did they find out about us?"

41
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:06,772
Well, I can assure you, Mr. Murdoch.
I will find out.

42
00:07:06,807 --> 00:07:09,696
I am the public face of Wexel Hall.

43
00:07:09,697 --> 00:07:11,754
When that face is damaged...

44
00:07:11,755 --> 00:07:13,912
- I am damaged.
- I understand, sir.

45
00:07:13,947 --> 00:07:16,837
Not to mention that every
drug company in the world...

46
00:07:16,872 --> 00:07:19,927
is crawling up our ass,
trying to beat us to the finish line.

47
00:07:19,961 --> 00:07:22,982
I could double security
but until we've identified the source...

48
00:07:22,986 --> 00:07:25,608
- it would be pointless.
- It is your job!

49
00:07:25,643 --> 00:07:26,901
And you will do your job.

50
00:07:26,935 --> 00:07:29,924
Or the only thing you'll be supervising
is a proctologist...

51
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:32,847
removing my boot from your rectum.
Do you understand?

52
00:07:32,882 --> 00:07:34,207
Yes, sir.

53
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:36,966
What is the status of the project?

54
00:07:36,967 --> 00:07:39,588
We've hit some delays.

55
00:07:39,623 --> 00:07:42,912
You've hit some delays.
Now why is it I'm not surprised?

56
00:07:42,946 --> 00:07:44,638
What sort of delays?

57
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:48,625
Kane will answer all your questions.

58
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,916
Where is Kane?

59
00:07:56,334 --> 00:07:58,357
Just this way, sir.

60
00:07:58,392 --> 00:08:02,841
This is a live feed
of the queen anaconda's tank.

61
00:08:06,263 --> 00:08:08,089
Completely motionless.

62
00:08:08,124 --> 00:08:09,915
Just like my first wife.

63
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:12,038
Don't let her slumber fool you.

64
00:08:12,073 --> 00:08:15,361
She's 1200 pounds
of pure crushing power.

65
00:08:15,396 --> 00:08:17,253
As I said, just like my first wife.

66
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,145
Good to see you, Mr. Murdoch.

67
00:08:19,179 --> 00:08:21,302
I wasn't expecting you
until next week.

68
00:08:21,337 --> 00:08:23,695
Professor, as you know,
I'm a man in a hurry.

69
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:26,053
Our staff's been working
around the clock...

70
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:28,743
and I'm fully aware
of your schedule.

71
00:08:28,778 --> 00:08:31,363
Good.
Because I'm paying you for results.

72
00:08:31,398 --> 00:08:34,787
As you know, we have successfully
synthesised and produced...

73
00:08:34,822 --> 00:08:36,180
a blood-orchid extract.

74
00:08:36,214 --> 00:08:40,298
Our patient tolerates the serum
just like snakes in the wild do...

75
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:42,955
with zero negative side effects.

76
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,145
And no signs of aging.

77
00:08:45,179 --> 00:08:47,969
The synthetic serum
is fully efficacious.

78
00:08:48,004 --> 00:08:51,055
Yes, at present only in snakes.

79
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:54,710
But there is something
you must see.

80
00:08:54,745 --> 00:08:56,735
Please?

81
00:08:57,234 --> 00:08:59,623
This is more like it.

82
00:09:05,502 --> 00:09:09,218
But tell me, what is it
that snakes have that we don't have?

83
00:09:09,253 --> 00:09:13,868
We still have not determined why
the extract is non-toxic in the snake...

84
00:09:13,903 --> 00:09:15,528
but lethal in humans.

85
00:09:15,563 --> 00:09:17,718
But you told me
you had made some progress.

86
00:09:17,753 --> 00:09:22,238
There has been. We've reduced
but not eliminated the toxicity.

87
00:09:22,273 --> 00:09:25,490
- In dogs and in chimpanzees.
- Even mice.

88
00:09:25,524 --> 00:09:28,014
Mice administered a steady dose
of the serum...

89
00:09:28,049 --> 00:09:31,635
show signs of a reduced rate
of aging.

90
00:09:33,096 --> 00:09:35,685
But ultimately, they die...

91
00:09:35,719 --> 00:09:39,471
from some mechanism
we don't fully understand.

92
00:09:42,194 --> 00:09:45,083
Mr. Murdoch, this is Darryl.

93
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:46,375
Hello, Darryl.

94
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:47,770
Nice to meet you, sir.

95
00:09:47,805 --> 00:09:50,961
- This way, sir.
- Impressive.

96
00:09:53,883 --> 00:09:55,974
Very impressive.

97
00:09:55,975 --> 00:09:57,965
Well, the bottom line, Mr. Murdoch...

98
00:09:57,989 --> 00:10:00,856
is that we've developed
a second-generation serum...

99
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:05,290
by producing a new strain
of the orchid.

100
00:10:05,325 --> 00:10:09,690
We hope to solve the problem
at the source.

101
00:10:09,725 --> 00:10:13,907
Behold the miracle
of modern science.

102
00:10:15,898 --> 00:10:19,119
Behold the miracle?
I can't see anything.

103
00:10:19,154 --> 00:10:23,636
We keep it dark to create an artificial
sleep cycle for the creature.

104
00:10:33,665 --> 00:10:35,955
Ugly son of a bitch, isn't it?

105
00:10:35,989 --> 00:10:37,349
What is that?

106
00:10:37,384 --> 00:10:40,670
It was a typical anaconda.

107
00:10:40,705 --> 00:10:42,997
It certainly isn't typical now.

108
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:57,940
- How's my baby doing today?
- He's hungry again.

109
00:10:58,171 --> 00:11:00,728
- What's the ambient temp of the cage?
- Sixty-five.

110
00:11:00,763 --> 00:11:02,385
Let's cosy it up five degrees.

111
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:04,512
And increase the cynanol mix
by 20 cc's.

112
00:11:04,547 --> 00:11:05,706
Okay.

113
00:11:05,741 --> 00:11:10,754
Are you telling me a regular dosage
of serum is what's produced this?

114
00:11:10,789 --> 00:11:12,910
For the most part,
we wanted to see...

115
00:11:12,944 --> 00:11:16,001
Amazing. Four months ago,
he could fit in a shoebox.

116
00:11:16,035 --> 00:11:17,958
That's probably how he feels
right now.

117
00:11:17,993 --> 00:11:19,252
Suits are here.

118
00:11:19,287 --> 00:11:21,877
Yeah, I know.
And I intend to find out why.

119
00:11:21,911 --> 00:11:23,967
In fact, quite the opposite.

120
00:11:24,002 --> 00:11:26,028
It's bigger, faster, stronger.

121
00:11:26,063 --> 00:11:28,051
And a hell of a lot meaner.

122
00:11:28,184 --> 00:11:31,935
We're making progress but we need
larger tanks and additional security.

123
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:35,290
- I was getting to that.
- Were you?

124
00:11:35,824 --> 00:11:39,441
Mr. Murdoch, our herpetologist,
Dr. Amanda Hayes.

125
00:11:39,476 --> 00:11:41,498
I've submitted four requests
to Pinkus.

126
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:44,089
And every time his answer is,
"It's not my call. "

127
00:11:44,124 --> 00:11:45,832
So whose call is it?

128
00:11:45,867 --> 00:11:47,541
Yours, Mr. Murdoch?

129
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,830
Please excuse Dr. Hayes.

130
00:11:49,865 --> 00:11:51,772
She's not familiar with the protocol.

131
00:11:51,807 --> 00:11:53,683
I'm very familiar with the protocol.

132
00:11:53,718 --> 00:11:55,176
I'm doing what you pay me for.

133
00:11:55,211 --> 00:11:59,260
Minding the well-being of our reptiles
and watching our asses.

134
00:11:59,658 --> 00:12:00,917
Dr. Hayes.

135
00:12:00,951 --> 00:12:03,042
You give me a marketable product...

136
00:12:03,077 --> 00:12:07,558
and I will buy you the biggest
animal park this side of the equator.

137
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:09,883
We need larger facilities now.

138
00:12:09,917 --> 00:12:11,108
I'll see what I can do.

139
00:12:11,143 --> 00:12:14,498
You have to do better than that.
You're not handling 60-foot snakes...

140
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:15,823
with massive appetites.

141
00:12:15,858 --> 00:12:19,841
We are understaffed
and in way over our heads.

142
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,977
What does she mean by that?

143
00:12:28,509 --> 00:12:33,587
If you'll excuse me, gentlemen,
I have some cultures to examine.

144
00:12:33,622 --> 00:12:35,511
Pinkus.

145
00:12:36,706 --> 00:12:38,897
- It's nothing.
- Nothing?

146
00:12:41,021 --> 00:12:44,805
I'm paying you an obscene amount of
money to keep this research on track.

147
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,825
It is clearly not on track.

148
00:12:47,859 --> 00:12:52,175
And my very expensive expert there
is concerned.

149
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:53,601
Money is not the problem.

150
00:12:53,636 --> 00:12:56,456
If we stopped every time we needed
to expand or upgrade...

151
00:12:56,491 --> 00:12:57,783
we'd be months behind.

152
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:01,867
Everything here is custom-made.
It takes time.

153
00:13:03,394 --> 00:13:06,713
And time is what I do not have.

154
00:13:09,036 --> 00:13:12,323
- Amanda? Excuse us.
- Sir? Sure.

155
00:13:12,754 --> 00:13:14,544
What is the matter with you?

156
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:18,464
I didn't go to med school
to serve a life sentence.

157
00:13:18,499 --> 00:13:20,289
It's just a means to an end.

158
00:13:20,323 --> 00:13:22,610
Whose end? For what?

159
00:13:22,645 --> 00:13:25,020
So some sick billionaire
can defeat death?

160
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,392
- What do you mean he's sick?
- Come on, Eric.

161
00:13:27,427 --> 00:13:28,651
You didn't see it?

162
00:13:28,686 --> 00:13:31,874
Pupils dilated, pale skin, coughing?

163
00:13:31,909 --> 00:13:34,827
Not to mention
his severe weight loss?

164
00:13:34,862 --> 00:13:37,881
It looks to me like he's got cancer,
which means he's dying.

165
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:39,774
Amanda.

166
00:13:39,808 --> 00:13:42,793
We're at the brink
of saving millions of lives.

167
00:13:42,828 --> 00:13:45,949
Can you imagine a drug, that could
revitalise cancer patients...

168
00:13:45,984 --> 00:13:47,906
and reverse Alzheimer's?

169
00:13:47,973 --> 00:13:50,563
Do you really still believe that?

170
00:13:50,598 --> 00:13:52,289
Don't you?

171
00:13:52,324 --> 00:13:53,946
I don't know.

172
00:13:53,981 --> 00:13:58,265
For something that's supposed to be
so good, why does it feel wrong?

173
00:13:58,299 --> 00:14:00,950
You knew what we were doing
when we started the research.

174
00:14:00,985 --> 00:14:04,471
Yeah, but I expected it to be handled
with more responsibility.

175
00:14:04,506 --> 00:14:07,357
We're tampering
with evolution, Eric.

176
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:11,675
Come on. It's just a big snake.

177
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:16,287
Yeah, well, that's definitely
an understatement.

178
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:19,940
- All right, I'll talk to you later, okay?
- Okay.

179
00:14:32,588 --> 00:14:34,843
Bigger, tougher, meaner, eh?

180
00:14:34,878 --> 00:14:37,003
I could use a bit of that.

181
00:14:37,038 --> 00:14:39,091
That's not a good idea, sir.

182
00:14:39,126 --> 00:14:41,781
You're telling me the serum
is responsible for this?

183
00:14:41,816 --> 00:14:46,260
Sir? Sir, turn that light off.

184
00:14:46,295 --> 00:14:47,820
Turn that light off.

185
00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:49,812
What the hell happened there?

186
00:14:50,774 --> 00:14:54,622
Pinkus? The warning lights in the tank
are starting to go crazy.

187
00:14:54,657 --> 00:14:57,214
- What's going on?
- I told you not to do that.

188
00:14:57,248 --> 00:14:58,770
- Hit the gas.
- What's going on?

189
00:14:58,804 --> 00:15:01,525
- What's going on?
- More lights are flashing.

190
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,848
There's a lot of movement.

191
00:15:04,578 --> 00:15:08,861
- Don't you touch that gas!
- Darryl, hit the goddamn gas!

192
00:15:08,895 --> 00:15:11,846
- You're gonna kill it.
- No, we're not killing-

193
00:15:11,881 --> 00:15:13,803
- Don't put the gas on.
- Please, Darryl!

194
00:15:13,837 --> 00:15:17,454
- Hit the goddamn gas. Sir. Sir.
- I won't let you kill it!

195
00:15:17,489 --> 00:15:19,578
Calm down.
It will only sedate the snake.

196
00:15:19,613 --> 00:15:20,939
Don't you tell me what-

197
00:15:20,974 --> 00:15:23,594
- Darryl! Darryl?
- What's happening?

198
00:15:23,629 --> 00:15:25,020
- What's happening?
- Darryl-

199
00:15:25,055 --> 00:15:29,204
Look, look. Don't worry, Mr. Murdoch.
That's three-inch polycarbonate glass.

200
00:15:29,239 --> 00:15:30,994
Well, it's not enough.

201
00:15:33,284 --> 00:15:35,773
- What's it doing?
- Everybody, just stay calm.

202
00:15:35,808 --> 00:15:38,328
- The gas will sedate it.
- Are you sure?

203
00:15:38,363 --> 00:15:41,117
He'll settle down, I'm sure.

204
00:15:43,738 --> 00:15:46,393
Everybody calm down.

205
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:53,395
It's fine.

206
00:15:54,424 --> 00:15:56,246
Finally.

207
00:15:56,281 --> 00:15:59,071
Now let's just leave him be.

208
00:15:59,105 --> 00:16:01,059
Darryl, call Kane.

209
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:02,551
Let him know what happened.

210
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:06,104
I'll call the technicians
to get this repaired.

211
00:16:09,522 --> 00:16:13,472
- Darryl. Hit the alarm. Lock us down.
- Hit the alarm! Hit the alarm!

212
00:16:13,507 --> 00:16:15,862
Loading results-

213
00:16:17,955 --> 00:16:19,315
Everyone outside.

214
00:16:19,316 --> 00:16:21,455
Stay calm. Everyone outside.
Let's go.

215
00:16:21,456 --> 00:16:23,406
- We're safe.
- We gotta help him.

216
00:16:23,407 --> 00:16:25,288
- What? Screw him.
- He's my friend.

217
00:16:25,289 --> 00:16:28,141
- There's a monster out there!
- I've got to help him!

218
00:16:28,142 --> 00:16:30,828
If the snake doesn't get you,
the gas will!

219
00:16:30,829 --> 00:16:32,855
Now, shut up!

220
00:16:34,844 --> 00:16:36,900
Oh, my God.

221
00:16:36,901 --> 00:16:38,825
- What happened?
- What do you think?

222
00:16:38,826 --> 00:16:40,716
What the hell did you do?
Where's Darryl?

223
00:16:40,717 --> 00:16:43,208
Darryl didn't make it.

224
00:16:43,538 --> 00:16:45,825
We've gotta go. Let's go.

225
00:16:45,826 --> 00:16:49,144
- You said the gas would knock it out.
- He's looking for a way out.

226
00:16:49,145 --> 00:16:51,734
We have to contain him.
Security, lockdown.

227
00:16:51,735 --> 00:16:53,540
- Full lockdown.
- Yes, sir.

228
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,783
I'm locking down right now.

229
00:16:56,443 --> 00:16:57,770
Amanda, get the guns.

230
00:16:57,771 --> 00:17:01,125
Hey, hey, hey.
Where do you think you're going?

231
00:17:02,252 --> 00:17:05,137
- I'm getting Murdoch out of here.
- Nobody's going anywhere.

232
00:17:05,138 --> 00:17:07,595
Grab a gun!

233
00:17:11,143 --> 00:17:13,861
- No way. I'm getting out of here.
- Pinkus.

234
00:17:13,862 --> 00:17:15,985
Take the gun!

235
00:17:15,986 --> 00:17:17,280
This is not a drill.

236
00:17:17,281 --> 00:17:22,889
All personnel should exit immediately
to your designated safety zone.

237
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,210
This is not a drill.

238
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:28,397
- The sedatives must have taken effect.
- Are you sure?

239
00:17:28,398 --> 00:17:32,077
Yeah.
That stuff would knock out 10 rhinos.

240
00:17:32,078 --> 00:17:34,834
It's a stun gas.
It will only last for five minutes.

241
00:17:34,835 --> 00:17:36,956
We don't have time. Get the masks.

242
00:17:36,957 --> 00:17:40,574
Pinkus?
Escort Mr. Murdoch out of here.

243
00:17:40,638 --> 00:17:43,277
Yeah. Yeah. Sir?

244
00:17:43,278 --> 00:17:45,847
This is not a drill.

245
00:17:46,848 --> 00:17:52,257
All personnel should exit immediately
to your designated safety zone.

246
00:17:54,312 --> 00:17:56,137
- Get out.
- This is not a drill.

247
00:17:56,138 --> 00:18:00,417
All personnel should exit immediately
to your designated safety zone.

248
00:18:00,418 --> 00:18:03,701
- Have you seen Janet? Is she outside?
- She's already gone.

249
00:18:03,702 --> 00:18:05,324
This is not a drill.

250
00:18:05,325 --> 00:18:09,971
All personnel should exit immediately
to your designated safety zone.

251
00:18:12,855 --> 00:18:14,713
This is not a drill.

252
00:18:14,714 --> 00:18:20,421
All personnel should exit immediately
to your designated safety zone.

253
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,033
This is not a drill.

254
00:18:24,034 --> 00:18:29,643
All personnel should exit immediately
to your designated safety zone.

255
00:18:31,963 --> 00:18:35,081
This is not a drill.

256
00:18:35,178 --> 00:18:37,254
This is not a drill.

257
00:18:37,255 --> 00:18:39,759
All personnel...

258
00:18:44,699 --> 00:18:45,925
This is not a drill.

259
00:18:45,926 --> 00:18:50,240
All personnel should exit immediately
to your designated safety zone.

260
00:18:50,441 --> 00:18:52,762
Okay.

261
00:18:53,192 --> 00:18:54,683
Oh, God.

262
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:56,809
- It's Darryl.
- All personnel should exit...

263
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:59,231
to your designated safety zone.

264
00:18:59,432 --> 00:19:01,583
- Are you okay?
- Come on.

265
00:19:01,784 --> 00:19:03,937
- Let's get through this.
- This is not a drill.

266
00:19:04,138 --> 00:19:06,727
All personnel should exit
to your designated safety zone.

267
00:19:06,928 --> 00:19:08,584
Where is it?

268
00:19:08,785 --> 00:19:10,872
Over here?

269
00:19:11,635 --> 00:19:13,594
This is not a drill.

270
00:19:13,595 --> 00:19:15,717
- All personnel should exit...
- Where is it?

271
00:19:15,718 --> 00:19:18,236
to your designated safety zone.

272
00:19:18,237 --> 00:19:19,829
Oh, God.

273
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,520
He's not in here.

274
00:19:21,521 --> 00:19:23,578
- Where would he go?
- I don't know.

275
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,607
But we better find it fast.

276
00:19:25,608 --> 00:19:27,645
He's gone after the queen.

277
00:19:27,646 --> 00:19:30,116
- Let's go.
- Come on.

278
00:19:31,509 --> 00:19:34,594
This is not a drill. All personnel-

279
00:19:37,178 --> 00:19:41,191
How are we gonna explain
that one, huh, Pinkus?

280
00:19:41,192 --> 00:19:43,878
Don't tell me you haven't got
a backup lighting system.

281
00:19:43,879 --> 00:19:45,270
Please don't tell me.

282
00:19:45,271 --> 00:19:46,961
It should come on in a minute.

283
00:19:46,962 --> 00:19:50,512
Let's get out of here quickly.
Quickly.

284
00:19:50,743 --> 00:19:53,565
Oh, God.

285
00:20:10,905 --> 00:20:12,629
Oh, God.

286
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:15,019
I hate when you're right.

287
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,939
So do I.

288
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,069
Susan.

289
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:46,161
Oh, no. She's gone.

290
00:20:56,572 --> 00:20:59,557
He broke her out.

291
00:21:01,449 --> 00:21:04,567
This is all my fault.

292
00:21:08,411 --> 00:21:11,864
Run!

293
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:31,594
Have you any idea
what this is gonna cost to cover up?

294
00:22:31,595 --> 00:22:32,821
Yes. No.

295
00:22:32,822 --> 00:22:34,495
I mean, yes. I know exactly...

296
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,840
I want this place cleaned!

297
00:22:36,841 --> 00:22:39,117
I want it cleaned properly.

298
00:22:39,118 --> 00:22:44,024
Sir? Might I advise
that we can still salvage this situation?

299
00:22:44,025 --> 00:22:45,647
On-site security team is here.

300
00:22:45,648 --> 00:22:48,401
We have a team of professional
trackers on their way.

301
00:22:48,402 --> 00:22:50,453
You'll do whatever you have to do.

302
00:22:50,454 --> 00:22:53,404
But you will be with them
24 hours a day.

303
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:56,322
- What do you mean, sir?
- You're a supervisor, Pinkus.

304
00:22:56,323 --> 00:22:57,778
Supervise.

305
00:22:57,779 --> 00:23:01,263
Otherwise, I will have them
test that serum on you.

306
00:23:04,606 --> 00:23:06,630
But, sir, I don't do field work.

307
00:23:06,631 --> 00:23:08,936
I want news, Pinkus.

308
00:23:08,937 --> 00:23:11,203
- Good news.
- Pinkus.

309
00:23:11,204 --> 00:23:13,227
Name's Grozny.

310
00:23:19,158 --> 00:23:23,632
Until I hear good news,
you will report to me hourly.

311
00:23:23,633 --> 00:23:25,758
Yes, sir.

312
00:23:27,941 --> 00:23:29,681
Grozny.

313
00:23:29,682 --> 00:23:31,356
Follow me.

314
00:23:31,357 --> 00:23:34,673
I'll brief you on the situation.

315
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:47,795
Come on, guys.
It took five shots to bring them down.

316
00:23:47,796 --> 00:23:50,785
We'll give you 20 at market rate.

317
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:55,987
Look, guys. I don't care
what kinky plans you're into.

318
00:23:55,988 --> 00:23:59,286
But these are 5-pound
Java rhino horns.

319
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:02,583
So I suggest you go
to an ATM teller.

320
00:24:02,584 --> 00:24:05,497
One that dispenses some respect.

321
00:24:05,498 --> 00:24:08,283
Thirty thousand or nothing.

322
00:24:18,026 --> 00:24:20,048
Deal.

323
00:24:27,601 --> 00:24:31,247
Always a pleasure.

324
00:24:32,672 --> 00:24:35,092
Pleasure.

325
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:40,125
Give us the envelope.

326
00:24:40,126 --> 00:24:44,301
Okay. I got $30,000
in crisp American bills.

327
00:24:44,302 --> 00:24:47,252
Now, if you want euros you'll have
to go to Greece or a bank.

328
00:24:47,253 --> 00:24:49,274
I get them confused.

329
00:24:50,931 --> 00:24:54,211
I'm- Hang on.

330
00:24:55,435 --> 00:24:58,517
Yeah? Pinkus?

331
00:24:58,518 --> 00:25:00,372
I'm a little busy right now.

332
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:02,295
What?

333
00:25:02,296 --> 00:25:03,982
Oh, let me guess.

334
00:25:03,983 --> 00:25:07,959
You didn't reinforce the cages
and the snakes got out.

335
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,218
This is serious.

336
00:25:09,219 --> 00:25:12,171
We are prepared to pay
and I need you here to lead the team.

337
00:25:12,172 --> 00:25:15,024
Yeah. I'll be there as soon as I can.

338
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:18,864
What? What?

339
00:25:18,865 --> 00:25:21,546
- What's your name?
- Florin.

340
00:25:21,547 --> 00:25:23,070
Florin?

341
00:25:23,071 --> 00:25:25,560
- It's for you.
- What?

342
00:25:37,422 --> 00:25:41,102
Always know the animal
before the hunt.

343
00:26:02,444 --> 00:26:05,126
These creatures are one of a kind.

344
00:26:05,127 --> 00:26:08,109
- Growing to become 60 feet long.
- Sixty-foot snakes?

345
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:10,926
- I've got one of those.
- Dreamer.

346
00:26:10,927 --> 00:26:13,444
Please!

347
00:26:14,538 --> 00:26:17,681
They are fast and very strong.

348
00:26:17,682 --> 00:26:22,953
Having never dealt with anything like
this, I urge you to use extreme caution.

349
00:26:22,954 --> 00:26:24,540
We must bring them down.

350
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,361
It is imperative.

351
00:26:26,362 --> 00:26:29,908
- And they are more than 60 feet-
- Thank you, Dr. Hayes.

352
00:26:29,909 --> 00:26:31,630
I will handle this briefing.

353
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:35,027
My team know these woods
like our own backyard.

354
00:26:35,028 --> 00:26:38,299
It's easier than that.
We also know their location.

355
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:41,536
We try and keep a short leash
on our investments.

356
00:26:41,537 --> 00:26:42,962
In case of emergencies.

357
00:26:42,963 --> 00:26:44,348
We're moving out in 10.

358
00:26:44,349 --> 00:26:46,372
Hammett's on his way.
We should wait.

359
00:26:46,373 --> 00:26:49,386
We're not waiting. Not when we know
where the snakes are.

360
00:26:49,387 --> 00:26:51,173
We need to strike fast.

361
00:26:51,174 --> 00:26:54,820
Like I said, we move out in 10.

362
00:26:55,821 --> 00:26:58,139
- Man, he wants all the glory.
- You're right.

363
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,993
You know how he feels
about Hammett.

364
00:26:59,994 --> 00:27:01,348
- Yep.
- You heard the man.

365
00:27:01,349 --> 00:27:03,039
Ten minutes.

366
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,055
I need to speak with you privately.

367
00:27:08,109 --> 00:27:10,158
Why haven't you called
the government?

368
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,414
The company
is handling this matter privately.

369
00:27:12,415 --> 00:27:14,597
Company has no idea
what we're dealing with.

370
00:27:14,598 --> 00:27:18,604
Do I need to remind you that you
signed a strict confidentiality contract?

371
00:27:18,605 --> 00:27:21,222
There are innocent people
that need to be warned.

372
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:24,698
Our professionals will resolve
this matter swiftly and efficiently.

373
00:27:24,699 --> 00:27:27,281
And as for you,
take this as a friendly warning.

374
00:27:27,282 --> 00:27:28,737
Do not interfere.

375
00:27:28,738 --> 00:27:30,858
I am responsible for those animals.

376
00:27:30,859 --> 00:27:32,910
Nobody knows their behaviour
better than me.

377
00:27:32,911 --> 00:27:36,489
Those snakes aren't gonna bask
in the sun and roll over for you.

378
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:39,539
I'm coming with you.

379
00:27:45,763 --> 00:27:49,074
You're not the one handling 60-foot
snakes with massive appetites.

380
00:27:49,075 --> 00:27:53,544
we are understaffed
and in way over our heads.

381
00:27:53,576 --> 00:27:56,690
Can you imagine a drug
that could revitalise cancer patients...

382
00:27:56,691 --> 00:27:58,811
and reverse Alzheimer's?

383
00:27:58,812 --> 00:28:00,895
Do you really believe that?

384
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:02,418
Don't you?

385
00:28:02,419 --> 00:28:04,406
Please excuse Dr. Hayes.

386
00:28:04,407 --> 00:28:07,325
She's not familiar with the protocol.

387
00:28:12,754 --> 00:28:15,304
Miss Hayes?

388
00:28:15,305 --> 00:28:17,226
Miss Hayes?

389
00:28:17,227 --> 00:28:18,880
Yeah?

390
00:28:18,881 --> 00:28:22,096
You like travelling light?

391
00:28:22,457 --> 00:28:25,671
I don't think
I'd feel really comfortable with that.

392
00:28:25,672 --> 00:28:27,257
It would make you comfortable...

393
00:28:27,258 --> 00:28:30,208
if you came face to face
with a 60-foot snake.

394
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:33,123
I already have, remember?
I helped create them.

395
00:28:33,124 --> 00:28:35,291
Besides,
that's why you guys are here.

396
00:28:35,292 --> 00:28:37,428
I'm giving you
the best chance to survive.

397
00:28:37,429 --> 00:28:39,544
It's no problem, Amanda.

398
00:28:39,545 --> 00:28:41,636
Just stick with Nick.

399
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:43,353
Nick?

400
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:46,668
Introduce her to the bazooka.

401
00:28:48,289 --> 00:28:51,107
The bazooka.

402
00:28:51,403 --> 00:28:55,644
Twenty-four knockouts,
regional city champ.

403
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:08,270
Can I see that gun again?

404
00:29:17,802 --> 00:29:19,953
Oh, sorry.

405
00:29:24,883 --> 00:29:26,872
You know, Dragosh...

406
00:29:26,873 --> 00:29:29,755
they say you should never look them
in the eyes.

407
00:29:29,956 --> 00:29:31,143
And? What else?

408
00:29:31,444 --> 00:29:34,456
They have the powers
of mesmerising.

409
00:29:34,986 --> 00:29:37,729
- That's bull.
- No, no, no, it's true.

410
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:43,032
I heard a story of a hunter who stared
in the eyes of the anaconda too long.

411
00:29:43,433 --> 00:29:47,336
Suddenly, he was hypnotised.

412
00:29:47,837 --> 00:29:50,615
It swallowed him alive.

413
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,889
You want me to stuff this rifle
down your throat?

414
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:57,602
Don't be an ass, Andrei.
You know he's afraid of snakes.

415
00:29:57,603 --> 00:30:01,012
I'm not afraid of snakes.
I just don't like them.

416
00:30:01,013 --> 00:30:04,323
You don't have to like them.
You just have to like killing them.

417
00:30:04,324 --> 00:30:06,936
I'm fine with that.

418
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,918
Damn wolves!

419
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,179
We're close.

420
00:35:25,765 --> 00:35:29,107
- Got it.
- Follow them.

421
00:35:57,304 --> 00:35:59,420
Well, the signal's coming
from around here.

422
00:35:59,421 --> 00:36:02,261
It could be anywhere
within 100 yards.

423
00:36:02,262 --> 00:36:05,998
These bastards detect heat,
so you're always prone to attack.

424
00:36:05,999 --> 00:36:08,315
Don't forget that.

425
00:36:09,603 --> 00:36:13,205
Nick? Andrei? See who's home.

426
00:36:13,305 --> 00:36:15,174
- Dragosh, check the barn.
- All right.

427
00:36:15,175 --> 00:36:17,007
- You two, around the back.
- Let's go.

428
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,324
Come on. Let's go.

429
00:36:19,651 --> 00:36:23,787
- What about us?
- Mr. Pinkus. Miss Hayes.

430
00:36:23,788 --> 00:36:25,602
Stay put.

431
00:36:25,603 --> 00:36:29,041
- If they were here, you'd see evidence.
- Yeah, you're absolutely right.

432
00:36:29,042 --> 00:36:30,989
That's why we're looking around.

433
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:32,810
Grozny.

434
00:36:32,811 --> 00:36:35,124
You may need this.

435
00:36:36,546 --> 00:36:39,025
Thanks.

436
00:36:43,642 --> 00:36:47,323
Hello? Anybody home?

437
00:36:48,782 --> 00:36:52,435
- Hello?
- Try the door.

438
00:36:55,515 --> 00:36:57,489
It's not locked.

439
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:59,895
Why would it be?

440
00:37:31,269 --> 00:37:34,820
It's like Little House on the Prairie.

441
00:37:46,654 --> 00:37:49,644
Let's check around the back.

442
00:37:55,047 --> 00:37:56,936
I'm...

443
00:37:56,937 --> 00:38:00,952
sorry about the professor.

444
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:04,332
He was a good man.

445
00:38:04,333 --> 00:38:05,724
Yeah, thanks.

446
00:38:05,725 --> 00:38:08,679
Dragosh, it's reading. We're close.

447
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:11,366
Keep your eyes peeled.

448
00:38:13,653 --> 00:38:16,441
All clear.

449
00:38:16,506 --> 00:38:20,055
Listen, I'm going in.
I can't wait anymore.

450
00:38:21,187 --> 00:38:23,077
You go around back, I'll take front.

451
00:38:23,078 --> 00:38:25,397
Okay.

452
00:38:25,726 --> 00:38:28,416
Go check over there.

453
00:38:48,668 --> 00:38:50,491
Hey, better safe than sorry, huh?

454
00:38:50,492 --> 00:38:52,650
Be vigilant, guys.
We know it's nearby.

455
00:38:52,651 --> 00:38:56,299
Come on, guys. It's 60 feet long.

456
00:38:57,092 --> 00:39:00,709
The place is deserted,
maybe they went out for supplies.

457
00:39:06,341 --> 00:39:09,327
That's slightly disturbing.

458
00:39:12,513 --> 00:39:13,904
What happened to it?

459
00:39:13,905 --> 00:39:17,516
When they don't like a meal
they spit it back up.

460
00:39:17,517 --> 00:39:19,808
I'd eat it.

461
00:39:21,261 --> 00:39:23,681
Come on, guys. It's just a goat.

462
00:39:23,682 --> 00:39:26,931
If these beasts only eat things
that look good...

463
00:39:26,932 --> 00:39:30,144
if I were you Miss Hayes,
I'd be very careful.

464
00:39:30,145 --> 00:39:31,305
Excuse me?

465
00:39:31,306 --> 00:39:34,420
I hate to interrupt,
but we got a job to do.

466
00:39:34,421 --> 00:39:37,106
Over here.

467
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:40,087
Dragosh, Victor, stay here.

468
00:39:40,088 --> 00:39:42,706
Andrei, hang back.

469
00:40:03,718 --> 00:40:06,006
That makes things
a little more difficult.

470
00:40:06,007 --> 00:40:09,980
- Tight leash, isn't that what you said?
- Let's put Plan B into effect.

471
00:40:09,981 --> 00:40:11,572
And what might that be?

472
00:40:11,573 --> 00:40:13,958
I don't know yet.

473
00:40:13,959 --> 00:40:16,974
I don't understand
how it sheds so quickly.

474
00:40:16,975 --> 00:40:20,619
Ecdysis. It only happens when
the snake grows too large for its skin.

475
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:23,738
Which means
it's growing pretty damn fast.

476
00:40:26,788 --> 00:40:30,863
All right. Victor, I want you
to start putting the supplies in order.

477
00:40:30,864 --> 00:40:33,253
Dragosh, set up a lookout
around here.

478
00:40:33,254 --> 00:40:34,707
Andrei, around the back.

479
00:40:34,708 --> 00:40:37,262
Nick?

480
00:40:45,507 --> 00:40:48,660
Oh, God! No!

481
00:40:49,945 --> 00:40:53,589
Get him! Go! Go!

482
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:56,145
Get it!

483
00:40:57,202 --> 00:40:59,723
Over there! Outside!

484
00:41:04,455 --> 00:41:07,273
Go! Go!

485
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:12,973
Take that, you son of a bitch.

486
00:41:12,974 --> 00:41:14,129
Go! Go! Go!

487
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:16,885
- Come on. Come on.
- Go. Go.

488
00:41:17,841 --> 00:41:20,362
- Get something. Check the jeep.
- There it is.

489
00:41:20,363 --> 00:41:23,476
Quick! Get my bag.

490
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:29,437
Get it!

491
00:41:29,438 --> 00:41:32,058
How is he?

492
00:41:35,302 --> 00:41:37,589
Dragosh!

493
00:41:57,532 --> 00:42:00,220
Cease fire! Cease fire!

494
00:42:00,743 --> 00:42:03,066
Amanda, help Grozny.

495
00:42:03,067 --> 00:42:06,809
Pinkus, in Grozny's jeep
there's a fire extinguisher.

496
00:42:08,961 --> 00:42:11,746
The rest of you follow me.
We end this now.

497
00:42:11,747 --> 00:42:12,901
Come on.

498
00:42:12,902 --> 00:42:15,587
- Let's go. Come on.
- Right.

499
00:42:15,588 --> 00:42:18,240
Fire extinguisher.

500
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:20,526
Hurry up!

501
00:42:29,343 --> 00:42:31,628
Stop!

502
00:42:31,692 --> 00:42:35,009
- What?
- Sofia. Andrei.

503
00:42:35,702 --> 00:42:38,087
Victor.

504
00:42:38,285 --> 00:42:40,353
Hurry up! Hurry up! Come on!

505
00:42:40,354 --> 00:42:42,392
- Get my bag!
- Where is it?

506
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,308
- Hurry up!
- What?

507
00:42:44,309 --> 00:42:47,461
- Come on!
- Just a sec- I'm coming.

508
00:42:47,462 --> 00:42:49,012
Open it up. Quick.

509
00:42:49,013 --> 00:42:50,537
- Hurry!
- Okay. Hold on.

510
00:42:50,538 --> 00:42:52,357
- I don't know which-
- Hold him down.

511
00:42:52,358 --> 00:42:53,519
Give me the elastic.

512
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,209
- There.
- No, the elastic.

513
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:56,827
I don't know. I don't know.

514
00:42:56,828 --> 00:42:58,685
- Give me the elastic.
- There, there.

515
00:42:58,686 --> 00:43:00,338
Now hold him down.
Hold him down.

516
00:43:00,339 --> 00:43:02,790
- Pinch this artery.
- I don't know what I'm doing.

517
00:43:02,791 --> 00:43:05,507
Pinch off his artery. Hang in there!

518
00:43:05,508 --> 00:43:08,123
I don't know what I'm doing, Amanda.
I don't know.

519
00:43:08,124 --> 00:43:09,929
Just put pressure and don't let go.

520
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:11,699
- Right here. Don't let go.
- Okay.

521
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:14,813
- Okay?
- It's okay, Grozny.

522
00:43:38,227 --> 00:43:42,233
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

523
00:43:42,298 --> 00:43:44,849
Where are you?

524
00:43:49,915 --> 00:43:52,896
Where are you hiding, huh?

525
00:43:56,042 --> 00:43:58,595
Come on.

526
00:44:00,421 --> 00:44:02,172
- I see it.
- Where? Where?

527
00:44:02,173 --> 00:44:04,724
Twelve o'clock.

528
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:07,113
Got it.

529
00:44:35,609 --> 00:44:38,094
There.

530
00:44:40,706 --> 00:44:43,026
- Damn, it's big.
- Let's go!

531
00:44:43,027 --> 00:44:44,959
Sofia!

532
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,329
Sofia!

533
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,353
Come on.

534
00:44:53,354 --> 00:44:56,269
Got something for you.

535
00:45:03,249 --> 00:45:05,799
That's not good.

536
00:45:07,396 --> 00:45:09,249
- Put pressure!
- I don't feel a pulse!

537
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:11,996
- He doesn't have a pulse. It's over!
- Shut the hell up!

538
00:45:11,997 --> 00:45:13,781
Amanda, he is gone!

539
00:45:13,782 --> 00:45:16,531
- Shut the hell up. Just put-
- Amanda, it's over!

540
00:45:16,532 --> 00:45:19,175
No. Come on. Come on.

541
00:45:19,176 --> 00:45:21,789
Amanda, he's dead.

542
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:23,861
Come on.

543
00:45:23,862 --> 00:45:26,359
Come on.

544
00:46:30,417 --> 00:46:32,072
Victor.

545
00:46:32,073 --> 00:46:34,159
Come on.

546
00:47:03,175 --> 00:47:06,059
Don't move.

547
00:47:28,796 --> 00:47:30,983
You take the cake
for leaving without me.

548
00:47:30,984 --> 00:47:32,332
It wasn't my idea.

549
00:47:32,633 --> 00:47:34,653
- We have to kill it.
- Take it easy!

550
00:47:34,654 --> 00:47:36,670
What do you wanna do?
Grab it by the tail?

551
00:47:36,671 --> 00:47:39,614
- We're gonna find this thing. Relax.
- It's about time, Hammett.

552
00:47:39,615 --> 00:47:42,625
Good to see you too, Nick.
Come on. Gather around.

553
00:47:43,126 --> 00:47:44,943
- We gotta make a plan.
- Hammett.

554
00:47:44,944 --> 00:47:46,964
- Hammett.
- Andrei, get the steel case...

555
00:47:46,965 --> 00:47:48,250
in the back of my car.

556
00:47:48,251 --> 00:47:51,292
All right. Listen up, guys.
We've all worked together before.

557
00:47:51,293 --> 00:47:52,514
Simple rules, okay?

558
00:47:52,515 --> 00:47:56,879
Once you see this thing, you unload
everything until it stops moving.

559
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,894
And you shoot only for the head.

560
00:47:58,895 --> 00:48:01,078
Nothing else
will bring this thing down.

561
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:04,087
Follow my lead, I'll take you up
this snake's ass. Let's go.

562
00:48:04,088 --> 00:48:05,543
What's that?

563
00:48:05,544 --> 00:48:06,896
It's a tracking device.

564
00:48:06,897 --> 00:48:09,758
Victor, you, Sofie,
Amanda in the jeep.

565
00:48:09,793 --> 00:48:12,618
Nick, Pinkus,
you're with me and Andrei.

566
00:48:14,633 --> 00:48:17,281
- I think I'll stay here.
- Suit yourself.

567
00:48:17,282 --> 00:48:20,354
But you're gonna miss
all the excitement.

568
00:49:08,589 --> 00:49:12,988
We're getting close.
The signal is becoming stronger.

569
00:49:19,466 --> 00:49:21,319
There!

570
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:22,605
Come on!

571
00:49:22,606 --> 00:49:23,964
Don't lose it.

572
00:49:23,965 --> 00:49:26,042
We're almost there.

573
00:49:26,043 --> 00:49:28,491
- Stay with them.
- I am!

574
00:49:28,492 --> 00:49:30,645
Come on!

575
00:49:33,353 --> 00:49:36,169
This way. Quick.

576
00:49:36,656 --> 00:49:39,901
We got it. I repeat, we got it.
Stay on it!

577
00:49:39,902 --> 00:49:42,514
- I am trying.
- Try harder.

578
00:49:45,625 --> 00:49:48,980
Andrei, lose the tracker.
We're onto him now.

579
00:49:48,981 --> 00:49:52,766
It's the end of the line
for these bastards.

580
00:50:04,696 --> 00:50:07,702
Damn it, try to keep this car steady.

581
00:50:16,621 --> 00:50:18,045
- You okay?
- Thanks.

582
00:50:18,046 --> 00:50:20,721
Don't mention it.

583
00:50:30,834 --> 00:50:34,734
How is that possible?

584
00:50:39,491 --> 00:50:41,472
It's burning!

585
00:50:41,473 --> 00:50:43,223
- It just spit on my face.
- You okay?

586
00:50:43,224 --> 00:50:45,408
- Cover your eye. Go!
- Where is he?

587
00:50:47,191 --> 00:50:49,934
Drive, quick.

588
00:50:49,935 --> 00:50:52,808
- Where is he?
- Go left. Go.

589
00:50:52,809 --> 00:50:55,587
It's burning.

590
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:13,529
I think my leg is broken. My leg.

591
00:51:23,684 --> 00:51:25,546
Victor?

592
00:51:25,547 --> 00:51:27,842
Victor.

593
00:51:27,843 --> 00:51:29,954
Victor.

594
00:51:29,955 --> 00:51:31,626
Oh, God.

595
00:51:31,827 --> 00:51:33,217
Sofia?

596
00:51:33,518 --> 00:51:35,243
Sofia.

597
00:51:36,438 --> 00:51:38,444
- Amanda?
- Do you see him?

598
00:51:38,745 --> 00:51:41,912
Amanda, I think my leg is broken.

599
00:51:41,913 --> 00:51:46,013
Okay. Okay. I'm coming.

600
00:51:47,532 --> 00:51:49,810
My leg.

601
00:52:13,425 --> 00:52:15,241
Amanda.

602
00:52:15,542 --> 00:52:18,612
Amanda. You all right?

603
00:52:18,913 --> 00:52:22,413
- Amanda.
- Hammett.

604
00:52:24,230 --> 00:52:26,406
Hammett.

605
00:52:30,536 --> 00:52:32,654
Hammett.

606
00:52:42,433 --> 00:52:46,396
Oh, my God. No, no, no.

607
00:52:55,243 --> 00:53:00,130
Oh, God, just get me out of here.
Please.

608
00:53:02,974 --> 00:53:04,986
No.

609
00:54:20,279 --> 00:54:22,192
Hey, hey, hey. It's okay. It's okay.

610
00:54:22,193 --> 00:54:24,035
He didn't see me.
It must be the mud.

611
00:54:24,036 --> 00:54:26,248
- He couldn't sense me.
- Where are the others?

612
00:54:26,249 --> 00:54:27,857
- They're dead.
- All right.

613
00:54:27,858 --> 00:54:31,487
Let's catch up with Nick and Andrei.
You'll be all right.

614
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:06,135
What have I done?

615
00:55:17,674 --> 00:55:21,069
I don't know what's going on. Murdoch
called and said I should be here.

616
00:55:21,070 --> 00:55:24,166
- I have no idea why he didn't call.
- Do you think it's possible?

617
00:55:24,167 --> 00:55:25,320
Is what possible?

618
00:55:25,321 --> 00:55:28,090
- Amanda-
- What's going on?

619
00:55:28,417 --> 00:55:30,890
- Nothing.
- Oh, really.

620
00:55:30,891 --> 00:55:33,165
Like you guys are here
discussing the weather.

621
00:55:33,166 --> 00:55:35,604
You wanna give us a moment.

622
00:55:35,605 --> 00:55:37,984
Gladly.

623
00:55:40,976 --> 00:55:42,296
What?

624
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:45,861
We were discussing the possibilities
of bringing this creature down.

625
00:55:45,862 --> 00:55:48,428
Oh, really?
How come I don't believe you?

626
00:55:48,429 --> 00:55:50,109
You don't even know me.

627
00:55:50,110 --> 00:55:53,342
I've worked with Pinkus enough
to know he's always got an agenda.

628
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:56,537
When I see someone I don't trust
talking to another I don't trust...

629
00:55:56,538 --> 00:55:58,863
I don't get all warm and fuzzy
inside.

630
00:55:58,864 --> 00:56:01,616
That's where the whisky
comes in, darling.

631
00:56:07,033 --> 00:56:10,924
You two vipers can talk business all
you want. I'm gonna go call the Army.

632
00:56:10,925 --> 00:56:13,491
Damn, you sure are hot
when you're making threats.

633
00:56:13,492 --> 00:56:16,192
I'm not making any threats.
I'm gonna go call the Army.

634
00:56:16,193 --> 00:56:17,840
She's hiding something big.

635
00:56:17,841 --> 00:56:20,375
- Yeah, the Army.
- What do you mean?

636
00:56:20,376 --> 00:56:22,616
I'm not sure
but she knows something.

637
00:56:22,617 --> 00:56:24,890
- Your fault.
- My fault? I don't think so.

638
00:56:24,891 --> 00:56:28,088
- I got a bad feeling about her.
- Let's find out what it is.

639
00:56:28,089 --> 00:56:30,592
I may not have a fancy Ph. D.,
but I know one thing.

640
00:56:30,593 --> 00:56:36,489
There ain't a snake on this planet
that can skewer people with its tail.

641
00:56:36,521 --> 00:56:38,578
We weren't expecting
this much trouble.

642
00:56:38,613 --> 00:56:40,636
- Really?
- What are you two discussing?

643
00:56:40,637 --> 00:56:45,121
Yeah, Amanda, why don't you
tell them. What were we discussing?

644
00:56:47,528 --> 00:56:49,037
A serum.

645
00:56:49,038 --> 00:56:50,984
Okay. We gave it a serum.

646
00:56:50,985 --> 00:56:52,896
Sort of a DNA tune-up.

647
00:56:53,397 --> 00:56:55,238
Transgenics.

648
00:56:56,987 --> 00:56:59,779
Snakes are the only animals
that can tolerate the new serum.

649
00:56:59,981 --> 00:57:01,728
We had to find out why.

650
00:57:01,929 --> 00:57:03,602
So we altered its DNA...

651
00:57:03,903 --> 00:57:07,674
in an attempt to isolate the gene
that makes it immune to toxicity.

652
00:57:07,975 --> 00:57:12,175
And the enormous size of the spike
in the tail is because of the drugs?

653
00:57:14,963 --> 00:57:18,023
- We believe the serum is responsible.
- Well done, doctor.

654
00:57:18,024 --> 00:57:21,048
Do you think I intended this?
We were developing a drug...

655
00:57:21,049 --> 00:57:24,109
- that would save lives.
- I think you failed there.

656
00:57:24,110 --> 00:57:28,618
No, no. We didn't fail. We were
on the cusp of a breakthrough.

657
00:57:29,504 --> 00:57:31,874
But there's a reason
why I came along.

658
00:57:31,875 --> 00:57:33,652
I don't like where this is going.

659
00:57:33,653 --> 00:57:36,874
I don't know
how it could get any worse.

660
00:57:36,875 --> 00:57:39,481
She's pregnant.

661
00:57:39,970 --> 00:57:42,012
I was wrong.

662
00:57:42,013 --> 00:57:45,436
- The female is about to give birth.
- When?

663
00:57:45,832 --> 00:57:48,723
In less than 24 hours, if not sooner.

664
00:57:48,724 --> 00:57:50,733
Normal little snakes, right?

665
00:57:50,734 --> 00:57:51,917
Like the black one.

666
00:57:51,918 --> 00:57:54,285
Why the hell would you allow
something like that?

667
00:57:54,286 --> 00:57:58,398
For research. The offspring would put
us closer to perfecting the serum.

668
00:57:58,399 --> 00:58:02,483
Serum. And just what was this serum
supposed to do besides wreak havoc?

669
00:58:02,484 --> 00:58:06,133
A giant step towards the cure
for cancer and Alzheimer's disease.

670
00:58:06,134 --> 00:58:07,975
Giant's the operative word here.

671
00:58:07,976 --> 00:58:10,743
We can sit and argue about
this or we can do something.

672
00:58:10,744 --> 00:58:13,475
In less than 24 hours
this country's gonna be overrun.

673
00:58:13,476 --> 00:58:15,119
- Give me the SAT phone.
- What?

674
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:16,695
- Calling the military.
- Good call.

675
00:58:16,696 --> 00:58:18,676
- You wanna do that?
- What else is there?

676
00:58:18,677 --> 00:58:22,259
- Hold on. Let's hear Hammett out.
- Our mission is based on secrecy.

677
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:25,009
Call the military,
we're kissing our paycheques goodbye.

678
00:58:25,010 --> 00:58:27,722
There are thousands-
No, millions of lives at stake here.

679
00:58:27,723 --> 00:58:29,400
- Make that call.
- Wanna go to jail?

680
00:58:29,401 --> 00:58:33,020
- I heard transgenics were illegal.
- Better 10-by-10 than 6 feet under.

681
00:58:33,021 --> 00:58:36,426
She's right. We're not equipped to
deal with this, no way to find them.

682
00:58:36,427 --> 00:58:39,799
I disagree. Our chances are excellent.
I know where the snakes are.

683
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:41,675
- How?
- I shot one with a tracker.

684
00:58:41,676 --> 00:58:43,917
One that can't be shed.

685
00:58:44,898 --> 00:58:46,807
Besides...

686
00:58:46,808 --> 00:58:48,996
wanna call in the military?

687
00:58:48,997 --> 00:58:51,612
They won't be here in time.

688
00:58:59,447 --> 00:59:02,212
You better be right.

689
00:59:23,122 --> 00:59:27,002
- Coffee?
- Sure. Thanks.

690
00:59:28,056 --> 00:59:30,289
Look...

691
00:59:30,290 --> 00:59:33,445
maybe we got off
on the wrong foot.

692
00:59:33,446 --> 00:59:37,196
Oh, I see. You've come here
to apologise, have you?

693
00:59:37,197 --> 00:59:41,475
No. Actually, I came here
to offer you a job.

694
00:59:43,675 --> 00:59:47,198
Well, then, I'd have to question
your intelligence.

695
00:59:47,199 --> 00:59:48,742
Why is that?

696
00:59:48,743 --> 00:59:53,445
Because you're the great white hunter
and I'm with the Ph. D., remember?

697
00:59:54,243 --> 00:59:57,945
Oh... Wow...

698
00:59:59,924 --> 01:00:04,202
I just hope that you're as good
as everybody says you are.

699
01:00:05,383 --> 01:00:09,069
No. I'm better.

700
01:00:30,626 --> 01:00:31,843
Got it.

701
01:00:31,844 --> 01:00:35,228
- The old industrial park.
- Okay, let's go.

702
01:00:45,506 --> 01:00:47,911
- You don't have to go.
- One of us needs to stay.

703
01:00:47,912 --> 01:00:49,420
- You good with that?
- Sure.

704
01:00:49,421 --> 01:00:52,508
Be our eyes. If anything changes,
let us know immediately.

705
01:00:52,509 --> 01:00:54,679
Got it.

706
01:02:05,321 --> 01:02:07,488
Straight ahead.

707
01:02:22,697 --> 01:02:24,933
- Pinkus?
- Yeah.

708
01:02:24,934 --> 01:02:28,079
Stay back and cover us, huh?

709
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:30,610
Okay.

710
01:02:53,764 --> 01:02:56,289
You're almost right on top of it.

711
01:03:04,608 --> 01:03:07,901
Okay... It's gotta be in here.

712
01:03:15,048 --> 01:03:16,918
Now.

713
01:03:16,919 --> 01:03:19,015
I go high.

714
01:03:19,016 --> 01:03:22,331
- Low left.
- Low right.

715
01:03:23,018 --> 01:03:28,040
One, two, three.

716
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:07,204
Oh, no.

717
01:04:08,542 --> 01:04:11,686
Sofia.

718
01:04:32,044 --> 01:04:34,504
Pinkus.

719
01:04:40,522 --> 01:04:43,373
Pinkus, hold on.

720
01:04:48,544 --> 01:04:51,818
They're coming this way.
I need backup.

721
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:55,930
Amanda's spotted the snakes.
We'll be right there.

722
01:04:55,931 --> 01:04:58,796
Leave him. There's nothing we can do.
Leave him.

723
01:05:02,992 --> 01:05:05,272
Sorry.

724
01:05:07,825 --> 01:05:10,838
I saw them go this way.

725
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:24,881
Let me guess. They swim.

726
01:05:25,992 --> 01:05:28,514
Unfortunately, very well.

727
01:05:28,515 --> 01:05:30,968
This is where they went in.

728
01:05:30,969 --> 01:05:34,110
- What's the temperature of that water?
- Forty, maybe 50 degrees.

729
01:05:34,111 --> 01:05:37,974
Well, they're cold-blooded, so they
can only last, like, 20 or 30 minutes.

730
01:05:37,975 --> 01:05:40,476
Thirty minutes.
Seven miles an hour.

731
01:05:40,477 --> 01:05:42,917
Puts them on that side of the lake.

732
01:05:42,918 --> 01:05:46,716
They would swim
until they found a food source.

733
01:05:46,843 --> 01:05:48,478
Which means...

734
01:05:48,879 --> 01:05:50,508
What?

735
01:05:50,809 --> 01:05:52,900
- She's about to give birth.
- What are you saying?

736
01:05:53,301 --> 01:05:56,175
The anaconda lays their young
next to an abundant food supply.

737
01:05:56,576 --> 01:05:58,474
The city.

738
01:05:58,509 --> 01:06:00,536
- What can we do?
- Find out where they went.

739
01:06:00,537 --> 01:06:03,454
- And we keep tracking.
- Keep tracking? Are you nuts?

740
01:06:03,955 --> 01:06:06,933
Half our crew is dead.
If we had called this in like Amanda...

741
01:06:06,934 --> 01:06:08,136
Nobody wanted this, man.

742
01:06:08,171 --> 01:06:10,099
Let me tell you a bit
about the military.

743
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:13,011
They're as reliable as a bottle of Jack
at an AA meeting.

744
01:06:13,012 --> 01:06:15,887
You are full of it. You've done nothing
but get us killed.

745
01:06:15,888 --> 01:06:18,374
Let me paint you a clearer picture.

746
01:06:18,375 --> 01:06:21,481
In about 12 hours, this entire country
is gonna be overrun...

747
01:06:21,482 --> 01:06:24,527
with baby snakes that will eat you
and everything in their paths.

748
01:06:24,528 --> 01:06:28,775
Now, we can either find them and stop
them or we can call in the military.

749
01:06:28,776 --> 01:06:32,345
- Call them.
- Andrei, give me the SAT phone.

750
01:06:34,663 --> 01:06:36,004
Yeah, it's Hammett.

751
01:06:36,005 --> 01:06:38,845
Put me through to Major Reysner.

752
01:06:38,846 --> 01:06:43,498
Major, a situation has arisen
that requires your urgent assistance.

753
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:45,289
A 100-foot mutated anaconda...

754
01:06:45,290 --> 01:06:48,168
has escaped a confined facility
near Baiton.

755
01:06:48,203 --> 01:06:50,819
We've been tracking it for two days.
We lost five men.

756
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:53,504
Now our concern
is for the local citizens.

757
01:06:53,505 --> 01:06:56,445
We need backup ASAP.

758
01:06:58,963 --> 01:07:00,830
Thank you. I'll alert my team.

759
01:07:00,831 --> 01:07:04,261
I'll keep the SAT phone on
and triangulate our position.

760
01:07:04,262 --> 01:07:06,210
Andrei, keep it on.

761
01:07:06,211 --> 01:07:08,582
Everyone happy?

762
01:07:09,134 --> 01:07:11,258
Now, you got two choices.

763
01:07:11,359 --> 01:07:15,906
You go home with a great
snake story or you go with me.

764
01:07:15,997 --> 01:07:17,939
I intend on getting a nice new pair...

765
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:21,828
of anaconda snakeskin boots
in the morning.

766
01:07:40,112 --> 01:07:41,845
Five more minutes, honey.

767
01:07:41,846 --> 01:07:45,175
Your father will be home soon.

768
01:07:59,965 --> 01:08:01,657
I got you.

769
01:08:01,658 --> 01:08:04,536
- What do you see?
- Unnatural patterns in the bushes.

770
01:08:04,537 --> 01:08:05,966
Patterns in the dirt.

771
01:08:05,967 --> 01:08:10,019
Every animal's got his stamp.
You just gotta know how to find them.

772
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:12,695
Call the others.

773
01:08:14,984 --> 01:08:18,347
Hammett's found the trail.
We're heading northwest.

774
01:08:18,648 --> 01:08:24,029
Our coordinates are 64982
by 450938. Over.

775
01:08:24,430 --> 01:08:26,737
We're heading west now.

776
01:08:26,938 --> 01:08:29,246
We should intersect Fairago Road...

777
01:08:30,247 --> 01:08:33,086
about 2.1 kilometres
from your location.

778
01:08:33,087 --> 01:08:35,890
Assuming that you stay
on that heading.

779
01:08:35,891 --> 01:08:38,254
Sounds right. Out.

780
01:08:38,255 --> 01:08:41,045
Okay. Turn here.

781
01:08:53,212 --> 01:08:55,852
What?

782
01:08:57,188 --> 01:08:59,730
We're less than a quarter mile
from our rendezvous?

783
01:08:59,931 --> 01:09:02,741
- Right.
- We have 20 minutes till they get here.

784
01:09:03,242 --> 01:09:04,481
What're you getting at?

785
01:09:04,482 --> 01:09:08,228
That factory is everything
a giant snake would want in a home.

786
01:09:08,229 --> 01:09:10,214
We have weapons and the time.
Let's go.

787
01:09:10,215 --> 01:09:12,729
Yeah, I'm with you.

788
01:09:19,444 --> 01:09:21,585
What is it?

789
01:09:21,586 --> 01:09:23,606
Trail just disappeared.

790
01:09:23,607 --> 01:09:25,788
- It can't just disappear.
- Yeah, I know.

791
01:09:25,789 --> 01:09:28,695
It's gotta be here somewhere.

792
01:09:29,015 --> 01:09:31,461
The trees.

793
01:09:32,178 --> 01:09:34,688
Look out!

794
01:09:40,998 --> 01:09:42,524
- You okay?
- Yeah.

795
01:09:42,825 --> 01:09:44,791
But I think God wants us to fail.

796
01:09:44,792 --> 01:09:46,780
Not just yet, pal. Not just yet.

797
01:09:46,781 --> 01:09:49,994
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

798
01:09:51,745 --> 01:09:54,375
Well, at least we've established
a rendezvous.

799
01:09:54,776 --> 01:09:56,976
Let's get the hell out of here.

800
01:09:57,377 --> 01:09:59,294
Take a look at this.

801
01:10:00,793 --> 01:10:03,910
Well, if there's blood,
there's more blood.

802
01:10:04,411 --> 01:10:06,648
Let's find it.

803
01:10:07,984 --> 01:10:10,327
Bingo.

804
01:10:10,879 --> 01:10:13,944
This snake just made our job
a hell of a lot easier.

805
01:10:13,945 --> 01:10:16,185
Let's go.

806
01:10:24,149 --> 01:10:25,709
- Did you see that?
- Yeah.

807
01:10:25,710 --> 01:10:28,824
We got a visual on the snake,
20 degrees west of your location.

808
01:10:28,859 --> 01:10:30,944
- Old abandoned power plant.
- Try him again.

809
01:10:30,945 --> 01:10:32,827
Andrei, do you copy?

810
01:10:32,828 --> 01:10:36,471
- I guess we're on our own.
- Give me the biggest gun you have.

811
01:10:36,472 --> 01:10:38,390
- How cute.
- Just kidding.

812
01:10:38,391 --> 01:10:42,258
- This big enough for you.
- It'll have to do for now.

813
01:11:17,502 --> 01:11:20,263
We're clear.

814
01:11:21,095 --> 01:11:23,004
You ready for this?

815
01:11:23,005 --> 01:11:25,506
Not even remotely.

816
01:11:25,607 --> 01:11:28,629
Attagirl.

817
01:11:43,826 --> 01:11:46,837
Nice apartment.

818
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:54,956
We saw it come in here, right?

819
01:11:54,957 --> 01:11:57,629
It would've been hard to miss.

820
01:13:16,048 --> 01:13:20,044
- This must be the guestroom.
- Yeah.

821
01:13:21,738 --> 01:13:23,912
I say we go over there.

822
01:13:23,913 --> 01:13:26,448
Okay.

823
01:13:45,039 --> 01:13:49,229
- The blood, here's the snake's blood.
- Yeah.

824
01:13:50,396 --> 01:13:53,871
That makes me feel a lot better.

825
01:14:00,684 --> 01:14:03,515
There's more right here.

826
01:15:03,653 --> 01:15:07,039
Hold on. Hold on.

827
01:15:17,592 --> 01:15:20,342
Clear.

828
01:15:30,842 --> 01:15:32,382
You got my back?

829
01:15:32,383 --> 01:15:35,060
I got your back.

830
01:16:06,237 --> 01:16:10,520
- They're playing hide and seek?
- Watch out!

831
01:16:11,524 --> 01:16:14,064
It's just rats.

832
01:16:21,356 --> 01:16:23,300
It's only rats.

833
01:16:23,301 --> 01:16:25,676
Just snake snacks.

834
01:16:42,870 --> 01:16:45,544
Hammett.

835
01:16:46,048 --> 01:16:50,062
That's it. All right, keep up.

836
01:17:04,643 --> 01:17:06,855
Where'd he go?

837
01:17:09,928 --> 01:17:12,613
No!

838
01:17:12,810 --> 01:17:14,317
Wait! Stop!

839
01:17:14,318 --> 01:17:16,890
No!

840
01:17:22,544 --> 01:17:25,956
Shoot me.

841
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:30,001
Damn it, Amanda! Take me out!

842
01:17:33,109 --> 01:17:35,324
What are you doing?

843
01:17:35,325 --> 01:17:37,393
Nick, no!

844
01:17:37,394 --> 01:17:40,310
What are you doing? No!

845
01:17:44,958 --> 01:17:48,373
No! Don't do it!

846
01:17:49,370 --> 01:17:51,482
What do I do?

847
01:17:51,483 --> 01:17:54,963
Run!

848
01:18:02,220 --> 01:18:04,831
Hurry!

849
01:18:46,176 --> 01:18:48,482
- Give me the SAT phone.
- We have to help them.

850
01:18:48,483 --> 01:18:51,631
You go on ahead.
I'm gonna check back.

851
01:18:51,632 --> 01:18:54,169
Four miles northeast of location.

852
01:18:54,170 --> 01:18:55,645
The old power plant.

853
01:18:55,646 --> 01:18:57,551
You can't miss it.

854
01:19:02,972 --> 01:19:04,271
Murdoch residence.

855
01:19:04,272 --> 01:19:06,988
It's Mr. Reysner.
Please, put me through to Murdoch.

856
01:19:06,989 --> 01:19:08,823
Just a second, sir.

857
01:19:08,824 --> 01:19:12,435
Mr. Murdoch,
Mr. Reysner on line for you.

858
01:19:12,436 --> 01:19:15,484
Tell him, I'll call him back
on the other line.

859
01:19:15,485 --> 01:19:18,091
Yes, sir.

860
01:19:23,711 --> 01:19:27,162
I told you not to call me
on any line but this one.

861
01:19:27,163 --> 01:19:29,093
Sorry. It won't happen again.

862
01:19:29,094 --> 01:19:32,204
I wanted to let you know
that everything is going as planned.

863
01:19:32,205 --> 01:19:33,550
We're right on schedule.

864
01:19:33,551 --> 01:19:35,185
Good.

865
01:19:35,186 --> 01:19:37,525
No one must know
anything about this.

866
01:19:37,526 --> 01:19:39,027
That won't be a problem.

867
01:19:39,028 --> 01:19:42,282
Just make sure our money's in place.

868
01:20:00,073 --> 01:20:01,414
Oh, God.

869
01:20:01,415 --> 01:20:03,601
Oh, my God,
I thought you guys were dead.

870
01:20:03,602 --> 01:20:05,727
- Our radio was broken.
- Where's Nick?

871
01:20:05,728 --> 01:20:08,437
- He's dead and so is the black one.
- The queen?

872
01:20:08,438 --> 01:20:11,115
- I think it's down that hall.
- What's this?

873
01:20:11,116 --> 01:20:12,281
- It's a slug.
- A what?

874
01:20:12,282 --> 01:20:14,354
- An infertile membrane, a dead egg.
- What?

875
01:20:14,355 --> 01:20:18,572
- She's about to start laying.
- Then let's finish this and get out!

876
01:20:25,062 --> 01:20:27,476
Sixty seconds
will give us enough time.

877
01:20:27,477 --> 01:20:30,652
We'll blow this whole place.

878
01:20:37,142 --> 01:20:38,848
What the hell? Hammett?

879
01:20:38,849 --> 01:20:40,587
Quite a sight, isn't it?

880
01:20:40,588 --> 01:20:42,257
The miracle of birth.

881
01:20:42,258 --> 01:20:46,409
I can't believe you wanna destroy
something so beautiful.

882
01:20:46,710 --> 01:20:49,688
Toss the gun down, soldier girl.

883
01:20:51,559 --> 01:20:53,200
What?

884
01:20:53,201 --> 01:20:55,738
You don't think I'd shoot you?

885
01:20:57,849 --> 01:20:59,052
Good girl.

886
01:20:59,054 --> 01:21:01,060
You have no idea
what you're doing.

887
01:21:01,061 --> 01:21:02,364
I think I do.

888
01:21:02,365 --> 01:21:06,413
Ten million dollars
for just one baby snake.

889
01:21:06,414 --> 01:21:08,386
You're working with Murdoch?

890
01:21:08,387 --> 01:21:11,696
You are not a doctor for nothing.

891
01:21:11,697 --> 01:21:13,806
There's no special forces unit,
is there?

892
01:21:13,807 --> 01:21:15,376
Two for two.

893
01:21:15,377 --> 01:21:17,622
Why don't you just shoot me?

894
01:21:17,623 --> 01:21:19,756
Well, you could be a meal.

895
01:21:19,793 --> 01:21:22,771
Or you could take a bullet
and be a meal.

896
01:21:22,772 --> 01:21:25,678
Or you could work
for a brand-new employer...

897
01:21:25,679 --> 01:21:30,797
who could use your expertise
in continuing the research.

898
01:21:35,886 --> 01:21:38,663
You cut me in on the 10 million?

899
01:21:40,702 --> 01:21:42,879
Negotiable.

900
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:46,190
Okay.

901
01:21:48,530 --> 01:21:49,949
Okay.

902
01:21:49,950 --> 01:21:51,815
Not!

903
01:22:01,006 --> 01:22:04,324
So you wanna play.

904
01:22:28,170 --> 01:22:32,558
I'm trying to be nice to you.

905
01:22:33,770 --> 01:22:35,958
Let me go.

906
01:23:18,923 --> 01:23:22,435
Happy trails, slimy bitch.

907
01:23:28,023 --> 01:23:31,804
Your 10 mil's about to go up
in flames, Hammett.

908
01:23:32,634 --> 01:23:35,446
I hope that's not the only thing.

909
01:23:37,956 --> 01:23:40,800
Good knowing you.

910
01:25:35,545 --> 01:25:39,720
Reysner,
you have a package for me?

911
01:25:39,757 --> 01:25:43,503
Yes, Mr. Murdoch, I have one.
I will begin research immediately.

912
01:25:43,504 --> 01:25:44,677
You show me proof...

913
01:25:44,678 --> 01:25:48,561
the money will be wired direct
to your account.
