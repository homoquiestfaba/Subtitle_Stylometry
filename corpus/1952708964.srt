1
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,680
I got nothing, sir.
No sign of Niobe or Ghost.

2
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,380
Nothing but blue pills.

3
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,330
-Should we try to contact them?
-Won't matter. My gut says they're down.

4
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,590
-We should start back.
-lf that ship can fly, we need it.

5
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,240
I was afraid you'd say that.

6
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,070
Search every pipe, every hole,
every crack we know.

7
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,670
Sweep as wide as possible,
as fast as possible.

8
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,570
-Lines are crawling with calamari.
-The sooner we find them the better.

9
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:52,610
-Thought you could use something to eat.
-Thank you.

10
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:55,320
Any change?

11
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,250
No.

12
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:03,060
-How is he?
-He's gonna be fine.

13
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,830
At least until he wakes up.

14
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,200
-What do you mean?
-Captain has some questions for him.

15
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,540
He'd better have some good answers.

16
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:15,870
You see these cuts?
I think they're self-inflicted.

17
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:20,110
-Why?
-VDTs maybe. I don't know.

18
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,620
But like I said,
the answer better be good.

19
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,960
Roland, I'd like to run another search
through the Matrix.

20
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:32,320
-For what?
-For Neo.

21
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,860
How could he be in the Matrix, sir?
He's not plugged in.

22
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,260
Please, for me.

23
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,470
This is what keeps bothering me.

24
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,640
What?

25
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,510
His neural patterns don't read
like someone who's in a coma.

26
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,660
The strange thing is,
I see these patterns all the time.

27
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:03,050
-Where?
-On someone jacked in.

28
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:18,100
The big bupkes. Nada.
He's not in there.

29
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,470
-Sir, I got the projections.
-How long?

30
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,170
Based on point of entry and the past speed,
the machines will be in Zion in 20 hours.

31
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:27,980
Jesus H. Christ.

32
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,780
All right, let's move with a purpose.
AK, I want you on holographics.

33
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:36,390
Mauser, I want forward and aft guns
manned at all times.

34
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,390
And make sure we are running
on as few pads as possible.

35
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,760
-Hey! You got a call.
-What?

36
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,300
Operator.

37
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,070
It's Seraph.

38
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:54,470
I bring word from the Oracle.
You must come at once.

39
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,920
Good morning.

40
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:13,690
-Who are you?
-My name is Sati. Your name is Neo.

41
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,890
My papa says you're not supposed
to be here. He says you must be lost.

42
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,100
Are you lost, Neo?

43
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:28,300
-Where am l?
-This is the train station.

44
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,410
-This isn't the Matrix?
-That's where the train goes.

45
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,920
That's where we're going,
but you cannot go with us.

46
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:42,060
-Why not?
-He won't let you.

47
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:46,760
-Who won't?
-The Trainman. I don't like him.

48
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:50,260
But my papa says we have to do
what the Trainman says...

49
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:54,340
...or else he will leave us here
forever and ever.

50
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:13,550
Morpheus, Trinity,
thank you for coming.

51
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:16,490
One thing I've learned in all my years...

52
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,750
...is that nothing ever works out
the way you want it to.

53
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,970
-Who are you?
-I'm the Oracle.

54
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:30,000
I wish there was an easy way to get
through this, but there ain't.

55
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:33,040
I'm sorry this had to happen.

56
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:36,810
I'm sorry I couldn't be sitting here
like you remember me...

57
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,920
-...but it wasn't meant to be.
-What happened?

58
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,980
I made a choice, and that choice
cost me more than I wanted it to.

59
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,580
What choice?

60
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,890
To help you, to guide Neo.

61
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:55,000
Now, since the real test for any choice
is having to make the same choice again...

62
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:59,000
...knowing full well
what it might cost...

63
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:03,230
...I guess I feel pretty good
about that choice...

64
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:06,140
...because here I am, at it again.

65
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:10,180
-Do you know what happened to Neo?
-Yes.

66
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:15,080
He is trapped in a place between
this world and the machine world.

67
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:19,550
The link is controlled by a program
called the Trainman.

68
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:24,320
He uses it to smuggle programs
in and out of the Matrix.

69
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:27,660
If he finds out where Neo is
before you get to him...

70
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:31,270
...then I'm afraid our choices
are going to become difficult.

71
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,600
-Why?
-Because of who the Trainman works for.

72
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,600
The Merovingian.

73
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:41,300
He has placed a bounty on your lives.
You must be careful at all times.

74
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:46,010
Seraph knows how to find the Trainman.
He'll go with you.

75
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,950
For years he has protected me.

76
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:52,620
I hope he can do the same for you.

77
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:56,520
Please, follow me.

78
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,060
Oracle....

79
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,430
I know, Morpheus.

80
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,370
I can see you're filled with doubt,
clouded by uncertainty.

81
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:14,170
After everything that has happened,
how can you expect me to believe you?

82
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,070
I don't.

83
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,910
I expect just what I've always expected:

84
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,380
For you to make up your own damn mind.
Believe me or don't.

85
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:29,030
All I can do is tell you that your friend
is in trouble, and he needs your help.

86
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:32,630
He needs all our help.

87
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,660
-Are you from the Matrix?
-Yes.

88
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,060
No.

89
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:41,260
-I mean, I was.
-Why did you leave?

90
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:45,440
-I had to.
-I had to leave my home too.

91
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:49,370
Sati! Come here, darling.
Leave the poor man in peace.

92
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,040
Yes, Papa.

93
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:59,550
I am sorry. She is still very curious.

94
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:03,460
-I know you.
-Yes, in the restaurant of the Frenchman.

95
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:08,360
I am Rama-Kandra. This is my wife,
Kamala. My daughter, Sati.

96
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,530
We are most honored to meet you.

97
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:13,300
-You are programs.
-Oh, yes.

98
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:17,930
I am the power-plant systems manager
for recycling operations.

99
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:22,200
My wife is an interactive software
programmer. She is highly creative.

100
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:24,870
What are you doing here?
You do not belong here.

101
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:29,990
Kamala! Goodness, I apologize.
My wife can be very direct.

102
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,720
It's okay.

103
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:34,550
I don't have an answer.

104
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,290
-I don't even know where "here" is.
-This place is nowhere.

105
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:41,260
It is between your world and our world.

106
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:45,760
-Who's the Trainman?
-He works for the Frenchman.

107
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,140
Why did I know you would say that?

108
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:52,240
The Frenchman does not forget,
and he does not forgive.

109
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,300
-You know him?
-I know only what I need to know.

110
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,420
I know that if you want to take something
from our world into your world...

111
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:02,780
...that does not belong there,
you must go to the Frenchman.

112
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,580
Is that what you're doing here?

113
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:08,720
-Rama, please.
-I do not want to be cruel, Kamala.

114
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:12,090
He may never see another face
for the rest of his life.

115
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,700
I'm sorry.

116
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,130
-You don't have to answer that question.
-No, I don't mind.

117
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,100
The answer is simple.

118
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,040
I love my daughter very much.

119
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:31,740
I find her to be the most beautiful thing
I have ever seen.

120
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,650
But where we are from,
that is not enough.

121
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:37,480
Every program that is created
must have a purpose.

122
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:41,050
If it does not, it is deleted.

123
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:44,890
I went to the Frenchman
to save my daughter.

124
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,800
-You do not understand.
-I just have never--

125
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:52,370
Heard a program speak of love.

126
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:57,470
-lt is a human emotion.
-No, it is a word.

127
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:02,040
What matters is the connection
the word implies.

128
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:07,440
I see that you are in love.

129
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:12,110
Can you tell me what you would give
to hold on to that connection?

130
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,550
Anything.

131
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:19,160
Then perhaps the reason you are here is not
so different than the reason I am here.

132
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,770
That's him.

133
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:32,810
-Get away! Get away from me!
-We don't want trouble.

134
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,880
-Get the hell away from me!
-We need your help.

135
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:39,640
I can't help you!
No one can help you!

136
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:31,860
Oh, no!

137
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,470
Damn it!

138
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:53,150
-When is the train due?
-lt is already late.

139
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,550
It's not like the Trainman to be late.

140
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,650
-You think it has something to do with me?
-I cannot say.

141
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:02,630
Who knows such things?
Only the Oracle.

142
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,670
-You know the Oracle?
-Everyone knows the Oracle.

143
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,600
I consulted with her
before I met with the Frenchman.

144
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,300
She promised to watch Sati
after we said goodbye.

145
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:13,440
Goodbye?

146
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:16,270
-You're not staying with her?
-lt is not possible.

147
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:20,510
Our arrangement with the Frenchman
was for our daughter only.

148
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,150
-My wife and I must return to our world.
-Why?

149
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:27,390
-That is our karma.
-You believe in karma?

150
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,750
Karma is a word, like love.

151
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:32,720
A way of saying:

152
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,130
"What I am here to do."

153
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:38,930
I do not resent my karma.
I'm grateful for it.

154
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,630
Grateful for my wonderful wife,
for my beautiful daughter.

155
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:46,870
They are gifts, and so I do
what I must do to honor them.

156
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:53,210
-Papa, the train!
-Yes. Find your bag. Quickly.

157
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,920
Can I carry that for you?

158
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,090
All right.

159
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:06,760
Hurry it up, I'm late!

160
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:15,100
-Who are you?
-He is a friend.

161
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:18,670
I know you.

162
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,570
-So that's what they wanted.
-I need to get back.

163
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:26,110
I'll pay you whatever you want.

164
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,780
One way or another,
I'm getting on this train.

165
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,610
Oh, no, no, no.

166
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,720
You'll stay here until
the Merovingian says different.

167
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:35,380
If I know him...

168
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:39,050
...you're gonna be here
for a long, long time.

169
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:43,330
-I don't want to hurt you.
-You don't get it.

170
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,090
I built this place.

171
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:50,570
Down here, I make the rules.
Down here, I make the threats.

172
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:59,110
Down here, I'm God.

173
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:05,250
Get on the train
or you'll stay here with him.

174
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,010
We should return to the Oracle.
She will know what to do.

175
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:26,900
No. We know what has to be done.

176
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,020
Shit.

177
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,760
You gotta be kidding.

178
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,980
Holy shit, it's wingless.

179
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,290
I get it.

180
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,300
You must be ready to die.

181
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,160
I need to speak with him.

182
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:29,000
Only way you're getting through this door
is over my big, dead ass.

183
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:31,100
So be it.

184
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,800
There are no weapons allowed
in the club.

185
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:00,400
At the bottom of this elevator,
there is a coat-check girl...

186
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:03,700
...and if we are lucky,
one man for checking weapons.

187
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:06,040
And if we're unlucky?

188
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:08,040
There will be many men.

189
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:12,580
Can I take your--? Oh, my God.

190
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,820
What in the hell?

191
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,430
I don't believe this.

192
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:48,690
Hey!

193
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:56,030
The prodigal child returns.

194
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:02,210
Are you here for the bounty, Seraph?

195
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:07,190
Tell me, how many bullets
are there in those guns?

196
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,520
I don't know, but I don't think
you have enough.

197
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:13,530
-We only want to talk.
-Oh, yes.

198
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:19,070
I'm sure you do. You have fought
through Hel to do so. Yes?

199
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,430
I'll tell you what I will do.

200
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,560
Put down the guns, and I will promise you
a safe passage out of here.

201
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:28,340
-All three of us?
-Oh, yes, yes.

202
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:31,240
Of course.

203
00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:03,070
Who could have guessed we would see
each other so soon after our last meeting?

204
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:06,350
The Fates are too kind, eh?

205
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:10,010
And since you, my little Judas,
have brought them here...

206
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:15,050
...I can only surmise that the fortuneteller
has found herself another shell?

207
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:18,490
Disappointing, but not unexpected.

208
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:22,150
I do hope, however, she has the good
manners to learn her lesson...

209
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:25,630
...and to remember that there is
no action without consequence.

210
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:30,900
And if you take something from me,
you will pay the price.

211
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:33,870
You know why we are here?

212
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:37,640
Come now, what kind of question is this?
Of course I know.

213
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:39,910
It is my business to know.

214
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,310
Some might think this is a strange
coincidence, but I do not.

215
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:50,090
I am curious, though,
as to how it actually happened.

216
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,390
-Do you know?
-No.

217
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,290
No?

218
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,630
I did not think so.

219
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,730
But it is always best to ask, huh?

220
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,890
We want to make a deal.

221
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:07,870
Always straight to business,
huh, Morpheus?

222
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:12,380
Okay. I have something you want.

223
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:14,480
To make a deal...

224
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:20,210
...you must have something
I want, yes?

225
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:24,720
And it so happens
there is something I want.

226
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:29,260
Something I have wanted
ever since I first came here.

227
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:32,230
It is said they cannot be taken...

228
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,970
...they can only be given.

229
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,370
What?

230
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:41,470
The eyes of the Oracle.

231
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,810
I told you before, there is no escaping
the nature of the universe.

232
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,750
It is that nature
that has again brought you to me.

233
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:55,580
Where some see coincidence,
I see consequence.

234
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,060
Where others see chance...

235
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:01,690
...I see cost.

236
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:07,170
Bring me the eyes of the Oracle...

237
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:10,640
...and I will give you back your savior.

238
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:15,540
It seems a perfectly fair
and reasonable deal to me.

239
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:17,640
Yes? No?

240
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,810
I don't have time for this shit.

241
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,350
You wanna make a deal?
How about this?

242
00:22:56,550 --> 00:23:00,580
You give me Neo, or we all die,
right here, right now.

243
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,460
Interesting deal.

244
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:11,430
You are really ready to die
for this man?

245
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,200
-Believe it.
-She'll do it.

246
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:18,570
If she has to,
she'll kill every one of us.

247
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,230
She's in love.

248
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:26,480
It is remarkable how similar the pattern
of love is to the pattern of insanity.

249
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:28,240
Time's up.

250
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:29,980
What's it gonna be, Merv?

251
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:38,490
Okay. You got yourself in here...

252
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:41,260
...you can get yourself out.

253
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:30,240
Are you ready for us?

254
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:33,380
Almost, sir. They got
some pretty ancient hacks here.

255
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:35,680
-But you found Neo?
-Can't you see him?

256
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:38,820
No, sir. We read something,
but I couldn't tell what.

257
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:44,920
I can't leave yet.

258
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:50,230
I have to see her.

259
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:53,130
Now?

260
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,640
It's my last chance.

261
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:00,640
That's it. That's the secret.

262
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:02,900
-You've got to use your hands.
-Why?

263
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:06,010
Cookies need love like everything does.

264
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:09,320
Neo!

265
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:14,590
I was hoping to have these done
before you got here. Oh, well.

266
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:18,680
Sati, honey, I think it's time
for a tasting.

267
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:21,860
Take the bowl to Seraph
and find out if they're ready.

268
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:24,120
Okay.

269
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,290
-I'm glad you got out.
-Me too.

270
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:34,540
So do you recognize me?

271
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:37,910
-A part of you.
-Yeah, that's how it works.

272
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,910
Some bits you lose,
some bits you keep.

273
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,950
I don't yet recognize my face
in the mirror...

274
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,490
...but I still love candy.

275
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,330
No, thank you.

276
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,620
Remember how you were
when you first walked through my door?

277
00:25:55,800 --> 00:26:00,860
Jittery as a June bug.
And now, just look at you.

278
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,230
You sure did surprise me, Neo,
and you still do.

279
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:07,700
You gave me a few surprises too.

280
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,180
I hope I helped.

281
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:13,750
You helped me to get here,
but my question is, why?

282
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:15,710
Where is this going?

283
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,410
-Where does it end?
-I don't know.

284
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:22,160
-You don't know or you won't tell me?
-I told you before...

285
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:27,620
...no one can see beyond a choice
they don't understand, and I mean no one.

286
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:32,130
-What choice?
-lt doesn't matter. It's my choice.

287
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,830
I have mine to make,
same as you have yours.

288
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:38,070
Does that include what things
to tell me and what not to?

289
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,770
-Of course not.
-Why didn't you tell me about the Architect?

290
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:46,180
About Zion and the ones before me?
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

291
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,020
-Because it wasn't time for you to know.
-Who decided it wasn't time?

292
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:54,080
You know who.

293
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,390
Know Thyself

294
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:02,960
I did.

295
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,830
Then I think it's time for me to know
a few more things.

296
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,730
So do l.

297
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:12,840
Tell me how I separated my mind
from my body without jacking in.

298
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:15,700
Tell me how I stopped four sentinels
by thinking it.

299
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:20,010
Tell me just what the hell
is happening to me.

300
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:25,640
The power of the One
extends beyond this world.

301
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:29,380
It reaches from here all the way back
to where it came from.

302
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,820
-Where?
-The source.

303
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:36,660
That's what you felt when you touched
those sentinels, but you weren't ready for it.

304
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:42,800
You should be dead, but apparently
you weren't ready for that either.

305
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:49,580
The Architect said that if I didn't return to
the source, Zion would be destroyed tonight.

306
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:54,050
Please. You and I may not be able
to see beyond our own choices...

307
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:56,980
...but that man can't see
past any choice.

308
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:01,180
-Why not?
-He doesn't understand them. He can't.

309
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,050
To him, they are variables
in an equation.

310
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:08,250
One at a time, each variable
must be solved, then countered.

311
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:12,130
That's his purpose.
To balance the equation.

312
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,660
What's your purpose?

313
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,860
To unbalance it.

314
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,130
Why? What do you want?

315
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:23,230
I want the same thing you want, Neo.

316
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:26,280
And I'm willing to go
as far as you are to get it.

317
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:29,310
The end of the war.

318
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:31,390
Is it going to end?

319
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:34,210
One way or another.

320
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:38,220
Can Zion be saved?

321
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:43,460
I'm sorry, I don't have the answer
to that question, but....

322
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:49,170
If there is an answer, there's only
one place you're going to find it.

323
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:52,030
-Where?
-You know where.

324
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:57,100
And if you can't find the answer...

325
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:00,770
...then I'm afraid there may be
no tomorrow for any of us.

326
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:05,050
What does that mean?

327
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:12,720
Everything that has a beginning...

328
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,360
...has an end.

329
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:18,470
I see the end coming.

330
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:21,540
I see the darkness spreading.

331
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,140
I see death.

332
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,500
And you are all that stands in his way.

333
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,900
Smith.

334
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:34,210
Very soon, he is going to have the power
to destroy this world.

335
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:37,110
But I believe he won't stop there.
He can't.

336
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:40,350
He won't stop until
there's nothing left at all.

337
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:42,090
What is he?

338
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:44,190
He is you.

339
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,790
Your opposite, your negative.

340
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,560
The result of the equation
trying to balance itself out.

341
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:54,770
-And if I can't stop him?
-One way or another, Neo...

342
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:58,800
...this war is going to end.

343
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:03,880
Tonight, the future of both worlds
will be in your hands...

344
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:05,880
...or in his.

345
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,960
How are you feeling?
Are you all right?

346
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:34,440
I need time.

347
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:42,680
-That figures.
-Captain Roland.

348
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:45,220
-What's up, Maggie?
-Bane is. He's conscious.

349
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:47,480
Good. Maybe he's got some answers.

350
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:57,560
I love that smell.

351
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,590
I sure am going to miss it.

352
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:05,400
-Oracle.
-I know.

353
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:06,800
I know.

354
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:09,670
Sati, honey.

355
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:13,110
Take a few cookies and go with Seraph.

356
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,050
Can I come back?
I would like to come back.

357
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:19,650
-I would like that too.
-Then I'll see you tomorrow.

358
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:24,820
I hope so, hon, I hope so.

359
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,850
I'm scared, Seraph.

360
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:52,420
Come.

361
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:38,260
He's following us.

362
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:46,240
Well, well, it's been a long time.

363
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:50,770
I remember chasing you
was like chasing a ghost.

364
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:52,910
I have beaten you before.

365
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:58,880
Yes, true, but as you can see,
things are a little different now.

366
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:02,720
And you must be the last exile.

367
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:06,920
-The Oracle told me about you.
-Really?

368
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,000
What did she say about me?

369
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,090
That you were a bad man.

370
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:16,130
Oh, I'm not so bad,
once you get to know me.

371
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:49,360
The great and powerful Oracle,
we meet at last.

372
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,610
I suppose you've been
expecting me, right?

373
00:33:56,780 --> 00:34:02,480
The all-knowing Oracle is never surprised.
How can she be? She knows everything.

374
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:07,350
But if that's true, then why is she here
if she knew I was coming?

375
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,580
Why wouldn't she leave?

376
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,620
Maybe you knew I would do that,
maybe you didn't.

377
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:21,360
If you did, that means you baked those
cookies and set that plate there...

378
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,230
...deliberately, purposefully...

379
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:27,430
...which means that you're sitting there
also deliberately, purposefully.

380
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,340
What did you do with Sati?

381
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:35,610
"Cookies need love
like everything does."

382
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:39,140
You are a bastard.

383
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,320
You would know, Mom.

384
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:48,520
Do what you're here to do.

385
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:51,020
Yes, ma'am.

386
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:40,170
I really wish I could help, but I just....
I don't remember any of it.

387
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,820
What about the cuts on your arms?
Those cuts are more than one day old.

388
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,980
Yeah, definitely.

389
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:51,490
You're right about that, sir.

390
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:55,330
They look like they might be self-inflicted.

391
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:59,730
But why would I do something
like that to myself?

392
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:04,670
Unless, of course, I wasn't myself.

393
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:09,500
But if I'm not me, then who am l?

394
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:18,410
-Has this man been tested for VDTs?
-Yes, sir. It was negative.

395
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:22,320
But he is showing a lot
of unusual neural activity.

396
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:25,820
Some cross-synaptic firing,
as well as signs of recent trauma...

397
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:29,790
...with fresh fibrotic scarring
throughout the cortex.

398
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:34,800
I want the truth. I don't care
what it takes. Make him remember.

399
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,860
Sir, we found her.

400
00:36:58,030 --> 00:36:59,120
-The Logos?
-Yes, sir.

401
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:01,320
About time we had
some goddamn good news.

402
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:34,450
Are the thermals picking up
any signs of life?

403
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,130
No, sir. Nothing yet.

404
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:40,930
-What about the ship?
-Holographic says the hull's still intact.

405
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:44,160
-Drop down and keep a man in the turret.
-Yes, sir.

406
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:58,450
Get a full diagnostic on that ship
as fast as humanly possible.

407
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,500
Careful, sir.

408
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:22,170
The squids are sneaky bastards.
It could be a trap.

409
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:49,700
What was that?

410
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:54,870
You can put that shit away, boys.
All she needs is a jump.

411
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:59,570
-Niobe.
-Morpheus.

412
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,850
-Are you all right?
-Yes, I'm fine.

413
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:08,850
We didn't know what happened after....

414
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:13,820
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

415
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,020
I'm happy to see you too.

416
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,800
-Did you get Neo out?
-Yes.

417
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:21,130
-How did you know about that?
-The Oracle.

418
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,900
-You saw her?
-Just before the sentinels found us.

419
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:28,540
-What did she tell you?
-The same thing she always does.

420
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:32,580
Exactly what I needed to hear.

421
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:37,080
In 12 hours, the machines
will breach the dock walls.

422
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:41,820
Every simulation we've run, we've seen
that once the machines are inside the city...

423
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:44,580
...the odds of our survival
decrease dramatically.

424
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,750
Thus, our primary objective must be...

425
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:50,390
...to destroy or disable the diggers
inside the dock.

426
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:54,800
If we can do that, perhaps we can prevent
them from ever reaching the city.

427
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:58,100
If not, the only place we will be able
to mount a defense...

428
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:00,430
...will be at the entrance of the temple.

429
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:03,370
It is small and will force
them into a bottleneck...

430
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:06,610
...allowing us to concentrate
the remainder of our defense.

431
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:10,010
We understand that you've requested
additional volunteers.

432
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,580
That is correct.

433
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:16,120
Precisely what size force are you planning
to commit to the primary dock objective?

434
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:19,820
Right now, the entire APU Corps
and half the infantry.

435
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,020
-Half the infantry?
-lf it were up to me, councillor...

436
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,460
...I'd take every man, woman and child,
put a gun in their hand...

437
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,500
...and march them into that dock.

438
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:31,430
Perhaps it is best
that it is not up to you.

439
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:33,570
Time will tell, councillor.

440
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,540
Commander, just one more question.

441
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:38,980
Has there been word
from the Nebuchadnezzar?

442
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:42,610
None, and at this point there's no reason
to expect there will be.

443
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:44,790
Perhaps.

444
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:46,420
But we can hope.

445
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:49,990
I'm afraid hope is an indulgence
I don't have time for.

446
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,770
-Zee, what are you doing?
-Making shells.

447
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:07,600
They're evacuating our level.
We have to go.

448
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:10,070
-I'm not going with you.
-What?

449
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:13,780
They've called for volunteers
to hold the dock.

450
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:19,920
Kids, you stay here.

451
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:24,220
I know how you feel,
but you can't do this.

452
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:26,420
-I have to.
-Why?

453
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:28,760
Because I love him.

454
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,800
I love him the same as he loves me.

455
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:35,300
And if I were out there and he were here,
I know what he'd do.

456
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:39,770
But you're gonna get yourself killed.
It's crazy, Zee.

457
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:45,100
Maybe it is. But ask yourself,
if it were Dozer...

458
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:49,150
...and you knew the only chance you had
to see him was to hold the dock...

459
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:51,440
...what would you do?

460
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:58,520
Make shells.

461
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,110
What the shit is going on over here?

462
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:15,800
An accident, sir. I didn't see--

463
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:18,100
-I'm sorry.
-Who the hell are you?

464
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,540
A unit volunteer, sir.

465
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:24,950
What's a pod-born pencil-neck like you
doing volunteering for my Corps?

466
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:29,080
I want to do my part, sir.
We gotta hold the dock.

467
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:32,590
-How old are you, kid?
-Eighteen.

468
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,890
Should have said 16,
I might have believed that.

469
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,390
Okay, I'm 16.

470
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:41,230
Minimum age for the Corps is 18.
Sixteen's too young.

471
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:46,200
The machines don't care how old I am.
They'll kill me just the same.

472
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,710
Ain't that the goddamn truth.

473
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:52,540
Give me a chance, sir.
I won't let you down.

474
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:58,480
You do, and you'll find me and the machines
have got something in common.

475
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:13,960
Okay, charge the igniter.

476
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:22,040
She lives again.

477
00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:25,400
You want to reload
the operations software, Sparky?

478
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:28,980
Yeah. Could you clean the windshield
while you're at it?

479
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:36,420
Uplinks in place.
I'm bringing her back online.

480
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:39,390
Looking good, except....

481
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,260
Something's wrong
with the Matrix feed.

482
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:46,630
No, there's not. You're looking
at what we're looking at.

483
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,290
-What's going on in there?
-Whatever it is, it can't be good.

484
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:53,300
The machines have taken Junction 21.

485
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:57,340
The way I see it, if we drop down
from broadcast here...

486
00:43:57,510 --> 00:44:00,140
...intersect 153, we might surprise them.

487
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:04,810
We'll go first, hammer as deep as we can,
then blow our EMP.

488
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:08,980
Hopefully we can punch a hole
big enough for you to get through.

489
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:15,390
It ain't pretty, but the way I see it,
it's the only way back.

490
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,050
No, it's not.

491
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:20,290
There's another way. A support line.

492
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:24,230
It drops down right here,
1000 meters short of 21.

493
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:28,440
If we're lucky, we may be able to slip down
without them ever knowing.

494
00:44:28,610 --> 00:44:30,840
That's a mechanical line.
It's impossible.

495
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:33,110
-No one can pilot a mechanical.
-I can.

496
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,770
-Bullshit.
-I've done it.

497
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:38,850
-That was a long time ago, Niobe.
-I said I can do it.

498
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:43,650
So what? You'll be the only one that can.
There's no way we can follow you.

499
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:47,720
Hi.

500
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:53,960
I know time is always against us.
I'm sorry that I took so long.

501
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:57,900
-But I wanted to be sure.
-Sure of what?

502
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:00,200
-I know what I have to do.
-What?

503
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:03,570
There's no easy way to say this,
so I'll just say it.

504
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:06,410
-I have to take one of the ships.
-What?

505
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:08,280
To go where?

506
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,620
To the machine city.

507
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:17,380
I know it's difficult to understand.

508
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:20,150
No, it's not. You're out
of your goddamn mind.

509
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:21,790
I still have to go.

510
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:25,160
In 100 years, no ship has been
within 100 kilometers of it.

511
00:45:25,330 --> 00:45:28,030
-You'll never make it.
-I have to try.

512
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:31,190
-ls this what the Oracle has told you?
-No.

513
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:34,710
This is asinine. If you want
to kill yourself, do it...

514
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,970
...but do it without
wasting our ships.

515
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:40,080
-You have to believe me. I have to go.
-Bullshit!

516
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:43,450
I am the captain of this ship.
I say where it has to go!

517
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:47,490
And this ship will go to hell
long before I let you take it anywhere.

518
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:55,190
-He can take mine.
-You can't do that.

519
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,130
Don't try to tell me
what I can or cannot do...

520
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:01,530
...with my ship
after that little speech.

521
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:06,140
-But for chris sake, Niobe--
-I'll pilot this ship, he can take mine.

522
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:10,270
If we leave inside the hour,
we should reach Zion as the machines do.

523
00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:13,010
That's as good a plan as any.

524
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:16,910
It's a waste. A goddamn waste.

525
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:25,650
Two ships, two directions.

526
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:29,020
Sounds like providence,
doesn't it, Morpheus?

527
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:32,830
-You've never believed in the One.
-I still don't.

528
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,730
Then why are you doing this?

529
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:37,900
I believe in him.

530
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:41,770
Thank you.

531
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:49,670
-What's that for?
-To help you relax.

532
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:52,750
To make it easier for you to remember.

533
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:55,550
What if I don't want to remember?

534
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,650
Why would you want that?

535
00:46:58,830 --> 00:47:01,850
What if I blew that EMP?

536
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:04,830
What if I did destroy those ships...

537
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,800
...and I am responsible
for the deaths of all those men?

538
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:14,840
If I did that...

539
00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:18,780
...it wouldn't be very safe
for me here, would it?

540
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:32,920
Of course, it might not be
very safe for you either.

541
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:42,900
I'm ready.

542
00:47:44,010 --> 00:47:46,000
Trinity...

543
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:49,570
...there's something I have to say.

544
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:55,480
Something you need to understand.

545
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,590
I know I'm supposed to go.

546
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:01,950
But beyond that...

547
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,390
...I don't know. I....

548
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:09,500
I know. You don't think
you're coming back.

549
00:48:11,270 --> 00:48:16,290
I knew it the moment you said you had
to leave. I could see it in your face.

550
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:20,640
Just like you knew the moment you looked
at me that I was coming with you.

551
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,340
I'm scared, Trin.

552
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,650
So am l.

553
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:32,110
It took me 10 minutes
to buckle up one boot.

554
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:35,180
But I'll tell you something.

555
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:38,320
Six hours ago, I told the Merovingian...

556
00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:41,490
...I was ready to give anything
and everything for you.

557
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,590
Do you know what's changed
in the last six hours?

558
00:48:46,770 --> 00:48:48,290
No.

559
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,200
Nothing.

560
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,850
-Finished loading ammunition?
-Just about.

561
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:08,350
Let's move it. We are out of time.

562
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,820
You're not leaving them anything?

563
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:13,150
He said he didn't need it.

564
00:49:17,030 --> 00:49:20,490
I ain't saying goodbye.
I'm saying good luck.

565
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:22,730
Thank you.

566
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:30,480
I can only hope you know
what you're doing.

567
00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:32,080
Me too.

568
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:37,840
It was an honor, sir.

569
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:44,180
No, the honor is still mine.

570
00:49:58,070 --> 00:50:01,130
-We're ready, sir.
-About damn time.

571
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:05,940
We're already late, captain,
so let's hit it and hit it hard.

572
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,580
Bye, baby.

573
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:13,580
Take good care of them.

574
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:37,210
Ready?

575
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:47,010
Engine's still firing.

576
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:49,850
Must be a fuse. I'll check it out.

577
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:07,570
-I should've known he'd send his bitch first.
-Bane.

578
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:10,870
No one ever got away from me
as many times as you did.

579
00:51:11,050 --> 00:51:13,040
Every time, I thought it was the last.

580
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:17,050
Every time, I was sure we had you,
but you'd slip through our fingers.

581
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:21,780
I really can't express
just how aggravating that can be.

582
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:25,190
What are you talking about?

583
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:30,590
I think I might enjoy killing you
as much as killing him.

584
00:51:46,610 --> 00:51:49,710
Neo, it's Bane. He's psychotic!

585
00:51:50,550 --> 00:51:53,180
You're gonna pay for that.

586
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:57,220
-Twenty-seven kilometers to go.
-We got an emergency.

587
00:51:57,390 --> 00:51:59,920
-What is it, AK?
-It's Maggie, sir.

588
00:52:00,090 --> 00:52:02,220
She's dead, murdered.
I think it was Bane.

589
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,890
Goddamn it.

590
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:10,240
I knew it. I knew he was
out of his goddamn mind.

591
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,170
He fired that EMP.

592
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:16,000
Goddamn it, I should have
beaten it out of him.

593
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:19,110
We searched the whole ship, captain.
He ain't here.

594
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:23,110
-I know where he is.
-The Logos.

595
00:52:24,790 --> 00:52:26,510
-We gotta go back.
-Too late.

596
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:29,660
-What if they need our help?
-It's too dangerous.

597
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:31,720
-Why?
-Because if he's killed them...

598
00:52:31,890 --> 00:52:33,480
...he'll control another EMP.

599
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,830
At this point, they're on their own.
Just like us.

600
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,100
Mr. Anderson.

601
00:52:42,970 --> 00:52:46,910
I see you are as predictable in this world
as you are in the other.

602
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:48,930
-What?
-He's out of his mind.

603
00:52:49,110 --> 00:52:52,050
It might appear that way.
But Mr. Anderson and I know...

604
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:55,110
...that appearances can be deceiving.

605
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:59,150
Confused, Mr. Anderson?
It'll all become clear in a moment.

606
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:02,480
Thank you for bringing me the gun.
You can set it down there.

607
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:04,680
Don't do it.

608
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:09,120
-Shoot. Shoot now.
-Yes, shoot. Fry us. Burn us alive.

609
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:12,560
Do it. If you don't, he'll kill us both.

610
00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:17,730
Look at him. He knows
he should do it, but he won't.

611
00:53:17,910 --> 00:53:20,900
-He can't.
-Do it.

612
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:31,970
Back away from the gun
and turn around.

613
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:40,320
Let her go.

614
00:53:53,510 --> 00:53:56,530
Somehow familiar, isn't it?

615
00:53:56,710 --> 00:54:00,870
We've been here before,
you and l, remember?

616
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:04,610
I do. I think of nothing else.

617
00:54:09,190 --> 00:54:12,320
-Who are you?
-Still don't recognize me?

618
00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:17,990
I admit, it is difficult to even think
encased in this rotting piece of meat.

619
00:54:18,170 --> 00:54:24,500
The stink of it filling every breath,
a suffocating cloud you can't escape.

620
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,570
Disgusting.

621
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:34,480
Look at how pathetically fragile it is.
Nothing this weak is meant to survive.

622
00:54:39,850 --> 00:54:43,190
-What do you want?
-I want what you want.

623
00:54:46,290 --> 00:54:50,660
Yes. That's it, Mr. Anderson.

624
00:54:50,830 --> 00:54:52,800
Look past the flesh.

625
00:54:52,970 --> 00:54:58,300
Look through the soft gelatin of these
dull cow eyes and see your enemy.

626
00:55:00,410 --> 00:55:03,340
-No.
-Oh, yes, Mr. Anderson.

627
00:55:03,710 --> 00:55:06,610
-lt can't be.
-There's nowhere I can't go.

628
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:09,680
There is nowhere I won't find you.

629
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:13,880
-It's impossible.
-Not impossible.

630
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,010
Inevitable.

631
00:55:17,890 --> 00:55:19,860
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.

632
00:55:20,030 --> 00:55:21,720
This is it. It's gotta be.

633
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:08,400
Oh, no.

634
00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:30,500
I wish you could see yourself,
Mr. Anderson.

635
00:56:34,970 --> 00:56:37,200
Blind messiah.

636
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:44,770
You're a symbol for all of your kind,
Mr. Anderson.

637
00:56:47,650 --> 00:56:49,780
Helpless.

638
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:54,350
Pathetic.

639
00:56:57,260 --> 00:57:01,520
Just waiting to be put out
of your misery.

640
00:57:06,830 --> 00:57:08,270
I can see you.

641
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:19,940
It's not over, Mr. Anderson.

642
00:57:20,110 --> 00:57:22,010
It's not over.

643
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:38,930
-Trinity!
-Neo.

644
00:57:40,470 --> 00:57:41,930
Neo.

645
00:57:44,910 --> 00:57:48,070
Oh, no. Your eyes.

646
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:50,400
I'll be okay.

647
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:53,940
It's all right, Trin.

648
00:57:55,650 --> 00:57:58,580
But I think you're gonna have to drive.

649
00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:08,250
Seismic's projecting 22 minutes to breach.

650
00:58:08,430 --> 00:58:12,090
They can't know we don't have an EMP.
They'll have to attack in waves.

651
00:58:12,270 --> 00:58:16,930
Concentrate our offense on the diggers.
Order the APUs into position.

652
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:18,590
Yes, sir.

653
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:51,200
Come on, move.

654
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:24,960
All right!

655
00:59:25,170 --> 00:59:26,970
This is it.

656
00:59:27,170 --> 00:59:32,200
Now, you all know me,
so I'll just say this as simple as I can.

657
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:36,850
If it's our time to die, it's our time.

658
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:42,480
All I ask is, if we have
to give these bastards our lives...

659
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:45,520
...we give them hell before we do!

660
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:47,690
Yeah!

661
01:00:02,510 --> 01:00:05,410
-You scared, Charra?
-Shit, yeah.

662
01:00:06,410 --> 01:00:07,940
But I'll make you a deal.

663
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:11,680
You keep loading, I keep shooting.

664
01:00:13,890 --> 01:00:15,790
Deal.

665
01:00:25,270 --> 01:00:28,260
-Holy Christ, would you look at that.
-Quiet.

666
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:31,640
-How far to the opening?
-1.4 kilometers.

667
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:36,500
-We're still generating too hot a field.
-Ghost, kill all auxiliary systems.

668
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:40,480
-Give me full manual. Drop down four pads.
-lt'll bottom out.

669
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:53,820
-Easy, baby.
-Seven hundred meters.

670
01:00:56,330 --> 01:00:59,030
If we can just get close enough....

671
01:01:03,470 --> 01:01:04,840
Six hundred meters.

672
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:07,600
There.

673
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:16,770
Shit!

674
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:21,550
-Jig's up, here they come.
-Give me full power.

675
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:24,520
Man the gun turrets,
every goddamn one of them. Go!

676
01:01:24,690 --> 01:01:28,350
Ghost, you're the best gunner,
go with them. Morpheus, take his place.

677
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:48,210
I'm coming, baby.

678
01:01:57,060 --> 01:01:59,030
Here they come.

679
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:07,390
-Slow down, this ain't the Logos.
-Hang on to your lunch, Roland, here we go.

680
01:02:16,110 --> 01:02:19,200
Holy Christ, I didn't know
this ship could do that.

681
01:03:11,060 --> 01:03:12,620
Breach! The dock is breached!

682
01:03:33,620 --> 01:03:35,640
Knuckle up!

683
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:50,560
For Zion!

684
01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:00,420
Shit.

685
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,330
Come on, let's go.

686
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:14,510
Knuckle up!

687
01:06:29,590 --> 01:06:30,990
Reload!

688
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:34,630
Reload nine!

689
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:42,600
Go, go! Move, move!

690
01:06:54,990 --> 01:06:56,680
Watch your left!

691
01:06:57,750 --> 01:06:59,980
Don't let them through!

692
01:07:02,930 --> 01:07:04,480
Zuka!

693
01:07:41,460 --> 01:07:43,260
Oh, my God.

694
01:07:56,950 --> 01:08:00,540
Where the hell's my infantry?
I want that goddamn machine taken down!

695
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:35,710
Dig this!

696
01:08:39,990 --> 01:08:41,220
Oh, shit!

697
01:09:01,980 --> 01:09:04,240
-Bogey two at the breach point!
-Goddamn it!

698
01:09:30,310 --> 01:09:32,430
Shit, she's got a fat ass.

699
01:09:41,750 --> 01:09:45,210
-Keep them off me!
-Christ, there's a shitstorm of them.

700
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:19,780
-You see that?
-They're after the radio. Stop them!

701
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:28,890
Damn it!

702
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:55,220
Yeah.

703
01:11:06,940 --> 01:11:08,770
Grab my belt.

704
01:11:19,220 --> 01:11:20,680
Just give me one clean shot.

705
01:11:27,590 --> 01:11:28,650
Damn it!

706
01:11:51,410 --> 01:11:53,040
Charra!

707
01:11:58,020 --> 01:12:00,720
-I got incoming!
-We got a dock full of incoming!

708
01:12:00,890 --> 01:12:03,290
-Yes, sir. But this is different, sir.
-What?

709
01:12:03,930 --> 01:12:05,660
I think it's one of ours, sir.

710
01:12:05,830 --> 01:12:08,800
-That's impossible.
-Holographics are trying to confirm.

711
01:12:08,970 --> 01:12:10,690
Contact them.
I want access codes.

712
01:12:10,870 --> 01:12:13,390
We're trying, sir.
There's no response.

713
01:12:14,770 --> 01:12:17,470
It's a trick. That's not one of ours,
it can't be.

714
01:12:17,670 --> 01:12:21,470
That's a mechanical line.
No one can pilot mechanical.

715
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:34,990
-Forward aft, 30 degrees at 80 percent.
-Thirty degrees, 80.

716
01:12:38,030 --> 01:12:41,050
-Lower starboard 60 degrees, 20 percent.
-Sixty degrees.

717
01:12:43,780 --> 01:12:46,770
-Shit! Come on, keep up!

718
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:09,490
Sir, holographic confirms.
It's the Hammer, sir.

719
01:13:10,030 --> 01:13:11,360
How can that be?

720
01:13:11,530 --> 01:13:13,530
It's under attack, sustaining damage.

721
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:16,500
At its present velocity,
it'll reach Gate Three in 12 minutes.

722
01:13:16,670 --> 01:13:19,010
Their EMP could take out every sentinel.

723
01:13:19,910 --> 01:13:23,350
It'd take out more than that.
It'll wipe out our defense system.

724
01:13:23,510 --> 01:13:25,740
We blow an EMP inside,
we lose the dock.

725
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:28,220
Sir, we already lost the dock.

726
01:13:32,490 --> 01:13:33,720
Open the gate.

727
01:13:35,530 --> 01:13:39,760
Gate Three is not responding!
We've taken critical damage, sir!

728
01:13:39,930 --> 01:13:42,160
We've lost control!
We can't open it!

729
01:13:52,310 --> 01:13:53,280
There's the exit.

730
01:13:53,480 --> 01:13:56,910
On my mark, give me full power
90 degrees to lower-left starboard.

731
01:13:57,380 --> 01:13:59,180
Full power...

732
01:13:59,550 --> 01:14:00,780
...ninety degrees.

733
01:14:06,990 --> 01:14:08,360
Now!

734
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:17,860
Hold on, baby.

735
01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:24,340
Goddamn, woman, you can drive.

736
01:14:24,510 --> 01:14:26,500
We ain't home yet.
What about the gate?

737
01:14:29,180 --> 01:14:30,650
Sentinels are inside the dock.

738
01:14:32,180 --> 01:14:33,410
Are we too late?

739
01:15:02,620 --> 01:15:05,350
-How many APUs are operational?
-Thirteen, sir.

740
01:15:05,530 --> 01:15:07,490
Get me the one closest to Gate Three.

741
01:15:36,090 --> 01:15:37,280
Reload!

742
01:15:37,490 --> 01:15:38,680
He's pissing metal.

743
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:43,720
Go!

744
01:15:58,240 --> 01:15:59,580
Go!

745
01:16:21,430 --> 01:16:23,230
Heads up! They're coming around!

746
01:16:36,180 --> 01:16:37,770
Behind you!

747
01:16:51,330 --> 01:16:53,200
It's jammed!

748
01:16:58,910 --> 01:17:01,600
Forget it, kid! Get out of here!

749
01:17:03,060 --> 01:17:04,720
Got it!

750
01:17:33,290 --> 01:17:35,120
Captain Mifune.

751
01:17:38,230 --> 01:17:40,160
Oh, no.

752
01:17:40,730 --> 01:17:41,990
They're coming.

753
01:17:44,270 --> 01:17:45,960
They're coming.

754
01:17:47,340 --> 01:17:48,530
The Hammer.

755
01:17:49,110 --> 01:17:50,500
What?

756
01:17:50,910 --> 01:17:53,710
You have to open that gate.

757
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:56,140
Cut the counterweights.

758
01:17:58,310 --> 01:17:59,650
You can do it.

759
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:03,140
Hurry. There's no time.

760
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:05,950
Captain...

761
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:08,490
...I didn't finish the training program.

762
01:18:11,860 --> 01:18:13,490
Neither did l.

763
01:18:35,820 --> 01:18:38,010
-Lock that down!
-Kill the feeder!

764
01:18:38,420 --> 01:18:41,550
We won't make it.
We gotta blow the EMP now.

765
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:44,820
Come on, someone, please.

766
01:18:59,610 --> 01:19:01,370
Keep the weight forward.

767
01:19:03,410 --> 01:19:05,180
Light as a feather.

768
01:19:09,550 --> 01:19:13,550
Holographic reports Captain Mifune's APU
is up and moving to Gate Three.

769
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:21,620
Don't over-squeeze the trigger.

770
01:19:32,380 --> 01:19:34,340
Mifune's APU just reached Gate Three.

771
01:19:34,540 --> 01:19:37,340
-How much time?
-Two minutes to impact.

772
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:41,850
-Captain Mifune, do you copy?
-I think his radio is down, sir.

773
01:19:42,020 --> 01:19:43,490
Mifune...

774
01:19:43,650 --> 01:19:45,280
...this is Lock.

775
01:19:45,490 --> 01:19:48,360
I don't know if you can hear me,
but if you can...

776
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:50,860
...the Hammer's two minutes away.

777
01:19:51,430 --> 01:19:55,630
You've got two minutes, captain,
to get that gate open.

778
01:19:57,230 --> 01:19:58,220
Link.

779
01:19:59,170 --> 01:20:01,430
Get to the main deck!
Charge the EMP!

780
01:20:38,110 --> 01:20:39,730
Do it, kid.

781
01:20:43,780 --> 01:20:46,710
Neo. I believe.

782
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:57,780
-Yes!
-Can we make it?

783
01:20:59,100 --> 01:21:01,150
We ain't come this far.

784
01:21:13,340 --> 01:21:15,610
Almost home, almost home.

785
01:21:35,030 --> 01:21:36,220
Burn it, Link!

786
01:22:00,820 --> 01:22:03,690
-You did it.
-No.

787
01:22:04,060 --> 01:22:05,080
We did it.

788
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:08,090
You're a hell of a pilot.

789
01:22:10,770 --> 01:22:14,070
Some things in this world never change.

790
01:22:14,370 --> 01:22:15,800
But some things do?

791
01:22:17,340 --> 01:22:19,000
Luckily...

792
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:21,140
...some things do.

793
01:22:32,890 --> 01:22:34,120
Link!

794
01:22:34,820 --> 01:22:36,450
-Zee? Zee!
-Link!

795
01:22:43,430 --> 01:22:46,270
I knew you'd come. I knew it.

796
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,970
I made a promise.

797
01:22:57,780 --> 01:22:59,180
You did wear it.

798
01:23:01,020 --> 01:23:04,420
Are you kidding?
I'm never gonna take it off.

799
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:16,160
Three captains, one ship.

800
01:23:16,330 --> 01:23:20,330
I'll assume the other ships were lost
under equally pointless circumstances.

801
01:23:20,540 --> 01:23:22,130
Good to see you too, Jason.

802
01:23:22,340 --> 01:23:24,670
The Council's waiting to hear
an explanation.

803
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:28,970
Forgive me for not attending,
but I have to try to salvage this debacle.

804
01:23:29,710 --> 01:23:32,310
Did I miss something?
I thought we saved the dock.

805
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:34,350
That's the problem with you people.

806
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:37,080
You can't think but five minutes
in front of you.

807
01:23:37,390 --> 01:23:40,950
That EMP knocked out almost every piece
of hardware and every APU.

808
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:44,090
If I were the machines,
I'd send every sentinel here now.

809
01:23:44,390 --> 01:23:48,020
Save the dock, captain?
You handed it to them on a silver platter.

810
01:23:53,770 --> 01:23:55,760
Come on, get it cut.

811
01:23:57,470 --> 01:23:58,670
The bridge is clear.

812
01:24:01,210 --> 01:24:03,180
Do you hear that?

813
01:24:05,510 --> 01:24:07,040
Get that cable run!

814
01:24:07,220 --> 01:24:11,050
-I want the system back online!
-It's the dock. They've got incoming.

815
01:24:12,350 --> 01:24:14,720
Order everyone to fall back.

816
01:24:14,890 --> 01:24:17,590
Seal the shaft. Now.

817
01:24:18,330 --> 01:24:20,020
Move it!

818
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:24,990
Oh, my God.

819
01:24:33,210 --> 01:24:35,370
-All clear.
-Do it.

820
01:24:35,540 --> 01:24:37,740
-Go! Come on! Run!
-Go!

821
01:24:54,030 --> 01:24:55,620
Your move.

822
01:24:56,730 --> 01:24:58,460
So you gave them your ship?

823
01:24:58,930 --> 01:25:03,000
-That is correct, councillor, I did.
-Knowing what he planned to do with it?

824
01:25:04,710 --> 01:25:06,540
The Oracle said nothing of this?

825
01:25:07,580 --> 01:25:12,070
She told me Neo would need my help,
and I would choose to help him or not.

826
01:25:12,450 --> 01:25:16,910
But what hope can a single vessel have
against their entire defense system?

827
01:25:17,090 --> 01:25:20,280
None. It's completely impossible.
But he wouldn't listen.

828
01:25:20,460 --> 01:25:24,760
He wouldn't even take any ammunition.
He was totally out of his goddamn mind.

829
01:25:24,930 --> 01:25:27,730
No, he wasn't.

830
01:25:29,570 --> 01:25:32,260
Neo is doing what he believes
he must do.

831
01:25:33,670 --> 01:25:36,870
I don't know if what he's doing is right.
I don't know...

832
01:25:37,070 --> 01:25:39,670
...if he'll reach the machine city.

833
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:43,110
And if he does, I don't know
what he can do to save us.

834
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:49,180
But I do know that as long as there is
a single breath in his body...

835
01:25:50,650 --> 01:25:52,680
...he will not give up.

836
01:25:53,960 --> 01:25:55,480
And neither can we.

837
01:26:01,860 --> 01:26:03,260
Temperature's dropping.

838
01:26:06,900 --> 01:26:08,100
Here we go.

839
01:26:47,710 --> 01:26:49,440
We're over the fields, aren't we?

840
01:26:50,850 --> 01:26:52,180
How do you know that?

841
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:54,820
I can feel them.

842
01:27:03,530 --> 01:27:05,120
Over there.

843
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:09,860
There's our path. Can you see it?
Three lines.

844
01:27:10,030 --> 01:27:11,290
Power lines.

845
01:27:12,300 --> 01:27:14,060
Follow them.

846
01:27:31,050 --> 01:27:32,920
What are they doing?

847
01:27:33,090 --> 01:27:34,780
I don't know.

848
01:27:35,690 --> 01:27:36,680
Lieutenant?

849
01:27:52,740 --> 01:27:54,070
Goddamn it.

850
01:27:54,510 --> 01:27:55,740
What do we do now?

851
01:28:00,450 --> 01:28:02,470
It is now a matter of time.

852
01:28:03,250 --> 01:28:05,740
The machines will breach
the walls of this city.

853
01:28:07,090 --> 01:28:11,550
I recommend that the Council join the other
non-military personnel inside the temple.

854
01:28:12,230 --> 01:28:13,590
How long do we have?

855
01:28:14,030 --> 01:28:16,760
Two hours. Maybe less.

856
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:22,700
My men have fortified the entrance
with enough artillery to make our last stand.

857
01:28:24,640 --> 01:28:27,110
Beyond that, there isn't anything more
I can do.

858
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:31,080
Commander, do you think that
we have any chance of surviving?

859
01:28:32,810 --> 01:28:35,250
If I were you, I wouldn't
ask me that question.

860
01:28:36,420 --> 01:28:37,780
I would ask him.

861
01:28:38,650 --> 01:28:42,320
-Why?
-He's the one who believes in miracles.

862
01:28:49,570 --> 01:28:52,130
There. Those mountains.

863
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,030
That's it.

864
01:28:58,240 --> 01:29:00,170
-Do you see what's out there?
-Yes.

865
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:03,270
If you tell me we'll make it,
I'll believe you.

866
01:29:03,450 --> 01:29:05,110
We'll make it.

867
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:09,810
We have to.

868
01:30:23,160 --> 01:30:24,850
Sentinels.

869
01:30:36,340 --> 01:30:37,600
There's too many!

870
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:55,590
Gotcha!

871
01:30:56,360 --> 01:30:58,520
-I need help here!
-I can't beat them.

872
01:30:58,690 --> 01:31:01,060
-What do we do?
-Go up, over them.

873
01:31:01,330 --> 01:31:04,320
-What?
-The sky! It's the only way.

874
01:31:06,300 --> 01:31:08,030
Then up we go.

875
01:31:43,340 --> 01:31:45,200
Beautiful.

876
01:32:07,030 --> 01:32:09,660
Pump the igniter. The ship will start.

877
01:32:17,110 --> 01:32:19,570
Again. Slowly.

878
01:32:22,510 --> 01:32:24,000
Now!

879
01:32:49,570 --> 01:32:51,060
Trin?

880
01:32:53,140 --> 01:32:54,940
Trinity?

881
01:32:56,010 --> 01:32:57,670
Trinity?

882
01:32:58,810 --> 01:33:00,940
-I'm here.
-Where?

883
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:02,340
Here.

884
01:33:12,830 --> 01:33:14,060
We made it.

885
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:17,630
You said we would.

886
01:33:19,940 --> 01:33:22,400
It's unbelievable, Trin.

887
01:33:23,410 --> 01:33:25,070
Light everywhere.

888
01:33:25,410 --> 01:33:28,270
Like the whole thing was built of light.

889
01:33:28,940 --> 01:33:31,110
I wish you could see what I see.

890
01:33:32,780 --> 01:33:34,750
You've already shown me so much.

891
01:33:37,020 --> 01:33:40,320
What is it, Trinity?
What's wrong?

892
01:33:41,720 --> 01:33:44,210
I can't go with you, Neo.

893
01:33:45,890 --> 01:33:47,690
I've gone as far as I can.

894
01:33:48,100 --> 01:33:49,320
What?

895
01:33:52,300 --> 01:33:53,770
Oh, no.

896
01:33:54,670 --> 01:33:56,360
Oh, no. No, no.

897
01:33:57,140 --> 01:33:58,770
It's all right.

898
01:34:00,210 --> 01:34:01,700
It's time.

899
01:34:03,350 --> 01:34:05,810
I've done all that I could do.

900
01:34:07,050 --> 01:34:09,410
Now you have to do the rest.

901
01:34:10,190 --> 01:34:12,280
You have to finish it.

902
01:34:12,620 --> 01:34:14,780
You have to save Zion.

903
01:34:15,260 --> 01:34:16,950
I can't.

904
01:34:17,390 --> 01:34:20,730
-Not without you.
-Yes, you can.

905
01:34:21,260 --> 01:34:22,960
You will.

906
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:27,130
I believe it. I always have.

907
01:34:29,640 --> 01:34:31,230
Trinity.

908
01:34:33,540 --> 01:34:36,980
Trinity, you can't die.

909
01:34:39,050 --> 01:34:41,110
You can't.

910
01:34:41,420 --> 01:34:43,010
You can't.

911
01:34:43,180 --> 01:34:45,310
Yes, I can.

912
01:34:48,490 --> 01:34:50,920
You brought me back once.

913
01:34:53,130 --> 01:34:55,220
But not this time.

914
01:35:01,070 --> 01:35:02,970
Do you remember...

915
01:35:04,770 --> 01:35:07,710
...on that roof, after you caught me...

916
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:11,070
...the last thing I said to you?

917
01:35:13,850 --> 01:35:15,340
You said, "I'm sorry."

918
01:35:16,690 --> 01:35:18,780
I wish I hadn't.

919
01:35:21,860 --> 01:35:24,120
That was my last thought.

920
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:29,360
I wished I had one more chance...

921
01:35:30,270 --> 01:35:32,500
...to say what really mattered.

922
01:35:35,140 --> 01:35:37,900
To say how much I loved you.

923
01:35:40,340 --> 01:35:43,740
How grateful I was for every moment
I was with you.

924
01:35:46,550 --> 01:35:51,490
But by the time I knew how to say
what I wanted to, it was too late.

925
01:35:57,530 --> 01:36:00,050
But you brought me back.

926
01:36:02,900 --> 01:36:05,160
You gave me my wish.

927
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:12,530
One more chance to say
what I really wanted to say.

928
01:36:17,250 --> 01:36:19,110
Kiss me.

929
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:23,850
Once more...

930
01:36:25,590 --> 01:36:26,950
...kiss me.

931
01:36:54,380 --> 01:36:58,480
Get that ammunition where it belongs!
You got one chance to get this right.

932
01:36:59,120 --> 01:37:00,880
Get that damn thing mounted!

933
01:37:05,890 --> 01:37:08,450
-Hurry.
-Let's go, let's go, let's go!

934
01:37:23,380 --> 01:37:24,740
Neo...

935
01:37:25,050 --> 01:37:27,450
...if you're gonna do something,
do it quick.

936
01:39:36,280 --> 01:39:38,340
I only ask to say
what I've come to say.

937
01:39:38,510 --> 01:39:42,350
After that, do what you want,
and I won't try and stop you.

938
01:39:46,590 --> 01:39:47,820
Speak.

939
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:51,530
The program Smith has grown
beyond your control.

940
01:39:51,690 --> 01:39:55,090
He will spread through this city
as he spread through the Matrix.

941
01:39:55,260 --> 01:39:56,590
You cannot stop him.

942
01:39:58,700 --> 01:40:01,030
-But I can.
-We don't need you!

943
01:40:02,070 --> 01:40:04,370
We need nothing!

944
01:40:05,470 --> 01:40:09,410
If that's true, then I've made a mistake,
and you should kill me now.

945
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:16,380
What do you want?

946
01:40:17,820 --> 01:40:19,050
Peace.

947
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:46,810
What are they doing?

948
01:40:52,390 --> 01:40:54,380
What are you doing?

949
01:40:57,560 --> 01:40:59,490
Morpheus!

950
01:41:23,820 --> 01:41:25,810
And if you fail?

951
01:41:28,060 --> 01:41:30,050
I won't.

952
01:41:51,550 --> 01:41:53,100
Neo.

953
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:54,980
He fights for us.

954
01:42:36,660 --> 01:42:39,560
Mr. Anderson, welcome back.

955
01:42:39,730 --> 01:42:41,850
We missed you.

956
01:42:45,970 --> 01:42:48,900
You like what I've done with the place?

957
01:42:49,500 --> 01:42:51,200
It ends tonight.

958
01:42:52,170 --> 01:42:55,140
I know it does. I've seen it.

959
01:42:55,340 --> 01:42:59,110
That's why the rest of me
is just going to enjoy the show...

960
01:42:59,280 --> 01:43:02,840
...because we already know
that I'm the one that beats you.

961
01:44:55,200 --> 01:44:58,100
Can you feel it, Mr. Anderson...

962
01:44:58,270 --> 01:45:00,700
...closing in on you?

963
01:45:00,870 --> 01:45:02,960
Oh, I can.

964
01:45:04,340 --> 01:45:08,430
I really should thank you for it.
After all, it was your life...

965
01:45:08,640 --> 01:45:12,240
...that taught me the purpose of all life.

966
01:45:12,680 --> 01:45:16,170
The purpose of life is to end.

967
01:48:52,070 --> 01:48:53,970
Why, Mr. Anderson?

968
01:48:54,140 --> 01:48:58,090
Why, why, why?

969
01:48:58,270 --> 01:48:59,470
Why do you do it?

970
01:49:00,270 --> 01:49:02,170
Why? Why get up?

971
01:49:02,380 --> 01:49:04,170
Why keep fighting?

972
01:49:05,710 --> 01:49:08,200
Do you believe you're fighting
for something?

973
01:49:08,380 --> 01:49:11,040
For more than your survival?

974
01:49:11,220 --> 01:49:14,520
Can you tell me what it is?
Do you even know?

975
01:49:17,960 --> 01:49:19,720
Is it freedom or truth?

976
01:49:19,890 --> 01:49:22,260
Perhaps peace? Could it be for love?

977
01:49:22,430 --> 01:49:25,830
Illusions, Mr. Anderson.
Vagaries of perception.

978
01:49:26,230 --> 01:49:29,290
Temporary constructs
of a feeble human intellect...

979
01:49:29,500 --> 01:49:34,340
...trying desperately to justify an existence
that is without meaning or purpose!

980
01:49:34,510 --> 01:49:37,940
And all of them as artificial
as the Matrix itself...

981
01:49:38,150 --> 01:49:44,280
...although only a human mind could
invent something as insipid as love.

982
01:49:46,790 --> 01:49:50,250
You must be able to see it, Mr. Anderson.
You must know it by now.

983
01:49:50,420 --> 01:49:53,620
You can't win.
It's pointless to keep fighting.

984
01:49:56,360 --> 01:49:59,630
Why, Mr. Anderson, why?
Why do you persist?

985
01:50:02,900 --> 01:50:05,130
Because I choose to.

986
01:51:10,100 --> 01:51:13,160
This is my world! My world!

987
01:51:37,830 --> 01:51:39,590
Wait.

988
01:51:39,770 --> 01:51:41,930
I've seen this.

989
01:51:43,140 --> 01:51:45,470
This is it. This is the end.

990
01:51:47,140 --> 01:51:51,040
Yes. You were laying right there,
just like that.

991
01:51:51,210 --> 01:51:53,540
And l....

992
01:51:53,710 --> 01:51:59,550
I stand here, right here,
and I'm supposed to say something.

993
01:51:59,720 --> 01:52:01,310
I say:

994
01:52:01,490 --> 01:52:05,020
"Everything that has a beginning
has an end, Neo."

995
01:52:13,770 --> 01:52:17,500
What? What did I just say?

996
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:26,740
No, no. This isn't right.
This can't be right.

997
01:52:34,220 --> 01:52:35,880
Get away from me!

998
01:52:36,060 --> 01:52:37,490
What are you afraid of?

999
01:52:38,360 --> 01:52:39,590
It's a trick.

1000
01:52:40,230 --> 01:52:42,490
You were right, Smith.

1001
01:52:43,400 --> 01:52:45,260
You were always right.

1002
01:52:48,570 --> 01:52:50,230
It was inevitable.

1003
01:53:22,040 --> 01:53:23,590
Is it over?

1004
01:53:54,640 --> 01:53:57,040
Oh, no, no, no.

1005
01:53:57,240 --> 01:53:58,730
No, it's not fair.

1006
01:54:53,030 --> 01:54:55,360
It is done.

1007
01:55:27,290 --> 01:55:29,590
It doesn't make sense.

1008
01:55:33,530 --> 01:55:35,200
He did it.

1009
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,200
He saved us.

1010
01:55:38,510 --> 01:55:40,630
He saved us.

1011
01:55:41,280 --> 01:55:44,510
It's over! He did it! He did it!

1012
01:55:44,750 --> 01:55:46,080
He did it! It's over!

1013
01:55:46,250 --> 01:55:48,740
It's over! He did it! He did it!

1014
01:55:48,920 --> 01:55:52,440
-What is it? What happened?
-Sir, he did it, sir. Neo, he did it.

1015
01:55:52,620 --> 01:55:54,090
-Did what?
-He ended the war.

1016
01:55:54,250 --> 01:55:56,190
The machines, they're gone.

1017
01:55:56,360 --> 01:55:59,690
The war is over, sir. The war is over.

1018
01:56:01,200 --> 01:56:04,630
Zion! Zion!

1019
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:06,560
Zion, it's over!

1020
01:56:06,870 --> 01:56:08,360
It's over!

1021
01:56:08,570 --> 01:56:11,200
The war is over!

1022
01:56:11,410 --> 01:56:14,240
The war is over!

1023
01:56:35,600 --> 01:56:38,530
I have imagined this moment...

1024
01:56:39,030 --> 01:56:41,330
...for so long.

1025
01:56:45,240 --> 01:56:47,040
Is this real?

1026
01:56:55,820 --> 01:56:58,650
Neo, wherever you are...

1027
01:56:59,650 --> 01:57:01,640
...thank you.

1028
01:57:45,630 --> 01:57:46,860
Good morning.

1029
01:58:08,090 --> 01:58:12,020
Well, now. Ain't this a surprise.

1030
01:58:12,430 --> 01:58:14,590
You played a very dangerous game.

1031
01:58:14,760 --> 01:58:17,030
Change always is.

1032
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:20,930
Just how long do you think
this peace is going to last?

1033
01:58:22,300 --> 01:58:24,500
As long as it can.

1034
01:58:27,810 --> 01:58:29,780
What about the others?

1035
01:58:31,480 --> 01:58:32,880
What others?

1036
01:58:33,050 --> 01:58:34,710
The ones that want out.

1037
01:58:35,480 --> 01:58:37,580
Obviously, they will be freed.

1038
01:58:38,150 --> 01:58:39,810
I have your word?

1039
01:58:39,990 --> 01:58:43,750
What do you think I am? Human?

1040
01:58:57,770 --> 01:58:59,330
Oracle!

1041
01:59:06,150 --> 01:59:08,310
We were afraid we might not find you.

1042
01:59:08,480 --> 01:59:11,140
Everything's okay now.

1043
01:59:11,650 --> 01:59:13,410
Look, look.

1044
01:59:13,990 --> 01:59:16,420
Just look at that.

1045
01:59:17,060 --> 01:59:19,720
Beautiful.

1046
01:59:20,660 --> 01:59:23,060
Did you do that?

1047
01:59:23,400 --> 01:59:25,560
For Neo.

1048
01:59:25,900 --> 01:59:27,890
That's nice.

1049
01:59:28,070 --> 01:59:29,760
I know he'd love it.

1050
01:59:30,440 --> 01:59:32,410
Will we ever see him again?

1051
01:59:33,040 --> 01:59:35,770
I suspect so.

1052
01:59:35,940 --> 01:59:37,670
Someday.

1053
01:59:42,450 --> 01:59:44,250
Did you always know?

1054
01:59:44,420 --> 01:59:47,720
Oh, no. No, I didn't.

1055
01:59:48,220 --> 01:59:50,780
But I believed.

1056
01:59:51,730 --> 01:59:54,130
I believed
