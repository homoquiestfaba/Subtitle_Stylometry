<font color="#ffff80">Hello, I'm Danielle Steel.</font>

00:00:03,374 --> 00:00:06,274
<font color="#ffff80">I'm glad you've joined us tonight
for Palamino.</font>

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,370
<font color="#ffff80">When I wrote Palomino,</font>

4
00:00:08,394 --> 00:00:11,594
<font color="#ffff80">I loved the idea of writing
a book about cowboys.</font>

photographer in New York,</font>

10
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,050
<font color="#ffff80">Thank you for being with us.</font>

11
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,850
That's it, okay...
keep looking, that's good...

12
00:00:36,974 --> 00:00:38,073
Good!

13
00:00:38,174 --> 00:00:39,174
Fabulous!

14
00:00:39,266 --> 00:00:41,156
A little more, a little more, that's it.

15
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,640
Go down a little bit.
Good, good.

16
00:00:43,664 --> 00:00:46,374
Good. I like it, I like it.
You'll drive the girls nuts. Uh-huh.

17
00:00:46,398 --> 00:00:47,398
Great.

18
00:00:47,622 --> 00:00:49,279
Great, right there, uh-huh.

19
00:00:49,603 --> 00:00:52,793
Just like if you can't get any better,
you go on something like this.

20
00:00:52,794 --> 00:00:54,994
If you ever change anything,
you're dead.

21
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,410
- You know it's 6 o'clock, right?
- Already?

22
00:00:58,434 --> 00:00:59,819
Mm, do you mind?

23
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,350
Of course not.

24
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,790
<i> - This is Warren Taylor. - And
Liz Corey and this is the evening news.</i>

25
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,730
<i> Among tonight's top stories,
are the Geneva Peace Summit. </i>

26
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,370
<i> On the domestic scene: New evidence
presented at a senate investigation,</i>

27
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,810
<i>indicates that the cost
to S&L bailout,</i>

28
00:01:17,834 --> 00:01:20,234
<i>will be even higher
than previously thought.</i>

29
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,170
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

30
00:01:28,194 --> 00:01:29,493
You're home early.

31
00:01:29,494 --> 00:01:32,094
The dinner with the network brass
got cancelled.

32
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:37,070
I'm beat. You mind if we eat out tonight?
I could just call Marty and Jim...

33
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,130
Sam, don't. I don't want to
have dinner with friends...

34
00:01:40,154 --> 00:01:41,954
I want us to talk.

35
00:01:44,535 --> 00:01:45,635
Okay.

36
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,090
What is it? You look so serious.

37
00:01:48,114 --> 00:01:51,014
I don't know how to say this...
I don't even know where to begin.

38
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,670
Say what?

39
00:01:52,694 --> 00:01:54,694
I want out of this marriage.

40
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,570
I didn't mean for it
to happen this way.

41
00:01:57,594 --> 00:02:00,179
I don't even know
how it started, it just...

42
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,030
Is there someone else?

43
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,330
Who is she? Do I know her?

44
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:10,960
It's Liz.

45
00:02:10,984 --> 00:02:12,984
Oh... god.

46
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,890
How could you... do that?

47
00:02:15,914 --> 00:02:19,264
Look, I tried to break it off,
several times, but

48
00:02:19,288 --> 00:02:20,688
I can't.

49
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,170
Do you love her?

50
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,650
Answer me!

51
00:02:27,774 --> 00:02:29,059
Yes.

52
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,870
How long has this been going on?

53
00:02:31,894 --> 00:02:33,594
Almost a year now.

54
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:39,590
Look, I'm sorry, I know I should've
told you about this a long time ago...

55
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,310
Don't touch me!

56
00:02:41,734 --> 00:02:44,134
I don't want to hurt you, Sam.

57
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,650
That's what makes it so hard.

58
00:02:46,974 --> 00:02:49,474
It's because I can't have a baby,
isn't it?

59
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,210
That has nothing to do with this.

60
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,490
Wh... what are you doing?

61
00:02:59,514 --> 00:03:01,099
You don't have to leave tonight...

62
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,410
I have to decide what I'm gonna do.
I can't do that here.

63
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,120
Well, no-one ever
works out anything apart.

64
00:03:08,244 --> 00:03:10,544
Oh, you're leaving because
you're going to her.

65
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,530
You've already made the decision,
haven't you?

66
00:03:12,554 --> 00:03:15,239
You know things have not been right
between us for some time!

67
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,250
Don't tell me what I know!

68
00:03:17,374 --> 00:03:19,774
Because I'll tell you what I thought.

69
00:03:19,798 --> 00:03:23,368
I thought you were faithful to me. I
thought that our marriage mattered to you.

70
00:03:23,454 --> 00:03:25,739
I thought if I had a problem
because I couldn't have kids,

71
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,070
we would overcome it.
I thought...

72
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,190
you loved me.

73
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,610
<font color="#ffff80">SEVERAL MONTHS LATER</font>

74
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,050

00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,590
<i> Please join us tomorrow for part 2</i>

76
00:04:19,614 --> 00:04:22,414
<i>on our continuing series
on mothers in the workplace.</i>

77
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,090
<i> And before we close, we would like
to make a formal announcement</i>

78
00:04:25,114 --> 00:04:28,114
<i>of what may have been apparent
to most of you for some time now:</i>

79
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,090
<i>Liz and I are expecting
our first child in a few months. </i>

80
00:04:31,114 --> 00:04:32,999
<i>Hopefully not with
on-the-air coverage.</i>

81
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,120
<i>Liz will be working with our news team
until the very end of her pregnancy.</i>

82
00:04:36,144 --> 00:04:38,344
<i>Only if I can fit behind this desk.</i>

83
00:04:38,368 --> 00:04:40,368
<i>- From all of us
- Goodnight.</i>

84
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,350
- Yeah, who is it?
- It's me. You okay?

85
00:04:54,184 --> 00:04:56,674
- Did you see the news?
- Hm.

86
00:04:56,698 --> 00:04:57,797
Sorry.

87
00:04:58,098 --> 00:05:00,159
I- I didn't know what to bring you.

88
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,090
You know what, a punching bag?

89
00:05:02,114 --> 00:05:04,814
A case of Tequila? Or a big cheesecake?

90
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,950
- Oh, watch out for this glass. - What
happened here, huh? Or shouldn't I ask?

91
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,030
Does he think I'm a fool,
Charlie?

92
00:05:10,054 --> 00:05:12,954
Didn't he think I'd be able to figure out
she was pregnant when he left me?

93
00:05:12,978 --> 00:05:15,639
Why couldn't he have been honest,
why couldn't he have told me himself?

94
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,330
Because he's a coward, right?
Among other things.

95
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,550
I can't stop thinking about him. I can't
even stop watching that damn news show.

96
00:05:21,574 --> 00:05:23,874
Well, don't do that to yourself,
that's just dumb.

97
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,150
You know Sam, you've got to get out
of here. You've got to get on with it.

98
00:05:27,174 --> 00:05:29,574
How am I supposed
to do that, huh?

99
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,970
I'm supposed to pretend the last
7 years of my life didn't matter?

100
00:05:32,971 --> 00:05:34,756
Of course they matter.

101
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:37,530
What you got to do is you got to focus,
on your work, on your and friends,

102
00:05:37,554 --> 00:05:39,239
on the things
that make you happy.

103
00:05:39,263 --> 00:05:43,393
This announcement that they made, it's
gonna generate a lot of interest, okay?

104
00:05:43,617 --> 00:05:45,937
So I was thinking that, uh...

105
00:05:45,961 --> 00:05:49,161
maybe it's not such a bad idea
to get out of town for a few weeks...

106
00:05:49,185 --> 00:05:52,015
Ohh, what? And do what? Go lie on
a beach in Florida somewhere?

107
00:05:52,074 --> 00:05:54,559
Oh, no, no, that's not my style.

108
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,090
Sam, Life Magazine...

109
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,630
Right?

110
00:05:58,654 --> 00:06:01,954
Life Magazine is doing a photo
layout on the American cowboy.

111
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,650
Now they're talking about
using a freelancer.

112
00:06:04,974 --> 00:06:07,074
Are you interested?

113
00:06:07,098 --> 00:06:08,479
Mm...

114
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,090
- When do they want it?
- Immediately.

115
00:06:11,114 --> 00:06:12,199
Hm.

116
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,010
- Have they chosen a location?
- No.

117
00:06:15,034 --> 00:06:17,434
They're leaving that
up to the photographer.

118
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:18,558
Mm.

119
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:25,870
You remember my telling you about
my friend, Barbara Lord, from college?

120
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,570
Yeah. The one that
died in a plane crash.

121
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,210
Her mother, Caroline Lord,

122
00:06:30,234 --> 00:06:33,234
still owns one of the most
successful ranches in California.

123
00:06:33,258 --> 00:06:35,488
You think she'd
let you shoot there?

124
00:06:35,574 --> 00:06:37,274
I bet she would.

125
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,950
Wow, hard to believe
we're only 4 hours from L.A.

126
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:50,174
Feels more like half a century,
don't it?

127
00:06:50,198 --> 00:06:51,459
Yeah, it's true.

128
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,150
You know, Miss Caroline,

129
00:06:53,274 --> 00:06:55,474
she just can't wait to see you.

130
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:58,070
You know,
of all her daughter's friends,

131
00:06:58,094 --> 00:06:59,479
you were the favourite.

132
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,820
Well, I've missed her.

133
00:07:00,844 --> 00:07:03,544
- Does she still have her Arabians?
- Oh, sure...

134
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,910
Morgans, quarter horses,

135
00:07:05,934 --> 00:07:08,334
we just got 4 new thoroughbreds.

136
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:11,910
You know, most of the ranchers around
here are content with just their cattle,

137
00:07:12,034 --> 00:07:13,734
not miss Caroline.

138
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,030
She's about the best horse woman
I ever saw.

139
00:07:17,054 --> 00:07:20,454
No, wait, I do recall, you
weren't so chatty yourself, then.

140
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:24,790
Oh, I've always admired the way
Caroline was able to change.

141
00:07:24,814 --> 00:07:26,414
Turn her life around.

142
00:07:26,438 --> 00:07:28,638
How many people can do that?

143
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,130
I never knew her
when she lived in L.A. but

144
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:34,460
it's not hard to imagine her married
to a film director and giving parties

145
00:07:34,484 --> 00:07:36,684
and going to screenings...

146
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,330
you know,

147
00:07:38,354 --> 00:07:41,154
it's a world away
from running a ranch.

148
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:55,990
- I'll cool him down for you, ma'am.
- Give him a good rub down, Josh.

149
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,370
Oh, I've had some wonderful times here.

150
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,850
Samantha!

151
00:08:07,175 --> 00:08:08,975
Oh... Samantha!

152
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,810
I'm so glad to see you again.

153
00:08:13,434 --> 00:08:15,019
Welcome home.

154
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,910
You look wonderful.

155
00:08:16,934 --> 00:08:19,734
Why is it I'm the only one
who ever seems to get any older?

156
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:22,290
Oh, you look the same to me
as you did when you were...

157
00:08:22,314 --> 00:08:24,814
18 years old, riding quarter horses.

158
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,320
Well, he's a beautiful animal.

159
00:08:28,744 --> 00:08:31,044
His name is "My Solitaire".

160
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,810
I like the look of an Arabian but

161
00:08:33,834 --> 00:08:36,334
I love to ride a thoroughbred.

162
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:40,170
Of course, uh, it's a little crazy
at my age to buy something like that

163
00:08:40,294 --> 00:08:42,294
oh, a final extravagance

164
00:08:42,318 --> 00:08:44,368
but what the hell, I had to do it!

165
00:08:44,392 --> 00:08:46,792
Come on, let's get you
out of those city clothes.

166
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,910
Well, you all set, Sam?

167
00:08:50,134 --> 00:08:53,633
- Will you be needing anything else?
- No, thanks Bill, we'll be fine.

168
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,850
Then I'll see you two ladies
in the morning.

169
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:03,090
Bill's been your foreman now
for what, uh... 20 years?

170
00:09:03,214 --> 00:09:04,714
24.

171
00:09:04,738 --> 00:09:05,899
Oh.

172
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,110
Not much has changed since you left.

173
00:09:08,134 --> 00:09:11,134
Well, good. I'd be
terribly disappointed if it had.

174
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:18,890
There's not much more to say
than what I said the other night.

175
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,770
The divorce was so awful.

176
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:24,194
So... public.

177
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:28,270
- Have you been out with anyone
since the break-up?  - No.

178
00:09:28,294 --> 00:09:29,779
Why not?

179
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,790
I'm... not ready.

180
00:09:31,814 --> 00:09:34,014
I don't think I ever will be.

181
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,190
I felt the same way
after my husband died.

182
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,230
But Sam, your life isn't over.

183
00:09:41,254 --> 00:09:43,854
In some ways it's just begun.

184
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,800
We'd better get some sleep.

185
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:51,260
You have a big day tomorrow and
Bill has made all the arrangements,

186
00:09:51,284 --> 00:09:55,314
the men are expecting you and they
ride out of here at the crack of dawn.

187
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,820
Thanks for everything,
Caroline, really.

188
00:09:58,844 --> 00:10:00,844
I'm so glad you're here.

189
00:10:03,468 --> 00:10:06,268
...the horse comes over
and he grabs his halter...

190
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,870
You must be Miss Lord's friend
from New York.

191
00:10:31,894 --> 00:10:32,779
Yeah.

192
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:36,250
That's right. Samantha Taylor.
But everybody calls me Sam.

193
00:10:36,274 --> 00:10:38,474
Tate Jordan, Assistant Foreman.

194
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,980
I appreciate you
letting me ride with you today.

195
00:10:41,004 --> 00:10:43,604
Whatever Miss Lord's wants
is fine with me.

196
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:47,210
But I guess she didn't tell you how soon
we get started in the morning around here.

197
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,440
Only gonna have time
for about half that cup of coffee.

198
00:10:50,464 --> 00:10:52,464
Half a cup's all I need.

199
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:55,550
What exactly is it
you're looking for out here?

200
00:10:55,574 --> 00:10:59,374
I just want to watch you work,
take a few pictures, that's it.

201
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:03,860
Well, today we're gonna be around
enough cows for the winter feed.

202
00:11:04,156 --> 00:11:05,756
Sounds fine.

203
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:09,460
I don't know what's so interesting about
watching a bunch of cowboys get dirty.

204
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:13,590
Well, maybe not to someone
who works on a ranch, but, uh...

205
00:11:14,023 --> 00:11:16,263
to the rest of the country
who's still in love

206
00:11:16,287 --> 00:11:19,687
with the idea of the cowboy
riding the range, you know?

207
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,490
How long's it been
since you've ridden?

208
00:11:23,914 --> 00:11:25,514
A while.

209
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,230
But don't worry.

210
00:11:29,454 --> 00:11:31,239
I can ride.

211
00:11:31,763 --> 00:11:33,039
Yeah.

212
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:37,170
Josh, why don't you saddle up
the Lady for Miss Taylor?

213
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,830
- How are you holding up?
- Oh, I'm just fine.

214
00:11:53,178 --> 00:11:56,178
but you know, you might consider
renaming this horse

215
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,850
"Grandma" might be more appropriate.

216
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,300
I could've handled an animal
with a little more spirit.

217
00:12:02,424 --> 00:12:03,924
Let's go.

218
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:16,670
Well now, if it ain't your
great American cowboy.

219
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:19,190
That's enough out of you, Josh.

220
00:13:19,214 --> 00:13:23,314
It's a shame to break in a brand new pair
of boots in a field full of cow paddies.

221
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,370
Why don't you all take a break.

222
00:13:25,394 --> 00:13:28,994
We're gonna give, uh, Miss Taylor
a minute here to clean up her new boots.

223
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,550
Hey.

224
00:13:32,774 --> 00:13:34,974
I don't care whether
you like me or not.

225
00:13:34,998 --> 00:13:38,198
If you have a problem with my being here,
then we really need to talk about it.

226
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:41,450
The only problem I have is with that
steer and he's back in the corral.

227
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:44,250
Look, I really need your
cooperation here, OK?

228
00:13:44,274 --> 00:13:46,574
Lady, I intend to cooperate.

229
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,660
Here you go, Sam.

230
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,670
What's his problem anyway?

231
00:13:57,694 --> 00:14:00,364
Oh,  he just ain't used to
working around women.

232
00:14:00,388 --> 00:14:01,388
Mm.

233
00:14:01,998 --> 00:14:04,098
Come on. Come on!

234
00:14:06,522 --> 00:14:08,122
Hi, Mrs Taylor.

235
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,750
How did it go today?

236
00:14:11,774 --> 00:14:13,974
- Mm. Honestly?
- Hm-mm.

237
00:14:14,198 --> 00:14:15,998
I can barely move.

238
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,120
How did the men treat you?

239
00:14:18,144 --> 00:14:20,444
Oh, about as well
as could be expected.

240
00:14:20,468 --> 00:14:21,539
Mm.

241
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:24,750
The magazine sent me
in search of images of the, uh,

242
00:14:24,774 --> 00:14:27,374
old cowboy in the new west.

243
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:30,010
I think they thought
he would be hard to find.

244
00:14:30,134 --> 00:14:32,534
You didn't have to look very far,
did you?

245
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:36,290
Oh, no. The spirit of John Wayne
is alive and well.

246
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:40,530
The men of this ranch they're hard working,
hard riding, down-to-the-core cowboys.

247
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:43,990
But they keep to themselves,
they're hard to predict.

248
00:14:44,014 --> 00:14:46,614
Even Bill. I never know quite
what he'll do next.

249
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,430
But over the years I've learned

250
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:52,154
that it's much simpler just to
accept things the way they are.

251
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,510
You are gonna be
in agony tomorrow.

252
00:14:54,534 --> 00:14:57,734
Oh, no I'm not. I'm gonna be
back on that damn horse.

253
00:14:57,758 --> 00:14:59,758
Hopefully a better horse.

254
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:03,710
Oh, listen, why don't you take a break
from your work and ride My Solitaire
in the morning?

255
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,790
- Yeah, you mean it?
- I think you've earned it.

256
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:17,130
Tate, do you mind if I start one more
roll of film before I call it a day?

257
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,630
Yes ma'am, we would.

258
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:25,054
It's one thing for you to ride with us,
but this is private.

259
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:28,630
Even the other men's wives
don't come in here in the evenings.

260
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,230
Sorry.

261
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:49,930
Sam, I think you'll find My Solitaire
a far cry from Lady.

262
00:15:49,954 --> 00:15:51,554
Thanks, Josh.

263
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:57,040
You have a good ride.

264
00:16:30,835 --> 00:16:32,535
Oh, good morning.

265
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,650
Do you always ride like that?

266
00:16:34,674 --> 00:16:35,773
Sometimes.

267
00:16:35,774 --> 00:16:38,374
Just to show off,
or you like taking chances?

268
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:41,070
Well, I don't think that's
really any of your business.

269
00:16:41,094 --> 00:16:42,879
Well, you made it my business.

270
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:45,400
Now you like it or not,
I'm responsible for you.

271
00:16:45,424 --> 00:16:48,524
You don't know that horse well enough to
pull that kinda stunt you did over there.

272
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,770
You could've hurt yourself,
crippled this horse.

273
00:16:50,794 --> 00:16:52,894
Yeah, well, I appreciate your concern

274
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,790
but Caroline would never hold you
responsible for what I do on horse,

275
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:57,499
she knows me too well.

276
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,840
Maybe she's never seen you
ride like that.

277
00:16:59,864 --> 00:17:00,959
OK.

278
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,420
Look, I'm not saying
what I did was right,

279
00:17:03,444 --> 00:17:06,044
making that jump
made me feel alive again.

280
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,970
I don't care what you
were doin' out there,

281
00:17:07,994 --> 00:17:10,794
nothing's worth risking your life,
or this horse's.

282
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:14,070
Now, if you don't mind, I would like
to escort you back to the ranch.

283
00:17:14,094 --> 00:17:16,579
Mm, thanks very much,
but I prefer to ride alone.

284
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:20,230
And I would prefer that you
get back to the house in one piece.

285
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,580
What is it with you anyway?

286
00:17:24,604 --> 00:17:27,804
Don't you think I ride well enough
to handle this horse?

287
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,350
It takes more than being good
to handle a thoroughbred.

288
00:17:31,374 --> 00:17:33,574
Takes caution and strength.

289
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,150
Right now I'm not sure
you're long on either of them.

290
00:17:37,674 --> 00:17:39,274
Shall we?

291
00:17:51,835 --> 00:17:53,535
Come on, kids.

292
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,910
Ah, now we're talkin'.

293
00:18:01,935 --> 00:18:03,735
Excuse me, my lady.

294
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:11,630
It's been wonderful to have my dear friend
Samantha here for the past few weeks.

295
00:18:11,826 --> 00:18:14,296
And as I look across to see,

296
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,610
I am indeed very, very thankful

297
00:18:17,734 --> 00:18:21,334
to each and every one of you
here at my table.

298
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,950
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Happy Thanksgiving.

299
00:18:23,998 --> 00:18:25,498
- Hear, hear.
- Hear, hear.

300
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,690
Wait, wait a second...

301
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,610
Here's to all them fat cattle,

302
00:18:32,634 --> 00:18:35,234
and all them long-stepping horses -

303
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,450
and a day off from both of them.

304
00:18:37,474 --> 00:18:38,774
Yeah!

305
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,950
- You know, Sam...
- Mm-hm.

306
00:18:43,974 --> 00:18:45,859
that long blonde mane of yours

307
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:48,290
you kind of remind me of a palomino.

308
00:18:48,414 --> 00:18:52,214
Oh, Bill,you keep that up and I'll have to
add my name to your dance card tonight.

309
00:18:52,238 --> 00:18:53,488
Wait a minute now,

310
00:18:53,512 --> 00:18:57,312
if that's how you get a dance around here,
I got a real nice compliment for you Sam.

311
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:01,410
Tate here says that you ride better
than half of the hands on this ranch.

312
00:19:01,434 --> 00:19:03,834
Coming from him, that's high praise.

313
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,910
Oh, you said that, hm?

314
00:19:07,834 --> 00:19:10,334
Not exactly in those words.

315
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:22,930
♪  ♪

316
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,010
You look at her...

317
00:19:41,034 --> 00:19:43,834
looking up up at that old old cowboy
like he was Tom Selleck.

318
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:48,150
Yeah, Bill's very popular. I'll
have to wait all night for my dance.

319
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,710
Where's your family tonight?

320
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,070
Well, my boy is 18...

321
00:19:55,094 --> 00:19:57,894
he's working on a ranch in Arizona.

322
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,290
What about your wife?

323
00:20:00,714 --> 00:20:02,199
Ex-wife.

324
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,900
She's in Washington state somewhere.

325
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,930
What about your family?

326
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:15,430
My mother passed away a few years ago,

327
00:20:15,454 --> 00:20:17,954
my father when I was very young.

328
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:21,250
I don't really have any family left.

329
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,410
Uh, excuse me...

330
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:38,234
I need to get some more film.

331
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,830
I don't want to miss... the sunset.

332
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,170
What's he doing out there?

333
00:21:12,194 --> 00:21:13,879
Watching the herd.

334
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,370
The coyotes have been coming down
out of the hills since the drought.

335
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:22,370
You guys spend a lot of time
alone out there, don't you?

336
00:21:22,994 --> 00:21:25,194
Do you ever get lonely?

337
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,890
There's a difference between
being "alone" and being "lonely".

338
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,810
Anybody who does this kind of work's
gotta be comfortable with his own company.

339
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,050
Want to look?

340
00:21:41,098 --> 00:21:42,398
Huh!

341
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,830
When we first met, you, uh...

342
00:21:46,954 --> 00:21:49,354
really hated me, didn't you?

343
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,030
I did.

344
00:21:51,154 --> 00:21:53,354
What made you change your mind?

345
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,310
The way I acted had
more to do with me than to you.

346
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,050
How so?

347
00:22:00,074 --> 00:22:03,074
Let's just say I'm superstitious
about cameras.

348
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,250
What do you mean?

349
00:22:05,274 --> 00:22:07,874
Some people don't like
having their picture taken.

350
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,650
Well, I hate having mine taken.

351
00:22:10,974 --> 00:22:13,374
But I don't think that's it.

352
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,390
Maybe I was, uh...
afraid of what you'd see.

353
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,870
Ooh, well, you make it sound
very mystical.

354
00:22:22,394 --> 00:22:24,994
You afraid I'd capture your soul?

355
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,730
My soul wasn't what I was worried about.

356
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,050
I should, um...
check on the horses.

357
00:22:36,174 --> 00:22:39,374
And I guess I should...
get back to the party.

358
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,190
See you later.

359
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,170
Sam...

360
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,550
whatcha doing on Sunday?

361
00:22:55,174 --> 00:22:57,974
I thought I might take the horse
out to the North Pasture.

362
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,370
It's a nice ride.

363
00:23:00,394 --> 00:23:02,594
If you follow the ridge.

364
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,970
I'll keep it in mind.

365
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:16,870
Come in.

366
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,050
Happy Thanksgiving, honey.

367
00:23:24,074 --> 00:23:25,874
Happy Thanksgiving.

368
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,860
Mornin'.

369
00:23:44,884 --> 00:23:45,984
Hi.

370
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:00,160
Are you gonna be staying on
much longer?

371
00:24:00,184 --> 00:24:01,656
Uh, I don't know.

372
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,970
I'm not that anxious to get back.

373
00:24:03,994 --> 00:24:05,694
Why is that?

374
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,770
It's a long story.

375
00:24:09,394 --> 00:24:11,294
I got all day.

376
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,150
I just got divorced.

377
00:24:16,774 --> 00:24:18,774
My husband...

378
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:21,298
left me for another woman.

379
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,750
I know how that feels.

380
00:24:25,074 --> 00:24:28,174
My ex-wife left me
almost 18 years ago.

381
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,350
Took my little boy
and ran off with some fella

382
00:24:31,374 --> 00:24:33,774
that worked on the oil rig in the gulf.

383
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,790
Still think about her
every now and then.

384
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,260
Nobody bothers to
look at the sky in New York.

385
00:24:42,284 --> 00:24:44,384
Even if they could find it.

386
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,510
You don't miss the city?

387
00:24:46,534 --> 00:24:49,234
Well, see the thing about New York
is that it's addictive.

388
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,330
Once you break the habit
you're alright. But...

389
00:24:52,354 --> 00:24:54,754
when you're hooked, look out.

390
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,990
It sounds like a couple of
women I've known.

391
00:24:58,014 --> 00:24:58,776
Hm.

392
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,050
Like your ex-wife?

393
00:25:01,974 --> 00:25:03,174
Yeah.

394
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,330
That's in the past.

395
00:25:06,354 --> 00:25:08,654
I don't want to talk about her.

396
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:15,020
Remember the other day when
Bill said you look like a palomino?

397
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,890
He was right.

398
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,270
You have got the prettiest hair
I've ever seen.

399
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,330
It's, uh...

400
00:25:27,354 --> 00:25:29,154
gettin' late.

401
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,150
Do you want some coffee?

402
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,710
You say that like you know a place
right around the corner.

403
00:25:38,734 --> 00:25:40,434
Well, I do.

404
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,530
Whose is this?

405
00:26:07,554 --> 00:26:09,354
Take a look.

406
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,010
"William B. King.
1949 Rodeo."

407
00:26:21,934 --> 00:26:24,134
Is it Bill's cabin?

408
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,850
Should we be here?

409
00:26:26,874 --> 00:26:29,674
Ever since I found the place,
I can't stay away from it.

410
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,650
Yes, I can see why.

411
00:26:31,774 --> 00:26:33,974
I'm making some coffee.

412
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,960
Look at these these photos!

413
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,770
- It's theirs, isn't it?
- I think so.

414
00:27:18,818 --> 00:27:20,818
- Does anyone else know?
- About them?

415
00:27:20,842 --> 00:27:23,042
I'm not sure. They've
been awful careful.

416
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,610
Yet, Barbara and I used to
talk about it for hours.

417
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,770
convincing ourselves there was something
going on between the 2 of them

418
00:27:28,794 --> 00:27:31,594
and then talking ourselves out of it
again. But we were never certain.

419
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:35,410
I wonder...
why they kept it a secret for so long?

420
00:27:35,434 --> 00:27:37,734
Why they haven't gotten married?

421
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,990
Well, this isn't New York.

422
00:27:40,014 --> 00:27:41,276
So?

423
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:46,160
I mean, lady ranchers don't take up
housekeeping with their foreman.

424
00:27:46,184 --> 00:27:47,656
Why not?

425
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,680
It'd be beneath her
to marry Bill.

426
00:27:49,704 --> 00:27:51,776
Oh, come on,
how can you say that?

427
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:56,640
Bill has got an 8th grade education
and about $1.22 to his name.

428
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,230
I don't think that matters
to Caroline.

429
00:27:59,254 --> 00:28:01,216
Well, it matters to Bill.

430
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,290
Will you take a look at this.
Real records.

431
00:28:04,314 --> 00:28:06,714
Don't see many of these anymore.

432
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,120
It looks Italian.

433
00:28:09,244 --> 00:28:11,644
Opera. It must be hers.

434
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,870
Bob Wills and The Texas Playboys.

435
00:28:14,994 --> 00:28:17,076
Oh, definitely Bills.

436
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,710
I kinda like this one myself.

437
00:28:23,058 --> 00:28:28,058
♪  ♪

438
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:39,050
You know, I wanted to ask you
to dance the other night.

439
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,950
But I was afraid that you'd say no.

440
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,390
You were wrong.

441
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,690
Do you know how much I want you?

442
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,250
That isn't enough.

443
00:29:41,274 --> 00:29:42,750
Well, I...

444
00:29:42,874 --> 00:29:45,074
I understand, but...

445
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,160
I...

446
00:29:47,284 --> 00:29:50,284
don't offer anything
more than that anymore.

447
00:29:50,908 --> 00:29:52,908
Why is that?

448
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,160
I don't have... any more to give.

449
00:29:59,784 --> 00:30:02,784
When was the last time you tried?

450
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,110
What do you want?

451
00:30:08,134 --> 00:30:10,334
A perfect romance?

452
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,970
A wedding ring on your finger
before you go to bed?

453
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,210
What do you want, cowboy?

454
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:21,634
A quick roll in the hay?

455
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,190
I'm sorry...

456
00:30:38,714 --> 00:30:40,714
I like you a lot.

457
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,650
I just don't want to get hurt again.

458
00:30:43,674 --> 00:30:46,674
I can't promise you that.
Nobody can.

459
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:50,830
What I want is something real.
I want what they have.

460
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:54,090
Do you think they were so sure
of themselves in the beginning?

461
00:30:54,114 --> 00:30:57,714
Hell, no. She was a rancher and he
was a ranch hand, that's all they knew.

462
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,650
No. But they also knew
they were in love.

463
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:06,670
Well, I wish I could give you the
kind of guarantees you're looking for.

464
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:25,790
I've talked it over with Caroline, Charlie,
I've decided to stay a little while longer.

465
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,570
Mm, tell him I've got a conflict.

466
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,470
Oh, uh, Charlie, I gotta go.

467
00:31:39,094 --> 00:31:41,894
Listen, have some fun,
relax a little bit.

468
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:44,590
Oh, and don't forget
to water my plants.

469
00:31:44,714 --> 00:31:47,014
I'll talk to you later in the week.

470
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:52,220
Josh told me that Caroline drove
down to L.A. for the night and

471
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,070
I just want to make sure you're alright.

472
00:31:56,280 --> 00:32:00,150
Would you like to come down
and have dinner at the hall?

473
00:32:00,174 --> 00:32:03,774
Oh, well, I thought women
weren't allowed in the hall.

474
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:07,590
Yeah well, sometimes-sometimes
you got to make an exception.

475
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:12,510
Well, I wouldn't want to compromise you,
get you in trouble with the other hands.

476
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:17,230
How about you stay and
have dinner here with me, instead?

477
00:32:17,254 --> 00:32:20,054
Caroline has left more
than enough food for 2 people.

478
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:22,290
Are you sure that's alright?

479
00:32:22,414 --> 00:32:25,814
Oh, um, yeah,
I'm sure she wouldn't mind.

480
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,830
Come on in.

481
00:32:36,676 --> 00:32:39,676
[INAUDIBLE]

482
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,890
Well, you've seen one duck,
you've seen them all.

483
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,530
There's something I wanted
to ask you all night long.

484
00:32:49,554 --> 00:32:51,316
Go ahead.

485
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,160
Who's Charlie?

486
00:32:54,084 --> 00:32:56,284
Is he your boyfriend?

487
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,370
He's my agent.

488
00:33:00,694 --> 00:33:02,136
Um...

489
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:05,410
I haven't been out with anyone
since my husband.

490
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:10,530
You know, if it wasn't so dark out
we could ride out to the cabin.

491
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,920
I better start cleaning the kitchen up.

492
00:33:16,944 --> 00:33:18,144
Sam.

493
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,770
I never thought I'd say this
to anyone again.

494
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,910
I love you.

495
00:33:29,975 --> 00:33:31,575
Well, uh...

496
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,260
are you're just saying that
because I told you that

497
00:33:35,584 --> 00:33:38,584
making love wasn't enough for me?

498
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:43,130
I said it because I mean it.

499
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:47,610
I've been thinking about you a lot
the last couple of days.

500
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,790
And what you want hasn't been
any different than what I feel.

501
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:59,410
Just that you... well, you want me
to put words to my feelings and

502
00:33:59,834 --> 00:34:02,234
I'm not used to doing that.

503
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,720
It's easier for me to say that I...

504
00:34:06,944 --> 00:34:09,444
I want to make love to you

505
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,590
than it is to say I love you.

506
00:34:14,175 --> 00:34:15,575
But Sam,

507
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:19,830
I've never met a woman that I've
wanted as much as I want you.

508
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:40,470


509
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,490
Morning.

510
00:36:06,514 --> 00:36:08,914
Oh. Was that Charlie on the phone?

511
00:36:08,938 --> 00:36:13,368
Yes. He's calmed down considerably since
he spoke with the senior editor at Life.

512
00:36:13,392 --> 00:36:15,192
We got the cover.

513
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,430
Congratulations.

514
00:36:17,454 --> 00:36:19,654
This is the shot they're using.

515
00:36:19,655 --> 00:36:20,495
Whoo.

516
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,610
There is just something...

517
00:36:22,634 --> 00:36:25,134
about a man wearing a Stetson.

518
00:36:25,295 --> 00:36:27,295
Of course, some men
wear hats better than others.

519
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,750
How's about joining me
for some coffee?

520
00:36:29,774 --> 00:36:32,736
Oh, no thanks. I've got a horse
waiting for me at the stables.

521
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:36,210
Where are you off to this morning?
Another long, lonely ride?

522
00:36:36,234 --> 00:36:38,634
Oh, I'm never lonely
when I'm out there.

523
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,610
Especially not when I'm riding.

524
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,550
I've decided to stay...

525
00:37:07,074 --> 00:37:09,474
a little while longer.

526
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,330
Maybe for Christmas.

527
00:37:13,016 --> 00:37:16,516
Well, that's pretty wonderful news.
You did that for me?

528
00:37:17,594 --> 00:37:19,256
For us.

529
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,450
I don't want to think about leaving
just yet.

530
00:37:22,674 --> 00:37:24,674
Well then, don't.

531
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,580
What we got right now
is what matters.

532
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,130
Well, I was wondering...

533
00:37:34,254 --> 00:37:35,754
do we, um...

534
00:37:35,778 --> 00:37:38,578
have to keep it a secret until then?

535
00:37:38,602 --> 00:37:39,416
Hm?

536
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,490
Well, we better keep
this a secret forever.

537
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,070
Look, no one knows
about us right now.

538
00:37:46,094 --> 00:37:49,694
It's better for you that way
and that's the way I want to keep it.

539
00:37:50,975 --> 00:37:52,775
Oh, well,

540
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,150
I want to be proud
of what we have, not...

541
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:59,374
be afraid of someone finding out.

542
00:37:59,498 --> 00:38:00,776
Mm.

543
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,470
Well, we don't have to
cross that bridge just yet.

544
00:38:06,594 --> 00:38:08,594
Mm-hm...

545
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:13,510
But, uh, sooner or later they're
going to have to deal with it.

546
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,130
So are we.

547
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:23,200
I'm not...

548
00:38:23,224 --> 00:38:24,624
Caroline.

549
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,640
I won't sneak around forever.

550
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:37,150
No. Eventually, you'll...

551
00:38:37,174 --> 00:38:39,774
be going back to New York.

552
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,170
We better start thinking about
getting out of this tub,

553
00:38:46,194 --> 00:38:48,794
- and getting back to the ranch.
- Oh, no no, no, no.

554
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,250
No.

555
00:38:51,074 --> 00:38:52,774
Not yet.

556
00:38:53,298 --> 00:38:54,898
Mm-mm.

557
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,430
Not right now.

558
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,770
Looks good, huh?

559
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,950
I think she's in love.

560
00:40:03,974 --> 00:40:05,036
Mm.

561
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:06,990
Who with?

562
00:40:07,014 --> 00:40:08,414
Tate Jordan.

563
00:40:08,438 --> 00:40:09,638
Tate!

564
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,490
You don't have to worry about Tate.

565
00:40:14,514 --> 00:40:16,114
Why is that?

566
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,610
Well, he's not gonna make a move
on Sam. He knows better.

567
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:24,150
Well, 6 weeks ago I would've said Sam
was too sophisticated for him. But

568
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:28,250
when is being too... anything...
to stop people from falling in love?

569
00:40:28,274 --> 00:40:30,664
Oh, I don't know, I just know
you worry too much.

570
00:40:30,688 --> 00:40:33,188
Come on over here.
You just come and sit with me.

571
00:40:42,055 --> 00:40:43,855
Mm...

572
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:46,410
I guess I missed you today.

573
00:40:46,434 --> 00:40:48,734
I thought about you today, too.

574
00:40:48,758 --> 00:40:50,758
- Did you?
- Mm-hm.

575
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:54,370
Do you realise in the last 5 years

576
00:40:54,394 --> 00:40:57,994
we've only had Sunday breakfast
together about 18 times.

577
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:02,350
Ain't you got better things to do
than count our Sundays?

578
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:05,410
I'm tired of you leaving
in the middle of the night.

579
00:41:05,434 --> 00:41:07,834
I want you here every morning.

580
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,950
I want to sit down at the
breakfast table with you and

581
00:41:10,974 --> 00:41:13,574
see you across the table,
looking at me.

582
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,370
Watching me eat post toasties,
ain't all that glamorous, honey.

583
00:41:17,594 --> 00:41:19,294
I'm serious.

584
00:41:21,796 --> 00:41:22,996
Tell you,

585
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:26,070
you want to ride out to the cabin
next weekend? It's been a long time.

586
00:41:26,094 --> 00:41:28,656
- You want to do that?
- What I want...

587
00:41:29,674 --> 00:41:31,674
is to have breakfast with you

588
00:41:31,698 --> 00:41:34,498
every single morning
for the rest of our lives.

589
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,690
Will you marry me?

590
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,430
I am honoured

591
00:41:47,554 --> 00:41:50,354
to have been asked one more time.

592
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,910
Does that mean you're finally
going to say yes?

593
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:58,590
It means I just  love you too much
to do that to you.

594
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,570
Well, what should've done
is said just "to the hell with it all "

595
00:42:03,594 --> 00:42:05,394
and gotten married 20 years ago!

596
00:42:05,518 --> 00:42:06,456
Yeah.

597
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,290
Then folks would've been able to say
"well, she married beneath her".

598
00:42:09,314 --> 00:42:12,114
The flamin' guy showed some promise.
What would they say now?

599
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:15,390
Well, they'd say "she finally
married the love of her life."

600
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:19,070
They'd say she up and went crazy
and married the ranch foreman.

601
00:42:19,094 --> 00:42:21,056
Oh, for god's sake, Bill!

602
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:24,770
Nobody cares who you are
or who I am.

603
00:42:24,794 --> 00:42:27,194
They have their own problems.

604
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,370
This ranch

605
00:42:29,394 --> 00:42:33,194
works the way it does because
of who you are and who I am.

606
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,690
And it won't work if we change that.

607
00:42:37,655 --> 00:42:38,855
Hey.

608
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:44,090
Now I'm gonna take a shower
and then we go to bed.

609
00:42:44,114 --> 00:42:45,576
'Cause I'm tired.

610
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,450
I'm tired too.

611
00:42:48,474 --> 00:42:50,474
I'm tired of hiding.

612
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:58,590
You know how much I love you.

613
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:03,290
Now come on.
Let's talk about it some other time.

614
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:04,376
Hmph.

615
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,970
Come on. Maybe next year.

616
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,980
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

617
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:27,030
So, um, what would really happen,

618
00:43:27,054 --> 00:43:30,054
if Bill and everybody
found out about us?

619
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,070
Doesn't matter.

620
00:43:32,071 --> 00:43:32,969
Hm?

621
00:43:32,994 --> 00:43:34,256
Why?

622
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:37,110
Because they're not gonna find out.

623
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:41,050
I won't let that happen to you, Sam.

624
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:51,190
<i> This is Warren Taylor with the
special edition of late night news. </i>

625
00:43:51,214 --> 00:43:53,244
Do you like that guy?

626
00:43:54,654 --> 00:43:56,454
No, I don't.

627
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:01,930
Are you sure?
You're watching him pretty close.

628
00:44:01,954 --> 00:44:05,154
I thought he was the kind of guy
that women went crazy about.

629
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,270
I don't know why.

630
00:44:09,794 --> 00:44:11,894
You're much better lookin'.

631
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:15,880
And a lot more decent,
and caring.

632
00:44:15,904 --> 00:44:19,104
And a lot more understanding,
than he could ever be.

633
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:22,050
- You make it sound like you know him.
- I do.

634
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,390
He's my ex-husband.

635
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,610
That guy?

636
00:44:31,234 --> 00:44:33,434
You're Warren Taylor's wife?

637
00:44:33,596 --> 00:44:35,096
Ex-wife.

638
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:37,530
Why didn't you tell me that before?

639
00:44:37,554 --> 00:44:39,954
It didn't seem very important.

640
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,890
Are you sure that's it?

641
00:44:41,914 --> 00:44:43,714
What's the big deal?

642
00:44:43,738 --> 00:44:46,238
I don't even know
your ex-wife's first name.

643
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:50,570
I tell you this much, she's sure as hell
isn't some damn television celebrity.

644
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,510
Who I was married to
has nothing to do with us.

645
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:58,870
I'm not so sure about that.

646
00:44:59,194 --> 00:45:02,194
Do you know what felt just now
seeing him?

647
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,840
Nothing.

648
00:45:05,464 --> 00:45:09,464
For the first time in almost a year,
I didn't feel a damn thing.

649
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:13,810
Not sick or nervousness
or angry or left out. Nothing!

650
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:16,850
I don't care anymore....

651
00:45:16,874 --> 00:45:18,874
because I'm with you.

652
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,410
And you make me happy.

653
00:45:23,334 --> 00:45:25,634
How can you say that, Sam?

654
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,890
Here you are with a
broken down cowboy,

655
00:45:27,914 --> 00:45:30,714
who couldn't buy you
a cold beer on a hot night.

656
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:35,010
You're worth a million of him.

657
00:45:39,262 --> 00:45:40,462
Hey...

658
00:45:40,486 --> 00:45:43,176
what if I don't go back to New York?

659
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,470
I could... I could freelance from here.
I can work from anywhere.

660
00:45:46,494 --> 00:45:48,356
Other people do it, I can do it too.

661
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:50,650
It won't work, Sam.

662
00:45:50,974 --> 00:45:53,074
Well, why not?

663
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:56,870
Warren Taylor has
nothing to do with us.

664
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:03,230
Or are you just afraid
of a commitment?

665
00:46:03,854 --> 00:46:05,854
Maybe I should be.

666
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:09,680
You're a hell of a woman, Sam,

667
00:46:09,704 --> 00:46:11,676
and I love you.

668
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:14,150
But what have I got to offer you?

669
00:46:14,174 --> 00:46:17,374
Who says you have to
offer me anything?

670
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:20,690
What are you gonna do? Leave your job,
your friends, your apartment

671
00:46:20,714 --> 00:46:24,514
- and come shovel out a barn with me?
- Don't say it like that.

672
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,370
I love you.

673
00:46:29,094 --> 00:46:31,994
You gonna love me in 5 years, Sam?

674
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:37,190
See, this has been a little vacation
for you, but

675
00:46:37,214 --> 00:46:39,076
this is my life.

676
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,050
Year after year, it doesn't change.

677
00:46:43,374 --> 00:46:45,174
It's all I got.

678
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,050
Why don't you get dressed
and I'll take you home.

679
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:56,350
What, back to New York?

680
00:46:57,174 --> 00:46:59,674
Never mind the smart talk.

681
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,670
Just get dressed.

682
00:47:08,994 --> 00:47:11,194
I can't believe you.

683
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:19,020
I'm through listening to this
old-fashioned garbage!

684
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:26,090
- I'll walk you home.
- No.

685
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,610
You're wrong about me.

686
00:47:29,834 --> 00:47:31,534
About us.

687
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,310
I love you.

688
00:47:35,334 --> 00:47:37,934
And that should be enough.

689
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:56,150
Hey baby.

690
00:47:56,174 --> 00:47:57,774
Hey, sweetie.

691
00:47:59,715 --> 00:48:00,815
Uh...

692
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:03,270
someone gave us a note.

693
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:19,010
- Did you find out anything?
- No, not really.

694
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:22,450
After he left me early this morning,
he went into town,

695
00:48:22,474 --> 00:48:25,274
and cashed out all his accounts
and bought a truck.

696
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:27,350
I checked around
all the other ranches,

697
00:48:27,374 --> 00:48:30,174
and nobody knows anything
about where he has gone.

698
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,170
Hey, Sam.

699
00:48:33,194 --> 00:48:35,070
Sam, I truly am sorry.

700
00:48:35,094 --> 00:48:37,194
I'm just sorry it had to happen.

701
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:41,340
But you got to understand with a man like
this he decides to up and go he just goes.

702
00:48:41,364 --> 00:48:43,664
Mm, I see... yeah, well...

703
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,870
Thanks for trying, Bill.

704
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:52,900
Now, Caroline, don't you
look at me like that.

705
00:48:52,924 --> 00:48:54,696
Some things just
ain't meant to be.

706
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,330
Damn you, Bill!

707
00:48:56,554 --> 00:48:59,354
And damn all cowboys along with you!

708
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,570
How could he leave like that?

709
00:49:09,594 --> 00:49:11,656
He loved working on this ranch.

710
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,810
Well, maybe he loved you more.

711
00:49:13,834 --> 00:49:15,634
Maybe that's why he left.

712
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:18,520
I mean, what kind of life
would you have had with him here?

713
00:49:18,544 --> 00:49:21,144
How can you say that?
What about you and Bill?

714
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,810
Somehow you've made it work.

715
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:29,830
That is a miracle.

716
00:49:29,854 --> 00:49:31,816
Plain and simple.

717
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:34,290
But it is far from perfect.

718
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,870
I had finished leading one kind of life,
before I came to the ranch.

719
00:49:38,894 --> 00:49:41,594
I was honestly ready for another.

720
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,510
And I'm old enough to compromise.

721
00:49:44,534 --> 00:49:46,934
Now you don't have to
do that at your age.

722
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:51,150
Maybe it's time you
thought about going home, Sam.

723
00:49:51,174 --> 00:49:53,774
You've got a whole life
waiting for you back east.

724
00:49:53,798 --> 00:49:54,836
I know.

725
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:56,730
What about Tate?

726
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:00,730
What if he changes his mind,
what if he comes back?

727
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:05,310
Take it from me,
I have been waiting 20 years.

728
00:50:05,334 --> 00:50:07,934
Cowboys do not change their minds.

729
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,610
Thanks for everything.

730
00:50:31,634 --> 00:50:34,434
You really helped me
through a very hard time.

731
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:37,780
You take care of yourself.

732
00:50:37,804 --> 00:50:39,404
You too.

733
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:57,790
Let's you and me ride out to the cabin.

734
00:50:58,314 --> 00:51:00,314
When, this weekend?

735
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:01,870
Right now.

736
00:51:01,994 --> 00:51:04,194
In the middle of the afternoon?

737
00:51:04,218 --> 00:51:06,318
Are you losing your mind?

738
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:08,590
I'll meet you in an hour.

739
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:27,110
You're shooting the account
on Thursday, right?

740
00:51:27,134 --> 00:51:30,534
Yeah. The magazine wants something
terribly European-looking and sophisticated.

741
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:33,010
He, of course, wants to wear
a black leather jacket

742
00:51:33,034 --> 00:51:35,434
and quote unquote "American jeans".

743
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:39,390
Charlie, I expected things to be
different when I got back. I...

744
00:51:39,614 --> 00:51:42,014
maybe 'cause I felt differently.

745
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:43,590
Are you alright?

746
00:51:43,614 --> 00:51:44,776
No.

747
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:47,530
Oh, here they are.

748
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:52,310
That's Caroline.

749
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:56,280
This is Bill.

750
00:51:56,704 --> 00:51:58,804
Oh, that's great. Yeah.

751
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,950
Is that him?

752
00:52:04,174 --> 00:52:05,374
Yes.

753
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:22,900
Hi.

754
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:32,210
What's the matter, Bill?
Are you alright?

755
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:34,910
Shall I...
I'll get somebody to help.

756
00:52:34,934 --> 00:52:37,034
No, no, I don't need no help.
I'm alright.

757
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:39,290
- No, no, I'll get somebody.
- I don't need help.

758
00:52:39,314 --> 00:52:42,514
I ain't gonna die.
Gettin' down off this horse.

759
00:52:42,938 --> 00:52:44,138
Damn!

760
00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:47,130
There, yeah... ooh.

761
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:52,650
I've called Dr. Cooper,
and he's on his way.

762
00:52:52,674 --> 00:52:54,536
Ahh... Dr. Cooper.

763
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:56,336
You know...

764
00:52:57,460 --> 00:52:59,630
I'm so sorry, honey.

765
00:52:59,654 --> 00:53:01,254
For what?

766
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,650
Everything I didn't do.

767
00:53:04,074 --> 00:53:06,874
I don't have any regrets.

768
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:09,210
I've got enough for both of us.

769
00:53:09,234 --> 00:53:11,096
- Don't say that.
- No, honey...

770
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:13,350
just like you said...

771
00:53:13,874 --> 00:53:17,274
all those Sunday mornings
we missed together.

772
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,910
I wish I could give 'em back to you.

773
00:53:22,934 --> 00:53:25,434
All wrapped up in a fancy package.

774
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:33,330
All that time we shoulda had together.

775
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,010
You have given me more,

776
00:53:38,034 --> 00:53:42,634
than most people get in a whole
lifetime of Sunday mornings.

777
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:48,390
I love you, Bill.

778
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,670
Oh God, I love you, too.

779
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:59,440
Life wants to expand
my cowboy piece into a book.

780
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:01,610
They want to do
a coffee table edition

781
00:54:01,634 --> 00:54:05,234
of a day in the life of the new American
cowboy. It's gonna be a big shoot.

782
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:09,210
They're gonna bring in an entire crew
and 3 of the photographers beside myself.

783
00:54:09,234 --> 00:54:11,096
And even Charlie wants to come.

784
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:12,360
So...

785
00:54:12,556 --> 00:54:14,956
can we shoot at your ranch?

786
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:17,310
Well, any other time I'd say yes...

787
00:54:17,334 --> 00:54:20,034
- you know I'd love to see you.
- <i>You sound worried.</i>

788
00:54:20,034 --> 00:54:21,596
What's the matter?

789
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:24,090
Bill... had a mild heart attack.

790
00:54:24,114 --> 00:54:25,714
Oh, no.

791
00:54:25,738 --> 00:54:28,338
Is he OK? Can I do anything?

792
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,730
<i>He had a bypass several years ago</i>

793
00:54:30,754 --> 00:54:33,354
I don't know if they're gonna
do another one or not, and uh,

794
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,650
Well, I'm just afraid
if you shot the book here,

795
00:54:35,774 --> 00:54:38,774
he would want to be all over the place,
trying to make things perfect.

796
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,650
You know how he is.

797
00:54:41,274 --> 00:54:43,274
- Are you alright?
- <i>Yes.</i>

798
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:45,180
Don't worry about us.

799
00:54:45,204 --> 00:54:47,204
If you like the general look
of this place,

800
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:50,910
I could call my friend Mike Holly
at the, uh, Courtney Stables.

801
00:54:50,934 --> 00:54:54,234
It's just in the next county.
He'd love to have you.

802
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:56,830
Oh, well, that would be great.

803
00:54:56,954 --> 00:54:58,430
Thank you.

804
00:54:58,454 --> 00:55:01,354
<i>Listen, if you need anything,
you call me, OK?</i>

805
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,000
I love you.

806
00:55:03,124 --> 00:55:04,600
<i>I love you, too. </i>

807
00:55:04,624 --> 00:55:06,024
Bye-bye.

808
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:14,710
I can't thank you enough, Mike.
It's been an incredible 3 days.

809
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:18,520
Just disappointed I didn't  get a chance
to ride one of your horses.

810
00:55:18,544 --> 00:55:20,744
How would you like to ride
my prize stallion?

811
00:55:20,768 --> 00:55:22,568
Oh, I'd love it.

812
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,170
Tate?

813
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:37,270
Oh, he looked like someone I used to know.
Tate Jordan. He worked on the Lord ranch.

814
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:39,850
Yeah, I knew Tate.
I heard he went up to Wyoming.

815
00:55:39,874 --> 00:55:40,874
Really?

816
00:55:40,898 --> 00:55:43,198
Do you know where in Wyoming?

817
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:45,950
No. But I also heard
he went to Arizona. So...

818
00:55:45,974 --> 00:55:47,474
you know how folks are.

819
00:55:47,498 --> 00:55:50,298
They talk about who's around,
make up stories about who's going.

820
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:52,930
Come on,
let's get you on that horse.

821
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:35,650
Mike, you seen Sam?

822
00:56:35,674 --> 00:56:38,074
No. Not since she
took my horse for a ride.

823
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:43,310
My god, that's her horse.
Something's happened, Mike.

824
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:46,434
Something must be wrong.

825
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:50,970
Wait. I see something.

826
00:56:58,120 --> 00:56:59,350
Sam!

827
00:56:59,874 --> 00:57:01,074
Sam...

828
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:05,400
She's alive.

829
00:57:05,424 --> 00:57:07,424
You stay with her, I'm going
back to the ranch for help.

830
00:57:07,448 --> 00:57:09,396
Just get somebody here
as fast as you can, alright?

831
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:12,470
Send in a helicopter if you have to.
Whatever it takes.

832
00:57:12,494 --> 00:57:13,356
Sam.

833
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:15,080
Sam. You'll be OK.

834
00:57:16,304 --> 00:57:17,504
Sammy?

835
00:57:17,652 --> 00:57:20,152
I'm gonna help you.
Sam. Come on, Sam.

836
00:57:24,230 --> 00:57:26,030
Open that up there.

837
00:57:26,355 --> 00:57:27,755
Hurry up!

838
00:57:27,779 --> 00:57:29,556
Hold that up.

839
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:31,340
I'm sorry...

840
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:40,830
Caroline?

841
00:57:41,154 --> 00:57:43,016
- Charlie?
- Yeah.

842
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:44,680
Thanks for coming.

843
00:57:44,704 --> 00:57:47,204
She's, uh... she's still in surgery.

844
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:01,070
She's in recovery...
it's a very complicated procedure...

845
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:03,170
Caroline, this is, uh, Dr. Field.

846
00:58:03,194 --> 00:58:04,656
How is she?

847
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:06,870
Well, she made it through the surgery.

848
00:58:06,894 --> 00:58:10,494
I was able to stop the internal bleeding
and, uh, remove the bone fragments and

849
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:12,790
now we just have to wait and see.

850
00:58:12,814 --> 00:58:15,114
Well... how long
until we know something?

851
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:18,630
If she makes it through 'til tomorrow,
we'll have much better options.

852
00:58:18,654 --> 00:58:20,454
And if she does then...

853
00:58:20,478 --> 00:58:22,316
she'll be OK.

854
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:24,900
Right now,
she's very lucky to be alive.

855
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:29,550
She has a contusion of the spinal cord
which left her partially paralysed.

856
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:32,950
It's unlikely she'll ever regain
full use of her legs.

857
00:58:32,974 --> 00:58:34,236
Oh...

858
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:36,730
There's a lot
we have to talk about, but

859
00:58:36,754 --> 00:58:39,354
first let's just get her
through the night.

860
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:03,390
<i>That night turned into several more.</i>

861
00:59:03,414 --> 00:59:05,314
<i>I'm not sure how many.</i>

862
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,410
<i>But you remember, Charlie.</i>

863
00:59:07,434 --> 00:59:10,034
<i>You were there
for everyone of them.</i>

864
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:15,870
<i> Now my days are measured
in small increments. </i>

865
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:19,490
<i> How many times I can lift.
Going to the bathroom by myself. </i>

866
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:23,250
<i>Re-learning...
re-thinking my whole life.</i>

867
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:26,590
<i>Oh, they never leave me alone,
you know?</i>

868
00:59:26,614 --> 00:59:29,514
<i>Sometimes I think they're afraid
of what'll happen...</i>

869
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:32,130
<i>if they give me time to think.</i>

870
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:39,570
<i>Caroline, who's as wonderful as always,
tries to keep my spirits up.</i>

871
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:43,510
<i>She says that I have to
reclaim my independence.</i>

872
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:46,590
<i>But I don't know how to do that,
Charlie.</i>

873
00:59:46,614 --> 00:59:50,414
<i>Because what I want is to be
the way I was before the accident.</i>

874
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,290
<i> My body doesn't feel like
it belongs to me anymore.</i>

875
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:57,610
<i>The only time I feel like myself, is</i>

876
00:59:57,634 --> 00:59:59,496
<i>when I dream.</i>

877
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:03,110
<i>Because when I'm dreaming,
I'm not being poked and prodded, and...</i>

878
01:00:03,134 --> 01:00:06,534
<i>and I'm not surrounded
by well-meaning strangers.</i>

879
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:09,830
<i> And I'm not in a wheelchair.</i>

880
01:00:24,605 --> 01:00:26,105
Watch your hip.

881
01:00:26,455 --> 01:00:29,155
Use your weight to
bring your legs forward. Come on.

882
01:00:29,579 --> 01:00:30,656
That's it.

883
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:32,130
Try to lift forward.

884
01:00:32,154 --> 01:00:33,816
Good. Come on.

885
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:35,490
Let's try it again.

886
01:00:35,514 --> 01:00:37,314
I don't want to.

887
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:41,610
I know just how you feel.

888
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:49,190
It's, uh, pretty impressive hardware
you got there, though.

889
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,370
It makes me look like Shredder.

890
01:00:53,394 --> 01:00:56,394
You know he is? The Ninja Turtle bad guy?

891
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:59,110
He wore stuff on his legs, too.

892
01:00:59,334 --> 01:01:01,334
Oh, I see.

893
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:05,030
Well, uh, what's your name?

894
01:01:05,254 --> 01:01:07,454
I can't call you Shredder.

895
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,500
Timmy.

896
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:14,190
Let's try it again, Timmy.

897
01:01:14,915 --> 01:01:16,115
OK?

898
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:19,650
OK.

899
01:01:19,674 --> 01:01:20,874
Come on.

900
01:01:22,622 --> 01:01:23,822
Come on.

901
01:01:24,195 --> 01:01:25,395
Come on.

902
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:26,990
Tuck your hip.

903
01:01:27,914 --> 01:01:29,014
Good.

904
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,570
Now move your weight. There you go.

905
01:01:31,694 --> 01:01:32,894
And again.

906
01:01:32,918 --> 01:01:33,956
Good.

907
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:37,470
Thank you, Sam. No one's ever
bought me colouring books before.

908
01:01:37,594 --> 01:01:39,194
Oh, you're welcome.

909
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:41,570
Does anyone ever
come see you here?

910
01:01:41,594 --> 01:01:43,656
Yes. My friend Caroline,
she comes once a week.

911
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:46,700
And my best friend he would come
but he lives in New York.

912
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:50,790
My mother would see me too,
but she can't...

913
01:01:50,814 --> 01:01:52,414
she's in jail.

914
01:01:52,438 --> 01:01:53,276
Oh.

915
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:55,350
She got 30 days.

916
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:01,580
OK, ready?

917
01:02:01,604 --> 01:02:03,481
Here we go. Up.

918
01:02:03,505 --> 01:02:05,115
Good, hold it.

919
01:02:05,140 --> 01:02:06,770
Lock this in.

920
01:02:10,694 --> 01:02:12,194
Alright, go.

921
01:02:12,218 --> 01:02:13,318
Good.

922
01:02:13,842 --> 01:02:14,942
OK.

923
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:20,810
Place your hips.

924
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:26,910
Not like that.

925
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:33,450
That's it!

926
01:02:35,298 --> 01:02:36,698
That's it.

927
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,010
Alright, bring the chair.

928
01:02:42,034 --> 01:02:44,634
- Good, good. Got it? Got it?
- Yeah.

929
01:02:44,958 --> 01:02:46,558
- Right?
- Yeah.

930
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:49,990
Down we go.

931
01:02:50,014 --> 01:02:51,414
Got it?

932
01:02:52,438 --> 01:02:53,638
Good.

933
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:56,240
Good work.

934
01:02:57,164 --> 01:02:59,764
OK, just tell me it's gonna to get easier.

935
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:06,610
But it's not, is it?

936
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:13,710
Sam?

937
01:03:14,134 --> 01:03:15,634
<i>Caroline?</i>

938
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,670
What am I gonna do?

939
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:22,730
My god, Sam, it's over.

940
01:03:23,054 --> 01:03:25,654
Bill died last night.

941
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:30,570
I'm so sorry.

942
01:03:32,094 --> 01:03:34,494
Is there anything I can do?

943
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:37,510
There's nothing anyone can do.

944
01:03:37,934 --> 01:03:41,334
All my family gone
and now Bill. I...

945
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:44,770
I just feel like there's no one left,
and there's nothing to care about.

946
01:03:44,794 --> 01:03:47,794
<i>No, that's not true,
you still have the ranch.</i>

947
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,150
And me.

948
01:03:50,336 --> 01:03:53,036
And lots of people
who care about you.

949
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:55,890
<i>Try to remember that. </i>

950
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,010
You're too young, Sam. It's...

951
01:03:59,034 --> 01:04:01,834
too hard for you to understand.

952
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:03,670
<i> But thank you.</i>

953
01:04:03,694 --> 01:04:05,694
<i>Goodbye, Sam.</i>

954
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:15,050
Please don't cry.

955
01:04:15,174 --> 01:04:18,174
Sometimes my mum just
cries and cries and cries.

956
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:20,230
Then I hold her.

957
01:04:33,875 --> 01:04:35,075
Sam.

958
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,070
Thank you for coming.

959
01:04:39,494 --> 01:04:40,894
Thank you.

960
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:48,780
The day I took this, was one of
the last times I was on a horse.

961
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:52,760
I don't know if I'll ever ride again.

962
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:55,610
You also said you'd
never fall in love again.

963
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:01,230
Bill was so straight in the saddle.

964
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:05,050
I could pick him out
of 20 men at 2 miles.

965
01:05:08,060 --> 01:05:11,210
Well, I think I'll just put this aside,
I can't concentrate.

966
01:05:11,234 --> 01:05:13,834
Why don't we just go outside.
It'll do us both some good.

967
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:15,990
Oh, you go on...

968
01:05:16,414 --> 01:05:19,214
What about Josh?
I know he needs talk to you.

969
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:21,630
Maybe tomorrow.

970
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:26,530
The ranch just doesn't
mean anything without Bill here.

971
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:34,290
I'm sorry, Sam, it's how I feel.

972
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,790
A lot of people have relationships,

973
01:05:38,814 --> 01:05:40,514
get married.

974
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:46,230
I don't know many who could honestly say
they had a love affair for over 20 years.

975
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:48,710
We did have that.

976
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:52,470
You're so sweet to come, Sam, but...

977
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:55,750
what I need now is time alone.

978
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:07,590
- Thanks, Josh. I'll be OK from here.
- You sure?

979
01:06:07,614 --> 01:06:09,414
Yeah, it's fine. Thanks again.

980
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:11,970
- You're welcome. Call if you
need anything.  - I will.

981
01:06:11,994 --> 01:06:13,394
- Bye-bye.
- Bye

982
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:25,830
Hi, Timmy.

983
01:06:26,154 --> 01:06:28,154
Where are you goin'?

984
01:06:28,340 --> 01:06:29,950
I'm leaving.

985
01:06:29,974 --> 01:06:32,274
Timmy's mother
was released yesterday.

986
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:37,830
Well, I stopped back on the
way from the ranch and, uh,

987
01:06:37,854 --> 01:06:39,854
bought you something.

988
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:42,570
Wow, Ninja Turtles!

989
01:06:42,694 --> 01:06:45,294
There's a little spending money inside.

990
01:06:46,795 --> 01:06:48,295
Listen, I, um...

991
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:51,790
I'm gonna give you my friend Charlie's
phone number. OK?

992
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:55,650
I'm gonna be going home
in a few weeks too, and...

993
01:06:55,674 --> 01:06:58,174
Charlie always knows
where to find me.

994
01:06:58,975 --> 01:07:00,175
So...

995
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,070
if you need me... for anything...

996
01:07:04,094 --> 01:07:05,494
anything...

997
01:07:05,518 --> 01:07:07,918
- you just call, OK?
- OK.

998
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,510
I have something for you too.

999
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:17,990
I made it all by myself.

1000
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:26,270
Is this me?

1001
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:28,730
This is you?

1002
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:34,050
This is the way I, uh...
see myself when I'm dreaming.

1003
01:07:34,174 --> 01:07:35,574
It is?

1004
01:07:35,598 --> 01:07:36,998
Yeah.

1005
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:40,310
How did you know that?

1006
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:43,870
Sam...

1007
01:07:43,894 --> 01:07:44,970
Yeah.

1008
01:07:44,994 --> 01:07:47,094
will you dream about me?

1009
01:07:49,180 --> 01:07:51,050
Every night.

1010
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:56,270
I'm gonna miss you,
so much.

1011
01:07:56,294 --> 01:07:58,694
We have to leave now, Timmy.

1012
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:02,800
Goodbye, Sam.

1013
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:10,850
Take care of yourself, OK?

1014
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:18,790
I love you, Sam.

1015
01:08:19,214 --> 01:08:21,214
I love you too.

1016
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:29,170
<font color="#ffff80">A FEW MONTHS LATER</font>

1017
01:08:44,156 --> 01:08:45,356
Samantha Taylor.

1018
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:46,756
Sam, it's Josh.

1019
01:08:46,780 --> 01:08:50,280
I hope you don't mind me calling
but I thought you'd want to know.

1020
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:53,130
What is it, Josh, what?
What's the matter?

1021
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:56,110
Miss Caroline's real sick.

1022
01:08:56,434 --> 01:08:57,934
Oh, no.

1023
01:09:00,540 --> 01:09:03,770
Bill loved to sit out here
in the late afternoon.

1024
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:06,410
Are you sure you're strong enough?

1025
01:09:06,434 --> 01:09:09,234
Maybe it was a stupid idea
to have Josh carry you out.

1026
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:11,970
No, I want to see all this again.

1027
01:09:11,994 --> 01:09:15,094
I can't see so that much
from my bedroom window.

1028
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:20,630
We don't have to
tell each other goodbye.

1029
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:24,110
Or how much
we meant to each other.

1030
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:28,110
I love you, Caroline.

1031
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:33,520
You've been like a daughter to me.

1032
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:40,210
And I want you to have the ranch,
after I die.

1033
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:45,930
But I don't want you to think of it...

1034
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:52,410
as an obligation, it's a gift.
You don't have to keep it.

1035
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:56,690
This ranch has given me
great pleasure.

1036
01:09:58,100 --> 01:10:01,450
But I don't want it preserved
as some sort of

1037
01:10:01,474 --> 01:10:03,874
homage to the past.

1038
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:07,530
Promise me, Sam.

1039
01:10:10,154 --> 01:10:11,854
I promise.

1040
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:27,050
I can't believe she's gone.

1041
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:31,010
I'm real sorry.
Losing Miss Caroline must be like...

1042
01:10:31,034 --> 01:10:33,196
like losing your own mother.

1043
01:10:33,620 --> 01:10:35,690
No, it's different.

1044
01:10:36,314 --> 01:10:38,714
Caroline and I never fought.

1045
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:46,130
Have you decided what you're gonna do
with the place? Are you gonna sell it?

1046
01:10:46,154 --> 01:10:47,516
I don't know.

1047
01:10:47,540 --> 01:10:50,370
It doesn't really
seem important anymore.

1048
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:54,710
'Cause what I really want,

1049
01:10:55,334 --> 01:10:57,134
I can't have.

1050
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:01,210
Come on, there's something
I think you should see.

1051
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:09,810
Keep 'em shut.

1052
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:12,170
OK.

1053
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:18,720
Caroline had me make it up for you.
She believed you'd want to ride again.

1054
01:11:19,775 --> 01:11:21,175
Well...

1055
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:23,290
let's give it a try.

1056
01:11:23,314 --> 01:11:25,176
Saddle him up.

1057
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:27,830
Now hold on. Are you sure you
want to start with that horse?

1058
01:11:27,854 --> 01:11:29,416
He ain't been ridden for a while.

1059
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:31,470
I don't want another horse.

1060
01:11:31,494 --> 01:11:32,870
I know this horse.

1061
01:11:32,894 --> 01:11:35,894
Isn't that right buddy?
We're old friends, aren't we?

1062
01:11:35,918 --> 01:11:37,118
Yeah.

1063
01:11:37,842 --> 01:11:39,042
OK.

1064
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:46,980
Are you OK?

1065
01:11:47,004 --> 01:11:48,804
I hate to admit it...

1066
01:11:48,828 --> 01:11:50,456
even to you.

1067
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:52,150
I'm a little afraid.

1068
01:11:52,174 --> 01:11:54,174
Let me take the reins.

1069
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:57,620
Here we go. Nice and easy, boy.
Come on.

1070
01:11:57,720 --> 01:11:59,550
Nice and easy.

1071
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:04,670
How are you doin'?

1072
01:12:04,894 --> 01:12:06,656
I feel like a baby.

1073
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:09,730
Oh, you gotta learn to walk
before you can trot.

1074
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:16,180
- You OK?
- Yeah.

1075
01:12:24,020 --> 01:12:26,350
Alright, let me have 'em.

1076
01:12:27,374 --> 01:12:29,174
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1077
01:12:29,260 --> 01:12:31,710
Don't worry,
I'll be right over here.

1078
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:35,030
OK, buddy.

1079
01:12:38,595 --> 01:12:40,195
That's it.

1080
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:43,210
Easy does it.

1081
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:46,450
Nice boy.

1082
01:12:48,495 --> 01:12:49,695
Faster?

1083
01:12:50,020 --> 01:12:51,710
Faster, huh?

1084
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:54,150
Yeah, let it loose a little bit.

1085
01:12:54,174 --> 01:12:56,574
You're doing good. You look great.

1086
01:12:57,240 --> 01:12:59,270
Good. Good.

1087
01:13:03,395 --> 01:13:04,995
Good! Good!

1088
01:13:06,095 --> 01:13:08,295
Come on boy, come on.

1089
01:13:09,819 --> 01:13:11,219
That's it.

1090
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:15,590
Hey, look at me Josh, I'm runnin'.

1091
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:20,930
You know, until now...

1092
01:13:21,554 --> 01:13:24,954
I didn't know what I wanted
to do with this ranch but...

1093
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:27,370
I think I just figured it out.

1094
01:13:27,494 --> 01:13:29,594
I may be out of my mind but

1095
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:32,150
can't you see this place
full of children?

1096
01:13:32,174 --> 01:13:33,636
Children?

1097
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:35,990
Yeah. What I want to do...

1098
01:13:36,014 --> 01:13:38,414
is turn this ranch into a camp.

1099
01:13:38,538 --> 01:13:41,738
For kids.
Kids with special needs, like me.

1100
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:44,400
Josh, you can teach anybody
how to ride.

1101
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:47,990
Would you stay on? Be my foreman?

1102
01:13:48,014 --> 01:13:50,314
Yes, ma'am, I'd like that.

1103
01:13:52,100 --> 01:13:54,370
I've come home, Josh.

1104
01:13:55,380 --> 01:13:57,130
Now I know.

1105
01:13:57,454 --> 01:13:59,554
This is where I belong.

1106
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:09,480
<i>Dear Charlie,</i>

1107
01:14:09,504 --> 01:14:13,104
<i>although the Caroline Lord Ranch
For Children has only been open
for a few months,</i>

1108
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:16,650
<i> I have twice as many applicants
as I have places available.</i>

1109
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:21,450
<i>So I've sold off another 5,000 ares to
pay for renovations and 2 more buildings.</i>

1110
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:25,030
<i> By next summer I hope we
won't have to turn anyone away.</i>

1111
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:27,470
<i> I feel confident on horseback now.</i>

1112
01:14:27,494 --> 01:14:29,184
<i>I still use the leg straps</i>

1113
01:14:29,208 --> 01:14:33,408
<i>but the first saddle Josh made for me is now
one of a dozen we use to teach the kids.</i>

1114
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:37,770
<i>I can remember a time when
only perfection seemed normal.</i>

1115
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:40,550
<i>A time when I wouldn't have known
how to handle any of the problems</i>

1116
01:14:40,574 --> 01:14:42,674
<i>that are now part of an ordinary day:</i>

1117
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:44,630
<i>Children who won't cooperate.</i>

1118
01:14:44,654 --> 01:14:46,654
<i>Artificial limbs that don't fit.</i>

1119
01:14:46,678 --> 01:14:49,816
<i>Wheelchairs that get stuck
and braces that break.</i>

1120
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:53,580
<i>The mechanics of it all
strike me as extraordinary. But...</i>

1121
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:55,990
<i>most extraordinary of all of it</i>

1122
01:14:56,014 --> 01:14:58,414
<i>is that it's become
a way of life.</i>

1123
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:02,230
<i>As long as I can remember, Charlie,
I've longed for children.</i>

1124
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:04,940
<i>And now I never have less than 20.</i>

1125
01:15:04,964 --> 01:15:06,764
<i>Come see me soon.</i>

1126
01:15:06,888 --> 01:15:08,688
<i>Love, Sam.</i>

1127
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:13,110
We have to find a place for you
to stay for a while.

1128
01:15:13,134 --> 01:15:15,934
Do you have a grandmother?
Or an aunt?

1129
01:15:15,958 --> 01:15:17,096
No.

1130
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:18,930
How about your dad?

1131
01:15:18,954 --> 01:15:21,154
Is there somebody
we could call?

1132
01:15:21,178 --> 01:15:22,216
OK.

1133
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:26,090
Look, maybe I can find a foster home
for you to stay in tonight.

1134
01:15:26,114 --> 01:15:28,114
We'll see what we can do.

1135
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:30,070
And there's not just the cou...

1136
01:15:30,094 --> 01:15:31,294
Wait!

1137
01:15:31,318 --> 01:15:32,918
I got this.

1138
01:15:34,442 --> 01:15:35,642
OK.

1139
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:40,030
Now that phase one is totally complete,
that we move back to the...

1140
01:15:40,254 --> 01:15:42,454
thank you -
north pasture,

1141
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:44,790
- making them access...
- Sam!

1142
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:51,730
Hey...

1143
01:15:52,054 --> 01:15:54,054
Hey, Timmy...

1144
01:15:57,135 --> 01:15:58,535
Oh...

1145
01:15:59,459 --> 01:16:00,959
look at you...

1146
01:16:01,260 --> 01:16:02,870
come here.

1147
01:16:02,894 --> 01:16:04,694
You come here.

1148
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:09,450
I missed you.

1149
01:16:12,874 --> 01:16:14,374
There you go.

1150
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:25,470
OK, Timmy, you hang on now.

1151
01:16:25,494 --> 01:16:27,494
- OK.
- Hang on tight right there.

1152
01:16:27,518 --> 01:16:29,336
Just hold on tight.

1153
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:32,230
OK. How you doin'? You feel OK?

1154
01:16:34,380 --> 01:16:36,850
- You want to go faster?
- Yeah.

1155
01:16:36,974 --> 01:16:39,836
- Oh, will you look at him, Josh.
- Sure ain't afraid, is he?

1156
01:16:39,914 --> 01:16:42,314
Oh, no. He's a natural
on a horse, huh?

1157
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:45,190
In a month he's
gonna be ridin' home.

How long is he gonna be with us?

As long as he wants to.

1165
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:14,150
His mother died of a
drug overdose, and, uh,

1166
01:17:14,236 --> 01:17:17,236
none of the relatives were willing
or able to take him in.

1167
01:17:17,260 --> 01:17:19,790
Sounds like a hard life
for a little kid.

But I say now that
he's got you in his corner,

1169
01:17:22,864 --> 01:17:25,064
his life's gonna be changing.

You two guys, uh,
go on up ahead,

1174
01:17:42,934 --> 01:17:45,334
I've got to go back to the ranch,
I have some work to do.

were gonna meet me at the stable.

1178
01:18:53,034 --> 01:18:55,296
- We took a little extra ride.
- Josh.

1179
01:18:55,474 --> 01:18:58,074
Well, I'll be doggoned.
Good to see you, Tate.

1180
01:18:58,098 --> 01:18:59,736
What brings you this way?

1181
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:02,450
I was up in Santa Barbara
for the Vacaro show

1182
01:19:02,474 --> 01:19:04,674
when I heard about Bill and Caroline.

1183
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:06,830
They're gonna be missed.

1184
01:19:06,954 --> 01:19:08,154
Yep.

1185
01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:11,890
Are you two ready to call it a day?

1186
01:19:11,914 --> 01:19:13,536
- Yes.
- Yeah.

1187
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:16,030
Let me give you a hand.

1188
01:19:16,454 --> 01:19:19,054
You have to unstrap my legs first.

1189
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:24,390
What's going on here, Josh?

1190
01:19:24,414 --> 01:19:27,214
Why, things have changed
since you went away, Tate.

1191
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:32,170
What's he doing here?

1192
01:19:32,194 --> 01:19:34,894
He came by to pay his respects.
He wants to see you.

1193
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:37,350
- Did you tell him what happened to me?
- No.

1194
01:19:37,374 --> 01:19:39,474
We just talked about
the ranch, that's all.

1195
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:41,650
Go outside and-and
tell him I'm gone

1196
01:19:41,774 --> 01:19:44,074
and-and you don't know
when I'll be back.

1197
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:46,830
Go on, Josh, just do it.

1198
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:50,000
You know, this isn't like you.

1199
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:54,830
Don't you think at the very least you
owe him a couple of minutes of your time?

1200
01:19:54,854 --> 01:19:57,054
I don't owe him anything!

1201
01:19:57,240 --> 01:19:59,090
He left me!

1202
01:19:59,314 --> 01:20:02,114
Well then,
maybe you owe it to yourself.

1203
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:07,750
Go outside and give him a horse,

1204
01:20:07,774 --> 01:20:10,274
so he can ride over to the graves
to pay his respects.

1205
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:12,440
And tell him I'm...

1206
01:20:12,464 --> 01:20:14,664
I'll be gone until tomorrow.

1207
01:20:16,075 --> 01:20:17,275
OK.

1208
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:20,730
But if you should change your mind...

1209
01:20:20,754 --> 01:20:22,354
Just do it, Josh!

1210
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:27,000
Please?

1211
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:10,640
Hey, Timmy.

1212
01:22:10,664 --> 01:22:14,040
You were kinda quiet at dinner tonight.
Anything bothering you?

1213
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:16,810
Heather's leaving on Wednesday.

1214
01:22:17,134 --> 01:22:19,534
- She told me so.
- Oh...

1215
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:23,740
Yeah, it's always sad when
somebody has to leave us.

1216
01:22:23,864 --> 01:22:25,864
I know you'll miss her.

1217
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:29,360
When will I have to leave?

1218
01:22:29,755 --> 01:22:31,155
Timmy...

1219
01:22:31,380 --> 01:22:34,130
you never have to leave.
This is your home.

1220
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:39,010
But... what if that social worker
comes and takes me away?

1221
01:22:39,734 --> 01:22:41,134
Uh...

1222
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,890
What if we made it so that
no one could ever do that?

1223
01:22:45,914 --> 01:22:47,114
How?

1224
01:22:48,238 --> 01:22:49,638
Well...

1225
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:53,190
if I adopted you...

1226
01:22:53,214 --> 01:22:55,714
then we'd belong
with each other.

1227
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:58,850
Does that mean I can
stay here at the ranch forever?

1228
01:22:58,874 --> 01:23:00,136
Yeah.

1229
01:23:00,160 --> 01:23:01,210
Sam.

1230
01:23:01,234 --> 01:23:02,310
What?

1231
01:23:02,334 --> 01:23:04,534
I want to belong with you.

1232
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:08,710
Oh... I want to belong with you, too.

1233
01:23:10,015 --> 01:23:11,415
Mm.

1234
01:23:11,740 --> 01:23:13,590
Oh, a big hug.

1235
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:19,770
- Good morning, Josh.
- Good morning, Sam.

1236
01:23:19,794 --> 01:23:21,594
- Beautiful morning, isn't it?
- Yeah.

1237
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:25,330
- Would you mind keeping an eye on Timmy
for me for a couple of hours? - No problem.

1238
01:23:25,354 --> 01:23:27,516
I'm gonna take ride
out to the cabin.

1239
01:23:27,574 --> 01:23:31,574
Sooner or later I'll have to go out there and
go through it and pack things away but...

1240
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:35,010
kind of want to see it one last time,
the way it was.

1241
01:23:38,058 --> 01:23:39,258
Thanks.

1242
01:23:39,682 --> 01:23:40,882
Come on.

1243
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:18,020
Hello, Tate.

1244
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:22,160
Josh told me you come out here.

1245
01:24:22,184 --> 01:24:24,784
I had to see you
before I took off for Montana.

1246
01:24:24,808 --> 01:24:27,288
Yeah, well, I uh...
I have to get back to the ranch

1247
01:24:27,312 --> 01:24:29,156
because I've been gone
too long already. Come on.

1248
01:24:29,180 --> 01:24:30,770
Sam, wait.

1249
01:24:35,240 --> 01:24:37,910
It's quite a place
you put together here.

1250
01:24:38,134 --> 01:24:39,996
What made you do it?

1251
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:42,790
I never figured that
you'd leave New York.

1252
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:45,890
I came back after Caroline died.

1253
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:48,370
I still miss her.

1254
01:24:48,456 --> 01:24:50,956
Look, do you wanna get down
and talk a minute?

1255
01:24:50,980 --> 01:24:52,230
No.

1256
01:24:52,940 --> 01:24:56,020
I don't mean go into the cabin.
I wouldn't do that.

1257
01:24:57,240 --> 01:24:59,600
There's a lot I never said, Sam.

1258
01:24:59,724 --> 01:25:01,824
You don't have to say anything.

1259
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:04,070
It doesn't matter anymore.

1260
01:25:04,094 --> 01:25:05,956
Maybe not to you.

1261
01:25:06,180 --> 01:25:08,050
But it does to me.

1262
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:12,190
I want you to know one thing, Sam.

1263
01:25:12,314 --> 01:25:14,114
I was wrong.

1264
01:25:16,020 --> 01:25:18,050
What do you mean?

1265
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:22,190
It was the biggest mistake of my life,
when I walked out on you.

1266
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:26,870
I even had a falling out
with my son about it.

1267
01:25:26,980 --> 01:25:30,210
He said I always run away
from the important things,

1268
01:25:30,234 --> 01:25:32,096
the things that mattered.

1269
01:25:32,120 --> 01:25:34,250
I helped him buy
a little place in Montana

1270
01:25:34,274 --> 01:25:36,474
and stayed on to help him
get it goin' but...

1271
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:39,250
to prove to him
he was wrong about me.

1272
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:45,020
What I learned is that it doesn't
mean a damn if you are a rancher,

1273
01:25:45,044 --> 01:25:47,744
or a ranch hand
or a man or a woman.

1274
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:49,820
If you live right,

1275
01:25:49,844 --> 01:25:53,444
and you love well and do good,
that's all that matters.

1276
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:56,730
It's about the longest speech
I've ever made.

1277
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:02,850
You know, you never were one
to bore me with conversation.

1278
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:08,910
Do you remember the first time
we came out here?

1279
01:26:08,934 --> 01:26:11,564
Yeah. It was a long time ago.

1280
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:16,980
- Come on, let's go for a walk.
- No, I have to get back...

1281
01:26:17,004 --> 01:26:19,494
If I don't do this now, I may
never get another chance...

1282
01:26:19,518 --> 01:26:20,976
- I told you I have to go now.
- Why?

1283
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,010
- Because I have to.
- Look, why don't you just...

1284
01:26:23,034 --> 01:26:25,034
- Because it's too late.
- Sam, wait!

1285
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:52,790
You're like the little girl
in the wheelchair, aren't you?

1286
01:26:52,814 --> 01:26:55,014
The one you taught to ride.

1287
01:26:57,440 --> 01:26:59,510
Sam, why didn't you tell me?

1288
01:26:59,534 --> 01:27:01,634
I don't want your pity.

1289
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:03,210
I was wrong

1290
01:27:03,234 --> 01:27:06,634
to think that my being a ranch hand
would make a difference to you.

1291
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:08,350
And you were wrong
if you think that

1292
01:27:08,374 --> 01:27:10,974
not being able to walk is
gonna make a difference to me.

1293
01:27:10,998 --> 01:27:12,136
No.

1294
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:14,830
There are some things
that do make a difference.

1295
01:27:14,854 --> 01:27:16,654
Not to me.

1296
01:27:18,020 --> 01:27:19,830
Tell me how it happened.

1297
01:27:22,860 --> 01:27:24,570
It happened.

1298
01:27:25,694 --> 01:27:27,094
OK?

1299
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:29,250
I can live with it.

1300
01:27:29,774 --> 01:27:32,474
But I can't force it on someone else.

1301
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:34,310
Is there someone else?

1302
01:27:34,334 --> 01:27:37,834
- I mean if there is, I'll go away.
- No, there's no one else!

1303
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:41,990
I don't want

1304
01:27:42,014 --> 01:27:46,014
or expect anything more
than what I have right now.

1305
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:51,690
I belong...

1306
01:27:52,014 --> 01:27:54,214
on this ranch.

1307
01:27:54,738 --> 01:27:56,038
I feel...

1308
01:27:56,176 --> 01:27:57,976
like a part of this land...

1309
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,070
and the kids, and...

1310
01:28:00,094 --> 01:28:02,694
and I have one little boy
that I'm going to adopt. I...

1311
01:28:02,780 --> 01:28:04,560
What about love?

1312
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:08,370
What about it?

1313
01:28:08,394 --> 01:28:11,594
I remember once when you
wouldn't let me give up on it.

1314
01:28:11,780 --> 01:28:13,850
Things were different then.

1315
01:28:13,874 --> 01:28:15,974
They don't have to be.

1316
01:28:18,520 --> 01:28:20,790
Sam, you talk about...

1317
01:28:21,114 --> 01:28:23,514
bein' a part of this land.

1318
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:27,690
I'll tell you something,

1319
01:28:27,714 --> 01:28:31,714
my whole life I've knocked around
from one ranch to another.

1320
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:36,480
The only time I ever felt like
I really belonged somewhere

1321
01:28:36,504 --> 01:28:38,504
was when I was with you.

1322
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:02,470
I'll always love you, Sam.

1323
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:08,210
I love you, too.

1324
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:13,750
Welcome home.

1325
01:29:52,466 --> 01:29:55,766
<font color="#ffff80">Thank you for being with us tonight,
for Palomino.</font>

1326
01:29:55,790 --> 01:29:58,690
<font color="#ffff80">I hope to see you again soon
for our next movie.</font>

1327
01:29:58,714 --> 01:30:00,314
<font color="#ffff80">Good night.</font>
