00:00:35,503 --> 00:00:38,654
Hey! Whoa! Yo!
False alarm! Hold it!

2
00:00:38,743 --> 00:00:42,053
It's OK! I'm here.
Here we are! It's all right.

3
00:00:42,143 --> 00:00:45,294
- Set it down nice and easy, huh?
- Sure, at the impound.

4
00:00:45,383 --> 00:00:47,772
- Next time, read the sign.
- You don't understand.

5
00:00:47,863 --> 00:00:51,139
I'm here to meet my wife's plane.
Let me have this car.

6
00:00:51,223 --> 00:00:54,056
Sure. Tomorrow, 8.00 to 4.00.
Pay $40, we give it back.

7
00:00:54,143 --> 00:00:55,337
Don't write it up!

8
00:00:55,423 --> 00:00:57,334
Come on, this is my mother-in-law's car.

9
00:00:57,423 --> 00:01:00,256
She's already mad at me
cos I'm not a dentist.

10
00:01:00,343 --> 00:01:02,254
Look, I'm a cop. LAPD.

11
00:01:02,343 --> 00:01:05,062
Oh, I was in LA once. Hated it.

12
00:01:05,143 --> 00:01:07,259
I can understand.
I don't like it much... Hey!

13
00:01:07,343 --> 00:01:09,732
That's a plastic fender up there!
Take it easy!

14
00:01:09,823 --> 00:01:11,814
Cut me some slack, will you?

15
00:01:11,903 --> 00:01:13,336
I was a cop in New York City.

16
00:01:13,423 --> 00:01:15,937
I only moved to LA
because my wife took a job there.

17
00:01:16,023 --> 00:01:17,138
What do you say?

18
00:01:17,223 --> 00:01:20,454
Here we are, Washington, DC,
the heart of democracy.

19
00:01:20,543 --> 00:01:22,215
One hand washes the other.

20
00:01:22,303 --> 00:01:23,861
Come on, man. It's Christmas.

21
00:01:23,943 --> 00:01:26,332
So ask Santa Claus
to give you another car.

22
00:01:26,423 --> 00:01:28,414
Merry Christmas, pal.

23
00:01:29,703 --> 00:01:31,534
It's all yours, Murray.

24
00:01:34,463 --> 00:01:36,419
Son of a bitch.

00:02:10,863 --> 00:02:12,854
Yeah, I know that, Larry.

Hi. Where are the telephones?

30
00:02:18,103 --> 00:02:20,094
- Over there.
- Thank you very much.

31
00:02:20,183 --> 00:02:22,378
(TV) LeonardAdkins is in a warmer clime...

32
00:02:22,463 --> 00:02:24,579
..with a story that grows
hotter by the minute.

33
00:02:24,663 --> 00:02:28,372
Security was tight today
at Escalan airport in Valverde,...

34
00:02:28,463 --> 00:02:30,499
..where government authorities report...

35
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,460
..that deposed general Ramon Esperanza...

36
00:02:32,543 --> 00:02:35,341
..will be delivered
for extradition to the United States.

37
00:02:35,423 --> 00:02:37,379
Only two years ago,
General Esperanza...

38
00:02:37,463 --> 00:02:41,536
..led his country's army in a campaign
against communist insurgents,...

39
00:02:41,623 --> 00:02:44,456
..a campaign fought with
American money and advisers.

40
00:02:44,543 --> 00:02:46,340
Esperanza's fall from power
caused ripples...

41
00:02:46,423 --> 00:02:51,053
..in his country's recent election,
and closer to home as well,...

42
00:02:51,143 --> 00:02:53,532
..when high-ranking
Pentagon offiicials were charged...

43
00:02:53,623 --> 00:02:56,183
..with supplying him with weapons
despite the Congressional ban.

44
00:02:56,263 --> 00:02:57,981
Evidence that Esperanza's forces...

45
00:02:58,063 --> 00:03:00,861
..violated the neutrality
of neighbouring countries...

46
00:03:00,943 --> 00:03:03,013
..made Congress withhold funds.

47
00:03:03,103 --> 00:03:06,539
Esperanza is accused
of replacing the funds...

48
00:03:06,623 --> 00:03:08,102
- ..by cocaine smuggling.
- (beeping)

49
00:03:08,183 --> 00:03:11,778
Although Esperanza was removed
as commander in chiefthis year,...

50
00:03:11,863 --> 00:03:15,139
..the agreement to extradite him
was only reachedyesterday.

51
00:03:15,223 --> 00:03:18,977
Washington insiders say
a phone call made it happen,...

52
00:03:19,063 --> 00:03:20,416
..a phone call from a...

53
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:24,736

54
00:03:24,823 --> 00:03:27,212
All right, all right.

55
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:33,371
If I could find a phone,
I'd call you, whoever you are.

56
00:04:03,223 --> 00:04:04,497
Bye.

57
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,380
Excuse me. Thank you.

58
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:17,341
This is LieutenantMcClane.
Somebody there beep me?

59
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,459
- I'd like to think I'm somebody.
- Honey!

60
00:04:19,543 --> 00:04:22,103
Where are you? Did you land yet?

61
00:04:22,183 --> 00:04:24,617
It's the nineties, remember?

62
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:27,979
Microchips, microwaves, faxes, air phones.

63
00:04:28,063 --> 00:04:32,739
As far as I'm concerned,
progress peaked with frozen pizza.

64
00:04:32,823 --> 00:04:36,702
Listen, um, we're going to be
about half an hour late landing, OK?

65
00:04:36,783 --> 00:04:39,343
I just wanted to let you know.
The kids OK?

66
00:04:39,423 --> 00:04:43,098
They'll lose their minds
from all the sugar your parents give them.

67
00:04:43,183 --> 00:04:46,812
Did Mom give you a hard time
about borrowing her new car?

68
00:04:46,903 --> 00:04:48,256
No. Notyet.

69
00:04:48,343 --> 00:04:52,177
Listen, honey, when you land,
can we just, like, you know,...

70
00:04:52,263 --> 00:04:56,051
..rent a car, check into a hotel,
leave the kids with your parents?

71
00:04:56,143 --> 00:04:58,532
Order some room service?

72
00:04:58,623 --> 00:05:00,932
A bottle ofchampagne,
what do you say?

73
00:05:01,023 --> 00:05:02,934
You're on, Lieutenant.

74
00:05:03,023 --> 00:05:05,491
I'll see you in about
half an hour, honey.

75
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:06,902
I love you. Bye.

76
00:05:11,223 --> 00:05:13,612
Isn't technology wonderful?

77
00:05:14,263 --> 00:05:16,254
My husband doesn't think so.

78
00:05:16,343 --> 00:05:17,981
Well, I do.

79
00:05:18,703 --> 00:05:21,297
I used to carry around
those awful Mace things.

80
00:05:21,383 --> 00:05:22,896
Now...

81
00:05:25,303 --> 00:05:28,375
I zap any bastard that screws with me.

82
00:05:30,983 --> 00:05:33,816
I tried it on my little dog.

83
00:05:33,903 --> 00:05:36,212
Poor thing limped for a week.

84
00:05:43,703 --> 00:05:44,818
Excuse me.

85
00:05:46,023 --> 00:05:48,617
Well, you look really familiar to me.

86
00:05:48,703 --> 00:05:51,536
I get that a lot. I've been on TV.

87
00:05:51,623 --> 00:05:53,295
Yeah. Me, too.

88
00:06:16,503 --> 00:06:19,063

- You got it.

00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:26,811
..has just arrived under heavy guard.

92
00:06:26,903 --> 00:06:29,542
The deposed dictator's mood
seems jubilant.

93
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:31,853
- He is waving to the crowd,...
- (knocking)

94
00:06:31,943 --> 00:06:34,093

There's no doubt he still has...

97
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:45,015
..some ardent supporters
both here and abroad.

98
00:06:45,103 --> 00:06:47,822
Rumours abound on Capitol Hill
that there were...

99
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:53,501
- Yeah?
- Sir, we're checking our equipment.

100
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:55,938
Any problems with the conduit line?

101
00:06:56,023 --> 00:06:57,820
I don't know anything about that.

102
00:06:57,903 --> 00:07:01,657
- Would you mind if we take a look?
- Help yourself.

103
00:07:11,783 --> 00:07:15,014
It don't seem right somehow,
closing down this church.

104
00:07:15,103 --> 00:07:18,812
The parish is going to keep on using it,
but it won't be the same.

105
00:07:18,903 --> 00:07:22,339
Been here a lot of years,
and I've been right here with it.

106
00:07:22,423 --> 00:07:24,061
Yeah, I kind of feel like...

107
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:26,293
..a piece of me is dying
with this church.

108
00:07:26,383 --> 00:07:28,101
Well, you're right about that.

Everyone's in position.
How's the weather?

123
00:08:31,503 --> 00:08:33,858

Hey, it's cold out there, man!
I stomped my feet for five minutes.

131
00:09:27,343 --> 00:09:29,698
Two cappuccinos. Make it fast.

132
00:09:49,143 --> 00:09:51,862
- Scotch straight up, please.
- Excuse me, officers.

133
00:09:51,943 --> 00:09:55,253
This may sound like a wild-goose chase,
but I think I saw...

134
00:09:56,783 --> 00:09:58,421
Saw what?

135
00:09:59,343 --> 00:10:01,982
Elvis. Elvis Presley.

136
00:10:04,143 --> 00:10:07,021
Fucking tourists. Ought to be a law.

137
00:10:07,103 --> 00:10:09,822
There's a lot from
the Justice Department here.

138
00:10:09,903 --> 00:10:12,736
- Is there a reason for that?
- Just routine.

139
00:10:12,823 --> 00:10:14,051

- Yes.

140
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:16,577

- Not now.

141
00:10:16,663 --> 00:10:18,654
Thank you, sir. Thanks.

Hey, that's Colonel Stuart over there.

143
00:10:25,943 --> 00:10:30,016
Got a little problem with personnel.
Last-minute replacement.

How's the security here?

145
00:10:32,143 --> 00:10:33,974
Like we figured... a joke.

146
00:10:34,063 --> 00:10:36,258
Colonel Stuart,
could we have a few words?

147
00:10:36,343 --> 00:10:38,573
You can have two: fuck and you.

148
00:10:38,663 --> 00:10:41,257
No pictures, you pinko bitch.

149
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:45,174
Old news.

150
00:10:57,143 --> 00:10:59,134
Oh! Damn it!

151
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:01,971
Excuse me.

152
00:11:04,783 --> 00:11:05,818
Excuse me.

00:11:07,503 --> 00:11:09,494
Thank you.

154
00:11:22,383 --> 00:11:23,213
Hey, man.

155
00:11:25,743 --> 00:11:28,416
- What is it?
- You got a key for this door?

156
00:11:28,503 --> 00:11:29,982
Yeah. Why?

157
00:11:30,063 --> 00:11:33,135
Because I want you
to open it up, that's why.

158
00:11:34,703 --> 00:11:38,776
- Is there a cop on duty around here?
- The airport police.

159
00:11:38,863 --> 00:11:40,182
Go get them.

160
00:12:03,503 --> 00:12:05,300
(laughing)

161
00:12:05,983 --> 00:12:08,019
(man) Hand me the wrench.

162
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:11,015
- Going to work overtime.
- (man #2) Good idea.

163
00:12:12,383 --> 00:12:14,374
OK, hold that end.

164
00:12:15,263 --> 00:12:16,662
Watch it, man.

165
00:12:17,463 --> 00:12:21,934
All right. Perfect.
Perfect. Good to go.

166
00:12:22,023 --> 00:12:23,297
Hey!

167
00:12:25,103 --> 00:12:27,537
It's a restricted area.
What's the matter?

168
00:12:27,623 --> 00:12:29,932
- Couldn't wait for the skycap?
- We work here.

169
00:12:30,023 --> 00:12:31,979
Let's see some ID.

170
00:12:32,503 --> 00:12:35,973
- (sniggers)
- Sure. No problem.

171
00:13:13,983 --> 00:13:16,736
Oh, jeez. Fuck!

172
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:03,221
What is this, a tag team?

173
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:25,260
Agh!

174
00:14:26,463 --> 00:14:28,852
(screaming)

175
00:14:35,063 --> 00:14:37,736
You say he came in here
and flashed a badge?

176
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:40,462
Yeah. He said to bring you guys back here.

177
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:44,780
Ugh! Agh!

178
00:14:52,463 --> 00:14:55,023
Aagh! Aagh! Aagh!

179
00:15:06,063 --> 00:15:07,940
(glass breaks)

180
00:15:17,463 --> 00:15:19,101
(bicycle bell rings)

181
00:15:23,263 --> 00:15:24,855
Fucker!

182
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:27,782
Freeze!

183
00:15:29,223 --> 00:15:32,693
Nice guess, asshole.
I'm a cop. That was the bad guy.

184
00:15:32,783 --> 00:15:34,819
Where's your ID?

185
00:15:39,663 --> 00:15:41,335
On its way to Cleveland?

186
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:48,574
No, you did not explain anything.

187
00:15:48,663 --> 00:15:51,416
You just shoved me back here
into this cattle car.

188
00:15:51,503 --> 00:15:53,573
Sir, you were told we were overbooked.

189
00:15:53,663 --> 00:15:55,142
Fine. Done. I accept that.

190
00:15:55,223 --> 00:15:58,295
But why can't I get the first-class
meal my network paid for?

191
00:15:58,383 --> 00:16:01,181
- Do you know who I am?
- Yes. We've seen your programme.

192
00:16:01,263 --> 00:16:05,142
Your episode, Flying Junkyards, was
an objective look at air traffic safety.

193
00:16:05,223 --> 00:16:09,102
It wasn't nearly as edifying as
Bimbos Of The Sky, was it, Connie?

194
00:16:09,183 --> 00:16:10,775
You think you're funny.

195
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,457
You think you're funny.

196
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,261
Fine.

197
00:16:14,343 --> 00:16:15,617
I've got your number.

198
00:16:15,703 --> 00:16:17,102
And I've got yours.

199
00:16:17,183 --> 00:16:19,333
So park it, sir.

200
00:16:20,863 --> 00:16:22,421
Fine.

201
00:16:31,343 --> 00:16:32,662
Stewardess.

202
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:34,176
Mr Thornberg,...

203
00:16:34,263 --> 00:16:36,015
..you cannot monopolise my time.

204
00:16:36,103 --> 00:16:37,741
You cannot put me near that woman.

205
00:16:37,823 --> 00:16:39,256
Excuse me?

206
00:16:40,743 --> 00:16:43,974
He means he's filed
a restraining order against me.

207
00:16:44,063 --> 00:16:47,021
I'm not allowed within 50 feet of him.

208
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,218
50 yards.

209
00:16:49,063 --> 00:16:52,578
So by keeping me in this section,
you are violating a court order.

210
00:16:52,663 --> 00:16:54,733
I can sue you and this airline.

211
00:16:56,063 --> 00:17:00,136
That woman assaulted me,
and she humiliated me in public.

212
00:17:06,623 --> 00:17:08,056
What did you do?

213
00:17:10,023 --> 00:17:12,378
Knocked out two of his teeth.

214
00:17:12,463 --> 00:17:15,375
Would you like some champagne?

215
00:17:18,623 --> 00:17:21,421
Sorry, Officer McClane.
I had to check.

216
00:17:21,503 --> 00:17:23,892
Here's your piece and shield back.

217
00:17:24,663 --> 00:17:25,937
Thanks.

218
00:17:26,023 --> 00:17:27,172
(reporter) Over here, offiicer!

219
00:17:27,263 --> 00:17:29,413
We understand that there was shooting.

220
00:17:29,503 --> 00:17:32,575
..the presence
of Justice Department offiicials?

221
00:17:32,663 --> 00:17:35,052
Jesus!

222
00:17:35,663 --> 00:17:38,621
What the fuck are you people...
What are you doing?

223
00:17:38,703 --> 00:17:41,661
This is a crime scene.
You got to seal this area off.

224
00:17:41,743 --> 00:17:42,858
That's up to the captain.

225
00:17:42,943 --> 00:17:47,221
Maybe you better take me
up to the captain, then, huh?

226
00:17:57,063 --> 00:17:59,623
- Where's Cochrane?
- He didn't make it.

227
00:18:07,623 --> 00:18:09,102
You're late.

228
00:18:10,463 --> 00:18:12,693
We ran into trouble, Colonel.

229
00:18:12,783 --> 00:18:18,540
Some cop... killed Cochrane.
I barely got away, sir.

230
00:18:18,623 --> 00:18:20,773
Did you accomplish your mission?

231
00:18:20,863 --> 00:18:23,172
Yes, sir, but... Cochrane, sir.

232
00:18:23,263 --> 00:18:26,858
Well, then the damage is minimal.
The penalty could be severe.

233
00:18:35,023 --> 00:18:38,220
You fail me again,
and the chamber won't be empty.

234
00:18:39,623 --> 00:18:41,102
Dismissed.

235
00:18:44,263 --> 00:18:46,731
Miss. Miss. I can't find my dog.

236
00:18:46,823 --> 00:18:49,576
- Miss. My dog.
- One minute, ma'am.

237
00:18:49,663 --> 00:18:51,619
I want you to fill out this form.

238
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:57,492
(knock on door)

239
00:18:57,583 --> 00:19:00,177
Who is it? Come in.

240
00:19:00,263 --> 00:19:02,299
- Captain Lorenzo?
- Yeah.

241
00:19:02,383 --> 00:19:05,022
- I'm John McClane...
- Yeah, I know who you are.

242
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:09,494
You're the asshole that just broke
seven FAA and five district regulations...

243
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:12,814
..running around my airport
with a gun, shooting at people.

244
00:19:12,903 --> 00:19:14,541
What do you call that shit?

245
00:19:14,623 --> 00:19:15,851
Self-defence.

246
00:19:15,943 --> 00:19:18,059
What, you think that LA badge...

247
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:21,977
..is going to get you a free lunch
or something around here?

248
00:19:22,063 --> 00:19:24,372
Maybe a little professional courtesy.

249
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:26,613
Huh! ln an airport on Christmas week?

250
00:19:26,703 --> 00:19:28,182
You've got to be kidding.

251
00:19:28,263 --> 00:19:30,902
OK, fuck courtesy.
How about being professional?

252
00:19:30,983 --> 00:19:32,974
Your boys just walked away
from a crime scene.

253
00:19:33,063 --> 00:19:35,452
You can't wrap this up in ten minutes.

254
00:19:35,543 --> 00:19:37,977
You got to seal the area off,
dust for prints...

255
00:19:38,063 --> 00:19:40,099
Hey, don't lecture me, hotshot.

256
00:19:40,183 --> 00:19:43,095
I know what I'm doing.
We're going to dust it down.

257
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:46,414
We'll take all the pictures.
We'll sweep for fibres.

258
00:19:46,503 --> 00:19:49,017
When will you do this?
After 400 people go through?

259
00:19:49,103 --> 00:19:50,900
You'd be lucky to get a print
from one of your people.

260
00:19:50,983 --> 00:19:53,702
- Shut down that area...
- Oh, shut the area down.

261
00:19:53,783 --> 00:19:56,377
It's that simple, huh?
Just shut the area down?

262
00:19:56,463 --> 00:20:00,376
Yeah, and I got everybody
from the Shriners' convention...

263
00:20:00,463 --> 00:20:02,772
..to the goddamn Boy Scouts in here!

264
00:20:02,863 --> 00:20:04,774
I got lost kids, lost dogs...

265
00:20:04,863 --> 00:20:06,854
Not now! Later!

266
00:20:06,943 --> 00:20:08,092
I got international diplomats.

267
00:20:08,183 --> 00:20:12,176
I got a fucking reindeer flying in here
from the fucking petting zoo!

268
00:20:12,263 --> 00:20:15,300
But John McClane,
he's got a little problem.

269
00:20:15,383 --> 00:20:17,533
Let's shut down
the whole fucking airport!

270
00:20:17,623 --> 00:20:20,535
What do you think they'll say
upstairs when I tell them that?

271
00:20:20,623 --> 00:20:21,942
Phone and find out.

272
00:20:22,023 --> 00:20:26,778
I don't need fucking forensics to tell me
this was some punk stealing luggage!

273
00:20:26,863 --> 00:20:29,297
Luggage?
That punk pulled a Glock 7 on me.

274
00:20:29,383 --> 00:20:31,692
That's a porcelain gun made in Germany.

275
00:20:31,783 --> 00:20:33,933
It doesn't show up
on airport x-ray machines...

276
00:20:34,023 --> 00:20:35,900
..and costs more
than you make in a month.

277
00:20:35,983 --> 00:20:38,019
You'd be surprised what I make in a month.

278
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:39,934
If it's more than $1.98...

279
00:20:40,023 --> 00:20:43,095
Hey, McClane, don't start
believing your own press, huh?

280
00:20:43,183 --> 00:20:46,414
Yeah, I know all about you
and that Nakatomi thing in LA.

281
00:20:46,503 --> 00:20:49,939
But just cos the TV thinks
you're hot shit, that don't make it so.

282
00:20:50,023 --> 00:20:52,901
Look, you are in my little pond now,...

283
00:20:52,983 --> 00:20:56,134
..and I am the big fish that runs it.

284
00:20:56,223 --> 00:20:58,896
So you capped some lowlife.

285
00:20:58,983 --> 00:20:59,938
Fine.

286
00:21:00,023 --> 00:21:03,732
I'll send your fucking captain in LA
a fucking commendation!

287
00:21:03,823 --> 00:21:05,700
Now, get the hell out of my office...

288
00:21:05,783 --> 00:21:08,616
..before I have you thrown out
of my goddamn airport!

289
00:21:18,663 --> 00:21:20,972
Hey, Carmine, let me ask you something.

290
00:21:21,063 --> 00:21:23,418
What sets off the metal detectors first:

291
00:21:23,503 --> 00:21:26,017
the lead in your ass
or the shit in your brains?

292
00:21:26,103 --> 00:21:27,855
Fat fuck.

293
00:21:36,783 --> 00:21:38,660
(man) AnyID on this guy?

294
00:21:38,743 --> 00:21:40,734
(man #2) That's somebody else's problem.

295
00:21:42,903 --> 00:21:45,292
Your car's ready. Sign right here.

296
00:21:45,383 --> 00:21:49,012
I need to borrow this and this.
I'll bring it right back.

297
00:21:49,103 --> 00:21:50,218
Hey!

298
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:53,261
Hey! Yo! Hold up!

299
00:21:53,983 --> 00:21:54,779
Yo!

300
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:58,018
Hold up, boys.

301
00:21:58,103 --> 00:21:59,855
Hold up. We got to check something.

302
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:02,855
- What are you doing?
- Pretty gruesome fucking job.

303
00:22:02,943 --> 00:22:08,415
All the confusion in there,
forgot to get this clown's prints.

304
00:22:10,223 --> 00:22:11,372
Ew! Christ.

305
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:13,613
You're supposed to do that at the morgue.

306
00:22:13,703 --> 00:22:17,139
Not anymore. Got a new SOP
for DOAs from the FAA.

307
00:22:20,183 --> 00:22:22,856
(laughs) I don't think
this one's going to make it.

308
00:22:22,943 --> 00:22:24,058
Thanks a lot.

309
00:22:32,863 --> 00:22:34,501
(speaks Spanish)

310
00:22:58,063 --> 00:23:00,054
(groans)

311
00:24:09,183 --> 00:24:11,572
(rings)

312
00:24:12,783 --> 00:24:14,102
Powell here.

313
00:24:14,183 --> 00:24:16,617
Take that Twinkie
out of your mouth and grab a pencil.

314
00:24:16,703 --> 00:24:19,263
(laughs) Hey, John, how are you doing?

315
00:24:19,343 --> 00:24:22,699
Holly stood me up a day
and I'm here alone in DC...

316
00:24:22,783 --> 00:24:24,580
..with my in-laws.

317
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:26,494
Eh, the old in-laws, huh?

318
00:24:26,583 --> 00:24:28,938
They do love
their policemen son-in-laws.

319
00:24:29,023 --> 00:24:33,574
Listen, Al, what is the fax machine
number there at the station?

320
00:24:33,663 --> 00:24:35,574
Uh...

321
00:24:35,663 --> 00:24:38,939
555 3212.

322
00:24:39,023 --> 00:24:41,821
3212. Hold on a second, all right?

323
00:24:41,903 --> 00:24:43,859
I want to send you something.

324
00:24:43,943 --> 00:24:45,171
Excuse me.

325
00:24:45,263 --> 00:24:47,572
You and faxes? This is a fiirst.

326
00:24:47,663 --> 00:24:51,053
Holly told me I should wake up
and smell the nineties.

327
00:24:51,143 --> 00:24:54,101
- This way?
- No. That way.

328
00:24:54,183 --> 00:24:56,538
- Wait. It's upside-down.
- It doesn't matter.

329
00:24:56,623 --> 00:24:58,773
OK, here it comes.

330
00:25:00,383 --> 00:25:01,782
I'm sending you something now.

331
00:25:01,863 --> 00:25:04,582
Hold on a second, cowboy.

332
00:25:17,783 --> 00:25:19,580
Fingerprints?

333
00:25:19,663 --> 00:25:21,574
We've got an unidentifiied stiffshere.

334
00:25:21,663 --> 00:25:24,735
I've circled the whorls in pen
in case the transmission's fuzzy.

335
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:27,496
Run it through State and Federal,
and if you can, lnterpol.

336
00:25:27,583 --> 00:25:29,813
Will do. Well, what's this about?

337
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:31,336
Oh, just a feeling I have.

338
00:25:31,423 --> 00:25:35,621
Ouch. When you get those feelings,
insurance companies start to go bankrupt.

339
00:25:35,703 --> 00:25:38,422
Listen, the, uh, fax number is...

340
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:40,300
On the top of the transmission...

341
00:25:40,383 --> 00:25:44,376
On the top of the transmission you just got.

342
00:25:45,783 --> 00:25:46,932
Oh, an airport, huh?

343
00:25:47,023 --> 00:25:49,981
You're not pissing
in somebody's pool, are you?

344
00:25:50,063 --> 00:25:53,294
(laughs)
Yeah, and I'm fresh out of chlorine.

345
00:25:58,783 --> 00:26:01,422
Just as this storm starts breaking,...

346
00:26:01,503 --> 00:26:04,734
..the satellite will feed up
and drop the other shoe.

347
00:26:04,823 --> 00:26:06,779
Look at this new front moving in.

348
00:26:06,863 --> 00:26:08,740
Makes its baby brother
look like chicken shit.

349
00:26:10,343 --> 00:26:14,734
I can sand down the runway
and run the ploughs between landings...

350
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:17,257
..if you downshift them,
give me time to work.

351
00:26:17,343 --> 00:26:18,332
You got it.

352
00:26:19,263 --> 00:26:20,776
All right, everyone.

353
00:26:20,863 --> 00:26:25,300
Let's slow down our birds before
we get a parking lot over our heads.

354
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:27,817
The line starts at the Mississippi,...

355
00:26:27,903 --> 00:26:30,463
..and they better start taking numbers.

356
00:26:39,063 --> 00:26:40,894
Can I get you another?

357
00:26:43,783 --> 00:26:45,182
No, thank you.

358
00:26:45,263 --> 00:26:48,096
I only have to look at his face
for another 20 minutes.

359
00:26:48,983 --> 00:26:52,055
(PA) Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the captain speaking.

360
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:54,782
I've just been informed
by Dulles traffiic control...

361
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,979
..that there's a weather front ahead ofus.

362
00:26:57,583 --> 00:27:00,495
We may be up here
a little while longer.

363
00:27:00,583 --> 00:27:02,062
Thank you.

364
00:27:02,143 --> 00:27:03,895
On second thoughts...

365
00:27:09,583 --> 00:27:11,335
- (rings)
- Al?

366
00:27:11,423 --> 00:27:13,334
Hey, I'm right here, partner.

367
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:16,142
Your stiffs dossier is
coming through now.

368
00:27:18,063 --> 00:27:20,452
- What can you tell me about him?
- He's dead.

369
00:27:20,543 --> 00:27:22,579
You needed a computer
to figure that out?

370
00:27:22,663 --> 00:27:24,494
No, no. You don't follow me.

371
00:27:24,583 --> 00:27:28,496
According to the Department Of Defence,
he's been dead for two years.

372
00:27:28,583 --> 00:27:29,936
What?

373
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:32,662
That's right.
Sergeant Oswald Cochrane.

374
00:27:32,743 --> 00:27:34,381
American adviser in Honduras.

375
00:27:34,463 --> 00:27:37,853
Killed in a helicopter accident 5-11-88.

376
00:27:37,943 --> 00:27:39,535
Officer.

377
00:27:39,623 --> 00:27:43,821
Read between the lines, andl'd say
it looks like a lot ofblack-bag stuff.

378
00:27:43,903 --> 00:27:45,222
Yeah, I see it.

379
00:27:45,303 --> 00:27:47,692
- All right, Al. Thanks a lot.
- Hey, any time.

380
00:27:47,783 --> 00:27:49,102
OK.

381
00:27:50,463 --> 00:27:54,854
Say, I close in about an hour.
Maybe we can go get a drink?

382
00:27:57,503 --> 00:28:00,222
Just the fax, ma'am. Just the fax.

383
00:28:05,063 --> 00:28:08,100
Hey, wait a second. I see somebody.
I'll call you back.

384
00:28:13,663 --> 00:28:15,494
The ghost of Christmas past.

385
00:28:15,583 --> 00:28:18,097
Nakatomi? LA?
You're John McClane, right?

386
00:28:18,183 --> 00:28:19,775
- Who are you?
- Sam Coleman.

387
00:28:19,863 --> 00:28:20,693
WNTW News.

388
00:28:21,863 --> 00:28:23,091
Excuse me.

389
00:28:23,183 --> 00:28:25,174
Give me a break. I saw the stiff.

390
00:28:25,263 --> 00:28:27,697
Word is that was your handiwork.

391
00:28:27,783 --> 00:28:30,092
No. I only do needlepoint.

392
00:28:35,103 --> 00:28:38,652
Great. National just shut down.
Totally iced.

393
00:28:38,743 --> 00:28:40,540
They'll send us their planes.

394
00:28:40,623 --> 00:28:41,772
Happy, happy holiday.

395
00:28:41,863 --> 00:28:44,138
The worst part, Mr Trudeau,
was the press.

396
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:46,657
They were here for the Esperanza story,...

397
00:28:46,743 --> 00:28:50,372
..so they got it right on the fucking news,
bloodstains and all.

398
00:28:50,463 --> 00:28:53,341
I'd like to lock every damn reporter
out of the airport,...

399
00:28:53,423 --> 00:28:56,142
..but they'd pull
that freedom-of-speech crap on us.

400
00:28:56,223 --> 00:28:58,020
Then the ACLU would be all over us.

401
00:28:58,103 --> 00:29:02,016
Murder on television.
Hell of a start for Christmas week.

402
00:29:02,103 --> 00:29:05,573
What is it?
A gang thing like last time?

403
00:29:05,663 --> 00:29:08,416
Only if your gangs get
their training at Fort Bragg.

404
00:29:09,903 --> 00:29:11,416
- Who the hell is this?
- Uh-uh, McClane.

405
00:29:11,503 --> 00:29:14,336
- I'm a police officer...
- In an unauthorised area.

406
00:29:14,423 --> 00:29:16,220
LA, Mr Trudeau, don't mean shit.

407
00:29:16,303 --> 00:29:18,897
That's what I said about
my last cholesterol test.

408
00:29:18,983 --> 00:29:22,532
So what's your problem,
Lieutenant McClane?

409
00:29:23,983 --> 00:29:25,939
I'm sure Captain Lorenzo explained...

410
00:29:26,023 --> 00:29:28,218
..the minor fracas with the minor thieves.

411
00:29:28,303 --> 00:29:30,453
Maybe he can explain this.

412
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:50,136
All systems tapped, Colonel.

413
00:29:50,223 --> 00:29:51,417
Fire it up.

414
00:30:06,023 --> 00:30:09,413
H minus five minutes. Stand by.

415
00:30:10,463 --> 00:30:14,297
OK, we've got a body in the morgue
that seems to have died twice.

416
00:30:14,383 --> 00:30:16,943
Assuming it's not a computer error,
what do we assume?

417
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:19,253
That somebody's about
to fuck with this airport.

418
00:30:19,343 --> 00:30:21,220
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

419
00:30:21,303 --> 00:30:25,057
I know we're dummies up here,
so give us a taste of your genius.

420
00:30:25,143 --> 00:30:27,338
This is a hijacking, a robbery or what?

421
00:30:27,423 --> 00:30:30,893
- Look, I'm not sure...
- Oh, he's not sure. I'm stunned(!)

422
00:30:30,983 --> 00:30:32,336
I got to lie down.

423
00:30:32,423 --> 00:30:34,539
Only professionals go to this much trouble.

424
00:30:34,623 --> 00:30:36,341
Not luggage thieves and not punks.

425
00:30:36,423 --> 00:30:39,142
- Professional at what?
- What the fuck do you think this is?

426
00:30:39,223 --> 00:30:40,292
The safety patrol?

427
00:30:40,383 --> 00:30:42,294
This is the résumé
of a professional mercenary.

428
00:30:42,383 --> 00:30:44,339
The world's biggest drug dealer
is due here.

429
00:30:44,423 --> 00:30:46,015
You need a slide rule to solve this,...

430
00:30:46,103 --> 00:30:48,981
..or another body in a bag
before you ask questions?

431
00:30:49,063 --> 00:30:52,294
You're the one that gave us
that fucking body. Remember that.

432
00:30:52,383 --> 00:30:53,782
Yeah, I remember that.

433
00:31:00,623 --> 00:31:04,582
Lorenzo, have all your shift
commanders report in. Now.

434
00:31:04,663 --> 00:31:05,732
You're not buying into this?!

435
00:31:05,823 --> 00:31:09,259
They're to report anything unusual,
however trivial. Got that?

436
00:31:09,343 --> 00:31:10,378
Yeah, I got it.

437
00:31:10,463 --> 00:31:12,738
- Oh, my God!
- What?

438
00:31:12,823 --> 00:31:16,020
- The runways.
- What the hell?

439
00:31:16,103 --> 00:31:18,571
- They're shutting down.
- Jesus Christ.

440
00:31:24,463 --> 00:31:26,658
Go to emergency lighting now.

441
00:31:27,143 --> 00:31:29,577
Emergency. We are in a code yellow.

442
00:31:29,663 --> 00:31:31,415
Backup systems won't come up.

443
00:31:31,503 --> 00:31:34,301
- Shunt to another terminal.
- Bobby, what have you got?

444
00:31:34,383 --> 00:31:37,898
- Nothing. The network is down.
- Should we call the power company?

445
00:31:37,983 --> 00:31:39,735
We're on the same goddamn grid.
We're hot.

446
00:31:39,823 --> 00:31:41,654
(radio)
Dulles, what's going on? I'm on approach.

447
00:31:41,743 --> 00:31:44,974
- Maintain position. Repeat.
- What's going on down there?

448
00:31:45,063 --> 00:31:46,291
Roger. We're on it.

449
00:31:46,383 --> 00:31:48,943
- We're unable right now. Delay.
- Fuji 604.

450
00:31:49,023 --> 00:31:52,015
Execute published missed-approach
procedure and hold.

451
00:31:52,103 --> 00:31:54,617
TWA 23, unable to clear you
for approach at this time.

452
00:31:54,703 --> 00:31:57,217
Climb to and maintain one zero thousand.

453
00:31:57,303 --> 00:32:00,340
I've checked all systems.
It ain't happening.

454
00:32:12,703 --> 00:32:13,692
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

455
00:32:13,783 --> 00:32:17,139
- What's it look like?
- Approach control, it's gone.

456
00:32:17,223 --> 00:32:20,295
Jesus!
lnstrument landing system is down.

457
00:32:21,303 --> 00:32:23,533
Confirmed. ILS is dead.

458
00:32:23,623 --> 00:32:25,978
Every goddamn system's dead.

459
00:32:26,063 --> 00:32:28,577
And INMAC monitors are down.

460
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:36,417
Attention all controllers.
Attention. We have a code-red alert.

461
00:32:36,503 --> 00:32:39,222
(PA) Every aircraft approaching our sector...

462
00:32:39,303 --> 00:32:41,294
..and not already in our landing pattern...

463
00:32:41,383 --> 00:32:43,453
..gets diverted to their alternate airport.

464
00:32:43,543 --> 00:32:47,422
Everyone already on approach
or inside our pattern...

465
00:32:47,503 --> 00:32:49,812
..holds at the outer markers.

466
00:32:49,903 --> 00:32:52,497
Stack 'em, pack 'em, and rack 'em.

467
00:32:52,583 --> 00:32:53,732
Move.

468
00:32:54,783 --> 00:32:56,216
Get someone on it!

469
00:32:56,303 --> 00:32:57,531
(beeping)

470
00:32:59,263 --> 00:33:01,902
All right.
Not a word of this leaves this room.

471
00:33:01,983 --> 00:33:04,451
There must be 15,000 people
in this airport,...

472
00:33:04,543 --> 00:33:06,056
..and we don't need panic.

473
00:33:06,143 --> 00:33:09,055
We just bought ourselves
maybe two hours.

474
00:33:09,143 --> 00:33:11,941
After that,
planes low on fuel won't be circling.

475
00:33:12,023 --> 00:33:14,583
They'll be dropping
on the White House lawn.

476
00:33:17,223 --> 00:33:20,533
McClane, is this what you expected?

477
00:33:21,983 --> 00:33:23,735
No.

478
00:33:23,823 --> 00:33:25,814
This is just the beginning.

479
00:33:26,983 --> 00:33:29,702
(beeping)

480
00:33:29,783 --> 00:33:31,057
FAA hot line.

481
00:33:31,143 --> 00:33:32,781
How could they know already?

482
00:33:32,863 --> 00:33:34,137
They can't.

483
00:33:35,903 --> 00:33:37,894
Maybe it's the boys
who pulled your plugs.

484
00:33:37,983 --> 00:33:39,814
Put it on speaker.

485
00:33:41,103 --> 00:33:44,061
(speaker)
Attention, Dulles tower. Attention.

486
00:33:44,143 --> 00:33:47,533
They say blind men become very
attentive by way ofcompensation.

487
00:33:47,623 --> 00:33:51,252
Now thatyou're blind and deaf,
I think I've gotyour attention.

488
00:33:51,343 --> 00:33:54,574
I'm aware your recorders are active,
so I'll be quick.

489
00:33:54,663 --> 00:33:57,700
You can play me back later
to your heart's content.

490
00:33:57,783 --> 00:34:00,217
How did you get on this line?
Who is this?

491
00:34:01,023 --> 00:34:02,741
Who I am is unimportant.

492
00:34:02,823 --> 00:34:04,017
What I want...

493
00:34:04,103 --> 00:34:08,016
Well, if you don't want those planes
to start splashing into the Potomac...

494
00:34:08,103 --> 00:34:10,856
..as they run out of fuel,
what I want is very important.

495
00:34:10,943 --> 00:34:14,333
A plane will be landing
at this airport in 58 minutes.

496
00:34:14,423 --> 00:34:17,574
It is FM-1 : Foreign Military One.

497
00:34:17,663 --> 00:34:21,338
- I'm sure you are aware ofthe nature...
- Esperanza?

498
00:34:21,423 --> 00:34:23,778
..of this flight, the importance ofits cargo.

499
00:34:23,863 --> 00:34:26,900
This plane will not be met by anyone.

500
00:34:26,983 --> 00:34:29,895
It will land on a runway
of my designation,...

501
00:34:29,983 --> 00:34:33,339
..where it will remain
isolated and unapproached.

502
00:34:33,423 --> 00:34:35,812
That will conclude
my interest in this aircraft...

503
00:34:35,903 --> 00:34:37,541
..and your responsibility for it.

504
00:34:37,623 --> 00:34:41,502
At the same time,
I want a 747 cargo conversion,...

505
00:34:41,583 --> 00:34:43,574
..fully fuelled...

506
00:34:43,663 --> 00:34:45,813
..and placed at my disposal.

507
00:34:45,903 --> 00:34:49,293
You have two more minutes
to advise inbound aircraft...

508
00:34:49,383 --> 00:34:50,736
..to hold at their outer radio marker.

509
00:34:50,823 --> 00:34:53,576
After that,
you will be able to receive only.

510
00:34:53,663 --> 00:34:56,382
Any attempt to restore your systems,
will be met...

511
00:34:56,463 --> 00:34:58,101
..by severe penalties.

512
00:34:58,183 --> 00:34:59,252
He's bluffing.

513
00:35:00,543 --> 00:35:01,771
Damn it, you can't do this.

514
00:35:01,863 --> 00:35:03,854
I am doing this.

515
00:35:11,463 --> 00:35:13,852
OK, listen up.
I need you to punch up a code 15.

516
00:35:13,943 --> 00:35:15,934
I got an idea, and I need your help.

517
00:35:16,023 --> 00:35:17,695
If Esperanza gets to a country...

518
00:35:17,783 --> 00:35:20,251
..with no extradition treaties,
we're fucked.

519
00:35:20,343 --> 00:35:23,415
They're talking to us on our own system.
They got to be close.

520
00:35:23,503 --> 00:35:25,380
My men will tear this airport apart.

521
00:35:25,463 --> 00:35:27,101
Just in the nick of time, huh?

522
00:35:27,183 --> 00:35:29,651
I got a first-class unit here,
SWAT team and all.

523
00:35:29,743 --> 00:35:32,303
We don't need
any Monday-morning quarterbacks.

524
00:35:32,383 --> 00:35:35,056
My wife's on one of the planes
they're fucking with!

525
00:35:35,143 --> 00:35:36,622
So I'm on the playing field.

526
00:35:36,703 --> 00:35:40,412
If you'd have moved your fat ass before,
we wouldn't be deep in shit now.

527
00:35:40,543 --> 00:35:42,773
That's it. Security. You're out of here.

528
00:35:42,863 --> 00:35:44,899
Mr Trudeau, there are FAA regulations...

529
00:35:44,983 --> 00:35:47,941
..regarding unauthorised personnel
in the control tower!

530
00:35:48,023 --> 00:35:49,979
We just have to find a way to transmit.

531
00:35:50,063 --> 00:35:52,702
Somebody want to run
to Radio Shack for a transmitter?

532
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:55,251
We have one -
the terminal wing they're building.

533
00:35:55,343 --> 00:35:56,935
20 airlines when it's done,...

534
00:35:57,023 --> 00:36:00,333
..all with reservation computers
in a nice antenna arrangement.

535
00:36:00,423 --> 00:36:04,018
- See Mr McClane out.
- You got no business being up here.

536
00:36:04,103 --> 00:36:06,697
Everything we need
is by the annexe skywalk...

537
00:36:06,783 --> 00:36:09,297
..just sitting there, waiting to go on line.

538
00:36:09,383 --> 00:36:11,897
Goddammit, Trudeau,
you're dealing with pros.

539
00:36:11,983 --> 00:36:13,780
You can't fuck with these people!

540
00:36:13,863 --> 00:36:15,376
Sam Coleman. WNTW News.

541
00:36:15,463 --> 00:36:18,023
There are a lot of rumours flying around.

542
00:36:18,103 --> 00:36:20,378
No way. No way, lady.
Hell, no. No.

543
00:36:20,463 --> 00:36:22,533
This is off limits, Coleman.

544
00:36:22,623 --> 00:36:24,181
(Captain) Get them out of here!

545
00:36:24,263 --> 00:36:26,777
Anything you can think of,
they'll think of, too!

546
00:36:26,863 --> 00:36:28,660
Get your fucking hands off me.

547
00:36:28,743 --> 00:36:30,574
(Captain) Just get them out of here.

548
00:36:32,063 --> 00:36:32,779
Lobby security,...

549
00:36:32,863 --> 00:36:34,615
- ..come in.
- Tomalson here.

550
00:36:34,703 --> 00:36:36,295
This is Captain Lorenzo.

551
00:36:36,383 --> 00:36:38,499
We've two unauthorised personnel
in the tower.

552
00:36:38,583 --> 00:36:40,380
Would you get your thumb
out of your ass?

553
00:36:40,463 --> 00:36:44,172
Get them out ofthe elevator,
or you'll get a pink slip for Christmas.

554
00:36:44,263 --> 00:36:46,652
10-4. Let's go.

555
00:36:46,743 --> 00:36:48,461
Goddamn!

556
00:36:49,343 --> 00:36:51,777
Anything who can think of?
Can't fuck with who?

557
00:36:51,863 --> 00:36:53,182
Shit. Hang on over there.

558
00:36:53,263 --> 00:36:54,378
- What for?
- Just hang on!

559
00:36:54,863 --> 00:36:57,616
Big drug dealer on his way to prison.

560
00:36:57,703 --> 00:36:59,375
Gunfight at airport.

561
00:36:59,463 --> 00:37:02,261
Every controller in the coffee shop
getting beeped,...

562
00:37:02,343 --> 00:37:03,742
..and you rocking the boat.

563
00:37:03,823 --> 00:37:06,291
Connection? Come on, McClane.
Just a few words.

564
00:37:06,383 --> 00:37:07,941
OK, just a few words. Fuck off.

565
00:37:08,023 --> 00:37:11,140
Thanks, but I already got
that from Colonel Stuart.

566
00:37:12,583 --> 00:37:16,735
Stuart. The guy that got canned
by Congress. That's who he was.

567
00:37:16,823 --> 00:37:18,336
Who he who? What? Hey...

568
00:37:18,423 --> 00:37:21,654
Shh! It's OK, I've done this before.

569
00:37:31,863 --> 00:37:33,182
- Hey.
- Hi.

570
00:37:34,063 --> 00:37:36,054
- Where's the other one?
- Claustrophobic, I guess.

571
00:37:38,463 --> 00:37:41,660
It's a VHF system,
but the planes are so close, it's OK.

572
00:37:41,743 --> 00:37:44,701
I can rig our frequency in 30 minutes,
and wire in a crossover.

573
00:37:44,783 --> 00:37:47,092
Even the planes wouldn't
know the difference.

574
00:37:47,423 --> 00:37:49,891
Get what you need.
Borrow. Steal. Kill.

575
00:37:49,983 --> 00:37:52,178
I want my SWAT team
to go with him as cover.

576
00:37:52,263 --> 00:37:54,902
Whatever we can think of,
they can think of, too.

577
00:38:00,263 --> 00:38:02,697
Oh, man. I can't fucking believe this.

578
00:38:02,783 --> 00:38:05,058
Another basement. Another elevator.

579
00:38:05,143 --> 00:38:08,374
How can the same shit happen
to the same guy twice?

580
00:38:24,663 --> 00:38:27,177
(distant music)

581
00:38:28,783 --> 00:38:30,774
(What the fuck?)

582
00:38:30,863 --> 00:38:32,854
# Old Cape Cod

583
00:38:42,063 --> 00:38:48,218
# lf you like the taste of a lobster stew

584
00:38:48,903 --> 00:38:54,500
# Served by a window with an ocean view

585
00:38:55,103 --> 00:39:01,815
# You're sure to fall in love
with Old Cape Cod

586
00:39:04,463 --> 00:39:05,418
Who are you?

587
00:39:06,863 --> 00:39:10,492
I'm Marvin. Marvin. I'm Marvin.

588
00:39:10,583 --> 00:39:13,143
I thought you was trying
to steal my records.

589
00:39:13,863 --> 00:39:16,138
I'm just the janitor.

590
00:39:22,263 --> 00:39:24,219
This is Dulles approach to all aircraft...

591
00:39:24,303 --> 00:39:26,214
..holding at Potomac vortex.

592
00:39:26,303 --> 00:39:28,863
We are experiencing
some technicalproblems.

593
00:39:28,943 --> 00:39:31,013
Weather conditions,
which have deteriorated...

594
00:39:31,103 --> 00:39:35,415
..have now been complicated
by an unforeseen human factor.

595
00:39:35,503 --> 00:39:39,052
This has affected all
of our electronic equipment...

596
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:41,134
..and their redundant backups.

597
00:39:41,223 --> 00:39:44,772
As a result, our nav
and approach systems are down.

598
00:39:44,863 --> 00:39:47,093
We expect to lose
voice in another minute.

599
00:39:47,183 --> 00:39:48,536
We wantyou to continue...

600
00:39:48,623 --> 00:39:51,421
..holding at the outer marker
as directed...

601
00:39:51,503 --> 00:39:53,414
..and wait for further instructions.

602
00:39:53,503 --> 00:39:55,459
As soon as we're back on line,...

603
00:39:55,543 --> 00:39:58,615
..we'll expedite your landings
on a fuel-emergency basis.

604
00:40:00,023 --> 00:40:02,014
Good luck.

605
00:40:03,623 --> 00:40:05,420
God bless.

606
00:40:10,823 --> 00:40:12,017
OK, change the boards.

607
00:40:16,023 --> 00:40:18,662
(muttering)

608
00:40:22,463 --> 00:40:24,454
(phone rings)

609
00:40:39,343 --> 00:40:40,856
Hey, stand back.

610
00:40:40,943 --> 00:40:43,377
- The skywalk annexe.
- No! The annexe skywalk.

611
00:40:43,463 --> 00:40:46,739
It's the last thing I heard
before they kicked me out.

612
00:40:46,823 --> 00:40:48,973
Well, let me see here, now.

613
00:40:49,063 --> 00:40:50,781
Well, this must be it right there.

614
00:40:50,863 --> 00:40:55,414
See? That's the raised platform
and there's the new terminal.

615
00:40:55,503 --> 00:40:56,902
There's your skywalk.

616
00:40:57,463 --> 00:41:00,216
Goddamn bottleneck.
Nice place for an ambush.

617
00:41:01,703 --> 00:41:04,661
What's the fastest way
you can get me out to that spot?

618
00:41:07,143 --> 00:41:10,340
This kind of thing wasn't
in my job description.

619
00:41:10,423 --> 00:41:14,382
- Mr Barnes, we'll watch your back.
- Yeah? Who watches yours?

620
00:41:25,263 --> 00:41:27,060
Main ventilation duct.

621
00:41:27,903 --> 00:41:29,382
Ventilation duct...

622
00:41:30,303 --> 00:41:31,702
..and bingo.

623
00:41:31,783 --> 00:41:32,977
Just once,...

624
00:41:33,063 --> 00:41:36,339
..l'd like a regular, normal Christmas.

625
00:41:38,023 --> 00:41:42,733
Eggnog, a fucking Christmas tree,...

626
00:41:42,823 --> 00:41:44,734
..a little turkey.

627
00:41:44,823 --> 00:41:46,222
But, no!

628
00:41:46,303 --> 00:41:50,057
I got to crawl around
in this motherfucking tin can!

629
00:41:55,143 --> 00:41:57,293
We're in the annexe skywalk.
I can see the array.

630
00:41:57,383 --> 00:42:00,261
I'll give you a call
for a protocol test when it's hot.

631
00:42:00,343 --> 00:42:01,492
That's all for now.

632
00:42:01,583 --> 00:42:03,972
(Barnes)
Sergeant, we need more equipment.

633
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:05,860
I'd like to send one
of your guys for it.

634
00:42:05,943 --> 00:42:07,695
Right, sir. You got it.

635
00:42:09,663 --> 00:42:10,732
What the hell?

636
00:42:10,823 --> 00:42:12,495
What the hell's going on?

637
00:42:12,583 --> 00:42:14,619
Hey! Put that back on!

638
00:42:16,583 --> 00:42:19,256
Hey, asshole,
what do I look like to you?

639
00:42:20,023 --> 00:42:21,661
A sitting duck.

640
00:42:23,303 --> 00:42:24,338
Take him!

641
00:42:25,903 --> 00:42:26,858
Shit!

642
00:42:28,423 --> 00:42:31,620
Damn it. I hate it when I'm right.

643
00:42:35,743 --> 00:42:37,495
Look out! Get down!

644
00:42:48,583 --> 00:42:50,175
Aagh!

645
00:43:06,143 --> 00:43:07,701
Aagh!

646
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:23,942
(gunfiire)

647
00:43:25,943 --> 00:43:27,934
(gunfiire stops)

648
00:44:13,103 --> 00:44:14,331
Stay down!

649
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,817
Fuck!

650
00:44:37,943 --> 00:44:39,137
Come on.

651
00:44:59,303 --> 00:45:01,339
Fucking son of a bitch.

652
00:45:07,623 --> 00:45:08,578
Aagh!

653
00:45:18,063 --> 00:45:19,098
Shit.

654
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:21,096
Agh! Ugh!

655
00:45:29,103 --> 00:45:32,015
I'm going to kick your fucking ass.

656
00:46:03,823 --> 00:46:06,781
- Jeez.
- You all right?

657
00:46:06,863 --> 00:46:10,651
Yeah. But the antenna array,...
I got to get to it and set it up.

658
00:46:15,343 --> 00:46:16,492
Get down!

659
00:46:35,103 --> 00:46:37,139
(Goddamn.)

660
00:46:38,663 --> 00:46:39,891
Bait.

661
00:46:42,383 --> 00:46:43,862
Jerk us off.

662
00:46:43,943 --> 00:46:47,413
Make Lorenzo sacrifice his best men.

663
00:46:51,143 --> 00:46:53,611
Make you waste your time,...

664
00:46:56,423 --> 00:46:58,220
..time we don't have.

665
00:47:11,743 --> 00:47:14,132
I think you're closer than 50 yards.

666
00:47:14,223 --> 00:47:17,613
So's that airplane. Practically.

667
00:47:17,703 --> 00:47:19,819
Yeah. There's quite a few of them.

668
00:47:19,903 --> 00:47:21,859
It looks like a regular traffic jam.

669
00:47:21,943 --> 00:47:23,820
There's nothing regular about it.

670
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:26,260
See? You're intrigued.

671
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:28,937
That's my gift, Mrs McClane.
I notice things.

672
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:33,574
Things other people wouldn't see.
That's how I make people curious.

673
00:47:33,663 --> 00:47:35,415
Don't you mean nauseous?

674
00:47:35,503 --> 00:47:39,655
Look. The people have a right
to know everything about everybody.

675
00:47:39,743 --> 00:47:41,734
You got in the way of that.

676
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:44,542
Listen, buster.
You endangered my children.

677
00:47:44,623 --> 00:47:47,456
You didn't do it
for anything as noble as the people.

678
00:47:47,543 --> 00:47:49,181
The only time you see the people,...

679
00:47:49,263 --> 00:47:51,777
..is when you look down to see
what you're stepping on.

680
00:47:56,423 --> 00:47:58,414
Me? Yeah, I'll live.

681
00:47:58,503 --> 00:48:00,573
But Lorenzo's SWAT team is dead,...

682
00:48:00,663 --> 00:48:03,052
..and the antenna array is gone.

683
00:48:03,143 --> 00:48:05,213
- (beeping)
- Didn't you see it?!

684
00:48:06,663 --> 00:48:09,018
It's hard looking for a new miracle.

685
00:48:10,463 --> 00:48:13,296
(Barnes) Hold for a minute.
I'll be right back.

686
00:48:13,383 --> 00:48:15,374
Hold for a second.
Something's going on.

687
00:48:15,463 --> 00:48:18,261
Yeah. Just hold on for a minute.

688
00:48:18,343 --> 00:48:21,141
I say again, annexe team,
give us a sitrep.

689
00:48:22,343 --> 00:48:25,301
Annexe team, come in. Do you copy?

690
00:48:26,543 --> 00:48:28,215
It's got a scrambler on it.

691
00:48:28,303 --> 00:48:30,498
Can you do anything with it?

692
00:48:31,663 --> 00:48:35,451
No. This scramble mode
must activate on this code panel.

693
00:48:35,543 --> 00:48:38,501
Even if we scan their frequency,
we can't listen in.

694
00:48:38,583 --> 00:48:40,539
- These guys are pros.
- So are you. Break the code.

695
00:48:40,623 --> 00:48:42,614
I want to hear
what these bastards are saying.

696
00:48:42,703 --> 00:48:45,263
This is a ten-digit control panel.
Six-digit read-out.

697
00:48:45,343 --> 00:48:47,857
Hell, there could be
a million combinations.

698
00:48:47,943 --> 00:48:51,731
Next time you kill one of these guys,
get him to enter the code first.

699
00:48:51,823 --> 00:48:52,938
Yeah.

700
00:48:54,103 --> 00:48:57,334
Sir, we just monitored a call
from their Chief Engineer.

701
00:48:57,423 --> 00:48:59,891
We took out their SWAT team,
completely.

702
00:48:59,983 --> 00:49:02,622
You were right.
They went for the antenna array.

703
00:49:02,703 --> 00:49:06,252
- We're on schedule.
- Losing our team wasn't part of the plan.

704
00:49:11,303 --> 00:49:12,895
Attention, Dulles tower.

705
00:49:12,983 --> 00:49:14,621
Attention, Dulles control tower.

706
00:49:14,703 --> 00:49:17,661
Mr Trudeau, I knowyou're listening.

707
00:49:17,743 --> 00:49:21,338
- Unfortunately, you're not obeying.
- Try me face to face.

708
00:49:21,423 --> 00:49:23,254
You were warned
not to restore your systems.

709
00:49:23,343 --> 00:49:26,972
You've wasted lives andprecious time
on a futile and obvious target.

710
00:49:27,063 --> 00:49:29,702
Now you're going to pay the penalty.

711
00:49:29,783 --> 00:49:31,899
I've got five dead officers, Colonel Stuart.

712
00:49:31,983 --> 00:49:33,655
Isn't thatpenalty enough?

713
00:49:33,743 --> 00:49:36,416
McClane, keep out of this.
You've been a pain...

714
00:49:38,223 --> 00:49:39,861
(Stuart) Oh, McClane.

715
00:49:39,943 --> 00:49:41,979
John McClane.

716
00:49:42,983 --> 00:49:47,056
The policeman hero who saved
the Nakatomi hostages.

717
00:49:47,143 --> 00:49:48,895
I read aboutyou in People magazine.

718
00:49:48,983 --> 00:49:51,133
You seemed out ofyour league on Nightline.

719
00:49:51,223 --> 00:49:52,622
Hey, Colonel, blow me.

720
00:49:52,703 --> 00:49:56,378
How much drug money is Esperanza
paying you to turn traitor?

721
00:49:56,463 --> 00:50:00,172
Cardinal Richelieu said it best:
"Treason is merely a matter of dates".

722
00:50:00,263 --> 00:50:04,142
This country's got to learn
it can't keep cutting the legs off...

723
00:50:04,223 --> 00:50:06,418
..of men like General Esperanza.

724
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:09,813
Men who have the guts to stand up
against communist aggression.

725
00:50:09,903 --> 00:50:12,895
And lesson one starts
with killing policemen?

726
00:50:12,983 --> 00:50:15,451
What's lesson two, the neutron bomb?

727
00:50:16,463 --> 00:50:19,341
No. I think we can find
something in between.

728
00:50:21,783 --> 00:50:23,102
Watch this.

729
00:50:24,303 --> 00:50:27,420
Give me a flight number.
One that's low on fuel.

730
00:50:28,303 --> 00:50:30,339
Windsor 114.
Transatlantic from London.

731
00:50:30,423 --> 00:50:32,015
Fuel tank's dry as a martini.

732
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:37,336
Activate the ILS landing system,
but recalibrate sea level...

733
00:50:38,863 --> 00:50:40,854
..minus 200 feet.

734
00:51:03,903 --> 00:51:07,691
Oh, Jesus! They've reset
ground level, minus 200 feet.

735
00:51:08,663 --> 00:51:10,176
(Stuart) Windsor flight 114.

736
00:51:10,263 --> 00:51:11,412
This is Dulles approach.

737
00:51:11,503 --> 00:51:13,175
Do you copy?

738
00:51:13,263 --> 00:51:15,652
Dulles approach, this is Windsor 114.

739
00:51:15,743 --> 00:51:18,815
- Where the devil have you been?
- Windsor 114.

740
00:51:18,903 --> 00:51:21,701
We've been right here all along, old buddy.

741
00:51:21,783 --> 00:51:24,217
Our systems have onlyjust
came back on line.

742
00:51:25,023 --> 00:51:28,333
Windsor 114,
you are cleared for ILS approach,...

743
00:51:28,423 --> 00:51:29,822
..runway two-niner.

744
00:51:29,903 --> 00:51:32,656
Contact Dulles tower frequency
at the outer marker.

745
00:51:32,743 --> 00:51:34,938
Jesus Christ,
he's gonna crash the plane!

746
00:51:35,023 --> 00:51:36,536
Roger, approach, and about time.

747
00:51:36,623 --> 00:51:39,581
I've got 230 people up here
flying on petrol fumes.

748
00:51:39,663 --> 00:51:41,062
Roger, 114. Understand.

749
00:51:41,143 --> 00:51:43,577
- Calibrate Dulles altimeter...
- Oh, Jesus.

750
00:51:43,663 --> 00:51:45,574
They'll fly right into the concrete.

751
00:51:45,663 --> 00:51:47,062
Son of a bitch!

752
00:51:47,143 --> 00:51:49,054
Why are they listening to him?

753
00:51:49,143 --> 00:51:51,941
- It's our frequency!
- Dulles, this is Windsor 114.

754
00:51:52,863 --> 00:51:53,852
Barnes!

755
00:51:53,943 --> 00:51:57,253
This is Dulles tower.
We have radar contact...

756
00:51:57,343 --> 00:52:00,016
- Give me your coat!
- Windsor 114, stand by...

757
00:52:00,103 --> 00:52:02,094
What are you going to do?

758
00:52:02,183 --> 00:52:03,741
Whatever I can.

759
00:52:06,343 --> 00:52:10,461
Ladies and gentlemen,
we've started our descent.

760
00:52:10,543 --> 00:52:12,420
We're sorry for the inconvenience,...

761
00:52:12,503 --> 00:52:15,256
..but we'll all be on the ground shortly.
Thank you.

762
00:52:15,343 --> 00:52:17,220
Please keep your seat belts on.

763
00:52:17,303 --> 00:52:20,056
We've made arrangements
for your next flight,...

764
00:52:20,143 --> 00:52:22,020
..so you won't miss it, OK?

765
00:52:22,103 --> 00:52:24,981
In your seat, please.
Come on, in your seat.

766
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:28,702
Oh, hey.
We're just like British Rail, love.

767
00:52:28,783 --> 00:52:31,092
We may be late, but we get you there.

768
00:52:31,183 --> 00:52:32,741
Don't worry.

769
00:52:47,983 --> 00:52:49,496
Good luck, McClane!

770
00:53:09,783 --> 00:53:11,899
(beeping)

771
00:53:11,983 --> 00:53:16,056
Dulles, this is Windsor 114
inside the outer marker.

772
00:53:16,143 --> 00:53:18,611
Roger, 114. This is Dulles tower.

773
00:53:18,703 --> 00:53:21,012
We have radar contact
and show you on ILS.

774
00:53:21,103 --> 00:53:23,571
You're in the glide path
and looking good.

775
00:53:32,463 --> 00:53:34,454
There's somebody out there!

776
00:53:38,223 --> 00:53:39,781
It's McClane.

777
00:53:39,863 --> 00:53:41,660
Christ.

778
00:53:45,743 --> 00:53:46,937
Approach flaps.

779
00:53:47,383 --> 00:53:48,736
Approach flaps.

780
00:53:48,823 --> 00:53:52,702
- Approach speed 140.
- Approach speed 140.

781
00:53:52,783 --> 00:53:54,262
- 130.
- 130.

782
00:53:54,343 --> 00:53:56,413
Altitude 1,000 feet.

783
00:53:56,503 --> 00:53:58,653
800, guys! You're only at 800 feet!

784
00:53:58,743 --> 00:54:01,894
(radio) Fire and rescue.
Roll everything onto runway two-niner!

785
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:04,417
(aircraft captain) Refspeedplus 20.

786
00:54:04,503 --> 00:54:06,300
600 feet.

787
00:54:06,383 --> 00:54:08,897
Looking good, Windsor.

788
00:54:08,983 --> 00:54:10,462
Now, watch it.

789
00:54:10,543 --> 00:54:13,341
30-knot crosswinds,
and the runway is icy.

790
00:54:13,423 --> 00:54:15,334
Attaboy. We've got you.

791
00:54:16,303 --> 00:54:17,782
We've got you.

792
00:54:30,343 --> 00:54:31,492
Pull it up!

793
00:54:32,543 --> 00:54:33,259
Jesus!

794
00:54:46,503 --> 00:54:49,779
- Aagh! We're going to die!
- We've got you.

795
00:55:15,423 --> 00:55:16,981
God.

796
00:55:21,103 --> 00:55:23,094
Motherfucker.

797
00:55:26,023 --> 00:55:27,422
Motherfucker.

798
00:55:30,583 --> 00:55:32,380
(man) Oh, Jesus.

799
00:55:43,303 --> 00:55:46,534
That concludes our object lesson
for this evening.

800
00:55:46,623 --> 00:55:48,898
If the 747 we requested
is ready on time...

801
00:55:48,983 --> 00:55:52,214
..and General Esperanza's plane
arrives unmolested,...

802
00:55:52,303 --> 00:55:54,214
..further lessons can be avoided.

803
00:55:54,303 --> 00:55:55,292
Out.

804
00:56:00,503 --> 00:56:01,982
(woman crying)

805
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:08,373
(sirens)

806
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:29,621
(yelling)

807
00:56:39,743 --> 00:56:42,211
We got no sign of survivors down here.

808
00:56:42,303 --> 00:56:43,861
It's a goddamn nightmare.

809
00:56:45,703 --> 00:56:47,933
Hey, Nelson! Come here.

810
00:56:57,703 --> 00:56:58,692
Barnes!

811
00:56:59,783 --> 00:57:03,617
We've got to warn those planes
there's a lunatic pretending he's the tower.

812
00:57:03,703 --> 00:57:05,978
- Get me on the air.
- How?

813
00:57:06,063 --> 00:57:07,337
You figure it out!

814
00:57:07,423 --> 00:57:08,856
Here's the manifest.

815
00:57:28,783 --> 00:57:31,775
McClane, I know how you must feel.

816
00:57:35,623 --> 00:57:38,581
I wanted to help those people.

817
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:41,416
I was pretty goddamn useless.

818
00:57:46,103 --> 00:57:48,412
We called the government for help.

819
00:57:48,503 --> 00:57:52,212
They're going to send in
a Special army unit.

820
00:57:52,303 --> 00:57:54,294
A counterterrorist team.

821
00:58:00,863 --> 00:58:03,536
Your wife's plane...

822
00:58:03,623 --> 00:58:07,901
They're still broadcasting,
even though we can't answer.

823
00:58:08,903 --> 00:58:11,895
They're going to run
out of fuel in 90 minutes.

824
00:58:23,503 --> 00:58:26,176
Listen, Dick. That is your name(?)

825
00:58:26,263 --> 00:58:27,821
Dick.

826
00:58:27,903 --> 00:58:30,622
If you're going
to continue to get this close,...

827
00:58:30,703 --> 00:58:32,580
..could you switch aftershaves?

828
00:58:33,943 --> 00:58:35,740
Anything else?

829
00:58:35,823 --> 00:58:38,735
Stronger mouthwash might be nice.

830
00:58:38,823 --> 00:58:42,133
(TV) And here's Sam Coleman
reporting live from the accident.

831
00:58:42,223 --> 00:58:45,215
Colonel, they've done
everything we've anticipated...

832
00:58:45,303 --> 00:58:47,021
..so far.

833
00:58:47,103 --> 00:58:48,661
(TV)
But still there has been no offiicial word.

834
00:58:48,743 --> 00:58:53,055
Despite the fact that only one runway
has been closed due to the tragedy,...

835
00:58:53,143 --> 00:58:57,341
..several dozen airliners are visible,
endlessly circling the fiield.

836
00:58:57,423 --> 00:59:01,496
Other reports say there was trouble
in the tower before the crash...

837
00:59:01,583 --> 00:59:04,222
..and that that may have contributed to it.

838
00:59:04,303 --> 00:59:06,453
With weather conditions worsening,...

839
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:08,932
..the problem here
and in the sky will grow.

840
00:59:09,023 --> 00:59:12,299
I'm Samantha Coleman
at Dulles lnternationaIAirport.

841
00:59:18,663 --> 00:59:19,982
Victor. Victor.

842
00:59:20,063 --> 00:59:22,497
- Victor.
- Yeah, what's up?

843
00:59:22,583 --> 00:59:25,336
Did you pack the radio mikes
from the shoot or are they here?

844
00:59:25,423 --> 00:59:27,334
I wouldn't let those assholes
check them in!

845
00:59:27,423 --> 00:59:28,572
I love you.

846
00:59:28,663 --> 00:59:30,699
Give me one of the receivers.

847
00:59:35,023 --> 00:59:38,299
Can you tune into
the cockpit frequency?

848
00:59:38,383 --> 00:59:41,295
- Yeah. Why?
- I want to hear what's going on.

849
00:59:42,983 --> 00:59:45,338
Should be right here on our band.

850
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:47,292
Nothing.

851
00:59:47,383 --> 00:59:49,294
You said it would work.
Is it working or not ?

852
00:59:49,383 --> 00:59:53,456
It is working, but all I'm getting
is some kind of airport beacon.

853
00:59:53,543 --> 00:59:56,421
It's weird. It's like the tower isn't there.

854
00:59:59,263 --> 01:00:01,015
Stay on it.

855
01:00:01,103 --> 01:00:03,776
Let me know when
there is something there.

856
01:00:04,343 --> 01:00:05,981
OK.

857
01:00:41,663 --> 01:00:43,221
Major Grant. We're Blue Light.

858
01:00:43,303 --> 01:00:45,021
Rollins, Department Of Justice.

859
01:00:45,103 --> 01:00:46,980
Trudeau, Chief Of Air Operations.

860
01:00:47,063 --> 01:00:48,621
Lorenzo, Terminal Police.

861
01:00:48,703 --> 01:00:50,534
You want something, you got it.

862
01:00:50,623 --> 01:00:53,535
This is it? One fucking platoon?

863
01:00:53,623 --> 01:00:55,898
One crisis, one platoon. Who are you?

864
01:00:55,983 --> 01:00:57,018
John McClane.

865
01:00:57,103 --> 01:00:59,822
McClane, you showed
some balls out there, man.

866
01:00:59,903 --> 01:01:01,416
Yeah.

867
01:01:01,503 --> 01:01:04,813
Now show some good sense.
Let the pros handle this.

868
01:01:04,903 --> 01:01:07,371
I think the pros
are on the wrong team tonight.

869
01:01:07,463 --> 01:01:09,260
Isn't Colonel Stuart one of your men?

870
01:01:09,343 --> 01:01:10,742
No, not anymore, he's not.

871
01:01:10,823 --> 01:01:12,939
We're here to take Colonel Stuart down.

872
01:01:13,023 --> 01:01:15,173
And we will take him down.

873
01:01:15,263 --> 01:01:18,335
I served with him.
I taught him everything he knows.

874
01:01:18,423 --> 01:01:22,098
Well, maybe he's learned
a few more things since then.

875
01:01:23,143 --> 01:01:24,462
Let's hustle!

876
01:01:24,543 --> 01:01:27,660
The command post will be set up
in the airport police station.

877
01:01:27,743 --> 01:01:30,655
I want to be tied into the tower
in 15 minutes.

878
01:01:30,743 --> 01:01:32,381
All right, let's do it!

879
01:01:34,183 --> 01:01:35,536
Hey, Trudeau.

880
01:01:37,103 --> 01:01:39,333
Did things just get better or worse?

881
01:01:43,463 --> 01:01:45,374
Lights. Big, portable lights.

882
01:01:45,463 --> 01:01:47,419
We set up the field, and then we...

883
01:01:47,503 --> 01:01:49,539
Wait for those lunatics
to shoot them out?

884
01:01:49,623 --> 01:01:51,022
Where do we get those lights?

885
01:01:51,103 --> 01:01:52,536
What about the air phone idea?

886
01:01:52,623 --> 01:01:56,252
There's 18 planes up there.
Only five of them have those phones.

887
01:01:56,343 --> 01:01:58,618
We got through to three.
We're trying the others.

888
01:01:58,703 --> 01:02:00,295
That's 13 potential accidents.

889
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:02,294
Are they still bucking headwinds?

890
01:02:02,383 --> 01:02:04,374
Headwinds are slamming
everybody over the outer marker.

891
01:02:04,463 --> 01:02:05,816
The planes with enough fuel...

892
01:02:05,903 --> 01:02:08,576
..have been shunted
to Atlanta, Memphis and Nashville.

893
01:02:08,663 --> 01:02:10,699
Outer marker.

894
01:02:10,783 --> 01:02:11,693
Damn!

895
01:02:12,583 --> 01:02:14,539
The outer marker!

896
01:02:14,623 --> 01:02:17,421
It's a beacon, right?
It sends out this beep beep beep...

897
01:02:17,503 --> 01:02:19,095
..so they know they're over it.

898
01:02:19,183 --> 01:02:22,414
- So?
- Who says that signal has to beep?

899
01:02:22,503 --> 01:02:25,381
We switch the frequency from
the tower to the one in the beacon.

900
01:02:25,463 --> 01:02:26,942
We pump up the wattage.

901
01:02:27,023 --> 01:02:30,015
We can talk to our planes, and
those bastards who did this won't know!

902
01:02:33,463 --> 01:02:36,102
Traced the signal.
Found it in the luggage area.

903
01:02:36,183 --> 01:02:39,175
They've been tapped into
your tower chatter all night.

904
01:02:39,263 --> 01:02:41,697
Punks stealing luggage, huh, Carmine?

905
01:02:44,783 --> 01:02:47,695
- How you doing, Telford?
- No good. I called Lang.

906
01:02:47,783 --> 01:02:50,343
They'll have a portable decoder
here in two hours.

907
01:02:50,423 --> 01:02:52,300
My wife doesn't have two hours.

908
01:02:52,383 --> 01:02:54,374
I was put on Grant's team yesterday.

909
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:56,340
The regular guy got appendicitis.

910
01:02:56,423 --> 01:02:59,142
Word is, nobody's better
at this than Major Grant.

911
01:02:59,223 --> 01:03:00,417
Attention!

912
01:03:00,503 --> 01:03:02,494
Except maybe Colonel Stuart.

913
01:03:04,023 --> 01:03:07,140
I want to hear about
the plane those bastards asked for.

914
01:03:07,223 --> 01:03:10,852
Then I'll fill you in on my orders.
Pilots' Briefing Room. Now!

915
01:03:11,023 --> 01:03:11,899
Keep working.

916
01:03:11,983 --> 01:03:13,211
Albertson. With me.

917
01:03:17,703 --> 01:03:19,694
No civilians.

918
01:03:30,121 --> 01:03:32,760
- What the fuck... ?
- What is it?

919
01:03:33,761 --> 01:03:37,470
The outer marker beeper.
It isn't beeping. It's talking.

920
01:03:37,561 --> 01:03:40,837
(radio) Attention,
all aircraft in Dulles landing pattern.

921
01:03:40,921 --> 01:03:43,037
This is ChiefEngineer, Leslie Barnes.

922
01:03:43,121 --> 01:03:46,318
I have been authorised
to brief you in full.

923
01:03:46,401 --> 01:03:50,474
At this time, this is the only
channel available to us.

924
01:03:50,561 --> 01:03:52,677
Here is the situation.

925
01:03:52,761 --> 01:03:54,752
Approximately two hours ago...

926
01:03:57,761 --> 01:03:59,114
Get a load of this.

927
01:03:59,201 --> 01:04:02,034
Do not accept instructions
claiming to be from our tower...

928
01:04:02,121 --> 01:04:04,681
..unless you hear
your flight recorder access code.

929
01:04:04,761 --> 01:04:06,752
- The terrorists have got all...
- Holy shit!

930
01:04:06,841 --> 01:04:08,877
- ..our systems and...
- Get this on tape!

931
01:04:08,961 --> 01:04:10,917
..have control ofeverything
except this channel.

932
01:04:11,001 --> 01:04:12,195
Give us a second here, please.

933
01:04:12,281 --> 01:04:15,671
This channel is secure.
Your own transmissions are not.

934
01:04:15,761 --> 01:04:19,640
Do not attempt to reply on your
own frequencies to this broadcast.

935
01:04:19,721 --> 01:04:22,030
These people have already
caused one crash...

936
01:04:22,121 --> 01:04:24,237
- ..by impersonating our tower.
- Jesus.

937
01:04:34,801 --> 01:04:37,076
Repeat. The terrorists have cut off...

938
01:04:37,161 --> 01:04:39,231
..the two systems that allowyou to land:

939
01:04:39,321 --> 01:04:43,519
fiield lights for a visual landing
and the ILS for an instrument.

940
01:04:43,601 --> 01:04:47,310
A Special US Army unit is here,
preparing to take out the terrorists.

941
01:04:47,401 --> 01:04:49,790
- My God.
- Don't accept any instructions...

942
01:04:49,881 --> 01:04:52,839
- Yo, Marvin.
- Hey, you interested in a nice coat?

943
01:04:52,921 --> 01:04:55,151
No. It never looked good on me anyway.

944
01:04:55,241 --> 01:04:57,880
You've got to get me
to the Pilots' Briefing Room.

945
01:04:57,961 --> 01:04:59,917
I've got to hear what they're saying.

946
01:05:00,001 --> 01:05:03,311
- Which map gets me in there?
- Don't touch it! Don't touch it!

947
01:05:03,401 --> 01:05:04,959
- Find the map, Marvin.
- I'll find it.

948
01:05:05,041 --> 01:05:07,077
You'll mess up my whole
damn filing system.

949
01:05:07,161 --> 01:05:10,119
Pilots' Briefing Room,
I think that's in the main terminal.

950
01:05:10,201 --> 01:05:13,716
So would that be under P
for Pilots' Briefing Room?

951
01:05:13,801 --> 01:05:17,635
- Now, Marvin!
- Or maybe under Mfor Miscellaneous.

952
01:05:21,121 --> 01:05:22,759
- (beeping)
- Oh, shit!

953
01:05:22,841 --> 01:05:26,277
(radio) Requestpermission
to reduce sentry duty to 30-minute rotation.

954
01:05:26,361 --> 01:05:28,511
My men are getting cold and antsy.
Over.

955
01:05:28,601 --> 01:05:33,117
This is Colonel Stuart. Assemble
the men not on watch for a briefiing.

956
01:05:33,201 --> 01:05:34,316
- Roger.
- What's the matter?

957
01:05:34,401 --> 01:05:36,039
Oh!

958
01:05:37,041 --> 01:05:38,679
Gentlemen,...

959
01:05:39,841 --> 01:05:41,832
..tonight the pattern ends.

960
01:05:41,921 --> 01:05:44,230
The dominoes will fall no more,...

961
01:05:44,321 --> 01:05:46,437
..and the ramparts will remain upright.

962
01:05:46,521 --> 01:05:49,240
Sir, General Esperanza's plane
is on the scope.

963
01:05:55,881 --> 01:05:57,439
Attention, Dulles tower.

964
01:05:57,881 --> 01:05:59,633
We will be lighting up a runway.

965
01:05:59,721 --> 01:06:03,111
Do not, repeat,
do not attempt to land anyplanes.

966
01:06:03,201 --> 01:06:06,034
Remember, we're monitoring you.

967
01:06:08,761 --> 01:06:10,513
What do we do?

968
01:06:10,961 --> 01:06:12,360
Obey.

969
01:06:18,201 --> 01:06:20,476
Dulles tower to FoxtrotMichael One.

970
01:06:20,561 --> 01:06:21,630
Dulles tower...

971
01:06:21,721 --> 01:06:23,393
..to Foxtrot Michael One.

972
01:06:23,481 --> 01:06:26,678
This is Foxtrot Michael One, Dulles.
We read you. Over.

973
01:06:26,761 --> 01:06:29,036
Foxtrot Michael One,
you are to come in on runway...

974
01:06:29,121 --> 01:06:32,431
..1-5, repeat, 1-5.

975
01:06:45,721 --> 01:06:49,634
I found it on the floor,
by the coat, next to the luggage belt.

976
01:06:49,721 --> 01:06:51,359
What the hell you so excited for?

977
01:06:51,441 --> 01:06:53,477
The code's still punched into this one.

978
01:06:53,561 --> 01:06:54,960
You like it, huh?

979
01:06:55,041 --> 01:06:56,997
How about giving me 20 bucks for it?

980
01:06:57,081 --> 01:06:59,231
How about I let you live?

981
01:07:01,121 --> 01:07:02,713
The man knows how to bargain.

982
01:07:02,801 --> 01:07:05,156
This is contrary to our instructions.

983
01:07:05,241 --> 01:07:07,914
We are to land at runway 1-0,...

984
01:07:08,001 --> 01:07:11,198
..where we are to be met
by representatives of your Justice...

985
01:07:12,281 --> 01:07:16,035
Captain, please tell the tower
you will proceed as ordered.

986
01:07:26,681 --> 01:07:28,831
Roger, Dulles.

987
01:07:28,921 --> 01:07:31,310
Proceeding to runway 1-5.

988
01:07:31,401 --> 01:07:33,596
(yelling)

989
01:07:38,561 --> 01:07:39,516
(gunshots)

990
01:07:46,561 --> 01:07:48,631
Foxtrot Michael One. Come in, please.

991
01:07:50,121 --> 01:07:52,874
What are you going to do now?
Are you going to shoot me?

992
01:07:52,961 --> 01:07:54,280
So who will fly the plane?

993
01:07:54,361 --> 01:07:57,558
Don't worry about it.
It's not your problem.

994
01:07:58,521 --> 01:08:00,512
(plane descending)

995
01:08:03,881 --> 01:08:05,394
Michael One. Do you copy?

996
01:08:09,161 --> 01:08:11,595
Foxtrot Michael One. Come in, please.

997
01:08:16,321 --> 01:08:17,356
(beep)

998
01:08:18,681 --> 01:08:19,875
(beeping)

999
01:08:19,961 --> 01:08:21,314
Eagle Nest.

1000
01:08:21,401 --> 01:08:23,119
This is Falcon. Mayday.

1001
01:08:23,201 --> 01:08:26,159
Eagle Nest. This is Falcon. Mayday!

1002
01:08:27,761 --> 01:08:29,399
Go ahead, Falcon.

1003
01:08:29,481 --> 01:08:32,439
I've lost cabin pressure.
Near-zero visibility.

1004
01:08:32,521 --> 01:08:35,274
I must drop out
of this weather and land now,...

1005
01:08:35,361 --> 01:08:37,238
..on the fiirst accessible runway.

1006
01:08:37,321 --> 01:08:38,549
Repeat.

1007
01:08:38,641 --> 01:08:41,439
I've lost cabin pressure.
Near-zero visibility.

1008
01:08:41,521 --> 01:08:43,432
I must drop out ofthe storm.

1009
01:08:43,521 --> 01:08:47,719
I can land, butl must land now,
on the fiirst outgoing runway.

1010
01:08:47,801 --> 01:08:51,476
Repeat.
I cannot circle around to runway 1-5.

1011
01:08:55,121 --> 01:08:56,713
I'll make you a deal, Marvin.

1012
01:08:56,801 --> 01:08:58,598
Show me a shortcut to those runways,...

1013
01:08:58,681 --> 01:09:00,478
..and I'll get you a liner for that coat.

1014
01:09:00,561 --> 01:09:03,633
Repeat. I cannot circle
around to runway 1-5.

1015
01:09:03,721 --> 01:09:05,916
(Shit.) Stand by, Falcon.

1016
01:09:08,081 --> 01:09:10,390
Here, sir.
He's coming in from the ocean.

1017
01:09:11,601 --> 01:09:14,911
(Esperanza)
A bullet has damaged my instruments.

1018
01:09:15,001 --> 01:09:16,878
I'm not sure ofmy bearings,...

1019
01:09:16,961 --> 01:09:19,156
..and I must make
a visual landing immediately.

1020
01:09:19,241 --> 01:09:21,960
- Do you copy, Eagle Nest?
- Roger, Falcon.

1021
01:09:22,041 --> 01:09:23,793
(radio) That would be 2-5 right.

1022
01:09:23,881 --> 01:09:26,031
Repeat. 2-5 right.

1023
01:09:26,121 --> 01:09:29,238
Make up your fucking mind!

1024
01:09:29,321 --> 01:09:32,040
We are just up to our ass
in terrorists again, John.

1025
01:09:32,121 --> 01:09:34,112
Affiirmative. 2-5 right. Over.

1026
01:09:34,361 --> 01:09:35,840
2-5 right.

1027
01:09:37,401 --> 01:09:39,517
I've got to quit smoking cigarettes.

1028
01:09:39,601 --> 01:09:41,796
(Esperanza)
Thank you for telling me, Eagle Nest.

1029
01:09:41,881 --> 01:09:44,031
But if you could show it to me as well,...

1030
01:09:44,121 --> 01:09:45,839
..l would be grateful.

1031
01:09:56,001 --> 01:09:59,516
I see the lights.
They are directly in front ofme.

1032
01:09:59,601 --> 01:10:01,034
Gracias, compadre.

1033
01:10:01,121 --> 01:10:03,919
Reducing air speed.
Approaching runway.

1034
01:10:04,001 --> 01:10:06,959
- Wish me luck.
- Roger, Falcon.

1035
01:10:08,001 --> 01:10:10,276
We copy.
We'll have you in five minutes.

1036
01:10:10,361 --> 01:10:13,512
That's right, asshole.
We'll have you in five minutes.

1037
01:10:36,161 --> 01:10:38,038
(Stuart) I see your lights.

1038
01:10:38,121 --> 01:10:39,918
ETA 90 seconds.

1039
01:10:48,161 --> 01:10:50,470
Come to papa, scumbag.

1040
01:11:28,841 --> 01:11:30,911
(groans)

1041
01:11:43,441 --> 01:11:44,669
Oh, shit!

1042
01:11:55,081 --> 01:11:56,480
No!

1043
01:12:42,361 --> 01:12:43,589
Freedom.

1044
01:12:45,241 --> 01:12:46,469
Not yet.

1045
01:12:47,321 --> 01:12:48,231
(cocks gun)

1046
01:12:48,321 --> 01:12:51,836
You should stay in your seat
until the plane reaches the terminal.

1047
01:12:51,921 --> 01:12:53,798
No frequent-flier mileage for you.

1048
01:12:53,881 --> 01:12:56,076
- Who are you?
- A cop.

1049
01:12:56,161 --> 01:12:57,913
- A cop?
- Yeah, one of the good guys.

1050
01:12:58,001 --> 01:12:59,320
You're one of the bad guys.

1051
01:12:59,401 --> 01:13:02,438
Now I've got your sorry ass,
I'm going to trade it for my wife.

1052
01:13:02,521 --> 01:13:03,590
(gunfiire)

1053
01:13:11,441 --> 01:13:12,430
Sit down!

1054
01:13:15,681 --> 01:13:17,592
Go in!

1055
01:13:23,161 --> 01:13:24,913
- Where did he go?
- In there.

1056
01:13:33,801 --> 01:13:35,314
(Esperanza) I don't believe this.

1057
01:13:35,401 --> 01:13:37,517
Two months of planning,...

1058
01:13:37,601 --> 01:13:39,432
..and you can't anticipate
one pendejo of a cop.

1059
01:13:39,521 --> 01:13:41,591
- Come on, General.
- Where is Colonel Stuart?

1060
01:13:45,601 --> 01:13:47,557
- General!
- I'm all right.

1061
01:13:47,641 --> 01:13:51,520
He said he was a policeman.
I thought you had this place secured.

1062
01:13:51,601 --> 01:13:54,718
- He went in the cockpit.
- He's going to hell!

1063
01:13:55,641 --> 01:13:56,630
McClane!

1064
01:13:56,721 --> 01:13:59,758
I assume it's you, McClane.

1065
01:14:00,601 --> 01:14:02,432
You're quite a little soldier.

1066
01:14:03,001 --> 01:14:06,710
You can consider this a military funeral!

1067
01:14:21,841 --> 01:14:23,832
Aaagh!

1068
01:14:30,001 --> 01:14:32,469
- How many grenades we got?
- Three each!

1069
01:14:33,201 --> 01:14:34,395
Use them!

1070
01:14:44,481 --> 01:14:46,039
Oh, fuck.

1071
01:14:59,561 --> 01:15:01,074
Go!

1072
01:15:13,601 --> 01:15:17,196
Aaagh!

1073
01:15:17,281 --> 01:15:18,600
Oh, shit!

1074
01:15:27,001 --> 01:15:28,639
You lucky fuck.

1075
01:15:30,761 --> 01:15:32,080
(sirens)

1076
01:15:32,161 --> 01:15:33,310
Fire trucks, sir.

1077
01:15:33,401 --> 01:15:35,710
Fall back to the church. Now!

1078
01:15:57,281 --> 01:15:59,317
Where's the fucking door?

1079
01:16:03,281 --> 01:16:04,191
(beep)

1080
01:16:12,201 --> 01:16:15,034
They're getting a little
nervous back there.

1081
01:16:15,121 --> 01:16:16,474
In fact, so am l.

1082
01:16:16,561 --> 01:16:17,789
We're over Washington.

1083
01:16:17,881 --> 01:16:20,111
See if you can get any TV
to settle them down.

1084
01:16:20,201 --> 01:16:22,954
Works for me. I'll...

1085
01:16:23,041 --> 01:16:24,952
(beeping)

1086
01:16:45,201 --> 01:16:48,477
Writing your acceptance speech
for the video sleaze awards?

1087
01:16:48,561 --> 01:16:51,394
- Try Pulitzer.
- (PA) Ladies and gentlemen,...

1088
01:16:51,481 --> 01:16:54,518
..while waiting to land, we are
turning on local Washington TV.

1089
01:16:54,601 --> 01:16:56,432
The sound is on channel three.

1090
01:17:03,401 --> 01:17:04,720
OK.

1091
01:17:05,041 --> 01:17:06,076
OK, OK.

1092
01:17:14,161 --> 01:17:16,470
Please, sir, we may land at any moment.

1093
01:17:16,561 --> 01:17:19,314
- If you'll take your seat...
- I'm going to be sick.

1094
01:17:19,401 --> 01:17:22,598
- I'm going to be sick.
- Sir, the seat belt light is on.

1095
01:17:26,441 --> 01:17:27,760
Moron.

1096
01:17:27,841 --> 01:17:29,832
- WZDC.
- This is Richard Thornberg.

1097
01:17:29,921 --> 01:17:31,639
Put me through to Ruben
in the newsroom.

1098
01:17:31,721 --> 01:17:35,236
- He's about to go live.
- I know he is. That's why I need him.

1099
01:17:35,321 --> 01:17:36,640
You'll have to hold on...

1100
01:17:36,721 --> 01:17:39,599
Put me through, Celia,
or start typing your resume.

1101
01:17:39,801 --> 01:17:42,190
Esperanza's down,...

1102
01:17:43,161 --> 01:17:44,276
..but he's hurt.

1103
01:17:44,361 --> 01:17:46,352
He took a round in his shoulder.

1104
01:17:46,441 --> 01:17:49,751
I got one more of their guys.
That's six they lost altogether.

1105
01:17:49,841 --> 01:17:52,674
If we knew how many they had
to start with, we could get excited,...

1106
01:17:52,761 --> 01:17:56,310
..but if they got 50 guys,
it's a little early to open the champagne!

1107
01:17:56,401 --> 01:17:59,996
We appreciate your effort, but we
don't need a loose cannon here!

1108
01:18:00,081 --> 01:18:03,517
What if they crash another plane
in retaliation for your stunt?

1109
01:18:03,601 --> 01:18:05,273
They can't do that now, right, Barnes?

1110
01:18:05,801 --> 01:18:08,474
Besides, if I grabbed Esperanza,
this would be over now.

1111
01:18:08,561 --> 01:18:11,121
Maybe they're more creative
than you think!

1112
01:18:11,201 --> 01:18:13,351
Well, at least I'm thinking, goddammit!

1113
01:18:13,441 --> 01:18:17,036
We're here to jerk off that cocksucker
until he tries to take off.

1114
01:18:17,121 --> 01:18:18,110
Period!

1115
01:18:18,241 --> 01:18:21,074
You're the wrong guy
in the wrong place at the wrong time!

1116
01:18:23,241 --> 01:18:24,833
The story of my life.

1117
01:18:25,921 --> 01:18:29,072
Major! Pentagon Situation Room, sir!

1118
01:18:29,161 --> 01:18:32,358
Pentagon. I'll take it in here.
Thank you, Telford.

1119
01:18:32,601 --> 01:18:35,115
You men come with me.

1120
01:18:37,121 --> 01:18:38,600
- McClane.
- Yeah, Barnes.

1121
01:18:38,681 --> 01:18:41,115
You said those guys
showed up right away?

1122
01:18:41,201 --> 01:18:44,113
- Yeah.
- That means they're on the field or close.

1123
01:18:44,201 --> 01:18:46,715
And I think I know where.

1124
01:18:46,801 --> 01:18:48,519
Let me show you something.

1125
01:18:50,841 --> 01:18:53,435
These are the old plans
with the longer runways.

1126
01:18:53,521 --> 01:18:54,636
That's 12 years ago.

1127
01:18:54,721 --> 01:18:57,281
Looks like they've modified the site,...

1128
01:18:57,361 --> 01:19:00,637
..moved Tra-Con phones, ILS,
all the underground stuff...

1129
01:19:00,721 --> 01:19:02,518
..so they could handle drainage.

1130
01:19:02,601 --> 01:19:03,795
If I'm right,...

1131
01:19:03,881 --> 01:19:06,395
..it would run along the airport property...

1132
01:19:06,481 --> 01:19:08,597
..and go right past this neighbourhood.

1133
01:19:11,961 --> 01:19:14,077
We should have landed two hours ago!

1134
01:19:14,161 --> 01:19:16,595
I understand, but if you just relax...

1135
01:19:16,681 --> 01:19:17,716
It's hopeless.

1136
01:19:18,961 --> 01:19:22,431
Somebody ought to get their ass
kicked for this mess.

1137
01:19:22,521 --> 01:19:26,514
Unfortunately, there isn't anyone
we can blame for the weather.

1138
01:19:26,601 --> 01:19:29,434
Oh, yeah?
What about that porker, Willard Scott?

1139
01:19:29,521 --> 01:19:31,318
I should have taken the bus.

1140
01:19:31,401 --> 01:19:34,234
At least they can pull over
for food and gas.

1141
01:19:34,321 --> 01:19:35,231
Excuse me.

1142
01:19:35,961 --> 01:19:37,076
Yes?

1143
01:19:37,161 --> 01:19:38,719
I was just wondering.

1144
01:19:38,801 --> 01:19:43,192
This flight originally was
supposed to be 5½½½ hours, right?

1145
01:19:43,281 --> 01:19:44,077
Mm-hmm.

1146
01:19:44,161 --> 01:19:46,721
Do we have enough fuel
to keep circling like this?

1147
01:19:46,801 --> 01:19:47,790
Oh, of course.

1148
01:19:47,881 --> 01:19:50,839
They anticipate little problems like this.

1149
01:20:06,921 --> 01:20:10,152
We looked at 12 fucking houses,
and we're nowhere.

1150
01:20:10,241 --> 01:20:12,960
This is our last possibility.

1151
01:20:13,041 --> 01:20:15,032
Over here there's an old church.

1152
01:20:15,121 --> 01:20:16,793
Let's go.

1153
01:20:20,921 --> 01:20:22,912
Wait.

1154
01:20:29,001 --> 01:20:31,515
There's the church over there.

1155
01:20:38,641 --> 01:20:40,438
Could be a sentry.

1156
01:20:40,521 --> 01:20:42,113
He could just be out for a walk.

1157
01:20:42,201 --> 01:20:44,590
Then why is he
going over his own footsteps?

1158
01:20:47,041 --> 01:20:48,235
Come on.

1159
01:20:50,441 --> 01:20:51,510
All right.

1160
01:20:51,601 --> 01:20:53,990
Stay here
and get ready to call the marines.

1161
01:20:54,081 --> 01:20:55,673
I thought they were the army.

1162
01:20:55,761 --> 01:20:57,672
Who gives a fuck? Just be ready.

1163
01:21:13,601 --> 01:21:15,876
- (beeping)
- Oh, shit.

1164
01:21:16,881 --> 01:21:18,030
(Not now.)

1165
01:21:31,561 --> 01:21:33,119
Lorenzo, it's Barnes.

1166
01:21:33,201 --> 01:21:35,715
Where the hell didyou go?
Where's McClane?

1167
01:21:35,801 --> 01:21:38,952
With me, at the Hidey Lake Church,
to the west of the airport.

1168
01:21:39,041 --> 01:21:42,113
Where? Goddammit!
You crazy idiot, why didn't...

1169
01:21:42,201 --> 01:21:43,873
This must be their operations base.

1170
01:21:43,961 --> 01:21:45,599
Shut up and getyour ass here!

1171
01:21:45,681 --> 01:21:47,672
Code red! Sitrep.

1172
01:21:47,761 --> 01:21:50,070
We got positive ID on Stuart's location.

1173
01:21:50,161 --> 01:21:51,719
- Let's move.
- Yo!

1174
01:22:01,521 --> 01:22:04,991
Our escape plane will be ready
within 30 minutes, General.

1175
01:22:07,121 --> 01:22:09,191
If there are no more surprises.

1176
01:22:10,481 --> 01:22:12,472
(sirens)

1177
01:22:23,641 --> 01:22:25,711
Gentlemen, we have a situation here.

1178
01:23:11,881 --> 01:23:14,236
Aagh!

1179
01:23:23,081 --> 01:23:24,036
Ugh!

1180
01:23:39,561 --> 01:23:40,550
(whistles)

1181
01:23:40,641 --> 01:23:41,835
Over here.

1182
01:23:53,521 --> 01:23:56,319
Jeez, McClane, you all right?
You want a medic?

1183
01:23:56,401 --> 01:23:59,438
What the hell you think you're doing,
playing John Wayne?

1184
01:23:59,521 --> 01:24:01,671
How would you like to spend
the night in a cell?

1185
01:24:01,761 --> 01:24:03,877
Lorenzo, shut the fuck up
and do something useful.

1186
01:24:03,961 --> 01:24:05,110
Go seal off the street.

1187
01:24:05,201 --> 01:24:07,192
Hey, you can't talk to me like that.

1188
01:24:07,281 --> 01:24:08,555
Oh, no, Carmine?

1189
01:24:08,641 --> 01:24:12,190
Sergeant, get this bureaucrat
out of Mr McClane's face now.

1190
01:24:12,281 --> 01:24:14,112
With pleasure, sir.

1191
01:24:16,321 --> 01:24:19,631
Major, the men are in position, sir.

1192
01:24:19,721 --> 01:24:21,518
Close up the back. Then we go in.

1193
01:24:21,601 --> 01:24:23,910
- Fire only on my order.
- Roger that, sir.

1194
01:24:24,001 --> 01:24:25,719
Guess I was wrong about you.

1195
01:24:25,801 --> 01:24:28,190
You're not such an asshole after all.

1196
01:24:28,281 --> 01:24:31,717
No, you were right.
I'm just your kind of asshole.

1197
01:24:37,001 --> 01:24:38,480
(beeping)

1198
01:24:40,321 --> 01:24:42,312
Garber, sitrep!

1199
01:24:42,401 --> 01:24:46,110
Army Special Forces on three sides,
closing in fast around the back!

1200
01:24:46,201 --> 01:24:48,795
- Another problem, Colonel?
- No problem, General.

1201
01:24:50,201 --> 01:24:52,556
Gentlemen, you know what to do.

1202
01:25:03,081 --> 01:25:05,037
- Down!
- Get down! Get down!

1203
01:25:11,601 --> 01:25:13,034
(beeping)

1204
01:25:27,721 --> 01:25:28,710
(beeping)

1205
01:25:32,001 --> 01:25:32,990
General,...

1206
01:25:33,721 --> 01:25:34,870
..it's time.

1207
01:25:36,121 --> 01:25:37,998
(power cuts off)

1208
01:25:38,081 --> 01:25:39,560
(beeping)

1209
01:25:42,041 --> 01:25:44,350
Come on, let's move it!

1210
01:25:57,721 --> 01:26:00,713
- They're pulling out... at the back!
- What?

1211
01:26:04,961 --> 01:26:06,838
(gunfiire)

1212
01:26:08,361 --> 01:26:09,191
Move it!

1213
01:26:19,241 --> 01:26:21,709
Albertson, take your men around the back.

1214
01:26:28,081 --> 01:26:30,037
Aagh!

1215
01:26:34,961 --> 01:26:36,110
Aagh!

1216
01:26:46,081 --> 01:26:48,641
This equipment could land our planes.

1217
01:26:48,721 --> 01:26:51,315
There are trip wires.
They could have booby-trapped...

1218
01:26:51,401 --> 01:26:53,278
- They did.
- Got one here, too.

1219
01:26:53,361 --> 01:26:55,591
Looks like C-4.
The motherfucker is armed.

1220
01:26:55,681 --> 01:26:57,592
Clear the area! Everybody, now!

1221
01:27:00,161 --> 01:27:02,550
They booby-trapped all the equipment.

1222
01:27:02,641 --> 01:27:03,994
Seal off the building!

1223
01:27:04,081 --> 01:27:05,434
Shit!

1224
01:27:05,521 --> 01:27:07,955
Post sentries. No civilians allowed.

1225
01:27:08,041 --> 01:27:10,714
Hey, where the fuck is McClane?

1226
01:27:57,521 --> 01:27:59,034
Miller, take him!

1227
01:28:00,841 --> 01:28:02,354
I'll cover you!

1228
01:28:36,681 --> 01:28:40,720
Aagh!

1229
01:28:47,281 --> 01:28:49,511
So much for the element of chance.

1230
01:28:50,601 --> 01:28:51,920
Let's move out.

1231
01:29:09,281 --> 01:29:12,830
I had the bastard in my sights.
I know I did.

1232
01:29:21,841 --> 01:29:23,672
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1233
01:29:28,521 --> 01:29:30,910
(Stuart)
Attention. Attention, Dulles tower.

1234
01:29:31,001 --> 01:29:33,754
This is Colonel Stuart.
Is ourplane prepared?

1235
01:29:33,841 --> 01:29:37,754
It is. It's in hangar 11.
It's the most remote building we've got.

1236
01:29:39,121 --> 01:29:40,713
We're on our way.

1237
01:29:40,801 --> 01:29:44,316
Have a ground crew there
to confiirm the condition ofthe plane.

1238
01:29:44,401 --> 01:29:46,995
Do you believe the balls
on this son of a bitch?

1239
01:29:47,081 --> 01:29:50,756
Colonel, you're quite capable
of confiirming ityourself.

1240
01:29:50,841 --> 01:29:53,913
Don't ask us to gift-wrap
potential hostages foryou.

1241
01:29:54,001 --> 01:29:55,354
Major Grant, isn't it?

1242
01:29:55,441 --> 01:29:56,874
Ifyou remember me, Colonel,...

1243
01:29:56,961 --> 01:29:59,350
..then you remember
I know the drill as well as you do.

1244
01:30:00,441 --> 01:30:02,397
Check out your own fucking plane.

1245
01:30:02,481 --> 01:30:06,394
We move out in five minutes.
Flak jackets for everybody.

1246
01:30:06,481 --> 01:30:10,235
Body armour for the assault team.
Night scopes for the snipers.

1247
01:30:10,321 --> 01:30:14,109
We will take them in the hangar,
and I will pull that detonator...

1248
01:30:14,201 --> 01:30:17,034
..out of Stuart's dead fucking hand myself.

1249
01:30:17,121 --> 01:30:20,113
Lorenzo, take all your men
back to the airport.

1250
01:30:20,201 --> 01:30:21,714
Seal off every exit,...

1251
01:30:21,801 --> 01:30:24,952
..in case they try to slip past us
to break out onto the ground.

1252
01:30:25,041 --> 01:30:26,474
You got it.

1253
01:30:28,521 --> 01:30:30,079
All right, here we go.

1254
01:30:31,361 --> 01:30:34,114
This is nuts!
Every station has people at the airport,...

1255
01:30:34,201 --> 01:30:36,192
..and no-one has heard
a whisper ofthis shit!

1256
01:30:36,281 --> 01:30:37,316
None of them is me.

1257
01:30:37,401 --> 01:30:39,232
You want proof, try this.

1258
01:30:39,321 --> 01:30:42,358
(Barnes) Repeat.
Terrorists have murdered civilians...

1259
01:30:42,441 --> 01:30:45,353
..and cut offthe two systems
that can allowyou to land.

1260
01:30:45,441 --> 01:30:48,990
A Special US Army unit is here,
preparing to take out the terrorists.

1261
01:30:49,081 --> 01:30:51,800
- Jesus Christ.
- I wantyou to go live now.

1262
01:30:51,881 --> 01:30:53,758
Get me in from the fiiles.
A publicity shot.

1263
01:30:53,841 --> 01:30:55,797
The maps, steal one from weather.

1264
01:30:55,881 --> 01:30:57,872
We're on it.
We're cutting in five minutes!

1265
01:30:57,961 --> 01:31:00,634
Tell the affiliates if they want in,
they got three minutes to shout.

1266
01:31:00,721 --> 01:31:02,313
Let's do this.

1267
01:31:03,081 --> 01:31:04,833
Network, here I come.

1268
01:31:07,761 --> 01:31:10,480
Telford,
what was your chicken-shit outfit doing...

1269
01:31:10,561 --> 01:31:12,119
..while we were taking Grenada?

1270
01:31:13,961 --> 01:31:15,235
Grenada.

1271
01:31:15,321 --> 01:31:18,836
Five minutes of fire fight,
five weeks of surfing.

1272
01:31:18,921 --> 01:31:20,957
I wish I was with you guys for that.

1273
01:31:21,041 --> 01:31:23,271
Yeah. Me, too, kid.

1274
01:31:23,841 --> 01:31:26,116
- Really, sir?
- Sure.

1275
01:31:26,481 --> 01:31:28,756
Then we wouldn't have to do this.

1276
01:31:41,321 --> 01:31:43,391
(beeping)

1277
01:31:43,481 --> 01:31:46,234
Eagle Nest, this is Hatchling.

1278
01:31:47,281 --> 01:31:49,920
On schedule... and in position.

1279
01:31:50,001 --> 01:31:52,196
Roger, Hatchling. We are secure here.

1280
01:31:52,281 --> 01:31:54,192
You have a green light.

1281
01:31:54,361 --> 01:31:56,750
I repeat, a green light.

1282
01:32:00,281 --> 01:32:02,272
(whistles)

1283
01:32:05,521 --> 01:32:07,000
Ugh!

1284
01:32:08,121 --> 01:32:10,430
Jesus, officer,
where did you come from,...

1285
01:32:10,521 --> 01:32:11,874
..Pearl Harbour?

1286
01:32:15,961 --> 01:32:19,158
All right, let's clear it out, please.

1287
01:32:20,161 --> 01:32:21,276
Stand by.

1288
01:32:22,041 --> 01:32:24,475
Five, four, three...

1289
01:32:24,561 --> 01:32:28,031
(TV) This is a special bulletin
from WZDC News.

1290
01:32:28,121 --> 01:32:31,557
There has been a plane crash at Dulles,
where other aircraft still circle,...

1291
01:32:31,641 --> 01:32:34,792
..with no explanation
from airport or FAA offiicials.

1292
01:32:34,881 --> 01:32:37,441
And now,
with an exclusive WZDC report,...

1293
01:32:37,521 --> 01:32:41,150
..here's Dick Thornberg reporting
from the skies over Washington.

1294
01:32:41,241 --> 01:32:45,553
(Thornberg) I'm one ofthe thousandpeople
who has been circling our capital...

1295
01:32:45,641 --> 01:32:50,112
..under the assumption that whatever
problem there was below was a normal one.

1296
01:32:50,201 --> 01:32:52,237
But the truth is far from normal.

1297
01:32:52,321 --> 01:32:54,277
The truth is terrifying.

1298
01:32:54,361 --> 01:32:57,433
Look out! Lady, look out!

1299
01:32:57,521 --> 01:32:58,351
Look out! Look out!

1300
01:32:58,441 --> 01:33:00,716
Look out! Look out!
Get out of the way!

1301
01:33:02,041 --> 01:33:04,794
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way, lady!

1302
01:33:04,881 --> 01:33:06,519
Go, go! Hey, hey, look out!

1303
01:33:06,601 --> 01:33:08,637
This is a recording of a conversation...

1304
01:33:08,721 --> 01:33:11,599
..between Dulles tower
and a captive aircraft overhead.

1305
01:33:14,721 --> 01:33:16,712
Get out of the way!

1306
01:33:17,401 --> 01:33:18,516
Lorenzo!

1307
01:33:18,601 --> 01:33:21,559
- Are you out of your fucking mind?
- Where's the Blue Light team?

1308
01:33:21,641 --> 01:33:24,599
- Stuart's rigged explosives to a remote.
- Where's Grant?

1309
01:33:24,681 --> 01:33:27,241
They're going to kill that son of a bitch
and get it from them!

1310
01:33:27,321 --> 01:33:29,471
No, they're going to take off
on that plane with him!

1311
01:33:29,561 --> 01:33:31,597
Get the fuck out of here!

1312
01:33:31,681 --> 01:33:34,070
When the army canned Stuart,
he loaded that unit with his men!

1313
01:33:34,161 --> 01:33:37,949
- Are you nuts? That fire fight...
- Sideshow to buy him some time.

1314
01:33:38,041 --> 01:33:41,113
McClane, you are completely
around the fucking bend.

1315
01:33:41,201 --> 01:33:42,634
You're under arrest, motherfucker.

1316
01:33:48,721 --> 01:33:51,519
These are the bullets
they used out there tonight!

1317
01:33:51,601 --> 01:33:53,319
Blanks!

1318
01:33:55,161 --> 01:33:57,629
Jesus Christ.

1319
01:34:04,321 --> 01:34:06,676
This is Chief Lorenzo.

1320
01:34:06,761 --> 01:34:10,151
I want every officer recalled
and in body armour and full weaponry...

1321
01:34:10,241 --> 01:34:12,072
..in the motor pool in five minutes.

1322
01:34:14,481 --> 01:34:16,870
It's time to kick ass.

1323
01:34:18,561 --> 01:34:20,836
Just like lwo Jima!

1324
01:34:20,921 --> 01:34:25,995
(Thornberg) We have learned that
the terrorists have control ofthe airport,...

1325
01:34:26,081 --> 01:34:29,039
..a fact that the authorities have repressed.

1326
01:34:29,121 --> 01:34:33,160
The terrorists promise more bloodshed
unless their demands are met.

1327
01:34:33,241 --> 01:34:37,280
Now that the Special army commandos
have arrived at the airport,...

1328
01:34:37,361 --> 01:34:41,115
..the likelihood of a full-scale battle
is dangerously close.

1329
01:35:01,401 --> 01:35:03,710
That stupid, arrogant son of a bitch.

1330
01:35:03,801 --> 01:35:06,315
It's all over the airport.

1331
01:35:06,401 --> 01:35:08,437
(TV) 300 people have died...

1332
01:35:08,521 --> 01:35:10,830
When are we going to land?

1333
01:35:10,921 --> 01:35:13,310
..and unfortunately,
they may not be the last.

1334
01:35:13,401 --> 01:35:16,632
The horrifying fact is that no-one is safe,...

1335
01:35:16,721 --> 01:35:20,509
..either in the planes above Dulles
or in the terminal below.

1336
01:35:20,601 --> 01:35:23,877
The threat ofa new and higher
body count at the airport...

1337
01:35:23,961 --> 01:35:26,156
..hangs over the heads ofeveryone,...

1338
01:35:26,241 --> 01:35:29,995
..and the holiday season
ofpeace and love has become a nightmare.

1339
01:35:35,601 --> 01:35:37,239
All right, listen up!

1340
01:35:37,321 --> 01:35:40,233
All units,
I want you to converge on hangar 11,...

1341
01:35:40,321 --> 01:35:41,640
..all sides!

1342
01:35:41,721 --> 01:35:43,552
This car, McClane! Get in!

1343
01:35:43,641 --> 01:35:46,075
When the city blue show up
with their backup,...

1344
01:35:46,161 --> 01:35:47,879
..they'll pick up the pieces!

1345
01:35:47,961 --> 01:35:49,519
Now, move out!

1346
01:35:49,601 --> 01:35:52,479
McClane, say hi to my brother Vito.

1347
01:35:53,481 --> 01:35:54,960
Merry Christmas.

1348
01:35:55,041 --> 01:35:56,838
Hi.

1349
01:36:02,641 --> 01:36:06,600
Goddammit to hell!
Move that piece of shit!

1350
01:36:06,681 --> 01:36:09,593
Will you move
that goddamn piece of shit...

1351
01:36:09,681 --> 01:36:10,909
..out of here?

1352
01:36:11,001 --> 01:36:13,071
Vito, get the fuck out of the car!

1353
01:36:13,161 --> 01:36:15,231
Get your ass in gear and help me!

1354
01:36:15,321 --> 01:36:16,276
Will you get... ?

1355
01:36:16,361 --> 01:36:18,716
Move that car right now!

1356
01:36:18,801 --> 01:36:19,916
Right there. Get that.

1357
01:36:20,001 --> 01:36:21,957
Hey, Coleman!

1358
01:36:22,961 --> 01:36:25,270
Sam! Sam Coleman!

1359
01:36:27,161 --> 01:36:28,150
Hey, Coleman!

1360
01:36:28,241 --> 01:36:29,515
Hi!

1361
01:36:29,601 --> 01:36:30,954
Coleman!

1362
01:36:32,001 --> 01:36:35,357
..but at least the truth
is not among the hostages...

1363
01:36:35,441 --> 01:36:38,911
..because l, Richard Thornberg,
just happened to be here...

1364
01:36:39,001 --> 01:36:45,918
..to put his life and talent
on the line for humanity and country.

1365
01:36:46,001 --> 01:36:48,959
If this should be my final broadcast...

1366
01:36:51,041 --> 01:36:53,919
Amen to that,... Dick.

1367
01:36:54,841 --> 01:36:56,832
(reporter) Dick? We're live, Dick.

1368
01:36:56,921 --> 01:36:58,798
Where are you now?

1369
01:36:58,881 --> 01:37:00,234
Dick?

1370
01:37:02,121 --> 01:37:03,839
Truck lights approaching, sir.

1371
01:37:03,921 --> 01:37:06,310
They're here, right on schedule.

1372
01:37:06,401 --> 01:37:08,710
The hangar door, open it.

1373
01:37:08,801 --> 01:37:10,154
Clockwork.

1374
01:37:32,801 --> 01:37:36,111
Jeez, you give me this story,
and I'll have your baby.

1375
01:37:36,521 --> 01:37:38,910
Not the kind of ride I'm looking for.

1376
01:37:50,041 --> 01:37:53,317
Colonel, if I may say so,
you are some piece of work.

1377
01:37:53,401 --> 01:37:56,313
Thank you, Major.
You're not so bad yourself.

1378
01:37:56,401 --> 01:37:58,392
Congratulations on your escape, sir.

1379
01:37:58,481 --> 01:38:01,871
Thank you, Major.
Save them until we are all safe, hmm?

1380
01:38:01,961 --> 01:38:03,360
Sir.

1381
01:38:03,441 --> 01:38:05,318
My congratulations, gentlemen.

1382
01:38:05,401 --> 01:38:07,835
You've won a victory for our way of life,...

1383
01:38:07,921 --> 01:38:10,913
..my pride, my admiration,
and a kick-ass vacation.

1384
01:38:11,001 --> 01:38:12,673
Now, get on board.

1385
01:38:40,121 --> 01:38:42,760
What's the matter, cowboy?
Ride too rough?

1386
01:38:42,841 --> 01:38:45,116
- I don't like to fly.
- Then why are you here?

1387
01:38:45,201 --> 01:38:46,714
I don't like to lose, either.

1388
01:38:46,801 --> 01:38:49,474
OK, whoa! Here we go!

1389
01:38:56,761 --> 01:38:58,638
I don't know about you guys,...

1390
01:38:58,721 --> 01:39:01,679
..but I've seen enough
fucking snow to last me a lifetime.

1391
01:39:01,761 --> 01:39:03,717
You don't get much of that in the tropics.

1392
01:39:03,801 --> 01:39:06,474
For you gentlemen, we'll import it.

1393
01:39:09,281 --> 01:39:10,919
Shit! They left the hangar!

1394
01:39:14,281 --> 01:39:16,795
Right there. Right there. Get that.

1395
01:39:16,881 --> 01:39:19,031
- Now what?
- Get in front! Take it down!

1396
01:39:19,121 --> 01:39:21,112
Block their path so they can't get out!

1397
01:39:21,201 --> 01:39:22,634
I'm not playing chicken
with a 200-ton plane!

1398
01:39:22,721 --> 01:39:25,076
I'm crazy, but I ain't that crazy.
Forget it.

1399
01:39:25,161 --> 01:39:26,674
(radio) Dulles, this is Northeast 140.

1400
01:39:26,761 --> 01:39:28,991
- Request clearance to land.
- That's Holly's plane.

1401
01:39:29,081 --> 01:39:31,641
Repeat. Request emergency clearance.

1402
01:39:31,721 --> 01:39:33,791
I knowyou won't answer,
but you better listen!

1403
01:39:33,881 --> 01:39:35,997
We're down to fumes,
and we have to land.

1404
01:39:36,081 --> 01:39:38,072
In five minutes, we're coming in.

1405
01:39:38,201 --> 01:39:41,159
That's my wife's plane!
Take it fucking down!

1406
01:39:41,241 --> 01:39:43,801
I'm not getting in front of that plane!

1407
01:39:47,441 --> 01:39:49,830
All right, how about getting over top of it?

1408
01:39:49,921 --> 01:39:51,400
(PA) This is the captain.

1409
01:39:51,481 --> 01:39:52,516
Your attention.

1410
01:39:52,601 --> 01:39:55,798
We have no choice
but to attempt an emergency landing.

1411
01:39:55,881 --> 01:39:58,190
Fasten your seat belts
and assume crash positions...

1412
01:39:58,281 --> 01:40:00,590
..as instructed by your cabin attendants.

1413
01:40:00,681 --> 01:40:02,831
Let's have the emergency check list.

1414
01:40:02,921 --> 01:40:05,435
Attention, all air traffic in Dulles area.

1415
01:40:05,521 --> 01:40:06,920
This is Northeast 140.

1416
01:40:07,001 --> 01:40:09,834
We are attempting an emergency landing.
Be advised.

1417
01:40:11,521 --> 01:40:13,512
I don't want to die.

1418
01:40:13,841 --> 01:40:15,718
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.

1419
01:40:15,801 --> 01:40:17,519
Just buckle your seat belt.

1420
01:40:17,601 --> 01:40:19,034
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1421
01:40:19,121 --> 01:40:20,349
Lean forward.

1422
01:40:21,521 --> 01:40:23,477
(Thornberg) God!

1423
01:40:23,561 --> 01:40:25,677
(whimpers)

1424
01:40:28,201 --> 01:40:29,759
Oh, God.

1425
01:40:30,161 --> 01:40:31,514
Oh, God,...

1426
01:40:31,601 --> 01:40:35,310
Thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.

1427
01:40:41,201 --> 01:40:42,634
Just hang on!

1428
01:40:42,721 --> 01:40:44,518
What are you doing?

1429
01:40:44,601 --> 01:40:45,636
You wanted a story.

1430
01:40:45,721 --> 01:40:47,757
Nice and easy, boys.
Get me in low!

1431
01:40:47,841 --> 01:40:49,479
You got it!

1432
01:40:51,721 --> 01:40:53,712
Bring me down!

1433
01:40:53,801 --> 01:40:57,111
(Coleman) You'll get yourself killed!
Come back inside!

1434
01:41:03,041 --> 01:41:05,191
Bring it in low! Keep over the wing!

1435
01:41:13,001 --> 01:41:14,639
Lower!

1436
01:41:14,721 --> 01:41:15,597
Aagh!

1437
01:41:23,801 --> 01:41:27,760
John, what the fuck are you doing
out on the wing of this plane?

1438
01:41:34,001 --> 01:41:35,434
Damn!

1439
01:41:40,761 --> 01:41:42,319
Mierda.

1440
01:41:42,401 --> 01:41:43,800
There's something wrong.

1441
01:41:44,841 --> 01:41:46,399
The ailerons.

1442
01:41:46,481 --> 01:41:47,550
We can't take off.

1443
01:41:51,321 --> 01:41:54,154
Hijo de puta. It's McClane again.

1444
01:41:55,681 --> 01:41:57,034
Son of a bitch!

1445
01:41:59,041 --> 01:42:01,760
- I'll do him.
- This time do it right.

1446
01:42:01,841 --> 01:42:03,877
You just get us in the air, General.

1447
01:42:03,961 --> 01:42:05,474
Only you can do it.

1448
01:42:05,561 --> 01:42:07,438
Don't shoot.
That wing is fully fuelled.

1449
01:42:57,761 --> 01:43:00,559
Too bad, McClane.
I kind of liked you!

1450
01:43:04,321 --> 01:43:05,356
Whoa!

1451
01:43:07,921 --> 01:43:10,276
I got enough friends!

1452
01:43:12,841 --> 01:43:14,160
Aagh!

1453
01:43:45,441 --> 01:43:47,113
OK, McClane!

1454
01:43:47,201 --> 01:43:48,395
Time for the main event!

1455
01:43:58,481 --> 01:43:59,470
(spits)

1456
01:44:23,521 --> 01:44:25,034
Motherfucker!

1457
01:44:32,321 --> 01:44:33,470
Agh!

1458
01:44:34,961 --> 01:44:36,110
(laughs)

1459
01:44:36,201 --> 01:44:37,316
How's it going?

1460
01:44:40,841 --> 01:44:42,479
Bon voyage!

1461
01:44:49,001 --> 01:44:51,674
Happy landings, asshole!

1462
01:45:40,321 --> 01:45:42,277
Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker.

1463
01:45:54,441 --> 01:45:56,193
Yeah. All right.

1464
01:46:09,921 --> 01:46:11,400
Aagh!

1465
01:46:15,201 --> 01:46:16,190
Whoa!

1466
01:46:23,041 --> 01:46:25,874
(laughs)

1467
01:46:25,961 --> 01:46:28,350
Aaah!

1468
01:46:32,201 --> 01:46:34,396
Holly!

1469
01:46:34,481 --> 01:46:37,439
Here's your fucking landing light!

1470
01:46:37,521 --> 01:46:38,636
Whoa!

1471
01:46:44,321 --> 01:46:45,720
Oh, God.

1472
01:46:45,841 --> 01:46:47,957
(prays)

1473
01:46:48,041 --> 01:46:49,474
Look!

1474
01:46:49,561 --> 01:46:52,029
Look! OK, I see it! I see it!

1475
01:47:16,561 --> 01:47:18,472
They used the fucking fire to see!

1476
01:47:18,561 --> 01:47:20,677
They can all do that. Let's tell them.

1477
01:47:20,761 --> 01:47:22,752
They already know.

1478
01:47:22,841 --> 01:47:24,672
(radio) We had a visual on the landing.

1479
01:47:24,761 --> 01:47:27,070
- Listen.
- We're following the fiire trail in...

1480
01:47:27,161 --> 01:47:28,514
If they can do it, so can we!

1481
01:47:45,001 --> 01:47:46,275
Whoa!

1482
01:47:46,361 --> 01:47:49,159
Any landing you can walk away from
is a good one.

1483
01:47:49,241 --> 01:47:50,879
Phew!

1484
01:48:12,441 --> 01:48:14,432
Uh!

1485
01:48:17,801 --> 01:48:18,790
Jump!

1486
01:48:20,201 --> 01:48:22,351
- Jump!
- I got you!

1487
01:48:22,441 --> 01:48:23,510
Jump!

1488
01:48:23,601 --> 01:48:26,274
(sirens)

1489
01:48:33,841 --> 01:48:35,832
(cheering)

1490
01:48:51,161 --> 01:48:52,719
There you go. That's it.

1491
01:48:53,921 --> 01:48:55,195
There he is!

1492
01:48:55,401 --> 01:48:56,550
That's it!

1493
01:48:57,921 --> 01:49:01,277
Holly!

1494
01:49:04,161 --> 01:49:07,358
Holly!

1495
01:49:08,041 --> 01:49:09,599
Holly!

1496
01:49:12,361 --> 01:49:14,192
Holly!

1497
01:49:17,001 --> 01:49:19,799
Holly!

1498
01:49:21,921 --> 01:49:24,754
Holly!

1499
01:49:28,641 --> 01:49:30,836
Holly!

1500
01:49:34,921 --> 01:49:36,149
Holly!

1501
01:49:38,721 --> 01:49:41,838
Come on! We got you!

1502
01:49:45,921 --> 01:49:48,719
Oh, God. Oh, baby.

1503
01:49:48,801 --> 01:49:51,156
I thought I was never
going to see you again.

1504
01:49:51,241 --> 01:49:53,357
That's what I thought about you.

1505
01:49:53,441 --> 01:49:55,238
I love you so much.

1506
01:49:58,561 --> 01:50:01,359
They told me
there were terrorists at the airport.

1507
01:50:01,441 --> 01:50:04,751
Yeah. I heard that, too.

1508
01:50:12,001 --> 01:50:13,673
God, that's beautiful.

1509
01:50:13,761 --> 01:50:15,672
Yeah.

1510
01:50:16,641 --> 01:50:20,190
Yup, it sure is.

1511
01:50:20,281 --> 01:50:22,431
Oh, I love you so much.

1512
01:50:25,281 --> 01:50:26,396
Oh, John.

1513
01:50:27,041 --> 01:50:29,714
Why does this keep happening to us?

1514
01:50:35,321 --> 01:50:37,391
Let's go home.

1515
01:50:38,121 --> 01:50:39,600
Get in the truck!

1516
01:50:39,721 --> 01:50:41,552
Let's get her out of here!

1517
01:50:41,641 --> 01:50:43,950
Somebody help me, please!

1518
01:50:44,041 --> 01:50:45,872
Oh, honey, help me up here, please.

1519
01:50:45,961 --> 01:50:47,553
Asshole!

1520
01:50:50,841 --> 01:50:53,036
Hey, officer! Hey, come on!

1521
01:50:53,121 --> 01:50:54,474
Hey, hey!

1522
01:50:54,561 --> 01:50:57,439
Hop on in here! Get your missus in!

1523
01:50:57,521 --> 01:50:59,079
What do you say, Marv?

1524
01:50:59,161 --> 01:51:02,790
I'll be damned if I'm going
to clean up this mess!

1525
01:51:02,881 --> 01:51:04,712
(laughs)

1526
01:51:04,801 --> 01:51:06,757
(siren)

1527
01:51:09,921 --> 01:51:10,910
Hey, McClane!

1528
01:51:12,761 --> 01:51:15,833
You get this parking ticket
in front of my airport?

1529
01:51:17,081 --> 01:51:18,719
Yeah.

1530
01:51:18,801 --> 01:51:22,476
Ah, what the hell. It's Christmas!

1531
01:51:25,321 --> 01:51:27,312
# Oh, the weather outside is frightful

1532
01:51:27,401 --> 01:51:28,390
Take off, Marv!

1533
01:51:28,481 --> 01:51:32,269
# But the fiire is so delightful

1534
01:51:32,361 --> 01:51:36,400
# And since we've no place to go

1535
01:51:36,481 --> 01:51:40,235
# Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

1536
01:51:40,321 --> 01:51:43,677
# It doesn't show signs ofstopping

1537
01:51:43,761 --> 01:51:47,390
# Andl brought some corn forpopping

1538
01:51:47,481 --> 01:51:50,871
# The lights are turned way down low

1539
01:51:50,961 --> 01:51:54,476
# Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

1540
01:51:54,561 --> 01:51:58,156
# When we fiinally kiss goodnight

1541
01:51:58,241 --> 01:52:01,836
# Howl hate going out in the storm

1542
01:52:01,921 --> 01:52:05,880
# But ifyou'll really hold me tight

1543
01:52:05,961 --> 01:52:09,397
# All the way home I'll be warm

1544
01:52:09,481 --> 01:52:12,757
# The fiire is slowly dying

1545
01:52:12,841 --> 01:52:16,356
# And, my dear, we're still goodbyeing

1546
01:52:16,441 --> 01:52:19,956
# But as long as you love me so

1547
01:52:20,041 --> 01:52:23,477
# Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

1548
01:52:23,561 --> 01:52:27,156
# When we fiinally kiss goodnight

1549
01:52:27,241 --> 01:52:30,756
# Howl hate going out in the storm

# All the way home I'll be warm
