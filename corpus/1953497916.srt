1
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,489
This boyfriend
was really cute--

2
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:28,327
handsome, always voted, like,
best eyes, best hair,

3
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:29,728
that type of thing in school,

4
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,331
so there's like,
a lot of butterflies,

5
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:33,732
a lot of excitement

6
00:00:33,734 --> 00:00:35,734
for me because that's, like,

7
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:40,272
you know, it was just exciting
that somebody like that

8
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:44,043
would be, you know, so
interested in someone like me.

9
00:00:44,045 --> 00:00:45,677
I just remember being
in this Italian restaurant

10
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:47,346
and we ordered, like, a pizza
to share

11
00:00:47,348 --> 00:00:51,750
and the cheese was kind of
stringing out of my mouth

12
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:55,120
and, you know, there's just
no good way to handle that.

13
00:00:55,122 --> 00:00:56,488
So, that was embarrassing.

14
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,290
And I thought,
oh, why did you order pizza

15
00:00:58,292 --> 00:01:00,325
on your first ever date?

16
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:02,761
I mean, he really loved to shop.

17
00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:05,097
And he really loved
to buy things for me.

18
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:09,501
And he lived with two
really... very out men

19
00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:11,170
who, one time I came over there,

20
00:01:11,172 --> 00:01:12,538
and they were shaving
each other's backs

21
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,806
for a drag contest

22
00:01:13,808 --> 00:01:16,675
and I thought...
it's not typical to...

23
00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:18,777
it's not a typical scenario.

24
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:20,813
Three years since I'd seen him,

25
00:01:20,815 --> 00:01:24,349
and we were standing there
talking about nothing,

26
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:25,651
like something completely inane.

27
00:01:25,653 --> 00:01:28,120
And my parents were
boring down on us.

28
00:01:28,122 --> 00:01:33,659
And then completely
unconsciously,

29
00:01:33,661 --> 00:01:38,397
I put my finger
on his widow's peak.

30
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:40,332
Just out of nowhere.

31
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:43,635
Completely unconsciously.

32
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:47,706
I hadn't touched him
in three years.

33
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:49,374
And I remember very distinctly,

34
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:51,343
like, waking up
in his little twin bed

35
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:53,345
that he had that we would share
when I was visiting

36
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:57,416
and finding these long, black
hairs on the pillow.

37
00:01:57,418 --> 00:02:02,554
Yeah, and... and I was sort of,
like, you know, "What's this?"

38
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:05,290
We broke up
and he gave me an Elvis doll.

39
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:06,725
It was really weird.

40
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:11,430
He was like, "I know we...
you're leaving. Here."

41
00:02:11,432 --> 00:02:13,832
And I opened it and it was,
you know,

42
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:16,635
like a collector's item
Elvis doll

43
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,303
in a wrapping.

44
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:22,207
It was, like, the strangest
breakup parting gift

45
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:23,575
I think there could be.

46
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:26,211
If I saw him or I found out
anything about him,

47
00:02:26,213 --> 00:02:30,516
it would destroy these
beautiful memories that I have.

48
00:02:30,518 --> 00:02:34,786
'Cause there's something about
that first high school romance.

49
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:37,589
There's, like, a glow to it
in your mind,

50
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:40,325
even if it wasn't
really like that.

51
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:41,860
The second we got together,

52
00:02:41,862 --> 00:02:45,397
I instantly stopped caring
about what other people thought,

53
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:49,434
because I had Jason
and he had me.

54
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:55,607
And for that last glorious
chunk of high school,

55
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:57,409
that freedom we shared,

56
00:02:57,411 --> 00:03:00,345
it meant everything.

57
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,814
MAN: And then?

58
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:06,351
Uh, we went
to different schools.

59
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:10,355
Was it mutual or...

60
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:14,359
which one of you first decided
to end the relationship?

61
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,499
Mm... neither of us.

62
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:22,868
Neither of us ended it.

63
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:28,974
You told me things ended
before college.

64
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:35,514
Yeah, I suppose that's true,
but in reality,

65
00:03:35,516 --> 00:03:37,649
we didn't break up.

66
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:39,918
We never have.

67
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,423
♪

68
00:03:44,425 --> 00:03:46,391
Come on.

69
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:51,263
(bell chimes, jingles)

70
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:55,701
(dogs barking)
Go on. Who needs a walk?

71
00:03:55,703 --> 00:03:57,302
What about Sadie?
Uh-uh.

72
00:03:57,304 --> 00:03:59,705
You took her a couple of
hours ago with Rico and Doc.

73
00:03:59,707 --> 00:04:00,906
What about Molly?

74
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:02,841
She's getting picked
up in 20 minutes.

75
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:05,777
Alicia, did you give Moses
a bath like I asked?

76
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:07,512
MAN: I think all these rascals
are good for now, boss.

77
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:09,681
I think Primo and Doxy need
to learn to get along better.

78
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:11,383
I'm gonna take them out
together.

79
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:13,552
I can take them.
No, it's all right,
I got them. Come on.

80
00:04:13,554 --> 00:04:15,554
Primo's being a dick
today anyways.

81
00:04:15,556 --> 00:04:17,522
All righty.
See you in 45.

82
00:04:17,524 --> 00:04:18,690
Come on.
Adeus.

83
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:20,325
(dog barking)

84
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:31,570
(dogs barking)

85
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:41,313
(dog whining)

86
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:42,981
I know. I know, Cocoa.

87
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:45,317
I'm going to be right there.

88
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:46,652
(panting)

89
00:04:46,654 --> 00:04:49,421
(chuckling):
Oh...

90
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:51,556
Come here, come here.

91
00:04:51,558 --> 00:04:52,891
Are you ready to go?

92
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:54,526
There you go, sweetie.

93
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,334
(dog yawning)

94
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:11,743
<i>I am not at all</i>
<i>the type of person</i>

95
00:05:11,745 --> 00:05:13,578
to try out
for a reality show.

96
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,880
No. (chuckles)

97
00:05:14,882 --> 00:05:17,015
My show will
be for people
who are curious.

98
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:22,487
People wonder, "What if?"
from time to time.

99
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:23,889
What about my old boy-- Jason?

100
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:26,792
Are you gonna have to get to
know him, too, if we do this?

101
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:29,728
I've been in touch with him.

102
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,363
(laughs)

103
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:33,365
Wow, God, h-how is he?

104
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:35,367
The way I approached
it with Jason

105
00:05:35,369 --> 00:05:37,736
is that we were doing a show
about past relationships.

106
00:05:37,738 --> 00:05:40,906
I couldn't tell him I intended
to reunite the two of you

107
00:05:40,908 --> 00:05:42,374
because if we were
to film it,

108
00:05:42,376 --> 00:05:44,910
it would need
to be a surprise.

109
00:05:44,912 --> 00:05:47,446
So when are we
gonna do this?
Emmie,

110
00:05:47,448 --> 00:05:50,916
unfortunately, after speaking
with Jason, it seems

111
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:52,784
you don't meet
the qualifications

112
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:54,753
as a subject for the show.
What qualifications?

113
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:56,555
I don't understand;
you said that

114
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:58,557
I was one of
the final candidates.

115
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:00,392
As he was sharing with me

116
00:06:00,394 --> 00:06:02,928
some of his thoughts
about previous girlfriends...

117
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:05,664
Did he mention me much or...?
Emmie, why didn't you

118
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:06,965
tell me you and Jason
have been in contact

119
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:09,668
over the past
couple years?

120
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,069
He sent me a couple
of postcards.

121
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:12,671
I never mailed anything back.

122
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:14,539
It doesn't constitute contact.

123
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,907
It was nothing.

124
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:18,844
Okay, everybody, now, for
your very first lobster ever,

125
00:06:18,846 --> 00:06:21,680
you have to learn
one essential rule,

126
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:24,983
and that is that not only
can you be unafraid of
getting messy,

127
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:27,586
but you have to love
being messy.

128
00:06:27,588 --> 00:06:29,454
Yo, yo!
Like love it. Yes?

129
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:30,589
You promised.

130
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:32,424
Okay, I know.

131
00:06:32,426 --> 00:06:34,659
I can't do it right.
Okay,
I'm coming.

132
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:36,895
Well, when? Table six is almost
ready for their dessert.

133
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:38,497
Very soon.
Hurry up.

134
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:39,498
Okay.

135
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,832
Sorry about that.

136
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:43,135
Who was that?
I don't even know who that was.

137
00:06:43,137 --> 00:06:45,704
She doesn't work here.
She just likes the uniform,

138
00:06:45,706 --> 00:06:48,673
so we let her, like, run around
and bark orders at people.

139
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:50,442
Okay, for the demonstration,

140
00:06:50,444 --> 00:06:55,113
I am calling on the assistance
of my trusty assistant, lobster,

141
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:57,082
but there's a problem
with this lobster.

142
00:06:57,084 --> 00:07:00,485
He doesn't have a name,
and I need him to have a name.

143
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:03,555
Is there a name
that you guys can help me with?

144
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:05,056
Please. Yes, what is it?

145
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:07,492
Bob.
Bob? Are you serious?

146
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:10,996
You know, he actually
does look like a Bob.

147
00:07:10,998 --> 00:07:12,531
So, this...
I'm in luck.

148
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:14,499
Thank you very much.
You know what, you should

149
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:17,035
help me name
some of my frogs.
You have frogs?

150
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:19,137
I do have frogs;
I have a lot of frogs actually.

151
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:21,006
Once you guys are black belts
at this,

152
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:22,874
I'm going to tell you all
about what I do in real life.

153
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:25,710
Now, everybody,
grab your crackers.

154
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:27,679

00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:38,089

(door closes)

159
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:00,612
Em.

160
00:08:00,614 --> 00:08:02,848
We'll talk tomorrow.
Don't wake yourself up.

161
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,916
No, I'm up,
I'm up.

162
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:08,653
I want... I want to,
I want to hear about it.

163
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,655
How'd it go?

353
00:20:29,495 --> 00:20:30,661
No, no, no.

354
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:33,264
Okay, okay, um...

355
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:35,566
When was the last time
you-you-you did...

356
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:37,969
you did that for me?

357
00:20:37,971 --> 00:20:39,337
I don't know.

358
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:40,538
Just think about it.

359
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,839
(sighs)

360
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:44,308
Um...

361
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,544
(sighs)

362
00:20:46,546 --> 00:20:48,646
I guess it's been a while.
Yeah.

363
00:20:48,648 --> 00:20:51,415
It's been a while.
It's been 365 days.

364
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:52,783
No.
Yeah.

365
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:55,553
No, it has, I-I swear,
I've... kept track.

366
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:57,288
It's been a whole year?
Mm-hmm.

367
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:58,422
Yeah.

368
00:20:58,424 --> 00:20:59,824
Ooh.

369
00:20:59,826 --> 00:21:01,892
The last time that-that
you gave me head

370
00:21:01,894 --> 00:21:03,494
was on my last birthday.

371
00:21:03,496 --> 00:21:06,430
Okay? But if you think about
it, like, the first year

372
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:10,034
that we were, like, hanging
out or whatever, together...

373
00:21:10,036 --> 00:21:12,703
you did it, I mean, probably
like a hundred times.

374
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:14,972
But, you know, ever since then,
like for the past couple years,

375
00:21:14,974 --> 00:21:17,575
it's only been
on my birthday.

376
00:21:17,577 --> 00:21:20,311
Now, we-we've been together

377
00:21:20,313 --> 00:21:23,648
off and on for, like,
three years. Right?

378
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:26,417
So that means that
if we stay together,

379
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:29,720
then I'll only get
a blow job once a year

380
00:21:29,722 --> 00:21:31,422
until, you know,
who knows when?

381
00:21:31,424 --> 00:21:33,991
See, that's why I don't want
you to do it right now.

382
00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:35,826
Because if you give
me head right now,

383
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:37,728
that means I know
for a fact that

384
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:39,664
I won't get it again
until my next birthday.

385
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:40,965
But on the other hand,

386
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:42,933
if I don't let you
do it right now...

387
00:21:42,935 --> 00:21:44,835
No, that's not what I meant.

388
00:21:44,837 --> 00:21:46,470
I didn't mean "let you,"

389
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:49,340
I mean, like, if you choose
not to perform it right now,

390
00:21:49,342 --> 00:21:52,310
then that means I can go about
the rest of our relationship,

391
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:55,646
you know, with the...
the outside chance,

392
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:57,481
the-the hope against hope

393
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:59,984
that I could get a-a blow
job on any given night.

394
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:01,619
I mean, who knows
when it'll happen?

395
00:22:01,621 --> 00:22:03,587
You know? And that's
exciting to me.

396
00:22:03,589 --> 00:22:05,022
That's an exciting
way to live.

397
00:22:05,024 --> 00:22:07,792
Like, I would rather live
with the minute possibility

398
00:22:07,794 --> 00:22:09,460
that it could happen
at any moment

399
00:22:09,462 --> 00:22:10,728
rather than the assurance

400
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:13,364
that-that it'll happen

401
00:22:13,366 --> 00:22:15,599
just once a year.

402
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:19,804
Hmm.

403
00:22:19,806 --> 00:22:22,606
What did you mean,
"if we stay together"?

404
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:26,043
I didn't say that.
Yeah, you did.

405
00:22:26,045 --> 00:22:28,512
No. I...

406
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:29,914
I did?

407
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:31,649
Well, that's not the...

408
00:22:31,651 --> 00:22:34,051
I'm... that's beside the point.

409
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:35,953
Becker...

410
00:22:35,955 --> 00:22:38,589
Don't call me that.

411
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:41,992
So... you know, I-I...

412
00:22:41,994 --> 00:22:44,929
I really tried
to make this special.

413
00:22:44,931 --> 00:22:46,897
This is the first time
since we've been together

414
00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:48,532
I have even been to your town,

415
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:50,701
much less
to your apartment.

416
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:53,738
Well, you're the one who's
always wanted to come here.

417
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:56,907
(choking up):
Oh, why am I always doing this?

418
00:22:57,943 --> 00:23:00,578
Beck, why are you crying?

419
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,749
I'm crying 'cause I love you.

420
00:23:04,751 --> 00:23:07,084
Why would you cry
about something like that?

421
00:23:07,086 --> 00:23:09,553
'Cause
you don't love me.

422
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:11,956
You love... frogs.

came home, or--

I should say-- when your
father dragged his butt

away from that girl,

473

we haven't kept any booze

you spend a little time with him
and tell me if you disagree.

00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:41,004
all of a sudden, I'm fuckin'
bawling like an infant

530
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:43,407
and I can't stop.

531
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:51,248
Mom thinks you're drinking
because you're depressed.

532
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,883
Yeah.

533
00:30:52,885 --> 00:30:54,418
Hm.

534
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,887
Yeah, Mrs. Web, MD,
has shared that theory with me,

535
00:30:56,889 --> 00:30:59,022
like, a thousand times.

536
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:00,157
Mm.

537
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,092
Well, what do you think?

538
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:06,129
I don't know, I mean...

539
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,137
Been having a hard time.

540
00:31:14,139 --> 00:31:15,572
Yeah?

541
00:31:15,574 --> 00:31:17,107
Yeah.

542
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:21,044
Like...

543
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:24,581
before Mom and Dad made me
move out of Shannon's, uh...

544
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:32,956
...like, the only time I wasn't
crying was when I was drunk.

545
00:31:32,958 --> 00:31:36,126
(Gail and Marty arguing,
muffled through wall)

546
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:41,198
God, do they always
fight like this?

547
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,966
No, not really.

548
00:31:42,968 --> 00:31:45,636
Only when he gets home
from the titty bar.

549
00:31:45,638 --> 00:31:47,938
Does Grandma hear?

550
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,306
She's oblivious.

551
00:31:49,308 --> 00:31:51,074
She's so into
some older than dirt dude,

552
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:53,143
I don't think she's
aware of anything else.

553
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:54,945
Grandma's got a boyfriend?

554
00:31:54,947 --> 00:31:56,113
I guess.

555
00:31:56,115 --> 00:31:58,282
That is so sweet.

556
00:31:58,284 --> 00:32:00,684
It's gross.

557
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:04,955
God, it's so weird.

558
00:32:04,957 --> 00:32:08,191
All they wanted was for us
to be happy.

559
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:13,263
Were they happy
when we were little?

560
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:16,667
I don't know.

561
00:32:16,669 --> 00:32:19,102
I didn't think about it
like that then.

562
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:25,375
Is that why you're home?

563
00:32:25,377 --> 00:32:27,477
You're unhappy?

564
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:34,217
I have some
unfinished business.

565
00:32:34,219 --> 00:32:35,652
(wry laugh)

566
00:32:35,654 --> 00:32:37,387
What? What?

567
00:32:37,389 --> 00:32:40,057
That... that's what
"hometown" means.

568
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:42,392
This place is nothing but
unfinished business.

569
00:32:42,394 --> 00:32:44,194
I guess so, yeah.

570
00:32:46,664 --> 00:32:51,001
Are you and Graham the way mom
and dad were, you think?

571
00:32:51,003 --> 00:32:53,236
Mm...

572
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:04,715
I always thought that I would
end up with somebody

573
00:33:04,717 --> 00:33:08,418
who made the world
feel bigger to me.

574
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:13,290
And Graham and I have been
together for five years,

575
00:33:13,292 --> 00:33:16,393
and...

576
00:33:16,395 --> 00:33:20,163
I feel like he makes
the world smaller.

577
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:22,566
You think Jason Barrister

578
00:33:22,568 --> 00:33:25,569
would've made
the world bigger for you?

579
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:29,039
Maybe.

580
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:30,273
He did before.

581
00:33:30,275 --> 00:33:31,775
Well, that was
different, I mean...

582
00:33:31,777 --> 00:33:33,643
How?

583
00:33:37,081 --> 00:33:39,583
You know, I was playing Ultimate
a lot with him, in the fall.

584
00:33:39,585 --> 00:33:41,051
Really?
Yeah.

585
00:33:41,053 --> 00:33:44,221
He's a little overly competitive

586
00:33:44,223 --> 00:33:45,589
for my taste, but...

587
00:33:45,591 --> 00:33:47,724
overall, he's a good guy.

588
00:33:47,726 --> 00:33:50,027
He always asked
me about you.

589
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,138
No way.

590
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,339
You like it?

591
00:34:02,341 --> 00:34:04,641
Oh, man!
This is pretty sweet.

592
00:34:04,643 --> 00:34:07,210
Do you think, uh...
do you think Karen will like it?

593
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:08,211
And be honest.

594
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:09,212
Are you kidding me?

595
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:11,048
She'll flip.
Yeah?

596
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:12,582
Okay. Awesome.

597
00:34:12,584 --> 00:34:14,785
Let me pay you
something for it.

598
00:34:14,787 --> 00:34:16,686
Pay me?
Are you kidding? No way.

599
00:34:16,688 --> 00:34:18,321
This is very generous, Jason.

600
00:34:18,323 --> 00:34:20,290
I feel like I should at least
pay you for the frame.

601
00:34:20,292 --> 00:34:24,194
Well, it's a gift for you
guys and the-the, the baby.

602
00:34:24,196 --> 00:34:26,463
Probably be worth
something someday, huh?

603
00:34:26,465 --> 00:34:28,065
Ah...

604
00:34:28,067 --> 00:34:31,401
Well, I, in return,
have a favor for you.

605
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:33,103
Okay.

606
00:34:33,105 --> 00:34:35,272
As much as I'm gonna miss
seeing you every day,

607
00:34:35,274 --> 00:34:37,374
I've gotten orders
from on high

608
00:34:37,376 --> 00:34:39,576
to transfer you to
our new location.

609
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:41,144
Where's that?

610
00:34:41,146 --> 00:34:42,245
Damariscotta.

611
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:45,849
You believe that?

612
00:34:45,851 --> 00:34:48,318
Huh.

613
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:53,590
Well, um...

614
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:55,358
No, thanks.
Jason, did you
not hear me?

615
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,228
No more hour and a half drive
each way for you anymore.

616
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,629
No, I heard you.

617
00:34:59,631 --> 00:35:01,565
Um, you know, I'm good.

618
00:35:01,567 --> 00:35:02,833
I'm...
I don't get you, man.

619
00:35:02,835 --> 00:35:04,734
The new place is
going to be like

620
00:35:04,736 --> 00:35:06,503
five minutes from
your apartment, right?
Yeah.

621
00:35:06,505 --> 00:35:07,771
I mean, I do appreciate it,

622
00:35:07,773 --> 00:35:09,773
but I-I just...
I mean, if I wanted to

623
00:35:09,775 --> 00:35:11,475
work in Damariscotta...
Why drive all the way
to work here...

624
00:35:11,477 --> 00:35:13,176
I would work in
Damariscotta, Kyle, so...

625
00:35:13,178 --> 00:35:16,146
You must be blowing a third
of your tips on gas.
I am not.

626
00:35:16,148 --> 00:35:18,281
I'm not, I'm actually...
You told me no one
was hiring up there.

627
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:22,586
Well... it's, you know, it's a,
it's a more nuanced issue.

628
00:35:22,588 --> 00:35:25,522
Thank you very much.

629
00:35:25,524 --> 00:35:26,823
But no, thanks. I'm, uh...

630
00:35:26,825 --> 00:35:28,859
I'm sorry, Jason.
The Campbells asked me

631
00:35:28,861 --> 00:35:31,261
to send my very best
for the new place.

632
00:35:31,263 --> 00:35:32,429
Then send Kate.

633
00:35:32,431 --> 00:35:34,498
Or-or-or Dara, or Mike.

634
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,566
Mike's... getting pretty good.

635
00:35:36,568 --> 00:35:38,168
Those guys live here,

636
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:41,638
Why should I ask them
to drive that far?

637
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,709
I won't do it.

638
00:35:45,711 --> 00:35:48,278
Tracy, the manager
up there, she's cool.

639
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,847
She'll let you hand out your
business cards to customers.

640
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:57,654
Just think about it.

641
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:05,395
(birds chirping)

642
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:11,468
BRANDON:
<i>I'm not sure about this.</i>

643
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:13,203
EMMIE:
You are so good.

644
00:36:13,205 --> 00:36:17,607
I'm not worried about
how I'll play, Em.

645
00:36:17,609 --> 00:36:19,543
What if I start...

646
00:36:19,545 --> 00:36:21,678
you know?

647
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,417
Here.

648
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:34,758
(giggles)
Are they dumb?

649
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,594
You look like you're
in a video game.

650
00:36:37,596 --> 00:36:39,362
You look cool!

651
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:40,730
Like the Terminator.
Shut up.

652
00:36:40,732 --> 00:36:42,632
(laughs)
You're an ass.

653
00:36:42,634 --> 00:36:45,268
You all right?

654
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:46,836
(sighs)
Yeah, I guess.

655
00:36:46,838 --> 00:36:49,739
Except what did you
want me to tell him?
Nothing.

656
00:36:49,741 --> 00:36:51,641
Look, I don't want him
to know I'm here.

657
00:36:51,643 --> 00:36:52,943
Then why are you coming?

658
00:36:52,945 --> 00:36:56,713
What, are you going to like,
hide behind a bush

659
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:57,914
or something, and spy?

660
00:36:57,916 --> 00:37:00,884
Well, are there bushes
near the field?

661
00:37:00,886 --> 00:37:02,385
Don't look at me like that.

662
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:04,788
Psycho.

663
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:09,326
Okay. Technically,
we never broke up.

664
00:37:09,328 --> 00:37:10,660
What?

665
00:37:10,662 --> 00:37:13,964
Well, it wasn't ever said,
the-the words.

666
00:37:13,966 --> 00:37:17,400
We never broke up.

667
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:19,402
So you're two-timing Graham?

668
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:23,340
Or maybe I've been cheating
on Jason all these years.

669
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:28,712
MAN:
Got it?

670
00:37:28,714 --> 00:37:30,547
Yeah. I think.

671
00:37:30,549 --> 00:37:32,649
Hey! (whoops)

672
00:37:32,651 --> 00:37:35,285
(low, overlapping chatter,
laughter)

673
00:37:35,287 --> 00:37:37,487
(man yells)

674
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:39,889
(low, overlapping chatter)

675
00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:45,962
MAN: Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Yeah, yeah!

676
00:37:45,964 --> 00:37:48,431
Oh!

677
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:53,970
(low, overlapping chatter)

678
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,881
(low, overlapping chatter)

679
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:11,554
Yes!

680
00:38:11,556 --> 00:38:13,923
(cheering)
Excellent.

681
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:19,396
JASON:
Good game, guys.

682
00:38:30,007 --> 00:38:32,475
Hey, old buddy.

683
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:34,477
How you doing?

684
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:35,745
Good to see you, man.

685
00:38:35,747 --> 00:38:37,480
Yeah, you, too.

686
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:38,615
Where you been?

687
00:38:38,617 --> 00:38:39,783
Uh...

688
00:38:39,785 --> 00:38:41,751
Oh, you know, uh...

689
00:38:41,753 --> 00:38:42,886
just needed...

690
00:38:42,888 --> 00:38:44,421
you know, some time off.

691
00:38:44,423 --> 00:38:46,589
Yeah? All right.

692
00:38:46,591 --> 00:38:48,024
I'm glad you're back.

693
00:38:48,026 --> 00:38:51,594
What's new with you, Jason?

694
00:38:51,596 --> 00:38:52,862
Oh, you know, just

695
00:38:52,864 --> 00:38:57,467
taking a lifetime to
become an overnight success.

696
00:38:58,636 --> 00:39:02,339
Wh... What do you do for money?

697
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:05,008
Just my art.

698
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:07,010
That pays the
bills and shit?

699
00:39:07,012 --> 00:39:07,977
Yeah.
Wow.

700
00:39:07,979 --> 00:39:10,480
That's fucking cool.

701
00:39:10,482 --> 00:39:11,748
Yeah.

702
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:13,350
Yeah, I'm lucky.

703
00:39:13,352 --> 00:39:15,485
I mean, I'm not exactly
swimming in it yet,

704
00:39:15,487 --> 00:39:18,521
but... you know.

705
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:20,924
I get along decent enough.

706
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:29,632
How's that girl
you were seeing?

707
00:39:29,634 --> 00:39:31,801
Who, Becky?
Yeah.

708
00:39:31,803 --> 00:39:33,937
Well, she's not the one.

709
00:39:33,939 --> 00:39:37,073
Is there really
such a thing?

710
00:39:37,075 --> 00:39:38,742
Well, maybe not for everyone.

711
00:39:38,744 --> 00:39:42,479
But... your sister
sure spoiled me.

712
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:44,981
Isn't that relationship

713
00:39:44,983 --> 00:39:47,684
kind of an unrealistic
barometer at this point?

714
00:39:47,686 --> 00:39:50,687
Wow, you are one
romantic son of a bitch,

715
00:39:50,689 --> 00:39:52,889
anybody ever tell you that?

716
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:55,392
Maybe you and Emmie are lucky.

717
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,962
Me   <i>an</i>Emmie?

718
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:02,165
Me   <i>an</i>Emmie.

719
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:09,539
Did she say something?

720
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:13,109
No.

721
00:40:15,112 --> 00:40:18,114
All right.

722
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:23,586
Hey, what's her husband like?

723
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:25,822
Just...

724
00:40:25,824 --> 00:40:28,425
Uh...

725
00:40:28,427 --> 00:40:29,993
Yeah, it's...

726
00:40:29,995 --> 00:40:31,728
I don't feel comfortable
talking about him.

727
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:33,663
Sure, yeah.
Sorry.

728
00:40:33,665 --> 00:40:35,765
Well, maybe I'll
get to meet him

729
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:38,468
myself one day, you know?

730
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:39,636
Does she ever

731
00:40:39,638 --> 00:40:42,038
come to visit?

732
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:56,219
(stifled sobbing)

733
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:00,223
Hey.
(sobs once)

734
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:05,028
Are you crying?

735
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:09,165
Yeah.

736
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:13,136
(sighs)

737
00:41:13,138 --> 00:41:15,638
I'm sorry, Brandon, I didn't
mean to, like, get heavy

738
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:19,142
or-or wh... whatever it is.

739
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:22,879
Hey. Why don't you and I...

740
00:41:22,881 --> 00:41:25,982
like, get together and hang out?

741
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:30,787
You know, there aren't that
many people left around here

742
00:41:30,789 --> 00:41:32,055
worth hanging out with

743
00:41:32,057 --> 00:41:34,657
that don't have
little squirts, so...

744
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:40,730
I should be done with some
paintings I gotta work on

745
00:41:40,732 --> 00:41:41,998
this afternoon around 6:00.

746
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,501
Swing by at 7:00?

747
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:47,904
You remember where
my folks live?

748
00:41:47,906 --> 00:41:50,540
Yeah.

749
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:04,187
(car engine starts)

750
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:13,029
(phone ringing)

751
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,101
(engine revving,
tires squealing)

752
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:21,638
BRANDON:
Em. Em!

753
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:22,805
Goddamn it.

754
00:42:22,807 --> 00:42:25,074
Em! Wait up!

755
00:42:25,076 --> 00:42:26,943
Em! Jesus Christ.

756
00:42:26,945 --> 00:42:28,778
Em, fuck. You're gonna
fucking kill me.

757
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,647
I'm sorry!
Jesus, I'm sorry.

758
00:42:39,156 --> 00:42:41,791
GRAHAM:
I just... at least just tell me

759
00:42:41,793 --> 00:42:43,059
if she's okay.

760
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:45,728
GAIL:
If I knew, I would tell you.

761
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:47,096
Aren't you worried about her?

762
00:42:47,098 --> 00:42:49,999
Of course, Graham.

763
00:42:50,001 --> 00:42:52,235
If I hear from her,
I'll have her call you.

764
00:42:52,237 --> 00:42:54,337
Well, I've already left her
about a million messages.

765
00:42:54,339 --> 00:42:56,873
Obviously, she'll call me
when she feels like it, I...

766
00:42:56,875 --> 00:42:58,575
(sighs)

767
00:42:58,577 --> 00:43:00,944
Just please, just let me know
if you hear from her, okay?

768
00:43:00,946 --> 00:43:02,278
I'm sure she's fine.

769
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,881
We all know Emmie can
take care of herself.

770
00:43:06,283 --> 00:43:07,951
All right, tell her I love her.

771
00:43:07,953 --> 00:43:10,753
If I talk to her, of course.

772
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:12,822
Hang in there.

773
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:26,302
JASON AND WAITERS:
♪ And stuff yourself
with shrimp galore ♪

774
00:43:26,304 --> 00:43:29,706
♪ Lobster, clam
and crab and more ♪

775
00:43:29,708 --> 00:43:35,178
♪ You'll overdose
on lobster tail, so... ♪

776
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:37,313
♪ You forget you're
getting old as hell. ♪

777
00:43:37,315 --> 00:43:38,681
Happy birthday!

778
00:43:40,985 --> 00:43:42,819
(giggles)

779
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:51,260
What's this?

780
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:55,632
It's for your transfer.

781
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:00,770
(sighs)

782
00:44:02,172 --> 00:44:03,906
Now, wait a minute...

783
00:44:03,908 --> 00:44:06,309
Jason.

784
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:20,923
Hey.

785
00:44:20,925 --> 00:44:23,326
Hey.

786
00:44:31,802 --> 00:44:33,903
Um...

787
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,809
I'm done.

788
00:44:40,978 --> 00:44:43,946
With... with what?

789
00:44:43,948 --> 00:44:46,249
With the job?

790
00:44:55,459 --> 00:44:57,894
With me?

791
00:44:57,896 --> 00:45:00,396
It's not right, Beck.

792
00:45:00,398 --> 00:45:02,932
None of it.

793
00:45:25,155 --> 00:45:27,757
BRANDON:
<i>Hey, I gotta get back</i>

794
00:45:27,759 --> 00:45:29,192
in a little while.
Mm.

795
00:45:29,194 --> 00:45:32,895
Another rousing evening
of Scrabble with Mom and Dad?

796
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:34,897
Jason wants to hang out.

797
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:36,032
With you?

798
00:45:36,034 --> 00:45:37,266
Yeah.

799
00:45:37,268 --> 00:45:39,302
Tonight?
Yeah.

800
00:45:39,304 --> 00:45:41,904
Were you going to maybe
fucking tell me?
Ah!

801
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:44,273
(laughs)

802
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:47,076
Wouldn't you rather
go out with him?

803
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:49,112
Not yet.
Come on,
I know you would.

804
00:45:49,114 --> 00:45:50,813
Why don't you
come with us?

805
00:45:50,815 --> 00:45:52,181
I... I'm not...

806
00:45:52,183 --> 00:45:54,150
ready to see him yet.

807
00:45:54,152 --> 00:45:56,385
So why the new outfit?

808
00:45:56,387 --> 00:45:58,321
It's for when I am.

809
00:45:58,323 --> 00:46:02,058
When you're ready?

810
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:04,127
You know full well that
I'm not the kind of person....

811
00:46:04,129 --> 00:46:06,395
But that's what
everyone thinks.

812
00:46:06,397 --> 00:46:08,464
It's what everyone thinks.

813
00:46:08,466 --> 00:46:13,269
Until they do the thing they
think they'd never, ever do.

814
00:46:15,372 --> 00:46:18,007
Does Graham know
you're here?

815
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:27,116
Okay, in
all honesty,

816
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:30,820
tell me what you
really think of Graham.

817
00:46:30,822 --> 00:46:31,954
In all honesty?

818
00:46:31,956 --> 00:46:33,556
Yeah.

819
00:46:33,558 --> 00:46:36,492
He's good.

820
00:46:36,494 --> 00:46:38,194
Good?

821
00:46:38,196 --> 00:46:41,464
Okay, I was
a little surprised

822
00:46:41,466 --> 00:46:44,066
when first you told me
you were engaged.

823
00:46:44,068 --> 00:46:46,135
I mean, it had nothing
to do with Graham.

824
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:47,837
I just... I don't know.

825
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:50,840
I didn't expect you
to settle down so quickly.

826
00:46:52,442 --> 00:46:55,978
Settle down or just settle?

827
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:58,514
WOMAN:
Emmie?

828
00:46:58,516 --> 00:47:00,516
I'm going
to the bookstore.
(mouthing)

829
00:47:00,518 --> 00:47:02,451
Emmie Carey.

830
00:47:02,453 --> 00:47:04,153
Tami Beck.
Yeah! Yeah.

831
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:06,856
Come here, cutie!
You look so good!

832
00:47:06,858 --> 00:47:08,024
Thank you.
Yeah.

833
00:47:08,026 --> 00:47:09,392
Yeah, you, too.

834
00:47:09,394 --> 00:47:10,993
You know what, it's actually
Tami Ayers now, yeah.

835
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:13,196
At first it was Beck,
and then it was Highsmith.

836
00:47:13,198 --> 00:47:15,131
Now it's Ayers, so... Yeah.
Yeah. Wow.

837
00:47:15,133 --> 00:47:16,332
You look awesome!

838
00:47:16,334 --> 00:47:17,600
Yeah.
Thank you. You, too.

839
00:47:17,602 --> 00:47:19,402
Thank you.
Yeah, yeah.
Buying some stuff?

840
00:47:19,404 --> 00:47:22,104
Yeah, really cute stuff.
Did you see this over there?

841
00:47:33,283 --> 00:47:35,885
Graham?

842
00:47:35,887 --> 00:47:38,521
Hey. It's Marty.

843
00:47:39,923 --> 00:47:41,924
(seagulls calling)

844
00:47:52,302 --> 00:47:54,070
<i>I thought Tommy and I were</i>

845
00:47:54,072 --> 00:47:55,571
perfect for each other,
you know.

846
00:47:55,573 --> 00:47:58,274
Not just because of the
whole "Tami/Tommy" thing either,

847
00:47:58,276 --> 00:47:59,876
even though that was
really fun.

848
00:47:59,878 --> 00:48:02,211
Um, but no, we had the same
tastes in

849
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:05,581
a lot of different things:
um, shoes.

850
00:48:05,583 --> 00:48:07,583
We're both really
into shoes big-time.

851
00:48:07,585 --> 00:48:09,185
We both loved
the same shows.

852
00:48:09,187 --> 00:48:10,620
That was
important to me.

853
00:48:10,622 --> 00:48:12,655
But I think, looking back,
that's how I knew

854
00:48:12,657 --> 00:48:16,292
that we were not really
on the same page anymore

855
00:48:16,294 --> 00:48:20,196
because I liked to
watch <i>Housewives,</i>

856
00:48:20,198 --> 00:48:21,497
and, um, Tommy didn't,
which is fine.

857
00:48:21,499 --> 00:48:23,399
He can have
his cable news shows.

858
00:48:23,401 --> 00:48:25,601
That's why God invented more
than one TV set.

859
00:48:25,603 --> 00:48:28,671
So we watch in different
rooms, no big deal.

860
00:48:28,673 --> 00:48:30,539
We had, like, seven
TVs in the house,

861
00:48:30,541 --> 00:48:32,241
you might as
well use 'em.

862
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:33,943
But the thing is,
we both like <i>Grey's.</i>

863
00:48:33,945 --> 00:48:36,312
And <i>Grey's</i> comes on
right after <i>Housewives</i>

864
00:48:36,314 --> 00:48:38,180
and right after Tommy's show.

865
00:48:38,182 --> 00:48:40,416
But instead of us watching
watching <i>Grey's</i> together

866
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:42,985
in the same room, we both just
ended up staying in

867
00:48:42,987 --> 00:48:46,656
separate rooms
to watch the same show.

868
00:48:46,658 --> 00:48:49,225
Which was nuts.
And neither of us
noticed for weeks.

869
00:48:49,227 --> 00:48:50,626
Once I figured out what

870
00:48:50,628 --> 00:48:54,497
was going on, I kind of was,
like, "Oh, this is bad.

871
00:48:54,499 --> 00:48:56,232
Yeah, this is bad.
We're doomed."

872
00:48:56,234 --> 00:48:59,068
But it's okay. Things were
really getting stale anyway

873
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:00,536
up to that point, so...

874
00:49:00,538 --> 00:49:02,438
Well, what did you do?

875
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:05,174
Divorce.
That's what I'm talking about.

876
00:49:05,176 --> 00:49:06,375
Wow. God.

877
00:49:06,377 --> 00:49:08,377
You didn't try anything first?

878
00:49:08,379 --> 00:49:09,478
What do you mean?

879
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:11,113
Like, I don't know,
counseling

880
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:12,548
or something like that.

881
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:15,217
No, no, we thought about it.
But no, life is too short.

882
00:49:15,219 --> 00:49:16,652
And plus it's worked out.

883
00:49:16,654 --> 00:49:19,221
I'm with Mark and I love him.
He's awesome.

884
00:49:19,223 --> 00:49:20,389
Yeah, he's amazing.

885
00:49:20,391 --> 00:49:21,657
That's great.
Yeah, it is.

886
00:49:21,659 --> 00:49:23,392
But what about you?
How's your hubby?

887
00:49:23,394 --> 00:49:25,461
How's your old man?

888
00:49:25,463 --> 00:49:27,129
Well, you're
married, right?

889
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:28,331
No.
No?

890
00:49:28,333 --> 00:49:29,532
Somebody told me you...
I am.

891
00:49:29,534 --> 00:49:31,167
I thought you
were married.

892
00:49:31,169 --> 00:49:32,368
I am.
You are?

893
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:35,504
I thought so!
It's like, "What, what?" Yeah.

894
00:49:35,506 --> 00:49:36,973
Sorry about that.

895
00:49:36,975 --> 00:49:41,143
Didn't Meredith
and Tory Cage get married

896
00:49:41,145 --> 00:49:42,411
a couple years ago?

897
00:49:42,413 --> 00:49:44,246
Yeah. Divorced.
(phone chimes)

898
00:49:44,248 --> 00:49:46,148
Excuse me.
I don't mean to be rude.

899
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:48,551
Mm-hmm, yeah.
I've been waiting for a call
from my brother.

900
00:49:48,553 --> 00:49:50,119
But I've been doing
all the talking.

901
00:49:50,121 --> 00:49:51,420
Tell me about yourself.

902
00:49:51,422 --> 00:49:53,622
You're the one
who lives in
the Big Apple.

903
00:49:53,624 --> 00:49:55,524
I want to hear
about city life.

904
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:01,464
Come on, come on,
come on.
Not a lot, really.

905
00:50:01,466 --> 00:50:03,065
There's got to be
some crazy stories.

906
00:50:03,067 --> 00:50:05,034
It's the city.
The city that never sleeps.

907
00:50:24,421 --> 00:50:26,355
You know what
your mom calls me.

908
00:50:26,357 --> 00:50:28,424
The best lay
north of Boston.

909
00:50:28,426 --> 00:50:30,226
(chuckles)

910
00:50:30,228 --> 00:50:33,162
Well...

911
00:50:33,164 --> 00:50:34,630
she used to, son.

912
00:50:34,632 --> 00:50:37,466
(chuckles)
She used to.

913
00:50:37,468 --> 00:50:42,271
No. She calls me an enabler.

914
00:50:43,607 --> 00:50:45,341
Now, every time
I've covered your rent

915
00:50:45,343 --> 00:50:46,575
or bailed you out
of debt,

916
00:50:46,577 --> 00:50:50,079
it's always been because
I want my son

917
00:50:50,081 --> 00:50:52,314
to have every chance
to follow his dreams.

918
00:50:52,316 --> 00:50:53,482
Okay, all right, Dad.

919
00:50:53,484 --> 00:50:55,217
But you know,
it's not like

920
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:58,154
you just give me money,
like a handout or something.

921
00:50:58,156 --> 00:51:00,523
Jesus, how many friggin'
pictures of frogs

922
00:51:00,525 --> 00:51:04,260
do you think we need
in the house?

923
00:51:07,097 --> 00:51:09,231
All right, look, um,
I'll pay you back.

924
00:51:09,233 --> 00:51:11,500
You know I'll pay you
back when something...

925
00:51:11,502 --> 00:51:15,071
You know what?
I had dreams, too.

926
00:51:15,073 --> 00:51:19,341
You may find that
hard to believe, but I did.

927
00:51:19,343 --> 00:51:21,377
I have supported you

928
00:51:21,379 --> 00:51:25,147
because I always defend your
right to be what you want

929
00:51:25,149 --> 00:51:27,450
because I love you
and believe in you,

930
00:51:27,452 --> 00:51:30,719
and I want you to have
everything you want.

931
00:51:30,721 --> 00:51:35,191
I know what
you're capable of.

932
00:51:35,193 --> 00:51:37,693
It's just that it's hard
to blame Mom, you know?

933
00:51:37,695 --> 00:51:40,329
Because at some point
we'd like to be able

934
00:51:40,331 --> 00:51:42,598
to see you take care
of yourself.

935
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:46,268
To see all your dedication
come to fruition.

936
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:48,437
Well, look, I know that

937
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:51,841
something is going to happen
soon. I know it.

938
00:51:51,843 --> 00:51:54,410
I can feel it.

939
00:52:00,317 --> 00:52:01,717
(sighs)

940
00:52:04,154 --> 00:52:05,721
This is a new one.

941
00:52:05,723 --> 00:52:07,456
Your mother doesn't
know about it

942
00:52:07,458 --> 00:52:08,824
and she doesn't have to.

943
00:52:08,826 --> 00:52:10,359
Okay.

944
00:52:10,361 --> 00:52:11,560
Don't abuse it, okay?

945
00:52:11,562 --> 00:52:13,262
I won't.
I won't.

946
00:52:13,264 --> 00:52:14,630
Necessities only.

947
00:52:17,567 --> 00:52:21,570
Um... what about...?

948
00:52:21,572 --> 00:52:23,839
Oh, I'll send Gary rent
for the next three months.

949
00:52:23,841 --> 00:52:25,908
By then, who knows?
Maybe you'll be

950
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:29,879
the Thomas Kinkade
of amphibian paintings.

951
00:52:31,248 --> 00:52:33,649
Thanks, Dad.

952
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:35,551
BRANDON:
<i>How long have you been</i>

953
00:52:35,553 --> 00:52:37,219
holding onto
that stuff?

954
00:52:37,221 --> 00:52:39,722
(sighs)

955
00:52:39,724 --> 00:52:42,491
Most of it since
high school.

956
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:44,627
But he's sent me
a ton of stuff

957
00:52:44,629 --> 00:52:46,195
in New York
over the years.

958
00:52:46,197 --> 00:52:50,733
And when I come home,
I... I bring it with me

959
00:52:50,735 --> 00:52:53,369
and I leave it here.

960
00:52:59,209 --> 00:53:01,877
Like the letters.
Are these postcards?

961
00:53:01,879 --> 00:53:03,679
Yeah.

962
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:06,882
They're not places
he's ever been, but...

963
00:53:06,884 --> 00:53:10,219
they're places he
wants to take me.

964
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:15,457
What's that?

965
00:53:15,459 --> 00:53:19,428
This came two days
before my wedding.

966
00:53:24,501 --> 00:53:26,302
(chuckles)

967
00:53:30,507 --> 00:53:32,374
Wow.

968
00:53:34,978 --> 00:53:39,248
This must have
kind of fucked with you, huh?

969
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:42,585
I shit you not,

970
00:53:42,587 --> 00:53:44,486
I thought that Jason
was gonna show up

971
00:53:44,488 --> 00:53:47,523
at the wedding and...

972
00:53:47,525 --> 00:53:50,926
He was always
that passionate,

973
00:53:50,928 --> 00:53:55,631
throw-caution-to-the-wind
kind of person, you know?

974
00:53:55,633 --> 00:53:59,468
That would have been terrible,
right?

975
00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:02,338
If he showed up?

976
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:03,772
Em?

977
00:54:03,774 --> 00:54:05,708
You have to promise that
you're not gonna say

978
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:06,875
anything about me, right?

979
00:54:06,877 --> 00:54:09,278
I want it to be a surprise.

980
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,412
Just meet us there.

981
00:54:10,414 --> 00:54:11,580
No! No, no,
no, no, no.

982
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:12,748
It has to be right.

983
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:14,283
It's got to be perfect.

984
00:54:14,285 --> 00:54:15,451
(vehicle approaches)

985
00:54:15,453 --> 00:54:17,586
I think he's here.

986
00:54:17,588 --> 00:54:20,289
Huh.
Oh, no.

987
00:54:20,291 --> 00:54:21,624
BOTH:
It's Grandma's boyfriend.

988
00:54:21,626 --> 00:54:23,359
(both chuckle)

989
00:54:23,361 --> 00:54:24,526
What is he like?

990
00:54:24,528 --> 00:54:28,364
He looks like
80 million years old.

991
00:54:28,366 --> 00:54:30,733
Why doesn't he drop her off
in the driveway?

992
00:54:30,735 --> 00:54:31,867
I think he's blind.

993
00:54:31,869 --> 00:54:33,269
(vehicle approaches)

994
00:54:33,271 --> 00:54:34,436
Oh, shit.
What?

995
00:54:34,438 --> 00:54:35,738
Jason.
Oh, my God.

996
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:36,972
Uh, hand me the shades.

997
00:54:36,974 --> 00:54:38,807
Are you sure they're
not in the car?

998
00:54:38,809 --> 00:54:40,442
No, I know
I brought them in.

999
00:54:40,444 --> 00:54:42,911
Hurry up and get them before
Mom and Dad see him! Go!

1000
00:54:42,913 --> 00:54:44,713
Okay, sorry, sorry. I'm trying.
Go, go, go!

1001
00:54:44,715 --> 00:54:46,582
I'm trying!
Fuck it.
You don't need 'em.

1002
00:54:46,584 --> 00:54:47,950
Yes, I do.
What if I start...?

1003
00:54:47,952 --> 00:54:50,052
Could you just suck it up
for once. Jesus.

1004
00:54:50,054 --> 00:54:51,587
(door opens,
indistinct conversation nearby)

1005
00:54:51,589 --> 00:54:54,857
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

1006
00:54:54,859 --> 00:54:56,659
Brandon, I'm sorry.

1007
00:54:56,661 --> 00:54:59,762
I'm doing this for you.
I know. I'm sorry.

1008
00:54:59,764 --> 00:55:01,997
Okay...
Go, go, go.

1009
00:55:01,999 --> 00:55:04,967
Remember everything he says
so you can tell me, okay?

1010
00:55:04,969 --> 00:55:07,336
JASON:
Is Emmie here, by any chance?

1011
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:11,573
MARTY:
You didn't tell us
you were going out.

1012
00:55:11,575 --> 00:55:13,509
(door opens)
BRANDON: It's cool.
I'll be home soon.

1013
00:55:13,511 --> 00:55:15,577
JASON:
Nice to see you, Mr. Carey.

1014
00:55:15,579 --> 00:55:17,479
(door closes)

1015
00:55:17,481 --> 00:55:20,749
JASON:
Hey, guys.

1016
00:55:20,751 --> 00:55:22,484
Hey, fucknut,
how's it going?

1017
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:23,919
Hey, do you know Brandon, JP?

1018
00:55:23,921 --> 00:55:26,355
How's it going?
All right.

1019
00:55:26,357 --> 00:55:29,391
You're with that girl,
Shannon, right?

1020
00:55:29,393 --> 00:55:31,060
My bad, dude.

1021
00:55:31,062 --> 00:55:32,761
You guys were together
for a while,

1022
00:55:32,763 --> 00:55:35,664
practically married.

1023
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:37,499
Yeah.

1024
00:55:41,638 --> 00:55:44,773
And he is also a poet.

1025
00:55:44,775 --> 00:55:46,842
Get you two artistes
a couple of brews?

1026
00:55:46,844 --> 00:55:48,010
Sure. Two darks.

1027
00:55:48,012 --> 00:55:49,678
I'd rather get...
Ay, yi...

1028
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,013
What?
So embarrassing.

1029
00:55:51,015 --> 00:55:55,517
Look... on the wall
behind the register.

1030
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:56,785
BRANDON:
Oh, wow, that's cool.

1031
00:55:56,787 --> 00:55:58,420
They... they let you hang
your stuff here?

1032
00:55:58,422 --> 00:56:00,489
Well, I mean, it's not like
they let me, you know?

1033
00:56:00,491 --> 00:56:04,526
I gave him a discount,
but I gotta make a living.

1034
00:56:04,528 --> 00:56:06,795
Uh!

1035
00:56:06,797 --> 00:56:09,031
Tab?
Mm-hmm.

1036
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:14,670
You know what?

1037
00:56:14,672 --> 00:56:16,638

00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:41,557
Don't you ever wonder "What if?"

1059
00:57:41,559 --> 00:57:42,825
I mean...

1060
00:57:42,827 --> 00:57:44,927
No.

1061
00:57:44,929 --> 00:57:47,196
Well, yeah, yeah, I used to.

1062
00:57:47,198 --> 00:57:51,800
But you can live your whole life
with "what if's."

1063
00:57:51,802 --> 00:57:53,502
It'll make you crazy.

1064
00:57:53,504 --> 00:57:57,172
I mean, don't you sooner
or later have to start

1065
00:57:57,174 --> 00:57:59,975
to relish the choices
that you made?

1066
00:57:59,977 --> 00:58:03,111
Like the choice
that you and Graham made.

1067
00:58:06,616 --> 00:58:11,086
I have been 27 different people
in the last 35 years.

1068
00:58:11,088 --> 00:58:12,754
People change, that's all.

1069
00:58:12,756 --> 00:58:14,656
It's not about that.

1070
00:58:14,658 --> 00:58:16,525
It's about...

1071
00:58:16,527 --> 00:58:17,726
(sighs)

1072
00:58:17,728 --> 00:58:19,761
It's about expectations.

1073
00:58:19,763 --> 00:58:21,263
It's about... Isn't it?

1074
00:58:21,265 --> 00:58:24,967
It's about letting
your expectations change.

1075
00:58:24,969 --> 00:58:28,270
Your idea
of-of how thing should be.

1076
00:58:29,939 --> 00:58:32,007
When I was in
the air force, we had

1077
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:34,843
these things called
cybernetic missiles, okay?

1078
00:58:34,845 --> 00:58:38,146
Now, when my dad was
in World War II,

1079
00:58:38,148 --> 00:58:39,848
he had ballistic missiles.

1080
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:41,116
You know the difference?

1081
00:58:42,252 --> 00:58:44,086
Good,
'cause I'm gonna tell you.

1082
00:58:44,088 --> 00:58:47,923
Ballistic missile,
you know the target,

1083
00:58:47,925 --> 00:58:49,925
you fired the ammo,

1084
00:58:49,927 --> 00:58:53,795
and it never changes course,
right?

1085
00:58:53,797 --> 00:58:55,664
Once a that thing leaves
the ground,

1086
00:58:55,666 --> 00:58:56,899
it's going to hit the spot

1087
00:58:56,901 --> 00:58:59,835
that you aimed it at
no matter what.

1088
00:58:59,837 --> 00:59:02,671
Now, the problem
with that is,

1089
00:59:02,673 --> 00:59:05,140
that the targets
got smart.

1090
00:59:05,142 --> 00:59:09,244
The targets learned to move,
and the missile didn't.

1091
00:59:09,246 --> 00:59:12,114
So, you fire the missile,
and that's all folks.

1092
00:59:12,116 --> 00:59:13,849
I mean,
it's gonna hit something,

1093
00:59:13,851 --> 00:59:16,251
but it isn't gonna hit the thing
that you aimed it at

1094
00:59:16,253 --> 00:59:18,820
because that's
not there anymore.

1095
00:59:18,822 --> 00:59:22,057
So, they invented
cybernetic missiles.

1096
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:24,626
Now, cybernetic missile,

1097
00:59:24,628 --> 00:59:26,628
you program it at launch,

1098
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:30,098
you let it go,
but if the target moves,

1099
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:33,135
the missile changes course.

1100
00:59:33,137 --> 00:59:37,239
And it's constantly calculating
and recalculating

1101
00:59:37,241 --> 00:59:41,009
and changing course
to stay with the target

1102
00:59:41,011 --> 00:59:42,711
no matter what.

1103
00:59:42,713 --> 00:59:45,314
It knows its ultimate goal.

1104
00:59:45,316 --> 00:59:49,318
It has no idea what it's going
to take to get there.

1105
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:53,855
It has no idea how difficult
the target is going to make it.

1106
00:59:53,857 --> 00:59:58,060
All it knows is it's committed

1107
00:59:58,062 --> 01:00:01,763
to making whatever adjustments
are necessary

1108
01:00:01,765 --> 01:00:05,634
to reach that object.

1109
01:00:07,136 --> 01:00:11,640
Have you and Mom
always been faithful?

1110
01:00:11,642 --> 01:00:13,909
Yeah.

1111
01:00:13,911 --> 01:00:16,979
We've been lucky that way.

1112
01:00:16,981 --> 01:00:21,883
Neither of us ever crossed
that line.

1113
01:00:21,885 --> 01:00:24,286
How is that luck?

1114
01:00:26,723 --> 01:00:28,890
Here.

1115
01:00:28,892 --> 01:00:31,927
You're a chip off the old block.

1116
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:47,743
Do you ever...

1117
01:00:47,745 --> 01:00:51,780
Do you ever wonder if things
are going to work out?

1118
01:00:51,782 --> 01:00:54,149
Your art stuff?

1119
01:00:55,818 --> 01:00:57,185
Not at all.

1120
01:00:57,187 --> 01:01:00,022
I-I know it will.

1121
01:01:00,024 --> 01:01:02,858
H-How-how do you know?

1122
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:05,694
It has to.

1123
01:01:05,696 --> 01:01:07,929
I got nothing else.

1124
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:14,436
I'm not like the other kids
I went to college with.

1125
01:01:14,438 --> 01:01:18,306
You know, the artists
and actors and shit.

1126
01:01:20,943 --> 01:01:23,345
They all grew up

1127
01:01:23,347 --> 01:01:26,014
thinking they had
some God-given right

1128
01:01:26,016 --> 01:01:29,451
to be famous or
successful or whatever.

1129
01:01:29,453 --> 01:01:32,988
Like, they saw
it on the tube,

1130
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:34,723
so, you know,

1131
01:01:34,725 --> 01:01:37,025
they just assumed that's what
their life would be like.

1132
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:40,896
Well, I guess I did the same
thing at a certain point, but...

1133
01:01:44,133 --> 01:01:46,268
I don't know.

1134
01:01:46,270 --> 01:01:48,437
Everyone else just
eventually got depressed

1135
01:01:48,439 --> 01:01:50,272
and gave up.

1136
01:01:50,274 --> 01:01:53,341
But I realized
that it was gonna

1137
01:01:53,343 --> 01:01:56,144
take hard work
and sacrifice,

1138
01:01:56,146 --> 01:01:58,747
and nothing was gonna
be handed to me.

1139
01:01:58,749 --> 01:02:02,484
Yeah, but that doesn't
necessarily...

1140
01:02:02,486 --> 01:02:05,887
Like, that doesn't mean
it's gonna happen.

1141
01:02:05,889 --> 01:02:07,489
Fuck you, man.

1142
01:02:07,491 --> 01:02:10,425
Yeah, it does.

1143
01:02:10,427 --> 01:02:14,229
Sure, I figured it probably
would have happened by now,

1144
01:02:14,231 --> 01:02:17,399
but, you know, I felt that
way about a lot of things.

1145
01:02:24,974 --> 01:02:27,509
What the fuck are we doing here?

1146
01:02:29,011 --> 01:02:31,913
What the fuck
is this place?

1147
01:02:31,915 --> 01:02:33,782
You ever been here?

1148
01:02:33,784 --> 01:02:35,450
No.

1149
01:02:35,452 --> 01:02:38,120
I don't think
I knew it was here.

1150
01:02:38,122 --> 01:02:41,857
Well, this is where
I come to...

1151
01:02:41,859 --> 01:02:44,059
think.

1152
01:02:44,061 --> 01:02:46,027
Think?

1153
01:02:46,029 --> 01:02:47,863
About what?

1154
01:02:47,865 --> 01:02:49,064
Shit.

1155
01:02:49,066 --> 01:02:51,266
Everything.

1156
01:02:53,302 --> 01:02:56,071
Your sister, for example.

1157
01:02:56,073 --> 01:02:59,074
(tsking)

1158
01:02:59,076 --> 01:03:02,410
(singsongy):
My sister's married.

1159
01:03:02,412 --> 01:03:04,246
Really?

1160
01:03:04,248 --> 01:03:06,114
Yeah, my sister's married.

1161
01:03:06,116 --> 01:03:08,517
No shit.

1162
01:03:12,388 --> 01:03:15,157
Dude, come on, this is
the best you can do?

1163
01:03:15,159 --> 01:03:17,092
All the immaculate
coastline around here

1164
01:03:17,094 --> 01:03:18,493
and you come to this
shitty reservoir?

1165
01:03:18,495 --> 01:03:21,163
Look, everybody else,
they-they want the shore.

1166
01:03:21,165 --> 01:03:23,165
They can have it.

1167
01:03:23,167 --> 01:03:25,333
But this place...

1168
01:03:25,335 --> 01:03:28,236
This is me and Emmie's.

1169
01:03:28,238 --> 01:03:30,372
It's your special place?

1170
01:03:30,374 --> 01:03:32,407
Yeah, it is.
(chuckles)

1171
01:03:32,409 --> 01:03:35,377
Dude, that, uh...
(laughs)

1172
01:03:35,379 --> 01:03:39,114
That, uh, parody
of   <i>The Graduat</i>with the frogs,

1173
01:03:39,116 --> 01:03:41,983
that's some
classic shit.

1174
01:03:41,985 --> 01:03:44,386
It's fucking hilarious.

1175
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:48,924
Let me ask you something.

1176
01:03:48,926 --> 01:03:50,525
Would you be willing

1177
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:53,595
to give up frogs for her?

1178
01:03:55,298 --> 01:03:57,098
Well, I don't just paint frogs.

1179
01:03:57,100 --> 01:04:01,236
I mean, it's my primary subject,
but I, you know...

1180
01:04:01,238 --> 01:04:04,306
You'd give up your
life's work for her?

1181
01:04:04,308 --> 01:04:08,243
Well, she would never ask me
to give up my work.

1182
01:04:08,245 --> 01:04:10,445
No matter
what age I am,

1183
01:04:10,447 --> 01:04:13,982
or-or how much money
I don't have or if...

1184
01:04:13,984 --> 01:04:15,917
I still lived in the same
shithole I lived in

1185
01:04:15,919 --> 01:04:18,887
when I graduated from school,
she would never do that.

1186
01:04:18,889 --> 01:04:21,289
She would encourage me
to keep at it

1187
01:04:21,291 --> 01:04:23,859
for as long as I needed to,
no matter what.

1188
01:04:23,861 --> 01:04:27,295
And she would believe
that one day, it would pay off.

1189
01:04:27,297 --> 01:04:29,331
She's different.

1190
01:04:29,333 --> 01:04:32,133
No.
She's different
than she was when you knew her.

1191
01:04:32,135 --> 01:04:33,902
No, she's not.
Of course she is.

1192
01:04:33,904 --> 01:04:35,403
I'm not.

1193
01:04:35,405 --> 01:04:37,072
And I believe
that she knows that.

1194
01:04:37,074 --> 01:04:38,573
How?

1195
01:04:38,575 --> 01:04:40,976
How?

1196
01:04:40,978 --> 01:04:43,111
Because I've been
sending her stuff, man.

1197
01:04:43,113 --> 01:04:44,379
I've been sending her cards

1198
01:04:44,381 --> 01:04:47,282
and postcards
and drawings and letters

1199
01:04:47,284 --> 01:04:50,185
ever since...
You broke up?

1200
01:04:50,187 --> 01:04:53,088
No, ever since she moved away.

1201
01:04:53,090 --> 01:04:56,491
We never broke up.

1202
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:03,098
(sighs)

1203
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:13,174
I admire you.

1204
01:05:13,176 --> 01:05:14,943
(laughs)

1205
01:05:14,945 --> 01:05:17,445
No, I'm serious.

1206
01:05:17,447 --> 01:05:19,915
I'm serious,
I admire you, Jason.

1207
01:05:19,917 --> 01:05:23,051
For not giving up.

1208
01:05:23,053 --> 01:05:27,088
I wish I hadn't quit,
but I did long ago.

1209
01:05:28,224 --> 01:05:30,458
What did you quit?

1210
01:05:32,962 --> 01:05:35,163
I don't remember.

1211
01:05:40,403 --> 01:05:43,038
Something...

1212
01:05:45,641 --> 01:05:48,209
Something great.

1213
01:05:48,211 --> 01:05:51,046
I think.

1214
01:05:53,983 --> 01:05:56,217
(sniffles, crying)

1215
01:06:01,657 --> 01:06:04,359
Sweetheart?

1216
01:06:04,361 --> 01:06:07,095
These letters,
this is not you and Mom.

1217
01:06:07,097 --> 01:06:08,396
Dad, this isn't you.

1218
01:06:08,398 --> 01:06:09,998
Who do you think wrote them?

1219
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,132
Of course it's us.

1220
01:06:11,134 --> 01:06:12,434
I don't know these people.

1221
01:06:12,436 --> 01:06:14,569
I don't know.

1222
01:06:14,571 --> 01:06:17,539
It was a long time ago.

1223
01:06:17,541 --> 01:06:20,075
There's still some
of that in us.

1224
01:06:20,077 --> 01:06:22,243
GAIL:
What's going on?

1225
01:06:22,245 --> 01:06:25,246
These letters, I mean...

1226
01:06:25,248 --> 01:06:28,183
You and Dad,
you were so in love.

1227
01:06:28,185 --> 01:06:30,285
You were so passionate.

1228
01:06:30,287 --> 01:06:31,586
What happened to these people?

1229
01:06:31,588 --> 01:06:32,754
They're crazy
about each other.

1230
01:06:32,756 --> 01:06:34,322
(banging on door)
I mean...

1231
01:06:34,324 --> 01:06:36,358
I'm not crying!

1232
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:38,493
Christ.

1233
01:06:38,495 --> 01:06:41,429
BRANDON:
I'm not crying.

1234
01:06:41,431 --> 01:06:42,630
Hey, Mama.

1235
01:06:42,632 --> 01:06:44,199
Look, I'm not crying.

1236
01:06:44,201 --> 01:06:46,501
Get in here; come on, inside.
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1237
01:06:46,503 --> 01:06:48,370
Dad, look, I'm not crying.
Hi, Mrs. Carey.

1238
01:06:48,372 --> 01:06:49,637
Yeah, I see that. Come on.

1239
01:06:49,639 --> 01:06:51,172
I think he might be
a little drunk.

1240
01:06:51,174 --> 01:06:53,041
GAIL:
You took him out?

1241
01:06:53,043 --> 01:06:54,175
JASON:
Well, yeah.

1242
01:06:54,177 --> 01:06:56,044
Um, is Emmie here,
by any chance?

1243
01:06:56,046 --> 01:06:58,380
Have you...
Why the hell would
you take him drinking?

1244
01:06:58,382 --> 01:06:59,748
It's so good to see you.

1245
01:06:59,750 --> 01:07:02,117
Well, it started out
as just a couple of beers.

1246
01:07:02,119 --> 01:07:03,685
See?
What do you say you go
to your room, son?

1247
01:07:03,687 --> 01:07:05,587
No, no, I'm good, I'm
good. I'm not dru...

1248
01:07:05,589 --> 01:07:07,455
I'm not even drunk.
GAIL:
He's not supposed to drink.

1249
01:07:07,457 --> 01:07:09,691
He's wasted...
He's not supposed to drink?

1250
01:07:09,693 --> 01:07:12,127
Brandon is not supposed
to be drinking.

1251
01:07:12,129 --> 01:07:14,129
I didn't know that
and I apologize.
"Brandon is no supposed

1252
01:07:14,131 --> 01:07:15,497
to be drinking."
Marty...

1253
01:07:15,499 --> 01:07:18,299
"Brandon is not supposed
to be drinking."

1254
01:07:18,301 --> 01:07:19,434
Marty, would you please

1255
01:07:19,436 --> 01:07:22,604
shut him up?

1256
01:07:22,606 --> 01:07:24,472
Hey, that's enough.
But it's okay, I'm fine.

1257
01:07:24,474 --> 01:07:26,508
That's enough. I know.
I'm just playing.

1258
01:07:26,510 --> 01:07:30,311
BRANDON: I was just...
GAIL: She's not here, Jason.

1259
01:07:30,313 --> 01:07:32,480
Well, I...

1260
01:07:32,482 --> 01:07:35,316
I saw a car
with New York plates.

1261
01:07:35,318 --> 01:07:37,585
Brandon...
Brandon, hey! Hey!

1262
01:07:37,587 --> 01:07:39,054
I'd really like
you to leave.

1263
01:07:39,056 --> 01:07:40,155
Okay, well...

1264
01:07:40,157 --> 01:07:42,123
That's enough.
That is e-fucking-nough.

1265
01:07:42,125 --> 01:07:43,691
Do you hear me?
GAIL: I really would like...

1266
01:07:43,693 --> 01:07:45,226
That is enough!
Hey, Emmie.

1267
01:07:45,228 --> 01:07:46,361
Emmie.
Is she... Okay.

1268
01:07:46,363 --> 01:07:47,395
No, she's not here.

1269
01:07:47,397 --> 01:07:48,563
Listen, listen, I just...

1270
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:50,231
I need you
to just give her something.

1271
01:07:50,233 --> 01:07:52,400
Emmie, come on, Emmie.
Brandon, stop
it. Stop it.

1272
01:07:52,402 --> 01:07:54,836
There you are; there she is,
there she is.
If you give this to her,

1273
01:07:54,838 --> 01:07:57,105
I will leave.
I will leave.
I... you're going to leave.

1274
01:07:57,107 --> 01:07:59,174
Okay, Emmie, I'm gonna
leave something for you.
One way or another...

1275
01:07:59,176 --> 01:08:00,341
BRANDON:
Emmie, Emmie.

1276
01:08:00,343 --> 01:08:03,144
(door closes)
Come on. Emmie. What?

1277
01:08:03,146 --> 01:08:05,180
What?

1278
01:08:05,182 --> 01:08:07,649
Come...

1279
01:08:07,651 --> 01:08:10,218
(chuckles)
Now you're crying.

1280
01:08:10,220 --> 01:08:11,719
But I'm not crying.

1281
01:08:11,721 --> 01:08:14,255
GAIL:
Brandon, go to your room.

1282
01:08:14,257 --> 01:08:16,624
It's not my room,
it's Emmie's room.

1283
01:08:16,626 --> 01:08:18,593
Grandma has mine, remember?
Brandon,

1284
01:08:18,595 --> 01:08:22,397
please, it's bedtime.

1285
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:24,699
I'm not a little kid!

1286
01:08:24,701 --> 01:08:28,336
GAIL: You force us
to treat you like one.

1287
01:08:31,373 --> 01:08:33,374
You're unhappy?

1288
01:08:33,376 --> 01:08:34,576
What do you have

1289
01:08:34,578 --> 01:08:37,278
to be unhappy about?

1290
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:40,148
What the fuck do you have
to be unhappy about?

1291
01:08:40,150 --> 01:08:41,282
Hey!
Huh?
Brandon!

1292
01:08:41,284 --> 01:08:43,284
Cut it out.

1293
01:08:43,286 --> 01:08:46,621
I got a reason
to be unhappy.

1294
01:08:49,158 --> 01:08:51,292
I got nothing.

1295
01:08:51,294 --> 01:08:53,394
My life is shit.

1296
01:08:53,396 --> 01:08:54,629
It's shit.

1297
01:08:54,631 --> 01:08:56,564
But you're so unhappy
with your life,

1298
01:08:56,566 --> 01:08:59,634
you got to come here
and live some fantasy?

1299
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:03,338
Just tell me what the fuck you
have to be so unhappy about?

1300
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:04,405
MARTY:
Brandon.

1301
01:09:04,407 --> 01:09:06,574
Tell me what the fuck you have

1302
01:09:06,576 --> 01:09:08,510
to be so unhappy about?!

1303
01:09:08,512 --> 01:09:10,745
Brandon, I...
Tell me what the fuck you have

1304
01:09:10,747 --> 01:09:12,480
to be so unhappy about!
Brandon!

1305
01:09:12,482 --> 01:09:14,582
MARTY:
Brandon, I am serious.

1306
01:09:14,584 --> 01:09:16,518
You calm down right now.
Just tell me. Tell me.

1307
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:18,219
Right now!
Tell me. Tell me.

1308
01:09:27,863 --> 01:09:29,864
(hits wall)

1309
01:09:34,570 --> 01:09:36,304
(sniffling)

1310
01:09:37,873 --> 01:09:40,441
I mean, you got
everything.

1311
01:09:42,778 --> 01:09:47,382
You got your own
business, your own life.

1312
01:09:47,384 --> 01:09:50,351
You got Graham.

1313
01:09:50,353 --> 01:09:53,454
You got the fuck
out of here.

1314
01:09:53,456 --> 01:09:55,423
But it's not enough?

1315
01:09:58,260 --> 01:10:01,296
You expect more?

1316
01:10:01,298 --> 01:10:02,463
You need more?

1317
01:10:02,465 --> 01:10:04,766
(sniffling)

1318
01:10:04,768 --> 01:10:08,436
Everyone disappoints,
huh, jerky?

1319
01:10:12,741 --> 01:10:14,909
Hey, I'm not crying.

1320
01:10:14,911 --> 01:10:17,378
No.

1321
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:19,347
But I will tomorrow.

1322
01:10:22,518 --> 01:10:24,485
(sighs)

1323
01:10:29,658 --> 01:10:32,594
(door opens)

1324
01:10:32,596 --> 01:10:34,829
Oh. Hi.

1325
01:10:34,831 --> 01:10:36,297
What's wrong, Mom?

1326
01:10:36,299 --> 01:10:38,266
I'm so pleased
you're both here.

1327
01:10:38,268 --> 01:10:40,635
Just-just let me speak, Gail.

1328
01:10:40,637 --> 01:10:43,638
There's something
I need to say to both of you,

1329
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:47,242
and it's very hard.

1330
01:10:47,244 --> 01:10:49,010
Have a seat.

1331
01:10:53,382 --> 01:10:56,751
I'm not proud of this.

1332
01:10:56,753 --> 01:11:00,822
I'm not proud
of myself one bit.

1333
01:11:00,824 --> 01:11:04,826
But I can't keep
running around in secrecy

1334
01:11:04,828 --> 01:11:07,328
like a little teenybopper.

1335
01:11:07,330 --> 01:11:10,431
I'm...

1336
01:11:10,433 --> 01:11:12,500
I'm going steady.

1337
01:11:14,570 --> 01:11:16,271
With a man.

1338
01:11:16,273 --> 01:11:19,907
And have been
for several months.

1339
01:11:19,909 --> 01:11:22,510
Evelyn, we've all known...

1340
01:11:22,512 --> 01:11:24,412
Marty.

1341
01:11:24,414 --> 01:11:27,382
I know that it feels like
a betrayal right now,

1342
01:11:27,384 --> 01:11:29,317
but hopefully with time...

1343
01:11:29,319 --> 01:11:32,020
Mom, don't you know that
we'd be happy for you?

1344
01:11:32,022 --> 01:11:34,555
Well, I can't imagine
you'd forgive me

1345
01:11:34,557 --> 01:11:37,692
for cheating on your father.

1346
01:11:37,694 --> 01:11:41,296
Daddy's been dead
for over 15 years.

1347
01:11:41,298 --> 01:11:44,465
EVELYN:
Jack will never
replace Edward for me,

1348
01:11:44,467 --> 01:11:48,469
and I don't expect him
to do that for you.

1349
01:11:48,471 --> 01:11:50,705
We understand, Mom.

1350
01:11:50,707 --> 01:11:53,074
You do?

1351
01:11:53,076 --> 01:11:54,742
Oh.

1352
01:11:54,744 --> 01:11:58,646
Oh, thank you.

1353
01:11:58,648 --> 01:12:00,715
I can't believe
this is happening.

1354
01:12:00,717 --> 01:12:01,816
MARTY:
Evelyn,

1355
01:12:01,818 --> 01:12:03,685
we're happy for you.
(chuckles)

1356
01:12:03,687 --> 01:12:05,653
Does he make
you happy?

1357
01:12:05,655 --> 01:12:09,090
Oh, he does.

1358
01:12:09,092 --> 01:12:12,794
And I know this is

1359
01:12:12,796 --> 01:12:18,466
a lot all at once, but
Jack's waiting right outside.

1360
01:12:18,468 --> 01:12:22,570
And, if you want, I'd like
to introduce him to you.

1361
01:12:22,572 --> 01:12:24,572
Please do.

1362
01:12:26,875 --> 01:12:29,610
Oh, my God,
what a night.

1363
01:12:29,612 --> 01:12:31,045
(sighs)

1364
01:12:31,047 --> 01:12:33,581
My dears...
(chuckles)

1365
01:12:33,583 --> 01:12:35,817
this is Jack Davison.

1366
01:12:35,819 --> 01:12:38,586
Well, it's a pleasure
to meet all of you.

1367
01:12:38,588 --> 01:12:41,689
My lady-friend here
has told me just

1368
01:12:41,691 --> 01:12:43,725
wonderful things
about all of you.

1369
01:12:43,727 --> 01:12:45,793
Very pleased to
meet you, Jack.

1370
01:12:45,795 --> 01:12:46,794
Welcome, Jack.

1371
01:12:46,796 --> 01:12:48,730
Hi, Jack.
Oh.

1372
01:12:48,732 --> 01:12:50,598
You must be Emmie?

1373
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:51,099
Yeah.

1374
01:12:55,404 --> 01:12:57,872
What's this?

1375
01:13:03,078 --> 01:13:05,046
(sniffing)

1376
01:13:23,732 --> 01:13:25,900
(sighs)

1377
01:14:01,203 --> 01:14:03,571
WOMAN:
<i>When's the last time you had</i>

1378
01:14:03,573 --> 01:14:04,839
your hair done, hon?

1379
01:14:04,841 --> 01:14:06,774
It's been a pretty long time.

1380
01:14:06,776 --> 01:14:08,009
Yeah.

1381
01:14:08,011 --> 01:14:12,180
So, uh, this is for
something special?

1382
01:14:12,182 --> 01:14:13,848
I think so.

1383
01:14:13,850 --> 01:14:14,982
(chuckles):
Ooh.

1384
01:14:14,984 --> 01:14:17,018
Got to hear
about that.

1385
01:14:46,915 --> 01:14:49,050
♪

1386
01:15:05,934 --> 01:15:08,202
There you go.

1387
01:15:08,204 --> 01:15:09,036
Thank you.

1388
01:15:09,038 --> 01:15:10,671
Hope it's enough.

1389
01:15:10,673 --> 01:15:12,673
If that don't do you,
I don't know what will.

1390
01:15:12,675 --> 01:15:16,010
Cash or credit?

1391
01:15:16,012 --> 01:15:18,145
Uh, credit, actually.

1392
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:23,150
(sighs)

1393
01:15:29,758 --> 01:15:32,894
It's a beautiful day,
isn't it?

1394
01:15:32,896 --> 01:15:35,630
I suppose it is.

1395
01:16:00,689 --> 01:16:02,256
GAIL (in distance):
Em?

1396
01:16:02,258 --> 01:16:03,090
Yeah?

1397
01:16:03,092 --> 01:16:04,258
Brandon, Dad and I

1398
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:06,594
are going to go have
dinner in Wiscasset.

1399
01:16:06,596 --> 01:16:07,595
Okay.

1400
01:16:07,597 --> 01:16:08,696
You want to come?

1401
01:16:08,698 --> 01:16:10,331
No. No, thanks.

1402
01:16:10,333 --> 01:16:13,267
We'll probably be home
around 9:00, 9:30.

1403
01:16:13,269 --> 01:16:15,836
All righty.

1404
01:16:15,838 --> 01:16:17,672
(door closes)

1405
01:16:39,795 --> 01:16:41,996
GRAHAM (over TV):
