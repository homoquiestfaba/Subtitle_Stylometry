1
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,478
How you doing?

2
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,181
I got it!

3
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:24,349
Pull up next to the limo.

4
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:49,858
- Natalie.
- Nice to see you.

5
00:01:51,627 --> 00:01:53,695
Pardon my incredulity,
natalie,

6
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:55,630
But I'm very surprised
to see you here-

7
00:01:55,631 --> 00:01:57,466
Pleasantly so, of course.

8
00:01:57,467 --> 00:01:58,834
I'm a little surprised

9
00:01:58,835 --> 00:02:01,035
To see myself here,
too, mary alice-

10
00:02:01,036 --> 00:02:03,489
Pleasantly so,
of course.

11
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,690
Were you here
last year?

12
00:02:05,691 --> 00:02:07,593
No. I wasn't
invited last year.

13
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:10,295
Oh. Curious.

14
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,197
That must have been
an accident.

15
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,303
Oh,
do you know libby?

16
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:19,854
No, I don't
believe I do.

17
00:02:19,855 --> 00:02:22,024
<i>Libby, this
is natalie standish.</i>

18
00:02:22,025 --> 00:02:24,025
Natalie is reed's-

19
00:02:24,026 --> 00:02:26,561
Oh, is it
all right to, um...

20
00:02:27,813 --> 00:02:29,615
Say that reed
got me pregnant

21
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:32,884
When I was a bar hop at your country
club, married me to avoid scandal,

22
00:02:32,885 --> 00:02:35,220
Spent the next 10 years
sucking the life out of me,

23
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:36,888
Got bored with me,
dumped me

24
00:02:36,889 --> 00:02:39,591
And screwed me in court?
Sure. Go ahead.

25
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:45,531
natalie is reed's ex-wife.

26
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:46,798
Oh.

27
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:48,700
Libby percy holt.

28
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:51,336
Natalie werjachewski
standish.

29
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:54,439
Well, are you
unescorted tonight?

30
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,241
No, I'm with someone.

31
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:58,710
A friend. Male.

32
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:01,696
Well... If the new
fella comes by,

33
00:03:01,697 --> 00:03:03,498
Be sure and point
him out to us.

34
00:03:03,499 --> 00:03:05,284
Oh, I don't think
I'll have to do that.

35
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:07,352
You'll know him
when you see him.

36
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:34,446
Oh, great! Aah!

37
00:03:41,103 --> 00:03:43,021
Go on!
Get out of here!

38
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:46,325
<i>Get off!</i>

39
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:53,932
feisty little guy.

40
00:04:16,305 --> 00:04:18,240
I don't care for caviar.

41
00:04:18,241 --> 00:04:20,041
I make it a rule
never to eat anything

42
00:04:20,042 --> 00:04:23,311
A fish deposits
in a riverbed. Right?

43
00:04:25,248 --> 00:04:27,649
It's been awfully nice
meeting you...

44
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:29,717
<i>- Dutch.
- Indeed.</i>

45
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:35,507
Nice meeting you.

46
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,579
Hi. I missed you.

47
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:00,014
Hello, natalie.

48
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:04,686
- Reed standish.
- Dutch dooley.

49
00:05:05,988 --> 00:05:08,256
You look... Great.

50
00:05:08,257 --> 00:05:10,258
I didn't expect
to see you here.

51
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:12,827
I didn't expect to see you,
either. I thought you were

52
00:05:12,828 --> 00:05:15,430
- Going down to spend time with doyle.
- Something came up.

53
00:05:15,431 --> 00:05:17,065
I have to go to london
in the morning.

54
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:18,733
How does doyle
feel about that?

55
00:05:18,734 --> 00:05:21,269
I haven't been able
to reach him yet.

56
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:23,405
You'll be talking to him.
You can tell him.

57
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:25,807
You haven't told him
you're not coming?

58
00:05:29,445 --> 00:05:31,045
I'm sorry.

59
00:05:31,046 --> 00:05:33,715
Could you excuse us?
This is personal.

60
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:43,291
Where the hell
did you find him?

61
00:05:43,292 --> 00:05:44,892
Look, you can
call doyle, okay?

62
00:05:44,893 --> 00:05:47,262
I'm tired of doing
your dirty work for you.

63
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:48,730
I'm being very nice to you.

64
00:05:48,731 --> 00:05:50,532
I gave you a house
to live in,

65
00:05:50,533 --> 00:05:52,900
- With your truck driver.
- He's not a truck driver.

66
00:05:52,901 --> 00:05:55,604
Don't interrupt. You get a
monthly check, a house to live in,

67
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,872
<i>And you get
joint custody of doyle.</i>

68
00:05:57,873 --> 00:06:00,908
You give me a hard time,
you lose it all.

69
00:06:00,909 --> 00:06:03,111
You wouldn't dare
play fair, would you?

70
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:05,380
I wouldn't dare lose.

71
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:09,618
Have a nice holiday.

72
00:06:13,422 --> 00:06:15,089
Excuse me.

73
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:17,559
I know what you were saying
to natalie was personal.

74
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,994
I understand.
I'm involved with her now,

75
00:06:19,995 --> 00:06:22,430
So this is personal, too.

76
00:06:22,431 --> 00:06:24,899
You hurt her, and I'll
hit you so fucking hard,

77
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,068
Your dog will bleed, okay?

78
00:06:29,505 --> 00:06:31,573
Nice meeting you.

79
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:44,702
I just feel weak
and used.

80
00:06:44,703 --> 00:06:46,571
He took you
out of your life,

81
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:49,274
Put you in his,
and took off.

82
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:51,243
I mean,
you don't need him,

83
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:54,479
His house, his money
or his friends.

84
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,148
Make it on your own.

85
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,951
There's only one thing
he has that I want.

86
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:01,953
What the heck
would you do with a set

87
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:04,822
Of tiny little genitals?

88
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:11,729
- I'm being serious.
- I'm sorry.

89
00:07:17,736 --> 00:07:20,989
He has my son.

90
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:45,479
<i>- Boy: Hello?
- I'd like to speak to doyle standish, please.</i>

91
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,415
Oh.

92
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:49,951
Yeah. Hold on.

93
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:03,815
Doyle.

94
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:08,687
<i>Doyle.</i>

95
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:16,027
Do you know
how to knock?

96
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:19,230
<i>- Your ma's on the phone.
- Do you know how to knock?</i>

97
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:22,300
The door was open.

98
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:26,138
<i>It wasn't open.
It was unlocked.</i>

99
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:30,458
<i>Someone from any sort of
decent background would knock.</i>

100
00:08:30,459 --> 00:08:34,012
<i>And she's not my ma.</i>

101
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,781
<i>I don't have a ma.</i>

102
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:39,784
<i>You may have a ma.</i>

103
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:42,336
I have a mother, okay?

104
00:08:42,337 --> 00:08:44,406
Do you want to take
the call, shithead?

105
00:08:44,407 --> 00:08:47,442
I could have you
written up for profanity.

106
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:49,243
Yeah? I'm terrified.

107
00:08:50,579 --> 00:08:52,747
I will have you
written up.

108
00:08:52,748 --> 00:08:54,082
Working
in the kitchen

109
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:56,084
Will be good
for you, teddy.

110
00:08:56,085 --> 00:08:58,386
You can have a taste
of what your career

111
00:08:58,387 --> 00:09:00,889
At burger king
will be like.

112
00:09:04,026 --> 00:09:06,310
What makes you think
you're so superior?

113
00:09:06,311 --> 00:09:08,312
I don't have to think.

114
00:09:08,313 --> 00:09:10,749
It's sickening how much
you love yourself.

115
00:09:15,704 --> 00:09:17,138
Yeah.

116
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,275
I guess it would be

117
00:09:20,276 --> 00:09:22,277
To someone
who's enrolled here

118
00:09:22,278 --> 00:09:25,079
Only because his father
is an employee.

119
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:32,037
At least
I have a father.

120
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:48,503
- Yes?
- Doyle? Hi, sweetheart.

121
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,905
What do you want?

122
00:09:50,906 --> 00:09:53,525
I'm calling
about thanksgiving.

123
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:57,229
<i>- What about it?
- I'd like you to come home.</i>

124
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:01,165
For the umpteenth time,
I'll be with dad.

125
00:10:03,068 --> 00:10:05,337
Dad can't
be with you, honey.

126
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:07,472
He has to go to europe.

127
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:09,774
<i>He told me last night.</i>

128
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,310
<i>So if he's made
any plans with you,</i>

129
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:14,279
<i>Obviously he'll have
to break them.</i>

130
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,938
I really want you
to come home, doyle.

131
00:10:23,939 --> 00:10:26,190
So you can get my approval
of your new boyfriend

132
00:10:26,191 --> 00:10:28,226
To appease your guilt?

133
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:30,629
Look, you are old enough
to be objective

134
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,947
About me and your father
and to understand

135
00:10:32,948 --> 00:10:35,216
<i>Why we're in
the situation we're in.</i>

136
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:38,219
Yeah, I know.
I understand.

137
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,221
<i>You couldn't
make it work.</i>

138
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:43,824
If you could see both sides,
you'd know that that isn't true.

139
00:10:43,825 --> 00:10:46,727
<i>I love you, honey, and-</i>

140
00:10:46,728 --> 00:10:49,597
<i>And I want you home.</i>

141
00:10:49,598 --> 00:10:51,832
I've booked you a flight
on Wednesday,

142
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:53,401
And I expect you
to be on it.

143
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:55,370
Forget it!
I'm not coming home

144
00:10:55,371 --> 00:10:57,272
To spend a holiday
with you or the idiot

145
00:10:57,273 --> 00:10:59,073
You're sharing
the house with, okay?

146
00:10:59,074 --> 00:11:01,009
He is not sharing
a house with me,

147
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:04,645
- And he is hardly
an idiot!

148
00:11:05,981 --> 00:11:07,949
I love you, sweetheart.

149
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:34,025
A little trouble
on the home front?

150
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,449
- Boys: Aw.
- What a jerk.

151
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:14,799
You talk
to your son yet?

152
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,102
- Mm-hmm.
- And?

153
00:12:18,103 --> 00:12:20,321
I don't know.
I have a ticket for him.

154
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:22,123
I know he won't use it.

155
00:12:28,163 --> 00:12:29,864
Do you want to go down
and get him?

156
00:12:29,865 --> 00:12:32,533
He won't
appreciate that.

157
00:12:32,534 --> 00:12:35,286
How about if I go down?

158
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:38,672
There's no better way for two
guys to get to know each other

159
00:12:38,673 --> 00:12:40,892
Than spend a couple
of days in a car.

160
00:12:44,329 --> 00:12:46,030
Dutch.

161
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:48,466
He doesn't want
to know you.

162
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:51,285
Well, from what
I can gather,

163
00:12:51,286 --> 00:12:53,287
All he wants to do

164
00:12:53,288 --> 00:12:56,557
Is sit alone in a room
and hate people.

165
00:12:56,558 --> 00:12:59,127
There's a fair amount
of truth in that.

166
00:12:59,128 --> 00:13:01,663
<i>Let me go down
and get him.</i>

167
00:13:01,664 --> 00:13:03,782
I'm an interested
third party.

168
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,618
I'm a communicator.

169
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,486
I'm a breakthrough
kind of guy.

170
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:11,923
<i>I've handled some pretty
tough birds in my time.</i>

171
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:15,226
And when
the smoke cleared-

172
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:18,062
Almost without exception-

173
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:19,997
I had a new friend.

174
00:13:32,594 --> 00:13:34,595
Smells good.

175
00:13:34,596 --> 00:13:37,131
<i>I want to do this for you.
It's important.</i>

176
00:13:37,132 --> 00:13:39,650
If we're going to be
together from now on,

177
00:13:39,651 --> 00:13:42,320
I'll have to have a good
relationship with darryl.

178
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:47,826
Doyle.

179
00:14:05,861 --> 00:14:07,561
Doyle.

180
00:14:08,697 --> 00:14:10,965
What do you want?

181
00:14:10,966 --> 00:14:12,666
My parents
wanted to know

182
00:14:12,667 --> 00:14:14,401
If, since you're
not going home,

183
00:14:14,402 --> 00:14:17,004
You'd want to come over to
our house for thanksgiving.

184
00:14:17,005 --> 00:14:19,774
Don't think I could
handle that much fun.

185
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:22,376
Is that a no?

186
00:14:22,377 --> 00:14:24,779
That's a no.

187
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,314
Great.
Have a nice weekend

188
00:14:27,315 --> 00:14:30,034
Rotting in your own
pissed-off world.

189
00:14:45,267 --> 00:14:47,268
Peggy, it's me.
I'm at o'hare.

190
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:48,936
Listen, I'm flying
down to atlanta

191
00:14:48,937 --> 00:14:51,372
To pick up my girlfriend's kid from school.

192
00:14:51,373 --> 00:14:52,874
Yeah, it came up
unexpectedly.

193
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,876
Tell tug and fritz
I'll be incommunicado.

194
00:14:54,877 --> 00:14:57,945
They should take care of anything
that comes up. I'll be back on Monday.

195
00:14:57,946 --> 00:15:01,582
Listen, lady, don't jerk me around, okay?

196
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:03,217
I have a letter from him

197
00:15:03,218 --> 00:15:05,486
Saying that he's going
to pick me up.

198
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:08,022
Now, give me his number
in london.

199
00:15:09,324 --> 00:15:10,825
When my father finds out

200
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:13,560
That you refused
to give me his number,

201
00:15:13,561 --> 00:15:14,862
You're fired.

202
00:15:32,447 --> 00:15:35,716
<i> snatch it back
and hold it </i>

203
00:15:35,717 --> 00:15:39,220
<i> I can't help myself </i>

204
00:15:39,221 --> 00:15:42,423
<i> somebody's
got to help me </i>

205
00:15:42,424 --> 00:15:46,394
<i> 'cause I can't
help myself </i>

206
00:15:46,395 --> 00:15:49,564
<i> I'm not doing
too bad, baby </i>

207
00:15:49,565 --> 00:15:51,999
<i> you know, I ain't got
no brand-new bag </i>

208
00:16:07,249 --> 00:16:10,784
<i> a little
he-he-he-he-he-he help. </i>

209
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:39,913
Yo.

210
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:46,954
<i>Doyle.</i>

211
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,461
Doyle?

212
00:17:56,258 --> 00:17:57,191
Dad!

213
00:18:00,795 --> 00:18:02,230
<i>Doyle?</i>

214
00:18:04,199 --> 00:18:06,351
Ooh!

215
00:18:06,352 --> 00:18:07,818
Ooh! Aah!

216
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:11,022
Ow!

217
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:12,724
Ooh!

218
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:13,774
Aaah!

219
00:18:13,775 --> 00:18:14,825
Ohh!

220
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,417
Stand up.

221
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:25,786
What the hell?

222
00:18:25,787 --> 00:18:28,623
I said, stand up!

223
00:18:28,624 --> 00:18:30,074
Hands over
your head!

224
00:18:33,928 --> 00:18:36,764
I don't think
you know who I am.

225
00:18:36,765 --> 00:18:38,883
Ow! Son of a-

226
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:41,452
Ow!

227
00:18:42,671 --> 00:18:47,258
Give me the gun!

228
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:50,227
Aah! Uhh...

229
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:54,965
Uhh...

230
00:18:54,966 --> 00:18:55,783
Uhh!

231
00:18:55,784 --> 00:18:57,418
No, you don't.

232
00:18:59,588 --> 00:19:00,521
Sit.

233
00:19:01,924 --> 00:19:03,490
I'm dutch dooley.

234
00:19:03,491 --> 00:19:05,693
I'm a friend
of your mother's.

235
00:19:05,694 --> 00:19:08,413
I know she called you.

236
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:10,415
What the hell are you
beating me up for?

237
00:19:15,671 --> 00:19:17,104
Ah, jeez.

238
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,075
I feel the pain in my crotch in my teeth.

239
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:23,461
Does campus security
know you're here?

240
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:29,467
Can you say, "I'm sorry
I hit you with a golf club,

241
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:32,236
Kicked your face,
mashed your testes,

242
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:33,838
Shot you twice"?

243
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,107
If that's too much,
a simple hello would do.

244
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:38,008
Answer my question.

245
00:19:38,009 --> 00:19:39,143
You can't say that?

246
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:41,078
Of course I can say it.

247
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:50,087
I choose not to.

248
00:19:53,575 --> 00:19:55,275
Now can you?

249
00:19:55,276 --> 00:19:56,444
No.

250
00:19:57,796 --> 00:19:59,630
Well, I have to shoot you.

251
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:02,700
Now, since we might be
legally related someday,

252
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,352
I'll give you the option
of taking it on the backside.

253
00:20:05,353 --> 00:20:07,088
Won't hurt as bad.

254
00:20:07,089 --> 00:20:09,657
If you shoot me...

255
00:20:09,658 --> 00:20:11,659
I'll have you
arrested.

256
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,812
Well, I'll have to make it
look like an accident, then.

257
00:20:17,949 --> 00:20:19,800
All right, you win.

258
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:22,553
Clearly. Now leave.

259
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,188
I told your mother I'd take
you home for the holidays.

260
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:26,757
I have plans.

261
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:29,543
Stay here? You're gonna
watch the football game,

262
00:20:29,544 --> 00:20:30,878
Make a turkey sandwich,

263
00:20:30,879 --> 00:20:32,680
And hang yourself
in the toilet?

264
00:20:32,681 --> 00:20:33,998
I said I have plans.

265
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:36,167
Leave it at that.
Now please go.

266
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:38,102
Waiting for your dad?

267
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:40,571
I don't have to
tell you anything.

268
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:41,756
He's not coming.

269
00:20:41,757 --> 00:20:43,223
You don't know my dad,
so shut up.

270
00:20:43,224 --> 00:20:44,458
I know he's in london.

271
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:49,447
Is that a fact?

272
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:58,305
We have a very big
problem here.

273
00:20:58,306 --> 00:21:01,175
Yeah. I suppose we do.

274
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,546
I have a problem because
I said I'd pick you up.

275
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:09,233
And you have a problem

276
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:11,069
Because the last guy
that punched me

277
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,104
Has a dent
in his forehead...

278
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,606
About the size
of my pinkie ring.

279
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:20,278
And he dribbles
when he smiles.

280
00:21:28,336 --> 00:21:30,204
Grab your stuff.

281
00:21:32,173 --> 00:21:36,410
Listen one last time.

282
00:21:36,411 --> 00:21:39,112
I'm not going
anywhere with you!

283
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:54,845
What do you like to do
for fun?

284
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:55,846
Mmm!

285
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:57,848
Oh, you like to
wiggle and grunt.

286
00:21:57,849 --> 00:21:58,816
Me, too.

287
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:03,837
 flatfoot sam
bought an automobile 

288
00:22:03,838 --> 00:22:06,740
 no money down,
was a real good deal 

289
00:22:06,741 --> 00:22:09,176
 didn't want to work,
just ride around town 

290
00:22:09,177 --> 00:22:11,745
 the finance company
put his feets on the ground 

291
00:22:11,746 --> 00:22:15,382
 old flatfoot sam,
you're always in a jam 

292
00:22:17,185 --> 00:22:19,853
 flatfoot sam
stole a ten-dollar bill 

293
00:22:19,854 --> 00:22:22,522
 he told the judge
he did it for a thrill 

294
00:22:22,523 --> 00:22:25,258
 he got 60 days,
suspended fine 

295
00:22:25,259 --> 00:22:27,544
 he thanked the jury
for being so kind 

296
00:22:27,545 --> 00:22:31,515
 old flatfoot sam,
you're always in a jam 

297
00:22:35,553 --> 00:22:36,837
I like the back roads.

298
00:22:38,006 --> 00:22:39,707
The only thing you see
on the interstate

299
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:40,841
Is concrete.

300
00:22:44,512 --> 00:22:46,347
You warm enough
back there?

301
00:22:46,348 --> 00:22:47,948
Mmm!

302
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:50,284
You know,
I owe you an apology.

303
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:54,037
I lost my temper,
and I shouldn't have.

304
00:22:54,038 --> 00:22:55,373
I was a little crazy.

305
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,107
I wasn't thinking
too clear, so...

306
00:22:58,459 --> 00:23:00,894
I'm not 100% sure
those undershorts

307
00:23:00,895 --> 00:23:02,796
I jammed in your mouth
to shut you up

308
00:23:02,797 --> 00:23:04,181
Were clean or not.

309
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:05,949
Uhh!

310
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:08,019
Stop the car.

311
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,620
I don't think
that's a good idea.

312
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:11,622
This is only a 2-lane.
That's a soft shoulder.

313
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:13,557
I said, stop the car!

314
00:23:18,045 --> 00:23:19,946
Uhh!

315
00:23:19,947 --> 00:23:20,881
Ohh.

316
00:23:30,224 --> 00:23:32,059
Ohh...

317
00:23:34,328 --> 00:23:36,547
You can't beat a ford
for good brakes.

318
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:38,965
I'm gonna have you
prosecuted for this.

319
00:23:38,966 --> 00:23:41,018
You mean like
in big people's court

320
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:44,438
Or some school teen court,
where if I'm found guilty

321
00:23:44,439 --> 00:23:47,941
I got to roll
naked in the snow or...

322
00:23:47,942 --> 00:23:50,444
Make a bed with my teeth?

323
00:23:50,445 --> 00:23:52,446
My father is one of
the most powerful men

324
00:23:52,447 --> 00:23:54,881
In the country.

325
00:23:54,882 --> 00:23:56,784
When he hears
what you did to me,

326
00:23:56,785 --> 00:23:59,252
He'll sue your
working-class ass

327
00:23:59,253 --> 00:24:02,105
Into complete
and total destitution.

328
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,588
How do you know
I'm working class?

329
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:20,223
From your cheap shoes

330
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:22,192
To your ridiculous
hairstyle

331
00:24:22,193 --> 00:24:25,463
To your crude vocabulary

332
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,598
To my mother's
taste in men...

333
00:24:29,033 --> 00:24:30,300
You scream it.

334
00:24:30,301 --> 00:24:32,703
Oh. All right.

335
00:24:32,704 --> 00:24:34,472
Is working class bad?

336
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:39,577
If you want to get into
a political discussion,

337
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:40,678
I'll shred you.

338
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:44,582
No. It's not bad.

339
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:48,151
A solid economy
needs hand workers.

340
00:24:48,152 --> 00:24:51,154
Well, I used to drive
a cement truck.

341
00:24:51,155 --> 00:24:54,324
My father
was a bricklayer.

342
00:24:54,325 --> 00:24:57,094
My mother used to work
in the laundry

343
00:24:57,095 --> 00:24:59,229
At the pontchartrain
hotel in detroit.

344
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:02,065
You must be very proud.

345
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:05,136
I am.

346
00:25:07,905 --> 00:25:10,374
I still owe you
that shot in the ass,

347
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:12,409
If you want
to get it over with.

348
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:13,594
In case it's gnawing
on your mind.

349
00:25:15,497 --> 00:25:17,264
You know, you might be
the toughest

350
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:19,232
Little whacker
in the junior high,

351
00:25:19,233 --> 00:25:21,167
But in my world, you're
about as worrisome

352
00:25:21,168 --> 00:25:22,936
As a cloudy day.

353
00:25:35,199 --> 00:25:37,100
You got
anything to say?

354
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,705
Me, I like to talk.

355
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:43,206
I love to talk.

356
00:25:43,207 --> 00:25:45,609
Live to talk.

357
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:48,429
You got any
amusing anecdotes?

358
00:25:49,864 --> 00:25:52,332
I'm living through one
right now.

359
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:53,834
There's
some truth there.

360
00:25:55,336 --> 00:25:57,137
Yeah. This is a trip

361
00:25:57,138 --> 00:26:00,240
We won't
soon forget, huh?

362
00:26:00,241 --> 00:26:02,342
You can count on it.

363
00:26:02,343 --> 00:26:04,577
Ha ha ha ha.

364
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:20,411
These are the
cumberland mountains.

365
00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:23,247
Beautiful, aren't they?

366
00:26:33,041 --> 00:26:34,074
Heh.

367
00:26:34,075 --> 00:26:35,943
You know what?

368
00:26:35,944 --> 00:26:37,444
The more you babble,

369
00:26:37,445 --> 00:26:39,013
The more
you reveal yourself

370
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:41,615
As an insecure fool
who's deathly afraid

371
00:26:41,616 --> 00:26:43,550
He's gonna blow
his chance with my mother.

372
00:26:43,551 --> 00:26:45,218
What chance, duncan?

373
00:26:45,219 --> 00:26:47,054
My name's doyle,

374
00:26:47,055 --> 00:26:48,989
And the chance
I'm referring to

375
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:50,658
Has dollar signs
in front of it.

376
00:26:50,659 --> 00:26:51,859
A chance
at your mom's money.

377
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:54,695
Bingo.

378
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:56,030
I may not look like

379
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,497
I could finance
a trip to the zoo,

380
00:26:57,498 --> 00:27:00,200
But the truth is, I make
a pretty good living.

381
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:02,569
My income's a damn sight
more than your father

382
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:04,738
Gives your mother
to live on.

383
00:27:04,739 --> 00:27:07,240
Oh, yeah, but my money
doesn't count

384
00:27:07,241 --> 00:27:08,575
In your neighborhood...

385
00:27:08,576 --> 00:27:10,544
Because I worked for it.

386
00:27:14,315 --> 00:27:16,684
Working for your money
doesn't matter

387
00:27:16,685 --> 00:27:19,286
In your part
of the world.

388
00:27:19,287 --> 00:27:24,658
It's whose crotch the doctor
yanked you out of, huh?

389
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:26,293
You're disgusting.

390
00:27:26,294 --> 00:27:30,731
 have you ever seen 

391
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:35,102
 the night so long? 

392
00:27:35,103 --> 00:27:40,174
 stars begin to cry 

393
00:27:40,175 --> 00:27:46,513
 that means they've
lost the will to live 

394
00:27:46,514 --> 00:27:51,618
 I'm so lonesome,
I could cry 

395
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:35,812
Fill it up, please.

396
00:28:35,813 --> 00:28:37,414
Unleaded-regular.

397
00:29:16,871 --> 00:29:19,139
We're going to
have some fun now.

398
00:29:20,775 --> 00:29:22,309
Do you like
fireworks?

399
00:29:29,818 --> 00:29:32,052
Is that a "yes,"
a "no," a "maybe"?

400
00:29:32,053 --> 00:29:33,987
Your testicles
descending? What?

401
00:29:33,988 --> 00:29:36,357
Fireworks are illegal
in illinois.

402
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:37,991
Yes, they are.
But this is tennessee,

403
00:29:37,992 --> 00:29:39,560
So it doesn't matter.

404
00:29:39,561 --> 00:29:43,029
You're going to detonate
this material now?

405
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,514
Not here
in the gas station.

406
00:29:44,515 --> 00:29:47,217
Are you nuts?
Go down the road apiece.

407
00:29:47,218 --> 00:29:50,887
I got m-80s,
I got dragon tongues,

408
00:29:50,888 --> 00:29:52,388
I got, uh...

409
00:29:52,389 --> 00:29:54,157
Oh... Heh heh heh...

410
00:29:54,158 --> 00:29:56,526
I don't even know
what this is.

411
00:29:56,527 --> 00:29:59,029
I got jersey stinkers,
bombay bugles,

412
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:02,966
And for later,
I got a bag of pretzels,

413
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,868
And...

414
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:09,773
I got a deck
of racy playing cards.

415
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:12,643
Huh?

416
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:53,850
You know what?

417
00:30:53,851 --> 00:30:57,153
You're like a great big
demented child.

418
00:35:27,992 --> 00:35:28,959
Now, that was fun.

419
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:35,966
Can't beat a good
fireworks show.

420
00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:49,779
Well, I guess
you want to eat.

421
00:36:31,338 --> 00:36:33,690
Waitress: Okay, sugar,
what'll it be?

422
00:36:36,394 --> 00:36:38,628
What won't
make me vomit?

423
00:36:50,891 --> 00:36:52,492
I know you're lying.

424
00:36:52,493 --> 00:36:54,194
Dutch: No,
we're getting along great.

425
00:36:54,195 --> 00:36:56,129
Well, a few problems.

426
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:58,098
Nah, nothing serious.

427
00:37:01,285 --> 00:37:03,353
<i> till the end of
the world rolls 'round </i>

428
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:05,488
<i> I'll keep on loving you </i>

429
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:07,757
<i> as long as the sun
goes up and comes down </i>

430
00:37:07,758 --> 00:37:09,993
<i> till the big blue sky
comes down to the ground </i>

431
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:12,262
<i> as long as the world
goes around and around </i>

432
00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:14,464
<i> I'll keep on lovin' you </i>

433
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:23,356
<i> I tried to sail
the sea of life </i>

434
00:37:23,357 --> 00:37:25,375
<i> I rowed my boat alone </i>

435
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,277
<i> your love meant
nothin' to me, dear </i>

436
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:29,679
<i> my heart
was made of stone </i>

437
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,681
<i> to a harbor filled
with loneliness </i>

438
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:33,850
<i> my little boat
was moored </i>

439
00:37:33,851 --> 00:37:35,886
<i> and then the day
I first met you </i>

440
00:37:35,887 --> 00:37:38,688
<i> I fell right overboard </i>

441
00:37:38,689 --> 00:37:41,091
<i> till the end of
the world rolls 'round </i>

442
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,226
<i> I'll keep on
lovin' you... </i>

443
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:23,533
<i> so now I know
the way I felt </i>

444
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:25,402
<i> was only selfish pride </i>

445
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:27,537
<i> I thought my heart
was fireproof </i>

446
00:38:27,538 --> 00:38:29,922
<i> but you burned
your way inside </i>

447
00:38:29,923 --> 00:38:31,474
<i> so tell me what
I've got to do </i>

448
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:32,942
<i> and tell me- </i>

449
00:38:59,553 --> 00:39:00,953
Smoke bother you?

450
00:39:02,956 --> 00:39:03,889
Yes.

451
00:39:09,896 --> 00:39:12,148
You're asking for it
so bad.

452
00:39:12,149 --> 00:39:14,484
Heh heh heh.

453
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:15,568
I'm not kidding.

454
00:39:15,569 --> 00:39:17,737
You have no idea
how serious I can get

455
00:39:17,738 --> 00:39:20,673
When I want to
let somebody have it.

456
00:39:20,674 --> 00:39:22,041
Hmm. You know,

457
00:39:22,042 --> 00:39:24,410
You might be able
to do some damage

458
00:39:24,411 --> 00:39:26,679
To the small
and exclusive group

459
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,514
Of people
that care about you.

460
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:33,753
But... I don't think

461
00:39:33,754 --> 00:39:36,939
You could raise a welt
on my fanny...

462
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,491
Because frankly,

463
00:39:38,492 --> 00:39:40,126
I don't care
if you live, die,

464
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:42,462
Or grow mushrooms
in your crack.

465
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:45,832
I'll get you so bad.

466
00:39:45,833 --> 00:39:47,734
I don't think so.

467
00:39:47,735 --> 00:39:48,901
You want to put
some money on it?

468
00:39:48,902 --> 00:39:50,870
How much?
$5,000.

469
00:39:50,871 --> 00:39:51,854
$5,000.

470
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:56,159
I'll bet you got it,
too, huh?

471
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,729
In a little gilded box
under your bed.

472
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,464
We'll keep it modest.

473
00:40:01,465 --> 00:40:03,233
20 bucks.

474
00:40:08,272 --> 00:40:09,321
It's a bet.

475
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:13,376
Hey! Oh! Aah!

476
00:40:15,129 --> 00:40:16,562
Ow!

477
00:40:16,563 --> 00:40:18,381
Damn it! Ow!

478
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:26,356
Bastard! You little
son of a bitch!

479
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:39,102
Uhh!

480
00:40:43,156 --> 00:40:44,490
Go to hell!

481
00:40:50,931 --> 00:40:52,582
I won the bet! Ha ha!

482
00:40:57,471 --> 00:40:58,922
Yah!

483
00:41:05,412 --> 00:41:06,512
Throw one more-

484
00:41:06,513 --> 00:41:08,380
Throw one more,
and I'm leaving you.

485
00:41:08,381 --> 00:41:09,882
Promise?

486
00:41:09,883 --> 00:41:12,351
Guaranteed.

487
00:41:12,352 --> 00:41:13,686
Good riddance!

488
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:21,894
Here. I'll see you
at the motel...

489
00:41:21,895 --> 00:41:23,863
About 50 miles
down the road.

490
00:41:25,466 --> 00:41:26,315
Uhh!

491
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:35,341
Wait a minute!

492
00:41:35,342 --> 00:41:36,776
Stop!

493
00:41:36,777 --> 00:41:38,277
I'll die!

494
00:42:15,483 --> 00:42:16,716
Uhh!

495
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:33,466
Hello.

496
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:34,601
Hello?

497
00:42:35,869 --> 00:42:36,936
Hello?

498
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:45,728
Shit.

499
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:05,774
You want to
close the door?

500
00:44:07,611 --> 00:44:10,012
I could have frozen
to death, you asshole.

501
00:44:10,013 --> 00:44:11,714
Oh, I don't think
you would've frozen.

502
00:44:11,715 --> 00:44:13,015
Not solid, anyway.

503
00:44:13,016 --> 00:44:14,850
It's not quite cold
enough for that.

504
00:44:23,793 --> 00:44:26,295
Here's something you should
know about me, dale.

505
00:44:26,296 --> 00:44:29,465
I don't screw around.
You piss me off,

506
00:44:29,466 --> 00:44:31,033
I react.

507
00:44:31,034 --> 00:44:33,068
I'm not your dad.
I'm not your grampy.

508
00:44:33,069 --> 00:44:34,403
I'm not your uncle.

509
00:44:34,404 --> 00:44:37,206
I'm a working-class
nobody,

510
00:44:37,207 --> 00:44:40,075
And I don't take crap
from kiddies.

511
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:49,352
Where's my bag?

512
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:51,937
Oh, I didn't bother
to bring it in.

513
00:44:51,938 --> 00:44:53,939
I figured you for dead.

514
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:57,577
Give me the keys.

515
00:45:01,415 --> 00:45:02,582
Lock up
when you're through.

516
00:45:20,984 --> 00:45:22,117
Doyle!

517
00:45:22,118 --> 00:45:23,569
Whoa!

518
00:45:23,570 --> 00:45:24,620
Doyle!

519
00:45:24,621 --> 00:45:28,324
Just-what the hell
are you doing?

520
00:45:28,325 --> 00:45:29,124
Get back here!

521
00:45:32,729 --> 00:45:33,829
Damn it!

522
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:43,573
God damn...

523
00:45:52,549 --> 00:45:54,349
Uhh!

524
00:45:58,555 --> 00:45:59,488
Doyle.

525
00:46:01,257 --> 00:46:02,608
Doyle!

526
00:46:32,305 --> 00:46:33,239
Doyle.

527
00:46:36,309 --> 00:46:37,577
Doyle!

528
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:47,336
I never saw a thing!

529
00:46:47,337 --> 00:46:49,122
He came from
out of nowhere!

530
00:46:49,123 --> 00:46:50,956
Doyle!

531
00:47:03,970 --> 00:47:04,904
Doyle.

532
00:47:14,114 --> 00:47:16,615
I think
this makes us even.

533
00:47:46,396 --> 00:47:47,763
You're a lucky man.

534
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:50,266
Thanks.

535
00:47:52,336 --> 00:47:55,171
Hey, thanks for going
along with my story.

536
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:56,739
I really appreciate it.

537
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:58,674
The kid's got
emotional problems.

538
00:47:58,675 --> 00:48:01,643
The last thing he needs
is police trouble.

539
00:48:05,782 --> 00:48:07,283
Take this...

540
00:48:07,284 --> 00:48:09,852
Put it towards any repairs
you might have and your time.

541
00:48:09,853 --> 00:48:12,355
If it's not enough,
call me.

542
00:48:12,356 --> 00:48:15,091
My number's
on the card. Okay?

543
00:48:15,092 --> 00:48:17,260
Thanks. I appreciate it.

544
00:48:19,096 --> 00:48:21,297
If it wasn't
for your daddy,

545
00:48:21,298 --> 00:48:24,333
I'd have busted
every bone in your body!

546
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,048
Show's over. Go home.

547
00:48:39,049 --> 00:48:40,232
Go home.

548
00:48:46,339 --> 00:48:48,240
Listen, you little
son of a bitch,

549
00:48:48,241 --> 00:48:50,276
You could've killed somebody
with a stunt like that.

550
00:48:50,277 --> 00:48:52,844
That poor bastard was on
his way home to see his family,

551
00:48:52,845 --> 00:48:55,814
And because you want to play
some kind of spoiled brat prank,

552
00:48:55,815 --> 00:48:57,316
You put his life
in jeopardy.

553
00:48:57,317 --> 00:48:59,885
Now, what gives you
the right to do that, huh?

554
00:48:59,886 --> 00:49:02,572
I guess I didn't
think about that.

555
00:49:02,573 --> 00:49:04,540
You better start thinking
about a little something else

556
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:06,241
Besides your own
spoiled ass.

557
00:49:06,242 --> 00:49:07,910
I took on
this idiotic assignment

558
00:49:07,911 --> 00:49:09,511
Because I love your mother.

559
00:49:09,512 --> 00:49:11,747
I got to wonder
how nuts I am.

560
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:13,583
Man, I've met some scum
in my life,

561
00:49:13,584 --> 00:49:16,218
But you beat all, man.
You are absolutely worthless.

562
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:18,254
You know what?
This isn't a joke anymore.

563
00:49:18,255 --> 00:49:20,722
This is a full-blown mission.
You're not gonna beat me.

564
00:49:20,723 --> 00:49:23,192
I've had my head split open,
my nose mashed.

565
00:49:23,193 --> 00:49:25,127
I've been kicked and beat
and left for dead.

566
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:27,896
When I set you down
on your mama's doorstep,

567
00:49:27,897 --> 00:49:30,366
You're going to be
one whipped little puppy.

568
00:49:37,407 --> 00:49:39,741
Don't flatter yourself.

569
00:49:41,278 --> 00:49:42,845
Get your hands down.

570
00:49:42,846 --> 00:49:44,847
I'm not taking
any more of your crap.

571
00:49:44,848 --> 00:49:46,915
You touch me once more,
you'll be sorry.

572
00:49:46,916 --> 00:49:49,418
You want to go? Is that it?
You want me to go?

573
00:49:49,419 --> 00:49:50,819
Hell, I'd love to go.
You want to go?

574
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:52,921
Yeah.
Okay, fine.

575
00:49:52,922 --> 00:49:55,557
Let's see if your punch
is as big as your mouth.

576
00:49:55,558 --> 00:49:58,027
Only this time,
no sissy kicks, okay?

577
00:49:58,028 --> 00:49:59,195
No geometry,

578
00:49:59,196 --> 00:50:02,264
No kamikaze tricks,
no sucker punches.

579
00:50:02,265 --> 00:50:04,900
Just good all-american
street fighting.

580
00:50:04,901 --> 00:50:06,902
Let me show you
how to do it, all right?

581
00:50:06,903 --> 00:50:08,937
Give me
your little digits.

582
00:50:08,938 --> 00:50:11,440
Here. That's it.
Curl your little digits,

583
00:50:11,441 --> 00:50:12,975
And you wad those up

584
00:50:12,976 --> 00:50:14,843
In little bitty balls
like that.

585
00:50:14,844 --> 00:50:17,013
Watch your little thumbies.
Put your thumbies out here

586
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:18,381
So you don't break them.

587
00:50:18,382 --> 00:50:20,182
Get loose. That's it.
Bend your little knees.

588
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:22,218
That's it. Okay?

589
00:50:22,219 --> 00:50:24,686
Let me see you fight
like a man, okay?

590
00:50:24,687 --> 00:50:26,822
Now, you take
the first shot.

591
00:50:26,823 --> 00:50:28,690
Give me your best punch,
all right?

592
00:50:28,691 --> 00:50:31,860
Come on. Come on,
give it to me, pipsqueak.

593
00:52:09,843 --> 00:52:12,545
 ba-dah-ow 

594
00:52:42,508 --> 00:52:44,810
How'd you sleep...

595
00:52:44,811 --> 00:52:46,078
Ace?

596
00:52:50,316 --> 00:52:52,184
Okay.
Good.

597
00:52:53,486 --> 00:52:54,820
How's your face?

598
00:52:54,821 --> 00:52:55,988
Fine.

599
00:52:55,989 --> 00:52:57,823
No problem.

600
00:52:57,824 --> 00:53:01,560
Partial apology if I did
any permanent damage.

601
00:53:01,561 --> 00:53:04,096
It's gonna take
a lot more than you got

602
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:06,465
To give me
any permanent damage.

603
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:10,836
My doctor wants me

604
00:53:10,837 --> 00:53:12,805
To get my cholesterol
under 1,000,

605
00:53:12,806 --> 00:53:16,208
But hot cakes and bacon
on a cold day-

606
00:53:16,209 --> 00:53:17,877
Pretty sexy.

607
00:53:17,878 --> 00:53:20,095
I want you to know
that I could have hurt you

608
00:53:20,096 --> 00:53:21,663
A lot more than I did.

609
00:53:21,664 --> 00:53:23,482
Yeah.
Seriously.

610
00:53:23,483 --> 00:53:25,050
I'm a high brown belt.

611
00:53:25,051 --> 00:53:26,218
Yeah?

612
00:53:26,219 --> 00:53:29,288
Yeah. I've been training
for 3 years.

613
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:35,694
Your working-class ego

614
00:53:35,695 --> 00:53:37,797
Can't handle a kid of
my position and standing

615
00:53:37,798 --> 00:53:40,232
Beating you up, can it?

616
00:53:40,233 --> 00:53:42,935
My working-class ego
can handle that

617
00:53:42,936 --> 00:53:45,137
And a hell of
a lot more.

618
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:48,223
Are you admitting that
I could defeat you in a fight?

619
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:51,877
Why don't you shut up?

620
00:53:51,878 --> 00:53:53,913
I beat you mentally,

621
00:53:53,914 --> 00:53:56,481
Then I beat you
physically.

622
00:53:56,482 --> 00:53:58,383
You know, yesterday
you had nothing to say.

623
00:53:58,384 --> 00:53:59,584
Today you're a parrot.

624
00:53:59,585 --> 00:54:00,886
I'm ready here.

625
00:54:04,257 --> 00:54:08,160
You know, for a split
second last night,

626
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:09,862
I sort
of respected you...

627
00:54:09,863 --> 00:54:13,365
For how you handled
the cops and the accident.

628
00:54:13,366 --> 00:54:17,135
But today, I see my initial
impression is correct.

629
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:20,706
You're a clod.

630
00:54:21,875 --> 00:54:24,109
And the cool part is...

631
00:54:24,110 --> 00:54:25,711
I can say that,

632
00:54:25,712 --> 00:54:28,146
And you can't do
anything about it

633
00:54:28,147 --> 00:54:29,682
'cause I can
kick your butt.

634
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:33,986
Well,
I won't cop to that,

635
00:54:33,987 --> 00:54:36,121
But I will say this-

636
00:54:36,122 --> 00:54:38,624
There's one thing
I can do that you can't.

637
00:54:38,625 --> 00:54:40,860
What?

638
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:47,116
I can pay
for my breakfast.

639
00:54:56,326 --> 00:54:58,660
Nothing burps
better than bacon.

640
00:55:02,765 --> 00:55:04,899
Your water looked tasty.

641
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:32,060
You're insane.
Do you have any idea

642
00:55:32,061 --> 00:55:34,129
How dangerous it is
to hitchhike?

643
00:55:36,299 --> 00:55:38,300
You have
a high brown belt.

644
00:55:38,301 --> 00:55:40,369
What are you
worried about?

645
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:42,271
You're an idiot.

646
00:55:42,272 --> 00:55:44,739
You got a better way
to get home?

647
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:47,309
We're not without means,
for god's sake.

648
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:49,077
We are at the moment.
We got 20 bucks.

649
00:55:49,078 --> 00:55:51,647
You ever heard
of a telephone?

650
00:55:51,648 --> 00:55:55,184
Call my mother.
I'll call my grandfather.

651
00:55:57,671 --> 00:55:59,705
Someday you're gonna
get into a situation

652
00:55:59,706 --> 00:56:01,740
Where you can't call
for help.

653
00:56:01,741 --> 00:56:04,009
You'll have to depend
on yourself.

654
00:56:04,010 --> 00:56:06,311
And you'll
let yourself down.

655
00:56:06,312 --> 00:56:07,162
I'm not calling

656
00:56:07,163 --> 00:56:08,863
Because I don't want
your mother to think

657
00:56:08,864 --> 00:56:10,765
We can't make it home
on our own.

658
00:56:10,766 --> 00:56:13,402
Call it male pride.
Old-fashioned,

659
00:56:13,403 --> 00:56:15,270
Pigheaded,
working-class,

660
00:56:15,271 --> 00:56:17,272
Pre-fax machine/
car phone

661
00:56:17,273 --> 00:56:18,773
Masculine pride.

662
00:56:18,774 --> 00:56:20,642
No accountants,
no lawyers,

663
00:56:20,643 --> 00:56:24,413
No mommies, no daddies,
no washington lobbyists,

664
00:56:24,414 --> 00:56:27,082
Just a man...
And his wits.

665
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:28,983
Yeah. That's helpful

666
00:56:28,984 --> 00:56:31,186
When you're face-down,
dead in a ditch.

667
00:56:31,187 --> 00:56:32,721
That's part of it, too.

668
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:35,357
But you roll the dice,
you take what you get.

669
00:56:45,968 --> 00:56:48,237
We're not doing
too good here.

670
00:57:01,768 --> 00:57:03,034
Excuse me.

671
00:57:05,438 --> 00:57:07,739
Does that music
have to be so loud?

672
00:57:12,878 --> 00:57:14,730
Thank you.

673
00:57:33,132 --> 00:57:35,133
What'd you pay
for them shoes?

674
00:57:41,107 --> 00:57:42,140
Did you steal them?

675
00:57:47,413 --> 00:57:49,047
I chargedthem.

676
00:57:49,048 --> 00:57:50,048
Hmm.

677
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:54,586
See, my friend here

678
00:57:54,587 --> 00:57:57,089
Really wants
those shoes.

679
00:58:15,674 --> 00:58:18,777
Well, we're really
moving now, huh?

680
00:58:23,149 --> 00:58:25,283
It's your mother.
Come on, talk to her.

681
00:58:47,106 --> 00:58:49,440
Getting hungry for
your turkey dinner?

682
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:01,453
Remember-
I'm your dad.

683
00:59:01,454 --> 00:59:02,954
I got a bad heart.

684
00:59:04,607 --> 00:59:06,175
Dale, look at me.

685
00:59:09,011 --> 00:59:10,879
Is that your
most pathetic look?

686
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,965
This is my
"death to you" look.

687
00:59:13,966 --> 00:59:16,100
That's not gonna
get us a ride.

688
00:59:16,101 --> 00:59:17,268
Be pathetic!

689
00:59:17,269 --> 00:59:18,202
Try it!

690
00:59:20,172 --> 00:59:22,674
Pretend that you're not
gonna get $10 million

691
00:59:22,675 --> 00:59:24,476
When you're 21.

692
00:59:24,477 --> 00:59:27,462
You have no plan,
do you?

693
00:59:27,463 --> 00:59:29,498
I got a rough outline.

694
00:59:31,167 --> 00:59:34,135
Actually,
I'm the idiot...

695
00:59:34,136 --> 00:59:35,571
'cause I'm going
along with it.

696
00:59:39,775 --> 00:59:41,510
See? Hands up. Try it.

697
00:59:44,647 --> 00:59:46,014
Come on.

698
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:50,051
Look up. Look up.
Come on.

699
00:59:50,052 --> 00:59:53,788
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

700
01:00:07,403 --> 01:00:09,104
Hurry, hurry!
It's freezing.

701
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:10,305
All right.

702
01:00:10,306 --> 01:00:12,107
Oh, no.

703
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:15,377
Oh, my god.

704
01:00:15,378 --> 01:00:17,362
That's it.
Smile, smile.

705
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:19,865
Smile.
That's it.

706
01:00:29,775 --> 01:00:31,409
Smile with
that face.

707
01:00:38,618 --> 01:00:40,218
Attaboy.
Attaboy!

708
01:00:42,922 --> 01:00:44,990
Oh, help us here,
please.

709
01:00:46,993 --> 01:00:49,010
It's pathetic.
It is really pathetic.

710
01:00:49,011 --> 01:00:50,345
Beg.

711
01:00:50,346 --> 01:00:51,846
help me.

712
01:00:51,847 --> 01:00:53,148
Help me.

713
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:54,849
I don't have a ride.

714
01:00:54,850 --> 01:00:58,136
Help me.

715
01:00:58,137 --> 01:00:59,670
We have
to help them.

716
01:00:59,671 --> 01:01:00,605
That's it.

717
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:08,096
You want a ride,

718
01:01:08,097 --> 01:01:09,798
You got to
look grievous.

719
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:13,101
See?

720
01:01:13,102 --> 01:01:14,303
My heart.

721
01:01:22,094 --> 01:01:22,994
Hey, kid!

722
01:01:26,732 --> 01:01:29,100
We're going to hammond.
Do you wanna come along?

723
01:01:29,101 --> 01:01:30,268
Get the suitcase.
Let's go.

724
01:01:30,269 --> 01:01:32,337
We got a ride.
Come on.

725
01:01:32,338 --> 01:01:34,672
Not too fast,
but not too slow.

726
01:01:34,673 --> 01:01:36,207
That's it. Wave
at them a little.

727
01:01:36,208 --> 01:01:37,142
That's it.

728
01:01:54,226 --> 01:01:56,194
<i> tryin' to make
a silk purse </i>

729
01:01:56,195 --> 01:01:58,680
<i> from a drunk,
old pig now </i>

730
01:02:00,683 --> 01:02:02,800
<i> just because
of mass hysteria </i>

731
01:02:02,801 --> 01:02:04,753
<i> don't mean
that it's hip </i>

732
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:10,192
<i> I like to scare
the next-door neighbors </i>

733
01:02:10,193 --> 01:02:13,628
<i> bring the property
values down... </i>

734
01:02:14,897 --> 01:02:17,165
You guys on vacation
or something?

735
01:02:17,166 --> 01:02:19,801
We're going home to
hammond for the holidays.

736
01:02:19,802 --> 01:02:21,737
Both our families
are from there.

737
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:23,538
Ah. We're
going home, too.

738
01:02:23,539 --> 01:02:25,440
You got a nice kid.

739
01:02:25,441 --> 01:02:27,675
Yeah.

740
01:02:27,676 --> 01:02:32,030
<i> baby, don't you know
that I'm stuck on </i>

741
01:02:32,031 --> 01:02:34,399
<i> the wrong side
of the tracks... </i>

742
01:02:37,803 --> 01:02:39,871
So, what's the word
on you two?

743
01:02:39,872 --> 01:02:41,039
How do you mean?

744
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:42,540
Well,
are you drifters?

745
01:02:42,541 --> 01:02:44,042
Oh, yeah,
more or less.

746
01:02:44,043 --> 01:02:45,510
Yeah,
I thought so.

747
01:02:45,511 --> 01:02:46,711
How about you?

748
01:02:46,712 --> 01:02:50,715
Brock?
Yeah?

749
01:02:50,716 --> 01:02:53,551
Ha ha. Dutch wants
to know what we do.

750
01:02:53,552 --> 01:02:55,319
Well, I don't want
to be nosy, you know.

751
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:57,488
I was just making conversation.
It's not important.

752
01:02:57,489 --> 01:02:59,290
Brock: No, please.
It's fine.

753
01:02:59,291 --> 01:03:00,692
No, tell him.

754
01:03:00,693 --> 01:03:02,694
We're call girls.

755
01:03:02,695 --> 01:03:05,414
<i> there was
a little mansion </i>

756
01:03:05,415 --> 01:03:08,717
<i> but it seemed
so damn run-down </i>

757
01:03:08,718 --> 01:03:12,804
<i> baby, you are
out of luck... </i>

758
01:03:12,805 --> 01:03:15,173
I didn't want
to say "prostitute"

759
01:03:15,174 --> 01:03:18,092
In front of the boy.

760
01:03:18,093 --> 01:03:20,879
<i> that I'm stuck on... </i>

761
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,647
I appreciate it.

762
01:03:25,450 --> 01:03:27,251
So, we were down
in new orleans

763
01:03:27,252 --> 01:03:28,753
At the superdome

764
01:03:28,754 --> 01:03:30,521
For the housewares
convention...

765
01:03:32,758 --> 01:03:35,326
We also do
a little dancing.

766
01:03:35,327 --> 01:03:36,795
Naked?

767
01:03:39,531 --> 01:03:41,499
Don't worry about it.
I have a little brother.

768
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:43,568
Just on top, sweetie.

769
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:54,045
<i> if the music
makes me money </i>

770
01:03:54,046 --> 01:03:57,282
<i> and it brings me
lots of cash </i>

771
01:03:57,283 --> 01:04:00,151
<i> it'll be
the outlaw country... </i>

772
01:04:19,205 --> 01:04:20,739
Doyle:
So your parents know

773
01:04:20,740 --> 01:04:22,807
And they haven't
disowned you?

774
01:04:22,808 --> 01:04:24,809
Ha ha.
No, not yet.

775
01:04:24,810 --> 01:04:27,545
Don't you think that's
a little amazing?

776
01:04:27,546 --> 01:04:30,414
Hmm... Not really.
I'm honest about it.

777
01:04:30,415 --> 01:04:33,017
And I don't hurt anybody-
not on purpose.

778
01:04:33,018 --> 01:04:35,720
You don't think it
hurts your parents?

779
01:04:35,721 --> 01:04:38,790
Well, eventually,
if you live long enough,

780
01:04:38,791 --> 01:04:41,292
You're bound to hurt
your parents somehow.

781
01:04:41,293 --> 01:04:42,844
Yeah...

782
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:47,382
It's none
of my business.

783
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:53,321
So... Do you get along
with your dad?

784
01:04:53,322 --> 01:04:55,390
That guy's
not my dad.

785
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:57,559
That's my mother's
boyfriend.

786
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:00,028
I hate saying that.
It's so sick.

787
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:04,499
He's picking me up
for thanksgiving break,

788
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:06,167
'cause I go
to this private school

789
01:05:06,168 --> 01:05:08,436
Down south.

790
01:05:08,437 --> 01:05:09,871
I hate his guts.

791
01:05:14,309 --> 01:05:15,777
He's trying to
get to know me

792
01:05:15,778 --> 01:05:17,979
'cause I think
he's planning

793
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:21,016
On marrying
my mother.

794
01:05:21,017 --> 01:05:23,484
Is there something
wrong with that?

795
01:05:23,485 --> 01:05:25,987
I'm not too crazy
about my mother

796
01:05:25,988 --> 01:05:27,389
To begin with,

797
01:05:27,390 --> 01:05:29,457
And he's
just a slob.

798
01:05:29,458 --> 01:05:33,295
The less I know,
the better.

799
01:05:33,296 --> 01:05:35,496
Yeah, well, he seems to be
going through a lot of shit

800
01:05:35,497 --> 01:05:36,998
To get you home.

801
01:05:36,999 --> 01:05:39,401
It's on purpose.

802
01:05:39,402 --> 01:05:41,102
See, he's got this
ridiculous plan

803
01:05:41,103 --> 01:05:43,238
To drag me around
until I break.

804
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:44,472
Ha ha ha.

805
01:05:44,473 --> 01:05:47,108
He's got a shock
coming, though.

806
01:05:47,109 --> 01:05:48,376
I don't break.

807
01:05:48,377 --> 01:05:50,578
Hmm.

808
01:05:50,579 --> 01:05:52,780
So, what's wrong
with your mom?

809
01:05:52,781 --> 01:05:55,683
She divorced my dad,
for starters.

810
01:05:55,684 --> 01:05:58,786
Yeah, well, it takes 2
to make a thing go bad.

811
01:05:58,787 --> 01:06:00,055
She didn't
make it work.

812
01:06:02,992 --> 01:06:04,259
You know...

813
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:06,828
Maybe it's just easier
to blame her.

814
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:47,335
You know,
maybe you should stop

815
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:48,736
Knocking your mom
so much

816
01:06:48,737 --> 01:06:50,271
And try to make things
work with her.

817
01:06:52,708 --> 01:06:56,011
I don't think that's
going to happen.

818
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:58,046
But I really like
talking to you.

819
01:06:58,047 --> 01:06:59,347
Ha ha.

820
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:03,784
Well, maybe I'll come up
and visit you sometime.

821
01:07:03,785 --> 01:07:06,621
That would
be excellent.

822
01:07:06,622 --> 01:07:07,788
Ha ha ha.

823
01:07:12,561 --> 01:07:13,528
Heh heh.

824
01:08:04,696 --> 01:08:08,532
Brock...

825
01:08:08,533 --> 01:08:09,934
Hey...

826
01:08:09,935 --> 01:08:11,769
You want to wake up
your little friend

827
01:08:11,770 --> 01:08:13,737
So he can stretch
his legs?

828
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:16,174
Mm.

829
01:08:21,447 --> 01:08:24,048
Hey. Ha ha.

830
01:08:24,049 --> 01:08:26,250
Hey... Wake up.

831
01:08:30,956 --> 01:08:33,424
You want to go
for a walk?

832
01:08:38,063 --> 01:08:40,564
Yeah.

833
01:08:40,565 --> 01:08:44,135
Yeah. I was just
dreaming about that.

834
01:08:44,136 --> 01:08:45,336
Ha ha ha.

835
01:09:05,241 --> 01:09:06,307
Uhh.

836
01:09:20,956 --> 01:09:22,290
What time is it?

837
01:09:23,425 --> 01:09:24,558
7:30.

838
01:09:24,559 --> 01:09:26,261
I'll drive
the next shift.

839
01:09:26,262 --> 01:09:28,529
I'm fine. Could you
do me a favor, though?

840
01:09:28,530 --> 01:09:30,298
Could you go inside
and get directions?

841
01:09:30,299 --> 01:09:32,016
I just want to make sure
I don't get all screwed up.

842
01:09:32,017 --> 01:09:33,984
Sure. We got
enough time to eat?

843
01:09:33,985 --> 01:09:35,319
Yeah, yeah.

844
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:37,121
You go inside and we'll
take care of this

845
01:09:37,122 --> 01:09:38,222
And we'll meet you
inside.

846
01:09:38,223 --> 01:09:39,557
Let's go, dobie.

847
01:09:39,558 --> 01:09:40,758
Uh...

848
01:09:40,759 --> 01:09:43,627
I'll come in
with brock.

849
01:09:43,628 --> 01:09:46,097
Uh, no,
you go ahead, babe.

850
01:09:46,098 --> 01:09:47,631
I, uh...

851
01:09:47,632 --> 01:09:51,602
I have to get something
from my bag.

852
01:09:51,603 --> 01:09:52,720
I'll meet you
inside, okay?

853
01:09:52,721 --> 01:09:53,954
Okay.

854
01:09:56,025 --> 01:09:57,091
Bye.

855
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:01,029
Yes.

856
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:02,396
Yes!

857
01:10:02,397 --> 01:10:04,131
I lifted
the toad's wallet.

858
01:10:04,132 --> 01:10:05,233
Aah!

859
01:10:06,602 --> 01:10:08,102
Oh... Why?

860
01:10:08,103 --> 01:10:10,037
Because it was there.

861
01:10:10,038 --> 01:10:11,372
Well...

862
01:10:11,373 --> 01:10:13,774
I was just beginning
to feel respectable.

863
01:10:13,775 --> 01:10:17,078
Let's not waste a lot
of time eating, okay?

864
01:10:19,415 --> 01:10:22,467
I want to get back in
the car and keep moving.

865
01:10:22,468 --> 01:10:24,201
Yeah.

866
01:10:24,202 --> 01:10:26,537
Yeah, I know why
you want to keep moving.

867
01:10:26,538 --> 01:10:28,539
Let me tell you
something, dwight.

868
01:10:28,540 --> 01:10:30,541
Those 2 gals
are a couple of pros.

869
01:10:30,542 --> 01:10:33,010
I got half a mind to refuse
the rest of the trip.

870
01:10:33,011 --> 01:10:35,045
Do you know what
your mother would say

871
01:10:35,046 --> 01:10:37,014
If she knew what
you were doing?

872
01:10:37,015 --> 01:10:39,400
You refuse the ride,

873
01:10:39,401 --> 01:10:41,535
I'll tell her...
In detail.

874
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:45,607
You know, you really are
a hypocrite, aren't you?

875
01:10:45,608 --> 01:10:47,658
A couple of hookers...

876
01:10:47,659 --> 01:10:50,528
A couple of hookers
got a set of rockets,

877
01:10:50,529 --> 01:10:51,662
That's okay.

878
01:10:51,663 --> 01:10:54,599
But anyone else in their
station in life is scum.

879
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:55,933
That's not true.

880
01:10:55,934 --> 01:10:58,002
You and I are riding
in the back seat from now on.

881
01:10:58,003 --> 01:11:00,204
Because what that
missile twister can teach you,

882
01:11:00,205 --> 01:11:01,906
You don't need to learn
till you're in prison.

883
01:11:01,907 --> 01:11:04,074
I'll decide what
I need to know,

884
01:11:04,075 --> 01:11:05,309
And she's not
like that.

885
01:11:05,310 --> 01:11:06,243
She listens.

886
01:11:07,579 --> 01:11:09,046
That's her job.

887
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:21,258
Shit!

888
01:11:21,259 --> 01:11:22,459
My wallet!

889
01:11:29,034 --> 01:11:31,402
Damn it! Damn it!
Damn it!

890
01:11:35,607 --> 01:11:37,875
I can't believe it.

891
01:11:37,876 --> 01:11:39,309
Believe it.

892
01:11:39,310 --> 01:11:41,779
Your angel with
the dirty wings flew...

893
01:11:41,780 --> 01:11:43,614
Taking my wallet,
my luggage,

894
01:11:43,615 --> 01:11:45,282
My last cigar.

895
01:11:45,283 --> 01:11:49,486
She was so understanding
about my problems.

896
01:11:49,487 --> 01:11:52,056
Stuff your problems!

897
01:11:52,057 --> 01:11:54,375
<i>Stuff your problems.</i>

898
01:11:54,376 --> 01:11:56,260
If you weren't such
a spoiled little worm-

899
01:11:56,261 --> 01:11:57,929
Such a whining
little rodent,

900
01:11:57,930 --> 01:12:00,598
I wouldn't have had
to come down here for you.

901
01:12:00,599 --> 01:12:01,899
You asked for it,
and you got it.

902
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:03,067
True.

903
01:12:03,068 --> 01:12:04,268
It's not my fault.

904
01:12:04,269 --> 01:12:06,204
True. I know.
It's your mother's fault.

905
01:12:06,205 --> 01:12:07,672
Why is it her fault?

906
01:12:07,673 --> 01:12:09,740
Because
she gave birth to you.

907
01:12:09,741 --> 01:12:11,059
And what about
your mother?

908
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:12,493
My mother's a saint.

909
01:12:12,494 --> 01:12:14,295
For what,
having puppies?

910
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:18,533
Oh...

911
01:12:18,534 --> 01:12:20,435
Oh, you want
more, huh?

912
01:12:20,436 --> 01:12:21,836
Yeah, as a matter
of fact, I do.

913
01:12:24,039 --> 01:12:25,406
Come and get it.

914
01:12:31,529 --> 01:12:32,930
Chicken!

915
01:12:34,432 --> 01:12:36,734
Ah!

916
01:12:37,603 --> 01:12:38,669
Oh!

917
01:12:42,057 --> 01:12:43,057
Ow.

918
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:53,300
God, you're pathetic.

919
01:13:06,698 --> 01:13:08,465
Here's the deal,
dobsy.

920
01:13:10,002 --> 01:13:12,870
I had 200 bucks
in the wallet.

921
01:13:16,041 --> 01:13:17,742
You said
you were broke.

922
01:13:17,743 --> 01:13:19,076
I lied.

923
01:13:21,513 --> 01:13:24,749
You dishonest,
stupid jerk.

924
01:13:26,118 --> 01:13:28,819
We had money
all this time?

925
01:13:29,988 --> 01:13:31,656
We could have
been home.

926
01:13:31,657 --> 01:13:34,041
Probably,
but I had this plan.

927
01:13:34,042 --> 01:13:35,109
Yeah, I know.

928
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:36,176
No, you don't know!

929
01:13:36,177 --> 01:13:37,912
I know you were
playing around,

930
01:13:37,913 --> 01:13:39,463
Stretching this
whole thing out

931
01:13:39,464 --> 01:13:41,899
So we could get
to know each other.

932
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:43,734
And then it blew up
in your face.

933
01:13:43,735 --> 01:13:46,203
I blew it,
and I'm sorry.

934
01:13:46,204 --> 01:13:48,238
I'm also out of ideas.

935
01:13:51,342 --> 01:13:53,878
I'm just going to sit here

936
01:13:53,879 --> 01:13:55,863
And hope I get arrested...

937
01:13:55,864 --> 01:13:57,432
So I can get some sleep.

938
01:13:58,967 --> 01:14:00,768
Call your mother.

939
01:14:00,769 --> 01:14:02,603
Have her send somebody
for you.

940
01:14:02,604 --> 01:14:04,272
You can call,
can't you?

941
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:05,639
I don't want to call.

942
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:06,974
I'm sitting here,
and that's it.

943
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:08,976
You talk to your mom,

944
01:14:08,977 --> 01:14:12,046
You tell her
that I said good luck.

945
01:14:12,047 --> 01:14:14,415
Tell her the dutchboy's
calling it quits.

946
01:14:17,086 --> 01:14:19,053
You're dumping my mom?

947
01:14:19,054 --> 01:14:23,191
I'm sparing her of a life
of this kind of misery.

948
01:14:23,192 --> 01:14:25,743
She's going to blame me.

949
01:14:25,744 --> 01:14:28,429
I'll write a letter for you,
nice letter.

950
01:14:28,430 --> 01:14:30,331
Okay? Go on.

951
01:14:30,332 --> 01:14:32,450
I thought
you loved her.

952
01:14:32,451 --> 01:14:35,252
I've talked and talked
and talked to you

953
01:14:35,253 --> 01:14:37,454
Until I could puke
coat hangers.

954
01:14:37,455 --> 01:14:39,957
I'm me, you're you.
There's no reason on earth

955
01:14:39,958 --> 01:14:43,794
Why we should spend
any more time with each other.

956
01:14:43,795 --> 01:14:46,414
Okay. I just think
it's really sick

957
01:14:46,415 --> 01:14:48,116
That you'd cut
my mom loose

958
01:14:48,117 --> 01:14:49,683
Because you can't
get along with me.

959
01:14:49,684 --> 01:14:52,653
Why? You hate her.

960
01:14:54,305 --> 01:14:56,407
Don't fret.
It's okay.

961
01:14:56,408 --> 01:14:58,843
She puts up with your crap,
she can handle mine.

962
01:14:58,844 --> 01:15:00,678
I never said
that I hated her.

963
01:15:00,679 --> 01:15:02,480
No. Gee, I'm sorry.

964
01:15:02,481 --> 01:15:05,349
You're the picture-
is-worth-1,000-words guy.

965
01:15:05,350 --> 01:15:08,118
Yeah. Now, go on.
Go on. Make your call.

966
01:15:08,119 --> 01:15:09,820
Give me some peace.

967
01:15:09,821 --> 01:15:12,322
I don't
hate my mother...

968
01:15:12,323 --> 01:15:14,091
For the record.

969
01:15:14,092 --> 01:15:15,793
Kiss my ass,
for the record!

970
01:15:18,129 --> 01:15:20,931
Act like a rodent
around somebody else.

971
01:15:20,932 --> 01:15:23,834
You've busted my balls.
Congratulations.

972
01:15:23,835 --> 01:15:25,469
Go on.

973
01:15:36,981 --> 01:15:39,283
Did she ever say that
she thinks I hate her?

974
01:16:08,697 --> 01:16:10,064
I got it.

975
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:12,567
Hello?

976
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:15,836
Is-is mr. Standish in?

977
01:16:15,837 --> 01:16:18,072
he's sleeping.

978
01:16:18,073 --> 01:16:19,073
Who's this?

979
01:16:40,879 --> 01:16:42,563
Mmm.

980
01:16:42,564 --> 01:16:43,931
Who was it?

981
01:16:46,568 --> 01:16:47,802
Some kid.

982
01:17:11,093 --> 01:17:12,326
Come on.

983
01:17:13,461 --> 01:17:16,113
We can make it home.

984
01:17:16,114 --> 01:17:17,948
We got this far,
didn't we?

985
01:17:26,090 --> 01:17:27,591
Where you going?

986
01:17:27,592 --> 01:17:28,592
Home.

987
01:17:28,593 --> 01:17:30,060
How?

988
01:17:30,061 --> 01:17:32,095
I'm calling your mom.
Enough of this.

989
01:17:32,096 --> 01:17:33,597
Wait a minute.

990
01:17:33,598 --> 01:17:37,484
It would really
mean a lot to me...

991
01:17:37,485 --> 01:17:40,521
To not have to call
my mother for help.

992
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:47,477
You remember this?

993
01:17:47,478 --> 01:17:49,212
I still owe you one.

994
01:17:49,213 --> 01:17:51,248
You let me call your mom,
I forget about it.

995
01:17:51,249 --> 01:17:52,616
No dice.

996
01:17:52,617 --> 01:17:53,984
This isn't working out.

997
01:17:53,985 --> 01:17:55,920
We're not masters
of the highway.

998
01:17:55,921 --> 01:17:57,922
We were robbed
by home-bound hookers.

999
01:17:57,923 --> 01:18:01,291
Only because you fell
asleep, and I got...

1000
01:18:03,361 --> 01:18:05,662
Horny.

1001
01:18:12,437 --> 01:18:13,671
You did?

1002
01:18:13,672 --> 01:18:15,039
Sort of.

1003
01:18:20,211 --> 01:18:21,812
Congratulations.

1004
01:18:24,049 --> 01:18:25,382
Slap it.

1005
01:18:27,218 --> 01:18:28,619
There you go.

1006
01:18:30,689 --> 01:18:33,624
See, I'm not such
a bad guy, huh?

1007
01:18:33,625 --> 01:18:35,960
Yeah. Yeah,
you are, but...

1008
01:18:35,961 --> 01:18:38,361
I'm still going
to get you home.

1009
01:18:50,575 --> 01:18:53,510
 everybody knows
you been steppin' on my toes 

1010
01:18:53,511 --> 01:18:56,080
 and I'm gettin'
pretty tired of it 

1011
01:18:56,081 --> 01:18:58,215
 you keep-a
steppin' outta line 

1012
01:18:58,216 --> 01:19:00,017
 and-a messin'
with my mind 

1013
01:19:00,018 --> 01:19:02,953
 if you had any sense,
you'd quit 

1014
01:19:02,954 --> 01:19:04,822
 ever since you were
a little bitty... 

1015
01:19:16,401 --> 01:19:18,602
Uhh!

1016
01:19:18,603 --> 01:19:19,569
We're here.

1017
01:19:21,539 --> 01:19:22,772
Where?

1018
01:19:22,773 --> 01:19:24,074
I don't know.

1019
01:19:41,309 --> 01:19:43,176
There's got to be a-

1020
01:19:43,177 --> 01:19:45,613
There's got to be a guard
around here somewhere.

1021
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:47,415
We'll ask him.

1022
01:19:47,416 --> 01:19:48,432
Get out of here.

1023
01:19:48,433 --> 01:19:50,067
Aah.

1024
01:19:50,068 --> 01:19:51,568
Don't come back.

1025
01:19:51,569 --> 01:19:53,703
Heh heh heh.

1026
01:20:00,578 --> 01:20:02,312
Ohh.

1027
01:20:02,313 --> 01:20:03,880
I could sue you
for this.

1028
01:20:03,881 --> 01:20:05,999
Ohh...

1029
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,903
Dutch: Hey,
the kid doesn't mean it.

1030
01:20:08,904 --> 01:20:11,888
I do so.
And you can't hit me

1031
01:20:11,889 --> 01:20:13,457
'cause I'm a minor.

1032
01:20:13,458 --> 01:20:15,592
Ha ha ha ha.

1033
01:20:15,593 --> 01:20:16,560
Ohh!

1034
01:20:16,561 --> 01:20:19,229
Aah! Aah!

1035
01:20:19,230 --> 01:20:21,182
Hey, hey.

1036
01:20:21,183 --> 01:20:22,582
Hey, you okay?

1037
01:20:22,583 --> 01:20:24,051
Hey, I told
you guys-

1038
01:20:24,052 --> 01:20:25,752
What the hell
is wrong with you?!

1039
01:20:25,753 --> 01:20:27,487
What the hell-
we don't want any trouble.

1040
01:20:27,488 --> 01:20:28,823
Hey!

1041
01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:31,108
Relax, all right?
Why don't you guys

1042
01:20:31,109 --> 01:20:33,110
Go inside and we'll
hit the road, all right?

1043
01:20:33,111 --> 01:20:33,928
Uhh!
Aah!

1044
01:20:35,746 --> 01:20:37,114
Get away from him!

1045
01:20:37,115 --> 01:20:38,115
Yeah, yeah.

1046
01:20:38,116 --> 01:20:40,284
Uhh!
Uhh!

1047
01:20:40,285 --> 01:20:41,902
I said, leave him alone!

1048
01:20:41,903 --> 01:20:44,204
Knock it off!
You-

1049
01:20:44,205 --> 01:20:45,773
Get your tail
out of here!

1050
01:20:45,774 --> 01:20:47,374
You're outnumbered
now, boy.

1051
01:20:49,927 --> 01:20:52,362
All right, kid.

1052
01:21:02,006 --> 01:21:03,173
Heh heh heh.

1053
01:21:03,174 --> 01:21:06,476
Haaaaaah!

1054
01:21:06,477 --> 01:21:08,212
Uhh!

1055
01:21:08,213 --> 01:21:09,446
Hyah!

1056
01:21:10,782 --> 01:21:11,715
Uhh!
Ohh!

1057
01:21:13,818 --> 01:21:15,185
Uhh!
Oh!

1058
01:21:19,257 --> 01:21:20,174
Whew.

1059
01:21:20,175 --> 01:21:21,909
Oh.

1060
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:22,877
Are you okay?

1061
01:21:22,878 --> 01:21:24,879
Ooh. We're gonna
get you, kid!

1062
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:26,079
Yeah.

1063
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:30,734
You got me mad now.
You really got me-

1064
01:21:30,735 --> 01:21:32,802
Dutch: Doyle,
listen, listen...

1065
01:21:32,803 --> 01:21:34,838
I'll make you
eat that gun.

1066
01:21:34,839 --> 01:21:37,174
Dutch: All right,
now you guys really did it.

1067
01:21:37,175 --> 01:21:38,675
You got him angry.

1068
01:21:38,676 --> 01:21:41,678
Pete, let's go. You
don't have to shoot 'em.

1069
01:21:41,679 --> 01:21:45,649
Pete... You don't
have to shoot 'em!

1070
01:21:45,650 --> 01:21:47,251
You don't have
to shoot 'em, pete.

1071
01:21:47,252 --> 01:21:49,153
The kid is crazy.

1072
01:21:49,154 --> 01:21:53,090
Don't be crazy, pete.

1073
01:21:53,091 --> 01:21:56,393
Tell the voices that
you just killed somebody.

1074
01:21:56,394 --> 01:21:59,546
You know, that guy.
You just killed somebody!

1075
01:21:59,547 --> 01:22:00,480
Yeah!

1076
01:22:03,385 --> 01:22:06,420
Uhh! Ohh,
I just killed somebody!

1077
01:22:06,421 --> 01:22:08,022
He just killed
somebody.

1078
01:22:08,023 --> 01:22:09,957
Oh. They won't listen.

1079
01:22:09,958 --> 01:22:11,458
Don't shoot me.

1080
01:22:11,459 --> 01:22:12,793
I gotta do it.

1081
01:22:12,794 --> 01:22:14,728
I gotta get rid
of the voices!

1082
01:22:14,729 --> 01:22:16,730
Listen, listen,
it's the holiday season.

1083
01:22:16,731 --> 01:22:18,465
These guys probably
got families.

1084
01:22:18,466 --> 01:22:20,534
I do! I do!
He's single.

1085
01:22:20,535 --> 01:22:21,802
Why'd you say that?

1086
01:22:21,803 --> 01:22:23,637
Now I gotta kill
your families, too.

1087
01:22:23,638 --> 01:22:25,973
Dutch: Oh, no. Calm down,
pete. Look, forget these guys.

1088
01:22:25,974 --> 01:22:27,958
We'll find some nice motel
you can burn down.

1089
01:22:31,462 --> 01:22:33,697
Yeah. Motel.
Lots of people.

1090
01:22:36,567 --> 01:22:37,935
Okay.

1091
01:22:37,936 --> 01:22:39,970
You guys are very lucky.

1092
01:22:39,971 --> 01:22:43,640
Kid hardly ever backs off
once he gets his neck up.

1093
01:22:43,641 --> 01:22:46,710
So long, guys.

1094
01:23:00,274 --> 01:23:01,408
Excuse me,

1095
01:23:01,409 --> 01:23:03,977
But would you please
get out of here?

1096
01:23:03,978 --> 01:23:05,663
This isn't a warming
house, you know.

1097
01:23:05,664 --> 01:23:07,665
The boy has a wound
on his head.

1098
01:23:07,666 --> 01:23:09,900
We need to use
the restroom.

1099
01:23:09,901 --> 01:23:12,736
I'm so sorry, but
from time to time,

1100
01:23:12,737 --> 01:23:15,172
These... Road people
wander in.

1101
01:23:15,173 --> 01:23:17,007
Excuse me.

1102
01:23:18,476 --> 01:23:19,510
I said out.

1103
01:23:19,511 --> 01:23:21,011
Can he wash his face?

1104
01:23:21,012 --> 01:23:22,313
No!

1105
01:23:22,314 --> 01:23:24,248
I'll go outside.
Let him use the bathroom.

1106
01:23:24,249 --> 01:23:26,283
Robert, you want
to come over here

1107
01:23:26,284 --> 01:23:27,451
And help me?

1108
01:23:29,955 --> 01:23:31,555
Excuse us.

1109
01:23:31,556 --> 01:23:35,059
Excuse me, sir.
You're on the road?

1110
01:23:35,060 --> 01:23:36,359
Yeah. Why?

1111
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:38,528
The boy's your son?

1112
01:23:41,365 --> 01:23:42,633
That's right.

1113
01:23:42,634 --> 01:23:45,836
We're up from georgia
on our way to chicago.

1114
01:23:45,837 --> 01:23:47,771
Lost our car.
We got robbed.

1115
01:23:47,772 --> 01:23:48,839
Oh, god.

1116
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:49,974
It's all right.

1117
01:23:59,918 --> 01:24:02,486
They'll take good
care of you here.

1118
01:24:02,487 --> 01:24:03,887
Who?

1119
01:24:03,888 --> 01:24:07,725
This is a center
for displaced families.

1120
01:24:07,726 --> 01:24:11,161
Mike's supervisor
is on the board.

1121
01:24:11,162 --> 01:24:13,530
So, good luck,
all right?

1122
01:24:13,531 --> 01:24:15,266
Don't give up.

1123
01:24:15,267 --> 01:24:15,916
Okay.

1124
01:24:17,585 --> 01:24:19,703
Have a little faith
in your father.

1125
01:24:19,704 --> 01:24:21,688
He's doing
his best, okay?

1126
01:24:21,689 --> 01:24:24,525
All right. Bye-bye.
Let's go, hon.

1127
01:24:26,060 --> 01:24:27,427
Bye-bye.

1128
01:24:35,103 --> 01:24:38,622
And, uh, all our best
for a happy holiday.

1129
01:26:17,021 --> 01:26:19,890
Would you like to see
the wine list?

1130
01:26:37,992 --> 01:26:39,359
That's mine.

1131
01:27:06,271 --> 01:27:08,471
You can have it.

1132
01:27:20,551 --> 01:27:21,985
That was nice.

1133
01:27:36,784 --> 01:27:38,585
Jeez!

1134
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:50,881
Son of a-

1135
01:27:50,882 --> 01:27:53,249
You have to
click it.

1136
01:27:57,989 --> 01:27:59,139
Is there a problem?

1137
01:27:59,140 --> 01:28:01,424
No, no, I got it.
Thanks.

1138
01:28:36,594 --> 01:28:38,529
Ahh, jeez.

1139
01:28:41,816 --> 01:28:44,450
Shh!
Shh!

1140
01:28:48,089 --> 01:28:50,456
Shh!

1141
01:28:55,896 --> 01:28:57,697
Woman:
It's all right now.

1142
01:29:12,780 --> 01:29:14,013
Doyle.

1143
01:29:14,014 --> 01:29:15,982
Switch cots with me.
Mine won't hold me.

1144
01:29:17,936 --> 01:29:19,702
How do you know
it'll hold me?

1145
01:29:19,703 --> 01:29:23,573
Because I'm 15,000 cheeseburgers
ahead of you in life.

1146
01:29:23,574 --> 01:29:24,674
Come on.

1147
01:30:05,816 --> 01:30:06,783
Hi.

1148
01:30:28,906 --> 01:30:31,574
You from hammond?

1149
01:30:31,575 --> 01:30:32,775
Chicago.

1150
01:30:35,980 --> 01:30:38,515
I'm from south bend
originally.

1151
01:30:40,084 --> 01:30:42,019
Came to hammond
to look for work,

1152
01:30:42,020 --> 01:30:44,754
Me and my husband.

1153
01:30:44,755 --> 01:30:47,090
He lost his job
in June.

1154
01:30:47,091 --> 01:30:50,027
Worked for one of those
auto part companies

1155
01:30:50,028 --> 01:30:51,395
That went broke.

1156
01:30:53,097 --> 01:30:55,632
We've been here
for about a week.

1157
01:30:55,633 --> 01:30:56,966
It's nice.

1158
01:30:58,969 --> 01:31:03,140
We was living out of
the back of our car.

1159
01:31:03,141 --> 01:31:04,574
That's kind of hard.

1160
01:31:06,210 --> 01:31:07,577
What about you?

1161
01:31:12,050 --> 01:31:13,616
We got here tonight.

1162
01:31:13,617 --> 01:31:15,419
You and your daddy?

1163
01:31:30,083 --> 01:31:31,584
Yeah.

1164
01:31:34,288 --> 01:31:36,856
Do you have a mother?

1165
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:43,863
But she's not with you,
though, huh?

1166
01:31:46,667 --> 01:31:50,036
Where's she at,
chicago?

1167
01:31:50,037 --> 01:31:52,706
Yeah.

1168
01:31:52,707 --> 01:31:55,375
And I bet you'd like to
be with her right now,

1169
01:31:55,376 --> 01:31:56,609
Wouldn't you?

1170
01:31:56,610 --> 01:31:58,211
Yes.

1171
01:31:59,513 --> 01:32:02,014
Yeah...

1172
01:32:02,015 --> 01:32:03,616
I would.

1173
01:32:03,617 --> 01:32:05,952
It'll happen.

1174
01:32:08,689 --> 01:32:10,223
Hope so.

1175
01:32:10,224 --> 01:32:14,527
That's all any of us
in here can do.

1176
01:32:14,528 --> 01:32:17,364
What?

1177
01:32:17,365 --> 01:32:18,565
Hope.

1178
01:32:29,042 --> 01:32:31,177
You better
get some sleep.

1179
01:32:31,178 --> 01:32:32,645
Okay.

1180
01:32:54,334 --> 01:32:55,368
Hey, doyle.

1181
01:32:57,571 --> 01:32:59,338
While you were
brushing your teeth,

1182
01:32:59,339 --> 01:33:00,573
I called your mom.

1183
01:33:00,574 --> 01:33:02,909
I told her we were
at the holiday inn

1184
01:33:02,910 --> 01:33:05,445
So she wouldn't worry.
Is that okay?

1185
01:33:06,847 --> 01:33:08,214
Yeah.

1186
01:33:08,215 --> 01:33:10,617
You know, 'cause I said
I wouldn't call.

1187
01:33:10,618 --> 01:33:12,452
No...

1188
01:33:12,453 --> 01:33:14,554
No, that's okay.

1189
01:33:14,555 --> 01:33:15,688
Good night.

1190
01:33:30,538 --> 01:33:32,539
Did you hear me talking?

1191
01:33:33,891 --> 01:33:35,792
No, not really.

1192
01:33:35,793 --> 01:33:38,128
Well, I meant it.

1193
01:33:42,032 --> 01:33:44,100
I appreciate it.

1194
01:33:58,816 --> 01:34:01,885
You still gonna shoot me
in the ass?

1195
01:34:07,959 --> 01:34:09,926
Yes.

1196
01:34:13,130 --> 01:34:16,933
Good night.

1197
01:34:25,876 --> 01:34:32,782
 beyond the blue horizon 

1198
01:34:32,783 --> 01:34:39,205
 waits a beautiful day 

1199
01:34:39,206 --> 01:34:45,695
 good-bye to things
that bore me 

1200
01:34:45,696 --> 01:34:51,668
 joy is waiting for me 

1201
01:34:51,669 --> 01:34:57,674
 I see the new horizon 

1202
01:34:57,675 --> 01:35:04,347
 my life has only begun 

1203
01:35:04,348 --> 01:35:09,819
 beyond
the blue horizon... 

1204
01:35:11,389 --> 01:35:12,488
That's them.

1205
01:35:18,195 --> 01:35:20,997
He'll be so happy
to see you.

1206
01:35:46,506 --> 01:35:48,340
Hello, natalie.

1207
01:35:52,997 --> 01:35:54,264
I'm sorry.

1208
01:35:54,265 --> 01:35:56,232
Were you expecting
the mailman?

1209
01:36:43,981 --> 01:36:46,483
You take care,
the both of you, now.

1210
01:36:46,484 --> 01:36:47,784
Now, you call
the office

1211
01:36:47,785 --> 01:36:49,118
First thing
Monday morning.

1212
01:36:49,119 --> 01:36:50,920
I'll see what
I can do for you.

1213
01:36:50,921 --> 01:36:53,656
Doyle, happy
thanksgiving.

1214
01:36:53,657 --> 01:36:54,657
Thanks.

1215
01:36:54,658 --> 01:36:55,658
Good luck.

1216
01:36:55,659 --> 01:36:56,659
Okay.

1217
01:36:56,660 --> 01:36:57,794
Happy thanksgiving.

1218
01:37:29,527 --> 01:37:31,027
Hey, buddy!

1219
01:37:31,028 --> 01:37:32,328
Surprise.

1220
01:37:32,329 --> 01:37:33,329
Huh?

1221
01:38:02,509 --> 01:38:03,743
Mom...

1222
01:38:44,267 --> 01:38:46,870
I'm sorry.
Could you step outside?

1223
01:38:46,871 --> 01:38:48,738
This is a family matter.

1224
01:38:57,481 --> 01:39:00,082
Why don't you say
good-bye to your mother?

1225
01:39:00,083 --> 01:39:02,001
Why don't you come
to my house?

1226
01:39:02,002 --> 01:39:04,771
We've got a lot
to talk about, huh?

1227
01:39:06,373 --> 01:39:09,341
I canceled an important
overseas trip

1228
01:39:09,342 --> 01:39:11,277
To spend
this holiday with you.

1229
01:39:11,278 --> 01:39:14,113
No, you didn't.

1230
01:39:14,114 --> 01:39:17,750
I called your house
and a lady answered.

1231
01:39:17,751 --> 01:39:19,018
You lied to me.

1232
01:39:19,019 --> 01:39:21,087
Don't talk to me
that way.

1233
01:39:21,088 --> 01:39:23,455
It's true.

1234
01:39:25,159 --> 01:39:29,061
You make up your mind
right now, doyle.

1235
01:39:29,062 --> 01:39:33,565
Are you coming with me,
or are you staying here?

1236
01:39:33,566 --> 01:39:35,234
Your decision is final.

1237
01:39:43,143 --> 01:39:45,111
I'm staying here, dad.

1238
01:39:57,174 --> 01:39:59,542
Well... Fine.

1239
01:40:07,117 --> 01:40:09,686
I want you out of here
by Monday.

1240
01:40:38,048 --> 01:40:39,148
Excuse me.

1241
01:40:46,507 --> 01:40:48,825
You wanted natalie
out by when?

1242
01:40:48,826 --> 01:40:50,642
Monday.

1243
01:40:50,643 --> 01:40:53,212
I'm sorry,
I didn't quite, uh...

1244
01:40:53,213 --> 01:40:54,196
I said-

1245
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:00,920
Ehh...

1246
01:41:02,556 --> 01:41:04,340
Friday?

1247
01:41:04,341 --> 01:41:07,593
Well, she's probably gonna
need a little more time.

1248
01:41:07,594 --> 01:41:10,863
Uh... How's 6 months
sound to you?

1249
01:41:10,864 --> 01:41:12,131
No problem.

1250
01:41:12,132 --> 01:41:13,900
And you'll be more
respectful to natalie?

1251
01:41:13,901 --> 01:41:15,334
Absolutely.

1252
01:41:15,335 --> 01:41:17,970
And you'll work on being
a nice guy with your son,

1253
01:41:17,971 --> 01:41:20,857
Because he still loves you.
He's a great kid.

1254
01:41:20,858 --> 01:41:22,959
He doesn't deserve
having his feelings hurt

1255
01:41:22,960 --> 01:41:26,228
Or his mind played with,
especially not by his dad.

1256
01:41:31,351 --> 01:41:33,185
I like him a lot.
I'm his friend,

1257
01:41:33,186 --> 01:41:35,121
But, see, I'm never
gonna be his father.

1258
01:41:35,122 --> 01:41:38,057
That's your job.
You better learn to do it.

1259
01:41:38,058 --> 01:41:40,259
Yes, sir.

1260
01:41:40,260 --> 01:41:41,544
Good.

1261
01:41:45,282 --> 01:41:47,183
Pleasure
seeing you again.

1262
01:41:49,152 --> 01:41:50,787
Happy holidays.

1263
01:41:50,788 --> 01:41:52,054
Thank you-

1264
01:41:52,055 --> 01:41:53,088
Thank you.

1265
01:41:57,260 --> 01:41:58,628
Heh.

1266
01:42:08,488 --> 01:42:09,872
Whoa!

1267
01:42:11,675 --> 01:42:12,875
I'm okay.

1268
01:42:24,021 --> 01:42:25,888
And here it is.

1269
01:42:27,024 --> 01:42:28,191
Oh, wow.

1270
01:42:28,192 --> 01:42:29,425
Thank you, dear.

1271
01:42:29,426 --> 01:42:31,560
- Isn't he a beauty?
- Looks good.

1272
01:42:33,797 --> 01:42:35,331
Uh, dave...

1273
01:42:35,332 --> 01:42:36,666
Yeah?

1274
01:42:36,667 --> 01:42:38,668
Before we start,
run in the other room

1275
01:42:38,669 --> 01:42:40,169
And get my coat,
will you?

1276
01:42:40,170 --> 01:42:42,271
I got something in there
for your mother.

1277
01:42:43,923 --> 01:42:45,992
Right now?
Yeah.

1278
01:42:45,993 --> 01:42:48,127
Can't it wait?

1279
01:42:48,128 --> 01:42:49,862
Well, it's something
very special.

1280
01:42:52,132 --> 01:42:53,099
Okay.

1281
01:42:56,703 --> 01:42:57,854
move over.

1282
01:43:43,083 --> 01:43:45,201
yikes!

1283
01:44:01,384 --> 01:44:03,519

give a little love 

1284
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:05,087
 have a little hope 

1285
01:44:05,088 --> 01:44:07,556
 make this world
a little better 

1286
01:44:07,557 --> 01:44:10,158
 try a little more,
harder than before 

1287
01:44:10,159 --> 01:44:12,495
 yes, do what we can do
together 

1288
01:44:12,496 --> 01:44:15,831

1289
01:44:15,832 --> 01:44:18,400

in the confusion 

1295
01:44:38,821 --> 01:44:41,357
 nothin' is makin' sense 

1296
01:44:41,358 --> 01:44:44,026
 for me and you 

1297
01:44:44,027 --> 01:44:46,629
 maybe we can find a way 

1298
01:44:46,630 --> 01:44:49,465
 there's got to be
solution 

1299
01:44:49,466 --> 01:44:52,134
 how to make
a brighter day 

1300
01:44:52,135 --> 01:44:53,869
 what do we do? 

1301
01:44:53,870 --> 01:44:55,971

 sometimes
it seems so much 

1308
01:45:13,723 --> 01:45:16,258
 what we go through 

1309
01:45:16,259 --> 01:45:18,827
 maybe if we
take the time 

1310
01:45:18,828 --> 01:45:21,830
 time to understand
each other 

1311
01:45:21,831 --> 01:45:24,500
 we can learn
to make it right 

1312
01:45:24,501 --> 01:45:26,368

 come on, take him
by the hand 

1328
01:46:05,475 --> 01:46:08,644
