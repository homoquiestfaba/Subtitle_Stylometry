Roofing sucks.

58
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:35,506
The suck-

It... The sun is so...

60
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:41,346
You can really see how beautiful everything is when you're up there.

61
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,934
And it's hard labor, and there's a certain fulfillment with hard labor.

62
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:48,394
- I really admire that.

63
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,480

64
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:53,316

Like where the aliens come down to Earth and invade.

67
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,492
And have it be real.

00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:04,619
- I love science fiction.

69
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,120
- It's not science fiction.

70
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,122
See, I think we as a society categorize it

71
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:09,707
so it doesn't mean anything.

72
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,752
That term just loses all meaning.

73
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:16,547

74

80
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:11,102
- Yeah, it was good.

81
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,564
- I thought some of the shots looked bad when the ship was landing.

82
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,315
Plus some of the sound was kinda bad.

83
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:17,817

- If you-

84
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:19,569

86
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:22,780
it would be really hard to hit you with a car.

Come on!

00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:10,308
So are you gonna go out dancing tonight?

377
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:11,768
- No.

378
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:13,102
- Why not?

379
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:14,938
- I got plans.

380
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:16,105
- Date?

381
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:17,023
- Huh?

382
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:18,191
- Is it a date?

383
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:19,484
- No.

384
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,612
- So you're not gonna go out?

385
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:24,280
- No.

386
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:26,991
[distant angry yelling]

387
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:32,956
[angry yelling]

388
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,166
- Joaquin! Stop it!

389
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,417
What is going on?

390
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:38,545
- This fuck! He tell me how to, uh-

391
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:39,504
[angry yelling]

392
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:42,882
- Shut up! Just be quiet! Stop it! Tell me what's going on!

393
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,509
- He tell me not to, uh...

394
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,426
put the spoons in the dishwasher...

395
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:46,553
- The spoons and the forks!

396
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:47,804
[angry yelling]

397
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:48,638
- Oh, shut up! Are you serious?

398
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:49,222
Just be quiet!

399
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:51,808
Shut up! This is about putting spoons in the dishwasher?

400
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:53,643
- I put the spoons in the dishwasher!

401
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:54,310
[water spray]
Hey!

402
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:55,270

[crying and sniffling]

406
00:31:55,913 --> 00:31:56,914
- Good night.
- Good night.

[TV program plays in background]
...construction in your own home.

412
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,555
Kinda "do it yourself" kinda crap.

413
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:14,807
Me and Barry like to think that there's two rules-

414
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:17,560
[TV]
...living creatures who produce light.

415
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:19,479
[TV]
[loud punch]

416
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:23,191
[TV]
...gives off 90% of its energy as heat

417
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,485
and only 10% as light.

418
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:28,571
[TV audio fades out]
[mystical music fades in]

419
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:15,118
- Hey, Brandt, can you turn that off?

420
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:16,327
I have to get some sleep.

421
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:18,287
[mystical music stops]
[TV audio returns]

422
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:20,039
- Sure. Sorry.

[door creaks]

428
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:04,375
- Hi, um...

429
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,252
Would you like some dinner? I have some left over.

430
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:07,336
- No.

431
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:08,129
- Um...

432
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:10,047
How about some tea? I just made some.

433
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,090
- I'm very tired.

434
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,093
- Um... chocolate chip cookie?

435
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:15,094
- I'm very tired.

436
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:16,095
- Oh. OK.

437
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,430
All right then. Good night.

438
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:18,014
- Good night.

439
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:19,307

[talk radio]
- You're for it, right?

444
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:00,473
[talk radio]
- Well, I... you know... I don't own a gun...

445
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:02,558
[talk radio]
- And that's the choice you make.

446
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:05,603
[radio shuts off]

447
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:09,357

[answering machine beep]

450
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:25,957
[voice on answering machine]
- Hi, Susan. This is Otto calling. Otto Maki.

451
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,458
The man who found you in the woods.

452
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:29,210
Just calling to see how you're doing

453
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,796
and to let you know I'd be happy to take you out to the woods

454
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:34,841
and show you where I found you that terrible day.

455

[metallic thud]

465
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:25,224
- Have you made any movies lately?

466
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,852
I could be in your next one if you want.

467
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:31,272
I mean, I could kill somebody, or I could get killed.

468
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:33,774
Or I could just be an extra.

469
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,860
- I don't think I need you right now, Barry.

470
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:38,029
- Well, keep me in mind.

471
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,865
How did you make that alien costume in the last movie?

472
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,199
Because that was really sweet.

473
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,869
- Just lots of junk that I threw together.

474
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:47,538
- Really? 'Cause it looked like it took you days.

475
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,124
How many square do we need?

476
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,042
- Eleven.

477
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:52,376
- They only sent nine!

478
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,587
- You told me to order nine, Barry.

479
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:57,089
- Hey, you dumbass! We only got...!!!

480
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:58,674
[groan]

481
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:02,261
[metallic thud]

482
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,568
...because I was in the FBI and we were taking out these kidnappers.

483
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,820
Not in, like, the Die Hard office building

484
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:22,698
but more like the Winstar office building that my dad used to work at, you know?

485
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:23,407
- Yeah.

486
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:25,326
[traffic noises]

487
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:32,124
- ...it was like George Bush and my brother.

488
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:34,335
Like first it was my brother and then it was George Bush.

489
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:35,836
And it was really crazy.

490
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:38,130
I was in love with Meg Ryan. In my dream, you know? She was like my girlfriend...

491
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:41,008
[Barry's voice fades out]
[mystical music builds]

492
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:54,105
Del! Green light!

[music slows down]

500
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,125
- Hey, hold up.

501
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:39,543
Hey! Do you live here?

502
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:41,504
- Man, just let him in.

503
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:42,463
- Just chill, dude.

504
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:45,049
What are you doing? What's your deal? Do you live here?

505
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,717
- Come on, man.

506
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:50,346
- What's his deal? Let's kick his ass.
[laughter]

507
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:53,516

[wet squishy footsteps]

517
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:18,392
- It's a great handgun.

518
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:20,936
Single-action. Semi-automatic. Easy pulling the trigger.
[Christmas music plays in the background]

519
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:24,023
Nine millimeter. Has fantastic stopping power.

520
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:25,024
[metallic click]

521
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:27,735
Many police forces use this caliber weapon.

522
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,199
[loud gunshots]

523
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,832

529
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:05,231
[somber music]

530
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:08,609
- They kept asking me if I'd seen you that day,

531
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:10,110
or any member of your family,

532
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:12,112
or anyone else walking around out here.

533
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,282
I don't know if they thought I was a suspect or not.

534
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:17,034
You'll have to ask them about that.

535
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:19,161
One scary day.

536
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,372
- They knocked me out right over there.

537
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:23,999
- Never caught 'em, huh?

538
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,376
- No.

539
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:28,754
- Hard to believe that something like that can happen right here.

540
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:31,799
You don't think about things like that happening in your own neighborhood.

541
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:35,177
That there are actually people like that walking around out here.

542
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:39,014
You're lucky to be alive.

543
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:44,937
It's unbelievable.

544
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:52,486
Right here.

545
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:53,946
Right here is where I found you.

546
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:56,532
First thing I thought was some raccoons had

547
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:58,826
dragged a garbage bag out here into the woods.

548
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:00,452
They'll do that.

549
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:02,579
You were wearing that outfit, remember, but then...

550
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:07,585
Didn't take me long to find out that wasn't any garbage bag.

551
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:09,837
God, I almost had a heart attack.

552
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:14,592
I didn't want to check and see if that person was dead or alive.

553
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:17,261
You were alive.

554
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:20,389
Ice cold, but you were alive.

555
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:25,060
God, there's not a morning that goes by that I don't think about it.

556
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:31,525
