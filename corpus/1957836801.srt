1
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,954
- Serena?

2
00:02:07,996 --> 00:02:08,997
- Yeah, hi.

3
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:11,198
- I'll be right down.

4
00:02:17,105 --> 00:02:18,363
Serena.
- Hi.

5
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:19,197
- Amber.

6
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:20,074
Come on in.

7
00:02:30,384 --> 00:02:33,913
We could take the stairs,
but this is slower.

8
00:02:33,955 --> 00:02:34,789
Old school.

9
00:02:35,857 --> 00:02:36,882
More fun this way.

10
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:47,460
All right, here we are.

11
00:02:47,502 --> 00:02:48,301
Go ahead.

12
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:51,939
- Wow.

13
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:56,744
Cool space.

14
00:02:59,981 --> 00:03:02,041
- So we're saving up money
to buy more furniture,

15
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:05,210
but I still think it's
super comfortable.

16
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:06,712
Here, let's sit down.

17
00:03:06,754 --> 00:03:08,690
Do you want water, a glass
of wine, anything like that?

18
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:10,683
Okay.

19
00:03:10,725 --> 00:03:11,592
- I hope you're okay with weed.

20
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:14,520
This is a pot-friendly
household.

21
00:03:14,562 --> 00:03:17,089
- I am
okay with whatever.

22
00:03:17,131 --> 00:03:19,058
- Serena, this is
my boyfriend Ben.

23
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,460
Babe, don't scare her off.

24
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:23,095
- Nice to meet you, Ben.

25
00:03:23,137 --> 00:03:25,464
- Hey, likewise.

26
00:03:25,506 --> 00:03:27,900
- Okay, so look, we've
never had a housemate

27
00:03:27,942 --> 00:03:30,368
or been, like, landlords before,

28
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,647
so forgive me if
I'm, like, scattered.

29
00:03:33,648 --> 00:03:34,874
But you seem really cool,

30
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,408
so why don't I show you around,

31
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,011
and, if you're into
it, then we can

32
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:40,880
do all the business stuff after.

33
00:03:40,922 --> 00:03:44,692
- However you wanna do it,
but I'm definitely into it.

34
00:03:45,727 --> 00:03:46,986
- Cool.

35
00:03:47,028 --> 00:03:49,021
- Business, that's
your department, babe.

36
00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:49,897
- Thanks.

37
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:53,291
Great, let me show you around.

38
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:57,195
So we have the kitchen
over here, obviously, duh.

39
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,964
But Ben is a little
bit of a clean freak.

40
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:01,967
- Oh, don't worry,
I'm a clean freak, too.

41
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:02,835
- Did you hear that, baby?

42
00:04:02,877 --> 00:04:04,369
- Awesome.

43
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:08,674
This is where Ben makes noise.

44
00:04:08,716 --> 00:04:10,375
- But I can use headphones
whenever you're around.

45
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:11,577
- Don't worry about it.

46
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:13,946
I'm out of the house
most of the day,

47
00:04:13,988 --> 00:04:15,246
visiting clients.

48
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:17,592
- Clients, really,
what do you do?

49
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:23,564
- I create art pieces,
little gem-filled bowls,

50
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:26,158
tailored to my clients' needs,

51
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,294
based on the metaphysical
properties of gemstones

52
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:32,740
and essential oils and spices.

53
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:39,839
I know it sounds weird, but
people pay big money for them.

54
00:04:39,881 --> 00:04:42,349
- Wow, no, it sounds amazing.

55
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:47,221
And this is my space.

56
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,459
- You're
an artist, too.

57
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:02,528
- Oh, I wish.

58
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,130
No, I make poster art

59
00:05:04,172 --> 00:05:07,166
for these goody,
low-budget horror films.

60
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:10,169
People can pay good money
for them, just not to me.

61
00:05:10,211 --> 00:05:12,171
To the celebrities at
the horror conventions

62
00:05:12,213 --> 00:05:13,973
that autograph them.

63
00:05:14,015 --> 00:05:15,348
- I love horror films.

64
00:05:16,551 --> 00:05:19,245
I googled you, I know your work.

65
00:05:19,287 --> 00:05:20,320
- Wow, really?

66
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:22,948
That's funny.

67
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,617
This is a personal
project of mine.

68
00:05:24,659 --> 00:05:28,187
I'm animating with
salt, but I've only shot

69
00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:29,831
like 10 frames of it so far.

70
00:05:31,265 --> 00:05:36,137
- Salt has really powerful
metaphysical properties.

71
00:05:36,737 --> 00:05:37,863
- Really?

72
00:05:37,905 --> 00:05:39,307
I use it because it's cheap.

73
00:05:45,847 --> 00:05:50,852
That is our room, not
presentable at the moment.

74
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:56,123
And this would be your room.

75
00:05:57,658 --> 00:05:58,784
- Wow.

76
00:05:58,826 --> 00:06:01,187
- It's a really cool space.

77
00:06:01,229 --> 00:06:03,354
Plus, the neighborhood is great,

78
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:05,566
once you figure out
which streets to avoid.

79
00:06:09,303 --> 00:06:13,532
So, I have to ask, where
are you living now?

80
00:06:13,574 --> 00:06:15,000
Why are you moving?

81
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:18,713
And can I get a recommendation
from a previous landlord?

82
00:06:19,881 --> 00:06:22,407
- Well, my situation is
a little complicated.

83
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:25,544
I was living with my boyfriend,

84
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:28,147
soon to be ex-boyfriend, and
I'm bringing up with him,

85
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:30,291
and I needed to do it
as soon as possible.

86
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:35,453
- Okay, well, what about
a friend or a client,

87
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:37,122
like anyone who
could vouch for you?

88
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:40,159
- My clients are
all super private,

89
00:06:40,201 --> 00:06:41,861
and all of my friends
are my clients,

90
00:06:41,903 --> 00:06:43,162
so I can't really,

91
00:06:43,204 --> 00:06:47,008
but I can pay you guys
nine months in advance.

92
00:06:53,748 --> 00:06:56,242
Thank you so much, Amber.

93
00:06:56,284 --> 00:06:57,885
I really love this place.

94
00:06:59,353 --> 00:07:01,013
And I promise not to burden
you with my boyfriend drama.

95
00:07:01,055 --> 00:07:02,681
- Oh, please, don't
even worry about it.

96
00:07:02,723 --> 00:07:05,559
I have had my share of
shitty breakups, trust me.

97
00:07:07,061 --> 00:07:09,889
- It's just such perfect timing.

98
00:07:09,931 --> 00:07:11,456
He's out of town for a week.

99
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:13,125
My friends are gonna
help me move in,

100
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:15,937
and he won't have a
clue where I've gone.

101
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:23,535
- Hey, can I ask you a question.

102
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:25,104
- Sure.

103
00:07:25,146 --> 00:07:27,172
- Well, it seems like
you know a lot of people,

104
00:07:27,214 --> 00:07:29,440
and you can obviously
afford the rent,

105
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:32,386
so why do you wanna
live downtown?

106
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:37,783
- I think I just wanted
to get as far away

107
00:07:37,825 --> 00:07:39,860
from my old life
as I possibly can.

108
00:07:41,095 --> 00:07:45,090
And I like you, I
like the vibe here.

109
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:47,168
It's conducive to creating art.

110
00:07:48,536 --> 00:07:50,930
I promise I will be
a good housemate.

111
00:07:50,972 --> 00:07:53,098
And we can inspire each other.

112
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,500
- I like that.

113
00:07:54,542 --> 00:07:56,769
All right, well, I'll
see you tomorrow.

114
00:07:56,811 --> 00:07:58,203
- Mm hmm.

115
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:04,076
- She seems cool, right?

116
00:08:04,118 --> 00:08:06,954
- Yeah, for a New Age nerd girl.

117
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:30,478
- It's so nice.

118
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:33,872
Oh, yeah, totally beautiful.

119
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:35,316
- I'll see you Monday, babe.

120
00:08:37,151 --> 00:08:38,577
- I hope you're not
leaving 'cause of me.

121
00:08:38,619 --> 00:08:40,946
- Nah, we have a
couple gigs up the coast.

122
00:08:40,988 --> 00:08:41,780
- Wow.

123
00:08:41,822 --> 00:08:43,282
- It's nothing fancy.

124
00:08:43,324 --> 00:08:46,185
You know, band in a van,
McDonald's and Taco Bell.

125
00:08:46,227 --> 00:08:48,120
- What's the name of your band?

126
00:08:48,162 --> 00:08:50,089
- The Cocklear Implants,

127
00:08:50,131 --> 00:08:53,234
spelled C-O-C-K, 'cause
we stimulate the ear.

128
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:57,671
Also, our cocks are more
cockly than the other bands.

129
00:08:58,572 --> 00:09:00,099
- That's funny.

130
00:09:00,141 --> 00:09:01,800
- Welcome to the 'hood.

131
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:03,470
- Thanks!

132
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:13,445
- Wow, these are beautiful.

133
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:15,256
- They're more than
just beautiful.

134
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:19,760
Each stone has its own
metaphysical powers.

135
00:09:22,463 --> 00:09:25,090
You know the esoteric
properties of amber, don't you?

136
00:09:25,132 --> 00:09:26,801
- Actually, I don't.

137
00:09:30,438 --> 00:09:32,431
- Amber attracts good luck.

138
00:09:32,473 --> 00:09:36,143
It transmutes negativity
into positive energy.

139
00:09:37,546 --> 00:09:38,379
Careful.

140
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,126
Careful with that!

141
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:03,162
That's the most
valuable thing I own.

142
00:10:03,204 --> 00:10:05,439
It's thousands of years old.

143
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:08,042
It was a gift from my ex.

144
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:11,378
- Kind of a freaky-looking gift.

145
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:13,914
- That's why I love it.

146
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:17,709
It's pretty out there.

147
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:20,846
- Right, well, I'll
let you settle in.

148
00:10:20,888 --> 00:10:22,047
If you wanna hang out later,

149
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:23,615
there's this really
good takeout Thai place

150
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:24,983
around the corner.

151
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:25,860
- Sounds great.

152
00:10:27,261 --> 00:10:28,362
Thank you so much.

153
00:11:30,659 --> 00:11:31,492
- Serena?

154
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:35,229
What are you doing there?

155
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:37,498
- It's a surprise.

156
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:44,796
- Were you like
chanting or something?

157
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:46,466
- Chanting?

158
00:11:46,508 --> 00:11:48,375
No, I was just singing
while I worked.

159
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,913
Sorry, I do that.

160
00:11:55,316 --> 00:11:57,184
- What is that?

161
00:12:00,555 --> 00:12:03,157
Oh, wow, it's beautiful.

162
00:12:05,694 --> 00:12:07,853
Wow, and it smells so good.

163
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:09,254
Thank you.

164
00:12:09,296 --> 00:12:11,558
- Black moonstone
for new beginnings,

165
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,959
amethyst and malachite
for empowerment

166
00:12:14,001 --> 00:12:16,563
of female energies and wisdom,

167
00:12:16,605 --> 00:12:19,499
spices and feathers
to lift our desires

168
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:23,277
in the air like
incense lifts prayers.

169
00:12:37,358 --> 00:12:38,192
Oh my God.

170
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:40,819
- Jesus!

171
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,360
- What do you want, Amber?

172
00:12:48,402 --> 00:12:51,372
What do you really
want from life?

173
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:58,112
- Hmm, I want to be an
artist and I wanna be happy.

174
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:03,809
And I wanna have
kids, eventually.

175
00:13:03,851 --> 00:13:05,052
Not right now.

176
00:13:06,521 --> 00:13:08,822
Yeah, what do you want?

177
00:13:10,491 --> 00:13:11,626
- Pretty much the same.

178
00:13:12,694 --> 00:13:15,963
Artist, happy, money.

179
00:13:17,599 --> 00:13:18,733
Don't need a man.

180
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:22,094
Maybe one child.

181
00:13:22,136 --> 00:13:24,564
But I hate the idea
of being pregnant,

182
00:13:24,606 --> 00:13:27,799
so if it does happen, I'd
probably wanna hire a surrogate.

183
00:13:27,841 --> 00:13:28,710
- Mm, yeah.

184
00:13:30,512 --> 00:13:31,870
- Or marry a woman.

185
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:34,039
- Ah, good idea.

186
00:13:34,081 --> 00:13:36,183
- Mm hmm, I'm telling ya.

187
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:50,989
Good morning.

188
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:51,823
- Hey!

189
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:52,659
You're an early bird.

190
00:13:52,701 --> 00:13:53,726
- I hope that's okay.

191
00:13:53,768 --> 00:13:54,893
I didn't wake you, did I?

192
00:13:54,935 --> 00:13:56,261
- No.

193
00:13:56,303 --> 00:13:57,104
- Cheers.

194
00:14:02,109 --> 00:14:03,935
- Mm, what is this?

195
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:08,874
- Secret formula, for
health and creativity.

196
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:10,108
- Huh.

197
00:14:13,555 --> 00:14:14,388
Hello?

198
00:14:15,724 --> 00:14:16,758
Yes, this is she.

199
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,720
Yeah.

200
00:14:20,762 --> 00:14:21,596
Of course.

201
00:14:26,768 --> 00:14:27,602
Okay.

202
00:14:28,969 --> 00:14:30,228
Thank you.

203
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,973
Thank you, yeah, bye.

204
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:36,835
Weird.

205
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:37,712
- What?

206
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:41,774
- I just got the
most amazing job.

207
00:14:41,816 --> 00:14:43,476
- That is fantastic.

208
00:14:43,518 --> 00:14:47,187
- Doing a poster for an
exhibition of your art.

209
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:50,415
You don't have to
do that, you know.

210
00:14:50,457 --> 00:14:51,917
- I didn't do anything.

211
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:54,219
I just told the gallery
owner that I'd moved in

212
00:14:54,261 --> 00:14:57,089
with an interesting
young poster artist.

213
00:14:57,131 --> 00:14:58,365
The job was their idea.

214
00:14:59,734 --> 00:15:01,068
- Well, cheers to that.

215
00:15:03,036 --> 00:15:04,138
- To new beginnings.

216
00:15:06,641 --> 00:15:08,041
- Looks like your
housewarming gift is working.

217
00:15:09,376 --> 00:15:10,678
- They always do.

218
00:15:20,889 --> 00:15:23,783
- All right, so I'm gonna start
with some still photographs,

219
00:15:23,825 --> 00:15:25,317
and then I'm gonna take
it all into Photoshop

220
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:28,153
and sort of manipulate them.

221
00:15:28,195 --> 00:15:29,388
It might take me a couple weeks,

222
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:30,889
but I think we're
gonna get something

223
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:35,093
that's totally classic and out
there all at the same time.

224
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:35,969
- I trust you.

225
00:15:37,371 --> 00:15:40,298
Smile or no smile?

226
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,233
- Don't do anything.

227
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:43,944
Just think crazy thoughts.

228
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,074
- Amber?

229
00:17:22,977 --> 00:17:23,769
Amber, what's going on?

230
00:17:23,811 --> 00:17:24,646
Are you okay?

231
00:17:31,285 --> 00:17:35,046
- Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry, I was
having a really weird dream.

232
00:17:35,088 --> 00:17:36,824
- You scared the hell out of me.

233
00:17:37,892 --> 00:17:40,085
- I should probably tell you,

234
00:17:40,127 --> 00:17:45,132
I have this anxiety disorder,
an overactive imagination,

235
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,959
and it's been better lately.

236
00:17:47,001 --> 00:17:48,426
I've been off my
meds for a year,

237
00:17:48,468 --> 00:17:52,297
but I still get these
really intense nightmares.

238
00:17:52,339 --> 00:17:53,206
- About what?

239
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,770
- I don't know, I
can't remember them.

240
00:17:57,812 --> 00:17:59,672
They fade so fast.

241
00:17:59,714 --> 00:18:02,642
It's like these bits
and pieces of my life

242
00:18:02,684 --> 00:18:06,353
all jumbled up into
this freaky dream.

243
00:18:07,689 --> 00:18:09,982
I'm sorry if I woke you.

244
00:18:10,024 --> 00:18:11,617
- Don't worry about it.

245
00:18:11,659 --> 00:18:12,794
Here, go back to sleep.

246
00:18:17,565 --> 00:18:18,533
I'll protect you.

247
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:42,080
Morning.

248
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:42,957
- Oh my God!

249
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:45,651
I'm so embarrassed.

250
00:18:45,693 --> 00:18:47,319
- Don't be.

251
00:18:47,361 --> 00:18:50,263
My sister gets
nightmares all the time.

252
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:53,626
And crawling into bed with you,

253
00:18:53,668 --> 00:18:56,037
I promise, is not gonna
be a regular thing.

254
00:18:57,972 --> 00:18:59,841
Unless you want it to be.

255
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,818
- Hey, guys!

256
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,629
I'm back!
- Hey, baby.

257
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:05,263
- Whoa, whoa, it stinks in here.

258
00:20:05,305 --> 00:20:06,866
- It doesn't stink in here.

259
00:20:06,908 --> 00:20:09,167
If anything stinks,
it's your dirty laundry.

260
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:11,470
- No, babe, it smells like
something died in here.

261
00:20:11,512 --> 00:20:13,447
What the fuck, man?
- What?

262
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:26,519
- What the hell is that?

263
00:20:26,561 --> 00:20:28,386
- It's Serena's art.

264
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:29,588
It's beautiful, isn't it?

265
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:32,533
- It's a gift for the house,

266
00:20:33,701 --> 00:20:36,470
for good luck and
new beginnings.

267
00:20:37,972 --> 00:20:38,906
- Smells good, huh?

268
00:20:40,007 --> 00:20:42,868
- Yeah, weird.

269
00:20:47,314 --> 00:20:48,474
- How was the trip?

270
00:20:48,516 --> 00:20:49,909
- Not bad.

271
00:20:49,951 --> 00:20:52,645
Played for some new
people, sold some merch.

272
00:20:52,687 --> 00:20:53,487
Want a T-shirt?

273
00:20:56,456 --> 00:20:57,759
- Sure.

274
00:21:13,808 --> 00:21:15,400
- Looks good on you, man.

275
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:17,368
Let me snap one for Instagram.

276
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:18,212
- No!

277
00:21:19,647 --> 00:21:21,173
No social media.

278
00:21:21,215 --> 00:21:22,340
- It's cool, babe.

279
00:21:22,382 --> 00:21:24,375
She's laying low
from an ex-boyfriend.

280
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:27,680
- Oh, okay, I get it.

281
00:21:27,722 --> 00:21:29,056
No problem, man, sorry.

282
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,831
- Serena seems kinda
weird, don't you think?

283
00:21:38,566 --> 00:21:39,967
- No, man, she seems cool.

284
00:21:41,401 --> 00:21:43,361
I thought you liked her.

285
00:21:43,403 --> 00:21:46,707
- I do, but she
is kinda strange.

286
00:21:48,142 --> 00:21:51,045
Just watch your step around her.

287
00:21:52,914 --> 00:21:54,481
- Aw, babe, are you jealous?

288
00:21:55,415 --> 00:21:56,217
- No.

289
00:21:57,518 --> 00:21:58,719
I don't care what you do.

290
00:22:01,722 --> 00:22:02,948
- Come here, you.

291
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:05,416
- Mm mm, not right now.

292
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:06,417
Let's do it in the morning.

293
00:22:06,459 --> 00:22:09,021
Come on, I'm exhausted.

294
00:22:09,063 --> 00:22:10,463
I feel like I took a downer.

295
00:22:12,432 --> 00:22:13,267
Goodnight.

296
00:22:14,936 --> 00:22:15,937
- Goodnight.

297
00:22:41,529 --> 00:22:42,588
- Shh.

298
00:24:01,943 --> 00:24:02,777
- Babe?

299
00:24:05,012 --> 00:24:05,846
You here?

300
00:24:08,082 --> 00:24:08,883
Amber!

301
00:24:12,186 --> 00:24:13,087
Fuck!

302
00:24:23,197 --> 00:24:24,497
Knock knock.

303
00:24:25,933 --> 00:24:26,767
- Oh, hi.

304
00:24:27,735 --> 00:24:28,569
Come in.

305
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:33,165
- Have you seen Amber?

306
00:24:33,207 --> 00:24:34,508
- She went to the store.

307
00:24:37,545 --> 00:24:41,248
Don't worry, she
doesn't know about us.

308
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:46,020
- Wow, so we really?

309
00:24:48,222 --> 00:24:51,449
Okay, man, we can't
be doing that, okay?

310
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:52,851
I need you to help me.

311
00:24:52,893 --> 00:24:54,987
I'm weak when it comes
to beautiful women.

312
00:24:55,029 --> 00:24:55,863
- Relax.

313
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,635
It's fun for us to
have a little secret.

314
00:25:05,773 --> 00:25:07,074
- Okay, but what was that?

315
00:25:08,976 --> 00:25:13,806
'Cause I never came like
that intense like ever.

316
00:25:13,848 --> 00:25:14,849
What were you doing?

317
00:25:16,784 --> 00:25:18,185
- Wouldn't you like to know?

318
00:25:19,487 --> 00:25:22,281
- Wouldn't you
like to know what?

319
00:25:22,323 --> 00:25:25,217
- Ben was just asking
me what you told me

320
00:25:25,259 --> 00:25:27,019
about your relationship.

321
00:25:27,061 --> 00:25:30,389
- Oh, come on, only good
things, right, baby?

322
00:25:30,431 --> 00:25:32,033
Come on, I got breakfast things.

323
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:45,304
- Hey, what's that green
moldy shit in the blender?

324
00:25:45,346 --> 00:25:46,747
You forget to wash it again?

325
00:25:50,251 --> 00:25:51,218
Whoa.

326
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,313
Cool, what is this?

327
00:25:54,355 --> 00:25:58,083
- Serena got me a gig doing
a poster for an exhibition.

328
00:25:58,125 --> 00:25:59,660
Sounds classy, huh?

329
00:26:01,162 --> 00:26:04,289
- Wow, Serena looks
freaking amazing.

330
00:26:04,331 --> 00:26:05,791
- She does, doesn't she?

331
00:26:05,833 --> 00:26:07,201
- I heard that.

332
00:26:08,602 --> 00:26:11,230
And that green moldy shit
is an expensive blend

333
00:26:11,272 --> 00:26:13,500
of herbs and
mushrooms handcrafted

334
00:26:13,542 --> 00:26:16,035
to promote health
and creativity.

335
00:26:16,077 --> 00:26:17,302
Finish it.

336
00:26:17,344 --> 00:26:18,604
Maybe you'll write a hit song.

337
00:26:18,646 --> 00:26:20,439
- Yeah, no thanks.

338
00:26:20,481 --> 00:26:23,742
I drink green shit once a
year on St. Paddy's Day.

339
00:26:23,784 --> 00:26:25,411
- Wow, you look sharp.

340
00:26:25,453 --> 00:26:26,287
- New client.

341
00:26:27,221 --> 00:26:28,213
Wish me luck.

342
00:26:28,255 --> 00:26:29,815
- Good luck!

343
00:26:29,857 --> 00:26:32,751
- And I didn't
get Amber the job.

344
00:26:32,793 --> 00:26:34,428
She got it on her own merit.

345
00:26:39,967 --> 00:26:42,103
And I do look amazing.

346
00:26:47,608 --> 00:26:49,343
- I see the way you look at her.

347
00:26:50,377 --> 00:26:51,679
- Come on, Amber.

348
00:26:52,713 --> 00:26:53,972
Don't be crazy.

349
00:26:54,014 --> 00:26:56,008
- Look, I know you sleep around

350
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:58,177
when you're on the road, okay?

351
00:26:58,219 --> 00:27:00,345
- What, no, who told you that?

352
00:27:00,387 --> 00:27:04,593
- But if you fuck her, that
would be really, really bad.

353
00:27:07,294 --> 00:27:10,097
- Babe, it is not gonna happen.

354
00:27:11,832 --> 00:27:12,666
I swear to God.

355
00:27:39,528 --> 00:27:40,361
Hello?

356
00:27:41,962 --> 00:27:43,030
Yeah, this is Ben.

357
00:27:45,666 --> 00:27:47,759
Oh, hey, yeah, yeah, of
course I've heard of you.

358
00:27:47,801 --> 00:27:48,637
What's up?

359
00:28:08,455 --> 00:28:09,857
Goddamn, goddamn!

360
00:28:11,258 --> 00:28:12,092
Goddamn!

361
00:28:13,294 --> 00:28:14,153
- Ben?
- Goddamn!

362
00:28:14,195 --> 00:28:15,988
- Ben, what's wrong?

363
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:18,257
- This indie label,
Ear Shot Records,

364
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:19,391
they just offered
us a record deal!

365
00:28:19,433 --> 00:28:21,528
- Oh my God, that's amazing!

366
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:25,297
- Plus a four week tour
opening for their hottest act.

367
00:28:25,339 --> 00:28:26,932
- That's amazing,
when do you leave?

368
00:28:26,974 --> 00:28:28,601
- Leaving today.

369
00:28:28,643 --> 00:28:31,069
- Today, really?

370
00:28:31,111 --> 00:28:32,971
- Come on, Amber,
this is amazing news!

371
00:28:33,013 --> 00:28:34,239
Don't make this a bummer!

372
00:28:34,281 --> 00:28:35,941
- No, no, it is, it is,
I'm happy for you, I am.

373
00:28:35,983 --> 00:28:37,176
I was just looking forward

374
00:28:37,218 --> 00:28:38,944
to having you around
for a little bit.

375
00:28:38,986 --> 00:28:41,079
- I mean, do you
wanna come with?

376
00:28:41,121 --> 00:28:42,790
Actually, the bus is full.

377
00:28:44,024 --> 00:28:45,259
I gotta go call the band.

378
00:29:01,408 --> 00:29:02,801
See you in a few weeks, babe.

379
00:29:02,843 --> 00:29:04,303
- Yeah.

380
00:29:04,345 --> 00:29:05,572
- Okay, we can FaceTime
every night, if you want.

381
00:29:05,614 --> 00:29:06,705
- Oh, please, I have
better things to do

382
00:29:06,747 --> 00:29:08,173
than watch you jerk off.

383
00:29:08,215 --> 00:29:11,043
- Hey, don't underestimate
the beauty of self-defilement.

384
00:29:11,085 --> 00:29:13,312
- What's this about
self-defilement?

385
00:29:13,354 --> 00:29:15,914
- Don't ask, it's stupid.

386
00:29:15,956 --> 00:29:16,790
- What's wrong?

387
00:29:18,058 --> 00:29:19,918
You're not taking
off again, are you?

388
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,920
- We're taking
off big time, man.

389
00:29:21,962 --> 00:29:23,355
Amber will fill you
in on the good news,

390
00:29:23,397 --> 00:29:25,791
and I'll see you in a month.

391
00:29:25,833 --> 00:29:26,701
Love you, babe.

392
00:29:28,369 --> 00:29:29,370
- Don't worry.

393
00:29:31,372 --> 00:29:33,165
I'll take good
care of your girl.

394
00:29:33,207 --> 00:29:35,042
- Awesome, see ya.

395
00:29:35,909 --> 00:29:36,910
Let's go, baby!

396
00:29:37,778 --> 00:29:41,015
Go, go!

397
00:29:42,783 --> 00:29:44,711
- You know when you love someone

398
00:29:44,753 --> 00:29:49,123
and you see them in this
certain ideal light?

399
00:29:50,491 --> 00:29:53,452
Then, one day, that
light just sort of shifts

400
00:29:53,494 --> 00:29:56,656
just like a tiny
bit, and you realize

401
00:29:56,698 --> 00:29:59,925
that maybe they
weren't who you thought

402
00:29:59,967 --> 00:30:03,161
they were or who you
were hoping they'd be.

403
00:30:03,203 --> 00:30:04,471
Does that make sense?

404
00:30:05,472 --> 00:30:06,898
- Ben.

405
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:09,434
- I feel like he
cares about his music

406
00:30:09,476 --> 00:30:11,103
more than me sometimes.

407
00:30:11,145 --> 00:30:14,106
- It took you that
long to realize that?

408
00:30:14,148 --> 00:30:17,017
He's an artist,
he can't help it.

409
00:30:18,952 --> 00:30:20,112
You wouldn't wanna
take that away

410
00:30:20,154 --> 00:30:21,556
from him, though, would you?

411
00:30:22,657 --> 00:30:23,490
- No.

412
00:30:25,426 --> 00:30:28,730
But I wish I could change
it just like a tiny bit.

413
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:32,592
- You sound like a
pouty little girlfriend.

414
00:30:32,634 --> 00:30:35,169
You don't need a man
to make you feel happy.

415
00:30:36,236 --> 00:30:37,505
You're an artist, too.

416
00:30:38,673 --> 00:30:40,974
Pour yourself into
your own work.

417
00:30:43,077 --> 00:30:45,103
- Yeah, you're right.

418
00:30:45,145 --> 00:30:45,946
Thank you.

419
00:30:47,481 --> 00:30:49,676
Okay, I think I'm
gonna go for a walk.

420
00:30:49,718 --> 00:30:51,310
- You want company?

421
00:30:51,352 --> 00:30:52,779
- No, no, I'm good.

422
00:30:52,821 --> 00:30:55,581
I'm just gonna smoke
some weed, clear my head.

423
00:30:55,623 --> 00:30:56,423
Thank you.

424
00:31:40,934 --> 00:31:41,935
Oh my God.

425
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:46,674
There's this really
weird guy outside.

426
00:31:47,675 --> 00:31:48,576
- Elias.

427
00:31:49,778 --> 00:31:51,970
- He's been watching
our building.

428
00:31:52,012 --> 00:31:53,947
- I promise, that
won't happen again.

429
00:31:55,249 --> 00:31:56,341
- How can you promise that?

430
00:31:56,383 --> 00:31:57,985
He knows where we live, Serena!

431
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:02,849
- I'll tell him something
that will make him stay away.

432
00:32:13,934 --> 00:32:18,939
- Wow, your eyes are
so magnetic and alive.

433
00:32:21,843 --> 00:32:24,102
I can't stop staring at them.

434
00:32:24,144 --> 00:32:27,414
- The camera gazes
into your soul.

435
00:32:31,118 --> 00:32:36,123
I yield that power to
a select few artists.

436
00:32:40,327 --> 00:32:42,320
- It's getting kinda late.

437
00:32:42,362 --> 00:32:43,964
God, we've been at this forever.

438
00:32:45,132 --> 00:32:47,894
We should probably go
to bed soon, right?

439
00:33:52,667 --> 00:33:56,094
Oh my God, that was.

440
00:33:56,136 --> 00:33:57,170
- Shh, sleep.

441
00:34:28,536 --> 00:34:30,304
- Hey.
- Good morning.

442
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:35,568
- So, things aren't
gonna be, like,

443
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:37,603
totally weird between
us now, are they?

444
00:34:37,645 --> 00:34:40,338
- Weird, why would it be weird?

445
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:42,182
We're both consenting adults.

446
00:34:43,216 --> 00:34:44,552
It was good, though, right?

447
00:34:46,688 --> 00:34:48,313
- Yeah, it was good.

448
00:34:48,355 --> 00:34:51,859
I mean, it was the
most intense like, pow,

449
00:34:53,828 --> 00:34:55,922
that I've ever felt.

450
00:34:55,964 --> 00:34:57,422
What were you doing down there?

451
00:34:57,464 --> 00:34:59,291
- Tickling your soul,

452
00:34:59,333 --> 00:35:02,003
the reservoir of
infinite joy and ecstasy.

453
00:35:03,071 --> 00:35:04,730
It's an ancient technique.

454
00:35:04,772 --> 00:35:07,633
- Wow, well, I'll have
to learn that one.

455
00:35:07,675 --> 00:35:09,468
But, seriously, you
cannot tell Ben.

456
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:11,804
I mean, you have to
swear he won't find out.

457
00:35:11,846 --> 00:35:13,881
- Amber, come on.

458
00:35:15,215 --> 00:35:17,944
You're not feeling
guilty about it, are you?

459
00:35:17,986 --> 00:35:19,152
I mean, for Ben's sake?

460
00:35:20,888 --> 00:35:22,523
I fucked Ben before
I fucked you.

461
00:35:24,257 --> 00:35:25,860
- You fucked Ben?

462
00:35:27,227 --> 00:35:28,495
- That's not what I said.

463
00:35:30,565 --> 00:35:31,791
- What?

464
00:35:31,833 --> 00:35:35,069
- I said you should fuck
Ben before he fucks you.

465
00:35:37,105 --> 00:35:37,905
- Oh.

466
00:35:40,975 --> 00:35:42,635
- Here, cheers.

467
00:35:42,677 --> 00:35:43,511
- Thanks.

468
00:35:44,612 --> 00:35:46,939
What's in these, anyway?

469
00:35:46,981 --> 00:35:48,874
Because it makes me fart
like a butt trumpet.

470
00:35:48,916 --> 00:35:50,208
- It's a good thing.

471
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:53,311
It's your body
expelling evil essences.

472
00:35:53,353 --> 00:35:54,647
- Ah.

473
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:00,813
- Hey, babe, what's up?

474
00:37:00,855 --> 00:37:03,082
- Hey, how's it
going over there?

475
00:37:03,124 --> 00:37:04,517
- It's going fantastic!

476
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:06,251
People are really digging us!

477
00:37:06,293 --> 00:37:07,653
- Damn it!

478
00:37:07,695 --> 00:37:08,796
- What is it?

479
00:37:09,997 --> 00:37:13,059
- Stay here, don't come out!

480
00:37:13,101 --> 00:37:15,027
No matter what you hear.

481
00:37:15,069 --> 00:37:16,327
- What I hear?

482
00:37:16,369 --> 00:37:17,830
- What, what's going on?

483
00:37:17,872 --> 00:37:20,900
No, no, take me with you,
just hold the camera steady.

484
00:37:25,345 --> 00:37:28,381
- Oh my God, it's her
ex-boyfriend again.

485
00:37:30,383 --> 00:37:32,186
- Turn the phone
around, let me see.

486
00:37:35,123 --> 00:37:38,784
- Elias, I told
you to stay away from me!

487
00:37:38,826 --> 00:37:40,653
I told you!

488
00:37:41,863 --> 00:37:43,321
- Jesus, do you hear that?

489
00:37:47,135 --> 00:37:48,561
- What?

490
00:37:48,603 --> 00:37:52,798
- Serena, she's going crazy,
like talking in tongues.

491
00:37:54,776 --> 00:37:55,968
- Babe, I can't hear anything.

492
00:37:57,645 --> 00:37:58,471
Put me out the window.

493
00:37:58,513 --> 00:37:59,805
Just don't drop me.

494
00:38:01,249 --> 00:38:03,341
- There, do you hear that?

495
00:38:04,552 --> 00:38:06,212
- No, all I hear is you.

496
00:38:06,254 --> 00:38:07,454
- Get the
fuck away from us!

497
00:38:11,759 --> 00:38:14,252
- Oh, fuck.

498
00:38:14,294 --> 00:38:15,855
- What is it?

499
00:38:15,897 --> 00:38:18,924
- I think I need to
get back on my meds.

500
00:38:18,966 --> 00:38:22,928
I'm hearing things, just
having crazy thoughts.

501
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:26,132
- Babe, let's talk
about that when I get back.

502
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:32,872
- She's coming back.

503
00:38:32,914 --> 00:38:34,140
Okay, I gotta go,
but I promise, Ben,

504
00:38:34,182 --> 00:38:36,274
I will keep it together, okay?

505
00:38:36,316 --> 00:38:37,109
Bye.

506
00:38:37,151 --> 00:38:38,409
- Wait, what?

507
00:38:43,691 --> 00:38:45,159
- That was amazing.

508
00:38:47,728 --> 00:38:49,989
Seriously, I wish I
had been filming that

509
00:38:50,031 --> 00:38:52,224
instead of FaceTiming Ben.

510
00:38:52,266 --> 00:38:53,267
- Glad you heard it.

511
00:38:55,503 --> 00:38:57,596
- What were you yelling at him?

512
00:38:57,638 --> 00:39:00,633
It sounded like
Greek or something.

513
00:39:00,675 --> 00:39:02,210
- Words he needed to hear.

514
00:39:05,378 --> 00:39:07,807
He won't be
bothering us anymore.

515
00:39:40,114 --> 00:39:42,440
- Amber.

516
00:39:45,753 --> 00:39:46,587
Amber.

517
00:40:11,812 --> 00:40:12,647
- Hi.

518
00:40:13,814 --> 00:40:14,649
- Hey.

519
00:40:20,554 --> 00:40:21,714
- Am I disturbing you?

520
00:40:21,756 --> 00:40:24,950
- No, I can't sleep.

521
00:40:24,992 --> 00:40:25,826
Come on in.

522
00:40:49,984 --> 00:40:50,776
Ow!

523
00:40:50,818 --> 00:40:52,878
Serena, what the fuck?

524
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,788
- You're pregnant.

525
00:40:55,423 --> 00:40:56,882
- What?

526
00:40:56,924 --> 00:40:58,550
No, no, I'm not,
I'm on the pill.

527
00:40:58,592 --> 00:41:01,395
- Trust me, you're pregnant.

528
00:41:25,419 --> 00:41:28,414
- Ben is gonna freak out.

529
00:41:28,456 --> 00:41:31,892
- Don't be so negative,
this is exciting.

530
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,587
This is what you wanted, right?

531
00:41:35,629 --> 00:41:38,632
- Yeah, I wanted it,
but not this soon.

532
00:41:40,668 --> 00:41:42,436
- Well, life is
full of surprises.

533
00:41:46,807 --> 00:41:50,244
This is for strength
and creativity.

534
00:41:51,979 --> 00:41:53,339
Drink up.

535
00:41:53,381 --> 00:41:55,441
You're eating for two now.

536
00:42:00,121 --> 00:42:02,348
That'll hold you til lunch.

537
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:05,584
I have an appointment, but I
will be back in a few hours.

538
00:42:05,626 --> 00:42:06,485
Bye.
- See ya.

539
00:42:06,527 --> 00:42:07,353
- Bye.

540
00:42:26,013 --> 00:42:29,074
- I miss you, Ben, I
wish you were here.

541
00:42:29,116 --> 00:42:30,843
- I miss you, too, babe.

542
00:42:30,885 --> 00:42:32,378
Hey, how's Serena doing?

543
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,320
- She's fine.

544
00:42:34,523 --> 00:42:36,081
Hey, you have a couple
days off next week.

545
00:42:36,123 --> 00:42:37,316
How about you fly home?

546
00:42:37,358 --> 00:42:38,459
I'll buy the ticket.

547
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,488
- I can't do that, babe.

548
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:44,189
You know, I gotta be
here for PR and shit.

549
00:42:45,166 --> 00:42:47,435
Come on, don't go Yoko on me.

550
00:42:48,869 --> 00:42:50,463
- Fine, whatever, I'll see
you when I see you, I guess.

551
00:42:50,505 --> 00:42:51,472
- Hey, don't be mad.

552
00:43:32,847 --> 00:43:34,139
- Ben?

553
00:44:54,228 --> 00:44:55,062
Serena!

554
00:44:57,798 --> 00:44:58,591
Serena?

555
00:45:13,682 --> 00:45:14,907
- Hey, babe, what's up?

556
00:45:14,949 --> 00:45:16,476
Hey, I can't really
talk right now.

557
00:45:16,518 --> 00:45:17,976
We're filming a video.

558
00:45:18,018 --> 00:45:19,053
- Where are you, Ben?

559
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:20,955
- Morrow Bay.

560
00:45:21,822 --> 00:45:22,814
Why, what's up?

561
00:45:22,856 --> 00:45:24,049
- I need you to come home.

562
00:45:24,091 --> 00:45:25,694
I need you to come
home right now.

563
00:45:26,894 --> 00:45:29,254
- Amber, come on, man,
we talked about this.

564
00:45:29,296 --> 00:45:32,958
- No, there's something
demonic going on.

565
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,402
Serena, she's not
who she says she is.

566
00:45:37,371 --> 00:45:38,830
- For fuck's sake,
Amber, just go to Kyser

567
00:45:38,872 --> 00:45:39,965
and get back on your meds.

568
00:45:40,007 --> 00:45:41,967
- She's really
freaking me out, Ben.

569
00:45:42,009 --> 00:45:44,278
I think she wants
to hurt our baby.

570
00:45:45,547 --> 00:45:47,072
- What?

571
00:45:47,114 --> 00:45:48,273
Amber, are you hallucinating?

572
00:45:48,315 --> 00:45:49,741
We don't have a baby.

573
00:45:49,783 --> 00:45:53,722
- Yes, we do, we do now,
our baby, growing inside me.

574
00:45:54,855 --> 00:45:55,956
- Holy shit!

575
00:45:57,925 --> 00:45:59,751
Amber, Jesus, I
mean, that's crazy!

576
00:45:59,793 --> 00:46:01,086
I thought you were on the pill.

577
00:46:01,128 --> 00:46:04,624
- I was, and I wanted to
tell you face to face,

578
00:46:04,666 --> 00:46:06,325
but I guess we're one

579
00:46:06,367 --> 00:46:08,769
of the 9% that slips
through the cracks.

580
00:46:10,538 --> 00:46:14,275
- Okay, I mean
holy fucking hell!

581
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:18,379
Okay, we can do this!

582
00:46:19,547 --> 00:46:21,406
Okay, you know, I mean
a lot of responsibility

583
00:46:21,448 --> 00:46:23,342
is gonna fall on you at first.

584
00:46:23,384 --> 00:46:24,943
You know, until we
can afford a nanny.

585
00:46:24,985 --> 00:46:27,714
I'm gonna be on the
road building the band.

586
00:46:27,756 --> 00:46:30,282
Hold on, hold on,
Serena wants to what?

587
00:46:30,324 --> 00:46:32,251
- She's freaking me out.

588
00:46:32,293 --> 00:46:34,786
She's acting so weird.

589
00:46:34,828 --> 00:46:35,954
- Weird like how?

590
00:46:35,996 --> 00:46:38,156
- She's been chanting
in her bedroom,

591
00:46:38,198 --> 00:46:41,159
and she carries this
giant knife around.

592
00:46:41,201 --> 00:46:43,804
It looks like it's out
of "Lord of the Rings."

593
00:46:44,773 --> 00:46:46,499
- I mean, that's not weird.

594
00:46:46,541 --> 00:46:47,966
She's just a
gothed-out nerd, babe.

595
00:46:48,008 --> 00:46:50,703
- And she keeps feeding
me that green drink.

596
00:46:50,745 --> 00:46:53,238
It's making me
sick to my stomach.

597
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,040
I think it's poison.

598
00:46:55,082 --> 00:46:56,676
- You should know
better than to be

599
00:46:56,718 --> 00:46:58,076
drinking that green shit.

600
00:46:58,118 --> 00:47:00,379
Okay, but, hey, everything's
gonna be fine, babe.

601
00:47:00,421 --> 00:47:01,313
You're gonna be fine.

602
00:47:01,355 --> 00:47:02,548
Just tell her to back off.

603
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:05,083
- This isn't funny,
Ben, it's not a joke.

604
00:47:05,125 --> 00:47:07,853
I found one of her
weird voodoo bowls

605
00:47:07,895 --> 00:47:09,930
in my underwear
drawer this morning.

606
00:47:11,065 --> 00:47:12,924
- Okay, yeah, that's
kind of creepy.

607
00:47:12,966 --> 00:47:14,694
- Yeah, and you know
what else is creepy?

608
00:47:14,736 --> 00:47:16,828
She told me that she fucked you

609
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:18,673
while I was laying there asleep.

610
00:47:19,907 --> 00:47:21,066
- What?

611
00:47:21,108 --> 00:47:22,834
Okay, that's bullshit, okay?

612
00:47:22,876 --> 00:47:24,470
That did not happen, I swear.

613
00:47:24,512 --> 00:47:26,706
- Yeah, okay, well guess what?

614
00:47:26,748 --> 00:47:28,173
I fucked her, too.

615
00:47:28,215 --> 00:47:30,342
And now everything's
really fucked up

616
00:47:30,384 --> 00:47:32,645
and I just need
you to come home.

617
00:47:32,687 --> 00:47:33,845
Come home now.

618
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:35,314
I will see you
when you get here.

619
00:47:35,356 --> 00:47:36,758
- Hold on, no, no, no, babe.

620
00:47:48,603 --> 00:47:50,839
- Amber.

621
00:48:22,537 --> 00:48:24,405
- What do you want from us?

622
00:48:25,439 --> 00:48:26,841
- I want what belongs to me.

623
00:48:27,709 --> 00:48:29,334
- What are you talking about?

624
00:48:29,376 --> 00:48:31,704
- Serena stole from me.

625
00:48:31,746 --> 00:48:35,273
Something precious and
infinitely malignant.

626
00:48:35,315 --> 00:48:37,918
Return it to me, and
balance will be restored.

627
00:48:39,386 --> 00:48:42,447
- Look, whatever is going
on between you and Serena,

628
00:48:42,489 --> 00:48:43,892
I want no part of it.

629
00:48:45,426 --> 00:48:48,696
- A stone figurine,
an idol of a demon.

630
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:54,234
You've seen it.

631
00:48:55,269 --> 00:48:56,796
- This is crazy.

632
00:48:56,838 --> 00:48:59,766
Get away from me or
I'm calling the cops!

633
00:48:59,808 --> 00:49:03,101
- Only you can save the
world from eternal darkness.

634
00:49:03,143 --> 00:49:05,446
Seize the idol,
and bring it to me.

635
00:49:07,047 --> 00:49:08,708
I'll reward you well.

636
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:09,584
- Wait!

637
00:49:14,188 --> 00:49:16,524
Tell me what the actual
fuck is going on here.

638
00:49:17,926 --> 00:49:21,395
- The less you know, the
stronger you will be.

639
00:49:23,865 --> 00:49:25,999
Your friend Serena is
possessed by a demon.

640
00:49:27,702 --> 00:49:29,127
- A demon?

641
00:49:29,169 --> 00:49:31,464
- Lay salt across
your thresholds.

642
00:49:31,506 --> 00:49:33,633
An unbroken line of salt
will hold it at bay.

643
00:49:33,675 --> 00:49:36,043
Now, bring the idol to
me as quick as you can.

644
00:49:37,211 --> 00:49:39,581
And I swear to you,
all will be forgiven.

645
00:50:06,741 --> 00:50:09,201
- What did you tell her?

646
00:50:09,243 --> 00:50:11,537
- Nothing, I swear.

647
00:50:11,579 --> 00:50:13,873
- You dare betray me?

648
00:50:13,915 --> 00:50:15,407
- No, Serena!

649
00:51:53,447 --> 00:51:54,674
- What's going on?

650
00:51:58,251 --> 00:52:00,046
Are you okay?

651
00:52:00,088 --> 00:52:01,581
Amber.

652
00:52:01,623 --> 00:52:02,957
Hey, talk to me.

653
00:52:27,048 --> 00:52:29,976
Amber, what is wrong?

654
00:52:31,919 --> 00:52:32,754
Open the door.

655
00:52:33,821 --> 00:52:36,082
- Stay away from me!

656
00:52:36,124 --> 00:52:38,050
Help, somebody, help!

657
00:52:42,964 --> 00:52:45,725
- Open the door,
you fucking bitch!

658
00:52:47,669 --> 00:52:49,795
- Get out of my house!

659
00:52:49,837 --> 00:52:51,564
I know what you are!

660
00:53:24,337 --> 00:53:26,364
Hey, it's Ben, hit me.

661
00:53:26,406 --> 00:53:29,476
- Ben, Ben, it's me, please,
please, call me, please!

662
00:53:30,477 --> 00:53:32,672
- You fucking cunt.

663
00:53:32,714 --> 00:53:34,849
Return what you stole from me

664
00:53:36,316 --> 00:53:39,177
or I'll rip the
child from your womb

665
00:53:39,219 --> 00:53:40,788
and stuff it down your throat!

666
00:53:42,156 --> 00:53:43,883
911, what's your emergency?

667
00:53:43,925 --> 00:53:45,084
- No one can help you.

668
00:53:45,126 --> 00:53:47,987
Give me the idol or suffer.

669
00:54:48,556 --> 00:54:49,690
- What the fuck?

670
00:54:51,358 --> 00:54:52,193
Amber?

671
00:54:54,427 --> 00:54:55,530
Babe, are you in here?

672
00:54:57,999 --> 00:54:59,424
Amber!

673
00:55:03,771 --> 00:55:04,964
Serena, where's Amber?

674
00:55:05,006 --> 00:55:06,999
- She's in her room,
acting really strange.

675
00:55:07,041 --> 00:55:08,366
She locked the door
and won't come out.

676
00:55:08,408 --> 00:55:09,710
- Oh, Jesus.

677
00:55:12,914 --> 00:55:13,706
Amber?

678
00:55:13,748 --> 00:55:15,340
What's going on, babe?

679
00:55:17,317 --> 00:55:18,811
Amber, come on, open the door.

680
00:55:18,853 --> 00:55:20,278
- Ben?

681
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:22,690
Ben, don't listen to her!

682
00:55:24,025 --> 00:55:25,985
Don't listen to
her, she's a demon!

683
00:55:26,027 --> 00:55:27,418
- See what I mean?

684
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:28,921
She's delusional.

685
00:55:28,963 --> 00:55:30,856
- Fuck you, Serena, you're
a demon and you know it!

686
00:55:30,898 --> 00:55:32,224
- Amber, calm down.

687
00:55:32,266 --> 00:55:33,768
We're trying to help you.

688
00:55:34,635 --> 00:55:35,594
- Babe, chill out, okay?

689
00:55:35,636 --> 00:55:37,263
I'm gonna get the key.

690
00:55:37,305 --> 00:55:39,372
- No, Ben, no, no, no, no, no!

691
00:55:40,908 --> 00:55:43,769
No, please, please,
don't, Ben, please!

692
00:55:56,356 --> 00:55:57,616
- We need to calm her down.

693
00:55:57,658 --> 00:55:59,861
We can't take her to
the hospital like this.

694
00:56:07,068 --> 00:56:08,828
- Amber, babe, I'm
gonna unlock the door.

695
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:12,731
- No, no, Ben, call the
police, call a priest!

696
00:56:12,773 --> 00:56:13,899
She's a demon!

697
00:56:13,941 --> 00:56:14,834
Amber, relax, man.

698
00:56:14,876 --> 00:56:15,801
I'm gonna help you.

699
00:56:18,445 --> 00:56:21,073
- Ben, get in quick, quick,
but don't mess up the salt.

700
00:56:21,115 --> 00:56:21,949
- What?

701
00:56:23,416 --> 00:56:25,711
Come on, Amber, this is crazy!

702
00:56:25,753 --> 00:56:28,147
Come on, babe, let's
call an ambulance.

703
00:56:29,422 --> 00:56:31,817
- She wants to hurt our baby.

704
00:56:31,859 --> 00:56:35,988
- It's not your
baby, it's my baby.

705
00:56:37,198 --> 00:56:40,134
My egg, your seed, Amber's womb.

706
00:56:41,903 --> 00:56:42,728
- Ben!

707
00:56:44,038 --> 00:56:45,764
No, no, no, no, no!

708
00:56:55,249 --> 00:56:58,244
- This is the
blade for the sacrifice

709
00:56:58,286 --> 00:57:01,180
and our child.

710
00:57:02,990 --> 00:57:05,251
- Take it, take it,
just leave us alone!

711
00:57:42,763 --> 00:57:46,367
- Amber, what the fuck,
what the fuck, man?

712
00:57:52,273 --> 00:57:53,666
Oh my God, she's dead, man.

713
00:57:53,708 --> 00:57:55,042
- Calm yourself.

714
00:57:55,910 --> 00:57:58,446
Celebrate the sacrificial lamb.

715
00:57:59,613 --> 00:58:00,539
- What are you talking about?

716
00:58:00,581 --> 00:58:01,407
We've have to call the cops.

717
00:58:01,449 --> 00:58:02,308
- No!

718
00:58:02,350 --> 00:58:03,509
No.

719
00:58:03,551 --> 00:58:04,677
- We have a dead
body in our bedroom.

720
00:58:04,719 --> 00:58:06,078
We're fucked, man.

721
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:07,613
- I'll take care of it.

722
00:58:10,958 --> 00:58:12,418
- Amber, what's wrong with you?

723
00:58:14,729 --> 00:58:16,989
Amber, what the fuck!

724
00:58:17,031 --> 00:58:17,865
Amber.

725
00:58:21,068 --> 00:58:23,495
Amber, what the fuck!

726
00:58:23,537 --> 00:58:24,997
Oh my God, no!

727
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:29,368
Don't do that, Amber!

728
00:58:29,410 --> 00:58:31,804
Amber, what the fuck?

729
00:58:31,846 --> 00:58:33,214
- We're having a baby, Ben.

730
00:58:35,016 --> 00:58:36,775
I'm feeding for two.
