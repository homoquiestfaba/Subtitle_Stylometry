1
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,100
NO! Please no!

2
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,300
What happened?

3
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,500
He's been under a lot of stress
it was just finally too much for him.

4
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,300
NO! Please Daddy, NO!

5
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:21,400
In 1935, Dr. Dexter uncovered what has
become known as The Pnakotic Manuscripts

6
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,700
a series of scrolls that detail
what some researchers believe

7
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,600
is a history of a civilized
race that predates humanity.

8
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,300
While the Manuscript itself is under
lock and key at The Dexter Estate,

9
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,300
we have fragments of the manuscript
here at Miskatonic's own library.

10
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,500
<i>Sweet</i>

11
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,800
But don't get too excited;
they're in the Forbidden Lore room, and

12
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,800
we all know how difficult
it is to gain access.

13
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,800
Now, we've had some of the world's foremost

14
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,600
authorities on Primitive
Religions visit to study them.

15
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,600
A good reference easily
accessible to you is Blake's

16
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,800
"AStudy of the Pnakotic Manuscripts",

17
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,800
and that is available here at
Miskatonic's own library -

18
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,000
and all you need is a
student ID to check it out.

19
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,100
Can I help you, miss?

20
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:20,500
I hope so. I'm assuming from the slide
that this is Primitive Religions?

21
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,400
That's right.

22
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,300
I'm Asenath Waite.
I just transferred from Innsmouth.

23
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,900
Asenath Waite. You're Ephraim's daughter.

24
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,000
Uh listen, more tomorrow on
The Pnakotic Manuscripts, so do your reading.

25
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,200
Your father was my mentor.
He was instrumental in shaping my career.

26
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:45,000
I know. My father wrote of his
assistants frequently in his journals.

27
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:49,000
Although you weren't exactly
given a glowing review...

28
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,500
I believe his words were tirelessly mediocre.

29
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,400
Well. I was sad to hear of his passing.

30
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,500
Class starts at nine-oh-five, Miss Waite.

31
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:11,300
I look forward to it.
I'm curious to see how much you've grown.

32
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,200
What was that all about?
- I don't know.

33
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,800
Listen, I'm really interested in
seeing those Pnakotic fragments.

34
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,600
And I was wondering if you could sign
me off for the Forbidden Lore room.

35
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,300
I'll think about it,
the Manuscripts are pretty intense.

36
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,600
I'm not going to try anything.
But I gotta write my thesis on something,

37
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,300
and I'm interested in
the mathematical code...

38
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,300
Alleged mathematical code.

39
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,600
That was Ephraim's theory, you know.
The code.

40
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,900
So...?

41
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I said I'd think about it.

42
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,600
Hey there.

43
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,100
Hi.
Hi, Edward.

44
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,100
Hi.

45
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,400
Hey, Richie! What's up?

46
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,300
He got an A on his math test today!

47
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,300
Right on! I knew you could do it!

48
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,400
Thanks to you. It's nice having
a math genius for a tutor.

49
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,400
(laughter)

50
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,600
You forgot this.

51
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,100
I know, thanks.
What are we doing for dinner tonight?

52
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,300
Steak tonight.

53
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,700
Are you interested?

54
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,000
Sounds great.

55
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,500
Good. We'll see you around six then.

56
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,700
Come on, you.

57
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,400
See you tonight.
- Bye

58
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,400
Bye.
- Bye Daddy! Bye Edward!

59
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,800
Bye.

60
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,200
Don't you have a class?

61
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:29,600
Oh, shit! Uh, Okay,
I'll see you later tonight.

62
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,500
<i>What was he like?</i>

63
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:58,400
Ephraim? Intense. Arrogant. Brilliant.

64
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,000
He had a charisma about him,

65
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,100
a way of getting people to do
things that they didn't want to do.

66
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,700
He was very respected when
he came to Miskatonic...

67
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,000
highly knowledgeable in the Pnakotic Code.

68
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,700
He did his thesis on the Pnakotic Code,

69
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,500
trying to prove a mathematical correlation
between the Pnakotic language and symbols.

70
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:20,900
Fascinating.

71
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,400
I was lucky to be chosen as his assistant,

72
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,600
along with another student, Robert Black.

73
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,200
I got along well with Ephraim,

74
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,700
but he connected with Black
on a much deeper level.

75
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,000
Black was a brilliant student...

76
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,300
So what happened?

77
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,300
One night Robert Black just decided to
slaughter his entire family as they slept.

78
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,400
His parents, his eight-year-old sister,

79
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:52,400
his very elderly grandmother,
who lived in the house with them.

80
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:58,600
The rumor going around was that he tortured
the grandmother for hours before she died.

81
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,900
Jesus.

82
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:05,600
Ephraim resigned shortly after that,
with no real explanation.

83
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,000
Black claimed no memory of the incident
and was committed to Arkham Sanitarium.

84
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,000
So what happened to Ephraim?

85
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,100
He was put in Arkham as well.

86
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,500
Asenath was raised by his
live-in servant, I think.

87
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,145
Some people think that
Ephraim went crazy...

88
00:08:28,165 --> 00:08:30,700
...from what he learned in
the Pnakotic Manuscripts.

89
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:36,400
Personally, I think the Manuscripts
are hogwash, pseudo-science at best.

90
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,500
I think you'd be better served writing
your thesis on something different.

91
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,900
You're not going to sign me off
on the Forbidden Lore room.

92
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:49,000
No.
For your best interests, Edward.

93
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,400
<i>It's already been done.</i>

94
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:28,700
(laughter)

95
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,200
Come on - Asenath.

96
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,900
Come on - Asenath.

97
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,400
It's a little unsettling the first time.

98
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,300
Oh my God.

99
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,300
Hey.

100
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,700
Hey.

101
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,000
What's going on?
- Nothing.

102
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:18,400
Asenath can do this really
cool hypnotizing thing.

103
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,300
She can make you think you're
looking at yourself. It's wild!

104
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,700
Really?

105
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,500
It's just an illusion...
parlor trick my dad taught me.

106
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,800
Come on. Do it to him!

107
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,300
No.

108
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,300
Ah, come on. I want to see how this works.

109
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,700
It's really difficult.

110
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:48,000
What? I'm not susceptible
to your charms? You can't do it to me?

111
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,700
Alright.

112
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,400
Okay. What do I do?

113
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,700
Nothing. Just relax.

114
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:23,300
Holy Shit! What the fuck?!

115
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,300
Fuck me!

116
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,200
Edward?

117
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,400
What's going on?

118
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,500
Nothing.

119
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,500
I was just showing Edward
a little illusion I learned.

120
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,900
Yeah... it was nothing.
Uh, just a little trick.

121
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,300
Well, do you think you can
get those books I asked

122
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,500
for when you're done with your little trick?

123
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,800
Yeah. I'm sorry. They're right here.

124
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,400
Jeez, what's up his butt?

125
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,600
No kidding.

126
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,500
How did you do that?

127
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,900
It's just an illusion.
A kind of hypnosis.

128
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,900
No way.
That was no illusion!

129
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,200
I was in your body... looking at my body.

130
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,500
It's nothing,
just something my father taught me.

131
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,000
An old Pnakotic trick.

132
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,100
I'm looking forward to
reading your father's thesis.

133
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,300
I was thinking about writing
my own along similar lines.

134
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,100
Upton won't teach you anything, will he?

135
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,600
He won't let you go through
the actual Manuscripts.

136
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,800
He refers to it as pseudo-science.

137
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,800
He thinks I'm wasting my time.

138
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,000
That was always his problem...

139
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:13,800
never believed,
his disbelief made it impossible to...

140
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
You know, my father made many
contributions to this school.

141
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,800
I have access to a lot
of the forbidden books.

142
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:30,400
You'd be able to view
them whenever you wanted...

143
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,800
if you were with me.

144
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,600
Would you like to go out sometime?

145
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,400
I thought you were going
to show me something.

146
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,300
Watch and learn.

147
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,800
Ready?
- For what?

148
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,300
For this.

149
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,100
Oh. My. God.

150
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,000
Feels weird, doesn't it?

151
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,200
Jesus. I had no idea.

152
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,100
Can you teach me how?

153
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,600
Doesn't work with everyone.

154
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,600
And it takes a long time to learn.
- How long did it take you?

155
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,500
Twenty years.

156
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,900
Bullshit. What,
you started practicing in the womb?

157
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,000
Maybe.

158
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,100
Those things'll kill you.
Or haven't you heard?

159
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,300
Yeah. But I could always find a new body.

160
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,900
Man, don't even say things like that.

161
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,200
I could teach you this, and more.

162
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,600
But you'd have to keep it a secret.

163
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:12,800
Of course.
- I mean it. Nobody can know.

164
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,800
Especially Upton.

165
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,200
Whatever you say.
- Whatever I say?

166
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,000
Now this would also suggest that Dagon
played a prominent part in

167
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,000
doctrines concerning death and future life.

168
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,400
As to the ritual of his worship,

169
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,800
little can be gathered from
documents or scripture.

170
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,700
Most of their records were destroyed
with the rise of Christianity,

171
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,100
and The Order of Dagon did not appear again.

172
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,800
(cough)

173
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,500
Yes, Miss Waite?

174
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,100
That's not quite true.
In the early nineteen hundreds,

175
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:56,200
there was a revival of Dagon worshipping
here in Massachusetts.

176
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,000
I suppose you're referring to the

177
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,400
events prior to the naval bombing
of Innsmouth in the twenties.

178
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:08,100
There's no evidence to support that Order
had any ties to the original worshippers.

179
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,600
Several scholars do believe that.

180
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:17,100
In fact, it's been theorized that the bombing
was a response to the cult activities.

181
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,600
The bombing was a result
of a federal crackdown

182
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:24,500
on a huge organized crime-ring that
had ties to Asian shipping magnates.

183
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:32,800
The Order of Dagon - if it even existed -
was a front for laundering stolen artifacts.

184
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:38,300
You can research all of this in Gilman's
excellent "Shadows Over Innsmouth".

185
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,900
Rubbish. Gilman's account
was clearly a cover-up.

186
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,400
Most historians are unaware
of the inconsistencies

187
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,400
between his story and the
events as they transpired.

188
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,400
You act as if you were there, Miss Waite.

189
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,000
Whatever happened,
happened over eighty years ago.

190
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,900
Would you ask me to believe that
someone born sixty-some-odd years

191
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,600
after the fact has a clearer interpretation
than someone who survived the events?

192
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:20,600
Okay. For next week I want everyone ready
for the test on South Pacific religions.

193
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,100
Sarah wanted me to invite
you to dinner tonight.

194
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,900
It's been weeks since you've been by...
she's making some kind of a salmon-thing.

195
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,400
I can't tonight. I've got plans.

196
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,500
Tell her thanks, though.
- Sure.

197
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,700
(knocking)

198
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,100
(knocking)

199
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,100
Mr. Derby! Come on in!

200
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,500
Clive, please.
- Ok, Clive.

201
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,200
I was hoping I could talk with you a
bit, Professor.

202
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,300
Well certainly, as long as we drop
the professor and call me Dan.

203
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,200
Listen Dan,
I came to talk to you about Edward.

204
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,300
Okay. Um, come on in.

205
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,900
Is everything alright?

206
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,500
You are aware of his relationship
with the Waite girl?

207
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,100
Asenath, yes... I...

208
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,300
Did you know that they're getting married?

209
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:59,000
What? No... I...

210
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,000
You may have heard my wife's very ill,
and this isn't helping.

211
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,664
Asenath's father
and I did not get along.

212
00:19:04,684 --> 00:19:07,100
I was on the board
when he was forced to resign.

213
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,400
I didn't know that.

214
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,800
I was hoping you'd talk to him,

215
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,700
maybe make him understand
how foolish this is -

216
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,100
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa -

217
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,400
He respects you, he'll listen to you -

218
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:22,500
I can't do that, he hasn't even told
me that he's getting married yet-

219
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,000
This is killing his mother.

220
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:29,500
Okay. I'll talk to him,
but you should know that we aren't as

221
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,800
close as we were, ever since -

222
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,500
Ever since he met her.

223
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,100
She's taking over his life Dan.

224
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,500
I'll talk to him.

225
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,400
Ed, can I have a few moments?

226
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,900
It'll only take a couple minutes.

227
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,900
Okay.

228
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:06,100
How yeah feeling, Ed?
You look a little tired lately.

229
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,600
I'm fine. Mid-Terms comin' up is all.

230
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:15,500
How's everything else? Your Folks?

231
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,900
How's your mom?

232
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,300
She's fine...
you know, good days and bad days.

233
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,600
Yeah.

234
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:30,700
How about you and Asenath?
Everything all right there?

235
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,400
Did my father tell you?

236
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,800
He's just worried about you.

237
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,900
I know. But he's projecting his
feelings about Ephraim onto Asenath.

238
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:07,300
Maybe you're rushing into things. I mean,
you've only known each other for a month,

239
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,400
and now you want to get married.

240
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,300
Oh, fuck off.

241
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,200
What?

242
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:16,000
I'm so tired of your fucking meddling.

243
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,500
You've never taken a risk in your life,

244
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,400
you've never bothered to
reach for anything beyond what

245
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,700
you can touch with your own fingers,
see with your own eyes.

246
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,700
And here you are,
cautioning me about rushing into things.

247
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,200
As if you had any authority on the subject!

248
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,600
I'll thank you to keep your
nose out of my business, Upton!

249
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,400
You don't want to cross me!

250
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,800
Where am I?

251
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,700
It is very dark here. I cannot see.

252
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,300
Ephraim?

253
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:44,300
It would appear so. Why are you here?

254
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,600
I'm dreaming.

255
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:52,100
I'm dead. Your friend will be coming soon.

256
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,500
Edward? What do you mean?

257
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:58,300
He will damn his knees at
the Altar of Yog-Sothoth.

258
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,000
You cannot save him.

259
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,700
What is she doing to him?

260
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,000
Nothing.

261
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,000
I'm dead. You must leave. He's coming.

262
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,300
Do you mean Edward?

263
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,700
No.

264
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,800
Him.

265
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,500
(gunshot)

266
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,500
Honey? What's wrong?

267
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:41,000
Nothing. It's just a bad dream.

268
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,700
What?
- It's Edward. He's packing.

269
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,000
What do you think you're doing?

270
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,500
My father just called.

271
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:14,000
You can't leave now.
We're getting very close.

272
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,600
Asenath, my mother...

273
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,900
This isn't about your mother.

274
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,300
You've lost your spine, boy.

275
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,500
I just need to spend a
little time with my family.

276
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:29,100
I'll be back after my... afterwards.

277
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:36,300
Of course. What was I thinking?

278
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,700
You do what you have to do.

279
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,300
We still have plenty of time.

280
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,700
Call me if you need anything, please?

281
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,100
I will. Thank you, As.

282
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,200
Meet me in the library.

283
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,300
Perfect.

284
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,000
You gettin' in or what?

285
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,800
I forgot something. One moment, alright?

286
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,300
Meter's running.

287
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,300
Thank you, Mrs. Babson.

288
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,700
Edward. Why are you knocking?

289
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,400
(gunshots)

290
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,900
Edward? What are you doing?

291
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:33,300
(gunshots)

292
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,800
Oh, Edward.

293
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,900
You had us so worried for a moment there.

294
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,400
What? I don't...

295
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:50,400
You passed out just as the taxi was arriving.

296
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,400
Scared us all half to death!

297
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,300
Serious bit of flu, the doctor said.

298
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,100
My father called...

299
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,700
Yes, I called him after
we got you in the house,

300
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,100
he said not to worry,
they'll catch up with you again soon.

301
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,000
Right now you need to
concentrate on getting better.

302
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,543
Dale, still no leads
in the brutal double-murder...

303
00:27:44,563 --> 00:27:46,800
...that shook Arkham's residents
last week.

304
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:50,700
Today finds stunned family and friends here,
at Arkham Cemetery,

305
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:54,500
where the funeral for Clive and
Miriam Derby has just ended.

306
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,200
Hi, honey.

307
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,900
Hey. How was the funeral?

308
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,200
Very sad.

309
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,800
Well, believe it or not, he wasn't here.

310
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:22,100
I know. He hasn't been at school all
week, well... that's understandable.

311
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,400
I'm going to go in and check in on him.

312
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,500
Okay. I'll see you in a bit. Bye.

313
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,000
(knocking)

314
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,000
(knocking)

315
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,200
What do you want?

316
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,800
Uh hi. Is Edward here?
- No.

317
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,000
Uh, how about Asenath?

318
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,600
No. They're both gone.
They won't be back for quite a while.

319
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,400
I'll tell them you stopped by.

320
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,000
What's all the racket up here?

321
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:25,100
Please, Asenath, let me out.

322
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,600
No, let me out of here...

323
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Let me out of here...

324
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,200
Bitch! Dan was right about you all along!

325
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:38,900
Upton's an idiot. And you, you're a fool.

326
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:50,300
God, you disgust me.

327
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,700
Why doesn't Edward come around anymore?

328
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,300
He's very busy now.

329
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:03,300
Edward just got married, and he doesn't
have as much time as he used to.

330
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,300
Is he mad at me?

331
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,000
Of course he's not mad at you!
Why would you say that?

332
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,000
The little girl said
Edward was gonna hurt me.

333
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,300
What? What little girl?

334
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,600
The girl with the funny coat.

335
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,900
Well what girl? What's her name?

336
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:23,700
I don't know.

337
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,800
Well, you find out.

338
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:30,700
Never mind, I'm going to find out,
I'll go talk to your teacher tomorrow. Okay?

339
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:37,400
Now... you go to sleep. And no more...
no more silly talk.

340
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,400
Okay?
I love you.

341
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,400
Love you too.

342
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,600
Well you better. I'll see tomorrow, okay?

343
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,500
Okay
- Good night.

344
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,700
We're going to have to have a
talk with Richie's principal.

345
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,600
Some girl at school is
telling stories to scare him.

346
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:04,400
I mean, I know kids are kids and all that,
but we gotta nip this in the bud.

347
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,800
You know, it starts out as nothing,

348
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:12,200
he starts having nightmares, then he starts
wetting the bed, and before you know it...

349
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:16,300
he's up on the water tower with a rifle,
taking potshots at joggers.

350
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:27,500
So, do you want to talk, or...?

351
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:44,000
Jesus Christ, keep it down!
Richie's just upstairs yeah know!

352
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:55,700
Holy shit. What brought that on?

353
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,100
Did you like that?

354
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:01,200
Oh yeah. It was incredible.

355
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,400
We haven't done that since...

356
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,600
We've never done that.

357
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,500
Did you like that?

358
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,900
Well, you know...
What's the phrase again, Upton?

359
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:21,500
Oh yeah: Tirelessly mediocre.

360
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,300
What? What did you just say to me?

361
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,200
(laughter)

362
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,700
Lately though, some scholars
suggest that the Canaanites may

363
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:06,200
have confused two different moon gods,
and that Jarih is completely

364
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:12,100
different from Erah, although both
were worshipped as lunar deities.

365
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:18,400
So, for tomorrow I want chapter eight read,
and expect discussion.

366
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:23,800
And also, your papers are due on The
Esoteric Order of Dagon.

367
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,400
Jesus, Edward! Are you alright?

368
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,400
You have some forms you'll
have to fill out here, Sir.

369
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:47,300
Edward, come on let's go.

370
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,400
God Dan, I was there,
at the Pit of the Shoggoths!

371
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,700
I told her I wasn't ready,

372
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,900
I told her I didn't want to do it anymore,
but she took my body!

373
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,300
Down the six-thousand steps!
She was right there the whole time!

374
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,200
I didn't believe her, I mean, who would?

375
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,100
But it's out there, waiting...

376
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,500
Waiting for someone to wake it up...

377
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,000
Edward...

378
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,000
I took it back,
and I found myself there, and I ran.

379
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:22,200
Something chased me Dan, a Shoggoth,

380
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,700
I'm sure of it!

381
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:28,100
She's getting stronger...

382
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:36,500
I hope you'll forget my
attack back there, Upton.

383
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,600
I'm afraid my mind hasn't really
gotten over the shock of it all,

384
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:43,900
and I find myself imagining
all sorts of terrible things.

385
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,900
I've been under a tremendous
amount of stress lately,

386
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,100
And please disregard any crazy things
I may have been saying about my wife

387
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,200
or things in general.

388
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:57,600
That's what comes with
overstudying a field like mine.

389
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:03,400
Please don't blame Asenath,
she's really a very understanding woman.

390
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:13,600
I really appreciate this lift home.

391
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,500
No problem.

392
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,900
EDWARD!!!!

393
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,800
So, is Edward coming back,
after all that's happened?

394
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,300
Yeah. I don't expect him back for some time.

395
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,800
Really? Okay.

396
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:01,700
Perhaps he was disgusted by the substandard
levels of teaching in this school.

397
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,700
In this class in particular.

398
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:19,800
Maybe he wasn't comfortable
working with a rapist.

399
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,600
How's your wife, Upton?

400
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,900
What the hell is going on here?

401
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,800
You! You're behind this!

402
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,900
I don't know what you're talking about.

403
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:53,800
I'm only here to tell you Edward and
I will not be returning to class.

404
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,400
We're leaving Miskatonic.

405
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:01,200
Good-bye, Upton.

406
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,300
You shouldn't be here.

407
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,600
Asenath?

408
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,500
Yes.

409
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,900
Why are you here?

410
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,200
He put me here.
I've been here for a long time.

411
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:33,600
If you're not careful,
he'll put you here too.

412
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:38,800
Who? Edward? Why?

413
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,500
Yog-Sothoth commands him now,
and he is eager to rise again.

414
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,600
He is the gate, and the others will follow.

415
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,600
I don't know what that means.

416
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:55,400
You might be able to save your friend,
but you can't do it alone.

417
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,100
Maybe he can help you.

418
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,600
(knocking)

419
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,500
(knocking)

420
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,000
(knocking)

421
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:27,000
(knocking)
Jesus Christ.

422
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,600
Alright already!

423
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,500
Edward!

424
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,000
Can I come in?

425
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:39,300
Of course!

426
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,600
What's going on?

427
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,900
I don't know where to start.

428
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,100
I had a huge fight with Asenath.

429
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,100
She's gone for good.

430
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,700
Just packed up and headed back to Innsmouth.

431
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:00,600
Jesus, Ed... uh... I don't know what to say.

432
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:03,600
Well, how about congratulations?

433
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:06,600
She was stealing my body, Dan!

434
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,800
What are you saying?

435
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,400
At first it was kind of fun,

436
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:14,100
we would switch places and nobody
could tell the difference.

437
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,900
But then she started doing
it when I wasn't ready,

438
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:22,000
crowding me out, locking me in the
house while she went out with my body!

439
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:27,300
Please Ed, you're beginning
to sound like a tourist.

440
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,400
You can't believe what you're saying.

441
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,700
One minute I was riding in the car with you,

442
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,400
and the next I was locked in
the library at our house!

443
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:39,400
You must have ridden with
her the rest of the way home.

444
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,900
Couldn't you tell the difference?

445
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:50,400
Why... I mean, how could she be
able to do something like that?

446
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,000
It doesn't make any sense.

447
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:56,500
There are people who can do things
nobody should be able to do.

448
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,600
She belongs to a cult, Dan.

449
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:02,900
They worship a being called Yog-Sothoth.

450
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:07,900
They believe that when the stars are right
he can be summoned by one of his priests...

451
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,800
and he can be used as a gate
between the two worlds.

452
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:15,300
That's what they were trying to
do when I escaped from the Pit!

453
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:20,500
Edward, you're exhausted.
You just need a good night's sleep.

454
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:24,600
You don't believe me?

455
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:27,700
Why do they need you for all of this?

456
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:31,100
I mean why are you so
important for this summoning?

457
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,800
Because I'm starting to
understand the science!

458
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,100
Ephraim was absolutely right!

459
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,900
It's not supernatural! It's not Magic!

460
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,600
It's just a different science
rooted in a different reality.

461
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:46,500
I can't believe it took
so long to figure out!

462
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:50,600
Dan, it's all in the Pnakotic Manuscripts!
It's all right there!

463
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:54,034
And, besides, Arkham's history
has proven itself...

464
00:43:54,054 --> 00:43:57,000
...to be a focal point
for strange happenings!

465
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:02,700
Okay, enough. Let's get you to bed.

466
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:07,800
We can talk about it in the morning.

467
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,500
No way...

468
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,400
No way...

469
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:40,400
(phone rings)

470
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:43,900
(phone rings)

471
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:45,200
Hello?

472
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:46,400
<i>Dan? It's Edward.</i>

473
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,400
Hey. How are you feeling?

474
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,300
<i>Much better.
I just wanted to say thanks for letting</i>

475
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:52,900
<i>Me stay at your place last night.</i>

476
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:56,300
<i>I know I said some crazy stuff,
and I appreciate you not freaking out on me.</i>

477
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,800
Well, you've been under a lot of stress
lately, what with your parents...

478
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:05,000
<i>I know. I know. My parents... and
Asenath, you can go ahead and say it.</i>

479
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:10,000
<i>Look, she really screwed me up for awhile,
but that's all passed.</i>

480
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:14,800
<i>She won't bother me anymore, Dan.</i>
I've made sure of that.

481
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,500
Yeah. Yeah, I think I will. Maybe tomorrow.

482
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:30,300
Good. Well, take your time,
there's need to rush things.

483
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:34,600
Right. Thanks, Dan. For everything.

484
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:38,100
Come back here when you're ready.
We'll see you soon.

485
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:42,600
<i>Okay. Bye.</i>
- Bye-Bye.

486
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,000
(phone rings)

487
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:05,700
(phone rings)

488
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:09,600
You've reached the Upton residence,
please leave a message. (beep)

489
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,500
<i>Hi Dan, this is Edward.</i>

490
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:14,600
<i>I'm really not feeling up to coming in today,</i>

491
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,500
<i>Still a little punch-drunk from
everything that's happened lately.</i>

492
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:22,700
<i>I'll try to make it in
later in the week. Bye.</i>

493
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:27,800
Edward? Ugh... Damnit!

494
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,900
Edward...

495
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:11,700
Hello?

496
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:28,500
Edward?
It's Dan...

497
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:32,100
is everything alright?

498
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:46,000
Edward, are you ok?

499
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:48,300
Shut up!

500
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:51,100
Edward? What is it?

501
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:54,700
Dan! What are you doing here?

502
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:57,500
I was worried about you. I mean...

503
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:00,100
Edward, what are you doing?

504
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:04,100
God Dan, it's pulling, tugging in my brain!

505
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:06,700
She's trying to come back.

506
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:11,000
Asenath? Is she calling you?

507
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:13,900
Has she been trying to...

508
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:16,600
She's whispering things to me,

509
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:20,600
scratching at the back of my mind,
she's trying to get back in.

510
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,700
She just won't give up...

511
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,000
Look, we can have this taken care of.

512
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:28,700
We can go to the police, get a
restraining order or something... come on.

513
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:36,000
Beyond body... beyond life!
Nothing can stop it...

514
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:39,000
not even death.

515
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:40,400
It's good that you brought him.

516
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:44,500
We can sedate him,
make sure he gets a couple nights good rest.

517
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,700
I didn't know what else to do.

518
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,200
You did the right thing.

519
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:52,200
Once he's calm and lucid,
I'd like to run some tests,

520
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:55,100
see if we can't determine
what caused this situation.

521
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:59,300
From what you describe,
it sounds like simple mental exhaustion.

522
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:05,000
That's usually attributed to stress, and
it sounds like he's been under quite a bit.

523
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:15,400
Mr. Upton? Are you feeling alright?

524
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,600
I knew this man.
I went to school with him.

525
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:19,000
I knew this man.
I went to school with him.

526
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,500
Would it be alright if I spoke with him?

527
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:27,100
Mr. Upton, I don't think that's wise.
He's not the person you knew.

528
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:32,400
Please. I think he'd speak to me.

529
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:53,300
Robert?
You have a visitor.

530
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:58,200
Do you remember your friend Dan?

531
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:06,100
Yeah.
She told me you'd be coming.

532
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:10,200
Who told you, Robert?

533
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:13,600
You know who.

534
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,800
Doctor, would it be alright
if we spoke in private?

535
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,300
Is it okay if Dan talks to you?

536
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:28,800
You can say no.

537
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,200
It's fine.

538
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:34,100
Like I said, I've been expecting him.

539
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:42,000
Two minutes, Mr. Upton.
No more.

540
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,200
Thank you.

541
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:03,100
I've been dreaming about you.

542
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,700
Yeah. Me too.

543
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:13,900
It's all jumbled,
and I don't really know what's going on.

544
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:23,500
But... you need help...
your friend needs help.

545
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:28,400
Yeah, but I don't see how you
can help me from inside here.

546
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:35,900
Upton, you never believed...
that was your problem.

547
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,800
And your salvation, maybe.

548
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:46,200
Maybe if I hadn't believed,
I wouldn't be here right now.

549
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:50,100
But...

550
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:54,300
it's time to let go of all that skepticism.

551
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,800
Because...

552
00:51:56,900 --> 00:52:02,400
whether you believe it or not...
it's real.

553
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:09,400
It's not magic or sorcery.

554
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:14,300
It's just science

555
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:19,800
and it's real.

556
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:24,500
It's all...

557
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:25,800
math...

558
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:28,100
man

559
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:34,500
Is there some way to stop her?

560
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:38,100
What?

561
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:41,600
You think I just did all this for fun?

562
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:46,900
How do you think I've kept
myself safe all these years?

563
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:56,900
If she can do this,
why hasn't she tried it on me?

564
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:07,800
I don't know. Maybe you've got some
kind of natural psychic defense.

565
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:13,700
Maybe your skepticism
somehow made you immune.

566
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:18,800
Doesn't really matter, does it?

567
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:24,600
I...
- Shut up.

568
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:28,800
You only have two minutes.

569
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:35,700
There are books at the
school that can help you.

570
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:40,700
Formulae and symbols.

571
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:54,200
The Pnakotic Manuscripts,
The Book of Yog-Sothoth, De Vermis Mysteriis.

572
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:02,300
Stay away from the Necronomicon.

573
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,400
It can't help you.

574
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:13,200
Mr. Upton?

575
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:14,800
Okay.

576
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,200
Thank you.

577
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,100
Good luck.

578
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:33,700
You're going to need it.

579
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:19,300
Will you do what must be done?

580
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,800
I don't know if I can.

581
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:26,000
The formula is too complex,
I can't tell if I'm doing it right.

582
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:28,900
You're not. It's too late now, anyway.

583
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,400
But I've done what you said.

584
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:34,300
I talked to Black, he showed me what to do.

585
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:43,700
Too little, too late. I can't help you now.

586
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:03,400
I don't know how to stop her.
What am I supposed to do?

587
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:18,900
No, there's another way.
I just need to figure out the formula!

588
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:23,400
Yog-Sothoth is The Gate.

589
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:27,300
If The Gate is opened,
The Others will come through.

590
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:32,100
You must stop him from opening The Gate.

591
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:42,400
Now do you understand?

592
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:44,800
(phone rings)

593
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:48,500
(phone rings)

594
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:50,800
Hello? Edward?

595
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:55,800
No... Dan, it's Sarah. Are you alright?

596
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,400
Yeah. Uh, what's going on?

597
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,900
It's Richie. He's had a really bad dream.

598
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,500
He's pretty upset,
and he'll only talk to you.

599
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:06,900
Sure. Put him on.

600
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:08,800
Dad?

601
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:13,300
Hey champ. Can't sleep? Nightmares?

602
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,800
I dreamed you were talking to Uncle Edward,

603
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:20,600
and something really bad happened to him!

604
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:24,000
<i>Dad? Dad? Are you there?</i>

605
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:26,500
Yeah. I'm here.

606
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:30,800
Uh... That was just a nightmare.
You know that buddy.

607
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:34,500
Must be watching those
scary movies again, huh?

608
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:37,100
It didn't feel like a dream.

609
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:41,300
Shh. It's just a dream. Put your mom back on.

610
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:44,300
<i>Okay. I miss you.</i>

611
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,800
I miss you too, buddy.

612
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,200
Hey.

613
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:53,300
I know things haven't been
that great since that night,

614
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:57,100
and I just wanted to say that I'm sorry.

615
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:01,400
Anyway, um... I'll call you tomorrow.

616
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:06,900
Dan. I'm scared. I feel like something
really bad is going to happen.

617
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:12,000
Nah. Everything's fine.
You'll see, we'll get through this. Okay?

618
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:14,400
Alright.

619
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:17,900
I love you.

620
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:23,000
I love you too. Bye.

621
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,900
(phone rings)

622
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:31,200
Hello?
- <i>Hello. It's Dr. Russel at the institute.</i>

623
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:33,900
Dr. Russel! Is everything alright?

624
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,200
<i>Everything's fine.</i>

625
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:36,800
<i>In fact, I'm calling to tell you</i>

626
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:40,800
<i>That I've been talking with Edward,
and he seems to be recovering.</i>

627
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,600
<i>I'd like to keep him for
observation for a few days,</i>

628
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:46,300
<i>But if you'd like to visit him today,
you certainly may.</i>

629
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,900
That's great news. I'll be there shortly.

630
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:51,000
<i>Wonderful... Good-bye.</i>

631
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:53,100
Bye.

632
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:00,800
Too little, too late my ass.

633
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:22,900
Mr. Upton! Edward will be so pleased to
see you. He's asked for you repeatedly.

634
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:26,500
Yes. Doctor, how is Robert Black?

635
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:34,300
I'm sorry, Mr. Upton.
Robert passed away in the night in his sleep.

636
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:40,100
I'm told he went peacefully,
there was no pain.

637
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:42,700
Oh. Jesus.

638
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:00,100
Here we are.

639
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:17,800
Upton. Good of you to come!

640
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:22,517
Things were a bit rough there
for a while,

641
01:01:22,537 --> 01:01:25,300
but as you can see,
I'm feeling much better now.

642
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:28,500
These past few days have taught me much.

643
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:31,800
I'd love to discuss it
with you once I'm released.

644
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:35,000
And do say hello to Sarah and Richard for me.

645
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:42,000
I'm ready to leave now.

646
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,100
(phone rings)

647
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,700
(phone rings)

648
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,400
Hello?

649
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:41,800
(peculiar noise)

650
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:46,400
Hello?

651
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:51,200
(dial tone)

652
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:21,600
(thunder)

653
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:25,300
(dial tone)

654
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:28,300
(knock)

655
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:31,800
(light knock)

656
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:34,300
(light knock)

657
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:37,400
(light knock)

658
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:39,400
(light knock)

659
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:41,000
(light knock)

660
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:43,200
(light knock)

661
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:45,300
(light knock)
(bell)

662
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:48,300
Asenath?

663
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:54,500
What happened?

664
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:13,100
What's going on?

665
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:16,900
Do you need a doctor?

666
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:34,900
<i>Dan, By now you must realize that
everything I've told you is true,</i>

667
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:39,300
<i>And perhaps even suspect what it
took so long for me to figure out.</i>

668
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:43,900
<i>It wasn't Ephraim who died
in that cell ten years ago -</i>

669
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:46,400
<i>He had switched bodies with his daughter,</i>

670
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:50,500
<i>Ensuring he would live long enough to
see his unholy Summoning completed.</i>

671
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:54,700
<i>I lied when I said she left me.</i>

672
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:57,700
<i>I killed her.
I had to!</i>

673
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:02,400
<i>The time of the Summoning was near,
and she was becoming too powerful.</i>

674
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:06,800
<i>I was in my right body,
and she let her guard down.</i>

675
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,900
<i>I shot her.</i>

676
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,000
(gunshot)

677
01:06:13,100 --> 01:06:17,400
<i>But I could feel her trying to worm
back into my mind from beyond death,</i>

678
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:21,800
<i>And last night I found myself
trapped in her corpse.</i>

679
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:27,100
<i>I can't talk, but I can still write.
I'll get this letter to you somehow.</i>

680
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,700
<i>Go to the asylum and kill it -</i>

681
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:32,100
<i>It is not your friend anymore!</i>

682
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:37,100
<i>If you don't, he will complete
the summoning using my body.</i>

683
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,500
<i>You've been a good friend.</i>

684
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:43,600
<i>I'm sorry I dragged you into this.</i>

685
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,600
<i>I'll be at peace soon. Edward.</i>

686
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:54,700
Asenath, I...

687
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,400
Edward?

688
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,800
No. This is some kind of sick joke

689
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:44,800
Mr. Upton!

690
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:49,000
Hey. Do you think it would be alright
if I spoke with Edward for a minute.

691
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:51,600
It's a little late for visiting hours.

692
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:55,600
I know. It would only take a minute,
and it's really important.

693
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,500
Don't tell anybody,
though - you could get me in trouble!

694
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:01,200
Oh... I won't.

695
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,200
Five minutes, Mr. Upton - I mean it.

696
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:09,200
Thank you.

697
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:17,900
Can't sleep, Upton? Nightmares?

698
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:20,600
You're too late, you know.

699
01:08:21,300 --> 01:08:25,700
Your friend is dead,
and all of your amateurish preparations

700
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:29,600
could not prevent what has
been foretold for centuries.

701
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:31,800
And what is that?

702
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:34,200
The coming of Yog-Sothoth.

703
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:38,100
He is The Gate in which the Old
Ones will return to our dimension.

704
01:08:39,300 --> 01:08:41,700
I'm not going to let that happen.

705
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,600
God, Upton. You're so predictable.

706
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:56,800
As the hour draws nearer, this
body is imbued with the power of Yog-Sothoth.

707
01:08:56,900 --> 01:09:01,700
I cannot be stopped. HE cannot be stopped!

708
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:09,500
You're a weak-minded fool, Upton.
You always were.

709
01:09:12,300 --> 01:09:15,800
Surprised, Upton? Of course you are.

710
01:09:15,900 --> 01:09:20,600
Your tiny mind never could comprehend
the power of the Old Ones.

711
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:55,000
But now I see that you have
the look of a true believer,

712
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:59,400
no longer my Doubting Thomas - Upton.

713
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:06,400
Upton, let go,
this world has no place for you.

714
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:18,200
No! What have you done?

715
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:39,100
Goodbye, Ephraim.
(gunshots)

716
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:06,700
Look, I know the story is unbelievable.

717
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:08,603
If you just dig a little deeper,

718
01:11:08,623 --> 01:11:11,300
I'm sure that you'll find things
that point to the truth.

719
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:17,000
Oh we have... dug a little deeper, Mr. Upton.

720
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:22,300
The dead body we found in your
house is indeed Asenath Waite.

721
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,699
And she was shot and killed...

722
01:11:24,719 --> 01:11:28,400
...with the same unregistered gun
you used on your friend Edward.

723
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:30,100
Interestingly enough,

724
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:34,000
that same gun was used on
Edward's parents last month.

725
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:39,000
Look, Upton. We know you've
been having problems lately.

726
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:42,300
Your wife has recently
moved out of the house.

727
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:45,500
There was a blow up at several
students in the classroom.

728
01:11:46,100 --> 01:11:48,800
All the writing on the
windows in your home...

729
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:53,200
And your star student suddenly gets
married and leaves school.

730
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:57,200
Am I detecting a little
jealousy, Upton... hmm?

731
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:01,000
So you decide to kill everybody
that's keeping him away from you?

732
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:03,300
Is that what happened?

733
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:05,700
Jesus.

734
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Get him out of here.

735
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,400
Richie!

736
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:17,800
Daddy
- Richard

737
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:21,000
Little buddy, everything's going to be fine.

738
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:24,100
Daddy, what's going to happen to you?
What are they going to do?

739
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:26,900
No, no, everything's gonna be fine.

740
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,900
I'm going to be fine.

741
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:32,100
As soon as we get this all straightened out,
I'll be home soon.

742
01:12:32,300 --> 01:12:36,600
You really think after you killed
Edward and his parents and his wife

743
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:40,000
they're going to let you walk free?

744
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:44,400
Ah well, you never really
were that smart, Upton.

745
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:47,000
In fact, you've always been just...

746
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:50,200
tirelessly mediocre.

747
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:52,700
Get out of my son, you bastard.

748
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,300
Get out of my son, Ephraim!

749
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:58,800
Get out of my son, you son of a bitch!!!

750
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:01,800
NO!!!! NO!!
