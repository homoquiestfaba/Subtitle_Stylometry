1
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,111
What the fuck is that guy doing?

2
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,813
I don't know.

3
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:14,921
Ready?

4
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,725
- Ready.
- Ready.

5
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,781
Fuck!

6
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,149
Hey!

7
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,118
Calm down!

8
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:00,166
No!

9
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:02,801
You always start on the left,

10
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,504
never on the right!

11
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:10,870
Good, good now do the pants with the shears.

12
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:27,587
Always on the left, never on the right!

13
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,865
Now I want you to do it slower.

14
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:42,934
I want you to make me fuckin' hard!

15
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:45,004
That's good, that's good.

16
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:53,813
Make me hard.

17
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:05,024
Good, good.

18
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:13,499
I said slower!

19
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:35,221
That's good, that's good!

20
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:01,347
Move.

21
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:51,196
No, no, leave the underwear.

22
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,532
Sexier that way.

23
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:06,145
Want you to start at the groin and move down.

24
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:14,185
Shit, I'm out of film.

25
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:16,289
Second Unit, how are you?

26
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:20,659
I've got 18 left.

27
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,428
Cut!

28
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,245
Hey, you never start on the right!

29
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,348
Always start on the left!

30
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:20,753
Now slower, slower.

31
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:29,995
Oh yeah.

32
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:31,731
Oh, gettin' hard now.

33
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:37,236
Slower.

34
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:45,578
Oh yeah, hard but not trippin'.

35
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:04,397
Sorry, didn't mean to leave it like that.

36
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:16,362
Shh.

37
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:18,931
You're gonna wake your mother.

38
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:24,603
Going to help you.

39
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,306
This is for your own good.

40
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:43,922
It's okay, you're not a Christian.

41
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:46,090
You're just a animal who doesn't believe.

42
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:48,227
Let's give her the special medicine.

43
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:58,536
Shit, I got 20 feed left.

44
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:00,372
We can do this.

45
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:15,721
All right, give her some more

46
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:17,423
of that special sauce.

47
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:47,518
Hey, we should get

48
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,888
some footage of number two.

49
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:51,056
Now make sure you get

50
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:52,625
that crucifix in the shot.

51
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:56,689
What!

52
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:57,789
- No!
- Shh!

53
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:02,528
No!

54
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:14,072
She's not gonna give us anymore problems.

55
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:16,442
Now let's get her on the special sauce.

56
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,278
I just rolled out.

57
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:48,307
It's ready.

58
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:50,942
It's good to have you here, Second Unit.

59
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,012
We would have lost some footage without you.

60
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:56,281
Cut to you, Third Unit.

61
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:01,887
And thank you too, for your participation.

62
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,729
Now look, Units, just as we rehearsed.

63
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:14,399
Remember, we be immobile now.

64
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,734
But they need to understand what and why

65
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:18,836
this is happening to them.

66
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:19,872
They need to know.

67
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:24,109
Cut to you, Third Unit.

68
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:43,394
Let me congratulate you,

69
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:44,930
in being picked for this honor.

70
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:48,100
You have been chosen out of many.

71
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:52,504
Your lives are going to be given

72
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:55,007
to those down below.

73
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,811
Your sacrifice will not be in vain.

74
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:02,648
And if you're wondering why neither of you can move,

75
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:08,453
you've been injected with a no-muscular blocking agent.

76
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:10,622
In fact, you won't need 'em, to be precise.

77
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:14,059
And that strange liquid I had you swallow,

78
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:18,696
1,500 micrograms of LSD

79
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:20,566
has been introduced into your system.

80
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:28,474
Now, you are to be systematically tortured to death

81
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,910
while being filmed for our benefactors.

82
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,021
You're with Christ?

83
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,258
You're the last one to go.

84
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:48,427
Your God picked you!

85
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:50,962
Knew you would be here.

86
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,698
I'll give this back to you

87
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:55,534
when the time is needed.

88
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,109
Cut!

89
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:50,648
look at you.

90
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:53,484
Look at you, you fuckin' dirty, rotten,

91
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:56,355
fuckin' disgusted animal, fuck you.

92
00:20:58,957 --> 00:20:59,758
Stop!

93
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:02,527
Put the tourniquet on.

94
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:05,664
She needs to live as long as she can.

95
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:08,900
Start with the wrist first.

96
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:18,336
I know.

97
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,504
You know what you were Christian,

98
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:21,340
don't you?

99
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,266
Roll out!

100
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:53,605
Rolling!

101
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:34,745
Oh, that's much better.

102
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,681
I think she likes that.

103
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,257
No, put that on her.

104
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:48,693
Put it on her chest.

105
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:55,733
No, no, no, not the animal.

106
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:57,602
Don't play with the animal.

107
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:22,727
All right, now tie the other leg off.

108
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,687
Yeah.

109
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:27,425
Cuttin' you up real nice, you fuckin' animal.

110
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:28,720
I'm out of film.

111
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:03,841
Shit, you just sawed through

112
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:06,344
the thickest part of the bone!

113
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:45,809
Fuck this.

114
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:46,611
Goin' big.

115
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:02,026
That shit ain't gonna work.

116
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:15,906
Bone's too thick.

117
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:16,841
Tie higher.

118
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:12,664
I'm out!

119
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:05,976
I can't fucking do this anymore.

120
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:07,644
This is fuckin' insane!

121
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:08,645
I can't handle this!

122
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:10,147
I just, wow!

123
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:12,083
Hey, shut the fuck up!

124
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:17,988
Listen, you're doin' this for a reason, all right?

125
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:20,724
You know that we have your kids.

126
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,693
You know that we have your children.

127
00:34:23,694 --> 00:34:25,629
And what happens to them depends

128
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:28,065
on your performance tonight.

129
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:31,002
So don't fuck this up, okay?

130
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:33,137
Smile, VHS.

131
00:34:34,672 --> 00:34:36,641
Our producers are watching.

132
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:53,084
Cut to you, VHS.

133
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,374
Okay stop.

134
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:20,278
That's the limit.

135
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,788
Roll out.

136
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,391
You're now being tested.

137
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:10,761
We have less than five minutes to wrap this up.

138
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:29,532
Okay, that's enough entertaining.

139
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,868
Thanks for being such a wonderful participant

140
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:36,874
for us tonight.

141
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,955
All right, come on VHS.

142
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:54,257
This is your moment to shine.

143
00:39:54,258 --> 00:39:56,793
Get in here and don't fuck this up.

144
00:39:56,794 --> 00:39:59,096
We're gonna bleed this flower out.

145
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,214
You're doin' a good job.

146
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:19,750
I had to change my underwear.

147
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:11,328
Get the razor.

148
00:47:53,003 --> 00:47:54,504
That's good, good.

149
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,049
Nice.

150
00:51:37,794 --> 00:51:39,462
Sometimes we get lucky.

151
00:51:39,463 --> 00:51:41,831
The script goes out the window.

152
00:51:41,832 --> 00:51:43,900
And what we have is luck.

153
00:55:11,341 --> 00:55:12,508
Good.

154
00:55:12,509 --> 00:55:13,510
You did good.

155
00:59:31,768 --> 00:59:33,870
Roll out!

156
00:59:46,182 --> 00:59:47,016
Rolling!

157
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:59,502
All right, let's take her out.

158
01:05:18,447 --> 01:05:20,749
Welcome to Hollywood, Erika!

159
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:23,752
You're a fucking star now.

160
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:25,021
Let's everybody give her a round of applause.

161
01:05:45,541 --> 01:05:47,842
All right!

162
01:05:47,843 --> 01:05:48,678
Oh yeah!

163
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:51,914
Yeah, yeah!

164
01:05:53,149 --> 01:05:54,817
Yeah, yeah, oh yeah,

165
01:05:56,452 --> 01:06:00,423
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

166
01:07:35,317 --> 01:07:36,451
Yep, you got it?

167
01:07:36,452 --> 01:07:37,719
You got all the rest of it?

168
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:38,720
You got it?

169
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:39,655
- Yeah.
- You think it'll work?

170
01:07:39,656 --> 01:07:40,855
- Yeah?
- I got it.

171
01:07:40,856 --> 01:07:42,090
All right, yes, I know what

172
01:07:42,091 --> 01:07:43,625
the producers want, got it.

173
01:07:43,626 --> 01:07:45,093
I know what they want.

174
01:07:45,094 --> 01:07:47,730
Jesus Christ, this time are the girls good lookin'?

175
01:07:48,697 --> 01:07:50,398
Eh.

176
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:51,533
Eh, so-so?

177
01:07:51,534 --> 01:07:52,700
- Eh, so-so.
- So-so,

178
01:07:52,701 --> 01:07:55,304
that's all they are?

179
01:07:56,138 --> 01:07:57,339
All right, tell ya, man.

180
01:07:58,474 --> 01:08:01,043
I tell you what, you gotta ram that guy, man.

181
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:03,645
I don't like that guy.

182
01:08:03,646 --> 01:08:05,080
I think he's gonna fuck everything up.

183
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:09,184
I hate working with that big, bald Eight.

184
01:08:09,185 --> 01:08:11,586
He doesn't listen to direction.

185
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:14,323
He doesn't understand his right from his left.

186
01:08:15,491 --> 01:08:17,526
Well you tell that to the boss.

187
01:08:19,628 --> 01:08:20,995
I ain't havin' it.

188
01:08:20,996 --> 01:08:22,564
