Hello, Maggie.

It's nice to meet you.

Yes, he did.Is it all right?

unload the car.

Maggie's not real?

I do.

from a large family?

I'm the eldest. Thanks.

And you raised the others?

My mum couldn't, you see.

248
00:12:28,269 --> 00:12:29,923
And my dad passed
away years ago.

How old were you when
your mom got sick?

00:12:40,716 --> 00:12:42,500
I was about 10.

254
00:12:42,544 --> 00:12:44,807
And you stayed until
the youngest could take
care of themselves?

255
00:12:46,156 --> 00:12:47,592
That's very unselfish.

256
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,421

I was unselfish or
anything that grand.

to work at home so much

and when you come back,
you'll be all better?

1245
01:05:33,277 --> 01:05:35,801
Good. It'll be
okay, honey.

1246
01:05:35,844 --> 01:05:37,846
No. Tim, I want to come.

1247
01:05:37,890 --> 01:05:40,023
Well, two to one, outvoted.

1248
01:05:46,638 --> 01:05:48,683
I understand you
have stomach pain.

1249
01:05:48,727 --> 01:05:49,946
I... Do, yes.

1250
01:05:49,989 --> 01:05:50,947
Where?

1251
01:05:51,730 --> 01:05:52,992
Uh...

1252
01:05:53,036 --> 01:05:54,820
Here.

1253
01:05:54,863 --> 01:05:56,300
Could you remove
your shirt, please?

1254
01:06:07,093 --> 01:06:10,183
Well, I had this fever
just 24 hours ago

1255
01:06:10,227 --> 01:06:13,012
and, and I didn't
call my doctor.

1256
01:06:13,056 --> 01:06:15,928
Now the fever's gone,
but this pain in my stomach

1257
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:18,017
I just thought
it might be related.

1258
01:06:18,061 --> 01:06:19,497
DOCTOR: Really?

1259
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:22,587
Hmm...

1260
01:06:22,630 --> 01:06:25,677
Well, that's pretty
interesting, Mr. Beeman
but honestly, you seem fine.

1261
01:06:26,721 --> 01:06:28,158
I mean, I believe you...

1262
01:06:28,201 --> 01:06:29,986
Uh-huh.

1263
01:06:30,029 --> 01:06:31,422
If your stomach hurts
your stomach hurts.

1264
01:06:31,465 --> 01:06:32,423
Right.

1265
01:06:34,642 --> 01:06:37,471
Then again, it could
all be in your mind.

1266
01:06:38,690 --> 01:06:39,952
Really?

1267
01:06:41,388 --> 01:06:44,522
Well...
Hope you feel better.

1268
01:06:44,565 --> 01:06:46,263
Thanks. I'm really
glad I came.

1269
01:06:47,873 --> 01:06:50,223
Uh, Doctor, excuse me.Yes?

1270
01:06:50,267 --> 01:06:52,704
Um, could I have, uh,
one of those lollipops?

1271
01:06:54,662 --> 01:06:56,795
Uh... Yeah.

1272
01:06:56,838 --> 01:06:58,362
Sure, I guess so.

1273
01:06:59,406 --> 01:07:00,886
I have a daughter out front.

1274
01:07:01,669 --> 01:07:02,888
Of course.

1275
01:07:04,890 --> 01:07:05,891
Thanks.

1276
01:07:07,849 --> 01:07:10,461
TIM: Nice doctor.
It's nothing worry about.

1277
01:07:10,504 --> 01:07:12,158
Oh, Maggie, you look better.

1278
01:07:12,202 --> 01:07:13,420
Was there a prescription?

1279
01:07:13,464 --> 01:07:16,902
The usual. Aspirin, fluids.

1280
01:07:16,945 --> 01:07:19,426
Everything's going
to be okay. Come on.

1281
01:07:50,849 --> 01:07:52,807
Tim?[GASPS]

1282
01:07:52,851 --> 01:07:54,244
I'm sorry.

1283
01:07:54,287 --> 01:07:55,375
You startled me,
that's all.

1284
01:07:56,420 --> 01:07:57,725
Are you okay?

1285
01:07:59,553 --> 01:08:01,164
I remember the day
I first saw you.

1286
01:08:02,643 --> 01:08:03,775
Oh, God.

1287
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:10,825
I'd do anything for you.

1288
01:08:13,306 --> 01:08:16,483
Tim. You're shaking.

1289
01:08:16,527 --> 01:08:18,485
Anything, Annie.

1290
01:08:18,529 --> 01:08:20,139
Are you worried
about Maggie?

1291
01:08:20,183 --> 01:08:21,749
No. No, it's just...
[EXHALES]

1292
01:08:23,011 --> 01:08:24,578
I don't know
how to express it.

1293
01:08:27,451 --> 01:08:28,800
I want...

1294
01:08:28,843 --> 01:08:31,063
I want to take care of you.

1295
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:33,152
I want to tell you
how much I love you.

1296
01:08:34,762 --> 01:08:36,329
I love our family.

1297
01:09:06,359 --> 01:09:07,969
DOC: Hey, Gilly.

1298
01:09:08,013 --> 01:09:08,970
Can I come in?

1299
01:09:09,014 --> 01:09:10,146
Sure.

1300
01:09:17,022 --> 01:09:19,677
What's the matter?

1301
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:23,376
Oh, it's... Our going
to see that woman at
Children's Services today.

1302
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:25,117
I guess I'm just frightened.

1303
01:09:27,598 --> 01:09:29,643
Does your mother know,
do you think?

1304
01:09:30,340 --> 01:09:31,950
No. She doesn't.

1305
01:09:31,993 --> 01:09:32,864
I'd know.

1306
01:09:34,648 --> 01:09:37,303
God, this is just so awful.

1307
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:41,525
Come on, there's
nothing to worry about.

1308
01:09:41,568 --> 01:09:42,961
You're going to be great.

1309
01:09:43,004 --> 01:09:44,092
You're so sure.

1310
01:09:44,876 --> 01:09:45,877
Mostly.

1311
01:09:46,791 --> 01:09:48,009
I hope you're right.

1312
01:09:50,055 --> 01:09:52,231
Well, like Dad said

1313
01:09:52,275 --> 01:09:54,451
if anything does happen
we just run away.

1314
01:09:54,494 --> 01:09:55,539
Run away?

1315
01:09:56,366 --> 01:09:57,758
He said that?

1316
01:09:57,802 --> 01:09:59,325
Yeah.

1317
01:09:59,369 --> 01:10:01,153
He said we'd run away
to the South Pacific.

1318
01:10:03,329 --> 01:10:05,113
[SOBBING] I don't
want to run away.

1319
01:10:05,157 --> 01:10:06,332
Sweetheart.

1320
01:10:06,376 --> 01:10:08,987
[SOBBING]Shh...

1321
01:10:11,859 --> 01:10:13,034
[SOBBING]
I don't want to...

1322
01:10:13,078 --> 01:10:14,906
Shh... Oh, Doc.

1323
01:10:16,473 --> 01:10:18,562
Everything's going
to be fine, I promise.

1324
01:10:28,136 --> 01:10:29,790
LEE: Mr. Beeman,
you may come in now.

1325
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:42,934
This is Mr. Beeman.

1326
01:10:42,977 --> 01:10:45,850
Mr. Beeman, this is
Mrs. Carperhorn
and Mr. Schmidlen.

1327
01:11:02,475 --> 01:11:05,261
I have a lawsuit in here.

1328
01:11:05,304 --> 01:11:07,263
You invade my home
with armed policemen

1329
01:11:07,306 --> 01:11:09,961
threaten me with
insubstantial evidence,

1330
01:11:10,004 --> 01:11:12,877
talk to my children alone.
About what, I don't know.

1331
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:15,183
Then send a letter threatening
to take my children away

1332
01:11:15,227 --> 01:11:17,621
if I don't appear today
for this meeting.

1333
01:11:17,664 --> 01:11:22,452
This isn't even a courtroom
and I could lose my family?

1334
01:11:22,495 --> 01:11:26,194
I hope you've prepared
well because I don't
intend to stay here long.

1335
01:11:26,238 --> 01:11:29,676
I'm sorry you feel
that way, Mr. Beeman
but, where's your wife?

1336
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:31,504
Her presence was requested.

1337
01:11:31,548 --> 01:11:33,201
My wife is at home, sick.

1338
01:11:34,768 --> 01:11:37,336
Your wife is the crux
of this thing, Mr. Beeman.

1339
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:41,035
The allegation is
that she believes she
has a nonexistent child

1340
01:11:41,079 --> 01:11:42,907
and that you support
her in this fantasy.

1341
01:11:43,777 --> 01:11:46,040
That's ludicrous.

1342
01:11:46,084 --> 01:11:47,825
Where is your wife?I just told you.

1343
01:11:50,741 --> 01:11:52,308
What about your son?
We want to talk to him.

1344
01:11:53,439 --> 01:11:54,658
I brought my daughter.

1345
01:11:56,573 --> 01:11:58,139
It kills me that she has
to go through this again

1346
01:11:58,183 --> 01:11:59,880
and I'm allowing it,
but that's it.

1347
01:12:01,273 --> 01:12:02,405
You've got our nanny.

1348
01:12:02,448 --> 01:12:04,102
You can see her alone, too.

1349
01:12:04,145 --> 01:12:05,843
She's with us
all day, every day.

1350
01:12:05,886 --> 01:12:08,280
Ask her whatever you like.

1351
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:11,501
And you can talk to my
daughter. Which I hate!

1352
01:12:11,544 --> 01:12:15,200
But you are not
talking to my son.

1353
01:12:15,243 --> 01:12:18,421
He's in school.
My wife is sick.

1354
01:12:18,464 --> 01:12:20,858
Are we clear on this?
Because if we aren't

1355
01:12:20,901 --> 01:12:24,296
and you come back into my life
after today, believe me...

1356
01:12:25,950 --> 01:12:26,864
You don't know
what trouble is.

1357
01:12:31,390 --> 01:12:33,784
Anything else?

1358
01:12:33,827 --> 01:12:35,786
We all understand
your attitude.

1359
01:12:35,829 --> 01:12:37,004
We'll talk to your nanny now.

1360
01:12:43,446 --> 01:12:45,752
LEE: Now, Gillian, we
know between ourselves,

1361
01:12:45,796 --> 01:12:48,146
that you're the one that
started these allegations.

1362
01:12:48,189 --> 01:12:50,235
No, I didn't.

1363
01:12:50,278 --> 01:12:52,237
Excuse me?

1364
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:54,718
Well, I, I mean I did come
to see you, that's true,

1365
01:12:54,761 --> 01:12:57,285
because there was a nanny,

1366
01:12:57,329 --> 01:12:58,678
a friend of mine
from the playground

1367
01:12:58,722 --> 01:13:01,072
and she had a problem...

1368
01:13:01,115 --> 01:13:02,639
She's Irish, actually...

1369
01:13:02,682 --> 01:13:03,814
And she was a
little frightened.

1370
01:13:03,857 --> 01:13:05,337
So I, I said I would come here

1371
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:07,948
and try and find out
some information for her.

1372
01:13:07,992 --> 01:13:12,475
So, I did explain to you
or at least I, I started to

1373
01:13:12,518 --> 01:13:14,433
a situation that she was
dealing with in her home

1374
01:13:14,477 --> 01:13:16,827
but it was obvious
you couldn't help.

1375
01:13:16,870 --> 01:13:18,524
So I left.

1376
01:13:18,568 --> 01:13:23,616
And where this nonsense
comes from, I don't know.

1377
01:13:23,660 --> 01:13:25,749
That's not true
and you know it.

1378
01:13:26,532 --> 01:13:29,056
What's not true?

1379
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:31,537
You told me a story of
a seriously disturbed woman.

1380
01:13:31,581 --> 01:13:33,278
A mother of two small children

1381
01:13:33,321 --> 01:13:35,193
who believes that she has
a third invisible child.

1382
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:40,416
Do you honestly deny that?

1383
01:13:42,287 --> 01:13:44,463
That's the oddest thing
I've ever heard

1384
01:13:44,507 --> 01:13:46,596
and, yes, I deny it.

1385
01:13:54,691 --> 01:13:56,214
How are you, Rebecca?

1386
01:13:56,257 --> 01:13:57,694
Fine, thank you.
Why am I here?

1387
01:13:58,825 --> 01:14:00,653
Some children need protecting.

1388
01:14:00,697 --> 01:14:02,394
That's why we're here.

1389
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:05,441
So, don't be afraid to
say anything you want.

1390
01:14:05,484 --> 01:14:06,920
We're on your side.

1391
01:14:06,964 --> 01:14:07,965
Uh-huh.

1392
01:14:10,054 --> 01:14:12,273
Now, this thing that we
talked about before, um,

1393
01:14:12,317 --> 01:14:14,101
your invisible sister...

1394
01:14:14,145 --> 01:14:15,538
Invisible sister?

1395
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:19,498
You have an invisible sister.

1396
01:14:19,542 --> 01:14:22,066
My brother has an
imaginary friend or two.

1397
01:14:22,109 --> 01:14:23,850
We call one Maggie.
Is that what you mean?

1398
01:14:25,591 --> 01:14:29,203
Actually, Maggie was my
invisible friend before
she was his.

1399
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:30,553
It was kind of like
the tooth fairy.

1400
01:14:30,596 --> 01:14:32,468
You grow out of it.

1401
01:14:32,511 --> 01:14:34,992
Or, do you still believe
in the Tooth Fairy?

1402
01:14:36,210 --> 01:14:37,603
No.

1403
01:14:37,647 --> 01:14:39,257
DOC: Me, neither.

1404
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:41,389
So anyway, I grew
out of Maggie.

1405
01:14:41,433 --> 01:14:42,913
It was fun.

1406
01:14:42,956 --> 01:14:45,306
But Sam, he liked her.

1407
01:14:45,350 --> 01:14:48,222
So, now Sam's got
Maggie for a while.

1408
01:14:48,266 --> 01:14:50,877
You see, Sam
believes in Santa Claus,

1409
01:14:50,921 --> 01:14:53,489
the Easter Bunny, the
Tooth Fairy, and Maggie.

1410
01:14:54,838 --> 01:14:56,535
You think I should tell him

1411
01:14:56,579 --> 01:14:58,015
about Santa Claus
and everything.

1412
01:14:58,058 --> 01:14:59,233
Is that why I'm here?

1413
01:14:59,277 --> 01:15:01,322
No.

1414
01:15:01,366 --> 01:15:02,759
We're trying to determine

1415
01:15:02,802 --> 01:15:04,804
if you and your brother
are in a safe environment.

1416
01:15:06,066 --> 01:15:07,285
