1
00:00:25,237 --> 00:00:27,000
Come to Los Angeles.

2
00:00:27,406 --> 00:00:29,203
The sun shines bright.

3
00:00:29,408 --> 00:00:31,535
The beaches are wide and inviting.

4
00:00:31,743 --> 00:00:35,577
And the orange groves
stretch as far as the eye can see.

5
00:00:36,381 --> 00:00:39,714
There are jobs aplenty. Land is cheap.

6
00:00:39,918 --> 00:00:42,250
Every workingman can have his own house.

7
00:00:42,454 --> 00:00:46,823
And inside every house,
a happy all-American family.

8
00:00:47,225 --> 00:00:49,455
You can have all this.
And who knows?

9
00:00:50,295 --> 00:00:52,263
You could even be discovered...

10
00:00:52,464 --> 00:00:55,729
...become a movie star,
or at least see one.

11
00:00:56,168 --> 00:00:58,398
Life is good in Los Angeles.

12
00:00:58,737 --> 00:01:01,399
lt's paradise on earth.

13
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:05,301
That's what they tell you, anyway.

14
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,410
Because they're selling an image.

15
00:01:07,613 --> 00:01:11,208
They're selling it through movies,
radio and television.

16
00:01:11,416 --> 00:01:15,352
ln the hit show, Badge of Honor,
the L.A. cops walk on water...

17
00:01:15,554 --> 00:01:17,454
...as they keep the city
clean of crooks.

18
00:01:19,024 --> 00:01:21,492
You'd think this place
was the Garden of Eden.

19
00:01:21,693 --> 00:01:23,524
But there's trouble in paradise...

20
00:01:24,162 --> 00:01:28,622
...and his name is Meyer Harris Cohen,
Mickey C, to his fans.

21
00:01:28,967 --> 00:01:31,527
Local L.A. color to the nth degree.

22
00:01:32,037 --> 00:01:33,971
And his number one bodyguard...

23
00:01:34,206 --> 00:01:35,969
...Johnny Stompanato.

24
00:01:36,174 --> 00:01:38,972
Mickey C's the head
of organized crime in these parts.

25
00:01:39,244 --> 00:01:42,509
He runs dope, rackets and prostitution.

26
00:01:42,814 --> 00:01:44,475
He kills a dozen people a year.

27
00:01:45,017 --> 00:01:47,645
And the dapper little gent
does it in style.

28
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,982
And every time his picture's
on the front page...

29
00:01:51,456 --> 00:01:54,220
...it's a black eye
for the image of Los Angeles.

30
00:01:54,593 --> 00:01:57,118
Because how can organized crime exist...

31
00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:00,457
...in the city with the best
police force in the world?

32
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,266
Something has to be done.

33
00:02:02,501 --> 00:02:05,561
But nothing too original,
because, hey, this is Hollywood.

34
00:02:05,771 --> 00:02:08,865
What worked for Al Capone
would work for the Mickster.

35
00:02:09,074 --> 00:02:10,803
Mr. Cohen, you're under arrest.

36
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:13,341
Nonpayment of federal income tax.

37
00:02:13,679 --> 00:02:15,271
But all is not well.

38
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,573
Sending Mickey up has created a vacuum.

39
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:19,544
And it's only a matter of time...

40
00:02:19,751 --> 00:02:23,346
...before someone
with balls of brass tries to fill it.

41
00:02:23,755 --> 00:02:26,246
''Remember, dear readers...

42
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:28,751
...you heard it here first...

43
00:02:29,695 --> 00:02:31,492
...off the record...

44
00:02:32,164 --> 00:02:33,927
...on the q.t...

45
00:02:34,433 --> 00:02:35,900
...and very...

46
00:02:36,301 --> 00:02:38,030
...Hush-Hush.''

47
00:02:56,388 --> 00:02:58,413
You're like Santa Claus with that list.

48
00:02:58,623 --> 00:03:00,955
Except everyone on it's been naughty.

49
00:03:02,794 --> 00:03:04,819
Guy's been out of Q two weeks.

50
00:03:05,997 --> 00:03:07,055
Leave it for later.

51
00:03:07,265 --> 00:03:10,393
We've got to pick up the booze
and get it to the station.

52
00:03:12,904 --> 00:03:14,599
Hollywood, this is 6-Adam-7.

53
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,808
Have Central send a prowler
to 4216 Evergreen.

54
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:21,877
Parole violation:
assault arising from a family dispute.

55
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,775
We won't be here.
They'll see him.

56
00:03:33,492 --> 00:03:34,618
Quit whining!

57
00:03:34,826 --> 00:03:37,056
Quit whining all the time!
lt makes me sick!

58
00:03:37,262 --> 00:03:38,422
Shut up!

59
00:03:53,678 --> 00:03:54,975
Who the hell are you?

60
00:03:55,347 --> 00:03:57,338
The ghost of Christmas past.

61
00:03:58,183 --> 00:03:59,741
Dance with a man for a change?

62
00:03:59,951 --> 00:04:01,475
What are you, a smart ass?

63
00:04:15,066 --> 00:04:16,931
Youll be out in a year and a half.

64
00:04:17,135 --> 00:04:19,433
l'll get cozy with your parole officer.

65
00:04:19,638 --> 00:04:23,699
You touch her again, l'll have you
violated on a kiddie raper beef.

66
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:27,972
You know what they do
to kiddie rapers in Quentin.

67
00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:39,016
You have someplace you can go?

68
00:04:40,492 --> 00:04:42,221
Go get yourself fixed up.

69
00:04:47,232 --> 00:04:48,392
Merry Christmas.

70
00:04:49,067 --> 00:04:51,501
-Merry Christmas, ma'am.
-Let's go, Bud.

71
00:04:51,736 --> 00:04:53,033
The guys'll be waiting.

72
00:04:57,576 --> 00:04:59,669
What do you do on Badge of Honor?

73
00:04:59,878 --> 00:05:02,506
l'm the technical advisor.

74
00:05:02,714 --> 00:05:06,081
l teach Brett Chase
how to walk and talk like a cop.

75
00:05:06,585 --> 00:05:08,883
Brett Chase doesn't
walk and talk like you.

76
00:05:09,087 --> 00:05:11,351
That's because he's
the television version.

77
00:05:11,756 --> 00:05:14,054
America isn't ready for the real me.

78
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:17,023
ls it true you're the one
who arrested Bob Mitchum?

79
00:05:17,863 --> 00:05:19,626
Badge of Honor guys pretend.

80
00:05:19,831 --> 00:05:22,299
But being the real thing
must be a thrill.

81
00:05:22,534 --> 00:05:26,732
Why don't we go someplace quiet?
l'll give you the lowdown on Mitchum.

82
00:05:26,938 --> 00:05:29,338
Big V. Jack Vincennes.

83
00:05:29,674 --> 00:05:31,505
-May l have this dance?
-Of course.

84
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,974
This is Sid Hudgens
with Hush-Hush magazine.

85
00:05:34,212 --> 00:05:36,646
-Hello, Karen.
-Hello yourself.

86
00:05:38,283 --> 00:05:39,341
What's that about?

87
00:05:39,551 --> 00:05:43,112
We did a piece, ''lngenue Dikes in
Hollywood.'' Her name got mentioned.

88
00:05:44,055 --> 00:05:44,953
Jackie-boy...

89
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:48,052
...a friend just sold some reefer
to Matt Reynolds.

90
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:51,354
He's tripping the light fantastic
with Tammy Jordan.

91
00:05:52,797 --> 00:05:54,788
Sorry, l lost you for a second, Sid.

92
00:05:55,033 --> 00:05:59,436
Contract players, Metro. You pinch
them, l do a nice feature next issue.

93
00:05:59,638 --> 00:06:02,072
-Plus the usual $50 cash.
-No, l need another $50.

94
00:06:02,274 --> 00:06:05,710
Two $20's for two patrolmen, a dime for
the Hollywood Station watch commander.

95
00:06:05,911 --> 00:06:07,173
Jackie, it's Christmas.

96
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,777
No, it's not.

97
00:06:09,981 --> 00:06:12,142
lt's felony possession of marijuana.

98
00:06:13,585 --> 00:06:17,112
Actually, it's circulation 36,000
and climbing.

99
00:06:17,322 --> 00:06:20,257
There's no telling where this will go.
Radio, television.

100
00:06:20,659 --> 00:06:24,390
Once you whet the public's appetite
for the truth, the sky's the limit.

101
00:06:29,501 --> 00:06:32,493
Sergeant Ed Exley,
son of the legendary Preston Exley.

102
00:06:32,771 --> 00:06:34,363
Must be a hard act to follow.

103
00:06:36,007 --> 00:06:39,170
Why not make a mark somewhere else?
Why become a cop, Ed?

104
00:06:39,611 --> 00:06:41,408
l like to help people.

105
00:06:41,613 --> 00:06:44,241
We heard 2 officers
were assaulted this evening.

106
00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:47,213
-What do you think about that?
-Goes with the job.

107
00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:49,353
l took the report.
Luckily, they're okay.

108
00:06:49,554 --> 00:06:51,488
Aren't you young
to be watch commander?

109
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:52,679
lt's only tonight.

110
00:06:53,124 --> 00:06:55,649
The married men have Christmas Eve off.

111
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,760
That's a good lead for the story.

112
00:06:57,963 --> 00:06:59,521
Merry Christmas, Captain.

113
00:07:00,031 --> 00:07:02,625
-Captain Smith.
-Drop the formalities, Bobby.

114
00:07:02,801 --> 00:07:06,532
-lt's Christmas Eve, call me Dudley.
-l came up with a title for the story.

115
00:07:06,705 --> 00:07:09,538
l'm calling it
''Silent Night with the LAPD.''

116
00:07:09,808 --> 00:07:11,241
That's grand.

117
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:14,144
Now remember, Bobby, that's ''Smith.''

118
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:15,175
With an ''S.''

119
00:07:18,049 --> 00:07:19,983
Thank you, gentlemen.
Merry Christmas.

120
00:07:20,485 --> 00:07:21,543
Hold on there, lads.

121
00:07:24,823 --> 00:07:26,154
Merry Christmas.

122
00:07:28,927 --> 00:07:31,657
l saw the test results
on the lieutenant's exam.

123
00:07:31,896 --> 00:07:33,625
First out of 23.

124
00:07:34,065 --> 00:07:35,123
What'll it be, then?

125
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,699
Patrol Division?
lnternal Affairs? What?

126
00:07:37,902 --> 00:07:39,563
l was thinking
Detective Bureau.

127
00:07:44,175 --> 00:07:45,164
Edmund...

128
00:07:45,577 --> 00:07:47,169
...you're a political animal.

129
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:50,439
You have the eye for human weakness,
but not the stomach.

130
00:07:52,684 --> 00:07:53,878
You're wrong, sir.

131
00:07:54,085 --> 00:07:57,816
Would you be willing to plant evidence
on a suspect you knew to be guilty...

132
00:07:58,023 --> 00:07:59,820
...in order to insure an indictment?

133
00:08:00,025 --> 00:08:02,152
-We've been over this.
-Yes or no?

134
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,258
No.

135
00:08:03,595 --> 00:08:07,531
Would you beat a confession
out of a suspect you knew to be guilty?

136
00:08:07,866 --> 00:08:10,733
Would you shoot
a hardened criminal in the back...

137
00:08:10,935 --> 00:08:14,098
...in order to offset the chance
that some lawyer--

138
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:16,406
Then for the love of God...

139
00:08:16,608 --> 00:08:18,337
...don't be a detective.

140
00:08:18,543 --> 00:08:21,239
Work where you don't have
to make those kind of choices.

141
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,771
Dudley, l know you mean well...

142
00:08:24,115 --> 00:08:27,778
...but l don't need to do it
the way you did...or my father.

143
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,985
At least get rid of the glasses.

144
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:34,056
l can't think of a man
on the Bureau who wears them.

145
00:08:43,234 --> 00:08:45,327
lf l get held up,
you guys better be here.

146
00:08:51,309 --> 00:08:52,435
Hi, Nick.

147
00:08:52,644 --> 00:08:54,111
l need a delivery.

148
00:08:54,312 --> 00:08:56,940
A case each of gin, rum, Scotch.

149
00:08:57,148 --> 00:08:59,742
Sounds like a hell of a party.
Be right with you.

150
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:19,762
Merry Christmas.

151
00:09:21,606 --> 00:09:23,540
Merry Christmas to you, officer.

152
00:09:26,277 --> 00:09:27,301
That obvious?

153
00:09:28,179 --> 00:09:30,409
lt's practically
stamped on your forehead.

154
00:09:31,449 --> 00:09:32,541
There you go.

155
00:10:05,683 --> 00:10:07,480
See what he wants, Buzz.

156
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:14,549
Get lost, why don't you?

157
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:24,028
Down!
Get your fucking head down.

158
00:10:24,235 --> 00:10:26,032
l got a license for that.

159
00:10:30,341 --> 00:10:31,706
Cut me some slack.

160
00:10:31,976 --> 00:10:33,102
l used to be a cop.

161
00:10:33,311 --> 00:10:35,370
''Leland Meeks.''
Never heard of you.

162
00:10:35,847 --> 00:10:37,144
They call me Buzz.

163
00:10:38,183 --> 00:10:41,550
l don't give a rat's ass what
they call you. Keep your head down.

164
00:10:41,753 --> 00:10:43,550
And stay there...Buzz.

165
00:10:46,591 --> 00:10:47,853
You okay?

166
00:10:48,359 --> 00:10:49,348
She's fine.

167
00:10:49,761 --> 00:10:51,126
l'm not asking you, sir.

168
00:10:53,131 --> 00:10:54,257
Somebody hit you?

169
00:10:54,465 --> 00:10:56,365
lt's not what you think.

170
00:10:59,871 --> 00:11:00,895
What is it, then?

171
00:11:01,105 --> 00:11:03,573
You got the wrong idea, mister.
l'm fine.

172
00:11:05,109 --> 00:11:07,236
But it's nice to know you care.

173
00:11:16,187 --> 00:11:17,279
Drive safely.

174
00:11:19,224 --> 00:11:20,350
What's going on?

175
00:11:24,395 --> 00:11:25,453
You know him?

176
00:11:25,797 --> 00:11:27,628
Yeah, l've seen him around.

177
00:11:29,467 --> 00:11:31,094
He used to be a cop.

178
00:11:37,775 --> 00:11:40,767
They're sitting in the dark,
goofing on the Christmas tree.

179
00:11:40,979 --> 00:11:42,947
Put your camera right there.

180
00:11:43,147 --> 00:11:47,550
When l walk out, l'll stop here. Get
the movie premiere in the background.

181
00:11:47,752 --> 00:11:50,619
l like it. l like it.
''The Movie Premiere Pot Bust.''

182
00:11:50,822 --> 00:11:53,882
When l walk out, l don't want
your floodlights in my eyes.

183
00:11:54,092 --> 00:11:56,617
Consider it done.
You hear that, Chip?

184
00:11:56,995 --> 00:11:57,984
Come on.

185
00:11:58,263 --> 00:11:59,161
Get down.

186
00:12:03,167 --> 00:12:04,031
Go! Pop them!

187
00:12:08,539 --> 00:12:09,767
Freeze! Police!

188
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:11,868
Jesus Christ!

189
00:12:12,076 --> 00:12:14,408
Come on.
Come on, let's go.

190
00:12:14,612 --> 00:12:15,806
My family's coming in--

191
00:12:16,014 --> 00:12:19,279
-lt'll be a nice Christmas gift.
-Hi, Tammy. Hi, Matt.

192
00:12:19,484 --> 00:12:20,542
Right over here.

193
00:12:20,752 --> 00:12:22,777
-Just turn.
-Hold it. Got it!

194
00:12:23,755 --> 00:12:27,885
-The Movie Premiere Pot Bust!
-Take them in. l'll get the evidence.

195
00:12:40,204 --> 00:12:42,672
''lt's Christmas Eve
in the City of Angels...

196
00:12:42,874 --> 00:12:46,105
...and while decent citizens
sleep the sleep of the righteous...

197
00:12:46,311 --> 00:12:48,745
...hopheads prowl for marijuana...

198
00:12:48,946 --> 00:12:52,279
...not knowing that a man
is coming to stop them:

199
00:12:53,418 --> 00:12:55,978
Celebrity crime-stopper, Jack Vincennes.

200
00:12:56,354 --> 00:13:00,552
Scourge of grasshoppers
and dope fiends everywhere.''

201
00:13:01,292 --> 00:13:02,259
You like it?

202
00:13:04,996 --> 00:13:06,224
Yeah, subtle.

203
00:13:07,732 --> 00:13:08,664
What took you?

204
00:13:08,866 --> 00:13:11,926
My partner stopped
to help a damsel in distress.

205
00:13:12,136 --> 00:13:14,161
His priorities are all screwed up.

206
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:16,739
Up to your old tricks again, Bud?

207
00:13:18,343 --> 00:13:22,177
Hollywood Jack, what brings you
to our humble station house?

208
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,041
-How are you?
-Why are you here?

209
00:13:24,248 --> 00:13:26,239
You know me.
Keeping the streets safe.

210
00:13:26,451 --> 00:13:28,885
Take these two,
get them dressed and book them.

211
00:13:29,187 --> 00:13:31,849
-The party's upstairs.
-Okay, l'll be right up.

212
00:13:38,096 --> 00:13:39,028
What's that for?

213
00:13:39,263 --> 00:13:41,697
You are watch commander tonight,
aren't you?

214
00:13:41,933 --> 00:13:42,831
Yeah. So?

215
00:13:43,034 --> 00:13:44,729
A gratuity from Hush-Hush magazine.

216
00:13:44,936 --> 00:13:46,631
Buy yourself some new loafers.

217
00:13:46,871 --> 00:13:49,339
No thanks, Jack.
You keep your payoff.

218
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:51,266
l'm not interested.

219
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:00,747
What the hell is this?

220
00:14:01,119 --> 00:14:02,279
Six spics.

221
00:14:02,487 --> 00:14:05,854
Mexicans, sir. The ones who assaulted
Brown and Helenowski.

222
00:14:06,057 --> 00:14:08,924
l heard Helenowski bled 6 pints
and Brown's in a coma.

223
00:14:09,127 --> 00:14:10,924
They have bruises
and muscle pulls.

224
00:14:11,129 --> 00:14:12,289
lt's not what l heard.

225
00:14:12,497 --> 00:14:13,794
Get them into lock up.

226
00:14:13,998 --> 00:14:18,833
Stens, you guys hear what those taco
benders did to Helenowski and Brown?

227
00:14:20,071 --> 00:14:24,599
Helenowski lost an eye, and they're
reading Brown his last rites.

228
00:14:26,477 --> 00:14:29,640
That ought to make for
a very merry Christmas for them.

229
00:14:29,847 --> 00:14:30,711
Hey, guys.

230
00:14:31,082 --> 00:14:31,912
Guys.

231
00:14:32,483 --> 00:14:34,075
They brought the Mexicans in.

232
00:14:35,486 --> 00:14:36,783
They're downstairs.

233
00:14:39,157 --> 00:14:41,921
-Let's do it.
-Come on, guys. Let's get them.

234
00:14:44,762 --> 00:14:46,491
Stensland, the party's upstairs.

235
00:14:48,332 --> 00:14:49,924
This doesn't concern you.

236
00:14:50,935 --> 00:14:52,027
Come on, guys.

237
00:14:52,303 --> 00:14:53,463
Haven't you got work?

238
00:14:53,671 --> 00:14:54,831
Go back to the party.

239
00:14:56,107 --> 00:14:59,304
-Come on, it's Christmas, help me out.
-Move it!

240
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,774
l just got a few more questions.

241
00:15:02,113 --> 00:15:03,603
You don't have to be here.

242
00:15:04,182 --> 00:15:05,012
Go!

243
00:15:07,452 --> 00:15:10,979
You better put a leash on your partner
before he kills somebody.

244
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:16,119
Teach him a lesson!
Get him, Stens!

245
00:15:17,361 --> 00:15:19,352
This is for ours, Poncho.

246
00:15:22,266 --> 00:15:23,164
Let me through!

247
00:15:25,036 --> 00:15:26,435
No! He didn't do nothing!

248
00:15:26,637 --> 00:15:29,299
What are you looking at?

249
00:15:29,941 --> 00:15:31,465
Tell that Mexican to shut up!

250
00:15:31,676 --> 00:15:32,506
Move!

251
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:33,968
You're sick!

252
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,269
That's it!

253
00:15:40,351 --> 00:15:41,784
Don't break it up.

254
00:15:42,386 --> 00:15:43,751
Get back! Get back!

255
00:15:44,222 --> 00:15:45,689
Yeah, and fuck your mother!

256
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:46,879
Fuck you!

257
00:15:50,328 --> 00:15:51,920
Stop, officer!
That's an order!

258
00:16:00,938 --> 00:16:02,496
You'll all be in my report!

259
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,892
''Bloody Christmas.''

260
00:16:24,395 --> 00:16:26,260
The press love to label.

261
00:16:27,732 --> 00:16:30,565
You should know this is bigger
than the police board.

262
00:16:30,768 --> 00:16:34,932
The grand jury's convening.
lndictments may be handed down.

263
00:16:35,273 --> 00:16:36,604
Will you testify?

264
00:16:36,908 --> 00:16:37,932
No, sir. l won't.

265
00:16:40,845 --> 00:16:42,073
District Attorney Loew?

266
00:16:43,281 --> 00:16:46,717
You and officer Stensland
brought the liquor to the station.

267
00:16:47,285 --> 00:16:48,843
Stensland was already drunk.

268
00:16:49,954 --> 00:16:52,479
Appearing as a
voluntary witness against him...

269
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:54,624
...could offset damage to yourself.

270
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,926
l won't testify against him,
or anyone else.

271
00:16:58,529 --> 00:17:00,622
This man is a disgrace.

272
00:17:00,898 --> 00:17:02,661
Your badge and gun, officer.

273
00:17:02,867 --> 00:17:04,596
You're suspended from duty.

274
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:07,094
Dismissed.

275
00:17:25,289 --> 00:17:29,419
We need police witnesses to offset
the damage done to the Department.

276
00:17:29,627 --> 00:17:32,790
Justice has to be served.
Of course l'll testify.

277
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,595
l'm glad you feel that way, Edmund.

278
00:17:37,802 --> 00:17:38,928
Most don't.

279
00:17:39,136 --> 00:17:41,798
They think silence and integrity
are the same thing.

280
00:17:42,239 --> 00:17:44,799
Not exactly the image of the...

281
00:17:45,409 --> 00:17:47,274
...new LAPD we're trying to create.

282
00:17:47,478 --> 00:17:50,447
Welcome to Los Angeles,
the city of the future.

283
00:17:50,648 --> 00:17:53,242
-May l make a suggestion, sir?
-By all means.

284
00:17:53,484 --> 00:17:57,750
The public will expect the Department
to sweep this under the carpet.

285
00:17:58,589 --> 00:17:59,647
Don't.

286
00:18:00,157 --> 00:18:03,126
Shift the guilt to men
whose pensions are secured.

287
00:18:03,327 --> 00:18:04,988
Force them to retire.

288
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:08,330
But somebody has to swing.

289
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:11,432
So indict, try and convict...

290
00:18:11,936 --> 00:18:13,665
...Richard Stensland and Bud White.

291
00:18:14,138 --> 00:18:15,867
Secure them jail time.

292
00:18:16,107 --> 00:18:17,734
The message will be clear.

293
00:18:18,275 --> 00:18:19,572
This Department...

294
00:18:19,777 --> 00:18:23,269
...will not tolerate officers
who think they're above the law.

295
00:18:24,281 --> 00:18:27,250
Dick Stensland is an embarrassment
as a policeman.

296
00:18:27,451 --> 00:18:31,114
He's had rotten fitness reports
from every C.O. he's served under.

297
00:18:31,689 --> 00:18:33,748
But Bud White is a valuable officer.

298
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:35,585
White's a mindless thug.

299
00:18:35,793 --> 00:18:37,488
No, Edmund...

300
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:41,688
...but he can answer ''yes'' to those
questions l've asked you before.

301
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:45,268
The Department and the public
need role models.

302
00:18:45,469 --> 00:18:48,563
Clean-cut, forthright men
the public can admire.

303
00:18:50,207 --> 00:18:51,139
Sergeant...

304
00:18:51,642 --> 00:18:53,303
...l'll promote you...

305
00:18:53,544 --> 00:18:55,034
...to lieutenant...

306
00:18:55,312 --> 00:18:56,836
...effective immediately.

307
00:18:57,048 --> 00:18:58,208
Detective Lieutenant.

308
00:19:00,484 --> 00:19:02,145
Ed, you're 30.

309
00:19:02,386 --> 00:19:06,015
Your father didn't make lieutenant
till he was 33.

310
00:19:06,223 --> 00:19:10,216
l know that, sir. When he made
lieutenant, it was as a detective.

311
00:19:10,394 --> 00:19:12,794
Before we start polishing our laurels...

312
00:19:12,997 --> 00:19:15,659
...it'd look better if we had
a corroborative witness.

313
00:19:16,067 --> 00:19:19,525
That won't be easy to come by.
The men hate a stool pigeon.

314
00:19:19,737 --> 00:19:21,329
Jack Vincennes.

315
00:19:21,739 --> 00:19:23,934
He hit one of the Mexicans.

316
00:19:24,575 --> 00:19:28,341
A veteran like Vincennes might be
willing to admit his own culpability...

317
00:19:28,846 --> 00:19:31,110
...but he'd never rat out
a fellow officer.

318
00:19:31,749 --> 00:19:34,809
Jack's the technical advisor
on Badge of Honor.

319
00:19:35,019 --> 00:19:36,350
He lives for it.

320
00:19:36,587 --> 00:19:38,350
That's how to get to him.

321
00:19:41,692 --> 00:19:43,922
l'd like you to observe, Ed.

322
00:19:47,598 --> 00:19:49,190
Call Sergeant Vincennes.

323
00:19:49,934 --> 00:19:51,367
Bright kid.

324
00:19:51,702 --> 00:19:53,602
You may reap the benefit...

325
00:19:54,038 --> 00:19:56,700
...but are you ready to be despised
in the Department?

326
00:19:57,374 --> 00:19:58,773
Yes, sir, l am.

327
00:20:00,878 --> 00:20:01,867
So be it.

328
00:20:08,052 --> 00:20:10,384
Sergeant, we'll get right to it.

329
00:20:10,888 --> 00:20:15,018
Nine civilian witnesses have identified
you as hitting Ezekiel Garcia.

330
00:20:15,226 --> 00:20:19,959
But we have a witness who will name
names and testify that you hit back...

331
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:21,958
...only after being hit.

332
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:24,594
You will testify against 3 officers...

333
00:20:24,802 --> 00:20:29,569
...who have earned their pensions
and plead ignorance about the rest.

334
00:20:29,974 --> 00:20:31,942
No thanks.
l'm not a snitch.

335
00:20:32,143 --> 00:20:35,601
l'll guarantee you a slap on the wrist,
a brief suspension...

336
00:20:35,813 --> 00:20:39,146
...followed by a temporary transfer
from Narcotics to Vice.

337
00:20:39,483 --> 00:20:42,247
You transfer out of Vice,
you'll be back on the show.

338
00:20:47,258 --> 00:20:48,316
The show?

339
00:20:48,826 --> 00:20:50,487
Badge of Honor, Vincennes.

340
00:20:52,096 --> 00:20:54,929
We need to tone down
your profile for a bit.

341
00:20:57,334 --> 00:21:01,634
l doubt you've ever taken
a stupid breath. Don't start now.

342
00:21:02,173 --> 00:21:03,470
Okay, l'll do it.

343
00:21:07,344 --> 00:21:08,811
The grand jury will hear...

344
00:21:09,013 --> 00:21:11,174
...your testimony tomorrow.

345
00:21:22,459 --> 00:21:24,450
And so it goes...

346
00:21:24,862 --> 00:21:26,693
...Detective Lieutenant.

347
00:21:28,465 --> 00:21:30,956
Ace them at the
grand jury tomorrow, son.

348
00:21:31,202 --> 00:21:33,966
Wear a smart-looking suit
and ace them.

349
00:21:34,872 --> 00:21:35,998
And Ed...

350
00:21:36,207 --> 00:21:37,868
...lose the glasses.

351
00:21:48,219 --> 00:21:50,983
So you're the stellar witness.

352
00:21:51,222 --> 00:21:54,817
l should have known.
What's the Chief throwing you?

353
00:21:55,226 --> 00:21:56,215
Throwing me?

354
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,323
Yeah, Exley, what's the payoff?

355
00:21:58,662 --> 00:22:00,493
You're the payoff expert.

356
00:22:00,898 --> 00:22:01,956
l'm just doing my duty.

357
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:05,693
Come on, you're playing
an angle here, college boy.

358
00:22:05,903 --> 00:22:09,134
You'll get something so you
don't have to hobnob with the cops...

359
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,069
...who'll hate you for snitching.

360
00:22:11,408 --> 00:22:14,002
lf they're making you detective,
watch out.

361
00:22:14,511 --> 00:22:18,709
Some Bureau guys will burn in this and
you'll be working with their friends.

362
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:19,848
What about you?

363
00:22:20,584 --> 00:22:24,748
l'm snitching 3 old-timers who'll be
fishing in Oregon next week.

364
00:22:25,089 --> 00:22:27,023
Next to you, l'm clean...

365
00:22:27,258 --> 00:22:28,520
...and smart.

366
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:31,250
Edmund J. Exley to chambers.

367
00:22:33,597 --> 00:22:34,655
And remember...

368
00:22:34,865 --> 00:22:38,323
...Bud White will fuck you for this
if it takes the rest of his life.

369
00:22:42,206 --> 00:22:43,867
Captain, what do you want?

370
00:22:44,942 --> 00:22:46,204
Call me Dudley.

371
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:48,371
Dudley...

372
00:22:48,946 --> 00:22:49,878
...what do you want?

373
00:22:51,115 --> 00:22:54,607
Look, lad, l admire
your refusal to testify...

374
00:22:55,052 --> 00:22:57,043
...and your loyalty to your partner.

375
00:22:57,554 --> 00:22:59,522
l admire you as a policeman...

376
00:22:59,723 --> 00:23:04,285
...and your adherence to violence
as a necessary adjunct to the job.

377
00:23:05,062 --> 00:23:07,553
l'm impressed with your
punishment of women-beaters.

378
00:23:08,632 --> 00:23:09,792
Do you hate them, Wendell?

379
00:23:12,403 --> 00:23:13,563
What do you want?

380
00:23:18,075 --> 00:23:19,474
They're yours.

381
00:23:20,911 --> 00:23:21,741
Take them.

382
00:23:25,416 --> 00:23:26,883
There's no bill on me?

383
00:23:27,084 --> 00:23:29,609
-4 witnesses recanted their testimony.
-Why?

384
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,219
They had a change of heart.

385
00:23:31,422 --> 00:23:32,252
Stensland?

386
00:23:32,656 --> 00:23:34,248
Your partner's through.

387
00:23:34,491 --> 00:23:36,618
Scapegoat on the Chief's orders.

388
00:23:36,827 --> 00:23:38,761
A year from his pension.

389
00:23:41,932 --> 00:23:45,095
-Exley!
-Exley got what he wanted.

390
00:23:45,336 --> 00:23:48,669
As a politician he exceeds even myself.

391
00:23:49,506 --> 00:23:52,339
The Department needs
smart men like Exley...

392
00:23:52,843 --> 00:23:54,276
...and direct men...

393
00:23:54,945 --> 00:23:56,105
...like you.

394
00:23:57,514 --> 00:24:01,507
Look, l need you for an assignment
the Chief's given me.

395
00:24:01,852 --> 00:24:04,184
A duty few men are fit for...

396
00:24:04,455 --> 00:24:06,013
...but you were born for.

397
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:09,318
You'd be working
out of Homicide at City Hall.

398
00:24:09,526 --> 00:24:10,686
Homicide?

399
00:24:11,695 --> 00:24:13,219
Working cases?

400
00:24:14,365 --> 00:24:16,959
Your talents lie elsewhere, Wendell.

401
00:24:17,534 --> 00:24:19,161
lt's a muscle job.

402
00:24:20,371 --> 00:24:24,535
You'll do as l say and ask no questions.
Do you follow my drift?

403
00:24:25,809 --> 00:24:27,367
ln Technicolor, sir.

404
00:24:30,147 --> 00:24:33,446
''Meet Tony Brancato
and Anthony Trombino...

405
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:36,949
...two rising lieutenants
in the Mickey Cohen rackets.

406
00:24:37,154 --> 00:24:39,987
With the dapper little gent in prison...

407
00:24:40,657 --> 00:24:43,558
...who knows how far they'll go.
The sky's the limit.

408
00:24:50,334 --> 00:24:51,232
Oh, well.''

409
00:25:04,348 --> 00:25:08,808
''Meet Deuce Perkins,
Mickey Cohen's narcotics lieutenant.

410
00:25:09,019 --> 00:25:10,509
Could he be behind the hits?

411
00:25:11,188 --> 00:25:14,021
ls he consolidating
organized crime power?

412
00:25:20,097 --> 00:25:21,758
l suppose not.

413
00:25:27,271 --> 00:25:28,829
One thing's for sure:

414
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:32,372
2-man triggers are punching the tickets
on the Mickster's muscle.''

415
00:25:41,618 --> 00:25:45,520
''Meanwhile, rumor has it the LAPD...

416
00:25:45,722 --> 00:25:50,591
...has set up a not-so-Welcome Wagon
to dishearten the criminal element...

417
00:25:50,794 --> 00:25:54,093
...from filling the void left by
Mickey's absence.

418
00:25:54,298 --> 00:25:57,233
When l know more, dear readers,
so will you.

419
00:25:57,468 --> 00:26:00,130
Off the record, on the q.t...

420
00:26:00,571 --> 00:26:02,095
...and very...

421
00:26:02,306 --> 00:26:04,137
...Hush-Hush.''

422
00:26:05,309 --> 00:26:09,302
With Mickey Cohen in prison,
Los Angeles is organized crime-free.

423
00:26:09,646 --> 00:26:11,409
The Chief wants to keep it that way.

424
00:26:12,649 --> 00:26:15,709
ln Cleveland, you're an
organized crime associate...

425
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,753
...in desperate need of re-education
in the ways of polite society.

426
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:23,956
l hear things.

427
00:26:24,161 --> 00:26:26,129
Like those 2-men shooter teams.

428
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:28,457
They're 86ing Cohen's lieutenants.

429
00:26:28,665 --> 00:26:30,257
What do you want?

430
00:26:31,001 --> 00:26:32,764
We want you to go home.

431
00:26:37,441 --> 00:26:39,136
Picture-book smut, men.

432
00:26:39,343 --> 00:26:43,006
There's been a bunch of this
found at crime scenes lately.

433
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:46,181
Quality ranges from piss-poor to...

434
00:26:47,451 --> 00:26:48,349
...very well done.

435
00:26:48,852 --> 00:26:51,343
Look who's back from suspension.

436
00:26:52,122 --> 00:26:54,147
We're honored, Sergeant Jack.

437
00:26:54,358 --> 00:26:57,794
Look at that.
The Great Jerk-Off Case of 1953.

438
00:26:58,128 --> 00:27:00,323
ls there someplace you'd rather be?

439
00:27:00,864 --> 00:27:04,095
Yeah, working Narcotics,
looking for Cohen's missing H.

440
00:27:04,301 --> 00:27:08,431
Yeah, finding 25 pounds of heroin
would get you plenty of ink.

441
00:27:08,639 --> 00:27:11,699
You should've thought of that
before Bloody Christmas.

442
00:27:12,809 --> 00:27:16,506
Make a major case. lt's the only way
you'll get out of here.

443
00:27:18,148 --> 00:27:19,547
Dismissed, gentlemen.

444
00:27:27,724 --> 00:27:29,692
Go get the facts, Jack.

445
00:27:29,893 --> 00:27:31,724
Just the facts.

446
00:27:39,236 --> 00:27:40,794
Whatever you desire.

447
00:27:41,004 --> 00:27:43,802
Hi. l'd like to get a delivery
to Beverly Hills.

448
00:27:44,007 --> 00:27:45,065
l don't know you.

449
00:27:45,576 --> 00:27:50,104
A friend just gave me this number
and l wanted to find out if--

450
00:27:51,081 --> 00:27:55,142
Would you grab a reverse directory
and shag a name and address for me?

451
00:27:55,352 --> 00:27:57,252
Crestview-2239.

452
00:28:04,528 --> 00:28:06,860
Hush-Hush, off the record
and on the q.t.

453
00:28:07,264 --> 00:28:08,993
Sid, it's Vincennes.

454
00:28:09,199 --> 00:28:12,566
Jackie, you back on narco?
l need some good copy.

455
00:28:12,769 --> 00:28:14,828
l have something going with Vice.

456
00:28:15,038 --> 00:28:16,665
Something juicy for the Sidster?

457
00:28:16,873 --> 00:28:19,103
Tracking porn.
Arty, high-class stuff.

458
00:28:19,309 --> 00:28:22,403
Know about Fleur-de-Lis?
Slogan's ''Whatever you desire.''

459
00:28:22,613 --> 00:28:24,240
No, l've heard bupkes.

460
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:28,077
Get me some narco skinny.
l want to do an all-hophead issue.

461
00:28:28,285 --> 00:28:32,221
Shvartze jazz musicians and movie stars.
You like it?

462
00:28:32,389 --> 00:28:33,913
l'll talk to you later.

463
00:28:34,124 --> 00:28:36,615
-What do you got?
-The number's not assigned.

464
00:28:36,827 --> 00:28:37,953
Thanks, Ginger.

465
00:28:39,796 --> 00:28:41,127
A bootleg.

466
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,434
Take it easy.

467
00:28:51,642 --> 00:28:53,109
Tough break, Stens.

468
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:55,437
We're going to miss you.

469
00:28:55,646 --> 00:28:57,307
Raw deal, Stensland.

470
00:29:00,751 --> 00:29:02,480
Here comes the snitch.

471
00:29:13,664 --> 00:29:15,325
Sorry about that, Lieutenant.

472
00:29:32,282 --> 00:29:34,113
Stay out of trouble, Bud.

473
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:38,815
l got a few hours.
l'll buy you a drink.

474
00:29:39,022 --> 00:29:41,183
Rain check.
l got a hot date.

475
00:29:43,126 --> 00:29:45,356
Who is she and
what did you arrest her for?

476
00:29:45,796 --> 00:29:47,263
lt's confidential.

477
00:29:47,464 --> 00:29:52,367
Like that magazine that
Vincennes scams for. Hush-Hush.

478
00:29:53,537 --> 00:29:55,368
l'll see you later in the week.

479
00:29:55,972 --> 00:29:57,940
We'll do the town, on me.

480
00:29:58,141 --> 00:30:01,133
Yeah. l'll bring
my wallet just in case.

481
00:30:05,482 --> 00:30:07,643
-See you tomorrow.
-Hang on!

482
00:30:08,485 --> 00:30:09,975
l'll walk down with you.

483
00:30:18,562 --> 00:30:21,224
Punk kid.
Who is he trying to impress?

484
00:30:22,165 --> 00:30:23,462
Yeah, l wonder.

485
00:30:23,667 --> 00:30:25,897
Got himself a real career going.

486
00:30:30,173 --> 00:30:32,607
Sergeant Williams, pick up, please.

487
00:30:33,744 --> 00:30:35,405
Sergeant Williams?

488
00:30:38,682 --> 00:30:41,515
ls there anybody up there in Homicide?

489
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:44,077
Anybody there?

490
00:30:46,356 --> 00:30:47,550
Lieutenant Exley.

491
00:30:47,758 --> 00:30:49,726
You've got a homicide downtown.

492
00:30:49,926 --> 00:30:52,861
-The Nite Owl Coffee Shop.
-l got it.

493
00:30:53,029 --> 00:30:54,189
lt's mine.

494
00:31:05,776 --> 00:31:08,574
At least one person's dead.
l stopped for coffee.

495
00:31:08,779 --> 00:31:11,612
No one comes through the front door.
Understand?

496
00:32:47,811 --> 00:32:51,804
l want barricades at both ends
of the street. Make sure--

497
00:32:52,148 --> 00:32:54,139
l took the call. lt's my case.

498
00:32:54,718 --> 00:32:56,948
You don't want it and you can't have it.

499
00:32:57,153 --> 00:32:58,177
l took the call.

500
00:32:58,388 --> 00:32:59,548
lt's mine.

501
00:33:00,557 --> 00:33:02,525
l'll make you my second-in-command.

502
00:33:02,726 --> 00:33:04,489
Captain, over here, please.

503
00:33:08,732 --> 00:33:13,169
The cook drew a gun and set it off.
The rest died in the men's room.

504
00:33:17,674 --> 00:33:18,834
Sir...

505
00:33:19,075 --> 00:33:22,806
...we got a total of 15 spent
12-gauge Remington shotgun shells.

506
00:33:23,013 --> 00:33:27,143
l'm betting 3 men, 5-shot capacity
pumps, all of them emptying once.

507
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:30,342
Excuse me, we got an l.D.
on one of the victims.

508
00:33:30,921 --> 00:33:32,286
lt's Dick Stensland.

509
00:33:34,925 --> 00:33:37,485
At first, l thought
she was Rita Hayworth.

510
00:33:37,694 --> 00:33:39,093
Yeah, me too.

511
00:33:48,838 --> 00:33:50,965
Hell of a way to avoid prison.

512
00:34:01,651 --> 00:34:02,913
What happened?

513
00:34:03,486 --> 00:34:06,046
Appears 3 men held up a coffee shop.

514
00:34:06,256 --> 00:34:09,089
The guy at the register pulled a .38,
so they killed him.

515
00:34:09,593 --> 00:34:11,322
Then they killed everyone else.

516
00:34:14,264 --> 00:34:17,324
Lieutenant, we're ready
with that Nite Owl l.D.

517
00:34:22,839 --> 00:34:24,773
ls this your daughter?

518
00:34:25,508 --> 00:34:27,169
l don't know.

519
00:34:27,944 --> 00:34:30,606
We know this is difficult.
Take your time.

520
00:34:32,349 --> 00:34:34,647
lt seems like my Susan.

521
00:34:34,851 --> 00:34:37,752
But my Susan was a blonde,
not a redhead.

522
00:34:37,954 --> 00:34:39,854
When was the last time you saw her?

523
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:42,281
Just before Christmas.

524
00:34:42,859 --> 00:34:45,794
We'd fought.
l didn't like her boyfriend.

525
00:34:46,363 --> 00:34:47,591
Mrs. Lefferts...

526
00:34:47,797 --> 00:34:50,288
...does your daughter have
any distinguishing marks?

527
00:34:51,368 --> 00:34:54,303
You got the wrong idea, mister.
l'm fine.

528
00:34:55,138 --> 00:34:58,301
She has a birthmark on her hip.

529
00:35:04,147 --> 00:35:05,705
lt's her.

530
00:35:06,383 --> 00:35:08,476
My baby!

531
00:35:11,721 --> 00:35:13,552
l'm sorry, Mrs. Lefferts.

532
00:35:14,724 --> 00:35:17,090
Who's in charge of this investigation?

533
00:35:17,527 --> 00:35:19,017
Captain Smith and myself.
Why?

534
00:35:21,698 --> 00:35:23,097
''The Nite Owl Massacre.''

535
00:35:23,299 --> 00:35:25,096
Hyperbole aside...

536
00:35:25,301 --> 00:35:28,964
...this is a heinous crime
that requires swift resolution.

537
00:35:29,973 --> 00:35:30,997
Six victims.

538
00:35:31,207 --> 00:35:33,869
One of them, one of our own.
Dick Stensland.

539
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:38,408
He was a Nite Owl regular,
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

540
00:35:38,882 --> 00:35:40,850
Robbery is the likely motive.

541
00:35:41,051 --> 00:35:45,511
We have rubber glove smears
on the register and forensics...

542
00:35:45,722 --> 00:35:49,488
...tend toward a trio of shooters.
We do have one hot lead.

543
00:35:49,893 --> 00:35:51,861
Three Negro juveniles...

544
00:35:52,062 --> 00:35:55,657
...were seen discharging shotguns
in Griffith Park.

545
00:35:55,899 --> 00:35:59,960
A park ranger l.D.'d them
as driving a 1948-1950 Mercury coupe...

546
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:01,501
...maroon in color.

547
00:36:02,005 --> 00:36:05,668
An hour ago a canvassing crew
found a news vendor...

548
00:36:05,842 --> 00:36:09,573
...who saw a maroon Merc coupe
parked by the Nite Owl at 1 a.m.

549
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:13,846
DMV has come up with
a registration list of Merc coupes.

550
00:36:15,085 --> 00:36:19,579
48 two-man teams will shake
three names apiece.

551
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:22,884
lnterrogations will be led by
Lt. Edmund Exley.

552
00:36:26,296 --> 00:36:27,729
Enough on that!

553
00:36:30,967 --> 00:36:34,630
Gentlemen, just go out and get them.
Use all necessary force.

554
00:36:35,739 --> 00:36:37,969
The people of Los Angeles demand it.

555
00:36:38,575 --> 00:36:39,906
Dismissed.

556
00:36:43,246 --> 00:36:45,305
Why not just put a bounty on them?

557
00:36:52,589 --> 00:36:55,752
-Ready to roll?
-You take them, l got something to do.

558
00:36:55,925 --> 00:36:57,893
What if one of these names--?

559
00:36:58,094 --> 00:36:59,652
Get somebody else.

560
00:37:00,497 --> 00:37:02,727
l got our assignments, Big V.

561
00:37:02,932 --> 00:37:05,958
We go by this list, we got
zero chance of making this collar.

562
00:37:06,169 --> 00:37:10,333
l got a guy who knows what happens south
of Jefferson. He'll put us at 50-50.

563
00:37:11,107 --> 00:37:12,267
What are you doing?

564
00:37:12,675 --> 00:37:15,303
lt's the same sort of thing
that got you in trouble before.

565
00:37:15,512 --> 00:37:16,945
l'll take those odds.

566
00:37:21,017 --> 00:37:22,507
We got it from here.

567
00:37:24,621 --> 00:37:27,146
You two should
bring along a photographer.

568
00:37:32,195 --> 00:37:35,653
l need an address on a customer
of yours. Her name is Lynn.

569
00:37:35,865 --> 00:37:37,696
-That's all l got to go on?
-Yeah.

570
00:37:38,034 --> 00:37:40,525
You already know who l mean,
so cough it up.

571
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:44,033
There's a billing address
and a delivery address.

572
00:38:10,733 --> 00:38:12,496
Are you Pierce Patchett?

573
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:14,901
l am.

574
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:21,004
Are you soliciting for police charities?
Last time you called my office.

575
00:38:21,411 --> 00:38:24,346
Go on down to the driveway.
We'll talk there.

576
00:38:35,358 --> 00:38:36,916
What can l do for you?

577
00:38:37,927 --> 00:38:41,522
-Where were you last night?
-l was here hosting a party.

578
00:38:43,266 --> 00:38:44,995
Tell me about Dick Stensland.

579
00:38:45,201 --> 00:38:47,362
l don't know him, Mr.--?

580
00:38:47,704 --> 00:38:49,103
Officer White.

581
00:38:50,206 --> 00:38:51,434
You know Sue Lefferts?

582
00:38:51,774 --> 00:38:54,038
You know l do.
You saw me with her.

583
00:38:55,778 --> 00:38:57,439
How did you find me?

584
00:38:58,047 --> 00:39:02,211
Nick's Liquor. This is where
Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.

585
00:39:02,452 --> 00:39:04,044
Of course.

586
00:39:06,956 --> 00:39:09,117
Sue Lefferts died at the Nite Owl.

587
00:39:09,726 --> 00:39:11,387
l'm investigating.

588
00:39:13,563 --> 00:39:15,121
Everything all right?

589
00:39:15,565 --> 00:39:17,465
Fine, Phillip, thank you.

590
00:39:21,638 --> 00:39:24,129
What happened to the other guy, Buzz?

591
00:39:24,474 --> 00:39:26,772
Buzz Meeks no longer works for me.

592
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:29,444
Lefferts looked beat-up Christmas Eve
but didn't act it. Why?

593
00:39:29,646 --> 00:39:33,946
l think she'd been hit in the face
with a tennis racket. She is...was...

594
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:35,481
...a big doubles fan.

595
00:39:36,319 --> 00:39:39,311
You're a known associate of a woman
killed in a mass murder.

596
00:39:40,823 --> 00:39:44,486
-Want to go downtown to discuss this?
-ls this official?

597
00:39:45,261 --> 00:39:49,823
Somehow l have the feeling
this is more personal with you.

598
00:39:53,102 --> 00:39:54,592
All right, then...

599
00:39:55,438 --> 00:39:59,875
...are you concerned about criminal
matters peripheral to the murders?

600
00:40:00,109 --> 00:40:03,510
-Not at the moment.
-You're not obligated to report them?

601
00:40:05,848 --> 00:40:08,009
Why were Lefferts' eyes black?

602
00:40:08,351 --> 00:40:11,149
l needed a Rita Hayworth
to fill out my little studio.

603
00:40:11,354 --> 00:40:12,480
What little studio?

604
00:40:12,689 --> 00:40:16,318
Well, there's Gardner, Russell,
Monroe, Turner....

605
00:40:16,526 --> 00:40:18,858
Lynn Bracken is my Veronica Lake.

606
00:40:19,362 --> 00:40:21,830
l use girls that look like movie stars.

607
00:40:22,031 --> 00:40:24,625
Sometimes l employ a plastic surgeon.

608
00:40:25,201 --> 00:40:27,635
When the work was done,
that's when you saw us.

609
00:40:28,471 --> 00:40:30,200
lt's why her mom couldn't l.D. her.

610
00:40:31,808 --> 00:40:33,275
Jesus fucking Christ!

611
00:40:33,476 --> 00:40:35,535
No, Pierce Morehouse Patchett.

612
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:41,372
l sense you're on your best behavior,
but that's all l'm saying.

613
00:40:41,818 --> 00:40:43,877
lf you persist,
we'll meet with my attorney.

614
00:40:44,988 --> 00:40:47,183
Would you like Lynn Bracken's address?

615
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:49,051
l got her address.

616
00:40:50,326 --> 00:40:52,385
Find Susan's killer, Mr. White.

617
00:40:52,895 --> 00:40:54,988
l'll give you a handsome reward.

618
00:41:00,236 --> 00:41:01,225
Whatever you desire!

619
00:41:09,912 --> 00:41:11,504
l know you're not asleep.

620
00:41:13,916 --> 00:41:15,884
What do you want?

621
00:41:16,085 --> 00:41:17,712
My 5 bucks.

622
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,354
lt was the only one l had.

623
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:21,750
Right now?

624
00:41:22,258 --> 00:41:24,726
Hey, doll face,
tell him to leave us alone.

625
00:41:24,927 --> 00:41:27,259
l understand.
Okay, fine.

626
00:41:28,765 --> 00:41:29,925
Oh, baby...

627
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,565
...bad news.

628
00:41:32,769 --> 00:41:33,895
You have to go.

629
00:41:34,103 --> 00:41:35,263
Go?

630
00:41:35,605 --> 00:41:39,063
Something very important has come up
and you have to go.

631
00:41:39,275 --> 00:41:41,175
l'll make it up to you.

632
00:41:41,377 --> 00:41:43,937
l will, l promise.
Excuse me.

633
00:41:46,449 --> 00:41:47,882
ls it the cops?

634
00:41:52,455 --> 00:41:53,752
Miss Bracken...

635
00:41:53,956 --> 00:41:54,923
...l'm Officer White.

636
00:41:55,124 --> 00:41:57,718
l've been expecting you,
just not this soon.

637
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,588
Pierce called.
He told me what happened to Sue.

638
00:42:00,797 --> 00:42:03,891
Everything all right, doll?
Want me to get rid of him?

639
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,130
Hit the road.

640
00:42:07,637 --> 00:42:09,070
Maybe l will...

641
00:42:09,639 --> 00:42:11,072
...maybe l won't.

642
00:42:11,474 --> 00:42:15,069
LAPD. Get out of here
or l'll have your wife come get you.

643
00:42:31,661 --> 00:42:33,219
-Officer.
-Councilman.

644
00:42:51,848 --> 00:42:55,340
-Would you care for a drink?
-Yeah, Scotch straight.

645
00:43:01,124 --> 00:43:04,787
l was friendly with Sue Lefferts,
but we weren't friends.

646
00:43:05,128 --> 00:43:06,459
Know what l mean?

647
00:43:06,863 --> 00:43:08,524
You sorry she's dead?

648
00:43:10,299 --> 00:43:11,789
Of course l am.

649
00:43:12,135 --> 00:43:14,035
What kind of question is that?

650
00:43:16,205 --> 00:43:18,469
Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?

651
00:43:18,708 --> 00:43:21,040
Use words like that,
you might make me mad.

652
00:43:21,377 --> 00:43:22,537
But, do you know?

653
00:43:22,812 --> 00:43:23,972
Yeah, l know.

654
00:43:24,981 --> 00:43:26,812
Patchett's running whores...

655
00:43:28,084 --> 00:43:30,109
...cut to look like movie stars.

656
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:33,777
And, judging by his address,
something bigger on the side.

657
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:35,890
He doesn't want any attention.

658
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:39,686
That's right. Our motives are selfish
so we're cooperating.

659
00:43:39,896 --> 00:43:42,831
So cooperate. Why was
Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?

660
00:43:43,232 --> 00:43:45,792
l don't know. l never heard of
the Nite Owl till today.

661
00:43:46,002 --> 00:43:47,026
How'd she meet Patchett?

662
00:43:47,236 --> 00:43:48,965
Pierce meets people.

663
00:43:49,172 --> 00:43:53,006
Sue had dreams of Hollywood
and this is how they turned out.

664
00:43:53,576 --> 00:43:57,342
Thanks to Pierce,
we still get to act a little.

665
00:43:57,914 --> 00:44:00,246
Tell me about Pierce.

666
00:44:00,583 --> 00:44:02,608
He's waiting for you to mention money.

667
00:44:03,853 --> 00:44:05,480
Want advice, Miss Bracken?

668
00:44:05,688 --> 00:44:07,019
lt's Lynn.

669
00:44:07,423 --> 00:44:08,685
Miss Bracken...

670
00:44:09,592 --> 00:44:12,060
...don't ever try to fucking bribe me...

671
00:44:12,261 --> 00:44:14,695
...or l'll have you and Patchett
in shit up to your ears.

672
00:44:15,765 --> 00:44:18,199
l remember you from Christmas Eve.

673
00:44:19,435 --> 00:44:22,563
You have a thing
for helping women, don't you?

674
00:44:23,439 --> 00:44:25,202
Maybe l'm just fucking curious.

675
00:44:25,541 --> 00:44:28,874
-You say ''fuck'' a lot.
-You fuck for money.

676
00:44:29,111 --> 00:44:30,669
There's blood on your shirt.

677
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,677
An integral part of your job?

678
00:44:32,882 --> 00:44:34,611
-Yeah.
-Do you enjoy it?

679
00:44:34,817 --> 00:44:35,841
When they deserve it.

680
00:44:36,052 --> 00:44:37,542
Did they deserve it today?

681
00:44:39,222 --> 00:44:40,280
l'm not sure.

682
00:44:40,556 --> 00:44:41,955
-But you did it anyway.
-Yeah.

683
00:44:42,725 --> 00:44:44,955
Like the half dozen guys
you screwed today.

684
00:44:46,229 --> 00:44:48,254
Actually, it was only two.

685
00:44:50,733 --> 00:44:52,667
You're different, Officer White.

686
00:44:52,902 --> 00:44:57,396
You're the first man in years who didn't
tell me l look like Veronica Lake.

687
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,403
You look better than Veronica Lake.

688
00:45:04,981 --> 00:45:05,970
Pierce Patchett?

689
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:10,448
He takes a cut of our earnings
and invests it for us.

690
00:45:10,653 --> 00:45:13,816
He doesn't let us use narcotics
and he doesn't abuse us.

691
00:45:14,156 --> 00:45:17,990
Can your policeman's mentality
grasp those contradictions?

692
00:45:20,162 --> 00:45:22,460
He had you cut
to look like Veronica Lake.

693
00:45:22,665 --> 00:45:23,654
No.

694
00:45:24,267 --> 00:45:27,168
l'm really a brunette,
but the rest is me.

695
00:45:29,005 --> 00:45:31,599
And that's all the news
that's fit to print.

696
00:45:32,842 --> 00:45:34,833
lt's nice meeting you.

697
00:45:39,515 --> 00:45:41,779
-l'd like to see you again.
-For a date...

698
00:45:41,951 --> 00:45:43,282
...or an appointment?

699
00:45:45,288 --> 00:45:46,448
l don't know.

700
00:45:46,689 --> 00:45:50,420
-For a date, l'd know your first name.
-Forget l asked.

701
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:52,950
lt was a mistake.

702
00:46:13,549 --> 00:46:14,982
Leonard Bidwell?

703
00:46:16,152 --> 00:46:18,143
Come down here and talk to us.

704
00:46:20,222 --> 00:46:21,553
How's the left these days?

705
00:46:22,058 --> 00:46:23,116
What's it to you?

706
00:46:23,326 --> 00:46:24,987
l saw you fight Kid Gavilan.

707
00:46:25,328 --> 00:46:26,989
l like your style.

708
00:46:29,498 --> 00:46:31,398
What do you want, Mr. Policeman?

709
00:46:32,168 --> 00:46:34,693
You got a brother in Folsom.
l put him there.

710
00:46:34,904 --> 00:46:35,962
Until 1970.

711
00:46:36,172 --> 00:46:38,231
How'd you like to make it 1960?

712
00:46:38,507 --> 00:46:40,873
l know the judge,
and Lieutenant Exley...

713
00:46:41,077 --> 00:46:43,238
...is good friends with the D.A.

714
00:46:45,848 --> 00:46:49,215
We're looking for 3 colored guys
who like to shoot shotguns.

715
00:46:49,418 --> 00:46:51,579
One owns a maroon Mercury coupe.

716
00:46:51,921 --> 00:46:55,049
-Want me to snitch?
-Want to buy your brother 10 years?

717
00:46:55,257 --> 00:46:57,157
-lt was 10 years, right?
-Yeah, 10 years.

718
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:00,591
You don't have to say anything,
just look at this list...

719
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:02,397
...and point.

720
00:47:04,767 --> 00:47:06,758
He's bad, so l'll just tell you.

721
00:47:07,203 --> 00:47:08,568
Sugar Ray Collins.

722
00:47:08,771 --> 00:47:11,035
Drives a maroon '49 coupe.

723
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:13,201
Beautiful ride.

724
00:47:13,876 --> 00:47:18,108
Don't know about shotguns,
but he gets his thrills killing dogs.

725
00:47:18,381 --> 00:47:19,712
He's righteous trash.

726
00:47:20,116 --> 00:47:23,279
Look at that. lt's five minutes
from here. Thanks.

727
00:47:25,454 --> 00:47:26,944
l'll hear from you...

728
00:47:27,957 --> 00:47:29,424
...about my brother?

729
00:47:29,625 --> 00:47:31,889
Keep it up, Lenny. Up!

730
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:40,164
There it is.
lt's in the back.

731
00:47:57,486 --> 00:48:00,080
-One of ours.
-Shit, somebody beat us here!

732
00:48:06,162 --> 00:48:07,424
Damn it!

733
00:48:07,997 --> 00:48:09,396
My glasses!

734
00:48:09,598 --> 00:48:10,826
You're kidding!

735
00:48:12,334 --> 00:48:14,325
Well, just don't shoot me.

736
00:48:23,112 --> 00:48:24,943
What are you doing here?

737
00:48:25,948 --> 00:48:27,677
We were in the neighborhood.

738
00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:31,442
-What do you got?
-Three 12-gauge pumps.

739
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:32,450
And cash.

740
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:37,488
So long, Vice.
Badge of Honor, here l come.

741
00:48:37,693 --> 00:48:39,490
Fuck you!
This is our collar.

742
00:48:39,695 --> 00:48:40,821
Quiet!

743
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:44,659
l'm ranking officer here.
We go as a team. End of story.

744
00:48:49,972 --> 00:48:51,030
Right.

745
00:48:52,374 --> 00:48:53,500
How many ways in?

746
00:48:53,709 --> 00:48:55,973
Only one.
Up the stairs.

747
00:48:57,379 --> 00:48:59,370
He's very serious.

748
00:49:13,829 --> 00:49:14,796
Police!

749
00:49:14,997 --> 00:49:16,055
Don't shoot!

750
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,194
-Don't move.
-Ace him, Jack!

751
00:49:19,401 --> 00:49:20,129
Shut up.

752
00:49:20,336 --> 00:49:21,701
Anxious, aren't you?

753
00:49:21,904 --> 00:49:22,996
Don't kill them.

754
00:49:25,241 --> 00:49:26,765
Back, back, back!

755
00:49:28,010 --> 00:49:29,341
Get off me!

756
00:49:30,579 --> 00:49:32,046
Against the wall!

757
00:49:32,248 --> 00:49:34,079
-Put your hands up!
-Get over there.

758
00:49:35,184 --> 00:49:37,015
Shut up!
Hands behind your back!

759
00:49:38,187 --> 00:49:39,245
So...

760
00:49:39,855 --> 00:49:42,551
...how's it feel
getting out of the office?

761
00:49:48,597 --> 00:49:50,258
This came from forensics.

762
00:49:50,466 --> 00:49:51,899
''Burning clothes.

763
00:49:53,802 --> 00:49:55,235
Casitas Youth Camp....''

764
00:49:58,641 --> 00:50:00,472
lt's crowded in here, White.

765
00:50:01,010 --> 00:50:02,841
These guys killed Stensland.

766
00:50:19,461 --> 00:50:22,259
The ejection marks
on the shells fired from the shotguns...

767
00:50:22,464 --> 00:50:25,558
...are identical to those on the
shell casings found at the Nite Owl.

768
00:50:25,968 --> 00:50:27,902
l want confessions, Edmund.

769
00:50:28,203 --> 00:50:30,194
A night's stewing
has softened them up.

770
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:33,132
l'll break them, sir.

771
00:50:53,329 --> 00:50:56,321
Are you sure golden boy
is up to the task, Cap?

772
00:50:56,999 --> 00:50:59,991
l think you'd be surprised
what the lad is capable of.

773
00:51:02,338 --> 00:51:04,203
You're 22.
Aren't you, Ray?

774
00:51:09,745 --> 00:51:11,508
Did an officer work you over?

775
00:51:13,916 --> 00:51:16,749
-You're 22, right?
-Why do you keep asking that?

776
00:51:17,019 --> 00:51:19,419
22 makes it a gas chamber bounce.

777
00:51:19,855 --> 00:51:22,187
You should've pulled
this caper years ago.

778
00:51:22,424 --> 00:51:25,689
Get life,
do a little Youth Authority jolt...

779
00:51:25,861 --> 00:51:27,692
...transfer to Folsom a big man...

780
00:51:28,097 --> 00:51:29,928
...get yourself a sissy....

781
00:51:30,199 --> 00:51:32,030
l don't truck with no sissies.

782
00:51:35,037 --> 00:51:36,197
Louis.

783
00:51:36,872 --> 00:51:37,770
What?

784
00:51:39,441 --> 00:51:42,001
You did the Casitas Youth Camp
with Louis.

785
00:51:42,211 --> 00:51:46,011
Why you keep asking me about Louis?
His business is his business.

786
00:51:46,215 --> 00:51:49,707
Sugar, Louis told me
you went sissy up at Casitas.

787
00:51:50,052 --> 00:51:53,988
You couldn't do the time, so you got
a big white boy to look after you.

788
00:51:54,223 --> 00:51:55,986
Said they called you ''Sugar''...

789
00:51:56,458 --> 00:51:58,790
...because you gave it out so sweet.

790
00:51:59,628 --> 00:52:03,758
Louis gave it up at Casitas.
l was the boss jock in my dorm!

791
00:52:04,033 --> 00:52:05,125
Louis was the sissy!

792
00:52:05,467 --> 00:52:09,563
Louis gave it up for candy bars!
He ain't got the sense of a dog!

793
00:52:10,639 --> 00:52:12,129
You like to shoot dogs.

794
00:52:12,541 --> 00:52:14,634
Dogs got no reason to live.

795
00:52:16,645 --> 00:52:18,169
Feel the same way about people?

796
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:20,041
What're you trying to say?

797
00:52:20,482 --> 00:52:21,949
We got the shotguns.

798
00:52:22,151 --> 00:52:23,618
l don't own no shotguns.

799
00:52:23,819 --> 00:52:26,219
Why were you throwing clothes
in the incinerator?

800
00:52:26,555 --> 00:52:27,544
Say what?

801
00:52:28,023 --> 00:52:32,483
A neighbor said she saw
you throwing clothes in the incinerator.

802
00:52:32,695 --> 00:52:33,855
Doesn't look good.

803
00:52:34,196 --> 00:52:36,255
l ain't talking till l see a judge.

804
00:52:36,465 --> 00:52:39,992
Were you on hop? You were passed out
when we arrested you.

805
00:52:40,202 --> 00:52:42,762
Ty and Louis fuck with that shit,
not me.

806
00:52:42,971 --> 00:52:44,700
Where do they get their stuff?

807
00:52:46,041 --> 00:52:47,133
Man....

808
00:52:47,643 --> 00:52:50,840
Give me one to feed the D.A.
lt'll make me look good...

809
00:52:51,046 --> 00:52:54,743
...and l'll say Sugar Ray's not a punk
like his sissy partners.

810
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:03,654
Tell me one more thing
about Jones and Fontaine.

811
00:53:04,059 --> 00:53:05,321
Where do they get drugs?

812
00:53:08,397 --> 00:53:09,887
Roland Navarette.

813
00:53:11,533 --> 00:53:14,127
He runs a hole-up on Bunker Hill.

814
00:53:14,336 --> 00:53:16,361
And he sells red devils.

815
00:53:17,172 --> 00:53:18,867
Exley's good, l'll give him that.

816
00:53:19,074 --> 00:53:20,041
l'll take a break.

817
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:27,071
You know, Ray,
l'm talking about the gas chamber...

818
00:53:28,016 --> 00:53:30,507
...and you haven't asked me
what this is about.

819
00:53:31,186 --> 00:53:33,848
You got a big ''guilty'' sign
around your neck.

820
00:53:38,594 --> 00:53:40,357
That was masterful, Edmund.

821
00:53:40,763 --> 00:53:41,752
He's ready to go.

822
00:53:49,605 --> 00:53:52,233
Give Jones the newspaper.
l want him primed.

823
00:53:52,441 --> 00:53:54,773
Take the cuffs off, so he can read it.

824
00:53:55,277 --> 00:53:59,008
Ray Collins just ratted you off.
Said the Nite Owl was your idea.

825
00:53:59,348 --> 00:54:03,614
l think it was Ray's idea.
You talk, l think l can save your life.

826
00:54:04,453 --> 00:54:07,320
6 people are dead,
and someone has to pay for it.

827
00:54:07,523 --> 00:54:10,458
Now, it can be you,
or it can be Ray.

828
00:54:12,628 --> 00:54:14,459
Louis, he called you queer.

829
00:54:14,797 --> 00:54:18,631
-At Casitas, you took it up the ass.
-l didn't kill nobody! !

830
00:54:20,969 --> 00:54:22,129
Son...

831
00:54:23,972 --> 00:54:26,566
...you know what'll happen
if you don't talk.

832
00:54:26,809 --> 00:54:29,744
You'll go to the gas chamber.
So admit what you did.

833
00:54:30,879 --> 00:54:32,608
l didn't mean to hurt her.

834
00:54:32,815 --> 00:54:35,648
-Maybe she's okay.
-Okay?

835
00:54:36,819 --> 00:54:40,255
They're all in the morgue.
They were dead when you left them.

836
00:54:40,422 --> 00:54:44,984
l just wanted to lose my cherry.
She don't die, so l don't die.

837
00:54:45,327 --> 00:54:47,887
She don't die, so l don't die.

838
00:54:48,096 --> 00:54:50,758
Louis, who's the girl?
What's her name?

839
00:54:51,266 --> 00:54:52,927
Who are you talking about?

840
00:54:53,502 --> 00:54:55,265
Was she at the Nite Owl?

841
00:54:55,838 --> 00:54:58,170
Listen to me, was she at the Nite Owl?

842
00:55:05,514 --> 00:55:08,005
-This paper shit ain't shit!
-Where's the girl?

843
00:55:08,183 --> 00:55:09,013
You kill her?

844
00:55:09,952 --> 00:55:14,582
Louis lost his cherry, but things
got out of hand. You made her bleed.

845
00:55:14,790 --> 00:55:17,088
She bled on your clothes,
so you burned the clothes.

846
00:55:17,292 --> 00:55:18,122
Who said that?!

847
00:55:19,528 --> 00:55:20,995
Now, listen to me.

848
00:55:21,196 --> 00:55:23,756
lf she's alive,
she's the only chance you've got.

849
00:55:23,966 --> 00:55:25,194
-l think she's alive.
-You think?

850
00:55:25,701 --> 00:55:27,168
Where is she now?

851
00:55:27,369 --> 00:55:29,132
Did you leave her someplace?

852
00:55:30,706 --> 00:55:32,196
Where is she?

853
00:55:34,309 --> 00:55:35,207
What're you doing?!

854
00:55:36,144 --> 00:55:37,475
Don't.

855
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:39,378
White!

856
00:55:40,716 --> 00:55:41,648
1 in 6!

857
00:55:41,884 --> 00:55:42,782
Where's the girl?!

858
00:55:42,985 --> 00:55:44,509
Put the weapon down!

859
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,210
Where's the girl?! !

860
00:55:54,563 --> 00:55:57,896
Sylvester Fitch, 109 Avalon...

861
00:55:58,667 --> 00:56:01,227
...brown corner house, upstairs.

862
00:56:13,682 --> 00:56:15,912
-Just give me one minute.
-You got it.

863
00:56:22,090 --> 00:56:23,580
Nobody moves.

864
00:56:23,926 --> 00:56:25,587
We're going in the front.

865
00:56:26,094 --> 00:56:27,857
Stay put until l give the word.

866
00:58:53,241 --> 00:58:55,072
He went around back!

867
00:58:56,578 --> 00:58:57,545
l'm Lieutenant Exley.

868
00:58:57,746 --> 00:59:00,715
l'm sorry to ask you this.
l need to know when they left you.

869
00:59:00,916 --> 00:59:03,350
Get her to the hospital.
Excuse me.

870
00:59:03,852 --> 00:59:05,251
Give your career a rest.

871
00:59:05,754 --> 00:59:07,051
Leave her alone.

872
00:59:07,255 --> 00:59:09,883
A naked guy with a gun?
Who'll believe that?

873
00:59:10,092 --> 00:59:11,923
Get the fuck away from me.

874
00:59:12,427 --> 00:59:13,655
How'll it look in your report?

875
00:59:13,862 --> 00:59:17,025
lt'll look like justice.
That's what the man got.

876
00:59:17,265 --> 00:59:18,493
Justice.

877
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:20,361
You don't know the meaning of the word.

878
00:59:21,103 --> 00:59:24,402
You think it means
getting your picture in the paper.

879
00:59:24,606 --> 00:59:26,836
Go after criminals for a change.

880
00:59:27,042 --> 00:59:29,203
Stensland got what he deserved
and so will you.

881
00:59:44,126 --> 00:59:46,219
lt's best to stay away
when his blood is up.

882
00:59:46,461 --> 00:59:47,951
His blood's always up.

883
00:59:49,464 --> 00:59:51,557
Perhaps you should
stay away from him altogether.

884
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,767
Raymond Collins, Ty Jones
and Louis Fontaine.

885
00:59:55,971 --> 00:59:58,701
They are considered armed and dangerous.

886
00:59:58,907 --> 01:00:01,569
Repeat.
The Nite Owl suspects have escaped.

887
01:00:01,977 --> 01:00:03,877
How'd they get out the window?

888
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:05,944
They jumped from the 2nd floor.

889
01:00:06,148 --> 01:00:10,312
Girl said they left her at 12.
They could get to the Nite Owl by 1.

890
01:00:11,319 --> 01:00:14,482
The question was,
where did they get their drugs?

891
01:00:14,990 --> 01:00:17,083
l haven't gotten that far yet.

892
01:00:17,325 --> 01:00:20,920
''Roland Navarette
lives on Bunker Hill, runs a hole-up--''

893
01:00:23,265 --> 01:00:24,596
Anyone seen Jack Vincennes?

894
01:00:26,668 --> 01:00:28,295
ls something up?

895
01:00:28,503 --> 01:00:30,368
l need some backup.

896
01:00:47,622 --> 01:00:49,852
-What?
-Nothing. Let's go.

897
01:00:58,366 --> 01:00:59,799
This should be it.

898
01:01:04,372 --> 01:01:05,304
404.

899
01:01:26,995 --> 01:01:27,984
Nobody moves!

900
01:01:29,664 --> 01:01:30,790
You're under arrest.

901
01:01:30,999 --> 01:01:32,330
Don't shoot, man!

902
01:01:33,168 --> 01:01:34,829
Don't move! Don't move!

903
01:02:27,455 --> 01:02:28,217
There he is.

904
01:02:29,391 --> 01:02:30,756
You did good, kid.

905
01:02:30,959 --> 01:02:34,224
You should've seen this place.
Blood everywhere.

906
01:02:34,796 --> 01:02:37,287
Who would have thought?
Shotgun Ed.

907
01:02:38,133 --> 01:02:39,794
Somebody get him cleaned up.

908
01:02:40,068 --> 01:02:41,057
Come on.

909
01:02:44,306 --> 01:02:48,265
Edmund J. Exley
has amassed a brilliant record...

910
01:02:48,476 --> 01:02:50,944
...in his 7 years
with the Los Angeles Police Department.

911
01:02:51,146 --> 01:02:54,274
Recently, he evinced spectacular bravery
in the line of duty.

912
01:02:54,482 --> 01:02:57,315
lt is our privilege to present him
with our highest honor:

913
01:02:57,652 --> 01:02:59,381
The Medal of Valor.

914
01:02:59,587 --> 01:03:01,885
-What kind of car was it?
-lt was a Ford.

915
01:03:02,090 --> 01:03:04,820
My husband always drove a Ford.
l know what they look like.

916
01:03:05,493 --> 01:03:08,223
Excuse me, ma'am.
Just the facts. Light or dark?

917
01:03:08,430 --> 01:03:12,264
Light. And that's really
all l remember, Officer.

918
01:03:13,168 --> 01:03:15,159
Thank you.
You've been a big help.

919
01:03:15,670 --> 01:03:17,399
Cut!
That's a print.

920
01:03:17,605 --> 01:03:19,004
Big Jack!

921
01:03:19,607 --> 01:03:20,631
He's back!

922
01:03:20,842 --> 01:03:22,833
Jack's back.

923
01:03:55,977 --> 01:03:59,538
Tell Mr. Patchett
l have no intention of changing my vote.

924
01:04:11,159 --> 01:04:15,994
lt may surprise some that an official
would admit to making a mistake...

925
01:04:16,831 --> 01:04:19,231
...but after due consideration...

926
01:04:19,834 --> 01:04:23,065
...l am changing my position
on the matter before the council.

927
01:04:24,906 --> 01:04:28,205
''Go west, America,''
was a slogan of Manifest Destiny.

928
01:04:28,410 --> 01:04:32,141
Today is that last step westward
with no stop signs...

929
01:04:32,347 --> 01:04:34,645
...no traffic signals, from downtown...

930
01:04:34,849 --> 01:04:36,908
...to the beach in 20 minutes.

931
01:05:07,782 --> 01:05:09,773
What were you going to start with?

932
01:05:12,053 --> 01:05:13,543
Prostitution?

933
01:05:15,290 --> 01:05:16,621
Gambling?

934
01:05:19,961 --> 01:05:24,125
Go back to Jersey, sonny.
This is the City of the Angels...

935
01:05:24,299 --> 01:05:26,460
...and you haven't got any wings.

936
01:05:49,324 --> 01:05:51,656
Nice to see you again.
Take care.

937
01:06:28,897 --> 01:06:32,196
l wondered when you'd
knock on my door again, Officer White.

938
01:06:32,867 --> 01:06:34,027
lt's Bud.

939
01:06:35,637 --> 01:06:36,797
Bud.

940
01:07:06,167 --> 01:07:07,225
Why me?

941
01:07:09,337 --> 01:07:10,565
l don't know.

942
01:07:47,208 --> 01:07:48,436
This election...

943
01:07:48,643 --> 01:07:51,908
...is about the future
of law enforcement in Los Angeles.

944
01:07:52,113 --> 01:07:55,207
City Councilman Rogers
represents that future.

945
01:07:55,550 --> 01:07:57,245
So let's dig deep...

946
01:07:57,452 --> 01:08:01,218
...and get a moral man re-elected.
Ellis Loew wants to say a few words.

947
01:08:05,293 --> 01:08:08,387
Thank you, Brett Chase.
The talented star of Badge of Honor.

948
01:08:10,732 --> 01:08:13,428
Let me tell you,
l am so thrilled to be here.

949
01:08:15,069 --> 01:08:16,229
Big V.

950
01:08:18,573 --> 01:08:20,268
Good to see you back.

951
01:08:20,475 --> 01:08:23,239
-How they hanging, Sid?
-Down around my ankles.

952
01:08:23,478 --> 01:08:25,378
You tight with the D.A., Jackie?

953
01:08:25,580 --> 01:08:26,444
Yeah.

954
01:08:26,648 --> 01:08:29,116
He tried to throw me off the force
last Christmas.

955
01:08:29,317 --> 01:08:30,944
How about some payback, big-time?

956
01:08:31,152 --> 01:08:35,816
Plus the usual 50 dollar donation
to the Jack Vincennes retirement fund.

957
01:08:36,391 --> 01:08:39,485
-Did you know the D.A. was a swish?
-No kidding?

958
01:08:42,096 --> 01:08:45,224
Remember Matt Reynolds? Christmas Eve?
''The Movie Premiere Pot Bust''?

959
01:08:45,433 --> 01:08:48,095
-He just got off the honor farm.
-What's he doing here?

960
01:08:48,936 --> 01:08:51,461
Reynolds is acey-deucey,
not to mention broke.

961
01:08:51,673 --> 01:08:54,073
l'm getting him
to fuck the D.A. for $100.

962
01:08:54,275 --> 01:08:57,176
That's twice the $50
you got for wrecking his career.

963
01:08:58,846 --> 01:09:01,440
-Come here, come here.
-Jesus, don't bring him--

964
01:09:06,354 --> 01:09:08,015
That's D.A. Loew right there.

965
01:09:13,294 --> 01:09:14,625
You need a drink?

966
01:09:15,463 --> 01:09:16,521
Yeah.

967
01:09:17,632 --> 01:09:18,826
Look after him.

968
01:09:19,033 --> 01:09:22,867
Matt, this is Jack.
No secrets between me and him.

969
01:09:28,142 --> 01:09:30,542
-How you doing?
-l'm okay. How're you?

970
01:09:30,712 --> 01:09:31,974
l'm good.

971
01:09:34,982 --> 01:09:36,813
Have we met before?

972
01:09:39,153 --> 01:09:40,313
Yeah.

973
01:09:41,389 --> 01:09:42,720
Was it at a party?

974
01:09:43,057 --> 01:09:44,888
lt was something like that.

975
01:09:46,494 --> 01:09:48,086
Fleur-de-Lis party, right?

976
01:09:49,397 --> 01:09:50,557
Right.

977
01:09:51,232 --> 01:09:52,722
Fleur-de-Lis.

978
01:09:53,334 --> 01:09:55,325
''Whatever you desire.''

979
01:09:55,570 --> 01:09:58,232
Dope, hookers that
look like movie stars....

980
01:09:58,673 --> 01:10:00,573
Pierce Patchett has it all.

981
01:10:01,509 --> 01:10:03,374
You could say that again.

982
01:10:03,578 --> 01:10:06,172
Pierce, he's not like regular guys.

983
01:10:07,849 --> 01:10:09,180
l dig him, but...

984
01:10:10,685 --> 01:10:11,674
...you know...

985
01:10:12,754 --> 01:10:14,244
...he scares me too.

986
01:10:15,022 --> 01:10:16,011
Really?

987
01:10:16,691 --> 01:10:17,589
How?

988
01:10:18,693 --> 01:10:23,596
When l came out to L.A. this isn't
exactly where l saw myself ending up.

989
01:10:24,932 --> 01:10:26,160
Yeah, well...

990
01:10:26,367 --> 01:10:27,595
...get in line.

991
01:10:28,102 --> 01:10:30,195
Your courage, kid. Drink up.

992
01:10:35,443 --> 01:10:37,172
l don't think l should do this.

993
01:10:37,712 --> 01:10:39,703
lt's not like you don't know how.

994
01:10:40,047 --> 01:10:44,746
Jack's connected to Badge of Honor.
Pull this off, you'll get a part.

995
01:10:44,952 --> 01:10:47,819
l smell a comeback, don't you, Jack?

996
01:10:50,458 --> 01:10:51,720
The D.A.'s free.

997
01:10:51,959 --> 01:10:54,553
Go introduce yourself. Go on.

998
01:10:54,896 --> 01:10:57,558
Tell him about the opening on the show.

999
01:10:58,733 --> 01:11:01,065
l'm pretty sure l can get you
a part on this show.

1000
01:11:01,302 --> 01:11:02,530
But...

1001
01:11:02,737 --> 01:11:04,102
...that's later on.

1002
01:11:04,305 --> 01:11:07,900
Tonight, go on over there
and pretend it's an acting job.

1003
01:11:08,242 --> 01:11:09,709
Like show biz.

1004
01:11:09,911 --> 01:11:11,105
Acting, that's it.

1005
01:11:11,312 --> 01:11:12,244
Right.

1006
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:14,175
No one's going to know about this?

1007
01:11:14,382 --> 01:11:15,212
No.

1008
01:11:17,418 --> 01:11:19,079
lt'll be our secret.

1009
01:11:23,758 --> 01:11:26,249
-Show biz.
-That's it. Go on.

1010
01:11:29,764 --> 01:11:31,493
Show biz.

1011
01:11:33,434 --> 01:11:35,766
lf Reynolds works his charms,
which l know he will...

1012
01:11:35,970 --> 01:11:38,803
...they'll be at the
Hollywood Center Motel, room 203.

1013
01:11:39,006 --> 01:11:41,099
Meet me there at midnight
for a photo shoot.

1014
01:11:42,276 --> 01:11:45,439
And maybe we can work in
the Hollywood sign this time.

1015
01:11:46,647 --> 01:11:48,342
What do you know
about Pierce Patchett?

1016
01:11:50,117 --> 01:11:51,812
l know what you know.

1017
01:11:52,019 --> 01:11:56,353
He's rich. lnvested in the freeways,
which'll make him richer. Why?

1018
01:11:57,692 --> 01:11:59,819
l just keep hearing rumors, you know.

1019
01:11:59,961 --> 01:12:03,294
High-class porn, drugs,
hookers that look like movie stars.

1020
01:12:04,398 --> 01:12:07,731
Patchett's what l call twilight.
He ain't queer or Red.

1021
01:12:08,135 --> 01:12:11,969
He cannot help me
in my quest for prime sinnuendo.

1022
01:12:17,578 --> 01:12:21,708
As though Badge of Honor would
touch that guy with a 10-foot pole...

1023
01:12:21,916 --> 01:12:25,044
...after he's been Hush-Hush
cover boy twice in one year.

1024
01:12:25,253 --> 01:12:26,481
See you soon.

1025
01:12:26,754 --> 01:12:30,747
Midnight. l guarantee all kinds
of illegal activity.

1026
01:13:03,958 --> 01:13:04,822
Another?

1027
01:13:05,026 --> 01:13:05,958
Yeah.

1028
01:13:50,504 --> 01:13:51,493
Kid?

1029
01:13:59,513 --> 01:14:02,073
Come on, you don't have to do this--

1030
01:14:33,781 --> 01:14:35,942
Thank you for what you did for me...

1031
01:14:36,450 --> 01:14:39,044
...for killing those animals
who raped me.

1032
01:14:39,387 --> 01:14:42,117
Will you thank Officer White
for me, please?

1033
01:14:42,390 --> 01:14:43,448
Sure.

1034
01:14:44,959 --> 01:14:48,918
Seeing him come through the door
is about the only thing l remember.

1035
01:14:49,130 --> 01:14:50,290
Thank God.

1036
01:14:51,298 --> 01:14:54,062
You remember what time
the Negroes left you, right?

1037
01:14:54,402 --> 01:14:57,599
ln your statement, you said
they left you at midnight.

1038
01:14:57,805 --> 01:14:58,897
They might have.

1039
01:15:04,478 --> 01:15:05,775
They ''might'' have?

1040
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:09,743
l don't know what time they left me.
l wanted them dead.

1041
01:15:10,084 --> 01:15:13,520
Would anyone care
that they raped a Mexican girl...

1042
01:15:13,754 --> 01:15:16,814
...if they hadn't killed
those white people at the Nite Owl?

1043
01:15:17,758 --> 01:15:19,988
l did what l had to do for justice.

1044
01:15:20,928 --> 01:15:22,225
Exley, over here.

1045
01:15:22,430 --> 01:15:23,590
Smile, lnez.

1046
01:15:25,266 --> 01:15:26,995
ls he your hero?

1047
01:15:27,668 --> 01:15:32,105
Fellas, how about this? ''Rape Victim
Wheeled Out by Nite Owl Hero.''

1048
01:15:37,778 --> 01:15:40,008
All they get is Veronica Lake.

1049
01:15:42,183 --> 01:15:44,515
l get Lynn Margaret Bracken.

1050
01:15:55,629 --> 01:15:56,653
''Bisbee?''

1051
01:15:58,966 --> 01:16:00,524
l grew up there.

1052
01:16:02,636 --> 01:16:07,130
l'm going back in a couple of years,
open up a dress shop.

1053
01:16:09,143 --> 01:16:12,374
The girls in Bisbee
need a little glamour.

1054
01:16:17,885 --> 01:16:19,546
Where'd this come from?

1055
01:16:21,222 --> 01:16:25,215
l was 12. My dad went after my mother
with a bottle. l got in the way.

1056
01:16:27,228 --> 01:16:28,820
So you saved her.

1057
01:16:30,231 --> 01:16:31,562
Not for long.

1058
01:16:34,668 --> 01:16:37,899
-l'm sorry. lt's none of my business.
-He tied me to the radiator.

1059
01:16:38,739 --> 01:16:41,902
l watched him beat my mother to death
with a tire iron...

1060
01:16:44,345 --> 01:16:45,835
...and he left me there.

1061
01:16:48,415 --> 01:16:51,407
Three days before
a truant officer found us.

1062
01:16:54,522 --> 01:16:56,422
They never found the old man.

1063
01:17:05,766 --> 01:17:07,757
ls that why you became a cop?

1064
01:17:08,536 --> 01:17:09,935
To get even?

1065
01:17:11,539 --> 01:17:12,699
Maybe.

1066
01:17:14,608 --> 01:17:16,041
Do you like it?

1067
01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:20,779
l used to.

1068
01:17:22,783 --> 01:17:25,616
Now it's all strong-arm,
sitting duck stuff.

1069
01:17:26,620 --> 01:17:27,951
lf l could...

1070
01:17:29,223 --> 01:17:31,714
...get a chance to work Homicide...

1071
01:17:32,126 --> 01:17:33,218
...like a real detective....

1072
01:17:35,396 --> 01:17:37,956
That prick, Exley,
he shot the wrong guys.

1073
01:17:38,799 --> 01:17:43,463
Whoever killed Stensland's still around.
l know it in here. l know it.

1074
01:17:44,071 --> 01:17:45,902
Something's wrong
with the Nite Owl.

1075
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:48,401
l just can't prove it, that's all.

1076
01:17:49,643 --> 01:17:51,577
l'm not smart enough.

1077
01:17:53,581 --> 01:17:56,744
l'm just the guy they bring in
to scare the other guy shitless.

1078
01:18:00,154 --> 01:18:01,587
You're wrong.

1079
01:18:02,423 --> 01:18:04,983
You found Patchett. You found me.

1080
01:18:05,359 --> 01:18:07,156
You're smart enough.

1081
01:18:18,839 --> 01:18:21,831
Bud White! What brings you down
to the basement?

1082
01:18:25,679 --> 01:18:27,647
l got a couple of Nite Owl questions.

1083
01:18:27,848 --> 01:18:30,942
Don't know if you read the papers,
but that case is closed.

1084
01:18:32,953 --> 01:18:34,716
Anything bother you about it?

1085
01:18:35,522 --> 01:18:39,185
The fact that the pack-up boys haven't
hauled this shit out of here yet.

1086
01:18:43,864 --> 01:18:47,857
The suspects' 3 shotguns match
the strike marks on the shell casings.

1087
01:18:48,969 --> 01:18:50,800
What more do you want?

1088
01:19:02,549 --> 01:19:04,380
There's blood on the wall here.

1089
01:19:05,052 --> 01:19:07,520
l thought everyone got shot
in the men's room.

1090
01:19:07,721 --> 01:19:10,155
That is Stensland's blood.

1091
01:19:12,226 --> 01:19:16,060
Blow to the head. Probably unconscious
when they dragged him in the john.

1092
01:19:17,731 --> 01:19:19,028
Did they hit anyone else?

1093
01:19:19,233 --> 01:19:22,600
No, but he was a cop.
Probably tried to do something.

1094
01:19:26,407 --> 01:19:30,070
Grilled cheese, black coffee.
Someone was sitting next to him.

1095
01:19:34,081 --> 01:19:35,844
2 victims were women?

1096
01:19:36,083 --> 01:19:40,076
Yeah, Patti DeLuca, the night shift
waitress, and a Susan Lefferts.

1097
01:19:44,758 --> 01:19:46,521
Susan Lefferts.

1098
01:19:48,195 --> 01:19:49,685
Yeah, what about her?

1099
01:19:52,766 --> 01:19:54,199
You're welcome!

1100
01:20:00,207 --> 01:20:01,572
Mrs. Lefferts?

1101
01:20:01,775 --> 01:20:03,709
l'm Officer White, LAPD.

1102
01:20:06,547 --> 01:20:09,914
Tell me about the boyfriend
you mentioned at the coroner's office.

1103
01:20:10,117 --> 01:20:12,449
l told you l didn't
approve of that boyfriend.

1104
01:20:13,053 --> 01:20:17,456
He was too old for you.
And you let him be fresh with me.

1105
01:20:19,226 --> 01:20:21,626
They came here one day
when l wasn't home.

1106
01:20:22,062 --> 01:20:23,927
Mrs. Jensen next door said...

1107
01:20:24,131 --> 01:20:27,692
...she saw Susie's boyfriend
and another man and...

1108
01:20:27,901 --> 01:20:29,732
...she heard a ruckus.

1109
01:20:30,404 --> 01:20:31,462
What was his name?

1110
01:20:31,805 --> 01:20:34,467
We weren't properly introduced.

1111
01:20:35,075 --> 01:20:37,373
Susie gave him a nickname,
Muns or Luns.

1112
01:20:37,578 --> 01:20:38,806
Stens?

1113
01:20:39,146 --> 01:20:40,113
Was it Stens?

1114
01:20:40,314 --> 01:20:41,611
Maybe.

1115
01:20:41,815 --> 01:20:42,782
l don't know.

1116
01:20:42,983 --> 01:20:43,813
Look.

1117
01:20:47,654 --> 01:20:48,814
That's him.

1118
01:20:49,156 --> 01:20:50,248
That's him.

1119
01:20:55,496 --> 01:20:57,828
You said a neighbor heard a ruckus.

1120
01:20:58,432 --> 01:20:59,296
Was it outside?

1121
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:00,660
lnside?

1122
01:21:01,835 --> 01:21:03,097
Outside.

1123
01:21:03,337 --> 01:21:07,330
And then Mrs. Jensen said
they kept going under the house.

1124
01:21:12,146 --> 01:21:13,773
You have to leave now, officer.

1125
01:21:15,015 --> 01:21:18,451
-What's through here?
-Just a room full of old things.

1126
01:21:18,685 --> 01:21:20,619
Don't move that!

1127
01:21:23,023 --> 01:21:26,686
Don't mind the smell.
l think a rat died behind the wall.

1128
01:21:27,961 --> 01:21:29,360
My Susie was a good girl.

1129
01:21:30,130 --> 01:21:33,293
She was never
in any kind of trouble at all!

1130
01:22:44,538 --> 01:22:47,006
''Leland Meeks.''
Never heard of you.

1131
01:22:47,207 --> 01:22:48,765
They call me Buzz.

1132
01:22:55,782 --> 01:22:57,044
Was it a rat?

1133
01:22:57,885 --> 01:22:59,785
Yeah, a great big one.

1134
01:23:02,055 --> 01:23:03,044
Here.

1135
01:23:04,057 --> 01:23:05,957
Compliments of the Police Department.

1136
01:23:23,076 --> 01:23:26,204
Stomach of the week
from a motel homicide.

1137
01:23:26,413 --> 01:23:29,780
Unemployed actor had frankfurter,
french fries, alcohol and sperm.

1138
01:23:29,983 --> 01:23:32,281
Hell of a last supper, don't you think?

1139
01:23:32,586 --> 01:23:35,521
Anything bothering you
about the Nite Owl case?

1140
01:23:36,123 --> 01:23:38,091
That you guys
won't let it get filed away.

1141
01:23:39,259 --> 01:23:42,922
-What do you mean?
-Bud White grilled me on it today.

1142
01:23:43,997 --> 01:23:45,259
Bud White?

1143
01:23:45,866 --> 01:23:47,925
He's not as dumb as l thought.

1144
01:23:50,170 --> 01:23:52,934
Did he say where he was going
after he talked to you?

1145
01:24:05,352 --> 01:24:07,183
Let my daughter rest in peace!

1146
01:24:07,387 --> 01:24:09,514
Mrs. Lefferts,
l want to ask a few questions.

1147
01:24:09,723 --> 01:24:12,157
Officer White already checked
under the house.

1148
01:24:12,726 --> 01:24:13,818
Under the house?

1149
01:24:14,561 --> 01:24:16,893
-Where?
-Out back.

1150
01:24:18,332 --> 01:24:19,959
All he found was rodents.

1151
01:24:23,337 --> 01:24:27,239
l need an l.D. on this as soon as
possible. Talk only to me on this one.

1152
01:24:31,244 --> 01:24:32,211
l need your help.

1153
01:24:32,412 --> 01:24:35,848
l'm busy right now. Why don't you ask
your boys in Homicide?

1154
01:24:38,752 --> 01:24:41,414
l can't. l need someone
outside of Homicide.

1155
01:24:42,189 --> 01:24:44,919
Tail Bud White until he goes
on duty this evening.

1156
01:24:46,426 --> 01:24:48,690
Do me a real favor and leave me alone.

1157
01:24:49,796 --> 01:24:52,094
You make the Negroes
for the Nite Owl killings?

1158
01:24:55,435 --> 01:24:56,265
What?

1159
01:24:56,603 --> 01:24:58,002
lt's a simple question.

1160
01:25:00,107 --> 01:25:03,008
Why in the world
do you want to dig deeper...

1161
01:25:03,210 --> 01:25:05,178
...into the Nite Owl killings...

1162
01:25:05,379 --> 01:25:06,607
...Lieutenant?

1163
01:25:10,384 --> 01:25:11,874
Rollo Tomasi.

1164
01:25:13,954 --> 01:25:15,945
ls there more or do l have to guess?

1165
01:25:19,126 --> 01:25:21,287
Rollo was a purse snatcher.

1166
01:25:25,732 --> 01:25:27,791
My father ran into him off-duty.

1167
01:25:29,803 --> 01:25:32,897
He shot my father 6 times
and got away clean.

1168
01:25:34,408 --> 01:25:36,137
No one knew who he was.

1169
01:25:36,977 --> 01:25:39,070
l made the name up to give
him personality.

1170
01:25:40,914 --> 01:25:41,972
What's your point?

1171
01:25:42,649 --> 01:25:45,413
Rollo Tomasi's the reason
l became a cop.

1172
01:25:46,153 --> 01:25:49,680
l wanted to catch the guys
who thought they could get away with it.

1173
01:25:51,124 --> 01:25:52,921
lt was supposed to be about justice.

1174
01:25:53,927 --> 01:25:56,919
Then somewhere along the way
l lost sight of that.

1175
01:26:01,101 --> 01:26:02,295
Why'd you become a cop?

1176
01:26:12,946 --> 01:26:14,675
l don't remember.

1177
01:26:21,365 --> 01:26:22,730
What do you want, Exley?

1178
01:26:23,367 --> 01:26:25,028
l want to solve this thing.

1179
01:26:25,636 --> 01:26:27,365
Nite Owl was solved.

1180
01:26:27,871 --> 01:26:28,963
No.

1181
01:26:30,207 --> 01:26:31,504
l want to do it right.

1182
01:26:32,209 --> 01:26:34,575
Even if it means
paying the consequences?

1183
01:26:38,048 --> 01:26:39,913
All right, college boy, l'll help.

1184
01:26:40,317 --> 01:26:43,115
But there's a case your boys
in Homicide don't care about.

1185
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:47,256
They think it's just another
Hollywood ''homo''-cide. But l don't.

1186
01:26:48,158 --> 01:26:51,389
You help me with mine,
l'll help you with yours.

1187
01:26:51,829 --> 01:26:52,693
Deal?

1188
01:26:53,831 --> 01:26:54,627
Deal.

1189
01:27:27,131 --> 01:27:29,224
Johnny Stompanato.

1190
01:27:30,401 --> 01:27:33,268
Officer Wendell White.
How's tricks, paesano?

1191
01:27:33,470 --> 01:27:35,131
l ain't your paesano.

1192
01:27:35,906 --> 01:27:37,999
l ain't in the snitch business anymore.

1193
01:27:38,308 --> 01:27:40,469
You know a guy named Buzz Meeks?

1194
01:27:41,578 --> 01:27:43,409
Works for Pierce Patchett.

1195
01:27:43,981 --> 01:27:45,141
Should l?

1196
01:27:46,583 --> 01:27:49,450
You're muscle for hire.
Meeks is muscle for hire.

1197
01:27:49,653 --> 01:27:50,984
You tell me.

1198
01:27:52,923 --> 01:27:54,891
Yeah, l remember now.

1199
01:27:55,092 --> 01:27:58,721
Meeks is a run-down ex-cop.
Same as you're going to be some day.

1200
01:27:58,929 --> 01:28:00,396
That's all you'll get.

1201
01:28:01,265 --> 01:28:03,096
Keep your 20 bucks.

1202
01:28:08,605 --> 01:28:12,006
What do l get if l give you
your balls back, you wop cocksucker?

1203
01:28:16,346 --> 01:28:18,746
There was a rumor going around...

1204
01:28:18,949 --> 01:28:22,043
...that Meeks had a line
on a large supply of H.

1205
01:28:24,121 --> 01:28:24,951
And?

1206
01:28:25,722 --> 01:28:27,189
And nothing!

1207
01:28:27,391 --> 01:28:29,052
He skipped out.

1208
01:28:41,472 --> 01:28:42,632
Bullshit.

1209
01:28:43,574 --> 01:28:46,737
How would Meeks get his hands
on a large supply of heroin?

1210
01:28:47,578 --> 01:28:48,772
You're right.

1211
01:28:48,979 --> 01:28:50,913
lt's probably bullshit.

1212
01:28:51,148 --> 01:28:53,639
Even if he did,
he could never unload it.

1213
01:28:53,917 --> 01:28:56,408
Not without drawing
all kinds of attention.

1214
01:28:56,987 --> 01:29:00,980
Maybe that's why he's under a house
in Elysian Park not smelling too good...

1215
01:29:02,493 --> 01:29:03,824
...paesano.

1216
01:29:56,246 --> 01:29:58,771
Maybe White's
not so dumb after all.

1217
01:30:11,995 --> 01:30:15,988
We got Rita Hayworth at the morgue,
and now Veronica Lake with White.

1218
01:30:16,567 --> 01:30:20,901
l think your case and my case
are connected. lt's Fleur-de-Lis again.

1219
01:30:21,071 --> 01:30:22,231
Fleur-de-Lis?

1220
01:30:23,240 --> 01:30:24,867
''Whatever you desire.''

1221
01:30:25,075 --> 01:30:26,167
Porno.

1222
01:30:26,510 --> 01:30:29,377
High-class whores
cut to look like movie stars.

1223
01:30:29,580 --> 01:30:33,209
Who knows what else. Reynolds,
the kid that got killed, was involved.

1224
01:30:33,417 --> 01:30:35,044
So is Pierce Patchett.

1225
01:30:35,252 --> 01:30:36,514
The millionaire?

1226
01:30:37,020 --> 01:30:39,011
l think we should go talk to him.

1227
01:30:39,856 --> 01:30:41,847
First l want to brace Stompanato.

1228
01:30:58,141 --> 01:31:00,609
Want an autograph?
Write to MGM.

1229
01:31:01,445 --> 01:31:04,710
Since when do two-bit hoods
and hookers give out autographs?

1230
01:31:05,115 --> 01:31:06,173
What?

1231
01:31:06,383 --> 01:31:07,680
LAPD. Sit down.

1232
01:31:07,884 --> 01:31:10,011
Who in the hell do you think you are?

1233
01:31:10,220 --> 01:31:11,778
Take a walk, honey.

1234
01:31:12,122 --> 01:31:15,353
-You are making a large mistake.
-Get away from our table.

1235
01:31:15,559 --> 01:31:16,548
Shut up.

1236
01:31:18,061 --> 01:31:20,291
A hooker cut to look like Lana Turner
is still a hooker.

1237
01:31:21,465 --> 01:31:23,956
-She just looks like Lana Turner.
-She is Lana Turner.

1238
01:31:25,469 --> 01:31:27,300
She is Lana Turner.

1239
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:38,311
How was l supposed to know?

1240
01:31:54,498 --> 01:31:58,298
l believe the Nite Owl's
your area of expertise, Mr. Exley.

1241
01:31:58,568 --> 01:32:01,162
l saw you on television
getting your medal.

1242
01:32:02,673 --> 01:32:03,935
And you're...

1243
01:32:04,341 --> 01:32:08,175
...that other Hollywood
celebrity policeman, aren't you?

1244
01:32:09,146 --> 01:32:13,105
The Veronica Lake look-alike works
for you. She's one of your whores.

1245
01:32:14,451 --> 01:32:16,078
A vulgar term.

1246
01:32:16,286 --> 01:32:17,617
Why's she seeing Bud White?

1247
01:32:17,954 --> 01:32:21,617
Why do men and women
usually see each other?

1248
01:32:24,528 --> 01:32:27,190
Let's try this on for size:
Fleur-de-Lis.

1249
01:32:27,698 --> 01:32:29,461
''Whatever you desire.''

1250
01:32:30,133 --> 01:32:31,691
An actor named...

1251
01:32:32,135 --> 01:32:33,033
...Matt Reynolds.

1252
01:32:34,805 --> 01:32:35,794
No? Nothing?

1253
01:32:38,975 --> 01:32:40,806
We want some answers.

1254
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:45,380
We all want something.

1255
01:32:47,718 --> 01:32:49,652
The guy's as cool as they come.

1256
01:32:52,222 --> 01:32:55,055
Lieutenant Exley,
come in, please. Over.

1257
01:32:56,226 --> 01:32:57,022
Exley.

1258
01:32:57,227 --> 01:33:00,162
The coroner wants to talk to you.
He says he has your l.D.

1259
01:33:00,731 --> 01:33:03,666
Tell him Sergeant Vincennes
is coming in to talk to him.

1260
01:33:03,900 --> 01:33:06,130
-l'll drop you at your car.
-Where are you going?

1261
01:33:06,336 --> 01:33:07,735
Lynn Bracken's.

1262
01:33:08,004 --> 01:33:12,668
To find out why Patchett has her seeing
Bud White. See you at the Frolic Room.

1263
01:33:13,343 --> 01:33:16,710
Oh, great. You get the girl.
l get the coroner.

1264
01:33:26,757 --> 01:33:29,749
Hush-Hush, off the record
and on the q.t.

1265
01:33:33,363 --> 01:33:35,991
l was just coming up to see you.
You get that l.D.?

1266
01:33:36,199 --> 01:33:40,659
Thank God for dental records.
Stiff used to be a cop. Leland Meeks.

1267
01:33:40,871 --> 01:33:41,838
Buzz Meeks?

1268
01:33:42,038 --> 01:33:43,403
-You knew him?
-Of him.

1269
01:33:43,607 --> 01:33:47,441
He was around when l joined the force.
Bad rep. Thanks.

1270
01:33:47,878 --> 01:33:49,243
''Just the facts,'' Jack.

1271
01:33:49,446 --> 01:33:51,209
''Just the facts.''

1272
01:33:54,618 --> 01:33:55,676
Anything else?

1273
01:33:55,886 --> 01:33:59,879
Leland Meeks worked Vice '39-'41.
l need to see his arrest records.

1274
01:34:06,963 --> 01:34:08,021
Miss Bracken...

1275
01:34:08,231 --> 01:34:09,596
...l'm Lieutenant Exley.

1276
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:10,892
l know.

1277
01:34:11,301 --> 01:34:13,462
Bud told me all about you.

1278
01:34:13,737 --> 01:34:14,965
ls that so?

1279
01:34:15,972 --> 01:34:17,963
And what did White have to say?

1280
01:34:19,476 --> 01:34:21,410
He said you were smart.

1281
01:34:22,078 --> 01:34:25,912
He also said you were a coward, and that
you'd screw yourself to get ahead.

1282
01:34:26,583 --> 01:34:28,813
Let's concentrate on my smarts.

1283
01:34:29,152 --> 01:34:34,089
Pierce Patchett made you, didn't he?
Taught you how to dress, talk and think.

1284
01:34:35,158 --> 01:34:37,092
l am very impressed with the results.

1285
01:34:38,428 --> 01:34:39,793
But l need answers.

1286
01:34:39,996 --> 01:34:43,090
And if l don't get them,
l'll take you and Patchett down.

1287
01:34:43,767 --> 01:34:46,429
Pierce Patchett
can take care of himself.

1288
01:34:47,504 --> 01:34:49,438
And l'm not afraid of you.

1289
01:34:50,340 --> 01:34:53,002
And you forget one thing, Lieutenant...

1290
01:34:53,343 --> 01:34:55,937
...Pierce also taught me how to fuck.

1291
01:34:59,683 --> 01:35:01,446
And he tells you who to fuck.

1292
01:35:01,952 --> 01:35:03,977
Why does he have you fucking Bud White?

1293
01:35:04,187 --> 01:35:07,350
What makes you think
l'm not seeing Bud because l want to?

1294
01:35:09,025 --> 01:35:12,358
lt would be easier for you
if there was an angle, wouldn't it?

1295
01:35:13,129 --> 01:35:16,189
You're afraid of Bud because you can't
figure out how to play him.

1296
01:35:17,300 --> 01:35:20,531
He doesn't follow
the same rules of politics as you do.

1297
01:35:21,304 --> 01:35:23,101
lt makes him dangerous.

1298
01:35:23,306 --> 01:35:24,534
l can handle Bud White.

1299
01:35:24,808 --> 01:35:25,968
Can you?

1300
01:35:29,980 --> 01:35:32,210
l see Bud because l want to.

1301
01:35:35,719 --> 01:35:39,052
l see Bud because
he can't hide the good inside of him.

1302
01:35:40,891 --> 01:35:43,621
l see Bud because he makes me feel
like Lynn Bracken...

1303
01:35:43,827 --> 01:35:47,228
...and not some Veronica Lake look-alike
who fucks for money.

1304
01:35:49,399 --> 01:35:53,665
l see Bud because he doesn't
know how to disguise who he is.

1305
01:35:55,739 --> 01:35:59,334
l see Bud for all the ways
he's different from you.

1306
01:36:01,745 --> 01:36:03,838
Don't underestimate me.

1307
01:36:04,347 --> 01:36:07,339
The way you've underestimated Bud White?

1308
01:36:13,823 --> 01:36:16,519
Fucking me and fucking Bud
aren't the same thing.

1309
01:36:17,027 --> 01:36:19,018
Stop talking about Bud White.

1310
01:36:43,954 --> 01:36:45,888
Come on.

1311
01:36:48,625 --> 01:36:49,887
Shit.

1312
01:37:03,306 --> 01:37:04,967
Jack Vincennes.

1313
01:37:05,976 --> 01:37:07,637
lt's going on midnight.

1314
01:37:07,978 --> 01:37:09,809
l need 2 minutes, Dudley.

1315
01:37:10,146 --> 01:37:11,306
lt's important.

1316
01:37:11,982 --> 01:37:16,248
Good thing for you my wife and daughters
are at the beach in Santa Barbara.

1317
01:37:19,422 --> 01:37:22,118
Do you remember Buzz Meeks, Dudley?

1318
01:37:22,325 --> 01:37:24,555
A disgrace as a police officer.

1319
01:37:24,761 --> 01:37:28,925
Straight D fitness reports from every
C.O. he ever served under. Why?

1320
01:37:29,666 --> 01:37:32,567
12 years ago, he was on a Vice roust
with Dick Stensland.

1321
01:37:32,769 --> 01:37:36,068
They questioned Pierce Patchett
about a blackmail scam.

1322
01:37:36,272 --> 01:37:40,436
Patchett had Sid Hudgens photographing
prominent businessmen with hookers.

1323
01:37:41,177 --> 01:37:44,146
Anyway, charges were dropped.
lnsufficient evidence.

1324
01:37:44,347 --> 01:37:48,841
You were the supervising officer on
that case. Remember anything about it?

1325
01:37:50,120 --> 01:37:51,610
What's this about, boyo?

1326
01:37:52,455 --> 01:37:56,118
lt has to do with a murder
l've been working with Ed Exley on.

1327
01:37:56,526 --> 01:37:59,154
You're Narco, Jack, not Homicide.

1328
01:37:59,362 --> 01:38:01,523
Since when do you work
with Edmund Exley?

1329
01:38:02,699 --> 01:38:05,065
lt's a private investigation.

1330
01:38:07,137 --> 01:38:09,605
l messed something up.
l'm trying to make amends.

1331
01:38:09,806 --> 01:38:12,206
Don't start trying
to do the right thing, boyo.

1332
01:38:12,709 --> 01:38:13,869
You haven't had the practice.

1333
01:38:21,217 --> 01:38:24,152
Buzz Meeks and Dick Stensland.

1334
01:38:27,323 --> 01:38:29,985
So, what does Exley make of this?

1335
01:38:30,493 --> 01:38:33,758
l haven't told him yet.
l just came from the records room.

1336
01:38:59,522 --> 01:39:01,752
Have you a valediction, boyo?

1337
01:39:08,098 --> 01:39:09,690
Rollo...

1338
01:39:10,767 --> 01:39:12,428
...Tomasi.

1339
01:39:33,289 --> 01:39:36,850
Sergeant Vincennes was killed
by a .32 slug to the heart.

1340
01:39:37,060 --> 01:39:39,460
Time of death, approximately 1 a.m.

1341
01:39:39,996 --> 01:39:44,626
Although he was found in Echo Park,
forensics indicates the body was moved.

1342
01:39:46,302 --> 01:39:49,635
l want 2-man teams
to scour that entire neighborhood.

1343
01:39:50,573 --> 01:39:53,041
Our justice must be swift...

1344
01:39:53,243 --> 01:39:54,801
...and merciless.

1345
01:39:56,980 --> 01:39:57,969
That is all.

1346
01:40:07,824 --> 01:40:09,416
Might l have a word with you?

1347
01:40:12,929 --> 01:40:15,955
We're trying to run down a lead
on an associate of Vincennes.

1348
01:40:16,166 --> 01:40:18,999
The records check has led to a dead end.

1349
01:40:19,269 --> 01:40:20,497
What's the name?

1350
01:40:20,770 --> 01:40:22,328
Rollo Tomasi?

1351
01:40:24,274 --> 01:40:26,265
You ever heard Vincennes mention him?

1352
01:40:29,112 --> 01:40:30,841
No. No, l haven't.

1353
01:40:35,518 --> 01:40:37,509
lt's probably nothing. Still...

1354
01:40:38,621 --> 01:40:40,680
...keep your eyes open, boyo.

1355
01:40:50,867 --> 01:40:53,665
l know it's unlikely, but suppose,
just for a moment...

1356
01:40:53,870 --> 01:40:57,203
...somebody had a lot of heroin,
who would they go to to move it?

1357
01:40:57,807 --> 01:40:59,900
White, in my office.

1358
01:41:00,143 --> 01:41:02,703
Captain. Look, just give me a name.

1359
01:41:03,479 --> 01:41:04,878
Mickey Cohen.

1360
01:41:10,820 --> 01:41:11,787
Captain?

1361
01:41:11,988 --> 01:41:14,650
l could use your fearsome
habits at the Victory Motel.

1362
01:41:15,992 --> 01:41:17,186
When?

1363
01:41:18,494 --> 01:41:19,518
Now.

1364
01:41:21,898 --> 01:41:23,559
Close the door, lad.

1365
01:41:31,074 --> 01:41:33,907
You're a bit of a
puzzlement to me these days.

1366
01:41:34,344 --> 01:41:36,505
You don't seem your old cruel self.

1367
01:41:37,180 --> 01:41:40,149
And l had such
grand plans for your future.

1368
01:41:40,350 --> 01:41:41,578
What plans?

1369
01:41:43,019 --> 01:41:47,012
You have your extracurricular activities
and l have mine.

1370
01:41:50,093 --> 01:41:53,085
We must have a clarification session
one of these days.

1371
01:41:54,264 --> 01:41:55,196
However...

1372
01:41:56,032 --> 01:41:57,363
...right now...

1373
01:41:57,867 --> 01:42:01,098
...we'll brace a man who may know
who killed Jack Vincennes.

1374
01:42:01,437 --> 01:42:03,200
So the question is...

1375
01:42:03,539 --> 01:42:05,029
...can l count on you, lad?

1376
01:42:05,275 --> 01:42:07,106
-Yes or no?
-Yes, sir.

1377
01:42:12,215 --> 01:42:15,946
l want to know everything you and
Jack Vincennes talked about last night.

1378
01:42:16,219 --> 01:42:18,244
Start with the l.D. on the corpse.

1379
01:42:18,454 --> 01:42:19,580
An ex-cop.

1380
01:42:19,822 --> 01:42:21,756
Leland ''Buzz'' Meeks.

1381
01:42:21,958 --> 01:42:23,289
An ex-cop?

1382
01:42:23,793 --> 01:42:25,283
Did Jack know him?

1383
01:42:25,895 --> 01:42:27,920
Only by reputation.

1384
01:42:35,305 --> 01:42:36,363
This is Sid Hudgens.

1385
01:42:36,572 --> 01:42:39,200
l'm willing to cooperate.
No need to tie me down.

1386
01:42:39,409 --> 01:42:41,138
lt's for your own safety.

1387
01:42:42,145 --> 01:42:44,306
What can you tell us
about Jack Vincennes?

1388
01:42:45,648 --> 01:42:47,809
Hollywood Jack? The Big V?

1389
01:42:48,084 --> 01:42:50,985
l can tell you he's on
the night train to the Big Adios.

1390
01:42:55,258 --> 01:42:58,819
l had nothing to do with him
getting killed, if that's what you mean.

1391
01:42:59,095 --> 01:43:02,997
-But you were business associates.
-What's that got to do with anything?

1392
01:43:04,867 --> 01:43:07,097
Okay, so we worked together.

1393
01:43:07,570 --> 01:43:09,629
lt was an information exchange.

1394
01:43:09,839 --> 01:43:14,299
l got him first-class collars, he got me
good stories. We were friends.

1395
01:43:14,477 --> 01:43:15,967
We'll drop that for the moment.

1396
01:43:16,479 --> 01:43:18,310
Care to comment on Pierce Patchett?

1397
01:43:18,548 --> 01:43:22,644
You think he had something to do
with Vincennes getting iced?

1398
01:43:23,386 --> 01:43:26,651
Wendell, l'd like full and docile
cooperation on every topic.

1399
01:43:27,223 --> 01:43:29,748
Okay, okay, okay. All right.

1400
01:43:31,327 --> 01:43:34,194
Everyone knows Patchett's
worth a boatload of greenbacks.

1401
01:43:34,664 --> 01:43:36,529
But the man has hobbies too.

1402
01:43:36,733 --> 01:43:39,327
He bankrolls B movies under the table.

1403
01:43:39,736 --> 01:43:41,363
And try this one on.

1404
01:43:41,571 --> 01:43:43,801
He's rumored to be a heroin sniffer.

1405
01:43:44,007 --> 01:43:46,908
All in all, a powerful
behind-the-scenes strange-o.

1406
01:43:47,210 --> 01:43:47,835
And?

1407
01:43:48,044 --> 01:43:49,238
And what?

1408
01:43:53,349 --> 01:43:57,080
Reciprocity, Mr. Hudgens, is the key
to every relationship.

1409
01:44:00,256 --> 01:44:01,814
He runs call girls.

1410
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:06,854
Primo tail fixed up
to look like movie stars.

1411
01:44:09,599 --> 01:44:10,497
And?

1412
01:44:11,100 --> 01:44:12,692
Blackmail shit.

1413
01:44:13,436 --> 01:44:15,768
ln my car, in the trunk,
under the rug....

1414
01:44:16,539 --> 01:44:20,737
Patchett got me to photograph this cop
screwing this gorgeous slut named Lynn.

1415
01:44:20,943 --> 01:44:22,274
She looks like Veronica Lake.

1416
01:44:24,580 --> 01:44:25,410
Leave him!

1417
01:44:25,615 --> 01:44:27,344
l said leave him be!

1418
01:44:27,550 --> 01:44:28,915
Get him away from me!

1419
01:44:29,118 --> 01:44:29,914
Back off!

1420
01:44:30,119 --> 01:44:31,108
Back off!

1421
01:45:15,331 --> 01:45:20,268
l wouldn't trade places with Exley right
now for all the whiskey in lreland.

1422
01:45:24,340 --> 01:45:28,106
Dudley, l thought you were going to
let the dumb bastard kill me!

1423
01:45:28,778 --> 01:45:31,144
Learn to pull your punches
a little better.

1424
01:45:31,347 --> 01:45:33,440
You can uncuff me now, fellas.

1425
01:45:39,122 --> 01:45:40,453
Fellas...

1426
01:45:42,225 --> 01:45:43,157
...we had a deal.

1427
01:45:43,359 --> 01:45:45,020
You, me, Patchett, we're a team.

1428
01:45:50,133 --> 01:45:51,464
Hush-hush.

1429
01:45:52,635 --> 01:45:54,603
-Anything?
-Nothing.

1430
01:45:54,804 --> 01:45:57,602
Meeks never made an arrest
the entire time he worked Vice?

1431
01:45:57,807 --> 01:45:59,775
Someone must've pulled the files.

1432
01:46:02,378 --> 01:46:04,278
What about the daily report books?

1433
01:46:04,480 --> 01:46:06,277
They'd be buried in the basement.

1434
01:46:06,482 --> 01:46:07,710
Find them.

1435
01:46:38,714 --> 01:46:40,272
Did you talk to Exley?

1436
01:46:40,783 --> 01:46:42,546
Come in out of the rain.

1437
01:46:44,554 --> 01:46:46,613
l want to know
what happened with Exley.

1438
01:46:48,391 --> 01:46:49,722
Just come in.

1439
01:46:51,060 --> 01:46:53,688
Are you going to tell me
what happened with Exley?

1440
01:46:54,297 --> 01:46:55,594
We talked.

1441
01:46:56,232 --> 01:46:57,358
Tell me about him.

1442
01:46:57,567 --> 01:46:58,795
Later.

1443
01:46:59,635 --> 01:47:00,795
Now!

1444
01:47:03,973 --> 01:47:05,600
You fucked him.

1445
01:47:09,245 --> 01:47:10,644
You fucked him.

1446
01:47:11,414 --> 01:47:13,405
l thought l was helping you.

1447
01:48:04,467 --> 01:48:06,697
l'm glad you're here.
l need you to see this.

1448
01:48:16,312 --> 01:48:17,301
Wait....

1449
01:48:44,173 --> 01:48:45,663
Dudley killed Jack.

1450
01:48:46,342 --> 01:48:48,173
He wants you to kill me.

1451
01:48:51,247 --> 01:48:53,238
He showed you the photo, didn't he?

1452
01:48:54,083 --> 01:48:55,072
Didn't he?

1453
01:48:57,753 --> 01:48:59,721
Think! ! Goddamn you, think! !

1454
01:49:02,425 --> 01:49:03,551
Get out!

1455
01:49:20,042 --> 01:49:22,203
l checked the daily report books.

1456
01:49:23,379 --> 01:49:26,815
Dudley, Buzz Meeks and
Stensland go way back.

1457
01:49:30,386 --> 01:49:32,286
l knew Stensland lied to me.

1458
01:49:35,291 --> 01:49:38,385
Lefferts' mother l.D.'d
Stensland as Lefferts' boyfriend.

1459
01:49:40,129 --> 01:49:44,725
Stensland pretended he didn't know
Meeks or her the night that l met...

1460
01:49:46,068 --> 01:49:47,228
...Lynn.

1461
01:49:48,137 --> 01:49:49,729
Stensland and Meeks...

1462
01:49:50,239 --> 01:49:51,900
...what the hell were they up to?

1463
01:49:52,641 --> 01:49:56,077
l don't know. But l think
Stens killed Meeks over heroin.

1464
01:49:56,579 --> 01:49:57,637
What heroin?

1465
01:50:03,652 --> 01:50:07,247
Johnny Stompanato told me
that Meeks had heroin for sale.

1466
01:50:07,590 --> 01:50:09,251
Meeks ends up dead.

1467
01:50:09,759 --> 01:50:11,852
Stensland dies at the Nite Owl.

1468
01:50:12,828 --> 01:50:14,591
lt wasn't the Negroes.

1469
01:50:15,598 --> 01:50:17,532
The rape victim lied in
her statement.

1470
01:50:18,100 --> 01:50:21,729
The first guys to the Mercury coupe
were Breuning and Carlisle.

1471
01:50:21,937 --> 01:50:23,427
Dudley's guys.

1472
01:50:23,839 --> 01:50:25,636
They planted the shotguns.

1473
01:50:25,841 --> 01:50:29,174
They'd have killed the Negroes too
if Jack and l hadn't shown up.

1474
01:50:30,179 --> 01:50:33,342
Dudley framed them because
they were Negroes and had records.

1475
01:50:33,682 --> 01:50:36,276
He knew there'd be no questions asked...

1476
01:50:37,686 --> 01:50:40,052
...if they were killed resisting arrest.

1477
01:50:41,123 --> 01:50:43,455
Somehow this is all connected
to Jack's angle.

1478
01:50:44,126 --> 01:50:45,525
Sid Hudgens...

1479
01:50:46,028 --> 01:50:48,292
...the pictures
to blackmail Ellis Loew....

1480
01:50:49,331 --> 01:50:50,525
A kid got murdered.

1481
01:50:51,700 --> 01:50:53,930
To figure this out,
we need to work together.

1482
01:50:59,642 --> 01:51:01,303
Why are you doing this?

1483
01:51:03,312 --> 01:51:05,143
The Nite Owl made you.

1484
01:51:06,982 --> 01:51:08,609
You want to tear all that down?

1485
01:51:10,219 --> 01:51:11,982
With a wrecking ball.

1486
01:51:12,488 --> 01:51:14,319
Want to help me swing it?

1487
01:51:26,602 --> 01:51:28,593
Let's go see Ellis Loew.

1488
01:51:29,171 --> 01:51:31,867
Find out what
the District Attorney knows.

1489
01:51:39,915 --> 01:51:41,576
You can't go in there.

1490
01:51:43,853 --> 01:51:47,050
-Want me to call the police, Mr. Loew?
-Ask for Capt. Dudley Smith.

1491
01:51:47,256 --> 01:51:51,056
Tell him we're discussing an unemployed
actor's death at a Sunset Strip motel.

1492
01:51:51,260 --> 01:51:52,352
These are the police.

1493
01:51:59,101 --> 01:52:00,329
What do you want?

1494
01:52:00,536 --> 01:52:04,802
l want D.A. bureau men to tail Dudley
Smith and Patchett 24 hours a day.

1495
01:52:05,107 --> 01:52:08,508
l want you to get a judge to authorize
wiretaps on their home phones.

1496
01:52:08,711 --> 01:52:11,009
l want authorization
to check their bank records.

1497
01:52:11,547 --> 01:52:12,946
On what evidence?

1498
01:52:13,549 --> 01:52:15,210
Call it a hunch.

1499
01:52:16,452 --> 01:52:18,181
Absolutely not.

1500
01:52:18,387 --> 01:52:21,356
Dudley Smith is a highly decorated
member of the department.

1501
01:52:21,557 --> 01:52:23,582
l won't smear his and
Patchett's name without--

1502
01:52:23,792 --> 01:52:25,191
Without what?

1503
01:52:25,561 --> 01:52:27,290
Them smearing yours first?

1504
01:52:27,630 --> 01:52:31,361
What do they have? Pictures of you
and Matt Reynolds with your pants down?

1505
01:52:33,736 --> 01:52:34,794
You have any proof?

1506
01:52:35,471 --> 01:52:37,200
The proof had his throat slit.

1507
01:52:38,574 --> 01:52:40,735
So far, you're not denying it.

1508
01:52:42,077 --> 01:52:44,045
l won't dignify this with answers.

1509
01:52:44,246 --> 01:52:46,714
Now if you gentlemen will excuse me...

1510
01:52:46,916 --> 01:52:50,750
...l have a press conference for Jack
Vincennes that l have to prepare for.

1511
01:53:01,096 --> 01:53:04,998
Unless you came to wipe my ass,
l believe we're through.

1512
01:53:09,672 --> 01:53:14,006
Don't pull that good cop-bad cop crap.
l practically invented it.

1513
01:53:14,777 --> 01:53:16,972
So what if some homo actor is dead.

1514
01:53:17,179 --> 01:53:20,273
Boys, girls, ten of them
get off the bus to L.A. everyday.

1515
01:53:28,190 --> 01:53:29,487
Pull him off me! !

1516
01:53:29,692 --> 01:53:30,624
l don't know how.

1517
01:53:34,530 --> 01:53:38,432
l know you think you're the A-number-one
hotshot, but here's the juice.

1518
01:53:38,634 --> 01:53:41,102
lf l kill you, 10 lawyers
will take your place tomorrow.

1519
01:53:41,303 --> 01:53:43,134
They just won't come on a bus.

1520
01:53:57,052 --> 01:53:58,144
Okay!

1521
01:53:59,488 --> 01:54:01,718
Dudley and Patchett, they....

1522
01:54:02,791 --> 01:54:03,951
Oh, my God!

1523
01:54:04,159 --> 01:54:06,184
l wouldn't play ball so they set me up!

1524
01:54:06,395 --> 01:54:08,488
l gave in!
But the kid heard everything...

1525
01:54:09,999 --> 01:54:10,966
...so they killed him.

1526
01:54:11,166 --> 01:54:12,155
Why?

1527
01:54:12,534 --> 01:54:15,970
-What are Dudley and Patchett up to?
-Taking over Mickey Cohen's rackets.

1528
01:54:16,171 --> 01:54:20,107
Because of those pictures
l couldn't prosecute them!

1529
01:54:20,509 --> 01:54:21,874
Oh, Jesus!

1530
01:54:22,077 --> 01:54:23,009
Help me up!

1531
01:54:32,154 --> 01:54:34,315
ls that how you ran
the good cop-bad cop?

1532
01:54:36,859 --> 01:54:38,019
Patchett?

1533
01:55:13,462 --> 01:55:16,124
Looks like his bodyguard
had a conflict of interest.

1534
01:55:22,571 --> 01:55:23,936
Suicide note.

1535
01:55:24,139 --> 01:55:28,576
Says he killed Jack because Jack had
figured out his pornography scam.

1536
01:55:28,811 --> 01:55:30,972
Slicing himself open wasn't his idea.

1537
01:55:32,414 --> 01:55:33,881
2 of his fingers
are broken.

1538
01:55:34,083 --> 01:55:34,981
They held him there.

1539
01:55:37,219 --> 01:55:38,151
Or drugged him.

1540
01:55:41,590 --> 01:55:43,387
Dudley's tying up his loose ends.

1541
01:55:44,259 --> 01:55:45,556
Patchett's dead.

1542
01:55:45,761 --> 01:55:47,422
He sent you after me.

1543
01:55:49,098 --> 01:55:50,258
Lynn.

1544
01:55:51,433 --> 01:55:52,627
West Hollywood Sheriff.

1545
01:55:52,835 --> 01:55:55,668
-They're closer than we are.
-l'll get the car. Keys!

1546
01:56:03,178 --> 01:56:05,772
We took her to the station
for safekeeping.

1547
01:56:06,782 --> 01:56:10,343
Hold her as Joan Smith.
And no one sees her unless l okay it.

1548
01:56:11,120 --> 01:56:12,815
Someone worked her over.

1549
01:56:13,021 --> 01:56:14,682
She wouldn't say who.

1550
01:56:19,862 --> 01:56:21,454
See you, Exley.

1551
01:56:24,700 --> 01:56:26,190
We should talk to Lynn.

1552
01:56:27,202 --> 01:56:28,362
You do it.

1553
01:56:29,037 --> 01:56:30,197
What will you do?

1554
01:56:33,475 --> 01:56:35,375
l'm going to talk to Sid Hudgens.

1555
01:56:36,078 --> 01:56:38,774
Compliment him on his
performance at the Victory Motel.

1556
01:56:38,981 --> 01:56:41,211
Remember, Bud, we need evidence.

1557
01:56:42,384 --> 01:56:43,874
l'll get the evidence.

1558
01:56:56,398 --> 01:56:57,387
Are you okay?

1559
01:57:00,169 --> 01:57:01,158
You okay?

1560
01:57:11,847 --> 01:57:13,838
Bud hates himself for what he did.

1561
01:57:15,083 --> 01:57:17,074
l know how he feels.

1562
01:57:19,421 --> 01:57:22,254
l need to know what you
can give me on Dudley Smith.

1563
01:57:24,359 --> 01:57:26,759
He's a police captain
in business with Patchett.

1564
01:57:27,429 --> 01:57:28,919
l've never heard of him.

1565
01:57:33,202 --> 01:57:34,760
Do you have a place to stay?

1566
01:57:36,538 --> 01:57:38,028
l'll be okay.

1567
01:57:44,613 --> 01:57:46,945
Nobody goes in without official l.D.!

1568
01:57:51,720 --> 01:57:53,381
He's okay. Let him through.

1569
01:57:56,959 --> 01:57:58,290
What happened?

1570
01:57:58,894 --> 01:58:01,920
Someone beat him to death,
and stole a bunch of files.

1571
01:58:02,130 --> 01:58:04,121
Must have dug up garbage
on the wrong guy.

1572
01:58:04,566 --> 01:58:06,534
We got it narrowed down
to 1000 suspects.

1573
01:58:07,803 --> 01:58:09,065
Sergeant White...

1574
01:58:10,072 --> 01:58:11,699
...dispatch got a call for you.

1575
01:58:11,907 --> 01:58:14,933
Lieutenant Exley wants you
to meet him at the Victory Motel.

1576
01:58:48,944 --> 01:58:50,502
You wanted to meet here?

1577
01:58:52,614 --> 01:58:55,606
-You called it. l thought Hudgens was--
-Hudgens is dead.

1578
01:59:07,029 --> 01:59:08,621
Let's get out of here.

1579
01:59:16,038 --> 01:59:17,369
lt's too late.

1580
02:00:06,922 --> 02:00:09,049
You figured it was a set-up
but came anyway?

1581
02:00:09,257 --> 02:00:11,248
A lot of bad stuff happened here.

1582
02:00:11,760 --> 02:00:14,024
lt's as good a place
as any for it to end.

1583
02:00:24,272 --> 02:00:25,364
Clip.

1584
02:00:30,445 --> 02:00:33,209
All l ever wanted was to
measure up to my father.

1585
02:00:34,282 --> 02:00:35,214
Now's your chance.

1586
02:00:37,953 --> 02:00:39,784
He died in the line of duty, didn't he?

1587
02:02:39,441 --> 02:02:40,408
Goddamn it!

1588
02:03:40,802 --> 02:03:41,530
You okay?

1589
02:03:42,404 --> 02:03:43,632
Yeah.

1590
02:04:02,157 --> 02:04:04,148
Come on. Easy.

1591
02:04:10,932 --> 02:04:11,830
Move!

1592
02:04:34,522 --> 02:04:36,012
Rollo Tomasi.

1593
02:04:39,461 --> 02:04:40,792
Who is he?

1594
02:04:41,630 --> 02:04:42,756
You are.

1595
02:04:45,033 --> 02:04:46,864
You're the guy who gets away with it.

1596
02:04:50,972 --> 02:04:52,098
Jack knew it.

1597
02:04:52,307 --> 02:04:53,638
And so do l.

1598
02:05:19,334 --> 02:05:21,063
Are you going to shoot me...

1599
02:05:22,337 --> 02:05:23,395
...or arrest me?

1600
02:05:29,744 --> 02:05:31,075
Good lad.

1601
02:05:31,846 --> 02:05:33,780
Always the politician.

1602
02:05:34,416 --> 02:05:36,247
Let me do the talking.

1603
02:05:36,851 --> 02:05:39,911
After l'm done,
they'll make you Chief of Detectives.

1604
02:06:07,782 --> 02:06:09,443
Hold up your badge...

1605
02:06:09,784 --> 02:06:11,718
...so they'll know you're a policeman.

1606
02:07:02,270 --> 02:07:05,103
You think you can talk
your way out of this, Lieutenant?

1607
02:07:07,709 --> 02:07:08,869
No...

1608
02:07:09,144 --> 02:07:10,736
...but l can tell the truth.

1609
02:07:11,713 --> 02:07:13,613
During our investigation...

1610
02:07:14,716 --> 02:07:17,810
...of events surrounding
the Nite Owl case...

1611
02:07:18,887 --> 02:07:22,323
...Jack Vincennes, Bud White
and l learned the following:

1612
02:07:23,057 --> 02:07:25,525
Your golden boy's
throwing his whole life away.

1613
02:07:25,727 --> 02:07:27,285
The 3 Nite Owl suspects...

1614
02:07:28,229 --> 02:07:30,663
...while guilty of
kidnapping and rape...

1615
02:07:31,499 --> 02:07:34,491
...were innocent of the
multiple homicides at the Nite Owl.

1616
02:07:35,837 --> 02:07:37,805
The gunmen were most likely...

1617
02:07:38,006 --> 02:07:42,807
...Los Angeles police officers
Michael Breuning and William Carlisle...

1618
02:07:43,011 --> 02:07:44,501
...and a third man...

1619
02:07:45,180 --> 02:07:48,843
...who may or may not have been
Captain Dudley Smith.

1620
02:07:49,918 --> 02:07:51,351
The objective:

1621
02:07:52,353 --> 02:07:54,981
The elimination of
another police officer...

1622
02:07:55,190 --> 02:07:57,021
...Richard Stensland...

1623
02:07:57,926 --> 02:08:02,863
...who, along with former LAPD officer
Leland ''Buzz'' Meeks...

1624
02:08:03,932 --> 02:08:07,698
...also committed multiple homicides
on behalf of Captain Smith...

1625
02:08:08,369 --> 02:08:09,927
...and then betrayed him...

1626
02:08:10,205 --> 02:08:12,435
...over 25 pounds of heroin...

1627
02:08:13,541 --> 02:08:15,372
...the retrieval of which...

1628
02:08:15,710 --> 02:08:18,702
...was the ultimate motivation
behind the Nite Owl killings.

1629
02:08:21,950 --> 02:08:25,215
Beginning with the incarceration
of Mickey Cohen...

1630
02:08:25,620 --> 02:08:30,557
...Capt. Smith has been assuming control
of organized crime in Los Angeles.

1631
02:08:32,393 --> 02:08:36,124
This includes the assassinations
of Mickey Cohen lieutenants...

1632
02:08:36,731 --> 02:08:39,894
...the systematic blackmail
of city officials...

1633
02:08:41,469 --> 02:08:46,065
...and the murders of Susan Lefferts,
Pierce Patchett, Sid Hudgens...

1634
02:08:47,475 --> 02:08:49,568
...and Sergeant Jack Vincennes.

1635
02:08:52,814 --> 02:08:55,647
Captain Smith admitted as much to me...

1636
02:08:56,251 --> 02:08:58,151
...before l shot him...

1637
02:08:58,586 --> 02:09:00,315
...at the Victory Motel.

1638
02:09:02,590 --> 02:09:03,648
That's it.

1639
02:09:05,994 --> 02:09:07,154
Well...

1640
02:09:08,596 --> 02:09:10,655
...the press will have
a field day.

1641
02:09:12,267 --> 02:09:13,734
Christ!

1642
02:09:13,935 --> 02:09:16,233
lt'll stain the Department for years.

1643
02:09:16,437 --> 02:09:17,335
Decades.

1644
02:09:18,673 --> 02:09:21,267
lf we can get the kid to play ball...

1645
02:09:22,277 --> 02:09:24,108
...who's to say what happened?

1646
02:09:25,179 --> 02:09:27,670
Maybe Dudley Smith died a hero.

1647
02:09:27,949 --> 02:09:30,509
-Good idea.
-lf we get the press to play.

1648
02:09:38,359 --> 02:09:41,021
Want to tell me what
you're smiling about?

1649
02:09:46,534 --> 02:09:47,796
A hero.

1650
02:09:48,369 --> 02:09:50,098
How'd he know what we said?

1651
02:09:50,305 --> 02:09:51,966
He couldn't have heard us.

1652
02:09:55,810 --> 02:09:57,641
ln this situation...

1653
02:09:58,046 --> 02:09:59,980
...you'll need more than one.

1654
02:10:06,888 --> 02:10:11,825
lt is my pleasure to present this award
to Detective Lieutenant Edmund Exley...

1655
02:10:12,393 --> 02:10:14,486
...two-time Medal of Valor recipient.

1656
02:10:24,672 --> 02:10:28,665
Next year the LAPD
will move into its new facility.

1657
02:10:29,010 --> 02:10:30,705
With leaders like Edmund Exley...

1658
02:10:30,912 --> 02:10:34,040
...the image of fat cops stealing apples
will be left behind...

1659
02:10:34,248 --> 02:10:38,184
...and Los Angeles will finally
have the police force it deserves.

1660
02:10:52,100 --> 02:10:54,227
You just couldn't resist.

1661
02:10:54,469 --> 02:10:57,029
They're using me.
So for a while, l'm using them.

1662
02:10:59,040 --> 02:11:00,098
Come on.

1663
02:11:35,076 --> 02:11:36,373
Thanks for the push.

1664
02:11:58,132 --> 02:12:00,157
Congratulations, Lieutenant Exley.

1665
02:12:03,504 --> 02:12:05,597
Some men get the world...

1666
02:12:06,107 --> 02:12:09,668
...others get ex-hookers
and a trip to Arizona.
