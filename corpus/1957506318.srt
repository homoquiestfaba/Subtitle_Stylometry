00:00:18,844 --> 00:00:21,151
KIM JAMESON: The
Renaissance was a time

3
00:00:21,282 --> 00:00:23,545
of rebirth and rediscovery...

4
00:00:23,675 --> 00:00:25,982
a time when artists took a fresh look at the world

5
00:00:26,113 --> 00:00:27,897
in which they lived.

6
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,465
And these artists helped to rekindle a sense of adventure

7
00:00:30,595 --> 00:00:33,076
and romance as they struck out to discover things

8
00:00:33,207 --> 00:00:35,426
about themselves and the world that they had never

9
00:00:35,557 --> 00:00:36,688
taken a close look at before.

10
00:00:42,607 --> 00:00:45,567
Now during this period, each
city had a school of art

11
00:00:45,697 --> 00:00:48,744
with its own style and approach.

12
00:00:48,874 --> 00:00:50,702
But all were
dedicated to a feeling

13
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:56,360
for the individual, their personal emotions, and beauty.

14
00:00:56,491 --> 00:00:58,101
Now this can best
be seen in the work

15
00:00:58,232 --> 00:01:05,891
of [inaudible] contemporary of,um, Veronese and Tintoretto.

16
00:01:06,022 --> 00:01:06,892
[bell tolling]

17
00:01:07,023 --> 00:01:08,894
[music playing]

18
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:30,002
All of these painters explored light and dark with their use

19
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:32,048
of color and composition.

20
00:01:32,179 --> 00:01:35,182
They were trying to illustrate the diversity of human nature

21
00:01:35,312 --> 00:01:38,054
and human individuality,the way in which all of us

22
00:01:38,185 --> 00:01:41,666
have a light side and a
dark side to our nature.

23
00:01:41,797 --> 00:01:43,494
That sounds a
little pretentious.

24
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:44,973
OK, it's the right idea.

25
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:48,064
Just try and not be
so serious about it.

26
00:01:48,195 --> 00:01:50,414
OK, "Lady in
Reflection" Illustrates

27
00:01:50,545 --> 00:01:51,285
that essential quality.

28
00:01:55,376 --> 00:01:57,813
It also reminds us that the face we show the world

29
00:01:57,943 --> 00:02:01,338
is often different
from our true self.

30
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:04,559
Now, despite the
impression of vanity,

31
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:07,779
[inaudible] interest was in showing that true beauty

32
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,128
comes from within.

33
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:11,218
Ms. Jameson, the
rest of the campus

34
00:02:11,348 --> 00:02:13,655
is under the impression
it's summer break.

35
00:02:13,785 --> 00:02:16,179
The rest of the campus don’t have a doctoral thesis

36
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,702
to deliver this fall.

37
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:19,530
And besides my
lectures, I have about

38
00:02:19,661 --> 00:02:22,054
three dozen research papers to read, not to mention your text.

39
00:02:22,185 --> 00:02:24,840
What kind of a summer is that?

40
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:29,975
My dear, you are without a doubt our brightest graduate student.

41
00:02:30,106 --> 00:02:33,501
Your scholarly instincts
are remarkable.

42
00:02:33,631 --> 00:02:35,590
But a work of art
depends as much

43
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:41,335
on what we bring to it as what the artist gives us to look at.

44
00:02:41,465 --> 00:02:45,252
Art is only a reflection
of life, Ms. Jameson.

45
00:02:45,382 --> 00:02:48,211
It is necessary for
us to have a life

46
00:02:48,341 --> 00:02:51,475
before we can truly
appreciate it.

47
00:02:51,606 --> 00:02:56,219
You need to show your
true face to the world.

48
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,567
Maybe after I have my PhD.

49
00:03:00,571 --> 00:03:05,097
Well, right know, I need you to join the class outside.

50
00:03:05,228 --> 00:03:07,839
Oh, not another group picture.

51
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:10,102
Just say...

52
00:03:10,233 --> 00:03:12,103
Cheese!

53
00:03:12,235 --> 00:03:15,064
Sorry, I forgot
to advance the film.

54
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,458
I hate having
my picture taken.

55
00:03:17,588 --> 00:03:20,548
Now, now, Miss, Jameson,leave us not be testy.

56
00:03:20,678 --> 00:03:23,812
This is my end of term portrait,and you more than anyone

57
00:03:23,942 --> 00:03:26,858
should appreciate the
photographic process.

58
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:28,599
Smiles everyone.
[click]

59
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:29,513
There.

60
00:03:29,644 --> 00:03:31,123
All right, now.

61
00:03:31,254 --> 00:03:32,037
Ready?

62
00:03:33,691 --> 00:03:34,475
Cheese!

63
00:04:00,718 --> 00:04:02,503
I thought it might be you.

64
00:04:02,633 --> 00:04:05,027
Kate!

65
00:04:05,157 --> 00:04:06,811
Oh, it is so good to see you.

66
00:04:06,942 --> 00:04:09,379
I just got in from Paris.

67
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,163
Duty free.

68
00:04:11,294 --> 00:04:14,515
I knew I couldn't count on you for anything stronger than tea.

69
00:04:14,645 --> 00:04:15,385
Welcome home!

70
00:04:19,476 --> 00:04:20,651
How did you get in?

71
00:04:20,781 --> 00:04:21,826
What do you think?

72
00:04:21,957 --> 00:04:24,046
I told the doorman
I forgot my key.

73
00:04:24,176 --> 00:04:25,743
He said that he
liked your new look.

74
00:04:25,874 --> 00:04:27,136
Oh, that old game.

75
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,529
As fun as it ever was.

76
00:04:28,659 --> 00:04:30,052
Yeah, it was fun
when we were kids.

77
00:04:33,316 --> 00:04:35,187
That's right, uh, you
haven't like playing

78
00:04:35,318 --> 00:04:37,886
it since, what was his name?

79
00:04:38,016 --> 00:04:38,713
It's Peter Robinson.

80
00:04:43,239 --> 00:04:45,981
Oh God, I have missed you, Kate.

81
00:04:46,111 --> 00:04:48,940
Mmm, the name is
Dominique now, remember?

82
00:04:54,076 --> 00:04:54,859
What?

83
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,644
You all right?

84
00:04:56,774 --> 00:04:57,471
You look tired.

85
00:05:01,475 --> 00:05:03,738
Yeah, you just haven't
seen me in a while.

86
00:05:08,569 --> 00:05:12,137
Four years isn't a while.

87
00:05:12,268 --> 00:05:13,443
Has it been that long?

88
00:05:13,574 --> 00:05:14,749
Mm-hm.

89
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,665
Even longer since
you've seen mom and dad.

90
00:05:17,795 --> 00:05:21,103
Well, they must be happy with all your degrees.

91
00:05:21,233 --> 00:05:24,759
I think that they’re proud of both of us, Kate.

92
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:27,283
Well, so we should celebrate!

93
00:05:27,414 --> 00:05:30,242
Put on your party dress because
I am taking you dancing.

94
00:05:30,373 --> 00:05:31,331
Nah, I don't think that...

95
00:05:31,461 --> 00:05:33,550
Mmm, thinking is not required.

96
00:05:33,681 --> 00:05:37,293
What is required is something black and sexy.

97
00:05:37,424 --> 00:05:38,642
I've got one you can wear.

98
00:05:38,773 --> 00:05:40,252
I came in town to do
a favor for a friend

99
00:05:40,383 --> 00:05:43,125
and I may as well do you a favor and get you out too.

100
00:05:43,255 --> 00:05:45,954
Come on.[excited chatter and cheers]

101
00:06:01,926 --> 00:06:03,754
[inaudible] beautiful.

102
00:06:03,885 --> 00:06:04,712
Thank you.

103
00:06:12,328 --> 00:06:15,592
Wow, I can't wait to tell Mr.Arneau how fabulous this is.

104
00:06:15,723 --> 00:06:17,028
Anything for Jacques.

105
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,429
Would you take care
of my sister please?

106
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,867
Oh, sure.

107
00:06:29,998 --> 00:06:37,745
[inaudible] Come on, please.

108
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:38,702
Let the lady through.

109
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,146
What were you doing?

110
00:06:48,277 --> 00:06:49,582
This really isn't
my style, Kate.

111
00:06:49,713 --> 00:06:50,758
Come on.

112
00:06:50,888 --> 00:06:51,976
You're going to go
have a good time

113
00:06:52,107 --> 00:06:53,413
whether you want to or not.

114
00:06:57,982 --> 00:06:59,810
[dance music]

115
00:07:24,313 --> 00:07:27,229
I can't believe you
get paid for this.

116
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:28,622
We just put this
dump on the map.

117
00:07:28,752 --> 00:07:29,623
Hey, Dominique.

118
00:07:29,753 --> 00:07:30,624
Care to dance?

119
00:07:30,754 --> 00:07:32,582
[dance music]

120
00:08:40,302 --> 00:08:45,873
[groaning] Start up.

121
00:08:46,003 --> 00:08:48,353
OK.

122
00:08:48,484 --> 00:08:50,007
Thanks, Tony.

123
00:08:50,138 --> 00:08:51,574
I'll let Jacques know
what a hit you were.

124
00:08:51,705 --> 00:08:54,490
Anything for Jacques.

125
00:08:54,621 --> 00:08:55,883
Come on, what are
we waiting for?

126
00:08:56,013 --> 00:08:57,928
Sorry, it's been a long day.

127
00:08:58,059 --> 00:08:59,190
The jet lag finally hit.

128
00:09:06,807 --> 00:09:08,156
Take it easy.

129
00:09:11,812 --> 00:09:12,682
Ooh.

130
00:09:12,813 --> 00:09:18,601
[laughs] Oh.

131
00:09:21,778 --> 00:09:23,388
KIM: Maybe you
should just lay off.

132
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,521
Oh if I need it, I'd take it.

133
00:09:25,652 --> 00:09:27,305
If I don't, I don't.

134
00:09:27,436 --> 00:09:29,960
You've been
drinking all night.

135
00:09:30,091 --> 00:09:33,790
Why don't you get a life,Kim, so you don't envy mine?

136
00:09:33,921 --> 00:09:36,010
I don't envy alcoholics, Kate.

137
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,011
I work hard.

138
00:09:37,141 --> 00:09:39,361
It steadies me.

139
00:09:39,491 --> 00:09:41,189
Right now, you got to be steady enough to climb Mt.

140
00:09:41,319 --> 00:09:42,146
Everest.

141
00:09:42,277 --> 00:09:43,278
Cut the sarcasm, Kim.

142
00:09:43,408 --> 00:09:44,627
It doesn't suit your image.

143
00:09:44,758 --> 00:09:46,586
The way falling down
drunk suits yours?

144
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:54,289
God, Kate, I'm so sorry.

145
00:09:54,419 --> 00:09:55,595
Look, I'm in trouble, OK?

146
00:09:55,725 --> 00:09:56,465
Are you satisfied?

147
00:09:59,947 --> 00:10:02,297
I arrive late at photo sessions.

148
00:10:02,427 --> 00:10:05,430
I can't walk straight sometimes.

149
00:10:05,561 --> 00:10:08,216
I need one of these or
I can't even remember

150
00:10:08,346 --> 00:10:09,086
where I'm supposed to be.

151
00:10:13,395 --> 00:10:15,745
I want to stop and
I'm not strong enough.

152
00:10:15,876 --> 00:10:17,704
Well, you don't
have to do this alone.

153
00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:19,183
There's a good
rehab center here.

154
00:10:19,314 --> 00:10:20,402
I can't.

155
00:10:20,532 --> 00:10:23,057
My career would
be over in a week.

156
00:10:23,187 --> 00:10:24,928
Come on, recovery
is a status symbol.

157
00:10:25,059 --> 00:10:27,627
Everybody who's anybody is coming back from something.

158
00:10:30,281 --> 00:10:31,065
Look.

159
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,072
This is Jacqueline, Kim...

160
00:10:38,202 --> 00:10:41,815
little miss young and ruthless.

161
00:10:41,945 --> 00:10:45,557
She wants to be the next
Chamber 10 cover girl.

162
00:10:45,688 --> 00:10:49,431
If they found out I was drying out, she'd take my place.

163
00:10:49,561 --> 00:10:52,216
And once you're off the cover, you never get back.

164
00:10:52,347 --> 00:10:54,610
We're talking about
your life, Kate.

165
00:10:54,741 --> 00:10:57,744
This is my life.

166
00:10:57,874 --> 00:11:00,877
Without it, I don't
have anything.

167
00:11:01,008 --> 00:11:02,096
I wish I could
take your place.

168
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:08,842
What did you say?

169
00:11:08,972 --> 00:11:10,060
I said, it's...

170
00:11:10,191 --> 00:11:11,453
it's too bad I can't
fill in for you.

171
00:11:14,282 --> 00:11:15,675
No.

172
00:11:15,805 --> 00:11:17,024
Yes.

173
00:11:17,154 --> 00:11:19,156
No.

174
00:11:19,287 --> 00:11:21,158
Yes.

175
00:11:21,289 --> 00:11:22,072
Take my place.

176
00:11:22,203 --> 00:11:23,291
Kate, don't be crazy.

177
00:11:23,421 --> 00:11:24,640
I told you that I never...

178
00:11:24,771 --> 00:11:26,816
It would work, Kim.

179
00:11:26,947 --> 00:11:30,298
You'd save my
career and my life.

180
00:11:30,428 --> 00:11:33,301
No.

181
00:11:33,431 --> 00:11:36,043
Please?

182
00:11:36,173 --> 00:11:39,655
It's the only way.

183
00:11:39,786 --> 00:11:42,049
You'd check into rehab?

184
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:42,963
Yes.

185
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,359
I can't do the things
that you do I don't

186
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,622
have your grace or your style.

187
00:11:50,753 --> 00:11:52,494
I'll teach you.

188
00:11:52,624 --> 00:11:55,366
Kim, it would work people always got us confused.

189
00:11:55,497 --> 00:11:57,412
We're from
different worlds now.

190
00:11:57,542 --> 00:11:59,066
I could never be
as free as you are.

191
00:11:59,196 --> 00:12:01,808
I don't have your strength.- You call this strength?

192
00:12:04,593 --> 00:12:07,422
- It would never work.
- You wanna bet?

193
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:17,693
Get rid of that ponytail.

194
00:12:27,964 --> 00:12:28,835
So?

195
00:12:28,965 --> 00:12:30,575
What do you think?

196
00:12:30,706 --> 00:12:37,800
This is too crazy for words,but I'll try if you'll try.

197
00:12:43,197 --> 00:12:44,807
That's better.

198
00:12:44,938 --> 00:12:45,677
Good.

199
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:52,162
Come on back.

200
00:12:52,293 --> 00:12:54,382
One, two, three four.

201
00:12:54,512 --> 00:12:56,645
One, two, three, four.

202
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,386
Kate, this will never work.

203
00:12:58,516 --> 00:13:00,388
I can't do this on a runway.

204
00:13:00,518 --> 00:13:01,824
So you won't have to.

205
00:13:01,955 --> 00:13:03,391
We only do the big
runway shows when

206
00:13:03,521 --> 00:13:05,306
we're debuting the new lines.

207
00:13:05,436 --> 00:13:08,091
The Chamber 10 line doesn’t debut for six weeks.

208
00:13:08,222 --> 00:13:10,354
You said you only had tobe in the clinic for four.

209
00:13:10,485 --> 00:13:13,749
Yeah, but I still have
to act like a model.

210
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,272
You only have a
few private showings

211
00:13:15,403 --> 00:13:17,013
scheduled at the salon.

212
00:13:17,144 --> 00:13:19,102
Henri will be so happy I'm not bumping into the customers,

213
00:13:19,233 --> 00:13:20,887
he won't notice your technique.

214
00:13:21,017 --> 00:13:22,279
Henri?

215
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:25,195
Henri Chambertin of
the house of Chambertin.

216
00:13:31,723 --> 00:13:33,638
Actually, I should
draw you a floor plan.

217
00:13:33,769 --> 00:13:35,205
Paul is his doorman.

218
00:13:35,336 --> 00:13:37,512
You have a nodding acquaintance with the salesgirls,

219
00:13:37,642 --> 00:13:39,862
and Marie is the chief fitter.

220
00:13:39,993 --> 00:13:41,385
I helped her out of a
jam a little while ago,

221
00:13:41,516 --> 00:13:45,085
so if you need her,
you can count on her.

222
00:13:45,215 --> 00:13:46,260
Now who's he?

223
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,522
Philip Clairmont.

224
00:13:47,652 --> 00:13:49,263
He's an American.

225
00:13:49,393 --> 00:13:50,873
He's Henri's new partner,bought a controlling interest

226
00:13:51,004 --> 00:13:52,092
in the company last year.

227
00:13:52,222 --> 00:13:53,267
He's not bad looking.

228
00:13:53,397 --> 00:13:54,572
KATE: Yeah?

229
00:13:54,703 --> 00:13:56,357
Well, he doesn't
have much use for me.

230
00:13:56,487 --> 00:13:59,099
He would love to fire
me, but he can't.

231
00:13:59,229 --> 00:14:00,361
Why not?

232
00:14:00,491 --> 00:14:03,320
Because I'm a star.

233
00:14:03,451 --> 00:14:05,757
The question is, am I?

234
00:14:05,888 --> 00:14:07,368
This will tell
you about everyone

235
00:14:07,498 --> 00:14:09,761
and everything you'll need to know for the next month.

236
00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:12,852
What about the man they opened the club for, Jacques Arneau?

237
00:14:12,982 --> 00:14:14,157
He's gone to Hong
Kong for a month,

238
00:14:14,288 --> 00:14:15,680
so you don't have
to worry about him.

239
00:14:15,811 --> 00:14:17,508
Is he someone special?

240
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:19,728
No, he owns some nightclubs.

241
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:20,947
He sort of designs the scene.

242
00:14:21,077 --> 00:14:21,904
Just forget about him.

243
00:14:25,473 --> 00:14:28,476
It's almost 3:00.

244
00:14:28,606 --> 00:14:32,654
Well, let's get ready
and get out of here

245
00:14:32,784 --> 00:14:33,742
before I change my mind.

246
00:14:40,923 --> 00:14:42,925
KIM: Kate, relax.

247
00:14:43,056 --> 00:14:44,884
Fair Oaks has a
great reputation.

248
00:14:45,014 --> 00:14:46,189
They're among the
best in the world,

249
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,277
and they're very discrete.

250
00:14:55,546 --> 00:15:00,029
I know this is hard, Kate, but you’re doing the right thing.

251
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,422
Maybe you should just
phone and tell them

252
00:15:01,552 --> 00:15:02,858
you don't know where I am.

253
00:15:02,989 --> 00:15:05,556
I'll figure out something later.

254
00:15:05,687 --> 00:15:07,210
No, it'll work out.

255
00:15:07,341 --> 00:15:10,213
Just leave it to me and concentrate on getting better.

256
00:15:13,869 --> 00:15:16,132
Ms. Jameson?

257
00:15:16,263 --> 00:15:18,352
I'll take you up and
register you now.

258
00:15:18,482 --> 00:15:20,963
The doctor will be along later.

259
00:15:21,094 --> 00:15:23,009
And don't worry.

260
00:15:23,139 --> 00:15:25,925
We're here to help
you through this, not

261
00:15:26,055 --> 00:15:28,623
judge what brought you to us.

262
00:15:28,753 --> 00:15:30,842
I'll call you
as soon as I can.

263
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:32,714
I'm sorry, there are no
calls or visits allowed

264
00:15:32,844 --> 00:15:34,281
for the first three weeks.

265
00:15:34,411 --> 00:15:35,673
It's best for all concerned.

266
00:15:38,894 --> 00:15:41,244
I love you, Kate.

267
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:42,767
And don't worry about a thing.

268
00:16:22,633 --> 00:16:26,159
Mademoiselle Dominique?

269
00:16:26,289 --> 00:16:27,595
Mademoiselle Dominique?

270
00:16:27,725 --> 00:16:31,555
Monsieur Arneau requested we meet your plane.

271
00:16:31,686 --> 00:16:32,948
We?

272
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:35,298
He felt the world
should know Dominique

273
00:16:35,429 --> 00:16:37,909
had returned to Paris.

274
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,868
[photographers chatter]

275
00:17:59,426 --> 00:18:00,209
Stop.

276
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,080
Um, stop.

277
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:07,695
Stop... [speaking french]

278
00:18:07,825 --> 00:18:09,175
[music playing]

279
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:14,038
Welcome home.

280
00:20:14,169 --> 00:20:15,910
I'm sorry I had to
send the limo instead

281
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:16,824
of meeting you in person.

282
00:20:22,917 --> 00:20:25,833
You like the flowers?

283
00:20:25,963 --> 00:20:27,269
Yes, thank you.

284
00:20:36,409 --> 00:20:39,194
I thought that you had,uh, business in Hong Kong.

285
00:20:39,325 --> 00:20:41,936
Yes, I made my
business arrangements

286
00:20:42,066 --> 00:20:44,852
more quickly than I expected.

287
00:20:44,982 --> 00:20:48,856
The new club owner said
you were wonderful.

288
00:20:51,946 --> 00:20:52,729
I'm glad.

289
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:01,782
Perhaps it's time to discuss another type of performance.

290
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:07,091
Excuse me?

291
00:21:10,225 --> 00:21:11,922
I told you when I came
back from Hong Kong,

292
00:21:12,053 --> 00:21:13,750
I wanted to discuss
an important matter.

293
00:21:19,582 --> 00:21:24,935
Don't tell me you’ve forgotten, [speaking french]

294
00:21:25,066 --> 00:21:27,721
Actually, uh,
I'm a little tired.

295
00:21:27,851 --> 00:21:30,637
Would you mind if
we discuss it later?

296
00:21:30,767 --> 00:21:32,247
Fair enough.

297
00:21:32,378 --> 00:21:33,857
But we can't leave
it too long, can we?

298
00:21:37,774 --> 00:21:40,299
Let's have dinner at
[inaudible] this week.

299
00:21:40,429 --> 00:21:43,084
That would be fine.

300
00:21:43,214 --> 00:21:44,999
Don't forget to dream of me.

301
00:21:45,129 --> 00:21:46,914
[music playing]

302
00:22:21,557 --> 00:22:26,388
[phone ringing]

303
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,653
Hello?

304
00:22:30,784 --> 00:22:32,133
Who?

305
00:22:32,263 --> 00:22:34,440
Henri.

306
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:37,356
No, of course I
haven't forgotten.

307
00:22:37,486 --> 00:22:39,793
My plane was late.

308
00:22:39,923 --> 00:22:40,620
I'll be right there.

309
00:22:46,234 --> 00:22:50,020
[music playing]
[SINGING] I'll do it.

310
00:22:50,151 --> 00:22:52,545
I'll do it.

311
00:22:52,675 --> 00:22:55,983
I'll do anything.

312
00:22:56,113 --> 00:23:00,030
I'll do anything.

313
00:23:00,161 --> 00:23:03,425
I'll do anything for you.

314
00:23:03,556 --> 00:23:07,429
I'll do anything.

315
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,910
I'll do anything for you.

316
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,393
And I will like.

317
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:33,977
Mademoiselle Dominique.

318
00:23:34,108 --> 00:23:35,022
Good morning, Paul.

319
00:23:45,511 --> 00:23:46,860
Good morning, Dominiques.

320
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:47,774
Good morning.

321
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:55,521
Paul's the door man.

322
00:23:55,651 --> 00:23:58,741
You have a nodding acquaintance with the sales girls.

323
00:23:58,872 --> 00:24:00,308
Marie is the fitter.

324
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,440
[WHISPERS] Just confidence.

325
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:02,353
Relax.

326
00:24:08,272 --> 00:24:09,056
Oh!

327
00:24:09,186 --> 00:24:11,493
Oh, I'm so sorry,

328
00:24:11,624 --> 00:24:12,363
Sorry.

329
00:24:15,976 --> 00:24:18,195
I see you decided
to come back to us.

330
00:24:18,326 --> 00:24:21,764
Yeah, I just went
away for a few days.

331
00:24:21,895 --> 00:24:24,724
Without letting anyone here know where you were going.

332
00:24:24,854 --> 00:24:26,465
Won't happen again.

333
00:24:26,595 --> 00:24:28,902
You may still think you’re a star, but some of us

334
00:24:29,032 --> 00:24:31,078
are having our doubts.

335
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:33,428
I didn't realize
that visiting my sister

336
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:35,909
was any of your business.

337
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:38,128
Anything that takes you out of Paris is my business.

338
00:24:38,259 --> 00:24:40,043
Including my private affairs.

339
00:24:40,174 --> 00:24:42,568
When you go out of town to open a new club for Arneau,

340
00:24:42,698 --> 00:24:44,352
I can't help thinking you
have something to hide.

341
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:45,875
And I can't help
thinking that you're...

342
00:24:46,006 --> 00:24:47,268
Dominique?

343
00:24:47,398 --> 00:24:49,226
This can't be you.

344
00:24:49,357 --> 00:24:50,489
Look at her, Phillip.

345
00:24:50,619 --> 00:24:53,666
She has put on at
least five pounds.

346
00:24:53,796 --> 00:24:55,058
I think she looks
almost normal.

347
00:24:55,189 --> 00:24:57,147
My customers don't
like normal women.

348
00:24:57,278 --> 00:24:59,062
We will have to give the
finale to Jacqueline.

349
00:24:59,193 --> 00:25:00,499
She will never
get into the gown.

350
00:25:00,629 --> 00:25:02,370
Yeah, she may have had
too much home cooking,

351
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:05,068
but she is not deaf.

352
00:25:05,199 --> 00:25:07,767
You can talk to me.

353
00:25:07,897 --> 00:25:09,725
And the gown will look better with more of me in it.

354
00:25:15,862 --> 00:25:17,341
What do you think, Phillip?

355
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:24,261
I think if the gown, fits,we should let her wear it.

356
00:25:24,392 --> 00:25:25,959
Well, thank you.

357
00:25:26,089 --> 00:25:27,874
If you'll excuse
me, Marie's waiting.

358
00:25:38,493 --> 00:25:41,540
Carmen, you're in the solids.

359
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:45,152
Jacqueline, you're
in the polka dots.

360
00:25:45,282 --> 00:25:48,068
Polka dots make me
look like a child!

361
00:25:48,198 --> 00:25:49,548
You want me to
tell Henri you think

362
00:25:49,678 --> 00:25:52,072
his collection is childish?

363
00:25:52,202 --> 00:25:54,814
Good morning.

364
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:58,948
Your [inaudible]
is there, Dominique.

365
00:25:59,079 --> 00:25:59,819
Sorry, I'm late.

366
00:26:03,083 --> 00:26:05,476
How was your
mysterious weekend?

367
00:26:05,607 --> 00:26:08,262
Ah, uneventful.

368
00:26:08,392 --> 00:26:10,133
Jacqueline was hoping
you'd fall in love

369
00:26:10,264 --> 00:26:12,353
and never come back.

370
00:26:12,483 --> 00:26:14,529
Oh, I'm sure Dominique would never let her heart

371
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,270
interfere with your career.

372
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,447
In fact, I heard she had it removed so it couldn't.

373
00:26:25,627 --> 00:26:28,456
Your sister must
be an excellent cook.

374
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:29,544
My sister?

375
00:26:29,675 --> 00:26:32,373
The one you went to visit.

376
00:26:32,503 --> 00:26:34,070
Why don't you put this on?

377
00:26:34,201 --> 00:26:35,419
It's wider in the hips.

378
00:26:38,379 --> 00:26:41,034
All right, everybody.

379
00:26:41,164 --> 00:26:43,297
Everybody else is free
to leave for the day.

380
00:26:58,704 --> 00:27:00,967
Who are you?

381
00:27:01,097 --> 00:27:05,928
I know Dominique's body,
and this is not it.

382
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:09,149
Are you a twin?

383
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,672
Yes.

384
00:27:10,803 --> 00:27:12,631
Why the hell did she send you?

385
00:27:12,761 --> 00:27:13,632
Where is she?

386
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,942
She's in a rehab center.

387
00:27:20,073 --> 00:27:26,645
Oh, well, she finally admitted she has a problem.

388
00:27:26,775 --> 00:27:29,082
You are a model.

389
00:27:29,212 --> 00:27:31,824
I'm an art history student.

390
00:27:31,954 --> 00:27:33,434
You are as crazy as she is.

391
00:27:33,564 --> 00:27:35,828
You know you'll never
get away with this.

392
00:27:35,958 --> 00:27:37,351
She needs to get well.

393
00:27:37,481 --> 00:27:39,353
I'm only going to cover
for her for a month.

394
00:27:39,483 --> 00:27:40,833
A month?

395
00:27:40,963 --> 00:27:42,051
Oh no!

396
00:27:42,182 --> 00:27:43,966
The new line debuts
next Saturday!

397
00:27:44,097 --> 00:27:44,837
Saturday?

398
00:27:44,967 --> 00:27:45,925
MARIE: Yes.

399
00:27:46,055 --> 00:27:46,795
She told me that it...

400
00:27:46,926 --> 00:27:48,492
No, no, no, no.

401
00:27:48,623 --> 00:27:50,494
Phillip brought the date forward to break the competition.

402
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:53,584
This is our most important runway show in years.

403
00:27:53,715 --> 00:27:55,282
I can't fake a
big fashion show.

404
00:27:55,412 --> 00:27:57,110
No, of course you can't!

405
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,633
We're just going to
have to go to Phillip

406
00:27:58,764 --> 00:27:59,852
and tell him the truth.
- No, no, no.

407
00:27:59,982 --> 00:28:02,115
No, no.Saturday is almost a week away.

408
00:28:02,245 --> 00:28:03,682
We could... I could take lessons.

409
00:28:03,812 --> 00:28:04,552
You could teach me.

410
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:05,727
No, I couldn't.

411
00:28:05,858 --> 00:28:07,511
Philip would find
out immediately,

412
00:28:07,642 --> 00:28:12,342
and if you were found out on the runway, we'd all be finished.

413
00:28:12,473 --> 00:28:14,693
This is insane.

414
00:28:14,823 --> 00:28:17,826
Dominique told me that she helped you out of trouble once.

415
00:28:17,957 --> 00:28:19,219
So?

416
00:28:19,349 --> 00:28:22,091
So maybe it's your
turn to help her out.

417
00:28:22,222 --> 00:28:23,832
Dah!

418
00:28:23,963 --> 00:28:25,573
Please, Marie.

419
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:28,097
She loses her career,
she'll never get sober.

420
00:28:30,534 --> 00:28:31,318
That's true.

421
00:28:34,364 --> 00:28:36,410
Oh, all right.

422
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,498
All right.

423
00:28:37,628 --> 00:28:39,674
I guess I owe her that much.

424
00:28:39,805 --> 00:28:41,371
Thank you.

425
00:28:41,502 --> 00:28:44,679
You just save your thanks until we know that this works.

426
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:45,854
OK.

427
00:28:45,985 --> 00:28:47,377
MARIE: And lose
those few pounds.

428
00:28:47,508 --> 00:28:53,209
[music playing] [SINGING]I'll do anything.

429
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:57,083
I'll do anything for you.

430
00:28:57,213 --> 00:29:00,086
I'll do anything.

431
00:29:00,216 --> 00:29:03,567
Everything.

432
00:29:03,698 --> 00:29:04,568
[inaudible]

433
00:29:27,156 --> 00:29:30,029
I'll do anything for you.

434
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:34,033
I'll do anything.

435
00:29:34,163 --> 00:29:37,993
I'll do anything for you.

436
00:29:38,124 --> 00:29:45,479
I'll do anything
happily, happily.

437
00:29:57,186 --> 00:29:58,622
I trust you know
where these go.

438
00:30:12,593 --> 00:30:13,463
La-la.

439
00:30:13,594 --> 00:30:15,378
[inaudible] Mademoiselle.

440
00:30:15,509 --> 00:30:17,816
[whistles]

441
00:30:17,946 --> 00:30:19,774
[music playing]

442
00:30:51,066 --> 00:30:55,462
[SINGING] I'll do
anything for you.

443
00:30:55,592 --> 00:30:58,421
I'll do anything.

444
00:30:58,552 --> 00:31:02,295
I'll do anything for you.

445
00:31:02,425 --> 00:31:09,041
I'll do anything
happily, happily.

446
00:31:15,264 --> 00:31:17,179
You know, you and your sister have more in common

447
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,050
than you think.

448
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:18,964
KIM: Yeah?

449
00:31:19,094 --> 00:31:20,661
Mm-hm.

450
00:31:20,791 --> 00:31:22,489
Come and sit down for a while.

451
00:31:22,619 --> 00:31:24,665
KIM: No, I've got
to go for a run.

452
00:31:24,795 --> 00:31:26,667
Ah, there's no need to
push yourself so hard.

453
00:31:26,797 --> 00:31:30,976
Besides, Phillipe said he likes you with your new curves.

454
00:31:31,106 --> 00:31:32,716
I don't know how
Kate does this.

455
00:31:32,847 --> 00:31:33,892
Who's Kate?

456
00:31:34,022 --> 00:31:35,850
That was my
sister's real name.

457
00:31:35,981 --> 00:31:38,331
You know, I always thought that she lived this soft life.

458
00:31:38,461 --> 00:31:39,680
A lot of parties, a
lot of boyfriends.

459
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:41,769
Oh, she has a few.

460
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,813
Jacques Arneau?

461
00:31:42,944 --> 00:31:45,164
Never struck me as her type.

462
00:31:45,294 --> 00:31:47,035
Well, she came home
to do him a favor.

463
00:31:47,166 --> 00:31:49,342
He seems to expect
something more.

464
00:31:49,472 --> 00:31:51,213
You be careful.

465
00:31:51,344 --> 00:31:52,475
He may be a charmer.

466
00:31:52,606 --> 00:31:54,216
Hm, he has all the
charm of a cobra.

467
00:32:01,876 --> 00:32:04,574
I can't thank you enough for all you've done for us.

468
00:32:04,705 --> 00:32:06,576
Oh.

469
00:32:06,707 --> 00:32:10,015
Your sister has a lot of faults, but she helped me when

470
00:32:10,145 --> 00:32:12,104
I desperately needed money.

471
00:32:12,234 --> 00:32:14,193
It was very selfless of her.

472
00:32:14,323 --> 00:32:17,936
That seems to run
in your family.

473
00:32:18,066 --> 00:32:23,376
Yeah, Kate sure can mess things up, but she has spirit.

474
00:32:23,506 --> 00:32:25,595
Now that is the
attitude you need

475
00:32:25,726 --> 00:32:27,684
for the runaway, that spirit.

476
00:32:27,815 --> 00:32:29,643
A body is just a body.

477
00:32:29,773 --> 00:32:35,127
The very best models,
they do it all up here.

478
00:32:35,257 --> 00:32:35,997
Up here.

479
00:32:36,128 --> 00:32:37,390
Mm-hm.

480
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,262
It's the ultimate
strut your stuff, yes?

481
00:32:40,393 --> 00:32:41,698
Yes

482
00:32:41,829 --> 00:32:43,657
You have to believe
that you are the most

483
00:32:43,787 --> 00:32:46,703
beautiful woman in the world.

484
00:32:46,834 --> 00:32:50,577
If you believe it, they will.

485
00:32:50,707 --> 00:32:52,535
[music playing]

486
00:33:37,798 --> 00:33:39,191
Thank you.

487
00:33:39,321 --> 00:33:41,193
It's nerves.

488
00:33:41,323 --> 00:33:43,108
[music playing]

489
00:34:04,738 --> 00:34:05,521
Good.

490
00:34:08,655 --> 00:34:11,005
You will be perfect.

491
00:34:11,136 --> 00:34:11,962
Believe it.

492
00:34:12,092 --> 00:34:13,964
[music playing]

493
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:27,413
Don't stumble
tonight, Dominique.

494
00:34:27,543 --> 00:34:29,371
[music playing]

495
00:34:47,781 --> 00:34:48,650
Oh, God.

496
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:55,179
What's the matter with her?

497
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:57,094
[music playing]

498
00:35:03,753 --> 00:35:04,580
[applause]

499
00:35:04,711 --> 00:35:06,104
AUDIENCE: Bravo!

500
00:35:06,234 --> 00:35:08,106
[applause]

00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:19,552
[cheering]

502
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,526
You top that, if you can.

503
00:35:37,657 --> 00:35:39,441
[music playing]

504
00:36:00,027 --> 00:36:01,376
She's a genius!

505
00:36:08,992 --> 00:36:10,907
You'll sell out the line.

506
00:36:11,038 --> 00:36:14,346
I hope so, Henri,
for both our sakes.

507
00:36:14,476 --> 00:36:16,304
[music playing]

508
00:39:19,226 --> 00:39:20,619
You were inspired!

509
00:39:20,749 --> 00:39:22,925
Mmm!

510
00:39:23,056 --> 00:39:24,884
Actually, I was scared stiff.

511
00:39:25,014 --> 00:39:25,885
Ha ha!

512
00:39:26,015 --> 00:39:27,495
And how are you now?

513
00:39:27,626 --> 00:39:28,366
Exhausted.

514
00:39:28,496 --> 00:39:29,323
Oh.

515
00:39:29,454 --> 00:39:33,327
My dear, you were superb!

516
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:35,721
Everybody wants to meet you!

517
00:39:35,851 --> 00:39:37,375
Everybody!

518
00:39:37,505 --> 00:39:40,900
Oh, well done, my child.
Nice work.

519
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:43,381
Come, [inaudible].

520
00:39:43,511 --> 00:39:45,383
[music playing]

521
00:40:00,354 --> 00:40:01,181
Excuse me.

522
00:40:17,197 --> 00:40:18,328
Let me take you home.
- Ah, no.

523
00:40:18,459 --> 00:40:19,373
Henri said...

524
00:40:19,504 --> 00:40:20,853
I don't care what Henri said.

525
00:40:20,983 --> 00:40:22,202
I'm taking you home before you fall down, OK?

526
00:40:22,332 --> 00:40:23,116
Excuse us.

527
00:40:34,388 --> 00:40:35,998
You don't know how
much I appreciate this.

528
00:40:36,129 --> 00:40:37,870
It's very gallant of you.

529
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:48,576
Well, good...

530
00:40:48,707 --> 00:40:51,449
Are you capable of
undressing on your own?

531
00:40:51,579 --> 00:40:55,975
Yes, I'm quite capable
of undressing on my own.

532
00:40:56,105 --> 00:40:59,065
You're wearing
Henri's merchandise.

533
00:40:59,195 --> 00:41:00,370
Sorry.

534
00:41:00,501 --> 00:41:03,809
I should... I'll be
back in a second.

535
00:41:03,939 --> 00:41:06,681
Oh, and thank you, for getting me out of there because I was...

536
00:41:06,812 --> 00:41:07,987
oh...

537
00:41:08,117 --> 00:41:08,901
fading fast.

538
00:41:15,821 --> 00:41:33,229
[inaudible] I thought the show went quite well.

539
00:41:36,189 --> 00:41:38,452
I was concerned what
effect a drunken model

540
00:41:38,583 --> 00:41:39,975
would make on the customers.

541
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:44,632
Hey!

542
00:41:44,763 --> 00:41:47,113
I am not drunk, I'm exhausted.

543
00:41:47,243 --> 00:41:48,984
I work my behind
off for this show.

544
00:41:49,115 --> 00:41:50,420
Then get some sleep.

545
00:41:50,551 --> 00:41:51,334
You have a photo shoot
first thing tomorrow.

546
00:41:54,947 --> 00:41:56,731
[music playing]

547
00:42:11,267 --> 00:42:13,618
Yes!

548
00:42:13,748 --> 00:42:14,575
Perfection!

549
00:42:19,188 --> 00:42:20,059
Enough.

550
00:42:20,189 --> 00:42:22,975
Thank you, my dear.

551
00:42:23,105 --> 00:42:24,803
That's all for today.

552
00:42:24,933 --> 00:42:26,413
Dominique, we do the covers now.

553
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,633
But first, we change the lighting, so take a break.

554
00:42:55,442 --> 00:42:58,880
Do you like it?

555
00:42:59,011 --> 00:43:01,883
Yeah, it shows less linear emphasis than his early work,

556
00:43:02,014 --> 00:43:04,973
and his use of light and color is much more confident.

557
00:43:07,889 --> 00:43:09,456
You certainly know what
you're talking about.

558
00:43:12,328 --> 00:43:13,373
Forgive me for
assuming you'd had

559
00:43:13,503 --> 00:43:16,681
too much to drink last night.

560
00:43:16,811 --> 00:43:21,511
It's not like I haven’t given people that impression.

561
00:43:21,642 --> 00:43:23,122
You like this collection?

562
00:43:23,252 --> 00:43:24,950
Yes, I'm write...

563
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,212
I'm reading a book on it.

564
00:43:26,342 --> 00:43:28,475
I get my thoughts
down and I compare

565
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:31,696
them with the books at home.

566
00:43:31,826 --> 00:43:34,002
Is Venetian Renaissance
art your specialty,

567
00:43:34,133 --> 00:43:36,701
or do you have broader tastes?

568
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:38,311
Such as?

569
00:43:38,441 --> 00:43:40,748
Favorite work?

570
00:43:40,879 --> 00:43:44,186
Actually Actually, something that I've never seen.

571
00:43:44,317 --> 00:43:46,101
What is it?

572
00:43:46,232 --> 00:43:47,450
It's a bronze in
the private collection

573
00:43:47,581 --> 00:43:48,843
of the Marquis de Belliveau.

574
00:43:48,974 --> 00:43:49,670
Really?

575
00:43:52,412 --> 00:43:55,067
Oh, Nick!
How nice to see you!

576
00:43:55,197 --> 00:43:56,938
Jacques?

577
00:43:57,069 --> 00:43:59,245
Congratulations.
on last evening.

578
00:43:59,375 --> 00:44:01,856
Your string of
triumphs continues.

579
00:44:01,987 --> 00:44:04,293
Thank you.

580
00:44:04,424 --> 00:44:07,732
Monsieur Claremont,
it seems our friend

581
00:44:07,862 --> 00:44:11,387
has assured that Chambertin will survive one more season.

582
00:44:11,518 --> 00:44:17,176
House of Chambertin is as solid as ever, Monsieur Henri.

583
00:44:17,306 --> 00:44:20,179
Taste is a fickle commodity.

584
00:44:20,309 --> 00:44:24,618
No one knows that better than I.

585
00:44:24,749 --> 00:44:31,190
Or I. I believe the,
uh, museum is closed

586
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,191
to the public for the day.

587
00:44:32,321 --> 00:44:34,584
Yes, so I understand.

588
00:44:34,715 --> 00:44:36,412
I, however, came
to see Dominique.

589
00:44:42,375 --> 00:44:43,245
Excuse me.

590
00:44:52,254 --> 00:44:54,996
I made a reservation
for this evening.

591
00:44:55,127 --> 00:44:58,043
8 o'clock, all right?

592
00:44:58,173 --> 00:44:59,218
Dominique?

593
00:44:59,348 --> 00:45:00,654
8:00... ah, sure.

594
00:45:00,785 --> 00:45:03,526
Um, if you'll excuse
me, Jacques, I

595
00:45:03,657 --> 00:45:05,311
have to get back to work.

596
00:45:05,441 --> 00:45:07,530
JACQUES: Don't be late.

597
00:45:07,661 --> 00:45:09,968
Your career may depend on it.

598
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:29,509
Has she changed since she came back, or is it just me?

599
00:45:29,639 --> 00:45:32,991
No, she's not the same woman.

600
00:45:33,121 --> 00:45:34,557
Not at all.

601
00:45:34,688 --> 00:45:36,516
[music playing]

602
00:45:51,009 --> 00:45:51,836
[knocking]

603
00:45:59,887 --> 00:46:00,758
[knocking]

604
00:46:06,894 --> 00:46:07,852
Hi.

605
00:46:07,982 --> 00:46:08,722
Hi.

606
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:13,379
In the 16th century,
the Marquis de

607
00:46:13,509 --> 00:46:15,381
Belleville came to
my family to borrow

608
00:46:15,511 --> 00:46:16,730
money to buy works of art.

609
00:46:16,861 --> 00:46:17,992
Came to your family...

610
00:46:18,123 --> 00:46:19,167
I... I thought that
you were American.

611
00:46:19,298 --> 00:46:20,734
Well, yeah.

612
00:46:20,865 --> 00:46:22,388
I mean, for the last couple of hundred years, sure.

613
00:46:22,518 --> 00:46:25,783
But, uh, before the revolution,we Claremonts were counts,

614
00:46:25,913 --> 00:46:27,219
dukes, whatever you want.

615
00:46:27,349 --> 00:46:31,092
I had no idea that I
was talking to royalty.

616
00:46:31,223 --> 00:46:32,746
Well, hardly.

617
00:46:32,877 --> 00:46:34,487
But you did say they had a sculpture you wanted to see.

618
00:46:39,666 --> 00:46:42,408
KIM: I've never seen so many beautiful sculptures.

619
00:46:48,066 --> 00:46:49,894
Look at this place!

620
00:46:50,024 --> 00:46:52,461
And no one here to enjoy it.

621
00:46:52,592 --> 00:46:55,073
Makes it a privilege to show it to somebody who will.

622
00:46:55,203 --> 00:46:56,117
Thank you.

623
00:46:56,248 --> 00:46:57,989
I come here a lot by myself.

624
00:46:58,119 --> 00:47:01,253
Yeah, right.

625
00:47:01,383 --> 00:47:03,777
It's true, I do!

626
00:47:03,908 --> 00:47:05,561
For 1,000 years
before the revolution,

627
00:47:05,692 --> 00:47:07,781
we Claremonts were
patrons of the arts.

628
00:47:07,912 --> 00:47:10,001
It's something I'd always wanted to get back to.

629
00:47:10,131 --> 00:47:13,395
Oh, is that why you invested in the fashion business?

630
00:47:13,526 --> 00:47:15,876
Well, yeah, I always wanted to return to Paris,

631
00:47:16,007 --> 00:47:18,096
and fashion in its
way is an art form.

632
00:47:18,226 --> 00:47:19,706
Yeah.

633
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:20,750
So I'd been led to believe the house of Chambertin

634
00:47:20,881 --> 00:47:22,100
could be profitable.

635
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:23,841
What, it's not?

636
00:47:23,971 --> 00:47:27,192
Well, Henri is a great artist,but, uh, his business sense

637
00:47:27,322 --> 00:47:29,672
is nonexistent.

638
00:47:29,803 --> 00:47:32,066
We needed a very good season.

639
00:47:32,197 --> 00:47:34,547
Needed.

640
00:47:34,677 --> 00:47:36,201
We're about to launch
the new season now.

641
00:47:39,682 --> 00:47:41,684
This morning, somebody broke into Henri's office

642
00:47:41,815 --> 00:47:45,166
while we were doing
your cover shots.

643
00:47:45,297 --> 00:47:49,388
Some sketches and the Muslims patterns were stolen.

644
00:47:49,518 --> 00:47:51,607
Why would anyone
steal his work?

645
00:47:51,738 --> 00:47:53,479
Well, it happens from time to time in this business...

646
00:47:53,609 --> 00:47:56,264
mass marketers in the Far East using his patterns.

647
00:47:56,395 --> 00:47:58,179
Before we could even
break this line,

648
00:47:58,310 --> 00:48:02,053
Henri's creations could be in hundreds of stories.

649
00:48:02,183 --> 00:48:05,273
Did you call the police?

650
00:48:05,404 --> 00:48:08,233
Publicity like
this could ruin us.

651
00:48:08,363 --> 00:48:10,975
Do you have any suspects?

652
00:48:11,105 --> 00:48:14,108
Has to be somebody
inside the firm.

653
00:48:14,239 --> 00:48:16,154
So I think they're working for Jacques Arneau.

654
00:48:16,284 --> 00:48:18,243
Arneau?

655
00:48:18,373 --> 00:48:20,506
Because of his clubs, he has access to all the right people

656
00:48:20,636 --> 00:48:23,901
and all the wrong ones.

657
00:48:24,031 --> 00:48:26,686
You don't think that I had anything to do with it.

658
00:48:26,816 --> 00:48:28,470
Not unless you can be
in two places at once.

659
00:48:28,601 --> 00:48:29,341
Nope.

660
00:48:33,475 --> 00:48:36,957
Oh, that is more beautiful than I expected.

661
00:48:41,744 --> 00:48:44,617
You know, I feel like I'm just getting to know who you are.

662
00:48:44,747 --> 00:48:46,967
Yeah, I know what you mean.

663
00:48:50,971 --> 00:48:53,452
Wanna go out for dinner?

664
00:48:53,582 --> 00:48:54,540
I can't.

665
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:56,107
I already have plans.

666
00:48:56,237 --> 00:48:57,760
Can't cancel them, huh?

667
00:48:57,891 --> 00:48:59,240
No.

668
00:48:59,371 --> 00:49:02,374
I want to.

669
00:49:02,504 --> 00:49:04,289
Maybe I can persuade you.

670
00:49:04,419 --> 00:49:08,771
Um, could you
just take me home?

671
00:49:08,902 --> 00:49:11,078
Why?

672
00:49:11,209 --> 00:49:14,560
Because there's
someone I have to see.

673
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:15,561
Sure.

674
00:49:15,691 --> 00:49:17,519
[music playing]

675
00:50:01,476 --> 00:50:02,521
Oh no, mineral water, please.

676
00:50:02,651 --> 00:50:04,958
Thank you.

677
00:50:05,089 --> 00:50:06,351
Watching my weight.

678
00:50:06,481 --> 00:50:09,223
You look enchanting
already, and no life is

679
00:50:09,354 --> 00:50:11,617
worth living without champagne.

680
00:50:11,747 --> 00:50:12,574
No, no, no.

681
00:50:16,665 --> 00:50:18,885
I should have known the
paparazzi would be here.

682
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:20,843
Dominique is on top once again.

683
00:50:25,587 --> 00:50:28,025
It would be a shame if
this fame were fleeting.

684
00:50:34,857 --> 00:50:36,294
Did you get the sketches?

685
00:50:36,424 --> 00:50:38,992
The sketches?

686
00:50:39,123 --> 00:50:40,515
I'm disappointed.

687
00:50:40,646 --> 00:50:42,082
I heard there was a problem at Chambertin today.

688
00:50:42,213 --> 00:50:45,825
I was hoping that you’d finally come through for me.

689
00:50:45,955 --> 00:50:48,306
This is what you
wanted to discuss.

690
00:50:48,436 --> 00:50:50,003
Don't play innocent.

691
00:50:50,134 --> 00:50:51,918
You weren't that drunk when I first told you about this.

692
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:57,271
And we both agreed that friends should do each other favors,

693
00:50:57,402 --> 00:51:00,187
didn't we?

694
00:51:00,318 --> 00:51:02,494
Yeah, but it's too risky.

695
00:51:02,624 --> 00:51:04,887
Philip already suspects me because of our friendship.

696
00:51:05,018 --> 00:51:06,237
He does, does he?

697
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:09,501
Maybe we should tell
him the whole story.

698
00:51:09,631 --> 00:51:12,721
My dearest Dominique...
what would he

699
00:51:12,852 --> 00:51:17,596
think if he knew that your wild evenings at my club

700
00:51:17,726 --> 00:51:20,381
could destroy the reputation of the house of Chambertin

701
00:51:20,512 --> 00:51:21,730
all by themselves?

702
00:51:25,343 --> 00:51:27,954
I doubt that he would listen to what you have to say.

703
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:33,481
True, but he will
believe his own eyes.

704
00:51:40,227 --> 00:51:41,794
Some may call that pornography.

705
00:51:41,924 --> 00:51:45,493
I prefer to think of it as art.

706
00:51:45,624 --> 00:51:48,583
Quite a night, wasn't it?

707
00:51:48,714 --> 00:51:53,066
Imagine how these would look in one of those magazines

708
00:51:53,197 --> 00:51:56,548
or on Philip's desk.

709
00:51:56,678 --> 00:51:58,550
They're fakes.

710
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:00,595
My dear, we both
know that you've

711
00:52:00,726 --> 00:52:03,120
lost entire days to the bottle.

712
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:05,600
And I was always
there, sweetheart,

713
00:52:05,731 --> 00:52:10,562
scraping you up off the floor when you couldn't move.

714
00:52:10,692 --> 00:52:14,305
I don't remember.

715
00:52:14,435 --> 00:52:16,698
Perhaps you were too drunk to remember what you were doing,

716
00:52:16,829 --> 00:52:18,787
perhaps not.

717
00:52:18,918 --> 00:52:23,227
Get me the sketches
and muslin, Cherie.

718
00:52:23,357 --> 00:52:28,101
When I get them, you get these.

719
00:52:28,232 --> 00:52:29,972
And I am prepared to
bring you down along

720
00:52:30,103 --> 00:52:31,452
with the house of Chambertin.

721
00:52:53,735 --> 00:52:55,041
SECRETARY [ON PHONE]:
Fair Oaks Clinic.

722
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:56,869
Yes, uh, Kate Jameson, please.

723
00:52:56,999 --> 00:52:58,610
It's an emergency.

724
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:00,220
SECRETARY [ON PHONE]: I'm sorry,there's no contact allowed

725
00:53:00,351 --> 00:53:01,830
for the first three weeks.

726
00:53:01,961 --> 00:53:03,484
But if you'd like
to leave a message...

727
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:04,355
No, no, no, no.

728
00:53:04,485 --> 00:53:06,095
That's too complicated.

729
00:53:06,226 --> 00:53:10,361
Please just get her to call her sister as soon as she can.

730
00:53:10,491 --> 00:53:11,231
Thank you.

731
00:53:16,497 --> 00:53:17,759
Where's Marie?

732
00:53:17,890 --> 00:53:19,935
Being questioned
by [inaudible]..

733
00:53:20,066 --> 00:53:22,416
His designs have been stolen.

734
00:53:22,547 --> 00:53:25,593
Speaking of which, have you seen Jacques Arneau lately?

735
00:53:25,724 --> 00:53:27,943
Don't bate me, Jacqueline,I'm not in the mood.

736
00:53:28,074 --> 00:53:31,338
From the screaming, it sounds like Marie is about to confess,

737
00:53:31,469 --> 00:53:33,427
whether she did it or not.

738
00:53:33,558 --> 00:53:35,212
Good.

739
00:53:35,342 --> 00:53:37,997
Maybe we'll get a cheap fitter who won't put me in polka dots.

740
00:53:41,522 --> 00:53:44,395
How can you treat
her like this?

741
00:53:44,525 --> 00:53:46,048
All right, Marie,we'll speak to you later.

742
00:53:50,836 --> 00:53:54,274
That woman has given her life to the house of Chambertin.

743
00:53:54,405 --> 00:53:57,364
Yes, she also just bought
herself a new apartment.

744
00:53:57,495 --> 00:53:58,409
So?

745
00:53:58,539 --> 00:53:59,671
Her husband died a year ago.

746
00:53:59,801 --> 00:54:01,368
He was a civil
servant who never made

747
00:54:01,499 --> 00:54:03,849
enough money in his
lifetime to buy a car,

748
00:54:03,979 --> 00:54:05,981
let alone an apartment.

749
00:54:06,112 --> 00:54:08,375
And that's enough to assume she’d destroy the only company

750
00:54:08,506 --> 00:54:09,724
she's ever worked for?

751
00:54:09,855 --> 00:54:11,857
But she just
found an apartment

752
00:54:11,987 --> 00:54:14,120
and somebody else paid for it.

753
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:15,252
I paid for it.

754
00:54:18,211 --> 00:54:19,517
You?

755
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:20,431
Yes!

756
00:54:20,561 --> 00:54:22,433
But what didn't she say?

757
00:54:22,563 --> 00:54:25,566
Why should she?
Why should I?

758
00:54:28,613 --> 00:54:30,876
How was your dinner?

759
00:54:31,006 --> 00:54:32,965
I heard you and Arneau
were together all night.

760
00:54:37,012 --> 00:54:39,450
I have done nothing to hurt the house of Chambertin.

761
00:54:46,805 --> 00:54:48,459
That woman.

762
00:54:48,589 --> 00:54:50,156
One day, you want to fire her.

763
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:52,898
The next, she's every passion you want to associate

764
00:54:53,028 --> 00:54:53,812
with your your designs.

765
00:54:56,684 --> 00:54:58,904
Henri, I think we should risk the publicity

766
00:54:59,034 --> 00:55:00,688
and go to the police.

767
00:55:00,819 --> 00:55:02,908
We'll explain these become the patterns to your creations,

768
00:55:03,038 --> 00:55:04,823
kind of a... a blueprint.

769
00:55:04,953 --> 00:55:06,955
This is not a blueprint!

770
00:55:07,086 --> 00:55:08,174
This is a vision...

771
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:10,655
a one of a kind
stroke of genius!

772
00:55:10,785 --> 00:55:11,917
Irreplaceable!

773
00:55:12,047 --> 00:55:12,918
We have to replace them.

774
00:55:13,048 --> 00:55:15,268
We have no choice.

775
00:55:15,399 --> 00:55:18,184
We can stay in business unless we market a full line

776
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:19,533
of designs this season.

777
00:55:19,664 --> 00:55:22,580
Oh yes, have another vision.

778
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:23,711
It's easy for you to say.

779
00:55:23,842 --> 00:55:24,625
Henri...

780
00:55:24,756 --> 00:55:26,671
No, no, no, no, no.

781
00:55:26,801 --> 00:55:29,456
No, it's the fate of the artist.

782
00:55:29,587 --> 00:55:31,371
I will go seek my muse.

783
00:55:31,502 --> 00:55:33,417
You just pray that I find her.

784
00:55:41,686 --> 00:55:44,341
Marie, why didn't you
tell them that Dominique

785
00:55:44,471 --> 00:55:45,733
gave you the money?

786
00:55:45,864 --> 00:55:47,735
I thought it would
make them suspect her.

787
00:55:47,866 --> 00:55:50,825
You probably would
have been right.

788
00:55:50,956 --> 00:55:53,175
They know that I didn't
steal the designs,

789
00:55:53,306 --> 00:55:56,701
but I don't know how deeply Dominique was involved.

790
00:55:56,831 --> 00:55:58,485
Meaning?

791
00:55:58,616 --> 00:56:01,270
Arneau has photos of her, the kind of photos that make you

792
00:56:01,401 --> 00:56:02,924
a little more than notorious.

793
00:56:03,055 --> 00:56:04,230
No!

794
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:05,362
She would have
agreed to do anything

795
00:56:05,492 --> 00:56:06,928
to keep them from being seen.

796
00:56:07,059 --> 00:56:08,974
And the way he saw
it, it was obvious

797
00:56:09,104 --> 00:56:10,671
he thought she'd
done it for him.

798
00:56:10,802 --> 00:56:12,456
I've always thought
that man was dangerous.

799
00:56:12,586 --> 00:56:15,110
He's a street thug with money.

800
00:56:15,241 --> 00:56:18,026
You know, there's a
rumor there is bad blood

801
00:56:18,157 --> 00:56:19,463
between him and Phillip.

802
00:56:19,593 --> 00:56:22,291
Well, whatever's
going on, I just lied

803
00:56:22,422 --> 00:56:24,032
to Phillip to cover for Kate.

804
00:56:24,163 --> 00:56:26,513
Oh!

805
00:56:26,644 --> 00:56:29,124
You're very attracted
to him, aren't you?

806
00:56:29,255 --> 00:56:30,343
Me?

807
00:56:30,474 --> 00:56:32,040
No, of course not.

808
00:56:32,171 --> 00:56:33,346
Oh, good.

809
00:56:33,477 --> 00:56:36,654
That's one less
thing to worry about.

810
00:56:36,784 --> 00:56:39,831
OK, there is a
little attraction.

811
00:56:39,961 --> 00:56:41,310
But it's not me that he sees.

812
00:56:41,441 --> 00:56:42,921
It's... it's Dominique.

813
00:56:43,051 --> 00:56:45,184
Oh?

814
00:56:45,314 --> 00:56:47,447
I knew we shouldn't have played that game again.

815
00:56:47,578 --> 00:56:48,361
Game?

816
00:56:50,711 --> 00:56:54,236
When I was 17, I met this boy, Peter Robinson.

817
00:56:54,367 --> 00:56:57,283
He was the first boy
I ever had a crush on.

818
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:59,981
He asked me out, but I had a term paper to deliver,

819
00:57:00,112 --> 00:57:02,984
so Kate took my place.

820
00:57:03,115 --> 00:57:04,595
And what happened?

821
00:57:04,725 --> 00:57:06,858
She was her usual
boisterous self,

822
00:57:06,988 --> 00:57:08,990
and he fell in love with her.

823
00:57:09,121 --> 00:57:10,557
Oh, that girl.

824
00:57:10,688 --> 00:57:13,125
KIM: After that, we never played the game again.

825
00:57:13,255 --> 00:57:16,345
This is an exclusive original.

826
00:57:16,476 --> 00:57:18,478
I can't go on a
catwalk like this.

827
00:57:18,609 --> 00:57:20,132
There is no catwalk.

828
00:57:20,262 --> 00:57:21,525
You walk among the guests.

829
00:57:26,878 --> 00:57:28,967
Oh, Jacqueline.

830
00:57:29,097 --> 00:57:31,360
Want to wear this?

831
00:57:31,491 --> 00:57:33,232
Trying to impress Phillip with your restraint?

832
00:57:50,205 --> 00:57:51,990
Oh look, Phillip
brought a lady with him.

833
00:57:57,386 --> 00:57:58,170
Lovely, isn't she?

834
00:58:05,830 --> 00:58:06,526
Turn around, please.

835
00:58:11,879 --> 00:58:14,055
What do you think, Mimi?

836
00:58:14,186 --> 00:58:16,667
It's not really
my style, Phillip.

837
00:58:16,797 --> 00:58:17,668
Thank you, Dominique.

838
00:58:22,194 --> 00:58:24,631
Dominique, I want
you to meet Mimi.

839
00:58:24,762 --> 00:58:27,460
Um, actually,
I'm on my way out.

840
00:58:27,591 --> 00:58:31,464
I'm pleased to
meet you, Dominique.

841
00:58:31,595 --> 00:58:35,294
I can never wear clothes the way you do, not even when it's just

842
00:58:35,424 --> 00:58:36,861
[inaudible].

843
00:58:36,991 --> 00:58:40,560
Dominique, my
sister, Mimi Dupre.

844
00:58:40,691 --> 00:58:42,431
Your Your sister.

845
00:58:42,562 --> 00:58:43,432
Hi there.

846
00:58:43,563 --> 00:58:44,390
It's nice to meet you.

847
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:45,565
Hi.

848
00:58:45,696 --> 00:58:47,045
You look like
a Rafael Madonna.

849
00:58:47,175 --> 00:58:48,742
When are you due?

850
00:58:48,873 --> 00:58:52,877
Well, two weeks but might just as well be two months.

851
00:58:53,007 --> 00:58:54,966
Phillip tells me you're
quite the art expert.

852
00:58:55,096 --> 00:58:56,707
Oh, hardly.
Hardly.

853
00:58:56,837 --> 00:58:58,491
Well, I'm sure
he's also told you

854
00:58:58,622 --> 00:59:00,624
that our family's had a long,uh, relationship with the arts.

855
00:59:00,754 --> 00:59:02,016
Yes, yes.

856
00:59:02,147 --> 00:59:04,323
Mimi spends much of
her time raising money

857
00:59:04,453 --> 00:59:05,759
to restore damaged paintings.

858
00:59:05,890 --> 00:59:07,500
Ah, ah!

859
00:59:07,631 --> 00:59:10,155
I thought if I can get you to host one of our fundraisers,

860
00:59:10,285 --> 00:59:12,026
it might draw some attention.

861
00:59:12,157 --> 00:59:14,812
Oh, uh... mmm...

862
00:59:14,942 --> 00:59:17,118
Oh, you know, where Dominique goes, the press follows.

863
00:59:17,249 --> 00:59:20,600
It really would help.

864
00:59:20,731 --> 00:59:22,471
Do you want to sit
down tomorrow night?

865
00:59:22,602 --> 00:59:23,864
My husband Stefan
and I are staying

866
00:59:23,995 --> 00:59:26,345
with Phillip in the city
until the baby is born.

867
00:59:26,475 --> 00:59:29,653
Please, say yes.

868
00:59:29,783 --> 00:59:31,306
Yes, yes.

869
00:59:31,437 --> 00:59:34,527
OK, I would be glad to help.

870
00:59:34,658 --> 00:59:35,528
Tomorrow evening.

871
00:59:35,659 --> 00:59:37,486
[music playing]

872
01:00:21,748 --> 01:00:23,707
What do you want now, Jacques?

873
01:00:23,837 --> 01:00:25,056
What I've always
wanted, Cheri.

874
01:00:25,186 --> 01:00:26,840
I have customers who
are getting anxious.

875
01:00:26,971 --> 01:00:29,103
Now where are those sketches?

876
01:00:29,234 --> 01:00:30,975
I told you, I don't have them.

877
01:00:36,415 --> 01:00:38,417
Don't lie to me!

878
01:00:42,029 --> 01:00:46,512
Now, I will give
you one more day,

879
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:51,648
or your career might not be the only thing I bring to an end.

880
01:00:51,778 --> 01:00:52,518
OK.

881
01:01:11,842 --> 01:01:12,669
Thank you.

882
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:26,073
Wow, this is a
stunning building.

883
01:01:26,204 --> 01:01:28,249
It's one of the last
private houses in Paris.

884
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:30,295
So how long have
you lived here?

885
01:01:30,425 --> 01:01:34,603
Well, I lived here as a child, but, uh, my father, uh,

886
01:01:34,734 --> 01:01:36,997
was unhappy here,
so we had to leave.

887
01:01:37,128 --> 01:01:40,522
It's hard to imagine
not being happy here.

888
01:01:40,653 --> 01:01:42,481
[music playing]

889
01:01:58,932 --> 01:02:00,281
MIMI: Hi!

890
01:02:00,412 --> 01:02:01,674
Hi.

891
01:02:01,805 --> 01:02:04,111
Dominique, you remember my sister, Mimi.

892
01:02:04,242 --> 01:02:05,286
Hi.

893
01:02:05,417 --> 01:02:06,461
Thank you for coming.

894
01:02:06,592 --> 01:02:07,419
I hope you'll feel at home.

895
01:02:07,549 --> 01:02:08,420
Thank you for having me.

896
01:02:08,550 --> 01:02:09,813
Of course.

897
01:02:09,943 --> 01:02:11,640
She'll be dazzled by
the meal I prepared.

898
01:02:11,771 --> 01:02:13,381
This is my husband Stefan.

899
01:02:13,512 --> 01:02:15,122
He, uh, likes to
help in the kitchen.

900
01:02:15,253 --> 01:02:17,516
I had to pay my cook
extra for the privilege.

901
01:02:17,646 --> 01:02:19,605
It's a pleasure to meet you.

902
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:20,780
Nice to meet you.

903
01:02:20,911 --> 01:02:23,391
Your home is magnificent.

904
01:02:23,522 --> 01:02:26,438
The last count de Claremont had it built in 1770.

905
01:02:26,568 --> 01:02:28,396
Our father bought

me down for sure.

Mimi, your
humility is showing.

914
01:02:56,163 --> 01:03:00,733
It comes from inbreeding and living too far from Versailles.

Yes, sorry.

01:14:54,794 --> 01:14:57,057
Your time has run out, my sweet.

1088
01:14:57,188 --> 01:14:59,190
Well, you can do whatever you want with the photographs

1089
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:00,931
because I'm going to the police.

1090
01:15:01,061 --> 01:15:03,585
JACQUES: Don't forget to tell them you took the sketches,

1091
01:15:03,716 --> 01:15:07,894
and I have a witness if you want to tell them about her.

1092
01:15:08,025 --> 01:15:10,157
What witness?

1093
01:15:10,288 --> 01:15:12,464
The newspapers will
have a field day...

1094
01:15:12,594 --> 01:15:15,467
those lurid photographs,
top model brought

1095
01:15:15,598 --> 01:15:20,124
down by her biggest rival.

1096
01:15:20,254 --> 01:15:22,518
Jacqueline.

1097
01:15:22,648 --> 01:15:24,389
This will give her everything she's always wanted.

1098
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:25,259
You're trapped.

1099
01:15:31,918 --> 01:15:36,575
It's the flip side of
the party, Dominique.

1100
01:15:36,706 --> 01:15:39,491
Now go and get me
what I asked for.

1101
01:15:50,154 --> 01:15:53,460
If what you say is
true, this is the end

1102
01:15:53,592 --> 01:15:55,594
of the house of Chambertin.

1103
01:15:55,725 --> 01:15:58,335
It's unbelievable...
all this history ruined

1104
01:15:58,466 --> 01:16:00,599
by some sordid little story.

1105
01:16:00,730 --> 01:16:04,951
Could Jacqueline
have stolen it for her?

1106
01:16:05,082 --> 01:16:06,736
She's a hungry one.

1107
01:16:06,866 --> 01:16:09,347
I've never seen anyone want a magazine cover like she does.

1108
01:16:09,477 --> 01:16:12,959
But no one would stoop that low.

1109
01:16:13,090 --> 01:16:14,091
Was she friend of Arneau's?

1110
01:16:14,221 --> 01:16:15,135
No, no.

1111
01:16:15,266 --> 01:16:16,659
She never goes to the clubs.

1112
01:16:16,789 --> 01:16:18,835
Her career is everything.

1113
01:16:18,965 --> 01:16:22,186
So what's going on
with her and Dominique?

1114
01:16:22,316 --> 01:16:24,884
You would have
to ask your sister.

1115
01:16:25,014 --> 01:16:25,755
I can't.

1116
01:16:25,885 --> 01:16:27,495
The clinic called.

1117
01:16:27,626 --> 01:16:29,236
She checked herself out and they don't know where she went.

1118
01:16:29,367 --> 01:16:32,500
That girl.

1119
01:16:32,630 --> 01:16:34,023
Well, maybe she didn't
know that these things

1120
01:16:34,154 --> 01:16:34,894
were going to happen.

1121
01:16:37,505 --> 01:16:39,943
And maybe I don't
know my sister at all.

1122
01:16:40,073 --> 01:16:43,207
And maybe you should go back to your old life.

1123
01:16:43,337 --> 01:16:45,425
These are not your problems.

1124
01:16:45,557 --> 01:16:46,993
I can't.

1125
01:16:47,124 --> 01:16:48,647
And finding out the truth is the only thing that's

1126
01:16:48,778 --> 01:16:51,432
going to save her from Arneau.

1127
01:16:51,563 --> 01:16:55,567
And maybe save
you and Phillip?

1128
01:16:55,698 --> 01:16:56,699
There's not much
chance of that.

1129
01:17:02,139 --> 01:17:03,923
Henri, what are you thinking?

1130
01:17:04,054 --> 01:17:05,359
The new collection.

1131
01:17:05,490 --> 01:17:06,709
No, no, I mean, are...
are you going somewhere?

1132
01:17:06,839 --> 01:17:08,318
Why are the drawings out?

1133
01:17:08,449 --> 01:17:10,930
Well, because I've been working on the new collection.

1134
01:17:11,061 --> 01:17:12,366
They are beautiful, yes?

1135
01:17:12,496 --> 01:17:13,889
Yes, they are.

1136
01:17:14,020 --> 01:17:15,282
I just hope we're the ones that get to sell them.

1137
01:17:15,413 --> 01:17:16,414
You know, you’re practically inviting someone

1138
01:17:16,544 --> 01:17:17,675
to come in and steal these.

1139
01:17:17,807 --> 01:17:20,723
Oh, don't be
ridiculous, Phillip.

1140
01:17:20,853 --> 01:17:25,291
A true artist cannot function in an atmosphere of paranoia.

1141
01:17:25,423 --> 01:17:27,773
Besides, I'm in a rush.

1142
01:17:27,904 --> 01:17:31,081
I have tickets for the
opera, and you know

1143
01:17:31,210 --> 01:17:32,996
I hate to miss the overture.

1144
01:17:33,126 --> 01:17:36,303
So I go!

1145
01:17:36,434 --> 01:17:38,262
Henri.

Ah, wait here, please.

1148
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:57,541
Thank you.

1150
01:18:18,432 --> 01:18:20,521
Hello there.

1151
01:18:20,652 --> 01:18:24,090
I'm looking for
Jacqueline le Claire.

1152
01:18:24,221 --> 01:18:24,960
Mama!

1153
01:18:31,445 --> 01:18:33,099
What are you doing here?

1154
01:18:33,230 --> 01:18:35,188
We need to talk.

1155
01:18:35,318 --> 01:18:36,494
Wait for me in the front room.

1156
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:42,805
Mommy needs to
talk to this lady.

1157
01:18:46,373 --> 01:18:48,419
Come on, let's go
to your room, OK?

1158
01:19:00,518 --> 01:19:03,651
Your son's a
beautiful little boy.

1159
01:19:03,782 --> 01:19:06,175
What do you want?

1160
01:19:06,306 --> 01:19:09,048
You have something
which belongs to Henri.

1161
01:19:09,179 --> 01:19:10,746
What makes you think that?

1162
01:19:10,876 --> 01:19:12,791
Jacques told me.

1163
01:19:12,922 --> 01:19:15,272
Why would you do
something like this?

1164
01:19:15,402 --> 01:19:16,969
Don't pretend you don't know.

1165
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:18,710
I don't know.

1166
01:19:18,841 --> 01:19:20,625
You You had told
him about my past.

1167
01:19:20,755 --> 01:19:23,323
He's blackmailed me ever since.

1168
01:19:23,454 --> 01:19:24,585
I never told him anything.

1169
01:19:32,463 --> 01:19:33,725
Does he have something
like that on you?

1170
01:19:45,476 --> 01:19:47,565
He's playing us
off of each other.

1171
01:19:47,695 --> 01:19:48,827
Yes.

1172
01:19:48,958 --> 01:19:50,873
He finds your weakness
and exploits it.

1173
01:19:51,003 --> 01:19:52,309
With you, it was your drinking.

1174
01:19:52,439 --> 01:19:55,398
With me, it was what I
came to care for my son.

1175
01:19:55,529 --> 01:20:00,447
There were so many men offering money, and my son needed food.

1176
01:20:00,577 --> 01:20:01,318
I was all alone.

1177
01:20:10,893 --> 01:20:12,329
I was desperate.

1178
01:20:12,459 --> 01:20:14,287
I... I thought if I
took the drawings

1179
01:20:14,418 --> 01:20:16,637
and told Jacques you had them...

1180
01:20:16,768 --> 01:20:18,901
That it would
finish my career.

1181
01:20:19,031 --> 01:20:21,425
I thought maybe that
would be the end of it.

1182
01:20:21,555 --> 01:20:22,556
He'd have beaten Phillip.

1183
01:20:22,687 --> 01:20:23,949
That's what he really wants.

1184
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:25,298
Why?

1185
01:20:25,429 --> 01:20:27,170
His parents worked
for the Claremonts

1186
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:31,000
until Philip's mother ran off with Jacques' father.

1187
01:20:31,130 --> 01:20:34,046
Without his father, Jacques' family sank into poverty.

1188
01:20:34,177 --> 01:20:38,007
He's always blamed the Claremonts for what happened.

1189
01:20:38,137 --> 01:20:39,530
You'll have to return these.

1190
01:20:39,660 --> 01:20:40,835
I can't!

1191
01:20:40,966 --> 01:20:41,924
It was hard enough
getting them out.

1192
01:20:42,054 --> 01:20:43,403
No, it's impossible!

1193
01:20:43,534 --> 01:20:44,796
Yes you can.

1194
01:20:44,927 --> 01:20:45,841
You just walk in there,
you put them back,

1195
01:20:45,971 --> 01:20:47,146
and you walk back out again.

1196
01:20:47,277 --> 01:20:48,626
I can't fight him.

1197
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:56,242
Wait.

1198
01:20:56,373 --> 01:20:57,460
This won't stop him.

1199
01:20:57,591 --> 01:20:58,941
I'll handle Jacques.

1201
01:21:16,349 --> 01:21:17,785
Hi, Paul.

1202
01:21:17,916 --> 01:21:19,875
I'm just locking
up, Miss Dominique.

1203
01:21:20,005 --> 01:21:22,007
Um, I forgot my earrings.

1204
01:21:22,138 --> 01:21:24,009
Just a second?

1205
01:21:24,139 --> 01:21:26,446
All right.

01:21:58,434 --> 01:22:01,525
I'm returning the sketches.

1208

Having taken the opportunity to copy them, no doubt.

1209
01:22:04,963 --> 01:22:06,356
No.

I'm returning the
sketches for someone

1211
01:22:08,184 --> 01:22:13,058
who took them and regretted taking them afterward.

1212
01:22:13,189 --> 01:22:13,929
Who?

1213
01:22:17,976 --> 01:22:20,326
I can't say.

1214
01:22:20,457 --> 01:22:21,414
Oh, of course not.

1215
01:22:21,545 --> 01:22:23,068
Tell me.

1216
01:22:23,199 --> 01:22:24,678
How much is your friend Jacques paying you to do this?

1217
01:22:24,809 --> 01:22:26,550
Philip, I didn't steal them.

1218
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:28,856
Stop lying to me.

1219
01:22:28,987 --> 01:22:31,032
I'm not lying to you.

This cafe has inspired artists for centuries, all the greats.

1227
01:23:15,991 --> 01:23:18,558
It's fitting you should choose for my latest triumph.

1228
01:23:18,689 --> 01:23:21,952
I've never really thought of you as an artist, Jacques.

1229
01:23:22,084 --> 01:23:24,737
You are the clay in
my hands, Dominique.

1230

Why?

1236
01:23:38,665 --> 01:23:41,886
Because I'm not afraid of your photographs or your threats?

Because I'm not afraid
of a low life pimp?

You see, I don't
think it's the sketches

want because that's

would you help her?

1255

She hates everything about you.

Well, that's the deal.

being threatened, is it?

01:25:22,639 --> 01:25:24,031
Dominique!

1265
01:25:24,162 --> 01:25:25,772
Dominique!

1266
01:25:25,903 --> 01:25:26,730
You're finished!

1267
01:25:26,860 --> 01:25:27,948
Do you hear me?

1268
01:25:28,079 --> 01:25:28,906
You are finished!

1269
01:25:34,041 --> 01:25:36,130
Don't tempt me, Dominique.

1270
01:25:36,261 --> 01:25:40,918
Give me those sketches or I will ruin your career.

1271
01:25:41,048 --> 01:25:42,180
HENRI: Dominique!

1272
01:25:42,311 --> 01:25:43,877
Come in.

1273
01:25:44,008 --> 01:25:47,272
Jacqueline has just
told me everything.

1274
01:25:47,403 --> 01:25:49,318
I couldn't let
you take the blame.

1275
01:25:49,448 --> 01:25:50,493
Thanks.

1276
01:25:50,623 --> 01:25:52,625
You were both of
you very foolish

1277
01:25:52,755 --> 01:25:54,932
not to tell me
what was going on.

1278
01:25:55,062 --> 01:25:57,543
I always look after my girls!

1279
01:25:57,674 --> 01:25:59,675
And if Arneau had
made any trouble,

1280
01:25:59,806 --> 01:26:02,896
well, I think my
contacts with the press

1281
01:26:03,027 --> 01:26:04,637
are more powerful than his.

1282
01:26:04,768 --> 01:26:08,163
I am owed a great
number of favors.

1283
01:26:08,293 --> 01:26:11,644
Well, I think
that this will help.

1284
01:26:11,775 --> 01:26:13,777
Jacques admitted everything.

1285
01:26:13,907 --> 01:26:14,778
Dominique!

1286
01:26:14,907 --> 01:26:17,041
Where are you going?

1287
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:20,087
You have to give
Philip the news.

1288
01:26:20,218 --> 01:26:21,654
I think he'd rather
hear that from you.

1289
01:26:37,366 --> 01:26:38,541
Who's there?

1290
01:26:38,671 --> 01:26:41,457
Hey, Kim.

1291
01:26:41,587 --> 01:26:44,895
Oh, looking good!

1292
01:26:45,025 --> 01:26:46,375
It suites you.

1293
01:26:46,505 --> 01:26:47,941
What are you doing here?

1294
01:26:48,072 --> 01:26:49,508
And why did you
leave the clinic?

1295
01:26:49,639 --> 01:26:51,335
I read about the
new line in the paper

1296
01:26:51,467 --> 01:26:52,816
and I didn't want you
to deal with Arneau,

1297
01:26:52,946 --> 01:26:55,253
so I came back to take over.

1298
01:26:55,384 --> 01:26:56,950
Well, it's too late.

1299
01:26:57,081 --> 01:26:59,823
He was here all along.

1300
01:26:59,952 --> 01:27:01,346
It's OK.

1301
01:27:01,477 --> 01:27:02,956
We'll talk about it later.

1302
01:27:03,087 --> 01:27:06,438
Now how are you doing
with the program?

1303
01:27:06,568 --> 01:27:09,702
Let's just say that I had sometime to look at who I'd become.

1304
01:27:13,576 --> 01:27:16,883
I'm sorry.

1305
01:27:17,014 --> 01:27:19,582
Promise me you'll
continue treatment.

1306
01:27:19,712 --> 01:27:21,496
I've already looked
into a clinic here,

1307
01:27:21,627 --> 01:27:22,628
and I start next week.

1308
01:27:26,327 --> 01:27:28,068
Anyone find us out?

1309
01:27:28,199 --> 01:27:29,722
Only Marie, but
she covered for us.

1310
01:27:32,550 --> 01:27:34,335
Well, if there's
one thing I've learned

1311
01:27:34,466 --> 01:27:35,989
these past few weeks,
it's that I have

1312
01:27:36,120 --> 01:27:38,644
to be honest about who I am.

1313
01:27:38,775 --> 01:27:42,648
So tomorrow, we'll go in and I’ll tell them the truth.

1314
01:27:42,779 --> 01:27:44,737
No, I, uh...

1315
01:27:44,868 --> 01:27:46,130
I'm going to call
and thank Marie,

1316
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:50,264
but I'm taking the first
flight out of here.

1317
01:27:50,395 --> 01:27:51,353
She what?

1318
01:27:51,483 --> 01:27:53,050
She's going home to America.

1319
01:27:53,180 --> 01:27:55,531
I could not talk her out of it.

1320
01:27:55,661 --> 01:27:56,662
What time is she leaving?

1321
01:27:56,793 --> 01:27:58,969
I don't know, but
she said she had

1322
01:27:59,099 --> 01:28:00,884
time to say goodbye to Paris.

1323
01:28:17,248 --> 01:28:18,597
[knocking]

1324
01:28:20,251 --> 01:28:21,121
[knocking]

1325
01:28:21,252 --> 01:28:23,341
Dominique!

1326
01:28:23,472 --> 01:28:24,951
You can't leave!
- Phillip...

1327
01:28:25,082 --> 01:28:26,300
Look, you've got to give me a chance to apologize.

1328
01:28:26,431 --> 01:28:28,128
- Phillip...
- I need you!

1329
01:28:28,259 --> 01:28:29,478
Phillip!

1330
01:28:29,608 --> 01:28:30,522
Look, I know that
night in my apartment.

1331
01:28:30,653 --> 01:28:31,871
meant something to both of us...

1332
01:28:32,002 --> 01:28:33,395
Oh, Phillip, you
better stop right there.

1333
01:28:33,525 --> 01:28:35,614
I am not the woman
that you think I am.

1334
01:28:45,189 --> 01:28:46,059
Hey, buddy!

1335
01:28:46,190 --> 01:28:47,017
Watch where you're going!

1336
01:28:47,147 --> 01:28:48,496
Damn Frenchmen!

1337
01:29:07,516 --> 01:29:08,821
Dominique told
me what you did.

1338
01:29:08,952 --> 01:29:10,606
I was crazy enough to trust you.

1339
01:29:10,736 --> 01:29:11,520
Yeah, you were.

1340
01:29:18,440 --> 01:29:20,355
It's just like I told, hun.

1341
01:29:20,485 --> 01:29:22,574
French... they ain't like us.

1342
01:29:22,705 --> 01:29:23,445
I know.

1343
01:29:27,666 --> 01:29:28,972
You know what?

1344
01:29:29,102 --> 01:29:30,234
You're going to have
to marry me so we

1345
01:29:30,365 --> 01:29:32,148
can work on this every day.

1346
01:29:32,279 --> 01:29:33,977
Don't you think you need to know the name of the girl

1347
01:29:34,107 --> 01:29:35,108
before you marry her?

1348
01:29:35,239 --> 01:29:38,373
