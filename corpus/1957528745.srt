1
00:04:49,116 --> 00:04:51,085
Hello, can you hear me?

2
00:04:51,185 --> 00:04:53,281
He comes tonight.

3
00:05:04,144 --> 00:05:05,214
Julija!

4
00:05:05,554 --> 00:05:08,082
Julija, the cord.

5
00:05:11,082 --> 00:05:13,886
If he stays, we'll see
the terrain tomorrow.

6
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:18,318
That's right.

7
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:20,198
We need to take care of it.

8
00:05:22,053 --> 00:05:23,784
I call him.

9
00:05:25,093 --> 00:05:26,596
OK Bye.

10
00:05:28,803 --> 00:05:30,269
Julija, the cord.

11
00:05:33,964 --> 00:05:36,085
This is a private dock!

12
00:05:36,848 --> 00:05:39,180
You can anchor the boat in my bag!

13
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,320
Turkey.

14
00:05:59,524 --> 00:06:01,173
He comes tonight.

15
00:06:02,849 --> 00:06:05,029
He knows where is best for him.

16
00:06:08,049 --> 00:06:09,274
Do you have wine?

17
00:06:10,946 --> 00:06:11,946
Plavac.

18
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:20,532
Plavac, but good.

19
00:06:23,471 --> 00:06:25,347
The one we drink at Easter.

20
00:06:26,962 --> 00:06:29,390
Delivered here until 14:00.

21
00:06:42,633 --> 00:06:43,932
Did you take anything?

22
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,760
Murina.

23
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:50,579
Thank God. Help me with this.

24
00:06:51,234 --> 00:06:53,473
I can't take any more orders today.

25
00:06:56,119 --> 00:06:58,908
I know. Please be patient.

26
00:07:02,195 --> 00:07:04,059
Tonight is important.

27
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:10,332
What was there?

28
00:07:11,168 --> 00:07:12,372
Any.

29
00:07:18,649 --> 00:07:19,741
Look.

30
00:07:21,738 --> 00:07:23,906
I wore this before you were born.

31
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,201
It's beautiful.

32
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,436
- In it!
- I'm going!

33
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,418
- Come clean the fish!
- All right.

34
00:07:40,689 --> 00:07:41,496
It's this one?

35
00:07:41,596 --> 00:07:43,854
Go wear what daddy tells you to

36
00:07:45,144 --> 00:07:48,570
Javier is coming. Your
father will be in a good mood.

37
00:08:01,533 --> 00:08:02,720
What is it?

38
00:08:03,325 --> 00:08:06,281
Just some old stuff. Am I
no longer allowed to wear?

39
00:08:06,381 --> 00:08:10,002
- Let me go!
- What is it?

40
00:08:45,071 --> 00:08:47,731
She bit into her own flesh to free herself.

41
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:54,442
You're going to buy an apartment
in Zagreb for your kids' college.

42
00:08:55,419 --> 00:08:59,236
This man who comes to my
house tonight is God on Earth.

43
00:08:59,336 --> 00:09:00,648
I know.

44
00:09:01,095 --> 00:09:03,663
We just need to make him happy.

45
00:09:05,644 --> 00:09:07,902
Meet us tomorrow at 11 am in Mana.

46
00:09:08,421 --> 00:09:09,983
- At 11 am.
- Right.

47
00:09:11,701 --> 00:09:12,515
What is it?

48
00:09:12,615 --> 00:09:15,525
- Ivo let you take his boat.
- Thanks.

49
00:09:17,465 --> 00:09:20,068
Julija, go wash the chairs.

50
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,889
Stop playing with the water.

51
00:10:29,798 --> 00:10:30,798
Here.

52
00:10:32,824 --> 00:10:35,153
- How much is it?
- $350.

53
00:10:40,486 --> 00:10:42,924
Your daughter walks
around naked to provoke.

54
00:10:43,024 --> 00:10:44,575
- She's covered.
- Right.

55
00:10:50,624 --> 00:10:52,708
In it, what wine is this?

56
00:10:53,217 --> 00:10:55,068
- Plavac.
- Blayer?

57
00:10:55,886 --> 00:10:57,730
What wine does Javier drink?

58
00:10:58,009 --> 00:11:00,776
- Plavac.
- Which?

59
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:05,092
- Tell me, which one?
- I do not know.

60
00:11:05,192 --> 00:11:08,543
Tell me which Plavac does Javier like?

61
00:12:14,028 --> 00:12:16,644
Julija, is that you?

62
00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:26,710
Julija!

63
00:12:38,696 --> 00:12:39,911
Beautiful, like your mother.

64
00:12:40,011 --> 00:12:42,035
Alberto, Nela's daughter.

65
00:12:42,585 --> 00:12:44,898
- Albert.
- Javi!

66
00:12:45,351 --> 00:12:46,556
In view of!

67
00:12:47,532 --> 00:12:49,808
Martin, you will love this place.

68
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:22,356
- Before...
- Javi.

69
00:13:23,523 --> 00:13:24,685
Longing.

70
00:13:28,905 --> 00:13:30,124
Hi, Javi.

71
00:13:31,582 --> 00:13:32,980
Good to see you.

72
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,365
Carla, Martin.

73
00:13:37,755 --> 00:13:41,480
- This is Nela, you know her.
- I remember. Thanks for coming.

74
00:13:43,842 --> 00:13:47,522
What are you doing
naked? Go get dressed. Fast!

75
00:13:47,622 --> 00:13:52,977
Julija, a little gift from New York.

76
00:13:53,336 --> 00:13:55,265
Smile, you beast, what does it cost you?

77
00:13:58,021 --> 00:14:01,984
- Thanks.
- No present for Ante. He already has everything.

78
00:14:02,678 --> 00:14:03,939
Thank you, Javi.

79
00:14:06,252 --> 00:14:07,361
I really have.

80
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:39,723
Our! It's beautiful!

81
00:14:41,055 --> 00:14:42,317
I am fine?

82
00:14:43,937 --> 00:14:45,373
Was it good?

83
00:14:50,021 --> 00:14:51,414
put it on

84
00:14:52,397 --> 00:14:54,577
- I don't want it, it's yours.
- It's elegant.

85
00:14:54,677 --> 00:14:57,851
- It does not matter.
- Just today. Trust in me.

86
00:14:58,358 --> 00:15:02,022
If your father sells the land,
we can move to Zagreb.

87
00:15:05,475 --> 00:15:06,475
Let's go.

88
00:16:43,036 --> 00:16:45,333
- How is it going? How is he?
- He is well.

89
00:16:45,433 --> 00:16:46,601
Drambuie.

90
00:16:48,316 --> 00:16:49,621
Where's Drambuie?

91
00:16:50,554 --> 00:16:52,423
Where the fuck?

92
00:17:00,584 --> 00:17:01,792
This one.

93
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,111
Cups.

94
00:17:05,132 --> 00:17:06,225
I am going home.

95
00:17:10,134 --> 00:17:11,138
Javi...

96
00:17:12,876 --> 00:17:17,709
I want to say how happy I am to
have you here after seven years.

97
00:17:20,376 --> 00:17:24,538
And I'm proud to host your friends.

98
00:17:26,716 --> 00:17:32,092
And that your dinner at my house
will be the last stop on your journey.

99
00:17:33,996 --> 00:17:36,525
I made many mistakes in my life,

100
00:17:36,703 --> 00:17:40,524
but that friendship has always
been one of the greatest... gifts.

101
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:45,956
I missed you, man.

102
00:17:47,283 --> 00:17:49,361
I missed you.

103
00:17:50,751 --> 00:17:56,247
Ante... He was the best captain I ever had.

104
00:17:56,647 --> 00:18:01,097
We met very young and
went on very crazy adventures.

105
00:18:01,454 --> 00:18:04,800
I cannot speak for the majority
in front of such polite company.

106
00:18:10,267 --> 00:18:15,014
I love this man like a
brother. Long live love.

107
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:21,337
And as for my father's boat you sunk...

108
00:18:22,428 --> 00:18:23,706
I forgive you.

109
00:18:29,404 --> 00:18:30,819
Julija, levante-se!

110
00:18:31,317 --> 00:18:33,992
Get up and recite the poem I wrote for you!

111
00:18:35,191 --> 00:18:36,413
They don't want to hear it now.

112
00:18:36,513 --> 00:18:38,505
I wrote this poem for you.

113
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:42,697
- Before, not now.
- Why not?

114
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,438
Let's go.

115
00:19:13,582 --> 00:19:16,013
I sit on the shore looking at you

116
00:19:18,586 --> 00:19:21,115
Looking from afar where you become the sky

117
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:26,392
How can I count all the paths and
waves you create with the wind?

118
00:19:27,172 --> 00:19:29,203
I look into your blue depths

119
00:19:29,303 --> 00:19:31,544
What secrets do you hide?

120
00:19:31,862 --> 00:19:34,284
These are the colours that seduce sailors

121
00:19:34,384 --> 00:19:36,789
when someone stays in their stillness?

122
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,514
See you in your bad temper

123
00:19:44,778 --> 00:19:46,722
And I don't trust you

124
00:19:49,567 --> 00:19:52,383
Sea, I don't know how to understand you

125
00:19:59,315 --> 00:20:01,608
In front of you, the sea, I am speechless

126
00:20:06,758 --> 00:20:12,398
She skipped the line! She missed
the best part about her father.

127
00:20:13,131 --> 00:20:18,893
"And when you're at peace,
there's one thing I ask.

128
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:24,619
You have no right to take my father,
you must always bring him back."

129
00:20:26,712 --> 00:20:29,216
- Now say good night.
- Enjoy your night.

130
00:22:13,481 --> 00:22:15,105
It's good that they're away.

131
00:22:15,988 --> 00:22:18,446
Imagine going through
this with the kids at home.

132
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:22,965
I do not know. Is he blind.

133
00:22:37,451 --> 00:22:38,768
For old times' sake.

134
00:22:46,893 --> 00:22:50,063
See that island? I call it Nela's belly.

135
00:22:51,354 --> 00:22:53,007
Well, he feeds me well.

136
00:22:53,107 --> 00:22:54,853
I'm a good fisherman.

137
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:58,507
- It's my best catch.
- Ante wins again.

138
00:23:00,167 --> 00:23:03,196
- How long will he stay?
- As long as you need.

139
00:23:05,213 --> 00:23:08,518
He's here on business,
not to see you misbehave.

140
00:23:13,878 --> 00:23:16,222
Did you know your mother
won a beauty contest?

141
00:23:17,256 --> 00:23:19,785
Yeah, we sailed the
islands before you were born.

142
00:23:19,885 --> 00:23:23,034
She wasn't even registered,
they pulled her out of the audience.

143
00:23:23,134 --> 00:23:24,882
That was a long time ago.

144
00:23:24,982 --> 00:23:27,213
It hasn't been that long.

145
00:23:28,587 --> 00:23:30,872
What if Pavo doesn't sell the land?

146
00:23:31,357 --> 00:23:33,448
You left the fenders in the water.

147
00:23:54,736 --> 00:23:57,622
Amazing, huh? Julija!

148
00:24:01,212 --> 00:24:05,412
The land of Pavo is
from here to the pine tree.

149
00:24:05,942 --> 00:24:10,909
And ours is from the tree on
the right to the end of the bay.

150
00:24:11,009 --> 00:24:11,829
Very good.

151
00:24:11,929 --> 00:24:16,224
The ideal is to have two
lots to build a beautiful resort.

152
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,839
Why don't we take a shortcut over there?

153
00:24:19,218 --> 00:24:21,377
He's already broken a boat like that.

154
00:24:23,092 --> 00:24:24,608
Who broke the boat?

155
00:24:26,704 --> 00:24:29,163
Another adventure without me, huh?

156
00:24:31,307 --> 00:24:34,512
Julija, go through the channel.

157
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:39,222
- The tide is low.
- I told you to go through the stones.

158
00:24:41,707 --> 00:24:43,370
Sit with me.

159
00:24:46,937 --> 00:24:49,635
That's how I remember your father.

160
00:25:04,164 --> 00:25:06,097
It's less than a meter to the left.

161
00:25:10,314 --> 00:25:13,701
There's a big rock on the left! Go hit her!

162
00:25:17,772 --> 00:25:22,152
- There's a big rock on the left!
- I don't need your help!

163
00:25:43,407 --> 00:25:44,869
Who sank the boat?

164
00:25:47,663 --> 00:25:48,988
Have nothing to say?

165
00:25:49,088 --> 00:25:51,887
Remember, this is how we sailed in Kalaman?

166
00:25:52,479 --> 00:25:54,494
- I asked you something.
- Leave her.

167
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:56,926
- Before.
- Leave her.

168
00:26:04,638 --> 00:26:07,817
Next time, think twice
before saying something.

169
00:26:13,383 --> 00:26:17,274
- What are you doing?
- She's the best swimmer.

170
00:26:22,299 --> 00:26:24,035
Who is the best captain?

171
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,250
Are you okay?

172
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:37,276
I am well.

173
00:26:39,127 --> 00:26:43,058
Javi, don't swim all!

174
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:48,135
I will anchor on the other side!

175
00:27:17,473 --> 00:27:20,798
You know where I come from,

176
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:27,498
if a boy swims from one island
to another, he becomes a man.

177
00:27:28,828 --> 00:27:30,652
Maybe we should try.

178
00:27:31,247 --> 00:27:33,775
I don't like it when I don't
know what's beneath me.

179
00:27:41,212 --> 00:27:44,622
If you need to know everything beforehand,
you will never leave this island.

180
00:27:45,052 --> 00:27:46,647
I never said I wanted to go out.

181
00:27:48,532 --> 00:27:49,832
So, you are good?

182
00:27:52,791 --> 00:27:57,827
I'm diving tomorrow, deep, 40 meters.

183
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:01,268
There is a beautiful blue light.

184
00:28:01,893 --> 00:28:05,795
Very pretty, but you can't
see it from the surface.

185
00:28:11,518 --> 00:28:14,728
So, is that why you're here? By blue light?

186
00:28:16,805 --> 00:28:21,032
You're out of shape, old man! She won you.

187
00:28:22,112 --> 00:28:23,544
Well done, Julija!

188
00:28:27,228 --> 00:28:29,189
Hey, this is the terrain. Comes.

189
00:28:34,667 --> 00:28:36,256
How far is it from Italy?

190
00:28:37,411 --> 00:28:41,984
That's the best part
of it all. Four o'clock.

191
00:28:42,393 --> 00:28:45,637
And the Italian coast sucks.

192
00:28:47,697 --> 00:28:51,865
This will be paradise for Italians.

193
00:28:52,549 --> 00:28:54,398
- Look this.
- Look at him.

194
00:28:55,423 --> 00:28:56,972
He needs it.

195
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:01,005
If he can do that, he'll be calmer.

196
00:29:01,105 --> 00:29:03,381
If he makes money, it will get worse.

197
00:29:09,183 --> 00:29:10,931
How are they friends?

198
00:29:12,308 --> 00:29:14,434
They met when they were young.

199
00:29:20,974 --> 00:29:23,726
People like Javi don't
have many friends like that.

200
00:29:24,597 --> 00:29:29,884
We keep the other side of the
island in the open sea. Free for boats.

201
00:29:31,302 --> 00:29:35,900
And Pavo is somewhere here, waiting for us.

202
00:29:37,274 --> 00:29:39,905
Good, good, very good.

203
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:44,287
Hello? Where is he?

204
00:29:45,473 --> 00:29:47,116
It's not today.

205
00:29:48,607 --> 00:29:50,367
I told you five times!

206
00:29:52,051 --> 00:29:53,440
What an idiot!

207
00:29:53,803 --> 00:29:55,286
Cum!

208
00:29:55,406 --> 00:29:58,147
I bring money to his door and he is late.

209
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:22,169
His bones turned to ash in seconds.

210
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:26,442
They were only a couple
of years older than me.

211
00:30:31,912 --> 00:30:33,557
Pavo will be late.

212
00:30:46,819 --> 00:30:49,583
It's useless to come home
when we've come this far.

213
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,386
Do not stress yourself.

214
00:30:53,647 --> 00:30:55,364
I'm going to fish our dinner.

215
00:31:03,073 --> 00:31:04,966
Julija, let's go!

216
00:31:05,213 --> 00:31:06,285
I will stay.

217
00:31:10,897 --> 00:31:16,117
In it, just loosen the rope and
attach the anchor if the wind changes.

218
00:31:51,995 --> 00:31:55,169
Are you hungry? I can get some sea urchins.

219
00:31:55,269 --> 00:31:56,455
Starving.

220
00:31:57,723 --> 00:31:59,813
I'll get the knife and bread from the boat.

221
00:31:59,913 --> 00:32:02,418
Mom, wait! I'll.

222
00:33:55,642 --> 00:33:56,850
He likes you.

223
00:34:16,818 --> 00:34:19,559
It's taking a while, where's Ante?

224
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:22,644
He must still be looking for a murine.

225
00:34:28,584 --> 00:34:32,926
We can sail away, leave
him here, fishing for murine.

226
00:34:37,567 --> 00:34:40,150
My mother got dressed for you last night.

227
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:42,147
She changed her clothes a few times.

228
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,765
Here it is.

229
00:34:56,571 --> 00:34:58,818
I asked your mother to marry me.

230
00:34:59,386 --> 00:35:01,049
- What is...
- When?

231
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:05,792
- Aren't we going to tell the truth?
- I won't comment on that.

232
00:35:06,392 --> 00:35:10,454
- Where are you going?
- I will never go back

233
00:35:10,646 --> 00:35:11,903
- Nelita, come back here.
- No!

234
00:35:12,003 --> 00:35:13,635
- Come here.
- No, no.

235
00:35:14,438 --> 00:35:16,819
Wait, wait there.

236
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:19,699
Look this.

237
00:35:25,348 --> 00:35:27,835
Leave now, if you dare.

238
00:35:46,076 --> 00:35:47,501
No, no, no...

239
00:35:51,148 --> 00:35:52,617
- Come on.
- No.

240
00:35:53,118 --> 00:35:56,994
Julija, your mother forgot how to dance.

241
00:36:05,832 --> 00:36:06,922
Come on, mom.

242
00:36:30,168 --> 00:36:31,901
Come, mother.

243
00:37:14,961 --> 00:37:16,036
Dad is back.

244
00:37:21,463 --> 00:37:22,606
In view of!

245
00:37:31,908 --> 00:37:33,230
What was there?

246
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:36,487
I went to the other side and got stuck.

247
00:37:42,107 --> 00:37:44,810
Fuck it, Javi. The big boat caught it all.

248
00:37:44,937 --> 00:37:46,481
Little fishes.

249
00:37:53,537 --> 00:37:56,685
Stop looking at him like
that. It looks like you're in love.

250
00:37:59,412 --> 00:38:02,573
Pavo had to go to Split,
he'll meet us tomorrow.

251
00:38:07,957 --> 00:38:09,350
Don't grab my foot.

252
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:12,791
It's my foot! Fight, Nela, fight!

253
00:38:16,354 --> 00:38:17,466
Lute!

254
00:38:21,704 --> 00:38:23,541
Fuck, Julija!

255
00:38:29,287 --> 00:38:30,489
Let's go!

256
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:34,088
Team change!

257
00:38:36,005 --> 00:38:38,419
- Julija, are you ready?
- I am.

258
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:49,971
Never give up! Never give up!

259
00:38:59,486 --> 00:39:01,403
In it, you're letting them win!

260
00:39:01,609 --> 00:39:02,812
That hurts!

261
00:39:04,603 --> 00:39:07,158
Let me go! You will break my leg.

262
00:39:14,447 --> 00:39:17,234
Javi, Javi.

263
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,366
Is that blood?

264
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:22,918
- Hey.
- I am fine.

265
00:39:23,924 --> 00:39:25,053
Let me see.

266
00:39:44,013 --> 00:39:46,212
- This will stop the bleeding.
- Thanks.

267
00:39:47,833 --> 00:39:49,106
Perfect.

268
00:39:57,676 --> 00:39:58,882
Are you okay?

269
00:40:00,149 --> 00:40:01,434
Are you okay?

270
00:40:06,733 --> 00:40:08,356
The eyes never lie.

271
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:45,403
I wasn't flirting.

272
00:40:45,503 --> 00:40:47,671
In it, you showed him a necklace like this.

273
00:40:48,699 --> 00:40:50,380
- So?
- I was 17.

274
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,322
- Almost 18.
- I remember that.

275
00:40:52,422 --> 00:40:56,836
Turns out Nela showed
us her favourite jewellery.

276
00:40:58,493 --> 00:41:02,066
Then I bought everything
she liked and gave it to her.

277
00:41:02,166 --> 00:41:04,441
And then, I was fired.
That is what happened.

278
00:41:04,541 --> 00:41:08,874
And then we all went sailing.

279
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:13,311
Good times.

280
00:41:16,848 --> 00:41:19,894
It's not murine, but tomorrow
Julija will get you one.

281
00:41:19,994 --> 00:41:21,012
Do you do spearfishing?

282
00:41:21,112 --> 00:41:23,723
She loves it, she comes
with me every morning.

283
00:41:24,368 --> 00:41:27,036
Huntress and beautiful, like her mother.

284
00:41:27,827 --> 00:41:30,795
You can have anything
you want in life, Julija.

285
00:41:31,017 --> 00:41:32,630
That's my girl.

286
00:41:33,735 --> 00:41:35,370
I hate spearfishing.

287
00:41:36,503 --> 00:41:37,895
I like to dive.

288
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:40,227
You like it when you
come home with a catch.

289
00:41:40,327 --> 00:41:42,272
No, I like diving.

290
00:41:43,352 --> 00:41:46,242
Once I was underwater for 5m 20s.

291
00:41:46,342 --> 00:41:48,895
She won a medal in
the national competition.

292
00:41:50,744 --> 00:41:53,082
Now I understand why
you want to sell your land.

293
00:41:53,182 --> 00:41:54,314
Why?

294
00:41:55,121 --> 00:41:57,990
If he sells the land, we
buy an apartment in Zagreb.

295
00:41:59,773 --> 00:42:01,697
Which is! You must go to Harvard.

296
00:42:01,797 --> 00:42:03,925
- Harvard?
- That.

297
00:42:04,344 --> 00:42:06,935
Look at her, they would
do anything to have her.

298
00:42:07,035 --> 00:42:08,537
She grew up in paradise.

299
00:42:08,637 --> 00:42:11,359
Girls like her get pregnant soon,

300
00:42:11,459 --> 00:42:13,395
and you know it as well as I do.

301
00:42:13,495 --> 00:42:14,611
In view of...

302
00:42:17,563 --> 00:42:19,489
Julija, help me with dessert.

303
00:42:20,434 --> 00:42:21,830
I'd love to go.

304
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:22,967
That's great.

305
00:42:23,067 --> 00:42:26,624
Don't destroy her dreams, Javi.
She is already larger than life.

306
00:42:26,724 --> 00:42:29,668
Why not, I want to go.

307
00:42:30,517 --> 00:42:31,880
Okay then go.

308
00:42:32,789 --> 00:42:34,480
And do you think they are waiting for you?

309
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:36,058
They are not waiting for you.

310
00:42:36,158 --> 00:42:39,312
There are millions like
you, millions better than you.

311
00:42:40,606 --> 00:42:44,128
But she certainly will. We
sponsor your new library.

312
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:47,098
And that's good. But what
will you do with Harvard?

313
00:42:47,198 --> 00:42:51,116
Come back here. Nobody here
cares about a Harvard degree.

314
00:42:51,216 --> 00:42:53,597
- Why would I need to go back?
- Exactly.

315
00:42:54,325 --> 00:42:56,806
Dreams die in paradise, Ante.

316
00:42:57,543 --> 00:42:59,396
I know what's best for my daughter.

317
00:43:04,615 --> 00:43:06,960
Like you know what's best for me, right?

318
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:14,369
Okay. Julija can go to Harvard,

319
00:43:14,477 --> 00:43:17,254
but when she comes
back, she can run our resort.

320
00:43:17,354 --> 00:43:19,489
She'll do a lot better than that.

321
00:43:33,623 --> 00:43:34,623
Thanks.

322
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:46,795
Ante, you already ate one.

323
00:43:48,156 --> 00:43:53,146
You'll love me anyway, no
matter how much I get fat.

324
00:43:54,435 --> 00:43:56,279
Did you worry about me today?

325
00:43:57,399 --> 00:44:01,230
Did you worry when I bled
in the water like an animal?

326
00:44:10,352 --> 00:44:11,375
He leaves.

327
00:44:21,888 --> 00:44:23,790
You went too far, as usual.

328
00:44:52,793 --> 00:44:57,470
Julija, what happens when big
and small boats dock together?

329
00:45:00,777 --> 00:45:04,245
The little boats save
people while the boats sink.

330
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,119
They hit.

331
00:45:06,502 --> 00:45:08,259
Say good night and go to bed.

332
00:47:37,045 --> 00:47:38,296
What are you doing?

333
00:47:40,063 --> 00:47:41,106
Any.

334
00:47:51,879 --> 00:47:53,479
Is that your mother's dress?

335
00:47:59,922 --> 00:48:01,377
You have the shoulders of a man.

336
00:49:22,329 --> 00:49:23,813
Where the fuck is she?

337
00:49:25,615 --> 00:49:27,083
Try deeper.

338
00:49:57,419 --> 00:49:59,417
I can be just like him.

339
00:50:01,363 --> 00:50:04,049
I can send you to some
boarding school in the mountains.

340
00:50:13,559 --> 00:50:14,843
Julija, money!

341
00:50:17,666 --> 00:50:19,015
Really.

342
00:50:19,753 --> 00:50:23,419
I forbid you to speak to him.
Pavo and the mayor are arriving.

343
00:50:23,519 --> 00:50:25,952
I don't want to see your face!

344
00:50:42,383 --> 00:50:43,810
Where's Javier?

345
00:50:44,417 --> 00:50:46,544
- They're coming.
- Still sleeping.

346
00:50:46,726 --> 00:50:48,474
It's already 10 am!

347
00:50:54,218 --> 00:50:55,532
Lower!

348
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:02,279
What happened last night?

349
00:51:04,038 --> 00:51:05,929
As well? Nothing happened.

350
00:51:12,572 --> 00:51:13,851
Way!

351
00:51:14,694 --> 00:51:15,721
Good Morning.

352
00:51:16,505 --> 00:51:17,505
Good Morning.

353
00:51:29,285 --> 00:51:32,281
Which boarding school
do your children attend?

354
00:51:32,381 --> 00:51:33,381
Le Rosey.

355
00:51:34,093 --> 00:51:35,445
Where it is?

356
00:51:35,545 --> 00:51:36,869
In Switzerland.

357
00:51:37,774 --> 00:51:39,039
It is good?

358
00:51:39,904 --> 00:51:41,084
It's the best.

359
00:51:43,911 --> 00:51:46,500
Why? Why ask?

360
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,233
They'll be here in an hour.

361
00:51:54,075 --> 00:51:55,720
Do you know what this song is about?

362
00:51:59,118 --> 00:52:04,120
Talks about falling in
love, as only 17 years do.

363
00:52:06,546 --> 00:52:08,444
I never fell in love.

364
00:52:09,045 --> 00:52:10,663
How could?

365
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,862
Go unlock the gate to Pavo.

366
00:52:58,153 --> 00:53:00,711
That's... For Dubrovnik,
Zagreb... Can you tell me?

367
00:53:02,329 --> 00:53:05,727
Dubrovnik is 4 hours away by speedboat

368
00:53:05,827 --> 00:53:09,552
and Dubrovnik-Zagreb is 6.7 hours by car.

369
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,182
Any planes nearby?

370
00:53:30,729 --> 00:53:32,137
Tax-free?

371
00:53:35,813 --> 00:53:38,474
So tell me, how do you
intend to build this so remotely?

372
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:43,195
- He has a plan.
- That triples the cost, right?

373
00:53:44,523 --> 00:53:46,575
Who do you have to build the pipeline?

374
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:50,558
- Somebody?
- Yes, we have a local company...

375
00:53:51,079 --> 00:53:52,415
A local company?

376
00:54:39,754 --> 00:54:41,915
It would be difficult to manage
this from another continent.

377
00:54:42,015 --> 00:54:45,127
But we have everything
we need on this table.

378
00:54:45,770 --> 00:54:46,844
I'll take care of it.

379
00:54:46,944 --> 00:54:49,588
Did you tell him my
wife doesn't want to sell?

380
00:54:52,538 --> 00:54:55,830
- Hi girl.
- Julija, we're working.

381
00:54:56,992 --> 00:54:58,557
Julija, come here.

382
00:55:03,071 --> 00:55:05,512
People burned to death.

383
00:55:09,181 --> 00:55:13,142
This is a great
opportunity, now is the time.

384
00:55:14,054 --> 00:55:15,429
What do you think?

385
00:55:17,838 --> 00:55:19,015
It is complicated.

386
00:55:19,637 --> 00:55:21,775
You can't build hotels there.

387
00:55:22,404 --> 00:55:25,366
- We'll build a memorial.
- Just a second.

388
00:55:39,628 --> 00:55:44,249
Leticia, please stop using
our children to your advantage.

389
00:55:45,611 --> 00:55:48,105
That's what you and your lawyers are doing.

390
00:55:49,428 --> 00:55:51,368
Stop making those excuses!

391
00:55:54,992 --> 00:55:56,610
I don't tell you how to live!

392
00:56:03,015 --> 00:56:04,880
You forget quickly.

393
00:56:05,254 --> 00:56:08,359
I wrecked his boat to save his family.

394
00:56:08,538 --> 00:56:12,050
I lost everything. Why don't
you remind Mare of that?

395
00:56:12,182 --> 00:56:17,403
Seven boys went to fight the
fire on that useless piece of rock

396
00:56:17,503 --> 00:56:19,962
and never came back.

397
00:56:20,062 --> 00:56:23,828
So what to say they died for nothing?

398
00:56:23,928 --> 00:56:27,265
- We will make a monument for them!
- The dead are dead.

399
00:56:31,071 --> 00:56:33,571
It would have been better if
he had burned to death too.

400
00:56:39,693 --> 00:56:41,556
We need to go with Javier.

401
00:56:44,015 --> 00:56:47,502
He'll forget about us as
soon as he boards the plane.

402
00:56:48,183 --> 00:56:50,976
- Come on, help me.
- This time is different.

403
00:56:58,972 --> 00:57:00,785
Javier will leave tomorrow.

404
00:57:02,110 --> 00:57:04,006
He's in love with you.

405
00:57:04,106 --> 00:57:07,079
- See how he looks at you?
- He's kidding.

406
00:57:07,422 --> 00:57:10,412
- He's been doing this for years.
- Is not true.

407
00:57:10,512 --> 00:57:13,452
- He needs you. Let's go with him.
- And then?

408
00:57:17,534 --> 00:57:20,445
Do you think we're going to
go around the world with him?

409
00:57:34,013 --> 00:57:36,929
He has his own family.
You know that, right?

410
00:57:50,890 --> 00:57:53,370
If I had your strength, I would use it.

411
00:57:54,124 --> 00:57:55,595
So, good thing it doesn't.

412
00:57:55,695 --> 00:57:59,814
I know what you want. I
saw you with him. Is obvious.

413
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:02,540
You deserve better.

414
00:58:18,416 --> 00:58:21,436
- What did you tell him?
- That I'll take you tonight.

415
00:58:34,230 --> 00:58:35,541
Javier!

416
00:58:36,297 --> 00:58:37,627
By the way.

417
00:58:38,808 --> 00:58:40,066
I'm going down!

418
00:58:50,134 --> 00:58:52,416
What did I say about leaving your room?

419
00:58:53,691 --> 00:58:55,446
Why did you let her out?

420
00:58:57,031 --> 00:58:59,670
Did I let her out? What you want?

421
00:58:59,770 --> 00:59:01,874
Lock us all in the house?

422
00:59:05,413 --> 00:59:08,239
Maybe you don't respect me, but she will!

423
00:59:16,579 --> 00:59:18,267
It's good of you to come back.

424
00:59:19,171 --> 00:59:23,132
There's a mass in town and the
entire project team will be there.

425
00:59:25,273 --> 00:59:26,947
Don't you really want to dive?

426
00:59:29,702 --> 00:59:33,552
You live in paradise, Ante. I
should learn to appreciate it.

427
00:59:43,609 --> 00:59:45,014
I'm going too.

428
00:59:46,095 --> 00:59:47,657
Let's dress it up.

429
00:59:49,343 --> 00:59:51,849
I see that everyone is brave today.

430
01:03:44,722 --> 01:03:48,747
Fantastic! I'm very proud of you.

431
01:03:49,677 --> 01:03:51,546
40 meters deep.

432
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:01,437
Well done, Julija!

433
01:04:02,551 --> 01:04:04,024
Brave girl!

434
01:04:06,406 --> 01:04:07,868
Crazy and brave.

435
01:04:07,968 --> 01:04:09,516
You did very well.

436
01:04:10,154 --> 01:04:14,659
- I told you, she takes it literally.
- I know that. I know.

437
01:04:16,738 --> 01:04:18,589
Will you come next time?

438
01:04:20,921 --> 01:04:24,990
- How it was?
- As if she was born in the sea.

439
01:04:34,965 --> 01:04:36,388
Is mad at me?

440
01:04:39,777 --> 01:04:41,677
I can't dive Just because you can't?

441
01:04:41,777 --> 01:04:43,598
Leave me alone, Julija.

442
01:04:43,904 --> 01:04:46,350
What did you want me to do?

443
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:51,104
- It has nothing to do with you.
- What does it have to do with?

444
01:04:53,092 --> 01:04:54,829
What does it have to do with?

445
01:04:58,013 --> 01:05:00,179
I got scared.

446
01:05:00,434 --> 01:05:03,419
- You're lying.
- Didn't I ask you to leave me alone?

447
01:05:04,316 --> 01:05:05,717
Leave me alone!

448
01:05:16,611 --> 01:05:18,019
Are you jealous.

449
01:05:20,311 --> 01:05:24,056
- What's wrong with you, Julija?
- There's nothing wrong with me.

450
01:05:25,836 --> 01:05:28,450
You ruined your life and
now you want to ruin mine.

451
01:05:30,356 --> 01:05:32,662
You play lovers behind daddy's back,

452
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:36,502
but you are a coward and
cannot have what you really want.

453
01:05:43,937 --> 01:05:46,855
I'm leaving with him. I don't
care if you come with me!

454
01:05:47,762 --> 01:05:49,468
Don't talk to your mother like that.

455
01:05:52,147 --> 01:05:56,067
When he leaves, you will be
grounded. It won't go anywhere.

456
01:05:56,569 --> 01:05:57,713
Understood?

457
01:06:25,669 --> 01:06:27,626
Steam, Julija!

458
01:06:28,108 --> 01:06:29,303
Turn off the engine!

459
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:27,607
Hi, want a drink?

460
01:07:29,688 --> 01:07:30,788
Would you like?

461
01:07:56,886 --> 01:07:58,247
You live there, right?

462
01:07:59,115 --> 01:08:00,115
Do not.

463
01:08:01,723 --> 01:08:03,863
Wasn't your father
yelling at us the other day?

464
01:08:05,939 --> 01:08:09,380
No, my father is a millionaire.

465
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:16,512
We're going around the
world before I go to Harvard.

466
01:08:17,503 --> 01:08:18,503
Legal.

467
01:08:24,771 --> 01:08:27,908
So, are you here to swim
and visit the fisherman?

468
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:40,511
He's in love with his wife.
That's why we're here.

469
01:08:45,356 --> 01:08:46,718
Are you having an affair?

470
01:09:27,258 --> 01:09:28,375
I'm running.

471
01:09:31,733 --> 01:09:33,085
Is it Harvard?

472
01:09:40,437 --> 01:09:42,170
- Want to come with us?
- Julija!

473
01:09:44,852 --> 01:09:47,904
Julija, let's go! I know!

474
01:09:48,805 --> 01:09:50,096
I will never go back.

475
01:09:50,196 --> 01:09:52,360
Come on... We have a party to go to.

476
01:09:52,460 --> 01:09:56,220
It does not matter. I
can do whatever I want.

477
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:58,222
For sure.

478
01:09:59,564 --> 01:10:06,473
Boys! I'll give this watch to the first one
who pulls my daughter out of the water!

479
01:10:07,013 --> 01:10:08,861
- We will.
- Do you want this watch?

480
01:10:11,195 --> 01:10:12,753
You better be quick!

481
01:10:13,179 --> 01:10:14,339
Want to come?

482
01:10:18,778 --> 01:10:21,324
Sorry guys! Very slowly.

483
01:10:24,081 --> 01:10:25,286
You are dangerous.

484
01:10:31,406 --> 01:10:32,525
What was it?

485
01:10:36,146 --> 01:10:37,484
You leave tomorrow.

486
01:10:41,973 --> 01:10:46,982
Javi, come get dressed,
we're going to be late!

487
01:11:10,495 --> 01:11:13,102
You became important overnight, didn't you?

488
01:11:13,783 --> 01:11:15,133
Where are you going?

489
01:11:15,672 --> 01:11:17,470
- Do you think you're smart?
- Let me go.

490
01:11:17,570 --> 01:11:19,548
Do you think you're smart?

491
01:11:22,690 --> 01:11:24,523
- What did you talk about?
- Nothing.

492
01:11:24,623 --> 01:11:25,950
What?

493
01:11:27,748 --> 01:11:30,091
For thirteen years I worked for this man.

494
01:11:30,191 --> 01:11:32,567
Then one wrong act and he kicked us out.

495
01:11:32,667 --> 01:11:37,174
Me, you and your mother!
He didn't give a damn!

496
01:11:37,279 --> 01:11:40,420
Who do you think he is?
Do you think he's your friend?

497
01:11:43,526 --> 01:11:45,478
He's not here to buy your land.

498
01:11:48,289 --> 01:11:51,641
You will never go to Harvard!

499
01:11:51,741 --> 01:11:55,186
You will never go anywhere!

500
01:11:59,549 --> 01:12:02,555
Want to behave like an
animal? You'll be stuck like one!

501
01:12:02,986 --> 01:12:03,986
Let me go!

502
01:12:04,399 --> 01:12:07,064
You'll be alone in this house Like a dog!

503
01:12:07,164 --> 01:12:09,689
You will spend ten years in this hole.

504
01:12:11,904 --> 01:12:14,281
- Goes into!
- You will stay here alone!

505
01:12:16,711 --> 01:12:18,348
Open the door!

506
01:12:21,316 --> 01:12:22,627
Open!

507
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:22,902
Here, eat something.

508
01:13:25,647 --> 01:13:28,019
You can take this with you.

509
01:13:31,797 --> 01:13:33,868
You provoked him.

510
01:13:34,938 --> 01:13:38,396
- Do you know what will happen?
- You did this to us.

511
01:13:39,289 --> 01:13:40,652
on it! We will.

512
01:13:50,457 --> 01:13:54,412
We could have had a
normal life, but you chose this.

513
01:13:54,512 --> 01:13:55,736
It's my fault?

514
01:14:00,425 --> 01:14:03,413
One day, you'll realize what I do for you.

515
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:05,509
What did you do?

516
01:14:06,187 --> 01:14:08,232
To be the island's miss beauty?

517
01:14:11,294 --> 01:14:12,881
In it, what did I say?

518
01:19:23,669 --> 01:19:24,739
Mom!

519
01:19:26,248 --> 01:19:27,540
Mom!

520
01:19:48,679 --> 01:19:50,104
Dad!

521
01:22:11,713 --> 01:22:12,983
I hate you!

522
01:22:16,860 --> 01:22:19,534
Go! Hit me in front of everyone.

523
01:22:21,168 --> 01:22:23,308
Hit me in front of everyone.

524
01:22:23,633 --> 01:22:25,867
Mom hates you! Everyone hates you!

525
01:22:26,671 --> 01:22:30,359
People burned to death on
the land he's trying to sell you.

526
01:22:31,261 --> 01:22:32,778
Calm down, Ante, calm down.

527
01:22:32,878 --> 01:22:34,353
He lied to you!

528
01:22:34,563 --> 01:22:35,565
Before, calm down.

529
01:22:35,665 --> 01:22:36,833
Do not touch me!

530
01:22:37,851 --> 01:22:41,427
Why the fuck are you here? To
eat my wife and raise my daughter?

531
01:22:41,527 --> 01:22:45,216
You primitive idiot. If
you hurt them, I'll kill you!

532
01:22:47,417 --> 01:22:48,526
You coward!

533
01:22:50,095 --> 01:22:51,287
Coward!

534
01:22:52,718 --> 01:22:56,371
You are no longer my
daughter. I disown you!

535
01:22:56,566 --> 01:22:58,125
Do not touch me!

536
01:22:58,381 --> 01:22:59,772
On it, come here!

537
01:22:59,872 --> 01:23:03,431
Please take me here. I
can't take this place anymore.

538
01:23:03,772 --> 01:23:08,119
- Take me with you to Switzerland.
- Julija, I can't take you with me.

539
01:23:09,926 --> 01:23:10,926
Please.

540
01:23:14,812 --> 01:23:17,126
In it, I can book a room
for you in Dubrovnik.

541
01:23:17,226 --> 01:23:18,580
Give him a few days to calm down.

542
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:20,568
Javi, it's time for you to leave.

543
01:23:26,211 --> 01:23:29,061
- Julija, let's go home.
- Do not touch me.

544
01:23:54,017 --> 01:23:55,017
I'm ready.

545
01:24:08,713 --> 01:24:09,713
Julija.

546
01:24:12,660 --> 01:24:13,672
I'm ready.

547
01:24:39,012 --> 01:24:40,012
You are strong.

548
01:24:50,025 --> 01:24:51,025
Please Javier...

549
01:24:53,914 --> 01:24:57,607
You have to take me with
you. I can't stay in this house.

550
01:24:58,653 --> 01:24:59,683
I am really sorry.

551
01:25:07,844 --> 01:25:11,835
It was all a lie. You lied to me.

552
01:27:10,413 --> 01:27:11,644
Nobody loves Me?

553
01:27:35,214 --> 01:27:36,268
And who loves you?

554
01:27:46,422 --> 01:27:48,559
Remember that when you
think about how bad I am.
