1
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:58,402
Gen. Zevo, I'm Owen Owens.
I'm sorry for the note of urgency...

2
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:03,531
...in the telegram, but we don't think
he has much longer.

3
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:08,742
Actually, of course,
he shouldn't even be here today...

4
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:11,445
...but you know your brother.
This factory's his life.

5
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,996
What's the status
on Kenneth's condition?

6
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,500
He could go at any time.

7
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,499
Is that confirmed,
or is that just scuttlebutt?

8
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:21,915
Oh, no, no, no. The doctors
are in agreement. It's imminent.

9
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:51,081
It was a heartbreaking decision to make,
but I had no choice.

10
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:55,459
I'd always planned to turn the reins
of the business over to my son, les...

11
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:58,748
...or even my daughter, alsatia...

12
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:03,883
...but he's just not prepared at this time
for that kind of responsibility.

13
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,973
And she's, well....

14
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:10,680
That's why I wanted
to see you before I die.

15
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:13,602
I have a proposal to make.

16
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:16,851
I know you were always father's favorite.

17
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:20,355
You followed in his footsteps,
and I didn't.

18
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:24,608
But I made this company what it is today,
and I'm proud of that fact.

19
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:27,822
And I'm not about to let it die with me.

20
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,540
I want you to take over
the presidency of zevo toys.

21
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:36,077
-And give up the military?
-Yes.

22
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,792
I know you haven't been happy
since Vietnam.

23
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,003
They gave it away, Kenneth.

24
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:45,094
Let's face it, Leland.
Your glory days are over.

25
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:48,341
Your great war is never going to come.

26
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:52,604
It would be a shame to let
your leadership qualities go to waste.

27
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:55,926
You want me to give up my commission
and step into your shoes?

28
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,645
I think it would be well worth your while.

29
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:02,437
But more importantly,
it's a new challenge, Leland...

30
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,782
...a chance for you to be your own
man for once in your life...

31
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,779
...a place to be appreciated.

32
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,162
What do you think?

33
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,661
Total control of the company?

34
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,912
What about alsatia and Leslie?

35
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:23,916
Well, I'd like them to remain with the
company. They love it. It's their world.

36
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:25,962
And I hope, one day,
with your help...

37
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,626
...Leslie will be able to succeed you
when you retire.

38
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:35,135
You see, he just doesn't
have the ambition to--

39
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,351
oh, dear.

40
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:44,111
I'll call the paramedics, sir.
Dorothy, call the paramedics, quickly.

41
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,685
What's going on?
Are you all right, Kenny?

42
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,323
It's his heart.
After his operation last year...

43
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,612
...he hooked up his propeller
to his pacemaker.

44
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:55,788
It's sort of an early warning signal.

45
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:59,117
It's whimsical, Leland.

46
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:00,921
Medic!

47
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:17,718
Kenneth, I beg you
to reconsider your decision.

48
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:23,726
Owens, my brother holds the key,
the key to Leslie finally growing up.

49
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:30,030
Kenneth, it's such a terrible risk to take.
I mean, your son is such a....

50
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:35,695
-A flake?
-Yeah.

51
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:38,119
I know.

52
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:40,211
So am I.

53
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:29,211
Leslie, alsatia, ready?

54
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:37,756
-Finished tidying up?
-Yeah.

55
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:40,061
The limousine's waiting.

56
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:45,403
I'd rather drive dad's car,
if you don't mind, Owen.

57
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,690
And so this gentle man
goes to his final rest...

58
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:34,240
...leaving behind him a legacy
of innocence and laughter.

59
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:37,197
When the child of today
becomes the peace-loving...

60
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:43,698
...citizen of tomorrow, he will be partially
indebted to this great man.

61
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:50,004
And yet, when I say man,
i mean in body only.

62
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:55,553
For he was the eternal child in all of us.

63
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:08,351
The sorrow that we feel....

64
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:16,647
The sorrow that we feel....

65
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:23,406
The sorrow that we feel, however....

66
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:36,881
Good one, dad.

67
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:45,135
The sorrow that we feel
is tempered, however...

68
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:49,271
...in the knowledge
that angels, somewhere...

69
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:53,060
...are trumpeting this man's tin horns.

70
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:56,994
Tin horns. I like that.
Tin horns are fun.

71
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:05,123
Don't you think we should take out
the barrel of laughs?

72
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:09,252
Dad would want us to leave it.
The batteries will run out in a few hours.

73
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:10,959
Yeah.

74
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:15,629
I just love that, tin horns.
It just stays with me.

75
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,090
I know what you mean.

76
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,466
Owens.

77
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:22,587
Yes, sir.

78
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:26,351
I want a tour of the factory
first thing in the morning.

79
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:27,469
Yes, sir.

80
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:01,071
<i>Big ears, take three.</i>

81
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:04,569
These ears are so big we're
gonna have a problem with Disney.

82
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:07,992
-I think you look like fievel.
-Thank you.

83
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:12,082
I think maybe a little ornamentation
would bring attention to them...

84
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,330
-...if people are missing it.
-That's very interesting.

85
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:16,042
Are we making fun of people
with big ears?

86
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:17,792
We're making fun of people
with small heads.

87
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:22,211
Either way, we're gonna get letters
from the royal family. It's not good.

88
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:24,505
Can we make the fingernails filthier?

89
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:26,219
That's a nice effect.

90
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,179
-It's kind of like--
-it's too shiny.

91
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:30,059
I have gen. Zevo with me.

92
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:33,221
Great. We're watching
the novelty tests. Care to join?

93
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:34,431
No.

94
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:37,766
<i>Doggy doo test, take eight.</i>

95
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:42,192
<i>Oh, bad dog. Bad. Do you have
any newspaper or anything?</i>

96
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:45,203
<i>Any newspaper that
you can use to get that with?</i>

97
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:47,316
<i>I shouldn't leave that in a food store.</i>

98
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:49,532
-That's very good.
-A sweater on the leash...

99
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:51,244
...and then the poop dispenser.

100
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,084
-Maybe crap in a can.
-That's it.

101
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,659
-Oh, that's good.
-Or a bath product, shampoop.

102
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:59,084
-Do people want to take poop in the tub?
-Only if it floats.

103
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,585
Well, we've all done it.

104
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:06,223
This is not a shared experience.

105
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:08,094
They get paid for this?

106
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:10,724
He's just wondering
if something's wrong with this.

107
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,980
-What the--?
-Oh, it's alsatia.

108
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:19,734
She likes to wear clip-on clothing
and dolls' wigs to work.

109
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:22,691
She insists on trying
everything out on herself first.

110
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:28,861
-Very dedicated.
-Looney bird. Let's get this over with.

111
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:38,669
Oh, everything's all set for you to see.

112
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:42,917
The fabrics are here.
The doll prototypes are here.

113
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:45,796
Some of the new fashion
illustrations are here.

114
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:47,634
Not interested in sissy stuff.

115
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:50,391
Don't you want to see
the new doll designs?

116
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:53,137
I think they could be very endearing.

117
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,570
Lunch, anyone?

118
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:10,566
I'm in the mood for smoked chicken.
How about you?

119
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:15,076
-Smoke, that's funny.
-Thank you. Is that you, alsatia?

120
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,950
-What is it?
-It's a smoking jacket.

121
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:22,673
-It's our new novelty/apparel thing.
-That's a great deal of fun, Leslie...

122
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:24,794
...but can't you put yourself out?

123
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:28,126
I wish I could, Owen.
Let me find the off button.

124
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:30,883
I think a boat's coming.
It's a large boat.

125
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:34,891
Owen, save the women and children.
I'll go down with the general.

126
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:39,393
Well, that's better.
Remind me to make a note.

127
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:43,193
Make off button more accessible.
There it is.

128
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:46,189
Now that you've seen
the factory, what do you think?

129
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:47,572
Ready to take over zevo?

130
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:50,531
That's one decision
i cannot make on my own.

131
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:54,570
I have to see somebody else first.
Come along, Owens.

132
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,750
-Owen, who does he have to see?
-I believe he's going to see his father.

133
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:09,013
Granddaddy?
I thought he was dead.

134
00:18:19,182 --> 00:18:21,272
Daddy.

135
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:26,153
Oh, I know. I know.
You're a four star general.

136
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:28,819
I know. You have four stars to my three.

137
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:32,318
Every time I come here, you turn
that cursed light on to remind me...

138
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:35,492
...to humiliate me.
I could have had four stars, daddy...

139
00:18:35,532 --> 00:18:38,032
...if it wasn't for this cursed
British accent of mine.

140
00:18:38,243 --> 00:18:41,043
You had to be stationed
in england during my formative years.

141
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:45,126
It's your fault. I've never been taken
for a real American.

142
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:49,052
-Why didn't you see a linguist?
-I went to see a linguist.

143
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:53,054
I went to see a dialect coach.
And the best I can do is:

144
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:59,888
You men stand over there and remain
at attention until further notice.

145
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:02,305
They didn't buy it.

146
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:09,904
--Jersey city...

147
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:13,397
...adenoids.

148
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:16,445
Yeah. Well, look,
i need your advice, daddy.

149
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:20,909
You see, just before Kenny died,
he asked me to take over his company.

150
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:25,674
-Toys?
-No, no, you don't understand, dad.

151
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:29,587
You see, there's a serious problem
with the military right now.

152
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:33,013
It's whether it's worth
the cost or not.

153
00:19:33,048 --> 00:19:37,718
Hell, communism just went into the toilet
and the budget fell out of the military.

154
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:42,681
-The military is not what it once was.
-There will be another war.

155
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:47,351
There won't be another war,
not the kind we know. War has changed.

156
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:50,265
You can't even trust
your own troops anymore.

157
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:54,355
Why, daddy, in Vietnam one night...

158
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:58,822
...one of my own men tried to frag me.

159
00:20:02,994 --> 00:20:04,754
--Big cock.

160
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:09,963
No, no. I said frag me!
He tried to shoot me.

161
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:12,211
Please try to understand, daddy.

162
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:16,633
I'm not giving up on the military,
the military gave up on me.

163
00:20:16,675 --> 00:20:21,635
-Well, change sides.
-I can't change sides, you silly old fart.

164
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,430
There's no sides to change sides to.

165
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:27,436
I've got no options left.
I'm out of a job.

166
00:20:27,602 --> 00:20:32,822
Look, please. Please, daddy, what the
hell am I gonna do? Will you tell me that?

167
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:39,236
Daddy, what am I going to do?

168
00:20:39,614 --> 00:20:44,334
Daddy, should I take over
Kenny's business?

169
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:58,970
-You free tonight, Debbie?
-Sure, Leland.

170
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:26,449
To achieve Kenneth's vision of the
future, we must continue to modernize...

171
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:29,211
...but not just for the sake
of modernization.

172
00:21:29,414 --> 00:21:32,424
It requires the integration
of new concepts and designs...

173
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:36,709
...with the training of our employees
in new technologies and equipment.

174
00:21:36,755 --> 00:21:41,625
However, Kenneth felt very strongly
that some of the older toys are unique...

175
00:21:41,676 --> 00:21:46,766
...because we never attempted to update
them in pursuit of perceived trends.

176
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:52,556
To guide this modernization,
we need to have and initiate...

177
00:21:52,604 --> 00:21:56,944
...fundamental, functional
area plans for modernization...

178
00:21:56,983 --> 00:22:00,203
...to link the past with the future.

179
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:03,073
Fred, I think you want to
take over this point.

180
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:07,334
Thank you. We've been getting good play
from the new Mr. minky doll.

181
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:12,328
It's a leader and a unique doll
in the marketplace.

182
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:16,039
Our home video games
are doing exceedingly well...

183
00:22:16,586 --> 00:22:22,926
...particularly "big argyles," "felsors,"
"osmosis" and "helos course"...

184
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:26,217
That's a fabulous game.
It's better than "Mr. squirt's night out."

185
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:29,559
..."clucking hens"
and "Bob goes camping."

186
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:32,849
Fred, I haven't heard anything
on the t-3100 racer.

187
00:22:32,894 --> 00:22:36,364
-Where are we in development?
-I'll answer that.

188
00:22:36,398 --> 00:22:40,688
We've been holding on that because
the advance plans for the t-3100...

189
00:22:40,735 --> 00:22:44,315
...appear to be incorporated into
axle's designs for their racer...

190
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:46,534
...which would beat us
to the marketplace.

191
00:22:46,574 --> 00:22:50,794
This is an unfortunate setback. We're
sure those plans were leaked to axle.

192
00:22:50,954 --> 00:22:54,004
Leaked? Did somebody say
the plans were leaked?

193
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:58,957
Oh, every so often a degree of industrial
espionage, so to speak, does occur.

194
00:22:59,004 --> 00:23:04,134
Espionage. Owens, would you
give me a moment of your time, please?

195
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,550
Yes, sir.

196
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:06,893
Can you believe axle?

197
00:23:06,928 --> 00:23:09,718
I don't know why they come
up with what they come out with.

198
00:23:09,764 --> 00:23:12,604
"Guns and noses."
What type of toy is that?

199
00:23:12,642 --> 00:23:15,402
They came out with a toy
called "carnival Joe."

200
00:23:15,437 --> 00:23:18,567
-You can add your own fingers and teeth.
-That's amazing.

201
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:20,936
I don't know.
What's with the whole new line?

202
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:24,864
-Sir, we're in the supply closet.
-Are we really?

203
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:28,414
Now, tell me about
that espionage problem.

204
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:31,870
-Well, general--
-keep your voice down.

205
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:35,871
-Well, general, the stealing of toy--
-i can't hear you.

206
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:38,415
-Well, general--
-i still can't hear you.

207
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:42,260
-Well, the stealing-- all right?
-That's fine. That's good. Carry on.

208
00:23:42,297 --> 00:23:45,927
The stealing of toy designs
is not unusual in this business.

209
00:23:45,967 --> 00:23:48,597
You see, we're not set up
to protect ourselves.

210
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:51,426
I know the perfect man
to deal with this trouble.

211
00:23:51,473 --> 00:23:54,143
-Who?
-Patrick zevo, my son.

212
00:23:58,605 --> 00:24:03,645
I must apologize for my son.
He's usually very punctual.

213
00:24:03,693 --> 00:24:09,493
-Where is he coming from?
-Alsatia, he's with covert operations.

214
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:12,372
So let's just leave it at that, all right?

215
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:17,250
-Canapé, general?
-Yes, perhaps I will.

216
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:20,210
-The deviled eggs look good.
-Don't they?

217
00:24:22,212 --> 00:24:24,422
Oh, that's a quick egg, isn't it?

218
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:27,838
Look at that egg scramble.
Getting a little egg-cited.

219
00:24:28,218 --> 00:24:31,388
Talk about fresh,
these are rude. Look.

220
00:24:31,638 --> 00:24:34,428
These eggs are acting--
maybe they really are deviled eggs.

221
00:24:34,641 --> 00:24:39,651
Look at that, they're possessed.<i>
El huevo del diablo. </i>Save yourself.

222
00:24:39,688 --> 00:24:42,648
Get away from here.
You must go away from here.

223
00:24:42,691 --> 00:24:46,611
Quickly, get some toothpicks.
Make a cross. See what's happening?

224
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:50,283
Suck my yellows-- save yourselves
from these appetizers from hell.

225
00:24:50,323 --> 00:24:52,413
Quick. Run. Tell the village.

226
00:24:52,784 --> 00:24:55,124
Look at that.
Stand back, it's gonna spit.

227
00:24:55,286 --> 00:24:57,536
I can't control myself any longer!

228
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:02,090
-How do you do that?
-Magnets.

229
00:25:02,127 --> 00:25:05,917
-It's one of dad's favorite novelty items.
-You're as big a fool as your father.

230
00:25:06,464 --> 00:25:09,134
You really think so? Thank you.

231
00:25:09,718 --> 00:25:12,388
I'm getting very hungry.
I want my dinner now.

232
00:25:12,595 --> 00:25:14,465
Then let's eat.

233
00:25:15,223 --> 00:25:17,563
The sofa's hungry too.

234
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:22,730
-Patrick, my son.
-Dad.

235
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:25,981
-That was wonderful.
-That's a neat trick.

236
00:25:26,234 --> 00:25:27,574
I don't play tricks.

237
00:25:27,777 --> 00:25:31,197
Patrick's in camouflage
so he can have full surveillance...

238
00:25:31,239 --> 00:25:33,779
...of the situation before his presence
is known. That right?

239
00:25:33,992 --> 00:25:36,202
100%, dad.

240
00:25:40,957 --> 00:25:43,497
Is that all you're having?
White bread's the worst thing.

241
00:25:43,752 --> 00:25:46,302
No, it isn't.
It's very soft and pliable.

242
00:25:46,338 --> 00:25:49,508
It slides down the system
without disturbing anything.

243
00:25:49,924 --> 00:25:54,434
-There's no nutrition in that sandwich.
-Yes, there is. Vitamin pills.

244
00:25:54,637 --> 00:25:56,807
Something's working.
You always look the same age.

245
00:25:57,057 --> 00:26:00,557
Patrick, remember staying here as a kid?
I'll never forget--

246
00:26:00,602 --> 00:26:02,812
I told your mother not to leave you here.
When was that?

247
00:26:03,021 --> 00:26:04,981
The time you had mom
join you in Vietnam.

248
00:26:05,148 --> 00:26:07,778
That's right. She never came back.

249
00:26:07,817 --> 00:26:10,817
I'm sorry. You loved her
very much, didn't you?

250
00:26:10,987 --> 00:26:14,947
I'm not ashamed to admit it, because dad
did everything he could to save her.

251
00:26:14,991 --> 00:26:17,621
That's right, son.
Dee Dee was a wonderful woman...

252
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:20,500
...but appendicitis
is a respecter of no one.

253
00:26:20,538 --> 00:26:23,828
By the time we knew
something was wrong--

254
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:25,835
dad, don't.
Come on, take it easy.

255
00:26:25,877 --> 00:26:29,007
-I'll never forgive myself, Patrick.
-All right. I know.

256
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:37,137
That's just the vitamin b complex.
It's vitamin e I have the problems with.

257
00:26:37,806 --> 00:26:40,306
Gelatin capsule gets stuck
in between my teeth...

258
00:26:40,517 --> 00:26:43,437
...and then the stuff inside
mixes with the mayonnaise--

259
00:26:43,478 --> 00:26:46,268
-enjoying the wine, general?
-It's fine. It's fine.

260
00:26:49,818 --> 00:26:51,488
It's a good Bordeaux, isn't it?

261
00:26:52,195 --> 00:26:54,655
It's got a good nose.
May I have some more?

262
00:26:54,698 --> 00:26:57,118
-You want more?
-I can't get enough of it.

263
00:26:57,158 --> 00:26:59,908
Patrick, now that you've joined
the ranks of zevo toys...

264
00:26:59,953 --> 00:27:01,913
...what are your plans for the situation?

265
00:27:01,955 --> 00:27:04,365
Patrick's bringing in a special force.

266
00:27:04,416 --> 00:27:07,376
We'll begin with the interrogation
of every man and woman.

267
00:27:07,419 --> 00:27:11,259
We'll set up security so no one can
leave or enter without our knowledge.

268
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:14,344
-Do we get to wear badges?
-Photographic identification.

269
00:27:14,551 --> 00:27:16,551
I take a very nice picture.

270
00:27:16,928 --> 00:27:19,388
As for me, I'll be meeting
with our designers...

271
00:27:19,431 --> 00:27:21,851
...so we can begin production
of our new line.

272
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:26,149
-A new line?
-I'm noodling with the idea...

273
00:27:26,187 --> 00:27:28,727
...of putting in some war toys.

274
00:27:29,274 --> 00:27:32,574
-We've never made war toys at zevo.
-That's most unusual.

275
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:35,240
It's a natural idea
for you to make war toys.

276
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,700
We never did, because dad
didn't like the idea of war toys.

277
00:27:38,742 --> 00:27:42,542
He thought that war
was the domain of a small penis.

278
00:27:42,579 --> 00:27:46,369
Well, is that so, Leslie?
Well, I'd really be most grateful, Leslie...

279
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:50,746
...if you would assist me in this area.
That all right?

280
00:27:51,129 --> 00:27:52,169
Sure.

281
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:55,260
-Dad, to war toys.
-War toys.

282
00:27:57,052 --> 00:28:00,682
What do you think of my bringing Leslie
into the war toy department?

283
00:28:00,722 --> 00:28:04,312
-Smart tactical maneuver.
-I thought you'd see it that way.

284
00:28:04,351 --> 00:28:07,651
Like you always said,
treat your friends like your enemies...

285
00:28:07,687 --> 00:28:10,147
...and your enemies like your friends.

286
00:28:14,277 --> 00:28:15,607
-Dad?
-Yeah?

287
00:28:15,653 --> 00:28:17,493
-Tell your driver to stop here.
-Why?

288
00:28:18,114 --> 00:28:19,994
-I'm getting out.
-You don't know where you are.

289
00:28:20,158 --> 00:28:22,158
-That's right.
-Always in training?

290
00:28:22,327 --> 00:28:25,787
Hundred percent.
See you in the morning.

291
00:28:26,831 --> 00:28:28,291
That's my boy.

292
00:28:35,507 --> 00:28:40,967
"The cat chased the rat all day,
till they finally found each other's name."

293
00:28:41,012 --> 00:28:43,562
-What?
-I don't understand.

294
00:28:44,015 --> 00:28:46,135
-It's a fable.
-No, no, no.

295
00:28:46,351 --> 00:28:50,691
I don't understand why daddy
let uncle Leland take over zevo toys.

296
00:28:50,897 --> 00:28:53,187
You'd think he would have
left Owen in charge.

297
00:28:53,441 --> 00:28:56,491
-Or you.
-No, dad knew better.

298
00:28:56,695 --> 00:29:01,825
Well, one thing I know is strange.
And that man is strange.

299
00:29:01,866 --> 00:29:05,156
How are you going to work with him,
especially on war toys?

300
00:29:05,203 --> 00:29:09,793
Sometimes it's better to dress up
like a lamb to tempt the wolf.

301
00:29:09,833 --> 00:29:13,553
Oh, I see. Just like daddy always said.

302
00:29:13,586 --> 00:29:16,916
Treat your friends like your friends
and your enemy like your enemy.

303
00:29:17,215 --> 00:29:20,005
Yeah, you use your noodle.

304
00:29:20,635 --> 00:29:22,005
Good night.

305
00:29:28,059 --> 00:29:31,769
Sleep tight. Don't let the bedbugs bite.

306
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:45,240
Night, night, alsatia.

307
00:29:45,285 --> 00:29:47,365
Thank you.

308
00:31:03,154 --> 00:31:04,994
Yo.

309
00:31:05,699 --> 00:31:06,869
Can I help you?

310
00:31:07,117 --> 00:31:09,407
You're aware we're doing
routine checks...

311
00:31:09,452 --> 00:31:12,712
...with each employee to determine
if there's been security leaks?

312
00:31:12,914 --> 00:31:14,674
Would you mind if I asked
a few questions?

313
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:20,337
So that's it, is it? Six weeks of work
and that's all you've come up with?

314
00:31:20,547 --> 00:31:22,297
These are preliminary drawings.

315
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:25,840
Just to give you an idea
of what direction we're moving into.

316
00:31:26,094 --> 00:31:28,604
Come in, Leslie.

317
00:31:28,638 --> 00:31:32,138
Sorry, I'm late. I had a little problem
with my ID check.

318
00:31:32,183 --> 00:31:34,353
Maybe we did live near a toxic dump
when I was a kid.

319
00:31:36,438 --> 00:31:38,728
Oh, this is our new body of sound coat.

320
00:31:38,773 --> 00:31:42,613
It works by Mercury switches
and movement and.... hold on a second.

321
00:31:44,571 --> 00:31:46,871
Sit down, Leslie.

322
00:31:47,073 --> 00:31:49,953
-Oh, I'll get it.
-Sit down, Leslie.

323
00:31:54,247 --> 00:31:55,827
You behave like a buffoon.

324
00:31:56,249 --> 00:32:00,129
"Buffoon," a very interesting word.
I wonder what the derivation of that is.

325
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:04,130
I love etymology of words. Maybe
it's a combination of balloon and buffalo.

326
00:32:04,174 --> 00:32:06,724
Or maybe buffer and fool.

327
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:10,560
Maybe it's from the Latin word
"buffomatus," he who carries the pickle.

328
00:32:10,764 --> 00:32:15,144
All right. Miss drum, is that the extent
of what you had to show the general?

329
00:32:18,063 --> 00:32:19,863
-Sorry.
-Miss drum.

330
00:32:20,065 --> 00:32:21,435
Yes, it is.

331
00:32:21,691 --> 00:32:25,701
In terms of military toys, do you consider
this competitive with other companies?

332
00:32:26,363 --> 00:32:30,663
-With most of the products, definitely.
-What do the rest of you think?

333
00:32:31,368 --> 00:32:34,828
Well, I'll tell you what I think.
I think this is baby shit...

334
00:32:34,871 --> 00:32:37,081
...compared with what other
companies have.

335
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:40,040
I want realism, imagination, excitement.

336
00:32:40,251 --> 00:32:43,551
-But, sir, I honestly--
-all right. You're all excused now.

337
00:32:43,588 --> 00:32:45,798
Out you go.

338
00:32:53,723 --> 00:32:57,563
Don't you think you were a little rough
on them? They're civilians.

339
00:32:57,727 --> 00:33:00,687
They're employees.
This wasn't a social call.

340
00:33:00,897 --> 00:33:03,607
But they've been
with the company for years.

341
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:05,740
-That's enough, Leslie.
-You're right.

342
00:33:05,777 --> 00:33:09,237
I should get the cream for my coffee.
I do need some cream.

343
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,240
Thank you very much.

344
00:33:12,075 --> 00:33:14,365
Can I get you anything, Owen?
A kaiser roll?

345
00:33:14,411 --> 00:33:16,871
-No, thank you.
-Anything for you, general?

346
00:33:16,913 --> 00:33:20,583
A cruise missile, something like that?
Automatic weapon? Sorry, sir.

347
00:33:22,293 --> 00:33:25,423
I'll work this out.
It just needs a little tune-up.

348
00:33:25,463 --> 00:33:30,093
I've got my work cut out, Owen.
I'm surrounded by fools.

349
00:33:32,929 --> 00:33:36,269
I've been a bad boy.

350
00:34:00,707 --> 00:34:03,037
Are you miss Gwen Tyler?

351
00:34:03,668 --> 00:34:07,338
-We're doing some routine questions.
-Okay.

352
00:34:08,214 --> 00:34:12,054
Does any duplicating go on around
here when you're not present?

353
00:34:14,137 --> 00:34:16,847
-Yeah. Maybe.
-Do you duplicate alone?

354
00:34:17,015 --> 00:34:20,345
-That's kind of a personal question.
-You're laughing, miss Tyler.

355
00:34:20,518 --> 00:34:23,098
Are you taking my
duplication investigation seriously?

356
00:34:23,146 --> 00:34:26,316
Or are you disrespecting
my duplication investigation?

357
00:34:26,358 --> 00:34:28,108
No, I'm not disrespecting.

358
00:34:28,151 --> 00:34:30,651
I'm just saying that
there's no way I can check...

359
00:34:30,695 --> 00:34:33,945
...because I leave at a certain time.
I'm not--

360
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:36,790
duplicating is taking place.

361
00:34:36,826 --> 00:34:40,616
When duplicating takes place,
that means that there's more than one.

362
00:34:40,663 --> 00:34:43,673
There may be two or three, miss Tyler.
Two, three or four.

363
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:49,799
Y'all are joking.
Are y'all kidding with me?

364
00:34:50,006 --> 00:34:53,006
I'm talking about duping. Duping.

365
00:34:53,051 --> 00:34:55,851
-Okay.
-Duplication.

366
00:34:56,221 --> 00:34:58,391
I just work here.

367
00:34:58,598 --> 00:35:00,558
-Are you in charge of duplication?
-Yes.

368
00:35:00,809 --> 00:35:03,189
Show me how this
duplicating machine works.

369
00:35:03,395 --> 00:35:05,105
I want to learn the process.

370
00:35:11,486 --> 00:35:15,276
Duplication is a serious offense.
You understand that?

371
00:35:15,323 --> 00:35:18,333
-That means whatever was duplicated--
-what's going on here?

372
00:35:18,993 --> 00:35:21,163
Security check.

373
00:35:21,204 --> 00:35:25,084
-Everything looks pretty secure to me.
-She's clean. Let's go.

374
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:29,045
-I'll see you later, cousin.
-Oh, yeah. I'll chill, will.

375
00:35:29,087 --> 00:35:32,167
Hey, the coast is clear.
You can come out now.

376
00:35:32,382 --> 00:35:34,092
That can't be good for your hair.

377
00:35:34,884 --> 00:35:37,144
Forward, march!

378
00:35:38,263 --> 00:35:40,683
You can come out now.

379
00:35:41,182 --> 00:35:43,732
-How are you?
-Sorry, I'm fine.

380
00:35:43,768 --> 00:35:45,018
-It's all right.
-I'm okay.

381
00:35:45,061 --> 00:35:46,651
Okay.

382
00:35:47,272 --> 00:35:50,232
-You're new here, aren't you?
-Yeah.

383
00:35:51,901 --> 00:35:55,911
I know you're a little upset, but
you've got to let it go or get over it.

384
00:35:56,072 --> 00:35:58,122
Pick one of those. Any one.

385
00:35:58,324 --> 00:36:00,294
-Who was that man?
-That's my cousin.

386
00:36:00,326 --> 00:36:02,786
-I'll tell you what....
-What?

387
00:36:02,829 --> 00:36:05,709
-I can't believe the treatment here.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

388
00:36:05,957 --> 00:36:08,247
How about a little smile or something?

389
00:36:08,293 --> 00:36:10,923
Wait a minute,
is this what you were up to?

390
00:36:11,129 --> 00:36:14,339
Arts and crafts, this is fabulous.

391
00:36:14,549 --> 00:36:17,259
Look at that face.
Is that a great face or what?

392
00:36:17,302 --> 00:36:21,472
That's Michael Jackson before and after.
I've never had surgery, never.

393
00:36:21,514 --> 00:36:25,314
You have a look like a deer in front
of a peterbilt. Kind of:

394
00:36:25,727 --> 00:36:28,437
Hit the brakes, al. Hit the brakes.

395
00:36:28,646 --> 00:36:31,686
I love this one.
This is a very attractive one.

396
00:36:31,733 --> 00:36:36,493
This one should go on <i>sports illustrated.</i>
Not the swimsuit issue, but the boxing.

397
00:36:36,529 --> 00:36:39,489
I should have never got in the ring,
but I will take him in three rounds.

398
00:36:39,532 --> 00:36:42,622
I want the belt to go with my purse.

399
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:45,210
See? Hi. There you're laughing.
That's good.

400
00:36:45,789 --> 00:36:49,289
Hi, how are you? I'm Leslie zevo.

401
00:36:49,793 --> 00:36:51,963
I know.

402
00:36:53,004 --> 00:36:55,974
-You're back. Welcome to the living.
-You're silly.

403
00:36:56,174 --> 00:36:59,554
I'm very silly,
but that's what I do for a living.

404
00:37:03,056 --> 00:37:05,426
What kind of sandwiches
do you have, Joe?

405
00:37:05,642 --> 00:37:11,272
Oh, ham and cheese, Turkey,
chicken salad, shrimp salad.

406
00:37:11,314 --> 00:37:16,114
Joe, I'm very disappointed that you
never once had an applesauce sandwich.

407
00:37:16,736 --> 00:37:20,906
Applesauce? Ms. zevo,
the sandwich will get all soggy.

408
00:37:21,074 --> 00:37:24,744
-Oh, I don't mind.
-I'll make you one tomorrow, okay?

409
00:37:24,911 --> 00:37:30,581
Thank you very much. I'll just have
the mayonnaise sandwich again today.

410
00:37:31,793 --> 00:37:33,343
Thank you.

411
00:37:46,933 --> 00:37:51,103
-Is this seat taken?
-No, sit down.

412
00:37:56,026 --> 00:37:58,896
-Do you like my security badge?
-It's very nice.

413
00:37:58,945 --> 00:38:02,905
-I told you I take a good picture.
-That you did.

414
00:38:04,034 --> 00:38:07,044
-Don't you like your lunch?
-I hate it when food touches.

415
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:11,170
-You remind me a lot of my brother.
-Impossible. We're exact opposites.

416
00:38:11,207 --> 00:38:14,377
That's what I mean.
He's silly and soft on the outside...

417
00:38:14,419 --> 00:38:17,509
...but strong on the inside,
and you're just the opposite.

418
00:38:20,633 --> 00:38:24,183
Hi, Joe.
Can I have the tuna salad, please?

419
00:38:24,929 --> 00:38:26,469
-Here you are.
-Thank you.

420
00:38:26,514 --> 00:38:29,684
You're getting the tuna?
I hope that's dolphin-safe.

421
00:38:32,604 --> 00:38:35,654
Joe, how long do you think
she can be out of the water?

422
00:38:50,789 --> 00:38:54,629
I'm so glad
he finally discovered her.

423
00:38:54,668 --> 00:38:58,548
I think love is wonderful.
Your mother once said to love and--

424
00:38:58,755 --> 00:39:02,045
-can we not talk about my mother?
-I forgot.

425
00:39:02,092 --> 00:39:04,592
I know what a delicate
subject that is with you.

426
00:39:04,761 --> 00:39:08,681
I can't even eat.
The food keeps touching.

427
00:39:08,723 --> 00:39:12,893
I like military plates. I'm a military man.
I want a military meal.

428
00:39:12,936 --> 00:39:15,856
I want my string beans
to be quarantined.

429
00:39:15,897 --> 00:39:20,317
I like a fortress around my potatoes so
the meat loaf doesn't invade them...

430
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,150
...and cause mixing in my plate!

431
00:39:22,696 --> 00:39:26,826
I hate it when food touches!
I'm a military man.

432
00:39:26,866 --> 00:39:30,246
You understand? And don't let
your food touch either, please.

433
00:39:30,453 --> 00:39:34,753
No calories. That's good. Because if
i have a whole calorie, I just blow up.

434
00:39:34,791 --> 00:39:39,211
I get such bloat. Two or three
calories and I'm like the michelin man.

435
00:39:39,254 --> 00:39:42,054
-Do you have that problem?
-No, my mama does, though.

436
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:44,260
-Really?
-Yeah, I usually don't drink...

437
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:47,680
...artificial sweeteners. I like
just plain old soda, you know?

438
00:39:47,721 --> 00:39:50,391
-I mean, sugar can't hurt you, really.
-Right!

439
00:39:50,432 --> 00:39:55,522
I did an experiment where I put sugar
and artificial sweetener on the sidewalk.

440
00:39:55,562 --> 00:39:59,572
Within a minute, ants are all over
the sugar, doing a little ant-dance...

441
00:39:59,607 --> 00:40:03,697
...and by the artificial sweetener, they
have ants in hardhats going:

442
00:40:03,737 --> 00:40:04,897
"Move on through."

443
00:40:05,405 --> 00:40:08,365
-Where are you from?
-Here. Like what I've done with it?

444
00:40:08,408 --> 00:40:11,288
-Were you born in here?
-No, not born here.

445
00:40:11,327 --> 00:40:14,287
I was born in the back
of a bumper car.

446
00:40:15,373 --> 00:40:20,383
-That's what's wrong with you, I think.
-That's it. It's a boy!

447
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,920
Hi. This is sure fun.

448
00:40:24,424 --> 00:40:26,724
You don't have a lip.

449
00:40:26,926 --> 00:40:29,966
-Well, I'm working on that.
-That's that insecure face.

450
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:33,220
Well, yeah.
That's the face of two people who--

451
00:40:33,266 --> 00:40:36,386
-who don't like themselves.
-They can be okay with it.

452
00:40:36,436 --> 00:40:39,226
If they kiss, they basically will,
you know....

453
00:40:39,272 --> 00:40:42,032
-They bump teeth.
-And they hurt each other.

454
00:40:42,067 --> 00:40:44,687
-Then they feel bad about each other.
-They do.

455
00:40:44,736 --> 00:40:47,316
Then they're like two
lizards in the sun.

456
00:40:48,948 --> 00:40:51,368
-That's it.
-That's attractive.

457
00:40:51,409 --> 00:40:54,039
That's the type of face
you basically want to go:

458
00:40:54,245 --> 00:40:56,285
-Bye.
-Time-out.

459
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:59,920
-I haven't laughed this much in years.
-Me too.

460
00:41:00,168 --> 00:41:03,548
Do you ever get that thing
where you just laugh like:

461
00:41:05,548 --> 00:41:10,758
-Is that you?
-In a moment. Yes, it is. Stop it.

462
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:18,480
These are a lot of fun.
Put your finger in there. Don't be afraid.

463
00:41:24,109 --> 00:41:25,859
These are good for a laugh.

464
00:41:26,611 --> 00:41:29,321
Why is it that bodily
functions are always funny?

465
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:11,320
-So where are we going?
-Into town.

466
00:42:11,364 --> 00:42:14,164
I want to see what
the competition is selling.

467
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:17,540
Good idea.
I'll take the back way.

468
00:42:18,371 --> 00:42:21,461
-You okay, dad?
-No problem.

469
00:42:39,434 --> 00:42:41,274
I'm just practicing.

470
00:42:42,562 --> 00:42:44,942
Practicing?
For what?

471
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:48,230
Later, Leslie likes to come
and hear me sing.

472
00:42:49,527 --> 00:42:53,277
-You sing in the ladies' room?
-Acoustics. Good acoustics.

473
00:42:55,241 --> 00:42:56,951
You see?

474
00:42:57,619 --> 00:43:01,159
I just don't understand
the two of you.

475
00:43:01,206 --> 00:43:04,246
Well, we love to sing
and do moves.

476
00:43:04,292 --> 00:43:06,592
And he likes
to joke around a lot.

477
00:43:06,628 --> 00:43:09,918
And that makes me laugh.
Then we go get something to eat.

478
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:12,970
Wanna try it?

479
00:43:13,301 --> 00:43:16,141
No, I don't think so.

480
00:43:16,262 --> 00:43:18,142
Everyone sounds good right here.

481
00:43:18,181 --> 00:43:20,601
-Yeah?
-Oh, yeah.

482
00:43:34,781 --> 00:43:38,121
-I don't think you should do that again.
-Okay.

483
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:41,999
-You like Leslie?
-Well....

484
00:43:42,038 --> 00:43:47,088
I'm so glad you appreciate him.
Maybe it would be better as a duet.

485
00:43:47,127 --> 00:43:49,247
-Yeah?
-Maybe your voice would sound...

486
00:43:49,295 --> 00:43:51,625
-...a little more acceptable that way.
-Okay.

487
00:44:15,238 --> 00:44:16,778
Good shot!

488
00:44:20,785 --> 00:44:22,325
Good boy.

489
00:44:27,459 --> 00:44:31,499
-"Tank gunner." Like a game, pat?
-Yes, sir, but you go first.

490
00:44:31,546 --> 00:44:34,046
I'll see if I haven't lost my touch.

491
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:38,140
What have we got here? Helicopters,
500 points. Tanks, 300 points.

492
00:44:38,178 --> 00:44:41,678
-What's the penalty here?
-Minus 1000 for shooting a u.N. Truck.

493
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:44,770
That's an awfully big penalty
for hitting a u.N. Truck.

494
00:44:45,352 --> 00:44:48,312
-Give me a quarter, pat.
-I'll put it in for you.

495
00:44:49,481 --> 00:44:52,441
Here we go.
Here we are.

496
00:44:53,151 --> 00:44:55,401
This takes me right back.

497
00:45:02,118 --> 00:45:05,158
Takes me right back, Patrick.
Right back to my youth.

498
00:45:07,791 --> 00:45:11,341
Dad, you got minus 1000 penalty.
You hit the u.N. Truck.

499
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:16,760
Goddamn u.N.
They have no business being there.

500
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:21,100
Always where they're not wanted.
I'm gonna get them sons of bitches.

501
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:25,640
U.N. Guys.
White truck men.

502
00:45:28,436 --> 00:45:30,436
I nearly hit a tank there.

503
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,110
Don't wanna start doing that
with the u.N. About.

504
00:45:33,316 --> 00:45:34,976
There goes another one.

505
00:45:36,611 --> 00:45:38,991
There he goes. Yes!

506
00:45:42,117 --> 00:45:43,617
You see that?

507
00:46:19,946 --> 00:46:23,196
-How do you feel?
-Woozy.

508
00:46:23,241 --> 00:46:26,621
Great name. That's what
we'll call it. The woozy helmet.

509
00:46:26,661 --> 00:46:29,831
-What do you think about it?
-Oh, I think it's a winner.

510
00:46:29,873 --> 00:46:32,173
-You really do?
-Oh, yeah. You bet.

511
00:46:32,208 --> 00:46:36,418
I didn't know where I was, and then
i was coming up through this thing.

512
00:46:36,463 --> 00:46:40,513
And then I thought I was going
to fall off, and I felt seasick, and:

513
00:46:42,135 --> 00:46:47,135
-It's just a prototype. It'll get better.
-I think this is some of your best work.

514
00:46:47,349 --> 00:46:50,189
Thanks. If you put
in a different cartridge...

515
00:46:50,226 --> 00:46:53,436
...you can have an entirely
different experience.

516
00:46:53,646 --> 00:46:56,436
You could take a ride
and never leave your helmet.

517
00:46:56,649 --> 00:46:58,569
Take trips and
not lose your bags!

518
00:46:58,777 --> 00:47:01,317
I think daddy would
be very proud of you.

519
00:47:02,197 --> 00:47:05,697
-Thanks, al.
-Giggle.

520
00:47:06,659 --> 00:47:11,369
-This is a little uncomfortable, though.
-Well, that's supposed to go in your ear.

521
00:47:11,414 --> 00:47:13,834
-You wanna take another trip?
-Oh, yeah.

522
00:47:26,805 --> 00:47:29,345
Look at that.
We don't have anything like that.

523
00:47:29,391 --> 00:47:32,941
I ask my designer for decent war toys,
they give me diddlysquat.

524
00:47:32,977 --> 00:47:36,397
Other companies have been
designing war toys for years.

525
00:47:36,439 --> 00:47:38,569
I don't have years.

526
00:47:39,442 --> 00:47:43,992
Gotta get on with it. Time's ticking.
Gotta push these designers.

527
02:01:50,000 --> 03:00:00,000
Subtitles by dw817
Google me !

528
00:47:56,334 --> 00:48:00,384
I've been here before.
I know it. I'm sure of it.

529
00:48:00,422 --> 00:48:06,512
Perhaps in another lifetime.
Maybe even in a battle.

530
00:48:06,553 --> 00:48:10,313
You probably played here with Kenny
when you were kids, dad.

531
00:48:27,323 --> 00:48:30,493
-Want a ride?
-No. Thank you.

532
00:48:30,535 --> 00:48:32,405
-Just learning?
-Yeah, yeah.

533
00:48:32,996 --> 00:48:36,036
A little long in the tooth
for training wheels.

534
00:48:36,666 --> 00:48:40,626
-You drive out here just to insult me?
-<i>Au contraire, mon chère.</i>

535
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:44,550
-This is my way home.
-No, it isn't.

536
00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:47,760
-How about this?
-Can you get over.

537
00:48:47,802 --> 00:48:51,352
You're hogging the road.
You're hogging the road.

538
00:48:51,556 --> 00:48:55,556
Come on. Let me give you a lift,
and I'll teach you how to ride that bike.

539
00:48:59,147 --> 00:49:01,647
-Why?
-Because I wanna get laid.

540
00:49:01,858 --> 00:49:05,858
My daddy would just
have a field day with you.

541
00:49:05,904 --> 00:49:08,954
I bet I'd be swinging
from some tree.

542
00:49:11,701 --> 00:49:14,251
No. I like you.

543
00:49:15,538 --> 00:49:18,498
Well, I like you too.

544
00:49:18,541 --> 00:49:21,801
-That's why we shouldn't see each other.
-Why?

545
00:49:23,296 --> 00:49:25,916
You don't take things
very seriously, do you?

546
00:49:27,967 --> 00:49:31,347
What do you mean, "take things
seriously"? What about this hat?

547
00:49:32,722 --> 00:49:36,232
-Of course I take things seriously.
-Like what?

548
00:49:36,768 --> 00:49:41,688
Like, "save the whales, win
interesting prizes." I founded that.

549
00:49:41,731 --> 00:49:45,191
Okay. Well, how about this?
You know the general?

550
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:50,070
I'm gonna have a confrontation with him.
I don't want them to make war toys.

551
00:49:50,115 --> 00:49:52,365
I'm gonna get him
to change his mind.

552
00:49:53,743 --> 00:49:58,503
-Are you serious?
-No. Yes. Really. Yeah. Sure. Maybe.

553
00:49:58,707 --> 00:50:02,707
-See? There is no hope with you.
-Wait.

554
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:08,589
Seriously, if I convince
the general no war toys...

555
00:50:08,633 --> 00:50:11,973
...will you let me take off
your training wheels?

556
00:50:12,012 --> 00:50:13,892
I'll think about it.

557
00:50:28,945 --> 00:50:32,565
You ever wonder why an airplane
has to be a certain size?

558
00:50:32,615 --> 00:50:36,445
-Because somebody has to get inside it.
-Right.

559
00:50:36,494 --> 00:50:38,834
What happens if
you don't need a pilot?

560
00:50:39,164 --> 00:50:43,214
What if you just have remote-control
planes that carry deadly weapons?

561
00:50:43,251 --> 00:50:47,961
You saw it back there at the store.
There were toy tanks, toy planes.

562
00:50:48,006 --> 00:50:52,086
Can you imagine what it would be like
if we perfected a toy-sized plane...

563
00:50:52,135 --> 00:50:55,305
...that had deadly fighting capabilities?

564
00:50:56,514 --> 00:50:59,484
-Little remote-control planes?
-Yes!

565
00:50:59,517 --> 00:51:02,097
You saw those kids
back there at the arcade.

566
00:51:02,145 --> 00:51:06,775
They have better hand-eye coordination
than any pilot you'll ever see.

567
00:51:06,816 --> 00:51:09,986
Little children can fly
remote-control planes.

568
00:51:10,653 --> 00:51:14,783
Patrick, it's only the weaponry
that's missing.

569
00:51:15,658 --> 00:51:19,408
Can you imagine the savings if
we reduced the cost of planes?

570
00:51:19,454 --> 00:51:25,464
Say, $450 million apiece down to
$5000. That's what I'm talking about.

571
00:51:25,502 --> 00:51:30,132
The military today, pat, costs too much.
I'm talking about a cheap military...

572
00:51:30,173 --> 00:51:32,843
...an inexpensive military
for the future.

573
00:51:33,051 --> 00:51:38,931
You can't eliminate the military, so you
have to have a military you can afford.

574
00:51:38,973 --> 00:51:43,023
Little tanks, little planes,
little helicopters.

575
00:51:43,353 --> 00:51:46,653
A toy-sized military
with deadly fighting weapons.

576
00:51:46,690 --> 00:51:50,530
You give me half a billion dollars,
the cost of one stealth bomber...

577
00:51:50,735 --> 00:51:55,485
...I'll give you one million toy-sized
planes. And I guarantee one thing, pat:

578
00:51:55,532 --> 00:51:59,492
No one's gonna spot them
on the radar screens.

579
00:51:59,536 --> 00:52:04,166
Hey! You remember when that kid
threw a beechnut right into red square?

580
00:52:04,374 --> 00:52:06,334
-Beechcraft.
-What?

581
00:52:06,543 --> 00:52:09,053
He flew a beechcraft,
not a beechnut.

582
00:52:09,254 --> 00:52:12,974
Beechcraft, beechnut,
beach blanket, beach ball, beach bum.

583
00:52:13,174 --> 00:52:17,724
What difference does it make?
He flew the plane right into red square.

584
00:52:17,762 --> 00:52:20,722
Remember those kids
at the video screens?

585
00:52:20,765 --> 00:52:24,055
What difference does it make
if it's real or false?

586
00:52:24,102 --> 00:52:27,732
It's all the same on the video screens.
It's just a game to them.

587
00:52:28,064 --> 00:52:32,994
It's warfare without a conscience.
It's the greatest concept ever known.

588
00:52:33,028 --> 00:52:38,068
It's brilliant. I'll rise like a Phoenix
on the ashes of greatness.

589
00:52:38,283 --> 00:52:42,873
Me, the greatest military genius
the world's ever known.

590
00:52:45,749 --> 00:52:50,839
Tomorrow we start building the littlest
armada known to mankind.

591
00:52:51,212 --> 00:52:55,632
Me,
Leland Helena zevo!

592
00:52:58,178 --> 00:53:02,268
Let that be a lesson to you.
Always carry a flare.

593
00:53:06,978 --> 00:53:10,608
I always feel like I'm witnessing
the last temptation of Barbie.

594
00:53:10,648 --> 00:53:13,108
Well, this model's
holding out nicely.

595
00:53:13,151 --> 00:53:17,861
The only way a child could pull this one
apart is if he took it to a tractor-pull.

596
00:53:19,866 --> 00:53:21,696
I just love that.

597
00:53:21,951 --> 00:53:23,831
-May I speak to you?
-Certainly.

598
00:53:23,870 --> 00:53:25,750
-In private?
-By all means.

599
00:53:25,789 --> 00:53:28,419
Carry on, Owen.

600
00:53:28,458 --> 00:53:32,088
General, for the first time in my life,
I've given some--

601
00:53:35,173 --> 00:53:40,553
why don't you watch where you're
going, you great egghead? Let's go.

602
00:53:40,595 --> 00:53:43,805
You should stop.
You'll be guilty of a hit-and-run.

603
00:53:44,099 --> 00:53:45,559
Always run when you've hit.

604
00:53:46,351 --> 00:53:49,941
I think it would be a terrible
mistake for us to make war toys.

605
00:53:49,979 --> 00:53:51,819
-Oh, you do, do you?
-Yes.

606
00:53:51,856 --> 00:53:53,936
We have a tradition
of whimsy here.

607
00:53:54,359 --> 00:54:00,119
Dad began that tradition, and it carries
all the way through the new line.

608
00:54:00,156 --> 00:54:04,656
To make us manufacture military toys
would be a philosophical contradiction.

609
00:54:04,703 --> 00:54:07,163
-I cannot support that.
-You're right.

610
00:54:07,205 --> 00:54:08,705
-I am?
-Absolutely.

611
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:12,460
-Absolutely.
-Thank you very much.

612
00:54:12,669 --> 00:54:16,379
I have to be honest. I thought
the war toy department was a good idea.

613
00:54:16,589 --> 00:54:18,879
But I see now it would take too long.

614
00:54:19,092 --> 00:54:22,722
It would be a difficult task
to establish a new department...

615
00:54:22,762 --> 00:54:27,392
...a bit like going against the grain.
Why tamper with tradition?

616
00:54:27,434 --> 00:54:32,404
-Well, that's my thinking exactly.
-Oh, hallelujah and goodbye.

617
00:54:33,314 --> 00:54:35,364
-You know what I'd like to do?
-What?

618
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,860
I'd like to have
more space to myself...

619
00:54:37,902 --> 00:54:39,902
-...develop my own toy ideas.
-Oh, ideas.

620
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:42,740
-Noodle about, as they say.
-Noodle?

621
00:54:42,866 --> 00:54:47,536
-Yes, just noodling.
-Well, I would like to noodle.

622
00:54:56,254 --> 00:54:57,964
-Hello.
-How's it going?

623
00:54:58,173 --> 00:55:01,343
Fine, fine. I might need
a little more space, though.

624
00:55:01,384 --> 00:55:05,224
-Okay. Sure. Go ahead.
-Thank you. Bye-bye.

625
00:55:16,649 --> 00:55:19,859
Going to need a teeny
bit more space.

626
00:55:20,612 --> 00:55:23,242
We're getting awfully
cramped in here.

627
00:55:25,075 --> 00:55:27,155
We're gonna need
that much more space.

628
00:55:34,209 --> 00:55:36,209
This is some
very innovative vomit.

629
00:55:36,586 --> 00:55:39,416
Except this one.
Looks like you could put maybe...

630
00:55:39,464 --> 00:55:42,554
...a piece of carrot and a pea
there to draw your eye to it.

631
00:55:42,717 --> 00:55:46,007
I agree with you. It should have
more consistency to it.

632
00:55:46,054 --> 00:55:50,644
Since your uncle started his project,
the budget for novelties has been cut.

633
00:55:50,850 --> 00:55:54,730
We don't have money for peas
and carrots? Come on, that is a classic.

634
00:55:54,771 --> 00:55:59,191
-Without it, it's not funny.
-No one's going to buy vomit without it.

635
00:55:59,234 --> 00:56:04,284
-What about noodles? They're cheap.
-Normally you don't see noodles in vomit.

636
00:56:04,322 --> 00:56:06,832
-Have you ever been to the pasta barn?
-No.

637
00:56:06,866 --> 00:56:12,496
In order to be competitive in the world,
we need more of an international nausea.

638
00:56:12,539 --> 00:56:15,999
Could we cater to Asian people?
That would make me very happy.

639
00:56:16,209 --> 00:56:20,629
This vomit is very ethnocentric. This is
obviously the vomit of the white man.

640
00:56:20,672 --> 00:56:23,682
-It's oppressive.
-We can have the teriyaki toss.

641
00:56:23,717 --> 00:56:27,637
-That's a bavarian blow.
-That's very interesting.

642
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:32,059
-It titillates me, and that's wrong.
-Yeah, this is almost like braille.

643
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:35,350
It appeals to a male market.
Is this room getting smaller?

644
00:56:35,395 --> 00:56:37,855
We're being attacked
by a crossword puzzle.

645
00:56:38,398 --> 00:56:41,648
-I like this one very much.
-That's our oktoberfest model...

646
00:56:41,693 --> 00:56:44,743
-...the brat splat.
-How'd it test?

647
00:56:44,904 --> 00:56:48,374
-Very well. 90 percent recommend it.
-What's the gag factor?

648
00:56:48,408 --> 00:56:50,578
-Instantaneous.
-We are working here!

649
00:56:50,827 --> 00:56:53,827
-What is this?
-That's a tofu toss.

650
00:56:53,872 --> 00:56:58,382
It's very nice. Why do we
have coconut and mushrooms here?

651
00:56:58,418 --> 00:57:02,508
-This is diarrhea. It doesn't belong here.
-Send it to the poop department.

652
00:57:02,547 --> 00:57:05,127
Is this--?
This is ham and pineapple.

653
00:57:05,175 --> 00:57:09,505
-We're calling that Maui chowie.
-That's very colorful. What's that?

654
00:57:09,554 --> 00:57:12,974
Duck sausage and cilantro.
We call it the Wolfgang Chuck.

655
00:57:13,016 --> 00:57:18,146
-There's the Wyatt urp. I love that one.
-We added okra. Now it's a Bible belch.

656
00:57:18,772 --> 00:57:20,482
What the hell is going on here?

657
00:57:22,025 --> 00:57:26,445
Sorry, the general needed more room.
Didn't mean to scare anyone.

658
00:57:26,654 --> 00:57:28,994
You guys need
to change your diet.

659
00:57:31,826 --> 00:57:34,496
Owen, how much room
does he need?

660
00:57:34,537 --> 00:57:38,417
It's not just a matter of space.
We're losing people every day.

661
00:57:38,458 --> 00:57:40,248
Some more designers just quit.

662
00:57:40,293 --> 00:57:43,513
What's he building?
Paul bunyan toys?

663
00:57:43,546 --> 00:57:47,546
I don't think it's a matter of working big.
Leslie, look down there.

664
00:57:48,009 --> 00:57:50,759
More of them arrive every day.

665
00:57:51,429 --> 00:57:55,639
He'd better be making something very
cute, or I'm going to be really annoyed.

666
00:57:57,769 --> 00:57:59,599
This is new.

667
00:58:35,557 --> 00:58:39,187
Dad? Daddy?

668
00:58:40,353 --> 00:58:44,733
Dad, where are you?
Dad?

669
00:58:45,442 --> 00:58:46,992
Dad?

670
00:58:49,029 --> 00:58:50,569
Dad?

671
00:58:52,949 --> 00:58:56,539
Daddy? Dad?

672
00:59:05,587 --> 00:59:08,167
Oh, daddy.

673
00:59:19,851 --> 00:59:24,941
Oh, daddy, I need you. The general
closed down my department...

674
00:59:24,981 --> 00:59:28,401
...and Owens is afraid,
and Leslie isn't doing anything...

675
00:59:28,443 --> 00:59:31,913
...and nobody knows what
anybody else is doing...

676
00:59:31,946 --> 00:59:36,236
...and there's all these new people,
and all these old people are quitting.

677
00:59:36,284 --> 00:59:40,214
Remember fay mackintaw, the one
who painted the lips on the alligators?

678
00:59:40,246 --> 00:59:43,826
Well, she's gone. Can you believe it?
Fay mackintaw's gone.

679
00:59:44,042 --> 00:59:48,252
If something doesn't happen really soon,
we're all gonna be in the shithouse.

680
00:59:49,756 --> 00:59:51,756
Alsatia?

681
00:59:54,427 --> 01:00:00,137
I think you know I don't use that
term very loosely. I most often mean it.

682
01:00:06,564 --> 01:00:09,154
Boy, those are great batteries.

683
01:00:09,609 --> 01:00:12,199
-Leslie....
-I know. I heard about it.

684
01:00:12,237 --> 01:00:15,527
-They closed down my office.
-I know.

685
01:00:16,032 --> 01:00:18,952
Are you going to
do something about it?

686
01:00:19,911 --> 01:00:21,451
Of course.

687
01:00:38,722 --> 01:00:42,392
What is happening here?
Alsatia's upset.

688
01:00:42,434 --> 01:00:45,524
She's so fragile.
I don't know what to do.

689
01:00:45,562 --> 01:00:50,362
I got him to stop making war toys, but
he is up to something. I wanna know.

690
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:54,860
I think we're a bit early for the parade.
Do you have enough helium?

691
01:00:54,904 --> 01:00:59,124
I like that one, Bob. Here it comes.
It's the incredible yuppie float.

692
01:01:02,162 --> 01:01:05,372
-Why don't you ask him?
-What do you mean?

693
01:01:06,541 --> 01:01:11,251
Why don't you go up to him and say,
"what are you doing?"

694
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:13,920
Get out of here.

695
01:01:14,507 --> 01:01:18,637
Just--? Just go up and ask
the general directly what he's doing?

696
01:01:18,678 --> 01:01:22,348
Cut through the fabric of our society
of obtuse and avoidance?

697
01:01:22,390 --> 01:01:26,020
I mean, where do you get off?
That is so out there.

698
01:01:26,061 --> 01:01:28,311
-You're making fun of me.
-No, I'm not.

699
01:01:28,355 --> 01:01:30,855
I need a glass of champagne.
Would you like one?

700
01:01:31,232 --> 01:01:33,742
-Yeah.
-Okay.

701
01:01:50,126 --> 01:01:52,166
How about a little
more champagne?

702
01:01:55,924 --> 01:01:59,264
Stick around. We may be
too tired to walk back.

703
01:01:59,302 --> 01:02:02,722
There you go.
Just a tad.

704
01:02:04,432 --> 01:02:09,562
Just a hair of the dog.
Toast? Melba.

705
01:02:11,272 --> 01:02:13,942
Your daddy was right.

706
01:02:13,983 --> 01:02:18,493
-What?
-He told me I'd like you.

707
01:02:18,738 --> 01:02:22,408
-You met my dad?
-He hired me.

708
01:02:24,953 --> 01:02:26,293
My father hired you?

709
01:02:28,915 --> 01:02:33,085
The day before he passed away.

710
01:02:35,964 --> 01:02:37,804
Handpicked.

711
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:43,930
I don't know why.
Maybe I do know why.

712
01:02:45,598 --> 01:02:50,188
-Pick a state.
-New York.

713
01:02:51,396 --> 01:02:55,606
Wrong.
Pick another one.

714
01:02:56,693 --> 01:02:59,743
-California.
-Really wrong.

715
01:03:06,619 --> 01:03:07,949
What the hell is that?

716
01:03:17,922 --> 01:03:19,472
Yes.

717
01:03:20,925 --> 01:03:24,795
This is a nice piece here.
This will be fine.

718
01:03:24,846 --> 01:03:30,016
You're absolutely right. I've got to walk
right up to him and ask what's going on.

719
01:03:30,602 --> 01:03:35,442
Tomorrow. He's busy right now.
Maybe I'll fax him.

720
01:03:37,609 --> 01:03:40,899
Damn! He spooked the horses.
We may have to walk back.

721
01:03:45,658 --> 01:03:48,498
General? General?

722
01:03:48,536 --> 01:03:50,656
-Hello.
-Excuse me, general.

723
01:03:50,705 --> 01:03:53,075
-I need some answers.
-Fire away, lad.

724
01:03:53,291 --> 01:03:55,961
-Will you tell me what's going on?
-No.

725
01:03:56,002 --> 01:03:59,092
-Would you give me a sneak preview?
-No.

726
01:03:59,130 --> 01:04:04,590
I don't want you to laugh at my efforts.
Me being a novice, so to speak.

727
01:04:04,636 --> 01:04:07,096
-I have to run along.
-Before you go...

728
01:04:07,138 --> 01:04:09,598
-...why are you hiring children?
-Children?

729
01:04:09,641 --> 01:04:11,941
-Little people.
-You saw little people?

730
01:04:11,976 --> 01:04:16,516
-I was looking down from my window--
-that's your angle. You're looking down.

731
01:04:16,564 --> 01:04:18,864
All I know is that they were little.

732
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:22,740
In the empire state building,
looking down, people look like ants.

733
01:04:22,779 --> 01:04:27,119
You're looking from the third-floor
window, people look very much smaller.

734
01:04:27,325 --> 01:04:28,905
General--

735
01:04:31,913 --> 01:04:35,963
see, Owen. I've got the security card.
Get us into the restricted area.

736
01:04:36,209 --> 01:04:38,709
-That's a coup!
-Isn't it? But the problem is...

737
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:42,470
...getting down that corridor
past the surveillance camera.

738
01:04:42,716 --> 01:04:44,126
Leslie.

739
01:04:45,135 --> 01:04:49,965
Have you any idea at all how
we're going to get down the corridor?

740
01:04:50,223 --> 01:04:53,313
Mtv. Mtv.

741
01:05:04,779 --> 01:05:08,619
Shimera, would you check if anyone
handed in my glasses?

742
01:05:08,950 --> 01:05:11,830
-I can't see a thing without them.
-Sure, Mr. Owens.

743
01:05:12,037 --> 01:05:14,707
Harvey, you wanna look
in your drawer too?

744
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:20,460
They have wire rims.

745
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:27,299
-Not here, Mr. Owens. Sorry.
-Thank you.

746
01:05:27,344 --> 01:05:30,314
Can't find his glasses.
Like they're in my drawer.

747
01:05:30,513 --> 01:05:34,683
<i>-Seaview, go ahead.
-We're under attack by--</i>

748
01:05:34,893 --> 01:05:38,653
<i>it looks like some kind of
mutated plant. It's enormous!</i>

749
01:05:38,688 --> 01:05:41,318
<i>We're gonna try to break loose.
Stand by.</i>

750
01:06:03,213 --> 01:06:05,223
<i>To less than 500 yards.</i>

751
01:06:05,256 --> 01:06:08,796
<i>Reduce speed to one-third
and stand by to reverse engines.</i>

752
01:06:24,818 --> 01:06:26,358
Who are they?

753
01:06:29,656 --> 01:06:31,566
It says, "yolanda and Steve."

754
01:06:38,623 --> 01:06:40,383
I think they're terrific.

755
01:07:14,325 --> 01:07:17,995
Wait a minute. If this is regular TV,
then what is this?

756
01:07:18,496 --> 01:07:22,706
Mtv.
I think it's patched into the cable.

757
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:26,461
-How did we get patched into cable?
-I don't know.

758
01:07:50,820 --> 01:07:54,120
-I bet they're lip-synching.
-No, this looks like real.

759
01:07:54,157 --> 01:07:56,197
They all lip-synch.
They can't sing.

760
01:08:21,726 --> 01:08:26,856
-Wanna dance?
-Sure. With her, maybe.

761
01:08:47,752 --> 01:08:53,172
My god.
F.A.O. Schwarzkopf.

762
01:09:50,648 --> 01:09:53,778
Hi, I'm new here.

763
01:09:53,818 --> 01:09:58,158
-What you been blowing up?
-A military base.

764
01:09:58,323 --> 01:10:01,123
What type of things
at the military base?

765
01:10:01,701 --> 01:10:05,831
People, army tanks and helicopters.

766
01:10:07,248 --> 01:10:12,168
-How many points do you get for people?
-Thousand.

767
01:10:29,562 --> 01:10:32,942
Oh, man. Break-in, restricted area.

768
01:10:32,982 --> 01:10:35,402
Everybody move it!
Let's go!

769
01:10:56,256 --> 01:10:58,756
Don't panic.
Stay calm.

770
01:11:22,907 --> 01:11:26,577
What the hell is that? What's in here?
Help!

771
01:11:28,371 --> 01:11:32,041
-Secure all the exits.
-Level 3.

772
01:11:33,209 --> 01:11:36,959
-Who breached security?
-The water tank's been activated.

773
01:11:37,297 --> 01:11:42,177
Help!
Help! Patrick!

774
01:11:42,427 --> 01:11:43,717
What is in here with me?

775
01:11:44,346 --> 01:11:50,186
-Should I deactivate the sea swine, sir?
-Oh, yes, you deactivate the sea swine!

776
01:11:50,393 --> 01:11:52,813
Don't move!
It operates by vibrations.

777
01:11:53,396 --> 01:11:55,856
What the hell is that?

778
01:11:58,318 --> 01:12:01,858
Shut it down, hogenstern.
Don't move. Hogenstern, shut it down.

779
01:12:01,905 --> 01:12:04,985
Don't touch anything!
I want to see if this baby works.

780
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:13,710
-Does it want to eat me or mate with me?
-Shut it down, hogenstern.

781
01:12:13,833 --> 01:12:17,843
-Leslie, don't move!
-That's nuts! I'll drown if I don't move!

782
01:12:17,879 --> 01:12:21,299
-That's it. I'm out of here.
-Leslie, I said, don't move.

783
01:12:23,051 --> 01:12:25,641
Oh, god.
Get away from me!

784
01:12:27,681 --> 01:12:30,481
That showed it.
There, that showed--

785
01:12:31,893 --> 01:12:35,813
-it works! I told you it would work.
-Leslie!

786
01:12:36,606 --> 01:12:39,936
-You playing around?
-I have to talk to the Washington boys.

787
01:12:39,984 --> 01:12:42,704
-The time has come.
-Leslie, you playing around?

788
01:12:43,071 --> 01:12:45,621
Whose side are you on anyway?

789
01:12:47,951 --> 01:12:49,581
Leslie?

790
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:15,477
Gwen.

791
01:13:17,439 --> 01:13:19,019
Gwen.

792
01:13:19,232 --> 01:13:23,952
-You're all wet. Is it raining?
-No, showers expected later this evening.

793
01:13:23,987 --> 01:13:28,657
-There's a madman at the factory.
-What? You wanna tell me about it?

794
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:32,200
Well, alsatia and I broke into
the restricted area.

795
01:13:32,245 --> 01:13:34,325
I saw children playing video games.

796
01:13:34,372 --> 01:13:37,332
And there was this thing
that tried to kill me.

797
01:13:37,375 --> 01:13:39,535
I'm warming myself in front
of a fake fire.

798
01:13:41,212 --> 01:13:47,222
-Something is not right. It's very wrong.
-What is wrong? What happened?

799
01:13:47,260 --> 01:13:50,680
I found a room full of children playing
video games. Actually, war games.

800
01:13:50,889 --> 01:13:53,019
<i>You get 1000 points
for blowing up a person.</i>

801
01:13:53,058 --> 01:13:55,188
<i>All of a sudden
this alarm goes off.</i>

802
01:13:55,226 --> 01:13:58,516
<i>I run down this hallway,
and it says, "restricted."</i>

803
01:13:58,563 --> 01:14:01,273
<i>And I fall into a pool!
We're not zoned for a pool.</i>

804
01:14:01,524 --> 01:14:06,614
-<i>I mean, when did they get a pool?</i>
-Capt. Zevo. Capt. Zevo, come in.

805
01:14:06,654 --> 01:14:09,824
-<i>This is capt. Zevo. Come in, Baker.</i>
-Can I have your position?

806
01:14:09,866 --> 01:14:12,576
That's an inappropriate question
at this time, Baker.

807
01:14:12,619 --> 01:14:15,869
-<i>We have a position on Leslie, sir.</i>
-Report, please.

808
01:14:15,914 --> 01:14:20,924
-He's at the residence of miss Tyler.
-Out.

809
01:14:33,682 --> 01:14:36,892
<i>-Okay. It's okay.
-Okay. Okay, breathe. Breathe.</i>

810
01:14:37,227 --> 01:14:40,607
Oh, yes. Come to <i>papi </i>now.

811
01:14:40,647 --> 01:14:43,017
Yeah.

812
01:14:43,066 --> 01:14:45,356
<i>Oh, thanks. Thank you.</i>

813
01:14:45,402 --> 01:14:48,452
I hope you don't think this is pushy.

814
01:14:49,197 --> 01:14:51,527
Do you mind if I spent the night?

815
01:14:59,290 --> 01:15:02,790
Yeah. Looks like it's getting on.
Yeah.

816
01:15:02,836 --> 01:15:06,416
Cut to the chase, Ace.
Yeah, there it is. It's on now.

817
01:15:06,464 --> 01:15:08,594
Come on, les.

818
01:15:09,968 --> 01:15:13,098
-It's all right now. It's all right.
-Go for it, les.

819
01:15:13,138 --> 01:15:15,428
Wait, what happened?

820
01:15:16,474 --> 01:15:20,314
-Fix it, man. That was getting hot, man.
-I can't do anything.

821
01:15:20,353 --> 01:15:22,443
-You're always messing up.
-I didn't do nothing!

822
01:15:26,443 --> 01:15:29,743
-Did you bring the manual?
-This doesn't come with a manual.

823
01:15:29,779 --> 01:15:31,869
Listen.

824
01:15:41,041 --> 01:15:42,831
-Listen to it.
-Listen to it.

825
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:04,560
Yo, what is that?

826
01:16:06,691 --> 01:16:08,821
Yo, what was that?

827
01:16:13,323 --> 01:16:16,583
-What's going on here?
-Nothing. Nothing's going on.

828
01:16:16,618 --> 01:16:19,498
-Actually, I think they're sleeping.
-What does he know?

829
01:16:19,704 --> 01:16:24,384
I don't think he's seen enough, at least
not enough to make any sense out of it.

830
01:16:24,417 --> 01:16:27,837
We're making arrangements to meet
with Washington to discuss...

831
01:16:27,879 --> 01:16:29,509
...the general's new military.

832
01:16:29,547 --> 01:16:33,927
I want it to be maximum security. We're
lucky Leslie didn't find out anything.

833
01:16:33,968 --> 01:16:37,718
For this meeting, I want maximum
surveillance on neutral ground.

834
01:16:37,764 --> 01:16:39,564
-You get that?
-Got it.

835
01:16:39,599 --> 01:16:41,059
What the hell is this?

836
01:16:42,060 --> 01:16:45,690
We taped that off the
corridor monitor, sir.

837
01:16:45,730 --> 01:16:48,730
We like it.
Steve and yolanda, they're great.

838
01:16:48,775 --> 01:16:51,395
-Yolanda and Steve.
-Yolanda and Steve, sir.

839
01:16:51,444 --> 01:16:55,414
If you want your mtv, soldier,
you better want it on your own time.

840
01:16:55,448 --> 01:16:57,278
I told him we shouldn't
be watching, sir.

841
01:17:01,204 --> 01:17:06,134
Tell me, what exactly happened?
Did something actually kill you?

842
01:17:06,376 --> 01:17:11,456
Now, you saw big bulging eyes
in the water...

843
01:17:11,506 --> 01:17:13,296
...bulging eyes.

844
01:17:13,341 --> 01:17:17,471
-Something was coming after you.
-Yes. They were bulging eyes...

845
01:17:17,512 --> 01:17:20,562
...or they might have been balls.
There was something big...

846
01:17:20,598 --> 01:17:23,228
...pulsating in the water,
and it wasn't me.

847
01:17:23,601 --> 01:17:27,981
Well, what can I say?
How can I alleviate this doubt?

848
01:17:28,023 --> 01:17:29,403
Why was Patrick so concerned?

849
01:17:29,441 --> 01:17:32,241
Why was he yelling, "shut it down,
hogenstern. Don't move, Leslie"?

850
01:17:32,277 --> 01:17:34,567
-Why was he yelling that?
-Because you might have broken it.

851
01:17:35,155 --> 01:17:36,275
Broken it?

852
01:17:36,322 --> 01:17:39,582
We haven't tested it yet
to make sure it's childproof.

853
01:17:39,617 --> 01:17:42,117
Leslie, anything else?

854
01:17:42,162 --> 01:17:44,752
Yeah, I want to know why he looks
like a Russian Ralph kramden.

855
01:17:44,789 --> 01:17:46,789
That was a highly restricted area.

856
01:17:46,833 --> 01:17:50,923
You scared us half to death in there,
faking that you had drowned.

857
01:17:50,962 --> 01:17:55,052
-What exactly are you working on?
-A wonderful, new water toy.

858
01:17:55,091 --> 01:17:56,631
-Oh, a tub toy.
-Yes.

859
01:17:56,676 --> 01:18:01,846
I have some terrific video games for kids.
We've talked about that. It's tedious.

860
01:18:01,890 --> 01:18:04,100
Well, let us see them.
I'd love to see them.

861
01:18:04,309 --> 01:18:07,899
-Wouldn't it be nice to have a tour?
-Oh, yes, a tour would be very nice.

862
01:18:08,438 --> 01:18:09,858
I tell you what.

863
01:18:09,898 --> 01:18:12,358
Give me two weeks
to put my house in order...

864
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:16,320
...get my ducks in a row, so to speak,
and I'll be more than willing...

865
01:18:16,363 --> 01:18:20,743
-...to show you my work. Okay?
-Okay.

866
01:18:22,952 --> 01:18:24,702
Sir!

867
01:18:28,416 --> 01:18:31,706
-Patrick!
-Dad. Don't mind that.

868
01:18:31,753 --> 01:18:35,723
-Just a diversionary tactic.
-Marvelous.

869
01:18:35,757 --> 01:18:39,927
-The Washington boys are set.
-The Washington boys?

870
01:18:40,428 --> 01:18:44,218
It's done. Thursday, 1600 hours.

871
01:18:44,265 --> 01:18:49,265
My moment in the sun.
Break out the zinc oxide!

872
01:19:11,418 --> 01:19:14,248
Leland, I understand
the need for security...

873
01:19:14,295 --> 01:19:16,795
...but don't you think this
is a little extreme?

874
01:19:29,728 --> 01:19:31,688
Look at this.
You can see right through them.

875
01:19:31,896 --> 01:19:34,856
Look like they got halos on them,
like little, bony angels.

876
01:19:34,899 --> 01:19:37,069
-That's the general there, right?
-Yeah.

877
01:19:37,110 --> 01:19:40,490
Don't waste any time on him.
We know he doesn't have a wire.

878
01:19:40,530 --> 01:19:44,160
Move over to the Washington boys,
tegnell and magraw.

879
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:47,290
They definitely don't have to work out.

880
01:19:51,207 --> 01:19:53,167
Look. Hey, look right here.

881
01:19:53,209 --> 01:19:56,089
I think we got a bug, my man.
See right there?

882
01:19:56,129 --> 01:20:00,089
No, no, no. That's some kind of
shrapnel or something like that.

883
01:20:00,133 --> 01:20:02,183
-Shrapnel.
-Shrapnel. Shrapnel.

884
01:20:02,218 --> 01:20:03,468
Shrapnel.

885
01:20:03,511 --> 01:20:05,641
How are you feeling since
your operation, magraw?

886
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:10,230
Not too bad. But I'm getting a few
chest pains that I didn't have before.

887
01:20:10,268 --> 01:20:14,058
It looks like scissors or something,
you know, like a clamp.

888
01:20:14,105 --> 01:20:18,605
Well, let's not tell him.
Move over to the tegnell now.

889
01:20:18,651 --> 01:20:22,071
<i>Well, gentlemen, is it everything
i told you it would be?</i>

890
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:24,530
<i>A miniaturized military.</i>

891
01:20:24,574 --> 01:20:28,584
<i>Remote-control planes being
operated by kids on video screens?</i>

892
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:32,670
You know, the Israelis have been flying
model planes with video cameras...

893
01:20:32,707 --> 01:20:36,537
...attached to do surveillance.
It might not be a bad idea.

894
01:20:36,586 --> 01:20:39,546
<i>Leland, we're gonna have to
go back to Washington...</i>

895
01:20:39,589 --> 01:20:41,219
<i>...with your proposal
for discussion.</i>

896
01:20:41,508 --> 01:20:46,598
<i>You've gotta look to the future.
The future is anarchy.</i>

897
01:20:46,638 --> 01:20:50,268
<i>-What are you talking about?
-I'm talking about lawlessness.</i>

898
01:20:50,308 --> 01:20:53,598
<i>I'm talking about the
lebanons of the future.</i>

899
01:20:53,645 --> 01:20:56,605
<i>I'm talking about the breakdown
of the whole system.</i>

900
01:20:56,648 --> 01:20:59,938
<i>The military defending
people against people.</i>

901
01:20:59,984 --> 01:21:02,784
<i>You won't get your appropriations
waving that flag.</i>

902
01:21:02,987 --> 01:21:06,067
<i>There's no glory
in that kind of warfare.</i>

903
01:21:06,116 --> 01:21:10,696
How can you possibly justify
that one stealth bomber costs more...

904
01:21:10,745 --> 01:21:15,705
<i>...than the government spends on cancer
research in the whole United States?</i>

905
01:21:15,750 --> 01:21:20,090
But 1 million little planes
at $5000 apiece?

906
01:21:20,338 --> 01:21:24,218
<i>-You see what I'm saying?
-Well, I think this is something...</i>

907
01:21:24,259 --> 01:21:26,549
...we'll have to review
and discuss further.

908
01:21:26,594 --> 01:21:30,774
What's to review? What's to discuss?
This is the program! This is what works!

909
01:21:30,974 --> 01:21:33,234
-This is the future!
-Dad.

910
01:21:33,268 --> 01:21:34,638
All I'm trying to say...

911
01:21:34,686 --> 01:21:37,766
<i>-...is calm down.
-Don't tell me to calm down!</i>

912
01:21:37,981 --> 01:21:41,741
<i>-Don't tell me to calm down!
-Are you crazy? Get off of me!</i>

913
01:21:41,776 --> 01:21:43,276
<i>Get off! Get him off!</i>

914
01:21:47,073 --> 01:21:50,203
<i>Dad! Come on!</i>

915
01:23:23,962 --> 01:23:25,092
Anything wrong, sir?

916
01:23:25,964 --> 01:23:28,264
No, just a fly.

917
01:23:28,883 --> 01:23:31,513
Wouldn't it be better
to use a fly swatter, sir?

918
01:23:39,936 --> 01:23:42,226
Yes.

919
01:23:44,566 --> 01:23:50,406
Those Washington boys,
they didn't bother to call back.

920
01:23:52,365 --> 01:23:57,785
They think I don't know what I'm doing.
I'll soon show them.

921
01:24:01,791 --> 01:24:05,301
Medic!

922
01:24:09,799 --> 01:24:13,259
Hello. I missed you, honey.

923
01:24:13,303 --> 01:24:17,023
-Where you been?
-You know that's classified.

924
01:24:17,724 --> 01:24:20,524
Don't you think we should
announce our engagement?

925
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:22,770
We always have to keep
everything a big secret.

926
01:24:22,812 --> 01:24:24,982
-Soon. Very soon.
-Yeah?

927
01:24:25,190 --> 01:24:28,570
For now, let's have a different
kind of engagement. Yeah.

928
01:24:28,610 --> 01:24:31,780
-Oh, Leland.
-What?

929
01:24:32,113 --> 01:24:35,913
-You said, "Leland."
-I said, Leland? You must be mistaken. I--

930
01:24:35,950 --> 01:24:40,870
-oh, you called me Leland.
-No, I said, "lean in." You know, lean in.

931
01:24:40,914 --> 01:24:43,504
Debbie. Debbie.

932
01:24:43,708 --> 01:24:47,378
You didn't do my dad, did you?

933
01:24:47,420 --> 01:24:48,590
-Well....
-Did you?

934
01:24:48,630 --> 01:24:50,420
-It was an accident.
-It was an accident.

935
01:24:50,465 --> 01:24:53,215
You were away, and he was
having these bouts of depression.

936
01:24:53,259 --> 01:24:55,849
Because he gets a little depressed,
you--? God almighty, Debbie!

937
01:24:55,887 --> 01:24:59,347
Wait, let me explain to you.
You don't know how tragic it is.

938
01:24:59,391 --> 01:25:02,891
He goes on and on about the fact that he
was responsible for your mother's death.

939
01:25:02,936 --> 01:25:06,606
I know, I know. Appendicitis.
Appendicitis.

940
01:25:06,648 --> 01:25:09,228
-How could you?
-What do you mean, "appendicitis"?

941
01:25:09,275 --> 01:25:11,645
My mother died
from appendicitis, Debbie.

942
01:25:12,404 --> 01:25:14,494
He sent her on
a reconnaissance mission.

943
01:25:15,031 --> 01:25:16,991
-Reconnaissance?
-Yeah.

944
01:25:17,033 --> 01:25:19,243
You know how Jane Fonda visited Hanoi?

945
01:25:19,285 --> 01:25:21,865
He sent your mother in, disguised
as a Jane Fonda look-alike...

946
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:23,120
...and something happened.

947
01:25:49,399 --> 01:25:53,069
What does the man know about toys,
mother Teresa? He has no sense of fun.

948
01:25:53,111 --> 01:25:55,861
He has a heart of spam.

949
01:25:55,905 --> 01:25:57,945
How can he come up with a design
better than ours?

950
01:25:58,158 --> 01:25:59,828
We've been doing it for 50 years.

951
01:25:59,868 --> 01:26:01,618
I don't know. Give me some soup.

952
01:26:01,661 --> 01:26:05,081
Okay. What do you think, Owen?

953
01:26:05,123 --> 01:26:08,713
Well, we'll be able to see
in a couple of weeks.

954
01:26:08,752 --> 01:26:10,592
Why two weeks?

955
01:26:10,628 --> 01:26:14,088
That's a good question.
That's a very good question.

956
01:26:14,132 --> 01:26:17,472
<i>You wanna know
what the general's building?</i>

957
01:26:23,808 --> 01:26:25,638
A deadly war machine.

958
01:26:28,146 --> 01:26:34,566
He is so good! He's the best.
That red is a hard color to match.

959
01:26:35,362 --> 01:26:37,782
You want the truth?
I'll tell you the truth.

960
01:26:42,952 --> 01:26:44,702
<i>And nothing but the truth.</i>

961
01:26:45,121 --> 01:26:48,711
We have a breach of security.
Call the general.

962
01:26:50,418 --> 01:26:52,418
Never liked him anyway.

963
01:26:52,462 --> 01:26:55,132
I knew he'd defect, that boy.
I knew it.

964
01:26:55,465 --> 01:26:58,925
One word about his mother
and he goes soft like a little kid!

965
01:27:31,793 --> 01:27:35,093
<i>It's not just a game. Those lethal
weapons he's building...</i>

966
01:27:35,130 --> 01:27:37,630
-<i>...in the factory are just phase one.</i>
-Phase one?

967
01:27:37,674 --> 01:27:41,094
Yeah. He wants to build a new
technology for tomorrow's warriors.

968
01:27:41,136 --> 01:27:44,636
<i>-Oh, my god.
-It would start as a philanthropic gesture.</i>

969
01:27:44,681 --> 01:27:47,601
<i>He would establish daycare centers
in poverty areas.</i>

970
01:27:47,642 --> 01:27:49,522
<i>Mothers could leave their
children there...</i>

971
01:27:49,561 --> 01:27:52,271
<i>...and they'd be taught to read
and write by video computer.</i>

972
01:27:52,313 --> 01:27:54,153
<i>-What's the trick?
-To educate them.</i>

973
01:27:54,190 --> 01:27:57,940
<i>But at the same time, to create
a special variety of video game to...</i>

974
01:27:57,986 --> 01:28:01,736
...develop coordination. Teach the child
how to handle sophisticated equipment:

975
01:28:01,781 --> 01:28:06,661
Simulated flight experiences, visual laser
lock-on screens. And that last step...

976
01:28:06,703 --> 01:28:11,623
...the final frontier, is to fly a real combat
mission with remote-control weaponry.

977
01:28:11,666 --> 01:28:14,286
The kids don't know the difference.
They think it's a video game.

978
01:28:14,336 --> 01:28:17,796
They think they're racking up points and
they're actually wiping out whole cities.

979
01:28:17,839 --> 01:28:20,509
He's gotta be stopped.
We have to call the police.

980
01:28:20,550 --> 01:28:22,340
<i>-No. No police.
-Why?</i>

981
01:28:22,510 --> 01:28:27,560
Because this is family business. What's
been done has got to be undone. Right?

982
01:28:27,599 --> 01:28:30,269
-We're gonna take care of it.
-But how can we do it?

983
01:28:30,310 --> 01:28:36,270
<i>I put the entire security system in.
With your help, I can take it out.</i>

984
01:28:37,359 --> 01:28:40,899
Well, well, well.
Look what we've got here.

985
01:28:40,945 --> 01:28:42,605
A mutiny.

986
01:28:42,655 --> 01:28:45,405
First of all, we gotta be a unit.
We can't all talk at the same time.

987
01:28:45,450 --> 01:28:50,500
We gotta be one mind, one body, one
goal, one soul. Stand up and join me.

988
01:28:53,917 --> 01:28:56,627
He's very good, isn't he?

989
01:28:58,129 --> 01:29:03,549
<i>We are now one
in body, in soul, in dedication.</i>

990
01:29:03,593 --> 01:29:05,763
<i>We have one thought alone:
Victory.</i>

991
01:29:05,804 --> 01:29:10,274
Put this place on red alert.
They're as good as dead.

992
01:29:10,475 --> 01:29:15,225
-That's your son, sir.
-War has no relatives.

993
01:29:15,271 --> 01:29:19,361
Now, we're gonna get them.
And we're gonna get them good.

994
01:29:38,003 --> 01:29:40,593
War.

995
01:29:44,467 --> 01:29:46,257
All right, sir. They're here.

996
01:29:46,928 --> 01:29:52,768
And so it begins. Now is my time.

997
01:29:52,809 --> 01:29:58,819
It was not Korea, it was not Vietnam,
but now...

998
01:29:58,857 --> 01:30:03,647
...tonight, on this battleground,
this field of innocence...

999
01:30:03,695 --> 01:30:08,115
...this shall be my finest hour.

1000
01:30:08,158 --> 01:30:12,658
I can almost hear the ticking
of the second hand of destiny.

1001
01:30:12,704 --> 01:30:14,464
A moment.

1002
01:30:14,497 --> 01:30:19,087
One wonderful moment
when fate takes your hand.

1003
01:30:19,127 --> 01:30:22,087
And this is my moment.

1004
01:30:36,394 --> 01:30:38,694
Patrick took out
the surveillance system, sir.

1005
01:30:39,647 --> 01:30:44,647
Turn on the twin system.
Not even Patrick knew about that.

1006
01:30:44,694 --> 01:30:47,204
I trust no one.

1007
01:30:59,709 --> 01:31:01,999
Let the games begin.

1008
01:31:31,533 --> 01:31:33,283
That's the sea swine down there.

1009
01:31:37,372 --> 01:31:41,212
Sea swine pit.
They're just passing that now.

1010
01:31:41,251 --> 01:31:44,171
-See that?
-Sea swine, sea swine.

1011
01:31:44,212 --> 01:31:46,262
This is how it's gonna go down.

1012
01:31:46,297 --> 01:31:50,757
I'm gonna shut down the control centers,
make sure the weapons are deactivated.

1013
01:31:50,802 --> 01:31:55,522
I want you to meet me at the Manhattan
model in five minutes. Let's move.

1014
01:31:55,557 --> 01:31:56,847
Five minutes.

1015
01:31:57,350 --> 01:31:59,770
Patrick!
We don't know which way!

1016
01:32:04,691 --> 01:32:08,491
-Shall we hit them now, sir?
-Let them separate a little more.

1017
01:32:10,488 --> 01:32:13,578
-Leslie?
-Owen!

1018
01:32:13,616 --> 01:32:16,866
It's this way. Yeah, I know.

1019
01:32:16,911 --> 01:32:18,911
Leslie!

1020
01:32:18,955 --> 01:32:21,455
-Déjà vu.
-Alsatia!

1021
01:32:24,711 --> 01:32:28,011
All right. Hit them.

1022
01:32:31,009 --> 01:32:33,299
I wonder what the flashing
red lights mean?

1023
01:32:33,345 --> 01:32:39,635
Well, red usually means caution
or beef, if it's a bouillon cube.

1024
01:32:39,684 --> 01:32:41,484
Thank you, alsatia. That helps a lot.

1025
01:32:41,519 --> 01:32:43,809
I know where I'm going,
i just don't know how to get there.

1026
01:32:43,855 --> 01:32:45,145
Maybe that's the covert way,
not to tell you.

1027
01:32:45,190 --> 01:32:47,940
-We need a helper or some fruit.
-Hey, y'all, look.

1028
01:32:47,984 --> 01:32:51,454
Thank you, alsatia. Okay.

1029
01:32:52,322 --> 01:32:57,792
-Good. A place with only one corridor.
-<i>Select floor now.</i>

1030
01:32:59,662 --> 01:33:02,752
Oh, look! Isn't that adorable?

1031
01:33:05,210 --> 01:33:07,550
<i>Stand clear of the door.</i>

1032
01:33:12,384 --> 01:33:14,144
-Isn't that great?
-Yes, sir.

1033
01:33:15,053 --> 01:33:17,393
<i>Doors closing now.</i>

1034
01:33:22,936 --> 01:33:25,896
<i>Going down now.</i>

1035
01:33:27,023 --> 01:33:30,403
That's a very bad baby.

1036
01:33:32,237 --> 01:33:35,027
Patrick must be at the control center.

1037
01:34:47,187 --> 01:34:49,267
Ball and Dolly just killed each other.

1038
01:34:59,157 --> 01:35:03,197
Put in the Tommy tanks,
and activate the hurly-burly helicopters.

1039
01:35:16,257 --> 01:35:19,337
The man's insane.
He's building fatalistic toys.

1040
01:35:19,386 --> 01:35:21,846
Why couldn't I see it coming? I saw
the warnings in the restricted area...

1041
01:35:21,888 --> 01:35:24,518
...i fell in the pool, something tried
to kill me. I really screwed up.

1042
01:35:26,559 --> 01:35:28,809
-I thought I'd lost you.
-The general knows we're here.

1043
01:35:28,853 --> 01:35:31,693
-How do you know?
-Well....

1044
01:35:33,983 --> 01:35:35,033
I rest my case!

1045
01:36:10,812 --> 01:36:16,232
This way. This way. This way.
In here! This way!

1046
01:36:23,825 --> 01:36:26,035
I don't understand!
How do they work?

1047
01:36:26,077 --> 01:36:29,077
Everywhere we go, there they are.
They must follow movement.

1048
01:36:29,122 --> 01:36:30,212
Where's Patrick?

1049
01:36:34,878 --> 01:36:37,458
Go, now, go!

1050
01:36:39,549 --> 01:36:41,549
Move it!

1051
01:36:50,352 --> 01:36:53,232
We're in the old warehouse.

1052
01:36:53,438 --> 01:36:58,648
Look, Leslie. This is where the
general stuck all the old toys.

1053
01:36:58,693 --> 01:37:00,863
Everything that zevo was is here.

1054
01:37:02,572 --> 01:37:05,282
-Dance with me.
-Not now.

1055
01:37:05,492 --> 01:37:09,412
Look at that!
They've let themselves get trapped!

1056
01:37:09,454 --> 01:37:12,174
That means Patrick must be in there.

1057
01:37:12,207 --> 01:37:15,337
That's not like him to make
such a poor tactical maneuver.

1058
01:37:15,377 --> 01:37:17,797
I used to love to play with these.

1059
01:37:17,837 --> 01:37:21,877
The general's weapons track movement--
do you think these would still work?

1060
01:37:22,092 --> 01:37:24,762
Oh, if you wind them up,
i imagine they will.

1061
01:37:24,803 --> 01:37:28,103
-I've got an idea.
-What?

1062
01:37:28,139 --> 01:37:30,979
We're gonna fight fire
with marshmallows.

1063
01:37:31,017 --> 01:37:32,807
That's a complete answer.

1064
01:37:32,852 --> 01:37:35,402
Ladies and gentlemen...

1065
01:37:36,398 --> 01:37:39,028
...our army.

1066
01:37:39,401 --> 01:37:41,361
Let's wind up the troops.

1067
01:37:41,403 --> 01:37:43,913
-Someone get me a cup of tea.
-Greenberg.

1068
01:37:44,114 --> 01:37:46,994
-<i>Yes, sir?</i>
-Tea for the general. Eight lumps.

1069
01:37:50,412 --> 01:37:53,372
Sorry it's come to this.

1070
01:37:53,415 --> 01:37:55,915
Who would believe when we made
Milton the friendly elephant...

1071
01:37:56,126 --> 01:37:58,996
...that some of you today
would be wound in anger?

1072
01:37:59,045 --> 01:38:02,715
Four stores and many christmases ago,
my father brought forth a factory...

1073
01:38:02,757 --> 01:38:08,007
...conceived in innocence and joy,
in squeezable fun for everyone.

1074
01:38:09,556 --> 01:38:15,476
But today may be the beginning
of the end. Or the end of the beginning.

1075
01:38:15,687 --> 01:38:18,107
Or the beginning of the beguine.

1076
01:38:18,565 --> 01:38:23,395
And when you go forth today, or fifth,
depending on your order in line...

1077
01:38:23,445 --> 01:38:27,985
...we are here today
to put you in harm's way.

1078
01:38:28,199 --> 01:38:32,579
Because we determine today,
in this warehouse...

1079
01:38:32,620 --> 01:38:36,080
...the future of toys as we know it.

1080
01:38:36,124 --> 01:38:40,304
Whether it'll be
toys of fun and innocence...

1081
01:38:40,337 --> 01:38:43,337
...or toys for total tot-warfare.

1082
01:38:43,381 --> 01:38:47,931
Mr. penguin, if you don't do it today,
you're an endangered species.

1083
01:38:47,969 --> 01:38:49,469
You know that.

1084
01:38:49,679 --> 01:38:52,429
Now, many of you have
never seen your own fluff.

1085
01:38:53,058 --> 01:38:55,688
Many of you are just out of the boxes.

1086
01:38:55,727 --> 01:38:57,937
You've never seen your own
Springs lying on the ground...

1087
01:38:57,979 --> 01:39:00,359
...but I tell you today,
that's not gonna be the case.

1088
01:39:00,398 --> 01:39:04,358
I want you to Wade into them.
I want them to spill their batteries.

1089
01:39:04,402 --> 01:39:06,612
I want them to break off
their antennae.

1090
01:39:06,654 --> 01:39:10,834
I want those plastic behemoths
to be a bubbling box of goo.

1091
01:39:11,076 --> 01:39:15,366
In the words of Barbie, "i had a dream
house." I know you can do it.

1092
01:39:15,413 --> 01:39:18,883
Spin your balls, move your plates,
skip your ropes.

1093
01:39:18,917 --> 01:39:23,337
Mr. twirly, blind them with the best you
can. In the words of mahatma gumby:

1094
01:39:23,380 --> 01:39:28,930
"We are toys of tolerance, but there's
only so much that a toy can tolerate."

1095
01:39:28,968 --> 01:39:33,348
Do what you must,
you simple, gentle few...

1096
01:39:33,390 --> 01:39:38,650
...for I would rather have you by my side
than any remote-control gadget...

1097
01:39:38,687 --> 01:39:40,057
...that I've ever seen.

1098
01:39:40,230 --> 01:39:45,150
Because you are-- and even you. Even
you, alien al. Pay a little attention...

1099
01:39:45,193 --> 01:39:49,323
...because you were never a big seller,
but we stood by you.

1100
01:39:49,364 --> 01:39:52,664
So now is the time not to ask
what zevo can do for you...

1101
01:39:52,701 --> 01:39:54,741
...but what you can do for zevo.

1102
01:39:55,704 --> 01:40:01,174
Let's all Bob our heads for a brief
moment of prayer. Those who can.

1103
01:40:11,928 --> 01:40:13,968
-You all right, alsatia?
-Yeah.

1104
01:40:14,014 --> 01:40:17,064
They attacked us while we were
at prayer. It's like Pearl harbor.

1105
01:40:18,727 --> 01:40:22,727
Stay calm.
Hold until you see the lights in their eyes.

1106
01:40:41,166 --> 01:40:45,626
For dad, zevo and Milton
the friendly elephant!

1107
01:40:45,670 --> 01:40:50,340
Now!

1108
01:40:55,305 --> 01:41:01,135
<i>He's at the 30-yard line. He's running
like crazy. He's all alone out there!</i>

1109
01:42:29,357 --> 01:42:33,237
Look at that score.

1110
01:42:33,278 --> 01:42:34,858
Oh, boy. We're up!

1111
01:43:05,518 --> 01:43:06,598
<i>Warning! Warning!</i>

1112
01:43:19,115 --> 01:43:21,695
-I love this game!
-Oh, I think it's over.

1113
01:43:40,011 --> 01:43:44,021
Something's happened to Patrick.
I've gotta get to Manhattan.

1114
01:43:58,029 --> 01:44:02,079
Keep the diversion going.
I'm gonna find a way to stop this.

1115
01:44:02,117 --> 01:44:07,117
Hurry up, Leslie,
the mice are going awol!

1116
01:44:47,954 --> 01:44:51,834
That must be Leslie!
How the hell did he get there?

1117
01:44:52,334 --> 01:44:55,964
-Look, sir, the Tommy tank is on his tail.
-Not good enough.

1118
01:44:59,382 --> 01:45:02,642
-Activate the sea swine.
-Sir, it's not too reliable.

1119
01:45:02,677 --> 01:45:04,217
Activate it!

1120
01:45:04,262 --> 01:45:06,772
<i>Sea swine activating now.</i>

1121
01:45:06,806 --> 01:45:08,976
Switch it over for amphibious attack.

1122
01:45:09,142 --> 01:45:13,612
<i>Sea swine in
amphibious attack mode now.</i>

1123
01:45:43,843 --> 01:45:46,183
Patrick!

1124
01:45:50,850 --> 01:45:52,270
Patrick!

1125
01:45:52,644 --> 01:45:54,734
Here!

1126
01:45:55,021 --> 01:45:58,481
-Patrick, where are you?
-Fifth Avenue, Tiffany's.

1127
01:45:58,608 --> 01:46:00,278
This is no time to shop!

1128
01:46:00,652 --> 01:46:03,952
Leslie, I've been hit. I got tanks on me.

1129
01:46:03,988 --> 01:46:08,278
You've got to get to the general's
office and shut down the main computer.

1130
01:46:08,326 --> 01:46:12,786
How am I going to do that? The guards
are all over the entrance to his office!

1131
01:46:25,969 --> 01:46:28,639
<i>Please watch your step.</i>

1132
01:46:48,408 --> 01:46:53,958
-Alsatia! We're running out of toys!
-That's not good.

1133
01:47:01,254 --> 01:47:02,554
Leslie.

1134
01:47:25,737 --> 01:47:28,617
Sir. Over there.

1135
01:47:32,410 --> 01:47:34,410
These designs are good!

1136
01:47:36,581 --> 01:47:39,711
Leslie, watch out! Bandit at 9 o'clock!

1137
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:50,390
Shoo! Get out of here!
No! No!

1138
01:47:50,428 --> 01:47:52,558
Go, go! Get out of here!

1139
01:47:52,597 --> 01:47:53,807
Take him down!

1140
01:47:55,433 --> 01:48:00,733
Go away! Get away!
Go away, Swiss army bastard. I mean it.

1141
01:48:22,252 --> 01:48:24,462
Give up?

1142
01:48:25,922 --> 01:48:28,262
-And you thought I was a fool.
-I'm gonna kill you!

1143
01:48:46,985 --> 01:48:51,605
I will not let you destroy...

1144
01:48:51,656 --> 01:48:54,116
...dad's dream!

1145
01:50:23,039 --> 01:50:26,499
<i>Power failure.
Main power failure.</i>

1146
01:50:26,543 --> 01:50:28,553
<i>Main power failure.</i>

1147
01:50:28,586 --> 01:50:31,716
<i>Main power fail--</i>

1148
01:50:34,175 --> 01:50:38,255
<i>alternate power online now.</i>

1149
01:50:41,516 --> 01:50:44,556
You tried to kill us all.

1150
01:50:45,186 --> 01:50:47,516
Come on, Leslie.
Can't you take a joke?

1151
01:50:47,564 --> 01:50:53,194
Oh, yeah. I can. I love jokes.
I love all kinds of jokes.

1152
01:50:53,236 --> 01:50:55,236
But you know what
i don't think is funny...

1153
01:50:55,447 --> 01:50:57,777
...is when somebody
tries to kill me, my family...

1154
01:50:57,824 --> 01:51:00,544
...and destroy the world as I know it.
That just doesn't sit well.

1155
01:51:00,577 --> 01:51:02,787
I don't know why. Call me crazy.

1156
01:51:15,759 --> 01:51:19,639
-I came real close to being just like you.
-Oh, come on, boys.

1157
01:51:19,679 --> 01:51:22,519
Can't we all sit down together
and talk this thing out amiably?

1158
01:51:25,310 --> 01:51:28,860
Leslie, Leslie! Isn't it wonderful?
It's over!

1159
01:51:28,897 --> 01:51:31,067
And the best part is, no one got hurt!

1160
01:51:39,240 --> 01:51:40,580
What a ride!

1161
01:51:42,702 --> 01:51:47,082
Oh, no. He broke my sister.

1162
01:51:49,376 --> 01:51:52,416
Oh, I think I'd like a sandwich now.

1163
01:51:52,462 --> 01:51:55,802
-Alsatia's a robot?
-Yeah. My dad built her for me.

1164
01:51:55,840 --> 01:51:58,180
My mom died so early,
he thought I needed somebody.

1165
01:51:58,551 --> 01:52:00,551
I always thought
she seemed the same age.

1166
01:52:01,554 --> 01:52:05,984
I'd like to have some soup now.

1167
01:52:06,017 --> 01:52:08,977
-Can you put her back together again?
-Oh, yes.

1168
01:52:09,020 --> 01:52:11,190
Her plans are in your father's safe.

1169
01:52:12,315 --> 01:52:16,145
-Everything's gonna be all right, al.
-Do you love--? Do you love me?

1170
01:52:16,194 --> 01:52:21,374
Of course I do, al. I'd give you a big
hug, but your body's over there.

1171
01:52:22,325 --> 01:52:25,155
I miss my heart.

1172
01:52:25,203 --> 01:52:27,913
We'll get you back together real soon.

1173
01:52:36,965 --> 01:52:40,425
Don't-- oh, no.

1174
01:52:40,468 --> 01:52:43,758
-Al, you're gonna be all right.
-Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be fine.

1175
01:52:43,805 --> 01:52:47,475
I'm fine. I'm fine.
I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.

1176
01:52:47,517 --> 01:52:50,807
Hey, look, al. It's Christmas.

1177
01:52:50,854 --> 01:52:53,364
No. Oh, don't, please. No, you can't.

1178
01:52:57,861 --> 01:53:01,361
<i>Klaatu bravada nikto</i>!

1179
01:54:00,757 --> 01:54:04,387
<i>He's breaking away from the defense.
He's running for the 20, the 10....</i>

1180
01:54:04,427 --> 01:54:09,017
<i>Holy smokes, it's a touchdown,
ladies and gentlemen. Touchdown!</i>

1181
01:55:18,251 --> 01:55:20,341
Howdy.

1182
01:55:24,758 --> 01:55:26,888
-Hi.
-You look stunning.

1183
01:55:26,926 --> 01:55:29,466
Oh, stop.

1184
01:55:40,440 --> 01:55:43,190
-So this is Paris.
-What?

1185
01:55:43,860 --> 01:55:46,360
She still needs a little work.

1186
01:55:46,404 --> 01:55:50,454
-Can you carry me?
-I think it's better if you walk.

1187
01:55:53,703 --> 01:55:55,713
Here, let me help you.

1188
01:55:57,374 --> 01:55:58,384
Dad...

1189
01:56:00,251 --> 01:56:03,091
...don't worry.
Zevo toys is in good hands.

1190
01:56:03,129 --> 01:56:05,549
Well, I gotta go now.
My country calls.

1191
01:56:05,590 --> 01:56:08,510
-Well, you'll be back for easter?
-Of course.

1192
01:56:08,551 --> 01:56:11,601
We'll be having eggs.

1193
01:56:13,765 --> 01:56:15,765
Take care.

1194
01:56:16,393 --> 01:56:19,483
You don't know your own strength.
Keep it.

1195
01:56:19,688 --> 01:56:22,018
I can always use a good hand.

1196
01:56:22,065 --> 01:56:24,565
See you later. Peace.

1197
01:56:25,276 --> 01:56:29,856
He's funny, sporty and mysterious.

1198
01:56:38,748 --> 01:56:40,828
Patrick?

1199
01:56:41,459 --> 01:56:43,459
Yeah?

1200
01:56:43,920 --> 01:56:45,960
Just checking.
