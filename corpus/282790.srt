"BOILING POINT"

4
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:50,200
Playing in
such a dusty place...

5
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,040
They're stupid.

6
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,550
Watching makes us worse.

7
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,320
Shut up! Damn you!

8
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:05,060
Did you come to take
a crap or play ball?

9
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,660
Why stay in the can so long?

10
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:11,690
Good!

11
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,640
Can't you guys
get any points?

12
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:22,740
So far, nothing.

13
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,150
Watch it! Get a hit!

14
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,850
At least get one point.

15
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:50,710
Too bad!

16
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,140
We'll try harder.

17
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:55,640
Next batter?

18
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,370
Akira, you're next!

19
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,210
Akira!

20
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:05,720
I need a coach.

21
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:07,720
Someone, go!

22
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,730
Go coach him.

23
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,960
Somebody who knows
more about baseball.

24
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,670
What are you saying? Ass!

25
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,830
Just standing is enough.

26
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:21,730
You go.

27
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,990
Watch the ball!

28
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:25,090
Give a sign.
Turn your hand or something.

29
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,310
Don't just watch.

30
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,790
Here we go!

31
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,460
What are you doing?

32
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,750
You're coaching
the other team.

33
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,460
Quit! Just pick up balls!

34
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:55,530
Pitcher! Look what
you've done!

35
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,520
You hit him on purpose!

36
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,460
What if something
happens to him?

37
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,190
Don't get so upset.

38
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,960
Shut up! Apologize!

39
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:06,640
That's enough.

40
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,140
I'm sorry.

41
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:11,400
I'm telling him off
for your sake.

42
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,040
It's your fault!

43
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,230
This is the last inning.

44
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,200
Get at least one point.

45
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,770
Hopeless kids!

46
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,230
Don't sit on my glove.

47
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:50,340
Hey, you! Pinch-hit!

48
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,710
He won't make it.

49
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,210
Two out already.

50
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,750
Umpire, a pinch-hitter!

51
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:00,890
Go!

52
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:11,360
I'm giving you a chance.
Hit one!

53
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,530
Too high! It's a strike?

54
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:22,810
Hit the next one!
Take a chance!

55
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:31,450
Never mind.
Pick a better ball.

56
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:50,110
Charment wins 5-0.
Take a bow!

57
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:59,840
You should've swung
your bat at least once.

58
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:06,860
Why be seated?

59
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:08,290
It's over.

60
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,820
We've ten minutes left.
Play catch or something.

61
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:14,620
Go away!

62
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:43,730
Swing your bat 100 times
a day. You'll improve.

63
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,800
Come on, let's go!

64
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:04,540
Sorry for a while ago.

65
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:08,320
I get excited so easily.

66
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,610
You're late. What kept you?

67
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,210
I have a date. See?

68
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:39,240
Change clothes fast
and wash that Mercedes.

69
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,220
Wait a sec. I'll change.

70
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:07,230
I went to his place,
but he's missing.

71
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:08,740
Sure.

72
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:12,310
Nobody knows where he is.

73
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,720
Maybe he ran.

74
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:22,960
I'm at a gas station.
I'll be back in half an hour.

75
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,090
Sure. I'll be back soon.

76
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:36,970
My car... through already?

77
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,670
Speak up!

78
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:50,820
You haven't done
one damn thing!

79
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:57,590
The wheels are still dirty!

80
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:21,850
The ashtray...

81
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,520
I'm going. Is the tank full?

82
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,620
I don't know.

83
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:38,970
Not yet?

84
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,370
Hey!

85
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:50,140
Don't make light of me!

86
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:01,760
I'm sorry.

87
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:09,560
He hasn't done a thing.
What's going on?

88
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,000
Isn't this your job?

89
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,010
I'm sorry.

90
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,110
Dammit, do your
work properly!

91
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:31,860
I'm very sorry.

92
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:38,630
You do it right, or
I'll make you go broke!

93
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,790
What do you want?

94
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,240
No!

95
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,270
You goddam punk!

96
00:12:55,610 --> 00:13:00,140
It hurts! Maybe
my arm's broken.

97
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,940
I'll go see a doc.

98
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,230
How was it?

99
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:23,240
The doctor said
his arm is all right.

100
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:29,610
But his boss will come to
settle it. What'll we do?

101
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,200
Yes?

102
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:01,510
I took today off.

103
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,610
I have to deliver this.
Want to come?

104
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,850
Follow me.

105
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,310
You all right?

106
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:44,820
It's fast. Be careful.

107
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,630
He has no license.

108
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,100
Which is better?

109
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:02,300
This one.

110
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,570
I don't want it.

111
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:09,770
He doesn't want it!

112
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:28,800
I want time off.

113
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:34,300
Hey, don't you have a date?

114
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:38,710
No.

115
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,470
Why not pick up a chick?

116
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,880
It won't work.

117
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,010
Try and see.

118
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:56,990
I'll leave.

119
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:02,730
This is for you.

120
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:06,170
Try, okay?

121
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,660
What time do you finish?

122
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:37,530
We close at 11.

123
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,290
Got a motorcycle?

124
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,430
Want to come?

125
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,130
Where are you going?

126
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,870
Where are you going?

127
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:40,990
You listening?
Don't glare at us.

128
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:45,690
This road's wide enough.
Be more careful!

129
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,030
We're gangsters.
We can't go to the cops.

130
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,330
Just do what you can.

131
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:31,100
We'll pay his medical fee.

132
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:36,910
We're gangsters, but
I'm not here to threaten you.

133
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:44,450
We don't want to cause
a fuss in the neighborhood.

134
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,410
Just do what you can.

135
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,550
Thank you.

136
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:57,070
We'll pay the medical fee.

137
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:03,640
We're gangsters. Don't you
know what we're here for?

138
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,550
You did it?

139
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,290
Why not join us?

140
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,900
A gangster came.
He from the Otomo Group?

141
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,510
You hit his man, right?

142
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,170
He hit me first.

143
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:44,270
You shouldn't have
fought back.

144
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,510
So, he came
to bulldoze you.

145
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,490
What'll you do?

146
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:53,580
I'll go to their office.

147
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,830
You will? What for?

148
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,960
We'll talk and settle it.

149
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,870
No, you can't.

150
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:09,530
You were with Otomo, right?

151
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,600
Welcome!

152
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:15,510
Go with him.

153
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:23,310
What a sty!

154
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,820
Anyway we can drink.

155
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:32,390
Want a highball?

156
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,660
Can't make one?

157
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,070
Pork cutlet on rice.

158
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,510
Make it highballs.

159
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,910
Got a john?

160
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:51,910
Over there.

161
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,350
I bet it's dirty.

162
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:56,320
Probably so.

163
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,690
Got an ashtray?

164
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,390
Shall I sing?

165
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:11,830
What's wrong?

166
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:16,370
It was filthy!
It absolutely reeks!

167
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:22,950
Piss outside then!

168
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,890
Get out!

169
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,200
How's business?

170
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:47,740
Today's customers are lousy.

171
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:53,880
They borrow but
don't pay back.

172
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:57,040
The world's nuts.

173
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:37,410
Hi, Mr. Iguchi!

174
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:42,090
Muto, how have you been?

175
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:51,300
I talked with Otomo.

176
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,470
About that gas station...

177
00:23:56,540 --> 00:24:00,340
Whatever happened,
will you overlook it?

178
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,010
My man's arm was broken.

179
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:07,020
We can't ignore it.

180
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,450
Do as I say!

181
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,820
Mr. Iguchi, didn't you
quit being a gangster?

182
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:20,050
You're no longer my boss.

183
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,360
Mr. Iguchi, huh?

184
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,560
From now on I'll
just call you Iguchi.

185
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,010
Got it, Iguchi?

186
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,880
What's all this, Otomo?

187
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:47,090
Don't "Otomo" me!

188
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:51,490
This is how we work to live.

189
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:55,320
Spoiled guy!

190
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,060
Bring money first.

191
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:02,200
That's what we want.

192
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,150
Sorry for a while ago.

193
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:49,450
Can we talk?

194
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,450
All right.

195
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,780
Go first.

196
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,230
I said, leave.

197
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:34,090
Stop it, Mr. Iguchi!

198
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:38,360
You said you'd
call me Iguchi.

199
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:43,100
Mr. Iguchi.

200
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,440
Iguchi, right?

201
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,140
Mr. Iguchi.

202
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,150
Just Iguchi.

203
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:55,850
Mr. Iguchi.

204
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,880
Say, "Iguchi".

205
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:02,860
Mr. Iguchi.

206
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,560
"Iguchi".

207
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:09,720
Mr... Iguchi...

208
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,900
No. "Iguchi".

209
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:17,910
Iguchi...

210
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:21,680
That's it, Mr. Muto.

211
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:07,320
What? I touched him!

212
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:10,490
How can you call it "safe"?

213
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:13,290
Damn umpire! Ass!

214
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,130
Open your eyes!

215
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,990
He tagged the runner.

216
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:18,970
He tagged him here.

217
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,760
Like hell he did!

218
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:21,600
I saw it.

219
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,170
Know baseball?

220
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:27,040
He was safe. Safe! Got it?

221
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:28,510
Idiot umpire!

222
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:32,640
Never mind.
Quit! I'll make up for it.

223
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,840
That's why you never win!

224
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:37,380
Forget that ass. Let's start.

225
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:39,820
"That ass"? Damn you!

226
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,230
Hey, wait!

227
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:59,400
Go! Go!

228
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:33,770
About the dress
we saw the other day...

229
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,180
Lay off! I told you
I'm broke.

230
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,060
Want to swing
that bat forever?

231
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,400
I'll pinch-hit.

232
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,480
All you ever do
is strike out!

233
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,570
I'll get a hit.

234
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,120
Change! Reverse the score!

235
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:20,650
The last inning.

236
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,480
Get two points.

237
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,830
Get at least two.

238
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,990
Don't bat a foul.

239
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:04,460
Ass!

240
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,510
Get a man on base!

241
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,810
Watch out!

242
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:27,650
Sorry.

243
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:36,800
Pick a good ball!

244
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,080
Last inning, two out.

245
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,150
Take a chance!

246
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:03,190
Wait for a good ball!

247
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,520
Our chance!

248
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:20,330
It's our chance.
Get at least one point.

249
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:26,280
Next batter...?

250
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:27,950
Kobayashi.

251
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,850
Him? What's he doing?

252
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,760
He's in the can.

253
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:37,130
The can? What a dunce!

254
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,690
Where's the next batter?

255
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,360
In the can.

256
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:46,800
Get a pinch-hitter for him.

257
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:49,140
Pinch-hitter? Who?

258
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,610
I'll do it.

259
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:02,810
Yeah! You.
Swat the first ball.

260
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,310
Let 'em have it!

261
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:08,650
Swing, okay?

262
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,310
He did it!

263
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:53,050
Out? What for?

264
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,260
Because you passed him.

265
00:34:57,070 --> 00:35:01,330
Why did you? We could've
reversed the score.

266
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:03,830
Game over.

267
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,410
It could've been a homerun.

268
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:12,540
You did a good job.

269
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:16,890
But you should
never pass a runner.

270
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,020
You were slow.

271
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:23,090
What? I ran fast.

272
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,250
Just run properly. Ass!

273
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:30,570
He passed me!

274
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:55,650
Have the gangsters come
again to your gas station?

275
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:58,590
They won't.

276
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,660
You're faster
than I thought.

277
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:07,000
You already laid her?

278
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:12,070
Aren't you marrying Miki?

279
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,580
What for?
I've got plenty of chicks.

280
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:20,820
What about you?

281
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:24,680
I'll marry her.

282
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:27,850
Nonsense!

283
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:34,420
Your woman came. She's at
the tennis court over there.

284
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:45,100
You're too fast!

285
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:48,100
You're too slow!

286
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:52,540
How silly!

287
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,330
Don't pass me!

288
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,590
Ass!

289
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:55,210
Dammit, who do you think
you called an ass?!

290
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:44,760
You dating?

291
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:50,760
Got laid already?

292
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:57,330
Where to?

293
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,300
An aquarium.

294
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:04,410
To see a panda? How nice!

295
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:09,140
But fishing is even nicer.
Come with me.

296
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:37,880
Sayaka.

297
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,780
Want to know my name?

298
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:45,980
It's James.

299
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:59,060
No catch. Shall we
go to the aquarium?

300
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:13,980
How is it?

301
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:15,820
I did it at last!

302
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:21,210
It's that pin.

303
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:22,200
The upper one?

304
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:26,110
It's bent.

305
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:29,470
They pull tricks on you.

306
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,310
I see.

307
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,490
Can't make it.

308
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:41,320
What's the big idea? Stop!

309
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:42,650
I need balls.

310
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:46,420
No. I've lost
10,000 yen already.

311
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:49,260
You're lying. Ass!

312
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:52,000
Enough! Stop!

313
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,620
He's sly.

314
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:10,780
From any point of view,
he's richer.

315
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,090
Why take my balls?

316
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:28,100
Yes?

317
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,110
Balls don't come out.

318
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:33,500
I'll destroy this shop.

319
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:36,370
I'll burn it.

320
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,450
Cigarettes.

321
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,780
That'll be 75 balls.

322
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,390
Thank you.

323
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:54,730
And you?

324
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:57,470
Gum.

325
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:58,830
Don't have gum.

326
00:41:59,040 --> 00:41:59,700
None?

327
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:01,000
Sorry.

328
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:08,510
Hi, players!
Thanks for your patronage.

329
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:11,510
I have news for you.

330
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:16,680
You can't win in this dump.

331
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,820
Let's go to another place.

332
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:25,390
It's called "New Prince",
it's near here.

333
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:29,730
They're offering
a special discount today.

334
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:35,400
I repeat, you'll never win
staying in this dump.

335
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:37,740
Switch to another place.

336
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:46,080
Never come again!

337
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:47,250
Shut up!

338
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:51,520
I'll make you go bankrupt!

339
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,350
Go first.

340
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:09,660
Hey, Iguchi,
come with us, okay?

341
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:11,740
Say something?

342
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:14,540
Come with us.

343
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,310
Before that.

344
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:20,710
Iguchi.

345
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:22,580
Where's Otomo?

346
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:24,710
He'll come later.

347
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:28,360
Making me wait?

348
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:32,020
Shut up, damn you!

349
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:36,030
You're tough, huh?

350
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:01,730
Why not straighten out?

351
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,390
Quit acting like a gangster.

352
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:12,700
See a doc?

353
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:15,470
He doesn't want to.

354
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:20,770
He's going to Okinawa
to get a gun.

355
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:22,440
But he can't move.

356
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,610
He says so.

357
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:26,590
Stupid!

358
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,720
I'll go to Okinawa.

359
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:35,930
I'll buy a gun.

360
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:39,620
Anybody want to
come with me?

361
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:04,490
What's on your mind?
Going to Okinawa?

362
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:08,780
Keep away from gangsters.

363
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:11,860
Cancel it.

364
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,940
Here. Take it with you.

365
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:13,090
Got tissue? Tissue!

366
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:15,360
No.

367
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:33,540
Wonder how
Iguchi's doing...

368
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:41,340
Shall we go to town
this evening?

369
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:18,610
How much have you embezzled?

370
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,490
A big amount, huh?

371
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:30,600
Bring the money and one of
your fingers by tomorrow.

372
00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:37,340
Remember, we're taking
care of you.

373
00:47:39,310 --> 00:47:41,680
Aren't you ashamed
of yourself?

374
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:43,580
Bastard!

375
00:47:47,150 --> 00:47:50,590
What are you going to do
with that bottle?

376
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:54,790
Go ahead!

377
00:48:32,830 --> 00:48:34,130
Stop!

378
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:38,070
Brother!

379
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:41,370
I said to stop!

380
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:44,310
Brother!

381
00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:12,030
US Army surplus stuff?

382
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:14,230
No.

383
00:49:15,310 --> 00:49:16,400
Secondhand?

384
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:19,770
I made it look old.

385
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:23,410
It's good.

386
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:29,850
Come here often?

387
00:49:31,390 --> 00:49:32,360
No. Rarely.

388
00:49:35,630 --> 00:49:37,460
You shaved your legs?

389
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:43,430
Got a chick?

390
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:46,100
Laid her already?

391
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:56,070
You smell nice.

392
00:49:57,650 --> 00:50:00,910
Want a drink? Want to play?

393
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:09,590
Call a hostess?

394
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:29,630
Don't waste your money here.
Why not go to work?

395
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:43,180
Damn you!

396
00:52:55,690 --> 00:52:56,750
You all right?

397
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:10,940
You drank and sang too much.

398
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:21,520
Tamagi, cut off your finger.

399
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:23,280
Why me?

400
00:53:23,490 --> 00:53:24,920
We're buddies.

401
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:26,110
So what?

402
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:28,030
Do as I say.

403
00:53:28,190 --> 00:53:29,160
No.

404
00:53:29,330 --> 00:53:30,490
Come on.

405
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:35,160
The boss told me
to cut off my finger.

406
00:53:35,330 --> 00:53:36,360
Forget it.

407
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:39,970
Please help me.
I'm in a fix.

408
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:49,470
Why not drink?

409
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:54,010
What's the matter?

410
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:55,650
It's Tamagi.

411
00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:58,360
Knock it off and drink.

412
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:00,790
What?

413
00:54:01,090 --> 00:54:06,290
Come on, drink.
It's good. Guzzle it.

414
00:54:06,430 --> 00:54:07,900
You're great, huh?

415
00:54:08,270 --> 00:54:09,130
Why?

416
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,160
You ask why?

417
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:20,570
Damn you!

418
00:54:22,350 --> 00:54:23,250
Ass!

419
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:33,050
Drink!

420
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:36,760
Drink!

421
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:31,070
Tamagi, you got a chick?

422
00:55:32,350 --> 00:55:33,370
No.

423
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:36,140
How do you do it, then?

424
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:38,710
I manage.

425
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:43,250
I'll get you Fumiyo.

426
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:47,720
Fumiyo, sleep with Tamagi.

427
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:49,070
No.

428
00:55:49,270 --> 00:55:50,260
Don't bother.

429
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:53,230
Do it. I'm asking you.

430
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:55,060
I don't want to.

431
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:56,470
Stop it!

432
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:59,840
Do as I say!
Sleep with him! Ass!

433
00:56:00,810 --> 00:56:01,680
Do it!

434
00:56:48,690 --> 00:56:50,160
Let me do it.

435
00:56:54,770 --> 00:56:56,130
Hey, brother!

436
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,830
What's on your mind?

437
00:57:00,170 --> 00:57:01,800
Lots of things.

438
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:05,840
Hey, that hurts!

439
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:06,840
Be quiet!

440
00:57:07,510 --> 00:57:09,340
No! Stop!

441
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:14,210
Your finger.

442
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:15,920
Why must I cut it?

443
00:57:17,290 --> 00:57:18,720
You laid my woman.

444
00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:21,750
You told me to.

445
00:57:23,090 --> 00:57:25,320
But you shouldn't have!

446
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:27,250
Cut it off!

447
00:57:28,470 --> 00:57:29,260
All right!

448
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,770
What are you doing?

449
00:57:39,110 --> 00:57:39,870
Shut up!

450
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:40,670
Ouch!

451
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:41,750
Hold him down!

452
00:57:41,910 --> 00:57:42,500
That hurts!

453
00:57:42,650 --> 00:57:43,880
Hold him down!

454
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:48,080
Or I'll cut your fingers!

455
00:57:55,630 --> 00:57:57,220
Anything to hit it?

456
00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:00,730
Bring something to hit it.

457
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:02,080
Let me bat.

458
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:08,620
Here I go!

459
01:00:59,010 --> 01:01:03,450
I'm tired of this.
Let me bat this time, too!

460
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:09,390
Pitch it right!

461
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:13,450
Come!

462
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:48,090
Why so mad?

463
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:52,890
You slept with Tamagi.

464
01:01:53,060 --> 01:01:54,830
You told me to.

465
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:57,670
But you shouldn't have!

466
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:59,030
What are you saying?

467
01:02:02,810 --> 01:02:03,740
Bitch!

468
01:02:16,250 --> 01:02:17,280
Why cry?

469
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:25,220
Dive, okay?

470
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:27,190
Let's dive together.

471
01:02:39,940 --> 01:02:42,110
Brother, let's go.

472
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:47,710
Quit crying!

473
01:03:05,270 --> 01:03:06,790
Why so many here?

474
01:03:08,310 --> 01:03:10,100
You told us to get in.

475
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:11,940
Shut up!

476
01:03:13,850 --> 01:03:15,310
It's so hot!

477
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:20,450
How noisy!

478
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:26,990
Someone get out.

479
01:03:30,030 --> 01:03:31,460
How noisy!

480
01:03:48,580 --> 01:03:49,310
Ass!

481
01:03:50,150 --> 01:03:51,710
Why force her?

482
01:03:53,180 --> 01:03:53,980
Shut up!

483
01:04:55,050 --> 01:04:56,380
He wants 3 million.

484
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:58,270
3 million?

485
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:01,680
3 million, huh?

486
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:04,880
Come down to 2.5.

487
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:07,550
Okay.

488
01:05:07,890 --> 01:05:11,850
I'll ask my pal.
Give me a margin, huh?

489
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:13,960
Then 2.5 million.

490
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:15,400
Later.

491
01:06:55,270 --> 01:06:56,160
Where's mine?

492
01:06:56,330 --> 01:06:57,390
None for you.

493
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:01,540
Don't gripe.

494
01:08:25,620 --> 01:08:28,560
Take the leftovers.
Go home tomorrow?

495
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:32,090
'Bye.

496
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:11,290
Finished?

497
01:11:12,620 --> 01:11:13,490
Let's go.

498
01:11:15,260 --> 01:11:16,390
Get out!

499
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:20,050
Take me to town.

500
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:21,490
Like hell!

501
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:14,240
Where's the money?

502
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:55,080
Think this is enough?

503
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:06,190
Whose finger is this?

504
01:14:10,870 --> 01:14:13,100
That's why we call you scum.

505
01:17:22,260 --> 01:17:23,950
Here you are.

506
01:17:28,870 --> 01:17:30,060
Thank you.

507
01:18:08,740 --> 01:18:13,110
Flight No. 66 for Tokyo
is now boarding.

508
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:14,430
Leaving?

509
01:18:16,050 --> 01:18:17,340
From my brother.

510
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:23,180
Sorry for everything.
Take care, huh?

511
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:26,590
See you again in Tokyo.

512
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:20,170
BUTTERFLY EGGS

513
01:20:45,260 --> 01:20:47,890
Want some sweets? Have one.

514
01:20:49,870 --> 01:20:50,700
Eat.

515
01:20:55,240 --> 01:20:56,170
Good!

516
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:02,100
And this.

517
01:21:03,150 --> 01:21:05,580
Butterfly eggs for you.

518
01:21:07,750 --> 01:21:08,680
Open it.

519
01:21:09,950 --> 01:21:10,680
Later.

520
01:21:10,890 --> 01:21:12,350
Open it now.

521
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:14,590
Make it later.

522
01:21:37,650 --> 01:21:38,710
Wait a minute.

523
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:41,780
Is this yours?

524
01:21:44,860 --> 01:21:46,050
What's with you?

525
01:21:46,590 --> 01:21:48,150
No, it's not mine.

526
01:21:48,330 --> 01:21:49,420
Look at this.

527
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:52,090
It's not mine!

528
01:21:52,260 --> 01:21:53,320
Call the police!

529
01:21:54,970 --> 01:21:56,990
Know what this means?

530
01:22:20,190 --> 01:22:21,350
The gun.

531
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:30,820
You shoot.

532
01:22:35,310 --> 01:22:36,430
For your uncle.

533
01:22:36,970 --> 01:22:37,770
Sure?

534
01:22:37,910 --> 01:22:39,140
Sure.

535
01:22:40,310 --> 01:22:41,440
For Kobayashi.

536
01:22:45,820 --> 01:22:46,780
Let's go.

01:23:35,930 --> 01:23:37,020
Let go!

539
01:24:48,810 --> 01:24:50,270
He's in his room.

540
01:24:50,870 --> 01:24:53,310
He was badly beaten.

541
01:24:58,980 --> 01:25:01,680
You fighting with gangsters?

542
01:27:34,940 --> 01:27:36,270
Give me these.

543
01:29:05,130 --> 01:29:07,930
Where have you been
all this time?

544
01:29:08,870 --> 01:29:12,230
You know what you're doing?
Troublemaker!

545
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:18,560
What about Iguchi?

546
01:29:21,710 --> 01:29:26,380
We're short of hands.
Work again from tomorrow.

547
01:29:26,780 --> 01:29:28,270
Or I can't do a thing!

548
01:29:31,250 --> 01:29:35,420
