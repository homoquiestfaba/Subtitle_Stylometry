00:00:24,415 --> 00:00:29,919
LEPRECHAUN 4
In Space

2
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:34,093
Hey, Lucky,
got a cigarette?

3
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:37,095
No, Mooch,
I don't have any cigarettes.

4
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,533
Why don't you ask me
for a breath mint sometime?

5
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,602
What's that supposed to mean?
Hey!

6
00:01:43,871 --> 00:01:44,872
Hey, Sticks,
give me a cigarette.

7
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:49,209
Cool.
Could I have one for later?

8
00:01:50,878 --> 00:01:52,978
All right, cool.
Can I have a match?

9
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:56,416
Mooch, leave me alone.
Get yourself adopted or something.

10
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:57,349
Shit.

11
00:01:57,384 --> 00:01:59,453
Delores, give me a couple
of eggs over easy.

12
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,789
Thank you baby.
Yeah.

13
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:03,991
Who's hungry?

14
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:06,460
Martinez...

15
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,197
Whoa, Martinez,
baby, baby!

16
00:02:10,264 --> 00:02:12,266
- Wake up.
- Yes, sir.

17
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:16,203
Drop one of them, you'll end up
looking like Swiss cheese.

18
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,671
Give me a break.
You never dropped anything?

19
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,342
Atten... hut!

20
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:28,148
All right.
Listen up.

21
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:30,851
We are orbiting the planet
of Ithacon.

22
00:02:30,918 --> 00:02:33,453
In a few minutes,
we will board the shuttlecraft

23
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,923
and proceed to
target area Delta.

24
00:02:36,056 --> 00:02:40,527
Our mission is search
and destroy.

25
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:44,932
I repeat,
search and destroy.

26
00:02:45,065 --> 00:02:47,734
We've been chasing this alien
son of a bitch long enough.

27
00:02:47,868 --> 00:02:49,870
In the past six months,
he has disrupted

28
00:02:49,937 --> 00:02:54,608
the galactic mining operation to
the tune of a half billion dollars.

29
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:57,211
Word's come down from above.

30
00:02:57,411 --> 00:02:59,978
Kill the bastard!

31
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,749
Now, what is our motto?

32
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:05,519
Semper fi. Do or die.
Kill, kill, kill.

33
00:03:05,586 --> 00:03:06,987
I can't hear you!

34
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,790
Semper fi. Do or die.
Kill, kill, kill.

35
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:11,925
Good, good!

36
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:13,727
What the hell are you
doing here, lady?

37
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:16,129
You're in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

38
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,931
This is for
authorized personnel only.

39
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,602
I'm looking for
Sergeant Hooker.

40
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:24,137
You found him. I'm busy.
What the fuck do you want?

41
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:28,275
- I'm Dr. Reeves.
- Great! Dr. Reeves is here.

42
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:34,414
- I've been assigned to your group.
- What the hell for?

43
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:38,385
I'm to collect samples
of any alien life forms

44
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,254
and report them back
to Dr. Mittenhand.

45
00:03:40,454 --> 00:03:43,257
Bullshit!
Bullshit!

46
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,058
- Sticks!
- Sir! Yes, sir!

47
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:46,593
Give me Dr. Mittenhand, now!

48
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,027
- At ease!
- Computer...

49
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,665
Get your lazy butt online.
We need to speak to the boss.

50
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:53,232
What is it?

51
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:55,602
Sergeant Hooker here, sir,
in the Armory.

52
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:57,471
We got a female
of the species,

53
00:03:57,671 --> 00:04:00,607
says she's assigned to
our search and destroy mission.

54
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:02,107
Correct.

55
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:05,479
Dr. Reeves is the ship's
biological officer

56
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:07,646
and my personal assistant.

57
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:11,652
You will see to it that she
is protected at all times.

58
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:14,254
With all due respect sir,
we can't be babysitting...

59
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:16,857
You have your orders, Sergeant.

60
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:20,661
I suggest you follow them.

61
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:28,535
- Books!
- Sir! Yes, sir!

62
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:33,140
Get this little girl...
ready for combat.

63
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,010
From now on,
she's your responsibility.

64
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:39,413
Sir! Yes, sir!

65
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:41,415
Let's mount up!

66
00:04:58,932 --> 00:05:00,899
Is this really necessary?

67
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:03,136
If you want to stay alive,
it is.

68
00:05:03,337 --> 00:05:04,605
Do you mind?

69
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:07,407
Excuse me, excuse me.
Gentle, gentle.

70
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,142
The problem my friend
is having,

71
00:05:09,343 --> 00:05:11,411
he's never had to put clothes
on a woman before.

72
00:05:11,612 --> 00:05:13,080
As you were, Sticks.

73
00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:17,050
Ughh! Having fun?

74
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:21,788
Damn! Who's driving?
Ray Charles?

75
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:22,990
Sorry.

76
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:24,458
You all right?

77
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:27,661
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.

78
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:31,665
Uh, better strap yourself in.

79
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:59,326
Good evening.

80
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:05,866
An angel's voice sends pleasure
to every part of my being.

81
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:11,471
Your shrieks, my dear,
provide a perfect accompaniment

82
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,140
to this romantic evening.

83
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:18,278
Dinner for two.

84
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,921
Don't be afraid, me dear.
I'm love's own messenger

85
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:30,390
sent to bring you
tidings of joy

86
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:33,327
and the promise
of newborn ecstasy.

87
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,928
Take a seat.

88
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:41,602
A little of the bubbly to put us
on more friendly terms.

89
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,780
Listen up.

90
00:06:54,815 --> 00:06:56,216
We're going in.

91
00:06:56,984 --> 00:06:58,652
Bow heads!

92
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:03,457
Lord, be with us as we hunt down
this ungodly son of a bitch.

93
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:07,594
And give us the strength to kill
anything in our path

94
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:10,998
and may all our wounds
be flesh wounds only.

95
00:07:11,033 --> 00:07:13,066
Amen.

96
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:16,069
I feel real safe now.
Don't you?

97
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:20,674
Can I ask you something?

98
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:22,676
What happened to
the sergeant's head?

99
00:07:24,211 --> 00:07:26,213
Happened in the last war.

100
00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:28,882
The sergeant went down
in a shuttle over Crilanium.

101
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,651
Took out half his skull.

102
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:32,484
He still managed to carry
a wounded Marine

103
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:36,123
on his back 15 miles
before he reached our lines.

104
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:38,325
Wow...

105
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:41,328
Did he live?

106
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,330
The guy he carried
on his back?

107
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:49,670
Oh, yeah, he lived.

108
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:51,071
If you call this living.
Ooh!

109
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,743
To the most beautiful woman
in the universe,

110
00:07:56,944 --> 00:08:00,480
Princess Zarina,
my future wife.

111
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:03,317
Your wife?
Your wife!

112
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:06,787
How dare you?
Do you know who I am?

113
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,989
I am the daughter of a king.

114
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:10,924
And you will one day
be a queen.

115
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:15,329
And it is your royal blood, madame,
that will make me a king.

116
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:18,131
What? You, a king?

117
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,136
Laugh if you like, me darling,
but I'll have me way.

118
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:25,005
I'm a man amongst men,

119
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:28,141
and it's tired I am
of being treated like a dog.

120
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:30,611
From now on, the rest
of this miserable universe

121
00:08:30,811 --> 00:08:33,013
will bow and scrape
before me.

122
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:34,214
And if they don't...

123
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,451
off with their heads!
Ha, ha, ha!

124
00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:53,066
A real vacation spot.

125
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,669
I've seen worse.
Ever been to Detroit?

126
00:09:00,274 --> 00:09:03,010
Have you ever been
in combat before?

127
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:05,212
Yeah, lots of times.

128
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:07,481
Aren't you ever frightened?

129
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:10,083
Are you kidding?
I'm scared now.

130
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:14,454
So is everybody else.
It comes with the job.

131
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:18,926
Hey...

132
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:21,261
We fight better
when we're a bit goosed.

133
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:22,729
Know what I mean?

134
00:09:22,863 --> 00:09:24,331
Yeah.
I think so.

135
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:28,135
I'll never marry you!
Never!

136
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:30,035
I'd rather die first.

137
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:34,474
Would you rather be dead,
or would you rather be rich?

138
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:35,542
Excuse me?

139
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:38,545
Your father, the king,
hasn't a penny to his name.

140
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,280
He's a stupid old fool

141
00:09:40,347 --> 00:09:42,749
who gave everything he had
to his loyal subjects

142
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:45,052
leaving his family with nothing.

143
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,487
He was being noble.

144
00:09:47,522 --> 00:09:49,723
He was being a fool.

145
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,726
I'll make you rich beyond
your wildest dreams.

146
00:09:54,528 --> 00:09:56,129
Oh, really?

147
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:57,998
Yes, really.

148
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,738
They're beautiful!

149
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:09,009
There's plenty more
where that came from.

150
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:11,812
You begin to interest me.
Vaguely.

151
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,585
Lucky, you're up.

152
00:10:20,654 --> 00:10:22,856
I'm getting a reading.
Check it out.

153
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:34,201
You were meant to be a queen,
and with me by your side

154
00:10:34,268 --> 00:10:37,204
you'll have the richest kingdom
in the universe.

155
00:10:37,271 --> 00:10:41,408
I'll cover you with jewels from
the far corners of the galaxy.

156
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:42,876
I deserve it, you know?

157
00:10:44,211 --> 00:10:46,013
For all I've suffered.

158
00:10:46,213 --> 00:10:48,282
Being a princess
and having nothing to wear...

159
00:10:50,184 --> 00:10:52,653
People treating me as though
I were common...

160
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:09,469
You'll have everything
you've ever wanted.

161
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:13,540
Gold is power.
Gold is power.

162
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,945
Power, power...

163
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:19,746
Power.

164
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,394
Aaahh!

165
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:36,997
Visitors.

166
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:39,800
My father!
He's found me.

167
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:41,935
If he has,
will you go with him?

168
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:46,807
The king is dead.
Long live the king.

169
00:11:47,808 --> 00:11:49,810
Oh, yes.

170
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:55,148
- Nice work, Lucky.
- Sorry, Sarge.

171
00:11:55,349 --> 00:11:57,718
Now the whole planet
knows we're here.

172
00:11:57,784 --> 00:11:59,552
Check out that passageway.

173
00:11:59,587 --> 00:12:01,321
The rest of you,
stay alert!

174
00:13:00,881 --> 00:13:02,282
Aaaahh!

175
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:07,521
Lucky! Go!
Move, move!

176
00:13:09,256 --> 00:13:11,258
No!
You stay with Cupcake.

177
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,526
Cupcake?

178
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:22,736
Stay here and don't move!

179
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:40,521
Sarge!

180
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:44,191
I'm gonna
take this bastard out!

181
00:13:47,794 --> 00:13:49,062
Get down!

182
00:13:59,873 --> 00:14:01,074
Let's move out!

183
00:14:03,277 --> 00:14:04,278
Let's do it!
Let's do it!

184
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:06,979
Go, go, go!

185
00:14:07,014 --> 00:14:09,216
- Nice toss, Kowalski.
- Grand slam.

186
00:14:10,584 --> 00:14:11,852
Good job, men.

187
00:14:14,254 --> 00:14:15,554
She's alive.

188
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:18,592
We need some help. We need to
get her to the shuttle.

189
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:19,660
Danny, get over here.

190
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:23,130
I'm doing my best,
but this doesn't look good.

191
00:14:24,932 --> 00:14:26,466
Books,
give us a hand here.

192
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:29,937
Here.

193
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,471
- Shit, man
- What are you doing?

194
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:34,274
I can reattach this.
Stop playing around.

195
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:40,280
Shit.

196
00:14:42,082 --> 00:14:43,283
Kowalski, Sticks!

197
00:14:45,652 --> 00:14:47,254
Start packing this up.

198
00:14:47,454 --> 00:14:49,122
Wait a minute, Sarge.
It was my kill.

199
00:14:49,256 --> 00:14:51,124
I get to add the final touch.

200
00:14:52,526 --> 00:14:54,928
Pure Rocky Mountain
spring water.

201
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:58,332
Death from above.

202
00:14:58,398 --> 00:14:59,800
Let it rain!

203
00:15:03,136 --> 00:15:05,405
Oh, shit!

204
00:15:05,606 --> 00:15:07,207
Way to go, KO.

205
00:15:07,341 --> 00:15:10,344
I'd give you a round of applause,
but I see you already got the clap.

206
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,812
That's not funny.

207
00:15:20,721 --> 00:15:22,789
This is Eagle One to base.

208
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:25,926
Mission accomplished.
Target has been destroyed.

209
00:15:25,993 --> 00:15:28,996
We got one killed and we're
bringing back a casualty.

210
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:33,200
Humanoid female.
Origin unknown.

211
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:35,869
Estimated time of arrival...
12 minutes.

212
00:15:52,853 --> 00:15:55,589
- Harold...
- I'm busy.

213
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:57,391
Harold, come look at this.

214
00:16:03,664 --> 00:16:04,932
What?

215
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:08,335
- You know what this is?
- Educate me.

216
00:16:08,535 --> 00:16:10,737
It's from the planet Dominia.

217
00:16:10,871 --> 00:16:13,473
It signifies royal birth.

218
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,075
This is quite
an opportunity.

219
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:17,945
For what?

220
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:21,081
If we can save her, it will mean
better relations with the Dominians.

221
00:16:22,483 --> 00:16:25,052
I want a complete work up
on her bodily fluids,

222
00:16:25,252 --> 00:16:29,323
organ delineation charts
and let's run an encephalogram.

223
00:16:29,456 --> 00:16:32,659
Run it through the main computer
so Dr. Mittenhand can look it over.

224
00:16:33,727 --> 00:16:34,928
Excuse me?

225
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,731
I don't work for you.

226
00:16:37,931 --> 00:16:41,134
Just do it. We'll fight about
who's in charge later.

227
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:43,136
You heard the lady, Harold.
Move your ass.

228
00:16:43,203 --> 00:16:44,137
Hey...

229
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:47,007
don't touch me unless
you mean it...

230
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:48,809
...cowboy.

231
00:16:53,614 --> 00:16:55,616
Don't ever do that again.

232
00:16:55,816 --> 00:16:57,117
Do what?
I was trying to help.

233
00:16:57,184 --> 00:16:59,586
I understand, but that's not
the help I need.

234
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,525
What was your name?

235
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:06,593
Sergeant Malloy.
Friends call me "Books. "

236
00:17:06,727 --> 00:17:09,596
Well, Sergeant Malloy,
I have a lot of work to do,

237
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:13,066
so if you don't mind, why don't
you return to your little unit

238
00:17:13,101 --> 00:17:16,403
and do whatever you people do
when you're not killing something?

239
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:19,072
Strip.

240
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:22,476
I beg your pardon.

241
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:25,679
I got to take your body armor.

242
00:17:32,186 --> 00:17:35,389
The entertainment lounge
is now open for refreshments.

243
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:36,990
Please drink in moderation

244
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:39,393
and have a wonderful evening.

245
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:41,261
Wow!
High grade material.

246
00:17:41,395 --> 00:17:42,996
The cave is riddled
with gold.

247
00:17:43,197 --> 00:17:44,598
Hurry up, dickhead!

248
00:17:44,665 --> 00:17:47,467
Get this secured
so that I can go get drunk.

249
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:08,121
Handy little gadget. What do you
do when you want to unload it?

250
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:18,131
Not bad.

251
00:18:18,332 --> 00:18:20,667
It was invented by
Dr. Mittenhand.

252
00:18:20,868 --> 00:18:22,402
He's a real genius.

253
00:18:22,536 --> 00:18:24,137
Yes, Harold.

254
00:18:24,338 --> 00:18:28,809
Thank you for that
heartfelt testimonial.

255
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:32,613
I have informed
Galactic Enterprises of our find.

256
00:18:32,813 --> 00:18:35,149
Our instructions are
to orbit the planet

257
00:18:35,349 --> 00:18:38,785
until a mining crew and
the appropriate equipment arrive.

258
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,787
Once the mining procedure
has begun

259
00:18:40,988 --> 00:18:42,589
we can return home.

260
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:45,058
Sergeant, your men
will act as security

261
00:18:45,093 --> 00:18:47,327
until we are relieved.
Any questions?

262
00:18:47,394 --> 00:18:49,196
Yeah, I got a question.

263
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:51,732
Our contracts expire
at midnight tonight.

264
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:55,736
I am sure a bonus of some kind
can be arranged.

265
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:57,436
We signed on for 30 days.

266
00:18:57,471 --> 00:19:01,008
Legally, we are free agents
as of midnight tonight.

267
00:19:01,074 --> 00:19:04,011
No one leaves this ship
unless I so say...

268
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:07,414
...say so.

269
00:19:09,016 --> 00:19:11,185
Is that clear, Sergeant?

270
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,653
Is that clear?

271
00:19:14,388 --> 00:19:15,656
With all due respect, sir...

272
00:19:15,856 --> 00:19:18,792
Thank you for understanding.

273
00:19:18,859 --> 00:19:20,394
Carry on.

274
00:19:22,396 --> 00:19:24,865
I wouldn't argue with
Dr. Mittenhand.

275
00:19:25,065 --> 00:19:26,266
Ever.

276
00:19:45,452 --> 00:19:46,720
Let's go someplace...

277
00:19:46,755 --> 00:19:48,455
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

278
00:19:48,655 --> 00:19:50,057
They're gonna see us leaving.

279
00:19:50,123 --> 00:19:52,125
They're not gonna know.
They're all drunk.

280
00:19:54,127 --> 00:19:55,929
- You think so?
- Yeah.

281
00:19:56,129 --> 00:19:57,130
Okay.

282
00:20:00,534 --> 00:20:02,469
Where are you kids going?
Can I give you a ride?

283
00:20:04,137 --> 00:20:06,807
KO, I spoke with the medic.
He said everything's fine...

284
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,610
as long as you use
your protective glove when you pee.

285
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:13,280
- What?
- It's a joke.

286
00:20:13,315 --> 00:20:15,015
Yeah, it better be.

287
00:20:16,016 --> 00:20:18,519
That's about the size of it!

288
00:20:35,135 --> 00:20:37,404
Here's to nasty sex,

289
00:20:37,538 --> 00:20:39,940
- and women who never say no.
- Yeah!

290
00:20:40,874 --> 00:20:43,410
Here's to Lucky,

291
00:20:43,477 --> 00:20:45,412
the Marine who gave
his life today.

292
00:20:47,681 --> 00:20:49,216
To Lucky.

293
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:54,254
- In here.
- Okay.

294
00:21:07,801 --> 00:21:09,002
What is this?

295
00:21:12,406 --> 00:21:13,874
Let me take off
your belt.

296
00:21:29,656 --> 00:21:31,458
Oh, baby.

297
00:21:31,658 --> 00:21:33,861
Shake hands with the Big Guy.

298
00:21:37,931 --> 00:21:40,934
Take it easy.
You don't want to hurt Mr. Snake.

299
00:21:44,538 --> 00:21:46,874
What is it?
What's wrong?

300
00:21:49,143 --> 00:21:52,412
Ouch! Not so rough!
You want to take it home with you?

301
00:21:52,546 --> 00:21:54,815
I haven't done anything yet.

302
00:21:56,517 --> 00:21:57,784
Ouch!

303
00:21:57,985 --> 00:21:59,319
What's wrong?

304
00:22:01,522 --> 00:22:02,523
- What?
- God!

305
00:22:08,996 --> 00:22:10,197
What did I do?

306
00:22:13,734 --> 00:22:15,135
Aaah! God!

307
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:19,206
What the hell's
going on in there?

308
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:38,192
Kowalski, my God!
What is it?

309
00:22:40,394 --> 00:22:42,596
Let that be a lesson
to you, lad.

310
00:22:42,663 --> 00:22:44,398
Always wear a prophylactic.

311
00:22:49,269 --> 00:22:50,671
Bernie...

312
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:00,948
Hold it right there,
pilgrim.

313
00:23:02,082 --> 00:23:04,318
I'm not gonna hurt ya.

314
00:23:05,452 --> 00:23:07,521
No, I'm not gonna hurt ya.

315
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:12,726
The hell I'm not!

316
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:21,335
Come on, this is
getting boring.

317
00:23:28,275 --> 00:23:30,144
I think there's someone
in the house.

318
00:23:33,947 --> 00:23:35,549
Get it while
the gettin's good.

319
00:23:35,616 --> 00:23:38,585
- I'm gonna get a refill.
- Get me one, too.

320
00:23:38,785 --> 00:23:42,389
Bring me back a sandwich.
Oh, and a pack of cigarettes.

321
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:46,126
- I'll catch you later.
- He ain't coming back for a while.

322
00:23:46,193 --> 00:23:47,995
He ain't coming back
for a while.

323
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:52,199
Small though I am,
mighty is my spirit

324
00:23:52,234 --> 00:23:54,334
when bloody battle calls.

325
00:23:54,401 --> 00:23:56,902
Come at me
with what you will,

326
00:23:56,937 --> 00:24:00,007
shoot me, stab me,
kill me a hundred ways

327
00:24:00,042 --> 00:24:01,893
and still I fight on.

328
00:24:01,928 --> 00:24:03,744
I am eternal as the sun.

329
00:24:03,811 --> 00:24:06,413
I am a thousand demons
from hell.

330
00:24:06,547 --> 00:24:09,683
Death and destruction
are my game.

331
00:24:09,718 --> 00:24:12,853
Agony is my name!
Ha, ha!

332
00:24:15,389 --> 00:24:17,791
So how's the casualty?

333
00:24:17,858 --> 00:24:20,194
She's resting comfortably,
more or less.

334
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:23,597
We won't be able
to save her hand.

335
00:24:23,632 --> 00:24:25,799
Too much arterial damage.

336
00:24:25,834 --> 00:24:27,267
That's tough.

337
00:24:29,069 --> 00:24:32,272
- So you're a doctor, right?
- A biologist.

338
00:24:32,406 --> 00:24:34,875
A doctor of biology.

339
00:24:35,075 --> 00:24:38,078
That must mean you're
pretty smart, then.

340
00:24:38,212 --> 00:24:40,280
Smart's a relative term.

341
00:24:40,414 --> 00:24:41,882
Relative to what?

342
00:24:42,082 --> 00:24:45,368
Relative to the level
of intelligence you're referring to.

343
00:24:45,403 --> 00:24:48,655
What are the criteria for
determining a person's intelligence?

344
00:24:49,857 --> 00:24:51,258
Uhh...

345
00:24:51,325 --> 00:24:56,463
That means, what standards
do you use? Prerequisites.

346
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:59,933
I know what "criteria" means, Doc,
and what a "prerequisite" is.

347
00:25:00,067 --> 00:25:02,469
See, Doc, just because
I wear this uniform

348
00:25:02,536 --> 00:25:04,738
doesn't mean they've surgically
removed my brain.

349
00:25:04,872 --> 00:25:06,673
Well, I didn't mean...

350
00:25:06,708 --> 00:25:08,475
Anyway...

351
00:25:08,542 --> 00:25:11,545
the point is that
I was just thinking that...

352
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:14,548
I'd kind of like to
get to know you better.

353
00:25:14,681 --> 00:25:17,718
But since you obviously think
of me as a Neanderthal...

354
00:25:17,918 --> 00:25:20,521
- Why are you so defensive?
- I am not defensive.

355
00:25:20,587 --> 00:25:22,589
I'll shoot anyone who says
I'm defensive.

356
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:31,331
Okay, what the hell.

357
00:25:33,934 --> 00:25:37,004
You know what? Why don't we
forget that I was here?

358
00:25:37,137 --> 00:25:38,939
Come back when you're
feeling better.

359
00:25:38,974 --> 00:25:41,008
I feel a lot better
than I look.

360
00:25:45,946 --> 00:25:47,548
I'll bet you do.

361
00:26:05,399 --> 00:26:08,367
I get the impression that
you don't like me.

362
00:26:08,402 --> 00:26:11,872
Don't bother to deny it.
You really don't like me, do you?

363
00:26:18,078 --> 00:26:20,614
First dates are always the hardest.
Oooh!

364
00:26:28,255 --> 00:26:30,724
Damn, 21 st century
and they still can't dance.

365
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,928
They're getting better.

366
00:26:35,128 --> 00:26:36,530
I was about to call
the medics.

367
00:26:37,931 --> 00:26:40,134
Nothing wrong with being a Marine,
is there, Sticks?

368
00:26:40,267 --> 00:26:42,936
Hell no.
Semper fi, do or die.

369
00:26:43,137 --> 00:26:44,872
It's all
I ever wanted to be.

370
00:26:44,938 --> 00:26:46,340
You made it, so be happy.

371
00:26:46,473 --> 00:26:48,475
I am happy...

372
00:26:48,675 --> 00:26:50,944
till somebody like her
comes around.

373
00:26:51,078 --> 00:26:53,547
- You don't like her now?
- No, I do.

374
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,882
That's the problem.

375
00:26:55,082 --> 00:26:57,117
- Wait, come again?
- Come on, think about it.

376
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:59,052
We're not exactly
made for each other.

377
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:01,188
A PhD. And
a high school diploma?

378
00:27:01,321 --> 00:27:03,524
Conversations might tend
to be one-sided.

379
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,993
It depends on
what you're talking about.

380
00:27:06,028 --> 00:27:07,194
That's the problem.

381
00:27:07,327 --> 00:27:09,730
I might not know
what we're talking about.

382
00:27:12,533 --> 00:27:13,801
It's alive!

383
00:27:23,944 --> 00:27:25,546
Hello.

384
00:27:54,274 --> 00:27:56,677
Oh... look at those knees.

385
00:28:02,015 --> 00:28:03,283
Yes!

386
00:28:22,669 --> 00:28:24,138
Impossible!

387
00:28:24,338 --> 00:28:25,873
No, Harold...

388
00:28:26,073 --> 00:28:28,841
it is not impossible.

389
00:28:28,876 --> 00:28:31,345
Her tissues
have regenerated.

390
00:28:34,148 --> 00:28:35,749
I wasn't really...

391
00:28:35,949 --> 00:28:38,519
Yes, Harold,
I know what you were doing.

392
00:28:38,652 --> 00:28:42,122
You are a naughty,
naughty boy.

393
00:28:44,191 --> 00:28:45,891
She is...

394
00:28:45,926 --> 00:28:47,795
amazing, is she not?

395
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:51,999
Yes, sir.

396
00:28:52,199 --> 00:28:54,401
We have work to do.

397
00:28:54,535 --> 00:28:57,337
Do you know what I could do
with her DNA?

398
00:28:59,206 --> 00:29:01,008
Do you, Harold?

399
00:29:01,141 --> 00:29:02,009
No.

400
00:29:02,209 --> 00:29:05,145
You'll tell no one what
you've seen here, understand?

401
00:29:05,212 --> 00:29:06,213
No one.

402
00:29:06,346 --> 00:29:07,948
No one?

403
00:29:08,015 --> 00:29:10,317
But this is a great
discovery!

404
00:29:10,384 --> 00:29:12,084
Yes.

405
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:13,720
But for now...

406
00:29:13,921 --> 00:29:15,789
It will be our secret.

407
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,069
- Take this.
- I don't believe in guns.

408
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:31,872
You need more
than a PhD., Doc.

409
00:29:32,005 --> 00:29:34,808
For your information, Sergeant,
I have a black belt in karate.

410
00:29:34,875 --> 00:29:36,076
Huh.

411
00:29:36,276 --> 00:29:39,079
I needed a merit badge
when I was in the Scouts.

412
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,014
Scouts, huh?

413
00:29:41,081 --> 00:29:43,784
Should have told me earlier.
I would have taken the day off.

414
00:29:50,657 --> 00:29:52,459
It'll take more than penicillin
to fix that shit.

415
00:29:52,526 --> 00:29:54,426
Shut up, Danny!

416
00:29:54,461 --> 00:29:56,130
Knock it off!
Knock it off!

417
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:59,266
We got to find it before
it does any more damage.

418
00:30:00,467 --> 00:30:02,136
All right,
let's check this place out.

419
00:30:02,336 --> 00:30:04,872
You can't go in there.
That's the waste disposal chamber.

420
00:30:04,907 --> 00:30:06,540
We can go anywhere
we want, lady.

421
00:30:06,673 --> 00:30:07,875
We're Marines.

422
00:30:07,941 --> 00:30:11,145
It's filled with
flesh-eating bacteria.

423
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,280
Mooch, you're up.

424
00:30:13,347 --> 00:30:14,548
Hey, wait a minute.

425
00:30:14,681 --> 00:30:16,683
What do you mean,
flesh-eating bacteria?

426
00:30:16,717 --> 00:30:18,852
That's how they dispose
of the organic waste.

427
00:30:19,052 --> 00:30:20,854
He's got to wear
protective clothing.

428
00:30:20,921 --> 00:30:23,257
I can go with him
and show him what to do.

429
00:30:23,323 --> 00:30:25,859
Sergeant, we can't let her
go in there.

430
00:30:25,926 --> 00:30:28,529
I'm the only one who knows how
to run the equipment.

431
00:30:28,595 --> 00:30:29,530
She goes.

432
00:30:30,998 --> 00:30:32,332
I gave you an order.

433
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,535
She goes as far as
the air lock.

434
00:30:34,735 --> 00:30:35,936
Mooch and I go in.

435
00:30:36,003 --> 00:30:37,738
- Yeah.
- All right.

436
00:30:38,739 --> 00:30:40,140
Let's go.

437
00:30:41,742 --> 00:30:43,944
This is the decontamination
chamber.

438
00:30:44,011 --> 00:30:46,912
You'll kill any bacteria
in the air lock.

439
00:30:46,947 --> 00:30:49,616
I'll let you out into
the main chamber from here.

440
00:30:49,716 --> 00:30:51,283
- Got it?
- Yeah, I got it.

441
00:30:51,318 --> 00:30:53,987
- Don't want it, but I got it.
- A walk in the park, right?

442
00:30:54,121 --> 00:30:54,988
- Yeah.
- All right.

443
00:31:11,271 --> 00:31:14,007
Okay, Mooch,
you go that way.

444
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:17,478
Keep in touch, huh?

445
00:31:48,142 --> 00:31:49,943
Hey, Mooch,
are you all right?

446
00:31:50,077 --> 00:31:52,880
Yeah, I'm just doing great.
Let's head back now.

447
00:31:54,081 --> 00:31:55,082
Nope.

448
00:31:57,317 --> 00:31:59,319
- Oh shoot!
- What's the matter, man?

449
00:31:59,453 --> 00:32:01,455
- My God!
- Talk to me, talk to me.

450
00:32:01,522 --> 00:32:03,657
Books... Books!

451
00:32:03,724 --> 00:32:07,327
I'm all right.
Walked into a shitstorm.

452
00:32:07,362 --> 00:32:08,929
Looks like lubricant.

453
00:32:09,062 --> 00:32:11,198
Probably runoff
from the hydraulic system.

454
00:32:18,939 --> 00:32:20,407
Jesus!

455
00:32:20,541 --> 00:32:22,009
God damn!

456
00:32:27,548 --> 00:32:30,918
Books,
I don't think he's here, man.

457
00:32:31,118 --> 00:32:32,786
Yeah,
I guess you're right.

458
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,722
Let's make our way back.
We've wasted enough time already.

459
00:32:35,757 --> 00:32:36,924
Amen.

460
00:32:40,394 --> 00:32:42,930
Mooch, where are you?
What's happening? Mooch!

461
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:47,267
Oh, Jesus!

462
00:32:48,268 --> 00:32:49,203
Books!

463
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,672
Books,
what's happening?

464
00:32:53,073 --> 00:32:55,075
I got you.

465
00:32:55,275 --> 00:32:58,278
You'll be okay.
Hang in there, big guy.

466
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,984
Give me the princess and
I'll spare your miserable lives.

467
00:33:04,019 --> 00:33:05,452
Come out,
you little bastard!

468
00:33:08,255 --> 00:33:10,257
Open the door
for decontamination.

469
00:33:19,666 --> 00:33:21,135
Books, are you all right?

470
00:33:21,335 --> 00:33:22,469
It's Mooch.

471
00:33:25,339 --> 00:33:26,673
Oh, my God.

472
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,321
Hey!

473
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:45,726
I'm sorry.
Do you have an appointment?

474
00:33:47,528 --> 00:33:49,329
Listen,
you pencil-necked geek!

475
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:50,731
You give me the doctor... now,

476
00:33:50,864 --> 00:33:53,734
before I knock out your teeth
and shit down your throat!

477
00:33:55,335 --> 00:33:58,338
Thank you,
I've already had my lunch.

478
00:33:58,373 --> 00:34:00,140
Funny.

479
00:34:00,207 --> 00:34:02,009
Dr. Mittenhand...

480
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:06,013
something wants
to talk to you.

481
00:34:07,014 --> 00:34:10,717
Gentlemen, ladies.

482
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:14,188
I've been expecting you.

483
00:34:14,321 --> 00:34:16,990
I have been tracking
your activities.

484
00:34:17,191 --> 00:34:19,526
I understand that
the creature we are after

485
00:34:19,593 --> 00:34:22,196
has offered to spare us
any more difficulty

486
00:34:22,329 --> 00:34:27,401
if we simply give him the beautiful
princess now resting in my lab.

487
00:34:27,468 --> 00:34:29,069
Yes, sir.

488
00:34:29,203 --> 00:34:32,873
Since we've lost three men already,
it might be a good idea.

489
00:34:33,006 --> 00:34:35,275
I don't agree,
Sergeant.

490
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:37,611
The princes is part of

491
00:34:37,811 --> 00:34:41,081
a very important
scientific experiment.

492
00:34:42,282 --> 00:34:46,186
If that means killing that creature
out there, so be it.

493
00:34:46,386 --> 00:34:48,655
Those are my orders.
Harold, show them out.

494
00:34:48,789 --> 00:34:50,155
Dismissed!

495
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:52,459
Sit your ass down,
Harold.

496
00:34:52,793 --> 00:34:56,196
Sir, with all due respect,
we're not going anywhere.

497
00:34:56,263 --> 00:34:59,199
You refuse to obey me?

498
00:34:59,266 --> 00:35:01,468
I'm not gonna risk
the lives of my men

499
00:35:01,535 --> 00:35:03,902
so you can fart around
with test tubes and formulas.

500
00:35:03,937 --> 00:35:07,674
I say we give her up and we can
all get out of here in one piece.

501
00:35:07,875 --> 00:35:10,544
You dare to defy me?!

502
00:35:10,677 --> 00:35:12,880
In a couple of hours
our contract's up!

503
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,481
When that clock strikes
midnight,

504
00:35:14,548 --> 00:35:16,500
we're climbing
in our shuttle

505
00:35:16,535 --> 00:35:18,452
and we're headed
for home.

506
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:21,655
I think not, Sergeant.

507
00:35:23,257 --> 00:35:24,858
Let's get out of here!

508
00:35:25,058 --> 00:35:27,728
No one leaves this ship
without my permission.

509
00:35:27,861 --> 00:35:29,263
No one!

510
00:35:29,329 --> 00:35:30,664
Yeah, right!

511
00:35:40,741 --> 00:35:43,410
- Holy shit.
- Oh, my God.

512
00:35:49,149 --> 00:35:50,984
Dr. Mittenhand,

513
00:35:51,118 --> 00:35:55,122
you look much taller...
in person.

514
00:35:55,189 --> 00:35:57,324
Thank you, Harold.

515
00:35:57,391 --> 00:35:59,326
I'll do the jokes.

516
00:36:02,529 --> 00:36:06,800
So, I am not what
you expected.

517
00:36:06,934 --> 00:36:08,402
No matter.

518
00:36:08,602 --> 00:36:12,005
Don't look quite so horrified,
Doctor.

519
00:36:12,206 --> 00:36:16,610
I'm still the seductively brilliant
and powerful man I was before.

520
00:36:17,811 --> 00:36:21,281
Rather like
the Wizard of Oz,

521
00:36:21,482 --> 00:36:23,449
I always think,

522
00:36:23,484 --> 00:36:27,254
running things from behind
a curtain.

523
00:36:27,289 --> 00:36:30,057
The only difference,
gentlemen,

524
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:33,794
is that this wizard
is not a fake!

525
00:36:50,677 --> 00:36:53,347
In spite of my appearance,
I'm quite capable

526
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,517
of running this ship
and everything on it.

527
00:36:56,683 --> 00:37:00,854
Make no mistake.
I am in command!

528
00:37:00,889 --> 00:37:02,923
You will do as I say.

529
00:37:04,858 --> 00:37:09,329
We have a contract, Sergeant,
do we not?

530
00:37:09,463 --> 00:37:11,064
Yes.

531
00:37:11,131 --> 00:37:13,066
Your time is up,
it is true.

532
00:37:13,133 --> 00:37:17,871
But subparagraph four
states I have the power

533
00:37:17,938 --> 00:37:22,543
to extend your contract
in the event of an emergency.

534
00:37:22,578 --> 00:37:25,012
And that is what
I'm going to do!

535
00:37:32,186 --> 00:37:35,189
If you disobey my orders...

536
00:37:35,322 --> 00:37:37,925
and refuse to carry them out,

537
00:37:37,991 --> 00:37:39,993
you will be tried for mutiny

538
00:37:40,127 --> 00:37:42,396
and I promise you,
you will be shot!

539
00:37:43,931 --> 00:37:46,934
Lf, on the other hand,
you follow my orders,

540
00:37:47,134 --> 00:37:49,936
and manage to kill
this creature,

541
00:37:49,971 --> 00:37:52,739
I will arrange
a very generous bonus

542
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,608
for each of you.

543
00:37:54,643 --> 00:37:55,876
How much?

544
00:37:56,009 --> 00:38:00,881
Say one hundred times
what you're being paid now.

545
00:38:01,014 --> 00:38:03,048
- Sounds good to me.
- I'm in.

546
00:38:03,083 --> 00:38:05,986
You can count me in.
But I'm not doing it for the money.

547
00:38:06,021 --> 00:38:07,788
I'm doing this for Kowalski.

548
00:38:07,988 --> 00:38:09,456
Books?

549
00:38:09,656 --> 00:38:10,858
I'm a Marine, Sarge.

550
00:38:10,991 --> 00:38:14,595
You want me to stay,
I'll stay.

551
00:38:14,661 --> 00:38:17,397
Anybody who stays
becomes a shareholder...

552
00:38:17,598 --> 00:38:19,466
of everything you make
on this deal.

553
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,202
And we want 5%
of the gross...

554
00:38:22,269 --> 00:38:24,671
of everything you bring
out of that cave.

555
00:38:24,805 --> 00:38:26,972
Anything over 50 million,

556
00:38:27,007 --> 00:38:29,543
we get another point
as a bonus.

557
00:38:29,676 --> 00:38:32,546
Two and a half percent
of the mineral rights.

558
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:35,149
That's net, not gross.
No bonus.

559
00:38:35,282 --> 00:38:37,918
Four percent.
No deal without the bonus.

560
00:38:38,051 --> 00:38:40,053
- Three percent with the bonus.
- Done!

561
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,655
I'll have the papers
drawn up.

562
00:38:43,657 --> 00:38:46,059
One more thing.
If I lose any more of my troop,

563
00:38:46,094 --> 00:38:47,728
your ass is grass!

564
00:38:49,329 --> 00:38:52,065
If you've even got an ass!
Let's go!

565
00:38:54,067 --> 00:38:56,136
Call me if you need me.

566
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:13,787
Sticks...

567
00:39:13,987 --> 00:39:15,989
- you and Danny take the sub-levels.
- Yes, sir.

568
00:39:16,123 --> 00:39:17,356
- Books...
- Sir?

569
00:39:17,391 --> 00:39:20,594
You and Cupcake take the engine room
and everything around it.

570
00:39:20,727 --> 00:39:21,929
- Delores...
- Sarge?

571
00:39:21,964 --> 00:39:23,530
You're with me.

572
00:39:23,597 --> 00:39:25,732
Stay close. Stay in touch,
and use your locators

573
00:39:25,799 --> 00:39:27,601
to track that alien.
Move out!

574
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:35,542
Good lads,
stouthearted and brave.

575
00:39:35,609 --> 00:39:37,611
Seems almost a pity
to kill them.

576
00:39:37,678 --> 00:39:41,482
But the path to power is often
soiled with innocent blood

577
00:39:41,615 --> 00:39:45,185
and I will let nothing
stop me from becoming a king.

578
00:39:45,252 --> 00:39:48,188
I'll have power and glory...

579
00:39:48,255 --> 00:39:51,658
and a beautiful queen
to share it with.

580
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,596
"Share. "

581
00:39:55,662 --> 00:39:58,999
There's a word that lies
crooked upon me.

582
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:02,202
The very sound of it sets
my teeth to grate.

583
00:40:02,402 --> 00:40:05,405
Conjures up pictures of me gold
being carted off

584
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,973
to pay for feminine
pleasures,

585
00:40:08,008 --> 00:40:11,211
leaving me with less than
what I want.

586
00:40:11,246 --> 00:40:13,947
And what I want is everything.

587
00:40:15,082 --> 00:40:17,851
I'll wed her,
bed her, and bury her,

588
00:40:17,886 --> 00:40:21,054
all in the same day.
Ha ha!

589
00:40:21,121 --> 00:40:25,259
I wonder if her father will pay
for the wedding and the funeral.

590
00:40:45,279 --> 00:40:47,014
- What's wrong?
- It ain't working.

591
00:40:47,147 --> 00:40:49,349
Shit!

592
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:52,386
- Sarge, you there?
- Yeah.

593
00:40:52,586 --> 00:40:54,521
Our locator isn't working,

594
00:40:54,588 --> 00:40:56,790
so if anybody spots him...

595
00:40:56,924 --> 00:40:58,157
All right.

596
00:40:58,192 --> 00:40:59,927
- Ready?
- Listen close, man.

597
00:40:59,993 --> 00:41:02,396
- Let's sit this one out.
- Say what?

598
00:41:02,529 --> 00:41:05,732
We find a nice, safe place to
hold up till they catch the bastard.

599
00:41:05,933 --> 00:41:07,601
We collect our bonus
and go home.

600
00:41:07,734 --> 00:41:10,604
Why risk our lives for that maniac,
Dr. Mittenhand?

601
00:41:10,737 --> 00:41:13,407
Did you get a look
at that guy?

602
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:14,942
He ain't hardly human.

603
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:16,308
This isn't about him.

604
00:41:16,343 --> 00:41:19,146
It's about us sticking
together and doing our job.

605
00:41:19,213 --> 00:41:22,483
I ain't taking any chances,
you understand?

606
00:41:22,616 --> 00:41:24,051
Move your ass, Danny.

607
00:41:42,669 --> 00:41:44,404
You wait here.

608
00:41:44,471 --> 00:41:46,073
I'll check out the next level.

609
00:41:46,206 --> 00:41:48,008
I'll go first.

610
00:41:56,717 --> 00:42:00,120
I'm ready to proceed, Doctor.
I've got a sample of her blood.

611
00:42:03,457 --> 00:42:04,925
Ahem...

612
00:42:06,326 --> 00:42:08,061
Gentle.

613
00:42:11,865 --> 00:42:13,133
Sorry.

614
00:42:50,137 --> 00:42:52,739
I am brilliant!

615
00:43:10,257 --> 00:43:12,192
- Hey, Sarge?
- Yeah?

616
00:43:13,794 --> 00:43:17,264
You don't think Kowalski's
gettin' killed was my fault, do you?

617
00:43:17,397 --> 00:43:18,599
What do you mean?

618
00:43:21,001 --> 00:43:24,471
I mean, I'm the one
who gave him a boner.

619
00:43:25,606 --> 00:43:28,675
Forget about it. Kowalski
would have wanted it that way.

620
00:43:28,876 --> 00:43:31,176
He was a Marine.

621
00:43:31,211 --> 00:43:34,414
Come to think of it,
when it's my time to go...

622
00:43:34,615 --> 00:43:37,050
I hope I'm standing tall
like he was.

623
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,854
Really?

624
00:44:01,942 --> 00:44:04,945
Lordy, Mr. Daniels,
it sure be dark in here.

625
00:44:05,078 --> 00:44:06,280
Laugh it up, wise guy.

626
00:44:06,346 --> 00:44:09,883
Won't be so funny when that bastard
shoves a laser up your ass.

627
00:44:09,917 --> 00:44:14,588
A laser up my ass?
Come on, feets, don't fail me now!

628
00:44:14,623 --> 00:44:16,990
Come on, Mr. Daniels.

629
00:44:17,025 --> 00:44:18,325
Dick.

630
00:44:31,538 --> 00:44:34,007
Got him.
Sarge?

631
00:44:34,141 --> 00:44:36,009
Yeah.

632
00:44:36,143 --> 00:44:38,345
- He's here.
- Where are you?

633
00:44:38,412 --> 00:44:41,215
Engine room.

634
00:44:41,348 --> 00:44:44,718
Everyone copy that?
Sticks? Danny?

635
00:44:47,454 --> 00:44:49,456
Getting nothing.
No static, nothing.

636
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:51,658
It's because we're in a deep,
dark hole.

637
00:44:51,859 --> 00:44:53,260
Let's get outta here.

638
00:44:53,393 --> 00:44:54,595
Sticks?

639
00:44:55,863 --> 00:44:57,798
Hang in there, Books.
We're on our way.

640
00:45:00,267 --> 00:45:01,802
We're going after him,
aren't we?

641
00:45:01,869 --> 00:45:03,270
Not "we. "
Me.

642
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:05,272
You're going back.
I'm waiting for the others.

643
00:45:05,472 --> 00:45:08,275
Damn it! I am part of this operation.
I have a job to do!

644
00:45:08,408 --> 00:45:11,879
Part of my job is making sure
that nothing happens to you.

645
00:45:12,012 --> 00:45:13,080
I'm not going back.

646
00:45:13,213 --> 00:45:14,615
- Listen, Doc, you don't...
- Tina.

647
00:45:14,681 --> 00:45:17,015
- What?
- My name is Tina.

648
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:19,586
Listen, Tina,
you're in the way here.

649
00:45:19,653 --> 00:45:22,055
You can't shoot a gun.
You're not trained for combat.

650
00:45:22,122 --> 00:45:23,524
You'll get us both killed.

651
00:45:23,657 --> 00:45:27,661
I can assure you I am quite
capable of taking care of myself.

652
00:45:27,728 --> 00:45:31,665
Okay, fine, we'll both go.
You go first.

653
00:45:31,865 --> 00:45:33,534
- You go first.
- God!

654
00:45:54,254 --> 00:45:56,323
You're busted, lad.

655
00:45:56,390 --> 00:45:58,325
Give me back the princess,

656
00:45:58,392 --> 00:46:01,128
or I'll barbecue your buns
to a crisp.

657
00:46:05,732 --> 00:46:06,800
Get out of here.
Go!

658
00:46:06,934 --> 00:46:09,403
- What about you?
- Never mind me. Get outta here!

659
00:46:09,438 --> 00:46:12,539
How do you like it?
Medium or well done?

660
00:46:14,541 --> 00:46:15,809
I'm not leaving you here!

661
00:46:21,348 --> 00:46:22,549
Get outta here!

662
00:46:22,616 --> 00:46:24,318
Hot stuff, coming up!

663
00:46:32,259 --> 00:46:33,393
Go!

664
00:46:37,998 --> 00:46:39,466
Get on the hoist.
Let's go.

665
00:46:43,203 --> 00:46:45,205
- You on?
- Uh-huh.

666
00:46:45,405 --> 00:46:46,607
Going up.

667
00:46:49,810 --> 00:46:52,880
Clever, lad.
But I'll roast you yet.

668
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:55,616
This barbecue's only
just begun.

669
00:47:00,387 --> 00:47:01,855
Are you all right?

670
00:47:02,055 --> 00:47:03,857
You saved my life.

671
00:47:06,059 --> 00:47:07,661
Part of the job.

672
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:11,131
You can put me down, now.

673
00:47:15,536 --> 00:47:17,738
You're really good
with that rifle.

674
00:47:17,938 --> 00:47:20,506
Maybe I could...

675
00:47:20,541 --> 00:47:22,476
teach you
how to use it some time.

676
00:47:23,477 --> 00:47:25,879
I don't think that
I'm the killer type.

677
00:47:28,282 --> 00:47:31,318
Right time, right place...

678
00:47:31,452 --> 00:47:33,120
we're all killers.

679
00:47:37,524 --> 00:47:38,725
- Hey, Sarge.
- You get him?

680
00:47:38,926 --> 00:47:40,928
He got away.
Where's Danny and Sticks?

681
00:47:40,994 --> 00:47:42,329
I don't know.

682
00:47:42,396 --> 00:47:45,399
I gave the order to converge.
Must be on their way.

683
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:49,136
Sarge, you read me?

684
00:47:49,336 --> 00:47:50,604
Books?

685
00:47:53,807 --> 00:47:54,942
Anybody?

686
00:47:55,142 --> 00:47:57,744
Damn it. I told you we should
have never come down here.

687
00:47:58,011 --> 00:47:59,947
Will you relax, Danny!

688
00:48:00,147 --> 00:48:01,949
Cheap-ass equipment.
Nothing works.

689
00:48:02,015 --> 00:48:03,317
Gotta be an exit
coming up soon.

690
00:48:05,385 --> 00:48:06,520
What the hell was that?

691
00:48:07,988 --> 00:48:09,790
Hello?

692
00:48:09,923 --> 00:48:12,126
Anybody here?

693
00:48:12,593 --> 00:48:14,595
I think we found him.

694
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:16,463
I'm outta here.

695
00:48:16,663 --> 00:48:18,465
Danny,
get your ass back here.

696
00:48:35,215 --> 00:48:36,984
Danny!

697
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:37,985
Shit.

698
00:48:38,051 --> 00:48:40,053
Danny, open the door.
My light went out.

699
00:48:40,254 --> 00:48:41,855
That's an order.

700
00:48:44,792 --> 00:48:46,460
Hello, Danny boy.

701
00:48:46,593 --> 00:48:49,530
Let's talk about safety
in the workplace.

702
00:48:54,268 --> 00:48:55,135
Oops!

703
00:48:57,671 --> 00:49:00,541
Be very careful when handling
sharp instruments.

704
00:49:04,278 --> 00:49:06,146
And watch out
for naked flames.

705
00:49:08,749 --> 00:49:11,251
As Shakespeare said,
"Shit happens. "

706
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:20,127
"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes,
the pipes are playing... "

707
00:49:24,998 --> 00:49:28,402
What's the matter, lad?
Don't like me singing?

708
00:49:28,602 --> 00:49:30,404
Listen to me.

709
00:49:30,604 --> 00:49:33,006
I got no fight with you.

710
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:35,008
You want that alien broad?
Take her.

711
00:49:35,209 --> 00:49:37,211
Hell, I don't care.

712
00:49:37,344 --> 00:49:39,213
You understand?

713
00:49:39,346 --> 00:49:40,814
I just want to live.

714
00:49:41,014 --> 00:49:45,119
Of course you do.
But I'm not after you, lad.

715
00:49:45,185 --> 00:49:47,721
- You're not?
- No.

716
00:49:47,788 --> 00:49:51,191
As a matter of fact,
I could use your help.

717
00:49:51,325 --> 00:49:53,193
Oh, yeah?

718
00:49:53,327 --> 00:49:57,464
Yeah. Maybe we could
be partners.

719
00:49:57,664 --> 00:49:59,600
That'd be okay with me.

720
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:03,670
But, uh, I don't know if
I could trust you, lad.

721
00:50:03,804 --> 00:50:05,672
Nah, you could trust me.

722
00:50:05,873 --> 00:50:09,610
Let's talk it over,
face to face.

723
00:50:09,645 --> 00:50:12,613
Sure. Why not?

724
00:50:12,679 --> 00:50:13,846
Where are you?

725
00:50:13,881 --> 00:50:16,884
Over here.
Behind these pipes.

726
00:50:19,052 --> 00:50:20,587
I'll be right there.

727
00:50:28,595 --> 00:50:31,465
Where are you,
Danny boy?

728
00:50:31,598 --> 00:50:33,734
Right here.

729
00:50:36,737 --> 00:50:37,938
Aaahh!

730
00:50:42,943 --> 00:50:46,280
Smashing.
Simply smashing.

731
00:51:03,330 --> 00:51:06,400
Harold,
prepare the DNA.

732
00:51:06,533 --> 00:51:09,568
I have computed the formula.

733
00:51:09,603 --> 00:51:11,738
May I say
what an honor it is...

734
00:51:11,805 --> 00:51:15,342
to be working with
such a great genius?

735
00:51:15,409 --> 00:51:21,014
May I say how much I loathe
and despise toadies like you?

736
00:51:21,148 --> 00:51:22,514
Thank you.

737
00:51:22,549 --> 00:51:25,986
May I say what an honor
it is to be despised

738
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:28,522
by such a magnificent mind?

739
00:51:28,722 --> 00:51:31,792
- Oh, shut up.
- I'd love to. Thank you.

740
00:51:31,992 --> 00:51:35,195
Harold, I wonder
if your tiny brain

741
00:51:35,329 --> 00:51:40,000
could even begin to comprehend
how important this is to me.

742
00:51:40,134 --> 00:51:43,604
For years I have dreamt
of the opportunity

743
00:51:43,639 --> 00:51:46,807
to rejoin the human race.

744
00:51:46,874 --> 00:51:51,211
Did you know that I was once
considered quite dashing?

745
00:51:51,278 --> 00:51:52,880
Really?

746
00:51:53,013 --> 00:51:55,215
Of course.

747
00:51:55,282 --> 00:51:59,386
And then...
the experiment.

748
00:52:02,055 --> 00:52:05,592
- ¿The experiment?
- Yes.

749
00:52:05,793 --> 00:52:08,796
I would have been
the first computer

750
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:10,998
with an organic structure.

751
00:52:12,399 --> 00:52:14,401
Something went wrong.

752
00:52:14,601 --> 00:52:18,138
No, Harold, it all went
according to plan.

753
00:52:18,272 --> 00:52:21,507
Moron! Look at me!

754
00:52:21,542 --> 00:52:25,345
But now, with her DNA...

755
00:52:25,479 --> 00:52:29,283
I shall recreate Mittenhand.

756
00:52:29,349 --> 00:52:32,853
I shall rise like a phoenix
from the ashes

757
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:37,524
and stand triumphant
before the world.

758
00:52:37,658 --> 00:52:42,129
I shall be beautiful!

759
00:52:43,263 --> 00:52:45,065
Cool.

760
00:52:48,869 --> 00:52:50,604
Delores, you're up.

761
00:53:12,793 --> 00:53:14,194
Clear.

762
00:53:18,398 --> 00:53:19,533
Shit!

763
00:53:21,602 --> 00:53:23,537
Books,
what's going on?

764
00:53:25,405 --> 00:53:27,407
Books, open it!

765
00:53:27,474 --> 00:53:28,475
Access denied.

766
00:53:28,675 --> 00:53:30,410
Get it open!
Get her, Books!

767
00:53:31,879 --> 00:53:33,213
Try it again, Delores.

768
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,682
- Won't work.
- Access denied.

769
00:53:36,884 --> 00:53:38,385
- It's the wiring.
- Hurry up!

770
00:53:42,790 --> 00:53:43,857
Come on.

771
00:53:46,393 --> 00:53:48,262
Access denied.

772
00:53:48,395 --> 00:53:50,864
Couldn't your friends
make it, lass?

773
00:53:51,064 --> 00:53:52,065
What's going on?

774
00:53:54,468 --> 00:53:55,602
Too bad.

775
00:53:57,805 --> 00:53:59,273
Take this,
you son of a bitch.

776
00:54:08,482 --> 00:54:10,250
Sarge! I got him!

777
00:54:11,852 --> 00:54:14,922
- Yeah, way to go, Delores!
- Great shot, Delores!

778
00:54:17,858 --> 00:54:20,461
All right.
One for the good guys.

779
00:54:30,471 --> 00:54:31,872
Aaahhh!

780
00:54:31,939 --> 00:54:34,141
Shit. Open up.
Get it open, Books.

781
00:54:39,146 --> 00:54:40,747
You like hanging around, eh?

782
00:54:44,184 --> 00:54:45,786
But there's no future
in that.

783
00:54:48,122 --> 00:54:49,790
Hang in there, Marine!

784
00:54:49,923 --> 00:54:52,126
How about a little game
me mother taught me?

785
00:54:54,928 --> 00:54:57,331
This little piggy
went to market.

786
00:54:57,397 --> 00:55:00,000
This little piggy
stayed at home.

787
00:55:01,535 --> 00:55:03,137
Hang on, Delores.
Come on, man!

788
00:55:04,938 --> 00:55:07,207
This little piggy
had bread and butter.

789
00:55:09,610 --> 00:55:10,811
Open it up!

790
00:55:12,212 --> 00:55:14,882
And this little piggy went...

791
00:55:15,082 --> 00:55:16,884
"Wee, wee, wee,"
all the way home!

792
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:23,791
Got it! Go!

793
00:55:23,857 --> 00:55:24,792
Come on!

794
00:55:28,262 --> 00:55:29,263
Delores!

795
00:55:33,066 --> 00:55:34,668
Let's go!

796
00:55:54,054 --> 00:55:55,656
Delores.

797
00:56:02,863 --> 00:56:04,465
Tina, she's gone.

798
00:56:14,942 --> 00:56:16,610
Kill him.

799
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:37,731
You heard her...

800
00:56:38,999 --> 00:56:40,934
Let's get
that son of a bitch.

801
00:56:59,186 --> 00:57:01,255
It's ready.

802
00:57:01,388 --> 00:57:03,056
Finally!

803
00:57:09,263 --> 00:57:14,067
Ahh, the delicate scent
of my own true love.

804
00:57:18,806 --> 00:57:20,607
Harold, see who's
at the door.

805
00:57:31,919 --> 00:57:34,455
Let me in, please.
They tore off all my clothes.

806
00:57:34,655 --> 00:57:36,256
Let me in
before they come back.

807
00:57:36,291 --> 00:57:37,724
? Dr. Reeves?

808
00:57:37,858 --> 00:57:39,927
Just open the door.
Hurry.

809
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:41,862
Okay, hang on.

810
00:57:41,929 --> 00:57:43,931
I have to disable
the security system.

811
00:57:51,738 --> 00:57:55,075
Oh, thank you, thank you.

812
00:57:55,142 --> 00:57:57,344
You saved my life.

813
00:58:08,789 --> 00:58:11,125
Aughh!

814
00:58:11,325 --> 00:58:14,194
Hold that for me,
will you, lad?

815
00:58:14,229 --> 00:58:15,996
Make way for the king.

816
00:58:23,203 --> 00:58:25,806
Now where's
me future queen?

817
00:58:25,939 --> 00:58:29,543
You, lad.
Where is she?

818
00:58:29,610 --> 00:58:32,412
You are the monster?

819
00:58:32,546 --> 00:58:34,414
You?!

820
00:58:37,050 --> 00:58:39,853
Oh, I'm sorry.
I really don't want to be rude...

821
00:58:39,987 --> 00:58:44,458
but I had no idea.
How very tall you are.

822
00:58:44,591 --> 00:58:47,594
How wonderfully amusing!

823
00:58:47,661 --> 00:58:49,997
You find me laughable?

824
00:58:50,063 --> 00:58:52,399
Only slightly, dear boy,
only slightly.

825
00:58:56,003 --> 00:59:00,007
And I suppose now
you'll want to kill me.

826
00:59:01,475 --> 00:59:05,978
Which part is it
that still lives?

827
00:59:06,013 --> 00:59:09,283
Is it the arm, or the bald thing
in the middle?

828
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:12,252
Touché.
Yes, very good!

829
00:59:14,721 --> 00:59:16,924
But do not
let my appearance

830
00:59:17,057 --> 00:59:18,859
fool you.

831
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:22,329
I was about to say
the same thing.

832
00:59:36,076 --> 00:59:41,148
Perhaps we could come...
to an arrangement.

833
00:59:42,549 --> 00:59:45,719
It appears to me that
we have a lot in common.

834
00:59:45,754 --> 00:59:47,387
You are a monster,

835
00:59:47,521 --> 00:59:51,258
and in my own charming way,
so am I.

836
00:59:51,293 --> 00:59:54,995
I am greedy,
and you are insatiable.

837
00:59:55,195 --> 00:59:59,399
Two peas in a pod,
don't you think?

838
01:00:03,937 --> 01:00:08,208
You ought to know that
what I want, you can't give me.

839
01:00:08,243 --> 01:00:11,011
I want a throne.
I want to be king.

840
01:00:11,145 --> 01:00:13,614
I want people groveling
at me feet.

841
01:00:13,814 --> 01:00:16,216
I want respect.

842
01:00:16,416 --> 01:00:19,186
Respect is nothing!

843
01:00:19,386 --> 01:00:22,990
Fear is what makes
the universe go round, my friend.

844
01:00:23,056 --> 01:00:25,392
Fear is what you want.

845
01:00:25,459 --> 01:00:27,861
Unfortunately...

846
01:00:28,061 --> 01:00:30,264
you won't live
long enough

847
01:00:30,397 --> 01:00:32,866
to frighten anyone
ever again.

848
01:00:34,468 --> 01:00:35,602
Harold.

849
01:00:37,004 --> 01:00:38,472
Aaaahh!

850
01:00:43,610 --> 01:00:45,412
Thanks for returning it, lad.

851
01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:16,276
Now, me boyo,
it's time you were punished.

852
01:01:25,252 --> 01:01:27,121
I got him. He's in the lab.
Let's go!

853
01:01:41,535 --> 01:01:42,536
Aaaahh!

854
01:01:45,939 --> 01:01:48,342
She loves me.

855
01:01:48,408 --> 01:01:51,145
Oh, it's you.

856
01:01:51,211 --> 01:01:55,349
I had a dream that
he was draining my blood.

857
01:01:55,416 --> 01:01:56,917
Destroy him.

858
01:01:56,984 --> 01:01:58,786
Yes, of course.

859
01:01:58,919 --> 01:02:02,189
But I have something wonderful
in store for him, my lovely.

860
01:02:11,265 --> 01:02:12,466
DNA.

861
01:02:27,614 --> 01:02:30,784
"All things bright
and beautiful,

862
01:02:30,851 --> 01:02:34,054
All creatures great and small... "

863
01:02:34,188 --> 01:02:36,457
A little added spice.

864
01:03:02,750 --> 01:03:04,318
Dinner is served.

865
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:10,524
Now, let's see if we can't get this
through your thick skull.

866
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:12,326
...Doctor.

867
01:03:25,405 --> 01:03:28,742
You like it, lad?
It's from an old family recipe.

868
01:03:37,317 --> 01:03:39,119
Someone's coming.

869
01:03:39,154 --> 01:03:40,721
Good.

870
01:03:52,866 --> 01:03:55,268
Don't shoot at any
of the hostages.

871
01:03:55,303 --> 01:03:57,671
Let them go
or you're dead meat!

872
01:03:58,071 --> 01:03:59,606
Take a bite out of this.

873
01:04:08,015 --> 01:04:08,816
Come on!

874
01:04:14,788 --> 01:04:15,856
Ouch!

875
01:04:17,191 --> 01:04:18,926
It's burning!

876
01:04:19,126 --> 01:04:20,527
This way, dear.

877
01:04:24,731 --> 01:04:26,066
Books, help her out!

878
01:04:39,079 --> 01:04:40,347
Move out!

879
01:04:42,549 --> 01:04:45,519
Oh, God...
Dr. Mittenhand.

880
01:04:48,722 --> 01:04:49,923
All right,
I'm taking him out.

881
01:04:50,057 --> 01:04:52,059
No! You'll kill the hostage.

882
01:04:52,259 --> 01:04:53,492
It's them or us.

883
01:04:53,527 --> 01:04:56,396
I want him as bad as you,
but we can't kill innocent people.

884
01:04:56,530 --> 01:04:58,532
She's a member of
the Domininan royal family.

885
01:04:58,599 --> 01:05:00,801
I don't give a damn
if she's the Queen of Soul.

886
01:05:00,934 --> 01:05:02,936
That bastard killed Delores,
and I'm taking him out!

887
01:05:03,003 --> 01:05:04,605
- No you're not!
- Sticks, at ease!

888
01:05:04,805 --> 01:05:07,207
Cupcake's right.
We can't hurt the hostage.

889
01:05:07,407 --> 01:05:09,409
Books, you're up.

890
01:05:09,543 --> 01:05:10,611
Cover me.

891
01:05:23,123 --> 01:05:25,793
What is the meaning
of this intrusion?

892
01:05:25,828 --> 01:05:27,394
Lady, are you all right?

893
01:05:27,594 --> 01:05:31,398
Kneel before me, swine.
I am the future Queen of Dominia.

894
01:05:31,433 --> 01:05:33,000
Where is he?

895
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:36,270
That is none of your business,
you impertinent moron.

896
01:05:36,403 --> 01:05:40,274
You really are beginning
to annoy me. Not a wise idea.

897
01:05:40,407 --> 01:05:42,476
I'm right here, laddies.

898
01:05:43,477 --> 01:05:45,879
Hold your fire,
hold your fire.

899
01:05:45,914 --> 01:05:48,247
Bullshit!
Blow his brains out!

900
01:05:48,282 --> 01:05:51,385
Can't do that, Sarge.
He's got the detonator.

901
01:05:51,452 --> 01:05:52,786
Right you are, lad.

902
01:05:52,853 --> 01:05:56,523
If you want to stay in one piece,
keep your distance.

903
01:05:56,558 --> 01:06:00,194
The princess and I will take
our hostage elsewhere.

904
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:02,663
Your Highness.

905
01:06:02,863 --> 01:06:06,733
You may find this cruel, but your
behavior leaves me no choice.

906
01:06:07,935 --> 01:06:10,137
This is your fate.

907
01:06:11,138 --> 01:06:14,341
You have no one to blame
but yourselves.

908
01:06:14,376 --> 01:06:17,745
Unspeakable pain awaits you.

909
01:06:17,945 --> 01:06:20,547
Yeah? Well, hurt me first.

910
01:06:20,681 --> 01:06:24,251
Look upon them and know
that you are forever doomed,

911
01:06:24,318 --> 01:06:27,321
for I am she
who is all-powerful.

912
01:06:27,521 --> 01:06:31,058
I am Zarina,
Queen of the Damned.

913
01:06:33,861 --> 01:06:35,929
I leave you now...

914
01:06:36,063 --> 01:06:38,932
to ponder the remainder
of your pathetic existence.

915
01:06:42,002 --> 01:06:44,204
Come. We go.

916
01:06:44,239 --> 01:06:46,406
Atten-hut!

917
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:47,608
Yes, sir!

918
01:06:47,741 --> 01:06:49,943
- I can't hear you!
- Sir! Yes, sir!

919
01:06:50,144 --> 01:06:53,213
About face!

920
01:06:53,347 --> 01:06:55,816
Forward march!

921
01:07:00,587 --> 01:07:03,991
That girl sure knows how
to get your attention.

922
01:07:04,124 --> 01:07:06,593
Don't get too excited, boys.

923
01:07:06,794 --> 01:07:10,798
On Dominia, when a woman of royal
blood shows you her breasts...

924
01:07:10,864 --> 01:07:13,200
it's a death sentence.

925
01:07:13,267 --> 01:07:16,069
What part of her anatomy
is she gonna kill me with?

926
01:07:25,813 --> 01:07:27,614
What the hell...?

927
01:07:29,283 --> 01:07:30,451
Come on, Tina.

928
01:07:37,458 --> 01:07:39,993
Hup... Right!
Hup... Right...

929
01:07:40,194 --> 01:07:42,029
We will return to Dominia
in triumph.

930
01:07:42,064 --> 01:07:43,864
You will sweep my father
from his throne,

931
01:07:43,997 --> 01:07:46,667
- and we shall rule the world.
- Yes, my queen.

932
01:07:46,702 --> 01:07:47,935
But first...

933
01:07:50,070 --> 01:07:52,072
...you must execute
these peasants.

934
01:07:52,139 --> 01:07:53,540
Have them boiled in oil.

935
01:07:53,674 --> 01:07:55,542
Or, perhaps we shall enjoy
seeing them eaten

936
01:07:55,676 --> 01:07:57,311
by the wild dogs of Naytron.

937
01:07:57,346 --> 01:07:58,946
Leave it to me,
my lovely.

938
01:07:59,079 --> 01:08:01,882
They shall pay dearly
for their insolence.

939
01:08:02,082 --> 01:08:03,317
Sir! Yes, sir!

940
01:08:12,259 --> 01:08:13,927
"I know a girl
who lives on the hill.

941
01:08:14,061 --> 01:08:16,864
She don't do it,
but her sister will. "

942
01:08:16,930 --> 01:08:18,332
Sir! Yes, sir!

943
01:08:18,465 --> 01:08:20,334
Right shoulder... arms!

944
01:08:22,002 --> 01:08:23,804
Now, me boyo,

945
01:08:23,937 --> 01:08:27,007
we'll show them what kind of man
you really are.

946
01:08:39,319 --> 01:08:42,322
Come on... you little freak.
Where are you at?

947
01:08:54,468 --> 01:08:58,405
"He was standing on the corner
of 31 st and Main,

948
01:08:58,605 --> 01:09:00,607
I was feelin' kinda flirty... "

949
01:09:00,808 --> 01:09:02,076
Sarge?

950
01:09:02,609 --> 01:09:05,813
"... then I knocked him
off his feet... "

951
01:09:13,854 --> 01:09:16,990
This should be a darlin'
floor show. Don't you think?

952
01:09:17,057 --> 01:09:19,193
Sarge, it's me.
It's Books.

953
01:09:21,662 --> 01:09:23,664
Love of my life,
why are we wasting time here?

954
01:09:23,699 --> 01:09:27,601
Someone could be collecting
your gold.

955
01:09:27,668 --> 01:09:28,669
Me gold?

956
01:09:30,337 --> 01:09:31,672
Whoa... Sarge.

957
01:09:34,541 --> 01:09:36,076
Where is it?

958
01:09:36,276 --> 01:09:40,147
Someplace called...
"Cargo Bay. "

959
01:09:45,052 --> 01:09:46,453
Delightful little fellow.

960
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:48,922
I shall give him
a splendid funeral.

961
01:09:51,525 --> 01:09:54,128
Sarge, this is a plan, right?
You look very nice.

962
01:09:54,261 --> 01:09:56,263
But tell me,
where's the alien?

963
01:09:57,731 --> 01:10:01,268
Sarge... Sarge!
It's me. Knock it off.

964
01:10:05,205 --> 01:10:07,808
What is your malfunction, Sticks?

965
01:10:07,941 --> 01:10:10,210
Oh... I can't go on
like this.

966
01:10:11,612 --> 01:10:13,414
Attention.
Nunchucks.

967
01:10:21,121 --> 01:10:24,124
- Books, I'm gonna take him out.
- Sticks, no!

968
01:10:24,324 --> 01:10:26,994
- He saved my life.
- He's gonna kill us.

969
01:10:44,878 --> 01:10:47,815
I can walk!

970
01:11:02,396 --> 01:11:03,997
All right. That's it.

971
01:11:04,064 --> 01:11:06,600
I think we've been
very patient with you, Sergeant.

972
01:11:06,667 --> 01:11:09,203
Now it's time to
get serious... "Cupcake. "

973
01:11:29,323 --> 01:11:33,927
Due to interference,
my experiment has gone awry.

974
01:11:34,061 --> 01:11:37,131
I am becoming a mutant,

975
01:11:37,331 --> 01:11:40,934
my brain slowly losing
human perspective.

976
01:11:42,336 --> 01:11:44,738
I am no longer Mittenhand.

977
01:11:46,540 --> 01:11:51,011
I am now... Mitten-spider.

978
01:11:56,784 --> 01:11:58,786
Damn. Nice moves.

979
01:11:58,919 --> 01:12:01,121
Thank you. If you'd like,
I could give you a lesson.

980
01:12:03,323 --> 01:12:04,556
Uh-oh...

981
01:12:04,591 --> 01:12:07,594
Kill!
Kill, kill, kill, kill!

982
01:12:12,599 --> 01:12:15,602
This is far too violent.
Shut up, you pussy!

983
01:12:15,736 --> 01:12:17,404
I've had such a headache.

984
01:12:17,604 --> 01:12:20,207
You're a Marine.
Snap out of it!

985
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:22,076
I can't.
Kill!

986
01:12:25,079 --> 01:12:26,680
No, don't shoot
We can handle it.

987
01:12:33,987 --> 01:12:36,056
Why are you stopping?

988
01:12:36,190 --> 01:12:38,859
I don't want them
following me to me gold.

989
01:12:38,992 --> 01:12:41,462
They'll have to be destroyed.
All of them.

990
01:12:41,595 --> 01:12:44,798
Well, it's about time.
Do it. Do it.

991
01:12:44,998 --> 01:12:46,400
Bitch.

992
01:12:46,467 --> 01:12:47,801
Twerp.

993
01:13:01,281 --> 01:13:02,848
Come on!

994
01:13:02,883 --> 01:13:04,318
Come on, you bastard! Come on.

995
01:13:23,737 --> 01:13:26,473
He wasn't even human.

996
01:13:26,508 --> 01:13:28,275
Cyborg.

997
01:13:30,144 --> 01:13:32,546
Human or not,
he was a Marine.

998
01:13:32,613 --> 01:13:34,615
The best.

999
01:13:34,748 --> 01:13:36,917
Now... off with their heads!

1000
01:13:39,386 --> 01:13:42,790
Attention... attention,
all ship's personnel.

1001
01:13:42,923 --> 01:13:46,193
The ship's auto-destruct
has been activated.

1002
01:13:46,326 --> 01:13:48,128
You have 20 minutes
to abandon ship.

1003
01:13:48,163 --> 01:13:49,930
What the hell?

1004
01:13:49,997 --> 01:13:52,399
We gotta get to the shuttle.
Come on.

1005
01:13:56,336 --> 01:13:59,339
You know, my father may not
want to give up the throne.

1006
01:13:59,406 --> 01:14:01,942
No problem.
I'll kill him.

1007
01:14:02,009 --> 01:14:06,013
How dare you?
He's my father. I'll kill him.

1008
01:14:06,814 --> 01:14:11,785
No! You can't!
My work!

1009
01:14:11,985 --> 01:14:16,390
Flies...
I need flies.

1010
01:14:16,457 --> 01:14:19,426
Everything will be lost.

1011
01:14:19,461 --> 01:14:22,396
I have to remember the code.

1012
01:14:22,463 --> 01:14:25,164
Bring me flies.

1013
01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:30,604
No! I must save the ship.
My work!

1014
01:14:41,682 --> 01:14:44,051
Ah the shuttlecraft.

1015
01:14:44,251 --> 01:14:48,055
Fully loaded instrument panel,
and real Corinthian leather.

1016
01:14:54,261 --> 01:14:56,463
What are you doing,
you fool?

1017
01:14:56,530 --> 01:14:58,132
We need that thing
to escape.

1018
01:14:58,265 --> 01:15:02,136
Yes, my queen. But first,
we must find me gold.

1019
01:15:02,269 --> 01:15:06,273
The force field is to make sure
no on leaves without us.

1020
01:15:06,340 --> 01:15:08,876
You ballbusting bitch.

1021
01:15:08,942 --> 01:15:11,078
What did you say?

1022
01:15:11,145 --> 01:15:14,548
Rich... you'll be rich
when we find me gold.

1023
01:15:14,583 --> 01:15:17,184
Help me, so we can get
out of here.

1024
01:15:17,219 --> 01:15:19,119
Locked and bolted.

1025
01:15:30,597 --> 01:15:32,800
- Access denied.
- Shit!

1026
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,401
Is there another way in?

1027
01:15:34,601 --> 01:15:37,137
- What about the ventilation system?
- We're running out of time.

1028
01:15:37,204 --> 01:15:39,139
Somebody's gotta neutralize
that auto-destruct program.

1029
01:15:39,339 --> 01:15:41,106
- Sticks, you're up.
- Talk to me.

1030
01:15:41,141 --> 01:15:43,544
Dr. Mittenhand had a codebook
for the computer.

1031
01:15:43,610 --> 01:15:45,746
I saw Harold with it once.
It has a red cover.

1032
01:15:45,781 --> 01:15:47,780
I'll find it.
Look...

1033
01:15:47,815 --> 01:15:49,016
if there's any reason
I can't crack it...

1034
01:15:49,083 --> 01:15:50,984
- you guys take off without me.
- No.

1035
01:15:51,051 --> 01:15:54,655
We all go together,
or nobody goes at all.

1036
01:15:54,788 --> 01:15:56,590
Right.

1037
01:15:56,657 --> 01:15:59,460
Attention... destruction
of this vessel...

1038
01:15:59,593 --> 01:16:02,463
is in 15 minutes.
This is not a drill.

1039
01:16:03,664 --> 01:16:06,832
I know it's here.
I can smell it.

1040
01:16:06,867 --> 01:16:10,404
We don't have time for this.
We have to get out of here.

1041
01:16:10,471 --> 01:16:13,407
I won't leave without me gold.
You want to go?

1042
01:16:13,474 --> 01:16:15,876
Then go,
I won't stop you.

1043
01:16:16,009 --> 01:16:18,011
But I can't fly the shuttle.

1044
01:16:18,078 --> 01:16:20,614
What a pity.

1045
01:16:20,681 --> 01:16:22,750
Then you're stuck, aren't you?

1046
01:16:22,883 --> 01:16:26,453
You're not the only
wealthy suitor I've had.

1047
01:16:26,488 --> 01:16:29,323
I could marry someone else.

1048
01:16:29,456 --> 01:16:33,260
With a face like that?
I doubt it, my love.

1049
01:16:33,327 --> 01:16:34,928
What are you talking about?

1050
01:16:35,062 --> 01:16:37,865
I could have anyone I want.

1051
01:16:38,065 --> 01:16:39,933
I'm beautiful.

1052
01:16:40,067 --> 01:16:43,070
Not quite, my love.

1053
01:16:43,137 --> 01:16:45,539
You got a tiny
little blemish,

1054
01:16:45,672 --> 01:16:47,474
right about...

1055
01:16:47,541 --> 01:16:48,742
there.

1056
01:16:58,986 --> 01:17:00,387
What the hell?

1057
01:17:08,595 --> 01:17:09,797
All right.

1058
01:17:12,199 --> 01:17:13,200
All right, Sticks.

1059
01:17:13,333 --> 01:17:15,002
Here you go.
Do your thing, baby.

1060
01:17:15,037 --> 01:17:16,537
Come on, now.
Be a hero.

1061
01:17:20,541 --> 01:17:21,809
Red cover.

1062
01:17:29,550 --> 01:17:31,185
What the fuck happened to you?

1063
01:17:36,990 --> 01:17:38,659
What's he done
to the shuttle?

1064
01:17:38,859 --> 01:17:40,861
I don't know.
It's a force field of some kind.

1065
01:17:40,994 --> 01:17:42,463
Touch it, and we fry.

1066
01:17:43,197 --> 01:17:46,467
All personnel, proceed
to Cargo Bay 1...

1067
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:49,069
Let's find that little bastard,
and see if we can't cut a deal.

1068
01:17:54,208 --> 01:17:56,375
Me gold!

1069
01:17:56,410 --> 01:17:59,680
If we don't leave now, we're doomed.
Do you hear me?

1070
01:17:59,813 --> 01:18:02,816
What have they done
to me gold?

1071
01:18:02,883 --> 01:18:04,251
This is it?

1072
01:18:04,384 --> 01:18:06,720
We've spent all this time
searching for pebbles?

1073
01:18:06,854 --> 01:18:09,957
They've shrunk it
down to nothing.

1074
01:18:09,992 --> 01:18:13,060
You're a stupid,
ugly little fool!

1075
01:18:13,260 --> 01:18:15,863
"Ugly," am I?

1076
01:18:15,929 --> 01:18:18,832
Have you looked
in a mirror lately, darlin'?

1077
01:18:18,867 --> 01:18:21,735
Do you know what you
look like, my sweet?

1078
01:18:21,935 --> 01:18:24,538
What are you talking about?
I know what I look like.

1079
01:18:24,671 --> 01:18:27,541
I'm perfect.
I'm breathtaking...

1080
01:18:27,576 --> 01:18:28,742
I'm...

1081
01:18:37,718 --> 01:18:41,121
Oh, shut your cakehole,
you oozing great zit!

1082
01:18:57,805 --> 01:18:59,540
You're fuckin' with
the wrong one now, baby.

1083
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:03,343
All right, here we go.
One step at a time.

1084
01:19:24,398 --> 01:19:26,200
I'll have it all back
the way it was,

1085
01:19:26,266 --> 01:19:28,268
me beautiful
shining gold.

1086
01:19:28,402 --> 01:19:29,403
Hold it!

1087
01:19:30,871 --> 01:19:32,206
You again?

1088
01:19:32,272 --> 01:19:34,608
You don't know
when to give up.

1089
01:19:34,675 --> 01:19:38,812
Attention...
you now have 11 minutes...

1090
01:19:38,847 --> 01:19:40,414
Do you hear that?

1091
01:19:40,614 --> 01:19:42,015
You can keep
your stinking gold,

1092
01:19:42,082 --> 01:19:43,484
and take that bimbo
from hell with you.

1093
01:19:43,584 --> 01:19:46,987
Just show us how to neutralize
the damn auto-destruct mechanism.

1094
01:19:47,187 --> 01:19:49,523
I'll neutralize something for you.

1095
01:20:01,068 --> 01:20:02,536
"Password"?
What damn password?

1096
01:20:05,472 --> 01:20:07,141
Books, Tina,
can you hear me? Come in.

1097
01:20:09,276 --> 01:20:10,944
Books, Tina?

1098
01:20:11,078 --> 01:20:12,711
Sticks, nice of you to call.

1099
01:20:12,746 --> 01:20:15,749
Look, I'm kinda hung up
right now.

1100
01:20:15,883 --> 01:20:16,917
What?

1101
01:20:17,050 --> 01:20:20,854
The computer needs a password.
I can't stop it without a password.

1102
01:20:20,921 --> 01:20:23,123
Tina, we've got to get up there.
He needs a password.

1103
01:20:23,323 --> 01:20:24,925
Maybe we can help him
figure it out.

1104
01:20:25,125 --> 01:20:26,794
Somebody's got
to take him out first.

1105
01:20:31,598 --> 01:20:33,133
- Cover me.
- Tina, no!

1106
01:21:13,807 --> 01:21:15,075
Tina!

1107
01:21:29,390 --> 01:21:31,258
What did you do?

1108
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:32,659
I don't know.

1109
01:21:50,944 --> 01:21:52,946
What did you shoot him with?
Steroids?

1110
01:21:58,252 --> 01:22:00,454
Okay...
We're going to split up.

1111
01:22:00,521 --> 01:22:03,924
Take this, go through that
ventilation shaft, and help Sticks.

1112
01:22:04,124 --> 01:22:05,926
I'm huge!

1113
01:22:07,995 --> 01:22:09,930
I'm magnificent!

1114
01:22:12,132 --> 01:22:13,400
- Go... go.
- Okay.

1115
01:22:17,738 --> 01:22:19,873
All right!

1116
01:22:19,908 --> 01:22:22,009
Big is good.

1117
01:22:41,662 --> 01:22:42,796
Hey!

1118
01:22:45,265 --> 01:22:46,600
You want some of this?

1119
01:22:46,667 --> 01:22:49,870
Ah... "G. I. Squirt. "

1120
01:22:51,672 --> 01:22:53,674
Oh... the pain!

1121
01:22:56,410 --> 01:22:58,078
Oops.

1122
01:23:34,882 --> 01:23:35,549
Oof!

1123
01:24:00,007 --> 01:24:04,545
Total destruction of this vessel
will occur in 7 minutes.

1124
01:24:04,611 --> 01:24:08,415
You should be on board
the shuttlecraft... now.

1125
01:24:09,550 --> 01:24:12,186
Come on, guys!
Hurry up! I need help!

1126
01:24:12,319 --> 01:24:12,920
Hurry up!

1127
01:24:12,986 --> 01:24:15,589
Stop all that lovey-dovey shit
and come on!

1128
01:24:17,391 --> 01:24:20,728
Look, guys...
hurry up! Hurry up!

1129
01:24:20,794 --> 01:24:24,131
I need a password.
I can't stop it without a password.

1130
01:24:25,199 --> 01:24:26,600
Books! Tina!

1131
01:24:34,208 --> 01:24:36,810
So... where are you,
short ass?

1132
01:24:40,013 --> 01:24:42,416
When I find you...

1133
01:24:42,483 --> 01:24:44,451
I'm going to peel you
like a grape.

1134
01:25:04,938 --> 01:25:08,275
Attention...
Five minutes until detonation.

1135
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:15,949
You haven't got long, shorty.

1136
01:25:21,522 --> 01:25:23,323
Sticks?

1137
01:25:23,457 --> 01:25:25,424
Tina, get out of here.
Go back!

1138
01:25:25,459 --> 01:25:27,461
There's a big, ugly
motherfucking spider! Go back!

1139
01:25:28,862 --> 01:25:30,064
What's happening?

1140
01:25:30,130 --> 01:25:31,331
Look out, Tina!

1141
01:25:38,205 --> 01:25:39,606
Feed me!

1142
01:25:57,524 --> 01:25:59,526
I'll get you.

1143
01:26:01,528 --> 01:26:02,796
Feed me!

1144
01:26:13,474 --> 01:26:15,075
Get the fuck away from me!

1145
01:26:20,414 --> 01:26:22,616
Sticks!
Throw me your rifle!

1146
01:26:22,816 --> 01:26:24,750
That damned spider
took my weapon!

1147
01:26:24,785 --> 01:26:27,187
There's some liquid nitrogen
over here in the corner!

1148
01:26:27,254 --> 01:26:28,856
Hit him with that!
Come on!

1149
01:26:28,891 --> 01:26:30,591
Get back! Get back!

1150
01:26:32,259 --> 01:26:33,260
Get him!

1151
01:26:37,464 --> 01:26:38,866
Take that, you bastard!

1152
01:26:48,342 --> 01:26:49,276
Yeah! Yeah!

1153
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:54,948
Now, I'll get you.

1154
01:27:02,656 --> 01:27:04,258
Get him!

1155
01:27:04,324 --> 01:27:07,661
Help me...

1156
01:27:09,463 --> 01:27:10,664
I'm sorry.

1157
01:27:10,864 --> 01:27:12,066
Help me...

1158
01:27:23,544 --> 01:27:27,014
- Are you okay?
- I had a bad dream.

1159
01:27:27,214 --> 01:27:29,983
We gotta get out of here.
Okay? Can you walk?

1160
01:27:31,518 --> 01:27:33,187
Carry me?

1161
01:27:34,121 --> 01:27:37,725
Attention... you have three minutes
to abandon ship.

1162
01:27:38,525 --> 01:27:39,927
- Come on
- Right.

1163
01:27:43,997 --> 01:27:47,735
- Do these belong to you?
- Shut up!

1164
01:27:47,935 --> 01:27:50,871
Guards, spank this one,
and bring him to my chambers.

1165
01:27:54,074 --> 01:27:55,676
...talking about,
"Feed me, feed me. "

1166
01:27:55,876 --> 01:27:57,611
Do I look like
a fly to you?

1167
01:27:57,678 --> 01:27:59,279
Books? What is it?

1168
01:27:59,413 --> 01:28:02,282
Open the outer door
to Cargo Bay 2.

1169
01:28:03,283 --> 01:28:04,451
Books, are you sure?

1170
01:28:04,585 --> 01:28:05,853
Do it now!

1171
01:28:11,258 --> 01:28:12,826
On the left.

1172
01:28:12,861 --> 01:28:14,395
Guess who?

1173
01:28:38,652 --> 01:28:40,120
Now I'll get you.

1174
01:28:42,723 --> 01:28:44,725
My hero...

1175
01:28:56,870 --> 01:28:58,472
Great.

1176
01:29:35,809 --> 01:29:38,612
The king is dead.

1177
01:29:38,679 --> 01:29:41,882
Long live the queen.

1178
01:29:42,082 --> 01:29:44,184
Let's figure this out...

1179
01:29:44,251 --> 01:29:45,052
We can do this.
We can do this...

1180
01:29:45,185 --> 01:29:47,388
Password...

1181
01:29:47,454 --> 01:29:49,590
- Try "Scientist. "
- "Scientist. "

1182
01:29:51,191 --> 01:29:55,462
Attention... you have 60 seconds
to avoid detonation.

1183
01:29:57,598 --> 01:30:00,032
It's gotta be here.

1184
01:30:00,067 --> 01:30:02,603
I don't know, I don't know.
I can't think.

1185
01:30:02,638 --> 01:30:05,806
Thirty seconds
before detonation.

1186
01:30:06,006 --> 01:30:07,674
Books! Yeah, right on!

1187
01:30:07,875 --> 01:30:09,143
- Books!
- So...

1188
01:30:09,343 --> 01:30:10,944
- how are we doing over here?
- Not too good.

1189
01:30:11,078 --> 01:30:13,280
- I can't get it.
- You can get it.

1190
01:30:13,347 --> 01:30:15,349
- It's not working!
- Okay, think... think.

1191
01:30:15,482 --> 01:30:17,117
Relax. Think.

1192
01:30:17,251 --> 01:30:18,519
I don't know shit!

1193
01:30:18,652 --> 01:30:21,121
When we first saw him,
what did he say?

1194
01:30:21,321 --> 01:30:23,257
He was an egomaniac,
who thought he was a genius.

1195
01:30:23,323 --> 01:30:24,658
Right!

1196
01:30:24,725 --> 01:30:26,091
- No.
- Shit!

1197
01:30:26,126 --> 01:30:28,128
"A brilliant scientist. "

1198
01:30:28,262 --> 01:30:30,664
- Wizard!
Five... four...

1199
01:30:30,699 --> 01:30:32,631
three... two...

1200
01:30:32,666 --> 01:30:36,270
One... detona...

1201
01:30:36,470 --> 01:30:38,272
Detonation
has been cancelled.

1202
01:30:38,307 --> 01:30:39,540
Yes!

1203
01:30:39,673 --> 01:30:41,075
Have a nice day.

1204
01:30:41,542 --> 01:30:42,876
Yes!

1205
01:30:46,213 --> 01:30:47,748
Damn!

1206
01:30:47,815 --> 01:30:49,817
I guess I don't get none.

1207
01:30:50,718 --> 01:30:52,119
Check it out.

1208
01:30:52,186 --> 01:30:53,987
Somebody went all to pieces
out there, huh?

1209
01:30:58,926 --> 01:31:00,994
Completely fell apart,
didn't he?

1210
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,936
Same to you, pal.

1211
01:31:09,002 --> 01:31:11,138
Way to go.
Way to work.

1212
01:31:13,140 --> 01:31:15,209
- Now, you're a Marine.
- Thanks.
