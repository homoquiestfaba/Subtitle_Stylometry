If there was a chance of
physically being close to him,

You mind getting Sydney up?

353
00:25:02,984 --> 00:25:04,882
She's actually pretty excited,
thanks to you.

354
00:25:04,884 --> 00:25:07,815
She, uh... she might need
a little help staying focused.

So, we got the results

518
00:38:12,184 --> 00:38:14,615
and it looks like the diazepam

519
00:38:14,617 --> 00:38:16,948
was the most likely cause
of you fainting.

520
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:19,915
Um, sorry, what diazepam?

521
00:38:19,917 --> 00:38:23,182
Well, your blood work showed
a very high amount of it.

522
00:38:23,184 --> 00:38:26,683
That would definitely explain
what happened to you.

523
00:38:28,184 --> 00:38:31,715
There's something else
I wanted to talk to you about,

524
00:38:31,717 --> 00:38:36,084

do it over the phone, so, um...

I know it's a good reason,

00:39:41,051 --> 00:39:45,082
And without me saying
a single word,

539
00:39:45,084 --> 00:39:49,082
he said that I could
never leave him.

540
00:39:49,084 --> 00:39:51,815
That wherever I went,

541
00:39:51,817 --> 00:39:54,948
he would find me.

542
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:58,082
That he would walk
right up to me

543
00:39:58,084 --> 00:40:01,815
and I wouldn't be able
to see him,

544
00:40:01,817 --> 00:40:04,782
but that he would
leave me a sign

545
00:40:04,784 --> 00:40:06,917
so that I'd know he was there.

546
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:19,648
The night I left him,
I drugged him with that.

547
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:22,115
I lost the bottle that night.

548
00:40:22,117 --> 00:40:25,784
And somehow,
it found its way back to me.

549
00:40:27,217 --> 00:40:29,681
So, what exactly
are you saying?

550
00:40:29,683 --> 00:40:32,784
You lost the bottle,
you found the bottle.

551
00:40:35,017 --> 00:40:36,984
He's not dead, Tom.

552
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:43,015
I have a pile of ashes
in the box

553
00:40:43,017 --> 00:40:46,051
that would disagree
with you, Cecilia.

554
00:40:47,384 --> 00:40:49,550

555

556
00:40:55,817 --> 00:40:59,917
He has figured out a way
to be invisible.

557
00:41:04,384 --> 00:41:07,082

in the field of optics.

Adrian was brilliant.

566
00:41:37,784 --> 00:41:39,848
But it wasn't because of
anything he invented.

567
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:42,015
It was how he got
in people's heads.

568
00:41:42,017 --> 00:41:45,518
That was his true genius...
knowing people's weaknesses.

569
00:41:46,683 --> 00:41:48,215
You think about it.

570
00:41:48,217 --> 00:41:52,681
He came up with the perfect way
to torture you even in death.

571
00:41:52,683 --> 00:41:54,182
Only thing more brilliant

572
00:41:54,184 --> 00:41:56,182
than inventing something
that makes you invisible

573
00:41:56,184 --> 00:41:59,051
is not inventing it
but making you think he did.

574

01:40:32,117 --> 01:40:34,715
He set his own brother up.

1260
01:40:34,717 --> 01:40:37,015
I know how this works, Cee.

1261
01:40:37,017 --> 01:40:38,815
I know. You don't understand.

1262
01:40:38,817 --> 01:40:40,082
No, you don't understand.

1263
01:40:40,084 --> 01:40:43,215
This is what he does.

1264
01:40:43,217 --> 01:40:45,984
He makes me feel
like I'm the crazy one.

1265
01:40:48,384 --> 01:40:50,115
This is...

1266
01:40:50,117 --> 01:40:53,982
This is what he does.

1267
01:40:53,984 --> 01:40:55,848
And he's doing it again.

1268
01:40:55,850 --> 01:40:57,015
Okay, okay, but listen.

1269
01:40:57,017 --> 01:40:59,615
I need you to keep that
to yourself

1270
01:40:59,617 --> 01:41:01,782
- and let me do my job.
- (Cecilia sighs)

1271
01:41:01,784 --> 01:41:03,215
Okay?

1272
01:41:03,217 --> 01:41:05,049
Just let me help you.

1273
01:41:05,051 --> 01:41:08,151
Yeah, but as long as Adrian's
around, you can't help me.

1274
01:41:41,650 --> 01:41:43,583
(quiet, shuddering breaths)

1275
01:41:49,184 --> 01:41:51,117
(line ringing)

1276
01:41:56,650 --> 01:41:58,084
ADRIAN (over phone):
Cecilia?

1277
01:42:00,084 --> 01:42:02,583
(sighs)
I'm so glad you called.

1278
01:42:04,750 --> 01:42:06,683
♪ ♪

1279
01:42:21,384 --> 01:42:24,051
(wind whistling)

1280
01:42:41,151 --> 01:42:43,915
Well... (chuckles)

1281
01:42:43,917 --> 01:42:46,382
You look amazing.

1282
01:42:46,384 --> 01:42:50,115
I mean, you-you've always...
you always look amazing.

1283
01:42:50,117 --> 01:42:52,948
I don't feel amazing.

1284
01:42:52,950 --> 01:42:54,784
It's all a lie.

1285
01:42:55,884 --> 01:42:58,149
Please, come on in.

1286
01:42:58,151 --> 01:43:00,084
It's cold. Come on.

1287
01:43:18,117 --> 01:43:19,950
(Adrian clears throat)

1288
01:43:23,917 --> 01:43:26,982
So, I-I wanted to get us some
simple takeout, but, of course,

1289
01:43:26,984 --> 01:43:29,648
I-I started obsessing over what
you'd be in the mood for.

1290
01:43:29,650 --> 01:43:32,683
Hence, we have the OCD buffet
of sushi, steak and pasta.

1291
01:43:34,950 --> 01:43:37,082
Or you might not
be hungry at all.

1292
01:43:37,084 --> 01:43:39,182
Uh... which is so logical

1293
01:43:39,184 --> 01:43:42,182
that it suddenly makes
this feast look moronic.

1294
01:43:42,184 --> 01:43:43,915
CECILIA:
I'll have steak.

1295
01:43:43,917 --> 01:43:45,182
That's a good choice.

1296
01:43:45,184 --> 01:43:47,117
(no audio)

1297
01:43:53,884 --> 01:43:56,082
(chuckles, clears throat)

1298
01:43:56,084 --> 01:43:58,948
My hand's shaking.
(chuckles)

1299
01:43:58,950 --> 01:44:01,681
Uh... (clears throat)

1300
01:44:01,683 --> 01:44:03,750
(takes deep breath)

1301
01:44:06,184 --> 01:44:08,615
You know, you're the only
person in the world

1302
01:44:08,617 --> 01:44:11,117
who gets to see my hand shake.

1303
01:44:12,683 --> 01:44:15,051
It's 'cause I need you,
Cecilia.

1304
01:44:16,384 --> 01:44:19,082
I know I didn't
treat you the way

1305
01:44:19,084 --> 01:44:22,948
you should have been treated
when we were together.

1306
01:44:22,950 --> 01:44:25,817
But I've learned my lesson.

1307
01:44:28,884 --> 01:44:33,817
I would burn everything I own
just to prove that to you.

1308
01:44:38,084 --> 01:44:39,750
Okay.

1309
01:44:41,850 --> 01:44:43,583
Okay.

1310
01:44:45,650 --> 01:44:49,984
If you want to be a part
of this child's life...

1311
01:44:52,650 --> 01:44:55,115
...it has to start
with honesty.

1312
01:44:55,117 --> 01:44:56,950
Of course.

1313
01:45:02,650 --> 01:45:07,017
Which means I need you to admit
everything that you did.

1314
01:45:11,084 --> 01:45:14,182
That it was you,

1315
01:45:14,184 --> 01:45:16,151
not your brother.

1316
01:45:18,384 --> 01:45:20,149
You.

1317
01:45:20,151 --> 01:45:22,082
(shuddering chuckle)

1318
01:45:22,084 --> 01:45:24,717
Cecilia.

1319
01:45:27,850 --> 01:45:29,948
I loved my brother.

1320
01:45:29,950 --> 01:45:31,784
And I thought he loved me, too.

1321
01:45:35,117 --> 01:45:38,850
I know it didn't seem like it
to the outside world, but...

1322
01:45:41,617 --> 01:45:43,583
Tom controlled me.

1323
01:45:45,683 --> 01:45:47,815
(trembling):
Just tell me the truth.

1324
01:45:47,817 --> 01:45:52,017
I need to know
that I'm not crazy, okay?

1325
01:45:56,784 --> 01:45:59,815
And we can't start this
with a lie.

1326
01:45:59,817 --> 01:46:01,884
But I'm not
starting with a lie.

1327
01:46:05,084 --> 01:46:07,215
It wasn't me.

1328
01:46:07,217 --> 01:46:09,215
I swear it.

1329
01:46:09,217 --> 01:46:12,015
Why can't you just
tell me the truth?

1330
01:46:12,017 --> 01:46:14,681
I am.

1331
01:46:14,683 --> 01:46:15,884
Adrian, stop.

1332
01:46:19,917 --> 01:46:23,650
I need you to do this for me.

1333
01:46:25,750 --> 01:46:27,049
(over headphones):
More than that,

1334
01:46:27,051 --> 01:46:28,984
do it for you, Adrian.

1335
01:46:31,051 --> 01:46:32,882
ADRIAN:
I'm giving you exactly

1336
01:46:32,884 --> 01:46:34,950
what you're asking for,
Cecilia.

1337
01:46:36,650 --> 01:46:40,750
I am telling you the truth.

1338
01:46:46,717 --> 01:46:49,782
- Oh.
- (Cecilia crying)

1339
01:46:49,784 --> 01:46:52,051
Oh, no, no, no.

1340
01:46:56,984 --> 01:47:01,015
I know that you feel like
you're going insane sometimes.

1341
01:47:01,017 --> 01:47:04,082
But I'm the only one
who can help you.

1342
01:47:04,084 --> 01:47:06,648
Remember?

1343
01:47:06,650 --> 01:47:09,917
Because I know you better
than anyone else in the world.

1344
01:47:12,084 --> 01:47:14,082
I mean... (chuckles)

1345
01:47:14,084 --> 01:47:17,215
that shouldn't come as a...

1346
01:47:17,217 --> 01:47:19,683
surprise.

1347
01:47:26,950 --> 01:47:28,950
(chuckles softly, shudders)

1348
01:47:36,984 --> 01:47:39,215
I should go clean myself up.

1349
01:47:39,217 --> 01:47:40,850
(chuckles) Of course.

1350
01:47:54,817 --> 01:47:56,850

No! No, no.

1361
01:49:05,984 --> 01:49:10,648
(sobbing, over headphones):
No, no. What did you do?

1362
01:49:10,650 --> 01:49:12,015
OPERATOR: 9-1-1,
what is your emergency?

1363
01:49:12,017 --> 01:49:13,915
Please, please,
you have to help me, please.

1364
01:49:13,917 --> 01:49:15,782
I'm with somebody,
and I think he's...

1365
01:49:15,784 --> 01:49:17,648
he's tried to kill himself.

1366
01:49:17,650 --> 01:49:18,884
Hurry. You have to help.

1367
01:49:23,151 --> 01:49:26,648
You have to hurry. Please.

1368
01:49:26,650 --> 01:49:31,882
It's, uh, 3333 Celestial Drive.

1369

1370
01:49:34,617 --> 01:49:36,650
Please.

(groaning weakly)

1372
01:49:54,950 --> 01:49:56,817
Surprise.

1378
01:50:23,850 --> 01:50:25,382
JAMES:
Hey, hey.

1379
01:50:25,384 --> 01:50:26,848
- Hey. You okay?
- It's okay.

1380
01:50:26,850 --> 01:50:28,215
- You okay? What...
- I'm okay. I'm okay.

1381
01:50:28,217 --> 01:50:30,550
James, look at me. I'm okay.

1382
01:50:31,917 --> 01:50:33,617
He killed himself.

1383
01:50:36,650 --> 01:50:39,082
He cut his own throat.

1384
01:50:39,084 --> 01:50:41,084
There's security camera
video of it.

(soft, rapid clicking)

1386
01:50:54,084 --> 01:50:55,848
You never did want to get him

1387
01:50:55,850 --> 01:50:58,382
admitting anything
on tape, did you?

1388
01:50:58,384 --> 01:51:00,084
Of course I did.

1389
01:51:01,784 --> 01:51:04,151
I just didn't know
he was that unstable.

1390
01:51:11,750 --> 01:51:14,182
You heard it, right?

1391
01:51:14,184 --> 01:51:16,084
James?

1392
01:51:18,617 --> 01:51:21,084
What'd it sound like to you?

1393
01:51:29,051 --> 01:51:32,648
It sounded a lot like
he killed himself.
