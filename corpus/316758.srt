1
00:01:09,247 --> 00:01:11,238
Please take notes.

2
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:15,542
No wounds on the body to indicate
foul play from a weapon of any sort.

3
00:01:15,721 --> 00:01:20,317
The contents of the safe are intact,
thus ruling out robbery as a motive.

4
00:01:20,492 --> 00:01:22,687
The science of fingerprinting
has determined...

5
00:01:22,861 --> 00:01:25,887
...there are no prints but the victim's
on the doorknob and frame...

6
00:01:26,064 --> 00:01:28,157
...to indicate anyone else
entered or left.

7
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:30,528
The window is latched shut
from the inside.

8
00:01:30,702 --> 00:01:32,636
So no one entered or left by that route...

9
00:01:32,804 --> 00:01:35,068
...thus ruling out homicide
as a cause of death.

10
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,006
There's no indication of whiskey in
the glass or on the breath of the deceased.

11
00:01:39,177 --> 00:01:41,202
No carpet fibers
on the soles of her shoes.

12
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:45,009
So she never set foot on the carpet.
There is a scuff on her right shoe tip...

13
00:01:45,183 --> 00:01:46,480
...where polish was removed.

14
00:01:46,652 --> 00:01:50,088
There is traces of the same polish
on this upturned bit of carpet.

15
00:01:50,255 --> 00:01:54,817
There are traces of flower pollen
on the edges of the nostril.

16
00:01:55,894 --> 00:01:59,455
I therefore conclude
from the evidence gathered...

17
00:01:59,898 --> 00:02:02,765
...that the deceased entered the room
with a bunch of flowers.

18
00:02:02,934 --> 00:02:05,164
She placed the flowers
in the vase by the door.

19
00:02:05,337 --> 00:02:08,864
She took the vase in one hand, along
with the whiskey tumbler in the other...

20
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:11,407
...went across the room
to the decanter of whiskey...

21
00:02:11,576 --> 00:02:13,567
...let the flowers get too close
to her nose.

22
00:02:13,745 --> 00:02:16,407
She sneezed, her left foot
involuntarily slipped forward...

23
00:02:16,581 --> 00:02:18,640
...caught the tip of her shoe
on this carpet...

24
00:02:18,817 --> 00:02:22,082
...tripped, hit her head on the floor,
died from shock of the brain.

25
00:02:22,254 --> 00:02:25,485
In other words, it was not foul play
that killed this poor woman...

26
00:02:25,657 --> 00:02:29,525
...but an accident
caused by a simple sneeze.

27
00:02:30,228 --> 00:02:32,788
And, in fact, it is not a woman at all...

28
00:02:32,964 --> 00:02:37,765
...but a man wearing a horse-haired wig.

29
00:02:56,888 --> 00:02:58,719
Oh, Quentin, I'm so proud.

30
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:01,916
- You know what this means, Clarissa?
- Yes, that we can get married.

31
00:03:02,094 --> 00:03:04,392
It means science has a place
in police work.

32
00:03:05,731 --> 00:03:09,929
I proved it. I convinced
each and every one of them.

33
00:03:10,102 --> 00:03:12,502
Now there's only one more person
you have to convince.

34
00:03:12,771 --> 00:03:15,706
I'm convinced.
But you must remember, Mr. Jackson...

35
00:03:15,874 --> 00:03:18,434
...if we don't own the land
within 90 days...

36
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:22,740
...the railroad will go to other banks
to finance their expansion.

37
00:03:22,914 --> 00:03:24,848
No worries, Mr. Ashe.

38
00:03:25,016 --> 00:03:28,782
In 90 days, we'll be laying track
right through the middle of Mexico City.

39
00:03:41,366 --> 00:03:42,765
Go.

40
00:03:43,502 --> 00:03:44,628
That's a good one.

41
00:03:48,673 --> 00:03:49,799
You do better.

42
00:03:49,975 --> 00:03:52,535
How could you sell the mortgage
on my farm to the gringos?

43
00:03:52,711 --> 00:03:55,305
Pedro, we have no choice.

44
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,778
The big American banks
control the cash flow.

45
00:03:57,949 --> 00:03:59,974
And through the cash flow,
they control us.

46
00:04:00,152 --> 00:04:01,449
Don Diego's doing all he can.

47
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,781
I'm sure Don Diego is.

48
00:04:03,955 --> 00:04:08,585
But I've worked my whole life
to leave something to my poor daughter.

49
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,558
All she knows is the farm life.

50
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:13,295
What will become of her?

51
00:04:26,578 --> 00:04:28,910
You cheated. I wasn't concentrating.

52
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,449
Best of three.

53
00:04:42,994 --> 00:04:46,088
- Let me talk to Bernardo.
- Bernardo just follows orders.

54
00:04:46,932 --> 00:04:50,595
So, what are we supposed to do, Papa,
stand by and let them steal our land?

55
00:04:50,769 --> 00:04:54,535
Unless some higher authority
intercedes...

56
00:04:55,874 --> 00:04:57,535
Maria, where are you going?

57
00:04:57,709 --> 00:04:59,040
To see the higher authority.

58
00:05:30,242 --> 00:05:32,233
Up. Up.

59
00:05:49,227 --> 00:05:52,287
The spitting image of her mother,
God rest her soul.

60
00:05:52,464 --> 00:05:54,489
My condolences, Don Diego.

61
00:05:54,799 --> 00:05:56,266
Twenty years she's gone now.

62
00:05:56,434 --> 00:05:58,527
Well, she left you
a very beautiful daughter.

63
00:05:58,703 --> 00:06:02,662
Who I haven't seen in most of the 10 years
she's been away at school in Europe.

64
00:06:03,308 --> 00:06:06,607
- Left a girl, came home a woman.
- Indeed.

65
00:06:07,712 --> 00:06:10,738
My only problem now
is trying to convince her to stay.

66
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:13,680
She's been home for a week,
and already she wants to go back.

67
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,188
- I want to see Don Diego.
- He can't be disturbed.

68
00:06:21,359 --> 00:06:23,554
Neither can I. And I am.
Very disturbed.

69
00:06:23,728 --> 00:06:26,196
He is meeting
with a very important person.

70
00:06:26,364 --> 00:06:29,561
Don Diego has always said,
"Every client is a very important person."

71
00:06:29,734 --> 00:06:32,202
This is not a client, Maria.

72
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:35,134
This is a gentleman
from The Bank of New York.

73
00:06:36,007 --> 00:06:37,872
I knew it.

74
00:06:42,447 --> 00:06:43,675
Gotta pay the toll.

75
00:06:58,296 --> 00:07:01,629
May I present Mr. Jackson from
the Capital Bank and Trust of Nueva York.

76
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,062
How do you do, Mr. Jackson?

77
00:07:03,234 --> 00:07:07,295
Infinitely better in your presence
than I do out of it, Señorita Sandoval.

78
00:07:09,307 --> 00:07:10,740
Afternoon tea. How civilized.

79
00:07:10,909 --> 00:07:13,707
Are you surprised to find
that we are civilized, Mr. Jackson?

80
00:07:13,878 --> 00:07:15,470
No, not at all.

81
00:07:15,647 --> 00:07:17,444
No, I find it charming.

82
00:07:17,615 --> 00:07:18,980
Charming?

83
00:07:19,217 --> 00:07:21,048
I presume if you are using
such a word...

84
00:07:21,219 --> 00:07:25,178
...that you've never experienced
the pleasure of an afternoon tea.

85
00:07:25,357 --> 00:07:28,224
Mr. Jackson's bank has agreed
to provide us...

86
00:07:28,393 --> 00:07:31,294
...with the capital we need
to continue with what we are doing.

87
00:07:31,529 --> 00:07:33,963
We were just going over the papers.

88
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,794
A big New York bank taking an interest
in our small Mexican bank?

89
00:07:40,138 --> 00:07:42,129
Why is that, Mr. Jackson?

90
00:07:42,307 --> 00:07:45,743
Well, if you can't help friends
in a time of need, who can you help?

91
00:07:46,211 --> 00:07:48,941
Pardon me, but in Europe
we have a different perspective...

92
00:07:49,114 --> 00:07:51,275
...on the American definition
of friendship.

93
00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:54,350
Forgive my ignorance, señorita,
but I'm a little uninformed...

94
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:56,282
...on the European perspective.

95
00:07:56,454 --> 00:08:00,151
But I'm always willing to learn.
In fact, I'd be delighted...

96
00:08:00,325 --> 00:08:03,351
...if you would enlighten me
on that subject, perhaps over dinner?

97
00:08:03,528 --> 00:08:05,655
Perhaps some other time.
I need to get up early.

98
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,058
I have a long ride tomorrow.

99
00:08:07,232 --> 00:08:08,631
Checkmate.

100
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,268
Goodbye, Mr. Jackson.

101
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:19,901
Men. All they have is one thing
on their minds.

102
00:08:20,078 --> 00:08:22,205
And, by the way, that includes you.

103
00:08:22,647 --> 00:08:26,242
Please. I've seen how you look
at that little filly of Señor Gomez.

104
00:08:26,418 --> 00:08:27,885
A little more.

105
00:08:28,153 --> 00:08:29,848
A little more.

106
00:08:45,937 --> 00:08:47,234
Stay here.

107
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,736
Don't talk to anybody.

108
00:09:18,903 --> 00:09:19,995
Excuse me.

109
00:09:20,171 --> 00:09:21,934
Excuse me.

110
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,437
What was that?
Is there a problem?

111
00:09:24,776 --> 00:09:26,038
For me? No.

112
00:09:26,211 --> 00:09:28,179
For the horse
that gets poked in the side...

113
00:09:28,346 --> 00:09:30,837
...with metal every time
you want him to do something...

114
00:09:31,015 --> 00:09:32,983
...for him, I'm sure it's a problem.

115
00:09:33,852 --> 00:09:36,286
Of course, he's probably
too polite to say anything.

116
00:09:36,454 --> 00:09:38,820
Well, certainly more polite than you.

117
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:42,187
But, anyway, thank you for your opinion,
misinformed as it is.

118
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,760
Perhaps you can tell me
what you're doing in my house.

119
00:09:44,929 --> 00:09:46,157
Oh, so you are the daughter.

120
00:09:46,331 --> 00:09:49,391
- Yes, I am the daughter. And you are?
- Maria Alvarez.

121
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:52,968
- Do you work for us, Maria Alvarez?
- No, I do not work for you.

122
00:09:53,138 --> 00:09:56,073
- Then what are you doing here?
- I have business with your father.

123
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:01,841
- And what sort of business, may I ask?
- Private business.

124
00:10:02,413 --> 00:10:03,402
Hey.

125
00:10:04,716 --> 00:10:06,684
Hey, stop. Hey.

126
00:10:07,785 --> 00:10:09,184
Maria.

127
00:10:09,354 --> 00:10:10,912
Maria.

128
00:10:23,001 --> 00:10:24,229
I knew it.

129
00:10:24,402 --> 00:10:28,031
You help the gringos steal our land.
You betray your own people.

130
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,939
How dare you accuse me.

131
00:10:30,108 --> 00:10:31,871
Get her out of here.
Have her arrested.

132
00:10:32,043 --> 00:10:35,410
Traitor. Thief.
You're gonna pay for this.

133
00:10:36,281 --> 00:10:37,270
I'm sorry.

134
00:10:37,448 --> 00:10:39,678
They are stealing our land.

135
00:10:39,851 --> 00:10:41,512
Don Diego is a traitor.

136
00:10:42,687 --> 00:10:45,349
Don Diego is a traitor.

137
00:10:49,093 --> 00:10:51,687
- The future.
- To the future.

138
00:11:06,411 --> 00:11:07,400
Are you lost?

139
00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:09,303
Mr. Alvarez, Pedro...

140
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,313
...you're delinquent
in your loan payments.

141
00:11:12,483 --> 00:11:16,044
How can I pay when the interest
is more than I earn?

142
00:11:16,221 --> 00:11:18,655
Says in this agreement
that if you're in arrears...

143
00:11:19,057 --> 00:11:23,426
...we have the right to foreclose
and purchase this property for one peso.

144
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:29,464
Over my dead body.

145
00:11:29,634 --> 00:11:30,896
No problem.

146
00:11:37,909 --> 00:11:41,470
There's your receipt, Mr. Alvarez, Pedro.

147
00:11:42,146 --> 00:11:43,636
Burn it.

148
00:11:55,526 --> 00:11:57,858
You should have locked them up,
not me.

149
00:11:58,596 --> 00:12:02,157
- They did not break into someone's house.
- No, they are doing worse.

150
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:05,530
You want my advice, Maria?
You should stop trying to change the world.

151
00:12:05,703 --> 00:12:10,606
You want my advice, Gustavo?
You should start trying to change the world.

152
00:12:13,011 --> 00:12:14,308
Eat.

153
00:12:20,685 --> 00:12:23,381
The poultice that will help
your horse's hoof.

154
00:12:24,656 --> 00:12:25,884
Thank you.

155
00:12:27,859 --> 00:12:30,521
Now who's gonna be outside?

156
00:12:33,498 --> 00:12:35,022
Keep an eye on her.

157
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:41,969
- What are you doing here?
- Hey, old man, read this.

158
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,301
- What's this?
- This is for you.

159
00:12:44,475 --> 00:12:46,841
You haven't been making
your payments to the bank.

160
00:12:47,011 --> 00:12:48,808
We have a right to foreclose.

161
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:52,746
I've given you everything you're gonna
get from me. Now get out.

162
00:13:32,156 --> 00:13:35,091
Papa? Papa?

163
00:13:36,227 --> 00:13:37,854
Papa.

164
00:13:40,565 --> 00:13:41,862
Maria.

165
00:14:00,385 --> 00:14:03,115
Papa. Papa?

166
00:14:03,354 --> 00:14:04,514
Papa?

167
00:14:04,689 --> 00:14:07,556
Somebody, please go get a doctor.

168
00:14:07,725 --> 00:14:10,421
- What did you do to him?
- I didn't do anything.

169
00:14:10,595 --> 00:14:14,031
- We were finishing the arrangements...
- You killed him.

170
00:14:14,198 --> 00:14:15,790
You killed my father.

171
00:14:15,967 --> 00:14:18,265
Señorita,
he's evidently had a heart attack.

172
00:14:18,436 --> 00:14:19,767
No.

173
00:14:19,937 --> 00:14:21,165
He was...

174
00:14:21,339 --> 00:14:23,307
He was healthy.

175
00:14:23,474 --> 00:14:26,272
You did something to him.
I know you did.

176
00:14:26,477 --> 00:14:31,676
I know this is a terrible shock for you,
but you need to try and remain calm.

177
00:14:31,849 --> 00:14:33,817
In fact, I think you need to sit down.

178
00:14:35,119 --> 00:14:36,916
Grief is intense, I understand that.

179
00:14:37,088 --> 00:14:39,921
But if you can,
let's review the situation calmly.

180
00:14:40,491 --> 00:14:43,392
Your father's dead. Everything that
belonged to him is now mine.

181
00:14:43,561 --> 00:14:46,359
In your mistaken belief
that I had something to do with it...

182
00:14:46,531 --> 00:14:48,658
...you've attacked me.
You're trying to kill me.

183
00:14:49,233 --> 00:14:51,428
My natural reaction is self-defense.

184
00:14:51,602 --> 00:14:53,763
Before we can stop this,
I'll shoot you dead.

185
00:14:54,338 --> 00:14:56,772
But it doesn't have to end that way.

186
00:14:59,577 --> 00:15:01,101
Look at that, darling.

187
00:15:02,146 --> 00:15:04,011
It's choosing time.

188
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:15,119
That's it.

189
00:15:19,764 --> 00:15:22,028
Well, I guess we've got a deal.

190
00:15:23,201 --> 00:15:26,534
If you don't mind,
I need to go to my room.

191
00:15:26,971 --> 00:15:28,962
I must lie down.

192
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:32,803
This is all too much for me at once.
You understand?

193
00:15:34,579 --> 00:15:36,103
Yes.

194
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,407
Absolutely.

195
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,278
I understand.

196
00:15:43,221 --> 00:15:45,018
You take all the time you need.

197
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,720
Don't worry about a thing.

198
00:15:52,597 --> 00:15:54,656
I'll make all the arrangements.

199
00:16:05,276 --> 00:16:06,834
Oh, darling?

200
00:16:08,346 --> 00:16:11,179
Would you like your afternoon tea...

201
00:16:11,349 --> 00:16:13,613
...sent up to your room?

202
00:16:16,387 --> 00:16:19,117
That would be very nice. Thank you.

203
00:16:40,111 --> 00:16:42,102
- Hey. Hey.
- Get back here.

204
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,804
Come back here, you bitch.

205
00:16:44,882 --> 00:16:46,850
- Come back.
- Hey. Come here.

206
00:16:53,224 --> 00:16:54,384
I got you now.

207
00:17:30,161 --> 00:17:31,958
Goddamn it.

208
00:17:54,685 --> 00:17:56,949
- Padre.
- Maria?

209
00:17:59,223 --> 00:18:00,622
They shot him.

210
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:04,192
I know, my child. I know.

211
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:27,608
What do you want from me, huh?

212
00:18:27,785 --> 00:18:30,151
I have nothing to give you. Nothing.

213
00:18:31,088 --> 00:18:33,955
You should have eaten
while you had the chance.

214
00:19:16,901 --> 00:19:18,596
Get out of here. Shoo.

215
00:19:44,395 --> 00:19:46,454
Hands up.

216
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:47,892
No one...

217
00:19:48,365 --> 00:19:49,662
Move.

218
00:19:58,175 --> 00:20:00,040
What are you doing?

219
00:20:00,878 --> 00:20:03,904
What do you think I'm doing?
I'm taking this bank.

220
00:20:04,915 --> 00:20:06,940
- With an unloaded gun?
- How do you know?

221
00:20:07,151 --> 00:20:08,982
When a gun doesn't have any bullets...

222
00:20:09,153 --> 00:20:12,088
Doesn't matter.
This bank is taken. Find another one.

223
00:20:12,256 --> 00:20:15,054
This is the only bank in town.
Besides, it's my father's.

224
00:20:15,226 --> 00:20:16,955
And take that raggedy mask off.

225
00:20:17,128 --> 00:20:19,562
It doesn't even match.
Everyone knows who you are.

226
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:22,255
Your mask isn't silly?
People won't recognize that voice?

227
00:20:22,433 --> 00:20:24,731
- "This is my father's bank."
- It is my father's.

228
00:20:24,902 --> 00:20:26,767
Get out of my way.
I need to finish my job.

229
00:20:26,937 --> 00:20:30,338
- Señoritas?
- I would hardly call stealing a job.

230
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:32,668
Señoritas?

231
00:20:32,843 --> 00:20:34,640
I am not stealing.

232
00:20:34,812 --> 00:20:37,542
I am taking it back from the bastards
who murdered my father.

233
00:20:37,982 --> 00:20:40,007
- They killed Don Diego?
- Señoritas.

234
00:20:40,184 --> 00:20:41,617
What?

235
00:20:41,786 --> 00:20:44,516
The first order of business
is that we're gonna secure...

236
00:20:44,688 --> 00:20:46,553
...and then remove all the deposits.

237
00:20:46,724 --> 00:20:49,352
And then we're gonna instill
some renewed confidence in it.

238
00:20:49,527 --> 00:20:52,325
I'd like to see the Stars and Stripes
flying over this place...

239
00:20:52,496 --> 00:20:55,624
...so things start to look
a little more American down here.

240
00:20:58,402 --> 00:21:00,267
Señor Manager?

241
00:21:01,138 --> 00:21:03,538
This establishment is now
a wholly-owned subsidiary...

242
00:21:03,707 --> 00:21:06,267
...of the Capital Bank and Trust
of New York.

243
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:08,134
What do you say we open the vault?

244
00:21:08,579 --> 00:21:12,879
Take a look, and see what kind of cash
is on hand in the liquid-assets department.

245
00:21:14,218 --> 00:21:16,311
Excuse me. Where is the vault?

246
00:21:17,922 --> 00:21:19,184
In Don Diego's office.

247
00:21:19,356 --> 00:21:23,292
Well, I guess that would be Señor Jackson's
office now, wouldn't it?

248
00:21:36,307 --> 00:21:37,899
We did it. We did it.

249
00:21:38,209 --> 00:21:40,404
We did it. We did it.

250
00:21:43,914 --> 00:21:46,348
- We did it.
- And what is it that you think you did?

251
00:21:46,517 --> 00:21:48,849
Look. We're gonna help a lot of people.

252
00:21:49,019 --> 00:21:50,111
To really help...

253
00:21:50,287 --> 00:21:53,688
...you'd have to reverse the massive theft
of property that has taken place.

254
00:21:54,091 --> 00:21:58,027
Listen, do you know how many
kilos of rice we can buy with this?

255
00:21:58,195 --> 00:22:00,720
We can feed 500 people.

256
00:22:04,201 --> 00:22:05,600
Why were you robbing the bank?

257
00:22:06,237 --> 00:22:07,465
Revenge.

258
00:22:07,638 --> 00:22:09,367
Not to help the people?

259
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,235
No.

260
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,608
What?

261
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:21,743
Stop looking at me that way,
both of you.

262
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,716
My life is not here.

263
00:22:24,588 --> 00:22:26,579
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like?

264
00:22:26,757 --> 00:22:30,090
Taking the money.
I'm going back to Europe.

265
00:22:30,261 --> 00:22:31,592
You're joking.

266
00:22:31,762 --> 00:22:33,855
All right, you can take half. I don't care.

267
00:22:34,031 --> 00:22:36,056
You can even keep the dog as a bonus.

268
00:22:38,936 --> 00:22:40,563
If you want to go, go.

269
00:22:40,738 --> 00:22:42,797
But the money stays. All of it.

270
00:22:42,973 --> 00:22:44,770
- No, it doesn't.
- Yes, it does.

271
00:22:44,942 --> 00:22:46,569
No, it doesn't.

272
00:23:58,882 --> 00:24:02,978
We were just debating
the basic economic theories...

273
00:24:03,153 --> 00:24:05,314
...of wealth distribution.

274
00:24:05,489 --> 00:24:07,821
Yes. Yes, we were.

275
00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:09,717
That's good.

276
00:24:09,893 --> 00:24:12,862
But before you reach
any hasty conclusions...

277
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:14,725
...let me show you something.

278
00:25:07,484 --> 00:25:08,883
What?

279
00:25:09,053 --> 00:25:11,544
Rice and beans
are not good enough for you?

280
00:25:11,722 --> 00:25:15,158
I just can't eat when I see
what has been done to these people.

281
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:16,890
At least tonight they can eat.

282
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:22,622
We have to find a way
to get them back on their land.

283
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,597
We must come up with a plan.

284
00:25:24,768 --> 00:25:26,599
Something that will benefit the people...

285
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:29,034
...and destroy these murderers.

286
00:25:31,575 --> 00:25:33,839
I think we should rob more banks.

287
00:25:34,011 --> 00:25:35,535
Yeah.

288
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:44,046
Let's go.

289
00:25:44,588 --> 00:25:46,681
- Let's go where?
- Let's go rob more banks.

290
00:25:47,624 --> 00:25:50,991
We can't just go right now
and rob a bank.

291
00:25:51,762 --> 00:25:53,093
Fine. Finish brushing.

292
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:55,964
That's not it. We're not ready.

293
00:25:56,533 --> 00:25:58,592
- Yes, we are. We just did it.
- We were lucky.

294
00:25:58,769 --> 00:26:01,966
We cannot rely on luck.
We need to think first.

295
00:26:02,139 --> 00:26:06,200
We need to consider the implications,
the consequences.

296
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:09,270
- Why are you so complicated?
- Why are you so unrealistic?

297
00:26:09,613 --> 00:26:14,949
This is a noble cause
you seek to undertake, señoritas.

298
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:19,681
But if you keep fighting like cats and dogs,
you won't make it to sunrise.

299
00:26:21,291 --> 00:26:24,624
My daughters, you know...

300
00:26:25,028 --> 00:26:29,021
...when Columbus proposed his journey
to discover the New World...

301
00:26:29,199 --> 00:26:31,497
...everybody said that was...

302
00:26:31,668 --> 00:26:33,192
...unrealistic.

303
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:34,803
But he succeeded.

304
00:26:34,972 --> 00:26:38,169
Because he had the king and queen
of Spain to help him.

305
00:26:38,342 --> 00:26:40,833
Who do we have to help us?

306
00:26:41,111 --> 00:26:45,445
I think I might know someone
who can help you.

307
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,787
Can I help you?

308
00:26:51,955 --> 00:26:53,422
We're looking for these two.

309
00:26:54,358 --> 00:26:57,384
What's a pair of señoritas like that
gonna be doing way out here?

310
00:26:57,561 --> 00:27:00,553
We found this snagged on a cactus
half mile down the road.

311
00:27:00,731 --> 00:27:04,167
Well, you find any more of that,
you can make yourself a nice little hankie.

312
00:27:05,102 --> 00:27:07,332
Now, do you mind getting your foot
out of my door?

313
00:27:07,804 --> 00:27:10,204
- And if I don't?
- Lf you don't, I'll kill you.

314
00:27:10,374 --> 00:27:12,365
Now get your sorry ass off this porch.

315
00:27:12,843 --> 00:27:14,470
You too.

316
00:27:18,715 --> 00:27:20,012
Come on.

317
00:27:35,532 --> 00:27:37,625
Hey, does this belong to you?

318
00:27:37,801 --> 00:27:39,029
Thank you.

319
00:27:39,203 --> 00:27:40,636
Excuse me.

320
00:27:40,904 --> 00:27:42,098
Mr...

321
00:27:44,675 --> 00:27:46,768
- Where are you going?
- Far from here.

322
00:27:46,944 --> 00:27:49,970
Toughs like that tend to come back
with reinforcements.

323
00:27:50,147 --> 00:27:52,980
- But you said you would help us.
- I just did, missy.

324
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:55,948
No, no. Padre Pablo said
you could teach us to rob banks.

325
00:27:56,119 --> 00:27:57,586
Well, where did he get that idea?

326
00:27:57,754 --> 00:27:59,312
He said that's what you used to do.

327
00:27:59,489 --> 00:28:02,390
That you robbed 37 banks in Texas
and never got caught.

328
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,460
Thirty-seven.
Last time I go to confession.

329
00:28:05,629 --> 00:28:09,895
Listen, high-minded ideals is one thing,
robbing banks is another.

330
00:28:10,067 --> 00:28:13,002
And to tell you the truth,
neither one of you pass the muster.

331
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:16,970
- We're well aware of that. At least I am.
- That's why we came to you.

332
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,471
To learn.

333
00:28:18,642 --> 00:28:20,473
Well, to learn, you gotta have resources.

334
00:28:20,644 --> 00:28:22,441
So far the only thing you've shown me...

335
00:28:22,613 --> 00:28:25,309
...is a talent for bringing trouble
to my front door.

336
00:28:25,482 --> 00:28:26,744
Buena suerte, ladies.

337
00:28:29,786 --> 00:28:31,845
Mr. Buck.

338
00:28:34,091 --> 00:28:35,319
You're not going anywhere...

339
00:28:35,492 --> 00:28:37,983
...until you tell us
everything we need to know.

340
00:28:38,295 --> 00:28:40,286
First, if you pull the trigger
on that gun...

341
00:28:40,464 --> 00:28:42,864
...the way you're pointed,
you might cause it to rain.

342
00:28:43,033 --> 00:28:45,695
- Well, haven't you fired a pistol before?
- I have.

343
00:28:45,869 --> 00:28:47,268
But you didn't kill anybody.

344
00:28:47,437 --> 00:28:48,699
There's always a first time.

345
00:28:48,872 --> 00:28:50,601
That's true. But this ain't it.

346
00:28:55,212 --> 00:28:56,873
Hey.

347
00:28:59,716 --> 00:29:01,445
What are you doing?

348
00:29:04,554 --> 00:29:06,283
Come on. Go on.

349
00:29:06,657 --> 00:29:08,716
What the heck? Go on.

350
00:29:18,902 --> 00:29:20,426
Git.

351
00:29:22,205 --> 00:29:23,604
Go, git.

352
00:29:24,474 --> 00:29:25,532
Come on.

353
00:29:34,351 --> 00:29:36,046
Hey, what have you done to this horse?

354
00:29:36,219 --> 00:29:39,552
- Please, Mr. Buck, they killed my father.
- And they almost killed mine.

355
00:29:45,495 --> 00:29:47,224
You're breaking my heart.

356
00:29:47,397 --> 00:29:51,629
All right, look, no whining, no complaining,
no fighting, or I'm adiós.

357
00:29:51,835 --> 00:29:53,063
I never whine.

358
00:29:53,236 --> 00:29:56,535
- Oh, please.
- "Oh, please." Well, I don't.

359
00:29:56,707 --> 00:29:59,198
- Don't. Don't hit.
- Don't hit me. Stop.

360
00:29:59,376 --> 00:30:00,775
- Don't hit me.
- Don't hit me.

361
00:30:00,944 --> 00:30:02,605
Ladies. Hey.

362
00:30:02,779 --> 00:30:04,713
What's it gonna be?

363
00:30:08,719 --> 00:30:10,050
- Deal.
- Deal.

364
00:30:13,957 --> 00:30:15,185
All right, you first.

365
00:30:22,999 --> 00:30:24,694
That's pretty good.

366
00:30:25,635 --> 00:30:27,967
- How many you got left?
- I don't know.

367
00:30:31,441 --> 00:30:32,806
You need to know.

368
00:30:32,976 --> 00:30:36,605
Many a man's been left to die
for want of an extra bullet.

369
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,771
She's not very good with numbers.

370
00:30:38,949 --> 00:30:40,610
Your turn.

371
00:30:50,594 --> 00:30:52,562
I can't do this.

372
00:30:52,729 --> 00:30:54,594
When I get nervous, I get the hiccups.

373
00:30:55,098 --> 00:30:56,565
Guns make you nervous?

374
00:30:56,733 --> 00:30:58,724
What the hell are you gonna use
to rob banks?

375
00:30:58,902 --> 00:31:00,699
My education.

376
00:31:01,505 --> 00:31:03,097
- "My education."
- What's so funny?

377
00:31:03,273 --> 00:31:05,468
- To rob banks. Rob a bank.
- "My education."

378
00:31:07,244 --> 00:31:10,008
You wish you had one,
you ignorant crack-shot showoff.

379
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:14,674
Fort Granger, Oklahoma, U.S. Cavalry.
That's my education.

380
00:31:16,853 --> 00:31:19,617
Hey. Hey. Hey.

381
00:31:20,424 --> 00:31:22,654
No one moves.

382
00:31:23,493 --> 00:31:25,654
Get on the floor.

383
00:31:25,862 --> 00:31:29,559
How are they gonna get on the floor?
I told them not to move.

384
00:31:29,733 --> 00:31:31,200
Right.

385
00:31:31,368 --> 00:31:33,962
So get on the floor and no one move.

386
00:31:36,706 --> 00:31:39,402
Sara. Sara.

387
00:31:39,576 --> 00:31:41,476
- I have to tell you something.
- Hold on.

388
00:31:41,645 --> 00:31:44,546
Why are we doing this?
This has nothing to do with robbing banks.

389
00:31:44,714 --> 00:31:46,648
Robbing banks is easy.

390
00:31:46,817 --> 00:31:48,648
It's getting away
that's the hard part.

391
00:31:48,819 --> 00:31:51,219
- Sara.
- How long do we have to stay like this?

392
00:31:52,389 --> 00:31:54,220
- As long as it takes.
- Sara.

393
00:31:54,391 --> 00:31:55,722
What?

394
00:31:55,892 --> 00:31:57,951
I don't think I can hold any longer.

395
00:31:58,128 --> 00:32:00,619
So drop off and swim to the shore.

396
00:32:00,797 --> 00:32:02,628
I can't swim.

397
00:32:13,143 --> 00:32:14,872
Sara.

398
00:32:18,048 --> 00:32:19,276
Sara.

399
00:32:34,297 --> 00:32:35,594
Hold on to the rock.

400
00:33:05,362 --> 00:33:06,693
Thank you.

401
00:33:06,863 --> 00:33:08,490
- For what?
- For saving my life.

402
00:33:09,466 --> 00:33:11,627
You noticed this time.

403
00:33:12,235 --> 00:33:13,725
Good.

404
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,069
- Sara.
- What?

405
00:33:19,476 --> 00:33:22,741
I guess...
I guess this makes us friends now.

406
00:33:23,947 --> 00:33:26,415
I don't know about friends.

407
00:33:27,117 --> 00:33:29,085
But partners...

408
00:33:32,689 --> 00:33:35,089
Definitely partners.

409
00:33:44,701 --> 00:33:46,566
Single file.

410
00:33:47,571 --> 00:33:49,630
You gotta aim. Aim the gun.

411
00:33:49,806 --> 00:33:51,239
Aim it.

412
00:33:51,508 --> 00:33:53,135
Go on, higher. Higher. Higher.

413
00:33:54,911 --> 00:33:56,242
Stinky, I'm sorry.

414
00:33:58,348 --> 00:34:00,908
Come on, go. Faster, faster.

415
00:34:19,002 --> 00:34:22,267
Before you kill your dog,
we need to try something.

416
00:34:22,439 --> 00:34:25,237
Just take that.
See what you can do with those.

417
00:34:36,019 --> 00:34:37,646
See, I knew she had talent.

418
00:34:39,789 --> 00:34:44,158
Two hundred and forty-four, 245, 246...

419
00:34:44,327 --> 00:34:47,990
...247, 248, 24...

420
00:35:47,757 --> 00:35:49,782
That's the expert?

421
00:35:55,765 --> 00:35:57,426
Mr. Cooke...

422
00:35:57,834 --> 00:36:00,064
...welcome to Mexico.

423
00:36:00,737 --> 00:36:03,035
Well, clearly, they're a pair of amateurs.

424
00:36:03,206 --> 00:36:05,674
Robbing a bank in less than a minute
with no casualties.

425
00:36:05,842 --> 00:36:08,743
I'd say they could pass as professionals.

426
00:36:11,514 --> 00:36:14,972
That's odd.
These land transfers they left behind.

427
00:36:15,151 --> 00:36:17,244
Who would sell a farm for one peso?

428
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,648
Mr. Cooke...

429
00:36:18,822 --> 00:36:21,791
...the claim is that you're an expert
in criminal science, correct?

430
00:36:21,958 --> 00:36:25,655
- Yes.
- Down here, I'm the expert in land finance.

431
00:36:25,829 --> 00:36:30,732
So why don't we both just focus on
our respective areas of expertise, okay?

432
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,300
Time's slipping away here.

433
00:36:35,405 --> 00:36:38,135
All right, what's the first rule
of robbing a bank?

434
00:36:38,308 --> 00:36:40,503
- No one gets killed.
- The second?

435
00:36:40,677 --> 00:36:42,736
Don't take more than you can carry
in one hand.

436
00:36:42,912 --> 00:36:45,176
- And the third?
- Getting away is the first rule.

437
00:36:45,582 --> 00:36:46,742
Perfect.

438
00:36:47,617 --> 00:36:49,175
So do you think we're ready?

439
00:36:49,652 --> 00:36:52,246
Well, you really only needed
to know one thing all along...

440
00:36:52,422 --> 00:36:54,287
...and you learned that back in the river.

441
00:36:54,457 --> 00:36:56,152
Trust your partner with your life.

442
00:36:58,495 --> 00:37:01,521
Why did you make us go through
everything else if we were ready?

443
00:37:02,532 --> 00:37:03,760
Well...

444
00:37:03,933 --> 00:37:06,094
...I kind of liked having you two around.

445
00:37:10,006 --> 00:37:11,337
Now go rob me some banks.

446
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,668
Everybody, hands up.

447
00:38:18,141 --> 00:38:20,701
Are you sure the room
has been left undisturbed...

448
00:38:20,877 --> 00:38:22,401
...since the death?
- Yes.

449
00:38:23,479 --> 00:38:26,414
- You've worked here for a long time?
- Almost 20 years.

450
00:38:29,385 --> 00:38:32,582
Do you know if he took any medication
for his heart condition?

451
00:38:32,755 --> 00:38:35,918
Don Diego was healthy as a horse.

452
00:38:36,092 --> 00:38:38,253
He was never sick a day in his life.

453
00:38:39,863 --> 00:38:41,387
Thank you.

454
00:38:41,564 --> 00:38:43,896
If you'll excuse me.

455
00:39:11,427 --> 00:39:14,487
This should cover the mortgage
on the five farms north of the river.

456
00:39:14,664 --> 00:39:17,690
I was thinking, you know,
we already have a lot of money.

457
00:39:17,867 --> 00:39:20,665
Maybe we should stop
before the regulators...

458
00:39:20,837 --> 00:39:23,237
Padre, they took 10 banks,
we take 10 banks.

459
00:39:23,406 --> 00:39:27,308
- Right. We still have five to go.
- Four.

460
00:39:27,477 --> 00:39:28,774
That's what I said. Four.

461
00:39:28,945 --> 00:39:32,676
But one of my parishioners
told me about a specialist...

462
00:39:32,849 --> 00:39:36,080
...they brought in.
- A specialist?

463
00:39:36,653 --> 00:39:39,417
- For us?
- I'm afraid yes.

464
00:39:39,589 --> 00:39:41,580
A detective from New York.

465
00:39:42,492 --> 00:39:44,153
Let him come.

466
00:39:54,771 --> 00:39:56,762
Are you Padre Pablo?

467
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,737
Yes.

468
00:39:59,409 --> 00:40:01,604
- May I come in?
- No.

469
00:40:02,946 --> 00:40:06,541
I thought the house of God was open
to all people at all times.

470
00:40:06,916 --> 00:40:10,909
It is. But God is not at home right now.

471
00:40:11,087 --> 00:40:14,682
He is down the road at the orphanage...

472
00:40:14,857 --> 00:40:17,519
...where I was just going.

473
00:40:18,528 --> 00:40:20,689
I'm Quentin Cooke.

474
00:40:21,965 --> 00:40:24,160
I know who you are, Mr. Cooke.

475
00:40:24,334 --> 00:40:25,528
Oh, you do?

476
00:40:25,702 --> 00:40:28,865
It's my job to know
what concerns my flock.

477
00:40:29,706 --> 00:40:32,368
Okay. Well, then maybe you can help me.

478
00:40:33,076 --> 00:40:34,373
This girl.

479
00:40:34,544 --> 00:40:37,035
- I was wondering if you could tell me...
- No.

480
00:40:38,414 --> 00:40:39,711
I didn't finish the question.

481
00:40:40,083 --> 00:40:42,483
You want to know if I have seen her.

482
00:40:43,052 --> 00:40:45,418
No, I'm sure you haven't seen her.

483
00:40:45,588 --> 00:40:48,523
I was wondering if you could tell me
if she had any problems...

484
00:40:48,691 --> 00:40:51,216
...with her father.
- I loved my father.

485
00:40:51,394 --> 00:40:53,055
Why does he ask such a question?

486
00:40:53,229 --> 00:40:55,288
She loved her father.

487
00:40:55,465 --> 00:40:57,990
Why do you ask such a question?

488
00:40:58,167 --> 00:40:59,828
Just the way he died.

489
00:41:00,837 --> 00:41:02,065
Anyway...

490
00:41:03,873 --> 00:41:05,807
I'm staying at the hotel...

491
00:41:05,975 --> 00:41:08,068
...in Santa Rita
if you have any information.

492
00:41:15,051 --> 00:41:17,781
What did he mean
about the way my father died?

493
00:41:17,954 --> 00:41:19,854
You heard what I heard.

494
00:41:20,023 --> 00:41:23,618
If you want to know any more,
you will have to ask him.

495
00:41:29,198 --> 00:41:32,065
Come on. Come.

496
00:41:49,018 --> 00:41:51,043
We can take him right here.

497
00:41:52,188 --> 00:41:53,655
- What?
- Wonderful.

498
00:41:53,823 --> 00:41:56,519
- And how do we get the information?
- We ask him.

499
00:41:56,826 --> 00:41:59,886
Our picture's all over the town.

500
00:42:03,366 --> 00:42:05,698
So what? We wear bandannas.

501
00:42:05,868 --> 00:42:07,495
I have a better plan.

502
00:42:08,504 --> 00:42:12,201
Hello, mister. Do you want company?

503
00:42:42,105 --> 00:42:44,699
- What are you doing?
- Saving time.

504
00:42:49,679 --> 00:42:51,579
Yes?

505
00:42:58,821 --> 00:43:00,982
Wrong room.

506
00:43:01,157 --> 00:43:03,887
No. We're compliments
of the management.

507
00:43:05,194 --> 00:43:08,220
- She's new.
- I don't mean to offend you, ladies...

508
00:43:08,431 --> 00:43:09,989
...but I have a fiancée.

509
00:43:10,166 --> 00:43:12,794
- And we have some questions.
- Hands up.

510
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:15,597
- Down.
- Up.

511
00:43:15,771 --> 00:43:16,999
- Down.
- Up.

512
00:43:17,173 --> 00:43:20,301
- Down.
- Excuse us for a minute.

513
00:43:20,476 --> 00:43:23,707
- What? You've never seen one before?
- Yes, but in the dark.

514
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,108
Up.

515
00:43:25,281 --> 00:43:27,545
- My wallet's over there.
- This is not a robbery.

516
00:43:28,851 --> 00:43:30,648
Oh, my God.

517
00:43:31,187 --> 00:43:33,815
- You're them.
- Yes, it's us.

518
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:36,788
Well, you're not getting any answers
out of me.

519
00:43:36,959 --> 00:43:39,553
I will not dishonor my profession.

520
00:43:40,429 --> 00:43:42,090
Hey.

521
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:50,203
- Hey, what are you doing?
- We'll ask the questions.

522
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:53,070
Is this the fiancée?

523
00:43:53,242 --> 00:43:54,470
Not bad.

524
00:43:54,644 --> 00:43:57,943
- What are you doing?
- Puts me in the mood.

525
00:44:02,718 --> 00:44:04,345
- Ready?
- Smile.

526
00:44:12,028 --> 00:44:13,723
Beautiful.

527
00:44:15,097 --> 00:44:17,588
Unless you tell us everything
we want to know...

528
00:44:17,767 --> 00:44:21,760
...these pictures will show up in every
newspaper from here to New York.

529
00:44:22,405 --> 00:44:24,566
With a special set going to your fiancée.

530
00:44:25,841 --> 00:44:29,436
Then you won't have to worry
about dishonoring your profession.

531
00:44:29,612 --> 00:44:31,045
Because you won't have one.

532
00:44:33,683 --> 00:44:35,583
Now tell me about my father.

533
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:38,448
I won't tell you anything.

534
00:44:38,621 --> 00:44:40,486
- This is a waste of time.
- Hey, hey.

535
00:44:40,656 --> 00:44:43,557
Excuse my partner.
She's a bit impetuous.

536
00:44:43,726 --> 00:44:47,526
Mr. Cooke, I am asking you
as a daughter who lost her father.

537
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:56,966
- Did your father drink wine?
- His passion.

538
00:44:57,173 --> 00:45:00,370
I don't think he died of a heart attack.
I think he was poisoned.

539
00:45:01,544 --> 00:45:03,774
- How do you know that?
- Scientific methodology.

540
00:45:03,946 --> 00:45:06,244
It doesn't give you the right
to rob American banks.

541
00:45:06,415 --> 00:45:07,973
Those are Mexican banks.

542
00:45:08,184 --> 00:45:11,017
Those banks are owned by
Capital Bank and Trust of New York...

543
00:45:11,187 --> 00:45:13,655
...and are under the protection
of American laws.

544
00:45:14,090 --> 00:45:16,786
Interesting how your country
always finds a way to justify...

545
00:45:16,959 --> 00:45:19,427
...interfering in other people's affairs.

546
00:45:19,595 --> 00:45:21,495
You're still breaking the law.

547
00:45:21,664 --> 00:45:23,427
- You're the one breaking the law.
- What?

548
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:24,998
By helping them rob our people.

549
00:45:27,003 --> 00:45:28,800
Help. Hel...

550
00:45:34,343 --> 00:45:37,039
Enough with the hat. The hat belongs...

551
00:45:37,213 --> 00:45:38,976
...on this man. And that...

552
00:45:39,448 --> 00:45:40,881
That's nothing to be ashamed of.

553
00:45:41,651 --> 00:45:44,518
Who said I was ashamed?
Did I say I was ashamed?

554
00:45:44,687 --> 00:45:47,121
- Have you ever even been with a man?
- Yes.

555
00:45:47,290 --> 00:45:49,520
- Of course.
- You haven't.

556
00:45:49,692 --> 00:45:52,058
- Yes, I have.
- Prove it.

557
00:45:53,462 --> 00:45:56,260
Do you want me to produce
a piece of paper signed by a witness?

558
00:45:56,432 --> 00:45:57,831
- No, kiss him.
- What?

559
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,991
- What?
- Well...

560
00:46:00,636 --> 00:46:02,968
...if you kiss a man right,
he will never forget you.

561
00:46:03,139 --> 00:46:05,334
If you kiss him wrong,
he will never remember you.

562
00:46:05,508 --> 00:46:07,408
If you have made love to a man...

563
00:46:07,576 --> 00:46:10,238
...you know this.
If you haven't, you don't.

564
00:46:10,413 --> 00:46:12,540
So that's the proof. Kiss him.

565
00:46:15,217 --> 00:46:16,343
I ca...

566
00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:22,348
I have a fian...

567
00:46:24,894 --> 00:46:26,020
- cée.

568
00:46:28,464 --> 00:46:31,865
If you kiss a man like that, you'll be
forgotten before you leave the room.

569
00:46:32,034 --> 00:46:34,298
- Is that what you want?
- No.

570
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:36,097
Watch.

571
00:46:39,008 --> 00:46:40,066
I don't...

572
00:46:40,242 --> 00:46:42,107
I don't think that...

573
00:46:51,787 --> 00:46:54,847
- That's a kiss.
- That's a kiss.

574
00:46:55,024 --> 00:46:57,185
Now you try it.

575
00:46:57,927 --> 00:47:00,020
Come on.

576
00:47:00,196 --> 00:47:03,029
Think of the sweetest summer fruit.

577
00:47:07,870 --> 00:47:09,599
Open.

578
00:47:20,816 --> 00:47:23,546
- How was that?
- Better.

579
00:47:23,719 --> 00:47:27,519
- I thought that was pretty good.
- Yes, technically.

580
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:29,180
But now...

581
00:47:30,826 --> 00:47:33,886
...you have to capture the nuance.

582
00:47:40,936 --> 00:47:42,665
- Sara.
- What?

583
00:47:42,838 --> 00:47:44,931
It's 10 to 3.

584
00:47:45,441 --> 00:47:47,102
- Sara.
- What?

585
00:47:47,276 --> 00:47:49,608
- The bank closes at 3.
- Damn.

586
00:47:53,983 --> 00:47:57,612
- Where are you taking me?
- You said you wanted proof, huh?

587
00:48:07,596 --> 00:48:10,997
- You already took all the money.
- We're not here for the money, Bernardo.

588
00:48:12,067 --> 00:48:13,500
Here's your proof.

589
00:48:14,370 --> 00:48:15,803
Who sells a farm for one peso?

590
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:19,130
Who'd sell a farm for one peso?

591
00:48:19,575 --> 00:48:20,633
Here...

592
00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:24,746
...check the deeds against the railroad map,
and you'll see who the real criminal is.

593
00:49:25,574 --> 00:49:28,372
Señoritas, I think there is something
you should see.

594
00:49:32,114 --> 00:49:34,446
- Please tell me you have a plan.
- No.

595
00:49:46,328 --> 00:49:49,161
We have two choices. Run or fight.

596
00:49:49,331 --> 00:49:51,561
Right. Die now or die later.

597
00:49:51,734 --> 00:49:53,725
- Well, do you have a better idea?
- I do.

598
00:49:58,132 --> 00:50:01,363
- Put your guns down or we'll kill him.
- That's fine by me.

599
00:50:01,536 --> 00:50:03,697
I said, put them down. Now.

600
00:50:03,871 --> 00:50:06,203
He's the boss' son-in-law.

601
00:50:11,279 --> 00:50:13,110
Never mind.

602
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:27,156
The expert from New York City...

603
00:50:27,395 --> 00:50:29,226
...he was kidnapped by the bandidas, sir.

604
00:50:29,397 --> 00:50:32,332
- Excuse me? What?
- He was kidnapped by the bandidas.

605
00:50:34,168 --> 00:50:35,658
How exactly did that happen?

606
00:50:35,837 --> 00:50:38,635
He was in the bank,
right in the middle of his investigation...

607
00:50:38,806 --> 00:50:41,104
...when these two she-monsters
overwhelmed him.

608
00:50:41,275 --> 00:50:42,970
They took him by force.

609
00:50:43,144 --> 00:50:45,840
Oh, my God. My poor darling.

610
00:50:46,013 --> 00:50:47,446
Don't tell me they killed him.

611
00:50:52,887 --> 00:50:57,347
Now, I'm out of time here,
and I am completely out of patience.

612
00:50:57,892 --> 00:51:03,091
And I would dearly like to see
those two little split-legged bitches dead!

613
00:51:06,801 --> 00:51:08,029
Follow me.

614
00:51:09,303 --> 00:51:11,066
- Get in there.
- Yes, sir.

615
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:27,749
What is this?

616
00:51:28,689 --> 00:51:32,785
- It's fingerprint powder.
- What's fingerprint?

617
00:51:35,196 --> 00:51:37,357
You see these swirls on your finger?

618
00:51:37,531 --> 00:51:41,194
If you touch something at a crime scene,
I put some of that powder on it...

619
00:51:41,369 --> 00:51:44,497
...and then I can see your fingerprint.
I know that you've been there.

620
00:51:44,672 --> 00:51:45,900
How do you know it's mine?

621
00:51:46,073 --> 00:51:48,564
Because no two people
have the same fingerprint.

622
00:51:50,745 --> 00:51:53,714
- Have you checked everyone in the world?
- No.

623
00:51:54,415 --> 00:51:56,076
But it's proven by science.

624
00:51:57,418 --> 00:51:59,318
Doesn't sound very scientific to me.

625
00:52:00,354 --> 00:52:03,323
- And what is this?
- Oh, that's a microscope.

626
00:52:04,892 --> 00:52:06,484
It...

627
00:52:07,028 --> 00:52:10,122
...helps you see things
that you can't normally see.

628
00:52:11,332 --> 00:52:12,424
Like a thought?

629
00:52:13,034 --> 00:52:15,662
Yeah, sort of.

630
00:52:29,350 --> 00:52:31,648
I don't see anything.

631
00:52:32,053 --> 00:52:33,714
Think harder.

632
00:52:35,723 --> 00:52:38,590
- Sara, what's wrong?
- What's wrong? Everything is wrong.

633
00:52:38,759 --> 00:52:41,853
Jackson's brought in reinforcements,
real killers.

634
00:52:42,029 --> 00:52:44,190
Every bank is guarded now.

635
00:52:45,099 --> 00:52:48,034
They're hunting us like animals,
and I'm running out of ideas.

636
00:52:48,202 --> 00:52:51,933
I don't wanna disappoint these people,
but I don't think I can do this.

637
00:52:52,106 --> 00:52:55,633
- I think you can.
- Quentin, look at me.

638
00:52:55,810 --> 00:52:59,371
I was raised to be a spoiled lady,
not a renegade.

639
00:52:59,547 --> 00:53:02,607
One minute I think I have
all the answers, and the next...

640
00:53:02,783 --> 00:53:06,913
...I am crying for a manicure.
I am lost out here.

641
00:53:07,088 --> 00:53:09,318
Or maybe I'm just lost.

642
00:53:09,824 --> 00:53:12,725
My mother is gone. My father is gone.

643
00:53:14,328 --> 00:53:16,023
I have no place in the world.

644
00:53:16,197 --> 00:53:19,223
Maybe out here is where you belong.

645
00:53:21,235 --> 00:53:23,703
Besides, you're not alone.

646
00:53:23,871 --> 00:53:25,600
Right.

647
00:53:25,773 --> 00:53:28,173
A gun-happy farm girl, an ugly dog...

648
00:53:28,342 --> 00:53:31,800
...a wet-behind-the-ears cop
and a spoiled brat.

649
00:53:31,979 --> 00:53:34,140
What a team.

650
00:53:34,315 --> 00:53:38,445
This may seem odd,
having dedicated myself to the law...

651
00:53:39,487 --> 00:53:43,583
...but I think what you are doing here
is good. In fact, I think it's damn noble.

652
00:53:43,758 --> 00:53:45,692
And I'd like to help.

653
00:53:47,661 --> 00:53:49,151
How?

654
00:53:50,931 --> 00:53:52,762
They're looking for two women, correct?

655
00:53:55,603 --> 00:53:58,834
I guess this is what it feels like, huh?

656
00:53:59,006 --> 00:54:01,804
- To be married.
- Yes.

657
00:54:03,244 --> 00:54:06,975
- May I ask you a favor?
- Of course, it's our wedding day.

658
00:54:07,148 --> 00:54:10,413
Can we lose the horse?
He's a little obvious.

659
00:54:10,584 --> 00:54:13,644
Don't distract him.
I need him to concentrate.

660
00:54:15,389 --> 00:54:16,754
You know what you have to do.

661
00:54:21,562 --> 00:54:23,553
Okay, here we are.

662
00:54:34,041 --> 00:54:35,338
It'll never work.

663
00:54:36,310 --> 00:54:38,904
Because she's wearing the wrong shoes.

664
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:42,743
I would have done it myself, but I'd
rather die than be seen in that cheap dress.

665
00:54:44,785 --> 00:54:47,515
Good day. Welcome to our bank.

666
00:54:48,456 --> 00:54:50,117
Welcome.

667
00:54:50,991 --> 00:54:52,253
Step in, please.

668
00:54:53,928 --> 00:54:57,728
I assure you, your family jewelry
will be quite secure.

669
00:54:57,898 --> 00:55:01,732
He takes such good care of me,
my Quentin.

670
00:55:08,209 --> 00:55:10,177
The slut.

671
00:55:10,878 --> 00:55:13,039
She can't even get the kiss right.

672
00:55:13,214 --> 00:55:15,205
Come on, we've got work to do.

673
00:55:19,453 --> 00:55:21,182
She's very excited.

674
00:55:30,431 --> 00:55:35,835
The walls are 2 feet of poured cement
reinforced with iron bars...

675
00:55:36,003 --> 00:55:41,942
...and the safe is bolted into the ground,
which is 3 feet of solid rock.

676
00:55:57,558 --> 00:55:59,685
- Did you hear that?
- What?

677
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:02,590
It sounded like a horse on the roof.

678
00:56:04,598 --> 00:56:07,260
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to
ask you a personal question.

679
00:56:07,434 --> 00:56:09,868
- You don't drink before dinner, do you?
- Of course not.

680
00:56:10,037 --> 00:56:13,598
I was just wondering.
Hearing horses on the roof...

681
00:56:16,043 --> 00:56:18,170
- Can we see inside the safe?
- Sorry.

682
00:56:18,345 --> 00:56:20,939
Unless you are actually ready
to make your deposit.

683
00:56:22,550 --> 00:56:25,781
How about for withdrawals?

684
00:56:30,624 --> 00:56:33,593
Great. Just great.

685
00:56:33,761 --> 00:56:36,093
I didn't know he was going to faint.

686
00:56:36,263 --> 00:56:38,254
These are like megaphones.

687
00:56:38,432 --> 00:56:40,024
Quiet.

688
00:56:41,602 --> 00:56:45,402
- Are you sure you can open it with that?
- No, not officially.

689
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:47,930
Hey.

690
00:57:09,597 --> 00:57:10,962
Can't you go any faster?

691
00:57:11,131 --> 00:57:15,227
I am going as fast as somebody who's
half-deaf can go, thank you very much.

692
00:57:22,576 --> 00:57:25,739
- Come out with your hands up.
- How much longer?

693
00:57:34,722 --> 00:57:36,485
I did it.

694
00:57:36,657 --> 00:57:39,217
I did it. I did it.

695
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:47,831
Open this damn door.

696
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:54,466
Fire.

697
00:58:05,886 --> 00:58:07,353
You've only got one more chance.

698
00:58:08,289 --> 00:58:09,950
I know.

699
00:58:27,074 --> 00:58:29,167
They blew the safe.

700
00:58:38,686 --> 00:58:39,914
There it is.

701
00:58:41,755 --> 00:58:43,518
Okay, you got it?

702
00:58:43,691 --> 00:58:45,921
- Okay, let's go.
- Can I ask you something?

703
00:58:46,093 --> 00:58:48,027
- What?
- How was my kiss?

704
00:58:49,096 --> 00:58:50,688
Perfect.

705
00:59:16,423 --> 00:59:18,550
How the hell?

706
00:59:23,831 --> 00:59:25,355
Come on.

707
00:59:45,085 --> 00:59:48,851
- Anything wrong, Mr. Jackson?
- Nothing to be concerned about...

708
00:59:49,590 --> 00:59:50,579
...governor.

709
00:59:50,758 --> 00:59:53,386
To be honest, Mr. Jackson,
some of my ministers...

710
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:57,656
...are concerned about the safety
of our state's gold deposit in your bank.

711
00:59:57,831 --> 01:00:00,664
They are suggesting perhaps
we move the gold...

712
01:00:00,834 --> 01:00:02,768
...to a bank not owned by your company.

713
01:00:02,936 --> 01:00:07,339
Governor, that gold is as safe as
if it was deposited in my own pocket.

714
01:00:07,508 --> 01:00:11,103
Judging by the success you have
at stopping these bandidas...

715
01:00:11,278 --> 01:00:14,372
...you may want to check your pockets.

716
01:00:15,983 --> 01:00:17,450
May I show you something?

717
01:00:21,288 --> 01:00:22,949
Now, governor, this is a prototype...

718
01:00:23,123 --> 01:00:25,648
...of a revolutionary new system
in security devices.

719
01:00:25,826 --> 01:00:28,693
We're installing this as fast as we can
in all of our banks...

720
01:00:28,862 --> 01:00:31,126
...including the one that holds
your gold deposits.

721
01:00:31,298 --> 01:00:34,096
You. Step on the floor.

722
01:00:36,703 --> 01:00:39,638
Step-o on-o floor-o.

723
01:00:47,681 --> 01:00:49,171
Cut it off.

724
01:00:51,318 --> 01:00:56,221
That floor is fitted with a system that
reacts to the slightest change in weight.

725
01:00:56,390 --> 01:01:01,726
Before anyone can reach that safe,
they'll be dead! Dead.

726
01:01:02,663 --> 01:01:05,359
I'm reassured that our gold
is in very good hands.

727
01:01:05,532 --> 01:01:07,796
- Thank you, governor.
- But I am also concerned...

728
01:01:07,968 --> 01:01:11,267
...about our people
who deposit their money in your bank.

729
01:01:11,438 --> 01:01:12,905
Without the new system.

730
01:01:13,073 --> 01:01:15,974
You know, these bandidas can strike
anywhere, at any time.

731
01:01:16,143 --> 01:01:19,044
Governor, may I tell you something
in confidence?

732
01:01:19,213 --> 01:01:25,777
Until those new systems are installed,
all the cash will be stored upstairs.

733
01:01:25,953 --> 01:01:28,478
They'll never get anywhere near it.

734
01:01:34,895 --> 01:01:36,419
I'm so sorry for your loss.

735
01:01:36,797 --> 01:01:39,595
- Her mother was her life.
- I completely understand.

736
01:01:39,833 --> 01:01:42,324
My daughter is the same way
with her mother.

737
01:01:42,503 --> 01:01:46,337
She would just die
if the jewelry that her mother left her...

738
01:01:46,507 --> 01:01:49,908
...wasn't in the safest place,
which is why I brought her here.

739
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:54,877
Sweetheart, you understand me...

740
01:01:55,048 --> 01:01:57,380
...so well.

741
01:02:08,362 --> 01:02:09,852
She's very upset.

742
01:02:11,064 --> 01:02:13,123
If I may share a confidence with you.

743
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:17,737
Today we put in the most advanced
security system known to man.

744
01:02:17,905 --> 01:02:20,237
- Can we see it?
- Sorry.

745
01:02:20,407 --> 01:02:21,874
No one can see it.

746
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:42,754
- We can't do it.
- Yes, we can.

747
01:02:42,930 --> 01:02:46,696
Sara, the only space on the floor
that's not covered by an alarm...

748
01:02:46,867 --> 01:02:48,334
...is 1 inch between the seam.

749
01:02:48,502 --> 01:02:52,268
- What would you use to get across?
- Her education.

750
01:02:52,439 --> 01:02:54,430
At least I have one to use.

751
01:02:54,608 --> 01:02:56,974
And what are you gonna use
to open the vault?

752
01:02:57,144 --> 01:02:58,509
The key.

753
01:03:19,032 --> 01:03:21,023
- Nice shot.
- Thank you.

754
01:03:21,201 --> 01:03:22,634
- What's this?
- Be careful.

755
01:03:22,803 --> 01:03:26,239
Those are darts dipped into a compound
made from tree bark in South America.

756
01:03:26,406 --> 01:03:30,502
The Indians use it to hunt. It doesn't kill
the animal, but it'll put it to sleep.

757
01:03:30,677 --> 01:03:32,838
So if you have a problem, you use this.

758
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:35,177
Okay, go.

759
01:03:39,353 --> 01:03:40,786
I got it.

760
01:03:40,954 --> 01:03:42,854
Okay. Okay.

761
01:03:53,567 --> 01:03:55,194
Go.

762
01:03:59,206 --> 01:04:00,730
- Come on.
- Okay.

763
01:04:48,655 --> 01:04:50,555
Calm down.

764
01:05:20,687 --> 01:05:22,484
Sorry.

765
01:05:45,612 --> 01:05:47,102
Great.

766
01:05:51,017 --> 01:05:53,315
- When's the last time you were on these?
- I was 10.

767
01:05:53,487 --> 01:05:55,352
- Oh, great.
- Don't worry. I can do this.

768
01:05:55,522 --> 01:05:59,014
Okay. There's no need to rush.
Just don't take any chances.

769
01:05:59,192 --> 01:06:00,989
Just stay calm.

770
01:06:01,528 --> 01:06:03,519
- Don't be nervous.
- You're making me nervous.

771
01:06:03,697 --> 01:06:05,460
Okay, I'm sorry. Okay, okay.

772
01:06:10,971 --> 01:06:12,199
What's wrong?

773
01:06:12,372 --> 01:06:15,205
- I need to be calm.
- Yes, you're right. Calm down.

774
01:06:22,916 --> 01:06:25,714
- Okay, I'm calm now.
- Me too.

775
01:06:32,092 --> 01:06:34,287
How was my kiss?

776
01:06:34,795 --> 01:06:37,355
- It was perfect.
- I knew it.

777
01:06:49,709 --> 01:06:51,176
Sara.

778
01:06:51,778 --> 01:06:54,372
- Do you really have to sing?
- Yes.

779
01:06:54,981 --> 01:06:57,347
- It puts me in the mood.
- Okay.

780
01:07:20,373 --> 01:07:22,807
Bravo. Bravo.

781
01:07:27,981 --> 01:07:29,448
Santa Maria.

782
01:07:29,616 --> 01:07:30,878
Oh, my G...

783
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:34,517
I'm gonna go check the vault.

784
01:07:34,688 --> 01:07:36,747
- Right.
- I'll stick that banjo up...

785
01:07:37,624 --> 01:07:38,921
I ain't got none of that.

786
01:07:44,598 --> 01:07:47,499
Hey, what's the matter with you?

787
01:07:47,667 --> 01:07:49,567
You all right?

788
01:08:09,689 --> 01:08:12,214
Tequila must be pretty good down here.

789
01:08:15,428 --> 01:08:16,417
Sara.

790
01:08:17,497 --> 01:08:19,089
Come on, hurry up.

791
01:08:19,266 --> 01:08:20,927
I'm doing my best.

792
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:28,599
- Everything calm?
- Yeah.

793
01:08:39,185 --> 01:08:42,746
- What are you doing?
- My father raised me to finish what I start.

794
01:08:42,923 --> 01:08:46,518
If I'm going to rob a bank,
I'm going to do it properly.

795
01:08:47,761 --> 01:08:49,626
Damn idiot,
what are you doing with my gun?

796
01:08:49,796 --> 01:08:51,388
Don't you call me a damn idiot.

797
01:08:56,503 --> 01:08:58,437
Okay, slow, slow, slow.

798
01:08:58,905 --> 01:09:01,499
- Who are you calling a damn idiot?
- I told you...

799
01:09:06,780 --> 01:09:09,544
Come on. Okay. Come on.

800
01:09:10,650 --> 01:09:12,481
- Shut up.
- Stop.

801
01:09:24,597 --> 01:09:25,586
Oh, God.

802
01:09:28,668 --> 01:09:30,465
Quentin.

803
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:35,535
Hold it.

804
01:09:35,709 --> 01:09:37,006
Wake up.

805
01:09:37,711 --> 01:09:39,235
Hold it.

806
01:09:42,315 --> 01:09:43,304
Hold it.

807
01:09:44,751 --> 01:09:47,618
Quentin. Sara.

808
01:09:48,822 --> 01:09:50,517
Come on, let's go.

809
01:09:59,099 --> 01:10:01,761
No, no. Other way. Other way.

810
01:10:10,477 --> 01:10:12,672
Party's over.

811
01:10:15,715 --> 01:10:18,206
Looks like we're about to start the party.

812
01:10:18,385 --> 01:10:20,876
You might wanna get ready
to do last rites, Padre...

813
01:10:21,054 --> 01:10:23,488
...or whatever it is you all do.

814
01:10:28,028 --> 01:10:32,362
I can't believe you can't even do
a simple thing like stare at the street.

815
01:10:32,532 --> 01:10:35,865
- You were supposed to be looking out.
- I was.

816
01:10:36,036 --> 01:10:37,867
If you were, we wouldn't be sitting here.

817
01:10:38,038 --> 01:10:40,268
If you weren't greedy,
you would've been faster.

818
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:42,874
You are inefficient and unprofessional.

819
01:10:43,043 --> 01:10:44,806
Think I didn't see you sneaking kisses?

820
01:10:44,978 --> 01:10:46,639
I was a bride. That's what we do.

821
01:10:46,813 --> 01:10:48,280
And don't play innocent with me.

822
01:10:48,448 --> 01:10:50,814
I saw you sticking your tongue
down his throat.

823
01:10:50,984 --> 01:10:54,579
What kind of a bride smells like a horse
and kisses like a chicken pecking corn?

824
01:10:54,754 --> 01:10:56,949
I was a sad widow in need of comfort.

825
01:10:57,123 --> 01:10:59,751
Well, for your information,
he said my kiss was perfect.

826
01:10:59,926 --> 01:11:01,325
For your information, he said...

827
01:11:01,494 --> 01:11:04,554
For your information,
I'm sick of you both fighting over kisses...

828
01:11:04,731 --> 01:11:07,825
...when the future
of your country is at stake.

829
01:11:08,134 --> 01:11:10,602
How did I ever fall for this?
You're not serious.

830
01:11:10,770 --> 01:11:13,671
You're silly girls playing
with the lives of thousands of people.

831
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:15,273
A spoiled brat and a farm hand.

832
01:11:15,442 --> 01:11:19,105
You think people are gonna follow you?
You think you're changing history?

833
01:11:19,279 --> 01:11:20,712
What was I thinking?

834
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:25,317
Throwing away my life and my career.
And for what?

835
01:11:25,718 --> 01:11:27,151
You know the saddest part?

836
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:29,311
No one will care,
nothing will have changed...

837
01:11:29,556 --> 01:11:31,183
...because we're gonna be hanged!

838
01:11:58,651 --> 01:12:00,744
I might not know who I am...

839
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:03,047
...but I know who I'm not.

840
01:12:03,223 --> 01:12:06,158
And I'm not someone
who's gonna let her country down.

841
01:12:16,269 --> 01:12:18,669
Governor, I have good news,
and I have bad news.

842
01:12:18,838 --> 01:12:22,296
Now, the good news is that my people
were able to save a portion of the money.

843
01:12:22,876 --> 01:12:26,175
We even had both bandidas in custody.

844
01:12:26,346 --> 01:12:30,476
The bad news is your people freed them.

845
01:12:32,919 --> 01:12:35,888
Mr. Jackson, I must apologize to you.

846
01:12:36,055 --> 01:12:39,320
I never expected the situation
to become so unstable.

847
01:12:39,492 --> 01:12:41,517
Your help has been invaluable.

848
01:12:41,694 --> 01:12:45,255
But now I don't know what to do.
I'm hoping you have a solution.

849
01:12:45,431 --> 01:12:49,868
You can rest assured, the Capital Bank
and Trust of New York has a solution.

850
01:12:50,036 --> 01:12:52,163
He said they're moving
the gold reserve to Texas.

851
01:12:52,772 --> 01:12:54,637
What does it mean?

852
01:12:54,807 --> 01:12:57,367
It means it's over. He figured it out.

853
01:12:57,844 --> 01:13:00,438
- Figured what out?
- How to beat us.

854
01:13:00,613 --> 01:13:02,342
He's not beating us, we're beating him.

855
01:13:02,749 --> 01:13:05,240
Now we are strong enough
to take all the other banks.

856
01:13:05,685 --> 01:13:08,017
So let him have the gold.

857
01:13:08,188 --> 01:13:10,281
We'll have all the money.

858
01:13:10,456 --> 01:13:12,890
Maria, the money is just paper.

859
01:13:13,059 --> 01:13:15,357
It represents the value of the gold.

860
01:13:15,528 --> 01:13:17,860
It's what the entire monetary system
is based on.

861
01:13:18,031 --> 01:13:21,694
Without the gold, the paper has no value.

862
01:13:22,235 --> 01:13:23,634
Then we should rob the gold.

863
01:13:28,141 --> 01:13:29,631
Did I say something wrong?

864
01:13:34,581 --> 01:13:37,550
- Shut that and lock it.
- Yeah, right away.

865
01:13:46,059 --> 01:13:47,287
You know...

866
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:50,190
...this might be the last time
we get to talk.

867
01:13:50,363 --> 01:13:52,797
Don't say that. It's bad luck.

868
01:13:52,966 --> 01:13:56,060
I'm a superstitious peasant, remember?

869
01:13:56,402 --> 01:14:00,133
No, you're a lot more than that.

870
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:05,070
You always know what you want,
and you always know what you feel.

871
01:14:07,580 --> 01:14:09,070
I admire you, Maria.

872
01:14:13,052 --> 01:14:15,953
You admire me?
How can you admire me?

873
01:14:16,122 --> 01:14:19,216
All I know about is horses and chickens.

874
01:14:19,592 --> 01:14:20,820
Well...

875
01:14:20,994 --> 01:14:23,588
...now I also know
how to really give a good kiss.

876
01:14:31,437 --> 01:14:34,099
It's been good to have you as a partner.

877
01:14:40,046 --> 01:14:41,809
It's been good to have you as a friend.

878
01:14:43,650 --> 01:14:47,086
You've taught me a lot
about how to care about people.

879
01:14:56,296 --> 01:14:58,230
And you were a...

880
01:14:58,765 --> 01:15:00,232
You were a beautiful widow.

881
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:02,925
Well, black, it's always a flattering color.

882
01:15:03,102 --> 01:15:05,662
There's one more thing
I'd like to get off my chest.

883
01:15:07,874 --> 01:15:09,603
This bloody corset.

884
01:15:09,776 --> 01:15:12,609
It's been squeezing my gut
my whole life.

885
01:15:28,795 --> 01:15:31,059
Thank you so much for making the effort.

886
01:15:31,230 --> 01:15:34,529
Mr. Governor, it's not an effort,
it's an honor.

887
01:15:34,701 --> 01:15:37,499
You wanted me here
to show our support for your plan.

888
01:15:37,670 --> 01:15:38,898
Here I am.

889
01:15:39,572 --> 01:15:41,631
Señorita Clarissa...

890
01:15:41,808 --> 01:15:44,402
...thank you for gracing our journey
with your beauty.

891
01:15:44,577 --> 01:15:48,411
I wish I could be better company,
but I'm so nervous about my Quentin.

892
01:15:48,581 --> 01:15:51,414
- Is there any word?
- Mr. Jackson?

893
01:15:51,584 --> 01:15:55,350
I wouldn't be surprised if, by the end of
this ride, your man was back by your side.

894
01:15:55,521 --> 01:15:57,614
- Really?
- Really.

895
01:15:57,890 --> 01:16:00,484
Now if you'll excuse us, miss.
Gentlemen.

896
01:16:00,660 --> 01:16:03,094
- Did you hear that, Daddy?
- Every word.

897
01:16:03,629 --> 01:16:06,291
It's a sad state of affairs
when the wealth of my nation...

898
01:16:06,466 --> 01:16:08,195
...must be protected
by another country.

899
01:16:08,368 --> 01:16:11,929
Sir, let me assure you, you are acting
in the best interest of your people.

900
01:16:12,105 --> 01:16:15,836
Governor, if you don't mind, I'd like
for you to review our security measures.

901
01:16:16,175 --> 01:16:19,269
- Of course. Excuse me.
- Yes, yes, certainly.

902
01:16:19,445 --> 01:16:23,609
Mr. Jackson, was my trip down here
really necessary?

903
01:16:23,783 --> 01:16:25,808
Mr. Ashe...

904
01:16:26,085 --> 01:16:28,918
...to get that gold released
to be put onboard this train...

905
01:16:29,088 --> 01:16:31,147
...the governor needed
some show of confidence.

906
01:16:31,324 --> 01:16:33,315
In order to catch those two
thieving women...

907
01:16:33,493 --> 01:16:35,120
...I need that gold onboard.

908
01:16:35,294 --> 01:16:37,319
Catch them?
What do you mean, catch them?

909
01:16:37,497 --> 01:16:41,365
The walls have ears down here in Mexico,
so I whispered into them.

910
01:16:41,534 --> 01:16:43,331
That gold is my bait.

911
01:16:43,503 --> 01:16:45,994
And the fish are onboard,
I can guarantee you that.

912
01:16:46,172 --> 01:16:47,696
- Good God, man.
- All we gotta do...

913
01:16:47,874 --> 01:16:50,001
...is keep this train rolling up into Texas.

914
01:16:50,176 --> 01:16:53,236
That's where our law will take effect.
They'll be hanged by sundown.

915
01:16:53,413 --> 01:16:57,281
Hanging somebody without a fair trial
is not our law, Mr. Jackson.

916
01:16:57,450 --> 01:17:01,147
Oh, it will be.
As soon as those two pop up.

917
01:17:12,832 --> 01:17:16,359
There is no security out here,
Mr. Jackson.

918
01:17:16,536 --> 01:17:19,164
Oh, but quite to the contrary, governor.

919
01:17:19,338 --> 01:17:20,930
Indeed, there is.

920
01:17:21,107 --> 01:17:23,541
Security for my old age.

921
01:17:23,709 --> 01:17:26,701
Your gold.
Or, rather, should I say, my gold.

922
01:17:26,879 --> 01:17:29,541
- I'm not following.
- No, sir, you're not.

923
01:17:33,252 --> 01:17:35,618
- What is that?
- What do you think it is?

924
01:17:35,988 --> 01:17:37,922
You'll probably end up
shooting one of us.

925
01:17:38,090 --> 01:17:40,820
- Thank you for the vote of confidence.
- Just being realistic.

926
01:17:40,993 --> 01:17:43,757
You, realistic? Please, that's a first.

927
01:17:43,930 --> 01:17:46,694
- You shooting a gun, that's a first.
- Excuse me, I'm sorry.

928
01:17:46,866 --> 01:17:50,199
Can we just stick
to robbing the train? Okay.

929
01:17:54,207 --> 01:17:58,041
Well, if it don't smell like supper in here,
my damn nose is broke.

930
01:18:00,213 --> 01:18:02,511
Oh, my, my. Is those black beans?

931
01:18:42,321 --> 01:18:45,051
- Where's the governor?
- He's out stretching his legs.

932
01:18:45,224 --> 01:18:46,919
What do you mean, stretching his legs?

933
01:18:47,093 --> 01:18:49,254
- Well, I guess he fell off the train.
- Daddy?

934
01:18:49,428 --> 01:18:51,123
- What's going on here?
- Look, Mr. Ashe.

935
01:18:51,297 --> 01:18:53,765
We had 60 days
to get those railroads locked up.

936
01:18:53,933 --> 01:18:57,630
When I saw that, because of the problems
those two bitches have been causing...

937
01:18:57,803 --> 01:19:00,738
...we were gonna lose
that window of opportunity, I decided...

938
01:19:00,907 --> 01:19:04,536
...why not take advantage of the situation
while it was there?

939
01:19:04,710 --> 01:19:08,544
- You're stealing the gold.
- Yes, sir, I am.

940
01:19:08,714 --> 01:19:11,774
- You stop this train right now.
- No, sir, I won't.

941
01:19:11,951 --> 01:19:15,216
I am not in the thieving business.
I will have no part of this.

942
01:19:15,388 --> 01:19:18,482
I don't believe that any part of this
was ever offered to you.

943
01:19:19,258 --> 01:19:20,816
- God.
- No one move.

944
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:22,622
- Hands up.
- Daddy.

945
01:19:22,795 --> 01:19:24,319
Don't move.

946
01:19:25,364 --> 01:19:27,264
Turn around.

947
01:19:27,433 --> 01:19:29,458
- Are you okay?
- Now, see here.

948
01:19:29,635 --> 01:19:31,694
I said, turn around.

949
01:19:31,871 --> 01:19:34,704
You, drop the gun.

950
01:19:35,174 --> 01:19:37,665
Boy, you two are sure playing
a losing hand here.

951
01:19:37,843 --> 01:19:40,004
I got men all over this goddamn train.

952
01:19:40,179 --> 01:19:41,806
Guess again.

953
01:19:43,282 --> 01:19:46,183
- You won't get away with this.
- You're the one not getting away.

954
01:19:46,619 --> 01:19:49,144
Killing and robbing our people
in the name of your bank.

955
01:19:49,322 --> 01:19:52,257
- What is she talking about?
- He murdered my father.

956
01:19:53,025 --> 01:19:54,515
You ain't got no proof of that.

957
01:19:54,694 --> 01:19:56,628
We have fingerprints,
we have litmus paper.

958
01:19:56,796 --> 01:19:58,423
We have a microscope.

959
01:19:58,598 --> 01:20:00,293
What are you two going on about?

960
01:20:00,466 --> 01:20:01,933
The scientific method.

961
01:20:02,301 --> 01:20:03,859
Quentin?

962
01:20:05,605 --> 01:20:09,405
- Quentin.
- What are you doing here?

963
01:20:09,575 --> 01:20:11,600
What the hell are you doing here?

964
01:21:02,862 --> 01:21:04,193
Get out of my way.

965
01:21:06,232 --> 01:21:08,860
- Quentin.
- What are you doing? Come on, come on.

966
01:21:09,035 --> 01:21:10,662
He shot you.

967
01:21:25,985 --> 01:21:28,317
No hablo Spanish.

968
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,399
Goddamn it.

969
01:22:14,133 --> 01:22:17,432
Hey, where are you going?
You're gonna let him get away.

970
01:22:29,682 --> 01:22:32,116
- You think he's dead?
- Lf he's not, he will be.

971
01:22:32,852 --> 01:22:36,413
- Maybe we should hold him for the law.
- What? He killed your father.

972
01:22:36,589 --> 01:22:37,817
I know.

973
01:22:37,990 --> 01:22:41,118
I wanna kill him, I dream of killing him.

974
01:22:41,761 --> 01:22:45,697
But if I do,
that makes me no better than him.

975
01:22:46,265 --> 01:22:47,926
Maria...

976
01:22:50,469 --> 01:22:52,164
...I don't think I can kill a man.

977
01:22:55,241 --> 01:22:56,902
Me neither.

978
01:23:00,446 --> 01:23:03,313
- But I'm going to anyway.
- Maybe just wound him.

979
01:23:05,718 --> 01:23:07,709
Think this is gonna give me
a bad reputation?

980
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:10,054
- Shooting people?
- No...

981
01:23:10,222 --> 01:23:13,191
...I think it would just add
to your legend.

982
01:23:13,893 --> 01:23:16,088
I have a legend?

983
01:23:16,629 --> 01:23:17,721
Of course we do.

984
01:23:27,907 --> 01:23:29,465
Always count your bullets.

985
01:23:57,636 --> 01:24:00,833
He was enlisted to help us uncover
the real bandido.

986
01:24:01,006 --> 01:24:04,533
- He helped fix our country.
- So we honor him...

987
01:24:04,710 --> 01:24:07,543
...for bravery above and beyond
the call of duty...

988
01:24:07,713 --> 01:24:10,648
...and for the service he has done
for the people of Mexico.

989
01:24:10,816 --> 01:24:14,047
And for helping to bring
our people together.

990
01:24:14,220 --> 01:24:15,881
I'm gonna miss you.

991
01:24:21,727 --> 01:24:23,661
I'm going to miss you.

992
01:24:34,173 --> 01:24:38,803
Quentin, I, too, wish to express
my appreciation. Now, if you please...

993
01:24:38,978 --> 01:24:40,673
...get on the train.

994
01:24:43,749 --> 01:24:45,011
I...

995
01:24:45,918 --> 01:24:47,476
...better go.

996
01:24:59,331 --> 01:25:02,459
Oh, Quentin.
I can't believe you made it all work out.

997
01:25:02,635 --> 01:25:05,103
I'm so happy.

998
01:25:24,156 --> 01:25:26,784
She's not a very good kisser.

999
01:25:26,959 --> 01:25:28,449
Well, she is.

1000
01:25:28,627 --> 01:25:31,528
But you're much better. Much better.

1001
01:25:38,103 --> 01:25:40,435
I can't believe the way
he was teasing her.

1002
01:25:40,606 --> 01:25:43,871
So insincere, such a liar.

1003
01:25:44,043 --> 01:25:47,069
Telling me my kiss was perfect,
then telling you.

1004
01:25:47,246 --> 01:25:49,612
I'm sure he's telling her the same thing.

1005
01:25:50,015 --> 01:25:51,983
What do you think?

1006
01:25:53,018 --> 01:25:54,679
- Sara.
- What?

1007
01:25:54,853 --> 01:25:57,822
Don't you think it's obvious
that he doesn't love her?

1008
01:25:57,990 --> 01:26:00,288
Is that why you woke me up?

1009
01:26:00,726 --> 01:26:02,660
I was finally having such a nice sleep.

1010
01:26:02,828 --> 01:26:06,958
At least you can sleep. I never
had trouble sleeping before I met you.

1011
01:26:07,132 --> 01:26:08,656
Now I can't stop thinking.

1012
01:26:08,834 --> 01:26:12,201
You should be very grateful
that now your brain is thinking.

1013
01:26:12,838 --> 01:26:15,568
Would you please be quiet
so I can at least enjoy the sunset?

1014
01:26:16,675 --> 01:26:18,302
You've never seen a sunset before?

1015
01:26:18,844 --> 01:26:20,641
It's just that this sunset reminds me...

1016
01:26:20,813 --> 01:26:23,748
...of a particularly beautiful one
I saw in Câdiz.

1017
01:26:25,184 --> 01:26:27,379
- Where is that?
- Câdiz?

1018
01:26:28,253 --> 01:26:30,244
In Europe.

1019
01:26:30,422 --> 01:26:34,290
- Can I ask you one more thing?
- One more.

1020
01:26:35,894 --> 01:26:38,385
How are the banks in Europe?

1021
01:26:43,869 --> 01:26:45,336
Bigger.

1022
01:32:05,991 --> 01:32:07,982
