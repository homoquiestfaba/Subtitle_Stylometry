boy has dreamt about.

355
00:24:40,745 --> 00:24:43,281
Let's give the public
what it wants.

356
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:45,283
Of course,
if your erector set here can't handle it the job,

357
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:48,253
- i understand.
- Zach, evolver can do it.

358
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:49,621

There's no
hot water.

366
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:31,196
You guys, clean up

00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,764
Where are my jeans?

368
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:34,833
Unbelievable.

Lansky, is that you?

379
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,299

What?
What, you got some more for me?

394

Enemy 5--

405
00:30:14,445 --> 00:30:17,816
No, this is taking much too long.
I'm going in.

406
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,517
No, no, wait.
Just give him some more time.

407
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:21,486
He can do it.

408
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:24,255
Yeah, and what if
he's blown our cover?

409
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:27,492
No. I'm going in.

410
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:30,361
Evolver ready
to play again.

411
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:32,230
You the man, baxter.

412
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,232
What happened
to the cart?

413
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:35,533
Who cares?

414
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,206
O.k., evo,
cough up the disk.

415
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:43,074
You hear what
the guy said?

416
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:44,342
You got to wait
till it's full.

417
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:46,311
How long will that take?

418
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:48,213
I don't know.
Maybe a couple of days.

419
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:50,315
Oh, fuck that noise.
Let's get the damn thing out now.

420
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:54,085
No! I don't want to risk screwing this thing up,
all right?

421
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:55,553
Let's get out of here
before we get caught.

422
00:30:55,553 --> 00:30:57,388
Come on.

423
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:02,493
Chuck, just check
the numbers.

424
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:04,629
I know about that.

425
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:06,364
I know. You keep
telling me that,

426
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:10,168
but i just don't understand
the problem. I'm sorry.

427
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:12,170
Yes, i know the house.

428
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:16,241
Look, just fax me
the information, o.k.?

429
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:18,176
It's really easier
for me to do it here.

430
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:20,044
I got a hostage!

431
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:21,679
Back off, or
the bitch dies!

432
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,083
[Over bullhorn] let her go, johnson.
We won't hurt you.

433
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:27,518
Easy, or i'll cut
your fucking throat!

434
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:30,121
O.k., chuck. I'll
talk to you tomorrow.

435
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,563
[Melanie]
this is good, honey.

436
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:41,266
It's a tv dinner,
mother.

437
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:45,336
- Weapon?
- This? It's a knife, jerk brain.

438
00:31:45,336 --> 00:31:47,572
You cut food
with it.

439
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:50,341
I thought this thing
was supposed to be smart.

440
00:31:50,341 --> 00:31:52,243
What a gyp.

441
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,512
I swear, i'll cut
your fucking throat.

442
00:31:57,081 --> 00:32:00,652
- What did he just say?
- Back off, or the bitch dies.

443
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,489
He's just watching
too much cable, mom.

444
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:07,358
You think that's funny?
I don't find that funny, kyle.

445
00:32:07,358 --> 00:32:09,527
[Doorbell chimes]

446
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:11,362
it's probably for me.
I'll get it.

447
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:14,098
No, you stop-- i want you to call that man that brought him.

448
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:17,168
I don't want this thing talking like that in my house!

449
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:19,170
Jerk brain.

450
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:25,276
Do you always have your machines do your dirty work?

451
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,612
I don't know what
you're talking about.

452
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:30,348
Oh, come on, kyle.
I was in the locker room.

453
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:33,051
I saw it.
And shame on you for corrupting

454
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:35,186
a poor little
innocent robot.

455
00:32:35,186 --> 00:32:37,088
I guess i was
trying to teach him

456
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:38,456
how to explore
new worlds.

457
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:41,559
I hope you know
how disgusting you are.

458
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:44,095
[Melanie] kyle,
your food's getting cold.

459
00:32:44,095 --> 00:32:47,465
You want to talk about
this somewhere else?

460
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:49,334
Yes, i do.

461
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:55,139
Whoa, nice place...

462
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:57,508
if you're a bat.

463
00:32:57,508 --> 00:33:01,079
- Works for me.
- Kyle, i liked you,

464
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:02,380
and i thought we
could be friends,

465
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,515
but after this stupid,
cheesy, immoral--

466
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:06,451
o.k. it was
a dumb idea.

467
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:09,053
- What do you want from me?
- I want the disk.

468
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:11,089
Well, it's still
in evolver.

469
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:12,690
It not gonna come out
until it's full.

470
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:16,060
Then you and zach can fight over it,
or whatever.

471
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,495
Zach.

472
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:21,065
I should have known that low-life sleaze was involved.

473
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:24,202
That happens to be
my favorite sleaze.

474
00:33:26,604 --> 00:33:28,439
So, i hear you're
in the club, too.

475
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:32,510
What club?

476
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,545
The divorced kids
of america.

477
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:36,547
I'm a charter member.

478
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:40,051
My dad wanted a change,
so we moved out here.

479
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:42,353
So anytime i want
to see my mom,

480
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:44,188
i have to fly to ohio.

481
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,190
It really stinks.

482
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:49,360
Yeah, tell me
about it.

483
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,296
Jeez, kyle. If you're
so interested in girls,

484
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:54,599
why not try
asking one out?

485
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:00,405
Do you have one in mind?

486
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:06,110
- Want to play?
- No.

487
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,545
Maybe later.

488
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,213
Um... get out
of my room.

489
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,522
I think you hurt
his feelings.

490
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:19,557
I don't think so.

491
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:21,626
See, computers...

492
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:24,462
they don't
have feelings.

493
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:28,366
Is that why you
like them?

494
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:31,069
Computers, you know,
they're not like people.

495
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,304
People will
let you down.

496
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:36,274
[Ali]
aah! Help, kyle!

497
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:39,377
Save me!

498
00:34:39,377 --> 00:34:41,212
I dropped
my laser gun.

499
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:44,615
Play now, or hostage
will be eliminated.

500
00:34:44,615 --> 00:34:47,285
I guess i did
hurt his feelings.

501
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:49,520
You want to go
for another game?

502
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,257
- Do i have a choice?
- Ah ha ha ha ha!

503
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:55,793
Hostage escape!
Hostage escape!

504
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:02,300
Come on.

505
00:35:03,901 --> 00:35:06,370
- Ah!
- [Laser shots]

506
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:14,545
o.k. we're all going
to split up, all right?

507
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:16,447
[Jamie]
hey, what's that?

508
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,382
It's got
a smoke screen?

509
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:20,618
[All coughing]

510
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:27,391
evolver-- 25 damage points.
- Gotcha.

511
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:46,744
Enemy 1-- eliminate.

512
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:11,569
- [Fires]
- bull's-eye.

513
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:14,705
Evolver defeated on second level.
Congratulations.

514
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:18,376
What happened?

515
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:20,678
He broke
the mirror.

516
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:23,247
This thing
is destroying my house.

517
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:25,383
- Kyle did it!
- Mom, i--

518
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:27,418
just clean it up
before anyone gets hurt.

519
00:36:27,418 --> 00:36:30,388
Oh, i should never
have agreed to this.

520
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:32,490
Go get
a trash can.

521
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:39,530
Enemy 1, you win again.

522
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,432
500 points.

523
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:52,577
- What is that?
- It's a ball bearing.

524
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:54,745
It must have
accidentally

525
00:36:54,745 --> 00:36:57,548
sucked it up
from my room.

526
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,217
Interesting design glitch.

527
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,985
Advancing to next level.

528
00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:23,574
Impressive, heh.

529
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:28,479
Welcome to level 3.
Resume game?

530
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:32,350
There's nothing
wrong here.

531
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:34,285
[Ali]
hey, kyle!

532
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,990
Yeah,
what is it?

533
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:41,959
Earlier there was an accident
at a local high school.

534
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:44,362
A 17-year-old student
was found dead,

535
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:46,397
the result of
a broken neck.

536
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:47,965
That's dwight!

537
00:37:47,965 --> 00:37:50,601
He was found by a janitor around 4:45.

538
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:53,371
That was right
after practice.

539
00:37:53,371 --> 00:37:54,739
Did you notice
anything?

540
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:56,941
- No. What about you?
- No.

541
00:37:56,941 --> 00:38:02,079
- Play again?
- No.

542
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,415
As of this time,
school officials

543
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:06,584
and the police department
are calling it

544
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:09,387
a very tragic accident.

545
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,524
You're not a robot,
russell.

546
00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:15,726
Humans need sleep.

547
00:38:16,927 --> 00:38:19,497
- Good night.
- Night.

548
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:48,392
[Kyle] i don't see why you're so paranoid.

549
00:38:48,392 --> 00:38:50,061
[Jamie] something's wrong, kyle.
I just want to take a look.

550
00:38:50,061 --> 00:38:52,463
You just want to see
a bunch of naked boys.

551
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:55,433
No, i think that's
more your style.

552
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:57,435
You're not seriously
going in there, are you?

553
00:38:57,435 --> 00:39:00,471
Watch me.
P.e. doesn't start for half an hour.

554
00:39:03,407 --> 00:39:05,042
I don't know what you're planning on finding here.

555
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:06,510
I don't either.

556
00:39:10,147 --> 00:39:12,616
One of those metal balls
could've done this.

557
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:15,419
Anything could've
done that.

558
00:39:15,419 --> 00:39:17,521
Computers only do what they're programmed to do,

559
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:19,590
and evolver was programmed to play games,

560
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:21,525
and that's all.

561
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,394
Maybe.

562
00:39:39,009 --> 00:39:41,445
[Electrical crackling]

563
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:20,418
hello?

564
00:40:22,486 --> 00:40:25,489
Evolver?

565
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:27,525
Yo, evo baby,
where you hiding?

566
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:29,627
Come on, we're going
for a ride.

567
00:40:32,496 --> 00:40:34,999
- Whoa!
- Want to play?

568
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:38,502
Not now, butty,
but i would love is that nifty little disk.

569
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:41,705
[Jerry]
evolver is a game.

570
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:43,007
It's supposed to be fun.

571
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:44,442
What i saw was not fun.

572
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,243
Jerry, that little girl

573
00:40:46,243 --> 00:40:48,245
was a lot younger than
the target age group.

574
00:40:48,245 --> 00:40:50,481
You know that.
I mean, she wasn't hurt.

575
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:52,583
She was just a little
frustrated, that's all.

576
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:54,618
Terror-stricken
is more like it.

577
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:57,588
Russell, i'm not convinced
that evolver is ready.

578
00:40:57,588 --> 00:41:00,991
The last thing i need from santa this christmas is a major lawsuit.

579
00:41:00,991 --> 00:41:03,160
Evolver was designed
as a tough adversary.

580
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,262
That's what makes him special.
That's what you wanted.

581
00:41:05,262 --> 00:41:08,098
I wanted a techno-toy
that kids would play with,

582
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:11,001
but this toy acts like
it's playing for keeps.

583
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:13,137
All right, fine,
i'll pull evolver,

584
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:15,105
and i'll retest
the entire program,

585
00:41:15,105 --> 00:41:17,007
but it will cost you
eight months.

586
00:41:17,007 --> 00:41:19,577
If i do,
the only thing you'll get from santa this christmas

587
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:22,179
is a lump of coal.

588
00:41:34,124 --> 00:41:36,126
We have arrived, evo.

589
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:59,650
O.k. a little minor surgery,
no problem.

590
00:42:04,221 --> 00:42:07,691
Shit.
This is harder than getting into mary anne wilkin's pants.

591
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:16,700
Come on, baby.

592
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:20,671
Just a little more.
Yes.

593
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:27,344
What the hell.
As long as there's faces and tits.

594
00:42:35,653 --> 00:42:38,355
Clancy. Yeah. It's me.
We're in business.

595
00:42:38,355 --> 00:42:40,291
Yeah. I got it.

596
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:42,793
The entire girls' volleyball team in living color.

597
00:42:42,793 --> 00:42:44,361
No. No one saw us.

598
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:47,197
You're sure you can
print these things out?

599
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:49,300
All right. What?

600
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,569
15 %? No. No. No.

601
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:54,138
I'm not going to discuss it on the phone.

602
00:42:54,138 --> 00:42:55,639
We'll talk when
i get to your house.

603
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:58,776
Clancy, just trust me,
all right?

604
00:42:58,776 --> 00:43:01,245
I got to get rid
of this thing at kyle's,

605
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:04,081
and i'll be over.
All right.

606
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:06,016
Fire up your computer,
bro.

607
00:43:06,016 --> 00:43:08,018
All right.
See you.

608
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:16,193
Evo!

609
00:43:18,028 --> 00:43:19,730
Did i turn him on?

610
00:43:22,066 --> 00:43:25,135
Hey, evo. Come on.
Come to uncle zach.

611
00:43:25,135 --> 00:43:27,605
Enemy 2.
Let's play.

612
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:30,641
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

613
00:43:30,641 --> 00:43:33,010
You're off?

614
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:34,244
Aah!

615
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:39,383
Enemy 2.
20 damage points.

616
00:44:22,226 --> 00:44:24,361
Game over.

617
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:26,363
No!

618
00:44:37,374 --> 00:44:40,110
Enemy 2.
Kill confirmed.

619
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:42,746
Evolver wins again.

620
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:46,717
Return to home base.

621
00:44:52,256 --> 00:44:54,491
Where is he?

622
00:44:54,491 --> 00:44:56,026
I've looked everywhere
for him.

623
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:57,461
I don't know.
He's not in here.

624
00:44:57,461 --> 00:44:59,296
Can he open doors now?

625
00:44:59,296 --> 00:45:01,732
Maybe he decided
to take a stroll

626
00:45:01,732 --> 00:45:04,168
down to the computer store
and get himself some new disks.

627
00:45:04,168 --> 00:45:07,337
Disks.
I smell a zach.

628
00:45:07,337 --> 00:45:09,073
Come on.

629
00:45:23,787 --> 00:45:26,056
Shit, man.

630
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:29,093
That little fucker
is fast!

631
00:45:29,093 --> 00:45:31,295
No, man, he ain't fast.
You just stoned.

632
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:33,263
Here. Give me that.

633
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:37,501
To the right!
To the right!

634
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:55,786
Play?
Let's play.

635
00:45:59,223 --> 00:46:01,492
[Players laughing]

636
00:46:08,198 --> 00:46:10,801
turboplay will be
closing in 10 minutes.

637
00:46:10,801 --> 00:46:13,137
Shit! You'll never
get out of level 1.

638
00:46:13,137 --> 00:46:14,571
Let's go, man.

639
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:19,309
Yo, ace.
It's the robot.

640
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:21,011
Tell me about it.

641
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:22,179
Play with me.

642
00:46:22,179 --> 00:46:24,214
Oh, man.
This is too intense.

643
00:46:24,214 --> 00:46:25,816
I must be hallucinating.

644
00:46:25,816 --> 00:46:27,785
Recording players.

645
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:30,487
Enemy 6.
Enemy 7.

646
00:46:30,487 --> 00:46:33,023
Yeah, man.
I'm enemy 7!

647
00:46:33,023 --> 00:46:35,425
Give me some skin.

648
00:46:35,425 --> 00:46:37,327
Let's play.

649
00:46:37,327 --> 00:46:39,029
Ah! Aah! Aaah!

650
00:46:39,029 --> 00:46:40,597
Aaaah!

651
00:46:47,104 --> 00:46:50,140
Evolver defeated.
- Ah! Ha ha ha!

652
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,075
Tiny! Tiny, man!
Did you see that?

653
00:46:52,075 --> 00:46:55,412
I killed the little prick.
Ha ha ha ha!

654
00:46:55,412 --> 00:46:58,816
Tiny. Tiny,
you still watching?

655
00:47:06,423 --> 00:47:10,327
Ah, come on,
you little sucker.

656
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:12,629
Ha! Where are you hiding?

657
00:47:21,605 --> 00:47:24,842
Whoa!
What the fuck?

658
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:26,343
Cool!

659
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:28,545
This must be
the next level.

660
00:47:28,545 --> 00:47:30,113
Ha ha ha ha.

661
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:34,184
Whoa. Cool!

662
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:36,587
Tiny, man,
you seeing this?

663
00:47:38,622 --> 00:47:42,226
- Ready to play?
- Absolutely.

664
00:47:42,226 --> 00:47:44,161
Go ahead.
Hurt me.

665
00:47:44,161 --> 00:47:45,562
[Laughing]

666
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:51,335
shit. I guess
the fucking game's over.

667
00:47:51,335 --> 00:47:52,870
Not yet.

668
00:47:59,142 --> 00:48:00,410
Aah!

669
00:48:10,687 --> 00:48:12,689
Now it's over.

670
00:48:25,469 --> 00:48:27,204
What's going on?

671
00:48:34,044 --> 00:48:37,047
- What happened?
- The boy was fooling around in the garage,

672
00:48:37,047 --> 00:48:38,682
- and the car fell on him.
- Zach?

673
00:48:38,682 --> 00:48:40,284
Is he going
to be o.k.?

674
00:48:40,284 --> 00:48:43,086
It's too soon to tell.
Step back.

675
00:48:45,355 --> 00:48:48,191
- Mrs. Renzetti.
- Kyle.

676
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:50,360
How could this happen?

677
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,429
How? How?

678
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:15,085
He must've brought him
over here.

679
00:49:18,255 --> 00:49:21,491
This is getting
too weird.

680
00:49:21,491 --> 00:49:23,694
I got to go
find evolver.

681
00:49:27,097 --> 00:49:28,265
I'll go with you.

682
00:49:28,265 --> 00:49:30,233
No.
I'm taking you home.

683
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:32,602
I know you're upset
about zach.

684
00:49:34,571 --> 00:49:36,406
You know, when someone
tries to reach out to you,

685
00:49:36,406 --> 00:49:38,275
it wouldn't hurt
to let them in a little.

686
00:49:38,275 --> 00:49:41,144
Why don't you cut the therapist crap,
all right?

687
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:43,080
Jeez.

688
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:46,350
You act like you're my girlfriend or something.

689
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:48,318
Right. I forgot.

690
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:50,420
You only date computers.

691
00:50:05,235 --> 00:50:07,204
Ali.

692
00:50:07,204 --> 00:50:08,372
Ali!

693
00:50:08,372 --> 00:50:10,340
- Hey, ali!
- What?

694
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:11,508
Have you seen evolver?

695
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:13,210
He's right there.

696
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:15,278
Where the hell
have you been?

697
00:50:15,278 --> 00:50:18,081
Enemy 1.
Play with me.

698
00:50:25,555 --> 00:50:27,624
- Want to play?
- [Shuts off]

699
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,655
shit.

700
00:51:04,361 --> 00:51:06,730
You only do what you're programmed to do, huh?

701
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:13,070
So you think evolver
had something to do

702
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:14,471
with your friend's accident.

703
00:51:14,471 --> 00:51:17,107
I don't think
it was an accident.

704
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:20,077
The guy that was killed at my school,
i don't think that was an accident either.

705
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:23,080
What i'm trying
to tell you is,

706
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:26,283
i think there's something wrong with evolver.

707
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:33,090
- Where is he now?
- He's at my house.

708
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:36,259
- I took the batteries out.
- Well, that was good thinking.

709
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:38,428
Why don't you
give me the disk?

710
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:40,097
I'll run it through
a recapture program,

711
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:42,165
but you might as well
wait at home.

712
00:51:42,165 --> 00:51:45,368
If you're right,
i'll send a crew and pick him up.

713
00:51:45,368 --> 00:51:47,137
What about right now?

714
00:51:47,137 --> 00:51:51,208
If this disk shows
evolver was not at fault,

715
00:51:51,208 --> 00:51:53,276
you can continue
to have fun with him.

716
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:55,112
It hasn't exactly
been fun.

717
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:58,215
I don't think you don't get
how dangerous this could be.

718
00:51:58,215 --> 00:52:00,917
Look, kyle,
i don't think you don't get that i created evolver.

719
00:52:00,917 --> 00:52:03,420
I know how he thinks,
what makes him tick, and you don't.

720
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:06,189
So please, go home.
Let me look at the disk.

721
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:20,370
- Does this have anything to do with s.w.o.r.d.?
- S.w.o.r.d.?

722
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:23,940
It was something i found in his programming.
It wasn't in the manual, so i--

723
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:26,376
s.w.o.r.d.'s a game i've been working on,
that's all.

724
00:52:26,376 --> 00:52:29,946
It's fine.
I will take care of it.

725
00:52:29,946 --> 00:52:32,182
I'll call after
i look at the disk.

726
00:52:32,182 --> 00:52:33,617
All right?

727
00:52:33,617 --> 00:52:35,152
Yeah.

728
00:52:54,638 --> 00:52:56,973
Hi. I'm looking
for kyle baxter.

729
00:52:56,973 --> 00:52:59,576
He might be seeing
russell bennett.

730
00:52:59,576 --> 00:53:01,378
- I'll check.
- O.k. thanks.

731
00:53:04,548 --> 00:53:06,950
Hi. It's phyllis.
I'm looking for dr. Bennett.

732
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:09,419
There's someone
here to see him.

733
00:53:09,419 --> 00:53:11,755
Could you check for me?

734
00:53:17,394 --> 00:53:21,464
- [Beep]
- what are you doing here?

735
00:53:21,464 --> 00:53:23,466
Let's talk about it
inside. Come on.

736
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:32,242
I called your house
this morning.

737
00:53:32,242 --> 00:53:34,611
Ali told me
where you were.

738
00:53:34,611 --> 00:53:36,646
Blabbermouth.

739
00:53:36,646 --> 00:53:39,449
I heard zach's
going to pull through.

740
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:45,388
Look, um...

741
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:47,691
about what i said
last night...

742
00:53:47,691 --> 00:53:49,626
you know,
over at zach's house...

743
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:51,995
i'm sorry.

744
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:56,566
It's all right.
Forget about it.

745
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:59,569
[Tries locked door handle]

746
00:54:02,672 --> 00:54:04,941
so what are you
looking for, sherlock?

747
00:54:04,941 --> 00:54:08,278
Well...

748
00:54:08,278 --> 00:54:11,248
looks like our nice
little mr. Bennett

749
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:13,683
is hiding something
from us.

750
00:54:13,683 --> 00:54:15,585
Let's see.

751
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:27,364
"Sword"?
What's that?

752
00:54:27,364 --> 00:54:29,633
Something i found
in the program.

753
00:54:29,633 --> 00:54:32,402
Wasn't really
supposed to find it.

754
00:54:32,402 --> 00:54:34,371
What is all that stuff?

755
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:40,076
Strategic war oriented
robotic device?

756
00:54:40,076 --> 00:54:43,446
Whatever it is,
it's definitely not a game.

757
00:54:51,087 --> 00:54:53,089
"Napalm charged
grenade launcher."

758
00:54:53,089 --> 00:54:55,492
This thing is
a killing machine.

759
00:54:58,061 --> 00:55:00,430
"Sole design

761
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:15,478
that's bennett.

762
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:20,350
"Project terminated
8/15/89."

763
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:22,619
Why do you think
it was terminated?

764
00:55:28,391 --> 00:55:30,760
It's found the target.
It's just ahead.

765
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:32,462
Come on.
Come on, let's move.

766
00:55:35,098 --> 00:55:37,067
There he is!

767
00:55:37,067 --> 00:55:39,536

768
00:55:39,536 --> 00:55:41,504
no! It's out of control!

769
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:44,441
It's freaking!
It's freaking!

770
00:55:44,441 --> 00:55:45,742
Take cover!

771
00:55:45,742 --> 00:55:47,377

772
00:55:47,377 --> 00:55:48,645
no!

773
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:53,416

776
00:56:07,163 --> 00:56:08,998
It's over.

777
00:56:14,971 --> 00:56:16,706
When they scrapped
the military program,

778
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:19,943
i guess they must've
adapted it to put in evolver.

779
00:56:19,943 --> 00:56:22,679
I don't think
they adapted it enough.

780
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:26,082
Kyle, where's evolver
right now?

781
00:56:26,082 --> 00:56:28,485
Ali's still at home
with it. Come on!

782
00:56:30,186 --> 00:56:32,489
- Do you have a quarter?
- Yeah.

783
00:56:38,161 --> 00:56:40,163

- baxter residence, ali speaking.
- Ali, are you o.k.?

786
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:53,543
- Of course i'm all right. Why?
- Where's mom?

787
00:56:53,543 --> 00:56:55,445
She had to close
an escrow.

788
00:56:55,445 --> 00:56:57,680
The prime lending rate
just jumped--

789
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:00,750
- is evolver still in my bedroom?
- No.

790
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:02,585
What do you mean "no?"
Where is he?

791
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:05,555
I'm playing with him.
I put back the batteries.

792
00:57:05,555 --> 00:57:08,525
- Why did you take them out?
- No! Don't do that!

793
00:57:08,525 --> 00:57:11,661
- Got to go. I'm playing.
- Ali!

Evolver,
come and get me!

795
00:57:22,572 --> 00:57:24,841
Ready?
Let's play.

796
00:57:56,606 --> 00:57:58,508
No.

God...

798
00:58:03,112 --> 00:58:05,515
damn you.

- Ali!
- Help! I'm sinking!

01:00:18,348 --> 01:00:20,316
- Get her out of the pool!
- Hold on, ali!

enemy number 1!

- Play with me! Ali!

01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:05,428
I don't think so.

829
01:01:39,996 --> 01:01:43,099
Uh... i don't really know where to start.

830
01:01:43,099 --> 01:01:45,802
Um, look...

831
01:01:45,802 --> 01:01:49,706
this project began
as a way to save lives--

832
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:51,808
soldiers' lives.

833
01:01:51,808 --> 01:01:54,777
I never intended
for this happen.

834
01:01:54,777 --> 01:01:56,779
I'm sorry.
I just wanted to prove

835
01:01:56,779 --> 01:01:59,082
that the program
would work.

836
01:02:01,751 --> 01:02:04,087
That thing almost
killed my sister.

01:02:04,087 --> 01:02:06,289
One kid's dead and the other's in the hospital!

838
01:02:06,289 --> 01:02:08,491
And all you can say
is "i'm sorry"?

839
01:02:08,491 --> 01:02:10,326
What is that, man, huh?

840
01:02:10,326 --> 01:02:13,062
Kyle, come on. The courts
will take care of this.

841
01:02:16,466 --> 01:02:20,436
I hope your attorneys are better than your technicians,
mr. Bennett.

842
01:02:20,436 --> 01:02:22,772
Well, if it's
any consolation,

843
01:02:22,772 --> 01:02:26,042
evolver will be
destroyed.

844
01:02:34,183 --> 01:02:37,053
- Kyle, i'll be out front, o.k.?
- Yeah.

845
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:46,362
This isn't your fault,
you know.

846
01:02:46,362 --> 01:02:49,065
You couldn't have known all this was going to happen.

847
01:02:52,502 --> 01:02:54,837
I guess i should've realized it sooner,
you know.

848
01:02:57,306 --> 01:02:59,375
I didn't want to.

849
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:02,779
Yeah, i know.

850
01:03:05,047 --> 01:03:08,384
I should've realized something sooner, too,
you know.

851
01:03:10,052 --> 01:03:12,054
I've been gone a lot.

852
01:03:12,054 --> 01:03:16,058

to be a family again.

853
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:19,529
That be o.k. with you?

854
01:03:19,529 --> 01:03:22,298
Yeah. Definitely.

855
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:23,866
- You sure?
- Yeah, of course.

856
01:03:46,389 --> 01:03:48,357
Come on.
I'll give you a ride home.

857
01:03:54,197 --> 01:03:56,232
Just a game.

01:03:56,232 --> 01:03:58,201

what went wrong.

Do you hear me?

872
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:20,650

your enemy.

886
01:07:11,127 --> 01:07:13,062
Been so busy,
i guess i forgot to check the tank.

887
01:07:13,062 --> 01:07:15,164
I guess i can forgive you
this time.

888
01:07:25,141 --> 01:07:27,543
I'll get some gas
tomorrow.

889
01:07:28,577 --> 01:07:32,114
Well, we better
get going.

890
01:07:32,114 --> 01:07:33,315
It's getting late.

891
01:07:33,315 --> 01:07:35,251
What's the big hurry?

892
01:07:35,251 --> 01:07:38,187
It's a long walk.
That's all.

893
01:07:38,187 --> 01:07:40,322
[Laughs]

894
01:07:40,322 --> 01:07:42,525
for a second there,

895
01:07:42,525 --> 01:07:45,361
i thought that
you did it on purpose.

896
01:07:45,361 --> 01:07:48,464
- Did what?
- You know.

897
01:07:48,464 --> 01:07:51,267
Ran out of gas.

898
01:07:51,267 --> 01:07:54,437
I guess that's not
your style, huh?

899
01:07:54,437 --> 01:07:56,505
Guess not.

900
01:07:59,675 --> 01:08:01,477
But...

901
01:08:01,477 --> 01:08:04,246
i could make it
my style.

902
01:08:18,394 --> 01:08:20,196
So...
[laughs]

903
01:08:20,196 --> 01:08:22,198
what did you
think of that?

904
01:08:22,198 --> 01:08:24,667
I think i want
to do that some more.

905
01:09:04,607 --> 01:09:07,409
- Hey, what's that?
- I don't know.

906
01:09:09,378 --> 01:09:10,613
Wait a second.

907
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:16,619
That's
the cyber-tronix van!

908
01:09:17,953 --> 01:09:19,955
- Officer.
- Hey, behind the line.

909
01:09:19,955 --> 01:09:22,424
I think i know
what happened here.

910
01:09:22,424 --> 01:09:24,660
This robot and i think
might've done this.

911
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:27,563
A robot? Listen, kid,
i don't have time for this.

912
01:09:27,563 --> 01:09:29,398
No, wait!
You got to listen to me.

913
01:09:29,398 --> 01:09:32,568
That van was to cyber-tronix with the robot inside.

914
01:09:32,568 --> 01:09:35,304
He's killed people.
He might be loose.

915
01:09:35,304 --> 01:09:37,907
Aren't you going
to do something?

916
01:09:37,907 --> 01:09:40,576
Why don't you two
get down to the precinct,

917
01:09:40,576 --> 01:09:42,311
talk to the guy
behind the desk.

918
01:09:42,311 --> 01:09:44,213
Tell him what
you told me.

919
01:09:53,222 --> 01:09:54,757

Game continues.

953
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:26,542
Enemy 1 won't play.

954
01:12:26,542 --> 01:12:28,677
Then hostages
will be eliminated.

955
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:30,813
What hostages?

956
01:12:44,593 --> 01:12:47,029

You have three minutes
to win or i eliminate hostages.

960
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:57,005

01:13:55,230 --> 01:13:56,999
Probably the same way

971
01:13:56,999 --> 01:13:59,201
he got the fuck
up those stairs.

972
01:13:59,201 --> 01:14:01,737
- Ah, shit!
- Sorry.

973
01:14:08,777 --> 01:14:10,579
The line's dead.

going to do?

Got to get him away
from the stairs.

Now what?

983
01:15:21,149 --> 01:15:24,686
1 minute, 20 seconds

beat this thing.

What do you know about the evolver project?

1054
01:23:32,674 --> 01:23:34,342
Nothing, really.

1055
01:23:34,342 --> 01:23:36,044
Do you take full responsibility for evolver?

1056
01:23:36,044 --> 01:23:37,579
Are the people
