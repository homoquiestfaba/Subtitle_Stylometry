1
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:20,265
- I'm just gonna go tell her.
- No. No, I...

2
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,520
I wanna tell her myself.

3
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,482
She knows what it's
like for you to be away.

4
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,901
You've led explorations before.

5
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,654
Not for this long.
Six weeks at most.

6
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:36,508
- She's a resilient kid. She'll be fine.
- But this isn't supply transport.

7
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:38,325
Or a jump to Cyllene and back.

8
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:41,411
- It's a two-year run.
- I know. I know how long.

9
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:45,207
- Just go.
- It's hard.

10
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,126
I'll go. I'm just thinking
about what to say.

11
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:52,548
Say they're tripling your salary, which
is how we can afford to treat her.

12
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:57,177
- To cure her.
- You okay?

13
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,141
I'm fine.

14
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,228
It's two years...

15
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:11,775
I won't be here.

16
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,697
I know, but when you
get back, she will.

17
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,781
Dad!

18
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:19,324
I can't do it.

19
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:28,249
You okay?

20
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:30,127
Yeah, yeah.

21
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,295
Are you sure?

22
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:34,173
Dad, I just want you
to help me with this.

23
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:35,924
Here. Don't blow so hard.

24
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:39,303
- Just easy. A little gentle.
- I think my thumbs are too small.

25
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,680
Your thumbs are perfect.
You're just blowing too hard.

26
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,140
Here, watch me. Watch me.

27
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:47,978
Why are you so good at everything?
You make it look so easy.

28
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,022
It is easy. You just have
to know how to do it.

29
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:54,067
- Don't blow in, blow down.
- Okay.

30
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:01,115
This is you.

31
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:03,785
It isn't.

32
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:06,163
- Just blow a little gently.
- Okay.

33
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:10,000
Don't get frustrated. Try again.

34
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:29,102
It's okay. I know.

35
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:32,439
- What do you know?
- I know that you're leaving.

36
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:37,361
And I know it's 'cause of me.

37
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,489
No, it's not because
of you, it's for you.

38
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,084
So how long will you
be gone this time?

39
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:49,975

I'm the only survivor of a

Hey!

94
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:21,091
Stop!

95
00:23:02,508 --> 00:23:03,509
<i>What's your name?</i>

96
00:23:09,223 --> 00:23:10,224
Your name?

97
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:25,822
Okay. Let's find
out who you are.

98
00:23:29,952 --> 00:23:33,830
Passenger number 35.

99
00:23:36,542 --> 00:23:38,043
Your name must be Koa.

100
00:23:39,878 --> 00:23:40,878
It's okay.

101
00:23:42,214 --> 00:23:44,299
Here, let's look at this burn.

102
00:23:45,259 --> 00:23:48,303
Koa, my name is Mills. I
was the pilot of the ship.

103
00:23:48,846 --> 00:23:51,223
I was transporting you
home before we crashed.

104
00:23:52,182 --> 00:23:54,518
And you've been in
cryostasis for...

105
00:23:55,811 --> 00:23:56,812
a long time.

106
00:23:59,523 --> 00:24:03,110
The navigation system is gone. I don't
know where we are. It's uncharted.

107
00:24:05,153 --> 00:24:06,572
There is an escape vessel.

108
00:24:07,072 --> 00:24:08,866
But it's high above
in the mountains.

109
00:24:12,828 --> 00:24:14,872
That's our only chance to
get you off the planet.

110
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:19,585
There's something
alien out there...

111
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:24,715
that is dangerous.

112
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:28,927
You understand me, Koa?

113
00:24:29,011 --> 00:24:30,304
I mean, it's Koa?

114
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:38,270
What'd you say?

115
00:24:46,695 --> 00:24:47,863
What language is that?

116
00:24:53,619 --> 00:24:54,620
Well, I can't...

117
00:24:56,872 --> 00:24:58,916
I can't translate.
I don't understand.

118
00:24:58,999 --> 00:25:02,044
No, I don't understand.
I can't translate it.

119
00:25:02,127 --> 00:25:05,589
My translator's broken. Like
everything else on this damn ship.

120
00:25:13,722 --> 00:25:14,765
What is that, Kuu'ri?

121
00:25:15,265 --> 00:25:16,266
Pris'ka?

122
00:25:28,028 --> 00:25:29,029
Mountain.

123
00:25:30,656 --> 00:25:35,077
We... We must climb all the
way to the top of the mountain.

124
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,580
That's where the other
half of our ship is.

125
00:25:39,748 --> 00:25:40,748
Ship.

126
00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:43,001
Mountain? Do you
understand mountain?

127
00:25:43,085 --> 00:25:45,629
Escape vessel. Here's
an escape vessel.

128
00:25:45,712 --> 00:25:47,005
That's where we...

129
00:25:50,968 --> 00:25:52,261
Over here.

130
00:25:52,344 --> 00:25:53,804
That's how you leave.

131
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:57,099
- That's how you get home.
- Home.

132
00:25:58,392 --> 00:25:59,393
What?

133
00:26:01,061 --> 00:26:02,479
- Home.
- Yes.

134
00:26:12,865 --> 00:26:13,866
Home.

135
00:26:17,327 --> 00:26:18,579
What is it, your parents?

136
00:26:19,162 --> 00:26:20,163
Family?

137
00:26:23,584 --> 00:26:24,585
Family.

138
00:26:32,467 --> 00:26:34,136
On the top of the mountain.

139
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,811
That's what I'm trying to tell
you. On top of the mountain.

140
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,689
- Family.
- Yeah. They're here.

141
00:27:01,455 --> 00:27:05,042
Charter 3703. The daughter
of the Ona family is alive.

142
00:27:06,293 --> 00:27:09,087
<i>A child, maybe 9 years
old and in good health.</i>

143
00:27:10,214 --> 00:27:12,633
Her name is Koa, from
the upper territories,

144
00:27:12,716 --> 00:27:14,635
so we are unable to communicate.

145
00:27:15,219 --> 00:27:16,720
Her parents were passengers.

146
00:27:17,387 --> 00:27:18,388
<i>Both deceased.</i>

147
00:27:19,181 --> 00:27:22,434
<i>I'm taking her to an escape vessel
I've located some distance away.</i>

148
00:27:22,518 --> 00:27:23,810
<i>Send help.</i>

149
00:27:26,021 --> 00:27:27,689
<i>Sending distress signal.</i>

150
00:27:34,238 --> 00:27:37,824
<i>Yeah, that's a ship. Just like
the one you're driving for work.</i>

151
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:40,869
<i>Blast off!</i>

152
00:27:41,537 --> 00:27:43,330
<i>I made it. Can you believe it?</i>

153
00:27:43,872 --> 00:27:45,207
<i>School's been pretty fun.</i>

154
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:48,460
<i>I've been getting good grades,
and everything's been going well.</i>

155
00:27:53,632 --> 00:27:57,094
<i>I miss seeing you
'cause I love you.</i>

156
00:27:57,928 --> 00:28:01,348
<i>Hello. We have gotten
some amazing news.</i>

157
00:28:01,431 --> 00:28:04,726
<i>It's made me very happy 'cause
you have made it halfway.</i>

158
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:08,522
<i>Here is your
halfway celebration.</i>

159
00:28:11,817 --> 00:28:13,193
<i>I'm very proud on you...</i>

160
00:28:13,277 --> 00:28:16,655
<i>Proud of you. For
making it halfway.</i>

161
00:28:19,491 --> 00:28:20,492
<i>I think Mom told you,</i>

162
00:28:20,576 --> 00:28:24,913
<i>but there's just a little minor
problem going on with me, so...</i>

163
00:28:24,997 --> 00:28:27,958
<i>But it's actually really fun here
and I've met some nice people.</i>

164
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:33,213
<i>And they remind me of you because
you are my greatest friend, and...</i>

165
00:28:33,297 --> 00:28:35,382
<i>Hurry back, please.</i>

166
00:28:35,465 --> 00:28:36,466
<i>Speed it up.</i>

167
00:28:37,509 --> 00:28:39,344
<i>I really hate you right now.</i>

168
00:28:40,012 --> 00:28:42,347
<i>You don't even care about me.</i>

169
00:28:42,431 --> 00:28:44,016
<i>Just want you to know I...</i>

170
00:28:46,351 --> 00:28:47,603
<i>I love you.</i>

171
00:28:50,898 --> 00:28:53,358
<i>I'm so tired, Dad.</i>

172
00:28:55,068 --> 00:28:56,069
<i>I'm tired.</i>

173
00:28:56,153 --> 00:28:57,237
<i>I'm try...</i>

174
00:28:58,739 --> 00:28:59,740
All right, let's go.

175
00:29:01,658 --> 00:29:02,868
Let's go.

176
00:29:18,509 --> 00:29:19,593
<i>Stay with me.</i>

177
00:29:19,676 --> 00:29:23,138

Move.

182
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:48,121

00:35:32,633 --> 00:35:34,092
You have to listen to me.

198
00:35:36,345 --> 00:35:38,013
You're gonna get
yourself killed.

199
00:36:20,889 --> 00:36:21,932

00:48:06,595 --> 00:48:07,846
Why'd you take this?
