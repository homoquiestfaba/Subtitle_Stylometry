Something's wrong

She looks waxy and snotty,
and she threw up and wouldn't eat.

42
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:17,659
Oh, but that's a cat,
you know. Cats throw up
hair balls all the time.

43

I know, but I made
an appointment at the vet's
this morning anyway.

- Oh.

- [Chuckles]

53
00:03:45,824 --> 00:03:50,124
She should be put on a diet.
It's unhealthy for a cat
to be that fat.

You look at me.
You little cat.

She's always tellin' me
I smell bad.

61
00:04:12,818 --> 00:04:16,982
Ten seconds after I take
a shower, she tells me I stink!

62
00:04:17,055 --> 00:04:19,956
I can't help it if I stink
even when I'm clean.

63
00:04:20,025 --> 00:04:22,493
It just proves
it's not my fault.

64

Why do you think
she's always hurting your feelings?

65
00:04:25,464 --> 00:04:28,297
I don't know.
I don't think she likes me.

66
00:04:28,367 --> 00:04:30,426
She's your wife.
Let's assume she likes you.

67
00:04:30,502 --> 00:04:33,630
- But a lot of husbands and wives
don't like each other.
- That's true.

68
00:04:36,074 --> 00:04:40,306
I got this little voice
tellin' me she's mad at me,
but I don't know why.

69
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:42,347
A little voice?

70
00:04:42,414 --> 00:04:47,351
- What little voice?
- The voice of the devil.
I see him too.

71
00:04:50,055 --> 00:04:52,922
What... What... What does
the devil look like?

72
00:04:52,991 --> 00:04:55,221

I'm really proud of myself.

75
00:05:03,101 --> 00:05:06,161
You know why?
I never let myself be alone.

76

I always think I need to be
with somebody, but I don't.

77
00:05:08,507 --> 00:05:12,238
I mean, right after Carrie
I immediately met Debbie; right
after Debbie I was with you.

78
00:05:12,311 --> 00:05:16,247
And then I had that demented
relationship with that girl
in my group.

79
00:05:17,482 --> 00:05:19,575
It's not funny.

80
00:05:19,651 --> 00:05:23,087
I been talking on the phone
lately with this woman
I met in California.

81
00:05:23,155 --> 00:05:25,316
She's a bellhop.

82
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,790
I know. She likes me.

83
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,385
I mean, I can tell
she really likes me.

84
00:05:30,462 --> 00:05:33,693
But, uh, I just
want to be her friend.

85
00:05:33,765 --> 00:05:37,166
That's it, you know?
I'm not gonna let it evolve
into anything more.

86
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:39,966
It's not what I need
right now.

87
00:05:40,038 --> 00:05:43,769
Good. I think, you know, it'll
be really good for you to be
by yourself for a while.

00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:47,970
I have to hurry. I have
my Alzheimer's meeting
in a half an hour.

89
00:05:48,046 --> 00:05:50,446
All right. So, um, what
are you gonna do tonight?

90
00:05:50,515 --> 00:05:53,382
I rented some videos.
Probably just gonna watch them.

91

bong hits in the bathroom.

Yeah, but, honey, don't you
think you should at least try
to keep up your friendships?

107
00:06:47,205 --> 00:06:49,400
I mean, you know, you might
get sick of me one day,

Well, I've been doing
a lot of thinking lately,

that I think I want to,
um, end therapy.

00:09:27,599 --> 00:09:30,090

I just feel like it's time.
You know, I...

153
00:09:34,506 --> 00:09:38,272
I feel like I want to go at it
alone for a while.

154
00:09:38,343 --> 00:09:40,402
I mean, here I am,
completely single,

155
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:43,380
and I'm not so depressed
about it.

156
00:09:43,448 --> 00:09:46,383
And it's hard with Laura
being so grotesquely in love,

157
00:09:46,451 --> 00:09:49,511
but I'm still okay.

158
00:09:49,588 --> 00:09:53,524
And it's been forever
since I've been obsessed with anyone.

159
00:09:53,592 --> 00:09:56,425
So I think I'm doin'
a lot better in that area.

How are things with Andrew?

161
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:02,891
Great. I mean I...
I never thought that
we could be friends.

162
00:10:02,968 --> 00:10:05,664
And now I'm
totally over him.

Mmm.

00:10:09,841 --> 00:10:13,242
Well, why don't we pick
a time to stop, and then
work towards that?

165
00:10:13,311 --> 00:10:15,336
Okay.

166
00:10:15,413 --> 00:10:18,814
I was thinking a month.
One more month?

167
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:21,148
Okay.

168
00:10:21,219 --> 00:10:24,950
<i>- Hey, the video store guy</i>
<i>asked me out again.</i>
- He did?

169
00:10:25,023 --> 00:10:28,288
I said no.
He's really ugly.

170
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,591
Oh, Freddie de Salvo and
Andy Frumpkin were ugly,
and that didn't stop ya.

171
00:10:31,663 --> 00:10:35,622
- Hey. I was 13. I was ugly.
- Honey, you were never ugly.
You were hairy.

172
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,827
[Laughs]

173
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:39,996
<i>Oh, I think you should do it.</i>
<i>Maybe he's nice.</i>

174
00:10:40,071 --> 00:10:42,904
Maybe he isn't, but
at least if he's ugly
you'll have the upper hand.

175
00:10:42,974 --> 00:10:45,465
- I mean there's no risk.
- That's sick.

176
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:48,479
- You guys pity me.
<i>- [Together] Nah.</i>

177
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:53,348
<i>[Laughs]</i>
<i>Oh, my God, what's that?</i>
<i>It's so fake looking!</i>

178
00:10:53,418 --> 00:10:56,546
It looks like a Barbie ring,
Frank.

179
00:10:58,523 --> 00:11:02,118
It's... It's, uh...
It's not fake. Frank gave it to me.

180
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:06,187
- Oh, I know. I mean, it's one of
your jokes, right? From work.
- Uh-uh.

181
00:11:06,264 --> 00:11:08,994
- We're engaged.
- Yeah.

182
00:11:09,067 --> 00:11:11,467
We're gonna get married.

183
00:11:12,537 --> 00:11:16,371
Whoa. Ha!
You're engaged?

184
00:11:16,441 --> 00:11:19,205
Wow! That is...
That's unbelievable!

185
00:11:19,277 --> 00:11:22,041
That's great news.

186
00:11:22,113 --> 00:11:24,980
Oh, I'm sorry, Frank.
I thought that i-it was
one of your jokes from work.

187
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:27,018
No! No, it's,
uh, okay.

188
00:11:27,085 --> 00:11:30,077
Hey. We could have it
at the lake house.
I mean, I'll ask my mom.

189
00:11:30,155 --> 00:11:34,057
- But wouldn't that be great?
- That would be perfect.

190
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:37,686
I think this would be
a really bad time to stop.

191
00:11:37,762 --> 00:11:42,062
<i>Well, Amelia, I'm sorry</i>
<i>to say this, but I...</i>
<i>I think it's too late. I...</i>

192
00:11:43,134 --> 00:11:45,659
I've already filled your slot.

193
00:11:45,737 --> 00:11:49,764
- You filled my slot?
<i>- Yes.</i>

194
00:11:49,841 --> 00:11:51,775
And...

195
00:11:53,311 --> 00:11:57,270
I think you wanting to go it
alone was a positive step.

196
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:59,283
<i>Shall we stick to that?</i>

197
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,881
- Hi.
- Hi. How're you doin'?

198
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:10,120
I'm doin' all right.
How are you doin'?

199
00:12:10,195 --> 00:12:14,256
<i>- What are you up to?</i>
- Not much.

200
00:12:14,332 --> 00:12:18,666
<i>Well, I get off in a little</i>
<i>while. Can I talk you</i>
<i>into</i> Freak Show Seven?

201
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:20,705
There's a late show.

202
00:12:20,772 --> 00:12:23,536

203
00:12:23,608 --> 00:12:28,238
<i>[Movie:</i>
<i>Continuous Screaming]</i>

204
00:12:39,224 --> 00:12:42,785
You know, we could've
left the movie if it
was makin' you sick.

205
00:12:42,861 --> 00:12:45,523
<i>I couldn't stop watching it.</i>
<i>It was so gross.</i>

206
00:12:45,597 --> 00:12:48,464
Yeah, it was a good one.

207
00:12:48,533 --> 00:12:50,501
Look at this.

208
00:12:50,568 --> 00:12:54,595
I once... I once
put makeup like this
on my little brother.

209
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:57,039
Made it look like his
cheeks were falling off,

210
00:12:57,108 --> 00:12:59,338
and he was scared shitless.

211
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:02,869
He was just in the bathroom,
like, crying, looking into...
in the mirror,

212
00:13:02,947 --> 00:13:04,938
begging me
to take it off.

213
00:13:05,016 --> 00:13:08,315
- That was pretty funny.
- That's fucked up.
[Laughs]

214
00:13:08,386 --> 00:13:11,355
You think?
I was young.

215
00:13:13,024 --> 00:13:15,925
How's your stomach?

216
00:13:15,994 --> 00:13:19,930
- Not great.
- Mmm. Maybe this'll help.

217
00:13:26,304 --> 00:13:30,832
It probably would
if I could stop thinking
about that talking forehead.

218
00:13:30,909 --> 00:13:34,174
- Oh, man.
- I hear you.

219
00:13:37,315 --> 00:13:40,182
My best friend's
getting married.

220
00:13:40,251 --> 00:13:42,719
It's probably
what's making me sick.

221
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:46,714
Mmm.

224
00:13:53,665 --> 00:13:55,963
Good.

225
00:13:56,034 --> 00:13:58,298
Better.

226
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,304
Thanks.

227
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:05,139
Good. I actually
feel inspired to do some writing.

- Oh!
- I... If I feel it...
If I feel inspired,

229

- I should try to do some work.
- Okay.

230

- Yeah. Uh...

232

Yeah, it was.
I'll call you.

234
00:14:23,695 --> 00:14:27,927
Okay. All right.
Bye.

235
00:14:27,999 --> 00:14:29,933
Good night.

236
00:14:32,237 --> 00:14:35,604
Hi. It's me.

237
00:14:35,673 --> 00:14:37,607
Anyone? Anyone?

238
00:14:37,675 --> 00:14:40,701
Anyone? Are you guys
there?

239
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:43,339
What, are you screening?

240
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:47,078
<i>Pick up.</i>

241
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:52,488
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

242
00:14:52,557 --> 00:14:55,151
This sponge that I'm washing
dishes with is unbelievable.

243
00:14:55,226 --> 00:14:58,753
It... Oh, my God.
It smells like a hot dog.

244

<i>It's disgusting.</i>

245
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,834
And I can't stop smelling it.
[Sniffs]

246
00:15:05,904 --> 00:15:08,668
Are you gonna pick up?

247
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,935
Okay. All right, then.

248
00:15:11,009 --> 00:15:12,943
Okay. Bye-bye.

249
00:15:15,313 --> 00:15:18,578
- Don't you have work?
- Not today. I'm going to a meeting.

250
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:21,778
- Which? Overeaters?
- Alzheimer's.

251
00:15:21,853 --> 00:15:24,048
Oh. How is your dad?

252
00:15:25,757 --> 00:15:27,748
Not so good.

253
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:32,422
You know, you go to your
Coping With Alzheimer's meetings
more than you see your dad.

254
00:15:32,497 --> 00:15:36,331
I'm gonna see him
next week. Maybe you'd
like to come with me?

255
00:15:37,402 --> 00:15:39,233
- Queens?
- Yeah.

256
00:15:39,304 --> 00:15:43,172
I've been talking to that
woman in California...

257
00:15:43,241 --> 00:15:45,175
on the phone a lot lately.

258
00:15:45,243 --> 00:15:47,973
You know, the one
I told you about?

259
00:15:48,046 --> 00:15:51,277
Yeah. So?

260
00:15:51,349 --> 00:15:54,216
We, uh,
talk on the phone...

261
00:15:54,285 --> 00:15:58,847
for long... long...

262
00:15:58,923 --> 00:16:01,391
long... long...

263
00:16:01,459 --> 00:16:03,393
periods of time.

264
00:16:03,461 --> 00:16:05,486
- Oh, God. Ohh.
- And...

265
00:16:05,563 --> 00:16:08,225
Don't tell me this.
She talks and you jerk off.

266
00:16:08,299 --> 00:16:11,200
And the other way around.
You should hear the noise she makes.

267
00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:13,829
- I don't wanna hear this.
<i>- [Phone Ringing]</i>

Could you hold, please?

269
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:21,301
- We never did that.
- We didn't have to.

270
00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:25,315
- We lived in the same city.
- I thought you said you weren't
gonna get involved with anyone.

271
00:16:25,383 --> 00:16:28,875
I'm not involved.
We talk on the phone. That's it.

272
00:16:28,953 --> 00:16:31,513
I live in New York.
She lives in California.

273
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:34,080
- What's her name?
- Virginia.

274
00:16:34,158 --> 00:16:36,092
I'm probably never gonna
call her again anyway.

275
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,185
- So it's sort of a moot point.
- Oh, that's nice.

276
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:40,731
You've had phone sex
with this girl, and you're
never gonna call her again.

277
00:16:40,798 --> 00:16:43,323
You're an asshole.

278
00:16:43,401 --> 00:16:45,335
Don't call me
an asshole.

279
00:16:45,403 --> 00:16:49,237
- Well, does she know
how you feel?
- What?

280
00:16:49,307 --> 00:16:51,673
That that's it.

281
00:16:51,743 --> 00:16:55,076
Oh. I don't know.

282
00:16:57,215 --> 00:17:00,378
I've been thinking
about my son a lot lately.

283
00:17:00,451 --> 00:17:02,885
- I didn't know you had a son.
<i>- Yes, you did.</i>

284
00:17:02,954 --> 00:17:05,923
Remember you suggested
I send him a card
a couple of months ago?

285
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:08,652
- Oh. Right. God.
<i>- Well, so...</i>

286
00:17:08,726 --> 00:17:12,492
I called him,
and I headed out there.

287
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:16,056
But as soon as I sat down
on the bus, I knew it
would be a mistake.

288
00:17:16,134 --> 00:17:20,730
<i>You know how I knew?</i>
<i>Because right there, on that</i>
<i>shiny pole that you hang onto,</i>

289
00:17:20,805 --> 00:17:25,265
was a little red devil,
smiling right at me
and laughin' at me.

290
00:17:25,343 --> 00:17:29,541
The devil. And... And
that would be the same
devil you mentioned before?

291
00:17:29,614 --> 00:17:32,742
Then I looked out,
and he was on the tip of my shoe.

292
00:17:34,652 --> 00:17:37,382
She was coming on to me
so strong.

293
00:17:37,455 --> 00:17:40,481
And I didn't really
feel anything.

294
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:44,255
But then she...
She started to touch me.

295
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:48,561
<i>I felt aroused. Still, I-I didn't</i>
<i>want it to go any further.</i>

296
00:17:48,633 --> 00:17:51,727
I mean, she thought I did, because...
Well, I mean, she could see.

297
00:17:51,803 --> 00:17:54,169
<i>It was so fucked up.</i>

298
00:17:54,238 --> 00:17:57,537
<i>I never should have called her,</i>
<i>but I feel weird not wanting</i>
<i>to go out with some girl.</i>

299
00:17:57,609 --> 00:18:01,010
<i>You know, I feel like</i>
<i>there's something wrong with me</i>
<i>if I don't want any sex.</i>

300
00:18:02,313 --> 00:18:04,247
<i>You know what I'm saying?</i>

301
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:07,784
Y-You know what I'm sayin'?

302
00:18:07,852 --> 00:18:12,846
I'm a bad therapist.
Do you hear me? I am a bad therapist.

303
00:18:12,924 --> 00:18:15,654
- Who am I gonna bring
to your wedding?
- I am making these people worse.

304
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:18,890
<i>- [Dog Barking]</i>

gonna wonder...

305

your brother thinks I'm a lesbian.

306
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,768
<i>You slept with my brother.</i>
<i>How could he think you're a lesbian?</i>

307
00:18:24,836 --> 00:18:27,896
Come on. Do you really care
what my brother thinks? Do you?

308
00:18:27,972 --> 00:18:29,906
Hmm. No.

309
00:18:29,974 --> 00:18:31,908
I have a crush
on one of my patients.

310
00:18:32,977 --> 00:18:34,911
What?
What do you mean?

311
00:18:34,979 --> 00:18:38,142
I mean...
This is not funny.

312
00:18:38,216 --> 00:18:41,652
- I mean a crush, like I
want to fuck one of them.
- [Inhales]

313
00:18:41,719 --> 00:18:45,678
Oh, my God.
You mean my shrink
could want to fuck me?

314
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:48,521
- Hello, this isn't about
you. This is about me.
- You're right.

00:19:24,529 --> 00:19:27,191
Maybe the best thing
would be to put her down.

325
00:19:27,265 --> 00:19:31,292
- Okay.
- No, I mean down. I mean...

326
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:34,930
I-I mean
put her to sleep.

327
00:19:39,544 --> 00:19:41,569
I...
I can't do that.

328
00:19:41,646 --> 00:19:43,841
I mean, maybe the treatments
will work.

329
00:19:43,915 --> 00:19:46,406
It's gonna be
expensive, Amelia.

330
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:51,448
- You're cold.
- I am... All right,
I'll split it with you.

331
00:19:51,522 --> 00:19:53,490
Okay?

332
00:19:58,396 --> 00:20:01,160
- That looks familiar.
<i>- Well, she's lending it to me.</i>

333
00:20:01,232 --> 00:20:03,393
- She's got a date.
- A date?

334
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:06,301
It's not a date.

335
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:08,304
- It's the ugly guy.
- [Laura Laughs]

336
00:20:08,372 --> 00:20:12,468
<i>Well, if it's the ugly guy,</i>
<i>then why are you wearin'the sexy top?</i>

337
00:20:12,543 --> 00:20:14,477
- That is such a good point.
<i>- Fuck you both.</i>

338
00:20:14,545 --> 00:20:19,209
Okay, I have no clothes,
and he's taking me to some
weirdo convention.

339
00:20:19,283 --> 00:20:21,649
- Lookit, honey. See the pigs?
- Mm-hmm.

340
00:20:21,719 --> 00:20:24,187
- I designed them for you.
- I'm touched. Listen, Frank.

341
00:20:24,255 --> 00:20:26,416
Did you call the guys
that you said you were gonna invite?

342
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:29,460
- No.
- Why not?

343
00:20:29,527 --> 00:20:32,394
- What do you mean, why not?
- I mean, why not?
Why didn't you do it?

344
00:20:32,463 --> 00:20:35,227
'Cause I didn't.
I'll do it. Shut up about it.

345
00:20:35,299 --> 00:20:38,393
- I'm not gonna shut up
about it. Look at all...
- You guys fight? Cool.

346
00:20:38,469 --> 00:20:40,699

- You're being a very good sport.
- Thanks.

351
00:20:57,188 --> 00:21:00,749
So what's your, um,
screenplay about?

352
00:21:00,825 --> 00:21:04,317
It's based on the life
of Colette.

353
00:21:04,395 --> 00:21:06,863
Wow. Are you kidding?

354
00:21:06,931 --> 00:21:08,865
No. Why?

355
00:21:10,067 --> 00:21:12,627
Nothing. I just...
You know.

356
00:21:12,703 --> 00:21:17,697
I thought you'd be writing
about people stabbing each other
or something. Right?

357
00:21:17,775 --> 00:21:19,902
These people
make great stuff.

358
00:21:19,977 --> 00:21:22,946
This is... I mean,
you got to, you know,
sort of have a...

00:21:23,014 --> 00:21:24,948
a certain frame of mind
to appreciate it,

360
00:21:25,016 --> 00:21:28,952
but I think that, you know,
doctors who operate
on the human body,

361
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,954
they think it's beautiful,
and it's...

362
00:21:31,022 --> 00:21:34,185
It's the same with, you know,
people who make this stuff.

363
00:21:34,258 --> 00:21:36,556
It's... I... I think
there's something...

364
00:21:36,627 --> 00:21:40,859
<i>really poetic</i>
<i>about it all, : It's art.</i>

365
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:43,765

erotic about it.

00:21:45,336 --> 00:21:47,463

- She's cute.

Uh, do cats get cancer?

three cats, and I was

How long were you
with your old girlfriend?

383
00:22:56,941 --> 00:22:58,875
Three years.

384
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:05,247
Lived together
for two of them.

You ever live
with anyone?

386
00:23:11,455 --> 00:23:16,154
No. I... Which, I...
I guess is a good thing,

387
00:23:16,227 --> 00:23:19,162
'cause then I never
had to move out from anyone.

Well, I'm actually studying

- Well, my actor-model friends
all go see therapists, so...

00:28:28,872 --> 00:28:33,332
Yeah, and... and my toenails.
But I guess that would be
considered less charming.

00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:36,709
- Yeah.
- Okay, I have to go.

467
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:39,613

- Oh, yeah.

476
00:29:11,382 --> 00:29:14,078
Like, just tell me

00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,460
- I'm gonna do your hair.
- No, I want someone
sort of special to do it.

644
00:39:00,537 --> 00:39:03,904
I mean... I'm sorry.
I want somebody, you know,
to do something with this hair.

645
00:39:03,974 --> 00:39:06,738
You know
how much I hate it.

646
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:08,744
So listen, are we
still planning to go to
Pennsylvania this weekend?

647
00:39:08,812 --> 00:39:10,803
I think you guys should
come up, you know,

648
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:14,044
at least once before
the wedding, just to plan stuff.

649
00:39:14,117 --> 00:39:18,747
- Yeah. Definitely.
- Okay. I'll talk to you later, then.

650
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:30,194
- Hi, Bill.
- Hi. How you doin'?

651
00:39:31,835 --> 00:39:33,769
Um, fine.

652
00:39:33,837 --> 00:39:35,771
<i>Um, I was wondering...</i>
<i>do you have...</i>

653
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:38,740
uh, <i>Jaws</i> in stock?

654
00:39:38,808 --> 00:39:40,742
Yeah, I think so.

655
00:39:42,779 --> 00:39:47,045
<i>Haven't seen you around.</i>
<i>Where you been? You</i>
<i>haven't rented lately.</i>

656
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,416
I've been... busy.

657
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:56,550
Yeah, we have <i>Jaws</i>
in stock. I'll go get it.

658
00:40:08,471 --> 00:40:11,702
Here you go.
Uh, phone number?

659
00:40:13,343 --> 00:40:17,677
<i>555-6972.</i>

660
00:40:21,618 --> 00:40:24,519
Mmm.
Thanks.

661
00:40:27,857 --> 00:40:30,485
See ya.

662
00:40:31,561 --> 00:40:33,495
"Rented lately"?

663
00:40:33,563 --> 00:40:38,330
Are you crazy? I had sex
with you two weeks ago,

664
00:40:38,401 --> 00:40:41,234
and now you're asking me
why I haven't rented lately?

665
00:40:41,304 --> 00:40:44,671
I don't know. I... I...
I didn't know what to say.

666
00:40:44,741 --> 00:40:47,642
How about... How about,
"Why haven't you called me?"
How about that?

667
00:40:48,845 --> 00:40:53,009
I was busy, okay?

668
00:40:54,651 --> 00:40:57,142
Fine.

669
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:02,317
- Amelia, wait.
- Forget it.

670
00:41:02,392 --> 00:41:05,850
<i>No, wait. We'll finish this.</i>
<i>All right? 'Cause it's</i>
<i>not what you think.</i>

671
00:41:05,929 --> 00:41:10,764
Oh, no, it's never what I think.
I mean, that's what gets me
into these messes. Okay, what?

672
00:41:10,834 --> 00:41:14,861
What is it? What is it?
I'm listening. What's the reason?

673
00:41:14,938 --> 00:41:19,432
I know you... I know
you think I'm ugly.

674
00:41:19,509 --> 00:41:24,503
- What?
- I know you referred to me
as "the ugly guy."

675
00:41:24,581 --> 00:41:26,811
And I don't...
I don't need friends
who talk about me that way.

676
00:41:26,883 --> 00:41:29,545
Okay? That's
why I didn't call you.

677
00:41:29,619 --> 00:41:32,452
- I never... I don't know
why you think that.
- You got a message...

678
00:41:32,522 --> 00:41:34,456
on your machine
when you were in the bathroom.

679
00:41:34,524 --> 00:41:37,118
Some girl
was talkin' about me.

680
00:41:37,193 --> 00:41:39,753
That's how I know.

681
00:41:39,829 --> 00:41:43,856
- What message?
- I don't know. I erased it.

682
00:41:44,934 --> 00:41:48,062
Can I go now?

683
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,974
Do you forgive me?

684
00:42:02,652 --> 00:42:05,644
<i>Laura. Are you there?</i>
<i>It's me. Pick up.</i>

685
00:42:05,722 --> 00:42:09,055
Look, I really need to talk
to you. Did you leave
a message on my machine...

686
00:42:09,125 --> 00:42:11,753
about Bill being ugly?

687
00:42:11,828 --> 00:42:14,797
Laura! Shit.

688
00:42:19,002 --> 00:42:20,936
<i>[Door Closes]</i>

689
00:42:21,204 --> 00:42:24,503
<i>[Peter]</i>
<i>God, she could've given me</i>
<i>a hug or something.</i>

690
00:42:24,574 --> 00:42:27,771
- What're you talking about?
She's not your girl.
- So?

691
00:42:27,844 --> 00:42:31,871
- She hurt me very, very bad.
- Badly.

692
00:42:31,948 --> 00:42:33,882
Whatever, man!

693
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:38,319
<i>You're so insensitive.</i>
<i>I'm sick of all your crap.</i>

694
00:42:38,388 --> 00:42:41,789
<i>You're no friend to me.</i>
<i>You're an enemy.</i>

695
00:42:41,858 --> 00:42:44,759
Leave!
Begone!

696
00:42:44,828 --> 00:42:47,888
This guy directing the play
is such an idiot.

697
00:42:47,964 --> 00:42:50,660
He's a total putz.

698
00:42:50,733 --> 00:42:53,827
He's really just a spoiled actor
who thinks he can direct.

699
00:42:53,903 --> 00:42:56,997
And someone gave him the money.
I swear I don't know who.

700
00:42:57,073 --> 00:43:00,600
And voila! He's
directing a play.

701
00:43:00,677 --> 00:43:03,510
I said I'd do it,
just 'cause I need to work.

702
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:05,514
- Right?
- Right.

703
00:43:05,582 --> 00:43:08,881
But what I really
want to do is write
and direct my own stuff.

704
00:43:08,952 --> 00:43:10,886
- I'm sorry. I'm boring you.
- No. No!

705
00:43:10,954 --> 00:43:13,855
I thought the play was good.
This is interesting to me.

706
00:43:13,923 --> 00:43:18,019
I don't... I don't normally
hear this kind of stuff.

707
00:43:19,162 --> 00:43:22,097
- Where are you from?
- New York.

708
00:43:22,165 --> 00:43:24,258
What do you do
in your spare time?

709
00:43:24,334 --> 00:43:26,802
I... Stuff.

710
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:30,033
- You got brothers or sisters?
- Why are you interviewing me?

711
00:43:30,106 --> 00:43:32,267
'Cause I haven't shut up,
and I feel bad.

712
00:43:32,342 --> 00:43:35,140
Oh, no. Don't. Oh.

713
00:43:35,211 --> 00:43:38,112
- You put clear nail polish
on. That looks pretty.
- They... Th-Thank you.

714
00:43:38,181 --> 00:43:40,115
- Peter. Unbelievable!
- Hey!

715
00:43:40,183 --> 00:43:42,913
- You were so great!
- Peter, I gotta go. Bye.

716
00:43:42,986 --> 00:43:46,513
- Stay! You sure you can't stay?
- Thanks. No. Yeah.

717
00:43:51,661 --> 00:43:53,595
- Hi, Frank.
- Hi.

718
00:43:53,663 --> 00:43:57,258
Is she here? I... I know
you guys screen your calls,
but I... I thought I would try...

719
00:43:57,333 --> 00:44:02,771
She's not here. I thought
she was with you, and then...
I... I heard your message.

720
00:44:05,308 --> 00:44:08,334
- Okay. Well, will you
tell her I came by?
- Yeah, I...

721
00:44:08,411 --> 00:44:10,641
Are you okay?

722
00:44:10,713 --> 00:44:13,546
You... Do you want to come in
and... and talk or something?

723
00:44:15,785 --> 00:44:18,219
- I don't want to bug you.
- You're not buggin' me.

724
00:44:18,288 --> 00:44:21,780
I... I'm just tryin'
to fold my laundry. Come on in.

725
00:44:24,527 --> 00:44:27,121
Wow. What are these?

726
00:44:27,197 --> 00:44:29,324
Ah, just some stuff
I've been workin' on.

727
00:44:30,967 --> 00:44:32,901
They're beautiful.

728
00:44:34,938 --> 00:44:38,806
- Are you stoned?
- Yeah. You want some?

729
00:44:39,876 --> 00:44:41,810
Yeah.

730
00:44:44,447 --> 00:44:46,381
Yeah.

731
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:51,453
It's pretty strong.

732
00:44:53,389 --> 00:44:55,323
[Laughs]

733
00:44:56,859 --> 00:44:59,350
I know you think
I'm some kind of hack or something.

734
00:44:59,429 --> 00:45:02,364
No, I don't. I just...
I've never... I've never
seen your stuff before.

735
00:45:02,432 --> 00:45:05,230
I mean that... that you liked.
You know?

736
00:45:05,301 --> 00:45:09,169
Yeah, well, I've been
trying to work on it more lately.

737
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:13,073
But, uh, I don't know
what to do. I...

738
00:45:13,142 --> 00:45:15,906
I just started
getting back into it.

739
00:45:15,979 --> 00:45:19,915
And they offered me
this new line at work,

740
00:45:19,983 --> 00:45:23,817
designing a series of...

741
00:45:23,886 --> 00:45:26,616
men's leisure rings.
[Laughs]

742
00:45:26,689 --> 00:45:28,623
Yuck.

743
00:45:30,393 --> 00:45:33,328
- What are those?
- Exactly.

744
00:45:35,832 --> 00:45:37,766
Oh, man.

745
00:45:40,937 --> 00:45:44,771
Now, that is just the...

746
00:45:45,842 --> 00:45:48,140
teeniest, tiniest,

747
00:45:48,211 --> 00:45:51,476
most adorable thing
I have ever seen.

748
00:45:55,685 --> 00:45:57,949
She wears an eight.

749
00:45:58,021 --> 00:45:59,955
[Giggles]

750
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:06,694
- What are you doing?
- What?

751
00:46:06,763 --> 00:46:10,324
- You smelled your armpit.
- It comforts me.

752
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,698
- What?
- Try it. Hi.

753
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:14,794
- Stop! Hi, Ma.
- Andrew.

754
00:46:14,871 --> 00:46:17,465
- Darling, am I late?
- Ma, this is Amelia.

755
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:19,940
- Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.
- Yes, hello, Amelia.

756
00:46:20,009 --> 00:46:22,307
How do I look, Andrew?
I... I tried to pull myself together.

757
00:46:22,378 --> 00:46:24,642
- You look good.
- I have an interview across town.

758
00:46:24,714 --> 00:46:27,080
<i>- What interview?</i>
<i>- I'm gonna take a job.</i>

759
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:29,482
<i>Part-time, maybe,</i>
<i>if I can get day care.</i>

760
00:46:29,552 --> 00:46:32,112
- Hey, Danny.
- Hi, Andrew!

761
00:46:32,188 --> 00:46:34,782
- Look who's here.
- Hey, pretty girl!

762
00:46:34,857 --> 00:46:39,055
- Have you missed your uncle?
<i>- Danny, this is Amelia.</i>
<i>You don't know her.</i>

763
00:46:39,128 --> 00:46:41,062
- I don't know her?
- No.

764
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:43,792
- You're gonna tell me
I don't know this girl?
- You know me.

765
00:46:43,866 --> 00:46:47,233
And, Danny, Andrew's
gonna take you for that
haircut we talked about.

766
00:46:47,303 --> 00:46:49,794
- Okay. I'm ready.
- All right.

767
00:46:50,907 --> 00:46:52,841
You know what I
just thought of?

768
00:46:52,909 --> 00:46:56,436
It'll be a great idea
for the birthday party.

769
00:46:56,512 --> 00:46:59,948
We should have cold cuts.
Corned beef.

770
00:47:00,016 --> 00:47:03,076
It's been forever
since I've had juicy corned beef.

771
00:47:03,152 --> 00:47:05,347
That sounds delicious.

772
00:47:05,421 --> 00:47:07,753
That's a good idea.

773
00:47:07,824 --> 00:47:12,318
<i>You know, when Andrew was</i>
<i>a little boy, he used to hate to</i>
<i>get his hair cut. Didn't you?</i>

774
00:47:14,997 --> 00:47:18,023
<i>But do you remember</i>
<i>what we did after your haircut?</i>

775
00:47:18,101 --> 00:47:22,162
I'd take you to the dump.
It was your favorite place to go.

776
00:47:22,238 --> 00:47:25,969
We'd climb on top
of this huge mountain of stuff.

777
00:47:26,042 --> 00:47:30,103
There were seagulls
flying all around. It stank!

778
00:47:30,179 --> 00:47:32,909
<i>But once we found a bicycle</i>
<i>there. Remember that?</i>

779
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:38,216
- You know what I just thought of?
<i>- [Amelia] What?</i>

780
00:47:38,287 --> 00:47:42,553
I think cold cuts
at the party would be great.

781
00:47:42,625 --> 00:47:46,618
<i>It's been ages since I've</i>
<i>had a juicy corned beef.</i>

782
00:47:46,696 --> 00:47:49,494
Sounds delicious.
It's a good idea.

783
00:47:52,769 --> 00:47:55,761
- [Machine Beeps]
- I don't know what I'm doing
in this line.

784
00:47:55,838 --> 00:47:58,363
I have like $32
in my account.

785
00:47:58,441 --> 00:48:01,239
I thought you were gonna move
paintings for that rich guy.

786
00:48:01,310 --> 00:48:03,278
I am.
That's next week.

787
00:48:03,346 --> 00:48:06,338
What do you think? Could I
borrow a couple of bucks just
to get me through some bills?

788
00:48:06,416 --> 00:48:10,978
- Sure. How much?
- Mmm. Couple hundred.

789
00:48:11,053 --> 00:48:15,649
You know, your dad is
not as bad as I pictured.

790
00:48:15,725 --> 00:48:18,626
No, he's great.
It's my mom who's pathetic.

791
00:48:18,694 --> 00:48:20,685
Why? She
seemed nice.

792
00:48:20,763 --> 00:48:25,200
You met her for five minutes
and you think you know her
better than I do?

793
00:48:25,268 --> 00:48:27,566
Fuck you.

794
00:48:27,637 --> 00:48:30,800
- Fuck you.
- You were rude.

795
00:48:30,873 --> 00:48:33,034
It's none of your business.

796
00:48:33,109 --> 00:48:36,044
You asked me
to come with you.

797
00:48:39,982 --> 00:48:42,109
Thanks.

798
00:48:42,185 --> 00:48:44,881
- I can pay you next week.
- Good. I'll need it.

799
00:48:45,988 --> 00:48:48,183
Where you goin'?

800
00:48:48,257 --> 00:48:50,384
I'm goin' home.
Where you goin'?

801
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:53,258
I was, uh... I was gonna go
to the phone company, pay my bill.

802
00:48:53,329 --> 00:48:55,957
Okay. So I'll

861

he saw this pair of pants...

<i>that he somehow thought would</i>

So what happened?

864
00:52:13,663 --> 00:52:18,464
So he was hinting and hinting,
and so I finally went out
and bought him these pants.

865
00:52:18,534 --> 00:52:22,026
- And I... I hid them in a box
under my bed.
- [Laughs]

I was really nervous.

867
00:52:24,507 --> 00:52:27,670
'Cause, you know,
I didn't know... I didn't know
if he was gonna get me anything.

868
00:52:27,743 --> 00:52:29,734
I didn't know if our...
our relationship...

- Mmm.

you know.

871
00:52:35,584 --> 00:52:39,281
It's nice to be giving.
It's nice to give him something.
So I will.

872
00:52:39,355 --> 00:52:44,292
But, um, we never made it
to Christmas, 'cause a week
after I bought him these pants,

873
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:49,195
he started acting all panicky
and distant.

874
00:52:49,265 --> 00:52:52,723
And then he said that he thought
we should cool it.

875
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:09,543
What?
What's the matter?

876
00:53:12,488 --> 00:53:15,252
Mmm?

877
00:53:15,324 --> 00:53:17,952

gotten that checked?
Did you see a doctor?

878

No. I forgot.

<i>- Yeah. I want it back.</i>

- Yes, give me back my mole!

1117

1120
01:09:17,719 --> 01:09:20,517
Bill, I feel really bad
about what happened.

1121
01:09:20,588 --> 01:09:23,819
I liked you. I wanted
to see you again.

1122
01:09:23,892 --> 01:09:26,156
Well, you know.
It worked out for the best.

1123
01:09:26,227 --> 01:09:29,094
I got back together
with my old girlfriend.

Oh.

- Yeah. We're gonna go watch
dwarf bowling tonight.

1126
01:09:37,172 --> 01:09:39,663
Her father
got us tickets.

1127

- Dwarfs bowling?
- No. It's like, uh...

1128
01:09:42,711 --> 01:09:44,645
No. People bowl
with dwarfs.

1129
01:09:44,713 --> 01:09:49,650
Like, they pick 'em up and
use 'em as bowling balls. It's great.

1130
01:09:49,718 --> 01:09:53,245
- That's sick.
- No, no, no. The dwarfs like it.

1131
01:09:53,321 --> 01:09:56,290
I've seen it before.
My girlfriend's really into it.

1132

- What?

You wouldn't believe
the humiliation I had to
withstand to rent them.

So tell me what happened
with Virginia.

1141
01:10:31,059 --> 01:10:34,961
It was awful. I didn't
even remember what she
really looked like.

Nothing.
Nobody, I guess.

1147

I told her the truth,
though. I told her that
an in-person relationship...

<i>handle right now.</i>

1149

Okay.
You're right.

You're right. I don't call you
