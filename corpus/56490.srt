1
00:00:31,773 --> 00:00:34,571
Two households, both alike in dignity...

2
00:00:34,653 --> 00:00:37,725
...in fair Verona, where we lay our scene...

3
00:00:37,813 --> 00:00:40,885
...from ancient grudge
break to new mutiny...

4
00:00:40,973 --> 00:00:44,090
...where civil blood
makes civil hands unclean.

5
00:00:44,173 --> 00:00:46,926
From forth the fatal loins
of these two foes...

6
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:50,005
...a pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;

7
00:00:50,093 --> 00:00:52,653
...whose misadventured piteous overthrows...

8
00:00:52,733 --> 00:00:55,930
...doth with their death
bury their parents' strife.

9
00:00:56,013 --> 00:00:58,766
The fearful passage
of their death-mark'd love...

10
00:00:58,853 --> 00:01:01,526
...and the continuance
of their parents' rage...

11
00:01:01,613 --> 00:01:05,367
...which, but their children's end,
nought could remove...

12
00:01:05,453 --> 00:01:08,092
...is now the two hours' traffic of our stage.

13
00:01:26,933 --> 00:01:29,572
Two households...

14
00:01:29,653 --> 00:01:31,723
...both alike in dignity...

15
00:01:31,813 --> 00:01:35,283
...in fair Verona, where we lay our scene...

16
00:01:35,373 --> 00:01:40,367
...from ancient grudge
break to new mutiny...

17
00:01:40,453 --> 00:01:44,765
...where civil blood
makes civil hands unclean.

18
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:52,052
From forth the fatal loins
of these two foes...

19
00:01:53,093 --> 00:01:58,008
...a pair of star-cross'd lovers
take their life.

20
00:02:33,893 --> 00:02:38,683
A dog of the house of Capulet
moves me!

21
00:02:38,773 --> 00:02:40,764
(rap music on car radio)

22
00:02:44,973 --> 00:02:46,964
Pedlar's excrement!

23
00:02:47,053 --> 00:02:50,329
King Urinal! Go rot!

24
00:02:50,933 --> 00:02:52,889
(radio) # The boys! The boys!

25
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:10,207
- The quarrel is between our masters.
- And us their men!

26
00:03:11,013 --> 00:03:11,968
(laughs) Ahh!

27
00:03:29,253 --> 00:03:31,244
(girls giggling)

28
00:03:33,093 --> 00:03:37,211
Hubble, bubble, toil and trouble!

29
00:03:37,293 --> 00:03:41,252
(both chanting)
And I am a pretty piece of flesh!

30
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:42,812
I am...

31
00:03:44,293 --> 00:03:47,444
...a pretty piece of flesh!

32
00:03:47,533 --> 00:03:48,329
(gasps)

33
00:03:51,853 --> 00:03:55,562
- Here comes of the house of Capulet!
- Quarrel, I will back thee.

34
00:04:02,453 --> 00:04:03,044
Huh?

35
00:04:05,373 --> 00:04:07,329
- Boo!
- (laughing)

36
00:04:10,573 --> 00:04:12,245
(laughing)

37
00:04:15,613 --> 00:04:19,083
I will bite my thumb at them, which is
a disgrace to them, if they bear it.

38
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,451
Go forth! I will back thee!

39
00:04:39,573 --> 00:04:42,371
- Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
- I... I do bite my thumb, sir.

40
00:04:42,453 --> 00:04:44,523
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

41
00:04:44,613 --> 00:04:47,047
- Is the law of our side if I say ay?
- No!

42
00:04:47,133 --> 00:04:50,205
No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir,
but I bite my thumb, sir!

43
00:04:50,293 --> 00:04:53,205
- Do you quarrel, sir?
- Quarrel, sir? No, sir!

44
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,205
But if you do, sir, I am for you.
I serve as good a man as you.

45
00:04:56,293 --> 00:04:58,204
- No better?
- Uh... uh...

46
00:04:58,293 --> 00:05:00,329
Here comes our kinsman. Say better!

47
00:05:00,413 --> 00:05:02,165
- Yes, sir, better!
- You lie!

48
00:05:02,733 --> 00:05:04,325
Draw, if you be men!

49
00:05:04,413 --> 00:05:06,290
(women scream)

50
00:05:07,813 --> 00:05:09,610
Part, fools! You know not what you do.

51
00:05:16,773 --> 00:05:18,286
Put up your Swords!

52
00:05:48,013 --> 00:05:51,210
What, art thou drawn
among these... heartless hinds?

53
00:05:53,173 --> 00:05:55,004
Turn thee, Benvolio...

54
00:05:56,213 --> 00:05:58,852
...and look upon thy death.

55
00:05:59,853 --> 00:06:01,844
I do but keep the peace.

56
00:06:01,933 --> 00:06:03,889
Put up thy Sword...

57
00:06:03,973 --> 00:06:06,487
...or manage it to part these men with me.

58
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:08,724
Peace?

59
00:06:09,173 --> 00:06:11,004
Peace?

60
00:06:11,093 --> 00:06:13,084
I hate the word...

61
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:16,045
...as I hate hell...

62
00:06:16,133 --> 00:06:17,851
...all Montagues...

63
00:06:21,693 --> 00:06:22,728
...and thee.

64
00:06:22,813 --> 00:06:24,212
(boy) Bang bang!

65
00:06:25,973 --> 00:06:26,644
Bang.

66
00:06:38,693 --> 00:06:40,126
(yelling)

67
00:06:57,693 --> 00:06:59,649
- Come forth! Come!
- Wait!

68
00:07:04,573 --> 00:07:06,643
Come forth!

69
00:07:10,613 --> 00:07:11,489
(gunshots)

70
00:07:20,653 --> 00:07:22,132
Agh!

71
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,130
(car horns)

72
00:08:00,933 --> 00:08:03,288
(helicopter)

73
00:08:10,813 --> 00:08:13,202
(TV) From ancient grudge
break to new mutiny...

74
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:19,163
Do not proceed!

75
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:28,164
Give me my Longsword, ho!

76
00:08:28,253 --> 00:08:30,847
Thou shalt not stir one foot
to seek a foe.

77
00:08:38,733 --> 00:08:40,530
(Prince) Rebellious subjects...

78
00:08:40,613 --> 00:08:42,331
...enemies to peace!

79
00:08:42,413 --> 00:08:44,483
Throw your mistemper'd weapons
to the ground!

80
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:47,845
On pain of torture...

81
00:08:47,933 --> 00:08:52,723
...from those bloody hands throw your
mistemper'd weapons to the ground!

82
00:08:54,173 --> 00:08:56,641
Three civil brawls...

83
00:08:56,733 --> 00:09:00,328
...bred of an airy word by thee,
old Capulet, and Montague...

84
00:09:00,413 --> 00:09:03,325
...have thrice disturbed
the quiet of our streets.

85
00:09:04,493 --> 00:09:07,690
If ever you disturb our streets again...

86
00:09:08,373 --> 00:09:11,763
...your lives shall pay
the forfeit of the peace.

87
00:09:25,533 --> 00:09:27,967
O where is Romeo? Saw you him today?

88
00:09:29,013 --> 00:09:31,652
Right glad I am he was not at this fray.

89
00:09:32,453 --> 00:09:35,172
Madam, underneath the Grove
of Sycamore...

90
00:09:35,253 --> 00:09:37,972
...so early walking did I see your son.

91
00:09:38,053 --> 00:09:40,248
Many a morning
hath he there been seen...

92
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:43,245
...with tears augmenting
the fresh morning's dew.

93
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:46,609
Away from light
steals home my heavy son...

94
00:09:46,693 --> 00:09:50,003
...and private in his chamber
pens himself...

95
00:09:50,093 --> 00:09:52,084
...shuts up his windows...

96
00:09:52,173 --> 00:09:56,963
...locks fair daylight out, and
makes himself an artificial night.

97
00:10:07,533 --> 00:10:09,046
Why, then...

98
00:10:09,133 --> 00:10:13,206
...O brawling love, O loving hate!

99
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:17,369
O anything of nothing first create!

100
00:10:17,453 --> 00:10:19,284
Heavy lightness...

101
00:10:19,373 --> 00:10:21,364
...serious vanity.

102
00:10:22,293 --> 00:10:25,365
Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms.

103
00:11:12,413 --> 00:11:15,803
Black and portentous
must this humour prove...

104
00:11:17,813 --> 00:11:20,725
...unless good counsel
may the cause remove.

105
00:11:22,573 --> 00:11:24,564
So please you, step aside.

106
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:30,125
I'll know his grievance
or be much denied.

107
00:11:30,813 --> 00:11:32,804
Come, madam, let's away.

108
00:11:46,493 --> 00:11:48,484
Good morrow, cousin.

109
00:11:49,373 --> 00:11:51,364
Is the day so young?

110
00:11:51,453 --> 00:11:53,523
But new struck, coz.

111
00:11:54,253 --> 00:11:56,244
Ay me, sad hours seem long.

112
00:11:59,493 --> 00:12:01,927
Was that my father that went hence so fast?

113
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:04,049
It was.

114
00:12:04,133 --> 00:12:05,805
What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?

115
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:07,963
Not having that
which having makes them short.

116
00:12:08,053 --> 00:12:09,281
- In love?
- Out.

117
00:12:09,373 --> 00:12:11,648
- Of love?
- Out of her favour where I am in love.

118
00:12:11,733 --> 00:12:13,769
Alas that love,
so gentle in his view...

119
00:12:13,853 --> 00:12:16,083
...should be so tyrannous
and rough in proof.

120
00:12:16,173 --> 00:12:18,641
Alas that love,
whose view is muffled still...

121
00:12:18,733 --> 00:12:21,372
...should without eyes
see pathways to his will.

122
00:12:21,453 --> 00:12:23,364
Where shall we dine?

123
00:12:23,453 --> 00:12:24,363
(TV)... this costly blood.

124
00:12:24,453 --> 00:12:27,604
Never anger made good guard for itself.

125
00:12:27,693 --> 00:12:28,808
The law hath not been dead...

126
00:12:28,893 --> 00:12:30,804
O me! What fray was here?

127
00:12:30,893 --> 00:12:33,202
- Coz, I...
- Yet tell me not, for I've heard it all.

128
00:12:33,293 --> 00:12:35,853
Here's much to do with hate,
but more with love.

129
00:12:35,933 --> 00:12:38,163
Why, then, O brawling love,
O loving hate!

130
00:12:38,253 --> 00:12:40,164
O anything of nothing first create!

131
00:12:40,253 --> 00:12:42,767
O heavy lightness, serious vanity!

132
00:12:42,853 --> 00:12:45,447
Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!

133
00:12:45,533 --> 00:12:47,569
- Feather of lead, br...
- (chuckles)

134
00:12:48,813 --> 00:12:50,804
Dost thou not laugh?

135
00:12:51,173 --> 00:12:53,129
No, coz, I rather weep.

136
00:12:53,213 --> 00:12:55,204
Good heart, at what?

137
00:12:55,493 --> 00:12:58,724
- At thy good heart's oppression.
- Farewell, my coz.

138
00:12:58,813 --> 00:13:02,601
Soft, I will go along. And if you
leave me so, you do me wrong.

139
00:13:09,973 --> 00:13:13,363
But Montague is bound as well as l,
in penalty alike.

140
00:13:13,453 --> 00:13:16,923
And 'tis not hard, I think, for men
as old as we to keep the peace.

141
00:13:17,013 --> 00:13:20,369
Of honourable reckoning are you both,
and pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.

142
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,683
But now, my lord,
what say you to my suit?

143
00:13:22,773 --> 00:13:27,722
But saying o'er what I have said before:
my child is yet a stranger in the world.

144
00:13:27,813 --> 00:13:31,806
Let two more summers wither in their pride
ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.

145
00:13:31,893 --> 00:13:33,690
Younger than she are happy mothers made.

146
00:13:33,773 --> 00:13:37,004
And too soon marr'd are those so early made.

147
00:13:37,173 --> 00:13:39,448
This night I hold an old accustom'd feast.

148
00:13:39,533 --> 00:13:41,967
At my poor house look to behold this night...

149
00:13:42,053 --> 00:13:45,523
...fresh female buds
that make dark heaven light.

150
00:13:46,093 --> 00:13:48,084
Hear all, all see...

151
00:13:48,173 --> 00:13:51,085
...and like her most
whose merit most shall be.

152
00:13:51,173 --> 00:13:52,686
Come, go with me.

153
00:13:53,813 --> 00:13:56,043
Tell me in sadness,
who is it that you love?

154
00:13:56,133 --> 00:13:58,203
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.

155
00:13:58,293 --> 00:14:01,171
I aim'd so near when I supposed you loved.

156
00:14:01,733 --> 00:14:04,247
A right good marksman!
And she's fair I love.

157
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:07,370
A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.

158
00:14:08,293 --> 00:14:11,603
Well, in that hit you miss.
She'll not be hit with Cupid's arrow;

159
00:14:11,693 --> 00:14:14,082
...nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes...

160
00:14:14,173 --> 00:14:16,562
...nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.

161
00:14:16,653 --> 00:14:19,326
Then she hath sworn
that she will still live chaste?

162
00:14:19,413 --> 00:14:22,007
She hath, and in that sparing
makes huge waste.

163
00:14:22,093 --> 00:14:25,688
- Be ruled by me. Forget to think of her.
- Teach me how I should forget to think.

164
00:14:25,773 --> 00:14:28,606
By giving liberty unto thine eyes.
Examine other beauties.

165
00:14:29,373 --> 00:14:31,284
Why, Romeo, art thou mad?

166
00:14:31,373 --> 00:14:33,967
Not mad,
but bound more than a madman is.

167
00:14:34,053 --> 00:14:37,250
Shut up in prison, kept without
my food, whipp'd and tormented.

168
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:38,243
Good day, good fellow.

169
00:14:40,933 --> 00:14:42,685
(TV) Now, I'll tell you without asking.

170
00:14:42,773 --> 00:14:46,243
The great rich Capulet
holds an old accustom'd feast.

171
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:49,291
A fair assembly. Signor Placentio
and his wife and daughters...

172
00:14:49,373 --> 00:14:53,889
...the lady widow of Utruvio, mmm,
and her lovely nieces Rosaline...

173
00:14:53,973 --> 00:14:56,771
At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
sups the fair Rosaline...

174
00:14:56,853 --> 00:14:59,287
...whom thou so loves, with
all the admired beauties of Verona.

175
00:14:59,373 --> 00:15:03,286
If you be not of the House of Montague,
come and crush a cup of wine!

176
00:15:03,373 --> 00:15:05,648
Go thither, and with unattainted eye...

177
00:15:05,733 --> 00:15:08,452
...compare her face with some
that I shall show...

178
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:11,252
...and I will make thee think thy swan a crow.

179
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,801
I'll go along, no such sight to be shown...

180
00:15:13,893 --> 00:15:16,487
...but to rejoice in splendour of mine own.

181
00:15:21,733 --> 00:15:25,282
Juliet!

182
00:15:27,813 --> 00:15:29,007
Juliet!

183
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,130
Juliet!

184
00:15:31,893 --> 00:15:32,882
Juliet!

185
00:15:33,213 --> 00:15:34,202
(gasps) Oh!

186
00:15:35,613 --> 00:15:37,012
Ooh!

187
00:15:39,693 --> 00:15:40,762
(elevator pings)

188
00:15:41,293 --> 00:15:42,646
Nurse!

189
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,849
Nurse, where's my daughter?
Call her forth to me.

190
00:15:44,933 --> 00:15:46,730
I bade her come. God forbid!

191
00:15:48,413 --> 00:15:50,290
Julieta!

192
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,522
Juliet!

193
00:15:56,733 --> 00:15:58,371
Juliet!

194
00:16:00,453 --> 00:16:03,843
Juliet!

195
00:16:03,933 --> 00:16:06,003
Madam, I am here. What is your will?

196
00:16:08,813 --> 00:16:11,646
O nurse, give us leave awhile.
We must talk in secret.

197
00:16:13,413 --> 00:16:16,689
Nurse, come back again!
I have remembered me.

198
00:16:16,773 --> 00:16:18,684
Thou's hear our counsel.

199
00:16:18,773 --> 00:16:21,924
Nurse, thou knowest
my daughter's of a pretty age.

200
00:16:22,013 --> 00:16:24,208
Thou wast the prettiest babe
that e'er I nursed.

201
00:16:24,293 --> 00:16:27,285
By my count, I was your mother
much upon these years.

202
00:16:29,373 --> 00:16:31,364
You are now a maid.

203
00:16:31,453 --> 00:16:33,444
Thus then in brief!

204
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:36,971
The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.

205
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,404
A man, young lady!

206
00:16:39,493 --> 00:16:42,963
Lady, such a man as all the world.
Why, he's a man of wax!

207
00:16:43,053 --> 00:16:45,487
Verona's summer hath not such a flower...

208
00:16:45,573 --> 00:16:47,689
Nay, he's a flower. In faith, a very flower...

209
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:48,728
Nurse!

210
00:16:48,813 --> 00:16:50,644
This night you shall behold him at our feast.

211
00:16:50,733 --> 00:16:54,089
Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face
and find delight writ there...

212
00:16:54,173 --> 00:16:55,686
...with beauty's pen.

213
00:16:55,773 --> 00:16:59,607
This... precious book of love,
this unbound lover...

214
00:16:59,693 --> 00:17:02,161
...to beautify him, only lacks a cover.

215
00:17:02,253 --> 00:17:04,892
So shall you share all that he doth possess...

216
00:17:04,973 --> 00:17:07,851
...by having him making yourself no less.

217
00:17:09,373 --> 00:17:11,329
Nay, bigger. Women grow by men.

218
00:17:13,253 --> 00:17:13,969
Oh!

219
00:17:18,973 --> 00:17:21,487
Speak briefly, could you like of Paris's love?

220
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:24,485
I'll look to like, if looking liking move.

221
00:17:24,573 --> 00:17:26,643
But no more deep will I endart mine eye...

222
00:17:26,733 --> 00:17:29,247
...than your consent gives strength
to make it fly.

223
00:17:30,773 --> 00:17:31,808
(door opens)

224
00:17:32,453 --> 00:17:33,886
Madam, the guests are come.

225
00:17:33,973 --> 00:17:35,167
Go!

226
00:17:35,253 --> 00:17:36,732
We follow thee.

227
00:17:38,693 --> 00:17:39,967
Juliet! Ugh!

228
00:17:46,493 --> 00:17:49,690
Go, girl. Seek happy nights to happy days.

229
00:18:00,453 --> 00:18:01,602

231
00:18:36,133 --> 00:18:38,203

00:18:38,293 --> 00:18:40,488
- Die a beggar!

# Like Rosaline and thee

244
00:19:24,613 --> 00:19:27,081
Nay, gentle Romeo,
we must have you dance.

245
00:19:27,173 --> 00:19:28,606
Not I. Not l, believe me.

246
00:19:28,693 --> 00:19:32,049
You have dancing shoes with
nimble soles. I have a soul of lead.

247
00:19:32,133 --> 00:19:33,407
You are a lover.

248
00:19:33,493 --> 00:19:36,087
Borrow Cupid's wings and soar
with them above a common bound.

249
00:19:36,173 --> 00:19:38,368
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.

250
00:19:39,093 --> 00:19:41,846
Too great oppression for a tender thing.

251
00:19:41,933 --> 00:19:43,491
Is love a tender thing? It is too rough...

252
00:19:43,573 --> 00:19:46,406
...too rude, too boisterous,
and it pricks like thorn.

253
00:19:46,493 --> 00:19:48,609
If love be rough with you, be rough with love.

254
00:19:48,693 --> 00:19:51,526
Prick love for pricking,
and you beat love down.

255
00:19:53,413 --> 00:19:55,802
Every man, betake him to his legs!

256
00:19:55,893 --> 00:19:58,646
Come, we burn daylight, ho! Ho-o!

257
00:19:58,733 --> 00:19:59,961
(all) Ho-o!

258
00:20:00,053 --> 00:20:03,011
- But 'tis no wit to go!
- Why, may one ask?

259
00:20:03,093 --> 00:20:05,084
- I dreamt a dream tonight.
- And so did I.

260
00:20:05,173 --> 00:20:07,528
- And what was yours?
- That dreamers often lie.

261
00:20:07,613 --> 00:20:10,081
In bed asleep,
while they do dream things true.

262
00:20:10,173 --> 00:20:13,722
O! Then I see
Queen Mab hath been with you.

263
00:20:14,533 --> 00:20:16,251
She is the fairies' midwife...

264
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:19,166
...and she comes in shape
no bigger than an agate-stone...

265
00:20:19,253 --> 00:20:22,404
...on the forefinger of an alderman...

266
00:20:22,493 --> 00:20:25,963
...drawn with a team of little atomies...

267
00:20:26,813 --> 00:20:29,725
...over men's noses as they lie asleep.

268
00:20:30,493 --> 00:20:33,610
Her chariot is an empty hazelnut...

269
00:20:34,613 --> 00:20:38,208
...her waggoner a small grey-coated gnat.

270
00:20:38,293 --> 00:20:43,606
And in this state she gallops
night by night through lovers' brains...

271
00:20:43,693 --> 00:20:45,684
...and then they dream of...

272
00:20:46,573 --> 00:20:47,642
...love;

273
00:20:47,733 --> 00:20:50,884
...o'er lawyers' fingers,
who straight dream on fees.

274
00:20:50,973 --> 00:20:53,441
Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck...

275
00:20:53,533 --> 00:20:56,684
...and then dreams he
of cutting foreign throats;

276
00:20:56,773 --> 00:21:00,561
...and, being thus frighted, swears
a prayer or two, and sleeps again.

277
00:21:00,653 --> 00:21:04,532
This is the hag,
when maids lie on their backs...

278
00:21:04,613 --> 00:21:08,572
...that presses them
and learns them first to bear...

279
00:21:08,653 --> 00:21:12,009
...making them women of good carriage!

280
00:21:12,093 --> 00:21:13,572
This is she!

281
00:21:14,013 --> 00:21:16,732
This is she!

282
00:21:28,213 --> 00:21:30,090
Peace, good Mercutio, peace!

283
00:21:31,133 --> 00:21:33,124
Thou talk'st of nothing.

284
00:21:35,493 --> 00:21:37,484
True.

285
00:21:39,453 --> 00:21:41,444
I talk of dreams...

286
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:44,650
...which are the children of an idle brain...

287
00:21:44,733 --> 00:21:47,372
...begot of nothing but vain fantasy;

288
00:21:47,453 --> 00:21:52,288
...which is as thin of substance as the air
and more inconstant than the wind...

289
00:21:52,373 --> 00:21:55,171
...who woos even now
the frozen bosom of the north...

290
00:21:55,253 --> 00:21:57,926
...and, being angered,
puffs away from thence...

291
00:21:58,013 --> 00:22:00,652
...turning aside to the dew-dropping south.

292
00:22:00,733 --> 00:22:03,725
This wind you talk of
blows us from ourselves!

293
00:22:03,813 --> 00:22:06,805
Supper is done, and we shall come too late!

294
00:22:07,053 --> 00:22:09,044
I fear, too early.

295
00:22:09,133 --> 00:22:14,605
For my mind misgives some... consequence,
yet hanging in the stars...

296
00:22:15,933 --> 00:22:19,926
...shall bitterly begin his fearful date
with this night's revels...

297
00:22:20,013 --> 00:22:22,004
...and expire the term...

298
00:22:22,093 --> 00:22:25,881
...of a despised life closed within my breast...

299
00:22:27,613 --> 00:22:30,605
...by some vile forfeit of untimely death.

300
00:22:32,413 --> 00:22:35,007
But he that hath the steerage of my course...

301
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:38,005
...direct my sail!

302
00:22:49,933 --> 00:22:51,730
(Romeo) On, lusty gentlemen!

303
00:22:52,053 --> 00:22:59,050
# Young hearts

304
00:23:00,533 --> 00:23:06,881
# Run free

305
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:28,842
Grr!

306
00:23:28,933 --> 00:23:30,730
Thy drugs are quick.

307
00:23:33,933 --> 00:23:35,924

308
00:23:36,013 --> 00:23:37,844

00:23:45,453 --> 00:23:47,171
# And me

# Don't be no fool

# When love really don't love you

317
00:24:00,413 --> 00:24:02,404
# I said don't love you

318
00:24:04,613 --> 00:24:06,683
I have seen the day that I could tell...

319
00:24:06,773 --> 00:24:09,890
...a whispering tale in a fair lady's ear
such as would please.

320
00:24:09,973 --> 00:24:11,770
# Amore! Amore!

321
00:24:11,853 --> 00:24:12,922
# Amore...

322
00:24:15,533 --> 00:24:16,522
Whoo!

# Pride can stand a thousand trials

324
00:25:01,653 --> 00:25:07,125
# The strong will never fall

00:25:08,013 --> 00:25:13,804
# But watching stars without you

326
00:25:13,893 --> 00:25:18,250
# My soul cried

# Heaving heart

328
00:25:27,413 --> 00:25:34,728
# Is full of pain

329
00:25:36,133 --> 00:25:42,288
# Oh, oh

330
00:25:42,373 --> 00:25:49,449
# The aching

331
00:25:51,493 --> 00:26:01,084
# Coœ I'm kissing you

332
00:26:01,173 --> 00:26:05,246
# Oh

333
00:26:05,333 --> 00:26:18,883
# I'm kissing you

334
00:26:18,973 --> 00:26:20,964
Madam, your mother calls!

335
00:26:21,053 --> 00:26:24,250
# Touch me deep

336
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:32,205
# Pure and true

337
00:26:34,293 --> 00:26:36,648
Will you now deny to dance?

338
00:26:36,733 --> 00:26:39,327
A man, young lady. Such a man!

339
00:26:50,133 --> 00:26:51,327
What!

340
00:26:51,413 --> 00:26:55,008
Dares that slave come hither
to fleer and scorn at our solemnity?

341
00:26:55,093 --> 00:26:59,962
Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
to strike him dead I hold it not a sin!

342
00:27:00,573 --> 00:27:03,292
Why, how now, kinsman!
Wherefore storm you so?

343
00:27:03,373 --> 00:27:06,285
Uncle, this is that villain Romeo.
A Montague, our foe.

344
00:27:06,373 --> 00:27:08,364
- Romeo is it?
- 'Tis he.

345
00:27:08,453 --> 00:27:11,445
Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone.

346
00:27:11,533 --> 00:27:13,888
I would not for the wealth of all this town...

347
00:27:13,973 --> 00:27:16,282
...here in my house do him disparagement.

348
00:27:16,373 --> 00:27:18,807
Therefore be patient, take no note of him.

349
00:27:18,893 --> 00:27:20,212
Uncle, I'll not endure him.

350
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:23,364
He shall be endured.

351
00:27:24,293 --> 00:27:25,442
Go to!

352
00:27:25,533 --> 00:27:27,763
What, goodman boy? I say he shall!

353
00:27:27,853 --> 00:27:29,002
Go to!

354
00:27:29,093 --> 00:27:30,685
Uncle, 'tis a shame.

355
00:27:30,773 --> 00:27:32,604
Make a mutiny among my guests?

356
00:27:50,973 --> 00:27:52,725
Did my heart love till now?

357
00:27:53,733 --> 00:27:55,724
Forswear it, sight.

358
00:27:55,813 --> 00:27:58,771
For I never saw true beauty till this night.

359
00:27:59,813 --> 00:28:09,802
# Where are you now?

360
00:28:10,653 --> 00:28:21,484
# Where are you now?

361
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:37,207
# Coœ I'm kissing you

362
00:28:38,453 --> 00:28:54,290
# I'm kissing you now

363
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:20,364
If I profane with my unworthiest hand
this holy shrine...

364
00:29:20,453 --> 00:29:22,444
...the gentle sin is this.

365
00:29:28,053 --> 00:29:31,602
My lips, two blushing pilgrims,
ready stand...

366
00:29:31,693 --> 00:29:35,447
...to smooth that rough touch
with a tender kiss.

367
00:29:35,813 --> 00:29:38,486
Good pilgrim,
you do wrong your hand too much...

368
00:29:38,573 --> 00:29:40,848
...which mannerly devotion shows in this.

369
00:29:40,933 --> 00:29:44,972
For saints have hands
that pilgrims' hands do touch...

370
00:29:45,053 --> 00:29:48,329
...and palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.

371
00:29:48,813 --> 00:29:52,249
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?

372
00:29:52,773 --> 00:29:56,083
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.

373
00:29:56,613 --> 00:29:59,286
Well, then, dear saint,
let lips do what hands do.

374
00:29:59,373 --> 00:30:02,604
They pray, grant thou,
lest faith turn to despair.

375
00:30:02,693 --> 00:30:06,572
Saints do not move,
though grant for prayers' sake.

376
00:30:07,253 --> 00:30:10,086
Then move not,
while my prayer's effect I take.

377
00:30:10,173 --> 00:30:11,765
- Yoo-hoo!
- (elevator pings)

378
00:30:14,453 --> 00:30:15,090
Dave!

379
00:30:17,013 --> 00:30:18,162
Oh! Agh!

380
00:30:20,453 --> 00:30:20,930
Ugh!

381
00:30:26,093 --> 00:30:29,165
Thus from my lips,
by thine, my sin is purged.

382
00:30:29,253 --> 00:30:31,209
Then have my lips the sin
that they have took?

383
00:30:31,293 --> 00:30:34,012
Sin from my lips?
O trespass sweetly urged!

384
00:30:34,093 --> 00:30:35,651
Give me my sin again.

385
00:30:38,373 --> 00:30:40,364
You kiss by the book.

386
00:30:47,733 --> 00:30:49,610
Juliet! Juliet! Oh!

387
00:30:49,893 --> 00:30:51,485
Juliet?

388
00:30:52,133 --> 00:30:53,282
Juliet!

389
00:31:02,053 --> 00:31:04,886
Madam, your mother craves a word with you.

390
00:31:06,693 --> 00:31:08,285
Come, let's away!

391
00:31:34,253 --> 00:31:36,448
Is she a Capulet?

392
00:31:38,133 --> 00:31:41,170
His name is Romeo, and he's a Montague...

393
00:31:41,253 --> 00:31:43,721
...the only son of your great enemy.

394
00:32:02,813 --> 00:32:05,725
Away, be gone. The sport is at its best.

395
00:32:06,213 --> 00:32:08,727
Ay, so I fear. The more is my unrest.

396
00:32:39,813 --> 00:32:44,045
I am a pretty piece of flesh!

397
00:32:44,293 --> 00:32:48,923
(chanting) I am a pretty piece of flesh!

398
00:32:49,253 --> 00:32:54,043
I am a pretty piece of flesh! I am!

399
00:33:02,293 --> 00:33:04,932
My only love sprung from my only hate!

400
00:33:05,813 --> 00:33:08,885
Too early seen unknown, and known too late!

401
00:33:08,973 --> 00:33:13,842
Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
that I must love a loathed enemy.

402
00:33:26,253 --> 00:33:28,323
I will withdraw.

403
00:33:28,413 --> 00:33:31,849
But this intrusion shall,
now seeming sweet...

404
00:33:31,933 --> 00:33:34,322
...convert to bitterest gall.

405
00:33:37,773 --> 00:33:40,287
(chanting) A pretty piece of flesh! I am!

406
00:33:42,133 --> 00:33:44,647
A pretty piece of...

407
00:33:44,733 --> 00:33:45,722
Romeo!

408
00:33:45,813 --> 00:33:47,610
- Romeo!
- Romeo!

409
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:48,648
Romeo!

410
00:33:48,773 --> 00:33:51,162
Humours! Madman!

411
00:33:51,413 --> 00:33:54,007
Passion! Lover!

412
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:57,331
I will conjure thee
by Rosaline's bright eyes...

413
00:33:57,413 --> 00:34:00,371
...by her high forehead
and her scarlet lip...

414
00:34:00,453 --> 00:34:04,492
...by her fine foot, straight leg,
and quivering thigh!

415
00:34:08,133 --> 00:34:12,411
O Romeo, that she were an open-ass
and thou a poperin pear!

416
00:34:12,493 --> 00:34:14,927
He jests at scars that never felt the wound.

417
00:34:15,013 --> 00:34:15,684
Romeo!

418
00:34:16,893 --> 00:34:17,962
(Mercutio) Good night!

419
00:34:18,053 --> 00:34:22,524
I'll to my truckle-bed.
This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.

420
00:34:43,613 --> 00:34:45,012
Oh!

421
00:34:53,453 --> 00:34:54,442
(clatter)

422
00:34:54,533 --> 00:34:56,046
(dog barks)

423
00:34:59,773 --> 00:35:01,445
But soft!

424
00:35:01,533 --> 00:35:03,763
What light through yonder window breaks?

425
00:35:09,573 --> 00:35:11,564
It is the east...

426
00:35:11,653 --> 00:35:14,406
...and Juliet is the sun!

427
00:35:18,213 --> 00:35:21,842
Arise, fair sun,
and kill the envious moon...

428
00:35:21,933 --> 00:35:24,527
...who is already sick and pale with grief...

429
00:35:24,613 --> 00:35:28,401
...that thou, her maid,
art far more fair than she.

430
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:31,565
Be not her maid, since she is envious.

431
00:35:31,653 --> 00:35:35,851
Her vestal livery is but sick and green,
and none but fools do wear it.

432
00:35:38,093 --> 00:35:40,971
O cast it off!

433
00:35:46,173 --> 00:35:47,367
(elevator)

434
00:35:49,813 --> 00:35:52,202
It is my lady, it is my love.

435
00:35:52,693 --> 00:35:54,684
O that she knew she were.

436
00:36:02,093 --> 00:36:03,287
Ay me!

437
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:08,364
She speaks.

438
00:36:08,453 --> 00:36:10,444
Speak again, bright angel.

439
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:13,652
Romeo.

440
00:36:14,933 --> 00:36:16,571
O Romeo!

441
00:36:16,653 --> 00:36:18,644
Wherefore art thou Romeo?

442
00:36:23,133 --> 00:36:25,328
Deny thy father and refuse thy name.

443
00:36:25,413 --> 00:36:30,123
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
and I'll no longer be a Capulet.

444
00:36:31,693 --> 00:36:33,684
Shall I hear more...

445
00:36:33,773 --> 00:36:35,684
...or shall I speak at this?

446
00:36:35,773 --> 00:36:38,162
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.

447
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:41,332
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.

448
00:36:41,413 --> 00:36:43,369
What's Montague?

449
00:36:43,453 --> 00:36:45,250
It is not hand...

450
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:47,722
...nor foot, nor arm, nor face...

451
00:36:49,853 --> 00:36:52,845
...nor any other part belonging to a man.

452
00:36:53,413 --> 00:36:55,404
O be some other name!

453
00:36:57,693 --> 00:36:59,684
What's in a name?

454
00:37:00,253 --> 00:37:04,292
That which we call a rose by
any other word would smell as sweet.

455
00:37:04,373 --> 00:37:07,490
So Romeo would,
were he not Romeo called...

456
00:37:07,573 --> 00:37:12,169
...retain that dear perfection
which he owes without that title.

457
00:37:13,253 --> 00:37:15,130
Romeo, doff thy name;

458
00:37:15,213 --> 00:37:18,603
...and for thy name, which is
no part of thee, take all myself.

459
00:37:18,693 --> 00:37:20,684
- I take thee at thy word.
- Agh!

460
00:37:30,933 --> 00:37:32,924
Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?

461
00:37:33,013 --> 00:37:35,288
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.

462
00:37:35,373 --> 00:37:37,728
How camest thou hither, tell me,
and wherefore?

463
00:37:37,813 --> 00:37:39,769
The garden walls are high
and hard to climb...

464
00:37:39,853 --> 00:37:42,208
...and the place death,
considering who thou art.

465
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:44,887
With love's light wings
did I o'erperch these walls...

466
00:37:44,973 --> 00:37:46,964
...for stony limits cannot hold love out...

467
00:37:47,053 --> 00:37:49,408
...and what love can do,
that dares love attempt.

468
00:37:49,493 --> 00:37:52,132
Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me!

469
00:38:13,813 --> 00:38:16,611
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.

470
00:38:20,573 --> 00:38:23,883
I have night's cloak
to hide me from their eyes.

471
00:38:24,133 --> 00:38:26,124
But thou love me...

472
00:38:26,213 --> 00:38:28,204
...let them find me here.

473
00:38:28,693 --> 00:38:33,289
My life were better ended by their hate
than death prorogued...

474
00:38:36,293 --> 00:38:38,284
...wanting of thy love.

475
00:39:16,053 --> 00:39:18,521
Thou knowest
the mask of night is on my face;

476
00:39:18,613 --> 00:39:20,922
...else would a maiden blush
bepaint my cheek...

477
00:39:21,013 --> 00:39:23,573
...for that which thou hast
heard me speak tonight.

478
00:39:23,653 --> 00:39:25,644
Fain would I dwell on form...

479
00:39:25,733 --> 00:39:27,769
...fain, fain deny what I have spoke.

480
00:39:27,853 --> 00:39:30,242
But... farewell compliment.

481
00:39:31,893 --> 00:39:33,884
Dost thou love me?

482
00:39:35,493 --> 00:39:37,961
I know thou wilt say "Ay",
and I will take thy word.

483
00:39:38,053 --> 00:39:40,487
Yet, if thou swear'st,
thou may'st prove false.

484
00:39:40,573 --> 00:39:43,929
O gentle Romeo, if thou dost love,
pronounce it faithfully.

485
00:39:44,013 --> 00:39:46,402
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I vow...

486
00:39:46,493 --> 00:39:49,690
...that tips with silver all these fruit tree tops...

487
00:39:49,773 --> 00:39:51,764
O swear not by the moon...

488
00:39:51,853 --> 00:39:55,562
...the inconstant moon that monthly
changes in her circled orb...

489
00:39:55,653 --> 00:39:58,372
...lest that thy love prove likewise variable.

490
00:39:58,453 --> 00:40:01,092
(chuckles) What shall I swear by?

491
00:40:01,173 --> 00:40:03,164
Do not swear at all.

492
00:40:03,253 --> 00:40:05,244
Or, if thou wilt...

493
00:40:05,333 --> 00:40:09,121
...swear by thy gracious self
which is the god of my idolatry...

494
00:40:09,213 --> 00:40:11,204
...and I'll believe thee.

495
00:40:11,653 --> 00:40:13,644
If my heart's...

496
00:40:14,173 --> 00:40:16,164
...dear love...

497
00:40:25,453 --> 00:40:30,811
Do not swear. Although I joy in thee,
I have no joy in this contract tonight.

498
00:40:30,893 --> 00:40:34,203
It is too rash, too unadvised,
too sudden, too like the lightning...

499
00:40:34,293 --> 00:40:36,853
...which doth cease to be
ere one can say "It lightens".

500
00:40:36,933 --> 00:40:38,332
Sweet, good night!

501
00:40:38,413 --> 00:40:41,007
This bud of love,
by summer's ripening breath...

502
00:40:41,093 --> 00:40:43,732
...may prove a beauteous flower
when next we meet.

503
00:40:43,813 --> 00:40:44,848
Good night.

504
00:40:46,293 --> 00:40:47,772
Good night!

505
00:40:50,093 --> 00:40:52,049
O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

506
00:40:54,093 --> 00:40:56,482
What satisfaction canst thou have tonight?

507
00:40:58,493 --> 00:41:01,963
The exchange of thy love's
faithful vow for mine.

508
00:41:05,413 --> 00:41:08,291
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it!

509
00:41:18,093 --> 00:41:19,572
Juliet!

510
00:41:27,213 --> 00:41:29,522
Three words, dear Romeo,
and good night indeed.

511
00:41:29,613 --> 00:41:32,571
If that thy bent of love be honourable,
thy purpose marriage...

512
00:41:32,653 --> 00:41:35,451
...send me word tomorrow, by one
that I'll procure to come to thee...

513
00:41:35,533 --> 00:41:37,728
...where and what time thou wilt
perform the rite...

514
00:41:37,813 --> 00:41:39,690
...and all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay...

515
00:41:39,773 --> 00:41:41,923
...and follow thee, my lord,
throughout the world.

516
00:41:42,013 --> 00:41:43,128
Julieta!

517
00:41:43,733 --> 00:41:45,769
Ay! By and by, I come!

518
00:41:45,853 --> 00:41:48,731
But if thou meanest not well,
I do beseech thee...

519
00:41:48,813 --> 00:41:50,804
- Juliet!
- By and by, I come!

520
00:41:50,893 --> 00:41:53,566
...to cease thy strife,
and leave me to my grief.

521
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:56,731
Tomorrow will I send.

522
00:41:56,813 --> 00:41:58,644
So thrive my soul.

523
00:42:06,053 --> 00:42:07,930
A thousand times good night.

524
00:42:08,013 --> 00:42:11,050
A thousand times the worse,
to want thy light!

525
00:42:12,253 --> 00:42:13,402
Juliet!

526
00:42:15,293 --> 00:42:16,885
Julieta!

527
00:42:21,013 --> 00:42:22,731
Good night.

528
00:42:25,053 --> 00:42:28,887
Love goes toward love
as schoolboys from their books;

529
00:42:30,213 --> 00:42:32,204
...but love from love...

530
00:42:33,493 --> 00:42:35,723
...toward school with heavy looks.

531
00:42:36,293 --> 00:42:38,090
- (window opens)
- Romeo!

532
00:42:38,893 --> 00:42:40,770
What o'clock tomorrow
shall I send to thee?

533
00:42:41,813 --> 00:42:43,804
By the hour of nine.

534
00:42:43,893 --> 00:42:46,965
I will not fail. 'Tis twenty year till then.

535
00:42:47,413 --> 00:42:49,131
Good night.

536
00:42:56,573 --> 00:42:58,291
Good night. Good night.

537
00:43:07,413 --> 00:43:09,404
Parting is such sweet sorrow...

538
00:43:09,493 --> 00:43:12,610
...that I shall say good night till it be morrow.

539
00:43:14,253 --> 00:43:17,882
Juliet!

540
00:43:18,133 --> 00:43:21,808
# You and me always

541
00:43:21,893 --> 00:43:24,282
# And for ever

542
00:43:24,373 --> 00:43:27,809
# You and me always

543
00:43:27,893 --> 00:43:30,691
# And for ever

544
00:43:30,773 --> 00:43:35,608
# Ba ba-ba ba-ba

545
00:43:35,693 --> 00:43:39,049
# It was always you and me...

546
00:43:39,853 --> 00:43:44,643
Almighty is the powerful grace
that lies in plants, herbs, stones...

547
00:43:44,733 --> 00:43:46,724
...and their true qualities.

548
00:43:49,853 --> 00:43:52,413
For nought so vile
that on the earth doth live...

549
00:43:52,493 --> 00:43:55,053
...but to the earth
some special good doth give.

550
00:43:57,413 --> 00:44:00,849
And nought so good
but strained from that fair use...

551
00:44:00,933 --> 00:44:03,572
...revolts from true birth,
stumbling on abuse.

552
00:44:04,493 --> 00:44:07,769
Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied...

553
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:11,084
...and vice sometime's by action dignified.

554
00:44:11,173 --> 00:44:15,405
Within the infant rind of this... weak flower...

555
00:44:15,493 --> 00:44:18,132
...poison is resident...

556
00:44:18,213 --> 00:44:20,443
...and medicine power.

557
00:44:20,533 --> 00:44:24,412
For this, being smelt,
with that part cheers each part.

558
00:44:24,493 --> 00:44:26,051
Being tasted...

559
00:44:26,133 --> 00:44:30,285
...slays all senses with the heart.

560
00:44:31,533 --> 00:44:35,606
Two such opposed kings encamp them still
in man as well as herbs...

561
00:44:35,693 --> 00:44:37,684
...grace and rude will.

562
00:44:37,773 --> 00:44:42,051
And where the worser is predominant,
full soon the canker death...

563
00:44:42,133 --> 00:44:43,964
...eats up that plant.

564
00:44:44,053 --> 00:44:46,044
Good morrow, Father!

565
00:44:46,133 --> 00:44:47,964
Benedicite!

566
00:44:49,173 --> 00:44:52,085
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?

567
00:44:52,813 --> 00:44:54,451
(boys) Good morrow, Romeo.

568
00:44:54,533 --> 00:44:56,410
Good morrow.

569
00:44:56,493 --> 00:44:58,961
Young son, it argues a distemper'd head...

570
00:44:59,053 --> 00:45:01,567
...so soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.

571
00:45:02,413 --> 00:45:05,132
Or if not so, then here I hit it right...

572
00:45:05,773 --> 00:45:08,571
Our Romeo hath not seen his bed tonight!

573
00:45:09,453 --> 00:45:12,331
The last is true-the sweeter rest was mine.

574
00:45:12,413 --> 00:45:14,688
God pardon sin! Wast thou with Rosaline?

575
00:45:14,773 --> 00:45:16,889
Rosaline? My ghostly father, no!

576
00:45:16,973 --> 00:45:19,362
I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.

577
00:45:19,453 --> 00:45:22,172
That's my good son.
But where then hast thou been?

578
00:45:22,253 --> 00:45:25,848
I have been feasting with mine enemy,
where on a sudden one hath wounded me...

579
00:45:25,933 --> 00:45:27,491
...that's by me wounded.

580
00:45:27,573 --> 00:45:30,451
Both our remedies within thy help
and holy physic lies.

581
00:45:30,533 --> 00:45:32,967
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift.

582
00:45:33,053 --> 00:45:35,692
Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.

583
00:45:35,773 --> 00:45:38,606
Then plainly know
my heart's dear love is set...

584
00:45:38,693 --> 00:45:41,332
...on the fair daughter of rich Capulet.

585
00:45:41,893 --> 00:45:43,884
We met, we wooed...

586
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:46,524
...we made exchange of vow.

587
00:45:47,533 --> 00:45:50,684
I'll tell thee as we pass, but this I pray...

588
00:45:50,773 --> 00:45:53,412
...that thou consent to marry us today.

589
00:45:55,773 --> 00:45:57,889
Holy Saint Francis!

590
00:45:57,973 --> 00:45:59,964
What a change is here!

591
00:46:00,053 --> 00:46:04,171
Is Rosaline, that thou didst love
so dear, so soon forsaken?

592
00:46:04,253 --> 00:46:08,644
Young men's love then lies not truly
in their hearts, but in their eyes.

593
00:46:09,173 --> 00:46:11,528
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.

594
00:46:11,613 --> 00:46:14,411
For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.

595
00:46:17,613 --> 00:46:19,205
I pray thee...

596
00:46:20,173 --> 00:46:21,652
...chide me not!

597
00:46:21,733 --> 00:46:25,521
Her I love now doth grace for grace
and love for love allow.

598
00:46:25,613 --> 00:46:27,604
The other did not so.

599
00:46:27,693 --> 00:46:29,684
Yes, she well knew...

600
00:46:29,773 --> 00:46:33,243
...thy love did read by rote,
that could not spell.

601
00:46:36,653 --> 00:46:42,683
# Maybe I'm just like my mother

602
00:46:42,773 --> 00:46:47,403
# She's never satisfied

603
00:46:47,493 --> 00:46:51,645
For this alliance may so happy prove...

604
00:46:51,733 --> 00:46:55,123
...to turn your households'rancour...

605
00:46:55,213 --> 00:46:56,965
...to pure love.

606
00:46:57,053 --> 00:46:59,647
# This is what it sounds like

607
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:03,931
# When doves cry

608
00:47:05,493 --> 00:47:08,405
Come, young waverer, come, go with me.

609
00:47:08,653 --> 00:47:11,292
In one respect I'll thy assistant be.

610
00:47:12,853 --> 00:47:15,526
For this alliance may so happy prove...

611
00:47:15,613 --> 00:47:18,366
...to turn your households' rancour
to pure love.

612
00:47:18,453 --> 00:47:20,409
O let us hence! I stand on sudden haste!

613
00:47:23,573 --> 00:47:26,724
Wisely and slow. They stumble that run fast.

614
00:47:27,813 --> 00:47:31,089
# Maybe I'm just too demanding

615
00:47:31,173 --> 00:47:34,882
# Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold

616
00:47:34,973 --> 00:47:38,443
# Maybe I'm just like my mother

617
00:47:38,533 --> 00:47:42,492
# She's never satisfied

618
00:47:42,573 --> 00:47:44,450
# Why do we scream at each other?

619
00:47:57,093 --> 00:47:59,084
# This is what it sounds like

620
00:48:00,813 --> 00:48:02,804
# This is what it sounds like

621
00:48:04,053 --> 00:48:06,123
# This is what it sounds like

622
00:48:06,213 --> 00:48:09,728
Where the devil should this Romeo be?
Came he not home tonight?

623
00:48:09,813 --> 00:48:12,691
Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.

624
00:48:12,773 --> 00:48:16,448
Why, that same pale hard-hearted
wench, that Rosaline...

625
00:48:16,533 --> 00:48:19,047
...torments him so, that he will sure run mad.

626
00:48:19,133 --> 00:48:21,852
Tybalt hath sent a letter to his father's house.

627
00:48:21,933 --> 00:48:24,686
- A challenge, on my life!
- Romeo will answer it?

628
00:48:24,773 --> 00:48:26,889
Any man that can write may answer a letter.

629
00:48:26,973 --> 00:48:30,249
Nay, he will answer the letter's master,
how he dares being dared.

630
00:48:30,333 --> 00:48:35,532
Well, alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead!
Stabbed with a white wench's black eye!

631
00:48:35,613 --> 00:48:37,569
Run through the ear with a love-song!

632
00:48:37,653 --> 00:48:40,804
The very pin of his heart cleft
with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft!

633
00:48:40,893 --> 00:48:43,123
And is he a man to encounter Tybalt?

634
00:48:43,213 --> 00:48:46,444
- Why, what is Tybalt?
- More than Prince of Cats.

635
00:48:47,013 --> 00:48:50,449
He is the courageous captain of compliments!

636
00:48:51,293 --> 00:48:53,966
He fights as you sing pricksong.

637
00:48:54,973 --> 00:48:57,771
Keeps time, distance, and proportion.

638
00:48:58,293 --> 00:49:00,409
He rests his minim rests.

639
00:49:00,493 --> 00:49:03,724
One, two, and a third...

640
00:49:03,813 --> 00:49:04,768
...in your bosom.

641
00:49:04,853 --> 00:49:07,242
The very butcher of a silk button.

642
00:49:07,693 --> 00:49:09,172
A duellist.

643
00:49:09,253 --> 00:49:12,609
A duellist! A gentleman
of the very first house...

644
00:49:12,693 --> 00:49:14,684
...of the first and second cause.

645
00:49:14,773 --> 00:49:16,764
The immortal passado!

646
00:49:18,253 --> 00:49:20,244
The punto reverso!

647
00:49:20,733 --> 00:49:21,961
The, um... hai!

648
00:49:22,053 --> 00:49:24,647
- The what?
- (laughs)

649
00:49:24,733 --> 00:49:26,724
Here comes Romeo.

650
00:49:27,653 --> 00:49:28,847
Romeo!

651
00:49:31,693 --> 00:49:33,684
Ho-ho, taffeta punk!

652
00:49:33,773 --> 00:49:35,764
Signor Romeo, bonjour!

653
00:49:36,533 --> 00:49:39,445
There's a French salutation
to your French slop.

654
00:49:39,533 --> 00:49:41,888
You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.

655
00:49:41,973 --> 00:49:44,771
Good morrow to you both.
What counterfeit did I give you?

656
00:49:44,853 --> 00:49:47,208
The slip, sir, the slip.
Can you not conceive?

657
00:49:47,293 --> 00:49:49,682
Pardon, good Mercutio.
My business was great...

658
00:49:49,773 --> 00:49:52,162
...and in such a case as mine
a man may strain courtesy.

659
00:49:52,253 --> 00:49:53,447
That's as much as to say...

660
00:49:53,533 --> 00:49:57,242
...such a case as yours
constrains a man to bow in the hams!

661
00:49:57,333 --> 00:50:00,530
- Meaning to curtsy?
- Thou hast most kindly hit it.

662
00:50:00,613 --> 00:50:04,049
- A most courteous exposition.
- Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.

663
00:50:04,133 --> 00:50:06,169
- Pink for flower?
- Right.

664
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:08,642
Why, then is my pump well flowered!

665
00:50:08,733 --> 00:50:10,325
O sure wit!

666
00:50:10,413 --> 00:50:13,610
Now art thou sociable. Now art thou Romeo!

667
00:50:13,693 --> 00:50:17,003
Now art thou what thou art,
by art as well as by nature!

668
00:50:18,253 --> 00:50:20,244
Here's goodly gear!

669
00:50:21,653 --> 00:50:23,769
God ye good e'en, fair gentlewoman.

670
00:50:23,853 --> 00:50:26,242
I desire some confidence with you.

671
00:50:29,373 --> 00:50:30,362
Ooh! A bawd!

672
00:50:30,893 --> 00:50:33,088
(Mercutio) A bawd, a bawd, a bawd!

673
00:50:33,173 --> 00:50:35,403
(all chanting) So ho! So ho!

674
00:50:35,493 --> 00:50:37,131
So ho! So ho!

675
00:50:37,413 --> 00:50:39,290
Romeo!

676
00:50:39,373 --> 00:50:41,170
Romeo!

677
00:50:42,053 --> 00:50:43,247
Romeo!

678
00:50:46,093 --> 00:50:48,084
Will you come to your father's?

679
00:50:48,933 --> 00:50:50,924
We'll to dinner thither.

680
00:50:51,013 --> 00:50:52,731
I will follow you.

681
00:50:54,933 --> 00:50:57,606
(Mercutio) Farewell, ancient lady! Farewell!

682
00:50:59,613 --> 00:51:03,162
If ye should lead her
in a fool's paradise, as they say...

683
00:51:03,253 --> 00:51:06,768
...it were a very gross kind
of behaviour, as they say.

684
00:51:06,853 --> 00:51:08,844
For the lady is young...

685
00:51:08,933 --> 00:51:12,562
...and, therefore, if you should
deal double with her...

686
00:51:12,653 --> 00:51:17,010
...truly it were an ill thing,
and very weak dealing.

687
00:51:18,093 --> 00:51:20,926
Bid her to come to confession
this afternoon...

688
00:51:21,013 --> 00:51:25,768
...and there she shall,
at Friar Laurence's cell, be shrived...

689
00:51:26,653 --> 00:51:28,405
...and married.

690
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:32,130
# Love me, love me

691
00:51:32,213 --> 00:51:34,204
# Say that you love me

692
00:51:34,293 --> 00:51:36,523
# Fool me, fool me

693
00:51:36,773 --> 00:51:38,092
# Go on and fool me

694
00:51:38,173 --> 00:51:40,084
# Love me, love me

695
00:51:40,173 --> 00:51:42,243
# Pretend that you love me

696
00:51:42,333 --> 00:51:44,324
O honey nurse! What news?

697
00:51:45,053 --> 00:51:48,204
- Nurse!
- I am aweary! Give me leave awhile!

698
00:51:48,573 --> 00:51:50,564
Fie, how my bones ache!

699
00:51:51,133 --> 00:51:53,124
What ajaunce have I!

700
00:51:53,493 --> 00:51:55,643
Would thou hadst my bones
and I thy news.

701
00:51:55,733 --> 00:51:57,644
Come, I pray thee, speak!

702
00:51:57,733 --> 00:52:01,442
Jesu, what haste! Can you not stay awhile?

703
00:52:01,533 --> 00:52:03,967
Can you not see that I am out of breath?

704
00:52:04,053 --> 00:52:06,362
How art thou out of breath
when thou hast breath...

705
00:52:06,453 --> 00:52:08,330
...to say to me that thou art out of breath?

706
00:52:09,213 --> 00:52:11,932
Is the news good or bad? Answer to that.

707
00:52:12,013 --> 00:52:15,528
Well, you have made a simple choice.

708
00:52:15,613 --> 00:52:18,081
You know not how to choose a man.

709
00:52:18,173 --> 00:52:21,210
Romeo? No, not he.

710
00:52:21,293 --> 00:52:24,410
Though his face be better than any man's...

711
00:52:24,493 --> 00:52:26,961
...yet his leg excels all men's...

712
00:52:27,053 --> 00:52:29,567
...and for a hand and a foot and a body...

713
00:52:29,653 --> 00:52:30,927
(giggles)

714
00:52:33,373 --> 00:52:36,604
But all this I did know before.
What says he of our marriage?

715
00:52:36,693 --> 00:52:37,682
What of that?

716
00:52:37,773 --> 00:52:40,845
Lord, how my head aches!
What a head have I!

717
00:52:41,293 --> 00:52:43,887
- And my back!
- Ohh...

718
00:52:44,653 --> 00:52:46,609
T'other side!

719
00:52:47,013 --> 00:52:48,605
Oh, my back!

720
00:52:48,693 --> 00:52:51,571
In faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.

721
00:52:51,653 --> 00:52:54,042
Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse!

722
00:52:54,133 --> 00:52:56,328
Tell me, what says my love?

723
00:52:56,413 --> 00:52:58,927
Thy love says, like an honest gentleman...

724
00:52:59,013 --> 00:53:01,732
...and a courteous, and a kind,
and a handsome...

725
00:53:01,813 --> 00:53:03,724
...and, I warrant, a virtuous...

726
00:53:03,813 --> 00:53:06,122
- Where is your mother?
- "Where is your mother?"

727
00:53:06,213 --> 00:53:08,124
How oddly thou repliest!

728
00:53:08,213 --> 00:53:11,046
Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
"Where is your mother?"

729
00:53:11,133 --> 00:53:14,887
God's Lady dear! Are you so hot?
Henceforth, do your messages yourself!

730
00:53:14,973 --> 00:53:18,283
O here's such a coil!
Come, what says Romeo?

731
00:53:23,573 --> 00:53:26,326
Have you got leave
to go to confession today?

732
00:53:28,438 --> 00:53:29,507
I have.

733
00:53:30,718 --> 00:53:34,074
Then hie you hence to Father Laurence' cell.

734
00:53:34,598 --> 00:53:37,874
There stays a husband to make you a wife!

735
00:53:37,958 --> 00:53:39,755
Oh!

736
00:53:40,598 --> 00:53:48,471
# Everybody's free to feel good

737
00:53:49,638 --> 00:53:53,631
# To feel good

738
00:53:55,718 --> 00:53:57,868
# Brother and sister

739
00:53:57,958 --> 00:54:02,076
# Together we'll make it through

740
00:54:03,278 --> 00:54:05,473
# Oh-oh, yeah

741
00:54:06,198 --> 00:54:12,717
# Someday a spirit will take you
and guide you there

742
00:54:15,678 --> 00:54:18,511
# I know you've been hurting

743
00:54:18,598 --> 00:54:23,547
# But I've been waiting to be there for you

744
00:54:25,638 --> 00:54:29,995
# And I'll be there just helping you out

745
00:54:30,078 --> 00:54:35,198
# Whenever I can

746
00:54:35,278 --> 00:54:37,314
(choir) # Everybody's free

747
00:54:37,398 --> 00:54:40,435
# Everybody's free

748
00:54:40,518 --> 00:54:43,794
# Oh, yeah

749
00:54:44,478 --> 00:54:46,753
These violent delights...

750
00:54:46,838 --> 00:54:49,033
...have violent ends.

751
00:54:49,118 --> 00:54:52,474
And in their triumph die
like fire and powder...

752
00:54:52,558 --> 00:54:55,118
...which, as they kiss, consume.

753
00:54:55,198 --> 00:54:59,589
The sweetest honey is loathsome
in his own deliciousness.

754
00:54:59,678 --> 00:55:03,227
Therefore love moderately.

755
00:55:03,318 --> 00:55:06,628
Romeo shall thank thee, daughter,
for us both.

756
00:55:07,758 --> 00:55:10,511
# Oh, to feel good

757
00:55:10,758 --> 00:55:12,430
(thunder)

758
00:55:14,558 --> 00:55:16,355
(gunshot)

759
00:55:18,558 --> 00:55:21,595
(Benvolio) I pray thee,
good Mercutio, let's retire!

760
00:55:21,678 --> 00:55:24,556
The day is hot, the Capels are abroad...

761
00:55:27,998 --> 00:55:30,910
...and if we meet we shall not 'scape a brawl...

762
00:55:30,998 --> 00:55:34,627
...for now, these hot days,
is the mad blood stirring.

763
00:55:34,958 --> 00:55:37,233
We're the Caps! (laughs)

764
00:55:37,318 --> 00:55:38,910
Wha... Wha... Wha...

765
00:55:40,558 --> 00:55:43,118
See? Thou art like one of these fellows...

766
00:55:43,198 --> 00:55:46,190
...that, when he enters
the confines of a tavern...

767
00:55:46,278 --> 00:55:48,917
...claps me his Sword upon the table...

768
00:55:48,998 --> 00:55:51,148
...and says, "God send me no need of thee".

769
00:55:51,238 --> 00:55:54,196
And, by the operation of the second cup...

770
00:55:54,278 --> 00:55:58,032
...draws him on the drawer,
when indeed there is no need.

771
00:55:58,118 --> 00:55:59,995
- Yeah!
- (laughter)

772
00:56:00,678 --> 00:56:02,350
Am I like such a fellow?

773
00:56:02,438 --> 00:56:06,147
Thou art as hot ajack in thy mood
as any in Verona.

774
00:56:09,678 --> 00:56:11,669
By my head, here come the Capulets.

775
00:56:13,118 --> 00:56:15,757
By my heel... I care not.

776
00:56:17,678 --> 00:56:19,669
Follow me close.

777
00:56:33,358 --> 00:56:36,589
Gentlemen, good day.
A word with one of you?

778
00:56:37,838 --> 00:56:39,590
Ooh!

779
00:56:39,678 --> 00:56:41,669
And but one word with one of us?

780
00:56:41,758 --> 00:56:43,749
Couple it with something.

781
00:56:44,758 --> 00:56:46,350
Make it a word and a...

782
00:56:46,438 --> 00:56:47,268
...a blow!

783
00:56:47,358 --> 00:56:48,393
(laughter)

784
00:56:51,438 --> 00:56:53,474
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir...

785
00:56:53,558 --> 00:56:55,594
...and you will give me occasion.

786
00:56:55,678 --> 00:56:58,317
Could you not take some occasion
without giving?

787
00:56:58,398 --> 00:56:59,672
(laughter)

788
00:56:59,758 --> 00:57:00,952
Mercutio!

789
00:57:01,038 --> 00:57:03,871
Thou, uh... consortest with Romeo?

790
00:57:06,598 --> 00:57:08,111
Consort!

791
00:57:09,878 --> 00:57:11,914
What, dost thou make us minstrels?

792
00:57:11,998 --> 00:57:14,956
And thou make minstrels of us,
look to hear nothing but discords!

793
00:57:15,318 --> 00:57:16,910
Here's my fiddlestick!

794
00:57:16,998 --> 00:57:19,910
Here's that shall make you dance!
Zounds! Consort!

795
00:57:19,998 --> 00:57:23,593
Either withdraw unto some private place,
or reason coldly of your grievances...

796
00:57:23,678 --> 00:57:25,828
...or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us!

797
00:57:25,918 --> 00:57:27,829
Men's eyes were made to look,
and let them gaze.

798
00:57:27,918 --> 00:57:30,557
I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.

799
00:57:33,918 --> 00:57:36,751
Peace be with you, sir. Here comes my man.

800
00:57:38,358 --> 00:57:39,757
Mercutio!

801
00:57:42,238 --> 00:57:43,432
Romeo!

802
00:57:50,958 --> 00:57:54,109
The love I bear thee can afford
no better term than this.

803
00:57:54,918 --> 00:57:56,590
Thou art a villain!

804
00:57:58,758 --> 00:58:00,191
(snaps fingers)

805
00:58:38,798 --> 00:58:40,789
Tybalt...

806
00:58:42,358 --> 00:58:45,156
...the reason that I have to love thee...

807
00:58:45,598 --> 00:58:47,589
...doth much excuse...

808
00:58:47,678 --> 00:58:50,636
...the appertaining rage to such a greeting.

809
00:58:52,918 --> 00:58:55,113
Villain am I none.

810
00:58:58,238 --> 00:59:01,150
Therefore, farewell.

811
00:59:01,238 --> 00:59:03,115
I see thou knowest me not.

812
00:59:11,718 --> 00:59:14,835
Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
that thou hast done me!

813
00:59:15,518 --> 00:59:17,429
Turn and draw!

814
00:59:18,358 --> 00:59:19,347
Turn and draw!

815
00:59:20,718 --> 00:59:21,833
Turn and draw.

816
00:59:21,918 --> 00:59:25,433
- Turn and draw!
- I do protest I never injured thee...

817
00:59:26,678 --> 00:59:29,431
...but love thee better than thou canst devise...

818
00:59:29,518 --> 00:59:32,954
...till thou shalt know the reason of my love.

819
00:59:33,038 --> 00:59:35,268
And so, good Capulet...

820
00:59:35,358 --> 00:59:38,270
...whose name I tender
as dearly as mine own...

821
00:59:38,358 --> 00:59:40,349
(thunder)

822
00:59:42,518 --> 00:59:44,315
...be satisfied.

823
00:59:46,998 --> 00:59:48,989
Be satisfied.

824
00:59:49,998 --> 00:59:54,071
O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!

825
01:00:04,198 --> 01:00:06,189
Thou art my soul's hate!

826
01:00:14,678 --> 01:00:15,349
Tybalt!

827
01:00:16,198 --> 01:00:17,711
You rat-catcher!

828
01:00:17,798 --> 01:00:19,277
Will you walk?

829
01:00:19,998 --> 01:00:21,795
What wouldst thou have with me?

830
01:00:21,878 --> 01:00:24,631
Good King of Cats,
nothing but one of your nine lives!

831
01:00:24,718 --> 01:00:25,992
I am for you!

832
01:00:33,918 --> 01:00:35,033
(groans)

833
01:00:39,878 --> 01:00:42,950
Forbear this outrage, good Mercutio!

834
01:00:48,958 --> 01:00:50,232
(yells)

835
01:00:50,798 --> 01:00:51,708
(slash)

836
01:01:05,318 --> 01:01:06,637
(Mercutio chuckles)

837
01:01:06,718 --> 01:01:10,313
- Art thou hurt?
- Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch.

838
01:01:12,838 --> 01:01:14,715
A scratch!

839
01:01:15,958 --> 01:01:16,788
Ay, a scratch...

840
01:01:17,718 --> 01:01:19,151
A scratch! (laughs)

841
01:01:23,158 --> 01:01:26,150
Courage, man. The hurt cannot be much.

842
01:01:26,238 --> 01:01:27,956
'Twill serve.

843
01:01:28,038 --> 01:01:31,713
Ask for me tomorrow
and you shall find me a grave man.

844
01:01:47,878 --> 01:01:51,427
A plague... o' both your houses!

845
01:01:56,918 --> 01:01:59,432
They have made worms' meat of me.

846
01:01:59,518 --> 01:02:03,272
A plague on both your houses!

847
01:02:03,358 --> 01:02:04,791
(echoing) Your houses! Your houses!

848
01:02:04,878 --> 01:02:07,028
Your houses! Your houses!

849
01:02:18,678 --> 01:02:20,475
No!

850
01:02:42,358 --> 01:02:45,395
(Mercutio)
Why the devil came you between us?

851
01:02:45,478 --> 01:02:47,787
I was hurt under your arm.

852
01:02:47,878 --> 01:02:49,914
I thought all for the best!

853
01:02:51,318 --> 01:02:55,072
A plague o' both your houses.

854
01:02:57,318 --> 01:03:00,549
(sobs) No! No!

855
01:03:03,278 --> 01:03:05,314
(Abra) Come forth!

856
01:03:07,398 --> 01:03:08,956
Come forth!

857
01:03:09,038 --> 01:03:11,029
Mercutio!

858
01:03:14,518 --> 01:03:19,546
# Requiem aeternam

859
01:03:20,598 --> 01:03:25,752
# Requiem aeternam

860
01:03:27,438 --> 01:03:39,191
# Dona eis

861
01:03:43,238 --> 01:03:45,035
No!

862
01:04:22,518 --> 01:04:24,713
Come, gentle night.

863
01:04:25,318 --> 01:04:29,072
Come, loving, black-browed night.
Give me my Romeo.

864
01:04:29,318 --> 01:04:33,869
And when I shall die, take him
and cut him out in little stars...

865
01:04:33,958 --> 01:04:37,268
...and he will make
the face of heaven so fine...

866
01:04:37,358 --> 01:04:40,873
...that all the world
will be in love with night...

867
01:04:40,958 --> 01:04:43,677
...and pay no worship to the garish sun.

868
01:04:44,438 --> 01:04:47,748
O! I have bought the mansion of a love...

869
01:04:47,838 --> 01:04:50,033
...but not possessed it;

870
01:04:50,118 --> 01:04:52,757
...and though I am sold, not yet enjoyed.

871
01:04:53,278 --> 01:04:56,793
So... tedious is this day...

872
01:04:56,878 --> 01:05:00,314
...as is the night before some festival
to an impatient child...

873
01:05:00,398 --> 01:05:03,356
...that hath new robes and may not wear them.

874
01:05:04,758 --> 01:05:06,589
(yelling)

875
01:05:49,558 --> 01:05:52,914
Mercutio's soul is but a little way
above our heads...

876
01:05:52,998 --> 01:05:54,989
...staying for thine to keep him company!

877
01:05:55,078 --> 01:05:57,956
Thou wretched boy shalt with him hence!

878
01:05:58,718 --> 01:06:00,709
(sobbing) Either thou, or l...

879
01:06:00,798 --> 01:06:03,107
...or both, must go with him!

880
01:06:03,798 --> 01:06:07,154
Either thou, or l, or both, must go with him!

881
01:06:07,238 --> 01:06:08,671
Either thou...

882
01:06:08,758 --> 01:06:12,671
...or l, or both, must go with him!

883
01:06:16,998 --> 01:06:18,989
(yells)

884
01:06:31,038 --> 01:06:33,029
(thunder)

885
01:07:08,758 --> 01:07:13,149
I am fortune's fool!

886
01:07:22,198 --> 01:07:23,267
Romeo!

887
01:07:25,118 --> 01:07:27,393
Away, be gone! Stand not amazed!

888
01:07:33,598 --> 01:07:35,156
Away!

889
01:07:35,238 --> 01:07:37,229
Romeo!

890
01:07:44,038 --> 01:07:45,630
(sirens)

891
01:07:50,158 --> 01:07:52,149
Tybalt! (sobs)

892
01:07:57,118 --> 01:08:00,110
Where are the vile beginners of this fray?

893
01:08:03,198 --> 01:08:05,917
Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?

894
01:08:08,118 --> 01:08:11,474
Romeo he cries aloud, "Hold, friends!"

895
01:08:12,718 --> 01:08:15,437
Tybalt hit the life of stout Mercutio.

896
01:08:15,918 --> 01:08:17,909
Tybalt here slain...

897
01:08:18,798 --> 01:08:20,789
...Romeo's hand did slay.

898
01:08:20,878 --> 01:08:21,628
Prince!

899
01:08:22,998 --> 01:08:24,590
As thou art true...

900
01:08:24,678 --> 01:08:27,397
...for blood of ours, shed blood of Montague!

901
01:08:27,478 --> 01:08:30,117
Romeo... spoke him fair...

902
01:08:30,198 --> 01:08:32,758
...could not take truce
with the unruly spleen of Tybalt...

903
01:08:32,838 --> 01:08:34,157
...deaf to peace.

904
01:08:34,238 --> 01:08:36,752
He is a kinsman to the Montague.
Affection makes him false!

905
01:08:37,838 --> 01:08:40,716
I beg forjustice,
which thou, Prince, must give!

906
01:08:41,718 --> 01:08:43,470
Romeo slew Tybalt.

907
01:08:43,558 --> 01:08:45,150
Romeo must not live!

908
01:08:47,398 --> 01:08:49,992
Romeo slew him. He slew Mercutio.

909
01:08:50,078 --> 01:08:52,831
Who now the price of his dear blood
doth owe?

910
01:08:52,918 --> 01:08:54,909
(wailing)

911
01:08:56,518 --> 01:08:59,237
Not Romeo, Prince.
He was Mercutio's friend.

912
01:08:59,318 --> 01:09:02,355
His fault concludes but what the law
should end-the life of Tybalt.

913
01:09:02,438 --> 01:09:04,872
And for that offence
immediately we do exile him.

914
01:09:04,958 --> 01:09:05,947
Noble Prince...

915
01:09:06,038 --> 01:09:08,188
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses!

916
01:09:08,278 --> 01:09:10,951
Nor tears nor prayers
shall purchase out abuses!

917
01:09:11,038 --> 01:09:12,596
Therefore use none!

918
01:09:15,958 --> 01:09:18,916
Let Romeo hence in haste!

919
01:09:18,998 --> 01:09:24,868
Else, when he is found, that hour is his last!

920
01:09:24,958 --> 01:09:27,995
Romeo is banished!

921
01:09:29,238 --> 01:09:31,229
Banishment...

922
01:09:32,838 --> 01:09:34,829
Be merciful, say death.

923
01:09:35,358 --> 01:09:39,271
For exile hath more terror in his look,
much more than death.

924
01:09:39,918 --> 01:09:42,113
Do not say banishment.

925
01:09:42,598 --> 01:09:47,752
Affliction is enamoured of thy parts,
and thou art wedded to calamity.

926
01:09:47,838 --> 01:09:50,147
Hence from Verona art thou banished.

927
01:09:50,238 --> 01:09:53,548
Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.

928
01:09:53,638 --> 01:09:55,788
There is no world without Verona walls.

929
01:09:55,878 --> 01:10:00,110
Hence banished is banish'd from
the world, and world's exile is death.

930
01:10:00,198 --> 01:10:01,870
Then banished is death mistermed.

931
01:10:01,958 --> 01:10:04,950
Calling death banished, thou cutt'st
my head off with a golden axe...

932
01:10:05,038 --> 01:10:07,029
...and smil'st upon the stroke
that murders me.

933
01:10:07,118 --> 01:10:10,076
O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!

934
01:10:10,158 --> 01:10:12,911
This is dear mercy and thou seest it not.

935
01:10:12,998 --> 01:10:13,987
(knocking)

936
01:10:14,958 --> 01:10:16,357
Hence!

937
01:10:18,838 --> 01:10:20,635
(knocking)

938
01:10:21,478 --> 01:10:22,467
(knocking)

939
01:10:23,518 --> 01:10:25,986
- I come from my lady Juliet!
- Welcome, then.

940
01:10:26,078 --> 01:10:27,557
Where is my lady's lord?

941
01:10:27,638 --> 01:10:29,629
Romeo, come forth.

942
01:10:30,558 --> 01:10:32,549
- Ah, sir.
- Nurse.

943
01:10:33,118 --> 01:10:34,915
Ah, sir.

944
01:10:34,998 --> 01:10:36,989
Death's the end of all.

945
01:10:38,118 --> 01:10:40,109
Speakest thou of Juliet?

946
01:10:40,558 --> 01:10:42,594
Where is she and how doth she?

947
01:10:42,678 --> 01:10:45,715
And what says my concealed lady
to our cancelled love?

948
01:10:45,798 --> 01:10:49,074
O she says nothing, sir,
but weeps and weeps.

949
01:10:49,158 --> 01:10:52,753
And then on Romeo cries,
and then falls down again.

950
01:10:55,278 --> 01:10:58,793
As if that name, shot from
the deadly level of a gun...

951
01:10:58,878 --> 01:11:04,077
...did murder her, as that name's
cursed hand murdered her kinsman!

952
01:11:04,518 --> 01:11:06,907
I thought thy disposition better tempered.

953
01:11:06,998 --> 01:11:09,796
Thy Juliet is alive. There art thou happy.

954
01:11:10,478 --> 01:11:13,356
Tybalt would kill thee,
but thou slewest Tybalt.

955
01:11:13,438 --> 01:11:15,429
There art thou happy.

956
01:11:15,958 --> 01:11:20,668
The law that threatened death
becomes thy friend and turns it to exile.

957
01:11:20,758 --> 01:11:22,714
There art thou happy.

958
01:11:22,798 --> 01:11:25,392
A pack of blessings light upon thy back.

959
01:11:25,478 --> 01:11:28,993
Wherefore railest thou on thy birth,
the heaven, and earth...

960
01:11:29,078 --> 01:11:33,071
...since birth, and heaven, and earth,
all three do meet in thee at once?

961
01:11:33,158 --> 01:11:35,069
Sir, a ring my lady bid me give you.

962
01:11:37,118 --> 01:11:39,427
How well my comfort is revived by this.

963
01:11:39,878 --> 01:11:40,867
Go.

964
01:11:41,878 --> 01:11:44,187
Get thee to thy love, as was decreed.

965
01:11:44,278 --> 01:11:47,350
Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her.

966
01:11:48,238 --> 01:11:50,035
Hie you! Make haste!

967
01:11:50,998 --> 01:11:53,432
But look thou...
stay not till the watch be set...

968
01:11:53,518 --> 01:11:55,634
...for then thou canst not pass to Mantua...

969
01:11:55,718 --> 01:11:59,427
...where thou wilt live till we can
find a time to blaze your marriage...

970
01:11:59,518 --> 01:12:02,316
...reconcile your friends,
beg pardon of the Prince...

971
01:12:02,398 --> 01:12:06,027
...and call thee back with
twenty hundred thousand times more joy...

972
01:12:06,118 --> 01:12:08,507
...than thou went'st forth in lamentation.

973
01:12:11,838 --> 01:12:14,671
Quick, hence! Be gone by break of day!

974
01:12:15,118 --> 01:12:16,756
Sojourn in Mantua!

975
01:12:17,158 --> 01:12:18,637
Farewell.

976
01:12:18,718 --> 01:12:20,549
(thunder)

977
01:12:25,798 --> 01:12:27,356
O God!

978
01:12:27,438 --> 01:12:30,157
Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?

979
01:12:30,758 --> 01:12:34,592
O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!

980
01:12:36,038 --> 01:12:40,236
Was ever book containing
such vile matter so fairly bound?

981
01:12:40,718 --> 01:12:44,552
O that deceit should dwell
in such a gorgeous palace!

982
01:12:48,758 --> 01:12:50,874
She'll not come down tonight.

983
01:12:52,638 --> 01:12:55,357
These times of woe afford no time to woo.

984
01:12:55,438 --> 01:12:58,874
Look you, she loved
her kinsman Tybalt dearly.

985
01:12:58,958 --> 01:13:00,949
And so did I.

986
01:13:01,038 --> 01:13:02,630
Well...

987
01:13:03,718 --> 01:13:05,709
...we were born to die.

988
01:13:06,118 --> 01:13:10,908
I'll know her mind early tomorrow.
Tonight she's mewed up to her heaviness.

989
01:13:20,198 --> 01:13:23,156
Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?

990
01:13:23,238 --> 01:13:26,708
Ah, poor my lord, what tongue
shall smooth thy name...

991
01:13:26,798 --> 01:13:30,427
...when l, thy three-hours' wife,
have mangled it?

992
01:13:30,518 --> 01:13:33,988
But whyfore, villain,
didst thou kill my cousin?

993
01:13:35,198 --> 01:13:35,994
(gasps)

994
01:13:56,158 --> 01:14:05,271
# I'm kissing you

995
01:14:36,558 --> 01:14:49,551
# Coœ I'm kissing you, o-oh

996
01:14:51,198 --> 01:15:04,077
# I'm kissing you

997
01:15:10,198 --> 01:15:13,156
I will make a desperate tender
of my child's love.

998
01:15:13,238 --> 01:15:16,355
I think she will be ruled in all respects by me.

999
01:15:16,438 --> 01:15:20,067
Nay, more! I doubt it not!

1000
01:15:20,158 --> 01:15:22,228
But what say you to Thursday?

1001
01:15:22,318 --> 01:15:24,309
My lord, I...

1002
01:15:24,958 --> 01:15:27,392
I would that Thursday were tomorrow!

1003
01:15:27,478 --> 01:15:30,117
Thursday let it be, then! Wife!

1004
01:15:30,198 --> 01:15:32,189
Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed.

1005
01:15:32,278 --> 01:15:35,907
Tell her o' Thursday she shall
be married to this noble sir!

1006
01:16:47,238 --> 01:16:50,036
Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.

1007
01:16:50,958 --> 01:16:53,677
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.

1008
01:16:54,198 --> 01:16:56,917
Yon light is not daylight; I know it, I.

1009
01:16:56,998 --> 01:17:02,026
It is some meteor that the sun exhales
to light thee on thy way to Mantua.

1010
01:17:02,118 --> 01:17:05,349
Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not be gone.

1011
01:17:05,718 --> 01:17:07,709
Well, let me be taken.

1012
01:17:07,798 --> 01:17:09,516
Let me be put to death!

1013
01:17:09,878 --> 01:17:12,267
I have more care to stay than will to go.

1014
01:17:12,358 --> 01:17:15,395
Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.

1015
01:17:17,638 --> 01:17:20,914
How is't, my soul? Let's talk. It is not day.

1016
01:17:24,038 --> 01:17:26,233
It is... It is!

1017
01:17:26,838 --> 01:17:29,227
Hie hence, be gone, away!

1018
01:17:29,798 --> 01:17:31,868
O now be gone!
More light and light it grows.

1019
01:17:32,718 --> 01:17:34,709
More light and light...

1020
01:17:34,798 --> 01:17:36,914
...more dark and dark our woes.

1021
01:17:38,318 --> 01:17:39,717
- (door opens)
- Madam!

1022
01:17:43,118 --> 01:17:45,348
Your lady mother is coming to your chamber!

1023
01:17:45,438 --> 01:17:47,713
(Gloria) Ho, daughter, are you up?

1024
01:17:53,558 --> 01:17:54,911
Then, window...

1025
01:17:54,998 --> 01:17:56,989
...let day in and let life...

1026
01:17:57,758 --> 01:17:58,747
...out!

1027
01:17:58,838 --> 01:17:59,953
Juliet?

1028
01:18:00,038 --> 01:18:03,189
- Think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
- I doubt it not.

1029
01:18:06,478 --> 01:18:10,471
Trust me, love. All these woes
shall serve for sweet discourses...

1030
01:18:10,558 --> 01:18:12,867
...in our times to come.
- Ho, daughter!

1031
01:18:16,798 --> 01:18:17,787
Juliet!

1032
01:18:28,438 --> 01:18:30,110
O God!

1033
01:18:30,198 --> 01:18:32,393
I have an ill-divining soul!

1034
01:18:32,478 --> 01:18:34,867
Methinks I see thee, now thou art so low...

1035
01:18:34,958 --> 01:18:36,914
...as one dead in the bottom of a tomb.

1036
01:18:38,838 --> 01:18:41,306
Adieu!

1037
01:18:41,838 --> 01:18:43,510
O fortune, fortune!

1038
01:18:43,598 --> 01:18:45,395
Be fickle, fortune.

1039
01:18:45,478 --> 01:18:49,357
For then I hope thou wilt not
keep him long, but send him back.

1040
01:18:59,758 --> 01:19:01,874
Thou hast a careful father, child.

1041
01:19:01,958 --> 01:19:05,030
One who, to put thee from thy heaviness...

1042
01:19:05,118 --> 01:19:08,190
...hath sorted out a sudden day ofjoy...

1043
01:19:08,758 --> 01:19:12,273
...which thou expect'st not,
nor I looked not for.

1044
01:19:13,238 --> 01:19:15,547
Madam, in happy time. What day is that?

1045
01:19:15,638 --> 01:19:18,675
Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn...

1046
01:19:18,758 --> 01:19:21,795
...the gallant, young,
and noble gentleman, Sir Paris...

1047
01:19:21,878 --> 01:19:25,109
...at St Peter's Church,
shall happily make thee there...

1048
01:19:25,198 --> 01:19:26,392
...ajoyful bride.

1049
01:19:31,638 --> 01:19:34,516
Now, by St Peter's Church and Peter too...

1050
01:19:34,598 --> 01:19:37,510
...he shall not make me there ajoyful bride!

1051
01:19:38,558 --> 01:19:40,913
Here comes your father. Tell him so yourself.

1052
01:19:40,998 --> 01:19:42,875
How now, wife?

1053
01:19:42,958 --> 01:19:45,392
Have you delivered to her our decree?

1054
01:19:45,478 --> 01:19:46,797
Ay, sir.

1055
01:19:46,878 --> 01:19:49,187
But she will none, she gives you thanks.

1056
01:19:50,158 --> 01:19:53,150
I would the fool were married to her grave.

1057
01:19:56,438 --> 01:19:57,837
How?

1058
01:19:57,918 --> 01:19:59,909
Will she none?

1059
01:19:59,998 --> 01:20:01,989
Is she not proud?

1060
01:20:02,358 --> 01:20:05,668
Doth she not count her blest,
unworthy as she is...

1061
01:20:05,758 --> 01:20:08,989
...that we have wrought so worthy
a gentleman to be her bride?

1062
01:20:09,478 --> 01:20:12,675
Not proud you have,
but thankful that you have.

1063
01:20:12,758 --> 01:20:15,511
Proud can I never be of what I hate!

1064
01:20:15,598 --> 01:20:18,476
Thank me no thankings,
nor proud me no prouds!

1065
01:20:18,558 --> 01:20:21,834
But fettle your fine joints
'gainst Thursday next!

1066
01:20:21,918 --> 01:20:23,874
Hear me with patience but to speak a word!

1067
01:20:23,958 --> 01:20:24,868
No!

1068
01:20:24,958 --> 01:20:25,947
Fie, fie! Stop it!

1069
01:20:26,038 --> 01:20:28,677
Speak not! Reply not! Do not answer me!

1070
01:20:28,758 --> 01:20:30,396
Husband, are you mad?

1071
01:20:32,798 --> 01:20:35,995
Hang thee, young baggage!
Disobedient wretch!

1072
01:20:36,078 --> 01:20:39,115
God in heaven bless her! You are
to blame, my lord, to rate her so!

1073
01:20:39,198 --> 01:20:41,075
Peace, you mumbling fool!

1074
01:20:41,158 --> 01:20:42,910
I tell thee what.

1075
01:20:42,998 --> 01:20:45,193
Get thee to church o' Thursday...

1076
01:20:45,278 --> 01:20:47,587
...or never after look me in the face!

1077
01:20:47,678 --> 01:20:50,351
An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend.

1078
01:20:50,438 --> 01:20:53,396
An you be not, hang, beg, starve...

1079
01:20:53,478 --> 01:20:55,389
...die in the streets!

1080
01:20:55,478 --> 01:20:57,150
Trust to 't. Bethink you.

1081
01:20:57,238 --> 01:20:59,229
I'll not be forsworn!

1082
01:21:10,318 --> 01:21:14,596
O sweet my mother, cast me not away!

1083
01:21:15,798 --> 01:21:18,631
Delay this marriage for a month, a week.

1084
01:21:18,718 --> 01:21:20,276
Or, if you do not...

1085
01:21:20,358 --> 01:21:23,589
...make the bridal bed in that
dim monument where Tybalt lies.

1086
01:21:25,598 --> 01:21:27,350
Talk not to me...

1087
01:21:29,318 --> 01:21:31,309
...for I'll not speak a word.

1088
01:21:32,118 --> 01:21:34,996
Do as thou wilt,
for I have done with thee.

1089
01:21:45,758 --> 01:21:47,350
O God!

1090
01:21:47,438 --> 01:21:50,077
O Nurse, how shall this be prevented?

1091
01:21:51,918 --> 01:21:56,230
What say'st thou? Hast thou not
a word ofjoy? Some comfort, Nurse!

1092
01:21:57,078 --> 01:21:59,069
Faith, here it is.

1093
01:22:00,158 --> 01:22:03,912
I think it best you marry with this Paris.

1094
01:22:05,278 --> 01:22:07,269
O he's a lovely gentleman.

1095
01:22:10,798 --> 01:22:14,029
I think you are happy in this second match...

1096
01:22:14,918 --> 01:22:16,909
...for it excels your first.

1097
01:22:17,958 --> 01:22:19,949
Or, if it did not...

1098
01:22:20,038 --> 01:22:22,233
...your first is dead.

1099
01:22:27,198 --> 01:22:29,189
Or 'twere as good he were...

1100
01:22:29,278 --> 01:22:31,997
...as living here and you no use to him.

1101
01:22:35,638 --> 01:22:37,754
Speakest thou from thy heart?

1102
01:22:39,038 --> 01:22:42,394
And from my soul too;
else beshrew them both!

1103
01:22:44,358 --> 01:22:45,950
Amen.

1104
01:22:46,038 --> 01:22:47,630
What?

1105
01:22:50,718 --> 01:22:53,630
Well, thou hast comforted me
marvellous much.

1106
01:22:54,758 --> 01:22:59,274
Go in and tell my lady I am gone,
having displeased my father...

1107
01:22:59,358 --> 01:23:03,351
...to Friar Laurence to make
confession and be absolved.

1108
01:23:08,558 --> 01:23:11,630
Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death.

1109
01:23:11,718 --> 01:23:14,391
Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous...

1110
01:23:14,478 --> 01:23:17,276
...that she doth give her sorrow
so much sway...

1111
01:23:17,358 --> 01:23:22,512
...and in his wisdom hastes our marriage
to stop the inundation of her tears.

1112
01:23:22,598 --> 01:23:23,917
(door opens)

1113
01:23:25,558 --> 01:23:28,436
Happily met, my lady and my wife.

1114
01:23:29,118 --> 01:23:31,348
That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.

1115
01:23:31,438 --> 01:23:34,111
That "may be" must be, love,
on Thursday next.

1116
01:23:34,198 --> 01:23:37,986
- What must be shall be.
- Well, that's a certain text.

1117
01:23:38,998 --> 01:23:41,034
Come you to make confession?

1118
01:23:41,118 --> 01:23:45,191
Are you at leisure, holy Father, now,
or shall I come to you at evening mass?

1119
01:23:45,278 --> 01:23:48,668
My leisure serves thee,
pensive daughter, now.

1120
01:23:48,758 --> 01:23:51,636
Good sir, we must entreat the time alone.

1121
01:23:52,118 --> 01:23:54,837
God shield I should disturb devotion!

1122
01:23:58,478 --> 01:24:02,517
Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye.

1123
01:24:03,558 --> 01:24:05,514
Till then adieu...

1124
01:24:05,598 --> 01:24:07,589
...and keep this holy kiss.

1125
01:24:15,838 --> 01:24:17,794
Tell me not, Father,
that thou hearest of this...

1126
01:24:17,878 --> 01:24:21,587
...unless thou tell me how I may prevent it!
- It strains me past the compass of my wits!

1127
01:24:21,678 --> 01:24:23,589
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help...

1128
01:24:23,678 --> 01:24:25,430
...do thou but call my resolution wise.

1129
01:24:25,518 --> 01:24:28,157
- And with this, I'll help it presently!
- Hold, daughter!

1130
01:24:28,238 --> 01:24:31,435
Be not so long to speak! I long to die!

1131
01:24:32,558 --> 01:24:35,118
I do spy a kind of hope...

1132
01:24:35,198 --> 01:24:37,314
...which craves as desperate an execution...

1133
01:24:37,398 --> 01:24:39,593
...as that is desperate
which we would prevent.

1134
01:24:39,678 --> 01:24:41,873
lf, rather than to marry with this Paris...

1135
01:24:41,958 --> 01:24:44,597
...thou hast the strength of will
to slay thyself...

1136
01:24:44,678 --> 01:24:48,353
...then it is likely thou wilt
undertake a thing like death...

1137
01:24:48,438 --> 01:24:51,236
...to chide away this shame.

1138
01:24:52,038 --> 01:24:54,029
And, if thou darest...

1139
01:24:54,958 --> 01:24:56,949
...l'll give thee remedy.

1140
01:24:58,558 --> 01:25:02,267
No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest.

1141
01:25:02,358 --> 01:25:04,918
Each part,
deprived of supple government...

1142
01:25:04,998 --> 01:25:07,990
...shall stiff and stark and cold
appear, like death.

1143
01:25:08,358 --> 01:25:12,556
Now, when the bridegroom in the morning
comes to rouse thee from thy bed...

1144
01:25:12,638 --> 01:25:14,629
...there art thou dead.

1145
01:25:14,718 --> 01:25:16,674
Thou shalt be borne
to that same ancient vault...

1146
01:25:16,758 --> 01:25:18,555
...where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.

1147
01:25:18,638 --> 01:25:21,232
And in this borrowed likeness
of shrunk death...

1148
01:25:21,318 --> 01:25:23,786
...thou shalt continue
four and twenty hours...

1149
01:25:23,878 --> 01:25:26,392
...and then awake as from a pleasant sleep.

1150
01:25:26,478 --> 01:25:29,072
In the meantime, against thou shalt awake...

1151
01:25:29,158 --> 01:25:31,592
...shall Romeo by my letters know our drift.

1152
01:25:31,678 --> 01:25:36,468
And hither shall he come that very night
to bear thee both hence to Mantua.

1153
01:25:37,038 --> 01:25:39,347
Take thou this vial, being then in bed...

1154
01:25:39,438 --> 01:25:41,952
...and this distilling liquor drink thou off.

1155
01:25:42,038 --> 01:25:46,270
I'll send my letters to thy lord
post haste to Mantua.

1156
01:25:56,918 --> 01:25:58,192
(knocking)

1157
01:25:58,278 --> 01:25:59,597
Hello?

1158
01:26:21,758 --> 01:26:24,067
What if this mixture do not work at all?

1159
01:26:24,158 --> 01:26:27,150
Shall I be married then tomorrow morning?

1160
01:26:29,518 --> 01:26:30,507
(door opens)

1161
01:26:30,598 --> 01:26:33,670
- What, are you busy? Need you my help?
- No, madam.

1162
01:26:33,758 --> 01:26:37,114
We have culled such necessaries
as are behoveful for our estate tomorrow.

1163
01:26:37,198 --> 01:26:40,827
So please you, let me now be left alone,
and let the nurse this night sit up with you.

1164
01:26:40,918 --> 01:26:43,034
For I am sure you have your hands full all...

1165
01:26:43,118 --> 01:26:44,756
...in this so sudden business.

1166
01:26:44,838 --> 01:26:46,317
Good night.

1167
01:26:46,398 --> 01:26:48,389
Get thee to bed and rest...

1168
01:26:49,358 --> 01:26:51,508
...for thou hast need.

1169
01:26:57,718 --> 01:26:59,071
Farewell.

1170
01:27:02,038 --> 01:27:04,506
God knows when we shall meet again.

1171
01:27:07,038 --> 01:27:08,357
Good night.

1172
01:27:21,358 --> 01:27:23,349
Romeo...

1173
01:27:23,438 --> 01:27:25,508
...I drink to thee.

1174
01:27:42,278 --> 01:27:49,514
# Requiem...

1175
01:27:54,878 --> 01:27:58,712
As the custom is, in all her best array,
bear her to church.

1176
01:28:24,678 --> 01:28:26,669
(bell tolls)

1177
01:28:53,678 --> 01:28:56,556
And all this day an unaccustomed spirit...

1178
01:28:56,638 --> 01:29:00,313
...lifts me above the ground
with cheerful thoughts.

1179
01:29:00,398 --> 01:29:02,832
I dreamt my lady came
and found me dead...

1180
01:29:02,918 --> 01:29:06,706
...and breathed such life with kisses
in my lips that I revived...

1181
01:29:06,798 --> 01:29:08,789
...and was an emperor.

1182
01:29:09,838 --> 01:29:11,829
Ah me!

1183
01:29:11,918 --> 01:29:14,386
How sweet is love itself possessed...

1184
01:29:14,478 --> 01:29:17,629
...when but love's shadows
are so rich in joy!

1185
01:29:34,638 --> 01:29:36,230
News from Verona!

1186
01:29:44,478 --> 01:29:45,672
How now, Balthasar?

1187
01:29:45,758 --> 01:29:48,591
Dost thou not bring me
letters from the priest?

1188
01:29:48,678 --> 01:29:51,146
How doth my lady? Is my father well?

1189
01:29:52,318 --> 01:29:55,913
How doth my lady Juliet?
For nothing can be ill if she be well.

1190
01:29:58,678 --> 01:30:01,272
Then she is well, and nothing can be ill.

1191
01:30:08,798 --> 01:30:10,789
Her body rests in chapel monument...

1192
01:30:10,878 --> 01:30:13,995
...and her immortal part
with the angels lives.

1193
01:30:14,718 --> 01:30:16,709
I saw her laid low.

1194
01:30:17,678 --> 01:30:20,192
Pardon me for bringing these ill news.

1195
01:30:25,958 --> 01:30:27,949
Is it e'en so?

1196
01:30:50,758 --> 01:30:53,352
Then I defy you, stars!

1197
01:31:06,118 --> 01:31:07,710
Juliet!

1198
01:31:09,118 --> 01:31:11,188
Juliet!

1199
01:31:43,718 --> 01:31:47,108
- I will hence tonight.
- Have patience!

1200
01:31:50,958 --> 01:31:52,437
Leave me!

1201
01:31:52,518 --> 01:31:55,316
Your looks are pale and wild
and do import some misadventure.

1202
01:31:55,398 --> 01:31:57,195
Tush! Thou art deceived!

1203
01:31:58,198 --> 01:32:01,190
Hast thou no letters to me from the priest?

1204
01:32:12,278 --> 01:32:14,269
No matter.

1205
01:32:18,118 --> 01:32:20,109
Well, Juliet...

1206
01:32:21,518 --> 01:32:23,713
...I will lie with thee tonight.

1207
01:32:27,758 --> 01:32:29,749
I will hence tonight.

1208
01:33:06,398 --> 01:33:09,834
(police radio)
Romeo is within Verona walls.

1209
01:33:18,558 --> 01:33:19,957
Fear comes upon me!

1210
01:33:20,438 --> 01:33:22,394
O, much I fear...

1211
01:33:22,478 --> 01:33:25,914
...some ill, unthrifty thing!

1212
01:33:28,438 --> 01:33:30,110
The letter was of dear import!

1213
01:33:31,238 --> 01:33:33,627
I couldn't send it,
nor get a messenger to bring it thee.

1214
01:33:34,878 --> 01:33:36,755
The neglecting it may do much damage.

1215
01:33:36,838 --> 01:33:39,193
Bring forth these enemies,
Capulet and Montague!

1216
01:33:49,318 --> 01:33:50,876
(knocking)

1217
01:33:51,998 --> 01:33:53,397
Let me have a dram of poison...

1218
01:33:53,478 --> 01:33:57,630
...such soon-speeding gear as will
disperse itself through all the veins...

1219
01:33:57,718 --> 01:33:59,754
...that the life-weary taker may fall dead.

1220
01:33:59,838 --> 01:34:03,990
Such mortal drugs I have, but Verona law
is death to any he that utters them.

1221
01:34:04,078 --> 01:34:07,070
The world is not thy friend,
nor the world's law!

1222
01:34:07,158 --> 01:34:09,114
Then be not poor, but break it...

1223
01:34:09,198 --> 01:34:10,995
...and take this!

1224
01:34:12,638 --> 01:34:15,198
My poverty but not my will consents.

1225
01:34:15,798 --> 01:34:18,710
I pay thy poverty and not thy will.

1226
01:34:29,518 --> 01:34:31,748
Drink it off...

1227
01:34:31,838 --> 01:34:35,672
...and if you had the strength of 20 men,
it would dispatch you straight.

1228
01:34:35,758 --> 01:34:37,350
There's my gold.

1229
01:34:37,438 --> 01:34:39,235
(helicopter)

1230
01:34:40,398 --> 01:34:42,389
Worse poison to men's souls...

1231
01:34:42,478 --> 01:34:46,027
...than these poor compounds
that thou may'st not sell.

1232
01:35:08,878 --> 01:35:11,756
Romeo hath no notice of these accidents.

1233
01:35:12,398 --> 01:35:14,434
I will write again to Mantua.

1234
01:35:19,638 --> 01:35:22,277
Within the hour will the fair Juliet wake.

1235
01:35:22,358 --> 01:35:24,349
She stirs. The lady stirs.

1236
01:35:32,998 --> 01:35:36,468
- I do beseech you.
- Live and be prosperous.

1237
01:35:37,438 --> 01:35:39,429
And farewell, good fellow.

1238
01:35:40,078 --> 01:35:41,557
Then I will leave thee.

1239
01:35:52,918 --> 01:35:53,953
(sirens)

1240
01:36:18,598 --> 01:36:20,395
Tempt not a desperate man!

1241
01:36:27,398 --> 01:36:28,831
Hold! Hold!

1242
01:36:29,878 --> 01:36:30,913
(gunshots)

1243
01:36:31,078 --> 01:36:32,067
Hold!

1244
01:36:38,198 --> 01:36:40,473
(Prince) Once more I say to you, hold!

1245
01:36:47,678 --> 01:36:49,669
(panting)

1246
01:39:39,038 --> 01:39:41,029
My love...

1247
01:39:42,078 --> 01:39:44,069
My wife...

1248
01:39:44,678 --> 01:39:47,431
Death that hath sucked
the honey of thy breath...

1249
01:39:47,518 --> 01:39:50,191
...hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.

1250
01:39:52,878 --> 01:39:54,869
Thou art not conquered.

1251
01:39:58,958 --> 01:40:03,793
Beauty's ensign yet is crimson
in thy lips and in thy cheeks...

1252
01:40:04,358 --> 01:40:07,589
...and death's pale flag is not advanced there.

1253
01:40:19,518 --> 01:40:23,591
Dear Juliet, why art thou yet so fair?

1254
01:40:26,118 --> 01:40:29,793
Shall I believe that
unsubstantial death is amorous...

1255
01:40:29,878 --> 01:40:33,075
...and keeps thee here in dark
to be his paramour?

1256
01:41:10,398 --> 01:41:11,751
Here.

1257
01:41:11,838 --> 01:41:14,910
O, here will I set up my everlasting rest...

1258
01:41:16,718 --> 01:41:22,190
...and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
from this world-wearied flesh.

1259
01:41:29,678 --> 01:41:31,669
Eyes, look your last.

1260
01:41:34,358 --> 01:41:36,474
Arms, take your last embrace.

1261
01:41:44,118 --> 01:41:45,710
And lips...

1262
01:41:46,798 --> 01:41:48,914
O you, the doors to breath...

1263
01:41:52,598 --> 01:41:54,828
...seal with a righteous kiss...

1264
01:42:16,078 --> 01:42:18,069
...a dateless bargain...

1265
01:42:18,598 --> 01:42:20,554
...to engrossing death.

1266
01:42:25,398 --> 01:42:26,751
Romeo...

1267
01:42:27,918 --> 01:42:29,715
(gasping)

1268
01:42:38,358 --> 01:42:39,916
What's here?

1269
01:42:43,438 --> 01:42:44,587
Poison...

1270
01:42:46,318 --> 01:42:49,594
Drunk all, and left no friendly drop
to help me after?

1271
01:42:54,398 --> 01:42:56,389
I'll kiss thy lips.

1272
01:42:56,478 --> 01:42:59,072
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them.

1273
01:43:03,878 --> 01:43:05,869
Thy lips are warm.

1274
01:43:21,118 --> 01:43:22,710
Thus...

1275
01:43:23,878 --> 01:43:25,869
...with a kiss...

1276
01:43:29,758 --> 01:43:31,749
...I die.

1277
01:45:39,158 --> 01:45:40,352
(gunshot)

1278
01:45:47,758 --> 01:45:50,830
(# "Tristan and Isolde" by Wagner)

1279
01:47:24,518 --> 01:47:27,669
See what a scourge
is laid upon your hate...

1280
01:47:27,758 --> 01:47:31,273
...that heaven finds means
to kill yourjoys with love!

1281
01:47:32,078 --> 01:47:36,549
And l, for winking at your discords too,
have lost a brace of kinsmen.

1282
01:47:40,438 --> 01:47:42,429
All are punished.

1283
01:47:49,558 --> 01:47:53,187
All are punished!

1284
01:47:56,758 --> 01:48:00,387
(TV) A glooming peace
this morning with it brings.

1285
01:48:00,478 --> 01:48:03,436
The sun for sorrow
will not show his head.

1286
01:48:03,518 --> 01:48:06,828
Go hence, to have more talk
of these sad things.

1287
01:48:07,558 --> 01:48:10,755
Some shall be pardoned,
and some punished.

1288
01:48:11,358 --> 01:48:18,036
For never was a story of more woe
than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
