5
00:00:17,867 --> 00:00:20,300
I thought we talked about
flossing at your last visit.

6
00:00:20,433 --> 00:00:21,900
I floss.

7
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:24,700
I don't think so.

8
00:00:24,834 --> 00:00:26,000
One of these
might have to come out.

9
00:00:26,133 --> 00:00:29,033
Denise, would you mind calling
Dr. Belling in here, please?

10
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:30,734
Yes, Dr. Hall.
Right away.

11
00:00:30,867 --> 00:00:33,066
Oh, I hear you and Dr. Belling
are getting married.

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,633
Two months from today.

13
00:00:36,266 --> 00:00:37,200
How did you two meet?

14
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:39,633
Um, we were childhood friends.

15
00:00:39,767 --> 00:00:40,600
We fell out of touch
after high school,

16
00:00:40,734 --> 00:00:41,700
but then,

17
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:43,467
my first day of dental school,

18
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,600
I walked into
my Oral Pathology class,

19
00:00:45,734 --> 00:00:47,433
and sure enough, there he was.

20
00:00:47,567 --> 00:00:48,467
Some things

21
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,533
are just meant to be.

22
00:00:49,667 --> 00:00:50,967
So where are you two going
on your honeymoon?

23
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:52,967
Honeymoon?

24
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,233
Uh...

25
00:00:55,367 --> 00:00:57,400
we haven't actually
talked about it.

26
00:00:57,533 --> 00:00:58,367
I think we've just been so busy

27
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,800
that we haven't had time
to plan anything.

28
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:00,967
My wife and I

29
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,333
just took a six-week tour
through South America.

30
00:01:03,467 --> 00:01:04,700
Hiking in the Andes,

31
00:01:04,834 --> 00:01:06,367
Machu Picchu,

32
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,367
and we went ziplined
over the Inca Trail.

33
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,500
I highly recommend it.

34
00:01:11,633 --> 00:01:12,834
Sounds fun.

35
00:01:14,133 --> 00:01:15,033
Although, I'm not sure

36
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:16,700
that's something
Dr. Belling and I would do.

37
00:01:16,834 --> 00:01:18,700
George doesn't really like
roughing it outdoors.

38
00:01:18,834 --> 00:01:19,767
Oh...

39
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:20,667
It's just something

40
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,567
you have to try
once in your life.

41
00:01:23,233 --> 00:01:23,967
It's like I told my wife,

42
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:27,000
you don't regret
the things you do,

43
00:01:27,133 --> 00:01:28,834
you regret
the things you don't do.

44
00:01:30,233 --> 00:01:31,233
Like flossing.

45
00:01:33,567 --> 00:01:34,967
Denise!

46
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:35,934
Thanks again
for your work today

47
00:01:36,066 --> 00:01:37,133
with Mrs. Gibson's crown.

48
00:01:37,266 --> 00:01:38,800
It was outstanding.

49
00:01:38,934 --> 00:01:40,667
Oh, thank you, Dr. Belling.

50
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,967
That was a lot of fun.

51
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,834
It was, wasn't it?

52
00:01:43,967 --> 00:01:46,000
Well, have a great time
on your vacation.

53
00:01:46,133 --> 00:01:47,033
Oh, it won't be vacation.

54
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:48,667
No? I thought
you were going to the island

55
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,000
to visit Dr. Belling's family?

56
00:01:50,133 --> 00:01:51,266
We are.

57
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,367
But we are way too busy

58
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,667
to think about having anything

59
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,367
that even remotely resembles
a vacation while we are there.

60
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,600
Our engagement party
is in a week,

61
00:01:58,734 --> 00:01:59,533
and we still have

62
00:01:59,667 --> 00:02:00,734
a lot of wedding planning
left to do.

63
00:02:00,867 --> 00:02:01,800
I'm sure it will go smoothly.

64
00:02:01,934 --> 00:02:03,667
You have been working on
that wedding itinerary

65
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,166
for months, Dr. Hall.

66
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,233
Thank you, Denise.

67
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,400
Oh, George,
I almost forgot to tell you.

68
00:02:11,533 --> 00:02:13,767
I changed something
on the itinerary.

69
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,600
I had to move our meeting
with the florist to 10:15,

70
00:02:15,734 --> 00:02:17,533
which then bumped
the cake tasting to 11:45.

71
00:02:17,667 --> 00:02:18,567
Is that okay with you?

72
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,667
-Works for me.
-Great.

73
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,667
Oh, and one more thing.

74
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,734
I bought your mother

75
00:02:21,867 --> 00:02:22,867
a lovely blanket
for her birthday.

76
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,233
Cashmere. So we can give it
to her at her party.

77
00:02:24,367 --> 00:02:25,934
Right. The surprise party.

78
00:02:26,066 --> 00:02:27,333
Shh.

79
00:02:27,467 --> 00:02:28,834
Remember, only you, me,
and your sister know,

80
00:02:28,967 --> 00:02:29,900
so don't tell anyone,

81
00:02:30,033 --> 00:02:31,100
because we don't want
your mother finding out.

82
00:02:31,233 --> 00:02:31,967
Of course.

83
00:02:33,467 --> 00:02:34,734
See you tomorrow.

84
00:02:37,633 --> 00:02:40,900
[♪♪]

85
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:48,100
So, who's helping you
plan everything on the island?

86
00:02:48,233 --> 00:02:49,066
George's mom and sister.

87
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,867
I think you met
Diana and Louise once.

88
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,834
How is Louise?

89
00:02:52,967 --> 00:02:54,767
She's excited for the wedding.

90
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,834
She recently moved home.

91
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,667
-How come?
-Bad break-up.

92
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,734
I think she just needed
a change of scenery.

93
00:02:59,867 --> 00:03:01,233
What about George's brother?

94
00:03:01,367 --> 00:03:02,166
Will he be at the party?

95
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,500
David?

96
00:03:03,633 --> 00:03:05,133
I have no idea.

97
00:03:05,266 --> 00:03:08,166
He's probably off
traveling the world somewhere.

98
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,967
He keeps sending George
these postcards

99
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,667
from faraway places,

100
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,000
like...

101
00:03:13,133 --> 00:03:14,734
hiking in Mozambique,

102
00:03:14,867 --> 00:03:17,500
or a camel ride
through the pyramids.

103
00:03:18,767 --> 00:03:19,734
That sounds amazing.

104
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:20,767
Is he cute?

105
00:03:22,533 --> 00:03:24,433
I have no idea.
I haven't seen him in years.

106
00:03:24,567 --> 00:03:27,900
Imagine waking up every day
to a new adventure.

107
00:03:28,033 --> 00:03:28,834
You ever think
of something like that?

108
00:03:28,967 --> 00:03:30,333
When I was younger.

109
00:03:30,467 --> 00:03:31,834
Actually,

110
00:03:31,967 --> 00:03:33,700
I used to dream
about going to Europe.

111
00:03:34,633 --> 00:03:37,166
My parents tried to plan
this trip once,

112
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,734
and they couldn't decide
where to go,

113
00:03:39,867 --> 00:03:41,333
and I didn't want to spend
the whole vacation

114
00:03:41,467 --> 00:03:42,834
listening to them argue,

115
00:03:42,967 --> 00:03:44,300
so I just asked
if I could stay home

116
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:45,367
and spend the summer

117
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,500
on the island
with George, Louise and David.

118
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,800
That was a long time ago.

119
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,667
And now I have

120
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,667
my dental practice
to worry about,

121
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,333
and...

122
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:54,734
let's be honest,

123
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:56,166
George really hates
to go anywhere new.

124
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,066
Did you pack
the extra phone charger?

125
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,133
Got it.

126
00:04:05,266 --> 00:04:06,300
-Aspirin?
-Check.

127
00:04:06,433 --> 00:04:08,900
So, Mr. Henry was telling me

128
00:04:09,033 --> 00:04:11,333
about this six-week expedition
he and his wife went on

129
00:04:11,467 --> 00:04:12,967
to South America.

130
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,533
-Oh, yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

131
00:04:14,667 --> 00:04:18,333
They went hiking,
ziplining.

132
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:19,367
It actually sounded
pretty amazing.

133
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,467
Hmm.

134
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,400
Sounds exhausting.

135
00:04:21,533 --> 00:04:22,667
Right.

136
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,467
Well, I was thinking

137
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,600
we might want to consider it
for our honeymoon.

138
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,567
A six-week honeymoon?

139
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,200
What about our patients?

140
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:32,467
I'm sure we could find
someone to cover for us.

141
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,834
Do you know how many people die
every year on ziplines?

142
00:04:35,867 --> 00:04:36,900
No.

143
00:04:37,033 --> 00:04:38,834
Neither do I,
but it's probably a lot.

144
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,066
I'm sure you're right, George.

145
00:04:49,033 --> 00:04:53,400
[♪♪]

146
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,100
Thank you for stopping.

147
00:05:13,233 --> 00:05:14,800
I know it wasn't
on the schedule.

148
00:05:14,934 --> 00:05:16,066
We were almost
at the house.

149
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,600
I know, George,

150
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,767
but the house
will still be there.

151
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:20,967
Come on.
It won't be long.

152
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,233
[♪♪]

153
00:05:26,533 --> 00:05:28,400
You folks,
sit anywhere you want.

154
00:05:29,367 --> 00:05:32,100
I think they only serve
raw oysters here.

155
00:05:32,233 --> 00:05:34,967
"Ring the bell,
pick a pie."

156
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,533
"Three dozen oysters,
and your pie is on the house."

157
00:05:38,667 --> 00:05:39,400
[clanging]

158
00:05:39,533 --> 00:05:41,100
[cheering]

159
00:05:42,367 --> 00:05:43,600
You know
that oysters contain toxins,

160
00:05:43,734 --> 00:05:45,533
and toxins can cause
gastroenteritis.

161
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:47,233
Yes, but Key lime pie does not.

162
00:05:47,367 --> 00:05:48,233
[waitress] Hey, folks.

163
00:05:48,367 --> 00:05:50,100
What can I get for you?

164
00:05:50,233 --> 00:05:52,533
Just a water with lemon
for me, please.

165
00:05:52,667 --> 00:05:55,100
I would like one slice
of Key lime pie, please.

166
00:05:55,233 --> 00:05:56,800
Oh, you can't have any pie

167
00:05:56,934 --> 00:05:58,767
unless you finish
a platter of oysters.

168
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,734
House rules.

169
00:05:59,867 --> 00:06:02,166
Oh.

170
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,200
Well, what if I were
to tell you

171
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:05,467
that I have a shellfish allergy?

172
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,834
I would tell you

173
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:08,633
that you might enjoy
Burger Hut up the street.

174
00:06:09,567 --> 00:06:10,867
Fine. I will have
a glass of Chardonnay.

175
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,233
Fancy.

176
00:06:14,266 --> 00:06:15,300

This place seems fun.

181
00:06:22,066 --> 00:06:23,433
Okay, here we go.

182
00:06:23,567 --> 00:06:25,200
No, no. No, no, no.

183
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:26,367
I actually ordered
a glass of Chardonnay.

184
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,300
We don't have that.

185
00:06:28,433 --> 00:06:30,600
-You don't have Chardonnay?
-No.

186
00:06:30,734 --> 00:06:32,266
And I am driving.

187
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,300
Okay, leave that there then.

188
00:06:34,433 --> 00:06:35,400
Knock yourselves out.

189
00:06:38,233 --> 00:06:40,166
Can we leave now?

190
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,433
[clanging]

191
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,467
[cheering]

192
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,000
[♪♪]

193
00:07:09,967 --> 00:07:11,400
[phone ringing]

194
00:07:11,533 --> 00:07:13,166
It's the office.
I'd better get this.

195
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,500
Oh, you'll be on the phone
for hours.

196
00:07:15,633 --> 00:07:17,166
Come on, you're off the clock.

197
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,367
I'm sure whatever it is,
Denise can handle it.

198
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,734
What if it's an emergency?

199
00:07:19,867 --> 00:07:22,367
Then she'll call Dr. Willis.

200
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,266
George, please.

201
00:07:26,066 --> 00:07:27,033
Fine.

202
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:32,433
Hey, Louise.

203
00:07:32,567 --> 00:07:34,166
Hello. Hello.

204
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,767
Not going to give your brother
a hug hello?

205
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,166
Not now, George.
I have to find my keys.

206
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,300
[Elizabeth sighs]

207
00:07:40,633 --> 00:07:41,700
[George] Oh.

208
00:07:41,834 --> 00:07:44,033
Oh, but I will give
Elizabeth one.

209
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:45,400
Hi, Louise.

210
00:07:48,066 --> 00:07:48,934
Hello, Mother.

211
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,200
Hi, Tilly!

212
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,367
Oh, there she is.

213
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,734
My soon-to-be daughter-in-law.

214
00:07:54,867 --> 00:07:56,400
It's so good to be here.

215
00:07:56,533 --> 00:07:57,734
I'm so happy
to have you both.

216
00:07:57,867 --> 00:07:58,667
[cell phone ringing]

217
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,433
They've tried
calling me twice now.

218
00:08:00,567 --> 00:08:01,600
I really should get this.

219
00:08:01,734 --> 00:08:03,166
-George.
-Two minutes, I promise.

220
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,667
This is Dr. Belling.

221
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,800
What's all this?

222
00:08:05,934 --> 00:08:08,433
Oh, Eugene dropped it off
about a half an hour ago.

223
00:08:08,567 --> 00:08:09,734
It's for you.

224
00:08:09,867 --> 00:08:11,066
It's from some party store.

225
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,066
Oh, those must be

226
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,934
the decorations
for the engagement party.

227
00:08:14,066 --> 00:08:16,600
They weren't supposed
to arrive until tomorrow.

228
00:08:16,734 --> 00:08:17,800
I have it right here
in my list.

229
00:08:17,934 --> 00:08:19,567
Well, I guess
we're ahead of schedule.

230
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,166
Oh, my.

231
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:25,100
That is very detailed list,
Elizabeth.

232
00:08:27,266 --> 00:08:31,467
I don't think I've met anyone
quite as organized as you.

233
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,100
Found them!

234
00:08:33,233 --> 00:08:33,900
Where are you off to, Louise?

235
00:08:34,033 --> 00:08:35,900
The airport.
To pick up David.

236
00:08:36,033 --> 00:08:36,967
David's coming home?

237
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,066
Yeah, well,

238
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,066
word has it

239
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,233
that he's...

240
00:08:40,367 --> 00:08:41,400
arriving early

241
00:08:41,533 --> 00:08:43,000
for the...

242
00:08:43,133 --> 00:08:44,834
surprise birthday party
I'm not supposed to know about.

243
00:08:44,967 --> 00:08:45,834
No, no, no, no,no.

244
00:08:45,967 --> 00:08:47,934
Don't worry. No.

245
00:08:48,066 --> 00:08:50,000
I can act very surprised.

246
00:08:50,133 --> 00:08:51,500
I mean, don't forget

247
00:08:51,633 --> 00:08:53,300
I was the star

248
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:55,166
of many high-school musicals
in my day.

249
00:08:56,533 --> 00:08:58,066
Oh! Oh!

250
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,300
A surprise? For me?

251
00:09:00,433 --> 00:09:01,700
Oh, you shouldn't have!

252
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:02,700
Oh...

253
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:04,300
you are--
you're pretty good.

254
00:09:04,433 --> 00:09:05,734
I know.
I think I missed my calling.

255
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:15,967
How's your room?

256
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,967
Mother has officially
turned it into a museum.

257
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:19,867
I wouldn't be surprised

258
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,200
if she starts
charging admission.

259
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,133
You think your house
is like a museum,

260
00:09:23,266 --> 00:09:24,867
don't you remember
that horrible yellow wallpaper

261
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
at my house across the street?

262
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:27,900
I vaguely remember.

263
00:09:28,033 --> 00:09:30,333
I used to love
coming over here.

264
00:09:33,033 --> 00:09:35,200
You all were so welcoming
and kind.

265
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:37,166
That was my escape.

266
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,200
There was always
something happening here.

267
00:09:40,867 --> 00:09:42,033
Including...

268
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,500
those scavenger hunts

269
00:09:43,633 --> 00:09:44,900
your mom
used to throw for us.

270
00:09:45,033 --> 00:09:45,934
Oh, those.

271
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,333
"Oh, those"?
They were fun.

272
00:09:49,967 --> 00:09:50,767
Maybe we should do one
this weekend.

273
00:09:51,934 --> 00:09:53,133
Really, Elizabeth?

274
00:09:53,266 --> 00:09:54,500
We're adults now.

275
00:09:54,633 --> 00:09:55,934
Haven't we grown
past all of that?

276
00:09:57,266 --> 00:09:58,166
I suppose so.

277
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,133
Oh...

278
00:10:04,266 --> 00:10:06,266
look at the treehouse
your dad built.

279
00:10:08,266 --> 00:10:09,700
Peter was so handy.

280
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,033
Still, it's amazing it's up.

281
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,333
George?

282
00:10:19,467 --> 00:10:20,667
Hmm?

283
00:10:22,867 --> 00:10:24,400
You know, it's all right
to talk about him.

284
00:10:26,633 --> 00:10:28,767
It still feels like
he was just here yesterday.

285
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,800
I just wish he could have
lived long enough

286
00:10:32,934 --> 00:10:34,100
to see what I've done
with my career.

287
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,367
He would have been
so proud of you.

288
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,700
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

289
00:10:48,834 --> 00:10:49,633
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance

290
00:10:49,767 --> 00:10:51,734
to give you
a proper hello yesterday.

291
00:10:51,867 --> 00:10:53,066
I was running around like crazy.

292
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,834
No, it's fine.

293
00:10:54,967 --> 00:10:56,133
How did everything go
picking up David?

294
00:10:56,266 --> 00:10:57,166
Oh, fine.

295
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,567
You know David.

296
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,066
I picked him up
at the airport,

297
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,266
and the minute
we drove over the bridge,

298
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,867
he insisted
on getting out and walking.

299
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,300
He got up early and went
into town this morning.

300
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:08,400
It's been so long
since he's been home.

301
00:11:08,533 --> 00:11:10,166
Yeah, I don't think
he's gonna stay for very long.

302
00:11:11,233 --> 00:11:12,367
You don't think so?

303
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,367
You know David.

304
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,467
He's a wanderer.

305
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,533
A free spirit
traveling the globe,

306
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:18,967
looking for
his next big adventure.

307
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,633
I doubt that there's
anything in Echo Beach

308
00:11:20,767 --> 00:11:21,934
that's gonna keep him here
for very long.

309
00:11:22,066 --> 00:11:22,934
[knocking]

310
00:11:23,066 --> 00:11:23,867
[door opens]

311
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,934
Hello, Louise.

312
00:11:25,066 --> 00:11:26,600
Hi, Eugene.

313
00:11:26,734 --> 00:11:27,900
Elizabeth, great to see you
back on the island.

314
00:11:28,033 --> 00:11:28,900
Hi, Eugene.

315
00:11:29,033 --> 00:11:31,867
Louise, that band
I was telling you about--

316
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,433
they're playing
at the Brewery this Sunday.

317
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:34,633
Would you like to...

318
00:11:34,767 --> 00:11:35,700
Sorry, Eugene.

319
00:11:35,834 --> 00:11:37,300
I'm just really busy.

320
00:11:37,433 --> 00:11:39,700
Oh. Well. Right.

321
00:11:39,834 --> 00:11:41,266
Of course,
if you change your mind...

322
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,667
[Louise] Really busy, Eugene.

323
00:11:43,767 --> 00:11:45,367
Sorry.

324
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,433
Catch you later.

325
00:11:46,567 --> 00:11:47,633
Thanks.
See you tomorrow.

326
00:11:47,767 --> 00:11:48,800
-Bye, Eugene.
-See you, Elizabeth.

327
00:11:55,233 --> 00:11:56,867
What?
What's that look for?

328
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,533
He likes you.

329
00:11:58,667 --> 00:11:59,633
[laughs]

330
00:11:59,767 --> 00:12:01,000
Don't be ridiculous.

331
00:12:01,133 --> 00:12:02,700
Eugene's a mailman.
He likes everyone.

332
00:12:02,834 --> 00:12:05,000
No, he likes you.

333
00:12:05,133 --> 00:12:07,767
Please, Elizabeth.
That ship has sailed for me.

334
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,367
Come on, Louise.

335
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,433
You've got to give love
another chance.

336
00:12:10,567 --> 00:12:11,433
With Eugene?

337
00:12:11,567 --> 00:12:12,300
Why not?

338
00:12:12,433 --> 00:12:13,467
Well, because.

339
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,433
Because why?

340
00:12:15,567 --> 00:12:17,266
Because...

341
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,133
because I don't even know

342
00:12:18,266 --> 00:12:19,333
how much
a first-class stamp costs.

343
00:12:19,467 --> 00:12:20,367
That's why.

344
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,467
That's your reason?

345
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,900
It's perfectly valid.

346
00:12:24,433 --> 00:12:26,633
Have you ever
stopped to think...

347
00:12:26,767 --> 00:12:29,467
that Eugene McClain
of the U.S. Postal Service

348
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,266
might just be your soulmate?

349
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,266
He could be the one
who completes you.

350
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,300
Well...

351
00:12:34,433 --> 00:12:35,633
I think that a soulmate

352
00:12:35,767 --> 00:12:36,834
should be someone

353
00:12:36,967 --> 00:12:39,367
that inspires you
to complete yourself.

354
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,533
Okay.

355
00:12:44,233 --> 00:12:44,867
I've got to go pick up
the ice cream

356
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,800
for your mom's surprise party.

357
00:12:45,934 --> 00:12:48,000
Oh, she is going to be
so surprised.

358
00:12:48,133 --> 00:12:49,367
Yeah.

359
00:12:50,667 --> 00:12:51,500
Thank you for doing that.
You don't mind?

360
00:12:51,633 --> 00:12:53,467
No. I love going into town.

361
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,867
You never know
who you'll run into.

362
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,400
[♪♪]

363
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,700
-Hi. Welcome.
-Thank you.

364
00:13:03,834 --> 00:13:04,767
What can I get you?

365
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,266
I would like
three pints of vanilla, please,

366
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,233
but one of the pints I'd like
in two separate containers.

367
00:13:09,367 --> 00:13:10,667
In one of the containers,
I would like 1/4,

368
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,834
in the other container,
I would like 3/4.

369
00:13:12,967 --> 00:13:14,767
Then I would like
two pints of chocolate,

370
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,600
but I want a half pint separated
into two individual cups.

371
00:13:16,734 --> 00:13:18,100
Then I would like
three pints of strawberry

372
00:13:18,233 --> 00:13:19,867
distributed the exact same way
as the vanilla.

373
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,834
-Right. Uh...
-Okay--

374
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,266
I've got a typed-up list
for you, if you like.

375
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,300
Double spaced.

376
00:13:27,033 --> 00:13:27,867
What's your name, my friend?

377
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,700
[employee] I'm Ricky.
What's up, bro?

378
00:13:29,834 --> 00:13:30,700
Can I get a pint

379
00:13:30,834 --> 00:13:32,333
of the Chocolate Belly Booster,
please?

380
00:13:32,467 --> 00:13:33,433
Yeah. Thanks, man.

381
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:40,266
Hi, David.

382
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,066
Oh, hi, Elizabeth.
How are you?

383
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,100
Bring it in.

384
00:13:43,233 --> 00:13:44,900
Oh...

385
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:45,767
It's okay.

386
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:47,767
So...

387
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,867
David Belling,

388
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,433
back from
his latest adventure.

389
00:13:50,567 --> 00:13:51,734
Here I am.

390
00:13:51,867 --> 00:13:53,233
And how does it feel
to be home?

391
00:13:53,367 --> 00:13:54,233
Feels good.

392
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:55,367
Yeah.

393
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,467
Amazing, actually.

394
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,333
I'm really excited
to catch up with everybody.

395
00:13:57,467 --> 00:13:59,033
Hmm.

396
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:00,967
Congratulations on the wedding.

397
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,100
Very nice to hear
about you and George.

398
00:14:03,233 --> 00:14:04,066
Thank you very much.

399
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,567
I've got to know.

400
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,000
How did old Georgie
pop the question?

401
00:14:08,133 --> 00:14:09,667
Oh!

402
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,066
Well, um,

403
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,767
we were sitting
in the break room at the office,

404
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:16,100
and we looked at each other
and thought we get along great,

405
00:14:16,233 --> 00:14:17,066
we're very similar,

406
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,467
our practice is thriving.

407
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,300
It just seemed like

408
00:14:19,433 --> 00:14:20,567
the most logical time
to do it.

409
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,233
Sensible.

410
00:14:22,367 --> 00:14:23,333
Exactly.

411
00:14:24,633 --> 00:14:26,066
Thank you, David,
for understanding.

412
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,900
-Of course.
-After all,

413
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,233
life doesn't need to be
a romance novel.

414
00:14:29,367 --> 00:14:30,300
No.

415
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,467
Who needs romance?

416
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,400
So, how long
do you intend to be home?

417
00:14:37,533 --> 00:14:38,400
Not very long.

418
00:14:38,533 --> 00:14:40,333
I've been teaching
at a school in Mumbai

419
00:14:40,467 --> 00:14:42,066
and I promised my students
I'd be back soon,

420
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,567
so...

421
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,734
probably right after
the engagement party.

422
00:14:44,867 --> 00:14:46,166
Well, you will be missed.

423
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,667
That was
a very nice thing to say.

424
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,633
[Ricky] Hey, so,

425
00:14:48,767 --> 00:14:51,500
it's going to be $37.95
for the pints.

426
00:14:52,867 --> 00:14:54,166
I got this.

427
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,600
Oh, no, no, no.
You don't need to do that.

428
00:14:56,533 --> 00:14:57,367
Sure, I got it.

429
00:14:59,967 --> 00:15:01,100
Richard,

430
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:04,734
you wouldn't happen to take
Yen or Rupees, would you?

431
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,066
I don't think so.

432
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:08,834
I got it.

433
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,367
Thank you.

434
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,367
I'll get the next one, okay?

435
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,567
Thanks, buddy.

436
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,367
So is that a lucky charm?

437
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,633
You don't recognize it?

438
00:15:21,767 --> 00:15:23,166
I do not.

439
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,567
It's yours.

440
00:15:26,533 --> 00:15:27,333
You used to have it
on your backpack

441
00:15:27,467 --> 00:15:28,333
all through middle school.

442
00:15:29,533 --> 00:15:30,834
So how did you end up with it?

443
00:15:30,967 --> 00:15:31,900
Funny story.

444
00:15:32,967 --> 00:15:34,300
When we were about 12 years old,

445
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,400
me, you, Louise, George,
we went to the movies.

446
00:15:37,533 --> 00:15:41,133
I was being myself,
as I am,

447
00:15:41,266 --> 00:15:43,700
but you decided to report me
to the usher for speaking.

448
00:15:43,834 --> 00:15:46,533
Oh, I am sure I didn't do that.

449
00:15:46,667 --> 00:15:48,233
Oh, you most certainly did.

450
00:15:48,367 --> 00:15:50,867
And while you three were
walking off into the sunset,

451
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,633
and I was being accosted
by security,

452
00:15:54,767 --> 00:15:56,800
this rabbit's foot
fell off your bag.

453
00:15:56,934 --> 00:15:57,734
I picked it up.

454
00:15:57,867 --> 00:15:58,533
I was going
to give it back to you,

455
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:01,300
but then I thought to myself...

456
00:16:01,433 --> 00:16:02,633
"No."

457
00:16:02,767 --> 00:16:05,100
Wow, David.

458
00:16:05,233 --> 00:16:06,900
I'm so sorry
that I annoyed you that day.

459
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:09,800
"Annoyed" is a bit
of a strong word, but...

460
00:16:09,934 --> 00:16:10,834
you used it.

461
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:14,433
Napkins?

462
00:16:15,867 --> 00:16:19,233
Do you realize the hundreds
of annoying things

463
00:16:19,367 --> 00:16:20,934
you used to do on a daily basis?

464
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,734
No.

465
00:16:24,867 --> 00:16:26,133
But you should have
said something.

466
00:16:26,266 --> 00:16:27,400
I did!

467
00:16:27,533 --> 00:16:28,633
You just don't remember!

468
00:16:28,767 --> 00:16:30,600
Well, that just sounds
very plausible.

469
00:16:31,834 --> 00:16:33,100
How about this--

470
00:16:33,233 --> 00:16:34,767
let's take this opportunity

471
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,133
for you to get off your chest

472
00:16:36,266 --> 00:16:38,033
all the things I ever did
to annoy you.

473
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:39,233
Let me have it.

474
00:16:39,367 --> 00:16:40,467
How much time do you have?

475
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,767
Alright, there was the time

476
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,867
your dad drove us
to get a Christmas tree.

477
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,967
You yelled shotgun,

478
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,567
ran ahead of everyone,

479
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,867
and made us wait outside the car
for over an hour.

480
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,300
-I did that.
-Mm-hmm.

481
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,367
Or July 4, 1997.

482
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,567
Do you remember
what happened that day?

483
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,900
Fireworks?

484
00:16:59,033 --> 00:17:01,300
You snatched
the fries off of my plate

485
00:17:01,433 --> 00:17:02,800
and stole my soda.

486
00:17:02,934 --> 00:17:04,467
Wow.

487
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,700
What a monster.

488
00:17:05,834 --> 00:17:07,433
Just a thought--

489
00:17:07,567 --> 00:17:09,934
-1997 that was?
-Uh-huh.

490
00:17:10,066 --> 00:17:12,200
Maybe you should
let that one go.

491
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:13,500
See you back
at the house, David.

492
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:14,800
Bye, Lizzie.

493
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,367
Alright. Shh, shh, shh.
She's coming.

494
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,300
Gran, come here.
You've got to hide.

495
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,700
Yeah, come on.

496
00:17:27,133 --> 00:17:28,967
[door opens]

497
00:17:32,233 --> 00:17:33,667
Surprise!

498
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,266
Oh!

499
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,300
I can't believe it!

500
00:17:37,433 --> 00:17:38,800
What a surprise!

501
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:40,867
Somebody told her.

502
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,033
Yes, they did.

503
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:44,033
It was--

504
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:44,867
It was me.

505
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,033
[Louise] David!
How could you?

506
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,166
I'm a terrible person.
What do you want?

507
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,900
[laughing]

508
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,266
You know,

509
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,967
you don't have to take the blame

510
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,133
for something
that you didn't do.

511
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,967
Ah, so it was you
who spilled the beans.

512
00:18:04,066 --> 00:18:05,166
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

513
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,667
You know, come to think of it,

514
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,200
you would have been
my most likely suspect.

515
00:18:10,233 --> 00:18:11,367
Naughty.

516
00:18:20,133 --> 00:18:21,066
Thank you.

517
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,266
Thank you, all,
for this wonderful surprise.

518
00:18:24,834 --> 00:18:27,166
My wish was that Peter
could see us all together

519
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,834
having such a marvelous time.

520
00:18:28,967 --> 00:18:30,400
He's right here with us, Mom.

521
00:18:33,033 --> 00:18:35,100
If I could just take a minute

522
00:18:35,233 --> 00:18:36,734
to talk about
my wonderful children...

523
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:38,100
Oh, get ready for the annual

524
00:18:38,233 --> 00:18:40,367
"why I'm so proud
of my children" speech.

525
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,166
I mean, just look at
my extraordinary son, George.

526
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,867
Getting married
to the most wonderful girl.

527
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,700
I mean, the Belling family

528
00:18:47,834 --> 00:18:50,433
has been in love with Elizabeth
for it seems like forever.

529
00:18:50,567 --> 00:18:53,500
And George and Elizabeth's
dental practice

530
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:55,433
is just thriving.

531
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:56,400
[cell phone buzzing]

532
00:18:56,533 --> 00:18:57,867
Excuse me.

533
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,934
Hello? This is Dr. Belling.

534
00:18:59,066 --> 00:19:00,500
Now, where was I?

535
00:19:00,633 --> 00:19:02,567
Oh, yes.

536
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,500
I want to say how proud I am
of my amazing daughter, Louise.

537
00:19:06,633 --> 00:19:07,900
An award-winning artist.

538
00:19:08,033 --> 00:19:10,934
And my truly remarkable
son, David.

539
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,767
Travels the globe,

540
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,133
teaching children in need.

541
00:19:15,266 --> 00:19:16,567
You're such a good man.

542
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,333
Thank you.
Very kind.

543
00:19:18,467 --> 00:19:19,867
If you ask me...

544
00:19:21,033 --> 00:19:22,033
Here we go...

545
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,500
David needs to stay
in one place and get married

546
00:19:24,633 --> 00:19:25,500
like his brother.

547
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,433
I got married at 18.

548
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:30,300
What's your problem, mister?

549
00:19:30,433 --> 00:19:31,767
[David]
It's a fair point, Gran.

550
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:32,867
The answer to that

551
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,800
is I just can't find someone
as special as you.

552
00:19:35,934 --> 00:19:38,500
Yeah, yeah, always the charmer.

553
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,100
You, listen to me.

554
00:19:41,233 --> 00:19:43,266
Yes, Ma'am.

555
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,800
Love is not something you find.

556
00:19:46,934 --> 00:19:48,734
Love is something
that finds you--

557
00:19:48,867 --> 00:19:50,033
when you least expect it.

558
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,233
George, what is it?

559
00:19:56,367 --> 00:19:57,500
Oh, it's Mrs. Valenzuela.

560
00:19:57,633 --> 00:19:58,834
She says she has
an unbearable toothache.

561
00:19:58,967 --> 00:20:00,900
Well, can't Dr. Willis
handle it?

562
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,400
You know Mrs. Valenzuela
and her dental anxiety.

563
00:20:03,533 --> 00:20:05,800
She had such a bad experience
with her last dentist.

564
00:20:05,934 --> 00:20:07,300
Her son said
she'd only see me.

565
00:20:07,433 --> 00:20:09,467
Well, I don't blame her.

566
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,800
I can't think of
a more brilliant dentist

567
00:20:10,934 --> 00:20:12,166
to handle whatever problem
she's having.

568
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,967
Well, I'll only be gone
the night.

569
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:14,967
I've scheduled for her
to come in

570
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,100
first thing in the morning.

571
00:20:16,233 --> 00:20:17,667
Will you survive
without me?

572
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,767
Mm. I'll try.

573
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,433
I'm going to grab my things.

574
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,500
[thunder rumbling]

575
00:20:28,633 --> 00:20:30,100
Alright, go inside.

576
00:20:32,467 --> 00:20:34,233
Hello, Tilly.

577
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:35,633
Big storm coming, George.

578
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:36,934
Think so?

579
00:20:37,066 --> 00:20:38,000
Oh, yeah, look at those clouds.

580
00:20:38,133 --> 00:20:40,066
[storm rumbling]

581
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,800
Drive safe, okay?

582
00:20:41,934 --> 00:20:42,934
Thank you.

583
00:20:43,066 --> 00:20:43,900
Hold down the fort.

584
00:20:44,033 --> 00:20:45,200
I will.

585
00:20:46,266 --> 00:20:47,166
Hey, George?

586
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,066
I read that...

587
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,333
that article that you wrote
in the dental magazine.

588
00:20:54,467 --> 00:20:55,834
What did you think?

589
00:20:55,967 --> 00:20:57,266
It thought it was
really interesting,

590
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,467
especially the part about

591
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,400
how oral infections in childhood

592
00:21:01,533 --> 00:21:04,500
could actually increase
the risk of that...

593
00:21:04,633 --> 00:21:06,467
that thing in adulthood.

594
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,867
You mean atherosclerosis?

595
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
That's the thing.
That's the thing.

596
00:21:10,133 --> 00:21:13,066
I thought it was very cool
how you figured that out.

597
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,467
Well, you didn't understand
a word, did you?

598
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,567
No, not a word,

599
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,400
but...

600
00:21:18,533 --> 00:21:19,934
that does not make it
any less impressive, buddy.

601
00:21:21,033 --> 00:21:21,867
You're impressed?

602
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,667
Of course.

603
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,533
I'm very proud
of my big brother.

604
00:21:26,667 --> 00:21:28,066
Well, I'm...

605
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,667
I'm very proud
of you, too, you know?

606
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,367
Oh, I gotta hear this.
Go ahead.

607
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,500
Sometimes,

608
00:21:34,633 --> 00:21:35,667
I...

609
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,500
I wish that I could be as--

610
00:21:37,633 --> 00:21:38,500
liberated as you,

611
00:21:38,633 --> 00:21:39,533
and just take off

612
00:21:39,667 --> 00:21:41,066
and live day by day,

613
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,500
as life comes.

614
00:21:42,633 --> 00:21:44,233
Well, okay.

615
00:21:44,367 --> 00:21:45,567
I'll book tickets
right now, George.

616
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,533
Where do you want to go?

617
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,100
Come on, why not?

618
00:21:50,467 --> 00:21:52,066
Well, that's just the thing.

619
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,500
See, I'm not
a why-not kind of guy.

620
00:21:55,633 --> 00:21:57,233
I'm the guy that just asks why.

621
00:21:59,266 --> 00:22:00,200
Almost had you.

622
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:01,300
Did. Almost.

623
00:22:01,433 --> 00:22:02,600
-You were gonna come.
-Almost.

624
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:04,967
Have a good night, David.

625
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:05,867
You too, buddy.

626
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,800
Safe drive, okay?

627
00:22:06,934 --> 00:22:07,934
Thank you.

628
00:22:10,667 --> 00:22:11,467
[car engine starting]

629
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:28,600

[loud rock music playing]

631
00:22:35,834 --> 00:22:37,200
What is going on?

632
00:22:39,033 --> 00:22:40,400
[loud rock music playing]

633
00:22:40,533 --> 00:22:41,533
I can't believe this.

634
00:22:44,867 --> 00:22:46,567
[loud rock music playing]

635
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,967
[loud rock music playing]

[David singing]

637
00:22:57,066 --> 00:22:58,166
David!

638
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,433
David?

639
00:23:01,367 --> 00:23:02,834
[loud rock music playing]

640
00:23:02,967 --> 00:23:03,967
Cake?

641
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,433
No, I do not want any cake!

642
00:23:06,567 --> 00:23:08,467
Do you realize
it's 2:00 in the morning?

643
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,300
I'm surprised you haven't
woken up the whole--

644
00:23:09,433 --> 00:23:11,100
You seem a little tense,
Lizzie.

645
00:23:11,233 --> 00:23:12,400
I am tense!

646
00:23:12,533 --> 00:23:14,700
Because I was just woken up
by David's one-man rock band!

647
00:23:15,867 --> 00:23:16,734
Well, since you're up,

648
00:23:16,867 --> 00:23:17,800
why don't I get you
a little something?

649
00:23:17,934 --> 00:23:18,734
You could get me something.

650
00:23:18,867 --> 00:23:20,800
You could get me
turning down the music

651
00:23:20,934 --> 00:23:22,467
because some of us
are trying to sleep.

652
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,567
You're absolutely correct.

653
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,500
Some apology milk.

654
00:23:25,633 --> 00:23:26,734
I'm sorry.

655
00:23:26,867 --> 00:23:28,000
I'm still on Tibetan time.

656
00:23:28,133 --> 00:23:30,166
Well, the rest of us
are not on Tibetan time.

657
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,400
The rest of us
are trying to maintain

658
00:23:31,533 --> 00:23:33,834
our usual eight and a quarter
hours of sleep per night.

659
00:23:33,967 --> 00:23:35,000
[pop music playing]

660
00:23:35,133 --> 00:23:37,066
That is a very specific amount
of time, Elizabeth.

661
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,433
[music playing]

662
00:23:38,567 --> 00:23:39,400
I love this song!
Isn't it so good?

663
00:23:39,533 --> 00:23:40,767
It just makes you want to dance.

664
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,400
No, I do not love that song.

665
00:23:42,533 --> 00:23:43,900
Feel free to help yourself
to that cake, alright?

666
00:23:44,033 --> 00:23:45,100
I'd rather not.

667
00:23:45,233 --> 00:23:47,667
Okay, fell free
to join me in a dance.

668
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,600
I'm gonna be over here dancing.

669
00:23:48,734 --> 00:23:51,300
[♪♪]

670
00:23:51,433 --> 00:23:54,633
David, it is
2:00 in the morning.

671
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:55,900
I want to go to sleep,

672
00:23:56,033 --> 00:23:58,000
I do not want
to have a dance party,

673
00:23:58,133 --> 00:23:59,633
and I do not want to eat
peanut-butter cake.

674
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,433
Hold on, now.

675
00:24:03,767 --> 00:24:04,667
Is there peanuts in that?

676
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,834
Yes.

677
00:24:05,967 --> 00:24:07,800
What's the matter with you?
Can't you taste them?

678
00:24:07,934 --> 00:24:09,166
[David clears throat]
No.

679
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,200
You're funny.

680
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:12,400
No.
[clears throat]

681
00:24:12,533 --> 00:24:14,166
That's not funny, David.

682
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,200
[David gags]

683
00:24:18,133 --> 00:24:19,400
David! David!

684
00:24:19,533 --> 00:24:20,467
David, are you okay?

685
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,000
David, wake up!
Wake up!

686
00:24:22,133 --> 00:24:24,066
-Wake up!
-Shh.

687
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,166
I'm trying to sleep.

688
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:27,300
[rages]

689
00:24:27,433 --> 00:24:28,800
Is that your idea of a joke?

690
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:30,734
More of
a performance piece, really.

691
00:24:30,867 --> 00:24:31,834
You think it's funny

692
00:24:31,967 --> 00:24:33,033
to make me believe
you're dead?

693
00:24:33,166 --> 00:24:34,400
I was going for unconscious,

694
00:24:34,533 --> 00:24:37,066
but I'll be the first to admit
that I'm not a very good actor.

695
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,367
You have been trouble
from the very start.

696
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,500
You take nothing seriously.

697
00:24:41,633 --> 00:24:43,066
You break all the rules--

698
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,066
and I don't like rule-breakers!

699
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,066
So here's
what we're going to do, David.

700
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,667
We're going to keep our distance

701
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,900
for the rest of the time
you're home.

702
00:24:51,033 --> 00:24:52,834
We're going to be
like two ships

703
00:24:52,967 --> 00:24:54,333
passing in the night.

704
00:24:57,033 --> 00:24:58,367
That's poetic.

705
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,600
I'm sorry.

706
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,767
[George] Excuse me.
What's going on here?

707
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,400
[man]
Lightning struck the bridge.

708
00:25:12,533 --> 00:25:14,700
[engine revving]

709
00:25:14,834 --> 00:25:16,266
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where are you going?

710
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,867
You can't cross the bridge.

711
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,200
Island's closed.

712
00:25:20,333 --> 00:25:21,633
Inspector should
be here shortly,

713
00:25:21,767 --> 00:25:23,233
to let us know
how the assessment's going.

714
00:25:23,367 --> 00:25:24,467
Is there much damage?

715
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,567
Well, far as I can tell,

716
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,600
the lightning looks like
it might have got the kingpost,

717
00:25:28,734 --> 00:25:30,567
some of the framing braces,

718
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,100
probably 10 or 12 transoms.

719
00:25:32,233 --> 00:25:33,767
Huh. I see.

720
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,100
Well, then I will
just wait here

721
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:36,400
until the repairs are done.

722
00:25:36,533 --> 00:25:38,700
Alright.
Suit yourself.

723
00:25:38,834 --> 00:25:39,700
Could be three or four days,

724
00:25:39,834 --> 00:25:40,734
maybe even a couple weeks.

725
00:25:40,867 --> 00:25:41,734
Two weeks?

726
00:25:41,867 --> 00:25:43,533
I--

727
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,300
No, I need to get across
the bridge today.

728
00:25:45,433 --> 00:25:47,066
My engagement party
is on Friday,

729
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,066
and I promised
to meet my fiancée today

730
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,200
so that we could meet
with the...

731
00:25:50,333 --> 00:25:51,600
the florist,

732
00:25:51,734 --> 00:25:52,967
and the rental company,

733
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,166
and the wedding-cake designer.

734
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:57,533
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint
you and your fiancée,

735
00:25:57,667 --> 00:25:58,600
but you two lovebirds

736
00:25:58,734 --> 00:26:00,200
are gonna have to
plan your wedding

737
00:26:00,333 --> 00:26:01,333
from this side of the bridge.

738
00:26:05,433 --> 00:26:06,533
Hmm. Hmm-hmm!

739
00:26:15,467 --> 00:26:16,967
Good morning, Tilly.
How are you?

740
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,066
[Tilly groans]

741
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,467
Well, I'm good.
Thank you for asking.

742
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,633
How did you sleep?

743
00:26:23,834 --> 00:26:25,467
How did I sleep?
Oh, I slept like a baby.

744
00:26:27,166 --> 00:26:28,200
How about you?
What's your name?

745
00:26:28,333 --> 00:26:29,300
[Tilly groans]

746
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,000
Tilly. Shh.

747
00:26:32,133 --> 00:26:33,200
You're right there.
She can hear you.

748
00:26:33,333 --> 00:26:34,367
[scoffs]

749
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,700
[phone rings]

750
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,400
-[Elizabeth] Hello? George?
-[George] Hello?

751
00:26:39,533 --> 00:26:41,367
[Elizabeth] You're breaking up.
I can't hear you.

752
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,467
The bridge?

753
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,367
Did you just say
lightning strike?

754
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,633
[static, garbled conversation]

755
00:26:46,767 --> 00:26:48,166
Hello? George?

756
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,834
You're breaking up again.
I can't hear you.

757
00:26:49,967 --> 00:26:51,200
[static, garbled conversation]

758
00:26:57,433 --> 00:26:58,867
Did you hear about
a lightning strike

759
00:26:59,000 --> 00:26:59,834
on the bridge?

760
00:26:59,967 --> 00:27:02,200
Yes.

761
00:27:02,333 --> 00:27:04,633
So why didn't you tell me?

762
00:27:06,133 --> 00:27:07,467
Two ships
passing in the night, right?

763
00:27:18,166 --> 00:27:21,567
[♪♪]

764
00:27:27,967 --> 00:27:29,066
Oh, hi.

765
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,600
Need a ride?

766
00:27:30,734 --> 00:27:31,600
No thank you.

767
00:27:31,734 --> 00:27:33,433
Are you sure?

768
00:27:33,567 --> 00:27:35,200
Looks like you've got
a lot of junk in your hands.

769
00:27:35,333 --> 00:27:36,667
It isn't junk.

770
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,066
It's important research.

771
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,700
I'm planning a wedding,
you know?

772
00:27:39,834 --> 00:27:41,066
Oh, I do know.

773
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,834
I also know
George has got your car,

774
00:27:42,967 --> 00:27:43,767
so why don't you hop in,

775
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:44,600
I'll take you
wherever you want to go.

776
00:27:44,734 --> 00:27:46,166
I'm just going
to the florist,

777
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,233
only a few blocks away.

778
00:27:47,367 --> 00:27:49,033
Perfect. I'll get you there
in two minutes.

779
00:27:49,166 --> 00:27:51,066
I'm fine.
Have a nice day.

780
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,967
Look, Lizzie. Stop.

781
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,400
You're marrying my brother.

782
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,700
We're going to be family.

783
00:27:59,834 --> 00:28:00,667
For George's sake,

784
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,700
how about you and I
call a truce?

785
00:28:05,233 --> 00:28:06,967
For George?

786
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,333
Alright.

787
00:28:08,467 --> 00:28:09,367
Truce.

788
00:28:11,266 --> 00:28:13,500
Well, hold on, now.

789
00:28:13,633 --> 00:28:15,100
Are you sure
you don't want a ride?

790
00:28:18,433 --> 00:28:20,066
Okay, but only if you promise
to stay inside the vehicle

791
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,066
while I'm talking
to the vendors. Deal?

792
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,934
Deal. Hop in.

793
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:33,133
[♪♪]

794
00:28:39,567 --> 00:28:43,000
[♪♪]

795
00:28:48,066 --> 00:28:49,633
Let's go for a walk.

796
00:28:51,533 --> 00:28:52,900
Good girl.
Hey, hey, hey.

797
00:28:53,033 --> 00:28:54,000
Wait for me.

798
00:28:54,133 --> 00:28:56,767
So, as you can see
from my notes and diagrams,

799
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:57,700
I have a pretty clear idea

800
00:28:57,834 --> 00:28:59,066
of what I want
the cake to look like.

801
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,300
I see.

802
00:29:00,433 --> 00:29:03,066
A six-tier monochromatic cake,

803
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,633
with sugar petals down the side,

804
00:29:04,767 --> 00:29:08,000
and then a single sugar pearl
at the tip of each leaf.

805
00:29:08,133 --> 00:29:09,367
Lovely.
We can do that.

806
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,000
Great.

807
00:29:11,133 --> 00:29:11,900
Be with you in a minute, sir.

808
00:29:12,033 --> 00:29:13,300
I'm good.

809
00:29:13,433 --> 00:29:14,433
Thank you.

810
00:29:18,667 --> 00:29:19,734
Excuse me just one moment.

811
00:29:22,467 --> 00:29:23,400
What are you doing?

812
00:29:23,533 --> 00:29:25,467
-Is this lemon?
-We had a deal.

813
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,000
You were going to wait outside
until I finished my meetings.

814
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:28,967
Now, why don't you just sit down

815
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,166
and...

816
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,567
try not to interrupt.

817
00:29:32,767 --> 00:29:33,667
I can do that.

818
00:29:36,433 --> 00:29:37,500
I'm so sorry, Sylvia.

819
00:29:37,633 --> 00:29:39,734
Um... right.

820
00:29:39,867 --> 00:29:42,133
So I would like a vanilla cake.

821
00:29:42,266 --> 00:29:43,200
All vanilla.

822
00:29:43,333 --> 00:29:44,166
Nothing but vanilla.

823
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,233
A lot of vanilla.

824
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,300
Did you say something?

825
00:29:47,433 --> 00:29:49,133
No.

826
00:29:49,266 --> 00:29:50,700
Sorry to interrupt.

827
00:29:50,834 --> 00:29:52,433
You were saying
how fond you were of vanilla.

828
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,066
[sighs]

829
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,867
I mean, imagine, if you will,

830
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,166
a world
where only vanilla exists--

831
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,467
no butterscotch, no coconut,

832
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,834
no rocky road.

833
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:07,233
I suspect in a vanilla world,
oceans wouldn't get crossed,

834
00:30:07,367 --> 00:30:08,800
mountains never climbed,

835
00:30:08,934 --> 00:30:11,500
civilizations never discovered.

836
00:30:11,633 --> 00:30:12,467
Perhaps I'm being dramatic.

837
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,600
Mm!

838
00:30:13,734 --> 00:30:17,834
This is not about Magellan
discovering a new world.

839
00:30:17,967 --> 00:30:20,066
This is about my wedding cake.

840
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,700
You're absolutely right.

841
00:30:21,834 --> 00:30:22,867
I apologize.

842
00:30:23,934 --> 00:30:24,767
I'm just gonna sit here.

843
00:30:31,033 --> 00:30:31,967
Um...

844
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:32,967
where were we?

845
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,300
Sugar petals.

846
00:30:34,433 --> 00:30:36,066
Right. Uh, sugar petals.

847
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,734
So, the, um--

848
00:30:37,867 --> 00:30:43,233
the floral-inspired decor
would...

849
00:30:43,367 --> 00:30:44,600
um...

850
00:30:47,133 --> 00:30:48,266
You think vanilla is dull?

851
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,734
I think vanilla is playing it
a little bit safe.

852
00:30:51,867 --> 00:30:53,667
And from my observation,

853
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,700
all the years
that I've known you, Elizabeth,

854
00:30:55,834 --> 00:30:56,700
you do tend to play it safe.

855
00:30:56,834 --> 00:30:59,233
Maybe it's because
you want people to think

856
00:30:59,367 --> 00:31:03,033
that you're a responsible,
practical, safe person,

857
00:31:03,166 --> 00:31:04,867
but, deep down,

858
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,233
I think you're actually
a Neapolitan ice-cream sundae,

859
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:11,300
with sprinkles,

860
00:31:11,433 --> 00:31:12,600
maybe even
a little cherry on top.

861
00:31:15,433 --> 00:31:19,100
If you'd just
let go once in a while,

862
00:31:19,233 --> 00:31:20,967
you might discover
that you're not vanilla--

863
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,266
not at all.

864
00:31:23,934 --> 00:31:25,100
Sylvia...

865
00:31:26,333 --> 00:31:27,600
let's go with the vanilla.

866
00:31:29,033 --> 00:31:30,233
You got it.

867
00:31:39,033 --> 00:31:40,166
You think I'm dull, don't you?

868
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,033
No. In fact,

869
00:31:44,166 --> 00:31:45,967
that's the opposite
of what I was trying to express.

870
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,033
Well, why don't you
just say it?

871
00:31:47,166 --> 00:31:48,300
I won't be angry.

872
00:31:48,433 --> 00:31:52,000
You think my life with George
is dull and uninteresting.

873
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:53,967
At least compared to your life.

874
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,133
Well...

875
00:31:56,266 --> 00:31:57,533
someone's gotta
hold down the fort

876
00:31:57,667 --> 00:31:59,333
so us crazies can act out.

877
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,133
Well, maybe...

878
00:32:05,066 --> 00:32:06,100
Nothing.

879
00:32:06,233 --> 00:32:06,934
No, go ahead.
You started.

880
00:32:07,066 --> 00:32:07,934
Maybe what?

881
00:32:08,066 --> 00:32:09,300
Maybe, sometimes,

882
00:32:09,433 --> 00:32:11,500
I get a bit sick
of holding down the fort.

883
00:32:13,667 --> 00:32:15,567
Maybe I don't wanna be
just vanilla.

884
00:32:17,066 --> 00:32:18,700
Maybe I wanna be...

885
00:32:18,834 --> 00:32:20,500
chocolate and strawberry, too.

886
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,533
Alright.

887
00:32:23,667 --> 00:32:24,467
[Elizabeth]
Wait, where are we going?

888
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,467
[David] You'll see.

889
00:32:28,567 --> 00:32:29,867
Hold on, Magellan.

890
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,133
You're about to discover
a whole new world.

891
00:32:33,266 --> 00:32:34,300
[bell clanging]

892
00:32:34,433 --> 00:32:36,133
[cheering]

893
00:32:36,266 --> 00:32:38,533
You've been here before, right?

894
00:32:38,667 --> 00:32:39,900
Once.

895
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:41,667
You grew up here

896
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,633
and you've only been

897
00:32:42,767 --> 00:32:44,433
to The Flying Otter Oyster Bar
one time?

898
00:32:44,567 --> 00:32:46,300
Well, I don't know, David.
I didn't plan it.

899
00:32:46,433 --> 00:32:47,433
Well, we're going to fix that.

900
00:32:47,567 --> 00:32:49,033
Sandy, my everything.

901
00:32:49,166 --> 00:32:50,667
Hey.

902
00:32:52,233 --> 00:32:53,233
Lizzie, Sandy.
Sandy, Lizzie.

903
00:32:54,567 --> 00:32:55,533
[women together] We've met.

904
00:32:55,667 --> 00:32:56,567
Enjoy.

905
00:32:58,467 --> 00:32:59,433
Okay.

906
00:32:59,567 --> 00:33:01,166
You're gonna love this.

907
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,533
We are going to finish
this entire thing.

908
00:33:03,667 --> 00:33:05,266
The bell's gonna ring,

909
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,767
and we're gonna have that pie.

910
00:33:09,367 --> 00:33:10,767
Come on.
I believe in you.

911
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,100
There it is.
Bottoms up.

912
00:33:18,333 --> 00:33:19,100

00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,800
Going to see movies in town.

1097
00:40:09,934 --> 00:40:11,834
And we just loved to go dancing.

1098
00:40:13,166 --> 00:40:14,066
Boy, oh, boy,

1099
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,333
we were something else
on that dance floor.

1100
00:40:16,467 --> 00:40:19,133
Every move perfectly in sync.

1101
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,200
People used to say

1102
00:40:22,333 --> 00:40:24,200
that Martin and I
were a match made in heaven.

1103
00:40:25,433 --> 00:40:26,900
So why didn't you marry him?

1104
00:40:28,233 --> 00:40:30,433
Blah.

1105
00:40:30,567 --> 00:40:34,000
Why would I want to marry
someone who is exactly like me?

1106
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:37,934
All right,

1107
00:40:38,066 --> 00:40:40,533
then how did you end up
marrying Grandpa Lou?

1108
00:40:40,667 --> 00:40:42,967
Well, you know,

1109
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,967
after we met,

1110
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,500
he really started
to grow on me.

1111
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:48,900
Little by little.

1112
00:40:50,433 --> 00:40:52,300
He challenged me.

1113
00:40:52,433 --> 00:40:53,800
And that was a good thing.

1114
00:40:56,734 --> 00:40:59,300
And with him,

1115
00:40:59,433 --> 00:41:01,100
I found
I could always be myself...

1116
00:41:02,667 --> 00:41:04,000
the real Vivien,

1117
00:41:04,133 --> 00:41:07,300
not to mention we had
this wonderful connection.

1118
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:13,100
We used to call it "that zing".

1119
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,533
"Zing"?

1120
00:41:15,667 --> 00:41:19,066
Well, it's just...

1121
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,600
a feeling.

1122
00:41:20,734 --> 00:41:22,800
You can't force zing.

1123
00:41:24,633 --> 00:41:26,266
And you can't deny it
if it's there.

1124
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,100
Right.

1125
00:41:29,233 --> 00:41:31,533
And even though
Lou didn't like to sail,

1126
00:41:31,667 --> 00:41:32,900
and he didn't like to dance...

1127
00:41:35,533 --> 00:41:39,700
every time that man
held me in his arms,

1128
00:41:39,834 --> 00:41:41,533
I would just
go weak in the knees.

1129
00:41:43,967 --> 00:41:45,834
Like jello.

1130
00:41:45,967 --> 00:41:47,066
Every single time.

1131
00:41:48,967 --> 00:41:50,433
I'm sure like you and David.

1132
00:41:51,867 --> 00:41:52,900
You mean like me and George?

1133
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,400
That's what I said.

1134
00:42:01,066 --> 00:42:04,633
[♪♪]

1135
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,333
Every time I come in here,
it reminds me of my dad.

1136
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,600
He used to read to us
from that chair right there.

1137
00:42:25,867 --> 00:42:27,066
One of my favorite
childhood memories.

1138
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,800
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

1139
00:42:28,934 --> 00:42:32,233
The best is when he read
"Robin Hood".

1140
00:42:32,367 --> 00:42:33,333
He did the greatest voice of--

1141
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:34,667
[together] Friar Tuck.

1142
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,834
That's right.

1143
00:42:37,433 --> 00:42:38,166
I loved the way
he did those voices.

1144
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:39,233
Me too.

1145
00:42:39,367 --> 00:42:41,066
Look at these places.

1146
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,900
China, India, Nepal.

1147
00:42:43,033 --> 00:42:44,333
It's all so beautiful.

1148
00:42:45,734 --> 00:42:47,100
So is that how you do it?

1149
00:42:48,967 --> 00:42:49,834
You just spin the globe,

1150
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:51,667
and point to a place,

1151
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,700
and that's how you choose
where to go next?

1152
00:42:55,033 --> 00:42:55,867
It's a good start, no?

1153
00:43:01,367 --> 00:43:02,333
The Himalayas.

1154
00:43:04,934 --> 00:43:07,500
I wonder if, when you're in
these faraway places,

1155
00:43:07,633 --> 00:43:09,066
if you ever feel like there's
a part of you that's missing?

1156
00:43:11,967 --> 00:43:13,667
Sometimes, when I'm on
the other side of the planet,

1157
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:17,200
I sleep and I do dream of...

1158
00:43:17,333 --> 00:43:18,367
being home.

1159
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,166
Sometimes, I wake up,

1160
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,133
and I long to be back
with the people I love,

1161
00:43:23,266 --> 00:43:25,433
the people I left behind.

1162
00:43:27,533 --> 00:43:28,667
That's why
you're so lucky, Lizzie.

1163
00:43:30,133 --> 00:43:31,166
I'm so lucky?

1164
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:32,333
Yes, you're very lucky.

1165
00:43:32,467 --> 00:43:33,800
Oh.

1166
00:43:33,934 --> 00:43:35,066
There is a part of me

1167
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,066
that wonders
what it would be like

1168
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,633
to be that important person...

1169
00:43:38,767 --> 00:43:40,500
for somebody else.

1170
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:42,867
And you have that.

1171
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,400
You're that missing piece

1172
00:43:45,533 --> 00:43:48,133
that makes
someone's heart whole,

1173
00:43:48,266 --> 00:43:49,433
like you said.

1174
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:58,066
The truth is, you can climb
the highest mountain...

1175
00:43:59,333 --> 00:44:02,367
and swim the widest river...

1176
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:03,934
and still never find that.

1177
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,133
Oh, my goodness.
It's still here.

1178
00:44:07,266 --> 00:44:09,266
What?

1179
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,467
You've got to come see this.

1180
00:44:16,266 --> 00:44:17,133
Do you remember this?

1181
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,266
[Elizabeth]
How did you find this?

1182
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,433
[David] I watched you
write that note

1183
00:44:24,567 --> 00:44:26,300
when you were 13...

1184
00:44:26,433 --> 00:44:27,300
right over there.

1185
00:44:28,734 --> 00:44:30,133
Then I watched you
stick it in this book.

1186
00:44:31,367 --> 00:44:32,467
Of course,
I had to come read it.

1187
00:44:35,333 --> 00:44:37,700
I wanted to go to Rome so bad.

1188
00:44:37,834 --> 00:44:39,767
[David] Mm-hmm.

1189
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:41,066
I thought
maybe we'd go as a family,

1190
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,266
but then my parents split up.

1191
00:44:43,834 --> 00:44:45,033
Look at all the places
I wanted to go.

1192
00:44:45,166 --> 00:44:47,133
Trevi Fountain.

1193
00:44:47,266 --> 00:44:48,467
The Colosseum.

1194
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,233
The Sistine Chapel.

1195
00:44:50,367 --> 00:44:51,233
Did you ever end up going?

1196
00:44:53,433 --> 00:44:54,433
No.

1197
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:55,967
No?

1198
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:56,934
Come on, Lizzie,

1199
00:44:57,066 --> 00:44:58,467
you've got to go--
what's stopping you?

1200
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,800
I just can't see that happening
anytime soon.

1201
00:45:04,967 --> 00:45:05,767
Maybe there's a piece
of your heart

1202
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:07,033
that's missing, too.

1203
00:45:09,767 --> 00:45:11,100
A piece of you
that's in this list right here,

1204
00:45:11,233 --> 00:45:13,133
that that girl wrote
all those years ago.

1205
00:45:14,333 --> 00:45:18,000
[♪♪]

1206
00:45:19,567 --> 00:45:20,667
I gotta call George.

1207
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,433
Yes, of course.
I'll leave you to it.

1208
00:45:23,567 --> 00:45:24,800
Say hello to the man for me.

1209
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:38,033
[♪♪]

1210
00:45:38,166 --> 00:45:39,467
[Louise] Where have you been?

1211
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,300
Inside with Elizabeth.

1212
00:45:41,433 --> 00:45:43,100
Sorry.
Lost track of time.

1213
00:45:43,233 --> 00:45:45,367
[Louise] That's nice.

1214
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:47,033
What's nice?

1215
00:45:47,166 --> 00:45:48,900
That you and Elizabeth
are finally friends.

1216
00:45:51,467 --> 00:45:52,400
You know,

1217
00:45:52,533 --> 00:45:54,834
I think you bring out
a different side of her.

1218
00:45:56,166 --> 00:45:57,266
Oh, yeah?
How so?

1219
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:58,433
I don't know.

1220
00:45:58,567 --> 00:46:02,433
I mean, when she's around you,
she's a lot lighter,

1221
00:46:02,567 --> 00:46:04,533
and she's less Elizabeth
and more Lizzie.

1222
00:46:06,133 --> 00:46:06,900
Yeah, she's pretty great.

1223
00:46:07,033 --> 00:46:08,166
I know.

1224
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:09,266
I've been telling you that
for years.

1225
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Well, don't you
just know everything?

1226
00:46:14,133 --> 00:46:15,367
Ha, ha.

1227
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:17,500
I bet you regret all those years

1228
00:46:17,633 --> 00:46:19,133
when you and Elizabeth
didn't get along.

1229
00:46:20,633 --> 00:46:22,066
Yeah, between her lists,

1230
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,667
and my dancing and carrying on,

1231
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,066
we...

1232
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,667
thoroughly annoyed each other,

1233
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:30,200
but we're all adults now,
we can move on from that.

1234
00:46:30,333 --> 00:46:31,400
Well, good.

1235
00:46:32,633 --> 00:46:33,734
I guess you and Elizabeth

1236
00:46:33,867 --> 00:46:34,734
have found that thing

1237
00:46:34,867 --> 00:46:36,233
that Grandma Vivien
always talks about--

1238
00:46:36,367 --> 00:46:37,400
you know...

1239
00:46:37,533 --> 00:46:38,433
that "zing".

1240
00:46:41,734 --> 00:46:43,633
Grandma was talking about
what she had with Grandpa Lou.

1241
00:46:44,867 --> 00:46:47,200
I don't got a zing with Lizzie.
I got a zing with nobody.

1242
00:46:47,333 --> 00:46:48,266
I'm zing-less.

1243
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,367
Come on.

1244
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:51,934
George and Lizzie...

1245
00:46:52,066 --> 00:46:53,100
they got a zing.

1246
00:46:55,333 --> 00:46:56,700
Those two are perfect
for each other.

1247
00:46:58,533 --> 00:46:59,633
It's just
an off-the-charts zing.

1248
00:47:05,567 --> 00:47:09,934
[♪♪]

1249
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,200
[knocking]

1250
00:47:20,467 --> 00:47:21,500
Hi, Eugene.

1251
00:47:21,633 --> 00:47:22,500
You're working late.

1252
00:47:22,633 --> 00:47:23,667
I don't mind.

1253
00:47:25,734 --> 00:47:27,433
Louise, Eugene is looking tired.

1254
00:47:28,567 --> 00:47:29,467
Perhaps he'd like some coffee?

1255
00:47:30,767 --> 00:47:32,100
Oh, yeah.
We just made a fresh pot.

1256
00:47:32,233 --> 00:47:33,100
Would you like some?

1257
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,667
I'd love some.
Thanks.

1258
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:37,700
Cream? Sugar?

1259
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:40,166
-Black is fine.
-Okay.

1260
00:47:41,734 --> 00:47:42,834
Have you eaten
much today, Eugene?

1261
00:47:44,467 --> 00:47:45,433
Not much.

1262
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,166
[Elizabeth] Ahem.

1263
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:49,600
Oh, we have some pie.
Would you like a piece?

1264
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:51,500
I'd love one.

1265
00:47:51,633 --> 00:47:52,800
Okay.

1266
00:47:54,734 --> 00:47:55,633
It's apple.

1267
00:47:57,867 --> 00:47:58,834
Oh, right.

1268
00:47:58,967 --> 00:47:59,967
There you go.

1269
00:48:05,867 --> 00:48:06,734
You made this?

1270
00:48:06,867 --> 00:48:08,033
Oh, no, no, no.

1271
00:48:08,166 --> 00:48:09,166
That was all Louise.

1272
00:48:10,834 --> 00:48:12,166
You like it?

1273
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:14,166
I think it's the best pie
I've ever eaten.

is ridiculous?

that you're using
to make another list

1386

so that people
can buy you presents,

1387

of their hearts,

You didn't care about
that ring, did you?

01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:09,900
With George.

1632
01:04:11,567 --> 01:04:12,467
Sure.

1633
01:04:14,033 --> 01:04:16,133
We need to take some time away
from the practice,

1634
01:04:16,266 --> 01:04:17,367
and...

1635
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:18,600
go to Rome.

1636
01:04:21,834 --> 01:04:23,900
You can picture George
at the Colosseum, right?

1637
01:04:25,066 --> 01:04:25,967
Of course.

1638
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:26,967
I can picture that.

1639
01:04:28,667 --> 01:04:29,600
Great!

1640
01:04:31,266 --> 01:04:33,100
That's what
I'm going to do, then.

1641
01:04:33,233 --> 01:04:34,533
As soon as George gets here,

1642
01:04:34,667 --> 01:04:36,633
I'm going to tell him
about our new plan.

1643
01:04:36,767 --> 01:04:37,834
Alright.

1644
01:04:39,734 --> 01:04:40,867
But first I'm going
to climb this ladder.

1645
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,233
Right.

1646
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:53,934
Take your time.

1647
01:04:54,066 --> 01:04:56,834
You got it.
Stay close.

1648
01:05:03,734 --> 01:05:04,633
You got it.

1649
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:06,266
A little further.

1650
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:07,200
[Elizabeth] Oh, my goodness.

1651
01:05:07,333 --> 01:05:08,467
Pull yourself over.

1652
01:05:11,333 --> 01:05:14,367
[♪♪]

1653
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:19,000
How's the view?

1654
01:05:23,834 --> 01:05:24,967
Amazing.

1655
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:29,467
[♪♪]

1656
01:05:35,667 --> 01:05:36,533
-Oh!
-Oh!

1657
01:05:36,667 --> 01:05:37,533
Dr. Belling.

1658
01:05:37,667 --> 01:05:39,533
Denise.

1659
01:05:40,667 --> 01:05:41,934
Your sister called.

1660
01:05:42,066 --> 01:05:43,467
The Echo Island Bridge
is reopening tomorrow.

1661
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:45,100
Oh! That's good news.

1662
01:05:45,233 --> 01:05:46,500
Yeah.

1663
01:05:47,667 --> 01:05:48,533
Thank you, Denise.

1664
01:05:48,667 --> 01:05:50,100
For what?

1665
01:05:50,233 --> 01:05:52,300
Thank you for always
putting in extra hours,

1666
01:05:52,433 --> 01:05:53,333
even when not asked.

1667
01:05:53,467 --> 01:05:55,533
Oh, well, it's my pleasure.

1668
01:05:55,667 --> 01:05:56,500
Well, I imagine

1669
01:05:56,633 --> 01:05:57,600
there's probably
a thousand other places

1670
01:05:57,734 --> 01:05:58,767
you'd rather be than here.

1671
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:00,433
Not really.

1672
01:06:00,567 --> 01:06:02,333
I really enjoy my job,

1673
01:06:02,467 --> 01:06:06,200
so, truthfully,
there's no place I'd rather be.

1674
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:11,867
Uh-huh.

1675
01:06:20,367 --> 01:06:23,100
So what is the sheriff doing?

1676
01:06:23,233 --> 01:06:24,734
He's trying to catch
the bad guys.

1677
01:06:24,867 --> 01:06:26,567
Spoiler, he always does.

1678
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:27,900
Hmm, clever.

1679
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:30,567
You don't like this movie,
do you?

1680
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:31,667
Shh.

1681
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:33,033
You can admit it.

1682
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:35,400
Hey.

1683
01:06:35,533 --> 01:06:36,433
I spoke to Bob Dooley today.

1684
01:06:36,567 --> 01:06:38,600
[together] Uh-huh?

1685
01:06:38,734 --> 01:06:39,934
And the bridge
is reopening in the morning.

1686
01:06:40,066 --> 01:06:41,867
[together] Mm-hmm.

1687
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,700
So George'll be back soon.

1688
01:06:45,333 --> 01:06:47,033
[power cutting out]

1689
01:06:47,166 --> 01:06:48,400
[David] Nice.

1690
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:55,567
So will you be leaving
once the bridge reopens?

1691
01:06:55,700 --> 01:06:57,033
[David] No, no, no.

1692
01:06:57,166 --> 01:06:59,233
I've gotta stay for
the engagement party, right?

1693
01:07:02,867 --> 01:07:05,233
Alright, I've told her to change
this thing a million times, Mom.

1694
01:07:05,367 --> 01:07:09,266
Wow, look at all these boxes.

1695
01:07:10,633 --> 01:07:13,266
Geez Louise, Louise,
that's a lot of them.

1696
01:07:15,433 --> 01:07:16,500
Here's one of yours.

1697
01:07:21,033 --> 01:07:21,934
What's in here?

1698
01:07:27,533 --> 01:07:33,266
Oh, that is a lot of souvenirs
and travel books.

1699
01:07:35,266 --> 01:07:36,066
Can I see that book, please?

1700
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:37,333
Sure.

1701
01:07:37,467 --> 01:07:38,867
Thank you.

1702
01:07:40,867 --> 01:07:42,333
So have you really been
to all these places?

1703
01:07:45,066 --> 01:07:47,233
Yeah. Yeah, pretty much.

1704
01:07:47,367 --> 01:07:49,367
London, Amsterdam...

1705
01:07:52,633 --> 01:07:54,600
Paris.

1706
01:07:54,734 --> 01:07:55,567
After you and George
go to Rome,

1707
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:56,834
you've gotta stop in Paris.

1708
01:07:56,967 --> 01:07:58,166
Everybody's gotta see
Paris once.

1709
01:07:59,533 --> 01:08:01,533
Walk along the Seine River.

1710
01:08:01,667 --> 01:08:03,667
Wander the streets of Monmarte.

1711
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:05,800
You've gotta stop
at this little place

1712
01:08:05,934 --> 01:08:07,000
in the 5th arrondissement

1713
01:08:07,133 --> 01:08:10,367
that has the best profiteroles
that you will ever have.

1714
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:11,700
They just melt in your mouth.

1715
01:08:11,834 --> 01:08:16,133
What if George doesn't want
to go to Paris?

1716
01:08:16,266 --> 01:08:18,000
I mean, Lizzie, you talk
a lot about George's plan

1717
01:08:18,133 --> 01:08:18,900
and what he wants,

1718
01:08:19,033 --> 01:08:20,400
but...

1719
01:08:20,533 --> 01:08:22,233
I know George would want to do
what you want to do, too.

1720
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:25,166
So what do you want?

1721
01:08:28,867 --> 01:08:29,867
I want to go to Paris.

1722
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:32,166
Then you should go to Paris.

1723
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:35,367
What will people think?

1724
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:37,967
Lizzie, sometimes,
the people around you

1725
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:39,333
aren't going
to understand your journey.

1726
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:42,033
That's okay.
They don't need to.

1727
01:08:43,633 --> 01:08:44,767
It's not for them.

1728
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,734
Lizzie, maybe nobody's
told you this before,

1729
01:08:48,867 --> 01:08:51,367
but it's okay...

1730
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:53,600
for you to chase
your own happiness.

1731
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:01,734
[power surges on]

1732
01:09:05,266 --> 01:09:06,300
Et voilà.

1733
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:13,066
Bonne nuit.

1734
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:14,600
Goodnight.

1735
01:09:27,767 --> 01:09:31,166
[♪♪]

1736
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:45,934
[♪♪]

1737
01:09:59,967 --> 01:10:00,800
[George] Elizabeth!

1738
01:10:00,934 --> 01:10:02,266
George.

1739
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:03,300
You're back!

1740
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:08,166
Are you alright?

1741
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:09,934
Yes. Yes.

1742
01:10:10,066 --> 01:10:10,900
I was just about
to go for a walk.

1743
01:10:11,033 --> 01:10:11,800
Do you want to join me?

1744
01:10:11,934 --> 01:10:12,867
Sure.

1745
01:10:14,767 --> 01:10:16,433
Oh, I hope you don't mind,

1746
01:10:16,567 --> 01:10:19,433
I registered us for a seminar
in September at the University.

1747
01:10:19,567 --> 01:10:21,934
Fixed metallic replacements
versus dental implants.

1748
01:10:22,066 --> 01:10:23,767
I couldn't resist.

1749
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:25,100
It sounded so fun.

1750
01:10:25,233 --> 01:10:26,200
Yeah, sure, George.
Whatever you want.

1751
01:10:30,033 --> 01:10:32,467
Actually...

1752
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:33,633
while you were gone,
I did some thinking,

1753
01:10:33,767 --> 01:10:35,100
and, um...

1754
01:10:35,233 --> 01:10:37,834
I think I've come up
with a pretty fun plan for us.

1755
01:10:37,967 --> 01:10:39,667
Another seminar?

1756
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:40,867
Not exactly.

1757
01:10:42,367 --> 01:10:43,800
I think that we should
put things on hold

1758
01:10:43,934 --> 01:10:45,266
for a couple of months

1759
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:47,100
and travel the world.

1760
01:10:48,533 --> 01:10:50,100
Elizabeth, I already said

1761
01:10:50,233 --> 01:10:51,767
I do not want
to go to South America.

1762
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:55,667
I have no interest
in ziplining across the Andes.

1763
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:56,633
And this is certainly
not the time

1764
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:57,934
to leave our practice.

1765
01:10:58,066 --> 01:10:59,633
Okay, just hear me out, George.

1766
01:11:00,967 --> 01:11:02,567
This could actually be

1767
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:04,333
the perfect time for us
to do something like this.

1768
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:06,834
We don't have kids,

1769
01:11:06,967 --> 01:11:09,200
we haven't bought a house yet.

1770
01:11:09,333 --> 01:11:10,700
It could be
the adventure of a lifetime.

1771
01:11:12,333 --> 01:11:13,734
And we don't have to go
to South America.

1772
01:11:13,867 --> 01:11:14,834
We could...

1773
01:11:14,967 --> 01:11:16,400
We could go to Rome.

1774
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:18,700
Did I ever tell you

1775
01:11:18,834 --> 01:11:20,867
how much I've always wanted
to see the Coliseum?

1776
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,834
And then we could go to Paris
and eat profiteroles.

1777
01:11:25,967 --> 01:11:27,800
Do I need to remind you

1778
01:11:27,934 --> 01:11:29,500
that this fall
we have a dental convention,

1779
01:11:29,633 --> 01:11:31,033
three seminars, two lectures,

1780
01:11:31,166 --> 01:11:32,800
and not to mention our patients,

1781
01:11:32,934 --> 01:11:33,800
who, I assure you,

1782
01:11:33,934 --> 01:11:35,100
will not be very happy

1783
01:11:35,233 --> 01:11:36,967
to know that their dentists
are galavanting across Europe.

1784
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:38,734
Sure. Sure.

1785
01:11:38,867 --> 01:11:39,834
You're right.

1786
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:41,934
Just a crazy idea.

1787
01:11:45,433 --> 01:11:46,300
Maybe someday we can go?

1788
01:11:46,433 --> 01:11:49,567
Maybe someday,

1789
01:11:49,700 --> 01:11:52,667
when we're very old
and very grey,

1790
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:53,700
we'll go to Paris.

1791
01:11:56,934 --> 01:11:57,734
Dance with me.

1792
01:11:57,867 --> 01:11:58,700
What?

1793
01:11:58,834 --> 01:12:00,266
I want to dance with you.

1794

Now?

1795
01:12:01,333 --> 01:12:04,300
Yes. Now.

1796
01:12:06,934 --> 01:12:09,133
Dance? Huh.

01:23:34,433 --> 01:23:36,000
I was 13 years old
when I wrote that note.

1994
01:23:39,300 --> 01:23:40,834
It was right after I read yours.

1995
01:23:42,266 --> 01:23:44,767
I put it in that book
right there,

1996
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:46,533
hoping that one day
maybe you would find it.

1997
01:23:49,367 --> 01:23:50,967
But you never did.

1998
01:23:53,266 --> 01:23:54,834
Not the smartest idea
of all time, but...

1999
01:23:56,633 --> 01:23:57,533
it was okay...

2000
01:24:00,467 --> 01:24:01,367
because you were happy.

2001
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:07,000
You asked me once
if I'd ever been in love.

2002
01:24:10,100 --> 01:24:11,367
The answer is, just once.

2003
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:15,433
And I never stopped.

2004
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:18,834
For me, it's always been you.

2005
01:24:22,467 --> 01:24:25,834
I loved you yesterday,

2006
01:24:25,967 --> 01:24:27,600
I love you today...

2007
01:24:28,867 --> 01:24:30,100
I'll love you tomorrow.

2008
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:36,300
[♪♪]

2009
01:24:36,433 --> 01:24:37,533
Dance with me.

2010
01:24:37,667 --> 01:24:42,266
[♪♪]

2011
01:24:58,533 --> 01:25:01,800
I thought I might get a kiss
with that line.

2012
01:25:01,934 --> 01:25:03,600
Shh!

2013
01:25:03,734 --> 01:25:09,433
[♪♪]

2014
01:25:34,734 --> 01:25:35,900
Sorry, hold on.

2015
01:25:36,033 --> 01:25:37,467
He's going to propose.

2016
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:38,800
Just watch.

2017
01:25:40,767 --> 01:25:42,300
I thought you didn't like
these dating shows.

2018
01:25:42,433 --> 01:25:44,467
Well, you know...

2019
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:47,166
Love and stuff.

2020
01:25:52,900 --> 01:25:56,567
