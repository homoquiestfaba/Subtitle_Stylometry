2
00:04:07,267 --> 00:04:08,938
I do not fear you,
ugly thing.

3
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:11,691
My heart is pure
as a fresh water spring.

4
00:04:14,195 --> 00:04:17,578
The Silver Knight Gothic was standing,
facing the terrible skeleton dragon.

5
00:04:17,678 --> 00:04:20,817
That stared at him,
with his big, ugly empty eyes.

6
00:04:21,304 --> 00:04:24,851
With my silver daggers
I shall lop off your head.

7
00:04:24,852 --> 00:04:25,852
Jus ...

8
00:04:26,047 --> 00:04:28,644
Justice will be done only
when you are dead.

9
00:04:32,686 --> 00:04:35,634
The terrible skeleton dragon 
stumbled and staggered

10
00:04:35,756 --> 00:04:39,007
and collapsed with an agonizing groan,
that sent shivers down the spine.

11
00:04:42,352 --> 00:04:46,771
The frail King emerged from his hiding place
to congratulate the noble Silver Knight Gothic.

12
00:04:47,152 --> 00:04:49,513
Enough you little pest.
Clean everything up.

13
00:04:49,896 --> 00:04:52,540
But my lord Gildas,
I am playing the "Silver Knight Gothic."

14
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:55,947
Your uncle, the good lord Arnold,
awaits us for supper.

15
00:05:13,835 --> 00:05:15,935
Still no sign of them, my good lord?

16
00:05:16,945 --> 00:05:19,301
Nothing, Gildas, nothing at all.

17
00:05:19,607 --> 00:05:26,006
I can no longer see, but I am absolutely certain
 my faithful knights will never return.

18
00:05:28,526 --> 00:05:31,645
With all due respect, my lord,
you have allowed dispair to overcome you ...

19
00:05:31,628 --> 00:05:33,804
Do you want me to dance a Jig?

20
00:05:35,429 --> 00:05:36,978
Come, come now mi'lord ...

21
00:05:37,363 --> 00:05:42,826
Where are those days of yore when my
castle did shine in all its glory?

22
00:05:44,905 --> 00:05:48,331
Where are my men, my guards,
my five players?

23
00:05:49,609 --> 00:05:51,893
Alas they have all fled, my good lord.

24
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:55,087
I may be blind, Gildas,
but I am nobodys fool.

25
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:59,220
It is quite clear that no one wishes to
remain in this fortress.

26
00:06:01,034 --> 00:06:04,770
Who would want to live here,
in fear of the World Gobbler.

27
00:06:04,771 --> 00:06:09,014
Speaking of which, it is night time to send
your niece to a safe haven.

28
00:06:09,015 --> 00:06:11,378
To the convent of the crooked
tooth Sisters.

29
00:06:12,694 --> 00:06:15,817
 Ahh Gildas, if only I'dve had a nephew ...

30
00:06:17,033 --> 00:06:20,432
I could have taught him the basic principles
of Dragon hunting.

31
00:06:20,433 --> 00:06:23,336
Oh, yes, please Uncle, that would be so darn neat.

32
00:06:23,337 --> 00:06:28,229
It's not that I would rather have you be a boy,
my little girl, but the fact is you are not one.

33
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:33,370
Hunting just isn't suitable for little girls.

34
00:06:43,045 --> 00:06:44,577
It's Granion of Bismuth, my uncle.

35
00:06:47,863 --> 00:06:48,912
Granion ...

36
00:06:49,383 --> 00:06:50,231
You're alive!

37
00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:54,917
And the World Gobbler,
have you seen him, have you slain him?

38
00:07:00,806 --> 00:07:04,020
Cease your stupid groaning!
I'll take you late.


39
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,545
Now where are my other loyal knights?

40
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:10,485
With all due respect, my lord, our faithful
Granion is but a pile of ashes.

41
00:07:16,719 --> 00:07:20,099
- The Smoldering Knights ...
- Another sign, my lord.

42
00:07:20,721 --> 00:07:23,537
Raise the Drawbridge, 
lower the Portcullis.

43
00:07:23,538 --> 00:07:27,526
- We've got to get a bigger Knight.
- You, go pack your bags, you're going to the crooked tooth ...

44
00:07:28,589 --> 00:07:31,908
Lock all the doors,
and bring me my battleaxe and sword.

45
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:33,209
Gildas!

46
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:41,592
We've got to get the Silver Knight Gothic.

47
00:08:13,607 --> 00:08:17,458
The tail Lian-chu, the tail. Teach him a lesson.
You hear me? Go on!

48
00:08:17,559 --> 00:08:19,536
Hit him in the tail!
Go! Go!

49
00:08:39,406 --> 00:08:41,335
On your feet.
Keep your guard up.

50
00:08:45,406 --> 00:08:48,335
And don't let him barf on you.

51
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:55,902
Victory.

52
00:10:07,202 --> 00:10:08,874
Okay, fun's over guys.

53
00:10:14,773 --> 00:10:17,237
Let's see, here we go;
Article 3, clause 2: states

54
00:10:17,238 --> 00:10:20,530
Upon receipt of the slain Momularis,
 Fat John of Wickashire shall 

55
00:10:20,591 --> 00:10:23,897
pay the measly sum of 24 Guinneas
to the valerous dragon hunters.

56
00:10:23,897 --> 00:10:27,096
I do not see any hunters.
All I see is a bevy of clowns.

57
00:10:27,497 --> 00:10:28,930
Walking disaster.

58
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:33,988
Look what your bonehead there did to my cabbage
patch with his goofball antics.

59
00:10:35,597 --> 00:10:39,691
Fat John of Wickashire, look at me.
Isn't that your x there at the bottom of the contract?

60
00:10:39,724 --> 00:10:43,377
Enough said river rat,
you're gettin' diddly squat.

61
00:10:43,585 --> 00:10:47,098
Do you want to get my muscle bulging
buddy all riled up, is that what you want?

62
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:49,587
Move out of my fields.

63
00:10:49,821 --> 00:10:51,787
And take the clown with you.

64
00:10:55,342 --> 00:10:57,347
Oooh, the mutt wants his doggy food huh?

65
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:12,347
Dear me.

66
00:11:12,382 --> 00:11:14,113
Great, I just tore my tights.

67
00:11:24,638 --> 00:11:26,722
What's the matter Gwizdo, are you mad?

68
00:11:27,298 --> 00:11:30,940
You think, that for once
you could take your job seriously?

69
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:32,964
It is always the same old circus, Lian-chu.

70
00:11:32,965 --> 00:11:35,965
All you do is clown around for the peanut gallery.

71
00:11:36,294 --> 00:11:37,731
But I don't do it on purpose.

72
00:11:37,732 --> 00:11:41,327
And it's a blimey good thing too ... 
Why, praytell, do you think these hicks never pay?

73
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:43,203
Because they've got no money?

74
00:11:44,464 --> 00:11:47,006
No! They rip us off
because you're not credible.

75
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,055
What does credible mean?
- I do not know ...

76
00:11:50,056 --> 00:11:51,767
Take Hector here for example.

77
00:11:52,476 --> 00:11:55,526
Hector, with his big fangs and all that fur,
well, he's credible.

78
00:11:55,527 --> 00:11:58,202
And that's why the hicks are scared of him.
You get it?

79
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:01,736
You don't get it ...

80
00:12:01,886 --> 00:12:05,508
Look, a dragon hunter who's credible
makes the whole earth shake when he walks.

81
00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:07,509
Right? Like ... 
Boom, Boom ...

82
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:15,183
And if he has to,
he smacks his debtors a couple of times.

83
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:18,062
Fork over the money!
Get the picture?

84
00:12:18,508 --> 00:12:20,794
Hitting customers,
that's being credible?

85
00:12:21,829 --> 00:12:23,017
Another example ...

86
00:12:23,412 --> 00:12:26,239
Do you think it's credible a dragon hunter
who likes to knit?

87
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,453
But I tore a hole in my ...

88
00:12:27,454 --> 00:12:31,315
You got Mandular boogers on the brain or what?
You knucklehead, knitting is something old ladies do.

89
00:12:34,231 --> 00:12:35,728
It was my mother who taught me.

90
00:14:02,431 --> 00:14:05,428
Look, I'm sorry, I did'nt really mean what I said about knitting

91
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:08,883
If you want a more credible friend,
why don't you go look for one?

92
00:14:08,884 --> 00:14:11,653
Do not be ridiculous, I could never
find a better friend than you.

93
00:14:11,966 --> 00:14:14,721
- You're just saying that so I won't be angry.
- Stop it.

94
00:14:14,722 --> 00:14:18,582
Who do you want me to hire as a partner?
Fat John of Wickashire?

95
00:14:22,045 --> 00:14:24,601
No way, we're a real team, 
me and you.

96
00:14:27,319 --> 00:14:30,404
Yeah, Hector.
The three of us.

97
00:14:33,325 --> 00:14:36,670
Say Gwizdo, you think we'll
have our little farm someday?

98
00:14:36,471 --> 00:14:39,006
Of course we will, you'll see.

99
00:14:38,807 --> 00:14:43,960
A quiet little house on the water.
And we'll have chickens, cows, pigs ...

100
00:14:43,706 --> 00:14:44,935
And we can have sheep.

101
00:14:46,644 --> 00:14:47,317
For the wool.

102
00:14:47,317 --> 00:14:51,070
Yeah, right, and you'll knit me a 
shawl and wollen underwear for the winter.

103
00:14:53,007 --> 00:14:53,737
What?

104
00:14:56,285 --> 00:14:58,427
- Electric Dragons.
- This might make some quick cash.

105
00:15:01,956 --> 00:15:03,978
Lian-chu, wait for me!

106
00:16:39,754 --> 00:16:41,428
Whoa! 
Silver Knight Gothic.

107
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,648
Uhm, no, it's me ... Lian-chu.

108
00:16:45,652 --> 00:16:47,195
You just saved my life, my ...

109
00:16:54,074 --> 00:16:57,178
Lordy leapin lizards,
two grilled jimbobs for the price of one.

110
00:16:57,179 --> 00:17:00,116
Well, when I say price, 
it's just my way of talking, k?

111
00:17:01,677 --> 00:17:05,544
Now we got two jimbob dragons,  night terror ...
30 Guineas are payable on delivery.

112
00:17:05,545 --> 00:17:06,941
Got the money on you, kid?

113
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,914
- Umm, no.
- Figures.

114
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:11,543
But of course your daddys got money, right?
Where are your parents?

115
00:17:11,683 --> 00:17:12,887
They're dead, mister.

116
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:15,170
Ahh, What misfortune ...

117
00:17:15,171 --> 00:17:16,904
Once again we work for peanuts!

118
00:17:16,905 --> 00:17:19,740
What you been doing in the woods at night,
without a Guinea in your pocket?

119
00:17:19,741 --> 00:17:23,827
Uuh I'm looking for a noble knights
for my uncle, who is very, very rich.

120
00:17:24,113 --> 00:17:26,217
Wait a minute, very, very rich?

121
00:17:26,218 --> 00:17:29,116
You are real knights,
aren't you, my lord?

122
00:17:31,671 --> 00:17:34,618
The knight Lian-chu was hiding
behind the village gates.

123
00:17:34,619 --> 00:17:37,937
The sun was up, bloodthirsty
dragons were attacking from all sides,

124
00:17:37,938 --> 00:17:39,906
The Knight Lian-chu was alone,
you see?

125
00:17:39,907 --> 00:17:41,801
- Alone against all odds.
- And then?

126
00:17:41,836 --> 00:17:45,158
And then, Knight Lian-chu grabs
onto a roof by the tips of his teeth.

127
00:17:45,159 --> 00:17:46,577
- By his teeth?
- Yeah!

128
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:48,881
And he leaps above the horde holloring ...

129
00:17:50,315 --> 00:17:52,571
And after that, after that, my lord?

130
00:17:52,606 --> 00:17:54,988
After that, Knight
Lian-chu jumps into the crowd,

131
00:17:54,989 --> 00:17:57,227
A smack here -
and a whack there.

132
00:17:57,767 --> 00:18:00,561
Wham bam thank you ma'am,
he ducks, a sword in each hand.

133
00:18:00,562 --> 00:18:04,591
And he sends them all flying with a kick to the butt,
a real massacre.

134
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,503
-Wow                    
- They took about a whole weekto clear the village.

135
00:18:08,082 --> 00:18:10,162
Whoa, that's ... unreal.

136
00:18:14,656 --> 00:18:17,842
Almost as fabulous as
Silver Knight Gothic.

137
00:18:18,216 --> 00:18:21,419
- Eh, What? Competition?
- Silver Knight Gothic.

138
00:18:21,671 --> 00:18:25,053
The hero of legends.
He also slaps around dragons.

139
00:18:25,054 --> 00:18:27,750
With strength, courage and generous spirit.

140
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:28,504
Oh yeah?

141
00:18:28,985 --> 00:18:31,589
Well, its kind of like that,
except for the generous part.

142
00:18:31,767 --> 00:18:34,458
One shouldn't believe everything you
read in fairy tales, right kid?

143
00:18:34,509 --> 00:18:35,955
You see, were more of a ...

144
00:18:36,756 --> 00:18:37,961
Wandering Knights.

145
00:18:39,171 --> 00:18:42,337
In any case, Uncle Arnold
is going to be happy to see you.

146
00:18:54,612 --> 00:18:56,421
Real big.

147
00:19:01,798 --> 00:19:04,060
I'm going to have to be darn credible now.

148
00:19:06,047 --> 00:19:08,209
My lords and ladies ...

149
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:11,043
How ya doin? Put a smile and
open up your bulging purses.

150
00:19:11,044 --> 00:19:14,459
Sir Gwizdo and Knight Lian-chu,
the greatest dragon hunters of ...

151
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,838
Who dares to disturb me
during my CLISTER.

152
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:20,527
With all due respect my lord, it is two
miserable louts and your niece.

153
00:19:20,528 --> 00:19:21,926
- Not at all.
- Zoé.

154
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:24,529
They are wandering knights, uncle.
They just saved my life.

155
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,970
Go to your room,
you little runaway.

156
00:19:26,971 --> 00:19:27,971
Uncle ...

157
00:19:27,972 --> 00:19:29,783
Tomorrow it's off to the crooked tooth..

158
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:40,530
You, what feats have you done?
besides putting up with my niece?

159
00:19:40,758 --> 00:19:44,745
Eh, us? well, uh, The noble knight
Lian-chu is famous in many a land,

160
00:19:44,745 --> 00:19:47,257
and his fearless feats have
inspired so many before him

161
00:19:47,257 --> 00:19:49,204
- that the ...
- Spare me the folklore.

162
00:19:49,205 --> 00:19:51,260
Warrior, take a step forward.

163
00:19:57,432 --> 00:19:59,152
He's got muscles ...

164
00:19:59,152 --> 00:20:01,513
and, uh, raw power!

165
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:04,771
Yes, the attributes
of a true warrior.

166
00:20:04,772 --> 00:20:07,156
Your Highness, if you please,
they are but ...

167
00:20:07,157 --> 00:20:08,530
Shut up, Gildas.

168
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:12,029
Lets roll son,
I have a mission for you.

169
00:20:46,714 --> 00:20:51,694
Every twenty seasons,
the most terrifying dragon alive wakes up,

170
00:20:51,695 --> 00:20:55,063
and leaves his lair
at the far end of the world.

171
00:20:55,064 --> 00:21:00,395
When he comes, he devours entire regions,
burns villages by the hundreds ...

172
00:21:00,396 --> 00:21:02,360
swallows fortresses whole,

173
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:07,076
before returning to his lair,
leaving only ashes behind.

174
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:08,077
Gildas!

175
00:21:13,999 --> 00:21:18,135
I have inscribed on this calendar
all of the signs of his awakening.

176
00:21:18,136 --> 00:21:20,998
Look, the Crenelations collapse.

177
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,507
The smoldering Knights.

178
00:21:24,328 --> 00:21:25,571
The red cloud.

179
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:28,191
the bridges sailing away.

180
00:21:28,593 --> 00:21:30,633
The sinking villages.

181
00:21:30,634 --> 00:21:32,668
And talking animals.

182
00:21:35,049 --> 00:21:38,121
When all of these signs have appeared,
my boy,

183
00:21:38,122 --> 00:21:42,106
He will have returned ...
the Devourer of Life.

184
00:21:44,096 --> 00:21:46,022
The World Gobbler.

185
00:21:47,524 --> 00:21:49,465
I have seen him son.

186
00:21:49,466 --> 00:21:52,800
I once lifted my sword before him.

187
00:21:52,801 --> 00:21:58,332
And the mere sight of his fiery gaze
drove my own eyes back into my skull.

188
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,520
Since then, all I can see
is a dead grey landscape

189
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:09,150
a terrible place where there is no life,
and no joy.

190
00:22:13,438 --> 00:22:15,742
What is that little tree there,
next to the dragon?

191
00:22:16,249 --> 00:22:18,523
That is for scale dear Knight.

192
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:23,510
Go to his kingdom, enter his lair,

193
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:26,054
far off in the west,
beyond the end of the world ...

194
00:22:26,055 --> 00:22:28,600
and strike him while he sleeps.

195
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:30,783
Before its too late.

196
00:22:30,784 --> 00:22:33,454
Yeah, yeah, yeah ...
but no.

197
00:22:33,455 --> 00:22:36,579
It is a cruel blow, but uh look at that,
were all booked up.

198
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:39,592
Strike him dead and the world will be saved.

199
00:22:39,593 --> 00:22:42,004
Lian-chu, say goodbye,
were disturbing the man.

200
00:22:42,005 --> 00:22:44,907
My health and sight will return.

201
00:22:45,408 --> 00:22:48,527
And I will cover you in gold.

202
00:22:59,784 --> 00:23:03,742
Dear client, if you can make room for
his head in your museum of horrors.

203
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,482
But first let me show you our 
standard contract.

204
00:23:06,483 --> 00:23:08,126
Special little advance for
travel expenses.

205
00:23:08,127 --> 00:23:09,962
And since were among
noble knights ...

206
00:23:09,963 --> 00:23:13,309
A large purse of gold should 
do the trick nicely.

207
00:23:13,407 --> 00:23:15,318
Modern methods, why not?

208
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:16,319
Gildas!

209
00:23:22,193 --> 00:23:25,729
Yah, just put an X there, here, here and there.

210
00:23:26,437 --> 00:23:28,410
Roll, roll, roll.

211
00:23:36,411 --> 00:23:37,969
The red cloud, my lord.

212
00:23:45,887 --> 00:23:48,689
Saddle up my good brave Knights.

213
00:23:50,961 --> 00:23:53,933
Keep heading west my lords,
until the end of the world.

214
00:23:53,934 --> 00:23:57,080
Yes, for sure, for sure, old man. Of course Gildas.
Say hi to the misses will ya?

215
00:24:17,905 --> 00:24:19,463
Yes, yes, Ha, ha ha!

216
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:22,521
Yes! Yes! Who who who!

217
00:24:39,017 --> 00:24:40,064
Where you going?

218
00:24:40,368 --> 00:24:44,240
Coiff a cold one buddy, is not every day that
we get to rip off a blind of geezer.

219
00:24:44,507 --> 00:24:46,118
That's not the way
to the end of the world.

220
00:24:46,817 --> 00:24:50,536
Lian-chu, don't you understand, 
who cares about their end of the world?

221
00:24:50,537 --> 00:24:52,548
We are rich.
You know what this is?

222
00:24:52,549 --> 00:24:55,249
- An advance?
- This is our little farm, buddy.

223
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:57,850
The one of our comfy little dreams,
with sheep everywhere?

224
00:24:58,051 --> 00:25:00,195
Now let's get out of here,
while the beasties are busy.

225
00:25:03,274 --> 00:25:04,424
I am coming with you, my lords.

226
00:25:05,954 --> 00:25:08,062
What? Zoé, you can't
be serious.

227
00:25:08,063 --> 00:25:09,030
Sure I am.

228
00:25:09,065 --> 00:25:11,176
My uncle told me I had to come with
you to the end of the world.

229
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:13,235
Oh really? Weren't you punished?

230
00:25:13,236 --> 00:25:17,330
No. .. And what he also said was that 
I should learn the rudiments of the trade.

231
00:25:17,365 --> 00:25:20,235
No, no, no and no.

232
00:25:20,508 --> 00:25:24,727
You go home, explain to Uncle Arnold
that, Lord Gwizdo does not take on apprentices.

233
00:25:24,728 --> 00:25:28,306
He also said that if you don't
want to take me, he would ...

234
00:25:28,307 --> 00:25:29,533
He would ... what?

235
00:25:30,265 --> 00:25:32,886
He would spank your
bare bottom in public.

236
00:25:32,887 --> 00:25:35,154
My bare bottom?
In public?

237
00:26:35,957 --> 00:26:38,987
For crying out loud,
and he's spitting fire besides!

238
00:26:40,412 --> 00:26:43,410
No, what I meant was he
was doing it with his mouth, Hector.

239
00:26:52,441 --> 00:26:53,979
I don't see what's so funny.

240
00:27:46,029 --> 00:27:49,644
Wow! You sure messed up that big red dragon good,
Sir Lian-chu.

241
00:27:49,897 --> 00:27:54,075
That was so unreal,
I am so fabulously impressed.

242
00:27:54,657 --> 00:27:57,378
I've got to ...
find my flail.

243
00:27:57,484 --> 00:28:01,780
Your funny sword? Wait for me,
Sir Lian-chu, I'm going to find it for you.

244
00:28:01,781 --> 00:28:04,927
Okay, Sir Lian-chu's groupy,
your backstage chatter

245
00:28:05,022 --> 00:28:07,193
is very close to driving me bonkers.

246
00:28:07,194 --> 00:28:08,809
Tough luck for the public spanking.

247
00:28:08,882 --> 00:28:09,515
... so fabulously ...

248
00:28:09,933 --> 00:28:10,340
Zoé.

249
00:28:10,841 --> 00:28:12,854
You grab your bag and you get lost.

250
00:28:12,909 --> 00:28:15,896
You go home now.
We Don't travel well with little kids.

251
00:28:27,847 --> 00:28:32,448
Strange, but I have this funny feeling
that some real doo doo is gonna start flying.

252
00:28:32,483 --> 00:28:36,294
And Sir Knight Lian-chu was on the western bridge,
with a big red dragon ...

253
00:28:36,295 --> 00:28:39,990
who's breathing fire, and said to him,
in his big, deep voice:

254
00:28:39,991 --> 00:28:43,610
<i><b> I am not scared of you, Big Red,
one move from you and you are dead. </ b> </ i></b></i>

255
00:28:43,611 --> 00:28:47,231
Who is the man of a thousand teeth

256
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:49,871
The terror of dragons far and near

257
00:28:53,956 --> 00:28:56,176
Who is the man of the day

258
00:28:56,177 --> 00:29:01,344
It is him, of course, Silver Knight Gothic.

259
00:29:01,457 --> 00:29:03,138
How did you become a
real Knight, Lian-chu?

260
00:29:03,139 --> 00:29:04,496
Did you go to knight school?

261
00:29:04,497 --> 00:29:07,093
Wow this is really unreal
taking me with you.

262
00:29:07,094 --> 00:29:09,187
I mean,
really unreal!

263
00:29:09,604 --> 00:29:11,658
Are there girl knights?
Cause me, I want to be a girl knight.

264
00:29:11,659 --> 00:29:14,588
And that time you were hanging from the tips of your teeth ...
How'd you do that?

265
00:29:14,589 --> 00:29:17,266
And your funny sword there, is it a magic sword?

266
00:29:18,485 --> 00:29:19,889
Umm, uh, I don't really know know.

267
00:29:19,889 --> 00:29:21,988
The Silver Knight Gothic, he's modest too.

268
00:29:21,989 --> 00:29:22,594
He always says:

269
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:25,160
<i><b>  The modesty is the sign of
great knights like me. </ b> </ i></b></i>

270
00:29:25,161 --> 00:29:26,792
He's my favorite fairy tale hero.

271
00:29:26,793 --> 00:29:28,368
I would love to meet him one day.

272
00:29:28,369 --> 00:29:32,057
And become his best friend,
and his future girl knight ... unreal.

273
00:29:32,058 --> 00:29:35,056
But you can't in real life.
Uh huh bummer.

274
00:29:35,937 --> 00:29:38,729
I can't take it.
I'm gonna hang myself.

275
00:29:40,614 --> 00:29:41,811
They're only blisters.

276
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,943
Put some herbs on 'em.

277
00:29:44,043 --> 00:29:46,750
I'm not talking about my blisters,
I am talking about princess blabber mouth.

278
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:49,989
A fire, a fire,
let's make a big fire!

279
00:29:52,314 --> 00:29:55,995
In any case, did you see how
credible I am with her?

280
00:29:56,095 --> 00:29:56,545
Yeah

281
00:29:56,645 --> 00:30:00,139
But the idea of being credible, Lian-Chu was
take Uncle Arnold's money and run.

282
00:30:00,139 --> 00:30:02,890
Not to play the knights and dragons,
till the end of the world.

283
00:30:02,891 --> 00:30:05,720
The best friend of Lian-Chu always
went to get wood for the fire

284
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,595
along with the
funny blue dog who talks.

285
00:30:10,387 --> 00:30:15,487
Say there sir, am I mistaken or is
your dog is a bit weird?

286
00:30:15,827 --> 00:30:17,605
So, are you going to tell her that
we are not real knights?

287
00:30:17,605 --> 00:30:21,867
Yeah, right, and that we ripped off uncle fish eyes ...
and then she goes and spills the beans.

288
00:30:22,106 --> 00:30:24,331
No buddy,
we're in deep doo doo here.

289
00:30:25,492 --> 00:30:27,532
He sure is weird.

290
00:30:27,595 --> 00:30:28,900
But what do we do now?

291
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,885
Ditch her in the woods.

292
00:30:29,985 --> 00:30:33,309
There is no crying, no fuss, no
explanations ... Yeah, it's a sure fire method.

293
00:30:33,409 --> 00:30:36,554
And with a little luck she'll be
gobbled up by wild beasts.

294
00:30:36,654 --> 00:30:37,619
Are you sure?

295
00:30:37,719 --> 00:30:38,474
You bet I am.

296
00:30:38,574 --> 00:30:40,433
That World Gobbler and his of the little tree?

297
00:30:40,433 --> 00:30:41,389
Not for me.

298
00:30:41,424 --> 00:30:44,062
Tonight we'll wait till she falls asleep,
and zip, we're out of here.

299
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,132
Whose is this?

300
00:30:48,456 --> 00:30:50,456
It's Gwizdo's.

301
00:30:50,836 --> 00:30:52,090
That's so funny, sir ...

302
00:30:52,548 --> 00:30:55,800
I'm really sorry, but knitting is for grannies.

303
00:30:55,835 --> 00:30:56,542
No, it's not.

304
00:30:56,642 --> 00:30:57,498
It certainly is.

305
00:30:57,598 --> 00:31:00,015
She is absolutely right. Knitting
is for old ladies.

306
00:31:00,115 --> 00:31:03,277
The truth is my mother taught me
and knitting relaxes me ...

307
00:31:03,377 --> 00:31:05,287
especially after a long hard day.

308
00:31:05,387 --> 00:31:09,637
So scram, scat, and go
play with good old fido.

309
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:31,709
You really have a super ton of scars, sir.

310
00:31:31,809 --> 00:31:33,413
Say, those are hunting wounds,
right?

311
00:31:33,513 --> 00:31:35,297
Do they hurt? Me too. I've got some.

312
00:31:35,397 --> 00:31:37,344
That one was a wild squirrel when I
was playing in the trees.

313
00:31:37,444 --> 00:31:40,481
And rhat was a duck that was
fabulously angry one day.

314
00:31:40,581 --> 00:31:42,809
We used to have tons of ducks before
my parents died of Cholera.

315
00:31:42,909 --> 00:31:44,568
And then my uncle brought me
to his fortress.

316
00:31:44,668 --> 00:31:46,668
Don't you ever get tired?

317
00:31:46,915 --> 00:31:50,808
Sure, but I always need a
bed time story to get me to sleep.

318
00:31:50,908 --> 00:31:51,889
A bed time story?

319
00:31:51,989 --> 00:31:53,866
Oh yes, just a short one.

320
00:31:53,966 --> 00:31:54,884
Please, sir.

321
00:31:54,984 --> 00:31:57,742
You mean just one short story
and you go to sleep?

322
00:31:57,842 --> 00:32:02,894
Hey hey, no problem then, but it's one story
and then bedie bye, right? Then you fall asleep, okay?

323
00:32:02,994 --> 00:32:04,994
Let's do it.

324
00:32:10,964 --> 00:32:12,964
Silver Knight Gothic.

325
00:32:13,995 --> 00:32:18,198
And brave Silver Knight Gothic wrenched
the terrifying creature out of the shadows,

326
00:32:18,298 --> 00:32:22,025
His shiny scales were dripping
blood from the children he had just devoured ...

327
00:32:22,125 --> 00:32:26,043
 and whose terrifying screams still echoed
in the bone chilling wind of the labarynth.

328
00:32:26,143 --> 00:32:28,194
The fat slimy creature growled ...

329
00:32:28,294 --> 00:32:30,446
revealing his
sharp, crooked, yellow fangs

330
00:32:30,546 --> 00:32:32,296
he moved away from the oozing wall.

331
00:32:32,396 --> 00:32:35,042
The Silver Knight Gothic stared him
 straight in the eye and said,

332
00:32:35,142 --> 00:32:36,693
with a voice that did not waiver:

333
00:32:36,793 --> 00:32:40,533
I am not afraid of you,
dreadful thing

334
00:32:40,795 --> 00:32:45,361
for my heart is pure
as a fresh water spring.

335
00:32:45,461 --> 00:32:50,391
With my silver daggers
I shall lop off your head ...

336
00:32:50,632 --> 00:32:53,195
and justice will be done only
when you are dead.

337
00:32:53,295 --> 00:32:56,645
And the Silver Knight Gothic threw his silver daggers
that sparkle like diamonds

338
00:32:56,745 --> 00:32:59,260
and the monster died a terrible agony.

339
00:33:01,073 --> 00:33:03,423
Well, I never ...

340
00:33:04,081 --> 00:33:05,902
It's no wonder this girl
is a live wire.

341
00:33:06,002 --> 00:33:09,232
Kids should not be reading this stuff.

342
00:33:12,231 --> 00:33:17,392
Hey, she is fast asleep, Lian-Chu,
This is our chance, lets go.

343
00:33:17,492 --> 00:33:19,872
Hey, Lian-Chu, are you asleep?

344
00:33:21,467 --> 00:33:24,097
Come on, Lian-Chu,
Get up. Can you hear me?

345
00:33:24,197 --> 00:33:25,843
Lian-Chu, wake up.

346
00:33:25,943 --> 00:33:27,684
Hurry will ya', yah, look at me.

347
00:33:27,784 --> 00:33:30,704
Get up, get up, come on, come on Lian-Chu.

348
00:33:30,807 --> 00:33:32,108
Hey buddy, wake up.

349
00:33:32,109 --> 00:33:33,750
Can you hear me?

350
00:33:41,985 --> 00:33:42,976
Have a bad sleep?

351
00:33:43,076 --> 00:33:46,754
Tonight if you start snoring
again, I'm chopping of your nose.

352
00:33:48,077 --> 00:33:49,132
I was faking.

353
00:33:49,232 --> 00:33:50,342
What?

354
00:33:50,442 --> 00:33:51,862
You did that?

355
00:33:51,962 --> 00:33:53,158
But that is immoral.

356
00:33:53,258 --> 00:33:55,623
One doesn't abandon
children in the woods ...

357
00:33:55,723 --> 00:33:57,073
Of course you do.

358
00:33:57,173 --> 00:34:01,546
Our little farm Lian-Chu It's right there.
And you because of some little girl who thinks .. 

359
00:34:01,646 --> 00:34:02,935
She will get lost.

360
00:34:03,035 --> 00:34:04,298
I'm ready.

361
00:34:04,398 --> 00:34:08,539
Me, what I really like is a bulgarian omelette,
are the little pieces of mushrooms inside ...

362
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:13,104
Mmm, unreal ... so I ate the little pieces of mushrooms and
then Gildas he tries to make me eat the eggs.

363
00:34:13,204 --> 00:34:15,754
How bout' you, do you like eggs, sir Lian-Chu?

364
00:34:15,755 --> 00:34:17,554
To be honest, eggs, well I think they smell like stinky ...

365
00:34:17,702 --> 00:34:18,206
Yeah, well ...

366
00:34:18,207 --> 00:34:20,323
We are lost, too old buddy.

367
00:35:22,016 --> 00:35:24,300
Okay, let's be honest,
it's surely not that way.

368
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,026
On the other hand if we take the little
side bridge there, we reach

369
00:35:27,126 --> 00:35:29,207
the pretty little field of daisies
where we were yesterday.

370
00:35:29,704 --> 00:35:32,183
But sir Gwizdo, isn't it that way to the
end of the world?

371
00:35:32,283 --> 00:35:35,129
Okay, so it's fabulously unreal
that were taking you with us on our little adventure,

372
00:35:35,229 --> 00:35:37,797
Why don't you bug off and
let us work.

373
00:35:37,897 --> 00:35:40,624
And besides, no kid's
gonna teach me my geography, ok?

374
00:35:40,724 --> 00:35:44,165
Lensflair. It's sir Lensflair,
one of my uncle's best knights.

375
00:35:52,566 --> 00:35:54,284
Anatole, are you okay?

376
00:35:56,714 --> 00:36:00,029
back off you loony critters,
leave me in peace.

377
00:36:01,257 --> 00:36:04,785
What? But your'e not
animals, are you?

378
00:36:04,885 --> 00:36:06,689
No, its me, Zoé.

379
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:07,343
Zoé?

380
00:36:07,443 --> 00:36:08,808
Don't you recognize me?

381
00:36:08,908 --> 00:36:10,014
He's stark raving mad.

382
00:36:10,114 --> 00:36:11,305
He wasn't like that before.

383
00:36:11,405 --> 00:36:12,418
Zoé!

384
00:36:12,518 --> 00:36:15,319
I do not fear you, ugly thing.

385
00:36:15,419 --> 00:36:17,712
My heart is pure as
a fresh water spring.

386
00:36:19,554 --> 00:36:21,899
Over there, don't you see a knight?

387
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:27,598
Quiet, do as
I say, go home.

388
00:36:29,083 --> 00:36:30,732
But, my lord, the World Gobbler?

389
00:36:35,708 --> 00:36:37,428
Forget the World Gobbler, kid.  ...

390
00:36:39,481 --> 00:36:42,541
Are you spilling the beans again you old chatterbox?

391
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:45,510
No, no I'm not spilling the beans ...

392
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:48,652
Hey! That's sir Gwizdo and the great knight,
Lian-Chu.

393
00:36:48,653 --> 00:36:51,035
And they are gonna make kindling
out of the World Gobbler.

394
00:36:51,525 --> 00:36:53,820
What? But your mad ...

395
00:36:54,009 --> 00:36:57,664
Yes, you are.
You are mad ... Aren't you? ...

396
00:36:57,764 --> 00:36:58,751
Answer me, I know they are ...

397
00:37:01,696 --> 00:37:05,181
Your mad, mad, I know you are mad.

398
00:37:10,534 --> 00:37:13,701
I'm mad, I'm mad ...
everybody's mad!

399
00:37:13,702 --> 00:37:17,779
Mad, mad ...
I am so mad that I'm mad about being mad.

400
00:37:48,179 --> 00:37:50,782
Sir Lian-Chu, do you often have nightmares?

401
00:37:51,945 --> 00:37:54,248
Me too, often.
The same one.

402
00:37:54,283 --> 00:38:00,240
With the skeleton dragon, enormous, and I scream
and scream but nothing comes out of my mouth.

403
00:38:00,567 --> 00:38:02,951
And the Skeleton Dragon carries 
off everyone in sight.

404
00:38:06,682 --> 00:38:10,009
Sir Lian-Chu ... something around here
smells bad.

405
00:38:11,147 --> 00:38:13,978
And besides, my stomach is in knots,
my hands

406
00:38:14,078 --> 00:38:16,533
are sweaty, and my legs are shaking.

407
00:38:16,633 --> 00:38:18,843
And cold sweat's running down my neck.

408
00:38:18,974 --> 00:38:20,496
Is that normal?

409
00:38:20,596 --> 00:38:24,931
- Sir Lian-Chu, I think ..
I want to ... go back home.
- Shhh ....               

410
00:39:18,254 --> 00:39:20,254
The end of the world.

411
00:39:34,594 --> 00:39:36,974
Where did that village come from?

412
00:39:37,526 --> 00:39:41,776
Scary ghost town,
or stinky forest?

413
00:39:43,785 --> 00:39:46,165
Scary ghost town.

414
00:40:15,515 --> 00:40:17,515
What's the problem?

415
00:40:19,436 --> 00:40:21,436
The big tree.

416
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:24,660
Yeah, what about it?

417
00:40:25,278 --> 00:40:27,561
Those leaves are really strange.

418
00:40:27,661 --> 00:40:30,466
Good riddance stinky leaves.

419
00:40:34,439 --> 00:40:36,564
It's the crazy bats from the bridge!

420
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,654
Open up.

421
00:41:17,754 --> 00:41:19,754
Sir Gwizdo, open the door ...

422
00:41:33,404 --> 00:41:35,404
Whoa! not the ears, not the ears!

423
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:56,430
Good move with the barrel, kid.

424
00:41:56,628 --> 00:41:59,008
Yes .. go find your own.

425
00:42:47,208 --> 00:42:50,013
Quit bothering the sheep!

426
00:43:47,813 --> 00:43:50,448
I'll bury you alive, you ugly beast!

427
00:44:49,628 --> 00:44:52,652
<i><b>  Hey bats foo on you, Sir Lian-Chu is
too strong for you. </ b> </ i></b></i>

428
00:44:53,029 --> 00:44:56,930
<i><b>  Hey bats foo on you, Sir Lian-Chu is
too strong for you. </ b> </ i></b></i>

429
00:45:08,494 --> 00:45:11,259
Sir Gwizdo he left me all alone
with the disgusting bats.

430
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:13,515
I called for help, and he didn't budge.

431
00:45:13,516 --> 00:45:16,262
I knocked on the door, but
he didn't even open it.

432
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:29,785
And to think we could be
relaxing on our little farm.

433
00:46:29,885 --> 00:46:32,874
We have been talking about our
little farm for eons, right?

434
00:46:32,974 --> 00:46:36,355
Even since Mother Hubbards little
orphan paradise.

435
00:46:36,455 --> 00:46:38,564
Hey, do you remember when we were kids?

436
00:46:38,664 --> 00:46:40,873
When I taught you how to hide
cookies in your underpants,

437
00:46:40,973 --> 00:46:42,669
so the other
kids wouldn't steal them.

438
00:46:42,769 --> 00:46:46,593
And you gave a wedgie to the big guy with
lice every time he took my cookies!

439
00:46:46,693 --> 00:46:50,322
When the World Gobbler is dead,
we can have our little farm.

440
00:46:50,422 --> 00:46:54,566
Oh, right ... the great knight Lian-Chu
is going to say to the World Gobbler:

441
00:46:54,666 --> 00:46:56,029
<i><b>  I do not fear you ugly thing.
</ b> </ i></b></i>

442
00:46:56,030 --> 00:46:59,449
And poof, the World Gobbler is dead, and we're
all happy as pigs.

443
00:46:59,559 --> 00:47:00,131
Stop.

444
00:47:00,231 --> 00:47:00,880
I'm not finished.

445
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:02,814
And then nature blossoms
and everything is green,

446
00:47:02,914 --> 00:47:05,499
and are little white bunnies
flying all over the place.

447
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:07,599
Stop!

448
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:09,351
We're all gonna die!

449
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:11,332
Because of some little girl
that dreams of knights,

450
00:47:11,432 --> 00:47:13,091
but life's is not a fairy tale.

451
00:47:13,191 --> 00:47:16,168
In real life,
knights, they always die.

452
00:47:16,268 --> 00:47:19,413
I don't want you die, Lian-Chu!

453
00:47:19,483 --> 00:47:23,733
So why don't you step off the village,
if you don't want to come?

454
00:47:23,923 --> 00:47:25,665
Oh, so that's the way it is, huh?

455
00:47:25,765 --> 00:47:28,088
Well that's exactly what I'm gonna do.

456
00:47:28,188 --> 00:47:30,738
Farewell and good riddance, Knight Lian-Chu.

457
00:47:33,438 --> 00:47:34,421
Move.

458
00:47:47,598 --> 00:47:49,820
Why is sir Gwizdo leaving?

459
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,722
Because he says
we are all going to die.

460
00:47:51,822 --> 00:47:53,822
Oh that's a crock of poop.

461
00:47:54,211 --> 00:47:55,608
Maybe he is right, after all.

462
00:47:55,708 --> 00:47:56,868
No, he is not right.

463
00:47:56,968 --> 00:48:01,643
You are the strongest, 
stronger than Silver Knight Gothic.

464
00:48:03,789 --> 00:48:05,968
Gwizdo says that life
isn't a fairy tale.

465
00:48:06,068 --> 00:48:07,749
What does sir Gwizdo know anyway?

466
00:48:07,849 --> 00:48:09,560
And Besides, who is that Gwizdo?

467
00:48:09,561 --> 00:48:11,208
Lord Pain in the Butt?

468
00:48:11,371 --> 00:48:12,859
Sir Old Fart?

469
00:48:12,866 --> 00:48:15,076
Mr. Blister foot?

470
00:48:16,362 --> 00:48:18,657
He was my one friend.

471
00:50:45,529 --> 00:50:46,551
What are you doing here?

472
00:50:46,651 --> 00:50:48,175
Hello, Sir Gwizdo.

473
00:50:48,275 --> 00:50:51,165
So the rats jumping the ship,
is he?

474
00:50:51,414 --> 00:50:52,812
What's this circus all about?

475
00:50:52,912 --> 00:50:55,851
- You're Abandoning your friends.
- Lord McChicken.

476
00:50:55,951 --> 00:50:58,234
Wait a sec', what do you ladies want?

477
00:50:58,334 --> 00:50:59,980
to me feel guilty, is that it?

478
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:00,937
Scaredy pants.

479
00:51:01,037 --> 00:51:03,417
Scaredy pants?
Yeah, and so what?

480
00:51:03,475 --> 00:51:05,702
You think I look like the hero
of this fairy tale?

481
00:51:05,802 --> 00:51:09,117
And Lian-Chu, what's gonna happen to him?

482
00:51:10,089 --> 00:51:11,394
He won't listen to me.

483
00:51:11,394 --> 00:51:12,767
Sir I'm shaking like a leaf ..

484
00:51:12,867 --> 00:51:14,879
Sir I'm sh-sh-shaking like a leaf.

485
00:51:14,979 --> 00:51:16,025
It's all Zoés fault.

486
00:51:16,125 --> 00:51:17,827
- and the lie.
- Sir rip off artist.

487
00:51:17,927 --> 00:51:18,608
Shut up!

488
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:20,148
I didn't choose to be small and poor ...

489
00:51:20,248 --> 00:51:21,279
Do not forget ugly and mean.

490
00:51:21,379 --> 00:51:23,520
Exactly, ugly and mean!

491
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:27,849
Now get out of here, scram
just scram, bats, ahh ...

492
00:51:27,949 --> 00:51:30,972
I do not believe in heroism ...
and "happily ever after."!

493
00:51:31,007 --> 00:51:33,527
and animals that talk! ...

494
00:51:36,669 --> 00:51:38,669
Animals that talk.

495
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:55,540
Gwizdo.

496
00:52:03,393 --> 00:52:05,393
Zoé.

497
00:52:29,198 --> 00:52:31,198
Lian-Chu.

498
00:53:07,679 --> 00:53:09,679
Sir Lian-Chu.

499
00:53:13,721 --> 00:53:14,787
Sir Lian-Chu.

500
00:53:14,887 --> 00:53:18,627
Weird things are happening
underneath the village.

501
00:53:19,194 --> 00:53:21,194
Just wait for me here.

502
00:53:22,219 --> 00:53:26,237
Tell me honestly kid, what
do I have at the end of my arms?

503
00:53:26,337 --> 00:53:27,178
Hands?

504
00:53:27,278 --> 00:53:29,278
Wrong!

505
00:53:30,539 --> 00:53:32,539
Hello, there little Zoé.

506
00:53:34,574 --> 00:53:37,707
Lian-Chu, Sir Gwizdo is
doing weird things with his hands.

507
00:53:37,807 --> 00:53:41,122
Like knight Lensflair.

508
00:54:04,415 --> 00:54:06,455
We've got to get a bigger village.

509
00:54:41,083 --> 00:54:43,655
Come on now, quit fooling around sir Gwizdo.

510
00:54:43,755 --> 00:54:45,755
It's not funny.

511
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:50,143
Hello little kiddies. 
Would you like a story?

512
00:54:50,243 --> 00:54:51,968
Yes, yes, tell us a story.

513
00:54:52,068 --> 00:54:55,612
The story about the naive little girl who
mistook two lowly rogues for noble knights ...

514
00:54:55,712 --> 00:54:57,712
No. ..

515
00:54:57,786 --> 00:54:59,465
We've already heard that one ...

516
00:54:59,565 --> 00:55:00,806
Then another one, another one!

517
00:55:00,906 --> 00:55:02,906
Another please, please ...

518
00:55:05,276 --> 00:55:08,076
And the one about the nice hunter 
devoured by the World Gobbler?

519
00:55:08,176 --> 00:55:11,201
Because of some little girl who
dreamed of noble knights!

520
00:55:11,301 --> 00:55:13,851
Yeah, yeah, that one really stinks.

521
00:55:13,986 --> 00:55:18,151
And one of the two red bats that
strangled the little girl?

522
00:55:19,382 --> 00:55:21,847
Oh yes, oh yes, that's the one,
Ha ha ha ha!

523
00:55:58,724 --> 00:56:00,724
Zoé.

524
00:56:01,478 --> 00:56:03,114
Zoé.

525
00:56:03,214 --> 00:56:04,986
Zoé!

526
00:56:41,697 --> 00:56:44,927
I can't feel my legs ...

527
00:56:53,053 --> 00:56:54,673
Your legs are just fine,

528
00:56:54,773 --> 00:56:56,898
you had a bad fall, that's all.

529
00:56:58,003 --> 00:57:00,003
You were right Gwizdo.

530
00:57:00,748 --> 00:57:03,808
Life isn't a fairy tale.

531
00:57:05,738 --> 00:57:07,074
But you know,

532
00:57:07,174 --> 00:57:09,848
It doesn't matter if you're not really.

533
00:57:09,948 --> 00:57:12,923
You're still my favorite heroes.

534
00:57:14,665 --> 00:57:18,772
Lian-Chu, he's even stronger
than Silver Knight Gothic,

535
00:57:18,872 --> 00:57:21,219
and that's no fairy tale.

536
00:57:21,319 --> 00:57:24,294
All you have to do is believe.

537
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:28,715
But Lian-Chu needs you in order to succeed.

538
00:57:30,477 --> 00:57:33,721
Promise me you'll carry through
 'til the end, Gwizdo ...

539
00:57:33,821 --> 00:57:37,051
and my death won't have been in vain.

540
00:57:40,538 --> 00:57:42,206
 It's a promise Zoé.

541
00:57:42,306 --> 00:57:44,688
We're gonna make kindling out
of the World Gobbler.

542
00:57:47,317 --> 00:57:49,317
Really?

543
00:57:49,961 --> 00:57:51,254
I swear we will.

544
00:57:51,354 --> 00:57:53,354
Oh, thank you, Gwizdo!

545
00:57:53,757 --> 00:57:55,757
But, you ...

546
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:57,120
You're not hurt?

547
00:57:57,220 --> 00:57:58,489
Nope.

548
00:57:58,589 --> 00:58:00,589
I just fell down there.

549
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:04,925
You, but that ... that's immoral.

550
00:58:05,375 --> 00:58:07,041
Do you realize what a fright you gave us?

551
00:58:07,141 --> 00:58:08,477
You were really scared?

552
00:58:08,577 --> 00:58:10,081
Of course I was!

553
00:58:10,181 --> 00:58:13,156
That means that love me.

554
00:58:18,436 --> 00:58:19,845
Okay, partys over guys.

555
00:58:19,845 --> 00:58:21,843
We got us a World Gobbler to slay.

556
00:59:09,809 --> 00:59:12,359
What's that giant tree?

557
00:59:18,777 --> 00:59:20,777
<i><b>  It's for scale sir. </ b> </ i></b></i>

558
00:59:24,566 --> 00:59:26,030
That noise, what is it?

559
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:27,370
Is that an earthquake?

560
00:59:27,470 --> 00:59:28,413
No,

561
00:59:28,513 --> 00:59:30,513
it was snoring.

562
00:59:30,730 --> 00:59:32,730
We have to find it.

563
01:00:56,548 --> 01:00:58,089
Take cover!

564
01:00:58,189 --> 01:01:00,189
Monster bat?

565
01:01:02,306 --> 01:01:04,306
My nightmare ...

566
01:01:05,487 --> 01:01:08,887
That's the skeleton dragon
of my nightmares.

567
01:01:39,882 --> 01:01:41,897
Lian-Chu come back!

568
01:02:22,644 --> 01:02:24,644
Lian-Chu run!

569
01:02:54,172 --> 01:02:56,341
Help, Lian-Chu!

570
01:03:17,682 --> 01:03:21,188
I'm sorry Gwizdo, 
we are all going to die!

571
01:03:21,719 --> 01:03:25,300
Zoé look at me, we gotta
believe, isn't that what you said?

572
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,702
So hang on, hang on, hang on.

573
01:03:27,802 --> 01:03:31,032
I believe, I believe, I believe.

574
01:03:41,976 --> 01:03:47,331
I believe, I believe ...

575
01:03:55,442 --> 01:03:57,442
Lian-Chu!

576
01:04:37,284 --> 01:04:39,284
Lian-Chu!

577
01:04:47,302 --> 01:04:49,302
Leave them alone!

578
01:05:05,159 --> 01:05:08,049
I do not fear you,
ugly thing.

579
01:05:08,564 --> 01:05:13,324
My heart is pure as a
fresh water spring.

580
01:06:03,172 --> 01:06:05,438
Get up Lian-Chu!

581
01:06:15,406 --> 01:06:17,406
Go for it, Lian-Chu!

582
01:08:06,570 --> 01:08:08,780
Everything is reall pretty now.

583
01:08:17,270 --> 01:08:19,310
Now over there will be the barn ...

584
01:08:20,151 --> 01:08:22,151
Oh, and there the chicken coops.

585
01:08:22,529 --> 01:08:23,899
What do you mean?

586
01:08:23,683 --> 01:08:25,122
Our little farm old buddy.

587
01:08:24,881 --> 01:08:26,452
With sheep for your wool.

588
01:08:29,032 --> 01:08:32,195
And there the mill, for
bread, a big mill.

589
01:08:32,295 --> 01:08:35,400
And over there your sheep barn,
and when I say sheep barn ..

590
01:08:35,401 --> 01:08:37,742
I mean a real sheep barn.

591
01:08:47,982 --> 01:08:49,982
And here, our house.

592
01:08:55,346 --> 01:08:58,151
With your bed room, my bed room ...

593
01:09:00,759 --> 01:09:02,759
and Zoés bed room.

594
01:09:03,253 --> 01:09:06,938
A big room with a view
of the flying bunny rabbits,

595
01:09:07,038 --> 01:09:08,984
whenever she comes to see us 
during the holidays, right?

596
01:09:09,084 --> 01:09:11,084
Yes!

597
01:09:18,309 --> 01:09:20,604
So we gonna go pick up Uncle Arnies cash?

598
01:09:20,704 --> 01:09:22,704
We certainly deserve it.

599
01:09:52,163 --> 01:09:55,223
Where are my noble knights?

600
01:09:57,859 --> 01:10:00,953
But, but my great and wealthy Lord,
we're here ...

601
01:10:01,053 --> 01:10:01,829
You?

602
01:10:01,929 --> 01:10:06,689
Yeah, Lian-Chu and Gwizdo,
ya know, dragon hunters.

603
01:10:08,478 --> 01:10:11,624
All right look, isn't that your X
at the bottom of this parchment?

604
01:10:11,724 --> 01:10:13,185
Allright, enough of this,

605
01:10:13,285 --> 01:10:15,109
I don't see any hunters.

606
01:10:15,209 --> 01:10:17,865
What I see are two coarse and lowly rogues...

607
01:10:17,965 --> 01:10:21,516
With all due respect, my
Lord, I do believe I did warn you ...

608
01:10:21,616 --> 01:10:25,403
But Uncle, it's really true,
Lian-Chu killed the World Gobbler.

609
01:10:25,503 --> 01:10:28,088
that is why you were cured and
nature has blossomed,

610
01:10:28,188 --> 01:10:29,928
and there are little bunnies everywhere.

611
01:10:30,028 --> 01:10:33,115
And you little runaway, your
tall tales will get you nowhere.

612
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:36,044
They are not tall tales, the Lian-Chu is a hero.

613
01:10:36,144 --> 01:10:38,354
Get out of my sight insolent girl.

614
01:10:38,422 --> 01:10:41,222
Your eyes are even more inside out than before.

615
01:10:41,322 --> 01:10:44,318
Off to the convent, little pest.

616
01:10:44,629 --> 01:10:46,629
So much the better.

617
01:10:48,408 --> 01:10:51,629
Because I would rather go
to the crooked tooth convent than

618
01:10:51,729 --> 01:10:55,255
live with a bitter, heartless, ugly old fart
who doesn't even love me.

619
01:10:55,355 --> 01:10:57,565
Zoé get back here immediately.

620
01:10:57,619 --> 01:10:58,904
Zoés right!

621
01:10:59,004 --> 01:11:02,566
Your really a looser, 
and besides, your mean to little girls ...

622
01:11:02,666 --> 01:11:07,000
you don't know Zoé, she is kind,
she's courageous, and she's intelligent,

623
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:11,180
she deserves so much better than a dishonest, 
self centered, meiserly old uncle,

624
01:11:11,774 --> 01:11:14,386
and with all due respect I have
for the boogers in my nose

625
01:11:14,486 --> 01:11:20,351
I would like to know what Lord
Arnold, The Butt Wipe, has to say about that!

626
01:11:29,039 --> 01:11:32,779
Ow, ooh. I tell ya
kings are not respectable people.

627
01:11:33,317 --> 01:11:36,616
It was when you called him Arnold
the Butt Wipe, that he really got mad.

628
01:11:36,716 --> 01:11:40,222
Hey, hey, just a sec there Mr. coward,
you could have done something.

629
01:11:40,322 --> 01:11:42,856
Why, you did a great
job on your own.

630
01:11:42,956 --> 01:11:45,727
A great job,
are you pulling my leg?

631
01:11:45,827 --> 01:11:49,992
If it wasn't for you,  Zoé
would have gotten spanked on her bare bottom.

632
01:11:53,503 --> 01:11:55,075
You know,

633
01:11:55,175 --> 01:11:57,175
you're right.

634
01:11:59,546 --> 01:12:02,094
You think that we'll see Zoé again someday?

635
01:12:02,194 --> 01:12:03,323
Forget about her buddy.

636
01:12:03,423 --> 01:12:05,061
Look at us, nothing has changed,

637
01:12:05,161 --> 01:12:11,451
we're still two course and lowly rouges just good
for getting our butts kicked by royalty.

638
01:12:11,959 --> 01:12:14,479
Hey, wait up for me, noble knights.

639
01:12:14,579 --> 01:12:16,945
Zoé, what are you doing here?

640
01:12:17,045 --> 01:12:19,765
The old crooked tooth isn't my style.

641
01:12:20,308 --> 01:12:23,538
I'm gonna go live on the little farm with you guys.

642
01:12:23,592 --> 01:12:25,116
What little farm?

643
01:12:25,216 --> 01:12:28,106
You know, the one you dream of,

644
01:12:28,744 --> 01:12:33,164
with a big mill and the
barn and sheep, for wool.

645
01:12:37,649 --> 01:12:40,524
Zoé, I love you.

646
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:56,971
THE END
