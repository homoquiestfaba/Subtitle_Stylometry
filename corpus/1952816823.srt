Previously on Chase

00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,400
- US Marshals, hands in the air.
- This is a private party.

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,297
We've got a warrant
to search the premises.

4
00:00:06,382 --> 00:00:07,748
And for Pablo Cordova's arrest.

5
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,750
Hey, Isabella didn't just

6
00:00:09,802 --> 00:00:11,803
take down Max Ramirez;
she killed

7
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:15,256
two of my guys. Anything happens
to my wife, I will blame you.

8
00:00:16,142 --> 00:00:16,975
It's a tracker.

9
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:19,060
O'Neil knew

10
00:00:19,111 --> 00:00:20,612
that Perez was gonna have
this briefcase

11
00:00:20,696 --> 00:00:21,980
when he met the new witness.

12
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:23,932
Dan O'Neil's
an assistant U.S. attorney.

13
00:00:23,999 --> 00:00:25,066
Everybody's got a price.

14
00:00:25,117 --> 00:00:25,950
Dan O'Neil.

15
00:00:26,035 --> 00:00:28,119
You're under arrest.

16
00:00:28,204 --> 00:00:29,954
Hello?

17
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:31,990
This is Deputy U.S. Marshal
Annie Frost,

18
00:00:32,074 --> 00:00:34,576
and your son will face
the death penalty

19
00:00:34,627 --> 00:00:36,578
for eight counts of murder,
unless you turn yourself in.

20
00:00:36,629 --> 00:00:38,246
Here she is. Go! Put
your hands on the car.

21
00:00:38,297 --> 00:00:40,632
Isabella, what are
you doing here?

22
00:00:40,716 --> 00:00:41,432
We had a deal.

23
00:00:45,004 --> 00:00:47,172
Matthew!

24
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:48,289
Isabella.

27
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:22,767
I like being engaged.

28
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,387
Mmm...

29
00:02:26,455 --> 00:02:29,457
Me, too.

30
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:38,066
No. No.

31
00:02:40,269 --> 00:02:42,203
They can live

32
00:02:42,254 --> 00:02:44,439
without you for an hour.

33
00:02:44,506 --> 00:02:46,441
I can't.

34
00:02:46,508 --> 00:02:48,443
Mmm.

35
00:02:50,246 --> 00:02:52,297
This is...
Let me just...

36
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:53,581
Let me just...
No.

37
00:02:54,934 --> 00:02:57,252
This is Jimmy.

38
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:05,760
Hey, now, you listen to me.
I'll be there in ten minutes.

39
00:03:05,828 --> 00:03:07,228
You hear me?

40
00:03:21,844 --> 00:03:24,612
Diles que estamos aqui.

41
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:52,523
La tenemos.
Vamonos rapido.

42
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:54,709
Si, senor.

43
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,451
In here.

44
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:08,623
Put her in the trunk.

45
00:04:08,674 --> 00:04:09,990
Bitch broke my nose.

46
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:11,876
Go home, Chavez.

47
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,662
And torch that car.

00:04:29,796 --> 00:04:33,916
Mr. Cordova, words
cannot bring back a wife, a son.

50
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,720
Comfort can be felt in knowing
that they are now in the Kingdom

51
00:04:37,804 --> 00:04:39,171
of Heaven.

52
00:04:39,222 --> 00:04:40,923
May their souls and the souls

53
00:04:41,007 --> 00:04:44,009
of all the faithful departed
through the grace of God

54
00:04:44,077 --> 00:04:46,011
rest in peace.

55
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:48,047
U.S. Marshals!

56
00:04:48,114 --> 00:04:49,098
Get down.

57
00:04:49,182 --> 00:04:50,849
Out of the way.
Where is she?

58
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,369
Where is she? I'm
burying my wife and child.

59
00:04:53,436 --> 00:04:55,387
Where is my partner? Your men
didn't cover their tracks, Pablo.

60
00:04:55,438 --> 00:04:57,523
We know it was
you. Then prove it.

61
00:04:57,574 --> 00:04:59,725
Jimmy, come here. It's all
right. You want to fight?

62
00:04:59,776 --> 00:05:01,276
Come here! Jimmy, Jimmy,
not here, not here.

63
00:05:01,361 --> 00:05:02,894
Not this way.
Not this way.

64
00:05:04,597 --> 00:05:07,449
Jimmy, I didn't know

65
00:05:07,534 --> 00:05:09,418
you were married.

66
00:05:09,502 --> 00:05:10,753
Good to know.

67
00:05:10,837 --> 00:05:12,904
You better let her go,
or you're a dead man.

68
00:05:12,956 --> 00:05:14,540
I'm already dead. This is harassment.

69
00:05:14,607 --> 00:05:16,925
Stay away from my client.
Oh, you again?

70
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:17,760
Jimmy, let's go.

71
00:05:17,844 --> 00:05:19,445
We warned him.

72
00:05:19,512 --> 00:05:21,246
It's your one warning.
It's your one warning.

73
00:05:21,297 --> 00:05:23,799
Get 'em out of here!
Get 'em out of here!

74
00:05:27,387 --> 00:05:29,638
Think we rattled him?

75
00:05:29,723 --> 00:05:32,090
Yeah, with any luck,
he'll be calling Hector now.

76
00:05:32,142 --> 00:05:34,259
And we'll track the
call right to Annie.

77
00:06:02,472 --> 00:06:05,307
Quitalo.

78
00:06:05,391 --> 00:06:07,659
Welcome.

79
00:06:07,727 --> 00:06:11,730
Pablo Cordova wants you
to see where you will die.

80
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:17,636
Cuidado.

81
00:06:17,687 --> 00:06:20,572
Es una combatiente.

82
00:06:43,463 --> 00:06:45,564
Pongenla!

83
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,868
Hopefully, we have
better luck with the SUV.

84
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:24,253
The owner reported it stolen

85
00:07:24,337 --> 00:07:26,305
from the parking lot
of the Houston Galleria.

86
00:07:26,372 --> 00:07:27,639
That mall has
cameras everywhere.

87
00:07:27,707 --> 00:07:29,641
Yeah? I had the tapes
brought over.

88
00:07:32,378 --> 00:07:34,429
You guys want to tell me why

89
00:07:34,514 --> 00:07:35,881
I'm missing my
kid's football game?

90
00:07:35,932 --> 00:07:37,566
Hey, Frank,

91
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:39,434
you want to give us a minute?

92
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,520
Thanks.

93
00:07:46,593 --> 00:07:47,693
What is it?

94
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,861
Annie's been kidnapped.

95
00:07:48,928 --> 00:07:50,028
What?

96
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:51,230
By the Allende Cartel.

97
00:07:51,297 --> 00:07:53,065
You're one of only five people
who know.

98
00:07:53,132 --> 00:07:55,067
My lips are sealed.

99
00:07:55,134 --> 00:07:56,435
What can I do to help?

100
00:07:56,502 --> 00:07:59,037
Owner said he parked
in the Green Lot, Level Two.

101
00:07:59,088 --> 00:08:01,106
Arrived about 7:30.

102
00:08:03,676 --> 00:08:05,444
Right there.

103
00:08:05,511 --> 00:08:07,095
That's the SUV that
hit Annie's car.

104
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:10,082
Looks like they're staking out
which car they're gonna get.

105
00:08:10,149 --> 00:08:11,650
Something big enough
to ram Annie's Escalade.

106
00:08:11,718 --> 00:08:13,552
Can you get the plate
off the Trans Am?

107
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,554
Yeah, yeah.

108
00:08:15,622 --> 00:08:17,122
Here's hoping it isn't stolen.

109
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,440
It's not.

110
00:08:18,524 --> 00:08:20,943
It's registered
to a... Peter Chavez.

111
00:08:21,027 --> 00:08:22,928
He lives in Fondren Southwest.

112
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:24,730
Run him through the JIMS database.

113
00:08:24,781 --> 00:08:26,765
Got it.

114
00:08:28,301 --> 00:08:29,468
He's got a record.

115
00:08:29,535 --> 00:08:30,836
Possession With Intent to Sell?

116
00:08:30,904 --> 00:08:33,105
Yeah, and look
where he was arrested.

117
00:08:33,172 --> 00:08:34,990
NightLight Club.
That's one of Cordova's places.

118
00:08:35,074 --> 00:08:37,108
We just found one
of Annie's kidnappers.

119
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,180
Man in his 20s.

120
00:08:42,248 --> 00:08:43,799
And we believe
that he works here.

121
00:08:43,883 --> 00:08:46,501
Goes by the name
of Peter Chavez.

122
00:08:46,586 --> 00:08:47,970
Peter Chavez!

123
00:08:49,589 --> 00:08:52,174
U.S. Marshals!

124
00:09:06,022 --> 00:09:08,139
Put him on the car.

125
00:09:09,909 --> 00:09:11,360
Where's Annie Frost? Who?

126
00:09:11,444 --> 00:09:13,445
Where?! I don't know
who you're talking about.

127
00:09:13,496 --> 00:09:15,313
We got you on tape.
You're done.

128
00:09:15,365 --> 00:09:16,615
You're looking at
the death penalty.

129
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:18,149
Tell us what you know
right now!

130
00:09:18,201 --> 00:09:19,317
I'm not telling you jack.

131
00:09:19,369 --> 00:09:20,485
I want my lawyer.

132
00:09:20,536 --> 00:09:22,320
Oh, yeah? Well,
you can't have one.

133
00:09:32,181 --> 00:09:33,632
So, we're gonna bring

134
00:09:33,683 --> 00:09:36,001
the U.S. Attorney's Office
in on this, right?

135
00:09:36,052 --> 00:09:37,569
Get them to offer a deal?

136
00:09:37,637 --> 00:09:40,672
We turn him in, and he'll
never flip on Cordova.

137
00:09:40,723 --> 00:09:43,675
Last guy who did
ended up in a barrel.

138
00:09:43,726 --> 00:09:45,394
Well, what other option
do we have?

139
00:09:48,381 --> 00:09:51,733
We hand him over to
the Satevo Cartel.

140
00:09:51,818 --> 00:09:53,485
They'll find out
what we need to know.

141
00:09:53,553 --> 00:09:54,653
Jimmy, we can't do that.

142
00:09:54,704 --> 00:09:56,154
That son of a bitch
has got information

143
00:09:56,205 --> 00:09:57,823
that could lead us to
Annie. You hear me?

144
00:09:57,874 --> 00:09:59,908
Look, I care about Annie
just as much as you do.

145
00:09:59,993 --> 00:10:01,593
Okay, but you're talking
about breaking the law...

146
00:10:01,661 --> 00:10:03,161
Listen, if you're
worried about your ass,

147
00:10:03,212 --> 00:10:04,496
then go back to the bullpen

148
00:10:04,564 --> 00:10:06,364
and you stay the
hell out of my way.

149
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:07,599
Jimmy, why would the Satevos

150
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:09,301
help us?

151
00:10:09,368 --> 00:10:11,036
Because they're at
war with Cordova,

152
00:10:11,104 --> 00:10:12,704
and helping us
means hurting him.

153
00:10:12,755 --> 00:10:16,925
We cross the line,
no coming back.

154
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:18,376
Look, guys, playing the cartels

155
00:10:18,428 --> 00:10:20,729
against each other is
the only chance we have

156
00:10:20,813 --> 00:10:22,214
to get Annie back alive.
They're gonna kill him.

157
00:10:22,281 --> 00:10:24,383
We don't know that.

158
00:10:28,021 --> 00:10:30,922
Looks like you're the
odd guy out, Luke.

159
00:10:32,525 --> 00:10:36,395
We need to bring in the chief,
get other agencies involved...

160
00:10:36,462 --> 00:10:38,697
You listen to me.

161
00:10:38,748 --> 00:10:42,034
You want Annie killed, huh?

162
00:10:42,101 --> 00:10:43,935
Then go blow the whistle.

163
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:55,263
You make sure that
doesn't happen.

164
00:10:55,348 --> 00:10:56,481
Yeah.

165
00:10:56,549 --> 00:10:57,949
Let's go.
Hey.

166
00:11:00,219 --> 00:11:01,620
I hope you're right about this.

167
00:11:01,687 --> 00:11:03,772
Me, too.

168
00:11:16,119 --> 00:11:17,235
No!

169
00:11:17,286 --> 00:11:19,604
No!

170
00:11:23,376 --> 00:11:24,476
No!

171
00:11:45,681 --> 00:11:48,567
Hola?

172
00:11:48,634 --> 00:11:50,635
QuiÃn estáahi?

173
00:11:52,071 --> 00:11:53,972
I-I don't
speak Spanish.

174
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,359
My name's Annie.
What's yours?

175
00:11:57,443 --> 00:12:00,011
Tim.

176
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,848
How old are you, Tim?

177
00:12:05,284 --> 00:12:07,385
If they hear us talking,
they'll hurt us.

178
00:12:13,059 --> 00:12:15,193
How'd you get here?

179
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:21,666
They took me from my house.

180
00:12:21,717 --> 00:12:24,436
Why?

181
00:12:24,504 --> 00:12:25,704
My dad.

182
00:12:25,771 --> 00:12:28,190
He's a prosecutor in Houston.

183
00:12:28,274 --> 00:12:29,875
What's his name?

184
00:12:29,942 --> 00:12:34,246
I-I work there as a...
as a U.S. Marshal.

185
00:12:36,549 --> 00:12:37,682
D-Dan O'Neil.

186
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,751
Do you know him?

187
00:12:41,787 --> 00:12:43,555
No.

188
00:12:45,491 --> 00:12:49,461
But I'm sure
he misses you very much.

189
00:12:59,305 --> 00:13:01,306
How long have you
been here, Tim?

190
00:13:02,975 --> 00:13:06,545
I started counting 42 days ago.

191
00:13:11,851 --> 00:13:13,718
Hmm...

192
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,167
Leave your guns here.

193
00:13:27,235 --> 00:13:28,335
That's not gonna happen.

194
00:13:28,403 --> 00:13:31,705
Jorge, it's okay.

195
00:13:31,773 --> 00:13:33,407
Let them in.

196
00:13:33,475 --> 00:13:35,592
Thanks, Jorge.

197
00:13:37,812 --> 00:13:39,179
Zolo.

198
00:13:39,247 --> 00:13:41,982
Martinez. Long time.

199
00:13:43,018 --> 00:13:45,185
Been a while.
Mm-hmm. Orale.

200
00:13:48,523 --> 00:13:50,457
Uh...

201
00:13:50,525 --> 00:13:52,459
Lot of soldiers here, Zolo.
You may have heard.

202
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:54,595
I'm in the middle
of a business dispute.

203
00:13:54,662 --> 00:13:56,030
We were told that Cordova

204
00:13:56,097 --> 00:13:58,799
offered a million dollars
for your head.

205
00:14:00,685 --> 00:14:02,269
Maybe you shouldn't have
killed his family.

206
00:14:05,573 --> 00:14:08,709
Your friend has a very funny way
of asking for help.

207
00:14:09,711 --> 00:14:12,079
I'm not asking.

208
00:14:13,898 --> 00:14:16,917
My partner was kidnapped by
Cordova, and I want to know

209
00:14:16,985 --> 00:14:18,652
where she is.

210
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,853
Am I Cordova?

211
00:14:19,921 --> 00:14:21,655
How is this my problem?

212
00:14:21,723 --> 00:14:22,856
Once the word gets out

213
00:14:22,924 --> 00:14:25,592
that a U.S. Marshal was
kidnapped by a drug cartel,

214
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:28,228
it'll become
your problem, Zolo.

215
00:14:28,296 --> 00:14:30,998
It's gonna bring
down a lot of heat.

216
00:14:31,066 --> 00:14:32,699
On all the cartels.

217
00:14:32,767 --> 00:14:36,170
Every agency in the country's
gonna be crawling up your ass.

218
00:14:36,237 --> 00:14:37,337
It's gonna be bad for business,

219
00:14:37,405 --> 00:14:40,574
Zolo...
It's gonna cost you millions.

220
00:14:40,642 --> 00:14:42,810
So?

221
00:14:42,877 --> 00:14:45,712
What do you want?

222
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,748
Information.

223
00:14:51,653 --> 00:14:53,987
Give me a call when he talks.

224
00:15:00,945 --> 00:15:03,263
Tim?

225
00:15:06,084 --> 00:15:07,400
Who brings you food here?

226
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:11,138
Victor.

227
00:15:11,206 --> 00:15:14,975
He brings us rice once a day.

228
00:15:15,043 --> 00:15:16,877
Does Victor do that by himself?

229
00:15:16,928 --> 00:15:19,379
Or does he bring
a guard with him?

230
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:24,351
Tim?

231
00:15:26,688 --> 00:15:28,622
You got to help me.

232
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,691
So I can help us.

233
00:15:34,462 --> 00:15:36,797
If you help me, I promise you,

234
00:15:36,865 --> 00:15:40,534
you are going
to see your parents again.

235
00:15:45,006 --> 00:15:47,791
Now, tell me about Victor.

236
00:15:57,836 --> 00:15:59,853
Allende soldiers.

237
00:15:59,921 --> 00:16:01,621
No backbone.

238
00:16:01,673 --> 00:16:03,490
What did he say?

239
00:16:03,558 --> 00:16:05,993
Deputy Frost is still alive.

240
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,961
But she's not
in the country anymore.

241
00:16:08,029 --> 00:16:09,796
You better not be lying to me.

242
00:16:09,864 --> 00:16:12,666
Cordova had her taken to Mexico.

243
00:16:12,734 --> 00:16:13,867
Where in Mexico?

244
00:16:13,935 --> 00:16:15,636
Chavez didn't know.

245
00:16:15,703 --> 00:16:17,871
Believe me. If he had,
he would have said something.

246
00:16:17,939 --> 00:16:20,473
But he did say that
Cordova had left orders

247
00:16:20,525 --> 00:16:21,475
for her to remain alive.

248
00:16:21,543 --> 00:16:22,709
He's going to ransom her?

249
00:16:22,777 --> 00:16:24,511
To kill her.

250
00:16:24,579 --> 00:16:26,280
But he wants to do it himself.

251
00:16:26,347 --> 00:16:28,615
I should've killed the son of
a bitch when I had a chance.

252
00:16:28,683 --> 00:16:30,117
Maybe you still should.

253
00:16:30,185 --> 00:16:32,152
If Cordova gets to Mexico,

254
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,188
your partner is dead.

255
00:16:41,095 --> 00:16:43,347
You're trying to get an
arrest warrant for Cordova?

256
00:16:43,431 --> 00:16:45,332
News travels fast.

257
00:16:45,383 --> 00:16:47,667
Well, the judge released him
yesterday for lack of evidence.

258
00:16:47,719 --> 00:16:48,852
You better have
something juicy.

259
00:16:48,937 --> 00:16:50,070
Nothing you can use, Perez.

260
00:16:50,138 --> 00:16:51,471
Come on.

261
00:16:51,523 --> 00:16:52,839
DEA spent the last 22 months

262
00:16:52,907 --> 00:16:54,691
building a case against Cordova.
Tell me what you got.

263
00:16:54,776 --> 00:16:55,726
You don't want to ask.

264
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:57,027
Okay. I won't.

265
00:16:57,111 --> 00:16:58,511
But Melissa Randolph will.

266
00:16:58,563 --> 00:17:00,847
Our new acting U.S. Attorney
isn't the rule-bending type.

267
00:17:00,915 --> 00:17:02,182
She doesn't want
to end up in prison

268
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,067
like her ex-boss.
Right.

269
00:17:04,152 --> 00:17:06,520
You have evidence that Cordova's
about to commit a murder,

270
00:17:06,588 --> 00:17:08,155
but you won't tell me
how you know,

271
00:17:08,223 --> 00:17:10,424
and who he's gonna kill?
Sounds promising.

272
00:17:10,491 --> 00:17:11,625
Look, we can't
divulge our source.

273
00:17:11,693 --> 00:17:12,859
You think lawyers

274
00:17:12,927 --> 00:17:15,062
don't deal with
confidential informants, too?

275
00:17:15,129 --> 00:17:16,897
Ma'am, with all due respect,

276
00:17:16,965 --> 00:17:18,382
until everyone in
this office is clear

277
00:17:18,466 --> 00:17:19,700
of the allegations...

278
00:17:19,767 --> 00:17:22,970
My boss was the one selling info
to the Allende Cartel.

279
00:17:23,037 --> 00:17:24,755
I can vouch
for everyone in this office.

280
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:27,274
Cordova can and will
get to anybody.

281
00:17:27,342 --> 00:17:28,442
We can't risk it.

282
00:17:28,509 --> 00:17:30,394
And I can't ask a judge

283
00:17:30,478 --> 00:17:33,013
to issue an arrest warrant
with no probable cause.

284
00:17:33,081 --> 00:17:35,399
We're talking
about a person's life.

285
00:17:35,483 --> 00:17:37,618
And you're giving me
nothing to work with.

286
00:17:37,685 --> 00:17:38,952
I'm sorry.

287
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,955
Right.

288
00:17:42,023 --> 00:17:44,358
You know what? Screw the
warrant. I'm gonna arrest Cordova.

289
00:17:44,409 --> 00:17:47,244
I'm in. One of us has got to
come out of this with our badge.

290
00:17:47,328 --> 00:17:48,695
All right?
Jimmy, I'm in.

291
00:17:48,746 --> 00:17:50,280
Hey, Jimmy.
What?

292
00:17:50,365 --> 00:17:53,233
I got an old speeding ticket
that Cordova never paid.

293
00:17:53,284 --> 00:17:54,735
Webb County. '97.

294
00:17:54,802 --> 00:17:56,536
I know it's a penny ante charge,
but it's something.

295
00:17:56,588 --> 00:17:58,605
Nice, Perez.

296
00:18:06,547 --> 00:18:07,814
Hello?

297
00:18:07,882 --> 00:18:11,385
Yeah. Okay, thanks.

298
00:18:11,452 --> 00:18:12,752
That was Bouf.

299
00:18:12,804 --> 00:18:13,987
TOG picked up a call.

300
00:18:14,055 --> 00:18:16,456
Cordova's having
his plane fueled.

301
00:18:16,524 --> 00:18:18,358
Bastards think they can
just fly down to Mexico

302
00:18:18,426 --> 00:18:19,693
and kill Annie, huh?

303
00:18:19,761 --> 00:18:21,862
There he is.
Let's cancel his flight.

304
00:18:27,819 --> 00:18:29,102
Get out of the car!

305
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:30,103
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

306
00:18:30,154 --> 00:18:31,938
Get out of your car!

307
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:33,156
My client stays in the vehicle.

308
00:18:33,241 --> 00:18:34,658
There's your warrant.
Now, get out of my way.

309
00:18:34,742 --> 00:18:36,410
Yo, Ricky Martin, back
in the car, brother.

310
00:18:36,461 --> 00:18:37,610
All right, go.

311
00:18:37,662 --> 00:18:39,246
I got them, come on.
An unpaid speeding ticket?

312
00:18:39,297 --> 00:18:40,631
You guys really are desperate.

313
00:18:40,715 --> 00:18:42,615
Put your hands on your head.

314
00:18:42,667 --> 00:18:44,001
I'll have him out
in 15 minutes.

315
00:18:44,085 --> 00:18:48,672
Yeah? Pablo Cordova,
you're under arrest.

316
00:18:48,756 --> 00:18:51,141
Let's go.

317
00:18:51,225 --> 00:18:52,792
Come on.

318
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,433
You been walking
around your cell?

319
00:20:22,501 --> 00:20:23,367
Stretching your legs,
like I told you?

320
00:20:23,435 --> 00:20:26,387
Yeah. Yeah.

321
00:20:26,471 --> 00:20:27,722
Good. Let's go.

322
00:20:27,806 --> 00:20:29,607
I'm scared.

323
00:20:32,694 --> 00:20:33,844
I am, too.

324
00:20:33,895 --> 00:20:36,180
Tim...

325
00:20:36,248 --> 00:20:38,849
It's time to go home.

326
00:20:38,917 --> 00:20:42,053
Okay.

327
00:20:43,405 --> 00:20:45,406
Okay. Close the door.

328
00:21:04,476 --> 00:21:06,510
♪ ♪

329
00:21:09,481 --> 00:21:11,482
Come on.

330
00:21:15,937 --> 00:21:17,888
Come here. Get down.

331
00:21:17,956 --> 00:21:19,523
Get down beside that car.
Stay down, Tim.

332
00:21:57,479 --> 00:21:58,946
Get in the car.

333
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,784
Tim.

334
00:22:06,872 --> 00:22:09,290
Hey, that was a smart move.

335
00:22:09,374 --> 00:22:10,958
Thank you.

336
00:22:11,042 --> 00:22:13,661
Pablo quiere
que ella este viva!

337
00:22:13,745 --> 00:22:14,712
You hear that?

338
00:22:14,779 --> 00:22:16,297
Get down.

339
00:22:32,264 --> 00:22:34,632
One disagreement and you
guys cut me out of the loop?

340
00:22:34,699 --> 00:22:36,100
What the hell are Jimmy
and Marco doing?

341
00:22:36,168 --> 00:22:37,168
I don't know what
you're talking about.

342
00:22:37,235 --> 00:22:38,486
Really?

343
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:40,354
'Cause I just got a call
from the acting U.S. Attorney.

344
00:22:40,438 --> 00:22:42,072
She said that Jimmy and Marco
arrested Cordova

345
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,073
and disappeared.

346
00:22:43,141 --> 00:22:45,242
Keep your voice down.

347
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:47,862
Look, Cordova's lawyer
is raising hell.

348
00:22:47,946 --> 00:22:50,197
Okay, he called
the Department of Justice

349
00:22:50,282 --> 00:22:51,866
and now the U.S. Attorney's
calling me,

350
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,317
and I don't like lying to her.

351
00:22:53,368 --> 00:22:54,318
How can you lie?

352
00:22:54,369 --> 00:22:55,686
You don't know anything.

353
00:22:55,754 --> 00:22:57,338
I know that Annie's
been kidnapped.

354
00:22:57,422 --> 00:23:00,291
You didn't tell her that.

355
00:23:01,593 --> 00:23:04,094
No, but maybe I should have.

356
00:23:05,297 --> 00:23:06,430
Just tell her to call Jimmy.

357
00:23:06,498 --> 00:23:10,234
She called Jimmy, okay,
and Marco and you.

358
00:23:10,302 --> 00:23:12,303
No one's answering.

359
00:23:13,471 --> 00:23:15,940
Look, Daisy, please,

360
00:23:16,007 --> 00:23:18,542
just tell me what's going on.

361
00:23:22,647 --> 00:23:24,448
Annie's been taken to Mexico.

362
00:23:24,515 --> 00:23:26,116
What?
She's being held

363
00:23:26,184 --> 00:23:28,219
until Cordova can get
across the border.

364
00:23:28,286 --> 00:23:29,887
He wants to kill her himself.

365
00:23:29,955 --> 00:23:31,521
Oh, my God.

366
00:23:31,573 --> 00:23:32,790
How long have you
known about this?

367
00:23:32,858 --> 00:23:33,958
Jimmy called me an hour ago.

368
00:23:34,025 --> 00:23:35,209
And you didn't think
I should know?

369
00:23:35,293 --> 00:23:36,227
You didn't think I could help?

370
00:23:36,294 --> 00:23:37,595
That's not what this is about.

371
00:23:37,662 --> 00:23:38,913
So what's Jimmy's plan?

372
00:23:38,997 --> 00:23:40,397
He's just going to
hold on to Cordova?

373
00:23:40,465 --> 00:23:41,465
How are we going to find Annie?

374
00:23:41,532 --> 00:23:43,634
Jimmy's questioning
Cordova right now.

375
00:23:43,702 --> 00:23:46,470
No, no, we can't
do it like this.

376
00:23:46,537 --> 00:23:48,706
Okay, we got to do
this the right way.

377
00:23:48,773 --> 00:23:50,224
I'm gonna call my father.
No,

378
00:23:50,308 --> 00:23:52,042
don't. He's got friends at the CIA.

379
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,110
If anyone can get
Annie out alive...

380
00:23:53,178 --> 00:23:55,980
If this turns into
an international incident,

381
00:23:56,047 --> 00:23:57,398
then Annie is dead.

382
00:23:57,482 --> 00:23:59,383
That's Jimmy talking.
He's right,

383
00:23:59,434 --> 00:24:02,820
so don't make me regret
telling you, Luke.

384
00:24:20,405 --> 00:24:22,573
Back in Narco,
I used to hear stories

385
00:24:22,641 --> 00:24:24,642
about how Cordova used
to torture people.

386
00:24:26,544 --> 00:24:29,914
The cartels corrupted
my partner.

387
00:24:29,981 --> 00:24:32,016
They deserve what they get.

388
00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:35,419
How come I never heard
about your partner, Marco?

389
00:24:35,487 --> 00:24:39,590
Because on the record,
he was a good cop

390
00:24:39,658 --> 00:24:40,925
shot in the line of duty.

391
00:24:40,992 --> 00:24:42,259
So you couldn't tell the truth?

392
00:24:42,327 --> 00:24:43,994
He had a family.

393
00:24:44,062 --> 00:24:45,312
If the truth came out...

394
00:24:45,397 --> 00:24:46,964
They wouldn't get
their benefits.

395
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:50,200
I visit them sometimes,

396
00:24:50,268 --> 00:24:53,304
tell the kids stories
about their dad.

397
00:24:56,875 --> 00:24:58,809
It's like I said,

398
00:24:58,877 --> 00:25:01,011
they deserve what they get.

399
00:25:25,904 --> 00:25:27,821
Hey.

400
00:25:27,906 --> 00:25:29,873
Annie didn't kill your family.

401
00:25:29,941 --> 00:25:31,942
The Satevo Cartel did.

402
00:25:32,994 --> 00:25:35,646
I'll deal with the Satevos.

403
00:25:35,714 --> 00:25:38,248
Not if I hand you over to 'em.

404
00:25:40,218 --> 00:25:42,152
You can't do that.

405
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,088
Oh, yeah?

406
00:25:44,155 --> 00:25:45,823
You're a U.S. Marshal.

407
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:47,191
Yeah?

408
00:25:49,878 --> 00:25:51,261
Hey.

409
00:25:52,597 --> 00:25:54,398
Have you heard
from your man Chavez lately?

410
00:25:54,466 --> 00:25:56,567
How do you think I know
that Annie's in Mexico?

411
00:26:01,139 --> 00:26:03,974
Okay.

412
00:26:04,025 --> 00:26:06,343
So long.

413
00:26:08,863 --> 00:26:10,581
Wait.

414
00:26:10,648 --> 00:26:12,399
Wait?

415
00:26:12,484 --> 00:26:13,400
Wait.

416
00:26:13,485 --> 00:26:15,152
What, what?

417
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:16,487
Give me a phone

418
00:26:16,538 --> 00:26:18,906
and I'll tell them
to let her go.

419
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:20,541
Oh, yeah?

420
00:26:20,625 --> 00:26:22,292
You'll tell them to kill her.

421
00:26:23,995 --> 00:26:25,746
You think I'm stupid?

422
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:28,165
You think I'm stupid?!

423
00:26:28,233 --> 00:26:30,868
You tell me where she is!

424
00:26:34,806 --> 00:26:36,223
Thanks...

425
00:26:36,307 --> 00:26:39,059
for getting me out back there.

426
00:26:39,144 --> 00:26:40,344
Don't thank me yet.

427
00:26:40,395 --> 00:26:42,212
We still got to get off
this road and switch cars.

428
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,731
Why?
Why not just keep driving?

429
00:26:43,815 --> 00:26:45,082
I chase fugitives for a living.

430
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:47,884
A known vehicle is
the easiest one to spot.

431
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:56,360
♪ ♪

432
00:26:56,411 --> 00:26:58,362
Hablas ingles?

433
00:26:58,413 --> 00:26:59,296
Some.

434
00:26:59,364 --> 00:27:01,064
You got a phone?

435
00:27:02,867 --> 00:27:05,569
What about a cell phone?

436
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,004
You got one of those,
I'll pay you.

437
00:27:07,071 --> 00:27:08,138
Only that phone.

438
00:27:08,206 --> 00:27:09,440
Sorry.

439
00:27:09,507 --> 00:27:10,707
Tim, grab some food,

440
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:11,875
whatever you want.

441
00:27:11,926 --> 00:27:14,812
I need you to show me where I...

442
00:27:17,132 --> 00:27:18,849
Get down.

443
00:27:18,917 --> 00:27:19,933
Tim.

444
00:27:26,791 --> 00:27:29,126
Damn it.

445
00:27:29,194 --> 00:27:30,127
Hide us.

446
00:27:30,195 --> 00:27:31,445
I don't want trouble, huh?

447
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,481
They find us in here...

448
00:27:36,034 --> 00:27:38,302
you die.

449
00:27:50,029 --> 00:27:52,930
Hola.

450
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,767
Estamos buscando
dos Americanos.

451
00:27:57,269 --> 00:27:58,837
Una rubia y un nino.

452
00:27:58,904 --> 00:28:00,638
Lo siento.

453
00:28:01,574 --> 00:28:03,107
No los he visto.

454
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,181
Cuatro paquetes de cigarrillos.

455
00:28:18,858 --> 00:28:23,394
Si usted los ve,
llama a la policia.

456
00:28:23,462 --> 00:28:25,180
Si, senor, claro.

457
00:28:43,666 --> 00:28:45,617
You okay?

458
00:28:45,668 --> 00:28:48,586
Yeah.

459
00:28:50,456 --> 00:28:51,673
You know those police work

460
00:28:51,757 --> 00:28:52,790
for the Allende Cartel.

461
00:28:52,842 --> 00:28:53,925
Of course.

462
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,212
You tell 'em we were here,

463
00:28:57,296 --> 00:28:58,897
they're going
to punish you for lying.

464
00:28:58,964 --> 00:29:00,331
I won't tell them.

465
00:29:02,368 --> 00:29:04,669
I need your car.

466
00:29:10,976 --> 00:29:12,193
Hey, Perez,

467
00:29:12,278 --> 00:29:13,878
what are you doing here?

468
00:29:13,946 --> 00:29:15,747
I'm meeting with Jimmy.
Jimmy's here?

469
00:29:19,368 --> 00:29:22,403
Hey, Daisy, can I see you
in the briefing room, please?

470
00:29:22,488 --> 00:29:23,588
Yeah.

471
00:29:23,656 --> 00:29:25,240
It's okay, we got it handled.

472
00:29:25,324 --> 00:29:26,374
Jimmy,

473
00:29:26,458 --> 00:29:29,694
he knows.

474
00:29:29,762 --> 00:29:30,862
So this is
where they're holding Annie...

475
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:33,097
in a compound
75 miles south of Laredo.

476
00:29:33,165 --> 00:29:35,333
Now that we have
her exact location,

477
00:29:35,384 --> 00:29:36,901
we can send our own people
to extract her.

478
00:29:36,969 --> 00:29:38,703
We're going to need the DEA
to send in a chopper, okay?

479
00:29:38,771 --> 00:29:40,037
Well, I got guys we can trust.

480
00:29:40,089 --> 00:29:41,039
I'll see how fast
they can mount a rescue.

481
00:29:41,106 --> 00:29:42,106
How fast can they move?

482
00:29:42,174 --> 00:29:43,207
Best case scenario...
eight to ten hours.

483
00:29:43,275 --> 00:29:45,059
No, that's not good enough.

484
00:29:45,144 --> 00:29:46,878
We're in a meeting.

485
00:29:46,946 --> 00:29:48,279
Deputy, I need you

486
00:29:48,347 --> 00:29:50,081
to answer some questions
about Pablo Cordova.

487
00:29:50,149 --> 00:29:51,566
Sure,

488
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:53,318
some other time.
Now.

489
00:29:57,489 --> 00:29:59,407
Annie.

490
00:29:59,491 --> 00:30:01,943
Damn it.

491
00:30:02,027 --> 00:30:03,244
Go back, please.

492
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,698
Okay, Calle Ruiz.

493
00:30:06,749 --> 00:30:08,950
Let's hope this goes north.

494
00:30:26,585 --> 00:30:28,586
A dead end.

495
00:30:30,522 --> 00:30:32,557
Yeah, we're going
to wait it out in there.

496
00:30:32,608 --> 00:30:33,641
We can't just break
into someone's house.

497
00:30:33,726 --> 00:30:35,059
Well, I doubt anybody
lives in there.

498
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:36,110
I'll take the car,

499
00:30:36,195 --> 00:30:38,813
put it around back,
check it out inside.

500
00:30:47,573 --> 00:30:49,574
Stay there.

501
00:31:04,173 --> 00:31:06,123
See?

502
00:31:06,175 --> 00:31:07,458
Told you it was empty.

503
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,795
Whoever it was left in a hurry.

504
00:31:22,491 --> 00:31:24,342
Where is Pablo Cordova?

505
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:26,110
Marco is booking him now.

506
00:31:26,178 --> 00:31:27,278
Where?

507
00:31:27,346 --> 00:31:28,680
In Webb County.

508
00:31:28,747 --> 00:31:30,148
He's driving him
halfway across Texas

509
00:31:30,215 --> 00:31:31,649
on a speeding ticket?

510
00:31:31,717 --> 00:31:33,017
Yeah, a warrant's a warrant.

511
00:31:33,085 --> 00:31:36,888
Deputy, what the hell
is going on here?

512
00:31:38,757 --> 00:31:40,825
Jimmy, you got a second?

513
00:31:40,893 --> 00:31:43,160
Yeah.

514
00:31:43,212 --> 00:31:45,013
Excuse me.

515
00:31:46,965 --> 00:31:48,049
Annie's on the phone.

516
00:31:50,686 --> 00:31:52,186
I thought we could make it
to the border.

517
00:31:52,271 --> 00:31:53,337
Did you say "we"?

518
00:31:53,405 --> 00:31:54,555
Yeah, I got someone with me...

519
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,723
Tim O'Neil.

520
00:31:55,808 --> 00:31:57,174
Dan O'Neil's son?

521
00:31:58,143 --> 00:31:59,861
They kidnapped his son.

522
00:31:59,945 --> 00:32:01,479
Reason the U.S. Attorney became
the cartel's mole.

523
00:32:01,547 --> 00:32:03,031
Yeah.

524
00:32:03,115 --> 00:32:05,183
Now they have a whole army
looking for us.

525
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:07,418
We pulled up Calle Ruiz on a map.

526
00:32:07,486 --> 00:32:08,903
We located your abandoned house.

527
00:32:08,987 --> 00:32:11,189
Please tell me there's
another road out of here.

528
00:32:11,256 --> 00:32:12,907
The only road is the one
you rode there on.

529
00:32:12,991 --> 00:32:14,258
Can you stay where you are

530
00:32:14,326 --> 00:32:15,226
until we get people to you?

531
00:32:15,294 --> 00:32:16,360
How long?

532
00:32:16,428 --> 00:32:17,628
Eight to ten hours.

533
00:32:18,664 --> 00:32:20,832
I don't know, guys.

534
00:32:20,899 --> 00:32:22,500
Uh, if they saw us

535
00:32:22,551 --> 00:32:24,702
turn down this road...
I'll get you out in four.

536
00:32:24,753 --> 00:32:25,703
Four?

537
00:32:25,754 --> 00:32:27,505
Yeah, four.

538
00:32:27,573 --> 00:32:29,107
Okay.

539
00:32:29,174 --> 00:32:30,508
See you then.

540
00:32:30,576 --> 00:32:33,010
And, um, Jimmy...
Yeah?

541
00:32:33,078 --> 00:32:35,546
These don't count
as vacation days.

542
00:32:35,614 --> 00:32:36,981
All right.

543
00:32:39,318 --> 00:32:42,219
How the hell are you going to
get her out in four hours?

544
00:32:42,271 --> 00:32:44,021
You can't keep
breaking the law!

545
00:32:44,089 --> 00:32:47,258
Right now the law's not
the most important thing.

546
00:33:00,038 --> 00:33:01,773
How many of those
things you eating?

547
00:33:02,841 --> 00:33:04,876
Want one?

548
00:33:04,943 --> 00:33:06,711
No.

549
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:10,281
Thank you.

550
00:33:10,349 --> 00:33:11,349
Hmm?

551
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:19,824
Do you think...

552
00:33:19,892 --> 00:33:23,027
I could call my Dad?

553
00:33:23,095 --> 00:33:24,495
On that phone?

554
00:33:24,563 --> 00:33:26,147
Tim, I already told you...

555
00:33:26,231 --> 00:33:27,932
it'd just worry him.

556
00:33:27,983 --> 00:33:29,300
We'll call him when we get back.

557
00:33:31,336 --> 00:33:32,804
What if we don't get out?

558
00:33:32,871 --> 00:33:35,373
Please, can I just call him now?

559
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:42,330
Listen, I got something
to tell you.

560
00:33:43,982 --> 00:33:46,918
I do know your dad.

561
00:33:46,985 --> 00:33:49,086
I work with him.

562
00:33:49,154 --> 00:33:51,255
Why didn't you tell me?

563
00:33:51,323 --> 00:33:55,059
I got some bad news about him.

564
00:33:56,094 --> 00:33:58,429
Is he all right?

565
00:34:00,999 --> 00:34:03,868
He was arrested a few days ago.

566
00:34:04,903 --> 00:34:06,671
Why? He...
Tim...

567
00:34:06,738 --> 00:34:09,106
the Allendes kidnapped you

568
00:34:09,174 --> 00:34:12,310
to force your dad to help them.

569
00:34:12,377 --> 00:34:13,644
And he did.

570
00:34:13,695 --> 00:34:15,997
No, he's...
You-you're lying.

571
00:34:16,081 --> 00:34:17,665
No, I just wanted you to know,

572
00:34:17,749 --> 00:34:19,350
'cause when you go back,
you're going to hear

573
00:34:19,418 --> 00:34:20,718
some pretty ugly things.

574
00:34:20,786 --> 00:34:24,055
I wanted you to learn
it from a friend first.

575
00:34:26,091 --> 00:34:27,558
Is he in jail?

576
00:34:28,961 --> 00:34:30,595
Is he?

577
00:34:35,634 --> 00:34:37,301
No, Tim.

578
00:34:37,352 --> 00:34:39,169
Damn it! Damn! No, no.

Okay, okay, okay, okay.

585
00:34:51,033 --> 00:34:52,900
Listen, hey. I'm sorry.

586
00:34:52,985 --> 00:34:53,901
Come on.

587
00:34:53,986 --> 00:34:55,286
We got to get back inside.

588

Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

590

I don't want to die.

591
00:35:21,019 --> 00:35:23,570
Go get in the bathtub.
Lie down flat. What?

592
00:35:23,637 --> 00:35:25,972
It's the safest place to be if
the shooting starts happening.

593
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,774

Just go!

In return...

evidence you need

You will deliver it to the DEA.

614
00:37:25,259 --> 00:37:28,929
You want us to wipe out
your competition for you.

615
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:33,783
This time, Cordova won't have
any witnesses to kill.
