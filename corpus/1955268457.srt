2
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,809
Jay,
Breakfast Is Ready!

3
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:42,462
Be Down
In A Second, Mom!

4
00:00:59,462 --> 00:01:00,763
Hey, Morning, Mom.

5
00:01:00,763 --> 00:01:01,031
Morning, Sweetie.

6
00:01:02,031 --> 00:01:03,867
Hey, I Had This
Tight Dream Last Night

7
00:01:03,867 --> 00:01:05,002
That You Made Me
French Toast And Bacon.

8
00:01:06,002 --> 00:01:07,837
You're Good.

9
00:01:07,837 --> 00:01:09,339
Listen, Honey,
I Got A Call

10
00:01:09,339 --> 00:01:10,840
From Aunt Lois
This Morning.

11
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,475
She Is In The Hospital.

12
00:01:12,475 --> 00:01:14,477
What Happened?

13
00:01:14,477 --> 00:01:16,279
Broke Her Ankle.

14
00:01:16,279 --> 00:01:18,681
Heh! Again?

15
00:01:18,681 --> 00:01:20,383
The Other Ankle.

16
00:01:20,383 --> 00:01:22,819
That Woman Was Not
Meant To Ski.

17
00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:24,021
Well, Is She
Gonna Be Ok?

18
00:01:25,021 --> 00:01:26,689
Mmm, She'll Be Fine,

19
00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:28,291
But She Just Can't
Get Around.

20
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:30,293
I'm Gonna Have To
Go Down There,

21
00:01:30,293 --> 00:01:32,162
And I'll Probably
Have To Stay About A Week.

22
00:01:32,162 --> 00:01:34,031
No Problem, Mom,
I Can Take Care Of Myself,

23
00:01:35,031 --> 00:01:37,200
And Don't Say
I'm Too Young.

24
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,069
Fine, But Just So
You're Not Lonely,

25
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:41,371
I've Spoken
With Your Brother

26
00:01:41,371 --> 00:01:43,406
And He's Agreed To Come
Down From Starkwell

27
00:01:43,406 --> 00:01:44,674
To Keep You Company.

28
00:01:44,674 --> 00:01:47,510
Mom! Come On,
Give Me A Break!

29
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:48,711
Mike's Just Gonna
Yell At Me

30
00:01:48,711 --> 00:01:50,380
And Boss Me Around
All Day.

31
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,581
He Hates Me.

32
00:01:51,581 --> 00:01:53,017
No, He Doesn't.
He Worries About You.

33
00:01:54,017 --> 00:01:56,553
It's Just How
He Shows He Cares.

34
00:01:56,553 --> 00:01:57,587
Well, I'd Be
A Whole Lot Happier

35
00:01:57,587 --> 00:01:59,522
If He Cared Just
A Little Bit Less.

36
00:01:59,522 --> 00:02:01,925
Heh! Look, I'm Gonna
Leave You Enough Money

37
00:02:01,925 --> 00:02:03,593
To Get You
Through Next Week.

38
00:02:03,593 --> 00:02:06,362
There Are Frozen Dinners
In The Freezer.

39
00:02:06,362 --> 00:02:09,499
Use The Money To Buy
Some Healthy Food.

40
00:02:09,499 --> 00:02:11,701
Don't Just Eat Junk Food
All Week, Ok?

41
00:02:11,701 --> 00:02:14,170
Ok. Just 5 Days
Out Of 7.

42
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:16,739
Listen, I'm Sorry

43
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:19,542
I'm Going To Miss The Awards Ceremony Tonight.

44
00:02:19,542 --> 00:02:22,178
It's Ok, Mom.
I Haven't Won Yet.

45
00:02:22,178 --> 00:02:24,948
And Who Knows-- You Might Not Be Missing Anything.

46
00:02:24,948 --> 00:02:26,683
I May Stink
Out Loud Today.

47
00:02:26,683 --> 00:02:28,018
I Doubt That,

48
00:02:29,018 --> 00:02:32,188
But No Matter
What Happens...

49
00:02:32,188 --> 00:02:36,259
I Am Very, Very
Proud Of You.

50
00:02:36,259 --> 00:02:39,864
And I Know Your Dad Would Be Twice As Proud.

51
00:02:41,864 --> 00:02:43,933
Mom...

52
00:02:43,933 --> 00:02:45,735
You Don't Think Dad Would've Been Disappointed

53
00:02:45,735 --> 00:02:47,704
If I Didn't Go
To Starkwell, Do You?

54
00:02:47,704 --> 00:02:51,409
You Just Win That Scholarship To Peterson.

55
00:03:02,418 --> 00:03:04,487
Forward March!

56
00:03:04,487 --> 00:03:08,324
Left! Left!
Left, Right, Left!

57
00:03:08,324 --> 00:03:12,061
Left! Left!
Left, Right, Left!

58
00:03:12,061 --> 00:03:13,830
Left, Left,

59
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,066
Platoon, Halt!

60
00:03:17,066 --> 00:03:20,336
Right Face!

61
00:03:20,336 --> 00:03:23,407
Parade Rest!

62
00:03:24,407 --> 00:03:26,476
Now, Gentlemen,

63
00:03:26,476 --> 00:03:29,479
You Are The Sorriest Bunch
Of Invertebrates

64
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:32,081
It Has Ever Been
My Displeasure

65
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:34,250
To Be In Command Of!

66
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,920
Your Bunks This Morning
Were Ridiculous!

67
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,089
If You Want To Be
Starkwell Men

68
00:03:40,089 --> 00:03:42,258
You Have Got To Do
Better Than That!

69
00:03:42,258 --> 00:03:43,926
Sergeant Martin?

70
00:03:43,926 --> 00:03:46,698
Attention!

71
00:03:48,698 --> 00:03:52,675
Colonel Douglas Wants
To See You Asap.

72
00:03:58,675 --> 00:04:02,278
Platoon... Dismissed!

73
00:04:02,278 --> 00:04:05,048
Starkwell!

74
00:04:05,048 --> 00:04:08,051
Yes,
All Right, Sir.

75
00:04:08,051 --> 00:04:10,521
You Wanted
To See Me, Sir?

76
00:04:11,521 --> 00:04:13,189
Cadet Martin,
I Understand Your Squad

77
00:04:13,189 --> 00:04:14,857
Is Close To Failing
The Semester.

78
00:04:14,857 --> 00:04:16,392
It's Not My Fault.

79
00:04:16,392 --> 00:04:17,827
The Guys
Are Just Lazy.

80
00:04:17,827 --> 00:04:19,162
The Squad's
Grades Are Down

81
00:04:19,162 --> 00:04:20,730
Because Of Them,
Not Me, Sir.

82
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,498
At Ease, Mike.

83
00:04:22,498 --> 00:04:24,500
Listen, Son, You Work
Hard Around Here.

84
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,369
You Know Your Regulations
Forwards And Backwards,

85
00:04:26,369 --> 00:04:28,671
But You Don't Know Jack
About Being A Leader.

86
00:04:28,671 --> 00:04:30,707
Being A Leader Is More Than Just Yelling And Screaming

87
00:04:30,707 --> 00:04:33,242
And Blaming Everything
On Everybody Else.

88
00:04:33,242 --> 00:04:35,745
These Men Are
Like Your Brothers.

89
00:04:35,745 --> 00:04:38,815
Listen, When Your Dad Taught Here,
He Told Me Something.

90
00:04:38,815 --> 00:04:41,351
He Said,
"A Man Will Follow Orders If He Fears You,

91
00:04:41,351 --> 00:04:43,986
But He'll Save Your Life If He Loves And Respects You."

92
00:04:43,986 --> 00:04:47,523
Now, Captain Pennick Told Me
About Your Situation At Home.

93
00:04:47,523 --> 00:04:49,492
I Suggest You Take
This Time Off

94
00:04:49,492 --> 00:04:51,594
And You Seriously Think
About Whether Or Not

95
00:04:51,594 --> 00:04:54,397
You're Suited For A Career
In The Military,

96
00:04:54,397 --> 00:04:57,066
And Believe Me, Son,
It's Not For Everyone.

97
00:05:13,049 --> 00:05:15,718
Excuse Me. Hand It Over!

98
00:05:15,718 --> 00:05:17,253
This Is A School,
Not A Video Arcade.

99
00:05:17,253 --> 00:05:18,688
Why Do You Think
Your Grades Are Down?

100
00:05:18,688 --> 00:05:20,923
I'm Keeping This.
You Won't Get It Back Till Next Semester,

101
00:05:20,923 --> 00:05:22,225
If You Get It
Back At All.

102
00:05:22,225 --> 00:05:24,394
Hey, Who's The Lucky Kid Van
Dusen's Picking On Today?

103
00:05:24,394 --> 00:05:25,028
Nina Morris.

104
00:05:26,028 --> 00:05:27,030
She's In My Little
Brother's Class.

105
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,132
She's Really Nice.

106
00:05:29,132 --> 00:05:31,200
They Always Are.

107
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,540
Bombs Away!

108
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,041
Heh Heh Heh!

109
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:40,610
Ugh!

110
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:42,215
Uh, That Was Me.

111
00:05:46,215 --> 00:05:49,085
Meanwhile,
The Privileged Few

112
00:05:49,085 --> 00:05:50,653
Continue To Get Away
With Anything.

113
00:05:50,653 --> 00:05:53,489
It's Unfair
With A Capital "U".

114
00:05:53,489 --> 00:05:54,658
Oh!

115
00:05:55,658 --> 00:05:57,260
Check These Out.

116
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,397
It's My Newest One.

117
00:06:06,269 --> 00:06:08,840
That's Great, Jay.

118
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,308
Let Me See That.

119
00:06:12,308 --> 00:06:13,342
Hey, Be Careful
With Those.

120
00:06:13,342 --> 00:06:15,445
My Presentation
Is On The Other Side.

121
00:06:15,445 --> 00:06:17,014
Morn--

122
00:06:18,014 --> 00:06:19,482
Morning, People.

123
00:06:19,482 --> 00:06:23,486
I'm Gonna Try And Keep It Brief This Morning.

124
00:06:23,486 --> 00:06:27,089
We Have Just 2 Items
Of Business To Attend To.

125
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:29,692
First, If Any Of You
Had The Spanish Rice

126
00:06:29,692 --> 00:06:31,527
For Lunch Yesterday,

127
00:06:31,527 --> 00:06:33,696
Please See Nurse Ketcham
If You're Feeling...

128
00:06:33,696 --> 00:06:34,964
Different.

129
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:39,035
Second, All Eighth Graders
Should Report

130
00:06:39,035 --> 00:06:40,336
To The Auditorium
For Fifth Period

131
00:06:40,336 --> 00:06:43,339
For The Donald Peterson
Memorial Award Competition.

132
00:06:43,339 --> 00:06:44,841
All The Finalists
For The Award

133
00:06:44,841 --> 00:06:47,276
Will Be Called Up
Onto The Stage.

134
00:06:47,276 --> 00:06:48,344
I Want To Thank You
For Your Time.

135
00:06:48,344 --> 00:06:49,378
Have A Nice Day,
And, Oh,

136
00:06:49,378 --> 00:06:50,546
Let's Try
And Stuff Our Brains

137
00:06:50,546 --> 00:06:53,282
With Things We Don't That
Already Know, Shall We?

138
00:06:57,487 --> 00:06:59,155
This Is So Cool.

139
00:06:59,155 --> 00:07:00,359
Watch This!

140
00:07:03,359 --> 00:07:04,527
Jay, Are You Ok?

141
00:07:04,527 --> 00:07:06,629
That Tickle,
Buddy? Ha Ha!

142
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:08,865
Ronny! Enough
With The Soccer!

143
00:07:08,865 --> 00:07:10,199
Get To Class!

144
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:12,504
Later, Guys.

145
00:07:14,504 --> 00:07:16,706
Hurry Up And Collect
Those, Mr. Martin.

146
00:07:16,706 --> 00:07:19,242
Uh-Oh, Jay.

147
00:07:19,242 --> 00:07:21,884
No Problem,
Mr. Van Dusen.

148
00:07:27,884 --> 00:07:30,588
Not A Very Flattering
Likeness Of Me.

149
00:07:32,588 --> 00:07:34,390
Oh!

150
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:36,926
Oh, That's Not You,
Mr. Van Dusen.

151
00:07:36,926 --> 00:07:39,029
Perhaps We Should Discuss Your
Artistic Endeavors With Your Mother.

152
00:07:40,029 --> 00:07:42,432
Give Me The Rest.

153
00:07:43,432 --> 00:07:45,501
But, Mr. Van Dusen,
I Need Those.

154
00:07:45,501 --> 00:07:47,537
My Presentation
Is On The Other Side.

155
00:07:47,537 --> 00:07:48,871
At The Risk Of Sounding
Like I'm Saying,

156
00:07:48,871 --> 00:07:50,540
"You Should Have Thought
Of That Before,"

157
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,042
Well, You Should Have
Thought Of That Before!

158
00:07:53,042 --> 00:07:55,012
You'll Have To Rewrite Them
On More Appropriate Cards.

159
00:07:56,012 --> 00:07:58,682
Bad Attitude.

160
00:07:59,682 --> 00:08:01,250
But I Can't
Believe This!

161
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,919
I'm Dead!
There's No Time

162
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:05,688
To Write Out That Whole Presentation Over Again.

163
00:08:05,688 --> 00:08:08,357
People,
How Are We, Hmm?

164
00:08:08,357 --> 00:08:10,593
We're Busy Here,
Ronny.

165
00:08:10,593 --> 00:08:12,228
So, Uh...

166
00:08:12,228 --> 00:08:13,563
So, Martian, I Hear

167
00:08:13,563 --> 00:08:15,798
You're My Main Competition For The Scholarship.

168
00:08:15,798 --> 00:08:17,400
That's Not
His Name,

169
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,068
And If You're
His Competition

170
00:08:19,068 --> 00:08:20,803
I Wouldn't Call It Very Competitive.

171
00:08:20,803 --> 00:08:22,405
Can It, Jerk.

172
00:08:22,405 --> 00:08:24,740
Anyway... Hey, Hi.

173
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,943
Yeah, I Wanted
To Invite You

174
00:08:26,943 --> 00:08:29,545
To A Little Victory
Party That I'm Throwing

175
00:08:29,545 --> 00:08:32,114
After I Win The
Donald Peterson Award.

176
00:08:32,114 --> 00:08:35,752
I'm Throwing A Little Victory Bash In My Pool House.

177
00:08:36,752 --> 00:08:38,454
I'm Busy.

178
00:08:38,454 --> 00:08:40,623
I Wasn't Talking
To You.

179
00:08:40,623 --> 00:08:41,624
Hope To See You
There, Trace.

180
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:46,733
Gentlemen.

181
00:08:50,733 --> 00:08:53,936
Don't Worry.
You're Gonna Mop Up The Floor With Him.

182
00:08:53,936 --> 00:08:55,805
The Only Downside
Is That We Won't Get

183
00:08:55,805 --> 00:08:57,740
To Go To The Party
At His Pool House.

184
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,308
Way To Be
Supportive.

185
00:08:59,308 --> 00:09:02,078
I'm Serious!
That Pool House Is Amazing.

186
00:09:02,078 --> 00:09:04,580
It's Like He's Got
His Own Place.

187
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,016
He's Got His Own Phone With His Own Number.

188
00:09:07,016 --> 00:09:09,852
It's Got A Pool Table,
Video Games.

189
00:09:09,852 --> 00:09:12,688
I Hear It Even
Has A Pool.

190
00:09:12,688 --> 00:09:14,024
Ok, Class,
Let's Get To Work.

191
00:09:16,859 --> 00:09:18,699
Ha Ha! Ooh!

192
00:09:23,699 --> 00:09:25,801
You Wanted To Speak
To Me, Dad?

193
00:09:25,801 --> 00:09:28,170
Are You Prepared
For This Presentation?

194
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,473
Oh, Yeah, Yeah.

195
00:09:30,473 --> 00:09:33,275
I've Got The Winning
Speech Right Here.

196
00:09:33,275 --> 00:09:35,044
It's Not That Ridiculous Idea You Had

197
00:09:35,044 --> 00:09:37,680
Why Jackie Chan Would Make
A Cool President, Is It?

198
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,548
Uh...

199
00:09:39,548 --> 00:09:41,851
Look, You,

200
00:09:41,851 --> 00:09:42,952
Your Grandfather
Doesn't Think

201
00:09:42,952 --> 00:09:44,520
I'm Doing A Good Job
Of Raising You.

202
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,621
He Also Doesn't Think
You Have A Chance

203
00:09:45,621 --> 00:09:46,956
Of Winning That
Scholarship, And Frankly,

204
00:09:46,956 --> 00:09:48,658
On That Account,
I Tend To Agree With Him.

205
00:09:48,658 --> 00:09:50,693
We Have To Prove
Old Armand Wrong.

206
00:09:50,693 --> 00:09:52,061
We Have To Win
That Scholarship.

207
00:09:52,061 --> 00:09:53,295
Now Jay Martin Has

208
00:09:53,295 --> 00:09:55,364
An Incredible Presentation On Recycling

209
00:09:55,364 --> 00:09:57,400
That's Well Thought Out
And Impeccably Worded.

210
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,535
You Have
About 20 Minutes

211
00:09:59,535 --> 00:10:02,304
To Come Up With A Better Presentation Than His.

212
00:10:02,304 --> 00:10:04,874
I Have To Meet With The Food Services People.

213
00:10:04,874 --> 00:10:08,310
I Have To Sweep This Spanish
Rice Thing Under The Carpet.

214
00:10:25,394 --> 00:10:27,866
Recycling, Huh?

215
00:10:30,866 --> 00:10:32,068
I Don't Get It.

216
00:10:32,068 --> 00:10:34,937
Peterson Is Less Expensive Than Starkwell.

217
00:10:34,937 --> 00:10:36,172
Why Would You Have To
Go To Starkwell

218
00:10:36,172 --> 00:10:37,840
If You Don't Want To?

219
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,742
Well, My Mom Can't
Afford Either One,

220
00:10:39,742 --> 00:10:41,277
But My Dad Taught
At Starkwell,

221
00:10:41,277 --> 00:10:43,612
So We Can Get In
For Practically Nothing.

222
00:10:43,612 --> 00:10:45,015
The Competition's
Not For 15 Minutes.

223
00:10:46,015 --> 00:10:48,684
Try And Do Your Presentation For Us From Memory.

224
00:10:48,684 --> 00:10:51,620
I--I Don't Think I Can.

225
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,092
Just Try.

226
00:10:56,092 --> 00:10:59,128
All Right.

227
00:10:59,128 --> 00:11:01,464
Here Goes.

228
00:11:01,464 --> 00:11:03,568
Good Afternoon.

229
00:11:05,568 --> 00:11:08,538
Today I Want To Talk
To You About Garbage.

230
00:11:09,538 --> 00:11:12,742
Each Year,
Americans Produce Enough Trash And Refuse

231
00:11:12,742 --> 00:11:14,043
To Fill
A Convoy Of Trucks

232
00:11:14,043 --> 00:11:15,314
That Would Reach
Halfway To The Moon.

233
00:11:18,314 --> 00:11:22,284
Each Year Americans
Produce Enough Trash

234
00:11:22,284 --> 00:11:25,121
And Ref--Refuse...

235
00:11:25,121 --> 00:11:27,156
Refuse To Fill

236
00:11:27,156 --> 00:11:29,425
A Convoy Of Trucks

237
00:11:29,425 --> 00:11:31,961
That Would Reach
Halfway To The Moon,

238
00:11:31,961 --> 00:11:33,829
And It Is Estimated

239
00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:35,331
That Within The Century

240
00:11:35,331 --> 00:11:37,666
We Will Run Out
Of Landfill

241
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:39,071
To Handle Our Waste.

242
00:11:42,071 --> 00:11:44,073
Man, How Am I Supposed
To Get Up There

243
00:11:44,073 --> 00:11:47,076
And Give The Exact Same Speech Right After Ronny?

244
00:11:47,076 --> 00:11:48,611
I'd Look
Like An Idiot.

245
00:11:48,611 --> 00:11:50,346
Well, Why Didn't
You Say Something?

246
00:11:50,346 --> 00:11:52,015
I Don't Have Any Proof.
What's The Use?

247
00:11:53,015 --> 00:11:54,483
What's The Use?

248
00:11:54,483 --> 00:11:57,419
You'd Be Going To Peterson
Academy With Me Next Year.

249
00:11:57,419 --> 00:11:59,155
Remember Peterson,

250
00:11:59,155 --> 00:12:01,457
The One With The Really Great Art Program?

251
00:12:01,457 --> 00:12:03,292
Or You Could
Just Settle

252
00:12:03,292 --> 00:12:04,627
For The All-Boy
Military Academy

253
00:12:04,627 --> 00:12:05,028
Upstate
With Your Brother.

254
00:12:06,028 --> 00:12:08,497
Hey, Tough Break On That
Scholarship, Martian,

255
00:12:08,497 --> 00:12:11,500
But I Guess
The Best Man Won.

256
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,035
How Does It Feel
To Know That You Won

257
00:12:13,035 --> 00:12:14,670
Using My Presentation?

258
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,839
What? Yeah, Right,

259
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:18,374
You Big Liar!

260
00:12:18,374 --> 00:12:20,676
Don't Be A Sore
Loser, Martian.

261
00:12:20,676 --> 00:12:22,311
You'll Have Fun
At The Army Academy.

262
00:12:22,311 --> 00:12:24,180
You'll Look Cute Bald.

263
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,016
Oh, Hope To See You
At My Party Next Week.

264
00:12:27,016 --> 00:12:29,718
Don't Hold Your Breath, Cheater.

265
00:12:29,718 --> 00:12:32,288
It's About My Wife Eliza Van Dusen's Dog.

266
00:12:32,288 --> 00:12:33,489
The Pomeranian?

267
00:12:33,489 --> 00:12:34,824
Yes, Her Name
Is Camille.

268
00:12:34,824 --> 00:12:36,292
Can You Hold,
Please?

269
00:12:36,292 --> 00:12:37,196
Yes, I'll Hold.

270
00:12:40,196 --> 00:12:42,698
Ought To Be Ashamed Charging
That Much For A Candy Bar.

271
00:12:42,698 --> 00:12:46,402
Oh, I'll Get One.
There We Go.

272
00:12:46,402 --> 00:12:48,470
Yeah, Yeah.

273
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,039
Mr. Van Dusen?

274
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:52,575
Martin, Was It?
Make It Snappy, I'm On Hold.

275
00:12:52,575 --> 00:12:55,744
It--It's About
The Presentations.

276
00:12:55,744 --> 00:12:57,746
Um, I Think
There's Been--

277
00:12:57,746 --> 00:12:59,381
Mr. Van Dusen?

278
00:12:59,381 --> 00:13:00,016
Don't Ever Put Me
On Hold Again!

279
00:13:01,016 --> 00:13:02,051
Do You Have
Any Idea Who I Am?

280
00:13:02,051 --> 00:13:03,385
I'm Sorry, Sir.

281
00:13:03,385 --> 00:13:05,855
I Wanted The Nails Trimmed On All 4 Paws.

282
00:13:05,855 --> 00:13:07,056
The Nails
On The Front Paws

283
00:13:07,056 --> 00:13:08,324
Were Long Enough
To Play The Piano.

284
00:13:08,324 --> 00:13:10,492
I'm Bringing Camille
Back In Tomorrow.

285
00:13:10,492 --> 00:13:13,195
Am I Making Myself
Clear? Thank You!

286
00:13:13,195 --> 00:13:14,930
Walk With Me.

287
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:17,700
Whatever You Do,
Don't Get Yourself A Show Dog, Martin.

288
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,734
With The Amount
Of Money I Spend

289
00:13:18,734 --> 00:13:20,202
On My Wife's Mutt
Every Year

290
00:13:20,202 --> 00:13:24,073
I Could Probably Send 5 Kids To Peterson Academy.

291
00:13:24,073 --> 00:13:25,274
Um, Sir--

292
00:13:25,274 --> 00:13:27,710
Sorry About That Scholarship,
By The Way.

293
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:30,412
Couldn't Be There Myself For The Presentation.

294
00:13:30,412 --> 00:13:33,850
The Spanish Rice Problem Spread To The Hash Browns.

295
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,585
Yeah, Um,

296
00:13:36,585 --> 00:13:39,255
It's--It's About
The Scholarship, Sir.

297
00:13:39,255 --> 00:13:42,925
It Seems Ronny Somehow
Wound Up With My Presentation.

298
00:13:42,925 --> 00:13:44,693
I Can Certainly Understand How You'd Be Upset

299
00:13:44,693 --> 00:13:46,061
At Not Winning
That Scholarship,

300
00:13:46,061 --> 00:13:47,396
But To Accuse
Another Student

301
00:13:47,396 --> 00:13:48,564
Of Cheating,
That's, Well--

302
00:13:48,564 --> 00:13:50,432
I'm Sure
You're Well Aware

303
00:13:50,432 --> 00:13:52,902
Of The Columbus Hall
Stance On Cheating.

304
00:13:52,902 --> 00:13:55,037
They're Against It?

305
00:13:55,037 --> 00:13:56,272
Very Much So.

306
00:13:56,272 --> 00:13:58,540
Our School Creed,
Written By Our Founder

307
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:01,210
Armand Columbus,
My Father-In-Law By The Way,

308
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:04,981
Includes The Phrase,
"Steadfast In All That Is True."

309
00:14:05,981 --> 00:14:07,816
You Know That Means,
Don't You?

310
00:14:07,816 --> 00:14:09,718
It's Anti-Cheating.

311
00:14:09,718 --> 00:14:10,886
That's Right.

312
00:14:10,886 --> 00:14:12,922
Isn't It Possible
The Two Of You

313
00:14:12,922 --> 00:14:15,057
Just Came Up
With Similar Ideas?

314
00:14:15,057 --> 00:14:17,893
It's Just That
Ronny's Presentation

315
00:14:17,893 --> 00:14:21,398
Was Word For Word
Exactly Like Mine.

316
00:14:22,398 --> 00:14:24,800
Didn't The Judges
Say Anything?

317
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,669
W-Well, No, Sir.

318
00:14:26,669 --> 00:14:28,070
See, I Didn't Give
My Presentation

319
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:30,606
Because I Didn't Have
My Materials.

320
00:14:30,606 --> 00:14:32,608
You Took Them, Remember?

321
00:14:32,608 --> 00:14:33,009
That's Right,

322
00:14:34,009 --> 00:14:35,511
And I Had Them
Destroyed.

323
00:14:35,511 --> 00:14:39,248
So There--Ronny Couldn't Have Taken Your Materials.

324
00:14:39,248 --> 00:14:43,853
C-Could You Maybe
Just Ask Ronny About It?

325
00:14:44,853 --> 00:14:46,455
Fine, I'll Ask.

326
00:14:48,524 --> 00:14:49,524
Mrs. Pintuff?

327
00:14:48,524 --> 00:14:49,858
Yes, Sir?

328
00:14:49,858 --> 00:14:51,694
Call Ronny To My Office, Please.

329
00:14:51,694 --> 00:14:53,629
Ronny Van Dusen...

330
00:14:53,629 --> 00:14:54,697
I'll Try To Get To The Bottom Of This.

331
00:14:54,697 --> 00:14:55,831
In The Meantime,
Let's Not Go Around

332
00:14:55,831 --> 00:14:58,369
Spreading Any Unsubstantiated Rumors.

333
00:15:00,369 --> 00:15:02,039
Ronny, In My Office.

334
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:05,541
Uh, Excuse Me.
I'm Going To Need

335
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,476
A Hall Pass To Get
Back To Class.

336
00:15:07,476 --> 00:15:09,278
Oh, Uh, Yeah.

337
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:11,714
Uh, I've Got A Bunch
Here Somewhere.

338
00:15:11,714 --> 00:15:13,515
Hmm! At Least
I Should Have

339
00:15:13,515 --> 00:15:16,151
A Bunch Here Somewhere...

340
00:15:16,151 --> 00:15:17,720
But You Never Know.
I Have Been Missing

341
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,022
A Lot Of Hall Passes
Lately.

342
00:15:20,022 --> 00:15:21,024
Oh, I'm Gonna Go
Borrow One From Mr. Novak.

343
00:15:22,024 --> 00:15:22,025
All Right.

344
00:15:23,025 --> 00:15:24,059
Ooh! Heh Heh! I Do
That All The Time.

345
00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:25,894
I'll Be Right Back.

346
00:15:25,894 --> 00:15:27,629
Thanks.

347
00:15:27,629 --> 00:15:28,864
Did You Steal

348
00:15:28,864 --> 00:15:31,400
Jay Martin's
Presentation?

349
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,403
You Told Me
To Win The Dumb Award.

350
00:15:34,403 --> 00:15:36,405
This Is A New Low,
Even For You.

351
00:15:36,405 --> 00:15:38,841
Did You Honestly Think
The Martin Kid

352
00:15:38,841 --> 00:15:39,842
Wasn't Gonna Notice?

353
00:15:39,842 --> 00:15:41,377
Well, I Thought
About It, See?

354
00:15:41,377 --> 00:15:43,812
See, But I Gave My Presentation Before He Did,

355
00:15:43,812 --> 00:15:45,514
And I Knew He Wasn't
Gonna Get Up There

356
00:15:45,514 --> 00:15:47,516
And Do The Exact
Same Presentation.

357
00:15:47,516 --> 00:15:50,419
Pretty Smart,
Huh? Ohh.

358
00:15:50,419 --> 00:15:51,520
Where Are His Cards?

359
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,721
Oh, I Left Them
In My Locker.

360
00:15:52,721 --> 00:15:54,723
I Didn't Use Them.
I Copied Them Over.

361
00:15:54,723 --> 00:15:56,392
I Want You To Get Rid
Of Those Cards.

362
00:15:56,392 --> 00:15:57,593
I Don't Want
Any Evidence

363
00:15:57,593 --> 00:15:59,728
Linking A Van Dusen
To Cheating.

364
00:15:59,728 --> 00:16:03,532
You Understand? Pronto!
You Must Be Out Of Your Mind.

365
00:16:03,532 --> 00:16:05,167
Can I Go Now?

366
00:16:05,167 --> 00:16:06,535
One More Thing
We Need To Talk About.

367
00:16:06,535 --> 00:16:08,337
These!

368
00:16:08,337 --> 00:16:09,571
They Look Like
Detention Slips.

369
00:16:09,571 --> 00:16:12,374
Uh-Huh.

370
00:16:12,374 --> 00:16:15,077
Uh, Are They Mine?

371
00:16:15,077 --> 00:16:16,612
Your Mother's Been Complaining To Your Grandfather

372
00:16:16,612 --> 00:16:18,047
That You're
Out Of Control.

373
00:16:18,047 --> 00:16:19,782
You Mess Up One More
Time, Mister,

374
00:16:19,782 --> 00:16:22,218
And There's Going To Be
Dire Consequences.

375
00:16:23,218 --> 00:16:25,218
Dire!

376
00:16:23,218 --> 00:16:25,896
Ok, I Got You.

377
00:16:33,896 --> 00:16:36,565
Let's See Your Pass.

378
00:16:36,565 --> 00:16:38,567
I Don't Have One.

379
00:16:38,567 --> 00:16:40,069
Morning Detention
Tomorrow.

380
00:16:40,069 --> 00:16:42,938
Wait Just A Second.
Here Is His Pass.

381
00:16:42,938 --> 00:16:45,141
He Must've Dropped It
Back There.

382
00:16:46,141 --> 00:16:47,409
Come On.

383
00:16:47,409 --> 00:16:50,612
Thanks, Ronny.
Why Did You Do That?

384
00:16:50,612 --> 00:16:52,247
Please, Dorko.
Now Listen,

385
00:16:52,247 --> 00:16:55,217
I Don't Need You Ruining
Detention For Me And My Friends.

386
00:16:55,217 --> 00:16:57,486
Ok? We Have
A Sweet Deal Going,

387
00:16:57,486 --> 00:17:00,155
And You'll Come In
And You'll Be All...

388
00:17:00,155 --> 00:17:03,492
Behavey, See,
And We Don't Need That.

389
00:17:03,492 --> 00:17:05,994
It's Worth The 2 Bucks I Could've Gotten For The Pass.

390
00:17:05,994 --> 00:17:08,508
Now Take A Hike.

391
00:17:19,508 --> 00:17:21,313
Good.

392
00:17:24,313 --> 00:17:26,415
Hey, Martian.

393
00:17:26,415 --> 00:17:29,620
Watch It, Road Hog!

394
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:35,934
Ha Ha Ha!
Nice Wheels, Buddy!

395
00:17:51,874 --> 00:17:54,676
Mrs. Martin, Recording: Hi,
You've Reached The Martin Residence.

396
00:17:54,676 --> 00:17:56,044
Please Leave A Message
After The Tone,

397
00:17:56,044 --> 00:17:58,280
And We'll Get Back To You
As Soon As We Can.

398
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,615
Thank You.

399
00:18:01,517 --> 00:18:02,851
Hey, Little
Brother, It's Me.

400
00:18:02,851 --> 00:18:04,853
If You're Home,
Pick Up The Phone, Please.

401
00:18:04,853 --> 00:18:08,157
Come On, Pick It Up,
Pick Up.

402
00:18:08,157 --> 00:18:10,826
Jay, I Know You're Sitting There Listening To This.

403
00:18:10,826 --> 00:18:13,395
All Right, Look, Uh,
I'm Not Gonna Be Able

404
00:18:13,395 --> 00:18:15,197
To Get Home
Tonight, Ok?

405
00:18:15,197 --> 00:18:17,199
My Jeep Broke Down,
And The Guy Won't Be Able

406
00:18:17,199 --> 00:18:18,867
To Get The Part
Until Tomorrow.

407
00:18:18,867 --> 00:18:22,304
So, I Want You To Call Up The Zachareys

408
00:18:22,304 --> 00:18:23,372
And Ask Them
If You Can Stay

409
00:18:23,372 --> 00:18:24,007
At Their Place
Tonight, Ok?

410
00:18:25,007 --> 00:18:27,342
Uh, My New Eta
Will Be

411
00:18:27,342 --> 00:18:30,045
1600 Hours Tomorrow.

412
00:18:30,045 --> 00:18:31,513
And, Jay,

413
00:18:31,513 --> 00:18:33,048
No Screw-Ups!

414
00:18:34,716 --> 00:18:36,685
If You Told
Mr. Van Dusen,

415
00:18:36,685 --> 00:18:38,520
Then He'll Have To
Investigate It.

416
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,155
There's An Honor Code At Columbus.

417
00:18:40,155 --> 00:18:41,723
"Steadfast In All
That Is True."

418
00:18:41,723 --> 00:18:43,592
I Told You,
Van Dusen Already Knows,

419
00:18:43,592 --> 00:18:45,694
And He's Not Gonna Do
Anything About It,

420
00:18:45,694 --> 00:18:48,063
And I'm Gonna Wind Up
At Starkwell Next Year.

421
00:18:48,063 --> 00:18:50,934
They're Gonna Shave My Head
And Make Me Wear Boots.

422
00:18:51,934 --> 00:18:53,735
Do You Want
To Pet Clancy?

423
00:18:53,735 --> 00:18:55,704
I've Heard That Petting A Dog Can Relieve Stress.

424
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,041
I Don't Think So.
Dogs Hate Me.

425
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:01,109
Clancy Likes You.

426
00:19:01,109 --> 00:19:03,109
He Told You
That, Did He?

427
00:19:01,109 --> 00:19:03,045
In A Way.

428
00:19:03,045 --> 00:19:05,013
Dogs Have A Whole Lot Of Ways Of Communicating.

429
00:19:06,013 --> 00:19:08,018
Fine, Fine, Fine.
Have Clancy Send Me An E-Mail.

430
00:19:10,018 --> 00:19:12,354
Look, Look, I'm Sorry.

431
00:19:12,354 --> 00:19:15,257
It's Just I'm So Upset.

432
00:19:15,257 --> 00:19:16,525
My Life Is So Unfair.

433
00:19:16,525 --> 00:19:18,059
So Do Something.

434
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:19,728
Don't Just Sit Around And Mope About It.

435
00:19:19,728 --> 00:19:21,363
There Has To Be
A Way You Can Prove

436
00:19:21,363 --> 00:19:23,232
That Ronny Stole
Your Presentation,

437
00:19:23,232 --> 00:19:25,032
And If You Have
Some Proof,

438
00:19:25,032 --> 00:19:27,204
Then You Can Go To The Teachers Who Were Judges.

439
00:19:29,204 --> 00:19:31,078
Ha Ha!

440
00:19:36,078 --> 00:19:38,113
I Just Thought Of A Plan.

441
00:19:38,113 --> 00:19:39,383
I Gotta Go.

442
00:19:41,383 --> 00:19:44,051
Ew! Whoa, Whoa, Hey!

443
00:19:44,051 --> 00:19:46,088
Jay, Are You
All Right?

444
00:19:46,088 --> 00:19:48,840
Yeah.

445
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,074
Come On, We're Late!

446
00:20:06,074 --> 00:20:08,076
They're Not Gonna
Start Without Us.

447
00:20:08,076 --> 00:20:10,412
You're The Headmaster
And Ronny...

448
00:20:10,412 --> 00:20:12,347
Ronny Is The Peterson
Scholarship Winner,

449
00:20:12,347 --> 00:20:14,017
And I Couldn't
Be Prouder.

450
00:20:15,017 --> 00:20:17,185
Hello!
Hug The Kid In The Car If You Have To Hug Him.

451
00:20:17,185 --> 00:20:19,373
I'd Like To Get There
Sometime Tonight.

452
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,867
N-N-Nice, Doggie.

453
00:21:38,867 --> 00:21:41,603
Shh! Shh!

454
00:21:41,603 --> 00:21:45,540
Nice Doggie!

455
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:48,613
No, No, No! Shh!

456
00:21:51,613 --> 00:21:52,881
Want A--

457
00:21:52,881 --> 00:21:55,186
How About A Nice
Gummy Candy?

458
00:21:58,186 --> 00:21:59,888
Come On, Ronny,

459
00:21:59,888 --> 00:22:02,125
I Know You Got My Presentation Here Somewhere.

460
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:05,795
Camille!

461
00:22:10,532 --> 00:22:12,102
Come On!

462
00:22:14,102 --> 00:22:17,038
Camille!

463
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:18,240
Camille!

464
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,375
Camille!

465
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:22,544
Camille?

466
00:22:22,544 --> 00:22:24,717
Camille!

467
00:22:28,717 --> 00:22:31,755
Is Someone There?

468
00:22:33,755 --> 00:22:36,626
Ohh! Aah!

469
00:22:37,626 --> 00:22:39,329
Aah!

470
00:22:41,329 --> 00:22:44,342
Aah!

471
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:04,119
No, No, No!
Bad Dog! Go Home!

472
00:23:05,687 --> 00:23:06,021
Go!

473
00:23:12,027 --> 00:23:15,031
Go! Shoo! Go!

474
00:23:17,031 --> 00:23:19,803
Go! Shoo!

475
00:23:21,803 --> 00:23:23,538
No, Camille, Go Home!

476
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:30,494
Get, Get, Get!

477
00:23:45,494 --> 00:23:48,172
Go Home! Get! Go Away!

478
00:23:57,172 --> 00:23:58,177
Come On, Man,
Leave Me Alone!

479
00:24:02,177 --> 00:24:03,684
Ugh!

480
00:24:09,684 --> 00:24:12,826
Good! Now Go Home!

481
00:24:34,676 --> 00:24:37,946
Camille, Come On!

482
00:24:37,946 --> 00:24:40,515
Keep That Stupid Dog
On A Leash!

483
00:24:45,921 --> 00:24:47,924
Ok?

484
00:24:48,924 --> 00:24:51,059
Ugh! Come On! Gross!

485
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:52,464
I'm Gonna Barf!

486
00:24:56,464 --> 00:24:59,868
You're Welcome.

487
00:24:59,868 --> 00:25:00,869
Man, This Is Just Great.

488
00:25:00,869 --> 00:25:03,070
For A Dog They Spend
So Much Money On,

489
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,940
They Sure Don't Watch Out For Her Very Well.

490
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:07,709
All Right, Come On
To My Place.

491
00:25:07,709 --> 00:25:09,945
We'll Call Your Owners
When We Get There.

492
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,588
We're Gonna
Have To Wait

493
00:25:19,588 --> 00:25:20,922
Until After The Van Dusens Get Home

494
00:25:20,922 --> 00:25:23,058
From The Ceremony
To Call Them.

495
00:25:23,058 --> 00:25:28,063
So, Um, Just Behave
And...

496
00:25:28,063 --> 00:25:30,933
Don't Bother Me.

497
00:25:33,268 --> 00:25:35,507
Get Down.

498
00:25:39,507 --> 00:25:42,678
Stay... Stay Down.

499
00:25:43,678 --> 00:25:46,857
Would You Get Down? Dang.

500
00:26:01,463 --> 00:26:02,998
We Put Enough Lead
In That Thing To Sink It.

501
00:26:02,998 --> 00:26:04,998
No Wonder It Stopped.

502
00:26:02,998 --> 00:26:04,334
It Sure Did.

503
00:26:06,334 --> 00:26:07,869
Do You Soldiers
Hear That?

504
00:26:07,869 --> 00:26:10,538
I'm Talking To You,
Boy!

505
00:26:10,538 --> 00:26:13,508
Why Don't You
Get Down Right Now,

506
00:26:13,508 --> 00:26:15,877
And Give Me 50!

507
00:26:15,877 --> 00:26:17,445
That's What I Said--

508
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:30,462
1... 2...3...

509
00:26:37,999 --> 00:26:39,868
What? What Do You Want?

510
00:26:41,369 --> 00:26:44,506
I Don't Know
What That Means.

511
00:26:46,675 --> 00:26:47,676
Are You Hungry?

512
00:26:47,676 --> 00:26:49,978
Fine. Fine.

513
00:26:49,978 --> 00:26:51,246
Let's See What's
In The Fridge.

514
00:26:57,986 --> 00:27:01,856
What Do Dogs Eat? Hmm...

515
00:27:01,856 --> 00:27:05,996
Here We Go.
You Like Pasta?

516
00:27:07,996 --> 00:27:09,041
There You Go.

517
00:27:21,041 --> 00:27:24,905
Here, You Want Some Meatloaf?

518
00:27:55,042 --> 00:27:56,478
Uh-Oh.

519
00:27:56,478 --> 00:27:58,546
Hey, Are You Ok?

520
00:28:02,884 --> 00:28:04,619
Hey, Man, Maybe You
Should've Stopped Eating

521
00:28:04,619 --> 00:28:06,554
After That Tofu Egg Salad.

522
00:28:10,158 --> 00:28:12,427
Did You Kidnap
The Van Dusen's Dog?

523
00:28:12,427 --> 00:28:14,061
Is That Your Plan?

524
00:28:14,061 --> 00:28:15,497
I Didn't Kidnap It.

525
00:28:15,497 --> 00:28:17,499
It Just Followed
Me Home When I Was

526
00:28:17,499 --> 00:28:19,968
At Their House Looking For Evidence.

527
00:28:19,968 --> 00:28:21,269
Hey, I'm Gonna Call
The Van Dusens

528
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:23,338
To Come Get It After
The Awards Ceremony.

529
00:28:23,338 --> 00:28:25,173
Well, How Are You Going To
Explain Being At Their Place?

530
00:28:25,173 --> 00:28:26,775
Did Anybody See You?

531
00:28:26,775 --> 00:28:28,610
Well, Their Maid Saw Me.

532
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:31,279
But I Put On A Mask Before She Could Know Who I Was.

533
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,348
Jay, You're In Trouble.

534
00:28:33,348 --> 00:28:35,116
The Maid Saw Somebody
Sneaking Around,

535
00:28:35,116 --> 00:28:36,851
And Their Prize Show Dog
Is Missing.

536
00:28:36,851 --> 00:28:38,153
You're Gonna Call,

537
00:28:38,153 --> 00:28:39,854
And Van Dusen Is Gonna Know
You Were There.

538
00:28:39,854 --> 00:28:40,855
You Think?

539
00:28:40,855 --> 00:28:42,290
Listen...

540
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:45,460
Just Bring The Dog Back To Van
Dusen's House And Leave Her.

541
00:28:50,298 --> 00:28:54,169
Go In There. Go.
Go In There. Stay.

542
00:28:54,169 --> 00:28:55,170
No!

543
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:59,307
This Is Where
You Live.

544
00:29:00,475 --> 00:29:03,678
Now, Stay In There.
Go, Ok, Go.

545
00:29:03,678 --> 00:29:06,355
Stay In There!

546
00:29:14,355 --> 00:29:16,326
Oh, Oh, Man! Go Home!

547
00:29:18,326 --> 00:29:21,336
Come On.

548
00:29:28,336 --> 00:29:31,840
You Are Not
Coming Home With Me.

549
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,917
Ok?

550
00:29:43,918 --> 00:29:46,421
Stop Following Me, Man.
Go Home!

551
00:29:47,422 --> 00:29:49,118
No, No! You Are Not
Coming Home With Me.

552
00:30:17,118 --> 00:30:20,293
Man, Peterson Is Tight.

553
00:30:25,293 --> 00:30:30,381
Forget It.
You're Going To Starkwell.

554
00:30:46,381 --> 00:30:49,083
Camille! C'mere, Camille!

555
00:30:49,083 --> 00:30:50,251
Dad?

556
00:30:50,251 --> 00:30:52,153
Put It Anywhere
You Want.

557
00:30:52,153 --> 00:30:53,155
Ok.

558
00:30:54,155 --> 00:30:56,724
Ronny, Come On!

559
00:30:56,724 --> 00:30:58,660
Not On The Floor!

560
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,895
Camille?
Camille.

561
00:31:00,895 --> 00:31:02,101
C'mere, Camille.

562
00:31:07,101 --> 00:31:11,406
Welcome To Espn's Highlights
Of Today's Masters Action.

563
00:31:11,406 --> 00:31:12,407
Reporting
From The Clubhouse...

564
00:31:12,407 --> 00:31:15,176
Ward, I Can't
Find Camille.

565
00:31:15,176 --> 00:31:16,844
She Must Be
Around Here Somewhere.

566
00:31:16,844 --> 00:31:18,112
I've Looked
Everywhere.

567
00:31:18,112 --> 00:31:20,848
Everywhere, Eliza?
That Seems Improbable.

568
00:31:20,848 --> 00:31:23,117
Come Help Me
Look!

569
00:31:34,696 --> 00:31:36,030
Ah! Ah! Ah!

570
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:38,533
Get Out Of Here!

571
00:31:38,533 --> 00:31:40,501
Adele, It's Me!
What Are You Doing?!

572
00:31:40,501 --> 00:31:42,003
Adele, What In The World
Do You Think You're Doing?!

573
00:31:43,003 --> 00:31:45,106
You Nearly Spatula-Ed Me
To Death!

574
00:31:45,106 --> 00:31:47,976
Oh! Mr. Van Dusen!

575
00:31:47,976 --> 00:31:49,310
Yeah!

576
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:51,813
I Am So Sorry.

577
00:31:51,813 --> 00:31:52,847
I Tried
To Stop Them,

578
00:31:52,847 --> 00:31:55,116
But There Were
Too Many Of Them.

579
00:31:55,116 --> 00:31:56,484
Too Many Of Who?

580
00:31:56,484 --> 00:31:57,952
They Were
In The Pool House.

581
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:59,554
I--

582
00:31:59,554 --> 00:32:01,729
The Pool House.

583
00:32:07,729 --> 00:32:08,896
Ronny?!

584
00:32:08,896 --> 00:32:10,164
Yeah, Dad?

585
00:32:10,164 --> 00:32:12,533
Is Everything All Right
In The Pool House?

586
00:32:12,533 --> 00:32:14,748
Yeah, It's Fine.
Just Stay Out.

587
00:32:26,748 --> 00:32:28,850
And Now For That
Incredible Hole In One...

588
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:30,385
Ward, I'm Worried.

589
00:32:30,385 --> 00:32:32,253
Adele Said The Yard
Was Swarming

590
00:32:32,253 --> 00:32:33,921
With Huge Masked
Men.

591
00:32:33,921 --> 00:32:35,323
Seems Fine Now.

592
00:32:35,323 --> 00:32:36,891
Ronny Said
The Pool House Is Ok.

593
00:32:36,891 --> 00:32:38,226
Probably Just
Some Neighborhood Kids.

594
00:32:38,226 --> 00:32:39,861
Did You Notice
Anything Missing?

595
00:32:39,861 --> 00:32:41,529
Yes, Camille!

596
00:32:41,529 --> 00:32:43,765
What If They Took Her?

597
00:32:43,765 --> 00:32:44,766
She's A Valuable
Show Dog.

598
00:32:44,766 --> 00:32:46,401
They Must Know
How Much She's Worth.

599
00:32:46,401 --> 00:32:48,269
She's Fine.

600
00:32:48,269 --> 00:32:50,271
The Regional Dog Show Trials Are Only A Week Away.

601
00:32:50,271 --> 00:32:52,373
She Has To Be Ready
To Compete.

602
00:32:52,373 --> 00:32:53,775
She's Probably
Just Scared And Hiding.

603
00:32:53,775 --> 00:32:56,210
She'll Turn Up.
She Always Turns Up.

604
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:58,613
But Ward! You Know
How Camille Gets

605
00:32:58,613 --> 00:33:00,615
Without
Her Medications.

606
00:33:00,615 --> 00:33:05,588
Without Her Medications...

607
00:33:12,226 --> 00:33:15,963
Nice Doggie.
Calm Down, It's Ok.

608
00:33:17,098 --> 00:33:21,436
It's Ok... It's Ok...

609
00:33:21,436 --> 00:33:24,872
Oh, No! Aah!

610
00:33:31,646 --> 00:33:35,993
Oh No! Aah! Aah!

611
00:33:45,993 --> 00:33:47,065
Aah!

612
00:33:51,065 --> 00:33:52,643
Aah!

613
00:35:33,534 --> 00:35:37,413
How Can Such A Little Dog
Cause So Much Damage?

614
00:35:45,413 --> 00:35:48,849
Dad's Glove.

615
00:35:59,961 --> 00:36:00,962
Oh!

616
00:37:15,169 --> 00:37:17,038
Man, Mike Is Gonna
Flip Out.

617
00:37:17,038 --> 00:37:18,873
What Are You
Gonna Do?

618
00:37:18,873 --> 00:37:21,208
I Gotta Get Rid
Of That Dog, First.

619
00:37:21,208 --> 00:37:23,043
I Just Don't Know How To Get
It Back To The Van Dusens

620
00:37:23,043 --> 00:37:25,045
Without Them Thinking
I Stole It.

621
00:37:25,045 --> 00:37:27,381
I Tried Leaving The Stupid Dog There Again Last Night,

622
00:37:27,381 --> 00:37:30,451
But She Wouldn't Stay.

623
00:37:30,451 --> 00:37:32,020
What If You
Called Them Up

624
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,455
And Disguised Your Voice

625
00:37:34,455 --> 00:37:36,190
So They Didn't Know
It Was You

626
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:38,859
And Told Them You Were
Leaving The Dog

627
00:37:38,859 --> 00:37:40,695
In A Basket In The Park,

628
00:37:40,695 --> 00:37:43,865
And They Could Just
Come And Pick It Up?

629
00:37:44,865 --> 00:37:47,312
Hey. Hey, That's Not
Such A Bad Idea.

630
00:37:58,312 --> 00:38:00,653
Testing. 1... 2...3.

631
00:38:14,495 --> 00:38:16,931
Hello?

632
00:38:16,931 --> 00:38:19,533
Good Morning, Mr. Van Dusen.

633
00:38:19,533 --> 00:38:21,068
Who Is This?

634
00:38:21,068 --> 00:38:23,938
I Have Your Dog.

635
00:38:23,938 --> 00:38:25,039
Really?

636
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:26,874
You've Kidnapped Our Dog.

637
00:38:26,874 --> 00:38:29,744
No... No.
No, I Didn't Kidnap--

638
00:38:29,744 --> 00:38:31,912
You Didn't Kidnap
The Dog?

639
00:38:31,912 --> 00:38:33,948
That's Funny. I Thought
That's What It Was Called

640
00:38:33,948 --> 00:38:35,883
When Someone Breaks
Into A House,

641
00:38:35,883 --> 00:38:37,752
Steals A Person's Dog,

642
00:38:37,752 --> 00:38:39,954
Then Calls Up
With A Disguised Voice

643
00:38:39,954 --> 00:38:41,722
Asking For Ransom.

644
00:38:41,722 --> 00:38:43,023
Mr. Van Dusen,
You Don't Understand--

645
00:38:44,023 --> 00:38:45,393
No, You Don't Understand.

646
00:38:45,393 --> 00:38:47,628
I'm Glad You Took The Dog.
You Can Keep Her.

647
00:38:47,628 --> 00:38:49,096
Don't Even Try
To Bring Her Back.

648
00:38:49,096 --> 00:38:51,298
And If I Find You Anywhere
Near My House With That Dog

649
00:38:51,298 --> 00:38:52,700
I'll Have You Arrested
So Fast

650
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,201
It'll Make Your Head Spin.

651
00:38:54,201 --> 00:38:55,870
Oh, And By The Way,

652
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:57,371
How's Camille Doing
Without Her Medication?

653
00:38:57,371 --> 00:38:59,607
Ha Ha Ha!

654
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,486
Oh...

655
00:39:12,486 --> 00:39:15,490
Oh! Oh! Oh!

656
00:39:53,961 --> 00:39:55,763
Aah!

657
00:39:55,763 --> 00:39:58,367
Get Off Me,
You Stupid Dog!

658
00:40:00,367 --> 00:40:02,203
Uhh! Get Off!

659
00:40:02,203 --> 00:40:04,104
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa!

660
00:40:04,104 --> 00:40:05,717
Aah!

661
00:40:42,243 --> 00:40:43,711
Bye-Bye, Camille.

662
00:40:43,711 --> 00:40:47,248
Sadly, I Won't Be Needing
These Allergy Pills Anymore.

663
00:40:47,248 --> 00:40:49,016
I'll Never Sneeze Again
Without That Mutt.

664
00:40:50,016 --> 00:40:51,388
Hah!

665
00:40:54,388 --> 00:40:56,491
Ahh!

666
00:40:57,491 --> 00:40:59,994
Ha Ha Ha! Ha!

667
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:40,200
No, No! Go Away!
Leave Me Alone!

668
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,408
Aah!

669
00:41:47,408 --> 00:41:49,209
Heh Heh! Ha Ha Ha!

670
00:41:49,209 --> 00:41:51,145
Gotcha!

671
00:41:53,747 --> 00:41:55,549
You Might As Well Stop

672
00:41:55,549 --> 00:41:56,550
Because I'm Not
Letting You Out

673
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:58,752
Until I Figure Out
What To Do With You.

674
00:42:03,557 --> 00:42:05,000
You Don't Ever
Give Up, Do You?

675
00:42:18,005 --> 00:42:20,240
Aah! Oohh!

676
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,281
Aah! Aaahhh!

677
00:42:27,281 --> 00:42:30,117
Get Off Of Me!

678
00:42:30,117 --> 00:42:32,498
Aah! Get Off Of Me!

679
00:42:44,498 --> 00:42:47,221
Heh Heh! Ha Ha!

680
00:43:07,221 --> 00:43:09,826
Let Go Of Me,
You Stupid Dog!

681
00:43:12,826 --> 00:43:14,700
Whoa!

682
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:21,402
Ha!

683
00:43:21,402 --> 00:43:24,854
Ha Ha Ha Ha!

684
00:43:40,854 --> 00:43:43,190
What Are You Doing
Home Already?

685
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:46,527
You Said You'd Be Home At 1600 Hours.

686
00:43:46,527 --> 00:43:48,696
You're, Like,
500 Hours Early.

687
00:43:48,696 --> 00:43:50,431
The Garage Got The Part
For The Jeep Early.

688
00:43:50,431 --> 00:43:52,269
Is That Ok With You?

689
00:43:55,269 --> 00:43:57,271
Hey, What Is Up
With That?

690
00:43:57,271 --> 00:43:59,273
Oh, I--I Had
A Little Accident

691
00:43:59,273 --> 00:44:01,041
Climbing A Tree.

692
00:44:01,041 --> 00:44:02,943
Yeah, Whatever.

693
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:05,412
Hey, Those Are My Socks!

694
00:44:05,412 --> 00:44:06,714
Man, Do We Have To
Start This Again.

695
00:44:06,714 --> 00:44:08,849
I Do Own Socks.
I Don't Steal Yours.

696
00:44:08,849 --> 00:44:10,451
Yeah, Whatever.
We'll Just Have A Little Look

697
00:44:10,451 --> 00:44:12,453
In Your Dresser,
Shall We?

698
00:44:12,453 --> 00:44:14,555
Here. Carry This.

699
00:44:14,555 --> 00:44:16,223
Oof!

700
00:44:16,223 --> 00:44:17,891
You're Gonna Have To Toughen Up,
Little Brother,

701
00:44:17,891 --> 00:44:20,194
If You're Gonna Cut It
At Starkwell Next Year.

702
00:44:20,194 --> 00:44:22,930
Come On, Keep Up.
Let's Go, Double Time.

703
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:25,933
Now, I Heard About The Peterson Scholarship.

704
00:44:25,933 --> 00:44:28,135
How?

705
00:44:28,135 --> 00:44:29,737
Rule Number One,
Little Brother,

706
00:44:29,737 --> 00:44:31,705
Always Have
Informants, Ok?

707
00:44:31,705 --> 00:44:34,074
Now, I Know You Worked Hard On That Scholarship,

708
00:44:34,074 --> 00:44:36,310
But Don't Sweat It.
You're Better Off.

709
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:38,149
Don't Go In There!

710
00:44:42,149 --> 00:44:44,418
Why Not?

711
00:44:44,418 --> 00:44:47,054
Maybe We Could
Go Out To Lunch.

712
00:44:47,054 --> 00:44:50,491
You Know, Maybe
A Nice Monte Cristo?

713
00:44:50,491 --> 00:44:53,092
Maybe A Reuben,
Some Sauerkraut?

714
00:44:53,092 --> 00:44:56,063
I Missed You?

715
00:44:56,063 --> 00:44:58,165
Nice Try.

716
00:44:58,165 --> 00:44:59,678
Excuse Me.

717
00:45:11,678 --> 00:45:13,147
I Can Explain.

718
00:45:13,147 --> 00:45:15,149
Come Here, You.

719
00:45:15,149 --> 00:45:16,150
You Threw A Party,
Didn't You?

720
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:17,151
No.

721
00:45:17,151 --> 00:45:18,786
No, You Don't Understand.
I Was Just--

722
00:45:18,786 --> 00:45:20,420
You Little Meatstain!
When I Get Through With You,

723
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:22,523
There Isn't Gonna Be Enough Of
You Left To Spread On Toast!

724
00:45:22,523 --> 00:45:23,000
Come Here!

725
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,202
Oh, You're Dead,
Meatstain.

726
00:45:35,202 --> 00:45:36,870
Ahh!

727
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:38,272
Mom's Gonna Hear
About This!

728
00:45:38,272 --> 00:45:39,840
Ahh! Ahh!

729
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,342
What Was That?

730
00:45:42,342 --> 00:45:43,710
No--Don't--Noth--

731
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:47,323
No, No, No.
Wait. Ok.

732
00:45:56,323 --> 00:45:58,525
See? There's Nothing
In There, Ok?

733
00:45:58,525 --> 00:45:59,129
Yeah, See?

734
00:46:02,129 --> 00:46:03,130
Ahh!

735
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:06,868
Ooh! Ooh!

736
00:46:07,868 --> 00:46:09,169
What Is This Thing?

737
00:46:09,169 --> 00:46:12,139
Ahh! Ahh!

738
00:46:19,646 --> 00:46:20,014
Ahhh!

739
00:46:22,916 --> 00:46:24,187
He's Right Behind You.
Hurry Up!

740
00:46:27,187 --> 00:46:29,857
All Right, Explain.
Whose Dog Is That?

741
00:46:29,857 --> 00:46:31,692
It's The Van Dusens' Dog.

742
00:46:31,692 --> 00:46:33,092
Headmaster
Van Dusen?

743
00:46:33,092 --> 00:46:35,896
He Wanted Me To Help
Watch It For A While.

744
00:46:35,896 --> 00:46:38,332
And I Asked Mom,
And She Said It Was Ok.

745
00:46:38,332 --> 00:46:40,367
Oh, Yeah, Right.
Prove It.

746
00:46:40,367 --> 00:46:41,602
How Am I Supposed
To Prove It?

747
00:46:41,602 --> 00:46:43,003
Why Else Would I Have
The Van Dusens' Dog?

748
00:46:44,003 --> 00:46:45,105
Yeah. Well,
You Know What?

749
00:46:45,105 --> 00:46:46,440
I'm Not Taking
Responsibility

750
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,074
For That Stupid
Pooch, Ok?

751
00:46:48,074 --> 00:46:49,710
Now You Get Out There And Clean Up That Mess.

752
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:50,011
I'm Not Helping.

753
00:46:51,011 --> 00:46:53,580
Get Out There
And Subdue That Dog!

754
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:55,182
Go!

755
00:46:56,350 --> 00:46:58,418
Ahh! Oh!

756
00:46:58,418 --> 00:47:00,056
Get Out Of There!

757
00:47:08,595 --> 00:47:12,366
Oh, For Crying Out Loud!

758
00:47:12,366 --> 00:47:14,034
Step Aside, Son.

759
00:47:14,034 --> 00:47:15,369
Watch How A Real Man

760
00:47:15,369 --> 00:47:17,204
Handles That
Stupid Mutt.

761
00:47:17,204 --> 00:47:19,909
Hey, Dog!

762
00:47:21,909 --> 00:47:24,611
Aah! Ahh! No!

763
00:47:24,611 --> 00:47:26,647
No, No, No!

764
00:47:28,949 --> 00:47:31,585
I Can't Fight!
I Can't! Wait! Wait...

765
00:47:31,585 --> 00:47:34,087
No! No!

766
00:47:34,087 --> 00:47:36,056
Mike, Give Me
Your Hand!

767
00:47:36,056 --> 00:47:37,056
Aah!

768
00:47:36,056 --> 00:47:37,162
Mike!

769
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,302
Jay, Do Something, Man!

770
00:47:48,302 --> 00:47:49,303
Get Me Off Of This Table.

771
00:47:49,303 --> 00:47:50,671
Look, It's Starting
To Crack, Man!

772
00:47:50,671 --> 00:47:52,239
You Gotta Help Me!
Do Something!

773
00:47:52,239 --> 00:47:53,240
Distract It Or Something!

774
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:54,675
Come Over Here.

775
00:47:54,675 --> 00:47:55,676
No, No, No!

776
00:47:55,676 --> 00:47:58,779
Get Out Of Here!
Shoo! Shoo!

777
00:47:58,779 --> 00:48:00,614
The Table Is Cracking!

778
00:48:00,614 --> 00:48:02,918
Just Come Over Here!

779
00:48:04,918 --> 00:48:05,919
Ow!

780
00:48:05,919 --> 00:48:07,257
You Ok?

781
00:48:10,257 --> 00:48:11,695
No!

782
00:48:14,695 --> 00:48:16,168
Stay Close To Me.
I Got You.

783
00:48:21,168 --> 00:48:23,270
Ha Ha Ha.
Yeah.

784
00:48:26,005 --> 00:48:28,108
What's Happening?

785
00:48:28,108 --> 00:48:29,109
Cheap Batteries.

786
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:31,612
Fetch!

787
00:48:32,612 --> 00:48:34,681
Into The Kitchen!

788
00:48:34,681 --> 00:48:36,357
Hurry Up!

789
00:48:43,357 --> 00:48:46,360
Ahh!

790
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:47,828
Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!

791
00:48:47,828 --> 00:48:49,629
Ahh!

792
00:48:49,629 --> 00:48:51,636
Go Away!

793
00:48:56,636 --> 00:48:58,810
Go Check It Out.

794
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:05,479
Is She All Right?

795
00:49:05,479 --> 00:49:08,181
She's Still Breathing.

796
00:49:08,181 --> 00:49:09,683
I Think She Just
Knocked Herself Out.

797
00:49:09,683 --> 00:49:11,687
She Should Be Ok.

798
00:49:13,687 --> 00:49:15,722
Man, You Really Saved
My Skin Back There.

799
00:49:15,722 --> 00:49:16,723
Ha.

800
00:49:16,723 --> 00:49:17,259
Don't Mention It.

801
00:49:19,259 --> 00:49:20,861
You Think Well
On Your Feet,

802
00:49:20,861 --> 00:49:23,697
And You Keep A Cool
Head Under Pressure.

803
00:49:23,697 --> 00:49:26,271
Those Are Good Qualities In A Soldier.

804
00:49:37,244 --> 00:49:38,879
Go Away!

805
00:49:39,913 --> 00:49:41,050
I Said--

806
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:44,351
Phooh.

807
00:49:44,351 --> 00:49:45,786
Hello, Ward.

808
00:49:45,786 --> 00:49:47,621
Mr. Columbus, Sir.

809
00:49:47,621 --> 00:49:50,424
Ward, We've Been
All Through This.

810
00:49:50,424 --> 00:49:53,193
Mr. Columbus
Was My Father.

811
00:49:53,193 --> 00:49:54,027
Besides,
We're Family.

812
00:49:55,027 --> 00:49:56,797
You Can
Just Call Me Sir.

813
00:49:56,797 --> 00:50:00,032
Yes, Sir. I Guess You've
Heard About Our Tragedy.

814
00:50:00,032 --> 00:50:01,535
Poor Camille.

815
00:50:01,535 --> 00:50:03,208
That's Why I'm Here.

816
00:50:08,208 --> 00:50:10,544
Eliza Called Me,
Distraught.

817
00:50:10,544 --> 00:50:12,612
She Loves That Dog.

818
00:50:12,612 --> 00:50:14,581
As Do We All, Sir.

819
00:50:14,581 --> 00:50:17,217
I'll Cut Right
To The Chase, Ward.

820
00:50:17,217 --> 00:50:19,653
Find That Dog.

821
00:50:19,653 --> 00:50:21,488
Whatever It Takes.

822
00:50:21,488 --> 00:50:23,824
Eliza Wants To Win
That Dog Show.

823
00:50:23,824 --> 00:50:26,626
Make My Daughter
Happy

824
00:50:26,626 --> 00:50:30,347
Or I'll Find A Competent Headmaster For My School.

825
00:50:47,347 --> 00:50:49,783
Where's The Money
Mom Left?

826
00:50:49,783 --> 00:50:51,751
In The Cookie Jar.

827
00:50:51,751 --> 00:50:53,653
And When You Get
Finished Over Here,

828
00:50:53,653 --> 00:50:55,188
Get Started
On The Living Room.

829
00:50:55,188 --> 00:50:56,857
And I Suggest
You Shake A Leg.

830
00:50:56,857 --> 00:50:59,426
We've Got Some Calisthenics
To Get To, Soldier.

831
00:50:59,426 --> 00:51:01,128
What? No Way!

832
00:51:01,128 --> 00:51:03,196
Hey, Don't Give Me
Any Lip. All Right?

833
00:51:03,196 --> 00:51:04,030
This Is For
Your Own Good.

834
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:06,133
Now You May Be Smart,

835
00:51:06,133 --> 00:51:07,534
But You're Still
A Little Scrawny.

836
00:51:07,534 --> 00:51:10,036
You Won't Last A Week
At Starkwell.

837
00:51:10,036 --> 00:51:11,538
Now What's
Van Dusen's Number?

838
00:51:11,538 --> 00:51:13,974
I'm Gonna Call Him And Tell
Him To Pick Up His Insane Dog.

839
00:51:13,974 --> 00:51:14,975
No, No, No!

840
00:51:14,975 --> 00:51:17,277
I Mean, I'll Do It.

841
00:51:17,277 --> 00:51:18,879
You Know...

842
00:51:18,879 --> 00:51:21,715
This Is All
My Fault Anyway, So...

843
00:51:21,715 --> 00:51:24,951
I Should Be
Responsible For It.

844
00:51:24,951 --> 00:51:26,286
That's What I Like
To Hear.

845
00:51:26,286 --> 00:51:27,021
Good, Good,
Little Brother.

846
00:51:28,021 --> 00:51:29,956
You're Taking Responsibility For Yourself.

847
00:51:29,956 --> 00:51:31,958
Now, I'm Gonna Be
Upstairs Napping,

848
00:51:31,958 --> 00:51:33,827
And When Mom Calls,

849
00:51:33,827 --> 00:51:36,352
I Want To Talk
To Her.

850
00:51:59,352 --> 00:52:00,887
Please Ring.

851
00:52:00,887 --> 00:52:03,156
I'll Be A Nicer Person,
I Promise.

852
00:52:03,156 --> 00:52:04,157
I Won't Ever--

853
00:52:06,025 --> 00:52:07,761
Hello? Hello?

854
00:52:07,761 --> 00:52:09,529
Hello, Mr. Van Dusen.

855
00:52:09,529 --> 00:52:10,830
Ah, It's You.

856
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:13,700
Yeah. Um, I'm Gonna
Leave Your Dog In The Park.

857
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:15,335
Well, What Do You Want?
$2,000?

858
00:52:15,335 --> 00:52:17,270
'Cause That's All
She's Worth, Really.

859
00:52:17,270 --> 00:52:18,905
No, No. That's Not What--

860
00:52:18,905 --> 00:52:20,407
Not What You Had
In Mind? Ok, Ok.

861
00:52:20,407 --> 00:52:21,408
5,000.

862
00:52:21,408 --> 00:52:22,709
You Said The Park?

863
00:52:22,709 --> 00:52:23,843
Let's Meet At
The Ice Skating Rink.

864
00:52:23,843 --> 00:52:25,712
4:00. Ok?

865
00:52:25,712 --> 00:52:27,393
Ah.

866
00:52:40,393 --> 00:52:42,429
Do I Even Want To Know

867
00:52:42,429 --> 00:52:44,898
What You Were Up To
In There?

868
00:52:44,898 --> 00:52:46,800
I Thought You Were
Taking A Nap.

869
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:49,102
I Changed My Mind.

870
00:52:49,102 --> 00:52:51,304
Well, I Didn't Want
To Disturb You,

871
00:52:51,304 --> 00:52:52,806
So I Called Up
Mr. Van Dusen

872
00:52:52,806 --> 00:52:54,975
And Asked Him If I Can Bring The Dog Back Now.

873
00:52:54,975 --> 00:52:56,476
And He Said Meet Him
At The Park,

874
00:52:56,476 --> 00:52:58,912
So Can I Get A Lift?

875
00:52:58,912 --> 00:53:03,085
Well, I Guess I Do Owe You
From Before, So Let's Go.

876
00:53:05,085 --> 00:53:06,720
Did You Ask
Van Dusen For Money?

877
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,589
What? Excuse Me?

878
00:53:09,589 --> 00:53:11,258
For The Damages
To The House.

879
00:53:11,258 --> 00:53:12,659
I Mean,
His Dog Caused It.

880
00:53:12,659 --> 00:53:14,928
I'd Say It's At Least A Couple Hundred Bucks' Worth.

881
00:53:14,928 --> 00:53:16,730
Oh. Uh, Oh...

882
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:17,964
Hey, Ask Him.

883
00:53:17,964 --> 00:53:19,165
Ok? He's Loaded.

884
00:53:19,165 --> 00:53:20,467
He Owes Us.

885
00:53:20,467 --> 00:53:24,972
Ok. All Right, Sure.
I'll Ask.

886
00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:31,611
Hurry, Man. She's Waking Up.

887
00:53:31,611 --> 00:53:32,746
What?

888
00:53:32,746 --> 00:53:34,314
Ahh! Oh, My God!

889
00:53:34,314 --> 00:53:35,849
Ahh!

890
00:53:35,849 --> 00:53:37,849
Pull Over!

891
00:53:35,849 --> 00:53:37,518
I'm Pullin'!

892
00:53:39,519 --> 00:53:41,023
Ahh!

893
00:53:44,023 --> 00:53:45,292
Hey, Man, Jump!

894
00:53:45,292 --> 00:53:46,527
Jump!

895
00:53:47,527 --> 00:53:49,101
Run! Run!

896
00:53:55,101 --> 00:53:56,369
No, No!

897
00:53:56,369 --> 00:53:57,003
She's Getting Away!

898
00:53:58,003 --> 00:53:59,806
Great.
This Is Just Great.

899
00:53:59,806 --> 00:54:01,841
No, See, Now You're
Gonna Have To Tell

900
00:54:01,841 --> 00:54:03,943
Van Dusen That You
Lost His Dog.

901
00:54:03,943 --> 00:54:06,680
But She's A Small Dog.
She Can't Go Too Far.

902
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:08,348
No. You Know What?
I Did Not Sign Up

903
00:54:08,348 --> 00:54:09,016
For A Search
And Rescue, Ok?

904
00:54:10,016 --> 00:54:12,619
This Is Your
Responsibility Now.

905
00:54:12,619 --> 00:54:15,789
I'm Going Home.

906
00:54:15,789 --> 00:54:18,558
And When You Get Home,

907
00:54:18,558 --> 00:54:20,794
If I Just So Happen
To Be Asleep,

908
00:54:20,794 --> 00:54:24,698
Please Don't Wake Me,
All Right?

909
00:54:24,698 --> 00:54:26,336
Good Luck.

910
00:54:29,336 --> 00:54:31,697
Thanks For Nothing!

911
00:54:57,697 --> 00:54:59,299
Good Afternoon.

912
00:54:59,299 --> 00:55:00,533
Hi.

913
00:55:00,533 --> 00:55:02,335
Do We Have Business
To Take Care Of?

914
00:55:02,335 --> 00:55:03,003
What Kind
Of Business?

915
00:55:04,003 --> 00:55:06,777
Doggie Business.

916
00:55:10,777 --> 00:55:12,179
Hey! Watch It, Mister.

917
00:55:13,179 --> 00:55:14,547
Ahh!

918
00:55:14,547 --> 00:55:17,229
Ugh.

919
00:55:29,229 --> 00:55:31,231
Find The Dog?

920
00:55:31,231 --> 00:55:32,934
Don't Worry About It.

921
00:55:34,934 --> 00:55:36,034
Well, How Much Money

922
00:55:36,034 --> 00:55:38,204
Did Van Dusen
Fork Over?

923
00:55:38,204 --> 00:55:39,739
Um, W-W-Well,

924
00:55:39,739 --> 00:55:40,740
He Didn't
Give Me Any Money

925
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:42,809
'Cause You Know
How He Is.

926
00:55:42,809 --> 00:55:44,944
Said It's Not
His Fault.

927
00:55:44,944 --> 00:55:46,880
Jay, Come On,
Little Brother!

928
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,882
His Dog
Is A Nut Case!

929
00:55:48,882 --> 00:55:50,583
You Don't Ask Someone To Watch Your Dog

930
00:55:50,583 --> 00:55:52,452
And Then Not
Tell Them That.

931
00:55:52,452 --> 00:55:53,453
You Know What?

932
00:55:53,453 --> 00:55:54,454
I'll Get Him To Pay.

933
00:55:54,454 --> 00:55:55,789
No, No, No!
Don't Do That!

934
00:55:55,789 --> 00:55:57,724
Because, Um...

935
00:55:57,724 --> 00:55:58,792
'Cause You Can't.

936
00:55:58,792 --> 00:56:00,493
Actually,
Yes, I Can.

937
00:56:00,493 --> 00:56:01,995
Why?
Because He Owes Us.

938
00:56:01,995 --> 00:56:03,997
Now Hand Over
The Phone!

939
00:56:03,997 --> 00:56:05,465
Hey, Give Me That.

940
00:56:05,465 --> 00:56:07,500
Let Go!
Hey, Come Here!

941
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,070
Come Here.

942
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:12,070
Come Here.

943
00:56:12,070 --> 00:56:13,072
Get Off Me.

944
00:56:13,072 --> 00:56:14,072
Yeah, Come Here.
Give It.

945
00:56:14,072 --> 00:56:15,408
Give It, Give It.
Let Go.

946
00:56:15,408 --> 00:56:16,476
Let Go!

947
00:56:16,476 --> 00:56:18,111
Man, Stop. That's
My Drawing Hand.

948
00:56:18,111 --> 00:56:19,179
Then Let Go!

949
00:56:19,179 --> 00:56:20,681
Give Me It!

950
00:56:21,681 --> 00:56:23,283
Ha, See?

951
00:56:23,283 --> 00:56:25,585
Mike!

952
00:56:25,585 --> 00:56:27,925
There's Something
I've Gotta Tell You.

953
00:56:31,925 --> 00:56:34,260
How Could You Let
This Happen To You?!

954
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:37,330
You Should Have Spoken Up
Right From The Very Beginning,

955
00:56:37,330 --> 00:56:38,965
Right When You
Knew That Ronny

956
00:56:38,965 --> 00:56:40,366
Was Giving
Your Presentation!

957
00:56:40,366 --> 00:56:42,936
You Have Got To Find
A Spine, Little Brother!

958
00:56:42,936 --> 00:56:44,938
You're Gonna Get Crushed
At Starkwell.

959
00:56:44,938 --> 00:56:48,508
Man, Enough With
The Starkwell Stuff Already!

960
00:56:48,508 --> 00:56:50,710
I Don't Want
To Go To Starkwell!

961
00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:52,779
I Don't Want The Same Things
You Want, Mike.

962
00:56:52,779 --> 00:56:54,014
I Want To Study Art.

963
00:56:55,014 --> 00:56:56,783
Art Is For People
Who Think

964
00:56:56,783 --> 00:56:58,485
That They're Better
Than Everyone Else!

965
00:56:58,485 --> 00:56:59,018
And I'll Tell You Something Else,
Little Brother.

966
00:57:00,018 --> 00:57:01,521
If It Wasn't
For The Military,

967
00:57:01,521 --> 00:57:04,190
People Wouldn't Even Be Able
To Waste Their Time With Art,

968
00:57:04,190 --> 00:57:05,528
Because There Wouldn't
Be Any Freedom.

969
00:57:08,528 --> 00:57:11,866
Dad Would've Wanted Me
To Do Whatever I Wanted To Do.

970
00:57:12,866 --> 00:57:15,902
Look, I Can't Get
Involved With This.

971
00:57:15,902 --> 00:57:17,470
A Thing Like This

972
00:57:17,470 --> 00:57:19,506
Could Ruin
My Military Career.

973
00:57:19,506 --> 00:57:20,640
You Figure It Out.

974
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,208
I'm Not Helping.

975
00:57:22,208 --> 00:57:24,544
I Don't Want
Any Part Of This.

976
00:57:24,544 --> 00:57:27,247
Why Would This Time
Be Any Different?

977
00:57:27,247 --> 00:57:29,415
You Never Helped Me
With Anything!

978
00:57:29,415 --> 00:57:31,985
That's Because You've Always Been Such A Little Baby!

979
00:57:31,985 --> 00:57:34,187
Gosh, You're Such
A Snot!

980
00:57:34,187 --> 00:57:35,922
Oh, Here Come
The Tears.

981
00:57:35,922 --> 00:57:38,025
Go Ahead. Cry, Baby.

982
00:57:40,025 --> 00:57:41,594
Man, I Hate You!

983
00:57:41,594 --> 00:57:44,330
This Is What I Get.

984
00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:46,833
This Is What I Get
After Being A Brother

985
00:57:46,833 --> 00:57:49,269
And A Father To You
For The Past 6 Years.

986
00:57:49,269 --> 00:57:51,337
That's Really Nice, Jay.

987
00:57:51,337 --> 00:57:52,839
Man, You Were
Nothing To Me!

988
00:57:52,839 --> 00:57:54,707
You Just Don't
Remember.

989
00:57:54,707 --> 00:57:57,110
You Were Too Young
When It Happened.

990
00:57:57,110 --> 00:57:59,045
Man, I Used To Do
A Ton Of Stuff For You.

991
00:57:59,045 --> 00:58:00,081
Man, I Remember Plenty.

992
00:58:02,081 --> 00:58:04,450
This One Night For Sure...

993
00:58:04,450 --> 00:58:08,054
Right After He Died.

994
00:58:08,054 --> 00:58:10,757
I Was 7 Years Old.

995
00:58:10,757 --> 00:58:13,393
I Had A Nightmare,
And I Crawled Into Your Bed.

996
00:58:13,393 --> 00:58:17,730
I Was Crying,
And You Woke Up And You Pushed Me Out.

997
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:19,933
You Wouldn't Even
Listen To Me.

998
00:58:19,933 --> 00:58:22,969
All You Said To Me
Was Stop Being Such A Baby.

999
00:58:22,969 --> 00:58:26,272
But I Was 7, Mike.

1000
00:58:26,272 --> 00:58:28,141
<I>I Was A Baby.</I>

1001
00:58:28,141 --> 00:58:30,810
I Don't Remember That.

1002
00:58:30,810 --> 00:58:32,114
Well, I'll Never Forget It.

1003
00:58:35,114 --> 00:58:38,322
It's When I Learned
I Should Never Count On You.

1004
00:58:42,322 --> 00:58:47,126
Hey. Just...
Just Wait, Ok?

1005
00:58:47,126 --> 00:58:48,165
Sit Down.

1006
00:58:52,165 --> 00:58:55,001
Forget About
The Stupid Dog, Ok?

1007
00:58:56,001 --> 00:58:58,504
It Followed You Home.
It Got Out On Its Own.

1008
00:58:58,504 --> 00:59:01,776
It Probably Would've
Been Lost Anyway.

1009
00:59:03,776 --> 00:59:06,846
I Don't Know, Mike.

1010
00:59:06,846 --> 00:59:07,981
I Mean...

1011
00:59:07,981 --> 00:59:10,650
It Sort Of Is My Fault
That The Dog Got Out.

1012
00:59:10,650 --> 00:59:12,352
Please.

1013
00:59:12,352 --> 00:59:14,253
I'm Sure That Silly
Dog Couldn't Wait

1014
00:59:14,253 --> 00:59:16,923
To Get Away
From Van Dusen.

1015
00:59:16,923 --> 00:59:17,924
Come On.

1016
00:59:17,924 --> 00:59:19,959
Someone Will
Find It, Adopt It.

1017
00:59:19,959 --> 00:59:21,027
It'll Be Much
Happier.

1018
00:59:22,027 --> 00:59:23,596
I Guess.

1019
00:59:23,596 --> 00:59:25,531
And I'm Gonna Call Van Dusen And Get To The Bottom

1020
00:59:25,531 --> 00:59:27,467
Of This Stolen
Presentation Thing.

1021
00:59:27,467 --> 00:59:29,802
No One Steals
From The Martins.

1022
00:59:29,802 --> 00:59:31,671
If Ronny Won With
Your Presentation,

1023
00:59:31,671 --> 00:59:33,306
Then You Deserve
That Scholarship,

1024
00:59:33,306 --> 00:59:34,674
And I'm Gonna
Get It For You.

1025
00:59:34,674 --> 00:59:37,844
But Van Dusen
Is Just Gonna Deny It.

1026
00:59:37,844 --> 00:59:39,679
We'll See.

1027
00:59:39,679 --> 00:59:40,947
Don't Worry About It.

1028
00:59:40,947 --> 00:59:42,117
You Ok?

1029
00:59:44,117 --> 00:59:45,218
But Mr. Van Dusen,

1030
00:59:45,218 --> 00:59:46,686
The Presentations
Were Exactly The Same.

1031
00:59:46,686 --> 00:59:47,687
Uh-Huh.

1032
00:59:47,687 --> 00:59:49,355
Word For Word.

1033
00:59:49,355 --> 00:59:51,724
I've Been Over All This With Your Brother, Michael.

1034
00:59:51,724 --> 00:59:52,725
Sir--

1035
00:59:52,725 --> 00:59:55,161
Ronny Wrote That
Presentation Himself.

1036
00:59:56,529 --> 00:59:58,231
Are We Clear
On This Now?

1037
00:59:58,231 --> 01:00:00,968
Good Night.

1038
01:00:01,968 --> 01:00:03,469
Well,
What Did He Say?

1039
01:00:03,469 --> 01:00:05,805
Well, He Said Ronny
Wrote The Presentation.

1040
01:00:05,805 --> 01:00:07,407
Told You He
Would Say That.

1041
01:00:07,407 --> 01:00:09,509
Well,
He's Obviously Lying.

1042
01:00:09,509 --> 01:00:10,877
How Can You Tell?

1043
01:00:10,877 --> 01:00:12,712
Well, His Mouth
Was Moving For One,

1044
01:00:12,712 --> 01:00:15,181
And Secondly,
Van Dusen's Pond Scum, Ok?

1045
01:00:15,181 --> 01:00:16,382
He's Always Been Pond Scum.

1046
01:00:16,382 --> 01:00:17,850
That's How I Know
He's Lying.

1047
01:00:17,850 --> 01:00:19,686
Hey, Do You Remember That
Time When I Was At Columbus

1048
01:00:19,686 --> 01:00:21,521
And I Got Cut
From The Baseball Team

1049
01:00:21,521 --> 01:00:22,822
To Make Room For His Nephew

1050
01:00:22,822 --> 01:00:25,224
Who Never Played Baseball
Before In His Life?

1051
01:00:25,224 --> 01:00:27,527
Well, Mike,
There's Nothing We Can Do About It Now.

1052
01:00:27,527 --> 01:00:29,829
Well, We Have
To Do Something.

1053
01:00:29,829 --> 01:00:30,030
I Mean, We Can't
Just Let Van Dusen

1054
01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:33,266
Get Away With This.

1055
01:00:33,266 --> 01:00:34,434
You Know What?

1056
01:00:34,434 --> 01:00:36,034
Here's What
We'll Do.

1057
01:00:36,034 --> 01:00:38,371
We'll Find
This Mutt Of His, Right?

1058
01:00:38,371 --> 01:00:40,506
And Since Van Dusen Seems
So Eager To Pay A Reward

1059
01:00:40,506 --> 01:00:41,507
For His Lost Pooch,

1060
01:00:41,507 --> 01:00:42,508
We'll Just Let Him.

1061
01:00:42,508 --> 01:00:43,010
But In The Meantime,

1062
01:00:44,010 --> 01:00:46,279
We Have To Stall For Time
While We Look For The Dog.

1063
01:00:46,279 --> 01:00:47,346
Wait, Mike.

1064
01:00:47,346 --> 01:00:48,881
Are You Sure This Is
The Right Thing To Do?

1065
01:00:48,881 --> 01:00:51,884
Hey, This Is About
Family Honor, Jay.

1066
01:00:51,884 --> 01:00:54,187
You're Going
To The Peterson Academy.

1067
01:00:54,187 --> 01:00:56,622
You Worked Hard For That Scholarship,
All Right?

1068
01:00:56,622 --> 01:00:57,659
You Deserve It.

1069
01:00:59,659 --> 01:01:02,128
Ok, What Did You Do
With My Brother Mike?

1070
01:01:02,128 --> 01:01:04,230
Ha Ha. Very Funny.

1071
01:01:04,230 --> 01:01:05,398
Hey,
But If We Do This,

1072
01:01:05,398 --> 01:01:07,200
We're Gonna Do It
The Army Way, Ok?

1073
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:08,534
Strict And Covert.

1074
01:01:08,534 --> 01:01:10,603
Not A Word About This
To Anyone. You Understand?

1075
01:01:10,603 --> 01:01:12,603
Right.

1076
01:01:10,603 --> 01:01:12,583
All Right.

1077
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:25,251
It Is Gonna
Be A Great Party.

1078
01:01:25,251 --> 01:01:26,419
It Will.
It's Gonna Be Great.

1079
01:01:26,419 --> 01:01:30,790
But It Would Be Even Better
If You Could Be There.

1080
01:01:30,790 --> 01:01:32,660
Jay!

1081
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:35,661
Hey, Ronny.

1082
01:01:35,661 --> 01:01:36,662
Martian.

1083
01:01:36,662 --> 01:01:38,662
What's Up?

1084
01:01:36,662 --> 01:01:38,931
Nothin'.

1085
01:01:38,931 --> 01:01:40,099
Anyway, Listen.

1086
01:01:40,099 --> 01:01:42,235
If You Guys Need
Hall Passes,

1087
01:01:42,235 --> 01:01:44,170
I Mean,
If You Do Need 'Em,

1088
01:01:44,170 --> 01:01:45,005
I Am Running
A Special This Week.

1089
01:01:46,005 --> 01:01:47,273
2 For One.

1090
01:01:47,273 --> 01:01:50,476
So, You Should Call Me
About The Party Or... Or

1091
01:01:50,476 --> 01:01:52,779
Uh, You Know, You Should
E-Mail Me, Page Me, Fax Me,

1092
01:01:52,779 --> 01:01:54,347
Write Me, Whatever.

1093
01:01:54,347 --> 01:01:56,415
All Right, Babe? Bye.

1094
01:01:58,251 --> 01:01:59,752
I'm Glad You Made It,
Jay.

1095
01:01:59,752 --> 01:02:01,754
Ronny's Been Hanging
Around Me Like A Mosquito.

1096
01:02:01,754 --> 01:02:03,256
Never Stops
Being A Pest.

1097
01:02:03,256 --> 01:02:04,257
Jay Martin,

1098
01:02:04,257 --> 01:02:06,025
Please Report
To Mr. Van Dusen's Office.

1099
01:02:07,025 --> 01:02:12,966
Jay Martin, Report
To Mr. Van Dusen's Office.

1100
01:02:13,966 --> 01:02:15,668
Mr. Martin?

1101
01:02:15,668 --> 01:02:17,470
Yes, Sir?

1102
01:02:17,470 --> 01:02:19,038
My Dog Is Missing.

1103
01:02:19,038 --> 01:02:22,977
I Want To Talk To You About Getting Her Back.

1104
01:02:24,977 --> 01:02:26,679
I Am So Sorry,
Mr. Van Dusen--

1105
01:02:26,679 --> 01:02:27,847
Yeah, Yeah, I Know.

1106
01:02:27,847 --> 01:02:30,683
Looks Like A Textbook Dog-Napping Job.

1107
01:02:30,683 --> 01:02:31,018
Obviously, Somebody
Knows How Much

1108
01:02:32,018 --> 01:02:33,221
A Prize Show Dog
Is Worth.

1109
01:02:35,221 --> 01:02:36,489
I'm Putting Student Council

1110
01:02:36,489 --> 01:02:37,890
In Charge Of Posting
Reward Signs.

1111
01:02:37,890 --> 01:02:40,059
As President,
I Want You To Organize It.

1112
01:02:40,059 --> 01:02:41,894
$5,000 For Information

1113
01:02:41,894 --> 01:02:43,796
Leading To The Return
Of Camille.

1114
01:02:43,796 --> 01:02:47,000
Wow... That's A Lot
Of Money.

1115
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,001
Whoever Tries To Bring
The Little Fluffball Back

1116
01:02:50,001 --> 01:02:51,404
Is Obviously The Dog-Napper.

1117
01:02:51,404 --> 01:02:53,406
When They Show Up
With The Dog,

1118
01:02:53,406 --> 01:02:56,810
I'll Have Him Arrested.
Everybody's Happy.

1119
01:02:57,810 --> 01:02:58,911
I Want Them Up By Tonight!

1120
01:02:58,911 --> 01:03:00,179
300 Signs!

1121
01:03:00,179 --> 01:03:02,047
No Excuses.

1122
01:03:02,047 --> 01:03:03,382
Go, Go, Go!

1123
01:03:03,382 --> 01:03:05,854
Oh. Yes, Sir.

1124
01:03:07,854 --> 01:03:10,757
He Talked About Them
Getting Arrested.

1125
01:03:11,757 --> 01:03:13,726
What Do I Do?

1126
01:03:13,726 --> 01:03:15,394
He Wants To Start
A War? All Right.

1127
01:03:15,394 --> 01:03:17,496
We Can Play That Game
For A Little While.

1128
01:03:17,496 --> 01:03:18,698
What About The Posters?

1129
01:03:18,698 --> 01:03:20,833
Stall As Long
As You Can, All Right?

1130
01:03:20,833 --> 01:03:23,604
Meet Me At Home,
1600 Hours.

1131
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:28,908
Yes, Hello?

1132
01:03:28,908 --> 01:03:30,776
Hello, Van Dusen.

1133
01:03:30,776 --> 01:03:32,043
Where Were You
Last Night?

1134
01:03:32,043 --> 01:03:33,179
I Waited
Over An Hour.

1135
01:03:33,179 --> 01:03:35,181
Where Was I?
Where Were You?

1136
01:03:35,181 --> 01:03:36,016
I Was There.

1137
01:03:37,016 --> 01:03:38,451
At The Fountain?

1138
01:03:38,451 --> 01:03:40,085
The Marble Statue
Of The Angels

1139
01:03:40,085 --> 01:03:41,520
In The Center
Of The Park?

1140
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:43,923
You Said The Ice Skating
Rink Near The Entrance.

1141
01:03:43,923 --> 01:03:45,424
That Is Insane.

1142
01:03:45,424 --> 01:03:47,260
Why Would I Ever
Agree To Meet You

1143
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:48,261
At An Ice Rink?

1144
01:03:48,261 --> 01:03:50,596
Witnesses, Man! Unh!

1145
01:03:50,596 --> 01:03:51,731
Use A Little Common
Sense, Will You?

1146
01:03:51,731 --> 01:03:52,732
Look, I Don't Have To---

1147
01:03:52,732 --> 01:03:53,733
Never Mind.

1148
01:03:53,733 --> 01:03:54,734
I Forgive You.

1149
01:03:54,734 --> 01:03:55,868
What?

1150
01:03:55,868 --> 01:03:57,703
All Right. Now, Here's
What We're Gonna Do, Ok?

1151
01:03:57,703 --> 01:04:00,873
Just So There's
No Confusion Or Mix-Ups.

1152
01:04:00,873 --> 01:04:04,878
I Want You
To Meet Me At, Um...

1153
01:04:05,878 --> 01:04:07,546
Mrs. Bee's Bakery

1154
01:04:07,546 --> 01:04:10,383
At Exactly 4:00.

1155
01:04:10,383 --> 01:04:11,417
Come Alone. No Cops.

1156
01:04:11,417 --> 01:04:13,152
No Cops.

1157
01:04:13,152 --> 01:04:16,889
I Want You To Purchase
A Large Sheet Cake...

1158
01:04:16,889 --> 01:04:18,326
And Have Them
Write On It--

1159
01:04:20,326 --> 01:04:21,427
I'm Trying To Use
The Phone, Man.

1160
01:04:21,427 --> 01:04:23,396
Excuse Me, You Know?

1161
01:04:23,396 --> 01:04:25,063
Get To Steppin'.
All Right.

1162
01:04:25,063 --> 01:04:27,733
Have Them Write
On It...

1163
01:04:27,733 --> 01:04:30,336
"The Itsy Bitsy Spider"

1164
01:04:30,336 --> 01:04:34,507
In Blue--No, Red Icing.

1165
01:04:34,507 --> 01:04:36,842
That Is Ludicrous.

1166
01:04:36,842 --> 01:04:37,944
Of Course It's Ludicrous!

1167
01:04:37,944 --> 01:04:40,112
That's The Point,
Van Dusen! Man!

1168
01:04:40,112 --> 01:04:41,948
You Want The Dog,
Don't You?

1169
01:04:41,948 --> 01:04:43,249
Tell Me
You Want The Dog.

1170
01:04:43,249 --> 01:04:45,184
Now, Listen Up,
All Right,

1171
01:04:45,184 --> 01:04:46,191
'Cause There's
A Little More.

1172
01:04:52,191 --> 01:04:53,359
Uh, Jay?

1173
01:04:53,359 --> 01:04:55,461
Why Can't We Just
Make One Poster

1174
01:04:55,461 --> 01:05:00,433
And Photocopy It,
Like, 300 Times?

1175
01:05:00,433 --> 01:05:03,669
Well, Van Dusen Wants Colorful,
Attractive Posters.

1176
01:05:03,669 --> 01:05:04,003
If They Were
All The Same,

1177
01:05:05,003 --> 01:05:07,174
People Would Start
Ignoring Them, Right?

1178
01:05:08,174 --> 01:05:09,509
Mm-Hmm.

1179
01:05:17,516 --> 01:05:19,819
All Right, Guys.
We Need 300 Posters.

1180
01:05:19,819 --> 01:05:22,731
So, Let's Pick Up
The Pace.

1181
01:06:05,731 --> 01:06:07,700
All Right, Guys. It's Time
To Assemble A Posting Team.

1182
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:09,769
I'll Lead,
And I'll Take, Um--

1183
01:06:09,769 --> 01:06:12,405
Oh, Oh, Oh!
Pick Me. Oh, Oh, Oh!

1184
01:06:12,405 --> 01:06:13,007
Oh...

1185
01:06:15,007 --> 01:06:16,175
Bill And Andy.

1186
01:06:16,175 --> 01:06:17,543
Yes!

1187
01:06:17,543 --> 01:06:18,878
Bill And Andy?

1188
01:06:18,878 --> 01:06:20,179
Are You Kidding?

1189
01:06:20,179 --> 01:06:22,681
I Thought Van Dusen
Wanted These Posters Up

1190
01:06:22,681 --> 01:06:23,849
By This Century.

1191
01:06:23,849 --> 01:06:25,451
They Haven't
Even Finished

1192
01:06:25,451 --> 01:06:26,018
Their First Poster.

1193
01:06:27,018 --> 01:06:29,388
Well, Guys, We Need
About 150 More.

1194
01:06:29,388 --> 01:06:32,459
So, Let's Keep 'Em Coming.
Here, Take That.

1195
01:06:33,459 --> 01:06:34,363
Come On.

1196
01:06:37,363 --> 01:06:39,098
Hey, Thanks, Jay.

1197
01:06:39,098 --> 01:06:41,032
This Is Way Cooler
Than Coloring.

1198
01:06:41,032 --> 01:06:42,701
Yeah, Way,
Way Cooler.

1199
01:06:46,605 --> 01:06:47,606
Here, Give Me
Some Of These.

1200
01:06:47,606 --> 01:06:50,209
Bill, We're Gonna
Have To Split Up

1201
01:06:50,209 --> 01:06:52,912
If We're Gonna Get All These Posters Up By Tonight.

1202
01:06:52,912 --> 01:06:55,581
Uh, Where Do You
Want 'Em Posted?

1203
01:06:55,581 --> 01:06:57,116
You Know What, Andy?

1204
01:06:57,116 --> 01:06:58,884
I'm Gonna Let
You Guys Decide

1205
01:06:58,884 --> 01:07:01,654
Where You Think The Most People Will Check 'Em Out.

1206
01:07:01,654 --> 01:07:03,489
Oh, And, Uh...

1207
01:07:03,489 --> 01:07:05,429

01:09:09,181 --> 01:09:10,856
Ok.

1249
01:09:17,856 --> 01:09:19,091
Here You Go.

1250
01:09:19,091 --> 01:09:20,768
Ok.

1251
01:09:29,768 --> 01:09:31,737
So, How Does It Look?

1252
01:09:31,737 --> 01:09:33,540
It Looks Great.

1253
01:09:35,541 --> 01:09:36,709
Oh, No, Wait!

1254
01:09:36,709 --> 01:09:38,210
Oh, Come Back!
Come Back!

1255
01:09:38,210 --> 01:09:39,945
Oh, No. He Got
Our Posters!

1256
01:09:39,945 --> 01:09:43,215
Hey, Give Us Back
Our Posters!

1257
01:09:43,215 --> 01:09:45,125
Oh, No, Come Back...

1258
01:09:57,129 --> 01:09:59,235
Still No Sign.

1259
01:10:03,235 --> 01:10:05,504
This Is Starting
To Look Suspicious.

1260
01:10:05,504 --> 01:10:07,512
We Better Try
Something Else.

1261
01:10:13,512 --> 01:10:15,514
Hey, Man!
Yo, There She Is!

1262
01:10:19,685 --> 01:10:21,088
Yes!

1263
01:10:24,088 --> 01:10:25,362
Oh, Yeah. We Got Her.
She's On The Line.

1264
01:10:30,362 --> 01:10:32,131
Aah!

1265
01:10:32,131 --> 01:10:33,715
Aah!

1266
01:10:49,715 --> 01:10:52,551
She's Gone!
Now What Are We Gonna Tell Van Dusen?

1267
01:10:52,551 --> 01:10:54,556
I Think We Need
A Little More Time.

1268
01:10:57,556 --> 01:10:59,325
I'm Gonna Have You The Dog By Friday, Sir.

1269
01:10:59,325 --> 01:11:00,325
Friday.

1270
01:10:59,325 --> 01:11:00,859
Absolutely.
My Promise.

1271
01:11:00,859 --> 01:11:01,860
I'm Not
Kidding Around.

1272
01:11:01,860 --> 01:11:02,861
All Righty, Then.
Bye-Bye.

1273
01:11:02,861 --> 01:11:04,129
I'm Tired
Of Your Excuses, Ward.

1274
01:11:04,129 --> 01:11:05,164
Yes, Sir. Bye-Bye.

1275
01:11:05,164 --> 01:11:06,565
The Dog Show Is Friday.
I Want That Dog--

1276
01:11:06,565 --> 01:11:07,733
Yes, Sir. Good-Bye.

1277
01:11:07,733 --> 01:11:09,804
Do You Know What
I'm Saying, Ward--

1278
01:11:14,139 --> 01:11:15,708
I'm Sorry, Sir. I Wasn't
Hanging The Phone Up--

1279
01:11:15,708 --> 01:11:17,242
What Happened,
You Sneaky Weasel?

1280
01:11:17,242 --> 01:11:18,877
Oh, It's You!
Listen To Me.

1281
01:11:18,877 --> 01:11:19,878
I Did Everything
You Asked Me To,

1282
01:11:19,878 --> 01:11:20,012
And You Still
Didn't Show Up.

1283
01:11:21,012 --> 01:11:22,381
You Called The Police,
Didn't You?

1284
01:11:22,381 --> 01:11:23,682
I Did No Such Thing.
You're Just Trying

1285
01:11:23,682 --> 01:11:24,983
To Make A Buffoon
Out Of Me.

1286
01:11:24,983 --> 01:11:26,218
I'm Done
With Your Games!

1287
01:11:26,218 --> 01:11:28,354
Hey, That Place Was
Swarming With Badges,

1288
01:11:28,354 --> 01:11:29,355
And You Know It.

1289
01:11:29,355 --> 01:11:30,356
Now, You Hold On
A Minute--

1290
01:11:30,356 --> 01:11:32,891
No, I Don't Have
A Minute, Van Dusen.

1291
01:11:32,891 --> 01:11:34,860
So, Listen Up, All Right?

1292
01:11:34,860 --> 01:11:37,196
4:30 Today.

1293
01:11:37,196 --> 01:11:40,899
Go By The, Uh,
Bowling Alley.

1294
01:11:40,899 --> 01:11:43,869
Get Yourself A Bright
Orange Bowling Ball.

1295
01:11:43,869 --> 01:11:46,872
I Want You To Bowl
10 Straight Frames

1296
01:11:46,872 --> 01:11:48,207
Of Gutter Balls.

1297
01:11:48,207 --> 01:11:50,876
Not One Pin Knocked Down,
You Understand Me, Mister?

1298
01:11:50,876 --> 01:11:54,346
The Last Frame, Your Ball
Will Be Returned To You

1299
01:11:54,346 --> 01:11:56,047
With A Note Attached

1300
01:11:56,047 --> 01:11:57,716
Telling You Where
To Find The Dog.

1301
01:11:57,716 --> 01:11:59,918
Oh, By The Way, Uh,

1302
01:11:59,918 --> 01:12:01,887
Does Your Wife
Have A Frilly Robe

1303
01:12:01,887 --> 01:12:03,198
And Some
Fluffy Slippers?

1304
01:12:13,198 --> 01:12:15,734
Yes! Goose Egg.

1305
01:12:16,802 --> 01:12:18,036
"O" For 10.

1306
01:12:18,036 --> 01:12:19,748
Guess It's
Not My Night.

1307
01:12:29,748 --> 01:12:31,717
Where's That Note?

1308
01:12:31,717 --> 01:12:33,051
I Want My Note!

1309
01:12:34,051 --> 01:12:35,988
Where's My Note?

1310
01:12:35,988 --> 01:12:38,457
You Promised Me A Note!

1311
01:12:38,457 --> 01:12:39,958
I Want It!
Give It To Me Now!

1312
01:12:39,958 --> 01:12:41,628
I Want That Note!

1313
01:12:44,563 --> 01:12:45,467
Oh, No!

1314
01:12:49,802 --> 01:12:51,603
Get Away. Get Away.

1315
01:12:51,603 --> 01:12:54,606
Mommy! Get Away.

1316
01:12:54,606 --> 01:12:56,009
Oh, Mommy!

1317
01:12:57,009 --> 01:12:57,010
There She Is.

1318
01:12:58,010 --> 01:13:00,145
See, I Told You
I Knew Her Voice.

1319
01:13:00,145 --> 01:13:01,747
You Don't Listen To
That Yapping All Night

1320
01:13:01,747 --> 01:13:03,515
Without Getting It
Burned Into Your Mind.

1321
01:13:03,515 --> 01:13:05,451
All Right Now.
Just Stay Behind Me, All Right?

1322
01:13:05,451 --> 01:13:07,786
She Might Make
A Run For It.

1323
01:13:07,786 --> 01:13:08,020
All Right, Come On.
Watch My Back.

1324
01:13:09,020 --> 01:13:10,456
All Right,
Come Here.

1325
01:13:10,456 --> 01:13:12,260
Come On, Stay Close.
Stay Close, Come On.

1326
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:17,796
Hi. Come Here, Girl.
Come Here, Camille.

1327
01:13:17,796 --> 01:13:18,797
Come Here, Dog.

1328
01:13:18,797 --> 01:13:20,132
Come On, Camille.

1329
01:13:20,132 --> 01:13:21,166
I Got Her.

1330
01:13:24,002 --> 01:13:25,671
All Right, Come On.
Get Her, Get Her, Get Her!

1331
01:13:27,005 --> 01:13:28,541
Whoa!

1332
01:13:29,541 --> 01:13:31,510
I Don't Believe It.

1333
01:13:31,510 --> 01:13:32,711
Me Neither.

1334
01:13:32,711 --> 01:13:34,613
Nice. Well Done,
Little Brother.

1335
01:13:34,613 --> 01:13:37,683
Come Here,
You Stupid Dog. Hello.

1336
01:13:42,187 --> 01:13:44,556
She Acts A Lot
More Normal Now.

1337
01:13:44,556 --> 01:13:45,657
Yeah.

1338
01:13:45,657 --> 01:13:47,125
I Guess All She Needed Was To Run Around

1339
01:13:47,125 --> 01:13:48,727
And Burn Off Some Energy,
You Know?

1340
01:13:48,727 --> 01:13:50,863
I Mean,
She Spends Half Her Life At The Groomer

1341
01:13:50,863 --> 01:13:52,030
And The Other Half
Going To Dog Shows.

1342
01:13:53,030 --> 01:13:55,200
She Just Needed
To Chill Out And Be

1343
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:57,536
A Regular Dog
For A While.

1344
01:13:57,536 --> 01:13:59,838
Now We Can Really Set Up
That Trade, You Know?

1345
01:13:59,838 --> 01:14:01,246
I Got A Good Feeling
About This, Jay.

1346
01:14:07,246 --> 01:14:08,014
I've Been Informed
That We're Up And Running

1347
01:14:09,014 --> 01:14:10,883
At Your House As Well.

1348
01:14:10,883 --> 01:14:12,184
Good.

1349
01:14:12,184 --> 01:14:14,186
I Want That Miscreant
Behind Bars

1350
01:14:14,186 --> 01:14:16,889
As Soon As Possible.

1351
01:14:16,889 --> 01:14:19,762
This Way, Son.

1352
01:14:23,762 --> 01:14:25,899
You, Uh...
You Wanted To--

1353
01:14:26,899 --> 01:14:28,835
What?

1354
01:14:29,835 --> 01:14:31,404
You Wanted
To See Me, Sir?

1355
01:14:32,404 --> 01:14:33,772
I Want 300 New
Posters, Martin,

1356
01:14:33,772 --> 01:14:35,207
With A Police Hotline
Number On 'Em.

1357
01:14:35,207 --> 01:14:36,710
Get On It Right Away.

1358
01:14:38,710 --> 01:14:40,045
Excuse Me, Excuse Me,
Excuse Me.

1359
01:14:40,045 --> 01:14:41,346
No Way.

1360
01:14:41,346 --> 01:14:42,714
No Way!

1361
01:14:42,714 --> 01:14:44,383
Excuse Me, Are You
Gonna Be Long?

1362
01:14:44,383 --> 01:14:46,184
'Cause I Have To Make
A Really Important--

1363
01:14:46,184 --> 01:14:47,185
Shh!

1364
01:14:47,185 --> 01:14:48,921
Are You Serious?

1365
01:14:48,921 --> 01:14:50,789
No Way.

1366
01:14:50,789 --> 01:14:52,424
No Way.

1367
01:14:52,424 --> 01:14:54,226
Really?

1368
01:14:54,226 --> 01:14:55,294
No Way.

1369
01:14:55,294 --> 01:14:57,268
No Way, No Way,
No Way.

1370
01:15:15,079 --> 01:15:16,381
Hello.

1371
01:15:16,381 --> 01:15:18,216
Hello For The Last
Time, Van Dusen.

1372
01:15:18,216 --> 01:15:19,217
What Do You Mean?

1373
01:15:19,217 --> 01:15:21,219
Well, Either We Settle
This Matter Today,

1374
01:15:21,219 --> 01:15:23,289
Or It Does Not
Get Settled At All.

1375
01:15:24,289 --> 01:15:25,490
Yeah, Right.

1376
01:15:25,490 --> 01:15:27,159
Yeah, Right.

1377
01:15:27,159 --> 01:15:28,760
I'm So Sure.

1378
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:30,629
No Way.

1379
01:15:30,629 --> 01:15:32,831
He Is Not.

1380
01:15:32,831 --> 01:15:35,434
She Is Not.

1381
01:15:35,434 --> 01:15:36,002
We Are Not!

1382
01:15:37,002 --> 01:15:38,770
This Is An Emergency.
I'm Really Sorry.

1383
01:15:38,770 --> 01:15:40,105
Oh!

1384
01:15:40,105 --> 01:15:42,407
Let's Just Keep It Nice
And Simple, All Right?

1385
01:15:42,407 --> 01:15:44,109
Let's Meet In A...

1386
01:15:44,109 --> 01:15:45,844
Simple Location
In A Secluded Part--

1387
01:15:46,845 --> 01:15:47,012
Oh, You Know What?
Hold On.

1388
01:15:48,012 --> 01:15:49,481
That's My Other Line.

1389
01:15:49,481 --> 01:15:51,483
He Put Me On Hold.

1390
01:15:51,483 --> 01:15:53,318
That's Excellent.
That Buys More Time.

1391
01:15:53,318 --> 01:15:55,354
We Just Need 2 Minutes.

1392
01:15:55,354 --> 01:15:56,521
Hello?

1393
01:15:56,521 --> 01:15:58,690
The Police Are Tapping
Van Dusen's Phone!

1394
01:15:58,690 --> 01:16:00,459
What?

1395
01:16:00,459 --> 01:16:02,160
I'm On The Other Line
With Him Right Now.

1396
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:04,963
Hang Up!
Hang Up Now!

1397
01:16:04,963 --> 01:16:06,465
Van Dusen?

1398
01:16:06,465 --> 01:16:08,433
Yes.

1399
01:16:08,433 --> 01:16:10,034
I Thought
Of A Place.

1400
01:16:10,034 --> 01:16:12,270
Uh, You Know?
I Gotta Go. Bye.

1401
01:16:12,270 --> 01:16:13,271
Ghee!

1402
01:16:13,271 --> 01:16:14,015
He Hung Up On Me.

1403
01:16:24,015 --> 01:16:25,952
Jay!

1404
01:16:26,952 --> 01:16:29,855
Hey, Jay!
Over Here.

1405
01:16:29,855 --> 01:16:32,190
Hey, Man, Any Sign?

1406
01:16:32,190 --> 01:16:34,993
No. The Trace Must Not
Have Gone Through.

1407
01:16:34,993 --> 01:16:37,295
We Can't Just
Turn Her In Now.

1408
01:16:37,295 --> 01:16:38,997
Well, Maybe We Can
Let Her Loose,

1409
01:16:38,997 --> 01:16:40,465
And Hopefully,
Someone Will Find Her.

1410
01:16:40,465 --> 01:16:42,534
What If She Gets
Hit By A Car?

1411
01:16:42,534 --> 01:16:43,869
I Can't Live
With That.

1412
01:16:43,869 --> 01:16:46,172
Look, It's Either
That Or We Go To Jail.

1413
01:16:47,172 --> 01:16:48,840
I Mean, Do You
Understand, Jay?

1414
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:51,043
Our Lives Could
Be Ruined By This.

1415
01:16:52,043 --> 01:16:53,512
Mike, Look.

1416
01:16:53,512 --> 01:16:56,482
I'm Sorry I Got You
Involved In This.

1417
01:16:57,482 --> 01:16:58,884
Look, If We
Get Arrested,

1418
01:16:58,884 --> 01:17:01,054
I Promise I Will
Take All The Blame.

1419
01:17:02,054 --> 01:17:03,522
And If I Wasn't
Such A Wimp,

1420
01:17:03,522 --> 01:17:04,023
None Of This Would
Have Ever Happened.

1421
01:17:05,023 --> 01:17:07,559
No, See. We're
In This Together.

1422
01:17:07,559 --> 01:17:10,596
And We'll Get Out
Of It Together.

1423
01:17:11,596 --> 01:17:12,731
Good.

1424
01:17:12,731 --> 01:17:14,332
'Cause I Think I Got
A Plan That'll Get Us

1425
01:17:14,332 --> 01:17:15,500
Out Of All Of This.

1426
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:17,202
All Right.
Well, Let's Hear It.

1427
01:17:17,202 --> 01:17:19,577
All Right. First...

1428
01:17:25,577 --> 01:17:28,214
So...

1429
01:17:29,214 --> 01:17:31,116
What Do You Think
Of My Disguise?

1430
01:17:31,116 --> 01:17:32,684
I Told You, Man.

1431
01:17:32,684 --> 01:17:34,020
It Looks Like You
Cut It Off The Dog.

1432
01:17:35,020 --> 01:17:36,689
Really?

1433
01:17:37,689 --> 01:17:39,193
It's 'Cause I Did.

1434
01:17:41,193 --> 01:17:42,894
I Don't Know About
This, Little Brother.

1435
01:17:42,894 --> 01:17:45,464
It Seems Really
Risky To Me.

1436
01:17:45,464 --> 01:17:48,266
It's Simple.
See, Look.

1437
01:17:48,266 --> 01:17:50,702
The Police Are In
The Main House.

1438
01:17:50,702 --> 01:17:51,737
So, I'll Just
Sneak Through

1439
01:17:51,737 --> 01:17:53,638
The Neighbors'
Backyards...

1440
01:17:53,638 --> 01:17:55,373
And Into
The Pool House.

1441
01:17:55,373 --> 01:17:56,708
But If Ronny's There,

1442
01:17:56,708 --> 01:17:58,210
You Just Distract Him
For A Little Bit.

1443
01:17:58,210 --> 01:17:59,478
It'll Be Fine.

1444
01:17:59,478 --> 01:18:01,046
I Guess...

1445
01:18:01,046 --> 01:18:02,481
But I Don't Really
Know A Whole Lot

1446
01:18:02,481 --> 01:18:03,749
About Bmx Bikes.

1447
01:18:03,749 --> 01:18:05,317
Just Wing It.

1448
01:18:05,317 --> 01:18:07,385
Ok, When You Hear
The Bird Call--

1449
01:18:07,385 --> 01:18:08,620
Caw, Caw--

1450
01:18:08,620 --> 01:18:10,122
Get Out Of There.

1451
01:18:10,122 --> 01:18:12,924
Hey, Did You Draw This
All From Memory?

1452
01:18:12,924 --> 01:18:13,959
Yeah.

1453
01:18:13,959 --> 01:18:15,961
It's Really Good, Jay.

1454
01:18:15,961 --> 01:18:17,430
Thanks.

1455
01:18:18,430 --> 01:18:19,998
All Right, Camille.

1456
01:18:19,998 --> 01:18:22,167
Ready To Go Home?

1457
01:18:22,167 --> 01:18:24,737
Oh, I'm Gonna
Miss You, Too.

1458
01:18:25,737 --> 01:18:27,840
So Long, Puppy Dog.

1459
01:18:29,841 --> 01:18:31,910
Shh! Quiet!
Quiet!

1460
01:18:31,910 --> 01:18:33,145
Don't Worry, Camille.
We're Just Gonna Take You

1461
01:18:33,145 --> 01:18:35,647
For A Little Walk
In The Basket, Ok?

1462
01:18:35,647 --> 01:18:39,753
Good Girl.
Who's A Good Dog?

1463
01:18:41,753 --> 01:18:43,922
How'd You Get Her
To Do That?

1464
01:18:44,923 --> 01:18:46,458
I Don't Know.

1465
01:18:46,458 --> 01:18:47,628
I Was Just
Nice To Her.

1466
01:18:50,595 --> 01:18:52,164
All Right.

1467
01:18:52,164 --> 01:18:53,865
Wish Me Luck.

1468
01:18:53,865 --> 01:18:55,167
You Don't Need Luck,
Little Brother.

1469
01:18:55,167 --> 01:18:56,128
It's A Good Plan.

1470
01:19:26,965 --> 01:19:28,867
Oh!

1471
01:19:30,368 --> 01:19:31,503
Go On, Suggs.

1472
01:19:31,503 --> 01:19:32,838
Go Outside.
Do Your Business.

1473
01:19:49,554 --> 01:19:52,056
Aah! Aah!

1474
01:19:52,056 --> 01:19:54,860
Aah, Get Off Of Me!
Get Away! Aah!

1475
01:19:54,860 --> 01:19:56,028
Oh, Aah, Aah!

1476
01:19:58,396 --> 01:20:00,699
Get Away From Me!
Get Away, Get Away!

1477
01:20:00,699 --> 01:20:02,067
Aah!

1478
01:20:02,067 --> 01:20:03,869
Come Here, Suggs!

1479
01:20:03,869 --> 01:20:05,838
Come On, Boy!

1480
01:20:06,838 --> 01:20:08,714
Good Boy, Suggs.

1481
01:20:22,454 --> 01:20:24,623
Hi. Who Are You?

1482
01:20:24,623 --> 01:20:27,759
Hi, I'm
Fred Fredrickson.

1483
01:20:27,759 --> 01:20:29,761
<I>Yeah, I'm A Reporter
From Bmx Magazine.</I>

1484
01:20:29,761 --> 01:20:31,396
I Was Wondering If You'd
Be Interested In Doing

1485
01:20:31,396 --> 01:20:33,531
A Small Review
For The Magazine?

1486
01:20:33,531 --> 01:20:37,034
Wait. Wait, How Did You
Know I Like Bmx Bikes?

1487
01:20:37,034 --> 01:20:38,703
Well, You Do Subscribe To The Magazine,
Don't You?

1488
01:20:38,703 --> 01:20:40,037
No. No, I Don't.

1489
01:20:40,037 --> 01:20:41,206
I Get My Issues
Up The Street.

1490
01:20:41,206 --> 01:20:42,941
Ok, Well,
You Know What?

1491
01:20:42,941 --> 01:20:43,942
If You're
Not Interested

1492
01:20:43,942 --> 01:20:45,076
In Getting
A Free Bmx Bike

1493
01:20:45,076 --> 01:20:46,611
For Writing A Real Kid's Review,
That's Ok--

1494
01:20:46,611 --> 01:20:48,113
No, Actually,
I'm Interested.

1495
01:20:48,113 --> 01:20:50,548
I--What Do I Do
To Get The Bike?

1496
01:20:50,548 --> 01:20:53,652
Well, Just Answer
A Few Questions For Us

1497
01:20:53,652 --> 01:20:54,819
To See
If You Qualify, Ok?

1498
01:20:54,819 --> 01:20:56,321
Let's Have 'Em.

1499
01:20:56,321 --> 01:20:58,657
Ok, Um, Questions.

1500
01:20:58,657 --> 01:21:02,296
Let's See What
We Got Here. Um...

1501
01:21:04,296 --> 01:21:08,065
Ok, Uh, Bmx Stands
For What, Exactly?

1502
01:21:09,167 --> 01:21:11,069
Uh, Bicycle Motocross.

1503
01:21:11,069 --> 01:21:12,170
Next.

1504
01:21:12,170 --> 01:21:13,005
Ok, Um...

1505
01:21:14,005 --> 01:21:17,853
Let's Go,
Let's Go, Let's Go...

1506
01:21:28,853 --> 01:21:30,803
Oh, Man.

1507
01:21:44,803 --> 01:21:45,870
Um...

1508
01:21:45,870 --> 01:21:48,873
Those Things That The Bmx Frame Rides On.

1509
01:21:48,873 --> 01:21:49,874
What Are
Those Called?

1510
01:21:49,874 --> 01:21:52,110
You Mean The Tires?

1511
01:21:52,110 --> 01:21:53,011
You're Good, Mister.

1512
01:21:54,011 --> 01:21:56,648
You're Really Good.

1513
01:21:56,648 --> 01:21:59,484
Ok, Um, Well...

1514
01:21:59,484 --> 01:22:01,051
To "Pop A Wheelie"
Means

1515
01:22:01,051 --> 01:22:02,687
To Do What
In Bmx Jargon?

1516
01:22:02,687 --> 01:22:04,356
These Questions
Are Ridiculous, And--

1517
01:22:04,356 --> 01:22:05,857
You Know What?
That's Wrong. I'm Sorry.

1518
01:22:05,857 --> 01:22:07,525
No, You Know What?
I Know The Answer.

1519
01:22:08,693 --> 01:22:09,961
I've Been Trying--

1520
01:22:09,961 --> 01:22:10,962
Oh--

1521
01:22:10,962 --> 01:22:12,063
I...

1522
01:22:12,063 --> 01:22:13,531
Zzz--Ok?

1523
01:22:13,531 --> 01:22:16,534
I Can Only Accept Your Initial Answer To The Question.

1524
01:22:16,534 --> 01:22:17,803
Next Question.

1525
01:22:18,803 --> 01:22:20,338
Oh.

1526
01:22:20,338 --> 01:22:21,406
What Was That?

1527
01:22:21,406 --> 01:22:22,574
Oh, Sorry.

1528
01:22:22,574 --> 01:22:24,342
I Had A Little Rumble
In My Stomach.

1529
01:22:24,342 --> 01:22:25,643
I'm A Little Hungry.

1530
01:22:25,643 --> 01:22:28,380
So, Tell Me, What
Kind Of Axel Grease

1531
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:32,417
Does Bmx Rider
Kai Vierstra Prefer?

1532
01:22:32,417 --> 01:22:33,418
What's The Guy's Name?

1533
01:22:33,418 --> 01:22:35,820
Uh, Kai Vierstra.

1534
01:22:35,820 --> 01:22:36,821
It's In The Throat.

1535
01:22:36,821 --> 01:22:38,821
Rrr...

1536
01:22:36,821 --> 01:22:38,356
Yeah, Uh-Huh.

1537
01:22:38,356 --> 01:22:39,357
I Don't Know.

1538
01:23:04,349 --> 01:23:05,683
Hello?

1539
01:23:05,683 --> 01:23:07,352
Hello, Mr. Van Dusen.

1540
01:23:07,352 --> 01:23:10,889
Sorry I Had To Hang Up
On You The Last Time.

1541
01:23:10,889 --> 01:23:12,690
I, Uh...

1542
01:23:12,690 --> 01:23:14,359
I Stubbed My Toe.

1543
01:23:14,359 --> 01:23:16,761
Anyway, This Is
Your Last Chance

1544
01:23:16,761 --> 01:23:18,864
To Get Your Dog Back,
So Listen Up.

1545
01:23:19,864 --> 01:23:21,699
I'm Listening.

1546
01:23:21,699 --> 01:23:23,368
Meet Me Behind
Fineman's Deli

1547
01:23:23,368 --> 01:23:24,402
In One Hour.

1548
01:23:24,402 --> 01:23:25,205
It's Secluded There.

1549
01:23:27,205 --> 01:23:28,373
Good-Bye,
Mr. Van Dusen.

1550
01:23:28,373 --> 01:23:29,042
No, Wait, Can--

1551
01:23:31,042 --> 01:23:32,578
He Hung Up.

1552
01:23:33,578 --> 01:23:34,646
No, He Didn't
Break The Connection.

1553
01:23:34,646 --> 01:23:35,248
We're Still Tracing.

1554
01:23:37,248 --> 01:23:38,322
Oh, We're
Gonna Get Him.

1555
01:23:44,322 --> 01:23:45,760
Come On.

1556
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:50,731
I'm Gonna Miss You.

1557
01:23:56,434 --> 01:23:57,237
Look...

1558
01:23:59,237 --> 01:24:02,340
I Don't Really Have Time
For A Long Good-Bye, But...

1559
01:24:02,340 --> 01:24:04,015
You Be Good, Ok?

1560
01:24:12,015 --> 01:24:14,586
Uh, Well...

1561
01:24:14,586 --> 01:24:16,588
Uh, Mars
Is The Fourth,

1562
01:24:16,588 --> 01:24:19,958
Fifth, Or Sixth
Planet From The Sun?

1563
01:24:19,958 --> 01:24:22,861
Wait, That Has Nothing
To Do With Bmx Bikes.

1564
01:24:22,861 --> 01:24:24,095
Bye, Camille.

1565
01:24:29,367 --> 01:24:31,369
Caw, Caw!

1566
01:24:31,369 --> 01:24:33,471
Oh, You Know What?
It's A Moot Point,

1567
01:24:33,471 --> 01:24:34,006
Because You Didn't
Pass The Test.

1568
01:24:35,006 --> 01:24:36,374
Wait, What Do You Mean,
I Didn't Pass?

1569
01:24:36,374 --> 01:24:37,374
I Got One Wrong.

1570
01:24:36,374 --> 01:24:37,475
No, No, No.

1571
01:24:37,475 --> 01:24:38,476
See, You Missed
The Whole

1572
01:24:38,476 --> 01:24:39,477
"Pop A Wheelie"
Question, And--

1573
01:24:39,477 --> 01:24:40,011
That's Still
One Wrong!

1574
01:24:41,011 --> 01:24:42,847
Thank You So Much For Playing.
I Appreciate Your Time, Ok,

1575
01:24:42,847 --> 01:24:45,150
But We've Got A Lovely Parting Gift For You Today.

1576
01:24:45,150 --> 01:24:47,019
<I>Please Enjoy These
Free Bmx Magazines.</I>

1577
01:24:48,019 --> 01:24:49,120
Have A Great Day, Ok?

1578
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:50,223
Buh-Bye.

1579
01:24:52,223 --> 01:24:53,972
I Won, Really.

1580
01:25:19,217 --> 01:25:21,020
It Says The Call Is Coming In From This Address.

1581
01:25:22,020 --> 01:25:24,757
It Can't Be.
We're All Right Here.

1582
01:25:25,757 --> 01:25:27,162
Except For...

1583
01:25:31,162 --> 01:25:32,864
Go, Go!

1584
01:25:49,046 --> 01:25:50,049
Hello?

1585
01:25:51,049 --> 01:25:53,352
Hello, Indeed.

1586
01:25:55,853 --> 01:25:58,389
Oh, Hey,
You Found Camille.

1587
01:25:58,389 --> 01:26:01,960
We Certainly Did, And I,
For One, Am Speechless.

1588
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:04,095
My Own Son. I Would
Never Have Guessed.

1589
01:26:04,095 --> 01:26:06,064
Oh, Is My Little Baby
All Right? Oh...

1590
01:26:06,064 --> 01:26:08,700
Is This What You Were
Gonna Do With The Money?

1591
01:26:08,700 --> 01:26:10,935
Buy A Bmxer I Already
Said You Couldn't Have?

1592
01:26:10,935 --> 01:26:14,105
First Of All, Stop
Calling It A Bmxer.

1593
01:26:14,105 --> 01:26:15,240
That's Not
What It Is.

1594
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:17,041
And Second Of All,

1595
01:26:17,041 --> 01:26:18,810
What Are You
Talking About?

1596
01:26:18,810 --> 01:26:20,311
Don't Play Innocent
With Us, Young Man.

1597
01:26:20,311 --> 01:26:21,946
Kidnapping
Your Own Mother's Dog.

1598
01:26:21,946 --> 01:26:23,381
How Low Can You Get?

1599
01:26:23,381 --> 01:26:27,223
I'd Say The Apple Doesn't Fall
Very Far From The Tree, Ward.

1600
01:26:32,223 --> 01:26:35,393
Everybody Wants To Get Where
They're Going As Fast As They Can.

1601
01:26:35,393 --> 01:26:37,996
Including Those With
Physical Challenges.

1602
01:26:37,996 --> 01:26:40,732
Our Town Can Make
Greater Efforts To Create

1603
01:26:40,732 --> 01:26:43,334
A More Handicapped
Accessible Environment

1604
01:26:43,334 --> 01:26:46,170
With The Addition
Of Moving Sidewalks

1605
01:26:46,170 --> 01:26:47,305
Throughout
The Entire Town,

1606
01:26:47,305 --> 01:26:51,175
And Automatic Doors
Outside Of Every Building.

1607
01:26:51,175 --> 01:26:52,844
We Could
Begin The Process

1608
01:26:52,844 --> 01:26:54,279
Of Reversing
Discrimination

1609
01:26:54,279 --> 01:26:56,015
Against The Physically
Challenged In Our World...

1610
01:26:57,015 --> 01:27:00,852
And Eventually,
In The Entire World.

1611
01:27:05,256 --> 01:27:09,127
You Just Heard Jay Martin's
Scholarship-Winning

1612
01:27:09,127 --> 01:27:11,663
Community Improvement
Presentation.

1613
01:27:11,663 --> 01:27:14,299
In Light Of Some
Recent Occurrences,

1614
01:27:14,299 --> 01:27:16,768
We Re-Opened
The Competition.

1615
01:27:16,768 --> 01:27:19,971
And So, Mr. Martin
Will Be Attending

1616
01:27:19,971 --> 01:27:21,873
The Donald Peterson
Academy

1617
01:27:21,873 --> 01:27:23,841
On A Full Scholarship.

1618
01:27:41,959 --> 01:27:44,295
Good Job, Man.
Well Done.

1619
01:27:44,295 --> 01:27:45,830
Thanks.

1620
01:27:45,830 --> 01:27:47,965
Come Here, Come Here.
Good Job.

1621
01:27:47,965 --> 01:27:49,835
Knucklehead!

1622
01:27:50,835 --> 01:27:52,804
Before We Call
The Graduates Up

1623
01:27:52,804 --> 01:27:54,505
To Receive Their
Diplomas,

1624
01:27:54,505 --> 01:27:57,742
I'll Make A Short Speech About
The Promise Of The Future,

1625
01:27:57,742 --> 01:28:00,411
Then You Will Introduce Our Key Note Speaker,

1626
01:28:00,411 --> 01:28:01,546
Nurse Ketcham.

1627
01:28:03,314 --> 01:28:05,216
You Buzzed, Sir?

1628
01:28:05,216 --> 01:28:06,018
Yes, Ward.

1629
01:28:07,018 --> 01:28:09,987
I'd Like Another
Orange Soda,

1630
01:28:09,987 --> 01:28:12,190
With Less Ice
This Time.

1631
01:28:12,190 --> 01:28:16,698
And Another Root Beer
For Mr. Martin.

1632
01:28:20,698 --> 01:28:22,533
Sorry To Interrupt,
Daddy,

1633
01:28:22,533 --> 01:28:25,336
But I Just Had To Stop By With The Good News.

1634
01:28:28,740 --> 01:28:30,875
Did You See That?

1635
01:28:30,875 --> 01:28:34,412
I've Never Seen Camille Take To Someone Like That.

1636
01:28:34,412 --> 01:28:37,081
Guess I... Just Have
A Way With Dogs.

1637
01:28:40,083 --> 01:28:43,087
This Dog Is An Excellent
Judge Of Character.

1638
01:28:44,222 --> 01:28:45,890
What Are You Doing
Here, Dear?

1639
01:28:45,890 --> 01:28:48,860
Oh, I Just Had To Come By.
I Couldn't Wait.

1640
01:28:48,860 --> 01:28:50,561
I Just Came From The Vet,

1641
01:28:50,561 --> 01:28:52,964
And He Said That Camille
Was Just Fine.

1642
01:28:52,964 --> 01:28:55,466
He Said That All This Time She
Was Probably Just Stressed!

1643
01:28:55,466 --> 01:28:57,735
That Couldn't Wait
Until I Got Home?

1644
01:28:57,735 --> 01:29:01,472
Ooh, No, This Couldn't.
It's The Most Wonderful News In The World.

1645
01:29:01,472 --> 01:29:04,977
Camille Is Going
To Have Puppies!

1646
01:29:05,977 --> 01:29:08,746
Of Course, I Want
To Keep Most Of Them.

1647
01:29:08,746 --> 01:29:12,250
But... Since Camille Seems To Like Jay So Much...

1648
01:29:12,250 --> 01:29:15,386
Would You Like One
Of Her Puppies?

1649
01:29:15,386 --> 01:29:16,954
Yeah, Thanks.

1650
01:29:16,954 --> 01:29:19,957
But The Puppies Will Play Havoc With My Allergies.

1651
01:29:19,957 --> 01:29:22,994
Oh, I Know.
With Ronny Off At School,

1652
01:29:22,994 --> 01:29:25,497
You Can Move Into
The Pool House.

1653
01:29:26,497 --> 01:29:28,064
It's For Your
Own Good.

1654
01:29:28,064 --> 01:29:29,500
Thank You, Dear.

1655
01:29:29,500 --> 01:29:31,169
Hey, Mr. Van Dusen.

1656
01:29:31,169 --> 01:29:33,171
Congratulations
On The Puppies.

1657
01:29:33,171 --> 01:29:36,277
It Couldn't Have Happened
To A Nicer Guy.

1658
01:29:39,277 --> 01:29:41,245
March... Left!

1659
01:29:41,245 --> 01:29:42,914
Left! Left!

1660
01:29:42,914 --> 01:29:44,482
March Left!

1661
01:29:44,482 --> 01:29:46,587
Platoon Halt!

1662
01:29:49,587 --> 01:29:51,087
I'm Proud Of You,
Son.

1663
01:29:51,087 --> 01:29:53,090
You've Whipped This Sorry Group Into Fine Shape.

1664
01:29:53,090 --> 01:29:54,625
Thank You, Sir!

1665
01:29:54,625 --> 01:29:56,695
Carry On.

1666
01:29:57,695 --> 01:30:00,099
About... Face!

1667
01:30:02,099 --> 01:30:04,535
Cadet Van Dusen!

1668
01:30:04,535 --> 01:30:08,105
What Is The Starkwell
Creed, Son?!

1669
01:30:08,105 --> 01:30:11,209
Always Try Harder!
Never Give Up, Sir!

1670
01:30:11,209 --> 01:30:13,377
What Are The 3 Rs,
Son?!

1671
01:30:13,377 --> 01:30:15,713
Rules, Regimen,
And Respect, Sir!

1672
01:30:15,713 --> 01:30:20,351
What Does Pop-A-Wheelie Mean To You?

1673
01:30:20,351 --> 01:30:21,019
Yeah!

1674
01:30:22,019 --> 01:30:24,222
Right...

1675
01:30:24,222 --> 01:30:26,159
Face!

1676
01:30:28,159 --> 01:30:31,061
Forward... March!

1677
01:30:31,061 --> 01:30:32,697
Left... Left...

1678
01:30:32,697 --> 01:30:34,032
Left, Right, Left.

1679
01:30:35,032 --> 01:30:36,901
Left, Left.

1680
01:30:36,901 --> 01:30:38,636
Left, Right, Left.

1681
01:30:38,636 --> 01:30:40,705
Left, Left.

1682
01:30:40,705 --> 01:30:42,000
Left, Right, Left.
