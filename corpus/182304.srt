1
00:02:10,453 --> 00:02:11,852
I want a car.

2
00:02:14,013 --> 00:02:15,685
Chicks dig the car.

3
00:02:15,893 --> 00:02:18,532
This is why Superman works alone.

4
00:02:26,373 --> 00:02:30,002
Do try and bring this one
back in one piece, sir!

5
00:02:58,693 --> 00:02:59,921
Don't wait up, Al.

6
00:03:00,093 --> 00:03:02,049
I'll cancel the pizzas.

7
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:18,732
Batman,

8
00:03:18,893 --> 00:03:21,043
a new villain has commandeered
the Gotham Museum.

9
00:03:21,213 --> 00:03:23,010
He's frozen
the antiquities wing.

10
00:03:23,253 --> 00:03:25,562
He's turned
the security guards into ice.

11
00:03:25,773 --> 00:03:27,923
He's calling himself, "Mr. Freeze. "

12
00:03:28,173 --> 00:03:29,891
Mr. Freeze.

13
00:03:52,213 --> 00:03:54,681
Stop! Drop your weapon...

14
00:03:54,893 --> 00:03:56,121
...or we'll shoot!

15
00:04:09,133 --> 00:04:10,964
The Iceman Cometh.

16
00:04:12,413 --> 00:04:14,563
Please, show some mercy.

17
00:04:14,973 --> 00:04:16,042
Mercy?!

18
00:04:18,173 --> 00:04:22,689
I'm afraid that my condition has
left me cold to your pleas of mercy.

19
00:04:40,253 --> 00:04:41,766
In this universe...

20
00:04:41,973 --> 00:04:44,328
...there's only one absolute.

21
00:04:46,093 --> 00:04:47,287
Everything...

22
00:04:47,973 --> 00:04:49,201
...freezes.

23
00:04:54,733 --> 00:04:55,643
Hi, Freeze.

24
00:04:55,853 --> 00:04:57,047
I'm Batman.

25
00:05:15,533 --> 00:05:17,524
You're not sending me to the cooler.

26
00:05:34,693 --> 00:05:35,603
Nice catch.

27
00:05:35,853 --> 00:05:37,172
You break it, you buy it.

28
00:05:37,373 --> 00:05:39,603
Grab the gem!
Kill the heroes!

29
00:05:53,493 --> 00:05:55,211
Kill them! Kill them!

30
00:05:56,213 --> 00:05:58,124
Destroy everything!

31
00:06:08,573 --> 00:06:10,131
It's the hockey team from hell.

32
00:06:43,453 --> 00:06:44,442
Get the ice...

33
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:46,092
...I'll get the Iceman.

34
00:07:11,213 --> 00:07:12,248
Thanks.

35
00:07:27,773 --> 00:07:28,922
Sweet.

36
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,090
I got mine.

37
00:07:34,773 --> 00:07:36,092
Where's yours?

38
00:07:37,653 --> 00:07:39,291
What killed the dinosaurs?

39
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:41,690
The Ice Age!

40
00:08:31,773 --> 00:08:32,922
Hit me, boys.

41
00:08:35,773 --> 00:08:37,491
Thanks for playing.

42
00:09:03,013 --> 00:09:05,004
I was hoping you'd drop in.

43
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:01,882
Watch the numbers...

44
00:10:02,053 --> 00:10:04,442
...for they are
the harbingers of your doom.

45
00:10:04,613 --> 00:10:05,602
Can you feel it coming?

46
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:08,566
The icy cold of space.

47
00:10:10,133 --> 00:10:13,728
At 30,000 feet,
your heart will freeze...

48
00:10:13,893 --> 00:10:16,043
...and beat no more.

49
00:10:25,133 --> 00:10:28,842
After you're frozen, your icy tomb
will plummet back to Gotham.

50
00:10:29,053 --> 00:10:30,452
Freeze, you're mad.

51
00:10:31,253 --> 00:10:33,289
This capsule explodes,
it'll slaughter thousands.

52
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:34,568
Freeze well.

53
00:10:57,213 --> 00:10:59,488
-Who invited you?
-I was hanging around.

54
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:02,366
I thought you'd stay in the museum,
round up some thugs.

55
00:11:02,573 --> 00:11:05,167
How about, "Nice to see you.
Thanks for saving my life. "

56
00:11:17,853 --> 00:11:18,603
A Batbomb?

57
00:11:18,813 --> 00:11:21,452
We must blow this up
before it turns Gotham into a crater.

58
00:11:23,613 --> 00:11:24,682
Now what, call a taxi?!

59
00:11:25,773 --> 00:11:26,762
Watch the first step!

60
00:11:27,933 --> 00:11:28,922
Surf's up!

61
00:12:02,373 --> 00:12:03,772
Gotcha!

62
00:12:09,533 --> 00:12:10,966
Cowabunga!

63
00:12:28,733 --> 00:12:31,042
He's freezing the furnace!

64
00:13:09,933 --> 00:13:11,048
I got him.

65
00:13:17,973 --> 00:13:18,928
Stay cool...

66
00:13:19,093 --> 00:13:20,492
...Birdboy.

67
00:13:29,853 --> 00:13:33,448
Can you be cold?
You have 11 minutes to thaw the bird.

68
00:13:33,613 --> 00:13:35,729
Will you chase the villain...

69
00:13:35,893 --> 00:13:36,803
...or save him?

70
00:13:38,013 --> 00:13:39,241
Emotion makes you weak.

71
00:13:39,773 --> 00:13:41,764
That's why this day is mine.

72
00:13:43,253 --> 00:13:45,084
I'll kill you next time!

73
00:14:28,173 --> 00:14:29,242
Did we get him?

74
00:14:42,573 --> 00:14:43,562
Drats!

75
00:14:43,733 --> 00:14:48,443
My experiment to mate the orchid and
the rattlesnake has failed again...

76
00:14:49,133 --> 00:14:53,490
...but I still have hope for
the animal-plant crossbreedings.

77
00:14:55,173 --> 00:14:57,368
If I can only find
the right dose of venom...

78
00:14:57,613 --> 00:15:00,889
...these plants will be able to
fight back, like animals.

79
00:15:01,613 --> 00:15:03,331
I will have given flora...

80
00:15:03,533 --> 00:15:07,890
...a chance against
the thoughtless ravages of man.

81
00:15:10,973 --> 00:15:12,326
Personal note:

82
00:15:12,893 --> 00:15:14,770
My work would proceed faster...

83
00:15:14,973 --> 00:15:18,329
...if Dr. Woodrue didn't whisk
my venom samples...

84
00:15:18,573 --> 00:15:21,246
...back to his mysterious
Gilgamesh Wing.

85
00:15:21,853 --> 00:15:23,969
Why won't he let me in the lab?

86
00:15:26,053 --> 00:15:28,089
What is he doing in there?

87
00:15:44,733 --> 00:15:49,011
Ladies and gentlemen
of the un-United Nations...

88
00:15:49,173 --> 00:15:50,492
...and...

89
00:15:52,173 --> 00:15:53,606
...our mystery bidder...

90
00:15:53,973 --> 00:15:55,611
...may I present...

91
00:15:55,813 --> 00:15:57,804
...Antonio Diego...

92
00:15:58,373 --> 00:16:01,331
...serial murderer, serving life...

93
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:02,403
...in prison...

94
00:16:02,613 --> 00:16:04,490
...and sole surviving...

95
00:16:04,733 --> 00:16:06,212
...volunteer.

96
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:09,764
And what a charmer he is.

97
00:16:10,813 --> 00:16:15,204
By merely drilling three
concentric holes directly...

98
00:16:15,533 --> 00:16:19,082
...into Antonio's cranial cavity...
I have...

99
00:16:19,293 --> 00:16:23,127
...created viaducts into
the most primitive part of his brain...

100
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:25,849
...the limbic system.

101
00:16:28,173 --> 00:16:30,050
And now I add...

102
00:16:30,213 --> 00:16:32,124
...my Super-Soldier Serum...

103
00:16:32,813 --> 00:16:33,848
...code-named...

104
00:16:34,413 --> 00:16:35,368
... "Venom" ...

105
00:16:35,533 --> 00:16:38,605
...to which I add
my very own recipe of steroids...

106
00:16:38,813 --> 00:16:40,405
...and toxins.

107
00:16:42,173 --> 00:16:43,606
Plug him in.

108
00:16:43,813 --> 00:16:45,212
Time to scream.

109
00:17:17,533 --> 00:17:18,932
Genius!

110
00:17:19,213 --> 00:17:20,248
Behold...

111
00:17:20,493 --> 00:17:23,007
...the ideal killing machine!

112
00:17:23,253 --> 00:17:25,289
I call this little number...

113
00:17:25,773 --> 00:17:26,842
... "Bane. "

114
00:17:27,293 --> 00:17:29,284
Bane of Humanity!

115
00:17:30,253 --> 00:17:31,288
Imagine it.

116
00:17:31,933 --> 00:17:35,562
Your own private army made up of
thousands of these super-soldiers.

117
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:38,051
Bidding begins at a mere...

118
00:17:38,253 --> 00:17:39,606
... 10 million!

119
00:17:39,853 --> 00:17:40,729
Turbo!

120
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:42,891
Show off for Daddy.

121
00:18:23,013 --> 00:18:24,287
Dr. Isley.

122
00:18:26,613 --> 00:18:28,729
Welcome to my parlor.

123
00:18:29,973 --> 00:18:30,962
What?

124
00:18:31,613 --> 00:18:32,568
You monster!

125
00:18:32,933 --> 00:18:34,286
How could you?!

126
00:18:34,493 --> 00:18:37,690
Our original sponsor had
no stomach for military applications.

127
00:18:37,853 --> 00:18:39,889
He cut the funding for our work.

128
00:18:40,413 --> 00:18:41,892
Without your research...

129
00:18:42,133 --> 00:18:43,566
...I couldn't have come this far.

130
00:18:43,733 --> 00:18:44,609
Join me.

131
00:18:44,813 --> 00:18:47,930
The two of us,
entwined, side by side.

132
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:48,889
Join you?

133
00:18:49,653 --> 00:18:53,931
I have spent my life trying to
protect plants from extinction...

134
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,407
...and now you...

135
00:18:55,613 --> 00:18:57,843
...corrupt my research...

136
00:18:58,133 --> 00:19:01,523
...into some maniacal scheme for
world domination.

137
00:19:02,813 --> 00:19:05,122
When I get through...

138
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:09,804
...you won't be able to get a job
teaching high school chemistry.

139
00:19:10,013 --> 00:19:11,366
Do you hear me?!

140
00:19:11,533 --> 00:19:13,649
You psycho!

141
00:19:15,893 --> 00:19:17,008
Well...

142
00:19:17,213 --> 00:19:19,090
...I can respect your opinion.

143
00:19:19,253 --> 00:19:21,847
Sadly, I'm not good at rejection.

144
00:19:22,013 --> 00:19:24,049
I'm afraid you'll have to die.

145
00:19:48,733 --> 00:19:52,408
Let the poisons and toxins
burn a grave for you...

146
00:19:52,573 --> 00:19:55,133
...deep into the earth
you love so much!

147
00:19:55,293 --> 00:19:56,851
Bye-bye, dear!

148
00:19:57,373 --> 00:19:58,692
Fellow maniacs...

149
00:19:58,933 --> 00:20:00,446
...bidding...

150
00:20:00,653 --> 00:20:02,291
...begins!

151
00:20:08,573 --> 00:20:12,361
Gotham University Labs
security video, 2 years ago.

152
00:20:13,933 --> 00:20:15,366
Dr. Victor Fries...

153
00:20:15,573 --> 00:20:19,691
...2-time Olympic decathlete and Nobel
Prize winner for molecular biology.

154
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:22,323
After his wife
contracted a rare disease...

155
00:20:22,493 --> 00:20:23,721
...Macgregor's Syndrome...

156
00:20:23,933 --> 00:20:26,970
...he hoped to freeze her in a cryogenic
sleep until he could find a cure.

157
00:20:27,133 --> 00:20:29,693
Now, here's where
everything goes north.

158
00:20:36,413 --> 00:20:37,528
That's got to hurt.

159
00:20:37,813 --> 00:20:40,008
That liquid is 50 below.

160
00:20:40,213 --> 00:20:42,169
But, he survived somehow.

161
00:20:42,933 --> 00:20:45,322
The cryo-solution mutated his body.

162
00:20:50,013 --> 00:20:52,368
-What happened to his wife?
-No one knows.

163
00:20:52,533 --> 00:20:53,966
She's presumed dead.

164
00:20:54,173 --> 00:20:56,050
Freeze needs
extreme cold to survive.

165
00:20:56,213 --> 00:21:00,968
His cryo-suit uses diamond-enhanced
lasers to keep him at zero degrees.

166
00:21:02,293 --> 00:21:05,171
If it's ice the Iceman wants....

167
00:21:15,373 --> 00:21:16,442
Coming, sir.

168
00:21:18,013 --> 00:21:19,207
Yes, sir?

169
00:21:19,573 --> 00:21:21,086
We need the Wayne diamonds.

170
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:22,971
We going to trap a snowman?

171
00:21:23,893 --> 00:21:27,602
Yes, right after you spend
10 hours in the simulator, training.

172
00:21:27,773 --> 00:21:31,049
I made a mistake. I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

173
00:21:31,253 --> 00:21:33,209
You were reckless
and almost got killed.

174
00:21:33,373 --> 00:21:35,568
I'm fine! See!
Me, here, alive!

175
00:21:35,933 --> 00:21:38,766
How we supposed to work together
if you won't trust me?

176
00:21:41,813 --> 00:21:43,565
How indeed?

177
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:46,123
He's overeager, he's impulsive.

178
00:21:46,293 --> 00:21:48,523
I can't trust him not to get hurt.

179
00:21:49,133 --> 00:21:52,523
Perhaps the truth is
you really don't trust anyone.

180
00:21:52,973 --> 00:21:55,851
Don't tell me
you're on his side again.

181
00:21:56,533 --> 00:21:58,763
Despite all your talents...

182
00:21:58,973 --> 00:22:02,010
...you're still just
a novice in the ways of family.

183
00:22:02,173 --> 00:22:02,969
Master Dick...

184
00:22:03,293 --> 00:22:05,488
...follows the same star as you...

185
00:22:05,853 --> 00:22:08,572
...but gets there by his own course.

186
00:22:09,293 --> 00:22:12,729
You must learn to trust him,
for that is the nature of family.

187
00:22:13,693 --> 00:22:15,445
I trust you, Alfred.

188
00:22:16,533 --> 00:22:18,763
But I shan't be here forever.

189
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:23,885
Good night, Master Bruce.

190
00:22:26,173 --> 00:22:27,367
Good night, Alfred.

191
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:49,044
Oh, dear, Master Bruce.

192
00:22:49,213 --> 00:22:51,522
Good gracious, what a tumble.

193
00:22:51,773 --> 00:22:53,809
There's a brave boy.

194
00:23:02,653 --> 00:23:03,290
Yes, sir.

195
00:23:03,453 --> 00:23:07,287
I am so pleased you won the bidding,
Your Supreme Ruthlessness.

196
00:23:07,573 --> 00:23:10,531
We're making the final modifications
on Bane right now.

197
00:23:10,733 --> 00:23:15,363
We'll have a flawless super-soldier
out to you tomorrow by overnight mail.

198
00:23:35,573 --> 00:23:37,370
Dr. Isley?

199
00:23:38,293 --> 00:23:39,885
Pamela?

200
00:23:41,173 --> 00:23:42,447
You look great.

201
00:23:43,093 --> 00:23:45,084
Especially for a dead woman.

202
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,930
Hello, Jason.

203
00:23:49,173 --> 00:23:51,767
I think I've had a change of heart.

204
00:23:52,053 --> 00:23:53,202
Or quite...

205
00:23:53,373 --> 00:23:54,647
...literally...

206
00:23:55,773 --> 00:23:59,561
...the animal-plant toxins had
a rather unique effect on me.

207
00:23:59,733 --> 00:24:02,293
They replaced my blood with aloe...

208
00:24:02,453 --> 00:24:05,411
...my skin with chlorophyll...

209
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:07,132
...and filled...

210
00:24:07,373 --> 00:24:09,045
...my lips...

211
00:24:19,893 --> 00:24:21,121
...with venom.

212
00:24:24,533 --> 00:24:26,410
And, Jason, one other thing.

213
00:24:27,293 --> 00:24:30,763
I probably
should have mentioned this earlier...

214
00:24:31,733 --> 00:24:32,722
...I'm...

215
00:24:33,653 --> 00:24:34,881
...poison.

216
00:24:41,373 --> 00:24:43,045
It's a jungle in here.

217
00:24:44,413 --> 00:24:46,085
I am Nature's arm...

218
00:24:46,973 --> 00:24:48,531
...her spirit...

219
00:24:49,413 --> 00:24:50,163
...her will!

220
00:24:51,413 --> 00:24:53,722
Hell, I am Mother Nature.

221
00:24:53,933 --> 00:24:55,810
And the time has come...

222
00:24:56,053 --> 00:24:57,805
...for plants to take back...

223
00:24:58,013 --> 00:25:00,686
...the world so rightfully ours...

224
00:25:00,893 --> 00:25:02,326
...because it's not nice...

225
00:25:03,613 --> 00:25:06,081
...to fool with Mother Nature.

226
00:25:11,933 --> 00:25:14,003
"Wayne Enterprises. "

227
00:25:18,293 --> 00:25:20,124
Coming, Bane, darling.

228
00:25:20,653 --> 00:25:22,291
We've got a plane to catch.

229
00:25:37,493 --> 00:25:40,007
I'm Mr. Icicle

230
00:25:40,293 --> 00:25:42,045
I'm Mr. Ten Below

231
00:25:42,213 --> 00:25:43,612
Sing! Sing!

232
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:50,845
Come on, sing!

233
00:25:52,053 --> 00:25:53,327
Louder! Come on!

234
00:25:53,533 --> 00:25:55,330
Sing! Sing! Sing!

235
00:25:55,533 --> 00:25:57,205
He's Mr. White Christmas

236
00:25:57,653 --> 00:25:58,881
Louder!

237
00:26:00,613 --> 00:26:02,092
He's Mr. Icicle

238
00:26:03,133 --> 00:26:04,452
Freezy...

239
00:26:04,893 --> 00:26:06,611
...I'm feeling hot.

240
00:26:06,813 --> 00:26:08,644
I find that unlikely.

241
00:26:09,333 --> 00:26:12,689
So my hair is
brittle and my skin is dry...

242
00:26:12,893 --> 00:26:14,963
...I'd weather blizzards to have you.

243
00:26:15,213 --> 00:26:17,647
You're the most perfect man
I've ever known.

244
00:26:17,813 --> 00:26:19,849
Let's heat things up.

245
00:26:20,093 --> 00:26:22,482
My passion thaws
for my bride alone.

246
00:26:24,253 --> 00:26:26,448
Talk about your cold shoulder.

247
00:26:32,013 --> 00:26:32,684
Frosty!

248
00:26:32,893 --> 00:26:34,042
Yeah, boss?

249
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,321
Energy.

250
00:26:37,453 --> 00:26:39,921
Battling the Bat
exhausted my power.

251
00:26:44,573 --> 00:26:45,562
But...

252
00:26:46,693 --> 00:26:48,968
...I was successful nevertheless.

253
00:26:50,093 --> 00:26:51,367
Absolutely, boss.

254
00:26:51,573 --> 00:26:54,041
One more giant diamond of this size...

255
00:26:54,213 --> 00:26:57,091
...and my freezing engine
will be complete.

256
00:27:00,133 --> 00:27:01,532
I will freeze the city.

257
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:04,692
Then I will hold Gotham ransom.

258
00:27:04,853 --> 00:27:07,162
Unless the city bows
to my demands...

259
00:27:07,373 --> 00:27:09,045
...it's winter forever
in Gotham.

260
00:27:09,653 --> 00:27:11,962
The city fathers
will have no choice...

261
00:27:12,173 --> 00:27:15,927
...but to give me the billions
I need to complete my research...

262
00:27:18,093 --> 00:27:20,084
...so I can find a cure.

263
00:27:21,333 --> 00:27:22,686
Leave us.

264
00:27:22,893 --> 00:27:23,962
Sure, boss.

265
00:27:25,973 --> 00:27:28,043
We need quality time.

266
00:27:43,933 --> 00:27:46,731
Soon we will be together
once more.

267
00:27:47,693 --> 00:27:49,172
Soon.

268
00:28:11,253 --> 00:28:12,322
I'll get it.

269
00:28:22,253 --> 00:28:24,892
I must've dozed off.
My sincerest apologies.

270
00:28:25,133 --> 00:28:26,612
No apology necessary.

271
00:28:26,853 --> 00:28:29,492
It's the first time it's happened
in thirty years.

272
00:28:41,973 --> 00:28:43,611
Please be looking for me.

273
00:28:43,893 --> 00:28:46,646
Actually, I'm looking for
Alfred Pennyworth.

274
00:28:51,013 --> 00:28:52,492
Uncle Alfred!

275
00:28:52,733 --> 00:28:54,007
My dear.

276
00:28:54,173 --> 00:28:55,891
Oh, my dear...

277
00:28:56,093 --> 00:28:58,448
...what a most wonderful surprise.

278
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:01,486
How did you manage
to come here all the way from England?

279
00:29:01,693 --> 00:29:04,366
My dear, you are so kind
to your old uncle.

280
00:29:04,933 --> 00:29:05,888
Uncle?

281
00:29:09,093 --> 00:29:12,403
Barbara is the daughter
of my dear sister Margaret.

282
00:29:12,933 --> 00:29:16,209
Both my parents were killed
in a car accident 5 years ago.

283
00:29:16,373 --> 00:29:18,648
Uncle Alfred's been supporting me
ever since.

284
00:29:18,853 --> 00:29:20,525
-You have?
-Secrets, Al?

285
00:29:20,733 --> 00:29:24,692
Secrets are a virtual prerequisite
in this house.

286
00:29:24,893 --> 00:29:26,485
Don't you think, sir?

287
00:29:26,933 --> 00:29:27,843
I'm on break from--

288
00:29:28,053 --> 00:29:30,965
Oxbridge Academy,
Alfred's alma mater.

289
00:29:31,293 --> 00:29:34,012
The new computer sciences division.

290
00:29:34,213 --> 00:29:37,046
-How'd you know?
-Says so on the patch on your sweater.

291
00:29:42,053 --> 00:29:45,329
-What is it? It's beautiful.
-You can say that again.

292
00:29:45,893 --> 00:29:48,532
It's a competition racer.
I've been fixing it up.

293
00:29:48,733 --> 00:29:49,961
I'll show you how to ride it.

294
00:29:50,173 --> 00:29:51,891
You certainly will not!

295
00:29:52,093 --> 00:29:55,563
Don't worry, Uncle Alfred.
I'm terrified of these things.

296
00:29:55,733 --> 00:29:57,849
Barbara, I hope you'll stay with us.

297
00:29:58,493 --> 00:29:59,926
Oh, I don't know.

298
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:03,170
All this luxury really isn't
my style, but...

299
00:30:03,933 --> 00:30:05,082
...yeah, I'd love to.

300
00:30:05,693 --> 00:30:06,967
Then it's settled.

301
00:30:07,453 --> 00:30:09,523
But, sir, we...

302
00:30:09,853 --> 00:30:11,923
...we do get so busy here.

303
00:30:12,093 --> 00:30:13,162
Don't be silly.

304
00:30:13,413 --> 00:30:14,926
After all, she's family.

305
00:30:31,653 --> 00:30:32,608
Uncle Alfred?

306
00:30:34,693 --> 00:30:36,411
I came to tuck you in.

307
00:30:36,613 --> 00:30:38,808
You came to tuck me in?

308
00:30:39,093 --> 00:30:40,731
That's quite a switch.

309
00:30:42,013 --> 00:30:43,412
What're you working on?

310
00:30:43,613 --> 00:30:46,969
I'm trying to find my brother,
your Uncle Wilfred.

311
00:30:47,333 --> 00:30:50,928
He's first butler
to the Maharajah of Miranjapore.

312
00:30:51,133 --> 00:30:53,966
But Miranjapore is a floating court.

313
00:30:54,173 --> 00:30:55,891
It travels through India.

314
00:30:56,093 --> 00:30:57,845
I remember Mom getting postcards.

315
00:30:58,013 --> 00:31:01,050
So Wilfred can be
rather difficult to find.

316
00:31:02,333 --> 00:31:05,405
I don't suppose they have
fax machines on elephants.

317
00:31:07,173 --> 00:31:09,528
I've been trying to reach him
with no success.

318
00:31:10,373 --> 00:31:13,206
When one grows ancient,
one yearns for family.

319
00:31:15,453 --> 00:31:18,172
I have the same picture of Mom
by my bed.

320
00:31:18,493 --> 00:31:19,403
Peg?

321
00:31:19,653 --> 00:31:22,121
My nickname for sweet Margaret.

322
00:31:24,773 --> 00:31:26,809
It's good to see you again.

323
00:31:27,653 --> 00:31:28,722
I've missed you.

324
00:31:29,813 --> 00:31:31,610
As I have you.

325
00:31:32,893 --> 00:31:34,326
Sleep well, child.

326
00:31:35,573 --> 00:31:37,052
You sleep.

327
00:31:39,053 --> 00:31:40,725
Go to bed.

328
00:32:43,133 --> 00:32:44,407
Good morning, Gotham.

329
00:32:44,573 --> 00:32:49,169
It's Gossip Gerty reporting to you
direct from the Gotham Observatory...

330
00:32:49,373 --> 00:32:53,685
... where billionaire Bruce Wayne,
chairman of Wayne Enterprises...

331
00:32:53,893 --> 00:32:58,648
...is about to make yet another
legendary contribution to the city.

332
00:32:59,773 --> 00:33:02,162
Gotham Observatory, Bane.

333
00:33:02,693 --> 00:33:04,285
And step on it.

334
00:33:05,253 --> 00:33:06,527
Step.

335
00:33:14,973 --> 00:33:19,444
My father told me, "To succeed,
we need only pick a star and follow it. "

336
00:33:20,253 --> 00:33:24,212
So Wayne Enterprises is donating
the world's most advanced telescope...

337
00:33:24,453 --> 00:33:27,445
... to Gotham's
Observatory Restoration Project.

338
00:33:27,653 --> 00:33:28,847
With any luck...

339
00:33:29,133 --> 00:33:31,852
...this telescope will give
future generations a chance...

340
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:34,004
...to follow their own stars.

341
00:33:36,293 --> 00:33:37,248
Brucy...

342
00:33:37,493 --> 00:33:41,281
...is it true that this new telescope
can see around the globe?

343
00:33:41,493 --> 00:33:44,087
Yes. If you'll watch
these monitors right here.

344
00:33:45,053 --> 00:33:49,569
Satellites in orbit allow us to reflect
light from anywhere on the planet.

345
00:33:50,013 --> 00:33:53,210
From here, we'll be able
to see the sky anywhere on Earth...

346
00:33:53,413 --> 00:33:56,052
...and through this
intricate network of satellites...

347
00:33:56,253 --> 00:34:00,405
...reflect it back to our
very own Gotham City for observation.

348
00:34:01,213 --> 00:34:02,851
Just don't point it at my bedroom.

349
00:34:07,813 --> 00:34:10,486
Brucy, you and the exquisite
Julie Madison...

350
00:34:10,693 --> 00:34:12,172
...have been going out forever.

351
00:34:12,413 --> 00:34:14,483
Are you going to tie the knot?

352
00:34:14,693 --> 00:34:15,443
Marriage?

353
00:34:15,653 --> 00:34:17,530
Marriage?

354
00:34:17,693 --> 00:34:19,888
You want to give me a hand here?

355
00:34:20,413 --> 00:34:22,483
Bruce and I are recklessly in love.

356
00:34:22,653 --> 00:34:26,202
And that's most certainly
enough for us...for now.

357
00:34:27,613 --> 00:34:30,446
If you will follow me,
I'll show you the central control grid.

358
00:34:30,853 --> 00:34:32,411
You're a lot of help.

359
00:34:34,133 --> 00:34:35,452
Miss, you need to stop.

360
00:34:35,653 --> 00:34:36,847
Move, fascist bulldog!

361
00:34:37,013 --> 00:34:39,129
-You need an appointment--
-No, I don't!

362
00:34:39,333 --> 00:34:42,131
Miss, you're not authorized
to be up here.

363
00:34:42,333 --> 00:34:43,448
She has no pass, sir.

364
00:34:43,613 --> 00:34:46,286
Little overly protective,
but you won't hurt me, Miss--?

365
00:34:46,493 --> 00:34:48,051
Dr. Pamela Isley.

366
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:49,368
Doctor...

367
00:34:49,693 --> 00:34:51,012
...what can I do for you?

368
00:34:51,453 --> 00:34:53,489
Actually, I already
work for you, or did.

369
00:34:53,733 --> 00:34:56,247
Your arboreal preservation project
in South America.

370
00:34:56,933 --> 00:34:59,925
We cut our funding.
There was a conflict of ideologies.

371
00:35:00,093 --> 00:35:01,651
Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.

372
00:35:01,853 --> 00:35:02,922
I see you knew him.

373
00:35:03,173 --> 00:35:06,006
Yes. That lab burnt down last week.
I'm glad you escaped.

374
00:35:07,293 --> 00:35:11,286
I have here a proposal showing
how Wayne Enterprises can immediately...

375
00:35:11,453 --> 00:35:14,331
...cease all actions
that toxify our environment.

376
00:35:14,493 --> 00:35:16,723
Forget the stars,
look here at the earth...

377
00:35:16,933 --> 00:35:18,412
...our mother, our womb.

378
00:35:18,653 --> 00:35:21,565
She deserves your loyalty
and protection.

379
00:35:22,493 --> 00:35:24,245
And yet, you spoil her lands...

380
00:35:24,893 --> 00:35:25,962
...poison her oceans...

381
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:27,322
...blacken her skies!

382
00:35:27,613 --> 00:35:28,728
You're killing her!

383
00:35:29,413 --> 00:35:33,167
Your intentions are noble,
but no diesel fuel for heat...

384
00:35:33,373 --> 00:35:38,003
...no coolants to preserve food,
millions of people would die.

385
00:35:38,213 --> 00:35:40,807
Acceptable losses
in the battle to save the planet.

386
00:35:41,653 --> 00:35:43,848
People come first, Dr. Isley.

387
00:35:45,853 --> 00:35:46,968
Mammals!

388
00:35:47,773 --> 00:35:49,684
A day of reckoning is coming.

389
00:35:49,853 --> 00:35:50,922
That's right.

390
00:35:51,093 --> 00:35:53,687
The same plants and flowers
that saw you...

391
00:35:54,733 --> 00:35:56,644
...crawl from the primordial soup...

392
00:35:56,853 --> 00:36:00,971
...will reclaim this planet
and there will be no one to protect you!

393
00:36:04,893 --> 00:36:06,929
You must be new in town.

394
00:36:07,133 --> 00:36:08,043
In Gotham City...

395
00:36:08,213 --> 00:36:10,443
...Batman and Robin protect us...

396
00:36:10,653 --> 00:36:13,167
...even from plants and flowers.

397
00:36:16,413 --> 00:36:18,165
Maybe you'd like to meet them.

398
00:36:18,773 --> 00:36:21,082
Caped crusaders are
going to help us auction...

399
00:36:21,293 --> 00:36:23,727
...a diamond to raise money
for our botanical gardens.

400
00:36:24,413 --> 00:36:28,372
Just a few mammals doing what
we can for the world's plants.

401
00:36:28,733 --> 00:36:30,132
Thank you all for coming.

402
00:36:30,293 --> 00:36:31,521
Good day, Doctor.

403
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:42,643
Batman and Robin...

404
00:36:43,133 --> 00:36:46,443
...militant arm
of the warm-blooded oppressors...

405
00:36:47,213 --> 00:36:50,728
...animal protectors of the status quo.

406
00:36:51,773 --> 00:36:53,172
First...

407
00:36:53,333 --> 00:36:56,882
...I'll rid myself of the fur
and feathered pests.

408
00:36:58,013 --> 00:37:00,004
And then Gotham...

409
00:37:00,213 --> 00:37:01,646
...will be mine...

410
00:37:01,853 --> 00:37:03,525
...for the greening.

411
00:37:23,973 --> 00:37:25,122
Excuse me, chief.

412
00:37:25,373 --> 00:37:27,887
I got something here
you might want to see.

413
00:37:34,533 --> 00:37:37,127
I hate when people talk
during the movie.

414
00:37:55,733 --> 00:37:57,803
One more diamond, my love.

415
00:37:58,773 --> 00:38:00,411
One more.

416
00:38:07,413 --> 00:38:09,608
"Bruce Wayne. Diamonds. "

417
00:38:11,933 --> 00:38:13,161
Very nice.

418
00:38:56,213 --> 00:38:58,647
Ladies and gentlemen...

419
00:39:00,013 --> 00:39:02,652
...Gossip Gerty
of "Good Morning Gotham" and I...

420
00:39:02,813 --> 00:39:06,852
...welcome you
to the gem of the evening.

421
00:39:07,893 --> 00:39:10,168
Our own Commissioner Gordon...

422
00:39:10,613 --> 00:39:11,841
...displaying...

423
00:39:12,053 --> 00:39:15,284
...the famed Heart of Isis,
on loan...

424
00:39:15,493 --> 00:39:19,850
...from the collection of my
close personal friend, Bruce Wayne.

425
00:39:22,973 --> 00:39:24,565
Think Freeze will take the bait?

426
00:39:24,933 --> 00:39:26,252
He'll be here.

427
00:39:27,013 --> 00:39:29,573
...to dance with one
of our fabulous flowers...

428
00:39:29,733 --> 00:39:33,203
...the famed diamond
draped around her neck.

429
00:39:35,733 --> 00:39:38,327
Let's start the bidding!

430
00:39:38,813 --> 00:39:41,247
I'll give 10,000 for the orchid!

431
00:39:43,253 --> 00:39:45,448
20,000 for the tiger lily!

432
00:39:47,453 --> 00:39:48,522
And I bid...

433
00:39:48,733 --> 00:39:52,328
...30,000 dollars
for the lovely magnolia!

434
00:39:57,573 --> 00:39:59,131
Boys, please...

435
00:39:59,493 --> 00:40:01,131
...let's show some gusto!

436
00:42:03,133 --> 00:42:04,282
Hi, there.

437
00:42:05,053 --> 00:42:07,123
And you are?

438
00:42:07,533 --> 00:42:09,125
Poison...

439
00:42:09,333 --> 00:42:10,812
...Poison Ivy.

440
00:42:20,973 --> 00:42:23,567
Why not send junior home early?

441
00:42:23,973 --> 00:42:27,124
I've got some wild oats to sow.

442
00:42:28,733 --> 00:42:30,451
On the other hand...

443
00:42:31,733 --> 00:42:34,406
...youth does have its advantages.

444
00:42:35,133 --> 00:42:37,567
Endurance, stamina.

445
00:42:38,173 --> 00:42:40,448
Forget the geriatric Bat.

446
00:42:40,733 --> 00:42:42,212
Come, join me.

447
00:42:42,413 --> 00:42:44,563
My garden needs tending.

448
00:42:45,053 --> 00:42:46,452
I'll take it from here, pal.

449
00:42:46,613 --> 00:42:48,683
Wouldn't you like the earrings too?

450
00:42:49,493 --> 00:42:53,645
Some lucky boy's
about to hit the honey pot.

451
00:42:53,933 --> 00:42:57,767
I'll include an evening of my company
for the winner.

452
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:00,768
I'll bring everything you see here...

453
00:43:00,933 --> 00:43:04,164
...plus everything you don't.

454
00:43:05,893 --> 00:43:08,691
I bid 50,000 dollars for Poison Ivy!

455
00:43:12,373 --> 00:43:13,488
100,000!

456
00:43:14,813 --> 00:43:15,962
And I'll bid...

457
00:43:16,173 --> 00:43:19,245
...500,000 dollars!

458
00:43:21,053 --> 00:43:22,122
One million dollars.

459
00:43:23,733 --> 00:43:25,849
-2 million.
-You don't have it. 3 million.

460
00:43:26,053 --> 00:43:27,452
I'll borrow it from you. Four.

461
00:43:28,693 --> 00:43:29,523
5 million.

462
00:43:29,693 --> 00:43:31,251
That's a utility belt, not a money belt.

463
00:43:31,453 --> 00:43:32,408
6 million.

464
00:43:32,573 --> 00:43:33,449
7 million.

465
00:43:36,853 --> 00:43:38,252
Never leave the cave without it.

466
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:41,843
You boys aren't going to start fighting
over little old me, now are you?

467
00:43:55,053 --> 00:43:57,203
All right, everyone!
Chill.

468
00:43:58,453 --> 00:43:59,283
Chill.

469
00:44:08,213 --> 00:44:09,123
Get the gun!

470
00:44:51,373 --> 00:44:52,931
Look at you!

471
00:44:53,133 --> 00:44:54,930
Let me guess.

472
00:44:55,533 --> 00:44:56,727
Plant Girl?

473
00:44:57,093 --> 00:44:58,811
Vine Lady?

474
00:44:59,533 --> 00:45:01,683
Hand over the diamond, Garden Gal...

475
00:45:01,853 --> 00:45:03,605
...or I'll turn you into mulch.

476
00:45:08,413 --> 00:45:09,812
Pheromone dust...

477
00:45:10,773 --> 00:45:11,967
...designed to heat...

478
00:45:12,173 --> 00:45:13,492
...a man's blood.

479
00:45:13,933 --> 00:45:16,242
Doesn't work on the cold-hearted.
If you please!

480
00:45:17,213 --> 00:45:19,169
If you insist.

481
00:45:22,573 --> 00:45:24,928
Clever little clover.

482
00:45:28,853 --> 00:45:30,923
That's my exit cue.

483
00:45:31,373 --> 00:45:32,567
Thanks.

484
00:45:43,533 --> 00:45:44,568
Good night.

485
00:45:46,653 --> 00:45:48,211
Cool party!

486
00:46:14,613 --> 00:46:17,650
Commissioner, you have 11 minutes
to thaw these people.

487
00:46:23,933 --> 00:46:27,687
Miss Ivy, you've just met
one of the most sinister men in Gotham.

488
00:46:28,093 --> 00:46:30,004
That's not a man...

489
00:46:30,173 --> 00:46:32,084
...that is a god.

490
00:46:37,973 --> 00:46:39,804
Enough monkey business.

491
00:46:40,653 --> 00:46:42,769
We've got work to do.

492
00:46:43,613 --> 00:46:45,126
Monkey work.

493
00:47:33,813 --> 00:47:35,132
You can't make the jump.

494
00:47:35,333 --> 00:47:36,402
I can!

495
00:47:39,053 --> 00:47:39,769
Pull back!

496
00:47:40,213 --> 00:47:41,202
I can make it!

497
00:47:41,413 --> 00:47:42,926
Redbird control codes.

498
00:47:45,813 --> 00:47:47,041
Disable engine.

499
00:47:48,893 --> 00:47:50,042
Don't do it to me! !

500
00:47:58,013 --> 00:47:59,207
We won't make it!

501
00:48:21,333 --> 00:48:23,369
It's a cold town.

502
00:48:53,493 --> 00:48:54,926
I could've made that jump.

503
00:48:55,213 --> 00:48:57,886
You could've splattered your brains
on the building's side.

504
00:48:58,053 --> 00:48:59,691
The Flying Graysons were a team.

505
00:48:59,933 --> 00:49:01,764
We had to trust each to do his job.

506
00:49:01,933 --> 00:49:03,889
That's what being partners is about.

507
00:49:04,093 --> 00:49:06,402
Counting on someone is the way to win.

508
00:49:06,613 --> 00:49:08,808
Your head wasn't on the job.
It was on Poison Ivy.

509
00:49:09,373 --> 00:49:11,443
Maybe she wanted me instead of you.

510
00:49:11,653 --> 00:49:13,325
That's your idea of friendship?

511
00:49:13,493 --> 00:49:16,053
It's your rules.
It's your way, or the highway.

512
00:49:16,253 --> 00:49:18,767
It's Batman and Robin,
not Robin and Batman.

513
00:49:18,973 --> 00:49:22,010
-I'm sick of it!
-Yes, it's my rules that keep us alive.

514
00:49:22,173 --> 00:49:25,404
If you want to stay in this house,
on this team, you'll abide by them.

515
00:49:26,533 --> 00:49:28,012
This is no partnership.

516
00:49:28,253 --> 00:49:29,686
You're never going to trust me!
