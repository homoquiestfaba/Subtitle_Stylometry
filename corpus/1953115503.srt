VOGEL: 1-6, We've got a possible
IED blocking our patrol.

3
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,101
Request EOD.
What's the ETA on that?

4
00:01:40,226 --> 00:01:44,146
MAN ( on headphones): <i>Warrior 1-1, Warrior 1-6.
Standby for EOD ETA. Over</i>

5
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:50,778
Shake it off, Vogel. C'mon.

6
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:53,989
Fresh?

7
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:57,201
As a baby's ass, my friend.

8
00:01:57,284 --> 00:02:00,121
Maybe the Collector will get
a good chunk of wool out of this.

9
00:02:00,204 --> 00:02:01,539
The who?

10
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:05,709
First, let's see if Little Bo Peep
had a Russian 130 for breakfast.

11
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:12,967
Is the relative recency of the sheep's
mortification a good sign or bad?

12
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,303
Where you from again, Sully?

13
00:02:16,387 --> 00:02:18,597
St. Paul.

14
00:02:18,681 --> 00:02:23,060
Yeah, I know you're fresh as this Hadji
road kill, but talk like a Red Bull, yo.

15
00:02:23,144 --> 00:02:24,395
Sully, give me the 203.

16
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:27,523
Affirmative, Sergeant.

17
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:31,443
Fire Team leader requesting permission
to use a 203, Sergeant.

18
00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:35,823
Why, because you think you're a better
shot than me, Lodermeier? Denied.

19
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:38,409
A word, Sergeant?

20
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:39,827
Walk and duck.

21
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:50,337
Hey, now, if you remember Camp Ripley,
better shot is a freakin' understatement.

22
00:02:50,421 --> 00:02:52,381
You suck.

23
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,553
Weapon, Sergeant.

24
00:02:57,678 --> 00:03:01,140
Sully, riddle me this.

25
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:04,602
When you're using a grenade launcher,
what is more important?

26
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:08,564
Accuracy or safety?

27
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:12,693
The two aspects in question are
not mutually exclusive, Sergeant.

28
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:14,820
Intrinsically speaking.

29
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:21,952
Does that translate to English as both?

30
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:28,042
Wow. Follow me.

33
00:04:01,784 --> 00:04:03,994
Definitely a danger close.

34
00:04:04,078 --> 00:04:06,747
Yeah, come on, let's just do this.

35
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,082
No, no, no, no.

36
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,591
What do we have here?

37
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:33,190
If Scooby Doo is hungry enough,
he might just do the job for us.

38
00:04:33,274 --> 00:04:34,316
Come on, let's clear.

39
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:38,529
Shit, wire!

40
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:45,202
Oh... god.

41
00:04:45,286 --> 00:04:46,495
- Can you move?
- Yeah.

42
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:48,289
Get over here!

43
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:55,129
Come on.

44
00:04:57,756 --> 00:04:59,049

- No, we're good.

49

shrapnel wound.

54
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:51,268
Vogel, whaddya doing?

55
00:05:51,352 --> 00:05:55,898
You're a strong son of a bitch,
you know that?

56
00:05:57,775 --> 00:05:59,109
Nice piece for the Collection.

I'll take good care of him, Kyle.

60
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:40,692
What's the Collection?

61
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:46,657
I must've seen it a hundred times
in his tackle box.

62
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:51,245
Then one day I finally said to Grandpa,
"Grandpa, where'd you get this thing?"

63
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:53,747
Did he answer?

64
00:06:53,831 --> 00:06:58,001
Tells me he was a flamethrower on
Peleliu. He torches a pillbox, right?

65
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:01,922
And this Japanese officer and two
foot soldiers come chargin' out.

66
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:03,715
His buddies take out the two
foot soldiers,

67
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:08,846
but the officer comes bearing down on him.
One buddy shoots him in the bayonet,

68
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:11,890
he goes down, gets back up
with his service revolver.

69
00:07:11,974 --> 00:07:15,227
So Grampa lays into him with the torch.

70
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:21,650
Handle's toast see? And there's the dent.
He kept it for guttin' catfish.

71
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:24,403
We talked a lot after that.

72
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:29,950
Said I was his confidant.
Just 'cuz I asked, I guess.

73
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:32,870
Where'd you say you were from again?

74
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:36,165
- Uh, Midwest.
- Oh.

75
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:39,793
Ever catch a barbel in the Euphrates?
I hear they're delicious.

76
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:48,051
'Night, Lieutenant Tripp.

77
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:49,261
Goodnight, Private.

78
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:51,138
Goodnight, Lieutenant Tripp.

79
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:53,682
Not so fast, Sergeant.

80
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:55,684
Back to your unit tomorrow, eh?

81
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:57,728
Then home in ten days, ma'am.

82
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,605
So, I still have a chance?

83
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:02,608
I'm a married man, Lieutenant.

84
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:05,027
That's not what I meant.

85
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:08,155
Before you leave, I'm going to
unearth one detail of your life

86
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:11,825
besides your
name, rank and squad nickname.

87
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:14,203
Did they have good fishing
where you're from?

88
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:17,539
All questions, no answers. Nice.

89
00:08:17,623 --> 00:08:20,209
It's called "ask, don't tell."

90
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:24,213
All right. I coach little league baseball.

91
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:27,508
My favorite meal is a burger with ketchup
and mayo, not mustard.

92
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:33,222
And my biggest pet peeve is the phrase
"it is what it is." There you go.

93
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:37,559
That's not exactly what I was
after, but it's a start.

94
00:08:37,643 --> 00:08:38,977
What more do you want, ma'am?

95
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:45,234
Even Greek warriors collected souvenirs,
soldier, but you're different.

96
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:47,277
I would have given you
that shrapnel myself, you know.

97
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:51,156
Can't risk getting the wrong one, ma'am.

98
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,283
I gave it my best shot.

99
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:58,622
You can take your secrets to the grave like
every other tough guy, Mr. Collector.

100
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,415
Ma'am?

101
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,587
Have you ever heard of Le Center,
Minnesota?

102
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:13,011
( steps approaching )

103
00:10:12,154 --> 00:10:14,615
Yellow Warbler.

104
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:22,122
( running steps approaching )

105
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:24,666
Halt!

106
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,215
What are your orders?

107
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:36,678
Always maintain walking posture
while entering the porch sector, sir!

108
00:10:36,762 --> 00:10:39,264
Help your grandma.

109
00:10:39,348 --> 00:10:41,183
Oh, thanks, Kylie.

110
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:44,561
Cookies!
Hey, no fair.

111
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:46,980
We haven't earned our treats yet,
Ruthy.

112
00:10:47,064 --> 00:10:49,358
Something must have got in the water.

113
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:52,194
When I was your age,
all I wanted to do was play outside.

114
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:53,904
It's boring.

115
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:56,948
Boring?

116
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:06,458
Eyes crusty. Ears full of wax.

117
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:12,589
Jamie my boy, you just don't know
what to look or listen for.

118
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:15,967
Well, you can start by looking
for each other.

119
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:20,972
45 minutes of hide and seek, starting now.
That goes for all my grandkids.

120
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:24,476
Justin, you're outside my jurisdiction.

121
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:28,814
And no shouting.
I'm listening for the meadowlark.

122
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:30,565
The eastern meadowlark.

123
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:32,025
Yes, Opa.

124
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:34,736
I'm too old for hide and seek.

125
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,572
I want to play Mortal Kombat.

126
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:41,368
KYLE:
Do what Opa says.

127
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:42,786
Real tough guy.

128
00:11:44,246 --> 00:11:46,748
Picking on a bunch of little kids.

129
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:50,335
You build them up, I break them down.
That's how it works.

130
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:53,588
- Uh-uh.
- What?

131
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:56,550
You haven't earned your treats either.

132
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:05,142
Cheapskate.

133
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:09,438
Would you bring me some lemonade?

134
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:34,463
Hm.

135
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:55,734
Are we going in the barn?

136
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:58,361
Okay, Justin, here's the deal.

137
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,655
The goal is not to get found, right?

138
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:03,116
But what if we hide in the same place?

139
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,367
Ruthy finds both of us.

140
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:06,661
Exactly. See? You're smart.

141
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:11,541
So I know you can think of an even better spot
than this silly old barn. Can you do that?

142
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:20,550
RUTH: Ready or not, here I come!

143
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:06,555

Trust me, you'll only make him angry.

149
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:45,070
Now put that back.

150
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:47,989
Go on. Put it back.

Do as I say now, Kylie.

156
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:47,132
Are you deaf?
I told you to put that back.

157
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:49,676
I said, "No running!"

158
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:56,516
What is the reason
for your pig-headedness, child?

159
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:58,643
It's Memorial Day.

160
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,272
You're damn straight it is.

161
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:05,316
What am I supposed to remember?

162
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:29,299

Three.

170
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:13,384
Deal.

171
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:23,311
TRIPP: You were a bold little bastard,
weren't you?

172
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:25,897
Well, that's why he respects me, ma'am.

173
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,566
So, he's still alive?

174
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:32,445
Probably sitting on the rocking chair
sipping Oma's lemonade

175
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:37,534

the eastern meadowlark.

176
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:41,204
What did you pick first?

177
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:46,126
With all due respect, Lieutenant Tripp,
what do you think a young boy would pick?

178
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:25,748
Is this a Luger?

179
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:28,418
Walther P38.

180
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:42,307
It's a good one, Kylie.

181
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,559
What do you say we save this one
for last?

182
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:50,315
I'll make you another deal.

183
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:54,027
I'll talk to you like a man,
and you act like one.

184
00:19:57,655 --> 00:20:03,161
And promise me,
no matter what I tell you,

185
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:05,163
I'll always be your Opa.

186
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:06,581
Okay.

187
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:24,015
Operation Market Garden.

188
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:28,186
Sounds nice, doesn't it?

189
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:33,358
Well, it wasn't.

190
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:39,030
It was the largest, airborne operation
in the history of the war. In Holland.

191
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:50,083
BUD: We were headed
for the Maas bridge in Grave.

192
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:53,628
Drop had been easier than expected.

193
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:56,756
Anything was better than Normandy.

194
00:20:56,839 --> 00:21:02,804
But everyone knew it was a suicide mission.
Except Montgomery, of course.

195
00:21:04,514 --> 00:21:05,890
Gorski, gimme a cigarette.

196
00:21:08,518 --> 00:21:11,521
Come on, hayseed,
it might be my last one.

197
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:16,985
He asks, sir, but he never offers.

198
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:27,578
Hey! Thanks, Lieutenant.
Now that's a leader.

199
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:38,798
It's all right, Califano.
You keep it.

200
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:53,563
You always tell me not to get involved in
the petty stuff, let them work it out.

201
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:56,649
It's true, for you.

202
00:21:58,401 --> 00:22:02,238
What was your favorite season
growing up?

203
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:04,741
Never thought about it.

204
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:06,534
Mine was fall.

205
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:08,911
Nice leaves in South Bend?

206
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:12,081
Blood red maples all the way down
Longfellow Avenue.

207
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:17,837
Then you set them on fire or stuff them in bags.
Never understood that.

208
00:22:19,464 --> 00:22:21,507
That's get this bridge, Sarge.

209
00:22:22,592 --> 00:22:24,344
Hey! Germans!

210
00:22:24,427 --> 00:22:26,387
Germans! Germans!

211
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:44,781
Don't move!

212
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:47,075
Get security pushed out.
I don't want any more surprises!

213
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:49,077
Yes, sir!
I want two men pushed forward.

214
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,536
Two on the right side.

215
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,080
All right, get these men loaded up.

216
00:22:52,163 --> 00:22:57,960
No time. We're two hours behind schedule,
Lieutenant.

217
00:22:58,044 --> 00:23:00,505
Don't even think about trying that
shit with me!

218
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:03,174
Donnelly, get his weapon.

219
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:06,469
He's just one guy, Lieutenant.

220
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:09,639
How many All-Americans
we got in this thing?

221
00:23:11,349 --> 00:23:13,351
( speaking German )

222
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:22,026
( continues )

223
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:24,362
What's he saying?

224
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:38,418
My son.

225
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:42,588
Aw, Jesus.

226
00:24:00,815 --> 00:24:03,818
We're moving out.

227
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:08,406
Have you a family?

228
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:27,341
My son.

229
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:32,680
My son.

230
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:16,724
<i>( soft music )</i>

231
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:44,085
Is that a cardinal?

232
00:25:52,927 --> 00:25:58,140
You know, some people say we're
different from other animals.

233
00:25:58,224 --> 00:26:01,644
I didn't used to believe it.

234
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:04,689
Now I do.

235
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:06,649
Wanna know why?

236
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:08,943
Yeah.

237
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:12,530
Because we can do one thing they can't.

238
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:19,287
Kill at a distance.

239
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:34,427
Cedar Waxwing.

240
00:26:38,389 --> 00:26:43,185
All right, Mrs. O'Malley.
Bye-bye.

241
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:47,481
Justin, your parents need you back
for chores, dear.

242
00:26:47,565 --> 00:26:49,275
Is Kyle going to be okay?

243
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:56,073
He's going to be just fine. Now,
you can use the back door. Bye-bye.

244
00:26:57,241 --> 00:27:00,119
Is Opa sad?

245
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:02,830
Oh, Ruthy.

246
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:07,043
Do you remember when you skinned your knee
riding your scooter last summer?

247
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:09,003
She wasn't wearing kneepads.

248
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:11,589
- No fair.
- Ow.

249
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:14,383
And we put a bandage on it, right?

250
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:18,346
And then when it was all better,
we took the bandage off.

251
00:27:18,429 --> 00:27:21,182
But that hurt almost as much as the owy.
Didn't it?

252
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:23,476
Does Opa have any owy?

253
00:27:26,771 --> 00:27:28,981
I don't see it.

254
00:27:29,065 --> 00:27:32,193
How old were you when your grandpa
told you all this?

255
00:27:32,276 --> 00:27:34,070
I was 13, ma'am.

256
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:36,697
Did you even know he had been
in the war?

257
00:27:36,781 --> 00:27:41,035
I did, but I knew not to talk about it.

258
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:45,956
The strictest rules in any family
are the ones never spoken, right?

259
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,166
Yes, ma'am.

260
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:49,502
So, why push it?

261
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:53,381
You gotta know the rules in order
to break them. Right, ma'am?

262
00:27:53,464 --> 00:27:55,591
And you were the only one
not afraid of him?

263
00:27:55,675 --> 00:27:59,011
Oh, I was scared as hell that day.

264
00:27:59,095 --> 00:28:01,722
By his stories?

265
00:28:01,806 --> 00:28:03,432
No.

266
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:05,768
What then?

267
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:08,979
His face.

268
00:28:09,063 --> 00:28:12,233
It was like there was something...

269
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:15,319
melting away.

270
00:28:15,403 --> 00:28:17,196
His burdens?

271
00:28:20,658 --> 00:28:22,660
His protection.

272
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:33,295
Well?

273
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:34,922
Well, what?

274
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:38,050
What the heck you waiting for?
Pick another one.

275
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:02,616
What is this from?

276
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,201
My ass.

277
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:10,416
By way of a German potato masher.

278
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:12,960
Know what that is?

279
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:15,004
Want to hear about it?

280
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:17,047
Give it to me.

281
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:30,394
Captain Marshall.

282
00:29:30,478 --> 00:29:34,398
Another day in paradise, eh,
Lieutenant?

283
00:29:34,482 --> 00:29:36,609
Something on your mind, Lieutenant?

284
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:40,446
Beside the fact that there are enemy
artillery spotters watching us right now?

285
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:43,073
I suppose you have an
"alternate strategy."

286
00:29:43,157 --> 00:29:47,286
We could dig in on the reverse slope and
put observation posts here, here and here.

287
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:48,704
That way we'll
have men come from the east...

288
00:29:48,788 --> 00:29:52,708
If the Germans take this road, Lieutenant, our
trucks can't pass and the offensive stalls.

289
00:29:52,792 --> 00:29:56,837
Third Platoon has to hold,
and you're their sole protection.

290
00:29:56,921 --> 00:30:02,718
Look, Vogel, you and I know three things.

291
00:30:02,802 --> 00:30:04,887
The Krauts are going to
steamroll your flank.

292
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:09,642
This is still the best plan. And you're
the only one I trust who can do it.

293
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:11,852
Take it as a compliment.

294
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:16,482
May I request a spotting round
before dark, sir?

295
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:19,026
Yeah, we've got extra 81-mills.
You could have three, four.

296
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:21,070
Just one.
We'll keep them guessing.

297
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:25,783
Oh, Lieutenant? One more thing.

298
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:27,701
Yes, sir.

299
00:30:27,785 --> 00:30:29,620
Merry Christmas.

300
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:51,684
I can't believe this shit.

301
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:56,146
Yeah, me, neither. Figured most guys
would have gone chicken shit.

302
00:30:58,649 --> 00:31:00,734
You're happy about this?

303
00:31:00,818 --> 00:31:04,113
I'm happy Vogel is my commander
and not you.

304
00:31:21,922 --> 00:31:23,883
Morning, Sarge.

305
00:31:23,966 --> 00:31:25,259
Morning, Private.

306
00:31:35,728 --> 00:31:37,855
Gorski, smokes.

307
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:44,320
Listen up, gentlemen.

308
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:47,072
We've got a spotting round coming
in. Don't get too excited.

309
00:31:47,156 --> 00:31:49,158
Yes, sir.

310
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:50,451
Gorski?

311
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:51,785
Yes, sir.

312
00:31:55,623 --> 00:31:58,000
Damn it, Gorski!

313
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:01,337
We got a spotting round coming in.

314
00:32:04,632 --> 00:32:06,759
No distractions, okay, Gorski?

315
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:08,052
Yes, sir.

316
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,370
I don't know about you, but I think we're
going to see action sooner than expected.

317
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:35,537
I'm gonna take a scout team.

318
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:39,708
You stay with Brandt and Donnelly,
I'll take Gorski and Califano.

319
00:32:39,792 --> 00:32:42,962
If you see or hear anything, call in the mortars.
We'll stay in the pines.

320
00:32:43,045 --> 00:32:44,213
Yes, sir.

321
00:32:57,977 --> 00:33:01,188
<i>( ominous music )</i>

322
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:31,719
Give me those.

323
00:33:40,686 --> 00:33:43,856
Shit, give me the radio.

324
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:50,029
Mortars, this is First Platoon. I need a target
Alpha Baker 0-1-2 immediate fire for effect.

325
00:33:50,112 --> 00:33:51,947
O'HARA:
Give 'em all you got!

326
00:35:37,678 --> 00:35:40,848
<i>( music continues )</i>

327
00:35:53,402 --> 00:35:54,570
Masher!

328
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:58,198
Lieutenant!

329
00:35:58,282 --> 00:35:59,658
( grunts )

330
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:09,293
Let's get him out of here.
Come on.

331
00:36:24,433 --> 00:36:27,811
Covering fire! Covering fire!

332
00:36:57,216 --> 00:37:00,427
<i>( somber music )</i>

333
00:37:01,762 --> 00:37:05,432
Come on!

334
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:08,393
You're gonna be all right, Lieutenant.

335
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:15,525
You sure these things are good
luck, Private?

336
00:37:15,609 --> 00:37:17,653
My ass ain't the one bleeding, sir.

337
00:37:27,788 --> 00:37:31,541
So, where is the rosary?

338
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:39,424
Come on,
let's get some more lemonade.

339
00:37:46,348 --> 00:37:47,391
( door slams shut )

340
00:37:47,474 --> 00:37:49,351
( humming )

341
00:37:54,231 --> 00:37:55,482
What are you looking for, Opa?

342
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:58,610
Should be a pitcher of lemonade
in here somewhere.

343
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:11,331
Take that outside, will you?

344
00:38:15,002 --> 00:38:17,879
Whoa! Not so fast, buster.

345
00:38:19,298 --> 00:38:20,674
Lemonade!

346
00:38:20,757 --> 00:38:21,800
( glass smashing )

347
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:23,135
Damn it, Ruthy!

348
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:24,469
BETTY: Bud!

349
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:28,640
Don't worry, Oma, I got it.

350
00:38:28,724 --> 00:38:31,852
It's okay. It's okay, sweetheart.

351
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:33,228
I know it was an accident.

352
00:38:33,312 --> 00:38:36,523
It was thoughtless.
Shame on you!

353
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:39,776
Is he really telling you about the war?

354
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,369
Can I join you guys, Opa?

355
00:38:49,453 --> 00:38:51,913
There's nothing going on out there.

356
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:54,374
Just two men talking.

357
00:39:02,716 --> 00:39:05,802
Thanks, Kylie.
Go on, you can go.

358
00:39:05,886 --> 00:39:08,513
Thanks, Oma.

359
00:39:15,771 --> 00:39:17,564
( sighs )

360
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:22,611
120 over 80.
Do you get these a lot?

361
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:23,987
Yeah, who doesn't.

362
00:39:24,071 --> 00:39:26,073
Lots of people.

363
00:39:26,156 --> 00:39:29,284
Can you just get the ibuprofen, ma'am?

364
00:39:29,368 --> 00:39:31,703
Most migraines are stress related.

365
00:39:31,787 --> 00:39:35,999
Well, it's not like we're
at war or anything.

366
00:39:36,083 --> 00:39:39,419
Do you want to stop talking?

367
00:39:39,503 --> 00:39:44,383
NO. Just get the pills. I'll be okay.

368
00:39:44,466 --> 00:39:47,010
I've been through a lot worse than this.

369
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:52,307
Here.

370
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:56,770
Ow.

371
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:05,112
( inhales, exhales )

372
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:34,808
Beautiful day in Ramadi, eh, Sergeant?

373
00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:40,480
You know what they say,
sunny outside, Sunni inside.

374
00:40:42,232 --> 00:40:45,318
I used to love Slinkies as a kid.

375
00:40:45,402 --> 00:40:46,778
And now?

376
00:40:46,862 --> 00:40:49,364
( truck passing )

377
00:40:49,448 --> 00:40:52,909
Let's check in
with the Lieutenant Colonel.

378
00:40:52,993 --> 00:40:55,120
I don't like it when ISF does security.

379
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:57,789
Marhaba.

380
00:40:57,873 --> 00:40:59,541
You think faces don't lie?

381
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:01,460
We've been here six months.

382
00:41:01,543 --> 00:41:07,132
Some guys want us dead,
others just want a job. You can tell.

383
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:09,718
What do you see when you look
at my face?

384
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:16,183
I see a Guatemalan who joined the
military to get a green card.

385
00:41:16,266 --> 00:41:18,435
God bless America.

386
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:19,978
Marhaba.

387
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:23,148
I'm telling you,
ISF are a bunch of screw-offs.

388
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:26,568
None of the higher-ups want
an Iraqi face on the situation.

389
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:29,654
They make the calls, we follow.

390
00:41:29,738 --> 00:41:32,115
Es cuéles es, eh?

391
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:33,241
What?

392
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:37,037
It is what it is.

393
00:41:40,457 --> 00:41:43,126
( indistinct chatter)

394
00:41:48,507 --> 00:41:49,841
English?

395
00:41:49,925 --> 00:41:51,051
No.

396
00:41:51,134 --> 00:41:54,513
Need a 'terp down here.
What's your name?

397
00:41:54,596 --> 00:41:57,474
Bozo, ma'am.

398
00:41:57,557 --> 00:42:01,269
It's a common Kurdish name.

399
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:07,234
Colonel Martel around?

400
00:42:07,317 --> 00:42:10,237
Just stepped out, Sergeant.

401
00:42:13,156 --> 00:42:14,658
Sully, how's it going over here?

402
00:42:14,741 --> 00:42:18,078
The processing seems to be moving forward
at the anticipated pace, Sergeant.

403
00:42:18,161 --> 00:42:23,041
Hey, Bozo, can you translate Sully for me?
I think he's speaking Swahili.

404
00:42:24,209 --> 00:42:26,378
Stay focused, gentlemen.

405
00:42:31,216 --> 00:42:34,636
Can I have a word with you, Sergeant?

406
00:42:36,012 --> 00:42:38,348
Eva and I have this agreement.

407
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:42,686
She gets something in her teeth, I
tell her, no matter how mad she gets.

408
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:44,646
She calls it "speckage."

409
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:46,189
I don't follow you.

410
00:42:46,273 --> 00:42:50,902
You're blinking like Renee Zellweger.
Here.

411
00:42:54,864 --> 00:43:00,120
You think migraines are a sign of weakness,
don't want anyone to know. I get it.

412
00:43:00,203 --> 00:43:02,914
Ibuprofen, Sergeant.
It won't kill you.

413
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:11,798
Figured that out on your own, huh?

414
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:13,925
I used to get them, too.

415
00:43:14,009 --> 00:43:15,927
What stopped it?

416
00:43:16,011 --> 00:43:18,930
You feel pain, it means you're still alive.

417
00:43:19,014 --> 00:43:23,101
Once I figured that out,
I stopped feeling pain.

418
00:43:23,184 --> 00:43:25,228
MARTEL: - Sergeant Vogel!
- Sir!

419
00:43:25,312 --> 00:43:29,733
We're losing control of this show. We need
a couple more men outside. Specialist.

420
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:30,942
Copy that, sir.

421
00:43:31,026 --> 00:43:32,777
I'll go. It's cooler here.

422
00:43:32,861 --> 00:43:33,903
Here.

423
00:43:33,987 --> 00:43:35,572
Fill up your Camelbak.

424
00:43:35,655 --> 00:43:38,033
Aguilar.

425
00:43:38,116 --> 00:43:40,619
I won't tell anyone, Sergeant.

426
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:44,748
Thank you.

427
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:55,925
( indistinct chatter, yelling )

428
00:44:23,036 --> 00:44:27,457
The face of the operation,
ladies and gentlemen!

429
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:31,127
Let's bring some U.S. Army order
to this cluster.

430
00:44:31,211 --> 00:44:33,338
( dog barks into bullhorn )

431
00:44:47,977 --> 00:44:50,230
( barking continues )

432
00:44:53,149 --> 00:44:57,362
( barking continues, echoing )

433
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:06,454
Your men do excellent work,
Sergeant.

434
00:45:06,538 --> 00:45:08,164
Sergeant.

435
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:11,668
MAN: Get down!

436
00:45:15,255 --> 00:45:19,467
( ears ringing )

437
00:45:25,598 --> 00:45:28,143
( faded crowd noise )

438
00:45:32,731 --> 00:45:34,691
( loud explosion in distance )

439
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:44,284
My guys aren't grunts,
but we can secure this goddamn mess.

440
00:45:44,367 --> 00:45:45,827
Can your guys deal with the buildings?

441
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:47,287
- Yes, sir!
- Do it then.

442
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:50,623
Alpha team, on me, Bravo team,
stack up, let's go!

443
00:45:50,707 --> 00:45:55,670
Sully, you got cover fire.
You're ATL now. Sully, go, go, go!

444
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:20,320
( loud clang )

445
00:46:24,199 --> 00:46:25,867
- High-low on my command.
- Hep.

446
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:28,369
Ready, ready, together.

447
00:46:28,453 --> 00:46:29,579
Got a closed door. Left!

448
00:46:29,662 --> 00:46:32,123
Connelly, breach!
Move it.

449
00:46:41,424 --> 00:46:42,467
Last man!

450
00:46:47,764 --> 00:46:50,809
<i>( dramatic music fades up )</i>

451
00:46:56,147 --> 00:46:58,817
( helicopter hovering )

452
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:19,754
Move up! Move up! Move up!

453
00:47:19,838 --> 00:47:22,382
Move! Move! Move!

454
00:47:23,216 --> 00:47:27,053
Get a door in front. Keep flowing.

455
00:47:27,136 --> 00:47:29,013
- Sully, take him.
- Got him.

456
00:47:29,097 --> 00:47:30,807
- Krepeau secure him!
- Roger!

457
00:47:31,975 --> 00:47:33,560
Keep flowing!

458
00:47:39,232 --> 00:47:40,275
Status!

459
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:42,193
- Alpha team, up.
- Dead Hadji to the front.

460
00:47:42,277 --> 00:47:44,112
Sully, let's clear him.

461
00:47:50,702 --> 00:47:56,207
( gasping )

462
00:47:56,291 --> 00:47:59,127
( helicopter hovering )

463
00:48:15,768 --> 00:48:19,564
( helicopter passing over )

464
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:30,450
Nice work, Sergeant.

465
00:48:30,533 --> 00:48:35,580
I'll have my guys clean this up.
You take a minute.

466
00:49:01,564 --> 00:49:04,567
One week.
Can you believe that?

467
00:49:06,486 --> 00:49:10,657
He got his citizenship papers last Tuesday.

468
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:13,493
I assumed you knew, Sergeant.

469
00:49:17,038 --> 00:49:19,499
At least he died an American.

470
00:49:31,761 --> 00:49:33,888
( spits )

471
00:49:44,065 --> 00:49:47,402
<i>( somber music )</i>

472
00:50:13,469 --> 00:50:16,222
<i>( somber music continues )</i>

473
00:50:18,141 --> 00:50:20,435
You need to drop your pack
once in a while.

474
00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:21,728
You know that, right?

475
00:50:21,811 --> 00:50:23,021
Right.

476
00:50:23,104 --> 00:50:24,939
Be a good leader,
just not all the time.

477
00:50:25,023 --> 00:50:28,526
That's not what I meant
and you know it.

478
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:30,945
My orders were clear, ma'am.

479
00:50:31,029 --> 00:50:34,991
One bad decision and somebody dies.

480
00:50:42,123 --> 00:50:44,333
That's reality.

481
00:50:50,131 --> 00:50:54,218
Sometimes the worst decision
is not trusting anyone.

482
00:50:54,302 --> 00:50:58,181
What's that supposed to mean?

483
00:50:58,264 --> 00:51:00,892
You and Bud are good at stowing things.

484
00:51:00,975 --> 00:51:04,437
I am not my grandfather, ma'am.

485
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:07,356
So when you get back home, you're gonna
open the war chest for your son?

486
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:10,234
How do you know I have a son?

487
00:51:10,318 --> 00:51:15,573
Well, you're not collecting things
just for yourself.

488
00:51:15,656 --> 00:51:17,492
What's his name?

489
00:51:18,868 --> 00:51:22,705
How do you deal with the ones
who die on your watch, ma'am?

490
00:51:26,793 --> 00:51:29,003
Not very well.

491
00:51:33,174 --> 00:51:38,638
His name is Zachary, "Z Man."

492
00:51:38,721 --> 00:51:44,018
He's five,
gonna be a future center fielder.

493
00:51:44,102 --> 00:51:46,312
Like Kirby Puckett?

494
00:51:46,395 --> 00:51:49,190
Like his old man.

495
00:51:49,273 --> 00:51:54,278
So, why do you think your
grandfather chose you?

496
00:51:54,362 --> 00:51:56,739
Well, I found the footlocker, ma'am.

497
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:03,913
VOGEL:
I think he knew that I'd "get it."

498
00:52:07,792 --> 00:52:09,585
We can stop if you want.

499
00:52:09,669 --> 00:52:14,340
Nope, a deal is a deal.

500
00:52:14,423 --> 00:52:17,510
But, you're not having any fun.

501
00:52:17,593 --> 00:52:20,096
( chuckles )

502
00:52:20,179 --> 00:52:23,182
Oh, I've been far worse than this, Kylie.

503
00:52:23,266 --> 00:52:27,186
I think I can handle telling a few stories.

504
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:30,940
Besides, is the enemy still spying on us?

505
00:52:33,776 --> 00:52:36,779
Go ahead.
Pick a good one.

506
00:52:36,863 --> 00:52:38,364
Okay.

507
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:17,445
Was he your friend?

508
00:53:25,203 --> 00:53:28,080
Yup.

509
00:53:28,164 --> 00:53:32,168
Jack O'Hara.

510
00:53:32,251 --> 00:53:37,506
This was taken at Camp Mackall,
before we shipped off to England.

511
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:42,428
You can tell neither
of those faces has ever seen combat.

512
00:53:47,892 --> 00:53:49,894
Let's just say this one didn't count.

513
00:53:49,977 --> 00:53:51,896
Go ahead, pick another one.

514
00:53:56,734 --> 00:53:58,694
Tell me about him.

515
00:54:00,738 --> 00:54:04,575
Grab that knife there,
now that's a hell of a story.

516
00:54:04,659 --> 00:54:08,371
No, he was your platoon sergeant.

517
00:54:10,039 --> 00:54:11,374
Right?

518
00:54:13,542 --> 00:54:15,962
What happened to him?

519
00:54:21,008 --> 00:54:22,260
( sighs )

520
00:54:22,343 --> 00:54:24,220
How'd he die?

521
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:37,566
Yep.

522
00:54:45,866 --> 00:54:47,618
<i>( somber music )</i>

<i>Yours respectfully,
Lieutenant Richard C. Vogel.</i>

534

535

Amen.

539
00:57:19,353 --> 00:57:22,481
Isn't this a glorious site, sir?

540
00:57:22,565 --> 00:57:27,153
They'll see the same thing
back home in a few hours if it's clear.

541
00:57:30,948 --> 00:57:34,285
You German guys need to lighten up,
you know that?

542
00:57:34,368 --> 00:57:35,911
Victor Borge is German.

543
00:57:35,995 --> 00:57:39,790
He's Danish and you know it.

544
00:57:43,127 --> 00:57:48,632
There were two Catholic churches in
my neighborhood.

545
00:57:48,716 --> 00:57:54,597
The German one was closer by six blocks,
but we went to St. Malachy, the Irish one.

546
00:57:56,807 --> 00:58:01,020
One day my old man tells me to go
to Confession.

547
00:58:01,103 --> 00:58:04,565
So, I sneak into the German church,

548
00:58:04,648 --> 00:58:07,610
and the minute I say, "Bless me,
Father, for I have sinned,"

549
00:58:07,693 --> 00:58:11,780
the priest, who can't even see me,
says through the screen,

550
00:58:11,864 --> 00:58:16,911
"You don't belong to this church,
do you?" "No," I say.

551
00:58:16,994 --> 00:58:22,583
I mean, I'm not gonna lie, I'm in Confession.
And you know what he says to me?

552
00:58:22,666 --> 00:58:25,544
Keep walking.

553
00:58:25,628 --> 00:58:29,507
( laughs )

554
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:35,137
I should have left the church right
then and there.

555
00:58:35,221 --> 00:58:37,973
But I didn't.

556
00:58:38,057 --> 00:58:40,809
And you know why?

557
00:58:40,893 --> 00:58:46,857
Because I'm loyal.
I am loyal as a goddamn dog.

558
00:58:49,944 --> 00:58:51,946
You're in high spirits tonight,
Sergeant.

559
00:58:52,029 --> 00:58:56,867
Spring is here, the Lord is risen,

560
00:58:56,951 --> 00:58:59,620
and we're over the Rhine.

561
00:58:59,703 --> 00:59:02,831
What's not to love?

562
00:59:02,915 --> 00:59:05,834
There's victory in the air,

563
00:59:05,918 --> 00:59:10,673
and it smells
an awful lot like Irene's perfume.

564
00:59:13,133 --> 00:59:15,135
You know what I smell?

565
00:59:15,219 --> 00:59:20,975
Same thing I've smelled since Normandy:
diesel, cordite and death.

566
00:59:24,311 --> 00:59:28,399
It's a long way to Berlin, Sergeant.

567

569

Donnelly! Donnelly, stuff that
smile where the sun can't find it!

570
00:59:59,763 --> 01:00:03,475
Brandt, dig that hole until you hit Peking!

571
01:00:03,559 --> 01:00:06,478
Is something funny, Califano?

572
01:00:06,562 --> 01:00:10,024
Come on, Sarge, Hitler's army is down
to ankle biters and cane jockeys.

573
01:00:10,107 --> 01:00:11,567
Everybody knows that.

574
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:13,319
I just saw into the future.

575
01:00:13,402 --> 01:00:15,863
You know who the last Yank was to die
before the Krauts surrendered?

576
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:20,284
Some Mussolini WOP bastard
from Long Island.

577
01:00:22,286 --> 01:00:24,079
Listen up.

578
01:00:24,163 --> 01:00:29,585
I know you boys feel like we got
this thing wrapped up.

579
01:00:29,668 --> 01:00:33,672
Thanks to you,
the Krauts are on their heels.

580
01:00:33,756 --> 01:00:38,469
Our orders are to hold this position.
Our expectation is for a counteroffensive.

581
01:00:38,552 --> 01:00:41,347
Full battalion, werewolf
operation, who knows?

582
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:45,225
Whatever they send, we will be ready.
We will defeat them.

583
01:00:45,309 --> 01:00:47,102
And you men will stay sharp!

584
01:00:47,186 --> 01:00:51,023
Because I'll be damned if I'm going to write
one more letter like this one. Are we clear?

585
01:00:51,106 --> 01:00:52,149
Yes, sir.

586
01:00:52,232 --> 01:00:53,275
Let's get to work.

587
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:55,736
Are we expecting armor, sir?

588
01:00:55,819 --> 01:00:59,114
From the east, they're moving fast.
Corporal, get us some air power.

589
01:00:59,198 --> 01:01:02,868
We're gonna hit their flanks fast. I'll
take the north. You take the south.

590
01:01:02,951 --> 01:01:05,579
Let them drive through,
we'll pin them against the river.

591
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:06,705
All right? Meet me at the church.

592
01:01:06,789 --> 01:01:08,374
Yes, sir.

593
01:01:08,457 --> 01:01:11,001
Sergeant? I'll be there.

594
01:01:11,085 --> 01:01:12,127

676
01:13:26,486 --> 01:13:32,450

together on this great holiday.

Now, Ruthy, you go next.

I had fried chicken and baked beans.

Lieutenant Tripp,

vegetable on the planet.

Corn is a grain.

It is not.

01:15:21,726 --> 01:15:24,938
I tell you the most important story
of my entire life,

703
01:15:25,021 --> 01:15:27,815
and you argue
with me about corn?

704
01:15:29,484 --> 01:15:34,906
So, um... how did you say goodbye
to your grandfather?

705
01:15:36,241 --> 01:15:39,035
I told you, he's still alive.

706
01:15:39,118 --> 01:15:41,162
I mean that night.

707
01:15:52,382 --> 01:15:54,551
You're not thinking of stealing
that, are you?

708
01:16:15,530 --> 01:16:17,240
Uh-uh.

709
01:16:17,323 --> 01:16:18,700
Open it.

710
01:16:20,201 --> 01:16:22,287
Okay, take those.

711
01:16:24,581 --> 01:16:26,165
There you go.

712
01:16:47,437 --> 01:16:49,105
( crickets chirping )

713
01:17:32,815 --> 01:17:34,734
Ow.

714
01:17:48,247 --> 01:17:50,667
Jeez.

715
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:09,352
<i>( somber music )</i>

716
01:18:44,053 --> 01:18:46,389
- Uh, Ruthy?
- Yeah?

717
01:18:46,472 --> 01:18:49,684
- Have you got any queens?
- Go fish.

718
01:18:49,767 --> 01:18:51,686
You've got one right there, idiot.

719
01:18:51,769 --> 01:18:54,731
No fair!

720
01:18:54,814 --> 01:18:56,691
Here, give me the queen.

721
01:19:03,239 --> 01:19:06,033
Vogel.

722
01:19:06,117 --> 01:19:08,077
Pardon?

723
01:19:08,161 --> 01:19:12,874
Vogel bedeutet bird auf Deutsch.

724
01:19:12,957 --> 01:19:18,796
Vogel means "bird" in German.
Bet you didn't know that.

725
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:23,926
No. Is that why you like them
so much?

726
01:19:24,010 --> 01:19:26,179
I expect.

727
01:19:26,262 --> 01:19:31,058
So, what's so special about the
meadowlark?

728
01:19:31,142 --> 01:19:33,561
The eastern meadowlark?

729
01:19:35,062 --> 01:19:39,984
Sweetest song ever composed for the
human ear. Ever hear one?

730
01:19:42,528 --> 01:19:47,533
Well, they all left,
along with the prairie.

731
01:19:47,617 --> 01:19:49,577
( steps approaching )

732
01:19:53,623 --> 01:19:54,707
Hey, Dad.

733
01:19:58,503 --> 01:20:00,755
- Hi, Dad.
- Where is the rest of the crew?

734
01:20:00,838 --> 01:20:02,548
Fishing.

735
01:20:02,632 --> 01:20:04,592
At night?

736
01:20:04,675 --> 01:20:08,012
RUTH: Go fish!

737
01:20:08,095 --> 01:20:10,264
So, guess what happened today?
I found Opa's foot lock...

738
01:20:10,348 --> 01:20:11,474
I got you something.

739
01:20:16,687 --> 01:20:18,397
It's too big for him.

740
01:20:18,481 --> 01:20:21,692
He'll grow into it.
Right, buddy?

741
01:20:21,776 --> 01:20:23,402
Yeah.

742
01:20:25,154 --> 01:20:28,115
Daddy!

743
01:20:28,199 --> 01:20:30,159
Hi, Ronnie.

744
01:20:31,828 --> 01:20:34,163
All right, guys.
What do you say?

745
01:20:34,247 --> 01:20:37,625
Thank you.

746
01:20:47,009 --> 01:20:48,052
Kylie.

747
01:20:48,135 --> 01:20:50,096
Yeah?

748
01:20:54,141 --> 01:20:58,437
It was a privilege spending
the afternoon with you.

749
01:21:18,249 --> 01:21:20,459
Thanks, Kylie.

750
01:21:20,543 --> 01:21:22,378
Thanks, Oma.

751
01:21:26,799 --> 01:21:29,093
You boys have a good chat?

752
01:21:29,176 --> 01:21:32,179
You tell me. You overheard
the whole damn thing.

753
01:21:32,263 --> 01:21:36,058
Oh, no fair.

754
01:21:47,612 --> 01:21:49,906
Kyle, let's go.

755
01:21:51,949 --> 01:21:53,910
Did he carry them all the time?

756
01:21:53,993 --> 01:21:55,912
Until that night, ma'am.

757
01:21:55,995 --> 01:21:58,122
Well?

758
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:11,469
Do they work?

759
01:22:12,887 --> 01:22:14,513
I'm still here.

760
01:22:24,815 --> 01:22:27,151
You should get some sleep.

761
01:22:27,234 --> 01:22:29,612
No fair!

762
01:22:37,495 --> 01:22:40,247
You said your grampa knew you'd get it.

763
01:22:40,331 --> 01:22:42,166
Yes, ma'am.

764
01:22:43,876 --> 01:22:45,086
Do you?

765
01:22:51,676 --> 01:22:54,303
Good night, Lieutenant.

766
01:22:55,596 --> 01:22:57,556
Good night.

767
01:23:05,398 --> 01:23:08,192
( sighs )

768
01:23:08,275 --> 01:23:12,530
<i>( somber music )</i>

769
01:23:17,952 --> 01:23:20,871
Just a minute, Sergeant.

770
01:23:20,955 --> 01:23:23,874
And here I thought my interrogation
was over, ma'am.

771
01:23:23,958 --> 01:23:26,210
I never caught your wife's name.

772
01:23:26,293 --> 01:23:27,503
If you're jealous, I...

773
01:23:27,586 --> 01:23:30,131
Nah, I just want to know who
to feel sorry for.

774
01:23:32,383 --> 01:23:34,635
I'm going to miss you,
Lieutenant Tripp.

775
01:23:34,719 --> 01:23:39,473
I hope we never see each other again,
and I mean that in the best way.

776
01:23:42,268 --> 01:23:44,729
Center field, huh?

777
01:23:44,812 --> 01:23:47,023
It's for your first burger when you
get back home.

778
01:23:47,106 --> 01:23:50,985
Maybe after one
of Z Man's little league games.

779
01:23:51,068 --> 01:23:53,237
Thank you, ma'am.

780
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:55,239
( helicopter approaching )

781
01:23:55,322 --> 01:23:57,616
Sounds like your bird is here.

782
01:24:02,663 --> 01:24:04,915
Her name is Sarah, by the way.

783
01:24:06,333 --> 01:24:09,086
"It is what it is," right?

784
01:24:14,633 --> 01:24:18,512
( helicopter hovering )

785
01:24:22,141 --> 01:24:25,770
<i>( soft music )</i>

786
01:24:43,370 --> 01:24:49,168
BUD: You know, some people say we're
different from other animals.

787
01:24:49,251 --> 01:24:53,464
Because we can do one thing they can't.

788
01:24:53,547 --> 01:24:55,925
Kill at a distance.

789
01:25:13,234 --> 01:25:15,903
Well, well, if it ain't the Collector.

790
01:25:15,986 --> 01:25:17,029
Gentlemen.

791
01:25:17,113 --> 01:25:19,115
- Salutations, Staff Sergeant.
- Boo-boo all healed?

792
01:25:19,198 --> 01:25:20,491
CAPTAIN LARSON: - Sergeant Vogel?
- Sir.

793
01:25:20,574 --> 01:25:21,700
Glad to see you're all settled in.

794
01:25:21,784 --> 01:25:23,619
Your platoon leaders are in the
briefing room.

795
01:25:26,705 --> 01:25:28,666
Welcome back to the war.

796
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:37,675
Gentlemen, meet Mahmoud Abu-Hassan.

797
01:25:37,758 --> 01:25:40,219
Number four on the HV I list for MNF West.

798
01:25:40,302 --> 01:25:43,681
He's the top man running the
IED cell down the Euphrates river,

799
01:25:43,764 --> 01:25:47,977
and every IED from here to Fallujah
reeks of his scum.

800
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:52,106
RCT wants him detained.
I'll take him DOA.

801
01:25:52,189 --> 01:25:57,361
Intel from a villager near Rawah says
he's in the house on this corner.

802
01:25:57,444 --> 01:26:00,239
Likely escape route is
towards the river, here.

803
01:26:00,322 --> 01:26:04,660
Gentlemen, the <i>2</i> shop has put together
targeting packages.

804
01:26:04,743 --> 01:26:10,082
1st Platoon, your task and purpose is
to prevent Al Qaeda and Iraq personnel

805
01:26:10,166 --> 01:26:12,251
from leaving the target area.

806
01:26:12,334 --> 01:26:15,421
2nd Platoon, your task and purpose:

807
01:26:15,504 --> 01:26:19,508
seize HVT in target area to allow
HET exploitation

808
01:26:19,592 --> 01:26:26,515
and gather further intel on IED cell operating in AO.
3rd Platoon, block enemy forces

809
01:26:26,599 --> 01:26:28,017
from entering the target area.

810
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:31,353
1st Platoon Delta Company, provide
company reserve

811
01:26:31,437 --> 01:26:33,647
and maneuver support to the 1st Platoon.

812
01:26:33,731 --> 01:26:37,151
Now once we get this guy, the HET-Team
guys will get the intel

813
01:26:37,234 --> 01:26:39,028
and we'll take down his network.

814
01:26:39,111 --> 01:26:41,071
I want a back brief on your mission
in 15 minutes.

815
01:26:41,155 --> 01:26:45,910
Key leader rehearsal in two hours
No change in service and support.

816
01:26:45,993 --> 01:26:50,915
Have your platoon sergeant see the 1st
sergeant for any resource shortages.

817
01:26:50,998 --> 01:26:54,168
Gentlemen, we don't get this HVT,

818
01:26:54,251 --> 01:26:57,671
there's another sheep carcass
in someone's future.

819
01:26:57,755 --> 01:27:00,424
Next guy may not be so lucky.

820
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:06,055
Questions?

821
01:27:06,138 --> 01:27:08,390
Okay. Let's go to work.

822
01:27:18,692 --> 01:27:19,818
And?

823
01:27:19,902 --> 01:27:21,737
We're establishing a dismounted
blocking position

824
01:27:21,820 --> 01:27:24,615
near the river up in Rawah.
Company's doing HVT snatch.

825
01:27:24,698 --> 01:27:27,743
- When do we have to be in position?
- 0-5.

826
01:27:27,826 --> 01:27:30,246

We miss the guy, the next wave of Joes
take an IED up the ass.

01:29:59,603 --> 01:30:01,730
I don't follow you.

850
01:30:01,814 --> 01:30:04,149
It's a Beretta.

851
01:30:04,233 --> 01:30:06,443
Just wear it like an issue
weapon through custom check.

852
01:30:09,863 --> 01:30:13,617
Crown jewel of The Collection.

853
01:30:13,700 --> 01:30:16,829

Hey, how do you think the

863
01:32:31,755 --> 01:32:35,008
Hmm? Oh

864
01:32:35,092 --> 01:32:38,887
Santana's not doing too bad, but the Sox
are off to a hell of a good start, so...

865
01:32:42,182 --> 01:32:45,435
I would have done the same thing.

866
01:32:45,519 --> 01:32:46,645
About what?

867
01:32:46,728 --> 01:32:51,858
That muj? Probably shitting out intel

Got a minute?

872

It is what it is, yo.

873
01:33:16,675 --> 01:33:20,095
Sir, if this is about the blocking
position, I stand behind my decision

874
01:33:20,178 --> 01:33:22,264
and I accept full responsibility
for all of my actions...

875
01:33:22,347 --> 01:33:24,057
It's not that.

876
01:33:28,687 --> 01:33:33,859
I held this back an extra day,
and I stand by that decision as well.

877
01:33:52,961 --> 01:33:56,214
I'm sorry, Vogel.

878
01:33:56,298 --> 01:34:02,179
We got a Red Cross message

Yes, sir.
