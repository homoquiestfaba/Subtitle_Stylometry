1
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:15,299
Mr. Robert, are you ready?

2
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,419
You packed already?

3
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:20,420
Sheriff is kicking you out tomorrow.

4
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,419
He arrived.

5
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,539
I am so glad.

6
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:23,540
Go ahead, sit in the car.

7
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:48,580
Check.

8
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:34,460
Transition, my ass.

9
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:44,780
Mirko, please.

10
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,259
Mirko, please.

11
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:04,260
What?!

12
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,620
It's green.

13
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:26,060
What you looking at?

14
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,780
Motherfucker.

15
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,859
Mirko, please.

16
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:40,860
Oh, that's Ivana. How are you Ivana?

17
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,179
Hi, how are you, Tosha?

18
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,539
Not so bad.

19
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:13,540
Goodbye.

20
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,700
Hello Olga.

21
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:19,060
This is Robert, Branko's friend
from New York.

22
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:35,260
No thanks, I am in a hurry.

23
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,979
And I think he is tired.

24
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:41,980
I'll talk to you later.

25
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:30,380
What is this?

26
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:40,020
Where the fuck is it?

27
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:09,980
Motherfucker.

28
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:57,259
Inventory.

29
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:00,260
Inventory, can't you read?

30
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:24,100
C'mon.

31
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:35,260
Stanka, this is my
friend from New York.

32
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:55,660
Thank you.

33
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:01,140
What the hell...

34
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,900
C'mon motherfucker.

35
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:07,419
It's your turn now.

36
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:10,420
Do you feel like song?

37
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:34,100
You're so beautiful today.

38
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:39,580
We'll throw this away...

39
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:03,219
C'mon Mister, buy the roses.

40
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:06,220
C'mon, Mister, for your wife.

41
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,819
C'mon Mister.

42
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:13,820
Three hundred.

43
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:17,100
Hundred more.

44
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,619
Why the fuck are you
begging him?

45
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:09,620
Mirko, shut up, please.

46
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:19,299
You are begging him
to go to America?!

47
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:22,300
Mirko, shut up already!

48
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:28,219
I could have gone to
America any time,

49
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:29,659
but I didn't want to!

50
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:32,660
I can see from here how
fucked up they are.

51
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:36,860
Wait, I mean, everybody
knows that...

52
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:49,180
Motherfuckers!

53
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:44,500
Wine for young lady,

54
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:47,860
and a beer for a gentleman.

55
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:55,700
Here, if you don't mind.

56
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:45,140
Enough with these politics!

57
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:43,859
Come on, you motherfucker!

58
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:46,860
You grease ball, I'll fuck
you up real good!

59
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:29,820
Good morning.

60
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:41,300
Two, please.

61
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:33,620
Ivana, come in.
What's wrong?

62
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:37,220
Why are you crying?
What happened?

63
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:41,460
Robert what?

64
00:58:41,580 --> 00:58:44,580
What happened?

65
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:56,779
What happened?
- All I know is that he's arrested.

66
00:58:56,780 --> 00:58:58,539
Who's arrested?
- Branko.

67
00:58:58,540 --> 00:59:00,699
What are you talking about?
What happened?

68
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:03,700
Why is he arrested?
- Because of him.

69
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:51,660
Sure... no problem.

70
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:35,340
...shit.

71
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:38,980
How do you say it...?

72
01:01:49,020 --> 01:01:52,020
Right, that oughta do it...

73
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:19,740
Thank you so much.

74
01:06:20,420 --> 01:06:23,420
We'll pay you back from New York.

75
01:06:31,580 --> 01:06:34,580
Let's go, we are late.

76
01:07:56,700 --> 01:07:59,259
My best man!

77
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:02,260
C'mon, play something!

78
01:08:15,940 --> 01:08:18,940
Congratulations,
I wish you all the best!

79
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:21,899
Thank you.

80
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:24,659
Sorry, I've gotta go.
- Where are you going?

81
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:27,299
I've gotta rush to the
American embassy.

82
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:28,659
What about the wedding?

83
01:08:28,660 --> 01:08:30,459
You can celebrate...

84
01:08:30,460 --> 01:08:32,019
What about the groom?

85
01:08:32,020 --> 01:08:35,020
Goodbye.

86
01:08:39,340 --> 01:08:42,340
Hey best man, give us
some money!

87
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:29,500
My love.

88
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:21,500
See you.

89
01:13:59,660 --> 01:14:02,660
Close your eyes now.

90
01:14:05,820 --> 01:14:08,820
Not yet, not yet.

91
01:14:12,940 --> 01:14:15,940
Now.

92
01:14:29,580 --> 01:14:32,580
Unbelievable.
