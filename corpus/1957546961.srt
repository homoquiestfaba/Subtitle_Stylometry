1
00:01:31,617 --> 00:01:33,698
Hey, babe. Finally.

2
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:34,459
Hi.

3
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,018
Nice to see you.

4
00:01:36,038 --> 00:01:37,138
Congrats on the show.

5
00:01:37,158 --> 00:01:38,338
You look beautiful.

6
00:01:40,756 --> 00:01:41,478
Thanks guys.

7
00:01:41,498 --> 00:01:42,439
You did so good.

8
00:01:42,459 --> 00:01:44,978
The show is amazing, congratulations.

9
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:48,441
Gentlemen, not bad.

10
00:01:49,341 --> 00:01:49,863
One, two, three.

11
00:01:49,883 --> 00:01:55,149
Yeah it's like

12
00:01:55,169 --> 00:01:59,430
a fixture.

13
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:00,061
She's everywhere.

14
00:02:00,081 --> 00:02:02,345
She's like the opening of an envelope.

15
00:02:02,365 --> 00:02:04,198
I don't mind

16
00:02:04,218 --> 00:02:05,890
coming here at night.

17
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,360
I'm kind of enjoying it in a way.

18
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,768
It's winter and Yours.

19
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:18,930
Speaker 1:

20
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:20,340
Sorry.

21
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,780
So how are you two love birds?

22
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,090
Distressed huh?

23
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:24,971
Yeah. You should feel good.

24
00:02:24,991 --> 00:02:25,980
Tonight was awesome.

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,798
It was really good.

26
00:02:26,818 --> 00:02:27,643
Really.

27
00:02:27,663 --> 00:02:29,890
It's exceptional.

28
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:30,650
That's what I'm just telling

29
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:31,515
It's better than I planned.

30
00:02:31,535 --> 00:02:32,050
Charlotte:

31
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,070
Really?

32
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,088
I had high expectation,

33
00:02:35,108 --> 00:02:36,632
Yeah.

34
00:02:36,652 --> 00:02:38,528
My gallery delivers, but

35
00:02:38,548 --> 00:02:43,366
tonight was beautiful and
the work speaks for itself. So,

36
00:02:43,386 --> 00:02:43,750
You're

37
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,084
in your head.

38
00:02:45,104 --> 00:02:46,290
Nothing. Nothing.

39
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,310
It's hard to take.

40
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,650
Compliments, but thank you.

41
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,320
Okay, so we'll stop.

42
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,747
No, don't.

43
00:02:55,767 --> 00:02:57,856
Speaker 1:

44
00:02:57,876 --> 00:02:59,960
Well, here we are.

45
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,730
After years of pestering
me, I finally had to give in and

46
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,500
let Charlotte have her own solo show.

47
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:12,510
Mostly because I think she
would have left us if I didn't, but in

48
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:16,850
all seriousness Charlotte, you
are so talented and beautiful

49
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:21,026
and so lucky to have all these
amazing friends in your life.

50
00:03:21,046 --> 00:03:23,070
Congratulations.

51
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:23,892
Cheers.

52
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,935
Congratulations.

53
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:27,910
Yay.

54
00:04:50,601 --> 00:04:58,601
Speaker 4:

55
00:05:01,861 --> 00:05:03,021
Charlotte. Charlotte wait.

56
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:04,041
Charlotte.

57
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:24,670
Charlotte, hey it's this is JG.

58
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,560
Listen, I been trying to reach you,

59
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,100
but you're not picking up my calls.

60
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,071
So I don't know how else to do this.

61
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:45,713
Your mom she passed away last night.

62
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:55,230
Sorry to be the one that had to tell you.

63
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:59,972
It was just, no one could
really get a hold of you.

64
00:06:59,992 --> 00:07:06,881
Please give me a call back if you want.

65
00:07:11,296 --> 00:07:19,296
I'm sorry. >>

66
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:35,290
So how long are you gonna be around for?

67
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,340
Until Monday I think.

68
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,717
You'll probably have to hit some of

69
00:08:42,737 --> 00:08:47,116
the old stomping grounds before you take off.

70
00:08:47,136 --> 00:08:48,202
Yeah.

71
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:56,290
Listen I'm sorry about the voice mail.

72
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:59,670
Just tough getting a hold of you sometimes.

73
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:01,000
I know.

74
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:01,641
It's okay.

75
00:09:01,661 --> 00:09:04,690
Probably should have done a
better job at keeping in touch.

76
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,890
It's my fault.

77
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,370
So do you know the plan for

78
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:12,100
the funeral or anything?

79
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:17,260
I think it's already been taken care of.

80
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,790
She left instructions.

81
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:21,170
She really didn't want a
funeral or anything like that.

82
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:24,440
So, think it's just gonna
be like a party kind of thing.

83
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,680
Yeah, yeah that's right.

84
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,781
I heard that.

85
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:29,800
From who?

86
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,510
Just around.

87
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,920
You know how it is here.

88
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:42,940
Yeah. >>

89
00:09:43,987 --> 00:09:47,290
I have to pick up the ashes tomorrow.

90
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:48,023
Well,

91
00:09:48,043 --> 00:09:53,517
let me know if you want me
to come with you or anything.

92
00:09:53,537 --> 00:09:54,233
Thanks.

93
00:09:54,253 --> 00:09:56,395
Yeah, of course.

94
00:12:15,052 --> 00:12:18,049
Hello, hello, hello.

95
00:12:18,069 --> 00:12:19,929
The champagne is flowing.

96
00:12:19,949 --> 00:12:20,886
I love it when Chloe starts popping

97
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:21,481
champagne bottles.

98
00:12:21,501 --> 00:12:24,290
Do you want to open up a bottle of champagne?

99
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,340
I wish I wasn't.

100
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,500
Hey Chloe, remember being wasted at

101
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,610
Kim's wedding?

102
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,290
You were wasted? When?

103
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,350
Wasted.

104
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:34,870
Please, go inside.

105
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:37,236
I gotta go home.

106
00:15:03,011 --> 00:15:08,143
So for now, I'll take my time.

107
00:15:08,163 --> 00:15:13,502
For now, I can't

108
00:15:13,522 --> 00:15:17,794
be bothered.

109
00:15:17,814 --> 00:15:22,717
But I learned, a lot of things.

110
00:15:22,737 --> 00:15:29,375
I fudged a lot

111
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:36,035
of numbers.

112
00:15:36,055 --> 00:15:41,257
Half of my life I've

113
00:15:41,277 --> 00:15:45,562
been watching.

114
00:15:45,582 --> 00:15:53,582
Half of my life I've been waking up.

115
00:15:53,723 --> 00:16:01,522
Birds in the sky could warn me.

116
00:16:01,542 --> 00:16:05,302
Miss

117
00:17:17,407 --> 00:17:18,388
Hey.

118
00:17:18,408 --> 00:17:19,269
Hey.

119
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:20,967
How you holding up?

120
00:17:20,987 --> 00:17:23,467
I'm okay.

121
00:17:23,487 --> 00:17:26,847
It's funny you know.

122
00:17:26,867 --> 00:17:31,350
The last time we spoke
she said don't let those

123
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:36,212
other people get to you,
or something like that.

124
00:17:36,232 --> 00:17:40,148
And I didn't tell her I was upset, or

125
00:17:40,168 --> 00:17:43,451
that anyone was bothering me.

126
00:17:43,471 --> 00:17:44,246
She just knew.

127
00:17:44,266 --> 00:17:47,104
Like,

128
00:17:47,124 --> 00:17:49,191
they always just know when we're hurting.

129
00:17:54,903 --> 00:17:56,576
Do you want to step outside for

130
00:17:56,596 --> 00:17:58,683
a minute, maybe get some fresh air?

131
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:02,663
Yeah, just give me a sec.

132
00:18:02,683 --> 00:18:03,224
Yeah.

133
00:18:03,244 --> 00:18:05,204
I'm going to go grab my coat.

134
00:18:09,803 --> 00:18:13,784
Speaker 8:

135
00:19:56,701 --> 00:19:57,362
What was that all about?

136
00:19:57,382 --> 00:19:59,341
I'm sorry.

137
00:19:59,361 --> 00:20:02,141
I just had to get out of there.

138
00:20:02,161 --> 00:20:03,581
I don't know.

139
00:21:12,381 --> 00:21:13,381
What are you doing?

140
00:21:18,155 --> 00:21:19,636
Getting dressed.

141
00:21:19,656 --> 00:21:23,615
I got to go home.

142
00:21:23,635 --> 00:21:28,990
Give me a ride to

143
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:33,955
the station?

144
00:21:33,975 --> 00:21:36,195
Yeah, sure.

145
00:22:16,481 --> 00:22:18,021
You can still come with me, you know.

146
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:21,801
Yeah, maybe.

147
00:22:30,234 --> 00:22:31,234
I love you.

148
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:36,554
I know.

149
00:22:55,699 --> 00:23:02,319
Wait!
