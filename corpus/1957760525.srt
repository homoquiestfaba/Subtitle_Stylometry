[horse hooves galloping]

3
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:01,335
Enough
of the chicken shit, Sheriff.

4
00:05:01,369 --> 00:05:03,337
Know as well I do,

5
00:05:03,371 --> 00:05:04,705
you can't make us leave.

6
00:05:04,738 --> 00:05:06,607
Alive, anyways, Sheriff.

7
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,475
[laughter]

8
00:05:09,477 --> 00:05:12,346
Well, we don't want
any trouble here, Left Eye,

9
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,748
so just tell us what it is
you all want.

10
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:17,117
What we want is simple.

11
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,052
We hear your town possesses
a lot of,

12
00:05:19,086 --> 00:05:20,788
what should I say, boys, uh.

13
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:23,123
A lot of natural materials.

14
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,291
That's right.

15
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,460
Underground.

16
00:05:26,494 --> 00:05:28,429
Natural material?

17
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:30,598
Underground?

18
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:33,501
Jesus, you fellas must be
talkin' about
that cow dung problem.

19
00:05:38,506 --> 00:05:39,807
That's not funny.

20
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,111
Okay.

21
00:05:46,614 --> 00:05:48,248
It's all a rumor.

22
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:49,316
Okay, Left Eye,
it's all a rumor.

23
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,119
There is no gold in Flatridge.

24
00:05:57,124 --> 00:05:58,526
I'll be the judge of that.

25
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,328
Listen,

26
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,831
see, I wanna play sheriff
for a couple of days.

27
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:06,099
My boys here,
they wanna be deputies.

28
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:08,168
That way, can't break the law,

29
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,336
'cause we'll be the law.

30
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,672
[laughter]

31
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:14,442
We also hear your town
possesses something else,
Sheriff.

32
00:06:14,475 --> 00:06:15,676
Yes.

33
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:19,046
Hottest commodity
east of the Mexican border.

34
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,184
Women.

[screaming]

36
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:33,193
Don't knock it 'til you try it,
baby.

What is it, Jake?

45
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,286
Left Eye and his
band of outlaws

46
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,288
have taken over
Flatridge County.

47
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,591
Lookin' for gold.

48
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:12,560
They, uh,

49
00:08:12,593 --> 00:08:15,428
they killed a couple
of the woman who refused
to bed with them.

50
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:19,733
Your sister was one of 'em.

51
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,737
I'm sorry.

52
00:08:45,626 --> 00:08:48,796
She didn't go without putting
up a fight, though, Rachel.

53
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:50,664
She cut one of 'em.

54
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,300
Right underneath the eye.

55
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:10,684
Thank you, Jake.

56
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,661
I'll take care of her now.

00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,898

00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:40,648
"Let mine enemy
be as the wicked.

59

And he that rises up
against me, feel my wrath.

60
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:50,824
And the just
will have his day."

61
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,532
Oh.

62
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:07,941
I promised myself I would never
return to a life of guns.

63
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:15,415
God as my witness, Sally,

64
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,585
I'm gonna find the man
that did this to you.

65
00:10:20,721 --> 00:10:24,357
I'm gonna find him
and I'm gonna make him pay.

66
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:26,626
I'm gonna make them pay.

67

68
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:37,637
Oh, God.

70

72

Ha ha.

73
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:10,463
Yes, yes, yes.

74
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,935
Sorry, sweet cakes.

75
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:16,536
It was real,

76
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,639
but all good things have got
to come to an end.

77
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:24,111
Ooh.

78
00:12:24,144 --> 00:12:27,848
My, my, my,
you're full of surprises.

79
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:36,223
Leaving so soon, Johnny?

80
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,559
Don't make me split your wig.

81
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,661
I take it you lie when you said

82
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:44,231
it wasn't all about the sex,
Johnny.

83
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:47,835
Technically, no,
it was about the sex...

84
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:50,070
...and the loot.

85
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,574
And Chastity, don't try nothin'.

86
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,776
I got backup.

87
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,549
You know Lou.

88
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:04,818
See you 'round.

89
00:13:04,852 --> 00:13:08,721
My mamma said
there'd be days like this.

[gunshots]

91
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:32,079
Oh, by the way,
I was fakin' it.

92
00:13:41,088 --> 00:13:43,190
We hear she's fast
with a knife.

93
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:45,993
No woman with a knife's
faster than me.

94
00:13:47,594 --> 00:13:48,828
Hey!

95
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:50,763
Hey!

96
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:59,907
I hear you're fast
with a knife.

97
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,942
How fast are you?

98
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:06,679
Hey!

99
00:14:07,614 --> 00:14:09,182
I'm talkin' to you!

100
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,288
Quick enough.

101
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:41,781
Call it.

102
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:43,650
One,

103
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:45,318
two,

104
00:14:45,352 --> 00:14:46,653
draw!

105
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,121
Geez!

106
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,412
Yes, ma'am.

107
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,114
Can I help you?

108
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:00,693
Fresh,

109
00:16:00,727 --> 00:16:02,629
made this week.

110
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:13,106
Hi, big boy.

111
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,820
[speaking Chinese]

112
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:33,260
Little lady...

113
00:16:34,261 --> 00:16:36,896
...I think you might
got the wrong man.

114
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:39,432
Maybe even the wrong country.
Ain't that right, boys?

115
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:41,801
[laughter]

116
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,236
[speaking Chinese]

117
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:49,042
Seems like you didn't bother
to learn English, either.

118
00:16:49,076 --> 00:16:51,944
Can speak perfect English.

119
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:57,150
Let's just forget
about the English.

120
00:16:57,184 --> 00:17:01,421
Doesn't seem like math is one
of your strong points, lady.

121
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:04,691
Kinda looks like you're a little
bit out numbered here.

122
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,329
[gunshots]

123
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,332
[people shouting]

124
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:19,872
*

125
00:18:08,988 --> 00:18:10,823
Thank you all for coming.

126
00:18:10,857 --> 00:18:13,193
We all thought you were dead.

127
00:18:13,226 --> 00:18:15,228
Rumor had it you went out
in a blaze of glory

128
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:16,829
at Gatesfield.

129
00:18:16,863 --> 00:18:18,398
No,

130
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:20,267
just layin' low.

131
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,204
So,

132
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:25,772
we're here.

133
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:30,076
The town's called Flatridge.

134
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,411
I've heard of it.

135
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,180
Mostly women.

136
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:35,415
That's where I settled after...

137
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:37,184
...You left.

138
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,324
Look,

139
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:46,893
we did what we had to do,

140
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:48,895
but after Wells
I started to feel like

141
00:18:48,928 --> 00:18:50,197
we had outrun our course.

142
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,898
What does that mean?

143
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:54,501
It means, Chas, that what
happened that afternoon

144
00:18:54,534 --> 00:18:57,069
has haunted me for a long time.

145
00:18:57,103 --> 00:19:01,007
And I vowed never to return
to that life, ever.

146
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,944
So that's why you
disappeared soon after.

147
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,947
I found a different life
at Flatridge.

148
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:13,019
I stayed with my sister for a
while and everything was great.

149
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:15,154
But things started to change.

150
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:20,293
Rumors of gold
and a town full of women

151
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:22,262
seemed to attract
the scum of the earth.

152
00:19:22,295 --> 00:19:24,130
I'm gonna give you cowards
one last chance

153
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,466
to get out of my town.

154
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,000
[gunshot]

155
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:29,569
[gunshot]

156
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,137
[gunshot]

157
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,639
Before long,

158
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:36,276
Flatridge was everything I was
trying to get away from.

159
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,357
I tried to persuade her
to leave.

160
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,593
She wanted to stay.

161
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,130
And they killed her.

162
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:01,968
And I wanna find them.

163
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:09,942
So let's get this straight,
Rachel.

164
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,413
You want only revenge?

165
00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:15,682
They killed my sister.

166
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:18,017
I don't need more than that.

167
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,453
With all due respect, Rachel,

168
00:20:20,487 --> 00:20:22,188
I do.

169
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,424
Fine, Maria, you don't
have to go.

170
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:25,625
Then I'm out.

171
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:29,329
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold up.

172
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:31,564
This ain't getting us nowhere.

173
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:40,640
Now all let's chill out
for one hot minute.

174
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:42,975
Okay?

175
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:44,477
Please.

176
00:21:02,228 --> 00:21:04,431
Okay guys, listen up.

177
00:21:06,232 --> 00:21:08,335
I know all about this town.

178
00:21:08,368 --> 00:21:10,303
And if Rachel asked us
to come here,

179
00:21:10,337 --> 00:21:13,105
the least we can do
is hear her out.

180
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,109
I wanna know about the gold.

181
00:21:21,581 --> 00:21:23,082
Okay.

182
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:27,420
An ex-boyfriend told me

183
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:29,422
that some wealthy cattle farmer

184
00:21:29,456 --> 00:21:31,358
left over
half a million dollars

185
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:34,293
worth of gold and jewelry
in that town.

186
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:37,730
Whaddya mean "left?"

187
00:21:39,098 --> 00:21:42,168
Rumor has it that he left
it all to his only son,

188
00:21:42,201 --> 00:21:44,671
who buried it
somewhere in Flatridge.

189
00:21:44,704 --> 00:21:46,373
Where?

190
00:21:46,406 --> 00:21:48,375
I would imagine
somewhere in a grave.

191
00:21:48,408 --> 00:21:49,609
Maybe...

192
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:52,244
The problem is nobody knows.

193
00:21:52,278 --> 00:21:53,746
Could be in a grave.

194
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:57,216
Could be under
some poor bastard's house,
for all we know.

195
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:59,118
No problem.

196
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,520
Then we find son.

197
00:22:00,553 --> 00:22:02,789
That'd be kinda hard, Zhing.

198
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:05,291
He's dead.
- Here we go.

199
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:08,361
And the son is supposedly
buried right next to the chest.

200
00:22:08,395 --> 00:22:11,564
The thing is
nobody knows where.

201
00:22:11,598 --> 00:22:12,765
Simple.

202
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,735
We find the undertaker
who buried the son.

203
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:18,538
He died a year later.

204
00:22:18,571 --> 00:22:20,139
Of course.

205
00:22:32,485 --> 00:22:34,186
What about a map?

206
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,759
Rumored to be
somewhere in Flatridge.

207
00:22:43,129 --> 00:22:44,764
And by the way,

208
00:22:44,797 --> 00:22:47,467
how do you know so much
about the chest, anyway, Chas?

209
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,169
An ex-boyfriend I dated
told me.

210
00:22:51,638 --> 00:22:53,339
What happened to him?

211
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:56,142
We had a bad breakup.

212
00:23:04,617 --> 00:23:06,819
*

213
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:59,465
Where do you think
you're goin'?

214
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,534
I don't know
what I was thinkin'.

215
00:25:01,568 --> 00:25:03,703
Those two ain't never
gonna change.

216
00:25:03,736 --> 00:25:05,371
Don't take it personal.

217
00:25:05,404 --> 00:25:07,473
Chastity, can you believe them?

218
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,308
My sister is dead
and they in there talkin'

219
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,710
about gold and jewelry.

220
00:25:10,743 --> 00:25:12,812
I don't think they meant
anything by that.

221
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:16,916
Everybody's got different needs
now, Rachel.

222
00:25:16,949 --> 00:25:18,317
It don't make it right.

223
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,286
It don't make it wrong.

224
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:24,423
Listen, when we
were robbin' those banks,

225
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:27,660
you made the decision
to leave that life.

226
00:25:27,694 --> 00:25:30,296
I never judged you for that.

227
00:25:32,999 --> 00:25:35,568
I had to leave, Chastity.

228
00:25:35,602 --> 00:25:37,003
I know.

229
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:40,272
The problem is, when you left,

230
00:25:40,306 --> 00:25:42,642
you left your friends behind.

231
00:25:59,826 --> 00:26:01,560
We think about offer.

232
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:10,036
Gang worth big bucks.

233
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:12,304
Left Eye worth more.

234
00:26:14,707 --> 00:26:16,308
I ride with you.

235
00:26:16,676 --> 00:26:19,345
*

236
00:26:27,887 --> 00:26:29,055
Maria?

237
00:26:36,395 --> 00:26:37,563
I'm in.

238
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:41,968
That's my girls!

239
00:26:42,001 --> 00:26:43,770
One favor, though.

240
00:26:45,371 --> 00:26:47,373
While we're there anyway,

241
00:26:47,406 --> 00:26:50,009
maybe keep an eye out
on that map.

242
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:51,644
Sure.

243
00:26:51,678 --> 00:26:53,880
Little somethin' for everybody.

244
00:27:00,052 --> 00:27:02,554
Can't hurt to take Him along.

245
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:07,760
Lord,

246
00:27:07,794 --> 00:27:10,429
thou art my battle axe

247
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,832
and weapon of war.

248
00:27:12,865 --> 00:27:16,936
For with thee I will break
into pieces the nations,

249
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:19,438
and with thee

250
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,373
I will destroy mine enemies.

251
00:27:21,407 --> 00:27:23,442
Amen.
- Amen.

252
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,844
Amen.

253
00:27:24,877 --> 00:27:27,579
*

254
00:27:35,822 --> 00:27:37,423
Wait a minute.

255
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:39,892
Wait a minute.
What about Kim?

256
00:28:04,751 --> 00:28:07,453
[Judge]
For the crimes committed
against the sovereign state

257
00:28:07,486 --> 00:28:10,622
ranging from horse theft,
cattle theft, bank robbery,

258
00:28:10,656 --> 00:28:14,460
assault on persons
and properties, jailbreaks.

259
00:28:14,493 --> 00:28:17,563
For crimes committed
against this state, Kim Brigham,

260
00:28:17,596 --> 00:28:19,832
you've been tried
and condemned to death,

261
00:28:19,866 --> 00:28:22,168
to be hung until you're dead.

262
00:28:29,675 --> 00:28:31,844
Kim Brigham,

263
00:28:31,878 --> 00:28:34,513
if you have any last words,

264
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,715
say them now.

265
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:41,754
You feel me, baby?
- Huh?

266
00:28:41,788 --> 00:28:43,522
I can tell you ain't seen
a vagina

267
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:44,857
since your momma
gave birth to you.

268
00:28:44,891 --> 00:28:47,159
[stammering]
Are those your final words?

269
00:28:47,193 --> 00:28:49,661
Come on, baby, I know you
wanna spread my thighs...

270
00:28:49,695 --> 00:28:52,731
Shut her up!
- ...and shove your big, fat--

271
00:29:33,205 --> 00:29:34,606
[coughs]

272
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,915
[gunshot]

273
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:45,751
Good luck, ladies.

274
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,586
Ha! Ha!
[gunshot]

275
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,755

278
00:30:13,112 --> 00:30:14,914
Yo, Kim! Here!

279
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:16,815
I'm right here.

280
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:19,952

282
00:30:20,953 --> 00:30:23,589
The gang is back, y'all.
Yah!

283
00:30:23,622 --> 00:30:25,958

I'm goin' back.

287
00:30:54,153 --> 00:30:55,054
What?

288
00:30:55,087 --> 00:30:57,156
Yah.
I'm going back.

289
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:59,959
Going back?
Kim, are you crazy?

290
00:30:59,992 --> 00:31:02,128
You gonna get on
with that bullshit, girl.

291
00:31:02,161 --> 00:31:04,063
Kim, no.

292
00:31:04,096 --> 00:31:06,132
Those bastards
tried to kill me.

293
00:31:06,165 --> 00:31:08,000
I'm goin' back!

294
00:31:09,001 --> 00:31:10,602
It's payback!

295
00:31:10,636 --> 00:31:12,104
I know this was a bad idea.

296
00:31:12,138 --> 00:31:14,140
Kim, no!

297
00:31:21,981 --> 00:31:25,251
Two roads, the past
and the future.

298
00:31:25,284 --> 00:31:27,686
Leave the pain in the past.

299
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:33,092
Kim!
- Yah! Yah!

300
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:34,826
Yah!

301
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:47,673
Oh man, you gotta
be kidding me.

302
00:31:47,706 --> 00:31:49,708
This is disgusting.

303
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:52,078
I mean, there's gotta be
a better way
of finding this chest.

304
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:56,815
Jean, when you find
a better way, you let me know.

305
00:31:58,985 --> 00:32:00,186
Keep diggin'.

306
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:06,358
Looks to me he got
what he had coming.

307
00:32:17,103 --> 00:32:19,171
[women laughing]

308
00:32:23,109 --> 00:32:26,145
No, really,

309
00:32:26,178 --> 00:32:29,048
I gotta thank you all
for coming through when you did.

310
00:32:30,716 --> 00:32:32,784
'Cause it was close.

311
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,026
Hey...

312
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:42,228
...look like Chinese fish.

00:32:46,065 --> 00:32:48,400
Yeah, want whiskey.

[laughter]

318
00:32:56,308 --> 00:33:00,912
Which one of you hussies
missed that first shot?

319
00:33:00,946 --> 00:33:03,182
'Cause that shit was not sexy.

320
00:33:03,215 --> 00:33:05,117
Well, actually,
I thought you looked kinda cool

321
00:33:05,151 --> 00:33:08,420
swingin' back and forth
like that.

322
00:33:08,454 --> 00:33:09,955
Any longer swing like that,

323
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,058
you woulda had my ass
in a trance.

324
00:33:12,091 --> 00:33:13,959
[laughter]

325
00:33:18,264 --> 00:33:20,299
What's wrong with her?

326
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:22,834
I think we found our hussy.

327
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:27,473
Thank God Chas hit
that second shot.

328
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:30,309
Oh, about that.

329
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:32,111
Got a confession.
- Yeah?

330
00:33:32,144 --> 00:33:34,046
It wasn't me.

331
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,015
[giggling]
I was goin' for the judge.

332
00:33:40,152 --> 00:33:42,088
That ain't funny.

333
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,391
Oh, yeah?

334
00:33:45,424 --> 00:33:47,493
Whaddya gonna do about it?

335
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:51,430
On the count.

336
00:33:58,170 --> 00:33:59,938
One...

337
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:03,842
...two...

338
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:06,011
...three.

339
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,946
I won that shit.
- Oh, no.

340
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:10,349
[laughter]

341
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:12,284
You know I did.
you know I did!

342
00:34:12,318 --> 00:34:15,187
I won that shit.

343
00:34:15,221 --> 00:34:18,157
*

344
00:36:00,926 --> 00:36:02,127
Everything okay?

345
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,129
Everything's fine.

346
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,497
So...

347
00:36:06,332 --> 00:36:08,133
...what's the plan?

348
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,401
Simple.

349
00:36:09,435 --> 00:36:10,969
We kill 'em,

350
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,572
then find the jewelry
and the gold.

351
00:36:13,605 --> 00:36:15,207
Sounds like a plan to me.

352
00:36:15,241 --> 00:36:17,042
Hold up.

353
00:36:17,075 --> 00:36:19,110
How we gonna kill 'em
if we don't even know
what they look like?

354
00:36:19,144 --> 00:36:21,112
We're lookin' for Left Eye,
right?

355
00:36:21,146 --> 00:36:22,314
Yeah.

356
00:36:22,348 --> 00:36:24,316
Then we find the guy
with one good right eye

357
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:26,218
and kill him.

358
00:36:26,252 --> 00:36:28,086
But what if they
call him Left Eye

359
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:30,188
because he's got
one good left eye?

360
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,160
Rachel?

361
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,428
We wait.

362
00:36:37,463 --> 00:36:40,466
We settle in the inn
for a couple of days,

363
00:36:40,499 --> 00:36:42,634
monitor their activity,

364
00:36:42,668 --> 00:36:44,069
and then make our move.

365
00:36:44,102 --> 00:36:45,671
And the gold and the jewelry?

366
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:47,639
We have plenty of time
for your gold.

367
00:36:47,673 --> 00:36:49,040
And the jewelry.

368
00:36:50,342 --> 00:36:52,177
And the jewelry.
Come on.

369
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:17,235
*

370
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,051
You think they recognize you?

371
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,219
I don't know.

372
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,455
I left here a long time ago.

373
00:37:36,488 --> 00:37:40,058
I thought you said this town
was mostly women.

374
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,393
Used to be.

375
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,595
Things have changed.

376
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:48,066
I kinda like the change.

377
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:52,070
Don't you ever
get tired of that, Chas?

378
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:55,240
I feel about men the same way
you feel about money.

379
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,543
So much of it,

380
00:37:57,576 --> 00:37:59,578
so little time.

381
00:38:02,247 --> 00:38:04,282
*

382
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,736
I think we hit the jackpot,
baby.

383
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,480
*

384
00:38:39,418 --> 00:38:41,787
I say we kill 'em all.

385
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,655
[giggling]

386
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:52,230
Can I help you ladies?

387
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:53,465
Yeah,

388
00:38:53,499 --> 00:38:56,334
can I get four shots of whiskey
for my friends?

389
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:00,138
We don't serve your kind here.

390
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:06,311
And what kind is that?

391
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,646
Ladies.

392
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:12,451
Whoever said we was ladies,
snot bucket?

393
00:39:12,484 --> 00:39:14,252
See,

394
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:16,154
my friends get a little nervous
when they're thirsty.

395
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:19,090
So I think you might
wanna rethink that order.

396
00:39:21,593 --> 00:39:23,194
Yes, ma'am.

397
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:32,638
Pardon me, miss.

398
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:38,276
I just wanted to extend the
welcome to you and your friends.

399
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:41,179
I noticed you're not
from around here.

400
00:39:52,858 --> 00:39:54,560
Stayin' for a while?

401
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:58,196
Actually, we're just
passing through.

402
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,231
You know, a couple days.

403
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:03,234
Business or pleasure?

404
00:40:03,835 --> 00:40:06,738
I would say business.

405
00:40:07,573 --> 00:40:09,541
Allow me to introduce myself.

406
00:40:09,575 --> 00:40:11,543
My name is Malone.

407
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:13,679
And you are?

408
00:40:13,712 --> 00:40:15,380
Chas.

409
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,682
Chas?

410
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,585
Short for Chastity.

411
00:40:20,586 --> 00:40:22,320
[laughs]

412
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:24,189
Okay.
- What's so funny?

413
00:40:24,222 --> 00:40:27,325
No, just... just your name.

414
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:29,327
Hey, Babyface.

415
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,729
I'll be right there.

416
00:40:32,664 --> 00:40:34,466
Babyface?

417
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,835
It's just something.
When I was a kid. It just...

418
00:40:36,868 --> 00:40:38,904
It just stayed with me.

419
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:41,272
Yeah, okay.

420
00:40:42,207 --> 00:40:43,742
Well, um...

421
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:45,677
Maybe I could see you later.

422
00:40:45,711 --> 00:40:47,178
Maybe?

423
00:40:47,713 --> 00:40:49,280
Maybe.

424
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:06,698
[no audible dialogue]

425
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:19,545
Come on, let's go.

426
00:41:19,578 --> 00:41:21,713
Wait, I haven't
finished drinking.

427
00:41:58,016 --> 00:42:00,852
*

428
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:02,013
Here, take a look.

429
00:43:12,991 --> 00:43:15,326
Yeah, that's them.

430
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:18,897
Damn, I didn't think there was
gonna be so many of them.

431
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:20,398
Bandits?

432
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:22,567
No. Dead people.

433
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,636
I worry about the ones
that are alive.

434
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:27,472
I think there's more of them
back in town.

435
00:43:27,505 --> 00:43:29,574
Five or fifty, it don't matter.

436
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:30,909
We can do this right now.

437
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:33,812
What, you got a death wish
or something?

438
00:43:33,845 --> 00:43:35,346
Why you gotta be all that?

439
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:38,650
I'm here to collect bodies,
not bounty.

440
00:43:38,684 --> 00:43:40,886
Are you better than us?

441
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:02,073
Georgy, Sue!

442
00:44:10,415 --> 00:44:11,783
The hell is it?

443
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,453
It's the map.

444
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:16,755
It's a map.

445
00:44:20,959 --> 00:44:22,627
Stop digging.

446
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,629
Hey, we found it.

447
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,732
Whoo! We found it!

448
00:44:26,765 --> 00:44:28,533
What's happening?

449
00:44:28,566 --> 00:44:29,968
I don't know.
From the looks of things,

450
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:31,937
they must have found something.

451
00:44:31,970 --> 00:44:33,571
You think it was the map?

452
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:35,340
I don't know.

453
00:44:36,107 --> 00:44:39,444
Come on.
Let's head back into town.

454
00:44:39,477 --> 00:44:42,047
Wait, by the way,
where's Chastity?

455
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,816
*

456
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:50,488
Wait a minute.

457
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:51,356
What?

458
00:44:52,123 --> 00:44:53,825
We just met.

459
00:44:56,094 --> 00:44:59,497
Actually, we met yesterday.

460
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,435
I can't argue with that.

461
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:08,706
[groaning]

462
00:45:09,607 --> 00:45:11,476
What?
What is it?

463
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:16,782
I just have a feeling that
I know how this is gonna end.

464
00:45:16,815 --> 00:45:18,884
Let's not worry
about that right now.

465
00:45:21,019 --> 00:45:24,055
If I were you, I would.

466
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:26,825
Why?

467
00:45:30,862 --> 00:45:32,697
Let's just say,

468
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:35,033
when I break up,

469
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:37,969
I really... break up.

470
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:42,673
Look, Chas, all I know is

471
00:45:42,707 --> 00:45:46,812
when I first saw you nothing
in this world mattered to me.

472
00:45:46,845 --> 00:45:51,082
You were so perfect.
I mean, you just looked right.

473
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:57,488
I got you this.

474
00:45:58,656 --> 00:46:00,792
Oh...

475
00:46:00,826 --> 00:46:02,693
...it's beautiful.

476
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:05,931
Oh, baby, it's beautiful.

477
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:12,670
*

478
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:54,645
Tell me what this is.

479
00:46:56,114 --> 00:46:57,983
You lied to me!

480
00:46:59,217 --> 00:47:00,785
Well, I uh,

481
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:02,854
I don't understand.

482
00:47:02,888 --> 00:47:05,123
Let me help you understand.

483
00:47:06,057 --> 00:47:08,026
Let me explain to you.

484
00:47:08,059 --> 00:47:10,128
We found half of a map

485
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:12,597
inside of a coffin.

486
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:14,732
But what we didn't find
in that coffin

487
00:47:14,765 --> 00:47:18,069
was a body,
or any chest of gold!

488
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:22,807
Seems to me, right,

489
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:26,311
whoever put this map
inside that coffin...

490
00:47:27,946 --> 00:47:30,715
...probably knows
where the other half is.

491
00:47:30,748 --> 00:47:35,286
And maybe you can tell us
who that other person is,
Sheriff.

492
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:39,290
I... I don't know.

493
00:47:39,324 --> 00:47:40,825
[laughter]

494
00:47:45,796 --> 00:47:47,265
Wrong answer.

495
00:47:51,336 --> 00:47:52,803
What?

496
00:47:53,804 --> 00:47:55,006
Hey!

497
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,142
Hey!
Jesus Christ--

498
00:47:57,175 --> 00:48:00,545
You know why ten is such
a beautiful number?

499
00:48:02,813 --> 00:48:05,616
'Cause it's less painful
than nine.

500
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:06,884
[gunshot]
Ah!

501
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,289
So, what do we do now?

502
00:48:11,322 --> 00:48:13,158
We keep digging.

503
00:48:13,824 --> 00:48:15,026
The wells.

504
00:48:18,696 --> 00:48:21,832
Grr, my f--
What'd you do?

505
00:48:21,866 --> 00:48:23,068
[grunts]

506
00:48:24,235 --> 00:48:26,737
Stop crying
like a little bitch!

507
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:44,855
*

508
00:49:04,442 --> 00:49:06,344
You got a problem?

509
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:11,016
No.

510
00:49:11,049 --> 00:49:12,083
No problem.

511
00:49:12,117 --> 00:49:13,784
That's what I thought.

512
00:49:48,886 --> 00:49:50,955
Why...

513
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:52,723
...would...

514
00:49:53,324 --> 00:49:54,792
...they go after the sheriff?

515
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:56,327
Ain't he down with them?

516
00:49:57,495 --> 00:50:00,031
He knows somethin'
he ain't telling.

517
00:50:00,065 --> 00:50:02,233
About the gold?
- And the jewelry.

518
00:50:05,503 --> 00:50:06,271
Maybe.

519
00:50:07,505 --> 00:50:09,974
So they sent everybody
a message.

520
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:11,742
Exactly.

521
00:50:11,776 --> 00:50:13,978
Shoot the sheriff
in the finger so...

522
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:15,813
...whoever has the other half
of the map

523
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:17,448
will be itching to make a move.

524
00:50:18,783 --> 00:50:19,984
I say to hell with 'em.

525
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:22,420
I say they want drama,
let's bring 'em drama.

526
00:50:25,323 --> 00:50:26,924
How many?

527
00:50:26,957 --> 00:50:29,260
I count 25 total.

528
00:50:29,294 --> 00:50:32,063
26 if you count
the nine-fingered sheriff.

529
00:50:32,097 --> 00:50:33,331
What's the problem?

530
00:50:33,364 --> 00:50:36,033
There's five of us.
Let's do this.

531
00:50:37,168 --> 00:50:39,237
I don't see a problem.

532
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:41,172
I'll tell you
what the problem is.

533
00:50:41,206 --> 00:50:43,074
They found a piece of the map.

534
00:50:43,108 --> 00:50:44,242
So?

535
00:50:44,275 --> 00:50:46,277
So, if they gonna lead us
to the chest,

536
00:50:46,311 --> 00:50:48,113
then why we rushin'?

537
00:50:51,216 --> 00:50:54,419
Look, Rachel said a little
somethin' for everybody, right?

538
00:50:54,452 --> 00:50:56,821
A couple of more days
ain't gonna make a difference.

539
00:50:56,854 --> 00:51:00,091
I'm just sayin', everybody
can get what they want.

540
00:51:00,125 --> 00:51:02,860
Kim, another day doesn't
make a difference to you.

541
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:04,529
Kill 'em today or tomorrow.

542
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:07,031
Zhang, you still get
your bounty.

543
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:10,168
Rachel, another day doesn't
bring your sister back.

544
00:51:10,201 --> 00:51:12,203
And Chas...

545
00:51:12,237 --> 00:51:14,505
I already found what I wanted.

546
00:51:16,207 --> 00:51:17,842
Fine, whatever.

547
00:51:17,875 --> 00:51:20,911
Plus we all walk away with a
half a million dollars in gold.

548
00:51:24,215 --> 00:51:27,385
Look, I want them as dead
as all of you,

549
00:51:27,418 --> 00:51:30,455
but I'm just askin'
for a couple of more days.

550
00:51:30,488 --> 00:51:32,257
A couple of more days.

551
00:51:38,163 --> 00:51:40,265
We lay low one more day.

552
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:46,437
*

553
00:52:33,951 --> 00:52:35,386
Welcome back.

554
00:52:36,921 --> 00:52:39,957
What are you... ladies having?

555
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,293
[speaking Chinese]

556
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:46,063
Yes, ma'am.

557
00:52:46,096 --> 00:52:47,465
Comin' right up.

558
00:53:07,318 --> 00:53:09,487
I'll be right back.

559
00:53:18,996 --> 00:53:22,500
I'm beginning to think that girl
even has sex with money.

560
00:53:35,112 --> 00:53:37,548
*

561
00:53:58,503 --> 00:54:02,307
Lots of deputies, but no law.

562
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:04,509
Funny, I was thinking
the same thing.

563
00:54:05,743 --> 00:54:08,178
What will it be, pretty lady?

564
00:54:11,749 --> 00:54:13,584
I'll raise five.

565
00:54:16,053 --> 00:54:17,422
Mister?

566
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:22,693
I'll raise a ten.

567
00:54:31,536 --> 00:54:33,003
Let's see 'em.

568
00:54:37,207 --> 00:54:38,943
Read 'em and weep.

569
00:54:44,449 --> 00:54:47,251
The world's full
of surprises, Mister.

570
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:51,389
I wouldn't touch that money.

571
00:55:02,367 --> 00:55:04,101
I guess your momma
never taught you

572
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:05,736
that winnin' ain't everything.

573
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:08,606
It's how you pay the game.

574
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:10,341
[gunshots]

575
00:55:10,375 --> 00:55:12,777
[people shouting]

576
00:55:21,419 --> 00:55:23,654
So much for layin' low.

577
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:36,333
[gunshot]

578
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:39,303
Somebody in this town

579
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:41,472
knows where the other half
of that map is.

580
00:55:41,506 --> 00:55:43,240
And I say

581
00:55:43,273 --> 00:55:46,811
we raise a little hell until
that somebody comes clean.

582
00:55:46,844 --> 00:55:49,279
[gunshot]
You're drunk.

583
00:55:50,748 --> 00:55:53,217
That's something you never had,
Little Suzie...

584
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:56,253
...patience.
- I'm for that.

585
00:55:56,286 --> 00:55:59,390
I'm ready to bring some
serious pain to this town.

586
00:55:59,424 --> 00:56:02,259
We're gonna find the map
sooner than you guys think.

587
00:56:04,128 --> 00:56:05,496
[gunshot]

588
00:56:06,631 --> 00:56:09,467
They killed Otto and others.

589
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:10,435
What?

590
00:56:11,769 --> 00:56:13,103
What are you talkin' about,
"they killed Otto?"

591
00:56:13,137 --> 00:56:13,771
Who?

592
00:56:13,804 --> 00:56:15,440
Some women. Girls.

593
00:56:15,473 --> 00:56:19,109
They come in the saloon,
shot him up.

594
00:56:19,143 --> 00:56:20,511
Girls?

595
00:56:20,545 --> 00:56:23,180
Gunslinger types.
I ain't never seen them before.

596
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:24,682
How many of them was there?

597
00:56:24,715 --> 00:56:26,183
Three, maybe four.

598
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:27,852
Were they wearing badges?

599
00:56:27,885 --> 00:56:31,288
The girls?
- Otto!

600
00:56:31,321 --> 00:56:32,623
Yeah, yeah.

601
00:56:32,657 --> 00:56:34,058
Go!

602
00:56:34,725 --> 00:56:36,126
Find them!

603
00:56:37,895 --> 00:56:40,531
I wanna make sure these girls
are sorry they ever
stepped foot in my town.

604
00:56:40,565 --> 00:56:42,366
Come on, let's go.

605
00:56:49,507 --> 00:56:51,876
Damn it, Kim, it wasn't
supposed to go down like that!

606
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:54,445
What was I supposed to do?
Just stand there?

607
00:56:54,479 --> 00:56:56,647
You were supposed to remember
the damn plan.

608
00:56:56,681 --> 00:56:59,316
We lay low until we find out
their next move.

609
00:56:59,349 --> 00:57:01,285
I don't lay low for nobody.

610
00:57:01,318 --> 00:57:02,887
And you were about to use them
for target practice

611
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,188
with your damn knifes.

612
00:57:04,221 --> 00:57:05,322
You tellin' me
about layin' low.

613
00:57:05,355 --> 00:57:06,724
I wasn't gonna kill 'em.

614
00:57:06,757 --> 00:57:09,193
I hadn't gotten my money yet.

615
00:57:09,226 --> 00:57:10,394
Yeah,

616
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:11,562
look,

617
00:57:11,596 --> 00:57:12,897
all I wanna know

618
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:15,700
is whether Babyface
is a part of that crazy gang.

619
00:57:25,242 --> 00:57:26,711
Shit!

620
00:57:31,882 --> 00:57:33,884
Now we're targets.

621
00:57:37,421 --> 00:57:38,623
Let's go.

622
00:58:54,865 --> 00:58:57,501
*

623
00:59:27,865 --> 00:59:29,967
[people chattering]

624
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:48,686
Drink.

625
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:51,588
Any particular type, lady?

626
00:59:55,059 --> 00:59:57,427
I'll bring you a whiskey.

627
01:00:33,597 --> 01:00:35,800
You know somebody
named Chastity?

628
01:00:36,867 --> 01:00:38,869
I might have heard
that name before.

629
01:00:45,710 --> 01:00:47,544
What did she look like?

630
01:00:58,723 --> 01:00:59,990
Everything all right?

631
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:04,628
Everything's cool,
just thinking,

632
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:05,996
that's all.

633
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:12,069
What are you thinking about?

634
01:01:12,102 --> 01:01:13,337
Love.

635
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:17,641
Yeah, well, my mom always said

636
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:19,143
don't go looking for love,

637
01:01:19,176 --> 01:01:20,577
look for respect.

638
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:24,114
Even that they ain't
gonna give you.

639
01:01:26,016 --> 01:01:28,786
So you make them
give it to you.

640
01:01:28,819 --> 01:01:30,354
With this.

641
01:01:32,823 --> 01:01:35,425
How far you think
that's gonna get you, Kim?

642
01:01:35,459 --> 01:01:36,660
Really?

643
01:01:38,195 --> 01:01:39,930
Far enough.

644
01:01:39,964 --> 01:01:42,466
Well, at some point
it's gotta stop, right?

645
01:01:42,499 --> 01:01:44,501
All the shooting and killing.

646
01:01:45,669 --> 01:01:47,738
Stop? Shit.

647
01:01:47,772 --> 01:01:50,640
I'm going out
in a blaze of glory.

648
01:01:50,674 --> 01:01:53,177
Just like the boys do it.

649
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:56,613
Boys either wind up dead,
in prison,

650
01:01:56,646 --> 01:01:58,515
or hanging from a rope.

651
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:02,119
That's your idea of glory?
Well, it's plain stupid to me.

652
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:09,159
I don't know what you want,

653
01:02:09,193 --> 01:02:10,861
but your
holier than thou attitude

654
01:02:10,895 --> 01:02:13,931
is getting on my last nerve.

655
01:02:13,964 --> 01:02:16,033
I'm not perfect.
I've made mistakes.

656
01:02:16,066 --> 01:02:18,002
That shit I have to deal with.

657
01:02:18,035 --> 01:02:20,170
You're not my mother,
you're not my father,

658
01:02:20,204 --> 01:02:22,739
and I'm getting sick and tired
of your preachin'.

659
01:02:25,876 --> 01:02:29,213
Don't you ever
call me stupid again.

660
01:02:33,550 --> 01:02:35,519
I didn't mean nothin' by it.

661
01:02:36,921 --> 01:02:38,889
You know how Kim is.

662
01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:46,096
*

663
01:02:54,104 --> 01:02:56,606
Kim?
- Shit!

664
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:59,609
I lost it.
- What?

665
01:03:07,584 --> 01:03:09,119
I'll be right back.

666
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:11,155
Where the hell are you going?

667
01:03:11,188 --> 01:03:12,789
For a ride.

668
01:03:14,591 --> 01:03:16,093
Yah! Yah!

669
01:03:45,789 --> 01:03:47,124
Where's Kim going?

670
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:49,793
She says she needs
to go for a ride.

671
01:03:57,767 --> 01:04:00,137
*

672
01:05:58,922 --> 01:06:00,124
Shit.

673
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:15,939
Here's your rifle, Sheriff.

674
01:06:17,141 --> 01:06:19,043
Thank you, sweetheart.

675
01:06:20,777 --> 01:06:22,046
[grunts]

676
01:06:27,384 --> 01:06:30,120
Baby, let's get
out of here tonight.

677
01:06:34,324 --> 01:06:36,760
Are you crazy or what, Brenda?

678
01:06:36,793 --> 01:06:38,295
That'd be a mistake, sweetheart.

679
01:06:38,328 --> 01:06:40,830
Wouldn't make it half a mile
before Left Eye found out.

680
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:45,269
Here, give me a hand, will ya?

681
01:06:45,302 --> 01:06:47,003
Pull on that tight.

682
01:06:48,072 --> 01:06:50,407
There you go.
Tight. Tighter.

683
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:51,741
Easy.

684
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:55,412
[gunshot]

685
01:06:58,948 --> 01:07:00,484
Don't move, Brenda.

686
01:07:26,310 --> 01:07:28,044
A deposit, please.

687
01:07:35,552 --> 01:07:37,221
Everything okay?

688
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:41,091
Yeah, stick to the plan,

689
01:07:41,125 --> 01:07:43,127
no one gets hurt.

690
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:46,130
I love you all.
- We love you, too.

691
01:07:46,163 --> 01:07:48,165
Cool.
Let's go.

692
01:07:48,198 --> 01:07:49,833
Hey, Kim?

693
01:07:49,866 --> 01:07:52,236
I know, nobody gets hurt.

694
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:55,505
We're not gonna hurt you.
Get in front of us.

695
01:07:55,539 --> 01:07:58,208
The sisters are in the house.

696
01:07:58,242 --> 01:08:00,844
You're not gonna hurt nobody,
all right?

697
01:08:00,877 --> 01:08:04,548
[gunfire]

698
01:08:04,581 --> 01:08:05,482
No!

699
01:08:08,985 --> 01:08:10,987
No!
- No!

700
01:08:11,888 --> 01:08:13,323
No.

701
01:08:13,357 --> 01:08:14,991
No.

702
01:08:18,995 --> 01:08:20,230
Rachel?

703
01:08:21,198 --> 01:08:22,266
You okay?

704
01:08:24,268 --> 01:08:26,203
Somebody's comin'.

705
01:08:29,873 --> 01:08:32,342
Kim! Kim!
- Wake up, wake up!

706
01:08:33,910 --> 01:08:35,212
Get the canteen.

707
01:08:37,013 --> 01:08:39,416
She's still breathing.
Get the canteen.

708
01:08:44,354 --> 01:08:45,522
Drink.

709
01:08:45,555 --> 01:08:47,056
No, wait.
She's trying to say something.

710
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:48,458
[coughs]

711
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,028
[grunts]

712
01:08:52,061 --> 01:08:55,064
Sh- sh--
- What?

713
01:08:55,098 --> 01:08:57,534
Don't talk, just drink.

714
01:09:00,036 --> 01:09:01,971
Don't talk.
Don't talk.

715
01:09:18,555 --> 01:09:20,424
Now is the time.

716
01:09:25,061 --> 01:09:26,330
I'm sorry.

717
01:09:49,118 --> 01:09:53,590
* Amazing grace

718
01:09:53,623 --> 01:09:58,094
* How sweet the sound

719
01:09:58,127 --> 01:10:05,869
* That saved a wretch like me

720
01:10:07,704 --> 01:10:12,642
* I once was lost

721
01:10:12,676 --> 01:10:17,046
* But now am found

722
01:10:18,147 --> 01:10:25,389
* Was blind but now I see

723
01:10:30,694 --> 01:10:32,629
Why did she go back?

724
01:10:34,030 --> 01:10:36,065
Why did she go back?

725
01:10:37,133 --> 01:10:39,469
When she was seven years old

726
01:10:39,503 --> 01:10:43,006
some men raped and killed
her mother.

727
01:10:44,574 --> 01:10:48,177
That watch was all she had
to remember her by.

728
01:10:52,181 --> 01:10:53,650
What now?

729
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:20,410
I stepped away from you all

730
01:11:20,444 --> 01:11:23,046
to clear my head,

731
01:11:23,079 --> 01:11:24,748
get closer to God.

732
01:11:30,086 --> 01:11:33,256
Things ain't- ain't
makin' sense no more.

733
01:11:35,091 --> 01:11:37,260
I've lost two of my sisters.

734
01:11:45,369 --> 01:11:47,704
Kim's death is my fault.

735
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:52,609
These nightmares
about the bank...

736
01:11:55,445 --> 01:11:58,147
I think my past is gonna
catch up to me.

737
01:12:11,795 --> 01:12:14,297
I think we should go
our separate ways

738
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:16,132
and, um...

739
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:19,235
...I'm gonna go ahead
into Flatridge

740
01:12:19,268 --> 01:12:21,771
and finish what we started.

741
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:30,647
Rachel?

742
01:12:31,781 --> 01:12:33,349
I understand.

743
01:12:34,117 --> 01:12:35,785
We understand.

744
01:12:39,756 --> 01:12:43,159
Last year I hunted an outlaw,
Johnny Ringo.

745
01:12:47,697 --> 01:12:49,799
And when I found him,

746
01:12:49,833 --> 01:12:52,636
he was with his son
and his wife

747
01:12:52,669 --> 01:12:55,238
and he begged for mercy.

748
01:12:55,271 --> 01:12:57,140
And so I walked away.

749
01:12:59,543 --> 01:13:03,847
A week later he tortured
a woman

750
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:06,182
in front of her child.

751
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:07,717
And then killed her.

752
01:13:08,652 --> 01:13:11,387
I walked away
because of emotion.

753
01:13:12,689 --> 01:13:16,493
We cannot allow emotion
to cloud the truth.

754
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:22,632
So, we here.

755
01:13:25,502 --> 01:13:27,136
We still here.

756
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:33,810
I don't wanna lose you guys.

757
01:13:48,925 --> 01:13:52,161
*

758
01:14:45,749 --> 01:14:48,251
*

759
01:15:06,636 --> 01:15:08,738
They're over there
in that old inn.

760
01:15:08,772 --> 01:15:11,274
I say we give 'em
everything we got.

761
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:14,978
Leave the sheriff to me.

762
01:15:15,011 --> 01:15:18,447
This time... it's personal.

763
01:15:22,418 --> 01:15:23,687
Come on.

764
01:15:24,588 --> 01:15:26,923
Hold- hold on.
Hold it. Hold it.

765
01:15:31,795 --> 01:15:34,430
I wanna tell you,
whatever happens,

766
01:15:34,463 --> 01:15:36,600
I love you guys to death,

767
01:15:36,633 --> 01:15:38,334
and I ain't never stopped.

768
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:39,636
Okay?

769
01:15:39,669 --> 01:15:41,370
I love you, too.

770
01:16:00,624 --> 01:16:01,958
Yah!

771
01:16:01,991 --> 01:16:04,360

772
01:16:26,349 --> 01:16:27,316
[knife flies]

773
01:16:28,051 --> 01:16:29,686
Going somewhere?

774
01:16:32,822 --> 01:16:34,991
I missed on purpose.

775
01:16:35,024 --> 01:16:36,760
[gunshot]
Hey.

776
01:16:37,927 --> 01:16:39,929
Hey.
[cocks gun]

777
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:45,401
You were the last words
on my dying friend's lips...

778
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:48,337
...and that really makes me mad.

779
01:16:48,371 --> 01:16:49,505
Now wait a minute,
that wash't me.

780
01:16:49,538 --> 01:16:51,374
Shut up!
[cocks gun]

781
01:16:52,108 --> 01:16:54,711
What do you know
about a gold chest?

782
01:16:54,744 --> 01:16:55,979
I don't know what
you're talkin' ab--

783
01:16:56,012 --> 01:16:57,413
[gunshot]

784
01:16:57,446 --> 01:16:59,515
Jesus.
[cocks gun]

785
01:16:59,548 --> 01:17:02,919
That's the last time
I'm gonna miss on purpose.

786
01:17:02,952 --> 01:17:04,520
You got that?

787
01:17:04,553 --> 01:17:06,389
Okay.

788
01:17:06,422 --> 01:17:07,423
Okay.

789
01:17:19,035 --> 01:17:22,105
This is the other part
of that map.

790
01:17:22,138 --> 01:17:24,640
The chest is in a well...

791
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:29,779
...and I know where.

792
01:17:29,813 --> 01:17:32,115
Wrong...
[cocks guns]

793
01:17:36,485 --> 01:17:37,721
...you used to know.

794
01:17:37,754 --> 01:17:38,822

[horse hooves approaching]

796
01:17:48,832 --> 01:17:50,900
What's the matter, baby?
- Shh.

797
01:17:52,068 --> 01:17:53,903
What's- what's--
- Shh.

801
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:51,828
I want them found,

802
01:18:51,861 --> 01:18:53,129
now.

803
01:18:53,162 --> 01:18:55,464
What do you think they want?

804
01:18:56,132 --> 01:18:57,733
I don't know.

805
01:19:04,974 --> 01:19:07,043
[gunfire]

806
01:19:38,607 --> 01:19:40,009
Damn.

807
01:19:40,043 --> 01:19:41,945
I didn't know there were
so many of 'em.

808
01:19:47,884 --> 01:19:49,118
You down?

809
01:19:53,589 --> 01:19:55,224
[speaks Chinese]

810
01:19:55,258 --> 01:19:57,193
I'll take that as a yes.

811
01:19:59,595 --> 01:20:01,264
[outlaw]
Let's go! Let's go!

812
01:20:01,297 --> 01:20:02,631
Let's go! Let's go!

814
01:20:32,228 --> 01:20:33,796

819
01:21:08,631 --> 01:21:10,967
I knew how this...

820
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,868
...was gonna end.

821
01:21:30,987 --> 01:21:32,621
Bastard.

Left Eye, the sheriff's gone.

01:21:43,232 --> 01:21:44,367
What?!

825
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:46,702
I have the men
searching everywhere.

826
01:21:46,735 --> 01:21:49,705
Listen, I don't care-

827
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:51,207
I don't care
if you have to kill

828
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:54,143
every living thing
in this town.

829
01:21:54,177 --> 01:21:56,212
Find him and kill him!

830

Will you do that for me?

831
01:21:57,413 --> 01:21:59,648
Kill everybody! Everybody!

832
01:21:59,682 --> 01:22:00,883

[gun cocks]
Drop your gun.

834
01:22:12,861 --> 01:22:13,963
You.

835
01:22:13,997 --> 01:22:15,231
Turn around.

836
01:22:26,175 --> 01:22:28,344
What is it you want?

837
01:22:28,377 --> 01:22:31,014
What do you want, gold?

838
01:22:31,047 --> 01:22:31,847
You want money?

839
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:35,218
You can't give me back
what I want.

840
01:22:35,251 --> 01:22:36,819
Before you die,

841
01:22:36,852 --> 01:22:38,154
I just wanted
to look into the eyes

842
01:22:38,187 --> 01:22:40,789

Don't shoot.

Take her into your bosom,
Lord...

851

...and give her the love that
no man could ever give her.

Mmm-hmm.

Bingo.

855
01:25:26,455 --> 01:25:28,924
Half a million dollars in gold.

856
01:25:34,963 --> 01:25:36,932
How do we get to it?

857
01:25:36,965 --> 01:25:39,568
Lucky for us the well is empty.

Lucky for me.

Everything okay?

861
01:25:52,648 --> 01:25:54,950
All the banks we robbed...

862
01:25:54,983 --> 01:25:59,355
...all the robberies,
no one innocent ever got hurt.

863
01:25:59,388 --> 01:26:02,491
That's what's bothering me.

864
01:26:05,961 --> 01:26:07,430

No!

868
01:26:15,504 --> 01:26:17,139
...not us.

869
01:26:20,643 --> 01:26:22,378
I know.

870
01:26:22,411 --> 01:26:24,012
Two roads...

871
01:26:24,647 --> 01:26:27,316
...the past and the future.

872
01:26:29,017 --> 01:26:31,620
Leave the pain in the past.

Y'all killed my sister,

but payback is a bitch.

876
01:27:33,382 --> 01:27:36,218
Now we're even.
