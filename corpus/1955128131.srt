00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,356
PSALMS

2
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:32,634
Somewhere in Jerusalem today

3
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,274
This old teaching

4
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,279
clarifies a specific point,

5
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,710
which helps us
understand the topic better.

6
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,430
The teaching speaks
about a man who cannot see.

7
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,354
In which direction should he pray?

8
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,957
A blind, a man who can't see where
the West, East, North, or South is,

9
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,240
and can't locate himself.
Who could that be for instance?

10
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,997
A man who can't locate himself,
who can't find the cardinal points:

11
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,629
someone who is on a boat at sea,
in the desert,

12
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,153
in a place from which he can't
orient himself, is considered blind.

13
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,754
He can't know where to turn to,

14
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,037
therefore he has a problem praying.

15
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,399
A disoriented person should turn
his heart to His Father in Heaven.

16
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,792
If you don't know
where Jerusalem is, the Western Wall,

17
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,077
where the Temple was,
what should you do?

18
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,630
What does the teaching suggest?

19
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,759
To turn our hearts
to Our Father in Heaven.

20
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,310
I want to expose this problem
to you,

21
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,079
I find it interesting.

22
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,073
Think about it,

23
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,715
what's the difference
between the Temple Mount,

24
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,551
as a direction for prayer,
and Our Father in Heaven?

25
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,719
Two very different things.

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,959
When directed towards Jerusalem,

27
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,040
what should one think about
in one's mind, in one's heart?

28
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,393
"Standing in the Holy of Holies,
the Great Priest, on Yom kippur,

29
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,432
"was about to pray."

30
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,233
In which direction would he pray?

31
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,279
He would turn his heart
towards the Holy Ark,

32
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,155
meaning he was looking
at the Cherubim.

33
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,557
Today we don't really remember,

34
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,479
but on the Ark of the Covenant

35
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,751
there were two angellike characters.

36
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,111
The two Cherubim,

37
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,756
standing next to the Holy Throne
of the king of kings,

38
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,917
they were made of gold,

39
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,635
and they were the recipient
of God's Presence.

40
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,433
The Great Priest
would turn his heart

41
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,836
to The Ark of Covenant.

42
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:36,479
Now let's sum up
what we've learnt today,

43
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,913
one standing in the East,
turns towards the West,

44
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,200
one in the West,
turns towards the East,

45
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,309
one in the South,
turns towards the North,

46
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,272
one in the North,
towards the South,

47
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,110
and so: all of Israel,

48
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,994
shall turn their hearts
to one place.

49
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,240
Bye bye. See you next week.
- Be well.

50
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,680
God be with you.

51
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:30,599
I didn't cut the salad yet.
Put knives and forks please.

52
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,710
David!

53
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,593
Set the table.

54
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,316
Ok.

55
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,640
How was the study today?

56
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,316
It was good. Very good.

57
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,675
What was it about?

58
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,240
We studied about praying...
Chapter 4.

59
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,760
It was interesting.

60
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,231
Not at the table, David.

61
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,000
I have to study, I have
a science exam tomorrow.

62
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,157
In what?
- Science, about water.

63
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,872
After eating we'll work on it.
- No, the teacher wiIl yell at me.

64
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,071
No one wiIl yell at you.
Don't worry.

65
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,674
She always does.

66
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,554
After lunch, Dad or me
wiIl sit with you, Ok?

67
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,591
I'm not hungry.

68
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,677
So sit with us without eating.

69
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,435
Did you wash your hands?

70
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,674
Is it Ok if Aaron comes over
for Shabbath?

71
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,676
What's that?
- I study in the meantime.

72
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,076
Now you're eating,
you'll study later.

73
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,515
But I have to know it.

74
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,360
Next Shabbath?
- What do you think?

75
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,154
Aaron is coming for Shabbath?
- I want to invite him.

76
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,714
Yes, invite him!

77
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,398
What do you say, Mom?
- Good idea.

78
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,800
Haven't seen him in a while.

79
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,436
He'll spend Shabbath with us.

80
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,673
But he won't sleep in my room.

81
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,793
Mine neither. Why mine?

82
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,555
You give your room.
- Why me?

83
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,679
You're younger,
so you'll respect the elder.

84
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,269
You're older,
so respect the Iittle one.

85
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,558
I'm older and I need privacy.
He'll sleep with you...

86
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,239
Where do you want him to sleep?

87
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,076
In your room.
- No, in yours.

88
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,157
What are you fighting about?

89
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,360
No argument! Dad wants Aaron
to sleep over, so we help.

90
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,279
You'll be in David's room,
because it's bigger.

91
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,800
Nothing to argue about.

92
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,030
Well, Ok.

93
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,834
Menachem, where are you going?

94
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,559
We haven't finished yet.

95
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,795
Menachem!
- Leave him alone.

96
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,956
Come Dad, I'm late.
- You have a girlfriend?

97
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,070
What do you mean?
They're waiting for me.

98
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,669
Just Iisten to your Mom, that's all.

99
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,198
But all my friends stay out late.

100
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,791
Yes, but they have their own parents
to worry about them.

101
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,879
Your Mom has you.
You'll respect her and Iisten.

102
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,231
I'm counting on you.
- All right.

103
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,030
Look,

104
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,240
Mom is worried.

105
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,840
You don't understand her.

106
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,594
There's nothing to worry about.
- Nothing?

107
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,640
When you come at 5 in the morning,
it's worrying.

108
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,640
So Iisten to her, and give respect.

109
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,989
You're not alone at home.

110
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,155
What can I tell you.

111
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,995
I'm telling you,
you shouldn't worry so much.

112
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,791
It's easy to say "don't worry".
When you worry, you worry...

113
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,719
Don't worry.
- Take good care.

114
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,996
It wiIl be Ok.

115
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,351
Where were you?
We've been waiting for an hour.

116
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,359
Come on, let's go.

117
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,551
How are you?
- Fine.

118
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,599
What's up?
- I'm good.

119
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,591
I don't want to.
- Come on, you always smoke.

120
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,999
Come on, smoke a bit.

121
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,918
What about you, Menachem?

122
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,520
At last.
What's going on?

123
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,632
What do gazelles do at night?
They cross their legs...

124
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,831
So you'd be with me?

125
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,759
I'll tell you later.

126
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,080
Pass me the beer.

127
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,079
Let's sing a song in Hebrew.
Something popular.

128
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,952
Maybe I could come in for a Iittle.

129
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,759
We'll wake my parents up.

130
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,633
Ok.
- Ok.

131
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,915
Me too...

132
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,360
Maybe I walk you to the door.
- No, it's fine. I'll go in. -Ok.

133
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,792
That's a bad start!
- We won't make it.

134
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,235
Why not?

135
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,914
You should wake up earlier.

136
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,999
I woke up.
- You woke up. Tell your brother.

137
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,552
Take your bag. Take it.

138
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:10,036
Why do I have to leave the house
so stressed? Tell me.

139
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,875
It's not me who was late.
- Not you?

140
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,231
It's nobody, right?
So who was it?

141
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,915
Isn't it Menachem?
- Put on your seat-belt.

142
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,558
It's not my fault at all.
- Menachem. -Sure...

143
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,433
Shut up, both of you. Ok?

144
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,712
He always wakes up late.
- That's enough.

145
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,991
He should wake up earlier next time.

146
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,118
I did.
- You did?

147
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,199
Maybe next time
you can wake up sooner.

148
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,195
Are you doing this on purpose?

149
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,273
You're so annoying.
And you know it.

150
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,994
David!
- What?

151
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,992
Watch it!
- I do.

152
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,919
I'm not doing anything. So stop.
- Cut it out, shut up.

153
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,838
I don't want to shut up.

154
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,197
I'm warning you.
You'll regret it.

155
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,630
I can't take it anymore.

156
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,434
Stop it. Don't speak.

157
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,358
I wiIl if I want.
- No you won't.

158
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,554
I can.
- You won't because it's annoying.

159
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:08,238
You do everything right?
You're such a good boy...

160
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,317
Stop it. That's enough.

161
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,951
Dad, why didn't you stop at school?

162
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,197
Dad.
- Where are you going?

163
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,800
Go get some help.

164
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,749
Get us help.

165
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,235
Get help.

166
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,433
It's here...
My Dad and my brother are here.

167
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,829
Show me what happened.

168
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,553
It's my Dad and my brother.

169
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,279
I'm Iistening.
- Here.

170
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,713
Search the car.

171
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,069
My brother's been Iike this
for a while.

172
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,237
Injury. Order an ambulance.

173
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:14,236
Search unit here. Send ambulance.
I've got an 8 year-old boy hurt.

174
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,120
My Dad was here
and he's not here anymore.

175
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,552
He was driving?
- I don't know where he is.

176
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,195
When you left the car your Dad
was all right?

177
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,913
He had his seat belt on?

178
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,158
Did he get a knock in the face?

179
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:33,311
No, he talked to me,
he told me to get help.

180
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,750
I see.
How did the accident happen?

181
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,395
I don't know where he is.
- Don't worry about your Dad.

182
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:44,309
Did he go off lane?
Was he tired, asleep?

183
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,909
Hey, Iittle one.
Everything's Ok.

184
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,515
Suddenly...
- You don't remember?

185
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:54,237
Don't move, I'll put a collar on,
to protect you neck. Does it hurt?

186
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,591
...he went off the road.

187
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,995
Your head?

188
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,953
We'll put you on a stretcher, Ok?
We'll take you to the hospital.

189
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,673
WiIl he be Ok?
- He'll be fine. -Holding?

190
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,791
They'll take him for a check.

191
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,720
Are you with us?
Don't worry about your Dad.

192
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:20,914
We'll get some back up.
We're the first rescue team,

193
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,350
we'll take care of it, Ok?

194
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,590
It looks fine.

195
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,111
Don't worry.
More police are on their way.

196
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,316
Check him,
he said he was dizzy.

197
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,313
We have an accident here.

198
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,592
Are there people hurt?
- Yes.

199
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,955
On our way. Over.
- Two injured.

200
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,677
Please report.

201
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,590
One missing person,
I don't know if he's hurt.

202
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,951
Bring forces for search.

203
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,510
On our way. Report.

204
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:56,435
Tall. Gray hair.
In his forties.

205
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,957
His son claims he may have suffered
a blow to the head.

206
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,510
More police are on their way to you.

207
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,558
Ok, I'll be waiting here.

208
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,556
Over.

209
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,353
Check the car. See what's going on.

210
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,997
They claim
that the driver is missing.

211
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,278
...he was fine,
he just told me to call for help.

212
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,838
You left, and when you came back,
you saw he was missing.

213
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,110
Exactly.

214
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,029
And there was nothing left of him?
His bag, his phone?

215
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,037
Nothing.
- He just disappeared?

216
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,072
Disappeared.
- I see.

217
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,795
The papers from yesterday.
- Thank you.

218
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,918
Two Iightly injured
were taken to the hospital.

219
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,636
And the driver is missing.
Here's the description:

220
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:11,155
He's wearing a black shirt,
underneath, a gray shirt.

221
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,351
Average height.

222
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,672
40 years old.
We'll search this area.

223
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,720
I have to go back to Tel Aviv,

224
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,915
and I want us to talk a Iittle
and see what's going on.

225
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,829
Good night.

226
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,880
Good night, Grandma.

227
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,513
In the area of the car.
From here, circular search.

228
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,952
Second group, good.
Stay in touch with me.

229
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,640
Around the rocks there.
20 yards up North.

230
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,355
Are you Ok?

231
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,152
Don't you want to rest a Iittle?

232
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,480
It wiIl be fine.

233
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,199
Eli, Eli!

234
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,440
Eli Frankel!

235
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:24,757
Spread! Take it to the left.

236
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:34,079
Everything looks fine, but let's
make sure it all functions well.

237
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,595
Hands in front, close your eyes.

238
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,996
Right hand finger to your nose.

239
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,273
Great. Second hand now please.

240
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,876
Beautiful. Let me see you.

241
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,517
Eli! Eli!

242
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,713
Eli Frankel!

243
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,919
I'd Iike to read this chapter
for my son.

244
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:23,670
May his merits save him
so he comes home in peace.

245
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,432
This Magnificent Prayer
of king David,

246
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,910
who was in the cave,
escaping his oppressors.

247
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,720
He would say:

248
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,917
Where shall I turn,
Where shall I escape.

249
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,513
I can only turn to You.

250
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,439
A Contemplation of David.

251
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,634
A prayer when he was in a cave.

252
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,839
I cry out to God with my voice;

253
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,072
with my voice to God
I make my supplication.

254
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,233
I pour out my complaint before Him;

255
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,393
I declare before Him my trouble.

256
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,714
When my spirit was overwhelmed
within me,

257
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,514
then You knew my path.
In the way where I walk,

258
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,153
have they privily laid a snare
for me.

259
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,312
Look on my right, and see,

260
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:23,030
no man recognized me,
refuge failed me;

261
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:27,712
no man cared for my soul.
I cried unto You, O God

262
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:33,359
You are my refuge and my portion
in the land of the Iiving.

263
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,713
Attend unto my cry;

264
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,156
for I am brought very low,

265
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:42,996
deliver me from my persecutors;
for they are stronger than I.

266
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,352
Bring my soul out of prison,

267
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,557
that I may praise Your Name,

268
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,956
the righteous shall
compass me about;

269
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,710
for You shall deal bountifully
with me.

270
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,393
I have to tell you
what the Jewish Law says,

271
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:36,959
although we don't know where he is,
we are sure he is stiIl alive.

272
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,072
Meaning there is no mourning.

273
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,793
We don't grieve,

274
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,310
we don't say the prayer
for the dead, God forbid.

275
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:48,509
This is very far from our heart,
we assume he is stiIl alive.

276
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,236
You shouldn't deal
with these aspects.

277
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,869
I think there is an opportunity
here as a family.

278
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,192
For each one of you
and together.

279
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:07,200
As long as Eli isn't here,
we have to think of one another.

280
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,429
There's one thing that is important,

281
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:14,389
that I would add: I know you pray,

282
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,997
and each one of you can pray,
but I would also suggest

283
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,476
it's very important to give Charity.

284
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:25,552
Charity means that
I don't hold on to all I've got,

285
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,319
all the blessing that's been
given to me,

286
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,512
but I must let it flow out
to the world.

287
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,637
When God sees this,

288
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:37,033
He organizes the world
to help the one who gives.

289
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,833
Did you get any news?

290
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,596
Nothing.

291
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,352
Why don't you come to school?

292
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,399
I don't want to talk to people.

293
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,114
Does your Mom know?
- It doesn't matter.

294
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,914
It wiIl be Ok, don't worry.

295
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,516
Yes.

296
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,634
I'm here, really.

297
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,234
It's gonna be all right.

298
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,000
I need to go back soon.

299
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,595
Ok, go. It's fine.

300
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,793
I need to go.
- You want me to come with you?

301
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,793
No, they're coming soon.

302
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,516
I'll always be here for you.

303
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,670
Bye, Menachem.

304
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,712
Deliver me from my persecutors;

305
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,559
for they are stronger than I.

306
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,832
Bring my soul out of prison,

307
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,077
that I may praise Your name,

308
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,396
the righteous shall
compass me about;

309
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,639
for You shall deal
bountifully with me.

310
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,878
Let's go, it's time.

311
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,438
Thank you for coming.
It's very kind.

312
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,992
What else can we do?
- Thank you.

313
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,872
I don't want to play,
I'm tired.

314
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:23,431
Alma, Menachem, we're going.

315
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,595
I appreciate your presence,

316
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:35,600
please keep praying,
and keep thinking of Eli,

317
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,831
so he comes back in peace.

318
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,033
Goodbye.

319
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,918
Alma. Alma!

320
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,872
I want to thank you
for what you did,

321
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,390
letting all the people
come and pray.

322
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,839

a close family,

323
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:04,040
you've had your ways, l've had mine.

324
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,992
But these are hard times

325
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,920
and we need to help each other.

326
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,479
l want this house to be
a place of prayer.

327
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:18,152
That more and more people come
until Eli comes back.

328
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,116
All right?

329
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,320
Good night.

330
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,240
Thank you Alma.

331
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,632

00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,875
One second.

349
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,037
Can you take this with you?

350
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,600
Come, please.

351
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,631
She asks
if the boy can stay outside.

352
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:18,154
Good morning. Alma Frankel.
- lnspector kaufman.

353
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,880
You asked to come with the children,

354
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,198
but could the little one
stay outside?

355
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,877
That's fine. How are you?

356
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,195
All right.
- Good.

357
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,596
Wait for me here.
- keep an eye on him.

358
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,756
But l want to listen.

359
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,952
l'll tell you everything afterwards,
please sit here.

360
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,356
Mom will come soon.
Follow me.

361
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,475
Sit down, please.

362
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:48,031
l've asked you to come
to tell you exactly what's going on.

363
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:53,271
The investigation is at a point
where we're completely at a loss.

364
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,752
We don't know anything.

365
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:00,397
We don't know if he's in the country
and if he is, whether he's hiding,

366
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,433
if he's under a false identity,
if he's hurt,

367
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:08,914
if he's been killed.
We don't know anything.

368
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:14,237
l'm sorry for what you're going
through, but that's the situation.

369
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:28,399
The thing is that our bank account
has been frozen,

370
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:32,992
and it's hard
to sustain ourselves without it.

371
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,958
l don't know how long
we're going to last,

372
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,596
and l don't know
who can help me with that.

373
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,197
What happens now
is that in a few days,

374
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:46,559
if we have no results, we transfer
the case to the lntelligence Office,

375
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,396
and they should issue
a Missing Person Certificate.

376
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,200
With this, you can turn
to the authorities,

377
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:58,196
Court, Social Security,
and they'll take care of you.

378
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,352
l'm sorry for
what you're going through,

379
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:04,439
it's inherent to this case,

380
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:08,919
which is unusual and may take years.

381
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,269
We'll contact you once in a while,

382
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:17,196
for more information
concerning the investigation.

383
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,718
l'm very sorry. Stay strong.

384
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,996
Thank you.

385
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,276
Come, David.

386
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,310
"... people outside the castle.

387
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,955
"'They're so poor', he thought."

388
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,156
Hello, Alma.
- Hello, Shmuel.

389
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,111
Take that, please.
- Hi, Alma.

390
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,514
We brought some drinks.

391
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,589
Thanks a lot.
- No problem.

392
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,754
For the guests.

393
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,519
l'll make space for it.

394
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,797
Yes, put it there.
Sparkling and some not sparkling.

395
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:35,199
Maybe later we go to the bakery,
to get more things.

396
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,640
We don't need much.

397
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,680
ls there enough food?

398
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,435
Some.

399
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,518
For the guests. lt's important.

400
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,877
Hello, sweetheart.
- Hello, Aaron.

401
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,750
How do you feel?

402
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,678
Hurts a bit, but l'm better.

403
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,713
Go to bed, you're not well.
- l'll go soon.

404
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,357
Go to bed, your head isn't Ok yet.

405
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,630
Aaron, l'm sorry,

406
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:06,750
l've asked Menachem to call you
and tell you not to come today.

407
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:11,591
l'm exhausted, and l need calm.
Our day was a nightmare.

408
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,390
lt's Ok, you can rest,
we'll do everything.

409
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,836
Yes, it's Ok, we'll handle it.

410
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:21,910
No, l need my home back. There were
too many people in these last days.

411
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,236
l need to settle down.
Some silence.

412
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,711
lt's important that people come,
and for us to be here.

413
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:32,594
l really need to be by myself.
lt has nothing to do with you.

414
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,315
They came to help.
- lt doesn't help me.

415
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,671
lt's important.
- Aaron!

416
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,718
Let's go, we're not welcome here.

417
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,797
No, l'm just exhausted.

418
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,071
No, no. We're not welcome.
Come.

419
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,310
Come, Aaron!

420
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:50,640
l'm just so tired, l need peace.
- Aaron, don't go.

421
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:54,231
One second. Sit down, it's Ok.
- Grandpa.

422
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:58,149
She needs to be alone, l understand.
- Father, sit!

423
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,350
Why do that?

424
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,398
Why don't you stay?
- Bye, kids.

425
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:04,797
Grandpa, it's Ok.
She'll rest and we'll be here.

426
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,115
Come, come!

427
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,590
Aaron. Stay.

428
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,313
Pray so that your Dad comes back.

429
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,709
Don't go.

430
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,278
Tell them to come back now.

431
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,359
No, l asked you to call them.
- What you're doing is wrong.

432
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:23,030
You're wrong. l asked you
to tell them not to come.

433
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:26,471
They're our family, it helps me
that they're here.

434
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,876
lt doesn't help me.
- l'm going to call them.

435
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,030
Grandpa.

436
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,875
Wait... You can come back.
- Go home.

437
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:55,160
You can come, really.
- He'll calm down.

438
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,794
She's just tired.

439
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:01,153
l understand. Don't worry.
l'll talk to him, he'll calm down.

440
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,596
We'll talk over the phone.

441
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,796
Bye. Go back up, everything's Ok.

442
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,796
Father!

443
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,714
Stop it!

444
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,279
Get out of my room!

445
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,720
Stop!

446
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,478
Stop looking at me!

447
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,838
Mommy! Mommy!

448
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,595
Come, Mom!

449
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,477
Get out!
- What is it?

450
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:41,629
l can't breath. Stop! Get out of here!
- David! What's going on?

451
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,638
Mommy, come!
- What is it?

452
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,471
Tell me what's going on.

453
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:50,037
David, l'm here.
- Menachem. Leave him alone, please.

454
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,436
What's with him?
- He had a nightmare.

455
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,236
Come here.
Here baby, that's it.

456
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,556
ls he Ok?
- Yes.

457
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,880
Go back to bed.

458
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,078
That's it, breathe...

459
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:11,998
l'm here, everything is all right.

460
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,959
So, how much did he earn?

461
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:34,158
l think around 6000,
before overtime.

462
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,757
And these are all his pay slips?

463
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,509
Two years back, l think.

464
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,713
Look, it's quite a mess, but...

465
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:49,471
l think it will be all right.
We need to plan a budget

466
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,069
that you don't budge from,
because...

467
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,793
Good morning.

468
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:58,912
There are payments accumulating,
that will be charged soon.

469
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:02,278
So you need to be very careful.

470
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,350
Do you have savings? An insurance?

471
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,192
Not that l know of.

472
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:13,998
Eli was taking care
of our savings and all the bills.

473
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,197
lt's all in this account
that is frozen.

474
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,710
The apartment, in whose name?
- Both of us.

475
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,240
Good morning.
- Good morning.

476
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,800
You made sandwiches?
- No.

477
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,639
Make some for the both of you.

478
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,797
So give me money, l'll buy some.

479
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,550
No, take a second.
Go to the kitchen, be responsible.

480
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,514
There's fresh bread and fruits.
- Good morning.

481
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,996
Where is the bread?
- On the counter.

482
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,557
Hurry up, you're late.

483
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,310
Go to the kitchen,
he'll give you milk.

484
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,709
ln a second.

485
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,270
Pour him some milk.
- Come, David.

486
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,473
Let's drink something.

487
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,911
Are you worried?
- Yes, very much. -Don't worry.

488
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,950
Why did they freeze this account?

489
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,470
lt's our money,
why can't l withdraw from it?

490
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,075
lt seems
that you're not authorized.

491
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,520
You want cheese in it?

492
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,595
lt's for school.
- Bring your bag.

493
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,189
lt'll be fine.
We'll arrange everything.

494
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,517
Menachem, hurry up, you're late.

495
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,797
You think Social Security can...

496
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:20,391
Social security is a good idea,
but we'll do it through the lawyer.

497
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:26,113
l think we can refer to you
as a single mother, right?

498
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,835
Just for the lawyer,
so he presents it like that to them.

499
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,395
l don't know, but...

500
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,594
Take him up to the gate, Ok?
- Fine.

501
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,350
Hello.

502
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,233
Hey, Menachem, how are you?

503
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,794
What's up?
- Hello, Yossi.

504
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,913
Any news from your father?
- No. ls Grandpa here?

505
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,190
He's studying.

506
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,630
Are you Ok?

507
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,434
Can l talk to you?

508
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,758
One sec, let me finish
and l'll be with you.

509
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,829
One more thing about the picture,
it can stay like this,

510
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,431
but they need it urgently
for tomorrow morning

511
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,950
to see it and then have a print.

512
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:00,796
Are they stressed about it?
- Very, they need it tomorrow.

513
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:05,831
So we move the phone number
to here and erase this part.

514
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,872
Fine, l'll do it.

515
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,710
Great. l'm going to the machine.
- Thanks.

516
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,876
Sit down.

517
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,916

00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:51,276
... that's the situation.

694
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:56,555
Mom, these talks don't help,
l have practical problems.

695
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:58,235
How are you, kid?

696
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:01,595
Hi, Grandma.
- Good to see you.

697
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:07,029
Happy to see you. How are you?
- Good.

698
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:09,152
How's school?
- Good.

699
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:14,396
Alma, be with me.
Pull yourself together.

700
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,037
Tell me that you understand,

701
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:21,040
so that we can move on.

702
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:26,355
We're a family and we'll face it
together, you're not alone.

703
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,791
You hear me?

704
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:33,030
Please, for yourself,

705
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:38,116
for the kids, for me, l can't
see you like this, l'm your mother.

706
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:41,870
l need your help.
- Fine, fine. You have it.

707
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:45,437
You have my help in every way.

708
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:49,389
lf we need legal advice,
whatever we need.

709
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:52,160
What matters is that
you find yourself again,

710
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:53,794
you're the key.

711
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:55,798
l'll be fine again.

712
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:57,839
Alma, be with me.

713
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:02,439
Be with me. And understand
what l'm telling you.

714
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,876
l know it's hard, l was there too.

715
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:08,112
Each situation is different.
But l know what means to be alone.

716
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:00,155
Spread some egg here.

717
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:04,870
Don't disturb her.

718
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:06,958
l don't. Do l?

719
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:09,357
No. He's helping me, Menachem.

720
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:26,832
Open the oven's door.

721
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:59,195
The sixth day,

722
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:02,000
all the heavens and earth
were completed.

723
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:05,676
And God finished His Work
on the seventh day.

724
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:08,474
And rested on the seventh day
after all He had done.

725
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:11,718
And God blessed and sanctified
that day, for on it He rested

726
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:15,038
after all His work which
God created to function.

727
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,271
Together.
- To life.

728
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:20,792
Blessed are You, king of the
universe, for the fruit of the vine.

729
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:24,636
Blessed are You, who has sanctified
us with His commandments,

730
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:27,150
and has given us,
His holy Shabbath as a heritage,

731
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:31,513
in remembrance of Creation, of
the first Holy Day, of the Exodus.

732
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:34,155
For You have sanctified
and chosen us from all people.

733
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:37,557
And Your Holy Shabbath given us
with love and good will.

734
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:40,115
Blessed are You,
who sanctifies the Shabbath.

735
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:41,356
Amen.

736
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:01,154
Blessed are You God,
who brings bread from the earth.

737
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:02,316
Amen.

738
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:26,359
Good Shabbath.
- Good Shabbath.

739
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:12,591
Sorry, l'm a little tired.
l'll be in my room.

740
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,080
Good night.

741
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:52,989
Have a good meal.
- You too.

742
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:01,319
Get up, you said we'd wake up early.

743
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:02,436
ln a bit.

744
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:04,353
Get up!
- Soon.

745
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:06,312
Enough sleeping.

746
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:08,997
Just a little more.

747
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:10,994
Get up already.

748
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:17,674
Stop. Just five minutes...

749
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:40,630
Why didn't you wake me up earlier?
- l did.

750
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:48,879
Hurry up.
- Hold on, you're going too fast.

751
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:56,516
Come. Move it!

752
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:58,319
l am, but you're quick.

753
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:00,190
lt's hard.

754
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:52,356
Good Shabbath father.

755
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:55,316
You ate well?
- What a surprise!

756
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:59,589
What are you doing here? lt's great.
So good you came!

757
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:03,230
Good Shabbath.

758
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:06,039
We were waiting for you.

759
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:07,914
Bring the books.

760
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:13,440
Open the weekly Torah portion.

761
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:25,480
Did it take long to come?
- A long hour.

762
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:27,717
Not much.
- A long hour?

763
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:29,795
A long hour...

764
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:39,560
Have you found it?

765
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:05,230
"And God spoke to Moses, saying,

766
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:08,910
"Speak to Aaron and say to him,
When you light the lamps,

767
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:12,556
"the seven lamps shall give light
over against the candlestick.

768
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:16,356
"And Aaron did so;
he lighted the lamps

769
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:20,156
"over against the candlestick,
as God commanded Moses.

770
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:22,751
"And this work of the candlestick

771
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:27,909
"was of beaten gold, unto the shaft,
unto the flowers,

772
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:29,759
"was beaten work,

773
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:32,196
"according to the pattern
which God had showed Moses,

774
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:34,312
"so he made the candlestick."

775
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:37,800
You understood?

776
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:44,278
Well. When it says:
"Shaft, unto the flower",

777
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:47,711
what does "Shaft, unto the flower"
mean?

778
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:52,360
Shaft, down, flower, up.

779
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:55,911
One piece.
The candlestick was made

780
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:59,192
of one big piece of gold.

781
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:00,276
And Grandpa?

782
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:03,074
Was the candlestick big?
- Very big.

783
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:05,391
How many branches to it?
- Seven.

784
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:08,558
Seven, right.
What else is seven?

785
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:10,399
Days.
- Right.

786
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,314
What's the seventh day?

787
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:13,994
Shabbath.

788
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:16,912
These seven days

789
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:20,878
stand for continuity,

790
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:24,918
for a whole. Seven days,

791
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:29,159
then another seven, then, Aaron...

792
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:32,189
Seven days, and so on.

793
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:36,196
Eternity. That's Eternity.

794
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:38,114
And Grandpa?

795
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:40,038
Will Eternity ever stop?

796
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:42,350
No.

797
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:00,079
What do you think?

798
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:02,759
About what?

799
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:04,680
Me.

800
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:08,200
You what?

801
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:10,636
What do you think about me?

802

803
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:15,394
Love me?

804
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:17,720

01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:23,039
l love you too.
- Really?

806
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:25,436
Yes.

807
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:55,799
Love me?

808
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:57,670
Love.

809
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:03,240
Menachem, wake up! Why didn't you
tell your Mom you were here?

810
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:05,556
She's very upset. Come, let's go.

811
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:06,875
Ok.
- Come now.

812
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,320
Ok, fine.

813
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:12,356
Father, have a good week,
we have to run.

814
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:16,272
Hold on.
Let me say goodbye properly.

815
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,435
May God bless you, and keep you.

816
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:22,155
Make His face light you,
and delight you.

817
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:25,514
May God be present upon you
and give you peace.

818
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:28,917
Come. Come.
- Goodbye.

819
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:53,199
Bye bye.
- Bye.

820
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:08,115
Have a good week.

821
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:09,270
Good week, Aaron.

822
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:12,080
You too.
Easy with your mother.

823
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:14,399
All right.

824
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:16,358
Bye, you're welcome.

825
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:19,639
Have a good week.
- Good week.

826
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:50,439
Menachem, l want to talk to you.

827
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:52,189
David, go to sleep.

828
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:54,239
Wait, let me get something to eat.

829

831
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,152
lt's the last time
you take David without telling me.

832
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:08,715
Mom, l'm sorry.
- l was so worried.

833
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:11,196
l apologize.
- l don't need your apology.

834
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:13,439
Sorry, l should have told you.

835
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:15,552
Tell me it's the last time.

836
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:19,640
Ok, l apologized. Good night.

Give me two minutes of your time.
Sit down.

01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:36,959
lt can't go on like this.

840
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:40,033
l know it's hard for you.

841
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:43,671
For me too. For David too.

842
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:47,919
But you're not alone.

843
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:50,840

844
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:53,911
And l'm not going anywhere.

845
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:55,400
Fine.

846
01:12:57,640 --> 01:12:58,756
Yes.

847
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:01,751
And l miss him too.

Good night, Mom.
- Come here.

852
01:13:58,440 --> 01:14:00,557
Ready?
- Just a minute.

853
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:09,910
l'm afraid Mom will wake up.
- She won't. Don't bring the bag.

854
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:12,631
lf not, she'll find out.

855
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:16,675
She'll think l went to school.
- All right.

856
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:19,320
Pass me the sweatshirt.

857
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:28,795
Sure about this?

858
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:31,835
Come, then.

859
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:13,193
l need you focused.
And stay with me all the time.

860
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:30,160
Good morning, Aaron.

861
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:32,039
Morning. How are you?

862
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:34,800
Can we see the books?
- Are they ready?

863
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:36,991
They are, but what about school?

864
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:39,430
We just wanted to see the books...

865
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:42,031
We came to see them.

866
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:45,676
Why not after school?
Can't you come after school?

867
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:48,719
We just wanted to see them,
then we go.

868
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:50,160
You'll get me in trouble
with your Mom?

869
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:53,318
No, it's fine. Really.

870
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:58,556
Ok, look at the books
and run to school.

871
01:15:58,680 --> 01:16:00,478
And while you're there,

872
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:05,675
put in some requests for prayer,
they're next to the books,

873
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:09,231
put them inside the Tehilim books.
- No problem.

874
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:12,795
Quick!

875
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:15,154
Then to school!

876
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:47,199
Sit!

877
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:51,555
"Repentance, Prayer, and Charity",
remember that.

878
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:54,560
We take these books
and give them to people.

879
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:57,320
We have to put in
the requests and the money.

880
01:16:57,720 --> 01:17:00,315
We give them
so they can pray for Dad,

881
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:03,359
they'll give the money for Charity
in his name, got it?

882
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:04,920
You understand?
- Yes.

883
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:07,396
So go. Put it in...

Sit!
- l want to go home.

885
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:12,277
Sit!
- You yell at me all the time.

886
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:14,750
l think we're doing bad things.

887
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:18,237
lf we're doing something good,
why are you always mad at me?

888
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:21,511
When you're angry, l feel sad.

889
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:26,711
l want to go home, l'm scared.
- But l'm not angry.

890
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:29,276
Why do you give me orders
all the time?

891
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:33,599
Because l want to do this.
l'm sorry, l'm not angry at you.

892
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:35,240
You understand?

893
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:37,834
l... sit down.

894
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,550
l'm sorry if you think l'm mad,
because l'm not.

895
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:45,317

896
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:46,956

01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:50,079
lt's the most important thing
we can do for him.

898
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:52,434
Will you help me?

899
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:54,394
Really?

900
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:58,671
So we're good brothers?

You'll help me?
- Yes.

902

So, take this.

Put the papers inside.

904
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:08,716
Ok? You understand?

905
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:17,232

Hi, Grandpa.

Aaron!

935

You have more books?
- Where were you?

936
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:59,034
No, tell me where you were?
l'd like to know.

937
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:01,590
Why are you so happy?
l've been waiting for you.

938
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:04,591
Why are you waiting, we...

939
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:07,635
Go on, say it, where were you?
l was worried.

940
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:09,911
What? Where are the books?

941
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:13,834
We took them.
- We gave them.

942
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:15,599
To whom?
- To people.

943
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:17,313
We gave them.
- You gave the books.

944
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:19,591
We distributed them.
- You distributed them?

945
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:21,513
Did l ask you to give the books?

946
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:24,519
l asked you to put the notes in,
not to give them out.

947
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:27,109
Hold it, l want to understand,

948
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:28,920
what exactly did you do?

949
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:31,037
They gave the books,
don't you understand?

950
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:33,311
To whom did they give them?

951
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:38,871
Answer me.
To whom did you give the books?

952
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:42,511
We handed them out on the street.
- What did you do?

953
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:46,074
You gave them?
- We also put money. -David!

954
01:21:48,680 --> 01:21:50,911
We also put money inside.
- What?

955
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:54,153
What did you do?
- What?

956
01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:56,033
We put money inside.
- What money?

957
01:21:56,160 --> 01:21:59,358
Which? Where from?
- Which money, Menachem?

958
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:06,795
Mom has a box with plenty of money
so he took a little.

959
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:09,674
Did Mom give you money?

960
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:12,275
Did she, Menachem?
- You are not going.

961
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:14,835
Mom didn't exactly...
l wanted to do good.

962
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:18,397
What "not exactly"?
- You took it without permission?

963
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:19,954
What did you do?

964
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:24,240
We gave books so people
could be charitable in Dad's name.

965
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:29,434
To people in the street, like that?
- lt's not like that.

966
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:32,519
Do you realize
you gave sacred books,

967
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:37,590
with the name of God,
to people in the street.

968
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:40,958
Who knows what they'll do?
They might throw it in the trash!

969
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:42,560
Where did you take that money?

970
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:47,751
lt was for Repentance and Charity.
- No, no. What Charity?

971
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:51,237
lt was meant to be given
to your father's community.

972
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:54,159
Do you understand
you stole a good action?

973
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:55,390
l was trying to do good.

974
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:59,150
You're not going anywhere.
You're going to explain it to me...

975
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:00,959
Do you know what you did?

976
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:04,352
l was trying to do good.
- Stop him.

977
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:08,156
We were doing good things.
- Stay here, l'll call your mother.

978
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:12,996
Hold on, l want to talk to you.
Hold it, where are you going?

979
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:16,000
Come, there are 150 books left.
We'll give them properly.

980
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:17,520
l did it for you too.

981
01:23:17,640 --> 01:23:20,917
l understand. You made a mistake.
50 books are gone. lt's done.

982
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:24,795
Come, there are more books...
- Go, go.

983
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:26,991
l won't. You come too.
- Leave me alone.

984
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:30,670
l want you to come too.
Where are you going now?

985
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:21,153
Yes? Who are you?

986
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:23,551
l'm Menachem.
- Menachem what?

987
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:25,792
Frankel.
You're Debbie's father?

988
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:30,239
Yes, l'm Debbie's father. l heard
that it's over between you two.

989
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:31,754
You shouldn't be here.

990
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:33,872
Can you call her?
- Absolutely not.

991
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:36,032
Just to tell her something.
- No way.

992
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:38,590
l just want to tell her something.
To talk.

993
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:40,200
No, she's suffered enough.

994
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:43,353
lt won't take long.
To say one thing.

995
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:45,989
l refuse.
- Please let me talk to her.

996
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:48,794
No, it's hard enough for her now.

997
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:50,792
l just want to tell her one thing.

998
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:53,389
No way!
- lt won't take much time.

999
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:56,558
You shouldn't...
- l just want to tell her...

1000
01:24:56,680 --> 01:24:58,797
Don't ever come back again!

1001
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:52,270
Mom.

1002
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:03,635
Mom.

1003
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:08,394
l'm sorry.

1004
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:16,910
l'm sorry.

Excuse me.

1007
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:21,320
Look,

1008
01:30:22,040 --> 01:30:26,000
this is the report, and the Missing
Person Certificate of your husband.

1009
01:30:26,360 --> 01:30:30,673
With these you can turn to Court,
to the Ministry, whatever you need.

1010
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:35,477
Please keep them safe,
they're very hard to obtain.

1011
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:40,709
Now, if you have any question,
you can call this number.

1012
01:30:42,640 --> 01:30:46,520
And of course, if there is
any new information. All right?

1013
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:48,715
Goodbye.

1014
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:49,200
You want some?

01:31:50,120 --> 01:31:51,349
You?
