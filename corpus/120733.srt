1
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,807
Will you marry me?

2
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:32,040
What?

3
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:34,362
Don't you want to?

4
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,319
I don't know.

5
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,448
I mean,
I can't say right now.

6
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,844
-Are you sure?
-Yes... aren't we?

7
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:49,205
It's just that, Jorge you can't
do that out of the blue!

8
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,767
You're right.
I don't know what I was...

9
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:54,404
I...

10
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,368
Carry on reading.

11
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:02,001
I will, this book's a best-seller.
It's really good.

12
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,765
I know, once you've started
you can't stop.

13
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,727
How about the mall on Saturday?
I asked Miguel for the car.

14
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:12,360
You could think over
the marriage thing.

15
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:15,240
OK, we could eat there

16
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:18,163
and spend the afternoon
in the shopping center.

17
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:28,647
FOOTBALL DAYS

18
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:33,326
When I started therapy here
I felt a bit strange.

19
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,399
This has completely changed me.

20
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:40,967
Now I feel I am a completely
new man and that...

21
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:44,924
Well, I've evolved.

22
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:46,569
Right, M Carmen?

23
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,279
And I feel I can face anything.

24
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:51,849
I control my impulses,

25
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:53,959
and...

26
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,402
Can I go to the ward?

27
00:01:58,010 --> 00:01:59,284
I am talking.

28
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,002
I am talking, M Carmen.

29
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:04,721
I'm about to get the shakes.

30
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,802
I said I'm talking.

31
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,326
Breathe Antonio. You were doing
so well. Come on, breathe.

32
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:16,167
Can you see the light?
That's it. Can you see the light?

33
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:20,406
Tough shit!

34
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:25,045
M Carmen,
this ruins the therapy.

35
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,245
OK.

36
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,129
Yeah. Sorry.

37
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:39,087
Don't turn the pages so quickly.
I'm getting cold.

38
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:41,125
Ramón...

39
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:43,688
I'm pregnant.

40
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,803
<i>Welcome to the</i>
<i>"Oasis of Pleasure."</i>

41
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:12,683
<i>Plunge into the world</i>
<i>of wild sex and lust, with...</i>

42
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,528
Meatball, lunch is ready!

43
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:19,921
Study subject six,
I know it's going to come up.

44
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:22,479
No, for sure.
Talk to you later.

45
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:27,205
Coming, mum! I'm starving.
Be there in a minute!

46
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,319
Look!

47
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:35,562
That's me.

48
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:39,159
In my early days.

49
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,719
Did I tell you?
Next month I'm doing a movie!

50
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,721
Don't groan so loudly.

51
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:52,925
No, Pablo!

52
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:56,480
I want the Figo T-shirt!
I want the Figo T-shirt!

53
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:00,325
Hurry up, I've got to go
and get your uncle.

54
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,924
Great, so I'm the witch
and you're Father Christmas.

55
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,479
-No T-shirt, OK?
-No, sweetie, it's not...

56
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:10,041
Don't call me sweetie! And stop
staring at everyone’s tits!

57
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:12,121
Dad was staring at her tits!

58
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,689
No I wasn't!

59
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:16,208
We have a moral obligation

60
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:18,440
with Antonio. Otherwise...

61
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:22,049
We have to be there for him.
There he is!

62
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:24,559
Hey!

63
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:26,044
Antonio!

64
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:27,639
Jesus.

65
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:32,002
How's it going?

66
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,244
Are you out of your head?

67
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:37,122
Move, he'll kill the guy!

68
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:38,925
I apologize.

69
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,000
Please forgive me.

70
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,842
It was my fault.

71
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:57,599
"You talking to me?"

72
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,243
"You talking to me?"

73
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,279
Wow!

74
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:05,405
Yes sir!

75
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,801
-It gets better each time.
-I was nervous.

76
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:11,759
He even screwed the blonde
in the commercials with him!

77
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:14,967
No need for such detail.
Well yeah, I did screw her.

78
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,562
And he got a part in a movie.

79
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,405
-Change the subject.
-What movie is that?

80
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,481
-Well it's about...
-Antonio,

81
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:26,245
-we've got a job for you.
-I've made some arrangements.

82
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,321
You're coming on a bit heavy!

83
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:31,880
Jorge, I told you I didn't want
to talk about it like this.

84
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,120
It's a serious subject.

85
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:36,639
Look...

86
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:40,004
I've got my own project.

87
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:41,649
Your own project?

88
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,644
Yes, my own project.

89
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:47,920
I'm going to study psychology.

90
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,725
Psychology's
an interesting science.

91
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:57,839
Very interesting
and very necessary.

92
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:00,006
Look, you have to understand

93
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:03,560
that people suffer a lot
and they need help.

94
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:06,006
And since I'm a good listener...

95
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:09,799
I'll make a great psychologist
because that's what they do.

96
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,239
And give advice.

97
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:15,163
-You'll have to hold down a job.
-I know, Jorge.

98
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:20,167
The thing is I'm not going to study
like a seven-year degree thing.

99
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:22,446
I'm going to go it alone.

100
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,004
I'll do a correspondence course

101
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:28,129
and a few sessions on the side.
I don't need that university shit.

102
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:30,042
It's just one easy exam.

103
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:31,802
University's crap.

104
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:36,361
You know why I failed? I was
fucking his wife the whole time!

105
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,248
What was that
about my sister?

106
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:44,760
Let's order some prawns.
Evaristo!

107
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:46,568
Repeat what you said.

108
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:47,321
Antonio, please...

109
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,718
-Let it go.
-Shut up!

110
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:52,599
Look me in the eye and repeat
what you said about my sister!

111
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:00,885
You talking to me?

112
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:06,363
You talking to me?

113
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,363
It's the same old joke.

114
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,646
Patricia is a bit of a slut.

115
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:20,650
But Violeta's different.
How are things between you?

116
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:22,448
Watch what you say about my wife.

117
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,170
We'll say whatever
we fucking like about her.

118
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:28,083
We've all fucked her.
Him, him, him and all of us.

119
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,639
She only kissed Gonzalo,
and she was drunk.

120
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:33,563
-I touched her tits under the bra.
-You said it was over the bra.

121
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:35,800
I got nipple contact.

122
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,926
There you are.
Why do I bother?

123
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:40,321
Shit, I haven't
half missed you all.

124
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:45,244
Let's have a family photo.
That's it.

125
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:46,804
And another...

126
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,688
You'll use up all the film.

127
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:50,918
I don't know.

128
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:53,043
Oh, Antonio!

129
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,365
Pablito!

130
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,121
Come here,
I've got a present for you.

131
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:01,603
-So what should I do?
-Well just say no.

132
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:02,919
But I love him.

133
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:05,843
Jorge's a pain.
Always getting the shits.

134
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:08,240
-He was your boyfriend.
-Don't remind me.

135
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:11,846
Be smart, find yourself
a handsome, fun boyfriend.

136
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:14,888
I have a great time with Jorge.
And he's very handsome.

137
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,688
-He is not.
-Yes, he is.

138
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:18,283
He's got nice hair.

139
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:21,362
But look at those legs
and that fat belly.

140
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:22,645
It's a shame.

141
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:25,404
Miguel's certainly ugly.
Look at him.

142
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:28,443
He looks retarded
taking pictures of trees.

143
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:29,804
Ugly, boring

144
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:33,406
and completely retarded,
but Jorge...

145
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,208
-Well I love him.
-How could you?

146
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:36,485
I love him!

147
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,561
-How come you're so pale?
-I'm not!

148
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:40,641
-Are you eating alright?
-Just drop it!

149
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:41,965
Shit!

150
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:44,325
OK...

151
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,800
There's this guy at work

152
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:52,325
-and he's asked me out a few times.
-Have you fucked him?

153
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:53,839
No!

154
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:55,485
So?

155
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:58,244
Well, he gave me a kiss,
but no tongues.

156
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:01,959
No tongues? Are you 13 years old
or have you gone completely stupid?

157
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:04,360
Mum, look what Antonio's

158
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:05,804
given me!

159
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,602
As clumsy as his father.

160
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:12,045
Shit, Patricia, that's your son.

161
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:14,804
Keep an eye on the rice for me.

162
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:18,765
That smells good! I hope it's
crispy on the bottom how I like it.

163
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,967
It does smell good.
Miguel knows his paella.

164
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:24,883
No, I meant because
you were in charge.

165
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:29,368
Violeta, since we're talking I
wanted to bring up the other day...

166
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:32,408
Getting married and all that.

167
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:33,839
Oh, right.

168
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,726
Have you given it any thought?

169
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:41,565
Well, I have thought a bit
about it, but not much.

170
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:45,123
-My dad always knows what to do...
-Please, not your dad.

171
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,201
Don't give me that look.

172
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:50,726
My dad makes two lists:
one with advantages,

173
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:54,087
the other with disadvantages.
And he chooses the best solution.

174
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:57,322
I think the right thing
is to get married.

175
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:01,199
We have to start thinking about...
I'm not tying to pressure you.

176
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:02,644
That smells great.

177
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:08,165
Violeta, Jorge said we're going
to be a real family soon?

178
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:12,287
Then maybe you'll start thinking
about having kids...

179
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,520
This is to defend yourself, OK?

180
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:21,008
How about it?
Wouldn't you like a cousin?

181
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:25,559
Uncle Antonio says
Real Madrid fans are pussies.

182
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:26,685
What?

183
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:29,843
Don't teach the boy swearwords.

184
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,960
Real Madrid fans are machos.

185
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:36,840
Reel off Madrid's line-up
for your aunt and uncle.

186
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:39,205
Casillas, Salgado,

187
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:41,919


188
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:44,042
-Hierro...
-What are you doing?

189
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,399
Antonio...

190
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:48,565
So I can buy something
for the boys.

191
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,960
-You'll break parole.
-Give it back.

192
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:52,768
-The tall one...
-Antonio!

193
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:55,808
-OK, OK, sorry, sorry.
-Who was the tall one again?

194
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:57,804
Daddy!

195
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:59,562
-What are you doing?
-It fell.

196
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:02,608
You were stealing my purse!
You were stealing my purse!

197
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,726
I haven't stolen a thing!

198
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:07,609
What's wrong with you?
Think you're clever?

199
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:10,204
-Tell him to take it easy.
-I'm easy!

200
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:13,123
Calm down, sir,
I'm a policeman.

201
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:14,439
Hands off. Hands off.

202
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:17,329
That's it.
The man is a policeman.

203
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:19,879
That's it.
Everyone to their homes.

204
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:22,280
Solari, Raúl and Morientes.

205
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,724
You a cop?

206
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:26,240
I'll shove your truncheon
up your ass!

207
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:28,561
Let's try to enjoy the day.

208
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:29,845
Hands off, eh?

209
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:32,365
I'll roast that kid of yours.

210
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:34,441
Why you little jerk!

211
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:36,325
Hey! Antonio!

212
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:38,720
Violeta! Stop it!

213
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:41,040
I'll kill you, bitch!

214
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:43,164
Violeta, stop!

215
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:45,649
Violeta!

216
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:47,079
Violeta!

217
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:51,526
First you gave him a knife,

218
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:55,524
then you fight with a stranger?
Are you a good influence?

219
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,248
You've got to look for...

220
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:59,002
Yeah, I've started already.

221
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:01,809
I've bought a book.
I'm studying.

222
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:03,119
You bought it?

223
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:05,282
Yeah, smartass, I did.

224
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:07,609
I'm going to study.

225
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:10,967
Yeah, to be an engineer.

226
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:15,921
Working is the best way
to lead a normal life.

227
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:20,203
I'm going to study psychology.
How many times must I repeat it?

228
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:25,045
And Miguel, a Swiss army knife
is not a weapon.

229
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,161
It's a useful object.

230
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:31,204
It's even got a corkscrew
and a thing to clean your ears.

231
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:32,325
Antonio.

232
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,640
Careful with those ears, though.

233
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,801
We spoke with Gonzalo's dad

234
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:40,599
and he's prepared to let you
drive his taxi. How about it?

235
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:43,159
It's good money,
not like it used to be.

236
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:47,369
Do anything, for god's sake.
For once in your life.

237
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,521
I said I'm going to study!

238
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:53,207
That's the last time
you raise your voice to me.

239
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:57,643
Tomorrow you'll talk to Gonzalo's
dad and start work immediately.

240
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:00,284
You can't stay with Jorge
and Violeta forever.

241
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,361
He can stay as long as he likes.

242
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:04,441
I don't want to be
a taxi-driver.

243
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:06,726
I want to be a psychologist.

244
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:09,885
But that won't happen overnight.

245
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:13,326
You can’t just snap your fingers
and be a psychologist.

246
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:14,885
Antonio...

247
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:18,084
At 32 it's too late to choose.

248
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,365
Surprise!

249
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,165
What's this?

250
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:23,719
What do you think?
Our baby.

251
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:26,768
Look. That little thing
is its femur.

252
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:31,079
Its femur? Looks more like
a bird dropping to me.

253
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,842
Oh, stupid, don't say that.

254
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:36,688
We'll finally be a family.

255
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:40,322
You know what that means, Ramón?

256
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:41,809
Are you sure?

257
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:44,770
You know how many times we've
had sex in the last two months?

258
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:47,364
Of course I'm sure.
Look!

259
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:50,289
Shall we paint now or wait
and see if it's a boy or girl?

260
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:54,409
I can't decide between
a public or private nursery.

261
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,526
Three times in two months.

262
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:59,568
One, two, three.
Three times in two months.

263
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:03,130
Well look how lucky we've been.

264
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:06,250
To think that people
spend years tying

265
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:09,800
and we hit the bull
the first time round.

266
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:14,159
Don't worry, I told my dad
to give you a rise so we can...

267
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:18,767
Don't bring him into this!
I'll have to work even more.

268
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:20,886
No, it's not about him.

269
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:24,087
You should spend
more time with us.

270
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,969
Everything will be better
when the baby comes along.

271
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:28,245
Even...

272
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:29,805
sex.

273
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:33,163
What? I read that you can do it
even when you're pregnant.

274
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:36,249
Look, if you like,
I'll have some gin

275
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:39,447
and we can go at it.
It does my head in, but...

276
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:42,807
-You do my head in, Carla.
-I do your head in?

277
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:46,326
You mix your dad with the baby,
with the gin... it's no good.

278
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:47,639
I can't do it.

279
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:50,601
OK, darling, without the gin.

280
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:52,203
3, 4, testing.

281
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:55,760
-Taxi work's not easy, you know.
-Going hungry's harder.

282
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,840
Have you ever eaten rats
in the Sahara?

283
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:02,207
I have. You young people
have had it too easy.

284
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:05,885
That's true, but not Antonio.
He's a worker, aren't you?

285
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:09,565
I'm not scared of a little work.
Give me a week.

286
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:11,049
-He's got a great memory.
-Yeah?

287
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,802
-Unbelievable.
-Not like you.

288
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:14,085
Nice taxi, eh?

289
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,969
-He even failed his driving test.
-I was unlucky.

290
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:18,119
Eight times?

291
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:20,679
I always get the same examiner.
He hates me.

292
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:22,761
Tomás, your taxi
has no window divider.

293
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,045
That's for pussies.

294
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:27,566
I agree. The thing about being
a taxi-driver

295
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:31,439
is the contact with customers
and the window divider...

296
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:34,439
You've got the taxi
in your blood.

297
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:36,840
You remind me of myself
when I started.

298
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:40,400
But listen,
taxis aren't what they were.

299
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:42,640
All the "emigration"
and those darkies...

300
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:46,041
Hey, watch it!

301
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:47,802
I know who you are!

302
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:49,926
Antonio, come back over here.

303
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:52,365
Don't you worry, Tomás.

304
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,441
As long as I drive this cab,

305
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:57,568
all passengers must be clean
and pay up front.

306
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:58,685
Well said.

307
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:00,488
-So it's a deal?
-It's a deal.

308
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:06,086
Hello?

309
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:09,885
It's Violeta. I'm going for a drink
with Cristina and Antonia.

310
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:11,199
I know, you told me.

311
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:14,558
What a drag.
I really don't feel like it.

312
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:17,244
I'll just have one drink
and come home.

313
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,807
Maybe two or three.

314
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:21,608
<i>Don't wait up, OK?</i>

315
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:23,328
<i>How's your stomach?</i>

316
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:26,163
OK I guess.
Listen, I may be here all night...

317
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:28,969
studying a report.

318
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:30,843
Private conversations?

319
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:32,887
No, no. It's...

320
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:34,924
Good night.

321
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,528
Good night, Mr. Ramírez.

322
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,842
I'll stay here.

323
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:46,680
Violeta.

324
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:50,763
Listen, set aside 10 euros
and take a taxi home.

325
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:52,445
Goodbye.

326
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:12,925
Violeta?

327
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:17,562
You look beautiful.

328
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:25,401
Instead of booking a restaurant,
I took the liberty

329
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:27,481
of preparing a little picnic.

330
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:31,446
I wanted to talk to you
in a quiet place.

331
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:35,279
Can we stop at a gas station?

332
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:37,088
No, we're almost there.

333
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:40,879
And I wanted to show you

334
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:43,086
I'm not just
another businessman,

335
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,445
obsessed with making money.

336
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:49,046
I have other interests.
Art, poetry, a child's smile...

337
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:51,770
In short an all-rounder.
I'd describe myself...

338
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:54,763
as a love warrior,
a stupid romantic who thinks

339
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:57,125
it's the small gestures
that count.

340
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:00,363
Are you coming, Violeta?

341
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,842
Do you mind if
I read you my poem?

342
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:20,721
I can see you enjoy silence too.

343
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:25,969
It's called "Violeta."

344
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:32,399
"Your name is a flower.
Your eyes are sweet honey.

345
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:34,881
Fine silk your body...

346
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:38,328
As I sit alone,
you are right beside me.

347
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:43,365
Those veiled silences,
behind your lips in flower.

348
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:45,999
In flower...

349
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,444
like your name.

350
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:48,925
Violeta."

351
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:59,279
What's wrong?

352
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:01,042
Nothing, it's nothing.

353
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:05,169
Sometimes my eye goes,
but it's only a minute.

354
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:07,928
I wear a brace.

355
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:11,924
And also I'm complicated.

356
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:14,320
I mean,
I'm actually normal.

357
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:18,529
But initially, I'm complicated.
And I only wear my brace at home,

358
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:21,887
but I was nervous
and forgot to take it off.

359
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:25,040
I don't care about the brace.

360
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:28,041
Nor do I care about your eye.

361
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:32,840
Nobody's ever written me a poem.

362
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:40,164
-"No eating, no hair combing"?
-Only pigs comb their hair.

363
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:41,683
Not pigs.
You mean gypsies.

364
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:43,765
Not again.

365
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:49,085
A gypsy saved my life in prison,
so watch your mouth.

366
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:51,919
You've got to show
you mean business, Antonio.

367
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:54,964
Yesterday I almost smashed
this kid's head in...

368
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:58,168
What's your fucking problem?

369
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,798
Want me to smash your head in?

370
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:03,760
Never touch kids, Ramón!

371
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:07,127
You've got to discipline kids
by talking to them.

372
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:14,163
Ramón, are you alright?

373
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:19,681
Shit, if you've got a problem
I'm the one to talk to.

374
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:21,648
I'm fine, Antonio.

375
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:24,320
But I've had it with
your psychology crap.

376
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,208
It's not me.

377
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:29,407
People are in a bad way.

378
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:35,008
Like just now these two kids
got in the car with their G&T's

379
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:37,126
and "ha ha" this
and "ha ha" that...

380
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:40,805
I had to beat their asses
and leave them on the highway.

381
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:46,089
Because I used to be...
but respect, man, respect...

382
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,639
-You should never lose respect.
-Never.

383
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:52,323
And now I'm out on the town
with you lot,

384
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:57,481
eh, Gonzalo?
Enjoying a bit of conversation.

385
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:00,363
Tell us a story.

386
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:03,449
Well I was in an elevator
the other day

387
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:07,159
with this girl and she was...
Wow, she was tasty.

388
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:12,966
Gonzalo,
you're not getting much sex.

389
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:15,360
One year without it.
Since the ugly one.

390
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:16,679
Jorge told me.

391
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:19,489
Not a year, 6 or 9 months.
And she wasn't that ugly.

392
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:23,199
Gonzalo, look,
I'm taking you down the park.

393
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:28,361
You'd be surprised what they'll do
for a couple of bills. Coming?

394
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:29,804
You bet I am.

395
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:31,602
I've got toothache.

396
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:34,521
Are you going to fuck
with your teeth?

397
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:36,248
It'll be ready in two days.

398
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:38,241
Here. As usual.

399
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:40,239
I'll pay you now.

400
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:42,002
No, next time.

401
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:44,884
No, I'll pay you now.
Look, 2.50.

402
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:46,324
There it is.

403
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:49,080
Well fuck me,
it's the Monday misery.

404
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:52,284
The shirt again?
You'll make us rich.

405
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:53,878
It's just that...

406
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:55,768
I'm having you on.

407
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:58,038
Bingo.

408
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:06,128
So, today is Monday... Tuesday,
Wednesday... Wednesday then.

409
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:09,205
Goodbye.

410
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:10,565
Goodbye.

411
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:17,090
<i>To be a good pedestrian,</i>
<i>first look around.</i>

412
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:20,003
<i>You'll be a superstar</i>
<i>and you'll never get run down.</i>

413
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:24,723
<i>If you see a red light,</i>

414
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:30,448
<i>don't cross, don't you dare...</i>

415
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:33,444
<i>You'll end up in a wheelchair.</i>

416
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:39,962
You want to give up patrolling
to sing that

417
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:41,679
in schools?

418
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:46,085
Last year 52 children
were run over in the district.

419
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:49,845
And modestly considering
myself a songwriter,

420
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:51,966
-I think...
-Please, Miguel.

421
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:54,724
Go back to work.

422
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:02,726
I feel so old...

423
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:05,279
In all modesty

424
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:08,362
I have written a more lively

425
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:09,686
"rap" version.

426
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:11,681
It goes something like this:

427
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:14,965
<i>To be a good pedestrian,</i>

428
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:17,439
<i>first look around.</i>
<i>You'll be a superstar...</i>

429
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:19,289
<i>A superstar...</i>

430
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:23,200
So,

431
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:25,083
so old.

432
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:31,001
You son of a bitch.

433
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:33,287
-Jorge.
-Did you see that?

434
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:34,724
-Jorge.
-What?

435
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:37,446
Have you considered therapy?

436
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:39,085
What?

437
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:42,004
Therapy, Jorge.
I'm worried about you.

438
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:45,887
In fact, I'm worried about
all of you. Have you seen Miguel?

439
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,324
What about him?

440
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:51,642
What do you mean?
Can't you see he's stooping?

441
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:53,084
And you know why?

442
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:57,084
He's got Patricia's foot on the back
of his neck and he can't get up.

443
00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:01,283
Miguel's married, steady job,
he's fine. Watch the soccer.

444
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:04,203
-And Ramón and Gonzalo.
-They're fine.

445
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:06,326
We went whore-hunting
the other day.

446
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:07,923
Whore-hunting?

447
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:10,444
No, Antonio.

448
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:12,043
Don't go crazy.

449
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:15,247
Concentrate on the taxi.
On a normal life. Not hookers.

450
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:18,288
But you said Gonzalo
hadn't been laid for a year.

451
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:19,360
So?

452
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:22,084
You know what that nerd
is doing lately?

453
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:24,684
He jerks off to toll-free
information numbers.

454
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:25,760
Toll-free?

455
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:29,047
Yeah, because he says the voices
have a porno ring to them.

456
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:33,283
Gonzalo needs to do some serious
studying and get his fucking degree

457
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:34,087
and a job.

458
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,365
-Hello.
-Hi.

459
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,923
-Where did you go?
-For a drink with the girls.

460
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:41,286
-I'm having a shower.
-Next time call.

461
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:43,759
We were worried.
A shower at this hour?

462
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:45,841
Yes, what's the big deal?

463
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:49,559
In Europe everyone showers
at night and I feel like it.

464
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:53,042
-Well take a shower then.
-Go ahead.

465
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:55,759
And don't go whore-hunting.

466
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:58,319
I'm asking you nicely.
There are diseases...

467
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:01,050
-I did it for their own good.
-Save your money.

468
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,689
Asshole!

469
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:09,245
-Jorge, listen...
-What?

470
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:14,162
Your dad is bald, right?

471
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:15,809
Yeah, always has been.

472
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:19,201
OK. When you watch a match,
what goes through your mind?

473
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:21,600
Nothing. I just watch,
if I'm allowed.

474
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,682
When you watch the match

475
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:28,684
you're thinking that the ball
is your father's head

476
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:30,688
and you have to kick it.

477
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:35,042
Antonio, don't start getting
weird on me. No, no, no.

478
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:38,805
I'm perfectly fine.
It's you I'm worried about.

479
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:41,723
And the rest of them.
The thing is...

480
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:46,160
You want to hear a secret?

481
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:51,523
Tomorrow I'm going to ask
your sister Violeta to marry me.

482
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:56,359
Wow!

483
00:25:57,530 --> 00:26:00,886
I've bought her a ring,
cost me a fortune.

484
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,683
That's great!

485
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:14,163
This place is really expensive.

486
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:15,605
Don't worry.

487
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:19,166
This month we haven't eaten out.
Only one trip to the cinema...

488
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:21,764
so we still have two left.

489
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:25,206
I also wanted to see you because
lately I've noticed you're a bit

490
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:27,679
-cold with me.
-Cold? No.

491
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:30,569
Yeah, ice cold,
but it's not your fault.

492
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:33,165
In fact,

493
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:37,086
I wanted to explain the dinner.

494
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:41,329
Sometimes...

495
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:44,529
I mean, in life... my father...
there's a point...

496
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:47,045
when a man has to live his life.

497
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:51,647
I've got to go to the toilet.

498
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:46,319
False alarm.

499
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:50,168
I was explaining

500
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:54,005
that there's a point in life

501
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:57,200
when a man has to take

502
00:27:57,370 --> 00:28:00,919
a series of steps, and I know
the other day I was abrupt...

503
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:08,727
but I want to do things right.

504
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:10,642
I've got it all planned.

505
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:13,885
Life...

506
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:17,480
consists of...

507
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:21,486
moments...

508
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:35,278
Would you shut up!

509
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:44,205
Here. It fell.

510
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:50,045
Violeta.

511
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:53,520
Shit!

512
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:57,482
Will you marry me?

513
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:02,925
Don't you like it?

514
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:05,923
What do you say?

515
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:08,769
-It's lovely.
-I mean about getting married.

516
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:13,119
I don't know
if that's possible, Jorge.

517
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:17,283
It's so sudden
and it's a bad time right now.

518
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:21,400
We've been living together for two
years and going together for eight.

519
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:22,719
It's time for marriage.

520
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:26,927
I know, Jorge,
but I can't marry you now.

521
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:28,921
I'm in love

522
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:32,085
No...

523
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:34,241
I think so,
love is never really

524
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:37,322
straight forward, but...

525
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:40,045
Oh Jorge,
there are just times

526
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:43,566
in a woman's life
that it's not on.

527
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:44,765
Right?

528
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:51,642
<i>My love has been taken away</i>

529
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:55,170
<i>by the waves</i>

530
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:59,285
<i>like a fish that is sinking</i>

531
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:02,209
<i>into the abyss...</i>

532
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:06,250
I'm really busy.
Helping a friend to move.

533
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:08,128
Come on Jorge, big man.

534
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:10,884
Jorge, you're falling...
Down for the count.

535
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:12,684
What's wrong, Jorge?

536
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:14,966
-Leave me alone for a moment.
-Don't be a pussy.

537
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:16,404
-Just a moment.
-Up you go.

538
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:17,685
OK then.

539
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:19,199
I'm fine.

540
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:22,443
Cheer up, Jorge.
I'll look after you.

541
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:24,566
We'll be fine in the house.

542
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:27,563
-In your grandma's shit-hole?
-It's retro, man.

543
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:34,445
I'm sorry, but I'm in pain...

544
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:39,843
Shit, it's the trophy we won in
that soccer tournament, remember?

545
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:41,284
<i>We are the champions...</i>

546
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:44,203
The only time
I ever won anything.

547
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:47,839
I'm going to sort out
the removal van.

548
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,442
Listen guys, Jorge

549
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:58,089
is in a bad state.

550
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:00,249
He needs help.

551
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:03,686
Don't worry,
I've got a plan.

552
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:07,449
We'll sign up for a 7-aside
local soccer tournament.

553
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:12,199
Why would we play soccer
now, Antonio?

554
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,247
I'm very busy these days

555
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:16,970
preparing my part
for the movie.

556
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:20,881
What sort of creatures are you?

557
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:25,765
Jorge needs to win something.

558
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:29,286
I'll do it.
I'll be goalie.

559
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:31,680
How about swimming?
An all-round sport.

560
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:34,080
Yeah, or fucking water-polo!

561
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:36,764
Water-polo chicks
have great asses.

562
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:39,603
Or a bit of both.
Soccer and water-polo.

563
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:41,089
You can't swim, fatso.

564
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:43,923
Will you concentrate
for once in your lives

565
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:46,524
and think about other people?

566
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:48,482
We're going to play soccer

567
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:50,039
until we win.

568
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:51,882
Even if it takes three years.

569
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:57,159
Charly, when was the last time
you cleaned the bath?

570
00:31:58,370 --> 00:31:59,962
October. October.

571
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:03,645
-I'll have to sit by him.
-Jorge, take a seat.

572
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:09,325
We've something to tell you.

573
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:11,649
We joined a soccer league.

574
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:14,843
Like the one we won, remember?

575
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:18,000
Do you want to play soccer,
Antonio?

576
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:20,761
Do I want to?

577
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:22,841
Do I want to?

578
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:25,963
-But we're only six.
-I know, I've got it covered.

579
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:28,241
I'll call a friend.

580
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:32,482
A born star.

581
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:35,039
-Where's the phone?
-In the bathroom.

582
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:39,006
We're going to be big,
real big.

583
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:41,166
Antonio.

584
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:43,844
Be careful.
It must stink in there.

585
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:49,203
No, it's not funny.

586
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:51,521
I know you don't want to,

587
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:52,999
neither do I.

588
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:54,603
But we have to.

589
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:55,998
Antonio is not well.

590
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:57,603
We have to help him.

591
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:00,249
A bit of soccer

592
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:02,640
will be good for him,
because he has

593
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:04,084
too much free time.

594
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:08,247
So from tomorrow

595
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:11,763
we start training...

596
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:16,524
with enthusiasm.

597
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:18,605
All the way.

598
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:36,202
That's it.

599
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:37,599
I can't run anymore.

600
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:40,001
We only started four minutes ago.

601
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:43,526
This is the best thing
we've ever done, eh, Jorge?

602
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:45,282
We've got to keep going.

603
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:48,522
Antonio, I'm dizzy.
Let's take it easy.

604
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:51,079
We can't take it easy,
can we?

605
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:53,480
No, you can't take it easy.
Ramón, stop smoking!

606
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:55,481
Dad, Mum says

607
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:58,847
to stop fucking around

608
00:33:59,010 --> 00:33:59,965
for lunch!

609
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:03,042
Pablito, tell your mum to wait!
We're training!

610
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:04,359
I'm coming darling.

611
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:06,919
Dad, what's "fucking around"?

612
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:08,887
What daddy does
with that guitar.

613
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:10,165
Lunchtime!

614
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:12,286
Isn't 134 quite a high
pulse-rate?

615
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:14,361
-That's nothing.
-My chest hurts.

616
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:17,400
What's the name of our team?

617
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:20,289
Something funny like
"the Munich Munchkins"

618
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:23,328
or "Jus Godup"
or "Bitta Tapwater."

619
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:25,446
Miguel, you're in a sad way.

620
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:28,488
I'm starting to see white dots.

621
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:31,403
I'm shivering
and my chest is thumping.

622
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:34,448
-Go to the hospital, Gonzalo.
-It really hurts.

623
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:37,040
Now listen for one second.

624
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:41,203
I've thought of a name,
but it has to be a special name.

625
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:43,689
A winning name.

626
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,199
"Brazil."

627
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:47,884
"Brazil."

628
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:50,048
-I like it.
-Sounds good.

629
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:52,485
-"Bitta Tapwater" is better.
-"Brazil."

630
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:56,165
My chest is thumping.
And my vision is all blurry.

631
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:58,321
Gonzalo, lunch is ready.

632
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:00,401
-Coming, Mum!
-We haven't finished.

633
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:04,404
Gonzalo, fuck it,
Antonio's saying...

634
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:06,800
I'm sick of all this
running around.

635
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:08,881
No, Ramón, please.

636
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:11,201
Same time tomorrow.

637
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:16,928
Charly, we're training!

638
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:18,523
-Carlos!
-Charly!

639
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:22,524
-Well, do we keep going?
-We most certainly do.

640
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:26,046
Miguel, come right now
or you'll eat in the kitchen!

641
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:28,722
-Right.
-Pay no attention.

642
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:30,323
I've got to go, Antonio.

643
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:34,961
Shit, she's got you performing
like a monkey.

644
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:36,603
You're on a chain.

645
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:40,366
I'm sorry, Jorge.
This is it.

646
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:42,122
Well... maybe...

647
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:44,246
Shall we carry on or maybe...?

648
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:47,126
I said I wouldn't let you down.

649
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:50,680
I'll do three more laps with you.

650
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:51,760
Three?

651
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:54,400
Seven.

652
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:55,766
Six.

653
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:57,648
-Six laps?
-Seven, seven.

654
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:00,279
If we go the other way
we won't get dizzy.

655
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:02,042
-Go on then.
-Here we go.

656
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:05,367
This'll do us good.

657
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:08,847
You're looking good.
Looking good, Antonio.

658
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:17,959
Not again!

659
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:21,520
I told you it's alright.
You can wear your brace.

660
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:28,003
There, that's it.

661
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:41,319
Violeta?

662
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:42,605
Hi!

663
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:45,480
We're watching a great movie.

664
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:47,801
What the fuck...

665
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:51,406
Who's this?

666
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:52,964
Daniel?

667
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:54,206
Yes.

668
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:58,559
You're Antonio. Pleased to meet you.
I've heard so much.

669
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,480
What are you playing,
dressing up?

670
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:04,838
No, this is something that...

671
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:06,125
Sit down.

672
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:07,560
Yes.

673
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:09,004
Go on, sit.

674
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:17,125
Well I don't know much
about you at all.

675
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:21,728
So let's have a little chat
the three of us.

676
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:24,283
Just a little while.

677
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:25,446
OK.

678
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:29,883
Do you have parents?

679
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:45,088
Carlos, fuck it, place it here!

680
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:48,404
Pass the fucking ball!

681
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:51,685
Look, like this.

682
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:52,846
Like this.

683
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:54,880
Shit!

684
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:58,370
Jorge, why did you
get in the way?

685
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:02,401
-You're not with it.
-I'm OK.

686
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:05,448
Why were you in the way?
Why?

687
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:06,759
-Got an itch?
-You too?

688
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:08,045
-When?
-The hooker.

689
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:09,359
-We caught something.
-What?

690
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:13,205
I don't know. Syphilis, a chancre,
gonorrhea, VD or something.

691
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:16,601
Antonio, we caught something from
the hooker. Does your cock itch?

692
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:20,285
My cock is my business.
Concentrate on the game.

693
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:22,327
We're here to win.

694
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:24,801
Jorge, we went to a hooker.

695
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:29,088
I know. This is a complete mess.
We should all be...

696
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:33,243
A man is made to work, pay his
mortgage and look after his family.

697
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:35,366
That's life. Not hookers.

698
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:37,919
Gonzalo needs hookers.
It's an experience for him.

699
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:40,479
-Don't mess things up.
-Don't mess what up?

700
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:44,848
Come on, let's see.
Did you use a condom?

701
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:46,443
Of course we did.

702
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:48,885
Little warts...

703
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:50,642
Typical glocozoma.

704
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:54,325
Get a brush and put some anti-septic
on your dick. I have some.

705
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:56,879
Gonzalo, put your prick away.

706
00:38:57,050 --> 00:38:58,642
To think you paid for sex.

707
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:00,766
Maybe you should try it.

708
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:03,490
My sex life is completely normal.

709
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:05,083
Don't tell Carla about it.

710
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:07,810
Carla won't find out.
She's stuck at home pregnant.

711
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:11,007
Carla's pregnant?
And you with a rotten dick.

712
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:13,730
-What if you infected the kid?
-You're having a kid?

713
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:15,843
Congratulations.

714
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:19,043
You need to decide:
public or private nursery.

715
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:21,929
Children's schooling
is a real trauma, but you have to...

716
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:23,239
Get off my back.

717
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:25,002
I'm going to stay on your back.

718
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:29,083
The first five years of a child's
life will shape its personality.

719
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:31,249
I'll be watching you.

720
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:34,322
Just a bit, my balls hurt.

721
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:37,209
It's not fair. You screw around
your whole life and nothing happens.

722
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:39,281
I see a hooker once
and I'm screwed.

723
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:41,406
I told you to use a good condom.

724
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:44,642
You can't sell your cock short.
Is that a bite?

725
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:47,085
Can't you see I'm going to die?

726
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:50,447
I'm diseased!
This whole area's fucked up!

727
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:52,202
Please! Please!

728
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:56,120
This is Serafín,
our seventh man.

729
00:39:56,290 --> 00:40:00,283
This is Miguel, Ramón, Charly,
Jorge and Gonzalo.

730
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:01,360
Hello.

731
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:04,048
-Pleased to meet you.
-Welcome.

732
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:06,682
You're the actor, right?

733
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:11,243
Well don't act up to me, OK?

734
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:14,208
And no looking at her.
Not you or anyone.

735
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:18,363
Let it be clear from the start.
This is the sort of company I keep.

736
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:21,249
-Sit down, baby.
-I'll just put this down.

737
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:26,288
-Now let's play properly!
-Antonio, who is he?

738
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:29,203
He's a gentleman. A magician.

739
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:34,203
I'll give you a call, OK.
Bye.

740
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:40,487
Look out!

741
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:41,885
Oh fuck it!

742
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:45,924
Fucking hell!

743
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:49,804
Gonzalo, what are you?
A statue?

744
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:51,403
-It was unstoppable.
-No, it wasn't.

745
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:53,640
-Yeah, but it was a strike.
-A strike?

746
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:55,846
There are no strikes
when you're 30.

747
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:59,605
It's my fault. I'm really bad,
and I got a cramp.

748
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:01,328
No, <i>they're</i> bad.

749
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:03,879
-You're a cripple.
-We need a one-two.

750
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:05,039
A strike!

751
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:07,485
And you left me alone.
Either defend or...

752
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:10,528
Gonzalo, don't cry, man.
Don't cry on me.

753
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:12,681
Miguel, look down the wing.

754
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:14,045
Well pass it to me.

755
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:15,325
Pass it on.

756
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:16,559
We can catch them up!

757
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:18,761
She's very attractive
your friend.

758
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:22,161
Attractive? Her pussy looks like
a cat stretched out.

759
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:25,129
Now listen, please.

760
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:26,399
Listen up!

761
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:30,882
What we need to do
is visualize our victory.

762
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:35,883
If we don't do that,

763
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:39,008
this is a load of shit,

764
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:41,730
the biggest shit ever!

765
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:46,486
I'm visualizing on the wing,
but no one passes to me.

766
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:48,288
You saw, didn't you?

767
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:53,969
Don't look at her.
I'll end your career with one call.

768
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:57,361
You don't know who I am.
You'll never work in cinema again.

769
00:41:57,530 --> 00:41:59,725
Whenever I fucking feel like it.

770
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:01,323
It wasn't like that...

771
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:03,128
-I'll smash your head in.
-OK, I get it.

772
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:05,679
Don't worry, Antonio.
He'll see.

773
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:08,288
Serafín, I'm sorry.

774
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:11,647
No, don't you suffer.
You and I are above all this.

775
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:13,085
Come on, "Brazil"!

776
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:15,559
Jorge!

777
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:17,762
Come on, let's go!

778
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:19,045
Hello?

779
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:22,640
Well fuck me,
it's a producer.

780
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:25,168
Come on, pass it!

781
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:27,605
What's that asshole doing?

782
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:30,045
Show him my video-book.
Go on, shoot.

783
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:34,322
Let's see what you've got!

784
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:40,966
Damn it, you were alone again!

785
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:42,722
We can't play without T-shirts.

786
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:46,246
The fuck with it. I'm not letting
a bunch of kids beat me!

787
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:48,842
-Boys, the ball.
-They're not boys.

788
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:50,329
They're grown men.

789
00:42:56,530 --> 00:42:58,122
I can see the light.

790
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:01,522
I can see the light.

791
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:04,919
Bye, baldy!

792
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:06,523
Son of a bitch.

793
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:08,328
No respect, no values...

794
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:09,161
Fuck you!

795
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:12,889
What are you doing here?

796
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:17,441
Nothing, it's my coffee break.
How's the whole baby thing going?

797
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:19,441
-We're fucking delighted.
-Sure.

798
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:22,527
I'll tell that
slag mother of yours

799
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:24,521
what a son of a bitch you are!

800
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:25,645
Fuck you, faggot!

801
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:28,244
You're at an important time
of your life.

802
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:30,765
You've got to be there
and centered.

803
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:33,804
Spare me the psycho crap.
No more Dr. Antonio.

804
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:35,164
I'm not like Antonio.

805
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:37,241
That light thing
and the weird stuff...

806
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:39,242
Your friend's a pussy!

807
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:41,526
He means you.

808
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:44,570
They're just kids.
They don't know.

809
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:49,245
If you've got any problems
just let me know, OK?

810
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:50,880
Martin!

811
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:54,521
Take your feet off the seat
or I'll rip your fucking head off!

812
00:43:56,330 --> 00:43:58,082
<i>Ramón, you piece of shit.</i>

813
00:43:58,250 --> 00:43:59,444
<i>Baldy, baldy prick.</i>

814
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:00,884
<i>Your mother is a slag.</i>

815
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:03,006
<i>Your father is a fag...</i>

816
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:04,000
I'm off.

817
00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:08,408
I heard the president
of the FIFA last night...

818
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:10,803
It's not looking good.

819
00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:12,767
We'll give them a beating.

820
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:14,966
No, when it gets to the match...

821
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:16,245
See you, Ramón.

822
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:17,923
<i>Baldy, baldy prick.</i>

823
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:21,765
<i>Your mother is a slag.</i>
<i>Your father is a fag...</i>

824
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:24,609
<i>Ramón, you piece of shit.</i>

825
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:41,040
Macarena.

826
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:45,680
Hello.

827
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:49,404
When did you get out?

828
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:51,004
Not long ago.

829
00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:55,885
Are you alright?

830
00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:00,721
I'm working as a cab-driver now.

831
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:04,048
They've put me in charge.

832
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,162
Yeah, Toñi told me.

833
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:09,209
Everything OK?

834
00:45:10,130 --> 00:45:11,119
Yes.

835
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:14,087
You'd given up smoking.

836
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:17,764
This is a load of shit.

837
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:30,080
Do you like driving the cab?

838
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:32,400
Yes.

839
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:34,681
And I'm studying psychology.

840
00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:44,446
I've missed you loads.

841
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:47,524
Me too.

842
00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:52,568
Do you want a ride?

843
00:45:56,570 --> 00:45:58,686
I won't charge you the fare.

844
00:46:02,570 --> 00:46:03,798
Yes or no?

845
00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:05,085
Yes.

846
00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:09,165
Hop in.

847
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:28,565
Do you like it?

848
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:31,445
I don't know.

849
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:34,439
Well it comes with a surprise.

850
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:39,209
Stop pushing me about, Carla.
I'm reading.

851
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:41,363
Aren't you going to open it?

852
00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:43,642
Well, I'll open it then.

853
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:49,120
A weekend trip to Paris!

854
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:52,399
You've always wanted
to go there.

855
00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:53,400
What money?

856
00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:57,764
My father gave it to me. He's over
the moon with his first grandchild.

857
00:46:57,930 --> 00:47:01,047
By the way, he says definitely
a private nursery.

858
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:05,681
Don't talk to him about our stuff.
I'm fed up of telling you.

859
00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:09,120
Well are you pleased
about the trip?

860
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:18,930
I can't go that weekend.
I've got a match.

861
00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:22,601
Well I'll change it...

862
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:24,484
I'm tying to read.

863
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:26,403
There's just no way.

864
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:39,565
Honey.

865
00:47:41,210 --> 00:47:43,280
Do you think I have talent?

866
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:46,120
No.

867
00:47:54,690 --> 00:47:56,601
Say what you want, Antonio,

868
00:47:56,770 --> 00:48:00,445
but don't bring up my father's
relationship with me as a child.

869
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:03,170
It gives me the shivers
what you're doing.

870
00:48:03,330 --> 00:48:04,445
Goodbye.

871
00:48:04,610 --> 00:48:06,840
Jorge, Jorge, Jorge.

872
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:10,364
Another 15 cock-ups
that'll cost me half a grand?

873
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:12,920
You think I want to lose
half a grand?

874
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:14,722
No, but I revised it...

875
00:48:14,890 --> 00:48:17,279
-No, no, no.
-Not just once.

876
00:48:17,450 --> 00:48:18,439
Shut up.

877
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:21,720
Shut up, Jorgito, I'm talking.

878
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:24,765
Have you seen my car
parked outside?

879
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:27,559
-You like it, don't you?
-Yes, I do.

880
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:30,290
The insurance costs me
half a grand. Will you pay it?

881
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:35,124
Well?
What are you looking at?

882
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:38,641
You're not going to pay it?

883
00:48:38,810 --> 00:48:42,041
Well, I'm not going to pay out
half a grand because of you.

884
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:44,804
And I won't fire you
because that would cost too much.

885
00:48:44,970 --> 00:48:46,528
You're stuck here forever.

886
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:49,602
<i>And if you try</i>
<i>to fuck me up again,</i>

887
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:51,721
<i>I'll crush you into the ground.</i>

888
00:48:52,010 --> 00:48:53,443
<i>I'll be your shadow.</i>

889
00:48:53,610 --> 00:48:55,885
-Jorge! Lend me 5 euros.
-5 euros?

890
00:48:56,690 --> 00:48:58,282
But pay me back.
I've only ten left.

891
00:48:58,450 --> 00:49:00,680
Too bad for you.
How's your belly?

892
00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:01,965
Fine.
Where are you going?

893
00:49:02,130 --> 00:49:04,041
To the dry cleaner's
to see the blondie!

894
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:07,204
-You mean to wash them...
-Yeah, obviously.

895
00:49:07,370 --> 00:49:10,760
-But I wash and clean at home...
-You can't, you're exhausted!

896
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:13,649
They're clean, they smell of
softener. Come on, let's go home.

897
00:49:13,810 --> 00:49:15,766
You're right. Come on then.

898
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:18,169
What are you doing?

899
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:19,285
That's it.

900
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:21,042
Give me the pants!

901
00:49:21,650 --> 00:49:23,720
Give me the pants!

902
00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:26,882
-You're not looking good.
-I wash and iron, I told you.

903
00:49:28,490 --> 00:49:31,050
-I'll make you an egg soup!
-I hate egg soup!

904
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:32,444
Jorge, please!

905
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:40,166
-Hello, gorgeous.
-Hello, handsome.

906
00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:41,126
Hi.

907
00:49:41,450 --> 00:49:44,806
-I've brought these pants.
-Half of them.

908
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:48,560
But what have you done, boy?
You're crazy.

909
00:49:48,730 --> 00:49:49,924
Half a pair of pants.

910
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:52,086
Here's the other half!
Thanks, man.

911
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:56,442
What a surprise,
today's not Monday.

912
00:49:57,050 --> 00:49:58,165
It's not?

913
00:49:58,330 --> 00:49:59,809
Well, in that case...

914
00:50:00,290 --> 00:50:02,565
So I've got no clothes
to pick up?

915
00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:03,321
No.

916
00:50:03,770 --> 00:50:06,000
OK then, you're on your way.

917
00:50:06,890 --> 00:50:08,323
What's wrong? You look ill.

918
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:12,207
No, nothing.
We're in a hurry, aren't we?

919
00:50:12,370 --> 00:50:15,282
We've got to hurry
because we're in a hurry.

920
00:50:18,530 --> 00:50:22,284
I was in a hurry because
I wanted to ask you for dinner.

921
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:26,448
Son of a bitch.
It's been pissing me off all day.

922
00:50:27,810 --> 00:50:29,801
When are we going to dinner?
Tonight?

923
00:50:36,610 --> 00:50:39,602
Wait a minute. This isn't
a good place. The table's wet.

924
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:42,079
Let's try the kitchen.
There's a table...

925
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:44,679
in there.

926
00:50:45,770 --> 00:50:48,443
Make sure you feed
that cute little ass...

927
00:50:52,930 --> 00:50:54,966
What does your job involve?

928
00:50:55,130 --> 00:50:56,358
My job?

929
00:50:56,530 --> 00:51:00,159
It's hard to explain.
It involves cleaning clothes,

930
00:51:00,330 --> 00:51:03,925
which include a shirt of yours
once a week.

931
00:51:04,090 --> 00:51:08,447
That's because I like
to go to work looking smart.

932
00:51:08,610 --> 00:51:13,206
I don't think anyone could ever
criticize my appearance.

933
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:16,204
I'm inflexible about that,
joking apart.

934
00:51:16,370 --> 00:51:18,008
Only your shirt?

935
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:20,445
No, everything.

936
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:24,922
My job involves numbers,
I mean, I work with paper.

937
00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:28,363
The lower half of my body
is completely covered up.

938
00:51:28,530 --> 00:51:32,762
I hang up my jacket every morning,
so it all comes down to my shirt.

939
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:35,080
Jorge, you're really cute.

940
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:42,201
In my job I have
an intermediary function

941
00:51:42,370 --> 00:51:44,759
but with prospects of promotion.

942
00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:48,559
I think I have a positive image

943
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:52,564
in the company and anytime now
I could get moved up.

944
00:51:53,890 --> 00:51:56,040
-Do you feel at ease?
-Very much.

945
00:51:56,210 --> 00:51:59,805
Management really trusts in me
and that's important.

946
00:51:59,970 --> 00:52:01,198
Kiss me.

947
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:08,443
Any promotion prospects
at the dry cleaner's?

948
00:52:08,610 --> 00:52:11,044
Jorge, do you like me?

949
00:52:13,890 --> 00:52:15,323
Don't worry.

950
00:52:15,490 --> 00:52:18,721
When I worked at the brewery
I built up some strong arms.

951
00:52:21,170 --> 00:52:23,081
What a great night!

952
00:52:23,530 --> 00:52:27,648
Yesterday I'd never have believed
I'd be having such fun tonight.

953
00:52:27,810 --> 00:52:28,845
Right, Jorge?

954
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:33,162
Sometimes I feel like going to the
station and getting on a train...

955
00:52:33,490 --> 00:52:34,718
to anywhere...

956
00:52:36,210 --> 00:52:37,404
Idiot!

957
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:41,119
What's the matter?
What's all the train shit?

958
00:52:41,290 --> 00:52:42,723
I don't know.

959
00:52:42,890 --> 00:52:45,643
Big mistake, Jorge.
Don't you like her?

960
00:52:45,810 --> 00:52:46,959
-It's not that.
-We'll swap.

961
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:48,245
No, no.

962
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:52,126
The spunky one turns me on.
Yours isn't bad either.

963
00:52:52,290 --> 00:52:54,565
That's it.
Put the plate down.

964
00:52:54,730 --> 00:52:55,640
Orgy.

965
00:52:56,650 --> 00:52:58,242
How about a few shots?

966
00:52:58,410 --> 00:53:00,128
-No.
-Shall we dance?

967
00:53:14,530 --> 00:53:16,521
I don't know how to dance.

968
00:53:16,690 --> 00:53:17,679
Look.

969
00:53:18,810 --> 00:53:22,280
-Like that, like that.
-I can't, I'm sorry.

970
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:24,839
I have to get up early tomorrow.

971
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:27,326
-OK then, I'll be going.
-Going?

972
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:28,844
What do you mean?

973
00:53:29,730 --> 00:53:33,609
The night is young. Jorge,
did you tell her about my movie?

974
00:53:33,770 --> 00:53:34,600
No.

975
00:53:35,290 --> 00:53:37,201
Shall we play the shots game?

976
00:53:37,970 --> 00:53:40,165
What game's that?

977
00:53:40,330 --> 00:53:41,479
Are you staying?

978
00:53:41,730 --> 00:53:43,686
Yeah, I think I'll fuck this one.

979
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:50,242
Jorge, you should know
I really like you.

980
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:07,280
<i>And therapy?</i>
<i>It'd do them some good.</i>

981
00:54:07,450 --> 00:54:10,647
I haven't stopped
going on about it,

982
00:54:10,810 --> 00:54:13,643
but they don't understand.
So what happens?

983
00:54:13,810 --> 00:54:17,439
I have to look out for each
fucking one of them and right now

984
00:54:17,610 --> 00:54:20,283
it's too much crap.
It's a bad time.

985
00:54:20,450 --> 00:54:23,362
I'm just getting started
with the taxi...

986
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:27,889
There's lots of little things
to think about:

987
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:30,803
picking up a fare, "bim,"
the numbers.

988
00:54:30,970 --> 00:54:34,645
Whenever someone waves, "bam"...

989
00:54:34,810 --> 00:54:36,448
pulling up to the sidewalk...

990
00:54:36,610 --> 00:54:39,602
That's really nice.
You've got the taxi in your blood.

991
00:54:39,770 --> 00:54:42,204
-I've learnt the Bible by heart.
-In a week?

992
00:54:42,610 --> 00:54:44,248
I've got the outskirts left.

993
00:54:44,410 --> 00:54:47,402
That's what surprises me about you.
You're really sharp.

994
00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:52,209
What I wanted
to talk to you about is this.

995
00:54:53,010 --> 00:54:55,160
They have to start winning
at soccer.

996
00:54:55,890 --> 00:54:59,087
Do you get me?
If they see themselves winning...

997
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:01,400
A goal, another goal...

998
00:55:01,570 --> 00:55:04,004
that will encourage them
in their lives

999
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:06,604
and help them see the light.

1000
00:55:07,130 --> 00:55:10,122
Let me tell you something.
I've said it a thousand times.

1001
00:55:10,290 --> 00:55:11,882
Life is complicated.

1002
00:55:12,050 --> 00:55:15,008
Although it seems simple,
the going's not always easy.

1003
00:55:15,170 --> 00:55:19,004
I know. For them to get their heads
round something like this...

1004
00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:21,161
-Four months.
-Each.

1005
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:25,087
Why do you think
my sister left Jorge?

1006
00:55:25,650 --> 00:55:29,962
For that exact reason.
He doesn't get it and he's a bit...

1007
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:31,604
-A bit...
-Dull.

1008
00:55:31,770 --> 00:55:33,408
Yeah, sort of murky.

1009
00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:35,959
Yeah, like a bit blurry,
like something... yeah.

1010
00:55:36,130 --> 00:55:38,405
Well you'll have to help me out.

1011
00:55:38,570 --> 00:55:40,003
I'm here whenever you need me.

1012
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:42,126
Because it's all five of them.

1013
00:55:42,290 --> 00:55:45,168
And heavy problems,
because in my book

1014
00:55:45,330 --> 00:55:48,879
their kind of problems
aren't even in there.

1015
00:55:49,130 --> 00:55:51,200
So will you help me or what?

1016
00:55:51,370 --> 00:55:53,008
Will I help you, Antonio?

1017
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:56,322
Antonio, if you say it's daytime,
for me it's daytime.

1018
00:55:56,490 --> 00:55:59,527
Friends in need
are friends indeed.

1019
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:02,729
-OK.
-Alright.

1020
00:56:03,890 --> 00:56:04,879
Here goes.

1021
00:56:07,210 --> 00:56:08,848
Here's to you
and your balls.

1022
00:56:10,210 --> 00:56:13,088
Let's see, you studs.
We've got a surprise for you.

1023
00:56:13,330 --> 00:56:16,049
New T-shirts and shorts.
The complete kit.

1024
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:18,121
We needed a better
"equipament."

1025
00:56:18,290 --> 00:56:19,405
Brazil! Shit...

1026
00:56:19,570 --> 00:56:22,209
But we're "Bitta Tapwater."

1027
00:56:23,210 --> 00:56:26,088
Good on you, Antonio.
Now there's no stopping us.

1028
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:28,161
Remember the tactics
I showed you.

1029
00:56:28,330 --> 00:56:29,922
With this dick...

1030
00:56:30,090 --> 00:56:33,287
They'll burn them with a blowlamp
and scorch our dicks to cinder.

1031
00:56:33,450 --> 00:56:36,044
Even if it's burnt you can...

1032
00:56:36,210 --> 00:56:38,440
No way. Month and half
without getting laid.

1033
00:56:38,610 --> 00:56:40,521
Carla would go on heat.

1034
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:41,964
And careful jacking off!

1035
00:56:42,130 --> 00:56:44,519
Don't get distracted:
think tactics.

1036
00:56:44,690 --> 00:56:47,079
Study while you can, Gonzalo.

1037
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:50,287
No, no. You do it.

1038
00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:52,406
You should have tried sandpaper.

1039
00:56:52,570 --> 00:56:54,481
-On our dicks?
-And anywhere else.

1040
00:56:54,650 --> 00:56:57,881
Sorry, I had to bring the baby.
Patricia had plans.

1041
00:56:58,050 --> 00:56:59,483
To hell with kids.

1042
00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:01,402
-By the way...
-No, fuck by the way.

1043
00:57:01,570 --> 00:57:05,085
Careful, eh? You don't know me.
I'll break your...

1044
00:57:05,370 --> 00:57:07,326
Here.
Four's your lucky number.

1045
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:10,846
With new T-shirts
we've got to perform, OK?

1046
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:13,161
Who's come to see
uncle Antonio?

1047
00:57:13,330 --> 00:57:17,369
You want a T-shirt? We don't have
one for you, you're too little.

1048
00:57:17,530 --> 00:57:20,602
Can we jerk off with a rubber?
There's less friction...

1049
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:23,489
Fuck your jerking off
and your frictions.

1050
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:25,481
What's wrong, Jorge?
Are you OK?

1051
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:29,849
Listen, remember Antonio's
tactics everybody, come on.

1052
00:57:30,010 --> 00:57:33,082
OK, you owe us 30.50 each
for the T-shirts.

1053
00:57:33,462 --> 00:57:34,497
Wasn't it 30?

1054
00:57:34,662 --> 00:57:36,141
Brazil!

1055
00:57:39,462 --> 00:57:40,611
Pass it!

1056
00:57:46,662 --> 00:57:48,061
It's the wind, man.

1057
00:57:49,582 --> 00:57:51,174
Good, that's it!

1058
00:57:51,342 --> 00:57:53,094
Good job.

1059
00:57:55,702 --> 00:57:56,578
I got it!

1060
00:58:01,982 --> 00:58:03,256
-What are you doing?
-I didn't realize.

1061
00:58:03,422 --> 00:58:05,982
-You didn't realize?
-I'll kick your ass.

1062
00:58:06,302 --> 00:58:07,576
You're not well!

1063
00:58:07,742 --> 00:58:09,380
It was my fault.

1064
00:58:09,542 --> 00:58:11,214
You're messing it up
for everyone.

1065
00:58:23,382 --> 00:58:27,295
Touch the ball again and I'll break
your legs and your mother's too.

1066
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:28,895
I know where you live.

1067
00:58:29,062 --> 00:58:29,938
-Fatso.
-What?

1068
00:58:30,262 --> 00:58:31,854
Antonio for god's sake...

1069
00:58:33,462 --> 00:58:34,895
Antonio, are you OK?

1070
00:58:38,342 --> 00:58:40,253
This is a load of shit.

1071
00:58:40,542 --> 00:58:42,498
This is not working.

1072
00:58:42,742 --> 00:58:45,779
They're messing up
my fucking therapy.

1073
00:58:45,942 --> 00:58:48,695
Listen, Antonio, you and I
are going to have to relax a bit.

1074
00:58:52,062 --> 00:58:54,053
Do you see how sad that is?

1075
00:58:55,742 --> 00:58:57,016
It's pathetic.

1076
00:59:01,422 --> 00:59:03,811
We should carry on.
We can still come 7th.

1077
00:59:03,982 --> 00:59:05,893
7th out of ten!

1078
00:59:06,062 --> 00:59:08,940
-At least we wouldn't be last.
-Stop talking shit.

1079
00:59:09,102 --> 00:59:11,058
I'm not sure either.
The problem is...

1080
00:59:11,222 --> 00:59:13,497
That's fine.
You just give up

1081
00:59:13,662 --> 00:59:16,096
and be losers for the rest
of your fucking lives.

1082
00:59:16,262 --> 00:59:20,494
Sit down, Antonio. Where are you
going? We're making progress.

1083
00:59:20,662 --> 00:59:22,573
He's right.
Don't be like Clemente.

1084
00:59:22,742 --> 00:59:26,257
What matters is playing well.
And we play well. Like Brazil.

1085
00:59:26,422 --> 00:59:29,971
Gonzalo, this dick thing
is affecting your brain.

1086
00:59:30,142 --> 00:59:32,258
Shit! The baby!

1087
00:59:32,662 --> 00:59:35,415
We left the baby on the pitch!
Fucking hell!

1088
00:59:38,102 --> 00:59:39,057
Antonio, no!

1089
00:59:40,182 --> 00:59:42,013
OK, OK, stop.

1090
00:59:50,702 --> 00:59:51,976
Let's get the kid!

1091
00:59:59,342 --> 01:00:00,616
Over there!

1092
01:00:03,102 --> 01:00:04,581
There, there. It's OK.

1093
01:00:04,982 --> 01:00:06,938
Fucking hell, Miguel.

1094
01:00:09,182 --> 01:00:10,740
There, there, there.

1095
01:00:13,982 --> 01:00:17,019
Don't let that happen again.

1096
01:00:17,502 --> 01:00:20,380
You know how traumatic
it is for him?

1097
01:00:20,662 --> 01:00:23,256
I should abandon you somewhere
and see how you feel.

1098
01:00:23,982 --> 01:00:26,212
-Unbelievable. Some father.
-It's OK, shit.

1099
01:00:27,422 --> 01:00:29,333
Shit, Miguel,
are you out of your head?

1100
01:00:29,502 --> 01:00:31,777
-All set.
-They found him.

1101
01:00:31,942 --> 01:00:35,298
-Sleeping like an angel, he was.
-We can all sit down now.

1102
01:00:35,462 --> 01:00:37,100
Who would take
such an ugly thing?

1103
01:00:37,262 --> 01:00:40,334
That's just bad luck.
Well that's great. Bye now.

1104
01:00:40,622 --> 01:00:43,375
My movie's put back
because they can't find a pig.

1105
01:00:43,542 --> 01:00:44,975
What do you mean a pig?

1106
01:00:45,142 --> 01:00:48,054
A trained piglet has a part
in the movie.

1107
01:00:48,222 --> 01:00:50,178
They can't find a pig in Spain?

1108
01:00:50,422 --> 01:00:53,334
Now it's the pig.
Six months ago the Catalonian model

1109
01:00:53,502 --> 01:00:56,062
who couldn't do a Russian accent.

1110
01:00:56,222 --> 01:00:58,178
Do you know how big
the problem is?

1111
01:00:58,342 --> 01:01:02,540
Spanish cinema is at a standstill.
TV networks don't buy movies.

1112
01:01:02,702 --> 01:01:04,932
-Have you done a pooh-pooh?
-Who's producing it?

1113
01:01:05,102 --> 01:01:07,536
-Jorge, help me out.
-"Poliedro Productions."

1114
01:01:07,702 --> 01:01:10,774
I worked with them,
but they weren't professional

1115
01:01:10,942 --> 01:01:13,376
enough for me.
But I might be able to help

1116
01:01:13,542 --> 01:01:16,136
that shitty career of yours.

1117
01:01:16,302 --> 01:01:19,658
Shitty?
What are you talking about?

1118
01:01:20,502 --> 01:01:22,413
The girl from the dry cleaner's
called me.

1119
01:01:22,582 --> 01:01:23,378
And?

1120
01:01:23,662 --> 01:01:26,335
I told her I had things to do...

1121
01:01:29,062 --> 01:01:30,177
What's wrong?

1122
01:01:31,022 --> 01:01:32,171
Nothing.

1123
01:01:32,382 --> 01:01:34,418
-Miguel...
-What?

1124
01:01:34,862 --> 01:01:37,535
He needs... it's...

1125
01:01:38,182 --> 01:01:40,059
This is what doctors call

1126
01:01:40,222 --> 01:01:41,371
a micro-penis.

1127
01:01:41,782 --> 01:01:43,420
Hello, sorry I'm late.

1128
01:01:43,582 --> 01:01:46,142
Violeta's boyfriend goes cross-eyed
whenever they shag.

1129
01:01:46,302 --> 01:01:48,497
Only in one eye.
It's executive stress.

1130
01:01:48,662 --> 01:01:51,222
Stress?
And what's wrong with you?

1131
01:01:51,382 --> 01:01:52,371
Ramón.

1132
01:01:52,622 --> 01:01:53,941
What about him?

1133
01:01:54,782 --> 01:01:56,693
He doesn't want...

1134
01:01:57,102 --> 01:02:01,573
and it's probably my fault
because I know so little...

1135
01:02:01,742 --> 01:02:04,302
not because I'm pregnant.
You can hardly tell.

1136
01:02:04,462 --> 01:02:08,057
Not at all. Just touching Ramón
is enough. He's always horny.

1137
01:02:08,222 --> 01:02:09,814
You're so sensitive.

1138
01:02:09,982 --> 01:02:12,655
You're the big expert.
What should I do?

1139
01:02:12,822 --> 01:02:13,937
I don't know.

1140
01:02:14,302 --> 01:02:16,736
Handcuff him,
or mop the house in underwear...

1141
01:02:16,902 --> 01:02:19,894
Are you retarded?
Clean the house in her underwear?

1142
01:02:20,062 --> 01:02:23,577
They love that. I don't know why,
but porno-maids get them going.

1143
01:02:23,742 --> 01:02:25,653
Don't even think about it.

1144
01:02:25,822 --> 01:02:28,700
She wouldn't suggest it
if it didn't work.

1145
01:02:28,862 --> 01:02:31,251
-That explains your success story.
-What?

1146
01:02:31,422 --> 01:02:33,856
One's got the shits
and the other's cross-eyed.

1147
01:02:34,022 --> 01:02:36,775
You haven't got a fucking clue
about love.

1148
01:02:38,902 --> 01:02:41,621
Shit, Patricia,
it's only the one eye.

1149
01:02:41,782 --> 01:02:45,570
He puts the glasses on
and everything's fine. With time...

1150
01:02:45,742 --> 01:02:48,302
The only thing that happens
with time is things get worse.

1151
01:02:49,102 --> 01:02:51,058
If I have to dress up,

1152
01:02:51,222 --> 01:02:54,578
I'll fucking well dress up,
but what as?

1153
01:02:54,742 --> 01:02:56,937
-Don't ask me.
-As a teacher, as a nurse...

1154
01:02:57,102 --> 01:02:59,900
Look, it's dumbo.
What do you want now?

1155
01:03:00,062 --> 01:03:01,461
I'm busy.

1156
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:03,738
What?

1157
01:03:08,982 --> 01:03:10,131
Miguel.

1158
01:03:10,622 --> 01:03:12,214
Antonio, don't worry.

1159
01:03:12,382 --> 01:03:14,657
It could happen to anyone.
All kids look alike.

1160
01:03:14,822 --> 01:03:15,937
You retard, I'll kill you!

1161
01:03:16,102 --> 01:03:18,013
-I didn't mean to.
-You didn't mean to?

1162
01:03:18,182 --> 01:03:20,457
-It was a mistake.
-It wasn't on purpose.

1163
01:03:20,622 --> 01:03:23,056
If he doesn't turn up,
I'll kill you all!

1164
01:03:23,222 --> 01:03:25,975
Let's not worry,
the kid can't have gone far.

1165
01:03:26,182 --> 01:03:27,820
Make another joke, asshole.

1166
01:03:27,982 --> 01:03:29,574
-Retard.
-Idiot.

1167
01:03:35,822 --> 01:03:37,892
Don't worry, we'll find him.

1168
01:03:40,062 --> 01:03:42,496
-García, any news?
-Nothing yet.

1169
01:03:43,102 --> 01:03:45,218
Well, go and fucking look.

1170
01:03:47,182 --> 01:03:48,501
-Hi.
-Hi.

1171
01:03:55,222 --> 01:03:57,656
-How are you?
-Fine, what about you?

1172
01:03:57,822 --> 01:03:58,732
Fine.

1173
01:04:01,422 --> 01:04:03,378
You haven't picked up your stuff.

1174
01:04:03,542 --> 01:04:05,817
No, I thought I'd do it
this weekend.

1175
01:04:05,982 --> 01:04:08,371
-No, I don't mind...
-I'll come by.

1176
01:04:08,542 --> 01:04:11,852
-Really, Jorge, it's OK.
-lf it's in the way...

1177
01:04:15,382 --> 01:04:16,497
Miguel.

1178
01:04:18,782 --> 01:04:20,534
You see? There he is.

1179
01:04:21,342 --> 01:04:24,857
-They're identical.
-Sorry, I was really worried.

1180
01:04:28,702 --> 01:04:31,580
Sure you don't mind?
I can sleep in the living room.

1181
01:04:31,862 --> 01:04:35,218
No, not with your bad back.
Come on, get in.

1182
01:04:35,702 --> 01:04:37,294
Cover yourself up.

1183
01:04:37,902 --> 01:04:39,858
Sure you don't want any dinner?

1184
01:04:40,022 --> 01:04:42,411
No, thanks. I'm not hungry.

1185
01:04:46,302 --> 01:04:49,021
This room is Carlos'
grandma's room, isn't it?

1186
01:04:49,542 --> 01:04:51,498
You mean the smell?

1187
01:04:52,342 --> 01:04:55,095
Yeah, leftovers, animals...

1188
01:04:55,262 --> 01:04:59,858
I clean it every day, I swear.
But it's hard to get rid of.

1189
01:05:01,182 --> 01:05:03,742
-The mattress...
-Pablito's got a parrot.

1190
01:05:04,582 --> 01:05:07,779
Miguel, please,
don't be sad. We're fine.

1191
01:05:07,942 --> 01:05:09,534
-Please.
-I don't know.

1192
01:05:10,262 --> 01:05:12,173
Underneath I was expecting this.

1193
01:05:12,342 --> 01:05:15,015
The baby thing was a mistake,
but it was no big deal.

1194
01:05:15,262 --> 01:05:16,934
It's just that...

1195
01:05:17,982 --> 01:05:19,654
I can do nothing right.

1196
01:05:20,022 --> 01:05:21,694
Patricia has never loved me.

1197
01:05:21,862 --> 01:05:24,774
Of course she loves you.
Why else marry you?

1198
01:05:24,942 --> 01:05:27,502
Because she was pregnant.

1199
01:05:29,702 --> 01:05:31,533
You sleep with the radio on?

1200
01:05:31,702 --> 01:05:33,738
Yeah, lately.
Shall I turn it off?

1201
01:05:33,902 --> 01:05:34,732
No, I like it.

1202
01:05:37,822 --> 01:05:39,096
Shall we turn off the light?

1203
01:05:47,942 --> 01:05:49,091
Good night.

1204
01:05:59,582 --> 01:06:00,571
Sheep.

1205
01:06:00,742 --> 01:06:01,652
What?

1206
01:06:01,822 --> 01:06:03,016
The smell.

1207
01:06:03,542 --> 01:06:05,134
It smells of sick sheep.

1208
01:06:06,182 --> 01:06:07,774
Could be.

1209
01:06:10,582 --> 01:06:12,493
Life is tiring.

1210
01:06:23,382 --> 01:06:24,292
Hello.

1211
01:06:24,582 --> 01:06:25,901
What are you doing?

1212
01:06:26,382 --> 01:06:27,974
A bit of cleaning.

1213
01:06:28,582 --> 01:06:30,300
You clean stark naked?

1214
01:06:30,742 --> 01:06:32,892
What? Don't you like it?

1215
01:06:33,542 --> 01:06:35,931
Shall I give you a dusting?

1216
01:06:36,942 --> 01:06:38,216
Dusting?

1217
01:06:40,222 --> 01:06:41,496
Dusting...

1218
01:06:55,182 --> 01:06:56,774
Did you think of me?

1219
01:06:57,702 --> 01:07:00,296
Heaps. And you of me?

1220
01:07:00,542 --> 01:07:01,657
Loads.

1221
01:07:03,702 --> 01:07:05,294
What did you think?

1222
01:07:07,702 --> 01:07:09,294
That I loved you.

1223
01:07:09,542 --> 01:07:10,770
Same as me.

1224
01:07:11,702 --> 01:07:13,932
I also thought of other things.

1225
01:07:14,262 --> 01:07:15,456
Me too.

1226
01:07:17,262 --> 01:07:20,095
You might change
when you're a psychologist.

1227
01:07:20,262 --> 01:07:22,696
I'll bore you.
I didn't even finish my training.

1228
01:07:22,862 --> 01:07:24,693
That'll never happen.

1229
01:07:24,862 --> 01:07:29,458
You're the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

1230
01:07:31,022 --> 01:07:34,731
I'm really sorry about everything.
I wish I could go like that

1231
01:07:35,982 --> 01:07:37,620
and rub it all out.

1232
01:07:41,222 --> 01:07:42,337
Now...

1233
01:07:45,942 --> 01:07:48,820
Now with the cab

1234
01:07:49,782 --> 01:07:54,298
I'm making 7,000 pesetas a day,

1235
01:07:55,302 --> 01:07:56,417
and...

1236
01:07:57,582 --> 01:08:01,097
with your wage it adds up
to quite a lot, doesn't it?

1237
01:08:06,022 --> 01:08:08,252
Do you want to marry me?

1238
01:08:14,582 --> 01:08:15,537
Yes?

1239
01:08:25,342 --> 01:08:26,661
I'm getting married.

1240
01:08:29,102 --> 01:08:31,013
I'm marrying Macarena.

1241
01:08:32,142 --> 01:08:34,861
Antonio!
You had me worried!

1242
01:08:35,142 --> 01:08:38,020
That's it, Antonio.
No to crazy things, yes to marriage.

1243
01:08:38,342 --> 01:08:41,061
-Have you thought it through?
-Sure he has!

1244
01:08:41,222 --> 01:08:43,816
-And his decision is sacred.
-When's the wedding?

1245
01:08:43,982 --> 01:08:46,212
-Next month.
-On the 22nd.

1246
01:08:47,502 --> 01:08:49,140
That soon?

1247
01:08:49,302 --> 01:08:51,372
Sera got me in on
the parish lists.

1248
01:08:51,542 --> 01:08:54,010
I'm impulsive with these things.
I'm a kamikaze.

1249
01:08:54,182 --> 01:08:55,774
What matters is getting married.

1250
01:08:55,942 --> 01:08:58,661
With the taxi and this
you're on the right road.

1251
01:08:58,822 --> 01:09:00,733
But Jorge, please,
forget about my sister.

1252
01:09:00,902 --> 01:09:03,177
-Don't start Antonio.
-No, don't you start.

1253
01:09:03,342 --> 01:09:07,540
Miguel, I hope you'll sing a song
at the wedding.

1254
01:09:07,702 --> 01:09:10,421
But one you like.
Not that pedestrian song.

1255
01:09:10,582 --> 01:09:11,571
But I can't...

1256
01:09:11,742 --> 01:09:12,492
Bárbara?

1257
01:09:13,822 --> 01:09:14,777
Dinner?

1258
01:09:14,942 --> 01:09:17,058
-Tell her to bring a friend.
-I can't.

1259
01:09:17,222 --> 01:09:18,496
I can't because...

1260
01:09:19,382 --> 01:09:22,135
Yes, he's going, that's right.

1261
01:09:22,302 --> 01:09:24,691
-I said no!
-Eleven?

1262
01:09:24,902 --> 01:09:26,051
What are you doing?

1263
01:09:26,222 --> 01:09:28,816
Lorena too...

1264
01:09:30,902 --> 01:09:32,017
OK. Goodbye.

1265
01:09:32,182 --> 01:09:33,854
I'm not going. I'm not...

1266
01:09:36,462 --> 01:09:38,293
Give me the phone.

1267
01:09:38,462 --> 01:09:41,215
Carlos, what are you doing?

1268
01:09:41,382 --> 01:09:45,421
What happened about the movie?
Did you find a pig?

1269
01:09:45,582 --> 01:09:47,857
-No, no such luck.
-Come on.

1270
01:09:48,022 --> 01:09:50,855
You see? Loads of them.

1271
01:09:51,062 --> 01:09:52,859
That one looks like
my father-in-law!

1272
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:55,411
Check their faces.
Pick the smartest one.

1273
01:09:55,582 --> 01:09:57,493
How can we tell?
Shall we test its IQ?

1274
01:09:57,662 --> 01:10:00,256
-Look for the gleam in its eyes.
-Eyes on the pigs please.

1275
01:10:00,422 --> 01:10:02,253
This is going to sort Charly out.

1276
01:10:02,422 --> 01:10:05,380
-Look at that shrewd little one.
-Does this pay well?

1277
01:10:05,542 --> 01:10:06,372
Sure.

1278
01:10:06,542 --> 01:10:10,137
Leave it to me,
you'll have a fairy-tale wedding.

1279
01:10:10,302 --> 01:10:12,213
-Look at the pigs.
-OK. Let's see.

1280
01:10:12,622 --> 01:10:14,055
Look. I like that one.

1281
01:10:14,222 --> 01:10:15,814
-Which one?
-With the red mark.

1282
01:10:15,982 --> 01:10:17,097
I'll get him.

1283
01:10:17,422 --> 01:10:19,856
-He looks retarded.
-Give him a chance!

1284
01:10:20,022 --> 01:10:24,015
His eyes are close together.
He looks sick. Leave him there.

1285
01:10:24,302 --> 01:10:27,374
-Leave him there.
-Please come here a moment.

1286
01:10:28,782 --> 01:10:30,852
Don't get lost now
for god's sake.

1287
01:10:32,702 --> 01:10:34,772
I don't trust Ramón.
I didn't want him here.

1288
01:10:34,942 --> 01:10:37,172
We need him here
in case there's trouble.

1289
01:10:37,342 --> 01:10:40,379
He needs our help. His father-in-law
always does everything for him.

1290
01:10:40,542 --> 01:10:43,500
Will your cousin
know how to train them?

1291
01:10:43,662 --> 01:10:48,019
He has a way with animals.
You remember the pony...

1292
01:10:48,182 --> 01:10:51,219
There. The one that looks like
my father-in-law.

1293
01:10:51,462 --> 01:10:55,137
This one's definitely got
an idiotic face on it.

1294
01:10:57,422 --> 01:10:58,571
That one, that one.

1295
01:10:58,742 --> 01:10:59,652
That one!

1296
01:10:59,822 --> 01:11:02,700
-He's a cripple for god's sake.
-Is the pig going to dance?

1297
01:11:02,862 --> 01:11:04,454
What's going on there?

1298
01:11:04,702 --> 01:11:05,976
Run!

1299
01:11:08,702 --> 01:11:11,580
This fucker weighs a ton!

1300
01:11:11,742 --> 01:11:12,731
Run, Antonio!

1301
01:11:13,702 --> 01:11:15,181
-Antonio!
-Come on!

1302
01:11:16,582 --> 01:11:19,016
Let's go, move it!

1303
01:11:21,422 --> 01:11:22,571
Here!

1304
01:11:22,782 --> 01:11:24,738
Start the car, man!

1305
01:11:25,062 --> 01:11:26,495
Start the car!

1306
01:11:27,222 --> 01:11:28,860
Here he comes!

1307
01:11:37,982 --> 01:11:39,654
Sit down, Manolito.

1308
01:11:40,182 --> 01:11:40,978
Look.

1309
01:11:41,342 --> 01:11:43,617
He was about to sit down there.

1310
01:11:43,782 --> 01:11:47,775
The little bastard understands
everything. He's being a rebel.

1311
01:11:49,622 --> 01:11:50,896
Listen, Julián.

1312
01:11:51,782 --> 01:11:54,979
The pig has to do things,
it has to...

1313
01:11:56,422 --> 01:11:57,741
What's that?

1314
01:11:58,182 --> 01:12:02,778
The billygoat,
it's got to do somersaults...

1315
01:12:03,582 --> 01:12:05,015
That's nothing.

1316
01:12:05,302 --> 01:12:08,021
He'll end up reading.
Clever little son of a bitch.

1317
01:12:08,182 --> 01:12:09,217
OK Julián.

1318
01:12:09,382 --> 01:12:10,417
Have you ever done this?

1319
01:12:12,022 --> 01:12:16,061
A dog, I had to...
one crazy dog.

1320
01:12:16,222 --> 01:12:18,133
A dog isn't a swine
for god's sake!

1321
01:12:18,302 --> 01:12:20,372
Keep going, Ramón.

1322
01:12:20,542 --> 01:12:23,102
I've been wanting to punch
your face in for two weeks now.

1323
01:12:23,262 --> 01:12:25,651
-Come on, cut the punches.
-Take it easy.

1324
01:12:25,822 --> 01:12:29,451
Sera, this is important.
There's a lot of dough involved.

1325
01:12:29,622 --> 01:12:33,092
I'm getting married, he's having
a kid and there's Carlos' movie.

1326
01:12:33,262 --> 01:12:35,139
-Are you doubting me?
-No, I'm not.

1327
01:12:35,742 --> 01:12:38,131
This is Félix Rodríguez
de la Fuente.

1328
01:12:38,302 --> 01:12:41,738
He has a gift. A gift.
Didn't you see

1329
01:12:41,902 --> 01:12:45,417
that sad look on the pig's face
in the car? Look at him now.

1330
01:12:46,102 --> 01:12:48,058
He's laughing, the bastard.

1331
01:12:49,062 --> 01:12:50,859
Funny little fucker.

1332
01:12:51,022 --> 01:12:53,582
He'll be the piglet version
of Lassie.

1333
01:12:55,142 --> 01:12:56,097
What the...

1334
01:12:56,262 --> 01:12:59,777
I'm not going. We can have
a quiet night and read a bit...

1335
01:12:59,942 --> 01:13:02,172
-Make another tortilla.
-I'm not going.

1336
01:13:02,342 --> 01:13:05,857
It's easy for you Carlos,
I haven't dated in 9 years.

1337
01:13:06,022 --> 01:13:06,932
With onion?

1338
01:13:07,102 --> 01:13:11,300
Stop making omelettes.
Jorge, you are going. You're tense.

1339
01:13:11,462 --> 01:13:13,293
And what's best for tension?

1340
01:13:13,462 --> 01:13:14,895
-Sex.
-Sex.

1341
01:13:15,342 --> 01:13:17,492
Jorge, let's go over it again.

1342
01:13:17,662 --> 01:13:20,540
You're having dinner
in a restaurant.

1343
01:13:20,702 --> 01:13:24,331
Don't let her see you want
to screw her, or you never will.

1344
01:13:24,502 --> 01:13:27,858
"I don't want to...
No baby... Not now..."

1345
01:13:28,022 --> 01:13:30,695
You ask for wine
and make her drink.

1346
01:13:30,862 --> 01:13:32,773
What do I say meanwhile?

1347
01:13:32,942 --> 01:13:34,580
Make her drink.
After dinner.

1348
01:13:34,742 --> 01:13:35,731
And then?

1349
01:13:35,902 --> 01:13:38,336
-A café, something interesting.
-What do I say?

1350
01:13:38,502 --> 01:13:40,732
It's obvious.
Make her drink.

1351
01:13:41,222 --> 01:13:42,655
Miguel, what do I do?

1352
01:13:42,822 --> 01:13:45,211
After the café take her to a bar
and make her drink.

1353
01:13:45,382 --> 01:13:46,974
-Mistake.
-Mistake.

1354
01:13:47,142 --> 01:13:50,771
Let her drink, but not too much.
Because then what happens?

1355
01:13:50,942 --> 01:13:52,534
We've got a plan.

1356
01:13:52,702 --> 01:13:56,092
You'll bring her here
to show her your drawings.

1357
01:13:56,262 --> 01:13:58,856
I don't draw.
That's it, I can't go.

1358
01:13:59,022 --> 01:14:02,059
No matter. You can hypnotize her
with my guitar.

1359
01:14:02,222 --> 01:14:05,817
Yeah! None of that
romantic stuff, Charly.

1360
01:14:06,022 --> 01:14:09,412
I'm not going, relax!
What are you doing?

1361
01:14:10,022 --> 01:14:11,137
What's that?

1362
01:14:11,302 --> 01:14:13,418
What's that?
A hand, a hand.

1363
01:14:13,742 --> 01:14:16,017
What does your hand do?
Jerk you off.

1364
01:14:16,182 --> 01:14:17,297
My drawings.

1365
01:14:17,462 --> 01:14:20,374
You'll show her my drawings.
I do some painting.

1366
01:14:20,542 --> 01:14:21,657
Will that work?

1367
01:14:21,822 --> 01:14:24,700
You'll see tomorrow when he wakes up
with his balls drained.

1368
01:14:24,862 --> 01:14:26,136
Of course it works.

1369
01:14:26,382 --> 01:14:28,976
The stranger the lie
the less people believe you.

1370
01:14:29,142 --> 01:14:31,702
Lie with style.
You'll fuck her, Jorge.

1371
01:14:31,862 --> 01:14:32,977
I am horny...

1372
01:14:33,142 --> 01:14:34,939
-What about the drawing bit?
-Shut up.

1373
01:14:35,102 --> 01:14:37,570
You're going to fuck her.

1374
01:14:37,742 --> 01:14:40,859
I'll dress you up, comb your hair
and you'll fuck her.

1375
01:14:41,022 --> 01:14:44,139
Repeat after me:
"I'm going to fuck her."

1376
01:14:44,782 --> 01:14:48,661
"I'm going to fuck her."
You're going to fuck her.

1377
01:14:48,982 --> 01:14:52,019
<i>You're going to fuck her...</i>

1378
01:14:52,182 --> 01:14:53,774
<i>Fuck... fuck...</i>

1379
01:14:57,182 --> 01:14:58,092
Are you OK?

1380
01:14:59,262 --> 01:15:00,377
Great, wonderful.

1381
01:15:00,542 --> 01:15:03,614
I feel just fine, just fine.

1382
01:15:03,782 --> 01:15:07,616
Please, have some wine.
I thought that after dinner

1383
01:15:07,782 --> 01:15:11,377
we could go to a café.

1384
01:15:11,822 --> 01:15:14,017
A nearby café.

1385
01:15:14,862 --> 01:15:18,457
Did you know I like to draw?

1386
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:24,141
They, they...
I'm mixing one thing with another.

1387
01:15:26,302 --> 01:15:27,212
More wine?

1388
01:15:27,742 --> 01:15:28,652
I mean,

1389
01:15:30,462 --> 01:15:34,819
I've always had this love

1390
01:15:35,382 --> 01:15:37,771
of snatching up a piece of paper

1391
01:15:37,942 --> 01:15:40,331
and with four strokes
creating a face...

1392
01:15:40,502 --> 01:15:42,891
a forest, birds in flight...

1393
01:15:46,702 --> 01:15:48,658
So the thing is,

1394
01:15:48,822 --> 01:15:52,781
I've got a portfolio at home

1395
01:15:52,942 --> 01:15:57,333
that you might like
to have a peek at.

1396
01:15:58,982 --> 01:16:01,371
You might like that.

1397
01:16:02,822 --> 01:16:04,414
Don't you like drawing?

1398
01:16:08,582 --> 01:16:09,810
Have some wine.

1399
01:16:10,182 --> 01:16:12,696
Charly, she doesn't like drawing.
I'm going.

1400
01:16:12,862 --> 01:16:14,932
Don't you come here.
What?

1401
01:16:15,302 --> 01:16:16,291
What?

1402
01:16:16,462 --> 01:16:17,417
Cinema.

1403
01:16:17,862 --> 01:16:20,456
You must like movies
because everyone does.

1404
01:16:20,622 --> 01:16:23,978
The thing is I've got
a Dolby system at home,

1405
01:16:24,142 --> 01:16:27,179
DVD with Dolby.

1406
01:16:27,702 --> 01:16:30,694
It's hard to explain right now,

1407
01:16:30,862 --> 01:16:34,218
but it's like having it behind you,
on both sides, in front...

1408
01:16:35,582 --> 01:16:39,780
So in space movies
it's as if the spacecraft is...

1409
01:16:40,462 --> 01:16:43,454
-and horses in cavalry movies...
-Jorge, shut up.

1410
01:16:43,622 --> 01:16:46,011
You've been talking crap
all night.

1411
01:16:46,182 --> 01:16:48,935
Let's see, I'm a woman,

1412
01:16:49,422 --> 01:16:51,982
can you see that?
With a pair of tits,

1413
01:16:52,142 --> 01:16:53,814
which are practically

1414
01:16:53,982 --> 01:16:55,620
invisible to you.

1415
01:16:55,782 --> 01:16:58,057
And you are a man
with your bits.

1416
01:16:58,222 --> 01:17:01,453
Well that's it, let's have fun,
play around.

1417
01:17:02,102 --> 01:17:04,491
Jorge, I have no idea why,

1418
01:17:04,662 --> 01:17:06,095
but you get me really horny.

1419
01:17:07,822 --> 01:17:08,937
I want to fuck you.

1420
01:17:09,382 --> 01:17:10,701
Do you want to fuck me?

1421
01:17:11,702 --> 01:17:13,135
Well no... Yes.

1422
01:17:13,342 --> 01:17:17,221
Please say it. I can't take it
any more, you're doing my head in:

1423
01:17:17,382 --> 01:17:18,531
"Yes, I want to fuck you."

1424
01:17:19,582 --> 01:17:20,458
Drink!

1425
01:17:24,822 --> 01:17:25,937
Again!

1426
01:17:28,342 --> 01:17:29,297
Jorge,

1427
01:17:29,862 --> 01:17:31,534
I want wild sex with you.

1428
01:17:31,702 --> 01:17:34,262
-I want wild sex with you.
-Well done.

1429
01:17:34,662 --> 01:17:35,572
Drink.

1430
01:17:40,982 --> 01:17:42,620
-Wait.
-What?

1431
01:17:44,342 --> 01:17:46,458
-Already?
-No, no.

1432
01:18:16,262 --> 01:18:19,493
I don't want him to do
acrobatics or somersaults,

1433
01:18:19,662 --> 01:18:23,371
or even sit down,
just when you call him...

1434
01:18:23,822 --> 01:18:25,255
Boom, he comes.

1435
01:18:25,422 --> 01:18:29,973
Don't worry, he will. He got
the pony in town to do cartwheels.

1436
01:18:36,942 --> 01:18:38,534
-Here.
-Thanks.

1437
01:18:41,142 --> 01:18:42,291
He tripped him!

1438
01:18:54,382 --> 01:18:55,337
Gonzalo!

1439
01:18:55,862 --> 01:18:56,817
Gonzalo!

1440
01:18:57,222 --> 01:18:58,337
Gonzalo!

1441
01:18:59,742 --> 01:19:01,175
The money.

1442
01:19:01,342 --> 01:19:03,731
The money or I'll kill you!

1443
01:19:03,902 --> 01:19:07,417
I'll rip off your moustache,
you asshole!

1444
01:19:08,222 --> 01:19:11,578
-This is what gets to me.
-Relax, I got it back.

1445
01:19:13,342 --> 01:19:15,298
Manolito, "come here."

1446
01:19:16,462 --> 01:19:18,259
I speak English to him.

1447
01:19:18,422 --> 01:19:21,937
In Spanish,
speak to him in Spanish.

1448
01:19:22,102 --> 01:19:24,491
Animal psychology
is to be applied in English.

1449
01:19:24,662 --> 01:19:27,051
Psychology my foot.

1450
01:19:45,142 --> 01:19:46,257
Go Brazil!

1451
01:19:46,822 --> 01:19:48,778
It has a cold, septic side.

1452
01:19:48,942 --> 01:19:52,571
A vertical tendency
that represents man's angst

1453
01:19:52,742 --> 01:19:54,698
and his desire to reach higher...

1454
01:19:57,462 --> 01:19:59,657
If we cover this area...

1455
01:19:59,822 --> 01:20:03,053
Miguel, this is a load of shit.

1456
01:20:03,222 --> 01:20:05,178
All of it.

1457
01:20:09,102 --> 01:20:11,821
No, the first one
who gets near you...

1458
01:20:12,182 --> 01:20:13,297
in the ass.

1459
01:20:15,582 --> 01:20:17,015
What are you doing?

1460
01:20:19,702 --> 01:20:21,135
Please!

1461
01:20:22,902 --> 01:20:24,051
Please!

1462
01:20:33,582 --> 01:20:35,698
Hey, what is it?

1463
01:20:45,102 --> 01:20:47,332
-He's useless.
-Kill the pig.

1464
01:20:51,822 --> 01:20:53,938
Look, he went right to him!

1465
01:20:55,542 --> 01:20:56,861
No he didn't!

1466
01:21:00,862 --> 01:21:02,181
Seven more.

1467
01:21:03,462 --> 01:21:06,101
You must have some problem
worth mentioning.

1468
01:21:06,822 --> 01:21:08,858
Just let it out.

1469
01:21:09,902 --> 01:21:12,018
<i>"Dear professor:</i>
<i>I am writing</i>

1470
01:21:12,182 --> 01:21:15,458
<i>to ask you kindly and for your own</i>
<i>good to make sure your student</i>

1471
01:21:15,622 --> 01:21:18,739
<i>Gonzalo Pascual graduates.</i>
<i>If you don't, we will be obliged</i>

1472
01:21:18,902 --> 01:21:21,541

1473
01:21:21,702 --> 01:21:25,411
<i>-What matters most.</i>
<i>-Exactly, what matters most.</i>

1474
01:21:25,662 --> 01:21:28,699
<i>"We know where you live</i>
<i>and where your kids go to school.</i>

1475
01:21:28,862 --> 01:21:31,581
<i>-Yours sincerely, anonymous.</i>
<i>-P.S.</i>

1476
01:21:32,142 --> 01:21:33,461
<i>Make it a B.</i> "

1477
01:21:33,622 --> 01:21:34,577
B

1478
01:21:44,942 --> 01:21:46,660
Jorge, please, relax.

1479
01:21:47,662 --> 01:21:50,460
Every time I look up
he's staring at me,

1480
01:21:50,622 --> 01:21:52,738
his eyes are burning into me.

1481
01:21:52,902 --> 01:21:56,736
I'm convinced he wants me to work
with my nose on the desk.

1482
01:21:57,142 --> 01:21:59,940
But any day now I'm going
to stand up to him and say:

1483
01:22:00,102 --> 01:22:02,093
"Look, asshole.

1484
01:22:02,862 --> 01:22:05,899
You can take the job
and shove it up your ass."

1485
01:22:06,062 --> 01:22:07,495
What are you going to say?

1486
01:22:07,942 --> 01:22:09,216
"Shove the job...

1487
01:22:14,302 --> 01:22:15,781
I can't take any more."

1488
01:22:16,262 --> 01:22:17,411
Of what?

1489
01:22:18,222 --> 01:22:20,975
Of life.
Shall I order the tiramisu?

1490
01:22:22,102 --> 01:22:23,581
Jorge, let's go.

1491
01:22:24,182 --> 01:22:25,376
Yeah, forget dessert.

1492
01:22:25,542 --> 01:22:26,975
Let's leave Madrid.

1493
01:22:27,662 --> 01:22:28,936
In the holidays?

1494
01:22:29,102 --> 01:22:30,217
No, now.

1495
01:22:32,022 --> 01:22:33,137
But where?

1496
01:22:33,942 --> 01:22:36,376
Who cares? Where ever.
Far away.

1497
01:22:36,542 --> 01:22:37,770
For how long?

1498
01:22:38,142 --> 01:22:39,814
It doesn't matter.

1499
01:22:40,862 --> 01:22:43,535
But Bárbara, I have a job.
At 6:15

1500
01:22:43,702 --> 01:22:46,933
-my alarm clock goes off...
-Fuck your job.

1501
01:22:47,262 --> 01:22:48,411
Let's go.

1502
01:22:49,302 --> 01:22:51,577
No crazy stuff please.

1503
01:22:51,742 --> 01:22:53,698
I've got a job, responsibilities.

1504
01:22:53,862 --> 01:22:55,818
My friend Antonio's
wedding Saturday...

1505
01:22:55,982 --> 01:22:57,620
And the last league match.

1506
01:22:57,782 --> 01:22:59,693
-Don't confuse me.
-OK, we'll do this:

1507
01:22:59,862 --> 01:23:02,501
Saturday when you finish
I'll pick you up,

1508
01:23:02,662 --> 01:23:05,654
we catch a train, any train,
and we're off.

1509
01:23:07,022 --> 01:23:08,933
Jorge, I've thought it through.

1510
01:23:09,102 --> 01:23:12,333
I'm fed up with the dry cleaner's
and the neighborhood. I'm leaving.

1511
01:23:13,382 --> 01:23:15,452
I'd like it if you came with me.

1512
01:23:18,622 --> 01:23:20,533
You know what I'm going to do now?

1513
01:23:22,222 --> 01:23:23,496
Don't write on that.

1514
01:23:25,902 --> 01:23:27,017
I feel like it.

1515
01:23:27,942 --> 01:23:29,261
SUCK YOU OFF

1516
01:23:29,942 --> 01:23:32,502
No, Bárbara, no.

1517
01:23:33,902 --> 01:23:35,051
It turns me on.

1518
01:23:35,382 --> 01:23:36,178
No.

1519
01:23:36,782 --> 01:23:37,578
No.

1520
01:23:38,062 --> 01:23:41,452
Come out from under there.
Come on.

1521
01:23:42,062 --> 01:23:43,973
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

1522
01:23:52,822 --> 01:23:54,733
-Hi.
-Hi. How are you?

1523
01:23:55,382 --> 01:23:58,419
Very well.
I'm having dinner here alone.

1524
01:23:58,782 --> 01:24:01,171
There's a glass for everyone
these days.

1525
01:24:03,262 --> 01:24:05,696
Yeah, these modern restaurants...

1526
01:24:06,582 --> 01:24:08,015
Jorge, Daniel.

1527
01:24:08,182 --> 01:24:08,978
Jorge.

1528
01:24:10,422 --> 01:24:12,060
What a situation!

1529
01:24:12,222 --> 01:24:14,941
My ossobucco's coming up...

1530
01:24:18,302 --> 01:24:20,258
Isn't the wedding a surprise?

1531
01:24:20,422 --> 01:24:21,537
Wedding?

1532
01:24:21,702 --> 01:24:24,421
-Yes.
-Antonio's wedding! Unbelievable.

1533
01:24:30,382 --> 01:24:32,816
Well, we'll go and sit down.

1534
01:24:33,222 --> 01:24:34,575
-Here or...
-No, there.

1535
01:24:35,982 --> 01:24:38,371
-We've got a table.
-Fine, no problem.

1536
01:24:38,542 --> 01:24:40,772
Nice to meet you.

1537
01:24:44,382 --> 01:24:45,371
Hey, man...

1538
01:24:46,782 --> 01:24:48,374
That ossobucco!

1539
01:24:56,782 --> 01:24:58,738
Eat up, eat up...

1540
01:25:01,942 --> 01:25:05,014
Great guy Jorge.
Is he always like that?

1541
01:25:08,822 --> 01:25:09,937
This place has great

1542
01:25:10,102 --> 01:25:11,581
-Farfalli.
-Let's go.

1543
01:25:13,342 --> 01:25:14,252
Excuse me?

1544
01:25:14,422 --> 01:25:15,616
Let's go.

1545
01:25:16,222 --> 01:25:18,975
-What about the Farfalli?
-Screw the Farfalli.

1546
01:25:19,142 --> 01:25:20,257
Fucking Farfalli!

1547
01:25:29,902 --> 01:25:32,291
I'll do the talking.
There's cash to be made.

1548
01:25:32,462 --> 01:25:34,373
Charly doesn't know
about this?

1549
01:25:34,542 --> 01:25:38,217
Nothing. He'll be so happy when
he sees we've sorted it all out.

1550
01:25:38,382 --> 01:25:40,612
Take it easy, champ.
You'll be a star.

1551
01:25:40,782 --> 01:25:42,215
Sit down, Manolito.

1552
01:25:42,382 --> 01:25:44,338
OK, that's enough.
Let him rest.

1553
01:25:44,502 --> 01:25:48,017
I've got to get some studying done.
My exam's tomorrow.

1554
01:25:48,182 --> 01:25:51,697
No problem. You need to study.
You know how it goes:

1555
01:25:51,862 --> 01:25:55,218
"Work hard, play hard." You'll have
A's coming out of your ears.

1556
01:25:55,382 --> 01:25:57,338
-Good afternoon.
-Afternoon.

1557
01:25:57,662 --> 01:25:59,573
I think there's been a mistake.

1558
01:25:59,742 --> 01:26:03,257
No mistake. I assure you
there's nothing like Manolito.

1559
01:26:03,422 --> 01:26:05,333
You should see him on film.

1560
01:26:05,502 --> 01:26:08,539
You've been misinformed. We don't
need a pig. There's no movie.

1561
01:26:08,702 --> 01:26:10,772
Wait. No movie
with Carlos Liaño?

1562
01:26:10,942 --> 01:26:12,091
Never heard of him.

1563
01:26:12,262 --> 01:26:13,854
What? Carlos Liaño.

1564
01:26:14,022 --> 01:26:16,934
-Really, I've never heard of him.
-He tricked us.

1565
01:26:17,102 --> 01:26:19,536
-Wait, are you sure?
-Absolutely.

1566
01:26:19,702 --> 01:26:21,340
Don’t joke around, OK?

1567
01:26:21,502 --> 01:26:23,732
We only make
industrial videos here.

1568
01:26:23,902 --> 01:26:25,540
Industrial videos?
What the fuck!

1569
01:26:25,702 --> 01:26:30,059
Antonio, he lied to us.
I'll kick the shit out of the pig...

1570
01:26:31,702 --> 01:26:33,658
Gentlemen, quiet please.

1571
01:26:33,822 --> 01:26:35,892
Cunning son of a bitch.

1572
01:26:36,062 --> 01:26:40,658
Carlos is one hell of an actor.
Acting all this time...

1573
01:26:41,062 --> 01:26:44,418
Don't delude yourself, a good kick
in the balls and it's over.

1574
01:26:44,582 --> 01:26:46,812
Who gets kicked in the balls?

1575
01:26:46,982 --> 01:26:51,021
Shall I punch your head in?
Will I ever get through to you?

1576
01:26:51,382 --> 01:26:53,657
Could you do a test
on the pig anyway?

1577
01:26:53,822 --> 01:26:55,938
I told you we don't need any pigs.

1578
01:26:56,102 --> 01:26:58,013
Sit down, Manolito, sit down.

1579
01:26:58,822 --> 01:27:01,734
Well, remember it's his first
job experience.

1580
01:27:01,902 --> 01:27:05,053
But even big stars go through that.
Like Francis the Donkey.

1581
01:27:05,542 --> 01:27:09,171
There are the most popular.
The quality is exceptional.

1582
01:27:09,342 --> 01:27:11,776
Yeah, but I want white napkins
and tablecloths.

1583
01:27:11,942 --> 01:27:16,413
White, traditional wedding white.
Bring me white ones, please.

1584
01:27:16,702 --> 01:27:19,170
Antonio does everything wrong.
This is no way to prepare a wedding.

1585
01:27:19,342 --> 01:27:21,776
-They'll be just fine.
-Nobody is just fine.

1586
01:27:21,942 --> 01:27:25,298
He's going to leave me.
I do what I can, but...

1587
01:27:25,622 --> 01:27:26,691
Well good.

1588
01:27:26,862 --> 01:27:29,376
Since Miguel left
I'm in heaven.

1589
01:27:29,542 --> 01:27:33,330
Now Miguel had something in his
favor, he didn't go cross-eyed.

1590
01:27:33,502 --> 01:27:37,654
-He still does that, right?
-Yes, but I...

1591
01:27:38,022 --> 01:27:40,297
I think I'm going
to leave Daniel.

1592
01:27:40,822 --> 01:27:42,619
Heard anything about Jorge?

1593
01:27:42,782 --> 01:27:46,013
Yeah, he's retarded. Forget about
Jorge and Mr. Cross-eyed.

1594
01:27:46,182 --> 01:27:49,811
This green is disgusting.
What if I set up a trio?

1595
01:27:49,982 --> 01:27:53,213
-It would work, wouldn't it?
-Please, Carla, drop it.

1596
01:27:53,382 --> 01:27:56,294
-Why not just forget it?
-Because I love him.

1597
01:27:56,462 --> 01:27:58,453
I don't know why,
but I love him.

1598
01:27:58,902 --> 01:28:01,621
Please.
What's up with you now?

1599
01:28:02,462 --> 01:28:05,852
Well, I saw Jorge the other day
in a restaurant with a girl

1600
01:28:06,422 --> 01:28:07,855
and she was...

1601
01:28:09,902 --> 01:28:11,620
sucking his...

1602
01:28:11,782 --> 01:28:13,534
How terrible, how terrible...

1603
01:28:13,702 --> 01:28:14,976
So what? So what?

1604
01:28:15,142 --> 01:28:18,691
Jorge initially wasn't like that.
He was different...

1605
01:28:18,862 --> 01:28:20,773
I think I've made a mistake.

1606
01:28:20,942 --> 01:28:23,900
Maybe getting married
wasn't such a bad idea.

1607
01:28:25,262 --> 01:28:28,379
Sometimes I could just do
with a swig of gin.

1608
01:28:47,222 --> 01:28:48,940
This isn't on the course.

1609
01:28:49,102 --> 01:28:51,332
What do you mean,
not on the course?

1610
01:28:52,622 --> 01:28:55,500
This isn't right.
It wasn't in my book.

1611
01:28:55,662 --> 01:28:57,573
I'm sorry I can't help you.

1612
01:29:01,182 --> 01:29:03,252
Who wrote these questions?

1613
01:29:05,662 --> 01:29:08,051
Tell whoever wrote these questions
to come here.

1614
01:29:08,222 --> 01:29:10,133
If you continue
I'll call security.

1615
01:29:13,062 --> 01:29:14,177
I won't budge

1616
01:29:14,342 --> 01:29:16,731
until you tell me
who wrote the questions.

1617
01:29:20,222 --> 01:29:23,419
I'm going to talk to the person
who wrote this.

1618
01:29:24,782 --> 01:29:26,500
I'm going to his office.

1619
01:29:33,062 --> 01:29:35,530
RUN OFF WITH BARBARA
ADVANTAGES - DISADVANTAGES

1620
01:29:55,302 --> 01:29:57,532
-Dad!
-Hey, tiger!

1621
01:29:57,982 --> 01:30:02,772
How's it going Antoñito?
How are you doing, man?

1622
01:30:03,142 --> 01:30:06,134
Hey! Watch the suit.
I'm fucking nervous.

1623
01:30:06,302 --> 01:30:08,372
It's the most important day
of your life.

1624
01:30:08,542 --> 01:30:10,294
You've got the rings,
haven't you?

1625
01:30:10,462 --> 01:30:12,930
I'd forget my heart
before the rings.

1626
01:30:13,102 --> 01:30:15,821
I hope this is quick.
We have a match...

1627
01:30:15,982 --> 01:30:19,179
Forget soccer, we haven't won
a match yet and we might be late.

1628
01:30:19,342 --> 01:30:21,572
Don't give me that attitude now.

1629
01:30:21,742 --> 01:30:24,176
We have time.
We're going to win today.

1630
01:30:24,342 --> 01:30:25,980
-What's that?
-Nothing.

1631
01:30:26,222 --> 01:30:28,452
-The invitation list?
-No, nothing.

1632
01:30:29,382 --> 01:30:31,612
Is there prawn cocktail
at the banquet?

1633
01:30:31,782 --> 01:30:34,376
No seafood, too expensive.
Mixed fry-up.

1634
01:30:34,542 --> 01:30:38,535
Good, that's more filling.
Can I talk to you for a minute?

1635
01:30:39,742 --> 01:30:42,654
Please. Ask me for a minute
and I'll give you my watch.

1636
01:30:42,822 --> 01:30:46,815
Here, take it. And chin up,
you've passed for god's sake.

1637
01:30:48,542 --> 01:30:51,295
Is that the tie
your mother gave you?

1638
01:30:51,462 --> 01:30:53,453
What's wrong with Antonio?

1639
01:30:56,622 --> 01:30:58,340
Shit, she's coming.

1640
01:30:59,382 --> 01:31:00,497
Here she comes.

1641
01:31:00,662 --> 01:31:02,892
It's her. Come on, come on.

1642
01:31:03,062 --> 01:31:04,973
Come on, everyone inside.

1643
01:31:05,142 --> 01:31:06,097
Jorge!

1644
01:31:09,382 --> 01:31:11,293
Please! Please!

1645
01:31:16,142 --> 01:31:18,372
Let me by,
I've got to be in there.

1646
01:31:21,342 --> 01:31:23,572
Come on Brazil,
we'll be late!

1647
01:31:26,782 --> 01:31:29,376
-Good-looking, wasn't I?
-Like an angel.

1648
01:31:38,222 --> 01:31:41,259
Come on, chin up!
You're the best.

1649
01:31:41,582 --> 01:31:43,652
This is a load of shit, Serafín.

1650
01:31:43,862 --> 01:31:46,296
What shall we do?
Listen, what shall we do?

1651
01:31:47,182 --> 01:31:48,615
What then?

1652
01:31:50,262 --> 01:31:51,377
Hey, cousin!

1653
01:31:52,182 --> 01:31:53,661
Got my sandwich!

1654
01:31:55,142 --> 01:31:58,771
-What then?
-Hang on, hang on.

1655
01:32:09,302 --> 01:32:10,940
-Where's the ref?
-He had to go.

1656
01:32:11,102 --> 01:32:13,058
What do you mean,
had to go?

1657
01:32:13,222 --> 01:32:15,656
-He had to run. Personal affair.
-His mum's ill.

1658
01:32:15,822 --> 01:32:20,213
If they protest, give them a card.
These punks are always complaining.

1659
01:32:20,382 --> 01:32:21,212
Come on!

1660
01:32:21,382 --> 01:32:24,055
-Show them you mean business.
-OK, let's go.

1661
01:32:25,062 --> 01:32:27,337
-Very strange.
-Yes, he is.

1662
01:32:29,702 --> 01:32:31,135
Over here, Ramón!

1663
01:32:32,542 --> 01:32:34,817
-Penalty!
-Blow your whistle!

1664
01:32:36,022 --> 01:32:36,932
Penalty!

1665
01:32:38,542 --> 01:32:40,453
What the hell is that?

1666
01:32:42,222 --> 01:32:44,178
Damnit, he took a dive!

1667
01:32:44,902 --> 01:32:46,017
Who did?

1668
01:32:47,822 --> 01:32:48,811
Goal!

1669
01:32:52,662 --> 01:32:53,777
Let's go!

1670
01:33:01,022 --> 01:33:04,219
You blow a foul against me?
Your cousin?

1671
01:33:04,382 --> 01:33:06,338
Change it or go back
to your village!

1672
01:33:06,502 --> 01:33:09,221
-Village? I'm from Mortalaz.
-Shut up, asshole!

1673
01:33:09,902 --> 01:33:11,813
I was wrong!
I take it back!

1674
01:33:13,862 --> 01:33:15,773
He made a mistake!

1675
01:33:21,742 --> 01:33:22,811
Back off!

1676
01:33:28,382 --> 01:33:29,701
Goal!

1677
01:33:34,142 --> 01:33:35,461
Charly, over here!

1678
01:33:36,742 --> 01:33:37,492
Shoot!

1679
01:33:40,062 --> 01:33:41,336
Goal!

1680
01:33:45,502 --> 01:33:46,332
Goal!

1681
01:33:49,422 --> 01:33:51,333
He's not throwing it in right.

1682
01:33:51,502 --> 01:33:53,140
-Foul.
-I haven't thrown it yet!

1683
01:33:53,302 --> 01:33:56,658
You were going to, I saw you.
Shut up or you get a warning!

1684
01:33:56,822 --> 01:33:58,892
-Antonio, here goes.
-Do it!

1685
01:33:59,662 --> 01:34:00,936
Here we go!

1686
01:34:08,742 --> 01:34:11,017
How can you call a penalty?

1687
01:34:13,102 --> 01:34:15,980
-I'll shoot!
-No, not you!

1688
01:34:16,542 --> 01:34:18,498
I'll shoot it so fuck you!

1689
01:34:19,062 --> 01:34:22,293
Why's he so angry with me?
What have I done?

1690
01:34:22,782 --> 01:34:24,738
Hold on,
let me talk to him.

1691
01:34:25,222 --> 01:34:27,133
-Jorge, what's up?
-I'm shooting it!

1692
01:34:27,942 --> 01:34:29,421
OK, OK.

1693
01:34:30,222 --> 01:34:31,655
But please...

1694
01:34:32,662 --> 01:34:34,334
One second, referee.

1695
01:34:34,662 --> 01:34:35,492
Please...

1696
01:34:36,022 --> 01:34:37,296
try to...

1697
01:34:37,702 --> 01:34:40,262
Just a minute, ref,
just a minute.

1698
01:34:40,862 --> 01:34:44,298
This is a moment of massive
importance in your life,

1699
01:34:44,462 --> 01:34:46,453
in mine and everyone's.

1700
01:34:47,822 --> 01:34:49,653
Keep out of this for god's sake.

1701
01:34:49,822 --> 01:34:51,972
Look at the ball and think,

1702
01:34:52,262 --> 01:34:55,698
you've got to picture it.
Your father's head.

1703
01:34:55,862 --> 01:34:59,935
Antonio, leave my father alone!
Leave my father out of it!

1704
01:35:00,702 --> 01:35:02,294
Just drop it!

1705
01:35:02,462 --> 01:35:05,340
Careful the sun's behind him,
there's a glare.

1706
01:35:07,342 --> 01:35:10,061
Imagine your father
talking to you.

1707
01:35:14,382 --> 01:35:15,974
Goal!

1708
01:35:19,342 --> 01:35:20,331
Jorge!

1709
01:35:23,622 --> 01:35:25,101
It's a goal.

1710
01:35:25,302 --> 01:35:27,099
-End the match.
-There's a minute left.

1711
01:35:27,262 --> 01:35:29,822
Do it!
Three strong whistles.

1712
01:35:32,182 --> 01:35:33,615
Time!

1713
01:35:36,502 --> 01:35:37,776
We've won!

1714
01:35:44,582 --> 01:35:46,857
Hit the showers everyone.

1715
01:35:50,022 --> 01:35:54,538
See the gleam in his eyes?
What it means to win?

1716
01:35:54,702 --> 01:35:57,262
Jorge, Jorge!

1717
01:35:57,982 --> 01:35:59,620
Fucking unbelievable.

1718
01:36:00,382 --> 01:36:01,531
Superstar!

1719
01:36:01,782 --> 01:36:04,342
This'll raise your spirits,
you'll see.

1720
01:36:04,502 --> 01:36:07,858
You're a genius.
You've got a gift of psychology.

1721
01:36:08,022 --> 01:36:11,219
-I don't know about that...
-I'm telling you...

1722
01:36:22,382 --> 01:36:24,259
-Sera...
-What is it?

1723
01:36:25,262 --> 01:36:27,059
I want to talk to you...

1724
01:36:29,462 --> 01:36:31,498
I've been thinking...

1725
01:36:32,542 --> 01:36:34,373
I have a personal project.

1726
01:36:34,542 --> 01:36:37,693
Have you realized
how people need therapy

1727
01:36:37,862 --> 01:36:39,898
but don't have the time?

1728
01:36:40,062 --> 01:36:41,211
I have a solution.

1729
01:36:41,382 --> 01:36:42,132
What?

1730
01:36:42,782 --> 01:36:43,817
Taxi-therapy.

1731
01:36:45,542 --> 01:36:46,895
Taxi-therapy?

1732
01:36:47,142 --> 01:36:50,293
You give them therapy...
on the road.

1733
01:36:50,542 --> 01:36:52,021
Taxi-therapy.

1734
01:36:53,942 --> 01:36:55,375
You are...

1735
01:36:56,302 --> 01:36:57,576
you are...

1736
01:36:59,742 --> 01:37:02,302
I can see it, I'm seeing it.

1737
01:37:02,622 --> 01:37:04,499
This could be global.

1738
01:37:07,502 --> 01:37:11,620
I want to do it right, Serafín.
I'll need a bit of money

1739
01:37:11,782 --> 01:37:15,331
to invest in some nice
leather seats

1740
01:37:15,622 --> 01:37:19,171
and a music system
with weird music...

1741
01:37:19,782 --> 01:37:21,181
You got it.

1742
01:37:21,622 --> 01:37:26,457
I'll give you 2,000 euros
to begin with.

1743
01:37:26,622 --> 01:37:27,975
Whatever you get is yours.

1744
01:37:29,222 --> 01:37:32,737
But please, try and sort out
a driving licence.

1745
01:37:33,102 --> 01:37:34,455
Yeah, sure.

1746
01:37:35,982 --> 01:37:38,542
-I'll pick you up at nine.
-At the door.

1747
01:37:38,942 --> 01:37:42,173
Fuck the job, fuck soccer.

1748
01:37:44,182 --> 01:37:45,774
Not here...

1749
01:37:46,782 --> 01:37:48,374
That belly of yours...

1750
01:37:51,222 --> 01:37:55,613
-What about your movie?
-How's the sexy groom?

1751
01:37:55,782 --> 01:37:57,215
Here you go, you deserve it.

1752
01:37:57,382 --> 01:38:00,135
The movie's going ahead,
but I'm not doing it.

1753
01:38:00,302 --> 01:38:03,214
Problems with the pig.
They cut my part out.

1754
01:38:03,382 --> 01:38:06,101
You know what I'm doing now?
"Off-stage."

1755
01:38:07,502 --> 01:38:11,017
You're one hell of an actor,
Carlos. A fucking star.

1756
01:38:11,182 --> 01:38:13,491
To hell with producers.

1757
01:38:13,662 --> 01:38:15,141
How was your exam?

1758
01:38:15,302 --> 01:38:18,214
It went very well.
But I think I'm giving it up.

1759
01:38:18,702 --> 01:38:21,819
Psychology's not so much about
studying, it's having a gift.

1760
01:38:21,982 --> 01:38:25,179
Otherwise you reach a point
where you don't see people,

1761
01:38:25,342 --> 01:38:27,537
you just see books.

1762
01:38:27,702 --> 01:38:30,091
No don't think so much, Antonio.

1763
01:38:31,182 --> 01:38:35,733
What a beautiful couple, magical,
so "genuwine," so sudden.

1764
01:38:35,902 --> 01:38:37,494
My hairs are on end.

1765
01:38:37,662 --> 01:38:41,211
-Thanks for the suit, cousin.
-No problem. You look great.

1766
01:38:41,382 --> 01:38:45,773
I've got a girl begging for it.
You know what weddings are like.

1767
01:38:45,942 --> 01:38:47,614
Where's Manolito?

1768
01:38:47,782 --> 01:38:50,580
-At home. He's looking great.
-What a funny guy.

1769
01:38:50,742 --> 01:38:51,936
Great party!

1770
01:38:52,102 --> 01:38:55,014
You've got some nerve.
I knew what you were up to.

1771
01:38:55,182 --> 01:38:57,742
You could see right through me!

1772
01:38:59,422 --> 01:39:00,571
-Serafín.
-Yeah?

1773
01:39:00,742 --> 01:39:02,698
-Does it hurt?
-Like hell, but who cares?

1774
01:39:02,862 --> 01:39:04,978
-Have you got a moment?
-Course, shoot.

1775
01:39:05,142 --> 01:39:06,621
No, but in private.

1776
01:39:06,782 --> 01:39:07,931
Sure.

1777
01:39:08,542 --> 01:39:13,821
Well, since I've graduated
I'm at a bit of a loose end.

1778
01:39:14,182 --> 01:39:19,131
I thought, seeing you've got
so many companies,

1779
01:39:19,302 --> 01:39:21,532
maybe I could work with you,
or for you.

1780
01:39:21,702 --> 01:39:24,421
Because I know a lot about law.

1781
01:39:24,582 --> 01:39:26,493
You can trust me, Serafín.

1782
01:39:26,662 --> 01:39:30,860
Well Gonzalo, that's something I've
been thinking about for a while.

1783
01:39:31,222 --> 01:39:34,817
You won't be my lawyer,
you'll be my right-hand man.

1784
01:39:34,982 --> 01:39:38,770
I used to push pills at weekends
in Valencia.

1785
01:39:39,142 --> 01:39:42,214
In Puzzle, Barbacoa, Baraca...

1786
01:39:42,382 --> 01:39:44,338
And now that...

1787
01:39:44,502 --> 01:39:47,858
I've given that up,
can I be your friend?

1788
01:39:48,302 --> 01:39:49,701
-What?
-OK.

1789
01:39:50,222 --> 01:39:54,181
Play soccer with you,
go for picnics,

1790
01:39:54,342 --> 01:39:58,381
to theme parks,
go to the beach,

1791
01:39:58,542 --> 01:40:01,579
maybe go mountain-climbing,
motorbike riding...

1792
01:40:02,702 --> 01:40:05,421
and... and...

1793
01:40:06,942 --> 01:40:08,853
and...

1794
01:40:11,382 --> 01:40:13,293
and...

1795
01:40:15,782 --> 01:40:18,535
and hang out...

1796
01:40:20,422 --> 01:40:22,333
and to discos with girls...

1797
01:40:23,302 --> 01:40:24,735
and...

1798
01:40:25,982 --> 01:40:27,574
Will you dance with me?

1799
01:40:28,582 --> 01:40:31,176
Not now, my knee's
swollen up like that.

1800
01:40:32,742 --> 01:40:34,972
You want a separation, don't you?

1801
01:40:36,022 --> 01:40:37,421
You don't love me

1802
01:40:37,942 --> 01:40:40,376
and you don't want
to have a child with me.

1803
01:40:41,622 --> 01:40:44,853
We could have been so happy,
like a normal family:

1804
01:40:45,062 --> 01:40:46,893
dad, mum...

1805
01:40:48,142 --> 01:40:51,452
But you don't love me,
you don't love us.

1806
01:40:54,102 --> 01:40:58,061
We haven't even decided if the
nursery should be public or private.

1807
01:40:59,382 --> 01:41:01,259
Answer me please:

1808
01:41:02,182 --> 01:41:04,457
do you want a separation?

1809
01:41:10,662 --> 01:41:11,856
Private.

1810
01:41:12,902 --> 01:41:14,779
The private nursery.

1811
01:41:19,142 --> 01:41:21,133
Miguel, I'm going to see a lawyer.

1812
01:41:21,342 --> 01:41:22,536
A lawyer?

1813
01:41:23,262 --> 01:41:26,777
But you can come and see the kids
whenever you like.

1814
01:41:27,142 --> 01:41:28,211
Okay?

1815
01:41:28,742 --> 01:41:29,697
Right.

1816
01:41:30,342 --> 01:41:31,297
Well...

1817
01:41:32,822 --> 01:41:37,213
I'm going to sing a song
I composed. I've composed it.

1818
01:41:37,542 --> 01:41:39,533
No, Miguel, don't sing.

1819
01:41:39,702 --> 01:41:42,216
Don't make a fool of yourself
and of me...

1820
01:41:42,382 --> 01:41:46,534
That's enough. I'm going to sing.
I'm going to sing. That's enough!

1821
01:41:46,702 --> 01:41:49,136
Let me do something
for once in my life.

1822
01:41:51,902 --> 01:41:54,780
I love you a lot,
but you wear me out.

1823
01:42:01,902 --> 01:42:03,381
-Hi.
-Hi.

1824
01:42:05,222 --> 01:42:07,178
Aren't you going
to ask me to dance?

1825
01:42:07,342 --> 01:42:10,300
-I'm clumsy, but if you want...
-...to marry you.

1826
01:42:10,942 --> 01:42:11,818
What?

1827
01:42:11,982 --> 01:42:15,531
I want to marry you.
Have babies with you, buy a house...

1828
01:42:17,542 --> 01:42:19,260
Well, maybe a dance.

1829
01:42:34,462 --> 01:42:36,054
We were too late.

1830
01:42:36,222 --> 01:42:39,180
Hello, I'm Miguel Pichoto

1831
01:42:39,422 --> 01:42:43,415
and I'd like to sing a song
I composed especially for my friends

1832
01:42:44,302 --> 01:42:46,293
and for the newlyweds.

1833
01:42:46,942 --> 01:42:48,694
It goes something like this:

1834
01:42:50,022 --> 01:42:51,978
One, two, three.

1835
01:42:59,662 --> 01:43:03,018
<i>What is the question,</i>
<i>I know the answer...</i>

1836
01:43:03,182 --> 01:43:04,331
<i>Tell me</i>

1837
01:43:04,502 --> 01:43:06,652
<i>if I've found the doorway...</i>

1838
01:43:07,182 --> 01:43:09,457
I want to marry you, Jorge.

1839
01:43:09,622 --> 01:43:13,820
The Daniel thing was a mistake.
I was scared of marriage.

1840
01:43:14,262 --> 01:43:17,140
But I'm not any more.

1841
01:43:20,022 --> 01:43:22,092
You mind if we sit down a minute?

1842
01:43:24,702 --> 01:43:28,138
<i>And now what?</i>
<i>And now what?</i>

1843
01:43:28,862 --> 01:43:31,899
<i>And now what?</i>
<i>And now what?</i>

1844
01:43:33,462 --> 01:43:35,339
It's the right thing to do.

1845
01:43:40,782 --> 01:43:41,976
I don't know.

1846
01:43:42,782 --> 01:43:44,374
I should be going.

1847
01:43:45,342 --> 01:43:49,620
My uncle said housing prices
are low. With my wage and yours...

1848
01:43:49,782 --> 01:43:51,773
Our families would help us.

1849
01:43:53,582 --> 01:43:55,174
I've got to go.

1850
01:43:55,862 --> 01:43:56,977
I've got to go.

1851
01:44:01,382 --> 01:44:02,371
I'm sorry.

1852
01:44:16,982 --> 01:44:20,179
This is the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

1853
01:44:20,342 --> 01:44:22,298
That guy's got talent.

1854
01:44:22,462 --> 01:44:24,373
He's really something.

1855
01:44:26,462 --> 01:44:30,137
<i>And now what?</i>
<i>And now what?</i>

1856
01:44:30,302 --> 01:44:33,499
<i>And now what?</i>
<i>And now what?</i>

1857
01:44:44,902 --> 01:44:45,698
Jorge.

1858
01:44:50,862 --> 01:44:53,171
You left your stomach medicine.

1859
01:44:53,782 --> 01:44:54,737
Thanks.

1860
01:44:57,862 --> 01:44:59,295
Well, I'm going in.

1861
01:45:02,822 --> 01:45:03,811
Goodbye.

1862
01:45:04,662 --> 01:45:05,617
Goodbye.

1863
01:45:13,662 --> 01:45:15,141
Are you OK?

1864
01:45:21,582 --> 01:45:23,937
You're a great singer, Miguel.

1865
01:45:24,102 --> 01:45:25,421
Thank you.

1866
01:45:26,102 --> 01:45:28,980
Look, Violeta,
my platonic girlfriend.

1867
01:45:29,262 --> 01:45:33,050
-You have more songs, don't you?
-One more, but...

1868
01:45:33,222 --> 01:45:34,621
Great.

1869
01:45:34,782 --> 01:45:36,818
Well, you give me 2,000 euros now

1870
01:45:36,982 --> 01:45:40,691
and I'll make you a star
in no time. I've even got a lawyer.

1871
01:45:41,022 --> 01:45:43,297
2,000 euros? I don't know...

1872
01:45:43,462 --> 01:45:46,693
I'll probably have to pay out
three times as much.

1873
01:45:47,302 --> 01:45:51,614
But don't thank me.
We'll both make a killing.

1874
01:45:51,782 --> 01:45:56,094
When I get a hunch, the bell rings.
And this'll be one hell of a bell.

1875
01:46:04,342 --> 01:46:05,457
Violeta.

1876
01:46:05,942 --> 01:46:07,216
What's wrong?

1877
01:46:25,262 --> 01:46:26,695
Aren't you going?

1878
01:46:30,142 --> 01:46:34,579
Maybe I rushed into things saying

1879
01:46:34,742 --> 01:46:36,972
we should get married, but...

1880
01:46:37,222 --> 01:46:41,215
since my uncle said
it was a good time to buy...

1881
01:46:42,262 --> 01:46:44,617
and if we ask for a loan
we could

1882
01:46:44,782 --> 01:46:46,613
buy ourselves a car...

1883
01:46:47,422 --> 01:46:50,573
We could look in Valdebernardo.
I heard it's cheap.

1884
01:46:50,862 --> 01:46:52,773
-And not too far away.
-No.

1885
01:46:52,942 --> 01:46:54,091
Up Elipa!

1886
01:46:54,262 --> 01:46:57,698
Come on, Jorge, we've fucking won.
Next year we're signing up again.

1887
01:46:57,862 --> 01:47:00,137
Come on,
let's see everyone dancing.

1888
01:47:00,302 --> 01:47:02,133
Change partners!

1889
01:47:14,302 --> 01:47:15,894
I can see the light...
