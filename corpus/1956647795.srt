924
00:56:30,925 --> 00:56:34,678
Don't you understand that my
parents are going to kill me?

925
00:56:34,783 --> 00:56:37,216
Your parents aren't
going to find out.

926
00:56:41,664 --> 00:56:43,854
What's that supposed to mean?

927
00:56:43,958 --> 00:56:48,859
Look, to put it bluntly,
Heather, your parents are dead.

928
00:57:04,292 --> 00:57:05,439
Charity, that's not funny.

HEATHER (VOICEOVER):
I don't know where

931
00:57:25,702 --> 00:57:29,733
we are when I woke up the
next day, but something in Rod

932
00:57:29,837 --> 00:57:30,984
had changed.

933
00:57:31,089 --> 00:57:35,329
It was like I didn't even
know who he was anymore.

934
00:57:48,988 --> 00:57:51,562
Aww, fuck.

935
00:57:51,665 --> 00:57:52,742
Fuck.

936
00:57:52,847 --> 00:57:54,342
What the fuck!

937
00:57:54,446 --> 00:57:55,801
What's up?

938
00:57:55,905 --> 00:57:57,574
Something's wrong with
this fucking Explorer.

939
00:57:57,678 --> 00:57:59,207
That's what's up.

940
00:57:59,312 --> 00:58:00,146
What do you mean?

941
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:01,258
I don't know.

942
00:58:01,363 --> 00:58:02,787
It's driving fine,
then it's slowing down,

943
00:58:02,891 --> 00:58:06,124
and driving fine,
slowing down, sputtering.

944
00:58:06,228 --> 00:58:08,140
ROD: It's because it's
out of gas, moron!

945
00:58:08,245 --> 00:58:09,114
God.

946
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:17,872
That was so fucking stupid.

947
00:58:17,976 --> 00:58:18,880
Don't start with me.

948
00:58:18,984 --> 00:58:20,201
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey.

949
00:58:20,305 --> 00:58:21,764
Hey, shut the fuck up.
- Idiot.

Hey.

951
00:58:22,703 --> 00:58:24,372
Shut the fuck up, all right?

952
00:58:24,476 --> 00:58:25,345
I'm so sorry, man.

953
00:58:25,449 --> 00:58:27,431
I wasn't paying attention.

954
00:58:27,535 --> 00:58:29,724
Hey.

955
00:58:29,828 --> 00:58:31,670
Momentary lapse of senses.

956
00:58:31,775 --> 00:58:35,077
Don't let it happen
again, all right?

957
00:58:35,181 --> 00:58:37,475
Don't fucking let
it happen again.

958
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:38,900
Jeez.

959
00:58:39,004 --> 00:58:41,124
What are we going to do?

What?

What are we going to do?

962
00:58:45,365 --> 00:58:46,547
We're going to go get gas now.

963
00:58:49,223 --> 00:58:50,717
It's going to be
a hell of a walk.

964
00:58:55,861 --> 00:58:57,461
Hey.

965
00:58:57,565 --> 00:58:58,607
Where are you going?

966
00:58:58,711 --> 00:59:01,596
I'm going to get gas.

to go get the gas.

Don't let anything
fucking happen to them.

976

- I got you.
- Huh?

Let's go.

00:59:54,358 --> 00:59:56,859
That's Rod's seat.

984
00:59:56,963 --> 00:59:59,084
I don't see him
sitting in it, do you?

985
00:59:59,189 --> 01:00:03,568
Just don't be sitting in it
when he gets back, that's all.

986
01:00:03,672 --> 01:00:06,210
You really are scared
of him, aren't you?

987
01:00:06,314 --> 01:00:07,426
I'm not scared of him.

988
01:00:07,531 --> 01:00:08,885
You're scared to death of him.

of everything.

I've got powers.

Rod's given me powers
as a vampire and stuff.

And-- and I am not
scared of anything.

powers weakening.

you're talking about.

the fuck are you doing!

be strong when you

go through all this effort

of wearing their uniforms
and carrying their weapons,

It is so clear to me now that
our family cannot be stopped.

When we go to New
Orleans, our coven--

we form and we mutate.

1072
01:04:22,994 --> 01:04:26,296
And perhaps, we might
even be able to forge

are you doing with those?

get away or not?
