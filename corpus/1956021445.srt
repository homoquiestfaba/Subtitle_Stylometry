182
00:19:59,553 --> 00:20:02,088
I have a lot of resistance
to things like this,

183
00:20:02,206 --> 00:20:05,244
but I came to these
a couple years ago.

184
00:20:05,285 --> 00:20:08,392
Well, I was forced to come
and I guess it, um...

185
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:11,778
I guess it helped. So, um...

186
00:20:14,766 --> 00:20:18,357
My mom was old and she wasn't
all together there at the end.

187
00:20:18,439 --> 00:20:20,783
And we were pretty much
estranged before that,

188
00:20:20,785 --> 00:20:23,706
so it really wasn't
a huge blow.

189
00:20:23,999 --> 00:20:29,239
But I did love her.

190
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:32,120
And she didn't have
an easy life.

191
00:20:32,171 --> 00:20:35,306
She had DID, which became
extreme at the end.

192
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:36,991
And dementia.

193
00:20:37,093 --> 00:20:41,127
And my father died when I was
a baby from starvation,

194
00:20:41,209 --> 00:20:44,026
um, because he had
psychotic depression

195
00:20:44,096 --> 00:20:44,823
and he starved himself,

196
00:20:44,825 --> 00:20:47,091
which I'm sure was just
as pleasant as it sounds.

197
00:20:47,148 --> 00:20:48,680
And then there's my brother.

198
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,730
My older brother
had schizophrenia

199
00:20:50,794 --> 00:20:52,060
and when he was 16

200
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,835
he hanged himself
in my mother's bedroom

201
00:20:53,897 --> 00:20:55,545
and of course
the suicide note blamed her

202
00:20:55,581 --> 00:20:58,982
accusing her of putting people
inside him. So.

That was my mom's life.

205
00:21:17,116 --> 00:21:18,346
And then she lived
in our house

206
00:21:18,348 --> 00:21:20,062
at the end before hospice.

207
00:21:20,098 --> 00:21:21,616

before that.

208
00:21:21,684 --> 00:21:23,679

and then we weren't.

209

And then we were.

210
00:21:28,479 --> 00:21:30,035
She's completely manipulative.

211
00:21:30,071 --> 00:21:33,456
Until my husband finally
enforced a no-contact rule,

212
00:21:33,514 --> 00:21:35,777
which lasted until I got
pregnant with my daughter.

213
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:36,943
I didn't let her
anywhere near me

214
00:21:36,945 --> 00:21:38,597
when I had my first, my son,

215
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:40,464
which is why I gave her
my daughter,

216
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,928
who she immediately
stabbed her hooks into.

217

When she got sick,

220
00:21:48,802 --> 00:21:51,041
not that she was really even
my mom at the end,

221
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:55,677
and not that she would ever
feel guilty about anything.

222

632
01:02:32,729 --> 01:02:38,691

I didn't even want to, but she
brought her grandson back

knowing my mom

but she approached me.

and she showed me how.

On the necklace
my mom gave me.

1112

It's her necklace, right?
They're both wearing it,

1113

and they're wearing it
in every photo.

Did you see up there?

1115
01:42:37,774 --> 01:42:40,331

the cemetery called, I said,

1123
01:42:52,609 --> 01:42:54,817
"Oh, I won't tell her
because she'd be worried."
