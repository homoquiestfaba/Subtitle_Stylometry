1
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,119
We will never understand
his earthly struggles,

2
00:01:56,151 --> 00:01:58,855
but have faith his soul
is in good hands.

3
00:01:58,888 --> 00:02:00,857
So we remember
a business partner,

4
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:02,692
a brother, and a husband.

5
00:02:02,725 --> 00:02:06,029
We say goodbye
to Jeffrey Scott Fredericks

6
00:02:06,062 --> 00:02:09,065
and ask that he finds mercy
in the heavens.

7
00:02:09,098 --> 00:02:11,134
Amen.

8
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:13,636
Thank you so much for coming.

9
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:17,305
Nobody wants to be around him,
even in death.

10
00:02:17,339 --> 00:02:19,207
We want to support you, Claire.

11
00:02:19,241 --> 00:02:21,510
Well, he's not suffering now.

12
00:02:21,544 --> 00:02:23,880
He's watching over me.

13
00:02:25,014 --> 00:02:27,583
No, he's not.

14
00:02:27,617 --> 00:02:31,219
At this very second,
I can see him burning

15
00:02:31,253 --> 00:02:33,690
in the pits of Hell
for all eternity.

16
00:02:33,723 --> 00:02:35,323
Rosalie.

17
00:02:38,961 --> 00:02:41,664
Thank you both for coming in.

18
00:02:41,698 --> 00:02:45,101
I'm sure you have
some questions for me.

19
00:02:45,134 --> 00:02:47,103
How bad is it, Dr. Warren?

20
00:02:47,136 --> 00:02:49,839
Well, is this
a normal occurrence

21
00:02:49,872 --> 00:02:51,741
that you get called
to Rosalie's schools

22
00:02:51,774 --> 00:02:53,543
to discuss her behavior?

23
00:02:53,576 --> 00:02:57,680
She's had such a tough time
adjusting to the new school.

24
00:02:58,948 --> 00:03:00,750
I tried to pull her record...

25
00:03:12,829 --> 00:03:15,631
Ugh! Ugh.

26
00:03:17,133 --> 00:03:18,568
Ugh!

27
00:03:18,601 --> 00:03:21,236
Ahhhh!

28
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:23,206
Wahhhh!

29
00:03:23,238 --> 00:03:25,875
There it is, there it is,
there it is.

30
00:03:28,111 --> 00:03:30,445
I said I tried to pull her
records from Shanesville.

31
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:33,783
Problem is, I couldn't even find
a city with that name.

32
00:03:33,816 --> 00:03:37,153
Oh, uh, it's, um,
outside of Des Moines.

33
00:03:37,186 --> 00:03:40,388
Uh, unincorporated, though,
so it... it never shows up.

34
00:03:40,422 --> 00:03:43,626
She was home-schooled
while we were there, so...

35
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:46,095
Rosalie exhibits characteristics

36
00:03:46,129 --> 00:03:49,331
of some in my field could call
an emotional disorder.

37
00:03:49,364 --> 00:03:52,300
There are signs of psychopathy,
as well as evidence

38
00:03:52,334 --> 00:03:56,572
of interacting with identities
that are not present.

39
00:03:56,606 --> 00:04:00,243
Are you saying she's like
Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde?

40
00:04:00,275 --> 00:04:03,512
It's a misconception that
multiple personality disorder

41
00:04:03,546 --> 00:04:05,181
is the same as schizophrenia.

42
00:04:05,214 --> 00:04:08,584
Schizophrenia is when
the patient sees and hears

43
00:04:08,618 --> 00:04:10,253
things that are not there.

44
00:04:10,285 --> 00:04:12,121
And I'm sorry to say,
but I do believe

45
00:04:12,155 --> 00:04:13,790
that this characterizes Rosalie.

46
00:04:13,823 --> 00:04:15,992
Well, uh, thank you
for your time, Doctor.

47
00:04:16,025 --> 00:04:18,460
I-I-It can't be easy
to do your job.

48
00:04:18,493 --> 00:04:20,263
But I haven't even begun.

49
00:04:20,295 --> 00:04:23,199
There are treatments
for this disorder

50
00:04:23,232 --> 00:04:25,802
that I feel would best benefit
Rosalie's...

51
00:04:25,835 --> 00:04:28,171
We're... We're moving again.

52
00:04:28,204 --> 00:04:31,607
- What? So soon?
- With my job, I-I don't choose.

53
00:04:31,641 --> 00:04:34,043
I get sent.
- We are going to get help

54
00:04:34,076 --> 00:04:36,646
for her as soon
as we get settled.

55
00:04:36,679 --> 00:04:39,715
Thank you, Doctor.

56
00:04:48,758 --> 00:04:51,359
Rosalie? How ya doin', honey?

57
00:04:51,393 --> 00:04:53,361
You excited to move
to a new town?

58
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:26,528
No, silly. I'm Rosalie.

59
00:05:26,562 --> 00:05:28,831
- Oh!
- Oops!

60
00:06:18,281 --> 00:06:20,983
You don't want that.

61
00:06:21,017 --> 00:06:22,652
Trust me.

62
00:06:24,954 --> 00:06:27,957
Hey, I'm doing you a favor.

63
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:31,127
Trust me,
I'm the one doing you the favor.

64
00:06:39,434 --> 00:06:41,436
It's lovely.

65
00:06:41,469 --> 00:06:42,972
It is nice.

66
00:06:45,308 --> 00:06:48,010
Won't be long now, Rosalie.

67
00:06:59,355 --> 00:07:00,522
Isn't it cute?

68
00:07:00,556 --> 00:07:03,192
It <i>is</i> cute.

69
00:07:15,638 --> 00:07:17,472
Hey, hey!

70
00:07:17,505 --> 00:07:19,008
Betty Goss.

71
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:20,443
Brand-new, right?

72
00:07:20,475 --> 00:07:23,546
Welcome!
Welcome!

73
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:26,949
- Thank you.
- And who might you be? Hmm?

74
00:07:26,983 --> 00:07:29,852
Oh, this is our daughter,
Rosalie.

75
00:07:29,885 --> 00:07:31,654
Oh!

76
00:07:31,687 --> 00:07:34,023
- The move and all...
- Oh, of course.

77
00:07:34,056 --> 00:07:37,326
Hey, heads up... we take care
of our own around here.

78
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,494
You know that saying,
"It takes a village"?

79
00:07:39,527 --> 00:07:42,298
Well, we put other
neighborhood watches to shame.

80
00:07:42,331 --> 00:07:46,534
If it happens around here,
it's in "The Mirror."

81
00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:48,004
Wh... That's our newspaper.

82
00:07:51,374 --> 00:07:53,009
I didn't catch your names.

83
00:07:53,042 --> 00:07:55,911
I'm Theresa Snyder.
This is my husband, Daniel.

84
00:07:55,945 --> 00:07:59,148
Hi. Oh, Catholic, huh?

85
00:07:59,181 --> 00:08:01,484
Now, St. Peters is the only
Catholic Church in town,

86
00:08:01,516 --> 00:08:04,487
but Father Paul is the <i>best.</i>
- Oh.

87
00:08:04,553 --> 00:08:08,157
Why are you...
wearing your rosary?

88
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:10,159
It makes me feel closer to Him.

89
00:08:10,192 --> 00:08:13,763
Oh!
Well, I'm not one to judge,

90
00:08:13,796 --> 00:08:17,733
but there are those who say
that is just not done.

91
00:08:17,767 --> 00:08:21,037
Yeah, uh, we better get
all our stuff in the house.

92
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:24,540
Well, I'm just down the street
if you ever need anything.

93
00:08:24,573 --> 00:08:27,777
We're <i>very</i> tight-knit
around here.

94
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:31,080
We keep watch after our own.

95
00:08:31,113 --> 00:08:33,582
Buh-bye!

96
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,689
Spiritual healing.

97
00:08:40,723 --> 00:08:43,559
Maybe they got something
that could actually help her.

98
00:08:43,592 --> 00:08:47,129
Maybe.

99
00:08:47,163 --> 00:08:50,399
This is the kind of town
I could really settle down in.

100
00:08:51,767 --> 00:08:55,071
Don't get attached.
I'm here for work.

101
00:09:02,812 --> 00:09:05,948
Soon, I promise.

102
00:09:07,917 --> 00:09:10,486
We'll be on
the other side of this.

103
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:15,257
Guys, look at the frog!

104
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:16,826
- Gross! Get it!
- Let's go!

105
00:09:16,859 --> 00:09:18,594
- Get it. Get it.
- Come on! Get him!

106
00:09:18,627 --> 00:09:20,763
It's so cute.

107
00:09:30,306 --> 00:09:31,607
Ew, gross!

108
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,142
Ugh!

109
00:09:33,175 --> 00:09:36,444
- Ew, gross!
- Disgusting!

110
00:09:55,997 --> 00:09:59,000
Honey, go inside.
Mommy's gonna dry you off.

111
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:08,143
Did you make some new friends?

112
00:10:14,682 --> 00:10:16,651
Go on.

113
00:10:33,434 --> 00:10:36,639
Hey! Just wanted to welcome
you guys to town.

114
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,705
John Driscoll.

115
00:10:37,739 --> 00:10:40,175
- Oh, come on in.
- Thank you.

116
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:43,878
Daniel Snyder.
This is my wife, Theresa.

117
00:10:43,912 --> 00:10:45,680
Nice to meet you, John.

118
00:10:45,713 --> 00:10:48,716
Ah. What brings you folks here
from Des Moines?

119
00:10:49,951 --> 00:10:53,221
How'd you know we came
from Des Moines?

120
00:10:53,254 --> 00:10:54,522
- License plate.
- Ah.

121
00:10:54,557 --> 00:10:56,824
I used to live in Iowa.

122
00:10:56,858 --> 00:10:58,561
Uh, job.

123
00:10:58,594 --> 00:11:01,496
I'm gonna be working at
Dynata Tech, insurance division.

124
00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:04,532
Oh, nice.
Not too far from the plant.

125
00:11:04,567 --> 00:11:06,602
I'm foreman there.

126
00:11:06,635 --> 00:11:08,269
Well, listen, I didn't come here

127
00:11:08,303 --> 00:11:10,205
to take over the world
or anything.

128
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:15,210
Just came to introduce myself
and welcome you to the 'hood.

129
00:11:15,243 --> 00:11:18,179
Hey, join me for a beer anytime.

130
00:11:18,213 --> 00:11:19,781
Will do.

131
00:12:03,858 --> 00:12:06,070
You're the one
saying "Don't become attached

132
00:12:06,094 --> 00:12:07,630
because there's a job to do."

133
00:12:07,663 --> 00:12:08,930
The faster you work,

134
00:12:08,963 --> 00:12:10,765
the sooner we'll be able
to help her.

135
00:12:10,798 --> 00:12:13,067
This is a process.

136
00:12:13,101 --> 00:12:15,136
We have to make sure
the job is done <i>right.</i>

137
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:16,938
You know how to do the job!

138
00:12:16,971 --> 00:12:19,140
There has to be another way!

139
00:12:26,481 --> 00:12:29,017
I'll start tomorrow.
I promise.

140
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:31,019
Come on. Come on, baby.

141
00:12:35,456 --> 00:12:38,293
Oh, hey, hi.

142
00:12:38,326 --> 00:12:40,428
Harlan Lester.

143
00:12:40,461 --> 00:12:42,463
- Daniel Snyder.
- Yeah, yeah.

144
00:12:42,497 --> 00:12:44,365
Hey, listen, uh, my mother...

145
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,802
She's making her famous, uh,
chicken and trifle tonight.

146
00:12:47,835 --> 00:12:50,004
She insists that you
and your family

147
00:12:50,038 --> 00:12:53,274
just come on over,
and John will be there, too.

148
00:12:53,308 --> 00:12:55,577
- Uh...
- Mother insists.

149
00:12:57,412 --> 00:12:59,615
Sounds good.

150
00:12:59,648 --> 00:13:01,316
Very good.

151
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:37,653
Speak of the devil. Okay.

152
00:13:37,686 --> 00:13:39,020
Betty, what happened?

153
00:13:39,053 --> 00:13:40,823
Mrs. Henderson
had a heart attack.

154
00:13:40,855 --> 00:13:42,558
I mean, who didn't see that
coming, huh?

155
00:13:42,591 --> 00:13:44,492
Oh, that's terrible.

156
00:13:44,525 --> 00:13:46,595
Yeah, pretty bad.

157
00:13:46,628 --> 00:13:48,697
Thank you.

158
00:13:48,731 --> 00:13:50,231
Wait right there.

159
00:13:50,264 --> 00:13:51,842
Break room's straight ahead,
and, of course,

160
00:13:51,866 --> 00:13:55,203
don't hesitate to reach out
if you need any support.

161
00:13:55,236 --> 00:13:57,205
Thank you, Mr. Woronicz.
I appreciate that.

162
00:13:57,238 --> 00:13:58,940
Please. Gary.

163
00:14:00,241 --> 00:14:03,177
Love your briefcase. Classy.

164
00:14:03,211 --> 00:14:06,682
It'll make a great impression on
clients when you do house calls.

165
00:14:06,715 --> 00:14:09,050
People tend to get, uh, weary

166
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,252
of the dreaded
insurance salesman.

167
00:14:15,824 --> 00:14:17,458
Are you okay?

168
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,630
Uh, yeah. Sorry.

169
00:14:21,663 --> 00:14:24,031
Sales is not for everyone,

170
00:14:24,065 --> 00:14:26,401
especially door-to-door.
- I-It's good.

171
00:14:26,434 --> 00:14:28,871
I've been doing it a long time.
I-I know how to close.

172
00:14:28,903 --> 00:14:31,272
Well, then,
I'll leave you to it.

173
00:14:31,305 --> 00:14:33,542
Welcome to the playground.

174
00:14:45,253 --> 00:14:48,456
Well, aren't you three
a lovely family?

175
00:14:48,489 --> 00:14:50,057
Adorable.

176
00:14:50,091 --> 00:14:52,728
- They're joining the parish!
- Oh, wonderful!

177
00:14:52,761 --> 00:14:53,829
Ooh, Catholic!

178
00:14:53,862 --> 00:14:56,130
Oh, speaking of adorable,

179
00:14:56,164 --> 00:14:58,801
Tammy Reid called
Kathy We is man...

180
00:14:58,834 --> 00:15:01,135
she's Jewish...

181
00:15:01,169 --> 00:15:03,180
started calling
her daughter adorable,

182
00:15:03,204 --> 00:15:05,339
and Kathy just went all...
- I understand you do

183
00:15:05,373 --> 00:15:07,609
life insurance
for people my age?

184
00:15:07,643 --> 00:15:09,912
Oh, her premium is
ri-donk-ulous,

185
00:15:09,944 --> 00:15:13,114
as they say on the streets.

186
00:15:13,147 --> 00:15:14,949
He would love to.

187
00:15:14,982 --> 00:15:17,185
If you have 15 minutes
of free time,

188
00:15:17,218 --> 00:15:19,253
he could do a profile on you.

189
00:15:19,287 --> 00:15:20,823
Right, honey?

190
00:15:23,124 --> 00:15:24,660
Uh, sure.

191
00:15:24,693 --> 00:15:27,028
Since my son will be
abandoning me

192
00:15:27,061 --> 00:15:29,430
for his sacred bowling
tomorrow night,

193
00:15:29,464 --> 00:15:31,800
I get home from bingo at 7:00.

194
00:15:31,834 --> 00:15:33,968
Oh, but then I have to
feed Zeus.

195
00:15:34,001 --> 00:15:38,105
- That's my kitty.
- I'd like 7:30, to be safe.

196
00:15:38,139 --> 00:15:40,809
No problem. 7:30 it is.

197
00:15:40,843 --> 00:15:43,511
Cats make the best pets.

198
00:15:43,545 --> 00:15:45,948
Yes, they do, sweetie.

199
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,783
They serve Him well.

200
00:15:47,816 --> 00:15:49,785
Serve who, sweetie?

201
00:15:49,818 --> 00:15:52,386
The Dark Lord.

202
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,856
Rosalie.

203
00:15:53,889 --> 00:15:56,224
You are excused.

204
00:15:56,257 --> 00:15:57,793
Now.

205
00:15:59,527 --> 00:16:03,164
What in the Jiminy Crickets
was that?

206
00:16:03,197 --> 00:16:06,167
Your, uh, daughter <i>always</i>
talk like that,

207
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,502
Mr. and Mrs. Snyder?

208
00:16:07,536 --> 00:16:09,538
She's having such a rough time

209
00:16:09,571 --> 00:16:11,172
adjusting
to the new environment.

210
00:16:11,205 --> 00:16:13,976
I'm, uh, thinking about
taking her to the reservation.

211
00:16:14,008 --> 00:16:15,744
- No!
- No!

212
00:16:15,777 --> 00:16:17,512
Not the best idea.

213
00:16:17,546 --> 00:16:20,181
Oh, don't be so dramatic.
It's just legend.

214
00:16:20,214 --> 00:16:23,986
The reservation
does not respect this town.

215
00:16:24,018 --> 00:16:25,554
You know, some people say
they're evil,

216
00:16:25,587 --> 00:16:27,689
but I don't get involved
with the gossip.

217
00:16:27,723 --> 00:16:29,423
They're just not good people.

218
00:16:29,457 --> 00:16:32,493
Bad things happen to anyone
who associates.

219
00:16:32,527 --> 00:16:35,329
Uh, look at Roger Stenson

220
00:16:35,363 --> 00:16:37,198
and Charlie Furber.

221
00:16:37,231 --> 00:16:39,835
The Leavenger family.

222
00:16:39,868 --> 00:16:42,804
What... What happened to them?

223
00:16:43,939 --> 00:16:48,409
Each visited the reservation
at some point in time.

224
00:16:48,442 --> 00:16:51,379
Every time after each visited,

225
00:16:51,412 --> 00:16:54,550
one bad thing after another.

226
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:56,852
Now, I don't want to use
the word "curse."

227
00:16:56,885 --> 00:16:58,887
It's a strong word, but, well...

228
00:16:58,921 --> 00:17:01,757
Young lady, you and your husband

229
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:04,626
best stay <i>away</i> from that place.

230
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:07,295
It's cursed.

231
00:17:07,328 --> 00:17:09,731
That is a strong word, Mother.

232
00:17:09,765 --> 00:17:11,833
It's cursed!

233
00:17:23,812 --> 00:17:26,715
I suppose the kid jumped!

234
00:17:31,085 --> 00:17:33,722
You can't just throw someone
out of a tree house

235
00:17:33,755 --> 00:17:35,456
because you don't like them.

236
00:17:35,489 --> 00:17:37,458
He could have been killed,
honey.

237
00:17:37,491 --> 00:17:39,226
He wasn't.

238
00:17:49,337 --> 00:17:51,773
Thank you so much
for inviting us.

239
00:17:51,807 --> 00:17:53,341
Oh, no problem.

240
00:17:53,374 --> 00:17:55,944
I'm so glad you finally accepted
my play-date invite.

241
00:17:55,978 --> 00:17:57,980
Sorry it took so long.

242
00:17:58,013 --> 00:18:02,651
We haven't had a lot of time
for play dates lately.

243
00:18:02,684 --> 00:18:05,754
Must be so hard
being the new kid in town.

244
00:18:05,787 --> 00:18:09,156
It's fine. An adjustment.

245
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,959
It's a process.

246
00:18:12,293 --> 00:18:14,630
Can I ask you
a personal question?

247
00:18:14,663 --> 00:18:16,965
I... suppose.

248
00:18:17,633 --> 00:18:20,501
Do you ever feel like
the walking dead?

249
00:18:21,036 --> 00:18:25,774
I mean, since I had Anna,
I just...

250
00:18:25,807 --> 00:18:28,610
zone out, you know? Like I...

251
00:18:28,644 --> 00:18:31,013
feel like I'm just
going through the motions

252
00:18:31,046 --> 00:18:34,248
and waiting for my life
to finish its course.

253
00:18:36,317 --> 00:18:43,257
Well, I-I think that feeling
wears off after time, Alice.

254
00:18:47,428 --> 00:18:49,430
We have to do more of these.

255
00:18:50,899 --> 00:18:53,035
Yeah.

256
00:19:37,045 --> 00:19:40,015
She's getting worse.
Did you see her face?

257
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:46,021
What if she's doing
these things?

258
00:19:46,054 --> 00:19:47,388
What if she did it?

259
00:19:47,421 --> 00:19:49,558
It's not <i>her.</i>

260
00:19:49,591 --> 00:19:51,593
She's my baby, too.

261
00:19:51,626 --> 00:19:55,630
If you don't do your job,
we're going to lose her forever.

262
00:20:01,402 --> 00:20:03,270
Rosalie, are you excited
to learn about

263
00:20:03,304 --> 00:20:05,974
the first people
to ever live on this land?

264
00:20:06,007 --> 00:20:07,642
No.

265
00:20:13,682 --> 00:20:16,317
- Rosalie!
- No! No! No! No!

266
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,652
No! No!
- Rosalie! Stop it!

267
00:20:17,686 --> 00:20:19,286
Stop it now!

268
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:53,021
There is no hope for her here.

269
00:20:53,054 --> 00:20:54,689
She must leave.

270
00:20:57,324 --> 00:20:59,293
Please.

271
00:20:59,326 --> 00:21:03,031
I will speak with <i>you,</i>
and you only.

272
00:21:03,064 --> 00:21:05,133
But she has to go.

273
00:21:12,641 --> 00:21:16,310
It's okay.
Um, we'll wait at the car.

274
00:21:16,343 --> 00:21:18,113
No.

275
00:21:18,146 --> 00:21:21,016
She cannot be on these grounds.

276
00:21:39,067 --> 00:21:40,735
Come.

277
00:21:52,379 --> 00:21:53,782
Sit.

278
00:21:57,351 --> 00:21:59,654
How did you know
who my daughter was?

279
00:21:59,688 --> 00:22:01,223
Oh, I didn't.

280
00:22:01,256 --> 00:22:03,925
I felt her... her evil...

281
00:22:03,959 --> 00:22:06,493
The second
she got out of that car.

282
00:22:06,527 --> 00:22:09,164
And she can never step foot
on these grounds again.

283
00:22:09,197 --> 00:22:10,899
That's not her.

284
00:22:10,932 --> 00:22:15,436
You... are not evil.

285
00:22:15,469 --> 00:22:17,906
I see you suffer.

286
00:22:17,939 --> 00:22:21,610
But I can't see all of you.

287
00:22:21,643 --> 00:22:24,913
Why did you invite me in here
if she can't be saved?

288
00:22:24,946 --> 00:22:28,183
Ah. I didn't say that
she can't be saved.

289
00:22:28,216 --> 00:22:31,786
And I-I don't know
that she <i>can</i> be saved.

290
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:36,390
I said she cannot
step foot on these grounds.

291
00:22:36,423 --> 00:22:40,461
Your daughter is going to
destroy you and her mother.

292
00:22:40,494 --> 00:22:44,366
If she can be saved... how?

293
00:22:44,398 --> 00:22:47,602
- You must reclaim her.
- Reclaim?

294
00:22:47,636 --> 00:22:49,237
I don't know what that means.

295
00:22:49,271 --> 00:22:53,808
Are you a-a-a witch
or something?

296
00:22:56,144 --> 00:22:57,913
I guess some would say so.

297
00:22:57,946 --> 00:23:01,316
I'm a seer. I practice the arts.

298
00:23:01,349 --> 00:23:03,318
Mm. The dark arts?

299
00:23:03,351 --> 00:23:06,588
There is no dark
without the light.

300
00:23:06,621 --> 00:23:09,024
It's all a part
of the same circle.

301
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:12,060
If you are in a dark room,

302
00:23:12,093 --> 00:23:15,330
the darkest of dark rooms,

303
00:23:15,363 --> 00:23:17,966
as dark as a black hole,

304
00:23:17,999 --> 00:23:21,770
you could bring the tiniest
pinprick of light.

305
00:23:21,803 --> 00:23:27,609
Tiniest match can lead you all
out of the darkness.

306
00:23:27,642 --> 00:23:31,780
It's what you do with it
that determines what it is.

307
00:23:31,813 --> 00:23:33,915
Magic?

308
00:23:33,949 --> 00:23:35,516
Everything is magic.

309
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:38,820
And there's no such thing
as magic.

310
00:23:38,853 --> 00:23:42,157
I... I'm called Floating Hawk.

311
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:44,626
People say your land is cursed.

312
00:23:44,659 --> 00:23:47,095
One man's curse
is another man's blessing.

313
00:23:47,128 --> 00:23:49,631
I'm not into riddles.
I want my daughter back.

314
00:23:49,664 --> 00:23:51,441
You are not in any position
to be making demands,

315
00:23:51,465 --> 00:23:53,001
are you, Daniel?

316
00:23:53,034 --> 00:23:57,105
And until you are
100% transparent with me,

317
00:23:57,138 --> 00:24:00,842
only then perhaps we can have
a heart-to-heart.

318
00:24:02,844 --> 00:24:05,613
Go. Clear your head.

319
00:24:05,647 --> 00:24:08,383
Then return.

320
00:24:08,416 --> 00:24:10,785
Know this...

321
00:24:10,819 --> 00:24:14,155
Only death can save her.

322
00:24:14,189 --> 00:24:17,125
Only death can set her free.

323
00:24:39,848 --> 00:24:41,416
Harlan?

324
00:24:41,449 --> 00:24:43,551
What happened to bowling night?

325
00:24:43,585 --> 00:24:45,220
The storm?

326
00:24:48,857 --> 00:24:50,458
Harlan?

327
00:25:04,905 --> 00:25:06,707
How can we know what she meant?

328
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:10,277
And why are you <i>so</i> willing
to trust this woman?

329
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,945
You know we made a deal.

330
00:25:11,979 --> 00:25:14,214
We really don't have any
other choice but to honor it.

331
00:25:14,248 --> 00:25:16,250
How's that been working out
for us so far?

332
00:25:16,283 --> 00:25:19,686
Nothing we've ever done
has made any difference.

333
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,422
And what she is suggesting?

334
00:25:21,455 --> 00:25:23,757
Rosalie must die
in order to be saved?

335
00:25:23,791 --> 00:25:24,958
Are you insane?

336
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,360
She didn't say Rosalie must die.

337
00:25:26,393 --> 00:25:28,195
She said, "Only death
will save her."

338
00:25:28,228 --> 00:25:30,030
Something about reclaiming.

339
00:25:30,064 --> 00:25:31,865
I want to go back,
find out more.

340
00:25:31,899 --> 00:25:35,769
Just... Just be open.
That's all I'm asking!

341
00:25:35,803 --> 00:25:37,471
I don't know.

342
00:25:44,078 --> 00:25:45,746
I want our daughter back.

343
00:25:51,118 --> 00:25:52,453
Look at her.

344
00:25:54,621 --> 00:25:56,757
She's gone.

345
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,826
I want her back, too.

346
00:26:02,162 --> 00:26:04,298
Do what you want.

347
00:26:04,331 --> 00:26:06,568
But, in the meantime,

348
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,836
<i>please...</i>

349
00:26:08,869 --> 00:26:11,505
let's just do
what we <i>have</i> to do.

350
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:46,507
Just sell her insurance.

351
00:26:51,812 --> 00:26:53,847
Insurance.

352
00:27:02,322 --> 00:27:04,559
Mrs. Lester?

353
00:27:04,592 --> 00:27:06,160
Hello?

354
00:27:06,193 --> 00:27:07,562
Mrs. Lester?

355
00:27:44,264 --> 00:27:45,732
No, no, no, no, no!

356
00:27:45,766 --> 00:27:47,100
It's impossible.

357
00:27:47,134 --> 00:27:49,503
My mother would never
commit suicide.

358
00:27:49,537 --> 00:27:53,073
She's Catholic.
She would never disobey God.

359
00:27:53,106 --> 00:27:55,909
A-A-And did you see
how high that branch was?

360
00:27:55,943 --> 00:27:58,680
80 year-old woman gonna
c-climb up that?

361
00:27:58,712 --> 00:28:01,515
Give me a break.

362
00:28:11,058 --> 00:28:12,859
Hi. Thank you
for inviting me in.

363
00:28:12,893 --> 00:28:14,394
Lovely day, isn't it?

364
00:28:14,428 --> 00:28:16,396
I think this is gonna save you
a lot of trouble,

365
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:19,466
and mutually beneficial
to the both of us.

366
00:28:19,499 --> 00:28:21,101
What a lovely home.

367
00:28:21,134 --> 00:28:23,036
I hope that you can keep it.

368
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:25,472
I think that you can,
if you sign this.

369
00:28:25,505 --> 00:28:27,975
Well, at this point, I don't
really have a choice, do I?

370
00:28:28,008 --> 00:28:29,443
No, you don't.

371
00:28:29,476 --> 00:28:31,044
Yeah.

372
00:28:31,078 --> 00:28:32,379
Sign.

373
00:28:41,989 --> 00:28:45,425
No graveyard shift tonight?

374
00:28:45,459 --> 00:28:47,060
Day off.

375
00:28:47,094 --> 00:28:48,563
Man, I-I'm sorry.

376
00:28:48,596 --> 00:28:51,431
Nah, I can't sleep.

377
00:28:51,465 --> 00:28:53,300
Beer thirty?

378
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:55,068
Sure.

379
00:28:58,305 --> 00:29:00,774
I know some people already
suspect you for what happened.

380
00:29:00,807 --> 00:29:02,909
But could've been me who went
to her house tonight.

381
00:29:02,943 --> 00:29:06,280
People are crazy.

382
00:29:06,313 --> 00:29:10,585
Mm. That old bat Betty Goss says
shit like, uh,

383
00:29:10,618 --> 00:29:12,119
"All the bad stuff
started happening"

384
00:29:12,152 --> 00:29:14,288
when you guys got here.

385
00:29:14,321 --> 00:29:15,856
Yeah, right, Betty.

386
00:29:15,889 --> 00:29:17,625
Like nothing bad
ever happened here

387
00:29:17,659 --> 00:29:19,826
before the Snyders got here.

388
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:22,764
Get a life,
you bag of smoked lard.

389
00:29:27,467 --> 00:29:29,169
What's eatin' you, brother?

390
00:29:30,638 --> 00:29:33,708
I'm sorry I said all that
about the bad stuff happening...

391
00:29:33,741 --> 00:29:35,842
No, no, it's alright.

392
00:29:35,876 --> 00:29:38,011
It's alright.

393
00:29:38,045 --> 00:29:40,047
Want another one?

394
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,848
Sure.

395
00:29:43,584 --> 00:29:47,655
Yeah, this town's
a cesspool of gossip.

396
00:29:47,689 --> 00:29:49,667
Gotta run to the outside fridge.
Be back in a minute.

397
00:29:49,691 --> 00:29:51,224
Yeah. No prob.

398
00:30:56,089 --> 00:30:57,725
Exploring?

399
00:31:00,494 --> 00:31:02,028
Yeah, yeah.

400
00:31:02,062 --> 00:31:04,364
It looks like you got
some cool relics there.

401
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:06,900
Curious, you know,
where they came from

402
00:31:06,933 --> 00:31:08,902
and, uh, what they mean.

403
00:31:08,935 --> 00:31:10,638
All the relics
have different meanings,

404
00:31:10,671 --> 00:31:14,274
but the coolest one

405
00:31:14,307 --> 00:31:16,577
was the one you were looking at.

406
00:31:16,611 --> 00:31:18,121
How do you know which one
I was looking at?

407
00:31:18,145 --> 00:31:20,046
Because it moved.

408
00:31:22,416 --> 00:31:24,918
Wow. You're good.

409
00:31:24,951 --> 00:31:27,755
No, this particular one
is an ancient relic

410
00:31:27,789 --> 00:31:31,425
discovered in Mesopotamia.

411
00:31:31,458 --> 00:31:34,961
It's said to be a tool of
The Harbinger.

412
00:31:34,995 --> 00:31:40,000
The Harbinger is like a sign
or omen of things to come.

413
00:31:40,033 --> 00:31:42,235
In this particular myth,
the Harbinger

414
00:31:42,269 --> 00:31:45,272
is a traveler doomed to Hell

415
00:31:45,305 --> 00:31:48,341
unless he does
the devil's bidding.

416
00:31:48,375 --> 00:31:51,913
And with him...

417
00:31:51,945 --> 00:31:54,147
comes damnation.

418
00:31:54,181 --> 00:31:56,149
For what purpose?

419
00:31:56,183 --> 00:31:58,084
Try to get as many people
as possible

420
00:31:58,118 --> 00:32:02,155
to kill themselves
so he can claim their souls.

421
00:32:02,189 --> 00:32:04,759
How do they get people
to kill themselves?

422
00:32:04,792 --> 00:32:06,661
The serpent relic.

423
00:32:06,694 --> 00:32:09,196
It's pure evil, forged in Hell,

424
00:32:09,229 --> 00:32:12,199
and influences people
to commit suicide.

425
00:32:12,232 --> 00:32:14,702
The Harbinger's job
is to drop the relic

426
00:32:14,735 --> 00:32:16,838
within the vicinity
of the victims.

427
00:32:16,871 --> 00:32:19,774
Why... Why can't he just
kill the people?

428
00:32:19,807 --> 00:32:22,042
He can, but just because
he kills them

429
00:32:22,075 --> 00:32:23,811
doesn't mean he gets them.

430
00:32:23,845 --> 00:32:28,315
Your only way to true damnation
is through suicide.

431
00:32:28,348 --> 00:32:31,819
And, uh, he'll stop at nothing
to get you there.

432
00:32:31,853 --> 00:32:35,155
He, uh, can't just drop
the relic himself?

433
00:32:35,188 --> 00:32:38,626
Why does he need Harbingers?
- To cover more ground.

434
00:32:38,659 --> 00:32:40,895
He sends one Harbinger
to each town.

435
00:32:40,928 --> 00:32:42,395
But there are too many towns,

436
00:32:42,429 --> 00:32:44,364
so he's always looking
for more Harbingers.

437
00:32:44,397 --> 00:32:47,535
He uses leverage to get people
to sign the contracts,

438
00:32:47,568 --> 00:32:49,737
people who have done bad things

439
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:52,239
or made bad deals,
what have you.

440
00:32:52,272 --> 00:32:55,509
If he can hold something
over your head,

441
00:32:55,543 --> 00:32:57,344
he's got you.

442
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:01,147
So these Harbingers...
They go around

443
00:33:01,181 --> 00:33:03,551
to all these different towns
to get as many people

444
00:33:03,584 --> 00:33:06,319
to off themselves as possible.

445
00:33:06,353 --> 00:33:08,221
And if they don't?

446
00:33:08,255 --> 00:33:09,724
Hell if I know.

447
00:33:09,757 --> 00:33:10,934
Wait a second. Wait a second.

448
00:33:10,958 --> 00:33:13,895
You have the tool
of the Harbinger,

449
00:33:13,928 --> 00:33:17,030
the serpent relic,
in your house.

450
00:33:17,932 --> 00:33:19,767
Why haven't you killed yourself?

451
00:33:25,873 --> 00:33:27,608
You... What...
You don't really believe

452
00:33:27,642 --> 00:33:29,376
all that malarkey, do you?

453
00:33:29,409 --> 00:33:32,713
I mean, I guess if a Catholic
commits suicide,

454
00:33:32,747 --> 00:33:35,048
going against God and all that,

455
00:33:35,081 --> 00:33:37,450
but then again,
to try to get me to believe

456
00:33:37,484 --> 00:33:39,252
that there's some dude
working for the devil

457
00:33:39,286 --> 00:33:42,222
who can make you kill yourself
using some little trinket?

458
00:33:42,255 --> 00:33:45,860
Well, gotta be Linda Lovelace
to swallow that pill.

459
00:33:45,893 --> 00:33:48,361
Makes for a cool story, though.

460
00:33:48,395 --> 00:33:51,531
Ah, here.

461
00:33:56,637 --> 00:33:58,438
You can have this one.

462
00:34:06,246 --> 00:34:09,717
Doesn't do jack shit,
but, uh, well, it looks cool.

463
00:34:34,008 --> 00:34:35,610
What are you guys doing?

464
00:34:47,855 --> 00:34:50,791
Honey, have you seen
my briefcase?

465
00:35:06,674 --> 00:35:08,876
Mr. Snyder.

466
00:35:08,909 --> 00:35:10,845
Uh, Detective Tracy Hennings.

467
00:35:10,878 --> 00:35:12,345
You mind if I have
a quick moment?

468
00:35:12,379 --> 00:35:13,614
Uh, no, not at all.

469
00:35:13,648 --> 00:35:14,849
Uh, I got your statements.

470
00:35:14,882 --> 00:35:16,817
I just wanted to confirm
something.

471
00:35:16,851 --> 00:35:18,862
Now, you said you saw Harlan
<i>after</i> you found Mrs. Lester.

472
00:35:18,886 --> 00:35:20,353
Is that right?

473
00:35:20,387 --> 00:35:21,856
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

474
00:35:21,889 --> 00:35:24,357
I, uh, called out
and no one answered.

475
00:35:24,391 --> 00:35:27,293
Mm. Any chance he could have
been inside the house

476
00:35:27,327 --> 00:35:30,230
and just not answered
when you called out?

477
00:35:30,263 --> 00:35:33,466
I suppose he could have been.
I really don't know.

478
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:36,236
Did... Did you ask him?
- Oh, we will.

479
00:35:36,269 --> 00:35:38,005
We will.

480
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:40,306
You said you're from a town
in Iowa called Huntsville.

481
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:42,076
Is that right?
- Yes. That's right.

482
00:35:42,109 --> 00:35:43,577
Well, here's the thing.

483
00:35:43,611 --> 00:35:46,246
I can't find a Huntsville
in Iowa anywhere.

484
00:35:46,279 --> 00:35:49,516
Well, i-it's, uh, more of
an unincorporated area.

485
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:51,217
I-I just say Des Moines.

486
00:35:51,251 --> 00:35:53,854
Ah! I gotcha.

487
00:35:53,888 --> 00:35:56,423
Ah, just one more thing.

488
00:35:56,456 --> 00:35:57,892
Now, where is it?

489
00:35:57,925 --> 00:36:01,428
Des Moines, huh?
Everybody knows where that is.

490
00:36:01,461 --> 00:36:03,530
Ah, here it is.

491
00:36:03,564 --> 00:36:06,000
Uh, does this mean anything
to you?

492
00:36:06,033 --> 00:36:09,402
Uh, no, sir.
Where'd you find that?

493
00:36:09,436 --> 00:36:12,338
At the crime scene, obviously.

494
00:36:12,372 --> 00:36:14,374
Crime scene?

495
00:36:14,407 --> 00:36:16,409
I thought she committed suicide.

496
00:36:16,443 --> 00:36:18,946
Well, here's another thing.

497
00:36:18,979 --> 00:36:20,781
It's troubling.

498
00:36:20,815 --> 00:36:23,056
How does an 80-year-old woman
get up in a tree like that?

499
00:36:25,318 --> 00:36:28,254
Well, you think of anything
you want to tell me,

500
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:31,257
anything at all, you go ahead
and give me a call.

501
00:36:31,291 --> 00:36:34,061
Thank you, Detective. Will do.

502
00:36:34,095 --> 00:36:35,763
Okay.

503
00:37:18,873 --> 00:37:21,976
What do you want from me?!

504
00:37:42,062 --> 00:37:43,329
What is it?

505
00:37:43,363 --> 00:37:44,865
I can't find the girls anywhere.

506
00:37:44,899 --> 00:37:46,342
They were playing in the back
near the woods,

507
00:37:46,366 --> 00:37:48,169
and I am this close
to calling the police.

508
00:37:49,837 --> 00:37:51,772
- Rosalie!
- Anna!

509
00:37:51,806 --> 00:37:53,306
Mommy!

510
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:55,475
Ah!

511
00:37:55,508 --> 00:37:58,679
Anna!

512
00:37:58,712 --> 00:38:00,446
What did I say
about these tunnels?

513
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,983
I couldn't stop her, Mommy.
She just kept going.

514
00:38:03,017 --> 00:38:05,886
I told her about the ghosts,
and she wouldn't listen.

515
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,721
Ghosts?

516
00:38:07,755 --> 00:38:10,390
Mobsters in the Prohibition Era
used to hide from the cops

517
00:38:10,423 --> 00:38:12,358
in these old mining tunnel
systems.

518
00:38:12,392 --> 00:38:14,360
People like to say
the town is haunted,

519
00:38:14,394 --> 00:38:16,897
but we know that's just stories,
now, don't we, girls?

520
00:38:16,931 --> 00:38:19,066
Yes, Mommy.

521
00:38:21,235 --> 00:38:23,270
Right, Rosalie?

522
00:38:25,206 --> 00:38:27,208
The Harbinger has come.

523
00:38:28,576 --> 00:38:30,978
He is here.

524
00:38:31,011 --> 00:38:32,580
What's a Harbinger?

525
00:38:32,613 --> 00:38:35,683
It's something she read
and keeps repeating.

526
00:38:47,527 --> 00:38:48,896
Have you cleared your head?

527
00:38:48,929 --> 00:38:51,431
Floating Hawk, I have, uh,

528
00:38:51,464 --> 00:38:55,169
never been one
to be 100% transparent.

529
00:38:55,202 --> 00:38:57,605
In my life, I have had

530
00:38:57,638 --> 00:39:00,774
so many people to protect.

531
00:39:00,808 --> 00:39:02,442
But I failed.

532
00:39:02,475 --> 00:39:04,912
Good, Daniel. Keep going.

533
00:39:04,945 --> 00:39:07,848
Nothing personal.
I have trust issues.

534
00:39:07,882 --> 00:39:09,950
I...

535
00:39:09,984 --> 00:39:11,986
I don't know how to say this.

536
00:39:15,122 --> 00:39:16,690
I don't know you.

537
00:39:16,724 --> 00:39:18,092
Surely, you can understand

538
00:39:18,125 --> 00:39:20,526
I am risking everything
by being here.

539
00:39:20,561 --> 00:39:24,031
Little brother,
you've lost everything.

540
00:39:24,064 --> 00:39:26,300
What else do you have to risk?

541
00:39:27,835 --> 00:39:30,938
The devil has
my daughter's soul.

542
00:39:30,971 --> 00:39:34,241
And he has forced me to do
something terrible

543
00:39:34,275 --> 00:39:37,477
in order to get her back.

544
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:38,979
I will go to the ends
of the Earth

545
00:39:39,013 --> 00:39:41,115
to find another way to save her.

546
00:39:41,148 --> 00:39:43,984
Trust goes both ways, Daniel.

547
00:39:44,018 --> 00:39:46,820
I still can't see all of you.

548
00:39:46,854 --> 00:39:49,957
But I know what you say is true.

549
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:55,296
There is no prayer or chant
or spell or song

550
00:39:55,329 --> 00:39:57,564
that can save your daughter.

551
00:39:59,266 --> 00:40:01,467
Are you going to drown
in a puddle of tears,

552
00:40:01,501 --> 00:40:03,237
or do you want to
try another way?

553
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:05,105
Hmm?

554
00:40:05,139 --> 00:40:08,175
What I'm about to tell you
has never been verified,

555
00:40:08,208 --> 00:40:09,977
not by me anyway.

556
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:12,613
Your people have a legend
of Ehud the Judge.

557
00:40:12,646 --> 00:40:14,648
You know it?

558
00:40:14,682 --> 00:40:19,819
An evil, fat king was killed
by a servant of God,

559
00:40:19,852 --> 00:40:23,488
and the dagger expelled
the filth and dirt

560
00:40:23,522 --> 00:40:26,159
from the king before he died.

561
00:40:26,192 --> 00:40:30,763
As a girl, our elders told us
the story of that blessed dagger

562
00:40:30,797 --> 00:40:32,999
being brought here by pilgrims.

563
00:40:33,032 --> 00:40:35,868
It is now next to
the Auclair crypt

564
00:40:35,902 --> 00:40:38,137
underneath the oval stone.

565
00:40:38,171 --> 00:40:41,374
Our people respect the story
and never go near it.

566
00:40:41,407 --> 00:40:45,144
Are you saying
a dagger to stab the devil?

567
00:40:45,178 --> 00:40:47,814
No.

568
00:40:47,847 --> 00:40:50,717
According to legend...

569
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:52,418
your daughter.

570
00:40:56,055 --> 00:40:57,824
"Only death will save her."

571
00:40:57,857 --> 00:40:59,192
My daughter has to die?!

572
00:40:59,225 --> 00:41:01,493
What the story
doesn't tell you...

573
00:41:01,526 --> 00:41:04,030
It's the evil that dies.

574
00:41:04,063 --> 00:41:07,734
But if the evil is expelled
and good remains,

575
00:41:07,767 --> 00:41:09,769
true life returns.

576
00:41:11,938 --> 00:41:14,007
That's a story.

577
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,175
There's no dagger.

578
00:41:16,209 --> 00:41:18,978
Trust.

579
00:41:19,012 --> 00:41:21,214
But verify.

580
00:41:21,247 --> 00:41:25,517
If I stab my daughter
with a dagger, she's dead.

581
00:41:25,551 --> 00:41:29,722
Yes, but there are two things
you must consider.

582
00:41:29,756 --> 00:41:33,026
One... you have no other option.

583
00:41:33,059 --> 00:41:36,396
And two... she's already dead.

584
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:38,057
<i>That blessed dagger is now
by the Auclair crypt,</i>

585
00:42:38,091 --> 00:42:39,992
<i>underneath the oval stone.</i>

586
00:43:00,213 --> 00:43:02,682
Ah!

587
00:43:02,715 --> 00:43:04,250
What brings you to the party?

588
00:43:04,283 --> 00:43:07,253
You can't possibly know
anyone here, can you?

589
00:43:07,286 --> 00:43:09,155
Oh! Shit.

590
00:43:09,188 --> 00:43:10,957
How can I be such an idiot?

591
00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:13,860
Mrs. Lester, right?

592
00:43:13,893 --> 00:43:15,962
Uh, yeah.

593
00:43:15,995 --> 00:43:18,498
I'm sorry you had to be
the one to find her, man.

594
00:43:20,366 --> 00:43:23,669
Come on.
Mrs. Lester's buried this way.

595
00:43:25,671 --> 00:43:29,308
That other half of the cemetery
is on Indian land.

596
00:43:29,342 --> 00:43:32,278
Supposedly cursed,
like they said the other night.

597
00:43:32,311 --> 00:43:34,447
I don't really believe
that crap, but, uh,

598
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:40,286
still, you, uh, don't ever
want to dip a toe on that side,

599
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:43,289
not because it's cursed,
but, uh,

600
00:43:43,322 --> 00:43:45,191
because then you have to
deal with them.

601
00:43:45,224 --> 00:43:48,227
Eh, and don't ever talk to them.

602
00:43:48,261 --> 00:43:49,795
I don't really believe
they're evil,

603
00:43:49,829 --> 00:43:52,398
but, uh, the ones not getting
the casino money

604
00:43:52,431 --> 00:43:54,901
are just looking for a handout.

605
00:43:54,934 --> 00:43:56,802
Trust me.

606
00:43:56,836 --> 00:44:02,375
Well, I'm, uh... I'm really
sorry about Mrs. Lester.

607
00:44:02,408 --> 00:44:05,878
If... If you don't mind,
I'm gonna stroll around.

608
00:44:05,912 --> 00:44:09,215
I'm kind of a history buff.

609
00:44:09,248 --> 00:44:11,083
You got it.

610
00:44:11,117 --> 00:44:13,186
Don't beat yourself up, bud.

611
00:44:13,219 --> 00:44:15,188
Thanks, John.

612
00:44:57,631 --> 00:44:59,899
Oh, God, no.

613
00:45:12,178 --> 00:45:15,481
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

614
00:45:15,514 --> 00:45:17,950
Amen. Go in peace, my child.

615
00:45:17,984 --> 00:45:20,286
Would you bless this, too,
Father?

616
00:45:27,293 --> 00:45:31,330
You must leave these premises.

617
00:45:31,364 --> 00:45:34,601
I assure you
she is a sweet child.

618
00:45:35,835 --> 00:45:37,970
She's just a little lost.

619
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:43,442
Please bless us.

620
00:45:44,810 --> 00:45:46,946
Leave this place!

621
00:46:03,697 --> 00:46:05,364
<i>The death of Irene Lester</i>

622
00:46:05,398 --> 00:46:07,109
<i>has sent shock waves
throughout the community.</i>

623
00:46:07,133 --> 00:46:09,670
<i>Lester was found hanging
in her backyard.</i>

624
00:46:09,703 --> 00:46:11,772
<i>Authorities

625
00:46:11,804 --> 00:46:13,640
<i>but ask to keep speculation
to a minimum</i>

626
00:46:13,674 --> 00:46:16,375

627
00:46:16,409 --> 00:46:17,977
<i>In other news, a new report</i>

630

<i>Now back to St. Herald son's
greatest hits on WDDL.</i>

631
00:46:50,276 --> 00:46:52,178
Hi, Grandpa!

632
00:47:08,961 --> 00:47:11,230
No, no, no, we don't sell
that kind of insurance.

633
00:47:11,263 --> 00:47:13,199
Let me show you
what we're talking about.

634
00:47:13,232 --> 00:47:14,735
No need. I trust you.

635
00:47:14,768 --> 00:47:16,869
No, no, no, no, no.

636
00:47:16,902 --> 00:47:19,606
I insist.

637
00:47:24,944 --> 00:47:28,180
Dry up and go chase yourself,
bub.

638
00:47:28,214 --> 00:47:30,182
<i>Daniel...</i>

639
00:47:57,577 --> 00:48:00,980
Extra, extra!
Read all about it!

640
00:48:10,857 --> 00:48:12,659
Did you close the Mayer account?

641
00:48:12,692 --> 00:48:14,393
Got interrupted.

642
00:48:14,427 --> 00:48:15,829
Well, it's always something.

643
00:48:15,862 --> 00:48:17,731
His granddaughter showed up.

644
00:48:17,764 --> 00:48:19,599
I can't bring myself to do
any of these jobs.

645
00:48:19,633 --> 00:48:22,168
You don't have a choice.

646
00:48:22,201 --> 00:48:26,005
Just do the job
so that we can get her back.

647
00:48:26,038 --> 00:48:28,474
I can't. I <i>won't.</i>

648
00:48:28,507 --> 00:48:30,744
I <i>have</i> to find another way.

649
00:48:30,777 --> 00:48:34,079
When are you gonna accept
there <i>is</i> no other way?

650
00:48:34,113 --> 00:48:37,651
Never.
I will never accept that.

651
00:48:37,684 --> 00:48:40,921
What you're toying with,
the risk...

652
00:48:40,953 --> 00:48:43,590
It's... it's just too high.
- How can you say that?!

653
00:48:43,623 --> 00:48:45,324
You know, if you hadn't made

654
00:48:45,357 --> 00:48:47,761
certain decisions
with your life,

655
00:48:47,794 --> 00:48:50,129
we wouldn't be making this one
right now.

656
00:48:50,162 --> 00:48:52,933
Hey! I loved her, too!

657
00:48:52,965 --> 00:48:55,702
You think it doesn't torment me
every day?!

658
00:48:55,735 --> 00:48:59,472
I go to sleep every night,
and I see her smiling face.

659
00:48:59,505 --> 00:49:03,108
I wake up thinking I'm gonna
see it again, only to realize

660
00:49:03,142 --> 00:49:06,345
I'm in the same Goddamn
repeating nightmare!

661
00:49:06,378 --> 00:49:08,380
And you don't think I miss her?!

662
00:49:08,414 --> 00:49:11,551
You don't think I'm heartbroken?
We are living in Hell on Earth.

663
00:49:11,585 --> 00:49:13,185
<i>Daniel...</i>

664
00:49:19,091 --> 00:49:20,961
Baby, what's wrong?

665
00:49:20,993 --> 00:49:23,663
I know of whom you speak.

666
00:49:23,697 --> 00:49:26,298
Mommy and Daddy
are not upset with you.

667
00:49:30,837 --> 00:49:32,539
Where did you get that?

668
00:49:34,106 --> 00:49:36,375
The end of the tunnel.

669
00:50:19,051 --> 00:50:20,754
Daniel?

670
00:50:20,787 --> 00:50:22,388
What happened?

671
00:50:25,959 --> 00:50:30,429
It was awful, Theresa.

672
00:50:30,462 --> 00:50:33,432
But I have to.

673
00:50:33,465 --> 00:50:36,036
I have to.

674
00:50:51,116 --> 00:50:54,754
What can you tell me
about these objects?

675
00:51:00,961 --> 00:51:03,462
You need to be very careful,
Daniel.

676
00:51:03,495 --> 00:51:05,097
In the wrong hands,

677
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:09,468
these objects are dangerous,

678
00:51:09,501 --> 00:51:12,739
deadly,

679
00:51:12,772 --> 00:51:14,941
otherworldly.

680
00:51:14,975 --> 00:51:17,644
You know the Harbinger myth?

681
00:51:17,677 --> 00:51:21,146
I'm told one of these is
the tool of The Harbinger.

682
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:26,987
This is the tool
of The Harbinger.

683
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:29,321
I got something else for you.

684
00:51:37,496 --> 00:51:40,332
You <i>are</i> a do-er, Daniel.

685
00:51:40,366 --> 00:51:42,134
And you acquired this how?

686
00:51:42,167 --> 00:51:44,236
My daughter says she found it
in the tunnels.

687
00:51:47,306 --> 00:51:48,975
What?

688
00:51:49,009 --> 00:51:51,811
Is there a way to test it?

689
00:51:51,845 --> 00:51:54,146
I don't know.

690
00:51:54,179 --> 00:51:57,349
I can't see.

691
00:51:57,383 --> 00:52:00,987
Part of the problem
is not the dagger.

692
00:52:01,021 --> 00:52:02,656
It's you.

693
00:52:05,825 --> 00:52:07,426
Let me see.

694
00:52:17,871 --> 00:52:19,304
I washed my hands.

695
00:52:19,338 --> 00:52:22,075
It doesn't matter.
It's inappropriate.

696
00:52:22,108 --> 00:52:24,878
- Yeah, Daddy.
- Yeah.

697
00:52:24,911 --> 00:52:26,012
Whoa. Easy.

698
00:52:26,046 --> 00:52:28,213
- Oh!
- What are you doing?

699
00:52:28,247 --> 00:52:29,849
Really?

700
00:52:29,883 --> 00:52:31,851
I had it,
but you over corrected.

701
00:52:31,885 --> 00:52:35,521
Mm. Really?
How about you try some?

702
00:52:35,555 --> 00:52:38,257
Oh! Somebody's toast!

703
00:52:38,290 --> 00:52:39,592
She's toast!

704
00:52:39,626 --> 00:52:41,393
No, no, no!

705
00:52:45,531 --> 00:52:47,232
Your love is strong.

706
00:52:47,266 --> 00:52:50,603
Hey, this is actually
really good. Try some.

707
00:52:50,637 --> 00:52:52,337
Aah!

708
00:52:52,371 --> 00:52:56,341
Oh, we got two burnt pieces
of toast coming right up!

709
00:53:16,295 --> 00:53:19,264
The bald man...

710
00:53:19,298 --> 00:53:21,134
He scares you.

711
00:53:23,435 --> 00:53:25,605
Come back when you are ready
to face him.

712
00:53:27,907 --> 00:53:31,111
Keep this safe.

713
00:54:40,914 --> 00:54:43,983
Can you think of any enemies
you may have made

714
00:54:44,017 --> 00:54:45,885
since you arrived to town?

715
00:54:45,919 --> 00:54:47,519
No.

716
00:54:47,554 --> 00:54:49,722
Well, I will compile all this
in my report, ma'am,

717
00:54:49,756 --> 00:54:53,226
and get it submitted ASAP.

718
00:54:53,259 --> 00:54:55,394
I'll just leave my card here
on the table.

719
00:54:58,665 --> 00:55:00,332
Thank you, Officer.

720
00:55:31,764 --> 00:55:35,601
You just gonna spy on me
and my wife for eternity?

721
00:55:35,634 --> 00:55:38,103
I have nothing to say to you.

722
00:55:38,136 --> 00:55:41,006
I didn't kill your mother.

723
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:43,976
Hey, neighbies. What's cookin'?

724
00:55:50,916 --> 00:55:54,219
Give him time, Daniel.

725
00:56:58,116 --> 00:57:01,787
<i>Daniel...</i>

726
00:57:10,963 --> 00:57:13,632
<i>Daniel...</i>

727
00:57:38,323 --> 00:57:40,225
Hi, honey.

728
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:44,363
Do you remember your daughter?

729
00:57:46,331 --> 00:57:48,066
Yes.

730
00:57:52,270 --> 00:57:54,706
Very much so.

731
00:57:55,207 --> 00:57:56,908
Do you?

732
00:57:59,244 --> 00:58:01,179
Not really.

733
00:58:33,245 --> 00:58:36,715
Please sleep,
my baby darling girl.

734
00:59:09,181 --> 00:59:12,951
Aah!

735
00:59:18,657 --> 00:59:20,725
Oh, my God.

736
00:59:40,312 --> 00:59:42,414
Police are investigating...

737
00:59:50,455 --> 00:59:52,023
What happened?

738
00:59:52,057 --> 00:59:53,593
Like you don't know.

739
00:59:53,625 --> 00:59:55,760
Stabbed in the eyes
with a letter opener.

740
00:59:55,794 --> 00:59:58,163
Ma'am, let the investigation
disclose.

741
00:59:58,196 --> 01:00:00,665
You are not welcome
in this town!

742
01:00:00,699 --> 01:00:03,536
Take your murdering husband
and freak daughter

743
01:00:03,569 --> 01:00:05,504
and get the hell outta here!
- Ma'am, relax.

744
01:00:05,538 --> 01:00:08,373
Yeah, put your tail between
your legs and run, bitch!

745
01:00:08,406 --> 01:00:10,041
Mr. Snyder!

746
01:00:15,313 --> 01:00:17,883
Detective.

747
01:00:17,916 --> 01:00:20,051
Talk soon.

748
01:00:47,245 --> 01:00:48,581
Oh.

749
01:00:48,614 --> 01:00:50,749
You didn't get my text?

750
01:00:50,782 --> 01:00:52,552
No.

751
01:00:52,585 --> 01:00:57,722
Uh... just with all of
the insanity,

752
01:00:57,756 --> 01:01:00,325
Betty thought...

753
01:01:00,358 --> 01:01:03,695
<i>I</i> think that we should just wait

754
01:01:03,728 --> 01:01:05,530
for this whole thing
to blow over

755
01:01:05,565 --> 01:01:08,166
before the girls...
- Betty thought?

756
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:10,068
W-What whole thing?

757
01:01:10,101 --> 01:01:14,540
Theresa, please don't do this.

758
01:01:14,574 --> 01:01:18,276
You have to admit that
Rosalie's...

759
01:01:18,310 --> 01:01:20,512
I have to go.

760
01:01:20,546 --> 01:01:22,514
Wh...

761
01:01:22,548 --> 01:01:24,416
Alice!

762
01:01:24,449 --> 01:01:26,985
It's a play date,
for God's sake!

763
01:01:29,154 --> 01:01:32,724
Go to hell, Alice!
You go to hell!

764
01:01:38,598 --> 01:01:41,733
Betty is a mean person.

765
01:01:41,766 --> 01:01:44,302
She will receive a comeuppance.

766
01:01:51,109 --> 01:01:54,312
She's just scared, Theresa.
The whole town's on edge.

767
01:02:00,686 --> 01:02:02,655
Hello.

768
01:02:02,688 --> 01:02:04,322
Oh, evening, Detective.

769
01:02:06,592 --> 01:02:08,159
Oh.

770
01:02:10,462 --> 01:02:12,297
I see.

771
01:02:12,330 --> 01:02:13,932
I'll be... I'll be right there.

772
01:02:13,965 --> 01:02:18,770
He says Betty drove her car
off a cliff.

773
01:02:27,312 --> 01:02:30,650
Come on, Daniel,
just level with me.

774
01:02:30,683 --> 01:02:32,618
Help me help you.

775
01:02:32,652 --> 01:02:34,352
I have no explanation,
Detective.

776
01:02:34,386 --> 01:02:36,689
That's not gonna be good enough.

777
01:02:36,722 --> 01:02:39,924
Now, you're either committing
these acts, or you know who is,

778
01:02:39,958 --> 01:02:43,528
unless you got someone who
really just doesn't like you.

779
01:02:43,562 --> 01:02:45,497
I can't think of anyone.

780
01:02:48,867 --> 01:02:50,335
All right.

781
01:02:50,368 --> 01:02:51,836
What do you know about this?

782
01:02:51,870 --> 01:02:54,506
Found that in Betty's car.

783
01:03:07,185 --> 01:03:09,689
What is that?
What's that look on your face?

784
01:03:09,722 --> 01:03:11,657
This doesn't make any sense.

785
01:03:11,691 --> 01:03:13,458
Well, no shit, Shirley.

786
01:03:13,491 --> 01:03:15,160
Don't you think
it's in your best interest

787
01:03:15,193 --> 01:03:16,696
to just tell me what you know?

788
01:03:16,729 --> 01:03:20,733
I'm sorry, Detective.
I-I have no clue. This...

789
01:03:20,766 --> 01:03:23,536
Now, how do I know I'm gonna
find your DNA on this one, too?

790
01:03:23,569 --> 01:03:25,671
You know, this is cause
for a warrant right here.

791
01:03:25,705 --> 01:03:27,707
I was hoping you'd be
a little more cooperative.

792
01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:29,917
I have no problem with you
obtaining a warrant, Detective.

793
01:03:29,941 --> 01:03:32,877
I have nothing to hide.

794
01:04:20,925 --> 01:04:23,061
I've been seeing things.

795
01:04:23,094 --> 01:04:26,532
I always do.

796
01:04:26,565 --> 01:04:29,134
What kind of things, sweetie?

797
01:04:29,167 --> 01:04:32,303
You know, if you wanted
to talk to us about anything,

798
01:04:32,337 --> 01:04:35,373
ever, we're here for you.

799
01:04:35,407 --> 01:04:37,976
You know that, right?

800
01:04:38,009 --> 01:04:41,212
There once was a cockroach
and a fly.

801
01:04:41,246 --> 01:04:43,616
The fly said to the cockroach,

802
01:04:43,649 --> 01:04:45,483
"If you come into the house
with me,

803
01:04:45,517 --> 01:04:48,486
I'll share my take with you."

804
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:51,956
The cockroach said, "Sure,"
and went in with the fly.

805
01:04:53,692 --> 01:04:55,594
As soon as they were
in the door,

806
01:04:55,628 --> 01:04:58,731
a boot smashed the cockroach.

807
01:04:58,764 --> 01:05:00,965
The fly flew to the kitchen,

808
01:05:00,999 --> 01:05:02,910
grabbed a piece of rancid
meat out of the garbage,

809
01:05:02,934 --> 01:05:05,970
and flew to the door.

810
01:05:06,004 --> 01:05:10,175
But before he made it out
the door, it shut.

811
01:05:10,208 --> 01:05:12,510
The fly landed on the door,

812
01:05:12,545 --> 01:05:15,947
waiting for an opportunity
to escape.

813
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:19,417
Then, smack!

814
01:05:19,451 --> 01:05:22,888
A fly swatter splatted the fly's
guts all over the door.

815
01:05:24,557 --> 01:05:28,426
What's the point
of the story, honey?

816
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:32,932
It doesn't matter if you are
the cockroach or the fly.

817
01:05:32,964 --> 01:05:35,601
We all end up the same way.

818
01:05:39,504 --> 01:05:41,674
Good night.

819
01:05:43,341 --> 01:05:46,579
My baby.

820
01:05:52,317 --> 01:05:54,820
Whoa-ho-ho-ho! Ho!

821
01:05:54,854 --> 01:05:57,188
Oh, hey, Danny.
Look what I got.

822
01:05:57,222 --> 01:05:59,457
Ask and you shall receive.

823
01:05:59,491 --> 01:06:02,126
- Are you Snyder?
- Yes, sir.

824
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:04,697
I'm Sam Watkins,
a code investigator.

825
01:06:04,730 --> 01:06:06,732
Your fence is not up to code,

826
01:06:06,765 --> 01:06:08,399
and your garage
is not up to code,

827
01:06:08,433 --> 01:06:10,569
and I have a city permit

828
01:06:10,603 --> 01:06:13,906
to inspect your house.

829
01:06:13,939 --> 01:06:16,842
Oh, this is such petty bullshit!

830
01:06:16,876 --> 01:06:19,043
When it rains it pours.
Go ahead, guys.

831
01:06:19,077 --> 01:06:20,478
Search the premises.

832
01:06:20,512 --> 01:06:23,047
Search the place.
You, too, for all I care.

833
01:06:23,081 --> 01:06:25,684
But, let's just call this
what it is... a witch hunt!

834
01:06:25,718 --> 01:06:27,352
Well, whatever you want.

835
01:06:27,385 --> 01:06:28,721
What's the problem?

836
01:06:28,754 --> 01:06:30,756
Repo. Pay your bills, man.

837
01:06:30,789 --> 01:06:33,859
- I'm current on my loan.
- Not my problem.

838
01:06:33,893 --> 01:06:36,662
I knew you'd be behind all this.

839
01:06:36,695 --> 01:06:38,329
Oh, let's see what we got.

840
01:06:38,363 --> 01:06:41,266
He's got one of those snake
sticks in his briefcase.

841
01:06:41,299 --> 01:06:43,401
Daniel Snyder,
you're under arrest.

842
01:06:43,434 --> 01:06:45,036
You have the right
to remain silent.

843
01:06:45,069 --> 01:06:46,581
Anything you do and say
can be used against you

844
01:06:46,605 --> 01:06:48,215
in a court of law.
You have a right to an attorney.

845
01:06:48,239 --> 01:06:50,943
- What's the charge?
- Murder.

846
01:06:50,976 --> 01:06:54,613
The murders of Irene Lester,
Harlan Lester, and Betty Goss.

847
01:06:54,647 --> 01:06:55,714
You got him?
- Yep.

848
01:06:55,748 --> 01:06:57,181
Get him in the car.

849
01:07:16,334 --> 01:07:18,737
Ah!

850
01:07:18,771 --> 01:07:22,307
<i>Theresa...</i>

851
01:07:38,189 --> 01:07:41,292
<i>Theresa...</i>

852
01:07:57,643 --> 01:08:00,646
<i>There's only one way
to mend this.</i>

853
01:08:15,193 --> 01:08:18,262
We have your briefcase
and your little stick.

854
01:08:18,296 --> 01:08:21,700
You wanna tell me...

855
01:08:21,734 --> 01:08:24,103
why you have
insurance policies in it

856
01:08:24,135 --> 01:08:26,672
that expired three years ago?

857
01:08:27,338 --> 01:08:30,109
That's a crime?

858
01:08:30,141 --> 01:08:32,611
All right, let's talk turkey.

859
01:08:32,645 --> 01:08:36,048
You plead guilty...
No death penalty.

860
01:08:36,081 --> 01:08:39,985
I have done nothing.
I swear it.

861
01:08:40,019 --> 01:08:41,720
And I want my phone call.

862
01:08:52,998 --> 01:08:54,533
Wow, neighbor.

863
01:08:54,566 --> 01:08:56,200
World of shit, huh?

864
01:08:59,504 --> 01:09:01,215
John, there's something
serious I have to tell you.

865
01:09:01,239 --> 01:09:03,042
I don't know how to say it,
but I have to.

866
01:09:03,075 --> 01:09:05,176
Jesus. What is it?

867
01:09:05,209 --> 01:09:06,879
Theresa and I have a past.

868
01:09:08,847 --> 01:09:10,983
I guess we all do.

869
01:09:11,016 --> 01:09:14,252
What, did you kill someone?

870
01:09:14,285 --> 01:09:16,588
My background is in finance.

871
01:09:18,624 --> 01:09:21,225
I was approached by
a businessman with a proposal.

872
01:09:23,394 --> 01:09:26,330
If we're smart about it,

873
01:09:26,364 --> 01:09:30,736
the ROI for our investors
is above 1,000%.

874
01:09:30,769 --> 01:09:32,538
We ran a Ponzi scheme
on Wall Street.

875
01:09:32,571 --> 01:09:35,406
We and our investors...
We made millions.

876
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:37,109
I didn't know what a Ponzi was.

877
01:09:37,142 --> 01:09:39,410
I just knew that it was
beautiful, until it wasn't.

878
01:09:39,444 --> 01:09:40,879
And just like Bernie Madoff
said,

879
01:09:40,913 --> 01:09:42,781
it didn't start off
with bad intentions.

880
01:09:42,815 --> 01:09:45,516
But, as so often happens,
shit spiraled out of control.

881
01:09:45,551 --> 01:09:47,418
We couldn't pay back investors.

882
01:09:47,452 --> 01:09:50,189
We were screwed.
The investors were screwed.

883
01:09:50,221 --> 01:09:51,890
My partner and I
were heading for prison.

884
01:09:51,924 --> 01:09:54,960
Theresa and I knew it.

885
01:09:54,993 --> 01:09:58,897
One day, a man showed up
at our door.

886
01:09:58,931 --> 01:10:00,742
I don't want to go into detail
about how horrifying

887
01:10:00,766 --> 01:10:03,635
this particular individual is,
but he offered me a deal.

888
01:10:03,669 --> 01:10:06,071
And mutually beneficial
to the both of us.

889
01:10:06,105 --> 01:10:08,140
He said I could avoid
going to jail.

890
01:10:08,173 --> 01:10:11,110
He'd pay back all my investors
on one condition...

891
01:10:11,143 --> 01:10:13,212
I had to do a job for him.

892
01:10:13,244 --> 01:10:17,248
Do you remember telling me
the story of The Harbinger?

893
01:10:17,281 --> 01:10:18,984
Y-Yeah.

894
01:10:19,017 --> 01:10:21,452
How much do you believe it?

895
01:10:21,486 --> 01:10:24,890
About as much as I believe
in Santa Claus. Why?

896
01:10:24,923 --> 01:10:27,926
This man told me
if I did this job,

897
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:30,261
my family would never be
in financial danger again.

898
01:10:30,294 --> 01:10:31,930
Now, the job is unspeakable.

899
01:10:31,964 --> 01:10:33,397
I couldn't bring myself
to do it,

900
01:10:33,431 --> 01:10:36,101
even if it meant
avoiding poverty and prison.

901
01:10:36,135 --> 01:10:38,269
When he realized this,

902
01:10:38,302 --> 01:10:42,107
he took my daughter's spirit
until the job is done.

903
01:10:44,009 --> 01:10:46,511
Your daughter's spirit?

904
01:10:46,545 --> 01:10:49,447
What if I were to tell you
Santa Claus is real?

905
01:10:53,986 --> 01:10:58,089
You... Wh... You're telling me
there's a Harbinger?

906
01:10:58,122 --> 01:11:00,658
I'll tell you everything if
you are willing to hear me out.

907
01:11:00,691 --> 01:11:03,194
Answer first. You're saying
there <i>is</i> a Harbinger.

908
01:11:03,227 --> 01:11:04,772
I need to know
you're gonna hear me out.

909
01:11:04,796 --> 01:11:06,998
You first, or I'm walking
through that door.

910
01:11:07,031 --> 01:11:08,699
You're saying
there's a Harbinger.

911
01:11:08,733 --> 01:11:11,669
No, John, I'm telling you
<i>I'm</i> The Harbinger.

912
01:11:11,702 --> 01:11:13,171
But I want out.

913
01:11:13,204 --> 01:11:14,872
<i>My mother would never
commit suicide.</i>

914
01:11:14,906 --> 01:11:17,307
<i>She's Catholic.
- Can you think of any enemies</i>

915
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:18,986
<i>you may have made?
- Found that in Betty's car.</i>

916
01:11:19,010 --> 01:11:20,878
<i>Stabbed in the eyes
with a letter opener.</i>

917
01:11:20,912 --> 01:11:22,947
I came here to do these things.

918
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:24,682
I couldn't bring myself
to do them,

919
01:11:24,715 --> 01:11:28,019
which means
someone <i>else</i> is doing it.

920
01:11:28,052 --> 01:11:29,687
I need your help.

921
01:11:31,055 --> 01:11:33,891
Uh... why am I here
and not your wife?

922
01:11:33,925 --> 01:11:35,525
What does she think
about all this?

923
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:37,470
She's part of it.
My family needs your help, John.

924
01:11:37,494 --> 01:11:39,797
I figured <i>you</i> of all people
would believe me.

925
01:11:39,831 --> 01:11:42,867
You know the story.
You have the relics!

926
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:44,501
But they're replicas.

927
01:11:44,535 --> 01:11:46,671
They came with little...
Uh, little booklets.

928
01:11:46,704 --> 01:11:49,207
I got 'em for a dollar each
at a yard sale.

929
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:51,909
I-If you told me this when
you weren't in trouble,

930
01:11:51,943 --> 01:11:53,854
I still would have thought
you were bat shit crazy,

931
01:11:53,878 --> 01:11:57,514
but, uh, now that you're sinking
without a lifeboat, mm.

932
01:11:57,548 --> 01:11:59,217
John, no. Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait!

933
01:11:59,250 --> 01:12:01,418
He says if I take enough souls,
we get Rosalie back.

934
01:12:01,451 --> 01:12:03,221
But he's a con!

935
01:12:03,254 --> 01:12:06,190
I-I may have another way to save
her, but I need out of here!

936
01:12:06,224 --> 01:12:09,560
John! There is no one else
I can go to!

937
01:12:11,394 --> 01:12:13,231
I'm sorry, Daniel.

938
01:12:19,604 --> 01:12:21,772
Ugh!

939
01:12:27,044 --> 01:12:30,047
You sure you didn't make
more than one phone call?

940
01:12:30,081 --> 01:12:33,383
You made bail.
Must have a guardian angel.

941
01:13:00,244 --> 01:13:01,913
Hey!

942
01:13:09,820 --> 01:13:11,289
Hey!

943
01:13:11,322 --> 01:13:14,325
I need to talk to you!

944
01:13:25,603 --> 01:13:28,172
How much time do I have
before she's gone?

945
01:13:33,044 --> 01:13:35,179
Do I have any time?

946
01:14:01,005 --> 01:14:03,207
The bald man.

947
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:05,776
I'm ready to face him.

948
01:14:05,810 --> 01:14:08,012
I have been waiting
for this moment.

949
01:14:08,045 --> 01:14:10,114
First I have a confession
to make.

950
01:14:10,147 --> 01:14:11,849
I know who you are.
I know what you are.

951
01:14:11,882 --> 01:14:13,384
If you know what I am,

952
01:14:13,417 --> 01:14:15,518
you know
I'm not the only one here.

953
01:14:15,553 --> 01:14:17,788
I need your help.

954
01:14:17,822 --> 01:14:21,225
What are you not telling me?!

955
01:14:21,258 --> 01:14:23,828
Come and have some tea, Daniel.

956
01:14:29,700 --> 01:14:33,371
You're a tough one, Daniel.

957
01:14:33,404 --> 01:14:36,040
You're still a bit...

958
01:14:36,073 --> 01:14:37,808
hidden from me.

959
01:14:37,842 --> 01:14:40,845
But your heart and your will
are here.

960
01:14:44,248 --> 01:14:46,017
Here you go.

961
01:14:48,119 --> 01:14:50,321
And here we go.

962
01:14:50,354 --> 01:14:56,027
In 1647, the first white
fur traders arrived here.

963
01:14:56,060 --> 01:14:58,662
The settlers were not
far behind.

964
01:14:58,696 --> 01:15:00,831
They did not understand
our ways,

965
01:15:00,865 --> 01:15:04,502
and we certainly
did not understand theirs.

966
01:15:04,535 --> 01:15:07,938
Along with them came
their illnesses, mythology,

967
01:15:07,972 --> 01:15:11,108
their deity, and, of course,

968
01:15:11,142 --> 01:15:13,210
their anti-deity.

969
01:15:15,646 --> 01:15:18,682
But Luc, or Lucifer
as he was called then,

970
01:15:18,716 --> 01:15:20,785
was new to this world as well.

971
01:15:23,621 --> 01:15:25,790
He didn't understand
that some land

972
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:29,460
was our sacred burial ground.

973
01:15:29,493 --> 01:15:32,029
He had to learn the hard way.

974
01:15:32,063 --> 01:15:35,132
Because he knew he had no power
on our domain...

975
01:15:35,166 --> 01:15:38,102
...over time he made a promise

976
01:15:38,135 --> 01:15:41,872
to leave our people alone,

977
01:15:41,906 --> 01:15:45,376
and he guaranteed it
with an official treaty ceremony

978
01:15:45,409 --> 01:15:48,079
taking place with him
on his land,

979
01:15:48,112 --> 01:15:50,948
and our people on ours.

980
01:15:50,981 --> 01:15:53,818
But naturally,
he broke his promise.

981
01:15:53,851 --> 01:15:56,253
Whenever one of us
ventured off our land,

982
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:59,790
he took advantage.

983
01:15:59,824 --> 01:16:04,995
Through the years, Luc learned
where he had power,

984
01:16:05,029 --> 01:16:07,398
where he did not.

985
01:16:07,431 --> 01:16:11,168
Our people cursed him,
along with his followers

986
01:16:11,202 --> 01:16:13,737
and those who disturbed
our grounds.

987
01:16:13,771 --> 01:16:18,109
From then on, Luc dared not
cross the boundary.

988
01:16:18,142 --> 01:16:21,178
Although <i>he</i> learned
the lay of the land,

989
01:16:21,212 --> 01:16:23,914
the settlers did not.

990
01:16:23,948 --> 01:16:28,119
Time and time again,
and across generations,

991
01:16:28,152 --> 01:16:31,288
they buried their dead
on sacred ground.

992
01:16:31,322 --> 01:16:35,526
These souls could not be claimed
by Luc <i>or</i> God.

993
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:37,962
Your people are right.

994
01:16:37,995 --> 01:16:40,197
They <i>are</i> cursed.

995
01:16:40,231 --> 01:16:42,766
Luc had quite the silver tongue.

996
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:45,803
He promised that
if they collected enough souls,

997
01:16:45,836 --> 01:16:48,139
he would lift the curse.

998
01:16:48,172 --> 01:16:51,610
But no matter how many souls
The Harbingers collect,

999
01:16:51,642 --> 01:16:55,312
it is never enough.

1000
01:16:55,346 --> 01:16:57,014
He tricked 'em.

1001
01:16:57,047 --> 01:16:59,618
And that does not bode well
for you,

1002
01:16:59,650 --> 01:17:02,052
my poor, poor, dear boy.

1003
01:17:05,256 --> 01:17:07,057
Give it to me.

1004
01:17:09,827 --> 01:17:13,464
This is the dagger
made by your God.

1005
01:17:13,497 --> 01:17:16,700
To resurrect her,
you must plunge the dagger

1006
01:17:16,734 --> 01:17:18,736
deep into her chest.

1007
01:17:18,769 --> 01:17:22,973
The evil will pour from her,
expelling the dagger.

1008
01:17:23,007 --> 01:17:25,409
Once her body and soul
are restored,

1009
01:17:25,442 --> 01:17:28,979
your contract with Luc
is null and void.

1010
01:17:29,013 --> 01:17:31,081
Rosalie will never go willingly.

1011
01:17:33,585 --> 01:17:36,153
Spike her drink with this.

1012
01:17:36,187 --> 01:17:39,423
It will put her in a trance long
enough for you to get her in.

1013
01:17:39,456 --> 01:17:41,560
I have something for you.

1014
01:17:43,628 --> 01:17:47,331
Where did you get this?

1015
01:17:47,364 --> 01:17:51,101
This has been missing
from our people for generations,

1016
01:17:51,135 --> 01:17:52,369
centuries.

1017
01:17:52,403 --> 01:17:54,438
Valuable enough to lift
the curse?

1018
01:17:54,471 --> 01:17:56,941
Daniel.
That is not for me to say,

1019
01:17:56,974 --> 01:17:59,443
It is beyond my realm
of knowledge.

1020
01:17:59,476 --> 01:18:01,378
Those curses come from
the spirits,

1021
01:18:01,412 --> 01:18:05,716
but dare I say it couldn't hurt.

1022
01:18:05,749 --> 01:18:09,186
I must give you something
in return of no less value.

1023
01:18:09,220 --> 01:18:10,788
But I have nothing.

1024
01:18:10,821 --> 01:18:12,323
Yes, you do.

1025
01:18:14,825 --> 01:18:16,760
The right half is
Native American land,

1026
01:18:16,794 --> 01:18:18,395
the left half non-Native.

1027
01:18:18,429 --> 01:18:19,730
Crypt is dead center.

1028
01:18:19,763 --> 01:18:21,208
They didn't realize when
they built that

1029
01:18:21,232 --> 01:18:23,267
that half of that
was on sacred ground, too.

1030
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:25,145
Ironically, the one place
in the Christian world

1031
01:18:25,169 --> 01:18:27,204
he can't enter
is the house of the dead.

1032
01:18:27,238 --> 01:18:29,406
The crypt is where
the sacrifice has to...

1033
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:31,275
Say no more.

1034
01:18:35,614 --> 01:18:37,114
Understand this.

1035
01:18:37,147 --> 01:18:38,583
The tunnels that lead
to that crypt

1036
01:18:38,617 --> 01:18:41,553
were used by gangsters
during Prohibition.

1037
01:18:41,586 --> 01:18:43,887
Their souls, among others,
still patrol.

1038
01:18:43,921 --> 01:18:45,489
It won't be easy.

1039
01:18:45,522 --> 01:18:47,100
But the tunnels lead
to the underground entrance.

1040
01:18:47,124 --> 01:18:50,394
If you look here, there's
an above-ground entrance.

1041
01:18:50,427 --> 01:18:51,895
We're not going
through the tunnels.

1042
01:18:51,929 --> 01:18:54,265
We're going in right here.

1043
01:18:54,298 --> 01:18:56,735
I would be shocked
if he allowed access

1044
01:18:56,767 --> 01:18:58,435
to the above-ground entrance.

1045
01:18:58,469 --> 01:19:00,471
But if you must, go in daylight.

1046
01:19:00,504 --> 01:19:04,108
He will move in quickly
if he suspects you have the key.

1047
01:19:04,141 --> 01:19:07,011
Otherwise, head for the tunnels.

1048
01:19:07,044 --> 01:19:10,347
This pipe-shaped one...
It's called a Helix,

1049
01:19:10,381 --> 01:19:12,283
and it will keep the spirits
at bay for a bit,

1050
01:19:12,316 --> 01:19:13,851
but you don't have long.

1051
01:19:13,884 --> 01:19:15,754
Get a hold of it. Oh!

1052
01:19:15,786 --> 01:19:18,522
You mean this?

1053
01:19:18,556 --> 01:19:20,759
Now, you weren't 100% correct
when you said

1054
01:19:20,791 --> 01:19:22,459
that he can't enter
the house of the dead.

1055
01:19:22,493 --> 01:19:25,429
If one of his cronies
gets a hold of...

1056
01:19:25,462 --> 01:19:28,499
the globe... this one...

1057
01:19:28,533 --> 01:19:30,868
He can be summoned.

1058
01:19:30,901 --> 01:19:33,437
I wish I could do more.

1059
01:19:33,470 --> 01:19:35,939
You have done plenty.

1060
01:19:35,973 --> 01:19:38,108
Uh, just out of curiosity,

1061
01:19:38,142 --> 01:19:40,377
what's the story
with the one I gave you?

1062
01:19:44,815 --> 01:19:47,786
The most revered object
of our people.

1063
01:19:47,818 --> 01:19:51,055
Man and nature
working in tandem.

1064
01:19:51,088 --> 01:19:55,059
In a peace offering, it is
the highest sign of respect

1065
01:19:55,092 --> 01:19:58,462
to a former enemy
a revered object.

1066
01:19:58,495 --> 01:20:00,864
You will notice,
in his trickery,

1067
01:20:00,898 --> 01:20:03,467
he gave us a key to a crypt

1068
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:05,336
that he cannot even enter

1069
01:20:05,369 --> 01:20:07,171
and has no use to us.

1070
01:20:07,204 --> 01:20:09,541
We gave him The Eagle
and The Warrior.

1071
01:20:09,574 --> 01:20:11,208
What is its power?

1072
01:20:11,241 --> 01:20:14,311
Nothing.

1073
01:20:14,345 --> 01:20:16,180
And everything.

1074
01:20:21,452 --> 01:20:23,921
The time is now. You must go.

1075
01:20:23,954 --> 01:20:25,923
Go get your daughter back.

1076
01:20:30,194 --> 01:20:32,496
Daniel!
I know we can't afford it.

1077
01:20:32,529 --> 01:20:34,007
Who bailed you out?
- You don't want to know.

1078
01:20:34,031 --> 01:20:36,333
We have to move fast.
Have Rosalie drink that.

1079
01:20:36,367 --> 01:20:37,769
What is this?

1080
01:20:37,802 --> 01:20:39,336
Did... Did that witch
give it to you?

1081
01:20:39,370 --> 01:20:42,439
Yes, the witch,
who is, in fact, our savior.

1082
01:20:42,473 --> 01:20:44,174
Trust me.
- I need a little more

1083
01:20:44,208 --> 01:20:46,210
than blind faith right now.

1084
01:20:48,145 --> 01:20:50,180
Look me in the eye.
I know how to save her.

1085
01:20:50,214 --> 01:20:51,750
But we have to do it now.

1086
01:21:12,637 --> 01:21:15,372
I forgot my ID,
went back to the station.

1087
01:21:15,406 --> 01:21:18,208
That other detective shot
himself, committed suicide.

1088
01:21:18,242 --> 01:21:21,579
And I realized you were
right there, so okay.

1089
01:21:21,613 --> 01:21:23,615
I guess there is another one.

1090
01:21:23,648 --> 01:21:25,048
Wait. What?

1091
01:21:25,082 --> 01:21:26,818
I'm The Harbinger.

1092
01:21:26,851 --> 01:21:28,261
You gotta put yourself
in my position.

1093
01:21:28,285 --> 01:21:30,220
Imagine you're the only
Harbinger,

1094
01:21:30,254 --> 01:21:33,490
and some other schmo
tells you <i>he's</i> The Harbinger.

1095
01:21:33,524 --> 01:21:35,259
But I'm not dropping
these relics, either!

1096
01:21:35,292 --> 01:21:37,896
Oh! Oof.

1097
01:21:37,928 --> 01:21:39,798
The cops were scared, man.

1098
01:21:39,831 --> 01:21:42,933
But, uh, I'll tell you what.

1099
01:21:42,966 --> 01:21:44,935
I believe in Santa Claus now.

1100
01:21:44,968 --> 01:21:47,004
Why would he send
two Harbingers to one town?

1101
01:21:47,037 --> 01:21:50,240
Exactly. Something reeks.

1102
01:21:50,274 --> 01:21:51,810
I want out, too.

1103
01:21:51,843 --> 01:21:54,411
So give me the lowdown.
What's the plan?

1104
01:21:54,445 --> 01:21:55,922
Be sure Rosalie doesn't hear
any of this.

1105
01:21:55,946 --> 01:21:58,015
Have her drink it,
then bring her down.

1106
01:22:01,485 --> 01:22:03,922
The sacrifice.

1107
01:22:03,954 --> 01:22:06,156
The sacrifice?

1108
01:22:06,190 --> 01:22:08,760
That can only be done with
the dagger made by God Himself!

1109
01:22:08,793 --> 01:22:11,930
- I have it.
- You're shittin' me.

1110
01:22:11,962 --> 01:22:14,599
Okay. Okay.
So how do I help?

1111
01:22:14,632 --> 01:22:16,601
You need your Helix
for yourself.

1112
01:22:16,634 --> 01:22:18,035
I never go anywhere without it.

1113
01:22:19,970 --> 01:22:23,173
You expecting someone?

1114
01:22:23,207 --> 01:22:24,943
Shit!

1115
01:22:24,975 --> 01:22:26,052
It can't wait for daylight.

1116
01:22:26,076 --> 01:22:28,145
I have to go now.

1117
01:22:29,513 --> 01:22:31,850
Just let him in, Daniel.

1118
01:22:31,883 --> 01:22:34,017
Just do it his way.

1119
01:22:34,051 --> 01:22:36,621
Baby, I just need you to hold
on a little bit longer for me.

1120
01:22:36,654 --> 01:22:38,288
Okay?

1121
01:22:38,322 --> 01:22:41,960
If it all ends, so be it,
but we gotta try, okay?

1122
01:22:41,992 --> 01:22:43,994
You've always been stronger
than me.

1123
01:22:44,027 --> 01:22:46,631
Will you do it for Rosalie?

1124
01:22:54,539 --> 01:22:56,841
Come on, baby. Come on.

1125
01:23:16,628 --> 01:23:18,428
Stop, stop, stop, stop.
Stop, stop.

1126
01:23:18,462 --> 01:23:20,030
Stop, stop, stop.

1127
01:23:20,063 --> 01:23:21,833
Nice and easy.

1128
01:23:21,866 --> 01:23:24,234
Don't call attention.

1129
01:24:11,649 --> 01:24:13,150
What do we do?

1130
01:24:13,183 --> 01:24:16,253
I thought he couldn't hurt us
on Indian land.

1131
01:24:16,286 --> 01:24:20,592
He doesn't need to.
His presence alone stops us.

1132
01:24:20,625 --> 01:24:22,426
We have to go
through the tunnels.

1133
01:24:22,459 --> 01:24:24,161
Under different
circumstances, I'd say,

1134
01:24:24,194 --> 01:24:26,129
that's... cool.

1135
01:24:26,163 --> 01:24:27,999
The tunnels are on
the Christian side,

1136
01:24:28,032 --> 01:24:29,801
so have your Helix in hand.

1137
01:24:29,834 --> 01:24:33,605
We're not safe until we get
inside and the door is closed.

1138
01:24:33,638 --> 01:24:36,473
Just remember, slow is smooth.

1139
01:24:36,506 --> 01:24:38,676
Smooth is fast.

1140
01:24:38,710 --> 01:24:40,344
Let's move.

1141
01:25:12,577 --> 01:25:14,812
So much for that. Faster.

1142
01:25:33,898 --> 01:25:35,365
This way.

1143
01:25:45,275 --> 01:25:46,911
Honey.

1144
01:25:50,748 --> 01:25:52,583
Come on, baby.

1145
01:25:52,617 --> 01:25:54,619
See you guys on the other side.

1146
01:25:56,954 --> 01:25:58,690
Let's go this, baby. Come on.

1147
01:26:07,565 --> 01:26:10,233
Oh, aah!
There's something in my shoe.

1148
01:26:10,267 --> 01:26:12,537
- Keep moving, honey.
- No. Just a second.

1149
01:26:12,970 --> 01:26:14,605
Aah! Ah!

1150
01:26:14,639 --> 01:26:16,740
Theresa.

1151
01:26:31,988 --> 01:26:34,725
Teresa, can you run?

1152
01:27:05,989 --> 01:27:10,560
Where is she?

1153
01:27:10,594 --> 01:27:12,328
Where is she?

1154
01:27:13,362 --> 01:27:14,965
Where is she?

1155
01:27:14,998 --> 01:27:19,002
<i>Ahhhh. Daniel...</i>

1156
01:27:29,478 --> 01:27:30,914
Go.

1157
01:27:40,023 --> 01:27:41,858
John, keep an eye on the tunnel.

1158
01:27:43,026 --> 01:27:45,294
Teresa, shine your light
on the wall.

1159
01:27:48,632 --> 01:27:52,002
We're in the den of the devil
or on cursed Indian land.

1160
01:27:52,035 --> 01:27:53,637
Either way, we're...

1161
01:27:53,670 --> 01:27:55,172
Look for a keyhole.

1162
01:27:59,876 --> 01:28:02,145
Why did she give me this key?!

1163
01:29:08,778 --> 01:29:10,547
Aah!

1164
01:29:16,753 --> 01:29:18,520
Get in. He can't enter.

1165
01:29:18,555 --> 01:29:20,023
Get in.

1166
01:29:28,665 --> 01:29:30,499
Close!

1167
01:29:39,843 --> 01:29:41,410
Come on, baby.

1168
01:29:59,262 --> 01:30:01,665
I can't go through with it.

1169
01:30:01,698 --> 01:30:03,900
Theresa's right.
It might not work.

1170
01:30:03,934 --> 01:30:07,337
<i>Now</i> you decide that?

1171
01:30:07,370 --> 01:30:09,806
It <i>won't</i> work.

1172
01:30:17,180 --> 01:30:19,316
<i>If his cronies get a hold
of the globe,</i>

1173
01:30:19,349 --> 01:30:20,817
<i>he can be summoned.</i>

1174
01:30:23,219 --> 01:30:24,888
Who are you?

1175
01:30:36,967 --> 01:30:39,169
He's been summoned.

1176
01:30:41,071 --> 01:30:43,273
Okay.

1177
01:30:43,306 --> 01:30:45,709
All right, you win.

1178
01:30:47,344 --> 01:30:49,346
Devil's coming.

1179
01:30:49,379 --> 01:30:51,114
There's not a damn thing
I can do about it.

1180
01:30:51,147 --> 01:30:52,148
You guys win.

1181
01:31:16,406 --> 01:31:18,141
Aaah!

1182
01:31:21,778 --> 01:31:24,647
A a a a a a a a a a ah!

1183
01:31:24,681 --> 01:31:26,349
Ah!

1184
01:31:33,023 --> 01:31:34,224
Daniel, look out!

1185
01:31:36,059 --> 01:31:38,695
A a a a ah!

1186
01:31:40,430 --> 01:31:43,833
Aah! A a a a a ah!

1187
01:32:00,316 --> 01:32:02,585
Aah!

1188
01:32:02,619 --> 01:32:04,587
A a a a a a a ah!

1189
01:32:04,621 --> 01:32:07,057
Aaah!

1190
01:32:28,011 --> 01:32:30,447
Before I kill you, John,
you should know I'm never

1191
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:32,482
gonna stop till these souls
are free.

1192
01:32:32,515 --> 01:32:35,553
Your sweetheart boss can't touch
this town anymore.

1193
01:32:45,462 --> 01:32:48,064
He'll be here any moment.

1194
01:32:48,098 --> 01:32:51,301
Tell him yourself.

1195
01:32:59,342 --> 01:33:01,511
Where's the dagger?

1196
01:33:01,545 --> 01:33:03,213
Where's the dagger?!

1197
01:33:06,182 --> 01:33:07,851
What do I do now?

1198
01:33:07,884 --> 01:33:11,454
It's pointless to worry
about what you can't control.

1199
01:33:11,488 --> 01:33:14,691
It is not safe for him to enter.

1200
01:33:14,724 --> 01:33:18,828
We are forbidden to interfere
with any contract

1201
01:33:18,862 --> 01:33:21,131
someone has with him.

1202
01:33:21,164 --> 01:33:24,033
No talking to, no touching,
no helping Harbingers,

1203
01:33:24,067 --> 01:33:27,337
lest we ourselves
risk damnation.

1204
01:33:27,370 --> 01:33:30,673
I almost gave in to temptation

1205
01:33:30,707 --> 01:33:33,309
when you reached
to open your door to me,

1206
01:33:33,343 --> 01:33:36,513
but thankfully regained
my resolve.

1207
01:33:36,547 --> 01:33:38,848
Now...

1208
01:33:38,882 --> 01:33:41,518
it is too late.

1209
01:33:41,552 --> 01:33:44,053
What are you?

1210
01:33:44,087 --> 01:33:46,022
Emissary.

1211
01:33:46,055 --> 01:33:49,292
Harbinger Protector.

1212
01:33:49,325 --> 01:33:50,927
And Angel.

1213
01:33:52,896 --> 01:33:55,198
Is there a way I can help you?

1214
01:33:55,231 --> 01:33:57,066
No.

1215
01:33:57,100 --> 01:33:59,736
He hit me with the dagger.

1216
01:33:59,769 --> 01:34:01,471
The dagger hit me, too.

1217
01:34:01,504 --> 01:34:03,840
You can live.

1218
01:34:03,873 --> 01:34:06,644
If the dagger pierces
my kind, our earthly form

1219
01:34:06,676 --> 01:34:09,580
in this world is...

1220
01:34:09,613 --> 01:34:11,047
over.

1221
01:34:11,080 --> 01:34:14,717
We need your help.
Are there more of you?

1222
01:34:14,751 --> 01:34:17,588
I was all you had.

1223
01:34:17,621 --> 01:34:20,957
Only so many soldiers
to go around.

1224
01:34:24,562 --> 01:34:29,600
God... be... with...

1225
01:34:56,759 --> 01:34:59,128
Whatever happens, Daniel,

1226
01:34:59,162 --> 01:35:00,797
do not let go of this thing.

1227
01:35:00,830 --> 01:35:03,634
He left it for a reason.

1228
01:35:26,590 --> 01:35:29,259
Mm-hmm.

1229
01:35:39,168 --> 01:35:40,704
Theresa!

1230
01:35:42,606 --> 01:35:44,642
How's the family?

1231
01:35:45,108 --> 01:35:49,846
Oh, Daniel, you perplex me.

1232
01:35:49,879 --> 01:35:52,849
How is it you can be so lost

1233
01:35:52,882 --> 01:35:55,753
in a world of lost souls?

1234
01:35:55,785 --> 01:35:57,820
I would think
you'd fit right in.

1235
01:35:59,355 --> 01:36:01,357
Daniel, I want to show you
something.

1236
01:36:01,391 --> 01:36:03,627
What do you say we pop up
and get a breath of fresh air?

1237
01:36:03,661 --> 01:36:07,130
You can't possibly think
I'm that stupid.

1238
01:36:07,163 --> 01:36:10,933
Well, look at you.

1239
01:36:10,967 --> 01:36:13,369
What I want to show you
can't be seen down here.

1240
01:36:13,403 --> 01:36:14,705
It's a surprise.

1241
01:36:14,738 --> 01:36:16,607
It's educational.

1242
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:18,441
And to be fair,
it's... it's safe.

1243
01:36:18,474 --> 01:36:20,611
Whatever you can show me
up there,

1244
01:36:20,644 --> 01:36:22,312
you can show me right here.

1245
01:36:24,847 --> 01:36:27,050
I was gonna give you
a chance to save your daughter,

1246
01:36:27,083 --> 01:36:28,719
but never mind, you blew it.

1247
01:36:28,752 --> 01:36:31,354
I could have caught you
in the cemetery.

1248
01:36:31,387 --> 01:36:34,658
I could have
killed you in your bed.

1249
01:36:34,692 --> 01:36:36,859
But then we'd be missing out
on all this fun!

1250
01:36:36,893 --> 01:36:38,562
Save it!

1251
01:36:38,595 --> 01:36:40,897
We both know killing me
won't get you what you want.

1252
01:36:40,930 --> 01:36:43,066
So you've been running off

1253
01:36:43,099 --> 01:36:46,402
to see your new girlfriend
on the Indian land.

1254
01:36:46,436 --> 01:36:51,474
Did that old hag make mention
of you being blocked?

1255
01:36:51,507 --> 01:36:54,911
Not being able
to fully read you?

1256
01:36:54,944 --> 01:36:57,213
Well, since she <i>failed,</i>

1257
01:36:57,246 --> 01:36:59,982
let me unblock you.

1258
01:37:09,225 --> 01:37:14,063
I can only erase the memories
of a past life so many times

1259
01:37:14,097 --> 01:37:18,769
before you start losing
the faith earlier in each one,

1260
01:37:18,802 --> 01:37:22,673
sooner and sooner,
to the point where

1261
01:37:22,706 --> 01:37:24,874
you're just a couple
of bad apples.

1262
01:37:24,907 --> 01:37:29,312
You just become worthless.

1263
01:37:31,314 --> 01:37:33,584
In your first lifetime,

1264
01:37:33,617 --> 01:37:39,455
you were dropping relics
like fliessssss

1265
01:37:39,489 --> 01:37:41,391
It made me want
to keep bringing it back.

1266
01:37:41,424 --> 01:37:44,728
You fell off a bit
in your next couple.

1267
01:37:44,762 --> 01:37:46,963
I kept having to bait you with,

1268
01:37:46,996 --> 01:37:50,466
"I'll reverse the Indian curse!"

1269
01:37:50,500 --> 01:37:53,737
You were actually an easy one.

1270
01:37:53,771 --> 01:37:58,941
I'd wager you'd do anything
to remove your curse.

1271
01:37:58,975 --> 01:38:02,813
But your last lifetime,
it was embarrassing.

1272
01:38:02,846 --> 01:38:07,818
And this one...
What kind of a Harbinger

1273
01:38:07,851 --> 01:38:09,986
only drops one relic?

1274
01:38:10,019 --> 01:38:12,656
And you could only bring
yourself to do it that one time

1275
01:38:12,689 --> 01:38:15,258
because he was the one who roped
you into the Ponzi scheme

1276
01:38:15,291 --> 01:38:16,660
in the first place.

1277
01:38:16,693 --> 01:38:20,129
And he used his wife
as a punching bag.

1278
01:38:20,163 --> 01:38:23,567
<i>You</i> are the worst Harbinger
I've ever had.

1279
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:26,235
Sell her the insurance.

1280
01:38:26,269 --> 01:38:27,970
And even when I took
your daughter's soul,

1281
01:38:28,004 --> 01:38:31,240
you couldn't
bring yourself to do it.

1282
01:38:31,274 --> 01:38:34,812
You serve no purpose for me.

1283
01:38:34,845 --> 01:38:37,614
So let me show you
what I've done.

1284
01:39:14,217 --> 01:39:16,553
You see, I knew a long time ago

1285
01:39:16,587 --> 01:39:18,555
that you were
no longer effective.

1286
01:39:18,589 --> 01:39:20,356
But what you didn't count on

1287
01:39:20,389 --> 01:39:23,727
is that this isn't just a town
where Harbingers are sent.

1288
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:26,395
You weren't brought here
to doom anyone.

1289
01:39:26,429 --> 01:39:30,399
This is a town of ex-Harbingers.

1290
01:39:30,433 --> 01:39:33,069
They're already doomed.

1291
01:39:33,102 --> 01:39:34,838
This is a town

1292
01:39:34,872 --> 01:39:40,376
where Harbingers are sent
to be, uh, retired.

1293
01:39:40,409 --> 01:39:41,845
Not getting it?

1294
01:39:41,879 --> 01:39:44,648
Need me to spell it out for you?

1295
01:39:44,681 --> 01:39:48,986
This is one big theater show

1296
01:39:49,018 --> 01:39:51,521
to get you to kill yourselves,

1297
01:39:51,555 --> 01:39:57,093
to harass you enough
to get you... retired.

1298
01:39:57,126 --> 01:40:01,832
And you can't save them either.
They're already dead.

1299
01:40:01,865 --> 01:40:03,567
Like your daughter.

1300
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:07,004
St. Herald son is literally

1301
01:40:07,036 --> 01:40:09,840
Hell on Earth.

1302
01:40:09,873 --> 01:40:12,241
Now do you want
to see what's up there?

1303
01:40:12,275 --> 01:40:13,577
Well, too bad!

1304
01:40:13,610 --> 01:40:15,053
There's only one way
out of this crypt

1305
01:40:15,077 --> 01:40:17,513
for the Snyders now,
and that's down.

1306
01:40:17,548 --> 01:40:19,559
Down! You had your chance.

1307
01:40:19,583 --> 01:40:22,184
You had your chance!
<i>Buenos noches. Arrivederci.</i>

1308
01:40:22,218 --> 01:40:24,120
<i>Adieu! Buenos noches!</i>

1309
01:40:24,153 --> 01:40:26,924
Good night.
Good night!

1310
01:40:35,264 --> 01:40:37,968
Ah. Hmm.

1311
01:40:41,170 --> 01:40:43,239
I see you've had a visitor.

1312
01:40:56,419 --> 01:40:58,354
Aah!

1313
01:41:00,757 --> 01:41:04,226
Aah!

1314
01:41:04,260 --> 01:41:07,631
Ow!

1315
01:41:07,664 --> 01:41:10,232
A a a ah!

1316
01:41:10,266 --> 01:41:13,135
The wrong side of the crypt.

1317
01:41:13,169 --> 01:41:14,805
You can't defeat me.

1318
01:41:22,980 --> 01:41:25,114
A a a a a ah!

1319
01:41:54,844 --> 01:41:57,379
- Ah!
- No!

1320
01:41:57,412 --> 01:41:59,548
Don't hurt him!

1321
01:41:59,582 --> 01:42:02,217
Aah! Aah!

1322
01:42:08,490 --> 01:42:10,525
<i>Do you remember your daughter?</i>

1323
01:42:18,834 --> 01:42:20,736
No!

1324
01:42:36,384 --> 01:42:41,057
Now you've just pissed me off.

1325
01:42:41,090 --> 01:42:43,525
I gave you the chance
to save your daughter

1326
01:42:43,559 --> 01:42:45,061
if you did my bidding.

1327
01:42:45,094 --> 01:42:47,697
You failed me!

1328
01:42:47,730 --> 01:42:51,332
Then you reject
my generous offer tonight.

1329
01:42:51,366 --> 01:42:53,936
You insulted me!

1330
01:42:57,573 --> 01:42:59,441
I revoke my offer.

1331
01:42:59,474 --> 01:43:01,610
I condemn you
to an eternity of servitude,

1332
01:43:01,644 --> 01:43:04,780
and your daughter's soul
is lost forever.

1333
01:43:07,083 --> 01:43:10,385
<i>Sin-bay R'el-bay</i>

1334
01:43:10,418 --> 01:43:14,090
<i>Ei-ou-ah-bum E-Noh</i>

1335
01:43:14,123 --> 01:43:19,562
<i>Kay-shal Fee-loch-Nebeum!</i>

1336
01:43:19,595 --> 01:43:24,700
<i>That's</i> your only option now.

1337
01:43:24,734 --> 01:43:26,869
See you in Hell.

1338
01:43:30,438 --> 01:43:35,544
<i>Only death can save her.
Only death can set her free.</i>

1339
01:43:42,317 --> 01:43:44,319
Me for her.

1340
01:43:44,352 --> 01:43:46,956
Why should I bargain?

1341
01:43:46,989 --> 01:43:49,324
I have your soul already.

1342
01:43:49,357 --> 01:43:53,629
If you win my soul,
you have me forever.

1343
01:43:53,662 --> 01:43:55,296
Ooh.

1344
01:43:57,833 --> 01:43:59,902
Done.

1345
01:43:59,935 --> 01:44:01,469
Daniel!

1346
01:44:03,471 --> 01:44:05,107
I love you, baby.

1347
01:44:07,977 --> 01:44:10,311
Goodbye, my sweet baby girl.

1348
01:44:42,645 --> 01:44:44,780
Ah.

1349
01:45:18,446 --> 01:45:20,082
Mommy?

1350
01:45:21,584 --> 01:45:23,219
Ah.

1351
01:45:24,620 --> 01:45:26,989
Ah! Ah!

1352
01:45:29,725 --> 01:45:31,760
Hi, baby.

1353
01:45:31,794 --> 01:45:36,431
Oh, baby! Oh!

1354
01:45:36,464 --> 01:45:40,202
No, no, no. No, come on.

1355
01:45:43,138 --> 01:45:45,341
No, no.

1356
01:47:05,821 --> 01:47:07,923
I don't know how this happened.

1357
01:47:10,025 --> 01:47:12,194
What?

1358
01:47:12,227 --> 01:47:13,862
What is that?

1359
01:47:16,464 --> 01:47:20,501
If the Card of Death
is present during his curse,

1360
01:47:20,536 --> 01:47:22,538
the souls are restored.

1361
01:47:23,806 --> 01:47:25,473
Where did you get it?

1362
01:47:27,576 --> 01:47:29,211
Him.

1363
01:47:31,479 --> 01:47:33,949
Told me where to find
the dagger, too.

1364
01:48:03,712 --> 01:48:06,248
Good for you.

1365
01:48:06,281 --> 01:48:09,385
I love a challenge.

1366
01:48:09,418 --> 01:48:11,920
Yessssss!

1367
01:48:11,954 --> 01:48:16,959
A a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a ah!

1368
01:48:19,294 --> 01:48:22,931
You and Rosalie have suffered
because of my choices.

1369
01:48:22,965 --> 01:48:24,833
I'm sorry, Theresa.

1370
01:48:24,867 --> 01:48:26,835
Thank you for sticking with me.

1371
01:48:32,307 --> 01:48:35,544
We have the knowledge
and the tools now.

1372
01:48:35,577 --> 01:48:37,746
This town, others out there...

1373
01:48:37,780 --> 01:48:41,116
We could help them, Theresa.

1374
01:48:41,150 --> 01:48:44,153
How many of those Harbinger
Protectors are out there?

1375
01:48:45,654 --> 01:48:47,890
Time to find out.

1376
01:48:56,665 --> 01:49:00,202
<i>In every lifetime,
he has tested me</i>

1377
01:49:00,235 --> 01:49:01,904
<i>and I've failed.</i>

1378
01:49:03,906 --> 01:49:05,941
<i>For whatever reason,</i>

1379
01:49:05,974 --> 01:49:09,945
<i>I've been given a second chance
in this lifetime.</i>

1380
01:49:09,978 --> 01:49:13,949
<i>How many other Rosalies
out there can I save?</i>

1381
01:49:13,982 --> 01:49:17,319
<i>How many others
are forced to be...</i>

1382
01:49:17,352 --> 01:49:19,054
<i>The Harbinger?</i>
