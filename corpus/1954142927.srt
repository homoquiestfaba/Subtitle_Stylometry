1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,499

2
00:00:27,259 --> 00:00:30,579
This film has been rated
"Teen horny."

3
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:35,059
We ask pregnant women
and men already erect

4
00:00:35,339 --> 00:00:37,339
kindly leave the room.

5
00:00:45,619 --> 00:00:47,339
I'm crazy

6
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:51,299
I twisted ideas

7
00:00:52,699 --> 00:00:54,979
There's something wrong

8
00:00:56,419 --> 00:00:58,779
In my head

9
00:01:00,499 --> 00:01:02,979
I'm a pervert, baby

10
00:01:03,819 --> 00:01:06,019
What you will see

11
00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:08,979
can set you free.

12
00:01:09,459 --> 00:01:11,459
But beware!
This is a tale

13
00:01:11,699 --> 00:01:13,419
naked woman

14
00:01:14,139 --> 00:01:16,619
unbridled male desires,

15
00:01:17,539 --> 00:01:21,019
witchcraft bloody

16
00:01:21,619 --> 00:01:23,779
and sex!

17
00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:15,299
Dead

18
00:02:22,499 --> 00:02:24,099
Freedom

19
00:02:51,059 --> 00:02:54,579
I arrived in town
late last night

20
00:02:54,859 --> 00:02:56,819
Not a single girl in sight

21
00:02:57,379 --> 00:02:59,779
All day, I wanted to race

22
00:03:00,059 --> 00:03:02,139
But I did flee
all the beauties

23
00:03:04,499 --> 00:03:07,019
They threw me, thrown, thrown

24
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:12,419
Hello. Brocktonville you go to?

25
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:15,019
I do not know. I'm not here.

26
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:17,179
I go to Desert Range.

27
00:03:17,539 --> 00:03:19,459
- This is my way.
- Super.

28
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:27,779
- Take that, little viper!
- Leave me alone!

29
00:03:28,859 --> 00:03:29,779
Get off me!

30
00:03:32,019 --> 00:03:33,659
Watch out for your ass.

31
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:37,859
I'll keep an eye on,
you can be sure.

32
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:43,859
Look good,
because I'm out.

33
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:47,939
- Let me go.
- You got a nice ass,

34
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:51,618
but it will not prevent you
receiving a good spanking!

35
00:04:02,338 --> 00:04:04,418
I tasted a lot of melons
in my life,

36
00:04:04,658 --> 00:04:08,498
and damaged fruit
never deterred me.

37
00:04:14,018 --> 00:04:14,978
Can I?

38
00:04:15,258 --> 00:04:16,458
I beg you.

39
00:04:16,778 --> 00:04:19,578
You matches
in the glove box?

40
00:04:21,498 --> 00:04:22,218
Do not open it!

41
00:04:22,778 --> 00:04:24,578
But it is disgusting!

42
00:04:24,938 --> 00:04:26,698
- I'm sorry.
- You're a pervert?

43
00:04:27,098 --> 00:04:29,578
No!
But the journey was long and ...

44
00:04:29,858 --> 00:04:32,018
Kind of sick!
Stop this car.

45
00:04:33,378 --> 00:04:36,658
It must change!
He told me it would change!

46
00:04:37,178 --> 00:04:40,538
Farm, wanker!
Rather fall on a serial killer!

47
00:05:04,578 --> 00:05:07,098
Not surprising
that you like overripe fruit.

48
00:05:07,378 --> 00:05:09,738
You're as rotten as them.

49
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:10,938
That's enough.

50
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:14,818
Listen to me:
my son came to see me.

51
00:05:15,218 --> 00:05:18,338
It should not doubt
what is happening here.

52
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:20,738
Your son, I do not care.

53
00:05:21,018 --> 00:05:23,898
- If it takes you, it's a nase.
- Here it is.

54
00:05:28,778 --> 00:05:30,218
Active now.

55
00:05:30,498 --> 00:05:35,298
If you talk, I will show you
what I'm capable of.

56
00:05:35,578 --> 00:05:38,538
You know what, Hezekiah?
You got that out of the mouth,

57
00:05:38,778 --> 00:05:40,258
you're just ...

58
00:05:40,538 --> 00:05:42,698
Deflated your tire.

59
00:05:43,498 --> 00:05:46,218
Should have it checked.

60
00:05:47,098 --> 00:05:49,018
It's good to see you, Dad.

61
00:05:49,338 --> 00:05:53,138
It seems to me that the last time
that is crossed, it was ...

62
00:05:54,178 --> 00:05:55,498
A mom's funeral.

63
00:05:57,218 --> 00:06:02,338
And the time when it was seen
before a porn cinema.

64
00:06:04,258 --> 00:06:05,418
An annoying hair.

65
00:06:05,978 --> 00:06:09,458
That is true.
But all this is behind us.

66
00:06:09,698 --> 00:06:12,218
I'm in college.
I turned the page.

67
00:06:12,658 --> 00:06:14,218
Congratulations, son.

68
00:06:15,818 --> 00:06:19,858
Since you stay here all summer,
you will not be unemployed.

69
00:06:20,098 --> 00:06:21,898
Tomorrow
I put you to work.

70
00:06:22,938 --> 00:06:25,178
I'll show you your room.

71
00:06:25,698 --> 00:06:28,778
There is a good bodybuilder in town?

72
00:06:29,018 --> 00:06:31,418
Speaking of body ...

73
00:06:32,178 --> 00:06:33,738
My eyes have flourished.

74
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:36,858
There had to be a miracle,
this night.

75
00:06:37,098 --> 00:06:38,418
They took good 15 cm.

76
00:06:39,898 --> 00:06:41,338
You must be James.

77
00:06:41,578 --> 00:06:42,938
James, here is Cheryl.

78
00:06:44,378 --> 00:06:47,178
It does not replace your mother,

79
00:06:47,418 --> 00:06:51,018
but it fills me
very differently.

80
00:06:52,618 --> 00:06:55,618
I hope that my presence
will not bother you.

81
00:06:56,698 --> 00:06:58,978
We will spend a great summer.

82
00:07:09,778 --> 00:07:11,498
College, it is the foot.

83
00:07:11,738 --> 00:07:17,378
I had to get used to the campus
and life in a new city,

84
00:07:17,618 --> 00:07:19,538
but New Orleans is top.

85
00:07:19,778 --> 00:07:20,978
Cultural life,

86
00:07:21,698 --> 00:07:23,698
music

87
00:07:23,938 --> 00:07:25,258
gastronomy ...

88
00:07:25,858 --> 00:07:29,618
I can not wait to return. This year,
I will not be blue.

89
00:07:30,538 --> 00:07:32,458
What do you study?

90
00:07:33,178 --> 00:07:36,978
Next semester,
I'll ecology,

91
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:39,098
chemistry,

92
00:07:41,058 --> 00:07:43,697
study of the evolution
human health,

93
00:07:44,217 --> 00:07:46,537
Religious Studies A sia,

94
00:07:46,777 --> 00:07:48,137
story ...

95
00:07:51,377 --> 00:07:55,217
Hydropower and ...

96
00:07:56,497 --> 00:07:57,377
the Navy.

97
00:07:59,577 --> 00:08:00,977
And also Hebrew lessons ...

98
00:08:04,897 --> 00:08:07,017
And I'll volunteer

99
00:08:07,297 --> 00:08:09,777
in a center
for troubled youth.

100
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:11,417
It's a beautiful package.

101
00:08:14,817 --> 00:08:18,217
I thought
a friend accompany you.

102
00:08:18,497 --> 00:08:20,257
How's it going,
with chicks?

103
00:08:20,937 --> 00:08:24,337
I've never had much luck
with the girls, but ...

104
00:08:25,537 --> 00:08:27,937
I think it will change.

105
00:08:32,537 --> 00:08:33,617
I'm sorry!

106
00:08:34,577 --> 00:08:36,097
It does not matter.

107
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:40,057
Stronger, Hezekiah, stronger!

108
00:08:46,097 --> 00:08:47,137
Fuck me!

109
00:08:47,577 --> 00:08:49,257
- What's my name?
- Hezekiah.

110
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:55,617
- My date of birth?
- June 8, 1924.

111
00:08:56,777 --> 00:08:58,337
The capital of Maryland?

112
00:08:59,377 --> 00:09:01,457
Baltimore, Hon!

113
00:10:11,857 --> 00:10:14,217
You must be thirsty. Want.

114
00:10:14,497 --> 00:10:15,297
Thank you.

115
00:10:17,337 --> 00:10:19,337
You've worked hard
since this morning.

116
00:10:19,617 --> 00:10:22,617
Take a break, come lunch.

117
00:10:22,857 --> 00:10:24,537
There is too much to do.

118
00:10:24,777 --> 00:10:28,897
We barely started closing.
We'll eat later.

119
00:10:29,177 --> 00:10:32,897
I do not say no
for something to munch on.

120
00:10:33,177 --> 00:10:35,577
- James, I told you ...
- Come on, Hezekiah!

121
00:10:35,857 --> 00:10:38,017
Do not overwork,

122
00:10:38,257 --> 00:10:40,777
otherwise it will be good for nothing.

123
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,977
Well, okay.

124
00:10:43,217 --> 00:10:44,857
But hurry.

125
00:10:45,097 --> 00:10:47,097
You know what they say:

126
00:10:47,377 --> 00:10:49,377
a loaf is better than two ...

127
00:10:51,537 --> 00:10:53,897
Men
can not be feminists

128
00:10:54,177 --> 00:10:56,057
because of societal norms.

129
00:10:59,057 --> 00:11:00,697
Look at that!

130
00:11:00,977 --> 00:11:03,297
Your father loves canned.

131
00:11:03,697 --> 00:11:06,937
It would a platypus
canned if he found one.

132
00:11:08,297 --> 00:11:11,577
There platypus
in New Orleans, James?

133
00:11:11,817 --> 00:11:14,017
No. I think
that there is in Australia.

134
00:11:14,897 --> 00:11:16,977
Give me your hand.

135
00:11:18,417 --> 00:11:19,817
Obey.

136
00:11:25,537 --> 00:11:27,017
Here, like this.

137
00:11:27,617 --> 00:11:29,217
Smoothly.

138
00:11:34,216 --> 00:11:37,456
Well, well ... a cherry.

139
00:11:48,736 --> 00:11:52,216
There is a little slut
will be delighted.

140
00:11:53,216 --> 00:11:55,336
A taste you now.

141
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:59,256
You bread?
Because eating with your fingers ...

142
00:12:00,056 --> 00:12:01,136
No.

143
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:03,496
Lesson number 2.

144
00:12:05,856 --> 00:12:07,056
Tire language.

145
00:12:08,056 --> 00:12:10,936
Come on, what! Shows it to me.

146
00:12:12,576 --> 00:12:14,216
Go ahead and eat.

147
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:25,496
Come on. I prepared a picnic.

148
00:12:36,096 --> 00:12:38,416
It's been
my father and you ...

149
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:42,656
We live together? Few months.

150
00:12:43,736 --> 00:12:45,136
You like it?

151
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:48,736
You're really a baby.

152
00:12:51,216 --> 00:12:52,696
It's just that ...

153
00:12:53,536 --> 00:12:56,856
I'm getting
feelings for you.

154
00:12:57,096 --> 00:12:58,856
I know it's wrong.

155
00:12:59,096 --> 00:13:03,416
You underpants bubbling,
that's what you feel.

156
00:13:03,696 --> 00:13:05,016
Watch out.

157
00:13:07,096 --> 00:13:08,336
Viewing.

158
00:13:08,816 --> 00:13:10,816
A honeycomb.

159
00:13:14,016 --> 00:13:16,496
Attention.
Do not approach.

160
00:13:17,336 --> 00:13:20,096
Leave the nest. This is dangerous.

161
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:21,616
Put it down.

162
00:13:22,696 --> 00:13:25,336
Jam,
it was just an appetizer.

163
00:13:25,936 --> 00:13:27,376
That's the main course.

164
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:11,336
A table, darling.

165
00:14:29,776 --> 00:14:31,416
Good for you!

166
00:14:31,696 --> 00:14:34,376
That's what happens when you touch
the nest of others.

167
00:14:35,576 --> 00:14:37,096
His head like a balloon.

168
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,096
Shut up, woman!

169
00:14:39,376 --> 00:14:41,656
It's your fault that he is there.

170
00:14:42,576 --> 00:14:44,976
It makes us lose
a half-day's work,

171
00:14:45,216 --> 00:14:47,016
the time the swelling.

172
00:14:47,256 --> 00:14:49,336
I could not guess
he was allergic.

173
00:14:49,576 --> 00:14:53,496
It's not his fault, Dad.
I'll be more careful.

174
00:14:53,736 --> 00:14:55,096
You better.

175
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:59,336
Be thankful you do not
falling on a rattlesnake.

176
00:15:00,056 --> 00:15:02,536
Next time,
you will not get out alive.

177
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:55,415
What I want
start today

178
00:15:55,695 --> 00:15:58,415
is the construction
the south end of the ranch.

179
00:15:59,695 --> 00:16:01,695
Then we build a corral.

180
00:16:02,535 --> 00:16:04,935
You have not lied, we will toil.

181
00:16:05,175 --> 00:16:08,135
In fact, dad,
I think we have rats.

182
00:16:08,415 --> 00:16:10,175
I heard in my room.

183
00:16:10,455 --> 00:16:12,335
The little bastards!

184
00:16:12,575 --> 00:16:14,735
Far
the house was spared.

185
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,735
They should come to my studio.

186
00:16:17,695 --> 00:16:19,015
I set traps.

187
00:16:19,855 --> 00:16:21,175
Your studio?

188
00:16:21,415 --> 00:16:23,615
The place where I work.

189
00:16:23,855 --> 00:16:25,655
Come, I'll show you.

190
00:16:32,095 --> 00:16:33,975
Chlingue it!

191
00:16:38,055 --> 00:16:39,295
What is it?

192
00:16:39,575 --> 00:16:41,575
- A slaughterhouse?
- Quite the opposite!

193
00:16:41,855 --> 00:16:44,055
Here, I give life to things.

194
00:16:49,055 --> 00:16:51,695
Women laid bare.

195
00:16:52,695 --> 00:16:54,815
Since when are you an artist?

196
00:16:55,095 --> 00:16:58,495
After the death of your mother,
the insurance money

197
00:16:58,735 --> 00:17:00,975
helped me realize
the dream of my life.

198
00:17:01,215 --> 00:17:02,375
It is a real eye?

199
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:05,415
Initially, I worked
with beef jerky.

200
00:17:05,655 --> 00:17:09,575
It does not rot
and it is very malleable.

201
00:17:10,255 --> 00:17:15,935
But what we gain in flexibility
variety is lost,

202
00:17:16,215 --> 00:17:17,695
in style, texture.

203
00:17:18,855 --> 00:17:20,735
Anyone know what you do?

204
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:22,975
They know.

205
00:17:23,935 --> 00:17:26,615
The so-called critical
wrote about my art

206
00:17:26,855 --> 00:17:30,055
pen dipped in their bile.

207
00:17:30,615 --> 00:17:31,655
Do you realize,

208
00:17:32,255 --> 00:17:35,775
one of them had the nerve
calling me crazy!

209
00:17:41,095 --> 00:17:43,055
This sculpture,

210
00:17:43,335 --> 00:17:44,575
this masterpiece,

211
00:17:45,175 --> 00:17:47,535
I'll dedicate.

212
00:17:53,735 --> 00:17:55,335
I called

213
00:17:56,495 --> 00:17:58,215
Ophelia.

214
00:18:29,015 --> 00:18:30,095
Once finished the corral,

215
00:18:31,615 --> 00:18:32,735
I'll livestock.

216
00:18:33,895 --> 00:18:36,735
I have no further expenditure
from the food.

217
00:18:40,215 --> 00:18:43,375
You think I could
eligible for a grant?

218
00:18:47,215 --> 00:18:49,095
I do not know what they teach you,

219
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:51,335
but when two men argue,

220
00:18:51,575 --> 00:18:54,335
they look straight in the eye.

221
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:58,295
We did not teach me
to be a man.

222
00:18:58,575 --> 00:19:00,695
It was not
program this semester.

223
00:19:00,935 --> 00:19:02,255
It should have.

224
00:19:02,495 --> 00:19:03,815
You'd have needed it.

225
00:19:04,055 --> 00:19:06,295
The kids
learn it at home.

226
00:19:06,535 --> 00:19:08,895
When they had a father.

227
00:19:09,175 --> 00:19:12,294
- Strip parasites unemployed!
- And you? You never worked.

228
00:19:12,534 --> 00:19:14,334
You're just exhausted mom.

229
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,294
Leave your mother out!

230
00:19:17,854 --> 00:19:20,774
If she could see you,
she would die ... again!

231
00:19:21,614 --> 00:19:23,654
Well, let's talk.

232
00:19:23,934 --> 00:19:25,894
She died how, exactly?

233
00:19:30,614 --> 00:19:33,014
Drops. I go to the garage.

234
00:19:34,694 --> 00:19:35,894
Do not come late.

235
00:19:36,414 --> 00:19:38,894
This road is not safe at night.

236
00:19:58,414 --> 00:20:00,014
It gauze?

237
00:20:01,574 --> 00:20:02,454
Yes, and you?

238
00:20:02,974 --> 00:20:05,334
Top relax.

239
00:20:06,334 --> 00:20:08,454
If you could look at my car.

240
00:20:08,694 --> 00:20:11,294
It may need
new tires.

241
00:20:11,534 --> 00:20:12,934
Beautiful case.

242
00:20:13,214 --> 00:20:16,254
- I polishes?
- Excuse me?

243
00:20:16,534 --> 00:20:17,854
Your cash.

244
00:20:18,094 --> 00:20:21,414
The covers are in need
of some polish.

245
00:20:21,774 --> 00:20:22,934
You have understood what?

246
00:20:25,094 --> 00:20:29,894
You might take a look
and encrypt my work?

247
00:20:30,174 --> 00:20:33,454
No ... Today,
I have no time.

248
00:20:38,054 --> 00:20:41,534
You have no other car.
If I come back in an hour ...

249
00:20:46,214 --> 00:20:48,694
Bother me
when I have a customer!

250
00:20:51,494 --> 00:20:52,974
Back to work!

251
00:21:00,054 --> 00:21:01,814
So, like I said,

252
00:21:02,134 --> 00:21:05,534
I can not put me,
I have to leave one day.

253
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:07,694
Looking for a place to sleep?

254
00:21:09,494 --> 00:21:11,774
And full, it is done?

255
00:21:12,254 --> 00:21:15,534
- You're not here, you.
- No. I came to see my father.

256
00:21:16,454 --> 00:21:19,294
Are you the son of Hezekiah?
You sleep at the ranch?

257
00:21:19,934 --> 00:21:21,454
Yes, my father.

258
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:24,494
It is a well crazy bastard!

259
00:21:24,774 --> 00:21:28,134
And super slut well croupée
who lives with him!

260
00:21:29,774 --> 00:21:31,534
There is nothing like a little ...

261
00:21:31,774 --> 00:21:32,974
weird?

262
00:21:34,414 --> 00:21:35,654
No ...

263
00:21:36,014 --> 00:21:39,774
Those who stay too long
Desert Range

264
00:21:40,054 --> 00:21:41,334
have a nickname.

265
00:21:42,094 --> 00:21:45,254
- What nickname?
- "Disturbed."

266
00:21:45,574 --> 00:21:48,054
He thing there in the desert.

267
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:52,054
People become zarbis here.

268
00:21:54,174 --> 00:21:55,854
Give me your keys.

269
00:22:23,094 --> 00:22:24,454
Fresh meat.

270
00:22:45,414 --> 00:22:47,134
I place you, sweetie?

271
00:22:47,734 --> 00:22:49,054
Played well.

272
00:22:49,374 --> 00:22:50,694
You passed by that?

273
00:22:51,414 --> 00:22:53,214
I was at home manicure.

274
00:22:53,574 --> 00:22:54,374
Among nudists?

275
00:22:55,214 --> 00:22:57,454
- Monte.
- Move over.

276
00:23:11,173 --> 00:23:13,253
Looks like you've seen a ghost.

277
00:23:13,493 --> 00:23:15,693
I almost serve dinner
a rattlesnake.

278
00:23:16,613 --> 00:23:19,373
Snakes eat not
men. It's too big.

279
00:23:25,413 --> 00:23:26,653
You know something about snakes.

280
00:23:26,933 --> 00:23:28,853
Normal, I grew up in Texas.

281
00:23:29,173 --> 00:23:31,773
- This is where you met daddy?
- No. A Reno.

282
00:23:32,013 --> 00:23:34,893
I worked as a dancer
and dragged him into the corner.

283
00:23:36,013 --> 00:23:37,493
You're a stripper?

284
00:23:37,773 --> 00:23:40,053
Do not take your airs.

285
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:42,693
We do what we can to survive.

286
00:23:42,933 --> 00:23:46,013
When you've grown
in a caravan camp,

287
00:23:46,253 --> 00:23:47,573
you have one desire: to shoot you.

288
00:23:48,053 --> 00:23:52,933
I'm not here to fall
in a family melodrama.

289
00:23:53,213 --> 00:23:55,213
I came
learn to be a man.

290
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:57,213
At your service.

291
00:23:58,173 --> 00:23:59,853
What are you doing?

292
00:24:01,813 --> 00:24:03,253
I see nothing!

293
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:09,733
Good God!

294
00:24:16,253 --> 00:24:18,173
But what is she doing?

295
00:24:23,613 --> 00:24:25,333
Slow ...

296
00:24:36,573 --> 00:24:39,653
Damn, Cheryl!
You want to kill me or what?

297
00:24:39,893 --> 00:24:42,493
If women
were made for driving

298
00:24:42,733 --> 00:24:45,773
they have a brain
and no breasts!

299
00:24:49,573 --> 00:24:50,933
At home.

300
00:24:52,733 --> 00:24:54,533
What you did not care here?

301
00:24:55,253 --> 00:24:57,613
You hunted squirrels
for your statues?

302
00:24:57,893 --> 00:24:58,573
Coyotes.

303
00:24:59,853 --> 00:25:02,893
The Indians called
illusionists.

304
00:25:03,413 --> 00:25:04,933
As if scandalized,

305
00:25:05,173 --> 00:25:07,573
disgusted, amused, disturbed,

306
00:25:07,853 --> 00:25:09,853
chastised and humiliated

307
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:12,573
these prehistoric beasts beings.

308
00:25:14,213 --> 00:25:17,493
For me, these pooches
feignasses are scabby.

309
00:25:17,773 --> 00:25:20,253
I not give to eat
a chink.

310
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,533
Here it is! Stand still.

311
00:25:28,533 --> 00:25:30,093
Vire me that gun!

312
00:25:30,853 --> 00:25:33,133
We had scaring.

313
00:25:33,373 --> 00:25:35,453
Whatever. It will not go away.

314
00:25:43,853 --> 00:25:46,733
Yet have I thought traps.

315
00:27:31,172 --> 00:27:32,052
Sacrilege!

316
00:27:33,492 --> 00:27:35,052
How dare you make me a cuckold?

317
00:27:35,332 --> 00:27:37,572
You, my own son!

318
00:27:38,052 --> 00:27:40,772
The wrath of the Lord
come upon your souls!

319
00:27:41,052 --> 00:27:44,372
It pasteurisera your blood,
dissolve your kidney

320
00:27:44,612 --> 00:27:47,492
distil your intestines
to empty

321
00:27:47,732 --> 00:27:50,412
any foul matter!

322
00:27:51,532 --> 00:27:53,692
He be my witness!

323
00:27:59,852 --> 00:28:01,572
Do not answer me!

324
00:28:05,092 --> 00:28:07,212
I do not want to hear you!

325
00:28:07,812 --> 00:28:10,092
You're a senile old!

326
00:28:13,012 --> 00:28:15,132
You do not can get for you like that.

327
00:28:24,612 --> 00:28:26,332
I know what I saw!

328
00:28:26,612 --> 00:28:28,892
You can not do this to me.

329
00:28:35,932 --> 00:28:37,332
Go back to bed, you son.

330
00:28:37,732 --> 00:28:40,012
You've already done enough of that.

331
00:29:13,532 --> 00:29:14,532
Hello, Dad.

332
00:29:16,492 --> 00:29:20,372
- What are you doing?
- I'm working on a sculpture.

333
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:22,812
I finally dropped the damn coyote.

334
00:29:26,612 --> 00:29:29,772
Sorry
for what happened with Cheryl.

335
00:29:30,772 --> 00:29:33,772
I do not seek
find me an apology, but ...

336
00:29:34,412 --> 00:29:36,132
I could not control myself.

337
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:38,772
It's hard to explain.

338
00:29:39,492 --> 00:29:41,532
It's not your fault, James.

339
00:29:41,932 --> 00:29:43,892
It is the devil who has worked.

340
00:29:44,172 --> 00:29:47,292
- Where is she?
- Cheryl? She is gone.

341
00:29:48,052 --> 00:29:51,092
She packed up that night.

342
00:29:53,092 --> 00:29:56,252
Do not worry.
It will never return.

343
00:30:12,332 --> 00:30:15,412
On my return,
I want the fence has advanced.

344
00:30:15,652 --> 00:30:18,092
- On the Job
- OK, Dad.

345
00:31:38,211 --> 00:31:40,451
Who's this fag?
The butler?

346
00:31:40,931 --> 00:31:42,571
This is my son, James.

347
00:31:42,851 --> 00:31:44,771
It helps me on the ranch.

348
00:31:46,091 --> 00:31:49,451
This is correct?
It is where your apron?

349
00:31:50,731 --> 00:31:51,571
Alicia!

350
00:31:51,891 --> 00:31:52,891
Not you angry.

351
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:55,771
He did not look good beefy.

352
00:31:56,611 --> 00:31:57,891
I want, thank you.

353
00:31:58,571 --> 00:32:02,811
I imagine.
Nobody is going to hold you.

354
00:32:29,091 --> 00:32:31,851
- Testicles. 1.5 kg.
- OK.

355
00:32:36,011 --> 00:32:38,771
Liver. 8 kg.

356
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:43,051
Chicken drumsticks.
What is it you?

357
00:32:43,411 --> 00:32:45,171
This is for the match on Sunday.

358
00:32:45,411 --> 00:32:48,411
They had to deliver the cheese, too.

359
00:32:52,691 --> 00:32:54,371
Lamb. 5 kg.

360
00:32:55,331 --> 00:32:57,171
There are how many packets?

361
00:33:03,491 --> 00:33:05,531
- 24.
- Damn wood!

362
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:09,771
This is the last time
they deliver me like that.

363
00:33:10,051 --> 00:33:15,331
I like sheep
such as women, plump.

364
00:33:18,411 --> 00:33:21,651
I need to buy cattle.

365
00:33:21,931 --> 00:33:23,251
A bit of everything.

366
00:33:23,611 --> 00:33:27,131
And I can tell you that
I lésinerai not on merchandise.

367
00:33:38,371 --> 00:33:40,691
I carry it all in your workshop?

368
00:33:40,931 --> 00:33:43,531
No, I got it.

369
00:33:43,731 --> 00:33:45,531
So make a break.

370
00:33:46,371 --> 00:33:48,251
Are you serious?

371
00:33:48,531 --> 00:33:51,131
You have worked hard. You deserve it.

372
00:33:51,371 --> 00:33:54,691
Find yourself a corner in the shade
and relax.

373
00:33:55,731 --> 00:33:59,131
But do not put your feet
in my workshop.

374
00:33:59,571 --> 00:34:03,891
I am preparing a new exhibition.
This is a surprise.

375
00:34:04,211 --> 00:34:06,531
So do not just bother me.

376
00:34:30,931 --> 00:34:33,170
You have a beautiful ass!

377
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:39,970
You know what I like.

378
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:54,450
Down from the saddle,
I need sleep.

379
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:51,010
Hi, you. What is it?

380
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:52,290
You scared me.

381
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:56,850
Looking the money your father?
It does not give you enough?

382
00:35:57,090 --> 00:36:00,810
I just came to get the key.
Go back to sleep.

383
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:02,210
I can not.

384
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:04,930
I'm too restless.

385
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:07,370
It opens what, this key?

386
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:10,210
Say it to me.
This will be our little secret.

387
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:15,370
Lie down again.

388
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:19,730
Come on, James. I'm like an egg.

389
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:22,970
Dure outside,

390
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:26,730
but if you touch me in the right place

391
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:32,010
I pour all over you.

392
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:35,970
Okay.

393
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:37,290
Listen:

394
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:39,970
meet me in the kitchen

395
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:41,530
in 5 minutes.

396
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:45,530
And we will make a lovely omelette.

397
00:38:35,209 --> 00:38:36,689
Is that you, James?

398
00:38:53,929 --> 00:38:55,169
Cheryl?

399
00:39:03,009 --> 00:39:04,969
You're at the bottom, James.

400
00:39:10,609 --> 00:39:11,569
It hurts!

401
00:39:20,249 --> 00:39:21,729
Who did this to you?

402
00:39:22,009 --> 00:39:23,529
Cheryl, listen to me!

403
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:26,209
Say something!

404
00:39:33,889 --> 00:39:35,489
Why, son? Why?

405
00:39:36,009 --> 00:39:39,369
I would ask you
exactly the same question.

406
00:39:40,889 --> 00:39:43,169
It was a delightful being.

407
00:39:43,889 --> 00:39:45,289
A good soul.

408
00:39:45,569 --> 00:39:49,449
There's another in your workshop
covered in blood.

409
00:39:49,729 --> 00:39:51,009
Can you explain me?

410
00:39:51,249 --> 00:39:54,129
Cheryl?
Get rid of the bodies.

411
00:39:54,689 --> 00:39:56,129
Are you kidding me?

412
00:39:56,369 --> 00:39:59,449
- You have to call the police!
- No, not the police!

413
00:39:59,729 --> 00:40:01,529
It is useless.

414
00:40:01,809 --> 00:40:03,849
We will not get away.

415
00:40:04,129 --> 00:40:08,049
These girls had family.
Someone will look.

416
00:40:08,329 --> 00:40:11,569
You do not understand.
These girls were whores.

417
00:40:12,009 --> 00:40:15,209
Two big fucking no friends.

418
00:40:15,489 --> 00:40:17,929
They will not miss anyone.

419
00:40:19,089 --> 00:40:21,369
You paid them to have sex with you?

420
00:40:21,849 --> 00:40:23,009
It's like that.

421
00:40:24,169 --> 00:40:26,489
They provided me services

422
00:40:26,769 --> 00:40:29,329
in exchange for compensation.

423
00:40:29,609 --> 00:40:31,009
A big compensation.

424
00:40:32,249 --> 00:40:36,609
Money Mom served
to indulge your vices.

425
00:40:40,849 --> 00:40:44,569
Will take shovels in the workshop.
Hurry.

426
00:40:46,889 --> 00:40:48,649
I want to avoid jail you.

427
00:40:49,409 --> 00:40:52,369
We solve this problem by family.

428
00:40:52,609 --> 00:40:54,729
I promise we will come out.

429
00:40:55,489 --> 00:40:58,049
I will not go to prison.
I have done nothing.

430
00:40:58,249 --> 00:41:00,649
- Me neither.
- Why are you lying?

431
00:41:00,889 --> 00:41:03,689
I tell the truth.
It is you who lie!

432
00:41:04,049 --> 00:41:06,169
I have the impression that you think.

433
00:41:06,449 --> 00:41:09,489
What freak is quite senile
to kill two women

434
00:41:09,729 --> 00:41:10,969
and then forget?

435
00:41:11,249 --> 00:41:13,729
As calibrated, like son, it seems.

436
00:41:14,409 --> 00:41:16,569
Let us bury them.

437
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:17,889
Without a coffin?

438
00:41:18,169 --> 00:41:19,889
Should although to puff.

439
00:41:20,249 --> 00:41:21,489
Wait.

440
00:41:21,769 --> 00:41:24,129
Just last respects.

441
00:41:34,209 --> 00:41:35,729
Dad, you got something there.

442
00:41:36,929 --> 00:41:38,049
Where?

443
00:41:41,569 --> 00:41:44,689
I have clearer ideas
with a beautiful girl

444
00:41:44,929 --> 00:41:45,969
at my side.

445
00:41:47,609 --> 00:41:50,809
- I'll go into town.
- Certainly not.

446
00:41:51,049 --> 00:41:53,889
This is how
our troubles began.

447
00:41:54,169 --> 00:41:55,729
No more hookers for you.

448
00:41:56,009 --> 00:41:58,729
I gotta get back to the garage.

449
00:41:59,009 --> 00:42:01,849
Above all, keep quiet.

450
00:42:20,008 --> 00:42:22,248
- Hello?
- The retirement home?

451
00:42:23,768 --> 00:42:26,888
I have to admit my father
on the spot.

452
00:42:27,408 --> 00:42:29,808
It is completely sick.

453
00:42:31,248 --> 00:42:33,768
Dad! Leave the phone.

454
00:42:34,488 --> 00:42:35,768
Hangs up.

455
00:42:38,248 --> 00:42:40,408
I can bring?

456
00:42:42,248 --> 00:42:44,128
No, health side, all is well.

457
00:42:44,408 --> 00:42:47,648
But I think it kills
young prostitutes.

458
00:42:48,848 --> 00:42:50,008
Dad!

459
00:42:50,408 --> 00:42:54,208
I'm still online. Hangs up!

460
00:42:58,488 --> 00:43:00,168
- Take appointment.
- No, I'm leaving.

461
00:43:00,408 --> 00:43:02,688
- When?
- Today.

462
00:43:02,968 --> 00:43:05,768
- I send someone to evaluate it.
- The estimate?

463
00:43:06,008 --> 00:43:07,568
Tell me everything.

464
00:43:18,768 --> 00:43:22,448
You just need to change the tires!
I must go myself.

465
00:43:27,008 --> 00:43:29,568
You will not go far
From what I've found

466
00:43:29,848 --> 00:43:31,888
under your hood.

467
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:35,728
You counted back in town?

468
00:43:36,008 --> 00:43:38,808
Far from here.
You were right about this place.

469
00:43:39,888 --> 00:43:41,968
You see what I mean?

470
00:43:43,048 --> 00:43:45,648
This is a real failure or not?

471
00:43:45,888 --> 00:43:50,848
If it's just a scheming
say it, get it over.

472
00:43:51,168 --> 00:43:53,568
Relax and watch.

473
00:43:54,328 --> 00:43:56,688
The problem is
the feed pump.

474
00:43:56,928 --> 00:44:00,888
It is secured to the engine

475
00:44:01,168 --> 00:44:03,528
pump ... and gasoline.

476
00:44:04,488 --> 00:44:06,088
But not here.

477
00:44:07,448 --> 00:44:09,808
If I can repair the injection,

478
00:44:10,888 --> 00:44:13,288
gasoline burn better,

479
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:16,848
without emissions.

480
00:44:17,848 --> 00:44:19,488
You understand?

481
00:44:20,008 --> 00:44:21,728
Here, key.

482
00:44:22,408 --> 00:44:27,368
I believe you.
It ready tomorrow.

483
00:44:29,408 --> 00:44:33,168
I've never seen
small cute ass too.

484
00:44:58,088 --> 00:44:59,168
Pretty box.

485
00:45:00,008 --> 00:45:01,328
The frame goes with?

486
00:45:01,608 --> 00:45:04,448
Or it is a luxury option?

487
00:45:05,528 --> 00:45:07,008
The frame is sold separately.

488
00:45:07,288 --> 00:45:09,408
The new models are better.

489
00:45:09,768 --> 00:45:11,088
The car is new.

490
00:45:11,368 --> 00:45:15,128
But no carbide
this kind of crap.

491
00:45:15,448 --> 00:45:16,808
What do you want me?

492
00:45:17,088 --> 00:45:18,648
I am your nurse.

493
00:45:20,528 --> 00:45:21,688
What's going on?

494
00:45:22,008 --> 00:45:24,768
Patricia Veros,
care center.

495
00:45:25,008 --> 00:45:28,248
I demanded they send a man.

496
00:45:29,248 --> 00:45:31,208
I look like a man?

497
00:45:32,408 --> 00:45:34,408
I do not need a nurse.

498
00:45:34,688 --> 00:45:38,328
I'm in great shape.
Fresh as a roach.

499
00:45:38,568 --> 00:45:41,088
This is just a test.

500
00:45:42,248 --> 00:45:44,328
- You want to feel the goods?
- Dad!

501
00:45:45,848 --> 00:45:47,728
It does not take long.

502
00:45:48,008 --> 00:45:50,048
Do not hurry.

503
00:45:50,728 --> 00:45:53,688
No need to screw up the thing.

504
00:46:02,487 --> 00:46:05,967
- You're in shape.
- I like bread.

505
00:46:06,247 --> 00:46:08,647
Over time, I cured.

506
00:46:10,287 --> 00:46:12,287
Perverse!

507
00:46:13,807 --> 00:46:18,167
The Lord gave me hands
for they are activated.

508
00:46:18,407 --> 00:46:19,847
I obey His will.

509
00:46:20,327 --> 00:46:21,807
If God had wanted ...

510
00:46:23,847 --> 00:46:25,647
While you are under this roof,

511
00:46:25,927 --> 00:46:27,527
I forbid you to blaspheme.

512
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:31,727
Shut up and impale yourself on me.

513
00:46:32,167 --> 00:46:33,567
Hide me this stuff!

514
00:46:38,887 --> 00:46:41,807
So what did you do
these girls?

515
00:46:42,047 --> 00:46:46,367
Why should I have killed?
Still, they served to me.

516
00:46:46,607 --> 00:46:51,447
- All men have their hobby.
- Should choose bowling.

517
00:46:52,047 --> 00:46:52,887
Hold.

518
00:46:54,367 --> 00:46:57,487
Your filthy mind
end up in the gutter.

519
00:46:57,727 --> 00:46:58,967
Oral examination.

520
00:47:01,087 --> 00:47:04,127
- Go ahead, chat!
- I do not babes.

521
00:47:10,807 --> 00:47:12,647
A little taste?

522
00:47:15,047 --> 00:47:18,327
This is better than your tuft,
kind of bitch.

523
00:47:19,327 --> 00:47:20,247
OK.

524
00:47:21,767 --> 00:47:23,407
Two fried eggs, two!

525
00:47:30,767 --> 00:47:33,807
Miss! I talk to you?

526
00:47:35,207 --> 00:47:37,367
You were forced to burn?

527
00:47:38,367 --> 00:47:40,847
It is not known
if he is really guilty.

528
00:47:41,087 --> 00:47:42,767
Your father tried to rape me.

529
00:47:43,047 --> 00:47:44,967
Better keep an eye on.

530
00:47:45,207 --> 00:47:49,047
If nothing happens
in the coming days,

531
00:47:49,327 --> 00:47:51,087
it will be fixed.

532
00:47:54,607 --> 00:47:56,607
In the meantime, what do we do?

533
00:48:31,607 --> 00:48:34,367
You always had
trouble with girls?

534
00:48:36,327 --> 00:48:39,047
I meet,
but I can not ...

535
00:48:39,327 --> 00:48:40,967
Sleep with them?

536
00:48:41,367 --> 00:48:44,047
To begin a real relationship.

537
00:48:45,367 --> 00:48:47,207
Sunset would be a good start.

538
00:48:47,487 --> 00:48:51,847
I find it hard to believe.
You're so easygoing.

539
00:48:53,167 --> 00:48:59,447
It stuck me a dirty label
that has followed me all my schooling.

540
00:48:59,727 --> 00:49:04,407
It often happens
when a child is ahead.

541
00:49:05,967 --> 00:49:09,087
I was a compulsive masturbator.

542
00:49:09,367 --> 00:49:13,007
In high school,
I was called Super Wanker.

543
00:49:14,167 --> 00:49:15,487
It's cute.

544
00:49:17,167 --> 00:49:18,527
Hello image perverse.

545
00:49:18,767 --> 00:49:21,327
I do not remember what it is,
a pervert.

546
00:49:21,607 --> 00:49:24,447
Some hide this side
better than others.

547
00:49:24,687 --> 00:49:27,447
Me for example, I am a lesbian.

548
00:49:33,327 --> 00:49:37,047
I'm a little disappointed.
I thought you and me ...

549
00:49:37,327 --> 00:49:39,407
Homosexuality is a choice.

550
00:49:39,687 --> 00:49:43,727
Gays can tack
as they want, according to their desire.

551
00:49:44,487 --> 00:49:47,247
I plan to go straight.

552
00:49:47,527 --> 00:49:51,727
What I mean,
is that you can change its nature.

553
00:49:52,006 --> 00:49:53,526
I did quite a few times.

554
00:49:55,926 --> 00:49:59,606
- Let's talk all night?
- Talk?

555
00:50:01,166 --> 00:50:03,526
You're adorable, James.

556
00:50:03,766 --> 00:50:07,086
Where,
the gun is on the rack.

557
00:50:07,366 --> 00:50:10,166
In case what?
Your father is attached.

558
00:50:11,286 --> 00:50:15,166
If it is not the killer,
it means that the other still lurking.

559
00:50:15,526 --> 00:50:16,526
The other?

560
00:50:17,006 --> 00:50:19,286
A man ... or something.

561
00:50:20,606 --> 00:50:21,926
Whatever.

562
00:50:22,166 --> 00:50:24,406
What are we talking about?

563
00:50:25,686 --> 00:50:28,566
Let's talk about what we love.
I begin.

564
00:50:28,926 --> 00:50:30,966
- Your favorite color?
- Red.

565
00:50:31,246 --> 00:50:34,366
Me is blue.
Your favorite sport?

566
00:50:34,606 --> 00:50:36,646
- Basketball.
- The baseball.

567
00:50:36,886 --> 00:50:40,606
If you had to destroy an entire people,
what would it be?

568
00:50:42,566 --> 00:50:44,646
Asians. No, Filipinos.

569
00:51:21,846 --> 00:51:23,446
I got you, damn!

570
00:52:15,006 --> 00:52:16,086
Good morning.

571
00:52:18,246 --> 00:52:20,366
We fell asleep last night.

572
00:52:21,406 --> 00:52:22,606
It wrong?

573
00:52:23,006 --> 00:52:25,926
You missed a nice fight.

574
00:52:26,406 --> 00:52:29,286
We made rascality?
I was not drunk at this point.

575
00:52:29,526 --> 00:52:33,126
That's not it. I made
attacked by something.

576
00:52:33,566 --> 00:52:36,326
- An animal?
- Maybe.

577
00:52:38,206 --> 00:52:39,886
It was like what?

578
00:52:40,166 --> 00:52:42,806
I have not been able to see it.

579
00:52:43,086 --> 00:52:45,766
It was long like that.

580
00:52:52,526 --> 00:52:54,726
Good morning.
How you feel?

581
00:52:55,006 --> 00:52:57,086
As in a Greek tragedy.

582
00:52:57,526 --> 00:53:01,766
As an incompetent king
held by his traitorous son.

583
00:53:03,926 --> 00:53:06,926
Sorry
being forced to hold you.

584
00:53:07,366 --> 00:53:08,526
It's almost finished.

585
00:53:08,766 --> 00:53:10,766
I heard gunshots.

586
00:53:11,046 --> 00:53:13,046
What was the problem?

587
00:53:13,326 --> 00:53:17,566
Patty shot something.
One thing that came into the house.

588
00:53:17,846 --> 00:53:19,286
Maybe a coyote.

589
00:53:21,246 --> 00:53:23,406
The Illusionist. Be careful, son.

590
00:53:25,166 --> 00:53:27,886
It can capture your heart

591
00:53:28,166 --> 00:53:30,326
but pray to God
he does not have your soul.

592
00:53:46,885 --> 00:53:48,845
I did not know you were there.

593
00:53:49,085 --> 00:53:52,005
- We have a big problem.
- Which one?

594
00:53:52,365 --> 00:53:53,925
Must release my father.

595
00:53:54,205 --> 00:53:57,165
It's not him
who killed those girls.

596
00:53:57,405 --> 00:54:00,205
Okay. We detach later.

597
00:54:00,685 --> 00:54:02,725
I must tell you something.

598
00:54:02,965 --> 00:54:04,805
So do I.

599
00:54:05,285 --> 00:54:08,405
You know I never
loved men:

600
00:54:08,645 --> 00:54:11,605
too many muscles
and not enough curves.

601
00:54:12,445 --> 00:54:17,165
But you make me feel the effect.
I can not resist.

602
00:54:21,085 --> 00:54:22,165
I love you.

603
00:54:23,525 --> 00:54:26,925
That's your problem?
There is really nothing.

604
00:54:27,165 --> 00:54:28,885
Me too, I love you.

605
00:54:29,245 --> 00:54:30,285
Is that true?

606
00:54:35,525 --> 00:54:37,085
Patty, wait!

607
00:54:46,485 --> 00:54:47,525
Who's there?

608
00:54:57,405 --> 00:54:59,485
I know you're there.

609
00:55:00,485 --> 00:55:02,485
Show yourself, demon!

610
00:55:05,325 --> 00:55:06,765
Wait!

611
00:55:07,005 --> 00:55:09,925
Calm down. I can explain everything.

612
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:15,085
I told you that I had seen a doctor
in New Orleans.

613
00:55:15,365 --> 00:55:16,685
It was not a real doctor.

614
00:55:16,925 --> 00:55:18,605
It does not bother me.

615
00:55:18,845 --> 00:55:20,565
It was a sorcerer.

616
00:55:21,685 --> 00:55:23,205
It was black magic.

617
00:55:23,485 --> 00:55:25,765
Voodoo is common practice

618
00:55:26,005 --> 00:55:29,685
since the 18th century, when slaves
found themselves in Beauregard Square.

619
00:55:29,925 --> 00:55:33,485
Anyway, I went to see this type
and it gave me a lot.

620
00:55:33,725 --> 00:55:36,965
He told me that women
find me irresistible

621
00:55:38,525 --> 00:55:40,005
everybody

622
00:55:40,245 --> 00:55:43,885
would want to fuck with me,
without me having to do anything.

623
00:55:44,205 --> 00:55:47,245
Finished the galleys,
appointments troublesome

624
00:55:47,525 --> 00:55:49,005
the loose evenings

625
00:55:49,245 --> 00:55:51,605
to masturbate

626
00:55:51,885 --> 00:55:55,885
in plastic
with engine oil.

627
00:55:57,045 --> 00:56:00,245
But it was necessary compensation.

628
00:56:01,845 --> 00:56:04,645
All women
who succumb to my charm

629
00:56:04,925 --> 00:56:06,845
are victims
my male attributes.

630
00:56:08,125 --> 00:56:10,605
It is only now
I understand.

631
00:56:11,525 --> 00:56:12,525
Look at me.

632
00:56:13,205 --> 00:56:14,725
Look at me!

633
00:56:21,165 --> 00:56:26,245
And it will appear on Earth
as a phallus.

634
00:56:34,925 --> 00:56:37,085
Be a mischievous,

635
00:56:38,005 --> 00:56:38,965
stiff shaft

636
00:56:40,845 --> 00:56:43,125
dissension ungodly.

637
00:56:43,725 --> 00:56:46,205
Go back where you came from, Succubus!

638
00:56:47,205 --> 00:56:49,205
In the infamous depths
hell!

639
00:56:56,565 --> 00:56:59,165
I knew that my penis
would detach

640
00:56:59,365 --> 00:57:00,685
and become an assassin.

641
00:57:00,925 --> 00:57:02,165
I swear.

642
00:57:02,685 --> 00:57:04,725
I can probably
sue.

643
00:57:05,125 --> 00:57:06,045
Well ...

644
00:57:08,045 --> 00:57:09,525
You hurt?

645
00:57:12,805 --> 00:57:15,685
Your head tells me something.

646
00:57:18,525 --> 00:57:20,765
Your curves, your shape ...

647
00:57:24,485 --> 00:57:25,565
I know you?

648
00:57:27,605 --> 00:57:31,685
It almost seems
you are the fruit of my flesh.

649
00:57:34,484 --> 00:57:36,564
Come, my poor child.

650
00:57:36,924 --> 00:57:39,004
Free me from these links.

651
00:57:40,204 --> 00:57:43,324
Opens these treacherous handcuffs.

652
00:57:44,164 --> 00:57:46,084
Give me back my freedom.

653
00:57:46,604 --> 00:57:47,804
Go!

654
00:57:52,924 --> 00:57:54,884
I spent a wonderful evening.

655
00:57:55,564 --> 00:57:57,604
I want to finish
with this curse.

656
00:57:57,884 --> 00:58:00,324
I will do what it takes to.

657
00:58:01,484 --> 00:58:04,484
So listen:
you, you're dressed.

658
00:58:04,764 --> 00:58:06,484
Then we attack this thing.

659
00:58:06,764 --> 00:58:09,324
Like this
it will do more damage.

660
00:58:13,284 --> 00:58:16,364
What you said still stands?

661
00:58:16,604 --> 00:58:17,764
On your doctor? Yes.

662
00:58:18,004 --> 00:58:19,164
No!

663
00:58:19,404 --> 00:58:20,884
You said you loved me.

664
00:58:21,684 --> 00:58:23,684
It was a killer cornered cock.

665
00:58:23,924 --> 00:58:25,644
Then we'll talk, OK?

666
00:58:58,524 --> 00:59:02,044
Right length, but too skinny.

667
01:01:00,484 --> 01:01:02,004
Hi, buddy.

668
01:01:02,244 --> 01:01:04,364
I did not mean to surprise you.

669
01:01:04,604 --> 01:01:07,044
- What are you doing here?
- I brought your car.

670
01:01:07,484 --> 01:01:09,164
You fall ill.

671
01:01:09,444 --> 01:01:13,204
I typed my way so far
and you will not let me go?

672
01:01:13,484 --> 01:01:15,204
You do not get the picture.

673
01:01:15,484 --> 01:01:18,804
This is the shit here.
Should you dégagiez.

674
01:01:20,484 --> 01:01:23,763
You pay my bill and I break.

675
01:01:24,603 --> 01:01:27,043
- I can not pay it.
- This is not good.

676
01:01:27,523 --> 01:01:28,283
This is bastard.

677
01:01:28,523 --> 01:01:33,403
Go home
I will come and pay you tomorrow.

678
01:01:33,683 --> 01:01:35,843
No, not you dig.

679
01:01:36,083 --> 01:01:37,483
I came,

680
01:01:37,723 --> 01:01:42,363
so if you have not sorrel,
I will have to pay otherwise.

681
01:01:43,243 --> 01:01:45,323
How does it otherwise?

682
01:01:46,243 --> 01:01:47,523
Let me think.

683
01:01:50,363 --> 01:01:53,683
I do not stop thinking about you!

684
01:01:55,043 --> 01:01:56,363
Let me go!

685
01:01:57,603 --> 01:02:00,483
Take my car
and break you!

686
01:02:00,763 --> 01:02:02,523
Do not worry, I'll let you go.

687
01:02:02,763 --> 01:02:04,763
Once I have all discharged!

688
01:02:05,003 --> 01:02:07,523
I'm not a fag on TV

689
01:02:07,803 --> 01:02:10,083
just to repaint your stay.

690
01:02:10,363 --> 01:02:13,203
I came smash your ass!

691
01:02:18,323 --> 01:02:19,563
I'm suffocating.

692
01:02:20,083 --> 01:02:21,243
My dick!

693
01:02:25,243 --> 01:02:26,003
I'm suffocating!

694
01:02:32,323 --> 01:02:33,603
Kind of sick!

695
01:03:02,763 --> 01:03:04,563
Oh yes, it's good!

696
01:03:09,923 --> 01:03:10,803
Fuck me.

697
01:03:11,443 --> 01:03:13,083
Go on, all the way!

698
01:03:19,083 --> 01:03:20,683
Fuck me, my dog.

699
01:03:32,323 --> 01:03:33,563
What are you doing?

700
01:03:34,483 --> 01:03:35,443
This is too deep!

701
01:04:03,883 --> 01:04:05,523
I hate you!

702
01:04:09,163 --> 01:04:11,243
You made me suffer all my life!

703
01:04:11,483 --> 01:04:15,523
Now I know:
it is you, the pervert!

704
01:04:24,603 --> 01:04:26,363
Do not cry.

705
01:04:26,763 --> 01:04:29,483
You know
we will not leave.

706
01:04:38,563 --> 01:04:40,643
Loose the tail, son.

707
01:04:40,883 --> 01:04:43,483
She tries to bamboozle you.

708
01:04:44,163 --> 01:04:46,003
- "She"?
- Yes.

709
01:04:46,563 --> 01:04:48,723
This cock is a girl.

710
01:04:49,043 --> 01:04:50,723
Right, sweetie?

711
01:04:51,403 --> 01:04:53,763
A penis is male.

712
01:04:54,043 --> 01:04:56,083
Revises your biology class.

713
01:04:56,363 --> 01:04:58,643
Each type has two sexes.

714
01:04:58,883 --> 01:05:01,163
This tail
sweat the X chromosome:

715
01:05:01,403 --> 01:05:03,683
she is jealous,
venomous vain.

716
01:05:04,123 --> 01:05:05,643
This is your problem:

717
01:05:05,923 --> 01:05:10,563
not a girl you would recognize
to the way you masturbate.

718
01:05:11,203 --> 01:05:13,282
Because
you know women, you?

719
01:05:13,682 --> 01:05:15,722
With your dirty little whores

720
01:05:16,002 --> 01:05:18,322
your sculptures and abject?

721
01:05:18,602 --> 01:05:20,002
And what you did to Mom!

722
01:05:20,242 --> 01:05:21,762
What are you accusing me?

723
01:05:22,842 --> 01:05:24,282
Go ahead, spit your venom.

724
01:05:24,522 --> 01:05:27,202
It itches since you got here.

725
01:05:27,482 --> 01:05:29,562
Say, if you got the balls!

726
01:05:34,162 --> 01:05:35,362
Do not move.

727
01:05:38,562 --> 01:05:39,642
Mollo, the nurse.

728
01:05:39,882 --> 01:05:41,442
I'm not a nurse.

729
01:05:41,722 --> 01:05:45,042
I never put
feet to a doctor.

730
01:05:45,322 --> 01:05:46,162
Who are you?

731
01:05:47,082 --> 01:05:48,442
Species sick!

732
01:05:48,722 --> 01:05:52,082
This disgusting thing killed
the only person I loved.

733
01:05:52,362 --> 01:05:53,882
I'm crazy about you, James.

734
01:05:54,482 --> 01:05:56,842
Cheryl was that I loved.

735
01:06:26,842 --> 01:06:30,922
It was to be married
spring in San Francisco.

736
01:06:31,162 --> 01:06:33,362
She took a job as a dancer.

737
01:06:33,602 --> 01:06:34,802
And she met him.

738
01:06:35,042 --> 01:06:36,882
She wanted to pluck.

739
01:06:37,162 --> 01:06:39,482
It was supposed to be a great plane.

740
01:06:39,722 --> 01:06:41,602
You've noticed anything.

741
01:06:41,882 --> 01:06:43,202
Now you will pay.

742
01:06:43,482 --> 01:06:45,042
I should have known

743
01:06:45,322 --> 01:06:47,162
that you were a lesbian.

744
01:06:47,882 --> 01:06:51,722
My dear, you're going to get into the bone.

745
01:06:52,402 --> 01:06:53,442
Kill her.

746
01:06:53,922 --> 01:06:55,122
Go to hell!

747
01:07:03,962 --> 01:07:05,162
Dad, okay?

748
01:07:05,842 --> 01:07:08,322
Do not your sissy.

749
01:07:08,562 --> 01:07:10,522
This is a scratch.

750
01:07:16,042 --> 01:07:18,722
I should have been a better father.

751
01:07:19,162 --> 01:07:21,802
You know, I did not kill your mother.

752
01:07:22,682 --> 01:07:26,162
The plane crashed
and there were survivors.

753
01:07:26,522 --> 01:07:28,682
But your mother is mad.

754
01:07:28,922 --> 01:07:31,882
She killed the survivors one by one
to eat.

755
01:07:32,162 --> 01:07:35,482
I could not stop.
It forced me to look at.

756
01:07:37,042 --> 01:07:38,842
I was next.

757
01:07:39,402 --> 01:07:42,562
But devouring his last victim,

758
01:07:42,842 --> 01:07:44,522
she choked.

759
01:07:46,242 --> 01:07:48,162
It saved my life.

760
01:07:48,402 --> 01:07:49,962
Talk about a life!

761
01:07:50,362 --> 01:07:52,962
Haunted by nightmares,

762
01:07:53,202 --> 01:07:55,282
I turned to art,

763
01:07:55,562 --> 01:07:57,842
seeking comfort
among prostitutes.

764
01:07:58,202 --> 01:08:00,242
Papa, forgive me.

765
01:08:01,082 --> 01:08:02,442
I should believe you.

766
01:08:02,722 --> 01:08:04,082
When you came,

767
01:08:04,522 --> 01:08:06,762
I've changed.

768
01:08:07,522 --> 01:08:11,242
I realized how
my life was empty without you.

769
01:08:12,842 --> 01:08:15,842
I accused you
not to be a man.

770
01:08:16,122 --> 01:08:18,882
However, it was me
that I needed to grow.

771
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:21,242
I love you, James.

772
01:08:22,682 --> 01:08:23,682
So do I.

773
01:08:24,762 --> 01:08:28,722
I mean:
I'm in love with you.

774
01:08:30,322 --> 01:08:33,082
Kiss your old father,
I beg you.

775
01:08:33,362 --> 01:08:35,402
A kiss for an old man

776
01:08:35,682 --> 01:08:37,242
before dying.

777
01:08:47,042 --> 01:08:49,442
Give it to Ophelia.

778
01:08:52,522 --> 01:08:54,882
It will be a good breast.

779
01:09:00,522 --> 01:09:02,441
As calibrated, like son.

780
01:09:21,601 --> 01:09:22,601
Then you ...

781
01:10:05,441 --> 01:10:08,441
Who wants a cocktail sausage?

782
01:10:22,321 --> 01:10:25,081
When you arrive late
a barbecue,

783
01:10:25,321 --> 01:10:30,001
it remains
as sausages cramées.

784
01:10:33,761 --> 01:10:36,401
Good fireworks, Bastard!

785
01:10:50,201 --> 01:10:52,241
Bitch! You killed Patty!

786
01:11:19,241 --> 01:11:21,761
Six months later

787
01:11:36,361 --> 01:11:37,681
James, I love you!

788
01:11:38,201 --> 01:11:39,801
Be less kids!

789
01:11:41,161 --> 01:11:42,361
The party starts.

790
01:11:42,601 --> 01:11:44,121
Here we go.

791
01:11:46,881 --> 01:11:49,441
- What idiots!
- Forget it.

792
01:11:58,041 --> 01:11:58,921
I gotta go.

793
01:11:59,601 --> 01:12:02,881
It's party
and the guys are counting on me.

794
01:12:06,001 --> 01:12:09,081
A bit, James.

795
01:12:13,121 --> 01:12:15,041
I chair the festival committee.

796
01:12:15,321 --> 01:12:16,641
I need help.

797
01:12:16,921 --> 01:12:18,081
And me?

798
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:20,401
I'm ready.

799
01:12:21,081 --> 01:12:24,321
I can not wait.

800
01:12:26,241 --> 01:12:27,961
Take me, James.

801
01:12:28,761 --> 01:12:31,641
Frankly, I'd love to, but ...

802
01:12:31,921 --> 01:12:33,201
you forget my curse.

803
01:12:33,561 --> 01:12:35,441
We have already spoken.

804
01:12:35,881 --> 01:12:37,201
It's been six months.

805
01:12:37,481 --> 01:12:40,801
We went out
whole semester without problem.

806
01:12:41,361 --> 01:12:43,041
It's over, all that.

807
01:12:43,321 --> 01:12:45,401
You broke the curse.

808
01:12:50,001 --> 01:12:50,961
Open the glove box.

809
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:53,160
What?

810
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:55,160
Opens, I tell you.

811
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:58,960
- This is not a joke?
- Not at all.

812
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:00,640
Trust me.

813
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:12,240
James! Is
that means ...?

814
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:15,400
I intended to offer you
after the party tonight.

815
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,520
But I'm ready.

816
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:22,680
Ready to start a new life.

817
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:24,120
With you.

818
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:27,520
- I love you.
- Me too.

819
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:32,400
Can I open it?

820
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:34,400
Course.

821
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:36,840
I hope it will you.

822
01:13:56,680 --> 01:13:58,600
Thus, the monster lives ...

823
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:01,520
He breathes, he feels,

824
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:03,000
it kills,

825
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:06,480
but do not worry
the truth.

826
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:07,920
Looking good:

827
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:11,240
deep in your heart
the key is hidden

828
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:14,080
which will free you from sin.

829
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:17,240
For love, true love,

830
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:21,080
will always be the winner.

831
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:55,320
End
