7
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:39,424
Oh. Hi.

8
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,562
I don't know what to do.

9
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:46,999
I don't even have friends
who have kids.

10
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:50,335
I'm not a kid.

11
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:54,873
I want to treat you
like the adult

12
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,276
that your father wanted you
to grow into

13
00:02:57,278 --> 00:03:01,246
and that your mother wished
she could see.

14
00:03:05,486 --> 00:03:08,787
Why can't you look me
in the face?

15
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,959
You were twins.

16
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:20,098
Looking at you
is like looking at a ghost.

17
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,234
Do you remember her?

18
00:03:22,236 --> 00:03:25,771
Well, I was five
when she died.

19
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:36,081
It's been a rough week.

20
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,750
Let's just be friends.
For now.

21
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,560
Drink it.

22
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:52,197
Um, I'm not a milk drinker,
per se.

23
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:54,466
Beer?

24
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:57,069
Mm, no, I'm driving.

25
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:58,704
To silver falls?

26
00:03:58,706 --> 00:04:02,541
Why would I want
to go to haunted silver falls?

27
00:04:02,543 --> 00:04:04,309
Burning mannequin.

28
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:06,645
Oh, that.

29
00:04:06,647 --> 00:04:11,783
Yeah, I'm not tuned in
to the cool kids like you are.

30
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:19,925
Jordan's not ready
for the falls.

31
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,796
That's why we're going
to the movies.

32
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:27,432
Drink it.

33
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:28,567
It's hard to funnel beer

34
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:32,738
when your gut's full of 2%.

35
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:47,486
How'd she do?

36
00:04:47,488 --> 00:04:50,589
At school her first week.

37
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:51,990
I don't know about her,

38
00:04:51,992 --> 00:04:56,395
but it's been the best week
of my life.

39
00:04:56,397 --> 00:04:58,664
She just lost her father,
Larry.

40
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:02,267
She plays like she's okay,

41
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:06,038
but you're smart enough to know
she's not, right?

42
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,875
Yeah, she... she's safe.

43
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:15,714
Let's go.

44
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:17,616
Lates.

45
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:26,758
Good night, Larry.

46
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,794
I like that kid.

47
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:43,742
Hey, guys. Hey.
Thank you, thank you.

48
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:48,880
Hey, Larry, check this out.

49
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:51,483
It kicks in mild
and wraps around your brain

50
00:05:51,485 --> 00:05:53,018
like a warm blanket.

51
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,986
It's fast Albert.

52
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:56,822
I'd buy two, 'cause,
when I did it, I took one,

53
00:05:56,824 --> 00:05:58,490
I took another one
a half hour later.

54
00:05:58,492 --> 00:06:01,560
And you won't need to drink.

55
00:06:01,562 --> 00:06:04,096
Two?
Do you really need that many?

56
00:06:04,098 --> 00:06:05,764
Come on, Larry.

57
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:07,999
You know I don't sell anything
I haven't tried myself.

58
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:10,769
Actually, I don't.

59
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:14,339
But how much?
- $100 for four.

60
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:17,976
Trust me. You'll want a friend
to be in your worid.

61
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:20,379
Seriously?

62
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:22,214
That price is a rip-off.

63
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:24,549
And that surprises you?

64
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,752
Where do you think you are,

65
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,467
There you go.

66
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:45,670
Enjoy.

67
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:09,995
- Come on.
- I'm trying.

68
00:07:09,997 --> 00:07:12,164
'Kay.

69
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,417
I'm not taking those.

70
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:34,920
Why not?

71
00:07:34,922 --> 00:07:37,155
Well, it's just not my style.

72
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:38,824
But you're from L.A.

73
00:07:38,826 --> 00:07:43,628
Yeah, but that's not
who I am.

74
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,198
- Please?
If we don't do this,

75
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,866
you're gonna be bored
out of your mind,

76
00:07:47,868 --> 00:07:51,670
and you're never gonna go out
with me again.

77
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:55,440
I like this.

78
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:57,509
Really?

79
00:07:57,511 --> 00:07:59,744
- Yeah.
I mean, I've never been

80
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:01,446
in the woods before.

81
00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:05,984
Griffith park, but that's,
like, more dogs than trees.

82
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:11,690
Why the mannequin?

83
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:14,493
- Oh.
Scares the ghosts.

84
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:16,194
Ghosts?

85
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:18,597
Yeah, there's a lot
of dead people in silver falls.

86
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:20,565
Didn't anyone tell you?

87
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:23,101
It's ghost city, usa.

88
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:25,470
Right.

89
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:28,373
So who died?

90
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,509
Who didn't die?

91
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:32,677
I've been to six funerals.

92
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,580
There were several suicides,

93
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:37,816
a car accident,

94
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:40,185
a bulimic
whose stomach exploded...

95
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:44,956
A drowning and leukemia.

96
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:51,096
Mom and dad?

97
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,000
You wanna talk about it?

98
00:08:55,002 --> 00:08:57,669
Tell me more
about the ghosts.

99
00:08:59,006 --> 00:09:01,806
Um...
Well, they're nice.

100
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:04,042
They only kill you once.

101
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:07,345
- I could die once.
- Yeah, they like to stop by

102
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:09,147
and watch you sleep.

103
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:10,949
My favorite.

104
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:14,386
And they like to whisper
to you.

105
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:18,323
"Jordan. Jordan."

106
00:09:18,325 --> 00:09:23,428
They like to open doors
that have been closed.

107
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,363
Turn on appliances.

108
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:28,500
Well, it's how they talk.

109
00:09:28,502 --> 00:09:32,103
Well, I don't speak haunted.

110
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:34,439
But I'm pretty sure
they like candy.

111
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:36,908
The Reese's, the milk duds.

112
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:41,613
Wrappers all over the floor.

113
00:09:45,652 --> 00:09:48,753
Come on.
Let's go.

114
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:39,704
Jordan.

115
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:42,240
Larry?

116
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:55,353
Larry?

117
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:04,062
Larry?

118
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:19,811
Jordan.

119
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:47,238
Jordan.
Shh.

120
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,107
Cops got your boy.

121
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:51,876
I'll take you home.

122
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:32,517
Do me a favor and tell them
my name is Jane.

123
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:35,120
Jane Smith.
- Why?

124
00:12:35,122 --> 00:12:37,355
You got a record?
- Can you be cool?

125
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:40,325
Or do I need to tell you
how to do this?

126
00:12:40,327 --> 00:12:43,828
If we get out of this,
you owe me one.

127
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:48,066
Oh.

128
00:12:48,068 --> 00:12:52,070
Oh, no, it only counts
if we kiss.

129
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:58,777
Damn it.
He's coming up on my side.

130
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:05,583
Your left tail light
is out, Robbie.

131
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:08,019
Again?
I just had it fixed.

132
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:09,854
Must have a short.

133
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:12,023
I told you
not to take the pickup.

134
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:14,859
Dad, I'm a little...

135
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:17,262
little low on gas.

136
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:25,970
You take her home.

137
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:29,541
<i>Her home.</i>

138
00:13:29,543 --> 00:13:32,544
Yes, dad.

139
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:40,752
Dad?

140
00:13:40,754 --> 00:13:42,954
Ugh.

141
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:57,502
You know, he's not gonna be
able to keep up with you.

142
00:13:57,504 --> 00:14:00,071
Excuse me?

143
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:02,340
Look, I've known Larry
a long time.

144
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,309
He's cool.

145
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:05,643
Good guy.

146
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:07,712
Obviously not your type.

147
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:09,447
Like you?

148
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:12,684
Nah, you couldn't even keep up
with me.

149
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:15,286
But I could go slower.

150
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:17,822
If asked nicely.

151
00:14:17,824 --> 00:14:19,224
And with less clothes.

152
00:14:19,226 --> 00:14:22,794
Oh, so, you mean
if I asked with this?

153
00:14:22,796 --> 00:14:24,796
Depends what you do with it.

154
00:14:24,798 --> 00:14:27,432
Ugh.

155
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:44,749
Well, thanks for the ride.

156
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:47,652
No, it hasn't begun yet.

157
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:49,087
It's about to.

158
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:51,556
Does that really work
for you?

159
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:54,158
I don't have to work
for anything.

160
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,429
Well, you'll be working
for yourself tonight.

161
00:16:57,549 --> 00:17:01,085
Night, dad.

162
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:04,555
And mom.

163
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:23,327
Do you want me
to put these somewhere else?

164
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:30,034
I like them the way
they were.

165
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:33,704
Then why did you do this?

166
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:37,875
I didn't.

167
00:19:37,877 --> 00:19:40,344
Maybe it was the wind.

168
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:43,581
House is drafty.

169
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:54,325
Here we go.

170
00:19:54,327 --> 00:19:56,961
I hope you're hungry.

171
00:19:56,963 --> 00:20:01,032
I like cereal.

172
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:03,000
Like, low-tech.

173
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:05,770
Cheerios, life, pops.

174
00:20:05,772 --> 00:20:07,538
She likes cereal.

175
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,373
She likes cereal.

176
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,009
We'll get some today.

177
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:19,483
So how come my dad
never visited?

178
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:25,823
And why haven't you guys
ever come to L.A.?

179
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:31,162
Like you said,
I look just like your mother.

180
00:20:31,164 --> 00:20:33,030
It was hard for him.

181
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:36,667
And for me.

182
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:49,580
So is silver falls
really haunted?

183
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:52,016
Or was Larry
just pulling my leg?

184
00:20:52,018 --> 00:20:53,351
No.

185
00:20:53,353 --> 00:20:55,353
But we do have
some ghosts in the house.

186
00:20:55,355 --> 00:20:58,055
And the bodies
we keep in the basement.

187
00:20:58,057 --> 00:20:59,924
So that's the smell.

188
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:02,960
No, that's my cooking.

189
00:21:08,534 --> 00:21:09,834
Hey, it's Larry.

190
00:21:09,836 --> 00:21:11,469
You don't have
to leave a message.

191
00:21:11,471 --> 00:21:15,773
I have caller I.D.
And will now commence stalking.

192
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,364
Don't tell me.

193
00:22:13,366 --> 00:22:17,068
Miss Hollywood.

194
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:20,137
And you must be looking
for my handsome son.

195
00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:22,540
The valedictorian.

196
00:22:22,542 --> 00:22:25,476
Who scored 2400 on his S.A.T.S.

197
00:22:25,478 --> 00:22:28,312
- Hi, Mr. Parrish.
- Dr. Parrish.

198
00:22:28,314 --> 00:22:31,282
Dr. Parrish.

199
00:22:31,284 --> 00:22:35,553
Jordan, not "miss Hollywood."

200
00:22:35,555 --> 00:22:37,621
But the same Jordan
who got my son arrested

201
00:22:37,623 --> 00:22:40,324
for carrying enough alprazolam
to sedate a horse.

202
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:43,194
- No.
No, not that Jordan.

203
00:22:43,196 --> 00:22:45,229
How's that gonna look
on a Stanford application,

204
00:22:45,231 --> 00:22:46,530
do you think?

205
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:49,300
They don't have to know.

206
00:22:49,302 --> 00:22:52,470
He was arrested.

207
00:22:52,472 --> 00:22:55,773
By who, Robbie's dad?

208
00:22:55,775 --> 00:22:57,608
I mean, I'm sure
we can work something out.

209
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:00,010
Hmm, so you've been here
two weeks

210
00:23:00,012 --> 00:23:02,513
and you've got us dialed in,
don't you?

211
00:23:02,515 --> 00:23:04,315
- No, I'm just...
- Staying away from my son.

212
00:23:04,317 --> 00:23:05,916
He's grounded.

213
00:23:05,918 --> 00:23:08,452
You can see him at school,
because I can't help that,

214
00:23:08,454 --> 00:23:10,988
but that's it.

215
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:13,157
Good-bye, Jordan.

216
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:27,638
Jordan.

217
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:34,104
We might be
in over our heads.

218
00:24:34,106 --> 00:24:36,240
We can deal.

219
00:24:36,242 --> 00:24:38,909
With anything, right?

220
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:43,214
Right.

221
00:24:43,216 --> 00:24:46,217
My turn.

222
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:58,295
It's not nice
to sneak around.

223
00:24:58,297 --> 00:25:01,298
I didn't mean to.

224
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:07,805
My door keeps opening.

225
00:25:07,807 --> 00:25:11,208
Oh. Country homes
have their own personality.

226
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:14,111
Your door's
just expressing itself.

227
00:25:14,113 --> 00:25:16,780
I locked it.

228
00:25:16,782 --> 00:25:18,048
Then it wouldn't have opened.

229
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:20,150
Maybe you thought
you locked it.

230
00:25:20,152 --> 00:25:22,987
Look, if you're scared,
you can sleep with us.

231
00:25:22,989 --> 00:25:26,190
Kevin, that...
that sounded bad.

232
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:29,593
I meant in here
on a sleeping bag.

233
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:34,098
I'm not sleeping very well.

234
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,233
There's a wool blanket
in the second closet.

235
00:25:36,235 --> 00:25:39,470
It's heavy.
It might help you sleep.

236
00:25:39,472 --> 00:25:42,339
And, Jordan, next time,

237
00:25:42,341 --> 00:25:45,543
when our door is shut
and you need something,

238
00:25:45,545 --> 00:25:46,045
knock.

239
00:28:19,764 --> 00:28:21,899
Have you seen my silk scarf?

240
00:28:21,901 --> 00:28:23,967
It's black and gold.

241
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:26,637
Actually, don't ask me how,

242
00:28:26,639 --> 00:28:29,440
but it's hermes.

243
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:33,777
I had it in my room,
but it's gone.

244
00:28:38,783 --> 00:28:41,251
Did my mom sleepwalk?

245
00:28:41,253 --> 00:28:44,521
No.

246
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:51,061
Maybe I sleepwalk.

247
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:53,597
The pictures.
The door.

248
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:55,733
Stuff.

249
00:28:55,735 --> 00:28:57,534
Maybe.

250
00:28:57,536 --> 00:29:00,938
Or maybe it's the wind.

251
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:06,343
Oh, by the way, I found some
candy wrappers in your room.

252
00:29:06,345 --> 00:29:08,312
Be careful.

253
00:29:08,314 --> 00:29:11,648
We get mice.

254
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:13,150
I'm gonna be late.

255
00:29:13,152 --> 00:29:15,753
It's black and gold,
the scarf.

256
00:29:15,755 --> 00:29:17,888
If you see it.

257
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:31,762
After you.

258
00:30:31,764 --> 00:30:36,600
Now isn't this better?

259
00:30:36,602 --> 00:30:38,602
Only a matter of time.

260
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,462
Come here.

261
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:24,047
Did Robbie
really drive you home?

262
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:25,148
I couldn't find you.

263
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:27,451
- Don't...
- What?

264
00:31:27,453 --> 00:31:30,187
Give me the "we should be
friends" speech.

265
00:31:30,189 --> 00:31:33,190
I know it by memory.

266
00:31:33,192 --> 00:31:36,126
Why would I do that?

267
00:31:36,128 --> 00:31:37,995
Robbie said
he drove you home.

268
00:31:37,997 --> 00:31:40,130
Emphasis on "drove."

269
00:31:40,132 --> 00:31:43,300
And you believed him?

270
00:31:43,302 --> 00:31:45,102
Well, not at first,
but I figured

271
00:31:45,104 --> 00:31:47,537
I was just being delusional.

272
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:53,777
Robbie doesn't know anything
about driving.

273
00:31:53,779 --> 00:31:55,646
But you do.

274
00:31:55,648 --> 00:32:01,518
- No.
No, no.

275
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,053
Actually, yeah.

276
00:32:03,055 --> 00:32:05,656
Yes, I do.

277
00:32:05,658 --> 00:32:10,627
You drive with your heart.

278
00:32:10,629 --> 00:32:13,697
I so did not want
to be your friend.

279
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,835
How long
are you grounded for?

280
00:32:18,837 --> 00:32:21,371
I told my dad
that I bought the stuff,

281
00:32:21,373 --> 00:32:24,074
but he doesn't believe me.
- Oh.

282
00:32:24,076 --> 00:32:26,843
He thinks
you're the anti-Christ.

283
00:32:26,845 --> 00:32:31,048
Well, don't worry.
I know how to sneak around.

284
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:32,349
And I won't be grounded
for long.

285
00:32:32,351 --> 00:32:34,518
My dad's a shrink,

286
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:37,054
and he'll just read a report
about confinement

287
00:32:37,056 --> 00:32:42,726
and adolescence,
and then he'll cave.

288
00:32:42,728 --> 00:32:44,227
Parents.

289
00:32:44,229 --> 00:32:48,031
Just got to wait 'em out.

290
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:55,105
Why can't I find a single book
on the paranormal,

291
00:32:55,107 --> 00:32:57,107
ghosts, or spirits?

292
00:32:57,109 --> 00:32:59,142
Well, you're
in the school library.

293
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:03,113
No one expects you to read.

294
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:06,717
I was just kidding
about all that stuff

295
00:33:06,719 --> 00:33:09,219
the other night.

296
00:33:09,221 --> 00:33:12,122
My bedroom door opens
by itself.

297
00:33:12,124 --> 00:33:14,558
Good to know.

298
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,625
What about your window?

299
00:33:15,627 --> 00:33:18,028
Seriously.
That's creepy.

300
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:22,132
Houses have a mind
of their own.

301
00:33:22,134 --> 00:33:24,434
And I can't
get this ring off.

302
00:33:24,436 --> 00:33:27,304
It's been a couple days.

303
00:33:27,306 --> 00:33:30,707
I actually know about this.

304
00:33:30,709 --> 00:33:33,844
Come on.

305
00:33:33,846 --> 00:33:37,214
Yeah.
- Ooh, boys' room.

306
00:33:37,216 --> 00:33:39,716
- Yeah.
- Okay.

307
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,621
Mm.

308
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,066
It's gonna hurt.

309
00:33:56,068 --> 00:33:59,136
It's not gonna hurt, okay?

310
00:33:59,138 --> 00:34:02,305
Come here.

311
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:20,190
See?
- I told you.

312
00:34:20,192 --> 00:34:22,826
I swear, I felt it.

313
00:34:22,828 --> 00:34:24,961
It was off.

314
00:34:24,963 --> 00:34:26,196
Creepy, right?

315
00:34:26,198 --> 00:34:27,764
Who gave it to you anyway?

316
00:34:27,766 --> 00:34:29,466
Robbie?

317
00:34:29,468 --> 00:34:32,102
I found it in the woods
at silver falls.

318
00:34:32,104 --> 00:34:35,405
I heard you whispering my name,
then I saw it at my feet.

319
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:39,843
No, I didn't whisper.

320
00:34:39,845 --> 00:34:41,745
Well, I thought
maybe you dropped it.

321
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:44,514
So this isn't even your ring?

322
00:34:44,516 --> 00:34:48,752
No, and to be honest, I don't
really remember putting it on.

323
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:52,489
It's like...
I'm not crazy,

324
00:34:52,491 --> 00:34:56,660
but it's like it chose me.

325
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,363
Okay, well,
we're getting it off.

326
00:35:00,365 --> 00:35:02,532
Let me just figure out how.

327
00:35:02,534 --> 00:35:04,835
Come on.

328
00:35:47,745 --> 00:35:49,779
Hey, Jordan.

329
00:35:49,781 --> 00:35:54,251
Have a seat.

330
00:35:54,253 --> 00:35:57,220
What's up?

331
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:04,494
They sent your file.

332
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:06,530
File?

333
00:36:06,532 --> 00:36:08,398
The executor
of your father's will.

334
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,467
He wanted us to be prepared,

335
00:36:10,469 --> 00:36:12,302
because we don't have kids.

336
00:36:12,304 --> 00:36:15,505
You got caught shoplifting
when you were 12.

337
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:17,774
You smoked pot.
You did drugs.

338
00:36:19,443 --> 00:36:21,378
My dad got a new girlfriend.

339
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:23,647
I was acting out.

340
00:36:23,649 --> 00:36:25,448
It was obvious.

341
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:27,717
Like, I knew
I was gonna get caught.

342
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:31,221
Then why did you
want to get caught here?

343
00:36:31,223 --> 00:36:32,822
What?

344
00:36:32,824 --> 00:36:38,461
Jordan, we know
you're mourning your father.

345
00:36:38,463 --> 00:36:40,630
You miss him.
This is a new town.

346
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:44,034
Maybe you think
we're a little strange.

347
00:36:44,036 --> 00:36:45,902
But we're really normal.

348
00:36:45,904 --> 00:36:48,338
I like it here.

349
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:51,808
Then why'd you go
in my wallet?

350
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:52,809
And my scarf.

351
00:36:52,811 --> 00:36:55,145
Your mother gave me that scarf.

352
00:36:55,147 --> 00:36:56,313
What are you talking about?

353
00:36:56,315 --> 00:36:57,647
Come on, Jordan,

354
00:36:57,649 --> 00:36:58,648
maybe we've never been
parents before,

355
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:00,050
but we're not stupid.

356
00:37:00,052 --> 00:37:01,484
Are you on drugs now?

357
00:37:01,486 --> 00:37:02,919
No, don't answer that.

358
00:37:02,921 --> 00:37:04,354
What's going on?

359
00:37:04,356 --> 00:37:06,189
- You tell us.
- I can't until you tell me

360
00:37:06,191 --> 00:37:07,624
what you think I did.
- Goddamn it,

361
00:37:07,626 --> 00:37:10,327
you stole from us!
You took our stuff.

362
00:37:10,329 --> 00:37:12,229
- What makes you think I did it?
- We found them.

363
00:37:12,231 --> 00:37:13,763
In your underwear drawer.

364
00:37:13,765 --> 00:37:15,765
You went in my room
in my drawers?

365
00:37:15,767 --> 00:37:17,234
Don't turn it around on us.

366
00:37:17,236 --> 00:37:18,602
I swear
on the penalty of death,

367
00:37:18,604 --> 00:37:21,771
I didn't take your shit.

368
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:28,378
We made an appointment
for you to talk to someone.

369
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,847
Dr. Parrish.

370
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:32,349
Dr. Parrish?

371
00:37:32,351 --> 00:37:34,684
He'll see you tomorrow.

372
00:37:34,686 --> 00:37:38,622
I'll see anyone you want.

373
00:37:38,624 --> 00:37:40,624
You can come.
Just, please, not Larry's dad.

374
00:37:40,626 --> 00:37:42,425
I can't drive you 40 Miles

375
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:44,361
to the next therapist.

376
00:37:44,363 --> 00:37:45,362
And there's another problem.

377
00:37:45,364 --> 00:37:47,330
Tonight is date night.

378
00:37:47,332 --> 00:37:50,233
Well, I don't know
what that means.

379
00:37:50,235 --> 00:37:55,505
Date night means that
I will not neglect my wife...

380
00:37:55,507 --> 00:37:57,641
Because you're now a member
of this family.

381
00:37:57,643 --> 00:38:00,610
- No kids allowed.
- I'm not a kid.

382
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:02,779
- You're part of our home.

383
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:05,982
We just can't have you
stealing from it.

384
00:38:05,984 --> 00:38:09,719
So we're going out tonight
as planned.

385
00:38:09,721 --> 00:38:13,823
But you're staying in.

386
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:33,943
- So sad.
- Mm.

387
00:38:33,945 --> 00:38:38,815
I know this might seem
a bit extreme to you.

388
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:42,986
You'll talk to Dr. Parrish,
and things will be fine.

389
00:38:46,557 --> 00:38:48,358
Don't hate us, Jordan.

390
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:52,495
But please don't use us.

391
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:54,831
That's good.

392
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:57,367
Date night.

393
00:39:00,771 --> 00:39:06,142
Cock-sucking motherfucker,
goddamn asshole.

394
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:25,128
I'm gonna have
to unhinge the door.

395
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:28,765
We are awful, awful people.

396
00:39:34,973 --> 00:39:36,406
We are not that bad.

397
00:39:36,408 --> 00:39:40,610
No, we're not that bad.

398
00:39:40,612 --> 00:39:42,178
We make mistakes.

399
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,480
We're gonna learn,

400
00:39:43,482 --> 00:39:44,814
and Jordan's gonna learn.

401
00:39:44,816 --> 00:39:47,150
Kevin, we imprisoned her.

402
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,488
Well, what if she
would have found our stash?

403
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:55,058
Then we lose the upper hand.

404
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,694
What?

405
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:59,729
We definitely failed

406
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:03,199
child-proofing 101.

407
00:40:05,103 --> 00:40:06,603
Oh, man.

408
00:40:06,605 --> 00:40:11,174
Well, is date night over?

409
00:40:11,176 --> 00:40:14,277
Is that what you want?

410
00:40:14,279 --> 00:40:17,947
I want what you want.

411
00:41:50,975 --> 00:41:53,076
There's no way

412
00:41:53,078 --> 00:41:55,278
you could drive.
There's no way.

413
00:42:10,995 --> 00:42:13,029
Jordan.

414
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:14,631
Jordan?

415
00:42:14,633 --> 00:42:19,135
What the hell?

416
00:42:19,137 --> 00:42:22,305
Jordan.

417
00:42:22,307 --> 00:42:24,774
Jordan!

418
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:36,019
- It's locked.
- Jordan, open the door.

419
00:42:36,021 --> 00:42:38,788
- Jordan.
I'm going to kick it down.

420
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:40,523
- Open the door.
Open it up.

421
00:42:40,525 --> 00:42:44,527
Jordan,
I'm gonna kick it down!

422
00:42:44,529 --> 00:42:50,199
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

423
00:42:53,437 --> 00:42:55,872
My medicine.

424
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,219
Okay.
All right.

425
00:43:10,221 --> 00:43:13,056
Okay.
I'm giving you haloperidol.

426
00:43:13,058 --> 00:43:15,892
This is haloperidol.
It's gonna help you.

427
00:43:22,399 --> 00:43:24,767
We did good.

428
00:43:28,238 --> 00:43:31,541
She's soaked.

429
00:43:31,543 --> 00:43:34,911
Let's get her clothes off
and get her to bed.

430
00:44:34,304 --> 00:44:35,872
Hey.

431
00:44:35,874 --> 00:44:37,840
I'm Jordan.

432
00:44:41,979 --> 00:44:46,249
So does she have a name?

433
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:54,724
She special?
Like, short bus special?

434
00:44:56,794 --> 00:44:58,361
What is this?

435
00:44:58,363 --> 00:45:01,464
Like, some sort
of reverse psychology?

436
00:45:01,466 --> 00:45:03,766
Like, invite another foster kid
in and create some sort

437
00:45:03,768 --> 00:45:07,070
of a sibling rivalry?

438
00:45:07,072 --> 00:45:11,741
Oh, God.
This isn't happening.

439
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:17,213
Jordan, it's over now.

440
00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:20,783
We are so sorry.

441
00:45:20,785 --> 00:45:23,086
Your mother was claustrophobic.

442
00:45:23,088 --> 00:45:26,956
We didn't know
that you were too.

443
00:45:26,958 --> 00:45:28,458
We won't be doing
anything like that again.

444
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:31,094
You have an appointment
with Dr. Parrish

445
00:45:31,096 --> 00:45:34,430
this morning before school.

446
00:45:34,432 --> 00:45:36,432
I can't breathe.

447
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:41,704
How many pills
did you give her?

448
00:45:41,706 --> 00:45:45,975
Just the one.

449
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,257
Jordan.

450
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:03,960
It's a new day.
It can't be stopped.

451
00:46:03,962 --> 00:46:06,395
Deal with it.

452
00:46:29,487 --> 00:46:32,822
Seat belt.

453
00:47:13,197 --> 00:47:17,400
Are there legends
about silver falls?

454
00:47:17,402 --> 00:47:18,734
What kind?

455
00:47:18,736 --> 00:47:21,737
Ones involving a ring?

456
00:47:21,739 --> 00:47:24,941
You mean like lost treasure?

457
00:47:24,943 --> 00:47:28,578
Ghosts.

458
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:31,447
There's ash man.

459
00:47:31,449 --> 00:47:33,349
Burned American Indian.

460
00:47:33,351 --> 00:47:35,952
That's more of a yeti thing.

461
00:47:35,954 --> 00:47:37,486
You know, to attract tourists.

462
00:47:37,488 --> 00:47:41,457
No, like,
maybe involving a girl?

463
00:47:41,459 --> 00:47:44,794
Maybe my age?

464
00:47:44,796 --> 00:47:47,396
You seen a ghost?

465
00:47:47,398 --> 00:47:50,800
No, it's a creative writing
assignment for school.

466
00:47:50,802 --> 00:47:52,969
Uh-huh.

467
00:47:52,971 --> 00:47:56,005
You like to write?

468
00:47:56,007 --> 00:47:58,374
Your mother wrote.

469
00:47:58,376 --> 00:48:02,111
I just want to base it
on something real.

470
00:48:02,113 --> 00:48:04,513
Make it authentic.

471
00:48:11,989 --> 00:48:13,990
Find your face.

472
00:48:13,992 --> 00:48:15,658
Not your forever face.

473
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:18,461
Your for now face.

474
00:48:20,931 --> 00:48:24,533
There are no bad faces, Jordan.

475
00:48:24,535 --> 00:48:29,472
You're not leaving here
until you do this.

476
00:48:34,478 --> 00:48:37,113
Do you always see
your patients in your kitchen?

477
00:48:39,217 --> 00:48:41,183
I meet my patients
where I believe

478
00:48:41,185 --> 00:48:43,152
they'll be the most comfortable.

479
00:48:43,154 --> 00:48:45,454
My office is at the hospital.

480
00:48:45,456 --> 00:48:49,225
Would your prefer
to meet there?

481
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:56,699
Oh.
And what are we happy about?

482
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:01,871
That we just completed
the task,

483
00:49:01,873 --> 00:49:04,640
so we get to move on.

484
00:49:04,642 --> 00:49:08,778
Are you sleeping?

485
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:10,179
Like a baby.

486
00:49:10,181 --> 00:49:12,148
Are you afraid?

487
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:14,150
Of being left alone?

488
00:49:14,152 --> 00:49:17,053
I prefer it.

489
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:19,021
Mm.

490
00:49:19,023 --> 00:49:23,926
Your grades, Jordan,
they've been...

491
00:49:23,928 --> 00:49:26,462
Up and down.

492
00:49:32,202 --> 00:49:35,404
Is there someone else
in the room?

493
00:49:35,406 --> 00:49:36,739
- No.
- Are they telling you

494
00:49:36,741 --> 00:49:39,075
not to trust me?

495
00:49:39,077 --> 00:49:42,044
Are you hearing things?

496
00:49:42,046 --> 00:49:45,247
'Cause you keep looking
over there.

497
00:49:47,951 --> 00:49:49,218
I'm nervous.

498
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:54,023
Are you afraid
of what's in your file?

499
00:49:55,892 --> 00:49:57,326
No.

500
00:49:57,328 --> 00:50:01,330
'Cause you look troubled.

501
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:03,299
I have a math test.

502
00:50:03,301 --> 00:50:06,902
Okay.

503
00:50:06,904 --> 00:50:09,038
I want to see you once a week.

504
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,906
Wednesdays?

505
00:50:10,908 --> 00:50:13,275
But if you continue
to lie to me

506
00:50:13,277 --> 00:50:15,778
and avoid my questions,

507
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:19,648
I'm gonna want to see you
every morning.

508
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:21,550
And when I see you next time,
I want you

509
00:50:21,552 --> 00:50:26,622
to tell me something that
no one else knows about you.

510
00:50:47,879 --> 00:50:50,112
You okay?

511
00:50:50,114 --> 00:50:52,748
No.

512
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:56,819
I knew you'd get tired
of pretending you liked it here.

513
00:50:56,821 --> 00:50:58,988
Look.

514
00:50:58,990 --> 00:51:00,756
There's this place I go

515
00:51:00,758 --> 00:51:05,261
when everything seems
to get to be just too much.

516
00:51:05,263 --> 00:51:09,632
It's a little waterfall
over in silver falls.

517
00:51:09,634 --> 00:51:11,700
You can walk behind it.

518
00:51:11,702 --> 00:51:13,969
Why would I want to do that?

519
00:51:13,971 --> 00:51:16,872
Watch the icicles melt?

520
00:51:18,675 --> 00:51:23,779
Things seem to go right for me
after I go there.

521
00:51:23,781 --> 00:51:26,415
Do you want to go?

522
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:28,651
Hey, leave her alone.

523
00:51:32,656 --> 00:51:35,324
Or what?

524
00:51:35,326 --> 00:51:37,460
Nothing.
Just stop being a jerk,

525
00:51:37,462 --> 00:51:40,162
and you can just go...
- Robbie, stop!

526
00:51:40,164 --> 00:51:41,430
Get off him.

527
00:51:41,432 --> 00:51:43,132
What's wrong with you?

528
00:51:43,134 --> 00:51:45,868
Get off.
- Get off.

529
00:51:48,738 --> 00:51:51,674
Just showing him
how it's done.

530
00:51:57,681 --> 00:51:59,482
Are you okay?

531
00:51:59,484 --> 00:52:00,950
Are you just gonna let him
do that?

532
00:52:00,952 --> 00:52:03,786
He's just like his dad.

533
00:52:03,788 --> 00:52:05,821
He gets away with murder.

534
00:52:05,823 --> 00:52:08,224
Always has.

535
00:52:08,226 --> 00:52:09,859
I'll be fine.

536
00:52:09,861 --> 00:52:13,095
I was actually about to get
the upper hand.

537
00:52:13,097 --> 00:52:15,331
I think he knew it.

538
00:52:20,003 --> 00:52:24,240
Let's ditch.

539
00:52:24,242 --> 00:52:27,009
I have
a killer attendance record.

540
00:52:27,011 --> 00:52:29,945
- Not anymore.
Come on.

541
00:52:29,947 --> 00:52:31,113
Where do you want to go?

542
00:52:31,115 --> 00:52:33,349
The cemetery.

543
00:52:33,351 --> 00:52:35,918
I was thinking the same thing.
Cemetery.

544
00:52:57,707 --> 00:52:59,308
Um...

545
00:52:59,310 --> 00:53:01,277
You're looking for someone?

546
00:53:01,279 --> 00:53:04,280
'Cause I-I could help.

547
00:53:04,282 --> 00:53:06,649
I don't know the name.

548
00:53:06,651 --> 00:53:10,119
Okay, what's going on
with you?

549
00:53:10,121 --> 00:53:12,121
Saw your father today.

550
00:53:12,123 --> 00:53:14,590
- Really?
Office or kitchen?

551
00:53:14,592 --> 00:53:15,624
Kitchen.

552
00:53:15,626 --> 00:53:21,197
- Good.
What'd you tell him?

553
00:53:21,199 --> 00:53:22,698
You seeing him twice a week?

554
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:24,900
Once.

555
00:53:24,902 --> 00:53:26,569
Good.

556
00:53:26,571 --> 00:53:30,606
Did he ask you what's your first
memory of elementary school?

557
00:53:30,608 --> 00:53:35,411
No. I have to tell him
something no one else knows.

558
00:53:36,613 --> 00:53:39,882
That's more serious.

559
00:53:39,884 --> 00:53:40,883
What are you gonna say?

560
00:53:40,885 --> 00:53:42,451
That I like to hold my pee in

561
00:53:42,453 --> 00:53:43,719
till the absolute last second.

562
00:53:43,721 --> 00:53:46,255
You know, man over nature.

563
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:50,759
Oh, God.
You're good.

564
00:53:50,761 --> 00:53:53,862
You've done this before, huh?

565
00:53:53,864 --> 00:53:55,998
Look, a lot of people
have talked to my father.

566
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,333
It's a small town.

567
00:53:57,335 --> 00:53:58,801
But don't worry.

568
00:53:58,803 --> 00:54:01,303
He won't say anything
you've said.

569
00:54:01,305 --> 00:54:06,041
I'm gonna tell you something
that's actually true.

570
00:54:07,444 --> 00:54:11,513
You can trust me.

571
00:54:11,515 --> 00:54:15,517
I'm being followed
by a dead girl.

572
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:20,656
Where?

573
00:54:20,658 --> 00:54:24,293
She's behind you.

574
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:30,599
What's she look like?

575
00:54:30,601 --> 00:54:34,336
You know, my mom was crazy.

576
00:54:34,338 --> 00:54:36,972
My dad told me.

577
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:41,543
She didn't just drown.

578
00:54:41,545 --> 00:54:45,080
She walked into the water.

579
00:54:49,085 --> 00:54:52,121
It's happening.

580
00:54:52,123 --> 00:54:54,356
I'm turning into her.

581
00:54:54,358 --> 00:54:56,725
She saw dead giris?

582
00:54:56,727 --> 00:54:58,661
- No.
I don't know.

583
00:55:01,299 --> 00:55:04,733
Well, what does she want?

584
00:55:06,903 --> 00:55:09,538
I think she wants us
to follow her.

585
00:55:12,409 --> 00:55:15,978
You... you lead the way.

586
00:55:33,963 --> 00:55:35,764
You think she's headed
to water street?

587
00:55:35,766 --> 00:55:38,534
You'd know better than me.

588
00:55:47,143 --> 00:55:52,681
Wait up a sec.

589
00:55:52,683 --> 00:55:55,484
Do all your girlfriends
see the dead?

590
00:55:55,486 --> 00:55:59,121
Um, only the ones I like.

591
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:06,895
Crazy feels really normal.

592
00:56:10,767 --> 00:56:13,535
Sort of.

593
00:56:25,248 --> 00:56:27,416
She stopped.

594
00:56:27,418 --> 00:56:29,952
Where did she stop?

595
00:56:29,954 --> 00:56:33,122
Outside that bar.

596
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:48,371
My God.

597
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:25,274
Jordan.

598
00:57:25,276 --> 00:57:27,309
Jordan, what are you doing?

599
00:57:27,311 --> 00:57:30,245
Hey, hey, son,
you got some I.D.?

600
00:57:30,247 --> 00:57:31,547
Wyatt dahl's scheduled
to be executed

601
00:57:31,549 --> 00:57:33,549
tonight at 11:00 P.M.

602
00:57:33,551 --> 00:57:35,584
Dahl was tried and convicted

603
00:57:35,586 --> 00:57:37,019
for the brutal slaying
of his twin daughters

604
00:57:37,021 --> 00:57:38,987
holly and Heather dahl,
and he's been sitting

605
00:57:38,989 --> 00:57:41,156
on death row for over 20 years.

606
00:57:41,158 --> 00:57:43,292
I know who she is.

607
00:57:43,294 --> 00:57:45,894
I know this looks bad.

608
00:57:45,896 --> 00:57:48,564
But it's the best thing
for you.

609
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,834
I trusted you.

610
00:57:51,836 --> 00:57:55,971
And you think I let you down.

611
00:57:55,973 --> 00:57:57,840
But it's only
because I like you.

612
00:57:57,842 --> 00:58:01,043
It's going to be okay.
We know exactly what to do.

613
00:58:01,045 --> 00:58:02,144
We have a plan.

614
00:58:02,146 --> 00:58:03,579
I'm not crazy.

615
00:58:03,581 --> 00:58:06,381
I'm not crazy.

616
00:58:06,383 --> 00:58:07,716
No, I'm not like my mother.

617
00:58:07,718 --> 00:58:10,052
I'm not!
- No, there's no need for that.

618
00:58:10,054 --> 00:58:11,653
We'll just take this
to my place.

619
00:58:11,655 --> 00:58:14,623
We'll have a nice little chat.

620
00:58:14,625 --> 00:58:16,725
- Come on.
Let's go.

621
00:58:16,727 --> 00:58:20,529
That's all right.

622
00:58:57,634 --> 00:58:59,167
I hate you.

623
00:58:59,169 --> 00:59:00,168
I know.

624
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:01,703
All of you.

625
00:59:01,705 --> 00:59:05,040
Okay, we are going
to have a conversation.

626
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:07,442
If you get violent,
you will be sedated.

627
00:59:07,444 --> 00:59:10,312
Understood?

628
00:59:10,314 --> 00:59:13,248
Out.

629
00:59:14,817 --> 00:59:18,854
Thanks for this.
Better go wait outside.

630
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:25,727
I want Larry to leave too.

631
00:59:25,729 --> 00:59:27,396
He stays.

632
00:59:27,398 --> 00:59:29,932
He lives here.

633
00:59:29,934 --> 00:59:32,834
And like the rest of us,
this legend of the dahl twins

634
00:59:32,836 --> 00:59:36,538
has caused this town
a great deal of grief.

635
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:38,173
I don't know anything
about the twins.

636
00:59:38,175 --> 00:59:40,409
I just know that one of them
is shadowing me.

637
00:59:40,411 --> 00:59:41,410
Follows you?

638
00:59:41,412 --> 00:59:42,844
Rides in the car?

639
00:59:42,846 --> 00:59:45,547
Meets you at school?

640
00:59:45,549 --> 00:59:47,950
Turns on faucets?

641
00:59:47,952 --> 00:59:51,820
Crawls into bed with you?

642
00:59:51,822 --> 00:59:53,956
<i>There are variations
for the folie a deux.</i>

643
00:59:53,958 --> 00:59:56,625
I don't know what that means.

644
00:59:56,627 --> 00:59:59,161
It's French for madness

645
00:59:59,163 --> 01:00:00,495
shared by two.

646
01:00:00,497 --> 01:00:02,664
First discovered in Paris
at the turn of the century

647
01:00:02,666 --> 01:00:04,132
in a set of twin giris.

648
01:00:04,134 --> 01:00:09,171
They both believed in an
alternative versión of reality.

649
01:00:09,173 --> 01:00:10,772
What reality?

650
01:00:10,774 --> 01:00:14,576
You're not the first to have
seen one of the dahl twins.

651
01:00:14,578 --> 01:00:16,578
Jenny mcadams was the first.

652
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:18,780
She told susie Childs.

653
01:00:18,782 --> 01:00:20,248
Susie told Nancy Fitz.

654
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:22,351
And before you knew it,
all three claimed

655
01:00:22,353 --> 01:00:24,386
to have seen one of the twins.

656
01:00:24,388 --> 01:00:28,457
But I just found out
they existed an hour ago.

657
01:00:28,459 --> 01:00:29,658
Nobody told me anything.

658
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:32,628
I did.

659
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:34,262
We were at silver falls.

660
01:00:34,264 --> 01:00:36,732
How could you?

661
01:00:36,734 --> 01:00:38,834
- He's lying.
What are you doing?

662
01:00:38,836 --> 01:00:41,203
It's one thing to snitch on me.
It's another to set me up.

663
01:00:41,205 --> 01:00:43,739
It wasn't by name,
but I told you

664
01:00:43,741 --> 01:00:45,941
about the candy, the doors,
the appliances.

665
01:00:45,943 --> 01:00:47,776
I thought it'd be okay

666
01:00:47,778 --> 01:00:49,344
because she was
from out of town

667
01:00:49,346 --> 01:00:51,146
and she wouldn't know about it.

668
01:00:51,148 --> 01:00:52,881
After everything
that's happened?

669
01:00:52,883 --> 01:00:54,182
I didn't mean it.

670
01:00:54,184 --> 01:00:56,952
I just wanted her to like me.

671
01:01:11,934 --> 01:01:15,170
So you're saying
I made it up?

672
01:01:15,172 --> 01:01:18,940
No, but you are embracing
the delusión.

673
01:01:18,942 --> 01:01:21,643
Listen,
delusions are the mind's way

674
01:01:21,645 --> 01:01:23,311
of easing the pain of reality.

675
01:01:23,313 --> 01:01:24,980
It's normal.

676
01:01:24,982 --> 01:01:27,382
Except when they're contagious.

677
01:01:27,384 --> 01:01:28,950
Well, can I talk to Jenny

678
01:01:28,952 --> 01:01:32,721
and Nancy and susie,
whatever their names are?

679
01:01:32,723 --> 01:01:34,756
They thought Wyatt
was innocent

680
01:01:34,758 --> 01:01:36,091
and the real killer
was after them.

681
01:01:36,093 --> 01:01:38,727
They believed their delusión,

682
01:01:38,729 --> 01:01:40,495
and in order
to escape the reality,

683
01:01:40,497 --> 01:01:44,032
they committed suicide.

684
01:01:44,034 --> 01:01:46,301
Jumped into silver falls.

685
01:01:48,071 --> 01:01:51,039
Well, is Wyatt innocent?

686
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:52,708
That sick bastard
bludgeoned Heather

687
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:55,243
while holly watched.
- Just shut up.

688
01:01:55,245 --> 01:01:58,213
She doesn't need
any more details.

689
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:03,151
Jordan, you have a choice.

690
01:02:05,088 --> 01:02:07,055
You can embrace reality,
all of it,

691
01:02:07,057 --> 01:02:09,458
the good and the bad,

692
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:12,094
or die by delusión.

693
01:02:12,096 --> 01:02:13,995
After Nancy's death,

694
01:02:13,997 --> 01:02:16,231
we had an epidemic
on our hands.

695
01:02:16,233 --> 01:02:18,133
Giris were coming
out of the woodwork

696
01:02:18,135 --> 01:02:21,303
with holly dahl sightings.

697
01:02:21,305 --> 01:02:23,505
I spoke to Wyatt, and he agreed

698
01:02:23,507 --> 01:02:25,707
to talk to anyone
who had seen his daughter.

699
01:02:25,709 --> 01:02:27,576
Now it's my professional opinion

700
01:02:27,578 --> 01:02:29,811
that you should do the same.

701
01:02:29,813 --> 01:02:31,179
What will happen?

702
01:02:31,181 --> 01:02:33,181
Well, that's
between you and him.

703
01:02:33,183 --> 01:02:35,517
I will say that I've taken
five giris to see him,

704
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:37,519
and all five
have stopped seeing holly.

705
01:02:37,521 --> 01:02:41,189
Well, can I talk to them?
The giris?

706
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:47,295
- No.
No, I couldn't risk it.

707
01:02:47,297 --> 01:02:50,832
It could cause them a relapse.

708
01:02:56,806 --> 01:02:58,540
- Okay.
- Good.

709
01:02:58,542 --> 01:03:00,308
- All right,
but we'd better hurry.

710
01:03:00,310 --> 01:03:02,177
Portland's 30 minutes away.

711
01:03:02,179 --> 01:03:04,980
He's gonna be dead
in a few hours.

712
01:03:23,733 --> 01:03:28,236
Sorry for eating in front
of you, but my time is short.

713
01:03:28,238 --> 01:03:31,506
She's one of Parrish's giris.

714
01:03:31,508 --> 01:03:35,243
I need to talk to her alone.
Like the others.

715
01:03:40,249 --> 01:03:42,217
So...

716
01:03:42,219 --> 01:03:44,219
How's little doc Parrish?

717
01:03:44,221 --> 01:03:47,923
He's an asshole.

718
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:53,595
So what do you tell
the giris that come here?

719
01:03:53,597 --> 01:03:55,230
Depends.

720
01:03:55,232 --> 01:03:57,532
On what?

721
01:03:57,534 --> 01:04:00,001
What they tell me.

722
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:08,944
Are you afraid to die?

723
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:13,348
Holly wasn't afraid to die.

724
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:15,550
She's a good girl.
She believed in God.

725
01:04:15,552 --> 01:04:17,485
Heather, on the other hand,

726
01:04:17,487 --> 01:04:21,223
she was afraid
that she'd be forgotten.

727
01:04:23,826 --> 01:04:26,595
She had a mean streak,
that one.

728
01:04:26,597 --> 01:04:29,164
Is that why you killed her?

729
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:39,441
Is it hard to take off?

730
01:04:39,443 --> 01:04:42,210
What's that?

731
01:04:42,212 --> 01:04:45,280
- Your ring?
- No.

732
01:04:45,282 --> 01:04:49,184
Mine is.

733
01:04:53,789 --> 01:04:55,457
Where'd you get that?

734
01:04:55,459 --> 01:04:57,459
Found it.

735
01:04:57,461 --> 01:05:00,862
Why do you wear it
on that finger?

736
01:05:00,864 --> 01:05:03,965
I guess I picked
the wrong one.

737
01:05:10,139 --> 01:05:12,207
Last time I saw my giris,

738
01:05:12,209 --> 01:05:16,011
they were on a school bus.

739
01:05:16,013 --> 01:05:21,750
Holly... holly pointed
to her ring,

740
01:05:21,752 --> 01:05:26,955
Heather to hers,
and me to mine.

741
01:05:26,957 --> 01:05:29,591
We bought these
at a flea market.

742
01:05:29,593 --> 01:05:33,862
Holly liked the idea
that it was one ring

743
01:05:33,864 --> 01:05:36,598
and we each got a part.

744
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:39,200
Three parts to a whole.

745
01:05:42,705 --> 01:05:47,976
I never thought that'd be
the last time I'd see my kids.

746
01:05:57,987 --> 01:06:01,289
Put that on when you go home.

747
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:02,524
Watch out for Heather.

748
01:06:02,526 --> 01:06:04,492
She's not the same
since she died.

749
01:06:04,494 --> 01:06:06,795
My giris are trying
to tell you something.

750
01:06:06,797 --> 01:06:08,296
I don't know what it is,

751
01:06:08,298 --> 01:06:10,999
but you better listen.

752
01:06:11,001 --> 01:06:13,668
You're innocent?

753
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:19,074
Guards.

754
01:06:19,076 --> 01:06:20,675
Wait, what am I supposed

755
01:06:20,677 --> 01:06:22,344
to tell Dr. Parrish?

756
01:06:22,346 --> 01:06:23,845
Tell him what he wants
to hear.

757
01:06:23,847 --> 01:06:26,214
Tell him you don't see
the twins anymore.

758
01:06:44,533 --> 01:06:46,501
He doesn't have to stay.

759
01:06:46,503 --> 01:06:49,004
I'm not gonna kill myself.

760
01:06:49,006 --> 01:06:50,839
He's just doing his job.

761
01:06:50,841 --> 01:06:53,708
And we'll be right down the hall
if you need us.

762
01:06:55,745 --> 01:06:58,847
God, I can't believe
Wyatt killed his own kids.

763
01:06:58,849 --> 01:07:02,283
He was a sick man.

764
01:07:02,285 --> 01:07:05,487
Do you have anything
that might help me sleep?

765
01:07:05,489 --> 01:07:07,789
I hate to ask.
It's just been such a long day...

766
01:07:07,791 --> 01:07:10,325
I have just the thing.

767
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:24,072
I guess he's dead now.

768
01:07:26,175 --> 01:07:29,077
Here you go.

769
01:07:29,079 --> 01:07:30,512
You'll sleep for hours.

770
01:07:30,514 --> 01:07:33,181
And I'll let you sleep in.

771
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:41,356
Thank you.

772
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:46,194
For what?

773
01:07:46,196 --> 01:07:51,099
For taking the time to care.

774
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:08,550
Good night, honey.

775
01:12:30,612 --> 01:12:34,148
Both: You're next.

776
01:13:00,776 --> 01:13:02,210
I'm going into town.

777
01:13:02,212 --> 01:13:03,878
Do you want to come?

778
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:06,581
I kind of just want to veg.

779
01:13:19,328 --> 01:13:22,964
It's Robbie.

780
01:13:22,966 --> 01:13:25,967
Are you two friends?

781
01:13:25,969 --> 01:13:28,503
He has a past.

782
01:13:28,505 --> 01:13:31,372
What kind?

783
01:13:31,374 --> 01:13:34,375
The "no means yes" kind.

784
01:13:34,377 --> 01:13:36,944
Um, got it.

785
01:13:36,946 --> 01:13:39,247
I'll be in the living room

786
01:13:39,249 --> 01:13:42,850
if you need me.

787
01:13:45,654 --> 01:13:49,690
- Hello?
- I know you're not crazy.

788
01:13:49,692 --> 01:13:51,993
- How?
- Come with me to silver falls.

789
01:13:51,995 --> 01:13:54,662
I'll show you.
- Show me what?

790
01:13:54,664 --> 01:13:57,698
I can't tell you.
You just have to see it.

791
01:13:57,700 --> 01:13:59,400
Did the other giris like it?

792
01:13:59,402 --> 01:14:03,671
- This is about you, Jordan.
- Right.

793
01:14:03,673 --> 01:14:05,206
Meet me behind your house
in an hour.

794
01:14:05,208 --> 01:14:06,974
But don't tell 'em
I'm picking you up.

795
01:14:06,976 --> 01:14:09,377
- Don't come near me.
- You have to trust me here.

796
01:14:20,222 --> 01:14:22,757
Hey, you okay?

797
01:14:22,759 --> 01:14:24,325
I don't feel right
leaving you here.

798
01:14:24,327 --> 01:14:26,594
I'm fine.

799
01:14:26,596 --> 01:14:30,631
Besides, Kevin's here.

800
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:36,571
Morning.

801
01:14:36,573 --> 01:14:38,873
Did you want to try?

802
01:14:38,875 --> 01:14:41,075
Sure.

803
01:14:42,711 --> 01:14:45,746
If she's gonna let me.

804
01:14:47,583 --> 01:14:52,119
I'll get you a log here.

805
01:14:52,121 --> 01:14:55,423
All right.

806
01:14:55,425 --> 01:14:57,792
You want to do,

807
01:14:57,794 --> 01:14:59,727
you want to put the blade

808
01:14:59,729 --> 01:15:01,729
where you're gonna strike.

809
01:15:01,731 --> 01:15:04,499
Slide this hand
up a little bit.

810
01:15:04,501 --> 01:15:06,200
Raise the ax.

811
01:15:06,202 --> 01:15:08,302
And go for the kill.

812
01:15:08,304 --> 01:15:09,570
Very good.

813
01:15:09,572 --> 01:15:11,105
Want to do it again?

814
01:15:11,107 --> 01:15:13,808
All right.

815
01:15:13,810 --> 01:15:17,311
Let's try this guy.

816
01:15:17,313 --> 01:15:20,548
Okay?

817
01:15:23,051 --> 01:15:25,019
Nice.

818
01:15:27,756 --> 01:15:29,223
Feels good, right?

819
01:15:29,225 --> 01:15:30,424
Yeah.

820
01:15:30,426 --> 01:15:32,126
I just have to catch my breath.

821
01:15:32,128 --> 01:15:34,495
This is a lot of wood.

822
01:15:34,497 --> 01:15:37,231
O'Leary gives us a better deal
if we buy it in bulk.

823
01:15:37,233 --> 01:15:39,500
Sheriff O'Leary?

824
01:15:39,502 --> 01:15:41,269
Yeah.

825
01:15:41,271 --> 01:15:43,604
Everybody buys their wood
from him around here.

826
01:15:43,606 --> 01:15:44,972
It's a little side business.

827
01:15:44,974 --> 01:15:46,641
He says
it's for Robbie's college fund,

828
01:15:46,643 --> 01:15:49,110
but I think it's for bail.

829
01:15:49,112 --> 01:15:51,913
Like father, like son.

830
01:15:51,915 --> 01:15:53,648
He's a good man.

831
01:15:53,650 --> 01:15:56,851
He just lets Robbie...
- Get away with murder?

832
01:15:59,288 --> 01:16:01,222
Better watch what you say.

833
01:16:01,224 --> 01:16:04,725
I thought
you didn't like them.

834
01:16:06,528 --> 01:16:09,697
It's important to keep the law
on your side around here.

835
01:16:09,699 --> 01:16:13,868
To keep an eye on your enemies.

836
01:16:13,870 --> 01:16:15,503
Right.

837
01:16:15,505 --> 01:16:17,705
You want to do another?

838
01:16:20,842 --> 01:16:24,679
I'm gonna go take a break.

839
01:16:24,681 --> 01:16:28,149
Lie down maybe.

840
01:16:55,344 --> 01:16:57,311
Money.

841
01:18:09,317 --> 01:18:14,855
I really wish
you hadn't opened that drawer.

842
01:18:17,292 --> 01:18:20,061
We promised we weren't
gonna do this anymore.

843
01:18:20,063 --> 01:18:24,799
I didn't have a choice.

844
01:18:24,801 --> 01:18:26,333
We stopped.

845
01:18:26,335 --> 01:18:30,438
Do you really want to argue?

846
01:18:36,078 --> 01:18:40,548
She already wrote the note.

847
01:18:40,550 --> 01:18:43,517
It's just another suicide.

848
01:18:43,519 --> 01:18:48,089
You want a new plaything.

849
01:18:48,091 --> 01:18:50,758
Why do you do that?

850
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:52,993
Why do you always make this
about me?

851
01:18:52,995 --> 01:18:56,764
Because, Anne, it usually is.

852
01:18:59,835 --> 01:19:02,803
I wonder if she's still out.

853
01:19:02,805 --> 01:19:05,306
Don't change the subject.

854
01:19:05,308 --> 01:19:07,608
I'm not.

855
01:19:07,610 --> 01:19:10,778
Okay.

856
01:19:10,780 --> 01:19:13,380
We dump her in the lake.

857
01:19:13,382 --> 01:19:15,950
Why would we go to the lake?

858
01:19:15,952 --> 01:19:17,685
We've always gone to the falls.

859
01:19:17,687 --> 01:19:20,087
Stick to the falls.

860
01:19:20,089 --> 01:19:22,323
You talk to me
like I'm a kid.

861
01:19:22,325 --> 01:19:24,959
Oh.

862
01:19:27,028 --> 01:19:30,731
I thought you liked it
when I did that.

863
01:19:30,733 --> 01:19:34,468
Holly, enough with the lights.

864
01:19:37,105 --> 01:19:42,276
So you still talk to her?

865
01:19:42,278 --> 01:19:44,278
Do you see her?

866
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:47,014
- No.
- But you think about her.

867
01:19:47,016 --> 01:19:48,716
You still fantasize about her.

868
01:19:48,718 --> 01:19:50,751
That's why she's still here.

869
01:19:50,753 --> 01:19:52,086
Because you can't let her go.

870
01:19:52,088 --> 01:19:54,421
I let her go a long time ago.

871
01:19:54,423 --> 01:19:56,757
I let them all go.

872
01:19:56,759 --> 01:20:00,227
But you...

873
01:20:17,045 --> 01:20:19,580
I love you.

874
01:20:19,582 --> 01:20:22,883
I love you.

875
01:20:22,885 --> 01:20:27,087
We don't have to do it
right away.

876
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:30,491
Not really my type.

877
01:20:30,493 --> 01:20:33,060
But if you want to...

878
01:20:33,062 --> 01:20:36,263
I'm game.

879
01:20:57,185 --> 01:20:59,453
Larry, she doesn't want
to see you.

880
01:20:59,455 --> 01:21:03,190
Look, I just want
to say I'm sorry.

881
01:21:03,192 --> 01:21:05,159
She's not going
to forgive you.

882
01:21:05,161 --> 01:21:08,529
She's very depressed.

883
01:21:08,531 --> 01:21:10,998
We're worried.

884
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,666
You have
to let me talk to her.

885
01:21:12,668 --> 01:21:16,904
Look, I shouldn't have said
those things in the woods, okay?

886
01:21:16,906 --> 01:21:18,472
And I started it.

887
01:21:18,474 --> 01:21:19,874
I realize that.

888
01:21:19,876 --> 01:21:22,343
But I didn't mean to.

889
01:21:24,446 --> 01:21:26,680
Good night, Larry.

890
01:21:33,755 --> 01:21:35,456
You're not being a gentleman.

891
01:21:35,458 --> 01:21:38,158
I could just talk to her
through the door.

892
01:21:39,928 --> 01:21:40,472
Kevin.

893
01:21:44,967 --> 01:21:48,369
Jordan is upset.

894
01:21:48,371 --> 01:21:50,237
Can I just say it
so she can hear?

895
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:52,039
And then I'll leave.

896
01:21:52,041 --> 01:21:53,574
You guys
were in high school once.

897
01:21:53,576 --> 01:21:56,543
You remember how it is.

898
01:21:58,413 --> 01:22:02,116
Then you'll go
and never come back?

899
01:22:04,386 --> 01:22:05,719
Yeah.

900
01:22:05,721 --> 01:22:07,154
Tell her from there.

901
01:22:07,156 --> 01:22:08,989
Is she in her room?

902
01:22:08,991 --> 01:22:13,661
Mm-hmm.

903
01:22:13,663 --> 01:22:18,132
Jordan!

904
01:22:18,134 --> 01:22:20,801
Jordan, I'm sorry.

905
01:22:20,803 --> 01:22:22,970
I'm really sorry.

906
01:22:22,972 --> 01:22:25,439
So sorry.

907
01:22:25,441 --> 01:22:28,342
You said that.

908
01:22:31,379 --> 01:22:33,347
I didn't mean
to break your trust.

909
01:22:33,349 --> 01:22:37,618
I just didn't want to lose you
like the other giris.

910
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:41,755
I wanted to save you.

911
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:48,963
That's all I wanted to say.

912
01:22:48,965 --> 01:22:52,466
Good night, Larry.

913
01:23:04,679 --> 01:23:09,083
Help.
Help!

914
01:23:12,020 --> 01:23:17,257
Help!
Help!

915
01:23:21,529 --> 01:23:23,263
Help!

916
01:23:23,265 --> 01:23:27,501
Jordan, honey,
nobody can hear you.

917
01:23:33,441 --> 01:23:36,510
Help!

918
01:23:42,317 --> 01:23:44,218
Eggs, bacon, cheese,

919
01:23:44,220 --> 01:23:46,720
toilet paper...
- Vodka.

920
01:23:46,722 --> 01:23:49,556
I want vodka.

921
01:23:49,558 --> 01:23:50,102
Vodka.

922
01:23:54,296 --> 01:23:57,564
It's been so long.

923
01:23:57,566 --> 01:23:58,832
Do we need a tarp?

924
01:23:58,834 --> 01:24:02,036
Garbage bags.

925
01:24:02,038 --> 01:24:05,072
Sleeping pills, bleach.

926
01:24:05,074 --> 01:24:07,541
And gloves.

927
01:24:07,543 --> 01:24:10,477
Plastic gloves.

928
01:24:12,047 --> 01:24:16,850
Do you want a blade?

929
01:24:16,852 --> 01:24:20,054
We'll use the mallet.

930
01:24:20,056 --> 01:24:25,092
Anything else?

931
01:24:25,094 --> 01:24:27,461
Sweetie?

932
01:24:27,463 --> 01:24:27,963
Anne?

933
01:24:33,268 --> 01:24:36,503
Maybe you should go.

934
01:24:39,407 --> 01:24:42,342
No playing till I get home.

935
01:24:46,714 --> 01:24:51,118
Or mommy would be very angry.

936
01:25:42,303 --> 01:25:44,705
It's okay.

937
01:25:44,707 --> 01:25:47,674
It's okay.

938
01:25:47,676 --> 01:25:50,911
Jordan, sweetie,

939
01:25:50,913 --> 01:25:54,081
come on.

940
01:25:54,083 --> 01:25:56,350
Come on out.
Please?

941
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:59,286
Okay, I'm gonna take
these cuffs off.

942
01:25:59,288 --> 01:26:03,090
Come on out.
We have to hurry.

943
01:26:03,092 --> 01:26:05,325
I want to take the cuffs off.
Please.

944
01:26:05,327 --> 01:26:06,660
But we got to hurry.

945
01:26:06,662 --> 01:26:09,229
We got to hurry.
I need you out now.

946
01:26:09,231 --> 01:26:11,098
Please.

947
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:12,399
Come on.

948
01:26:12,401 --> 01:26:13,767
Trust me.
Come on.

949
01:26:13,769 --> 01:26:15,936
Come on.

950
01:26:15,938 --> 01:26:18,405
Listen.
Turn around.

951
01:26:18,407 --> 01:26:22,509
Okay.
Okay.

952
01:26:25,079 --> 01:26:26,680
I got you, baby.

953
01:26:26,682 --> 01:26:28,148
Okay.

954
01:26:28,150 --> 01:26:30,350
Okay, you can go.

955
01:26:30,352 --> 01:26:32,653
Go on.
Go.

956
01:26:32,655 --> 01:26:34,855
You're not gonna kill me?

957
01:26:34,857 --> 01:26:38,258
Anne's out of her mind.
Go.

958
01:26:38,260 --> 01:26:41,662
I said go.

959
01:26:46,434 --> 01:26:49,336
It's locked.

960
01:26:50,438 --> 01:26:53,674
It shouldn't be.

961
01:26:53,676 --> 01:26:56,577
- Well, it is.
- Try harder.

962
01:26:56,579 --> 01:26:58,879
I did.

963
01:27:07,388 --> 01:27:09,756
You said
you were gonna let me go.

964
01:27:09,758 --> 01:27:12,559
I just did.

965
01:27:14,862 --> 01:27:17,864
Come here.

966
01:27:17,866 --> 01:27:19,333
Isn't that better?

967
01:27:19,335 --> 01:27:22,836
See, Anne,
she's all about the pain.

968
01:27:22,838 --> 01:27:27,541
Me, I like pleasure.

969
01:27:30,712 --> 01:27:32,379
Come here, come here.

970
01:27:32,381 --> 01:27:34,881
There you go.

971
01:27:37,418 --> 01:27:39,987
You're okay.
Look.

972
01:27:39,989 --> 01:27:42,256
Jordan, hey,

973
01:27:42,258 --> 01:27:44,324
hey, hey, hey, hey.

974
01:27:44,326 --> 01:27:46,093
Shh, shh, shh.

975
01:27:46,095 --> 01:27:47,594
This is our playtime, okay?

976
01:27:47,596 --> 01:27:50,464
All right, I need you
to do something for me.

977
01:27:50,466 --> 01:27:52,599
I want to play a little game.

978
01:27:52,601 --> 01:27:54,101
I want you
to run up the stairs again,

979
01:27:54,103 --> 01:27:56,970
and when you get to the top,
this time I want you

980
01:27:56,972 --> 01:28:01,041
to look back
like you're gonna miss me.

981
01:28:01,043 --> 01:28:04,344
You killed them.

982
01:28:04,346 --> 01:28:06,380
What?

983
01:28:06,382 --> 01:28:08,282
You killed all of them.

984
01:28:08,284 --> 01:28:11,685
No.

985
01:28:12,921 --> 01:28:15,122
Stupid.
It was Anne.

986
01:28:15,124 --> 01:28:19,192
Why are you doing this to me?

987
01:28:19,194 --> 01:28:23,130
Because she loves me.

988
01:28:23,132 --> 01:28:26,833
She loves me the way I am.

989
01:28:26,835 --> 01:28:30,837
Can you run now?

990
01:28:30,839 --> 01:28:35,375
Please just do
what I'm telling you to do.

991
01:28:35,377 --> 01:28:37,010
All right, okay, hold on.

992
01:28:37,012 --> 01:28:38,979
Hold on.
I don't want to hurt you, okay?

993
01:28:38,981 --> 01:28:40,314
I'm gonna tell you this.

994
01:28:40,316 --> 01:28:43,517
When Annie comes back,
it's gonna hurt real bad.

995
01:28:43,519 --> 01:28:47,988
But I can stop that.

996
01:28:47,990 --> 01:28:50,123
I will give you this pill.

997
01:28:50,125 --> 01:28:53,660
And what this is gonna do,
it's gonna make you feel good.

998
01:28:53,662 --> 01:28:56,063
I don't want this to hurt you.

999
01:28:56,065 --> 01:28:57,998
I'm not about pain.

1000
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,733
But what I need you to do,

1001
01:28:59,735 --> 01:29:03,136
I need you to go up the stairs,
turn around,

1002
01:29:03,138 --> 01:29:06,606
and look at me.

1003
01:29:09,010 --> 01:29:13,046
Go up the stairs.

1004
01:29:14,315 --> 01:29:16,149
Run!

1005
01:29:16,151 --> 01:29:17,684
Run!

1006
01:29:17,686 --> 01:29:20,887
Oh, no, no, no.
Too late.

1007
01:29:20,889 --> 01:29:22,622
Too late.
I gave you a chance.

1008
01:29:22,624 --> 01:29:24,358
I say run.
I say run over there.

1009
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:26,326
And you didn't run.
I said let's play a game,

1010
01:29:26,328 --> 01:29:28,161
go to the top of the stairs,

1011
01:29:28,163 --> 01:29:29,996
turn back
like you're gonna miss me.

1012
01:29:29,998 --> 01:29:33,033
Was that so hard?
You didn't want to listen to me.

1013
01:29:33,035 --> 01:29:34,368
You know what?

1014
01:29:34,370 --> 01:29:36,570
You remind me
so much of your mother.

1015
01:29:36,572 --> 01:29:38,038
She didn't want to listen
to me either.

1016
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:41,208
You're so much
like your mother.

1017
01:29:41,210 --> 01:29:43,210
- My mom?
- Yes, your mom.

1018
01:29:43,212 --> 01:29:45,112
I tried to help her.

1019
01:29:45,114 --> 01:29:46,713
But she wouldn't listen.

1020
01:29:46,715 --> 01:29:48,548
What am I gonna do?

1021
01:29:48,550 --> 01:29:51,351
You're just crazy.
You're all so crazy.

1022
01:29:51,353 --> 01:29:52,853
You killed my mom?

1023
01:29:52,855 --> 01:29:54,888
Annie killed your mother.
Annie killed your mom!

1024
01:29:54,890 --> 01:29:56,590
- You killed my mom?
- Come on.

1025
01:29:56,592 --> 01:30:00,560
- You killed my mom!
- Do it! Come on. Come on.

1026
01:30:00,562 --> 01:30:03,430
You killed my mom!

1027
01:30:03,432 --> 01:30:05,665
You killed...

1028
01:30:05,667 --> 01:30:08,702
you killed my mom!

1029
01:30:11,672 --> 01:30:13,907
- Do it.
Do it.

1030
01:30:36,764 --> 01:30:39,866
What the hell is going on?

1031
01:30:43,838 --> 01:30:47,007
Come on.
We have to go.

1032
01:30:47,009 --> 01:30:49,009
They want something from us.

1033
01:30:49,011 --> 01:30:51,645
Who?

1034
01:30:51,647 --> 01:30:55,482
Jordan, who?

1035
01:31:01,088 --> 01:31:03,790
Jordan.
Jordan.

1036
01:31:03,792 --> 01:31:04,825
Jordan.

1037
01:31:04,827 --> 01:31:07,194
Jordan, come on.
We gotta go.

1038
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:13,733
Jordan.
Jordan...

1039
01:31:13,735 --> 01:31:16,203
get away from my baby.

1040
01:31:32,487 --> 01:31:33,887
They're not gonna let us
leave.

1041
01:31:33,889 --> 01:31:35,856
There's some weird shit
going on here.

1042
01:31:35,858 --> 01:31:40,126
I told you not to play
until I got back.

1043
01:31:56,544 --> 01:32:01,615
You... ooh, this is gonna be
so much fun.

1044
01:32:03,217 --> 01:32:05,519
Hey.

1045
01:32:05,521 --> 01:32:08,188
Leave her alone.

1046
01:32:47,428 --> 01:32:52,098
Welcome to my worid.

1047
01:32:55,002 --> 01:32:59,839
Um, new rule.

1048
01:32:59,841 --> 01:33:02,642
Ghosts can't hurt you
unless you hurt them.

1049
01:33:02,644 --> 01:33:04,578
Um, new rule.

1050
01:33:04,580 --> 01:33:07,781
Shut up.
