179
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,707
- Me?

180
00:09:09,707 --> 00:09:10,960
- Yeah, in the gym.

181
00:09:13,227 --> 00:09:15,607
You were in the stands like

182

183
00:09:18,937 --> 00:09:19,770

185
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:26,727

00:09:26,727 --> 00:09:28,207
- Oh yeah?

187
00:09:28,207 --> 00:09:29,040
- No.

188
00:09:30,867 --> 00:09:34,120
I mean that wasn't me up in the stands.

189
00:09:35,257 --> 00:09:37,340
- Yo Bobby, let's go man.

190
00:09:39,417 --> 00:09:42,790
- So why don't you come by
the gym Monday after practice?

191
00:09:45,277 --> 00:09:48,430
- Oh well, I'm busy but Stac can go.

192
00:09:49,917 --> 00:09:51,370
- Okay, great.

193
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:55,560
Oh.

200
00:10:19,687 --> 00:10:24,307
- I want to see men out
there, aggressive, dominating.

201
00:10:24,307 --> 00:10:28,907
Remember it's not about
strength, it's about control

202
00:10:28,907 --> 00:10:31,057
and how do you get control?

203
00:10:31,057 --> 00:10:32,717
You demoralize your opponent,

204
00:10:32,717 --> 00:10:35,927
catch him off guard, let
him know who's in charge.

205
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:39,237
That's what makes a
champion, you understand?

206
00:10:39,237 --> 00:10:40,137

207
00:10:41,637 --> 00:10:43,560

- Am I too early or should I--

211
00:11:02,557 --> 00:11:05,687

00:11:05,687 --> 00:11:07,957
You can spot me?
- Spot you?

213

It was?

220
00:11:29,717 --> 00:11:32,267
- Most girls, they look at ya

221
00:11:32,267 --> 00:11:33,640
but don't say what they're thinking.

222
00:11:34,751 --> 00:11:35,969
- They don't?

223
00:11:35,969 --> 00:11:37,985
- No, so when somebody's honest

224
00:11:37,985 --> 00:11:40,830

231
00:12:02,817 --> 00:12:04,517
- Well it's not like a date date.

232
00:12:04,517 --> 00:12:06,710
It's more like a group thing.
- Right.

Bobby Tennison does not invite

smart and he's so sweet.

you guys would come too.

he doesn't want us there, it'll be weird.

239
00:12:20,967 --> 00:12:22,827

I promised I wouldn't tell
this so don't say anything

241

379
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,418

380
00:21:05,418 --> 00:21:06,751

382
00:21:10,174 --> 00:21:12,024

383
00:21:13,847 --> 00:21:16,047
ooh, what do we have here?

384
00:21:16,047 --> 00:21:18,807

Stacy, you got that boy whipped.

388

391
00:21:30,827 --> 00:21:32,507

have to, it's the law.

- Not until you write me a poem.

398
00:21:44,377 --> 00:21:46,737
- Bobby, I didn't read it to
'em, we were just having fun.

399
00:21:46,737 --> 00:21:48,532
- Oh, you like making fun of me?

400
00:21:48,532 --> 00:21:49,985
- No, that's not what I meant.

- Hey, what's between
us is nobody's business.

402
00:21:52,627 --> 00:21:54,727
- I wouldn't tell them anything important.

403
00:21:56,009 --> 00:21:58,396
- Well if it's not important to you then--

404
00:21:58,396 --> 00:22:01,313
- No, Bobby, don't do that, Bobby--

405
00:22:10,777 --> 00:22:12,360
- Why'd you have to get me so mad?

406

I hate to see you cry like that.

410

431
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:59,994
- I'll get clothes for
the night, wait here.

432
00:23:59,994 --> 00:24:01,517
- But Bobby, if I cut your hair now,

433
00:24:01,517 --> 00:24:03,487
then you could just get dressed.

434
00:24:03,487 --> 00:24:04,320
Bobby.

435
00:24:05,767 --> 00:24:08,296
It's been two months and I
haven't even met your mom yet.

436
00:24:08,296 --> 00:24:10,046
- And I told you, she sleeps a lot.

437
00:24:22,257 --> 00:24:24,707
- [Mom] Bobby, Bobby.

438
00:24:24,707 --> 00:24:25,540
- [Bobby] What?

439
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,347
- [Mom] I really need your
help in the yard today.

440
00:24:27,347 --> 00:24:28,686
- [Bobby] What do you need my help for?

441
00:24:28,686 --> 00:24:30,567
You're here all day.
- Come on, I really need--

442
00:24:30,567 --> 00:24:31,867
- [Bobby] No, all you do is sit and watch

443
00:24:31,867 --> 00:24:33,567
television ma, can't
you go and do something?

444
00:24:33,567 --> 00:24:36,367
- I want you to help me--
- I've got plans, I gotta go.

445
00:24:41,671 --> 00:24:42,654
- But if there's no reason
I shouldn't meet her--

446
00:24:42,654 --> 00:24:47,057
- The reason is I don't want
you to, now can we drop it?

447
00:24:47,057 --> 00:24:48,777
- Hey, can I be next?

448
00:24:48,777 --> 00:24:51,105
I've been begging her
for weeks to do my hair.

449
00:24:51,105 --> 00:24:52,377
- But your hair looks so good like that.

450
00:24:52,377 --> 00:24:54,339
- You think so?
- Yeah.

451
00:24:54,339 --> 00:24:55,997
- I have to do the color.
- Mom.

452
00:24:55,997 --> 00:24:56,830

453
00:24:57,937 --> 00:24:59,137
Oh.

454
00:24:59,137 --> 00:24:59,970
I'll go change.

455
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,597
- So,

456
00:25:03,597 --> 00:25:05,747
any other rules I should know about?

457
00:25:05,747 --> 00:25:09,080
- Well, I think you should be
home at night when I call you.

458
00:25:10,447 --> 00:25:12,067
- What, are you serious?

459
00:25:12,067 --> 00:25:13,547
- Yeah.

460
00:25:13,547 --> 00:25:15,217
You weren't home last
night, I was worried.

461
00:25:15,217 --> 00:25:17,657
- Yeah but I was studying
with Nicki and some friends.

462
00:25:17,657 --> 00:25:18,967
- [Bobby] What if I wanted to see you?

463
00:25:18,967 --> 00:25:20,617
- Yeah but Bobby, you never said that--

464
00:25:20,617 --> 00:25:21,902
- You shouldn't be going out with big

465
00:25:21,902 --> 00:25:24,337
groups of people when
I'm not around anyway.

466
00:25:24,337 --> 00:25:25,917
- Come on, why not?

467
00:25:25,917 --> 00:25:27,834
- What if some guy hits on you?

468
00:25:28,687 --> 00:25:31,167
How do you think that'll make me feel?

469
00:25:31,167 --> 00:25:34,257
- I know but I always
hang out with my friends.

470
00:25:34,257 --> 00:25:36,017
- I thought we loved each other.

471
00:25:36,017 --> 00:25:36,850
- We do.

472
00:25:37,807 --> 00:25:38,867

473

I don't wanna lose you.

- You want all of me?

477
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:56,037
- I want your lips

478
00:25:58,933 --> 00:26:00,100

00:26:05,366 --> 00:26:06,783

00:28:41,607 --> 00:28:42,440
- What?

529
00:28:43,997 --> 00:28:45,000
What did you say?

530
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,980
- I saw your girlfriend this
morning, she's looking fine.

531
00:28:51,038 --> 00:28:54,871
(anxious violin, piano tones)

532
00:29:12,899 --> 00:29:14,280
- What the hell's wrong with you?

533
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,169
- What, what did I do?

534
00:29:16,169 --> 00:29:17,845
- Look at you, showing
your ass to everybody.

535
00:29:17,845 --> 00:29:19,969
Here, for when the other
guys walk around you.

536
00:29:19,969 --> 00:29:21,657
Is that how much you care about me?

537
00:29:21,657 --> 00:29:22,897
- Bobby no, I wore this for you.

538
00:29:22,897 --> 00:29:24,710
- For me, you look like a slut.

539
00:29:25,767 --> 00:29:27,007
- But you said you loved my legs.

540
00:29:27,007 --> 00:29:28,627
- Do you just like
embarrassing me like this?

541
00:29:28,627 --> 00:29:30,897
- No, Bobby nobody thinks that--

542
00:29:30,897 --> 00:29:32,967
- You just care about what I think.

543
00:29:32,967 --> 00:29:35,390
It's just me because nobody
else cares about you.

544
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,640
Nobody else wants you.

545
00:29:39,915 --> 00:29:41,515
- But I don't want anybody else.

546
00:29:43,102 --> 00:29:46,935
(anxious violin, piano tones)

547
00:29:50,228 --> 00:29:51,827
- Hey Stac, where you going?

548
00:29:51,827 --> 00:29:53,450
Class is over here.

549
00:29:59,087 --> 00:30:01,767
- Bobby, Bobby please don't be mad.

550
00:30:01,767 --> 00:30:03,047
I didn't mean to hurt you.

551
00:30:03,047 --> 00:30:04,977
- You want everybody to
hear you, to see you cry?

552
00:30:04,977 --> 00:30:06,307
You want to embarrass me again?

553
00:30:06,307 --> 00:30:07,787
- No, I didn't want to do anything.

554
00:30:07,787 --> 00:30:11,397
Bobby, I wore this for
you because I love you.

555
00:30:11,397 --> 00:30:13,475
Don't turn around and leave--
- Will you stop?

556
00:30:13,475 --> 00:30:14,308
What are you trying--

557
00:30:16,507 --> 00:30:17,340
Great.

558
00:30:18,827 --> 00:30:19,660
You happy now?

559
00:30:25,397 --> 00:30:26,260
- You all right?

560
00:30:28,667 --> 00:30:30,717
Back to the match guys, come on let's go.

561
00:30:32,067 --> 00:30:35,097
What am I seeing here?
- It's nothing, coach.

562
00:30:35,097 --> 00:30:35,947
It's an accident.

563
00:30:39,297 --> 00:30:40,967
- I slipped.

564
00:30:40,967 --> 00:30:42,620
- But you're okay now, right?

565
00:30:47,831 --> 00:30:50,007
- What's going on, Bobby?

566
00:30:50,007 --> 00:30:51,997
Now you're my best wrestler, if I have to

567
00:30:51,997 --> 00:30:53,837
report this and we lose
you for the County Finals--

568
00:30:53,837 --> 00:30:57,200
- No coach, she just slipped
and fell, that's all, nothing.

569
00:30:59,598 --> 00:31:00,515
- I'm fine.

570
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:02,813
I'm fine.

571
00:31:05,437 --> 00:31:06,617
- Okay.

572
00:31:06,617 --> 00:31:09,277
Okay then but from now on,

573
00:31:09,277 --> 00:31:10,977
you save that spirit for the team.

574
00:31:13,566 --> 00:31:16,749
(whistle blares)

575
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:17,832
- I love you.

576
00:31:27,667 --> 00:31:30,917
(ominous violin tones)

577
00:31:33,001 --> 00:31:34,337
- I rented that movie you wanted to see

578
00:31:34,337 --> 00:31:36,017
but you've been in here for hours.

579
00:31:36,017 --> 00:31:37,990
- Oh yeah, I've been talking to Bobby.

580
00:31:39,517 --> 00:31:41,017
- Getting pretty serious, huh?

581
00:31:42,037 --> 00:31:46,667
- Yeah, he's funny and smart
and he makes me feel protected,

582
00:31:46,667 --> 00:31:48,367
like he'll always be there for me.

583
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,757
- But still, you see
him every day at school

584
00:31:52,757 --> 00:31:54,290
and then you spend every
night talking to him--

585
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:56,837
- He's my boyfriend, we love each other.

586
00:31:56,837 --> 00:31:59,397
- I know and I know he's popular

587
00:31:59,397 --> 00:32:02,280
and fun and he's interested--
- Then what's the problem?

588
00:32:05,537 --> 00:32:09,907
- You have other friends
and you have plans

589
00:32:09,907 --> 00:32:11,837
and to let him control your whole life--

590
00:32:11,837 --> 00:32:15,177
- Mom wait, that is your story, not mine.

591
00:32:15,177 --> 00:32:17,457
What we have together is something real.

592
00:32:17,457 --> 00:32:18,347
- I'm only saying--

593
00:32:18,347 --> 00:32:20,637
- What you're saying is
that because I met someone

594
00:32:20,637 --> 00:32:23,537
great who loves me and just
because of what happened--

595
00:32:23,537 --> 00:32:25,537
- I want to be your friend.

596
00:32:25,537 --> 00:32:27,457
- Then why make such a big deal?

597
00:32:27,457 --> 00:32:29,637
- Because you've always been strong

598
00:32:29,637 --> 00:32:32,177
and independent and I
want you to stay that way.

599
00:32:32,177 --> 00:32:33,977

663
00:35:52,487 --> 00:35:54,157

664
00:35:54,157 --> 00:35:55,833

important thing in the world

670

and I'm not gonna give that up

671
00:36:10,357 --> 00:36:12,257

673
00:36:17,497 --> 00:36:18,330

I'm sorry, Mrs. Tennison.

Come on.

684
00:37:14,567 --> 00:37:16,897

685
00:37:16,897 --> 00:37:17,990
- I'd like to.

686
00:37:18,857 --> 00:37:21,537
- I can see how happy you've made Bobby.

687
00:37:21,537 --> 00:37:24,277
Things haven't been easy for
him since his father left.

688
00:37:24,277 --> 00:37:26,280
I'm sure he's told you all about that.

689
00:37:27,117 --> 00:37:28,407
- No.

690
00:37:28,407 --> 00:37:32,457
Actually not really, you mean
he was close to his father?

691
00:37:32,457 --> 00:37:34,567
- Bobby's always missed
him but of course he

692
00:37:34,567 --> 00:37:37,457
wouldn't come right out and
say it but sometimes when he--

693
00:37:37,457 --> 00:37:38,807
- Get out of the truck.

694
00:37:38,807 --> 00:37:40,707
- [Stacy] Oh Bobby, it's
okay, I was shopping here--

695
00:37:40,707 --> 00:37:41,990
- Get out of the truck.
- Bobby.

696
00:37:44,826 --> 00:37:46,079
- Come on.
- Will you stop?

697
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:47,917
I didn't do anything.

698
00:37:47,917 --> 00:37:49,630
Bobby you're hurting me, Bobby.

699
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:53,787
- I said stay away from her, didn't I?

700
00:37:53,787 --> 00:37:54,798
- But your mom--

701
00:37:54,798 --> 00:37:56,087
- It doesn't matter what she thinks.

702
00:37:56,087 --> 00:37:57,397
It's me you're supposed to care about.

703
00:37:57,397 --> 00:37:59,041
- Bobby I do, I love you.

704
00:37:59,041 --> 00:38:00,987
- No, you say you love me and
then you go behind my back.

705
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:02,477
- No.

706
00:38:02,477 --> 00:38:03,917
Bobby, why is it that every time

707
00:38:03,917 --> 00:38:05,660
I say or do something, it's wrong?

708
00:38:07,009 --> 00:38:08,674
Bobby, will you wait?

709
00:38:08,674 --> 00:38:10,837
You never just talk to me anymore.

710
00:38:10,837 --> 00:38:12,777
- Get out of the way.
- This is crazy.

711
00:38:12,777 --> 00:38:15,660
We never just talk anymore,
Bobby don't, Bobby.

712
00:38:17,514 --> 00:38:22,079
Bobby, will you listen to me
please, will you talk to me?

713
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:25,768
(tires screeching)

714
00:38:25,768 --> 00:38:28,584
Fine then just stay away
from me okay, just stay away!

715
00:38:31,681 --> 00:38:35,514
(anxious violin, piano tones)

716
00:38:39,457 --> 00:38:42,087
- Stacy, is that you?
- Uh-huh.

717
00:38:42,087 --> 00:38:44,267
- I just got home from
work, Rod's on his way over.

718
00:38:44,267 --> 00:38:46,367
There's some sandwich stuff in the fridge.

719
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:16,413
(soft piano, violin tones)

720
00:39:17,705 --> 00:39:20,372
- We have a reservation at five.

721
00:39:21,937 --> 00:39:23,940
Here, let me, go eat your sandwich.

722
00:39:26,987 --> 00:39:28,393
Remember when I used to make it

723
00:39:28,393 --> 00:39:30,057
for you in the big yellow mug?

724
00:39:30,057 --> 00:39:32,457
You said that's how it tasted best.

725
00:39:32,457 --> 00:39:34,107
Whatever happened to those years?

726
00:39:35,277 --> 00:39:38,610
Then before you know it, it
all changes and you and I,

727
00:39:40,527 --> 00:39:41,820
Stacy what happened?

728
00:39:43,057 --> 00:39:44,757
- Bobby and I were goofing around.

729
00:39:47,879 --> 00:39:50,380
- That's a big bruise for goofing around.

730
00:39:54,957 --> 00:39:56,327
You know I had that meeting Monday

731
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:58,897
with Mrs. Cole about your grades

732
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:00,567
and I told her that we talked

733
00:40:01,987 --> 00:40:05,970
and that you hadn't mentioned
that there were any problems.

734
00:40:07,074 --> 00:40:09,991
(car horn honking)

735
00:40:11,577 --> 00:40:12,410
That's Rod.

736
00:40:15,407 --> 00:40:16,240
I better go.

737
00:40:19,397 --> 00:40:21,737
- You want to talk about problems?

738
00:40:21,737 --> 00:40:23,677
Let's start with yours,
let's talk about Rod.

739
00:40:23,677 --> 00:40:24,574
- Stacy please--

740
00:40:24,574 --> 00:40:26,527
- And the crappy way he treats you

741
00:40:26,527 --> 00:40:28,457
but of course you never see a thing.

742
00:40:28,457 --> 00:40:31,337
- I swear I don't know
what's with you anymore.

743
00:40:31,337 --> 00:40:33,559
You're either out with Bobby
or moping in your room--

744
00:40:33,559 --> 00:40:35,797
- But you let him control your whole life.

745
00:40:35,797 --> 00:40:37,647
At least I have someone who loves me.

746
00:40:40,627 --> 00:40:42,027
- You said you'd be outside.

747
00:40:44,007 --> 00:40:47,997
- Stacy please, we've always been friends.

748
00:40:47,997 --> 00:40:50,517
- Maybe I don't want you to be my friend.

749
00:40:50,517 --> 00:40:52,200
Maybe I want you to be my mother.

750
00:40:55,337 --> 00:40:56,170
- She's 16.

751
00:40:57,067 --> 00:40:58,177
Okay?

752
00:40:58,177 --> 00:40:59,627
Come on, we're gonna be late.

753
00:41:00,837 --> 00:41:02,030
Laura, let's go.

754
00:41:07,057 --> 00:41:08,691
- [Stacy] Oh my god.

755
00:41:08,691 --> 00:41:10,217
What are you doing in
here, how'd you get here?

756
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:11,184
- I had to see you.

757
00:41:12,527 --> 00:41:15,937
Stacy, I swear--
- No, I want you out now.

758
00:41:15,937 --> 00:41:17,760
- I don't blame you for hating me.

759
00:41:18,797 --> 00:41:22,847
But if we're going to break
up I just, let me explain.

760
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:24,707
- What do you mean, explain what?

761
00:41:24,707 --> 00:41:25,607
- About my family.

762
00:41:28,192 --> 00:41:29,930
I didn't want you to know.

763
00:41:33,807 --> 00:41:34,640
See,

764
00:41:37,397 --> 00:41:39,720
my dad's a drunk, all right?

765
00:41:40,927 --> 00:41:41,827
And he'd come home

766
00:41:43,357 --> 00:41:44,190
yelling.

767
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:48,797
Almost every night, he'd
find something wrong,

768
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:52,607
some dirty dish or some stupid thing

769
00:41:52,607 --> 00:41:55,097
my mother would say and he'd beat her.

770
00:41:55,097 --> 00:41:57,100
I'd lie down and I'd listen to her cry.

771
00:41:59,248 --> 00:42:00,767
There was nothing I could do,

772
00:42:00,767 --> 00:42:02,467
but she'd never leave the bastard.

773
00:42:04,197 --> 00:42:06,067
Then she started drinking and then

774
00:42:06,067 --> 00:42:09,310
everything got so out of control.

775
00:42:10,727 --> 00:42:13,277
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Because that's not us.

776
00:42:16,827 --> 00:42:17,660
Don't you see?

777
00:42:19,987 --> 00:42:23,394
We're different, what we have
is so much better than that.

778
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,227
When I think about losing you...

779
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:41,157
If only my family weren't so screwed up.

780
00:42:41,157 --> 00:42:42,007
- Yeah, mine too.

781
00:42:44,505 --> 00:42:48,107
It's like my mom is
jealous of what we have.

782
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:49,617
She doesn't understand anything.

783
00:42:49,617 --> 00:42:50,450
- No one can.

784
00:42:53,434 --> 00:42:55,534
That's why we gotta stick together because

785
00:42:57,527 --> 00:42:58,690
when you love somebody,

786
00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:02,840
you never give up on 'em.

787
00:43:05,669 --> 00:43:08,034
- Don't worry about me, I'm not giving up.

788
00:43:15,894 --> 00:43:17,344

846

- Stacy, he hit you.

bleeding, let's go inside.

850

851
00:47:21,097 --> 00:47:22,467
He treats you like crap.

852
00:47:22,467 --> 00:47:24,767
- Well you don't know
what he's been through.

853
00:47:24,767 --> 00:47:27,117
Besides, you don't give
up on someone you love.

854
00:47:29,227 --> 00:47:31,209
- You call that love?

855
00:47:31,209 --> 00:47:32,907
I don't even think he likes you.

856
00:47:32,907 --> 00:47:34,907
- Well then you don't know what love is.

857
00:47:38,615 --> 00:47:41,532

860

- [Laura] Just grow up Rod.

861
00:48:08,547 --> 00:48:11,259
- [Rod] I'm fed up with
this, I've had it with you.

862
00:48:11,259 --> 00:48:12,618
- Then just go.
- You push me,

863
00:48:12,618 --> 00:48:15,697
you push me, you push me!
- Well you're free to go, Rod.

864
00:48:15,697 --> 00:48:17,827
- Tell Stacy to come say
hello after she's done.

865
00:48:17,827 --> 00:48:20,027
We've got some catching up to do.

866
00:48:20,027 --> 00:48:22,415
- I think she's pretty tired, mom.

867
00:48:22,415 --> 00:48:24,200
- Is everything all right?

868
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:26,757
- A fight with her boyfriend I guess.

869
00:48:26,757 --> 00:48:27,997
- Oh.

870
00:48:27,997 --> 00:48:29,487
I remember some of those,

871
00:48:29,487 --> 00:48:31,287
all that life and death stuff right?

(relaxed ensemble music)

873
00:49:29,902 --> 00:49:32,597
- You gotta tell your
mom, we'll do it together.

874
00:49:32,597 --> 00:49:35,187
Maybe if I just--
- No, you can't.

875
00:49:35,187 --> 00:49:37,827
He said he was sorry, he wants to change.

876
00:49:37,827 --> 00:49:39,597
- But he won't and you know that.

877
00:49:39,597 --> 00:49:43,077
- Yeah but if I could just--
- Stacy, would you stop it?

878
00:49:43,077 --> 00:49:44,787
You keep acting like this is your fault.

879
00:49:44,787 --> 00:49:46,460
Can't you see that it's his?

880
00:49:50,077 --> 00:49:52,717
You know what's the hardest thing of all?

881
00:49:52,717 --> 00:49:55,217
When you've been friends
with somebody for so long

882
00:49:56,067 --> 00:49:58,317
and you think that it'll
be that way forever.

883
00:49:59,877 --> 00:50:03,167
- Things were so good.
(telephone rings)

884
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:04,000
- Hello.

885
00:50:05,577 --> 00:50:06,410
How did,

886
00:50:07,247 --> 00:50:09,117
no she can't.

887
00:50:09,117 --> 00:50:10,630
Because she's sleeping.

888
00:50:11,537 --> 00:50:13,717
No, you cannot come over.

889
00:50:13,717 --> 00:50:14,610
I gotta go.

890
00:50:16,637 --> 00:50:18,690
- It's like he always knows where I am,

891
00:50:19,667 --> 00:50:21,450
who I'm with, what I'm doing.

892
00:50:23,727 --> 00:50:25,847
God, if I could just get away.

893
00:50:25,847 --> 00:50:29,257
- Stac, listen to me,
everything's gonna be okay.

894
00:50:29,257 --> 00:50:32,667
You'll talk to him this week,
you'll tell him it's over.

895
00:50:32,667 --> 00:50:35,907
Kim, she has this birthday
party on Saturday night.

896
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:38,087
Bobby won't be there, we'll celebrate.

897
00:50:38,087 --> 00:50:40,300
You, me and Val just like the old times.

898
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:46,340
This is my fault too,
I pushed you into this.

899
00:50:47,637 --> 00:50:49,965
But Saturday it'll be all over.

900
00:50:49,965 --> 00:50:51,747
(telephone rings)

901
00:50:51,747 --> 00:50:52,580
What?

902
00:50:54,117 --> 00:50:55,907
Oh, hi Ms. Collins.

903
00:50:55,907 --> 00:50:57,457
Yeah hold on, she's right here.

904
00:51:01,177 --> 00:51:02,467
- Hi mom.

905
00:51:02,467 --> 00:51:04,007
- Honey, I know it's late but I just

906
00:51:04,007 --> 00:51:06,057
had to tell you tonight about me and Rod.

907
00:51:07,697 --> 00:51:09,340
I finally took your advice.

908
00:51:10,327 --> 00:51:12,146
- You mean you ended it?

909
00:51:12,146 --> 00:51:13,506
- Yeah.

910
00:51:13,506 --> 00:51:14,830
I was really scared.

911
00:51:16,057 --> 00:51:17,497
But you should've seen the expression

912
00:51:17,497 --> 00:51:20,810
on his face when I really
stood up for myself.

913
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:24,530
- That's great mom, I can't,

914
00:51:25,834 --> 00:51:28,187
I'm really proud of you.

915
00:51:28,187 --> 00:51:30,587
- I should've taken your
advice a long time ago.

916
00:51:31,627 --> 00:51:34,560
I really love you, honey.
- I love you.

917
00:51:35,817 --> 00:51:36,650
Okay bye.

918
00:51:38,097 --> 00:51:39,060
- She dumped him?

919
00:51:45,047 --> 00:51:46,430
Saturday night, okay?

920
00:51:47,267 --> 00:51:48,987
- [Bobby] Come on Stacy,
I said I was sorry.

921
00:51:48,987 --> 00:51:51,287
- I know and I know that you care about me

922
00:51:51,287 --> 00:51:53,537
but it's not just what
happened at the dance.

923
00:51:54,887 --> 00:51:58,537
- Look, we'll take a drive
and talk it over, I promise--

924
00:51:58,537 --> 00:52:02,120
- Bobby I mean it, we have
to stop seeing each other.

925
00:52:02,977 --> 00:52:04,867
- Wait a minute--
- Look.

926
00:52:04,867 --> 00:52:06,370
I need to be alone, okay?

927
00:52:07,687 --> 00:52:11,397
My life is so messed up, I
don't talk to any of my friends.

928
00:52:11,397 --> 00:52:15,951
I'm behind in all my classes,
I just want my life back.

929
00:52:15,951 --> 00:52:17,001
- But you're my life.

930
00:52:24,437 --> 00:52:25,270
- Look,

931
00:52:26,797 --> 00:52:28,330
I still want to be friends.

932
00:52:32,917 --> 00:52:34,317

She's probably crushed that
Bobby's not here tonight.

945
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:33,767
- Tony said they broke up.

00:53:33,767 --> 00:53:36,974
- Oh yeah, like we believe that.

947
00:53:36,974 --> 00:53:38,570
- It was a good try.

948

- Yes you should.

950
00:53:43,317 --> 00:53:45,297
- I just keep seeing his face everywhere

951
00:53:45,297 --> 00:53:48,527
and he looked so sad.
- We are not

952
00:53:48,527 --> 00:53:52,357
discussing that tonight.
- I know, I know.

953
00:53:52,357 --> 00:53:54,807
It's just that everything's
so tied into Bobby.

954

How can I just--
- Nicki, you're next.

955

- It's just,

956
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:02,100
it's the first week.

957
00:54:03,375 --> 00:54:06,225
- I know, I just wish I could
go away somewhere you know?

958
00:54:07,187 --> 00:54:08,407
It's so hard.

959
00:54:08,407 --> 00:54:12,287
- You know what Stac, it's
a party and I think if

960
00:54:12,287 --> 00:54:16,397
you're gonna talk about Bobby,
I think you should leave.

961
00:54:22,427 --> 00:54:24,687
- This party blows but I've got my car.

962
00:54:24,687 --> 00:54:25,807
Do you want me to come over?

963
00:54:25,807 --> 00:54:27,517
We can watch that show you like.

964
00:54:27,517 --> 00:54:28,800

966
00:54:34,017 --> 00:54:35,067
Yeah, who's she with?

967
00:54:35,917 --> 00:54:37,067
A guy?

968
00:54:37,067 --> 00:54:38,967
- Maybe, I don't know.

969
00:54:38,967 --> 00:54:40,970
Hey, do you wanna try out that new place?

970
00:54:42,157 --> 00:54:43,937
- Come on Carla, let me talk to Stacy.

971
00:54:43,937 --> 00:54:45,927
- Yeah okay, hold on.

972
00:54:45,927 --> 00:54:47,590
Hey Stacy, it's for you.

973
00:54:48,594 --> 00:54:49,744
- It's for me?
- Yeah.

974
00:54:51,017 --> 00:54:51,850
- Hello?

975
00:54:53,107 --> 00:54:54,647
- Hey Stac.

976
00:54:54,647 --> 00:54:55,480
- Bobby.

977
00:54:56,577 --> 00:55:00,457
No I quit, yeah I turned in my shoes.

980
00:55:06,337 --> 00:55:09,480
Stacy, I know it was my fault.

981
00:55:10,337 --> 00:55:13,907
I just, I hope you meant it
that we can still be friends.

982
00:55:13,907 --> 00:55:15,120
- Yeah, I want to.

983
00:55:16,307 --> 00:55:17,357

- Yeah.

987
00:55:27,829 --> 00:55:31,510
I was just thinking about
that haircut you promised.

988
00:55:32,427 --> 00:55:36,597
Because if you're done there
and you want to come over--

989
00:55:36,597 --> 00:55:38,650
- Come over to your house?
- Yeah.

00:55:42,587 --> 00:55:45,350

- Hello?

1063
01:00:19,567 --> 01:00:22,863
- [Laura] Nicki it's Ms.
Collins, can I speak to Stacy?

1064
01:00:22,863 --> 01:00:25,517
- No why, isn't she there?

1065
01:00:25,517 --> 01:00:27,460
- You mean she didn't
stay over last night?

1066
01:00:29,367 --> 01:00:31,987
- Wait a second, you mean she
never came home last night?

1067
01:00:31,987 --> 01:00:33,457
- No

1068
01:00:33,457 --> 01:00:34,797
and Bobby just called and said that

1069
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:38,900
they argued last night and she walked off.

1070
01:00:40,037 --> 01:00:43,387
- Okay don't worry, I'll
find her, I'll go right now.

1071
01:00:43,387 --> 01:00:44,220
- I mean

1072
01:00:45,717 --> 01:00:46,667
where would she go?

1073
01:01:00,457 --> 01:01:02,200
- Where's Stacy?
- She's not here.

1074
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:03,200
I looked everywhere.

1075
01:01:05,767 --> 01:01:06,600
I'm sorry.

1076
01:01:08,706 --> 01:01:10,056
I'm sorry about everything.

1077
01:01:13,113 --> 01:01:15,250
- [Nicki] What happened last night?

1078
01:01:17,907 --> 01:01:18,740
- She,

1079
01:01:19,977 --> 01:01:22,467
she came over and gave me a haircut, then

1080
01:01:23,857 --> 01:01:26,487
we had a fight, she started crying

1081
01:01:28,737 --> 01:01:30,477
about going away

1082
01:01:30,477 --> 01:01:31,897
and

1083
01:01:31,897 --> 01:01:35,450
being alone and then she took off.

1084
01:01:39,057 --> 01:01:40,347
We've gotta find her.

1085
01:01:40,347 --> 01:01:42,237
- We'll find her, she's probably

1086
01:01:42,237 --> 01:01:44,737
just at like the mall or
maybe a restaurant downtown.

1087
01:01:44,737 --> 01:01:46,137
We should check with her mom, though.

1088
01:01:46,137 --> 01:01:48,910
- It's my fault, I just
wanted to talk to her.

1089
01:01:51,627 --> 01:01:52,610
I'm so sorry.

1090
01:01:53,481 --> 01:01:54,831
- Well when she comes back,

1091
01:01:55,767 --> 01:01:57,017
you oughta remember that.

1092
01:01:59,481 --> 01:02:02,731
(anxious violin tones)

1093
01:02:07,121 --> 01:02:09,637
- Then I searched those
shelters out by the golf course.

1094
01:02:09,637 --> 01:02:10,470
Wait,

1095
01:02:11,417 --> 01:02:15,947
she mentioned some family
with a beach house.

1096
01:02:15,947 --> 01:02:18,050
- Yeah the DeAngelos, I called.

1097
01:02:19,657 --> 01:02:20,900
I called everyone.

1098
01:02:22,567 --> 01:02:25,117
The police told me to wait for 24 hours.

1099
01:02:25,117 --> 01:02:27,020
- What about family out of town?

1100
01:02:28,057 --> 01:02:32,481
Maybe she took a bus.
- No.

1101
01:02:32,481 --> 01:02:36,820
I don't know, she's never done
anything like this before.

1102
01:02:39,157 --> 01:02:41,080
- I just hope she doesn't catch a ride.

1103
01:02:44,391 --> 01:02:47,808
(anxious ensemble music)

1104
01:02:49,407 --> 01:02:52,370
I'll get everyone to help,
we'll have her home tonight.

1105
01:02:56,107 --> 01:02:58,109
- [Anderson] Does she drink, do drugs?

1106
01:02:58,109 --> 01:03:00,643
Ever talk of suicide?
- No, not Stacy, never.

1107
01:03:00,643 --> 01:03:01,847
- You said she's been angry.

1108
01:03:01,847 --> 01:03:04,657
- Well not angry, I mean we get along.

1109
01:03:04,657 --> 01:03:06,160
- [Anderson] Any arguments lately?

1110
01:03:07,667 --> 01:03:08,867
- Little ones, you know.

1111
01:03:09,897 --> 01:03:12,787
I guess after 10 hours of
work, you don't always--

1112
01:03:12,787 --> 01:03:15,587
- Then she'd run off?
- No.

1113
01:03:15,587 --> 01:03:18,077
She's never done anything
like this before.

1114
01:03:18,077 --> 01:03:20,927
- Did you talk to her before the party?

1115
01:03:20,927 --> 01:03:23,750
- I called yesterday
morning, she wasn't there.

1116
01:03:27,747 --> 01:03:29,997
She's been staying with
her girlfriend Nicki.

1117
01:03:31,717 --> 01:03:35,420
- What about the boyfriend,
this Bobby Tennison?

1118
01:03:36,378 --> 01:03:37,927
- What about him?
- I don't know.

1119
01:03:37,927 --> 01:03:40,230
They have a good
relationship, are they happy?

1120
01:03:41,297 --> 01:03:43,147
- They're always together.

1121
01:03:43,147 --> 01:03:44,497
- Lots of emotions, fights?

1122
01:03:46,087 --> 01:03:46,920
- No.

1123
01:03:48,397 --> 01:03:49,230
They get along.

1124
01:03:50,197 --> 01:03:51,310
She's a good kid.

1125
01:03:52,407 --> 01:03:55,057
It's just that I don't know
where she is, that's all.

1126
01:03:57,942 --> 01:04:00,942
(school bell rings)

1127
01:04:06,967 --> 01:04:09,357
- Bobby called the whole team
and he told me he went out

1128
01:04:09,357 --> 01:04:12,777
to the golf course last night
and searched with flashlights.

1129
01:04:12,777 --> 01:04:14,567
- I bet she's staying
in a motel somewhere.

1130
01:04:14,567 --> 01:04:15,727
- So you think she ran away?

1131
01:04:15,727 --> 01:04:17,254
- What is that supposed to mean?

1132
01:04:17,254 --> 01:04:19,287
I mean we know she ran away.

1133
01:04:19,287 --> 01:04:20,277
- [Friend] Bobby said she seemed pretty

1134
01:04:20,277 --> 01:04:22,530
stressed out but he thinks
she'll be back soon.

1135
01:04:23,707 --> 01:04:25,650
Hey Ton, crazy night huh?

1136
01:04:28,467 --> 01:04:32,027
- Hey Nick, there's a cop downstairs

1137
01:04:33,387 --> 01:04:35,344
talking to Bobby and Carla.

1138
01:04:37,773 --> 01:04:41,606

1139
01:05:13,014 --> 01:05:14,927
- [Reporter] The
investigation into the weekend

1140
01:05:14,927 --> 01:05:17,797
disappearance of a local
high school girl intensifies.

1141
01:05:17,797 --> 01:05:19,727
16 year old Stacy Collins may have left

1142
01:05:19,727 --> 01:05:22,157
the area after a dispute with a classmate

1143
01:05:22,157 --> 01:05:23,677
but sources now say they're looking into

1144
01:05:23,677 --> 01:05:25,977
a similar incident last June when a girl

1145
01:05:25,977 --> 01:05:29,484
seen hitchhiking on route 97
was later found with her--

1146
01:05:32,612 --> 01:05:36,362
(somber violin, piano music)

1147
01:05:49,458 --> 01:05:54,458
(doorbell buzzes)
(light knocking)

1148
01:05:55,337 --> 01:05:57,687
- Mrs. Tennison?
- Yes.

1149
01:05:57,687 --> 01:05:59,764
- I'm Laura Collins, Stacy's mom.

1150
01:05:59,764 --> 01:06:02,020
- Did she come back?
- No, she didn't.

1151
01:06:03,837 --> 01:06:05,037
I need to talk to Bobby.

1152
01:06:15,297 --> 01:06:17,911
- He's down the hall to the left.

1153
01:06:17,911 --> 01:06:18,911
- Thank you.

1154
01:06:22,807 --> 01:06:26,497
Three days without even a
call, does that make sense?

1155
01:06:26,497 --> 01:06:28,530
- We just gotta hope we hear something.

1156
01:06:31,552 --> 01:06:33,537
- [Laura] You were the
last one to see her.

1157
01:06:33,537 --> 01:06:36,917
Don't lie to me, something
must have happened.

1158
01:06:36,917 --> 01:06:38,067
- I told you the truth.

1159
01:06:40,687 --> 01:06:43,147
- To run off like that alone in the dark

1160
01:06:44,442 --> 01:06:46,267
and you didn't try to stop her?

1161
01:06:46,267 --> 01:06:49,407
- I thought she'd call you or Nicki.

1162
01:06:49,407 --> 01:06:51,720

We all saw that

1186
01:08:13,667 --> 01:08:16,690
and we all know that he
could've done something worse.

1187
01:08:20,067 --> 01:08:22,717
- She's right, when I
saw him at the police

1188
01:08:22,717 --> 01:08:25,507
station yesterday, he
had this look in his eye.

1189
01:08:29,547 --> 01:08:30,647
I swear we're

1190
01:08:31,737 --> 01:08:32,977
closer than brothers

1191
01:08:36,177 --> 01:08:38,220
and it's like I don't know him anymore.

1192
01:08:38,220 --> 01:08:40,140
- It's like that night at the dance,

1193
01:08:41,157 --> 01:08:43,337
he hit her in front of everybody.

1194
01:08:43,337 --> 01:08:45,137
- He didn't even care if people saw.

1195
01:08:46,187 --> 01:08:48,567
- All week he's totally calm.

1196
01:08:48,567 --> 01:08:50,700
He's not even worried that Stacy's gone.

1197
01:08:51,717 --> 01:08:54,417
- It's 'cause he thinks he
can get away with anything.

1198
01:08:55,997 --> 01:08:56,997
- Is everybody done?

1199
01:08:58,297 --> 01:09:00,647
Because I've got something to say.

1200
01:09:00,647 --> 01:09:04,177
Bobby's always been there for
you, always stood up for you.

1201
01:09:04,177 --> 01:09:06,867
Now you can't wait to turn against him.

1202
01:09:06,867 --> 01:09:08,727
Well I'm not gonna listen.

1203
01:09:08,727 --> 01:09:11,318
- Carla, what happened that night?

1204
01:09:11,318 --> 01:09:13,250
Did you see them fight?

1205
01:09:14,247 --> 01:09:15,880
- It was none of my business.

1206
01:09:17,957 --> 01:09:20,147
- Well did you see her run out,

1207
01:09:20,147 --> 01:09:21,850
did you even try to stop her?

1208
01:09:22,877 --> 01:09:24,750
Carla, what happened to Stacy?

1209
01:09:26,127 --> 01:09:29,627
- They argued and she ran
out and that's all I know.

1210
01:09:29,627 --> 01:09:31,237
- Well I think you're lying.

1211
01:09:31,237 --> 01:09:33,117
- Then you can go to hell.

1212
01:09:33,117 --> 01:09:35,407
You were nobody until
Bobby made you his friend.

1213
01:09:35,407 --> 01:09:38,730
- You know what, this is not
some stupid test about loyalty!

1214
01:09:40,467 --> 01:09:42,160
If Stacy is hurt,

1215
01:09:44,587 --> 01:09:46,412
you owe her that much.

1216
01:09:46,412 --> 01:09:48,197
- I told you what I know

1217
01:09:50,687 --> 01:09:53,087
and from now on, you can
just stay away from me.

1218
01:09:54,338 --> 01:09:57,505
(somber violin music)

1219
01:09:58,806 --> 01:10:02,237
- We'll just tell 'em what we know, right?

1220
01:10:02,237 --> 01:10:04,540
Whatever happened to Stacy,
that's all we can do.

1221
01:10:09,717 --> 01:10:13,550
(dramatic mid tempo drumbeat)

1222
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:23,910
- Get over, yeah!

1223
01:10:23,910 --> 01:10:24,743
Yeah.

1224
01:10:26,194 --> 01:10:28,944
(crowd cheering)

1225
01:10:34,913 --> 01:10:38,580
- [Crowd] Bobby, Bobby,
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby!

1226
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:49,730
(whistle blares)

1227
01:10:54,199 --> 01:10:57,282
(classic rock tones)

1228
01:10:59,063 --> 01:11:02,146
(electronic beeping)

1229
01:11:04,977 --> 01:11:05,977
- So what's he like?

1230
01:11:06,879 --> 01:11:08,610
I know you're hanging out together.

1231
01:11:08,610 --> 01:11:11,807
Is he just a tough guy,
is he a big drinker?

1232
01:11:11,807 --> 01:11:13,560
Does he act wild?

1233
01:11:14,583 --> 01:11:17,416
(telephone rings)

1234
01:11:19,047 --> 01:11:20,209
Yeah?

1235
01:11:20,209 --> 01:11:21,404
- [Woman] A man on the line with

1236
01:11:21,404 --> 01:11:23,304
some information on the
missing Collins girl.

1237
01:11:23,304 --> 01:11:25,100
- Yeah okay, put him through.
- Yes sir.

1238
01:11:26,997 --> 01:11:29,987
- Yeah, yeah this is Anderson,
you got some information?

1239
01:11:29,987 --> 01:11:30,820
- [Vince] Yeah.

1240
01:11:32,107 --> 01:11:32,940
Just

1241
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:35,140
go look out by the lake.

1242
01:11:36,617 --> 01:11:39,227
- Okay and a number
where you can be reached?

1243
01:11:39,227 --> 01:11:40,777
- [Vince] Just go look
out by the lake, okay?

1244
01:11:40,777 --> 01:11:45,777
- Yeah I will but just in
case I need to get in touch.

1245
01:11:47,628 --> 01:11:51,378
(anxious violin, rock tones)

1246
01:12:02,792 --> 01:12:06,459
- [Officer] What about
that hill over there?

1247
01:12:11,604 --> 01:12:15,437
- [Officer] Park back
on the green line there.

1248
01:12:25,867 --> 01:12:26,927
- Gentlemen, why don't you roam around

1249
01:12:26,927 --> 01:12:29,110
in that scrub and see
what you can come up with?

1250
01:12:31,767 --> 01:12:35,577
Officers, there's a cove on
the other side of the beach.

1251
01:12:35,577 --> 01:12:39,014
Why don't you make your way
there, see what you can see?

1252
01:12:41,411 --> 01:12:44,828
(anxious ensemble music)

1253
01:13:46,890 --> 01:13:49,140
(knocking)

1254
01:13:53,917 --> 01:13:55,107
- Nicki.

1255
01:13:55,107 --> 01:13:56,890
- There's something I need to tell you.

1256
01:14:14,227 --> 01:14:17,003
- I can understand if
your daughter's afraid.

1257
01:14:17,003 --> 01:14:17,877
But as long as she's cooperates with

1258
01:14:17,877 --> 01:14:20,210
us now, you have nothing to worry about.

1259
01:14:30,872 --> 01:14:31,872
Ms. Collins.

1260
01:14:33,084 --> 01:14:34,984
Do you know a boy named Vince Fortner?

1261
01:14:36,187 --> 01:14:37,947
- [Nicki] Yeah Bobby's friend, why?

1262
01:14:37,947 --> 01:14:40,180
- Well apparently he was
with Bobby on Saturday night.

1263
01:14:40,180 --> 01:14:42,680
When Stacy ran out, Vince went after her.

1264
01:14:43,747 --> 01:14:47,854
We're looking for him now,
why don't you come in?

1265
01:14:49,997 --> 01:14:52,717
- If only she hadn't come back.

1266
01:14:52,717 --> 01:14:55,860
I told her to break it off, to stay away.

1267
01:14:58,827 --> 01:15:00,427
- But she wouldn't listen.

1268
01:15:00,427 --> 01:15:01,820
- She defended him.

1269
01:15:03,057 --> 01:15:06,967
Once she told me that if she
just learned to love him better

1270
01:15:06,967 --> 01:15:10,607
and didn't give up, then he
would treat her better too.

1271
01:15:10,607 --> 01:15:13,480
- I saw bruises but she
told me they were nothing.

1272
01:15:15,307 --> 01:15:18,267
- There was like this wall

1273
01:15:18,267 --> 01:15:21,827
that you just could not break through and

1274
01:15:23,887 --> 01:15:27,556
you'd never think something
could happen, you know?

1275
01:15:27,556 --> 01:15:30,473
(officer knocking)

1276
01:15:36,877 --> 01:15:38,094
- Excuse me please.

1277
01:15:40,247 --> 01:15:42,147
- One night she came home really late.

1278
01:15:43,277 --> 01:15:44,770
She was freezing cold.

1279
01:15:47,677 --> 01:15:49,790
She looked so sad all bundled up.

1280
01:15:51,387 --> 01:15:54,337
I asked her what was wrong and
she said they'd had a fight.

1281
01:15:55,468 --> 01:15:56,760
I could've stopped it then.

1282
01:16:00,718 --> 01:16:03,578
Why didn't I see it then?

1283
01:16:03,578 --> 01:16:04,497
- [Vince] All right, all right.

1284
01:16:04,497 --> 01:16:06,837
Hey look man, I'm
walking as fast as I can.

1285
01:16:06,837 --> 01:16:08,487
- [Nicki] That sounds like Vince.

1286
01:16:12,287 --> 01:16:14,337
- What did you do to her?
- I didn't do anything.

1287
01:16:14,337 --> 01:16:15,906
- Where's my daughter?
- I swear to you,

1288
01:16:15,906 --> 01:16:18,874
I didn't do anything, what
are you talking about?

1289
01:16:27,952 --> 01:16:30,152
- I'll tell you Vince,
it doesn't look good.

1290
01:16:33,447 --> 01:16:35,097
Carla said you went after Stacy

1291
01:16:37,722 --> 01:16:41,897
and Bobby, well Bobby
says you never came back.

1292
01:16:41,897 --> 01:16:42,730
- What?

1293
01:16:42,730 --> 01:16:43,627
- Now if there's something you'd

1294
01:16:43,627 --> 01:16:46,113
like to tell me, now is the time.

1295
01:16:46,113 --> 01:16:47,857
- All right.

1296
01:16:47,857 --> 01:16:51,320
Bobby, he was wack man, like
screaming at her and stuff.

1297
01:16:53,937 --> 01:16:56,087
So he said he wanted
to go out to the lake.

1298
01:16:58,108 --> 01:17:01,437
Then he got real calm, he
said he wanted to talk.

1299
01:17:01,437 --> 01:17:03,123
- Come with me.

1300
01:17:03,123 --> 01:17:05,514
♪ Even when I didn't,
I didn't stop trying ♪

1301
01:17:05,514 --> 01:17:06,797
- Just for a minute.

1302
01:17:06,797 --> 01:17:08,437
♪ The trouble I've seen ♪

1303
01:17:08,437 --> 01:17:10,922

1308
01:17:32,625 --> 01:17:35,208
- He was gone about 10 minutes.

1309
01:17:36,328 --> 01:17:39,578
(anxious violin tones)

1310
01:17:42,469 --> 01:17:44,552
Bobby, what happened man?

1311
01:17:46,711 --> 01:17:47,628
- I did it.

1312
01:17:49,289 --> 01:17:50,617
- What are you talking about?

1313
01:17:50,617 --> 01:17:53,540
- If I can't have her, no one's gonna.

1314
01:17:54,627 --> 01:17:56,497
- Bobby, that's crazy.

1315
01:17:56,497 --> 01:17:57,547
What did you do, man?

1316
01:18:00,797 --> 01:18:02,020
What the hell did you do?

1317
01:18:05,597 --> 01:18:07,867
- I'm going to be honest with you, Bobby.

1318
01:18:07,867 --> 01:18:09,317
Here's what I think happened.

1319
01:18:10,517 --> 01:18:11,430
You had a fight.

1320
01:18:12,967 --> 01:18:14,167
Got carried away.
- No.

1321
01:18:15,777 --> 01:18:19,320
No I told you, I didn't--
- Just listen.

1322
01:18:21,057 --> 01:18:23,790
You had a fight, you're a strong guy.

1323
01:18:24,727 --> 01:18:27,127
Maybe you got her behind the neck,

1324
01:18:27,127 --> 01:18:28,877
one of those wrestling moves I bet.

1325
01:18:29,777 --> 01:18:33,460
Just trying to calm
her down, I understand.

1326
01:18:35,807 --> 01:18:37,880
Accidents happen.
- I swear to you,

1327
01:18:39,657 --> 01:18:42,477
I love Stacy, I'd never hurt her.

1328
01:18:42,477 --> 01:18:44,190
- Fine, fine but this was an accident.

1329
01:18:46,805 --> 01:18:47,740
Now here's the thing.

1330
01:18:49,197 --> 01:18:50,880
Tell me now and I can help you.

1331
01:18:53,273 --> 01:18:54,647
But when we find her body and come up with

1332
01:18:54,647 --> 01:18:56,847
your prints, I gotta
lock you up for murder.

1333
01:18:59,179 --> 01:19:01,790
So think about this, Bobby look at me.

1334
01:19:03,237 --> 01:19:04,992
I want you to seriously think

1335
01:19:04,992 --> 01:19:06,470
if there's something you need to say.

1336
01:19:10,417 --> 01:19:12,337
It's bothering you, see
that's what happens.

1337
01:19:12,337 --> 01:19:13,537
It starts to bother you.

1338
01:19:15,557 --> 01:19:17,807
You know where she is, help yourself.

1339
01:19:17,807 --> 01:19:19,057
Tell me the truth, Bobby.

1340
01:19:22,867 --> 01:19:23,700
- I told you,

1341
01:19:25,887 --> 01:19:27,067
you're wrong about me and Stacy.

1342
01:19:27,067 --> 01:19:28,807
- Come on.
- You don't understand.

1343
01:19:28,807 --> 01:19:30,660
- Bobby, it'll eat you up Bobby.

1344
01:19:31,667 --> 01:19:33,017
- Can't you see I'm mourning too?

1345
01:19:33,017 --> 01:19:36,247
If you'd just listen--
- No no no, you listen!

1346
01:19:36,247 --> 01:19:39,537
I know you had a fight,
I know you hurt her.

1347
01:19:39,537 --> 01:19:42,667
Do you want to go away
for the rest of your life?

1348
01:19:42,667 --> 01:19:44,167
Because I know you killed her.

1349
01:19:50,782 --> 01:19:54,346
Where is she Bobby, where'd you put her?

1350
01:19:54,346 --> 01:19:55,617
Where is Stacy?

1351
01:19:55,617 --> 01:19:56,667
Tell me where she is!

1352
01:19:57,678 --> 01:20:02,011
(anxious violin, light piano tones)

1353
01:20:04,371 --> 01:20:05,454
Think, Bobby.

1354
01:20:08,967 --> 01:20:13,310
- Stacy please, you don't know
how hard I've been trying.

1355
01:20:16,197 --> 01:20:18,227
It doesn't have to end like this.

1356
01:20:18,227 --> 01:20:20,407
- Bobby, I don't want you
to be mad or anything.

1357
01:20:20,407 --> 01:20:23,627
I want us both to be happy.
- Well then say it.

1358
01:20:23,627 --> 01:20:25,027
Promise you'll stay with me.

1359
01:20:25,987 --> 01:20:29,110
- I promise I'll never forget
what we had, that's it.

1360
01:20:31,427 --> 01:20:33,228
Take me home now.

1361
01:20:33,228 --> 01:20:34,410
- No, let me hold you.

1362
01:20:39,007 --> 01:20:39,840
Just a hug.

1363
01:20:42,137 --> 01:20:42,970
Just

1364
01:20:44,509 --> 01:20:45,342
one last kiss.

1365
01:20:48,317 --> 01:20:51,857
You promised we'd be together forever.

1366
01:20:51,857 --> 01:20:53,818
Bobby stop.
- We'd be together forever.

1367
01:20:53,818 --> 01:20:54,936
- Stop.
- Together forever.

1368
01:20:54,936 --> 01:20:56,467
- No.

1369
01:20:56,467 --> 01:20:58,286
(Stacy screams)

1370
01:20:58,286 --> 01:20:59,566
Bobby stop it!

1371
01:20:59,566 --> 01:21:00,964
No, Bobby.

1372
01:21:00,964 --> 01:21:02,557
Stop, no.

1373
01:21:02,557 --> 01:21:04,910
Bobby I love you, Bobby stop!

1374
01:21:14,409 --> 01:21:18,159
(anxious mid tempo drumbeat)

1375
01:21:47,249 --> 01:21:50,416
(helicopter whirring)

1376
01:21:51,983 --> 01:21:53,948
- I think we found something.

1377
01:21:53,948 --> 01:21:56,615
(truck beeping)

1378
01:21:58,546 --> 01:22:02,046
(police radio chattering)

1379
01:22:03,514 --> 01:22:06,681
- [Officer] Got about 10 minutes more.

1380
01:22:22,706 --> 01:22:27,487
- [Anderson] We'll let the
coroner make an assessment.

1381
01:22:27,487 --> 01:22:29,410
You get the photographer on the line?

1382
01:22:29,410 --> 01:22:31,910
- [Female Officer] Right away.

1383
01:22:33,581 --> 01:22:36,164
- Yeah, just tie it off.
- Okay.

1384
01:22:40,050 --> 01:22:42,769
- [Officer] You know what, hold off on it.

1385
01:22:42,769 --> 01:22:44,769
- No, this is not Stacy.

1386
01:22:47,222 --> 01:22:48,722
It can't be Stacy.

1387
01:22:49,894 --> 01:22:51,220
Oh god, no.

1388
01:22:51,220 --> 01:22:53,199
- Ma'am, I can't let you over there.

1389
01:22:53,199 --> 01:22:54,838
- Oh no!

1390
01:22:54,838 --> 01:22:58,005
(somber violin music)

1391
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:19,267
(Laura wailing)

1392
01:23:23,444 --> 01:23:25,227
- [Prosecutor] During that
time they were together,

1393
01:23:25,227 --> 01:23:28,807
did you ever see Bobby hit Stacy?

1394
01:23:28,807 --> 01:23:29,947
- [Carla] Yes.

1395
01:23:29,947 --> 01:23:31,037
- [Prosecutor] What were the circumstances

1396
01:23:31,037 --> 01:23:32,787
that would lead to his hitting her?

1397
01:23:35,387 --> 01:23:37,940
Shall I repeat the question?
- No.

1398
01:23:39,577 --> 01:23:42,800
Sometimes he'd hit her but
because she would aggravate him.

1399
01:23:43,835 --> 01:23:46,837
He'd tell her to do something
and she wouldn't do it.

1400
01:23:46,837 --> 01:23:48,070
Just that kinda stuff.

1401
01:23:49,127 --> 01:23:50,577
She'd do it to get attention,

1402
01:23:51,987 --> 01:23:54,335
even though he told her not to.

1403
01:23:54,335 --> 01:23:59,335
- I remember one day her
neck was bruised really bad.

1404
01:23:59,737 --> 01:24:04,737
So I was like that's it,
I'm gonna talk to Bobby.

1405
01:24:04,817 --> 01:24:07,327
- I just, I just thought that

1406
01:24:07,327 --> 01:24:10,190
if he hurt her, she would leave him.

1407
01:24:11,467 --> 01:24:13,867
I mean who's gonna stay
with a guy who hits you?

1408
01:24:14,947 --> 01:24:16,520
He can't force her to stay.

1409
01:24:17,887 --> 01:24:19,225
Right?

1410
01:24:19,225 --> 01:24:21,967
- And besides, Bobby's gone
out with lots of girls.

1411
01:24:21,967 --> 01:24:23,467
Nothing ever happened to them.

1412
01:24:25,624 --> 01:24:27,247
There was just no way he would hurt her.

1413
01:24:27,247 --> 01:24:30,910
- It's like you know how
guys are always talking,

1414
01:24:32,507 --> 01:24:37,507
what they did to a girl
or what they're gonna do?

1415
01:24:37,647 --> 01:24:41,060
But everybody knows that's just talking,

1416
01:24:42,647 --> 01:24:43,480
it's not real

1417
01:24:45,457 --> 01:24:47,730
and Bobby you know, he
was always our friend.

1418
01:24:48,677 --> 01:24:51,900
- So when I saw him hit her,
there was a part of me that,

1419
01:24:55,737 --> 01:24:57,137
okay I should've stopped it.

1420
01:24:59,338 --> 01:25:01,624
But I'm just thinking this is Bobby.

1421
01:25:01,624 --> 01:25:02,804
- "I love him."

1422
01:25:05,387 --> 01:25:06,910
That's all she said.

1423
01:25:09,917 --> 01:25:10,750
Whatever

1424
01:25:12,207 --> 01:25:13,847
he did, it was like

1425
01:25:15,937 --> 01:25:18,317
she was under his control, you know?

1426
01:25:19,927 --> 01:25:22,907
I begged her to let me tell but

1427
01:25:26,067 --> 01:25:27,987
she called it betrayal

1428
01:25:31,707 --> 01:25:33,650
and I did not want to lose her.

1429
01:25:37,946 --> 01:25:40,034
I did not want to lose Stacy.

1430
01:25:42,737 --> 01:25:44,974
I didn't want to lose my friend.
