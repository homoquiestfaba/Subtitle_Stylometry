[Johnny:]
I'm thinking!

This game isn't as

just say anything.

Never have I ever...

14
00:02:40,328 --> 00:02:42,129
[Johnny:] Okay, uh...

15
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:46,133
Never have I ever slept
with a homeless man.

both know that's not true.

Sleeping beauty awake.

[Ted:] Don't
change the subject.

19
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,342
Do tell.

20
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:55,409
[Michael:] Remember
two summers ago,

21
00:02:55,443 --> 00:02:57,611
you picked up that homeless
guy on Santa Monica,

22
00:02:57,645 --> 00:02:59,179
like 3 A.M.

23
00:02:59,213 --> 00:03:00,314
[Johnny:] He
was not homeless.

24
00:03:00,348 --> 00:03:00,848
[Michael:] He was
carrying around bags

25
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:01,282
of bottles and cans!

26
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:02,015
[Johnny:] So?

27
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:03,083
He was an
environmentalist.

28
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:06,186
[Ted:] And I guess that
makes you recycled goods.

[Ted:]
Oh.

33
00:03:13,594 --> 00:03:15,396
[Michael:] You know,
it was his goal

34
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:17,298
to sleep with every man
in West Hollywood.

35
00:03:17,331 --> 00:03:19,132

Mission accomplished.

00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,168

What are you
laughing about?

39
00:03:24,171 --> 00:03:26,707
You made a couple

Ted. Your turn.

Oh, okay, um...

00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:33,814
Never have I
ever done...

That's why you're

Cigarettes.

[Ted:] Oh, you know
smoking causes cancer.

52
00:03:48,262 --> 00:03:49,730
[Johnny:] Uh, not as much
as the second-hand smoke

53
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:50,398
you're about to inhale.

54
00:03:50,431 --> 00:03:53,401

00:04:04,412 --> 00:04:06,647
They probably hang
our kind out here.

[Johnny:] Oh,
consider me hung.

60
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:11,352
[Ted:] Oh, I'd let him
fill me up with premium.

61

any room left.

have cigarettes to buy?

need a cigarette after this.

Oh, I see.

They are going to
the bathroom together.

79
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:08,275
He didn't even finish
pumping this guy's gas!

80
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,610
How does he do it?

81
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:10,277

Do what?

You wanna see every

129
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:53,500
but I was hoping we'd be
in Manhattan tonight.

130

[Johnny:]
What is the rush?

131
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:56,169
Manhattan is going
nowhere, okay?

132
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:59,439
And maybe you don't wanna see
these beautiful Amish women,

Okay?

all about you.

About me?

You got your heart broken.

So fucking lighten up.
Have a little fun.

00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:15,555
[Ted:] Yeah, and besides my
dad gave me the credit card

140
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:18,558
so we have tons of money
for gas and hotels and food.

to all the pit stops.

there are any gay bars here?

is the rule of five?

has this saying

that every fifth
man is gay.

they know it or not.

only sleeping here tonight

you can stay in.

leave me all his money,

233
00:16:00,994 --> 00:16:03,830

Just once, Johnny?

left of vacation,

to New York City.

351
00:21:56,349 --> 00:21:58,418
* all over me,
all over me *

352
00:21:58,451 --> 00:22:02,188
[Johnny:] That is some kind
of pussy in the lion's den.

353
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:08,127
[music stops]
[cheering and applause]

354
00:22:09,362 --> 00:22:11,431
[music starts
playing again]

355
00:22:11,464 --> 00:22:14,200
[Johnny:] You could at least
have pretended to like it.

356
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:15,768
[Michael:] What was I
supposed to do with a woman?

357
00:22:15,802 --> 00:22:17,169
[Johnny:]
You're asking me?

358
00:22:17,203 --> 00:22:18,438
[Ted:] You were like
a deer in headlights.

359
00:22:18,471 --> 00:22:21,674
[Darla:] He's not the first man
to be stunned by my headlights.

360
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:24,310
The name's Darla, and I
believe I owe you a drink.

361
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:27,279
[Michael:] Uh, Michael.
Don't worry about it.

362
00:22:27,313 --> 00:22:28,147
[Darla:]
In that case,

363
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,081
I'm gonna need another
drink of my own.

364
00:22:29,115 --> 00:22:32,351
It's getting late
and I'm far too sober.

365
00:22:32,385 --> 00:22:33,386
Ah.

366
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,587
[laughter]

367
00:22:34,621 --> 00:22:36,656
What are three handsome
men like you doing

368
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:38,791
without a trio of pretty
ladies to match?

369
00:22:38,825 --> 00:22:41,227
[chuckles]

370
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:44,296
Ah, I thought you three
looked out of place.

371
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:46,132
[Johnny:] Yeah,
what gave us away?

372
00:22:46,165 --> 00:22:47,467
[Darla:] Well, the
shirt's a starter.

373
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,802
[Michael:] I told you
not to wear that.

374
00:22:49,836 --> 00:22:52,338
[Darla:] [laughs] So what brings
three fancy boys like you

375
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,272
out to this dump?

376
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:55,141
[Ted:] We're traveling
across the country

377
00:22:55,174 --> 00:22:56,342
from L.A. to New York.

378
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,243
[Darla:]
Well, well, well.

379
00:22:57,276 --> 00:22:58,144
You just got sick of
all that sunshine

380
00:22:58,177 --> 00:23:00,246
and handsome men out
on the West Coast?

381
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:02,615
[Johnny:] No, the handsome
men just got sick of me.

382
00:23:02,649 --> 00:23:04,484
[Ted:] We thought it
was time to explore

383
00:23:04,517 --> 00:23:06,285
our opportunities
on the East Coast.

384
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:07,520
[Darla:]
Oh.

385
00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:10,490
What about you,
you're awfully quiet.

386
00:23:10,523 --> 00:23:12,659
[Man:] Hey Darla,
get on over here.

387
00:23:12,692 --> 00:23:14,393
Let's get a
shot of whiskey.

388
00:23:14,427 --> 00:23:16,496
[Darla:] Oh Bob,
just a second.

389
00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:19,432
[Michael:] Guys, I think
I need a bathroom break.

390
00:23:19,466 --> 00:23:24,403
It's been really great
talking with you, Darla.

391
00:23:24,437 --> 00:23:26,405
[Darla:] He's a
mysterious one, isn't he?

392
00:23:26,439 --> 00:23:29,442
[Ted:] Yeah, he's
had a long day.

393
00:23:29,476 --> 00:23:32,244
[Darla:] [chuckles] Well, to
long days and longer nights.

394
00:23:32,278 --> 00:23:35,281
Woop!
[laughs]

395
00:23:35,715 --> 00:23:37,183
Now, if you
boys don't mind,

396
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:39,719
I think I'll go thank that
gentleman for the drink.

397
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:41,521
You boys be careful
in a place like this.

398
00:23:41,554 --> 00:23:44,423
[Johnny:] Don't worry, Darla,
I always carry protection.

399
00:23:44,457 --> 00:23:45,658
[chuckles]

400
00:23:46,593 --> 00:23:48,360
[Ted:] So do you think
he's coming back.

401
00:23:48,394 --> 00:23:49,228
[Johnny:]
Let's hope not.
Boring.

402
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,898
[Ted:] No, he just
needs to get laid.

403
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:56,268
[Johnny:] Or we could
always perk him up.
Tina's here!

404
00:23:56,302 --> 00:23:58,370
[Ted:] Oh my God,
Johnny, put that away.

405
00:23:58,404 --> 00:24:00,406
[Johnny:] [scoffs]
More for me.

406
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:03,142
[farting sounds]

407
00:24:19,425 --> 00:24:22,428
[applause]

408
00:24:25,364 --> 00:24:28,367
[Ted:] Maybe we
should call it a night?

409
00:24:29,435 --> 00:24:32,438
[Johnny:]
It's him.

410
00:24:34,373 --> 00:24:37,376
[Ted:]
It's who?

411
00:24:40,547 --> 00:24:41,848
No way.

412
00:24:41,881 --> 00:24:43,249
[Johnny:]
It has to be.

413
00:24:43,282 --> 00:24:45,217
[Ted:] Wait, is that why
you were so eager

414
00:24:45,251 --> 00:24:46,085
to come
out tonight?

415
00:24:46,118 --> 00:24:47,086
[Johnny:] Look, look!
He's looking.

416
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:49,355
[Ted:] And you're
looking for a hate crime.

417
00:24:49,388 --> 00:24:52,458
There's no way you're
going home with him tonight.

418
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,260
[Johnny:]
Watch me.

419
00:24:54,293 --> 00:24:55,394
[Ted:]
Johnny...

420
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:56,729
Johnny, no!

421
00:24:56,763 --> 00:24:58,765
Shit.

422
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,734
[Johnny:] You know,
you look better in person.

423
00:25:01,768 --> 00:25:04,136
[Bruno:] What
did you say to me?

424
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:09,408
[Johnny:] I said, haven't we
met at a glory hall before?

425
00:25:10,476 --> 00:25:11,343
[band members gasp]

426
00:25:11,377 --> 00:25:14,581
[Ted:]
Hey, hey, hey.

427
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:19,251
[smack]
[crowd gasps]

428
00:25:19,285 --> 00:25:20,720
[Betty:]
Bruno!

429
00:25:20,753 --> 00:25:22,354
I made it perfectly
clear to you,

430
00:25:22,388 --> 00:25:24,757
no more fighting
in my bar.

431
00:25:24,791 --> 00:25:27,393
[Bruno:] Well, I was just
minding my own business 'til

432
00:25:27,426 --> 00:25:31,397
Tinkerbell and his bodyguard
started fucking with me.

433
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:35,401
[Betty:] Yeah, well, you
have until I count to three

434
00:25:35,434 --> 00:25:37,403
to get the hell outta here,

435
00:25:37,436 --> 00:25:42,441
or I'm gonna put you up there
next to my 8-point buck!

436
00:25:42,474 --> 00:25:44,376
[Bruno:]
They started it!

437
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:46,579
[Betty:] Do you need
help with this, Bruno?

438
00:25:46,613 --> 00:25:48,380
One...

439
00:25:48,414 --> 00:25:50,783
[Bruno:]
Fucking piss hole!

440
00:25:50,817 --> 00:25:53,485
[Betty:]
Two..

441
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:54,921
[Bruno:]
[indistinct] bitch!

442
00:25:54,954 --> 00:25:58,357
[Betty:] Yeah?
Get to stuff it.

443
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:06,432
Show's over, everyone.

444
00:26:06,465 --> 00:26:10,469
[crowd murmurs]

445
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,707
[Michael:] Aw, shit,
you're bleeding.

446
00:26:14,741 --> 00:26:16,508
[Ted:] I think
I'll be all right.

447
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:17,744
[Johnny:] Just put
some whiskey on it.

448
00:26:17,777 --> 00:26:20,179
[Michael:] No more whiskey.
We're leaving.

449
00:26:20,212 --> 00:26:22,381
[Johnny:] He's fine.
[Michael:] He's not fine!

450
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:23,249
He just got punched
in the face.

451
00:26:23,282 --> 00:26:24,917
[Johnny:] He's not
a baby, loosen up.

452
00:26:24,951 --> 00:26:26,285
[Michael:] That's
really easy to say

453
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:27,620
when everyone else
takes the fall for you.

454
00:26:27,654 --> 00:26:29,521
We're going
back to the motel.

455
00:26:29,555 --> 00:26:31,724
[Johnny:] [sighs]
Fuck off, Michael.

456
00:26:31,758 --> 00:26:33,626
You know, don't blame
me for all your problems.

457
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,527
Some of us wanna live.

458
00:26:35,561 --> 00:26:37,329
Not like you who get
your heart broken

459
00:26:37,363 --> 00:26:38,297
and thinks
it's all over.

460
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:44,370
[Michael:] [scoffs]
Heartbreak? Fuck you!

461
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,547
[Johnny:]
I'm not going.

462
00:26:55,581 --> 00:26:56,649
[Michael:] This would've been
cute about 15 years ago.

463
00:26:56,683 --> 00:26:58,718
[Johnny:] Yeah, well, you're
not gonna ruin my night.

464
00:26:58,751 --> 00:27:02,254
[Michael:] Just get
in, you old hag.

465
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:03,690
[Johnny:]
Old hag? Really?

466
00:27:03,723 --> 00:27:06,492
Is that all you got in
your arsenal? Old hag?

467
00:27:06,525 --> 00:27:08,695
[Ted:]
Just get in, Johnny.

468
00:27:08,728 --> 00:27:11,330
[Michael:] [chuckles]
You know,

469
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:14,500
I got a theory about why you
keep stalling us on this trip.

470
00:27:14,533 --> 00:27:15,501
[Johnny:]
Enlighten me.

471
00:27:15,534 --> 00:27:18,504
[Michael:] You're
afraid to go back to L.A.

472
00:27:18,537 --> 00:27:20,406
[Johnny:]
[scoffs] Why?

473
00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:22,842
[Michael:] You keep saying
that this trip is about me.

474
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:25,477
That poor little Michael needs a
break from his pathetic life,

475
00:27:25,511 --> 00:27:28,547
but we both know this is just
as much an escape for you.

476
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,482
[Johnny:] What the fuck
are you talking about?

477
00:27:30,516 --> 00:27:31,650
[Michael:] What am
I talking about?

478
00:27:31,684 --> 00:27:33,820
You are a 36 year old
man running around

479
00:27:33,853 --> 00:27:37,356
like you're an 18
year old party boy!

480
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:39,291
Look at yourself!

481
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:41,828
[Johnny:] Last I looked,
I was doing just fine!

482
00:27:41,861 --> 00:27:43,896
[Michael:] If you consider
being a slutty, drugged out

483
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:45,898
party boy, doing just
fine, then yeah...

484
00:27:45,932 --> 00:27:50,536
But face it, you're
all washed up, Johnny.

485
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:54,606
* Music

486
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,545
Get in, Ted.

487
00:27:59,578 --> 00:28:00,847
[Johnny:] You know,
I got my own theory.

488
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,815
You think it should
have been me and not you.

489
00:28:02,849 --> 00:28:06,585
And you look down on me from
your pristine little pedestal.

490
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:10,356
Watch me party, think I should
be the one to pay the price.

491
00:28:10,389 --> 00:28:12,558
[mockingly]
Poor, little Michael.

492
00:28:12,591 --> 00:28:15,461
Life's not fair.

493
00:28:15,494 --> 00:28:17,396
Cope!

494
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:20,532
[car door slams shut]

495
00:28:20,566 --> 00:28:22,601

* Music

497
00:28:27,606 --> 00:28:29,575
[Johnny:]
My tab still open?

498
00:28:29,608 --> 00:28:31,677
Give it to me. Something
strong, anything.

499
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,246
Double, triple,
12 times.

500
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,482
Bucket loads. I want
the best you've got.

501
00:28:36,515 --> 00:28:38,450
Give it to me good.

502
00:28:38,484 --> 00:28:43,790
* Music

503
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,727
[Michael:]
All right...

504
00:28:49,695 --> 00:28:51,463
[Ted:] Ow!
[Michael:] Sorry.

505
00:28:51,497 --> 00:28:53,165
[Ted:] Oh God.
[Michael:] Sorry.

506
00:28:53,199 --> 00:28:56,135
[Ted:] Well, I guess I won't
be making out with any boys

507
00:28:56,168 --> 00:28:58,704
my first night in
New York City, huh?

508
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:01,607
First time I've ever been
punched in the face.

509
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,143
[Michael:] How did it feel?
[Ted:] It hurt!

510
00:29:04,176 --> 00:29:07,279
A lot. Like, losing
my virginity a lot.

511
00:29:07,313 --> 00:29:10,549
[Michael:] See, we are
making a man out of you.

512
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,584
[Ted:]
Ow, jeez.

513
00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:18,524
[Michael sighs]

514
00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:20,692
Hey, Michael?

515
00:29:20,726 --> 00:29:22,561
[Michael:]
Yeah?

516
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,630
What did Johnny
mean when he said

517
00:29:24,663 --> 00:29:27,633
you'd be the one to
pay the price for it?

518
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:31,170
[Michael:] [scoffs] It's just
Johnny running his mouth.

519
00:29:31,203 --> 00:29:33,672
[Ted:]
And...

520
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:37,609
What are all those pills
you keep in your bag?

521
00:29:37,643 --> 00:29:41,413
[Michael:]
[sighs]

522
00:29:41,447 --> 00:29:43,449
I'm positive.

523
00:29:46,953 --> 00:29:50,556
[Ted:] How long
have you known?

524
00:29:50,589 --> 00:29:54,626
[Michael:]
Two months.

525
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:57,663
It's what happened.

526
00:29:57,696 --> 00:30:04,636
My ex, he cheated on me
and he also got me infected.

527
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:08,574
[Ted:] Holy shit.
Why didn't you tell me?

528
00:30:08,607 --> 00:30:11,543
[Michael:] I don't know,
maybe I'm in denial,

529
00:30:11,577 --> 00:30:13,880
or maybe the way Johnny
reacted made it worse--

530
00:30:13,913 --> 00:30:16,582
[Ted:] Oh come-- I mean,
I'm your friend.

531
00:30:16,615 --> 00:30:18,484
[Michael:]
Oh, Teddy, I know,

532
00:30:18,517 --> 00:30:21,587
but Johnny and I
we go way back.

533
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:25,191
Back when we
were goth, not gay.

534
00:30:25,691 --> 00:30:27,659
He was...

535
00:30:29,195 --> 00:30:32,198
He was my first.

536
00:30:33,632 --> 00:30:36,602
[Ted:] Mine, too.
[Michael:] Son of a bitch!

537
00:30:36,635 --> 00:30:38,670
[Ted laughs]

538
00:30:38,704 --> 00:30:40,706
Really?

539
00:30:40,739 --> 00:30:41,874
[Ted:] Just
fucking with you.

540
00:30:41,908 --> 00:30:43,309
[laughter]

541
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:45,711
But you should have seen
the look on your face.

542
00:30:45,744 --> 00:30:47,679
Just like my mom.

543
00:30:47,713 --> 00:30:51,250
[Michael:] Look,
we worry about you.

544
00:30:51,283 --> 00:30:52,919
I know Johnny and I
joke a lot with you

545
00:30:52,952 --> 00:30:56,455
but you really do live
in an ivory tower.

546
00:30:56,488 --> 00:30:58,790
Well, an ebony
one, anyway.

547
00:30:58,824 --> 00:31:00,692
[Ted:]
Oh ho ho!

548
00:31:00,726 --> 00:31:01,693
Well, I mean,
that's why

549
00:31:01,727 --> 00:31:03,629
I wanted to come with
you guys on this trip.

550
00:31:03,662 --> 00:31:06,933
I know I'm sheltered but I
don't wanna be some diva.

551
00:31:06,966 --> 00:31:08,667
I want real
life experience.

552
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,835
Even if that means

553
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,803
I have to pay for it
with my trust fund.

554
00:31:11,837 --> 00:31:13,439
[Michael:] [chuckles]
Well, you got it.

555
00:31:13,472 --> 00:31:15,641
Right in the mouth.

556
00:31:15,674 --> 00:31:16,943
[Ted:] Yeah, I guess
I was wondering

557
00:31:16,976 --> 00:31:18,644
what it was like to get
punched in the face.

558
00:31:18,677 --> 00:31:20,679
[Michael:]
Congratulations.

559
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:28,387
[speaking indistinctly]

560
00:31:30,522 --> 00:31:32,658
[Frank:] Time to
close out, son.

561
00:31:32,691 --> 00:31:35,661
[Johnny:] Yeah, but it
should be time to put out.

562
00:31:35,694 --> 00:31:37,563
[Frank:]
I beg your pardon?

563
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:40,466
[Johnny:] [mockingly]
I beg your pardon.

564
00:31:40,499 --> 00:31:42,234
[Betty:] Is this going
to be a problem?

565
00:31:42,268 --> 00:31:43,602
[Frank:]
It's all right, Betty.

566
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:45,637
I'll close
this guy's tab.

567
00:31:45,671 --> 00:31:48,707
Why don't you head out
and I'll take the bike home.

568
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,708
[Betty:]
Are you sure?

569
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,410
[Frank:]
Yeah.

570
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:54,380
[Betty:] All right.
I'll see you at home.

571
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:56,615
[Frank:]
All right, bye.

572
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:58,650
[Betty:]
See you.

Uh, yeah.

Oh. I...

00:33:17,663 --> 00:33:20,566
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to wake you.

582
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:21,667
[Receptionist:]
Don't worry about it.

583
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,270
Do you always wake up
strangers for entertainment?

584
00:33:24,303 --> 00:33:25,704
[Michael:] [chuckles]
No, of course not.

585
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:27,473
I was just hoping you
could tell me what time

586

these parts?

587
00:33:28,974 --> 00:33:31,743

Uh, about now.

588
00:33:31,777 --> 00:33:33,645
[Michael:] Oh.

589
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:34,946
[Receptionist:] I mean, I've
got some whiskey in the back

590
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,482
if you need a
drink that bad.

591
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:37,683
[Michael:]
No, I was--

592
00:33:37,716 --> 00:33:38,684
I left some friends
back at the Lion's Den

593
00:33:38,717 --> 00:33:41,487
and I was thinking about
going to pick them up.

594
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,921
[Receptionist:]
The Lion's Den?

595
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:44,723
That...

596
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:47,326
It's kind of a dangerous
place for your kind.

597
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:49,495
[Michael:]
My kind?

598
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:51,297
[Johnny:] Let me
ask you a question.

599
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:57,903
What kind of person drives me
here to this godforsaken bar,

600
00:33:57,936 --> 00:34:01,173
and then just lets me
come here and miss me,

601
00:34:01,207 --> 00:34:04,710
doesn't even show up,
abandons me, like...

602
00:34:04,743 --> 00:34:07,746
[Frank:] I'm sure
I don't know.

603
00:34:13,852 --> 00:34:17,523
I appreciate your
business, Michael.

604
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:24,630
[Johnny:] [scoffs] You know,
being easy was always easy.

605
00:34:24,663 --> 00:34:29,168
I guess I thought it
would last forever.

606
00:34:29,201 --> 00:34:31,803
I don't have a
plan for the future.

607

[chuckles]

608
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:38,310
But everybody just
keeps getting younger

609
00:34:38,344 --> 00:34:45,351
and I'm starting
to feel invisible.

610
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:52,358
[Frank:] How do you
intend to get home? Hm?

611
00:34:52,391 --> 00:34:54,660
I'm I gonna have to
call the sheriff?

612
00:34:54,693 --> 00:34:57,463
[Johnny:]
Oh, that depends.

613
00:34:57,496 --> 00:34:59,831
Is he gonna
take me in cuffs?

[Frank:] Seems
pretty real to me.

The whole time?

627
00:36:05,764 --> 00:36:07,633

From the beginning.

For real?

already go over this?

gonna let me get [indistinct]

Who? Bruno?

He's all talk.
Kind of like you.

00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:30,789

could do a lot more than talk.

to go pick up my friend.

640
00:36:42,434 --> 00:36:43,702

said yourself you wanted

641
00:36:43,735 --> 00:36:44,603
to have a good time.

that obvious?

[Receptionist:]
Is what obvious?

648
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:04,556
[Michael:] You know, that
me and my friends were...

You know,

you're not like the
other townsfolk.

that as a compliment.

659
00:37:32,884 --> 00:37:35,253
[Johnny:] So, your
wife doesn't mind

660
00:37:35,287 --> 00:37:40,792
that you lure innocent
boys to your bar?

661
00:37:40,826 --> 00:37:45,864
[Frank:] Firstly, I wouldn't
call you innocent.

662
00:37:45,897 --> 00:37:48,967
Secondly, I love
Betty very much.

663
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,936
She knows that.

664
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:53,905
[Johnny:] I didn't
ask if you loved her.

665
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:56,308
[Frank:] You may not
understand this,

666
00:37:56,342 --> 00:37:58,377
but when you've loved
someone a long time

667
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:03,549
you learn to accept
little detours.

668
00:38:03,582 --> 00:38:06,652
[Johnny:] So in other words,
she turns a blind eye

669
00:38:06,685 --> 00:38:08,954
as long as you
play your part?

670
00:38:08,987 --> 00:38:12,924
[Frank:] [chuckles] You
could put it that way.

671
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:15,861
[Johnny:] So what
are you into?

672
00:38:15,894 --> 00:38:18,964
[Frank:] Well, I like mixing
drinks, shooting pool,

673
00:38:18,997 --> 00:38:21,867
and late night
conversation.

674
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,703
[Johnny:] That's
not what I meant.

675
00:38:24,736 --> 00:38:27,873
[Frank:] [sighs] Is that
all you came here for?

676
00:38:27,906 --> 00:38:32,911
[Johnny:] I don't sign on to
Bender looking for a husband.

677
00:38:32,944 --> 00:38:36,648
[Frank:]
 Touché.

678
00:38:36,682 --> 00:38:39,184
[Johnny:]
So?

679
00:38:39,217 --> 00:38:42,821
[Frank:]
So.

680
00:38:42,854 --> 00:38:48,660
Let's just say I'm into
some pretty heavy stuff.

681
00:38:48,694 --> 00:38:50,629
[Johnny:] Oh yeah?
[Frank:] Yeah.

682
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:53,899
[Johnny:] Well, I've been
around the block a little bit.

Not much surprises me.

[Frank:] I think I can
teach you a thing or two.

685

[Johnny:]
Oh really?

686
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:02,207

Mmh-hm.

and i'm an apt--

688
00:39:05,911 --> 00:39:08,179
or rapt pupil.

689
00:39:08,213 --> 00:39:09,815
[Frank:] Uh-uh.

690
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:13,852
First tell me what
you are into.

691
00:39:14,953 --> 00:39:17,322
[Johnny:] I've never
done it on a straight bar.

692
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,891
[laughter]

693
00:39:19,925 --> 00:39:22,293
[Frank:] But I just
wiped her down.

694
00:39:22,327 --> 00:39:25,731
[Johnny:]
Yeah, well, uh.

695
00:39:25,764 --> 00:39:26,832
Not much time left,

696
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:31,236
and I think you've tortured
me enough for one night.

697
00:39:31,269 --> 00:39:33,972
[Frank:] We'll
see about that.

698
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:39,177
You know what's wrong
with you city guys?

699
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,212
[Johnny:]
What?

700
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:46,384
[Frank:] You're so focused
on the destination.

701
00:39:46,418 --> 00:39:50,288
[Johnny:] And what
is wrong with that?

702
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:51,757
[Frank:]
For one,

703
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:54,726
the destination rarely
lives up to expectations.

704
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,194
[Johnny:]
Aw...

705
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,764
Are you setting me up
for disappointment?

706
00:39:58,797 --> 00:40:03,334
[Frank:] Secondly, if
you'd stop and think,

707
00:40:03,368 --> 00:40:08,740
you'd notice you're losing
the feeling in your legs.

708
00:40:08,774 --> 00:40:11,577
[Johnny:] What
did you just say?

709
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:14,713
[Frank:] There was just a
little special ingredient

710
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:17,916
in that cocktail
of yours.

711
00:40:17,949 --> 00:40:20,819
[clattering]

712
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:24,289
Where you going, Johnny?

713
00:40:24,322 --> 00:40:27,292
The party is just
getting started.

714
00:40:27,325 --> 00:40:29,294
[laughter]

715
00:40:32,498 --> 00:40:37,536
[laughter]

716
00:40:37,569 --> 00:40:39,538
[Receptionist:] So the
sheriff comes in, right,

717
00:40:39,571 --> 00:40:40,405
with his girlfriend.

718
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:41,239
[Michael:] No?
[Receptionist:] Oh yeah.

719
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,274
I give him his
regular room, okay?

720
00:40:43,308 --> 00:40:46,612
Ten minutes later,
his wife shows up.

721
00:40:46,645 --> 00:40:47,879
[Michael:]
What did you do?

722
00:40:47,913 --> 00:40:49,314
[Receptionist:] She had
a boyfriend with her.

723
00:40:49,347 --> 00:40:51,216
[Michael:] Shut up!
You're kidding?

724
00:40:51,249 --> 00:40:54,285
[Receptionist:] [laughs]
No. So I gave her a room.

725
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:55,253
[Michael:]
You did not.

726
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,722
[Receptionist:] Right
next to the sheriff.

727
00:40:56,755 --> 00:40:59,290
[laughter]

728
00:40:59,324 --> 00:41:01,159
[Michael:]
Oh god.

729
00:41:03,662 --> 00:41:05,664
* Music

730
00:41:33,659 --> 00:41:35,326
[Johnny:]
[coughs]

731
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,295
Where am I?

732
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,330
Michael?

733
00:41:40,298 --> 00:41:41,567
Michael?

734
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:49,340
Help!

735
00:41:49,374 --> 00:41:52,310
[Betty:]
You're awake.

736
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,945
Sorry, to catch
you off guard.

737
00:41:53,979 --> 00:41:55,380
[Johnny:] What are
you doing to me?

738
00:41:55,413 --> 00:41:56,782
[Betty:] I'm sure
I'm not the hookup

739
00:41:56,815 --> 00:41:58,416
you were hoping
for tonight.

740
00:41:58,449 --> 00:41:59,651
But don't you worry,

741
00:41:59,685 --> 00:42:04,289
I'm gonna let you and Frank
finish up in just a little bit.

742
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,295
Oh, I hope
you don't mind.

743
00:42:10,328 --> 00:42:12,397
I helped myself to a bit
of your party favors.

744
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:14,432
[Johnny groans]

745
00:42:16,334 --> 00:42:18,336
[sniffs]

746
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:23,441
I'm sure you're wondering
why on Earth you're here.

747
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:26,978
Or what I'm doing here.

748
00:42:27,012 --> 00:42:29,347
Let's just say you
shouldn't trust everyone

749
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,817
you meet on
the internet.

750
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:35,286
It's a dangerous
world out there.

751
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,255
I'm also in here because
of a little dilemma

752
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:39,958
that Frank and I have.

753
00:42:39,991 --> 00:42:42,260
Mmh-hm.

754
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:43,561
You see, a
few years back

755
00:42:43,595 --> 00:42:46,765
Frank and I started
to have problems.

756
00:42:46,798 --> 00:42:48,266
I found out...

757
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:50,802
And I won't say how...

758
00:42:50,836 --> 00:42:55,373
But I found out that
Frank here likes men.

759
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:58,910
Men like you.

760
00:42:58,944 --> 00:43:01,279
At first I didn't
understand it,

761
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:02,814
but then I realized

762
00:43:02,848 --> 00:43:05,450
every relationship
has its speed bumps.

763
00:43:05,483 --> 00:43:07,218
Right?

764
00:43:07,252 --> 00:43:09,688
But I know
Frank loves me.

765
00:43:09,721 --> 00:43:11,456
And I love Frank.

766
00:43:11,489 --> 00:43:12,357
[Frank moans]

767
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:16,527
So we learnt to make
some compromises.

768
00:43:16,561 --> 00:43:19,297
And that's where
you come in.

769
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:23,301
[Frank moans]

770
00:43:23,334 --> 00:43:27,338
Oh, I almost forgot.
Honey...

771
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:31,209
[Johnny:]
No, I don't wanna--

772
00:43:31,242 --> 00:43:34,646
[Betty:] Oh yes,
you do. Trust me.

773
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,882
It's for your own good.

774
00:43:36,915 --> 00:43:42,620
The last boy managed to bite
right through his own tongue.

775
00:43:42,654 --> 00:43:46,391
Oh, don't worry, we got a
roofie cocktail so strong

776
00:43:46,424 --> 00:43:49,327
you won't
remember a thing.

777
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,930
See, at first I
would just watch.

778
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:54,332
But then I decided to
get a little creative.

779
00:43:54,365 --> 00:44:00,205
Now I control you.
This is our favorite part.

780
00:44:00,238 --> 00:44:01,639
[Johnny groans]

781
00:44:01,673 --> 00:44:04,676
[Frank groans]

782
00:44:06,344 --> 00:44:08,446
[Betty:] [laughs]
You see?

783
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:11,449
Now, I get to have
a little fun, too.

784
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:14,352
And Frank just loves the
way you clench up like that,

785
00:44:14,385 --> 00:44:16,387
don't you Frank?

786
00:44:18,623 --> 00:44:21,426
[electric buzzing]
[Johnny groaning]

787
00:44:21,459 --> 00:44:24,362
[Betty:]
Oh come on, baby.

788
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:24,896
Yeah.

789
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:28,867
That's it.
Yeah.

790
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,501
I love you, Frank.

791
00:44:30,535 --> 00:44:33,371
[Frank:] I love
you too, Betty.

792
00:44:33,404 --> 00:44:34,405

00:44:34,439 --> 00:44:36,875
[Johnny laughs]

794
00:44:36,908 --> 00:44:39,377
[Betty:]
Something funny?

795
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:41,379
[Johnny:] You
two are pathetic!

796
00:44:41,412 --> 00:44:43,481
You can't even
fuck each other.

797
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:44,482
[laughter]

798
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:47,452
[Betty:] Shut up!
Learn to trust true love.

799
00:44:47,485 --> 00:44:49,387
It's something
you'll never have!

800
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:52,390
[Johnny choking]

801
00:44:52,423 --> 00:44:54,459
[Frank groans]

802
00:44:54,492 --> 00:44:57,295
Fuck him, Frank!
Fuck him!

803
00:44:57,328 --> 00:44:59,497
Teach this little
faggot a lesson!

804
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:02,667
Rip him apart, baby!

805
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,903
Fuck him, Frank.

806
00:45:04,936 --> 00:45:07,305
Get him.
Hurt him, baby.

807
00:45:07,338 --> 00:45:10,675
Hurt him!
No more games.

808
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,878
Rip him with your cock!
Hurt him!

809
00:45:12,911 --> 00:45:16,447
You're not laughing now,
are you, you little shit?

810
00:45:16,481 --> 00:45:18,483
Come, baby, come!

811
00:45:18,516 --> 00:45:21,319

817
00:45:34,665 --> 00:45:37,235
Oh shit!
We killed him, baby.

818
00:45:37,268 --> 00:45:38,469
We don't
wanna kill him.

819
00:45:38,503 --> 00:45:39,470
[Betty:] He's fine.
[Frank:] No, he's not.

820
00:45:39,504 --> 00:45:40,906
Get him up.

821
00:45:40,939 --> 00:45:42,941
[Betty:] It's just the drugs.
He's passed out, Frank.

822
00:45:42,974 --> 00:45:45,343
[Frank:] What the fuck?
[Betty:] Wait a second.

823
00:45:45,376 --> 00:45:48,413
Just let him
catch his breath.

824

[Frank:] Fuck!
I'll get him up.

825

Turn him on his side.

the fuck, Betty?

You shot him?

[Betty:] What was
I supposed to do?

856
00:48:18,263 --> 00:48:20,298
[Frank:] He's supposed to wake
up on the side of the road

857
00:48:20,331 --> 00:48:22,567
with a sore ass and one
hell of a hangover.

858

he's been asking for.

we supposed to do now?

862

[Betty:] Uh, I don't know.
Get rid of him.

863
00:48:36,714 --> 00:48:39,350
Take his body and
get the fuck rid of it.

864

about his friends?

00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:49,694
So what the fuck
are we gonna do now?

00:49:48,919 --> 00:49:51,656
[Michael:]
Son of a bitch!

874
00:49:51,689 --> 00:49:54,892
Really?

875
00:49:54,925 --> 00:49:57,595
I'm not getting
out of bed.

876
00:49:57,628 --> 00:50:00,331
[Betty:]
Hello?

877
00:50:00,365 --> 00:50:02,633
[Michael:]
Who is this?

878
00:50:02,667 --> 00:50:04,602
[Betty:] I'm calling
from the Lion's Den.

879
00:50:04,635 --> 00:50:05,703
I'm the bartender.

880
00:50:05,736 --> 00:50:08,806
Were you one of the guys
that were over here tonight?

881
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:11,776
[Michael:]
Uh, yeah.

882
00:50:11,809 --> 00:50:13,678
Where's Johnny?

883
00:50:13,711 --> 00:50:16,781
[Betty:] Passed out on the
bar, and going nowhere fast.

884
00:50:16,814 --> 00:50:19,817
And I have half a mind to call
the cops to come pick him up.

885
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:23,621
[Michael:] No, no, no, no.
Please, don't do that.

886
00:50:23,654 --> 00:50:24,555
Um...

887
00:50:24,589 --> 00:50:26,457
[Betty:] Well, hurry
up and get over here

888
00:50:26,491 --> 00:50:28,593
or that's exactly what
I'm going to do.

889
00:50:28,626 --> 00:50:30,595
[Michael:]
Of course.

890
00:50:30,628 --> 00:50:32,697
[Betty:] And one
other thing sweetheart...

891
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:33,964
[Michael:]
Uh, yeah?

892
00:50:33,998 --> 00:50:36,634
[Betty:] You had another friend
with you here tonight, right?

893
00:50:36,667 --> 00:50:39,804
[Michael:] Uh, yeah.
He's here with me now.

894
00:50:39,837 --> 00:50:41,639
[Betty:] Well, you both
better come over here

895
00:50:41,672 --> 00:50:42,707
to pick up your friend.

896
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:45,410
See, I'm a little lady and
your friend right now

897
00:50:45,443 --> 00:50:47,578
looks like he weighs
a ton of bricks,

898
00:50:47,612 --> 00:50:49,880
you know what
I'm saying?

899
00:50:49,914 --> 00:50:52,383
[Michael:]
Ugh. Right.

900
00:50:52,417 --> 00:50:55,720
We're on our way. Just
please, don't call the police.

901
00:50:55,753 --> 00:50:57,755
Thank you.

903
00:51:13,037 --> 00:51:14,772
Wake up!

904
00:51:14,805 --> 00:51:15,740
Get up!

905
00:51:15,773 --> 00:51:19,910
[Ted:] No!
[Michael:] Get up!

906
00:51:19,944 --> 00:51:24,715
Johnny got himself plastered
and we need to go pick him up.

907
00:51:24,749 --> 00:51:27,385
[Ted:] Oh,
surprise, surprise.

908
00:51:27,418 --> 00:51:29,420
[Michael:] And I'm
pretty fucked up myself,

909
00:51:29,454 --> 00:51:33,858
so you're gonna
have to drive.

910
00:51:33,891 --> 00:51:36,727
[Ted:] Oh god.
[Michael:] Come on!

911
00:51:36,761 --> 00:51:41,832
You wanted that whole,
you know, that life thing.

[Ted:] Are we at
the same place?

915
00:52:15,733 --> 00:52:18,569
[Michael:]
This is weird.

916
00:52:18,603 --> 00:52:21,772
[Ted:] It was scary enough
with all those townspeople.

917
00:52:21,806 --> 00:52:23,841
[Michael sighs]

918
00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:25,910
Wait, wait
where you going?

919
00:52:25,943 --> 00:52:28,012
[Michael:] [sighs]
To collect the queen.

920
00:52:28,045 --> 00:52:30,248
[Ted:]
Okay.

921
00:52:30,915 --> 00:52:32,917
* Music

922
00:52:40,658 --> 00:52:42,893
[Michael:] We're her to
get our friend over there.

923

[Ted:]
Oh my god.

924
00:52:44,795 --> 00:52:47,898
[Betty:] Yeah,
your poor friend.

925
00:52:47,932 --> 00:52:50,000
He didn't get like
that for free, you guys.

926
00:52:50,034 --> 00:52:52,470
I'm sorry, but we have a
tab we have to settle up.

927
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:53,771
[Michael:]
Of course we do.

928
00:52:53,804 --> 00:52:55,473
[laughter]

929
00:52:55,506 --> 00:52:59,944
You see, our friend is not the
most responsible drinker.

930
00:52:59,977 --> 00:53:00,745
What's the tab?

931
00:53:00,778 --> 00:53:02,747
[Betty:]
$18.

932
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:05,250
[Michael:]
$18? [laughs]

933
00:53:05,283 --> 00:53:09,454
Is that all it costs to get
plastered in this town?

934
00:53:09,487 --> 00:53:10,655
Here you go.

935
00:53:10,688 --> 00:53:12,823
[Betty:] Well, yeah,
but your friend started

936
00:53:12,857 --> 00:53:14,792
this tab with
a credit card.

937
00:53:14,825 --> 00:53:17,295
[Ted:] Johnny doesn't
own a credit card.

938
00:53:17,328 --> 00:53:20,798
[Betty:] Oh, yes.
Says his name is Michael.

939
00:53:20,831 --> 00:53:21,932
[Michael:]
That's my card.

940
00:53:21,966 --> 00:53:23,734
[Betty:]
Oh, I'm sorry.

941
00:53:23,768 --> 00:53:26,937
We have a $40 minimum on
credit card transactions,

942
00:53:26,971 --> 00:53:29,774
and I already closed up
the drawer for the night.

943
00:53:29,807 --> 00:53:32,743
[Michael:] Oh,
I'm gonna kill him.

944
00:53:32,777 --> 00:53:35,346
[Betty:] Look, I don't see a
problem to serve you guys

945
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:36,847
a few drinks to make
up the difference.

946
00:53:36,881 --> 00:53:39,284
[Ted:] No--
[Michael:] Oh, that'd be great.

947
00:53:39,317 --> 00:53:42,019
Stop! I like
her idea better.

948
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:43,921
[Ted:] He's not
looking too good.

949
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:45,923
I really think we need
to get him to the motel.

950
00:53:45,956 --> 00:53:48,926
[Michael:] That bitch
has never looked better.

951
00:53:48,959 --> 00:53:49,994
[Betty:]
Anything you want.

952
00:53:50,027 --> 00:53:51,829
[Michael:] We're gonna
have two shots of whiskey.

953
00:53:51,862 --> 00:53:53,931
Straight.

954
00:53:53,964 --> 00:53:55,099
[Betty:] You know boys,

955
00:53:55,132 --> 00:53:58,636
I don't normally pry into my
customers personal lives,

956
00:53:58,669 --> 00:54:01,238
I leave that sort of
thing up to Darla.

957
00:54:01,272 --> 00:54:02,373
[Michael chuckles]

958
00:54:02,407 --> 00:54:07,312
But, I have to say you
three are a little different.

959
00:54:07,345 --> 00:54:10,815
[Michael:] [chuckles]
That's not exactly prying.

960
00:54:10,848 --> 00:54:12,650
We stick out like a
[indistinct] thumb

961
00:54:12,683 --> 00:54:13,951
in this town.

962
00:54:13,984 --> 00:54:14,685
[Betty:] Nah.

963
00:54:14,719 --> 00:54:16,821
But let me give
you some advice.

964
00:54:16,854 --> 00:54:20,358
Getting drunk and starting
fights in a place like this

965
00:54:20,391 --> 00:54:23,260
is not a bright idea
for out-of-towners.

966
00:54:23,294 --> 00:54:26,464
Especially if
you're eccentric.

967
00:54:26,497 --> 00:54:29,967
But Frank and I, we
believe in hospitality.

968
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,738
[Michael:]
[laughs]

969
00:54:33,771 --> 00:54:35,906
Trust me, it's not
this town at all.

970
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:38,809
You see our friend
over there? [laughs]

971
00:54:38,843 --> 00:54:41,512
He's got kicked out of
some of the gayest places

972
00:54:41,546 --> 00:54:44,882
on the fucking
West Coast.

973
00:54:44,915 --> 00:54:47,918
To ending the ride!

974
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:54,291
[Ted:] I'm driving.
[Michael:] Suit yourself.

975
00:54:54,325 --> 00:54:56,327
What does that bring us to?

976
00:54:56,361 --> 00:54:58,329
[Betty:] Only
$10 more to go.

977
00:54:58,363 --> 00:54:59,864
[Michael:] Two more
shots of whiskey!

978
00:54:59,897 --> 00:55:01,966
[Ted:] No, I think
we've had enough.

979
00:55:01,999 --> 00:55:03,434
[Michael:]
Two more shots!

980
00:55:03,468 --> 00:55:04,669
[Ted:] What the hell
are you trying to prove?

981
00:55:04,702 --> 00:55:07,438
[Michael:] I'm just
trying to live a little.

982
00:55:07,472 --> 00:55:10,508
You know,
while I'm alive.

983
00:55:10,541 --> 00:55:12,543
[Betty:]
There you go.

984
00:55:13,378 --> 00:55:13,944
[broom crashes
to the floor]

985
00:55:13,978 --> 00:55:16,347
[Frank:]
Going somewhere?

986
00:55:16,381 --> 00:55:18,816
[Ted:] Yeah, to put
my friend in the car.

987
00:55:18,849 --> 00:55:20,618
[Frank:] No, no, no.
Fuck that.

988
00:55:20,651 --> 00:55:22,853
Have a seat and
finish your drinks.

989
00:55:22,887 --> 00:55:23,521
[Betty:] Yeah.
[smack]

990
00:55:23,554 --> 00:55:25,723
[Ted:] Ow.
What the hell?

991
00:55:25,756 --> 00:55:27,792
Excuse you?

992
00:55:27,825 --> 00:55:31,396
God, I can't believe I'm
the responsible one now.

993
00:55:31,429 --> 00:55:33,831
[Michael:] I don't
feel so well...

did you that for?

That's a freaking $60
bottle of scotch, Frank!

1000
00:55:48,879 --> 00:55:52,683

[Michael:] What
did you do to me?

1007
00:57:56,473 --> 00:58:01,445
[Betty:] Oh, I gave you a
cocktail for special guests.

1008
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:06,016
An adrenaline shot.

gonna kill me?

We're gonna have fun first.

This is what I like to call a
frustrated wife's best friend.

at least.

01:00:30,327 --> 01:00:32,262
You don't understand,
you see.

1041
01:00:32,296 --> 01:00:38,402
My relationship with Frank,
it's made me numb for years.

1042
01:00:38,435 --> 01:00:39,603
[Michael:] What the
fuck are you doing?

1043
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:42,272
[Betty laughs]

1044
01:00:42,306 --> 01:00:43,473
Oh God.

1045
01:00:43,507 --> 01:00:48,779
[Betty:] [laughs] But tonight
I'm feeling really alive,

1046
01:00:48,813 --> 01:00:51,381
like I woke up
from a dream.

1047
01:00:51,415 --> 01:00:54,351
[Michael:]
Oh, oh my God.

1048
01:00:54,384 --> 01:00:56,453
[Betty:]
Oh, that's my boy.

1049
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:57,722
[laughs]

1050
01:00:57,755 --> 01:01:00,424
[Michael:] Oh my God,
this is so embarrassing.

1051
01:01:00,457 --> 01:01:01,759
[Betty:]
Oh, trust me,

1052
01:01:01,792 --> 01:01:04,361
this is nothing to be
embarrassed about.

1053
01:01:04,394 --> 01:01:05,763
[Michael:]
What are you doing?

1054
01:01:05,796 --> 01:01:07,631
[Betty:]
Shhh...

1055
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:10,434
[Michael:] I wouldn't do
this if I were you. Wait...

1056
01:01:10,467 --> 01:01:11,936
Get off of me.

1057
01:01:11,969 --> 01:01:13,437
Get off of me!

1058
01:01:13,470 --> 01:01:14,872
[Betty:] Shut up!
[Michael:] Get off!

1059
01:01:14,905 --> 01:01:17,908
[Betty:] Shut up, or I will
put this fucking needle

1060
01:01:17,942 --> 01:01:20,544
in your fucking eye.

1061
01:01:20,577 --> 01:01:22,279
[sobs]

1062
01:01:22,312 --> 01:01:26,717
You fucking baby!
Quit your fucking crying!

1063
01:01:26,751 --> 01:01:31,288
Shut up and just relax.

Oh, oh, oh.

1067
01:01:40,497 --> 01:01:43,433
I forgot what
this felt like.

1068
01:01:43,467 --> 01:01:46,303
Oh, come on,
you like it.

1069
01:01:46,336 --> 01:01:48,305
Yeah, oh.

1070
01:01:49,339 --> 01:01:52,042
Oh, fuck me, baby.

1071
01:01:52,076 --> 01:01:54,311

01:03:47,091 --> 01:03:48,392
Oh, a key.

Oh, what do
we have here?

1096
01:03:57,667 --> 01:04:00,570
Your other friend had
things in his pockets, too.

1097
01:04:00,604 --> 01:04:03,373
Look, more
party favors.

[Betty:] You have AIDS?
[Michael:] Yep.

1101

It's the gift that keeps
on giving, you cunt.

[Betty:] You
fucking piece of shit.

How could you
let me do that?

1104

You took, you
took my Frank!

I was happy until you
cunts started coming around.

1175
01:10:16,780 --> 01:10:18,482
[Ted v/o:] Killing a 
 man is something

1176
01:10:18,515 --> 01:10:21,451
you can never 
 take back.

1177
01:10:21,485 --> 01:10:22,852
My lawyer claimed 
 it was self defense

1178
01:10:22,886 --> 01:10:25,689
and I was just 
 protecting Michael.

1179
01:10:25,722 --> 01:10:27,791
The jury agreed.

1180
01:10:27,824 --> 01:10:30,927
But deep down 
 there's a part of me,

1181
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:34,798
an inner rage that was 
 released that night.

1182
01:10:34,831 --> 01:10:37,834
I believe Michael had 
 vengeance in his heart too,

1183
01:10:37,867 --> 01:10:40,804
but we've never 
 talked about it.

1184
01:10:40,837 --> 01:10:42,706
Partly due to our 
 lawyers' advice

1185
01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:46,676
but mostly because if we were 
 ever to face each other again,

1186
01:10:46,710 --> 01:10:49,513
we'd see the guilt 
 in each other's eyes.

1187
01:10:49,546 --> 01:10:53,817
Not for killing two people, 
 but for abandoning Johnny.

1188
01:10:53,850 --> 01:10:58,688
And for that I'll 
 never forgive myself.

1189
01:10:58,722 --> 01:11:01,825
So I come here 
 every year,

1190
01:11:01,858 --> 01:11:04,861
not only to mourn the 
 passing of Johnny,

1191
01:11:04,894 --> 01:11:07,731
but the loss of 
 Michael's friendship,

1192
01:11:07,764 --> 01:11:11,768
and the death 
 of my innocence.

1193
01:11:12,802 --> 01:11:15,939
I vow to never forget 
 that life is fragile.

1194
01:11:15,972 --> 01:11:19,809
Every moment, 
 a precious gift.

1195
01:11:19,843 --> 01:11:24,013
And that it can all be 
 destroyed in an instant.

1196
