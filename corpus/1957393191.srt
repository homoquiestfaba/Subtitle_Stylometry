Oh my God, what was that?

00:00:59,167 --> 00:01:01,667
JOHNNY: What?

00:01:01,767 --> 00:01:02,633
Johnny!

00:01:02,733 --> 00:01:03,767
Some-- somebody's at the window.

00:01:03,867 --> 00:01:04,767
JOHNNY: I don't hear anything.

9
00:01:04,867 --> 00:01:07,833
Johnny, somebody's watching us.

So No, I honestly don't
think I'm aroused by this.

20
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:40,633
OK, no substantial arousal.

21
00:02:40,733 --> 00:02:42,367

OK, here it comes!

26
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:55,800
OK, oh, Johnny, kiss me.

Oh, shit, I think
I singed my cornea!

Oh, je-- I gotta
get out of the way.

00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,500
No don't do that!

30
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,000
I don't want my
parents to see these.

Oh!

00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,233

it, show's over, let's get--

Oh, shit!

39
00:04:10,433 --> 00:04:12,567
Ow!

40
00:04:12,667 --> 00:04:14,067
I can't see.

41
00:04:14,167 --> 00:04:14,867
I'm seeing spots.

42
00:04:14,967 --> 00:04:16,300
Are you seeing spots?

43
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,700
Hey, do you see
Murray anywhere?

44
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,733
No, look, there's a booth.

45
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,400
Here it is.

46
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:43,167
Oh, my-- Put it there, Murray.

47
00:04:43,267 --> 00:04:43,967
Congratulations.

48
00:04:47,033 --> 00:04:49,267
What about the label?

49
00:04:49,367 --> 00:04:50,100
OK.

50
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,600
I talked to the label.

51
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:55,133
They said they don't
need to see you perform.

52
00:04:55,233 --> 00:04:58,000
The demo was enough.

53
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,000
[laughing]

54
00:05:01,433 --> 00:05:02,167
So how long?

55
00:05:02,267 --> 00:05:04,200
How long do you think it'll be?

56
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,100
Well, their lawyers
are looking over

57
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:11,767
the memo I drew up specifying
the deal and your advance.

58
00:05:11,867 --> 00:05:21,067
They'll make suggestions, we'll
make changes, then you'll sign.

59
00:05:21,167 --> 00:05:23,100
That's great!

60
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,200
That's incredible!

61
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,767
But how long?

62
00:05:26,867 --> 00:05:28,633
How long do you think?

63
00:05:28,733 --> 00:05:29,633
OK.

64
00:05:29,733 --> 00:05:32,133
I know you're excited.

65
00:05:32,233 --> 00:05:36,067
But you don't mess around
with a major record label.

66
00:05:36,167 --> 00:05:37,967
These guys are real sticklers.

67
00:05:40,933 --> 00:05:44,967
I'd say we're looking at a week.

68
00:05:48,567 --> 00:05:49,467
That's great!

69
00:05:53,067 --> 00:05:54,700
Good work, Murray!

70
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,200
Good work.

71
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,167
Here's to us.

72
00:05:59,267 --> 00:05:59,967
Here's to us.

73
00:06:00,067 --> 00:06:00,767
Here's to us.

74
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:09,867
So, I'll call my brother
first in the morning.

75
00:06:09,967 --> 00:06:15,500
Borrow his van, have you moved
in first thing Sunday morning.

76
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,867
All right?

77
00:06:16,967 --> 00:06:18,833
All right.

78
00:06:18,933 --> 00:06:21,967
[door opening]

79
00:06:22,067 --> 00:06:25,533
Oh, fuck you!

80
00:06:25,633 --> 00:06:26,333
Ah, more wine.

81
00:06:26,433 --> 00:06:27,967
What a surprise.

82
00:06:28,067 --> 00:06:29,100
Fuck you, you fucker!

83
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,133
Ah, a new vocabulary word.

84
00:06:30,233 --> 00:06:33,867
Where'd you get your
education, K-Mart?

[music playing]

86
00:07:58,433 --> 00:08:01,200
I can't believe you
asked her to move in.

87
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,667
What were you thinking?

88
00:08:02,767 --> 00:08:04,300
We've been together six months.

89
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,967
You told me the relationship
wasn't going anywhere.

90
00:08:07,067 --> 00:08:09,133
I don't think of it
as going anywhere.

91
00:08:09,233 --> 00:08:10,633
It's just moving a few blocks.

92
00:08:10,733 --> 00:08:13,433
I don't want to say you're
making a big mistake.

93
00:08:13,533 --> 00:08:15,133
But you're making
a big mistake here.

94
00:08:15,233 --> 00:08:16,800
I mean, it's all
going to go downhill.

95
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,300
You have the sex--
you're going to start

96
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,167
shopping for preschools soon.

97
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:23,833
Look, I have finally got
my entire life in order.

98
00:08:23,933 --> 00:08:27,467
My album's out, I'm going to
be signed to a major label

99
00:08:27,567 --> 00:08:30,300
within a week, Murray's
putting a tour together,

100
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,900
and Annie's moving in.

101
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,467
It's perfect.

102
00:08:33,567 --> 00:08:34,567
I saw you look.

103
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:35,767
-I did not look.
-You looked.

104
00:08:35,867 --> 00:08:36,867
I did not!

105
00:08:36,967 --> 00:08:39,100
Anyway, I don't see
why you care so much.

106
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,567
I mean, you should
be happy for me.

107
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:41,967
I am happy for you!

108
00:08:42,067 --> 00:08:43,233
You know, I'm just
trying to shake you

109
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,333
out of your domestic stupor.

110
00:08:45,433 --> 00:08:46,667
How can you live with this girl?

111
00:08:46,767 --> 00:08:48,333
You can't even get her
bra off during sex.

112
00:08:51,433 --> 00:08:54,667
[moaning]

113
00:09:14,233 --> 00:09:15,867
You guys are so cute.

114
00:09:21,767 --> 00:09:23,600
Are you sure he didn't call?

115
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,067
Yes.

116
00:09:25,167 --> 00:09:27,467
He was supposed to call
with the tour dates.

117
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,733
I told him I didn't want
to start on the East coast.

118
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,700
My following is in the Midwest.

119
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,833
Johnny, your following is
right here in this kitchen.

120
00:09:33,933 --> 00:09:36,500
Oh, Wiley, go sit down.

121
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,533
Oh my god, this smells great.

122
00:09:39,633 --> 00:09:41,400
That's the advantages of
living with a, you know,

123
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,200
a vet student.

124
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,267
You get fresh meats.

125
00:09:43,367 --> 00:09:44,067
ANNIE: Ha.

126
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:45,100
This smells incredible.

127
00:09:47,933 --> 00:09:49,233
Mm.

128
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:52,267
Oh my god, this is exactly
how mama used to make it.

129
00:09:52,367 --> 00:09:53,367
Mama?

130
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:55,067
What are we, in the
"Sound of Music"?

131
00:09:55,167 --> 00:09:56,867
She calls her mother "mama."

132
00:09:56,967 --> 00:09:57,933
I hate the Sound of Music.

133
00:09:58,033 --> 00:09:59,233
You know, it's the
one movie that makes

134
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:00,633
me want to root for the Nazis.

135
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:03,233
I'd like to push Sandy Duncan
right off one of those hills.

136
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,633
Oh no, no, you
mean Julie Andrews.

137
00:10:04,733 --> 00:10:05,833
Even worse.

138
00:10:05,933 --> 00:10:07,300
You know, that is so
funny, because I would

139
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,767
think you would love musicals.

140
00:10:09,867 --> 00:10:12,667
Oh, that reminds me.

141
00:10:12,767 --> 00:10:14,533
I think I found a
great guy for you.

142
00:10:14,633 --> 00:10:15,900
I think you'd like him.

143
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:23,133
Yeah, I work with him at the
vet school and he is so funny!

144
00:10:23,233 --> 00:10:25,100
His name is Rajneesh.

145
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,233
And actually, his
English is quite good.

146
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:29,033
Uh huh.

147
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,267
I am not going out with
an Indian named Rajneesh.

148
00:10:36,367 --> 00:10:37,267
Shh!

149
00:10:37,367 --> 00:10:38,633
Keep your voice down.

150
00:10:38,733 --> 00:10:40,533
(INDIAN ACCENT) You are very
[inaudible], just like my cow,

151
00:10:40,633 --> 00:10:41,900
thank you very much.

152
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,900
Shh, that's so offensive, God.

153
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,700
And they don't
use toilet paper.

154
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,600
Would you shut up?

155
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,867
Look, Johnny.

156
00:10:48,967 --> 00:10:51,767
Indians do not use toilet paper.

157
00:10:51,867 --> 00:10:53,800
I'm very open to other
cultures, it just so happens

158
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,800
they don't use toilet paper.

159
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,800
Yeah, right, what do they do?

160
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,233
Scoot along the carpet?

161
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:59,533
They use their left hand
and a bucket of water.

162
00:10:59,633 --> 00:11:00,867
Ugh, you are so disgusting.

163
00:11:00,967 --> 00:11:04,800
Look, just don't discuss
my sex life with your wife.

164
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,233
She's not my wife, and
don't call her that.

165
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,333
Well what about that attack?

166
00:11:08,433 --> 00:11:09,833
I would think that you
would love musicals,

167
00:11:09,933 --> 00:11:12,667
you know, what was that about?

168
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,267
I am just so sick of this.

169
00:11:14,367 --> 00:11:16,333
Sex is so useless.

170
00:11:16,433 --> 00:11:18,700
Fags, ugh, I just want
to go out and dance.

171
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,333
You know, when I'm on the dance
floor, I feel so free, so wild.

172
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:24,533
Wait, what color are you?

173
00:11:24,633 --> 00:11:25,467
I'm red.

174
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,267
I'm red!

175
00:11:26,367 --> 00:11:28,033
No I'm red.

176
00:11:28,133 --> 00:11:30,400
Shit!

177
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,133
Anyway, what do
you know about fags?

178
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,867
You run the minute you see one.

179
00:11:33,967 --> 00:11:36,467
Well you would too
if you read this.

180
00:11:36,567 --> 00:11:39,633
"The homosexual must
endlessly scavenge

181
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:43,067
city streets for the one
penis that satisfies him.

182
00:11:43,167 --> 00:11:46,967
Tragically, he will
never find this penis

183
00:11:47,067 --> 00:11:48,700
because it doesn't exist.

184
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,833
This formula is futile.

185
00:11:50,933 --> 00:11:54,967
One penis plus one
penis equals failure.

186
00:11:55,067 --> 00:12:00,567
The homosexual is condemned
to roam from penis to penis

That's it.

That's what I have to
look forward to, Johnny.

191
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,233
Johnny, why do we
have to do this?

192
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:19,033
Can't we just go to bed?

193
00:12:19,133 --> 00:12:20,100
I'm tired.

194
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,833
It's important to
live out our fantasies.

195
00:12:21,933 --> 00:12:22,667
Oh hey, hey, hey.

196
00:12:22,767 --> 00:12:24,300
This is your fantasy, not mine.

Look, try it on.

00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,100
I promise if you don't like
it, I'll take it off you.

199
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:28,900
Very funny.

Oh my God.

I'm taking this off.

206
00:13:26,433 --> 00:13:27,133
No!

207
00:13:32,433 --> 00:13:36,833

Annie is safe with Johnny.

Oh Johnny, does it
have to be so loud?

212
00:13:57,667 --> 00:14:01,933
I'm swinging through the
vine with you on my shoulder!

213

Oh, Johnny, I can't hear!

214
00:14:04,033 --> 00:14:05,433
Can you turn it down?

215
00:14:05,533 --> 00:14:07,433
Oh no, look, you're
scaring the bird.

216
00:14:07,533 --> 00:14:08,433

I gotta-- I gotta
tell you something.

I went into a-- a

-You went to a gay bar?
-Shh!

224
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:56,967
It wasn't a gay bar!

225
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,867
(WHISPERING) It was a gay bar.

226
00:16:01,967 --> 00:16:03,333
So what happened?

227
00:16:03,433 --> 00:16:05,300
What do you mean,
what happened?

228
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,667
Nothing happened.

229
00:16:06,767 --> 00:16:08,200
What was it like in there?

230
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,433
How would I know what
it was like in there?

231
00:16:10,533 --> 00:16:11,600
You were there!

232
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,067
I was not there!

00:16:14,167 --> 00:16:15,733
I didn't go in.

You didn't go inside?

No, I didn't go inside!

236

Why?

237
00:16:21,233 --> 00:16:22,733
Look, I'm not going
to go into a gay bar.

238
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:25,633
It was like an audition for
the Village People in there.

Why would I go into a gay bar?

240

talking about it

Don't you people realize
that all relationships

Johnny, the guy
looked like he had

375
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:32,967
paste stuffed up one nostril.

376
00:22:33,067 --> 00:22:33,933
How would you know?

377
00:22:34,033 --> 00:22:35,867
You hardly even
looked at the guy.

378
00:22:35,967 --> 00:22:37,900
I didn't have a chance
when you were so intriguing.

379
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,867
What is that supposed to mean?

380
00:22:40,967 --> 00:22:42,400
I thought you were
gonna ask the waiter

381
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,433
to wheel in a grand piano.

382
00:22:44,533 --> 00:22:45,800
That's ridiculous.

383
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,667
You know, I tried to get you
involved in the conversation,

384
00:22:47,767 --> 00:22:51,200
but you sat there
sulking the whole time.

385
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,133
I was not sulking.

386
00:22:57,267 --> 00:22:58,667
The whole thing
was just so boring.

387
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,500
Want some?

388
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,300
No.

389
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,767
Hey Wiley.

390
00:23:06,867 --> 00:23:08,367
You think maybe the
reason you're so depressed

391
00:23:08,467 --> 00:23:10,600
is cause you smoke too much pot?

392
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,300
I'm not depressed.

393
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,400
You think I'm depressed?

394
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,467
Annie thinks you're depressed.

395
00:23:14,567 --> 00:23:15,833
Well what does she know?

396
00:23:15,933 --> 00:23:18,433
Just because I hate everybody
doesn't mean I'm depressed.

397
00:23:18,533 --> 00:23:19,567
I'm just being realistic.

398
00:23:19,667 --> 00:23:20,833
Jesus, listen to you.

399
00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:22,633
Do you really hate everybody?

400
00:23:22,733 --> 00:23:24,733
Why shouldn't I?

401
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:26,400
I-- I'm being half serious here.

402

I mean, I'm sick of people.

I'm sick of myself.

404
00:23:29,567 --> 00:23:31,367
I hate being weak.

405
00:23:31,467 --> 00:23:33,333
I feel that if I
get close to girls,

406
00:23:33,433 --> 00:23:34,767
they're going to want
to go to bed with me.

407
00:23:34,867 --> 00:23:37,833
If I get close to guys, they're
going to think I'm a homo.

408
00:23:37,933 --> 00:23:39,000
I thought you were a homo.

409
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,700
That has not been proven yet!

410
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,133
And I don't want to get AIDS.

411
00:23:43,233 --> 00:23:44,467
It's not one of my
career goals to end

up with a horrific disease.

How could you
possibly get AIDS?

On the left, that's the blonde.

And on the right,
that's the dog.

But what's that--
what's that ball?

423
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,400
That's the scarab, Johnny.

Mrs. Saberman said.

mother's a shark.

the problem of chafing.

those things, because--

Oh, you are so
hard on yourself.

No, we didn't fight.

00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,567
We were very open
with each other.

527
00:31:28,667 --> 00:31:31,733
Then I left and I came here.

528
00:31:31,833 --> 00:31:33,800
She just needs some time
to get her head together.

He canceled.

546

He canceled?

547
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,000
He canceled!

548
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,300
But that's impossible!

549
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,867
The-- the tour starts
in three weeks.

550
00:32:18,967 --> 00:32:20,533
Why didn't you let
me talk to him.

551
00:32:20,633 --> 00:32:21,733
You were in the shower!

552
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:23,367
Yeah, he said something
about the guys from Geffen

553
00:32:23,467 --> 00:32:27,967
couldn't make it in til
tomorrow or the next day.

554
00:32:28,067 --> 00:32:29,267
That's totally normal.

555
00:32:32,067 --> 00:32:33,400
Murray must be
having more trouble

556
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:37,100
hammering out the liability
question than he thought.

557
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,900
[laughing]

558
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,300
This is so typical of
the music industry.

559
00:32:45,767 --> 00:32:51,100
[phone ringing]

560
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,633
Hey, slow down.

561
00:32:52,733 --> 00:32:56,167
I can't-- I can't understand
a word you're saying.

562
00:32:56,267 --> 00:32:59,867
All right, I'll be right there.

563
00:32:59,967 --> 00:33:00,867
I can't--

564
00:33:00,967 --> 00:33:02,367
Oh my God, be careful!

565
00:33:02,467 --> 00:33:03,300
Oh, just grab it!

566
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,367
Oh, you're hitting it too hard!

567
00:33:04,467 --> 00:33:06,333
Oh, shit.

568
00:33:06,433 --> 00:33:08,833
How'd it-- how'd it
get out of the cage?

569
00:33:08,933 --> 00:33:10,500
I was trying to put
a splint on its wing.

570
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,300
Look out!

571
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,767
[shouting]

572
00:33:19,833 --> 00:33:21,733
Oh my God!

573
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,233
I just stunned it.

574
00:33:23,333 --> 00:33:24,733
Oh my God!

575
00:33:24,833 --> 00:33:26,667
I think it's just stunned.

576
00:33:26,767 --> 00:33:29,167
[crying]

577
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:38,600
Don't touch me.

578
00:33:44,167 --> 00:33:45,500
I told you it was a mistake.

579
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,667
I mean, she's a moody,
demanding vivisectionist.

580
00:33:48,767 --> 00:33:50,133
Wait a second, I'm
the monster here.

581
00:33:50,233 --> 00:33:53,133
I'm gradually slaughtering
all of her animals.

582
00:33:53,233 --> 00:33:54,267
You killed one bird.

583
00:33:54,367 --> 00:33:56,900
Now that's a start, but
it's not nearly enough.

584
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,300
You should just ask
her to move out.

585
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,033
I should asked her to move out?

586
00:34:01,133 --> 00:34:03,100
She should ask me to move out!

587
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,900
You've gotta take
care of your own life.

588
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Hey, my life is fine!

589
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,467
I'm leaving you.

590
00:34:11,567 --> 00:34:13,333
What do you mean,
you're leaving me?

591
00:34:13,433 --> 00:34:17,367
Johnny, it's just-- I don't
think it's working out.

592
00:34:17,467 --> 00:34:19,300
Of course it's working out--

593
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,800
No.

594
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:23,167
I think this is best.

595
00:34:23,267 --> 00:34:26,600
What's best?

596
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,567
Going away for a little while?

597
00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:29,433
I'm moving out.

598
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:37,300
You can't-- can't
just leave on a whim.

599
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,333
You've gotta have a plan!

600
00:34:39,433 --> 00:34:42,667
You've gotta map things out!

601
00:34:42,767 --> 00:34:44,700
You've gotta think
things through before you

602
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,367
just decide to move out.

603
00:34:48,467 --> 00:34:50,467
I'm staying with
Elena til Friday.

604
00:34:50,567 --> 00:34:52,467
Her brother's picking
up my stuff on Saturday.

605
00:34:52,567 --> 00:34:56,900
And then I'm subletting
this place until spring.

606
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,000
How could you be so
methodical about this?

607
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,200
This is our life
you're talking about.

608
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,467
Can we please not talk
about this right now?

609
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,667
Just carry my trunk down.

610
00:35:18,233 --> 00:35:20,600
[heavy breathing]

611
00:36:12,533 --> 00:36:15,333
JOHNNY: I think it's
probably for the best.

612
00:36:15,433 --> 00:36:18,000
She saw me going places,
and she saw herself

613
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,667
staying in the same old rut.

614
00:36:19,767 --> 00:36:21,833
She just couldn't handle it.

615
00:36:21,933 --> 00:36:23,900
I don't know about that.

616
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,667
Hey, fuck you, you losers!

617
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,867
That's Veruca Salt. Don't look!

618
00:36:30,967 --> 00:36:31,667
So what?

619
00:36:31,767 --> 00:36:32,600
Just don't look!

620
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,733
Look, let's just
get out of here--

621
00:36:33,833 --> 00:36:34,533
No!

622
00:36:34,633 --> 00:36:35,533
Let's just get out of here!

623
00:36:35,633 --> 00:36:37,433
Now I gotta go in
because you looked.

624
00:36:37,533 --> 00:36:38,567
Don't go in there.

625
00:36:38,667 --> 00:36:39,800
You're going to make a
fool out of yourself.

626
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,067
Shut up, they're my friends.
Just shut up--

627
00:36:41,167 --> 00:36:41,867
You hardly know them!

628
00:36:41,967 --> 00:36:42,667
Stop looking.

629
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:43,800
Stop looking.

630
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:47,067
Hour-long psychedelic
jams that are gonna--

631
00:36:47,167 --> 00:36:48,167
they're no masturbatory--

632
00:36:48,267 --> 00:36:48,967
Stay out here.

633
00:36:49,067 --> 00:36:51,467
We've got the--

634
00:36:51,567 --> 00:36:54,367
Just-- shh.

635
00:36:54,467 --> 00:36:56,567
Jesus.

636
00:36:56,667 --> 00:36:58,567
Nina!

637
00:36:58,667 --> 00:37:00,900
Louise!

638
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,100
How you guys doing?

639
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,500
You know, I was walking
by, I saw you sitting here

640
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,467
in the window, and
I know it would've

641
00:37:06,567 --> 00:37:09,600
been really rude of me if I had
just, you know, not come in.

642
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:12,233
So how's everything going?

643
00:37:16,233 --> 00:37:19,000
I heard the album I liked it.

644
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,800
I did.

645
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:25,833
But what if on that
second song you

646
00:37:25,933 --> 00:37:28,700
dropped the vocals
down just a bit,

647
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,233
and you brought the guitars up?

648
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:33,667
The second song's a cappella.

649
00:37:33,767 --> 00:37:37,267
I-- I thought
you guys wrote it.

650
00:37:37,367 --> 00:37:39,033
Anyway, I, I have an album out.

651
00:37:39,133 --> 00:37:41,367
You might have heard
it, um, "Here's Johnny"?

652
00:37:44,467 --> 00:37:46,000
Well, it's just getting
in the stores now.

653
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:50,700
I mean, we're going the small,
limited distribution, um,

654
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,167
Murray Shuman, European,
Greenland thing, um--

655
00:37:54,267 --> 00:37:55,133
Excuse me?

656
00:37:55,233 --> 00:37:56,567
We were in the
middle of something.

657
00:37:56,667 --> 00:37:58,167
Yeah, we kind of need
to talk about some stuff.

658
00:38:00,967 --> 00:38:04,000
I know how it is.

659
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,667
I know how it is,
the-- the distractions,

660
00:38:06,767 --> 00:38:11,733
the people, the groupies,
you know, the pastarazzi.

661
00:38:11,833 --> 00:38:14,333
Would you please leave now?

662
00:38:14,433 --> 00:38:16,733
OK.

663
00:38:16,833 --> 00:38:21,000
I'll talk to you guys later.

664
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,500
[laughter]

665
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,000
Took your burrito?

666
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,967
What a dick!

667
00:38:26,067 --> 00:38:28,467
Let's get the hell out of here.

668
00:38:28,567 --> 00:38:31,433
[music playing]

669
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:34,000
(SINGING)Here's
Johnny, back again.

670
00:39:37,067 --> 00:39:41,700
Here's Johnny,
I'm my own friend.

671
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:57,667
[music playing]

672
00:41:10,033 --> 00:41:12,933
[phone ringing]

673
00:41:23,633 --> 00:41:25,267
Hello?

674
00:41:25,367 --> 00:41:26,500
Murray?

675
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,300
Murray.

676
00:41:33,167 --> 00:41:35,233
You're kidding!

677
00:41:35,333 --> 00:41:38,833
Oh, thank you!

678
00:41:38,933 --> 00:41:41,900
Thank you, Murray!

679
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,533
All right.

680
00:41:43,633 --> 00:41:44,667
All right.

681
00:41:44,767 --> 00:41:45,467
Talk to you later.

682
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,767
I gotta tell Annie.

683
00:41:59,867 --> 00:42:01,267
I gotta tell Annie.

684
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:13,400
I'm sorry.

685
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:21,400
[dog barking]

686
00:42:37,633 --> 00:42:39,767
I don't want any cool
effects or fancy edits

687
00:42:39,867 --> 00:42:41,600
or any of this MTV shit.

688
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,833
I just want a good video.

689
00:42:43,933 --> 00:42:46,200
So you really made it.

690
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:50,267
I don't want to jinx
anything, but it looks good.

691
00:42:50,367 --> 00:42:53,433
I would like to make a
toast to my beloved Cynthia.

692
00:42:53,533 --> 00:42:54,900
Stop it, Alistair!

693
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,100
Johnny.

694
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,500
May his success pave the
way for the rest of us.

695
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:02,233
You know, we really should
be toasting Murray here.

696
00:43:02,333 --> 00:43:03,833
I'm bored.

697
00:43:03,933 --> 00:43:07,533
Let's play "I never."

698
00:43:07,633 --> 00:43:09,567
No, I don't wanna know what
virtual strangers have done

699
00:43:09,667 --> 00:43:10,633
with their organs, you know?

700
00:43:10,733 --> 00:43:12,400
That's what talk shows are for.

701
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:17,500
Alistair likes it when I don't
shower for a couple of days.

702
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,500
OK.

703
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,900
OK, um, next question.

704
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:20,700
OK, I'll go.

705
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:21,500
I'll go.

706
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,800
Um, let's see.

707
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:25,500
Uh, I've never faked an orgasm.

708
00:43:32,933 --> 00:43:34,000
My turn!
Right.

709
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:34,900
Let's see.

710
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,567
Uh.

711
00:43:36,667 --> 00:43:40,100
I have never had sex with a man.

712
00:43:43,833 --> 00:43:45,300
Johnny, oh my God!

713
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,900
Annie, are you aware
of this little deviance?

714
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:48,700
Of course.

715
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,500
When was this?

716
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,300
It was nothing.

717
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,867
It was-- a long time ago.

718
00:43:53,967 --> 00:43:57,700
It was two kids rough-housing.

719
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,333
Where was it?

720
00:43:59,433 --> 00:44:00,167
It was in the shower.

721
00:44:00,267 --> 00:44:01,267
But you know, it was nothing.

722
00:44:01,367 --> 00:44:02,300
I shouldn't have brought it up.

723
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,400
It was-- it was stupid.

724
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,433
We just fooled around,
we didn't have sex.

725
00:44:05,533 --> 00:44:07,400
Alistair likes anal sex!

726
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:08,733
Shut up, Cynthia!

727
00:44:08,833 --> 00:44:10,200
Alistair says it's the best
contraception in the world,

728
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:11,433
don't you, Alistair!

729
00:44:11,533 --> 00:44:13,100
Yes, but we don't give
away all our little secrets,

730
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,033
do we now, Cynthia?

731
00:44:16,133 --> 00:44:18,767
What you laughing at?

732
00:44:18,867 --> 00:44:21,067
George and Martha over here.

733
00:44:21,167 --> 00:44:23,300
You're in a pretty good
mood for a homosexual

734
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,933
who's never had sex with a man.

735
00:44:28,667 --> 00:44:30,300
Well what about the
Englishman from Pittsburgh?

736
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,833
I am not from Pittsburgh.

737
00:44:32,933 --> 00:44:33,833
Yes you are.

738
00:44:33,933 --> 00:44:36,500
I left at a very young age.

739
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,433
About the same age you
discovered buggery, I believe.

740
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:42,800
What did you say?

741
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:44,800
I said about the same age
you discovered buggery.

742
00:44:47,533 --> 00:44:48,867
What's buggery?

743
00:44:48,967 --> 00:44:52,900
Buggery is a term used for what
you people call butt fucking.

744
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,833
[laughter]

745
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:04,067
Fuck you.

746
00:45:04,167 --> 00:45:06,900
Fuck all of you!

747
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,767
Wiley!

748
00:45:08,867 --> 00:45:11,700
I'll talk to him.

749
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,167
Wiley!

750
00:45:13,267 --> 00:45:14,133
Wiley!

751
00:45:14,233 --> 00:45:14,933
Stop!

752
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:25,367
[struggling]

753
00:45:25,467 --> 00:45:26,300
Get off me!

754
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,267
Ow!

755
00:45:27,367 --> 00:45:29,533
Ah, Jesus Christ!

756
00:45:29,633 --> 00:45:31,667
Wiley, what the
hell's wrong with you?

757
00:45:31,767 --> 00:45:33,167
Nobody meant to hurt you.

758
00:45:33,267 --> 00:45:35,000
Bullshit.

759
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:39,100
I'm so sick of your
stupid friends.

760
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,833
I don't want to be your
little sidekick anymore.

761
00:45:41,933 --> 00:45:44,400
I don't want to be C3PO.

762
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:45,200
You're not C3PO.

763
00:45:48,767 --> 00:45:52,400
You're the-- the most
important person in my life.

764
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,200
What about Annie?

765
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:01,167
Yeah, Annie's important.

766
00:46:01,267 --> 00:46:04,467
I mean but it's just
you-- it's different.

767
00:46:04,567 --> 00:46:06,367
Well I'm still sick of them.

768
00:46:06,467 --> 00:46:07,767
Look, forget about them.

769
00:46:07,867 --> 00:46:08,900
They don't care.

770
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,467
I mean, Alistair and
Cindy-- they're probably

771
00:46:11,567 --> 00:46:13,033
in a fist fight by now.

772
00:46:13,133 --> 00:46:16,000
And Annie-- come
on, she loves you.

773
00:46:18,867 --> 00:46:21,000
Johnny?

774
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:22,967
What.

775
00:46:23,067 --> 00:46:24,900
Do you smell something?

776
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:25,933
What?

777
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:28,133
Do you smell shit?

778
00:46:28,233 --> 00:46:28,933
Oh, shit!

779
00:46:29,033 --> 00:46:29,800
Oh my God!

780
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:31,233
[shouting]

781
00:46:31,333 --> 00:46:32,200
Ah!

782
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:33,933
Shit!

783
00:46:34,033 --> 00:46:35,633
Oh, God, it's in my hair!

784
00:46:35,733 --> 00:46:36,967
It's disgusting!

785
00:46:37,067 --> 00:46:38,967
I hate anything that
shits uncontrollably.

786
00:46:39,067 --> 00:46:41,667
Like dogs and babies.

787
00:46:41,767 --> 00:46:43,967
JOHNNY: Will you
hurry up in there?

788
00:46:44,067 --> 00:46:45,767
Hey, you want to come
in and do my back?

789
00:46:45,867 --> 00:46:48,567
JOHNNY: No!

790
00:46:48,667 --> 00:46:50,433
Hey, Johnny.

791
00:46:50,533 --> 00:46:52,033
JOHNNY: What?

792
00:46:52,133 --> 00:46:55,033
Did you really have
sex in the shower?

793
00:46:55,133 --> 00:46:56,167
JOHNNY: Oh God.

794
00:46:56,267 --> 00:46:58,367
No.

795
00:46:58,467 --> 00:46:59,667
Who was it with?

796
00:46:59,767 --> 00:47:00,633
JOHNNY: It was nothing.

797
00:47:00,733 --> 00:47:02,200
I shouldn't have
even brought it up.

798
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:05,300
Well, what happened?

799
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,800
JOHNNY: We were like 13 or 14.

800
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:09,100
There was a bunch of us.

801
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,533
We were playing Truth
or Dare or something.

802
00:47:11,633 --> 00:47:13,333
So Sean I got dared to go
to down to the poolhouse--

803
00:47:13,433 --> 00:47:14,133
Sean?

804
00:47:14,233 --> 00:47:15,700
Yeah, Sean.

805
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:20,267
So we got dared to go to the
pool house shower and, uh--

806
00:47:20,367 --> 00:47:22,433
Wait, Sean-- Sean Minos?

807
00:47:22,533 --> 00:47:24,867
JOHNNY: Yes, Sean Minos.

808
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:28,800
So we're in the shower and
we take off our bathing suits

809
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:32,100
and we start fooling around.

810
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,233
And in about 30 seconds we came.

811
00:47:34,333 --> 00:47:35,033
It was nothing.

812
00:47:38,567 --> 00:47:39,267
Sean Minos!

813
00:47:43,033 --> 00:47:46,867
It's all yours.

814
00:47:46,967 --> 00:47:48,767
Does it have a name?

815
00:47:48,867 --> 00:47:53,700
No, it's a laboratory rat.

816
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:57,000
And I'm going to kill it.

817
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:59,033
Oh my God.

818
00:47:59,133 --> 00:48:00,767
I can't do it.

819
00:48:00,867 --> 00:48:01,667
[phone ringing]

820
00:48:01,767 --> 00:48:02,967
I can't do it.

821
00:48:03,067 --> 00:48:04,500
Hello?

822
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:07,067
Murray.

823
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:08,167
Yeah.

824
00:48:08,267 --> 00:48:09,533
Uh huh?

825
00:48:09,633 --> 00:48:11,533
Uh huh.

826
00:48:11,633 --> 00:48:12,400
OK.

827
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:13,367
I understand.

828
00:48:13,467 --> 00:48:15,567
That's great.

829
00:48:15,667 --> 00:48:16,367
Great!

830
00:48:16,467 --> 00:48:17,200
OK.

831
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:18,333
I'll talk to you later.

832
00:48:18,433 --> 00:48:19,400
Good work, Murray.

833
00:48:23,667 --> 00:48:26,133
That was Murray.

834
00:48:26,233 --> 00:48:27,767
Label postponed.

835
00:48:27,867 --> 00:48:28,567
Again?

836
00:48:28,667 --> 00:48:30,600
I thought it was all set.

837
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:31,767
It is all set.

838
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:33,367
They just have to,
you know, finish

839
00:48:33,467 --> 00:48:35,967
hammering out those details,
and the liability question.

840
00:48:36,067 --> 00:48:37,800
It's totally normal.

841
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:40,267
No, Johnny.

842
00:48:40,367 --> 00:48:42,667
This is not normal.

843
00:48:42,767 --> 00:48:44,367
Murray doesn't show up
when he's supposed to,

844
00:48:44,467 --> 00:48:46,200
and whenever you're supposed
to meet one of these guys,

845
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:47,533
they cancel.

846
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:49,667
Don't you think
that's a little weird?

847
00:48:49,767 --> 00:48:50,467
What are you saying?

848
00:48:50,567 --> 00:48:52,233
Murray's lying to me?

849
00:48:52,333 --> 00:48:54,267
Murray hasn't done
one thing for you.

850
00:48:54,367 --> 00:48:56,633
What are you talking about?

851
00:48:56,733 --> 00:48:57,933
Well, you paid for the CD's.

852
00:48:58,033 --> 00:48:59,400
You pay for the studio time.

853
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:01,200
He hasn't done a damn thing!

854
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:05,200
Murray Shuman got me
European distribution.

855
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:08,067
I'm already being test marketed
in Greenland right now.

856
00:49:08,167 --> 00:49:10,433
How do you know your
album is in Greenland?

857
00:49:10,533 --> 00:49:14,600
Because Murray told me.

858
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:16,600
Don't you think you should
check up on some of this work

859
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:18,900
he's supposedly doing?

860
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,533
Yeah, I should spy on
my friend and manager.

861
00:49:22,633 --> 00:49:23,800
That's crazy.

862
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:27,633
All I'm saying is, is that
it's your life, Johnny.

863
00:49:27,733 --> 00:49:29,400
Yeah, it is my life.

864
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:31,733
And I don't need you ruining
it with your paranoia.

865
00:49:31,833 --> 00:49:33,967
It's like you're out to get me.

866
00:49:34,067 --> 00:49:36,433
Where are you going?

867
00:49:36,533 --> 00:49:38,167
You don't want me
to succeed, do you?

868
00:49:43,067 --> 00:49:44,400
[knock on door]

869
00:49:47,367 --> 00:49:48,233
Hey.

870
00:49:48,333 --> 00:49:49,800
I gotta make a phone call.

871
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:54,300
All right, just don't
call long distance.

872
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,233
Yeah, right.

873
00:49:55,333 --> 00:49:56,033
Who am I gonna call?

874
00:50:04,233 --> 00:50:06,200
Yeah, operator.

875
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:07,400
I want to place a
call to Greenland.

876
00:50:10,767 --> 00:50:13,167
I can't believe you
called Greenland.

877
00:50:13,267 --> 00:50:14,500
I'll pay you back.

878
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:15,300
Greenland.

879
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:20,233
They didn't have them.

880
00:50:20,333 --> 00:50:21,333
It's OK.

881
00:50:21,433 --> 00:50:23,633
It doesn't mean anything.

882
00:50:23,733 --> 00:50:28,233
Yeah, I mean, maybe they just
didn't get there yet, right?

883
00:50:28,333 --> 00:50:30,133
Besides, you only
called one record store.

884
00:50:33,067 --> 00:50:36,467
Greenland only has
one record store.

885
00:50:36,567 --> 00:50:37,533
Oh.

886
00:50:37,633 --> 00:50:40,900
Maybe Murray isn't
being straight with you.

887
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,033
You're talking about
Murray Shuman here.

888
00:50:44,133 --> 00:50:45,967
Jesus Christ.

889
00:50:46,067 --> 00:50:47,700
Just bring it up to him.

890
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:48,600
Maybe it was Iceland.

891
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:53,967
Yeah, I will bring it up to him.

892
00:50:54,067 --> 00:50:56,800
Just as soon as we get signed.

893
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:59,733
[music playing]

894
00:50:59,833 --> 00:51:01,433
What is this?

895
00:51:01,533 --> 00:51:04,767
This is a record I bought
to make a move on this girl.

896
00:51:04,867 --> 00:51:07,833
I knew she was
gonna fall for it.

897
00:51:07,933 --> 00:51:11,233
I put it on, and I was
all ready to make a move.

898
00:51:11,333 --> 00:51:16,567
Then the first song ended,
and then the second,

899
00:51:16,667 --> 00:51:20,533
and then the third.

900
00:51:20,633 --> 00:51:24,500
By the time the album ended I
hadn't done anything at all.

901
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:26,300
She left.

902
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:27,900
So what happened?

903
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,767
Nothing.

904
00:51:29,867 --> 00:51:31,000
She had a boyfriend
two days later.

905
00:51:33,833 --> 00:51:34,933
It's typical.

906
00:51:35,033 --> 00:51:37,333
So typical.

907
00:51:37,433 --> 00:51:38,400
I blew it.

908
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:40,567
You didn't blow it.

909
00:51:40,667 --> 00:51:42,267
You just-- they hadn't
figured out women yet.

910
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:49,133
You can't let those
opportunities pass you by.

911
00:51:49,233 --> 00:51:51,567
You gotta just pounce on them.

912
00:53:17,233 --> 00:53:19,133
Sorry.

913
00:53:19,233 --> 00:53:20,300
I have to go.

914
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:24,600
Fuck!

915
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:39,667
Hey, uh, I got some,
uh, CD's on hold.

916
00:54:39,767 --> 00:54:42,233
Hey, Joe.

917
00:54:42,333 --> 00:54:43,033
Johnny.

918
00:54:43,133 --> 00:54:43,867
Yeah--

919
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:44,667
Yeah.

920
00:54:44,767 --> 00:54:46,433
Hey, congratulations.

921
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:48,800
I heard about your deal.

922
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:50,533
Here you go.

923
00:54:50,633 --> 00:54:51,900
That's great.

924
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,933
Boy, Jesus, things-- must have
really changed things, huh?

925
00:54:55,033 --> 00:54:56,333
Eh, I don't know, man.

926
00:54:56,433 --> 00:54:58,367
The only thing that's changed, I
had to add a second phone line,

927
00:54:58,467 --> 00:55:00,767
cause you know, all
the business calls.

928
00:55:00,867 --> 00:55:01,567
Oh.

929
00:55:04,733 --> 00:55:06,033
[door opening]

930
00:55:06,133 --> 00:55:07,133
Hi.

931
00:55:07,233 --> 00:55:07,933
Hi.

932
00:55:11,367 --> 00:55:12,067
Any calls?

933
00:55:12,167 --> 00:55:13,500
Nope.

934
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,600
Did Murray call?

935
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:17,833
Nope.

936
00:55:17,933 --> 00:55:20,533
I was hoping he'd call.

937
00:55:20,633 --> 00:55:24,233
I need to know the status
on the liability question.

938
00:55:24,333 --> 00:55:25,033
Well, he didn't call.

939
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,433
Maybe I should get
another line installed.

940
00:55:30,533 --> 00:55:33,667
You know, just for
the band stuff.

941
00:55:33,767 --> 00:55:38,833
Johnny, what's going on
between you and Wiley?

942
00:55:38,933 --> 00:55:40,433
Wiley hasn't
called me in a week.

943
00:55:49,133 --> 00:55:50,500
Why aren't you
returning my calls?

944
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:52,400
Would you stop stalking me?

945
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:53,933
Why aren't you
returning my calls?

946
00:55:54,033 --> 00:55:56,000
I think it's obvious, Johnny.

947
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:57,833
Because I won't sleep with you?

948
00:55:57,933 --> 00:56:00,700
Johnny, I don't want to
talk to you right now.

949
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:02,867
Look, you don't have to
sleep with all your friends.

950
00:56:02,967 --> 00:56:04,033
This isn't prep school.

951
00:56:04,133 --> 00:56:05,267
Oh, fuck you.

Where's Wiley?

00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:33,733
I don't know

958
00:58:33,833 --> 00:58:35,533
You're lying to me.

959
00:58:35,633 --> 00:58:37,467
I don't know.

960
00:58:37,567 --> 00:58:39,133
Where is he?

[music playing]

962

(SINGING)It's the
heart afraid of breaking

that never learns to live.

964
00:58:58,767 --> 00:59:02,967
It's the dream afraid of waking.

965
00:59:09,867 --> 00:59:12,267
Wiley, can we talk about this?

966
00:59:12,367 --> 00:59:13,067
Fuck you.

967
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:17,967
Johnny, you've been
avoiding me for days.

968
00:59:18,067 --> 00:59:19,133
What do you mean?

969
00:59:19,233 --> 00:59:20,500
Well, the only time
I see you is when

970
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:22,300
I happen to catch you at home.

971
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,867
You're avoiding me.

972
00:59:23,967 --> 00:59:25,400
That's impossible, Annie.

973
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:26,633
We live together.

974
00:59:26,733 --> 00:59:27,567
How could I be avoiding you?

975
00:59:27,667 --> 00:59:29,433
Well, Johnny.

976
00:59:29,533 --> 00:59:32,733
I need you now more than ever.

977
00:59:32,833 --> 00:59:36,233
The vet school's
having a talent show.

978
00:59:36,333 --> 00:59:38,933
I'm going to perform.

979
00:59:39,033 --> 00:59:41,400
I think I finally found a way
to combine my love for dance

980
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:44,100
and my love for animals.

981
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:44,900
I need your support.

982
00:59:47,767 --> 00:59:49,700
Johnny, are you listening to me?

983
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:50,567
Yeah.

984
00:59:50,667 --> 00:59:51,900
I support you.

You're not even here.

00:59:53,167 --> 00:59:54,067
I am here.

No, no!

00:59:55,367 --> 00:59:57,400
Maybe physically you're
here, but not emotionally!

989
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:58,700
Not-- not mentally.

991
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:07,100

It's OK.

It's OK.

totally honest with you.

Everything is happening so fast.

996
01:00:28,033 --> 01:00:34,400
My album, the tour, the
label, our relationship.

01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:36,033
I'm trying.

998
01:00:36,133 --> 01:00:40,200
Maybe not so well,
but I'm trying

999
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:46,500
to strike a balance between
our relationship and my career.

1000
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:55,100
What career are
you talking about?

1001
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:56,367
My album.

1002
01:00:56,467 --> 01:00:58,667
Oh, Johnny, your
album is a flop.

1003
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:04,933
My album is not a flop.

1004
01:01:05,033 --> 01:01:06,767
You sold a dozen copies.

1005
01:01:06,867 --> 01:01:08,133
Half of them have been returned.

1006
01:01:08,233 --> 01:01:09,100
It's gotten terrible reviews.

1007
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:12,333
It has no distribution.

1008
01:01:12,433 --> 01:01:14,667
Murray is
distributing my album.

1009
01:01:14,767 --> 01:01:16,867
Oh, Murray couldn't
distribute leaflets!

your phone calls.

Look, Johnny.

You don't have to do this.

1029
01:04:16,667 --> 01:04:20,033
I want to do this.

1030
01:04:20,133 --> 01:04:21,167
I made a big mistake.

1031
01:04:21,267 --> 01:04:22,333
It was really stupid.

1032
01:04:22,433 --> 01:04:24,033
I just want to forget
the whole thing.

1033
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:24,900
What are you thinking about?

1034
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:25,700
My mother.

JOHNNY (VOICEOVER):
It wasn't that bad.

1036
01:05:56,967 --> 01:06:02,233
There was something so innocent
about Wiley's clumsiness.

1037

WILEY (VOICEOVER): God,
I was good last night.

1038
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:06,567
I guess all that
practice really paid off.

1039
01:06:06,667 --> 01:06:08,033
I wanna tell him it was fun.

1040
01:06:08,133 --> 01:06:09,167
No.

1041

Great lovers never talk
about their technique.

1042
01:06:11,667 --> 01:06:14,567
I don't want him to
think I'm obsessed.

wonder what he's thinking.

God, I bet he's thinking
about it all the time.

I bet he wants to do it right
now, right on the table!

1058
01:06:47,367 --> 01:06:48,867
I gotta stop this.

1061
01:06:52,833 --> 01:06:54,300
Look, he's not your mistress.

1062
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:55,500
Just say something.

1063
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:58,067
Stew is great.

1064
01:06:58,167 --> 01:07:00,367
WILEY (VOICEOVER): Next time
I really want to hold back.

1065
01:07:00,467 --> 01:07:01,467
Make him beg for it.

1066
01:07:01,567 --> 01:07:02,267
Look.

1067
01:07:05,367 --> 01:07:07,867
We can't do that again.

1068
01:07:07,967 --> 01:07:09,333
No, no.

1069
01:07:09,433 --> 01:07:10,133
I agree.

1070
01:07:10,233 --> 01:07:10,967
I agree.

1071
01:07:11,067 --> 01:07:11,767
Absolutely not.

1072
01:07:21,333 --> 01:07:22,600
Johnny.

1073
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:25,600
If you never saw
me before, would

1074
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:28,700
you think I was attractive?

1075
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:30,167
Depends how many beers I had.

1076
01:07:30,267 --> 01:07:31,567
Ha ha ha.

1077
01:07:31,667 --> 01:07:34,600
No, if I saw you,
I'd definitely think

1078
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:37,100
you were interesting looking.

1079
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:38,367
That's not what I asked.

1080
01:07:38,467 --> 01:07:41,100
You know, would you
think I was attractive?

1081
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:43,267
Yeah.

1082
01:07:43,367 --> 01:07:45,433
Good.

1083
01:07:45,533 --> 01:07:47,100
So, what are we going to do?

1084
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:48,467
What do you mean?

1085
01:07:48,567 --> 01:07:49,867
I mean, what are
we going to do?

1086
01:07:49,967 --> 01:07:51,267
What are we going
to do about Annie?

1087
01:07:51,367 --> 01:07:53,400
What are you going to tell her?

1088
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:56,600
Why would I tell
Annie anything?

1089
01:07:56,700 --> 01:07:58,167
Because we're doing it.

1090
01:07:58,267 --> 01:07:59,967
Because we just did it.

1091
01:08:00,067 --> 01:08:02,400
We did not just do it.

1092
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:03,200
We didn't just do it?

1093
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:04,167
No.

1094
01:08:04,267 --> 01:08:05,167
Well, what would you call it?

1095
01:08:09,233 --> 01:08:13,867
Normal male bonding
that's a little more

1096
01:08:13,967 --> 01:08:16,333
advanced than normal.

1097
01:08:16,433 --> 01:08:17,533
Well, try telling Annie that.

1098
01:08:17,633 --> 01:08:22,233
Hey, just leave
Annie to me, OK?

1099
01:08:22,333 --> 01:08:23,100
Everything's fine.

1100
01:08:39,100 --> 01:08:41,000
[door slamming]

1101
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:42,867
Wiley?

1102
01:08:42,967 --> 01:08:45,600
Oh my God, Wiley, how are you?

1103
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:46,700
Fine.

1104
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:47,600
I'm so happy to see you.

1105
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:48,933
Sit down!

1106
01:08:49,033 --> 01:08:51,733
Me and Johnny, we were so
sad when you weren't around.

1107
01:08:51,833 --> 01:08:53,767
Well, I have my
own life, you know.

1108
01:08:53,867 --> 01:08:54,867
Look at you!

1109
01:08:54,967 --> 01:08:56,767
You look like you're
dressed for Mardi Gras.

1110
01:08:56,867 --> 01:08:57,733
This?

1111
01:08:57,833 --> 01:08:59,100
This-- my closet
light went out and I

1112
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:00,233
couldn't see anyone-- anything.

1113
01:09:04,767 --> 01:09:05,533
Are you seeing someone?

1114
01:09:08,033 --> 01:09:08,733
That's absurd!

1115
01:09:08,833 --> 01:09:09,533
Are you?

1116
01:09:09,633 --> 01:09:11,233
It's like, totally abs--

1117
01:09:11,333 --> 01:09:15,267
You are seeing someone!

1118
01:09:15,367 --> 01:09:17,333
Oh my God, no wonder
you haven't been around.

1119
01:09:17,433 --> 01:09:19,900
This is great!

1120
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,200
Um, shit.

1121
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:22,000
I have to go.

1122
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:23,667
Final dissections are today.

1123
01:09:23,767 --> 01:09:25,067
But promise me this,
I'm going to write it

1124
01:09:25,167 --> 01:09:26,467
down in my book for Saturday.

1125
01:09:26,567 --> 01:09:28,567
We are going to double date.

1126
01:09:28,667 --> 01:09:29,667
No, that can't--

1127
01:09:29,767 --> 01:09:30,833
I can't believe that
Johnny didn't tell me.

1128
01:09:30,933 --> 01:09:36,133
Wiley and friend.

1129
01:09:36,233 --> 01:09:38,567
Why didn't Johnny tell me?

1130
01:09:38,667 --> 01:09:42,100
Well, we are going to
have a talk about this.

1131
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:44,700
OK, wish me luck!

1132
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:45,700
Good luck.

1133
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:46,500
Thanks.

1134
01:09:50,267 --> 01:09:50,967
Go wake that guy up.

1135
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:00,967
Hey, it's like 60
degrees outside.

1136
01:10:01,067 --> 01:10:02,733
We should go to the park
or the zoo or something.

1137
01:10:06,267 --> 01:10:07,433
What time is it?

1138
01:10:07,533 --> 01:10:08,467
It's early.

1139
01:10:08,567 --> 01:10:11,333
Must me great to
sleep in a real bed.

1140
01:10:11,433 --> 01:10:14,400
Did Murray call?

1141
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:16,600
How would I know
if Murray called?

1142
01:10:20,567 --> 01:10:21,667
Ah, I gotta piss.

1143
01:10:34,167 --> 01:10:36,100
I can't go to the
park with you today.

1144
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:37,533
I got too much shit to do.

1145
01:10:40,467 --> 01:10:41,833
Hey, are Alistair
and Cindy here?

1146
01:10:41,933 --> 01:10:42,633
No!

1147
01:10:47,167 --> 01:10:50,600
I should call Murray.

1148
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:52,067
[door opening]

1149
01:10:54,633 --> 01:10:58,467
[music playing]

1150
01:11:16,233 --> 01:11:17,633
Johnny.

1151
01:11:17,733 --> 01:11:18,633
Annie.

1152
01:11:18,733 --> 01:11:19,533
Hey, I forgot my notebook.

1153
01:11:19,633 --> 01:11:20,333
I gotta go.

1154
01:11:20,433 --> 01:11:21,200
It's not in here.

1155
01:11:23,767 --> 01:11:24,467
Good luck!

1156
01:11:30,067 --> 01:11:31,467
I told you this
was going to happen.

1157
01:11:31,567 --> 01:11:32,900
I told you to say
something to her.

1158
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,033
I mean, how long did you think
we could keep us a secret?

1159
01:11:35,133 --> 01:11:37,333
We weren't doing anything.

1160
01:11:37,433 --> 01:11:38,433
What are you talking about?

1161
01:11:38,533 --> 01:11:40,467
We were practically
sodomizing each other.

1162
01:11:40,567 --> 01:11:44,333
Quit making it sound like
we're having an affair.

1163
01:11:44,433 --> 01:11:46,333
Well what the hell is it, then?

1164
01:11:46,433 --> 01:11:47,233
Nothing.

1165
01:11:47,333 --> 01:11:48,967
It's a mistake.

1166
01:11:49,067 --> 01:11:51,233
A mistake?

1167
01:11:51,333 --> 01:11:53,767
Everything between us
has been a mistake?

1168
01:11:53,867 --> 01:11:57,067
There is no us.

1169
01:11:57,167 --> 01:11:58,100
What do you mean?

1170
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:02,267
There is you, and there is me.

1171
01:12:02,367 --> 01:12:03,667
There is no us.

1172
01:12:03,767 --> 01:12:05,467
Of course there is.

1173
01:12:05,567 --> 01:12:08,100
Look, everything was a mistake.

1174
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:11,567
From the first time on, was
just one of those crazy mistakes

1175
01:12:11,667 --> 01:12:14,100
that friends make.

1176
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:16,900
Oh, OK.

1177
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,900
I see.

1178
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,200
Fuck you, Johnny.

1179
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:23,900
I gotta stop her.

1180
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,767
I gotta find her before she
jumps to any conclusions.

1181
01:12:26,867 --> 01:12:30,267
[music playing]

1182
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:46,833
Johnny, what are
you doing here?

1183
01:12:46,933 --> 01:12:48,967
I'm in the middle
of my dissection.

1184
01:12:49,067 --> 01:12:50,500
It was a mistake.

1185
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:52,000
I was helping out a friend.

1186
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:54,833
You know, it's like Tom
Sawyer and Huck Finn.

1187
01:12:54,933 --> 01:12:56,933
What are you talking about?

1188
01:12:57,033 --> 01:12:59,333
I'm not saying
it's Wiley's fault,

1189
01:12:59,433 --> 01:13:01,500
but you know how
manipulative he can be.

1190
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:05,200
What are you doing here?

1191
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:09,033
There is nothing
between me and Wiley.

1192
01:13:09,133 --> 01:13:13,233
It was a schoolboy thing.

1193
01:13:13,333 --> 01:13:16,433
What do you mean
a schoolboy thing?

1194
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:32,000
You come here in the middle
of my dissection to tell me

1195
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:34,700
you're having a gay
affair with Wiley?

1196
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:35,600
Shh!

1197
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:37,667
I never said anything about gay!

1198
01:13:40,367 --> 01:13:43,200
I don't believe this.

1199
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:47,900
Just-- just get out of here.

1200
01:13:50,933 --> 01:13:54,100
We can talk about this
like reasonable adults.

1201
01:13:57,933 --> 01:13:59,767
[door slamming]

1202
01:14:03,267 --> 01:14:05,567
OK, we'll talk
when you get home.

1203
01:14:29,033 --> 01:14:32,167
What-- what is happening?

1204
01:14:32,267 --> 01:14:36,033
What is happening with the tour?

1205
01:14:36,133 --> 01:14:37,867
With the label?

1206
01:14:37,967 --> 01:14:39,800
With the album?

1207
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:41,533
What is happening?

1208
01:14:41,633 --> 01:14:43,700
Where did you disappear to?

1209
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:45,033
I know what you thinking.

1210
01:14:45,133 --> 01:14:46,733
I know what you're
trying to do--

1211
01:14:46,833 --> 01:14:48,633
No, no, just, I want to
know what's happening.

1212
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:54,300
What do you mean?

1213
01:14:54,400 --> 01:15:00,167
You have been acting
very unreliable lately.

1214
01:15:00,267 --> 01:15:02,067
If you're acting
this way with me,

1215
01:15:02,167 --> 01:15:04,133
how do I know you're not
acting this way with the label?

1216
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:13,500
OK.

1217
01:15:17,067 --> 01:15:18,467
This is very
embarrassing for me.

1218
01:15:27,433 --> 01:15:30,300
So, why are you
showing me pills?

1219
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:31,100
Read it.

1220
01:15:36,267 --> 01:15:38,533
Prozac.

1221
01:15:38,633 --> 01:15:39,567
So, you're on Prozac.

1222
01:15:42,433 --> 01:15:47,133
Johnny, I've been diagnosed
with attention deficit

1223
01:15:47,233 --> 01:15:50,833
disorder and
depression, manifesting

1224
01:15:50,933 --> 01:15:52,800
itself in pathological lying.

1225
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:02,367
What are you saying?

1226
01:16:02,467 --> 01:16:05,200
What-- what are you trying--
what are you saying?

1227
01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:12,133
That the label, that the tour--
are you saying that everything,

1228
01:16:12,233 --> 01:16:13,367
everything was just a lie?

1229
01:16:16,233 --> 01:16:18,100
No!

1230
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:20,967
Most everything I
told you is the truth.

1231
01:16:27,067 --> 01:16:30,233
CYNTHIA: I am not fat!

1232
01:16:30,333 --> 01:16:31,200
No!

1233
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:32,267
ALISTAIR: We signed
an agreement.

1234
01:16:32,367 --> 01:16:32,967
Now get on the scale.

1235
01:16:33,067 --> 01:16:33,533
CYNTHIA: No, fuck you!

1236
01:16:33,633 --> 01:16:34,567
You're crazy!

1237
01:16:34,667 --> 01:16:35,667
ALISTAIR: What is
this-- what is this?

1238
01:16:35,767 --> 01:16:37,100
Fucking Cheetos?

1239
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:39,233
Cheetos under the bed,
really, that's really tacky.

1240
01:16:39,333 --> 01:16:40,500
CYNTHIA: Those are mine.
They're mine!

1241
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:41,467
No, they're mine!

1242
01:16:47,900 --> 01:16:49,100
Wiley.

1243
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:51,767
Thank God you're here.

1244
01:16:51,867 --> 01:16:53,433
I think Annie's a
little upset with me.

1245
01:16:53,533 --> 01:16:54,600
I didn't come to
talk you, Johnny.

1246
01:16:54,700 --> 01:16:55,767
I'm looking for my underwear.

1247
01:16:55,867 --> 01:16:56,567
Wiley.

1248
01:16:56,667 --> 01:16:58,100
My silk boxers.

1249
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:00,233
Wiley, everything's fucked up.

1250
01:17:00,333 --> 01:17:02,967
Well that's your special
touch, isn't it, Johnny.

1251
01:17:03,067 --> 01:17:04,100
What am I going to do?

1252
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:06,033
Oh, I'm so concerned about you.

1253
01:17:06,133 --> 01:17:07,233
Give me a break!
-Wiley, I--

1254
01:17:07,333 --> 01:17:08,267
I don't give a shit about you!

1255
01:17:08,367 --> 01:17:09,500
I did this all for you!

1256
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:10,333
Oh, fuck you!

1257
01:17:10,433 --> 01:17:11,500
Where the hell are my boxers?

1258
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:13,133
I don't give a shit
about your fucking boxers!

1259
01:17:13,233 --> 01:17:13,933
Give me my boxers!

1260
01:17:14,033 --> 01:17:14,733
Fuck you!

1261
01:17:14,833 --> 01:17:15,867
Give them back!

1262
01:17:15,967 --> 01:17:17,233
I threw my relationship
out the window for you!

1263
01:17:17,333 --> 01:17:18,367
Give me my boxers!

1264
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:19,833
I destroyed Annie for
you, isn't that enough?

1265
01:17:19,933 --> 01:17:21,500
Fuck you and your
stupid housewife!

1266
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:24,700
Fuck you, I'm sick of you and
your stupid fucking self pity!

1267
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:25,800
You're full of shit!

1268
01:17:25,900 --> 01:17:27,300
Give them to me,
you cocksucker!

1269
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:30,033
You fucking faggot!

01:18:13,167 --> 01:18:13,900
Those are Annie's.

1272
01:18:57,500 --> 01:18:58,967
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

1273
01:19:02,467 --> 01:19:04,300
Put the guitar down.

1274
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:05,967
Uh-uh.

1275
01:19:06,067 --> 01:19:07,233
Put it down!

1276
01:19:07,333 --> 01:19:08,333
Give me the hat first!

1277
01:19:18,633 --> 01:19:20,000
Give me the guitar.

1278
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:22,433
No!

1279
01:19:22,533 --> 01:19:25,967
Give me the guitar, and
nothing happens to the hat.

1280
01:19:26,067 --> 01:19:27,433
No.

1281
01:19:27,533 --> 01:19:28,433

[grunting]

1284
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:17,600
You two make me sick.

1285
01:20:25,633 --> 01:20:27,533
Stop it.

1286
01:20:27,633 --> 01:20:28,500
Stop it.

1287
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:29,300
Stop it!

1288
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:48,567
You're a fucking
asshole, Johnny!

1289
01:20:48,667 --> 01:20:49,367
Fuck you.

1290
01:20:49,467 --> 01:20:50,300
You two deserve each other.

1291
01:20:53,300 --> 01:20:55,367
You punch like a girl.

1292
01:20:55,467 --> 01:20:56,667
I'm leaving you, Johnny.

1293
01:20:56,767 --> 01:20:57,467
Good, leave.

1294
01:20:57,567 --> 01:20:58,533
I don't care.

1295
01:20:58,633 --> 01:21:00,867
Just get out of my
life, the both of you.

1296
01:21:00,967 --> 01:21:02,600
You're a loser, Johnny.

1297
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:04,967
Fuck you!

1298
01:21:05,067 --> 01:21:05,967
Fuck you!

1299
01:21:06,067 --> 01:21:07,200
Fuck you!

1300
01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:08,333
Fuck you!

1301
01:21:08,433 --> 01:21:09,833
ALL: Fuck you!

1302
01:21:09,933 --> 01:21:10,833
Fuck you!

1303
01:21:10,933 --> 01:21:11,833
Fuck you!

1304
01:21:11,933 --> 01:21:13,333
Fuck you!

[crying]

1308
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:50,200
DOCTOR: Your friend is going
to make a full recovery.

1309
01:21:50,300 --> 01:21:51,200
Oh, thank God.

1310
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:56,700
Oh, thank God.

1311
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:58,167
He's going to be OK.

1312
01:22:01,767 --> 01:22:03,167
God, I love that guy.

1313
01:22:09,767 --> 01:22:14,833
I think we just need a
break from each other.

1314
01:22:14,933 --> 01:22:15,633
Yeah.

1315
01:22:18,867 --> 01:22:19,567
I agree.

1316
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:24,867
We--we all just
need some time alone.

1317
01:22:29,333 --> 01:22:33,567
I think I'm gonna-- I'm
gonna move in with Elena.

1318
01:22:33,667 --> 01:22:35,533
For real this time.

1319
01:22:35,633 --> 01:22:36,500
That's a good idea.

1320
01:22:39,533 --> 01:22:43,633
I think we just all need to
go our own separate ways,

1321
01:22:43,733 --> 01:22:47,733
and whatever happens, happens.

1322
01:22:47,833 --> 01:22:48,733
Yeah.

1323
01:22:48,833 --> 01:22:49,533
Yeah.

1324
01:22:55,833 --> 01:22:57,333
Are you hungry?

1325
01:22:57,433 --> 01:22:58,933
I'm starving.

1326
01:22:59,033 --> 01:23:02,767
I haven't eaten all day.

1327
01:23:02,867 --> 01:23:04,067
Maybe we should grab a bite.

1328
01:23:08,367 --> 01:23:11,267
There is that Polish place.

1329
01:23:11,367 --> 01:23:12,967
I hate that place.

1330
01:23:23,233 --> 01:23:27,567
ANNIE: Well, what about that
new little Pan Asian place?

1331
01:23:27,667 --> 01:23:30,733
WILEY: I-- I-- I don't
like Pan Asian places.

1332
01:23:30,833 --> 01:23:33,000
I mean, if they won't tell
me where they're from,

1333
01:23:33,100 --> 01:23:35,433
I-- I'm not gonna-- I'm
not gonna eat there.

1334
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:40,233
JOHNNY: Well, how about tapas?

1335
01:23:40,333 --> 01:23:42,333
I mean, there's not a
lot to it, but, you know,

1336
01:23:42,433 --> 01:23:44,700
if you order enough--

1337
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:47,400
WILEY: I-- I'm boycotting
Spanish restaurants

1338
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:49,433
because of the Inquisition.

1339
01:23:49,533 --> 01:23:50,533
I just can't eat there.

1340
01:23:50,633 --> 01:23:52,500
JOHNNY: Prozac.

1341
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:54,033
WILEY: Not for dinner, Johnny.

1342
01:23:54,133 --> 01:23:56,800
JOHNNY: No, I mean, now
that Murray's on Prozac,

1343
01:23:56,900 --> 01:23:59,400
I really think things are going
to start happening for me.

1344
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:00,400
ANNIE: Well, what about pizza?

1345
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:02,167
Pizza always makes
you feel good.

1346
01:24:02,267 --> 01:24:04,000
JOHNNY: First of all, there's
no good pizza in Chicago.

1347
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:04,933
It's impossible.

1348
01:24:05,033 --> 01:24:06,400
WILEY: Johnny, one
week in New York

1349
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:09,267
and you come back an expert.

1350
01:24:09,367 --> 01:24:11,367
JOHNNY: What about
that place over there?

1351
01:24:11,467 --> 01:24:12,667
WILEY: No, I hate that place.

1352
01:24:12,767 --> 01:24:15,033
The waitress has an oxygen
tank that she wheels around.

1353
01:24:15,133 --> 01:24:17,000
ANNIE: That's not true.

1354
01:24:17,100 --> 01:24:18,533
JOHNNY: Look, I got a place.

1355
01:24:18,633 --> 01:24:20,400
What about that
all-you-can-eat Indian place.

1356
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:22,400
ANNIE: Yeah, yeah,
Indian sounds good.

1357
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:24,067
WILEY: No, I don't
want all-you can eat.

1358
01:24:24,167 --> 01:24:25,433
ANNIE: Well you don't
have to eat it all.

1359
01:24:25,533 --> 01:24:26,733
You just have to go there and--

1360
01:24:26,833 --> 01:24:28,600
WILEY: Yeah, but the food
is never as good at a buffet

1361
01:24:28,700 --> 01:24:30,000
as it is when you
just order a la carte.

1362
01:24:30,100 --> 01:24:32,167
JOHNNY: Yeah, but then
you don't have to tip.

1363
01:24:32,267 --> 01:24:33,933
Why not just go for chop suey?

1364
01:24:34,033 --> 01:24:35,833
ANNIE: Italian.

1365
01:24:35,933 --> 01:24:36,933
BOTH: Italian chop suey?

1366
01:24:37,033 --> 01:24:38,433
ANNIE: No, just Italian.

1367
01:24:38,533 --> 01:24:40,333
WILEY: No, you-- the
Italian place here,

1368
01:24:40,433 --> 01:24:41,567
it's owned by the mafia.

1369
01:24:41,667 --> 01:24:43,733
They serve you a
broken leg of lamb--

1370
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:47,700
JOHNNY: How about Mexican?

1371

[music playing]

1372
01:27:40,700 --> 01:27:42,467
JOHNNY: Good work, Murray.

1373
01:27:42,567 --> 01:27:44,000
Good work.
