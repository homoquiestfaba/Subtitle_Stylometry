to lease out this space

so that we can offer assistance
to travelers such as yourself.

01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:46,090
Because to be honest,

371
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:48,971
I really don't know
what's fashionable or not.

372
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:52,004
So let me know what you see.

374
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:59,769
I'm sure they'll let you
leave the blanket here.

Let's try this one.

376
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:31,610
It looks good.

377
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:42,730
Okay.

378
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:44,484
Seems it's not too tight.

379
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:00,811
Okay.

380
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:05,248
Where's your... right there?

381
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:09,168
That's where your toe is.
It should be fine.

382
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:34,090
What'd you do that for?

383
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:39,840
You said you help me.

384
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:45,085
Well, yeah, but not like that.

and that's all.

together.

388
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:04,682
Well, no, you got me all wrong.

389
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:06,604
I mean, I have a wife and two kids,

390
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:11,288
I mean, I'm just trying to help you.

391
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:13,403
And the treasure's not real.

392
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:16,769
It's just a regular, normal movie,

393
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:18,081
and that's it.

394
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:22,801
It's fake, totally fake.

395
01:24:25,720 --> 01:24:27,882
It's not fake!

396
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:32,210
Wait. Just... will you listen to me?

397
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:33,964
Let me help you here!

398
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:47,764
Shit.

399
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:52,682
