00:00:46,872 --> 00:00:48,613
So, tell me
again why I'm here.

Neighbors
complained, said they

4
00:00:50,093 --> 00:00:51,573
heard crying and screaming.

5
00:00:51,703 --> 00:00:53,183
Seems like it could
be an ongoing thing.

6
00:00:53,314 --> 00:00:54,315
What do you
think, child abuse?

7
00:00:54,445 --> 00:00:56,012
Could be.
That's why I'm here.

8
00:01:00,495 --> 00:01:01,235
That's not a good sign.

I'm here with child services.

12
00:01:21,777 --> 00:01:22,517
Open up.

13
00:01:29,654 --> 00:01:30,568
Were coming in.

14
00:01:35,617 --> 00:01:36,444
After you.

15
00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:50,980
Hello.

16
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:51,850
Anybody home?

17
00:02:21,619 --> 00:02:25,449
I think I like
the office better.

18
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,974
This is nothing.

19
00:02:29,105 --> 00:02:30,672
Get out!
Get off!

20
00:02:30,802 --> 00:02:31,629
All right, freeze, lady.

21
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,588
Stay down.

22
00:02:33,718 --> 00:02:34,980
Get out of my house.

23
00:02:35,111 --> 00:02:36,765
Don't you dare take my
family away from me.

24
00:02:36,895 --> 00:02:38,070
You get out!

25
00:02:38,201 --> 00:02:39,811
Check out the
rest of the house.

26
00:02:39,942 --> 00:02:42,074
There could be a child in here.

27
00:02:42,205 --> 00:02:43,119
This is Jordan.

28
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,425
I'm on a domestic.

00:02:44,555 --> 00:02:45,904
I have a situation.

41
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,275
Stop doing that.

42
00:06:03,406 --> 00:06:04,407
We have to get up.

00:06:04,538 --> 00:06:05,452

That's great.

46
00:06:09,804 --> 00:06:12,850
It'll give us plenty of time totalk about options for sitters.

I hear someone.

00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,035
Good morning.

51
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:25,428
Is someone going
to make breakfast,

52
00:06:25,559 --> 00:06:27,212
or are we all going
to starve to death?

53
00:06:27,343 --> 00:06:29,519
Oh, you are such a
little drama queen.

That's me.

55
00:06:31,216 --> 00:06:32,000
You.

56
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,393
Oh, stop it, stop it.

57
00:06:33,523 --> 00:06:34,568
- Here's the spot.
- Get some breakfast--

Max, you're late.

61
00:06:41,575 --> 00:06:43,011
Any chance you could
take the kids to school?

62
00:06:43,141 --> 00:06:44,534
I have to be at work at 8:30.

63
00:06:44,665 --> 00:06:46,580
Besides, you don't haveto be anywhere till 10:00.

64
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:47,537
All right.

65
00:06:47,668 --> 00:06:48,930
Let's get a move on, then.

00:06:51,498 --> 00:06:54,718
We're interviewing

[school bell]

70
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,770
How come you drove us
to school and not mommy?

71
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,381
Because, buddy, mommy's
working, remember?

72
00:07:05,512 --> 00:07:06,556
I know, but why?

73
00:07:06,687 --> 00:07:07,949
Because mommy
wanted more money.

74
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:08,863
Casey.

75
00:07:11,561 --> 00:07:12,475
We used to have more money.

76
00:07:12,606 --> 00:07:13,911
What happened?

77
00:07:14,042 --> 00:07:16,348
Ah, Max.

78
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,611
I'm five years old.

79
00:07:17,741 --> 00:07:18,612
I have a lot to learn.

80
00:07:21,397 --> 00:07:23,094
You know, I've only
been back a few days,

81
00:07:23,225 --> 00:07:25,183
but it doesn't seem
like anything's changed.

82
00:07:25,314 --> 00:07:27,621
Except maybe the ads, whichhave progressively gotten

83
00:07:27,751 --> 00:07:28,491
worse, if that's possible.

84
00:07:31,407 --> 00:07:34,323
OK, Meghan, I've known
you since rush week.

85
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,021
What's wrong?

86
00:07:37,152 --> 00:07:39,241
I think Carter's
a little upset at me

87
00:07:39,371 --> 00:07:41,069
for coming back to work.

88
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,679
There, I said it.

89
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:43,985
So, if he would havepaid more attention to what

90
00:07:44,115 --> 00:07:46,335
was going on around
him at his old firm,

91
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,597
you wouldn't have had to.

92
00:07:47,728 --> 00:07:49,425
There, I said it.

93
00:07:49,556 --> 00:07:53,473
Shawna, why is it
so hard to be married?

94
00:07:53,603 --> 00:07:55,126
Don't ask me.

95
00:07:55,257 --> 00:07:57,041
I got divorced for a reason.

96
00:07:57,172 --> 00:08:00,915

Mrs. Eastman.

100
00:08:06,703 --> 00:08:08,618
It's Mrs. Berry, Max's teacher.

101
00:08:08,749 --> 00:08:10,751
Mrs. Berry, what
can I do for you?

102
00:08:10,881 --> 00:08:12,927
I think you should come
down here, Mrs. Eastman.

103
00:08:13,057 --> 00:08:14,145
Is Max all right?

104
00:08:14,276 --> 00:08:15,582
Max is fine.

105
00:08:15,712 --> 00:08:17,235
He's been disrupting
class again, though.

106
00:08:17,366 --> 00:08:18,759
How disruptive could he be?

107
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:20,804
He got into the glue again.

108
00:08:20,935 --> 00:08:22,153
When can I expect you?

109
00:08:22,284 --> 00:08:25,243
I'll be right there.

110
00:08:25,374 --> 00:08:27,637

112

Mel, it's Meghan.

113
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,948
Would you mind watching
Max for a little while

114
00:08:34,078 --> 00:08:35,340
until Carter gets
home from work?

115
00:08:35,471 --> 00:08:36,951
Of course.Bring him right over, sweetie.

116
00:08:37,081 --> 00:08:37,908
Thanks.

117
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,475
I'll be right over.

118
00:08:39,606 --> 00:08:41,129
Bye.

119
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:43,871
Max.

120
00:08:44,001 --> 00:08:47,091
Do you want to tell me whyyou put glue in Susan's hair?

121
00:08:47,222 --> 00:08:49,659
Max?

122
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:54,229
Mommy has to work now duringthe days, you understand that?

123
00:08:54,359 --> 00:08:56,884
So I can't keep running
down here every time

124
00:08:57,014 --> 00:08:58,015
you feel like acting up.

125
00:08:58,146 --> 00:09:00,104
But I miss you.

126
00:09:00,235 --> 00:09:01,758
Give it some time?

127
00:09:01,889 --> 00:09:03,064
OK.

128
00:09:03,194 --> 00:09:06,328
Oh, honey.

129
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:07,808
Come on.

130
00:09:07,938 --> 00:09:08,765
Come on.

131
00:09:13,857 --> 00:09:15,032
So what do you think?

132
00:09:15,163 --> 00:09:16,773
Well, it sounds
like it will be OK.

133
00:09:16,904 --> 00:09:18,296
I think that's what
you're looking for.

134
00:09:18,427 --> 00:09:19,384
- Great, thanks.
- Stan.

135
00:09:19,515 --> 00:09:20,385
Sir.

136
00:09:20,516 --> 00:09:21,386
Really is good to see you.

137
00:09:21,517 --> 00:09:22,562
Likewise.

138
00:09:22,692 --> 00:09:23,563
So I understand
you'll be bringing

139
00:09:23,693 --> 00:09:24,868
a little business our way?

140
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:26,391
As a matter of fact, I am.

141
00:09:26,522 --> 00:09:27,262
Good.

142
00:09:32,528 --> 00:09:34,835
Listen, Carter, I want youto see the account right away.

143
00:09:34,965 --> 00:09:35,792
Just tell me when.

144
00:09:35,923 --> 00:09:36,924
How about tomorrow?

145
00:09:37,054 --> 00:09:37,881
CARTER: Your office?

146
00:09:38,012 --> 00:09:39,970
Sounds great.

147
00:09:40,101 --> 00:09:40,841

148
00:09:40,971 --> 00:09:42,625

[door closes]

152
00:09:50,851 --> 00:09:51,591
Yes.

153
00:09:55,116 --> 00:09:56,247
Talk about the nick of time.

154
00:10:04,516 --> 00:10:05,822
Abby's going to
be here any minute.

155
00:10:05,953 --> 00:10:07,345
- I know, I'm hurrying.
- Who's Abby?

156
00:10:07,476 --> 00:10:08,259
She's a sitter.

157
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:10,174
She's coming for dinner.

158
00:10:10,305 --> 00:10:12,089
Sitter as in babysitter?

159
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,874
I don't like the sound of that.

160
00:10:14,004 --> 00:10:14,788
Just relax, buddy.

161
00:10:14,918 --> 00:10:16,311
I hope she's nice.

162
00:10:16,441 --> 00:10:17,791
Me too.

163
00:10:17,921 --> 00:10:19,531
I just don't want her
to think we're crazy.

164
00:10:19,662 --> 00:10:20,489
Don't worry, mom.

165
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,838
I'm not that crazy.

166
00:10:21,969 --> 00:10:23,666
Don't worry, we'll be good.Right, Max?

167
00:10:23,797 --> 00:10:25,276
- Right.
- Yeah.

[doorbell]

169
00:10:26,277 --> 00:10:27,975
I'll get it.

[music playing]

171
00:10:36,984 --> 00:10:38,333
Hi, I'm Abby.

172
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,203
What's your name?

173
00:10:39,334 --> 00:10:40,683
Casey Eastman.

174
00:10:40,814 --> 00:10:44,165
My, Casey, you're so pretty.

175
00:10:44,295 --> 00:10:46,384
I get it more from
my mom than my dad.

176
00:10:46,515 --> 00:10:47,429
You can come in if you want.

177
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:48,865
Dinner's almost ready.

178
00:10:48,996 --> 00:10:49,779
OK.

179
00:11:12,106 --> 00:11:15,152
So Abby, why don't you tellus a little bit about yourself?

180
00:11:15,283 --> 00:11:19,983
Well, let's see, I graduatedfrom Santa Cruz last spring,

181
00:11:20,114 --> 00:11:22,812
and I moved down
here soon after,

182
00:11:22,943 --> 00:11:25,336
and I've been doing
some babysitting jobs

183
00:11:25,467 --> 00:11:27,034
to pay the bills ever since.

184
00:11:27,164 --> 00:11:28,296
I'm not a baby.

185
00:11:28,426 --> 00:11:29,514
Of course you're not a baby.

186
00:11:29,645 --> 00:11:31,429
That's just a figure of speech.

187
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,604
I'll bet.

188
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,432
Max is our resident skeptic.

189
00:11:34,563 --> 00:11:36,130
You'll get used
to it eventually.

190
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,044
He's a brat.

191
00:11:37,174 --> 00:11:37,958
Casey.

192
00:11:38,088 --> 00:11:39,394
No, I'm not.

193
00:11:39,524 --> 00:11:42,223
He still wets his pants.

194
00:11:42,353 --> 00:11:43,093
I heard you.

195
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,623
Well, she's certainly
prettier than I thought.

196
00:11:51,754 --> 00:11:52,494
Really?

197
00:11:52,624 --> 00:11:55,149
I hadn't noticed.

198
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,544
You know, for a lawyer,
you're a terrible liar.

199
00:11:59,675 --> 00:12:01,111
I mean it.

200
00:12:01,242 --> 00:12:03,505
I liked her, and I'm hardlybasing that on her looks

201
00:12:03,635 --> 00:12:04,549
at all.

202
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,422
The kids seemed to like her.

203
00:12:07,552 --> 00:12:08,292
You got my vote.

204
00:12:08,423 --> 00:12:09,685
Move her in.

205
00:12:09,816 --> 00:12:11,121
Great.

206
00:12:11,252 --> 00:12:13,907
I will start cleaning
out your so-called gym,

207
00:12:14,037 --> 00:12:16,431
and I will have her
move in next week.

208
00:12:16,561 --> 00:12:19,564
And maybe you could fixthe drain in our bathroom,

209
00:12:19,695 --> 00:12:22,350
because I'm tired of
sharing with the kids.

210
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,264
Yes, dear.

211
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:33,883
It'll be weird, you know,having a stranger live with us.

212
00:12:34,014 --> 00:12:35,755
It's a little late
for that now, isn't it?

213
00:12:35,885 --> 00:12:37,191
I'm just saying.

214
00:12:37,321 --> 00:12:38,888
Big day, huh?

215
00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:39,933
She's cute, right?

216
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,586
You bet your ass.

217
00:12:41,717 --> 00:12:43,327
[laughter]

218
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:44,676
I just can't believe
how lucky you were

219
00:12:44,807 --> 00:12:46,156
to find a sitter so quickly.

220
00:12:46,287 --> 00:12:48,028
I know, you talk about
being in the right place

221
00:12:48,158 --> 00:12:49,290
at the right time.

222
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,508
Oh, and don't
forget, t-minus three

223
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:51,858
weeks and counting
till the biggest

224
00:12:51,988 --> 00:12:53,250
barbecue to end all barbecues.

225
00:12:53,381 --> 00:12:55,122
Jeez, you'd think it
was the second coming.

226
00:12:55,252 --> 00:12:56,297
It is a barbecue, Del.

227
00:12:56,427 --> 00:12:57,602
See, women just
don't understand.

228
00:12:57,733 --> 00:12:59,300
Men need to grill meat.

229
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:00,780
It's instinctive.

230
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:03,086
MEL: He's so full of it.

231
00:13:03,217 --> 00:13:04,044
MEGHAN: And here she is.

232
00:13:13,227 --> 00:13:15,272
ABBY: This is so beautiful.

233
00:13:15,403 --> 00:13:16,970
Thank you so much.

234
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,712
It's so nice of you
to do that for me.

235
00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:23,585
I want you to meet
Mel and Del Olson.

236
00:13:23,715 --> 00:13:25,587
They live next door.

237
00:13:25,717 --> 00:13:26,936
MEL: Hi, welcome to
the neighborhood.

238
00:13:27,067 --> 00:13:28,242
DEL: Welcome to
the neighborhood.

239
00:13:28,372 --> 00:13:29,112
Nice to meet you both.

240
00:13:29,243 --> 00:13:30,287
DEL: Nice to meet you.

241
00:13:30,418 --> 00:13:31,593
Let's get your
stuff inside, OK?

242
00:13:31,723 --> 00:13:32,507
All right.

243
00:13:32,637 --> 00:13:33,377
I'll get your bags.

244
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:38,905
About face.

245
00:13:43,561 --> 00:13:44,519
Hi.

246
00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:46,956
You can have it if you want.

247
00:13:47,087 --> 00:13:48,349
I'll tell you what,
sweetie, why don't

248
00:13:48,479 --> 00:13:49,916
you go finish it up for me, OK?

249
00:13:50,046 --> 00:13:51,265
OK.

250
00:13:51,395 --> 00:13:52,179
Come on.

251
00:13:57,924 --> 00:13:59,316
This is really nice up here.

252
00:13:59,447 --> 00:14:02,232
Thank you.

253
00:14:02,363 --> 00:14:03,930
This is Max's room.

254
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:07,498
This is mine and Carter'sroom, and here's the bathroom.

255
00:14:07,629 --> 00:14:08,848
This is my room.

256
00:14:08,978 --> 00:14:10,806
You can come see it
whenever you like.

257
00:14:10,937 --> 00:14:12,025
And this is going
to be your room.

258
00:14:15,245 --> 00:14:15,985
Everything's new.

259
00:14:18,901 --> 00:14:24,646
Carter set this room is a gym,but then never set foot in it.

260
00:14:24,776 --> 00:14:25,560
I'll let you get settled.

261
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,044
[doorbell]

262
00:14:31,174 --> 00:14:31,958
I'll get that.

263
00:14:32,088 --> 00:14:33,263
Thanks.

264
00:14:33,394 --> 00:14:34,786
- You all settled in?
- Yes, thank you.

265
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:35,700
Good.

266
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,666
Carter, I'm terribly sorryabout displacing your gym.

267
00:14:44,796 --> 00:14:46,189
Oh, that's all right.

268
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,061
I'm really haven't beenusing it that much anyway.

269
00:14:48,191 --> 00:14:49,149
You look like
you use it a lot.

270
00:14:51,934 --> 00:14:53,849
Hi, I made some brownies.

271
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:57,679
The kids are
going to love those.

272
00:14:57,809 --> 00:14:58,854
You must be Abby.
I'm Shawna.

273
00:14:58,985 --> 00:15:00,116
- Hi, Shawna.
- Hi.

274
00:15:00,247 --> 00:15:01,335
You want some coffee?

275
00:15:01,465 --> 00:15:03,163
Yes, please.

276
00:15:03,293 --> 00:15:05,165
Meghan sure is happy tohave some help around here.

277
00:15:05,295 --> 00:15:07,036
Amen to that.

278
00:15:07,167 --> 00:15:08,995
Thank you.

279
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,084
So Abby, where are you from?

280
00:15:11,214 --> 00:15:12,737
Up north.

281
00:15:12,868 --> 00:15:14,174
Your family still up there?

282
00:15:14,304 --> 00:15:15,915
It's just me.

283
00:15:16,045 --> 00:15:19,875
I was an only child, and myparents died when I was seven.

284
00:15:20,006 --> 00:15:21,790
You poor thing.

285
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,270
Alone at seven.

286
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,880
Casey's seven.

287
00:15:25,011 --> 00:15:28,231
Well, seems things haveturned out all right for you,

288
00:15:28,362 --> 00:15:29,711
all things considered.

289
00:15:29,841 --> 00:15:31,234
Yeah.

290
00:15:31,365 --> 00:15:34,237
I spent some time with areally nice foster family,

291
00:15:34,368 --> 00:15:36,979
and I worked my way through
college by babysitting,

292
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,894
which kind of led me here.

293
00:15:39,025 --> 00:15:41,679
That's great.

294
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,899
Well, I'd love to stayand chat with the ladies,

295
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:51,037
but I have a date tonight
and I have to get a wax.

296
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:52,690
Watch Shawna, shedoesn't pull any punches.

297
00:15:52,821 --> 00:15:53,909
Come on, I'll walk
you to the door.

298
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,738
- OK, nice to meet you.
- You, too.

299
00:15:56,868 --> 00:15:58,131
SHAWNA: Call me after your date.

300
00:15:58,261 --> 00:16:00,394
I want details.

301
00:16:00,524 --> 00:16:01,743
She's great.

302
00:16:01,873 --> 00:16:02,918
MEGHAN: Isn't she?

303
00:16:03,049 --> 00:16:06,008
And Casey loves her already.

304
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:07,836
Well, you made
the right choice.

305
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,056
I'm so glad to
hear you say that.

306
00:16:10,186 --> 00:16:11,492
She's got quite the
little bod on her, too.

307
00:16:11,622 --> 00:16:12,362
[inaudible]

308
00:16:12,493 --> 00:16:13,929
Yeah, I do.

309
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,409
All right, I'll
see you tomorrow.

310
00:16:15,539 --> 00:16:16,279
Bye.

311
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:18,281
Bye.

312
00:16:18,412 --> 00:16:21,632
I'll talk to you later.

313
00:16:21,763 --> 00:16:24,548
[ominous music]

314
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,736
This is such a pretty street.

315
00:16:38,867 --> 00:16:40,129
Isn't it?

316
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,523
That's where my friend
Jenny used to live,

317
00:16:42,653 --> 00:16:44,220
but she doesn't
live there anymore

318
00:16:44,351 --> 00:16:47,180
because her mom got tired ofher dad always going to Las

319
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:50,139
Vegas with his secretary.

320
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,533
That's too bad.

321
00:16:52,663 --> 00:16:56,624
Oh, that's where I saw Mr.Monroe kissing Mrs. Sorensen.

322
00:16:56,754 --> 00:16:58,191
Wow.

323
00:16:58,321 --> 00:17:00,715
And then that house wayback there is where I saw

324
00:17:00,845 --> 00:17:03,370
Mr. Miller kissing Mr. Bruger.

325
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,721
[laughs] This is quite theneighborhood you've got here,

326
00:17:06,851 --> 00:17:07,591
Casey.

327
00:17:07,722 --> 00:17:10,333
I'll say.

328
00:17:10,464 --> 00:17:12,379
Oh, Abby, this is Tom.

329
00:17:12,509 --> 00:17:13,641
He lives next door.

330
00:17:13,771 --> 00:17:15,121
Oh, Hi, Tom.

331
00:17:15,251 --> 00:17:16,731
Nice to meet you, Abby.

332
00:17:16,861 --> 00:17:17,819
What are you doing, Tom?

333
00:17:17,949 --> 00:17:20,387
Why are you being so nice?

334
00:17:20,517 --> 00:17:21,779
No reason.

335
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:23,259
Just riding my bike.

336
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,695
Abby's too mature
for you, Tom.

337
00:17:27,568 --> 00:17:28,351
Bye, Tom.

338
00:17:32,355 --> 00:17:35,967
Casey, I think you might
have hurt his feelings.

339
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:37,317
He'll get over it.

340
00:17:40,494 --> 00:17:43,801
[music playing]

341
00:18:05,997 --> 00:18:06,781
Thomas!

342
00:18:42,382 --> 00:18:44,210
ABBY: Just a minute.

343
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,168
[knocking]

344
00:18:51,869 --> 00:18:53,871
Hi, Mel.

345
00:18:54,002 --> 00:18:55,830
Hello, Abby.

346
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,267
I'd like to have a word withyou for a moment, if I could.

347
00:18:58,398 --> 00:19:00,008
Sure.

348
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,489
I have to go pick up Max andCasey from school in a minute.

349
00:19:02,619 --> 00:19:03,751
What's up?

350
00:19:03,881 --> 00:19:05,753
Well, in case
you hadn't noticed,

351
00:19:05,883 --> 00:19:08,495
our son Tom is
only 15 years old.

352
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:12,368
And my husband and I wouldreally appreciate it if you--

353
00:19:12,499 --> 00:19:16,546
if you didn't undress in frontof your open bedroom window.

354
00:19:16,677 --> 00:19:19,549
Oh my god.

355
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,204
I had no idea.

356
00:19:22,335 --> 00:19:24,250
Have you spoken
to Tom about this?

357
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,817
I can assure you he's wellaware of our disappointment.

358
00:19:26,948 --> 00:19:28,689
I'm sure he is.

359
00:19:28,819 --> 00:19:34,869
Well, like they say,
boys will be boys.

360
00:19:34,999 --> 00:19:39,090
You know, I neverreally liked that saying.

361
00:19:39,221 --> 00:19:40,179
Anything else
I can do for you?

362
00:19:43,356 --> 00:19:44,139
I guess not.

363
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,184
Great.

364
00:19:45,314 --> 00:19:46,272

366
00:20:14,691 --> 00:20:16,998
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

367
00:20:17,128 --> 00:20:18,956
There you go.

00:20:19,087 --> 00:20:21,959
[party chatter]

369
00:20:23,787 --> 00:20:25,572
How are you doing?

370
00:20:25,702 --> 00:20:27,269
We're good.

371
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,618
We're just gonna have a littlecooking lesson over here.

372
00:20:28,749 --> 00:20:30,620
Hello.

373
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:32,100
CASEY: Chef Abby.

374
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,450
We're gonna start
with a little tomato.

375
00:20:34,581 --> 00:20:36,235
CASEY: Tomato.
- There you go.

376
00:20:45,156 --> 00:20:47,507
Check out my
neighbor's new sitter.

377
00:20:47,637 --> 00:20:48,769
Whoa.

378
00:20:48,899 --> 00:20:50,814
She's hot.

379
00:20:50,945 --> 00:20:52,729
You talk to her yet?

380
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,165
Sure.

381
00:20:54,296 --> 00:20:55,602
Yeah right.

382
00:20:55,732 --> 00:20:57,081
Come on.

383
00:20:57,212 --> 00:20:58,257
All right, to Abby.

384
00:21:02,304 --> 00:21:03,131
Glad you could make it.

385
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,001
Thank you, partner.

386
00:21:04,132 --> 00:21:05,089
Mr. Walker.

387
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,962
Mr. Olson, go to see you.

388
00:21:08,092 --> 00:21:09,485
These are for you.
- Thank you.

389
00:21:09,616 --> 00:21:10,486
Well, that one's for me.

390
00:21:10,617 --> 00:21:11,531
All right.

391
00:21:11,661 --> 00:21:12,706
All right, enough chit chat.

392
00:21:12,836 --> 00:21:13,924
Where is she?

393
00:21:14,055 --> 00:21:18,625
She is right over there.

394
00:21:18,755 --> 00:21:20,888
Whoa, hottie.

395
00:21:21,018 --> 00:21:22,193
How old?

396
00:21:22,324 --> 00:21:25,022
She is too young
for you, you lech.

397
00:21:25,153 --> 00:21:26,372
There's no such thing.

398
00:21:26,502 --> 00:21:27,938
No such thing.

399
00:21:28,069 --> 00:21:29,113
Abby, come on over here.

400
00:21:29,244 --> 00:21:30,506
I'd like you to
meet Tate Walker.

401
00:21:30,637 --> 00:21:32,508
He's an old friend of
mine from law school.

402
00:21:32,639 --> 00:21:34,205
Abby, I've heard
so much about you

403
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,556
I feel like I know you already.

404
00:21:36,686 --> 00:21:38,209
Nice to meet you, Mr. Walker.

405
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:41,125
Pleasure is all
mine, and call me Tate.

406
00:21:41,256 --> 00:21:43,040
OK, Tate.

407
00:21:43,171 --> 00:21:45,913
So I understand you
went to Santa Cruz?

408
00:21:46,043 --> 00:21:48,785
Well, I hate to admit it, butmy baseball team used to beat

409
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:51,614
the hell out of you guys.

410
00:21:51,745 --> 00:21:54,225
Yeah, we pretty much sucked,but I was more of an Extreme

411
00:21:54,356 --> 00:21:55,705
Frisbee kind of girl.

412
00:21:55,836 --> 00:21:58,186
I believe that.

413
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,623
So, how do you like
Carpenter Falls?

414
00:22:00,754 --> 00:22:02,669
I like it just fine.

415
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:05,149
And how's the Eastman
household treating you?

416
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,020
I love it.

417
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,894
She loves it.

418
00:22:11,025 --> 00:22:13,854
Well, if you ever stop lovingit, I'm just a phone call away.

419
00:22:13,984 --> 00:22:15,377
She is fine, you big lech.

420
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,294
My best friend.

421
00:22:19,425 --> 00:22:20,208
Exactly.

422
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,209
Thanks a lot.

423
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,602
- You're doing OK?
- Yeah.

424
00:22:22,732 --> 00:22:23,559
School was fun?

425
00:22:27,171 --> 00:22:28,608
What the hell?

426
00:22:28,738 --> 00:22:29,478
Max.

427
00:22:34,614 --> 00:22:35,354
Max.

428
00:22:41,011 --> 00:22:41,838
Who was that boy?

429
00:22:41,969 --> 00:22:43,405
His name is Conrad Lucas.

430
00:22:43,536 --> 00:22:45,189
He does it everybody.

431
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,191
I don't care.
Go over to Casey.

432
00:22:50,064 --> 00:22:51,761
Max, are you OK?

433
00:22:51,892 --> 00:22:53,502
Hi.

434
00:22:53,633 --> 00:22:54,503
ABBY: Hey!

435
00:22:54,634 --> 00:22:56,549
I want to talk to you.

436
00:22:56,679 --> 00:22:59,465
[WHISPERS] If you ever touchMax again, [inaudible]..

437
00:23:12,565 --> 00:23:14,175
What did you say to him?

438
00:23:14,305 --> 00:23:15,176
Nothing much.

439
00:23:15,306 --> 00:23:17,308
Come on, let's go home.

440
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:20,268
[inaudible]

441
00:23:23,314 --> 00:23:25,752
Hey.

442
00:23:25,882 --> 00:23:28,015
Wait for me over there, guys.

443
00:23:28,145 --> 00:23:29,886
You threatened my kid?

444
00:23:30,017 --> 00:23:31,758
I spoke to Conrad, yes.

445
00:23:31,888 --> 00:23:34,369
Where do you get offtalking to my kid like that?

446
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,720
Conrad pushed Max
a number of times,

447
00:23:37,851 --> 00:23:39,505
and apparently
this happens often.

448
00:23:39,635 --> 00:23:42,508
Kids play rough sometimes.

449
00:23:42,638 --> 00:23:45,032
So do I.

450
00:23:45,162 --> 00:23:45,946
Now listen--

451
00:23:46,076 --> 00:23:47,948
No, you listen.

452
00:23:48,078 --> 00:23:50,298
The next time your littlebastard goes near Max,

453
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:56,696
I'm gonna skin him like arabbit, right in front of you.

454
00:23:56,826 --> 00:23:57,697
Got it?

455
00:24:03,267 --> 00:24:04,138
And I mean it.

456
00:24:17,194 --> 00:24:20,067
What's the matter, Case?

457
00:24:20,197 --> 00:24:22,286
Multiplication tables suck.

458
00:24:22,417 --> 00:24:24,288
Casey said "suck."

459
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:27,553
Thank you, Max,
but so did you.

460
00:24:27,683 --> 00:24:29,642
OK, let me see.

461
00:24:29,772 --> 00:24:31,861
It's not so bad.

462
00:24:31,992 --> 00:24:33,428
Look with the fives--
- Hi, mom.

463
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:34,342
Hi.

464
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,212
Hi, mom.

465
00:24:35,343 --> 00:24:36,300
Hey, what you doing?

466
00:24:39,739 --> 00:24:42,350
Multiplication tables.

467
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,178
Let me get changed, andI'll come back and help you.

468
00:24:44,308 --> 00:24:46,136
That's all right, mom.

469
00:24:46,267 --> 00:24:47,442
Abby's helping me.

470
00:24:52,055 --> 00:24:53,753
I was stuck on five times nine.

471
00:25:17,472 --> 00:25:18,212
MEGHAN: Excuse me.

472
00:25:21,432 --> 00:25:22,216
Hi.

473
00:25:22,346 --> 00:25:23,609
Hey, it's me.

474
00:25:23,739 --> 00:25:25,045
Good news, they settled.

475
00:25:25,175 --> 00:25:28,178
Let's go out and celebrate.

476
00:25:28,309 --> 00:25:29,658
That's nice.

477
00:25:29,789 --> 00:25:32,269
It's better than
nice, it's great.

478
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,575
Are you on your way home?

479
00:25:33,706 --> 00:25:34,663
Let's go out.

480
00:25:34,794 --> 00:25:35,925
Not yet.

481
00:25:36,056 --> 00:25:37,361
I'm having drinks
with some clients.

482
00:25:37,492 --> 00:25:38,232
It might be awhile.

483
00:25:41,844 --> 00:25:43,411
Carter?

484
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:46,153
It's fine.

485
00:25:46,283 --> 00:25:48,111
You need to do it.

486
00:25:48,242 --> 00:25:49,112
All right.

487
00:25:49,243 --> 00:25:52,115
I'll see you tonight.

488
00:25:52,246 --> 00:25:55,075
[music playing]

489
00:26:02,648 --> 00:26:04,650
Guess I'll celebrate myself.

490
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:07,087
Celebrate what?

491
00:26:07,217 --> 00:26:08,088
Oh, hey, Abby.

492
00:26:08,218 --> 00:26:10,351
Just a little victory.

493
00:26:10,481 --> 00:26:14,485
Got everything we askedfor in a nice settlement.

494
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:15,399
Where are the kids?

495
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:16,313
Upstairs.

496
00:26:20,535 --> 00:26:24,321
So, is this case a
big deal or something?

497
00:26:24,452 --> 00:26:26,933
I guess you could say that.

498
00:26:27,063 --> 00:26:29,022
More of a personal
victory, really.

499
00:26:29,152 --> 00:26:29,849
What do you mean?

500
00:26:32,982 --> 00:26:35,681
You see, I used to bea lawyer with a big firm.

501
00:26:35,811 --> 00:26:37,334
A big firm what?

502
00:26:37,465 --> 00:26:39,641
[laughs]

503
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:43,340
That's a good one.

504
00:26:43,471 --> 00:26:44,907
Sorry.

505
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:48,519
So, do you like being a lawyer?

506
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:51,522
I like it when it'sgood, but I guess you could

507
00:26:51,653 --> 00:26:53,655
say that about any job, right?

508
00:26:53,786 --> 00:26:56,353
Are things good now?

509
00:26:56,484 --> 00:26:59,530
Things are very good.

510
00:26:59,661 --> 00:27:02,795
When did you know you
wanted to be a lawyer?

511
00:27:02,925 --> 00:27:04,927
Ever since I can remember.

512
00:27:05,058 --> 00:27:07,016
Law school was no
picnic, but I managed

513
00:27:07,147 --> 00:27:08,931
to get a job in the publicdefender's office right

514
00:27:09,062 --> 00:27:10,716
after I passed the BAR.

515
00:27:10,846 --> 00:27:14,458
I worked there for a couple ofyears, and then a buddy of mine

516
00:27:14,589 --> 00:27:16,373
from law school, hebrought me into his firm,

517
00:27:16,504 --> 00:27:19,768
and it happened to bethe biggest firm in town.

518
00:27:19,899 --> 00:27:24,294
Worked my ass off, madepartner by the time I was 32.

519
00:27:24,425 --> 00:27:27,123
Then the roof caved in.

520
00:27:27,254 --> 00:27:29,822
What do you mean?

521
00:27:29,952 --> 00:27:32,389
Well, some of my
other partners, they

522
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,913
weren't such good guys.

523
00:27:34,043 --> 00:27:35,436
What did they do?

524
00:27:35,566 --> 00:27:38,221
They ripped off somevery rich clients of ours.

525
00:27:38,352 --> 00:27:40,267
And what happened?

526
00:27:40,397 --> 00:27:44,358
A couple of them
went to jail, and I

527
00:27:44,488 --> 00:27:47,056
found myself out of a job.

528
00:27:47,187 --> 00:27:48,623
But I started over.

529
00:27:48,754 --> 00:27:51,060
Tate and I started
up our own firm,

530
00:27:51,191 --> 00:27:55,151
and today is sort of a
turning point for us.

531
00:27:55,282 --> 00:27:59,895
Wow, congratulations.

532
00:28:00,026 --> 00:28:01,636
I will have thecontracts messengered over

533
00:28:01,767 --> 00:28:02,811
in the morning.

534
00:28:02,942 --> 00:28:03,769
All right, see
you later, Meghan.

535
00:28:03,899 --> 00:28:05,205
Good night, everybody.

536
00:28:17,173 --> 00:28:20,699
You should celebrate.

537
00:28:20,829 --> 00:28:23,527
I should.

538
00:28:23,658 --> 00:28:25,051
What about throwing a party?

539
00:28:25,181 --> 00:28:25,965
A party?

540
00:28:26,095 --> 00:28:27,009
Sure.

541
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,532
We could throw a cocktail party.

542
00:28:28,663 --> 00:28:29,795
It would be fun.

543
00:28:29,925 --> 00:28:31,144
Maybe.

544
00:28:31,274 --> 00:28:32,580
I might have to talk
to Meghan about it.

545
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:35,496
She might be too
busy to organize it.

546
00:28:35,626 --> 00:28:38,107
Although it sounds
like a great idea.

547
00:28:41,328 --> 00:28:45,680
Well, you always
have me, you know?

548
00:28:45,811 --> 00:28:48,335
I am getting old, Abby.

549
00:28:48,465 --> 00:28:49,423
No, you're not.

550
00:28:52,513 --> 00:28:54,036
I mean, we all get
old, but that doesn't

551
00:28:54,167 --> 00:28:57,257
mean we have to feel old.

552
00:28:57,387 --> 00:28:59,259

Hey, Abby, have you seen Tate?

745
00:39:32,457 --> 00:39:33,501
No.

746
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:35,068
I can't seem to
find him anywhere.

747
00:39:35,198 --> 00:39:40,203
I did notice him making
good use of the bar.

748
00:39:40,334 --> 00:39:43,685
Tell me about it.

749
00:39:43,816 --> 00:39:46,166

Well, no one's heardfrom Tate since the party.

753
00:40:41,134 --> 00:40:43,049
Should I be worried now?

754
00:40:43,179 --> 00:40:44,920
I can't understand it.

755
00:40:45,051 --> 00:40:46,226
Maybe we went to Vegas.

756
00:40:46,356 --> 00:40:48,446
You know how he gets.

757
00:40:48,576 --> 00:40:49,708
Good point.

758
00:40:49,838 --> 00:40:50,839
It's not like
him to just bail.

759
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:52,406
It's really weird.

760
00:40:52,537 --> 00:40:54,016
Look at that.

761
00:40:54,147 --> 00:40:57,063
They found a car in the lake.

762
00:40:57,193 --> 00:40:58,760
Wow.

763

It almost took his

Was that Tate?

Yes, it was.

Abby?

780
00:42:33,986 --> 00:42:35,291
Can I speak with you a minute?

781
00:42:35,422 --> 00:42:39,034
It's about your online profile.

782
00:42:39,165 --> 00:42:40,688
Can it wait?

783
00:42:40,819 --> 00:42:42,255
I promised Casey I'd helpher with her homework,

784
00:42:42,385 --> 00:42:44,692
and I just want to
get her going on it.

785

I can't get over howgood they've been for you.

00:43:00,795 --> 00:43:07,889
Well, I guess I justknow how to talk to kids.

789
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:11,023
So what was your childhood
like before your parents

790
00:43:11,153 --> 00:43:12,415
passed away?

791
00:43:12,546 --> 00:43:16,985
We were a happy family,
just like any other.

792
00:43:17,116 --> 00:43:18,944
Mom, are we a happy family?

793
00:43:19,074 --> 00:43:22,164
We sure are, sweetie.

that Abby's here.

Hi, Mel.

798
00:43:55,502 --> 00:43:57,330
You just scared the
dickens out of me.

799
00:43:57,460 --> 00:44:00,420
Sorry, I didn't mean to.

800
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:04,293
So, what did you want
to talk to me about?

801
00:44:04,424 --> 00:44:08,428
Well, I was looking
at some sitter sites

802
00:44:08,558 --> 00:44:10,169
for a friend of mine at church.

803
00:44:10,299 --> 00:44:12,084
Uh huh.

804
00:44:12,214 --> 00:44:14,260
And I came across
the site that Meghan

805
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:16,305
said that she found you on.

806
00:44:16,436 --> 00:44:19,613
And, you know, just for the heckof it, I typed your name in,

807
00:44:19,744 --> 00:44:23,878
and the computer came upand said "no profile found."

808
00:44:24,009 --> 00:44:26,664
And I was just wondering,
what does that mean?

809
00:44:26,794 --> 00:44:29,623
Oh, I always take my profileoffline when I accept a job.

810
00:44:29,754 --> 00:44:30,493
Oh.

811
00:44:33,627 --> 00:44:36,935
Is there anything
else you wanted to know?

812
00:44:37,065 --> 00:44:38,545
No, that'll about do it.

813
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:39,589
OK then.

814
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:40,503

[door creaking]

816
00:45:14,276 --> 00:45:17,497
So, uh, how do you likeworking for the Eastman's?

817
00:45:17,627 --> 00:45:18,367
I like it fine.

818
00:45:23,242 --> 00:45:26,419
Boy, my mom would kill me ifshe knew I was talking to you.

819
00:45:26,549 --> 00:45:29,074
Yeah, she doesn't seem tocare much for me, does she?

820
00:45:29,204 --> 00:45:32,904
She's a fruitcake when
it comes to strangers.

821
00:45:33,034 --> 00:45:34,644
She keeps looking you
up on the internet

822
00:45:34,775 --> 00:45:37,822
as if she's trying to uncoversome great secret about you.

823
00:45:42,478 --> 00:45:45,481
So my dad's taking me
driving later on today.

824
00:45:45,612 --> 00:45:48,963
Says if I do good, I can
take my test next week.

825
00:45:49,094 --> 00:45:50,660
Good for you, Tom.

826
00:45:50,791 --> 00:45:55,230
Maybe you and I could
go driving sometime?

827
00:45:55,361 --> 00:45:56,188
Yeah, maybe.

828
00:45:59,278 --> 00:46:01,541
Well, I got to go
check on the kids.

835
00:46:23,432 --> 00:46:25,391
You want to bring the kids?

836
00:46:25,521 --> 00:46:27,088
- Should I?
- It's cool.

837
00:46:27,219 --> 00:46:28,002

then shoes second.

00:46:42,712 --> 00:46:44,105
I guess not.

844

She looked like she coulduse a break, though.

How are you holding up?

846

miss your friend.

It's definitely weird.

Don't be sad, Carter.

849
00:46:58,511 --> 00:47:01,383
I'll be your friend.

850

How come mommy
didn't come, too?

851
00:47:04,734 --> 00:47:06,736
Because she went shoppingwith Shawna, dummy.

852
00:47:06,867 --> 00:47:08,738
Casey, that wasn't very nice.

853
00:47:08,869 --> 00:47:10,479
You should apologize to Max.

854
00:47:10,610 --> 00:47:12,264
- Sorry, Max.
- It's OK.

00:47:14,788 --> 00:47:15,528

are you gonna be?

Could be a while.

862
00:47:37,942 --> 00:47:39,726
Depends on how good
a driver he is.

863
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:40,945
I know how to do it.

back in one piece.

00:51:28,955 --> 00:51:30,739
[laughing]

920
00:51:33,264 --> 00:51:34,482
Stay for dinner?

921
00:51:34,613 --> 00:51:37,616
I am gonna stay for
dinner, absolutely.

922
00:51:37,746 --> 00:51:39,096
What are we having?

923
00:51:39,226 --> 00:51:42,055
I never know.

924
00:51:42,186 --> 00:51:43,012
Hey, honey.

925
00:51:43,143 --> 00:51:43,926
Hi.

926
00:51:44,057 --> 00:51:44,840
OK, OK, pay attention.

927
00:51:44,971 --> 00:51:45,928
Hi, guys.

928
00:51:46,059 --> 00:51:47,016
How was shopping?

929
00:51:47,147 --> 00:51:49,367
Not too shabby.

930
00:51:49,497 --> 00:51:52,109
Pretty cozy in here.

931
00:51:52,239 --> 00:51:53,458
I'm going to call Mel.

932
00:51:53,588 --> 00:51:54,459
She sounded--

933
00:51:54,589 --> 00:51:55,677
Weird?

934
00:51:55,808 --> 00:51:56,678
Weirder than usual.

935
00:51:59,768 --> 00:52:02,597
[phone ringing]

936
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:11,998
That's odd.

937
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:14,566
She never goes anywhere.

938
00:52:14,696 --> 00:52:17,656
Well, now who's
the nosy neighbor?

939
00:52:17,786 --> 00:52:19,092
I'm going to go
see what she wanted.

940
00:52:19,223 --> 00:52:20,137
Want me to come with you?

941
00:52:20,267 --> 00:52:22,051
- No, it's OK.
- Honey, you OK?

942
00:52:22,182 --> 00:52:24,663
Yeah, yeah.

943
00:52:24,793 --> 00:52:26,012
Well, you need any help?

944
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:26,926
It's OK.

945
00:52:27,056 --> 00:52:27,840
I got it.

946
00:52:35,413 --> 00:52:38,720
[doorbell]

947
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:48,643
Mel?

948
00:52:51,907 --> 00:52:52,691
Mel?

949
00:52:55,302 --> 00:52:56,085
Mel?

950
00:53:04,093 --> 00:53:05,660
Mel?

951
00:53:05,791 --> 00:53:06,574
Mel?

952
00:53:12,754 --> 00:53:13,538
Mel?

953
00:53:23,243 --> 00:53:24,026
Mel?

954
00:53:30,119 --> 00:53:31,991
[screams]

955
00:53:32,121 --> 00:53:32,992
Oh god.

956
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:40,913
Abby, please take the
kids and go upstairs.

957
00:53:41,043 --> 00:53:42,175
But dinner's almost ready.

958
00:53:42,306 --> 00:53:43,394
Just please do it, OK?

959
00:53:43,524 --> 00:53:44,308
Mommy, what's wrong?

960
00:53:44,438 --> 00:53:45,265
Come with me.

961
00:53:45,396 --> 00:53:46,614
What happened?

962
00:53:46,745 --> 00:53:51,837
Oh, Mel's had an
accident and she's dead.

963
00:53:51,967 --> 00:53:53,099
ABBY: It's going to be OK.

964
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:54,535
Hello?

965
00:53:54,666 --> 00:53:55,928
There's been an accident.

966
00:53:59,888 --> 00:54:02,543
PRIEST: The lord is myshepherd, I shall not want.

967
00:54:02,674 --> 00:54:05,416
He makes me lie down
in green pastures,

968
00:54:05,546 --> 00:54:10,290
he leads me beside stillwaters, he restores my soul,

969
00:54:10,421 --> 00:54:13,902
he leads me in paths ofrighteousness for his namesake.

970
00:54:14,033 --> 00:54:16,122
Even though I walk through thevalley of the shadow of death,

971
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:19,386
I will fear no evil,
for you are with me.

972
00:54:19,517 --> 00:54:23,782
Your rod and your
staff, they comfort me.

973
00:54:23,912 --> 00:54:26,350
I know that the family
would like to thank you

974
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:29,962
all for coming, today,
and for your love

975
00:54:30,092 --> 00:54:31,398
and for your support
in this rough time.

976
00:54:34,793 --> 00:54:37,926
It's always difficult to
lose somebody you know.

977
00:54:38,057 --> 00:54:39,667
Her life meant so
much to us all.

978
00:54:42,844 --> 00:54:44,411
Thank you so much for
coming, and for honoring

979
00:54:44,542 --> 00:54:45,282
Mel Olson's life.

980
00:54:49,242 --> 00:54:50,635
Oh hey, don't run, you guys.

981
00:54:55,901 --> 00:54:57,076
Did you see Del?

982
00:54:57,206 --> 00:54:59,687
I've never really
seen him like that.

983
00:54:59,818 --> 00:55:02,516
I still can't
believe she's gone.

984
00:55:02,647 --> 00:55:05,214
And poor Tom.

985
00:55:05,345 --> 00:55:07,216
How are you doing?

986
00:55:07,347 --> 00:55:10,350
I'll be all right.

987
00:55:10,481 --> 00:55:11,525
I'm a bit freaked out.

988
00:55:11,656 --> 00:55:13,440
Aren't you guys?

989
00:55:13,571 --> 00:55:15,703
I mean, nothing happens aroundhere forever, and then two

990
00:55:15,834 --> 00:55:17,836
people die in as many weeks.

991
00:55:17,966 --> 00:55:19,446
And they say it
happens in threes.

992
00:55:19,577 --> 00:55:21,709
That's very
comforting, Shawna.

993
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:22,928
You know what I mean.

994
00:55:23,058 --> 00:55:24,364
It's just a little odd.

995
00:55:24,495 --> 00:55:26,584
Yeah, it is, but it was
an accident, all right?

996
00:55:26,714 --> 00:55:27,628
I'm sorry.

997
00:55:27,759 --> 00:55:29,021
I didn't mean anything by it.

998
00:55:29,151 --> 00:55:30,631
Listen, I just want
to take the kids home

999
00:55:30,762 --> 00:55:32,807
and I don't really want totalk about this right now.

1000
00:55:32,938 --> 00:55:35,375
Can we go?

1001
00:55:35,506 --> 00:55:38,900
You know, actually,
can we talk a minute?

1002
00:55:39,031 --> 00:55:39,814
I'll take you home.

1003
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:43,818
Yeah, sure.

1004
00:55:43,949 --> 00:55:44,906
You guys take as
long as you'd like.

1005
00:55:45,037 --> 00:55:46,386
You sure?

1006
00:55:46,517 --> 00:55:47,866
I just want to get
out of these clothes

1007
00:55:47,996 --> 00:55:50,825
and take a shower.

1008
00:55:50,956 --> 00:55:52,174
The drain's clogged again.

1009
00:55:52,305 --> 00:55:53,524
Use the kids'.

1010
00:55:53,654 --> 00:55:54,525
OK, bye.

1011
00:55:54,655 --> 00:55:56,918
See you at home.

1012
00:55:57,049 --> 00:55:58,964
Bye, Shawna.

1013
00:55:59,094 --> 00:55:59,878
Bye.

1014
00:56:03,447 --> 00:56:07,233
So, what's up?

1015
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:08,408
How much do you
know about Abby?

1016
00:56:11,716 --> 00:56:14,414
I don't think I likewhere this is going, Shawna.

1017
00:56:14,545 --> 00:56:16,373
What do you really
know about her?

1018
00:56:16,503 --> 00:56:18,984
Abby's been nothing buta godsend for this family.

1019
00:56:19,114 --> 00:56:21,203
I know, I know.

1020
00:56:21,334 --> 00:56:23,684
How are Max and Casey
taking everything?

1021
00:56:23,815 --> 00:56:25,991
I think they're
doing all right.

1022
00:56:26,121 --> 00:56:29,124
Abby's been helping them deal.

1023
00:56:29,255 --> 00:56:32,345
Sounds like she's taking over.

1024
00:56:32,476 --> 00:56:33,259
Thank you, Shawna.

1025
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:34,826
I needed to hear that.

1026
00:56:34,956 --> 00:56:36,610
That's what I'm here for.

1027
00:56:36,741 --> 00:56:37,437
Sorry.

1028
00:56:40,701 --> 00:56:43,530
[water running]

1029
00:57:17,912 --> 00:57:18,783
Thanks.

1030
00:57:18,913 --> 00:57:20,262
Don't mention it.

1031
00:57:38,759 --> 00:57:43,329
Sorry, I didn't know
anyone was in here.

1032
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:44,330
It's OK.

1033
00:58:15,404 --> 00:58:16,362
The kids are finally asleep.

1034
00:58:20,018 --> 00:58:22,847
You all right?

1035
00:58:22,977 --> 00:58:26,067
MEGHAN: Carter, are
you attracted to Abby?

1036
00:58:29,375 --> 00:58:30,550
What kind of question is that?

1037
00:58:30,681 --> 00:58:31,420
Don't be defensive.

1038
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:34,162
I'm just curious.

1039
00:58:34,293 --> 00:58:35,686
I'm not being defensive.

1040
00:58:35,816 --> 00:58:36,991
You're not?

1041
00:58:37,122 --> 00:58:38,297
CARTER: Why are we
arguing about this?

1042
00:58:38,427 --> 00:58:40,299
Because you won't
answer the question.

1043
00:58:40,429 --> 00:58:41,300
This is ridiculous.

1044
00:58:41,430 --> 00:58:43,041
MEGHAN: Answer the question.

1045
00:58:43,171 --> 00:58:45,217
CARTER: I can't believe thatwe're having this conversation.

1046
00:58:45,347 --> 00:58:46,740
Trust me, you're the
only girl for me.

1047
00:58:46,871 --> 00:58:52,746
But she's-- she's
so young and pretty.

1048
00:58:52,877 --> 00:58:54,400
She is, but she's not you.

1049
00:58:59,405 --> 00:59:03,627
MEGHAN: Shawna asked me somestrange questions today.

1050
00:59:03,757 --> 00:59:04,671
About what?

1051
00:59:04,802 --> 00:59:06,368
Abby.

1052
00:59:06,499 --> 00:59:10,242
She asked me how well I knewAbby, and if I trusted her.

1053
00:59:10,372 --> 00:59:12,331
What did you say?

1054
00:59:12,461 --> 00:59:14,899
I told her Abby's been great.

1055
00:59:15,029 --> 00:59:18,163
It did get me thinking.

1056
00:59:18,293 --> 00:59:20,861
No, come on, I mean it.

1057
00:59:20,992 --> 00:59:24,561
Right before I found Mel
she left me this message

1058
00:59:24,691 --> 00:59:26,954
on my voicemail, and
she said that she

1059
00:59:27,085 --> 00:59:29,696
had to talk to me right awayabout something important.

1060
00:59:29,827 --> 00:59:30,958
Honey, I wouldn't
worry about it.

1061
00:59:31,089 --> 00:59:32,569
Shawna's just paranoid.

1062
00:59:32,699 --> 00:59:34,005
She's been suspicious ofpeople ever since her divorce.

1063
00:59:34,135 --> 00:59:37,051
Is it possible that maybe
you're just jealous?

1064
00:59:37,182 --> 00:59:38,531
Jealous?

1065
00:59:38,662 --> 00:59:40,446
The kids have really
taken a shine to Abby.

1066
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:43,275
MEGHAN: But do you actuallythink that I'm jealous of Abby?

1067
00:59:43,405 --> 00:59:46,408
Meghan, you just askedme if I'm attracted to her.

1068
00:59:46,539 --> 00:59:50,021
I know, I just--

1069
00:59:50,151 --> 00:59:51,675
I'm going crazy.

1070
00:59:51,805 --> 00:59:53,633
I've been thinking that witheverything that's happened

1071
00:59:53,764 --> 00:59:59,334
around here that maybe I needto spend some more time at home,

1072
00:59:59,465 --> 01:00:00,901
you know, for the kids' sake.

1073
01:00:01,032 --> 01:00:02,947
Stan Gable's
little case was nice.

1074
01:00:03,077 --> 01:00:06,080
We're set for a while.

1075
01:00:06,211 --> 01:00:10,389
Maybe-- maybe the
truth is we don't need

1076
01:00:10,519 --> 01:00:13,958
a full-time sitter anymore.

1077
01:00:14,088 --> 01:00:17,265
MEGHAN: All right,
well, then tomorrow I

1078
01:00:17,396 --> 01:00:21,400
will work from house,
and maybe I'll get

1079
01:00:21,530 --> 01:00:22,880
to know Abby a little better.

1080
01:00:28,450 --> 01:00:29,234
Tomorrow.

1081
01:00:37,242 --> 01:00:39,810
Bring then by any time.

1082
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:41,986
Thanks, Shawna.

1083
01:00:42,116 --> 01:00:42,900
Everything cool?

1084
01:00:43,030 --> 01:00:44,075
Yep.

1085
01:00:44,205 --> 01:00:45,816
I gave Shawna the
heads up, and I

1086
01:00:45,946 --> 01:00:48,253
think they'll be able tofunction without me for a day.

1087
01:00:48,383 --> 01:00:49,558
Where's Abby?

1088
01:00:49,689 --> 01:00:51,517
I saw her this morning.

1089
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:52,823
It's almost time for school.

1090
01:00:52,953 --> 01:00:54,172
Don't worry about it.

1091
01:00:54,302 --> 01:00:55,564
I told her I'd drop
the kids on the way.

1092
01:00:55,695 --> 01:00:56,740
Morning, mom.

1093
01:00:56,870 --> 01:00:57,915
Morning.

1094
01:00:58,045 --> 01:00:58,829
Come on, you guys.

1095
01:00:58,959 --> 01:01:00,526
We gotta go.

1096
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:02,093
- All right.
- Bye, mom

1097
01:01:02,223 --> 01:01:03,485
Bye, bye, I'll see
you guys tonight.

1098
01:01:03,616 --> 01:01:04,486
See you later, honey.
Bye.

1099
01:01:04,617 --> 01:01:06,140
Bye.

1100
01:01:06,271 --> 01:01:07,054

1102

Abby?

1103
01:01:26,073 --> 01:01:26,857
Abby?

1104
01:01:29,250 --> 01:01:30,034
Abby?

1105
01:01:43,569 --> 01:01:46,441
Abby?

1106
01:01:46,572 --> 01:01:47,355
Ugh, oh!

1107
01:02:00,629 --> 01:02:03,241
Meghan?

1108
01:02:03,371 --> 01:02:04,242
Are you all right?

1109
01:02:36,535 --> 01:02:41,018
Please, my boss just
had an accident.

1110
01:02:41,148 --> 01:02:43,150
She fell down the stairs.

1111
01:02:43,281 --> 01:02:45,762
She's not moving.

1112
01:02:45,892 --> 01:02:47,633
Yes.

1113
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:49,809
Yes.

1114
01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:50,723
Thank you.

1115
01:03:03,127 --> 01:03:04,737
Don't worry, Meghan.

1116
01:03:04,868 --> 01:03:07,827
I'll take good care of you.

1117
01:03:07,958 --> 01:03:09,220
Knock, knock.

1118
01:03:09,350 --> 01:03:13,964
Hey, Meghan, I found
the Fitzgerald file.

1119
01:03:14,094 --> 01:03:15,269
Shawna.

1120
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:16,618
Thank god.

1121
01:03:16,749 --> 01:03:17,489
Meghan fell.

1122
01:03:21,885 --> 01:03:23,625
Hey, Meg.

1123
01:03:23,756 --> 01:03:25,453
Can you hear me?

1124
01:03:25,584 --> 01:03:26,977
I don't know what happened.

1125
01:03:27,107 --> 01:03:28,413
I was in the bathroom,and then I came downstairs

1126
01:03:28,543 --> 01:03:30,371
and she was like this.

1127
01:03:30,502 --> 01:03:32,199
Meghan, sweetheart.

1128
01:03:32,330 --> 01:03:34,071
I already called 911,
they're on their way.

1129
01:03:34,201 --> 01:03:35,072
Good.

1130
01:03:35,202 --> 01:03:35,942
MEGHAN: Shawna--

1131
01:03:45,299 --> 01:03:46,518
Abby.

1132
01:03:46,648 --> 01:03:47,432
What happened?

1133
01:03:49,782 --> 01:03:51,392
I'm not sure.

1134
01:03:51,523 --> 01:03:53,830
She must have tripped
coming down the stairs.

1135
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:55,048
Is she all right?

1136
01:03:55,179 --> 01:03:57,398
I think so, but
she's badly bruised

1137
01:03:57,529 --> 01:03:59,226
and her ankles are broken.

1138
01:03:59,357 --> 01:04:00,401
Shawna's in with her now.

1139
01:04:00,532 --> 01:04:01,315
I'll go see her.

1140
01:04:01,446 --> 01:04:02,403
Of course.

1141
01:04:02,534 --> 01:04:03,317
I'll go pick up Casey and Max.

1142
01:04:12,544 --> 01:04:15,460
Good thing you
stayed home today, huh?

1143
01:04:15,590 --> 01:04:17,244
Don't make me laugh.

1144
01:04:17,375 --> 01:04:20,769
So it's a couple of brokenankles, some cuts and bruises.

1145
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:23,207
I'm sorry.

1146
01:04:23,337 --> 01:04:24,077
Honey.

1147
01:04:29,822 --> 01:04:30,997
I'll give you
guys a few minutes.

1148
01:04:31,128 --> 01:04:31,868
Yeah.

1149
01:04:35,697 --> 01:04:36,524
Oh, honey.

1150
01:04:39,527 --> 01:04:42,791
How are you doing?

1151
01:04:42,922 --> 01:04:45,664
I feel like such an idiot.

1152
01:04:45,794 --> 01:04:47,579
Don't say that.

1153
01:04:47,709 --> 01:04:49,189
It was an accident.

1154
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:51,844
I know.

1155
01:04:51,975 --> 01:04:54,151
I can't believe it.

1156
01:04:54,281 --> 01:04:57,023
I was looking for Abby.

1157
01:04:57,154 --> 01:05:03,682
I couldn't find
her, and then I--

1158
01:05:03,812 --> 01:05:06,119
I guess I tripped, and
the next thing I knew,

1159
01:05:06,250 --> 01:05:10,167
she was at my side
and calling 911.

1160
01:05:10,297 --> 01:05:12,996
And then Shawna came.

1161
01:05:13,126 --> 01:05:16,825
That fall really knocked
the wind out of me.

1162
01:05:16,956 --> 01:05:18,305
Abby may have saved my life.

1163
01:05:21,830 --> 01:05:24,224
I'll let you get some sleep.

1164
01:05:24,355 --> 01:05:25,704
Don't you worry about a thing.

1165
01:05:25,834 --> 01:05:28,881
Abby will help out at home.

1166
01:05:29,012 --> 01:05:32,276
Damn lucky we have her, huh?

1167
01:05:32,406 --> 01:05:33,146
I'll say.

1168
01:05:37,281 --> 01:05:39,761
You get some rest.

1169
01:05:39,892 --> 01:05:43,417

home in no time.

I need you to check

01:06:08,094 --> 01:06:09,226
Check on someone?

What are we, a

Find out what you
can on an Abigail Reed.

1180
01:06:19,714 --> 01:06:20,498
Got it.

1181
01:06:20,628 --> 01:06:22,282
What did she do?

1182
01:06:22,413 --> 01:06:24,415

1183
01:06:24,545 --> 01:06:25,807

1184
01:06:25,938 --> 01:06:26,678

Really, but only
if you're good.

to need all our help

she can come home?

No promises.

just believe me.

would love it if you

01:08:45,033 --> 01:08:46,252
I will.

1239
01:09:19,067 --> 01:09:21,853
OK, all right,
give her some air.

1240
01:09:21,983 --> 01:09:25,248

wash up, all right?

1245
01:09:47,661 --> 01:09:50,011
Probably made all the
difference in the world.

I did what I had to do.

1247
01:09:51,796 --> 01:09:54,668
Well, I can work from home,but I am going to go crazy

home in one piece.

And to Abby for being
more than a sitter.

Cheers.

1256
01:10:13,992 --> 01:10:14,862
All right.

1257
01:10:17,952 --> 01:10:19,040
Careful, careful.
- Ouch.

1258

Oh, sorry, sorry.

It's been a long timesince you carried me to bed.

Well, it would be a
lot more romantic if you

1261
01:10:24,394 --> 01:10:26,222
didn't have broken ankles.

1262
01:10:26,352 --> 01:10:29,660

not an ankle man.

1263
01:10:29,790 --> 01:10:30,574
OK.

1264
01:10:34,012 --> 01:10:35,318
Abby, I'll drop
the kids off today.

1265
01:10:35,448 --> 01:10:36,580
They way, you can
stay with Meghan.

1266
01:10:36,710 --> 01:10:38,103
That would be great.
Is she up yet?

1267
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:39,626
No, not yet, but youmight check on her later.

I got it.

1272
01:10:55,076 --> 01:10:56,295
Thanks.

1273
01:10:56,426 --> 01:10:57,470
Is there anything
I can do for you?

1274
01:11:00,865 --> 01:11:02,258
You know, a bath
would feel great.

1275
01:11:02,388 --> 01:11:03,650
Would you mind
running it for me?

1276
01:11:03,781 --> 01:11:04,477
I'd love to.

1277
01:11:18,012 --> 01:11:19,666
Do you want any music?

1278
01:11:19,797 --> 01:11:21,494
Oh, no.

1279
01:11:21,625 --> 01:11:24,671
I'm kind of enjoying the quietwhile the kids are in school,

1280
01:11:24,802 --> 01:11:25,672
but thank you.

1281
01:11:25,803 --> 01:11:26,543
My pleasure.

1282
01:11:29,676 --> 01:11:33,027
[ominous music]

1283
01:12:54,152 --> 01:12:56,328
You know, a bath
would feel great.

1284
01:12:59,679 --> 01:13:00,637
Pearson and Weiss.

1285
01:13:00,767 --> 01:13:02,421
Please have good news.

1286
01:13:02,552 --> 01:13:04,989
Well, that depends
on how you look at it.

1287
01:13:05,119 --> 01:13:07,034
I found an Abigail Reed.

1288
01:13:07,165 --> 01:13:10,255
She's from a small suburb inL.A. County called Dyer's Bay,

1289
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:13,476
and she even spent time
in an orphanage there.

1290
01:13:13,606 --> 01:13:14,825
But?

1291
01:13:14,955 --> 01:13:17,784
But she's been dead
for almost 10 years.

1292
01:13:17,915 --> 01:13:19,569
What?

1293
01:13:19,699 --> 01:13:22,006
Abigail Reed was an orphanwho was found dead in the shower

1294
01:13:22,136 --> 01:13:23,921
when she was 15 years old.

1295
01:13:24,051 --> 01:13:25,488
How is that possible?

1296
01:13:25,618 --> 01:13:27,664
Well, there may
be something here.

1297
01:13:27,794 --> 01:13:30,971
The orphanage said thatAbigail's best friend there

1298
01:13:31,102 --> 01:13:33,713
disappeared shortly
after her death.

1299
01:13:33,844 --> 01:13:36,368
They assumed she freaked
out and ran away.

1300
01:13:36,499 --> 01:13:41,199
Her name was Linda Reynolds, andshe was also from Dyer's Bay.

1301
01:13:41,329 --> 01:13:43,462
Why does any of this matter?

1302
01:13:43,593 --> 01:13:46,944
Because, according to this,Linda wasn't really an orphan.

1303
01:13:47,074 --> 01:13:48,989
She was a ward of the state.

1304
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:51,035
Her mother went nuts
when she was like seven

1305
01:13:51,165 --> 01:13:52,515
and they locked her up.

1306
01:13:52,645 --> 01:13:54,081
What about the father?

1307
01:13:54,212 --> 01:13:56,736
Disappeared, never seen again.

1308
01:13:56,867 --> 01:13:58,999
They found little Lindalocked up in her bedroom.

1309
01:13:59,130 --> 01:14:00,958
She's been there a while, too.

1310
01:14:01,088 --> 01:14:02,612
Pretty creepy, huh?

1311
01:14:02,742 --> 01:14:05,745
And let me guess, you foundno trace of Linda Reynolds

1312
01:14:05,876 --> 01:14:07,878
after the death of
Abby Reed, right?

1313
01:14:08,008 --> 01:14:09,270
Yeah.

1314
01:14:09,401 --> 01:14:10,446
Is Linda Reynolds'
mother still alive?

1315
01:14:10,576 --> 01:14:11,664
Yeah.

1316
01:14:11,795 --> 01:14:13,840
She lives in a state
mental hospital

1317
01:14:13,971 --> 01:14:14,798
up north a little ways.

1318
01:14:14,928 --> 01:14:16,321
Been there almost 20 years.

1319
01:14:16,452 --> 01:14:19,280
You're not thinking aboutgoing up there, are you?

1320
01:14:19,411 --> 01:14:20,151
Just give me the address.

1321
01:14:38,125 --> 01:14:38,909
Abby?

1322
01:14:44,131 --> 01:14:47,526
Abby, can you get
my prescription?

1323
01:14:47,657 --> 01:14:48,440
Abby?

1324
01:14:58,276 --> 01:14:59,059
Abby?

1325

[ominous music]

1326
01:15:49,806 --> 01:15:52,156

Please leave us a message.

1330
01:16:12,742 --> 01:16:14,004
Hi guys, it's me.

1331
01:16:14,134 --> 01:16:15,571
It's kind of slow at
the office today, so I'm

1332
01:16:15,701 --> 01:16:17,224
going to come home early.

1333
01:16:17,355 --> 01:16:19,705
Abby, if you get this, wouldyou pick up Max and Casey?

1334
01:16:19,836 --> 01:16:20,924
OK, see you soon.

1335
01:16:21,054 --> 01:16:21,838
Bye.

1337
01:16:25,929 --> 01:16:26,669
Mrs. Reynolds?

1338
01:16:29,802 --> 01:16:30,586
Mrs. Reynolds.

1339
01:16:34,198 --> 01:16:34,894
You have a visitor.

1340
01:16:37,854 --> 01:16:39,725
Would you mind giving
me a minute, please?

1341
01:16:56,176 --> 01:16:59,310
Do you remember your daughterLinda, Mrs. Reynolds?

1342
01:17:03,096 --> 01:17:06,360
[humming]

1343
01:17:15,761 --> 01:17:18,372
Why are you doing this?

1344
01:17:18,503 --> 01:17:21,767
Love makes you dostrange things sometimes.

1345
01:17:21,898 --> 01:17:23,290
What?

1346
01:17:23,421 --> 01:17:26,119
Why don't we just wait
for Carter to get home.

1347
01:17:26,250 --> 01:17:27,381
I don't want to have
to repeat myself.

1348
01:17:30,602 --> 01:17:33,474
Carter won't be
home for hours.

1349
01:17:33,605 --> 01:17:34,780
He called while
you were napping.

1350
01:17:34,911 --> 01:17:35,912
He'll be home any minute.

1351
01:17:39,785 --> 01:17:43,006
I can't wait.

1352
01:17:43,136 --> 01:17:44,703
Meghan, where are you going?

1353
01:17:48,272 --> 01:17:49,621
Now what are you gonna do?

1354
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:53,843
Oh, come on.

1355
01:17:53,973 --> 01:17:55,018
This is embarrassing.

1356
01:17:55,148 --> 01:17:56,236
You want to go down?

1357
01:17:56,367 --> 01:17:57,629
Then go.

1359
01:18:03,243 --> 01:18:04,592
Is that better?

1360

Daddy's home.

1361
01:18:36,450 --> 01:18:38,148
Come on Carter, pick up.

get my message?

Oh, I gotta go.

1389
01:21:04,947 --> 01:21:07,558
School's out soon.

1390
01:21:07,688 --> 01:21:08,515
Don't go anywhere, OK?

1391
01:21:15,174 --> 01:21:16,654
Hey, you guys want to playa game when we get home?

1392
01:21:16,784 --> 01:21:17,568
BOTH: Yeah.

1393
01:21:17,698 --> 01:21:18,786
Great, let's go.

1394
01:21:53,778 --> 01:21:56,215
Carter, you're awake.

1395
01:21:56,346 --> 01:21:58,522
Good.

1396
01:21:58,652 --> 01:21:59,915
Did you have a nice nap?

1397
01:22:05,964 --> 01:22:06,834
Ugh.

1398
01:22:06,965 --> 01:22:08,271
Abby, what's going on?

1399
01:22:08,401 --> 01:22:09,315
Where's Meghan?

1400
01:22:09,446 --> 01:22:11,752
Don't worry, she's fine.

1401
01:22:11,883 --> 01:22:14,016
Well, sort of.

1402
01:22:14,146 --> 01:22:16,018
Why are you doing this?

1403
01:22:16,148 --> 01:22:18,107
Can you honestly say youdon't remember me at all?

1404
01:22:18,237 --> 01:22:20,370
No.

1405
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:22,676
Don't hurt the kids.

1406
01:22:22,807 --> 01:22:25,418
I wouldn't do that, Carter.

1407
01:22:25,549 --> 01:22:28,856
I never even wanted to hurt you.

1408
01:22:28,987 --> 01:22:31,685
Oh, you were so handsome.

1409
01:22:31,816 --> 01:22:40,259
I mean, you're handsome now, butwhen we first met, I felt it.

1410
01:22:40,390 --> 01:22:42,914
And I know you felt it, too.

1411
01:22:43,045 --> 01:22:45,047
Abby, I have no ideawhat you're talking about.

1412
01:22:45,177 --> 01:22:47,440
Please, I don't know whatyou're thinking, but please.

1413
01:22:47,571 --> 01:22:49,747
You're hurting my
feelings, Carter.

1414
01:22:49,877 --> 01:22:53,751
I would have thought by
now you'd remember me

1415
01:22:53,881 --> 01:22:57,494
and the time we spent
together in Dyer's Bay.

1416
01:22:57,624 --> 01:22:59,409
Dyer's Bay?

1417
01:22:59,539 --> 01:23:02,325
My mother was a psycho.

1418
01:23:02,455 --> 01:23:07,591
My father and I tried toleave, but she wouldn't let us.

1419
01:23:07,721 --> 01:23:13,379
You know what it's like to betied up and left in a bedroom,

1420
01:23:13,510 --> 01:23:15,903
like an animal.

1421
01:23:16,034 --> 01:23:21,692
My father left us, at least,that's what she told me.

1422
01:23:21,822 --> 01:23:26,001
Maybe I was just an impressionof a little seven-year-old.

1423
01:23:26,131 --> 01:23:31,310
Maybe I needed a fatherfigure, but watching you then,

1424
01:23:31,441 --> 01:23:33,225
you were so convincing.

1425
01:23:37,229 --> 01:23:40,493
I think I fell in love
with you that very day.

1426
01:23:40,624 --> 01:23:42,756
You're Elizabeth
Reynolds' daughter.

1427
01:23:42,887 --> 01:23:44,715
Ding, ding!

1428
01:23:44,845 --> 01:23:46,369
We have a winner!

1429
01:23:46,499 --> 01:23:47,805
What do you want from me?

1430
01:23:47,935 --> 01:23:49,372
What do I want?

1431
01:23:49,502 --> 01:23:51,765
I want you.

1432
01:23:51,896 --> 01:23:55,247
I want what's mine, and
I'm going to have it.

1433
01:23:55,378 --> 01:23:56,553
You're crazy.

1434
01:23:56,683 --> 01:23:58,598
But I love you.

1435
01:23:58,729 --> 01:24:02,037
I've always loved you.

1436
01:24:02,167 --> 01:24:06,215
Abby, what have
you done with Meghan?

1437
01:24:06,345 --> 01:24:08,913
Oh.

1438
01:24:09,044 --> 01:24:09,957
Let me get her for you.

1439
01:24:13,570 --> 01:24:15,963
[music playing]

1440
01:24:16,094 --> 01:24:17,791
You know, Meghan,
none of this would've

1441
01:24:17,922 --> 01:24:21,317
been necessary if you'dhave been a better mother.

1442
01:24:21,447 --> 01:24:24,929
Leaving little Max and Casey allalone with a complete stranger?

1443
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:26,931
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

1444
01:24:27,062 --> 01:24:29,412
[screams]

1445
01:24:29,542 --> 01:24:32,197
Think that's clever, bitch?

1446
01:24:32,328 --> 01:24:34,678
[screams]

1447
01:24:42,294 --> 01:24:43,643
You all right?

1448
01:24:43,774 --> 01:24:44,644
I'm all right.

1449
01:24:50,781 --> 01:24:52,609
Watch out, watch out!

1450
01:25:39,046 --> 01:25:40,918
It's my family.

1451
01:25:41,048 --> 01:25:41,919
It's mine.

1452
01:26:01,504 --> 01:26:05,421
Honey, you all right?

1453
01:26:05,551 --> 01:26:13,516
I'm all right, but
I fired the sitter.

1454
01:26:13,646 --> 01:26:17,215
[laughing]
