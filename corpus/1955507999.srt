I don't know if you're insane  just a 

51
00:04:42,95 --> 00:04:48,83
cold-blooded killer  but I do know this 

52
00:04:46,31 --> 00:04:52,82
 you're not gonna   get away with it this 

53
00:04:48,83 --> 00:04:55,61
time

54
00:04:52,82 --> 00:04:56,99
ladies and gentlemen of the jury  what 

55
00:04:55,61 --> 00:04:59,09
 miss Sanders here is trying to do is 

56
00:04:56,99 --> 00:05:02,0
convince you that my client is guilty of

57
00:04:59,09 --> 00:05:06,14
many things  guilty of being angry   guilty 

58
00:05:06,14 --> 00:05:09,919
you know what

59
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:13,07
 miss Sanders is probably right he   is 

60
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:17,93
 guilty guilty of wanting things that are 

61
00:05:13,07 --> 00:05:19,82
so far outside of his  grasp   guilty of 

62
00:05:17,93 --> 00:05:22,58
being outraged  to society which rewards 

63
00:05:19,82 --> 00:05:27,65
only the wealthy and the manipulative

64
00:05:22,58 --> 00:05:30,02
guilty of yes  turn into a bottle   when he 

65
00:05:27,65 --> 00:05:37,34
felt the mankind rendered him impotent

66
00:05:30,02 --> 00:05:40,52
 and powerless except miss Sanders has 

67
00:05:37,34 --> 00:05:44,87
failed to do is prove the  Bernard 

68
00:05:40,52 --> 00:05:47,21
Winslow is guilty of murder  failed to 

69
00:05:44,87 --> 00:05:49,79
prove beyond a reasonable doubt that

70
00:05:47,21 --> 00:05:53,93
this man committed such a monstrous  act 

71
00:05:49,79 --> 00:05:55,85
 now we all know Bernard   Winslow   there's 

72
00:05:53,93 --> 00:05:57,53
a little bit of  Bernard and   all of us 

73
00:05:55,85 --> 00:06:01,13
I  mean who among us is not   know what it 

74
00:05:57,53 --> 00:06:06,2
feels  like to be angry to be frustrated 

75
00:06:01,13 --> 00:06:07,55
 to feel powerless   murdered these 

76
00:06:06,2 --> 00:06:11,419
feelings  do not a cold-blooded killer 

77
00:06:07,55 --> 00:06:12,32
make these feelings don't even make us

78
00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:16,58
unique

79
00:06:12,32 --> 00:06:18,29
now  i would venture to say that district 

80
00:06:16,58 --> 00:06:22,34
 attorney Sanders is the first person to 

81
00:06:18,29 --> 00:06:27,52
admit to feelings of  that   Envy utility 

82
00:06:22,34 --> 00:06:32,65
 and she is not on trial for murder 

83
00:06:27,52 --> 00:06:35,59
 so I beseech you go into that room and 

84
00:06:32,65 --> 00:06:41,05

85
00:06:35,59 --> 00:06:52,62

gone bad but the witness can be

206
00:14:05,38 --> 00:14:09,46
 challenged in the motive is 

207
00:14:06,37 --> 00:14:10,42
circumstantial at best  the DA   searching 

208
00:14:09,46 --> 00:14:11,05
 for something   and I want you to find out 

209
00:14:10,42 --> 00:14:13,24

259
00:17:25,789 --> 00:17:29,99
woman's voice  listen to me it sounds 

260
00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:32,48
like  someone trying to stir up some 

261
00:17:29,99 --> 00:17:35,179
media hype it happens on  high-profile 

262
00:17:32,48 --> 00:17:36,98
cases like this  you really think   so 

263
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:39,08

 I didn't sleep very well guess   I'm not 

270
00:18:09,08 --> 00:18:13,039
as resilient as  i thought i was would 

271
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:15,32
 you like to go   out for   some coffee 

272
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:17,21

274
00:18:17,21 --> 00:18:20,36
 besides I want to   apologize for calling 

275
00:18:18,98 --> 00:18:27,549
you in the middle of the night like some

276
00:18:20,36 --> 00:18:30,61

 this a/c left over an hour ago 

279
00:18:32,769 --> 00:18:37,059
it's not like him to be this late  now 

280
00:18:35,44 --> 00:18:40,21
this could definitely give a whole new

281
00:18:37,059 --> 00:18:43,269
meaning to the term  hung jury 

282
00:18:40,21 --> 00:18:45,19
 morning ladies where have you been 

283
00:18:43,269 --> 00:18:46,57
do I detect a note of indignation  in 

284
00:18:45,19 --> 00:18:47,679
 that question   you were supposed to be 

285
00:18:46,57 --> 00:18:48,61
here an hour and a half ago to go  over 

286
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:59,43
the archer case

287
00:18:48,61 --> 00:19:03,72
 Claire   and   I met over breakfast sort of 

288
00:18:59,43 --> 00:19:05,25
 why didn't you tell me   i wasn't aware   I 

289
00:19:03,72 --> 00:19:07,14
had  to clear my schedule with you Simon 

290
00:19:05,25 --> 00:19:08,13
 you know what   I mean   how am   I supposed 

291
00:19:07,14 --> 00:19:10,02
to stay ahead of this case if  I'm 

292
00:19:08,13 --> 00:19:11,34
excluded from every meeting  clear is a 

293
00:19:10,02 --> 00:19:13,17
bit uncomfortable talking  in front of 

294
00:19:11,34 --> 00:19:15,63
anyone else

295
00:19:13,17 --> 00:19:17,37
 Claire   is about to have the most 

296
00:19:15,63 --> 00:19:20,16
intimate details of her life  spilled to 

297
00:19:17,37 --> 00:19:21,78
a  court room   full of people 

298
00:19:20,16 --> 00:19:24,15
she's a trained psychologist Simon she's

299
00:19:21,78 --> 00:19:26,88
manipulating you  she's not manipulating 

300
00:19:24,15 --> 00:19:29,07
anyone  look sometimes paranoia   was 

301
00:19:26,88 --> 00:19:30,69
 justified   the woman is being persecuted 

302
00:19:29,07 --> 00:19:31,98
by the district  attorney's office over 

303
00:19:30,69 --> 00:19:33,9
something that  should've been written 

304
00:19:31,98 --> 00:19:37,14
off the books 20 minutes after  happened 

305
00:19:33,9 --> 00:19:40,26
do you think that attitude is just a

306
00:19:37,14 --> 00:19:42,39
little naive  i am part of your defense 

307
00:19:40,26 --> 00:19:52,02
team I'm not the enemy  and stop acting 

308
00:19:42,39 --> 00:19:55,23
like it are you  attracted to her she's a 

309
00:19:52,02 --> 00:19:56,67
 very attractive woman   now do   you have 

310
00:19:55,23 --> 00:20:02,3
 the broker deposition 

311
00:19:56,67 --> 00:20:36,94

312
00:20:02,3 --> 00:20:41,77
 there was with you 

313
00:20:36,94 --> 00:20:45,13

00:20:55,12 --> 00:21:00,22
you got again

318
00:20:56,14 --> 00:21:01,93
 ok let's see the eyewitness is a 

319
00:21:00,22 --> 00:21:03,07
 Guatemalan housekeeper she was working 

320
00:21:01,93 --> 00:21:04,81
for the  next door neighbors at the time 

321
00:21:03,07 --> 00:21:06,16
filling in for their regular  made it 

322
00:21:04,81 --> 00:21:08,08
 seems she didn't come forward because of 

323
00:21:06,16 --> 00:21:10,33
a problem with the  is although the   DA 

324
00:21:08,08 --> 00:21:12,43
has offered her immunity  she does not 

325
00:21:10,33 --> 00:21:13,39
speak  english very well and she could 

326
00:21:12,43 --> 00:21:15,7
not have been closer than a few hundred

327
00:21:13,39 --> 00:21:17,65
yards  motive 

328
00:21:15,7 --> 00:21:19,93
 Alan clay was making a movie based on 

329

 Claire   archers life prosecution has 

330
00:21:19,93 --> 00:21:23,59
several strong statements from  Studio 

331
00:21:21,46 --> 00:21:25,96
employees that dr. Archer was bitterly

332
00:21:23,59 --> 00:21:28,33
opposed to the content of the script  and 

333
00:21:25,96 --> 00:21:29,95
the so-called  free liberties that having 

334
00:21:28,33 --> 00:21:31,93
clay and  Deputy   summers   are taking the 

335
00:21:29,95 --> 00:21:35,26
facts  aren't   enough for libel suit   that 

336
00:21:31,93 --> 00:21:40,48
for murder unless somebody dug too deep

337
00:21:35,26 --> 00:21:42,37
and exhumed  something about dr. Archer 

338
00:21:40,48 --> 00:21:43,36
she doesn't want anyone to know  he's 

339
00:21:42,37 --> 00:21:48,25

00:28:41,75 --> 00:28:45,559
the dog was barking and  and then   I 

389
00:28:43,58 --> 00:28:47,539

00:28:59,99 --> 00:29:03,32
office

397
00:29:00,769 --> 00:29:05,09

398
00:29:03,32 --> 00:29:06,11
I mean she works for you not the other

399
00:29:05,09 --> 00:29:08,659

we've got a very heavy  caseload right 

401
00:29:08,659 --> 00:29:14,509

402
00:29:12,86 --> 00:29:18,98
 like   if you   spent an evening alone with 

403
00:29:14,509 --> 00:29:21,889

410
00:29:29,99 --> 00:29:36,44

00:29:47,24 --> 00:29:55,309
 masters has offered me a new book   dealer 

416
00:29:51,08 --> 00:29:56,929
 sensor doesn't seem   to be a vacation in 

417
00:29:55,309 --> 00:30:08,98
the near future

418
00:29:56,929 --> 00:30:10,57
 I'm gonna take it 

419
00:30:08,98 --> 00:30:14,35
 good morning   I know I'm early   i'll just 

420
00:30:10,57 --> 00:30:31,929
wait if you don't mind that  wait up 

421
00:30:14,35 --> 00:30:36,909

422
00:30:31,929 --> 00:30:38,289
 seven yet   now he   called   me said he was 

423
00:30:36,909 --> 00:30:39,399
 going by the court   has to drop something 

424
00:30:38,289 --> 00:30:42,279
off to judge

425
00:30:39,399 --> 00:30:44,649
 Hibbert   but at his favorite client is 

426
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:55,47
here  your letter   in   this office 

427
00:30:44,649 --> 00:30:58,169
 hey I tried to   stop her I'll handle this 

428
00:30:55,47 --> 00:31:01,11
 excuse me   male is usually considered a 

429
00:30:58,169 --> 00:31:02,789
private matter  just   my nature to be 

430
00:31:01,11 --> 00:31:06,51
curious

431
00:31:02,789 --> 00:31:08,37
 it's my nature to be suspicious you 

432
00:31:06,51 --> 00:31:11,309
think I killed him don't you

433
00:31:08,37 --> 00:31:14,039
 it doesn't really   matter what I think   I 

434
00:31:11,309 --> 00:31:15,48
think  you and your high moral horse 

435
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:16,59
 would sell a client down the river if 

436
00:31:15,48 --> 00:31:20,429
you thought it was in the name of

437
00:31:16,59 --> 00:31:21,419
justice  the law and justice are not the 

438
00:31:20,429 --> 00:31:25,409
same thing

439
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:27,39
 justice is for   God then my guilt or 

440
00:31:25,409 --> 00:31:27,96
innocence  shouldn't be of any concern to 

441
00:31:27,39 --> 00:31:31,049
you

442
00:31:27,96 --> 00:31:34,02
someone once said a  jury is made up of 

443
00:31:31,049 --> 00:31:37,47
12 people brought together decide who

444
00:31:34,02 --> 00:31:39,72
has the best lawyer  I hired the best 

445
00:31:37,47 --> 00:31:42,36
simon doesn't really like anyone in  this 

446
00:31:39,72 --> 00:31:44,73
office when he's not here so perhaps you

447
00:31:42,36 --> 00:31:48,39
 could wait in the lobby you really take 

448
00:31:44,73 --> 00:31:51,63
good care of  him don't you 

449
00:31:48,39 --> 00:31:54,0
you know he's very fortunate to have

450
00:31:51,63 --> 00:31:57,36
someone fawning over him the way you do

451
00:31:57,36 --> 00:32:04,26
together  it's   sort of a maternal love 

452
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:05,789
slave  despiteful thing happening   only he 

453
00:32:04,26 --> 00:32:07,53
doesn't know  what   men seldom do 

454
00:32:05,789 --> 00:32:11,01
excuse me

455
00:32:07,53 --> 00:32:12,12

456
00:32:11,01 --> 00:32:14,7

457
00:32:12,12 --> 00:32:15,9
called  a parent sexual obsession 

458
00:32:14,7 --> 00:32:18,48

459
00:32:15,9 --> 00:32:21,12
anything about me  don't   buy   all those 

460
00:32:18,48 --> 00:32:23,01
 late nights at home alone   i bet you know 

461
00:32:21,12 --> 00:32:24,99
what kind of food he likes  his next 

462
00:32:23,01 --> 00:32:28,08
 sighs what kind of magazines you read 

463
00:32:24,99 --> 00:32:32,46

 time go to hell 

468
00:32:38,28 --> 00:32:45,6
 it would ruin everything if he knew 

469
00:32:41,04 --> 00:32:49,26
 don't worry your secret's safe 

470
00:32:45,6 --> 00:32:49,86

485
00:33:26,85 --> 00:33:30,18
 archer with a plea of guilty and i'll 

486
00:33:28,86 --> 00:33:31,2

00:33:30,18 --> 00:33:33,78
manslaughter  two 

488
00:33:31,2 --> 00:33:36,0
if you  had anything   you wouldn't be 

489
00:33:33,78 --> 00:33:39,27
offering  this isn't a game   Mitchell 

490
00:33:39,27 --> 00:33:48,09
than you think  my client   is innocent 

491
00:33:41,16 --> 00:33:50,31

492
00:33:48,09 --> 00:33:59,76
that  I doubt see you in court   counselor 

493
00:33:50,31 --> 00:34:01,29

perhaps  it's not my mistake you're 

503
00:34:18,75 --> 00:34:23,82
concerned about playing what the hell is

504
00:34:22,08 --> 00:34:25,29
wrong with you for the past  two weeks 

505
00:34:23,82 --> 00:34:25,77

509
00:34:29,07 --> 00:34:31,47

514
00:34:37,56 --> 00:34:40,679

 i am perfectly capable of handling my 

521
00:34:51,96 --> 00:34:58,31
own affairs  poor choice of words 

522
00:34:55,46 --> 00:35:30,97
 was   that supposed to mean   whatever you 

523
00:34:58,31 --> 00:35:50,64
 think it means 

524
00:35:30,97 --> 00:36:08,2
 we're here where 

525
00:35:50,64 --> 00:36:28,45

thanks

531
00:36:45,349 --> 00:36:54,799
 damn   late in   leaving   the police file a 

532
00:36:51,859 --> 00:36:56,93
lot of work to have every confidence in

533
00:36:56,93 --> 00:37:06,92
that's enough  clear   last night someone 

534
00:37:03,799 --> 00:37:12,2
dropped off  a tape   in my office 

535
00:37:06,92 --> 00:37:15,18
 he was a video of you and   Alan clay   did 

536
00:37:12,2 --> 00:37:20,099
you watch it

537
00:37:15,18 --> 00:37:21,42
 it's quite explicit   you have   an idea who 

538
00:37:20,099 --> 00:37:30,119
 might have dropped off that   tape or why 

539
00:37:21,42 --> 00:37:34,71
 i did   why you said you   wanted to know 

540
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:37,89
everything  I could have helped   if the 

541
00:37:34,71 --> 00:37:41,819
jury  that   I   think it's an illicit affair 

542
00:37:37,89 --> 00:37:45,72
 cost you points at the DA gets ahold of 

543
00:37:41,819 --> 00:37:46,859
 it'll be construed as motive   love tryst 

544
00:37:45,72 --> 00:37:50,7
gone awry

545
00:37:46,859 --> 00:37:51,39
it was more than that  Alan and I were in 

546
00:37:50,7 --> 00:37:55,17
love

547
00:37:51,39 --> 00:37:56,94
 the prosecution is trying to establish a 

548
00:37:55,17 --> 00:37:58,74
third person on the tennis court that

549
00:37:56,94 --> 00:38:01,109
 evening if they can prove   that it was 

550
00:37:58,74 --> 00:38:02,55

00:38:01,109 --> 00:38:03,54
 we can determine that there's someone 

552
00:38:02,55 --> 00:38:08,819
 else with motive 

553
00:38:03,54 --> 00:38:12,3

00:43:50,75 --> 00:43:55,94
good  until you're too smart for them 

586
00:43:54,74 --> 00:43:57,35

587
00:43:55,94 --> 00:44:19,099
client

599
00:45:43,93 --> 00:45:51,76
office  she left right after you did 

600
00:45:47,83 --> 00:45:53,26
no she didn't say  no as a matter of fact 

601
00:45:51,76 --> 00:45:55,21
she didn't even say that she was leaving

602
00:45:53,26 --> 00:45:58,57
she just ran out and a half

603
00:45:55,21 --> 00:46:00,55
why what's wrong  night it's it's nothing 

604
00:45:58,57 --> 00:46:02,05
look don't say anything about this to

605
00:46:00,55 --> 00:46:06,4
anybody else  alright and   I'll be   back in 

606
00:46:02,05 --> 00:46:07,119

607
00:46:06,4 --> 00:46:10,24

608
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:12,46

609
00:46:10,24 --> 00:46:15,16
angry with you said she was acting crazy

610
00:46:12,46 --> 00:46:16,66
 so what   I meant   Simon who else could 

611
00:46:15,16 --> 00:46:20,32
have done this besides  lane 

612
00:46:16,66 --> 00:46:21,7
 I don't know Lane has access to the 

613
00:46:20,32 --> 00:46:23,14
alarm code

614
00:46:23,14 --> 00:46:27,58
entry why  don't you at least say that it 

615
00:46:24,7 --> 00:46:29,71
could have been her  I couldn't   blame has 

616
00:46:27,58 --> 00:46:30,67
 been my sister for three years   I can't 

617
00:46:29,71 --> 00:46:31,57
accuse or something like that it's

618
00:46:30,67 --> 00:46:34,69
unthinkable

619
00:46:31,57 --> 00:46:36,28
she's jealous Simon please

620
00:46:34,69 --> 00:46:38,08
she's obsessed with you she feels

621
00:46:36,28 --> 00:46:41,17
rejected and she's acting irrationally

622
00:46:38,08 --> 00:46:42,52
upset  it's not so unthinkable if you 

623
00:46:41,17 --> 00:46:45,31
don't see that then you're totally

624
00:46:42,52 --> 00:46:48,97
oblivious  which isn't so unthinkable 

625
00:46:45,31 --> 00:46:50,289
either sometimes maybe you should do

626
00:46:48,97 --> 00:46:52,059

627
00:46:50,289 --> 00:47:36,32

amplifier  I've got   is definitely a 

677
00:51:33,789 --> 00:51:37,359
woman's voice on the tape  but she's 

678
00:51:35,589 --> 00:51:38,95

686
00:51:51,13 --> 00:51:55,479

00:56:29,2 --> 00:56:37,099
available to us  so noted 

735
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:41,269
 I don't like surprises 

736
00:56:37,099 --> 00:56:43,309
what's on the tape  I have no idea   on the 

737
00:56:41,269 --> 00:56:46,759
night that  Alan clay and   Freddie summers 

738
00:56:46,759 --> 00:56:50,66
cordless phone on the tennis court  Your 

739
00:56:49,309 --> 00:56:52,609
Honor I would like to play the contents

740
00:56:50,66 --> 00:56:54,859
of that  take for the court objection 

741
00:56:52,609 --> 00:56:56,089
motion to suppress your  honor the tape 

742
00:56:54,859 --> 00:56:57,95
just simply proves that there was a

743
00:56:56,089 --> 00:57:01,279
third party on the tennis court on the

744
00:56:57,95 --> 00:57:02,869
evening of the  11th   the essence of time 

745
00:57:01,279 --> 00:57:05,509
 i'll allow the tape but if I find it 

746
00:57:02,869 --> 00:57:21,99
misleading  strike it from evidence 

747
00:57:05,509 --> 00:57:29,15
thank  you 

748
00:57:21,99 --> 00:57:37,76
 killer 

749
00:57:29,15 --> 00:57:39,319
 mr.   miner can you   identify the male 

750
00:57:37,76 --> 00:57:41,99
voice on that tape to be that of  Ellen 

751
00:57:39,319 --> 00:57:44,75
clay  yes the voice on the tape   is 

752
00:57:41,99 --> 00:57:48,289
definitely that  a valid clays and   the 

753
00:57:44,75 --> 00:57:51,14
other voice  the woman's voice could that 

754
00:57:48,289 --> 00:57:53,839
 be the voice of   clear Archer   objection 

755
00:57:51,14 --> 00:57:55,309
it could be anyone's voice  Thank You 

756
00:57:53,839 --> 00:57:57,17
 counsel objection sustained 

757
00:57:55,309 --> 00:58:00,559
 miss Sanders you'll direct your   land of 

758
00:57:57,17 --> 00:58:06,559
 question to the facts not speculation 

759
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:09,049
yes your honor mr.  miner despite the 

760
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:11,93
quality of the tape  you can however 

761
00:58:09,049 --> 00:58:14,45
conclude that there was a woman on a

762
00:58:11,93 --> 00:58:16,01
tennis court with  Alan clay   at the time 

763
00:58:14,45 --> 00:58:17,63
of the call  can you not   there is 

764
00:58:16,01 --> 00:58:20,24
 definitely a woman in proximity at the 

765
00:58:17,63 --> 00:58:21,41
time the call was made yes thank you  I 

766
00:58:20,24 --> 00:58:23,059
have no further questions for this

767
00:58:21,41 --> 00:58:26,359
witness at this time  i would however 

768
00:58:23,059 --> 00:58:28,22
like to recall him at a later time  does 

769
00:58:26,359 --> 00:58:31,97
the  defense wish to cross-examine   yes 

770
00:58:28,22 --> 00:58:33,89
 you are   mr.   miner am I to understand 

771
00:58:31,97 --> 00:58:35,69
that you can positively identify  Alan 

772
00:58:33,89 --> 00:58:37,76
 plays voice on the tape   but not that of 

773
00:58:35,69 --> 00:58:40,43
a  third party that's correct 

774
00:58:37,76 --> 00:58:42,14
and why is that sir the third party was

775
00:58:40,43 --> 00:58:44,359
too far away from the phone  receiver to 

776
00:58:42,14 --> 00:58:47,059
get a clear  voice print however we can 

777
00:58:44,359 --> 00:58:49,549
 determine it was definitely a woman so 

778
00:58:47,059 --> 00:58:52,52
with  all the high-tech audio enhancement 

779
00:58:49,549 --> 00:58:55,16
at your disposal  is there any way 

780
00:58:52,52 --> 00:58:56,18
possible to distinguish the third voice

781
00:58:55,16 --> 00:58:57,74
on the tape

782
00:58:56,18 --> 00:59:02,39
not this time there's too much

783
00:58:57,74 --> 00:59:06,619
 distortion thank you for   the questions 

784
00:59:02,39 --> 00:59:19,589
the witness  is excused you may step down 

785
00:59:06,619 --> 00:59:25,799
 the people call Bob simply to the stand 

786
00:59:19,589 --> 00:59:27,359
 you swear to tell the truth the whole 

787
00:59:25,799 --> 00:59:34,41
truth and nothing but the truth so help

788
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:37,109
you  God I do mr. Sibley according to a 

789
00:59:34,41 --> 00:59:39,21
sworn statement made by you  you explain 

790
00:59:37,109 --> 00:59:41,069
that  Alan clay and Claire Archer were in 

791
00:59:39,21 --> 00:59:43,41
a bitter feud over the contents of a TV

792
00:59:41,069 --> 00:59:46,619
movie script on  dr. arches life is that 

793
00:59:43,41 --> 00:59:49,349
correct  bitter   feud did   I say that I 

794
00:59:46,619 --> 00:59:51,539
 must have misunderstood your question 

795
00:59:49,349 --> 00:59:53,94
 Alan and   claire had a disagreement over 

796
00:59:51,539 --> 00:59:55,619
some scripted  dialogue was more like an 

797
00:59:53,94 --> 00:59:59,099
artistic difference between two

798
00:59:55,619 --> 01:00:02,099
colleagues  em   hardly   what   your statement 

799
00:59:59,099 --> 01:00:05,819
reflects  I just told you I might   have 

800
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:07,469
misunderstood your question  do   I need to 

801
01:00:05,819 --> 01:00:09,029
 remind you mr. silly   that you are under 

802
01:00:07,469 --> 01:00:13,109
oath

803
01:00:09,029 --> 01:00:16,41
 no counselor   you don't in your statement 

804
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:17,7
you said that  Ellen clay and the   writer 

805
01:00:16,41 --> 01:00:20,249
 Freddie summers came to you with   a 

806
01:00:17,7 --> 01:00:22,769
script based on a private investigators

807
01:00:20,249 --> 01:00:24,269
 journal and diary of   dr. archers prior 

808
01:00:22,769 --> 01:00:25,2
involvement with the two associates who

809
01:00:24,269 --> 01:00:28,289
are now dead

810
01:00:25,2 --> 01:00:30,029
is  that true objection your honor I'm 

811
01:00:28,289 --> 01:00:31,829
simply trying to establish that this is

812
01:00:30,029 --> 01:00:32,729
 materially dr. Archer did not want   in 

813
01:00:31,829 --> 01:00:35,16
 the public eye 

814
01:00:32,729 --> 01:00:40,17
overruled  watch   your wording miss 

815
01:00:35,16 --> 01:00:41,579
 Sanders did   you tell Freddie   summers to 

816
01:00:40,17 --> 01:00:44,579
destroy that material

817
01:00:41,579 --> 01:00:46,079
well  I never actually read any   journals 

818
01:00:44,579 --> 01:00:49,89
or diaries the material that  i referred 

819
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:53,319
 to was the written script it just plain 

820
01:00:49,89 --> 01:00:57,099
stunk

821
01:00:53,319 --> 01:00:58,719
 did you or did you not   see that   the 

822
01:00:57,099 --> 01:01:00,219
original summer script  contained 

823
01:00:58,719 --> 01:01:02,68
 accounts that would have condemned and 

824
01:01:00,219 --> 01:01:04,989
 ruin   dr. artist   career 

825
01:01:02,68 --> 01:01:06,009
well  you had nothing   to do with the 

826
01:01:04,989 --> 01:01:07,93
story

827
01:01:06,009 --> 01:01:10,39
what it was about was just bad writing

828
01:01:07,93 --> 01:01:11,89
 if we had used it   it would run all of 

829
01:01:10,39 --> 01:01:17,38
our careers

830
01:01:11,89 --> 01:01:19,9
 Your Honor I think that this witness has 

831
01:01:17,38 --> 01:01:21,249
been  colored objection the   DA has no 

832
01:01:19,9 --> 01:01:23,38
foundation for that kind of allegation

833
01:01:21,249 --> 01:01:25,239
 myths and this   is the witness 

834
01:01:23,38 --> 01:01:29,529
contradicting his  earlier deposition 

835
01:01:25,239 --> 01:01:30,459
 more like manipulating it   your honor 

836
01:01:29,529 --> 01:01:31,66
 perhaps you should   have been more 

837
01:01:30,459 --> 01:01:36,279
specific in your line of questioning

838
01:01:31,66 --> 01:01:37,479
 sustained   then I have no further 

839
01:01:36,279 --> 01:01:42,0
questions

840
01:01:37,479 --> 01:01:47,73
you're dismissed

841
01:01:47,73 --> 01:02:08,72
stand

842
01:01:59,21 --> 01:02:10,099
 your witness counselor   mr. two years   a 

843
01:02:08,72 --> 01:02:12,26
few  moments ago you pointed out my 

844
01:02:10,099 --> 01:02:13,94
client dr. Archer  identifying her as the 

845
01:02:12,26 --> 01:02:16,07
person you saw on the patio on the

846
01:02:16,07 --> 01:02:23,81
oh yes doctor is a very pretty woman

847
01:02:19,94 --> 01:02:25,64
 don't you   think Oh   Jason very picky one 

848
01:02:23,81 --> 01:02:27,74
have  you ever met dr. before I mean 

849
01:02:25,64 --> 01:02:29,75
before that even  know 

850
01:02:27,74 --> 01:02:32,0
 did   you forget the claims before   no no 

851
01:02:29,75 --> 01:02:34,73
 you see the woman sitting in the gallery 

852
01:02:34,73 --> 01:02:37,91
 fran silly to rise 

853
01:02:36,02 --> 01:02:39,109
objection your  honor these people have 

854
01:02:37,91 --> 01:02:41,03
nothing to do with the  eyewitness 

855
01:02:39,109 --> 01:02:41,599
account  mr. Mitchell are you coming to a 

856
01:02:41,03 --> 01:02:44,33
point

857
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:49,6
 yes your honor then get there mrs. 

858
01:02:44,33 --> 01:02:52,72
Sibley

859
01:02:49,6 --> 01:02:55,51
 have you ever seen this woman before 

860
01:02:52,72 --> 01:02:57,13
 no   now from the upstairs window of the 

861
01:02:55,51 --> 01:03:00,22
house  where you   were   working to the 

862
01:02:57,13 --> 01:03:04,12
patio is roughly 200 yards  i said   you 

863
01:03:00,22 --> 01:03:05,95
 agree   i don't know   maybe so 

864
01:03:04,12 --> 01:03:08,11
objection the witness can't be expected

865
01:03:05,95 --> 01:03:09,43
to know the distance between houses

866
01:03:08,11 --> 01:03:13,72
 Your Honor   for the sake of the court the 

867
01:03:09,43 --> 01:03:18,19
distance is exactly 202 yards  noted on 

868
01:03:13,72 --> 01:03:19,66
this  cookie is   it safe to say   the 

869
01:03:18,19 --> 01:03:22,51
distance  between where you are sitting 

870
01:03:19,66 --> 01:03:26,11
 and where I'm standing is a fraction of 

871
01:03:22,51 --> 01:03:29,14
the distance between  two houses   that's 

872
01:03:26,11 --> 01:03:31,27
 so far no now at one point on the 

873
01:03:29,14 --> 01:03:32,95
evening of the  11th France Italy and 

874
01:03:31,27 --> 01:03:35,35
 Beth   clay were both on the tennis court 

875
01:03:32,95 --> 01:03:36,55
of the  play residents   can   you tell me 

876
01:03:35,35 --> 01:03:38,8
from where you're sitting

877
01:03:36,55 --> 01:03:41,14
beyond a shadow of a doubt  which of 

878
01:03:38,8 --> 01:03:42,43
these women  you saw on the tennis court 

879
01:03:41,14 --> 01:03:44,29
objection your honor the witness  is 

880
01:03:42,43 --> 01:03:45,73
already  identified the suspect Your 

881
01:03:44,29 --> 01:03:47,2
Honor if mr.  Gutierrez cannot 

882
01:03:45,73 --> 01:03:48,37
distinguish between these women at the

883
01:03:48,37 --> 01:03:51,97
possibly identify my client at three

884
01:03:50,2 --> 01:03:55,54
times the distance and fading light

885
01:03:51,97 --> 01:03:58,9
 overrules biscuit   areas you may answer 

886
01:03:55,54 --> 01:04:01,21
the question mr.  Gutierrez   can you 

887
01:03:58,9 --> 01:04:10,85
positively identify the woman you saw on

888
01:04:01,21 --> 01:04:13,1
the tennis court that evening

889
01:04:10,85 --> 01:04:14,6
 it's alright   Musketeers   be nearly 

890
01:04:13,1 --> 01:04:17,18
impossible to do so

891
01:04:14,6 --> 01:04:19,22
no further  questions the witness is 

892
01:04:17,18 --> 01:04:32,44
excused  his court will stand in recess

01:04:19,22 --> 01:04:37,3
until  10am   tomorrow

01:04:32,44 --> 01:04:38,77
 why did you do that what   dowhat   alter 

895
01:04:37,3 --> 01:04:42,579
your statement

896
01:04:38,77 --> 01:04:44,829
 Randy leave it   alone don't walk away 

897
01:04:42,579 --> 01:04:46,99
from me  you're not   telling me something 

898
01:04:44,829 --> 01:04:50,319
 I want to know what it is 

899
01:04:46,99 --> 01:04:52,96
why would you risk perjury  from the   DA 

900
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:55,75
misconstrued my statement  and that's all 

901
01:04:52,96 --> 01:04:58,48
 that is a lie 

902
01:04:55,75 --> 01:05:00,64
you and  I are not stupid people we   both 

903
01:04:58,48 --> 01:05:02,2

01:05:00,64 --> 01:05:04,72

905
01:05:02,2 --> 01:05:10,119
thousand times but don't lie to me now

906
01:05:04,72 --> 01:05:13,42

 no i   didn't 

908
01:05:13,42 --> 01:05:18,64
you're always  so convincing 

909
01:05:16,69 --> 01:05:21,099
even when deep down inside  I know the 

910
01:05:18,64 --> 01:05:23,92
truth

911
01:05:21,099 --> 01:05:51,66
 funny i think i prefer it when you lie 

912
01:05:23,92 --> 01:05:58,56
to me

913
01:05:51,66 --> 01:06:02,52

 Simon   look   your   criminal defense 

930
01:09:28,58 --> 01:09:32,54
attorney has it never occurred to you

931
01:09:30,77 --> 01:09:38,089
before  that any of your clients might be 

932
01:09:32,54 --> 01:09:40,01
guilty of course it has  its   not this one 

933
01:09:38,089 --> 01:09:41,48

934
01:09:40,01 --> 01:09:43,67
maze

his knees  let you in on a little secret 

938
01:09:47,27 --> 01:09:51,92
 most attorneys   to give their   eyeteeth 

939
01:09:50,03 --> 01:09:54,38
for a smart client

940
01:09:51,92 --> 01:09:56,96

 private 

993
01:15:24,389 --> 01:15:33,64
 thought I'd find you here 

994
01:15:26,51 --> 01:15:37,93
 you weren't in your office 

995
01:15:33,64 --> 01:15:42,97

996
01:15:37,93 --> 01:15:46,09
you can't very well do that  my client i 

997
01:15:42,97 --> 01:15:54,71
need to confer with my attorney  to 

998
01:15:46,09 --> 01:15:58,28
 someplace we   could go 

999
01:15:54,71 --> 01:15:59,66
 I wanted to be with you so bad last 

1000
01:15:58,28 --> 01:16:04,07
night  I couldn't think of anything else 

1001
01:15:59,66 --> 01:16:05,36
 could have   killed me   and my wife wanted 

1002
01:16:04,07 --> 01:16:07,489
 to make sure you didn't have second 

1003
01:16:05,36 --> 01:16:11,33
thoughts but  our relationship that clear 

1004
01:16:07,489 --> 01:16:17,679
 shouldn't be in here it's   not   gonna   be 

1005
01:16:11,33 --> 01:16:19,3
 anyone here for at least an hour 

1006
01:16:17,679 --> 01:16:33,51
I have to remind you how persuasive I

1007
01:16:19,3 --> 01:16:38,67
can be

1008
01:16:33,51 --> 01:16:41,55
 saw   their clear   Archer left a path of 

1009
01:16:38,67 --> 01:16:42,75
destruction in her wake  enough dead 

1010
01:16:41,55 --> 01:16:46,86
lovers  hear from her   pastor Phil 

1011
01:16:42,75 --> 01:16:49,949
 cemetery but there's no proof that no 

1012
01:16:46,86 --> 01:16:51,179
but  three summers journals and and files 

1013
01:16:49,949 --> 01:16:53,039
about her life are more than enough

1014
01:16:51,179 --> 01:16:54,3
motive for murder  but   it's not enough to 

1015
01:16:53,039 --> 01:16:58,26
get a conviction

1016
01:16:54,3 --> 01:17:00,03
there's more  taped phone threats   there 

1017
01:16:58,26 --> 01:17:01,44
are records of her activities two months

1018
01:17:00,03 --> 01:17:03,929
prior to the death of a psychologist at

1019
01:17:01,44 --> 01:17:10,079
UCLA  there are pictures and phone 

1020
01:17:03,929 --> 01:17:12,659
records and dates she  is   sick 

1021
01:17:10,079 --> 01:17:18,48
she's like a spider she  lures into her 

1022
01:17:12,659 --> 01:17:19,679
web and then she devours I can't take

1023
01:17:18,48 --> 01:17:21,659
this from you  shouldn't even be talking 

1024
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:24,0
to you  I could be disbarred 

1025
01:17:21,659 --> 01:17:25,71
nobody knows  i have this   no one will 

1026
01:17:25,71 --> 01:17:31,739
if you take this  she's gonna walk   and 

1027
01:17:30,929 --> 01:17:38,909
 you   know it 

1028
01:17:31,739 --> 01:17:40,949
 alright alright i'll have my associate 

1029
01:17:38,909 --> 01:17:45,599
 examinees in camera but   I have   to know 

1030
01:17:40,949 --> 01:17:47,07
 why are you doing this because   Helen 

1031
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:50,07
clay will be  your last victim 

1032
01:17:47,07 --> 01:17:54,21
you have to stop her before she does it

1033
01:17:50,07 --> 01:17:56,87
again  I'm taking a huge risk 

1034
01:17:54,21 --> 01:18:01,79
 I just   talked to   worth it 

1035
01:17:56,87 --> 01:18:05,9

your honor  but   i had no   idea it was 

1097
01:24:14,75 --> 01:24:18,08
stolen

1098
01:24:15,59 --> 01:24:20,36
 Your Honor   the material was given to the 

1099
01:24:18,08 --> 01:24:23,389
DA's office  by a disgruntled employee of 

1100
01:24:20,36 --> 01:24:24,739
our law firm  with Sanders   does the 

1101
01:24:23,389 --> 01:24:26,989

1102
01:24:24,739 --> 01:24:30,62
further evidence against dr. Archer

01:24:26,989 --> 01:24:43,44
 other than what we've seen no your honor 

1104
01:24:30,62 --> 01:24:46,26
step back

1105
01:24:43,44 --> 01:24:48,75
 District Attorney Sanders I should cite 

1106
01:24:46,26 --> 01:24:49,98
you for malfeasance  in light of the 

1107
01:24:48,75 --> 01:24:53,91
circumstances brought to the attention

1108
01:24:49,98 --> 01:24:55,739
of this  court   the evidence submitted by 

1109
01:24:53,91 --> 01:24:58,44
the prosecution was obtained by any

1110
01:24:55,739 --> 01:25:00,84
illegal search and seizure and an

1111
01:24:58,44 --> 01:25:02,489
unlawful  ex parte communication between 

1112
01:25:00,84 --> 01:25:05,52
the district attorney's office and a

1113
01:25:02,489 --> 01:25:09,12
member of the defense team and it is

1114
01:25:05,52 --> 01:25:11,1
therefore inadmissible  since the 

1115
01:25:09,12 --> 01:25:14,46
prosecution has failed to come up with

1116
01:25:11,1 --> 01:25:17,04
further evidence against dr. Archer and

1117
01:25:14,46 --> 01:25:20,4
in light of the extenuating

1118
01:25:17,04 --> 01:26:12,989
circumstances  this case is dismissed 

1119
01:25:20,4 --> 01:28:40,19
with prejudice  defendant is free to go 

1120
01:26:12,989 --> 01:28:46,15

1121
01:28:40,19 --> 01:28:46,15
 ok
