1598
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:35,933
Josh, I don't know how to
thank you.

1599
01:24:35,933 --> 01:24:37,967
You don't have to. That's
what families do.

1600
01:24:37,967 --> 01:24:39,267
I think you know that now.

1601
01:24:39,267 --> 01:24:41,100
Yeah, but I really
appreciate it.

1602
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:42,233
Can I go home yet? [

1603
01:24:42,233 --> 01:24:43,867
No, I don't appreciate that
much.

1604
01:24:43,867 --> 01:24:49,867
We got more work to do.

1605
01:24:49,867 --> 01:24:52,067
Oh, Rachel.

1606
01:24:52,067 --> 01:24:53,800
This is what you taught me.

1607
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:55,833
The most important things in
life aren't things.

1608
01:24:55,833 --> 01:24:57,700
Aren't things.

1609
01:24:57,700 --> 01:24:59,733
Amen!

1610
01:24:59,733 --> 01:25:02,067
And the best part is I got
it at a yard sale for 2
dollars.

1611
01:25:02,067 --> 01:25:08,733
That's almost free.

1612
01:25:08,733 --> 01:25:09,467
Dad?

1613
01:25:09,467 --> 01:25:11,833
Yeah, honey?

1614
01:25:11,833 --> 01:25:13,433
You're right.

1615
01:25:13,433 --> 01:25:15,067
I don't need a boyfriend.

1616
01:25:15,067 --> 01:25:16,533
I just wanna let you know.

1617
01:25:16,533 --> 01:25:18,067
That's my girl.

1618
01:25:18,067 --> 01:25:21,100
I'm proud of you sweetheart.

1619
01:25:21,100 --> 01:25:22,267
Matt?

1620
01:25:22,267 --> 01:25:23,833
Yeah, mom?

1621
01:25:23,833 --> 01:25:25,433
I love you.

1622
01:25:25,433 --> 01:25:26,867
I love you too, mom.

1623
01:25:26,867 --> 01:25:28,267
Look I'm sorry I put you in
that position.

1624
01:25:28,267 --> 01:25:30,467
Let me finish.

1625
01:25:30,467 --> 01:25:35,300
Matt, you and your family are
so precious to me.

1626
01:25:35,300 --> 01:25:37,567
I hope you know that.

1627
01:25:37,567 --> 01:25:42,300
Yours and Josh's family are my
legacy

1628
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:45,067
and you're my reason for
living.

1629
01:25:45,067 --> 01:25:48,933
And I want you to know that
it's been a great wonderful
privilege

1630
01:25:48,933 --> 01:25:53,700
to watch you grow into a man
and into a father

1631
01:25:53,700 --> 01:25:57,700
and into a servant of the
lord.

1632
01:25:57,700 --> 01:26:01,533
I know your father is so proud
of you.

1633
01:26:01,533 --> 01:26:04,367
And I also know he's looking
down on you

1634
01:26:04,367 --> 01:26:09,633
and really feeling the joy
that I feel too.

1635
01:26:09,633 --> 01:26:11,967
I just had so much in my
heart.

1636
01:26:11,967 --> 01:26:14,267
I had to let it spill out.

1637
01:26:14,267 --> 01:26:18,933
I love you to mom.

1638
01:26:18,933 --> 01:26:20,867
Looks, great. I hope you
guys are hungry.

1639
01:26:20,867 --> 01:26:22,067
It's really good.

01:26:22,067 --> 01:26:23,900
>>Nice job mom!

1641
01:26:23,900 --> 01:26:25,267
What are you doing?

1642
01:26:25,267 --> 01:26:27,933
I thought that was for
decoration?

1643
01:26:27,933 --> 01:26:35,300
It is. But, you know, this
candle represents who I was,

1644
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:39,300
beautiful maybe, but not very
useful.

1645
01:26:39,300 --> 01:26:41,533
It had a better chance of
melting

in storage done bringing down
from use.

1647
01:26:44,833 --> 01:26:47,700
I wanna burn myself out from
use.

1648
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:51,067
I want to let my light so
shine before men

1649
01:26:51,067 --> 01:26:52,400
that they may see my good
works

1650
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:55,533
and glorify my father which is
in heaven.

1651
01:26:55,533 --> 01:26:58,500
I can't tell you how grateful
I am for these difficult trials

1652
01:26:58,500 --> 01:27:01,533
that we've been through for
the last couple of months.

1653

If everything haven't fallen
apart we could have never

rebuilt our lives so
beautifully.
