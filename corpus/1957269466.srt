There are among us a people,

00:00:56,222 --> 00:01:00,193
gifted with a perfect memory
of all their past lives.

00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,897

Infinites.

for the protection and growth
of all humanity.

00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,046
Against them
stand the Nihilists,

10
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:22,949
who see this power
as a curse.

to end all life on earth.

of question marks
in your past.

And they'd be greeted
with a smile.

I have had some issues
in the past.

I did
a full background check
on you, Mr. McCauley.

I spoke to some
of your past employers.

And you know what?
They all said
the same thing.

99

I'm interested to hear
what they had to say.

100
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:19,692
They say you're great!

101
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,361
They say you're smart.
He's a smart guy.

00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:28,301

I guess I've got the job then.
When do I start?

Tell me about the customer
you attacked.

He assaulted a waitress.

106
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,308
So you broke his arm.

107
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:37,510
I did.
It was unintentional.

108
00:09:37,576 --> 00:09:41,013
Excuse me,
but he grabbed her ass.

109
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,015
I asked him to leave politely.

110
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:46,686
He put his hands on me.
No charges were ever filed.
Everything was dismissed.

111
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:53,025
So you just walked out
of a shift at Locanda
and you-- you never came back?

That was six years ago.

that you were institutionalized.

with mental illness
are a part of my past.

as an eye twitch since.

118
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:15,114
I think, if anything, getting
through what I've been through
only makes me stronger.

119
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:20,252
And I am 100% confident
in my ability to manage here.

what it looks like.

00:10:24,623 --> 00:10:27,393
But my illness isn't an issue
you have to worry about.

Hey, we'll be
in touch, okay?

Thanks for coming in.

130
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:53,819
But you're right.
I don't think I will need
to be calling you.

131
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,422
You think you know my story

132
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,757
because you ran
a background check

133
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,759
and made a couple
of phone calls?

134
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:03,562

your well-moisturized hand.

wanna talk to shrinks

00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:42,555
What's the capital
of "Brakina Fatso"?
[Ronny] Yeah.

174
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:46,425
It's pronounced
"Burkina Faso." Ouagadougou.
Could I have my pills, please?

175
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,494
[all laughing]

176
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:50,996
Shit, man.
Forgot my count, man.

177
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:52,731
You made that up.

178
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,735
Damn, man!

179
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,405
[laughing]
Nah.

180
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:03,309
Homeboy knows everything.
He a freak.

181
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:05,511
How do you know so much?

182
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:08,814
Honestly, I wish I knew.
Makes me nuts.

183
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:10,883
Could I have my pills, please.

184
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:18,724
Dang, girl.
You eyeballin' my boy
like he a steak dinner.

185
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:23,529
[man] Yo, yo.
What's gunpowder made of?

186
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:27,299
74% potassium nitrate,
13% charcoal.

187
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:30,469
Okay.
Damn. Impressive, man.

188
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,771
[laughs]

189
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,908
I said eyes on me.

190
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:37,876
Come on, Ronny.

191
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:40,713
There you go, man.
Sixty packages.

192
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:42,715
That's only 55.

193
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,750
For real?

194
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:46,852
Close enough.

195
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,555
The hell it is.
I live on those.

196
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:52,324
Sixty. Hey.

197
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,559
[grunts]
Hey.

198
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:56,061
You want the real thing,
right? That is it.

199
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:59,331
That's folded over 70 times.
Carbon-treated steel.

200
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,000
Take your damn hands off me.

201
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,736
[cocks gun]
You better tell your boy
to learn how to count.

202
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:05,504
The deal is for 60 bags.

203
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,674
Yeah?
Well, that's all we got.

204
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:12,077
You don't like it,
you can go back to Bellevue.

205
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,414
Get the gat on homeboy.

206
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:18,584
[cocks gun]
I wanna test this shit out.

207
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:25,858
Yo, what's gunpowder
made of?

208
00:15:25,924 --> 00:15:27,092
[Ronny] Hold out your arm.

209
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,794
Showtime.

210
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,898
Hold out your arm.

211
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:37,036
Get up.

212
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:40,906
Put your arm there, huh?
It's the neck or arm, baby.

213
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:43,075
You choose.

214
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:45,611
Hey, Ronny.
That's not a toy, bro.

215
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:46,945
Mind your business, Evan.

216
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:48,981
Come on, Ronny.
This ain't funny.

217
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:59,625
[grunts] Oh, God!
My fingers!

218
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:01,894
[Shawna whimpers]
[groans]

219
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,395
I think it works,
huh, Ronny?

220
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,464
Cut my goddamn fingers off, man!

221
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:09,101
You'll be all right.
Hey, sweetheart,
why don't you head on home now.

222
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:10,936
[Ronny]
You're trippin', bro.

223
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:13,472
You are done, homey.
You're a dead fool.

224
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:15,874
I don't know, Ronny.
You're talking to a guy

225
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:18,043
who buys antipsychotic
medication from you.

226
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:21,080
I'm feeling
a little unbalanced
right now.

227
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:24,583
Maybe the best way
to get the voices in my head
to stop talking

228
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,918
is to cut yours off.

229
00:16:25,984 --> 00:16:27,853
Do you think it would help?

230
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:31,890
No. Don't fight.
Don't shoot.
It's cool.

231
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:33,759
We're cool, man.
We're cool. All right?

232
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:37,496
Hey, dickhead.
Grab my pills. Now.

233
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:38,831
There you go.

234
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:40,799
[Ronny] You're crazy, man.

235
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:44,002
If I was crazy,
I'd have chopped you up in
little pieces a long time ago.

236
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:45,504
Give me my pills.

237
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:49,108
Now, you listen to me, Ronny.
I'm not crazy, okay?

238
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:52,311
Mm-hmm.
I'm just misunderstood.
All right?

239
00:16:57,816 --> 00:16:59,051
[gunshot]

240
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:13,832
[car alarm blaring]

241
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:19,204
[police sirens wailing]

242
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,633
Help!
Leona!

243
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,505
[grunting]
Oh!

244
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,907
[gasps]

245
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:19,932
[sirens wailing]

246
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:26,905
NYPD picked up
an Evan McCauley.
Drug deal gone south.

247
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:30,075
Cops found a sword on him.

248
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:32,878
Blade was made with a process

249
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:36,215
hasn't been used
since, uh, Edo Japan.

250
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,550
[woman] So?

251
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,953
He claims he forged it himself.

252
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:43,555
Another broker-turned-hipster
blacksmith.

253
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,792
Oh, ye of little faith.
Are you seeing this, Nora?

254
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:50,729
Treadway?
Precisely.

255
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:54,099
If we know, Bathurst knows.

256
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,201
Be careful.

257
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:57,970
Thanks, Mom.

258
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:08,313
[door opens]

259
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:21,827
Tell us
when you're done, sir.

260
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:23,962
[Evan]
Can I get my phone call?

261
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:27,633
Supposed to get
a phone call.

262
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,572
[chuckles]

263
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:44,216
You're dressed way too nice
to be an NYPD detective, so...

264
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,019
must be a doctor.

265
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,355
Not a thing?

266
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,992
No recognition at all?

267
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:58,931
I think
I should feel hurt.
[chuckles]

268
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:04,937
Do you remember... Syracuse?

269
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:06,805
Syracuse.

270
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,106
The siege.

271
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:11,109
Second Punic War.

272
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,046
Where we first met.

273
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:17,182
Well, not quite the thrill ride
of the First Punic War,

274
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:19,685
but, hey,
sequels are tough, huh?

275
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:21,687
You disappoint me.

276
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:23,822
Well, join the club.

277
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,390
I notice...

278
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:28,393
you didn't sign it.

279
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,398
[laughs] Then again...

280
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,302
craftsmanship like this...

281
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:41,740
you didn't need to, did you?

282
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:44,710
I made a sword.
Is that a crime?

283
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:48,213
[sword hits table]
Evan McCauley.

284
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:52,417
Diagnosed with schizophrenia
at 14...

285
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:56,254
after carving the words
"Look inside"

286
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:59,725
into your chest
with a box cutter.

287
00:21:00,258 --> 00:21:03,862
Electroshock proved unhelpful.

288
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,430
But these...

289
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,300
are not bad, eh?

290
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:15,774
Doctor, can I--
Please. Go ahead.

291
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:22,948
At 16, attempted suicide
via car crash,

292
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:26,251
necessitating the steel plate
in your skull.

293
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:29,221
Spent the rest
of your early life

294
00:21:29,287 --> 00:21:33,392
bouncing around
between psych hospitals
and foster homes.

295
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,727
Well, I only cut
a couple of his fingers off.

296
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:38,964
I don't think I'm gonna need
to plead insanity on this one,
am I, Doctor?

297
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:40,298
I'm curious.

298
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,135
"Look inside."

299
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,039
Why those words?
Why not?

300
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:16,735
Which one of these...
is yours?

301
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:20,772
You can skip the--
whatever the hell this is

302
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,508
because none of that
is mine.

303
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:29,147
You're not supposed
to have that in here.

304
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:38,757
What's going on here?

305
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:40,759
Hey, Officer.

306
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:02,047
Hey, what the hell
is going on here?

307
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:09,187
Pick it up.

308
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,056
What?

309
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:13,391
Pick it up.

310
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:20,365
Paris.

311
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:22,267
1794.

312
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:25,303
The last meal
of the Comte d'Anjou.

313
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,276
A Bordeaux.

314
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,412
Not a bad choice
for a last meal.

315
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:36,815
Was it yours?

316
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:41,553
I wish I knew
what you were talking about,
but I don't know what to tell--

317
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,021
Jesus!

318
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,390
Every time you say,
"I don't know,"

319
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:48,493
this trigger
gets pulled.

320
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:55,033
Is it yours?
I don't know--

321
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,902
Are you out of your mind?

322
00:23:56,968 --> 00:23:59,204
We're in a police station!
Hello! Officer!
The room is soundproof!

323
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:04,609
They won't even hear it
when I put 250 grams of lead
through the back of your skull.

324
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:13,385
Is it yours?
Yes. Okay, yes, it's mine.

325
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:14,886
Are you happy?
[trigger clicks]

326
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,121
Jesus!

327
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:20,292
Lying... won't help.

328
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:25,530
Look. I'm just a guy
who was at the wrong place
at the wrong time. That's all.

329
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:27,299
Last chance, Evan.

330
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:32,470
Is... it... yours?

00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:06,658
Hold tight.
Oh, sh...

350
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:12,430
[grunts]

351
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:18,770
[officer]
Cover!

352
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:22,607
What are you waiting for?
Come on, let's go!

353
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:24,576
Go the other way!
Take the wheel.

354
00:27:24,642 --> 00:27:26,444
What?
[policeman] Get out of the car!

355
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:29,647
Yeah, sure.
Retractable steering wheel.
No problem. That's normal.

356
00:27:32,617 --> 00:27:35,220
Reverse.
Shoot that son of a bitch.

357
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:43,261
[clamoring]
Move! Clear the street!

358
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,330
Shoot the driver!

359
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,469
Jesus Christ!

360
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,342
[policeman] Who are they?

361
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:02,747
Relax, it's bulletproof.

362
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:07,852
180 now!

363
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,371
Don't stop.

364
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:35,180
[man yelling]

365
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:38,183
[men screaming]

366
00:28:53,631 --> 00:28:55,733
[policemen yelling]

367
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,407
[grunts]

368
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:12,550
Can I ask you a question?
Yeah, sure.

369
00:29:12,617 --> 00:29:13,885
Who the hell are you?

370
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:15,520
I'm Nora Brightman.

371
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,856
Okay. But who was
that dude back there?

372
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:20,391
Bathurst.
You didn't recognize him?

373
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:22,560
No, I didn't.
But clearly you did.

374
00:29:22,627 --> 00:29:24,529
Well, you've known him
a long time.

375
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,599
I've never seen that man
before in my life.
Him, I think I'd remember.

376
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:29,701
Well, not in this life,
maybe.

377
00:29:29,767 --> 00:29:31,870
Oh, no. Maybe I bumped into him
during the Second Punic War?

378
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:34,372
Or maybe it was
the French Revolution.
I'm bad with dates.

379
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:37,542
You remember that?
No. I don't remember
the French Revolution.

380
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:40,278
I figured it out.
I see now. I get it.

381
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:42,547
You do?
None of this is real.

382
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:44,415
It's a psychotic break.

383
00:29:44,482 --> 00:29:46,885
I'm gonna wake up
in a hospital somewhere,
drooling all over myself,

384
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,953
strung out on lithium.
Is that easier to believe

385
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,356
than the idea that maybe
destiny has something
more in store for you?

386
00:29:51,422 --> 00:29:54,726
Destiny? Where I come from,
we got bills to pay,
rent to make.

387
00:29:54,792 --> 00:29:57,595
Nobody's got time for destiny.
That's a shame.

388
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:15,747
I know you've been
looking for answers,
Evan.

389
00:30:15,813 --> 00:30:17,982
But you're not crazy.
You never have been.

390
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:20,952
No, I'm not crazy.
I'm just delusional.

391
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:23,588
Do you ever find yourself
drawn to places
you've never been?

392
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:26,591
Do you ever see
a picture of a place
and just know you've been there?

393
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:27,825
Do you know things
you shouldn't?

394
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:29,928
Do you pick up things fast,
almost as if

395
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:32,764
you're remembering skills,
not learning them?

396
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,799
I've told
a dozen therapists this.

397
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:37,435
I've been analyzed
every way possible,
a hundred times over.

398
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:38,770
It doesn't mean anything.

399
00:30:38,836 --> 00:30:41,272
Do you dream
in other languages?

400
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:44,475
[speaks Russian,
Japanese]

401
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:47,679
That's what schizophrenia is.
Different people, same head.

402
00:30:47,745 --> 00:30:51,316
What if it were
the same person,
different lives?

403
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:54,285
You're talking
about reincarnation.
Yeah.

404
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,821
You can forge a sword
because you were
a blacksmith.

405
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:59,824
You speak Russian
because you were Russian.

406
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:01,626
Look, I hate to break it to you.

407
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:04,696
It's a comforting idea,
souls moving from one body
to the next.

408
00:31:04,762 --> 00:31:08,633
But it's basically just
a spiritual equivalent of
"better luck next time." Okay?

409
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,468
Nothing more and nothing less.

410
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:13,471
Feel safe warm and inside
all that cynicism?
I do, actually.

411
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,807
And how's that
working out for you?
In the grand scheme of things?

412
00:31:15,873 --> 00:31:17,709
Like big-picture shit?
Not so great.

413
00:31:17,775 --> 00:31:19,877
But I'm good. I'm surviving.

414
00:31:20,945 --> 00:31:25,516
The visions you've had
your entire life, Evan,
aren't hallucinations.

415
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:26,918
They're memories.

416
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:30,655
So, you're saying
that a hundred doctors
were wrong?

417
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:35,627
Fifty medications didn't work
because I'm really a
reincarnated Russian blacksmith?

418
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,562
This is real.

419
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:40,331
I'm real.

420
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:43,735
Oh, yeah? This is
no version of reincarnation
I've ever heard of.

421
00:31:43,801 --> 00:31:45,069
Buddhist, Hindu, Sikh.

422
00:31:45,136 --> 00:31:47,905
They believe each life begins
with a clean slate.

423
00:31:47,972 --> 00:31:50,975
The answers you've been
looking for all your life...

424
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:55,079
all you gotta do
is get on that plane.

425
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:00,652
You know what I'm really
asking myself right now is?

426
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:04,022
What if the craziest thing
I've ever heard--
and this is some crazy shit--

427
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:06,891
is actually
the first thing that's
ever made any goddamn sense?

428
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:13,798
I don't gotta go feed the cat,
so... let's go.

429
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:37,121
[speaking Italian]

430
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:42,427
Go on.

431
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:48,866
[speaking,
gurgling, choking]

432
00:32:51,969 --> 00:32:54,772
[speaking, gurgling,
choking continue]

433
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:03,748
[gasping]

434
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,150
[woman] They left
from a private airport.

435
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:08,152
It was an unlisted flight.

436
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:11,155
She was there fast.

437
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:14,659
Too fast.

438
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:18,463
The sword hadn't been
in the system
for more than a few hours.

439
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:20,998
Then they have a base
here in New York.
I want it found.

440
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:24,602
It will lead us
to Evan McCauley.

441
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,604
He will lead us
to the Egg.

442
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,172
Again.

443
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:31,876
[speaking Latin]

444
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:37,181
[continues speaking
in Latin]

445
00:33:40,918 --> 00:33:42,920
[shouting, choking]

446
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:50,862
[Nora] We call ourselves
the Infinite.

447
00:33:50,928 --> 00:33:53,531
Less than 500 souls
from across the globe,

448
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:57,802
all born with the ability
to remember all our past lives

449
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:00,671
and the skills we've learned
in each of them.

450
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:02,507
There are two groups
within the Infinites:

451
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:07,478
Bathurst and the Nihilists,
who just want the world to end,

452
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,914
and us... the Believers.

453
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:12,150
And what is it
that we believe?

454
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:15,953
We believe that our gift
is a responsibility.

455
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,790
That it's up to us
to leave humanity

456
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:21,559
better off than we found it.
Yeah.

457
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:24,896
I think
I'm gonna need these.

458
00:34:57,728 --> 00:35:00,031
Hey.
Hey.

459
00:35:00,097 --> 00:35:01,132
Thanks.

460
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:05,570
Wow. It's a long way
from Arthur Avenue.

461
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:06,838
[chuckles]

462
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:09,106
It always blows
my mind.

463
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:12,176
We call it the Hub.

464
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:20,017
This is the place
where you're gonna get
your memories back, Evan.

465
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,988
We'll be landing soon.

466
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:43,307
Recognize anything?
I'm pretty sure
I'd remember this.

467
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:46,043
It used to be dedicated
to scientific research.

468
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:48,246
Anthropology and linguistics.

469
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:50,615
All of us using
what we've learned.

470
00:35:50,681 --> 00:35:53,918
Life after life
for the advancement
of mankind.

471
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,319
And what is it now?

472
00:35:56,153 --> 00:35:59,323
Headquarters
for the losing side
in the war.

473
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:03,895
[shouting, grunting]

474
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:06,264
Bathurst is the master
of combat.

475
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,899
Hundreds of lifetimes.

476
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:18,342
You must be prepared
for everything.

477
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:28,920
He's the apex predator
in our world.

478
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,224
Again.

479
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:41,065
[speaking Japanese]

480
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,367
Why are they bowing?

481
00:36:43,434 --> 00:36:46,037
They're hoping
you're Heinrich Treadway.

482
00:36:46,103 --> 00:36:48,172
[instructor] Again!
Reincarnated.

483
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:50,007
"Heinrich"?

484
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:52,310
It was a popular name
in the '50s.

485
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:53,477
In the '50s.

486
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:57,281
Great for rock 'n' roll,
but lousy for names,
I guess.

487
00:36:57,348 --> 00:36:59,650
The 1750s.

488
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,118
[instructor grunts]

489
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:05,122
What do I know
that you need so bad?

490
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:08,125
That's why you're here--
to find out.

491
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:12,897
[grunting continues]

492
00:37:31,248 --> 00:37:35,219
This is Treadway's room.
Are you asking me
or telling me?

493
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:38,723
I must've really screwed up
on my last incarnation.

494
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:40,224
Why would you say that?

495
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:43,260
Have you seen where I live
in this life?

496
00:37:49,266 --> 00:37:52,236
That's Treadway's
Himalaya diary.

497
00:37:56,073 --> 00:37:57,942
That was me.

498
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:00,411
When I was Leona Warrick.

499
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:04,281
And that was Treadway.

500
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:07,084
[Leona screams]

501
00:38:07,151 --> 00:38:09,186
[gasping]
[grunts]

502
00:38:09,253 --> 00:38:10,755
[gasps]

503
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,958
Two days after that picture
was taken,

504
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:15,960
Treadway saved my life.

505
00:38:17,028 --> 00:38:19,964
There's a reason
you picked that book.

506
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:23,200
All this tells me
is what he did.

507
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:25,236
None of it tells me
who he was.

508
00:38:25,302 --> 00:38:28,205
Here we can study
anything and everything.

509
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:31,809
Space, time, scale.
It's all relevant.

510
00:38:32,376 --> 00:38:34,412
That doesn't seem
like much.

511
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,914
[woman]
Welcome to my virtual sandbox.

512
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,783
Name's Garrick.
Hi.

513
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:41,152
Garrick is our head
of technology and research.

514
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:43,287
He doesn't
look like much.

515
00:38:43,954 --> 00:38:46,123
Goddamn, it's good
to see you again.

516
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:48,759
It's nice to meet you too.

517
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:52,396
Don't worry.
All this shit,
it just gets weirder.

518
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:53,898
Okay.

519
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:55,266
Now let's get started.

520
00:38:55,332 --> 00:38:56,333
Follow me.

521
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:01,505
Stand there for me,
please.

522
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:03,340
Okay.

523
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:12,483
[hologram powers up]

524
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:22,293
That's the guy
from the police station.

525
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:25,529
[Garrick] Bathurst.
He and Treadway
were once friends.

526
00:39:26,063 --> 00:39:28,032
A dozen lifetimes.
Wars, peace.

527
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:31,769
They stood together at
some of the greatest moments
in human history.

528
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,305
Then Bathurst lost faith.

529
00:39:34,371 --> 00:39:38,342
For the last 300 years,
he's been looking
for a way out.

530
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:41,178
He needed a way
to stop reincarnating.

531
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:43,114
He wants it all to end.

532
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:45,516
[Garrick]
That's why he made this.

533
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:20,284
[Garrick] The Egg,
designed to kill every
living thing on earth.

534
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:23,387
[Evan]
That seems a little drastic.

535
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:25,489
[Nora]
If there's nothing left alive,

536
00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:28,492
there's nothing left
to reincarnate into.

537
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:35,166
[Garrick]
It attacks life
at the source-- DNA--

538
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:37,868
unwinding the very fabric
of existence.

539
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:41,939
Every plant, every animal
every person.

540
00:40:42,006 --> 00:40:43,040
Mama!

541
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,875
[woman]
Jordan!

542
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:47,878
[people yelling, screaming]

543
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:49,313
I'm coming!

544
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:56,020
[screams]

545
00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:57,588
[Nora]
Like unplugging a computer

546
00:40:57,655 --> 00:40:59,423
when a program freezes.

547
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,258
[Garrick]
Only when he pulls this plug,

548
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:03,861
seven billion people
will go with him.

549
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:08,132
Everything it kills
accelerates the process.

550
00:41:12,436 --> 00:41:16,207
God! Holy shit,
that felt freakin' real!

551
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:19,143
Without you, none of us
would be here right now.

552
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:20,411
What are you
talking about?

553
00:41:20,477 --> 00:41:23,214
Last cycle,
you raided Bathurst's lab,

554
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,483
stole the Egg,
killed his Einstein and
everyone who helped build it,

555
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:28,586
leaving him with no way
to recreate it.

556
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:32,256
You took the secret
of the Egg's whereabouts
to your grave.

557
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:35,226
Bathurst spent
this entire lifetime
looking for it.

558
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:38,596
And he's getting closer
and closer to finding it
every day.

559
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:40,931
That's why he
tracked you down
in New York.

560
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:43,434
So I get on the plane,
you get all my memories back,

561
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,502
and I save
the whole entire world,
right? That's it?

562
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:47,104
That's pretty much
basically it, right?

563
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,073
Told you it was
gonna get weird.

564
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:50,474
So, what now?

565
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:52,543
[phone rings]

566
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:56,013
Tell me good news, Nora.

567
00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:00,251
[Bathurst] Bryan Porter.
Treadway had a gift
with steel, didn't he?

568
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:04,688
Impeccable. Your friends
in the NYPD were certainly
impressed with it.

569
00:42:04,755 --> 00:42:09,193
Unfortunately,
their encryption skills
are less than impeccable.

570
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,662
Led us right to you.

571
00:42:11,729 --> 00:42:15,399
[screaming]

572
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:19,436
[groaning]

573
00:42:22,106 --> 00:42:25,542
You do know we have easier ways
of doing things now, right?

574
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,411
Newer...

575
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:30,714
almost never means better.

576
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:43,294
We're going to uncover
Evan McCauley's location.

577
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,562
We'll brute-force
your encryption.

578
00:42:46,764 --> 00:42:50,567
But I'd consider it...
a courtesy...

579
00:42:51,602 --> 00:42:52,636
if you just...

580
00:42:54,204 --> 00:42:55,639
sped the process up.

581
00:42:58,575 --> 00:43:00,477
[chuckles]
Tell us where he is.

582
00:43:01,812 --> 00:43:04,748
[groaning]

583
00:43:08,452 --> 00:43:10,754
[coughing]
Okay.

584
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:13,757
I know where he is.

585
00:43:14,825 --> 00:43:16,694
[coughing continues]

586
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,995
Of course I do.

587
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:22,433
I know exactly where he is.
I just...

588
00:43:25,402 --> 00:43:27,204
I, um...

589
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:31,342
I sometimes have difficulties...

590
00:43:31,408 --> 00:43:33,110
[whispering] with my memory.

591
00:43:33,177 --> 00:43:34,278
[whispers]
Memory.

592
00:43:34,345 --> 00:43:36,046
[groans]
I remember

593
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:38,349
when you used to
gather honey

594
00:43:38,415 --> 00:43:40,584
on the fields
of Marathon.

595
00:43:40,651 --> 00:43:41,719
[groaning]

596
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:46,657
Just another reminder
of how nothing
stays the same.

597
00:43:47,825 --> 00:43:49,493
[groans]

598
00:43:50,861 --> 00:43:52,296
[groaning]

599
00:43:56,633 --> 00:43:58,502
Would you care
for some?

600
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,743
You know what
real torture is?

601
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:07,311
Listening to you?

602
00:44:07,378 --> 00:44:12,416
[laughs] Real torture...
isn't physical pain,

603
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:15,285
but human stupidity.

604
00:44:15,352 --> 00:44:18,722
Being surrounded by it,
engulfed in it.

605
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:21,558
[groans]
Lifetime after lifetime.

606
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:25,429
[gurgling]
People with their
idiot grins!

607
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:28,098
Their infuriating
pleasantries!

608
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:30,134
Their need for approval!

609
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:33,804
Their unctuous attempts
to be loved and validated!

610
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:37,608
They are walking,
talking obituaries...

611
00:44:37,674 --> 00:44:40,778
[groaning]
...on the back page
of a dying newspaper,

612
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:44,782
at the bottom of a birdcage,
in the corner of
a filthy living room

613
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:45,783
of a hoarder cat lady!

614
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:48,786
And we are forced...
You'll never understand...

615
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:52,256
...to live amongst them over...
...friendship, love.

616
00:44:52,322 --> 00:44:53,824
...and over endlessly.

617
00:44:53,891 --> 00:44:56,360
That is the true...
You still don't understand
about faith!

618
00:44:56,427 --> 00:44:58,128
...definition of torture.

619
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:01,532
Faith! Blah, blah, blah!

620
00:45:01,598 --> 00:45:02,766
Faith!

621
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:05,102
[whispers] Faith.

622
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:09,139
I'm tired of faith.

623
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:12,743
God must show me
his face.

624
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:29,860
But thank you...
for enlightening me.

625
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:33,764
[Porter screams, faint]

626
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:49,513
You kept
his fucking body?

627
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,881
Sexy son of a bitch,
isn't he?

628
00:45:50,948 --> 00:45:52,850
No. He's a dead guy
floating in water.

629
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:54,852
That's pretty much
my worst nightmare.

630
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:57,754
Actually,
it's a crotonic acid matrix.
Keeps the cells alive.

631
00:45:57,821 --> 00:45:59,890
Oh. That makes it
that much better.
Thank you.

632
00:45:59,957 --> 00:46:03,427
We're trying to understand
the science behind what we are.

633
00:46:05,729 --> 00:46:06,763
[beeps]

634
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:14,605
[Nora] Treadway believed
that humans are capable of
so much more than we realized.

635
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:17,674
[Evan] Is this what
you're telling me? I'm not
living up to my potential?

636
00:46:17,741 --> 00:46:19,710
I've heard that speech before.

637
00:46:19,776 --> 00:46:23,947
[Garrick] Treadway pushed
past boundaries others might
call paranormal, superhuman.

638
00:46:24,014 --> 00:46:26,884
He can manipulate the energy
of the world around him.

639
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,685
[Evan] I don't even know
what that means.

640
00:46:28,752 --> 00:46:30,587
[Garrick] What it means
is you'll have skills

641
00:46:30,654 --> 00:46:33,390
beyond anything
you've ever imagined.

642
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:35,626
Those abilities
are very deep.

643
00:46:35,692 --> 00:46:37,728
Below the conscious level.

644
00:46:37,794 --> 00:46:41,298
[Evan] I'm down.
How do we get them back?

645
00:46:41,365 --> 00:46:42,799
[grunting]

646
00:46:42,866 --> 00:46:45,402
[Nora] Here,
we retrain your memory.

647
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:49,273
We combine the physical
and the mental to develop
new neural pathways.

648
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:59,850
Memories are held
in every organ...

649
00:47:00,717 --> 00:47:02,619
every cell in your body.

650
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:14,998
Regression takes
the kind of concentration
it takes years to develop.

651
00:47:15,065 --> 00:47:16,700
This is a shortcut.

652
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:21,004
We shock your mind
into synching with the system.

653
00:47:29,413 --> 00:47:30,914
[grunting]

654
00:47:31,481 --> 00:47:32,649
[yells]

655
00:47:52,603 --> 00:47:57,774
[Garrick] It's working.
I'm seeing increased activity
in all his memory centers.

656
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:07,351
[yells]

657
00:48:30,474 --> 00:48:31,708
Hey!

658
00:48:39,983 --> 00:48:41,818
[groaning]

659
00:48:48,492 --> 00:48:50,961
[grunts]
Come on.

660
00:48:52,729 --> 00:48:55,032
That's not Treadway.
Really?

661
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:56,600
He just beat you.

662
00:48:56,667 --> 00:48:58,835
Treadway would've killed me.

663
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:01,672
[groans]

664
00:49:05,742 --> 00:49:10,447
Wow. She wasn't kidding
about being at war, huh?

665
00:49:10,514 --> 00:49:12,949
Improving
the human condition.

666
00:49:13,016 --> 00:49:16,420
Sometimes you do it
by painting
a chapel ceiling.

667
00:49:16,486 --> 00:49:18,789
Yeah. And sometimes
you drop them
from a mile out.

668
00:49:18,855 --> 00:49:20,957
Don't touch that.

669
00:49:21,024 --> 00:49:22,759
Okay, okay.

670
00:49:25,962 --> 00:49:28,565
That's no gun
I've ever seen before.

671
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:32,069
We're reverse-engineering
Bathurst's Dethroner.

672
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:36,606
A Dethroner?
I mean, dude, who's
coming up with these names?

673
00:49:36,673 --> 00:49:37,874
Look...

674
00:49:38,675 --> 00:49:41,545
you can't kill an Infinite.
You kill the body, but...

675
00:49:41,611 --> 00:49:44,481
And they get reincarnated?
Yeah.

676
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:48,919
This implants in your head

677
00:49:48,985 --> 00:49:51,788
and pulls out
your consciousness...

678
00:49:52,856 --> 00:49:55,759
your soul,
and onto a digital chip.

679
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:58,395
Your soul gets stuck on a disk
and breaks the cycle.

680
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:03,133
Over 200 of our brothers
and sisters are lost

681
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,502
in that digital purgatory.

682
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:08,839
[exhales]
You come face to face
with this,

683
00:50:08,905 --> 00:50:13,176
my advice--
find a way to die
the old-fashioned way.

684
00:50:16,713 --> 00:50:18,315
[knocking]
Come in.

685
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:24,454
Okay if I look around?

686
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:26,189
Be my guest.

687
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,878
These are all you,
aren't they?

688
00:50:48,845 --> 00:50:50,947
They're people I once was.

689
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:53,750
All of them.

690
00:50:56,286 --> 00:50:57,821
Wow.

691
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:00,457
That's cool.
You look happy.

692
00:51:01,758 --> 00:51:03,226
I was.

693
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:05,962
Who's that guy?

694
00:51:06,029 --> 00:51:08,899
In that picture,
he was Abel.

695
00:51:09,633 --> 00:51:14,638
Before then,
other names, other faces.

696
00:51:14,704 --> 00:51:16,206
But the soul...

697
00:51:16,973 --> 00:51:19,009
the soul was always him.

698
00:51:19,075 --> 00:51:22,145
So, what?
You loved each other
through multiple lives?

699
00:51:22,779 --> 00:51:25,048
These are all
the same place.

700
00:51:25,115 --> 00:51:28,485
Angkor Wat.
What we call the Beginning.

701
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:33,557
I'll find you in the Beginning.

702
00:51:33,623 --> 00:51:34,991
[Abel] I love you.

703
00:51:35,058 --> 00:51:38,595
When each of us
would find ourselves
in a new life,

704
00:51:38,662 --> 00:51:40,096
this is where
Abel and I would go.

705
00:51:40,163 --> 00:51:42,933
You're reincarnated.
How would you know
where to go?

706
00:51:43,667 --> 00:51:47,704
Most of us have a reawakening
that begins young.

707
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:50,207
Starts with small things,
memories,

708
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:52,909
feelings about a place,
dreams.

709
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:55,045
By puberty,

710
00:51:55,111 --> 00:51:57,080
most Infinites
have full recall.

711
00:51:57,147 --> 00:52:01,284
[scoffs] Right around
the time they diagnosed me
schizophrenic.

712
00:52:02,152 --> 00:52:04,855
So what happened
if you died young
and got separated?

713
00:52:04,921 --> 00:52:06,790
For an Infinite...

714
00:52:07,824 --> 00:52:09,960
death isn't the end,
it's like...

715
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:12,896
turning the page in a book.

716
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:15,932
Next chapter, same story.

717
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,235
That's crazy.

718
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:21,838
New lives, new bodies,
always meeting back
at the same place.

719
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:25,809
He was Dethroned.

720
00:52:28,211 --> 00:52:30,847
He's trapped
on a computer
somewhere.

721
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:35,318
My last life,
I got my memories back...

722
00:52:36,953 --> 00:52:38,889
and realized he was gone.

723
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:49,199
It's not my memories
that matter, Evan.

724
00:52:50,967 --> 00:52:52,135
It's yours.

725
00:52:58,875 --> 00:53:01,845
Your last life,
in Mexico...

726
00:53:02,479 --> 00:53:04,848
where did you hide the Egg?

727
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:28,371
[Bathurst]
Where's the Egg?

728
00:53:37,914 --> 00:53:40,016
Where is it?

729
00:53:49,225 --> 00:53:50,727
He's spiking.
Shut it down.

730
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:54,731
[groaning, panting]

731
00:53:54,798 --> 00:53:55,999
Hey, you're okay.
[gasps]

732
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:58,668
You're okay. Hey.
Hey, just breathe.

733
00:53:58,735 --> 00:53:59,869
I need to get up.
Breathe.

734
00:53:59,936 --> 00:54:01,338
[Garrick]
Kovic, check his vitals.

735
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:03,373
What happened in there, Evan?
What did you see?

736
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:06,176
Your neural network fired off
like the Fourth of July.

737
00:54:06,242 --> 00:54:09,813
I've been seeing this stuff
all my life. It still
doesn't make any sense.

738
00:54:09,879 --> 00:54:11,081
Why can't he
remember anything?

739
00:54:11,147 --> 00:54:12,816
Between the car accident,
the electroshock

740
00:54:12,882 --> 00:54:16,052
and the steel plate in his head,
his mind is fractured.

741
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:18,054
Something in there
won't let the memories flow.

742
00:54:18,121 --> 00:54:23,159
I can't get them out.
I'm afraid the Artisan
is our last hope.

743
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:31,968
He'll achieve recall soon.
[blows]

744
00:54:33,837 --> 00:54:35,405
If he hasn't already.

745
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:46,216
Hundreds of lifetimes,

746
00:54:46,282 --> 00:54:49,185
and it all comes down
to these few hours.

747
00:54:51,287 --> 00:54:53,456
If we don't find him...

748
00:54:55,425 --> 00:54:58,361
before he gets
his memories back...

749
00:54:59,162 --> 00:55:00,997
we lose the Egg...

750
00:55:02,365 --> 00:55:03,466
forever.

751
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:07,404
The wheels keep turning

752
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:10,340
and we can never...

753
00:55:12,108 --> 00:55:14,010
escape.

754
00:55:18,114 --> 00:55:20,183
We go at dawn.

755
00:55:53,883 --> 00:55:55,185
[shouting]

756
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:59,222
[alarm blaring]

757
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:06,362
[machine powers down]

758
00:56:12,902 --> 00:56:15,004
It's been a while, Otto.

759
00:56:15,071 --> 00:56:20,210
No one's called me
by that name in...
so many lifetimes.

760
00:56:29,185 --> 00:56:31,187
Hello, my love.

761
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:34,257
What happened to you?

762
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:38,194
You were so beautiful.

763
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:40,430
As were you.

764
00:56:40,864 --> 00:56:42,832
You don't miss it--

765
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:44,434
the agility...

766
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:46,436
the vibrancy...

767
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:49,139
being confined to this?

768
00:56:49,205 --> 00:56:52,408
You see me
as something broken.
I don't.

769
00:56:53,376 --> 00:56:56,012
You're the cripple, Otto.

770
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:58,248
Crippled by your cowardice.
Cowardice?

771
00:56:58,314 --> 00:57:03,353
No. I'm crippled
by my memory.

772
00:57:03,419 --> 00:57:07,357
You get your memories back
over years. Not me.

773
00:57:07,423 --> 00:57:11,528
I get it all back
as my brain forms.
In the womb.

774
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:17,066
Endless hours,
days, weeks, months.

775
00:57:17,133 --> 00:57:18,368
No room to move!

776
00:57:18,434 --> 00:57:21,037
Nothing
for my brain to do

777
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:23,339
but eat itself.

778
00:57:23,406 --> 00:57:27,076
All these lifetimes,
the magnitude of this gift,

779
00:57:27,143 --> 00:57:29,546
and you haven't
learned a thing.

780
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:31,281
I have to get out.

781
00:57:32,248 --> 00:57:33,917
I have to make it stop.

782
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:38,454
Don't do it.
Don't give him anything.

783
00:57:39,656 --> 00:57:41,291
Where is Treadway?

784
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:50,099
We storming the beach
at Normandy?

785
00:57:50,166 --> 00:57:52,368
You never know
with the Artisan.

786
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:54,637
Let's get ready.

787
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:31,341
[man]
Color out, please.

788
00:58:31,407 --> 00:58:33,643
[chattering, laughing]

789
00:58:35,078 --> 00:58:37,180
So, the Artisan's
a gambler?

790
00:58:37,247 --> 00:58:38,615
No, he's a hedonist.

791
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:42,151
Infinite lies,
infinite opportunity
for debauchery.

792
00:58:42,218 --> 00:58:44,187
Sounds like
my kinda guy.

793
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:59,335
[speaking Tibetan]

794
00:59:29,365 --> 00:59:32,268
[speakers:
opera music playing]

795
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:37,674
[opera continues playing]
[sighs]

796
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:40,410
Alexa, music off.
[music stops]

797
00:59:40,476 --> 00:59:43,146
Get him cleaned up
and outta here.

798
00:59:43,212 --> 00:59:45,315
You're operating
on dead guys now?

799
00:59:45,381 --> 00:59:47,684
Da Vinci used to
cut into human cadavers

800
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:51,020
so that he could
better understand
the human form.

801
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:54,357
For me, I'm all about
that brain, baby.

802
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:58,561
[laughing]
But you know that
all too well.

803
00:59:58,628 --> 01:00:03,366
Oh, what a beautiful
cranial arch you got
this time around.

804
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:07,704
I could better examine it
if I severed your head
from your neck.

805
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:10,206
Like Treadway did to me
when last we met.

806
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:12,208
Try it.
Oh.

807
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:14,410
Bathurst took the Hub.

808
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,349
Does he have the Egg?
No.

809
01:00:19,415 --> 01:00:21,651
Think we'd be here
if he did?

810
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:26,456
Wherever it is,
it's still in his head.

811
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:29,258
Treadway?

812
01:00:29,325 --> 01:00:31,594
So they say.

813
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:35,365
Wait. Is he blocked?

814
01:00:35,431 --> 01:00:37,233
[laughing]

815
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:40,103
Well, well, well,
look at this.

816
01:00:40,169 --> 01:00:41,337
Huh.

817
01:00:42,038 --> 01:00:45,608
So, your hard drive
got fragged,

818
01:00:45,675 --> 01:00:48,745
which means we're gonna
have to reset your memory.

819
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:53,816
And, Heinrich, I gotta tell ya,
I'm really gonna enjoy this.

820
01:00:54,217 --> 01:00:56,419
Ooh! [laughing]

821
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:58,154
Check this out.

822
01:00:58,554 --> 01:01:00,623
[machine powers up]

823
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:03,626
You're all familiar
with the idea
that when you die,

824
01:01:03,693 --> 01:01:06,796
your life flashes
before your eyes, right?

825
01:01:06,863 --> 01:01:10,266
This machine
enhances that experience,

826
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:12,468
prolonging
your sense of time,

827
01:01:12,535 --> 01:01:17,573
allowing you
to restore or reorder
everything inside.

828
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:24,614
This-- This right here
is the closest you're gonna get
to a total mental reboot.

829
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:25,448
[laughs]

830
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:27,283
Are you planning
on trying to drown me?

831
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:28,618
'Cause I got a thing
about drowning.

832
01:01:28,684 --> 01:01:30,787
Which is?
I don't like it!

833
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:34,123
What kind of success rate
is this guy working with,
anyway?

834
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:36,526
Confidence is... high.

835
01:01:36,592 --> 01:01:39,429
Yeah, and so are you,
obviously.

836
01:01:39,495 --> 01:01:41,197
[laughing] Okay. Hey.

837
01:01:41,264 --> 01:01:43,533
I like you this time around.
You're actually funny.

838
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:48,271
Don't take this the wrong way,
but you're usually
kind of a jerk.

839
01:01:48,337 --> 01:01:49,772
It's true.
Yeah, she gets it.

840
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:51,841
So, I'm supposed
to trust this guy?

841
01:01:51,908 --> 01:01:53,676
I wouldn't.
First,

842
01:01:53,743 --> 01:01:55,511
I resent
the gender labeling.

843
01:01:55,578 --> 01:01:58,815
Second, you can trust
that we share the same goal.

844
01:01:58,881 --> 01:02:00,049
Really? Which is?

845
01:02:00,116 --> 01:02:04,187
Bathurst wants to what,
destroy every living thing
on Earth?

846
01:02:04,253 --> 01:02:07,824
Well, that's gonna ruin
a pretty great party
I've got goin' on here.

847
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:10,126
This guy's out of his mind.
Hey--

848
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:14,230
There's a reason you
didn't bring me here before.
Mmm.

849
01:02:14,297 --> 01:02:16,766
I could die in there.
Yeah.

850
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:19,769
[Evan] Could it work?

851
01:02:21,771 --> 01:02:22,905
It could.

852
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:26,709
But you have a choice,
Evan.

853
01:02:26,776 --> 01:02:29,145
No, I don't have a choice.

854
01:02:29,779 --> 01:02:32,248
I... I can't let
anybody else get hurt

855
01:02:32,315 --> 01:02:34,150
because of what's in my head.

856
01:02:43,459 --> 01:02:45,761
All right.
Leap-of-faith time.

857
01:02:46,762 --> 01:02:49,532
Let's just do it now
before I change my mind.
All right?

858
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,235
Let's go.
Turn your machine on.

859
01:02:52,301 --> 01:02:53,736
Ooh. Ready to go for a swim?

860
01:02:53,803 --> 01:02:56,405
Yes.
This is gonna be so fun!

861
01:02:56,472 --> 01:02:58,441
Just shut up and turn it on.

862
01:02:59,575 --> 01:03:02,178
[chattering, laughing]

863
01:03:17,994 --> 01:03:20,863
[earphone: Artisan]
...prolongs your sense of time.

864
01:03:23,366 --> 01:03:26,636
Whatever happens,
don't let them stop
until it's done.

865
01:03:31,941 --> 01:03:33,609
[exhales]

866
01:03:56,999 --> 01:03:59,235
[machine beeping]

867
01:04:08,544 --> 01:04:11,781
[Artisan] He'll hold his breath
as long as he can, and then...

868
01:04:11,847 --> 01:04:14,016
base instinct
takes over.

869
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:32,001
Twenty-two.
Too many.

870
01:04:34,604 --> 01:04:36,872
[croupier]
Twenty. No more.
And 18.

871
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:54,957
[alarm blaring]

872
01:04:55,024 --> 01:04:56,726
Oh, my God.
He's drowning.

873
01:04:57,126 --> 01:04:58,894
That's the whole idea.

874
01:05:02,632 --> 01:05:06,402
Maybe we should pull him out.
He's not there yet.
Two more minutes.

875
01:05:13,442 --> 01:05:15,578
Abel, listen to me.
If I fail...

876
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:21,517
Come on.

877
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:24,553
Nora...
He's dying.

878
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:26,656
We're close.
We are close.

879
01:05:26,722 --> 01:05:28,591
[beeping]

880
01:05:28,658 --> 01:05:30,593
[sustained tone]

881
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:33,462
Doesn't have a pulse!
[tone continues]

882
01:05:34,964 --> 01:05:35,965
Get him out!

883
01:05:42,104 --> 01:05:43,105
Come on!
Come on.

884
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:45,641
[grunts]

885
01:05:53,849 --> 01:05:56,018
Okay. Okay.
[grunts]

886
01:05:56,952 --> 01:05:58,754
[grunts]
Get out of the way.

887
01:06:03,025 --> 01:06:04,794
No!

888
01:06:16,672 --> 01:06:17,973
He's gone.

889
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:21,077
[sobbing]

890
01:06:21,143 --> 01:06:23,112
We killed him.

891
01:06:23,179 --> 01:06:25,648
[Nora continues sobbing]

892
01:06:35,691 --> 01:06:37,660
[sobbing]

893
01:06:43,699 --> 01:06:46,602
[yells, groaning]

894
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:49,905
[Treadway]
If I fail, look inside.

895
01:07:10,092 --> 01:07:14,130
[gasping]

896
01:07:14,196 --> 01:07:17,066
[coughing]
Evan, you're okay.
Just breathe.

897
01:07:25,241 --> 01:07:28,511
[coughing, panting]

898
01:07:32,681 --> 01:07:35,718
I am Treadway.
I am Treadway.

899
01:07:45,594 --> 01:07:46,962
[gasps]
Hey. Whoa, whoa.

900
01:07:49,932 --> 01:07:51,233
I'm Treadway.

901
01:07:54,804 --> 01:07:58,207
[Kovic] If you are Treadway,
answer this:

902
01:07:59,108 --> 01:08:01,243
Do you know
where the Egg is?

903
01:08:21,730 --> 01:08:22,965
Yes.

904
01:08:23,332 --> 01:08:24,767
Yes?
Yes.

905
01:08:25,434 --> 01:08:28,137
Look inside. Look inside.

906
01:08:30,739 --> 01:08:33,175
We were trained
to think of bodies
as unimportant, right?

907
01:08:33,242 --> 01:08:35,744
Right.
Just shells
meant to be discarded.

908
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:38,747
Well, Treadway knew
the one place

909
01:08:38,814 --> 01:08:40,516
that nobody would look.

910
01:08:47,089 --> 01:08:48,123
[yells]

911
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:58,267
Abel? Abel, listen to me.

912
01:08:58,334 --> 01:09:00,636
If I fail, look inside.

913
01:09:01,036 --> 01:09:02,805
It's in his body.

914
01:09:03,305 --> 01:09:04,540
Back at the Hub.

915
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:10,179
It's been there
the whole time.
Come on.

916
01:09:12,147 --> 01:09:14,183
I am shocked that that worked.

917
01:09:20,189 --> 01:09:23,225
I knew it was you
the whole time.
That's why I let you win.

918
01:09:23,292 --> 01:09:24,260
Oh, you let me, huh?

919
01:09:24,326 --> 01:09:25,961
Whoo! I don't know
about you guys,

920
01:09:26,028 --> 01:09:27,930
but I could use a drink.

921
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:29,265
Come on,
we don't have time for--

922
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:31,000
[gunshot]
[groaning]

923
01:09:31,066 --> 01:09:33,135
[Artisan]
Security lockdown!

924
01:09:34,336 --> 01:09:36,338
[rifle cocks]

925
01:09:36,405 --> 01:09:37,673
I'm hit.

926
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:39,208
You all right?

927
01:09:44,413 --> 01:09:45,648
[Artisan] Hey!

928
01:09:45,714 --> 01:09:47,149
Follow me.

929
01:09:47,216 --> 01:09:49,318
Come on. We gotta go.
[grunts]

930
01:09:49,385 --> 01:09:51,654
Open emergency lift.

931
01:09:54,857 --> 01:09:56,125
We gotta go. We gotta go.
Wait!

932
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:57,860
Are you crazy?
They're about to breach!

933
01:09:57,927 --> 01:10:00,796
We're not running,
all right?
I'm tired of running.

934
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:03,699
I'm gonna fight 'em right now.
[Nora] Hang in there, Trace.

935
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:10,339
She's dead.

936
01:10:10,406 --> 01:10:11,807
Oh, sh...

937
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:14,877
[Artisan]
Guys, we need to leave now.

938
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:23,953
I'm staying.
What?

939
01:10:24,019 --> 01:10:26,055
We stay here,
we fight 'em now.

940
01:10:30,292 --> 01:10:33,128
You're leaking
like the Titanic.
I'm fine.

941
01:10:33,195 --> 01:10:36,131
If you die here,
who stops Bathurst?

942
01:10:36,865 --> 01:10:38,067
He's right.

943
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:39,969
Hey.

944
01:10:40,035 --> 01:10:43,939
You make this worth it,
dziecko.

945
01:10:44,773 --> 01:10:46,742
Then buy me some time.

946
01:10:47,376 --> 01:10:49,078
[Artisan]
Open weapons room door.

947
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:52,915
Good luck.

948
01:11:01,323 --> 01:11:03,926
[beeping]

949
01:11:44,833 --> 01:11:47,336
[groaning, shouting]

950
01:12:06,055 --> 01:12:07,222
Careful, sir.

951
01:12:08,857 --> 01:12:10,192
Oh, I will be.

952
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:24,239
[grunts]

953
01:12:36,318 --> 01:12:37,352

[yells]

955
01:13:16,258 --> 01:13:19,061
We're taking
Treadway's body
to Scotland.

956
01:13:19,128 --> 01:13:20,295
Very well.

957
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:23,832
[Nora] Keep him alive.

958
01:13:23,899 --> 01:13:27,302
[Artisan]
I'll do the best I can,
but he's lost a lot of blood.

959
01:13:28,203 --> 01:13:30,272
The keys are in the car.

960
01:13:38,213 --> 01:13:40,582
[engine starts]

961
01:13:46,555 --> 01:13:48,223
[zipper unzipping]

962
01:13:53,662 --> 01:13:55,264
Heinrich.

963
01:13:55,330 --> 01:13:57,566
Good of you to join us.

964
01:14:00,402 --> 01:14:03,405
I only wish
you were here
to see this...

965
01:14:04,673 --> 01:14:06,442
to understand your...

966
01:14:08,076 --> 01:14:10,312
your role in this.

967
01:14:16,451 --> 01:14:18,620
The end of all our debates.

968
01:14:40,976 --> 01:14:42,444
[sighs]

969
01:14:46,181 --> 01:14:48,650
The end of all things.

970
01:14:52,988 --> 01:14:55,257
Have it cleaned and tested.

971
01:14:55,324 --> 01:14:57,526
Make sure
it's the real thing.

972
01:14:57,960 --> 01:14:59,995
Is it really over?

973
01:15:00,062 --> 01:15:01,964
Not quite yet.

974
01:15:02,030 --> 01:15:04,533
Never underestimate
Treadway.

975
01:15:05,033 --> 01:15:08,570
[electric guitar playing]

976

[playing stops]

979
01:15:31,693 --> 01:15:34,263
Ah. You're awake.

980
01:15:34,329 --> 01:15:36,131
Where am I?

981
01:15:36,198 --> 01:15:39,635
I told Nora
I'd wait with you
until you woke up.

982
01:15:39,701 --> 01:15:42,971
[grunts]
You're in my safe house.

983
01:15:43,038 --> 01:15:47,175
What are you doing?
I'm doing your morphine!

984
01:15:47,242 --> 01:15:48,477
Where is she?

985
01:15:48,543 --> 01:15:50,612
Huh?
Oh, she went after Bathurst.

986
01:15:51,713 --> 01:15:53,148
Oh, shit.

987
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:56,218
She's not doing this alone.
No way.

988
01:15:56,952 --> 01:16:00,022
[grunts]
Whoa, whoa!
Come on, man.

989
01:16:00,088 --> 01:16:03,659
You try running out now,
you'll bleed out
before you reach the compound.

990
01:16:03,725 --> 01:16:07,396
If we're going down,
we're going down together.
[panting]

991
01:16:07,462 --> 01:16:09,364
Hey, hey. Hey, hey.

992
01:16:09,431 --> 01:16:12,401
I just patched you up, man.

993
01:16:12,467 --> 01:16:15,370
Let me catch you up
on the current situation.

994
01:16:15,437 --> 01:16:17,539
If Bathurst gets his way,
we're all done.

995
01:16:17,606 --> 01:16:19,641
There's no more
second chances.

996
01:16:19,708 --> 01:16:22,244
I'm gonna get the Egg
and kill him.

997
01:16:22,878 --> 01:16:24,680
She told me you were one of us.

998
01:16:24,746 --> 01:16:27,316
Obviously,
you're just full of shit.

999
01:16:28,717 --> 01:16:32,254
Diagnostics are done.
The bomb is ready for the Egg.

1000
01:16:32,321 --> 01:16:34,323
Have them load it
on the plane.

1001
01:16:42,497 --> 01:16:45,067
Come here, you bastard.

1002
01:16:45,133 --> 01:16:47,336
Do you think He'll...

1003
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:50,505
let us do this?

1004
01:16:52,307 --> 01:16:53,508
No?

1005
01:16:59,481 --> 01:17:01,516
The end of all things.

1006
01:17:08,423 --> 01:17:10,192
Go.

Move, move, move!
On the rig! Let's go!

1009
01:19:10,278 --> 01:19:11,613
Move, move!

Do you need a ride?
Love one.

1013
01:20:59,688 --> 01:21:02,357
You okay?
No. Don't ask.

1014
01:21:13,101 --> 01:21:16,771
[laughs]
Did you see that?

1015
01:22:18,767 --> 01:22:20,669
Nora, you okay?

1016
01:22:20,735 --> 01:22:22,904
Okay, come on.

1017
01:22:22,971 --> 01:22:23,972
I got you.

1018

[Nora grunting]

1019
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:30,912
I'll get you out of here.
Come on.

[groans]

1021
01:22:36,751 --> 01:22:38,053
You all right?

1022
01:22:38,119 --> 01:22:39,421
Oh, shit.

1023
01:22:39,487 --> 01:22:41,623
Hey. We gotta get you
out of here.

1024
01:22:49,130 --> 01:22:52,067
You gonna be okay to move?
Yeah, I'll be fine.

1025
01:22:52,133 --> 01:22:53,368
Okay. Come on.

1026

[plane engine accelerating]

1028
01:23:32,974 --> 01:23:35,443
You gotta go.
Bathurst is getting away.

1029
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:38,847
His hard drives are here.
I have to destroy them
and free them all.

1030
01:23:39,814 --> 01:23:41,182
I'll see you again.

1031
01:23:47,689 --> 01:23:49,190

We'll be landing in Glasgow
in 16 minutes, sir.

1040
01:25:28,156 --> 01:25:29,290
Stay low.

1041
01:25:31,259 --> 01:25:32,794

01:25:40,268 --> 01:25:42,804
Come on. Come on.

1045
01:25:48,343 --> 01:25:50,645
They're all here.

1046
01:25:50,712 --> 01:25:52,046
All the souls.

1047
01:25:52,947 --> 01:25:55,316
We have to free them all.

1048
01:25:55,383 --> 01:25:57,752
Whoa! [grunts]

1049
01:25:57,819 --> 01:25:59,721
Nora. Nora, hey. Hey.

1050
01:25:59,787 --> 01:26:02,957
Stay with me, okay?
We are so close.

1051
01:26:03,491 --> 01:26:05,960
Let's blow some shit up,
huh?

1052
01:26:27,715 --> 01:26:29,617
Shit!
[alarms blaring]

1053
01:26:29,684 --> 01:26:31,085
We've lost engine three, sir.

1054
01:26:38,893 --> 01:26:40,995
We're gonna have to
land the aircraft.

1055
01:26:48,369 --> 01:26:51,005
What the hell
are you doing? Sir!

1056
01:26:51,773 --> 01:26:54,008
[screams]

1057
01:26:58,246 --> 01:27:01,049
Please! You're gonna
crash the aircraft. Sir!

1058
01:27:03,885 --> 01:27:05,687
[groans]

1059
01:28:07,115 --> 01:28:09,283
It's impossible.

1060
01:28:10,485 --> 01:28:12,353
I-Impossible.

1061
01:28:22,930 --> 01:28:24,065
[beeping]

1062
01:28:24,132 --> 01:28:25,466
He's opened
the bloody top hatch, sir.

1063
01:28:36,044 --> 01:28:38,112
[thud]

1064
01:29:17,518 --> 01:29:19,220
You disappoint me.

1065
01:29:21,155 --> 01:29:23,357
No recognition
whatsoever, huh?

1066
01:29:23,925 --> 01:29:25,493
I think I should feel hurt.

1067
01:29:27,261 --> 01:29:30,531
Car crash?
Steel plate, remember?

1068
01:29:49,550 --> 01:29:51,919

[yells]

1073
01:31:48,536 --> 01:31:51,973
Treadway,
you can't deactivate it!

1074
01:31:53,007 --> 01:31:54,642
It's happening!

1075
01:32:12,026 --> 01:32:13,561
[grunts]

1076
01:32:20,701 --> 01:32:22,570

1078
01:32:36,584 --> 01:32:38,452
No!

[beeps]

1080
01:33:12,086 --> 01:33:14,555
[Evan] Death isn't the end.
Not for us.

1081
01:33:14,622 --> 01:33:17,091
Maybe not for any of us.

1082
01:33:17,158 --> 01:33:19,493
New chapter, same story.

1083
01:33:21,262 --> 01:33:22,663
I can carry you out.

1084
01:33:23,264 --> 01:33:24,365
No way.

1085
01:33:24,432 --> 01:33:26,500
I'll free them.

1086
01:33:27,735 --> 01:33:28,703
Here.

1087
01:33:28,769 --> 01:33:32,106
[panting]

1088
01:33:32,173 --> 01:33:34,141
I'll see you around.
Yeah.

1089
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:49,390
[Leona]
I'll find you in the Beginning.

1090
01:33:49,457 --> 01:33:50,758
[Abel] I love you.

1091
01:34:09,310 --> 01:34:10,711
[Evan] I ask myself...

1092
01:34:11,379 --> 01:34:14,515
what did being Evan McCauley
teach me?

1093
01:34:17,685 --> 01:34:20,287
[crying]

1094
01:34:20,354 --> 01:34:23,758
[Evan] If each new life
is a chance to build
on what was,

1095
01:34:23,824 --> 01:34:27,128
a chance to press forward
to the best of what could be...

1096
01:34:28,863 --> 01:34:30,765
Go, go, go!

1097
01:34:30,831 --> 01:34:34,101
...why will some of us
have to pick up the sword
and fight again...

1098

[man speaking Arabic]

[crying]

1100
01:34:46,914 --> 01:34:49,717
...while others discover
a new beginning?

1101
01:35:03,197 --> 01:35:04,598
Nora?

1102
01:35:12,706 --> 01:35:15,643
[Evan] It's hope.
That's what I learned.

1103
01:35:15,709 --> 01:35:19,146
Yes, we fall.
Yes, we fail.

1104
01:35:19,213 --> 01:35:21,816
Yes, sometimes we screw up
everything we touch.

1105
01:35:21,882 --> 01:35:24,618
But each moment we live
is connected by a belief

1106
01:35:24,685 --> 01:35:30,157
that the actions we take will
next day, next week, next life

1107
01:35:30,224 --> 01:35:31,792
add up to something more,

1108
01:35:31,859 --> 01:35:34,528
something bigger
than yourself.

1109
01:35:50,644 --> 01:35:54,582
And next... well,
the possibilities are...

1110
01:35:55,416 --> 01:35:56,817
infinite.

1111

1114

So...

1115
01:37:09,723 --> 01:37:14,261
when your son
starts asking questions
about his past,

1116
01:37:14,328 --> 01:37:15,496
give me a call.

1118

He says he's just a child.
[Artisan] Ehh...

1119
01:37:26,674 --> 01:37:28,342
What about your sword?

1120
01:37:28,409 --> 01:37:29,677
[Artisan laughs]

1121
01:37:29,743 --> 01:37:31,745
Oh that's not my sword. It's
his.

1122
01:37:37,685 --> 01:37:40,521
Artisan,
what took you so long?

1123
01:37:41,355 --> 01:37:42,690
See you soon, Treadway.
