1
00:00:05,033 --> 00:00:06,400
Hey.

2
00:00:06,434 --> 00:00:08,934
Hey, Andy, will you
look at my back?

3
00:00:08,968 --> 00:00:11,501
Actually, Byron, the phrase
is "watch your back"

4
00:00:11,534 --> 00:00:13,300
and yes, no matter
what happens...

5
00:00:13,334 --> 00:00:16,634
No. I mean actually
look at my back.

6
00:00:16,667 --> 00:00:18,501
See, I took a nap this weekend

7
00:00:18,534 --> 00:00:20,968
with the shades open
and the sun focused

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,767
through my ant colony
like a magnifying glass

9
00:00:23,801 --> 00:00:26,000
and burned a hole
through my shirt.

10
00:00:26,033 --> 00:00:27,000
Wow, that is weird.

11
00:00:27,033 --> 00:00:29,200
Although it is kind
of funny, you know...

12
00:00:29,234 --> 00:00:31,734
Ants burning a person
with a magnifying glass.

13
00:00:31,767 --> 00:00:35,033
Yeah, well, I got back
at them pretty good,

14
00:00:35,067 --> 00:00:36,767
but the worst part is

15
00:00:36,801 --> 00:00:38,367
I have to change the dressing

16
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,400
every three hours.

17
00:00:39,434 --> 00:00:40,434
Would you help me?

18
00:00:40,467 --> 00:00:41,467
I can't reach.

19
00:00:41,501 --> 00:00:42,667
Sure.

20
00:00:42,701 --> 00:00:44,601
This is what it's all about.

21
00:00:44,634 --> 00:00:46,534
Helping your friend
in a time of...

22
00:00:46,567 --> 00:00:50,601
Oh, my God! It's hideous!

23
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:52,501
How's it look?

24
00:00:52,534 --> 00:00:54,000
Fine.

25
00:00:55,067 --> 00:00:56,367
Hey, Jessica.

26
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,567
Here's the thing from the place.

27
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,701
My ant colony set
my back on fire.

28
00:01:01,734 --> 00:01:03,667
No, I'm fine.

29
00:01:03,701 --> 00:01:05,267
Is something wrong?

30
00:01:06,334 --> 00:01:08,534
Okay, Tommy and I broke up.

31
00:01:08,567 --> 00:01:09,434
Who's Tommy?

32
00:01:09,467 --> 00:01:11,701
That cute doctor I met
a couple of weeks ago.

33
00:01:11,734 --> 00:01:14,367
He said it bothered him
that I didn't like his cat.

34
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,100
I thought you...

35
00:01:15,133 --> 00:01:16,434
Let me finish.

36
00:01:16,467 --> 00:01:19,601
His cat, which he
kept in his freezer

37
00:01:19,634 --> 00:01:23,267
and apologized to every
time we made love.

38
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,400
Jessica hasn't always
had the best luck

39
00:01:25,434 --> 00:01:26,567
when it comes to men.

40
00:01:26,601 --> 00:01:28,634
Hey, honey, I'm ready to go.

41
00:01:29,734 --> 00:01:31,400
Jessica, I'm in a meeting.

42
00:01:31,434 --> 00:01:33,000
But you're...

43
00:01:33,033 --> 00:01:34,934
Sweetie, this isn't
going to work

44
00:01:34,968 --> 00:01:36,667
if we don't trust each other.

45
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:42,033
Alex, I really respect

46
00:01:42,067 --> 00:01:43,634
that you want to wait,

47
00:01:43,667 --> 00:01:45,968
but we've been going
out for two months.

48
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,200
I'm sorry, honey.

49
00:01:47,234 --> 00:01:49,034
I'm just feeling a little
fat right now, okay?

50
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:52,200
You know, maybe I don't need
to be in a relationship.

51
00:01:52,234 --> 00:01:53,834
Lots of things

52
00:01:53,868 --> 00:01:55,067
don't have relationships.

53
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:59,400
Trees, shrimp,
ketchup, wallpaper.

54
00:02:00,601 --> 00:02:02,601
What is this list I'm making?

55
00:02:02,634 --> 00:02:03,834
Poor Jessica.

56
00:02:03,868 --> 00:02:05,734
I really wanted to help.

57
00:02:05,767 --> 00:02:07,667
Luckily, later that day,

58
00:02:07,701 --> 00:02:10,300
I found the perfect man for her.

59
00:02:29,467 --> 00:02:31,400
Ah, I don't want
to meet anybody.

60
00:02:31,434 --> 00:02:34,100
Maybe I should just take
a break for a while.

61
00:02:34,133 --> 00:02:36,200
Come on, this guy has
a lot going for him

62
00:02:36,234 --> 00:02:38,767
particularly the fact that
you didn't choose him.

63
00:02:38,801 --> 00:02:41,067
Well... that does sound good.

64
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,234
Is he cute?

65
00:02:42,267 --> 00:02:43,534
Is he cute?

66
00:02:43,567 --> 00:02:45,434
He's one of the cutest
guys I've ever seen.

67
00:02:45,467 --> 00:02:47,534
He's tall and he's rugged.

68
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:48,701
Oh, and his butt.

69
00:02:48,734 --> 00:02:50,734
Imagine the finest ass
you've ever seen.

70
00:02:50,767 --> 00:02:51,934
Now double it.

71
00:02:51,968 --> 00:02:53,133
What are you doing?

72
00:02:53,167 --> 00:02:55,367
I don't know. This
is all very new.

73
00:02:58,767 --> 00:03:00,834
♪ You never know just
what's around the bend ♪

74
00:03:00,868 --> 00:03:02,567
♪ Where to go and
where you've been ♪

75
00:03:02,601 --> 00:03:05,367
♪ Just see the world
through my eyes ♪

76
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,567
♪ And I think you'd
be surprised. ♪

77
00:03:14,067 --> 00:03:16,801
So the burn on my back
started to fester,

78
00:03:16,834 --> 00:03:18,534
but getting a private
nurse for the night

79
00:03:18,567 --> 00:03:21,200
was way too expensive,
so I hired a prostitute

80
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:23,601
to change the dressing
every three hours.

81
00:03:23,634 --> 00:03:26,000
She did it once and left.

82
00:03:26,033 --> 00:03:28,367
She said it was the ninth
most disgusting thing

83
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,834
she had ever been asked to do.

84
00:03:30,868 --> 00:03:32,434
And how was your weekend?

85
00:03:33,501 --> 00:03:35,601
We played tennis.

86
00:03:35,634 --> 00:03:37,200
Oh.

87
00:03:37,234 --> 00:03:40,501
Morning. What's that smell?

88
00:03:40,534 --> 00:03:42,968
Does it smell like a
crab died in yogurt?

89
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,901
Because that might be my back.

90
00:03:44,934 --> 00:03:46,334
Nevermind.

91
00:03:48,934 --> 00:03:50,067
Ow.

92
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,501
What are you saying "ow" for?

93
00:03:51,534 --> 00:03:52,501
I kissed you.

94
00:03:52,534 --> 00:03:53,501
Hard.

95
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:54,634
You okay, man?

96
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:56,501
Well, I was just
trying to thank you

97
00:03:56,534 --> 00:03:57,934
for setting me up with Ben.

98
00:03:57,968 --> 00:03:59,868
He is fantastic.

99
00:03:59,901 --> 00:04:01,367
So, is he cute?

100
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,167
Is he cute? He's one
of the cutest guys...

101
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,701
Dude.

102
00:04:04,734 --> 00:04:06,834
The only strange thing is...

103
00:04:06,868 --> 00:04:10,167
sometimes he's
fascinating and witty,

104
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,868
and other times it's like

105
00:04:11,901 --> 00:04:15,634
trying to make conversation
with a really stupid hammer.

106
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:17,501
It's the same with sex.

107
00:04:17,534 --> 00:04:20,000
Sometimes he's... spectacular,

108
00:04:20,033 --> 00:04:21,334
and then

109
00:04:21,367 --> 00:04:22,767
other times, it's like

110
00:04:22,801 --> 00:04:25,367
he just kind of forgets
how things work.

111
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,267
That's not so strange.

112
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,033
Once, I forgot how to use pants.

113
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,267
Of course, I might
have been depressed.

114
00:04:34,434 --> 00:04:36,834
Show me!

115
00:04:36,868 --> 00:04:39,667
Show me!

116
00:04:41,667 --> 00:04:44,534
What kind of monster are you?!

117
00:04:44,567 --> 00:04:47,067
Anyway, Ben is great,

118
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,534
and I owe it all to Andy.

119
00:04:53,267 --> 00:04:56,934
You know, I wasn't going to say
anything in front of Jessica,

120
00:04:56,968 --> 00:04:58,434
but I don't like that Ben.

121
00:04:58,467 --> 00:05:00,234
He and his twin brother

122
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:01,577
are always hanging
out at the bar,

123
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:02,868
trying to get me to join them

124
00:05:02,901 --> 00:05:05,000
in making fun of
the less handsome.

125
00:05:05,033 --> 00:05:06,968
I won't play.

126
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:11,200
Wait, Ben has a twin?

127
00:05:11,234 --> 00:05:12,701
Are they identical?

128
00:05:12,734 --> 00:05:14,534
To each other? Absolutely.

129
00:05:14,567 --> 00:05:16,200
To other sets of twins?

130
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:17,434
Doubt it.

131
00:05:17,467 --> 00:05:20,000
No. Didn't you hear
what Jessica said?

132
00:05:20,033 --> 00:05:23,434
About how sometimes Ben
seems like he's one person

133
00:05:23,467 --> 00:05:26,334
and then sometimes he seems
like he's another person.

134
00:05:27,434 --> 00:05:32,400
I think Ben and his twin
are sharing Jessica.

135
00:05:32,434 --> 00:05:35,734
Hey, Andy, how's that going crazy
thing working out for you?

136
00:05:35,767 --> 00:05:36,734
Yeah, you do sound

137
00:05:36,767 --> 00:05:37,901
a little paranoid.

138
00:05:37,934 --> 00:05:39,400
Sounds like the time you thought

139
00:05:39,434 --> 00:05:40,968
you figured out
the true identity

140
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
of the sandwich guy.

141
00:05:51,567 --> 00:05:55,434
Hitler!

142
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
That was so embarrassing.

143
00:06:01,033 --> 00:06:02,467
What? You think
when Hitler comes,

144
00:06:02,501 --> 00:06:05,300
he's just going to
goose-step in in uniform?

145
00:06:05,334 --> 00:06:07,801
I'm sorry. "When" Hitler comes?

146
00:06:15,367 --> 00:06:18,234
Byron hired a prostitute
to clean his wound.

147
00:06:18,267 --> 00:06:19,567
"Clean his wound"?

148
00:06:19,601 --> 00:06:22,868
That is the worst euphemism
for sex I've ever heard.

149
00:06:22,901 --> 00:06:26,367
No, she literally cleans
the wound on his back.

150
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,734
Oh...

151
00:06:27,767 --> 00:06:30,033
Then why'd you say it
all sexy like that?

152
00:06:30,067 --> 00:06:32,200
You think everything
I say is sexy.

153
00:06:32,234 --> 00:06:33,701
Here, try this.

154
00:06:33,734 --> 00:06:36,734
Byron has a big, pussy
burn on his back,

155
00:06:36,767 --> 00:06:37,944
and I'm going to ask him to stay

156
00:06:37,968 --> 00:06:39,334
at my place for a while

157
00:06:39,367 --> 00:06:41,801
so that I can change
his rancid bandages.

158
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:43,868
You still sound hot.

159
00:06:43,901 --> 00:06:45,176
Listen, why don't
I stay with you

160
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,567
for a while and we can take care

161
00:06:46,601 --> 00:06:47,801
of the little guy together?

162
00:06:47,834 --> 00:06:49,067
Really? You'd do that?

163
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,100
We took care of your
neighbor's cactus for a week.

164
00:06:51,133 --> 00:06:53,534
That wasn't anywhere near as
hard as I thought it would be.

165
00:06:53,567 --> 00:06:55,167
Yeah, but we did kill it.

166
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,400
Remember, you gave
it that milkshake?

167
00:06:57,434 --> 00:06:59,767
Oh, yeah, but Byron
likes milkshakes.

168
00:07:03,701 --> 00:07:06,734
Got everything you need, cowboy?

169
00:07:06,767 --> 00:07:09,367
Oh... My grandfather used
to call me "cowboy,"

170
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,567
but he was crazy.

171
00:07:11,601 --> 00:07:15,567
The year before he died,
he just called me, "Gaah."

172
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,067
"Gaah"?

173
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,567
Yes, Bumpa?

174
00:07:18,601 --> 00:07:22,000
Okay, so your painkillers
are starting to kick in.

175
00:07:27,033 --> 00:07:29,434
Wendy!

176
00:07:32,734 --> 00:07:33,901
Keith!

177
00:07:33,934 --> 00:07:35,100
Keith, it's 2:00.

178
00:07:35,133 --> 00:07:38,033
It's your turn to
change Byron's bandage.

179
00:07:38,067 --> 00:07:40,033
I need changing.

180
00:07:40,067 --> 00:07:41,267
Keith.

181
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,534
And some juice.

182
00:07:57,534 --> 00:07:58,534
Wendy.

183
00:07:58,567 --> 00:07:59,567
Hmm?

184
00:07:59,601 --> 00:08:01,100
What is he doing here?

185
00:08:01,133 --> 00:08:03,267
He said he had a bad dream.

186
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,000
Can't he go back to his own bed?

187
00:08:05,033 --> 00:08:06,367
You can try.

188
00:08:10,767 --> 00:08:12,567
No!

189
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:23,033
The next day, I was still
worried about Jessica.

190
00:08:23,067 --> 00:08:24,601
I was sure she was being dated

191
00:08:24,634 --> 00:08:26,901
by two separate but
identical men,

192
00:08:26,934 --> 00:08:28,467
but how can I prove it?

193
00:08:28,501 --> 00:08:30,801
My plan was simple.

194
00:08:30,834 --> 00:08:34,300
I would inject Ben with
a radioactive isotope.

195
00:08:49,501 --> 00:08:53,033
The next time this "Ben"
came to pick up Jessica,

196
00:08:53,067 --> 00:08:56,734
I would surreptitiously
take a small blood sample.

197
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:05,868
Unfortunately, there was a lot

198
00:09:05,901 --> 00:09:07,968
of running and
stabbing in this plan,

199
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,834
so I came up with another idea.

200
00:09:09,868 --> 00:09:11,567
When Ben came to
pick up Jessica,

201
00:09:11,601 --> 00:09:14,334
I made a point of mentioning
my grandmother's age.

202
00:09:14,367 --> 00:09:17,601
Then, the next time Ben took
Jessica out, I would see

203
00:09:17,634 --> 00:09:20,334
if he remembered how old
Granny Richter was.

204
00:09:20,367 --> 00:09:21,534
Hey, Ben.

205
00:09:21,567 --> 00:09:24,767
Or, as my 84-year-old
grandmother would say,

206
00:09:24,801 --> 00:09:26,234
"Hey, Ben, I'm 84."

207
00:09:26,267 --> 00:09:27,367
Hey, Andy.

208
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,534
Did I say my grandmother was 84?

209
00:09:29,567 --> 00:09:31,734
Because I meant 84.

210
00:09:33,067 --> 00:09:34,367
Hey, Ben. I'm ready to go.

211
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,234
84? Ben and I were just laughing

212
00:09:36,267 --> 00:09:38,801
about how old my 84-year-old
grandmother is.

213
00:09:38,834 --> 00:09:40,000
She can't even walk

214
00:09:40,033 --> 00:09:42,067
'cause she's 84.

215
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:46,234
The trap had been laid.

216
00:09:46,267 --> 00:09:49,467
The next night I arranged
to run into Jessica

217
00:09:49,501 --> 00:09:52,968
and her precious boy-toy
so I could bring my plan

218
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,734
to its wickedly
delicious conclusion.

219
00:09:55,767 --> 00:09:57,667
Now I just sound gay.

220
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,834
Hey, Keith.

221
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:04,300
Yeah, yeah, I know.

222
00:10:04,334 --> 00:10:06,601
I should be at Wendy's helping
to take care of Byron.

223
00:10:06,634 --> 00:10:09,434
Listen, have Jessica and
that so-called "Ben"

224
00:10:09,467 --> 00:10:10,501
showed up yet?

225
00:10:10,534 --> 00:10:11,634
I don't know.

226
00:10:11,667 --> 00:10:13,367
Why don't I check the
bottom of this glass?

227
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,667
No, not there.

228
00:10:16,701 --> 00:10:17,667
Pst.

229
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:18,801
Jessica's coming.

230
00:10:18,834 --> 00:10:20,234
Act like we're talking.

231
00:10:20,267 --> 00:10:21,734
Actually, we are. Hurry!

232
00:10:21,767 --> 00:10:23,901
♪ La, la, la, la, la, la, la ♪

233
00:10:23,934 --> 00:10:25,334
♪ La, la, la...

234
00:10:25,367 --> 00:10:28,234
Sardines... they're lucky
to even be a fish.

235
00:10:28,267 --> 00:10:29,834
Oh, hey, Jessica, Ben.

236
00:10:29,868 --> 00:10:30,868
Hi, you guys.

237
00:10:30,901 --> 00:10:32,200
I'll get us some drinks.

238
00:10:32,234 --> 00:10:33,200
Okay.

239
00:10:33,234 --> 00:10:34,267
So, how's it going?

240
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,501
Great. Fine.

241
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:37,734
And now I will expose
this alleged Ben

242
00:10:37,767 --> 00:10:40,133
by showing that he
doesn't know the age

243
00:10:40,167 --> 00:10:41,701
of a certain grandmother.

244
00:10:41,734 --> 00:10:42,901
So, Ben, uh,

245
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:44,334
you remember the other day

246
00:10:44,367 --> 00:10:47,367
when you and I were talking
about my 84-year-old grand...

247
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,734
Damn it!

248
00:10:48,767 --> 00:10:51,400
So much for my dream of
ever becoming a spy.

249
00:10:57,968 --> 00:10:59,334
Go on. Get your drinks.

250
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,400
I'm done with you.

251
00:11:03,701 --> 00:11:05,434
Oh, I almost got those guys.

252
00:11:05,467 --> 00:11:08,734
Yeah, Chicago, please connect
me to Ben Hoffensteader.

253
00:11:08,767 --> 00:11:11,601
You really need to know
Jessica's okay, huh?

254
00:11:11,634 --> 00:11:14,100
Well, of course. It's Jessica.

255
00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:15,767
And I just know
they're doing this.

256
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:17,067
It's so obvious.

257
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,033
Hello.

258
00:11:19,067 --> 00:11:20,434
Ben Hoffensteader?

259
00:11:20,467 --> 00:11:21,467
Yes.

260
00:11:22,834 --> 00:11:24,167
Yeah, the twins are
switching off.

261
00:11:34,667 --> 00:11:36,868
So I said, "You take
her, you brought her."

262
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Oh!

263
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:42,300
What is going on?!

264
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:44,267
I have something
awful to tell you.

265
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,300
Something so awful you
won't want to believe it.

266
00:11:47,334 --> 00:11:50,701
Oh, Andy, Hitler would be 113.

267
00:11:50,734 --> 00:11:53,567
Ben has a twin, and
the two of them

268
00:11:53,601 --> 00:11:56,734
have been sharing
you like a bike.

269
00:11:56,767 --> 00:11:59,334
Yeah, I know. They're
switching off.

270
00:11:59,367 --> 00:12:01,501
Maybe I left something out.

271
00:12:01,534 --> 00:12:05,834
Sometimes two babies
come out of a lady...

272
00:12:05,868 --> 00:12:06,834
Andy, I know.

273
00:12:06,868 --> 00:12:08,400
Last week I became suspicious,

274
00:12:08,434 --> 00:12:10,200
so I bit one of
them on the thigh.

275
00:12:10,234 --> 00:12:12,400
The next night when the
bite wasn't there,

276
00:12:12,434 --> 00:12:14,000
I knew they'd pulled a switch.

277
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:15,367
It was so simple.

278
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,133
I had toyed with a
thigh-biting plan briefly,

279
00:12:18,167 --> 00:12:20,000
but I could never crack it.

280
00:12:20,033 --> 00:12:22,167
Together, they are
the perfect guy.

281
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,167
Ben is one of the most smartest,

282
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,067
most interesting people
I have ever talked to,

283
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,534
but he's lousy in bed.

284
00:12:28,567 --> 00:12:29,901
His brother Peter,

285
00:12:29,934 --> 00:12:32,067
a complete maroon, but in bed,

286
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,801
he's like a laser-guided
smart bomb.

287
00:12:34,834 --> 00:12:36,767
Right down the ventilator shaft

288
00:12:36,801 --> 00:12:38,167
and kaboom!

289
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,567
There's a ventilator shaft?

290
00:12:40,601 --> 00:12:41,701
When we meet for a date,

291
00:12:41,734 --> 00:12:42,934
if the smart one shows up,

292
00:12:42,968 --> 00:12:45,200
we have a fascinating
conversation over dinner

293
00:12:45,234 --> 00:12:46,577
and then I tell him
I have a headache

294
00:12:46,601 --> 00:12:48,033
and go home alone.

295
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:50,367
If it's the one that can't
put a sentence together,

296
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,901
I feed him a power bar and
get him straight into bed.

297
00:12:52,934 --> 00:12:54,133
As long as they don't know

298
00:12:54,167 --> 00:12:56,400
that I know, I am happy

299
00:12:56,434 --> 00:12:59,067
and so are Talky and Humpy.

300
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,501
You're not like the other girls.

301
00:13:01,534 --> 00:13:03,434
Hey, Jessica, I was
just thinking,

302
00:13:03,467 --> 00:13:04,734
you know how on Earth

303
00:13:04,767 --> 00:13:06,443
people walk around and
birds fly in the air?

304
00:13:06,467 --> 00:13:07,534
Yeah.

305
00:13:07,567 --> 00:13:08,834
Did you ever wonder

306
00:13:08,868 --> 00:13:11,033
if on other planets people fly

307
00:13:11,067 --> 00:13:13,367
and the birds walk around, hmm?

308
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,934
Okay.

309
00:13:14,968 --> 00:13:17,234
Here, eat this, and let's
get back to my place.

310
00:13:17,267 --> 00:13:18,267
Ooh.

311
00:13:22,834 --> 00:13:24,167
Hey, honey.

312
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,167
Hey, slugger.

313
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,534
Nice of you to come home.

314
00:13:27,567 --> 00:13:28,901
Now, if you'll excuse me,

315
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:30,834
"Slugger" needs to
be changed again.

316
00:13:30,868 --> 00:13:31,901
I'll do it.

317
00:13:31,934 --> 00:13:33,133
You're drunk. You'll hurt him.

318
00:13:33,167 --> 00:13:35,601
I'm not going to hurt him.
Come here, little fella.

319
00:13:35,634 --> 00:13:37,200
Keith, you're scaring him.

320
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:39,467
Why don't we ever
have sex anymore?

321
00:13:39,501 --> 00:13:40,667
We had sex this morning.

322
00:13:40,701 --> 00:13:42,400
It was like you
weren't even there.

323
00:13:42,434 --> 00:13:45,000
I was.

324
00:13:49,367 --> 00:13:51,767
The next morning I
was feeling uneasy

325
00:13:51,801 --> 00:13:53,534
about Jessica's situation.

326
00:13:53,567 --> 00:13:55,767
In my day,

327
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:59,501
we had names for a
woman like Jessica...

328
00:13:59,534 --> 00:14:01,334
Trollop, harlot,

329
00:14:01,367 --> 00:14:03,534
whore, Mommy...

330
00:14:03,567 --> 00:14:05,033
This is Mr. Pickering.

331
00:14:05,067 --> 00:14:06,501
He's the horrible man

332
00:14:06,534 --> 00:14:09,000
who founded this
company 120 years ago.

333
00:14:09,033 --> 00:14:10,567
Now he's dead.

334
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:14,000
Come on, she's into one guy's
mind and one guy's body.

335
00:14:14,033 --> 00:14:17,000
You're just threatened
by a woman having power.

336
00:14:17,033 --> 00:14:18,334
Nonsense.

337
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,434
I love the fairer sex.

338
00:14:20,467 --> 00:14:24,067
But science tells us it
degrades their femininity

339
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:27,067
if they're allowed
to read or own money

340
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:31,100
or leave the house
or call for help.

341
00:14:31,133 --> 00:14:33,434
You know, there are
pills I could take

342
00:14:33,467 --> 00:14:35,767
that would make you
stop talking to me.

343
00:14:35,801 --> 00:14:37,033
Admit it.

344
00:14:37,067 --> 00:14:40,567
We'd be a lot better off
if we had kept that rib in

345
00:14:40,601 --> 00:14:42,701
and just buggered each other.

346
00:14:42,734 --> 00:14:44,033
Oh.

347
00:14:44,067 --> 00:14:45,467
What was I thinking?

348
00:14:45,501 --> 00:14:47,434
Nobody would be hard on a man

349
00:14:47,467 --> 00:14:49,734
for doing what
Jessica was doing.

350
00:14:49,767 --> 00:14:52,133
She didn't need me
to protect her.

351
00:14:52,167 --> 00:14:53,968
So you don't mind
taking my seconds?

352
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,167
Not when they're so fine.

353
00:14:56,701 --> 00:14:59,868
I'd never mind sharing a
piece with my brother.

354
00:14:59,901 --> 00:15:01,534
Hey, you like it your way,

355
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:02,601
I like it mine.

356
00:15:02,634 --> 00:15:04,467
I got to tell you...

357
00:15:04,501 --> 00:15:07,234
that sweet pie
tastes even sweeter

358
00:15:07,267 --> 00:15:10,234
knowing my bro's
getting some, too.

359
00:15:10,267 --> 00:15:11,334
Oh, yeah.

360
00:15:12,267 --> 00:15:13,801
You feel pretty smart.

361
00:15:13,834 --> 00:15:16,934
You think you're pulling
one over on the pie?

362
00:15:16,968 --> 00:15:19,334
Well, the pie's pulling
one over on you.

363
00:15:19,367 --> 00:15:21,834
Because the pie
knows everything.

364
00:15:25,834 --> 00:15:28,734
You're talking about
an actual pie?

365
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:29,801
Of course.

366
00:15:29,834 --> 00:15:31,234
We kept referring to it as pie.

367
00:15:31,267 --> 00:15:33,367
I don't see how there could
have been any confusion.

368
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,100
Were you talking about Jessica?

369
00:15:36,133 --> 00:15:37,467
What?!

370
00:15:37,501 --> 00:15:38,934
No, of course not.

371
00:15:38,968 --> 00:15:42,501
I just get a little
overprotective sometimes.

372
00:15:43,934 --> 00:15:45,634
Of pie?

373
00:15:47,133 --> 00:15:48,968
Yes.

374
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,367
You get away from this.

375
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,801
Okay, I screwed up.

376
00:15:54,834 --> 00:15:56,167
But you heard them.

377
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,100
How could anyone get so
crazily enthusiastic

378
00:15:58,133 --> 00:16:00,868
about a piece of pie?

379
00:16:00,901 --> 00:16:04,534
Oh, sweet crusted son of God!

380
00:16:06,501 --> 00:16:08,968
You told Ben and
Peter that I know.

381
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,968
I'm sorry.

382
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,267
I wasn't going to say anything

383
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,300
but they were having
this insane conversation

384
00:16:13,334 --> 00:16:14,467
about pie, and...

385
00:16:14,501 --> 00:16:15,667
Everything was great

386
00:16:15,701 --> 00:16:17,210
when they thought
they were fooling me,

387
00:16:17,234 --> 00:16:19,434
and you almost ruined it.

388
00:16:19,467 --> 00:16:21,767
Luckily, I convinced them
that the three of us

389
00:16:21,801 --> 00:16:23,400
could still make it as a couple.

390
00:16:23,434 --> 00:16:26,334
Don't you think this whole
thing is kind of unhealthy?

391
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,734
You know what I
think is unhealthy?

392
00:16:27,767 --> 00:16:29,968
You butting in to
my relationships.

393
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,076
Stay out of my love life! Boy,
Jessica's really mad at me.

394
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,734
I've got to do something.

395
00:16:33,767 --> 00:16:34,976
Let me decide who I want
to be involved with.

396
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,567
Here, taste this pie.

397
00:16:36,601 --> 00:16:38,467
It will explain everything.

398
00:16:38,501 --> 00:16:41,000
I don't want any of
your stupid pie.

399
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:42,767
I'm really mad at you, Andy...

400
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,534
Oh, my God.

401
00:16:47,701 --> 00:16:49,968
I'm not upset with you anymore.

402
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,367
All I can think
about is this pie.

403
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,501
All hail Andy,

404
00:16:54,534 --> 00:16:57,100
bringer of great pie!

405
00:17:00,234 --> 00:17:01,501
What are you doing?

406
00:17:01,534 --> 00:17:02,968
Get away from me!

407
00:17:09,567 --> 00:17:11,267
Hey, Champ.

408
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,868
Hey, guys.

409
00:17:12,901 --> 00:17:14,868
You got a second?

410
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:16,801
Okay.

411
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:24,834
Keith and I have been talking.

412
00:17:24,868 --> 00:17:27,868
We know that we've been
fighting a lot lately.

413
00:17:27,901 --> 00:17:29,100
That's probably been

414
00:17:29,133 --> 00:17:31,033
pretty hard on you, huh, sport?

415
00:17:31,067 --> 00:17:32,767
Kinda.

416
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,801
Yeah, we thought so.

417
00:17:34,834 --> 00:17:36,901
And I bet you feel like
all this fighting's

418
00:17:36,934 --> 00:17:38,701
your fault, huh?

419
00:17:38,734 --> 00:17:40,133
Yeah.

420
00:17:40,167 --> 00:17:42,667
Well, it is.

421
00:17:42,701 --> 00:17:44,834
What?

422
00:17:44,868 --> 00:17:47,434
Hey, let's get your
suitcase, cowboy.

423
00:17:51,868 --> 00:17:53,000
You guys are right.

424
00:17:53,033 --> 00:17:55,234
My back has been
feeling a lot better,

425
00:17:55,267 --> 00:17:57,467
so I don't want you
to worry about me

426
00:17:57,501 --> 00:17:59,400
because I'm going to be just...

427
00:18:01,534 --> 00:18:04,934
Does this mean we're
not nurturing people?

428
00:18:04,968 --> 00:18:05,968
We did okay at first.

429
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,634
I just think we tried
to do too much.

430
00:18:07,667 --> 00:18:08,968
Yeah.

431
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,100
Maybe we should start smaller, like...
get a fish.

432
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:16,467
Mm. Maybe we could
just have fish.

433
00:18:16,501 --> 00:18:18,300
You mean like make fish?

434
00:18:18,334 --> 00:18:20,801
I don't think we're
ready for that.

435
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:23,067
Yeah. Let's just go out.

436
00:18:26,934 --> 00:18:29,100
And, you know, you're
not supposed to kayak

437
00:18:29,133 --> 00:18:30,601
in the Venice canals, but...

438
00:18:30,634 --> 00:18:33,334
that starry night, the
lady of the Adriatic

439
00:18:33,367 --> 00:18:37,167
was so enchanting I just
couldn't help myself.

440
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,767
You have a beautiful soul.

441
00:18:40,801 --> 00:18:43,133
Ooh, gosh, look at the time.

442
00:18:43,167 --> 00:18:46,367
I've got to get home and
sleep with your brother.

443
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,400
Uh... Jessica, you
know, I've been having

444
00:18:49,434 --> 00:18:52,300
second thoughts about
this arrangement.

445
00:18:52,334 --> 00:18:53,801
Really? Yes.

446
00:18:53,834 --> 00:18:57,067
Well, maybe you could write
a poem or something.

447
00:19:02,868 --> 00:19:04,167
You liked that, huh?

448
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,634
Oh, boy!

449
00:19:07,667 --> 00:19:09,167
You know, I've been working

450
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,000
on some theories about politics.

451
00:19:11,033 --> 00:19:12,801
Oh, boy.

452
00:19:12,834 --> 00:19:14,834
Yeah, I picked up this
book about the Kennedys...

453
00:19:14,868 --> 00:19:16,534
Jack and Jackie...

454
00:19:16,567 --> 00:19:20,367
Peter, I had a lovely conversation
with your brother earlier

455
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,968
and I just had a lot
of sex with you.

456
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,834
Now I'm really tired.

457
00:19:26,767 --> 00:19:28,033
Jessica...

458
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:29,834
I can't live like this.

459
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:31,434
When we agreed to
this arrangement,

460
00:19:31,467 --> 00:19:33,033
I thought I could win you over

461
00:19:33,067 --> 00:19:35,834
so that one day I would
have all of you.

462
00:19:35,868 --> 00:19:37,267
Hey, I want all of you, too.

463
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,200
And if you would just
listen to my theories

464
00:19:39,234 --> 00:19:40,834
about stuff and things...

465
00:19:40,868 --> 00:19:43,734
Peter, she is not going
to leave me for you.

466
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:46,133
Well, she's not going
to leave me for you.

467
00:19:46,167 --> 00:19:48,667
A woman needs more than
just talk, Mr. Talk.

468
00:19:48,701 --> 00:19:50,067
Guys...

469
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,400
That's the best you can do, huh?
Mr. Talk?

470
00:19:52,434 --> 00:19:53,777
Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk,
Talk, talk, talk, talk,

471
00:19:53,801 --> 00:19:55,367
talk, talk, talk, talk...
Look, Jessica,

472
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,868
I've been practicing
how to kiss.

473
00:19:56,901 --> 00:19:58,834
Let me show you.
Talk, talk, talk.

474
00:20:04,067 --> 00:20:05,167
Hey. Hi.

475
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,501
Can I come in?

476
00:20:06,534 --> 00:20:07,701
Of course.

477
00:20:07,734 --> 00:20:10,000
Is something wrong?

478
00:20:10,033 --> 00:20:11,934
We broke up.

479
00:20:11,968 --> 00:20:13,167
All three of you?

480
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,267
No, they're still together,

481
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,801
but I'm alone again.

482
00:20:16,834 --> 00:20:20,100
Just me and this pie.

483
00:20:20,133 --> 00:20:21,968
Well, in about five seconds,

484
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,300
you're going to be
totally alone again.

485
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,868
I'm sorry I got so mad at you.

486
00:20:29,901 --> 00:20:31,443
I know you were just trying
to watch out for me.

487
00:20:31,467 --> 00:20:32,701
No, it's okay.

488
00:20:32,734 --> 00:20:34,868
I get a little
overprotective sometimes.

489
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:38,534
I like that you look out for me.

490
00:20:38,567 --> 00:20:40,934
I think it's really sweet.

491
00:20:40,968 --> 00:20:44,234
Well, people should
be sweet to you.

492
00:20:53,234 --> 00:20:55,734
You have a whistling booger.

493
00:20:55,767 --> 00:20:58,267
I thought it was you.

494
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,400
I'm pretty sure it's you.

495
00:20:59,434 --> 00:21:00,901
Be quiet a second.

496
00:21:04,033 --> 00:21:06,834
Oh, yeah, you're right. It's me.

497
00:21:06,868 --> 00:21:07,834
Yeah, see? Yeah.

498
00:21:07,868 --> 00:21:10,133
Let's have some pie. All right.

499
00:21:10,167 --> 00:21:12,701
It was really Jessica with
the whistling booger,

500
00:21:12,734 --> 00:21:14,334
but I let her think it was me

501
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:17,334
because she was the one who
was emotionally vulnerable.

502
00:21:17,367 --> 00:21:22,267
And sometimes, that's what
friends do for each other.
