00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:31,772
Boston, please, confirm

5
00:00:31,773 --> 00:00:35,497
Northeast 1156
heading to 600, over.

6
00:00:35,498 --> 00:00:37,264
That's a negative, White Plains.
No visual of the dash-8

7
00:00:37,265 --> 00:00:38,565
in question.

8
00:00:38,566 --> 00:00:42,512
-Confirm weather delay.
-That's negative. We can't confirm
any interference this time.

9
00:00:42,513 --> 00:00:44,319
Tune in 298 for reports.

10
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,749
Liberty 298.
This is Boston Control.

11
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,968
Good evening, Boston.
Liberty 298 with you

12
00:00:48,969 --> 00:00:50,617
flight level 370.

13
00:00:50,618 --> 00:00:53,264
You look after your left site.
5 miles for a dash-8.

14
00:00:53,265 --> 00:00:54,628
You see anything?

15
00:00:55,554 --> 00:00:57,506
That's a negative, Boston.

16
00:00:57,507 --> 00:00:58,807
Nothing in sight.

17
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:00,296
Alright, keep an eye for us.

18
00:01:00,297 --> 00:01:01,811
We had 2 dash-8 take off.

19
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:03,947
but lost contact with them,
over.

20
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,888
Hey folks, we are up here
in the cockpit.

21
00:01:12,889 --> 00:01:14,850
Looks like we runned into
a little bit of turbulence.

22
00:01:14,851 --> 00:01:17,082
So if you are not already
there, please, take your seats,

23
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:18,266
and fasten your seat belts

24
00:01:18,267 --> 00:01:20,597
and I'll try to find us
a smoother altitude.

25
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,725
Can I get you anything?

26
00:01:30,728 --> 00:01:33,250
Hey, guys, sorry
to break up the party.

27
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:36,919
Chloe, I need you to turn
around in your seat

28
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,789
and put your seat belts on
for me, please.

29
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,032
Stay seated this way,
thank you.

30
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,989
Sorry about that.

31
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:50,177
But just so we're clear,
she started it.

32
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,734
Well, she's an unaccompanied
minor.

33
00:01:53,735 --> 00:01:55,770
She doesn't know any better.
You, however...

34
00:01:55,771 --> 00:01:58,509
I'm also unaccompanied too.
Sadly.

35
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,549
Danny.
And you are Emma.

36
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,404
Excuse me, miss.

37
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:09,010
I have to go
to the girl's room.

38
00:02:09,011 --> 00:02:11,309
OK, I'm coming with you.

39
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,532
It was nice to meet you,
Danny.

40
00:02:16,419 --> 00:02:17,909
<i>Are you having a good flight?</i>

41
00:02:18,393 --> 00:02:19,664
Okay.

42
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:46,898
What the hell?

43
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,999
Emma!

44
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:13,579
Holy shit!

45
00:03:21,008 --> 00:03:24,012
Hey, stop it.
You think I find this cute?

46
00:03:24,013 --> 00:03:27,246
Listen to me, there's something
outside and it's flying right at us.

47
00:03:28,328 --> 00:03:30,011
You're scaring the other
passengers...

48
00:03:30,012 --> 00:03:31,329
Just look.

49
00:03:36,954 --> 00:03:38,504
There's nothing there.

50
00:03:39,191 --> 00:03:40,491
No.

51
00:03:40,492 --> 00:03:41,880
No, it must had just missed us.

52
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,540
It's gotta be somewhere.

53
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:46,678
Danny.
Hey, take you seat.

54
00:03:46,999 --> 00:03:48,356
Danny?

55
00:03:48,357 --> 00:03:50,451
You need to stop.
Right now.

56
00:03:51,992 --> 00:03:53,592
I swear it.

57
00:03:55,252 --> 00:03:57,179
I swear I saw something.

58
00:04:03,718 --> 00:04:06,018
Hey, Chloe, are you ok?

59
00:04:06,777 --> 00:04:08,315
What happened?

60
00:04:08,316 --> 00:04:10,716
You know...
He just feels a little sick.

61
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:12,819
So while he gets better,

62
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,737
let's take you back
to your seat, ok?

63
00:04:26,807 --> 00:04:31,113
Everybody, stay calm.
The lights will be back on
in just a second.

64
00:04:32,137 --> 00:04:33,548
Please, just stay seated

65
00:04:33,549 --> 00:04:35,591
and make sure your
seat belts are buckled.

66
00:04:35,592 --> 00:04:38,530
Everything is fine. Please,
I need you to remain seated.

67
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:40,738
Please, remain seated.

68
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:43,372
-Everything is fine.
-It's above us.

69
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:47,685
What?
It's above us.

70
00:04:57,041 --> 00:05:01,474
We gotta tell the pilot.
Tell him that this thing is above us.

71
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,340
Come on!

72
00:05:16,643 --> 00:05:19,210
Hurry, it's Emma,
open the door.

73
00:05:19,211 --> 00:05:20,511
Hurry!

74
00:05:21,451 --> 00:05:23,639
Get the hell back.
Get seated.

75
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,009
There's something above us.
We have to descend.

76
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,310
Everything is out.

77
00:05:27,311 --> 00:05:29,222
The radio, the controls,
everything.

78
00:05:29,223 --> 00:05:31,189
But then why
aren't we falling?

79
00:06:13,511 --> 00:06:15,263
You stay put, OK?

80
00:06:15,264 --> 00:06:16,864
I'll be here right back!

81
00:06:30,254 --> 00:06:32,133
I can't see anything.

82
00:06:37,247 --> 00:06:39,285
Hit the wipers, Jim.

83
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:44,193
Jim?

84
00:06:44,577 --> 00:06:47,407
I... I got it.

85
00:07:13,995 --> 00:07:15,280
Holy shit!

86
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,000
Where'd it go?

87
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,051
Chloe!

88
00:07:26,308 --> 00:07:28,570
Run, Chloe, run!

89
00:07:28,571 --> 00:07:29,871
Run!

90
00:07:33,663 --> 00:07:35,163
Somebody help!

91
00:07:43,983 --> 00:07:45,383
Damn!

92
00:07:45,384 --> 00:07:46,921
I think you got him, Jim!

93
00:07:49,215 --> 00:07:51,391
Hurry!
Down!

94
00:07:55,805 --> 00:07:57,305
Oh, my God!

95
00:08:21,268 --> 00:08:22,647
Help!

96
00:08:23,816 --> 00:08:25,116
No!

97
00:08:30,763 --> 00:08:32,095
Emma?

98
00:08:35,252 --> 00:08:36,848
Can you hear me?

99
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,670
Emma?

100
00:08:54,298 --> 00:08:55,664
Oh, God!

101
00:09:16,918 --> 00:09:18,561
You son of a bitch!

102
00:10:37,735 --> 00:10:39,234
<i>Come back, White Plains,
come back.</i>

103
00:10:39,235 --> 00:10:41,616
<i>Any read on Liberty 298
since your last report?</i>

104
00:10:41,617 --> 00:10:45,338
<i>Negative, Liberty 298 is still
AWOL as of 1932.</i>

105
00:10:45,339 --> 00:10:47,553
<i>-No sign, Boston.
-Hartford, this is Boston.</i>

106
00:10:47,554 --> 00:10:50,223
<i>Any sign of Liberty 298
on visual, please respond.</i>

107
00:10:50,224 --> 00:10:52,707
<i>Boston, alert,
we have something. We have something.</i>

108
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:55,572
<i>Come back.
Liberty 298, this is White Plains.</i>

109
00:10:55,573 --> 00:10:56,973
<i>How do your read?</i>

110
00:10:56,974 --> 00:10:59,542
<i>Repeat, Liberty 298,
how do you read?</i>

111
00:10:59,543 --> 00:11:02,010
We read you loud and clear,
White Plains.

112
00:11:02,967 --> 00:11:04,453
We lost you
for a second there.

113
00:11:04,454 --> 00:11:06,455
It must've been
one of those solar flares.

114
00:11:07,072 --> 00:11:09,126
It sure gave us a good scare.

115
00:11:25,021 --> 00:11:26,469
There you are, Chloe.

116
00:11:26,815 --> 00:11:29,126
What are you doing
out of your seat?

117
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,932
I wanna go home.

118
