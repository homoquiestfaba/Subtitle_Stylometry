[Cellphone buzzing]

365
00:30:20,209 --> 00:30:21,906
Jade covered the rest.

366
00:30:21,907 --> 00:30:24,953
No leaving, no screaming
to get attention from neighbors,

367
00:30:24,954 --> 00:30:27,564
no speaking to anyone
other than me.

368
00:30:27,565 --> 00:30:30,197
If you do, then...

369
00:30:30,198 --> 00:30:32,831
I kill everyone.

371
00:30:37,574 --> 00:30:39,880
Chico!

372
00:30:39,881 --> 00:30:41,186
Oh, don't do that.

373
00:30:41,187 --> 00:30:42,884
It's just taunting
the poor fella.

374
00:30:42,885 --> 00:30:44,667
Why are you doing this?

375
00:30:44,668 --> 00:30:46,932
What were you supposed
to do tonight?

376
00:30:46,933 --> 00:30:48,497
What do you mean?

377
00:30:48,498 --> 00:30:51,284
What was the one thing
your sister asked you to do?

378
00:30:51,285 --> 00:30:52,806
Take care of the dog.

379
00:30:52,807 --> 00:30:55,114
It's an important thing,
you know, to be a caretaker.

380
00:30:55,115 --> 00:30:56,592
What are you talking about?

381
00:30:56,593 --> 00:30:58,073
I'm saying you were supposed
to take care

382
00:30:58,074 --> 00:30:59,509
of a dog,
and look what's happened.

383
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:01,641
I tried.
You tried?

384
00:31:01,642 --> 00:31:02,904
You mean by spending
all of your time

385
00:31:02,905 --> 00:31:04,579
texting your
worthless friends?

386
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,255
No, he was with me
on the couch.

387
00:31:06,256 --> 00:31:07,734
For how long?

388
00:31:07,735 --> 00:31:09,736
I don't know.
He was there.

389
00:31:09,737 --> 00:31:11,739
You don't even know.
Terrible.

390
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,000
I'm sorry!

good enough, Mia.

What are you doing to him?

395

It's not me, Mia.
It's you.

396
00:31:20,966 --> 00:31:22,880
Why are you doing this? You'll see.

397
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:25,187
But first,
I need you to make a choice.

00:31:28,322 --> 00:31:29,538
Mia!

He says you have
to choose!

401
00:31:30,976 --> 00:31:36,068
You have to choose
between Lani and Chico!

Mia!

Wait! Don't hurt her.

404
00:31:40,202 --> 00:31:42,509
This is crazy. Can't argue with that.

405
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:44,075
Why are you doing this?

406
00:31:44,076 --> 00:31:46,708
I promise to tell you.
Pinky promise.

407
00:31:46,709 --> 00:31:50,288
But right now, you have
to make a choice.

408
00:31:50,289 --> 00:31:53,079
Who do you care about more?
Chico or Lani?

409
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,870
Are you kidding? It's a simple question.

410
00:31:55,871 --> 00:31:57,894
Your sick sister's dog
or the girl

with your boyfriend?

You don't have to do this.
You don't have to hurt anyone.

Wait!

You're out of time!

All right, back inside.

you go inside,

the sooner this will
all be over.

You're scared.

00:34:51,001 --> 00:34:53,046
I guess.

You don't sound like your usual
buoyant self, Mia.

is the matter with you?!

What if I just hang up?

What if I just stop
talking to you?

That's not an option.

But how about this?

since you asked,

we both know you have another
big choice coming up,

457
00:35:16,854 --> 00:35:18,724
but what if there was
a way for you

458
00:35:18,725 --> 00:35:20,574
to not have to
make that choice?

459
00:35:20,575 --> 00:35:22,424
Might that be
appealing to you?

Yes.

00:35:26,646 --> 00:35:28,604
That's what
I thought.

00:35:29,692 --> 00:35:32,172
So?

463
00:35:32,173 --> 00:35:34,958
So, all you have to do
is answer three questions.

464
00:35:34,959 --> 00:35:36,742
That's it.

465
00:35:36,743 --> 00:35:38,353
If you get them right,
then I'll stop this whole thing

and let everyone go.

467
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,791
But if you get
one wrong,

468
00:35:42,792 --> 00:35:47,928
then you have to make a choice
between Nicole...

469
00:35:47,929 --> 00:35:50,104
and Santi.

470
00:35:55,501 --> 00:35:57,110

When administering CPR,
maintaining proper rhythm

about my mother?

Why not?

with this?

I don't remember her
ever speaking about you.

of you much either.
