[Woman Narrating] It's been almost ayear
since I left my home in the East...

4
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,940
and traveled west
with the man I loved.

5
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:52,170
I was positive
about my future...

6
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:54,338
full of hopes and dreams.

7
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:56,348
Our eyes were always
on the end of the trail...

8
00:01:56,416 --> 00:02:00,375
as if life as I envisioned it
would be just that.

9
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:04,617
In fact, if someone had told me
that I would find myself here today...

10
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:06,921
I would have
called them crazy.

11
00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:10,224

and where I was headed...

- We're going north.

He said to go northwest.

Don't you think it's strange
we haven't come upon it yet?

21
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:40,755
Well, we'd be there already if the weight
of these books hadn't slowed us down.

22
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:44,263
Those books will provide us

01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:24,555
[Groaning]

692
01:04:24,627 --> 01:04:26,686
Oh, God,
I can't do this alone.

693
01:04:26,762 --> 01:04:29,060
Please help me.
Please, please help me!

694
01:04:29,131 --> 01:04:31,099
[Groans]

695
01:04:31,167 --> 01:04:34,625
[Marty Yelling]

696
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:36,934
[Clark]
Push. You're doin' fine. You're doin' fine.

697
01:04:37,006 --> 01:04:39,099
- Push. Push.
- [Groaning Continues]

698
01:04:39,175 --> 01:04:41,405
- Come on, push. You're doin' fine.
- [Marty Yells]

699
01:04:41,477 --> 01:04:43,411
You're doin' fine, Marty.
Come on.

700
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:50,812
[Baby Crying]

701
01:04:57,093 --> 01:04:59,084
[Baby Cooing]

702
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:03,623
[Whispering]
I t's a boy. Come here.

703
01:05:08,337 --> 01:05:11,500
You were mooing louder than Gertie
when her baby came out.

704
01:05:15,344 --> 01:05:17,209
Have you got a name?

705
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:19,805
Aaron Luke.

706
01:05:19,882 --> 01:05:23,545
Aaron after his father,
Luke after mine.

707
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:32,322
- It's amazing, isn't it?
- What's that?

708
01:05:32,395 --> 01:05:34,522
- This...
- [Cooing]

709
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:37,794
Powerful love
that just sweeps over you.

710
01:05:39,068 --> 01:05:41,059
It's amazing.

711
01:05:54,483 --> 01:05:56,417
Weather's mighty temptin'.

712
01:05:56,485 --> 01:05:59,249
I thought the fresh air
might do us both some good.

713
01:05:59,322 --> 01:06:02,587
- Yeah. You warm enough?
- Mmm.

714
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:07,929
- He seems to be enjoyin' it.
- [Chuckles]

715
01:06:07,997 --> 01:06:10,397
Hey.

716
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:12,866
[Whinnying]

717
01:06:12,935 --> 01:06:16,098
- Looks like we got company comin'.
- Pa.

718
01:06:16,172 --> 01:06:19,403
Go ahead. You can
do your chores later.

719
01:06:19,475 --> 01:06:21,705
[Ben]
Whoa. Whoa.

720
01:06:21,777 --> 01:06:23,745
Hi, Clint.
Let's go play.

721
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:26,805
Whoa.

722
01:06:28,117 --> 01:06:30,585
- Howdy.
- Ben, Sarah. Welcome.

723
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:34,783
You're lookin' a little more rested
since the last time I paid a visit.

724
01:06:34,857 --> 01:06:38,520
I can hardly believe he's already a month old.
It just doesn't seem possible.

725
01:06:38,594 --> 01:06:42,189
[Chuckles]
Yeah, they grow when you're not lookin'.

726
01:06:42,264 --> 01:06:44,528
Blink and you just
might miss it.

727
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:46,795
That's what Clark said
about Missie.

728
01:06:46,869 --> 01:06:49,929
Clark understands
and appreciates that.

729
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:52,804
He seems to be right fond
oflittle Aaron.

730
01:06:52,875 --> 01:06:54,536
I think he is.

731
01:06:56,779 --> 01:06:59,111
[Sighs]

732
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:07,114
I bet little Aaron has you thinkin'
on his pa a lot lately, huh?

733
01:07:09,792 --> 01:07:12,226
He would have been
so happy...

734
01:07:12,294 --> 01:07:14,285
and proud to have a son.

735
01:07:14,363 --> 01:07:18,595
Babies are a testament
to love.

736
01:07:18,667 --> 01:07:22,000
They're livin' proof of what
you and your husband share together.

737
01:07:23,372 --> 01:07:26,671
Nobody can ever
change that.

738
01:07:29,211 --> 01:07:33,910
I still see Laura's dad
every time her curls are bouncing in the wagon.

739
01:07:33,983 --> 01:07:36,281
Ben had blond curls?

740
01:07:36,352 --> 01:07:38,377
Not Ben, Marty.

741
01:07:38,454 --> 01:07:40,479
Laura's daddy.

742
01:07:40,556 --> 01:07:42,683
He was my first husband.
Thornton.

743
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:49,026
I was a widow.
I had two little ones.

744
01:07:49,098 --> 01:07:53,501
When I met Ben Graham,
he had two young uns of his own.

745
01:07:53,569 --> 01:07:57,130
I guess you might say we joined forces
out of sheer need.

746
01:07:57,206 --> 01:07:59,333
But, Sarah, I...

747
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:04,038
You and Ben,
I just assumed you loved each other.

748
01:08:04,113 --> 01:08:06,104
Oh, we do.

749
01:08:06,182 --> 01:08:08,650
Now.

750
01:08:08,717 --> 01:08:10,981
I got more love in my heart
for that man...

751
01:08:11,053 --> 01:08:13,146
than anybody
oughta be allowed.

752
01:08:13,222 --> 01:08:16,385
I can't even tell you
when it happened.

753
01:08:16,459 --> 01:08:18,450
You know...

754
01:08:18,527 --> 01:08:22,088
sometimes love
isn't fireworks.

755
01:08:22,164 --> 01:08:24,689
Sometimes love
just comes softly.

756
01:08:30,206 --> 01:08:33,369
If you two are through gabbing,
it's time we best be gettin' on.

757
01:08:33,442 --> 01:08:36,809
I will come when
I'm good and ready, Ben Graham.

758
01:08:36,879 --> 01:08:41,873
That's fine, then. Can't say for sure
if the buggy'll still be here when you're ready.

759
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:44,419
Enjoy your pie.

760
01:08:44,487 --> 01:08:46,717
[Both Chuckle]

761
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:48,916
Orney old goat.

762
01:09:05,841 --> 01:09:09,368
- [Groans]
- [Giggling]

763
01:09:09,445 --> 01:09:11,709
[Chuckles]

764
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:14,510
Oh!
[Screaming]

765
01:09:14,583 --> 01:09:18,917
[Yelping]
No! Clark, stop!

766
01:09:20,956 --> 01:09:22,890
Stop! Stop!

767
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:31,091
Pa. Pa.

768
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:33,101
[Laughing]
Stop.

769
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:36,036
You gotyour laugh back.

770
01:09:41,944 --> 01:09:43,775
I think I did.

771
01:09:49,084 --> 01:09:51,143
[Baby Cries]

772
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:53,279
Aaron's cying.

773
01:10:05,568 --> 01:10:08,093
[Baby Crying]

774
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:14,566
- Marty. Marty.
- What?

775
01:10:14,643 --> 01:10:18,238
The barn's on fire.
Staywith the children.

776
01:10:24,486 --> 01:10:29,014
Please, God, if you're really there
and listening to me, take care of Clark.

777
01:10:29,091 --> 01:10:31,082
Please let him
come out all right.

778
01:10:32,561 --> 01:10:35,530
Please, God.

779
01:10:35,598 --> 01:10:37,964
- Come on! Come on! Hyah!
- [Sighs]

780
01:10:38,033 --> 01:10:40,558
[Missie]
Marty, what's happening?

781
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:52,838
[Groans]

782
01:10:57,686 --> 01:10:59,711
Marty...

783
01:11:00,956 --> 01:11:02,924
you realize
you lost your wagon...

784
01:11:02,992 --> 01:11:05,119
and all your possessions
in the fire?

785
01:11:06,195 --> 01:11:08,186
I know.

786
01:11:10,199 --> 01:11:13,862
I made you a promise last fall,
and I intend to keep it.

787
01:11:15,604 --> 01:11:18,664
I'll be going into town soon
to replace that feed.

788
01:11:19,908 --> 01:11:22,433
And if you're wantin' to...

789
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:25,670
we could see about
your way home.

790
01:11:28,217 --> 01:11:30,378
We should put some
ointment on your hands...

791
01:11:30,452 --> 01:11:32,977
and wrap them
so they won't get infected.

792
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:50,499
- Here's some coffee.
- Thankyou.

793
01:11:51,707 --> 01:11:54,039
What are you
going to do?

794
01:11:54,109 --> 01:11:57,545
The neighbors have offered
to collect some logs and raise a new barn.

795
01:11:57,613 --> 01:11:59,877
Ben said he'd take care
of the milk cow...

796
01:11:59,948 --> 01:12:01,882
feed her in exchange
for some milk...

797
01:12:01,950 --> 01:12:04,350
until I get my feed
built back up.

798
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:07,651
I think it's gonna be fine.
Pretty much got it worked out.

799
01:12:07,723 --> 01:12:10,385
Just keep praying
for answers.

800
01:12:10,459 --> 01:12:14,418
- Why do you think he'll answer your prayers?
- He always answers my prayers.

801
01:12:14,496 --> 01:12:17,021
Really?
Did you pray for this?

802
01:12:17,099 --> 01:12:18,566
Marty...

803
01:12:18,634 --> 01:12:21,364
Did you pray to have Ellen
taken away from you?

804
01:12:21,437 --> 01:12:25,032
Did you pray that little Missie
would grow up never knowing her real mother?

805
01:12:25,107 --> 01:12:28,099
I just don't understand
why the god that you pray to...

806
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:30,907
would let such unthinkable things
happen to decent people.

807
01:12:32,214 --> 01:12:34,148
Come with me.

808
01:12:35,484 --> 01:12:37,452
Where?
What about the children?

809
01:12:37,519 --> 01:12:40,579
Missie can watch Aaron
for a little while.

810
01:12:40,656 --> 01:12:43,386
- Where are we going?
- Going to church.

811
01:12:52,101 --> 01:12:55,696
Missie could fall down
and hurt herself...

812
01:12:55,771 --> 01:12:58,934
even if I'm walking
right there beside her.

813
01:12:59,007 --> 01:13:02,033
That doesn't mean
that I allowed it to happen.

814
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:07,475
But she knows,
with a father's unconditional love...

815
01:13:08,684 --> 01:13:11,812
I'll pick her up
and I'll carry her.

816
01:13:12,921 --> 01:13:15,151
I'll try to heal her.

817
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:17,385
I'll cry when she cries.

818
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:20,894
And I'll rejoice
when she is well.

819
01:13:22,865 --> 01:13:25,698
In all the moments
of my life...

820
01:13:25,768 --> 01:13:28,032
God has been
right there beside me.

821
01:13:33,008 --> 01:13:35,476
The truth of God's love...

822
01:13:35,544 --> 01:13:38,741
is not that he allows
bad things to happen.

823
01:13:40,315 --> 01:13:44,115
It's his promise
that he'll be there with us...

824
01:13:46,221 --> 01:13:48,212
when they do.

825
01:13:57,065 --> 01:13:59,295
I'm gonna go back
to the cabin.

826
01:14:01,136 --> 01:14:03,127
Do you wanna stay a while?

827
01:14:04,773 --> 01:14:06,764
All right.

828
01:15:54,316 --> 01:15:56,443
Missie...

829
01:15:56,518 --> 01:15:59,419
would you do me a favor
and get your pa's dirty clothes?

830
01:15:59,488 --> 01:16:02,184
Get. Would you get?

831
01:16:02,257 --> 01:16:04,350
Yes, ma'am, I will.

832
01:16:04,426 --> 01:16:06,394
Oh, Lord.

833
01:16:22,210 --> 01:16:23,768
Mornin'.

834
01:16:23,845 --> 01:16:25,779
Good morning.

835
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:31,811
Smells good.

836
01:16:31,887 --> 01:16:33,878
Excuse me.

837
01:16:36,992 --> 01:16:40,655
That wet winter we had
sure did make the ground soft for plantin'.

838
01:17:03,852 --> 01:17:06,548
I haven't seen you
turn a page for 30 minutes.

839
01:17:07,990 --> 01:17:09,981
I can't seem to concentrate.

840
01:17:11,393 --> 01:17:14,692
I'm going over to
the Grahams' tomorrow.

841
01:17:14,763 --> 01:17:18,563
I'm gonna help Ben brand his new calves.
You wanna come along and visit with Sarah?

842
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:20,602
I don't think so.

843
01:17:22,371 --> 01:17:26,273
I should probably spend the day packing.
It's about that time.

844
01:17:27,776 --> 01:17:29,767
Areyou sure?

845
01:17:36,818 --> 01:17:38,809
I'll let Missie know.

846
01:17:51,033 --> 01:17:53,524
- Missie, come here.
- [Missie] Okay, Pa.

847
01:18:00,108 --> 01:18:02,804
[Indistinct]

848
01:18:15,724 --> 01:18:17,715
[Faint]
I don't want her to go.

849
01:18:19,795 --> 01:18:21,786
[Indistinct]

850
01:18:44,186 --> 01:18:47,178
[Chattering]

851
01:19:01,036 --> 01:19:03,027
Eveything seems to be
in order.

852
01:19:04,039 --> 01:19:06,030
You'll be leaving shortly.

853
01:19:09,611 --> 01:19:11,602
Would you?

854
01:19:14,116 --> 01:19:16,107
[Cooing Softly]

855
01:19:26,795 --> 01:19:29,662
- I wish I didn't have to leave.
- Then stay.

856
01:19:30,732 --> 01:19:32,723
I just can't.

857
01:19:34,236 --> 01:19:36,227
I want you to have my books.

858
01:19:38,173 --> 01:19:40,164
And this.

859
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:46,771
My mother gave it to me.

860
01:19:49,317 --> 01:19:51,512
I might be leaving...

861
01:19:51,586 --> 01:19:54,521
but my love is
staying here with you.

862
01:20:13,942 --> 01:20:17,571
Please say good-bye
to Sarah and Ben for me.

863
01:20:19,581 --> 01:20:22,778
I'll always be grateful
thatyou were there that day.

864
01:20:25,554 --> 01:20:28,352
I don't know
what I would have done.

865
01:20:37,098 --> 01:20:39,032
[Softly]
Bye.

866
01:20:40,335 --> 01:20:42,326
Bye.

867
01:21:08,263 --> 01:21:11,460
Might as well get my things
moved out ofthe lean-to.

868
01:21:11,533 --> 01:21:13,091
Okay.

869
01:21:32,354 --> 01:21:34,345
Father...

870
01:21:36,358 --> 01:21:40,624
I don't know why
you brought Marty into my life...

871
01:21:40,695 --> 01:21:42,822
only to have her
leave like this.

872
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:48,833
I know I don't always
understand your plan...

873
01:21:53,909 --> 01:21:56,173
but I ask you...

874
01:21:56,244 --> 01:21:58,576
with a shattered heart...

875
01:21:58,647 --> 01:22:01,172
please help me
to accept it.

876
01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:06,653
[Sobbing]

877
01:22:09,691 --> 01:22:11,682
Amen.

878
01:22:39,621 --> 01:22:41,589
Missie!

879
01:22:41,656 --> 01:22:46,389
I'm going to bring Marty back. You don't
leave the cabin. I'll be back as soon as I can.

880
01:22:49,164 --> 01:22:51,655
Hyah! Hyah!

881
01:23:05,180 --> 01:23:07,171
Come on!

882
01:23:21,796 --> 01:23:24,856
I'm glad to be leaving
this god forsaken part of the country.

883
01:23:24,933 --> 01:23:27,060
I wouldn't call it
god forsaken.

884
01:23:27,135 --> 01:23:28,932
Horrible snowstorms.

885
01:23:29,004 --> 01:23:32,963
Beautiful sunsets.
Rich soil.

886
01:23:33,041 --> 01:23:35,202
A woman has to be crazy
to stay.

887
01:23:35,276 --> 01:23:37,335
Crazy.

888
01:23:37,412 --> 01:23:39,812
Or in love.

889
01:23:50,225 --> 01:23:52,216
[Clark Yelling]

890
01:23:53,294 --> 01:23:55,285
[Faint]
Marty!

891
01:23:55,363 --> 01:23:59,060
Marty! Marty!

892
01:23:59,134 --> 01:24:01,830
Marty! Marty!

893
01:24:01,903 --> 01:24:03,871
Marty!

894
01:24:03,938 --> 01:24:06,099
What's going on?
Who's Marty?

895
01:24:11,379 --> 01:24:13,370
- [Man] Whoa, whoa.
- [Whinnies]

896
01:24:15,984 --> 01:24:18,179
Clark, what are you doing?

897
01:24:18,253 --> 01:24:21,814
A man loses his woman, he goes after her.
It's as simple as that.

898
01:24:21,890 --> 01:24:23,790
I thought you wanted me to go.

899
01:24:23,858 --> 01:24:26,656
- I didn't see the note.
- You didn't try to stop me.

900
01:24:26,728 --> 01:24:28,821
Until today.

901
01:24:30,732 --> 01:24:32,757
Don't leave.

902
01:24:32,834 --> 01:24:34,825
Stay with us.

903
01:24:34,903 --> 01:24:38,498
Stay with me.
Please.

904
01:24:38,573 --> 01:24:41,371
But... But I have to stay
for the right reasons.

905
01:24:41,443 --> 01:24:43,434
Stay because I love you.

906
01:24:44,646 --> 01:24:47,012
I... I love you.

907
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:49,846
Or maybe...

908
01:24:49,918 --> 01:24:52,386
I should stay
because I love you.

909
01:24:54,422 --> 01:24:56,413
That's a good reason too.

910
01:25:04,699 --> 01:25:06,667
Whoa.

911
01:25:12,707 --> 01:25:14,698
Mama.
