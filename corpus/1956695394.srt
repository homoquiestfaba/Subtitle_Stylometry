once in my life, I'll kill myself.

653
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,989
‐ I thought you said
Lauren touched your penis that one time.

654
00:31:47,574 --> 00:31:48,784
‐ That was a lie.

655
00:31:50,953 --> 00:31:53,956
‐ Okay, yeah.
I'll talk to my guy, all right?

656
00:31:53,956 --> 00:31:56,291
Hey, Sophie! Sophie!

657
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:04,591
Uh, you like coffee?

658
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,306
‐ Yeah, bro, I can only get, like,
two ounces with my medical card.

659
00:32:11,306 --> 00:32:13,225
Nick, you got a card?
‐ Yo, man, can I swing?

661
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:17,563
The kid's gonna ripped off.
You should go with him to the party.

662

‐ I ain't goin' to the party.
‐ Why not?

663

‐ Seriously, man, can I bat?

664
00:32:21,024 --> 00:32:23,819
‐ I can't go to the party,
because Mo's a minor.

665
00:32:23,819 --> 00:32:25,237
So, if Mo gets in trouble,

666
00:32:25,237 --> 00:32:26,989
he'll just get in trouble
like those kids get in trouble.

667
00:32:26,989 --> 00:32:29,575
You know, he'll have to,
like, erase a blackboard

668
00:32:29,575 --> 00:32:31,910
or go to detention.
Me? I'll do hard time!

669
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:34,580
I'm not ready for that.
I can't be the face of this operation.

670
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:37,291
‐ Well, I don't wanna be
the face of this operation, either.

671

‐ Yo, hit.
‐ Oh, come on!

672
00:32:41,837 --> 00:32:43,505
‐ Step up, kid.

673
00:32:45,716 --> 00:32:47,426
ZEKE:
What the fuck was that?

674
00:32:47,426 --> 00:32:49,052
MO: That one didn't feel good.
‐ Do you listen?

675
00:32:49,052 --> 00:32:50,262
Remember what I told you?
‐ No.

676
00:32:50,262 --> 00:32:51,513
‐ You gotta use your height
to your advantage.

677
00:32:51,513 --> 00:32:53,140
You gotta get low,
so there's no strike zone.

678
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,349
You'll walk every time.

679
00:32:54,349 --> 00:32:56,935
TONY: He's in a fucking cage, man.
He can't strike out.

I never saw you do this.

682
00:33:02,024 --> 00:33:04,818
‐ Okay, if you're so good,
why'd you leave the team?

683
00:33:04,818 --> 00:33:06,570
‐ 'Cause it‐‐ it was very political.

684
00:33:07,321 --> 00:33:10,449
MO: Oh, hey, can you take the next right?
Take a right up there.

685
00:33:10,449 --> 00:33:12,201
ZEKE: Why? All right, all right.
Where are we going?

686
00:33:12,201 --> 00:33:14,494
‐ Uh, I just have to stop by
my sister's new place

687
00:33:14,494 --> 00:33:17,331
and pick up a box
that she wants me to store for her.

688
00:33:17,331 --> 00:33:19,291
‐ Huh? Fuck no! What?

689
00:33:19,291 --> 00:33:21,293
‐ What? Are you‐‐?
Why are you freaking out?

690
00:33:21,293 --> 00:33:23,504
‐ I can't just show up
to your sister's house unannounced.

691
00:33:23,504 --> 00:33:24,588
I'd look insane.

692
00:33:24,588 --> 00:33:26,340
‐ You're not showing up unannounced.
You're with me.

693
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,634
‐ It's fucking weird, dude.
Does she know I'm coming?

694
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:32,930
‐ No, but I didn't talk to her, okay?
My mom did.

695
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:34,598
‐ This sucks, bro.
You suck.

696
00:33:34,598 --> 00:33:36,934
Dude, is her stupid‐ass boyfriend
gonna be there?

697

[laughing]

698
00:33:39,937 --> 00:33:41,688
What are you laughing at.
‐ I don't know.

699
00:33:41,688 --> 00:33:44,441
It just‐‐ it brings me a lot of joy
to see you this flustered.

700
00:33:44,441 --> 00:33:45,692
Never seen you like this.

701
00:33:47,402 --> 00:33:48,403
‐ You're mean.

702
00:33:52,741 --> 00:33:55,160
All right, I'm gonna wait in the car.

703
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,620
MO: [scoffs]
Fine.

704
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:03,752

like an asshole.

705
00:34:05,212 --> 00:34:06,421
Wait up.

I used to love that spot as a kid.

We're the same age.

715
00:34:31,446 --> 00:34:34,032
You didn't say
you were bringing your babysitter.

‐ Sure. Yeah.
‐ Okay.

719

Don't you have homework or something?
‐ Yeah, don't you?

720
00:34:41,915 --> 00:34:44,918
'Cause then Mom and Dad
are gonna be mad at me,

721
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:46,670
and I don't want them to do that.
‐ Come on, stick around for one.

722
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,630
Beer for the big guy,
Coke for the little guy.

723

Really nice place, guys.

The painting. Yes.

DOUG: Yeah, all of his stuff
sort of makes fun of

730
00:35:06,023 --> 00:35:08,150
the over‐commercialization
of the art market.

731
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,318

super into collecting recently.

‐ Oh, have you?
Oh, that's nice.

736
00:35:17,868 --> 00:35:20,579

it'd be a really good investment, so...

Kinda just been diving in head‐first.

‐ [chuckles]
What?

745
00:35:37,888 --> 00:35:40,974

‐ Right. But... but...

1630
01:24:55,554 --> 01:24:58,182
‐ Yeah?
‐ We have...

1631
01:24:58,891 --> 01:25:01,727
a memory. We have a memory
that we get to share together.

1632
01:25:01,727 --> 01:25:04,062
‐ Not a lot of people get that, right?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

1633
01:25:04,062 --> 01:25:06,064
‐ Yeah. Mmm.
‐ Sure.

1634
01:25:08,984 --> 01:25:11,278
‐ Yo, did I tell you?
I wrote a script!

1635
01:25:11,278 --> 01:25:14,615
Like, a movie. Like, yeah...
‐ No way!

1636
01:25:14,615 --> 01:25:15,699
‐ Yeah!
‐ Did you actually?

1637
01:25:15,699 --> 01:25:19,745
‐ Yeah, yeah. It's like
a horror‐action‐comedy type thing.

1638
01:25:19,745 --> 01:25:21,955
And, uh, there's actually
a character in it based off you.

1639
01:25:21,955 --> 01:25:23,707
I think you'd like it.
‐ Yeah, can I read it sometime?

1640
01:25:23,707 --> 01:25:27,961
‐ I haven't written it actually yet.
It's in my head right now.

1641
01:25:27,961 --> 01:25:29,129
It's in that process.

1642
01:25:29,129 --> 01:25:31,715
But I will write it down.
I heard that is the easiest part.

1643
01:25:31,715 --> 01:25:33,634
So, yeah, we'll cross that bridge
when it comes.

1644
01:25:33,634 --> 01:25:36,053
‐ Cool.
‐ Very cool.

1645
01:25:36,053 --> 01:25:37,179
‐ Yeah.
‐ Yeah.

1646
01:25:39,264 --> 01:25:42,184
So, uh, what are you doing later?
I haven't seen you in, like, forever.

1647
01:25:42,184 --> 01:25:43,894
You wanna hang out or something?

1648
01:25:43,894 --> 01:25:45,687
‐ No, I sort of have to hang out
with my parents tonight.

1649
01:25:45,687 --> 01:25:47,147
You know.

1650
01:25:47,147 --> 01:25:49,274
But, uh, yo, you wanna come?

1651
01:25:49,274 --> 01:25:53,570
‐ Ha! No thanks.
Yeah, I get it. Um...

1652
01:25:53,570 --> 01:25:55,155
Okay, if not, maybe tomorrow?

1653
01:25:55,155 --> 01:25:57,741
I'm off tomorrow actually.
Tomorrow's better. Tomorrow?

1654
01:25:57,741 --> 01:26:00,577
‐ Sure. Maybe. Yeah.
‐ Cool.

1655
01:26:00,577 --> 01:26:02,538
‐ I'll, uh, I'll let you know.
‐ Okay.

1656
01:26:06,333 --> 01:26:09,294
‐ All right, I guess somebody
who works here will fix that.

1657
01:26:10,337 --> 01:26:12,256
See you tomorrow?
‐ Yeah, I'll see you around, man.

1658
01:26:12,256 --> 01:26:13,841
‐ Tight. I'll walk you out. Come on.
