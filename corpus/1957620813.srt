175
00:09:57,684 --> 00:09:59,424
Scary, isn't it?

176
00:09:59,468 --> 00:10:01,905
When someone wants
something that bad.

177
00:10:05,343 --> 00:10:07,824
They were under pressure
for a long time.

178
00:10:07,868 --> 00:10:10,131
Maybe she just went to
the boat to get away from it

179
00:10:10,174 --> 00:10:13,090
for a couple of hours
and got lost.

180
00:10:13,134 --> 00:10:17,965
Or maybe she found herself,
and just kept on going.

181
00:10:18,008 --> 00:10:19,836
[man]
Stars on the Horizon.

182
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,708
Well, I'd say this one
goes on the mantle.

183
00:10:21,751 --> 00:10:23,927
Kathy's out buying
a frame right now.

184
00:10:23,971 --> 00:10:25,668
Here, take it.
If I look at this

185
00:10:25,712 --> 00:10:27,670
one more time, I'm gonna
become unbearable.

186
00:10:27,714 --> 00:10:29,672
Oh, let's look into
the future a minute, John.

187
00:10:29,716 --> 00:10:32,240
"An attractive candidate
with unlimited potential."

188
00:10:32,283 --> 00:10:34,590
Does that sound vaguely...Mm-mm, no, no.

189
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,244
I don't think
we should say it?Presidential?

190
00:10:36,287 --> 00:10:37,724
I don't think we
should say...

191
00:10:37,767 --> 00:10:39,813
[cheering and applause]

192
00:10:42,293 --> 00:10:45,253
You've got the polls?
John in a walk?

193
00:10:45,296 --> 00:10:48,038
A walk? A backstroke!

194
00:10:48,082 --> 00:10:50,475
We're 22 points ahead,
gentlemen.

195
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,695
[cheering and applause]

196
00:10:56,917 --> 00:10:58,962
Yeah!
Ha-ha.

197
00:11:01,965 --> 00:11:04,533
[thunder rumbling]

198
00:11:19,113 --> 00:11:21,506
I thought we had a deal.
No secrets.

199
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,726
You were gonna
level with me.

200
00:11:26,424 --> 00:11:28,905
Front page photograph.

201
00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:31,647
You think your little
massacre in Vietnam

202
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,041
is gonna be
a campaign issue?

203
00:11:34,084 --> 00:11:37,435
Is it true?

204
00:11:37,479 --> 00:11:38,741
What?

205
00:11:38,785 --> 00:11:42,745
The things in the paper.

206
00:11:42,789 --> 00:11:44,312
Things?

207
00:11:44,355 --> 00:11:45,748
About you.
The massacre.

208
00:11:45,792 --> 00:11:48,925
You know what
I'm talking about.

209
00:11:48,969 --> 00:11:52,755
Everything's true.
Everything's not true.

210
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:56,106
Just hang in there, okay?

211
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:58,935
I'm your wife.

212
00:11:58,979 --> 00:12:01,677
Right.

213
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,592
So?

214
00:12:07,988 --> 00:12:11,252
So... nothing.

215
00:12:19,521 --> 00:12:21,653
[woman on TV] 
What we're seeing 
throughout the country

216
00:12:21,697 --> 00:12:24,482
is a great deal of very 
sweeping change.

217
00:12:24,526 --> 00:12:27,224
Sweeping incumbents out 
but just as emphatically

218
00:12:27,268 --> 00:12:29,183
sweeping new faces in.

219
00:12:29,226 --> 00:12:32,490
Some of this is unexpected, 
or at least the extent of it.

220
00:12:32,534 --> 00:12:35,319
But undoubtedly the biggest 
shocker of the night

221
00:12:35,363 --> 00:12:36,930
isn't even a shocker.

222
00:12:36,973 --> 00:12:39,584
In the Minnesota Senate race, 
John Waylan,

223
00:12:39,628 --> 00:12:42,413
the odds-on favorite, 
plummeted in the polls

224
00:12:42,457 --> 00:12:43,980
with the revelation 
of his role

225
00:12:44,024 --> 00:12:46,809
in the infamous 
Son My massacre.

226
00:12:46,853 --> 00:12:48,811
Early returns indicate 
that Waylan

227
00:12:48,855 --> 00:12:51,814
may not even carry 
his own home district.

228
00:12:51,858 --> 00:12:54,295
[cheering and applause]

229
00:12:57,646 --> 00:13:02,390
Ladies and gentlemen. 
My friends.

230
00:13:02,433 --> 00:13:07,177
All of you who worked so hard.

231
00:13:07,221 --> 00:13:09,527
It's been one heck 
of a ride, hasn't it?

232
00:13:09,571 --> 00:13:13,444
[cheering and applause]

233
00:13:13,488 --> 00:13:19,320
Sometimes it was hard to 
keep going, to keep dreaming.

234
00:13:19,363 --> 00:13:23,063
But I always knew 
I had your support.

235
00:13:23,106 --> 00:13:28,938
I always knew you shared with 
me the dream of a new start,

236
00:13:28,982 --> 00:13:33,290
a fresh beginning 
for a brilliant future.

237
00:13:38,382 --> 00:13:43,866
A... a brilliant future.

238
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:46,347
I can't tell you how much 
it means to know

239
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:51,221
that you gave me 
your faith, your trust.

240
00:13:51,265 --> 00:13:56,357
You gave me your love.

241
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,794
It is love, 
isn't it?

242
00:14:11,502 --> 00:14:13,722
I'm so...

243
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,119
I am so...

244
00:14:31,131 --> 00:14:33,611
[grunting]

245
00:14:58,027 --> 00:15:00,900
Stay there!
Just stay there!

246
00:15:05,382 --> 00:15:06,949
Are you afraid of me?

247
00:15:06,993 --> 00:15:08,124
Is that it?No!

248
00:15:08,168 --> 00:15:09,647
You think I kill children,

249
00:15:09,691 --> 00:15:10,735
that's why you're
afraid of me?

250
00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:14,391
No!Oh, Kathy. I love you.

251
00:15:14,435 --> 00:15:17,612
You know I love you.

252
00:15:17,655 --> 00:15:22,225
I love you so much!
I don't want to lose you.

253
00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:24,836
[sobbing]

254
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:30,146
It was such
a long time ago.

255
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:32,627
All I want to know is
one thing, Cowboy.

256
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,237
How come
you didn't tell me?

257
00:15:34,281 --> 00:15:35,978
For heaven's sakes, Tony.

258
00:15:36,022 --> 00:15:38,241
No, I mean that.
We're friends.

259
00:15:38,285 --> 00:15:41,549
Friends tell each other.
It's simple.

260
00:15:41,592 --> 00:15:43,203
You want to play Russian
roulette with the truth,

261
00:15:43,246 --> 00:15:44,639
Senator,
that's your business.

262
00:15:44,682 --> 00:15:46,684
I just want to know why
you had to deal me in.

263
00:15:46,728 --> 00:15:47,990
Tony.No.

264
00:15:48,034 --> 00:15:49,426
This isn't doing any good--

265
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:51,167
No, no, no.
No problem.

266
00:15:51,211 --> 00:15:52,821
I would have
thought of something.

267
00:15:52,864 --> 00:15:55,998
Wait a minute,
wait a minute, I got it.

268
00:15:56,042 --> 00:15:58,609
It's coming to me...
a whole new spiel

269
00:15:58,653 --> 00:16:01,917
that will turn this thing
and make it work for us.

270
00:16:03,266 --> 00:16:05,573
"A village is a terrible
thing to waste."

271
00:16:05,616 --> 00:16:07,096
Tony!You like it?

272
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:10,404
You can have it, the next
time you run for office.

273
00:16:10,447 --> 00:16:12,580
Is there anything
that I can do?

274
00:16:12,623 --> 00:16:14,408
Pat...

275
00:16:14,451 --> 00:16:16,584
I can't believe he never
said anything about this.

276
00:16:16,627 --> 00:16:18,368
I'll leave the keys for
the cottage in your mailbox.

277
00:16:18,412 --> 00:16:20,501
You'll need
somewhere to go.

278
00:16:28,944 --> 00:16:30,641
[sighs]

279
00:16:34,471 --> 00:16:36,256
We've lost everything.

280
00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:40,564
Not everything.

281
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:46,875
We have each other.

282
00:17:29,961 --> 00:17:32,703
I'm getting a beer.
You want anything?

283
00:17:32,747 --> 00:17:35,097
Sure. Where are the fish?

284
00:17:35,141 --> 00:17:38,100
Fish.

285
00:17:38,144 --> 00:17:40,798
It's not my calling,
I guess.

286
00:18:19,185 --> 00:18:22,579
[phone ringing]

287
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,858
[sighs]

288
00:18:40,902 --> 00:18:43,165
I could stay
here forever.

289
00:18:46,386 --> 00:18:48,170
Forever?

290
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:52,392
Forever.

291
00:19:02,053 --> 00:19:06,667
Okay... you can get a job

292
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:09,365
with one of those fancy
law firms in Minneapolis,

293
00:19:09,409 --> 00:19:11,585
and we'll get
a cheap house.

294
00:19:11,628 --> 00:19:14,065
No, we'll rent.

295
00:19:14,109 --> 00:19:16,764
That way, we can
pay off some debts,

296
00:19:16,807 --> 00:19:18,635
and in a year
or two we'll...

297
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:20,768
we'll jump on
a plane to Verona,

298
00:19:20,811 --> 00:19:22,900
or wherever else
we want to go.

299
00:19:22,944 --> 00:19:26,382
And we'll... and we'll
be happy together

300
00:19:26,426 --> 00:19:29,646
and we'll do all the wonderful
things we've never done.

301
00:19:32,475 --> 00:19:33,868
We'll do it.

302
00:19:33,911 --> 00:19:35,870
We'll go out
and make it happen.

303
00:19:35,913 --> 00:19:39,613
Verona, huh?

304
00:19:39,656 --> 00:19:42,093
Okay, let's do it.

305
00:19:42,137 --> 00:19:43,617
You promise?

306
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,575
Absolutely.

307
00:19:49,275 --> 00:19:50,841
What about babies?

308
00:19:50,885 --> 00:19:53,235
Especially that.

309
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:54,845
I might be too old.

310
00:19:54,889 --> 00:19:57,283
No, you're not.I'm 38.

311
00:19:57,326 --> 00:20:01,939
No sweat.
We'll have 38 babies.

312
00:20:01,983 --> 00:20:05,465
Hire a bus in Verona.

313
00:20:05,508 --> 00:20:07,423
You think so?

314
00:20:07,467 --> 00:20:10,774
For sure.
I promise.

315
00:20:23,352 --> 00:20:26,094
This stupid thing
we've got to get through.

316
00:20:26,137 --> 00:20:27,617
Stupid?

317
00:20:27,661 --> 00:20:28,836
I didn't mean...

318
00:20:28,879 --> 00:20:30,490
Of course not.

319
00:20:30,533 --> 00:20:34,189
John, I don't always
use the right words,

320
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:37,148
but all I mean is, that
there's this man who I love,

321
00:20:37,192 --> 00:20:40,630
this wonderful man, and I
just want him to be happy,

322
00:20:40,674 --> 00:20:42,284
and that's all
I care about.

323
00:20:42,328 --> 00:20:45,809
Kathy.
Come here, please.

324
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:59,388
Happy.

325
00:20:59,432 --> 00:21:01,216
Nothing else.

326
00:21:02,522 --> 00:21:06,177
There were flies everywhere.

327
00:21:06,221 --> 00:21:09,877
They made a sound 
like tracers.

328
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,924
Moving past. 
Big flies.

329
00:21:13,968 --> 00:21:16,579
Like the blue flies back home

330
00:21:16,623 --> 00:21:20,540
but they didn't 
have any color.

331
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:24,152
Sometimes you couldn't 
see them.

332
00:21:24,195 --> 00:21:28,330
Just the sound 
and the movement.

333
00:21:28,374 --> 00:21:32,508
The movement of the sound.

334
00:21:32,552 --> 00:21:36,599
Whenever I think of the 'Nam, 
I think of the flies.

335
00:21:36,643 --> 00:21:38,819
[knocking]Come on in.

336
00:21:38,862 --> 00:21:41,952
What do you mean you 
weren't discriminating, 
Private Thinbill?

337
00:21:41,996 --> 00:21:43,563
[woman]
That's all there is.

338
00:21:43,606 --> 00:21:45,260
I didn't discriminate 
against the individuals

339
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,696
in the village, sir. 
They were all the enemy.

340
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,219
All the enemy was 
to be destroyed.

341
00:21:48,263 --> 00:21:49,656
[man] So you killed men, women and...

342
00:21:49,699 --> 00:21:51,962
[video fast forwarding]

343
00:21:52,006 --> 00:21:55,792
I remember Sorcerer, he was 
trying to hold Boots' lungs

344
00:21:55,836 --> 00:21:59,187
on the inside, 
and I was on the radio,

345
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:02,538
and that's when 
the lieutenant said

346
00:22:02,582 --> 00:22:04,801
we was gonna waste Son My.

347
00:22:08,414 --> 00:22:12,026
[clears throat] 
Killed every one of them.

348
00:22:16,683 --> 00:22:18,380
Every one.

349
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:24,125
The lieutenant.

350
00:22:26,432 --> 00:22:29,391
Me.

351
00:22:29,435 --> 00:22:32,002
Weatherby.

352
00:22:32,046 --> 00:22:34,614
The Sorcerer 
and all the others.

353
00:22:38,922 --> 00:22:41,272
And we just left 'em there.

354
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,279
Left 'em for the flies.

355
00:23:38,504 --> 00:23:41,724
Where are you?
Hey!

356
00:23:41,768 --> 00:23:43,465
[laughter]

357
00:23:43,509 --> 00:23:45,467
Amazing, the things
you find down there.

358
00:23:45,511 --> 00:23:47,382
Oh, really?Yes.

359
00:23:49,384 --> 00:23:51,865
It's amazing what
you find up here.

360
00:23:55,346 --> 00:23:57,261
I have a secret to tell you.Okay.

361
00:23:57,305 --> 00:23:59,350
Come below.

362
00:24:06,836 --> 00:24:10,579
[Kathy laughing]

363
00:24:10,623 --> 00:24:12,668
The only thing
I haven't figured out,

364
00:24:12,712 --> 00:24:15,932
besides from how we make
38 babies in Verona,

365
00:24:15,976 --> 00:24:19,066
is how we pay
for the tour bus.

366
00:24:19,109 --> 00:24:21,155
You serious?

367
00:24:21,198 --> 00:24:23,505
No. But I can be.

368
00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:25,289
[both chuckle]

369
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:26,900
Credit cards.

370
00:24:26,943 --> 00:24:30,947
Oh, that's good.
I like that, very creative.

371
00:24:30,991 --> 00:24:33,820
Of course, they cut them
off after a while.

372
00:24:33,863 --> 00:24:35,778
Mmm.
I know.

373
00:24:35,822 --> 00:24:39,826
I bet you have some
campaign money left over.

374
00:24:39,869 --> 00:24:41,871
Sorry. Bad joke.

375
00:24:41,915 --> 00:24:43,743
It's all right.

376
00:24:43,786 --> 00:24:45,875
No, really, I'm sorry.
It was just a joke.

377
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:47,573
It was a good one.

378
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:49,662
John...It's clever. Very clever.

379
00:24:49,705 --> 00:24:50,837
All right, stop it.

380
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,316
What?
I admire your quick wit.

381
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,927
I said stop!

382
00:24:57,147 --> 00:24:58,888
Well?
We're stopped.

383
00:24:58,932 --> 00:25:00,324
What now?

384
00:25:00,368 --> 00:25:02,196
That's what
I'd like to know.

385
00:25:02,239 --> 00:25:03,458
Meaning?

386
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,547
Meaning we can't
go on like this.

387
00:25:05,591 --> 00:25:07,331
There was an election.
You lost, it's over.

388
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:09,333
We've got to move
on with our lives.

389
00:25:09,377 --> 00:25:10,726
Just put things
behind us?

390
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:12,206
Yes. Exactly.

391
00:25:12,249 --> 00:25:14,121
I know it's difficult,
but sometimes these things--

392
00:25:14,164 --> 00:25:15,601
These things have
a way of working out.

393
00:25:15,644 --> 00:25:17,820
That's not...Maybe even for the better.

394
00:25:17,864 --> 00:25:19,169
Yes.Oh, good.

395
00:25:19,213 --> 00:25:20,823
Ever since the election,
I've been waiting

396
00:25:20,867 --> 00:25:22,651
to find out why it
was such a good thing

397
00:25:22,695 --> 00:25:25,959
I got my butt handed
to me like that.

398
00:25:26,002 --> 00:25:27,656
Maybe now,
you'll tell me.

399
00:25:30,006 --> 00:25:33,357
Maybe it wasn't good for you,
John, but it was good for us.

400
00:25:33,401 --> 00:25:36,143
Okay.
Go on, you're on a roll.

401
00:25:36,186 --> 00:25:38,580
You haven't noticed the way
we're moving apart?

402
00:25:38,624 --> 00:25:40,669
Did you happen to notice
we were in the middle

403
00:25:40,713 --> 00:25:42,236
of a political campaign?

404
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:43,846
What did you expect?

405
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:45,892
People's attentions
drift off.

406
00:25:45,935 --> 00:25:48,242
We didn't drift, John.

407
00:25:48,285 --> 00:25:51,158
Continents drift.
People move apart.

408
00:25:51,201 --> 00:25:53,639
I want you to be
yourself again.

409
00:25:56,424 --> 00:25:59,558
About whom we've heard
so much lately.

410
00:26:03,866 --> 00:26:07,087
Then maybe we can get
back to who we were.

411
00:26:09,655 --> 00:26:11,526
Well, I guess my sister
was so in love with him

412
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:15,835
that she couldn't even see what
was happening all around her.

413
00:26:15,878 --> 00:26:19,621
Like this pixie dust.

414
00:26:19,665 --> 00:26:25,845
Sprinkle a little love,
and you end up fooling yourself.

415
00:26:28,674 --> 00:26:30,197
Claude.Hmm?

416
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,285
Hey!

417
00:26:31,328 --> 00:26:32,416
John! Kathy!Hi!

418
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,504
Hi.

419
00:26:33,548 --> 00:26:34,941
What a beautiful
day for a walk.

420
00:26:34,984 --> 00:26:37,465
Yes, it is.
We went for a swim and...

421
00:26:37,508 --> 00:26:38,858
Glad you did.

422
00:26:38,901 --> 00:26:40,250
Would you like
some iced tea or--

423
00:26:40,294 --> 00:26:42,122
I'd love some.Johnny.

424
00:26:46,387 --> 00:26:48,345
What's the matter with him?

425
00:26:48,389 --> 00:26:50,260
He's so distant.

426
00:26:50,304 --> 00:26:53,916
I mean, measured in feet,
yards and miles sometimes.

427
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,657
Does he talk
to you about it?

428
00:26:55,701 --> 00:26:57,137
Which "it"?

429
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,356
The election?
Vietnam?

430
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,228
Either.No.

431
00:27:01,271 --> 00:27:03,360
He's been that way
since his father died.

432
00:27:03,404 --> 00:27:04,579
Come sit down.

433
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:07,887
[sighs]

434
00:27:16,983 --> 00:27:18,680
[applause]

435
00:27:18,724 --> 00:27:21,291
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

436
00:27:21,335 --> 00:27:26,470
I am Johnny Waylan,
the man who knows.

437
00:27:26,514 --> 00:27:28,951
Thank you. Thank you.

438
00:27:28,995 --> 00:27:31,519
[applause]

439
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:52,714
[barn door opening]

440
00:27:57,327 --> 00:27:58,764
What are you doing?

441
00:27:58,807 --> 00:28:01,375
I was just...
I just was...

442
00:28:01,418 --> 00:28:04,073
What you better just is
just mind your own business.

443
00:28:11,211 --> 00:28:14,823
It ain't
a perfect world, son.

444
00:28:14,867 --> 00:28:18,653
You got those gizmos,
those tricks.

445
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:21,351
What I got...

446
00:28:21,395 --> 00:28:24,006
Well, everybody's got
his own way.

447
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:26,574
Wouldn't you say
that's about fair?

448
00:28:29,403 --> 00:28:31,231
Dad?

449
00:28:31,274 --> 00:28:34,408
When I get things set up,
will you come see the show?

450
00:28:39,413 --> 00:28:43,199
Show me a politician, and I'll
show you an unhappy childhood.

451
00:28:43,243 --> 00:28:45,332
Same for magicians.

452
00:28:45,375 --> 00:28:48,770
He actually thought
of himself as Sorcerer.

453
00:28:48,814 --> 00:28:50,816
That's how it seemed to me.

454
00:28:50,859 --> 00:28:54,689
Kathy was his
main audience.

455
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,778
I don't know how she
put up with it.

456
00:28:56,822 --> 00:28:58,867
I guess she hoped
that he would pull off

457
00:28:58,911 --> 00:29:00,826
a real miracle some day.

458
00:29:23,849 --> 00:29:27,113
Can I ask you
a question?

459
00:29:27,156 --> 00:29:29,115
Always.

460
00:29:29,158 --> 00:29:33,162
Why didn't you talk
to Claude and Rebecca?

461
00:29:33,206 --> 00:29:36,818
You know the answer
to that.

462
00:29:36,862 --> 00:29:38,994
Well, John, it's been
almost two weeks now.

463
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:40,822
You're gonna have to talk
to somebody sometime.

464
00:29:40,866 --> 00:29:42,215
You may as well
start with them.

465
00:29:42,258 --> 00:29:44,521
They've always been
on your side.

466
00:29:44,565 --> 00:29:46,959
No one's on my side.

467
00:29:52,965 --> 00:29:55,271
What do you want, John?

468
00:29:59,536 --> 00:30:01,625
What do you want
people to say?

469
00:30:01,669 --> 00:30:04,237
Do you want 'em to
say it was nothing?

470
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,282
It was trivial?
Just a little mistake?

471
00:30:06,326 --> 00:30:08,850
They can't do that.

472
00:30:08,894 --> 00:30:11,200
They can put it aside.

473
00:30:11,244 --> 00:30:15,117
They can forget
about it, but...

474
00:30:15,161 --> 00:30:18,207
those that don't, they'll
just drop out of our lives.

475
00:30:18,251 --> 00:30:20,775
And we'll move on.
That's all.

476
00:30:27,173 --> 00:30:28,870
What about you?

477
00:30:32,091 --> 00:30:34,354
Can I?

478
00:30:37,923 --> 00:30:41,448
I don't know.

479
00:30:41,491 --> 00:30:42,928
But I need your help.

480
00:30:42,971 --> 00:30:44,755
I need you to help me
understand.

481
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,454
I just want to be
part of your life.

482
00:30:47,497 --> 00:30:50,109
Don't shut me out.

483
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:23,098
All right, ladies,
that was great.

484
00:31:23,142 --> 00:31:24,708
Thanks a lot.
See you on Thursday.

485
00:31:24,752 --> 00:31:28,016
[applause]

486
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:30,714
Hi. How you doing?
Look, please.

487
00:31:30,758 --> 00:31:32,499
I just want to ask you
a couple of questions, okay?

488
00:31:32,542 --> 00:31:33,935
A couple of
simple questions.

489
00:31:33,979 --> 00:31:35,458
Look, I told you I don't
want to talk to you.

490
00:31:35,502 --> 00:31:36,982
Okay, but you know where
they went, right?

491
00:31:37,025 --> 00:31:38,287
Oh, come on,
you're her sister.

492
00:31:38,331 --> 00:31:39,898
Of course you know
where they went.

493
00:31:39,941 --> 00:31:41,551
Hey, look, I'm not trying
to hurt anybody here.

494
00:31:41,595 --> 00:31:42,944
I'm just trying
to tell a story.

495
00:31:42,988 --> 00:31:44,641
Leave them alone.Hey, he's a public figure.

496
00:31:44,685 --> 00:31:46,121
Yeah, well, not anymore,
thanks to you.

497
00:31:46,165 --> 00:31:47,993
What more do you want?I want what happens after.

498
00:31:48,036 --> 00:31:49,951
Another story.
Maybe even a better one.

499
00:31:49,995 --> 00:31:52,954
Well, that's not a story.
That's an autopsy.

500
00:32:08,317 --> 00:32:10,058
Thank you, thank you.

501
00:32:10,102 --> 00:32:13,192
Silence please.

502
00:32:45,702 --> 00:32:47,487
Where are you going?

503
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:50,446
I'm out of eggs.
I'm gonna run into town.

504
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,498
It's not much of a town.

505
00:32:58,541 --> 00:33:00,500
Could you use
a little company?

506
00:33:00,543 --> 00:33:03,590
You're sure
you want to do this?

507
00:33:03,633 --> 00:33:06,027
"Sooner or later you're
gonna have to face people.

508
00:33:06,071 --> 00:33:08,290
Might as well start
with the eggs."

509
00:33:08,334 --> 00:33:10,901
That's a quote.

510
00:33:10,945 --> 00:33:12,860
More or less.

511
00:33:52,682 --> 00:33:54,858
[Mr. Waylan]
I've spent enough
money on him already!

512
00:33:54,902 --> 00:33:56,730
[Mrs. Waylan]
We have to get him
something, just once.

513
00:33:56,773 --> 00:33:58,471
Can't you do
something for him?

514
00:33:58,514 --> 00:34:00,081
[Mr. Waylan]
He's got enough of
that stupid stuff.

515
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:02,083
What do I have to
give him more for?

516
00:34:02,127 --> 00:34:03,737
[Mrs. Waylan]
Because it's his birthday,
for heaven's sake!

517
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:05,913
[Mr. Waylan]
Don't you take
that tone with me!

518
00:34:05,956 --> 00:34:07,088
He's just trying
to please you.

519
00:34:07,132 --> 00:34:09,699
With what?
Making things disappear?

520
00:34:09,743 --> 00:34:10,874
He's a child.

521
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:12,659
Do you even hear
what you sound like?

522
00:34:12,702 --> 00:34:14,965
[smacking, woman gasping]

523
00:34:15,009 --> 00:34:18,099
[Mr. Waylan]
That'll teach you to
take that tone with me.

524
00:34:59,793 --> 00:35:03,188
Do you want to sit out here
while I order some breakfast?

525
00:35:03,231 --> 00:35:05,190
Sounds great.

526
00:35:06,756 --> 00:35:08,193
Hello?

527
00:35:09,629 --> 00:35:12,327
Hello?

528
00:35:12,371 --> 00:35:13,981
Hi.Hi.

529
00:35:14,024 --> 00:35:15,156
Hi, can we can
order some breakfast

530
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,462
while I pick up
some things?

531
00:35:16,505 --> 00:35:17,767
Whatever you want.

532
00:35:17,811 --> 00:35:20,814
Uh, scrambled eggs,
bacon, toast.

533
00:35:20,857 --> 00:35:22,642
You bet.

534
00:35:58,547 --> 00:36:02,247
Well, they have
the Minneapolis paper.

535
00:36:10,429 --> 00:36:13,083
They wouldn't reveal your
whereabouts at the office.

536
00:36:13,127 --> 00:36:16,304
Apparently, somebody's
trying to interview you.

537
00:36:16,348 --> 00:36:18,176
What do you have to
read that stuff for?

538
00:36:18,219 --> 00:36:19,220
[waitress]
Here we go.

539
00:36:19,264 --> 00:36:21,266
Thank you.

540
00:36:21,309 --> 00:36:22,658
I don't have to read it.

541
00:36:22,702 --> 00:36:24,225
I just think we ought to
know what's going on.

542
00:36:24,269 --> 00:36:26,227
It's not even
front page news anymore.

543
00:36:26,271 --> 00:36:27,272
In another day or two...

544
00:36:27,315 --> 00:36:29,535
It'll all be
forgotten?

545
00:36:29,578 --> 00:36:31,537
Tell me about it then.

546
00:36:34,279 --> 00:36:37,630
They tried to
interview my sister.

547
00:36:40,285 --> 00:36:41,851
If she tells them
where we are...

548
00:36:41,895 --> 00:36:43,636
She wouldn't do that.

549
00:36:46,856 --> 00:36:48,162
[gasps]

550
00:36:59,652 --> 00:37:04,352
Think about Waterloo.
Think about Napoleon.

551
00:37:04,396 --> 00:37:07,877
Life's over.
You're a dead man.

552
00:37:07,921 --> 00:37:11,751
I bet he's still
having nightmares.

553
00:37:11,794 --> 00:37:14,319
I bet he's out there
somewhere swatting flies.

554
00:37:14,362 --> 00:37:17,974
Can we believe that he was
not a monster, but a man?

555
00:37:18,018 --> 00:37:20,977
That he was innocent of
everything except his life?

556
00:37:21,021 --> 00:37:25,286
Can the truth be so simple?
So terrible?

557
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:27,201
[ringing]

558
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:33,773
[Mr. Waylan]
How you doing?

559
00:37:33,816 --> 00:37:36,123
How can I help you?

560
00:37:36,166 --> 00:37:37,864
Oh, it's you.

561
00:37:37,907 --> 00:37:40,083
What are you looking for?It's his birthday.

562
00:37:40,127 --> 00:37:41,868
I told him he could have
whatever he wants.

563
00:37:41,911 --> 00:37:44,131
Isn't that something?
He's a lucky lad.

564
00:37:44,174 --> 00:37:46,481
Yeah, he is.
So, what can you show us?

565
00:37:46,525 --> 00:37:48,744
Birthday. Right.

566
00:37:51,181 --> 00:37:53,532
Did you really mean
anything he wants?

567
00:37:53,575 --> 00:37:55,316
How bad is this
gonna hurt?

568
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,797
Well, it's something
he's wanted for a long time.

569
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,320
You know what I'm talking
about, don't you, Johnny?

570
00:37:59,364 --> 00:38:01,104
Do you?

571
00:38:01,148 --> 00:38:03,933
All right.
Let's have a look.

572
00:38:07,415 --> 00:38:10,244
Oh, thank you.
Over there.

573
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:13,334
Is this what you want?

574
00:38:13,378 --> 00:38:15,031
Yeah!

575
00:38:24,998 --> 00:38:26,216
Okay.

576
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:28,697
Ready?

577
00:38:32,571 --> 00:38:34,094
Yes![chuckles]

578
00:38:36,096 --> 00:38:38,272
Something, isn't it?

579
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:39,795
Johnny, raise the blade.

580
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:41,362
Give me your arm.What?

581
00:38:41,406 --> 00:38:44,539
Your arm.
Trust me.

582
00:38:44,583 --> 00:38:46,976
You have strong arms.

583
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:49,022
Over here.

584
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,592
[clears throat]

585
00:38:53,635 --> 00:38:55,376
Now, you know what to do,
don't you, Johnny?

586
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:56,595
Well, how would he know?

587
00:38:56,638 --> 00:38:59,380
Sure, I do.
It's easy.

588
00:38:59,424 --> 00:39:00,686
Go ahead, Johnny.

589
00:39:00,729 --> 00:39:02,209
Look, he's just a kid.

590
00:39:02,252 --> 00:39:04,429
There's got to be
instructions or something.

591
00:39:12,306 --> 00:39:17,398
He was absolutely terrified.
My father.

592
00:39:20,662 --> 00:39:22,577
And it was the only time
in my life with him

593
00:39:22,621 --> 00:39:24,623
I felt any connection.

594
00:39:24,666 --> 00:39:27,626
And then he was dead.

595
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:32,587
At his funeral I used
to imagine myself

596
00:39:32,631 --> 00:39:36,983
crawling into the casket
with a hammer.

597
00:39:37,026 --> 00:39:40,421
I wanted to kill him
for dying.

598
00:39:43,642 --> 00:39:45,470
[sniffling]

599
00:39:45,513 --> 00:39:49,169
Instead, I used to
pretend he was alive.

600
00:39:52,259 --> 00:39:56,785
I'd lay in my bed at night
in my room, and I'd say,

601
00:39:56,829 --> 00:40:01,268
"Please, don't be dead,"
and he'd be there.

602
00:40:04,097 --> 00:40:06,752
And he'd wink at me and say,

603
00:40:06,795 --> 00:40:10,843
"Well, hey, kiddo,
keep talking."

604
00:40:12,279 --> 00:40:16,936
And we'd talk about
baseball and school.

605
00:40:21,506 --> 00:40:25,553
Even in Vietnam
I used to imagine...

606
00:40:25,597 --> 00:40:30,253
myself coming home
in my uniform,

607
00:40:30,297 --> 00:40:33,648
and I'd get off
the bus, and he'd be there.

608
00:40:33,692 --> 00:40:38,348
And he'd smile at me
and he'd say,

609
00:40:38,392 --> 00:40:42,701
"Good job, son.
I'm proud of you."

610
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,966
But what happened
over there--

611
00:40:47,009 --> 00:40:49,838
What happened over there
had nothing to do with this.

612
00:40:49,882 --> 00:40:51,492
But why would you--

613
00:40:51,536 --> 00:40:53,102
Why what?

614
00:40:53,146 --> 00:40:55,844
You keep looking for reasons.
There are none.

615
00:40:55,888 --> 00:40:57,150
Because something--

616
00:40:57,193 --> 00:40:59,500
Something what?You're not a killer.

617
00:40:59,544 --> 00:41:01,110
Apparently I am!

618
00:41:03,852 --> 00:41:06,725
Why can't you
understand that?

619
00:41:15,777 --> 00:41:18,345
He didn't talk much.

620
00:41:18,388 --> 00:41:20,303
Even his wife,
I mean, I don't think

621
00:41:20,347 --> 00:41:23,437
she knew the first thing
about-- about any of it.

622
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,961
[footsteps approaching]

623
00:42:12,617 --> 00:42:13,922
Hi.

624
00:42:13,966 --> 00:42:16,751
Hi.

625
00:42:16,795 --> 00:42:18,797
How's your sister?

626
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,276
Oh, she's fine.

627
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:24,019
She... she just needed
to talk, that's all.

628
00:42:33,725 --> 00:42:35,727
[wood creaking]

629
00:42:39,208 --> 00:42:40,819
John?

630
00:42:50,524 --> 00:42:53,832
[phone ringing]

631
00:43:24,166 --> 00:43:27,561
I thought you were
coming swimming with me.

632
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:30,956
Why did you, um,
connect the phone?

633
00:43:32,522 --> 00:43:34,133
You know, the water's
really beautiful.

634
00:43:34,176 --> 00:43:36,918
I'm going swimming
later, you might...

635
00:43:36,962 --> 00:43:39,268
Why did you
connect the phone?

636
00:43:39,312 --> 00:43:42,228
Because that's what
telephones are for.

637
00:43:42,271 --> 00:43:44,056
No, I just wanted to
call my sister

638
00:43:44,099 --> 00:43:46,928
and see if those people
were still bothering her.

639
00:43:46,972 --> 00:43:51,672
Then why didn't you disconnect
it when you were finished?

640
00:43:51,716 --> 00:43:54,893
I could have done that,
but I didn't.

641
00:43:54,936 --> 00:43:57,939
Why, did it
hurt you?

642
00:43:57,983 --> 00:44:01,247
Did you pick it up?

643
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:03,858
No?

644
00:44:03,902 --> 00:44:07,122
Well then, I guess it didn't
really bother you, did it?

645
00:44:09,168 --> 00:44:13,476
Kathy was no angel.
There was that affair.

646
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,348
I guess that must have
hurt him pretty bad.

647
00:44:15,391 --> 00:44:19,395
I mean, they were in love.
Honest love.

648
00:44:19,439 --> 00:44:21,049
Just like Claude and me.

649
00:44:21,093 --> 00:44:24,052
He reminds me of that--
that famous onion.

650
00:44:24,096 --> 00:44:27,926
You peel away the layers,
and there's always more there.

651
00:44:29,928 --> 00:44:32,582
We need to talk.
Make some decisions.

652
00:44:32,626 --> 00:44:35,411
What do we want to do?

653
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:37,936
We're doing it.

654
00:44:37,979 --> 00:44:41,330
We can't stay here.
You know that.

655
00:44:41,374 --> 00:44:43,506
I thought you wanted
to stay here forever.

656
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:45,508
That was just talk.

657
00:44:45,552 --> 00:44:47,423
What's this?

658
00:44:54,474 --> 00:44:55,736
[sighs]

659
00:45:02,612 --> 00:45:04,527
Okay, what do you want?

660
00:45:04,571 --> 00:45:06,747
I just want
our lives back.

661
00:45:06,791 --> 00:45:08,531
I mean, no one's
prosecuting you, John.

662
00:45:08,575 --> 00:45:10,011
We don't have to hide
out in these woods

663
00:45:10,055 --> 00:45:12,797
like a couple
of fugitives.

664
00:45:14,015 --> 00:45:16,365
No more hiding?
Is that what you want?

665
00:45:16,409 --> 00:45:18,454
No more secrets, everything
out in the open?

666
00:45:18,498 --> 00:45:20,718
Yes.Fine.

667
00:45:23,372 --> 00:45:26,245
[John]
We were on patrol in the brush.

668
00:45:30,815 --> 00:45:32,599
Someone tripped a mine.

669
00:45:39,519 --> 00:45:40,476
Take a hit!

670
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:41,651
Come on!

671
00:45:41,695 --> 00:45:42,870
[John]
Three of us were hurt.

672
00:45:42,914 --> 00:45:44,176
Come on!

673
00:45:44,219 --> 00:45:46,352
There wasn't anything
I could do.

674
00:45:46,395 --> 00:45:48,528
There was no
magic dust this time.

675
00:45:51,836 --> 00:45:56,188
There was just terror.
Months of terror.

676
00:45:56,231 --> 00:45:59,669
Months of slaughter.

677
00:45:59,713 --> 00:46:02,020
And then something snapped.

678
00:46:08,722 --> 00:46:11,116
There was a village.

679
00:46:11,159 --> 00:46:12,857
We all knew it was
full of civilians.

680
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:14,467
I don't think
I can hear this.

681
00:46:16,034 --> 00:46:18,688
Isn't this what you wanted?
The truth?

682
00:46:21,039 --> 00:46:23,519
[gunfire continues]

683
00:46:25,434 --> 00:46:29,047
[John]
We killed everything that moved.

684
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,008
[woman screaming]

685
00:46:34,052 --> 00:46:36,054
Scums!

686
00:46:40,928 --> 00:46:42,887
Get up! Come on!
Get up! Shoo!

687
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:45,846
Git! Git!

688
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:50,068
Come on, get up!
Get up, you piece of filth.

689
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:51,330
[gunfire]

690
00:46:58,511 --> 00:47:00,774
[John]
So many of our men had died.

691
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:03,864
We wanted to
kill something.

692
00:47:03,908 --> 00:47:08,042
We had to kill something.
It didn't matter what.

693
00:47:08,086 --> 00:47:11,567
Animals,
old people, children.

694
00:47:11,611 --> 00:47:14,048
It went on forever.

695
00:47:14,092 --> 00:47:16,877
Man, which side are you on, man?
Come on!

696
00:47:16,921 --> 00:47:20,489
[John]
All the bodies
just became one body.

697
00:47:20,533 --> 00:47:22,883
[gunfire, explosions continue]

698
00:47:37,942 --> 00:47:41,597
The war would have got 'em
them sooner or later.

699
00:47:41,641 --> 00:47:44,339
We just made it sooner.

700
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:46,211
But you weren't shooting.

701
00:47:46,254 --> 00:47:48,909
Oh, it doesn't matter.

702
00:47:48,953 --> 00:47:50,476
You weren't shooting.

703
00:47:50,519 --> 00:47:52,739
I was there!
Don't you understand that?

704
00:47:52,782 --> 00:47:55,002
But you didn't shoot!

705
00:47:55,046 --> 00:47:56,917
I was there!

706
00:47:56,961 --> 00:48:01,182
Kathy, I'm part of it.
Don't you understand?

707
00:48:01,226 --> 00:48:03,010
Stop it!

708
00:48:03,054 --> 00:48:05,578
Oh, Kathy!

709
00:48:05,621 --> 00:48:07,623
Kathy!

710
00:48:15,066 --> 00:48:16,894
Kathy!

711
00:49:42,414 --> 00:49:44,459
[Thinbill]
My mind just went.
I just killed.

712
00:49:44,503 --> 00:49:48,594
I just killed
any way I could kill.

713
00:49:48,637 --> 00:49:51,031
It just came.

714
00:49:51,075 --> 00:49:53,599
I didn't know
I had it in me, sir.

715
00:49:53,642 --> 00:49:55,557
[man]
What were your orders?

716
00:49:58,343 --> 00:50:00,040
Kill everything
that breathed.

717
00:50:00,084 --> 00:50:01,824
And the troops
on your right and left?

718
00:50:01,868 --> 00:50:03,609
They were obeying
these orders?

719
00:50:03,652 --> 00:50:08,527
Yes, sir.
Everyone was firing, sir.

720
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:11,443
Eyeballs for eyeballs, sir.

721
00:50:11,486 --> 00:50:14,446
That's one of your famous
Bible regulations.

722
00:50:14,489 --> 00:50:17,231
Kill the 'Nam, kill it.

723
00:50:17,275 --> 00:50:19,277
Grease the place.

724
00:50:21,453 --> 00:50:23,063
Kill it.

725
00:51:40,836 --> 00:51:43,361
[teapot whistling]

726
00:52:20,224 --> 00:52:22,269
Wow.

727
00:53:53,578 --> 00:53:55,580
Kathy?

728
00:53:58,670 --> 00:54:00,498
Kath?

729
00:54:05,894 --> 00:54:09,158
Kath, you up yet?

730
00:54:27,176 --> 00:54:29,135
Kathy?

731
00:54:31,006 --> 00:54:33,052
Kathy?

732
00:54:36,403 --> 00:54:38,449
Kathy?

733
00:54:42,061 --> 00:54:44,019
Kathy?

734
00:54:45,194 --> 00:54:47,153
Kathy!

735
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:54,552
Kathy!

736
00:54:54,595 --> 00:54:57,250
The guy was a magic man.
He could fool people.

737
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:59,034
He sure fooled me.

738
00:54:59,078 --> 00:55:01,341
Keeping all that
stuff inside.

739
00:55:01,385 --> 00:55:03,169
It must have
driven him crazy.

740
00:55:03,212 --> 00:55:06,912
I think my sister was
almost scared of him.

741
00:55:06,955 --> 00:55:10,089
I remember this
one time when Kathy...

742
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:14,441
Uh, no, I don't think
this is something

743
00:55:14,485 --> 00:55:16,356
that we should talk about.

744
00:55:37,421 --> 00:55:39,988
[sighs]

745
00:55:47,431 --> 00:55:53,219
[John]
Taxi!

746
00:55:53,262 --> 00:55:54,786
[driver]
Just back from 'Nam, huh?

747
00:55:54,829 --> 00:55:57,136
I seen it on your chest.

748
00:56:00,008 --> 00:56:02,402
Just want you to know,
there's plenty of people here

749
00:56:02,446 --> 00:56:05,579
proud of what you guys
are doing.

750
00:56:05,623 --> 00:56:07,015
I've got something for you.

751
00:56:07,059 --> 00:56:10,018
But first, I've got to
tell you a story.

752
00:56:10,062 --> 00:56:12,281
One day we were on patrol,

753
00:56:12,325 --> 00:56:15,807
and I saw something
moving on the trail.

754
00:56:15,850 --> 00:56:18,897
There were two snakes
lying on the ground,

755
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:22,422
and they were eating
each other's tail.

756
00:56:22,466 --> 00:56:25,207
They were trying to
swallow each other up.

757
00:56:25,251 --> 00:56:27,601
And I thought about us.

758
00:56:27,645 --> 00:56:31,779
And then one day
I was in Saigon,

759
00:56:31,823 --> 00:56:35,653
and I met this guy who
makes things out of jade,

760
00:56:35,696 --> 00:56:37,698
and I told him the story.

761
00:56:37,742 --> 00:56:41,006
I remember it was...
it was...

762
00:56:41,049 --> 00:56:45,445
it was raining like crazy.

763
00:56:49,275 --> 00:56:51,146
Do you like it?

764
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:52,713
It's beautiful.

765
00:56:52,757 --> 00:56:55,760
I love you, Kath.

766
00:56:55,803 --> 00:56:58,458
Just like those
weirdo snakes.

767
00:57:06,118 --> 00:57:08,468
It's a vision
of perfection.

768
00:57:08,512 --> 00:57:10,862
The circle gets
smaller and smaller

769
00:57:10,905 --> 00:57:12,341
as they devour
each other.

770
00:57:12,385 --> 00:57:15,170
Which one's left?

771
00:57:15,214 --> 00:57:17,042
Neither.

772
00:57:17,085 --> 00:57:19,044
Did you have a fight?No, nothing like that.

773
00:57:19,087 --> 00:57:20,611
Did she tell you where
she was going?No.

774
00:57:20,654 --> 00:57:22,047
Did she do anything
like this before?

775
00:57:22,090 --> 00:57:23,527
Sometimes.She did?

776
00:57:23,570 --> 00:57:25,790
Sometimes she needed
her own space.

777
00:57:25,833 --> 00:57:29,402
She'd go off to her sister's
or to a friend's, or...

778
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:31,883
Something's happened to her.

779
00:57:33,319 --> 00:57:36,409
People run out of gas,
lose an engine,

780
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:37,671
all kinds of nutty stuff.

781
00:57:37,715 --> 00:57:39,281
It happens
more than you think.

782
00:57:39,325 --> 00:57:41,675
Kathy had her own history.

783
00:57:41,719 --> 00:57:44,112
That affair of hers,

784
00:57:44,156 --> 00:57:48,552
the way she used to take off
now and then.

785
00:57:48,595 --> 00:57:50,510
I remember once
during the campaign

786
00:57:50,554 --> 00:57:52,599
we had a conversation
about how sometimes

787
00:57:52,643 --> 00:57:56,342
you need to
sort of unstick yourself.

788
00:57:56,385 --> 00:57:57,865
Maybe she finally did it.

789
00:58:02,566 --> 00:58:04,524
Okay, now, let's start
at the beginning.

790
00:58:04,568 --> 00:58:07,222
When did you first
notice that she was gone?

791
00:58:07,266 --> 00:58:09,007
This morning.
I went for a swim.

792
00:58:09,050 --> 00:58:10,269
What time was that?

793
00:58:10,312 --> 00:58:11,531
It was very early.

794
00:58:13,881 --> 00:58:17,929
I don't understand.
Where is she?

795
00:58:17,972 --> 00:58:19,670
Let's call the sheriff.

796
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:26,198
Johnny, where's the phone?

797
00:58:26,241 --> 00:58:28,200
Oh...

798
00:58:28,243 --> 00:58:29,810
I'm sorry.

799
00:58:42,388 --> 00:58:45,957
Operator?
Sheriff Lux, please.

800
00:58:53,791 --> 00:58:55,880
All right, what kind of
problem we got here?

801
00:58:55,923 --> 00:58:57,838
Art, good of you to come.

802
00:58:57,882 --> 00:58:59,013
Claude.Vinny.

803
00:58:59,057 --> 00:59:00,362
Hi.

804
00:59:00,406 --> 00:59:01,581
Vinny Pearson.

805
00:59:01,625 --> 00:59:03,061
Hello.Art Lux.

806
00:59:03,104 --> 00:59:04,192
Art's the sheriff here.

807
00:59:04,236 --> 00:59:05,454
Sheriff.

808
00:59:05,498 --> 00:59:07,935
Vinny's his deputy.
John Waylan.

809
00:59:07,979 --> 00:59:09,589
John and his wife Kathy

810
00:59:09,633 --> 00:59:11,286
are guests of mine
at the cottage here.

811
00:59:11,330 --> 00:59:13,941
As I told you,
Kathy seems to be missing.

812
00:59:13,985 --> 00:59:16,378
Right, yesterday morning?
That what you said?

813
00:59:16,422 --> 00:59:19,381
Yes, that's when
I noticed she was gone.

814
00:59:19,425 --> 00:59:21,383
Right.
[sniffing]

815
00:59:21,427 --> 00:59:22,602
That your car back there?

816
00:59:22,646 --> 00:59:24,169
Yes, it is.

817
00:59:24,212 --> 00:59:25,692
Well, then,
she's not driving.

818
00:59:28,521 --> 00:59:30,871
How 'bout a boat?

819
00:59:30,915 --> 00:59:32,830
Well, she wouldn't have
known how to use it.

820
00:59:32,873 --> 00:59:34,353
Then you do own a boat.

821
00:59:34,396 --> 00:59:36,311
It's my boat, I told them
they could use it.

822
00:59:36,355 --> 00:59:37,530
And it's still here?

823
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:39,053
It must be.

824
00:59:39,097 --> 00:59:40,446
Can we have a look?

825
00:59:56,114 --> 00:59:57,768
We keep the...

826
01:00:01,075 --> 01:00:03,643
I don't understand.

827
01:00:03,687 --> 01:00:07,038
She must have thought
she could handle it.

828
01:00:07,081 --> 01:00:10,824
Or else she wanted to
get out of here real bad.

829
01:00:10,868 --> 01:00:14,349
Okay, so she
took the boat.

830
01:00:14,393 --> 01:00:17,831
What do we do now, Art?

831
01:00:17,875 --> 01:00:20,007
Let's get back to the house.
I'll make some calls.

832
01:00:20,051 --> 01:00:22,227
Okay.

833
01:00:22,270 --> 01:00:23,663
You known this guy
very long?

834
01:00:23,707 --> 01:00:24,882
Yeah, a long time.

835
01:00:24,925 --> 01:00:26,971
Sorry about the election,
Mr. Waylan.

836
01:00:27,014 --> 01:00:29,016
Voted for you myself,
not that it matters.

837
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:30,975
Big "X" right by your name.

838
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:34,892
Well, the weather
looks like it's holding.

839
01:00:34,935 --> 01:00:37,285
It's a young woman
in good health.

840
01:00:37,329 --> 01:00:38,678
That right, Mr. Waylan?

841
01:00:38,722 --> 01:00:41,855
Yes, she's in
good health.

842
01:00:41,899 --> 01:00:43,944
What was she wearing?

843
01:00:43,988 --> 01:00:47,165
Uh, she was asleep,
in her pajamas.

844
01:00:47,208 --> 01:00:48,819
Pajamas?

845
01:00:48,862 --> 01:00:51,082
Or she may have taken
something else, I don't know.

846
01:00:51,125 --> 01:00:53,301
I'd have to go through
her closet.

847
01:00:53,345 --> 01:00:55,260
She was in pajamas.

848
01:00:55,303 --> 01:01:00,744
Just put it out
that way.

849
01:01:00,787 --> 01:01:02,354
Well, that should be okay.

850
01:01:02,397 --> 01:01:03,877
Get lucky,
find her tonight.

851
01:01:03,921 --> 01:01:06,880
If not...If not, what?

852
01:01:06,924 --> 01:01:08,795
Find her tomorrow.

853
01:01:14,627 --> 01:01:16,150
Getting a search up,
and I had Lois

854
01:01:16,194 --> 01:01:17,586
put in a call
to the colonel.

855
01:01:17,630 --> 01:01:19,153
You gonna get your boat
or come in mine?

856
01:01:19,197 --> 01:01:20,720
No, I'll take my own.

857
01:01:20,764 --> 01:01:22,330
Between the regulars
and the volunteers,

858
01:01:22,374 --> 01:01:24,158
could be we'll have
100 boats out on the water.

859
01:01:24,202 --> 01:01:25,812
I wouldn't worry too much
if I were you.

860
01:01:25,856 --> 01:01:27,292
I appreciate that.

861
01:01:27,335 --> 01:01:29,120
Could be she just took
her out for a ride.

862
01:01:29,163 --> 01:01:30,904
Million coves, you know.

863
01:01:30,948 --> 01:01:34,299
Dozens of islands,
382 miles of coast.

864
01:01:34,342 --> 01:01:36,040
You'd be surprised
how easy it is

865
01:01:36,083 --> 01:01:37,519
to get lost
out on the water.

866
01:01:37,563 --> 01:01:39,043
I suppose so.

867
01:01:39,086 --> 01:01:42,176
I can't thank you
enough, really.

868
01:01:42,220 --> 01:01:43,525
You know,
down in Minneapolis,

869
01:01:43,569 --> 01:01:45,658
you're a very important man,
Mr. Waylan.

870
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:48,530
I wouldn't say that,
not any more.

871
01:01:48,574 --> 01:01:49,749
Fact is fact.

872
01:01:49,793 --> 01:01:51,620
And up here,
I'm just a hick sheriff.

873
01:01:51,664 --> 01:01:53,535
And Vinny, he's just
a part-time deputy.

874
01:01:53,579 --> 01:01:55,189
Couple of rubes for sure.

875
01:01:55,233 --> 01:01:56,974
But I'll tell you
one thing.

876
01:01:57,017 --> 01:01:58,540
We'll find that
little lady of yours,

877
01:01:58,584 --> 01:02:00,325
you can go to sleep on that.

878
01:02:00,368 --> 01:02:02,675
Guaranteed in gold
we'll find her.

879
01:02:04,895 --> 01:02:08,594
Uh, according to Claude,
your phone wasn't hooked up.

880
01:02:08,637 --> 01:02:10,248
Yes, that's right.

881
01:02:10,291 --> 01:02:12,772
Any particular
reason why not?

882
01:02:12,816 --> 01:02:15,209
Well, we came up here
to get away.

883
01:02:15,253 --> 01:02:16,558
I just lost an election.

884
01:02:16,602 --> 01:02:18,430
I didn't want to get
any calls.

885
01:02:18,473 --> 01:02:20,258
The way you lost it,
Senator, I wouldn't think

886
01:02:20,301 --> 01:02:21,999
you'd be getting
all that many.

887
01:02:22,042 --> 01:02:23,783
I wouldn't let Vinny bother
you too much, Mr. Waylan.

888
01:02:23,827 --> 01:02:26,568
It's just his way.
Another 'Nam type.

889
01:02:26,612 --> 01:02:28,266
You know what I mean?

890
01:02:28,309 --> 01:02:29,702
That so?

891
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:32,574
Yeah, but I didn't
kill any babies.

892
01:02:32,618 --> 01:02:35,795
[clicks tongue]
That's good.

893
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:38,015
I always like
that in a man.

894
01:02:41,627 --> 01:02:43,498
Ah, that phone thing
bothers me, Sheriff.

895
01:02:43,542 --> 01:02:45,370
Yeah?I don't know.

896
01:02:45,413 --> 01:02:46,719
A man's worried about
his wife, you'd think

897
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:49,243
he'd hook it up in case
she called, right?

898
01:02:52,420 --> 01:02:54,858
[siren sounding]

899
01:03:01,908 --> 01:03:04,432
[train whistle blowing]

900
01:03:10,743 --> 01:03:12,397
What can I do
for you, sir?

901
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:14,181
Can you fill it up?

902
01:03:18,577 --> 01:03:21,841
Hey, can you tell me where
I can find Vinny Pearson?

903
01:03:21,885 --> 01:03:24,191
You're talking to him.

904
01:03:24,235 --> 01:03:26,890
She just ordered breakfast.
He didn't say a word.

905
01:03:26,933 --> 01:03:29,066
No good morning,
nothing.

906
01:03:29,109 --> 01:03:31,155
Scrambled eggs.

907
01:03:31,198 --> 01:03:33,026
His wife?

908
01:03:33,070 --> 01:03:35,463
If that's who
she was, yeah.

909
01:03:38,684 --> 01:03:41,643
She's over there,
she gets some eggs,

910
01:03:41,687 --> 01:03:44,690
you know, some canned stuff,
and the paper.

911
01:03:44,733 --> 01:03:47,127
She sits down,
she's reading the paper.

912
01:03:47,171 --> 01:03:49,869
He's boiling, you know,
I can see that from here.

913
01:03:49,913 --> 01:03:52,437
All of a sudden
he grabs the paper,

914
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:54,613
he just rips it out
of her hands.

915
01:03:57,181 --> 01:04:01,272
They don't say another word
the whole time they're here.

916
01:04:01,315 --> 01:04:05,145
It was like they were
a million miles apart.

917
01:04:05,189 --> 01:04:07,887
Kind of gave me the shivers,
if you know what I mean.

918
01:04:07,931 --> 01:04:09,802
Well, one thing
you should keep in mind.

919
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:12,457
Case like this, it's not
all that unusual.

920
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:15,677
We run into it, oh,
six, seven times a year.

921
01:04:15,721 --> 01:04:17,810
There was something wrong
with that guy.

922
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:19,507
I could almost smell it.

923
01:04:41,051 --> 01:04:44,402
Oh, man.

924
01:04:44,445 --> 01:04:46,230
They said there weren't
gonna be no civilians.

925
01:04:46,273 --> 01:04:48,754
Didn't they say that?
No civilians?

926
01:04:48,797 --> 01:04:50,799
They said that.

927
01:04:50,843 --> 01:04:53,541
I guess they were
Communists.

928
01:04:53,585 --> 01:04:57,241
What do you think?

929
01:04:57,284 --> 01:04:59,417
Probably.

930
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:03,769
Look, maybe we should...

931
01:05:03,812 --> 01:05:05,553
I don't know.

932
01:05:05,597 --> 01:05:09,818
Like, maybe we should
do something.

933
01:05:09,862 --> 01:05:11,516
What?

934
01:05:11,559 --> 01:05:15,346
You know... report it.

935
01:05:16,564 --> 01:05:20,177
Tell somebody.
Talk.

936
01:05:23,006 --> 01:05:24,833
And then what?

937
01:05:27,575 --> 01:05:29,577
Hmm?

938
01:05:55,038 --> 01:05:56,604
[whispering]
Go away.

939
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:07,311
Go away!

940
01:06:12,055 --> 01:06:13,578
[sighs]

941
01:06:13,621 --> 01:06:17,408
Sorcerer-- man, the guy
had a million moves.

942
01:06:17,451 --> 01:06:19,888
All the lieutenant has to
say is a few magic words,

943
01:06:19,932 --> 01:06:23,022
and the whole
village disappears.

944
01:06:23,066 --> 01:06:25,851
Now, that's magic.
[laughing]

945
01:06:51,703 --> 01:06:56,621
Maybe she ran off with
her lover, or some other guy.

946
01:06:56,664 --> 01:06:58,666
But it wasn't love.

947
01:06:58,710 --> 01:07:00,146
And it wasn't
infatuation either.

948
01:07:00,190 --> 01:07:02,453
I think maybe she just
needed to break away.

949
01:07:02,496 --> 01:07:05,021
[John shouting indistinctly]

950
01:07:06,805 --> 01:07:10,417
[John]
You could have lied.

951
01:07:10,461 --> 01:07:11,984
Hey, kiddo,
you did good.

952
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:14,160
You could have lied.
I did!

953
01:07:22,386 --> 01:07:26,912
My dreams.
My dreams!

954
01:07:26,955 --> 01:07:29,001
My dreams.

955
01:07:35,790 --> 01:07:37,792
Ladies and gentlemen...

956
01:07:37,836 --> 01:07:41,666
hook yourself up
to forever.

957
01:07:41,709 --> 01:07:45,148
You don't
explain a thing.

958
01:07:45,191 --> 01:07:48,281
No notes. No diagrams.

959
01:07:48,325 --> 01:07:49,978
That's the magic.

960
01:07:50,022 --> 01:07:55,419
Dark secrets.
Absolute evil.

961
01:07:55,462 --> 01:07:57,595
Lies!

962
01:07:59,336 --> 01:08:00,946
Lies.

963
01:08:02,165 --> 01:08:05,124
I tasted defeat.

964
01:08:05,168 --> 01:08:08,910
It tastes like
poison politics.

965
01:08:08,954 --> 01:08:11,957
St. Paul and Minneapolis,
gone.

966
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:16,918
The suburbs, gone.
The unions, gone.

967
01:08:16,962 --> 01:08:19,704
Ambush politics.

968
01:08:19,747 --> 01:08:24,535
No bodies...

969
01:08:24,578 --> 01:08:27,451
No numbers.

970
01:08:37,591 --> 01:08:41,726
Twenty years of love...

971
01:08:41,769 --> 01:08:44,598
dissolving...

972
01:08:44,642 --> 01:08:49,037
like tissue.

973
01:08:49,081 --> 01:08:52,519
One plus one...

974
01:08:52,563 --> 01:08:54,826
equals...

975
01:08:54,869 --> 01:08:56,828
[teapot whistling]
...neither.

976
01:08:56,871 --> 01:09:00,614
[whistling continues]

977
01:09:40,263 --> 01:09:43,004
In the rain I would
dream about you,

978
01:09:43,048 --> 01:09:46,225
how much I needed you.

979
01:09:46,269 --> 01:09:51,404
I wanted to crawl inside you,
stay there forever.

980
01:09:51,448 --> 01:09:53,667
Oh, yeah.

981
01:10:39,322 --> 01:10:42,368
[boat starting up]

982
01:10:47,808 --> 01:10:50,681
Kathy said he used to
yell things in his sleep.

983
01:10:50,724 --> 01:10:53,161
Bad things.

984
01:10:53,205 --> 01:10:54,946
She thought he needed help.

985
01:10:54,989 --> 01:10:57,470
Well, whatever happened between
them on the night in question,

986
01:10:57,514 --> 01:10:58,776
things just weren't right.

987
01:10:58,819 --> 01:11:00,908
All that Sorcerer crap.

988
01:11:00,952 --> 01:11:05,130
Look, a guy makes up a name
for himself, you gotta wonder.

989
01:11:05,173 --> 01:11:07,698
I mean, like he didn't even
know who he was.

990
01:11:07,741 --> 01:11:10,091
Vinny's right,
some things just don't add up.

991
01:11:10,135 --> 01:11:12,180
I don't care what Waylan says.

992
01:11:12,224 --> 01:11:15,706
One plus one don't ever
equal zero, not in my book.

993
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:24,410
[banging,
Kathy screaming]

994
01:11:27,805 --> 01:11:30,329
[heartbeat pounding]

995
01:11:35,595 --> 01:11:37,641
I don't know.

996
01:11:37,684 --> 01:11:40,600
I keep imagining these horrible
things have happened to her.

997
01:11:40,644 --> 01:11:42,472
Maybe she left
the boat somewhere

998
01:11:42,515 --> 01:11:44,300
and made it for the road.

999
01:11:44,343 --> 01:11:46,824
It could be she'll call us from
Minneapolis when she's ready.

1000
01:11:46,867 --> 01:11:49,435
They'll find her,
or she'll call.

1001
01:11:49,479 --> 01:11:51,655
It's got to be
one of those two.

1002
01:11:51,698 --> 01:11:55,049
Did she ever say
anything about leaving?

1003
01:11:58,966 --> 01:12:01,839
Not in words exactly.

1004
01:12:07,410 --> 01:12:10,369
Apparently ever since
the campaign,

1005
01:12:10,413 --> 01:12:13,372
even before that,
she felt we were...

1006
01:12:18,290 --> 01:12:20,074
[sighs]

1007
01:12:20,118 --> 01:12:22,163
She was glad when
I lost the election.

1008
01:12:22,207 --> 01:12:23,774
She felt things
would be better

1009
01:12:23,817 --> 01:12:26,254
with politics
out of my life.

1010
01:12:26,298 --> 01:12:27,778
Were they?

1011
01:12:27,821 --> 01:12:31,651
How could they be?
We're the same people.

1012
01:12:32,957 --> 01:12:35,655
John, those stories
about Vietnam.

1013
01:12:35,699 --> 01:12:37,353
Did Kathy know
anything about that?

1014
01:12:40,486 --> 01:12:45,883
I tried to tell her
the night before she left.

1015
01:12:47,754 --> 01:12:49,495
She ran away.

1016
01:12:49,539 --> 01:12:52,759
But she came back.

1017
01:12:52,803 --> 01:12:55,545
I guess so.

1018
01:12:57,938 --> 01:12:59,766
That deputy, Vinny.

1019
01:12:59,810 --> 01:13:01,202
Yeah?

1020
01:13:01,246 --> 01:13:03,335
He thinks
I killed her.

1021
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:05,598
Do you?

1022
01:13:05,642 --> 01:13:07,992
Does it matter
what we think?

1023
01:13:08,035 --> 01:13:09,863
Yes.

1024
01:13:47,074 --> 01:13:48,685
You're good.

1025
01:13:59,609 --> 01:14:03,047
Okay.
There you go.

1026
01:14:03,090 --> 01:14:04,788
Give me your hands.

1027
01:14:08,531 --> 01:14:09,836
Hello, Pat.

1028
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:12,491
Nothing?No, nothing.

1029
01:14:12,535 --> 01:14:13,840
You should have called me

1030
01:14:13,884 --> 01:14:15,363
instead of letting me
hear it on the news.

1031
01:14:15,407 --> 01:14:17,104
I thought she'd be back.

1032
01:14:17,148 --> 01:14:18,715
Do you have a bag
or something?

1033
01:14:18,758 --> 01:14:20,499
No, I didn't think,
I just ran to the airport

1034
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:22,370
as soon as I heard.

1035
01:14:24,155 --> 01:14:26,505
Sheriff, this is
Kathy's sister,

1036
01:14:26,549 --> 01:14:27,767
Patricia Hood.
Sheriff Lux.

1037
01:14:27,811 --> 01:14:29,595
Hi.How do you do?

1038
01:14:29,639 --> 01:14:32,685
I don't know, it just
doesn't make any sense.

1039
01:14:32,729 --> 01:14:33,904
I don't get it.

1040
01:14:33,947 --> 01:14:35,601
Get it?

1041
01:14:35,645 --> 01:14:38,299
Well, she just left,
in a boat.

1042
01:14:38,343 --> 01:14:40,084
Where was she going?

1043
01:14:40,127 --> 01:14:42,782
Any thoughts on that,
Mr. Waylan?

1044
01:14:42,826 --> 01:14:45,524
Into town, I guess.

1045
01:14:45,568 --> 01:14:48,005
I don't know,
maybe she went for a ride.

1046
01:14:48,048 --> 01:14:49,876
A ride?

1047
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:51,443
Maybe.

1048
01:14:53,358 --> 01:14:54,751
For no reason?

1049
01:14:55,926 --> 01:14:57,405
She didn't
need a reason.

1050
01:14:57,449 --> 01:14:59,799
Sometimes she took off.

1051
01:14:59,843 --> 01:15:01,322
For no reason?

1052
01:15:01,366 --> 01:15:04,500
No, she had reasons.
Way too many.

1053
01:15:22,387 --> 01:15:24,302
You know, she was
having an affair.

1054
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:29,394
It meant nothing.

1055
01:15:29,437 --> 01:15:33,006
It didn't feel
like nothing.

1056
01:15:33,050 --> 01:15:35,182
Is that why
you killed her?

1057
01:15:37,663 --> 01:15:39,578
Well, aren't you
gonna deny it?

1058
01:15:42,059 --> 01:15:44,757
Would you believe me?

1059
01:15:44,801 --> 01:15:46,585
No.

1060
01:15:49,414 --> 01:15:51,503
I didn't kill her, Pat.

1061
01:15:53,636 --> 01:15:56,508
I loved her.

1062
01:15:58,466 --> 01:16:02,427
There's not much here.
Kitchen, living room and...

1063
01:16:02,470 --> 01:16:04,951
Why don't you take
our bedroom?

1064
01:16:04,995 --> 01:16:06,387
I'll be back.

1065
01:16:06,431 --> 01:16:08,433
Wait, where are you going?The search.

1066
01:16:10,653 --> 01:16:15,614
When she said
she was going to visit you,

1067
01:16:15,658 --> 01:16:17,442
that was really to see him,
wasn't it?

1068
01:16:17,485 --> 01:16:19,879
What do you
want to know, John?

1069
01:16:19,923 --> 01:16:21,794
The guy was a walking
panic button.

1070
01:16:21,838 --> 01:16:24,971
Just something
to wake you up.

1071
01:16:25,015 --> 01:16:26,538
She just wanted you
to stop her.

1072
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:28,540
Why didn't you?

1073
01:16:30,063 --> 01:16:32,544
I was never much good
at stopping things.

1074
01:16:40,291 --> 01:16:42,772
[boat motor sputtering]

1075
01:17:49,142 --> 01:17:51,536
[knocking]

1076
01:17:52,929 --> 01:17:55,583
[knocking,
door opening]

1077
01:17:55,627 --> 01:17:57,324
Miss Hood?

1078
01:17:57,368 --> 01:17:58,499
Sheriff.

1079
01:17:58,543 --> 01:18:00,240
Can we come in?

1080
01:18:03,766 --> 01:18:05,724
We'd like to look
around a bit.

1081
01:18:05,768 --> 01:18:07,204
Oh.

1082
01:18:07,247 --> 01:18:08,596
You're not gonna have
a problem with that, are you?

1083
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:10,511
No.

1084
01:18:10,555 --> 01:18:11,991
No, not at all.
Please.

1085
01:18:36,973 --> 01:18:38,975
Kathy?

1086
01:18:44,197 --> 01:18:46,809
I'm sorry, John,
I wasn't thinking.

1087
01:18:46,852 --> 01:18:49,115
I didn't have anything
to wear, so...

1088
01:18:49,159 --> 01:18:50,987
[sighs]

1089
01:18:54,251 --> 01:18:56,775
It bothers you,
doesn't it?

1090
01:18:56,819 --> 01:18:58,908
I can go put on
what I was wearing.

1091
01:19:07,612 --> 01:19:10,180
The National Guard's
sending in infrared scanners,

1092
01:19:10,223 --> 01:19:13,357
but... I don't think
they're going to work.

1093
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:15,794
Why not?

1094
01:19:15,838 --> 01:19:19,363
They detect
body warmth.

1095
01:19:19,406 --> 01:19:21,539
It's been three days.

1096
01:19:25,412 --> 01:19:27,501
[John sighs]

1097
01:19:30,069 --> 01:19:33,725
What happened maybe
is that Kathy drowned.

1098
01:19:33,769 --> 01:19:35,292
Something freakish--

1099
01:19:35,335 --> 01:19:37,642
boating accident,
maybe a sandbar.

1100
01:19:37,685 --> 01:19:40,601
There's a million
possibilities, Claude.

1101
01:19:40,645 --> 01:19:42,168
So, you think she's dead?

1102
01:19:42,212 --> 01:19:43,691
No.

1103
01:19:43,735 --> 01:19:46,999
I don't see why everybody
always assumes the worst.

1104
01:19:47,043 --> 01:19:49,001
Sometimes people just
up and walk away.

1105
01:19:49,045 --> 01:19:50,786
That's possible, isn't it?

1106
01:19:50,829 --> 01:19:52,004
If it was an accident,

1107
01:19:52,048 --> 01:19:53,484
her body would
have come up.

1108
01:19:53,527 --> 01:19:56,835
We looked every single
place there was to look.

1109
01:19:56,879 --> 01:19:59,185
We had more than
200 boats out there,

1110
01:19:59,229 --> 01:20:00,447
planes, helicopters,

1111
01:20:00,491 --> 01:20:02,319
sniffer dogs.

1112
01:20:02,362 --> 01:20:04,538
We even brought in
the National Guard.

1113
01:20:04,582 --> 01:20:07,019
No luck.

1114
01:20:07,063 --> 01:20:08,847
If she was setting fires,
we would have found her.

1115
01:20:08,891 --> 01:20:10,457
If she wasn't,
she wouldn't have lasted

1116
01:20:10,501 --> 01:20:11,632
six days in those woods.

1117
01:20:11,676 --> 01:20:13,460
She didn't just vanish.

1118
01:20:13,504 --> 01:20:17,116
The only place we haven't looked
is at the bottom of the lake.

1119
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:19,597
That's where the boat is,
that's where she is.

1120
01:20:21,468 --> 01:20:23,253
No, thanks.

1121
01:20:31,696 --> 01:20:34,133
[dialing]

1122
01:20:35,918 --> 01:20:37,049
[phone ringing]

1123
01:20:37,093 --> 01:20:38,137
[John] Hello?

1124
01:20:38,181 --> 01:20:41,271
Mr. Waylan?
Sheriff Lux.

1125
01:20:41,314 --> 01:20:42,881
We're all here at
the command post,

1126
01:20:42,925 --> 01:20:44,665
and we've pretty much
run out of ideas.

1127
01:20:44,709 --> 01:20:46,450
You're gonna give it up,
just like that?

1128
01:20:46,493 --> 01:20:47,886
No, not exactly.

1129
01:20:47,930 --> 01:20:49,496
Well, that's what
it sounds like.

1130
01:20:49,540 --> 01:20:52,064
We still got places to look,
if you know what I mean.

1131
01:20:52,108 --> 01:20:53,892
No, I don't know what you mean.

1132
01:20:53,936 --> 01:20:55,415
Sir? I don't know what you mean!

1133
01:20:55,459 --> 01:20:56,590
[phone clicks]

1134
01:21:04,511 --> 01:21:06,644
[thunder cracking]

1135
01:21:41,157 --> 01:21:43,376
You ready?

1136
01:21:43,420 --> 01:21:45,465
Yeah.

1137
01:22:32,121 --> 01:22:34,514
[men chattering]

1138
01:22:38,910 --> 01:22:41,173
I just wanted you to know,
unless anything else

1139
01:22:41,217 --> 01:22:45,003
turns up, we're closing
out the investigation.

1140
01:22:45,047 --> 01:22:47,266
You said that yesterday.Well, that was the search.

1141
01:22:47,310 --> 01:22:50,661
I'm telling you
the investigation
is closed, too.

1142
01:22:50,704 --> 01:22:52,663
If she comes back,
if you hear from her,

1143
01:22:52,706 --> 01:22:54,795
if you here anything about her,
you'll let us know?

1144
01:22:54,839 --> 01:22:56,536
Of course.

1145
01:22:58,756 --> 01:23:01,498
Looks like you got away
with it, Senator.

1146
01:23:07,721 --> 01:23:09,332
She left.

1147
01:23:09,375 --> 01:23:11,290
Yeah, and what did you
do with the body?

1148
01:23:16,078 --> 01:23:17,688
She left.

1149
01:23:17,731 --> 01:23:20,517
What about the boat?

1150
01:23:21,779 --> 01:23:23,737
She left.

1151
01:23:23,781 --> 01:23:26,871
She couldn't take living
with a killer, is that it?

1152
01:23:28,525 --> 01:23:30,048
You're sick.

1153
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:38,100
You are sick.

1154
01:23:42,887 --> 01:23:45,063
[spitting]

1155
01:23:45,107 --> 01:23:47,674
Sorry about that,
Mr. Waylan.

1156
01:23:59,512 --> 01:24:00,774
John?

1157
01:24:00,818 --> 01:24:02,341
Hey, John!

1158
01:24:02,385 --> 01:24:03,473
Rebecca, over here.

1159
01:24:03,516 --> 01:24:05,344
Hey, John.

1160
01:24:05,388 --> 01:24:07,346
We've been looking for you.

1161
01:24:07,390 --> 01:24:09,566
[Rebecca]
It's turning colder, John,
we're closing up the cottage.

1162
01:24:09,609 --> 01:24:12,743
The car's all loaded up,
we're going back to the city.

1163
01:24:16,355 --> 01:24:18,357
It--No.

1164
01:24:18,401 --> 01:24:19,924
It's been six weeks, John.

1165
01:24:19,967 --> 01:24:22,318
There's really no point
in your staying.

1166
01:24:24,146 --> 01:24:25,582
I know that.

1167
01:24:25,625 --> 01:24:28,715
John, you're not
gonna find her.

1168
01:24:28,759 --> 01:24:31,762
You're just driving
yourself crazy.

1169
01:24:31,805 --> 01:24:33,503
You can have
the cottage and the boat

1170
01:24:33,546 --> 01:24:34,895
for as long as you like.

1171
01:24:34,939 --> 01:24:36,941
I'm not gonna
try to stop you,

1172
01:24:36,984 --> 01:24:40,336
but it just doesn't
make any sense.

1173
01:25:23,770 --> 01:25:26,295
[teapot whistling]

1174
01:26:10,904 --> 01:26:13,733
[grunting]

1175
01:26:25,267 --> 01:26:27,312
My guess?
I don't need to guess.

1176
01:26:27,356 --> 01:26:28,618
He did it.
He offed her.

1177
01:26:28,661 --> 01:26:31,490
Vinny's the theory man,
I deal in facts.

1178
01:26:31,534 --> 01:26:33,536
The case is wide open.

1179
01:26:33,579 --> 01:26:35,277
It doesn't matter
we didn't find any evidence.

1180
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:38,062
That just means he dumped her
good and deep.

1181
01:26:38,105 --> 01:26:42,066
Evidence ain't the truth.
It's just what's evident.

1182
01:26:42,109 --> 01:26:44,851
Maybe she counted on John

1183
01:26:44,895 --> 01:26:49,465
too much to name the things
that made her happy.

1184
01:26:49,508 --> 01:26:52,511
Love wasn't enough.

1185
01:26:52,555 --> 01:26:54,513
That's the saddest
thing of all.

1186
01:26:54,557 --> 01:26:58,125
All I know is that they came
into the store awful unhappy.

1187
01:26:58,169 --> 01:27:01,259
They sat there unhappy,
they left unhappy.

1188
01:27:01,303 --> 01:27:03,261
'Course, there's another
possibility

1189
01:27:03,305 --> 01:27:05,263
nobody's even thought of.

1190
01:27:05,307 --> 01:27:08,310
Now, just stick this in
the back of your mind somewhere.

1191
01:27:08,353 --> 01:27:12,879
He doesn't have a practice
he can go back to.

1192
01:27:12,923 --> 01:27:16,448
He's facing about
300-grand in campaign debt.

1193
01:27:16,492 --> 01:27:17,841
Right.

1194
01:27:17,884 --> 01:27:22,933
So, first, she vanishes,
and then he vanishes.

1195
01:27:22,976 --> 01:27:26,545
And then, they both
pop up somewhere else.

1196
01:27:26,589 --> 01:27:28,199
Free and clear.

1197
01:27:28,243 --> 01:27:32,116
The Sorcerer's last
and best trick.

1198
01:27:32,159 --> 01:27:36,512
John Waylan?
He's beyond knowing.

1199
01:27:36,555 --> 01:27:39,515
For all my weeks of struggle
with this depressing record,

1200
01:27:39,558 --> 01:27:42,953
all the interviews,
all the travel,

1201
01:27:42,996 --> 01:27:45,869
the man's soul,
for me, remains an absolute

1202
01:27:45,912 --> 01:27:47,740
and impenetrable unknown.

1203
01:27:47,784 --> 01:27:50,308
[siren blaring]

1204
01:27:53,746 --> 01:27:55,966
Sheriff!

1205
01:27:56,009 --> 01:27:59,752
Hurry up,
you gotta hear this!

1206
01:27:59,796 --> 01:28:01,754
What is it?

1207
01:28:03,016 --> 01:28:05,323
Come here.
Listen to this.

1208
01:28:09,545 --> 01:28:11,416
[John] 
We fall in love.

1209
01:28:11,460 --> 01:28:13,766
How could I?

1210
01:28:13,810 --> 01:28:17,727
My bed was made, 
I just lay in it.

1211
01:28:17,770 --> 01:28:19,816
Who's he talking to?

1212
01:28:19,859 --> 01:28:21,252
Beats me.

1213
01:28:21,296 --> 01:28:22,558
Let me something about her.

1214
01:28:22,601 --> 01:28:24,690
God, for all I know.

1215
01:28:24,734 --> 01:28:28,390
My life. My soul.

1216
01:28:28,433 --> 01:28:31,349
Did I mention 
any of this before?

1217
01:28:35,179 --> 01:28:38,051
Did I tumble in love?

1218
01:28:38,095 --> 01:28:39,792
I did.

1219
01:28:41,968 --> 01:28:44,014
Did I stay in love?

1220
01:28:47,191 --> 01:28:49,236
Oh, yes.

1221
01:28:51,587 --> 01:28:54,546
We fall in love.

1222
01:28:54,590 --> 01:28:57,114
You have to picture that.

1223
01:28:59,421 --> 01:29:01,248
Her skin.

1224
01:29:04,208 --> 01:29:05,905
Her soul.

1225
01:29:09,256 --> 01:29:11,258
Oh, Kathy.

1226
01:29:14,740 --> 01:29:16,786
[Leming]
At no point did John Waylan

1227
01:29:16,829 --> 01:29:19,441
admit to the slightest knowledge
of Kathy's whereabouts,

1228
01:29:19,484 --> 01:29:22,487
nor indicate that he was
withholding information.

1229
01:29:22,531 --> 01:29:24,837
Which brings me to wonder,

1230
01:29:24,881 --> 01:29:26,970
is it possible that
even to John Waylan

1231
01:29:27,013 --> 01:29:29,102
everything was
the purest puzzle?

1232
01:29:29,146 --> 01:29:31,757
That the one day he woke up
to find his wife missing,

1233
01:29:31,801 --> 01:29:36,588
and missing forever,
and that all else was unknown.

1234
01:29:36,632 --> 01:29:39,243
[John]
It's a vision of perfection.

1235
01:29:39,286 --> 01:29:41,027
The circle gets smaller
and smaller

1236
01:29:41,071 --> 01:29:42,768
as they devour each other.

1237
01:29:42,812 --> 01:29:44,988
[Kathy]
Which one's left?

1238
01:29:45,031 --> 01:29:46,598
[John]
Neither.

1239
01:29:46,642 --> 01:29:48,600
[Leming]
The ambiguity
may be dissatisfying,

1240
01:29:48,644 --> 01:29:49,688
even irritating.

1241
01:29:49,732 --> 01:29:51,429
But one way or another,
it seems

1242
01:29:51,473 --> 01:29:53,736
we all perform
vanishing tricks,

1243
01:29:53,779 --> 01:29:56,739
defacing history,
and slipping day by day

1244
01:29:56,782 --> 01:29:59,219
into the graying shadows.

1245
01:29:59,263 --> 01:30:01,308
Our whereabouts
are uncertain.

1246
01:30:01,352 --> 01:30:07,402
All secrets lead to the dark,
and beyond, there is only maybe.
