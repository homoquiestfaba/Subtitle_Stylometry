1
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,454
 Oh, great spirit of Halloween.

2
00:01:01,391 --> 00:01:02,924
   I just really wanna know,

3
00:01:04,526 --> 00:01:06,126
 why is Robert not calling me?

4
00:01:22,442 --> 00:01:23,608
- Asshole.

5
00:02:17,057 --> 00:02:18,123
           Hey, Beth.

6
00:02:19,592 --> 00:02:20,858
       No, no, I'm fine.

7
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:23,693
   I just saw a guy standing
       across the street,

8
00:02:24,327 --> 00:02:25,860
   just staring at me, yeah,
     it was really creepy.

9
00:02:29,331 --> 00:02:30,497
     I'm sure it's nothing.

10
00:02:31,665 --> 00:02:33,966
    No, no, I haven't heard
     from Robert all night.

11
00:02:36,635 --> 00:02:38,335
       Beth, let me call
        you right back,

12
00:02:38,337 --> 00:02:39,502
I think someone is at the door.

13
00:03:13,436 --> 00:03:14,536
             Hello?

14
00:03:48,135 --> 00:03:49,201
           Hey, Beth.

15
00:03:50,703 --> 00:03:51,803
             Yeah.

16
00:03:53,806 --> 00:03:57,140
      Some creepy guy left
       a VHS at my door.

17
00:03:58,408 --> 00:03:59,641
         Yeah, a tape.

18
00:04:02,144 --> 00:04:04,512
         I don't know,
     some trick-or-treater

19
00:04:04,514 --> 00:04:05,713
   with nothing better to do.

20
00:04:06,715 --> 00:04:08,749
        Are you kidding,
    of course I have a VCR.

21
00:04:10,218 --> 00:04:12,252
    You know how much better
   <i> Texas Chainsaw Massacre</i>

22
00:04:12,254 --> 00:04:13,920
   looks on VHS than Blu-ray?

23
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:16,787
       No, Blu-ray makes
     everything look fake.

24
00:04:18,356 --> 00:04:20,657
     Okay, well, have fun.

25
00:04:21,492 --> 00:04:22,558
   I'll talk to you tomorrow.

26
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,659
           Okay, bye.

27
00:04:55,588 --> 00:04:57,288
When I was a little girl,
           we used to

28
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:59,156
plant pumpkins in our backyard.

29
00:04:59,624 --> 00:05:01,257
Did they have
      pumpkins back then?

30
00:05:01,524 --> 00:05:02,891
Yeah,
      and they didn't cost

31
00:05:02,893 --> 00:05:04,692
   25 fucking dollars either.

32
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:06,292
Fucking!

33
00:05:06,294 --> 00:05:07,660
         When can we go
       trick-or-treating?

34
00:05:07,861 --> 00:05:09,428
    Don't you wanna make our
     jack-o'-lantern first?

35
00:05:09,595 --> 00:05:10,661
            Why?

36
00:05:11,095 --> 00:05:12,195
      So we can put it out
    here on the front steps.

37
00:05:31,281 --> 00:05:34,049
  Pumpkin soup, pumpkin bread,

38
00:05:34,051 --> 00:05:35,316
         pumpkin pie...

39
00:05:35,817 --> 00:05:38,451
  Maybe your mom can make you
   pumpkin pancakes tomorrow.

40
00:05:41,253 --> 00:05:42,686
 Why don't you take one of your
   crayons and draw the face?

41
00:05:46,289 --> 00:05:47,489
           You do it.

42
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,957
   Do you want a happy face?

43
00:05:50,792 --> 00:05:51,892
         A scary face?

44
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:53,093
          Scary face!

45
00:05:53,095 --> 00:05:54,193
Excellent.

46
00:05:57,096 --> 00:05:58,963
   So what we're gonna first,

47
00:05:58,965 --> 00:06:00,764
   is cut a hole in the top.

48
00:06:00,766 --> 00:06:01,998
              Why?

49
00:06:02,466 --> 00:06:04,966
        So we can scoop
        out the insides.

50
00:06:06,568 --> 00:06:07,834
Like brains?

51
00:06:07,836 --> 00:06:09,235
       Yes, like brains.

52
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:11,802
     Speaking of brains...

53
00:06:14,505 --> 00:06:16,806
      Looks like Elliott's
      working late again.

54
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:22,677
When's
       Daddy coming over?

55
00:06:23,178 --> 00:06:25,179
       Well, it better be
     in the next 15 minutes

56
00:06:25,181 --> 00:06:27,413
       or somebody is not
   having a happy Halloween.

57
00:06:30,183 --> 00:06:31,917
    Can pumpkins feel pain?

58
00:06:33,019 --> 00:06:34,185
         Of course not.

59
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,587
 Like that lobster my dad threw

60
00:06:37,589 --> 00:06:39,555
in the boiling water that time?

61
00:06:40,023 --> 00:06:41,423
          It screamed.

62
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:45,025
     Okay, so why don't you
     scoop out the insides?

63
00:06:47,928 --> 00:06:49,128
             Gross!

64
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:50,295
You want me to do it?

65
00:06:50,297 --> 00:06:51,996
              -No.
             -Okay.

66
00:06:57,101 --> 00:06:58,434
  So while you are doing that,

67
00:06:58,436 --> 00:07:00,335
   I will separate the seeds.

68
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:01,502
Why?

69
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:02,736
      So we can cook them.

70
00:07:06,473 --> 00:07:08,040
            Brains.

71
00:07:08,674 --> 00:07:10,408
    Good, now for the face.

72
00:07:11,943 --> 00:07:13,076
       Watch your hands.

73
00:07:34,698 --> 00:07:36,198
 Is that scary enough for you?

74
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,365
              Wow!

75
00:07:37,367 --> 00:07:38,733
Good.

76
00:07:40,535 --> 00:07:42,168
 Okay, so why don't you grab me

77
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,435
    that candle over there?

78
00:07:48,006 --> 00:07:49,106
           All right.

79
00:08:01,485 --> 00:08:02,651
            <i> Voila.</i>

80
00:08:20,369 --> 00:08:22,001
<i> Hey, guys,</i>
       <i> you got Elliott,</i>

81
00:08:22,003 --> 00:08:23,268
      <i> I can't take your</i>
     <i> phone call right now</i>

82
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,069
     <i> for whatever reason,</i>

83
00:08:25,337 --> 00:08:26,970
     <i> but you already know</i>
  <i> what to do with the beep,</i>

84
00:08:26,972 --> 00:08:28,972
 <i> baby-boo, happy Halloweener.</i>

85
00:08:30,474 --> 00:08:33,042
Do you think I'm stupid?

86
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:35,544
Don't even bother coming over.

87
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:38,546
   And tell Angie Del-Frisco
          I said, hi.

88
00:08:40,048 --> 00:08:41,381
Close your eyes.

89
00:08:41,383 --> 00:08:43,516
They're closed.

90
00:08:44,017 --> 00:08:45,384
Okay, now!

91
00:08:49,021 --> 00:08:50,321
              Oh!

92
00:08:50,323 --> 00:08:52,289
  It's supposed to scare you!

93
00:08:52,623 --> 00:08:53,923
I'm terrified.

94
00:08:54,157 --> 00:08:55,357
  Do you want a pumpkin seed?

95
00:08:59,861 --> 00:09:01,294
   Don't, honey, he'll choke.

96
00:09:11,669 --> 00:09:13,603
          Here, here.

97
00:09:15,504 --> 00:09:18,606
      Okay, cough, cough!

98
00:09:18,907 --> 00:09:19,973
          Jack, cough!

99
00:09:30,482 --> 00:09:35,552
- Jack?

100
00:09:41,224 --> 00:09:43,892
All right, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

101
00:09:43,894 --> 00:09:45,627
     I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

102
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,564
   Your mom is gonna kill me.

103
00:09:52,098 --> 00:09:53,465
             Okay.

104
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:55,632
--Shut up, Oscar!

105
00:09:58,235 --> 00:09:59,468
             Okay.

106
00:10:02,372 --> 00:10:03,604
          What the...?

107
00:10:05,239 --> 00:10:06,305
             Jack?

108
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:09,774
             Okay.

109
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:11,842
             Okay.

110
00:10:20,851 --> 00:10:23,152
      Okay, breathe, Jack.

111
00:11:04,388 --> 00:11:05,453
Jack!

112
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,093
Trick or treat!

113
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:08,602
      Ho, excuse me buddy.

114
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:21,947
        Hello beautiful!

115
00:12:22,715 --> 00:12:23,781
            <i> Lizzy?</i>

116
00:12:25,984 --> 00:12:27,084
            <i> Lizzy?</i>

117
00:13:04,752 --> 00:13:06,918
Easy, girl!

118
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:09,787
Trick or treat.

119
00:13:13,523 --> 00:13:14,656
          Stay there.

120
00:13:22,396 --> 00:13:23,662
   You be careful out there.

121
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,092
         Knock, knock,
      knock, knock, knock

122
00:13:56,094 --> 00:13:57,159
          Who's there?

123
00:13:57,426 --> 00:14:00,161
         Sam and Janet,
       Sam and Janet who?

124
00:14:00,562 --> 00:14:01,695
        Trick or treat?

125
00:14:02,196 --> 00:14:05,497
    Aren't you all a little
   late to be out this young?

126
00:14:06,398 --> 00:14:08,365
       Especially with...

127
00:14:13,135 --> 00:14:18,105
       Shh, I'll see what
        I can find, shh!

128
00:14:26,745 --> 00:14:28,712
   It's not much, I'm afraid.

129
00:14:29,113 --> 00:14:31,080
       You should manage
       more than anyone,

130
00:14:31,082 --> 00:14:32,181
       you're the devil.

131
00:14:32,482 --> 00:14:36,785
      Lucifer, Beelzebub,
        the Horned One.

132
00:15:41,979 --> 00:15:43,112
           <i> Go away.</i>

133
00:15:47,349 --> 00:15:48,515
       <i> Trick or treat.</i>

134
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:50,416
  You've got to be kidding me.

135
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:09,633
           <i> Go home,</i>
<i> there's nothing for you here.</i>

136
00:16:11,069 --> 00:16:12,502
 <i> Do kids even know Halloween?</i>

137
00:16:14,304 --> 00:16:16,204
      <i> Bad things happen</i>
       <i> to trespassers.</i>

138
00:16:29,784 --> 00:16:31,584
      Kate, get down here!

139
00:16:36,255 --> 00:16:37,488
       <i> Trick or treat.</i>

140
00:16:42,926 --> 00:16:45,928
         I said scram,
 don't make me come out there,

141
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:48,063
     go bother someone else
      and leave us alone.

142
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:50,331
<i>Now get the hell of my property!</i>

143
00:16:57,304 --> 00:16:58,537
      Jack, they're kids.

144
00:16:59,372 --> 00:17:00,438
     Maybe we should let...

145
00:17:02,107 --> 00:17:03,239
I think
        they're leaving.

146
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:07,242
What if
      they need our help?

147
00:17:38,035 --> 00:17:40,236
      Kate, it's not safe,

148
00:17:40,238 --> 00:17:42,571
     we can't just open the
    door for anyone anymore.

149
00:17:42,573 --> 00:17:43,738
         They're kids.

150
00:17:44,206 --> 00:17:45,806
They're hungry, we have enough.

151
00:17:45,808 --> 00:17:48,141
         No, we're not
 taking that chance, not again!

152
00:17:48,742 --> 00:17:50,909
    They could be infected,
      they could be crazy

153
00:17:50,911 --> 00:17:52,210
    for all we know, I mean,

154
00:17:52,212 --> 00:17:53,778
   they think it's Halloween!

155
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,047
    I think it is Halloween.

156
00:17:58,149 --> 00:18:00,150
        They're getting
     nothing from us, Kate.

157
00:18:01,218 --> 00:18:02,751
 We have to protect ourselves.

158
00:18:02,753 --> 00:18:03,885
           From what?

159
00:18:04,887 --> 00:18:05,953
             This?

160
00:18:21,903 --> 00:18:23,103
  Everything is gonna be okay.

161
00:18:34,848 --> 00:18:36,014
     I guess they're gone.

162
00:18:36,016 --> 00:18:37,148
   I don't see them anymore.

163
00:18:38,885 --> 00:18:39,984
             Good.

164
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:42,319
Let them go harass someone else.

165
00:18:44,789 --> 00:18:45,855
             Honey?

166
00:18:53,563 --> 00:18:54,796
             Kate?

167
00:19:01,735 --> 00:19:03,335
Jack!

168
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:07,037
          Kate, Kate!

169
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,204
Kate.

170
00:19:13,076 --> 00:19:14,476
             Jack.

171
00:19:33,429 --> 00:19:34,828
        Where's my wife,

172
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,529
 what did you do with my wife?

173
00:19:37,397 --> 00:19:38,797
    What do you want, food?

174
00:19:39,565 --> 00:19:42,400
            Take it,
   just take it and get out.

175
00:19:42,402 --> 00:19:45,503
It's too late, Jack.

176
00:20:05,423 --> 00:20:07,257
It's too late, Jack.

177
00:20:11,996 --> 00:20:13,462
      It's too late, Jack.

178
00:20:19,034 --> 00:20:20,834
        Too late, Jack.

179
00:20:57,838 --> 00:20:59,605
          Kate, Kate!

180
00:21:30,264 --> 00:21:31,797
Happy Halloween.

181
00:22:45,064 --> 00:22:46,998
          Hey, relax.

182
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:50,334
       It always happens
      this way, remember.

183
00:22:51,502 --> 00:22:53,336
        It's not exactly
     something you forget.

184
00:23:07,683 --> 00:23:08,749
           That's it.

185
00:23:10,985 --> 00:23:12,251
            So, go.

186
00:23:39,445 --> 00:23:40,878
    It's looking good, Dad.

187
00:23:49,687 --> 00:23:50,753
         It's not here.

188
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,754
             -What?
           -The meat.

189
00:23:54,389 --> 00:23:56,356
         It has to be,
     you grabbed it, right?

190
00:23:56,358 --> 00:23:57,657
         I don't know,
        I thought I did,

191
00:23:57,659 --> 00:23:59,058
       it was right there
         on the table.

192
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,159
  Well, did you or didn't you?

193
00:24:00,161 --> 00:24:01,593
        I thought I did!

194
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:07,798
        Christ, you said
       you had the meat!

195
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,899
  I don't know, I don't know,

196
00:24:08,901 --> 00:24:10,700
  I was scared, I was rushing.

197
00:24:10,702 --> 00:24:11,901
         Unbelievable!

198
00:24:16,338 --> 00:24:17,538
          We're fine.

199
00:24:18,473 --> 00:24:19,772
     We'll figure this out.

200
00:24:22,408 --> 00:24:24,609
         We're fucked.

201
00:24:33,216 --> 00:24:34,616
  You've got to go out there.

202
00:24:36,985 --> 00:24:39,419
    It's been years, Isaac,
 he won't listen to me anymore,

203
00:24:39,421 --> 00:24:41,854
      he'll listen to you,
   you haven't missed a year.

204
00:24:41,856 --> 00:24:44,056
    But this is your fault.

205
00:24:44,058 --> 00:24:46,658
    -This is your offering!
            -I know.

206
00:24:51,763 --> 00:24:52,929
            Please.

207
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:04,839
        Be ready to go.

208
00:25:14,349 --> 00:25:15,448
Son...

209
00:25:17,951 --> 00:25:19,084
           thank you.

210
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:31,495
<i> It's me!</i>

211
00:25:35,001 --> 00:25:36,367
       My father's here.

212
00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:39,303
     But he made a mistake.

213
00:25:46,477 --> 00:25:47,810
        There's no meat.

214
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,246
It's a mistake,
          we're sorry.

215
00:25:53,748 --> 00:25:55,482
 We'll bring double next time.

216
00:25:59,386 --> 00:26:01,920
 Please, just take what's here.

217
00:26:04,224 --> 00:26:05,323
Please!

218
00:26:31,747 --> 00:26:32,812
          Oh, my God.

219
00:26:36,682 --> 00:26:37,748
Forgive me.

220
00:26:41,886 --> 00:26:44,554
         Open the door,
     open the fucking door!

221
00:26:44,556 --> 00:26:46,289
        -It won't open.
       -What do you mean?

222
00:26:46,291 --> 00:26:47,790
It's jammed or something.

223
00:26:49,192 --> 00:26:50,959
       For Christ's sake,
         Dad, the door!

224
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:56,797
             Dad...

225
00:27:00,534 --> 00:27:02,034
  He's coming soon, isn't he?

226
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,178
<i> Hi,</i>
       <i> this is Vanessa,</i>

227
00:29:33,512 --> 00:29:35,379
   <i> I'm not home right now,</i>
<i>leave a message after the beep.</i>

228
00:29:35,381 --> 00:29:38,948
--Vanessa, hello?

229
00:29:41,451 --> 00:29:44,219
      I've been sitting at
      JB's for 45 minutes

230
00:29:44,221 --> 00:29:47,455
       getting hit on by
     the dregs of humanity

231
00:29:47,457 --> 00:29:49,122
        and your ass is
      nowhere to be seen.

232
00:29:51,792 --> 00:29:53,425
- Hello?

233
00:30:15,908 --> 00:30:17,041
            Vanessa?

234
00:35:07,884 --> 00:35:09,251
            Oh, hey.

235
00:35:12,254 --> 00:35:14,822
    I, uh, was just about to
    take those stairs again.

236
00:35:24,431 --> 00:35:25,697
        Looks like we're
       the last ones, eh?

237
00:35:25,699 --> 00:35:27,031
       Yeah, I think so,

238
00:35:27,033 --> 00:35:28,232
      but I didn't realize
        it was so late.

239
00:35:28,866 --> 00:35:30,233
Oh, yeah, well at least
we're getting out of here.

240
00:35:30,834 --> 00:35:32,467
     Looks like I'm pulling
        an all-nighter.

241
00:36:56,679 --> 00:36:58,513
           Goddammit.

242
00:36:59,181 --> 00:37:00,581
     These fucking things.

243
00:37:06,987 --> 00:37:08,520
I don't think that's gonna help.

244
00:37:12,457 --> 00:37:13,757
      Just your luck, huh?

245
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:23,731
         Are you okay?

246
00:37:26,501 --> 00:37:27,734
    Are you claustrophobic?

247
00:37:31,371 --> 00:37:32,537
          Don't worry.

248
00:37:33,539 --> 00:37:35,106
     There's plenty of room
      in here to breathe.

249
00:37:36,975 --> 00:37:38,208
         We'll be fine.

250
00:37:40,211 --> 00:37:41,844
      I mean this happened
        just last month,

251
00:37:41,846 --> 00:37:44,512
   just give it a second and
    it should reset itself.

252
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:55,688
   I think it might be a good
     idea if you sit down.

253
00:38:05,563 --> 00:38:07,897
       Is there something
       I can do to help?

254
00:38:08,498 --> 00:38:10,398
    No, no, I'll be fine.

255
00:38:23,178 --> 00:38:25,411
   Well, I guess we're stuck
  here until it resets itself.

256
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,080
  Or until somebody finds us.

257
00:39:07,017 --> 00:39:09,018
       Sorry, bad habit.

258
00:39:18,695 --> 00:39:20,461
  You're up on 26 aren't you?

259
00:39:22,931 --> 00:39:24,998
      Yeah, I'm sure I've
        seen you before.

260
00:39:32,238 --> 00:39:34,439
   It's a shame what happened
  to that girl from up there.

261
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:42,880
            Too bad.

262
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:05,067
             Hey...

263
00:40:58,917 --> 00:41:01,718
    Don't you fucking move,
         lock it down.

264
00:41:32,349 --> 00:41:33,549
             Jesus.

265
00:41:50,865 --> 00:41:54,033
        All right, Sam,
  how did you get out of that?

266
00:41:54,035 --> 00:41:55,834
     It's too early for my
   dad to close his bar tab.

267
00:41:57,202 --> 00:41:58,368
          Hey, Wheezy,
     you're wheezing again.

268
00:41:58,869 --> 00:42:00,703
    Yeah, forgot my inhaler.

269
00:42:00,705 --> 00:42:02,738
       Wow, what's this?

270
00:42:03,706 --> 00:42:06,340
 Step right up, step right up!

271
00:42:06,342 --> 00:42:10,210
          For the one,
      the only, Masochist!

272
00:42:12,111 --> 00:42:16,280
     Relieve that tension,
   take out that aggression,

273
00:42:16,282 --> 00:42:21,184
 in a game so cruel it's cool.

274
00:42:21,618 --> 00:42:24,019
    Give him what he wants,

275
00:42:24,021 --> 00:42:26,087
       get what you want.

276
00:42:26,354 --> 00:42:27,687
      What are the rules?

277
00:42:28,555 --> 00:42:31,123
     Use anything you see,

278
00:42:31,125 --> 00:42:34,559
       to make him bleed.

279
00:42:34,561 --> 00:42:36,060
       Get enough blood,

280
00:42:36,227 --> 00:42:38,127
      win yourself a bud.

281
00:42:38,129 --> 00:42:39,261
      I'll give it a shot.

282
00:42:40,062 --> 00:42:41,796
      You may be a winner

283
00:42:41,798 --> 00:42:43,898
  by giving it to this sinner,

284
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:46,400
      take your pick, son,
        take your pick.

285
00:42:46,968 --> 00:42:48,001
           This one.

286
00:42:48,003 --> 00:42:52,738
     Ah, pins for the sins.

287
00:42:55,141 --> 00:42:57,108
         How about you?

288
00:42:57,909 --> 00:42:59,242
No thanks.

289
00:42:59,244 --> 00:43:01,544
          Jesus, Sam,
    stop being such a puss.

290
00:43:02,546 --> 00:43:03,712
          I'll do it.

291
00:43:03,714 --> 00:43:05,980
        Take your pick,
        take your pick.

292
00:43:07,048 --> 00:43:08,314
             These.

293
00:43:08,915 --> 00:43:12,083
       You can cross this
      off your wish list.

294
00:43:12,918 --> 00:43:16,086
Now, give it to this masochist!

295
00:43:21,992 --> 00:43:23,758
<i> Thanks,</i>
        <i> I needed that.</i>

296
00:43:27,662 --> 00:43:30,162
<i> Now I'm getting ticklish.</i>

297
00:43:31,164 --> 00:43:32,230
              Sam!

298
00:43:32,664 --> 00:43:34,665
        Oh, my God, Dad!

299
00:43:34,667 --> 00:43:36,199
         Sam, come on,

300
00:43:36,201 --> 00:43:37,667
     help me get these off,
      get me off of here!

301
00:43:37,669 --> 00:43:39,235
- Give him what he wants.
- Sam!

302
00:43:41,271 --> 00:43:42,738
       Get what you want.

303
00:43:50,045 --> 00:43:51,578
       You can win, Sam.

304
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:53,512
Come on,
  help me, get me off of here!

305
00:43:55,781 --> 00:43:58,115
         Looks like we
       may have a winner,

306
00:43:58,117 --> 00:44:00,250
- if he gives it to
No, Sam, don't do it!

307
00:44:00,252 --> 00:44:01,484
- this sinner!
- Sam, stop!

308
00:44:06,623 --> 00:44:08,022
        Sam, just stop!

309
00:44:08,456 --> 00:44:10,857
    Ah, stop, stop it, Sam!

310
00:44:14,462 --> 00:44:15,794
        Sam, just stop!

311
00:44:15,796 --> 00:44:17,262
        Quit crying like
      a little girl, Dad.

312
00:44:17,429 --> 00:44:18,629
      Where's your balls?

313
00:44:18,631 --> 00:44:20,864
Stop, Sam,
        I'm sorry, Sam--

314
00:44:27,536 --> 00:44:29,570
      Sam, Sam, I'm sorry!

315
00:44:30,973 --> 00:44:33,106
           Sam, Sam!

316
00:44:39,879 --> 00:44:41,279
     Step right up, folks,

317
00:44:41,281 --> 00:44:44,314
        a game so cruel

318
00:44:45,149 --> 00:44:46,849
           it's cool.

319
00:46:27,345 --> 00:46:28,611
              Max?

320
00:46:30,847 --> 00:46:32,614
   You can't keep doing this.

321
00:46:38,353 --> 00:46:40,420
There's nothing to be scared of.

322
00:46:43,557 --> 00:46:44,924
        Go back to bed.

323
00:46:49,595 --> 00:46:50,995
       Come on, jump up.

324
00:46:55,767 --> 00:46:56,933
             Empty.

325
00:47:03,105 --> 00:47:05,005
     Messy, but no monster!

326
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:07,907
        -Come on.
      -It ate my slipper.

327
00:47:07,909 --> 00:47:09,942
Monsters don't
      eat slippers, under.

328
00:47:09,944 --> 00:47:11,376
     What about the noise?

329
00:47:11,378 --> 00:47:14,112
Baby, it's just the wind.

330
00:47:14,114 --> 00:47:16,047
        The entire house
        has been sprayed

331
00:47:16,049 --> 00:47:18,482
       and inspected for
    anything bad, I promise.

332
00:47:19,116 --> 00:47:21,283
     What happens when you
      throw water on them?

333
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:23,083
Monsters hate water.

334
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:35,293
      What did I say about
      playing with those?

335
00:47:35,295 --> 00:47:37,528
            -Not to.
           -Give 'em.

336
00:47:48,939 --> 00:47:50,873
       I'm gonna put this
       right here, okay?

337
00:47:57,413 --> 00:47:58,946
     Just close your eyes.

338
00:48:00,214 --> 00:48:02,548
And think happy, happy thoughts.

339
00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:05,384
    And when you wake
      up it'll be morning.

340
00:48:06,452 --> 00:48:07,652
          Good night.

341
00:48:16,227 --> 00:48:17,627
      Don't shut the door.

342
00:50:41,566 --> 00:50:42,732
Max?

343
00:50:45,836 --> 00:50:48,070
    Max were you playing in
     the guest room again?

344
00:50:48,072 --> 00:50:49,371
No.

345
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:51,806
      Really, then what's
    around your neck?

346
00:51:09,491 --> 00:51:11,258
         Mrs. Lieberman
      called this morning,

347
00:51:11,525 --> 00:51:13,158
        she said you're
     telling stories again.

348
00:51:14,593 --> 00:51:16,160
    Max, please look at me.

349
00:51:18,730 --> 00:51:21,364
  You're giving Little Scotty
   Michaels nightmares again.

350
00:51:21,366 --> 00:51:23,199
   He's afraid of everything,

351
00:51:23,201 --> 00:51:25,434
     he doesn't play in the
  sandbox because he's afraid

352
00:51:25,436 --> 00:51:26,835
  the worms are gonna eat him.

353
00:51:26,837 --> 00:51:28,837
       Well, that doesn't
    make it any less scary,

354
00:51:28,839 --> 00:51:30,738
       he's still afraid
     like you are at night.

355
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:32,172
       It's not the same.

356
00:51:32,606 --> 00:51:34,506
      Well, how's it like?

357
00:51:35,407 --> 00:51:36,640
              Max?

358
00:51:45,048 --> 00:51:46,281
         You know, um,

359
00:51:46,582 --> 00:51:48,249
when you were still in diapers,

360
00:51:48,583 --> 00:51:50,951
        we lived in this
      100-year-old cabin,

361
00:51:51,252 --> 00:51:52,852
       you should've seen
        this place, Max.

362
00:51:53,186 --> 00:51:55,420
     It was very different
     from anything I knew.

363
00:51:55,422 --> 00:51:57,255
 And on one really windy night,

364
00:51:57,257 --> 00:51:58,689
    I put you down to sleep,

365
00:51:59,057 --> 00:52:01,691
   and I heard these noises.

366
00:52:02,225 --> 00:52:03,892
 Coming from outside the house

367
00:52:03,894 --> 00:52:05,493
   and I got a little scared.

368
00:52:06,094 --> 00:52:07,761
     So I checked that all
    the doors were locked,

369
00:52:07,763 --> 00:52:08,862
  and then I called your dad,

370
00:52:08,864 --> 00:52:09,963
     but he didn't pick up.

371
00:52:10,564 --> 00:52:14,033
       I lied in bed and
    I tried closing my eyes,

372
00:52:14,035 --> 00:52:15,968
     but I couldn't sleep,

373
00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:18,971
          so I got up,
    I looked out the window

374
00:52:18,973 --> 00:52:22,807
    and I only saw darkness.

375
00:52:24,242 --> 00:52:27,944
And I remember that my heart
   was beating so fast, Max,

376
00:52:27,946 --> 00:52:30,646
      then my imagination
    just started going wild,

377
00:52:30,648 --> 00:52:31,713
        I was thinking,

378
00:52:32,281 --> 00:52:33,614
  oh, gosh, what if someone's
       trying to break in

379
00:52:33,616 --> 00:52:34,781
        or maybe it's a
       bear, or Bigfoot,

380
00:52:34,783 --> 00:52:36,149
       or, I didn't know!

381
00:52:36,151 --> 00:52:37,817
  And as the noises continued,

382
00:52:37,819 --> 00:52:39,985
     I became more certain
   that something was there,

383
00:52:39,987 --> 00:52:41,486
       and it wasn't just
         the wind, Max,

384
00:52:41,488 --> 00:52:43,287
    and I knew that I needed
      to stand my ground,

385
00:52:43,289 --> 00:52:44,721
    because that's what your
      father would've done

386
00:52:44,723 --> 00:52:45,855
    if he were home, right?

387
00:52:46,289 --> 00:52:47,722
    So I put my slippers on,

388
00:52:47,724 --> 00:52:49,090
     I grabbed a flashlight

389
00:52:49,092 --> 00:52:50,558
     and I walked outside.

390
00:52:50,825 --> 00:52:53,660
   And my heart was pounding.

391
00:52:54,128 --> 00:52:56,496
          Boom, boom.

392
00:52:57,130 --> 00:52:59,498
       And then suddenly,
       I saw two red eyes

393
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:00,899
      staring back at me,

394
00:53:00,901 --> 00:53:03,301
          I pointed my
     flashlight right at it

395
00:53:03,303 --> 00:53:04,568
    and you know what I saw?

396
00:53:04,802 --> 00:53:05,968
            What?

397
00:53:06,803 --> 00:53:09,538
A raccoon.

398
00:53:13,475 --> 00:53:14,708
          No monster?

399
00:53:15,076 --> 00:53:19,412
        No, it was just
      this little raccoon,

400
00:53:19,414 --> 00:53:21,547
    just playing with these
      old milk containers.

401
00:55:36,047 --> 00:55:37,213
<i> Holy mackerel!</i>

402
00:55:47,055 --> 00:55:49,121
<i> Yow!</i>

403
00:55:54,093 --> 00:55:55,225
Time for bed.

404
00:56:00,564 --> 00:56:01,630
            Come on.

405
00:56:13,309 --> 00:56:14,642
     You've had a busy day.

406
00:56:17,312 --> 00:56:19,079
     You're gonna sleep in
    your room tonight, okay?

407
00:56:20,247 --> 00:56:21,380
          Good night.

408
00:58:07,881 --> 00:58:09,081
            Go away!

409
00:59:03,633 --> 00:59:05,800
Mom, Mom!

410
00:59:05,802 --> 00:59:08,169
Mom, Mom, wake up, Mom, wake up,

411
00:59:08,171 --> 00:59:09,737
       Mom, hurry, hurry,
       I caught it, Mom!

412
00:59:09,739 --> 00:59:11,505
       Max, what's wrong,
         what's wrong?

413
00:59:11,507 --> 00:59:12,672
        Hurry, come on,
     come on, I caught it!

414
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:13,739
What's wrong, Max?

415
00:59:13,741 --> 00:59:14,973
       Max, what's wrong?

416
00:59:14,975 --> 00:59:15,974
It's under there.

417
00:59:15,976 --> 00:59:17,408
     Why is the floor wet?

418
00:59:17,410 --> 00:59:20,477
             -Mom!
         -Max, stop it,

419
00:59:20,479 --> 00:59:22,011
      there's no monster!

420
01:00:40,890 --> 01:00:42,123
            Monster!

421
01:00:44,059 --> 01:00:45,392
     We're coming for you.

422
01:00:47,928 --> 01:00:49,061
       Did you hear that?

423
01:00:49,228 --> 01:00:50,394
        Quick, this way.

424
01:00:50,396 --> 01:00:51,628
        Here, get down.

425
01:00:53,897 --> 01:00:54,963
             Okay.

426
01:00:56,265 --> 01:00:57,431
          Put this on.

427
01:00:58,232 --> 01:00:59,298
           Take this.

428
01:01:02,669 --> 01:01:04,002
  You go near the nightstand,

429
01:01:04,336 --> 01:01:07,004
     I'm gonna investigate
      near the toy shelf,

430
01:01:07,006 --> 01:01:09,739
   and we meet by your pillow
   at 22 hundred hours, okay?

431
01:01:10,507 --> 01:01:11,840
             What?

432
01:01:11,842 --> 01:01:13,942
        Thirty seconds,
    go, Max, go, go, go, go!

433
01:01:23,685 --> 01:01:24,918
      Do you see anything?

434
01:01:26,053 --> 01:01:27,686
Uh, a few casualties,

435
01:01:27,688 --> 01:01:30,155
       I think Stevie the
        Bear is wounded!

436
01:01:30,422 --> 01:01:32,356
           -Save him!
          -Copy, copy!

437
01:01:34,092 --> 01:01:35,459
     Quick, under the bed!

438
01:01:36,861 --> 01:01:38,361
 The monster is under the bed!

439
01:01:58,013 --> 01:01:59,113
         Did I get him?

440
01:02:03,484 --> 01:02:04,784
        I think you did.

441
01:02:20,333 --> 01:02:21,566
         Snug as a bug.

442
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:37,313
      It's time for sleep.

443
01:02:42,051 --> 01:02:43,384
          I love you.

444
01:02:43,386 --> 01:02:44,485
          Good night.

445
01:03:00,366 --> 01:03:03,400
              Mom!

446
01:03:47,439 --> 01:03:48,839
         Motherfucker!

447
01:03:54,746 --> 01:03:55,878
            Shut up!

448
01:05:39,674 --> 01:05:40,740
Trick or treat!

449
01:06:10,603 --> 01:06:11,970
           Okay now.

450
01:06:12,938 --> 01:06:16,273
Come here, come here, come here.

451
01:06:16,275 --> 01:06:17,607
             Yeah.

452
01:07:12,150 --> 01:07:13,750
         Motherfucker!

453
01:07:19,289 --> 01:07:20,821
Oh, my God!

454
01:07:22,123 --> 01:07:25,592
     This looks so amazing!

455
01:07:25,826 --> 01:07:28,661
  Mr. Tricker you always have,
         like, the best

456
01:07:28,663 --> 01:07:30,329
     Halloween decorations!

457
01:07:30,830 --> 01:07:34,365
   Oh, my gosh, this one is,
         like, so real!

458
01:07:34,799 --> 01:07:37,100
- It's, like...

459
01:07:37,102 --> 01:07:38,501
     Is this a real person?

460
01:07:39,603 --> 01:07:42,338
I'm just kidding!

461
01:07:43,306 --> 01:07:47,108
   I just love all this like
 murder-y stuff and everything,

462
01:07:47,110 --> 01:07:49,443
  it's, like, totally puts me

463
01:07:49,445 --> 01:07:51,778
in, like, the spirit of the day

464
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:53,379
       and that's, like,
        what it's about,

465
01:07:53,381 --> 01:07:54,947
    because it's Halloween,
        and it's, like,

466
01:07:54,949 --> 01:07:56,548
  sometimes we lose sight of,
             like,

467
01:07:56,550 --> 01:07:58,616
  what is Halloween about, so,

468
01:07:58,618 --> 01:08:00,284
    thank you, Mr. Tricker.

469
01:08:00,286 --> 01:08:02,185
         Awesome, well,
    have a happy Halloween!

470
01:18:07,981 --> 01:18:09,214
           Fuck this.

471
01:19:33,357 --> 01:19:34,423
       Fucking, fucking!

472
01:19:34,425 --> 01:19:35,590
             Yeah.
