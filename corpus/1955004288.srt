87
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:59,275
Most rumors there were in
recent years about Jared.

00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:19,965
This must then be Ben. Jared had never
more than two seconds the same girlfriend.

Who should do it?

99
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,340
Who is the first since.

100
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:29,638
That sounds like a race.
- Should it be.

101
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,720
You are my best reporters.

102

The first to have the story,
is chief of "Pulse Gossip Online".

00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:15,517
Can you find out where he is?
I need to get some things done.

00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,106
At it.

110
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:21,898
Hey Julie!

111
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,738
Not flip out, but Maggie Tannehill
is on Big Bear since yesterday.

112
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,573
But as they were going
until next week out.

113
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,738
This is not
all. Wes is already there.

114
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,324
What? That should be my story.

115
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,328
What you wanna do?
- The only thing I can!

116
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,294
He will not get my story.

117
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,793
Are you sure that here
correct is? I just seh snow.

118

What was the last side street?

119

00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:33,432
Greta, you may have accidentally
ne bag with clothes packed,

123
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,677
before you in the snow
Mountains are jetted?

124
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,974
I buy me what if I since
am. The time is now more important.

125
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,972
Wes can not win.

126
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:42,976
And you're about
thinking, where are you sleeping?

127
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,522
What?
- Well,

128
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:48,732
Motel, Hotel, crib. We have

00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:50,028
I forgot.

130
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,117
You know, I admire you as a boss,

131
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,612
but that is not a very
carefully thought-out plan.

132
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:57,536
Maybe you come down first
back and plan it reasonable?

133
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,408
This is no longer now.

134
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:03,667

135
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,209

Greta, can you hear me?

137
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,130

138
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:10,632

That's so cold!

153
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,314
No need to panic. No panic.

154
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:06,627
I'm so sorry, Bridezilla.
But it's about survival.

Come here, come here.

So. Now warm up nicely.

Come on.

163
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,603
Hi.

00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:55,903
Hi?

165
00:10:56,030 --> 00:11:00,741
You almost die in snowstorm
and you think of anything as "hi"?

166
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:05,829
Take it easy. Always nice and slow.

167
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,535
All right?

168
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,498
Yes, uh ...

00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,217
Sorry. What

You probably had a bad day.

00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:28,769
Uh, yeah, no. You could say so.

173
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,806
Can I guess? Bride on the run?

174
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:35,192
Almost Bride on the run.

175
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:38,899
I can not talk about it.

176
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:44,827
But you have the right
Shoes for escape.

177
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:50,291
This was a small insider between
me and my fiance, Al.

178
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:55,588
Al loves running shoes.
And cheese danish.

179
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,749
I'm sorry.

180
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:03,004
That's okay, that is, which is already
again good. In a few weeks.

181
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:05,343
What's your name?

00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:08,388
I'm Greta Kannnnnabelsteinsky.

183
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:10,974
Kanabelss ...?
- Steinsky.

184
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:13,855
Well, that's, uh ...

185
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:15,808
Where does the name come from?

186
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,734
Ellis Iceland.

187
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:22,315
Yes, there were the, uh, there was
the, uh, families together, as the ...

188
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,816
What is your name?

189
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:24,858
Ben.

190
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:27,407
Only Ben?

191
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,156
Only Ben.

192
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:33,163
And that's Brudy. Come here!

193
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:36,545
Nice to meet you,
"Only Brudy." Hi!

194
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,168
Brav!

195
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:42,506
"Only Ben", may I
short use your phone?

196
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,087
You can, but it will
You may not make a lot of joy.

197
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:48,807
The fixed network is currently broken and
you do not have cell phone reception here.

198
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:51,310
In comes the storm
here today none away.

199
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,393
Okay.

200
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:55,731
I suppose you have no fresh
Packed clothes before ...

201
00:12:57,402 --> 00:13:00,861
Uh, no. Today was simply only
one of those super-spontaneous,

202
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:03,276
really strange day.

203
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:06,154
Yes, it shows.
- Yes.

204
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:11,989
Nice, although we have not
all the same size, but ...

205
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:15,701
Voilà!

206
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:20,672
The newest
Ladies Lumberjack Couture.

207
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:24,005
I've never been about me
enjoyed a checkered shirt.

208
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:28,426
I am so dead.

209
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:55,162
Uh, you like chamomile?
- Oh yeah! Mainly warm.

210
00:13:56,669 --> 00:14:01,004
So, this is the guest room and
Tomorrow we'll look at your car.

211
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:02,835
Thank you.
- Gladly.

212
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:08,466
It is wonderful
here. Do you live alone?

213
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:11,135
With Brudy and now with you.

214
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:17,847
This is the administrator hut
for a larger property.

215
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:21,354
Have you heard of the pine Hills?
- Fir Hills.

216
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,818
Yes, the name sounds familiar.

217
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:27,440
Evan Tannehill is
been a long time senator.

218
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:30,446
Yes exactly. Of course.

219
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:32,699
And that was his refuge.

220
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:36,578
But now it's the
Hut of the administrator.

221
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:37,825
Correct.

222
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,293
The property is a
half a mile from here.

223
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:45,041
Which means you are ...
- I am the administrator of your evening.

224
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:48,047
Well then.

225
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,005
Mh, what is it?

226
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:55,801
Uh, that's nothing.

227
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:57,894
Only so stuff.

228
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,480
Okay.

229
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:03,271
The "nothing" but sees
as half a novel from.

230
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,069
Good night.

231
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:24,879
Good morning, "Only Ben and Brudy".

232
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:27,545
Good morning, snow bride.

233
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:29,793
Snow Bride!

234
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:32,088
Well, clearly, because uh ...

235
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:34,799
Too early?

236
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,472
Humor is the best form of revenge.

237
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,560
No, not so the saying goes.

238
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:40,896
Now.

239
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:42,856
I was in your car.

240
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:45,813
Have great hingekriegt.

241
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:47,603
Stirs no longer from the spot.

242
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,525
Not until the tow truck is here.

243
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,944
And how do we do that without a telephone?

244
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:55,410
Um, I have to anyway in the main house.

245
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:57,279
We can call from there.

246
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,656
Are you hungry?
- A little bit already.

247
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:01,625
Let's see what I've got.

248
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:05,204
I have bacon. Den or nothing.

249
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:08,423
Bacon, yes. I am quite clear for the bacon.
- Good.

250
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,803
What do you do for a living?

251
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,214
Let's call it re-orientation.

252
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:17,557
Ah, fits to what
happened yesterday.

253
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,596
Oh yeah. That.

254
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:23,018
How are you now? With the thing.

255
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,896
I just can not feel anything.

256
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:31,614
I was once almost engaged. I can
imagine how you are doing.

257
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,816
What happened?

258
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,779
It was not,
what they seemed.

259
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,923
Oh, Benjamin, I see a yes that you

260
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:00,676
you for your top-secret
Project in which you work,

261
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,518
foreclose from the outside world have.
- I have to.

262
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:06,140
I just hope that the phone
has now been repaired.

263
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,891
Phones are a distraction.

264
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:11,441
Phones facilitate
Communication over long distances

265
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,438
considerably for older men,

266
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:16,533
trudging through the snow
need to make a fully ...

267
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:20,996
... To deliver simple message.

268
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:24,708
Sorry, Peters. The
Loneliness was helpful.

269
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:27,828
Wonderful. Your Mother
would like to know, when did they

270
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:30,001
and your brother brunch beehrst.

271
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,757
Is Jared here?
- He's on the way.

272
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:38,593
I'm in an hour above.
- Fantastic.

273
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,973
Oh, uh, there's a razor
in the bathroom commode.

274
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:46,555
Thank Peters.

275
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:07,034
Apparently "Only Ben"
not the caretaker.

276
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:11,668
The caretaker is
Peters, who was level with me.

277
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:16,252
Sometimes I live in his hut.

278
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:20,260
Although actually
anyway my family belongs.

279
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:24,476
So you are actually ...

280
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:26,970
Ben Tannehill.

281
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:34,228
Excuse me, that I
You've duped.

282
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:40,447
It was nice for a
While "Only Ben" to be.

283
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:50,752
So much for bacon.

284
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,672
Is okay. Do not worry.

285
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:57,334
You know what? Coming
You to the house with me.

286
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,466
Eat only once and then
call the towing service.

287
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:15,978
Mom?

288
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:18,484
Peters?

289
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,192
Hello?

290
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,871
Well, wait here. I search.
- Okay.

291
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,456
Okay.

292
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:43,592
Where are you?

293
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,323
Excuse me, miss?

294
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:08,826
Can I help you?

295
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,957
You are Maggie Tannehill.

296
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:12,538
Yes.

297
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,169
Do you have something delivered?

298
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,665
What delivered?
- A package for me?

299
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,292
Peters receives the packets.
- Oh, no, I ...

300
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:23,796
Precisely. Peters, I've just ...

301
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:26,215
Has Peters here simply
leave? How strange.

302
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,216
Mom!
- Ben!

303
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:32,179
But that was also the time that you
get out come back out of your hole.

304
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,931
You are shaved! You Can not See
more like a protester.

305
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,980
Hello Brudy! Come, let's hug you.

306
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:39,523
Mom, you let him much
go through too much.

307
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:42,238
Of course. Let it go the way:

308
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:45,200
Your brother and his mysterious
Guest are every minute here.

309
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,363
Mysterious guest?

310
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,862
Yes. Jared has this morning
called and said,

311
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:52,582
He has someone there and
we will be surprised.

312
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:56,833
Jared and his guest
have just arrived.

313
00:20:57,715 --> 00:20:59,206
Is she blond or blond?

314
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:01,833
Benjamin, hi. I think you ...

315
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:04,632
The holidays can
now finally start.

316
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:06,463
Boy!

317
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,599
Merry Christmas!
- Nice to see you again.

318
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:11,684
You look great!

319
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:14,771
Oh, Peter, how are you,
Sir? Nice to see you.

320
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,108
All right?
- Yes. Ben.

321
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:23,697
Listen, I've been trying you
call. I had to talk to you, but

322
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,235
your mobile phone was switched off.

323
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,108
What was there?

324
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:32,114
Hi Ben.

325
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:37,415
Claire! What a surprise,
see you again here.

326
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,208
As always a pleasure, Maggie.

327
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:44,676
Yeah, well, we, we are
run übern way to Halloween.

328
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:45,965
Halloween?

329
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:50,015
Uh, yeah. And uh, I
was in New York and uh ...

330
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:53,226
Jared just wants
say that we are together.

331
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:57,689
And for understandable
Reasons we wanted to wait

332
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:02,403
how it develops before we
so go public.

333
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,023
But I think we know now.

334
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,861
Ben, listen, I uh ...

335
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:16,158
Who are you?

336
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:20,037
Oh, yeah, um, who are you?
You have not told.

337
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:23,756
Greta Kannnnabelsteinsky.

338
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:27,048
And I am...
- My Date this weekend.

339
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:37,600
What?

340
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,348
That came spontaneously.
But I'm not spontaneous.

341
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:41,975
I am the opposite of spontaneous.

342
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:45,229
Her brother brings your ex girlfriend to
Christmas with without what to say beforehand?

343
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:48,027
I'm sorry, I'll explain that,
why you can not stay.

344
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:49,615
Hold! No!

345
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,025
No!

346
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:53,369
We do not leave the
so easily get away.

347
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:54,908
We?
- We!

348
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,999
You have saved my life. Now
I'll help you to save face.

349
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:00,494
That we can not do. Also
You have but a fiancé.

350
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:01,961
Ex-fiance.

351
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:03,959
I can not talk about it.

352
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:06,800
But I can with someone
talking, sitting in the same boat.

353
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:08,630
So far I would not go.

354
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:11,505
Okay. We are very freshly.

00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:18,936
My grandmother raised me. They
died some years ago,

358
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,054
but she still has my
Stanford's degree experienced.

00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,686
Also, I am Aries.

00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,150

366
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,320
Okay, uh, where have
we get to know?

367
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:36,370
Beverly Hills.

368
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:38,706
My car had ne Panne
and I happened to be passing.

369
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,666
That was really nice of you.
- Thank you.

370
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:42,456
Allergies?
- No. They?

371
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:44,045
Only younger brothers.

372
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,005
Where were you at the university?
- Harvard.

373
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,920
Yes of course. Sport?
- Captain.

374
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:50,294
Unbelievable!
- In Oxford I played rugby.

375
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:53,217
Hab ne scar where Niles
Jacoby Howe caught me in the scrum.

376
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:56,092
No idea what that means, but
I hope it has been disinfected.

377
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,222
Just one thing!
- What?

378
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:03,227
Christmas is, we end up
eventually under the mistletoe,

379
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:06,022
and when our first kiss
would have been, that would be suspect.

380
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:07,644
All right.

381
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:15,193
Only once by the way: I can do much better
kiss, if you do not falls upon me.

382
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:17,695
My car is no longer drove.

383
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:19,697
In Beverly Hills.
- In Beverly Hills.

384
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:22,284
And I had my phone
forget I Obertrottel.

385
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:25,958
And who came by me
saved? Captain Sonny Boy!

386
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:29,667
That's my nickname for him
because of his time at Harvard.

387
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:31,759
And we are talking about times rather
not from his Oxford Scrum.

388
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:33,503
Rugby.
- Rugby.

389
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:38,050
Oh, before I forget it: Peters
asked where he can pick up your stuff.

390
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,721
My stuff?
- Your luggage.

391
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:42,345
Not that your current wardrobe
not charming works, but

392
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:45,690
You want the surely
not kept on over the holidays.

393
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:50,734
Quite right. My luggage is
unfortunately not here.

394
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:52,606
Where is it?

395
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:54,858
At home. In Los Angeles.

396
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:57,486
In my closet. I have nothing here.

397
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,283
Nothing at all?
- No.

398
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:02,453
You know, Ben took me
completely surprised.

399
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:03,574
You could say he
just made me packed

400
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:07,291
and taken away and here I am.
- Ben?

401
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:10,416
Ben! He is so romantic and spontaneous.

402
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:13,043
This Ben?
- Yes, this Ben.

403
00:25:13,721 --> 00:25:16,885
I may not always so
been spontaneous and romantic, but

404
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:20,680
There is something about Greta,
the this site makes me.

405
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:25,263
Oh, Spatzi. You say truly
the allertollsten things.

406
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:29,977
How: do not need to pack, come
just so that we are together.

407
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:32,817
Well, then I've done.

408
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:35,903
I drive afterwards in the city to
to get a few things for tomorrow.

409
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:38,527
Maybe you want me yes
accompany and buy the bare necessities.

410
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:39,652
Oh, that would be great, thanks.

411
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:44,832
I also have a few things
I would get. I am closing in.

412
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:54,717
Over there is a nice store,
where do you get baking ingredients.

413
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:57,337
If your ambitions
you in the direction.

414
00:25:57,473 --> 00:26:00,090
As you know, Maggie, I'm in Paris

Cordon Bleu College studied.

416

00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:08,815
But my grandma and I have to
Christmas always baked gingerbread.

418
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,852
Gingerbread would be just what we
children can make you happy.

419
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,228
Children?

420
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:14,312

Biscuits in the Charity Bazaar.

00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:18,612
You remember?

00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:22,283
I associate only good feelings
with my time in your family.

00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,326
The impression I also. Okay, ladies.

433
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:01,154
That part is really important:

434
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:04,279
No one may look at except me.

435
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:07,031
But Miss, that's the exhibit.
It takes one and a half days ...

436
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:09,659
I can not but
wait one and a half days.

437
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:12,287
Listen...

00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,252

All right. I bring you this.

00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:24,929
No no no. Still
none is engaged, but

I know who it is likely
becomes. , You're gonna Story,

443
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,596
which is unbelievable.
- Good Good!

Well then, do something
Draus, Greta. With Photos!

445
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:33,691
That I will. I wanted to tell you:

446
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:35,776
After transport would
I have the corner office.

447
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:38,692
Do not get cocky. Still
you have not the story.

448
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,440
Wes has his sources.

449
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:42,568
What kind of resources? Of the...

450
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:57,206
What are you doing here?

451
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:00,297
I'll get the Christmas decorations out.

452
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:02,963
Since when do you do that?

453
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:07,975
This is the first Christmas that Mom
wants to celebrate, since Dad died.

454
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:11,600
You're not the only one,
the family meaning.

455
00:28:13,984 --> 00:28:15,976
Are you now the whole
Week mad at me?

456
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,694
Well, who hath the
fired the first shot?

457
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:22,195
The with Claire but is not
Game. She is my girlfriend.

458
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:24,818
And my ex, Jared.
- That's more than a year ago.

459
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:27,862
Did you not yet over?
Is that Greta only to distraction?

460
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:30,331
It's not about here
Greta and you know that.

461
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:32,246
It's about respect.

462
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:36,003
With Claire I was almost engaged.

463
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:39,044
And to drag here
without us warn,

464
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:41,543
that's really disrespectful,
opposite me and Mom.

465
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:43,419
This is the small family-multiplication tables.

466
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:46,298
And even someone who is so selfish
as you, the would have to actually buckle.

467
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,470
Oh, the number again, yes?

468
00:28:48,602 --> 00:28:51,015
Is that Ben is back, the
Holy and Jared, the Selfish?

469
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:53,729
Just stop being selfish,
then they call you no longer like that.

470
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:01,525
Hey boys! Listens to!

471
00:29:04,368 --> 00:29:05,904
How old are you?
- 34th

472
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:08,073
And you? How old?
- Much younger.

473
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:11,664
In any case, old enough to not more
falling into such childish patterns.

474
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,412
We have Christmas.

475
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:16,377
You two know yet exactly,
what it means to me this hard.

476
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:17,666
After what has happened.

477
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:19,255
I'm sorry, Mom.
- Me too.

478
00:29:19,383 --> 00:29:21,124
This is not a competition.
- I'm just, I'm sorry.

479
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:25,254
Stop at last! Okay, all
both. Rauf in your room.

480
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:30,300
Has now really your
Mother sent to your room?

481
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,138
Sexy, eh?

482
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:38,024
Am sure that Claire
you still find sexy.

483
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:40,397
Claire?
- Jap.

484
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:42,737
When I with you and your
Mother was traveling,

485
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,776
it has behaved,
like I'm competing.

486
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:47,116
But not in competition
Contest of the daughters.

487
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,110
She still likes you.

488
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,988
They like the idea,
to be a Tannehill.

489
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:53,327
I do not know.

490
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:57,543
She has a while she stares
at you as if you were Santa Claus.

491
00:29:57,671 --> 00:30:01,711
Greta! I have your purchases
found in the living room.

492
00:30:01,842 --> 00:30:03,674
The You could have
do not have to bring up.

493
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:05,551
Oh, no no no. Absolutely fine.

494
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,261
Should I do something with it?

495
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:09,471
Bring to my room, yes.

496
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:12,683
But this is yet
You and Ben's room.

497
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,431
Or?

498
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:17,021
Of course it is. Thank you, Peter.

499
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:18,765
Yes, because it's good.

500
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,236
Do you have anything else?

501
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,526
Yes, thank you.
- Good!

502
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:33,324
I sleep on the floor.
- I'll take the couch.

503
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:35,164
How so? Take now the bed.
- Then I'll take the floor.

504
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:36,783
Why the ground? Take the bed!

505
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,952
Fine, I'll take the bed.
- I'll take the couch.

506
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:46,876
You take the flour, which sprinkle on
Brett and then rollst the dough in it.

507
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:49,800
The flour on the board.
Then roll out the dough.

508
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:55,392
But you have not so much flour
sprinkle on the board. - Too much?

509
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,186
Spread now?
- Yes.

510
00:30:57,314 --> 00:31:00,182
Okay.

511
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:03,560
Not too thin. How so,
crumbles at the ends?

512
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:07,025
Maybe, maybe you need to ...
- I'm really overwhelmed.

513
00:31:07,157 --> 00:31:09,740
Can you please show me?
- Yes okay.

514
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:13,327
So how does it work?
- Okay, so maybe you can even ...

515
00:31:13,455 --> 00:31:17,074
Yes. From the inside to the outside. Then there is ...
- Outward? Show me.

Yes. evenly everywhere.

Oh, hey, Jared. All right?

519
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:30,216
This smells so full well
here. What are you doing?

520
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:33,135
We have a couple of degrees
finished. Want to try?

521
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,262
Yes.
- Here.

522
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,386
Thank Greta.

523
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,398
N / A?
- Tastes good, eh?

524
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:45,314
Yes!
- And here ...

525
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:49,405
ne bag icing,
If you want to help us.

526
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:51,066
Should I really?

527
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:52,692
I trust you.

528
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:58,205
Simply press?
- You have to keep it a little flatter.

529
00:31:58,333 --> 00:31:59,949
So?

530
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:02,126
I'll show you.

531
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:08,087
You pressing them up together ...

532
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:10,376
Then you think you nice and flat,

533
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:14,471
then dosing is totally easy.

534
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:17,975
Do you see? Try it.

535
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:20,303
Where did you learn that?

536
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:22,476
They showed me the degree.

537
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:24,603
But with you it smells delicious.

538
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:27,185
The secret ingredients of Grandma's recipe.

539
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,401
What is the secret?

540
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:31,147
I tell no secrets.
- White pepper and cardamom.

541
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,526
That's what happens when you let me help.
- No!

542
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:43,418
Biscuits! I find so sweet.

543
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:47,209
As you can see, I am the
Master on the sugar bag.

544
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,957
If you want, I'll help
you with your gingerbread house.

545
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:51,509
Gingerbread house?

546
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,343
Do not you have time for it?

547
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:56,886
I planned out everything. If
it all lies in bed afterwards nice

548
00:32:57,017 --> 00:32:58,679
and I me me
may focus,

549
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:02,804
then I'll build you a gingerbread house,
of which you will be thrilled.

550
00:33:03,273 --> 00:33:04,684
The kids will surely love it.

551
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:05,932
Where are we going tomorrow?

552
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:09,026
We make a Charity Bazaar
for children from poor households.

553
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:11,646
This is a tradition in the pine Hills.

554
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:15,071
Being in politics is also a
Tannehill tradition. Is it true, Ben?

555
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:20,572
Ben has told you about his plans,
to be the next Tannehill Governor?

556
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:23,161
Not if Jared is faster.

557
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:26,168
Why is that funny?

558
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:29,580
Well, you're a stockbroker.

559
00:33:32,052 --> 00:33:33,338
And?

560
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:38,055
Because stockbrokers are not politicians.

561
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:40,970
Should they perhaps.

562
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:43,560
To follow his heart,
is the most important.

563
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:27,354
What are you doing there?

564
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:31,108
I'm sorry. It lay there ...

565
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:33,352
Because you thought you read the times?

566
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:35,696
That's really good.
- But that's private.

567
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,534
You like it?
- I've read a few lines, but

568
00:34:40,662 --> 00:34:42,904
you notice immediately that it is good.

569
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:45,156
Ben, you're talented genuine.

570
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:46,791
Thank you.

571
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:50,748
Ne love story.

572
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:54,624
I would have thought a politician writes
rather what Historical or Political.

573
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,296
I am not a politician.

574
00:34:56,428 --> 00:35:01,014
Well, I thought you
Career doing. Just like your father.

575
00:35:01,141 --> 00:35:02,848
Yes, that is expected of me.

576
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,392
But you do not want.

577
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,512
The fir Hills are
no writer.

578
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:10,355
The judges are or senators or ...
- Stockbrokers?

579
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,984
Jared may be a stockbroker. Not me.

580
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:16,399
The burden of the firstborn.

581
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:19,482
Sound ridiculous to you.

582
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:22,235
Not really ridiculous.
Rather overwhelming.

583
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,740
Is still your life, Ben.

584
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:26,865
Not your father. If you are a
Want to be a writer,

585
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,242
then you should be a writer.
- Easy to say,

586
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:31,460
if you of anyone
Accountable must.

587
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:46,426
I'm sorry, I ...

588
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:49,345
No. No, you're right.

589
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:54,188
You're the one doing me a favor.

590
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:01,987
Good night, "Only Ben".

591
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:05,327
Good Night, Snow Bride.

592
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:15,754
Here's your house, Miss.

593
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:18,215
But listen. You need to
really, the house ...

594
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:05,258
You!
- I!

595
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,677
What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

596
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:09,300
The same as you.

597
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:10,722
What have you found out?

598
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:13,220
I tell you not.

599
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:16,099
Was that you just with Ben Tannehill?

600
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,100
I tell you not.

601
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:20,193
What keeps me
from because now go in

602
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:22,654
and your web of lies
to collapse?

603
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,984
Knowing that your web of lies
then the same with collapse.

604
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,032
Nice.

605
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,787
Ceasefire.

606
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:32,865
Ceasefire.

607
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:35,663
Now fuck off.

608
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:48,089
He jumped into the carriage
and whistled the team,

609
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:51,137
since they were already flying over the valley on Tann.

610
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:54,808
But listen to his voice! Out
the distance it sounds softly.

611
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:59,772
Merry Christmas to all
and all good night.

612
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:01,860
Over!

613
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,441
Okay.

614
00:38:03,573 --> 00:38:05,485
Who wants to play football?
- Here, let me!

615
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:06,983
Well, then go!

616
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:10,327
And off!

617
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:35,261
You did well. Always
remember: high on the body.

618
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:36,557
Exactly, good!

619
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,768
Thank you, Mr. Tannehill.
- Tell Ben to me quietly.

620
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,766
I look next week
Let's see how you make yourself, yes?

621
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:42,643
Thank you.
- Good.

622
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:45,984
See you.
- Yes!

623
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:50,909
Ben Tannehill.

624
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:52,820
Nice guy.

625
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:54,533
That surprise you?

626
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:57,787
Since I runtergekullert the hill
am, everything was a surprise.

627
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:02,830
Yes, you already have with
talked to him? With Al?

628
00:39:03,216 --> 00:39:04,206
No.

629
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,834
You sure you do not by
House need to clarify things?

630
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:08,381
Jup.

631
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,922
By the way: The sweater suits you.

632
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:13,139
How did it go?

633
00:39:13,268 --> 00:39:15,851
Fantastic!
More than 2,000 dollars.

634
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:19,768
Jared has probably at my
Gingerbread house offered something too much.

635
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:21,106
Oh really?

636
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,233
How was the storytelling?

637
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:24,897
Ben makes it wonderful.

638
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:28,147
Ben is a born storyteller.
- Yes, I remember.

639
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:30,650
Are you writing still
these little short stories?

640
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:31,741
Short stories?

641
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,702
Yes, as Ben and I were together,

642
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:37,073
because it has pretty small
Stories written.

643
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:40,414
And then he said that he
times would be a writer.

644
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:42,161
Really?
- Claire.

645
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:45,206
Sorry. I'll get it shortly.

646
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,423
Hey!
- Did the stain out anything?

647
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:52,133
The patch is out!

648
00:39:52,265 --> 00:39:55,053
Thank-you! Again one less worry.

649
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:57,972
You can `t imagine,
What is this for a stress.

650
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:00,437
The caterer has the
Audacity to deliver large shrimp,

651
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:01,931
instead of jumbo shrimp.

652
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,807
As if to me so what
Would miss the obvious.

653
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:06,944
I'm sorry, I have to tell you ...
- Uncle Paden flirting with Kevin's mother!

654
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:09,279
Okay, no, I'll call you back.

655
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:12,987
I am so dead.

656
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:16,325
Can I ask you for a
Moment kidnap? Sorry.

657
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:20,374
So the dress is still in
the cottage for airing. Peters ...

658
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,584
Can not see it.
- Bingo. Well, let's go.

659
00:40:22,712 --> 00:40:24,874
I can not go.
Raffle for the children.

660
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:27,339
Okay, then I'll go. Key please.

661
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:30,217
The snow is melting. You
get your car back safe.

662
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:31,802
Honest!

663
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,137
Good.

664
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,424
R is back, yes?

665
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:39,726
I have briefly gone, sorry.

666
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:16,346
No!

667
00:41:49,966 --> 00:41:51,673
What are you searching for here?

668
00:41:54,554 --> 00:41:55,635
I'm sorry.

669
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:58,672
The I take.
- The really am so sorry.

670
00:41:58,808 --> 00:42:01,551
I did not want to disrespect
be. I just wanted what,

671
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:03,848
and I forgot it here.
I am really sorry.

672
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:05,812
A wedding dress perhaps?

673
00:42:06,149 --> 00:42:08,436
You know where it is, yes?

674
00:42:08,985 --> 00:42:10,692
Can you give me maybe
recommend ne cleaning?

675
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,943
Have you and married Ben secretly?
- No!

676
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:18,784
No no no! We
do not know each other.

677
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:24,990
They only do so?

678
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:26,242
It was spontaneous.

679
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:29,620
Normally it is not spontaneous,
but because Jared and Claire ...

680
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,164
The charade has to stop.

681
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,292
Oh no. No no no.

682
00:42:34,427 --> 00:42:36,794
Also remember Maggie. They
is quite fond of you.

683
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,382
Really?

684
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:40,801
Yeah, me too of her.

685
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:43,722
You know, all are much nicer,
as I've imagined.

686
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:48,814
You said you know nothing about
the family, they are stumbled.

687
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:53,652
That's right. Yes, just as it was.

688
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:56,314
Something you conceal me.

689
00:42:58,201 --> 00:43:00,318
The same could I
said about you.

690
00:43:00,453 --> 00:43:02,820
What do you mean?
- The letters.

691
00:43:14,884 --> 00:43:17,797
Maggie and I have known
since our youth.

692
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:21,050
In the Unizeit we
lost sight of each other.

693
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,967
I have Evan on his first election campaign
helped when his wife walked through the door.

694
00:43:26,646 --> 00:43:28,182
It was Maggie.

695
00:43:28,648 --> 00:43:30,264
You love them.

696
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:32,065
No.

697
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:39,403
After death we felt Evans
us another very connected.

698
00:43:39,534 --> 00:43:44,029
But I thought it would be more appropriate
only the managers to stay.

699
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:48,616
Evan was like a brother.

700
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:53,586
They tell nothing about it.

701
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:55,296
Never.

702
00:43:56,801 --> 00:43:59,794
Tell Ben and me
Chance to solve this problem alone.

703
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:02,804
We will make it.
- Fast!

704
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:06,137
Quick.
- All right.

705
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:14,434
All I want, Miss
Kanenablesteinsky is that ...

706
00:44:14,569 --> 00:44:17,437
Keep in mind the consequences,

707
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:20,230
on feelings show consideration.

708
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:23,821
Good.

709
00:44:30,126 --> 00:44:32,209
Hey.
- Hey.

710
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:37,207
I'm sorry about earlier. I
wanted because of your writing

711
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:40,049
no problems between
your mom and you produce.

712
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:44,550
Did not you.
- Good.

713
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:48,429
Really, that's the
last thing I want.

714
00:44:51,147 --> 00:44:53,264
Ben, you have a moment?

715
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:55,690
Yes.

716
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:01,146
I do not know how that happened.

717
00:45:01,282 --> 00:45:04,366
He's like a mixture of
Butler Carson and Obi Wan Kenobi.

718
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:06,109
He questioned me and
I confessed everything.

719
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:09,204
As in the finale of a
Law-and-order sequence or so.

720
00:45:09,332 --> 00:45:11,415
You told him everything?
- Yes.

721
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:14,042
Then I have to talk about it with my mom.
- Oh no. Do not you have to.

722
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:16,787
Peters has promised that
He will not tell her anything.

723
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:18,872
How did you attempt it?

724
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:20,291
I have my methods.

725
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:23,715
But now everything's cool and apologize,
that I can squeeze myself.

726
00:45:24,222 --> 00:45:25,463
Is okay.

727
00:45:26,057 --> 00:45:28,049
When Jared and I had earlier dispute,

728
00:45:28,184 --> 00:45:31,097
Mom Peters has commissioned,
find out the real reason.

729
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:32,185
Not your dad?

730
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:37,024
No. He was always at work.

731
00:45:38,194 --> 00:45:40,356
Did he ever your
Read short stories?

732
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:43,237
No.

733
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:49,536
I've never shown it.

734
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:04,171
Are you sure?
- Not at all.

735
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:07,129
Do not stop you.

736
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:29,531
Are you enjoying your undercover life
among the rich and famous?

737
00:46:29,662 --> 00:46:32,871
They're not the way I thought
hab. Of course, they are rich,

738
00:46:32,999 --> 00:46:34,331
but they are also nice.

739
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:35,498
I beg your pardon?

740
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:36,787
Wait a minute short.

741
00:46:40,256 --> 00:46:41,087
Okay, continue.

742
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:44,674
Did you just using the word "nice" the
Characterizes object of your investigation?

743
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:45,883
Yes I have.

744
00:46:46,012 --> 00:46:49,426
And I feel now
even guilty. And nasty.

745
00:46:49,557 --> 00:46:52,265
Do I need a SWAT team
Send to ensure that you get out there?

746
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:55,682
I am serious. American
Adel, but I find the all super.

747
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:57,770
So, no wild orgies?

748
00:46:57,898 --> 00:46:59,514
No. Pastries and Football.

749
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,687
And not because of PR,
but for the most deprived.

750
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:03,651
That we can participate in our
Not use newspaper.

751
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:05,520
You're right. That's just sweet.

752
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:07,568
Because somewhere a hook must be.

753
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,316
Usually already.

754
00:47:10,453 --> 00:47:11,569
We listen to.

755
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:32,847
Hey!
- Hey!

756
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:35,809
Your car is now
fully fueled and repaired.

757
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:37,765
Ah, you're great. Thank you.

758
00:47:37,897 --> 00:47:41,140
Or should I prefer you not
Give getaway car while you are reading?

759
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:43,688
What?

760
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:44,900
No.

761
00:47:45,029 --> 00:47:47,817
I just want to know whether the two
come together after all these years.

762
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:50,698
Is this...

763
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:54,361
too cheesy?

764
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:58,039
Ben, that's really good.

765
00:47:58,626 --> 00:48:02,791
One does not expect a guy like you
good love stories are written, but ...

766
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:16,929
Ben, you're really talented.

767
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:18,802
And it would be a shame,
if you throw away the,

768
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:20,720
just about any
To meet expectations.
769
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:48,290
Had I the
Christmas Ball mentioned?

770
00:48:48,426 --> 00:48:50,964
Christmas ... No, you did not.

771
00:48:51,095 --> 00:48:52,336
There is a Christmas ball.

772
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:53,712
When?
- Today.

773
00:48:53,848 --> 00:48:56,261
What?
- It's really not a big deal.

774
00:48:56,392 --> 00:48:58,850
It's Moms Charity Ball.

775
00:48:58,978 --> 00:49:00,765
I think that's a mega big deal!

776
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:03,680
Yes, you are right.

777
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:05,894
But I did nothing to put on.

778
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:07,142
Precisely.

779
00:49:07,278 --> 00:49:10,737
This is perhaps
somewhat presumptuous, but ...

780
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:14,987
when I was just now in the city, have
I a little bit shopped for you.

781
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:19,328
Nothing special. Only a few clothes.

782
00:49:19,457 --> 00:49:21,949
Available in various sizes.

783
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:24,492
And shoes.

784
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:27,628
Also available in different sizes.

785
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:29,539
Ben.

786
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:33,009
What you do not like, can
you bring back, that's okay.

787
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:39,133
That's the least I can do,
after what you've done for me.

788
00:49:42,188 --> 00:49:44,726
You are the one that is here great, Greta.

789
00:50:19,642 --> 00:50:20,428
Thank you.

790
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,277
You look gorgeous!

791
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:37,865
Thank you.

792
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:40,360
Ben, we go!

793
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:43,242
Sorry. Ll be right there.

794
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:01,635
You look amazing.

795
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:04,266
You too.

796
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:07,558
May I?

797
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:16,146
Thank-you.

798
00:51:48,689 --> 00:51:49,850
Let's drink something.

799
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,061
I'll be right back.

800
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:11,535
Her dress is really stunning.

801
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:14,083
But you must also
not just hide. - Thank you.

802
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:15,955
Here's someone breathtaking.

803
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:20,001
Why do not you ask them?

804
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:22,379
No no no.
- Do you think she does not want to dance?

805
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:25,177
I can not...
- With her friend from his youth?

806
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:32,313
Well, when you put it like this, then ...

807
00:52:32,441 --> 00:52:34,899
no longer it sounds
so terrifying.

808
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:39,229
Is my tie?

809
00:52:39,365 --> 00:52:41,106
Nothing to complain about.

810
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:55,791
They have a Christmas school?

811
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:58,547
Yes indeed. Between
Roxburgh and Wooden Elms.

812
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:01,801
Wooden Elms. Really interesting.

813
00:53:02,388 --> 00:53:04,004
I have to go.

814
00:53:10,646 --> 00:53:12,638
You!
- Yes I!

815
00:53:12,773 --> 00:53:14,264
Stalkst you about me?

816
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:19,602
No, I Stalke my story.

817
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:21,570
Which story? No one is engaged.

818
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:26,944
Jared Tannehill drags his ex
Brother as his new girlfriend to?

819
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:30,038
Come on. That's a story.
- Yes, an old.

820
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:31,451
Inform you, Wes.

821
00:53:33,252 --> 00:53:34,788
This is not your color.

822
00:53:41,969 --> 00:53:43,551
Everything okay with you?

823
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:47,714
But already! I believe,
I've lost something.

824
00:53:48,434 --> 00:53:50,300
But how do you do that?
- Very good. Thanks for asking.

825
00:53:50,436 --> 00:53:54,851
Nice. Who is the man with
the lady has spoken degrees?

826
00:53:54,982 --> 00:53:57,725
Oh, the little man with the
Mustache? A reporter.

827
00:53:57,860 --> 00:54:00,477
I think he is
Reporter. From "Gossip Pulse".

828
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:03,025
He sneaks around here and asking questions.

829
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:06,032
Thank you.

830
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:25,464
Hey! Greta.

831
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:29,047
Who is the man with whom you grade yourself
hast entertained? Apparently, you know each other.

832
00:54:29,558 --> 00:54:31,390
A guy who after
Men's room has been looking for.

833
00:54:34,146 --> 00:54:38,481
You may think, just because you Ben
did you ever sit in the front row.

834
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:40,976
But that's just your
temporary space.

835
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:43,269
You have to know.

836
00:54:43,864 --> 00:54:44,695
Excuse me.

837
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:12,052
Now just relax some games.

838
00:55:12,184 --> 00:55:14,392
Yes.
- Very loose. I do not bite already.

839
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,011
Now already say what you
ask me wanted.

840
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:24,440
What exactly do you know about Greta
Kanee as always, also called.

841
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,822
What makes you think that?

842
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:30,157
Only from curiosity.

843
00:55:32,621 --> 00:55:34,237
That does not concern you, Claire.

844
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,491
I do think that
what that concerns me.

845
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:42,874
Your family is important to me, Ben.

846
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:45,377
I've missed you.

847
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:49,169
And I did not know how much,
until I had seen you again.

848
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:55,300
Sorry.

849
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:04,225
Can I borrow my girlfriend?

850
00:56:05,654 --> 00:56:06,644
Sure, of course.

851
00:56:22,588 --> 00:56:23,624
Maestro!

852
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:31,047
Claire.

853
00:56:32,306 --> 00:56:34,798
You're the most amazing woman,
I've ever met.

854
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:38,226
You're beautiful, and you're smart.

855
00:56:39,313 --> 00:56:43,432
You're the woman all night
a gingerbread house for children bakes.

856
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:52,399
And I know that maybe for
some may come somewhat surprising.

857
00:56:53,327 --> 00:56:54,909
But not for me.

858
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:02,291
Claire Palmer Sinclaire.

859
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:06,789
Would you honor me the
prove to be my wife?

860
00:57:12,054 --> 00:57:13,010
Yes.

861
00:57:47,089 --> 00:57:48,705
Everything okay?

862
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,847
Dance with me.

863
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:11,902
It still hurts, right?

864
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:19,447
Not really.

865
00:58:25,085 --> 00:58:26,792
Why did you separate then?

866
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:33,549
After we had come together, stand
my name suddenly in the tabloids

867
00:58:33,677 --> 00:58:35,885
like never before.

868
00:58:36,013 --> 00:58:39,222
Also no more after separation.

869
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:41,591
Then my father died and ...

870
00:58:42,686 --> 00:58:45,895
the paparazzi rushed as the
Geier published on us and

871
00:58:46,023 --> 00:58:48,982
every private detail.

872
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:52,731
I knew it.

873
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:56,822
She just used me.

874
00:58:58,118 --> 00:59:01,782
She has used the family,
order to celebrate as a celebrity.

875
00:59:02,998 --> 00:59:05,285
Bad if you do not
know who you can trust.

876
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:13,294
Crazy, I trust you.

877
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:17,134
Ben ... - I know, I know
you do not ...

878
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:21,593
But why should I not be trusted,

879
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:25,218
so if you do something crazy,
to help someone else.

880
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:31,394
What?

881
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:34,602
You said it yourself.

882
00:59:35,447 --> 00:59:38,565
At Christmas we land
eventually under the mistletoe.

883
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:43,194
Ben!

884
01:00:02,766 --> 01:00:04,132
I'm sorry...

885
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:07,135
Greta!

886
01:01:02,284 --> 01:01:03,570
Hey.

887
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:04,946
Hello There.

888
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:07,445
Can I?
- Sure, sit down.

889
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:11,081
Is it warm enough?
- Yes, I think so.

890
01:01:13,003 --> 01:01:16,371
Did you enjoy the evening?
- Yes very. And them?

891
01:01:17,424 --> 01:01:19,381
On the whole, so, yes.

892
01:01:20,218 --> 01:01:24,053
It was nice to finally
to laugh and dance.

893
01:01:24,723 --> 01:01:27,090
It's Ben particularly important
that you can enjoy Christmas.

894
01:01:27,225 --> 01:01:29,512
You is very much about him, yes?

895
01:01:32,856 --> 01:01:34,643
He is a wonderful person.

896
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:37,145
He is not so,
as I've expected.

897
01:01:37,277 --> 01:01:39,143
Why expect?

898
01:01:39,279 --> 01:01:40,520
Well, when I met him.

899
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:43,614
I mean, now I expect
Of course just wonderful.

900
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:48,240
And that Claire is here?
Come cope with it?

901
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:52,949
Would I have to say,
but it is unusual.

902
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,496
This is still expressed softly.

903
01:01:57,422 --> 01:02:00,210
Both sons are the same
Been wife.

904
01:02:00,342 --> 01:02:02,629
And one engaged for today.

905
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:05,173
This is again a feast for the press.

906
01:02:08,808 --> 01:02:10,640
Perhaps will not be as bad.

907
01:02:10,769 --> 01:02:13,682
Not in this day and age with the
Kardashians and the rest of them.

908
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:16,681
But in contrast to those want
we no publicity.

909
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:19,149
This makes us all the more to the target.

910
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:20,688
It can be.

911
01:02:21,321 --> 01:02:22,732
But maybe you're right.

912
01:02:22,864 --> 01:02:27,575
Probably what you need yet
Deftigeres to attract attention.

913
01:02:29,871 --> 01:02:33,239
Like the fact that Claire earlier
has times angebaggert my husband.

914
01:02:33,375 --> 01:02:34,661
What? Not seriously!

915
01:02:34,793 --> 01:02:35,954
Oh but.

916
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:40,171
Well, that was years before
she and Ben were a pair.

917
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:41,830
How did you find out?

918
01:02:41,967 --> 01:02:43,048
I've seen them.

919
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:47,887
And saw how Evan
dismissed and brought to the door.

920
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:50,597
Goodbye forever
I've thought back then.

921
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:53,684
Well, that's ...
- Is hearty.

922
01:02:53,812 --> 01:02:55,644
Yes.

923
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:58,435
God, how can you just stand,
under the same roof with her ...

924
01:02:58,566 --> 01:03:00,683
Especially when...

925
01:03:01,987 --> 01:03:05,856
I think that things
always develop as they should.

926
01:03:39,441 --> 01:03:41,228
Okay, go!
- You have something?

927
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:43,772
I sent it Charlie.
My friend at Warner Books.

928
01:03:43,903 --> 01:03:45,144
Without a word to Ben?

929
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:47,818
I've used a different name.
I just want some feedback from the expert.

930
01:03:47,991 --> 01:03:50,358
I thought that if Charlie
Ben says that it is good,

931
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:53,736
then motivates him that perhaps that
Writing to pursue serious.

932
01:03:53,872 --> 01:03:56,205
You lose when all your cheating
someday the overview.

933
01:03:56,333 --> 01:03:58,666
Do a Flowchart.
- Is really bad, right?

934
01:03:58,793 --> 01:03:59,909
Not in our industry.

935
01:04:00,045 --> 01:04:02,378
That makes it somehow worse.

936
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:03,541
Wait a moment.

937
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:06,794
This is Doria.

938
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:09,255
I should at least one
Create half-truth from the world.

939
01:04:09,387 --> 01:04:11,845
Good luck, Boss. Let me know,
if I have to call the ambulance.

940
01:04:14,476 --> 01:04:15,683
Doria!

941
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:50,838
Is a football game.

942
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:52,711
Minnesota to Oklahoma.

943
01:04:53,181 --> 01:04:55,969
We can switch if you ...
- Oh no. I love football.

944
01:04:58,228 --> 01:05:00,094
Mag bacon and loves football.

945
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:02,767
Who are you?

946
01:05:10,323 --> 01:05:12,030
How did you sleep?

947
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:15,109
Quite well.

948
01:05:17,122 --> 01:05:19,239
And you?
- Quite well.

949
01:05:21,793 --> 01:05:23,500
Have your snoring missing.

950
01:05:25,797 --> 01:05:27,129
Did yours also missing.

951
01:05:28,508 --> 01:05:30,670
I do not snore yet!
- Yes, you do.

952
01:05:30,802 --> 01:05:33,590
No, I do not. You're snoring!

953
01:05:33,721 --> 01:05:37,590
Did you like this about not been said?
- As a truck driver.

954
01:05:46,317 --> 01:05:47,353
Hi.

955
01:05:49,112 --> 01:05:50,148
Hi.

956
01:05:54,742 --> 01:05:56,699
You are so Beautiful.

957
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:05,121
I have to say what, Ben you.

958
01:06:07,255 --> 01:06:08,211
It's really important.

959
01:06:08,339 --> 01:06:10,001
Now you cut me, you two.

960
01:06:10,133 --> 01:06:11,795
I'll quite red.

961
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:15,382
I know, otherwise there's other
Knabberkram for Football, but ...

962
01:06:16,097 --> 01:06:17,804
That cost me a lot of money.
- This has probably.

963
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:20,182
And there is something to eat,
no work of art, so ...

964
01:06:20,310 --> 01:06:21,596
Here.
- Thank-you.

965
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:25,099
Maybe it's art.

966
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:26,563
That was a piece of my Veneer.

967
01:06:26,691 --> 01:06:28,523
I think that was two
Months in the shop window.

968
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:30,643
Oh, you eat the house already?
- No!

969
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:32,523
Is my Veneer okay?

970
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:34,396
How should I know that?
- Watch for times.

971
01:06:34,532 --> 01:06:35,943
Show me.

972
01:06:36,075 --> 01:06:37,657
I guess so.

973
01:06:38,203 --> 01:06:39,785
Ho, the game!

974
01:06:41,122 --> 01:06:43,785
OK honey. I do not know,
What did you put there,

975
01:06:43,917 --> 01:06:44,873
but it tastes like ne beltway.

976
01:06:45,793 --> 01:06:47,159
Please listen to me.

977
01:06:47,295 --> 01:06:49,662
There is important news,
I have to tell you.

978
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:54,796
It gives me no joy,
To be the bearer of such messages.

979
01:06:54,969 --> 01:06:56,881
But you were all lied to.

980
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:02,140
That woman is a spy.

981
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:04,639
You mean, she works for the CIA?

982
01:07:04,771 --> 01:07:07,684
No, not like ne
real spy-spy.

983
01:07:07,815 --> 01:07:09,807
She's a reporter.

984
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:12,435
For "Gossip Pulse".

985
01:07:12,737 --> 01:07:15,400
She's with us
crept to spy on us

986
01:07:15,532 --> 01:07:18,195
and to write a Tannehill story.

987
01:07:18,743 --> 01:07:21,360
That is quite a charge.
- She has

988
01:07:21,496 --> 01:07:26,582
on the children's festival and on the
Ball entertain with the same man.

989
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:30,669
I discovered,
that the man was a reporter

990
01:07:30,797 --> 01:07:33,130
and myself have done a little research.

991
01:07:33,258 --> 01:07:37,673
And I found out,
that Greta Kane ...

992
01:07:37,804 --> 01:07:40,968
in truth is a gossip reporter.

993
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:43,807
Yes, but she is the girlfriend of Ben.

994
01:07:44,852 --> 01:07:47,720
Ben, please. I can...
- No. She's not my girlfriend.

995
01:07:50,817 --> 01:07:51,933
Please, I just wanted to ...

996
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:53,809
This was all just a lie.

997
01:07:57,198 --> 01:08:00,236
Our first encounter,
your stay here,

998
01:08:00,368 --> 01:08:01,529
everything played.

999
01:08:01,661 --> 01:08:03,869
All because you my ex-girlfriend
anschleppst here without warning.

1000
01:08:03,997 --> 01:08:05,033
I tried to call.

1001
01:08:05,164 --> 01:08:06,700
Your car and all that ...

1002
01:08:08,126 --> 01:08:10,368
The Snow Bride on the run,
that was all just made up?

1003
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:11,960
The car has really pinned.

1004
01:08:12,589 --> 01:08:14,876
I thought you help me
because you're a good person.

1005
01:08:15,008 --> 01:08:17,125
You wanted you only gain access.

1006
01:08:17,468 --> 01:08:18,675
Easy...

1007
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:36,527
What Claire says is true.

1008
01:08:37,363 --> 01:08:40,322
I am a reporter.

1009
01:08:41,159 --> 01:08:42,821
And I should write a story.

1010
01:08:42,994 --> 01:08:46,658
Because there was a tip that one of the
Brothers bought an engagement ring.

1011
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:49,076
Now that is also
a story about me.

1012
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:51,791
How could you hurt me so?

1013
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:54,044
I should be all
find out what I could.

1014
01:08:54,589 --> 01:08:56,421
And what did you find out?

1015
01:08:58,176 --> 01:09:03,137
That you are a family.
A wonderful family.

1016
01:09:03,264 --> 01:09:07,804
And I hired conjectures
have, just because of prejudice.

1017
01:09:10,313 --> 01:09:12,179
I was wrong.

1018
01:09:14,359 --> 01:09:18,444
I am so sorry. It
I'm so terribly sorry.

1019
01:09:20,531 --> 01:09:24,400
But I make sure that no
Story will be released upon you.

1020
01:09:26,621 --> 01:09:28,283
Not from me.

1021
01:09:31,334 --> 01:09:33,451
You've got your car keys.

1022
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:37,420
You can go now.

1023
01:09:48,643 --> 01:09:49,804
Excuse me.

1024
01:09:52,522 --> 01:09:53,729
Sorry.

1025
01:10:04,283 --> 01:10:05,774
Greta!

1026
01:10:06,244 --> 01:10:08,076
Just a sec.

1027
01:10:14,001 --> 01:10:15,617
You'd almost forgotten.

1028
01:10:17,964 --> 01:10:19,125
Thank you.

1029
01:10:19,674 --> 01:10:21,836
Drive carefully, okay?

1030
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:42,519
This is Kevin's family
not further notice.

1031
01:10:43,114 --> 01:10:45,572
It has no sleeves!
- But the stain is out.

1032
01:10:46,868 --> 01:10:47,984
Do you hate me?

1033
01:10:49,287 --> 01:10:50,653
Honestly?

1034
01:10:51,205 --> 01:10:52,696
I think it looks great!

1035
01:10:52,832 --> 01:10:54,949
Who wants to have puffed sleeves?
- Good.

1036
01:10:55,752 --> 01:10:57,459
But what is more important:

1037
01:10:57,587 --> 01:11:01,547
this dress, this love tradition,
brought you to your dream man.

1038
01:11:01,674 --> 01:11:05,964
Oh, the thinks I had lied to him
and will never speak to me again.

1039
01:11:06,596 --> 01:11:08,508
At least you're not a drama out of it.

1040
01:11:09,015 --> 01:11:11,348
Say honestly, how do you feel?

1041
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:17,680
Guilt, shame, inconsolable ...

1042
01:11:18,399 --> 01:11:22,188
But maybe that means ...
- Depressed, terribly angry ...

1043
01:11:22,361 --> 01:11:24,569
I understand that totally.
- Lonely,

1044
01:11:24,697 --> 01:11:28,190
sad, frustrated ...

1045
01:11:29,494 --> 01:11:33,659
Wistful, nervous public.

1046
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:35,577
Now repeat do not permanently.

1047
01:11:36,584 --> 01:11:38,746
Have you tried calling him?
- No.

1048
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:41,207
Or tried to reach him otherwise?

1049
01:11:41,339 --> 01:11:43,296
What do I mean?
Even more humiliating?

1050
01:11:43,424 --> 01:11:45,962
Maybe he missed you
exactly as you miss him.

1051
01:11:46,886 --> 01:11:49,344
His phone works.
And he did not call me.

1052
01:11:49,472 --> 01:11:51,714
Does not sound like
he'd miss me.

1053
01:12:33,474 --> 01:12:35,215
Do not be mad at me, Ben.

1054
01:12:41,732 --> 01:12:44,315
I had the truth
find out about Greta,

1055
01:12:47,822 --> 01:12:51,486
because I still
Have feelings for you.

1056
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:55,277
I have done everything for love.

1057
01:13:02,253 --> 01:13:03,539
I love you, Ben.

1058
01:13:08,134 --> 01:13:09,420
Love?

1059
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:14,796
Yes love.

1060
01:13:16,434 --> 01:13:20,098
Are we completely interchangeable for you?

1061
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:22,437
You're engaged to my brother.

1062
01:13:22,982 --> 01:13:26,020
Yes, but that was, that was a mistake.
I should never have to say "Yes".

1063
01:13:26,152 --> 01:13:27,814
I was in a panic.

1064
01:13:30,573 --> 01:13:33,065
Ben, you're there. You
are there always has been.

1065
01:13:35,828 --> 01:13:38,787
Just because my father
did not want to play.

1066
01:13:42,126 --> 01:13:44,869
And to be clear, Claire,

1067
01:13:46,714 --> 01:13:48,956
I also do not play with.

1068
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:52,797
Please go. Immediately.

1069
01:13:53,846 --> 01:13:57,385
For I am Jared now
Tell the truth. The whole truth.

1070
01:13:57,516 --> 01:13:59,303
And when I did that,

1071
01:14:00,061 --> 01:14:04,180
then is your last chance,
to be a Tannehill past.

1072
01:14:05,858 --> 01:14:07,474
Forever.

1073
01:14:18,746 --> 01:14:19,987
Seriously?

1074
01:14:20,998 --> 01:14:23,331
You can not
simply run away from me.

1075
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:25,325
We have been through so much together.

1076
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:28,044
And I have yet so much done for you!

1077
01:14:28,506 --> 01:14:30,418
But that's the problem.

1078
01:14:33,803 --> 01:14:35,510
I hate you!

1079
01:14:36,097 --> 01:14:37,929
You said degree, you love me.

1080
01:14:38,057 --> 01:14:40,640
And you're my brother
engaged. So what now?

1081
01:14:40,768 --> 01:14:42,600
That's a good question.

1082
01:14:42,812 --> 01:14:44,474
Oh, shut up!

1083
01:14:44,689 --> 01:14:46,772
You are together with me,
to obliterate him one.

1084
01:14:46,899 --> 01:14:49,357
I would never a
Stockbroker married.

1085
01:14:52,571 --> 01:14:54,608
I'll call a cab.

1086
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:16,093
I would sooner what to say.

1087
01:15:19,974 --> 01:15:21,306
No, how did you should know

1088
01:15:21,434 --> 01:15:24,472
I fall in love with your ex
and then as a show depart.

1089
01:15:25,521 --> 01:15:27,012
It is not your fault.

1090
01:15:27,815 --> 01:15:29,977
We never find in life.

1091
01:15:32,653 --> 01:15:34,519
Keep looking.

1092
01:15:36,866 --> 01:15:41,531
Do you remember when we were little,
We were looking for reindeer tracks.

1093
01:15:42,288 --> 01:15:44,029
Yes. And when we had found that,

1094
01:15:45,291 --> 01:15:47,123
... That was real Christmas magic.

1095
01:15:47,251 --> 01:15:49,083
Could we use now.

1096
01:15:49,587 --> 01:15:50,953
In any case.

1097
01:15:59,972 --> 01:16:01,133
You are welcome.

1098
01:16:01,474 --> 01:16:03,431
What are you doing there?

1099
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:06,434
Diamonds in the snow looking.

1100
01:16:06,812 --> 01:16:08,178
That's romantic.

1101
01:16:08,314 --> 01:16:10,522
This just came for you.

1102
01:16:11,609 --> 01:16:14,147
Sender: "Doria Dress."

1103
01:16:15,654 --> 01:16:17,111
Say that again.

1104
01:16:17,823 --> 01:16:20,816
I provide no
Information about the fir Hills.

1105
01:16:21,035 --> 01:16:23,243
That's why you went there since.
- I know.

1106
01:16:24,330 --> 01:16:27,038
You shoot your
Transport in the wind,

1107
01:16:27,166 --> 01:16:30,830
because you do not have some spoiled,
rich celebrity politicians want to report?

1108
01:16:30,961 --> 01:16:33,544
So they are not, Lou.
They are really quite nice.

1109
01:16:33,672 --> 01:16:35,129
I do not know.

1110
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:37,544
And you wanted something
earlier also do not know.

1111
01:16:38,385 --> 01:16:39,876
But now.

1112
01:16:41,472 --> 01:16:42,462
Listen.

1113
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:45,432
I know Maggie Tannehill
for over 40 years.

1114
01:16:45,559 --> 01:16:48,393
If I say, the family is
Fair game, then it's fair game.

1115
01:16:48,604 --> 01:16:50,846
Come on, Lou, why
is that so important to you?

1116
01:16:50,981 --> 01:16:53,849
Jared Tannehill wants
married, who cares?

1117
01:16:53,984 --> 01:16:56,146
That's really not a good story.

1118
01:16:57,113 --> 01:16:59,981
Is it when the same woman
the brother and the father together.

1119
01:17:00,116 --> 01:17:01,277
She had nothing to do with the father.

1120
01:17:01,408 --> 01:17:03,525
A detail.
- But an important one!

1121
01:17:03,828 --> 01:17:06,195
Now he can not
fight more against it, right?

1122
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:09,786
And this story is an instant
bombastic online Start grant.

1123
01:17:10,084 --> 01:17:11,700
That's a lie and
violates the privacy.

1124
01:17:11,836 --> 01:17:13,498
If you pull through this, I quit.

1125
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:15,712
And if you do not
by draw, then I fire you.

1126
01:17:16,507 --> 01:17:17,793
It's your decision.

1127
01:17:20,094 --> 01:17:21,756
Do you already know what you want to do?

1128
01:17:21,887 --> 01:17:23,128
No Idea.

1129
01:17:23,264 --> 01:17:25,802
But from the
Tabloids I've enough.

1130
01:17:26,267 --> 01:17:28,850
Wherever you land, you must
then please bring me to you.

1131
01:17:29,478 --> 01:17:31,219
For the duplicate content.

1132
01:17:33,232 --> 01:17:36,020
If you are already a celebrity
verfällst, then that was the right one.

1133
01:17:36,152 --> 01:17:40,442
Yes. But the thinking now, I'm the
Source and will hate me even more.

1134
01:17:40,906 --> 01:17:43,193
But who is the source?

1135
01:17:50,249 --> 01:17:52,286
The Lord, you can tell everything.
- I am anxious to hear your stories.

1136
01:17:56,130 --> 01:17:58,713
Of course.
- What do you want to do now?

1137
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:02,842
The only thing I can.

1138
01:18:17,526 --> 01:18:18,482
What do you want here?

1139
01:18:18,611 --> 01:18:21,445
Please give me five minutes.
- I gave you enough.

1140
01:18:21,572 --> 01:18:23,404
It is because of Claire.

1141
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:28,697
I do not know one hundred percent,
what they are writing,

1142
01:18:28,829 --> 01:18:31,697
But Senator Tannehill is
not good to get away under warranty.

1143
01:18:32,499 --> 01:18:34,491
You have no evidence.
- You do not need.

1144
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:37,327
Well, let's threaten halt
by legal means.

1145
01:18:37,463 --> 01:18:39,045
That would come too late.

1146
01:18:49,516 --> 01:18:51,178
Lou Blanco?

1147
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:53,726
I connect with Maggie Tannehill.

1148
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:57,018
Hey, Lou!

1149
01:18:57,691 --> 01:19:00,604
Yes, it's insanely long ago.

1150
01:19:01,362 --> 01:19:04,730
Of course I remember.
I remember everything!

1151
01:19:05,532 --> 01:19:08,696
Listen, Lou, I
got great news.

1152
01:19:08,827 --> 01:19:10,693
It's been a few days,

1153
01:19:10,829 --> 01:19:13,037
because I have my lawyers
commissioned purchasing

1154
01:19:13,165 --> 01:19:15,373
of "Pulse Gossip"
to lead in the way.

1155
01:19:15,501 --> 01:19:17,333
And our common
Girlfriend Greta Kane

1156
01:19:17,461 --> 01:19:20,420
raves in the highest
Tones of you and your team.

1157
01:19:21,966 --> 01:19:24,003
I beg your pardon?

1158
01:19:24,385 --> 01:19:26,547
She no longer works for Pulse?

1159
01:19:27,054 --> 01:19:28,841
We need to retrieve quickly.

1160
01:19:28,973 --> 01:19:33,263
I have quite a few ideas on how we
can put it in the company.

1161
01:19:33,394 --> 01:19:35,636
Oh, because I still think of one thing.

1162
01:19:36,397 --> 01:19:37,854
If my information is correct,

1163
01:19:37,982 --> 01:19:41,976
is you a story right to the
Claire Sinclaire has contributed something?

1164
01:19:43,070 --> 01:19:46,234
This is not yet in
both our interests.

1165
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:49,232
Do not you think so? Good.

1166
01:19:49,576 --> 01:19:51,317
I'll see you soon, Lou.

1167
01:19:53,831 --> 01:19:55,823
Peters had a bit of
I researched about you,

1168
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,491
After they arrived here.

1169
01:19:59,128 --> 01:20:01,415
So you have ...
- Just know who you are.

1170
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:03,337
Quasi from the outset.

1171
01:20:03,966 --> 01:20:05,252
Why did not you tell?

1172
01:20:05,384 --> 01:20:08,047
We were curious, while the
everything would develop, right?

1173
01:20:08,178 --> 01:20:09,294
Very curious.

1174
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:11,592
I've decided,
To take precautions

1175
01:20:11,724 --> 01:20:14,341
so no gossip story
published about us.

1176
01:20:14,476 --> 01:20:16,342
So you buy really
a tabloid?

1177
01:20:17,104 --> 01:20:18,436
Yes, obviously.

1178
01:20:18,564 --> 01:20:23,400
Although a small change of direction
is planned to seriöserem journalism.

1179
01:20:23,527 --> 01:20:26,941
You have me consciously
tells what Claire has done.

1180
01:20:27,072 --> 01:20:29,064
If you had tried to
For releasing information

1181
01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:31,191
I had known that we
You can not be trusted.

1182
01:20:31,327 --> 01:20:34,491
If not, does that mean
we can trust you.

1183
01:20:35,831 --> 01:20:39,450
You said you believe the things
develop as they should.

1184
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:41,167
I do.

1185
01:20:41,503 --> 01:20:43,995
But if necessary, get things
by me a little push.

1186
01:20:45,549 --> 01:20:47,791
Greta, you want to
with us for dinner?

1187
01:20:58,145 --> 01:21:00,808
Thanks, but I prefer to go.

1188
01:21:06,862 --> 01:21:08,979
I hope you do not hate me for it.

1189
01:21:39,978 --> 01:21:42,345
Greta has my novel
sent to a publisher.

1190
01:21:43,816 --> 01:21:45,148
Under an assumed name.

1191
01:21:45,818 --> 01:21:47,980
Does he like them?
- You've written a novel?

1192
01:21:49,571 --> 01:21:51,403
You want me on
talk a contract.

1193
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:53,902
Congratulations!

1194
01:21:54,118 --> 01:21:56,826
That means now so that you
will not go into politics?

1195
01:21:58,163 --> 01:22:00,871
It is, in any case, that
I have to think about a lot.

1196
01:22:00,999 --> 01:22:02,865
Such as the name.

1197
01:22:03,085 --> 01:22:05,668
Tannehill would be very good
make on a book cover.

1198
01:22:05,796 --> 01:22:07,207
You know what I mean.

1199
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:10,749
This is your dream, right?
To be a writer?

1200
01:22:10,884 --> 01:22:11,795
Yes, it is.

1201
01:22:12,803 --> 01:22:14,010
Then follow him!

1202
01:22:14,138 --> 01:22:16,380
For sure?
- I've never been so sure.

1203
01:22:16,515 --> 01:22:18,347
And never so proud.

1204
01:22:26,733 --> 01:22:29,897
So, another issue: What is
now with you and Greta?

1205
01:22:30,028 --> 01:22:31,769
Oh, Mom. She's ne gossip reporter.

1206
01:22:31,905 --> 01:22:33,316
I was just their story.

1207
01:22:33,449 --> 01:22:35,862
If you're just their story,
would have published them.

1208
01:22:36,410 --> 01:22:37,742
But if she has not.

1209
01:23:36,512 --> 01:23:37,593
Hi.

1210
01:23:39,389 --> 01:23:40,550
Hi.

1211
01:23:44,353 --> 01:23:46,345
How come you're here?

1212
01:23:47,773 --> 01:23:49,514
Very strange ...

1213
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:52,392
A few days ago came the invitation.

1214
01:23:52,694 --> 01:23:55,152
With a map of "Doria Dress".

1215
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:57,522
She did not.
- Yes, she has.

1216
01:24:00,327 --> 01:24:03,536
One has to say: Looks much
better than last time.

1217
01:24:03,747 --> 01:24:05,283
Full of dirt and snow.

1218
01:24:05,415 --> 01:24:08,658
And then your ridiculous
Bride-to-the-flight history.

1219
01:24:08,794 --> 01:24:10,456
Almost Bride.

1220
01:24:10,754 --> 01:24:12,916
I was on the hunt for a story.

1221
01:24:13,048 --> 01:24:18,794
And, Miss Kane,
They apparently found.

1222
01:24:21,139 --> 01:24:22,880
What is missing is the end.

1223
01:24:23,809 --> 01:24:25,471
It strikes me as a thing.

1224
01:24:27,771 --> 01:24:28,852
