00:01:41,502 --> 00:01:44,505
- * Is that you weeping,
my love? *

4
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:49,543
* I never meant for that

5
00:01:49,577 --> 00:01:53,414
* Ten sophisticated thumbs
in love *

6
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:58,519
* Is what I've been
blessed with *

7
00:01:58,552 --> 00:02:02,323
* If salty cheeks
give you away *

8
00:02:02,356 --> 00:02:06,494
* You don't have to say

00:02:06,527 --> 00:02:10,598
* You can wrestle a dove,
I know, my love *

10
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:14,635

I lost another student today.

13
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,479
We're making an album.

14
00:04:05,513 --> 00:04:07,648
Full length, 12 songs.

15
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:09,550
- When?

16
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,486
- Soon.
As soon as we can.

17
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,289
- How much
is it gonna cost us?

18
00:04:15,323 --> 00:04:16,757
- We're splitting it.

19
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,760
Five ways--it means
we're looking at, like...

20
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:22,763
two grand each.

21
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,303
- What are we gonna do?

22
00:04:29,337 --> 00:04:32,840
- I don't know.

23
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:35,676
I can ask my Dad for it.

24
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:37,778
- You can't ask your Dad
for it, Simon.

25
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:41,782
He wouldn't
give it to us anyway.

26
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:43,484
- Any other ideas?

27
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:44,785
We can't ask
your parents for it.

28
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:48,656
They're stretched
to their limit with Jonas.

29
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:50,791
- What's all included in it?

30
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:52,393
- Whole thing.

31
00:04:52,426 --> 00:04:54,728
Recording, mixing, mastering.

32
00:04:54,762 --> 00:04:57,731
All of it.

33
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,569
We're gonna sell it online.

34
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:03,837
Only need to sell 800
and we'll get our money back.

35
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,706
- 800?

36
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:08,609
That's a lot of downloads,
honey.

37
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:11,612
- I know.

38
00:05:19,587 --> 00:05:21,755
You know I'm doing this
for us.

39
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:23,724
For our family.

40
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:26,694
- I know.

41
00:05:26,727 --> 00:05:29,663
- What am I gonna do?

42
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:37,738
- Check.

43
00:05:53,521 --> 00:05:56,624
- Are you gonna bet or what?

44
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,465
- This has got
almost ten on it.

45
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:05,599
I'm gonna
put it in for five.

46
00:06:05,633 --> 00:06:08,402
- No, no.
Cash only in the pot.

47
00:06:08,436 --> 00:06:10,571
- This is cash, motherfucker.

48
00:06:10,604 --> 00:06:14,508
It's got cash on it.

49
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:15,609
Call.

50
00:06:15,643 --> 00:06:18,746
- You don't wanna
use those things.

51
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:22,816
They use those cards
to track you.

52
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,419
- Ain't nobody tracking me, man.

53
00:06:25,453 --> 00:06:28,722
They are if you don't
switch cards every time.

54
00:06:28,756 --> 00:06:30,924
The metro's full
of camera's, man.

55
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,926
And every time
you swipe that card,

56
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,628
your picture
gets matched up with--

57
00:06:34,662 --> 00:06:37,765
- Shut the fuck up
with your bullshit, Jonas.

58
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:39,967
Next card coming.

59
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,669
Eight of Diamonds.

60
00:06:41,702 --> 00:06:43,704
Pay is eight on the board.
- It's not bullshit.

61
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:46,574
I'm telling you
what's really going on here.

62
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:50,444
- Man, what the fuck we told you
about coming around here?

63
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:52,212
- Fucking come stand your ass
here every day

64
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:55,215
with this bullshit.

65
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,618
- I'm just saying...

66
00:06:57,651 --> 00:07:00,721
you don't wanna be tracked,
don't use those things.

67
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:03,056
- Are you deaf too?

68
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:06,460
Get back to your shit
before you get hurt.

69
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:26,947
- Fucking sheep.

70
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,649
- Who's the fucking sheep?

71
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:29,850
- Hey.

72
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:32,085
What's up, Simon?

73
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:34,087
Didn't see you there.

74
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:36,089
- Not much.

75
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:37,791
Going to work
over on Fourth Street.

76
00:07:37,825 --> 00:07:40,027
What's new with you?

77
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,029
- Same old shit.

78
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:43,831
Fucking assholes
don't wanna listen

79
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:48,569
when someone's trying
to help them.

80
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:51,104
- What else are you up to?

81
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:53,974
- I think I'm gonna
stick around here

82
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:57,477
a little bit more and, uh...

83
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:01,649
maybe work on
some writing later.

84
00:08:01,682 --> 00:08:02,850
- Writing?

85
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:07,755
What have you been writing?

86
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:08,856
- Oh, you know...

87
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:10,858
just something
I've been working on.

88
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:14,027
- That's cool.

89
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:18,866
All right, man.

90
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:20,868
I'm gonna head to work.
I'll catch you later, huh?

91
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:23,837
- Uh, yeah, take it easy.

95
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:34,808
- Do you know
what overtones are?

96
00:09:34,842 --> 00:09:36,176
- No.

97
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:39,179
- When you strike a key,
it's not just one frequency

98
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:41,381
that makes up the note
you hear.

99
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,883
Listen.

101
00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:47,821
You hear the E, right?

102
00:09:47,855 --> 00:09:49,690
That's called
the fundamental note.

103
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:52,860
Now do you also hear
the higher pitched sounds?

104
00:09:52,893 --> 00:09:55,128
Close your eyes and listen.

[hits single note]

106
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:04,004
They're above the note,
but still a part of the note.

[hits single note]

108
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,809
Can you hear that?

109
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:09,910
- Yeah.

110
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:14,715
I--I think so.

111
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:15,716
- No, you don't.

112
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:19,887
But if you keep listening,
you will someday.

113
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,921
He's doing great.

114
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,791
- That's wonderful, Simon.

115
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:25,993
- I want you to have this down
by next week, cool?

116
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:27,194
- Cool.

117
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:28,829
- And remember
it's not the quantity

118
00:10:28,862 --> 00:10:30,063
of the practice time.

119
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:31,899
- I know, quality.

120
00:10:31,932 --> 00:10:33,033
- And?

121
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:35,002
- Consistency.

122
00:10:35,035 --> 00:10:37,705
- Good job.

123
00:10:37,738 --> 00:10:39,940
- Simon, uh,
we've been very happy

124
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:43,043
with the lessons and Eric
really enjoys working with you.

125
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:44,778
- He's a great student,
I really enjoy--

126
00:10:44,812 --> 00:10:47,447
- But, uh, due
to our financial situation

127
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,451
we're gonna
have to discontinue the lessons.

128
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,721
- Oh.

129
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:54,788
I'm sorry.

130
00:10:54,822 --> 00:10:56,890
- Your payment for this week
will be sent to you,

131
00:10:56,924 --> 00:10:59,259
as usual.

132
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:00,828
Best of luck with everything.

133
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:03,797
- Thank you.

134
00:11:59,853 --> 00:12:04,357
- What the fuck is this?

135
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:07,194
Really?

136
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:08,996
- I had no part
in this, man.

137
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:12,800
- Simon, that is the opposite
of what we're trying to do here.

138
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,902
The point isn't to divide,
it's that we all have to

139
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:16,069
be on the same page.

140
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:18,071
- Honey, now
let's just calm down

141
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:19,973
and talk this through.

142
00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:21,208
- Guys, come on over.

143
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,810
No one's trying
to divide anything.

144
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:24,244
- Damn it, Mom,
I'm just saying

145
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:25,979
we need to try
to show some unity

146
00:12:26,013 --> 00:12:27,815
and solidarity for once.

147
00:12:27,848 --> 00:12:29,549
- Now you know better
than to talk to your Mother

148
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:30,183
that way, Ruth.

149
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:32,119
- Jeez, Dad, I'm not ten.

150
00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:33,954
And maybe if you
stopped treating us

151
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:36,156
like we're in middle school,
we wouldn't be so fucked up.

152
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:38,125
- How long have
you guys been here?

153
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:40,861
- I don't know,
like, 45 minutes.

154
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:42,095
- Simon, Jonas...

155
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:43,263
would you mind
just taking a seat

156
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:44,998
so we can talk about
why we're here?

157
00:12:45,032 --> 00:12:46,834
- Jonas, this is Dr. Rose.

158
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:48,568
Your Dad and I
have been meeting with him

159
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,271
for a little while now,
and he thought it might be good

160
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:53,273
if we all
got together and talked.

161
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:55,108
- I'm not
the crazy one here, Mom.

162
00:12:55,142 --> 00:12:56,276
- Not the crazy one?

163
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:58,111
You're not the crazy one?

164
00:12:58,145 --> 00:12:59,279
Look at yourself.

165
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:01,581
Look at all this crap
on your walls.

166
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,817
A normal person
doesn't spend his life

167
00:13:03,851 --> 00:13:06,987
chasing down
paranoid delusions, Jonas.

168
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,890
A normal person
doesn't go to a park every day

169
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:11,091
like he's homeless,

170
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,126
trying to talk
to whoever or whatever

171
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,895
will listen to him.

172
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:16,964
Something's gotta change
or you're gonna find yourself

173
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:18,198
in some real trouble.

174
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:20,267
Not the crazy one...

175
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,203
- All right, I'm out of here.

176
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:24,872
- Jonas, wait.

177
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:27,440
Your father is just reacting
out of frustration.

178
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,142
How would you feel
about meeting with me

179
00:13:29,176 --> 00:13:32,245
in my office tomorrow?

180
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:47,995
- I know you think
that was a bad idea.

181
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:51,999
- I do.

- I was just trying to help.

183
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,940
- I know.

184
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:04,377
But what he needs
is for you to be on his side.

185
00:14:04,411 --> 00:14:08,148
For someone
to be on his side.

186
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:12,219

by him, Simon.

anything right now?

You're probably dehydrated.

205
00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:38,198

- What?
What am I missing?

219
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:38,278
- Nothing, Simon just has
something wrong with his ears.

220
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:39,446
- Like what?

221
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:42,715

something right now?

A sound?

223
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:47,387

With this--
- Honey.

225
00:19:48,588 --> 00:19:49,756
- Wait, hold on.

226
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:51,324
Tell me about this sound.

227
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:52,692
You're hearing
something right now?

228
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:53,760

- Nothing, honey.

Years and years and years
of loud playing

231
00:19:59,466 --> 00:20:00,667
have finally done this.

232
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,602
Just go to a doctor,
get it checked out.

233
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:03,770
- No, no, no,
tell me about this.

234
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:07,707
What does it sound like?

235
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,576

right now, actually.

00:20:18,485 --> 00:20:22,655
It has, like, a low-pitch
and a high-pitch.

242
00:20:22,689 --> 00:20:25,625
And there's
this pattern to it.

243
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:26,693
Kind of like a wave,

244
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:30,663
like it's going
in and out of phase.

245
00:20:30,697 --> 00:20:32,599
- Holy shit.

246
00:20:32,632 --> 00:20:34,601
And you're
hearing this right now?

247
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:36,769
- Aw, come on, guys.
Just let it go.

248
00:20:36,803 --> 00:20:38,037
Stop feeding it.

249
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,472
- I'm not feeding anything.

250

Something is clearly
happening to him.

251
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:44,377
So is this, like,
a constant thing?

252
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:46,313
Like, all the time?

253
00:20:46,346 --> 00:20:47,380
- It seems that way.

254
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:48,748
Since last night anyway.

255
00:20:48,781 --> 00:20:51,884
- All right, I think it's time
we should get going.

256
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:55,655
You can't let him get you
all wound up about this, honey.

00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:56,689
- Wha--What?

258
00:20:56,723 --> 00:20:57,790

262
00:22:28,648 --> 00:22:30,950
- Hey, what's up?
What do you got?

263
00:22:30,983 --> 00:22:33,520
- Who are you?
- My name is Jonas.

264
00:22:33,553 --> 00:22:36,789
I'm trying to get the truth out
about mind control.

265
00:22:36,823 --> 00:22:39,659
- I'm also trying
to get the truth out, Jonas.

266
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:43,863
- About mind control?
- Secret experiments.

267
00:22:43,896 --> 00:22:48,935
Secret experiments testing
new government technologies.

268
00:22:48,968 --> 00:22:52,439
- What kind of technology?

269
00:22:52,472 --> 00:22:56,175
- Psychotropic acoustics.

270
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,744
- Can't say I've heard of it.

271
00:22:57,777 --> 00:23:03,616
- The CIA will pump noise
into a detainee's cell.

272
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:07,454
To cause him stress.
Deprive him of sleep.

273
00:23:07,487 --> 00:23:08,855
- Yeah, that's no secret.

274
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:12,492
- But the noise they use is.

275
00:23:12,525 --> 00:23:17,564
- It's called
psychotropic acoustics.

276
00:23:17,597 --> 00:23:22,201
They wanted the most
efficient noise.

277
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:25,972
The one that would
break a man the fastest.

278
00:23:26,005 --> 00:23:28,875
They found that different notes
and frequencies

279
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:33,913
stimulated different
emotional centers of the brain.

280
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:37,917
And that led to the experiments
that are happening now.

281
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:40,653
- How do you know about this?

282
00:23:40,687 --> 00:23:43,656
- Let's say
I have an inside source.

283
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:44,491
- Inside source.

284
00:23:44,524 --> 00:23:46,526
Just like everyone else
on this site

285
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:47,927

286
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,462

what you want to, Jonas.

I am not here
to convince you.

289

- What are the experiments?

290
00:23:59,706 --> 00:24:02,575
- They are controlling
mood and behavior in people

291
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:06,613
that don't even know
they are part of the experiment.

292
00:24:06,646 --> 00:24:09,081

taking place?

Listen, if you're legit,
we gotta get this story out.

00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:36,576
I can get the word out,
but you gotta tell me more.

303
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:38,611

for the truth, Jonas.

304
00:24:38,645 --> 00:24:39,946

305

we have to get this story out.

00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:54,761

the experiments three years ago

310
00:24:54,794 --> 00:24:57,096
when my test partner
told me about them.

311
00:24:57,129 --> 00:24:58,865
- Test partner.

312
00:24:58,898 --> 00:25:02,735
- When we were taken,
it was always two at a time.

313
00:25:02,769 --> 00:25:05,838
But my test partner
was ex-CIA.

314
00:25:05,872 --> 00:25:10,743
When we were on the ship,
we were in this portal.

315
00:25:10,777 --> 00:25:13,079
I learned a lot about
what the CIA was up to

316
00:25:13,112 --> 00:25:14,614
with their sound experiments.

317
00:25:14,647 --> 00:25:16,683

talking about, man?

318
00:25:16,716 --> 00:25:20,920
What portal?
What ship?

319
00:25:20,953 --> 00:25:23,022
- The aliens, Jonas.

320
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:24,657
I was abducted.

321
00:25:24,691 --> 00:25:27,994
When they tested us,
it was always two at a time.

322
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:29,762
It was my test partner that was
part of the sound experiments.

323
00:25:29,796 --> 00:25:31,731
- What, are you
fucking kidding me?

324

Are you fucking kidding me
with this shit?

325
00:25:34,601 --> 00:25:36,903
- Far from it, Jonas.

You have got to believe me,
these things really happened.

00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:01,400
It sounded like the microwave
or washing machine buzzing,

363
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:03,335
but really loud.

364
00:30:03,369 --> 00:30:05,905
- How long have you
been hearing it?

365
00:30:05,938 --> 00:30:09,441
- It started about a week ago,
I guess.

366
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:13,045
But it was much quieter then.

367
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:14,080
- All right.

368
00:30:14,113 --> 00:30:17,249
Just put those on.

369
00:30:21,954 --> 00:30:23,255
- Mr. York.

370
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:26,358
Come on back with me.

371
00:30:28,227 --> 00:30:31,297
- You have a very interesting
chart, Mr. York.

372
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,237
Have you experienced
any loud noises lately?

373
00:30:41,107 --> 00:30:42,975
- No, not recently.

374
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:45,177
- The reason I ask
is one of the possible causes

375
00:30:45,211 --> 00:30:48,014
is hearing damage.

376
00:30:48,047 --> 00:30:52,484
But that brings us
to your test results.

377
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:54,353
And those results
don't show me the damage

378
00:30:54,386 --> 00:30:58,991
for which I'd be looking.

379
00:30:59,025 --> 00:31:01,427
Now you have some moderate,
mid-range hearing loss.

380
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:04,263
You might experience some
difficulty understanding

381
00:31:04,296 --> 00:31:09,501
other people's voices.

382
00:31:09,535 --> 00:31:12,338
But your ability
to hear lower

383
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:15,007
and particularly
upper ranges...

384
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:17,676
is far outside the norm.

385
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,411
Now it varies
from person to person,

386
00:31:19,445 --> 00:31:21,680
but a man your age
typically hears

387
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:26,452
16,000, 17,000,
maybe 18,000 hertz.

388
00:31:28,154 --> 00:31:30,256
But during your test,
you're hearing as high as

389
00:31:30,289 --> 00:31:34,126
24,000 hertz.

390
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:38,397
Now my equipment doesn't even
test any higher than that.

391
00:31:40,566 --> 00:31:43,369
It's not unheard of,
but you are the first patient

392
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:49,141
I have ever had
with that kind of ability.

393
00:31:49,175 --> 00:31:54,080
- So is that
why it's happening?

394
00:31:54,113 --> 00:31:56,983
- Well...

395
00:31:57,016 --> 00:31:59,018
in your particular case,
I'm not able to rule out

396
00:31:59,051 --> 00:32:00,552
something external.

397
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:02,421
However, given the fact
that it recently started,

398
00:32:02,454 --> 00:32:05,024
it's much more likely
to be internal.

399
00:32:05,057 --> 00:32:07,359
Even psychological.

400
00:32:07,393 --> 00:32:09,228
It could perhaps
be something physical.

401
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:13,265
Something as simple
as a sinus infection.

402
00:32:13,299 --> 00:32:17,336
It can also very likely
be a psychosomatic symptom

403
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:21,507
brought on by anxiety
or nervous tension.

404
00:32:30,082 --> 00:32:32,584
Have you been experiencing
unusual stress lately,

405
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:36,355
Mr. York?

406
00:32:36,388 --> 00:32:38,457
- No.

407
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:42,294
- No major life changes
or anything like that?

408
00:32:48,634 --> 00:32:52,604
- Are you saying
I'm crazy, Doctor?

409
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:53,605
- No.

410
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:56,575
I'm not saying that,
Mr. York.

411
00:32:56,608 --> 00:33:00,346
What I am saying
is that I've seen a lot of cases

412
00:33:00,379 --> 00:33:03,482
of stress-related,
auditory hallucinations

413
00:33:03,515 --> 00:33:07,019
in people that are otherwise
completely normal.

414
00:33:10,089 --> 00:33:12,224
All right, here's
what I'm recommending.

415
00:33:12,258 --> 00:33:14,493
Get plenty of sleep,
cut back on the caffeine

416
00:33:14,526 --> 00:33:15,527
and the alcohol.

417
00:33:15,561 --> 00:33:18,530
If the problem is physical,
that should help.

418
00:33:18,564 --> 00:33:21,533
And try to limit the amount
of stress you're under.

419
00:33:21,567 --> 00:33:24,570
That'll help
if it's psychological.

420
00:33:27,173 --> 00:33:28,307
Come back and see me
in a few weeks

421
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,475
if it doesn't pass.

422
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:31,243
If that happens,
we'll take a look

423
00:33:31,277 --> 00:33:33,612
at some other treatments,
okay?

424
00:33:33,645 --> 00:33:37,383
- Okay.

425
00:33:37,416 --> 00:33:41,253
They'll take care
of you out front.

426
00:33:46,325 --> 00:33:51,263
- You did say it's possible
that it's something external.

427
00:33:51,297 --> 00:33:54,133
If it is, then what?

428
00:33:54,166 --> 00:33:57,369
- Well, I guess you just
find out where it's coming from.

429
00:34:03,642 --> 00:34:06,612

- What the fuck?
Is that a camera?

434
00:34:51,157 --> 00:34:53,892
What the fuck,
you're fucking photographing me?

Fucking cowards.

00:35:13,645 --> 00:35:17,583
- All set, Simon?

438
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:19,618
Simon?

439
00:35:19,651 --> 00:35:22,654
- Yeah, I'm good.

440
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:45,544
Can I help you?

441
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:47,579
- I'm doing just fine, Simon.

442
00:35:47,613 --> 00:35:50,516
Can I help you?

443
00:35:50,549 --> 00:35:53,285
- You heard my name inside.

444
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:56,422
- I suppose I did.

445
00:36:19,278 --> 00:36:22,381
[distant car alarm wailing]

446
00:36:36,362 --> 00:36:37,629
- Hey, it's Simon.

447
00:36:37,663 --> 00:36:40,699
What are you up to?

448
00:36:45,804 --> 00:36:48,807
- Why'd you listen to Ruth?

449
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,442
Fuck doctors, man.

450
00:36:50,476 --> 00:36:52,711
That's her answer
to everything.

451
00:36:52,744 --> 00:36:55,347
They're either in on it,
or they're just interested

452
00:36:55,381 --> 00:36:56,748
in your wallet.

453
00:36:56,782 --> 00:36:58,350
You hear me?

454
00:36:58,384 --> 00:37:00,852
- In on what, man?

455
00:37:00,886 --> 00:37:02,454
[bell rings]

456
00:37:02,488 --> 00:37:05,324

Step back, doors closing.

[doors close]

458
00:37:09,761 --> 00:37:12,030
It's back.

459
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,599
- Is that it?

460
00:37:13,632 --> 00:37:16,668
You're hearing it?
You're hearing it right now?

461
00:37:16,702 --> 00:37:22,441
- All right,
describe it to me.

462
00:37:22,474 --> 00:37:25,577
- Well, the note--it's a B.

463
00:37:25,611 --> 00:37:28,547
It sounds like
there's low humming at first.

464
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,616
But the longer it goes on,

465
00:37:30,649 --> 00:37:34,620
I hear these really high,
piercing overtones.

466
00:37:34,653 --> 00:37:38,457
It goes in and out
of phase...

467
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:40,659
There's no break in it,
it's a constant sound.

468
00:37:40,692 --> 00:37:42,594
- That's right.

469
00:37:42,628 --> 00:37:47,699
A polyphonic sound
made up of a subsonic bass note

470
00:37:47,733 --> 00:37:51,803
octaved with
its supersonic counterpart.

471
00:37:51,837 --> 00:37:56,342
It's the blend that causes
the human reaction.

472
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:59,077
It's a B.

473
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:02,414
What does a B note do?

474
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:09,388
- What the fuck
do you know about this, man?

475
00:38:09,421 --> 00:38:12,424
- I know you're not crazy.

476
00:38:12,458 --> 00:38:13,625
- How's that?

477
00:38:13,659 --> 00:38:16,528
- Because I know of these
experiments that are going on.

478
00:38:16,562 --> 00:38:20,932
I know what it
is you're hearing.

483
00:40:03,769 --> 00:40:05,637
- Are you hungry?

484
00:40:05,671 --> 00:40:06,772
- Yeah.

485
00:40:06,805 --> 00:40:10,642
- Did you go to the doctor?

486
00:40:10,676 --> 00:40:11,843
- Yeah.

487
00:40:11,877 --> 00:40:13,845
- And?

488
00:40:13,879 --> 00:40:17,516
- Have you noticed
any unusual cars tonight?

489
00:40:17,549 --> 00:40:19,651
Like any kind of odd cars
or trucks outside?

490
00:40:19,685 --> 00:40:20,619
- Why?

491
00:40:20,652 --> 00:40:23,054
- Because we should
always check for that.

492
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:25,023
Just to be careful.

493
00:40:25,056 --> 00:40:26,925
- Why are you
bringing this up now?

494
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:28,527
- And be careful
who you talk to.

495
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,761
Be careful with strangers.

496
00:40:29,795 --> 00:40:31,029
Be careful about
giving out our information.

497
00:40:31,062 --> 00:40:32,664
- Whoa, whoa, slow down.

498
00:40:32,698 --> 00:40:33,899
Why are you
bringing this up now?

499
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:34,933
What happened?

500
00:40:34,966 --> 00:40:35,934
- Nothing.

501
00:40:35,967 --> 00:40:38,069
Some weird run-ins.

502
00:40:38,103 --> 00:40:41,540
- Run-ins?
What kind of run-ins?

503
00:40:41,573 --> 00:40:43,909
- I'm talking about some
precautions for our safety.

504
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:45,744
It can't hurt, right?

505
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:48,514
- Well, I'm not so sure
about that, actually.

506
00:40:48,547 --> 00:40:49,915
- This isn't a joke, Ruth.

507
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:53,619
- Well, of course I'm always
careful, you know that.

508
00:40:53,652 --> 00:40:55,754
But you're
sounding paranoid, Simon.

509
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:56,888
- I'm just saying.

510
00:40:56,922 --> 00:40:59,791
Can you do those things for me?
For my peace of mind.

511
00:40:59,825 --> 00:41:01,793
- All right, I will.

512
00:41:01,827 --> 00:41:03,829
Do you want to talk to me
about these run-ins?

513
00:41:03,862 --> 00:41:05,564
What's been going on?

514
00:41:05,597 --> 00:41:07,899
- It's probably nothing.

515
00:41:07,933 --> 00:41:09,868
I just worry about you...

516
00:41:09,901 --> 00:41:11,102
about you both.

517
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:14,673
I just want
to make sure you're...

518
00:41:14,706 --> 00:41:16,107
Plus the sound--
it's getting worse.

519
00:41:16,141 --> 00:41:17,609
I don't know.

520
00:41:17,643 --> 00:41:18,777
I don't want to drag you
into something.

521
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:21,046
I don't know.

522
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:24,550
- You should sleep.

523
00:41:24,583 --> 00:41:26,284
- I just saw your brother.

524
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:30,989
- Yeah?
What was he doing?

525
00:41:31,022 --> 00:41:32,991
- Nothing.

526
00:41:33,024 --> 00:41:34,726
- Come on, let's go to bed.

527
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:38,029
- You go ahead,
I'll see you in a minute.

528
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:03,581
- Simon?

529
00:43:06,818 --> 00:43:09,721
- Oh, hey.

530
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:21,132
- What are you doing?

531
00:43:21,166 --> 00:43:24,402
- Oh, this?
I'm just working on something.

532
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,805
- Why did you
take our microwave apart?

533
00:43:26,838 --> 00:43:30,842
- Yeah, sorry about that.
I'll put it back together.

534
00:43:30,876 --> 00:43:33,812
- But...why?

535
00:43:35,847 --> 00:43:39,818
- When I was with Jonas,
he told me some things.

536
00:43:39,851 --> 00:43:41,787
Some things,
some very specific things

537
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:42,821
about the sound.

538
00:43:42,854 --> 00:43:43,889
About these experiments.

539
00:43:43,922 --> 00:43:45,657
- Experiments?

540
00:43:45,691 --> 00:43:49,260
- Then there's the fact
that it's just getting worse.

541
00:43:49,294 --> 00:43:52,731
- Simon, I think
you should go see Dr. Rose.

542
00:43:52,764 --> 00:43:54,733
I'm serious, baby,
I think we should just--

543
00:43:54,766 --> 00:43:57,769
- Why are doctors
your answer for everything?

544
00:43:57,803 --> 00:43:59,705
Hang out with your brother,
and now I'm crazy too?

545
00:43:59,738 --> 00:44:01,206
- No, that's not what I meant.

546
00:44:01,239 --> 00:44:04,943
I'm not saying that, honey,
I'm just saying you're stressed.

547
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:08,446
It's stress that's causing you
to hear this in your head.

548
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:09,915
- Don't you understand

549
00:44:09,948 --> 00:44:11,216
it's not in my head?

550
00:44:11,249 --> 00:44:13,752
It's coming from
somewhere out there.

551
00:44:13,785 --> 00:44:17,723
- How do you know that, Simon?
How do you know?

552
00:44:17,756 --> 00:44:19,157
Or do you
not want to go

553
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:21,292
because you're afraid
of what you might find?

554
00:44:21,326 --> 00:44:25,230
- There's nothing
to find but the sound, Ruth.

555
00:44:25,263 --> 00:44:29,234
I'm gonna find the sound,
is what I'm gonna find.

556
00:44:29,267 --> 00:44:34,105
- Baby you're really
starting to scare me now.

557
00:44:34,139 --> 00:44:36,041
You need to stop this.
You need to--

558
00:44:36,074 --> 00:44:37,909
- I can't stop this!

559
00:44:37,943 --> 00:44:41,747
I'm not making this shit up!

560
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:43,849
- I know.

561
00:44:43,882 --> 00:44:44,916
I know, baby.

562
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:47,719
I know you're
not making this up.

563
00:44:47,753 --> 00:44:49,921
I just think that something
is going on here

564
00:44:49,955 --> 00:44:51,322
that we can't
deal with ourselves

565
00:44:51,356 --> 00:44:54,726
and we need
some outside help.

566
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:57,195
I know things have
been hard with work,

567
00:44:57,228 --> 00:45:00,265
with the baby.

568
00:45:00,298 --> 00:45:04,102
I'm just saying
you're stressed.

569
00:45:04,135 --> 00:45:07,238
And I don't like
seeing you stressed.

570
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:12,944
Can you stop this?

571
00:45:12,978 --> 00:45:16,214
Let's go have some breakfast
and talk.

572
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:21,219
- I'm fine.

573
00:45:21,252 --> 00:45:22,854
It's okay.

574
00:45:22,888 --> 00:45:24,856
Go to work.

575
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:28,126
Everything will be fixed
when you get home.

576
00:45:35,934 --> 00:45:38,870
I'm serious, go.

577
00:46:01,927 --> 00:46:03,128
- What's up, man?

578
00:46:03,161 --> 00:46:06,231
- What's up?

579
00:46:10,235 --> 00:46:12,203
You ready?

580
00:46:12,237 --> 00:46:15,306
- Yeah, man,
I've been ready.

581
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:19,978
[shuffling cards]

582
00:46:20,011 --> 00:46:21,579
Hey, Jonas...

583
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:24,415
why don't you come join us
for a couple rounds?

584
00:46:24,449 --> 00:46:27,152
- Oh, I can't,
I'm waitin' on someone.

585
00:46:27,185 --> 00:46:28,987
He'll be here any minute.

586
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:31,890
- So sit until he gets here.
We're only playing one-two.

587
00:46:31,923 --> 00:46:37,128
- Thanks, I'm good.
Next time.

588
00:46:37,162 --> 00:46:39,030
- Come on, man,
just one game.

589
00:46:39,064 --> 00:46:43,301
- Yeah, c'mon, Jonas.

590
00:46:43,334 --> 00:46:45,603
- Okay, I'll give you
one round.

591
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:49,107
- All right.

592
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:52,243
Yeah.

593
00:47:00,051 --> 00:47:02,220
Check.

594
00:47:04,122 --> 00:47:06,324
- Check.

595
00:47:06,357 --> 00:47:08,359
- Bet.

596
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,102
- Cold.

597
00:47:17,135 --> 00:47:20,005
- I'm out.

598
00:47:24,075 --> 00:47:26,111
- Alright, gentlemen.

599
00:47:26,144 --> 00:47:27,345
- That's it?

600
00:47:27,378 --> 00:47:29,948
- That's one round.
I gotta go.

601
00:47:29,981 --> 00:47:32,117
- Just gonna steal the money
and run, huh?

602
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:33,351
- Hmm.

603
00:47:33,384 --> 00:47:35,921
All right, catch you later.

604
00:47:35,954 --> 00:47:37,455
- Later, guys.
- All right, man.

605
00:47:37,488 --> 00:47:40,926
- Give us a chance to win
our money back later, man.

606
00:47:50,001 --> 00:47:54,072
- I didn't know you ever
joined in those games.

607
00:47:54,105 --> 00:47:56,041
- Never have.

608
00:47:56,074 --> 00:47:59,177
- It looked like you won.

609
00:48:07,052 --> 00:48:12,991
The sound's louder here now.

610
00:48:13,024 --> 00:48:15,961
- Really?

611
00:48:43,421 --> 00:48:45,123
- Yeah, It's here.

612
00:48:45,156 --> 00:48:48,960
It's about the same
intensity as my neighborhood.

613
00:48:50,996 --> 00:48:53,464
- Got it.

614
00:49:12,617 --> 00:49:14,752
- It's not here at all.

615
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:17,989
- Nothing?

616
00:49:18,023 --> 00:49:20,958
- Absolutely nothing.

617
00:49:49,254 --> 00:49:50,788
- Hey, there you are.

618
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:52,257
I just tried calling you.

619
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:55,393
Come here.

620
00:49:58,296 --> 00:50:00,098
Oh, baby.

621
00:50:00,131 --> 00:50:02,500
You must be so tired.

622
00:50:02,533 --> 00:50:06,003
Why don't you
just crash early tonight?

623
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:53,351
- It's heavy at every stop
in the southeast.

624
00:50:53,384 --> 00:50:56,521
The lightest coverage
is in northwest.

625
00:50:56,554 --> 00:51:00,391
- If they're testing
some kind of new technology,

626
00:51:00,425 --> 00:51:01,659
then why are they doing it
in the worst neighborhoods

627
00:51:01,692 --> 00:51:03,861
before the best ones?

628
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:06,464
- Look at the pattern.

629
00:51:06,497 --> 00:51:11,402
Whatever program they're doing,
it's about race.

630
00:51:11,436 --> 00:51:13,304
It's about money.

631
00:51:13,338 --> 00:51:16,474
It's about crime.

632
00:51:30,288 --> 00:51:34,225
Prison walls.

633
00:51:34,259 --> 00:51:37,262
- What, man?

634
00:51:37,295 --> 00:51:42,200
- Prison walls.

635
00:51:42,233 --> 00:51:44,202
They paint prison walls
pastel colors

636
00:51:44,235 --> 00:51:46,437
because it calms the inmates.

637
00:51:46,471 --> 00:51:49,707
It keeps them subdued.

638
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:54,245
I've started seeing the same
colors in bad neighborhoods,

639
00:51:54,279 --> 00:51:58,483
on fences,
in playgrounds.

640
00:51:58,516 --> 00:52:01,252
That's subliminal
visual mind control.

641
00:52:01,286 --> 00:52:04,922
What you're hearing is
subliminal audio mind control.

642
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:08,359
It's why everyone's being
so damn nice all of a sudden.

643
00:52:10,728 --> 00:52:12,363
- I don't know.

644
00:52:12,397 --> 00:52:15,233
People are being nicer,
if people feel more relaxed,

645
00:52:15,266 --> 00:52:17,235
maybe it's not all bad.

646
00:52:17,268 --> 00:52:19,504
- It's all fake
is what it is.

647
00:52:19,537 --> 00:52:20,771
And now that I know
that it's happening,

648
00:52:20,805 --> 00:52:22,773
I can feel it affecting me.

649
00:52:22,807 --> 00:52:25,343
I can't think as clearly.

650
00:52:25,376 --> 00:52:27,445
It's putting me to sleep.

651
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:29,780
Which is exactly
what they want.

652
00:52:29,814 --> 00:52:31,349
- I hate to say it,
but lately

653
00:52:31,382 --> 00:52:33,351
it feels like Ruth
is different too.

654
00:52:33,384 --> 00:52:34,419
Something is changing her.

655
00:52:34,452 --> 00:52:35,753
- Of course it is.

656
00:52:35,786 --> 00:52:40,425
It's probably affecting
everyone except maybe you.

657
00:52:40,458 --> 00:52:43,394
They're gonna build this up
more and more

658
00:52:43,428 --> 00:52:45,363
and you are gonna
be the last person left

659
00:52:45,396 --> 00:52:48,499
who is not
in a trance.

660
00:52:58,343 --> 00:53:01,446
Nice dog.

661
00:53:09,254 --> 00:53:11,389
See that?

662
00:53:11,422 --> 00:53:14,659
I never would have said
that shit normally.

663
00:53:14,692 --> 00:53:16,294
- The other night
when I was walking home,

664
00:53:16,327 --> 00:53:18,429
I followed it.

665
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:21,566
It was the loudest here.
It's still loudest here.

666
00:55:39,604 --> 00:55:44,341
[indistinct voices speaking]

667
00:55:46,477 --> 00:55:49,547
[indistinct voices continue]

668
00:55:50,848 --> 00:55:54,719
[voices fade out]

669
00:58:04,114 --> 00:58:07,084
- This is it, man.

670
00:58:07,117 --> 00:58:10,621
This is the proof.

671
00:58:23,033 --> 00:58:27,137
That fucking guy online
was for real.

672
00:58:27,171 --> 00:58:30,608
We gotta find him.

673
00:58:41,619 --> 00:58:45,322
Do you realize
what this means, man?

674
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:47,658
It's gotta
be government sanctioned.

675
00:58:47,692 --> 00:58:50,728
How else would they get this
on street signs?

676
00:59:06,176 --> 00:59:09,046
I mean, this...

677
00:59:09,079 --> 00:59:12,683
this is some real,
end-of-the-world,

678
00:59:12,717 --> 00:59:15,720
apocalyptic type shit
here, man.

679
00:59:24,128 --> 00:59:29,600
It's fucking mind control.

680
00:59:29,634 --> 00:59:33,070
This is so fucked up.

681
00:59:33,103 --> 00:59:38,075
- No identifying markings.

682
00:59:38,108 --> 00:59:41,912
No manufacturer.

683
00:59:41,946 --> 00:59:45,850
No serial number.

684
00:59:45,883 --> 00:59:47,885
Nothing.

685
00:59:47,918 --> 00:59:50,821
- Of course.

686
00:59:50,855 --> 00:59:52,923
- We got nothing to go on.

687
00:59:52,957 --> 00:59:55,025
- That's not true.

688
00:59:55,059 --> 00:59:56,861
We got you.

689
00:59:56,894 --> 00:59:59,630
You can hear this shit.

690
00:59:59,664 --> 01:00:02,700
They weren't counting on that.

691
01:00:02,733 --> 01:00:05,069
- Who the fuck is they, Jonas?

692
01:00:05,102 --> 01:00:08,105
- Well, that's what
we're trying to figure out.

693
01:00:08,138 --> 01:00:11,976
- Yeah, no shit.
And we got nothing.

694
01:00:12,009 --> 01:00:15,145
- Listen to me, Simon.

695
01:00:15,179 --> 01:00:17,715
There's someone out there.

696
01:00:17,748 --> 01:00:20,017
And they're trying to make it
so that we lose the freedom

697
01:00:20,050 --> 01:00:22,653
to make our own choices.

698
01:00:22,687 --> 01:00:25,890
And they're doing it in secret.

699
01:00:25,923 --> 01:00:28,726
But we know about it, man.

700
01:00:28,759 --> 01:00:31,729
Because you can hear this shit,
we know about it.

701
01:00:31,762 --> 01:00:35,265
And that means we
can do something about it.

702
01:00:35,299 --> 01:00:37,668
We have to do something
about this, Simon.

703
01:00:37,702 --> 01:00:41,205
We have to tell people
that this shit is real.

704
01:00:41,238 --> 01:00:44,709
That this is something
that is really happening.

705
01:00:47,978 --> 01:00:50,014
- All right.

706
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:51,782
What are we gonna do?

707
01:00:51,816 --> 01:00:54,218
- Okay, well, they know.

708
01:00:54,251 --> 01:00:58,756
Whoever they are,
they know.

709
01:00:58,789 --> 01:01:02,026
And they know
that we know.

710
01:01:02,059 --> 01:01:03,928
- That we know what, man?

711
01:01:03,961 --> 01:01:07,197
That there's this box,
possibly city property,

712
01:01:07,231 --> 01:01:08,265
that we broke?

713
01:01:08,298 --> 01:01:12,036
- That we're on to them.

714
01:01:12,069 --> 01:01:14,905
Look, here are the facts.

715
01:01:14,939 --> 01:01:17,808
Did you not hear a sound?

716
01:01:19,209 --> 01:01:21,278
Did you not hear a sound?

717
01:01:21,311 --> 01:01:21,979
- Yeah.

718
01:01:22,012 --> 01:01:25,883
- Did that sound not disappear?

719
01:01:25,916 --> 01:01:29,920
Did that sound not disappear
when we took that device down?

720
01:01:29,954 --> 01:01:31,922
- Yeah, I think.

721
01:01:31,956 --> 01:01:33,057
- Okay.

722
01:01:33,090 --> 01:01:38,128
And what do you
think that means, Simon?

723
01:01:38,162 --> 01:01:40,798
- It means someone
is planting devices

724
01:01:40,831 --> 01:01:41,999
that make the sound.

725
01:01:42,032 --> 01:01:45,069
- Okay, and why would somebody
be planting these devices?

726
01:01:45,102 --> 01:01:47,037
- Because--
- That only you can hear.

727
01:01:47,071 --> 01:01:48,739
I might add.

728
01:01:48,773 --> 01:01:55,012
And that everyone else is
completely fucking oblivious to.

729
01:01:55,045 --> 01:01:57,081
- Because the sound
does something.

730
01:01:57,114 --> 01:01:58,816
- Exactly.

731
01:01:58,849 --> 01:02:04,922
Because the sound
does something.

732
01:02:04,955 --> 01:02:09,960
- Whenever you're ready,
guys, no rush.

733
01:02:09,994 --> 01:02:11,161
- Plus, man, look,

734
01:02:11,195 --> 01:02:15,299
with everyone's
strange behavior...

735
01:02:15,332 --> 01:02:16,967
it's mind control.

736
01:02:17,001 --> 01:02:19,970
Simon, is there any doubt?

737
01:02:20,004 --> 01:02:23,240
I mean, shit, you're the one
that's hearing this.

738
01:02:26,310 --> 01:02:29,313
They know
we're on to them.

739
01:02:31,982 --> 01:02:34,985
- What the hell are we
supposed to do about it, man?

740
01:02:35,019 --> 01:02:36,854
We don't know for sure.

741
01:02:36,887 --> 01:02:38,789
We don't know
any of it for sure.

742
01:02:38,823 --> 01:02:40,057
- Exactly.

743
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:44,795
That is exactly
why it works.

744
01:02:44,829 --> 01:02:47,097
Look, I know
what we have to do.

745
01:02:47,131 --> 01:02:50,067
We have to get you on video,
we have to get this out there.

746
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:53,237
That's what
we have to do.

747
01:02:55,039 --> 01:02:58,375
This is our job.

748
01:02:58,408 --> 01:03:00,945
It is our job
to let the world know

749
01:03:00,978 --> 01:03:03,948
that this is happening.

750
01:03:10,454 --> 01:03:11,088
- No.

751
01:03:11,121 --> 01:03:16,894
No, nothing like that, Mom.

752
01:03:16,927 --> 01:03:19,096
Yeah, I mean, they've been
spending a lot of time together

753
01:03:19,129 --> 01:03:22,132
it seems.

754
01:03:23,333 --> 01:03:26,803
His site?
He has a site?

755
01:03:29,239 --> 01:03:32,376
All right, all right.
I'm looking now.

756
01:03:35,445 --> 01:03:39,349
How did you know about that?
Did Jonas tell you?

757
01:03:39,383 --> 01:03:41,919
No,
he's just stressed and all.

758
01:03:41,952 --> 01:03:43,220
I mean...

759
01:03:43,253 --> 01:03:48,926
Conspiracy?

760
01:03:48,959 --> 01:03:51,428
Jonas X?

761
01:03:51,461 --> 01:03:54,431
- For decades, the government
has secretly researched

762
01:03:54,464 --> 01:03:58,335
mind-control techniques
on unsuspecting populations.

763
01:03:58,368 --> 01:04:01,906
One such experiment
is happening right now

764
01:04:01,939 --> 01:04:03,407
in our nation's capitol.

765
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:06,110
There are small devices
being installed

766
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:08,045
around Washington, D.C.

767
01:04:08,078 --> 01:04:12,449
They transmit a mysterious,
high-frequency pattern.

768
01:04:12,482 --> 01:04:14,351
Most people can't hear it.

769
01:04:14,384 --> 01:04:18,255
But I found one man who can,
and he's speaking out about it.

770
01:04:21,425 --> 01:04:24,494
How long have you
been hearing the hum?

771
01:04:24,528 --> 01:04:27,497
- I started hearing it
about a month ago.

772
01:04:27,531 --> 01:04:30,968
At first it was quieter,
and just in a few locations,

773
01:04:31,001 --> 01:04:32,369
but it grew every day.

774
01:04:32,402 --> 01:04:35,472
- And you've identified
the source?

775
01:04:35,505 --> 01:04:37,474
- I believe so.

776
01:04:42,379 --> 01:04:45,415
- These boxes,
ladies and gentlemen,

777
01:04:45,449 --> 01:04:48,052
they're hidden
atop street signs,

778
01:04:48,085 --> 01:04:50,921
traffic signals,
and utility poles.

779
01:04:50,955 --> 01:04:53,257
There are more of them
every day.

780
01:04:53,290 --> 01:04:55,259
And the sound
is now being transmitted

781
01:04:55,292 --> 01:04:57,394
over most of the city.

782
01:04:57,427 --> 01:04:59,263
Only the wealthiest
of neighborhoods

783
01:04:59,296 --> 01:05:04,401
are free of these devices.

784
01:05:04,434 --> 01:05:07,404
Please describe
the sound for us.

785
01:05:07,437 --> 01:05:10,540
- It sounds like
an electronic signal.

786
01:05:10,574 --> 01:05:13,277
Almost like
a higher-pitched bee hive.

787
01:05:13,310 --> 01:05:14,444
Or microwave.

788
01:05:14,478 --> 01:05:16,280
But it oscillates
in and out.

789
01:05:16,313 --> 01:05:19,149
- And you say you've noticed
changes in people's behavior

790
01:05:19,183 --> 01:05:23,120
when they're exposed
to the sound?

791
01:05:23,153 --> 01:05:26,723
- I believe so.

792
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:29,960
It's a subtle change,
but I've seen it.

793
01:05:29,994 --> 01:05:33,363
People seem more docile.

794
01:05:33,397 --> 01:05:36,033
I've seen it affect everyone.

795
01:05:36,066 --> 01:05:40,370
Even my own wife.

796
01:05:40,404 --> 01:05:43,007
- Corporations
use subliminal images

797
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:44,241
in advertising.

798
01:05:44,274 --> 01:05:50,047
Retailers pump artificial odors
into stores to trick people

799
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:51,515
into consuming more.

800
01:05:51,548 --> 01:05:54,751
Now the government has found
a new sense to attack

801
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:56,186
our psyches with.

802
01:05:56,220 --> 01:05:58,388
And no one knows about it.

803
01:05:58,422 --> 01:06:02,259
This is a mass
mind-control experiment

804
01:06:02,292 --> 01:06:05,029
being perpetrated against
the American people

805
01:06:05,062 --> 01:06:08,065
without our consent.

806
01:06:08,098 --> 01:06:11,335
How much can they control us
with this technology?

807
01:06:11,368 --> 01:06:14,104
What government agency
or corporation

808
01:06:14,138 --> 01:06:17,041
is installing these devices?

809
01:06:17,074 --> 01:06:21,578
How come the devices themselves
have no identifying marks?

810
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:25,349
Check your own city.

811
01:06:25,382 --> 01:06:28,118
Look to the stoplights
and utility poles.

812
01:06:28,152 --> 01:06:30,354
The signs are everywhere.

813
01:06:30,387 --> 01:06:35,092
It's just a matter
of looking and listening.

814
01:06:35,125 --> 01:06:36,426
Spread the word.

815
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:39,563
We must fight this
while there's still time.

816
01:06:43,133 --> 01:06:48,405
Thank you for watching
a Jonas X production.

817
01:06:50,274 --> 01:06:52,142
[echoing]
A polyphonic sound...

818
01:06:52,176 --> 01:06:56,380
made up
of a subsonic bass note...

819
01:06:56,413 --> 01:07:00,417
octaved with
its supersonic counterpart.

820
01:07:14,631 --> 01:07:18,435
It's the blend
that causes the reaction.

821
01:07:26,310 --> 01:07:29,146
- I'm home.

822
01:07:29,179 --> 01:07:32,249
Did you eat yet?

823
01:07:36,653 --> 01:07:40,290
You all right?

824
01:07:40,324 --> 01:07:43,493
Is everything okay?

825
01:07:44,461 --> 01:07:47,531
Ruth, did something happen?

826
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:55,239
- Were you ever
gonna tell me?

827
01:07:55,272 --> 01:07:57,607
- Tell you?

828
01:07:57,641 --> 01:08:02,412
- Yeah.

829
01:08:02,446 --> 01:08:03,380
Tell me.

830
01:08:03,413 --> 01:08:05,149
- [Jonas' voice echoing]
Look at the pattern.

831
01:08:05,182 --> 01:08:07,151
It's about race.

832
01:08:07,184 --> 01:08:09,119
It's about money.

833
01:08:09,153 --> 01:08:10,387
It's about crime.

834
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:13,190
- Listen, honey...

835
01:08:13,223 --> 01:08:15,125
I didn't wanna worry you.

836
01:08:15,159 --> 01:08:16,660
I don't want
to involve you.

837
01:08:16,693 --> 01:08:18,528
- Involve me?

838
01:08:18,562 --> 01:08:21,331
You didn't
want to involve me?

839
01:08:21,365 --> 01:08:22,532
I'm your wife, Simon.

840
01:08:22,566 --> 01:08:24,368
I'm pretty fucking involved.

841
01:08:24,401 --> 01:08:28,472
- You know that's
not what I meant.

842
01:08:28,505 --> 01:08:33,477
- I'm so upset right now,
I can't even feel anything.

843
01:08:33,510 --> 01:08:36,513
And I don't know what's worse,
you doing this with Jonas

844
01:08:36,546 --> 01:08:38,748
or you doing this
without telling me.

845
01:08:38,782 --> 01:08:40,384
- I did tell you.

846
01:08:40,417 --> 01:08:41,618
You brushed it off
like it was nothing,

847
01:08:41,651 --> 01:08:42,486
like I'm crazy.

848
01:08:42,519 --> 01:08:44,454
- Have you seen the video?

849
01:08:44,488 --> 01:08:48,258
I mean, "It's even
affecting my wife."

850
01:08:48,292 --> 01:08:49,426
You don't think
what you're doing is

851
01:08:49,459 --> 01:08:51,228
even the slightest bit abnormal?

852
01:08:51,261 --> 01:08:52,362
- Absolutely it is.

853
01:08:52,396 --> 01:08:55,299
Just like me hearing this
goddamn sound is abnormal.

854
01:08:55,332 --> 01:08:56,766
- Please can you
just talk to me about this

855
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:58,668
without having to drink?

856
01:08:58,702 --> 01:09:00,670
Are you completely clueless
of your behavior

857
01:09:00,704 --> 01:09:03,507
these past few weeks?

858
01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:08,645
[Jonas' voice
echoes indistinct]

859
01:09:08,678 --> 01:09:14,584
You never went to see Dr. Rose,
you never took my advice.

860
01:09:14,618 --> 01:09:18,255
Instead you started hanging out
with Jonas--Jonas!

861
01:09:18,288 --> 01:09:22,426
And, honestly, you honestly
can't put two and two together?

862
01:09:22,459 --> 01:09:24,328
What the hell did you think
was gonna come of

863
01:09:24,361 --> 01:09:25,762
turning to Jonas for answers?

864
01:09:25,795 --> 01:09:28,265
- Turning to Jonas for answers?

865
01:09:28,298 --> 01:09:29,533
How about that Jonas
is the only person

866
01:09:29,566 --> 01:09:31,235
that takes what
I'm going through seriously?

867
01:09:31,268 --> 01:09:33,337
How about that my own wife
just swept it under a rug?

868
01:09:33,370 --> 01:09:35,405
- Don't even--
don't you even.

869
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:37,607
How about that
I'm still here?

870
01:09:37,641 --> 01:09:39,976
How about that you chose
to listen to Jonas' bullshit

871
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:42,412
instead of my advice?

872
01:09:42,446 --> 01:09:44,681
- It's not bullshit.

873
01:09:44,714 --> 01:09:46,250
He's right.

874
01:09:46,283 --> 01:09:47,351
He knows what
he's talking about.

875
01:09:47,384 --> 01:09:50,987
- Simon, please.
Think a moment.

876
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:52,589
Which is more likely,

877
01:09:52,622 --> 01:09:54,558
that you're having
a personal problem

878
01:09:54,591 --> 01:09:55,759
and you need help,

879
01:09:55,792 --> 01:09:58,662
or that the grand conspiracy
that Jonas has come up with

880
01:09:58,695 --> 01:10:00,730
is real?

881
01:10:00,764 --> 01:10:02,366
- What I'm hearing is real.

882
01:10:02,399 --> 01:10:03,800
The evidence
I've seen is real, Ruth.

883
01:10:03,833 --> 01:10:05,569
- What evidence?

884
01:10:05,602 --> 01:10:08,305
Little streetlight boxes
you can supposedly hear?

885
01:10:08,338 --> 01:10:10,474
People being nice
to each other?

886
01:10:10,507 --> 01:10:12,008
Somehow you get
a government conspiracy

887
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:13,677
out of that, seriously?

888
01:10:13,710 --> 01:10:16,246
- [Jonas' voice echoing]
Keeps them subdued...

889
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:18,248
- Simon...

890
01:10:18,282 --> 01:10:20,450
- I know you're not crazy...

891
01:10:20,484 --> 01:10:24,454
- Look, I know you're trying
to understand what's going on,

892
01:10:24,488 --> 01:10:26,356
but Jonas can't
even help himself,

893
01:10:26,390 --> 01:10:30,260
let alone you.

894
01:10:30,294 --> 01:10:31,761
- Everything he's said...

895
01:10:31,795 --> 01:10:35,632
everything we've seen,
it all fits.

896
01:10:35,665 --> 01:10:38,602
- Does it?

897
01:10:38,635 --> 01:10:41,271
Simon, that's what he does.

898
01:10:41,305 --> 01:10:43,473
He puts unconnected things
together and turns them into

899
01:10:43,507 --> 01:10:45,041
something that
makes him the center

900
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:47,744
of something important.

901
01:10:47,777 --> 01:10:49,346
And that's
what he's done here.

902
01:10:49,379 --> 01:10:51,648
He's made you believe it.

903
01:10:51,681 --> 01:10:54,351
But it's never real,
it's not real this time.

904
01:10:54,384 --> 01:10:56,620
You must know that.

905
01:10:56,653 --> 01:11:00,324
- I know what it is
you're hearing...

906
01:11:00,357 --> 01:11:01,825
- You needed
to go to Dr. Rose

907
01:11:01,858 --> 01:11:03,627
when this first
started happening.

908
01:11:03,660 --> 01:11:06,496
Precisely so it wouldn't
spin out of control,

909
01:11:06,530 --> 01:11:09,833
so it wouldn't turn into
something like this.

910
01:11:09,866 --> 01:11:13,470
Why do the two of you
have to be so fucking stubborn?

911
01:11:13,503 --> 01:11:14,738
I mean, it's not impossible

912
01:11:14,771 --> 01:11:17,507
that it's something
psychological, you know?

913
01:11:17,541 --> 01:11:19,443
I mean, really just
going to a therapist

914
01:11:19,476 --> 01:11:21,911
does not mean you're crazy.

915
01:11:21,945 --> 01:11:26,383
God, and tearing down that box?
You could have been arrested.

916
01:11:26,416 --> 01:11:27,651
- I know you're not crazy...

917
01:11:27,684 --> 01:11:30,754
I know what it is
you're hearing.

918
01:11:30,787 --> 01:11:32,088
- We've...

919
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:33,657
we've lost Jonas already.

920
01:11:33,690 --> 01:11:38,695
I can't even have a normal
conversation with him.

921
01:11:38,728 --> 01:11:40,764
And I couldn't bear it
if you sunk into those

922
01:11:40,797 --> 01:11:44,100
paranoid delusions.

923
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:46,370
There is no coming back
from that.

924
01:11:46,403 --> 01:11:50,707
- I know you're not crazy...

925
01:11:50,740 --> 01:11:55,545
I know what it is
you're hearing.

926
01:11:55,579 --> 01:11:59,716
What you're hearing is
subliminal audio mind control.

927
01:11:59,749 --> 01:12:01,485
- Oh, my God.

928
01:12:01,518 --> 01:12:05,489
- What you're hearing is
subliminal audio mind control.

929
01:12:05,522 --> 01:12:08,725
You're already there.

930
01:12:13,897 --> 01:12:15,699
- Hey. Hey!

931
01:12:15,732 --> 01:12:18,134
I'm not anywhere except
right here with you,

932
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:19,636
you hear me?

933
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:22,739
I'm not anywhere except
right here with you.

934
01:12:29,979 --> 01:12:32,949
You wanted to come with me?

935
01:12:32,982 --> 01:12:35,519
- I think we should
see what he says.

936
01:12:35,552 --> 01:12:37,454
If he thinks it's a good idea
for us to go together,

937
01:12:37,487 --> 01:12:40,457
I'm happy to.

938
01:12:40,490 --> 01:12:42,559
I just want you healed.

939
01:12:42,592 --> 01:12:45,595
I want us to figure out
what's going on with your ears.

940
01:12:45,629 --> 01:12:48,765
I just want things
to be like they were before.

941
01:12:48,798 --> 01:12:51,768
- Me too, honey.

942
01:12:53,570 --> 01:12:57,874
- So are you, um,
are not hearing it anymore?

943
01:12:57,907 --> 01:13:01,377
- I am.

944
01:13:05,949 --> 01:13:08,418
You look really nice.

945
01:13:08,452 --> 01:13:10,820
- What, you like
the puffy-eyed look?

946
01:13:10,854 --> 01:13:14,624
- You look beautiful.

947
01:13:14,658 --> 01:13:18,762
- I am so sorry I didn't
take you seriously before.

948
01:13:18,795 --> 01:13:22,666
And really, it means a lot
that you're willing to do this.

949
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:28,905
I don't care if we're broke,
if we're living in a shack.

950
01:13:28,938 --> 01:13:30,907
I just want you
to do what you love,

951
01:13:30,940 --> 01:13:32,776
I want us to be happy.

952
01:13:32,809 --> 01:13:35,779
That's all I want.

953
01:13:39,483 --> 01:13:42,519
What is it?

954
01:13:42,552 --> 01:13:44,754
Hey.

955
01:13:44,788 --> 01:13:46,523
- Say something.

956
01:13:46,556 --> 01:13:50,760
- Hi, why
are we not walking?

957
01:13:50,794 --> 01:13:51,861
- It stopped.

958
01:13:51,895 --> 01:13:53,663
- What stopped?

959
01:13:53,697 --> 01:13:56,533
- The sound.

960
01:13:56,566 --> 01:13:58,935
- You're not
hearing it anymore?

961
01:13:58,968 --> 01:14:00,937
- No, it's gone.

962
01:14:00,970 --> 01:14:02,572
It just stopped.

963
01:14:02,606 --> 01:14:03,707
Suddenly.

964
01:14:03,740 --> 01:14:05,609
- Honey, are
you messing with me?

965
01:14:05,642 --> 01:14:07,977
Do not mess with me
right now.

966
01:14:08,011 --> 01:14:09,879
- No, I'm not kidding.

967
01:14:09,913 --> 01:14:11,080
It's really gone.

968
01:14:11,114 --> 01:14:12,849
It's faded out before,

969
01:14:12,882 --> 01:14:16,920
but it's never just stopped
abruptly, mid-sound like that.

970
01:14:16,953 --> 01:14:18,955
- Honey, this is great.

971
01:14:18,988 --> 01:14:20,824
Whatever you're thinking,
whatever you're feeling,

972
01:14:20,857 --> 01:14:22,759
just focus on that.

973
01:14:22,792 --> 01:14:25,094
This is a good thing.

974
01:14:25,128 --> 01:14:30,534
I am so sorry
we didn't do this before.

975
01:14:30,567 --> 01:14:33,903
- I can't believe it.

976
01:14:33,937 --> 01:14:37,040
- Come on, let's go home.

977
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,802
[suspenseful music]

978
01:15:05,835 --> 01:15:08,805
Simon?

979
01:15:10,740 --> 01:15:13,710
Simon?

980
01:15:20,016 --> 01:15:23,753
Oh, my God.

981
01:15:23,787 --> 01:15:26,022
It's back.

982
01:15:26,055 --> 01:15:29,525
It's back, isn't it?

983
01:15:30,794 --> 01:15:34,030
God, I knew it.

984
01:15:34,063 --> 01:15:38,334
I knew it.

985
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:41,905
- It's different.

986
01:15:41,938 --> 01:15:46,109
It's different now.

987
01:15:46,142 --> 01:15:49,613
It's changed.

988
01:15:59,989 --> 01:16:02,792
Yeah.
Hey, listen.

989
01:16:02,826 --> 01:16:06,362
The note, it changed.

990
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:10,800
Somebody turned it off earlier,
and there was nothing.

991
01:16:10,834 --> 01:16:12,802
Now it's back.

992
01:16:12,836 --> 01:16:14,070
It's louder now.

993
01:16:14,103 --> 01:16:17,073
And the noise changed.

994
01:16:17,106 --> 01:16:20,109
It's an F-sharp now.

995
01:16:20,143 --> 01:16:25,782
- F-sharp?

996
01:16:25,815 --> 01:16:26,816
Uh...ah...

997
01:16:26,850 --> 01:16:27,684
all right, man, look.

998
01:16:27,717 --> 01:16:30,219
I have to think about
what this means.

999
01:16:30,253 --> 01:16:31,921
I'm gonna go out and walk around
for a little while,

1000
01:16:31,955 --> 01:16:33,823
and I'll let you know
if I see anything weird

1001
01:16:33,857 --> 01:16:35,725
going on.

1002
01:16:54,210 --> 01:16:55,845
- What'd I tell you?

1003
01:16:55,879 --> 01:16:59,148
What'd I tell you
about coming around here?

1004
01:17:08,925 --> 01:17:10,093
- Yeah, we straight on that.

1005
01:17:10,126 --> 01:17:11,260
- The fuck we are.

1006
01:17:11,294 --> 01:17:12,829
You into me for $50.

1007
01:17:12,862 --> 01:17:14,798
- Yeah, and I got you back
last night.

1008
01:17:14,831 --> 01:17:16,933
You're so high
you don't even remember.

1009
01:17:16,966 --> 01:17:18,267
- The fuck I am!

1010
01:17:18,301 --> 01:17:20,103
If you got me back,
then what'd I do with it?

1011
01:17:20,136 --> 01:17:22,005
- How the hell do I know?

1012
01:17:22,038 --> 01:17:24,040
- What the fuck
you doin' here?

1013
01:17:24,073 --> 01:17:25,842
- Nothing, just walking.

1014
01:17:25,875 --> 01:17:29,278
- Little past your bedtime,
isn't it, Jonas?

1015
01:17:29,312 --> 01:17:30,213
Hey!

1016
01:17:30,246 --> 01:17:31,781
What, you got a camera?

1017
01:17:31,815 --> 01:17:34,183
What are you
fucking gonna do with that?

1018
01:18:08,351 --> 01:18:10,854
- This is Jonas X,
and I'm documenting

1019
01:18:10,887 --> 01:18:14,190
the events of the night
of March 15th.

1020
01:18:19,228 --> 01:18:22,165
I'm at the 18th street park.

1021
01:18:22,198 --> 01:18:24,934
So far things seem...

1022
01:18:24,968 --> 01:18:27,804
- What the fuck?
- What the fuck?

1023
01:18:27,837 --> 01:18:30,006
[loud punch]

1024
01:18:30,039 --> 01:18:31,140
- Filming me and shit.

1025
01:18:31,174 --> 01:18:34,277
Always knew you
were a fucking rat.

1026
01:18:39,115 --> 01:18:40,750
- Unh...

1027
01:18:40,784 --> 01:18:42,952
- * So you feel
you're touched *

1028
01:18:42,986 --> 01:18:46,222
* Beneath your guise

1029
01:18:46,255 --> 01:18:53,229
* So you won't forget me
when I die *

1030
01:18:53,262 --> 01:18:56,232
* And so you feel
you're touched *

1031
01:18:56,265 --> 01:19:00,837
* Beneath your guise

1032
01:19:00,870 --> 01:19:06,375
* And so you won't forget me
when I die *

1033
01:19:06,409 --> 01:19:08,111
- [laughs]

1034
01:19:08,144 --> 01:19:09,779
Man, that fool is crazy.

1035
01:19:09,813 --> 01:19:11,948
[laughter]

1036
01:19:11,981 --> 01:19:13,016
- That's mine!

1037
01:19:13,049 --> 01:19:15,118
I need it back.

1038
01:19:15,151 --> 01:19:17,253
- [laughs]
Look at him!

1039
01:19:17,286 --> 01:19:19,989
- I said that's mine!

1040
01:19:20,023 --> 01:19:21,858
- So you didn't
get enough already, bitch?

1041
01:19:21,891 --> 01:19:23,359
- Look, you don't know
what's happening right now.

1042
01:19:23,392 --> 01:19:25,929
Something is messing
with your heads.

1043
01:19:25,962 --> 01:19:26,930
- What?

1044
01:19:26,963 --> 01:19:28,264
[loud punch]
- Oh!

1045
01:19:28,297 --> 01:19:35,371
- * So you won't forget me
when I die *

1046
01:19:39,976 --> 01:19:43,179
- Ain't nobody
messing with our heads, fool.

1047
01:20:10,106 --> 01:20:14,310
- * Say it isn't so

1048
01:20:14,343 --> 01:20:18,047
* Don't you remember

1049
01:20:18,081 --> 01:20:20,149
* How it feels

1050
01:20:20,183 --> 01:20:24,387
* To be alive

1051
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:28,191
* Don't you remember

1052
01:20:28,224 --> 01:20:31,961
* How it feels to be--

1053
01:20:35,664 --> 01:20:38,634
- You two have gotten
to spend a lot of time together.

1054
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:42,105
How long has it been
since the incident?

1055
01:20:42,138 --> 01:20:44,373
- A few weeks.

1056
01:20:44,407 --> 01:20:48,177
- And how are you feeling
about everything?

1057
01:20:48,211 --> 01:20:50,880
- I think I'm handling it
all right.

1058
01:20:50,914 --> 01:20:52,348
Things seem
to be going pretty well.

1059
01:20:52,381 --> 01:20:55,118
- How are things with Ruth?

1060
01:20:55,151 --> 01:20:56,652
- They're really good.

1061
01:20:56,685 --> 01:21:00,256
Better than they've been
in a long time.

1062
01:21:06,262 --> 01:21:11,100
That was good last night.

1063
01:21:11,134 --> 01:21:12,135
- What?

1064
01:21:12,168 --> 01:21:15,404
The movie?

1065
01:21:15,438 --> 01:21:18,874
- Oh, yeah,
the movie was good too.

1066
01:21:21,010 --> 01:21:22,979
- Oh, I see.

1067
01:21:23,012 --> 01:21:26,015
- What?

1068
01:21:26,049 --> 01:21:30,386
- You should have said,
"That was nice last night."

1069
01:21:30,419 --> 01:21:33,889
Since a movie
can't really be nice.

1070
01:21:37,226 --> 01:21:40,229
And, yes,
last night was very...

1071
01:21:40,263 --> 01:21:43,332
- Good?
- [giggles]

1072
01:21:46,302 --> 01:21:48,704
- Door-to-door service.

1073
01:21:48,737 --> 01:21:51,274
- Thank you, baby.

1074
01:21:51,307 --> 01:21:54,010
So I'll see you tonight?

1075
01:21:54,043 --> 01:21:58,014
- You will.

1076
01:21:58,047 --> 01:21:59,448
What?

1077
01:21:59,482 --> 01:22:01,384
I'm fine.

1078
01:22:01,417 --> 01:22:03,152
- Okay.

1079
01:22:03,186 --> 01:22:06,289
I love you.

1080
01:22:11,127 --> 01:22:14,197
Bye.
- Bye.

1081
01:22:30,279 --> 01:22:31,580
- Simon, do you realize
what happened to you

1082
01:22:31,614 --> 01:22:34,483
during the time
you spent with Jonas?

1083
01:22:34,517 --> 01:22:37,220
When the two of you
went looking for the sound,

1084
01:22:37,253 --> 01:22:39,989
before it stopped?

1085
01:22:40,023 --> 01:22:42,758
- I do, Doctor.

1086
01:22:42,791 --> 01:22:47,263
I experienced
a, uh, shared psychosis

1087
01:22:47,296 --> 01:22:48,264
with Jonas.

1088
01:22:48,297 --> 01:22:50,066
- That's correct, Simon.

1089
01:22:50,099 --> 01:22:54,270
What you experienced is called
induced delusional disorder.

1090
01:22:54,303 --> 01:22:55,504
It's a syndrome
in which symptoms

1091
01:22:55,538 --> 01:22:57,606
of a delusional belief
are transmitted

1092
01:22:57,640 --> 01:23:00,543
from one individual
to another.

1093
01:23:00,576 --> 01:23:04,180
When you were hearing the sound,
your psychological vulnerability

1094
01:23:04,213 --> 01:23:06,582
caused you
to latch on to Jonas.

1095
01:23:06,615 --> 01:23:11,587
It caused you to take on,
believe, and effectively live

1096
01:23:11,620 --> 01:23:13,356
in his reality.

1097
01:23:13,389 --> 01:23:16,625
It's not surprising, Simon,
that the sound stopped

1098
01:23:16,659 --> 01:23:18,327
these past few weeks,

1099
01:23:18,361 --> 01:23:20,096
without Jonas.

1100
01:23:20,129 --> 01:23:22,598
Without his influence.

1101
01:23:22,631 --> 01:23:25,101
- So when are you coming back
to see me again?

1102
01:23:25,134 --> 01:23:26,369
- I'll be back on Thursday.

1103
01:23:26,402 --> 01:23:29,072
What are you
going to do until then?

1104
01:23:29,105 --> 01:23:31,074
- I'm a good student, Doc.

1105
01:23:31,107 --> 01:23:33,276
- Jonas, what are you
going to do for me

1106
01:23:33,309 --> 01:23:36,245
before next time?

1107
01:23:36,279 --> 01:23:38,181
- I'm gonna walk around
this damn room

1108
01:23:38,214 --> 01:23:39,615
for 30 minutes every day.

1109
01:23:39,648 --> 01:23:41,450
- You can walk around
outside too.

1110
01:23:41,484 --> 01:23:43,286
It doesn't matter where,
as long as you do it

1111
01:23:43,319 --> 01:23:47,123
for 30 minutes a day.

1112
01:23:47,156 --> 01:23:49,125
- Knock, knock.
- Oh, come on in.

1113
01:23:49,158 --> 01:23:50,826
We're just finishing up.

1114
01:23:50,859 --> 01:23:52,261
[sighs]

1115
01:23:52,295 --> 01:23:54,497
All right, I'll see
you Thursday, Jonas.

1116
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:56,499
- Thanks, Doc.

1117
01:24:00,469 --> 01:24:03,572
- Here, I got you something.

1118
01:24:09,578 --> 01:24:11,414
It's about these aliens
that come to Earth

1119
01:24:11,447 --> 01:24:12,681
and spawn with humans.

1120
01:24:12,715 --> 01:24:14,283
'Cause that's
the most logical way

1121
01:24:14,317 --> 01:24:15,618
of getting rid of them.

1122
01:24:15,651 --> 01:24:16,552
- [chuckles]

1123
01:24:16,585 --> 01:24:20,156
They breed them out.
- Yeah, it's crazy.

1124
01:24:20,189 --> 01:24:23,326
Give it a read.

1125
01:24:27,730 --> 01:24:29,398
What is it?

1126
01:24:29,432 --> 01:24:31,700
- Is it still gone?

1127
01:24:31,734 --> 01:24:33,436
- Yeah, man.

1128
01:24:33,469 --> 01:24:37,873
- I think whatever it was,
it's done.

1129
01:24:37,906 --> 01:24:40,276
- Whatever it was...

1130
01:24:40,309 --> 01:24:44,113
you and me both know
exactly what it was.

1131
01:24:44,147 --> 01:24:45,648
- Yeah, I know.

1132
01:24:45,681 --> 01:24:49,252
- We just scared some shit
into them, man.

1133
01:24:52,221 --> 01:24:54,590
We fucking did it.

1134
01:24:54,623 --> 01:24:58,594
I can't believe
we fucking did it.

1135
01:24:58,627 --> 01:25:01,130
- We did.

1136
01:25:01,164 --> 01:25:04,233
- Hell yes we did, man.

1137
01:25:04,267 --> 01:25:07,336
I mean, I bet those fuckers
knew you could hear that shit.

1138
01:25:07,370 --> 01:25:10,473
We would have exposed their shit
to the world.

1139
01:25:10,506 --> 01:25:12,341
When you heard
that note change,

1140
01:25:12,375 --> 01:25:14,577
it was some kind of beta test
or something.

1141
01:25:14,610 --> 01:25:17,613
I mean, I was feeling
angry as fuck that night.

1142
01:25:17,646 --> 01:25:21,150
For no reason.

1143
01:25:21,184 --> 01:25:23,219
Damn near got me killed too.

1144
01:25:23,252 --> 01:25:26,422
- Thank God it didn't, man.

1145
01:25:26,455 --> 01:25:29,225
- Yeah, no doubt.

1146
01:25:29,258 --> 01:25:32,361
So tell me again, man.

1147
01:25:32,395 --> 01:25:34,930
- Not much to tell.

1148
01:25:34,963 --> 01:25:37,766
Heard it change,
freaked out,

1149
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:42,338
woke up the next morning--
ears clear as a bell.

1150
01:25:42,371 --> 01:25:45,474
Just silence.

1151
01:25:47,410 --> 01:25:49,278
- Well, at least
we're aware now.

1152
01:25:49,312 --> 01:25:50,679
I get back home,
we'll spread the word

1153
01:25:50,713 --> 01:25:52,381
about what we did.

1154
01:25:52,415 --> 01:25:56,952
Try and open people's eyes
to what's going on.

1155
01:25:56,985 --> 01:25:59,655
- Why don't you just focus on
getting yourself better for now,

1156
01:25:59,688 --> 01:26:01,957
huh, Jonas?

1157
01:26:01,990 --> 01:26:04,260
- Fair enough.

1158
01:26:06,695 --> 01:26:10,266
For now.

1159
01:26:10,299 --> 01:26:11,400

01:26:20,809 --> 01:26:26,715
* You just show it

1163

* You just show it

* You just show it

* Very instrumentally

1169
01:26:59,348 --> 01:27:08,657
* The least fashionable way

1170
01:27:08,691 --> 01:27:13,696
* So you feel

1171
01:27:13,729 --> 01:27:20,469
* Just like
you can break yourself *

1172
01:27:20,503 --> 01:27:26,342
* And remake yourself

1173
01:27:26,375 --> 01:27:33,682
