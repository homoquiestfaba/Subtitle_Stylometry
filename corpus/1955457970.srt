1
00:00:01,936 --> 00:00:04,003
        (ominous music)         

2
00:00:19,887 --> 00:00:22,221
     - So it is with heavy      
     hearts, we lay to rest     

3
00:00:22,223 --> 00:00:24,223
    your daughter Elizabeth.    

4
00:00:24,225 --> 00:00:26,558
   But let us rejoice in the    
    knowledge that you have     

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,062
     welcomed her into your     
 kingdom of everlasting light.  

6
00:00:30,064 --> 00:00:32,798
    She is in the company of    
     Jesus Christ, who died     

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,733
         and now lives.         

8
00:00:34,735 --> 00:00:37,736
    May she rejoice in your     
    kingdom, where all tears    

9
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:42,041
are wiped away, united together 
   with her father in heaven.   

10
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:45,444
    Now, and forever, amen.     

11
00:00:46,514 --> 00:00:49,581
      (sad ominous music)       

12
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:35,594
       (glass shattering)       

13
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:36,462
            - Adam?             

14
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:45,637
         Are you okay?          

15
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:50,209
         - Turn it off.         

16
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:52,811
        - Adam I think--        

17
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:54,813
     - Turn it off I said.      

18
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:18,804
             Sarah?             

19
00:02:21,609 --> 00:02:22,708
            - Yeah?             

20
00:02:24,345 --> 00:02:26,178
     - It's all your fault.     

21
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,981
             - Oh!              
          (gun fires)           

22
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:47,099
       (foreboding music)       

23
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,366
    - Hasn't changed a bit.     

24
00:03:23,204 --> 00:03:25,571
  - Not since Mom died in it.   

25
00:03:58,339 --> 00:03:59,938
       - Home sweet home.       

26
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:12,417
   Well, power's on at least.   

27
00:04:13,621 --> 00:04:15,921
   Let's see about the water.   

28
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:24,763
             - Eww.             

29
00:04:29,036 --> 00:04:30,736
     - Yeah it's been more      
       than a few years,        

30
00:04:30,738 --> 00:04:33,805
 (mumbling) all sorts of gunk.  

31
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:35,874
 Can't wait to see the toilets. 

32
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:38,510
        (ominous music)         

33
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:05,003
       Sarah can you help       
       me out with this?        

34
00:05:12,112 --> 00:05:14,579
          (sad music)           

35
00:05:56,824 --> 00:05:57,956
        - [Sarah] What?         

36
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:00,926
    - I didn't say anything.    

37
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:17,743
       - This is Chino's?       

38
00:06:17,745 --> 00:06:18,910
            - Yeah.             

39
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:20,712
      - Ah it's terrible.       

40
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:22,748
            - Yeah.             

41
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:29,154
      - What are we doing?      

42
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:31,556
      - What do you mean?       

43
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:32,991
       - Why are we here?       

44
00:06:34,595 --> 00:06:36,995
       - I thought coming       
      home might help you.      

45
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:38,096
           - Help me?           

46
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,933
         - Make a fresh         
       start with things.       

47
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:44,970
       Away from all that       
      happened last year.       

48
00:06:46,407 --> 00:06:50,075
- Right, and this place is just 
  full of wonderful memories.   

49
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:54,613
 - Things are gonna get better. 

50
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:55,480
           - Better?            

51
00:06:56,884 --> 00:06:58,450
 Is that what we're doing here? 

52
00:06:58,452 --> 00:07:00,552
    We're just gonna go back    
      and live in the past      

53
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:03,054
        and pretend like        
    everything that happened    

54
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:04,923
    never actually happened.    

55
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,892
   - That's not what I said.    

56
00:07:06,894 --> 00:07:10,362
     - My daughter's dead,      
       my husband's dead.       

57
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:15,734
And now I'm back living at home 

58
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:19,104
      which I something I       
    swore I would never do.     

59
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:22,007
- I know it's not gonna be easy.

60
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:24,876
   What you've been through.    

61
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:25,977
            - Yeah.             

62
00:07:32,553 --> 00:07:33,985
       It's just strange.       

63
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:36,888
         - Strange how?         

64
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:40,459
     - This sudden interest     
   you're showing in my life.   

65
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:43,094
       - Sarah you're my        
      sister, I love you.       

66
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:45,163
     - Come on for 10 years     
      I was a name on your      

67
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:47,966
   Christmas card list, what    
  did you meet your niece once  

68
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,901
      when she was a baby?      

69
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:53,071
  Even after she got sick you   
  couldn't be bothered to call  

70
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:57,342
  and try to be her uncle, get  
   to know her before she...    

71
00:08:01,615 --> 00:08:02,481
             - No.              

72
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:06,084
         You're right.          

73
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:11,156
      Growing up you were       
   always there for me, you,    

74
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:14,659
  always had my back with Mom,  
    and when everything went    

75
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:18,129
      to shit I should've       
      been there for you.       

76
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:19,698
       But I'm here now.        

77
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:22,067
            - Yeah.             

78
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:24,903
         Here you are.          

79
00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:27,239
              Hmm.              

80
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:33,111
    Fuck, broke my tooth on     
  this rubbery goddamn pizza.   

81
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:36,281
        - Are you okay?         

82
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:38,049
      - I'm going to bed.       

83
00:08:55,836 --> 00:08:58,069
  - Come on, give us a signal.  

84
00:09:00,307 --> 00:09:01,540
        (door knocking)         

85
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:02,707
             Yeah?              

86
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:03,708
    - [Sarah] Can I come in?    

87
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,776
          - Of course.          

88
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:10,348
     Hey, how's the tooth?      

89
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,249
          - It hurts.           

90
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:13,184
   - You want some Ibuprofen?   

91
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:14,052
             - Nah.             

92
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:19,157
Look, I know you've been trying.

93
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:22,727
 And I really do appreciate it. 

94
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:26,164
   - I love you sis, and I'm    
 sorry I didn't always show it, 

95
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,265
           but, I do.           

96
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:30,602
        - I'm sorry too.        

97
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:35,507
       - You have nothing       
        to be sorry for.        

98
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:38,443
    - Look at what I found.     

99
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:44,449
 - Oh my God, look at my hair.  

100
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:48,720
         - Yeah it was          
      definitely the 90s.       

101
00:09:48,722 --> 00:09:50,388
  - We look like Kid 'n Play.   

102
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,791
           (laughing)           

103
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,627
        - I missed you.         

104
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:57,195
      - I missed you too.       

105
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:04,636
      - I wanna go to bed.      

106
00:10:04,638 --> 00:10:05,437
            - Okay.             

107
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,438
         - Good night.          

108
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,305
            - Night.            

109
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:37,168
    - [Ghostly Voice] Mommy?    

110
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:40,071
        (ominous music)         

111
00:10:49,116 --> 00:10:50,215
           - My baby.           

112
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:53,385
           (heaving)            

113
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:16,074
      - [Richard] Ah fuck.      

114
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:20,945
           - Richard?           

115
00:11:20,947 --> 00:11:21,780
           - Morning.           

116
00:11:23,984 --> 00:11:25,517
     - What are you doing?      

117
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,285
   - We've got a busted pipe,   
  came down to make my coffee   

118
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:29,988
   this morning, found myself   
  swimming in the blue lagoon.  

119
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,856
      - This place should       
         be condemned.          

120
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,858
    - It's a water leak, not    
     the end of the world.      

121
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,726
            - Sorry.            

122
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:39,030
       - I gotta go out,        
     pick up a few things,      

123
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,466
     are you gonna be okay      
    on your own for a while?    

124
00:11:41,468 --> 00:11:44,903
- Yeah I'm not a child Richard. 

125
00:11:44,905 --> 00:11:46,071
 - I didn't mean it like that.  

126
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:47,138
          - It's okay.          

127
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:49,674
      - I just wanna make       
        sure, you know.         

128
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:51,209
            - Yeah.             

129
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,311
        - Can I get you         
    anything while I'm out.     

130
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:54,412
           - Coffee.            

131
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:57,882
   - Okay, I'll make us some    
   breakfast when I get back.   

132
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:59,250
        - [Sarah] Okay.         

133
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:12,330
        (ominous music)         

134
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:22,874
       - [Woman] Richie?        

135
00:12:22,876 --> 00:12:24,275
          - Excuse me.          

136
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:27,212
  - Richie Doyle, it's me, Jan  
  Thompson, you went to school  

137
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:28,913
     with my boys, I was a      
    friend of your mother's.    

138
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:31,249
    - Oh Mrs. Thompson, hi.     

139
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,918
       - Hi, oh it is so        
        good to see you.        

140
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,253
      - Yeah, same to you.      

141
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,188
- What brings you back to Globe?

142
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,791
     - Ah, I guess we just      
       missed the place.        

143
00:12:39,793 --> 00:12:42,360
 And I thought Sarah could use  
 a little country living again. 

144
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:44,195
     - Oh Sarah's back too,     
      oh that's wonderful,      

145
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:46,331
   I have to stop in on her.    

146
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:55,039
         Molly Hanning,         
      she's a little uhm--      

147
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,374
           - Strange?           

148
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:58,276
 - You said it, not me, anyway  
    I don't wanna keep you,     

149
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,211
       but it is so nice        
       to see you again.        

150
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:01,613
           - You too.           

151
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:02,680
          - Take care.          

152
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:07,852
        (ominous music)         

153
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:43,288
   - One half through two, to   
   one quarter to an eighth.    

154
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,923
    - Always the hard part.     

155
00:13:44,925 --> 00:13:46,324
         - What's that?         

156
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,660
    - Finding the right fit.    

157
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:51,362
       Every part has its       
        perfect counter.        

158
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:55,066
     But finding that match     
      is what takes time.       

159
00:13:57,304 --> 00:13:58,503
         - Yeah, sure.          

160
00:14:08,615 --> 00:14:11,482
      I uh, I need copies       
       of these two keys.       

161
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:13,852
  - All right, back in a sec.   

162
00:14:23,496 --> 00:14:25,063
    - I'm sorry, can I help     
      you with something?       

163
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:28,533
      - Maybe, or maybe I       
     can help you, Richard.     

164
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:31,502
         - Have we met?         

165
00:14:31,504 --> 00:14:34,372
     - You lost your niece      
      last year Mr. Doyle.      

166
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:35,473
        - That's right.         

167
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:38,509
     - She was sick but to      
     go so fast like that,      

168
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:42,547
 what was it again, got herself 
    drowned, in the bathtub?    

169
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:46,317
  - I don't know who the hell   
 you are but stay away from me. 

170
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:48,086
    - Come on Mr. Doyle you     
   know something's not right   

171
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:51,356
   with her story, Adam knew    
  it, he felt it in his bones.  

172
00:14:51,358 --> 00:14:53,892
- I'm not gonna tell you again. 

173
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:58,162
 - Okay, with the bolts and the 
  keys, that's gonna be 12.55.  

174
00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:19,284
          - Who is it?          

175
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:22,921
 - It's Jan Thompson, from next 
  door, this is my friend Amy.  

176
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:26,624
       Is this a bad time       
         for you Sarah?         

177
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:28,459
        - Mrs. Thompson.        

178
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:31,596
      - Well look at you,       
      you're so beautiful.      

179
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,798
    I always knew you'd grow    
   up to be a heart breaker.    

180
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,968
       - You're so sweet,       
       please come on in.       

181
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:42,440
      - Apple pie for you.      

182
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,742
- Thank you, you shouldn't have.

183
00:15:44,744 --> 00:15:47,045
 - Oh it's a store bought kind  
   but still I just love 'em.   

184
00:15:47,047 --> 00:15:48,446
     This is my friend Amy.     

185
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:49,247
           - Hi Amy.            

186
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:50,548
     - Hi nice to meet you.     

187
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,549
       - Would you ladies       
      like to have a seat?      

188
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,284
       - Well thank you.        
            - Sure.             

189
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:54,953
         - I'm so sorry         
      about all the boxes,      

190
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:57,989
   I haven't really gotten a    
  handle on the unpacking yet.  

191
00:15:57,991 --> 00:15:59,424
       - Ah, not at all.        

192
00:15:59,426 --> 00:16:02,727
  - I haven't had a chance to   
   go shopping yet, but, uhm,   

193
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:04,495
       I was just making        
        some herbal tea.        

194
00:16:04,497 --> 00:16:07,498
 - Tea would be lovely, except  
   no sugar or cream for me,    

195
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,435
   doctor says I gotta watch    
   the sweets and the dairy.    

196
00:16:10,437 --> 00:16:12,337
- Yeah, plain's fine for me too.

197
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:14,706
 - [Sarah] I'll be right back.  

198
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:19,844
        - Ah, who's this        
       lovely young lady?       

199
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:21,145
   - [Sarah] I'm sorry what?    

200
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,613
       - Look at her Amy,       
      isn't she adorable.       

201
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:24,215
       - Oh yeah she is.        

202
00:16:25,952 --> 00:16:27,618
        - Is she yours?         

203
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,020
    Well I can tell you for     
  schools, you're gonna wanna   

204
00:16:29,022 --> 00:16:32,590
  avoid Roosevelt, but Chapman  
  has a great little program,   

205
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:34,459
       I'm on the school        
    board there, so I can--     

206
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:37,829
        - Lizzy actually        
     passed away last year.     

207
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:41,065
      - Oh, I'm so sorry.       

208
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:43,901
         - That's fine.         

209
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,706
          - Thank you.          

210
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,341
     (sudden ominous sting)     
           (gasping)            

211
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,643
  Oh God, get it off of me, my  
 cross, get it off, get it off! 

212
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:55,213
 Get it off, get it off of me!  

213
00:16:55,215 --> 00:16:57,715
          (screaming)           

214
00:16:58,618 --> 00:17:00,284
    (ghostly voice speaking     
       foreign language)        

215
00:17:00,286 --> 00:17:02,220
             - God!             
 - Are you hurt what happened?  

216
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:04,288
     - It was the weirdest      
  thing, I, all of the sudden   

217
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:06,691
         I felt like my         
       chest was on fire.       

218
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:07,759
          - Oh my God.          

219
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:13,731
    - [Sarah] Here, please.     

220
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:16,501
    - No, no it's fine, I'm     
 fine, no it's fine, I'm fine,  

221
00:17:16,503 --> 00:17:18,403
     thank you I'm leaving.     
          - It's fine.          

222
00:17:18,405 --> 00:17:19,637
        - I am so sorry!        

223
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:25,043
       (foreboding music)       

224
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:51,569
   (ghostly voice murmuring)    

225
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,816
   (ghostly voice murmuring)    
          (screaming)           

226
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:42,720
       (glass shattering)       
          (screaming)           

227
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:45,957
      (door slamming shut)      
          (screaming)           

228
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:46,958
          Let me out!           

229
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:49,827
            Richard!            

230
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:51,963
       - [Richard] Sarah?       

231
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:55,066
      - [Sarah] Get me the      
       fuck out of here!        

232
00:18:55,068 --> 00:18:59,504
    - Oh, okay, okay, I got     
     you, I got you, okay.      

233
00:18:59,506 --> 00:19:00,371
            Okay...             

234
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,583
        You feel better?        

235
00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:14,685
   - No I don't feel better.    

236
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:17,255
     - Okay just calm down.     

237
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:19,790
    - I don't like it here,     
    there's something wrong     

238
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:21,259
        with this place.        

239
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:25,163
- So what has happened exactly? 

240
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,002
       A broken doorknob,       
      a popped light bulb.      

241
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:34,305
   It seems to me we're just    
    like par for the course,    

242
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:37,675
        when living in a        
     broken down old house.     

243
00:19:41,114 --> 00:19:44,382
      Look, you're tired,       
     you're stressed out--      

244
00:19:44,384 --> 00:19:46,050
   - So I'm imagining things?   

245
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:48,219
   - Okay I didn't say that.    

246
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:53,724
 It's just, you've been through 
   hell, and with the stress    

247
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:57,395
  of the move, I just want you  
  to look at this objectively   

248
00:19:57,397 --> 00:19:58,963
      for a second, okay.       

249
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,301
   Shitty old house, with bad   
   plumbing and rusty knobs,    

250
00:20:03,303 --> 00:20:07,071
    or our mother's house is    
suddenly haunted after 30 years.

251
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:10,942
    - No, you weren't there,    
     you didn't see the...      

252
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:17,248
       Last night, when I       
     was taking a bath I...     

253
00:20:23,523 --> 00:20:25,756
  Maybe I am imagining things.  

254
00:20:28,494 --> 00:20:30,761
     - Let's go somewhere.      

255
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:32,163
        - Go somewhere?         

256
00:20:32,165 --> 00:20:34,665
   - Yeah, anywhere, I don't    
  know, some place that isn't   

257
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:36,467
      this fucking house.       

258
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,336
            - Yeah.             

259
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:43,774
      Just uhm, let me go       
    freshen up really quick.    

260
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:00,258
        (ominous music)         

261
00:21:27,587 --> 00:21:29,453
        - Hi folks what         
       can I get for you?       

262
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:31,255
          - Club soda.          
          - Club soda.          

263
00:21:31,257 --> 00:21:34,325
 - A Coors Light draft please.  
            - Okay.             

264
00:21:35,728 --> 00:21:40,164
    - God this place brings     
    back a lot of memories.     

265
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:43,768
       - Not for me, that       
    might be the blackouts.     

266
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:46,003
      - Are you sure that       
    you're okay being here?     

267
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:49,140
- Yeah, yeah it's not a problem.

268
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:52,076
  As long as they serve soda.   

269
00:21:52,078 --> 00:21:53,778
  - How long has it been now?   

270
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,913
   - Seven years next month.    

271
00:21:57,083 --> 00:22:00,351
       - Congratulations,       
     that's, that's great.      

272
00:22:01,754 --> 00:22:04,989
      - One day at a time,      
   that's what they tell me.    

273
00:22:11,631 --> 00:22:12,496
            - What?             

274
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:17,034
     - Here you go, that'll     
    be 4.50 unless you guys     

275
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:18,669
       wanna open a tab.        

276
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:20,905
        - Hey, Richard.         

277
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:25,976
   - Oh, I'm sorry, just uh,    
     just throw us the tab.     

278
00:22:25,978 --> 00:22:27,144
            - Okay.             

279
00:22:27,146 --> 00:22:28,913
      - Hey are you okay?       

280
00:22:29,949 --> 00:22:32,249
 - Yeah, I'm fine, that's all.  

281
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:38,622
       (foreboding music)       

282
00:22:40,893 --> 00:22:43,194
           (heaving)            

283
00:22:50,803 --> 00:22:54,138
    (ghostly voice speaking     
      in foreign language)      

284
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:58,409
    ¶ Take the key and lock     
      her up, my fair lady      

285
00:22:59,812 --> 00:23:04,081
   ¶ London Bridge is falling   
down, falling down, falling down

286
00:23:05,651 --> 00:23:09,920
       ¶ London Bridge is       
   falling down, my fair lady   

287
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:19,263
            - Lizzy?            

288
00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:22,166
        Lizzy, it's you!        

289
00:23:26,272 --> 00:23:29,974
     I thought I was never      
      gonna see you again.      

290
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,177
   I have missed you so much.   

291
00:24:01,474 --> 00:24:03,974
  - Sarah, what are you doing?  

292
00:24:16,389 --> 00:24:19,723
      You wanna go inside,      
      it's nice and warm.       

293
00:24:19,725 --> 00:24:20,558
            Come on.            

294
00:24:34,674 --> 00:24:36,040
       Just take a seat.        

295
00:24:47,854 --> 00:24:49,220
       - My little girl.        

296
00:24:52,358 --> 00:24:53,491
            - What?             

297
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:56,327
- She wants me to play with her.

298
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:59,663
         She came back          
     because she needs me.      

299
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:00,130
       - It was a dream.        

300
00:25:04,036 --> 00:25:07,137
     Did you forget to take     
    your medication tonight.    

301
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:09,940
    Or well, maybe mixing it    
   with beer was a bad idea?    

302
00:25:09,942 --> 00:25:11,709
     - What, no I saw her.      

303
00:25:13,946 --> 00:25:14,845
         - You saw her?         

304
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:16,981
   - I know that she's here.    

305
00:25:16,983 --> 00:25:17,882
           - Sarah--            

306
00:25:17,884 --> 00:25:20,284
- No, Richard it was Elizabeth. 

307
00:25:24,957 --> 00:25:27,525
 - Okay, let's get to bed huh?  

308
00:25:44,243 --> 00:25:47,144
        (phone ringing)         

309
00:25:51,651 --> 00:25:52,983
             Hello?             

310
00:25:52,985 --> 00:25:55,586
   - [Man] Saw you at the bar   
 tonight, sorry I had to leave  

311
00:25:55,588 --> 00:25:56,654
          so suddenly.          

312
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:01,091
  - How'd you get this number?  

313
00:26:01,093 --> 00:26:03,561
   - [Man] Sister started to    
  backslide, you had a chance   

314
00:26:03,563 --> 00:26:07,164
       to stay out of it,       
     but now it's too late.     

315
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:10,034
        - What, are you         
    fucking threatening us?     

316
00:26:10,036 --> 00:26:13,137
      - [Man] She belongs       
         to us Richard.         

317
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:17,841
 - All right you listen to me.  

318
00:26:17,843 --> 00:26:21,211
   If I see you within a mile   
     of my sister I will...     

319
00:26:21,213 --> 00:26:22,112
         Hello, hello?          

320
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:25,149
            Fucker!             

321
00:26:30,189 --> 00:26:32,523
           (rumbling)           

322
00:27:48,968 --> 00:27:51,902
       (foreboding music)       

323
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,506
    Wow geez you scared me.     

324
00:28:29,508 --> 00:28:32,142
  - I need to speak with you.   

325
00:28:32,144 --> 00:28:33,243
     - Are you just getting     
      tired of watching me      

326
00:28:33,245 --> 00:28:34,411
       from your window?        

327
00:28:34,413 --> 00:28:37,014
   - It's about your sister.    

328
00:28:37,016 --> 00:28:38,382
       - What about her?        

329
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:40,050
    - You need to leave this    
   place and never come back.   

330
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:41,151
           - Really?            

331
00:28:41,153 --> 00:28:43,687
    - As long as you remain     
    in that house with her,     

332
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:45,155
        you're not safe.        

333
00:28:45,157 --> 00:28:46,490
   - You're friends with that   
    asshole who called me in    

334
00:28:46,492 --> 00:28:47,725
    the middle of the night?    

335
00:28:47,727 --> 00:28:50,661
       (foreboding music)       

336
00:29:32,872 --> 00:29:35,873
     - It's hard to explain     
   but there's this presence    

337
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:38,742
 within her, within that house. 

338
00:29:38,744 --> 00:29:40,210
     - Okay I have no idea      
    what you're playing at,     

339
00:29:40,212 --> 00:29:42,312
       but I've heard all       
      I'm gonna listen to.      

340
00:29:42,314 --> 00:29:43,714
      - You can not drink       
    from the cup of the lord    

341
00:29:43,716 --> 00:29:46,049
     and the cup of demon.      

342
00:29:46,051 --> 00:29:47,451
     You cannot partake of      
     the table of the table     

343
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:49,853
  and the table of the demon.   

344
00:29:50,656 --> 00:29:53,323
- Just get help lady, seriously.

345
00:29:54,894 --> 00:29:59,163
          (whimpering)          
        (ominous music)         

346
00:30:02,735 --> 00:30:04,334
             Sarah?             

347
00:30:04,336 --> 00:30:05,669
     - It was an accident.      

348
00:30:05,671 --> 00:30:08,505
    - Jesus fucking Christ,     
  you're cutting yourself now?  

349
00:30:08,507 --> 00:30:10,007
       Sarah what are you       
       doing to yourself?       

350
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:11,492
     - It was an accident.      

351
00:30:11,493 --> 00:30:12,976
    - [Richard] Oh I'm sure     
   it was, I have to take you   
       to an emergency--        

352
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:14,244
           - Get out!           

353
00:30:14,246 --> 00:30:17,147
       - Sarah, oh fuck,        
     Sarah come back here!      

354
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:19,183
            Ah fuck.            

355
00:30:21,687 --> 00:30:23,320
      Sarah open the door.      

356
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:24,955
         (door banging)         

357
00:30:24,957 --> 00:30:27,357
  Sarah, Sarah open the door.   

358
00:30:29,662 --> 00:30:31,261
   That's it I'm calling 911.   

359
00:30:31,263 --> 00:30:32,996
     - Just leave me alone.     

360
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:34,965
    - You want an ambulance     
   here, cops, because that's   

361
00:30:34,967 --> 00:30:37,267
   what's gonna happen if you   
    don't unlock this door.     

362
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:38,569
       Hey, you hear me?        

363
00:30:40,272 --> 00:30:42,372
     That's it I'm dialing.     

364
00:30:45,277 --> 00:30:47,578
          (whimpering)          

365
00:30:55,654 --> 00:30:57,554
 - This is ridiculous Richard.  

366
00:30:57,556 --> 00:30:59,289
      - Tell me about it.       

367
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,392
         - Sarah Doyle?         

368
00:31:02,394 --> 00:31:03,560
         - Right here.          

369
00:31:14,707 --> 00:31:18,375
  - Why don't you have a seat   
   upon the bed for me Sarah.   

370
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:21,678
      Let's see what we're      
        looking at here.        

371
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,413
     - It was an accident.      

372
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,916
 - I'm not so sure about that.  

373
00:31:25,918 --> 00:31:27,251
     - Go to hell Richard.      

374
00:31:27,253 --> 00:31:28,919
      - Go to hell, you're      
      mutilating yourself.      

375
00:31:28,921 --> 00:31:30,487
         - [Nurse] Sir!         

376
00:31:30,489 --> 00:31:31,388
     - And she needs to be      
  committed for her own sake,   

377
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,756
 she's trying to kill herself.  

378
00:31:32,758 --> 00:31:35,392
         - Please, sir          
      you're not helping.       

379
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:37,928
 Maybe you should wait outside. 

380
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:39,429
        - Yeah maybe so.        

381
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:45,602
    - Hon, is that true, are    
  you trying to hurt yourself?  

382
00:31:45,604 --> 00:31:48,171
     - It was an accident.      

383
00:31:48,173 --> 00:31:51,008
        - Well let's see        
       what we got here.        

384
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:54,511
    And you did this today?     

385
00:31:54,513 --> 00:31:56,013
            - Yeah.             

386
00:31:56,015 --> 00:31:58,282
   - Judging by the scabbing,   
      I'm guessing you had      

387
00:31:58,284 --> 00:32:00,550
      your accident about       
         two weeks ago.         

388
00:32:00,552 --> 00:32:01,919
      You really should've      
    come in and see us when     

389
00:32:01,921 --> 00:32:05,255
      this happened, it's       
     too late for stitches.     

390
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:08,792
      This is gonna leave       
    one nasty looking scar.     

391
00:32:19,705 --> 00:32:21,405
    - [Richard] Father Burk?    

392
00:32:21,407 --> 00:32:22,739
             - Yes.             

393
00:32:22,741 --> 00:32:24,708
   - Ah you know, it's fine I   
 have rounds to finish anyway,  

394
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:25,876
     so I'll see you later.     

395
00:32:25,878 --> 00:32:27,477
         - Okay, okay.          

396
00:32:27,479 --> 00:32:31,048
      - Uh, Richard Doyle,      
    St. Martin's Basketball.    

397
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:34,384
  - Oh sure I knew your mother  
  real well, and your sister,   

398
00:32:34,386 --> 00:32:35,419
        what's her name?        

399
00:32:35,421 --> 00:32:36,386
            - Sarah.            

400
00:32:36,388 --> 00:32:38,155
      - Sarah how is she?       

401
00:32:39,825 --> 00:32:40,691
            - Uhm...            

402
00:32:44,396 --> 00:32:47,230
   Not good father, just not    
 good, she's kind of the reason 

403
00:32:47,232 --> 00:32:48,065
           I'm here.            

404
00:32:49,601 --> 00:32:53,670
    Uhm, she's been cutting     
   herself, and she tells me    

405
00:32:54,606 --> 00:32:56,974
      it was an accident,       
     but I have my doubts.      

406
00:32:56,976 --> 00:32:59,509
 - Gee, I'm sorry to hear this. 

407
00:32:59,511 --> 00:33:02,179
     Look I've got to do a      
    mass in the chapel here,    

408
00:33:02,181 --> 00:33:05,349
     in about five minutes,     
    I could see her tonight     

409
00:33:05,351 --> 00:33:08,318
       if you think it'd        
       do her some good.        

410
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,589
  - Uhm, uh, maybe yeah, yeah,  
yeah, yeah that would be great, 

411
00:33:14,426 --> 00:33:16,159
  uhm, we're just, we're over   
   on Brook Street, my mom's    

412
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:17,427
           old house.           

413
00:33:17,429 --> 00:33:19,663
      - Sure, I know just       
    where it is, about 6:30?    

414
00:33:19,665 --> 00:33:22,265
     - 6:30, that's great,      
   thank you so much father,    

415
00:33:22,267 --> 00:33:24,101
        thanks so much.         
     - Okay, you bet, okay.     

416
00:33:24,103 --> 00:33:27,571
     - I really appreciate      
       it father, really.       

417
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:43,453
       You should really        
     try to eat something.      

418
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:49,059
   - I really wish you didn't   
     invite a priest over.      

419
00:33:49,061 --> 00:33:50,861
     - What am I gonna do?      

420
00:33:52,231 --> 00:33:55,298
      I don't know, maybe       
   simply talking to someone    

421
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:58,535
 who isn't me could be of help. 

422
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:00,103
      - I don't need help.      

423
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:04,541
     For the last time, the     
      cut was an accident.      

424
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:07,477
        - Okay, I don't         
      wanna argue, but...       

425
00:34:09,148 --> 00:34:11,214
    Last night, crazy dream.    

426
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:14,885
        (door knocking)         

427
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:16,953
    That's gotta be him now.    

428
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:26,663
       Father thanks for        
    coming, please come in.     

429
00:34:26,665 --> 00:34:28,298
      - Thank you Richard.      

430
00:34:33,205 --> 00:34:34,504
         - [Richard] Ah         
      please have a seat.       

431
00:34:34,506 --> 00:34:37,240
 - Good, good, good, ah thanks. 

432
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:39,176
        - Can I get you         
     anything, coffee, tea?     

433
00:34:39,178 --> 00:34:40,677
- Oh, no, no I'm fine, I'm fine.

434
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:41,578
      - I'll go get Sarah.      

435
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,779
         - Good, good.          

436
00:34:50,722 --> 00:34:51,955
        - Father's here.        

437
00:34:51,957 --> 00:34:54,157
   - Why are you doing this?    

438
00:34:57,563 --> 00:34:59,696
  - He just wants to help you.  

439
00:35:00,532 --> 00:35:02,099
       - Whatever, fine.        

440
00:35:10,642 --> 00:35:12,542
    - Sarah, I don't know if    
    you remember me or not,     

441
00:35:12,544 --> 00:35:13,577
        I'm Father Burk.        

442
00:35:13,579 --> 00:35:14,778
             - Hi.              

443
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,079
         - Your brother         
      Richard here thought      

444
00:35:16,081 --> 00:35:19,583
     that maybe you needed      
      somebody to talk to.      

445
00:35:19,585 --> 00:35:23,487
     - I'm not a religious      
         person father.         

446
00:35:23,489 --> 00:35:25,989
     - That's all right, we     
    can talk about anything.    

447
00:35:25,991 --> 00:35:27,657
     In fact I've been told     
      many times that I'm       

448
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:32,562
    a very good listener, so    
  just relax and take it easy.  

449
00:35:32,564 --> 00:35:37,134
  Would you feel better if we   
  had Richard leave the room?   

450
00:35:37,136 --> 00:35:39,936
     Richard would you mind     
  giving us a little privacy?   

451
00:35:39,938 --> 00:35:43,140
   - Uh, sure, yeah whatever    
       you think is best.       

452
00:35:43,142 --> 00:35:44,007
            - Okay.             

453
00:35:53,619 --> 00:35:56,253
        (ominous music)         

454
00:36:02,161 --> 00:36:04,761
  Now I can't help but notice   
   that bandage on your arm,    

455
00:36:04,763 --> 00:36:06,363
      how did that happen?      

456
00:36:06,365 --> 00:36:07,797
        - I cut myself.         

457
00:36:07,799 --> 00:36:09,933
    - Yeah Richard told me,     
   but he thinks there may be   

458
00:36:09,935 --> 00:36:11,535
          more to it.           

459
00:36:11,537 --> 00:36:14,704
        - I don't really        
      care what he thinks.      

460
00:36:14,706 --> 00:36:17,674
   - Well Richard told me you   
  had trouble sleeping lately,  

461
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:20,043
         that you don't         
      feel like yourself.       

462
00:36:20,045 --> 00:36:23,213
      - I lost my daughter      
     to leukemia last year,     

463
00:36:23,215 --> 00:36:25,682
   and my husband to suicide.   

464
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:28,685
       So, to be honest I       
     can't really remember      

465
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:32,722
    what acting like myself     
   is supposed to look like.    

466
00:36:32,724 --> 00:36:36,526
  - I'm sorry, I didn't know,   
     would you like to talk     

467
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:38,228
        about that some?        

468
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:39,996
 - What is there to talk about? 

469
00:36:39,998 --> 00:36:44,701
     - Well that tremendous     
  hurt that you went through.   

470
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:47,270
Would you let me pray over you? 

471
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:51,041
   Now really you don't have    
     to change your beliefs     

472
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:54,578
   or anything, I just would    
 like to say a prayer over you  

473
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,446
     in the name of Christ.     

474
00:36:59,918 --> 00:37:04,221
    Maybe I'm pushing it too    
 much, I, I do that sometimes.  

475
00:37:06,158 --> 00:37:10,427
  - No I'm, it's okay father,   
   you can say your blessing.   

476
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:14,130
 - All right let's hold hands.  

477
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:18,702
    Heavenly father, we ask     
    for your blessings upon     

478
00:37:18,704 --> 00:37:21,004
      your daughter Sarah.      

479
00:37:21,006 --> 00:37:22,939
    We ask you to protect...    
   (ghostly voice murmuring)    

480
00:37:22,941 --> 00:37:23,740
           (groaning)           

481
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:25,041
          - Oh my God!          

482
00:37:25,043 --> 00:37:27,844
 - Father, hey father you okay? 

483
00:37:27,846 --> 00:37:32,115
    (ghostly voice speaking     
      in foreign language)      

484
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:39,589
      Hey father you okay?      

485
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:40,457
            Father!             

486
00:37:41,893 --> 00:37:42,926
         Hey, you okay?         

487
00:37:47,366 --> 00:37:50,367
    - There's nothing more I    
  can do here, I've got to go.  

488
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:51,901
   - What, hey wait a minute!   

489
00:37:51,903 --> 00:37:54,337
 - [Father Burk] I've gotta go. 

490
00:37:56,875 --> 00:37:58,375
     - Hey, father hold on.     

491
00:37:58,377 --> 00:37:59,809
 - You've gotta get outta here. 

492
00:37:59,811 --> 00:38:01,144
            - What?             

493
00:38:01,146 --> 00:38:02,479
    - There's nothing more I    
    can do for her tonight,     

494
00:38:02,481 --> 00:38:05,148
    but I know a man, he's a    
    professor at the U of A,    

495
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:07,717
       his name is Father       
       Francis Campbell,        

496
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:10,820
   now he's supposed to be an   
 expert at this sort of thing.  

497
00:38:10,822 --> 00:38:12,555
     - What are you talking     
   about, what sort of think?   

498
00:38:12,557 --> 00:38:13,723
         - Possession.          

499
00:38:17,729 --> 00:38:19,596
     - Unbelievable, I turn     
      to this guy for help      

500
00:38:19,598 --> 00:38:23,133
     and he fires back with     
       a bunch of lunacy.       

501
00:38:23,135 --> 00:38:24,434
      We're gonna have to       
       get some real help       

502
00:38:24,436 --> 00:38:25,468
     from an actual mental      
      health professional,      

503
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,904
 not some demented old priest.  

504
00:38:27,906 --> 00:38:30,874
       (foreboding music)       

505
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,228
       What the fuck, you       
      cut yourself again?       

506
00:38:53,465 --> 00:38:54,931
        - Richard don't.        

507
00:38:56,168 --> 00:38:58,101
 - Sarah you are fucking crazy. 

508
00:38:58,103 --> 00:38:59,936
    - You don't understand.     

509
00:39:00,806 --> 00:39:02,105
            I need--            

510
00:39:02,107 --> 00:39:03,506
        - What you need         
       to kill yourself?        

511
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:05,575
    - I need to be with her.    

512
00:39:06,445 --> 00:39:07,644
          She's here.           

513
00:39:07,646 --> 00:39:10,180
    - Oh she's here, Lizzy's    
       here, right okay,        

514
00:39:10,182 --> 00:39:13,450
      Lizzy come out, come      
     out wherever you are.      

515
00:39:13,452 --> 00:39:16,519
   Oh I don't see her Sarah,    
  maybe she's hiding from us,   

516
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:19,789
      right, Lizzy, hello,      
    well she's not in there,    

517
00:39:19,791 --> 00:39:22,692
 maybe in here, no, oh, I know, 

518
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:26,363
      right, she's in the       
    cellar right, yeah okay.    

519
00:39:28,233 --> 00:39:30,934
 Where's my fucking flashlight? 

520
00:39:31,837 --> 00:39:32,869
            Fuck it.            

521
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:34,337
 - Richard don't go down there. 

522
00:39:34,339 --> 00:39:35,205
            Richard!            

523
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:41,378
  - Whoever's in here come on.  

524
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:44,681
    (ghostly voice speaking     
      in foreign language)      

525
00:39:44,683 --> 00:39:47,050
           (groaning)           

526
00:39:48,086 --> 00:39:49,986
      It smells like shit.      

527
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:53,890
     That's great, so along     
      with everything else      

528
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:57,927
    just falling to shit, we    
  got a ruptured sewage line.   

529
00:40:00,699 --> 00:40:04,968
    (ghostly voice speaking     
      in foreign language)      

530
00:40:06,037 --> 00:40:10,073
        (hallowed music)        
        (door knocking)         

531
00:40:17,382 --> 00:40:18,248
             Sarah?             

532
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:25,155
     I don't know how much      
     longer I can do this.      

533
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:32,695
         I'm going out.         

534
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:44,774
       (foreboding music)       

535
00:41:16,408 --> 00:41:20,677
       (glass shattering)       
           (heaving)            

536
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,488
      (car engine revving)      

537
00:41:33,024 --> 00:41:36,759
         (eerie music)          
          (screaming)           

538
00:41:36,761 --> 00:41:39,696
    (ghostly voice speaking     
      in foreign language)      

539
00:41:39,698 --> 00:41:41,498
        - [Lizzy] Mommy?        

540
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,365
            - Lizzy?            

541
00:41:44,636 --> 00:41:46,636
   The doctors said you have    
   to go back to the hospital   

542
00:41:46,638 --> 00:41:48,304
 if you're not eating everyday. 

543
00:41:48,306 --> 00:41:50,273
    She's not responding to     
     the marrow transplant,     

544
00:41:50,275 --> 00:41:51,975
      this isn't something      
      you get better from.      

545
00:41:51,977 --> 00:41:53,209
        - Mom it hurts.         

546
00:41:53,211 --> 00:41:54,544
            - Lizzy?            

547
00:41:54,546 --> 00:41:56,112
    - Well forgive me if I'm    
     not willing to give up     

548
00:41:56,114 --> 00:41:58,147
      on our daughter yet.      

549
00:41:58,149 --> 00:41:59,883
- But I already took one today. 

550
00:41:59,885 --> 00:42:03,419
      - We uh, we need to       
    get you feeling better.     

551
00:42:04,456 --> 00:42:07,023
So we're gonna take a few more. 

552
00:42:11,162 --> 00:42:13,530
 - [Lizzy] I'm so tired Mommy.  

553
00:42:16,167 --> 00:42:18,334
      - It kills its own,       
       she's with us now.       

554
00:42:18,336 --> 00:42:20,803
          (screaming)           

555
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:25,041
 - Get out Lizzy, what are you? 

556
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:26,743
     - It's all your fault.     

557
00:42:26,745 --> 00:42:31,481
          (gun fires)           
          (screaming)           

558
00:42:31,483 --> 00:42:32,815
        - I'm so sorry.         

559
00:42:34,152 --> 00:42:36,252
     - Give yourself to us.     

560
00:42:37,923 --> 00:42:40,890
       It's the only way        
       to stop the pain.        

561
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:49,465
  (ominous anticipatory music)  

562
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:58,241
          (rock music)          

563
00:43:04,015 --> 00:43:06,115
     - What can I get you?      

564
00:43:06,117 --> 00:43:07,550
       - Shot and a beer.       

565
00:43:07,552 --> 00:43:09,886
      - Be more specific?       

566
00:43:09,888 --> 00:43:13,089
      - Whiskey, anything       
     Irish if you have it,      

567
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:14,090
      beer, anything dark.      

568
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:15,191
            - Okay.             

569
00:43:18,964 --> 00:43:21,965
       (foreboding music)       

570
00:43:31,276 --> 00:43:32,442
         - Mrs. Baley?          

571
00:43:34,379 --> 00:43:35,378
          Mrs. Baley?           

572
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:36,279
           - Father?            

573
00:43:36,281 --> 00:43:39,315
- Oh, you scared me Mrs. Baley. 

574
00:43:39,317 --> 00:43:40,917
       I've gotta do some       
       work in the study,       

575
00:43:40,919 --> 00:43:43,152
  would you bring me a scotch.  

576
00:43:43,154 --> 00:43:46,022
       (soft rock music)        

577
00:44:13,251 --> 00:44:14,884
      - One of those days?      

578
00:44:16,454 --> 00:44:18,655
   - You can say that again.    

579
00:44:24,262 --> 00:44:27,196
       - I've never seen        
      you in here before.       

580
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:33,036
 - I don't wanna be rude, I uh, 

581
00:44:34,205 --> 00:44:37,173
    I don't think I'd be the    
    best company right now.     

582
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:39,475
 - I don't know, you show more  
  promise than what's usually   

583
00:44:39,477 --> 00:44:40,410
          found here.           

584
00:44:45,483 --> 00:44:47,183
       - How old are you?       

585
00:44:48,553 --> 00:44:49,719
         - Old enough.          

586
00:44:54,492 --> 00:44:57,360
      - Hey buddy, another      
         whiskey, and,          

587
00:45:00,465 --> 00:45:04,133
     give the lady whatever     
      it is she's having.       

588
00:45:07,038 --> 00:45:10,373
       (foreboding music)       

589
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:13,376
        (phone dialing)         

590
00:45:13,378 --> 00:45:14,977
      - [Father Campbell]       
      Hello you've reached      

591
00:45:14,979 --> 00:45:16,913
    the cellphone of Father     
  Frank Campbell, please leave  

592
00:45:16,915 --> 00:45:18,915
     a message, thank you.      

593
00:45:18,917 --> 00:45:22,151
    - Hi Father Frank, this     
     is Father James Burk.      

594
00:45:22,153 --> 00:45:26,155
    We met last year at the     
archbishop's fundraiser shindig.

595
00:45:26,157 --> 00:45:30,693
   Father what I have to say    
  is, well it's unbelievable,   

596
00:45:30,695 --> 00:45:33,529
      I paid a visit to a       
   former parishioner of mine   

597
00:45:33,531 --> 00:45:37,567
     named Sarah Doyle, and     
      there's no easy way       

598
00:45:37,569 --> 00:45:40,303
        to say this, but        
        I saw something.        

599
00:45:41,439 --> 00:45:43,773
      And it spoke to me,       
       I need you call me       

600
00:45:43,775 --> 00:45:46,943
    as soon as you get this,    
      please it's urgent,       

601
00:45:46,945 --> 00:45:49,512
      I can't stress that       
  enough, and my phone number   

602
00:45:49,514 --> 00:45:50,980
        is 632-592-6789.        

603
00:45:54,252 --> 00:45:58,321
    Please, call me as soon     
    as you get this message.    

604
00:46:06,431 --> 00:46:08,064
          Mrs. Baley.           

605
00:46:08,066 --> 00:46:09,499
       - She's gone home.       

606
00:46:10,969 --> 00:46:14,604
    - Who are you, and what     
   are you doing in my home?    

607
00:46:24,582 --> 00:46:25,448
            - Whew.             

608
00:46:26,718 --> 00:46:28,217
        - You're really         
       putting 'em down.        

609
00:46:28,219 --> 00:46:30,286
      - Yes, I really am.       

610
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:32,221
       How many is that?        

611
00:46:32,223 --> 00:46:35,291
       Fuck I don't care,       
       hey, uh, another!        

612
00:46:37,262 --> 00:46:38,961
       - In for a penny,        
        in for a pound.         

613
00:46:38,963 --> 00:46:43,766
    - Yes, let it wash away     
      the sins (mumbling).      

614
00:46:43,768 --> 00:46:46,302
- So, you wanna get outta here? 

615
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:51,140
  - Really, I mean, I mean...   

616
00:46:53,344 --> 00:46:54,977
             Yeah.              

617
00:46:54,979 --> 00:46:58,014
- Think you can follow the road?

618
00:46:58,016 --> 00:47:00,383
 - Well I guess we'll find out. 

619
00:47:01,419 --> 00:47:05,488
I just gotta, (mumbling) first. 

620
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:32,415
       - Quite the looker       
         you got there.         

621
00:47:33,384 --> 00:47:34,617
         - What's that?         

622
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:36,953
  - Just saying good for you.   

623
00:47:38,489 --> 00:47:40,756
   Having a little backslide?   

624
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:44,727
       Hanging under the        
       wagon isn't easy.        

625
00:47:47,031 --> 00:47:50,032
   Looks like Sister Sarah is   
    starting to come around.    

626
00:47:50,034 --> 00:47:52,168
     Finally ready to admit     
   little Lizzy had some help   

627
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:54,470
 filling her lungs with water.  

628
00:47:55,673 --> 00:47:59,075
      You should ask her,       
      she'll tell you now.      

629
00:48:03,681 --> 00:48:06,515
 - Are you following me again?  

630
00:48:06,517 --> 00:48:08,084
      - Always Mr. Doyle.       

631
00:48:09,554 --> 00:48:11,387
      Always and forever.       

632
00:48:15,526 --> 00:48:20,062
   That's it Mr. Doyle, good,   
  let it out, let it all out.   

633
00:48:20,064 --> 00:48:21,197
    - I fucking warned you.     

634
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:23,199
           (groaning)           
          (scuffling)           

635
00:48:23,201 --> 00:48:24,834
     Who the hell are you,      
   why are you following me?    

636
00:48:24,836 --> 00:48:27,036
  Tell me who you really are,   
    what the fuck you want?     

637
00:48:27,038 --> 00:48:29,906
    - I want you to be a man    
   for once, take that pretty   

638
00:48:29,908 --> 00:48:32,208
     little thing out there     
       back to your place       

639
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:34,277
    and fuck her brains out.    

640
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:38,581
   - If I ever see you again,   
     I'll fucking kill you.     

641
00:48:38,583 --> 00:48:40,716
      Call me, or mention       
      or my sister again--      

642
00:48:40,718 --> 00:48:43,686
        - You'll fucking        
       kill me, I got it.       

643
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:47,423
 - Yeah he's been following me. 

644
00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:48,291
             Fuck!              

645
00:48:52,897 --> 00:48:54,363
          I gotta go.           

646
00:48:54,365 --> 00:48:55,197
           - Oh hey.            

647
00:48:56,567 --> 00:48:58,634
    - Maybe some other time.    

648
00:49:01,406 --> 00:49:04,040
        (ominous music)         

649
00:49:05,243 --> 00:49:06,108
           - Father?            

650
00:49:07,278 --> 00:49:09,145
     I'm sorry but I forgot     
     my dang phone charger,     

651
00:49:09,147 --> 00:49:12,315
     and Lord knows if I'm      
       not reachable I...       

652
00:49:12,317 --> 00:49:13,549
            Father?             

653
00:49:13,551 --> 00:49:17,153
     - Whoever believes in      
      me shall never die.       

654
00:49:22,427 --> 00:49:24,760
          (screaming)           

655
00:49:24,762 --> 00:49:27,797
        (door knocking)         

656
00:49:27,799 --> 00:49:30,800
       (foreboding music)       

657
00:49:57,028 --> 00:49:59,895
        - How'd you know        
       where to find me?        

658
00:50:01,466 --> 00:50:04,000
         (soft moaning)         

659
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:07,436
            (gasps)             

660
00:50:07,438 --> 00:50:09,505
 - Never in lust I've conceived 
     to bringeth forth sin      

661
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:13,542
 and sin, when it is finished,  
     bringeth forth death.      

662
00:50:15,013 --> 00:50:17,513
    Even when I walk through    
   a valley of deep darkness,   

663
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:21,550
     I shall not be afraid,     
      for you are with me.      

664
00:50:21,552 --> 00:50:22,785
        You are with me!        

665
00:50:23,888 --> 00:50:28,190
       (thunder rumbling)       
           (heaving)            

666
00:50:29,494 --> 00:50:31,761
           (moaning)            

667
00:51:07,065 --> 00:51:08,164
       - [Richard] Sarah?       

668
00:51:08,166 --> 00:51:09,832
         Get off of me!         

669
00:51:09,834 --> 00:51:12,234
           (laughing)           

670
00:51:13,504 --> 00:51:16,005
      - What's the matter,      
      isn't it everything       

671
00:51:16,007 --> 00:51:18,274
 you always hoped it would be?  

672
00:51:18,276 --> 00:51:20,843
 - What did you do to yourself? 

673
00:51:20,845 --> 00:51:23,512
       - We're gonna have       
        a baby Richard.         

674
00:51:23,514 --> 00:51:27,783
           (laughing)           
      (anticipatory music)      

675
00:51:31,722 --> 00:51:34,623
      (car engine revving)      

676
00:51:36,094 --> 00:51:38,594
    - I (mumbling) my Lord,     
    my God, I pray up to you    

677
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:42,865
    to hear me, (mumbling),     
    hear me and protect me.     

678
00:51:44,302 --> 00:51:46,202
       (thunder rumbling)       

679
00:51:46,204 --> 00:51:48,671
          (screaming)           

680
00:51:51,275 --> 00:51:55,544
           (heaving)            
          (screaming)           

681
00:52:05,656 --> 00:52:08,657
       (thunder rumbling)       

682
00:52:18,002 --> 00:52:20,202
   - Hey you alive in there?    

683
00:52:24,842 --> 00:52:26,242
            - What?             

684
00:52:26,244 --> 00:52:27,877
      - Are you all right?      

685
00:52:28,746 --> 00:52:30,412
         - Who are you?         

686
00:52:30,414 --> 00:52:34,283
     - It's my house you're     
      parked in front of.       

687
00:52:34,285 --> 00:52:35,151
             - Oh.              

688
00:52:36,087 --> 00:52:37,987
     - [Man] You're drunk?      

689
00:52:37,989 --> 00:52:38,854
             - No.              

690
00:52:40,324 --> 00:52:43,893
  - Well look, you're blocking  
 my driveway, you mind moving?  

691
00:52:44,762 --> 00:52:46,428
   - [Richard] What the hell?   

692
00:52:46,430 --> 00:52:50,299
  - Are you gonna move or am I  
  gonna have to call the cops?  

693
00:52:50,301 --> 00:52:53,502
      (car engine revving)      

694
00:52:55,273 --> 00:52:56,105
            Asshole.            

695
00:53:04,182 --> 00:53:05,447
         - Father Burk.         

696
00:53:07,652 --> 00:53:10,019
 Father Burk, it's Rich Doyle.  

697
00:53:11,355 --> 00:53:14,023
        (phone ringing)         

698
00:53:19,964 --> 00:53:21,397
             Hello?             

699
00:53:21,399 --> 00:53:22,831
- [Man] He's not there, Richard.

700
00:53:22,833 --> 00:53:24,166
            - What?             

701
00:53:24,168 --> 00:53:28,170
   - [Man] Crazy old fool cut   
 his own tongue out last night. 

702
00:53:28,172 --> 00:53:30,639
 - This was you, you did this.  

703
00:53:30,641 --> 00:53:32,041
   - [Man] I'm just a voice.    

704
00:53:32,043 --> 00:53:36,645
 A messenger, and my message to 
 you is to stop fighting this.  

705
00:53:36,647 --> 00:53:38,214
- Well that's not gonna happen. 

706
00:53:38,216 --> 00:53:41,417
      (anticipatory music)      

707
00:53:50,995 --> 00:53:52,561
     - Can I help you sir?      

708
00:53:52,563 --> 00:53:54,396
   - I'm not sure if you can,   
 do you have Father James Burk  

709
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:55,431
    as one of your patients?    

710
00:53:55,433 --> 00:53:56,665
        - Excuse me sir.        

711
00:53:56,667 --> 00:53:57,700
            - Yeah?             

712
00:53:57,702 --> 00:53:59,001
        - You're looking        
        for Father Burk.        

713
00:53:59,003 --> 00:54:00,569
        - That's right.         

714
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:02,705
  - I'm Dr. Cathy Monroe, I'm   
    Father Burk's attending.    

715
00:54:02,707 --> 00:54:07,343
 Father Burk's been incredibly  
  insistent that we find you.   

716
00:54:07,345 --> 00:54:09,078
- How did you know where I was? 

717
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:12,648
       - Lucky guess, are       
     you a relative of his?     

718
00:54:13,618 --> 00:54:15,784
   - No, uh, friend I guess.    

719
00:54:17,288 --> 00:54:19,855
    - Okay well, follow me.     

720
00:54:19,857 --> 00:54:22,825
       (foreboding music)       

721
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:29,198
      (machinery beeping)       

722
00:54:30,701 --> 00:54:31,800
           - Father?            

723
00:54:35,706 --> 00:54:39,975
- Can you shed any light on why 
  he would do this to himself?  

724
00:54:51,922 --> 00:54:53,889
    What, what does it say.     

725
00:54:54,825 --> 00:54:56,125
    - Find Father Campbell.     

726
00:54:56,127 --> 00:54:57,293
         - Who's that?          

727
00:54:58,896 --> 00:55:02,564
      (machinery beeping)       

728
00:55:02,566 --> 00:55:04,166
         - I gotta go.          

729
00:55:04,168 --> 00:55:05,734
       - Hey, Mr. Doyle!        

730
00:55:07,772 --> 00:55:10,706
       (foreboding music)       

731
00:55:12,009 --> 00:55:16,078
(screaming in foreign language) 

732
00:55:24,288 --> 00:55:27,856
     - I cast you out, out      
      in the name of God!       

733
00:55:30,328 --> 00:55:33,262
       Riddley go ahead,        
       Riddley go ahead.        

734
00:55:36,867 --> 00:55:39,001
    Now this concludes what     
      we can submit to you      

735
00:55:39,003 --> 00:55:40,936
     as documented evidence     
        of the existence        

736
00:55:40,938 --> 00:55:42,671
     of demonic phenomena.      

737
00:55:42,673 --> 00:55:44,707
     Now, I know what many      
      of you are thinking,      

738
00:55:44,709 --> 00:55:46,842
   and you're right, there's    
 nothing that you haven't seen  

739
00:55:46,844 --> 00:55:49,945
    or heard here today that    
   couldn't be explained away   

740
00:55:49,947 --> 00:55:52,781
     by a more conventional     
          explanation.          

741
00:55:52,783 --> 00:55:54,983
     Sadly, the only way to     
    truly convince a skeptic    

742
00:55:54,985 --> 00:55:57,519
     of our findings is to      
      have you come along       

743
00:55:57,521 --> 00:56:00,456
        the next time we        
   encounter one of these...    

744
00:56:00,458 --> 00:56:03,726
       And, no, we don't        
      give exorcism tours.      

745
00:56:04,862 --> 00:56:05,728
           - Why not?           

746
00:56:06,864 --> 00:56:09,531
       - Oh, well that's        
        a fair question.        

747
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:11,200
   And the answer is simple.    

748
00:56:11,202 --> 00:56:13,068
   Once the demonic presence    
      leaves the possessed      

749
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:16,472
  it doesn't simply vanish or   
return from where it came from, 

750
00:56:16,474 --> 00:56:18,974
    like any other parasite     
     deprived of its host,      

751
00:56:18,976 --> 00:56:20,909
      it would desperately      
      try to attach itself      

752
00:56:20,911 --> 00:56:22,644
 to something or someone else.  

753
00:56:22,646 --> 00:56:24,613
    - Okay, something else?     

754
00:56:26,016 --> 00:56:27,883
  - Yes, in certain instances   
     the demonic phenomena      

755
00:56:27,885 --> 00:56:30,753
     will attach itself to      
      an inanimate object.      

756
00:56:30,755 --> 00:56:33,522
- (laughs) Like a talking doll? 

757
00:56:33,524 --> 00:56:34,823
           (laughing)           

758
00:56:34,825 --> 00:56:37,893
    - There's nothing funny     
    about demonic phenomena.    

759
00:56:37,895 --> 00:56:39,862
      Now, you can come up      
     with your own theories     

760
00:56:39,864 --> 00:56:42,698
    that you might consider     
  less fantastical to explain   

761
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:47,503
   away our findings, you can   
  call us frauds if you wish,   

762
00:56:47,505 --> 00:56:49,872
     or you can see things      
       for what they are.       

763
00:56:49,874 --> 00:56:53,041
     If you employ a little     
      thing called faith.       

764
00:56:53,043 --> 00:56:53,909
            - Faith?            

765
00:56:55,846 --> 00:56:58,914
       - Yes, I know, the       
     five letter curse word     

766
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:02,684
      to every scientific       
     mind, but, yes, faith.     

767
00:57:02,686 --> 00:57:05,687
  And it's frustrating, but in  
   the age of audio and video   

768
00:57:05,689 --> 00:57:09,024
      recording, it still       
      comes down to that,       

769
00:57:10,227 --> 00:57:12,294
       a matter of faith.       

770
00:57:12,296 --> 00:57:14,530
   - Well that's all we have    
    time for this afternoon,    

771
00:57:14,532 --> 00:57:16,298
    but if you will join me     
     in a round of applause     

772
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:17,866
       for our speakers.        

773
00:57:17,868 --> 00:57:20,202
          (applauding)          

774
00:57:21,272 --> 00:57:22,871
       - Father Francis?        

775
00:57:25,376 --> 00:57:27,209
     I'm uh, Richard Doyle.     

776
00:57:30,114 --> 00:57:32,581
    Father James Burk seemed    
       to think you might       

777
00:57:32,583 --> 00:57:34,550
      be able to help me.       

778
00:57:34,552 --> 00:57:36,752
      - I got a call from       
        him last night.         

779
00:57:36,754 --> 00:57:38,253
     What can I do for you?     

780
00:57:38,255 --> 00:57:40,656
  - It's very hard to say, I,   

781
00:57:42,927 --> 00:57:44,993
       maybe if you could       
       just come with me.       

782
00:57:44,995 --> 00:57:47,095
   - I'm sorry, but I have a    
   six o'clock tomorrow night   

783
00:57:47,097 --> 00:57:49,331
     in Bakersfield, if you     
   wanna make an appointment.   

784
00:57:49,333 --> 00:57:52,000
- No, no, no, no, no, no listen.

785
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:54,736
        This can't wait.        

786
00:57:56,307 --> 00:57:57,573
         - Okay, go on.         

787
00:58:00,277 --> 00:58:02,845
       - I don't know how       
      else to describe it,      

788
00:58:02,847 --> 00:58:05,380
he was trying to help us and... 

789
00:58:07,651 --> 00:58:12,087
   He cut out his own tongue,   
   he, he's in the hospital,    

790
00:58:12,089 --> 00:58:14,556
  he's gone completely insane.  

791
00:58:17,528 --> 00:58:20,596
        - You've seen a         
      demonic haven't you?      

792
00:58:24,201 --> 00:58:27,503
       It's gonna be all        
      right, come with me.      

793
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:34,109
     - Okay, we're all set.     

794
00:58:35,646 --> 00:58:36,678
    - It's okay, just relax.    

795
00:58:40,718 --> 00:58:44,553
 - About a year ago, my sister  
    Sarah lost her daughter,    

796
00:58:44,555 --> 00:58:48,857
  Elizabeth, her husband took   
 his own life a few days later. 

797
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:55,163
  - And how did the child die?  

798
00:58:55,165 --> 00:58:56,198
         - She drowned.         

799
00:58:58,369 --> 00:59:00,435
   - So this was unexpected?    

800
00:59:01,572 --> 00:59:04,306
        - Well sort of,         
       she had leukemia,        

801
00:59:06,043 --> 00:59:09,244
       and the treatments       
        weren't helping.        

802
00:59:12,716 --> 00:59:16,718
    One night she just fell     
     asleep in the bathtub      

803
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,220
        and that was it.        

804
00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:21,623
   I know Adam blamed Sarah.    

805
00:59:25,262 --> 00:59:27,262
            - I see.            

806
00:59:27,263 --> 00:59:29,263
    - So I moved Sarah and I    
  back to our childhood home,   

807
00:59:30,701 --> 00:59:34,836
  I thought maybe the familiar  
    could and help cope with    

808
00:59:34,838 --> 00:59:39,107
 things a bit better, but, she  
  started having these dreams.  

809
00:59:41,045 --> 00:59:43,111
    Nightmares, about Lizzy.    

810
00:59:50,921 --> 00:59:52,854
    Things got a lot worse.     

811
00:59:55,392 --> 00:59:58,260
       She's, she started       
        hearing voices.         

812
00:59:59,229 --> 01:00:01,196
    Lizzy and other voices.     

813
01:00:04,068 --> 01:00:05,901
      And then she started      
        cutting herself.        

814
01:00:05,903 --> 01:00:07,336
       - Cutting herself?       

815
01:00:08,439 --> 01:00:11,840
        - And there were        
     these strange symbols.     

816
01:00:14,545 --> 01:00:16,478
    - What kind of symbols?     

817
01:00:17,815 --> 01:00:22,117
    - I don't know, not like    
anything I've ever seen before. 

818
01:00:28,459 --> 01:00:30,158
       All over her body.       

819
01:00:31,061 --> 01:00:34,296
      She had these scars,      
         like brands of         

820
01:00:38,802 --> 01:00:40,369
      ruins of some kind.       

821
01:00:42,106 --> 01:00:44,239
  - Can you draw them for me?   

822
01:00:45,509 --> 01:00:47,409
   Just do the best you can.    

823
01:00:47,411 --> 01:00:50,379
       (foreboding music)       

824
01:01:11,835 --> 01:01:13,869
    Are you sure about this?    

825
01:01:13,871 --> 01:01:18,173
     - Yeah, I only saw it      
    for a second, but, yeah.    

826
01:01:18,175 --> 01:01:19,041
             - Wow.             

827
01:01:22,846 --> 01:01:25,180
     - That's interesting.      

828
01:01:25,182 --> 01:01:26,048
            - What?             

829
01:01:27,117 --> 01:01:30,852
      - It looks like the       
     second mark of Belial.     

830
01:01:30,854 --> 01:01:32,788
         - What's that?         

831
01:01:32,790 --> 01:01:35,524
    - Well it's rare, in all    
   my life I've only seen it    

832
01:01:35,526 --> 01:01:36,725
         twice before.          

833
01:01:38,295 --> 01:01:40,295
      - What does it mean?      

834
01:01:40,297 --> 01:01:41,997
            - Well.             
            - Well.             

835
01:01:41,999 --> 01:01:44,299
      - According to myth,      
   Belial is one of the seven   

836
01:01:44,301 --> 01:01:46,168
        princes of hell.        

837
01:01:46,170 --> 01:01:48,236
  A creature of immense power   
    with ability to take on     

838
01:01:48,238 --> 01:01:52,040
      many forms, and most      
 commonly among these would be  

839
01:01:52,042 --> 01:01:55,043
  a recently deceased person,   
   which led ancient sources    

840
01:01:55,045 --> 01:01:58,480
     to mistakenly connect      
      him with necromancy.      

841
01:02:00,484 --> 01:02:03,485
      But what concerns me      
      the most about this       

842
01:02:03,487 --> 01:02:05,854
   is that this is the first    
   time I've seen this symbol   

843
01:02:05,856 --> 01:02:09,224
       outside of a 1,200       
      year old manuscript.      

844
01:02:13,997 --> 01:02:15,831
    I think we're gonna have    
   to cancel on Bakersfield.    

845
01:02:15,833 --> 01:02:18,600
        - (scoffs) Yeah.        

846
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:22,337
 - Oh wait, wait there's more.  

847
01:02:22,339 --> 01:02:25,173
        - Yeah, you can         
      tell us on the road.      

848
01:02:25,175 --> 01:02:28,143
       (foreboding music)       

849
01:03:13,557 --> 01:03:16,391
    - I saw heaven standing     
   open and the white horse,    

850
01:03:16,393 --> 01:03:19,227
     whose rider is called      
       faithful and true.       

851
01:03:19,229 --> 01:03:22,397
        With justice he         
     judges and makes war.      

852
01:03:23,734 --> 01:03:25,300
      (door slamming shut)      
           (gasping)            

853
01:03:25,302 --> 01:03:27,402
           (growling)           

854
01:03:28,505 --> 01:03:29,938
    (ghostly voice speaking     
      in foreign language)      

855
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:32,174
    The Lord is my shepherd,    
       I shall not want!        

856
01:03:32,176 --> 01:03:34,242
        He is my savior         
       and my protector.        

857
01:03:34,244 --> 01:03:36,378
           (laughing)           

858
01:03:37,815 --> 01:03:41,883
    - Does it not see, is it    
  blind from all its watching?  

859
01:03:43,754 --> 01:03:48,023
      - Jesus (mumbling),       
     protect me, (mumbling)     

860
01:03:49,493 --> 01:03:51,026
   the power and the glory--    

861
01:03:51,028 --> 01:03:51,993
          (screaming)           

862
01:03:51,995 --> 01:03:53,328
     I shall ever overcome!     

863
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:54,830
   Darkness shall never ever!   

864
01:03:54,832 --> 01:03:57,199
          (screaming)           

865
01:03:57,201 --> 01:03:59,401
           (heaving)            

866
01:04:00,304 --> 01:04:03,438
       - Molly, oh Molly,       
      Molly you freed me!       

867
01:04:04,842 --> 01:04:09,110
 Molly your faith has redeemed  
   and defeated the evil one.   

868
01:04:10,314 --> 01:04:14,516
    Oh praise you and praise    
  God for bringing you to me.   

869
01:04:14,518 --> 01:04:18,720
   - For we are all sinners,    
     and only through him,      

870
01:04:18,722 --> 01:04:20,355
       only through him.        

871
01:04:21,158 --> 01:04:23,024
     - Ssshht, all is well.     

872
01:04:24,494 --> 01:04:26,695
      You have done God's       
      work this day Molly       

873
01:04:26,697 --> 01:04:28,630
    and he is most pleased.     

874
01:04:31,301 --> 01:04:33,435
  But you have seen the evil.   

875
01:04:35,339 --> 01:04:36,771
       And it blinds you.       

876
01:04:41,879 --> 01:04:43,144
         Free yourself.         

877
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:52,787
          (screaming)           

878
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:06,468
       (foreboding music)       

879
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:22,984
          - Follow me.          

880
01:05:31,528 --> 01:05:32,627
           - Richard?           

881
01:05:34,064 --> 01:05:38,333
  We can take it from here if   
you don't wanna go any further. 

882
01:05:39,536 --> 01:05:40,635
           - No, I...           

883
01:05:44,308 --> 01:05:46,441
       I need to do this.       

884
01:05:46,443 --> 01:05:47,542
            - Okay.             

885
01:05:56,219 --> 01:05:58,620
           (groaning)           

886
01:05:59,389 --> 01:06:00,522
         - That smell.          

887
01:06:01,959 --> 01:06:02,824
             Sarah?             

888
01:06:11,234 --> 01:06:14,569
      - Here, rub some of       
     this under your nose.      

889
01:06:19,910 --> 01:06:22,177
       - I guess you guys       
       are used to this?        

890
01:06:22,179 --> 01:06:23,578
       - Strong odors are       
      one of the top tells      

891
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:28,416
  of demonic presence but uh,   
    yeah this is really bad.    

892
01:06:28,418 --> 01:06:29,951
      Usually it emanates       
    from a subterranean area    

893
01:06:29,953 --> 01:06:32,854
like a basement or a crawlspace 
     underneath the house.      

894
01:06:32,856 --> 01:06:34,656
      - Yeah, yeah, that's      
   where I first smelled it,    

895
01:06:34,658 --> 01:06:35,690
     it was in the cellar.      

896
01:06:35,692 --> 01:06:38,493
 - Let's start with the cellar. 

897
01:06:38,495 --> 01:06:41,496
       (foreboding music)       

898
01:07:14,698 --> 01:07:18,967
  (speaking foreign language)   
        (ominous music)         

899
01:07:20,904 --> 01:07:22,704
      - Oh my God, Molly?       

900
01:07:25,242 --> 01:07:29,544
           (groaning)           
            (puking)            

901
01:07:31,081 --> 01:07:32,147
          - Not Sarah?          

902
01:07:33,884 --> 01:07:35,283
        - Our neighbor.         

903
01:07:39,523 --> 01:07:41,022
     - What are you doing?      

904
01:07:41,024 --> 01:07:42,490
   - I'm calling the police.    

905
01:07:42,492 --> 01:07:43,658
     - Put your phone away.     

906
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:44,726
             - Why?             

907
01:07:44,728 --> 01:07:47,262
      - There is a strong       
      evil in this place,       

908
01:07:47,264 --> 01:07:48,596
      and we won't expose       
   anyone else until we know    

909
01:07:48,598 --> 01:07:50,598
     what we're doing with.     

910
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:53,435
     - Readings have spiked     
       across the board.        

911
01:07:53,437 --> 01:07:56,538
           (groaning)           
          (screaming)           

912
01:07:56,540 --> 01:07:57,672
        Father help me!         

913
01:07:59,376 --> 01:08:00,241
             Faith!             

914
01:08:01,278 --> 01:08:02,143
            - Away!             

915
01:08:03,713 --> 01:08:06,548
  (speaking foreign language)   

916
01:08:06,550 --> 01:08:07,649
             Away!              

917
01:08:10,687 --> 01:08:12,253
      - Leave this place.       

918
01:08:15,459 --> 01:08:16,391
            - Sarah?            

919
01:08:16,393 --> 01:08:18,626
  - Stay right there Richard.   

920
01:08:20,130 --> 01:08:22,263
       Who are you demon?       

921
01:08:22,265 --> 01:08:24,632
I command you to name yourself. 

922
01:08:24,634 --> 01:08:27,035
      - It asks questions.      

923
01:08:27,037 --> 01:08:31,639
     Stupid questions as it     
  knows my name, it fears me.   

924
01:08:31,641 --> 01:08:33,308
 - I've faced your kind before. 

925
01:08:33,310 --> 01:08:35,710
       - Faced the small.       

926
01:08:35,712 --> 01:08:37,445
     The weak, but not me.      

927
01:08:38,148 --> 01:08:40,648
           (groaning)           

928
01:08:40,650 --> 01:08:43,318
        (ominous music)         

929
01:08:56,566 --> 01:08:59,567
       - You didn't know        
       she was pregnant?        

930
01:08:59,569 --> 01:09:02,470
        - That's because        
     yesterday she wasn't.      

931
01:09:02,472 --> 01:09:04,038
      - Who's the father?       

932
01:09:08,178 --> 01:09:09,577
      - It's not possible.      

933
01:09:09,579 --> 01:09:11,679
     - What's not possible?     

934
01:09:14,017 --> 01:09:15,583
       - Last night I...        

935
01:09:17,754 --> 01:09:20,655
        I (mumbling)...         

936
01:09:26,596 --> 01:09:28,696
  There was this woman and...   

937
01:09:33,270 --> 01:09:35,236
    And I had sex with her.     

938
01:09:40,644 --> 01:09:42,677
     And I finished and...      

939
01:09:47,317 --> 01:09:49,584
   I saw her, I saw her face.   

940
01:09:56,026 --> 01:09:58,393
  It was Sarah, it was Sarah!   

941
01:09:59,362 --> 01:10:01,696
           (weeping)            

942
01:10:09,839 --> 01:10:11,539
       What do we do now?       

943
01:10:15,845 --> 01:10:18,213
  Maybe we should pray again.   

944
01:10:19,249 --> 01:10:22,183
           (laughing)           

945
01:10:22,185 --> 01:10:25,053
      - I've helped a lot       
       of people Richard.       

946
01:10:25,055 --> 01:10:26,988
    But they all had faith.     

947
01:10:28,158 --> 01:10:30,058
     And as hard as it is,      
      now is not the time       

948
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:32,360
      to be losing yours.       

949
01:10:32,362 --> 01:10:35,330
  - Well I never really had it  
much in abundance to begin with 

950
01:10:35,332 --> 01:10:37,865
        so that presents        
     somewhat of a problem.     

951
01:10:37,867 --> 01:10:39,767
      - Then find it, and       
     be quick about it too      

952
01:10:39,769 --> 01:10:41,836
    if you wanna help Sarah.    

953
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:45,573
          - Help her?           

954
01:10:45,575 --> 01:10:46,441
             - Yes.             

955
01:10:47,510 --> 01:10:48,643
         - She's sick.          

956
01:10:50,714 --> 01:10:52,347
      She, she seduced me.      

957
01:10:55,518 --> 01:10:57,819
 She murdered that poor woman.  

958
01:10:59,889 --> 01:11:01,456
    And God knows what else.    

959
01:11:01,458 --> 01:11:03,124
     - Whatever's happening     
   here, you can be sure it's   

960
01:11:03,126 --> 01:11:05,526
    not your sister's doing.    

961
01:11:05,528 --> 01:11:09,864
    She's under the control     
   of a very powerful demon.    

962
01:11:09,866 --> 01:11:12,300
 And you need to remember this. 

963
01:11:13,203 --> 01:11:14,869
          Understand?           

964
01:11:14,871 --> 01:11:16,371
      - Whatever you say.       

965
01:11:39,396 --> 01:11:40,962
          - Dear God.           

966
01:11:40,964 --> 01:11:45,233
    (ghostly voice speaking     
      in foreign language)      

967
01:11:53,009 --> 01:11:54,909
      She's coming around.      

968
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:14,429
    (ghostly voice speaking     
      in foreign language)      

969
01:12:21,104 --> 01:12:22,804
     - It will release me!      

970
01:12:22,806 --> 01:12:25,306
    - Our Father who art in     
 heaven, hallowed be thy name.  

971
01:12:25,308 --> 01:12:29,777
    (ghostly voice speaking     
      in foreign language)      

972
01:12:29,779 --> 01:12:32,914
       - Mother who kills       
      her own is now mine.      

973
01:12:34,317 --> 01:12:37,452
        The little one,         
     sick, weak, pathetic.      

974
01:12:39,889 --> 01:12:44,125
      We took her soul and      
     now we take this one.      

975
01:12:44,127 --> 01:12:45,626
          - Elizabeth.          

976
01:12:45,628 --> 01:12:48,830
 - Don't listen to it, telling  
     lies is in its nature.     

977
01:12:48,832 --> 01:12:52,900
   - Yes, but this one knows    
     he does not hear lies.     

978
01:12:55,004 --> 01:12:58,072
       He knows this time       
      we speak the truth.       

979
01:12:59,542 --> 01:13:01,642
    - You killed Elizabeth.     

980
01:13:01,644 --> 01:13:04,178
  (speaking foreign language)   

981
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:06,481
       - I denounce you.        

982
01:13:06,483 --> 01:13:08,583
           (laughing)           

983
01:13:08,585 --> 01:13:12,420
   - Does this one think his    
 little tricks will work on us? 

984
01:13:12,422 --> 01:13:14,222
     - Your name is Belial.     

985
01:13:14,224 --> 01:13:15,556
           (groaning)           

986
01:13:15,558 --> 01:13:17,892
      You are a servant of      
      the father of lies.       

987
01:13:17,894 --> 01:13:20,895
       I know you demon,        
       and I rebuke you.        

988
01:13:21,998 --> 01:13:25,900
    (ghostly voice speaking     
      in foreign language)      

989
01:13:31,508 --> 01:13:34,108
 Our Father, who art in heaven. 

990
01:13:34,110 --> 01:13:36,778
      - What grows inside       
        is far stronger         

991
01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:39,947
      than little man and       
        his pitiful God.        

992
01:13:39,949 --> 01:13:41,015
      - Thy kingdom come--      

993
01:13:41,017 --> 01:13:44,085
          (screaming)           

994
01:13:44,087 --> 01:13:46,020
    - Deny us? Weak mortal!     

995
01:13:49,692 --> 01:13:52,026
           (groaning)           

996
01:13:55,965 --> 01:13:58,466
          (sad music)           

997
01:14:08,878 --> 01:14:09,710
             - Hey.             

998
01:14:25,161 --> 01:14:27,328
   - Whatever that thing is.    

999
01:14:33,436 --> 01:14:35,069
      It's right isn't it?      

1000
01:14:36,105 --> 01:14:37,905
         - How's that?          

1001
01:14:37,907 --> 01:14:42,143
       - You never faced        
    anything like it before.    

1002
01:14:42,145 --> 01:14:43,010
           Have you?            

1003
01:14:46,449 --> 01:14:47,315
             - No.              

1004
01:14:52,155 --> 01:14:54,755
- So how are you gonna stop it? 

1005
01:14:54,757 --> 01:14:57,859
 - Only God is perfect Richard. 

1006
01:14:57,861 --> 01:14:59,427
    And every other creature    
   in this world and the next   

1007
01:14:59,429 --> 01:15:00,595
         is imperfect.          

1008
01:15:02,499 --> 01:15:06,000
    And everything imperfect    
        has a weakness.         

1009
01:15:07,136 --> 01:15:11,105
      All we need to do is      
    figure out what that is.    

1010
01:15:16,613 --> 01:15:20,848
     - Well, it's about as      
    good as we're gonna do.     

1011
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:22,283
      - Is she still out?       

1012
01:15:22,285 --> 01:15:24,685
   - She should be, I pumped    
     with her enough juice      

1013
01:15:24,687 --> 01:15:27,355
to put down a herd of elephants.

1014
01:15:31,861 --> 01:15:35,162
       Can I talk to you        
      alone for a moment?       

1015
01:15:35,164 --> 01:15:36,030
            - Yeah.             

1016
01:15:46,142 --> 01:15:47,074
          What is it?           

1017
01:15:49,312 --> 01:15:51,112
      - I'm outta tranqs.       

1018
01:15:52,348 --> 01:15:56,117
 So I don't know what the plan  
  is when she wakes up again.   

1019
01:15:57,554 --> 01:15:59,186
    I really feel like this     
  time we bit off more than we  

1020
01:15:59,188 --> 01:16:03,658
      can handle, and then      
       her condition only       
      complicates things.       

1021
01:16:03,660 --> 01:16:05,860
     - Now which condition      
         would that be?         

1022
01:16:05,862 --> 01:16:08,596
      The fact that she's       
     possessed or pregnant.     

1023
01:16:08,598 --> 01:16:10,531
   - If what Richard told you   
    is true than this thing     

1024
01:16:10,533 --> 01:16:12,700
       inside her is less       
        than a day old.         

1025
01:16:12,702 --> 01:16:15,102
 - And that would be a miracle. 

1026
01:16:15,104 --> 01:16:19,106
      - A miracle, that we      
    can not allow to happen.    

1027
01:16:19,108 --> 01:16:20,041
     - What are you saying?     

1028
01:16:20,043 --> 01:16:23,411
- I'm saying we need to stop it.

1029
01:16:23,413 --> 01:16:26,080
- By saying stop, you mean kill?

1030
01:16:28,751 --> 01:16:30,051
             - Yes.             

1031
01:16:30,053 --> 01:16:33,521
     - If you kill her, you     
     kill an unborn child.      

1032
01:16:33,523 --> 01:16:34,655
         - We need to.          

1033
01:16:36,759 --> 01:16:39,927
      - I don't wanna hear      
        anymore of this.        

1034
01:16:48,104 --> 01:16:48,970
           - Richard.           

1035
01:17:09,892 --> 01:17:12,393
Richard don't let them hurt me. 

1036
01:17:12,395 --> 01:17:13,761
  - They're here to help you.   

1037
01:17:13,763 --> 01:17:16,297
- No, they're going to kill me. 

1038
01:17:17,233 --> 01:17:18,332
             - No!              

1039
01:17:19,602 --> 01:17:22,103
    - Richard, are you okay?    

1040
01:17:22,105 --> 01:17:23,237
          - Stay away.          

1041
01:17:23,239 --> 01:17:24,505
   - I'm trying to help you.    

1042
01:17:24,507 --> 01:17:26,641
        - No you're not.        

1043
01:17:26,643 --> 01:17:28,909
    No, you wanna kill her.     

1044
01:17:28,911 --> 01:17:30,244
        - Hey, Richard.         

1045
01:17:30,246 --> 01:17:31,746
      - Fuck you get out!       

1046
01:17:32,815 --> 01:17:35,349
         - Richard I'm          
      trying to help her.       

1047
01:17:35,351 --> 01:17:38,019
      - Yeah, but now that      
     you realize you can't,     

1048
01:17:38,021 --> 01:17:40,021
     you're gonna kill her,     
    she can read your mind,     

1049
01:17:40,023 --> 01:17:42,289
     she talks to me, she's     
    begging me to stop you.     

1050
01:17:42,291 --> 01:17:46,093
    - Richard, you know this    
creature can take on many forms.

1051
01:17:46,095 --> 01:17:48,863
  And if you're hearing Sarah   
now, you must know it's a demon 

1052
01:17:48,865 --> 01:17:52,533
     trying to deceive you,     
     you have to trust me.      

1053
01:17:53,436 --> 01:17:55,603
   Come here, I'll show you.    

1054
01:18:05,014 --> 01:18:07,381
           (laughing)           

1055
01:18:11,154 --> 01:18:13,621
  Go ahead, ask it a question.  

1056
01:18:15,324 --> 01:18:17,625
Something only Sarah would know.

1057
01:18:17,627 --> 01:18:20,795
      Believe me it won't       
     be able to answer it.      

1058
01:18:20,797 --> 01:18:22,196
       - [Richard] Sarah?       

1059
01:18:22,198 --> 01:18:26,133
   - The little man tells the   
   truth, she is gone, gone!    

1060
01:18:26,135 --> 01:18:30,237
    - Away with you, servant    
    of lies, child of evil!     

1061
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:32,039
  God's word holds the power!   

1062
01:18:32,041 --> 01:18:34,475
- Does it want to see my power? 

1063
01:18:34,477 --> 01:18:35,376
           (groaning)           

1064
01:18:35,378 --> 01:18:37,211
         - God, Sarah.          

1065
01:18:37,213 --> 01:18:41,482
          (screaming)           
        (hallowed music)        

1066
01:18:43,252 --> 01:18:45,152
       - I cast you out!        

1067
01:18:45,154 --> 01:18:47,321
           (growling)           
   I believe in the true God,   

1068
01:18:47,323 --> 01:18:49,523
  creator of heaven and earth!  

1069
01:18:49,525 --> 01:18:50,891
        I cast you out!         

1070
01:18:53,029 --> 01:18:55,429
  For he is the one true God!   

1071
01:18:56,833 --> 01:18:59,266
         We (mumbling).         
          (screaming)           

1072
01:18:59,268 --> 01:19:00,634
        I cast you out!         

1073
01:19:01,738 --> 01:19:04,972
       I cast you out in        
     the name of the Lord!      

1074
01:19:06,209 --> 01:19:08,709
  - Oh my God it's happening!   

1075
01:19:08,711 --> 01:19:10,277
      - In the name of...       

1076
01:19:16,219 --> 01:19:18,319
  - We need to stop this now.   

1077
01:19:19,222 --> 01:19:24,125
           (groaning)           
         (baby crying)          

1078
01:19:24,127 --> 01:19:26,293
           (rumbling)           

1079
01:19:29,599 --> 01:19:31,632
    (ghostly voice speaking     
      in foreign language)      

1080
01:19:31,634 --> 01:19:34,268
- [Sarah] You shall not stop us!

1081
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:37,271
        - Richard, open         
       the door Richard!        

1082
01:19:39,742 --> 01:19:42,143
           (rumbling)           

1083
01:19:45,381 --> 01:19:48,215
      - The whole place is      
     coming down around us!     

1084
01:19:48,217 --> 01:19:52,486
           (rumbling)           
        (hallowed music)        

1085
01:20:16,946 --> 01:20:19,313
 - Okay father just to clarify  
    you're not under arrest,    

1086
01:20:19,315 --> 01:20:22,650
      so you can stop this      
     interview at any time.     

1087
01:20:22,652 --> 01:20:24,518
    And you've been advised     
    that you have the right     

1088
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:27,121
   to an attorney, so if you    
     continue talking to me     

1089
01:20:27,123 --> 01:20:30,491
      anything you say can      
      be used against you.      

1090
01:20:34,430 --> 01:20:37,498
        Father, are you         
      willing to continue?      

1091
01:20:41,671 --> 01:20:42,536
             Okay.              

1092
01:20:44,207 --> 01:20:47,274
      You want me to call       
        the archdiocese?        

1093
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:53,614
     - So, let's go through     
      this one more time.       

1094
01:20:53,616 --> 01:20:56,350
    - There's nothing Father    
    Frank or I can tell you,    

1095
01:20:56,352 --> 01:20:59,019
   that isn't on that camera.   

1096
01:20:59,021 --> 01:21:00,454
      If you can find it.       

1097
01:21:00,456 --> 01:21:04,325
       - Buried under 40        
     tons of rubble, yeah,      

1098
01:21:04,327 --> 01:21:06,193
 I'm not gonna get my hopes up. 

1099
01:21:06,195 --> 01:21:09,296
   - You need to look at this   
  from my point of view okay.   

1100
01:21:09,298 --> 01:21:12,299
 Now as much as I hate putting  
    the screws to a priest,     

1101
01:21:12,301 --> 01:21:15,603
       there's a lot here       
     that needs explaining.     

1102
01:21:17,974 --> 01:21:19,240
         - I felt them.         

1103
01:21:20,076 --> 01:21:21,442
        - You felt who?         

1104
01:21:23,312 --> 01:21:27,448
    - They say the good will    
    inevitably conquer evil.    

1105
01:21:28,551 --> 01:21:30,885
       This time at least       
         they're wrong.         

1106
01:21:30,887 --> 01:21:35,155
    - Please could we try to    
   be a little less cryptic?    

1107
01:21:38,094 --> 01:21:41,695
        - Do you believe        
       in God, detective?       

1108
01:21:41,697 --> 01:21:42,596
          - Of course.          

1109
01:21:42,598 --> 01:21:44,665
   - How about the evil one?    

1110
01:21:45,735 --> 01:21:48,135
  Well do you believe in him?   

1111
01:21:49,605 --> 01:21:51,939
    - Father what I believe     
      in is what I can see      

1112
01:21:51,941 --> 01:21:54,942
    and what I can smell and    
    what I've got right now,    

1113
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:59,346
    is I've got a collapsed     
 house, and a mutilated corpse, 

1114
01:21:59,348 --> 01:22:03,350
 and that looks and smells real 
  bad for you and your friend.  

1115
01:22:03,352 --> 01:22:06,220
 - Molly Hanning was her name.  

1116
01:22:06,222 --> 01:22:09,356
    Search and Rescue found     
    her body in the rubble.     

1117
01:22:09,358 --> 01:22:12,092
    She was cut up real bad.    

1118
01:22:12,094 --> 01:22:14,662
- What about Richard and Sarah? 

1119
01:22:16,365 --> 01:22:18,032
      What about the baby?      

1120
01:22:18,034 --> 01:22:20,968
     - No we only found the     
    one, the neighbor lady,     

1121
01:22:20,970 --> 01:22:22,536
       the Mrs. Hanning.        

1122
01:22:24,573 --> 01:22:27,141
 - And you didn't find a baby?  

1123
01:22:30,980 --> 01:22:33,480
  For all our sakes detective,  

1124
01:22:34,417 --> 01:22:37,785
    I pray that that was an     
    oversight on your part.     

1125
01:22:37,787 --> 01:22:39,553
      - What do you mean?       

1126
01:22:40,623 --> 01:22:42,423
       - If it survived--       

1127
01:22:42,425 --> 01:22:45,559
      - Survived, what are      
       you talking about?       

1128
01:22:48,230 --> 01:22:50,297
    - If the child was born,    

1129
01:22:51,968 --> 01:22:55,636
    if that monstrosity has     
      entered our world...      

1130
01:23:00,276 --> 01:23:01,508
        God help us all.        

1131
01:23:15,257 --> 01:23:17,157
   - [Man] Just wanted to let   
    you know that the priest    

1132
01:23:17,159 --> 01:23:19,994
       and his friend are       
     gone, for now at least     

1133
01:23:19,996 --> 01:23:24,298
   you'll be safe from them,    
  I'll see you later Richard.   

1134
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:28,302
      Protect your family       
     and protect the child.     

1135
01:23:28,304 --> 01:23:30,771
     Many will come to hurt     
     him, but you and Sarah     

1136
01:23:30,773 --> 01:23:35,009
     are strong and that's      
      why you were chosen.      

1137
01:23:35,011 --> 01:23:37,945
       (foreboding music)       

1138
01:23:48,057 --> 01:23:52,026
 (moves into calming sad music) 

1139
01:24:06,242 --> 01:24:09,643
     (sad foreboding music)     

1140
01:24:57,927 --> 01:25:00,928
      (sad ominous music)
