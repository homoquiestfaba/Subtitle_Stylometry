a man that I can trust,

364
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:10,496
then we can do business.

365
00:17:10,531 --> 00:17:14,199

just business, right?

and his watch cost more

367

than my whole bottom
line for a month,

368
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:24,143

if I can trust him.

on paper, summarized

374
00:17:38,025 --> 00:17:40,859
and then we see if we
can do some business.

375
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:43,762
All right?

376
00:17:43,797 --> 00:17:44,897
Oh, I'm sorry.

377
00:17:44,932 --> 00:17:46,932

381
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:55,574
[FLACO] What up, man?

382
00:17:55,609 --> 00:17:56,875
Hey, I'm so proud of your boy.

383
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,210
You should have seen him today.

384
00:17:58,245 --> 00:18:00,079
I think he made his
first sale day one.

385
00:18:00,114 --> 00:18:01,513
Hmm.

386

Maybe you should try
that sometime.

391

Hey, yo come on Ant, let's go
work on this summary, man.

393
00:18:18,732 --> 00:18:21,734
Show you how to get
this paperwork down.

397
00:18:28,909 --> 00:18:31,176

We'll go in a minute.

Deal me in this time.

400
00:18:54,701 --> 00:18:58,237
[ANT] Flaco was excited
to have me working for him.

401
00:18:59,873 --> 00:19:02,641
Too excited.

402
00:19:02,676 --> 00:19:07,079
But hey, I didn't have
anything else to do.

403
00:19:07,114 --> 00:19:09,515
So I kept working.

404
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:12,017
Most sales pitches
went the same way.

405
00:19:12,052 --> 00:19:15,654
We asked if they are happy
with their service, tell 'em

406
00:19:15,689 --> 00:19:19,892
we can beat their rates and
offer to draw up a summary.

407
00:19:19,927 --> 00:19:23,028
But the one thing I couldn't
understand is these businesses

408
00:19:23,063 --> 00:19:26,632
would give us their statements
to draw up the summary and they

409
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:28,567
had every credit
card transaction

410
00:19:28,602 --> 00:19:31,236
that the business
did that month.

411
00:19:31,271 --> 00:19:35,140
Every credit card name,
every credit card number.

412
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:38,577
And all that money, before it
went to vendors or MasterCard

413
00:19:38,612 --> 00:19:43,749
or Visa or whatever, it went
through Flaco's bank.

00:34:55,528 --> 00:34:58,029
and the clients
don't know a thing.

712
00:34:58,064 --> 00:34:59,797
Pennies.

713
00:34:59,832 --> 00:35:02,967
Now you, you got access
to central banking records

714
00:35:03,002 --> 00:35:06,170
and credit card accounts
for several of your clients

715
00:35:06,205 --> 00:35:08,473
and your company?

716
00:35:08,508 --> 00:35:12,744
They got access to thousands
more and all we want?

717
00:35:14,814 --> 00:35:17,715
Pennies.

718
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:20,685
Wait, hold on, Ant.

719
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,755
Are you asking me to rob
my processing bank?

720
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:26,023
Yes.

721
00:35:26,058 --> 00:35:29,961
[ANT] Millions of times a week.

722
00:35:29,996 --> 00:35:32,263
Wow.

723
00:35:32,298 --> 00:35:35,299
Look, I don't... Ant,
I don't know, man.

724
00:35:35,334 --> 00:35:38,069
I don't even have access to
those accounts like that,

725
00:35:38,104 --> 00:35:39,504
except when I'm at work.

726
00:35:39,539 --> 00:35:42,874
And even then, all the
computers are monitored.

727
00:35:42,909 --> 00:35:44,142
But then you got the clients

728
00:35:44,177 --> 00:35:46,778
and the customers and the bank.

729
00:35:46,813 --> 00:35:50,047
They might notice that, man.

730
00:35:50,082 --> 00:35:53,317
If they do, yo, man,
that shit is crazy, man.

731
00:35:53,352 --> 00:35:55,820
I don't even know how to do it.

732
00:35:55,855 --> 00:35:57,522
Me neither.

733
00:35:57,557 --> 00:36:00,791
But if you hungry, you
gonna find food, right?

734
00:36:03,863 --> 00:36:05,830
I can't, man.

735
00:36:07,667 --> 00:36:10,802
Oh well, thank you
for your hospitality

736
00:36:10,837 --> 00:36:12,136
and we'll be in touch.

737
00:36:12,171 --> 00:36:14,105
All right?

738
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:16,407
Come on, son.

739
00:36:21,948 --> 00:36:23,948
Yo, what the fuck was that?

740
00:36:23,983 --> 00:36:25,349
Business, nigga.

741
00:36:25,384 --> 00:36:27,752
- That's my cousin, nigga.
- And?

742
00:36:27,787 --> 00:36:30,555
He want in whether he
realize it or not.

743
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:32,356
Yo, we been through
the fire and you know

744
00:36:32,391 --> 00:36:34,759
I'll follow you
wherever, my nigga.

745
00:36:34,794 --> 00:36:36,360
But that nigga?

746
00:36:36,395 --> 00:36:37,662
You scared the shit
out of him, man.

747
00:36:37,697 --> 00:36:39,363
He ain't ready for all that.

748
00:36:39,398 --> 00:36:41,999
But you are though, right?

749
00:36:42,034 --> 00:36:44,869
And I am.

750
00:36:44,904 --> 00:36:46,738
So something gotta give, nigga.

751
00:36:49,909 --> 00:36:50,975
Fuck it.

752
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:52,744
Let's go get an apartment.

753
00:36:55,314 --> 00:36:56,848
Not bad, not bad.

754
00:36:56,883 --> 00:36:59,283
This'll work.

755
00:36:59,318 --> 00:37:01,553
Nice little view.

756
00:37:05,858 --> 00:37:07,859
What the fuck?

757
00:37:09,762 --> 00:37:11,829
Door was open, man,
just delivering the order.

758
00:37:11,864 --> 00:37:15,132
[PHONE RINGING]

759
00:37:15,167 --> 00:37:16,767
Who this?

760
00:37:16,802 --> 00:37:20,305
So is that flat screen
gonna be big enough for you?

761
00:37:23,342 --> 00:37:25,743
Listen, why don't you
and Carter come downstairs?

762
00:37:25,778 --> 00:37:28,813
I have somebody
I want you to meet.

763
00:37:28,848 --> 00:37:30,915

766
00:37:40,192 --> 00:37:41,826
What the fuck was that?

767
00:37:41,861 --> 00:37:44,162
What's up, what's up.

768
00:37:47,033 --> 00:37:49,334
How you knew we was here?

769
00:37:52,738 --> 00:37:56,040
Ya'll know where we
get our money from?

770
00:37:56,075 --> 00:37:57,341
Don't matter.

771
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:59,176
Don't ask, don't tell, right?

772
00:37:59,211 --> 00:38:01,613
- You are funny.
- It's Tyson's.

773
00:38:03,683 --> 00:38:07,018
Yo, who the fuck is Tyson?

774
00:38:07,053 --> 00:38:08,352
Relax.

775
00:38:08,387 --> 00:38:11,389
It ain't like that.

776
00:38:11,424 --> 00:38:13,190
You fucking Tyson too?

777
00:38:13,225 --> 00:38:15,092
Are you serious?

778
00:38:15,127 --> 00:38:17,194
No, I'm not fucking Tyson.

779
00:38:17,229 --> 00:38:18,362
You know I'm a greedy
motherfucker.

780
00:38:18,397 --> 00:38:21,299
I don't like sharing.

781
00:38:21,334 --> 00:38:23,367
I do now.

782
00:38:23,402 --> 00:38:25,469
- This is our car.
- Uh-huh.

783
00:38:25,504 --> 00:38:27,371
I'm really gonna need
you to trust me.

784
00:38:27,406 --> 00:38:30,041
We're gonna take you
on a special trip.

785
00:38:30,076 --> 00:38:32,043
Where we going?

786
00:38:32,078 --> 00:38:34,011
For a ride.

787
00:38:34,046 --> 00:38:36,414
- I ain't getting in the car.
- Get in the car!

788
00:38:36,449 --> 00:38:38,215
How about I drive?

789
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:41,252
I'll follow you.

790
00:38:41,287 --> 00:38:43,955
From the backseat.

791
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:47,458

him you want to go.

792

Damn.

801
00:39:17,056 --> 00:39:20,959
Jackie, thank you.

802
00:39:25,031 --> 00:39:27,465
You must be Carter.

803
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,500
Wait a minute, are you Tyson?

804
00:39:29,535 --> 00:39:33,804
Jackie, maybe you'd like
to show Carter the pool.

805
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,806
Oh, I didn't mean no disrespect.

806
00:39:35,841 --> 00:39:38,676
I thought Tyson was a nigga.

809
00:39:52,058 --> 00:39:54,458
There's no Tyson.

810
00:39:54,493 --> 00:39:55,860
Is there?

811
00:39:55,895 --> 00:39:57,428
Oh, there's thousands of them,

812
00:39:57,463 --> 00:40:00,097
small and hard and with
a flick of a wrist,

813
00:40:00,132 --> 00:40:02,867
they bring me money faster
than I ever thought possible.

814
00:40:02,902 --> 00:40:07,071
And they can do the same
for you, don't you know?

815
00:40:07,106 --> 00:40:09,373
So you been watching me.

816
00:40:09,408 --> 00:40:12,009
No, not at first.

817
00:40:12,044 --> 00:40:16,347
I watch your cousin because
sometimes I watch people

818
00:40:16,382 --> 00:40:21,519
I think maybe I can use,
but Flaco is weak.

819
00:40:21,554 --> 00:40:25,589
Weak mind and weak will.

820
00:40:25,624 --> 00:40:28,793
But then I hear somebody
new come to town

821
00:40:28,828 --> 00:40:31,062
and I start to watch you.

822
00:40:31,097 --> 00:40:33,030
And you are strong.

823
00:40:33,065 --> 00:40:35,566
Mmm.

824
00:40:35,601 --> 00:40:38,035
So you sent Cassandra after me.

825
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:39,503
No.

826
00:40:39,538 --> 00:40:42,206
No, Cassie is a big girl.

827
00:40:42,241 --> 00:40:43,541
I don't send her after you.

828
00:40:43,576 --> 00:40:47,545
She's strong herself.

829
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:50,414
Anyway, she think we
have similar interests.

830
00:40:50,449 --> 00:40:52,416
Like what?

831
00:40:52,451 --> 00:40:55,352
She says you're a hungry
man, like a lion.

832
00:40:55,387 --> 00:40:57,021
I like a man with appetite.

833
00:40:57,056 --> 00:40:58,222
What?

834
00:40:58,257 --> 00:40:59,757
Maybe you don't understand me.

835
00:40:59,792 --> 00:41:02,893
My father is Jamaican and
my mother's from Minnesota

836
00:41:02,928 --> 00:41:05,529
and I was raised in the South.

837
00:41:05,564 --> 00:41:08,532
So everybody say I talk
like a Muppet, you know?

838
00:41:08,567 --> 00:41:12,136
But I want you to
come work for me.

839
00:41:12,171 --> 00:41:13,370
Well uh...

840
00:41:13,405 --> 00:41:15,473
Call me Mama Cash.

841
00:41:15,508 --> 00:41:17,541
I really appreciate the offer.

842
00:41:17,576 --> 00:41:20,044
Call me Mama Cash.

843
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:21,445
I work for myself.

844
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,881
Look, motherfucker,
you call me Mama Cash.

845
00:41:23,916 --> 00:41:27,151
You're in my goddamn house,
you call me by my goddamn name.

846
00:41:27,186 --> 00:41:29,487
Mama Cash!

847
00:41:29,522 --> 00:41:33,190
Mama Cash!

848
00:41:33,225 --> 00:41:35,059
Mama Cash!

849
00:41:37,296 --> 00:41:38,596
Mama Cash!

850
00:41:38,631 --> 00:41:41,766
Everything all right, Mama?

851
00:41:43,135 --> 00:41:45,136
Yes, baby.

852
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:54,111
I wanted a cowboy.

853
00:41:54,146 --> 00:41:59,583
And so I find him and I bring
him here and I show him a world

854
00:41:59,618 --> 00:42:01,452
he didn't even know could
be real, you know,

855
00:42:01,487 --> 00:42:03,387
and he does everything I say.

856
00:42:03,422 --> 00:42:06,590
Not because he's scared of me
or because I pay him extra,

857
00:42:06,625 --> 00:42:10,227
but because he loves me.

858
00:42:10,262 --> 00:42:15,900
You know, true love,
gratitude and trust.

859
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:18,936
You know, that is power.

860
00:42:18,971 --> 00:42:22,239
I want you to love me too.

861
00:42:22,274 --> 00:42:24,074
I can show you what
Tysons can do for you.

862
00:42:24,109 --> 00:42:26,944
I can show you what
we can do together.

863
00:42:26,979 --> 00:42:30,314
I provide you with equipment
and Flaco will give us the bank

864
00:42:30,349 --> 00:42:34,018
accounts and you provide me with
an operation that make us money

865
00:42:34,053 --> 00:42:36,120
faster than you ever
thought possible.

866
00:42:36,155 --> 00:42:38,455
Look, Flaco ain't going
for that, man.

867
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:41,025
Even if I agreed, he's scared.

868
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:45,196
Let Mama take care
of Flaco's fears.

869
00:42:45,231 --> 00:42:47,131
What do you say?

870
00:42:57,176 --> 00:42:59,644
Uh uh uh.

871
00:43:05,217 --> 00:43:06,317
Here you are.

872
00:43:06,352 --> 00:43:08,018
Good look.

873
00:43:08,053 --> 00:43:11,189
- And...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

874
00:43:16,262 --> 00:43:19,396
Ah.

875
00:43:19,431 --> 00:43:21,332
[CARTER] Well?

876
00:43:21,367 --> 00:43:23,334
Well what?

877
00:43:23,369 --> 00:43:27,571
You tell me what happened
about last night or what?

878
00:43:27,606 --> 00:43:29,073
We been putting in work
all these years

879
00:43:29,108 --> 00:43:31,575
and you ain't never kept
me in the dark never.

880
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:33,377
I'm down for whatever.

881
00:43:33,412 --> 00:43:35,145
I ain't mad.

882
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:39,149
Jackie worked a nigga
pretty good in that hot tub.

883
00:43:39,184 --> 00:43:41,619
But we didn't go out there
for me to get my rocks off.

884
00:43:41,654 --> 00:43:43,287
We partners, right?

885
00:43:43,322 --> 00:43:45,589
What's the deal?

886
00:43:45,624 --> 00:43:46,991
I don't know.

887
00:43:47,026 --> 00:43:51,729
She was talking about Minnesota,

888
00:43:51,764 --> 00:43:57,301
Jamaica and Muppets.

889
00:43:57,336 --> 00:43:59,536
True love and shit.

890
00:43:59,571 --> 00:44:01,005
True love?
