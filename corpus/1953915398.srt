1
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:45,622
EYL, SOMALIA.

2
00:04:11,682 --> 00:04:13,663
They're here.

3
00:04:14,411 --> 00:04:16,105
Hurry, Muse!

4
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,857
Come quickly!

5
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:19,795
Quickly!

6
00:04:35,031 --> 00:04:38,010
What the hell are you doing?
Why aren't you out on the water?

7
00:04:38,147 --> 00:04:40,780
You know what you're supposed to do.

8
00:04:42,873 --> 00:04:46,310
You should be out there earning money.

9
00:04:46,507 --> 00:04:49,291
But we caught a ship last week.

10
00:04:49,365 --> 00:04:54,049
That was last week!
The boss wants money today!

11
00:04:54,139 --> 00:04:58,074
Bring Garaad another ship soon...
or you will answer for it.

12
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:01,611
Everybody, get back to work now!

13
00:05:11,552 --> 00:05:13,809
Stay out of my way today.

14
00:05:16,622 --> 00:05:18,022
Hufan!

15
00:05:18,146 --> 00:05:19,188
Hufan!

16
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:22,048
I'm going to get us something big!

17
00:05:23,074 --> 00:05:26,333
Those who want to make money, come.

18
00:05:26,853 --> 00:05:29,220
Muse, take me with you.

19
00:05:29,853 --> 00:05:31,725
Does your sister know you're here?

20
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,820
She's selling khat up there.

21
00:05:34,328 --> 00:05:37,255
This is her best stuff.

22
00:05:45,171 --> 00:05:48,520
When we get a big ship, you will be well paid.

23
00:05:48,635 --> 00:05:50,031
You want to work?

24
00:05:50,343 --> 00:05:52,327
Do you know how to steer a boat?

25
00:05:52,567 --> 00:05:54,082
Go! Go!

26
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,325
I'm ready.

27
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:58,330
- What do you have for me?
- Money.

28
00:05:58,408 --> 00:06:01,320
- When are you gonna give it to me?
- As soon as we're paid.

29
00:06:02,205 --> 00:06:04,139
Spread out!

30
00:06:06,086 --> 00:06:09,069
Let my man choose his crew.

31
00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:13,820
Next time bring me something if you want to work.

32
00:06:26,398 --> 00:06:27,757
Come on, Bilal.

33
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,628
Hey, skinny...

34
00:06:31,702 --> 00:06:33,753
I can steer your boat.

35
00:06:33,825 --> 00:06:35,950
If you choose me, you won't regret it.

36
00:06:39,021 --> 00:06:40,650
Okay, Elmi.

37
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:45,810
I need somebody strong.

38
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,963
Somebody like this?

39
00:07:00,467 --> 00:07:02,056
I want him.

40
00:07:02,584 --> 00:07:04,710
Get out of my way.

41
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:10,250
Why did he pick him?

42
00:07:10,327 --> 00:07:12,765
He's from another village!

43
00:08:02,374 --> 00:08:03,613
Move!

44
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:06,525
Faster, move faster!

45
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:18,943
See if you can get more power.

46
00:08:19,935 --> 00:08:21,385
Okay.

47
00:08:21,412 --> 00:08:22,771
You! You!

48
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:26,365
Get over here!

49
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:28,550
Come help us!

50
00:15:21,401 --> 00:15:23,655
Their main route is packed with ships...

51
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,882
...but we can't attack a herd.

52
00:15:34,091 --> 00:15:37,220
There is one ship alone.

53
00:21:48,618 --> 00:21:52,079
She's really big!  Get ready!

54
00:21:51,151 --> 00:21:55,020
You worry about yourself Sendirim, you skinny rat!

55
00:22:34,216 --> 00:22:38,275
Brothers, we're going to make a lot of money!

56
00:22:38,594 --> 00:22:41,082
Slow down, the waves are too big!

57
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,720
Did you hear that?  Did you hear that?

58
00:24:12,885 --> 00:24:15,571
We've got to get out of here!

59
00:24:15,615 --> 00:24:18,650
Turn back, turn back!

60
00:24:19,674 --> 00:24:22,875
What are you doing?

61
00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:26,750
Where are you going?

62
00:24:27,976 --> 00:24:30,340
Come on! Keep going!

63
00:25:03,876 --> 00:25:06,571
Faster, faster!

64
00:25:20,241 --> 00:25:22,921
Hurry, hurry!  Go!

65
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:27,317
We're pushing this engine too hard!

66
00:25:42,899 --> 00:25:45,131
Faster, faster!

67
00:26:02,283 --> 00:26:04,824
What happened?

68
00:26:08,222 --> 00:26:10,522
Get back after them!

69
00:26:10,682 --> 00:26:13,620
Restart the engine! Now!
After them! Go!

70
00:26:13,725 --> 00:26:15,233
You cannot push the engine!

71
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:18,074
- Come on!  Let's go!
- It's dead!

72
00:29:17,283 --> 00:29:24,552
<i>  "Hi honey...
working hard, new crew to get in shape." </ I></i>

73
00:29:33,556 --> 00:29:37,189
<i> "I'll call when we get to port." </ I></i>

74
00:29:38,108 --> 00:29:40,010
<i> "Love you." </ I></i>

75
00:29:40,025 --> 00:29:42,025
<i> "Rich" </ i></i>

76
00:29:52,336 --> 00:29:56,015
The ocean was rough... Really rough.

77
00:29:56,078 --> 00:29:58,203
Huffan, I'm telling you...

78
00:29:58,397 --> 00:30:03,328
Out boat couldn't take it...
Nothing was working for us.

79
00:30:03,656 --> 00:30:05,385
Hurry up.

80
00:30:06,438 --> 00:30:09,425
We need a bigger one for that ship.

81
00:30:09,528 --> 00:30:12,052
I want this welded by the morning...

82
00:30:12,125 --> 00:30:14,239
By tomorrow, got it?

83
00:30:17,324 --> 00:30:18,519
Elmi.

84
00:30:18,746 --> 00:30:21,241
When will that engine be ready?

85
00:30:21,533 --> 00:30:23,274
We've gotta fix it.

86
00:30:23,486 --> 00:30:25,330
This thing is old and weak.

87
00:30:26,436 --> 00:30:28,352
It's a piece of shit.

88
00:30:28,633 --> 00:30:31,029
Shut up and fix it!

89
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:33,158
for your crew of women.

90
00:30:38,516 --> 00:30:40,906
Why don't you give me your engine?

91
00:30:41,434 --> 00:30:43,215
Shut up, skinny!

92
00:30:43,346 --> 00:30:45,180
You talk too much!

93
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:49,550
I may be skinny, but I'm not a coward.

94
00:30:56,325 --> 00:30:57,810
What did you say?

95
00:30:58,970 --> 00:30:60,610
Say it again!

96
00:31:02,314 --> 00:31:05,005
You think you're somebody?

97
00:31:06,298 --> 00:31:07,870
Say it again!

98
00:31:26,795 --> 00:31:31,299
The coward is the first one in the grave.

99
00:34:01,718 --> 00:34:05,610
We are the Somali coast guard.
This is a routine check.

100
00:34:05,842 --> 00:34:08,451
Stop your ship now!

101
00:34:08,515 --> 00:34:12,658
We are coming aboard.
We're here to help you.

102
00:34:29,903 --> 00:34:32,084
Stop now!

103
00:34:32,191 --> 00:34:36,010
Alabama!  This is your final warning!

104
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:37,826
Stop the ship!

105
00:34:39,211 --> 00:34:42,010
They're not stopping!

106
00:34:42,188 --> 00:34:44,820
Show them who we are, Muse!

107
00:34:47,435 --> 00:34:49,526
Shoot at them!

108
00:35:03,379 --> 00:35:05,082
Turn!

109
00:35:44,072 --> 00:35:46,063
It's clear over there!

110
00:36:01,293 --> 00:36:03,410
Untie the ladder!

111
00:36:35,517 --> 00:36:36,984
Shoot him!

112
00:36:43,945 --> 00:36:45,871
Let's go, Let's go!

113
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,600
Hurry up, Bilal!

114
00:36:48,384 --> 00:36:50,374
Move your ass, kid!

115
00:37:10,202 --> 00:37:12,166
Stop him!

116
00:37:38,198 --> 00:37:40,650
Higher!  Get it higher!

117
00:37:58,469 --> 00:38:00,550
Hook it on!

118
00:38:20,581 --> 00:38:22,449
Get out of my way!

119
00:40:59,955 --> 00:41:04,080
Don't move! Don't move!

120
00:41:18,189 --> 00:41:19,550
Get away!  Get over there!

121
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:21,495
Alright.

122
00:42:08,813 --> 00:42:12,276
From now on this one is called Irish, okay?

123
00:42:58,473 --> 00:43:00,120
Hey, calm down!  Calm down.

124
00:43:43,211 --> 00:43:45,315
Watch this ugly one.

125
00:43:53,852 --> 00:43:55,169
What are you doing?

126
00:43:55,873 --> 00:43:57,210
I'm going to fix it.

127
00:43:58,404 --> 00:43:59,750
Do you know how?

128
00:43:59,966 --> 00:44:01,235
Hold the gun on him.

129
00:44:01,342 --> 00:44:03,335
I've got him, don't worry.

130
00:44:06,872 --> 00:44:09,188
Don't mess with anything you don't know.

131
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:11,609
Come on, man!

132
00:44:14,655 --> 00:44:19,850
What are you doing?
Just take care of that guy.

133
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:21,657
Stop the games.

134
00:45:05,722 --> 00:45:08,505
Get that one and put him against the wall.

135
00:46:19,754 --> 00:46:22,719
Wait.

136
00:47:05,256 --> 00:47:07,203
Take his radio.

137
00:48:23,838 --> 00:48:24,820
Take his flashlight.

138
00:53:13,403 --> 00:53:15,520
I heard something.

139
00:53:35,852 --> 00:53:37,778
Check the other side.

140
00:53:38,265 --> 00:53:40,755
There's no one here.

141
00:53:40,756 --> 00:53:43,370
Please, let's go back.

142
00:53:43,564 --> 00:53:45,350
I know they were there.

143
00:55:19,964 --> 00:55:21,750
Look man, get us out of here!

144
00:55:43,564 --> 00:55:45,350
Hey, take him upstairs.

145
00:55:46,555 --> 00:55:48,149
I can't move!

146
00:55:48,231 --> 00:55:51,027
Take him upstairs and tell Najee to come!

147
00:58:11,046 --> 00:58:12,435
What happened to you?

148
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:16,575
They put glass down for me...  They got me.

149
00:58:16,643 --> 00:58:18,335
Where is Muse?

150
00:58:18,478 --> 00:58:20,810
In the engine room.

151
00:58:21,267 --> 00:58:24,375
He wants Najee to come down.

152
00:59:01,824 --> 00:59:03,925
Hey! Get me out of here!

153
00:59:05,124 --> 00:59:07,925
<i> Listen to what these guys have to say. </ I></i>

154
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:09,628
What happened?

155
00:59:09,846 --> 00:59:11,964
<i> They cut my hand, bad. </ I></i>

156
00:59:12,066 --> 00:59:16,552
<i> We'll straighten everything out later. </ I></i>
<i> Just get me out of here. </ I></i>

157
00:59:16,670 --> 00:59:18,650
<i> Give Irish the radio. </ I></i>

158
00:59:20,670 --> 00:59:22,650
I'll give it to him now.

159
01:00:01,716 --> 01:00:05,010
Thirty thousand is nothing...

160
01:00:05,011 --> 01:00:07,010
I want millions.

161
01:00:40,522 --> 01:00:44,148
Hey, Bilal, check it out!

162
01:00:44,526 --> 01:00:48,564
If anyone moves, kill them!

163
01:00:48,636 --> 01:00:50,150
Kill them!

164
01:01:27,110 --> 01:01:28,571
What's going on, Skinnny?

165
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:30,571
Do what they say and get me out of here!

166
01:01:31,172 --> 01:01:32,839
Be strong, man.

167
01:02:21,728 --> 01:02:23,850
Watch him!

168
01:02:25,330 --> 01:02:28,550
Bilal, point your gun at him!
Point your gun!

169
01:03:24,575 --> 01:03:25,937
Go!

170
01:03:56,752 --> 01:04:00,210
Irish... It's only us now.

171
01:05:52,252 --> 01:05:56,210
Hufan, do you read me?

172
01:05:59,252 --> 01:06:01,210
Hufan, can you hear me?

173
01:06:02,752 --> 01:06:06,210
Where's your boss?  He should be with us by now.

174
01:06:06,752 --> 01:06:08,210
Don't worry.  He's coming.

175
01:06:13,671 --> 01:06:15,910
Stupid hand.

176
01:06:20,384 --> 01:06:23,450
Stop whining! You sound like a little girl!

177
01:06:23,819 --> 01:06:28,150
You wanted to come with us.  You asked for this.

178
01:06:28,213 --> 01:06:30,450
I didn't think this would happen!

179
01:06:30,858 --> 01:06:33,026
I could lose my foot!

180
01:06:33,225 --> 01:06:36,568
You have to be ready for anyything...

181
01:06:36,569 --> 01:06:39,185
This game isn't for the weak.

182
01:07:29,362 --> 01:07:30,785
What is it?

183
01:07:32,385 --> 01:07:34,285
It's a gift.

184
01:08:36,091 --> 01:08:38,106
Give me some khat.

185
01:08:38,121 --> 01:08:40,871
Why? You've had more than your share.

186
01:08:40,889 --> 01:08:43,119
Says who? Give me some more!

187
01:08:43,162 --> 01:08:44,427
Shut up!

188
01:08:44,466 --> 01:08:46,491
Both of you shut up!

189
01:08:46,496 --> 01:08:48,425
Just take it!

190
01:08:49,859 --> 01:08:51,870
This is it?

191
01:08:52,852 --> 01:08:54,625
That's all I have.

192
01:08:54,891 --> 01:08:56,431
Where is the rest?

193
01:08:56,538 --> 01:08:58,185
I don't have any.

194
01:08:58,256 --> 01:08:59,930
It's all gone.

195
01:08:59,984 --> 01:09:03,202
You are useless.  I should have taken it from you.

196
01:11:56,442 --> 01:11:57,720
What are you doing?

197
01:11:57,847 --> 01:11:59,330
He's got a knife!

198
01:12:03,033 --> 01:12:05,943
Go back... Get back there!

199
01:15:22,443 --> 01:15:24,675
Drive this thing right!

200
01:15:24,914 --> 01:15:26,661
Calm down, we're on the ocean.

201
01:15:26,351 --> 01:15:28,852
I should throw you off this boat right now!

202
01:15:28,925 --> 01:15:31,315
You need to sit down and relax.

203
01:15:43,257 --> 01:15:44,549
That's enough.

204
01:15:45,943 --> 01:15:47,330
Take it away.

205
01:15:48,334 --> 01:15:51,310
From now on this water is only for us!

206
01:15:58,844 --> 01:16:01,625
Stop being such an asshole.

207
01:16:03,823 --> 01:16:06,728
You've got to control him.

208
01:16:06,852 --> 01:16:08,479
Just drive and shut up.

209
01:16:12,224 --> 01:16:14,835
Hufan, can you hear me?

210
01:16:52,364 --> 01:16:53,805
What's wrong with you?

211
01:16:53,903 --> 01:16:55,637
Don't talk to me.

212
01:17:18,587 --> 01:17:21,068
Hufan, can you hear me?

213
01:17:21,483 --> 01:17:24,548
Hufan, can you hear me?

214
01:17:42,367 --> 01:17:44,485
We should be heading northwest...

215
01:17:44,874 --> 01:17:47,939
We've got to get to Garaad's port.

216
01:17:48,527 --> 01:17:50,755
We are, but there's a lot of wind.

217
01:17:51,339 --> 01:17:51,885
Just go!

218
01:17:52,164 --> 01:17:54,850
Okay, then let me do it!

219
01:17:56,646 --> 01:17:59,220
<i> Muse? Are you there? </ I></i>

220
01:17:59,519 --> 01:18:01,423
<i> Are you there? </ I></i>

221
01:18:02,210 --> 01:18:04,389
Hufan... where are you?

222
01:18:04,476 --> 01:18:07,250
<i> I'm having trouble with the engine. </ I></i>

223
01:18:07,522 --> 01:18:11,550
<i>Head home,
I'll be there as soon as I can. </ I></i>

224
01:18:11,621 --> 01:18:13,310
Hey, we're alone out here...

225
01:18:13,420 --> 01:18:15,397
... And we need you to pick us up.

226
01:18:15,468 --> 01:18:17,413
We've got to get out of this lifeboat.

227
01:18:17,536 --> 01:18:20,054
<i> Shut up and listen to me! </ I></i>

228
01:18:20,270 --> 01:18:22,725
<i> You screwed up getting the ship... </ i></i>

229
01:18:22,811 --> 01:18:25,275
<i>... so Garaad says bring back that Captain... </ i></i>

230
01:18:25,391 --> 01:18:27,825
<i>... or don't come back at all. </ i></i>

231
01:19:52,951 --> 01:19:55,130
I need air.

232
01:19:56,536 --> 01:19:59,760
When are we going to be home?

233
01:20:00,310 --> 01:20:03,225
I can't feel my foot anymore.

234
01:20:03,312 --> 01:20:05,676
It's like hell in here.

235
01:21:46,891 --> 01:21:48,875
You think you have any power here?

236
01:21:48,891 --> 01:21:49,875
Let him go!

237
01:21:49,918 --> 01:21:52,925
I should shoot you and be done!

238
01:21:53,051 --> 01:21:54,754
Take your gun off him!

239
01:21:55,168 --> 01:21:57,941
I'm the captain! Who do you think you are?

240
01:21:58,832 --> 01:22:01,132
You're taking his side?

241
01:22:02,258 --> 01:22:04,442
You let the American do whatever he wants!

242
01:22:16,747 --> 01:22:19,165
I'm losing control!

243
01:22:58,971 --> 01:23:00,332
It's the Americans!

244
01:23:00,461 --> 01:23:02,147
Do something to secure the door!

245
01:23:29,545 --> 01:23:31,333
<i> Calm down, brother... </ I></i>

246
01:23:31,333 --> 01:23:34,333
<i> We're here for the Captain, not for you. </ I></i>

247
01:23:34,957 --> 01:23:37,027
They have a spy with them!

248
01:23:39,596 --> 01:23:41,438
Hey... you. Who are you?

249
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:43,905
My name is Nemo...

250
01:23:44,340 --> 01:23:46,862
I work with the U.S. Navy.

251
01:23:47,523 --> 01:23:49,651
<i> We just want to talk. </ I></i>

252
01:23:50,159 --> 01:23:52,050
We speak English.

253
01:23:52,190 --> 01:23:54,850
I want ten million dollars.

254
01:23:54,966 --> 01:23:59,250
It's not that easy, but we'll work on it.

255
01:24:00,097 --> 01:24:03,715
<i> In the meantime, what if I bring you some food and water? </ I></i>

256
01:25:29,163 --> 01:25:30,769
They're coming...

257
01:25:30,870 --> 01:25:32,835
Bilal, watch him.

258
01:25:33,715 --> 01:25:35,207
Watch him closely.

259
01:26:26,662 --> 01:26:29,283
Open your door! We are here with your supplies.

260
01:26:40,544 --> 01:26:43,309
Calm down, brother. We're just here to help you.

261
01:26:51,380 --> 01:26:53,175
Listen, we need to see our guy.

262
01:26:53,658 --> 01:26:56,631
We've got supplies... food, water for you...

263
01:26:56,739 --> 01:26:59,590
But we need to see our captain.

264
01:27:03,698 --> 01:27:05,675
They want to see him. Bring him out.

265
01:27:05,715 --> 01:27:07,985
Bring him! Bring him!

266
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:48,775
Bring ​​him back!

267
01:27:48,815 --> 01:27:50,425
Shut up and do not move!

268
01:27:50,525 --> 01:27:52,654
Calm down, we just want to talk.

269
01:27:52,722 --> 01:27:55,665
We've got your supplies here... food, water.

270
01:27:55,731 --> 01:27:58,374
- Where's the money?
- Give me time.

271
01:28:08,632 --> 01:28:10,865
Listen, you're hurt.

272
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:14,365
We've got doctors on board.
Let us take care of you.

273
01:28:14,478 --> 01:28:17,880
Hurry up!
They're treating us like children!

274
01:28:18,545 --> 01:28:19,874
Ten million dollars.
OK?

275
01:28:19,977 --> 01:28:23,675
It is not easy, give us time.

276
01:28:23,785 --> 01:28:26,015
<i> We've got to talk about this. </ I></i>

277
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:27,854
Hurry up, I said!

278
01:28:48,209 --> 01:28:50,756
Are you crazy? What are you doing?

279
01:28:50,913 --> 01:28:52,521
You'll get us all killed!

280
01:28:52,665 --> 01:28:54,075
Do you have to talk all day?!

281
01:28:54,128 --> 01:28:57,195
You're crazy! What do you think you're doing?

282
01:28:57,226 --> 01:28:59,550
What have you done?!

283
01:28:59,734 --> 01:29:01,177
Move!

284
01:29:01,263 --> 01:29:03,896
You have to be strong to get what you want!

285
01:31:32,497 --> 01:31:34,328
Hey, this situation has gotten bad.

286
01:31:34,428 --> 01:31:37,249
There are two more ships, one on either side.

287
01:31:37,608 --> 01:31:39,326
That one is huge!

288
01:31:54,687 --> 01:31:57,830
Bilal, get the ropes!
I want him tied up.

289
01:32:01,887 --> 01:32:03,830
The other ropes...

290
01:35:01,882 --> 01:35:02,888
He got out!

291
01:35:02,904 --> 01:35:05,192
Turn the boat around!

292
01:35:05,640 --> 01:35:07,171
Bilal, you idiot!

293
01:35:21,640 --> 01:35:24,171
Turn it!  Faster, faster!

294
01:35:27,240 --> 01:35:29,171
Move, or we'll leave you!

295
01:35:54,105 --> 01:35:57,026
Find him! Don't kill him!

296
01:36:12,369 --> 01:36:13,916
Don't shoot!

297
01:36:18,926 --> 01:36:20,451
Stop! What are you doing?!

298
01:36:20,521 --> 01:36:23,075
He's getting away!

299
01:36:25,752 --> 01:36:27,220
Don't kill him!

300
01:36:27,221 --> 01:36:30,075
Better to kill him than let him escape!

301
01:36:33,590 --> 01:36:35,251
There he is!

302
01:36:38,934 --> 01:36:41,034
I'm ordering you! Don't kill him!

303
01:37:00,375 --> 01:37:02,131
Where is he?

304
01:37:07,642 --> 01:37:09,885
There he is!
There he is!

305
01:37:21,143 --> 01:37:23,665
He's here!

306
01:37:54,894 --> 01:37:56,794
Get over here! Now!

307
01:38:24,326 --> 01:38:28,831
Why did you do it?
Speak! Speak!

308
01:38:31,271 --> 01:38:32,571
Are you crazy?

309
01:38:49,213 --> 01:38:50,940
Stop him!

310
01:38:55,962 --> 01:38:57,584
That's enough!

311
01:39:02,553 --> 01:39:04,896
Don't kill him!

312
01:39:06,633 --> 01:39:08,837
If you kill him, we all die!

313
01:39:09,375 --> 01:39:11,256
What do you want me to do with him?

314
01:39:11,767 --> 01:39:13,353
What is he doing?!

315
01:39:28,238 --> 01:39:29,834
It's a helicopter.

316
01:39:30,494 --> 01:39:32,280
Get to the other side!

317
01:39:39,446 --> 01:39:40,850
Turn the boat!

318
01:39:41,063 --> 01:39:42,222
Hurry!

319
01:39:46,795 --> 01:39:47,885
Go!

320
01:39:55,110 --> 01:39:57,569
They think you are playing games.

321
01:39:57,725 --> 01:39:59,670
Do something!

322
01:40:13,562 --> 01:40:16,265
Do you want to go to an American prison?

323
01:40:17,721 --> 01:40:19,550
Is that what you want?

324
01:40:20,778 --> 01:40:22,684
I know how to handle America.

325
01:40:22,841 --> 01:40:23,956
Give me the pistol!

326
01:40:25,773 --> 01:40:27,771
They think I'm playing games, huh?

327
01:41:25,328 --> 01:41:29,010
They have no respect for us. You want to play games?

328
01:41:33,411 --> 01:41:35,825
Give me the radio!

329
01:41:36,667 --> 01:41:40,112
The helicopter is coming back.

330
01:41:44,197 --> 01:41:47,035
America, you must stop this now!

331
01:41:47,111 --> 01:41:50,125
I'm going to kill this Irish.
I will kill him!

332
01:41:50,239 --> 01:41:52,339
You! Don't stand there!

333
01:41:59,557 --> 01:42:02,181
Talk! Talk!

334
01:43:05,937 --> 01:43:06,928
They know us!

335
01:43:21,315 --> 01:43:23,405
It's a lie.

336
01:43:33,311 --> 01:43:35,356
It's a trap. It's a trap.

337
01:43:52,833 --> 01:43:54,665
This is definitely a trap.

338
01:45:19,505 --> 01:45:21,496
You have to be strong.

339
01:45:21,505 --> 01:45:23,496
Don't let anyone in.

340
01:45:31,632 --> 01:45:33,820
Whatever happens, don't stop.

341
01:45:34,052 --> 01:45:35,633
It's my job.

342
01:51:20,451 --> 01:51:21,868
What's going on?!

343
01:51:22,125 --> 01:51:23,806
I can't see.

344
01:51:24,926 --> 01:51:26,220
Give me the radio!

345
01:51:31,438 --> 01:51:35,085
Too much light.
We no see.

346
01:52:27,706 --> 01:52:30,496
Keep it steady... Keep it steady!

347
01:53:18,388 --> 01:53:20,458
It's getting rough!

348
01:53:21,271 --> 01:53:23,120
Keep it straight!

349
01:54:04,524 --> 01:54:05,536
Slow down!

350
01:54:08,613 --> 01:54:11,152
What kind of games are they playing?

351
01:54:12,497 --> 01:54:15,648
I can't hold it straight!

352
01:54:17,986 --> 01:54:20,775
Be a man. Just shut up and steer!

353
01:54:36,168 --> 01:54:39,207
<i> Can you hear me? How much longer? </ I></i>

354
01:56:02,620 --> 01:56:04,758
<i> Do you hear me? </ I></i>

355
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:08,475
<i> I speak to Muse. </ I></i>

356
01:56:08,602 --> 01:56:11,784
<i> I want to speak with him. </ I></i>

357
01:56:36,677 --> 01:56:38,607
What are you writing?

358
01:56:54,754 --> 01:56:55,985
Stop him!

359
01:56:56,261 --> 01:56:57,237
Kill him!

360
01:56:57,397 --> 01:56:59,217
Bilal, stop him!

361
01:57:06,779 --> 01:57:08,425
Bring the rope.

362
01:57:23,978 --> 01:57:25,275
Tie him!

363
01:57:45,737 --> 01:57:47,760
What are you doing?!

364
01:58:23,777 --> 01:58:24,725
Shut up!

365
01:58:26,302 --> 01:58:28,456
Get a blindfold!

366
01:58:46,353 --> 01:58:47,782
Blindfold him!

367
01:59:40,267 --> 01:59:42,399
Don't kill him!
