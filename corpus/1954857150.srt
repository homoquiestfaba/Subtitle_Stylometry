1
00:01:25,181 --> 00:01:26,616
Jackhammer!

2
00:02:23,637 --> 00:02:26,806
Hi, sorry,
I'm running a little late.

3
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,475
I'm here for the role of brixon.

4
00:02:29,776 --> 00:02:30,000
Can I have
your headshot, please?

5
00:02:30,001 --> 00:02:31,745
Can I have
your headshot, please?

6
00:02:31,778 --> 00:02:34,280
Yes.

7
00:02:34,313 --> 00:02:36,883
Gavin, what's going on, buddy?
How you been?

8
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:38,552
It's Julius.

9
00:02:38,585 --> 00:02:40,687
Oh. Yeah.
What are you doing here?

10
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,522
Oh, just going in for brixon.

11
00:02:43,556 --> 00:02:44,523
You're auditioning for brixon?

12
00:02:44,557 --> 00:02:46,225
Yeah.

13
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:47,226
My agent's been trying to get me
through these doors

14
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,894
for, like, two years now.

15
00:02:48,927 --> 00:02:51,330
Oh, man, it's a struggle but,
hey, you're here now.

16
00:02:51,364 --> 00:02:53,466
Yeah, I'm feeling pretty good.

17
00:02:53,499 --> 00:02:56,302
I actually just quit my job
today so I could be here.

18
00:02:56,335 --> 00:02:58,504
Wow. What's with the,
uh, bowtie?

19
00:02:58,537 --> 00:02:59,605
It's kind of weird.

20
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:00,000
Oh, well, it says in the script,

21
00:03:00,001 --> 00:03:01,707
oh, well, it says in the script,

22
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,442
I'm pretty sure,
that he's wearing a bowtie.

23
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:07,846
No, man. Cuban necktie.

24
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,614
Yeah, well,
I didn't have a Cuban necktie

25
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,616
but I had a bowtie.

26
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:13,218
That's when you cut
a guy's throat

27
00:03:13,251 --> 00:03:15,753
and you pull his tongue out,
through the throat.

28
00:03:15,787 --> 00:03:16,754
What?

29
00:03:16,788 --> 00:03:17,755
Julius Warner?

30
00:03:17,789 --> 00:03:19,324
Yes?

31
00:03:19,357 --> 00:03:20,517
<i>Let's get you in there, okay?</i>

32
00:03:21,626 --> 00:03:22,527
What?

33
00:03:24,295 --> 00:03:25,529
Members only?

34
00:03:29,033 --> 00:03:29,999
<i>Damn it.</i>

35
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,434
<i>Damn it.</i>

36
00:03:30,467 --> 00:03:35,272
Lance, I've got
Julius Warner for you.

37
00:03:35,306 --> 00:03:36,573
What are you doing?

38
00:03:36,607 --> 00:03:38,709
I thought we could squeeze
another one in.

39
00:03:38,742 --> 00:03:39,843
Cedric, are you
a senile old piece of shit?

40
00:03:39,876 --> 00:03:41,612
But I--

41
00:03:41,645 --> 00:03:43,847
You were just in my office
here two minutes ago, okay?

42
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,448
I went over the schedule
with you.

43
00:03:45,482 --> 00:03:46,883
I'm not seeing
anyone else today.

44
00:03:46,917 --> 00:03:47,951
We're done.

45
00:03:47,984 --> 00:03:48,985
What are you doing?

46
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:50,586
I--i just thought--

47
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,755
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

48
00:03:52,788 --> 00:03:54,690
What are you,
a retarded fucking seal?

49
00:03:54,724 --> 00:03:56,926
What am I, at seaworld?
With some fucking fish?

50
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,961
Do you want
some fucking mackerel?

51
00:03:58,994 --> 00:03:59,999
God, almighty. The amount of
people I work with

52
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,696
god, almighty. The amount of
people I work with

53
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:03,666
who are so fucking amateurs.

54
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:05,968
Jesus.

55
00:04:06,001 --> 00:04:07,002
Oh my god, who's this?

56
00:04:07,036 --> 00:04:08,771
Uh--

57
00:04:08,804 --> 00:04:09,939
<i>Are you auditioning
for the role of brixon?</i>

58
00:04:09,972 --> 00:04:11,306
Yes. Yes, I am.

59
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,276
Oh, you are? That's nice.

60
00:04:14,309 --> 00:04:16,278
I like that. You have a bowtie.

61
00:04:16,311 --> 00:04:17,711
That's nice.
Is that silk or cotton?

62
00:04:17,712 --> 00:04:19,714
Um, I don't know.

63
00:04:19,748 --> 00:04:21,316
No one's done that yet.

64
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:22,317
Wow.

65
00:04:22,351 --> 00:04:23,318
You like it?

66
00:04:23,352 --> 00:04:24,686
No, I don't fucking like it.

67
00:04:24,719 --> 00:04:26,455
Jesus Christ, what are you,
a chimney sweeper?

68
00:04:26,488 --> 00:04:28,823
What are you, dick Van dyke,

69
00:04:28,857 --> 00:04:29,999
<i>Are you gonna float away

70
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,058

carbon dioxide's gonna come out.

00:09:43,023 --> 00:09:45,660
Mooooo.

182
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,328
Oh.

183
00:09:51,365 --> 00:09:53,167
Ow.

184
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,302
Oh, don't pretend
like you're leaving.

185
00:09:55,335 --> 00:09:57,604
You have nowhere to live,
Julius.

186
00:10:02,276 --> 00:10:03,610
I'll let you make it up to me.

187
00:10:04,944 --> 00:10:06,680
Oh, come on.

188
00:10:06,713 --> 00:10:08,782
Let's just stop
being ridiculous.

189
00:10:08,815 --> 00:10:11,184
You know how your condition
makes you blow things

190
00:10:11,217 --> 00:10:13,352
way out of proportion.

191
00:10:13,386 --> 00:10:16,122
And you should probably
start medicating.

192
00:10:16,155 --> 00:10:18,224
You should start medicating.

193
00:10:20,026 --> 00:10:22,128
Whatever, loser!

194
00:10:22,161 --> 00:10:23,696
I hope you nailed that audition

195
00:10:23,729 --> 00:10:25,931
because you have nothing, hobo.

196
00:10:25,964 --> 00:10:27,833
Go get your condition fixed,
hobo.

197
00:10:27,866 --> 00:10:29,999
I have tennis elbow

198
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,636
I have tennis elbow

199
00:10:30,669 --> 00:10:33,405
and, yeah, I did nail
that audition today.

200
00:10:33,438 --> 00:10:35,641
I'm gonna be
the star of the show

201
00:10:35,674 --> 00:10:39,077
so suck on them carrots.

202
00:10:59,931 --> 00:11:00,000
<i>Please enjoy this ring back.</i>

203
00:11:00,001 --> 00:11:01,298
<i>Please enjoy this ring back</i>

204
00:11:01,332 --> 00:11:03,000
<i>while we connect your call.</i>

205
00:11:05,936 --> 00:11:06,903
Hammer!

206
00:11:06,937 --> 00:11:08,372
Samantha!

207
00:11:08,405 --> 00:11:09,640
Help!

208
00:11:10,841 --> 00:11:12,175
Samantha.

209
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:13,276
Samantha.

210
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:15,178
I'm here. Samantha.

211
00:11:15,211 --> 00:11:17,748
Help me.

212
00:11:18,849 --> 00:11:19,916
Samantha.

213
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,084
Be careful.

214
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:24,320
How did you cross
the sea of death

215
00:11:24,354 --> 00:11:25,956
and the mountain of death

216
00:11:25,989 --> 00:11:28,091
and the field of death
and the valley of death?

217
00:11:28,124 --> 00:11:29,925
Hammer's love is more powerful

218
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:30,000
than all the world
and the universe.

219
00:11:30,001 --> 00:11:32,228
Than all the world
and the universe.

220
00:11:32,262 --> 00:11:35,465
You know nothing about power.

221
00:11:35,498 --> 00:11:38,400
Power is in the mind.

222
00:11:38,434 --> 00:11:41,036
You're all muscle, no brain.

223
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:43,305
<i>Help me!</i>

224
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:48,177
After all this is said and done

225
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,744
you're gonna to wish
you had a pair of these.

226
00:11:49,778 --> 00:11:52,081
Hammer, be careful.

227
00:12:08,496 --> 00:12:11,332
Hammer, you're so brave.

228
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:28,081
Hammer, I want you.

229
00:12:28,115 --> 00:12:29,999
Samantha, my love.

230
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,317
Samantha, my love.

231
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:33,186
Come take me, hammer.

232
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,489
I will do anything
for your love.

233
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:38,958
Then kiss me right now.

234
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:41,261
Ha, ha, ha.

235
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:46,065
Uh?

236
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:46,999
Uh?

237
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,807
Hello?

238
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:58,244
<i>Hey, hammer, it's Julius.</i>

239
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,999
<i>I know it's been a while
but I just thought I'd--</i>

240
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,447
<i>I know it's been a while
but I just thought I'd--</i>

241
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,048
No, no, no, baby. It's all good.

242
00:13:03,081 --> 00:13:04,316
I'm just at work,

243
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:07,118
taking a power nap
in between shows.

244
00:13:07,152 --> 00:13:10,055
<i>I'm glad you called me,
it's good to hear your voice.</i>

245
00:13:10,088 --> 00:13:11,056
What's going on?

246
00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:13,291
What's new?

247
00:13:13,324 --> 00:13:14,525
Nothing much.

248
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:16,161
Yeah?

249
00:13:16,194 --> 00:13:18,229
How's you and Kelly?

250
00:13:18,263 --> 00:13:19,430
She's into animals now.

251
00:13:19,464 --> 00:13:21,799
Yeah, yeah, cool, cool.

252
00:13:21,832 --> 00:13:22,967
What?

253
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,170
Yeah.

254
00:13:25,203 --> 00:13:28,506
Things are kind of bad
at the moment, actually.

255
00:13:28,539 --> 00:13:29,999
I was hoping that maybe
I could come and stay with you

256
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,975
I was hoping that maybe
I could come and stay with you

257
00:13:31,008 --> 00:13:33,243
<i>just, you know,
until I get back on my feet.</i>

258
00:13:33,277 --> 00:13:35,946
<i>I know that I haven't
called in over a year</i>

259
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,181
and you're probably busy
with your hip hop and--

260
00:13:37,214 --> 00:13:39,016
No, no, no.

261
00:13:39,049 --> 00:13:40,550
Anything but chicken wing,
baby, you're my younger bro.

262
00:13:40,584 --> 00:13:42,086
Of course you can
come stay with the hammer.

263
00:13:42,119 --> 00:13:43,420
Don't be frickin' ridoculous.

264
00:13:43,453 --> 00:13:44,988
Thanks.

265
00:13:45,022 --> 00:13:47,257
Yeah. Want to meet
in an hour? I moved.

266
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:48,858
You moved?

267
00:13:48,892 --> 00:13:50,860
<i>What? Mom didn't tell you?</i>

268
00:13:50,894 --> 00:13:52,529
Dude, I'm living
in a pimping ass pimp place.

269
00:13:52,562 --> 00:13:54,097
It's pimping.

270
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:56,465
I got my own rapping
stripping dojo in the garage.

271
00:13:56,499 --> 00:13:57,834
<i>I built it myself.</i>

272
00:13:57,867 --> 00:13:59,999
1961 Westwood.

273
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,870
1961 Westwood.

274
00:14:00,904 --> 00:14:02,939
<i>We meet then, yeah?</i>

275
00:14:02,972 --> 00:14:04,941
Yeah. Yeah.

276
00:14:04,974 --> 00:14:06,275
I'm renting it from this cougar

277
00:14:06,309 --> 00:14:08,277
who fell in love with the hammer
at a strip show.

278
00:14:08,311 --> 00:14:09,912
Hilarious.

279
00:14:09,945 --> 00:14:12,080
It's all high end upstairs,
not really my styles,

280
00:14:12,114 --> 00:14:14,350
but I'm renting it
for dirt cheap.

281
00:14:14,383 --> 00:14:16,952
Okay. Okay, I'll see you
in a bit, okay.

282
00:14:16,985 --> 00:14:18,353
Yeah, yeah.

283
00:14:18,386 --> 00:14:20,555
Mom tell you how frickin'
thunder-ripped I am?

284
00:14:22,124 --> 00:14:24,860
I'm like perma-pumped
seven days a week.

285
00:14:26,461 --> 00:14:28,063
Hello?

286
00:14:28,096 --> 00:14:29,064
Hello?

287
00:14:29,097 --> 00:14:29,410
Jackhammer!

288
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:30,098
Jackhammer!

289
00:14:44,345 --> 00:14:47,081
Come on, man, tell me.
What happened today?

290
00:14:47,114 --> 00:14:49,083
Um, let's see.

291
00:14:49,116 --> 00:14:53,354
I woke up early, had my cereal,
took my vitamins.

292
00:14:53,387 --> 00:14:56,890
And then blew what was probably
the biggest audition of my life

293
00:14:56,923 --> 00:14:58,359
with Lance selmour

294
00:14:58,392 --> 00:14:59,409
who's basically
the Spielberg of theater.

295
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:01,094
Who's basically
the Spielberg of theater.

296
00:15:01,127 --> 00:15:03,429
Spielberg? No, he's in movies.

297
00:15:05,098 --> 00:15:06,199
Are you serious?

298
00:15:06,232 --> 00:15:08,468
Yeah, no. Steven Spielberg.

299
00:15:08,501 --> 00:15:10,303
"Jurassic park,"
"back to the future."

300
00:15:10,336 --> 00:15:12,372
Those are movies, man.

301
00:15:12,405 --> 00:15:14,974
But I'm saying,
he's the Spielberg,

302
00:15:15,008 --> 00:15:16,342
like, of the theater.

303
00:15:16,376 --> 00:15:19,445
So if, like Spielberg
was to work in theater,

304
00:15:19,479 --> 00:15:20,646
he's be like Lance selmour.

305
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,214
Yeah, no, I get
what you're saying.

306
00:15:22,247 --> 00:15:25,317
What I'm saying is
Spielberg only did movies.

307
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,919
<i>So he didn't do theater.</i>

308
00:15:26,952 --> 00:15:28,520
I'm not saying he did theater.

309
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:29,409
I'm just saying that Lance--

310
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:31,957
I'm just saying that Lance--

311
00:15:31,991 --> 00:15:36,128
Fine, he's the meryl streep
of theater?

312
00:15:36,161 --> 00:15:38,197
Bam! See, now, you're kind of
making sense.

313
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:41,032
Oh, did I mention
before I got blacklisted

314
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,968
I decided to tell my boss
at the sandwich hut

315
00:15:44,002 --> 00:15:46,471
<i>to take his chorizo
ciabatta bunwich</i>

316
00:15:46,505 --> 00:15:48,607
and shove it up his ass.

317
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,575
What? You quit your job?

318
00:15:50,609 --> 00:15:53,577
He wouldn't give me
the time off for the audition.

319
00:15:53,611 --> 00:15:55,713
I know, I'm an idiot.

320
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:58,449
At least you got the man bags
to go for what you want.

321
00:15:58,482 --> 00:15:59,409
As gay as it may be.

322
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:00,051
As gay as it may be.

323
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,220
Okay. Do you know what it means

324
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:04,422
to be blacklisted
by Lance selmour?

325
00:16:04,455 --> 00:16:05,656
Hell, yeah.

326
00:16:05,689 --> 00:16:07,491
Blue balls.

327
00:16:07,525 --> 00:16:10,360
What? No, blacklisted.

328
00:16:10,393 --> 00:16:13,196
It means I'll never work
in this town again.

329
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:15,098
If I even want to
sweep a theater,

330
00:16:15,132 --> 00:16:17,300
I'd have to take off to L.A.

331
00:16:17,334 --> 00:16:20,637
Or Boston.
I'm too broke for L.A.

332
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:22,372
I don't speak Boston.

333
00:16:22,405 --> 00:16:24,207
That shit wouldn't fly
in the '80s, dude.

334
00:16:24,241 --> 00:16:26,176
I hate power trippers.

335
00:16:26,209 --> 00:16:27,377
I feel for you, baby.

336
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:28,678
Pass me the laptop.

337
00:16:28,711 --> 00:16:29,409
I hate dudes like this, man.

338
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:31,280
I hate dudes like this, man.

339
00:16:31,313 --> 00:16:35,517
Oh, schnapps, I'm getting
my heart palpitations again.

340
00:16:35,552 --> 00:16:39,121
Whenever I get super mad
because I'm so thunderous lean,

341
00:16:39,155 --> 00:16:40,556
my heart skips a beat.

342
00:16:40,589 --> 00:16:42,724
You wouldn't understand.

343
00:16:42,758 --> 00:16:44,393
What's his name? Lance selmour?

344
00:16:44,426 --> 00:16:46,328
<i>Yeah, Lance selmour.</i>

345
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:50,450
<i>Well, guess
who's making headlines</i>

346
00:16:50,466 --> 00:16:52,668
<i>for being caught cheating again?</i>

347
00:16:52,701 --> 00:16:55,504
<i>Theater casting director,
Lance selmour.</i>

348
00:16:55,537 --> 00:16:58,039
<i>Now if you haven't been</i>

349
00:16:58,073 --> 00:16:59,409
<i>for the past, well, decade,</i>

350
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:00,208
<i>for the past, well, decade,</i>

351
00:17:00,241 --> 00:17:03,111
<i>Lance selmour was once
a mediocre theater actor</i>

352
00:17:03,144 --> 00:17:05,146
<i>who suddenly became
one of the most powerful</i>

353
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:08,583
<i>casting agents in the world
by strategically marrying</i>

354
00:17:08,616 --> 00:17:11,752
<i>92-year-old Josephine guttenberg</i>

355
00:17:11,786 --> 00:17:14,422
<i>in New York.</i>

356
00:17:14,455 --> 00:17:16,724
<i>Last night, Lance was
pulled over at 3 A.M.</i>

357
00:17:16,757 --> 00:17:19,660
<i>In his Bentley on suspicion
of drinking and driving.</i>

358
00:17:19,694 --> 00:17:22,196
<i>He was arrested for possession
of several narcotics</i>

359
00:17:22,229 --> 00:17:24,398
<i>and for soliciting a prostitute.</i>

360
00:17:24,431 --> 00:17:25,699
<i>The legal team
for Mrs. guttenberg</i>

361
00:17:25,732 --> 00:17:27,501
<i>issued a statement saying</i>

362
00:17:27,534 --> 00:17:29,409
<i>she will not be filing
for divorce at this time.</i>

363
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:30,770
<i>She will not be filing
for divorce at this time.</i>

364
00:17:30,804 --> 00:17:35,174
<i>But insiders say Lance will be</i>

365
00:17:35,209 --> 00:17:37,311
<i>and is on the verge
of losing everything</i>

366
00:17:37,344 --> 00:17:39,178
<i>if this happens again.</i>

367
00:17:39,212 --> 00:17:42,816
<i>From powerful casting director
to potential jobless bum.</i>

368
00:17:42,849 --> 00:17:45,752
<i>You got to keep it
in your pants, Lance.</i>

369
00:17:45,785 --> 00:17:48,521
Look, Jules, maybe it's time
to grow up, huh?

370
00:17:48,554 --> 00:17:51,057
Get a real job, like peeling.

371
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:54,227
What? Theater is a real job.

372
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,461
I got to get a hold of him
and apologize.

373
00:17:55,494 --> 00:17:56,462
I can't believe this.

374
00:17:56,495 --> 00:17:57,596
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

375
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,265
What you need to do, baby,
is relax.

376
00:17:59,298 --> 00:17:59,410
You're with the hammer now.
Let me take care of you.

377
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,834
You're with the hammer now.
Let me take care of you.

378
00:18:01,867 --> 00:18:03,702
I got something
that'll do you well.

379
00:18:11,709 --> 00:18:15,380
This right here, my friend,
is what they call hisca grass.

380
00:18:15,413 --> 00:18:17,782
It's more potent
than Indian peyote.

381
00:18:17,815 --> 00:18:19,284
I got it from an aboriginal guy

382
00:18:19,317 --> 00:18:21,085
that makes one of
my latest rap tracks.

383
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:28,259
Indian of sorts.

384
00:18:28,292 --> 00:18:29,409
A real native so you know
it's thunder strong.

385
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:31,428
A real native so you know
it's thunder strong.

386
00:18:31,462 --> 00:18:33,497
Cool. Okay.

387
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:36,467
So how's that going,
anyway, the rapping?

388
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,669
Cbb, buddy.
It couldn't be better.

389
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:41,172
Like bread on butter. And ham.

390
00:18:41,205 --> 00:18:43,840
I'm at the liquor store
slinging my CDs,

391
00:18:43,874 --> 00:18:45,542
clocking the cheese.

392
00:18:45,576 --> 00:18:47,411
Jiggidy jackhammer.

393
00:18:47,444 --> 00:18:50,781
Coming with the big bees.

394
00:18:50,814 --> 00:18:52,282
Oh, man.

395
00:18:52,315 --> 00:18:54,650
My rounds are usually
way tighter than that.

396
00:18:54,684 --> 00:18:57,320
It's not lyrically
connected right now.

397
00:18:57,353 --> 00:18:59,409
So at the liquor store, yeah?

398
00:18:59,410 --> 00:18:59,522
So at the liquor store, yeah?

399
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:00,915
You can make some money
doing that?

400
00:19:00,923 --> 00:19:03,659
Are you kidding?

401
00:19:03,693 --> 00:19:08,197
Big time, man. Big time.

402
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:11,300
People move
their feet 'cause I'm funky.

403
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:12,835
I'm funky.

404
00:19:12,868 --> 00:19:14,236
I'm gonna have to
call you back, I'm sorry.

405
00:19:14,269 --> 00:19:16,505
I'm funky. Yeah, ya are.

406
00:19:16,538 --> 00:19:18,140
Listen, man, here's $20.

407
00:19:18,173 --> 00:19:19,408
You got it, baby.

408
00:19:19,441 --> 00:19:21,676
No, no, no, no.
Just shut that shit off.

409
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:22,611
Seriously.

410
00:19:24,213 --> 00:19:26,381
You shut that shit off.

411
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,449
You hear me?

412
00:19:27,482 --> 00:19:29,409
You shut that shit off.

413
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:30,452
You shut that shit off.

414
00:19:30,485 --> 00:19:31,786
It's pretty competitive
out there, though.

415
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,321
There's a lot of looky-loos
and stuff, too.

416
00:19:33,354 --> 00:19:34,422
Turf wars.

417
00:19:34,455 --> 00:19:35,615
Anyway, I've just been getting

418
00:19:35,624 --> 00:19:37,425
really connected
with my lyrics lately.

419
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:39,828
I just been taking it
to a whole 'nother emotion.

420
00:19:39,861 --> 00:19:41,229
You know what I mean?

421
00:19:41,262 --> 00:19:44,498
Has mom played
any of my tracks for you?

422
00:19:44,532 --> 00:19:45,799
You wanna hear one?

423
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:47,268
Okay.

424
00:19:47,301 --> 00:19:48,902
I just laid down
the crazy crazy last night.

425
00:19:48,936 --> 00:19:50,804
Emotional, baby.
You're gonna love it.

426
00:19:50,838 --> 00:19:52,340
Ready?

427
00:19:52,373 --> 00:19:54,174
Yeah.

428
00:19:54,207 --> 00:19:55,275
You're gonna love it.

429
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:05,252
<i>Oh shit.</i>

430
00:20:05,285 --> 00:20:06,386
You all right?

431
00:20:08,355 --> 00:20:09,756
Yeah, totally.

432
00:20:09,789 --> 00:20:11,624
I'm totally fine.

433
00:20:11,658 --> 00:20:13,693
I can't believe mom hasn't
played any of my tracks.

434
00:20:13,726 --> 00:20:14,694
They're off the hill.

435
00:20:14,727 --> 00:20:16,396
I'm totally fine.

436
00:20:16,429 --> 00:20:18,197
Hang on, I've got to do
some vocals.

437
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,499
Buddy, baby, buddy, bonkers.

438
00:20:19,532 --> 00:20:21,433
Oh, shit.
Buddy, baby, buddy, bonkers.

439
00:20:21,467 --> 00:20:24,871
Protein Pete packs a powerful
potassium punch.

440
00:20:24,904 --> 00:20:27,806
I think I'm ready, baby.
Unique New York.

441
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,241
Buddy's baby, buddy's bonkers.

442
00:20:29,275 --> 00:20:29,410
Hey, little buddy.

443
00:20:29,411 --> 00:20:31,577
Hey, little buddy.

444
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:33,679
Hey, little buddy.

445
00:20:34,913 --> 00:20:37,215
What's happening, little buddy?

446
00:20:37,249 --> 00:20:38,684

I said I'll be like Crockett
because he gets the ladies.

505
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:35,428
What are you talking about?

506
00:22:35,461 --> 00:22:37,497
The "Miami vice" guys?

507
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:38,564
Fine, I don't care.

508
00:22:38,598 --> 00:22:39,632
Yeah, I'll be Crockett.

509
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:41,001
No, I'll be Crockett.

510
00:22:43,369 --> 00:22:45,105
Look, tomorrow, we're gonna
get you a job.

511
00:22:45,138 --> 00:22:47,507
Yeah, I'm introducing you
to Igor.

512
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,774
Your stripping agent?

513
00:22:48,808 --> 00:22:51,110
No way, man.
I don't want to strip.

514
00:22:51,143 --> 00:22:53,346
That's pretty fricking
ridiculous if you ask me.

515
00:22:53,379 --> 00:22:54,947
But whatever, it's your choice.

516
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,816
Igor's got a few different jobs.

517
00:22:56,849 --> 00:22:59,409
Maybe you could be a delivery
driver for his escorts.

518
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:01,490
Maybe you could be a delivery
driver for his escorts.

519
00:23:03,455 --> 00:23:05,457
How's mom? Crazy as ever.

520
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:08,393
She likes living
in a trailer park.

521
00:23:08,427 --> 00:23:10,129
But you know that,
you talk to her all the time.

522
00:23:10,162 --> 00:23:12,097
On the phone, yeah.
I haven't seen her--

523
00:23:12,131 --> 00:23:13,732
Are you gonna drink that?

524
00:23:13,765 --> 00:23:16,067
I got to, uh--

525
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:19,403
Julius, this is potent protein.

526
00:23:19,438 --> 00:23:21,773
Look at the tuna
cling to the egg yolk.

527
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:27,411
Jackhammer!

528
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:33,651
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

529
00:23:33,684 --> 00:23:35,686
Can't be bothered right now,
Mr. hammer.

530
00:23:35,719 --> 00:23:37,555
I'm his most loyal client.
Let me in there.

531
00:23:37,588 --> 00:23:39,423
I don't think so.

532
00:23:39,457 --> 00:23:41,525
Still ain't paid for the last
eight buckets you picked up.

533
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:42,560
Not very happy with you.

534
00:23:42,593 --> 00:23:44,027
This is horseshit.

535
00:23:44,061 --> 00:23:45,821
I don't have time to
barter with you, bronco.

536
00:23:45,829 --> 00:23:47,164
I'm feeling sick.

537
00:23:47,197 --> 00:23:48,431
There's no way
I'm letting you in here

538
00:23:48,465 --> 00:23:49,432
to fuck more product.

539
00:23:49,466 --> 00:23:50,433
<i>No way.</i>

540
00:23:50,467 --> 00:23:51,434
<i>Dammit!</i>

541
00:23:51,468 --> 00:23:52,635
If I could just say,

542
00:23:52,669 --> 00:23:54,104
hammer only needs to
get in there

543
00:23:54,137 --> 00:23:59,175
to extrapolate some
antidioxomicro-correlobolators.

544
00:23:59,209 --> 00:23:59,410
Yay.

545
00:23:59,411 --> 00:24:00,477
Yay.

546
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:01,878
Or else rocko is not gonna get

547
00:24:01,911 --> 00:24:03,880
his synthesizing
biceptual triceratops.

548
00:24:03,913 --> 00:24:05,582
If you could
just let us in there

549
00:24:05,615 --> 00:24:10,686
so we can magnetize insapiens
systorical functionality

550
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,054
in the membrane.

551
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:15,992
All right.

552
00:24:16,025 --> 00:24:19,428
Since you put it that way,
I suppose I could let you in.

553
00:24:19,461 --> 00:24:21,663
But no one gets in for the next
15 minutes, all right?

554
00:24:21,697 --> 00:24:23,131
Nobody gets in, nobody,
understand that?

555
00:24:23,164 --> 00:24:24,966
Let me get some protein, man.

556
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,902
<i>Put the hand out, chest high.</i>

557
00:24:31,606 --> 00:24:34,175
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What the fuck?

558
00:24:38,146 --> 00:24:40,081
<i>This is not fucking
happening, man.</i>

559
00:24:40,115 --> 00:24:41,449
Jesus Christ, bronco,

560
00:24:41,482 --> 00:24:42,917
what the fuck
are you doing, man?

561
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:45,586
<i>What do I pay you for anyway?
Piece of shit.</i>

562
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,822
<i>Hey, rocko,
I got my brother with me.</i>

563
00:24:47,855 --> 00:24:49,490
How do I know he's not a cop?

564
00:24:49,524 --> 00:24:51,859
<i>He's not the popo.</i>

565
00:24:51,892 --> 00:24:53,193
<i>Okay, come in.</i>

566
00:24:53,227 --> 00:24:55,129
Close the door,
bronco, you idiot.

567
00:24:58,132 --> 00:24:59,409
Rocko, I need the purest stuff
you can right now, baby.

568
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:00,600
Rocko, I need the purest stuff
you can right now, baby.

569
00:25:00,634 --> 00:25:02,102
<i>You know I'm good for it.</i>

570
00:25:02,136 --> 00:25:04,171
Hammer, I sponsored you
for one strip-off tournament,

571
00:25:04,204 --> 00:25:05,605
that's it.

572
00:25:05,639 --> 00:25:07,040
And you didn't even
do that good.

573
00:25:07,073 --> 00:25:08,842
Now you're
up to your ears in debt.

574
00:25:08,875 --> 00:25:09,943
<i>Do you know, most people
owe me that much money,</i>

575
00:25:09,976 --> 00:25:11,845
<i>I cut off their balls?</i>

576
00:25:11,878 --> 00:25:12,846
But I know
it's how you make a living

577
00:25:12,879 --> 00:25:14,247
so you're lucky.

578
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,514
Rocko, I got a couple of
stagettes coming up.

579
00:25:15,548 --> 00:25:16,716
<i>Just hook me up some protein</i>

580
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:17,717
<i>'til I get to the dojo.</i>

581
00:25:17,751 --> 00:25:19,085
I'm shaking rough.

582
00:25:19,118 --> 00:25:20,820
I don't even know why
I like you, hammer.

583
00:25:23,056 --> 00:25:26,625
You are looking seriously well
on polypeptides, my man.

584
00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:28,127
I'm low.

585
00:25:28,161 --> 00:25:29,409
Lucky for you,
I got something special.

586
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:30,863
Lucky for you,
I got something special.

587
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:31,897
One of a kind.

588
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:42,640
Was that aerobics
you were doing?

589
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:44,176
What?

590
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,511
No.

591
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:47,579
Do you want to
get down to business

592
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:48,880
<i>to get some protein or not?</i>

593
00:25:48,913 --> 00:25:49,814
Yeah.

594
00:25:56,688 --> 00:25:58,890
I bartered for this
with the maharaja

595
00:25:58,923 --> 00:25:59,410
during my travels to India.

596
00:25:59,411 --> 00:26:01,058
During my travels to India.

597
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:03,294
<i>Legend has it
the recipe for this bar</i>

598
00:26:03,327 --> 00:26:06,097
<i>was handed down
from father to son</i>

599
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:08,165
<i>since the ancient mesopotamians.</i>

600
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:09,666
<i>Supposedly,
the alchemists of the day</i>

601
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,902
figured out a way
to transform gold

602
00:26:11,935 --> 00:26:14,271
into pure 100% protein.

603
00:26:16,707 --> 00:26:19,643
Many men have died
for the chance

604
00:26:19,676 --> 00:26:22,145
to behold its golden shimmer.

605
00:26:22,178 --> 00:26:25,816
And here now, today,
I'm offering this to you

606
00:26:25,849 --> 00:26:29,409
on a cuff
for the low price of $320.

607
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:32,555
On a cuff
for the low price of $320.

608
00:26:35,191 --> 00:26:36,292
I'll even throw in
a couple of these.

609
00:26:36,326 --> 00:26:38,861
Deal.

610
00:26:38,894 --> 00:26:40,094
<i>Are you sure that's still good?</i>

611
00:26:40,095 --> 00:26:41,263
What's its best-before date?

612
00:26:41,296 --> 00:26:43,132
So when are you gonna pay up?

613
00:26:43,165 --> 00:26:44,634
Soon. Really soon.

614
00:26:44,667 --> 00:26:45,787
What the fuck are you doing?

615
00:26:46,969 --> 00:26:48,137
What you--
Put that back.

616
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:49,805
You're paying for all that shit.

617
00:26:51,073 --> 00:26:52,574
Put 'em on my tab.

618
00:26:52,607 --> 00:26:54,176
Hammer, you've got
serious problems.

619
00:26:54,209 --> 00:26:56,145
If you don't come through,
I'm cutting you off.

620
00:26:56,178 --> 00:26:58,079
Rocko don't get played,
I get paid.

621
00:26:59,681 --> 00:27:01,015
Fuck!

622
00:27:01,049 --> 00:27:02,317
<i>Close the fucking door, bronco.</i>

623
00:27:02,351 --> 00:27:03,585
<i>Goddamned tinkerbell.</i>

624
00:27:04,986 --> 00:27:06,588
<i>- I am agent.
- Trust me.</i>

625
00:27:06,621 --> 00:27:09,590
No money in acting.
Only money in strip show.

626
00:27:09,624 --> 00:27:12,360
You only have one agent,
me, Igor, nobody else.

627
00:27:12,393 --> 00:27:15,029
Besides, you're too skinny
and ugly for acting.

628
00:27:15,063 --> 00:27:19,033
Igor Face
like Jean-Claude Van damme.

629
00:27:19,067 --> 00:27:20,968
Greatest actor ever.

630
00:27:21,001 --> 00:27:24,338
You not understand.
Need long dong is gone.

631
00:27:27,274 --> 00:27:29,409
You better be a strip show..

632
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:30,530
You better be a strip show..

633
00:27:31,845 --> 00:27:33,280
Dongy dong, you're not seriously

634
00:27:33,313 --> 00:27:35,282
leaving the business,
are you, baby?

635
00:27:35,315 --> 00:27:37,584
I'm gonna miss
our tag team duos, man.

636
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,688
Judo jock. Karate cock.

637
00:27:52,298 --> 00:27:53,265
Bff.

638
00:27:53,299 --> 00:27:55,234
Balls for fans, baby.

639
00:27:55,267 --> 00:27:56,168
Bff.

640
00:27:57,436 --> 00:27:58,805
What's going on?

641
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,041
<i>I tell you one last time,</i>

642
00:28:02,074 --> 00:28:04,110
They were on deposit.

643
00:28:04,143 --> 00:28:06,978
<i>This is not my problem, no.</i>

644
00:28:07,012 --> 00:28:09,781
No! What D'you mean?

645
00:28:09,815 --> 00:28:11,049
Igor, this is my
younger brother, Julius.

<i>Speak English.</i>

00:28:24,395 --> 00:28:25,396
<i>Born in America.</i>

Okay, thank you.

654
00:28:27,298 --> 00:28:28,866
<i>You don't understand

I tell you again.
I speak English.

658
00:28:35,072 --> 00:28:36,874
Igor, this is my brother,
Julius.

659
00:28:36,907 --> 00:28:38,008
He's looking for work.

<i>Work here now expired.</i>

661
00:28:40,878 --> 00:28:42,046
No, why you call police?

662
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:43,113
Just give me two minutes.

663
00:28:43,147 --> 00:28:44,348
<i>What? No, listen.</i>

<i>You're from America?</i>

667
00:28:47,784 --> 00:28:48,918
And he's got a big dick.

668
00:28:50,254 --> 00:28:52,356
How big? Huge, huge.

669
00:28:52,389 --> 00:28:53,790
This is my younger brother, julius,

670
00:28:53,823 --> 00:28:57,293
aka big dick Julius,
aka horse boy,

671
00:28:57,326 --> 00:28:59,228
<i>tripod commander, anaconda kid.</i>

672
00:28:59,262 --> 00:28:59,410
He's big like me,

673
00:28:59,411 --> 00:29:00,429
He's big like me,

674
00:29:00,463 --> 00:29:01,464
Really? How he's your brother?

675
00:29:01,497 --> 00:29:03,399
He look like nothing like you.

676
00:29:03,432 --> 00:29:04,400
<i>- Different fathers.
- Different father.</i>

677
00:29:04,433 --> 00:29:06,102
Big time.

678

So what he do then?
He's strip show like you?

679
00:29:08,004 --> 00:29:09,472
<i>- Bam, that's what.
- I'm talking about.</i>

680
00:29:09,505 --> 00:29:11,425
And you know you shorted me
for last week's stag.

681
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,109
No! No stripping for me.

682
00:29:14,143 --> 00:29:15,411
So what's he do then?

683
00:29:15,444 --> 00:29:17,313
I don't know.

684
00:29:17,346 --> 00:29:20,148
I guess he could be
a little delivery driver

685
00:29:20,182 --> 00:29:22,117
<i>for your escorts.</i>

686
00:29:24,052 --> 00:29:26,488
Okay, I'll pay you $75

<i>Good?</i>

690
00:29:29,457 --> 00:29:31,259
<i>Sure, yeah, I can do that.</i>

691
00:29:31,293 --> 00:29:32,827
You're starting tomorrow, yes?

692
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:33,761
Yes.

693
00:29:34,862 --> 00:29:35,763
Here.

694
00:29:38,966 --> 00:29:40,335
<i>Hey, I know
you got paid for that stag</i>

695
00:29:40,368 --> 00:29:41,436
<i>and the money's in the drawer.</i>

696
00:29:41,469 --> 00:29:42,470
Why don't you just pay me?

697
00:29:42,504 --> 00:29:44,205
What's the dealy for, really?

698
00:29:44,238 --> 00:29:46,107
Yeah, yeah, don't worry. What's
his name again?

699
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,108
<i>Julius.</i>

700
00:29:47,141 --> 00:29:48,509
Okay, so you tell Julius

701
00:29:48,542 --> 00:29:50,411
<i>sometimes these bitches
are very dangerous.</i>

702
00:29:50,444 --> 00:29:52,179
<i>These girls
are not like real humans</i>

703
00:29:52,213 --> 00:29:53,847
so you tell him
he is never safe.

704
00:29:53,881 --> 00:29:56,417
Watch out. Go, tell him, go!

705
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:57,884
He wanted me to tell you

706
00:29:57,918 --> 00:29:59,153
that these escorts
are not like real humans.

707
00:29:59,186 --> 00:29:59,410
Yeah, I know.

708
00:29:59,411 --> 00:30:00,787
Yeah, I know.

709
00:30:00,821 --> 00:30:01,821
<i>They're dangerous, these--</i>

710
00:30:01,822 --> 00:30:02,723
I got it.

711
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:06,359
So are you gonna pay me?

712
00:30:06,392 --> 00:30:07,528
Soon, real soon.

713
00:30:07,561 --> 00:30:08,529
Hold on.

714
00:30:08,562 --> 00:30:10,030
C'mon, Igor.

715
00:30:10,063 --> 00:30:12,165
You know hammer
don't get played.

716
00:30:12,198 --> 00:30:14,367
I get paid.

717
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,802
Then I get laid, in the shade.

718
00:30:16,836 --> 00:30:19,505
I'm all about the spray fade,
hammer's on a crusade.

719
00:30:19,539 --> 00:30:21,141
<i>Stripper of the decade.</i>

720

<i>I keep my rhymes
tighter than a blade,</i>

721
00:30:23,343 --> 00:30:25,044
stronger than a grenade.

722
00:30:25,077 --> 00:30:26,779
Escalade, lemonade.

723
00:30:26,812 --> 00:30:27,513
Yeah.

724
00:30:29,048 --> 00:30:29,618
Jackhammer!

725
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:30,149

726
00:30:32,184 --> 00:30:33,819

00:30:38,857 --> 00:30:40,192
<i>Why are you waiting?</i>

731
00:30:40,225 --> 00:30:42,794
Put on the clothes
I left for you right there.

732
00:30:42,827 --> 00:30:45,230
Don't even think about
wearing your fairy outfits

733
00:30:45,264 --> 00:30:46,531
and get dressed.

734
00:30:46,565 --> 00:30:47,566

<i>What?</i>

736
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,068
I said it's time

737
00:30:50,101 --> 00:30:51,570

738
00:30:51,603 --> 00:30:53,071
<i>I said</i> hammer <i>gets to stanko.</i>

739
00:30:53,104 --> 00:30:54,305

00:31:23,066 --> 00:31:24,901
Samantha?

753
00:31:24,935 --> 00:31:27,837
The same Samantha
from a couple of years ago?

754
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:29,618
<i>The stewardess?
Didn't you used to like her?</i>

756

What? No.

757
00:31:33,276 --> 00:31:35,578
You know the hammer
don't do relationships.

758
00:31:35,612 --> 00:31:38,014
I don't like anybody, ever.

759
00:31:43,252 --> 00:31:44,320
You happy?

760
00:31:44,353 --> 00:31:46,088
I'm proud of you, Jules.

761
00:31:46,122 --> 00:31:48,090
You might even get laid tonight.

762
00:31:48,124 --> 00:31:49,325
And more important,

763
00:31:49,358 --> 00:31:51,060
are my hammies looking
chisel-ripped?

764
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:56,131
Why do you care?
We're going to a party.

765
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:58,934
You don't know when
your pants coming off.

766
00:31:58,967 --> 00:31:59,618
That's the mystery of life.

767
00:31:59,619 --> 00:32:00,969
That's the mystery of life.

768
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:03,038
So?

769
00:32:03,071 --> 00:32:05,340
Yeah, no, they look fine.

770
00:32:05,373 --> 00:32:06,908
Don't lie to me, tubbs.

771
00:32:06,942 --> 00:32:08,342
It's obvious
I need more self-Tanner

772
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:09,945
to bring out the cuts.

773
00:32:09,978 --> 00:32:11,612
Here, put some on.

774
00:32:11,646 --> 00:32:14,615
I can't get all up in there.

775
00:32:14,649 --> 00:32:15,616
No.

776
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:18,453
Don't be a gay and do it.

777
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:20,521
Do it!

778
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:25,860
Get up, two hands.

779
00:32:28,162 --> 00:32:29,596
Marinade those bad boys.

780
00:32:31,498 --> 00:32:33,333
Jackhammer!

781
00:32:33,367 --> 00:32:35,001
Whose party is this anyway, man?

782
00:32:35,035 --> 00:32:37,337
This party's a friend of mine,
Jason harinals.

783
00:32:37,371 --> 00:32:39,439
Ah, you know a dude named
Jason hairy balls?

784
00:32:39,473 --> 00:32:41,375
No, I said Jason harinals.

785
00:32:41,408 --> 00:32:43,009
It's what I said, hairy balls.

786
00:32:43,042 --> 00:32:44,978
There he is. Jason.

787
00:32:46,479 --> 00:32:49,648
Samantha, you look amazing.
Thanks for coming.

788
00:32:49,683 --> 00:32:50,683
Care to see my abs?

789
00:32:50,717 --> 00:32:52,118
Ooh, have you been working out?

790
00:32:52,151 --> 00:32:53,386
No, all natural.

791
00:32:53,419 --> 00:32:54,453
<i>Oh, right.</i>

792
00:32:54,487 --> 00:32:55,454
<i>Not gonna get some schnooky?</i>

793
00:32:55,488 --> 00:32:56,455
Oh, yeah.

794
00:32:59,092 --> 00:32:59,618
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow it down.

795
00:32:59,619 --> 00:33:01,026
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow it down.

796
00:33:01,059 --> 00:33:03,329
You the one they call
Jason hairy balls?

797
00:33:13,538 --> 00:33:16,674
Hello, one inch, if not more.

798
00:33:17,976 --> 00:33:20,278
Mine two, if not more.

799
00:33:21,746 --> 00:33:24,516
I guess that's
a respectable length.

800
00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:25,517
Back at ya.

801
00:33:27,352 --> 00:33:28,252
Cool.

802
00:33:29,754 --> 00:33:31,422
Whatever.

803
00:33:31,455 --> 00:33:33,725
Okay, whatever.

804
00:33:33,758 --> 00:33:35,326
Well, whatever.

Whatever. What ever.

Look, I'm not gonna--
Whatever!

Whatever, whatever,

Look, I'll see you around

813

See, I'm telling you, baby.

830
00:34:20,335 --> 00:34:21,737
All you need to do

831
00:34:21,771 --> 00:34:23,505
is get into doing some peeling
with the hammer.

832
00:34:23,538 --> 00:34:25,618
You make more in one night
than you do the whole week

833
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:28,343
driving those crazy broads
around in a dumb limo.

834
00:34:28,377 --> 00:34:29,618

This is true.

837
00:34:32,314 --> 00:34:33,782
What's up?

838
00:34:33,815 --> 00:34:35,617
<i>See, pretty pants,
you never listen to me, man.</i>

839
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:36,751
I know. You'll have enough money

840
00:34:36,785 --> 00:34:38,252
to pack up and be in Boston

841
00:34:38,286 --> 00:34:40,655
before your casting season
even starts.

842
00:34:40,689 --> 00:34:42,423
Hey, you like Russian sausage?

843
00:34:42,456 --> 00:34:46,094
<i>Get away from me,

844
00:34:46,127 --> 00:34:47,128

846
00:34:48,762 --> 00:34:50,464

847
00:34:50,498 --> 00:34:51,765
Hey, you want
a jackhammer poster.

848
00:34:51,799 --> 00:34:53,301
Why would I want your poster?

849
00:34:53,334 --> 00:34:55,369
Jackhammer, baby,
award-winning peeler.

850
00:34:55,403 --> 00:34:56,437
Bam.

851
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:58,772
Eugh, I don't watch peelers.

852
00:34:58,806 --> 00:34:59,618
Good. Move it along then.

853
00:34:59,619 --> 00:35:00,579
Good. Move it along then.

854
00:35:00,608 --> 00:35:01,709
There's a line-up.

855
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:04,678
<i>Yeah, baby, you made it.</i>

856
00:35:04,712 --> 00:35:05,679
Come here.

857
00:35:05,713 --> 00:35:07,214
Oh yeah.

858
00:35:07,247 --> 00:35:10,117
With Frederick fruitcake.

859
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:12,052
This place is tight.

860
00:35:12,085 --> 00:35:13,620
Who owns it?

861
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,355
Anyway, man, this is tubbies,
I was telling you about.

862
00:35:15,388 --> 00:35:16,356
<i>What are you drinking?</i>

863
00:35:16,389 --> 00:35:17,290
A passion--

864
00:35:20,092 --> 00:35:21,227
Ladies, meet hammer.

865
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,429
Hi, hammer.

866
00:35:22,462 --> 00:35:23,429
What's up, ladies.

867
00:35:23,463 --> 00:35:24,543
I discovered hammer in '04.

868
00:35:24,564 --> 00:35:26,165
His show at the rub 'n stub,

869
00:35:26,198 --> 00:35:27,266
mesmerizing.

870
00:35:27,299 --> 00:35:28,667
Hmm, it is pretty good.

871
00:35:28,701 --> 00:35:29,618
Yeah, now go hit the tanning.

872
00:35:29,619 --> 00:35:30,739
Yeah, now go hit the tanning.

873
00:35:30,769 --> 00:35:32,338
Anyway, man, I'm telling you.

874
00:35:32,371 --> 00:35:33,672
Jules won't listen to me, man.

875
00:35:33,705 --> 00:35:35,674
If he wants to make
the real decent dollars,

876
00:35:35,707 --> 00:35:37,343
he's got to christen
those living room doors, man.

877
00:35:37,376 --> 00:35:38,644
He won't listen to me.

878
00:35:38,677 --> 00:35:40,246
There is absolutely no way you'd
make it

879
00:35:40,279 --> 00:35:42,314
as a peeler right now, chump,
let me tell you that.

880
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:43,749
But I could work with this.

881
00:35:43,782 --> 00:35:45,250
You could train him, though,
baby.

882
00:35:45,283 --> 00:35:46,417
You need to strengthen
your core.

883
00:35:46,451 --> 00:35:47,485
Neuroflexin.
Work on your reflexes.

884
00:35:47,518 --> 00:35:48,519
Hopscotch. Endurance.

885
00:35:48,553 --> 00:35:49,520
Thighmaster. Bicycling.

886
00:35:49,554 --> 00:35:50,521
That monkey thing.

887
00:35:50,555 --> 00:35:51,522
One-armed push-ups.

888
00:35:51,556 --> 00:35:52,523
Hammy stretchers.

889
00:35:52,557 --> 00:35:53,658
Calisthenics and thrusting.

890
00:35:53,691 --> 00:35:55,226
Those lines that you run
at the gym.

891

Bam.

898
00:36:03,701 --> 00:36:05,235
You should do this.
I already told hammer--

899
00:36:05,269 --> 00:36:06,404
Jules.

900
00:36:06,437 --> 00:36:07,738
Frederick reigned the world

peeling stage
for six years, man.

902
00:36:09,807 --> 00:36:11,642
I wouldn't let him train me
if he wasn't the best.

903
00:36:11,676 --> 00:36:13,677
This is a huge opportunity
for you, man.

904
00:36:13,711 --> 00:36:14,711
Do it. Do it.

905
00:36:14,745 --> 00:36:16,213
Do it. Do it. Do it.

906
00:36:16,246 --> 00:36:17,614
Absolutely.

907
00:36:17,647 --> 00:36:20,417
Saskatchewan peel-off champion
'94 to '97.

908
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:21,885
There's no way
that I'm stripping.

909
00:36:21,918 --> 00:36:24,821
I just-i can't.
I'm sorry, I can't.

910
00:36:26,623 --> 00:36:28,157
Look, Rick.

911
00:36:28,191 --> 00:36:29,618
I've had some material issues
growing up too.

912
00:36:29,619 --> 00:36:29,859
I've had some material issues

913
00:36:29,893 --> 00:36:31,460
Forget about your mother.

914
00:36:31,495 --> 00:36:33,496
But then I tried on
that first thong

915
00:36:33,529 --> 00:36:35,598
and it fit like a glove.

916
00:36:35,631 --> 00:36:37,767
My life has never been
the same since.

917
00:36:37,801 --> 00:36:39,335
Think about that.

918
00:36:49,945 --> 00:36:50,846
You'll come around.

919
00:36:51,947 --> 00:36:53,248

Come here.

922
00:37:05,693 --> 00:37:08,330
Just curious, baby.
You know what these are?

923
00:37:08,363 --> 00:37:09,331
Phone numbers.

924
00:37:09,364 --> 00:37:10,332
For women.

925
00:37:10,365 --> 00:37:11,766
They give 'em to me

926
00:37:11,799 --> 00:37:13,719
because they know
that peelers bought the cheese.

927
00:37:13,735 --> 00:37:16,437
God, you're relentless.
Okay, fine.

928
00:37:16,471 --> 00:37:18,405
How much do you guys
actually make?

929
00:37:18,439 --> 00:37:20,407
400 bones, baby. One dance.

930
00:37:20,441 --> 00:37:21,909
You don't go full nude.

931
00:37:21,943 --> 00:37:24,378
Tie-offs, pull some g-strings,
do your little routine.

932
00:37:24,411 --> 00:37:25,846
Bam, that's it.

933
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:28,349
Handful of dollars,
handful of numbers.

934
00:37:28,382 --> 00:37:29,618
This is ridiculous.
What's tie-off?

935
00:37:29,619 --> 00:37:30,751
This is ridiculous.
What's tie-off?

936
00:37:30,784 --> 00:37:33,487
You don't know?

937
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,956
Julius, drink. Come on.

938
00:37:35,989 --> 00:37:37,591
Wanna know?

939
00:37:37,624 --> 00:37:39,425
<i>- Not really.</i>
- Do you want some?

940
00:37:41,361 --> 00:37:42,896
Look, you do what you gotta do

941
00:37:42,929 --> 00:37:44,898
to get yourself a chubby,
all right? A big one.

942
00:37:44,931 --> 00:37:47,633
You know what that is, right?
Hm.

943
00:37:47,667 --> 00:37:49,735
Then, you take an elastic band
so it's nice and tight,

944
00:37:49,769 --> 00:37:51,337
you fold it in two
and then you release it

945
00:37:51,371 --> 00:37:52,772
around the base
of your pajang jang.

946
00:37:52,805 --> 00:37:55,375
Bam. It's hard while you do
your whole routine.

947
00:37:55,408 --> 00:37:57,510
It's beautiful.
Hurts a little bit.

948
00:37:57,543 --> 00:37:59,479
Got to just go use the washroom
before I do a show.

949
00:37:59,512 --> 00:37:59,619
I got my elastics,
I got my porn mags,

950
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:02,314
I got my elastics,
I got my porn mags,

951
00:38:02,347 --> 00:38:05,550
or I use images
from my huge library of memories

952
00:38:05,584 --> 00:38:06,919
because I got lots of 'em.

953
00:38:06,952 --> 00:38:08,921
400 bucks, one dance?

954
00:38:08,954 --> 00:38:10,789
That's what I'm
talking about, baby. Yeah.

955
00:38:10,822 --> 00:38:13,592
I wouldn't even know what to do.

956
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:16,328
When the pupil is ready,
the teacher shall appear.

957
00:38:16,361 --> 00:38:18,963
I'll be your Swayze,
you be my baby.

958
00:38:18,997 --> 00:38:20,599
No, no, baby,
you ain't thinking about it.

959
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:22,266
You're doing it,
you're doing it now.

960
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:26,204
Caboose, caboose,
caboose, caboose.

961
00:38:29,941 --> 00:38:31,642
Fine, I'll do it.

962
00:38:31,675 --> 00:38:33,411
Yeah, baby, put it right here.

963
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:34,612
Bam. That's what
I'm talking about.

964
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,347
Whoa, yeah.

965
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,881
Hey, aren't you friends
with that Russian dude?

966
00:38:37,915 --> 00:38:39,783
Why?

He's gonna get his ass beat.

970
00:38:44,054 --> 00:38:46,423

take that guy anywhere.

Ha, ha, ha, ha.

972

am I glad you showed up.

1089
00:45:46,925 --> 00:45:48,393
I've been hitting up
your digits all day long,

1090
00:45:48,427 --> 00:45:49,394
like a crazy stalker.

1091
00:45:49,428 --> 00:45:51,095
Come on, hammer,

1092
00:45:51,129 --> 00:45:54,032
you know how unreliable
my cell phone battery is.

1093
00:45:54,065 --> 00:45:54,065
Hey, Julius.

1094
00:45:54,066 --> 00:45:56,100
Hey, Julius.

1095
00:45:56,134 --> 00:45:57,101
I hear you're
gonna be joining us.

1096
00:45:57,135 --> 00:45:58,169
Congratulations, kid.

1097
00:45:58,202 --> 00:45:59,370
Oh, hey, Max glutes.Thanks.

1098
00:45:59,403 --> 00:46:01,105
Well, what do you mean,
for what?

1099
00:46:01,139 --> 00:46:03,975
Todsies, guess what?

1100
00:46:04,008 --> 00:46:06,810
I got you in the 6-man
bubble bath, baby.

1101
00:46:06,844 --> 00:46:08,112
Thank me later.

1102
00:46:08,146 --> 00:46:09,813
Protein shots on the house.

1103
00:46:09,847 --> 00:46:12,283
Protein shots.
Extra polypeptides.

1104
00:46:12,316 --> 00:46:14,885
The 6-man what?
What are you guys--

1105
00:46:14,918 --> 00:46:16,286
Are you kidding me?

1106
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:18,889
Baby, the annual
6-man bubble bath show, man.

1107
00:46:18,922 --> 00:46:20,223
It's huge.

1108
00:46:20,257 --> 00:46:21,992
It's, like, the opportunity
of the year.

1109
00:46:22,025 --> 00:46:23,927
Tonight? No, hammer, I can't.

1110
00:46:23,961 --> 00:46:24,065
I'm in a lot of pain right now.

1111
00:46:24,066 --> 00:46:25,796
I'm in a lot of pain right now.

1112
00:46:25,829 --> 00:46:28,999
And I almost had an old lady
die on me today.

1113
00:46:29,032 --> 00:46:32,735
I have old ladies
die on me all the time.

1114
00:46:32,769 --> 00:46:34,137
It's, like,
part of the job, baby.

1115
00:46:34,171 --> 00:46:35,838
Look, you're never
gonna be a PRO peeler

1116
00:46:35,872 --> 00:46:37,239
if you let little things
like that get in the way.

1117
00:46:37,274 --> 00:46:39,976
I don't want to be
a professional peeler, hammer.

1118
00:46:40,009 --> 00:46:41,844
I'm just doing this
so I can make enough money

1119
00:46:41,878 --> 00:46:45,081
to get out of this town
and pursue my career.

1120
00:46:45,114 --> 00:46:47,817
Okay, dubblies, I'm gonna
come clear, all right?

1121
00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:50,419
Me and some of the boys
are suspecting that Tony,

1122
00:46:50,452 --> 00:46:52,221
he's got fungus infection, man.

1123
00:46:52,254 --> 00:46:54,064
He's been itching
and scratching all day.

1124
00:46:54,065 --> 00:46:54,290
He's been itching
and scratching all day.

1125
00:46:54,323 --> 00:46:56,825
Come on, man, you can't let me
get into a warm bubble bath

1126
00:46:56,858 --> 00:46:58,727
with fungus-foot Tony.

1127
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:00,028
Help me out, man.

1128
00:47:00,061 --> 00:47:03,098
Hey, hammer.
Is he ready for wardrobe?

1129
00:47:03,131 --> 00:47:04,299
Fine, hammer.

1130
00:47:04,332 --> 00:47:05,867
If you need me, I'll do it.

1131
00:47:05,901 --> 00:47:07,102
Bam, that's what
I'm talking about.

1132
00:47:07,135 --> 00:47:08,804
Hey, Tony, ha, ha, ha,
you're out.

1133
00:47:08,837 --> 00:47:09,917
I ain't got no fungal foot.

1134
00:47:09,938 --> 00:47:10,839
<i>Beat it.</i>

1135
00:47:21,849 --> 00:47:23,384
Time's up, hammer.

1136
00:47:23,418 --> 00:47:24,064
Rocko seriously needs his money.

1137
00:47:24,065 --> 00:47:24,952
Rocko seriously needs his money.

1138
00:47:24,985 --> 00:47:26,386
Bronco, what's up, baby?

1139
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:28,255
It's not exactly the best time.

1140
00:47:28,288 --> 00:47:31,826
But if we had time
to be septualizing--

1141
00:47:31,859 --> 00:47:33,227
I don't think so.

1142
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:34,428
First time, not nice.

1143
00:47:34,461 --> 00:47:35,862
Second time, got me twice.

1144
00:47:35,896 --> 00:47:37,064
It's time you pay the Piper.

1145
00:47:37,097 --> 00:47:38,065
I'm gonna send your shipments--

1146
00:47:38,098 --> 00:47:39,466
Whoa, whoa, whoa, bronco.

1147
00:47:39,499 --> 00:47:41,268
No reason to start getting
all crazy, all right?

1148
00:47:41,301 --> 00:47:42,902
<i>Nobody's gonna get
hammer's shipment.</i>

1149
00:47:42,936 --> 00:47:45,305
How much do I still
owe you guys?

1150
00:47:45,339 --> 00:47:50,143
Let me see, paid half so $2500.

1151
00:47:50,176 --> 00:47:52,879

00:48:03,522 --> 00:48:04,490
I thought you were in between--

1161
00:48:04,523 --> 00:48:05,991
Yeah, I know, I know.

1162
00:48:06,024 --> 00:48:07,864
I borrowed it from you
from underneath the bed.

1163
00:48:07,893 --> 00:48:09,161
What?

1164
00:48:09,194 --> 00:48:10,328
It's all good, baby.

1165
00:48:10,362 --> 00:48:11,530
I'll make it you back.

1166
00:48:11,564 --> 00:48:13,532
Hammer, bubble-bubbles,
bubble-bubbles.

1167
00:48:13,566 --> 00:48:15,333
All right, listen, we're gonna
do the bubble bath show.

1168
00:48:15,367 --> 00:48:16,869
We're gonna cop
some serious cheese, all right?

1169
00:48:16,902 --> 00:48:19,004
I'll get you tonight. Cool?

1170
00:48:19,037 --> 00:48:21,006
All right.

1171
00:48:21,039 --> 00:48:24,064
Okay, well, why don't you just
take everything I've got then?

1172
00:48:24,065 --> 00:48:24,109
Okay, well, why don't you just
take everything I've got then?

1173
00:48:24,142 --> 00:48:26,010
Here, here's my last $100
in tips.

1174
00:48:26,043 --> 00:48:27,245
Yeah?

1175
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:29,013
Bam, that's what
I'm talking about.

1176
00:48:29,046 --> 00:48:30,948
$100 right here, baby.

1177
00:48:30,982 --> 00:48:32,550
Pow! That makes it $2,400.

1178
00:48:32,584 --> 00:48:34,185
Tonight.

1179
00:48:34,218 --> 00:48:35,252
<i>Three minutes to show time,
everyone,</i>

1180
00:48:35,286 --> 00:48:36,988
<i>three minutes to show time.</i>

1181
00:48:37,021 --> 00:48:38,155
All right, baby, let's get
your money back, all right?

1182
00:48:38,189 --> 00:48:39,857
We're gonna do the bubble bath

1183
00:48:39,891 --> 00:48:42,059
and then I'm gonna go see Igor
about my next booking.

1184
00:48:42,093 --> 00:48:43,527
<i>Bubble-bubble, baby,
bubble-bubbles.</i>

1185
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:45,429
This is why I stopped
returning your calls

1186
00:48:45,462 --> 00:48:46,930
in the first place.

1187
00:48:46,963 --> 00:48:48,865
You get me involved
in crazy scenarios

1188
00:48:48,899 --> 00:48:50,267
and then I'm always the one

1189
00:48:50,301 --> 00:48:53,437
that ends up having to pay
for your mistakes.

1190
00:48:53,470 --> 00:48:54,064
What's wrong with you, baby?
Tonight's deadly night.

1191
00:48:54,065 --> 00:48:56,006
What's wrong with you, baby?
Tonight's deadly night.

1192
00:48:56,039 --> 00:48:57,173
We're gonna make
some crazy money.

1193
00:48:57,207 --> 00:48:58,842
Bubble-bubbles, baby,
bubble-bubbles.

1194
00:48:58,875 --> 00:49:02,212
No, no.
Tonight's a horrible night.

1195
00:49:02,245 --> 00:49:04,014
Tonight's the night
that I realize

1196
00:49:04,047 --> 00:49:07,283
that I've been stupid to think
that you'd changed.

1197
00:49:07,317 --> 00:49:09,585
Why the hell am I always
listening to you anyway?

1198
00:49:11,454 --> 00:49:13,589
It's 'cause I'm the hammer

1199
00:49:13,623 --> 00:49:16,592
and you're always up to stupid
gay shit, that's why.

1200
00:49:16,626 --> 00:49:18,894
Oh yeah? Like listening to you
about stripping?

1201
00:49:18,928 --> 00:49:20,863
Oh, you don't want to
go there, little brother.

1202
00:49:20,896 --> 00:49:22,297
I'm an award-winning peeler.

1203
00:49:22,331 --> 00:49:24,064
Plus stripping
is a respectable profession.

1204
00:49:24,065 --> 00:49:24,599
Plus stripping
is a respectable profession.

1205
00:49:24,633 --> 00:49:26,501
It's tough for a lot of peelers
<i>make it through college, man.</i>

1206
00:49:26,535 --> 00:49:28,003
What?

1207
00:49:28,037 --> 00:49:29,171
You wouldn't know
about a college

1208
00:49:29,204 --> 00:49:31,040
if it landed
in your protein shake.

1209
00:49:31,073 --> 00:49:33,542
I'm making
my own rap album, dude.

1210
00:49:33,575 --> 00:49:36,545
It's like a school of rapping.
It's the exact same thing.

1211
00:49:36,578 --> 00:49:38,347
Rapping and stripping?

1212
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:39,381
Why don't you grow up?

1213
00:49:39,414 --> 00:49:40,882
You're 32 years old.

1214
00:49:40,915 --> 00:49:43,518
Why don't you turn straight?
You're 27.

1215
00:49:43,552 --> 00:49:45,620
That fairy theater shit
is embarrassing.

1216
00:49:45,654 --> 00:49:48,289
You're bringing down the whole
family name, you know that.

1217
00:49:48,322 --> 00:49:49,891
We don't even have
the same last name.

1218
00:49:49,924 --> 00:49:51,192
You don't make any sense.

1219
00:49:51,225 --> 00:49:53,127
You don't make any sense.

1220
00:49:53,161 --> 00:49:54,064
You know what?

1221
00:49:54,065 --> 00:49:54,362
You know what?

1222
00:49:54,395 --> 00:49:56,197
You and I are nothing alike.

1223
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:58,899
You're gonna die alone
with your tied-off hard-on

1224
00:49:58,932 --> 00:50:00,434
because you only care
about yourself.

1225
00:50:00,468 --> 00:50:02,069
Oh, I only care about myself?

1226
00:50:02,102 --> 00:50:03,303
Who was stuck at home

1227
00:50:03,336 --> 00:50:05,338
babysitting your pansy ass
for three years

1228
00:50:05,372 --> 00:50:07,274
while my friends
were having glorious times?

1229
00:50:07,307 --> 00:50:09,142
Riddle me that, baby,
riddle me that.

1230
00:50:09,176 --> 00:50:11,979
That's what big brothers do
when their parents are at work.

1231
00:50:12,012 --> 00:50:13,947
What is with you
and not letting things go.

1232
00:50:13,981 --> 00:50:16,183
That was, like, 15 years ago.

1233
00:50:16,216 --> 00:50:19,286
That was three years
I lost in the '80s, man.

1234
00:50:19,319 --> 00:50:22,221
That's like 10 years
in today's time.

1235
00:50:22,255 --> 00:50:24,064
<i>Plus, I'm not the one
who left mom</i>

1236
00:50:24,065 --> 00:50:24,090
<i>plus, I'm not the one
who left mom</i>

1237
00:50:24,123 --> 00:50:26,292
to go live with a yuppie.

1238
00:50:26,325 --> 00:50:28,294
Walter was my dad.

1239
00:50:28,327 --> 00:50:29,962
There you go,
doing that gay shit again.

1240
00:50:29,996 --> 00:50:31,030
See, I don't speak the language

1241
00:50:31,063 --> 00:50:32,564
of the land of the fairies.

1242
00:50:32,598 --> 00:50:35,534
I knew I couldn't
count on you for nothin'.

1243
00:50:35,567 --> 00:50:37,569
This was a huge mistake.

1244
00:50:37,603 --> 00:50:40,306
I actually thought
that you were helping me.

1245
00:50:40,339 --> 00:50:42,341
<i>Forget it.</i>

1246
00:50:42,374 --> 00:50:44,610
I'd rather live in my Van
than be close to you.

1247
00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:49,147
I think he's adopted.

1248
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:50,682
No, that was really stupid,
hammer.

1249
00:50:50,716 --> 00:50:53,318
I can't believe you took
that money without even asking.

1250
00:50:53,351 --> 00:50:54,064
What were you thinking?

1251
00:50:54,065 --> 00:50:55,020
What were you thinking?

1252
00:50:55,053 --> 00:50:57,522
Hammer! Snap out of it.

1253
00:50:57,555 --> 00:50:58,957
<i>It's cool time.</i>

1254
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:37,293
<i>Where's my show?</i>

1255
00:51:37,326 --> 00:51:39,162
You have to be
at the regent hotel

1256
00:51:39,195 --> 00:51:40,629
in one hour.

1257
00:51:40,663 --> 00:51:42,431
At 3:15. Okay

1258
00:51:42,465 --> 00:51:45,534
they request you do genie show.

1259
00:51:45,568 --> 00:51:46,535
What?

1260
00:51:46,569 --> 00:51:48,437
No, I hate the genie show.

1261
00:51:48,471 --> 00:51:50,673
Igor, we talked about this, man.

1262
00:51:50,706 --> 00:51:52,441
You said, "no more genie show."

1263
00:51:52,475 --> 00:51:53,442
That's it, I'm not doing it.

1264
00:51:53,476 --> 00:51:54,443
<i>No genie show.</i>

1265
00:51:54,477 --> 00:51:56,044
You do this.

1266
00:51:56,078 --> 00:51:57,580
- I'm not doing it.
<i>- You do this.</i>

1267
00:51:57,613 --> 00:51:58,781
- No, I'm not doing it.
<i>- You do this.</i>

1268
00:51:58,814 --> 00:52:00,616
No, I'm not doing it.

1269
00:52:00,649 --> 00:52:01,616
You do this.

1270
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:03,051
Dammit.

1271
00:52:03,085 --> 00:52:03,465
<i>Sound like good time to me.</i>

1272
00:52:03,466 --> 00:52:04,419
<i>Sound like good time to me.</i>

1273
00:52:04,452 --> 00:52:07,022
Maybe you'll crash
some pussy too, huh?

1274
00:52:07,055 --> 00:52:08,423
<i>I'm so not into this
tonight, man.</i>

1275
00:52:08,456 --> 00:52:11,726
I'm stressing out.
I've been traumatized.

1276
00:52:11,759 --> 00:52:14,061
Plus, I hate
the genie show, man.

1277
00:52:14,095 --> 00:52:15,735
I look like a fruity
carpet-flying wizard.

1278
00:52:17,164 --> 00:52:18,800
I'm not gonna be able to
get it up tonight.

1279
00:52:18,833 --> 00:52:21,435
Look, I'm not tying off.

1280
00:52:21,468 --> 00:52:23,771
Killer, best deal laptop.

1281
00:52:23,805 --> 00:52:26,573
Yes, I have this one.
Give me credit card.

1282
00:52:26,607 --> 00:52:28,309
<i>No, give me credit card now.</i>

1283
00:52:28,342 --> 00:52:29,710
$300.

1284
00:52:29,743 --> 00:52:32,446
I throw in plastic spatula.

1285
00:52:32,479 --> 00:52:33,464
This is best deal.

1286
00:52:33,465 --> 00:52:33,714
This is best deal.

1287
00:52:33,747 --> 00:52:36,283
You no get better deal
anywhere else.

1288
00:52:36,317 --> 00:52:37,718
Okay, fine, go fuck yourself.

1289
00:52:37,751 --> 00:52:39,686
<i>You call me
and then you want laptop.</i>

1290
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:40,721
<i>Look at this thing, man.</i>

1291
00:52:40,754 --> 00:52:42,456
<i>Stupid.</i>

1292
00:52:42,489 --> 00:52:44,625
<i>The ladies don't think
it's sexy.</i>

1293
00:52:44,658 --> 00:52:47,293
They'll laugh at me, man.

1294
00:52:47,327 --> 00:52:48,729
Come on, Igor.

1295
00:52:48,762 --> 00:52:50,763
<i>Let me wear the silk pants.</i>

1296
00:52:50,796 --> 00:52:52,298
Come on, silk pants?

1297
00:52:52,332 --> 00:52:54,134
Don't make me wear
this stupid teacup thing.

1298
00:52:54,167 --> 00:52:55,835
Okay, you wear silk pants.

1299
00:52:55,868 --> 00:52:57,370
But no underwear.

1300
00:52:57,403 --> 00:52:58,404
Deal.

1301
00:52:58,438 --> 00:53:01,607
I have fixed problem for you.

1302
00:53:01,641 --> 00:53:03,464
Russian underground
erection pill.

1303
00:53:03,465 --> 00:53:03,776
Russian underground
erection pill.

1304
00:53:03,809 --> 00:53:05,578
My cousin, he make it.
He want to be chemist.

1305
00:53:05,611 --> 00:53:08,580
You take this,
you have no problem.

1306
00:53:11,450 --> 00:53:15,120
Look, I'm just taking
what I need, all right?

1307
00:53:15,154 --> 00:53:16,221
I'm leaving my bag here.

1308
00:53:18,823 --> 00:53:20,825
How long do they take
to kick in?

1309
00:53:20,859 --> 00:53:23,295
Oh, you're good. No worry.

1310
00:53:27,365 --> 00:53:31,135
Igor, what the hell was in
those pills you gave me, man?

1311
00:53:31,169 --> 00:53:33,204
My cock is so hard it hurts.

1312
00:53:33,237 --> 00:53:33,465
I can't go to the lobby
with this thing

1313
00:53:33,466 --> 00:53:34,405
I can't go to the lobby
with this thing

1314
00:53:34,438 --> 00:53:35,807
because it's pulsating.

1315
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:38,109
I don't know what's in them,
I never try it.

1316
00:53:38,142 --> 00:53:39,543
What do you mean,
you haven't tried them?

1317
00:53:39,577 --> 00:53:40,711
I told you, my cousin make them.

1318
00:53:40,744 --> 00:53:42,213
I don't trust him. He's idiot.

1319
00:53:42,246 --> 00:53:43,614
You told me he's a chemist.

1320
00:53:43,647 --> 00:53:46,183
I said he wants to be chemist.

1321
00:53:46,216 --> 00:53:48,486
What?
Put it up in your waistband.

1322
00:53:48,519 --> 00:53:50,253
Don't you think I've tried
the waistband trick?

1323
00:53:50,287 --> 00:53:52,422
You're going down, ruskie. I'm--

1324
00:53:54,357 --> 00:53:55,258
Hello?

1325
00:53:56,927 --> 00:53:58,728
Dammit.

1326
00:54:03,766 --> 00:54:04,867
Oh, shit.

1327
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:33,464
Fucking watch
your fucking shit, Aladdin.

1328
00:54:33,465 --> 00:54:34,162
Fucking watch
your fucking shit, Aladdin.

1329
00:54:34,195 --> 00:54:34,896
Yeah.

1330
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:43,438
That's Lance selmour,
with a prostitute.

1331
00:54:43,471 --> 00:54:44,372
Jules.

1332
00:54:45,473 --> 00:54:46,474
No.

1333
00:55:46,364 --> 00:55:50,002
Hey, buddy, psst, hey.
You wanna make $100?

1334
00:55:50,035 --> 00:55:51,003
Sure.

1335
00:55:51,036 --> 00:55:52,237
Okay, come here.

1336
00:55:54,339 --> 00:55:57,008
Look, all I need you to do
is keep six for hotel staff,

1337
00:55:57,042 --> 00:55:58,610
cops or management.

1338
00:55:58,643 --> 00:56:00,245
I'm just gonna take
my camera right here

1339
00:56:00,278 --> 00:56:01,413
and I'm just gonna get
some footage

1340
00:56:01,446 --> 00:56:02,447
that window right there. Cool?

1341
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:03,464
Why?

1342
00:56:03,465 --> 00:56:03,981
Why?

1343
00:56:04,015 --> 00:56:05,883
Don't worry about it,
man. It's no big deal.

1344
00:56:05,917 --> 00:56:07,318
You wanna make $100?

1345
00:56:07,351 --> 00:56:08,720
Ohh! What the hell?

1346
00:56:08,753 --> 00:56:10,021
Shit. You some kind of pervert?

1347
00:56:10,054 --> 00:56:11,455
Dammit.

1348
00:56:11,488 --> 00:56:12,757
Oh, shit, no thanks, man,
not interested.

1349
00:56:12,790 --> 00:56:13,858
No, it's not what it looks like.

1350
00:56:13,891 --> 00:56:15,826
Buddy, relax, okay? Shh, shh.

1351
00:56:15,859 --> 00:56:17,628
Look, I'm not
some kind of a pervert

1352
00:56:17,661 --> 00:56:19,596
or something, all right?

1353
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:20,831
All right, all right,
all right, buddy.

1354
00:56:20,864 --> 00:56:22,333
Come here, come here.

1355
00:56:22,366 --> 00:56:24,335
I'll tell you the truth,
all right?

1356
00:56:24,368 --> 00:56:26,837
Look, man, I'm a male stripper

1357
00:56:26,870 --> 00:56:28,371
going through some issues, okay?

1358
00:56:28,404 --> 00:56:29,940
I had to do this show
tonight, man.

1359
00:56:29,973 --> 00:56:32,042
I'm taking these underground
Russian erection pills

1360
00:56:32,075 --> 00:56:33,464
from this chemist
or thought he was a chemist

1361
00:56:33,465 --> 00:56:34,878
from this chemist
or thought he was a chemist

1362
00:56:34,911 --> 00:56:37,881
but he's just really--
Oh, don't worry about it, man.

1363
00:56:37,914 --> 00:56:40,616
Here's $100.
C'mon, let's do this.

1364
00:56:40,650 --> 00:56:42,452
Not for a measly $100.

1365
00:56:42,485 --> 00:56:45,488
I got way more money
coming down the pike, man.

1366
00:56:45,521 --> 00:56:47,523
What? What is that?

1367
00:56:47,557 --> 00:56:50,560
A vision board.
Law of attraction, man.

1368
00:56:50,593 --> 00:56:52,361
You're kidding me.
You're a bum, dude.

1369
00:56:52,394 --> 00:56:53,696
You don't want $100?

1370
00:56:57,566 --> 00:56:59,869
Freakin' perverts.

1371
00:56:59,902 --> 00:57:00,802
Dammit.

1372
00:57:02,604 --> 00:57:03,464
Freakin' bums.

1373
00:57:03,465 --> 00:57:04,025
Freakin' bums.

1374
00:57:07,709 --> 00:57:11,613
<i>Oh, I got stuff to
tenderize your meat, baby.</i>

1375
00:57:14,716 --> 00:57:18,753
Oh, ahh, ahhhh.

1376
00:57:18,787 --> 00:57:19,888
Ahhhh.

1377
00:57:19,921 --> 00:57:21,489
<i>I'm a vegetable.</i>

1378
00:57:21,522 --> 00:57:22,823
<i>I'm a rutabaga.</i>

1379
00:57:22,857 --> 00:57:23,857
Jackhammer!

1380
00:57:25,994 --> 00:57:27,628
<i>Why you walking funny?</i>

1381
00:57:27,661 --> 00:57:30,364
What do you think
I'm walking funny for, ruskie?

1382
00:57:30,398 --> 00:57:33,464
Look at that, man.
What are the freaking chances?

1383
00:57:33,465 --> 00:57:34,368
Look at that, man.
What are the freaking chances?

1384
00:57:34,402 --> 00:57:36,537
Ooh, I like. I think I know her.

1385
00:57:36,570 --> 00:57:37,538
Not the ho.

1386
00:57:37,571 --> 00:57:39,372
The guy.

1387
00:57:39,406 --> 00:57:43,043
That's that casting director guy
that blue-balled Julius.

1388
00:57:43,076 --> 00:57:44,411
He's married, remember,

1389
00:57:44,444 --> 00:57:45,445
I just caught him at the hotel

1390
00:57:45,478 --> 00:57:47,114
with this prostitute.

1391
00:57:47,147 --> 00:57:48,881
Igor, you're not
getting it, man.

1392
00:57:48,915 --> 00:57:51,351
With this, I can get Julius

1393
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:53,386
another shot
at that audition, man.

1394
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:55,488
You're an idiot.
Why do you even give shit?

1395
00:57:59,091 --> 00:58:00,426
I give a shit because I've been

1396
00:58:00,459 --> 00:58:01,994
a shitty brother my whole life.

1397
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:07,466
I never supported Julius
in anything, man.

1398
00:58:07,499 --> 00:58:10,902
Nothing,
and I just messed up bad.

1399
00:58:10,936 --> 00:58:13,972
I'm gonna put
my rap album on hold

1400
00:58:14,005 --> 00:58:16,375
so I can finally be
the brother I know I should be

1401
00:58:18,910 --> 00:58:20,479
and let Julius
go after his dream.

1402
00:58:23,481 --> 00:58:24,616
You know what I mean?

1403
00:58:27,886 --> 00:58:30,155
Have you been listening
to anything I said?

1404
00:58:30,188 --> 00:58:32,490
Yes, I said you were idiot.

1405
00:58:33,591 --> 00:58:34,625
Are you crying?

1406
00:58:34,659 --> 00:58:36,060
What? No.

1407
00:58:37,928 --> 00:58:39,697
You're an emotional pussy.

1408
00:58:39,730 --> 00:58:41,932
You selfish sponge cake,
cry me a river.

1409
00:58:41,966 --> 00:58:43,434
<i>What?</i>

1410
00:58:43,468 --> 00:58:45,102
You love bubble baths
and pink daiquiris.

1411
00:58:45,135 --> 00:58:46,103
What?

1412
00:58:46,136 --> 00:58:48,706
What? I ask you what.

1413
00:58:48,739 --> 00:58:50,941
I said I'm doing it for Julius.

1414
00:58:50,975 --> 00:58:53,077
I don't care what it takes.

1415
00:58:58,115 --> 00:58:59,783
Oh, hello, Mr. hammer.

1416
00:58:59,816 --> 00:59:00,784
<i>Nee how,</i> sue sue.

1417
00:59:00,817 --> 00:59:01,951
Is Frederick free?

1418
00:59:01,985 --> 00:59:03,464
Ooh, he and mito
are training on patio.

1419
00:59:03,465 --> 00:59:05,021
Ooh, he and mito
are training on patio.

1420
00:59:05,054 --> 00:59:06,790
It's important.

1421
00:59:06,823 --> 00:59:08,658
Ooh, I don't know.

1422
00:59:08,692 --> 00:59:09,959
Please.

1423
00:59:09,993 --> 00:59:10,960
I don't know.

1424
00:59:10,994 --> 00:59:11,961
Please.

1425
00:59:11,995 --> 00:59:13,496
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1426
00:59:13,529 --> 00:59:14,697
Follow me.

1427
00:59:28,577 --> 00:59:30,579
<i>Mr. hammer.</i>

1428
00:59:30,613 --> 00:59:31,547
Mr. hammer!

1429
00:59:49,831 --> 00:59:50,998
Hey, Freddie.

1430
00:59:51,032 --> 00:59:52,800
Hey, hammer. I got your message.

1431
00:59:52,834 --> 00:59:54,669
I was gonna call you when
I wasn't so busy working out.

1432
00:59:54,702 --> 00:59:56,804
Look, I know you're training
for the worlds and everything.

1433
00:59:56,838 --> 00:59:57,805
I'm just--

1434
00:59:57,839 --> 00:59:59,506
It's okay, gorgeous.

1435
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:01,876
Oh, baby, you look stressed.

1436
01:00:01,909 --> 01:00:03,177
Meet me in the tub.

1437
01:00:03,210 --> 01:00:04,878
I could use a tub.

1438
01:00:04,911 --> 01:00:05,488
Make me and hammer

1439
01:00:05,489 --> 01:00:06,547
make me and hammer

1440
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:09,015
two extra-strength protein
shakes on the double.

1441
01:00:13,654 --> 01:00:14,788
I said extra-strength.

1442
01:00:27,067 --> 01:00:27,967
Hmmm.

1443
01:00:29,735 --> 01:00:31,003
What's the matter?

1444
01:00:31,036 --> 01:00:32,638
When I first scouted you,
I knew, like,

1445
01:00:32,672 --> 01:00:34,840
two seconds you had
world championship potential.

1446
01:00:34,874 --> 01:00:35,488
I'm not gonna
risk my investment.

1447
01:00:35,489 --> 01:00:36,509
I'm not gonna
risk my investment.

1448
01:00:36,542 --> 01:00:38,182
Freddie, I can't do this
without you, man.

1449
01:00:40,545 --> 01:00:42,114
Ladies, go play.

1450
01:00:42,147 --> 01:00:44,283
I need to talk to hammer alone.

1451
01:00:44,316 --> 01:00:45,784
And before we get into
all the details,

1452
01:00:45,818 --> 01:00:47,019
have you actually
thought this thing through?

1453
01:00:47,052 --> 01:00:48,587
Yeah.

1454
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:49,588
I mean, do you realize
you can go to jail for this

1455
01:00:49,621 --> 01:00:50,855
for a very long time

1456
01:00:50,889 --> 01:00:52,157
and miss the world championship
of peeling?

1457
01:00:52,191 --> 01:00:53,692
Not to mention
you're on the verge of

1458
01:00:53,725 --> 01:00:55,126
having your music heard
and maybe a record deal?

1459
01:00:55,159 --> 01:00:56,995
You know what?

1460
01:00:57,028 --> 01:00:59,297
I don't care about any of
that stuff right now, Freddie.

1461
01:00:59,330 --> 01:01:01,265
All I care about is just
making it up to Julius.

1462
01:01:01,299 --> 01:01:02,601
Lance selmour
is a high-profile douche

1463
01:01:02,634 --> 01:01:03,768
but he's no pushover.

1464
01:01:03,802 --> 01:01:04,769
You're way over your head,
hammer.

1465
01:01:04,803 --> 01:01:05,488
I beg to difference.

1466
01:01:05,489 --> 01:01:06,289
I beg to difference.

1467
01:01:06,304 --> 01:01:08,606
With this footage,
he's gonna poop his pants.

1468
01:01:08,639 --> 01:01:11,175
All we gotta do is get past
the security at the Manhattan

1469
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:12,810
and, boom, we're in, baby.

1470
01:01:12,843 --> 01:01:14,212
C'mon, man, are you with me?

1471
01:01:14,245 --> 01:01:16,146
You're putting your life
on the line, hammer.

1472
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:18,616
I'm putting my life on the line?

1473
01:01:22,686 --> 01:01:25,122
Okay, I'll do it.

1474
01:01:25,155 --> 01:01:26,589
But on three conditions.

1475
01:01:26,624 --> 01:01:28,992
One, we do this
like a tag team strip show.

1476
01:01:29,026 --> 01:01:30,193
Yeah.

1477
01:01:30,227 --> 01:01:32,029
Matching accessories,
matching outfits.

1478
01:01:32,062 --> 01:01:35,265
And two, you take the lead
for once, okay?

1479
01:01:35,298 --> 01:01:35,489
And we put the pressure on him
the whole time.

1480
01:01:35,490 --> 01:01:38,067
And we put the pressure on him
the whole time.

1481
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:41,904
And three,
if everything goes well,

1482
01:01:41,938 --> 01:01:44,874
you need to train for the real
championship of peeling.

1483
01:01:46,976 --> 01:01:48,177
Bam.

1484
01:01:48,210 --> 01:01:50,212
That's what I'm talking about.

1485
01:01:50,246 --> 01:01:51,313
I'm gonna cry, baby.

1486
01:01:53,715 --> 01:01:55,284
Thank you.

1487
01:01:55,317 --> 01:01:57,853
God delivered me a gift
when he brought me you.

1488
01:02:26,747 --> 01:02:27,715
<i>How are ye going?</i>

1489
01:02:27,748 --> 01:02:29,016
Welcome to the parkside.

1490
01:02:29,049 --> 01:02:30,017
We're here
to Jimmy the lift, oy.

1491
01:02:30,050 --> 01:02:31,018
Sorry? C'mon, mate.

1492
01:02:31,051 --> 01:02:32,286
Skedaddle.

1493
01:02:32,319 --> 01:02:33,921
Skedaddle.
Skedaddly-do, get out of here.

1494
01:02:33,954 --> 01:02:35,389
Okay, I don't even know
what that means.

1495
01:02:35,422 --> 01:02:35,487
And there's nothing on the list
about repairs.

1496
01:02:35,488 --> 01:02:36,924
And there's nothing on the list
about repairs.

1497
01:02:36,957 --> 01:02:39,626
Look, mate,
you've got a 2-ton lift

1498
01:02:39,659 --> 01:02:40,939
that's
<i>dallywaggin' the dongadin.</i>

1499
01:02:40,961 --> 01:02:43,730
Right now.

1500
01:02:43,763 --> 01:02:44,731
Is that on your list, oy?
That on your list, oy?

1501
01:02:44,764 --> 01:02:46,132
Yes, is that on your list?

1502
01:02:46,166 --> 01:02:47,667
Tell him, ,
no time for a chinwag, eh?

1503
01:02:47,701 --> 01:02:48,968
Straight away, then,
get your wriggle on.

1504
01:02:49,002 --> 01:02:50,236
I don't even know
what the hell--

1505
01:02:50,269 --> 01:02:51,771
<i>On with it, on with it.</i>

1506
01:02:51,805 --> 01:02:53,673
Listen, mate,
you're always doing this.

1507
01:02:53,707 --> 01:02:55,374
<i>From now on, I'm talking
to the blokes in charge.</i>

1508
01:02:55,408 --> 01:02:58,144
<i>What a flat out waste of.</i>

1509
01:03:02,715 --> 01:03:04,683
<i>♪ I took my shovel out ♪</i>

1510
01:03:04,717 --> 01:03:05,488
<i>♪ dug myself a shallow grave ♪</i>

1511
01:03:05,489 --> 01:03:06,819
<i>♪ dug myself a shallow grave ♪</i>

1512
01:03:06,852 --> 01:03:08,654
<i>♪ offered up my soul to god ♪</i>

1513
01:03:08,687 --> 01:03:11,290
<i>♪ and waited for it
to be saved ♪</i>

1514
01:03:19,698 --> 01:03:21,099
What's up?

1515
01:03:21,133 --> 01:03:23,668
Listen, I know
we're not on the list

1516
01:03:23,701 --> 01:03:25,904
but we did get a call
from the head office.

1517
01:03:25,938 --> 01:03:28,973
And I am so tired right now.

1518
01:03:29,006 --> 01:03:32,244
All I want to do is go home,
get out of these clothes

1519
01:03:32,277 --> 01:03:35,112
and take a nice hot,
soapy shower.

1520
01:03:35,146 --> 01:03:35,489
Ah, sure.

1521
01:03:35,490 --> 01:03:36,681
Ah, sure.

1522
01:03:36,714 --> 01:03:39,083
They mess up on these lists
all the time, anyways.

1523
01:03:39,116 --> 01:03:41,686
Rico, suave, get to work.

1524
01:03:41,719 --> 01:03:43,319
Oh, yes, sorry, guys.
Go ahead, go ahead.

1525
01:03:45,256 --> 01:03:47,158
I can give you my number now
if you like.

1526
01:03:47,191 --> 01:03:48,792
Yeah, you can give me
your number.

1527
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:49,760
I'll call you.

1528
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:00,270
Ready to do this? Let's do this.

1529
01:04:06,142 --> 01:04:07,377
<i>Woo,</i>

1530
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:08,945
what the hell?

1531
01:04:08,979 --> 01:04:11,214
<i>Ooh, shit.
I knew this was coming.</i>

1532
01:04:11,247 --> 01:04:12,882
Sorry, honey,
but we're going up.

1533
01:04:12,915 --> 01:04:13,849
Oh, me too.

1534
01:04:32,935 --> 01:04:34,769
Frederick?

1535
01:04:34,803 --> 01:04:35,488
No, guadelupa.

1536
01:04:35,489 --> 01:04:36,405
No, guadelupa.

1537
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:39,208
Oh, no.

1538
01:04:39,241 --> 01:04:40,942
You're Frederick.

1539
01:04:40,975 --> 01:04:44,045
Saskatchewan peel-off champion
'94 through '97.

1540
01:04:44,078 --> 01:04:46,781
Busted.

1541
01:04:46,815 --> 01:04:48,282
Ohh.

1542
01:04:48,316 --> 01:04:49,951
Okay, busted, busted.
Isn't this your floor?

1543
01:04:49,984 --> 01:04:51,219
No, no. This is your floor.

1544
01:04:51,252 --> 01:04:52,954
No, come on, I don't want to go.

1545
01:04:52,987 --> 01:04:54,388
Listen, the elevator's
going up and you're gonna--

1546
01:04:54,422 --> 01:04:55,789
Hey, I'm a peeler too.

1547
01:04:55,823 --> 01:04:57,191
Frederick, I know that's you.

1548
01:04:57,225 --> 01:04:58,492
I know it's you.
What's your number?

1549
01:04:58,526 --> 01:05:00,228
You said you'd call me,
goddammit.

1550
01:05:01,262 --> 01:05:02,830
Groupies.

1551
01:05:02,863 --> 01:05:04,197
Wasn't that--

1552
01:05:04,231 --> 01:05:05,488
Awkward? Yeah.

1553
01:05:05,489 --> 01:05:06,049
Awkward? Yeah.

1554
01:05:26,386 --> 01:05:28,521
That's right.

1555
01:05:28,555 --> 01:05:32,191
Coming to you on a wide lens,
that's right.

1556
01:05:32,224 --> 01:05:34,827
Is he black? I don't know.

1557
01:05:34,861 --> 01:05:35,488
He looked white but, damn,
he's black down below.

1558
01:05:35,489 --> 01:05:39,365
He looked white but, damn,
he's black down below.

1559
01:05:39,398 --> 01:05:41,467
Kunta kinte.

1560
01:05:43,869 --> 01:05:45,204
What?

1561
01:05:45,237 --> 01:05:47,105
<i>Housekeeping.</i>

1562
01:05:47,138 --> 01:05:48,840
Go away.

1563
01:05:48,874 --> 01:05:50,008
<i>Housekeeping.</i>

1564
01:06:02,854 --> 01:06:04,322
What's up, Anna Nicole?

1565
01:06:04,355 --> 01:06:05,456
Ha, ha, ha!

1566
01:06:09,994 --> 01:06:11,362
How'd you like that, huh?

1567
01:06:11,396 --> 01:06:12,830
How'd you like that?

1568
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:13,931
How'd you like that?

1569
01:06:13,964 --> 01:06:14,932
How'd you like that?

1570
01:06:14,965 --> 01:06:15,933
Yes.

1571
01:06:17,067 --> 01:06:18,335
What the hell's going on?

1572
01:06:18,368 --> 01:06:19,436
Who are you?

1573
01:06:19,469 --> 01:06:20,971
Don't worry about who we are.

1574
01:06:21,005 --> 01:06:25,142
We know who we are.
It's about who you are.

1575
01:06:25,175 --> 01:06:26,510
Power trippin' douche bag.

1576
01:06:26,543 --> 01:06:28,212
Yeah, power trippin' douche bag.

1577
01:06:28,245 --> 01:06:29,446
Get the fuck out of my suite.

1578
01:06:29,479 --> 01:06:30,580
I'm gonna call security.

1579
01:06:30,614 --> 01:06:32,249
Ha, ha, I don't think so, baby.

1580
01:06:32,282 --> 01:06:33,850
Hell, no.

1581
01:06:33,883 --> 01:06:35,488
See, you're the guy
that's getting my kind,

1582
01:06:35,489 --> 01:06:35,852
see, you're the guy
that's getting my kind,

1583
01:06:35,885 --> 01:06:39,589
Julius Warner,
another shot at that audition.

1584
01:06:39,623 --> 01:06:41,224
Kilby? What up?

1585
01:06:41,257 --> 01:06:42,626
Pass him exhibit a.

1586
01:06:42,659 --> 01:06:44,493
Whoa!

1587
01:06:44,527 --> 01:06:45,962
What's up, now.

1588
01:06:45,995 --> 01:06:48,231
See on or about
the 18th day of July

1589
01:06:48,264 --> 01:06:50,099
at approximately 11:0--

1590
01:06:50,133 --> 01:06:51,100
5.

1591
01:06:51,134 --> 01:06:52,568
You, Mr. Lance selmour,

1592
01:06:52,601 --> 01:06:55,371
were engaged in
some weird ass shit.

1593
01:06:55,404 --> 01:06:56,905
Weird ass shit.

1594
01:06:56,939 --> 01:06:58,273
And it about to change
your life as you know it.

1595
01:06:58,307 --> 01:06:59,475
As you know it, son.

1596
01:06:59,508 --> 01:07:00,643
Yeah.

1597
01:07:00,676 --> 01:07:02,277
So you're screwed
right now, baby.

1598
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:03,378
Did you film this?

1599
01:07:03,411 --> 01:07:04,512
Yeah.

1600
01:07:04,546 --> 01:07:05,488
On this camera?

1601
01:07:05,489 --> 01:07:05,580
On this camera?

1602
01:07:05,613 --> 01:07:06,581
That's the one.

1603
01:07:06,614 --> 01:07:08,183
Is this your only copy?

1604
01:07:08,216 --> 01:07:09,351
You better believe it.

1605
01:07:23,297 --> 01:07:26,067
Oh, you two jackasses.

1606
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:28,569
I'm serious, are you for real?

1607
01:07:28,602 --> 01:07:31,405
Do you even know
how to tie your own shoes?

1608
01:07:31,438 --> 01:07:35,488
Jesus Christ, Shrek
and fucking super Mario.

1609
01:07:35,489 --> 01:07:35,542
Jesus Christ, Shrek
and fucking super Mario.

1610
01:07:35,576 --> 01:07:39,246
Jack black's fatter brother
and the fucking situation's

1611
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:41,114
more steroided upped brother.

1612
01:07:41,147 --> 01:07:42,383
No, wait, no. No.

1613
01:07:42,416 --> 01:07:45,652
Fucking the before
and after pictures

1614
01:07:45,686 --> 01:07:47,954
of fit for life.

1615
01:07:47,988 --> 01:07:50,056
Is that really your only copy?

1616
01:07:51,391 --> 01:07:53,159
I didn't have two cameras.

1617
01:07:53,193 --> 01:07:56,562
Okay, well, that's enough
entertainment for one day.

1618
01:07:56,596 --> 01:07:59,032
Please, get the fuck
out of my suite.

1619
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,067
<i>- Hey.</i>
- What?

1620
01:08:02,101 --> 01:08:03,102
<i>Get out!</i>

1621
01:08:03,135 --> 01:08:04,036
Oh!

1622
01:08:05,971 --> 01:08:07,172
Come here.

1623
01:08:08,674 --> 01:08:10,142
I guess it's time for plan b.

1624
01:08:11,376 --> 01:08:13,445
You want to abort him?

1625
01:08:13,478 --> 01:08:16,581
No, not that plan b.
Like a back-up plan.

1626
01:08:16,615 --> 01:08:17,935
You do have
a back-up plan, right?

1627
01:08:18,683 --> 01:08:20,185
No, we don't.

1628
01:08:22,087 --> 01:08:23,655
I know, look, all we gotta do

1629
01:08:23,688 --> 01:08:25,990
is get some incriminating photos
of him with some prostitute.

1630
01:08:26,024 --> 01:08:27,526
I'm just gonna call Igor,

1631
01:08:27,559 --> 01:08:30,161
get him to bring one of
his sleazy sluts down here.

1632
01:08:30,194 --> 01:08:31,195
I'll do it.

1633
01:08:33,097 --> 01:08:35,399
What?

1634
01:08:35,433 --> 01:08:35,489
Freddie, you know we could
have just called a girl, man.

1635
01:08:35,490 --> 01:08:38,502
Freddie, you know we could
have just called a girl, man.

1636
01:08:38,536 --> 01:08:39,537
<i>There's no time, hammer.</i>

1637
01:08:39,570 --> 01:08:41,272
Eugh!

1638
01:08:41,305 --> 01:08:43,241
<i>Oh, yeah, man.</i>

1639
01:08:43,274 --> 01:08:46,377
<i>Oh, yeah, touch me.
Touch those boobs, yeah.</i>

1640
01:08:46,410 --> 01:08:49,247
<i>Oh, yeah. Spank me.</i>

1641
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:50,981
<i>Spank me, baby.</i>

1642
01:08:51,014 --> 01:08:52,750
<i>Oh, yeah, yeah.</i>

1643
01:08:52,783 --> 01:08:55,452
<i>You like that, baby? Oh, yeah.</i>

1644
01:08:55,486 --> 01:08:58,121
<i>Thanks for putting me
in one of your movies, Lance.</i>

1645
01:08:58,155 --> 01:08:59,056
<i>Yeah.</i>

1646
01:09:00,323 --> 01:09:02,225
<i>Wake him up. Wake.</i>

1647
01:09:02,259 --> 01:09:03,260
<i>Hey!</i>

1648
01:09:03,293 --> 01:09:05,262
<i>How'd you like that?</i>

1649
01:09:05,295 --> 01:09:06,763
<i>D'you like that smell?</i>

1650
01:09:06,796 --> 01:09:09,332
Hey, exhibit b, baby.

1651
01:09:09,366 --> 01:09:10,667
What's up now?

1652
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:12,635
<i>Your wife gonna see that, baby.</i>

1653
01:09:12,669 --> 01:09:16,205
<i>And what you gonna do then?
You gonna be broke as a joke.</i>

1654
01:09:16,238 --> 01:09:17,607
<i>Yeah.</i>

1655
01:09:19,576 --> 01:09:22,044
Oh god. Is this your only copy?

1656
01:09:22,078 --> 01:09:23,746
Oh no, you don't.

1657
01:09:23,780 --> 01:09:25,114
Okay.

1658
01:09:25,147 --> 01:09:27,016
Okay, okay,
all right, all right.

1659
01:09:27,049 --> 01:09:29,118
For god's sake,
please, Jesus Christ,

1660
01:09:29,151 --> 01:09:30,119
don't show that to anyone.

1661
01:09:30,152 --> 01:09:31,153
Okay, what do you want?

1662
01:09:31,187 --> 01:09:32,754
What do I want?

1663
01:09:32,788 --> 01:09:36,725
I want you to take my client,
Julius Warner, to the top,

1664
01:09:36,758 --> 01:09:38,727
'til it just don't drop.

1665
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:40,496
<i>I tick tock, I'm playing--</i>

1666
01:09:40,529 --> 01:09:41,663
Okay, all right, fine--
<i>Chicken pox.</i>

1667
01:09:41,697 --> 01:09:43,498
I got it. <i>With the locks.</i>

1668
01:09:43,531 --> 01:09:45,133
I got it, I got it!
I got it, okay?

1669
01:09:45,166 --> 01:09:46,567
My rhyme's usually
way tighter than that.

1670
01:09:46,601 --> 01:09:48,236
Okay, all right, fine.

1671
01:09:48,269 --> 01:09:50,338
Just have this Julius Warner
meet me in New York

1672
01:09:50,371 --> 01:09:51,539
on Monday morning.

1673
01:09:51,572 --> 01:09:52,540
I'll give him the lead
in something,

1674
01:09:52,573 --> 01:09:53,708
I don't know, anything.

1675
01:09:53,741 --> 01:09:55,243
I know people. I'll make calls.

1676
01:09:55,276 --> 01:09:58,713
Deal a involved you
and some sleazy prostitute.

1677
01:09:58,746 --> 01:09:59,135
No big deal.

1678
01:09:59,136 --> 01:10:00,214
No big deal.

1679
01:10:00,247 --> 01:10:04,619
But deal b involves
you and guadelupa.

1680
01:10:06,253 --> 01:10:08,355
<i>It's whole 'nother level.</i>

1681
01:10:08,388 --> 01:10:09,456
<i>Dudey-whore level.</i>

1682
01:10:12,659 --> 01:10:15,795
Fuck! Okay, all right.

1683
01:10:15,829 --> 01:10:17,631
All right.

1684
01:10:17,664 --> 01:10:19,366
Meet me at the back lots
tomorrow.

1685
01:10:19,399 --> 01:10:21,200
My assistant
will give you $50,000

1686
01:10:21,234 --> 01:10:22,602
for whatever charity
you want, all right?

1687
01:10:22,636 --> 01:10:24,170
We clear?

1688
01:10:24,203 --> 01:10:26,139
Bam. That's what
I'm talking about.

1689
01:10:26,172 --> 01:10:27,273
Jackhammer!

1690
01:10:39,885 --> 01:10:41,420
Cookies?

1691
01:10:41,454 --> 01:10:42,187
Oh, shit.

1692
01:10:45,157 --> 01:10:46,124
Who were those guys
at the party?

1693
01:10:46,158 --> 01:10:47,493
I want to know.

1694
01:10:47,526 --> 01:10:49,562
I still can't wash
the smell of Russian

1695
01:10:49,595 --> 01:10:50,829
out of my girlfriend's hair.

1696
01:10:50,863 --> 01:10:52,264
Who were they?

1697
01:10:52,297 --> 01:10:54,399
Jesus, lady,
I'm just the gardener.

1698
01:10:54,432 --> 01:10:55,567
Just the gardener.

1699
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:57,235
Hell, no, I understand.

1700
01:10:57,269 --> 01:10:58,709
Well, why don't I harvest
these nuts?

1701
01:10:58,736 --> 01:10:59,135
Agh, wait.

1702
01:10:59,136 --> 01:11:00,505
Agh, wait.

1703
01:11:00,538 --> 01:11:01,778
I got a number for someone else.

1704
01:11:01,806 --> 01:11:03,541
He'll be there tomorrow.

1705
01:11:03,575 --> 01:11:05,310
All right. There you go.

1706
01:11:05,343 --> 01:11:06,444
I'll get a pen.

1707
01:11:08,580 --> 01:11:09,814
<i>What do you want, hammer?</i>

1708
01:11:09,847 --> 01:11:11,167
Juleses, I'm so glad
you answered.

1709
01:11:11,182 --> 01:11:12,550
Look, I made it up to you.

1710
01:11:12,584 --> 01:11:14,151
I did something for you
to make it all okay.

1711
01:11:14,185 --> 01:11:15,452
I don't need your help, hammer.

1712
01:11:15,486 --> 01:11:17,288
I'm doing perfectly fine
on my own.

1713
01:11:17,321 --> 01:11:19,390
I got you another audition
with Lance selmour.

1714
01:11:19,423 --> 01:11:20,891
What? When?

1715
01:11:20,925 --> 01:11:23,560
<i>Meet us at Igor's office
in 30 minutes.</i>

1716
01:11:23,594 --> 01:11:28,832
Okay, well, I'm just in the
middle of luncheon right now.

1717
01:11:28,865 --> 01:11:29,135
Look, man, I see things
totally differently now.

1718
01:11:29,136 --> 01:11:30,867
Look, man, I see things
totally differently now.

1719
01:11:30,901 --> 01:11:33,469
We're cut from the same cloth,
we're like brothers.

1720
01:11:33,504 --> 01:11:36,807
I mean, we are brothers.
Crockett and tubbs, baby.

1721
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:37,874
<i>Julius, you have to--</i>

1722
01:11:40,676 --> 01:11:42,278
<i>Lance giving Jules
the audition in New York,</i>

1723
01:11:42,312 --> 01:11:43,813
it's great stuff.

1724
01:11:43,846 --> 01:11:47,150
But the money part,
it's really, really wrong.

1725
01:11:47,183 --> 01:11:49,719
You can't accept it.
It changes everything.

1726
01:11:49,752 --> 01:11:50,820
<i>He doesn't care.</i>

1727
01:11:50,853 --> 01:11:52,322
We didn't ask for the money.

1728
01:11:52,355 --> 01:11:53,423
He wants to donate it.

1729
01:11:53,456 --> 01:11:54,656
You taking that money tomorrow

1730
01:11:54,657 --> 01:11:56,391
raises the stakes by tenfold.

1731
01:11:56,425 --> 01:11:57,459
I'm really going to New York?

1732
01:11:57,492 --> 01:11:58,594
Take the money.

1733
01:11:58,628 --> 01:11:59,134
The money is good part of deal.

1734
01:11:59,135 --> 01:11:59,829
The money is good part of deal.

1735
01:11:59,862 --> 01:12:00,830
We all get cash
for being involved

1736
01:12:00,863 --> 01:12:02,564
and everyone's happy.

1737
01:12:02,597 --> 01:12:04,433
Are you sure we're not gonna
go to jail for this?

1738
01:12:04,466 --> 01:12:05,834
There's no way that he's gonna
set us up to go to jail,

1739
01:12:05,867 --> 01:12:07,536
right, hammer?

1740
01:12:07,569 --> 01:12:10,239
You know I'm getting
pissed off here, right?

1741
01:12:10,272 --> 01:12:11,940
I mean, we are all
deep involved.

1742
01:12:11,973 --> 01:12:13,174
It's good for everybody.

1743
01:12:13,207 --> 01:12:14,643
Igor, it's not about you.

1744
01:12:14,676 --> 01:12:17,846
It's not about me.
It's about Julius.

1745
01:12:17,879 --> 01:12:19,514
So just stop, drop, and roll it.

1746
01:12:19,548 --> 01:12:20,514
All right?

1747
01:12:20,548 --> 01:12:21,883
Hammer?

1748
01:12:21,916 --> 01:12:24,685
There's no chance of
Mr. selmour setting us up

1749
01:12:24,718 --> 01:12:26,787
to go to jail, right?

1750
01:12:26,820 --> 01:12:29,134
I know what happens
to guys like me in the clink.

1751
01:12:29,135 --> 01:12:29,257
I know what happens
to guys like me in the clink.

1752
01:12:29,290 --> 01:12:30,958
What if he does set you up?

1753
01:12:30,991 --> 01:12:34,662
This was not part
of the plan, you guys.

1754
01:12:34,695 --> 01:12:37,264
I give up. I'm leaving.

1755
01:12:37,297 --> 01:12:38,566
What? Where are you going?

1756
01:12:46,740 --> 01:12:47,775
So...

1757
01:12:49,342 --> 01:12:51,244
You guys are being stupid
in there, hammer.

1758
01:12:51,278 --> 01:12:53,713
This was supposed to be
about you making it up to Jules

1759
01:12:53,746 --> 01:12:55,348
and not about that money.

1760
01:12:55,382 --> 01:12:56,783
Samantha, this money's
gonna help Julius

1761
01:12:56,816 --> 01:12:57,817
get set up in New York.

1762
01:12:57,850 --> 01:12:58,918
It's a no-brainer.

1763
01:12:58,951 --> 01:12:59,135
You don't need that dirty money

1764
01:12:59,136 --> 01:12:59,919
you don't need that dirty money

1765
01:12:59,952 --> 01:13:01,621
and you know that, hammer.

1766
01:13:01,654 --> 01:13:04,390
For a minute, I thought that
you were actually growing up.

1767
01:13:04,423 --> 01:13:07,426
But listening to this...

1768
01:13:07,459 --> 01:13:09,295
You know what? Forget it.

1769
01:13:09,328 --> 01:13:11,463
I got to go. I have a date.

1770
01:13:11,497 --> 01:13:13,765
What? With who?

1771
01:13:13,799 --> 01:13:16,302
Samantha! With who?

1772
01:13:16,335 --> 01:13:17,803
With the doorman.

1773
01:13:17,836 --> 01:13:19,571
From Lance's building?

1774
01:13:19,605 --> 01:13:20,972
Yeah. Gross.

1775
01:13:21,006 --> 01:13:21,973
That guy's face
looks like a horse.

1776
01:13:22,007 --> 01:13:23,675
You got to be kidding me.

1777
01:13:23,709 --> 01:13:25,711
Come on, Samantha,
you're way better than that.

1778
01:13:25,744 --> 01:13:27,478
You're hanging out
with peelers now.

1779
01:13:27,512 --> 01:13:29,134
That's another thing, hammer.
You insult everyone I date.

1780
01:13:29,135 --> 01:13:30,916
That's another thing, hammer.
You insult everyone I date.

1781
01:13:30,949 --> 01:13:32,517
Why do you do that?

1782
01:13:32,550 --> 01:13:33,852
Do you ever hear me
saying anything

1783
01:13:33,885 --> 01:13:35,820
about the little hoochies
you date?

1784
01:13:35,853 --> 01:13:37,322
What are you talking about?
You're jealous.

1785
01:13:37,355 --> 01:13:39,690
And it's so obvious
that you care for me

1786
01:13:39,724 --> 01:13:41,292
more than a friend.

1787
01:13:41,326 --> 01:13:43,728
But you don't have the balls
to say anything.

1788
01:13:43,761 --> 01:13:46,964
It's pathetic, hammer.
You're an emotional dwarf.

1789
01:13:46,997 --> 01:13:48,999
Okay, whoa, slow it down, okay?

1790
01:13:49,033 --> 01:13:52,837
Maybe he doesn't look
like a horse, that much.

1791
01:13:52,870 --> 01:13:55,605
First of all, you know
that hammer's not supposed to

1792
01:13:55,639 --> 01:13:57,607
do relationships
in my line of work.

1793
01:13:57,641 --> 01:13:59,134
People get hurt.

1794
01:13:59,135 --> 01:13:59,443
People get hurt.

1795
01:13:59,476 --> 01:14:02,579
Maybe it's hard for me
to express my emotionalities.

1796
01:14:02,612 --> 01:14:05,982
Maybe, yeah, the hammer's
had some feelings.

1797
01:14:06,015 --> 01:14:08,618
Save it, hammer. It's too late.

1798
01:14:08,652 --> 01:14:11,721
Whatever we have here,
it's over, hammer.

1799
01:14:11,755 --> 01:14:12,656
It's over.

1800
01:14:13,757 --> 01:14:15,391
Yeah?

1801
01:14:15,424 --> 01:14:17,827
Well, good, 'cause
I don't give a shit.

1802
01:14:17,861 --> 01:14:19,362
And he does look like a horse.

1803
01:14:19,395 --> 01:14:20,763
And so do you.

1804
01:14:20,796 --> 01:14:23,532
You guys could be
the horse couple big time.

1805
01:14:23,566 --> 01:14:28,036
Boy, I don't care.

1806
01:14:28,070 --> 01:14:29,134
You hear me? It's over.

1807
01:14:29,135 --> 01:14:29,572
You hear me? It's over.

1808
01:14:29,605 --> 01:14:30,873
It's over. You hear me?

1809
01:14:30,906 --> 01:14:32,007
Don't ever call me again.

1810
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:33,576
Over. It's over.

1811
01:14:50,492 --> 01:14:52,894
So what are we gonna do now?

1812
01:14:52,927 --> 01:14:56,664
And why did Igor kick me
out of his office like that?

1813
01:14:56,698 --> 01:14:59,134
He's got some serious
temper issues.

1814
01:14:59,135 --> 01:14:59,934
He's got some serious
temper issues.

1815
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:01,969
We're gonna
pack up our stuff tonight.

1816
01:15:02,003 --> 01:15:03,704
And tomorrow
after we meet Lance selmour,

1817
01:15:03,737 --> 01:15:05,572
we're driving to New York.

1818
01:15:05,606 --> 01:15:08,442
I got nothing holding me
back here now, man.

1819
01:15:08,475 --> 01:15:09,510
Nothing.

1820
01:15:09,543 --> 01:15:10,811
Okay.

1821
01:15:10,844 --> 01:15:13,514
And we'll start fresh
in New York.

1822
01:15:13,547 --> 01:15:15,782
It'll be good for both of us,
a new beginning.

1823
01:15:18,051 --> 01:15:20,554
Hammer, what's wrong
with your 'stache?

1824
01:15:20,587 --> 01:15:21,521
What?

1825
01:15:24,090 --> 01:15:26,392
Ah, dammit.

1826
01:15:26,426 --> 01:15:27,593
Crap!

1827
01:15:27,627 --> 01:15:28,962
Is that a fake moustache?

1828
01:15:28,995 --> 01:15:29,135
Yeah, this 'stache is fake.

1829
01:15:29,136 --> 01:15:30,997
Yeah, this 'stache is fake.

1830
01:15:31,031 --> 01:15:32,565
I'm a fake.

1831
01:15:32,598 --> 01:15:33,599
Why?

1832
01:15:33,633 --> 01:15:35,535
Why?

1833
01:15:35,568 --> 01:15:38,604
'Cause I can't freakin' grow
a proper one, that's why.

1834
01:15:38,638 --> 01:15:41,574
I have a condition
called moustacheopecia.

1835
01:15:41,607 --> 01:15:44,777
Patchy irregular hair growth.

1836
01:15:44,810 --> 01:15:47,646
Look.

1837
01:15:47,679 --> 01:15:48,647
Okay, that's enough.

1838
01:15:51,416 --> 01:15:52,484
I'm so ashamed, man.

1839
01:15:58,022 --> 01:15:59,134
I'm sorry I let you down,
little brother.

1840
01:15:59,135 --> 01:16:01,025
I'm sorry I let you down,
little brother.

1841
01:16:01,059 --> 01:16:03,462
What are you
talking about, hammer?

1842
01:16:03,495 --> 01:16:05,664
I don't care
about your moustache.

1843
01:16:05,697 --> 01:16:08,032
I don't know why you do.

1844
01:16:08,066 --> 01:16:09,367
I don't know.

1845
01:16:12,436 --> 01:16:14,605
I guess, if you
want to get technically

1846
01:16:14,638 --> 01:16:19,677
psychologically about it,
all my heroes growing up, man,

1847
01:16:19,710 --> 01:16:23,414
they had lush thick 'staches.

1848
01:16:23,447 --> 01:16:25,115
They were ladies' men.

1849
01:16:25,148 --> 01:16:26,817
Men's men.

1850
01:16:26,850 --> 01:16:29,052
I guess I always thought
in order to be a real stud,

1851
01:16:29,086 --> 01:16:29,135
I needed to look just like 'em.

1852
01:16:29,136 --> 01:16:31,454
I needed to look just like 'em.

1853
01:16:31,488 --> 01:16:34,157
I can't.

1854
01:16:34,191 --> 01:16:36,126
'Cause I'm a fraud, man.

1855
01:16:36,159 --> 01:16:37,995
A fake.

1856
01:16:38,028 --> 01:16:39,662
I ain't jackhammer, man.

1857
01:16:42,064 --> 01:16:43,500
I'm hammer vanilli.

1858
01:16:43,533 --> 01:16:44,867
Really?

1859
01:16:44,901 --> 01:16:47,604
C'mon, that's silly.
Name a couple.

1860
01:16:47,637 --> 01:16:49,706
What, are you kidding me, man?

1861
01:16:49,739 --> 01:16:51,473
Tom Selleck,

1862
01:16:51,507 --> 01:16:53,042
Charles Bronson,

1863
01:16:53,075 --> 01:16:55,044
Ron Jeremy, Freddie Mercury,

1864
01:16:55,077 --> 01:16:56,979
Mike ditka, Geraldo,

1865
01:16:57,013 --> 01:16:58,514
Lanny McDonald,

1866
01:16:58,547 --> 01:16:59,134
Alex trebek,

1867
01:16:59,135 --> 01:16:59,915
Alex trebek,

1868
01:16:59,949 --> 01:17:00,916
captain Morgan,

1869
01:17:00,949 --> 01:17:02,018
captain crunch.

1870
01:17:02,051 --> 01:17:04,052
Okay, okay, I get your point.

1871
01:17:06,021 --> 01:17:08,724
Cap'n crunch was always
my favorite too.

1872
01:17:08,757 --> 01:17:09,725
Yeah?

1873
01:17:19,835 --> 01:17:20,801
I'm gonna go pack.

1874
01:17:33,648 --> 01:17:35,482
What?

1875
01:17:35,516 --> 01:17:37,584
<i>- Rocko, it's hammer.
- I need to swing by.</i>

1876
01:17:37,618 --> 01:17:39,086
I need to stock up.

1877
01:17:39,119 --> 01:17:41,155
I'll need 'em for
the big apples tomorrow.

1878
01:17:41,188 --> 01:17:42,857
The emporium's closed, hammer.

1879
01:17:42,890 --> 01:17:44,658
Rocko, I'm down
on my last protein bar.

1880
01:17:44,691 --> 01:17:45,892
I'm serious.

1881
01:17:45,925 --> 01:17:47,694
I wouldn't lie to you
about this.

1882
01:17:47,727 --> 01:17:48,928
I don't want to be the one

1883
01:17:48,962 --> 01:17:50,497
to have to tell you this,
hammer.

1884
01:17:50,530 --> 01:17:52,832
But you've got a real problem.

1885
01:17:52,866 --> 01:17:54,267
<i>You need to look
at yourself in the mirror.</i>

1886
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:56,002
I do that all the time.

1887
01:17:56,035 --> 01:17:58,504
You're not listening to me.

1888
01:17:58,538 --> 01:17:59,134
I'm gonna have to cut you off.

1889
01:17:59,135 --> 01:18:00,807
I'm gonna have to cut you off.

1890
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:02,776
There's a 10-step program
you can take.

1891
01:18:02,809 --> 01:18:04,143
It starts with an all-carb diet.

1892
01:18:04,177 --> 01:18:05,678
What?

1893
01:18:05,711 --> 01:18:07,780
I'm sorry. Good luck, hammer.

<i>- God. Geez, help.</i>
- Julius.

1905

<i>- God. Geez, help.</i>
- Julius.

1906
01:19:06,069 --> 01:19:07,337
Julius.

1907
01:19:07,370 --> 01:19:09,572
What are you doing down there?

1908
01:19:09,605 --> 01:19:11,842
You're interrupting my moments.

1909
01:19:11,875 --> 01:19:14,210
<i>Help, help. Help, hammer.</i>

1910
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:18,081
<i>They got me.</i>

1911
01:19:26,121 --> 01:19:27,156
Igor.

1912
01:19:27,189 --> 01:19:29,134
What the hell you doing, man?

1913
01:19:29,135 --> 01:19:29,158
What the hell you doing, man?

1914
01:19:29,191 --> 01:19:31,026
You know what I do.

1915
01:19:31,060 --> 01:19:33,162
You got greedy with money
and tried screwing me.

1916
01:19:33,195 --> 01:19:34,763
Not very American of you.

1917
01:19:34,797 --> 01:19:36,731
Look, you're not being
very '80s right now.

1918
01:19:36,765 --> 01:19:39,234
Don't make me kick
some kung-fu ass up in here.

1919
01:20:08,128 --> 01:20:10,297
Okay, stop. Let Julius go.

1920
01:20:11,965 --> 01:20:13,667
So I have deal for you.

1921
01:20:13,701 --> 01:20:16,003
I take my share of the money,
we split 50-50.

1922
01:20:16,036 --> 01:20:17,004
Sound good?

1923
01:20:17,037 --> 01:20:18,305
No, don't sound good

1924
01:20:18,338 --> 01:20:21,408
'cause hammer
don't do deals, usually.

1925
01:20:21,441 --> 01:20:22,875
This is how deal go down.

1926
01:20:22,910 --> 01:20:24,311
Tomorrow, you and Julius,

1927
01:20:24,344 --> 01:20:26,679
you meet Lance selmour
like planned.

1928
01:20:26,713 --> 01:20:28,248
And I follow you
in different car,

1929
01:20:28,281 --> 01:20:29,134
make sure you're not
set up by police.

1930
01:20:29,135 --> 01:20:30,683
Make sure you're not
set up by police.

1931
01:20:30,717 --> 01:20:32,077
Then you drive away
with the money.

1932
01:20:32,084 --> 01:20:33,920
I make sure
you are not followed.

1933
01:20:33,953 --> 01:20:35,955
Then you meet me
inside this address.

1934
01:20:35,988 --> 01:20:37,123
You give me money.

1935
01:20:37,156 --> 01:20:40,426
I release you
from stripping contract.

1936
01:20:40,459 --> 01:20:44,230
Then you go New York.
We both happy.

1937
01:20:44,263 --> 01:20:45,231
No trap.

1938
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:50,169
That's my last protein bar, man.

1939
01:20:50,202 --> 01:20:51,437
Well, I forgot my lunch.

1940
01:20:51,470 --> 01:20:52,671
Don't do it.

1941
01:20:52,704 --> 01:20:55,006
I do this. Do not do it.

1942
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:56,141
I do this. Don't do it.

1943
01:20:56,174 --> 01:20:57,776
I do this. Don't do it.

1944
01:20:57,809 --> 01:20:59,134
I do this. Do not take
my last protein bar.

1945
01:20:59,135 --> 01:21:00,879
I do this. Do not take
my last protein bar.

1946
01:21:00,912 --> 01:21:02,781
I do this.

1947
01:21:02,814 --> 01:21:03,782
Dammit.

1948
01:21:13,191 --> 01:21:15,159
Damn, I hate Russians.

1949
01:21:15,192 --> 01:21:17,161
You okay? Come here.

1950
01:21:17,194 --> 01:21:18,429
We're still set.

1951
01:21:18,463 --> 01:21:19,697
Come on.

1952
01:21:19,730 --> 01:21:22,900
Seven, eight, nine and release.

1953
01:21:22,933 --> 01:21:24,434
I'm glad you're okay, tubbses.

1954
01:21:24,468 --> 01:21:25,936
He got me right in the elbow.

1955
01:21:25,970 --> 01:21:27,304
Oh, don't be such a wuss-puss.

1956
01:21:27,337 --> 01:21:28,973
I've got tennis elbow.

1957
01:21:30,107 --> 01:21:31,775
So what are we gonna do?

1958
01:21:31,808 --> 01:21:33,910
You think we could get away
without giving him the money?

1959
01:21:33,943 --> 01:21:35,445
No, not Igor, man.

1960
01:21:35,479 --> 01:21:38,415
He's been acting like
a huge homosensual lately.

1961
01:21:38,448 --> 01:21:40,850
He's backdooring everybody.

1962
01:21:40,884 --> 01:21:42,318
It's not worth it, man.

1963
01:21:42,351 --> 01:21:44,253
We'll just start fresh
in New York.

1964
01:21:47,323 --> 01:21:51,194
We got to go get some haircuts
to help me think.

1965
01:21:51,227 --> 01:21:51,948
Okay.

1966
01:21:51,949 --> 01:21:52,449
Okay.

1967
01:21:54,263 --> 01:21:56,165
<i>Please hold on the line.</i>

1968
01:21:58,033 --> 01:21:59,168
Trying to track someone down

1969
01:21:59,202 --> 01:22:00,736
and I got to listen
to this crap?

1970
01:22:04,272 --> 01:22:05,240
Who is it, and what do you want?

1971
01:22:05,273 --> 01:22:06,241
I tell you what I want.

1972
01:22:06,274 --> 01:22:07,776
I want that slimy ruskie

1973
01:22:07,810 --> 01:22:10,145
<i>who snuck into
your swank-ass party.</i>

1974
01:22:10,178 --> 01:22:13,148
Hey, hey, leave the monkey
in the corner.

1975
01:22:13,181 --> 01:22:16,884
No, leave him.
Leave him in the corner.

1976
01:22:16,918 --> 01:22:20,155
He said leave the monkey
in the corner, you stupid tit.

1977
01:22:20,188 --> 01:22:21,756
Listen to me, fruitcake.

1978
01:22:21,789 --> 01:22:21,949
I need to know exactly
where this Russian sausage

1979
01:22:21,950 --> 01:22:23,458
I need to know exactly
where this Russian sausage

1980
01:22:23,491 --> 01:22:25,092
and his beefcake boyfriend are.

1981
01:22:25,126 --> 01:22:27,261
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

1982
01:22:27,294 --> 01:22:28,930
Jackhammer.

1983
01:22:28,963 --> 01:22:30,331
Whatever.

1984
01:22:30,364 --> 01:22:32,099
Whatever, whatever,
whatever, whatever.

1985
01:22:32,133 --> 01:22:35,302
Look, I'll see you around
downtown, Charlie brown.

1986
01:22:38,505 --> 01:22:41,042
Who's gonna see who
around now, brown cow?

1987
01:22:42,876 --> 01:22:44,311
<i>I don't know
what you're talking about.</i>

1988
01:22:44,345 --> 01:22:46,046
Just pull up doodle earth.

1989
01:22:50,350 --> 01:22:51,948
Now doodle "jackhammer."

1990
01:22:51,949 --> 01:22:52,909
Now doodle "jackhammer."

1991
01:22:55,021 --> 01:22:57,490
Ha, ha, ha, we have a
track on their location.

1992
01:22:57,523 --> 01:22:59,025
Ha, ha.

1993
01:22:59,059 --> 01:23:00,826
You found them
through doodle earth?

1994
01:23:00,860 --> 01:23:03,296
Oh, yeah, it's in their
latest software update.

1995
01:23:03,329 --> 01:23:04,364
What is it, free or--?

1996
01:23:04,397 --> 01:23:05,965
No, it's 99 cents.

1997
01:23:05,998 --> 01:23:06,999
<i>That's where they get you.</i>

1998
01:23:07,032 --> 01:23:08,434
I know, right?

1999
01:23:08,468 --> 01:23:09,969
<i>We're sending you
the coordinates.</i>

2000
01:23:20,512 --> 01:23:21,948
How could I have been
so blind, tubbses?

2001
01:23:21,949 --> 01:23:22,381
How could I have been
so blind, tubbses?

2002
01:23:22,414 --> 01:23:25,450
Samantha is the only one
I've ever cared for.

2003
01:23:25,484 --> 01:23:28,019
I am an emotional dwarf.

2004
01:23:28,052 --> 01:23:30,121
Come on, hammer,
don't be ridiculous.

2005
01:23:30,154 --> 01:23:31,990
You're not an emotional dwarf.

2006
01:23:32,023 --> 01:23:33,157
Yes, I am.

2007
01:23:33,191 --> 01:23:36,561
A little man of emotions,
so to speak.

2008
01:23:36,595 --> 01:23:39,597
<i>Sometimes certain people
just take longer to realize</i>

2009
01:23:39,631 --> 01:23:41,599
what they feel inside.

2010
01:23:41,632 --> 01:23:44,535
Love is a complicated thing.

2011
01:23:44,568 --> 01:23:46,904
I guess I thought I was
protein depleted inside

2012
01:23:46,938 --> 01:23:48,972
whenever Samantha was around.

2013
01:23:49,006 --> 01:23:50,541
I got the dizzies and stuff.

2014
01:23:50,574 --> 01:23:51,942
<i>But it's too late.</i>

2015
01:23:51,975 --> 01:23:54,111
Samantha said
whatever we had was over.

2016
01:23:54,144 --> 01:23:55,546
She went with the horse.

2017
01:23:55,579 --> 01:23:57,314
You know how I feel
about horses.

2018
01:23:57,347 --> 01:23:59,216
Hammer, Samantha's upset
about getting involved

2019
01:23:59,249 --> 01:24:02,519
with Lance's blackmail money,
not about anything else.

2020
01:24:02,552 --> 01:24:03,954
Maybe we should think harder

2021
01:24:03,987 --> 01:24:05,255
about getting out of this
tomorrow

2022
01:24:05,288 --> 01:24:08,058
and start from scratch
in New York.

2023
01:24:08,091 --> 01:24:10,091
Tubbses, I guarantee you
Igor's out there right now

2024
01:24:10,093 --> 01:24:12,095
making sure that we don't
skip town tomorrow.

2025
01:24:12,129 --> 01:24:13,863
It's not worth it.

2026
01:24:13,896 --> 01:24:16,098
<i>I can't risk him putting
his dirty Russian fingers</i>

2027
01:24:16,132 --> 01:24:17,467
<i>on you again.</i>

2028
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:19,469
<i>It's disgusting.</i>

2029
01:24:19,502 --> 01:24:21,303
<i>Damn, I hate Russians.</i>

2030
01:24:21,337 --> 01:24:21,948
How you doing today?

2031
01:24:21,949 --> 01:24:22,905
How you doing today?

2032
01:24:22,939 --> 01:24:24,874
Good dude. Dude, good.

2033
01:24:24,907 --> 01:24:30,012
Need a haircut and a beard cut.

2034
01:24:30,046 --> 01:24:32,148
There's just a few people
ahead of you.

2035
01:24:32,181 --> 01:24:33,949
Can I get your name please?

2036
01:24:33,982 --> 01:24:38,019
Oh, Keith... Kiefer sutherland.

2037
01:24:42,090 --> 01:24:44,960
I'm sorry it had to
turn out this way, hammer.

2038
01:24:44,993 --> 01:24:48,329
I want to thank you for what
you're doing for me, really.

2039
01:24:48,363 --> 01:24:50,565
<i>Anything but a chicken wing,
Crockett and tubbs, baby.</i>

2040
01:24:52,100 --> 01:24:53,301
Agghhh!

2041
01:24:56,504 --> 01:24:58,339
Hammer, are you all right?

2042
01:24:58,373 --> 01:24:59,440
Hammer?

2043
01:24:59,474 --> 01:25:00,408
Hammer?

2044
01:25:03,644 --> 01:25:06,514
I told you I'd get you
basket-weaving numbnuts.

2045
01:25:06,547 --> 01:25:08,382
What's your problem, man?

2046
01:25:08,415 --> 01:25:10,450
Woman? Whatever.

2047
01:25:13,087 --> 01:25:14,221
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2048
01:25:14,254 --> 01:25:15,689
What he meant to say is,

2049
01:25:15,722 --> 01:25:18,358
we were never the ones
that you had a beef with.

2050
01:25:18,392 --> 01:25:19,993
I didn't have beef
with you, fool.

2051
01:25:20,026 --> 01:25:21,228
I'm a vegetarian.

2052
01:25:21,261 --> 01:25:21,948
But I'd make
an exception for you.

2053
01:25:21,949 --> 01:25:22,929
But I'd make
an exception for you.

2054
01:25:22,962 --> 01:25:25,198
I would eat you in a second
and your stupid friend.

2055
01:25:25,231 --> 01:25:26,466
Bellyful of a-hole.

2056
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:27,934
Oh, look.

2057
01:25:27,967 --> 01:25:30,003
We might have something
that you might like.

2058
01:25:42,248 --> 01:25:43,949
What's your problem?

2059
01:25:45,551 --> 01:25:47,686
I wanted to show you
that I wasn't playing around.

2060
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:49,555
Now, I do like rewards.

2061
01:25:49,588 --> 01:25:51,289
Start talking, fools.

2062
01:25:51,323 --> 01:25:51,948
I got to go get it.

2063
01:25:51,949 --> 01:25:53,626
I got to go get it.

2064
01:25:53,659 --> 01:25:56,094
I can go get it.
I got to go get it.

2065
01:25:56,128 --> 01:25:58,530
Faster. Faster,
talk more and faster.

2066
01:26:01,399 --> 01:26:02,559
Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.

2067
01:26:03,535 --> 01:26:06,070
Shut up. Talk, shut up, talk.

2068
01:26:06,104 --> 01:26:07,239
I'll talk to you.

2069
01:26:07,272 --> 01:26:09,474
We'll figure this all out, okay?

2070
01:26:09,507 --> 01:26:10,408
Jesus.

2071
01:26:33,263 --> 01:26:35,632
What's going on?
Did the deal go down?

2072
01:26:37,668 --> 01:26:39,469
Well, get the look out
so you can see.

2073
01:26:42,706 --> 01:26:44,274
<i>What's going on? Is money there?</i>

2074
01:26:46,042 --> 01:26:47,077
<i>Is deal go down?</i>

2075
01:26:47,110 --> 01:26:48,111
Deal go down.

2076
01:26:48,144 --> 01:26:49,245
<i>Okay, get in car.</i>

2077
01:26:53,283 --> 01:26:54,750
What you looking at?
What you see?

2078
01:26:57,286 --> 01:26:58,353
Well, give me binocular.

2079
01:27:01,757 --> 01:27:03,125
What is this piece of shit?

2080
01:27:03,158 --> 01:27:04,626
Next time, get real binocular.

2081
01:27:09,631 --> 01:27:11,166
There they are.

2082
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:15,770
I know, I am not blind.
Put down stupid binocular.

2083
01:27:31,652 --> 01:27:33,621
Make sure you stick
to the plan, alright?

2084
01:27:44,264 --> 01:27:45,533
<i>What the fuck?</i>

2085
01:27:45,566 --> 01:27:46,846
He's going in the wrong trailer.

2086
01:27:50,670 --> 01:27:51,830
What the fuck? You wait here.

2087
01:28:09,355 --> 01:28:12,624
Hammer, hammer,
you're in the wrong trailer.

2088
01:28:12,658 --> 01:28:14,460
Hammer, whose trailer is this?

2089
01:28:14,493 --> 01:28:16,095
Hey, stupid hammer.

2090
01:28:16,128 --> 01:28:18,397
Hammer, what you doing?

2091
01:28:29,708 --> 01:28:31,509
I give you job in strip show.

2092
01:28:31,543 --> 01:28:33,244
I am not a ballerina.

2093
01:28:33,278 --> 01:28:35,680
Get ready to point
your toes, little ballerina.

2094
01:28:37,415 --> 01:28:39,784
It's payback time.

2095
01:28:39,817 --> 01:28:41,486
<i>Get him, muffin.</i>

2096
01:28:43,454 --> 01:28:44,855
<i>Point your toe.</i>

2097

This is important, man.

2106

Gracias, amigos.

2107
01:29:46,281 --> 01:29:47,282

2109
01:29:51,286 --> 01:29:51,948
Hammer. What are you doing here?

2110
01:29:51,949 --> 01:29:53,588
Hammer. What are you doing here?

2111
01:29:53,621 --> 01:29:54,656

2112
01:29:54,689 --> 01:29:56,424
Samantha, no. Please.

2113
01:30:00,962 --> 01:30:03,798
Roses are red, violets are blue.

2114
01:30:03,831 --> 01:30:06,333
I know what you're thinking,
I pity the fool.

2115
01:30:08,836 --> 01:30:11,305
I'm so sorry, Sam,
I've been immature.

2116
01:30:11,338 --> 01:30:14,308
But underneath the hard hammer,
I've been a bit insecure.

2117
01:30:14,341 --> 01:30:16,943
How could I have been so blind
not to see what you did.

2118
01:30:16,977 --> 01:30:20,246
You've opened the hammer's eyes
to see that I was stupid.

2119
01:30:23,984 --> 01:30:26,820
When I met you on the plane
in seat 16c,

2120
01:30:26,853 --> 01:30:29,222
I didn't even watch
the in-flight movie

2121
01:30:29,255 --> 01:30:31,624
and I always do.

2122
01:30:31,657 --> 01:30:34,460
Since that day in the clouds,
I've been a big dork

2123
01:30:34,494 --> 01:30:36,362
but you're the Adrian
to my rocky,

2124
01:30:36,396 --> 01:30:37,997
the mindy to my mork.

2125
01:30:38,030 --> 01:30:39,632
I'm ready to change.

2126
01:30:39,665 --> 01:30:41,267
I'm ready to morph.

2127
01:30:41,301 --> 01:30:44,870
Samantha, I no longer want to be
that emotional dwarf.

2128
01:30:48,974 --> 01:30:51,948
Roses are red, violets are blue.

2129
01:30:51,949 --> 01:30:52,244
Roses are red, violets are blue.

2130
01:30:52,277 --> 01:30:55,747
I know it's too late, Samantha.

2131
01:30:55,780 --> 01:30:57,282
Let the hammer love you.

2132
01:31:06,691 --> 01:31:08,793
I love you, Samantha.

2133
01:31:08,827 --> 01:31:09,894
