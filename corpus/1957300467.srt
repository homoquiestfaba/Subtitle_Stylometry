The night George's
father died, you left.

Sorry, is that any
of your business?

547

Don't have an alibi, do you?

548
00:26:15,356 --> 00:26:19,012
You don't need an alibi unless
you're accused of something.

549

550
00:26:22,232 --> 00:26:23,843
Be careful on that island.

I don't believe
in that curse story.

00:26:29,196 --> 00:26:31,111
I know someone
killed George's father,

554
00:26:31,241 --> 00:26:32,460
and I'm gonna find out who.

555

I know I wasn't
very close with my dad

559
00:26:55,222 --> 00:26:56,615
when we were together, but...

560
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:02,055
I really did love him.

561
00:27:03,578 --> 00:27:05,885
I never doubted that.

It's just, after
my grandfather died,

563
00:27:08,409 --> 00:27:09,715
we just stopped talking.

564
00:27:09,845 --> 00:27:12,326
It was like he
shut the door on me.

565
00:27:12,456 --> 00:27:14,328
I always felt like he had a...

566
00:27:15,982 --> 00:27:18,854
...a sense of relief
when I left for college.

567
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,860
I'm sorry you didn't
get a chance to meet him.

568
00:27:24,991 --> 00:27:26,862
He would have loved you.

Your mom's there too?

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,914
Yeah.

571
00:27:37,133 --> 00:27:39,658
Half of Shoal Harbour
came out when we buried her.

572
00:27:39,788 --> 00:27:41,660
That was the saddest
day of my life.

This graveyard is why I left.

Made me feel like
I would die here, too.

You're not gonna
die here, George.

577

How can you be so sure?

578
00:28:05,031 --> 00:28:06,902
Because I'm an artist,

579
00:28:07,033 --> 00:28:09,426
and artists feel things
that non-artists can't.

580

You're gonna grow old,

that has my husband
so troubled, Jebidiah?

coming here alone that night.

for this house and island.

I don't understand.

606

The old man had a girlfriend
who lives up the coast.

607

Nobody knew, not even
me until that night.

608

He asked me to give her that
money order with a letter.

Said it was urgent.

he was already dead.

So what was the big secret?

613
00:30:11,897 --> 00:30:14,029
He'd been seeing
her for 22 years.

614
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,858
But he made me swear
not to tell anybody.

615
00:30:18,338 --> 00:30:20,340
I would have died for that man.

616
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,299
He was like a father to me.

I'm betraying him now.
