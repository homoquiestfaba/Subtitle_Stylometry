1
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,520
Jane?

2
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,360
Hey.

3
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,240
Do you want to talk about it?

4
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,120
It might help if we talked.

5
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,560
It might help me, Jane.

6
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,120
Mom's gone, Carla.

7
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,920
Talking about it can't stop
the funeral, can it?

8
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,200
<i>Painkiller One, this is Homeboy.
Do you copy? Over.</i>

9
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,000
<i>Painkiller One, do you copy?
Over.</i>

10
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,840
We're online.

11
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,440
This is Painkiller, Homeboy,
in the ballpark, ready to play.

12
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,040
Reading you, Lima-Charlie Painkiller.

13
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,400
Hold on for sat lockup.

14
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,880
<i>Roger that, Homeboy.</i>

15
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,600
<i>Holding this position for sat lockup.</i>

16
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,560
So, Captain...

17
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,400
if you could be anywhere
but this rathole right now

18
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,480
where'd you want to be?

19
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,600
That rathole across the street.

20
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,440
- You?
- That would be X-rated.

21
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,760
Be careful
what you wish for, soldier.

22
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,280
Viper team?

23
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,800
Here, Captain. Just say the word.

24
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,720
Pretty relaxed perimeter
for a heroin lab.

25
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,320
Maybe.

26
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,000
Homeboy, this is Painkiller One.

27
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,160
You reading any other
perimeter control on this location?

28
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,240
Over.

29
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,920
Negative on your perimeter,
Painkiller.

30
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,080
You have one ghost
on the front door and...

31
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,200
<i>six in the roost.</i>

32
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,560
We good to go, Homeboy?

33
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,040
It's your intel, Jane. Your call.

34
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,000
I don't like it.

35
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,360
We're all dressed up.

36
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,280
Might as well go to the dance.

37
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,320
We say Nike, Homeboy.

38
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,400
Nike.

39
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,080
You have the green, Painkiller.

40
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,080
Repeat, you have the green.

41
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,160
Roger. Out.

42
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,400
Go... go.

43
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,640
<i>Go... go.</i>

44
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,040
Go!

45
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,560
Move in. We got in.

46
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,360
Something's not right.

47
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,120
This isn't a heroin lab.

48
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,160
Painkiller Two.
Painkiller Two, come in.

49
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,240
Clear this room! Flynn!

50
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,880
Regain my team, Sergeant.

51
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,960
What?

52
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,400
Where's Flynn?

53
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,800
Captain.

54
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,960
What is this?

55
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,160
They're all like this.

56
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,000
Clear out! Get his uniform. Let's go.

57
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,920
Sergeant, help him out.

58
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,520
Move your ass!

59
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,200
Homeboy, if you copy,
we've got a bio in here.

60
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,200
I need evac
and a medical team immediately.

61
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,560
Bravo-Echo-Lima.

62
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,640
Hold your fire.

63
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,640
We are United States soldiers
on an anti-narcotics mission

64
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,400
with the full knowledge
of the Russian government.

65
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,160
<i>Painkiller One, this is Homeboy.
Do you copy? Over.</i>

66
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,560
Painkiller One, this is Homeboy.
Do you copy?

67
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,880
What's going on?

68
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,080
Where am I?

69
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,640
You're at an Army medical facility
in Virginia.

70
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,760
As you were, Captain.

71
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,520
It's good to see you, Jane.

72
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,160
How long have I been out, sir?

73
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,640
Three days here,
five days since we lost contact.

74
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,360
Five?

75
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,800
And my team?

76
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,520
We weren't able
to recover anybody else.

77
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,400
What's going on here, sir?

78
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,920
Go ahead.

79
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,280
Scar tissue, no discoloration,
no swelling.

80
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,520
Those wounds aren't five days old.

81
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,800
What's happened to me?

82
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,640
That's what we're gonna find out.

83
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,800
Have you ever heard of knocking?

84
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,560
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

85
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,640
Who are you?

86
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,760
Graham Knight. Dr. Graham Knight.

87
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,160
You're not military.

88
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,440
Me? No. I'm...
I've got a birth defect.

89
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,400
I'm a coward.

90
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,640
No, I'm what the military

91
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,360
euphemistically refers to
as a "outsource expert."

92
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,720
Expert in what?

93
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,680
I have a Ph.D. in bio-toxicology.

94
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,520
I'm a professor
at Braddock College in Maryland.

95
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:02,440
Colonel Watts asked me to head
the medical team on your case.

96
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,880
My case?

97
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,960
He wants me to help identify
what you were exposed to.

98
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,240
All right.

99
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:17,000
Special Ops Training School,
graduated in 1999.

100
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,680
Congo, 2000. Afghanistan, '01.

101
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,000
That's a very impressive résumé.

102
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,160
I'm what the government
euphemistically refers to

103
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,640
as a real "overachiever."

104
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,600
That's putting it mildly.

105
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,880
It says here that your parents died
when you were 15?

106
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,160
Raised by an older sister.

107
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,640
Parents died how?

108
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,920
Is this relevant, Doctor?

109
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,600
Family history is always relevant.

110
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,880
The Army is my family.

111
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,760
But it must have been very tough...

112
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,520
Excuse me, did I miss the part
of your résumé about pop psychology?

113
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,480
I'm just trying
to be friendly, Captain.

114
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,880
I don't need friends.

115
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,600
What I need is to get out of this box

116
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,920
find out what happened to me,
and get the people responsible.

117
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,240
You gonna help me do that?

118
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,920
You gonna let me do my job?

119
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,760
Double King with cheese,
hold the onions.

120
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,960
No, check that.

121
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,560
Make it a chili burger
with chili fries, and nachos

122
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:22,800
and a chocolate milkshake,
with whipped cream, to go.

123
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:27,160
Well, the good news is,
she's definitely not contagious.

124
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,680
And the bad news is?

125
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,920
I don't know
if I'd actually call it bad news.

126
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,680
I don't really know exactly
what I'd call it.

127
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,120
In order to ascertain
whether she was exposed

128
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,640
to a viral or bacterial agent
as she said

129
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,600
we introduced different varieties
of antigens into her blood sample.

130
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,360
Now, in order to get a baseline

131
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,360
we drew blood
from one of the technicians

132
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,880
and introduced a variation
of the measles virus.

133
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:53,080
Now, in a healthy individual

134
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,960
the natural defenses of the blood

135
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,600
will attack and kill a virus
within 45 seconds.

136
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:04,200
Now, we introduced
the same measles variation

137
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,280
with the blood drawn
from Captain Browning.

138
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,880
Wait. Can you play that back
at normal speed?

139
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,160
That...

140
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,840
that was normal speed, Colonel.

141
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,920
Which means?

142
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,400
Which means Captain Browning's
metabolic rate

143
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,880
her immune response operates
at 20 times normal speed.

144
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:31,000
Whatever she was exposed to
over there has changed her.

145
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:38,920
In other words, she's unlike
any human being on the planet.

146
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,360
Captain, this way.

147
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,160
You gonna take me to the head, too?

148
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,120
Your new quarters, Captain.

149
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,720
<i>Yes, Captain Browning?</i>

150
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,800
Oh, sorry, sorry.

151
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,840
Try knocking, right?

152
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,600
I brought you some real food.

153
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,600
The works.

154
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,680
It's not exactly health food, Doc.

155
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,960
I had to sneak it
past your bodyguards.

156
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,960
What are they gonna do, shoot me?

157
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,520
Thanks.

158
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,360
It doesn't look good for me, does it?

159
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,560
You know, Jane, there's always
two ways of looking at things.

160
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,800
It's Chinese.

161
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,720
<i>Wei Ji.</i>

162
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,280
The top part is "danger"
and the bottom is "opportunity."

163
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,520
Two characters, one word.

164
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,640
"Crisis."

165
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:33,000
Every crisis has both. Your choice.

166
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,400
- Don't you want some?
- No, I gotta go back to work and...

167
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,840
We're going to nail this thing, Jane.

168
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,200
Promise.

169
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,400
- Why weren't we informed about this?
- I don't report to you, Don.

170
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,600
This has national security
written all over it.

171
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,960
We don't even know
what we're dealing with yet.

172
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,720
For all we know, she could end up
like one of those people

173
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,160
she described in Sovetskoe.

174
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,320
- Who else knows about this?
- My medical team.

175
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,680
What does she know?

176
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,400
She's one of the most intelligent
officers I've ever known.

177
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,120
We could be sure she's putting
two and two together.

178
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,160
Well, that's what I'm afraid of.

179
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,040
An asset like that...

180
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,480
She's not an asset. She's a soldier.

181
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,800
A soldier who was shot three times

182
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,920
and recovered completely
in less than five days!

183
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,040
I want to know how that happens

184
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,120
and then I want to know
how to replicate it. Is that clear?

185
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,200
Good.

186
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,560
Hey, sis.

187
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,520
Wow, you look okay.

188
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,440
What are you doing here?

189
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,200
I got a call.

190
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,880
Let's take a walk.

191
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,680
He told me you'd been wounded.

192
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,960
I was, but I'm better now.

193
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,920
- You never were a very good liar.
- They're still doing tests.

194
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,520
- What kind of tests?
- I'm not a doctor.

195
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,640
Well, I am and I wanna know.

196
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,960
Carla, this isn't high school.
This is the military.

197
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,280
I don't have to tell you anything.

198
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,160
But you could.

199
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,880
You should know better than that.

200
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,440
- Why do you always do this?
- Do what?

201
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,240
You always keep
your feelings boxed up.

202
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,920
You always want to go it alone.

203
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,600
Can't you tell me anything?

204
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,960
Carla, I'm an officer
in the United States Army.

205
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,240
And I'm your family.

206
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,760
Don't do this by yourself.

207
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,240
You shouldn't have come.

208
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,920
Captain!

209
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,920
Oh, come on, Captain!

210
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,040
Give us a break!

211
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,720
<i>What's happened to me?</i>

212
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,080
<i>What's happened to me?</i>

213
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,800
Captain?

214
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,560
What the hell were you thinking?

215
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,600
What kind of virus does this?

216
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,560
You keep me locked up in a room

217
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,040
that wouldn't qualify
for a cheap motel

218
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,400
stick two goons on my ass
day and night.

219
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,520
And I'm on video so much
I could have my own website.

220
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,680
- We did it for your own good.
- My own good?

221
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,760
- Don't I get a say?
- Hell, no.

222
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,960
- You're a soldier.
- Yes, sir, I am.

223
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,960
But what happened
in Sovetskoe happened to me.

224
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,080
I think you owe me.

225
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,400
Owe you? Owe you what?

226
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,240
The truth.

227
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,760
You may not like what you hear.

228
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,960
You're looking
at the only-known photograph

229
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,280
of Peter Irfan.

230
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,760
Orphaned when he was only four.

231
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,480
Raised in a series
of desolate state institutions.

232
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,880
Recognized early
as possessing a genius IQ

233
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,200
with a particular aptitude
for science.

234
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,720
Educated in Belgrade,
the Soviet Union, East Germany.

235
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,680
Then about 15 years ago

236
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,680
when the Wall came down,
he disappeared.

237
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,480
Now, since then,
we believe he's become part

238
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,160
of a global criminal enterprise

239
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,000
with tentacles reaching
into everything

240
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:28,320
from legitimate businesses
to governmental organizations.

241
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:38,960
Black market nuclear technology,
international arms dealers, fraud

242
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,720
commodities manipulations

243
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,560
a network of financing
social entropies so complex...

244
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,320
Their activities appeared
to have only been directed

245
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,840
at maximizing profit.

246
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,400
But there's new disturbing evidence

247
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,800
that a more vicious strategy
has emerged.

248
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,880
An intricate web of science
and technology directed

249
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,680
toward some unknown goal
we can't yet define.

250
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,640
Now, Irfan's specialty
is biochemistry

251
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,960
psychotropic drugs, bioweapons.

252
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,120
We have evidence the operation
in Sovetskoe was just a front

253
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,640
for one of his experiments.

254
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:30,840
The question is,
an experiment for what?

255
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,240
- Why wasn't I told this before?
- Nothing to tell.

256
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,080
Your mission, your intel.

257
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:42,480
It gave us nothing to indicate
that Sovetskoe was Irfan's op.

258
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,640
What makes you think it was?

259
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:49,440
Every bioweapon has a marker, Jane.
A genetic fingerprint.

260
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,240
Whatever you were exposed to
has those markers.

261
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,200
You've seen it before, it's like
a signature. Irfan's signature.

262
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,120
Then you know what I'm infected with?

263
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,440
Dr. Knight helped us rule out
what it's not.

264
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,200
But it's clear that Irfan
is working on something new.

265
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,080
More virulent than you've ever seen.

266
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:09,960
Sir, I request immediate reassignment
to whatever unit is going after him.

267
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,280
I'm afraid that's not possible, Jane.

268
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:15,000
You've been transferred, Alaska,
to a more secure facility.

269
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,080
At least until we find out
what you've been exposed to.

270
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:21,080
This man is responsible for the death
of my entire team.

271
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,640
He's responsible
for what happened to me.

272
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,800
I wanna go after him. I have a right.

273
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,200
I'm sorry, Jane.

274
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,920
Not anymore.

275
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,320
Captain?

276
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,240
I wanted you to know that I...

277
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,640
I requested permission
to continue working on your case

278
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,800
but...

279
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,240
it was denied.

280
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:40,240
I'm sorry I couldn't be more helpful.

281
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,280
Anyway, friends?

282
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,160
Sure.

283
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,560
Captain.

284
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,880
<i>Dr. Collins to radiology.</i>

285
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,360
<i>Dr. Collins to radiology, please.</i>

286
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,760
- Sergeant?
- Yes, ma'am?

287
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:50,800
Patek Philippe, Chronoswiss,
the IWC Portugieser.

288
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,840
Believe me, you're not gonna have
any trouble moving them.

289
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,240
So, are we cool?

290
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,440
Yeah, I'm happy.

291
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,640
All right.

292
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,520
Nice doing business with you.

293
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,920
Yeah.

294
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,360
Get off.

295
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,600
I said get off.

296
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,360
Last chance.

297
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,680
Lady, I think your last chance
is with me.

298
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,040
You better be good.

299
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,800
Just don't fall off.

300
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,160
How do you like the trip so far?

301
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,200
Fire your weapon, soldier.

302
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,560
I gave you an order!

303
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,200
It's all right. My place.

304
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,440
You're hit.

305
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,120
I'm fine.

306
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,520
You're a thief.

307
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,560
I like to think of it
as redistributing wealth.

308
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,040
Flashlight.

309
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,400
What the...

310
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,160
A piece of bullet.

311
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:26,680
Nick... Nick.

312
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,080
- Who's this clown?
- His name is Blue.

313
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,600
Like "Code Blue" for emergencies.

314
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,040
You want to let a brother loose now?

315
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,480
- Look, if I could just take my...
- No.

316
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,840
Look, you need a hospital, okay?

317
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,400
I'll be fine in a couple of hours.

318
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,480
In a couple of hours

319
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,680
you'll be hanging
with Tupac and Biggie, all right?

320
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,840
He's pretty good with gunshot wounds.

321
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,320
Not this kind.

322
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,120
- Where are my clothes?
- We had to cut them off.

323
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,120
Sorry.

324
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:08,400
Hotshot, you're carrying
a truckload of meds.

325
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,960
Why don't you just ditch me?

326
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,520
Is that what you would have done?

327
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,720
I didn't ask for any favors.

328
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,200
No, you just put a gun to my head.

329
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,280
- I didn't have a choice.
- Yeah, well, neither did I.

330
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,880
I had a good thing going,
now I've got the Army after me.

331
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,960
All I got to show for it is you.

332
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,720
Nick.

333
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,200
Nick what?

334
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,840
Nick "that's all you need
to know" Nick.

335
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,440
And right now,
I'm the only friend you got.

336
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,760
Dude, I'm telling you.

337
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,040
Look, there's something weird
about her.

338
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,960
- What, like <i>Jerry Springer</i> weird?
- No... no.

339
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,640
See, I'm talking <i>ET</i>, Area 51

340
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:52,080
<i>Brother From Another Planet-</i>
type weird. Look.

341
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,920
All that mess that went down
at the airport

342
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,320
and not one single mention about it
in the news or anything like that?

343
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,680
What does that say to you?
I'll tell you what it says.

344
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,000
It says weird.

345
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,200
Just like her.
I mean, she creeps me out, man.

346
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,240
Yeah, I could tell by the way
you were staring at her

347
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,720
when we cut her clothes off.

348
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,440
See, that was like the...

349
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,480
that was professional.
That's what that was. Professional.

350
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,440
I mean, but she is kind of like
a fine-ass alien, you know?

351
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,520
<i>Garde,</i> sucker.
It's over for you, man.

352
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,200
I see dead people.

353
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,480
It is over.

354
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,960
No way.

355
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,840
Relax, "Kevorkian,"
it was just a scratch.

356
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:43,680
- Look, lady, what I saw was a...
- Maybe you saw too much.

357
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,200
Yeah... yeah.

358
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,560
That's... Definitely.

359
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,920
Hell, now that you mention it

360
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,480
I think it was just like a scratch
or something like that.

361
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,840
No, a paper cut.

362
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,800
Yeah, definitely.

363
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,640
- Who's winning?
- Do you play?

364
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,160
I know the moves, that's about it.

365
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,960
Blue here thinks he's Bobby Fischer.

366
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,600
Yeah, well, against you,
I can be SpongeBob, all right?

367
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,640
Not tonight.

368
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,880
Black rook to F5.

369
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,600
<i>White knight to H5.</i>

370
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,560
<i>Black bishop to F3. Check.</i>

371
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,000
<i>White king to C1.</i>

372
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,280
<i>Rook to A1. Mate.</i>

373
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,200
White loses.

374
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,240
He doesn't know how to use a door?

375
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:47,600
He can get from one end
of this city to the other

376
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,160
without ever seeing the light of day.

377
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,520
I'm talking sewers,
maintenance tunnels

378
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:54,400
gas, electric, phone,
he knows them all.

379
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,360
It's like one big
Super Mario Brothers game

380
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,440
down there to him.

381
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,600
What do we got?

382
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,480
Chinese.

383
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,640
- He got a name?
- "Squeak."

384
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,840
- He got a home?
- Yeah.

385
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,320
Here.

386
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,120
He likes you.

387
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,800
What does he do
when he doesn't like somebody?

388
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,240
He bites.

389
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:33,400
Damn. See, now, that was a seven...

390
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:37,880
No... No, see, that was a five-move.
Combination to mate?

391
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,160
Beginner's luck?

392
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,240
My ass.

393
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:01,960
What, you don't like the food?

394
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:10,440
So, what'd you do to get everybody
so pissed-off at you?

395
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,960
I'd tell you,
but then I'd have to kill you.

396
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,200
Excuse me.

397
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:23,800
I have some stamps to lick.

398
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,200
If you want to help me, just...

399
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:35,480
You can't joke with him like that.
He's a very jumpy dude.

400
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,560
Unlike you?

401
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,400
It helps to stay calm
in my line of work.

402
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,960
"Redistributing the wealth."
Looks like you're good at it.

403
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:46,120
Looks like it.

404
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,960
Let me guess. Nobody ever gets hurt.

405
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,360
Never ever.

406
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,720
So, what happens now?

407
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,120
- With what?
- With you.

408
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,720
I'm gonna find a guy
or let him find me.

409
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:03,080
And then?

410
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,880
I'm gonna ask him some questions.

411
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:07,240
Then I'm gonna kill him.

412
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,920
Are you telling me she's going
after Peter Irfan herself?

413
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:15,920
I'd bet on it.

414
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:19,640
That can't happen.

415
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:24,240
Don, she feels
personally violated here.

416
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:27,360
You can't totally disregard
her psychological state.

417
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,840
I don't care
about her psychological state.

418
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,640
And frankly,
I'm a little concerned that you do.

419
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:33,120
We have a valuable asset
on the loose.

420
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:35,200
We can't let it fall
into the wrong hands.

421
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:40,440
Look, if we can't have her,
no one can.

422
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:42,680
Is that understood?

423
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:01,760
What, you can't sleep either?

424
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,440
There's plenty more
in the fridge if you want.

425
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:21,320
Who taught you how to iron?

426
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,160
Self-taught.

427
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:26,840
It gives me something to do
at 2.00am.

428
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,920
It's also amazing therapy
for insomnia.

429
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,280
Back of the collar first.

430
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,520
In from the edges, then the front.

431
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,240
In from the edges, then the sleeves.

432
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,040
- Back first.
- An expert?

433
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,120
The Army taught me everything I know.

434
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,080
Not anymore.

435
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:46,680
Why don't you look
on the bright side?

436
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:49,480
Now you can open that fluff and fold
you always wanted.

437
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:52,840
That's better.

438
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:58,880
Anything I can do?

439
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:03,560
Yeah. Make sure I don't sleep in.

440
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:12,160
Hey, Nick?

441
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:17,400
Thanks. Thanks for what you've done.

442
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:19,200
Anytime.

443
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:58,080
Yo.

444
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:01,720
What?

445
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:15,720
She's gone?

446
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,040
And that's not all.

447
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,280
The money.

448
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:26,760
"Sorry"?

449
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,960
Dr. Knight's on a consultation.

450
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:15,800
- Consultation?
- Yeah.

451
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:19,800
He goes up to DC all the time.
Government stuff.

452
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:21,800
Any idea when he'll be back?

453
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:24,960
Hard to say.

454
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:28,480
Gee, I really need to talk to him
about my final grade.

455
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:29,960
Any way to reach him?

456
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:34,640
No. I wouldn't know. Sorry.

457
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:37,760
Will you excuse me for one minute?

458
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:16,480
Excuse me.

459
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:20,240
Is that Dr. Graham Knight?

460
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,520
Yeah. That's him.

461
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,840
Graham Knight. Dr. Graham Knight.

462
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,400
Step into the center of the room.

463
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:28,480
Put your hands on your head,
interlock your fingers.

464
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:29,840
Turn around, get on the floor.

465
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:31,760
- Jane?
- The floor!

466
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:37,400
I was hoping you'd find me, Captain.

467
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:38,600
Shut up.

468
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:42,040
Get up, sit on the couch.

469
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,080
Who the hell are you?

470
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:52,960
Lucas Insley, Military Intelligence.

471
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:54,880
- Whose?
- Ours.

472
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:57,680
- Why the cover?
- I'm on a job.

473
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:00,680
- Me?
- Not exactly.

474
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:01,920
I'm tracking a ghost.

475
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:03,160
Peter Irfan?

476
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,760
There is no Peter Irfan.
Peter Irfan doesn't exist.

477
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:08,520
He's a fiction, a camouflage.

478
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:11,480
- For what?
- Not "for what." For who.

479
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:19,200
For your mentor, Jane,
your CO, Colonel Ian Watts.

480
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:29,680
In the late '80s, our government
had an active bioweapons program.

481
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,920
Defensive purposes dedicated
to "what-if" scenarios

482
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,040
and guess who headed it up?

483
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:41,280
The political pressure got too hot.
The program got shut down.

484
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:44,720
And a lot of people
didn't like that decision.

485
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,920
You're saying Watts kept it active?

486
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:50,360
Sub-rosa, off the books.
Totally rogue.

487
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:52,800
And he had a great cover.

488
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:53,880
Peter Irfan.

489
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:55,800
An enemy without a face

490
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,560
who could be blamed
whenever anybody got close

491
00:53:58,640 --> 00:53:59,760
to uncovering his operation.

492
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:04,080
A phantom that could never be caught,
because he didn't exist.

493
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:05,960
But why?

494
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:11,880
We think Watts' operation morphed
into something more ambitious.

495
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:16,120
We think he graduated
to full-scale bioengineering

496
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,640
using sophisticated
gene-splicing technology

497
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:22,240
to alter human capabilities.

498
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:26,760
- You're lying.
- No, it gets better, or worse.

499
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:31,240
Evidently, his subjects
did develop new abilities.

500
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:32,880
Nothing superhuman.

501
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:36,480
They just became more
of what they were.

502
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:38,680
Sound familiar?

503
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:41,360
But there was a flaw.

504
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:45,520
Everyone died,
eaten alive by their own cells.

505
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:48,200
That was before
"Operation Painkiller."

506
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:50,480
That was before you.

507
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:55,720
Sovetskoe was Watts' operation
until you stumbled into it.

508
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:59,400
If it was Watts' operation,
why would he send us in there?

509
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,440
He didn't.
You picked the target, remember?

510
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,840
You made the case so well
with the brass.

511
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:09,160
He couldn't overrule you
without blowback on his motives.

512
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:10,520
He had to let you in.

513
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:13,560
He just had no intention
of ever letting you out.

514
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:14,960
Don't you understand?

515
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:19,760
He betrayed Painkiller.
He betrayed you.

516
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:22,360
And he knows what you are.
You're the one that didn't die.

517
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:25,880
You're the one
that finally can accelerate

518
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:27,400
the evolutionary clock.

519
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:31,520
No wonder he wanted you in Alaska.

520
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:32,880
Get on the floor.

521
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,440
Jane. Jane, please think.

522
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:37,880
Just don't let your emotions
affect your judgment.

523
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:38,960
Do it.

524
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:41,240
Jane.

525
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:44,360
You need someone you can trust.

526
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:45,800
We can work together, Jane.

527
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:47,760
Help me out.

528
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:49,480
I mean, we can take him
down together.

529
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:50,560
And then what?

530
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,600
So you and your buddies
can have a piece of me instead?

531
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:54,880
Jane, I know
this must be hard to take

532
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:58,600
but I can help you. We can help...

533
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:00,280
Captain?

534
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,160
Captain?

535
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:18,320
Mr. Pierce.

536
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:21,240
Got a minute?

537
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:25,000
So, you're saying
you're just a victim in all of this?

538
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:29,120
It was either roll with it or die.
What was I supposed to do?

539
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:34,200
- How long did she stay?
- Twenty-four hours.

540
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,400
Her condition?

541
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:38,360
Seemed fine to me.

542
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:44,200
Is she some kind of spy, terrorist?

543
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:48,440
I'm gonna give you my private number.

544
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:51,160
If you should see her
or hear from her

545
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:53,200
you're gonna give me a call,
won't you?

546
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,200
She's not coming back here.

547
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:02,040
You want to be on my side
on this one, Mr. Pierce.

548
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:04,560
Or?

549
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,720
Use your imagination.

550
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:11,480
It's nice doing business with you.

551
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:46,200
- Hey.
- Hey.

552
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:51,200
You're right. I can't do this alone.

553
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:54,760
Looks like nothing's changed.

554
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:58,840
Except me.

555
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,160
Can I have a look?

556
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Yeah.

557
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:10,160
- You said this happened when?
- Three days ago.

558
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:13,720
Unbelievable, right?

559
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,960
All I can say is,
I wish you were lying.

560
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,480
It would be funny
if it weren't so damn scary.

561
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:20,280
Why didn't you tell me
about this before?

562
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,480
I didn't wanna get you involved.

563
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,280
I was afraid
it would be too dangerous.

564
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,280
I'm sorry.

565
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:29,240
Yeah, I see things, Carla.

566
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:33,720
Letters jumping off pages,
people appearing and disappearing.

567
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,280
It's like the world
is this big jigsaw puzzle

568
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:37,680
that's been blown apart.

569
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:41,720
When it comes back together,
everything's different, new.

570
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:46,040
Maybe your brain is doing
what your body is doing.

571
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:50,080
Making connections faster,
doing more than normal.

572
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:53,360
It's gonna kill me, isn't it?

573
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:55,040
Well, no. I didn't say that.

574
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:58,120
But I need to get you
into a proper testing facility.

575
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:01,120
Carla, the second I go above ground,
they'll turn me into a lab rat.

576
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:02,400
Jane, I'm your sister.

577
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,560
They're not gonna get
their hands on you.

578
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:09,560
No. That's exactly
what we're gonna do.

579
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:11,120
What?

580
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:16,360
Let them get their hands on me.
And you're gonna help.

581
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:55,320
Business is booming, huh?

582
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:57,160
How the hell did you get in here?

583
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:59,800
- Nice hair.
- Oh, this place is nothing compared

584
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:01,400
to some of the places
I've gotten into.

585
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:02,600
Where's my money?

586
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:03,880
I've got a way you can earn it back.

587
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:05,880
You want me to work for my own money?

588
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:08,440
Well, strictly speaking.
It's not really yours, is it?

589
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:12,560
Hey, I trusted you,
and what did I get? Ripped off.

590
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:14,360
You know, why don't you
just come out and say

591
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:15,680
what's really on your mind?

592
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:20,880
Just say, "I need your help, Nick."

593
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:22,680
Come on, it's easy.

594
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:29,360
I need your help, Nick.

595
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:32,480
What do you need?

596
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:39,280
So, what happens now?

597
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:53,320
Are you certain it's Dr. Knight?

598
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:55,880
Sir, it's Browning's sister.

599
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:57,240
She said she won't talk
to anyone but you.

600
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,400
I'll get back to you.

601
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:02,560
- Watts here.
<i>- My sister wants to turn herself in.</i>

602
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:07,320
<i>Leave the building alone.
Take the I-95 into Baltimore.</i>

603
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:12,280
<i>Exit East Eden Boulevard.
Take a right on Fern, across Third.</i>

604
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:14,440
<i>There's an alley on your right.</i>

605
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:30,880
He's at the location. Stand by.

606
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:17,280
Negative. We've got nothing.

607
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:18,560
You're standing right next to him.

608
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:42,800
Climb.

609
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:08,760
Welcome to Oz, Colonel.

610
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:26,760
Have a seat.
The party will be joining you soon.

611
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:32,640
Oh, and by the way,
get "Moe" and "Curly" off my street.

612
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:34,320
They're affecting property values.

613
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:53,040
- You okay?
- Yeah, fine.

614
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:54,400
- You trashed his phone?
- Yeah.

615
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:55,880
Was he armed?

616
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:06,880
Something to remember me by.

617
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:11,880
You want me to stick around?
I'll watch your back.

618
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:13,040
No, thanks.

619
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:15,600
Look, it's none of my business...

620
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,040
You're right.
It's none of your business.

621
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:19,560
Your job's over, Nick. Thank you.

622
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:24,800
Okay, hotshot. Your deal.

623
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:47,160
I hardly recognize you.

624
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:51,880
This is an unusual choice
for a meeting.

625
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:54,400
I figured you wouldn't want
to try anything too messy

626
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:56,080
with hundreds of witnesses around.

627
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:57,720
I'm on your side, Jane.

628
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:58,800
What side is that?

629
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,440
I can't help what happened.

630
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:03,320
All I can do is promise
to protect you.

631
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:04,960
Like you did in Sovetskoe?

632
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:15,200
What's the matter, Colonel?
You seem a bit nervous.

633
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:17,280
Jane, look.

634
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:19,720
If there's anything I could have done
to prevent what happened, so...

635
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:21,480
Oh, let's cut the crap!

636
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:25,000
- It's between you and me now.
- What are you talking about?

637
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:27,760
They know Sovetskoe
was your operation.

638
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:29,760
- "They"?
- Military Intelligence.

639
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:31,080
Captain Lucas Insley.

640
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:33,520
- Who?
- Insley, Lucas. A Captain.

641
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:35,440
Never heard of him.

642
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:37,320
But you've heard of Graham Knight,
haven't you?

643
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:44,960
Is this his idea?
Did he set up this meeting?

644
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:22,160
Jane, I have never lied to you,
and I'm not going to begin to now.

645
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:26,520
The real Graham Knight is dead.

646
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:30,080
My men found him with his throat cut
in a shack in the Florida Keys.

647
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:32,160
I found that out an hour ago.

648
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:33,240
Don't you get it?

649
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:36,840
Knight is Irfan.

650
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:38,280
Knight is Irfan.

651
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:41,240
He's playing us, Jane.
You, me, all of us!

652
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:42,920
He's using you to get to me.

653
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:46,600
Once I'm out of the picture,
he's got you all to himself.

654
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:12,880
Stand back! Stand back! Get down!

655
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:38,160
Nick! Nick! Over here!

656
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:39,720
I'm going for the shooter!

657
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:43,960
Move! Move, move! Get out of the way!

658
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:00,400
Jane?

659
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,680
You need me. Remember?

660
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:07,000
I wanna know what this thing is
that you gave me.

661
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:09,480
Oh, the question
you should be asking yourself is

662
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:10,840
what is it that you gave me?

663
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:16,800
- What is that?
- It's you.

664
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:19,520
You gave it to me at Wilkins.

665
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:22,400
- My blood?
- No, more than that.

666
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:29,360
Remarkable.

667
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:32,520
You have about three seconds
to start making sense.

668
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:35,640
Ever since our little encounter
in Sovetskoe

669
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:39,080
everyone's been trying to figure out
what did the virus do to you

670
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:42,680
when all I want to know
is what did you do to the virus?

671
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:45,640
Now I know.

672
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:50,680
You've helped me jump
a million years in biology.

673
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:53,640
You're the next step
in human evolution.

674
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:56,680
You're the new Eve.

675
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:58,400
You're insane.

676
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:02,240
Well, I think in time,
you'll change your mind.

677
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:22,320
I couldn't possibly leave you
to fools like Watts.

678
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:28,000
How could they possibly know
what to do with someone

679
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:29,600
as unique as you, Jane?

680
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:39,080
Why should we be satisfied
with who we are?

681
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:42,280
Why should we be limited
by the random acts

682
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:45,240
of biology that created us?

683
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:48,320
I think we should be more
than who we are.

684
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:51,040
I mean, what if we could change,
you know?

685
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:53,080
We could change everything?

686
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:56,560
The point of life is not to just be.

687
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:58,240
It's to become.

688
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:01,200
Grey!

689
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:39,720
This is gonna hurt.

690
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:03,560
A shame.

691
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:07,240
Just think of what
we could've done with her.

692
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:09,560
She didn't wanna be used that way.

693
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:13,440
Well, she won't be used
by anyone now.

694
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:52,080
As a matter of public record,
she died from wounds suffered

695
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:54,760
while trying to escape transfer
from Wilkins.

696
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:58,440
That incident at the mall
never really happened.

697
01:13:58,520 --> 01:13:59,520
Is that clear?

698
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:02,240
Clear.

699
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:04,280
Good.

700
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:06,680
I need a few moments alone.

701
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:12,960
That sound okay with you?

702
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:26,280
A new name, new history.

703
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:30,160
Birth certificate, driver's license,
Social Security card.

704
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:33,320
All current and all clean.

705
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:37,320
And you were left this boat
by an uncle

706
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:39,520
and he left you some money.

707
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:43,920
Thank you.

708
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:45,920
Oh, we'll figure out
how to pay me back later.

709
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:49,600
We never found that vial
or the shooter.

710
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:53,640
No, it's at the bottom
of the Potomac...

711
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:55,880
with Irfan.

712
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:23,560
I need a drink.

713
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:25,480
You're buying, right?

714
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,320
Let's go, Pipsqueak.

715
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:44,760
What is it?

716
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:50,040
It's a scarab beetle. Egyptian.

717
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:53,680
It represents rebirth.

718
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:57,280
So...

719
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:01,480
one big happy family.

720
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:06,200
Yeah.

721
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:21,200
Gentlemen.

722
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:31,360
We're ready to begin.
