00:00:11,288 --> 00:00:13,873
(smooth music)

2
00:00:22,446 --> 00:00:25,116
(birds singing)

3
00:00:32,077 --> 00:00:34,829
(playful music)

4
00:02:57,902 --> 00:03:00,655
(phone ringing)

5
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:04,425
- [Isaac] Hi, this is Isaac,
you know how this works.

6
00:03:04,426 --> 00:03:06,567
Leave your name and a short
phone number at the tone,

7
00:03:06,568 --> 00:03:07,943
I'll get right back to you.

8
00:03:07,944 --> 00:03:09,305
(phone beeps)

9
00:03:09,306 --> 00:03:11,670
- [Tracy] Hi, Isaac, this is Tracy.

10
00:03:11,671 --> 00:03:13,875
I know it's been too long, I'm sorry.

11
00:03:13,876 --> 00:03:17,276
Look, this is ridiculously
short notice, what else is new?

12
00:03:17,277 --> 00:03:21,280
This weekend, my parents'
place, just like old times.

13
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:22,797
Can you come up?

14
00:03:22,798 --> 00:03:24,163
I hope I hear from you.

15
00:03:24,164 --> 00:03:26,522
Can't wait to see you, bye.

16
00:03:26,523 --> 00:03:29,109

(he whistles)

50
00:07:03,177 --> 00:07:04,011
- Shut up.

51
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:07,037
- No, you shut up.

52
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:08,639
- No you shut up.
- Oh yeah?

53
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,474
- Yeah.

54
00:07:11,586 --> 00:07:14,336
(they laugh)

55
00:07:14,337 --> 00:07:16,089
Oh, oh you look good.

56
00:07:17,367 --> 00:07:18,727
- Thanks.

57
00:07:18,728 --> 00:07:21,189
You look great.
- Thanks.

58
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,587
Hey, you've got a gray hair.

59
00:07:22,588 --> 00:07:23,788
- No!
- Yes, you do!

60
00:07:23,789 --> 00:07:25,830
- Ah!
- See, look.

61
00:07:25,831 --> 00:07:27,856
- Well, at least it was
still hanging in there.

62
00:07:27,857 --> 00:07:28,977
Wait a minute.

63
00:07:28,978 --> 00:07:29,976
You're turning gray yourself!

64
00:07:29,977 --> 00:07:31,039
- No.
- Yeah, a little

65
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,139
bit right there, look!

66
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:35,060
- Come on, I want you to meet Neal.

67
00:07:37,227 --> 00:07:38,242
Honey, did you get something?

68
00:07:38,243 --> 00:07:39,704
- Well, I was trying for a squirrel,

69
00:07:39,705 --> 00:07:41,966
but I really don't know the
right way to prepare 'em.

70
00:07:41,967 --> 00:07:43,691
- I think you just yell,
Look out, I'm gonna shoot.

71
00:07:43,692 --> 00:07:45,752
(they laugh)

72
00:07:45,753 --> 00:07:46,755
- You must be Isaac.

73
00:07:46,756 --> 00:07:48,353
Hi, Neal Kennedy.
- Hi, Neal.

74
00:07:48,354 --> 00:07:49,457
- Isaac, I hope you don't mind,

75
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:50,775
but I told Neal you'd play him

76
00:07:50,776 --> 00:07:52,097
some of your stuff this weekend.

77
00:07:52,098 --> 00:07:53,218
- What stuff?

78
00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:54,145
- Well, I remember some songs

79
00:07:54,146 --> 00:07:55,746
I think would be great for the next album.

80
00:07:55,747 --> 00:07:57,385
- [Isaac] You have got a hell of a memory.

81
00:07:57,386 --> 00:07:58,401
- I'd love to hear him.

82
00:07:58,402 --> 00:07:59,430
- All right, I gotta warn you,

83
00:07:59,431 --> 00:08:00,566
they're all about 12 years old.

84
00:08:00,567 --> 00:08:03,412
- Oh, that's all right, so
are most of Tracy's fans.

85
00:08:03,413 --> 00:08:05,212
We'll talk a little more after dinner.

86
00:08:05,213 --> 00:08:06,892
Speaking of which, I'd better get going.

87
00:08:06,893 --> 00:08:10,977
Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, Neal.

88
00:08:10,978 --> 00:08:12,239
Wow.

89
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,917
Cooks, he hunts, he dresses well.

90
00:08:14,918 --> 00:08:16,020
Is there anything he doesn't do?

91
00:08:16,021 --> 00:08:18,046
- Macrame, but I'm working on it.

92
00:08:18,047 --> 00:08:19,370
(Isaac laughs)

93
00:08:19,371 --> 00:08:20,905
- You know, I just read a
great article about you.

94
00:08:20,906 --> 00:08:22,093
Where was that?

95
00:08:22,094 --> 00:08:23,429
- [Tracy] Ah, well there was the cover

96
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,831
of Stone and Newsweek-
- No, no, no, no.

97
00:08:24,832 --> 00:08:27,710
It was that thing about
the alien space diet

98
00:08:27,711 --> 00:08:30,357
that you and Big Foot's
love child came up with.

99
00:08:30,358 --> 00:08:32,380
- [Tracy] Yeah, another excellent article.

100
00:08:32,381 --> 00:08:33,400
- [Isaac] Pithy.

101
00:08:33,401 --> 00:08:34,702
(Tracy laughs)

102
00:08:34,703 --> 00:08:36,405
- The last album was a snap.

103
00:08:36,406 --> 00:08:39,081
The critics were polite and
it's selling by the truckload.

104
00:08:39,082 --> 00:08:41,232
It's the next one, the
one after the gold record

105
00:08:41,233 --> 00:08:42,671
that's the bitch.

106
00:08:42,672 --> 00:08:44,769
- Hun?
- Ah, that's parsley, hun.

107
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:45,774
I need basil.

108
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,556
- So what exactly do you do, Neal?

109
00:08:48,557 --> 00:08:50,777
- Well, officially I'm Tracy's manager,

110
00:08:50,778 --> 00:08:54,238
but I guess you could also
call me her producer, mentor,

111
00:08:54,239 --> 00:08:55,982
father confessor-
- Sage?

112
00:08:55,983 --> 00:08:57,104
- Oh, I wouldn't go that far.

113
00:08:57,105 --> 00:08:58,645
- No silly, sage.

114
00:08:58,646 --> 00:09:00,403
Could use this instead of basil.

115
00:09:00,404 --> 00:09:02,492
- Well, yeah, a pinch.

116
00:09:02,493 --> 00:09:04,231
I'll also need four hard boiled eggs.

117
00:09:04,232 --> 00:09:05,932
- Hard boiled eggs coming up.

118
00:09:05,933 --> 00:09:08,434
- So what do you do when you're
not writing songs, Isaac?

119
00:09:08,435 --> 00:09:09,996
- Well, that's most of the time.

120
00:09:09,997 --> 00:09:12,959
Actually, I'm a newspaper writer.

121
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,108
I'm the music critic.
- Another critic, uh-oh.

122
00:09:17,109 --> 00:09:19,404
- So how'd you review my album?

123
00:09:19,405 --> 00:09:21,112
- I think I'm too close to be objective.

124
00:09:21,113 --> 00:09:23,071
- Hey, nothing wrong with a bias press.

125
00:09:23,072 --> 00:09:24,912
As long as it's in our favor.

126
00:09:24,913 --> 00:09:26,569
Listen, you decide you
ever want to go national,

127
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:29,376
I know a couple of guys at
Rolling Stone who owe me favors.

128
00:09:29,377 --> 00:09:31,282
- Well thanks, Neal.
- What's keeping those eggs?

129
00:09:31,283 --> 00:09:33,204
- I can't remember which
ones I hard-boiled.

130
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:34,918
- Tracy.
- Well, I forgot.

131
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:36,785
- Anyway, I think it's
great that there's at least

132
00:09:36,786 --> 00:09:38,905
one critic out there with
a background in music.

133
00:09:38,906 --> 00:09:40,629
- Here, watch this.

134
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:44,692
Hard boiled eggs spin,
uncooked ones don't.

135
00:09:44,693 --> 00:09:46,669
I used to be the food critic.

136
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:47,503
(car horn beeping)

137
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:48,973
- Oh, they're here.

138
00:09:48,974 --> 00:09:50,965
Two more places.

139
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:53,640
- I didn't realize Tracy invited
anybody else this weekend.

140
00:09:53,641 --> 00:09:54,905
I mean, besides me.

141
00:09:54,906 --> 00:09:57,324
Oh, and you of course.
- Didn't she tell you?

142
00:09:57,325 --> 00:09:58,930
She invited the whole band.
- What band?

143
00:09:58,931 --> 00:09:59,942
- Your band?
- My band?

144
00:09:59,943 --> 00:10:01,926
- Well, Bob's band.

145
00:10:01,927 --> 00:10:04,665
(they scream and laugh)

146
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:07,033
- Oh, it's so good to see you!

147
00:10:07,034 --> 00:10:08,513
How was the drive up?
- Great.

148
00:10:08,514 --> 00:10:10,014
I cut my best time by 40 minutes.

149
00:10:10,015 --> 00:10:12,219
- Yeah, Augie still insists
that nationally imposed

150
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,558
speed limits are unconstitutional.

151
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:14,620
- Yeah.

152
00:10:14,621 --> 00:10:16,618
- Hey, Thomas Jefferson
would've screamed his ass off.

153
00:10:16,619 --> 00:10:18,305
- Yeah, I remember the Fargo road trip.

154
00:10:18,306 --> 00:10:20,787
You tried that same argument
with the highway patrol.

155
00:10:20,788 --> 00:10:23,303
- And he wouldn't let
us go above (mumbles).

156
00:10:23,304 --> 00:10:24,707
- That was Bob's moaning phase.

157
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,625
Do you remember when he
repositioned the telescope

158
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,707
in the astronomy department?

159
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:31,652
- I'll give them a lunar
eclipse they'll never forget.

160
00:10:31,653 --> 00:10:33,253
Or something like that, right?

161
00:10:33,254 --> 00:10:34,973
- That's pretty close.

162
00:10:34,974 --> 00:10:36,554
- Who's the dick in the apron?

163
00:10:36,555 --> 00:10:38,017
- Everyone, this is Neal Kennedy,

164
00:10:38,018 --> 00:10:40,015
Neal, this is Augie Glass,

165
00:10:40,016 --> 00:10:41,658
one of the world's greatest drummers.

166
00:10:41,659 --> 00:10:43,422
- One of the world's greatest
undiscovered drummers.

167
00:10:43,423 --> 00:10:44,422
(they laugh)

168
00:10:44,423 --> 00:10:46,489
- And Kris Sherwood,
photographer extraordinaire.

169
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:48,731
- Currently road manager extraordinaire.

170
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:52,449
At least until Augie can
find somebody full time.

171
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:53,712
(they laugh)

172
00:10:53,713 --> 00:10:56,856
- Well, this is so great
having everyone here.

173
00:10:56,857 --> 00:10:59,255
- Aren't we missing somebody?

174
00:10:59,256 --> 00:11:00,519
There's another woman, right?

175
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,302
- Oh right, Ginny.

176
00:11:02,303 --> 00:11:03,762
- You tracked down Ginny?

177
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:05,324
God, I thought she dropped
off the face of the Earth.

178
00:11:05,325 --> 00:11:07,322
- No, no, no, I found
her album, remember this?

179
00:11:07,323 --> 00:11:08,157
- Oh, no!

180
00:11:09,188 --> 00:11:11,671
- God's believers still
sending her residuals.

181
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:13,154
- Look at her hair!
- Oh, Neal,

182
00:11:13,155 --> 00:11:15,355
remember what I said about
watching your language around-

183
00:11:15,356 --> 00:11:17,037
- Oh, Jesus, that's right.

184
00:11:17,038 --> 00:11:18,659
No swearing around the Minister's dogs.

185
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,086
I suppose you're gonna
lock up the liquor too.

186
00:11:21,087 --> 00:11:24,004
- On the contrary, what
can I get everybody?

187
00:11:24,005 --> 00:11:25,749
- Did you tell your parents
we're coming this weekend,

188
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,747
or did you lie?

189
00:11:26,748 --> 00:11:27,763
(they laugh)

190
00:11:27,764 --> 00:11:30,154
- God, they used to scream at me.

191
00:11:30,155 --> 00:11:31,254
Who made this mess?

192
00:11:31,255 --> 00:11:32,796
Who drank all the liquor?

193
00:11:32,797 --> 00:11:34,958
Who put the lawn furniture up on the roof?

194
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,256
(they laugh)

195
00:11:36,257 --> 00:11:38,221
- Bob did it.
- Bob did it!

196
00:11:38,222 --> 00:11:39,843
- That's what I always said.

197
00:11:39,844 --> 00:11:40,928
- Actually...

198
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:44,422
Actually, I persuaded
Tracy to buy the house

199
00:11:44,423 --> 00:11:46,687
from her parents as an investment.

200
00:11:46,688 --> 00:11:47,851
Now they lease it back from her

201
00:11:47,852 --> 00:11:49,453
for a couple of weeks every summer.

202
00:11:49,454 --> 00:11:51,826
- But you give them a
break on the rent, right?

203
00:11:51,827 --> 00:11:53,258
- No.

204
00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:56,084
- I wanted to, but Neal says I can't.

205
00:11:56,085 --> 00:11:57,086
Tax reasons.

206
00:11:58,024 --> 00:11:59,644
Neal's a wizard with money.

207
00:11:59,645 --> 00:12:01,113
- Especially other people's money.

208
00:12:01,114 --> 00:12:04,251
(he chuckles)

209
00:12:04,252 --> 00:12:07,255
(smooth rock music)

210
00:12:08,716 --> 00:12:11,698
(car engine revs)

211
00:12:11,699 --> 00:12:13,381
(wheels screeching)

212
00:12:13,382 --> 00:12:15,202
- Remember when I told you
I'd have a house like this

213
00:12:15,203 --> 00:12:16,941
by the time I was 30?

214
00:12:16,942 --> 00:12:17,776
- Yeah.

215
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:22,784
- Guess I'm running a little late.

216
00:12:26,734 --> 00:12:28,495
So, does this weekend thing involve food,

217
00:12:28,496 --> 00:12:29,957
or are we on our own, or?

218
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,756
- Well, dinner's almost ready.

219
00:12:31,757 --> 00:12:33,961
We're just waiting for-

220
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:35,462
Ginny?

221
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,746
- Oh, there you are!

222
00:12:37,747 --> 00:12:41,418
Jesus, what the hell
happened to all of you?

223
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:44,132
So, after I broke up with that jerk,

224
00:12:44,133 --> 00:12:47,892
I got involved in this
pro-nuclear anti-abortion thing.

225
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:49,812
No, wait, reverse that.

226
00:12:50,816 --> 00:12:53,880
And I moved in with this
woman, a lesbian it turns out,

227
00:12:53,881 --> 00:12:55,882
and we had been going for a while,

228
00:12:55,883 --> 00:12:58,866
but it just didn't work out.

229
00:12:58,867 --> 00:13:02,849
She's a vegetarian, I
just can't get into that.

230
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:05,307
God made cows to eat, you know?

231
00:13:05,308 --> 00:13:06,954
Every living thing that moves on earth

232
00:13:06,955 --> 00:13:09,218
shall be food for you, Genesis 9:3.

233
00:13:09,219 --> 00:13:11,304
So, I hit the road again.

234
00:13:14,862 --> 00:13:15,696
- Neal?

235
00:13:17,265 --> 00:13:20,227
Neal, honey, could you give
me a hand in the kitchen?

236
00:13:20,228 --> 00:13:22,480
- Oh yeah, sure, excuse us.

237
00:13:28,854 --> 00:13:31,000
Talk about your lost sheep.

238
00:13:31,001 --> 00:13:34,334
- Oh, Neal, I wish you
could have met her before.

239
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,978
She used to be so, well, just so-

240
00:13:36,979 --> 00:13:38,540
- Well, that's the record biz.

241
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:40,376
It does change people.

242
00:13:41,504 --> 00:13:43,327
- Anyway, so there we were,

243
00:13:43,328 --> 00:13:45,990
20 days outside of Nepal,

244
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:49,232
and all of a sudden, out of the blue,

245
00:13:49,233 --> 00:13:52,296
comes this little man in a robe.

246
00:13:52,297 --> 00:13:54,738
Turns out he's a monk.

247
00:13:54,739 --> 00:13:57,042
The locals call him the Shama Lama.

248
00:13:57,043 --> 00:13:58,377
- The Shama Lama?
- Uh-huh.

249
00:13:58,378 --> 00:13:59,482
- Shama lama ding dong.

250
00:13:59,483 --> 00:14:02,269
He was big back in the fifties.

251
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,343
- Would you be quiet a minute?

252
00:14:03,344 --> 00:14:04,367
- Who, me or her?

253
00:14:04,368 --> 00:14:05,370
- Both of you.

254
00:14:05,371 --> 00:14:06,769
Listen, I've been thinking,

255
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:08,792
why do you suppose Tracy called
us all back together again

256
00:14:08,793 --> 00:14:10,628
after all these years?

257
00:14:12,038 --> 00:14:13,289
Think about it.

258
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,459
- She's planning to kill us one by one.

259
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,725
(he laughs maniacally)

260
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:21,685
- Look around, we're all here.

261
00:14:21,686 --> 00:14:24,691
Drums, backup vocals, keyboards.

262
00:14:24,692 --> 00:14:25,689
I'll bet she's planning on putting

263
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:27,531
the band back together again.

264
00:14:27,532 --> 00:14:28,716
- I don't understand.

265
00:14:28,717 --> 00:14:31,359
Why would she want to kill us then?

266
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,879
- Ginny, come on.

267
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,982
That guy Neal is a record
producer and her manager.

268
00:14:35,983 --> 00:14:37,461
Now, if you had Tracy's money and clout,

269
00:14:37,462 --> 00:14:39,666
would you want to work with your friends?

270
00:14:39,667 --> 00:14:41,188
- But what makes Tracy think
we'd just drop everything

271
00:14:41,189 --> 00:14:43,451
and run off with her?

272
00:14:43,452 --> 00:14:45,050
I mean, I would, of course.

273
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:46,105
- I don't think I'm ready to get back

274
00:14:46,106 --> 00:14:47,387
into that kind of grind.

275
00:14:47,388 --> 00:14:48,710
- Well, of course you are, Ginny.

276
00:14:48,711 --> 00:14:51,214
It'll be great for Augie too.

277
00:14:51,215 --> 00:14:54,198
- Yeah, maybe, but I like what I'm doing.

278
00:14:54,199 --> 00:14:55,842
- You like driving
hundreds of miles a day,

279
00:14:55,843 --> 00:14:57,262
living on cold, greasy takeout food,

280
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:58,303
sleeping in filthy motels

281
00:14:58,304 --> 00:15:00,566
and playing to a bunch of
drunken backwater yokels?

282
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:02,605
- Oh sure, just talk
about the negative stuff.

283
00:15:02,606 --> 00:15:03,607
- All right.

284
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,493
Here we are.

285
00:15:06,494 --> 00:15:09,114
Now, as a special after dinner treat,

286
00:15:09,115 --> 00:15:11,256
I've brought out one of my favorites.

287
00:15:11,257 --> 00:15:14,222
This is a delightful Venezuelan liquor.

288
00:15:14,223 --> 00:15:16,044
Believe me, after a
long day in the jungles,

289
00:15:16,045 --> 00:15:18,083
there's nothing finer.

290
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,988
- Yeah, those Venezuelans
really know how to live.

291
00:15:19,989 --> 00:15:21,703
(they laugh)

292
00:15:21,704 --> 00:15:25,194
- Well, this is so great
having you all here at once.

293
00:15:25,195 --> 00:15:29,054
I'd like to propose a
toast to old friends.

294
00:15:29,055 --> 00:15:31,307
- Hear, hear.
- Hear, hear.

295
00:15:39,963 --> 00:15:44,587
- I was gonna save this till
later, but I just can't wait.

296
00:15:44,588 --> 00:15:46,271
There's a special reason why I asked

297
00:15:46,272 --> 00:15:48,691
you all up here this weekend.

298
00:15:49,619 --> 00:15:52,640
Neal, do you want to tell
them or should I, or?

299
00:15:52,641 --> 00:15:55,502
- Oh no, I think it would
mean more coming from you.

300
00:15:55,503 --> 00:15:58,089
- Isaac, Ginny, Augie and Kris.

301
00:16:00,286 --> 00:16:04,252
I've known you all since,
well for a long time.

302
00:16:04,253 --> 00:16:06,473
And you are all so dear to me,

303
00:16:06,474 --> 00:16:09,958
it would give me and Neal great pleasure

304
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:13,138
if on Sunday you would be our witnesses

305
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,808
as we exchange our wedding vows.

306
00:16:17,323 --> 00:16:18,623
- Marriage kind of wedding vows?

307
00:16:18,624 --> 00:16:19,625
- Just like.

308
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:28,419
(gentle piano music)

309
00:16:29,414 --> 00:16:32,317
So I figured if word of the
wedding were to leak out

310
00:16:32,318 --> 00:16:35,563
to all those supermarket
scandal sheets, you know,

311
00:16:35,564 --> 00:16:37,885
they'd swarm up here and
just ruin everything.

312
00:16:37,886 --> 00:16:40,384
- It is a bitch being famous.

313
00:16:40,385 --> 00:16:41,606
Well, it has been for me.

314
00:16:41,607 --> 00:16:42,850
(they laugh)

315
00:16:42,851 --> 00:16:43,848
- Sorry.

316
00:16:43,849 --> 00:16:45,232
So when are you guys getting married?

317
00:16:45,233 --> 00:16:47,310
- Oh.
- I sound like your Mother!

318
00:16:47,311 --> 00:16:49,713
- No, I think my Mother's given up on me.

319
00:16:49,714 --> 00:16:51,718
I told her at this point, if
she wants Augie in the family,

320
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,480
she'd be better off adopting him.

321
00:16:53,481 --> 00:16:54,478
(she laughs)

322
00:16:54,479 --> 00:16:56,741
- So, it's really just a question
of targeting the audience.

323
00:16:56,742 --> 00:16:58,183
Those little buggers
don't have much money,

324
00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:59,187
but what they do have,

325
00:16:59,188 --> 00:17:02,609
they spend on CDs, tapes
and records, God bless 'em.

326
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:03,784
- How do you like the record?

327
00:17:03,785 --> 00:17:05,513
- Oh, it's selling very well.

328
00:17:05,514 --> 00:17:06,773
- No, he means the music.

329
00:17:06,774 --> 00:17:08,316
How'd you like the music?

330
00:17:08,317 --> 00:17:10,035
- I'm not the target audience.

331
00:17:10,036 --> 00:17:12,656
Hey hun, why don't we show them the video?

332
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:14,482
Oh, granted, they're a
little out of the A train,

333
00:17:14,483 --> 00:17:16,105
but they still might get a kick out of it.

334
00:17:16,106 --> 00:17:18,561
- You guys don't want
to see my video, do you?

335
00:17:18,562 --> 00:17:19,927
- No.

336
00:17:19,928 --> 00:17:22,833
(they laugh)

337
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:24,929
- Oh, sure they do.

338
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:26,099
I directed it.

339
00:17:27,251 --> 00:17:30,337
Okay, this is Better Late Than Never.

340
00:17:31,577 --> 00:17:33,452
Our next platinum single.

341
00:17:33,453 --> 00:17:35,122
(they clap)

342
00:17:35,123 --> 00:17:38,209
(upbeat piano music)

343
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:45,430
♪ Women seem to go for me ♪

344
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:48,735
♪ And when I ask 'em why ♪

345
00:17:48,736 --> 00:17:51,855
♪ The thing they always tell me is ♪

346
00:17:51,856 --> 00:17:54,834
♪ You're such a nice guy ♪

347
00:17:54,835 --> 00:17:57,720
♪ You're not too strong
and you're not too smart ♪

348
00:17:57,721 --> 00:18:01,046
♪ My looks don't make 'em sigh ♪

349
00:18:01,047 --> 00:18:02,043
- Oops.

350
00:18:02,044 --> 00:18:04,046
Sorry, Neal, wrong tape.

351
00:18:05,347 --> 00:18:07,452
I got to label these things.

352
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:10,192
- Don't tell me that's the legendary Bob.

353
00:18:10,193 --> 00:18:11,861
- That's Bob.
- Huh.

354
00:18:13,081 --> 00:18:14,579
That's kind of a disappointment.

355
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,802
I mean, after the big buildup,

356
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:19,368
I really don't see what
all the fuss is about.

357
00:18:19,369 --> 00:18:21,806
- You had to be there.
- Ah, here we go, here we go.

358
00:18:21,807 --> 00:18:24,712
Okay, remember now, you folks
are seeing this weeks ahead

359
00:18:24,713 --> 00:18:26,293
of the MTV show.

360
00:18:26,294 --> 00:18:28,452
- I don't think we're
worthy of such an honor.

361
00:18:28,453 --> 00:18:31,456
- Oh you, get back in here, come on.

362
00:18:32,724 --> 00:18:37,729
♪ And say a prayer ♪

363
00:18:39,484 --> 00:18:44,489
♪ To whomever whatever
is watching up there ♪

364
00:19:02,037 --> 00:19:02,870
Shut up.

365
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,959
- No, you shut up.
- No, you shut up.

366
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,379
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

367
00:19:10,765 --> 00:19:13,404
You still miss him, don't you?

368
00:19:13,405 --> 00:19:14,728
- Don't you?

369
00:19:14,729 --> 00:19:15,563
- Yeah.

370
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,308
Yeah, I do.

371
00:19:23,299 --> 00:19:24,996
Do you think it's different to be in love

372
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:28,834
in your thirties than
it was in your twenties?

373
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:31,686
- It's the same for me.

374
00:19:31,687 --> 00:19:33,165
- Ooh!

375
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:34,809
Are you in love?

376
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:35,824
- [Isaac] No.

377
00:19:35,825 --> 00:19:37,911
(she laughs)

378
00:19:37,912 --> 00:19:39,155
- You know what you are?

379
00:19:39,156 --> 00:19:40,154
- An idiot?

380
00:19:40,155 --> 00:19:41,696
- No.

381
00:19:41,697 --> 00:19:46,101
You are living proof that all
the best men are not taken.

382
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:50,106
- Well, maybe that's
because the best women are.

383
00:19:52,785 --> 00:19:55,091
- Are you currently recording with anyone?

384
00:19:55,092 --> 00:19:57,026
- Haven't for years.

385
00:19:57,027 --> 00:19:58,611
- Oh, we should talk about that.

386
00:19:58,612 --> 00:20:00,947
- Crap, crap, garbage, crap.

387
00:20:04,861 --> 00:20:06,393
- Look at Tracy.

388
00:20:06,394 --> 00:20:08,097
My God, she languished for years,

389
00:20:08,098 --> 00:20:11,909
what with bad material,
bad management, bad hair.

390
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,927
You know, I turned her entire
career around with one album,

391
00:20:14,928 --> 00:20:17,637
or actually to tell the
truth, with one single,

392
00:20:17,638 --> 00:20:20,357
off an otherwise (mumbles) album.

393
00:20:20,358 --> 00:20:21,942
- Crap, crap, crap.

394
00:20:25,988 --> 00:20:29,369
- I don't know, I just started
to get control of my life.

395
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:30,628
- Oh, don't worry about that.

396
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:32,464
That's what I do best.

397
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,109
- So out.

398
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,741
- I don't know, it's, Neal's kind of,

399
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:43,562
it's hard to explain.

400
00:20:43,563 --> 00:20:46,445
You know, I think, I think
he's like Bob would have been,

401
00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:48,406
if he'd had a chance to grow up.

402
00:20:48,407 --> 00:20:49,568
- Yeah?

403
00:20:49,569 --> 00:20:53,945
Well, growing up's not
all it's cracked up to be.

404
00:20:53,946 --> 00:20:57,035
- So, you're not writing songs, huh?

405
00:20:57,036 --> 00:20:58,287
- No, not much.

406
00:21:00,001 --> 00:21:02,043
Oh, well that's not true.

407
00:21:02,044 --> 00:21:03,763
Not at all.

408
00:21:03,764 --> 00:21:05,067
- Well, how come?
- I don't know.

409
00:21:05,068 --> 00:21:07,309
- [Tracy] You're so good.

410
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:09,812
- I lack inspiration, I guess.

411
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:15,007
- Ah, Tracy, I am going to
how you say, hit the hay.

412
00:21:17,362 --> 00:21:21,082
I do not suppose you
would care to join me?

413
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,179
- Sure, hun.

414
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:25,188
Your room's all set, I'll
see you in the morning.

415
00:21:25,189 --> 00:21:26,023
- Thanks.

416
00:21:26,971 --> 00:21:27,889
Good night.

417
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:36,720
(wind chime tinkling)

418
00:21:50,092 --> 00:21:53,178
(upbeat piano music)

419
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,681
- Hey, join in any time.

420
00:23:05,082 --> 00:23:08,087
(Isaac screams)

421
00:23:08,088 --> 00:23:09,339
- Bob?
- Isaac.

422
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:12,183
- Bob?
- Isaac.

423
00:23:13,553 --> 00:23:15,215
- Bob?
- Isaac,

424
00:23:15,216 --> 00:23:17,140
this is getting boring.

425
00:23:17,141 --> 00:23:18,218
- What are you doing here?

426
00:23:18,219 --> 00:23:19,238
- I'll tell you what I'm doing here

427
00:23:19,239 --> 00:23:22,062
if you tell me why we're whispering.

428
00:23:22,063 --> 00:23:23,066
(Isaac stuttering)

429
00:23:23,067 --> 00:23:24,923
Come on, say the D word.

430
00:23:24,924 --> 00:23:27,769
- Dead?
- Ya-hah, I sure am!

431
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:29,509
Doesn't mean you have to whisper on me.

432
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:31,511
Come on, loosen up.

433
00:23:31,512 --> 00:23:32,792
(he cheers)

434
00:23:32,793 --> 00:23:34,816
It's Friday night, we got no more classes,

435
00:23:34,817 --> 00:23:36,519
let's party our asses!

436
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,676
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

437
00:23:37,677 --> 00:23:39,141
The others are sleeping.

438
00:23:39,142 --> 00:23:40,681
- Well, they can't hear me.

439
00:23:40,682 --> 00:23:43,465
You can't hear me, can you?

440
00:23:43,466 --> 00:23:44,463
See.

441
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:46,166
You're an educated man,
you should know this.

442
00:23:46,167 --> 00:23:48,908
Only you can see me, only you can hear me.

443
00:23:48,909 --> 00:23:50,869
Aren't you lucky?

444
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:52,914
- Is this a dream?
- Well, I'm flattered

445
00:23:52,915 --> 00:23:56,075
you consider dreaming about
me, but no, you're awake,

446
00:23:56,076 --> 00:23:58,178
I'm dead, deal with it.

447
00:23:58,179 --> 00:24:00,463
- What are you doing here?

448
00:24:00,464 --> 00:24:03,485
- I am the undead, I come
from beyond the grave

449
00:24:03,486 --> 00:24:05,486
to claim that which is mine.

450
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:08,711
- Oh my God!
- I'm kidding, I'm kidding!

451
00:24:08,712 --> 00:24:09,546
Whew.

452
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:13,830
You look terrible, let's get you a drink.

453
00:24:15,098 --> 00:24:17,600
(tense music)

454
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:37,220
Tracy's folks always hid the good stuff.

455
00:24:37,221 --> 00:24:40,341
I'd join you, but since I
am no longer of the flesh,

456
00:24:40,342 --> 00:24:43,762
this stuff will all wind up on the floor.

457
00:24:44,887 --> 00:24:46,806
Go ahead, have a snort.

458
00:24:48,448 --> 00:24:50,950
(tense music)

459
00:24:56,819 --> 00:24:59,519
If you say Bob one more
time, I'll smack you.

460
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,354
- Sorry.

461
00:25:01,565 --> 00:25:03,462
I am having a little
trouble handling this.

462
00:25:03,463 --> 00:25:05,488
I don't believe in ghosts.

463
00:25:05,489 --> 00:25:06,905
- Hey, me neither.

464
00:25:06,906 --> 00:25:08,848
So, how have you been?

465
00:25:08,849 --> 00:25:09,933
- Me?
- Yeah.

466
00:25:10,934 --> 00:25:13,790
I'm dead, things are pretty
much the same with me.

467
00:25:13,791 --> 00:25:14,789
How about you?

468
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,358
Are you happy?

469
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:17,634
- Am I happy you're dead?

470
00:25:17,635 --> 00:25:20,061
- [Bob] No, dummy, are
you happy with your life?

471
00:25:20,062 --> 00:25:21,504
- What if I say no?

472
00:25:21,505 --> 00:25:22,502
- Relax, will you?

473
00:25:22,503 --> 00:25:25,344
I'm visiting, I'm not recruiting.

474
00:25:25,345 --> 00:25:28,391
Wait, wait, wait, who is this bozo?

475
00:25:28,392 --> 00:25:31,891
- [Isaac] He's her manager,
producer, Svengali.

476
00:25:31,892 --> 00:25:34,397
- Tracy's marrying an Italian guy?

477
00:25:34,398 --> 00:25:36,655
Well, when did the two of you break up?

478
00:25:36,656 --> 00:25:37,936
- Us?

479
00:25:37,937 --> 00:25:39,799
We never dated.

480
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,245
- Get out of here, you
used to be so hot for her!

481
00:25:42,246 --> 00:25:43,778
- I was not.
- Yes, you were!

482
00:25:43,779 --> 00:25:44,782
- No, I wasn't!

483
00:25:44,783 --> 00:25:48,491
- Don't argue with me, I know
where your ancestors are.

484
00:25:48,492 --> 00:25:49,569
Now come on, tell me the truth.

485
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:51,829
When Tracy and I were going hot and heavy,

486
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:52,829
in the back of your mind,

487
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:54,273
wasn't a little voice saying,

488
00:25:54,274 --> 00:25:57,119
Gee, I wish something
would happen to Bob.

489
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,500
- Don't be ridiculous.

490
00:25:58,501 --> 00:25:59,499
- If Bob was out of the way,

491
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,821
Tracy would surely fall for me.

492
00:26:01,822 --> 00:26:04,704
Come on, am I right?
- Bob, you're my best friend.

493
00:26:04,705 --> 00:26:07,209
- And you're my best friend,
don't change the subject.

494
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:08,828
Come on, am I right?

495
00:26:08,829 --> 00:26:10,947
- All right, yeah.

496
00:26:10,948 --> 00:26:14,496
Yes, I have to admit it,
the thought crossed my mind.

497
00:26:14,497 --> 00:26:15,494
Once.

498
00:26:15,495 --> 00:26:16,814
- Bull.
- Maybe twice.

499
00:26:16,815 --> 00:26:18,377
- Double bull!
- All right, all right,

500
00:26:18,378 --> 00:26:19,381
I wanted you out of the way!

501
00:26:19,382 --> 00:26:23,636
- Well you got your wish,
schmuck, and you blew it.

502
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:29,231
Jeez, you step out for 10 years
and everything goes to hell.

503
00:26:29,232 --> 00:26:31,430
- You know, speaking of hell-

504
00:26:31,431 --> 00:26:32,994
- Watch it.
- No, no, no, no.

505
00:26:32,995 --> 00:26:35,754
I was just wondering if you, well,

506
00:26:35,755 --> 00:26:37,257
if you went, or...

507
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,259
- Thanks a lot!
- What do you mean?

508
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:44,547
You made it to heaven?

509
00:26:44,548 --> 00:26:47,686
- Well, actually I was
as surprised as you are.

510
00:26:47,687 --> 00:26:48,951
You know, the weird thing is,

511
00:26:48,952 --> 00:26:50,350
it doesn't matter how good you were.

512
00:26:50,351 --> 00:26:51,754
It's all based on your SATs.

513
00:26:51,755 --> 00:26:53,192
(Isaac laughs)

514
00:26:53,193 --> 00:26:54,192
- Get out of here.

515
00:26:54,193 --> 00:26:55,614
- You have to understand how it's set up.

516
00:26:55,615 --> 00:26:57,494
I mean, it's not like up in the clouds

517
00:26:57,495 --> 00:26:58,497
or anything like that.

518
00:26:58,498 --> 00:26:59,821
It's here.

519
00:26:59,822 --> 00:27:02,544
It's right here, all around us.

520
00:27:02,545 --> 00:27:03,963
You just can't see it.

521
00:27:03,964 --> 00:27:08,347
- You mean, you mean like a
parallel dimension or something?

522
00:27:08,348 --> 00:27:10,600
- Yeah, kind of, only more.

523
00:27:11,932 --> 00:27:15,895
Whatever existed on
Earth, exists in heaven.

524
00:27:15,896 --> 00:27:19,681
This house, that lake,
our old grade school.

525
00:27:19,682 --> 00:27:21,160
- Our school burned down.

526
00:27:21,161 --> 00:27:22,585
- It's still in heaven.
- Well, they built

527
00:27:22,586 --> 00:27:23,765
a shopping center over it.

528
00:27:23,766 --> 00:27:26,445
- That's there too.
- How?

529
00:27:26,446 --> 00:27:28,788
- I don't know how, it just is.

530
00:27:28,789 --> 00:27:31,063
Hell, Einstein is there,
even he can't explain it.

531
00:27:31,064 --> 00:27:32,068
- Einstein?

532
00:27:32,069 --> 00:27:33,332
You've met him?

533
00:27:33,333 --> 00:27:34,833
- Everybody is there.

534
00:27:34,834 --> 00:27:38,318
All the people you read
about, it's a mindblower.

535
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:39,987
- What about Hitler?

536
00:27:43,103 --> 00:27:45,584
You mean there isn't any hell?

537
00:27:45,585 --> 00:27:48,644
- Yeah, sure, but it's in heaven.

538
00:27:48,645 --> 00:27:52,092
- I don't follow you.
- Look, look, in heaven,

539
00:27:52,093 --> 00:27:55,578
you can do anything you
want to do, anything.

540
00:27:55,579 --> 00:27:56,838
And right now in heaven,

541
00:27:56,839 --> 00:27:58,861
there are about 30 million people

542
00:27:58,862 --> 00:28:02,382
who want nothing more than to
kick Hitler right in the nuts.

543
00:28:02,383 --> 00:28:03,922
I mean, you want to know what hell is?

544
00:28:03,923 --> 00:28:05,844
It's being kicked in the
nuts 30 million times

545
00:28:05,845 --> 00:28:07,430
a day for eternity.

546
00:28:09,845 --> 00:28:12,431
(gentle music)

547
00:28:16,357 --> 00:28:17,677
Does she miss me?

548
00:28:17,678 --> 00:28:20,723
I mean, does she ever mention me?

549
00:28:20,724 --> 00:28:23,221
- I thought you guys could
listen to that sort of stuff.

550
00:28:23,222 --> 00:28:25,807
- Oh, sure, and we do at first.

551
00:28:26,945 --> 00:28:28,368
And then as time goes on,

552
00:28:28,369 --> 00:28:32,029
you tune in every once in a while.

553
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:33,376
And if you don't hear
your name being mentioned,

554
00:28:33,377 --> 00:28:34,897
you begin to wonder.

555
00:28:34,898 --> 00:28:36,877
- Yeah, well, don't worry about it.

556
00:28:36,878 --> 00:28:38,720
We all miss you.

557
00:28:38,721 --> 00:28:40,196
Everybody still talks about you.

558
00:28:40,197 --> 00:28:44,040
I mean, that is about
all we've done all night.

559
00:28:44,041 --> 00:28:46,408
- How long has it been since
you've all been together?

560
00:28:46,409 --> 00:28:47,449
- [Isaac] I don't know.

561
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:49,785
Eight, 10 years.
- 10 years?

562
00:28:51,134 --> 00:28:53,375
Either I'm dead or my watch has stopped.

563
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:57,251
- You know, Tracy should
not be marrying that guy.

564
00:28:57,252 --> 00:29:01,417
He's, I don't know,
he's not right for her.

565
00:29:01,418 --> 00:29:02,919
- Oh, and you are?

566
00:29:05,446 --> 00:29:07,506
Tracy likes you.

567
00:29:07,507 --> 00:29:08,510
She thought it was real cute

568
00:29:08,511 --> 00:29:09,892
the way you wrote that song for her.

569
00:29:09,893 --> 00:29:12,796
What was the name of that stupid thing?

570
00:29:12,797 --> 00:29:14,574
- The last song that I wrote for you.

571
00:29:14,575 --> 00:29:16,939
(he laughs)

572
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:21,883
♪ You cannot rush these things along ♪

573
00:29:21,884 --> 00:29:24,947
♪ You know it would be wrong ♪

574
00:29:24,948 --> 00:29:28,202
♪ Two microwave a song ♪

575
00:29:29,849 --> 00:29:31,829
You should have told her how you felt.

576
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:33,332
- Now you tell me.

577
00:29:34,853 --> 00:29:37,335
And what would she say?

578
00:29:37,336 --> 00:29:38,170
- Isaac?

579
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,314
Isaac?

580
00:29:41,984 --> 00:29:43,841
Hey, are you up?

581
00:29:43,842 --> 00:29:44,676
- Oh, God.

582
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:48,404
Ooh, I had the strangest dream last night.

583
00:29:48,405 --> 00:29:51,129
- Really, that's wild, so did I.

584
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:53,092
What was yours about?

585
00:29:53,093 --> 00:29:54,812
- It's about a quarter scotch, I think.

586
00:29:54,813 --> 00:29:55,815
- Right.

587
00:29:55,816 --> 00:29:57,198
You're the last one up, get in the shower,

588
00:29:57,199 --> 00:29:59,201
I got a big day planned.

589
00:30:02,122 --> 00:30:05,208
(bright piano music)

590
00:30:08,688 --> 00:30:10,689
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

591
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:11,991
(Isaac shouts)

592
00:30:11,992 --> 00:30:13,273
- Are you all right in there?

593
00:30:13,274 --> 00:30:16,277
- Yeah, the water suddenly got cold.

594
00:30:17,118 --> 00:30:20,454
- Well, last one up gets the cold water.

595
00:30:21,581 --> 00:30:23,763
- Oh my God, it wasn't a dream.

596
00:30:23,764 --> 00:30:25,543
- Sure it was, and this is a wet dream.

597
00:30:25,544 --> 00:30:28,004
Listen, I got a great idea.

598
00:30:28,005 --> 00:30:30,169
- That is the stupidest
idea I've ever heard.

599
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:32,130
- Oh look, you know
you should marry Tracy,

600
00:30:32,131 --> 00:30:33,828
and I know you should marry Tracy.

601
00:30:33,829 --> 00:30:36,038
All we got to do now is convince Tracy.

602
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:38,216
- Oh, the day before her wedding?

603
00:30:38,217 --> 00:30:40,395
- Hey, is it my fault you took 10 years

604
00:30:40,396 --> 00:30:41,691
to get off your butt?

605
00:30:41,692 --> 00:30:44,162
- Do you think Tracy ought
to have a say in all this?

606
00:30:44,163 --> 00:30:46,784
- Ah, it's out of her hands.

607
00:30:46,785 --> 00:30:49,048
This is divine intervention.

608
00:30:49,049 --> 00:30:50,883
Now put on your pants.

609
00:30:55,594 --> 00:30:56,936
- Why did you spin the egg?

610
00:30:56,937 --> 00:30:58,374
- To see if it was hard-boiled or not.

611
00:30:58,375 --> 00:30:59,712
Little trick I developed.

612
00:30:59,713 --> 00:31:00,899
(the girls giggle)

613
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,897
- What are you guys doing?

614
00:31:01,898 --> 00:31:04,279
- Neal's teaching us how
to make hollandaise sauce.

615
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,817
- It doesn't have raisins in it, does it?

616
00:31:05,818 --> 00:31:08,123
- Hollandaise, good God, no.

617
00:31:08,124 --> 00:31:10,283
- Good, raisins make me fart.

618
00:31:10,284 --> 00:31:11,347
- Ew.

619
00:31:11,348 --> 00:31:13,471
- Anybody still hungry?

620
00:31:13,472 --> 00:31:14,689
- Morning, everyone.

621
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:16,115
- Hey, Isaac.
- Hey.

622
00:31:16,116 --> 00:31:17,910
- Wow, what happened to your aura?

623
00:31:17,911 --> 00:31:19,377
- My aura?
- Yeah.

624
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:21,400
My spiritualist said I'm
the best energy spotter

625
00:31:21,401 --> 00:31:23,759
he'd ever seen, ever.

626
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,285
And I've been picking up some
mighty powerful vibrations

627
00:31:26,286 --> 00:31:28,720
ever since I got here.

628
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:31,684
- Does anybody else
notice anything unusual

629
00:31:31,685 --> 00:31:34,188
about me or my immediate aura?

630
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:38,938
- You look hung over.
- Thanks, Kris.

631
00:31:39,936 --> 00:31:41,660
- Wait a hot second, that's Ginny.

632
00:31:41,661 --> 00:31:43,742
- Mm-hmm.
- Talk about raising

633
00:31:43,743 --> 00:31:44,827
the dead, wa!

634
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:50,605
- Pulp?
- Freshly squeezed.

635
00:31:50,606 --> 00:31:51,440
- Okay.

636
00:31:52,328 --> 00:31:55,490
- Hey, how's it coming?
- Ah, well, you can't rush

637
00:31:55,491 --> 00:31:59,412
perfection, as you learnt
last night, mon cher.

638
00:32:00,496 --> 00:32:01,931
- So that's the dickhead, huh?

639
00:32:01,932 --> 00:32:02,998
- Yeah.
- What?

640
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,501
- Oh, I just said yep, you
can not rush perfection.

641
00:32:06,502 --> 00:32:08,466
- Come here, you little froggie delight.

642
00:32:08,467 --> 00:32:11,404
(they giggle)

643
00:32:11,405 --> 00:32:12,573
- Oh, come on!

644
00:32:13,489 --> 00:32:16,052
Ever seen a ghost throw up?

645
00:32:16,053 --> 00:32:17,653
I'll bet this clown buttons his pajamas

646
00:32:17,654 --> 00:32:19,906
all the way up to the neck.

647
00:32:21,055 --> 00:32:23,483
(blender whirring)

648
00:32:23,484 --> 00:32:24,336
- Sweetie, sweetie.
- Oh, sorry.

649
00:32:24,337 --> 00:32:25,171
- Careful.

650
00:32:26,157 --> 00:32:27,282
Honey, what did you do?

651
00:32:27,283 --> 00:32:28,117
Ah!

652
00:32:28,964 --> 00:32:30,299
Oh, oh, sweetie!

653
00:32:31,185 --> 00:32:33,928
Oh, oh, it's all over everything.

654
00:32:33,929 --> 00:32:36,453
Oh!
- House is possessed.

655
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:37,713
Quick, call the police.

656
00:32:37,714 --> 00:32:39,795
- Look at me, I'm soaked!

657
00:32:39,796 --> 00:32:40,951
- Oh, it's no big deal all right!

658
00:32:40,952 --> 00:32:42,897
Change your shirt.

659
00:32:42,898 --> 00:32:44,381
Hey, you guys will never
guess what I have planned

660
00:32:44,382 --> 00:32:46,383
for later today.
- Oh, let me guess.

661
00:32:46,384 --> 00:32:48,224
We're gonna eviscerate your fiance.

662
00:32:48,225 --> 00:32:49,405
- God, what's eviscerate mean?

663
00:32:49,406 --> 00:32:52,325
- To disembowel, take out the entrails.

664
00:32:52,326 --> 00:32:53,160
Why?

665
00:32:54,328 --> 00:32:58,332
- Oh, I was just working
on some lyrics, before.

666
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:02,373
Is there coffee?

667
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,698
- Isaac, you seem kinda hazy this morning.

668
00:33:05,699 --> 00:33:08,438
- Yeah, yeah, sometimes
takes me a while to wake up.

669
00:33:08,439 --> 00:33:09,765
- You should meditate.

670
00:33:09,766 --> 00:33:11,768
I got up at five and
did three hours worth.

671
00:33:11,769 --> 00:33:13,626
I like to meditate in the nude.

672
00:33:13,627 --> 00:33:15,346
- Why the hell wasn't I in
her shower this morning?

673
00:33:15,347 --> 00:33:16,392
- It works great.

674
00:33:16,393 --> 00:33:18,831
Sometimes I levitate.

675
00:33:18,832 --> 00:33:21,757
- Oh bullshit, I can't even do that.

676
00:33:21,758 --> 00:33:24,101
- So what exactly did you
have planned for this morning?

677
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:25,921
- Oh, you'll never guess.
- Roller skating.

678
00:33:25,922 --> 00:33:28,041
- Roller skating?

679
00:33:28,042 --> 00:33:31,228
- That's incredible,
how did you know that?

680
00:33:31,229 --> 00:33:33,627
- Oh... (he chuckles)

681
00:33:33,628 --> 00:33:35,713
Little dead bird told me.

682
00:33:36,935 --> 00:33:38,873
- Wow, well, we'll go right after we eat,

683
00:33:38,874 --> 00:33:39,993
I've got it all planned.

684
00:33:39,994 --> 00:33:42,914
Oh, this is gonna be fun, trust me.

685
00:33:43,775 --> 00:33:46,361
(upbeat music)

686
00:33:48,324 --> 00:33:51,264
- Okay, okay, have you
got any without pompoms?

687
00:33:51,265 --> 00:33:52,381
(she laughs)

688
00:33:52,382 --> 00:33:54,430
- So, Ginny, do you like to skate?

689
00:33:54,431 --> 00:33:56,773
- Spent six months in the roller derby.

690
00:33:56,774 --> 00:34:00,309
- Seven and a half please,
narrow if you've got it.

691
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:01,530
Thank you.
- I take a size

692
00:34:01,531 --> 00:34:03,799
10 and a half over hammer
boot with Sims wheels

693
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,321
and Faulkner bearings.

694
00:34:05,322 --> 00:34:06,874
- Huh?

695
00:34:06,875 --> 00:34:08,127
- Over hammers.

696
00:34:09,107 --> 00:34:11,407
- Sorry, son, we only have skates here.

697
00:34:11,408 --> 00:34:13,809
- No, no, it's a type of skate.

698
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:15,895
- What is?
- Over hammers.

699
00:34:22,278 --> 00:34:24,098
- We're out.

700
00:34:24,099 --> 00:34:25,218
- Oh, that's it, I can't skate

701
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:26,862
if they don't have over hammers, sorry.

702
00:34:26,863 --> 00:34:28,763
- Oh, come on, you're
holding everybody up,

703
00:34:28,764 --> 00:34:30,405
don't be a wet blanket.

704
00:34:30,406 --> 00:34:32,607
- Come on, don't be a spoil sport.

705
00:34:32,608 --> 00:34:33,706
- Stick in the mud.

706
00:34:33,707 --> 00:34:36,973
- Troublemaker.
- Pain in the ass.

707
00:34:36,974 --> 00:34:38,271
- All right, all right.

708
00:34:38,272 --> 00:34:40,257
Anything in a 10 and a half.

709
00:34:40,258 --> 00:34:42,137
- Yes, this is gonna be so much fun!

710
00:34:42,138 --> 00:34:43,258
- Keep reminding me.

711
00:34:43,259 --> 00:34:45,257
Nine and a half.

712
00:34:45,258 --> 00:34:46,092
Thanks.

713
00:34:47,161 --> 00:34:49,584
- Size five, please.

714
00:34:49,585 --> 00:34:54,590
- Skating rink without over
hammers, I don't believe it.

715
00:34:54,688 --> 00:34:56,440
- Make that an eight.

716
00:34:58,154 --> 00:35:00,739
(upbeat music)

717
00:35:19,193 --> 00:35:20,516
- Aug?

718
00:35:20,517 --> 00:35:22,193
Aug, you're gonna wanna-

719
00:35:22,194 --> 00:35:23,028
Aug?

720
00:35:24,201 --> 00:35:25,369
Lace those up.

721
00:35:27,063 --> 00:35:28,662
- God, I haven't done
this since I was a kid,

722
00:35:28,663 --> 00:35:30,787
I hope I don't look like
a complete fool out there.

723
00:35:30,788 --> 00:35:33,624
- Not with me out there you won't.

724
00:35:40,414 --> 00:35:41,774
- Isn't this fun?

725
00:35:41,775 --> 00:35:43,277
- Oh, you know it.

726
00:35:45,742 --> 00:35:48,328
(upbeat music)

727
00:36:18,132 --> 00:36:18,965
- Help me!

728
00:36:21,298 --> 00:36:23,217
- Woo, yes, conga line!

729
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:38,455
- Poetry in motion.

730
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:41,978
Really bad poetry.

731
00:36:41,979 --> 00:36:44,717
- Don't just stand there,
Casper, give me a hand.

732
00:36:44,718 --> 00:36:47,360
- I'd love to, but
you're living, I'm dead,

733
00:36:47,361 --> 00:36:50,147
I lack substance.
- So what else is new?

734
00:36:50,148 --> 00:36:51,807
- Smart ass.

735
00:36:51,808 --> 00:36:53,868
I can't, it's a rule.

736
00:36:53,869 --> 00:36:55,470
- A rule?

737
00:36:55,471 --> 00:36:57,152
Who made it up?

738
00:36:57,153 --> 00:36:58,353
- Well, let me put it this way.

739
00:36:58,354 --> 00:37:00,573
It wasn't a committee decision.

740
00:37:00,574 --> 00:37:02,378
Oh, I can touch inanimate things,

741
00:37:02,379 --> 00:37:04,801
chains, creaky doors, blenders,

742
00:37:04,802 --> 00:37:06,916
all that standard ghost crap.

743
00:37:06,917 --> 00:37:09,378
I'm just not allowed to touch people.

744
00:37:09,379 --> 00:37:10,785
- Why?

745
00:37:10,786 --> 00:37:12,905
What happens if you touch a person?

746
00:37:12,906 --> 00:37:14,267
- They don't say.

747
00:37:14,268 --> 00:37:16,528
They don't have to say.

748
00:37:16,529 --> 00:37:19,152
- Okay, well, how did you know Tracy

749
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:20,792
was gonna bring us here?

750
00:37:20,793 --> 00:37:23,658
- I planted the suggestion
in her dream last night.

751
00:37:23,659 --> 00:37:24,699
- Wow, you can do that?

752
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,716
- Hey man, I'm supernatural,

753
00:37:25,717 --> 00:37:28,081
I can do lots of unexplainable things.

754
00:37:28,082 --> 00:37:30,886
Look, you've got a coin in your ear.

755
00:37:30,887 --> 00:37:33,086
Woo, now, think of a card.

756
00:37:33,087 --> 00:37:34,469
- Cut that out.

757
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:37,848
- No, really, it was an
incredibly romantic dream.

758
00:37:37,849 --> 00:37:41,878
The two of you, gliding
along, hand in hand,

759
00:37:41,879 --> 00:37:43,616
you spin to a stop,

760
00:37:43,617 --> 00:37:46,055
the world around you's a blur.

761
00:37:46,056 --> 00:37:49,886
You look into each other's
eyes, and you kiss.

762
00:37:49,887 --> 00:37:51,056
Fabulous kiss.

763
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:54,910
You should have been there.

764
00:37:54,911 --> 00:37:55,745
- Yeah.

765
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:58,834
No.

766
00:37:58,835 --> 00:38:01,296
No, this is never going to work.

767
00:38:01,297 --> 00:38:03,100
I've got two days to
win her over from a guy

768
00:38:03,101 --> 00:38:04,797
that she's been seeing for over two years?

769
00:38:04,798 --> 00:38:06,319
- You have history together,

770
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,524
you just never had the guts
to follow through on it.

771
00:38:08,525 --> 00:38:10,403
First we have to get Neal out of the way,

772
00:38:10,404 --> 00:38:14,406
then you step in and well, kismet we hope.

773
00:38:14,407 --> 00:38:15,493
- I don't believe in kismet.

774
00:38:15,494 --> 00:38:16,969
- Well, you don't believe in ghosts,

775
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:20,557
so you'd better look
who you're talking to.

776
00:38:21,439 --> 00:38:24,025
(upbeat music)

777
00:38:29,826 --> 00:38:32,329
Can you believe this guy?

778
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:34,470
He should be wearing a
big, flashing neon sign

779
00:38:34,471 --> 00:38:36,746
that says I'm a dickhead.

780
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:38,048
- Can you get those?

781
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:39,574
- Come on, Isaac, it's easy!

782
00:38:39,575 --> 00:38:41,976
Don't be such a wallflower.

783
00:38:41,977 --> 00:38:44,563
(Isaac laughs)

784
00:38:45,621 --> 00:38:48,207
- Help me!
- Use your stop, Aug!

785
00:38:50,047 --> 00:38:52,049
- The wall is good, too.

786
00:38:53,327 --> 00:38:55,912
(upbeat music)

787
00:39:11,927 --> 00:39:14,513
(Kris screams)

788
00:39:17,053 --> 00:39:19,028
- Come on, I'll give you a lesson.

789
00:39:19,029 --> 00:39:21,034
- Oh great, how to be a dickhead 101.

790
00:39:21,035 --> 00:39:22,235
- It's easy.

791
00:39:22,236 --> 00:39:23,735
I taught Tracy everything she knows,

792
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:25,488
look how she's doing.

793
00:39:27,841 --> 00:39:29,177
- [Isaac] Well, hell, I
can do that all right.

794
00:39:29,178 --> 00:39:30,679
- Get out of here.

795
00:39:33,885 --> 00:39:36,068
Well, you girls look like
you're getting the hang of it.

796
00:39:36,069 --> 00:39:37,472
- I think I'm gonna throw up.

797
00:39:37,473 --> 00:39:39,330
- Does anybody wanna play pack and whip?

798
00:39:39,331 --> 00:39:40,415
- Great idea.

799
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:45,554
Come on, here we go.

800
00:39:45,555 --> 00:39:48,891
(they shout and scream)

801
00:39:56,305 --> 00:39:58,974
(Tracy screams)

802
00:40:00,967 --> 00:40:02,332
- Isn't this fun?

803
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:04,088
- Fun, I don't know, let's
get a second opinion.

804
00:40:04,089 --> 00:40:05,257
Aug, look out!

805
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:09,323
(Tracy laughs)

806
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,041
- How am I doing so far?

807
00:40:13,042 --> 00:40:14,819
- The wall's still beating
you, two to nothing.

808
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:17,644
(Tracy laughs)

809
00:40:17,645 --> 00:40:19,948
- [Augie] Neal sure likes
the girls, doesn't he?

810
00:40:19,949 --> 00:40:22,170
- Oh yeah, he's such a flirt.

811
00:40:22,171 --> 00:40:24,691
I guess it's something
I'll have to get used to.

812
00:40:24,692 --> 00:40:26,516
Or kill him.

813
00:40:26,517 --> 00:40:27,525
(Isaac laughs)

814
00:40:27,526 --> 00:40:28,859
You know, I dreamt about this last night,

815
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:31,081
and it was a lot more romantic.

816
00:40:31,082 --> 00:40:32,666
And not so painful.

817
00:40:33,603 --> 00:40:36,344
- How was I doing in your dream?

818
00:40:36,345 --> 00:40:40,016
- Well, you know how
exaggerated dreams get.

819
00:40:41,651 --> 00:40:42,649
- Don't take them down in the rink,

820
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:44,485
someone will get hurt.

821
00:40:45,753 --> 00:40:48,339
(upbeat music)

822
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:04,992
(Neal shouts)

823
00:41:06,098 --> 00:41:08,355
- Ow!
- That's gotta hurt.

824
00:41:08,356 --> 00:41:09,774
- Author, author!

825
00:41:11,121 --> 00:41:12,119
(they clap and whistle)

826
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,539
- Now that's a great trick.

827
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:14,540
- Ah!
- Oh,

828
00:41:14,541 --> 00:41:16,144
I think he's really hurt.

829
00:41:16,145 --> 00:41:17,484
(Neal groans)

830
00:41:17,485 --> 00:41:20,751
(the women shout)

831
00:41:20,752 --> 00:41:22,254
- Careful, ow, ow!

832
00:41:23,374 --> 00:41:26,012
No, no, God no, just stay away from me!

833
00:41:26,013 --> 00:41:28,951
(they shout and groan)

834
00:41:28,952 --> 00:41:31,178
- Oh, I saw that coming.

835
00:41:31,179 --> 00:41:33,804
- Oh, oh this is not working.

836
00:41:33,805 --> 00:41:36,143
I'm gonna have to take
this home and wrap it.

837
00:41:36,144 --> 00:41:38,326
Only trouble is, I
don't think I can drive.

838
00:41:38,327 --> 00:41:39,728
This is my shifting arm.

839
00:41:39,729 --> 00:41:41,186
- To go with the shifty eyes.

840
00:41:41,187 --> 00:41:43,211
- Can anybody here drive an MG?

841
00:41:43,212 --> 00:41:44,229
- I can.

842
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:45,773
Come on, I'll get you
there in record time.

843
00:41:45,774 --> 00:41:47,215
- We could take you in Isaac's car.

844
00:41:47,216 --> 00:41:48,315
- No.
- No.

845
00:41:48,316 --> 00:41:49,555
- No?
- No.

846
00:41:49,556 --> 00:41:51,535
I mean, I've paid for two hours,

847
00:41:51,536 --> 00:41:53,381
you might as well get my money's worth.

848
00:41:53,382 --> 00:41:54,883
- Well, okay, bye.

849
00:42:01,812 --> 00:42:04,130
- You know, you probably
wouldn't have fallen

850
00:42:04,131 --> 00:42:06,800
if you was wearing over hammers.

851
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,261
- We'd better go too, kid.

852
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:12,664
Come on, we gotta set up.

853
00:42:12,665 --> 00:42:14,102
Right, we'll see you guys tonight.

854
00:42:14,103 --> 00:42:15,104
- Okay, bye.

855
00:42:16,187 --> 00:42:19,029
Well, looks like it's
just you and me, fella.

856
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:22,116
- This is it, say something romantic.

857
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:26,295
- Are you sweating as much as I am?

858
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:32,300
♪ You said that I meant
everything in this world ♪

859
00:42:32,301 --> 00:42:33,624

00:42:55,924 --> 00:42:57,745
- Where are the guys?

868
00:42:57,746 --> 00:42:58,769
- They're late.

869
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:00,272
- What a surprise.

870
00:43:01,973 --> 00:43:05,075
Look, Augie, I don't mind
handling the bookings

871
00:43:05,076 --> 00:43:07,578
and the accounting and the PR.

872
00:43:07,579 --> 00:43:10,242
But I'm just not cut out to be a roadie.

873
00:43:10,243 --> 00:43:14,403
- I know, the guys just
aren't as dedicated I guess.

874
00:43:14,404 --> 00:43:18,149
- Neither was the last band,
or the one before that.

875
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:20,319
Augie, you deserve better.

876
00:43:23,311 --> 00:43:24,314
Well, that's it for the sift,

877
00:43:24,315 --> 00:43:25,575
do you need any help setting up?

878
00:43:25,576 --> 00:43:26,992
- No, I'll handle it.

879
00:43:26,993 --> 00:43:28,580
Why don't you go back
to the house and rest,

880
00:43:28,581 --> 00:43:29,957
or get changed, or eat?

881
00:43:29,958 --> 00:43:31,793
- Or all of the above.

882
00:43:37,689 --> 00:43:40,025
Nice of you guys to show up.

883
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:42,433
- So, after the funeral,
I went to Bob's house

884
00:43:42,434 --> 00:43:44,612
to be with his parents.

885
00:43:44,613 --> 00:43:45,954
And his Dad sold me the car.

886
00:43:45,955 --> 00:43:47,255
- That's my old man,

887
00:43:47,256 --> 00:43:48,718
never let sentimentality get in the way

888
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:50,000
of making a quick buck.

889
00:43:50,001 --> 00:43:52,060
- He said having it
around was too painful.

890
00:43:52,061 --> 00:43:53,405
- Oh, that's so sad.

891
00:43:53,406 --> 00:43:54,619
- It must have been real painful.

892
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:56,823
In his grief, he turned the odometer back.

893
00:43:56,824 --> 00:43:59,491
Unless you've only driven six
miles in the past 10 years.

894
00:43:59,492 --> 00:44:03,335
- Man, this is strange being
back in Bob's car again.

895
00:44:03,336 --> 00:44:05,753
I have had so many
great times in this car.

896
00:44:05,754 --> 00:44:06,837
- Yeah, I know.

897
00:44:06,838 --> 00:44:08,757
Most of them back here.

898
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:14,276
- Trace, I've been
wondering about something.

899
00:44:15,338 --> 00:44:17,105
This is gonna sound stupid, but,

900
00:44:17,106 --> 00:44:20,089
when you first met Bob
and you first met me,

901
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:22,530
what was it that attracted you to Bob?

902
00:44:22,531 --> 00:44:25,235
- Well, that's a toughie.

903
00:44:25,236 --> 00:44:27,821
I mean, he was cute, and funny.

904
00:44:28,861 --> 00:44:30,680
And talented.

905
00:44:30,681 --> 00:44:31,897
- Those are important qualities.

906
00:44:31,898 --> 00:44:34,226
- You know, I guess it was his confidence.

907
00:44:34,227 --> 00:44:35,965
Bob always knew what he wanted,

908
00:44:35,966 --> 00:44:38,086
and went right after it.

909
00:44:38,087 --> 00:44:39,838
Neal's like that too.

910
00:44:40,990 --> 00:44:42,410
- It's confidence, huh?

911
00:44:42,411 --> 00:44:44,593
- Yeah, I mean Bob was like a tidal wave,

912
00:44:44,594 --> 00:44:47,615
just coming at you all at once.

913
00:44:47,616 --> 00:44:49,777
Something like that's
pretty hard to ignore.

914
00:44:49,778 --> 00:44:52,448
You, you're more like a glacier.

915
00:44:54,465 --> 00:44:55,543
- Thanks a lot.

916
00:44:55,544 --> 00:44:57,747
- No, I don't mean
you're cold or anything.

917
00:44:57,748 --> 00:45:00,501
I just mean you move more slowly.

918
00:45:02,153 --> 00:45:04,492
And still you do make your presence felt.

919
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:05,915
- Yeah, after about two million years.

920
00:45:05,916 --> 00:45:07,699
- And I was 22, I don't know,

921
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:09,018
I was young and dumb.

922
00:45:09,019 --> 00:45:11,681
If I'd had any brains, I'd be with you.

923
00:45:11,682 --> 00:45:13,022
- You're kidding.
- You're kidding.

924
00:45:13,023 --> 00:45:14,826
- No, I don't think so.

925
00:45:14,827 --> 00:45:17,127
I mean, I had great times with Bob,

926
00:45:17,128 --> 00:45:21,465
but you and I could always
just talk like grown ups.

927
00:45:22,792 --> 00:45:24,014
You know, a lot of times I called there

928
00:45:24,015 --> 00:45:27,732
knowing he wasn't home,
just so I could talk to you.

929
00:45:27,733 --> 00:45:28,818
- Really?

930
00:45:28,819 --> 00:45:32,524
- Yeah, I mean, Bob could
be a real jerk sometimes.

931
00:45:32,525 --> 00:45:35,844
You know, I loved him and all that, but...

932
00:45:35,845 --> 00:45:38,606
Like that one time I opened
this very glove compartment

933
00:45:38,607 --> 00:45:40,889
and found a bunch of condoms.

934
00:45:40,890 --> 00:45:43,391
- Yeah?
- I was on the pill

935
00:45:43,392 --> 00:45:44,393
at the time.

936
00:45:46,715 --> 00:45:49,581
He just laughed it off
and made a big joke.

937
00:45:49,582 --> 00:45:52,240
- [Bob And Tracy] I keep
'em there in case it rains.

938
00:45:52,241 --> 00:45:53,075
- Yuck.

939
00:45:56,527 --> 00:45:59,028
Hey, you bought my tape!
- Yeah.

940
00:45:59,029 --> 00:46:00,632
- Hey, you haven't opened it.

941
00:46:00,633 --> 00:46:02,714
- No, no, the tape deck's on the blink.

942
00:46:02,715 --> 00:46:04,236
I don't know what's wrong.

943
00:46:04,237 --> 00:46:07,076
Oh my God, you fixed it,
that's great, thank you!

944
00:46:07,077 --> 00:46:08,736
Thanks.
- You didn't like my album.

945
00:46:08,737 --> 00:46:09,739
- What?

946
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:10,973
No, no, that's not it.

947
00:46:10,974 --> 00:46:12,660
I loved it.

948
00:46:12,661 --> 00:46:14,580
I mean, I think it's...

949
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:24,533
It's just that I haven't talked
to you for so long, Tracy.

950
00:46:24,534 --> 00:46:27,176
I figured that you know,

951
00:46:27,177 --> 00:46:29,461
hearing your voice and
not being able to respond

952
00:46:29,462 --> 00:46:32,548
would make me, I don't know, unhappy.

953
00:46:36,407 --> 00:46:39,910
So I bought it, but, I don't listen to it.

954
00:46:41,991 --> 00:46:43,769
It's stupid, I'm sorry.

955
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:46,176
- No, it's okay, I understand.

956
00:46:46,177 --> 00:46:47,011
I'm sorry.

957
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:51,440
I should have kept in touch better.

958
00:46:54,783 --> 00:46:58,437
(bright instrumental music)

959
00:46:58,438 --> 00:47:01,441
(car engine starts)

960
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:26,915
- [Neal] Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

961
00:47:28,981 --> 00:47:31,664
I thought maybe you could
just kiss it better.

962
00:47:31,665 --> 00:47:32,747
- [Ginny] That's not part of the course

963
00:47:32,748 --> 00:47:33,927
where I learned first aid.

964
00:47:33,928 --> 00:47:35,252
- [Neal] Where did you learn first aid?

965
00:47:35,253 --> 00:47:36,309
The girl scouts?

966
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:38,946
- [Ginny] No, the Israeli Army.

967
00:47:38,947 --> 00:47:41,135
- You know, you are fascinating.

968
00:47:41,136 --> 00:47:42,492
Now, don't take this wrong,

969
00:47:42,493 --> 00:47:45,838
but you've always seemed sort of naked.

970
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:47,722
Even with your clothes on.

971
00:47:47,723 --> 00:47:49,724
- That's funny, 'cause
you always seem like

972
00:47:49,725 --> 00:47:52,106
you're wearing a tie.

973
00:47:52,107 --> 00:47:53,345
How's that feel?

974
00:47:53,346 --> 00:47:55,970
- Oh, oh, you've got a nice touch.

975
00:47:55,971 --> 00:47:57,354
Now, be honest.

976
00:47:57,355 --> 00:48:00,329
There was an attraction when
we first met, wasn't there?

977
00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:01,555
- Honestly?

978
00:48:01,556 --> 00:48:03,098
Yeah, I thought you were kind of cute.

979
00:48:03,099 --> 00:48:04,401
(they laugh)

980
00:48:04,402 --> 00:48:05,956
- And you don't think so now?

981
00:48:05,957 --> 00:48:07,444
- Now I think you're kind of engaged.

982
00:48:07,445 --> 00:48:09,323
(they chuckle)

983
00:48:09,324 --> 00:48:11,106
- Are you playing hard to get?

984
00:48:11,107 --> 00:48:12,249
- Hard to get what?

985
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:13,946
- That's up to you.

986
00:48:13,947 --> 00:48:15,645
- Hi, kids, sorry to barge in.

987
00:48:15,646 --> 00:48:16,893
- Ah!
- I've got

988
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:18,931
a splitting headache.

989
00:48:18,932 --> 00:48:20,577
Whew, how's our patient doing, Ginny?

990
00:48:20,578 --> 00:48:21,954
- Oh, he'll be okay.

991
00:48:21,955 --> 00:48:24,737
- Oh he'll be a lot better than just okay.

992
00:48:24,738 --> 00:48:26,355
- My head is pounding.

993
00:48:26,356 --> 00:48:27,661
I hope I'm better by tonight,

994
00:48:27,662 --> 00:48:30,723
Augie is so excited to be
playing for his friends.

995
00:48:30,724 --> 00:48:32,386
He wants you to come too, Neal.

996
00:48:32,387 --> 00:48:33,582
- Oh!

997
00:48:33,583 --> 00:48:34,591
- So, what's for dinner?

998
00:48:34,592 --> 00:48:36,433
- Oh, a little surprise I'm whipping up.

999
00:48:36,434 --> 00:48:38,528
It should be very exciting.

1000
00:48:38,529 --> 00:48:40,415
Ooh, and I'd better get going.

1001
00:48:40,416 --> 00:48:41,584
See you later.

1002
00:48:44,474 --> 00:48:45,897
- What happened to your headache?

1003
00:48:45,898 --> 00:48:47,150
- He just left.

1004
00:48:51,223 --> 00:48:52,526
- I got an idea.

1005
00:48:52,527 --> 00:48:53,524
Let's go for a walk before dinner.

1006
00:48:53,525 --> 00:48:55,027
- Oh, I would but,

1007
00:48:55,028 --> 00:48:57,014
oh thanks, I should take it up there,

1008
00:48:57,015 --> 00:48:58,455
I feel like I've pulled every muscle

1009
00:48:58,456 --> 00:49:00,494
in my body this afternoon.

1010
00:49:00,495 --> 00:49:02,875
I don't want to be limping
down the aisle tomorrow.

1011
00:49:02,876 --> 00:49:03,936
- Nope.

1012
00:49:03,937 --> 00:49:07,701
- Hey, thanks for not
abandoning me at the rink.

1013
00:49:07,702 --> 00:49:10,045
- I tried to, I couldn't
get my skates untied.

1014
00:49:10,046 --> 00:49:13,882
- Well, whatever the
reason, I appreciated it.

1015
00:49:17,195 --> 00:49:19,780
(gentle music)

1016
00:49:26,416 --> 00:49:27,902
- What's wrong?

1017
00:49:27,903 --> 00:49:29,988
Where'd you disappear to?

1018
00:50:15,110 --> 00:50:17,249
- Look at him go.

1019
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:19,609
I always wanted to do that.

1020
00:50:19,610 --> 00:50:23,277
- Learn to be a bird?
- Not just a bird.

1021
00:50:23,278 --> 00:50:24,112
An eagle.

1022
00:50:24,997 --> 00:50:27,740
Nobody messes with you
when you're an eagle.

1023
00:50:27,741 --> 00:50:32,163
- Yeah, but if you're a
pigeon, you get free popcorn.

1024
00:50:34,202 --> 00:50:36,287
- Look at that sucker go.

1025
00:50:37,612 --> 00:50:39,869
Being dead really sucks
sometimes, you know?

1026
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,295
- Really?

1027
00:50:41,296 --> 00:50:44,643
I'm sort of getting the
impression you like being dead.

1028
00:50:44,644 --> 00:50:46,196
- Well, I don't mind it.

1029
00:50:46,197 --> 00:50:48,366
But, I can't recommend it.

1030
00:50:49,497 --> 00:50:52,917
Best thing is, I no longer have to floss.

1031
00:50:54,029 --> 00:50:56,729
- It's your damn fault, you know.

1032
00:50:56,730 --> 00:50:58,811
I mean, talk about a stupid way to die.

1033
00:50:58,812 --> 00:51:00,514
- Hey, hey, I swerved to miss a seagull,

1034
00:51:00,515 --> 00:51:01,715
and this cliff jumper-

1035
00:51:01,716 --> 00:51:04,534
- You will never admit to
making a mistake, will you?

1036
00:51:04,535 --> 00:51:05,962
- All right, sure I will.

1037
00:51:05,963 --> 00:51:06,979
This whole Tracy thing,

1038
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,458
I don't think it's working out.

1039
00:51:08,459 --> 00:51:09,942
- What do you mean, not working out?

1040
00:51:09,943 --> 00:51:11,861
You saw her back there, she kissed me.

1041
00:51:11,862 --> 00:51:12,861
- On the cheek.

1042
00:51:12,862 --> 00:51:15,927
A brother, an uncle, a
priest you kiss on the cheek.

1043
00:51:15,928 --> 00:51:17,790
I say let's forget it, let's drop it.

1044
00:51:17,791 --> 00:51:18,788
- Hey, what's with you?

1045
00:51:18,789 --> 00:51:20,390
I mean, you're the one who
got me started on all this.

1046
00:51:20,391 --> 00:51:22,152
- And I'm the one who's
saying it's not working out.

1047
00:51:22,153 --> 00:51:23,433
- Well, first you don't
want her with Neal,

1048
00:51:23,434 --> 00:51:24,517
and now you don't want her with me.

1049
00:51:24,518 --> 00:51:27,354
Who the hell do you want her with?

1050
00:51:28,623 --> 00:51:30,982
(gentle music)

1051
00:51:30,983 --> 00:51:32,068
Oh, oh right.

1052
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:35,989
Okay, I get it.

1053
00:51:35,990 --> 00:51:38,004
It's okay for Isaac to go after Tracy,

1054
00:51:38,005 --> 00:51:39,012
as long as there's no chance

1055
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:41,115
he might actually score with her, right?

1056
00:51:41,116 --> 00:51:42,114
- Hey, that's not what I'm saying.

1057
00:51:42,115 --> 00:51:43,277
- I'm saying it because I'm not a threat.

1058
00:51:43,278 --> 00:51:46,078
I'm not really a threat to
a big stud like you, right?

1059
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:48,162
You know what, Tracy was right.

1060
00:51:48,163 --> 00:51:49,414
You are a jerk!

1061
00:51:50,864 --> 00:51:52,721
(gentle music)

1062
00:51:52,722 --> 00:51:53,640
- Was, was!

1063
00:51:54,865 --> 00:51:56,534
I'm dead, you idiot!

1064
00:51:57,488 --> 00:52:00,074
(gentle music)

1065
00:52:17,632 --> 00:52:19,588
- You're not listening to
that thing again, are you?

1066
00:52:19,589 --> 00:52:21,071
- Oh, I like it.

1067
00:52:21,072 --> 00:52:23,456
I think it'd be great on the next album.

1068
00:52:23,457 --> 00:52:26,132
- Oh, Tracy, it's not marketable.

1069
00:52:26,133 --> 00:52:27,300
- Well, I don't agree.

1070
00:52:27,301 --> 00:52:28,858
Wait till you hear it with a band playing.

1071
00:52:28,859 --> 00:52:29,862
- I don't have to.

1072
00:52:29,863 --> 00:52:30,882
Sweetie, this is my business.

1073
00:52:30,883 --> 00:52:32,880
I know unorchestrated crap when I hear it.

1074
00:52:32,881 --> 00:52:36,029
- So do I, and I think
Isaac's very talented.

1075
00:52:36,030 --> 00:52:39,072
- No, Isaac is a guy who may
or may not have been talented

1076
00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:40,572
at one time, but never had the cajones

1077
00:52:40,573 --> 00:52:41,933
to do anything about it.

1078
00:52:41,934 --> 00:52:44,256
We got 'em by the truck load in L.A.

1079
00:52:44,257 --> 00:52:46,076
Now come on, give me a hand with dinner.

1080
00:52:46,077 --> 00:52:48,542
- Oh, I haven't decided
what I should wear tonight.

1081
00:52:48,543 --> 00:52:51,041
- Tracy, for heaven
sake's, it's a hick bar.

1082
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:54,148
If you wear shoes you'll be over dressed.

1083
00:52:54,149 --> 00:52:58,236
Look, why don't you and
I just stay home tonight?

1084
00:52:59,709 --> 00:53:01,336
We could open a bottle of wine,

1085
00:53:01,337 --> 00:53:03,773
put on some good music,

1086
00:53:03,774 --> 00:53:05,477
I'll show you where the monkey bit me.

1087
00:53:05,478 --> 00:53:06,539
(they chuckle)

1088
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:09,716
- Honey, I'm looking forward to going.

1089
00:53:09,717 --> 00:53:11,883
Besides, I've got
something special planned.

1090
00:53:11,884 --> 00:53:12,966
- Oh, I don't think I could survive

1091
00:53:12,967 --> 00:53:14,888
another one of your plans.

1092
00:53:14,889 --> 00:53:16,871
Sweetie, I'm sorry, I'm
just not in the mood

1093
00:53:16,872 --> 00:53:18,652
to drink bad three two beer,

1094
00:53:18,653 --> 00:53:20,372
breathe stale cigarette smoke

1095
00:53:20,373 --> 00:53:21,867
and listen to yet another self indulgent

1096
00:53:21,868 --> 00:53:23,975
Van Halenesque guitar solo.

1097
00:53:23,976 --> 00:53:25,978

we can persuade this week's
rock and roll sensation

1129

- What?

1133

1134
00:55:52,285 --> 00:55:55,788
- Neal, don't be silly.
- Tracy, I said no.

00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:01,914

1136
00:56:01,915 --> 00:56:05,817
I'd like to do a cut from
my yet unreleased album.

people with attitude problems.

You know, narrow minded
people, small minded.

I hate that type.

1213
01:01:43,732 --> 01:01:46,513

1214

of an attitude problem.

1215
01:01:48,455 --> 01:01:50,624

care of this right now.

01:03:07,214 --> 01:03:08,312
- Who won?

1235
01:03:08,313 --> 01:03:09,775
- You have to ask?

1236
01:03:09,776 --> 01:03:11,019
- They all did.

1237
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:12,818
Although, I think one
of them cut his knuckles

1238
01:03:12,819 --> 01:03:13,821
on my bridgework.

1239
01:03:13,822 --> 01:03:15,519
- Oh!
- That'll show 'em.

1240
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:17,344
- Neal, I'm so sorry.

1241
01:03:17,345 --> 01:03:19,664
- I didn't want to come up
here in the first place,

1242
01:03:19,665 --> 01:03:21,365
but no, we had to get
married in the middle

1243
01:03:21,366 --> 01:03:23,271
of God-damn nowhere.

1244
01:03:23,272 --> 01:03:24,288
Why?

1245
01:03:24,289 --> 01:03:26,112
What's so special about this place?

1246
01:03:26,113 --> 01:03:27,291
I don't understand why
we couldn't have just

1247
01:03:27,292 --> 01:03:29,162
done it in Vegas like I wanted,

1248
01:03:29,163 --> 01:03:31,165
get this shit over with.

1249
01:03:37,526 --> 01:03:40,029
(tense music)

1250
01:03:50,577 --> 01:03:54,331
- Oh sure, blame the
dead guy for everything.

1251
01:04:04,929 --> 01:04:05,763
- Shut up.

1252
01:04:06,709 --> 01:04:08,292
- He never snaps like that.

1253
01:04:08,293 --> 01:04:11,837
What did I do that was so horrible?

1254
01:04:11,838 --> 01:04:12,840
- Maybe it wasn't you.

1255
01:04:12,841 --> 01:04:14,000
- Oh, it has to be.

1256
01:04:14,001 --> 01:04:15,419
I bring him to meet my friends,

1257
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:18,126
he belittles everybody,
I just want to have fun

1258
01:04:18,127 --> 01:04:20,060
and he complains.

1259
01:04:20,061 --> 01:04:22,462
I dedicate a song to
him, and he walks out.

1260
01:04:22,463 --> 01:04:24,468
- That song was for him?

1261
01:04:24,469 --> 01:04:26,950
- Who else would it be for?

1262
01:04:26,951 --> 01:04:29,287
I just don't understand him.

1263
01:04:30,175 --> 01:04:32,107
Why don't men come with instructions?

1264
01:04:32,108 --> 01:04:33,975
- I could make the same
argument for women.

1265
01:04:33,976 --> 01:04:36,396
(she scoffs)

1266
01:04:43,586 --> 01:04:45,523
Is it true that Bob once marked your body

1267
01:04:45,524 --> 01:04:47,407
with a luminous pen?

1268
01:04:47,408 --> 01:04:49,772
So he could find your
erogenous zones in the dark.

1269
01:04:49,773 --> 01:04:51,429
- No!
- Yes!

1270
01:04:51,430 --> 01:04:53,333
- It's just one of the many Bob legends

1271
01:04:53,334 --> 01:04:54,915
that floated about.

1272
01:04:54,916 --> 01:04:56,658
Most of which he made up.

1273
01:04:56,659 --> 01:04:58,741
- Uh-huh, like the weekend
at the sorority house?

1274
01:04:58,742 --> 01:05:00,242
- All lies.

1275
01:05:00,243 --> 01:05:01,657
- The woman from Fort Worth

1276
01:05:01,658 --> 01:05:02,745
who picked him up hitchhiking?

1277
01:05:02,746 --> 01:05:03,983
- Total fabrication.

1278
01:05:03,984 --> 01:05:05,705
- And that thing with the nun.

1279
01:05:05,706 --> 01:05:08,027
- That one's true.

1280
01:05:08,028 --> 01:05:09,151
- No!

1281
01:05:09,152 --> 01:05:11,314
- You know, this is just like old times.

1282
01:05:11,315 --> 01:05:12,712
Remember Bob and I used to fight,

1283
01:05:12,713 --> 01:05:15,995
and I'd sit up talking to you all night.

1284
01:05:15,996 --> 01:05:17,081
That was fun.

1285
01:05:18,018 --> 01:05:20,797
- The fights?
- No, stupid.

1286
01:05:20,798 --> 01:05:21,632
The talks.

1287
01:05:26,407 --> 01:05:28,576
- I'll have to face north.

1288
01:05:30,993 --> 01:05:33,053
- There you go, north.

1289
01:05:33,054 --> 01:05:34,057
- What's going on?

1290
01:05:34,058 --> 01:05:35,098
- We're having a seance.

1291
01:05:35,099 --> 01:05:37,020
- Oh no.
- I can sense his presence

1292
01:05:37,021 --> 01:05:39,523
here all weekend, which
I think might explain

1293
01:05:39,524 --> 01:05:41,445
the problems Neal's been having.

1294
01:05:41,446 --> 01:05:45,367
Sometimes the spirit
world can shed some light.

1295
01:05:49,332 --> 01:05:54,111
Now, if you'll all join
hands with me, we'll begin.

1296
01:05:54,112 --> 01:05:56,020
I'm going to ask one of my spirit guides

1297
01:05:56,021 --> 01:05:59,691
to help escort us through
to the other side.

1298
01:06:02,348 --> 01:06:04,850
(eerie music)

1299
01:06:07,792 --> 01:06:10,962
(she inhales sharply)

1300
01:06:14,359 --> 01:06:15,777
Oh, spirit guide.

1301
01:06:17,301 --> 01:06:19,438
- Yes, kimosabe.

1302
01:06:19,439 --> 01:06:22,025
(Isaac coughs)

1303
01:06:23,087 --> 01:06:25,922
- Spirit guide, tell us your name.

1304
01:06:27,066 --> 01:06:28,400
Spell it for us.

1305
01:06:29,313 --> 01:06:32,899
- Mystery ghost, won't
you sign in, please.

1306
01:06:39,118 --> 01:06:41,863
- B.
- Oh, it's a trick.

1307
01:06:41,864 --> 01:06:43,210
Somebody's stopping it.

1308
01:06:43,211 --> 01:06:45,190
- How, we're all holding hands.

1309
01:06:45,191 --> 01:06:47,271
- Got a magnet at my dick.

1310
01:06:47,272 --> 01:06:50,053
Hey Ginny, now I can tell
you which way north is.

1311
01:06:50,054 --> 01:06:50,887
- Shh.

1312
01:06:56,139 --> 01:06:58,391
O, it's spelling something.

1313
01:07:05,226 --> 01:07:07,169
G.
- Shit, it's really

1314
01:07:07,170 --> 01:07:09,149
hard to read this thing upside down.

1315
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:09,983
- B, O, G.

1316
01:07:14,336 --> 01:07:16,255
Bog, what does it mean?

1317
01:07:20,251 --> 01:07:21,335
- Bob, maybe?

1318
01:07:22,422 --> 01:07:24,841
- No, Bob has a B at the end.

1319
01:07:28,167 --> 01:07:29,001
Is it Bob?

1320
01:07:38,358 --> 01:07:39,578
- This is too weird.

1321
01:07:39,579 --> 01:07:41,480
Cut it out, you guys.

1322
01:07:41,481 --> 01:07:43,483
- Everybody, hold hands.

1323
01:07:45,205 --> 01:07:47,486
Bob is clearly Earth bound.

1324
01:07:47,487 --> 01:07:50,908
A confused spirit who has
not yet accepted his death.

1325
01:07:50,909 --> 01:07:52,069
- Hey, I've accepted it.

1326
01:07:52,070 --> 01:07:53,753
I stopped getting mail, and everything.

1327
01:07:53,754 --> 01:07:56,770
- Bob, we are all here for you tonight.

1328
01:07:56,771 --> 01:08:00,358
Our energy flows towards
you and you alone.

1329
01:08:03,946 --> 01:08:06,586
Would you like to talk to him, Trace?

1330
01:08:06,587 --> 01:08:07,869
- Talk?

1331
01:08:07,870 --> 01:08:08,788
- Go ahead.

1332
01:08:09,872 --> 01:08:10,706
- I can't.

1333
01:08:12,371 --> 01:08:13,909
- I can.

1334
01:08:13,910 --> 01:08:18,216
Say Bob, in heaven, is
Elvis fat like when he died,

1335
01:08:18,217 --> 01:08:20,698
or thin like when he was cool?

1336
01:08:20,699 --> 01:08:22,342
- Elvis isn't dead.

1337
01:08:22,343 --> 01:08:23,741
- Just yes or no questions.

1338
01:08:23,742 --> 01:08:26,005
Bob can only respond
by tapping once for yes

1339
01:08:26,006 --> 01:08:27,424
and twice for no.

1340
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:30,670
- Where did she learn this crap?

1341
01:08:30,671 --> 01:08:32,423
- Once yes, twice no?

1342
01:08:34,297 --> 01:08:35,798
Have you seen God?

1343
01:08:36,795 --> 01:08:39,465
(knocking once)

1344
01:08:40,681 --> 01:08:42,381
Does He like you?

1345
01:08:42,382 --> 01:08:44,802
(knocking twice)

1346
01:08:44,803 --> 01:08:47,087
Son of a bitch, it is Bob!

1347
01:08:47,088 --> 01:08:49,080
(Isaac laughs)

1348
01:08:49,081 --> 01:08:51,083
- Bob, hi, this is Kris.

1349
01:08:53,947 --> 01:08:55,646
God, isn't this weird?

1350
01:08:55,647 --> 01:08:58,532
(knocking once)

1351
01:08:58,533 --> 01:08:59,909
Is that my question?

1352
01:08:59,910 --> 01:09:01,748
(knocking once)

1353
01:09:01,749 --> 01:09:02,583
Oh.

1354
01:09:03,578 --> 01:09:05,997
- What should my question be?

1355
01:09:07,818 --> 01:09:09,653
Is there an afterlife?

1356
01:09:11,906 --> 01:09:14,659
(knocking twice)

1357
01:09:17,512 --> 01:09:18,346
Bummer.

1358
01:09:23,054 --> 01:09:25,389
- Oh, this is really stupid.

1359
01:09:28,377 --> 01:09:32,464
Bob, you never really said
it when you were here.

1360
01:09:34,367 --> 01:09:35,701
Did you love me?

1361
01:09:38,217 --> 01:09:40,169
(knocking once)

1362
01:09:40,170 --> 01:09:43,735
(Neal knocking once)

1363
01:09:43,736 --> 01:09:45,897
- Oh, that son of a bitch,
Isaac, ask the question again.

1364
01:09:45,898 --> 01:09:48,380
- Bob, let me ask-
- Enough, the spirits

1365
01:09:48,381 --> 01:09:50,264
grow weary.
- Oh shit, the spirit grows

1366
01:09:50,265 --> 01:09:51,876
pissed, Issac, ask her the question again!

1367
01:09:51,877 --> 01:09:53,505
- Please Bob-
- It's too late,

1368
01:09:53,506 --> 01:09:55,725
I feel the energy fading.
- Come on!

1369
01:09:55,726 --> 01:09:57,644
- Let's wrap this up.
- Oh wrap this up!

1370
01:09:57,645 --> 01:09:59,713
- It's time for Bob to
pass on to the next plane.

1371
01:09:59,714 --> 01:10:01,673
- No, no, no, wait, Ginny.
- Follow your spirit guide,

1372
01:10:01,674 --> 01:10:02,758
Bob, pass on.

1373
01:10:10,398 --> 01:10:12,067
- Bob?
- Bob is gone.

1374
01:10:13,024 --> 01:10:16,277
He's moved on to the next astral plane.

1375
01:10:17,986 --> 01:10:21,293
I am drained.
- Can we turn in now?

1376
01:10:21,294 --> 01:10:24,537
- [Tracy] I'll be there in a minute.

1377
01:10:24,538 --> 01:10:27,624
- [Augie] What time is the next show?

1378
01:10:33,284 --> 01:10:34,118
- Bob?

1379
01:10:38,428 --> 01:10:41,014
(solemn music)

1380
01:10:51,345 --> 01:10:52,460
Bob!
- Drinking alone?

1381
01:10:52,461 --> 01:10:55,087
That's the first sign
of a drinking problem.

1382
01:10:55,088 --> 01:10:56,965
- Do not do that.
- Hey, I'm a ghost.

1383
01:10:56,966 --> 01:10:59,888
If I don't spook somebody,
I can't join the union.

1384
01:10:59,889 --> 01:11:01,093
- Ginny sent you away.

1385
01:11:01,094 --> 01:11:02,752
- Hey, I'll leave when
I'm damn good and ready.

1386
01:11:02,753 --> 01:11:05,059
- Ah!
- Sorry, did I startle you?

1387
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:06,116
- No, no.

1388
01:11:06,117 --> 01:11:07,483
Well, yeah, a little.

1389
01:11:07,484 --> 01:11:09,703
Listen, are you okay?

1390
01:11:09,704 --> 01:11:12,826
- I don't know what I am anymore.

1391
01:11:12,827 --> 01:11:14,668
Look, I have a favor to ask.

1392
01:11:14,669 --> 01:11:15,667
- Anything.

1393
01:11:15,668 --> 01:11:17,289
- You know how it's bad
luck for the bride and groom

1394
01:11:17,290 --> 01:11:18,260
to see each other the
night before the wedding,

1395
01:11:18,261 --> 01:11:20,877
blah, blah, blah, would it be okay if Neal

1396
01:11:20,878 --> 01:11:24,240
bunked with you tonight, please?

1397
01:11:24,241 --> 01:11:25,960
- Let me qualify anything.
- Please, please, please,

1398
01:11:25,961 --> 01:11:27,300
please, please, please, please.

1399
01:11:27,301 --> 01:11:28,565
- The things that I do for you.

1400
01:11:28,566 --> 01:11:29,567
- Thank you.

1401
01:11:30,887 --> 01:11:32,972
You're one in a million.

1402
01:11:36,153 --> 01:11:39,406
- Kisses on the cheek don't mean squat.

1403
01:11:41,139 --> 01:11:43,724
(bright music)

1404
01:11:56,573 --> 01:11:59,326
(Isaac coughing)

1405
01:12:05,841 --> 01:12:08,621
(window creaking)

1406
01:12:08,622 --> 01:12:12,709
- Uh, could you open that
just a little bit more?

1407
01:12:15,312 --> 01:12:19,149
Uh, too much, back in
just a couple of inches.

1408
01:12:21,499 --> 01:12:22,497
(window creaking)

1409
01:12:22,498 --> 01:12:23,500
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

1410
01:12:23,501 --> 01:12:26,504
You're past it, now back just a tad.

1411
01:12:27,863 --> 01:12:29,544
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

1412
01:12:29,545 --> 01:12:31,630
Too much, in just a hair.

1413
01:12:53,649 --> 01:12:55,484
Was that so difficult?

1414
01:13:06,996 --> 01:13:10,203
Ah, have you seen my glasses anywhere?

1415
01:13:10,204 --> 01:13:11,564
- I didn't know you wore glasses.

1416
01:13:11,565 --> 01:13:14,068
- Oh yeah, contacts, actually.

1417
01:13:15,482 --> 01:13:19,287
Now where did I put those darn things?

1418
01:13:19,288 --> 01:13:20,206
- Dickhead.

1419
01:13:23,135 --> 01:13:24,655
- Oh, hello!

1420
01:13:24,656 --> 01:13:26,497
I didn't know anyone else was up.

1421
01:13:26,498 --> 01:13:29,284
I was just out for a stroll.

1422
01:13:29,285 --> 01:13:31,642
How's the water?
- It's very cold.

1423
01:13:31,643 --> 01:13:33,185
There are a lot of weeds and slime-

1424
01:13:33,186 --> 01:13:35,583
- Sounds great, do you mind if I join you?

1425
01:13:35,584 --> 01:13:37,228
Oh listen, you have
nothing to worry about,

1426
01:13:37,229 --> 01:13:38,809
I'm practically married.

1427
01:13:38,810 --> 01:13:40,667
I mean, I'm getting marr-

1428
01:13:40,668 --> 01:13:43,815
God, these button holes are small.

1429
01:13:43,816 --> 01:13:46,486
(gentle music)

1430
01:14:21,712 --> 01:14:24,228
(Ginny screaming)
(water splashing)

1431
01:14:24,229 --> 01:14:26,730
(tense music)

1432
01:14:26,731 --> 01:14:29,484
(Ginny laughing)

1433
01:14:31,038 --> 01:14:32,660
- Hey, let's get everybody down here.

1434
01:14:32,661 --> 01:14:33,818
- Shh, no, no, no, no, no.

1435
01:14:33,819 --> 01:14:35,041
They're no fun!

1436
01:14:35,042 --> 01:14:36,504
(Ginny laughs)

1437
01:14:36,505 --> 01:14:39,008
(tense music)

1438
01:14:49,798 --> 01:14:52,801
- Come here and take a look at this.

1439
01:14:53,759 --> 01:14:58,206
This is so incredible, you're
not gonna believe this.

1440
01:14:58,207 --> 01:14:59,421
Come on, where are you going?

1441
01:14:59,422 --> 01:15:00,544
Hey, it's over here.

1442
01:15:00,545 --> 01:15:02,547
Oh, for crying out loud!

1443
01:15:06,412 --> 01:15:07,553
- What's going on?

1444
01:15:07,554 --> 01:15:09,635
- Oh, I was just getting a snack.

1445
01:15:09,636 --> 01:15:11,317
Neal's not keeping you up, is he?

1446
01:15:11,318 --> 01:15:14,058
- Neal, no, not at all.

1447
01:15:14,059 --> 01:15:15,275
Do you mind if I join you?

1448
01:15:15,276 --> 01:15:17,105
- Sure, that'd be nice.

1449
01:15:17,106 --> 01:15:18,120
- No, stupid, open the door,

1450
01:15:18,121 --> 01:15:20,373
let her see that he's gone!

1451
01:15:21,446 --> 01:15:23,781
(he groans)

1452
01:15:25,948 --> 01:15:27,033
Oh, oh, look!

1453
01:15:28,637 --> 01:15:30,472
- I'll be right there.

1454
01:15:31,498 --> 01:15:32,496
What's the matter with you?

1455
01:15:32,497 --> 01:15:35,167
- You're screwing everything up!

1456
01:15:39,645 --> 01:15:40,946
- Is that Ginny?

1457
01:15:40,947 --> 01:15:43,307
(Ginny laughing)

1458
01:15:43,308 --> 01:15:44,726
Bob, she's naked.

1459
01:15:46,429 --> 01:15:47,471
- Thanks for explaining it,

1460
01:15:47,472 --> 01:15:48,850
it's been a long time for me.

1461
01:15:48,851 --> 01:15:51,839
Schmuck, take a look who's with her!

1462
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:54,593
(Ginny laughing)

1463
01:15:55,518 --> 01:15:56,936
- Is that, Jesus!

1464
01:15:57,782 --> 01:16:00,204
- No, and it ain't John
the Baptist either.

1465
01:16:00,205 --> 01:16:01,687
- Isaac.
- What?

1466
01:16:01,688 --> 01:16:03,849
- I was gonna make a ham sandwich, do you?

1467
01:16:03,850 --> 01:16:06,020
- Oh yeah, fine, terrific.

1468
01:16:07,236 --> 01:16:08,654
I'll be right in.

1469
01:16:09,876 --> 01:16:11,415
We're really rotten.

1470
01:16:11,416 --> 01:16:12,933
- Excuse me?

1471
01:16:12,934 --> 01:16:15,163
- Oh, I said cotton.

1472
01:16:15,164 --> 01:16:18,584
Best kind of material for blinds, cotton.

1473
01:16:21,986 --> 01:16:24,065
- I'm rotten, what did I do?

1474
01:16:24,066 --> 01:16:25,713
- You put Neal up tot his, didn't you?

1475
01:16:25,714 --> 01:16:26,957
And you had to involve Ginny.

1476
01:16:26,958 --> 01:16:28,916
- Hey, don't blame me for this, pal!

1477
01:16:28,917 --> 01:16:31,559
This is 100% U.S. grade A Neal.

1478
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:33,284
I just want Tracy to see him in action.

1479
01:16:33,285 --> 01:16:34,981
- How is that gonna make her feel?

1480
01:16:34,982 --> 01:16:36,284
It's gonna crush her, that's how.

1481
01:16:36,285 --> 01:16:37,725
She's still got feelings for the guy,

1482
01:16:37,726 --> 01:16:39,206
whether we like it or not!

1483
01:16:39,207 --> 01:16:40,907
- Isaac?
- What!

1484
01:16:40,908 --> 01:16:42,985
Oh, I'm sorry, what?

1485
01:16:42,986 --> 01:16:45,733
- Do you want mustard in your sandwich?

1486
01:16:45,734 --> 01:16:46,568
- Mustard.

1487
01:16:47,711 --> 01:16:49,118
- You want her to marry that dickhead?

1488
01:16:49,119 --> 01:16:50,820
Or do you want her for yourself?

1489
01:16:50,821 --> 01:16:52,700
Come on, stud, you can do it.

1490
01:16:52,701 --> 01:16:54,585
All you have to do is
pull back the blinds.

1491
01:16:54,586 --> 01:16:56,885
Just pull back the blinds and she's yours.

1492
01:16:56,886 --> 01:16:59,245
- You bastard.
- Pardon me?

1493
01:16:59,246 --> 01:17:02,582
- Mustard, I said, I would love mustard.

1494
01:17:06,715 --> 01:17:07,549
- Okay.

1495
01:17:09,817 --> 01:17:10,819
- You're chicken.

1496
01:17:10,820 --> 01:17:12,699
You've always been chicken.

1497
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:15,363
- I can't do it that way.

1498
01:17:15,364 --> 01:17:17,283
I won't do it that way.

1499
01:17:23,308 --> 01:17:24,695
- You're being completely irrational.

1500
01:17:24,696 --> 01:17:26,617
- No, it's true, it's all Bob's fault.

1501
01:17:26,618 --> 01:17:28,496
- What's he done now?

1502
01:17:28,497 --> 01:17:31,342
- Doesn't anyone sleep around here?

1503
01:17:31,343 --> 01:17:34,001
- Augie feels that if Bob
hadn't died when he did,

1504
01:17:34,002 --> 01:17:36,823
then he would be more
successful right now.

1505
01:17:36,824 --> 01:17:40,471
- The band was right on the
verge before his accident.

1506
01:17:40,472 --> 01:17:41,469
If that hadn't happened,

1507
01:17:41,470 --> 01:17:43,370
I know I wouldn't still be playing dives.

1508
01:17:43,371 --> 01:17:45,153
- Well, I guess we'll never know.

1509
01:17:45,154 --> 01:17:46,775
- Are you guys hungry?

1510
01:17:46,776 --> 01:17:48,028
- Yeah, thanks.

1511
01:17:50,519 --> 01:17:52,579
- Well, at least he said thanks.

1512
01:17:52,580 --> 01:17:53,759
- That's new, isn't it?

1513
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:56,513
(Ginny laughing)

1514
01:18:01,090 --> 01:18:02,674
- This is too easy.

1515
01:18:07,459 --> 01:18:10,555
- So, what's it like being
with the same person for,

1516
01:18:10,556 --> 01:18:12,236
God, how long has it been now?

1517
01:18:12,237 --> 01:18:14,359
- 12 years this Halloween.

1518
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:15,444
- Right, yeah.

1519
01:18:15,445 --> 01:18:17,530
- It's great, most times.

1520
01:18:18,510 --> 01:18:20,345
Sometimes it's a drag.

1521
01:18:21,350 --> 01:18:22,434
I don't know.

1522
01:18:23,651 --> 01:18:26,594
I just think Augie wants
to be more successful

1523
01:18:26,595 --> 01:18:28,994
before he gets married.

1524
01:18:28,995 --> 01:18:31,057
Well anyway, you don't want to
be talking about this stuff,

1525
01:18:31,058 --> 01:18:32,480
you're getting married.

1526
01:18:32,481 --> 01:18:34,400
It's a joyous occasion!

1527
01:18:35,785 --> 01:18:37,546
Hey, you're not getting
cold feet, are you?

1528
01:18:37,547 --> 01:18:39,203
- God, I don't know.

1529
01:18:39,204 --> 01:18:44,028
That whole seance thing
unnerved me more than I thought.

1530
01:18:44,029 --> 01:18:46,531
Maybe I'm really not over Bob.

1531
01:18:48,076 --> 01:18:49,827
- Trace, Bob is dead.

1532
01:18:51,156 --> 01:18:52,799
- Sorry.

1533
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:53,861
Got it.

1534
01:18:53,862 --> 01:18:57,102
- I know, it just feels unresolved.

1535
01:18:57,103 --> 01:18:58,805
Especially tonight.

1536
01:18:58,806 --> 01:18:59,947
Maybe it's just normal,

1537
01:18:59,948 --> 01:19:01,789
when you're making a
big change in your life,

1538
01:19:01,790 --> 01:19:05,073
you look back over the past
and the times you screwed up,

1539
01:19:05,074 --> 01:19:09,173
you know, just to make sure
you're not repeating yourself.

1540
01:19:09,174 --> 01:19:10,008
Right?

1541
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:18,290
(playful music)

1542
01:19:23,711 --> 01:19:27,029
- Do you think maybe in a
past life I was a shark?

1543
01:19:27,030 --> 01:19:29,374
- More like a shrimp, I think.

1544
01:19:29,375 --> 01:19:31,258
- Well, the water's very cold.

1545
01:19:31,259 --> 01:19:33,678
(they laugh)

1546
01:19:35,701 --> 01:19:36,821
- Where are our clothes?

1547
01:19:36,822 --> 01:19:38,285
- We took them off, remember?

1548
01:19:38,286 --> 01:19:39,700
- Didn't we leave them on the dock?

1549
01:19:39,701 --> 01:19:42,150
- Sure, silly, they're on-

1550
01:19:42,151 --> 01:19:44,211
Where the hell are my clothes?

1551
01:19:44,212 --> 01:19:45,684
Christ!
- Relax, I'll go get

1552
01:19:45,685 --> 01:19:47,147
to the house and get some more.

1553
01:19:47,148 --> 01:19:48,433
- No, no, no, no, what
if somebody sees you?

1554
01:19:48,434 --> 01:19:49,437
What do you say?

1555
01:19:49,438 --> 01:19:51,215
- I'll say I'm getting
some clothes for Neal.

1556
01:19:51,216 --> 01:19:52,219
- Forget it, I'll go.

1557
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:53,237
- Okay, I'll come with you.

1558
01:19:53,238 --> 01:19:54,242
- No!

1559
01:19:54,243 --> 01:19:55,937
You stay here, get into the water.

1560
01:19:55,938 --> 01:19:57,125
- But I'm getting all pruney.

1561
01:19:57,126 --> 01:19:57,959
- Stay!

1562
01:20:00,846 --> 01:20:03,704
(gentle music)

1563
01:20:03,705 --> 01:20:06,541
(water splashing)

1564
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:40,005
- [Isaac] No, just now,
when I went to war.

1565
01:20:40,006 --> 01:20:41,424
(Tracy laughs)

1566
01:20:41,425 --> 01:20:42,259
Get it?

1567
01:20:44,671 --> 01:20:47,052
- Isaac, this is really good.

1568
01:20:47,053 --> 01:20:48,733
I didn't know you could cook.

1569
01:20:48,734 --> 01:20:52,905
- There's a lot of things
about me you don't know.

1570
01:20:58,365 --> 01:20:59,506
What are you looking at?

1571
01:20:59,507 --> 01:21:01,825
- Nothing, you all finish up, okay?

1572
01:21:01,826 --> 01:21:03,589
I'll see you in the morning?

1573
01:21:03,590 --> 01:21:04,424
Goodnight.

1574
01:21:11,014 --> 01:21:12,682
- Let her go, Isaac.

1575
01:21:16,244 --> 01:21:18,913
(playful music)

1576
01:21:25,752 --> 01:21:28,175
- Ah!
- This is kinky!

1577
01:21:28,176 --> 01:21:29,512
- I can explain.
- Don't explain,

1578
01:21:29,513 --> 01:21:30,833
I like it!
- You do?

1579
01:21:30,834 --> 01:21:32,638
- You always seem so upset,

1580
01:21:32,639 --> 01:21:34,597
I've never seen this side of you.

1581
01:21:34,598 --> 01:21:37,502
At least not out of doors.

1582
01:21:37,503 --> 01:21:38,778
- Moon's low tonight.

1583
01:21:38,779 --> 01:21:40,198
Sailor's delight.

1584
01:21:41,405 --> 01:21:42,563
(she giggles)

1585
01:21:42,564 --> 01:21:43,929
- Hey, guys!

1586
01:21:43,930 --> 01:21:46,845
Oh, I'm so glad I caught up with you.

1587
01:21:46,846 --> 01:21:49,088
- Neal, why is she wearing your pajamas?

1588
01:21:49,089 --> 01:21:50,755
- Oh Neal, it was incredible.

1589
01:21:50,756 --> 01:21:52,098
You'll never believe what I saw.

1590
01:21:52,099 --> 01:21:53,114
- What'd you see?

1591
01:21:53,115 --> 01:21:55,757
- It was incredible.
- Neal, what did you see?

1592
01:21:55,758 --> 01:21:58,524
- Absolutely mind blowing.

1593
01:21:58,525 --> 01:22:00,527
Oh, here are your pants.

1594
01:22:02,226 --> 01:22:04,466
- Ah, it's not what you think.

1595
01:22:04,467 --> 01:22:08,013
I was swimming, she came by, she was cold,

1596
01:22:08,014 --> 01:22:09,555
so I gave her my pajamas.

1597
01:22:09,556 --> 01:22:10,553
- Neal, don't say anything.

1598
01:22:10,554 --> 01:22:11,557
We'll talk in the morning.

1599
01:22:11,558 --> 01:22:12,753
- Sweetie, nothing happened.
- We'll talk in the morning.

1600
01:22:12,754 --> 01:22:15,924
- Absolutely nothing.
- In the morning.

1601
01:22:16,982 --> 01:22:17,816

I just stopped in to say goodbye.

1619
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:36,993
- Goodbye?

1620
01:23:38,344 --> 01:23:39,762
What about Tracy?

1621
01:23:41,029 --> 01:23:43,889
- Nothing more either of us can do.

1622
01:23:43,890 --> 01:23:46,643
She just seems to fall for jerks.

1623
01:23:48,991 --> 01:23:52,938
Hang gliding was a mistake,
but it wasn't my biggest.

1624

1627
01:24:01,462 --> 01:24:04,382
About me being chicken all my life?

1628
01:24:07,775 --> 01:24:08,609
- Yeah.

1629
01:24:09,655 --> 01:24:11,096
You're not a bad guy, Isaac.

1630
01:24:11,097 --> 01:24:12,099
Every once in a while though,

1631
01:24:12,100 --> 01:24:13,658
you need a kick in the ass.

1632
01:24:13,659 --> 01:24:17,163

1633
01:24:18,762 --> 01:24:19,765

- Hey, don't start
getting mushy on me, okay?

1637
01:24:31,095 --> 01:24:32,346
I'll be around.

1638
01:24:33,460 --> 01:24:34,294
- Where?

1639
01:24:35,281 --> 01:24:38,365
- Reincarnation's like
a cosmic crap shoot.

1640
01:24:38,366 --> 01:24:41,366
Play by the rules, you
might wind up a big winner.

1643
01:24:47,533 --> 01:24:49,950

01:29:25,512 --> 01:29:26,346
- Tracy?

1707
01:29:29,879 --> 01:29:33,438
Tracy, how do you expect a
marriage to work without trust?

1708
01:29:33,439 --> 01:29:35,724
What else do you want me to do?

1709
01:29:35,725 --> 01:29:39,146
I've already-
- This is better than cable.

1710
01:29:42,110 --> 01:29:44,213
- Tracy, we love each
other, you know that.

1711
01:29:44,214 --> 01:29:45,755
- No, I don't know that.

1712
01:29:45,756 --> 01:29:48,014
I do know I will not
allow myself to be treated

1713
01:29:48,015 --> 01:29:49,872
that way ever again.

1714
01:29:49,873 --> 01:29:52,738
Bob got away with it, that
was my fault, I let him.

1715
01:29:52,739 --> 01:29:54,463
I'm older now thank God,

1716

1717
01:29:56,626 --> 01:29:58,808
- Tracy, this is more than a marriage.

1718
01:29:58,809 --> 01:29:59,929
If you walk out on me now,

1719
01:29:59,930 --> 01:30:02,827
that qualifies as breach of contract.

1720
01:30:02,828 --> 01:30:05,055

1727
01:30:37,501 --> 01:30:38,944
- Are you okay?

1728
01:30:38,945 --> 01:30:39,946
- I will be.

1729
01:30:42,789 --> 01:30:44,647
- Listen, I realize you
probably have a lot on your mind

1730
01:30:44,648 --> 01:30:46,317
this morning, but...

1731
01:30:47,834 --> 01:30:50,540
Could I ask you one key question?

1732
01:30:50,541 --> 01:30:51,625
- Sure, what?

1733
01:30:54,604 --> 01:30:56,462
- Do you know how to tie a bow tie?

1734
01:30:56,463 --> 01:30:59,603
(she laughs)

1735
01:30:59,604 --> 01:31:01,606
No, wait, that's not it.

1736
01:31:02,466 --> 01:31:05,136
I mean, I need to tie it, but...

1737
01:31:06,445 --> 01:31:08,114
Listen, Tracy.

1738
01:31:08,115 --> 01:31:09,631
About last night.

1739
01:31:09,632 --> 01:31:14,456
- Oh, hey, last night was a
weird night, for everybody.

1740
01:31:14,457 --> 01:31:16,682
God, I guess it finally
dawned on me that Neal

1741
01:31:16,683 --> 01:31:18,557
had all of Bob's bad qualities,

1742
01:31:18,558 --> 01:31:21,002
but none of the good ones.

1743
01:31:21,003 --> 01:31:23,446
You know, sometimes a tidal
wave will sweep you away

1744
01:31:23,447 --> 01:31:25,886
and sometimes it'll just drown you.

1745
01:31:25,887 --> 01:31:27,610
- [Kris] Tracy, telephone!

1746
01:31:27,611 --> 01:31:29,393
Long distance.

1747
01:31:29,394 --> 01:31:31,315
- Hi, this is Tracy.
- Tracy, listen.

1748
01:31:31,316 --> 01:31:33,195
- Hi, Sol.
- Listen, you're beautiful,

1749
01:31:33,196 --> 01:31:34,029
can I talk to-
- No, actually,

1750
01:31:34,030 --> 01:31:34,862
you can't speak to Neal,

1751
01:31:34,863 --> 01:31:36,978
he's gone.
- For coffee?

1752
01:31:36,979 --> 01:31:39,327
- No, for good.
- Oh, you made my day!

1753
01:31:39,328 --> 01:31:40,586
- Thanks, Sol.

1754
01:31:40,587 --> 01:31:42,332
So, what's going on?

1755
01:31:42,333 --> 01:31:43,453
- What is going on?

1756
01:31:43,454 --> 01:31:44,788
Where'd Neal go?

1757
01:31:46,977 --> 01:31:48,434
(she chuckles)

1758
01:31:48,435 --> 01:31:50,276
- Hey, is this wedding on or off?

1759
01:31:50,277 --> 01:31:52,641
- Off, I think.
- What do I do

1760
01:31:52,642 --> 01:31:54,622
with this Rabbi here?

1761
01:31:54,623 --> 01:31:56,875
- Actually, I'm a Minister.

1762
01:31:58,886 --> 01:32:02,307
- Trace, shall we send the Reverend home?

1763
01:32:06,277 --> 01:32:07,111
- Jesus!

1764
01:32:08,258 --> 01:32:10,280
Excuse me, Rev.

1765
01:32:10,281 --> 01:32:12,842
Christ, Ginny, what the
hell happened to you?

1766
01:32:12,843 --> 01:32:14,595
- A miracle, I think.

1767
01:32:15,965 --> 01:32:18,301
Last night, a sign, a stick,

1768
01:32:19,789 --> 01:32:24,430
an old dead branch stood
upright by itself and...

1769
01:32:24,431 --> 01:32:26,494
And wrote a word in the sand.

1770
01:32:26,495 --> 01:32:28,154
- [Kris] What did it say?

1771
01:32:28,155 --> 01:32:28,988
- Schmuck.

1772
01:32:30,579 --> 01:32:32,096
And it hit me.

1773
01:32:32,097 --> 01:32:34,157
I am being a schmuck.

1774
01:32:34,158 --> 01:32:36,626
I have traveled from one end
of this Earth to the other,

1775
01:32:36,627 --> 01:32:38,367
trying to figure out what life was,

1776
01:32:38,368 --> 01:32:41,064
what God was, what I was.

1777
01:32:41,065 --> 01:32:43,150
And last night it hit me.

1778
01:32:44,395 --> 01:32:45,813
I think too much.

1779
01:32:47,177 --> 01:32:49,258
I mean, life is really not that bad,

1780
01:32:49,259 --> 01:32:51,100
unless you think it to death.

1781
01:32:51,101 --> 01:32:52,621
I got to work on that.

1782
01:32:52,622 --> 01:32:54,180
But you know what they say.

1783
01:32:54,181 --> 01:32:57,885
Rejoice not in inequity,
but rejoice in the truth.

1784
01:32:57,886 --> 01:33:00,090
Bear all things.
- Believe all things,

1785
01:33:00,091 --> 01:33:03,131
trust all things, endure all things.

1786
01:33:03,132 --> 01:33:03,965
Very nice.

1787
01:33:04,831 --> 01:33:07,535
Corinthians chapter 13, verse five.

1788
01:33:07,536 --> 01:33:08,637
- Verse six.

1789
01:33:08,638 --> 01:33:10,938
But what the hell.

1790
01:33:10,939 --> 01:33:13,396
- Say, Augie, I'm in the
market for a temporary drummer.

1791
01:33:13,397 --> 01:33:15,081
You interested?

1792
01:33:15,082 --> 01:33:17,745
- Trace, about the Reverend here.

1793
01:33:17,746 --> 01:33:19,405
- He plays the drums?

1794
01:33:19,406 --> 01:33:20,766
- What do you mean temporary?

1795
01:33:20,767 --> 01:33:22,090
- Well, eight months.

1796
01:33:22,091 --> 01:33:24,712
I just found out, my drummer
broke his wrist last night,

1797
01:33:24,713 --> 01:33:28,278
in of all things, a
roller skating accident.

1798
01:33:28,279 --> 01:33:29,799
So we're going out on
tour for eight months,

1799
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:31,717
I can't promise you
anything more than that.

1800
01:33:31,718 --> 01:33:33,702
- Listen, you don't
have to do this for me.

1801
01:33:33,703 --> 01:33:34,700
- I'm not doing this for you,

1802
01:33:34,701 --> 01:33:37,407
I'm in a bind, you'd be doing me a favor.

1803
01:33:37,408 --> 01:33:38,242
- Okay.

1804
01:33:39,309 --> 01:33:40,449
All right.

1805
01:33:40,450 --> 01:33:41,491
But now you owe me one.

1806
01:33:41,492 --> 01:33:42,628
(they laugh)

1807
01:33:42,629 --> 01:33:47,270
Eight months, hell, that's
practically a career for me!

1808
01:33:47,271 --> 01:33:49,035
- Trace, what about the Reverend here?

1809
01:33:49,036 --> 01:33:51,121
- Okay, hang on, hang on.

1810
01:33:52,943 --> 01:33:56,030
The wedding will start in 10 minutes.

1811
01:33:59,569 --> 01:34:02,322
- Well so, who's the happy groom?

1812
01:34:04,054 --> 01:34:06,812
- Beats the hell out of me.

1813
01:34:06,813 --> 01:34:09,399
(gentle music)

1814
01:34:11,138 --> 01:34:13,807
(birds singing)

1815
01:34:38,107 --> 01:34:41,110
I suppose now's a lousy time to ask.

1816
01:34:42,328 --> 01:34:43,829
Will you marry me?

1817
01:34:45,034 --> 01:34:45,867
- Yes.

1818
01:34:47,836 --> 01:34:49,334
- Yeah, you would!

1819
01:34:49,335 --> 01:34:51,754
(she laughs)

1820
01:34:52,881 --> 01:34:54,423
- Dearly beloved, we
are gathered here today

1821
01:34:54,424 --> 01:34:55,683
under the sight of God

1822
01:34:55,684 --> 01:34:58,140
and in the presence of these witnesses

1823
01:34:58,141 --> 01:35:00,369
to join together this man and this woman

1824
01:35:00,370 --> 01:35:03,013
in the bonds of holy matrimony.

1825
01:35:03,014 --> 01:35:04,389
Please repeat after me.

1826
01:35:04,390 --> 01:35:05,224
I, Augie.

1827
01:35:06,697 --> 01:35:07,615
- I, Augie.

1828
01:35:08,598 --> 01:35:10,956
- Take you, Kris.
- Take you, Kris.

1829
01:35:10,957 --> 01:35:12,521
- [Minister] To be my
lawfully wedded wife.

1830
01:35:12,522 --> 01:35:14,320
- [Augie] To be my lawfully wedded wife.

1831
01:35:14,321 --> 01:35:17,086
- To have and to hold.
- To have and to hold.

1832
01:35:17,087 --> 01:35:19,429
- From this day forward.
- From this day forward.

1833
01:35:19,430 --> 01:35:20,264
- What?

1834
01:35:22,452 --> 01:35:23,620
It's a pigeon.

1835
01:35:24,651 --> 01:35:25,485
- I know.

1836
01:35:26,792 --> 01:35:30,059
But I bet he wishes he was an eagle.

1837
01:35:30,060 --> 01:35:32,645
(gentle music)

1838
01:35:34,965 --> 01:35:38,088
(birds singing)

1839
01:35:38,089 --> 01:35:40,841
(wings flapping)

1840
01:35:58,509 --> 01:36:00,270
- Until death do us part.

1841
01:36:00,271 --> 01:36:02,352
- Until death do us part.

1842
01:36:02,353 --> 01:36:04,855
- By the power invested in me,

1843
01:36:05,796 --> 01:36:07,595
I now pronounce you man and wife.

1844
01:36:07,596 --> 01:36:09,515
You may kiss the bride.

1845
01:36:10,519 --> 01:36:13,105
