1
00:00:16,967 --> 00:00:19,176
MAN: Kate, you come here right now!

2
00:00:19,177 --> 00:00:21,387
(WHIMPERING)

3
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:23,210
- Oh, God. Oh, my God.
- Kate!

4
00:00:28,979 --> 00:00:30,396
Daddy, please, just listen to me.

5
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:32,022
- Just listen to me, please.
- Katherine, you stop.

6
00:00:32,023 --> 00:00:34,191
You don't understand.
No, please, daddy, no!

7
00:00:34,192 --> 00:00:35,985
Get away from there.

8
00:00:35,986 --> 00:00:37,808
No, no, please.

9
00:00:41,658 --> 00:00:44,495
Ooh! Ugh!

10
00:00:46,496 --> 00:00:48,898
Bitch!

11
00:00:56,715 --> 00:00:58,841
Come back here.

12
00:00:58,842 --> 00:01:01,385
Katherine, come here.

13
00:01:01,386 --> 00:01:04,915
You get out of there.
Come back here.

14
00:01:50,602 --> 00:01:54,730
So why do you need a surrogate?

15
00:01:54,731 --> 00:01:58,442
Well, four years ago I miscarried,

16
00:01:58,443 --> 00:02:02,518
and shortly after I was
diagnosed with ovarian cancer.

17
00:02:03,615 --> 00:02:05,658
I always knew that I
wanted to have children,

18
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:08,244
so I had my eggs frozen and...

19
00:02:08,245 --> 00:02:13,415
Then they took out the ovaries and
the tubes and... you name it.

20
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:15,918
And then just last month I was told

21
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:19,171
that I have one viable
embryo left in the fridge,

22
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:22,258
so this is my last shot.

23
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:24,260
Are you married?

24
00:02:24,261 --> 00:02:26,571
Yeah, he's... he's excited
about doing this.

25
00:02:26,572 --> 00:02:30,850
- What's his name? What does he do?
- Jacob. He's a writer and a teacher.

26
00:02:30,851 --> 00:02:36,772
Jacob, Jacob Kelly? Jacob
Kelly, the novelist?

27
00:02:36,773 --> 00:02:38,942
That's my guy.

28
00:02:39,943 --> 00:02:43,279
So like we talked about
in last semester's class,

29
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,533
what your character does,
particularly at the end of the story,

30
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:51,537
spells out the meaning
of the story.

31
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:54,123
Ms. McKendrick, your ending,

32
00:02:54,124 --> 00:02:59,129
who does what to whom
with which and why?

33
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:04,216
Well, she kills the bad girl,

34
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:08,304
but that's so cliche.
My story sucks.

35
00:03:08,305 --> 00:03:10,639
Not so fast. What
does your villain do?

36
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,311
Remember, everyone, your villain is more
important to the plot than your hero.

37
00:03:15,312 --> 00:03:18,898
So keep an eye on the bad
girl. What else you got?

38
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:21,176
Well, it's about this little boy...

39
00:03:26,531 --> 00:03:29,992
And it's about their relationship.

40
00:03:29,993 --> 00:03:33,203
There's a scene where the
girl's in love with the guy.

41
00:03:33,204 --> 00:03:34,496
- Yeah.
- Right, okay?

42
00:03:34,497 --> 00:03:35,664
So how do you show it?

43
00:03:35,665 --> 00:03:37,041
Well, I don't want to be obvious.

44
00:03:37,042 --> 00:03:39,115
No, it's okay. Please, be obvious.

45
00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:43,380
You all know Kate, right?

46
00:03:43,381 --> 00:03:45,341
Works in the front office.

47
00:03:45,342 --> 00:03:51,263
So let's say your character
does something like...

48
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:55,168
And you can just help me demonstrate
here, something like...

49
00:04:00,357 --> 00:04:02,600
Oh, Professor Kelly.

50
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:10,525
Oh, my gosh.

(OMINOUS MUSIC)

52
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:34,264
I seriously think this
semester more than any other

53
00:04:34,265 --> 00:04:36,058
the kids seem really,
really engaged.

54
00:04:36,059 --> 00:04:38,678
You should hear some
of the stories...

55
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:57,079
- Hi, Jacob.
- Hi. Hey.

56
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,498
I wanted to tell you that
everybody in the office

57
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:01,291
thinks that you are one of
the best teachers on campus.

58
00:05:01,292 --> 00:05:02,584
Thank you.

59
00:05:02,585 --> 00:05:05,462
- Would you sign this?
- Sure.

60
00:05:05,463 --> 00:05:07,256
I'm excited to start reading it.

61
00:05:07,257 --> 00:05:10,426
If only you knew how much I
needed to hear that right now.

62
00:05:10,427 --> 00:05:12,428
Are you working on anything now?

63
00:05:12,429 --> 00:05:15,764
Yeah, I'm working on a
new outline right now.

64
00:05:15,765 --> 00:05:18,934
So, um, uh...

65
00:05:18,935 --> 00:05:22,104
Truthfully, I have sort of been
blocked for a while lately.

66
00:05:22,105 --> 00:05:24,356
But I'll get back to it someday.

67
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:27,286
Well, I'm sure whichever novel
you do next will be amazing.

68
00:05:27,287 --> 00:05:28,277
Thanks.

69
00:05:28,278 --> 00:05:32,031
- Hey, sweetie. Sorry, I'm late.
- Hey, hi.

00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:35,034
I was showing a house on the west
side and the buyer was late.

Oh, man. Kate, you
remember my wife, Allison.

Yes, hi, from the Christmas party.

73
00:05:39,622 --> 00:05:41,623
Yes, hi, Kate. Good. How are you?

74
00:05:41,624 --> 00:05:43,459
Good. How's the real es...?

75
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,820
- Hey, can I talk to you real quick?
- Sure, yeah.

76
00:05:52,844 --> 00:05:54,178
I don't know if I could do it.

he cheated on me.

Oh, you didn't know?

81
00:06:03,021 --> 00:06:05,022
Yeah, he talked about it on TV.

82
00:06:05,023 --> 00:06:06,815
Happened about five years ago.

83
00:06:06,816 --> 00:06:08,567
With who?

84
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:10,736
Some old girlfriend from college.

85
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:14,531
You know, maybe I
could forgive him.

86
00:06:14,532 --> 00:06:16,775
Good-looking man like that?

87
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,585
ALLISON: So the cost is a
little more than we thought.

88
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:28,045
JACOB: What are we talking about?

89
00:06:28,046 --> 00:06:31,173
All in, about 90.

90
00:06:31,174 --> 00:06:33,008
$90,000?

91
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:34,843
I thought it was
going to be like 15.

92
00:06:34,844 --> 00:06:37,012
Well, 15 is the surrogate's fee,

93
00:06:37,013 --> 00:06:39,223
and then there's the
fertility drugs and the IVF,

94
00:06:39,224 --> 00:06:42,351
and they've got to transfer the
embryo and... there's a lot.

95
00:06:42,352 --> 00:06:44,686
I mean, you know, we talked
about this a year ago.

96
00:06:44,687 --> 00:06:48,857
Yeah, I know we
suggested this before,

97
00:06:48,858 --> 00:06:50,567
but why don't we just
get a friend to do it?

98
00:06:50,568 --> 00:06:54,196
Okay, who? I mean,
do you know someone?

99
00:06:54,197 --> 00:06:56,532
Well, no.

100
00:06:56,533 --> 00:06:59,451
Look, I really like this girl.

101
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:01,078
Her name is Remy.

102
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:03,455
We have a meeting with her
tomorrow morning at 10.00 A.M.

103
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:05,415
At the carrier's clinic.

104
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:08,660
Okay.

105
00:07:12,549 --> 00:07:15,452
Please don't worry. I've got time.

106
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:48,667
WOMAN: I was a surrogate for
my older sister three years ago,

107
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:53,589
and, well, I really loved
being pregnant, you know?

108
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:57,926
And the feeling of having a
life growing inside you it's...

109
00:07:57,927 --> 00:07:59,595
It's just indescribable.

110
00:07:59,596 --> 00:08:03,932
And... and I would want every
woman to experience that.

111
00:08:03,933 --> 00:08:07,102
And my heart goes out
to women who can't,

112
00:08:07,103 --> 00:08:11,106
and, you know, that's the
main reason why I do this.

113
00:08:11,107 --> 00:08:14,318
And what guarantee
do we have, that...

114
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:20,032
And, no offense, that Remy won't be
out drinking and partying all night?

115
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:23,160
Well, all of our surrogates
are tested regularly.

116
00:08:23,161 --> 00:08:24,953
- That won't be an issue.
- Okay.

117
00:08:24,954 --> 00:08:28,457
Besides, Remy has never been
a party animal, correct?

118
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:33,128
That's right. I'm pretty boring.

119
00:08:33,129 --> 00:08:35,797
Now, why don't the two of you
go away, think about it,

120
00:08:35,798 --> 00:08:37,382
and when you've reached a decision,

121
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:40,177
come back and we'll talk about it?

122
00:08:40,178 --> 00:08:45,474
Actually, we are ready to do this.

123
00:08:45,475 --> 00:08:48,644
Well, good, great.

124
00:08:48,645 --> 00:08:50,145
Here you go.

125
00:08:50,146 --> 00:08:51,563
Where do we sign?

127
00:08:57,695 --> 00:09:00,072
Yeah, that was quick.

128
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:02,824
That was very fast.

129
00:09:02,825 --> 00:09:04,576
Well, all right, so
we're gonna do this.

130
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:07,230
I'm really looking forward to it.

131
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:18,840
Well, that was... That was quick.

132
00:09:18,841 --> 00:09:21,009
And, uh, and I guess this is it.

133
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:22,761
Hey, listen, we can
give you a ride.

134
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:24,012
Oh, no, the metro's really close.

135
00:09:24,013 --> 00:09:25,764
- Thank you, though.
- Sure.

136
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:28,016
And I guess we'll see you
at the hospital next week.

137
00:09:28,017 --> 00:09:29,601
Okay, great.

138
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:32,854

right out there.

Yeah. Yeah, okay, well
it was nice meeting you.

142
00:09:40,571 --> 00:09:41,863
- Nice meeting you.
- Bye.

00:09:41,864 --> 00:09:44,392
Okay, bye.

144
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:19,127
Oh, come on, don't do this.

145
00:11:19,128 --> 00:11:20,712
I'm sorry.

146
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:23,548
How... how am I supposed be
excited about the thought of you

147
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:26,468
carrying someone else's
fetus inside of you?

148
00:11:26,469 --> 00:11:28,345
We need the money, Matt.

149
00:11:28,346 --> 00:11:31,306
I'm doing this for us.

150
00:11:31,307 --> 00:11:33,642
I know.

151
00:11:33,643 --> 00:11:35,644
So what do they do for a living?

152
00:11:35,645 --> 00:11:40,524
Well, she is a real estate agent,

153
00:11:40,525 --> 00:11:42,818
and he's a famous novelist.

154
00:11:42,819 --> 00:11:44,027
- Really?
- Yeah.

155
00:11:44,028 --> 00:11:45,821
What's his name?

156
00:11:45,822 --> 00:11:47,322
Jacob Kelly.

157
00:11:47,323 --> 00:11:48,532
I have never heard of him.

158
00:11:48,533 --> 00:11:51,201
- Okay, okay.
- I'm going to shower.

159
00:11:51,202 --> 00:11:54,230
Oh. Oh.

160
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:01,253
- Ooh!
- What?

161
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:06,925
Nancy just texted me.
She's back in town.

- Nice to meet you.

Nice to meet you.
Thank you so much.

Yeah, a friend of mine.

00:24:00,973 --> 00:24:03,641
Would you just give us a second?

350
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:06,716
Oh. Of course.

351
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:18,781
We barely know her.

352
00:24:18,782 --> 00:24:20,449
We know her better than
we knew the last girl,

353
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:22,351
and I'm not going back to
one of those agencies.

354
00:24:22,352 --> 00:24:23,828
I don't know.

355
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:26,497
I like the fact that she gave
her baby up for adoption.

356
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:29,834
That shows me that she wants
what's best for the child.

357
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:34,565
Listen, I know how badly
you want this baby.

358
00:24:36,133 --> 00:24:38,661
And I do too.

359
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:48,603
ALLISON: All right.

360
00:24:49,604 --> 00:24:51,647
I need to be straight with you.

361
00:24:51,648 --> 00:24:53,816
We've put 12 embryos
in the freezer.

362
00:24:53,817 --> 00:24:56,778
11 of them didn't make it.

363
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:02,617
We have one viable embryo,
one chance to make this work.

364
00:25:02,618 --> 00:25:04,827
You've got to promise me
you won't let us down.

365
00:25:04,828 --> 00:25:06,600
I won't.

366
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,950
All right. Let's make a baby.

367
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:18,299
Oh, my gosh.

368
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,218
Uh, we drew up this contract.

369
00:25:20,219 --> 00:25:23,038
You can just take it home and
take a look, okay? Just give it a...

370
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,680
Let's take a picture
of all three of us.

371
00:25:24,681 --> 00:25:25,481
- Yes.
- Yes.

372
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:27,183
Oh, my, gosh, okay.

373
00:25:27,184 --> 00:25:28,398
- Can you do it?
- Do you want...

374
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,131
- Yeah. Yeah, right there.
- Okay.

375
00:25:32,356 --> 00:25:34,524
All right, like that?

376
00:25:44,493 --> 00:25:46,869
Okay, Kate, now I'm going
to extend the catheter

377
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:49,372
through your cervix to
the top of your uterus.

378
00:25:49,373 --> 00:25:52,250
JACOB: Now it might be a
little bit uncomfortable,

379
00:25:52,251 --> 00:25:54,919
but it should only take a minute.

380
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:58,381
Take as much time as you want.

381
00:25:58,382 --> 00:26:01,535
I want to enjoy this.

382
00:26:35,043 --> 00:26:38,379
She was with some chick.

383
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:40,131
Can you... Can you describe her?

384
00:26:40,132 --> 00:26:42,883
Brunette, short hair, hot body.

385
00:26:42,884 --> 00:26:44,719
I don't know. I can't get
more specific than that.

386
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,388
I get 20 or 30 of her
in here every night.

387
00:26:47,389 --> 00:26:50,141
Was she with anybody else?

388
00:26:50,142 --> 00:26:52,235
Not really, no.

389
00:26:52,936 --> 00:26:55,938
But her friend, though,
short hair brunette girl,

390
00:26:55,939 --> 00:27:00,109
there was this one guy
hitting on her pretty hard.

391
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:02,403
He comes in here
every now and then.

392
00:27:02,404 --> 00:27:04,602
He's, like, an Iranian guy.

393
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:11,412
So did you find a cure
for your writer's block?

394
00:27:11,413 --> 00:27:14,748
Actually, I'll be taking on
more classes next semester,

395
00:27:14,749 --> 00:27:18,852
so there just isn't time
to write another book.

396
00:27:18,853 --> 00:27:21,505
- Come on, sweetie.
- Hey, why don't you leave that...

397
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:23,590
and why don't you go show
Kate the nursery upstairs?

398
00:27:23,591 --> 00:27:27,328
Oh, Kate, wait till you
see it. It's so cute.

399
00:27:28,029 --> 00:27:32,767
You should never stop writing.
That's your gift to the world.

400
00:27:32,768 --> 00:27:37,472
You should be able to write
all day long if you want to.

401
00:27:42,277 --> 00:27:44,945
I'm sorry.

402
00:27:44,946 --> 00:27:50,826
I just, I really, really
enjoyed your book.

403
00:27:50,827 --> 00:27:53,229
That's all.

404
00:27:59,836 --> 00:28:02,004
Oh, wow.

405
00:28:02,005 --> 00:28:04,006
Oh, this is so cute.

406
00:28:04,007 --> 00:28:07,885
Yeah, we put it together a couple
of years ago before I miscarried.

407
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:09,136
Oh.

408
00:28:09,137 --> 00:28:11,138
Look at this.

409
00:28:11,139 --> 00:28:13,057
And these.

410
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:15,476
Jacob actually built this crib.

411
00:28:15,477 --> 00:28:17,895
Well, do you want a boy or a girl?

412
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:22,149
Well, hopefully just
someone who likes pink.

413
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:24,894
Have you guys picked a name?

414
00:28:31,034 --> 00:28:33,077
Oh.

415
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:34,537
It's my grandma's name.

416
00:28:34,538 --> 00:28:36,664
My mom actually made this.

417
00:28:36,665 --> 00:28:38,332
Oh, Allison, you have no idea

418
00:28:38,333 --> 00:28:40,751
how happy it makes me
to see you so excited.

419
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:45,032
Well, you are literally making
our dreams come true, so...

420
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:53,055
So, what's it like knowing

421
00:28:53,056 --> 00:28:56,851
pretty soon you're
going to be a mom?

422
00:28:56,852 --> 00:29:01,382
It's, um, it's as if...

423
00:29:02,691 --> 00:29:08,612
I already have this...
Connection to her

424
00:29:08,613 --> 00:29:13,409
even though I haven't even met her.

425
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:14,952
I lay in bed at night

426
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:19,457
dreaming about what it'll
feel like to hold her.

427
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:23,794
I've been waiting for years.

428
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:29,604
But I know in my heart that
everything is going to be...

429
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:32,150
wonderful.

430
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:35,389
- Okay, ready? Okay.
- Yes.

431
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:37,133
- Smile. Gorgeous.
- I'm smiling.

432
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:39,101
Your turn.

433
00:29:39,102 --> 00:29:41,312
- I... I don't really... I don't...
- Just do it.

434
00:29:41,313 --> 00:29:44,148
- Smile, okay?
- Okay.

435
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:45,483
Okay, perfect. Give me two secs.

436
00:29:45,484 --> 00:29:48,319
- Weird.
- Quirky.

437
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,905
All right, dessert.

438
00:29:50,906 --> 00:29:52,748
Okay, let's check this out.
What are you having?

439
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,742
- Okay, ready?
- Yeah.

440
00:29:54,743 --> 00:29:58,245
- Okay, look.
- What?

441
00:29:58,246 --> 00:29:59,580
Oh, you got to check this out.

442
00:29:59,581 --> 00:30:00,789
It's cool right?

443
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:03,417
Look.

444
00:30:03,418 --> 00:30:08,173
It's an app. I downloaded it.
It's "make your baby's face.com".

445
00:30:10,174 --> 00:30:14,730
Oh, my God. It's amazing, Kate.

446
00:30:16,631 --> 00:30:20,434
- I can e-mail you a copy if you want.
- Yeah.

447
00:30:20,435 --> 00:30:23,144
Do you mind if I use the restroom?

448
00:30:23,145 --> 00:30:25,213
- Yeah, of course.
- Thanks.

449
00:30:31,812 --> 00:30:33,680
It's incredible.

450
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:10,418
- Special delivery.
- Thank you.

451
00:32:10,419 --> 00:32:14,949
- Who are these from?
- I have no idea.

452
00:32:56,298 --> 00:32:58,575
Hey.

453
00:33:08,268 --> 00:33:10,269
No abnormalities that I can see.

454
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:12,689
Bloodflow is good.

455
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:15,469
Everything looks normal.

456
00:33:37,131 --> 00:33:40,466
Matt, couple months waiting
around paid off, buddy.

457
00:33:40,467 --> 00:33:44,070
That's your guy. Right
down there, black shirt.

458
00:33:45,305 --> 00:33:49,851
So this girl that she was with, the
bartender said she had dark hair.

459
00:33:49,852 --> 00:33:52,311
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Her name was Susan.

460
00:33:52,812 --> 00:33:55,757
She was gorgeous, man.
But she blew me off.

461
00:33:55,858 --> 00:33:59,861
I was about to drive home when
I saw her walking to her car.

462
00:33:59,862 --> 00:34:01,221
What kind of car?

463
00:34:01,222 --> 00:34:05,366
It's a blue Mazda Hatchback.
You know what?

464
00:34:05,367 --> 00:34:08,677
She did have one of those employee
parking stickers on her car.

465
00:34:08,678 --> 00:34:12,633
It was... it was for a college.

466
00:34:13,834 --> 00:34:14,917
Whitmore?

467
00:34:14,918 --> 00:34:16,711
Whittendale?

468
00:34:16,712 --> 00:34:19,865
Yeah, that was it. That was it.

469
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:53,459
(RINGS DOORBELL)

470
00:36:00,482 --> 00:36:02,859
Hey, Kate. What are you doing here?

471
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:06,062
- Can I come in?
- Sure.

472
00:36:11,185 --> 00:36:12,852
What is it? What's the matter?

473
00:36:12,853 --> 00:36:17,298
- Nothing. You're not going to understand.
- Something's wrong. You can tell me.

474
00:36:17,299 --> 00:36:18,692
- You can talk to me.
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

475
00:36:18,693 --> 00:36:20,193
Okay, why don't you sit down?

476
00:36:20,194 --> 00:36:21,236
- No.
- I'll get you a glass of water.

477
00:36:21,237 --> 00:36:22,279
Water is fine. Water is good.

478
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,832
- Okay. All right.
- Okay.

479
00:36:34,341 --> 00:36:37,240
Okay. Here you go. Take a sip.

480
00:36:38,254 --> 00:36:43,317
Okay. Now tell me what's the matter.
You're starting to scare me a little bit.

481
00:36:43,318 --> 00:36:46,098
It's... you're not going to
understand if I tell you.

482
00:36:57,164 --> 00:37:00,046
- I got to go.
- Kate what... wait a second.

483
00:37:01,172 --> 00:37:02,869
- No!
- Kate.

484
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,087
- Don't touch me!
- Kate. Kate.

485
00:37:04,088 --> 00:37:06,048
- No!
- Kate.

486
00:37:06,049 --> 00:37:08,759
Leave me alone!

487
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,653
Jacob, what's wrong with her?
Where is she... Where is she going?

488
00:37:11,654 --> 00:37:15,883
I...I have no idea. She
came over here all upset.

489
00:37:16,684 --> 00:37:20,395
- Is she all right? I mean...
- I don't know.

490
00:37:20,396 --> 00:37:23,774
- What did you do to her?
- Nothing. Nothing.

491
00:37:23,775 --> 00:37:26,360
I asked her what was the matter,
but she wouldn't tell me.

492
00:37:26,361 --> 00:37:29,112
- Well, did you touch her?
- No.

493
00:37:29,113 --> 00:37:31,365
Why was she screaming "don't
touch me" if you didn't touch her?

494
00:37:31,366 --> 00:37:33,241
I wasn't touching her,
okay? I don't know.

495
00:37:33,242 --> 00:37:36,429
I kept asking her and she wouldn't tell
me what was going on. I don't know.

496
00:37:36,955 --> 00:37:38,868
God, I'll talk to her.

497
00:38:11,406 --> 00:38:14,074
The last thing that I
wanted to do was upset you.

498
00:38:14,075 --> 00:38:16,576
That's why I haven't said
anything about this.

499
00:38:16,577 --> 00:38:20,998
Tell me what happened.
I want to know everything.

500
00:38:20,999 --> 00:38:25,085
Um, well, it started my
first week on the job.

501
00:38:25,086 --> 00:38:28,171
The things that he would say.

502
00:38:28,172 --> 00:38:30,090
I thought it was harmless,

503
00:38:30,091 --> 00:38:32,300
but then when I had the
embryo transferred,

504
00:38:32,301 --> 00:38:34,678
he started e-mailing me.

505
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:38,015
I see his e-mails. He
hasn't been writing you.

506
00:38:38,016 --> 00:38:41,685
From his faculty address,
not his personal.

507
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:43,646
Well, what did he say?

508
00:38:43,647 --> 00:38:49,076
Just chatting about the baby,

509
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:51,120
how happy you are.

510
00:38:51,821 --> 00:38:55,533
And then he started
getting romantic.

511
00:38:55,534 --> 00:38:59,119
I told him I didn't think it was
appropriate for him to write those things.

512
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:02,865
So he stopped. And
then a few weeks ago

513
00:39:02,866 --> 00:39:06,869
I got a huge bouquet of red
roses delivered to me.

514
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:08,963
And you're sure they're from him?

515
00:39:09,164 --> 00:39:11,499
The card said, "from Jacob."

516
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,128
And this.

517
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:30,559
He even asked me to meet
him at a hotel last weekend.

518
00:39:32,695 --> 00:39:35,063
I want to see the e-mails.

(BEEP)

520
00:39:39,778 --> 00:39:42,863
Hi, this message is for Jennifer.
My name is Jacob Kelly,

521
00:39:42,864 --> 00:39:45,040
and I'm calling regarding a
letter of recommendation

522
00:39:45,041 --> 00:39:47,334
that you wrote for Kate Randall.

523
00:39:47,835 --> 00:39:50,004
He wrote me about 10 times.

524
00:39:50,605 --> 00:39:54,108
I told him if he didn't knock
it off I was going to tell you.

525
00:39:54,509 --> 00:39:57,385
What were you doing
at the house today?

526
00:39:57,386 --> 00:40:00,514
This morning at school
he asked me to come by.

527
00:40:00,515 --> 00:40:04,893
Allison, I swear he said
that you would be there.

528
00:40:04,894 --> 00:40:07,604
And when I got to your
house, you weren't there.

529
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:11,691
And that is when he
tried to kiss me.

530
00:40:11,692 --> 00:40:15,862
I didn't do any of that.
She is out of her mind.

531
00:40:15,863 --> 00:40:18,031
Then how do you explain this?

532
00:40:18,032 --> 00:40:22,369
Your credit card
statement, roses, $300.

533
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:23,912
I didn't buy anybody flowers.

534
00:40:23,913 --> 00:40:25,539
Lingerie, 450.

535
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:29,084
You spent more on that hotel than
you spent on our entire honeymoon.

536
00:40:29,085 --> 00:40:30,710
Okay, look, she got ahold
of my credit card number.

537
00:40:30,711 --> 00:40:32,896
Oh, God, come on. Don't
treat me like an idiot.

538
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:35,658
- I read the e-mails.
- What e-mails?

539
00:40:35,659 --> 00:40:39,119
From the school website, back
and forth between you and Kate.

540
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:44,024
What? I don't even use that.
Nobody uses that website.

541
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:46,726
Okay? I haven't even checked
my profile in months.

542
00:40:46,727 --> 00:40:49,896
- Kate says all of the teachers use it.
- Okay, well I don't use it.

543
00:40:49,897 --> 00:40:53,900
When I want to talk to my
students, I do it in class.

544
00:40:53,901 --> 00:40:58,238
I...I didn't write any of those.

545
00:40:58,239 --> 00:41:01,074
Yeah, you did. I know
your writing style.

546
00:41:01,075 --> 00:41:03,076
A lot of people know
my writing style.

547
00:41:03,077 --> 00:41:06,746
Do you know how easy it is for a school
employee to hack into my faculty e-mail?

548
00:41:06,747 --> 00:41:08,248
Is that what happened?

549
00:41:08,249 --> 00:41:11,001
I don't know, she's trying to
make me look bad for some reason,

550
00:41:11,002 --> 00:41:14,030
and I had a feeling that I was
wrong about her, but now I'm sure.

551
00:41:18,593 --> 00:41:21,094
I called back her references.

552
00:41:21,095 --> 00:41:23,471
I'm going to talk to somebody
that knows this woman.

553
00:41:23,472 --> 00:41:26,850
Just admit it. You're scared
of being a father, are you?

554
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:30,478
What? That's... That's ridiculous.
So you thought you'd treat yourself

555
00:41:30,479 --> 00:41:32,814
to one final personal
bachelor party

556
00:41:32,815 --> 00:41:34,482
before getting serious
and raising a child.

557
00:41:34,483 --> 00:41:35,859
Would you please just listen
to yourself right now?

558
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:40,280
This is just like you and that old college
girlfriend of yours from five years ago.

559
00:41:40,281 --> 00:41:41,865
First of all, it was
seven years ago,

560
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:43,658
and she wasn't my
girlfriend in college.

561
00:41:43,659 --> 00:41:46,870
You'll never change. It's my fault.

562
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:48,622
It's my fault for trusting you,

563
00:41:48,623 --> 00:41:50,165
but I want you out of this house.

564
00:41:50,166 --> 00:41:52,326
- Ali, wait a second.
- You go stay in a hotel.

565
00:41:52,327 --> 00:41:55,881
- Apparently you can afford it.
- Ali, come on.

00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:54,868
you killed my girlfriend.

578

could read my short story.

somebody to punch you in the face,

that all by yourself?

She's doing this to frame me.

688
00:53:13,515 --> 00:53:17,643
Beth, come on.

689
00:53:17,644 --> 00:53:19,645
You know what, Shawn?

690
00:53:19,646 --> 00:53:22,815
Go ahead and put that under my desk,
because I'm going to be right back.

691
00:53:22,816 --> 00:53:25,816
And, Valerie, yes, I would be very
happy to read your short story.

692
00:53:30,324 --> 00:53:34,326
Yeah, I left you a message regarding a
reference that you wrote for Kate Randall.

693
00:53:34,327 --> 00:53:35,261
Uh-huh.

694
00:53:35,362 --> 00:53:37,330
Yes, I need to talk to one
of Kate's family members

695
00:53:37,331 --> 00:53:40,333
or anybody that's known
Kate her whole life.

696
00:53:40,334 --> 00:53:41,918
I'd start with her dad's business.

697
00:53:41,919 --> 00:53:44,202
- Okay, her father's name is Edward?
- Yes.

698
00:53:44,203 --> 00:53:46,722
Edward Randall. And, I'm sorry,
what was the name of his company?

699
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:48,341
It was a shipping company.

700
00:53:48,342 --> 00:53:50,843
I was Ed Randall's
secretary for ten years.

701
00:53:50,844 --> 00:53:52,678
When he died, new
management took over.

702
00:53:52,679 --> 00:53:56,098
I was the first person they let go.
Luckily I found another job.

703
00:53:56,099 --> 00:53:59,435
Did you by any chance
know his daughter, Kate?

704
00:53:59,436 --> 00:54:01,354
You mean, Katherine? Of course.

705
00:54:01,355 --> 00:54:03,072
Ed talked about her
all the time. Why?

706
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:05,992
Well, my wife and I hired
her to be our surrogate,

707
00:54:06,193 --> 00:54:10,404
and now she's just causing all sorts of
trouble, and I want to go to the police,

708
00:54:10,405 --> 00:54:12,531
but I don't have... I don't have
anything concrete to tell them.

709
00:54:12,532 --> 00:54:15,076
Sounds familiar. Katherine
was a nightmare.

710
00:54:15,077 --> 00:54:18,037
She made her father so angry he quit
communicating with her entirely.

711
00:54:18,038 --> 00:54:19,121
Why?

712
00:54:19,122 --> 00:54:21,374
Why? Are you kidding?

713
00:54:21,375 --> 00:54:23,542
The baby.

714
00:54:23,543 --> 00:54:26,545
Because she gave the
baby up for adoption?

715
00:54:26,546 --> 00:54:29,423
Adoption? Is that
what she's saying?

716
00:54:29,424 --> 00:54:31,759
Her baby died.

717
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,469
She said it was crib death.

718
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:36,764
But I could tell that the way Edward
talked about it he didn't believe her.

719
00:54:36,765 --> 00:54:39,225
And then there was all that
business with the will

720
00:54:39,226 --> 00:54:41,394
and his estate and the lawyers.

721
00:54:41,395 --> 00:54:45,064
She screwed over
everybody, me included.

722
00:54:45,065 --> 00:54:48,317
Would you be willing to
tell this story to my wife?

723
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:52,238
All right, yes. Thank you.

724
00:54:52,239 --> 00:54:55,324
- So you believe me now?
- No, she's just bitter.

725
00:54:55,325 --> 00:54:56,951
I mean, Kate got all of
her father's inheritance,

726
00:54:56,952 --> 00:54:59,078
and this secretary lady
didn't get anything.

727
00:54:59,079 --> 00:55:01,747
What do I have to do
to convince you, Ali?

728
00:55:01,748 --> 00:55:03,666
Why would Kate kill her own baby?

729
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:05,292
It just... It doesn't
make any sense.

730
00:55:05,293 --> 00:55:07,753
Why would she beat herself
up to get me fired?

731
00:55:07,754 --> 00:55:09,588
None of what she's
doing makes any sense.

732
00:55:09,589 --> 00:55:11,674
And that's not the
only thing, okay?

733
00:55:11,675 --> 00:55:13,759
Last night I got a phone
call from a guy named Matt,

734
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,261
said he was Remy's boyfriend.

735
00:55:15,262 --> 00:55:17,930
Said he had information
about our surrogate,

736
00:55:17,931 --> 00:55:19,306
and then the line went dead.

737
00:55:19,307 --> 00:55:21,434
I called him back and
there was no answer.

738
00:55:21,435 --> 00:55:22,977
So go to the police.

739
00:55:22,978 --> 00:55:25,521
And tell them what?
What proof do I have?

740
00:55:25,522 --> 00:55:29,316
I have nothing.

741
00:55:29,317 --> 00:55:32,445
Ali, just look at me please.

742
00:55:32,446 --> 00:55:34,447
Just look at me.

743
00:55:34,448 --> 00:55:39,326
I'm your husband, okay?

744
00:55:39,327 --> 00:55:41,871
I'm the guy that you fell
in love with 16 years ago.

745
00:55:41,872 --> 00:55:44,373
I'm the guy that still
loves you right now

746
00:55:44,374 --> 00:55:47,877
no matter how much you
hate me in this moment.

747
00:55:47,878 --> 00:55:49,825
Why won't you believe me?

748
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:05,758
JACOB: Congratulations.

749
00:56:14,404 --> 00:56:19,075
You took away most
of it, didn't you?

750
00:56:19,076 --> 00:56:22,912
My wife, my job.

751
00:56:22,913 --> 00:56:24,830
I suppose what's next
is you call the cops

752
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:29,585
and you take away
my freedom, but...

753
00:56:29,586 --> 00:56:35,382
Before you do that, I just
have one little request.

754
00:56:35,383 --> 00:56:40,387
I want to know why.

755
00:56:40,388 --> 00:56:43,182
Please. Why?

756
00:56:43,183 --> 00:56:44,767
Please.

757
00:56:44,768 --> 00:56:47,170
I read BlackBerry Winter
over a hundred times.

758
00:56:48,605 --> 00:56:51,357
It changed my life.

759
00:56:51,358 --> 00:56:54,693
Jacob, it changed everything.

760
00:56:54,694 --> 00:56:56,862
And the first time I
saw you on television,

761
00:56:56,863 --> 00:56:58,765
I knew you were my soul mate.

762
00:57:02,869 --> 00:57:06,288
Alexandria.

763
00:57:06,289 --> 00:57:11,710
Yes. That's my pen name.

764
00:57:11,711 --> 00:57:13,954
I'm going to show you something.

765
00:57:42,242 --> 00:57:46,620
KATE: I have been waiting
for this moment for so long.

766
00:57:46,621 --> 00:57:49,790
I knew that one day you would come

767
00:57:49,791 --> 00:57:52,910
and you would be
standing right there.

768
00:57:55,505 --> 00:57:59,175
I love you.

769
00:57:59,176 --> 00:58:02,595
I wrote you every two days
for six years straight.

770
00:58:02,596 --> 00:58:05,264
Even when the letters came back,

771
00:58:05,265 --> 00:58:07,016
I didn't lose hope that some day...

772
00:58:07,017 --> 00:58:09,643
Some day you would write me back.

773
00:58:09,644 --> 00:58:15,274
When my father died,
I had to find you.

774
00:58:15,275 --> 00:58:16,483
I got a job at Whittendale

775
00:58:16,484 --> 00:58:18,360
just so I could be close to you.

776
00:58:18,361 --> 00:58:20,321
I'm sorry I had to get
you in so much trouble,

777
00:58:20,322 --> 00:58:23,157
but it was the only way
for us to be together.

778
00:58:23,158 --> 00:58:25,784
Jacob, you're free.

779
00:58:25,785 --> 00:58:31,498
Allison left you. Besides,
she can't give you babies.

780
00:58:31,499 --> 00:58:34,793
I can.

781
00:58:34,794 --> 00:58:37,129
And you don't have
to teach anymore.

782
00:58:37,130 --> 00:58:39,798
I liberated you from
that awful job.

783
00:58:39,799 --> 00:58:42,635
We can live together in
my father's mansion.

784
00:58:42,636 --> 00:58:44,970
It's up in the mountains.

785
00:58:44,971 --> 00:58:49,975
It's so far away,
nobody will bother us.

786
00:58:49,976 --> 00:58:55,648
Jacob, we can have this
baby that I'm carrying,

787
00:58:55,649 --> 00:59:01,601
and then at night we
can make our own.

788
00:59:15,252 --> 00:59:17,006
ALLISON: Hi, Kate.

789
00:59:21,007 --> 00:59:25,528
I'd punch you in the nose,
but I'm afraid you'd enjoy it.

790
00:59:25,929 --> 00:59:29,932
What actually happened to Remy?

791
00:59:29,933 --> 00:59:33,894
Why did her boyfriend call Jacob?

792
00:59:33,895 --> 00:59:39,517
Maybe she didn't accidentally
fall from that building?

793
00:59:41,861 --> 00:59:44,113
I think we need to
talk to the cops.

794
00:59:44,114 --> 00:59:45,281
No.

795
00:59:45,282 --> 00:59:47,358
No.

796
00:59:50,203 --> 00:59:52,871
If you call the police,
I will kill this baby.

797
00:59:52,872 --> 00:59:55,207
Okay. Okay.

798
00:59:55,208 --> 00:59:57,793
If you try to trick me
or have me arrested,

799
00:59:57,794 --> 01:00:01,714
I don't care. I'll
drink rat poison.

800
01:00:01,715 --> 01:00:03,299
I'll take a coat hanger to it.

801
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:04,300
- Kate.
- I don't care.

802
01:00:04,301 --> 01:00:05,426
I will do whatever it takes,

803
01:00:05,427 --> 01:00:07,886
but I will not let this baby live.

804
01:00:07,887 --> 01:00:11,473
You would actually kill
yourself and my child?

805
01:00:11,474 --> 01:00:14,476
If I can't get Jacob
Kelly to love me,

806
01:00:14,477 --> 01:00:18,897
what is the point of living?

807
01:00:18,898 --> 01:00:21,734
Oh, Kate, honey, you need help.

808
01:00:21,735 --> 01:00:26,238
I don't need anyone's help!

809
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:27,406
Okay.

810
01:00:27,407 --> 01:00:30,075
Get out of my house.

811
01:00:30,076 --> 01:00:31,744
Leave!

812
01:00:31,745 --> 01:00:34,147
Go!

813
01:00:46,468 --> 01:00:49,595
Well, what happens if we
turn her into the police?

814
01:00:49,596 --> 01:00:51,138
Well, they'll take
her into custody,

815
01:00:51,139 --> 01:00:53,807
but they can't watch
her 24 hours a day.

816
01:00:53,808 --> 01:00:56,769
She can still make good on
her threat to harm the baby,

817
01:00:56,770 --> 01:00:58,604
even in jail.

818
01:00:58,605 --> 01:01:01,690
Are you saying there's
nothing that we can do?

819
01:01:01,691 --> 01:01:05,778
Look, definitely gather as much
of a paper trail as you can,

820
01:01:05,779 --> 01:01:08,781
credit card statements,
e-mails, all of that.

821
01:01:08,782 --> 01:01:13,118
It'll help us if we decide
to sue her later.

822
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:14,661
I'm sorry.

823
01:01:14,662 --> 01:01:16,872
But I think the only
options you have

824
01:01:16,873 --> 01:01:20,292
are to go to the police and
accept the consequences,

825
01:01:20,293 --> 01:01:23,697
or you can try to work
something out with her.

826
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:38,811
You okay?

827
01:01:38,812 --> 01:01:43,565
We could just do what she wants.

828
01:01:43,566 --> 01:01:44,983
Hmm?

829
01:01:44,984 --> 01:01:48,570
She's in love with you, so...

830
01:01:48,571 --> 01:01:52,991
We could just play along with it.

831
01:01:52,992 --> 01:01:56,829
Until she delivers.

832
01:01:56,830 --> 01:01:59,039
Ali, it's, like, three
in the morning.

833
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:01,375
No, listen to me. You could...

834
01:02:01,376 --> 01:02:05,170
You could go live with her
and I could follow you

835
01:02:05,171 --> 01:02:09,508
and stay in a camper or
rent a cabin or something

836
01:02:09,509 --> 01:02:12,428
and... and then when
she gives birth

837
01:02:12,429 --> 01:02:16,014
we could take the
baby from her and...

838
01:02:16,015 --> 01:02:18,183
And we turn her in to the cops.

839
01:02:18,184 --> 01:02:20,018
Right?

840
01:02:20,019 --> 01:02:23,689
You expect me to go live with her?

841
01:02:23,690 --> 01:02:26,733
Because a couple of days ago

842
01:02:26,734 --> 01:02:28,444
you were ready to divorce me

843
01:02:28,445 --> 01:02:30,863
because you thought I
was cheating on you.

844
01:02:30,864 --> 01:02:33,031
I don't like the idea,

845
01:02:33,032 --> 01:02:37,244
but I'm willing to, I don't know,

846
01:02:37,245 --> 01:02:42,791
make the sacrifice in
order to save our child.

847
01:02:42,792 --> 01:02:44,209
Your sacrifice?

848
01:02:44,210 --> 01:02:45,711
I hate this woman.

849
01:02:45,712 --> 01:02:47,880
We cannot let her kill our baby.

850
01:02:47,881 --> 01:02:49,381
We have to keep tabs on her.

851
01:02:49,382 --> 01:02:53,912
One of us has to be
watching her 24/7.

852
01:02:55,597 --> 01:02:58,796
(DOORBELL RINGS)

853
01:03:04,731 --> 01:03:06,816
What are you doing here?

854
01:03:08,017 --> 01:03:09,813
I'm yours.

855
01:03:13,114 --> 01:03:14,949
I don't believe you.

856
01:03:16,150 --> 01:03:18,844
Allison is done with me.

857
01:03:19,245 --> 01:03:22,998
She blames me for bringing
you into our lives.

858
01:03:22,999 --> 01:03:24,833
Oh, yeah?

859
01:03:24,834 --> 01:03:27,169
You're carrying the
only viable embryo,

860
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:32,925
taking away her last chance of becoming
a mother, and I let you do it.

861
01:03:32,926 --> 01:03:36,595
She's never going to forgive me.

862
01:03:36,596 --> 01:03:39,265
You're lying.

863
01:03:40,266 --> 01:03:42,994
I'm here, aren't I?

864
01:03:50,477 --> 01:03:53,989
Do you think that you could love
me after everything I've done?

865
01:03:55,690 --> 01:03:57,793
I'll try.

866
01:04:06,626 --> 01:04:08,428
Try now.

867
01:04:10,129 --> 01:04:13,674
There'll be plenty of
time for that later.

868
01:04:51,671 --> 01:04:53,883
Can I borrow your cell phone?

869
01:04:56,384 --> 01:04:57,860
What for?

870
01:04:57,861 --> 01:04:59,689
Please, baby?

871
01:05:17,414 --> 01:05:19,441
We only need mine.

872
01:05:24,321 --> 01:05:29,274
I've prepared a nursery and a playroom
for the baby. It's just down the hall.

873
01:05:29,375 --> 01:05:31,543
The Internet and landline
have been disconnected too,

874
01:05:31,544 --> 01:05:34,880
so you can concentrate on your
writing and we can be left alone.

875
01:05:34,881 --> 01:05:37,233
Sometimes I need the
Internet to do research.

876
01:05:37,234 --> 01:05:40,587
My father has a huge
library. You can use that.

877
01:05:41,888 --> 01:05:44,709
You've certainly
thought of everything.

878
01:05:47,810 --> 01:05:50,053
There's something else
I want to show you.

879
01:06:27,934 --> 01:06:30,462
This is for you.

880
01:07:01,134 --> 01:07:03,957
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

881
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:10,517
How's the writing going?

882
01:07:10,518 --> 01:07:12,477
Good.

883
01:07:12,478 --> 01:07:14,676
Can I read some pages?

884
01:07:16,899 --> 01:07:19,301
Sure.

885
01:07:58,858 --> 01:08:01,526
I think the woman should live.

886
01:08:01,527 --> 01:08:04,905
Oh, oh, I like that she dies.

887
01:08:04,906 --> 01:08:07,783
Yeah, but this scene is so violent.

888
01:08:07,784 --> 01:08:09,451
I like that it's violent.

889
01:08:09,452 --> 01:08:13,121
In fact, I was going to make her death
even more violent on my next pass.

890
01:08:13,122 --> 01:08:14,774
Well...

891
01:08:16,375 --> 01:08:20,921
I don't believe your
main character.

892
01:08:20,922 --> 01:08:22,995
Okay.

893
01:08:23,716 --> 01:08:26,586
What don't you believe?

894
01:08:27,887 --> 01:08:29,890
What if...

895
01:08:31,191 --> 01:08:32,700
What if...

896
01:08:33,526 --> 01:08:37,965
she were 17 years old,
senior in high school.

897
01:08:39,666 --> 01:08:42,042
No, she's 21.

898
01:08:42,043 --> 01:08:45,045
She's 17. She's
practically a child.

899
01:08:45,146 --> 01:08:46,623
Come here, sweetheart.

900
01:08:47,324 --> 01:08:50,159
What if her father's friend,

901
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:53,787
a business partner, let's say,

902
01:08:54,088 --> 01:08:56,465
wanted her to be his lover?

903
01:08:56,466 --> 01:08:58,167
And this is Tony.

904
01:08:58,168 --> 01:08:59,685
Heard so much about you, Katherine.

905
01:08:59,686 --> 01:09:03,922
KATE: One day her dad leaves
her alone with this friend

906
01:09:03,923 --> 01:09:06,508
and the friend forces her
to have sex with him.

907
01:09:07,009 --> 01:09:10,595
- No, Tony stop.
- So he rapes her.

908
01:09:10,596 --> 01:09:14,933
Yeah, he rapes her.

909
01:09:14,934 --> 01:09:16,810
Good girl.

910
01:09:16,811 --> 01:09:18,880
Gets her pregnant.

911
01:09:19,481 --> 01:09:23,350
She wants an abortion,
but daddy says no.

912
01:09:23,651 --> 01:09:26,027
He says that if she
gets an abortion,

913
01:09:26,028 --> 01:09:28,989
he will write her out
of the family fortune.

914
01:09:28,990 --> 01:09:31,992
- You can't do that to me.
- I'm doing it.

915
01:09:31,993 --> 01:09:35,370
So she carries the baby.

916
01:09:35,371 --> 01:09:39,332
For nine incredibly painful months,

917
01:09:39,333 --> 01:09:42,961
thinking, of course,
that she could just

918
01:09:42,962 --> 01:09:46,842
give the baby up for adoption
and be done with all this.

919
01:09:48,843 --> 01:09:50,803
But, no.

920
01:09:51,804 --> 01:09:54,723
Daddy wants her to keep the baby,

921
01:09:54,724 --> 01:09:57,726
wants her to live
with his best friend.

922
01:09:57,727 --> 01:09:59,811
Look, this is not the
end of the world.

923
01:09:59,812 --> 01:10:01,521
It is for me.

924
01:10:01,522 --> 01:10:04,482
KATE:
You see, it's a business deal.

925
01:10:04,483 --> 01:10:10,322
In her father's eyes, she's
just a piece of property

926
01:10:10,323 --> 01:10:15,854
to be traded for a majority
share in a competing company.

927
01:10:16,829 --> 01:10:19,998
So she kills the baby.

928
01:10:19,999 --> 01:10:22,709
She has to.

929
01:10:22,710 --> 01:10:24,878
It's the only thing that she can do

930
01:10:24,879 --> 01:10:29,674
to get herself out of the
situation, to be free.

931
01:10:29,675 --> 01:10:33,178
When daddy looks into the crib,

932
01:10:33,179 --> 01:10:35,388
he sees his grandchild dead.

933
01:10:35,389 --> 01:10:36,431
He freaks out.

934
01:10:36,432 --> 01:10:38,558
Kate, you come here right now.

935
01:10:38,559 --> 01:10:41,686
He tries to kill the
main character.

936
01:10:41,687 --> 01:10:44,356
Ooh!

937
01:10:44,357 --> 01:10:46,441
But she gets away.

938
01:10:46,442 --> 01:10:49,694
Daddy cuts her out of the
will, but she's smart.

939
01:10:49,695 --> 01:10:53,531
On the night of his death,

940
01:10:53,532 --> 01:10:58,870
she gets a hold of the one
executed copy of the new will.

941
01:10:58,871 --> 01:11:03,541
And she shreds it.

942
01:11:03,542 --> 01:11:06,419
Daddy's lawyers have to
resort to the old will,

943
01:11:06,420 --> 01:11:09,756
where she gets it all.

944
01:11:09,757 --> 01:11:12,550
In the end, she wins.

945
01:11:12,551 --> 01:11:15,887
Big.

946
01:11:15,888 --> 01:11:21,135
That, Mr. Kelly, is a great story.

947
01:11:22,812 --> 01:11:25,806
And I want you to write it.

948
01:12:23,539 --> 01:12:28,661
"My dearest Allison, I can't
tell you how much I miss you."

949
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:38,011
"Knowing that you're nearby
helps me get through this.

950
01:12:38,012 --> 01:12:40,138
"I think of you every
waking moment,

951
01:12:40,139 --> 01:12:43,475
"and I can't wait
until this is over.

952
01:12:43,476 --> 01:12:46,227
"I adore you so much,

953
01:12:46,228 --> 01:12:51,232
"even this writer
can't find the words.

954
01:12:51,233 --> 01:12:53,806
Love, Jacob."

955
01:13:01,202 --> 01:13:07,082
ALLISON: "Dear sexy world-famous
author whom I love so very much,

956
01:13:07,083 --> 01:13:11,711

"As for me, I'm doing okay.

01:13:20,721 --> 01:13:23,848
"I'm mostly worried about you.

(KNOCK AT DOOR)

963
01:13:30,898 --> 01:13:36,027
KATE:
Jacob, come out of there. Jacob.

964
01:13:36,028 --> 01:13:37,362
Where is it?

965
01:13:37,363 --> 01:13:39,030
JACOB: Where's what?

966
01:13:39,031 --> 01:13:43,034
The story I told you, about
the 17-year-old girl?

967
01:13:43,035 --> 01:13:45,453
I told you to write it, and
you haven't even started.

968
01:13:45,454 --> 01:13:47,372
I will. Relax.

969
01:13:47,373 --> 01:13:48,706
What's wrong?

970
01:13:48,707 --> 01:13:50,291
You don't think it's a good story?

971
01:13:50,292 --> 01:13:51,876
I think it's a sad story.

972
01:13:51,877 --> 01:13:56,047
Then why haven't you
started to write it?

973
01:13:56,048 --> 01:14:01,553
Why haven't you started writing it?

974
01:14:01,554 --> 01:14:02,720
Answer me.

975
01:14:02,721 --> 01:14:04,472
Because it's not my story.

976
01:14:04,473 --> 01:14:06,474
It's your story, and
it's true, isn't it?

977
01:14:06,475 --> 01:14:08,268
No, I made it up.

978
01:14:08,269 --> 01:14:12,272
I talked to your dad's
secretary, Kate.

979
01:14:12,273 --> 01:14:15,483
You killed your baby.

980
01:14:15,484 --> 01:14:17,819
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

981
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:19,779
You know you did.

982
01:14:19,780 --> 01:14:21,489
Why?

983
01:14:21,490 --> 01:14:22,907
Why did you do it?

984
01:14:22,908 --> 01:14:25,118
Because that man raped me.

985
01:14:25,119 --> 01:14:26,911
And my father forced
me to keep the baby.

986
01:14:26,912 --> 01:14:29,080
You could have walked away, Kate.

987
01:14:29,081 --> 01:14:31,749
You didn't have to kill that child.

988
01:14:31,750 --> 01:14:35,587
But you did because you
hated your father,

989
01:14:35,588 --> 01:14:38,506
and now you're feeling guilty about it,
so you want me to write your story

990
01:14:38,507 --> 01:14:40,967
and make you look like a hero,
but I'm not going to do that!

991
01:14:40,968 --> 01:14:42,510
Because you're not a hero.

992
01:14:42,511 --> 01:14:45,138
You're a coward, and
you're a murderer!

993
01:14:45,139 --> 01:14:48,683
Please wait. I need you.

994
01:14:48,684 --> 01:14:51,102
I need you to write my story.

995
01:14:51,103 --> 01:14:53,771
No one will listen to me.

996
01:14:53,772 --> 01:14:55,690
But they'll listen to you.

997
01:14:55,691 --> 01:14:57,968
They will listen to Jacob Kelly.

998
01:15:02,781 --> 01:15:05,950
Do what I say,

999
01:15:05,951 --> 01:15:09,162
or you know exactly what I will do.

1000
01:15:09,163 --> 01:15:14,945
Ah, yes, that's the girl I love.

1001
01:15:26,472 --> 01:15:31,476
What are you doing?

1002
01:15:31,477 --> 01:15:34,187
What are you doing?

1003
01:15:34,188 --> 01:15:39,560
Making you famous.

1004
01:15:48,327 --> 01:15:49,744
Where are you going?

1005
01:15:49,745 --> 01:15:52,330
I'm just taking out the trash.

1006
01:15:52,331 --> 01:15:55,541
It's not very full. Can't
it wait until tomorrow?

1007
01:15:55,542 --> 01:15:57,001
Well it's such a nice house.

1008
01:15:57,002 --> 01:16:00,046
- I'm just trying to keep it clean.
- Okay, well, I'll come with you.

1009
01:16:00,047 --> 01:16:02,340
It's beautiful weather.
Let me grab my shoes.

1010
01:16:02,341 --> 01:16:05,176
No, it's just going to take a second. And
I finished the first chapter, so I want...

1011
01:16:05,177 --> 01:16:09,185
- I want to come back and show you.
- Okay, great.

1012
01:17:41,982 --> 01:17:44,150
Okay, I finished the first chapter.

1013
01:17:44,151 --> 01:17:46,519
You want to read it?

1014
01:17:49,031 --> 01:17:51,491
I made the changes
that you suggested,

1015
01:17:51,492 --> 01:17:55,066
and I actually think that
you're really going to love it.

1016
01:18:27,694 --> 01:18:30,405
Kate, you've got to
unlock this right now.

1017
01:18:30,406 --> 01:18:32,156
Why?

1018
01:18:32,157 --> 01:18:33,991
(SCREAMS)

1019
01:18:33,992 --> 01:18:35,368
You... are you okay?

1020
01:18:35,369 --> 01:18:36,577
What's wrong? What's wrong?

1021
01:18:36,578 --> 01:18:40,873
So you can write her
more love letters?

1022
01:18:40,874 --> 01:18:43,000
"My dearest Allison,

1023
01:18:43,001 --> 01:18:45,002
"the longer I am away from you,

1024
01:18:45,003 --> 01:18:47,880
the more I realize how
much you mean to me."

1025
01:18:47,881 --> 01:18:50,341
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1026
01:18:50,342 --> 01:18:53,594
This is the worst thing
you have ever written.

1027
01:18:53,595 --> 01:18:55,888
- Okay.
- You know why?

1028
01:18:55,889 --> 01:18:59,100
'Cause it's a lie.

1029
01:18:59,101 --> 01:19:01,269
She's still controlling you, Jacob.

1030
01:19:01,270 --> 01:19:05,231
She's forcing you to write these letters
and hide them out in the wall, isn't she?

1031
01:19:05,232 --> 01:19:06,899
You need to calm down.

1032
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:10,111
You need to realize you
don't love her anymore.

1033
01:19:10,112 --> 01:19:12,355
