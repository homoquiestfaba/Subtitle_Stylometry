00:49:31,533 --> 00:49:32,752
Are you a cop?

563
00:49:32,882 --> 00:49:34,101
Is there a problem?

564
00:49:34,232 --> 00:49:36,451
Yeah, I'm trying
to get to Baker.

565
00:49:36,582 --> 00:49:39,280
Just take this road northwest about three hours.

566
00:49:39,411 --> 00:49:41,021
You'll get there fine.

567
00:49:41,152 --> 00:49:43,676
So you're saying this road right here, just three hours?

568
00:49:43,806 --> 00:49:46,809
Couldn't be simpler
even if it was.

569
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:47,723
Have a nice day.

570
00:49:47,854 --> 00:49:49,247
Drive safely.

571
00:49:49,377 --> 00:49:50,596
Yeah, I have this map.

572
00:49:50,726 --> 00:49:52,206
I'm just hell with
directions, that's all.

573
00:49:55,818 --> 00:49:59,083
Who the fuck are you?

574
00:49:59,213 --> 00:50:02,260
The person whose
black bag you have.

575
00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:04,827
I don't have it.

576
00:50:04,958 --> 00:50:07,700
Give me your service revolver.

577
00:50:07,830 --> 00:50:08,570
Slowly.

578
00:50:17,275 --> 00:50:18,580
Better all be there.

579
00:50:22,106 --> 00:50:24,325
Just like I found it.

580
00:50:24,456 --> 00:50:25,544
[clank]

581
00:50:25,674 --> 00:50:26,458
What is that?

582
00:50:26,588 --> 00:50:27,372
Nothing.

583
00:50:27,502 --> 00:50:28,547
Open the door.

584
00:50:28,677 --> 00:50:30,244
Hey, dumbo, open
the fucking door.

585
00:50:30,375 --> 00:50:33,639
Open the fucking door.

586
00:50:33,769 --> 00:50:37,338
Jesus Christ, what
are you doing?

587
00:50:37,469 --> 00:50:38,513
Fuck, uncuff her.

588
00:50:38,644 --> 00:50:39,601
Fuck you.
THE HITMAN: Fuck you!

589
00:50:39,732 --> 00:50:40,515
Unlock her.

590
00:50:40,646 --> 00:50:41,864
Fuck you.

591
00:50:41,995 --> 00:50:42,822
THE HITMAN: Unlock her.

592
00:50:42,952 --> 00:50:44,824
THE COP: Fuck you.

593
00:50:44,954 --> 00:50:45,781
Let's go.

594
00:50:48,915 --> 00:50:51,874
Are you OK?

595
00:50:52,005 --> 00:50:52,745
Just relax.

596
00:50:56,444 --> 00:50:59,447
I'll get you next time.

597
00:50:59,578 --> 00:51:01,014
You are in trouble, asshole.

598
00:51:01,145 --> 00:51:02,929
Just take the bag
and get outta here.

599
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,626
Hand it to me.

600
00:51:04,757 --> 00:51:07,238
Give me the fucking
bag, nice and slow.

601
00:51:07,368 --> 00:51:09,501
Going slow.

602
00:51:09,631 --> 00:51:10,806
Hey, the bag.

603
00:51:14,332 --> 00:51:16,029
Put it down.

604
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,639
It's all yours.
[gunshot]

605
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:18,553
Jesus!

606
00:51:18,684 --> 00:51:20,381
Drop the guns!

607
00:51:20,512 --> 00:51:21,643
Drop both of them!

608
00:51:24,472 --> 00:51:28,259
You two, you left me for
dead, but I'm Lazarus.

609
00:51:28,389 --> 00:51:30,522
You shot me, you asshole.

610
00:51:30,652 --> 00:51:31,827
You robbed me.

611
00:51:31,958 --> 00:51:33,916
And you, you left me to die.

612
00:51:34,047 --> 00:51:35,135
You'd have done
the same thing.

613
00:51:35,266 --> 00:51:36,223
Oh, yeah?

614
00:51:36,354 --> 00:51:37,268
Maybe I will.

615
00:51:37,398 --> 00:51:39,096
Maybe I will do the same thing.

616
00:51:39,226 --> 00:51:42,621
I can't jack off
anymore because of you.

617
00:51:42,751 --> 00:51:43,883
Sorry.

618
00:51:44,013 --> 00:51:45,232
You don't care.

619
00:51:45,363 --> 00:51:46,451
I do care.

620
00:51:46,581 --> 00:51:47,626
THE SECURITY GUARD:
No, you don't!

621
00:51:47,756 --> 00:51:49,106
THE COP: Look,
just take the bag.

622
00:51:49,236 --> 00:51:50,716
- THE SECURITY GUARD:
- Don't tell me what to do!

623
00:51:50,846 --> 00:51:52,021
Hey, take it easy.

624
00:51:52,152 --> 00:51:53,980
I am the one who
is in charge here.

625
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:55,329
Not you.
Me.

626
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:56,156
Finally.

627
00:51:59,464 --> 00:52:00,334
[engine starting]

628
00:52:00,465 --> 00:52:01,814
Hey!

629
00:52:01,944 --> 00:52:03,337
Hey, that's my car.

630
00:52:03,468 --> 00:52:04,295
My car.

631
00:52:10,475 --> 00:52:12,825
Well, now, this
is interesting.

632
00:52:12,955 --> 00:52:13,826
Drop your weapons.

633
00:52:13,956 --> 00:52:15,088
I got you both.

634
00:52:15,219 --> 00:52:16,002
We got you covered,
so drop the gun.

635
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:17,525
- Drop it!
- Drop them!

636
00:52:17,656 --> 00:52:18,439
I ain't going anywhere.

637
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:19,527
Me neither.

638
00:52:19,658 --> 00:52:20,354
Drop the fucking gun!
- Yeah!

639
00:52:20,485 --> 00:52:21,225
Drop it!

640
00:52:21,355 --> 00:52:22,269
We may be here a while.

641
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:23,488
Or I could just shoot you.

642
00:52:23,618 --> 00:52:24,706
I'll shoot the two of you!

643
00:52:27,492 --> 00:52:29,015
Shoot him.

644
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:29,929
You could do it.

645
00:52:30,059 --> 00:52:30,930
Shoot him, limp dick.

646
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:32,801
Then you're gonna shoot me.

647
00:52:32,932 --> 00:52:33,715
No, I won't.

648
00:52:37,676 --> 00:52:40,548
Just relax.

649
00:52:40,679 --> 00:52:41,549
Don't shoot me, quick draw.

650
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:44,030
Watch me.

651
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:45,118
Watch me.

652
00:52:45,249 --> 00:52:46,989
Listen, I'm gonna put the bag...

653
00:52:50,036 --> 00:52:52,473
right here, OK?

654
00:52:52,604 --> 00:52:56,956
Now just back up over there,and I'm gonna back over here.

655
00:52:57,086 --> 00:52:58,262
Back up.

656
00:52:58,392 --> 00:53:04,093
And whoever wants
the bag can have it.

657
00:53:04,224 --> 00:53:05,791
OK?

658
00:53:05,921 --> 00:53:09,011
And whoever wants to shoot somebody, knock yourself out.

659
00:53:09,142 --> 00:53:09,969
What the fuck?

660
00:53:19,631 --> 00:53:20,458
Get lost.

661
00:53:33,601 --> 00:53:35,429
[sigh]

662
00:53:37,039 --> 00:53:37,910
Fucking amateurs.

663
00:54:03,936 --> 00:54:05,198
How you doing?

664
00:54:05,329 --> 00:54:06,504
Just fine.

665
00:54:06,634 --> 00:54:09,594
Just, uh... taking
in the sights here.

666
00:54:09,724 --> 00:54:11,683
Sure is pretty, ain't it?

667
00:54:11,813 --> 00:54:12,553
Sure is.

668
00:54:18,342 --> 00:54:21,258
Now that's an odd
place for a suitcase.

669
00:54:21,388 --> 00:54:23,738
Yeah, I noticed that.

670
00:54:23,869 --> 00:54:26,611
Bag just like that one turned up missing from the bus depot.

671
00:54:26,741 --> 00:54:27,481
Stolen, frankly.

672
00:54:32,747 --> 00:54:36,185
That looks like it right there.

673
00:54:36,316 --> 00:54:40,451
I wonder what all
the fuss is about.

674
00:54:40,581 --> 00:54:43,062
Sheriff, there's something I have to tell you.

675
00:54:43,192 --> 00:54:43,932
Oh, yeah?

676
00:54:47,153 --> 00:54:48,937
That bag was right
there when I pulled up.

677
00:54:52,114 --> 00:54:56,423
He's trying to pull one on me.

678
00:54:56,554 --> 00:54:57,903
See you around.

679
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:15,312
[train whistle]

680
00:56:02,271 --> 00:56:05,100
I'm caught in the middle.

681
00:56:05,231 --> 00:56:10,628
If I am, so are you.

682
00:56:10,758 --> 00:56:11,890
Found the bag.

683
00:56:14,675 --> 00:56:17,286
You wanna explain now?

684
00:56:17,417 --> 00:56:19,071
Can I talk to a lawyer first?

685
00:56:22,814 --> 00:56:25,991
You don't need a lawyer, son.

686
00:56:26,121 --> 00:56:28,210
You need a library card.

687
00:56:28,341 --> 00:56:29,211
Come on.

688
00:56:50,755 --> 00:56:52,583
What the fuck are
you doing out here?

689
00:57:07,685 --> 00:57:09,034
How you doing?

690
00:57:09,164 --> 00:57:10,296
I'm a little bit lost here.

691
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:13,342
I'm trying to find Baker.

692
00:57:13,473 --> 00:57:15,736
Baker, uh... let's see.

693
00:57:15,867 --> 00:57:17,999
You from around here?

694
00:57:18,130 --> 00:57:19,479
[shout]

695
00:57:20,611 --> 00:57:21,438
Yeah!

696
00:57:21,568 --> 00:57:23,918
You, over here.

697
00:57:24,049 --> 00:57:27,487
I know this asshole isn't asking you directions to Baker, is he?

698
00:57:27,618 --> 00:57:28,836
Give me your gun.

699
00:57:28,967 --> 00:57:30,534
Yeah, slow poke.

700
00:57:30,664 --> 00:57:33,145
Give me the keys.

701
00:57:33,275 --> 00:57:36,365
And those stupid glasses,take those stupid glasses off.

702
00:57:36,496 --> 00:57:37,889
Let me see your face.

703
00:57:38,019 --> 00:57:41,022
Yeah, blue eyes, you a fucking mystery man, huh?

704
00:57:41,153 --> 00:57:42,197
Asshole.

705
00:57:42,328 --> 00:57:44,243
Let's go.

706
00:57:44,373 --> 00:57:47,376
Don't... don't...
don't you resist me.

707
00:57:47,507 --> 00:57:49,422
I like men.

708
00:57:49,553 --> 00:57:51,424
I like women.

709
00:57:51,555 --> 00:57:54,253
I like them all.

710
00:57:54,383 --> 00:57:57,561
I'm avant-garde like that.

711
00:57:57,691 --> 00:57:59,301
Fuck you.

712
00:57:59,432 --> 00:58:00,781
Let's go.

713
00:58:00,912 --> 00:58:01,652
I've been looking for you.

714
00:58:04,916 --> 00:58:06,395
Jesus Christ.

715
00:58:06,526 --> 00:58:07,571
Where'd you buy
this fucking outfit?

716
00:58:07,701 --> 00:58:08,441
The methadone clinic?

717
00:58:14,316 --> 00:58:17,058
Where is it?

718
00:58:17,189 --> 00:58:19,757
Where's the bag?

719
00:58:19,887 --> 00:58:21,498
THE SHERIFF [VOICEOVER]: Bag just like that one turned

720
00:58:21,628 --> 00:58:24,370
up missing from the bus depot.

721
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:26,154
Where's the bag
with the money in it?

722
00:58:26,285 --> 00:58:28,243
Where are you
going with that bag?

723
00:58:28,374 --> 00:58:29,636
Am I speaking Lithuanian?

724
00:58:29,767 --> 00:58:30,855
Where is it?

725
00:58:30,985 --> 00:58:32,639
Come here, you fuck.
Come here.

726
00:58:32,770 --> 00:58:33,684
Found the bag.

727
00:58:33,814 --> 00:58:36,556
Come here, you little fucker.

728
00:58:36,687 --> 00:58:37,905
THE COP [VOICEOVER]:
I'm a police officer.

729
00:58:38,036 --> 00:58:39,037
Give me the bag.

730
00:58:39,167 --> 00:58:39,994
Come here, you little fuck.

731
00:58:40,125 --> 00:58:40,865
You wanna die?

732
00:58:40,995 --> 00:58:42,301
Huh?

733
00:58:42,431 --> 00:58:43,824
- I don't care.
- You don't care?

734
00:58:43,955 --> 00:58:44,695
It's all right.

735
00:58:44,825 --> 00:58:46,871
It's OK.

736
00:58:47,001 --> 00:58:49,482
After I kill, you'll care.

737
00:58:49,613 --> 00:58:50,918
You know that, right?

738
00:58:54,008 --> 00:58:55,532
You'll be upset.

739
00:58:55,662 --> 00:58:56,750
THE SHERIFF [VOICEOVER]: Bag just like that one turned

740
00:58:56,881 --> 00:58:58,317
up missing from the bus depot.

741

You little fuck!

742
00:58:59,623 --> 00:59:00,841
I'll fuck you up!

743
00:59:00,972 --> 00:59:05,237
[music playing]

744
00:59:19,686 --> 00:59:20,774
Get out.

745
00:59:20,905 --> 00:59:21,601
No, no, no.

746
00:59:27,825 --> 00:59:30,784
You're gonna play a game.

747
00:59:30,915 --> 00:59:32,786
