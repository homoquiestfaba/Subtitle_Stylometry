00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:17,351
Oh, honey, you don't look so good.

2
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:19,853
You should stay home from brunch.

3
00:00:19,936 --> 00:00:21,646
- Are you sure?
- Mmm.

4
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:23,065
I really want to go.

5
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:25,108
You stay and rest.

6
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:27,778
You can see Grandma when we get back.

7
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,026
Thank you, Videobarn dumpster.

8
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,680
<i>Wanna fuck me, baby?</i>

9
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:39,223
Oh, yes. Yeah.

10
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:40,975
<i>You wanna fuck me?</i>

11
00:01:45,771 --> 00:01:48,983
Hey, Erik. Do you know if your dad
still has my clippers?

12
00:01:49,066 --> 00:01:51,903
I have no idea, Mr. Williams.

13
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:54,822
All right. Go back to what you were doing.

14
00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:00,661
<i>You wanna fuck me, baby?</i>

15
00:02:05,499 --> 00:02:06,584
<i>Yeah.</i>

16
00:02:17,553 --> 00:02:19,805
<i>Yeah. Fuck me, baby.</i>

17
00:02:20,222 --> 00:02:21,599
Yes, please.

18
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,478
<i>Oh, do me, baby.</i>

19
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:26,645
<i>Honey.</i>

20
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:28,606
<i>Yeah, just like that.</i>

21
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:31,984
<i>Oh, yeah! So good, so good, baby.</i>

22
00:02:32,151 --> 00:02:33,569
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

23
00:02:35,821 --> 00:02:37,364
I told you I was paying.

24
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:40,159
So what's the difference
if you forgot the coupon?

25
00:02:40,242 --> 00:02:41,827
Honey, she doesn't like to waste money.

26
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,038
There's no way I'm letting you pay full price

27
00:02:44,121 --> 00:02:47,791
when there's a two-for-one coupon
sitting on the counter.

28
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:49,001
I'll be right out.

29
00:02:49,084 --> 00:02:51,211
I'm coming, too. Now I gotta pee.

30
00:02:51,295 --> 00:02:52,379
I'll check on Erik.

31
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:53,547
Oh, yeah.

32
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,382
<i>Oh. Oh, that's good.</i>

33
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:57,759
<i>- You like that? I like that, too.
- Oh, yeah!</i>

34
00:02:58,969 --> 00:03:00,053
Here we go.

35
00:03:00,137 --> 00:03:01,180
Okay, Mom.

36
00:03:01,263 --> 00:03:03,098
<i>- Harder.
- Harder? Okay.</i>

37
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:04,308
<i>Oh, yeah! So good.</i>

38
00:03:04,391 --> 00:03:06,185
<i>- Like this?
- Yeah, right there, babe.</i>

39
00:03:06,268 --> 00:03:07,561
<i>- Like this? Like this?
- Yeah.</i>

40
00:03:07,644 --> 00:03:09,187
<i>Baby, do me just like that.</i>

41
00:03:10,564 --> 00:03:11,648
Okay, attagirl.

42
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,901
<i>- From behind?
- Oh, yeah, baby! Harder!</i>

43
00:03:14,985 --> 00:03:16,361
- Okay.
- All right.

44
00:03:16,987 --> 00:03:18,780
<i>- You wanna cum for me, baby?
- Oh, yeah.</i>

45
00:03:18,864 --> 00:03:20,866
<i>- Yeah? Cum for me, baby.
- I'm so close. I will.</i>

46
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:22,034
We're almost there.

47
00:03:22,117 --> 00:03:23,201
<i>You're gonna cum for me?</i>

48
00:03:23,285 --> 00:03:24,453
I'm about to. I'm about to.

49
00:03:24,536 --> 00:03:26,038
<i>That's it, baby.</i>

50
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,427
Grandma. Grandma.

51
00:03:42,304 --> 00:03:43,847
Grandma.

52
00:03:46,266 --> 00:03:48,435
<i>And that's the day
my grandmother died.</i>

53
00:03:48,518 --> 00:03:51,771
<i>And it's pretty much the story of my life.
But let me back things up a little bit.</i>

54
00:03:59,112 --> 00:04:02,157
<i>That's me. Not exactly the life of the party.</i>

55
00:04:05,326 --> 00:04:07,036
<i>That's my buddy, Mike Coozeman.</i>

56
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,748
<i>Everybody calls him Cooze
'cause that's all he's ever interested in.</i>

57
00:04:10,832 --> 00:04:14,294
<i>Cooze is a self-proclaimed ladies' man
and a legend in his own mind.</i>

58
00:04:14,377 --> 00:04:15,712
<i>Sometimes his methods are...</i>

59
00:04:17,255 --> 00:04:18,715
<i>questionable.</i>

60
00:04:20,425 --> 00:04:21,801
Very smooth.

61
00:04:22,468 --> 00:04:24,679
Oh, please. I consider that foreplay.

62
00:04:24,762 --> 00:04:25,847
Where's Ryan?

63
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:26,973
I don't know.

64
00:04:27,056 --> 00:04:31,686
Last time I saw him,
he was dancing with Stacey and Shelly.

65
00:04:33,271 --> 00:04:35,898
<i>That's my best friend, Ryan Grimm.</i>

66
00:04:36,774 --> 00:04:38,943
<i>I don't know how he does it.</i>

67
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:44,323
See, I told you there was enough
for both of you.

68
00:04:44,407 --> 00:04:45,658
<i>He moved here in second grade.</i>

69
00:04:45,742 --> 00:04:49,537
<i>Believe it or not, back then,
I was the one showing him the ropes.</i>

70
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,330
<i>Now he's the quarterback
of the football team,</i>

71
00:04:51,414 --> 00:04:53,666
<i>and the coolest guy in school.</i>

72
00:04:53,749 --> 00:04:56,919
Hey, I brought you a vodka and ginger ale
so it won't upset your stomach.

73
00:04:57,003 --> 00:04:59,297
Oh, thanks.

74
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:02,341
<i>That's my girlfriend, Tracy.</i>

75
00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:04,594
<i>We met in Biology, junior year.</i>

76
00:05:04,677 --> 00:05:07,638
Now make the first
incision into your frogs.

77
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:12,018
Cut along the ventral side from the pelvic
to the pectoral girdle.

78
00:05:13,728 --> 00:05:14,812
Oh!

79
00:05:16,272 --> 00:05:18,107
<i>I don't know what she saw in me,</i>

80
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:22,403
<i>but when I finally got up the nerve
to ask her out, she said yes.</i>

81
00:05:23,988 --> 00:05:27,074
<i>And for some reason,
she kept going out with me.</i>

82
00:05:28,367 --> 00:05:30,619
<i>It's like she totally gets me.</i>

83
00:05:32,496 --> 00:05:34,665
<i>And I try my best to get her.</i>

84
00:05:41,171 --> 00:05:43,757
Come on. Take the low one. It's easy.

85
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,012
Screw it.

86
00:05:53,934 --> 00:05:55,018
Oh!

87
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,190
Are you all right?

88
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:04,194
I don't know.
Is it possible to break your ass?

89
00:06:04,445 --> 00:06:07,906
Okay, I promise I'll never make you
ride a horse again.

90
00:06:08,907 --> 00:06:12,911
<i>Looks like she's perfect, right?
There's just one problem.</i>

91
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:19,835
<i>Tracy's not ready to have sex yet,
so that makes me a virgin.</i>

92
00:06:20,711 --> 00:06:23,964
<i>Now, being one of the only virgins in school
is bad enough,</i>

93
00:06:24,464 --> 00:06:26,591
<i>but it's even worse for me.</i>

94
00:06:28,635 --> 00:06:29,803
<i>Yup.</i>

95
00:06:30,095 --> 00:06:31,221
<i>I'm a Stifler.</i>

96
00:06:31,972 --> 00:06:34,474
<i>My cousins are the legendary Stifler boys.</i>

97
00:06:34,558 --> 00:06:39,271
<i>Steve, his brother, Matt,
and our other cousin, Dwight.</i>

98
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,774
<i>You see, with my last name
comes responsibility,</i>

99
00:06:42,858 --> 00:06:45,569
<i>a reputation that I'm supposed to live up to.</i>

100
00:06:45,735 --> 00:06:49,364
<i>Unfortunately, I've let down the family name
on more than one occasion.</i>

101
00:06:49,447 --> 00:06:50,740
What's your problem, Erik?

102
00:06:50,824 --> 00:06:53,785
Your cousin would've helped me
steal this beer.

103
00:06:53,868 --> 00:06:57,497
Dude, a real Stifler
would have totally fucked that goat.

104
00:06:57,581 --> 00:07:01,501
If you were really a Stifler,
you would have nailed Tracy by now.

105
00:07:02,127 --> 00:07:03,378
<i>Stifler.</i>

106
00:07:04,129 --> 00:07:07,924
<i>My name, my legacy, my curse.</i>

107
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:15,223
I can't believe you killed your grandmother
from jerking off.

108
00:07:15,306 --> 00:07:16,975
The coroner's findings were inconclusive.

109
00:07:17,058 --> 00:07:19,811
Why are you still whacking it
to that dumpster porn?

110
00:07:19,894 --> 00:07:22,897
Yeah, why don't you just go on the Internet
like a normal person?

111
00:07:22,981 --> 00:07:24,858
Well, because my mom
put on that CyberNanny

112
00:07:24,941 --> 00:07:27,902
after you spent the entire night looking up
German fetish porn.

113
00:07:27,986 --> 00:07:30,238
Man, you are pathetic.

114
00:07:30,572 --> 00:07:33,241
You know who I blame for this? Tracy.

115
00:07:33,324 --> 00:07:34,826
What? Why?

116
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:37,453
Because, if she would just give up
a little ass,

117
00:07:37,537 --> 00:07:41,833
then maybe you wouldn't be killing
your relatives with your money shot.

118
00:07:43,835 --> 00:07:48,798
Erik, you cannot graduate a virgin.
For Christ's sake, you're a Stifler.

119
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,599
Hey, sweetie. How was your math class?

120
00:07:58,683 --> 00:08:01,102
It was all right. How was English?

121
00:08:01,185 --> 00:08:03,229
Pretty interesting, actually.

122
00:08:03,312 --> 00:08:04,897
You know that kid
that I always tell you about?

123
00:08:04,981 --> 00:08:08,150
- He was doing that pencil thing all...
- That's cool.

124
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:10,820
You okay?

125
00:08:10,903 --> 00:08:12,363
Yeah, I'm fine.

126
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:18,202
Erik, we've been dating for two years.
I know when something's bothering you.

127
00:08:18,285 --> 00:08:19,578
Nothing's wrong.

128
00:08:19,662 --> 00:08:22,415
I don't know why you think
you have this psychic ability to read me.

129
00:08:22,498 --> 00:08:24,875
Because I do. What is it?

130
00:08:25,835 --> 00:08:29,004
You're gonna think I'm an asshole.
Let's just forget about it.

131
00:08:29,088 --> 00:08:32,758
Come on, Erik, you know you can talk to me
about anything.

132
00:08:34,301 --> 00:08:35,719
All right.

133
00:08:40,891 --> 00:08:42,476
It's the sex.

134
00:08:43,727 --> 00:08:44,812
I mean,

135
00:08:44,895 --> 00:08:48,107
we've been together for two years.
Two years, Trace.

136
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,567
I mean, when we were juniors,
it was one thing,

137
00:08:50,651 --> 00:08:52,319
but we're seniors now,
and this whole virgin thing

138
00:08:52,403 --> 00:08:54,905
is starting to have
some serious consequences.

139
00:08:54,989 --> 00:08:56,991
I mean, people are dying.

140
00:08:58,242 --> 00:08:59,952
I told you, I'm not ready yet.

141
00:09:00,035 --> 00:09:02,079
I am so ready.

142
00:09:02,413 --> 00:09:04,706
Can't I be ready enough for the both of us?

143
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,708
It doesn't work that way.

144
00:09:06,792 --> 00:09:08,377
It should.

145
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:11,421
I'm sorry, Erik.
I know how patient you've been.

146
00:09:11,505 --> 00:09:13,841
I know. It's just sometimes...

147
00:09:14,341 --> 00:09:15,384
What?

148
00:09:15,676 --> 00:09:19,555
Well, you're a girl.
It's a lot easier for you to be a virgin

149
00:09:19,638 --> 00:09:22,558
because the longer you stay a virgin,
the more pure and innocent you seem.

150
00:09:22,641 --> 00:09:24,017
The longer I stay a virgin,

151
00:09:24,101 --> 00:09:27,688
the more I become the laughingstock
of the entire school.

152
00:09:29,189 --> 00:09:31,066
I'm sorry, but... I mean...

153
00:09:31,149 --> 00:09:32,985
I'm sorry I brought it up.

154
00:09:34,861 --> 00:09:37,239
I gotta go. I'll see you after school.

155
00:09:39,408 --> 00:09:40,492
Okay.

156
00:09:42,828 --> 00:09:43,870
Bye.

157
00:09:49,876 --> 00:09:52,963
I'm telling you, his dick was this big.

158
00:09:54,673 --> 00:09:57,092
What about Erik?
I bet he's got a big one.

159
00:09:57,175 --> 00:09:59,135
Well, Tracy wouldn't know.

160
00:09:59,219 --> 00:10:00,262
Whatever.

161
00:10:01,304 --> 00:10:04,057
Yeah, I guess it's pretty hard
to figure out dick size from dry humping.

162
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,475
Brooke, that's mean.

163
00:10:05,558 --> 00:10:08,603
Just because I don't have a catalog
of the school's dick sizes like you,

164
00:10:08,687 --> 00:10:10,730
doesn't mean I don't know a thing or two.

165
00:10:10,814 --> 00:10:13,733
Okay, so how big is Erik's?

166
00:10:16,444 --> 00:10:17,529
See? Told you.

167
00:10:17,612 --> 00:10:18,988
Come on, Brooke.

168
00:10:19,072 --> 00:10:20,573
It's not like that with us.

169
00:10:20,657 --> 00:10:22,951
I mean, Erik's different.
He respects my boundaries.

170
00:10:23,034 --> 00:10:25,078
Well, you better give that boy
a reason to stick around,

171
00:10:25,161 --> 00:10:27,789
or he's gonna find a girl
with looser boundaries.

172
00:10:28,206 --> 00:10:29,374
Erik would never do that.

173
00:10:29,457 --> 00:10:31,084
Yeah, that's what you said about Trent.

174
00:10:31,167 --> 00:10:34,671
He broke up with you over sex,
and that was sophomore year.

175
00:10:34,754 --> 00:10:37,757
Yeah, this just isn't gonna
work without the sex.

176
00:10:38,424 --> 00:10:42,345
God, Trent is cute,
and I heard he just broke up with Holly.

177
00:10:43,262 --> 00:10:47,392
Look, Tracy, we love you, and we love Erik,
but let's get real.

178
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:50,353
He's a guy, and guys have certain needs.

179
00:10:50,436 --> 00:10:54,273
They really do.
It's like a caveman thing or something.

180
00:10:54,357 --> 00:10:57,902
Yeah, I can't believe
you've kept him tied up this long.

181
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,988
Hey, Erik, guess who I just talked to?

182
00:11:01,072 --> 00:11:02,156
Who?

183
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,283
Your cousin Stifler up at Michigan.

184
00:11:04,367 --> 00:11:05,785
Why are you talking to my cousin Dwight?

185
00:11:05,868 --> 00:11:07,954
Oh, we talk all the time.

186
00:11:08,037 --> 00:11:09,413
What? We have a lot in common.

187
00:11:09,497 --> 00:11:11,332
What's that crazy bastard up to?

188
00:11:11,415 --> 00:11:15,169
He's in some fraternity,
and all those guys do is drink and fuck.

189
00:11:15,253 --> 00:11:18,005
And it just so happens that they're throwing
a monster party this weekend

190
00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:19,173
for the Naked Mile.

191
00:11:19,256 --> 00:11:20,383
What's the Naked Mile?

192
00:11:20,466 --> 00:11:22,259
Oh, dude, it's this thing
where thousands of students

193
00:11:22,343 --> 00:11:23,719
run naked through campus.

194
00:11:23,803 --> 00:11:26,013
It's the way of blowing off
steam after exams.

195
00:11:26,097 --> 00:11:27,890
Thousands of naked chicks?

196
00:11:27,973 --> 00:11:30,976
Stifler says that this party is gonna be epic.

197
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,229
Bottom line is, this place is played out.

198
00:11:33,312 --> 00:11:34,647
High school's over for us.

199
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,690
It's time to plant our flag in a new land.

200
00:11:37,108 --> 00:11:40,653
Porn, cumshot, dead grandmother,
grounded forever?

201
00:11:40,736 --> 00:11:41,821
Don't worry.

202
00:11:41,904 --> 00:11:45,199
Just tell your parents that, you know,
you're thinking about going to school there.

203
00:11:45,282 --> 00:11:47,201
- I don't know, man.
- Oh, please.

204
00:11:47,284 --> 00:11:49,912
Your mom cried when you told her
you were going to school in Boston.

205
00:11:49,995 --> 00:11:52,706
She'll probably help you pack
if she thinks it'll keep you close to home.

206
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,041
I'll help you pack.

207
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:55,793
I'll make sandwiches.

208
00:11:55,918 --> 00:11:57,002
Chicken salad?

209
00:11:57,086 --> 00:11:58,170
Of course.

210
00:11:58,253 --> 00:12:00,255
Are you gonna get a chance
to see your cousin?

211
00:12:00,339 --> 00:12:03,217
Yeah. We might stop by and say hello.

212
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,178
Now, there's someone you
should definitely look up to.

213
00:12:06,261 --> 00:12:08,639
I bet he doesn't have time
to blow his load on his family.

214
00:12:08,722 --> 00:12:10,474
- Harry, please.
I don't understand.

215
00:12:10,557 --> 00:12:13,769
When I was your age,
I was up to my neck in poontang.

216
00:12:14,103 --> 00:12:16,313
I didn't have time to spank my monkey.

217
00:12:16,396 --> 00:12:19,775
Thank you for that very
disturbing image, Dad.

218
00:12:19,858 --> 00:12:23,737
I mean, Stiflers do not fake
being sick to stay home and pull dick.

219
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:24,947
We cut class to get ass.

220
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:27,407
Yes, I know.
That saying is on our family crest.

221
00:12:27,491 --> 00:12:29,368
Oh, don't let me forget
to pack the Imodium AD.

222
00:12:29,451 --> 00:12:30,786
You know, just in case you get diarrhea.

223
00:12:30,869 --> 00:12:32,788
- Mom.
- I am so excited.

224
00:12:32,871 --> 00:12:33,914
Aren't you excited, Harry?

225
00:12:33,997 --> 00:12:35,707
I'm very excited.

226
00:12:36,667 --> 00:12:38,335
Don't you get excited.

227
00:12:38,418 --> 00:12:39,795
<i>It worked
just like you said.</i>

228
00:12:39,878 --> 00:12:42,839
She's helping me pack,
and she's even making us sandwiches.

229
00:12:42,923 --> 00:12:44,383
<i>- Chicken salad?
- Yup.</i>

230
00:12:44,466 --> 00:12:45,592
Sweet.

231
00:12:45,675 --> 00:12:47,427
See, I told you. Never doubt me.

232
00:12:47,719 --> 00:12:51,223
<i>Man, this weekend is gonna be tits.
I can't wait to see Stifler.</i>

233
00:12:51,932 --> 00:12:54,684
Hey, how come you never call me Stifler?

234
00:12:55,101 --> 00:12:56,686
You're more of an Erik.

235
00:12:58,021 --> 00:12:59,272
Hold on.

236
00:12:59,981 --> 00:13:01,441
That's Tracy. I'd better take it.

237
00:13:01,525 --> 00:13:02,609
All right, later.

238
00:13:05,612 --> 00:13:08,031
Hey, sweetie.
Listen, about today, I'm really...

239
00:13:08,114 --> 00:13:10,241
Erik, I wanna have sex.

240
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:12,243
Excuse me?

241
00:13:12,744 --> 00:13:14,996
<i>I wanna have sex.</i>

242
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,206
Are you serious?

243
00:13:16,289 --> 00:13:17,624
Absolutely.

244
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:21,336
Do you have me on a conference call?
Because if you do, that is so not cool.

245
00:13:21,419 --> 00:13:23,088
Erik, this isn't a joke.

246
00:13:23,713 --> 00:13:25,965
I want to have sex.

247
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:30,094
Yes! Yes, yes.

248
00:13:30,637 --> 00:13:31,721
<i>Tonight.</i>

249
00:13:31,805 --> 00:13:32,889
What?

250
00:13:32,972 --> 00:13:35,391
Tonight. I wanna have sex tonight.

251
00:13:35,975 --> 00:13:37,477
How am I supposed to get out of my house?

252
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,978
<i>That's up to you.</i>

253
00:13:39,103 --> 00:13:42,857
But at midnight, I'll be in my basement

254
00:13:42,941 --> 00:13:44,567
waiting to be ravished.

255
00:13:45,026 --> 00:13:46,277
I'll be there.

256
00:14:08,508 --> 00:14:09,842
Hypocrite.

257
00:14:11,886 --> 00:14:14,680
So you get the beer and the weed,
and I'll handle the nitrous.

258
00:14:14,764 --> 00:14:16,641
You got it. What's Erik bringing?

259
00:14:16,724 --> 00:14:17,892
Sandwiches.

260
00:14:17,975 --> 00:14:21,604
Nice. Chicken salad and college pussy.

261
00:14:21,687 --> 00:14:23,314
My favorite combination.

262
00:14:23,397 --> 00:14:25,191
Yeah, well, at least you'll get to taste
the chicken salad.

263
00:14:25,274 --> 00:14:26,442
<i>Ow.</i>

264
00:14:26,525 --> 00:14:28,361
Hey, what do you think Erik's doing
right now?

265
00:14:28,444 --> 00:14:30,655
Probably beating off to dumpster porn.

266
00:14:31,364 --> 00:14:34,909
No more beating off to dumpster porn.
No more virgin jokes.

267
00:14:34,992 --> 00:14:37,328
Tonight, Erik Stifler becomes a man.

268
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:16,241
- Hi.
- Come on in.

269
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:25,709
- All right, listen.
- No.

270
00:15:26,543 --> 00:15:27,961
No talking.

271
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:55,405
Wait.

272
00:15:55,489 --> 00:15:56,573
What?

273
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:58,074
Did you hear something?

274
00:15:58,158 --> 00:16:01,828
No. Don't worry, my parents are passed out.

275
00:16:04,206 --> 00:16:07,083
Are you sure?
You know how my stomach gets.

276
00:16:07,876 --> 00:16:10,462
Here, I'll help you relax.

277
00:16:25,101 --> 00:16:27,312
You brought something, right?

278
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:31,649
Oh, shit. I left it at home.

279
00:16:33,318 --> 00:16:35,361
I can run back and get it.
I'll be back in like five...

280
00:16:35,445 --> 00:16:37,989
No, no, don't worry. I've got one.

281
00:16:41,784 --> 00:16:44,204
Do you wanna put it on or should I?

282
00:16:44,454 --> 00:16:46,247
Let's put it on together.

283
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:05,475
Are you ready?

284
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:07,351
Yeah.

285
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:12,565
Shit. Someone's coming.
Quick, get behind the bar. Now!

286
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,621
Honey, what are you still doing up?

287
00:17:27,705 --> 00:17:28,831
Yoga.

288
00:17:29,332 --> 00:17:30,583
I ate too much at dinner.

289
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:32,126
Why don't you take an Alka-Seltzer?

290
00:17:32,209 --> 00:17:33,961
Alka-Seltzer is for babies.

291
00:17:34,045 --> 00:17:35,504
I just need a nightcap.

292
00:17:38,841 --> 00:17:40,176
Excuse me.

293
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:42,470
Sounds like you could use an Alka-Seltzer.

294
00:17:42,553 --> 00:17:44,680
Daddy. Here, let me get you your drink.

295
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:46,891
No, that's okay, honey.
You go back to your yoga.

296
00:17:46,974 --> 00:17:48,601
No, Daddy, I really want to.

297
00:17:48,684 --> 00:17:51,770
Sweetie, I'm a grown man.
I can make my own drink.

298
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:08,370
What was that?

299
00:18:09,246 --> 00:18:10,331
What was what?

300
00:18:10,414 --> 00:18:11,623
I didn't hear anything.

301
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:15,419
There was a noise
coming from the laundry room.

302
00:18:45,115 --> 00:18:46,408
I must be hearing things.

303
00:18:46,491 --> 00:18:49,786
See, Daddy? I told you.
Now, come make your drink.

304
00:18:53,081 --> 00:18:54,166
What the...

305
00:19:10,432 --> 00:19:12,100
You all right, baby?

306
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:13,685
I'm fine, Daddy.

307
00:19:27,324 --> 00:19:30,618
Oh, that sick bastard took
a shit in our dryer.

308
00:19:32,245 --> 00:19:33,955
I'm calling the police.

309
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:51,723
Ryan? Ryan?

310
00:19:51,806 --> 00:19:53,850
Ryan, get up man. Ryan!

311
00:19:53,933 --> 00:19:55,476
What the fuck?

312
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,186
It's me. It's Erik.

313
00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:00,148
Dude, why are you naked in my room?

314
00:20:01,774 --> 00:20:03,943
And with a rubber on your dick.

315
00:20:04,027 --> 00:20:06,112
Oh, yeah. Sorry about that.

316
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:09,991
Look, I'm in serious trouble, okay?
I need your help.

317
00:20:11,951 --> 00:20:13,661
What's that smell?

318
00:20:14,078 --> 00:20:16,080
Did you step in dog shit?

319
00:20:16,747 --> 00:20:18,040
Yeah.

320
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:22,086
Hey, man, thanks for the clothes.
I'll get them back to you.

321
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:25,006
No, thanks. Why don't you just burn them?

322
00:20:26,841 --> 00:20:29,302
Wonder if I get a reward for turning you in.

323
00:20:29,552 --> 00:20:31,679
<i>If the alleged
improprieties are confirmed,</i>

324
00:20:31,762 --> 00:20:34,056
<i>it could be devastating for the White House.</i>

325
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,891
<i>Sources near the
administration would neither</i>

326
00:20:35,975 --> 00:20:38,227
<i>confirm nor deny the allegations.</i>

327
00:20:38,311 --> 00:20:41,981
<i>And in local news, a masked burglar broke
into an area residence,</i>

328
00:20:42,064 --> 00:20:46,360
<i>defecated in the family dryer,
and then exposed himself to a teenage girl.</i>

329
00:20:46,444 --> 00:20:47,945
<i>Police are continuing the search,</i>

330
00:20:48,028 --> 00:20:50,906
<i>but the whereabouts and
identity of the perpetrator are unknown.</i>

331
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:52,616
What is wrong with these people?

332
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,285
<i>And now, Dakota Snow
with the weekend forecast.</i>

333
00:20:54,368 --> 00:20:55,453
I don't know.

334
00:21:04,003 --> 00:21:05,129
You scared me.

335
00:21:05,212 --> 00:21:06,463
Sorry.

336
00:21:06,922 --> 00:21:08,048
Listen, about last night...

337
00:21:08,132 --> 00:21:11,719
Yeah, you know,
I'd just really rather not talk about it.

338
00:21:11,927 --> 00:21:14,013
I really think that we should.

339
00:21:14,847 --> 00:21:17,850
Erik, you took a crap in my dryer.

340
00:21:17,975 --> 00:21:20,477
Your dad scared the shit out of me.

341
00:21:21,103 --> 00:21:22,396
- Wait.
- You know, let's just...

342
00:21:22,479 --> 00:21:24,565
Let's forget about it, okay?

343
00:21:26,775 --> 00:21:29,361
Okay, but what about the other thing?

344
00:21:32,322 --> 00:21:33,615
The sex?

345
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:36,952
I'm taking last night as a sign from above.

346
00:21:37,077 --> 00:21:38,912
But maybe...
I mean, if your dad didn't come down...

347
00:21:38,996 --> 00:21:41,999
Erik, I love you. I'm just...

348
00:21:42,499 --> 00:21:44,084
I'm not ready yet.

349
00:21:44,668 --> 00:21:45,877
Really?

350
00:21:47,421 --> 00:21:48,630
Really.

351
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:52,175
But I also realized just how ready you are.

352
00:21:53,093 --> 00:21:55,220
I don't wanna break up over sex.

353
00:21:55,304 --> 00:21:57,139
I don't think we have to.

354
00:21:58,098 --> 00:22:02,519
I'm not ready. You are.
It's selfish for me to keep you tied down.

355
00:22:04,354 --> 00:22:06,857
So, this is what I'm proposing.

356
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:10,444
A guilt-free pass for this weekend.

357
00:22:10,527 --> 00:22:13,697
That means you can do
whatever you want up there

358
00:22:13,989 --> 00:22:16,116
with no consequences.

359
00:22:17,909 --> 00:22:19,661
You're sure about this?

360
00:22:19,911 --> 00:22:23,498
I don't think love and sex
have to be tied to each other,

361
00:22:24,457 --> 00:22:26,418
so I'm okay with this.

362
00:22:26,835 --> 00:22:30,046
One weekend. Get it out of your system,

363
00:22:31,423 --> 00:22:33,216
and come back to me.

364
00:22:34,718 --> 00:22:36,594
Is this some kind of a test?

365
00:22:37,846 --> 00:22:39,180
Not at all.

366
00:22:46,604 --> 00:22:48,356
and one of bomb beer.
Yes.

367
00:22:48,439 --> 00:22:49,691
See, this is perfect.

368
00:22:50,567 --> 00:22:52,193
Hey, we all set?

369
00:22:52,443 --> 00:22:53,903
I don't know.

370
00:22:53,987 --> 00:22:55,071
I told you he'd puss out.

371
00:22:55,154 --> 00:22:58,074
Tell me you at least
brought the sandwiches.

372
00:22:58,241 --> 00:22:59,993
What's the problem?

373
00:23:00,076 --> 00:23:01,786
There is no problem.

374
00:23:02,078 --> 00:23:04,455
Tracy just gave me
a guilt-free pass for the weekend,

375
00:23:04,539 --> 00:23:06,958
which means I can do anything I want.

376
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:08,334
Anything?

377
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:10,795
You mean...

378
00:23:10,878 --> 00:23:14,716
Yeah, she said
that love and sex don't have to be linked.

379
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,467
She wants me to get it out of my system.

380
00:23:16,551 --> 00:23:21,389
Dude, your girlfriend just went from
the lamest to the coolest in one shot.

381
00:23:22,223 --> 00:23:24,350
You guys think it could be, like,
some sort of a test?

382
00:23:24,433 --> 00:23:26,686
- No, no.
- No, no.

383
00:23:26,769 --> 00:23:28,229
Tracy's a smart girl.

384
00:23:28,312 --> 00:23:30,022
She's mature enough to see
that you're a man...

385
00:23:30,106 --> 00:23:32,525
- Yeah.
...and you have certain needs.

386
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,693
You think so?

387
00:23:33,776 --> 00:23:35,194
Absolutely.

388
00:23:36,153 --> 00:23:37,196
You're driving.

389
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,782
Now get in the car
so we can go get you some random pussy.

390
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:44,578
Gentlemen, it's Friday afternoon,
we've got a full tank of gas,

391
00:23:44,662 --> 00:23:46,998
a quarter ounce of weed,
three cases of beer,

392
00:23:47,081 --> 00:23:49,417
a ten-pound tank of nitrous,
we're underage...

393
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,044
And I am too drunk to drive.

394
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:54,213
Hit it.

395
00:24:15,818 --> 00:24:17,945
You sure this shit's safe?

396
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:21,907
It's as safe as any other chemical
used to freeze-dry animals.

397
00:24:25,077 --> 00:24:26,829
Look at the size of that fucking chicken.

398
00:24:26,912 --> 00:24:27,955
Where?

399
00:24:30,916 --> 00:24:33,419
Whoa, what the fuck?
- What fucking chicken?

400
00:24:33,544 --> 00:24:35,796
Relax, he's hallucinating.

401
00:24:37,005 --> 00:24:39,007
Are you out of your fucking mind?

402
00:24:39,091 --> 00:24:41,927
Yeah, Tracy. What were you thinking?

403
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:44,721
But you guys told me
I had to give him a reason to stick around.

404
00:24:44,805 --> 00:24:46,682
Yeah, you give him a reason,

405
00:24:46,765 --> 00:24:49,226
not give him a free pass
to go have a weekend orgy.

406
00:24:49,309 --> 00:24:50,644
You've got to stop this.

407
00:24:50,727 --> 00:24:54,147
If he has sex this weekend,
what do you think's gonna happen?

408
00:24:54,231 --> 00:24:55,482
That it will get it out of his system.

409
00:24:55,565 --> 00:24:57,317
Oh, yeah. That's how it works.

410
00:24:57,401 --> 00:24:59,736
He's gonna go from
getting laid back to dry humping.

411
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,488
It's pretty risky, Tracy.

412
00:25:01,571 --> 00:25:04,991
Risky? It's a fucking Pandora's box, literally.

413
00:25:05,784 --> 00:25:10,122
And once he's felt
the soft pink velvet on the inside of the box,

414
00:25:10,205 --> 00:25:13,959
he's not gonna go back
to rubbing his dick on the outside of the lid.

415
00:25:14,042 --> 00:25:15,836
Never thought of it like that.

416
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,130
Tracy, men are like dogs

417
00:25:18,213 --> 00:25:20,924
that run around and hump
anything they see.

418
00:25:21,007 --> 00:25:24,010
Now go and get your dog back on its leash.

419
00:25:47,158 --> 00:25:48,660
Come on, Erik.

420
00:25:54,916 --> 00:25:57,377
I knew it was too good to be true.

421
00:26:02,882 --> 00:26:05,718
Sorry, kids. It's for the best.

422
00:26:32,662 --> 00:26:33,746
Tracy?

423
00:26:34,747 --> 00:26:35,957
Oh, Mr. Levenstein.

424
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,208
- Hi.
- Hi.

425
00:26:37,291 --> 00:26:39,126
You're back for more yoga.

426
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:40,711
Well, my wife is hooked on it,

427
00:26:40,795 --> 00:26:45,758
and she thinks if I can be
a little more flexible, we can try some new...

428
00:26:47,343 --> 00:26:51,180
<i>Have you ever heard of a book
called the Kama Sutra?</i>

429
00:26:53,015 --> 00:26:54,058
No.

430
00:26:54,517 --> 00:26:56,394
Oh, well, my wife just got it,

431
00:26:56,477 --> 00:27:00,231
and there's some stuff in there that requires
some serious stretching,

432
00:27:00,314 --> 00:27:02,358
if you know what I mean.

433
00:27:02,942 --> 00:27:06,153
Are you okay, honey?
You look a little upset.

434
00:27:06,737 --> 00:27:09,698
Oh, you know, just some boyfriend stuff.

435
00:27:09,782 --> 00:27:11,992
Oh, boyfriend stuff.

436
00:27:12,576 --> 00:27:15,079
Well, if there's anything I can do.

437
00:27:15,996 --> 00:27:19,667
No offense or anything,
but I don't think you'd understand.

438
00:27:20,292 --> 00:27:21,669
Oh, I see.

439
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:25,047
You know, my son had his fair share

440
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:28,884
of relationship/sexual/

441
00:27:30,552 --> 00:27:32,805
pastry-related difficulties,

442
00:27:32,888 --> 00:27:37,309
and I think my advice
helped him over the years.

443
00:27:38,811 --> 00:27:42,481
Well, do you have any advice for a girl
dumb enough to give her virgin boyfriend

444
00:27:42,564 --> 00:27:45,067
a guilt-free pass for the weekend?

445
00:27:45,692 --> 00:27:48,612
I'm sorry, a guilt-free pass?

446
00:27:48,946 --> 00:27:52,282
That means he could do whatever he wants
this weekend with no consequences.

447
00:27:52,366 --> 00:27:54,284
Oh my!

448
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:57,579
Well, that certainly sounds progressive,

449
00:27:58,247 --> 00:28:03,210
and a safe bet on what is probably gonna be
a humdrum weekend.

450
00:28:05,003 --> 00:28:07,589
He's at the Naked Mile this weekend.

451
00:28:07,756 --> 00:28:12,010
You gave your boyfriend a guilt-free pass
to the Naked Mile? Are you kidding me?

452
00:28:12,094 --> 00:28:15,389
Tracy, the Naked Mile is insane. You...

453
00:28:15,472 --> 00:28:19,142
From what I hear.
I wouldn't know from personal experience

454
00:28:19,226 --> 00:28:23,647
because I, you know,
I have nothing whatsoever to do with it.

455
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:26,358
But, look, Tracy,

456
00:28:26,441 --> 00:28:29,694
even if your boyfriend is at this Naked Mile,

457
00:28:29,778 --> 00:28:32,781
it doesn't mean he's gonna do anything.

458
00:28:34,032 --> 00:28:35,116
Really?

459
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,286
Well, just because he can,
doesn't mean he will.

460
00:28:39,537 --> 00:28:42,582
Relationships are all about trust.

461
00:28:45,794 --> 00:28:48,213
Yeah, I guess you're right.

462
00:28:49,005 --> 00:28:51,883
<i>Well, namaste.</i>

463
00:28:52,384 --> 00:28:53,635
<i>Namaste.</i>

464
00:29:11,611 --> 00:29:13,655
Hey, have you seen my phone?

465
00:29:13,738 --> 00:29:14,906
No.

466
00:29:14,989 --> 00:29:16,950
Maybe you left it back at school.

467
00:29:17,033 --> 00:29:18,993
No, no, I thought I put in my backpack.

468
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:26,042
Hey, you wanna pull over
at that stop up ahead? I gotta take a piss.

469
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:28,544
Just piss in a can or something.

470
00:29:30,046 --> 00:29:32,048
Man, I could cut my dick on the lip.

471
00:29:32,131 --> 00:29:33,591
Well, piss out the window.

472
00:30:00,368 --> 00:30:03,579
Love that breeze off the lake.

473
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,511
This place is incredible.

474
00:30:18,761 --> 00:30:21,847
Just think, next year
I'm gonna be going here.

475
00:30:21,931 --> 00:30:24,808
Yeah, thanks to Daddy
and his alumni connections.

476
00:30:24,892 --> 00:30:27,728
Fuck off.
I told you, I got in on my SAT scores.

477
00:30:27,811 --> 00:30:30,272
You scored five points
above being legally retarded.

478
00:30:32,191 --> 00:30:34,693
Whatever. Still got in.

479
00:30:35,861 --> 00:30:37,946
Hey, why does it smell like piss back here?

480
00:30:41,033 --> 00:30:43,202
This is it. Beta Delta Xi.

481
00:30:43,285 --> 00:30:45,120
This is the house?
Yeah.

482
00:30:45,204 --> 00:30:46,246
Cool.

483
00:30:48,165 --> 00:30:49,208
Whoa.

484
00:30:55,714 --> 00:30:56,965
What's going on here?

485
00:30:57,049 --> 00:30:58,675
I have no idea.

486
00:31:06,767 --> 00:31:10,312
Drink. Drink. Drink. Drink.

487
00:31:15,442 --> 00:31:17,402
Drink. Drink. Drink. Drink.

488
00:31:17,486 --> 00:31:18,570
Hold your drink!

489
00:31:22,449 --> 00:31:23,742
Whoa.

490
00:31:30,081 --> 00:31:31,791
Okay.

491
00:31:32,417 --> 00:31:33,835
Yeah.

492
00:31:37,505 --> 00:31:39,966
How you feeling there, Stretch?

493
00:31:40,425 --> 00:31:41,676
Little dizzy?

494
00:31:43,178 --> 00:31:44,596
'Cause guess what?

495
00:31:44,888 --> 00:31:48,933
Stifler can drink this shit all day long.

496
00:31:54,314 --> 00:31:55,690
Stifler!

497
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:59,444
Your cousin is my hero.

498
00:32:02,197 --> 00:32:04,783
- All right, everybody freeze!
- Oh, shit.

499
00:32:04,866 --> 00:32:06,451
Campus security.

500
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:09,329
Nobody takes another drink...

501
00:32:13,541 --> 00:32:16,794
...till I got my bet down. I got $200 on Stifler!

502
00:32:21,424 --> 00:32:24,385
Spanky, you had me going,
you silly son of a bitch.

503
00:32:24,469 --> 00:32:26,179
Let's do it. Do it!

504
00:32:26,262 --> 00:32:27,305
Yeah.

505
00:32:44,071 --> 00:32:47,325
You got steel nuts, my man.
I'll give you that much.

506
00:32:47,408 --> 00:32:49,076
But you're no match for the Stif-man.

507
00:32:51,078 --> 00:32:52,830
Fuck you, Stifler.

508
00:32:54,707 --> 00:32:55,833
Yeah.

509
00:32:57,585 --> 00:32:58,711
Yeah.

510
00:33:03,883 --> 00:33:05,217
What's the matter, Boy Band?

511
00:33:05,301 --> 00:33:08,095
You need a little something
to settle your stomach?

512
00:33:18,105 --> 00:33:20,524
Yeah, take in the Stifler essence.

513
00:33:21,192 --> 00:33:23,319
Mighty pungent.

514
00:33:33,412 --> 00:33:34,496
Yeah!

515
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:38,292
And still Heavyweight Drinking Champion
of the World,

516
00:33:38,375 --> 00:33:43,380
Dwight "The Iron Liver" Stifler!

517
00:33:45,632 --> 00:33:48,844
I'm a bad motherfucker, baby!

518
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,437
He's okay. He's okay.

519
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:07,321
Hey, cousin.

520
00:34:08,822 --> 00:34:10,198
How you doing?

521
00:34:10,657 --> 00:34:13,702
I'm fine, Dwight. Are you okay?

522
00:34:14,286 --> 00:34:15,621
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

523
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:18,040
I'm fine.

524
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:22,335
Hey, I heard that you killed
Grandma with your cumshot.

525
00:34:24,296 --> 00:34:25,630
That sucks, man.

526
00:34:30,886 --> 00:34:32,304
Should we take him to the hospital?

527
00:34:32,387 --> 00:34:34,055
No, he'll be fine.

528
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:37,017
He told me he does this, like, once a month.

529
00:34:38,059 --> 00:34:42,355
Okay, well, you guys keep an eye on him.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

530
00:34:59,164 --> 00:35:01,541
So, when are we gonna start partying?

531
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:04,085
Oh, someone's feeling a little frisky.

532
00:35:04,419 --> 00:35:07,922
Let's just say I finally decided
to live up to the family name.

533
00:35:09,883 --> 00:35:13,094
Stifler? We got a serious problem, man.

534
00:35:13,887 --> 00:35:17,098
Mike and the guys just got arrested
trying to steal a monkey from the zoo.

535
00:35:18,766 --> 00:35:21,686
So what's the problem?
Just take the money out of my bail fund.

536
00:35:21,769 --> 00:35:23,980
They're almost half our football team.

537
00:35:24,063 --> 00:35:26,899
We gotta put a team
on the field, man, or we're done.

538
00:35:26,983 --> 00:35:29,319
- Why?
- 'Cause we're already on probation.

539
00:35:29,652 --> 00:35:32,322
We gotta participate in every intermural event

540
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:34,741
or we're kicked off campus, man.

541
00:35:34,907 --> 00:35:36,492
We're four guys short.

542
00:35:41,247 --> 00:35:42,331
I play football.

543
00:35:43,416 --> 00:35:45,418
I played freshman year.

544
00:35:47,128 --> 00:35:48,421
What about you?

545
00:35:49,297 --> 00:35:50,715
A little Nerf here and there.

546
00:35:50,798 --> 00:35:53,092
Good enough. Stifler?

547
00:35:53,176 --> 00:35:54,302
Mmm?

548
00:35:54,385 --> 00:35:57,221
Can you play?

549
00:36:03,185 --> 00:36:07,064
Don't ever

550
00:36:07,148 --> 00:36:09,150
ask if Stifler can play.

551
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:20,995
I'm good.

552
00:36:24,165 --> 00:36:28,419
The team we're playing's
been undefeated five straight years.

553
00:36:28,502 --> 00:36:30,713
These guys must be pretty serious.

554
00:36:30,796 --> 00:36:33,048
Fucking-A-right, they're serious.

555
00:36:33,257 --> 00:36:35,384
Lambda Pi Gamma.

556
00:36:35,467 --> 00:36:38,929
They're our arch rivals in everything:
Sports, women, booze.

557
00:36:39,972 --> 00:36:42,766
These guys are fucking evil.

558
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:45,519
Get ready!

559
00:36:45,602 --> 00:36:46,937
Come on!

560
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:48,856
Down!

561
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:51,900
Blue 42.

562
00:36:52,151 --> 00:36:53,235
They're midgets.

563
00:36:53,318 --> 00:36:54,403
Hut, hut!

564
00:36:58,282 --> 00:37:00,284
Don't let their size fool you.

565
00:37:00,367 --> 00:37:04,121
These guys are fucking animals.

566
00:37:04,246 --> 00:37:07,291
Did I do too much nitrous?
A midget fraternity?

567
00:37:07,541 --> 00:37:12,045
Those rich midgets from those infomercials
gave the school some huge grant,

568
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:15,841
and started a school
for the vertically challenged and a fraternity.

569
00:37:15,924 --> 00:37:18,677
And this is where every midget
in America wants to be.

570
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,803
Hot feet!

571
00:37:19,886 --> 00:37:20,971
That's right.

572
00:37:21,054 --> 00:37:22,097
Breakdown.

573
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:24,725
These guys are the best of the best.

574
00:37:25,976 --> 00:37:27,519
Well, well, well.

575
00:37:28,186 --> 00:37:32,149
If it isn't the regular-size retards
and Captain Retard himself.

576
00:37:32,232 --> 00:37:34,151
You ready to get your ass
kicked again, Shitler?

577
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:37,988
Get back to Oz there
before you get your ass stomped, Toto.

578
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:42,701
Toto was the dog, you fucking idiot.

579
00:37:42,826 --> 00:37:46,204
Lick my balls, big-wheel-riding,
midget motherfucker.

580
00:37:46,288 --> 00:37:48,164
It's little person, fuck-nut.

581
00:37:48,498 --> 00:37:52,127
This year, I'm gonna take
a chunk out of your other leg.

582
00:37:52,419 --> 00:37:53,670
You little...

583
00:37:57,882 --> 00:38:01,011
- You want it? You want it? Come on.
- Take it easy.

584
00:38:01,094 --> 00:38:02,554
Whoa. Whoa.

585
00:38:02,762 --> 00:38:04,472
Out of my way, assholes.

586
00:38:07,809 --> 00:38:09,769
What's that guy's problem?

587
00:38:09,853 --> 00:38:12,272
That's Rock. He's fucking crazy.

588
00:38:12,355 --> 00:38:13,940
- He plays dirty.
Out of my way, you fucking idiot.

589
00:38:14,023 --> 00:38:16,568
Last year, he bit a chunk out of my thigh.

590
00:38:16,651 --> 00:38:18,069
Jesus!

591
00:38:18,736 --> 00:38:20,864
Hey, his girlfriend's pretty hot.

592
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:25,785
Yeah. And what's with that regular-size guy?

593
00:38:26,244 --> 00:38:30,623
Oh, it's Rock's cousin.
They had to let him in. Legacy.

594
00:38:32,542 --> 00:38:35,336
What a douchebag.

595
00:38:36,087 --> 00:38:37,255
Can he play?

596
00:38:37,922 --> 00:38:40,883
No, he sucks.

597
00:38:52,478 --> 00:38:53,646
Hey, keep your head up.

598
00:38:53,729 --> 00:38:56,274
Whatever, they're midgets.
How bad can it be?

599
00:39:10,246 --> 00:39:11,330
Holy shit!

600
00:39:20,798 --> 00:39:23,342
Keep your head up, bitch.

601
00:39:28,806 --> 00:39:32,518
I told you, man.
Don't underestimate these little bastards.

602
00:39:34,228 --> 00:39:35,521
Down!

603
00:39:35,604 --> 00:39:36,981
Set!

604
00:39:37,523 --> 00:39:38,566
Hut!

605
00:39:58,752 --> 00:40:00,003
Yeah!

606
00:40:41,128 --> 00:40:42,921
- Beta!
- Come on!

607
00:40:43,004 --> 00:40:45,215
Let's go, fellas. Get on the line.

608
00:40:45,882 --> 00:40:47,634
Down!

609
00:40:48,301 --> 00:40:49,803
How you feeling, Stifler?

610
00:40:49,886 --> 00:40:52,514
I'm 6'1", Frodo. How about you?

611
00:40:56,601 --> 00:40:57,644
Hut!

612
00:41:01,898 --> 00:41:03,817
The little fucker's biting me again.

613
00:41:10,949 --> 00:41:12,450
Not in my eye!

614
00:41:20,917 --> 00:41:23,670
Funny, you don't look 6'1" from here,
shit stain.

615
00:41:53,408 --> 00:41:54,534
God,

616
00:41:55,284 --> 00:41:57,495
I hate that fucking guy.

617
00:41:57,578 --> 00:41:59,288
I'm getting killed out there.

618
00:41:59,372 --> 00:42:00,623
I can't get loose.

619
00:42:00,706 --> 00:42:03,835
They're so fast and small.
I don't know what to do.

620
00:42:03,918 --> 00:42:06,087
Quit crying, you bunch
of bra-wearing pussies.

621
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:09,882
I just got a hunk taken out of my leg.
You don't hear me crying.

622
00:42:09,966 --> 00:42:11,717
All right, then, let's put
our balls on the table.

623
00:42:11,801 --> 00:42:15,972
Let's go out there and show these little sons
of bitches what being a Beta's all about.

624
00:42:16,055 --> 00:42:17,890
- You understand what I'm saying, fellas?
- Yeah, yeah.

625
00:42:17,974 --> 00:42:19,767
All right, Beta on three.

626
00:42:20,393 --> 00:42:22,103
- One, two, three, Beta!
Beta!

627
00:42:23,354 --> 00:42:24,563
- Down!
- Set!

628
00:42:25,356 --> 00:42:26,482
Hut!

629
00:42:31,987 --> 00:42:33,030
Go!

630
00:42:36,992 --> 00:42:38,118
Go!

631
00:43:24,289 --> 00:43:25,749
Yeah, yeah. Let's go, boys.

632
00:43:27,167 --> 00:43:29,253
All right, we got five seconds left, guys.

633
00:43:29,336 --> 00:43:32,422
If you're about to get
tackled, lateral it to the nearest guy.

634
00:43:32,506 --> 00:43:34,424
It's our only chance.

635
00:43:34,508 --> 00:43:37,219
All right, let's go now.
Come on, Beta on three.

636
00:43:37,302 --> 00:43:38,345
- Beta on three.
- Who's with me?

637
00:43:38,428 --> 00:43:40,931
- One, two, three, Beta!
Beta!

638
00:43:49,314 --> 00:43:50,690
Down!

639
00:43:53,985 --> 00:43:56,238
Set!

640
00:44:09,918 --> 00:44:10,961
Hut!

641
00:45:17,485 --> 00:45:18,903
We kicked your ass!

642
00:45:20,821 --> 00:45:23,491
You're still my bitch, Stifler.

643
00:45:36,087 --> 00:45:38,464
I can't believe we lost to midgets.

644
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:41,967
Don't let those Oompa Loompa
bastards get to you.

645
00:45:42,259 --> 00:45:46,388
Right now, we have more important matters
to tend to, gentlemen.

646
00:45:46,847 --> 00:45:49,058
From what I understand,

647
00:45:49,141 --> 00:45:52,394
my cousin has a guilt-free pass

648
00:45:52,478 --> 00:45:55,814
to bang all the girls he can find.

649
00:45:56,315 --> 00:45:57,691
That I do.

650
00:45:57,775 --> 00:46:00,611
Oh, that is good news.

651
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:04,448
Christ, for a while
I was starting to think you were adopted.

652
00:46:15,125 --> 00:46:16,460
Gentlemen,

653
00:46:17,878 --> 00:46:21,757
welcome to paradise.

654
00:46:29,556 --> 00:46:31,099
Boys and girls,

655
00:46:31,183 --> 00:46:33,894
we have a celebrity in our midst.

656
00:46:33,977 --> 00:46:37,773
The Heavyweight Drinking Champion
of the World,

657
00:46:37,856 --> 00:46:41,818
Dwight "Iron Liver" Stifler!

658
00:46:51,912 --> 00:46:55,123
All right, you pussy-wipes,
I'm gonna go find some lady friends.

659
00:46:55,207 --> 00:46:58,418
Try not to blow your wad
in the first minute, huh?

660
00:47:00,712 --> 00:47:04,299
There is no way Allison's
party was better than Jimmy's.

661
00:47:04,382 --> 00:47:06,426
You're nuts. Jimmy's party had two kegs

662
00:47:06,509 --> 00:47:09,846
and those two theater chicks
went down on each other on the pool table

663
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:11,556
in front of everybody.

664
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,058
What the hell are you two talking about?

665
00:47:13,141 --> 00:47:14,225
What?

666
00:47:14,309 --> 00:47:17,395
Two kegs, theater chicks. Well, guess what?

667
00:47:17,479 --> 00:47:20,357
We're in a college bar
full of unlimited booze and pussy,

668
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:23,902
and we're sitting
at the bar talking about high-school parties.

669
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:34,454
Ryan? Ryan! What's your problem?

670
00:47:34,537 --> 00:47:36,289
That Great Falls attitude.

671
00:47:36,372 --> 00:47:38,541
All you guys do is talk about Great Falls

672
00:47:38,625 --> 00:47:40,627
like it's the end-all and be-all of existence.

673
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:44,297
The place is a fucking trap,
which is why I'm going to California.

674
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:45,840
I'm not gonna get stuck like the rest of them.

675
00:47:45,924 --> 00:47:47,300
Yeah, I know. I think that's great.

676
00:47:47,383 --> 00:47:51,054
Yeah, but don't you see?
That's what this weekend is about for me.

677
00:47:51,387 --> 00:47:53,222
- What do you mean?
- To see if I can do it.

678
00:47:53,306 --> 00:47:56,851
If I can start over
and accept being low man on the totem pole.

679
00:47:56,934 --> 00:47:58,394
Ryan, it's just a weekend, man.

680
00:47:58,478 --> 00:48:01,314
Maybe to you, but to me
it's a lot more than that.

681
00:48:04,025 --> 00:48:05,526
Man, I sound like a chick.

682
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:06,652
Mmm-hmm.

683
00:48:06,736 --> 00:48:08,196
I really need to go get some pussy.

684
00:48:08,279 --> 00:48:09,363
Yeah.

685
00:48:12,450 --> 00:48:13,534
Oh, shit.

686
00:48:13,618 --> 00:48:15,411
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

687
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:19,290
- No, no, no, no. It's fine.
- I can't believe I did that.

688
00:48:19,373 --> 00:48:20,791
Here, come with me.

689
00:48:23,502 --> 00:48:24,629
Quick, take off your shirt.

690
00:48:24,712 --> 00:48:25,880
Excuse me?

691
00:48:25,963 --> 00:48:28,424
- Well, I just... I wanna get the stain out.
- Oh, yeah, right.

692
00:48:28,507 --> 00:48:29,967
I knew that.

693
00:48:33,471 --> 00:48:34,722
Are we allowed to be back here?

694
00:48:34,805 --> 00:48:36,640
Oh, yeah, don't worry. I used to bartend here.

695
00:48:36,724 --> 00:48:37,975
Cool.

696
00:48:38,517 --> 00:48:41,520
Look, I'm really,
really sorry about this. Right.

697
00:48:44,106 --> 00:48:45,775
Accidents happen.

698
00:48:46,358 --> 00:48:48,486
- I'm Brandy, by the way.
- I'm Erik.

699
00:48:48,569 --> 00:48:51,322
You know, any other
frat asshole would bite my head off right now

700
00:48:51,405 --> 00:48:52,698
if I spilled a drink on him.

701
00:48:52,781 --> 00:48:53,824
I'm...

702
00:48:55,784 --> 00:48:57,244
I'm not in a fraternity.

703
00:48:57,328 --> 00:48:59,413
Oh, you're not? So you're independent?

704
00:48:59,496 --> 00:49:00,581
What's that?

705
00:49:00,664 --> 00:49:02,583
You know, a student who's not Greek.

706
00:49:03,167 --> 00:49:06,712
No, I'm just visiting for the weekend.
I'm a senior in high school.

707
00:49:06,795 --> 00:49:07,921
High school?

708
00:49:08,005 --> 00:49:09,256
Yeah.

709
00:49:12,259 --> 00:49:15,387
Really? Most girls slap me
or kick me in the balls when I say that.

710
00:49:15,471 --> 00:49:17,389
Why? It's hysterical.

711
00:49:17,473 --> 00:49:19,850
That's what I say. What are your names?

712
00:49:19,933 --> 00:49:21,769
I'm Jill and this is Alexis.

713
00:49:21,852 --> 00:49:24,521
Hey, this is my buddy Ryan.

714
00:49:24,605 --> 00:49:26,064
- Hey, Ryan.
- Hey, Ryan.

715
00:49:26,148 --> 00:49:27,524
Hey, ladies.

716
00:49:28,192 --> 00:49:31,320
Amnesty International.
Is that some kind of rock band?

717
00:49:32,529 --> 00:49:35,991
It's an organization that works to protect
human rights all over the world.

718
00:49:36,074 --> 00:49:37,159
Oh, yeah.

719
00:49:37,242 --> 00:49:39,453
Hey, get away
from our dates.

720
00:49:40,287 --> 00:49:42,122
Down here, asshole.

721
00:49:42,623 --> 00:49:43,915
What the hell do you want?

722
00:49:43,999 --> 00:49:45,083
Just what he said.

723
00:49:45,167 --> 00:49:47,461
For you two to get away from our dates.

724
00:49:47,544 --> 00:49:49,504
In your dreams, Willow.

725
00:49:49,588 --> 00:49:52,591
There is no way these girls are here with you.

726
00:49:54,634 --> 00:49:55,886
Are you?

727
00:49:58,221 --> 00:50:00,056
- But why?
- They're cool.

728
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:01,308
And sexy.

729
00:50:02,017 --> 00:50:04,019
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

730
00:50:05,228 --> 00:50:07,230
Ain't nobody kidding around here, punk.

731
00:50:07,314 --> 00:50:09,524
If you got a problem,
we could settle this right here.

732
00:50:09,608 --> 00:50:11,193
Oh, I would love to.

733
00:50:11,276 --> 00:50:13,153
Okay, stop it, you guys.

734
00:50:13,987 --> 00:50:18,408
Listen, it was really nice meeting you two,
but we're spoken for tonight.

735
00:50:19,284 --> 00:50:21,369
Come on, baby, let's dance.

736
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:34,382
That did not just happen.

737
00:50:39,053 --> 00:50:43,224
Time for a Stifler blowjob!

738
00:50:46,019 --> 00:50:50,940
Oh, get sexy, ladies, I love it.
Oh, I feel a stirring in my loins.

739
00:50:56,237 --> 00:50:57,947
You've gotta meet my roommate.

740
00:50:59,782 --> 00:51:02,076
I would love to.

741
00:51:02,535 --> 00:51:05,329
Dude, the fucking midgets
just stole our women.

742
00:51:05,413 --> 00:51:06,789
Yeah, those fuckers are
out of hand.

743
00:51:06,873 --> 00:51:11,627
I told you guys,
don't underestimate those little bastards.

744
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:15,840
That midget quarterback
stole my girlfriend last year.

745
00:51:18,134 --> 00:51:19,218
Slut!

746
00:51:19,302 --> 00:51:21,220
Out of my goddamn way.

747
00:51:23,347 --> 00:51:24,891
Holy shit!

748
00:51:25,725 --> 00:51:29,312
I thought this place had a no-loser policy.
What are you assholes doing here?

749
00:51:29,395 --> 00:51:30,813
Fuck off, Mighty Mouse.

750
00:51:30,896 --> 00:51:34,609
Man, don't take it out on me
because your ladies like it short and thick,

751
00:51:34,692 --> 00:51:36,819
rather than tall and skinny.

752
00:51:39,989 --> 00:51:43,784
Rock, don't you know, baby?
This bar is like a roller coaster.

753
00:51:43,909 --> 00:51:45,494
Yeah, it has a height requirement,

754
00:51:45,578 --> 00:51:49,707
- and I'm afraid you just don't measure up!
- Motherfucker.

755
00:51:51,333 --> 00:51:53,878
- Easy! Easy! Easy!
- Whoa!

756
00:51:53,961 --> 00:51:55,254
This isn't over, Shitler.

757
00:51:55,337 --> 00:51:57,214
Oh, you got that right!

758
00:51:58,966 --> 00:52:01,760
Never get in my way, woman.

759
00:52:10,019 --> 00:52:11,395
What's up?

760
00:52:16,525 --> 00:52:17,693
Bitch.

761
00:52:20,362 --> 00:52:21,530
That did not happen.

762
00:52:21,613 --> 00:52:24,825
I swear to God, I was running
through the streets with nylons on my head

763
00:52:24,908 --> 00:52:26,910
and the condom still on.

764
00:52:27,244 --> 00:52:28,954
I can't believe I just told you that story.

765
00:52:29,037 --> 00:52:30,414
I think it's great.

766
00:52:30,497 --> 00:52:34,126
I mean, think of it this way,
you'll never forget your first time.

767
00:52:34,209 --> 00:52:35,836
Well, it wasn't...

768
00:52:36,128 --> 00:52:37,254
Technically...

769
00:52:37,337 --> 00:52:38,839
Oh, no, wait.

770
00:52:38,922 --> 00:52:42,426
- You mean you didn't even get to...
- He came down too fast.

771
00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:46,305
Thank you.
Thank you for laughing at my misfortune.

772
00:52:47,306 --> 00:52:51,059
I think you're a sweetheart.
And you're really cute.

773
00:52:52,227 --> 00:52:53,603
This is me.

774
00:52:55,105 --> 00:52:57,024
So, are you guys
running the Mile tomorrow?

775
00:52:57,107 --> 00:53:00,652
I don't know. There's something about
running naked down the street

776
00:53:00,736 --> 00:53:02,696
while you're still a virgin...

777
00:53:02,779 --> 00:53:04,239
Didn't stop you before.

778
00:53:04,322 --> 00:53:05,782
Touch.

779
00:53:06,116 --> 00:53:08,827
You never know, that virgin thing,

780
00:53:09,452 --> 00:53:12,664
it could totally change
by the end of the weekend.

781
00:53:15,166 --> 00:53:16,793
Thanks for walking me home.

782
00:53:39,232 --> 00:53:42,068
What the hell happened to you last night?

783
00:53:43,236 --> 00:53:44,404
What's up, fellas?

784
00:53:44,487 --> 00:53:45,697
What's up?

785
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:49,367
What's up is we got
cock-blocked by some midgets at the bar.

786
00:53:49,450 --> 00:53:52,537
Cooze, never mind that.
Where the hell were you?

787
00:53:52,787 --> 00:53:57,333
Well, Mother,
if you must know, I was with a girl.

788
00:54:01,087 --> 00:54:02,797
Bullshit. What girl?

789
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,466
Her name is Brandy.
She's in a sorority and she's hot,

790
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:07,969
and I'm supposed to meet her
at the Mile tonight.

791
00:54:08,678 --> 00:54:10,471
Dude, I don't get it.

792
00:54:10,638 --> 00:54:14,934
We come to college,
we get blown off by chicks for midgets,

793
00:54:15,017 --> 00:54:17,895
and you're hanging out with a sorority girl?

794
00:54:17,979 --> 00:54:20,398
What the fuck is going on here?

795
00:54:20,773 --> 00:54:23,151
So, what are you gonna do?

796
00:54:24,110 --> 00:54:27,071
What do you mean?
He's gonna bang that chick.

797
00:54:28,739 --> 00:54:30,032
Aren't you?

798
00:54:30,116 --> 00:54:31,409
What?

799
00:54:33,869 --> 00:54:34,996
Yeah.

800
00:54:35,246 --> 00:54:38,958
Yeah, of course I will.
I'm on a guilt-free pass, why wouldn't I?

801
00:54:39,041 --> 00:54:41,002
Why the hesitation, man?

802
00:54:42,003 --> 00:54:45,089
- Oh, shit! You're not gonna do it.
- I said I'll do it.

803
00:54:45,172 --> 00:54:48,884
Erik, you've been given a gift from above.
Don't fuck it up.

804
00:54:49,009 --> 00:54:50,136
I won't.

805
00:54:50,219 --> 00:54:51,345
Yes, you will.

806
00:54:51,429 --> 00:54:52,471
No.

807
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:55,433
I... I gotta get out of here.

808
00:55:16,787 --> 00:55:17,913
Hello?

809
00:55:17,997 --> 00:55:19,623
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

810
00:55:21,667 --> 00:55:23,502
Calling to see how you're doing.

811
00:55:23,585 --> 00:55:24,837
I'm fine,

812
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:27,047
<i>- I'm just studying.
- Okay.</i>

813
00:55:28,757 --> 00:55:29,800
Cool.

814
00:55:29,883 --> 00:55:33,178
So, did you guys decide
if you're gonna run in the Naked Mile?

815
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:37,391
No, not yet.
But you know me, I'll probably just wimp out.

816
00:55:37,683 --> 00:55:39,268
I mean, you don't have to.

817
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:41,395
Yeah, I know.

818
00:55:42,104 --> 00:55:44,565
Are you okay?
I mean, you sound a little weird.

819
00:55:45,107 --> 00:55:46,400
I'm fine.

820
00:55:47,484 --> 00:55:49,987
I'm fine. I just wanted to call and say hello.

821
00:55:50,070 --> 00:55:54,741
Thanks, but you don't need to check in.
I mean, go, have fun.

822
00:55:54,825 --> 00:55:57,202
That's what this weekend's all about.

823
00:55:58,578 --> 00:55:59,830
You're the greatest.

824
00:56:11,883 --> 00:56:13,301
Erik Stifler.

825
00:56:16,847 --> 00:56:19,266
- Hey, Mr. Levenstein.
- Hello, Erik, good to see you.

826
00:56:19,349 --> 00:56:22,978
Yeah. Wow, I haven't seen you
since my parents' New Year's party, right?

827
00:56:23,061 --> 00:56:26,856
Yes, well, your folks really,
really know how to ring in the new year.

828
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:30,819
Look, I'm sorry about my dad
giving you that wedgie in front of everybody.

829
00:56:30,902 --> 00:56:34,197
Well, your dad's been doing
that to me since we were kids,

830
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:36,741
and strangely enough, I enjoy it.

831
00:56:39,994 --> 00:56:42,372
So, what are you doing up here?

832
00:56:43,498 --> 00:56:46,167
Oh, well, I went to school here

833
00:56:46,251 --> 00:56:50,046
and, you know, I like to come
back every now and then

834
00:56:50,505 --> 00:56:51,965
and check out the campus.

835
00:56:52,048 --> 00:56:56,261
That's the only reason I'm here.
No other reason that I can think of.

836
00:56:56,344 --> 00:56:59,138
And what about you?
What are you doing here?

837
00:56:59,639 --> 00:57:01,724
Actually, it's kind of personal.

838
00:57:01,808 --> 00:57:04,143
- Oh. Well, say no more.
- Okay.

839
00:57:04,227 --> 00:57:05,395
Okay, listen, good seeing you.

840
00:57:05,478 --> 00:57:07,230
Yeah, for sure.

841
00:57:13,027 --> 00:57:15,279
Mr. Levenstein, you were a counselor

842
00:57:15,363 --> 00:57:17,573
at Tall Oaks Band Camp
with my cousin, Matt, right?

843
00:57:17,657 --> 00:57:21,119
Yes. Yes, I was. And your cousin Matt
needed some counseling...

844
00:57:21,202 --> 00:57:24,997
- Yeah.
...I might add. I gave him some advice.

845
00:57:25,081 --> 00:57:28,042
Advice. Do you think I could

846
00:57:30,545 --> 00:57:32,547
confide something in you?

847
00:57:32,839 --> 00:57:35,675
Well, sure. Yes, Erik, anything. Anything.

848
00:57:35,758 --> 00:57:36,926
Okay.

849
00:57:37,802 --> 00:57:38,844
I'm a virgin.

850
00:57:38,928 --> 00:57:40,263
Okay, can I stop you there?

851
00:57:40,346 --> 00:57:43,516
You're a Stifler and a virgin?

852
00:57:45,059 --> 00:57:46,185
Yeah.

853
00:57:48,145 --> 00:57:51,607
Well, so you're a virgin. What's the big deal?

854
00:57:52,358 --> 00:57:56,904
Well, the other night, my girlfriend and I...
We tried to, you know...

855
00:57:59,031 --> 00:58:02,535
Right. But her father
came down before we had the chance to.

856
00:58:02,618 --> 00:58:04,954
So she changed her mind
completely about the sex,

857
00:58:05,037 --> 00:58:08,123
but she gave me a guilt-free
pass for the weekend.

858
00:58:08,207 --> 00:58:10,543
You got the guilt-free pass?

859
00:58:12,169 --> 00:58:13,796
What do you mean?

860
00:58:14,046 --> 00:58:19,009
Well, I mean,
you've got the old guilt-free pass dilemma.

861
00:58:19,218 --> 00:58:20,886
- Yeah.
- It's a tough one.

862
00:58:20,970 --> 00:58:23,180
I didn't think people your age
knew about that kind of stuff.

863
00:58:23,263 --> 00:58:26,350
I believe I know more
about this than you think.

864
00:58:27,935 --> 00:58:30,729
Good, because I just
don't know what to do here.

865
00:58:30,813 --> 00:58:34,483
I mean, I've got
this smoking-hot sorority girl all over me.

866
00:58:35,567 --> 00:58:38,737
Well, you know, my son Jim

867
00:58:38,821 --> 00:58:41,031
went through kind of a similar dilemma.

868
00:58:41,115 --> 00:58:42,991
He was going out with this very attractive

869
00:58:43,075 --> 00:58:45,035
foreign-exchange student named Nadia.

870
00:58:45,118 --> 00:58:48,539
Right, right, yeah. That's the one he blew his
load too early with, right?

871
00:58:48,622 --> 00:58:49,748
- Yes.
- Twice.

872
00:58:49,831 --> 00:58:51,166
- Yes.
- Over the Internet.

873
00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:52,918
- Yes, that's the one.
- Yeah.

874
00:58:53,001 --> 00:58:56,338
Well, blowing loads aside...

875
00:58:56,421 --> 00:58:57,506
Yeah.

876
00:58:57,589 --> 00:58:59,925
The next summer Nadia came
to visit Jim at the beach,

877
00:59:00,008 --> 00:59:01,468
and he turned her down

878
00:59:01,551 --> 00:59:04,930
because he had fallen in love with Michelle,

879
00:59:05,764 --> 00:59:09,768
who he later married,
and is now the mother of my grandchild.

880
00:59:11,061 --> 00:59:14,856
So you're saying
I shouldn't hook up with this sorority girl?

881
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:18,360
I'm saying I think
only you know the answer to that, Erik.

882
00:59:20,946 --> 00:59:22,531
Well, gotta run.

883
00:59:25,575 --> 00:59:29,246
Oh, Erik, I was sorry to hear
about your grandmother.

884
00:59:48,348 --> 00:59:50,266
Last night was amazing.

885
00:59:50,809 --> 00:59:52,852
Yeah, it was.

886
00:59:52,936 --> 00:59:55,855
The three of us should
do it again sometime.

887
00:59:56,231 --> 00:59:57,607
Definitely.

888
00:59:59,901 --> 01:00:01,277
Definitely.

889
01:00:08,534 --> 01:00:12,205
Hey, buddy.
You know how to get to Murray Street?

890
01:00:12,288 --> 01:00:15,750
Oh, yeah, man.
Just go right down Maryland, down to...

891
01:00:16,417 --> 01:00:17,835
What the...

892
01:00:19,796 --> 01:00:21,255
<i>What is this? Enter the Midget?</i>

893
01:00:21,339 --> 01:00:24,008
It's little people, asshole.

894
01:00:25,635 --> 01:00:27,345
Come get some.

895
01:00:28,387 --> 01:00:30,681
Come get some, baby!

896
01:00:40,983 --> 01:00:42,860
Midgets jumped Stifler.

897
01:00:42,944 --> 01:00:44,195
- What?
- What?

898
01:00:45,196 --> 01:00:47,365
The midgets jumped Stifler.

899
01:00:47,823 --> 01:00:49,575
He's in the hospital right now.

900
01:00:54,497 --> 01:00:55,831
Oh, shit.

901
01:00:55,915 --> 01:00:57,667
Holy shit.

902
01:00:58,668 --> 01:01:00,544
Man, he is fucked up.

903
01:01:01,504 --> 01:01:02,963
First Grandma, and now this.

904
01:01:03,047 --> 01:01:04,423
All right, we gotta get
those fucking midgets.

905
01:01:04,507 --> 01:01:05,591
Yeah, man.

906
01:01:05,674 --> 01:01:09,178
Jesus, Ryan, keep it down, will you?
I got a huge fucking headache.

907
01:01:09,261 --> 01:01:11,388
We thought this guy was you.

908
01:01:12,473 --> 01:01:13,724
Fuck, no.

909
01:01:14,642 --> 01:01:15,893
I don't know what happened to that pussy.

910
01:01:16,852 --> 01:01:18,812
Hey, man, what the hell happened?

911
01:01:18,896 --> 01:01:22,650
Rock and his boys jumped me,
wearing all black and ski masks.

912
01:01:22,733 --> 01:01:24,151
Like I wouldn't know it was them.

913
01:01:24,235 --> 01:01:27,529
Are you all right?
Are you gonna be able to run in the Mile?

914
01:01:27,613 --> 01:01:28,906
Doesn't look like it.

915
01:01:29,531 --> 01:01:33,035
Doc says the Stif-man's gonna be laid up
for at least a couple of more days.

916
01:01:33,118 --> 01:01:35,371
Hey, don't worry.
We will find those little fuckers.

917
01:01:35,454 --> 01:01:40,334
No. I appreciate it, okay?
Stifler'll think of something.

918
01:01:40,959 --> 01:01:44,505
Now you guys are up here
to do two things: Have fun,

919
01:01:44,588 --> 01:01:46,632
and run naked

920
01:01:46,715 --> 01:01:50,677
with hundreds of hot,
big-breasted, horny women.

921
01:01:50,761 --> 01:01:51,970
You understand?

922
01:01:52,054 --> 01:01:53,180
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

923
01:01:53,263 --> 01:01:56,975
Good. Now get the fuck
out of here so I can get some sleep.

924
01:02:02,064 --> 01:02:04,566
Hey, Erik, stick around for a second.

925
01:02:04,650 --> 01:02:05,692
Yeah.

926
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:09,071
Listen, I know what you're going through.

927
01:02:09,696 --> 01:02:12,657
- You do?
- Sure, yeah. I had the same problem

928
01:02:12,908 --> 01:02:15,035
when I was in middle school.

929
01:02:15,494 --> 01:02:18,830
But living up to
the family name is not an easy thing, man.

930
01:02:18,914 --> 01:02:21,500
Yeah. What did you do?

931
01:02:23,627 --> 01:02:27,422
Well, I whipped out
my dick in class, stole the principal's car,

932
01:02:27,506 --> 01:02:29,090
and then I fucked a lunch lady.

933
01:02:29,716 --> 01:02:30,759
Oh.

934
01:02:31,218 --> 01:02:32,719
But, hey, that's me.

935
01:02:33,595 --> 01:02:35,597
What do you think I should do?

936
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:40,268
It's not for me to decide or advise.
You gotta figure that out on your own.

937
01:02:40,477 --> 01:02:44,147
But I will say this.
We got a pretty fucked-up family,

938
01:02:44,856 --> 01:02:47,400
and it's nice having a guy like you around.

939
01:02:50,862 --> 01:02:52,530
Now, seriously, go.

940
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:05,668
All I have to say is,

941
01:03:05,752 --> 01:03:09,130
thank you, Dad,
for getting my dumb ass into this school.

942
01:03:15,011 --> 01:03:18,598
Gentlemen, we have officially
arrived at our destination.

943
01:03:28,816 --> 01:03:31,152
Look who decided to show up.

944
01:03:31,235 --> 01:03:33,362
I didn't think you guys
would have the balls for this.

945
01:03:33,446 --> 01:03:34,614
I guess I was right.

946
01:03:34,864 --> 01:03:38,242
Check it out. They still got their clothes on.

947
01:03:41,329 --> 01:03:46,292
Where is old Shitler? I guess the king of
the Naked Mile didn't make it this year.

948
01:03:47,335 --> 01:03:50,671
Nobody starts this fucking
Naked Mile without me!

949
01:04:02,850 --> 01:04:06,896
The king has arrived! Bring out your titties!

950
01:04:09,982 --> 01:04:13,903
You really think that little beating
you gave me could keep me away?

951
01:04:13,986 --> 01:04:17,031
You and the Lollypop Guild
punch like a bunch of five-year-olds.

952
01:04:17,114 --> 01:04:19,867
This is my fucking school.

953
01:04:23,162 --> 01:04:24,330
Guys.

954
01:04:25,414 --> 01:04:28,500
Right, screw those guys.
We're here to have fun, right?

955
01:04:28,584 --> 01:04:31,003
Oh, fucking-A-right,
we're here to have some fun.

956
01:04:32,296 --> 01:04:35,883
Hey, why the hell
do you guys still have your clothes on?

957
01:04:36,634 --> 01:04:38,427
Listen, Stifler, we were talking and...

958
01:04:38,510 --> 01:04:40,637
Hey, Stifler. I like your IVs.

959
01:04:42,389 --> 01:04:43,891
Hello, ladies.

960
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:47,352
Looking sexy as always.

961
01:04:47,436 --> 01:04:49,062
Heard you were in the hospital.

962
01:04:49,605 --> 01:04:52,065
Just a little beating by a bunch of midgets.

963
01:04:52,149 --> 01:04:53,567
Hey, Cooze.

964
01:04:53,650 --> 01:04:57,404
Jill the Thrill. Back on the Cooze radar.

965
01:05:02,117 --> 01:05:03,243
Hey, Erik.

966
01:05:03,952 --> 01:05:04,995
Hey, Brandy.

967
01:05:05,287 --> 01:05:06,997
- Ryan.
- Alexis.

968
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:09,333
So, you ladies ready to run this Mile

969
01:05:09,416 --> 01:05:12,586
and get extra fucking sexy?

970
01:05:12,753 --> 01:05:13,837
- Hell, yeah!
- Hell, yeah!

971
01:05:13,962 --> 01:05:15,505
What about you guys?

972
01:05:15,589 --> 01:05:17,507
Yeah, what are you guys doing still dressed?

973
01:05:17,799 --> 01:05:19,968
Well, we figured we'd just watch the Mile

974
01:05:20,052 --> 01:05:21,678
and then meet you guys
at the party afterwards.

975
01:05:21,762 --> 01:05:25,390
That's too bad 'cause this
Naked Mile is gonna be crazy.

976
01:05:25,515 --> 01:05:28,059
Really crazy. Right, Brandy?

977
01:05:28,143 --> 01:05:29,644
Absolutely out of control.

978
01:05:46,703 --> 01:05:49,664
Yeah! That's what
I'm fucking talking about, boys.

979
01:05:49,748 --> 01:05:53,043
Set the cocks free!

980
01:05:53,126 --> 01:05:55,462
Let's huddle up over here. Come on, fellas.

981
01:05:56,713 --> 01:05:57,797
Cock huddle.

982
01:05:58,006 --> 01:05:59,340
All right, bitch tits.

983
01:05:59,966 --> 01:06:02,135
I got a little surprise for you fuckers.

984
01:06:02,218 --> 01:06:03,261
What do you got?

985
01:06:04,471 --> 01:06:07,682
Just a little pharmaceutical delight for later.

986
01:06:08,766 --> 01:06:11,352
Stifler! You uncircumcised twat!

987
01:06:11,436 --> 01:06:13,855
Jackson, you little-dicked motherfucker.

988
01:06:13,938 --> 01:06:15,023
What is this?

989
01:06:15,106 --> 01:06:16,482
It looks like some kind of E.

990
01:06:16,566 --> 01:06:18,818
- Should we take it now?
- He said save it for later.

991
01:06:18,902 --> 01:06:21,237
Fuck that!
I'm about to run naked through the streets.

992
01:06:21,446 --> 01:06:23,406
I need all the drug-induced courage
I can get.

993
01:06:26,326 --> 01:06:28,077
I'm so glad you guys decided to run.

994
01:06:28,161 --> 01:06:29,912
You must work out.

995
01:06:29,996 --> 01:06:32,123
Yeah, well, I play football.

996
01:06:32,206 --> 01:06:34,292
I love football players.

997
01:06:34,459 --> 01:06:36,461
Did anybody ever tell you
that you have a nice ass?

998
01:06:37,462 --> 01:06:38,504
That guy's a prick!

999
01:06:38,963 --> 01:06:41,382
Hey, Stifler, is this supposed
to be some pretty good E?

1000
01:06:41,799 --> 01:06:42,884
What E?

1001
01:06:43,384 --> 01:06:45,136
The pills you gave us.

1002
01:06:46,095 --> 01:06:47,597
Oh, shit! You retards.

1003
01:06:47,805 --> 01:06:50,975
That's not E.
It's that fucking four-hour hard-on drug.

1004
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:53,019
- Oh, shit.
I scored some at the hospital.

1005
01:06:53,102 --> 01:06:55,563
I thought you limp-dicked
bitches could use some.

1006
01:06:55,897 --> 01:06:57,815
- Oh, God.
- Holy fuck, you didn't...

1007
01:06:57,899 --> 01:06:59,442
Holy shit!

1008
01:06:59,817 --> 01:07:04,030
I don't think I can talk this one down, man.
It's got a mind of its own.

1009
01:07:04,196 --> 01:07:06,782
Hey, do not run behind me. Okay?

1010
01:07:07,450 --> 01:07:10,036
It's... It's just that we thought that it was...

1011
01:07:10,119 --> 01:07:12,413
Honey, don't apologize.

1012
01:07:12,496 --> 01:07:14,582
Yeah, you guys are running with us.

1013
01:07:14,665 --> 01:07:18,794
Oh, man!
This is going to be the best Naked Mile ever!

1014
01:07:19,086 --> 01:07:20,337
Good evening...

1015
01:07:24,383 --> 01:07:25,467
Who is that guy?

1016
01:07:25,551 --> 01:07:29,305
That is big, bad Noah Levenstein.

1017
01:07:30,264 --> 01:07:34,351
The craziest bastard
this campus has ever known.

1018
01:07:34,435 --> 01:07:36,061
<i>My bad. My bad. Welcome to the Naked Mile.</i>

1019
01:07:41,775 --> 01:07:44,403
<i>Yes, you know, when I started this race
many, many...</i>

1020
01:07:44,486 --> 01:07:46,488
Christ, he started this whole
thing back in the '60s.

1021
01:07:46,572 --> 01:07:49,742
<i>...many years ago.
It was just... Just a passive protest.</i>

1022
01:07:49,992 --> 01:07:54,121
<i>Just a way to "stick it
to the man," so to speak.</i>

1023
01:07:55,497 --> 01:07:57,291
<i>Right on. Right on.</i>

1024
01:07:57,833 --> 01:08:01,753
<i>But over the years,
it's become somewhat less political.</i>

1025
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:05,215
<i>And now, it's just</i>

1026
01:08:05,299 --> 01:08:07,968
<i>some sort of Roman orgy,</i>

1027
01:08:08,218 --> 01:08:11,013
<i>which I'm down with, by the way.</i>

1028
01:08:11,430 --> 01:08:13,640
<i>But let's keep one thing in mind.</i>

1029
01:08:13,932 --> 01:08:18,353
<i>This is about
showing the world your youthful exuberance,</i>

1030
01:08:18,603 --> 01:08:22,024
<i>and your unabashed commitment
to higher learning,</i>

1031
01:08:22,107 --> 01:08:24,568
<i>and having fun while you're doing it,</i>

1032
01:08:24,651 --> 01:08:28,655
<i>which is where the naked part comes in.</i>

1033
01:08:28,739 --> 01:08:30,365
Yeah!

1034
01:08:34,327 --> 01:08:37,372
<i>And being completely naked is, of course,</i>

1035
01:08:37,456 --> 01:08:39,499
<i>a perfectly natural thing.</i>

1036
01:08:39,666 --> 01:08:43,378
<i>There's not one part of one's body</i>

1037
01:08:43,461 --> 01:08:45,672
<i>one should be ashamed of,</i>

1038
01:08:45,755 --> 01:08:50,385
<i>be it one's pubic region</i>

1039
01:08:50,552 --> 01:08:52,846
<i>or one's breasts,</i>

1040
01:08:53,179 --> 01:08:55,348
<i>as in the case with you young ladies...</i>

1041
01:08:59,936 --> 01:09:03,356
<i>...and a couple of you young men.</i>

1042
01:09:05,859 --> 01:09:09,154
<i>But you should all just revel
in the glory of being seen</i>

1043
01:09:09,362 --> 01:09:11,489
<i>as the people you are.</i>

1044
01:09:11,698 --> 01:09:13,241
<i>Incidentally, if anyone has anything...</i>

1045
01:09:13,324 --> 01:09:15,326
Come on, let's fucking do this!

1046
01:09:18,746 --> 01:09:20,498
<i>I second that motion, young man.</i>

1047
01:09:20,790 --> 01:09:23,334
<i>Okay, everybody ready.</i>

1048
01:09:25,461 --> 01:09:27,130
<i>Get set...</i>

1049
01:09:56,868 --> 01:09:58,202
Still going?

1050
01:09:58,286 --> 01:10:00,162
You know it, baby. Hell, yeah!

1051
01:10:01,205 --> 01:10:03,082
You love the Boss Hogg!

1052
01:10:20,099 --> 01:10:23,602
All right, yeah. Look at this.
Look at all these teats.

1053
01:10:23,686 --> 01:10:28,065
I'm adrift in a sea of boobies,
and my balls are scraping the pavement.

1054
01:10:28,149 --> 01:10:29,233
Oh, heads up.

1055
01:10:33,070 --> 01:10:34,947
Look, its the boner guys.

1056
01:10:36,198 --> 01:10:37,867
Nice cocks.

1057
01:10:37,950 --> 01:10:39,910
Oh, you got that right, sexy.

1058
01:10:39,994 --> 01:10:42,079
Dude, you have serious issues.

1059
01:11:25,122 --> 01:11:27,332
Hey, naked people only!

1060
01:12:01,491 --> 01:12:03,159
Are you all right?

1061
01:12:03,243 --> 01:12:04,703
I'm fine.

1062
01:12:04,953 --> 01:12:06,997
Come on, sweetie. Let's finish this thing.

1063
01:12:16,631 --> 01:12:20,051
I'm standing at the finish
line of a very proud, but strange tradition

1064
01:12:20,135 --> 01:12:21,344
called the Naked Mile.

1065
01:12:21,427 --> 01:12:22,804
Ever year after exams

1066
01:12:22,887 --> 01:12:25,265
hundreds of students
run a mile through campus

1067
01:12:25,348 --> 01:12:27,392
in nothing more than their birthday suits.

1068
01:12:31,646 --> 01:12:34,732
This is the greatest thing ever!

1069
01:12:34,816 --> 01:12:36,859
Hell, yeah!

1070
01:12:36,943 --> 01:12:39,070
I can't believe we did this!

1071
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:42,573
Yeah! Naked Mile, baby!

1072
01:12:43,032 --> 01:12:45,201
Beta House fucking rules!

1073
01:12:52,083 --> 01:12:56,129
Come on, marathon men.
Let's get ready for the party.

1074
01:12:57,588 --> 01:12:59,590
I did it. I really did it.

1075
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:04,262
Way to go, Coz. That's my cousin.

1076
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:07,974
Yeah, buddy!

1077
01:13:08,266 --> 01:13:10,268
Some people call it lewd behavior,

1078
01:13:10,434 --> 01:13:13,312
but the students say it's just
a good way to blow off steam.

1079
01:13:13,604 --> 01:13:14,730
And maybe,

1080
01:13:18,859 --> 01:13:20,152
<i>find love.</i>

1081
01:13:20,528 --> 01:13:23,072
<i>This is Hal Michaels,
reporting from the Naked Mile.</i>

1082
01:13:59,483 --> 01:14:02,319
Stifler has arrived!

1083
01:14:11,328 --> 01:14:13,038
Yeah! Yeah!

1084
01:14:14,331 --> 01:14:17,209
Holy shit! Is this even the same house?

1085
01:14:21,380 --> 01:14:24,174
I think I had a wet dream
that started like this.

1086
01:14:24,591 --> 01:14:25,842
It's those guys.

1087
01:14:31,139 --> 01:14:32,349
And ended like that.

1088
01:14:32,432 --> 01:14:33,767
Wow, taking those pills

1089
01:14:33,850 --> 01:14:36,853
might just be the best thing
you guys ever did for your social lives.

1090
01:14:36,937 --> 01:14:38,063
Oh, yeah.

1091
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:39,564
You wanna dance?

1092
01:14:40,357 --> 01:14:43,902
Is my dick hard?
Of course the Cooze wants to dance.

1093
01:14:46,863 --> 01:14:48,448
Are you gonna dance, sexy?

1094
01:14:48,532 --> 01:14:50,951
Or are you one of those
football players who's too cool to dance?

1095
01:14:51,034 --> 01:14:54,162
Oh, baby, they don't call me
the White Shadow for nothing.

1096
01:14:59,793 --> 01:15:01,294
Come on, cutie.

1097
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:03,296
What a bastard.

1098
01:15:03,380 --> 01:15:06,633
I told you to call off
that stupid guilt-free pass.

1099
01:15:07,092 --> 01:15:09,260
I'm so sorry, honey.

1100
01:15:09,552 --> 01:15:11,429
Is there anything we can do for you?

1101
01:15:12,013 --> 01:15:14,099
No, I think I just want to be alone.

1102
01:15:14,182 --> 01:15:17,352
No way. We are not leaving you alone
so you can beat yourself up.

1103
01:15:17,435 --> 01:15:20,230
Yeah, but I told him to do it.
I mean, I can't get mad about it now.

1104
01:15:20,313 --> 01:15:23,274
Would you quit being so logical, Tracy?
We're girls.

1105
01:15:23,358 --> 01:15:25,652
Boys should know better
than to trust us to be rational.

1106
01:15:25,735 --> 01:15:26,820
It's not in our nature.

1107
01:15:26,903 --> 01:15:28,530
It's really not.

1108
01:15:28,613 --> 01:15:32,325
So, you are going to get dressed.

1109
01:15:32,408 --> 01:15:34,160
Then, we're going to Allison's party.

1110
01:15:34,744 --> 01:15:36,996
That will get your mind off of Erik.

1111
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:38,748
I don't want to.

1112
01:15:38,831 --> 01:15:42,251
Well, you don't have a vote in this.
Now get dressed.

1113
01:15:54,555 --> 01:15:57,809
Check out our boy.
Think he's going to lose it tonight?

1114
01:15:57,892 --> 01:16:01,771
Nope. Bet he screws it up
and ends up jerking off in the bathroom.

1115
01:16:01,854 --> 01:16:03,439
I'll bet 20 bucks says he nails her.

1116
01:16:04,690 --> 01:16:05,900
Oh, you're on.

1117
01:16:09,237 --> 01:16:11,239
Hey, hard-on brothers.

1118
01:16:11,322 --> 01:16:14,742
Do you guys have any idea how much
everybody here has been talking about you?

1119
01:16:14,825 --> 01:16:16,452
I was getting that feeling.

1120
01:16:16,535 --> 01:16:17,620
Yeah!

1121
01:16:18,663 --> 01:16:21,165
Okay, listen up, 'cause I got a plan

1122
01:16:21,248 --> 01:16:25,169
that's gonna make you guys legends.

1123
01:16:31,425 --> 01:16:33,177
Ladies and gentlemen!

1124
01:16:33,469 --> 01:16:37,890
Give a big Beta House welcome
to Ryan "Steel Rod" Grimm

1125
01:16:38,182 --> 01:16:43,020
and Mike "Everhard" Coozeman!

1126
01:16:43,103 --> 01:16:44,980
Yeah, Cooze!

1127
01:16:48,859 --> 01:16:52,321
Tonight is the dawning of a new era

1128
01:16:52,404 --> 01:16:54,531
in meaningless male competition.

1129
01:16:54,615 --> 01:16:59,578
The Heavyweight Hard-On
Championship of the World!

1130
01:17:04,792 --> 01:17:07,294
For the first phase of the competition,

1131
01:17:07,378 --> 01:17:10,839
a bucket will be hung
on the dong of each of our contestants.

1132
01:17:10,923 --> 01:17:14,259
That bucket will be filled
with a pitcher of beer.

1133
01:17:14,343 --> 01:17:18,305
First person to drop the bucket is the loser.

1134
01:17:20,015 --> 01:17:22,059
So let the penis games begin!

1135
01:17:33,862 --> 01:17:37,199
Commence the pouring!

1136
01:17:43,413 --> 01:17:44,581
You like that?

1137
01:17:44,664 --> 01:17:46,083
Oh, yeah, baby!

1138
01:18:04,267 --> 01:18:07,562
Oh, I am so sorry about that!

1139
01:18:11,316 --> 01:18:12,692
Still good.

1140
01:18:29,959 --> 01:18:32,212
Next competition.

1141
01:18:34,589 --> 01:18:36,549
The ring toss.

1142
01:18:37,091 --> 01:18:38,968
- Let's have it, girls.
- Come on.

1143
01:18:43,473 --> 01:18:45,850
That's right! On that penis!

1144
01:18:45,934 --> 01:18:47,936
Come on, baby, just like Six Flags.

1145
01:18:51,022 --> 01:18:52,398
Wrong head!

1146
01:18:56,694 --> 01:18:58,529
Ring around the cocksy.

1147
01:19:00,531 --> 01:19:02,658
You needed an extra inch on that one.

1148
01:19:12,376 --> 01:19:13,920
Can you believe this?

1149
01:19:14,837 --> 01:19:16,505
Do not let Cooze win.

1150
01:19:21,052 --> 01:19:22,970
Next competition!

1151
01:19:29,352 --> 01:19:31,729
I got a nine-inch strike zone, baby.

1152
01:19:31,812 --> 01:19:34,357
- You cocky prick.
- You can't miss it!

1153
01:19:40,154 --> 01:19:41,655
It's a hardball, son!

1154
01:19:41,739 --> 01:19:43,157
Hey, boner, boner, boner.

1155
01:19:43,699 --> 01:19:45,034
Swing, boner!

1156
01:19:45,117 --> 01:19:46,660
Deep center, baby!

1157
01:19:52,416 --> 01:19:54,126
Foul ball!

1158
01:20:08,307 --> 01:20:09,350
Bunt.

1159
01:20:20,027 --> 01:20:22,863
That is it. We're calling it a tie.

1160
01:20:22,946 --> 01:20:25,574
Your Co-Hard-on Champions of the World,

1161
01:20:25,657 --> 01:20:29,411
Ryan "Steel Rod" Grimm
and Mike "Everhard" Coozeman!

1162
01:20:46,303 --> 01:20:50,640
Fifty-six, fifty-seven, fifty-eight, fifty-nine...

1163
01:20:55,896 --> 01:20:58,356
Who's the fuckin' champ, baby?

1164
01:22:17,393 --> 01:22:18,895
Boys are a bad influence.

1165
01:22:18,978 --> 01:22:22,273
I mean, you have no idea
what he's doing or who he's doing it with.

1166
01:22:22,356 --> 01:22:25,192
This guilt-free pass thing?
Completely ridiculous.

1167
01:22:25,276 --> 01:22:29,196
The bottom line is this. You two will never be
on the same level again.

1168
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:32,700
You're a virgin and he's not.
It's just not gonna work.

1169
01:22:33,284 --> 01:22:35,369
So, what?
I'm supposed to break up with him?

1170
01:22:35,453 --> 01:22:38,164
No, but you need to get back
on the same level.

1171
01:22:39,623 --> 01:22:42,293
You need to sleep with somebody. Tonight.

1172
01:22:42,376 --> 01:22:44,503
- Brooke.
- Shut up, Natalie.

1173
01:22:44,587 --> 01:22:47,298
It's the only way.
Imagine a month from now,

1174
01:22:47,381 --> 01:22:49,133
you decide to do it with Erik.

1175
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:53,345
All you're going to be thinking is that he's
already had sex with some other girl.

1176
01:22:53,429 --> 01:22:56,140
The relationship will not be
equal unless you do this.

1177
01:22:56,223 --> 01:22:58,726
Oh, look. There's Trent.

1178
01:23:04,523 --> 01:23:05,733
Perfect.

1179
01:23:15,993 --> 01:23:18,787
Hey, cool. A pool table. Do you play?

1180
01:23:20,122 --> 01:23:21,623
Sometimes.

1181
01:23:21,915 --> 01:23:23,792
Well, what do you want to play?

1182
01:23:23,876 --> 01:23:25,210
I don't care.

1183
01:23:25,294 --> 01:23:29,298
Okay. Well, how about nine-ball?
Look, nine-ball.

1184
01:23:29,631 --> 01:23:33,260
It's... It's easy. You just have to get the balls
in order from one through nine.

1185
01:23:33,343 --> 01:23:38,098
I'll show you. I'll break right now.
You'll be good at it.

1186
01:23:40,809 --> 01:23:42,227
- Erik.
- Yeah.

1187
01:23:45,188 --> 01:23:46,565
Come here.

1188
01:24:01,496 --> 01:24:06,209
This is special to you, right?
I mean, this weekend, this night?

1189
01:24:07,294 --> 01:24:08,795
- Erik?
- Yes?

1190
01:24:09,087 --> 01:24:11,506
This is sex, not Shakespeare.

1191
01:24:13,133 --> 01:24:16,344
Are you sure you want to?
Because I doubt I'll be very good.

1192
01:24:16,428 --> 01:24:19,556
Don't worry.
I know how to handle guys like you.

1193
01:24:20,724 --> 01:24:22,017
Guys like me?

1194
01:24:22,100 --> 01:24:23,685
Virgins.

1195
01:24:23,977 --> 01:24:26,104
I can take care of virgins.

1196
01:24:27,522 --> 01:24:30,025
You mean, I'm not your first virgin?

1197
01:24:30,525 --> 01:24:32,736
I have a bit of a confession.

1198
01:24:33,820 --> 01:24:36,698
Some girls like blonds, some like muscles.

1199
01:24:38,032 --> 01:24:39,576
I like virgins.

1200
01:24:41,870 --> 01:24:44,330
Are you ready for a special night?

1201
01:25:00,763 --> 01:25:04,559
Hey there, beautiful.
Didn't expect to see you here tonight.

1202
01:25:04,976 --> 01:25:07,687
I came to apologize.
I heard about what happened,

1203
01:25:07,770 --> 01:25:11,357
and I wanted to let you know
that I didn't know anything about it.

1204
01:25:11,441 --> 01:25:13,776
You're not just here to set me up?

1205
01:25:13,860 --> 01:25:17,363
I would never want
to let anything happen to that gorgeous face.

1206
01:25:19,740 --> 01:25:23,411
You sure you're supposed
to be dancing on enemy territory like this?

1207
01:25:23,494 --> 01:25:27,164
I dance where I want, with who I want.

1208
01:25:28,875 --> 01:25:30,543
I like your style.

1209
01:25:32,670 --> 01:25:34,130
And your ass.

1210
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:49,770
You know, I don't usually go for

1211
01:25:49,854 --> 01:25:53,023
suburban, jock, Abercrombie clones,

1212
01:25:53,149 --> 01:25:55,818
- but there is something about you.
- Yeah?

1213
01:25:55,901 --> 01:25:59,697
Well, I tend to have
that effect on pacifist, vegan bisexuals.

1214
01:26:10,291 --> 01:26:12,793
This guy's got good taste.

1215
01:26:13,168 --> 01:26:16,297
You sure you're up for this
after that little incident downstairs?

1216
01:26:16,380 --> 01:26:21,218
They don't call me "Everhard" because
I've only got one bullet in the chamber.

1217
01:26:21,301 --> 01:26:23,137
But just to be sure...

1218
01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:26,014
Should you be taking more of that?

1219
01:26:26,140 --> 01:26:29,726
More? I didn't take it the first time.

1220
01:26:31,770 --> 01:26:33,897
- You mean...
- That's right, baby.

1221
01:26:33,981 --> 01:26:36,567
We're gonna have a good time tonight.

1222
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:43,282
Now get your worthless ass
on the bed, you peasant.

1223
01:26:43,991 --> 01:26:45,367
Excuse me?

1224
01:26:45,450 --> 01:26:47,452
I said, get on the bed

1225
01:26:47,536 --> 01:26:49,496
you worthless peasant!

1226
01:26:50,455 --> 01:26:53,458
What is your problem?
Whoa, what's that? What...

1227
01:26:53,542 --> 01:26:56,461
- Oh, God!
- I said, get on the bed,

1228
01:26:57,212 --> 01:26:59,297
and I meant it.

1229
01:27:00,882 --> 01:27:04,344
Oh, yeah, baby. I get it.

1230
01:27:05,429 --> 01:27:07,055
And I'm into it.

1231
01:27:07,931 --> 01:27:09,141
Shut up!

1232
01:27:12,394 --> 01:27:14,896
All right! All right! All right!

1233
01:27:32,872 --> 01:27:34,124
Brandy.

1234
01:27:35,417 --> 01:27:39,212
Look, I can't do this. I'm really sorry, okay?

1235
01:27:39,629 --> 01:27:41,673
I mean, you're really gorgeous
and really cool,

1236
01:27:41,756 --> 01:27:44,092
and I'm sure that every single
guy on this planet

1237
01:27:44,175 --> 01:27:47,095
would love to sleep with you, including me.

1238
01:27:47,428 --> 01:27:49,097
But I just can't.

1239
01:27:51,307 --> 01:27:52,725
I'm in love.

1240
01:27:56,229 --> 01:27:58,982
I hope this girl knows how lucky she is.

1241
01:27:59,065 --> 01:28:00,525
I seriously doubt that.

1242
01:28:11,828 --> 01:28:14,956
Got to say it again. It's a very nice surprise.

1243
01:28:15,957 --> 01:28:17,542
What can I say? I'm full of them.

1244
01:28:17,625 --> 01:28:18,960
So, what about Erik?

1245
01:28:19,961 --> 01:28:22,422
We're on a weekend guilt-free pass.

1246
01:28:22,964 --> 01:28:25,508
We can do anything we want.

1247
01:28:25,883 --> 01:28:27,593
Anything?

1248
01:28:27,885 --> 01:28:28,928
Anything.

1249
01:28:29,011 --> 01:28:30,429
I like the sound of that.

1250
01:28:47,279 --> 01:28:48,531
Is this your room?

1251
01:28:48,614 --> 01:28:51,242
Why, yes, it is, my diminutive goddess.

1252
01:28:52,743 --> 01:28:56,497
Good, because we are going to need

1253
01:28:56,580 --> 01:28:58,374
a little bit of privacy.

1254
01:29:09,385 --> 01:29:12,596
That's it, you pathetic slave. Keep doing that.

1255
01:29:13,514 --> 01:29:15,975
Don't you think this is
getting a little out of hand?

1256
01:29:16,058 --> 01:29:19,061
Oh, you haven't even seen
"out of hand" yet.

1257
01:29:19,144 --> 01:29:20,854
I didn't mean we had to stop.

1258
01:29:20,938 --> 01:29:24,566
Oh, we're not stopping.
We're just getting started.

1259
01:29:25,693 --> 01:29:27,528
You ready to get kinky?

1260
01:29:27,611 --> 01:29:29,571
Whoa, this isn't kinky yet?

1261
01:29:30,447 --> 01:29:31,990
Not even close.

1262
01:29:36,203 --> 01:29:37,955
What is that noise?

1263
01:29:45,420 --> 01:29:46,922
What the hell?

1264
01:29:53,011 --> 01:29:55,013
You got to be kidding me.

1265
01:30:24,459 --> 01:30:26,962
So, you wanna go upstairs?

1266
01:30:29,547 --> 01:30:32,092
Yeah, I do.

1267
01:30:47,023 --> 01:30:50,068
Hi, Mr. Sterling. Is Tracy home?

1268
01:30:50,652 --> 01:30:52,779
Hello, Erik. No, she's not.

1269
01:30:52,987 --> 01:30:56,032
She's gone to a party
with Brooke and Natalie.

1270
01:30:56,115 --> 01:30:57,158
Oh.

1271
01:30:58,159 --> 01:31:01,162
Okay. Well, sorry to disturb you, then.

1272
01:31:01,329 --> 01:31:02,580
Have a good night!

1273
01:31:07,252 --> 01:31:09,003
Crazy little fucker.

1274
01:31:14,342 --> 01:31:16,761
We gotta find Tracy. We gotta find Tracy.

1275
01:31:16,844 --> 01:31:19,305
We gotta find Tracy.
Where the fuck is Tracy?

1276
01:31:19,889 --> 01:31:23,142
I don't think sex has to be just one-on-one.

1277
01:31:24,352 --> 01:31:25,853
What the hell?

1278
01:31:27,730 --> 01:31:30,691
Tracy!

1279
01:31:32,318 --> 01:31:33,361
Hey!

1280
01:31:36,989 --> 01:31:38,157
Trace!

1281
01:31:38,491 --> 01:31:39,992
What the hell are you doing here?

1282
01:31:40,076 --> 01:31:41,953
And on a horse!

1283
01:31:42,161 --> 01:31:44,163
Where's Tracy? I have to see her.

1284
01:31:44,247 --> 01:31:46,999
We think it's best if you just leave her alone.

1285
01:31:47,083 --> 01:31:48,542
What? Why?

1286
01:31:48,626 --> 01:31:51,504
Because we know about
your little sorority slut.

1287
01:31:51,587 --> 01:31:55,466
- What are you talking about?
- She saw you kiss that girl on TV.

1288
01:31:55,925 --> 01:31:59,595
Shit. Wait a second. So what?
I was on a guilt-free pass.

1289
01:31:59,678 --> 01:32:02,390
Wake up, Erik. There is no such thing.

1290
01:32:03,432 --> 01:32:04,475
Where is Tracy?

1291
01:32:04,558 --> 01:32:08,646
Oh, we gave Tracy a guilt-free pass,
and she's using it right now.

1292
01:32:12,691 --> 01:32:14,693
Tracy! Trace!

1293
01:32:19,156 --> 01:32:21,992
Hey, hey. Tracy Sterling.
Have you seen her?

1294
01:32:22,076 --> 01:32:25,245
I think she went upstairs with Trent a little...

1295
01:32:25,704 --> 01:32:26,872
Tracy!

1296
01:32:28,666 --> 01:32:29,875
Tracy.

1297
01:32:36,173 --> 01:32:38,967
Trace, can you hear me? Are you in there?

1298
01:32:39,176 --> 01:32:42,012
Trace, if you can hear me, I am sorry.

1299
01:32:42,096 --> 01:32:44,223
I am really sorry about everything, okay?

1300
01:32:44,306 --> 01:32:47,559
I know you gave me this pass,
but I didn't use it.

1301
01:32:47,726 --> 01:32:50,103
I mean I did use it,
but it was only for a few seconds.

1302
01:32:50,187 --> 01:32:53,482
I couldn't go through with it,
so I came here looking for you, okay?

1303
01:32:53,565 --> 01:32:56,818
Look, I don't care about the sex.
I really don't.

1304
01:32:57,527 --> 01:33:00,364
It's not the most important thing. You are.

1305
01:33:00,906 --> 01:33:02,824
Trace, I love you.

1306
01:33:04,368 --> 01:33:05,952
Can you hear me? I love you!

1307
01:33:06,036 --> 01:33:08,789
Do you mind? I'm trying to get laid here.

1308
01:33:11,792 --> 01:33:13,794
You rode
a horse for me?

1309
01:33:23,136 --> 01:33:26,223
When I heard her, I thought...

1310
01:33:27,307 --> 01:33:29,309
I couldn't do it, either.

1311
01:33:32,896 --> 01:33:34,522
I love you, too.

1312
01:34:02,342 --> 01:34:03,676
Should we?

1313
01:35:13,329 --> 01:35:15,372
I'm telling you, man.
I parked the car right here.

1314
01:35:15,456 --> 01:35:19,543
Well, obviously, you didn't,
because then it would be right here.

1315
01:35:20,294 --> 01:35:21,962
Where the hell is Erik?

1316
01:35:22,046 --> 01:35:25,716
Dude, I don't even know
where my underwear is.

1317
01:35:27,468 --> 01:35:28,761
Somebody call a taxi?

1318
01:35:28,844 --> 01:35:30,304
Where the fuck did you go?

1319
01:35:30,387 --> 01:35:31,513
To get some breakfast.

1320
01:35:31,597 --> 01:35:33,682
Oh, sweet. I'm starving.

1321
01:35:40,981 --> 01:35:42,441
I take it you guys had a good night.

1322
01:35:42,524 --> 01:35:44,526
Oh, completely out of hand, bro.

1323
01:35:44,610 --> 01:35:46,278
Where are the girls?

1324
01:35:46,361 --> 01:35:50,324
They all split this morning. Said they had to
drive to State for some big party.

1325
01:35:50,407 --> 01:35:52,034
That must make you feel pretty special.

1326
01:35:52,117 --> 01:35:54,495
"Special"? Who cares about special?

1327
01:35:54,578 --> 01:35:56,705
All I care about is the sex.

1328
01:35:56,788 --> 01:36:00,834
And, baby, I had plenty. Yeah.

1329
01:36:01,293 --> 01:36:04,129
And just how out of hand
was this sex, Cooze?

1330
01:36:04,212 --> 01:36:06,715
I don't wanna talk about it. Ever.

1331
01:36:09,051 --> 01:36:13,764
Speaking of which,
did you seal the deal with that Brandy chick?

1332
01:36:16,266 --> 01:36:17,559
No.

1333
01:36:17,642 --> 01:36:19,603
I told you. Pay up.

1334
01:36:20,353 --> 01:36:23,148
But I did have sex with Tracy last night.

1335
01:36:27,444 --> 01:36:28,653
What are you talking about?

1336
01:36:28,737 --> 01:36:30,197
Tracy.

1337
01:36:30,530 --> 01:36:33,033
I drove home
in the middle of the night, I ran out of gas,

1338
01:36:33,116 --> 01:36:36,328
stole a horse, rode over to Allison's party...

1339
01:36:36,411 --> 01:36:38,580
- We had sex in the guest room.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1340
01:36:38,663 --> 01:36:40,373
- You stole a horse?
- Yup.

1341
01:36:40,457 --> 01:36:42,292
A real horse?
Like the kind you ride and shit?

1342
01:36:42,375 --> 01:36:43,793
Yeah, a real horse.

1343
01:36:43,877 --> 01:36:45,170
That's fucking fantastic.

1344
01:36:45,253 --> 01:36:47,088
I didn't think you had the
balls for something like that.

1345
01:36:47,172 --> 01:36:49,674
- Neither did I.
- Where did you find a horse?

1346
01:36:49,758 --> 01:36:51,926
Are there horses in Great Falls?

1347
01:36:54,095 --> 01:36:55,555
Proud of you,

1348
01:36:56,556 --> 01:36:57,766
Stifler.

1349
01:36:59,309 --> 01:37:02,395
Thanks, man. I appreciate it.
But call me Erik.

1350
01:37:11,237 --> 01:37:14,157
So, how do you feel?
- Best night of my entire life.

1351
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:16,659
See you in a year,
college pussy!

1352
01:37:32,842 --> 01:37:34,594
Mail call, bitches.

1353
01:37:36,179 --> 01:37:37,346
Scooter.

1354
01:37:38,514 --> 01:37:39,724
Scratchy.

1355
01:37:40,808 --> 01:37:42,018
Tripod.

1356
01:37:47,356 --> 01:37:48,441
What the hell?

1357
01:37:48,524 --> 01:37:49,984
What is it, man?

1358
01:37:50,943 --> 01:37:52,403
I don't know.

1359
01:38:04,290 --> 01:38:06,375
<i>Smile for the camera, baby.</i>

1360
01:38:14,759 --> 01:38:17,428
Oh, man. That is fucked up.

1361
01:38:20,347 --> 01:38:21,849
Stifler!
