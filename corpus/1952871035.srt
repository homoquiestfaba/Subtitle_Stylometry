<i># Answer me #</i>

34
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,900
- Wow.
- Sit down.

35
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,500
Thanks.

36
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,800
How was your night?

37
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,000
Good. How was yours?

38
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,100
Good.

39
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,000
This is great.

40
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,300
Your shift's at 8.30?

41
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,900
- You're not eating?
- I already did.

42
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,500
You OK?

43
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,700
Are you going to go with me
to Cindy and Bill's this weekend?

44
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,100
Sure. What time?

45
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,100
For the baby shower?

46
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,900
Right.

47
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,200
I don't want to go.

48
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,800
You don't?

49
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,800
I want Cindy and Bill to come here.

50
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,400
Cindy and Bill are welcome here
whenever they want.

51
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,000
Henry.

52
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,600
Don't you think it's time?

53
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,900
You're talking about kids.

54
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,900
Of course I am.

55
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,500
- OK.
- "OK", you want kids?

56
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,500
I love kids.

57
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:51,500
Henry, do you still love me?

58
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,300
Of course I do.

59
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,800
Cos I know that you used to.

60
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,100
What happened?

61
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,500
Henry Torne.

62
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,500
Eddie Vibes.

63
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,000
So how you been?

64
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,100
I'm OK. What's going on?

65
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,800
Ah, we got a man down here.

66
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,500
I was wondering
if we could come in for a second.

67
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,800
Joe! Joe. Come on.

68
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,200
Oh, oh, oh.

69
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
- You feel really hot.
- I'm sorry.

70
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,100
Come with me.
Just get right to the back.

71
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,500
- Straight back to the kitchen.
- I'm sorry.

72
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,000
- Goddamn sausages at Pinwheels.
- Yeah?

73
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,100
So, er...
we're in a bit of a bind here, Henry.

74
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,200
We got a big play-off game
in the next half-hour

75
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,300
and buddy boy there's
our first baseman.

76
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,200
But as you can see,
he's not exactly game-ready.

77
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,300
So what do you say?

78
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,500
Feel like playing a little ball?

79
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,100
It's November.

80
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,500
Yeah. They keep the field
in pretty good shape.

81
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,700
Oh.

82
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,300
Oh, God. OK. OK.

83
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,400
So what do you say?

84
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,000
Henry?

85
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,600
So where's this game?

86
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:51,200
Near Kaisertown,
about er... 15 minutes away.

87
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,800
Appreciate you driving, Torne.

88
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,300
Sure.

89
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,100
Just pull over here.

90
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,300
Stop and get some beer money
at the ATM.

91
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,500
Good.

92
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,800
So, er... hang tight.
We'll be right back.

93
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,300
Keep the engine running, OK?

94
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,100
- Le petit café, Frank.
- Merci, merci.

95
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,600
- A bientôt, Pierre.
- A demain, Frank.

96
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,300
Hey, you! Freeze!

97
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,500
Freeze!

98
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,000
We know this wasn't your deal, Torne.

99
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,000
These people aren't your friends.
Why stick up for 'em?

100
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,700
You got a wife, you got a job.
Don't you care?

101
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,500
You're looking
at three to seven, Henry.

102
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,600
All you gotta do is say something.

103
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,700
The court sentences Henry Torne
to three years in prison

104
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:55,900
for the crime of
Felony First-Degree Armed Robbery.

105
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,500
Hey. Excuse me.

106
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,400
I'm Max.

107
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,400
- Henry.
- Henry, good.

108
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,100
Um... what are you in for?

109
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,100
- What?
- What are you in for?

110
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,600
Bank robbery.

111
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,500
Nice. Clean, simple. I like it.

112
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,400
- I didn't do it.
- No, of course not.

113
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,900
Mistaken identity.

114
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,600
What are you in for?

115
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,400
Life.

116
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,700
Just...

117
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,200
Put it anywhere. It doesn't matter.

118
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,600
It's not like you got much choice.

119
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,100
Come on, hurry up, it's breakfast.

120
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:10,400
Come on.
Monday is wholewheat bun day.

121
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,700
What are you thinking?

122
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,900
- Nothing.
- You can't be thinking nothing.

123
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:28,400
Let me guess. You're thinking,
"How in hell did I get here?"

124
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,200
How do you think we all got here?

125
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,700
I don't know.

126
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,700
We committed crimes, Henry.

127
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,400
But we committed to the wrong thing.

128
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,200
See, that was a mistake.
We never fulfilled our potential.

129
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,100
See this guy here in the middle?

130
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,200
Don't stare at him.

131
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,900
Name's Hector.
He wanted to be a doctor.

132
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,300
Thanks.
And he could have been a good one.

133
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,100
Well, good or bad, I don't know.

134
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:56,300
But he chose not to fulfil
his potential. Now look at him.

135
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,800
So I'm talking about bad choices.

136
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,800
I recommend these potatoes.
They're really terrific.

137
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:06,100
Give him a little extra,
please, Charlie. Thank you.

138
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:11,300
See, the real crime
is not committing to your dream.

139
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,800
What is yours, anyway?

140
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,000
- My what?
- Your dream.

141
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,400
Not sure I ever had one.

142
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,000
Never had a dream?
I mean, what kinda life's that?

143
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,500
I don't know. A pretty good one.

144
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,200
Hm.

145
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:31,300
I don't er... mean any offence, Henry,
but you're in jail.

146
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,500
Are you going to eat
the rest of this wholewheat?

147
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,500
- No.
- Thanks.

148
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,800
- Hi.
- Hi.

149
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,300
How are you?

150
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,400
I'm OK.

151
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,300
How about you?

152
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,200
I'm good.

153
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,400
You look beautiful.

154
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,600
Henry...

155
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,500
...there's something
I have to talk to you about.

156
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,200
OK.

157
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,100
I fell in love.

158
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,500
Oh.

159
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,400
I just... I mean, it just happened.

160
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,500
I'm really sorry.

161
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,100
- It's all right.
- You're not mad?

162
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,300
No.

163
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,700
I want you to be happy.

164
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,100
Hey, Max, when's your next review?

165
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,800
November.

166
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,300
Show us
what you did last time for the board.

167
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,900
I'm working. Stop.

168
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,500
- What? One time.
- Come on, show us.

169
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,400
- Show us!
- Leave me alone, OK?

170
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,800
- Just once, come on.
- Come on!

171
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,200
Pain in the ass. All right.

172
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,500
So last time, um... I'm sitting there,

173
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,300
and um... the Head of the Board
comes and says,

174
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:18,900
"OK, Max, what are you going to do
for us this time if we let you out?"

175
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,400
I get the old twitch working,

176
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,100
and I go...

177
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,200
"Well, um...

178
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,900
"I'm going to break into your house

179
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:33,200
"and then I'll kill your dog
and set the house on fire.

180
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,300
"Then I'll dance through your garden

181
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:39,400

00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:45,500
"and I'll tear the tongue

184
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,600

185
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,700

00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,600
"Boom.

189
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,700
"Boom! You guys wanna see this?

190
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,800
"I can't wait. Boom."

191
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,500
What? What?

192
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,900
You scared the shit out of me,
I tell you.

193
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,700
Well, believe me,
I ain't going anywhere, thank God.

194
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,700
When's your review coming up?

195
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,400
- Next month.
- You gonna twitch like your cellie?

196
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,900
- Nope.
- You don't like it around here?

197
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Everyone knows Henry's innocent!

198
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,900
Board doesn't like you denying it.

199
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,500
- I didn't do the crime.
- But you got the time.

200
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,300
So you might as well have done it.

201
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,000
I kinda like that.
That's funny, know what I mean?

202
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,200
If you did the time, you might as
well have done the crime. It's cute.

203
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,500
You're cute too, kid.
Get up. You're finished.

204
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,300
- Get out of here.
- Thanks, Max.

205
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:00,100
You never did tell me
what your dream was, Max.

206
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,200
What?

207
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,800
You never told me your dream.

208
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,900
- I'm living it.
- Really?

209
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,700
Well, yeah.
I mean, it's easy, living in here.

210
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,400
I got nothing to prove,

211
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,700
all you really gotta do is show up

212
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,200
and they even do that for you.

213
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:20,000
So, er... it's nice. It's good, yeah.

214
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,900
This place is horrible, Max.

215
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:25,900
Well, that makes me wonder
why er... Why didn't you ever talk?

216
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,000
- When?
- Back then. When you had the chance.

217
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,100
I mean, why?

218
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,900
I felt maybe this was my way out.

219
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,900
Oh. Was it?

220
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,400
Yeah.

221
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,100
- Bullshit.
- What do you mean?

222
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,800
I mean bullshit. Nothing's changed.

223
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,800
I mean, whether you're
out there or you're here...

224
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,100
...the truth is, Henry,
you're still the same guy.

225
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,300
Sorry.

226
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,400
Have you got everything, kid?

227
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:22,200
Hey, Max, maybe you should
think about getting out of here.

228
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:29,200
Listen. The only thing I ever missed
in 23 years is maybe a hot bath.

229
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:33,400
To tell the truth, I don't think
that's worth walking out of here for.

230
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Torne, let's go.

231
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,700
I hope I never see you again.

Henry.

249
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,200
Hey.

250
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,200
Hey, Debbie, Henry's here.

251
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:13,100
- Come in. Make yourself at home.
- Thanks.

252
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,900
Don't mind me.
I'm just setting up for my meeting.

253
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,500
Hey, you want a beer?

254
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,800
- Sure.
- Honey, mind getting Henry a beer?

255
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,700
Hi.

256
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,500
Hi.

257
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,600
I know.

258
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,300
That's everything you wanted.

259
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,800
Thanks.

260
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,100
- Are you happy?
- I am.

261
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,700
I'm glad.

262
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,500
What are you gonna do now?

263
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,300
Honey, they're starting to arrive.

264
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:21,300
Maybe you'd be interested, Henry.
You could be a Jin Chi distributor.

265
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,100
It's Korean kitchenware,
the future of food storage.

266
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,000
Plus if you recruit distributors
you get paid even more.

267
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:35,400
- You mean like a pyramid scheme?
- No. Not... No. Not...

268
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,600
It's a multi-layered
marketing paradidgem.

269
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,900
Anyway, give it some thought.

270
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,900
Listen, Henry, I just wanted
to say thank you, you know.

271
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,700
For what?

272
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,000
For not giving up my name.

273
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,500
- I don't know your name.
- Sure you do. It's Joe.

274
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,300
You're welcome, Joe.

275
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,800
I'll see you, Deb.

276
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,600

277
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,100

278
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:35,400

281
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,000

00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:50,000
<i>Tak e a chance on life.</i>
<i>Tak e a chance on Buffalotto.</i>

283
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:26,300
What are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing?

284
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,900
Are you OK?

285
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,500
Stan, I... I gotta call you back.
I just ran someone over. OK.

286
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:36,300
You idiot! You weren't even
looking where you were going.

287
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,100
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

288
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,300
- Is he OK? Is he all right?
- I think so.

289
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,200
Don't get up. I'll call an ambulance.

290
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,500
- No, don't. I'm OK.
- Hey, it's you.

291
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,000
Yeah, me.

292
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,300
You know what,
he walked out into the street.

293
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,100
I saw it all. You were on your phone.

294
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,300
- You weren't even paying attention.
- I was.

295
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,200
- I know how to drive.
- You know what?

296
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,400
Just park. I'll take him to the café.

297
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,600
Where are you going?
Stay on the ground.

298
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,900
There we go. There we go.

299
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,300
So they let you out, huh?

300
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,100
Yeah.

301
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,800
Un verre d'eau, Pierre.

302
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,600
Thanks.

303
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,900
Did you call an ambulance?
It's OK. I really am fine.

304
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,300
Fine for a guy who just got run over.

305
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,100
Lucky, I guess.

306
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,400
I think someone should look at you.

307
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:40,100
Hello. Guy.
Do you wanna see someone?

308
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,500
- You look familiar.
- What?

309
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,100
Oh. Oh.

310
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,100
- That.
- What?

311
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,500
Take a chance on life.
Take a chance on Buffalotto.

312
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,500
- Oh. That's you.
- Unfortunately, yeah.

313
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,600
Er... I mean, look,
you seem to be OK, right?

314
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,100
Yeah, I'm OK.

315
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,300
Great. So I can go now, right?

316
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,900
- Sure.
- OK, then.

317
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,800
Goodbye.

318
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,500
And, you know, be more careful.

319
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,600
I told you I never wanted
to see that face again.

320
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,900
So?

321
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,700
I figured it out.

322
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,800
- Figured what out?
- My dream.

323
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,800
Oh, that's good. So what is it?

324
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,600
The bank.

325
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,100
- The bank is your dream?
- Yeah.

326
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:59,500
- Um... what bank?
- The one I didn't rob.

327
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,100
- That's your dream?
- Yeah.

328
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,600
What kind of
cockamamie dream is that?

329
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:08,000
I did the time,
I may as well have done the crime.

330
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,500
Yeah. Time, crime, right.

331
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,100
- So what do you say?
- About what?

332
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,700
- Will you help me?
- Help you what?

333
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:25,300
You came to jail to ask me
to help you rob a bank?

334
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,900
Yeah.

335
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,300
I missed you, Henry.

336
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,600
You've got your review coming up.

337
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,200
- Yeah, so?
- So you can get out of here.

338
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,200
- It's not that simple.
- Yes, it is.

339
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,900
- It's not.
- It is.

340
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,900
No, it is not.
This is my home, buddy.

341
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,900
This is not a home, Max.
It's a prison.

342
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,900
Call it what you like. I'm happy here.

343
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,400
Max.

344
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,900
You can't die in this place.

345
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,000
I can die
pretty much wherever I want.

346
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,800
I'm asking for your help.

347
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,600
I need your help.

348
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,800
- I got cards, kid.
- Max.

349
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,900
Come on. Look, I've thought about...

350
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,500
<i># I got a thing on my mind</i>

351
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,200
<i># Sure enough gonna find it</i>

352
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,700
<i># I got a thing on my mind</i>

353
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,600
<i># Sure enough gonna find it</i>

354
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,300
<i># Don't let nobody tell me</i>

355
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,000
<i># My thing, it won't come true</i>

356
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,900
<i># Cos I ain't lying down</i>

357
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,800
<i># Till I get my dues</i>

358
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,200
<i># I got a thing on my mind</i>

359
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,900
<i># I'm sure enough gonna find it... #</i>

360
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,900
God knows, I love my country.
I love it deeply.

361
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:04,400
I couldn't see out of the train window,
I was crying so much.

362
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:08,600
But I must drink my coffee.

363
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,400
Firs, coffee. Firs?

364
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,000
Where's Firs?

365
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,100
I'm sorry, Firs is sick today.

366
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,800
- What?
- He's... He's sick.

367
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,100
He's sick. You know it. Continue.

368
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,500
Fine, I'll pretend Firs is here.

369
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,500
Thank you, Firs, you dear old man.

370
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,300
I'm so glad to find you still alive.

371
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,300
I said I'm so glad
to find you still alive.

372
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,000
He's a little deaf.

373
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,500
Your brother Leonid Andreyevich

374
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:40,100
says that I'm an upstart,
a money-grubber.

375
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:44,400
He can say whatever he likes.
I don't care. A bit.

376
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:50,100
I just want you to believe in me.
Like in the old days.

377
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:54,200
I just want your wonderful tender
eyes to look on me like they used to.

378
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:58,800
No, no, no, no, no.
Stop, stop. It just is bloody.

379
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:01,300
No! Simone.

380
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:05,800
It's too small. It's too safe.

381
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:09,400
- Stop showing me that safe face.
- Good, I won't.

382
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,300
No, I'm not talking about you.
You're doing the best you can.

383
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,000
I'm talking to you.

384
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,000
- What are you doing?
- Me?

385
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,500
Yes.

386
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,800
Well, I... I'm listening.

387
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:24,900
Listening?
Well, it looks like you're...

388
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,900
...hearing, and to hear is to be weak.

389
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,800
To listen is to be strong.

390
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,900
Why? Because to listen is an action.

391
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,700
No. What... What is that?

392
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,600
It's an action. I'm listening.

393
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:48,200
I mean, is that what you want?
Is that what you mean?

394
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,200
- No, Djula.
- Mm-hm. OK.

395
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,300
Then what do you want?

396
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,700
You're performing, you're performing.

397
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:00,100
Nothing comes out.
You're just performing. Performing.

398
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,700
Well, that's what I do, Darek.

399
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,200
I'm an actress.

400
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:06,200
You can call yourself
whatever you want,

401
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,900
but so far
you haven't shown me anything real.

402
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,400
You see, here on stage,

403
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:16,100
every moment, every word,
every breath should be a risk.

404
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:20,300
Where is your risk, Djula?

405
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,100
I don't know, Darek. In your ass?

406
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:27,100
Good! Finally she's listening! Hah!

407
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,100
From the top, everybody.

408
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,500
I'm going to grab some coffee.

409
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,700
Well, you do that, Djula.
Go and grab a coffee.

410
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:38,900
Let's all have coffee and think about
what we're willing to risk in life.

411
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,100
What are you doing here?
You here to sue me?

412
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,200
- No.
- Good.

413
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,100
20 minutes. I don't care.

414
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,500
- Is it always like that?
- What?

415
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,300
- That.
- In rehearsal?

416
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,600
- Yeah.
- It's a process.

417
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,900
Looks complicated.

418
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,500
Yeah, it is.

419
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,400
- Madame Julie.
- Coffee, Pierre.

420
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,100
You want one?

421
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,900
- Sure.
- Deux.

422
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,600
- Deux cafés.
- Oui.

423
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,300
Thanks.

424
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,500
You looked like you were listening.

425
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:28,800
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

426
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,300
Really?

427
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,000
In a way.

428
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,300
Yeah. Yeah, I wasn't.

429
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,500
I wasn't. I was playing it safe.

430
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,800
You know, "The Cherry Orchard"
was Chekhov's last play.

431
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,100
He was dying when he wrote it.

432
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,900
It's kind of perfect.

433
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:54,100
- Why?
- Because it's my last play, too.

434
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,100
Here in Buffalo.

435
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:59,100
I'm leaving. Right after this.

436
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,500
So who are you?

437
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,400
You mean my name?

438
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,600
OK.

439
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,100
I'm Henry.

440
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:18,700
Well, I wanna thank you
for not suing me, Henry.

441
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,200
Au revoir, Madame Julie.

442
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,700
Ciao, ciao.

443
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,700
Mr Saltzman, please tell the Board

444
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,900
why you believe
we should grant you a parole.

445
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,700
Come on, Mr Saltzman.

446
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,700
What have you got for us this time?

447
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,800
Mr Saltzman?

448
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,700
Come on, Max.

449
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,000
See you, George.

450
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,000
- I knew you could do it.
- Yeah.

451
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,500
Um...

452
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,300
...where is your car?

453
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,100
I don't have a car.

454
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,700
You don't have a car?

455
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,300
I sold it.

456
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,100
Well, what is the matter with you?

457
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,500
You come to pick me up
and you don't have a car.

458
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,600
That is not the way
you pick up a person!

459
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:34,100
Yes, it is. I'm here.
I'm picking you up.

460
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,000
Look, I really don't know about this.

461
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,400
I think I'm making
a pretty big mistake.

462
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:43,000
Look, Max,
the bus station's just a short walk.

463
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,500
Bus station?

464
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,500
Don't worry, Max.

465
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,200
Carl? Hey, Dave!

466
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,700
Let me in, will you? Open up!

467
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,800
Max, it's gonna be OK.

468
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,500
Are you kidding me?
This is your plan?

469
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,100
An old cartoon in a pissoir?

470
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,900
- It's a start.
- No, this is 80 years ago.

471
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:14,100
Wait. I tell you what we do.
We do it the old-fashioned way.

472
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,900
- We go in with guns.
- No guns.

473
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:18,000
- Why?
- Someone could get hurt.

474
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,200
That's very sweet of you, Henry.

475
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,400
Maybe the tunnel's still there, Max.

476
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,100
Yes, I'm sure it is, right!

477
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,300
- Maybe it is.
- Maybe it is.

478
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,000
But maybe it's not.
I tell you what we do.

479
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:35,800
First we go to this bank of yours
and see if that's there.

480
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,300
It is.

481
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:40,500
I'm sure it is. But maybe it's not.

482
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:53,700
Now, which kind of account
would you like to open?

483
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,500
Well, which kind have you got?

484
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,000
Er... savings, interest-only,
commercial...

485
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,700
Excuse me for interrupting.

486
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:03,200
I was just thinking,
it's such a small world.

487
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:08,600
My uncle... My uncle, he put all his
money in your vault when I was a kid.

488
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,000
I mean, after we came from Europe.

489
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,500
Before the War.

490
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,500
The brownshirts and...

491
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,700
Well, what was my point, anyway?

492
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,900
I... Yes, and I remember him,
my uncle, telling me

493
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,600
that your vault
would probably be here for 300 years.

494
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,300
- Well, we hope he's right.
- The man was never wrong.

495
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:33,600
Er...
how long has that vault been here?

496
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,900
Er... since 1891.

497
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:40,500
Wow. And I'm just assuming
it's in the same spot.

498
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,500
Oh, yeah, yeah. Exact same spot.

499
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,900
History, son. It's all about history.

500
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,400
As I was saying,
we have savings, interest-only...

501
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:51,400
Again, pardon me,
but you'll have to just give us

502
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,700
a little time to decide
which of those we prefer.

503
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:57,100
But I want to thank you so very much.

504
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:00,600
- Oh, well, no, thank you.
- No, thank you for being so kind.

505
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,300
OK, we'll get in touch with you.

506
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,800
Have a nice day, gentlemen.

507
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:20,500
The vault is somewhere in here.

508
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,100
The tunnel runs somewhere under here

509
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:26,000
and ends up somewhere in there.

510
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,400
It's virtually robbing itself,
isn't it?

511
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,900
Goddamn Chekhov shit!

512
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,500
Jesus. Henry?

513
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,400
Hi.

514
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,300
Julie, Max. Max, Julie.

515
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,000
How do you do?

516
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,300
- What are you doing here?
- Er...

517
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:50,000
I was er... I was just showing Henry
the place where I used to perform.

518
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,800
Oh. What?

519
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,900
- That's lunch, Julie.
- Oh. Thank God.

520
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,100
Yes,
Chekhov can be extremely difficult.

521
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,300
It sometimes takes
a cast-iron stomach.

522
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:02,000
- Why, you know Chekhov?
- Of course.

523
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:05,800
Next to Gorbachev,
he's my favourite Russian.

524
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:10,400
Excuse me, would you mind terribly
if I er... took a look inside?

525
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,300
It's been maybe 30 years
since I've been in there.

526
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,900
- Really?
- Yes.

527
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,300
Well, er... yeah, sure.

528
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,100
Very kind of you.

529
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,000
How are you doing?

530
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,800
Great! I'm in hell.

531
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,800
Home again.

532
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,800
- What shows did you do?
- Ma'am?

533
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,500
What productions were you in?

534
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,600
Ah.

535
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,700
Er... some of the greats.

536
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,900
Er... Shakespeare, of course.

537
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,900
Er... Ibsen, er... Yeats, Williams.

538
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,600
Yeats. Yeats?
What play did Yeats write?

539
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,900
No, it was about Yeats,
when he was a young man.

540
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,500
Julie. Excuse me. Julie,
Mary wants to fit your wig at four

541
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,500
and Darek says to stay hungry.

542
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,400
- Fuck him.
- Got it.

543
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,800
Um...
can I be a bit of a nuisance, please?

544
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,900
I'd very much appreciate
a small tour around the old place,

545
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,300
if you wouldn't mind.

546
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,500
He used to perform here.

547
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:22,800
- I suppose it's OK. We're on a break.
- Oh, thank you.

548
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,700
- Henry?
- Sure. Go ahead.

549
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,600
Julie, thanks so much.

550
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,000
Is that your dad?

551
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:37,200
- No, he's a friend.
- Really? Cos he seems like your dad.

552
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,300
It's peaceful out here.

553
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,700
Ah, the inner sanctum.
Like it was yesterday.

554
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,200
Down here.

555
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,300
People often make the mistake
of going down

556
00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:01,900
but in Chekhov,
you must always, always go up.

557
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,500
- Bring back some memories?
- Oh, indeed.

558
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,800
Let me tell you something.

559
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:14,700
Did you know that there used to be
a speakeasy here during Prohibition?

560
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,700
And they hid the booze in the bank.

561
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,200
Exactly.

562
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,800
Did you know there was a tunnel?
There was a tunnel.

563
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:27,300
I know that. I know that.
As a matter of fact, that tunnel...

564
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,100
That tunnel was um...

565
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,200
I know where it is.

566
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,900
- I'll show it to you.
- Really?

567
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,800
- Mm-hm.
- Um...

568
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,700
You did some acting yourself,
didn't you?

569
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,700
I could tell.

570
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,100
"The Cherry Orchard".

571
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,400
So what's it about?

572
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:50,600
A woman returns to her family estate
in the Russian countryside

573
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:56,100
and she realises that she has
to sell her beloved cherry orchard,

574
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,900
which is
the magical place of her youth.

575
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,600
It's the only place
she's ever felt safe.

576
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,500
And it's about um...

577
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,900
being forced to let go of the past

578
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:14,700
and create a new life
in order to survive.

579
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,500
We're going to have to be quick

580
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,900
because Arnold hates
people in his dressing room.

581
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,700
- Arnold?
- Oh, Lopakhin.

582
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,200
Of course.

583
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,900
Hello?

584
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,900
And I think it was right here.

585
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,200
Yeah.

586
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,000
Huh. Amazing.

587
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,900
Oh, boy. Lots of whisky.

588
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,700
Filled with ladies and gentlemen.

589
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,600
The good old days. Can you imagine?

590
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:52,100
I think they sealed it up in 1931

591
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,100
when they built the theatre.

592
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,700
Yeah, times have changed.

593
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:01,200
Well, all good things
must come to an end, unfortunately.

594
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,200
So what's your story, Henry?

595
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,900
- My story?
- Like, what do you do?

596
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,600
I'm figuring that out.

597
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:11,000
Does that mean you don't have a job?

598
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,400
I er...

599
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,000
...just got out of prison.

600
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,500
- Prison?
- It sounds worse than it is.

601
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:21,500
Really? Cos prison sounds bad.

602
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:24,800
Why were you there?
Are you a murderer or something?

603
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,800
No. Do I look like one?

604
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,400
- No.
- What do I look like?

605
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:34,100
Oh, this place is
just full of treasures.

606
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,800
Thank you so much.
It was great. Thank you.

607
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,100
- And thank you, Simon.
- My pleasure.

608
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:42,500
- And I'll see you tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

609
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,600
Max has offered
to volunteer at the theatre.

610
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,300
Oh.

611
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,800
Work.

612
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:51,900
Work. It's time to work,
you lazy Americans.

613
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,900
Even you, Djula. Top of act two.

614
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,700
What are you doing afterwards?

615
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,300
- Why?
- You like Chinese?

616
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,300
- Yeah.
- Jinlan?

617
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,600
- Yeah, it's OK.
- Eight o'clock?

618
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,700
Sure.

619
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,800
- Great.
- Great.

620
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,900
Djula, can we please start?

621
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,900
Stay out of prison.

622
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,400
- Djula, please.
- Yes, yes!

623
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,200
- Can we start?
- I'm here!

624
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,600
Good. You're coming in stage right.

625
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,700
I can see it all, Henry.

626
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,300
The bank,

627
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,000
the vault, the theatre, the tunnel.

628
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:40,600
See,
we got all the pieces of the puzzle

629
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,500
sitting right there on the table.

630
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:45,900
Now all we gotta do
is put 'em in the right order.

631
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:49,000
The only thing is the dirt.

632
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,600
Where does the dirt
from the tunnel go?

633
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,300
What about the vault?

634
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,600
- I'm thinking dirt right now, Henry.
- OK.

635
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,800
How do I look?

636
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:08,700
- Huh?
- How do I look?

637
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,800
You look like Henry.

638
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,100
You gonna be all right?

639
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,500
Yeah, we had a great day, kid.
Have yourself a nice dinner.

640
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,800
Julie.

641
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,800
Sorry I'm late.

642
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,700
That guy's a total dick.

643
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,100
Hi, Henry.

644
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:01,900
Hi. So how was the rehearsal?

645
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,400
I feel like duck.

646
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:13,000
Yeah, I think I'm good.
The reviews are mostly good.

647
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:18,800
But the problem is I don't just
wanna be good. I wanna be great.

648
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,500
And I don't just
wanna be great in Buffalo.

649
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,700
Where, then?

650
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,100
Don't laugh.

651
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:31,300
Hollywood.

652
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,300
I guess that's where people go.

653
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:41,200
Yeah.

654
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:46,200
You know, I just don't want my legacy
to be a Buffalotto commercial.

655
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,900
You know what? It's not going to be.

656
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:50,400
Because the moment
this thing is done, I'm out of here.

657
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:54,500
I'm just... I've gotta get out
before it's too late.

658
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:58,000
Sounds like a plan.

659
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,700
Yeah.

660
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:09,200
I hate fortune cookies.

661
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,400
I like 'em.

662
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:25,500
Are we going anywhere in particular?

663
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,200
Mm-hm.

664
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:32,200
You want some?

665
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,300
- No.
- No?

666
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,300
Come on, take a chance.
Take a chance on life.

667
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:57,500
There's a whole bunch of bodies
down there just churning around,

668
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:01,000
caught in the current.

669
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:19,500
So what did you do before jail,
Henry?

670
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:21,600
I worked at a tollbooth.

671
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:23,800
- Yeah? Which one?
- Eden.

672
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,300
- No!
- Yes.

673
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:28,100
Yay! I had family on the other side.

674
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:32,000
We must have seen
each other 100 times.

675
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:33,800
So, er... wow.

676
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:36,800
You were one of those guys
in the tollbooth with the er...

677
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,600
those weird... those rubber gloves.

678
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,200
Yeah.

679
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:44,700
What's so funny?

680
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:46,500
It's just...

681
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:49,100
You were watching everyone
go someplace

682
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:52,300
and you were going nowhere.

683
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,600
- That's funny?
- Yeah.

684
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:56,400
It's funny-sad.

685
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:01,400
So what did you go to jail for,
Henry?

686
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:04,700
- Trying to rob Buffalo Savings Bank.
- What?

687
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:09,900
I thought I was on my way
to a softball game but I... wasn't.

688
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,900
- But now I'm gonna rob it for real.
- What?

689
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:15,100
I'm going to rob it for real.

690
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:18,100
You're going to rob the bank
that you went to jail for robbing?

691
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,100
Yeah.

692
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:22,900
- There's a tunnel.
- What tunnel?

693
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,900
It runs from the bank to the theatre.

694
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:27,400
- My theatre?
- Yeah.

695
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,000
Fucking hilarious, Henry.

696
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,200
You know what?

697
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:39,500
- What?
- I'm hungry.

698
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:41,500
- For what?
- Ice cream.

699
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:43,300
Ice cream.

700
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:47,700
Let's get some ice cream.

701
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:03,800
I can't believe I'm sitting here.

702
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,300
Neither can I.

703
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:09,900
I want to dance and clap my hands.
I think I must be dreaming.

704
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:17,700
You know,
"God knows, I love my country.

705
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,100
"I love it deeply.

706
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:22,000
"I couldn't see out of the train window,
I was crying so much."

707
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:25,500
Page 21.

708
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:34,200
Could you read Lopakhin?

709
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:35,800
Sure.

710
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:44,500
"I have to go to Kharkov on the
five o'clock train. Such a bother.

711
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:46,300
"I wanted to stay and talk to you.

712
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:49,200
"You're as wonderful as ever."

713
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,100
Read the next line.

714
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,500
"Even more beautiful,

715
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:57,400
"and dressed like a Parisian...
You could blow me down."

716
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:01,100
Um...

717
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:03,100
could you say it like you feel it?

718
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:04,600
Like it's real.

719
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,800
Just say it to me.

720
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:09,500
OK.

721
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,300
"Even more beautiful.

722
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,500
"And dressed like a Parisian...

723
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:19,300
"You could blow me down."

724
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:26,500
You're good. That's really good.

725
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:31,500
You know what, I want you to keep
reading, but get up and walk around.

726
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,700
- "Your brother Leonard..."
- Leonid.

727
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:40,200
- Leonid.
- Leonid.

728
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,800
"Your brother Leonid says
I'm an upstart. A money-grubber."

729
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,200
Yes, you are, Henry.
You're a bank robber.

730
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:50,700
"He can say whatever he likes.
I don't care a bit.

731
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:53,500
"I just want you to believe in me
like in the old days."

732
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,200
Again.

733
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:57,700
"I just want you...

734
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:00,800
"I just want you to believe in me
like in the old days.

735
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,900
"I just want
your wonderful, tender eyes

736
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:04,700
"to look at me like they did then."

737
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,700
Say it without the book now.

738
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:18,700
"I just want
your wonderful, tender eyes

739
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,500
"to look at me

740
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:23,300
"like they did then."

741
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:28,400
Oh, I'm so glad I ran you over.

742
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,400
Me too.

743
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:01,700
Good morning.

744
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,700
Good morning.

745
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:27,300
Good morning.

746
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,800
- Henry!
- Morning, Max.

747
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,900
Hey, listen. I figured it out.

748
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,700
The dirt from the tunnel
goes on the roof.

749
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:50,700
Ah, company.

750
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:54,700
- Good morning, Max.
- I'm sorry about the um...

751
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,400
- It's all right. She knows.
- She does?

752
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:01,600
I didn't know the dirt
from the tunnel goes on the roof.

753
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,500
Don't worry.
I'm not going to tell anyone.

754
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,800
Could I just have a second with you?

755
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:11,300
Pardon us, will you?

756
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:18,100
- What do you mean, you told her?
- I told her.

757
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:20,100
- You told her everything?
- Yeah.

758
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:23,500
Henry, it's a crime.
A crime's supposed to be secret.

759
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:27,000
- It's OK, Max.
- No, it is not. It's not kosher.

760
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:30,900
How do you like your bacon?

761
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:35,400
Crispy.

762
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:42,700
- What were you in prison for, Max?
- I was a confidence man.

763
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,400
You mean a con man?

764
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:47,000
I um... I don't like that word.

765
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,600
Er, "confidence"
is a little more elegant.

766
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:54,400
"Confidence" comes from the Greek
"fides", meaning faith and belief.

767
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:56,400
Greek?

768
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,300
I thought it was Latin.

769
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:01,500
Well, yes, it is... it is now.

770
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:09,500
So, essentially, you make people
feel good and then you rip 'em off?

771
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:13,500
Yes. But I was always a little better
at the feeling good part

772
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:16,500
than I was with the ripping off part,
hence jail.

773
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:22,100
Aren't you worried
about getting caught?

774
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:24,900
Well, it's kind of
a win-win situation for me.

775
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:26,500
Why?

776
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:28,700
I like jail.

777
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,700
What about you, Henry?

778
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:33,200
You like jail?

779
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:34,900
No.

780
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:36,800
I like it out here.

781
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:38,800
So why would you take the risk?

782
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:42,100
Or is it the money?

783
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:44,400
Well, it must be the money.

784
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,400
Boy, you are a criminal.

785
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:50,600
You're a greedy little criminal.

786
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:54,000
Your brother Leonid says
I'm an upstart. A money-grubber.

787
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:56,600
But I don't care a bit.

788
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:59,300
I just want you to believe in me
like in the old days.

789
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:02,200
Cute! You remember. Good!

790
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:09,000
Excuse me.

791
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,600
- Excuse me.
- What?

792
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,100
- Um... what exactly was that?
- It was Chekhov.

793
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:15,700
Chekhov?

794
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:18,800
- Oh, of course. Yeah.
- We read it last night.

795
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,700
Yeah. He was so good.

796
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:25,400
- You're really good. He's a natural.
- He is.

797
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:28,700
Um... I thought you guys
were out on a date last night.

798
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:30,200
We were.

799
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,300
So now
going on a date is reading Chekhov?

800
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:35,000
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.

801
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:37,700
I gotta get to the theatre.

802
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,800
Um... excuse me. Excuse me.

803
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,800
Um... can you give me a ride
to the theatre?

804
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:48,300
Why?

805
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,500
I'm a volunteer now.

806
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:57,000
You were never in any of those plays,
were you?

807
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,300
No.

808
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:00,900
But can you give me a ride?

809
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:12,300
Why didn't you listen to me? Why?

810
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:15,600
We can't turn back the clock now,
poor dear.

811
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,700
Crying, crying, crying.

812
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:20,000
Oh, God. This is driving me crazy.

813
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:22,700
- What?
- We could be digging right now.

814
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:26,500
- We could?
- If we were in that dressing room.

815
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:31,100
- It's rehearsal. There are people.
- Right. Just pissing me off.

816
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,300
Well, what can we do, Max?

817
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,800
What?

818
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:42,300
- I got an idea.
- What?

819
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,300
What if you played Lopakhin?

820
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:47,100
- What?
- If you played Lopakhin,

821
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,100
we could
get into that tunnel any time.

822
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:52,800
They have a Lopakhin.

823
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,400
- What if they didn't?
- What do you mean?

824
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:59,800
What do I mean?
What if they didn't have a Lopakhin?

825
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:02,500
I can't be Lopakhin.
I'm not an actor.

826
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:05,100
You're not a bank robber
and you're doing that.

827
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:06,600
Max, come on.

828
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:09,700
- She said you were a natural.
- So?

829
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:13,200
So a natural is a natural.
And a natural means you can do it.

830
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:17,000
- It doesn't.
- You're gonna be Lopakhin.

831
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:20,500
- There has to be another way.
- No. This is the way.

832
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:24,700
- I don't know, Max.
- You want the bank, don't you?

833
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:27,100
- Yeah, I do.
- Then you're gonna be Lopakhin.

834
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:29,500
End of story. You're gonna be great.

835
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:31,400
I swear to you.

836
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:33,500
- It's crazy.
- You're gonna be great.

837
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:35,200
I'll call you back.

838
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:39,000
Darek, she's taking
a phone call in the middle...

839
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:43,500
I did not take it.
It's exactly what I did not do.

840
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,500
Listen, I was thinking here,
you could step backstage.

841
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:59,800
- What's going on?
- You unprofessional...

842
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,700
- Mr Milodragovich.
...shit!

843
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:04,200
Arnold's quitting.

844
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:06,400
- What?
- He's quitting.

845
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:09,300
We're talking about Willie Loman.

846
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:12,600
The West End.
A Ken Waterstone production.

847
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:15,200
Ooh, a Ken Waterstone production!

848
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:16,800
The heavens have opened!

849
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:19,300
You're a lucky boy. Well, go, yes.

850
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:22,500
Run, run to that
pampering, populist...

851
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:24,000
Great!

852
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:30,700
...piece of shit Ken Waterstone
and his finest productions. Ha!

853
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:33,600
Goodbye, Darek. I'm sorry.

854
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:35,700
Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

855
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,700
We could have auditions
this afternoon.

856
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:47,700
- I have a list of...
- That's a shit list!

857
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,100
What do you want me to do?

858
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:51,300
I can't hear you when you're yelling.

859
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:04,800
What?

860
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:08,900
No, no, no, sorry.
I can't give you a ride.

861
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:11,500
I know, no. Before I start,

862
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:15,400
I just want you to remember
that you said he'd be a natural.

863
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:20,000
Stan, let me call you back.

864
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:22,500
- What?
- Henry.

865
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:24,500
- Henry what?
- He'd be perfect.

866
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:26,300
Perfect for what?

867
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:28,600
For Lopakhin.

868
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:31,200
You mean
Henry should play Lopakhin?

869
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:34,000
- Yes.
- What the fuck! He's not an actor!

870
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:37,100
Exactly. He's natural.
He'd just be playing himself.

871
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:40,300
Just give this a little thinkage.

872
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,600
The man is Lopakhin.

873
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:45,300
I mean, he's a man
who's come from nothing,

874
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:49,200
he's a man who's not afraid to create
a new life, put his past behind him,

875
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:51,500
and he's a man in love with you.

876
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,700
Er... Madame Ravinsky.

877
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:55,500
Ranevsky.

878
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:57,100
- What did I say?
- Ravinsky.

879
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:58,900
- I did?
- It's Ranevsky.

880
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,400
That's weird. OK.

881
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:05,400
Can you maybe
get him in to see Darek?

882
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:09,000
What's going on here, Max? Hm?

883
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,100
What's going on? What are you doing?

884
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:14,500
Listen. The truth is,
you need a Lopakhin

885
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:17,900
and Lopakhin needs a dressing room.

886
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:20,700
You did this, didn't you?

887
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:29,800
OK, that... that's fair enough.

888
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:38,200
OK. OK.

889
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,100
Confidence man.

890
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:44,200
- Now, get out.
- I was just... I was getting out.

891
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:46,400
Thanks.

892
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:54,300
You have no training,

893
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:56,200
you've never been in a production.

894
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:57,900
You don't even know the play.

895
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:00,100
I've read it.
I think I know this scene.

896
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:01,900
Oh, you think you know? What?

897
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:04,700
You're a peasant, a nobody.

898
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,400
Start.

899
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,500
Your brother Leonid Andrevich
says I'm an ups...

900
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:26,600
How can you perform Chekhov
and not be able to say Andre-ye-vich?

901
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:28,900
- Say it.
- Andreyevich.

902
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:31,700
Good. Got the name right. Continue.

903
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:35,800
Your brother Leonid Andreyevich
says I'm an upstart. A money-grubber.

904
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,600
A what?

905
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:40,500
- A money-grubber.
- Really?

906
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:42,000
Are you?

907
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:43,500
- No.
- No?

908
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:46,300
- No!
- No? But convince her, not me.

909
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:50,100
Convince her!

910
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:55,300
Your brother Leonid Andreyevich
says I'm an upstart. A money-grubber.

911
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:57,800
He can say whatever he likes.
I don't care a bit.

912
00:59:57,900 --> 00:59:59,700
Neither do I.

913
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,900
I just want you to believe in me,

914
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,400
like in the old days.

915
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:07,100
Now, do you, Djula?

916
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:10,300
Show me. Tell me.

917
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:14,900
Yes, please can you show us
something we don't know?

918
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:18,500
Good God in heaven.

919
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:20,800
My father
was one of your father's serfs,

920
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,700
and your grandfather's serf
before that.

921
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:24,500
Boring!

922
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:26,700
It's all ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

923
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:29,100
It must come from here.
Speak with your heart.

924
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:32,000
She's your angel.

925
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:34,600
Beg her. Beg her for forgiveness.

926
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:51,800
My father
was one of your father's serfs,

927
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:54,000
and your grandfather's serf
before that.

928
01:00:55,600 --> 01:01:00,100
But you, you did so much
for me in the old days.

929
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:02,900
I'd forgotten all that.

930
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:08,500
I love you.

931
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:10,500
Like a sister.

932
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:13,800
More than a sister.

933
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:20,200
You piece of shit! Don't you ever...

934
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:32,000
Not bad, Djula. Give me a hug.

935
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:33,700
- No.
- Give me a hug.

936
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:35,600
- No.
- Give me a hug.

937
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:37,500
No.

938
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:39,000
Come here. Come on.

939
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:40,700
I want to hold hands. Simone!

940
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:46,900
Argh!

941
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:18,100
Does this make me an accessory?

942
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:21,700
I think so.

943
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:23,900
Depends.

944
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:27,000
On what?

945
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:29,100
If I get caught.

946
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:41,100
Things have certainly gotten
more interesting since you showed up.

947
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:46,900
You mean, since you ran me over.

948
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:56,700
It's not about the money, is it?

949
01:02:57,600 --> 01:03:00,100
- No.
- Then why are you doing it?

950
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:06,100
I used to go along with everything.

951
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:08,600
I didn't know I could change it.

952
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:10,700
So now I'm changing it.

953
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:13,500
And robbing a bank is changing it?

954
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:15,800
It already has.

955
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:23,300
Can everybody gather round?
Darek wants to address the cast.

956
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,300
Thank you for coming, everybody.

957
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:28,700
I would like to introduce to you
Henry Smith.

958
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:32,900
From today, he's going
to do the part of Lopakhin.

959
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:35,000
If you please.

960
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:38,400
Thanks. Thank you.
Looking forward to it.

961
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:41,800
OK, let's take five minutes.
We'll go from the top of act three.

962
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:43,500
Top of act three, people.

963
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:07,700
Hold it.

964
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:40,200
Lower.

965
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:54,900
Henry.

966
01:04:55,700 --> 01:04:57,500
That is a shit-pile of brick.

967
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:01,100
Yeah.

968
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:04,800
I think we might need
another pair of hands.

969
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:13,600
No! No!

970
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:15,100
No!

971
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:17,200
You've gotta be kidding!

972
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:18,900
You suck!

973
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,600
You suck!

974
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:22,300
You suck!

975
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:26,300
How could you possibly
suck any more?

976
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:27,800
Sucker.

977
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,600
I suppose that's him?

978
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:32,300
Yeah, that's him.

979
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:34,000
No, no, no.

980
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:37,000
Thanks for meeting us.

981
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:39,000
Sure.

982
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:42,300
How are you, Joe?

983
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:44,200
How's the business?

984
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:47,000
- You mean the pyramid scheme?
- Yeah.

985
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:52,500
It all fell apart.
We were banking on that money, Henry.

986
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:56,000
And now all I got is a garage
full of dumb Korean plastic.

987
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,800
- Excuse me, um... what does that mean?
- Kitchenware.

988
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,400
You see what happens
when a person tries to go legit?

989
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:06,200
It's killing me.

990
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:09,600
- It's gonna be OK.
- Really? It is?

991
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:13,200
You know how much diapers cost?
Huh?

992
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:16,400
You know how much it costs
to send a kid to college?

993
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:18,500
You're sending your baby to college?

994
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:22,500
No, of course not.
But the kid needs stuff.

995
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:26,000
Stuff that's expensive.
Stuff he deserves.

996
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:30,500
Joe, we might be able to help.

997
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:32,100
Yeah? How?

998
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:33,600
We might have a job for you.

999
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:36,300
No fooling.

1000
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:39,300
These things are hot.

1001
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:40,900
I'm on fire.

1002
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:48,600
So what do you think?

1003
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:54,100
I think we should get some guns and
get the money through the front door.

1004
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:56,900
No guns. People could get hurt.

1005
01:06:57,100 --> 01:06:59,200
- What about fake ones?
- They're still guns.

1006
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:02,500
Joseph, we're not doing
one of those stupid robberies

1007
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:06,500
with tellers and tears
and chump change.

1008
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:10,000
We're digging right through
to the belly of the beast.

1009
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:12,000
Henry.

1010
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:14,600
Darek wants you on the stage.

1011
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:16,500
Now. Henry?

1012
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:19,000
I hope we don't get caught.

1013
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,100
He's on his way.

1014
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:32,600
Oh, thank you for joining us, Henry.

1015
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:35,100
I hope you're worth the wait.

1016
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:41,600
OK, er... places for
Lopakhin buys the orchard, all right?

1017
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:43,600
Let's pick it up from there.

1018
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:46,300
Places, please, for Lopahkin's speech.

1019
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:51,000
<i># Some people say</i>

1041
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:43,000
- If it's a boy, do I cut him or not?
- If you mean his dick, yeah.

1042
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:45,000
You!

1043
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:52,700
First I see you guys in the bank,

1044
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:57,500
then I see you guys
in the alley next to the bank,

1045
01:09:57,700 --> 01:10:02,100
now I see you coming out
of the theatre behind the bank.

1046
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:04,700
I know what you're up to, gentlemen.

1047
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:18,700
So what's on your mind, Frank?

1048
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:23,700
Indigenous currency retrieval
and exchange.

1049
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:27,100
Once a month,
a truck goes to all our partner banks

1050
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:29,800
across the border to Canada,

1051
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:33,000
takes up all the currency
and brings it back home.

1052
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:36,100
Let's say, on average,

1053
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:39,500
eight to twelve million
held in our vault for a short time

1054
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:42,100
before it's picked up
for redistribution.

1055
01:10:43,300 --> 01:10:47,900
Only a bunch of fools
would rob that bank any other time.

1056
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:50,500
I could give you the dates.

1057
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:54,700
I could help you with the alarms,
I could be your guy on the inside.

1058
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:57,600
Um... hypothetically,

1059
01:10:57,700 --> 01:11:00,700
let's just say you were right
about what we were doing,

1060
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:02,900
which you're not, of course,

1061
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:08,200
um... why would you help us
rob your own bank?

1062
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:13,300
- Got my reasons.
- This sounds like a set-up, man.

1063
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:17,500
I don't fuck around, kid.
Like I said, I got my reasons.

1064
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:20,600
Well, you'll just
have to forgive us, Frank.

1065
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:23,200
We have to hear 'em.

1066
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:29,600
Wife got sick a few years ago.

1067
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:32,600
Insurance wouldn't pick up
all the cost so I went to the bank.

1068
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:35,000
They wouldn't help
cover the difference.

1069
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:40,100
We were going to retire to France.
The Loire valley.

1070
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:45,100
We had to use all of our savings
to cover the bills.

1071
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:48,300
Spent everything we had.

1072
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:53,300
Then she died.

1073
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:01,200
I been 30 years at that place.

1074
01:12:03,100 --> 01:12:05,100
I'm sorry.

1075
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:07,400
November 23rd.

1076
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:11,900
The money's dropped off at eight
and picked up at midnight.

1077
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:14,700
I retire in two weeks.

1078
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,300
This is it.

1079
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:21,500
You set up that table,

1080
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:23,700
I'll make sure dinner arrives hot.

1081
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:32,500
Look,
why should I be ashamed to say it?

1082
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:35,100
Oh. Why should...

1083
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,100
Why should I be ashamed to say it?
I love him. I love him.

1084
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:42,800
My love is like a stone round my neck

1085
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,500
and it's dragging me down
to the bottom.

1086
01:12:45,700 --> 01:12:48,700
But... I love my stone.

1087
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:51,100
I... I can't live without it.

1088
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:53,700
For God's sake,
the man has robbed you!

1089
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:55,600
Oh, no, no, no. Don't say that!

1090
01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:58,100
He's a scoundrel.
Everybody sees it but you.

1091
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:00,000
A petty scoundrel. A user.

1092
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:02,100
And you are what? 26 or what?

1093
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:06,000
Ah, please, please,
please, please, stop.

1094
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:08,400
No. Look.

1095
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:14,300
Djula, I can hear you
because you're acting very loudly.

1096
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:17,700
But I can't feel you.

1097
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:23,900
Can I ask you a question?

1098
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:27,100
- It is very personal.
- Mm-hm.

1099
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:29,500
Have you ever been in love?

1100
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:32,800
- Of course.
- Huh. Liar.

1101
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,400
Fuck you, Darek!

1102
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:36,000
Then show us!

1103
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:37,900
Show us what love is all about.

1104
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:40,700
How it rips you apart
and then puts you together.

1105
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:44,800
It carries you to the heavens
and then smashes you to the ground.

1106
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:47,400
Now, if you want
to become a great actress,

1107
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:50,100
then you
have to reveal something, Djula.

1108
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:53,600
What are you so afraid of, huh?

1109
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:57,700
Maybe you want to die
old, alone, unemployed.

1110
01:13:57,900 --> 01:14:00,100
Is that what you want, hm?

1111
01:14:00,700 --> 01:14:02,500
Djula!

1112
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:07,200
Oh, that's right, Djula.

1113
01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:11,300
Run, Buffalotto. Run.

1114
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:12,900
You're very good at that.

1115
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:14,700
Five minutes, people.

1116
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:16,200
Five minutes, everyone.

1117
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:25,400
What?

1118
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:32,500
Are you OK?

1119
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:35,700
I... hate him.

1120
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:41,200
I'm a good actress.
I am a damn good actress.

1121
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:45,400
What, I have to love someone
to be a great actress? Horse shit.

1122
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:51,900
I've heard it my whole goddamn life.

1123
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:54,600
- What?
- That I'm cold.

1124
01:15:01,100 --> 01:15:02,800
No, you're not.

1125
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:11,900
Ice cold.

1126
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:20,000
Arctic cold.

1127
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:48,500
What?

1128
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:50,500
What?

1129
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:52,200
I can't do it.

1130
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:55,100
- You can't do what?
- I can't leave her, Max.

1131
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:57,000
Leave who? Do what?

1132
01:15:58,900 --> 01:16:01,200
- I can't do this.
- Henry.

1133
01:16:01,900 --> 01:16:03,800
Henry, listen.

1134
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:08,100
You forced me out of jail to help you

1135
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:10,600
and I'm gonna goddamn help you.

1136
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:17,000
See, I got through my whole life with
my mouth, you know, bullshitting.

1137
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:20,100
I've been nothing
but a fucking coward.

1138
01:16:20,300 --> 01:16:23,500
But now I am going to do something.

1139
01:16:23,700 --> 01:16:25,500
So here's the deal, Henry.

1140
01:16:27,700 --> 01:16:29,800
We're gonna dig this tunnel.

1141
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:34,000
Then we're gonna rob the bank
and we're gonna take the money,

1142
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:37,400
we're gonna put it in a car
and then we are going to drive away.

1143
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:42,900
Do you understand, Henry?

1144
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:46,600
Yeah.

1145
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:48,200
Yeah.

1146
01:16:52,100 --> 01:16:54,000
<i>Henry to the stage, please.</i>

1147
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:57,300
<i>Henry to the stage.</i>
<i>Lopakhin to the stage.</i>

1148
01:17:08,300 --> 01:17:10,100
I'll be right out.

1149
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,500
<i>Take a chance on life.</i>

1150
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:19,700
<i>Take a chance on Buffalotto.</i>

1151
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:25,400
Oh, I hate this commercial.

1152
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:28,900
- I like it.
- Why?

1153
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:31,300
You're in it.

1154
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:37,100
Come on. I'm starving. Let's go.

1155
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:42,300
We have to do it opening night.

1156
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:45,300
- What?
- It's the only time we can get in.

1157
01:17:48,100 --> 01:17:50,900
- But that's in two days.
- Yeah.

1158
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:56,400
So you're leaving?

1159
01:17:57,900 --> 01:17:59,500
Yeah.

1160
01:17:59,700 --> 01:18:01,100
Wow.

1161
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:03,700
Oh, wow.

1162
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:05,600
Fuck.

1163
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:08,500
Fuck, Henry.

1164
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:15,800
- I was thinking we could meet.
- What?

1165
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,200
I was thinking California.

1166
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:21,200
You were thinking
we could meet in California?

1167
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:23,000
Yeah.

1168
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:31,800
You know what?
You really are a thief, Henry.

1169
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,100
I mean, California?

1170
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:38,800
Why would I go anywhere with you?
You can't cross a fucking street.

1171
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:40,300
You wreck my play,

1172
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:42,300
you make me an accessory to a crime.

1173
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:44,700
I should call the cops
and you should go to hell.

1174
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:48,900
- I didn't know it would be this way.
- Henry, you're a bank robber.

1175
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:51,500
You're a bank robber. Henry.
You're a bank robber.

1176
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:54,000
Th... I mean,
you knew that you had to leave?

1177
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:57,000
- No.
- That's exactly what you wanted.

1178
01:18:57,100 --> 01:19:01,900
- So that we could be together.
- Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

1179
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:16,700
You know what?
We screwed a couple of times.

1180
01:19:16,900 --> 01:19:18,400
Right? So what?

1181
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:23,200
- It was more than that.
- No, really, just a couple of times.

1182
01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:28,200
We both knew
this would never work out, right?

1183
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:31,600
- I didn't.
- I did.

1184
01:19:35,300 --> 01:19:37,400
Go rob your bank.

1185
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:39,800
Go!

1186
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:13,200
You're a good man, Henry.

1187
01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:16,800
Yeah, Max.

1188
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:37,800
Enjoy the show.

1189
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,800
Enjoy the show.

1190
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:45,900
Tonight, my dear players,

1191
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:49,700
we can show our audience
that the future is something

1192
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:52,800
we really need to fear.

1193
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:56,400
And to recognise that
knowledge itself is never more real

1194
01:20:56,600 --> 01:21:00,400
than in the beauty
of our imagination.

1195
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:06,200
No, no, no.

1196
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,400
Shh, shh, shh.

1197
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,700
As we say in my home country,

1198
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:15,600
go out there and break some dicks.

1199
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:18,700
Off the cushion in the corner,
double into the centre pocket.

1200
01:21:18,900 --> 01:21:23,200
Ten minutes, people, ten minutes.

1201
01:21:40,700 --> 01:21:42,500
Curtain.

1202
01:21:50,300 --> 01:21:54,300
Thank God the train is in.

1203
01:21:55,300 --> 01:21:58,900
- What time is it?
- Almost two.

1204
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:01,100
It's light already.

1205
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:17,300
- How you doin', Frank?
- Doing good, Bernie.

1206
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:27,100
Oh, my, the nursery!

1207
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:35,100
Oh, my dear, sweet,
beautiful nursery.

1208
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:38,300
I used to sleep here
as a little girl.

1209
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:41,400
Your train was two hours late.
How do you explain that?

1210
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:43,300
Is that good management?

1211
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:46,000
I'm still like a little girl.

1212
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:10,800
You ever think what you could do
with all that money, Frank?

1213
01:23:10,900 --> 01:23:12,600
I know what you'd do.

1214
01:23:12,700 --> 01:23:15,100
You'd buy the Bills
and put them in first place.

1215
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:18,000
It'd take more money than that.

1216
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:20,200
Hey, get in there, get in there.

1217
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:37,100
I guarantee it, I'd get 'em back into
the Super Bowl within two seasons.

1218
01:23:37,300 --> 01:23:39,600
Perfect. Another chance to lose.

1219
01:23:39,700 --> 01:23:44,100
Oh, my childhood,
my innocent childhood.

1220
01:23:44,300 --> 01:23:46,600
I used to sleep in this nursery.

1221
01:23:46,700 --> 01:23:48,900
I looked out from here
into the garden

1222
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:52,600
and I woke up happy every morning.

1223
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:54,700
Oh, my cherry orchard.

1224
01:24:11,700 --> 01:24:14,000
Well, this is it, Frank.

1225
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:16,200
We got you something.

1226
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:19,100
A little er... retirement gift.

1227
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:24,200
- Oh, thank you, guys.
- We wanted it to be from France.

1228
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:26,500
Where is he?

1229
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:28,800
Where is that old geezer?

1230
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:32,200
It stinks in here.

1231
01:24:34,100 --> 01:24:37,300
- Oh, break a leg.
- The play's already started, Max.

1232
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:40,400
Oh, right. Oh, Julie. Goodbye.

1233
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:44,500
Goodbye, confidence man.

1234
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:49,700
Go. Go! Go!

1235
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:52,000
Nice of you to join us, old man.

1236
01:24:52,100 --> 01:24:54,700
Just do your goddamn job.

1237
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:01,600
What? What now?

1238
01:25:02,700 --> 01:25:05,200
Oh, no. No, no, not again.

1239
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:06,900
Jeez! Give me that.

1240
01:25:07,100 --> 01:25:09,000
- Sorry.
- Give me that. "Sorry"?

1241
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:11,000
You're a pussy, you know that, Joe?

1242
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:13,900
You're a real pussy.
Get off the cord.

1243
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:20,000
What should we do?

1244
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:22,200
Tell us what to do.

1245
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:26,900
I tell you every day. Every day
I say the same thing over and over.

1246
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,100
You must rent out the cherry orchard

1247
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:33,700
and the rest of the estate for
villas at once, right this second.

1248
01:25:33,900 --> 01:25:37,200
The auction is coming up very soon.

1249
01:25:37,300 --> 01:25:40,700
But it's all so vulgar.

1250
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,800
Aaaahhh!

1251
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,900
Welcome to my world, bitches.

1252
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,300
Fuck, yeah.

1253
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:43,100
Is the cherry orchard sold?

1254
01:26:43,300 --> 01:26:46,000
- Yes.
- Who bought it?

1255
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:48,900
I did.

1256
01:26:49,100 --> 01:26:51,100
I bought it.

1257
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:57,300
Wait a minute. Don't rush me.

1258
01:26:57,500 --> 01:26:58,900
I'm all dizzy.

1259
01:26:59,100 --> 01:27:01,100
I can't talk.

1260
01:27:01,300 --> 01:27:03,200
Oh.

1261
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:13,700
When we got to the auction,

1262
01:27:14,700 --> 01:27:16,500
Deriganov was already there.

1263
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:21,200
He bid 30, I bid 40,
he bid 45, I bid 55.

1264
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:24,500
You see, he kept going up five
while I went up ten.

1265
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:29,100
Well, it didn't take very long.

1266
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:34,700
The gavel sounded
and now the cherry orchard is mine.

1267
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:37,300
Mine!

1268
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:41,800
God! God in heaven!

1269
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:45,700
The cherry orchard is mine!

1270
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:50,800
Tell me I'm drunk.

1271
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:55,700
Tell me I'm out of my mind.

1272
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,400
Tell me I'm dreaming.

1273
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:13,600
- Is that it?
- Yes, it is.

1274
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,400
What's that, Eddie?

1275
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:21,200
It's a gun, Max. Joe, take the money
and put it in the car. Now.

1276
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:22,700
Joe.

1277
01:28:22,900 --> 01:28:26,100
- Just stay where you are.
- Don't fuck with me, old man.

1278
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:29,000
You wanna shoot me?
You're gonna have to kill me.

1279
01:28:29,100 --> 01:28:31,200
- No, no, no.
- Listen, stay out of this.

1280
01:28:32,300 --> 01:28:34,400
What are you doin', Eddie?

1281
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:37,600
Welcome to the party, Brando.

1282
01:28:38,900 --> 01:28:42,100
- What are you doin', Eddie?
- It's money, Henry, money.

1283
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:44,300
Come on, Eddie.
We're here, we're done.

1284
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:48,400
Shut up, Joe.
Take the money out to the car now.

1285
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:50,800
Go on, move. Move.

1286
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:54,200
No happy ending for you, my friend.

1287
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:56,500
Agh! You animal!

1288
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:58,600
Aaargh!

1289
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:00,400
Aaarghhh!

1290
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:12,000
Max.

1291
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:13,900
<i>Places, act four.</i>

1292
01:29:14,100 --> 01:29:16,200
<i>Places, act four.</i>

1293
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:19,000
<i>Act four places, people.</i>

1294
01:29:19,700 --> 01:29:21,500
<i>It's going very well, everyone.</i>

1295
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:23,500
I gotta get on stage.

1296
01:29:29,300 --> 01:29:31,000
Son of a bitch.

1297
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:37,400
The peasants
have come to say goodbye.

1298
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:39,700
They're good fellows,
Yermolai Alekseyevich,

1299
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:41,600
but, in my opinion, a little stupid.

1300
01:29:41,700 --> 01:29:45,400
You gave them everything
in your purse. Lyuba, that was wrong.

1301
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:48,000
I couldn't help it.
I couldn't help it.

1302
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:51,900
Won't you please
come and drink a glass as a goodbye?

1303
01:29:59,100 --> 01:30:01,000
Oh, man.

1304
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:44,600
Stop the car.

1305
01:30:44,700 --> 01:30:46,600
Joe, stop the car.

1306
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:48,400
We can't stop the car, Henry.

1307
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:52,400
- It's the getaway car.
- Stop the fucking car, Joe.

1308
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:55,000
Stop the fucking car, Joe!

1309
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:57,600
Stop the fucking car!

1310
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:01,700
What the hell are you doing?

1311
01:31:01,900 --> 01:31:03,300
He's leaving.

1312
01:31:03,400 --> 01:31:05,600
Leaving?

1313
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:09,900
Grapefruits as big as your head, Max.

1314
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,200
All-you-can-eat sunshine.

1315
01:31:13,700 --> 01:31:16,700
OK, kid. I'll be seeing you.

1316
01:31:17,700 --> 01:31:19,400
Yeah.

1317
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:22,000
I'll see you.

1318
01:31:26,500 --> 01:31:28,500
What's going on?

1319
01:31:28,700 --> 01:31:31,900
Just forget about it.
Let's get the hell out of here. Drive.

1320
01:31:32,100 --> 01:31:33,700
Don't speed.

1321
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:40,100
Dear Mother used to love
to walk about in this room.

1322
01:31:40,300 --> 01:31:42,600
My sister. My sister.

1323
01:31:44,900 --> 01:31:47,500
- Mama!
- Ah-ooo!

1324
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:50,100
I'm coming.

1325
01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:15,200
Wait! Wait!

1326
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:30,000
I had to come back.

1327
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:34,700
I couldn't get on the train.

1328
01:32:34,900 --> 01:32:36,900
The moment I stepped on the platform,

1329
01:32:37,100 --> 01:32:40,000
the blood drained from my heart.

1330
01:32:40,100 --> 01:32:43,500
I knew I would never see you again.

1331
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:49,000
What... is he doing?

1332
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:51,200
I had to come back.

1333
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:54,800
Oh, come on, Henry.
What is this? What are you doing?

1334
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,800
This is the only way you'll listen.

1335
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:06,600
You should have gotten on that
stupid train. You made a mistake.

1336
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:10,700
The mistake would have been leaving
and not telling you how I feel.

1337
01:33:10,900 --> 01:33:15,200
Don't pretend you care!
All you care about is money!

1338
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:17,500
- You think it's about money?
- Yes.

1339
01:33:17,700 --> 01:33:22,800
- It's never been about money.
- My sister. Everything all right?

1340
01:33:22,900 --> 01:33:25,400
- Get out!
- Don't you have a train to catch?

1341
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:27,600
Get out! Go away!

1342
01:33:27,700 --> 01:33:31,200
Well, here he is,
ladies and gentlemen.

1343
01:33:31,400 --> 01:33:36,600
The selfish peasant who's taken
the orchard right out from under us,

1344
01:33:36,700 --> 01:33:41,000
who's destroying it
right in front of our very eyes.

1345
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:46,600
Sometimes
you must destroy in order to create.

1346
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:49,100
We have to let go of our pasts
in order to live.

1347
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:51,800
You are no angel.
I see what you are by your actions.

1348
01:33:51,900 --> 01:33:54,000
I came back, didn't I?

1349
01:33:54,200 --> 01:33:56,300
I came back for you.

1350
01:33:59,900 --> 01:34:01,700
Henry, just...

1351
01:34:04,700 --> 01:34:06,300
...leave.

1352
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:08,600
Meet me in Moscow.

1353
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,700
Get off the fucking stage.

1354
01:34:16,100 --> 01:34:19,600
What? What are you running from?
What are you afraid of?

1355
01:34:19,700 --> 01:34:21,400
- I'm not afraid.
- Yes, you are.

1356
01:34:21,500 --> 01:34:26,200
- Of what, Henry? Tell me.
- You're afraid...

1357
01:34:26,300 --> 01:34:28,700
...because I love you.

1358
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:34,100
What?

1359
01:34:34,200 --> 01:34:37,100
Meet me in Moscow.

1360
01:34:37,300 --> 01:34:39,700
Tell me you'll meet me in Moscow.

1361
01:34:39,900 --> 01:34:41,600
Go with him!

1362
01:34:41,700 --> 01:34:43,700
Meet him in Moscow!

1363
01:34:54,900 --> 01:34:59,200
- Meet me.
- Light... lights down ten.

1364
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:01,300
OK.

1365
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:06,500
Ten more.

1366
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:18,700
Ah, fuck, Henry.

1367
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:45,100
<i># Let them knock upon my door</i>

1368
01:35:49,100 --> 01:35:52,500

01:36:22,100 --> 01:36:26,200

1376
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:31,200
