Here it is --

2
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:34,602
four years after
my mother's death,

3
00:01:34,626 --> 00:01:36,727
and it seems as if
everyone has moved on

4
00:01:36,751 --> 00:01:39,935
except for me.

5
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:41,975
The reflections
of my hurt and pain

6
00:01:41,999 --> 00:01:46,143
have had a tendency
to stagnate me.

7
00:01:46,167 --> 00:01:49,975
It used to take me only
a day or two to write a song,

8
00:01:49,999 --> 00:01:51,226
but I've been
picking this song up

9
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:56,727
and putting it back down
going on about four years now.

10
00:01:56,751 --> 00:02:00,518
Where did all my inspiration go?

11
00:02:00,542 --> 00:02:05,810
Where are all the answers
to the questions in my head?

12
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:10,727
Lord, I don't hear
your voice anymore.

13
00:02:10,751 --> 00:02:15,101
Have you left me, too?

14
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:19,727
Have you left me, too, Lord?

15
00:02:19,751 --> 00:02:28,143
Have you left me, too?

16
00:02:28,167 --> 00:02:31,975
-Man, it is hot as hell in here.

17
00:02:31,999 --> 00:02:33,975
It don't make no sense.

18
00:02:33,999 --> 00:02:35,185
You know I was downtown.

19
00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:39,768
I think I seen Harriet Tubman
catching a cab.

20
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:41,975
-You got that right.

21
00:02:41,999 --> 00:02:43,975
-Yeah, you sure right.

22
00:02:43,999 --> 00:02:46,185
But it ain't too hot for you
to grind it out in that studio,

23
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:47,685
though, right?

24
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,518
-Well, I was thinking.

25
00:02:49,542 --> 00:02:50,976
-You ought to be trying
to come up with a song

26
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,101
that's gonna be a big hit
on the R&B charts

27
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:54,226
and stop thinking.

28
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,685
You need to be writing!

29
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:58,268
-No, Freddy, Alicia.

30
00:02:58,292 --> 00:03:00,894
She wants to enter this new
songwriters competition,

31
00:03:00,918 --> 00:03:02,518
and if she wins, then,
you know --

32
00:03:02,542 --> 00:03:03,975
-Listen, listen, listen.

33
00:03:03,999 --> 00:03:06,351
If she don't win,
and she loses,

34
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:08,518
tell her she's got a job
at my law office,

35
00:03:08,542 --> 00:03:10,018
or on my new record label.

36
00:03:10,042 --> 00:03:11,727
The same go for you.

37
00:03:11,751 --> 00:03:14,018
-No thanks to
the office thing, bro.

38
00:03:14,042 --> 00:03:15,975
It's a gospel competition.
-Uh-huh.

39
00:03:15,999 --> 00:03:17,602
It's gonna be held
at the Berklee School of Music.

40
00:03:17,626 --> 00:03:20,185
So if she wins, she'd get
some scholarship money.

41

-Oh, that's cool.

to help her be able to do it.

in the footsteps

00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:36,975

on my music and my ministry."

to be at the office?

-Bye, Gary.

1741

-As I said before,
Ms. Washington,

01:17:33,959 --> 01:17:35,101

we're just trying to,
uh, close this case out.

1744
01:17:37,459 --> 01:17:39,935
Um, I feel bad about your son,

1745
01:17:39,959 --> 01:17:41,999
but there's nothing
I can do about it.

1746
01:17:47,167 --> 01:17:50,351
-What you said?

1747
01:17:50,375 --> 01:17:53,101
-Ms. Washington, I've said
this over and over again.

1748
01:17:53,125 --> 01:17:55,810
There's nothing we can do for...
-Did you? Okay, so anyways,

1749
01:17:55,834 --> 01:17:56,975
I don't know
what you talking about,

1750
01:17:56,999 --> 01:17:57,975
but I'm-a say what I got to say.

1751
01:17:57,999 --> 01:18:00,643
Look, I got three kids, okay?

1752
01:18:00,667 --> 01:18:03,685
And what I need you to do is
help me get my three kids back

1753
01:18:03,709 --> 01:18:05,602
because they just giving me
the runaround.

1754
01:18:05,626 --> 01:18:08,101
It makes me...
It gets on my nerves and stuff,

1755
01:18:08,125 --> 01:18:09,518
and I need you...

1756
01:18:09,542 --> 01:18:10,852
Okay, this is
the paper they gave me

1757
01:18:10,876 --> 01:18:12,975
the last time,
and they told me,

1758
01:18:12,999 --> 01:18:14,727
"You can get your kids back,
Ms. Washington.

1759
01:18:14,751 --> 01:18:16,975
You can get your kids back,"
and I said, "Well, that's cool,

1760
01:18:16,999 --> 01:18:18,226
'cause I'm Shaniqua
de Shaquan Washington,

1761
01:18:18,250 --> 01:18:20,351
and you don't play me
for no fool,"

1762
01:18:20,375 --> 01:18:22,935
so they said I can
get my kids back,

1763
01:18:22,959 --> 01:18:24,975
then they found that crack...
-Ms. Washington, Ms. Washington.

1764
01:18:24,999 --> 01:18:25,976
-...that one time.
-Ms. Washington,

1765
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,643
you're rambling.

1766
01:18:27,667 --> 01:18:29,477
-I'm trying to tell you
my story about the crack

1767
01:18:29,501 --> 01:18:31,810
when they found it
and took my kids.

1768
01:18:31,834 --> 01:18:33,560
So, they found the crack.
They took my kids.

1769
01:18:33,584 --> 01:18:35,268
And, you know, that was dirty
when they took them

1770
01:18:35,292 --> 01:18:37,435
and, you know, little,
little de Shaquan was sticky,

1771
01:18:37,459 --> 01:18:39,226
but she was gonna be alright.

1772
01:18:39,250 --> 01:18:42,975
And, um, okay, so when
they found it and stuff,

1773
01:18:42,999 --> 01:18:44,975
and then I said, "I just
slipped up that one time,"

1774
01:18:44,999 --> 01:18:46,768
and then the lady was like,
"We don't really care,

1775
01:18:46,792 --> 01:18:49,975
'cause we gonna take your kids."
-Ms. Washington, please.

1776
01:18:49,999 --> 01:18:52,768

coming this afternoon.

1777

01:18:54,167 --> 01:18:55,976
-I'm not saying that.
-What you trying to say?

1779
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,976
-I'm saying we need
to tie this up,

1780
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,435

in about 20 years.

1872
01:22:46,584 --> 01:22:49,643
And I came across
this scripture, uh...

1873
01:22:49,667 --> 01:22:52,643
Samuel 2:12,

1874
01:22:52,667 --> 01:22:57,810
and -- and -- and it talked
about this poor farmer,

1875
01:22:57,834 --> 01:23:01,351
who was out in the woods,
and he found a lamb,

1876
01:23:01,375 --> 01:23:02,975
and he took the little lamb in,

1877
01:23:02,999 --> 01:23:06,101
and -- and he fed the lamb,
and h-he gave the lamb water,

1878
01:23:06,125 --> 01:23:09,101
and he cleaned the lamb,
and he even let his --

1879
01:23:09,125 --> 01:23:12,018
his lamb sleep
with his children,

1880
01:23:12,042 --> 01:23:16,560
and he held the lamb in his arms
like it was one of his own.

1881
01:23:16,584 --> 01:23:18,852
And there was a -- a --
a -- a rich farmer

1882
01:23:18,876 --> 01:23:22,477
who lived not too far away
from the poor farmer,

1883
01:23:22,501 --> 01:23:25,143
and then a stranger
came to town one day,

1884
01:23:25,167 --> 01:23:28,935
and you know what
the rich farmer did?

1885
01:23:28,959 --> 01:23:31,310
He took that lamb,

1886
01:23:31,334 --> 01:23:34,351
and he sacrificed that lamb
from that poor farmer

1887
01:23:34,375 --> 01:23:37,143
and gave it to the stranger,

1888
01:23:37,167 --> 01:23:39,935
and God,
it said in the scriptures,

1889
01:23:39,959 --> 01:23:42,935
condemned that man,

1890
01:23:42,959 --> 01:23:45,268
the rich man.

1891
01:23:45,292 --> 01:23:48,727
Sheila, I am that man.

1892
01:23:48,751 --> 01:23:50,143
I am the man who turned you

1893
01:23:50,167 --> 01:23:52,226
against the one
who honestly loved you.

1894
01:23:52,250 --> 01:23:54,435
I am the man who turned you
into a hypocrite.

1895
01:23:54,459 --> 01:24:00,560
Look, stop talking
like that, Freddy.

1896
01:24:00,584 --> 01:24:02,975
You go into that church...

1897
01:24:02,999 --> 01:24:05,477
every Sunday,

1898
01:24:05,501 --> 01:24:08,477
and you put your mask on.

1899
01:24:08,501 --> 01:24:11,351
And you praise Jesus,
and you shout "Hallelujah"

1900
01:24:11,375 --> 01:24:15,185
to the preacher man
every Sunday, Sheila!

1901
01:24:15,209 --> 01:24:19,351
And you got that mask on like
nobody can see who you are,

1902
01:24:19,375 --> 01:24:23,185
and you keep that mask on
for a few pleasurable moments,

1903
01:24:23,209 --> 01:24:25,975
and then God takes that mask off

1904
01:24:25,999 --> 01:24:30,975
for the whole world to see.

1905
01:24:30,999 --> 01:24:33,975
Bad company...

1906
01:24:33,999 --> 01:24:36,268
corrupts good manners, Sheila.

1907
01:24:36,292 --> 01:24:37,976
Don't you see that?
-No, wh-wh-wh--

1908
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,894
What does all of this mean,
Freddy?

1909
01:24:40,918 --> 01:24:43,435
What are you talking about?
-We -- we -- we -- we -- we --

1910
01:24:43,459 --> 01:24:46,018
We've been doing wrong so long,

1911
01:24:46,042 --> 01:24:49,518
you can't even see
what's right anymore, Sheila.

1912
01:24:49,542 --> 01:24:50,894
Think about it.
-Okay, fine.

1913
01:24:50,918 --> 01:24:52,435
You know, baby,
if you want to stop this,

1914
01:24:52,459 --> 01:24:55,685
we can just try and stop.
-No, we can't try!

1915
01:24:55,709 --> 01:25:00,975
We can't try.
We got to do it.

1916
01:25:00,999 --> 01:25:03,185
I kept...

1917
01:25:03,209 --> 01:25:07,852
I kept reading
that scripture, Sheila.

1918
01:25:07,876 --> 01:25:10,727
And it talked about
two deaths --

1919
01:25:10,751 --> 01:25:15,310
two deaths as I kept reading on.

1920
01:25:15,334 --> 01:25:21,268
And, you know, [chuckles]
I-I grew up in church, Sheila...

1921
01:25:21,292 --> 01:25:22,602
and I -- and I...

1922
01:25:22,626 --> 01:25:24,059
As I got older,
and I start becoming

1923
01:25:24,083 --> 01:25:25,810
more successful in my practice,

1924
01:25:25,834 --> 01:25:29,518
I start looking at all the lies
and all the deceit

1925
01:25:29,542 --> 01:25:31,351
and all the stuff
that went on in church,

1926
01:25:31,375 --> 01:25:34,975
and I lost -- I lost --
I lost favor with church.

1927
01:25:34,999 --> 01:25:37,768
I-I-I just got confused,

1928
01:25:37,792 --> 01:25:39,975
and I shut it all down,

1929
01:25:39,999 --> 01:25:43,435
and I stopped believing
in God, Sheila,

1930
01:25:43,459 --> 01:25:47,059
[voice breaking] and now
God is punishing me.

1931
01:25:47,083 --> 01:25:49,018
-God is not punishing you,
Freddy.

1932
01:25:49,042 --> 01:25:52,852
What are you talking about?

1933
01:25:52,876 --> 01:25:54,894

[ Sobbing ] Sheila...

1935
01:25:58,292 --> 01:26:02,975
I went to the doctor.

1936
01:26:02,999 --> 01:26:06,018
And the doctor told me...

1937
01:26:06,042 --> 01:26:08,101
God, I don't know
how to tell you.

1938
01:26:08,125 --> 01:26:11,101
-What is it, Freddy?

1939
01:26:11,125 --> 01:26:21,935
The doctor told me I had
full-blown AIDS, Sheila.

1940
01:26:21,959 --> 01:26:23,727
-Oh, God.

1941

-Yeah, he immersed.

a mouthful of Grandma's
famous old coleslaw.

You see, I start off with
the cabbage and the carrot,

1988
01:28:07,792 --> 01:28:09,975
and then you put in a pineapple,
kiwi with the fur on it,

1989
01:28:09,999 --> 01:28:12,185
then cherries, bananas,
grapes, and onions.

1990
01:28:12,209 --> 01:28:13,518
Then you wrap it up
in a burrito,

1991
01:28:13,542 --> 01:28:14,975
put it on the grill, right?

1992
01:28:14,999 --> 01:28:16,975

Mm, this gum is good.

Never mind, but anyway,
then we take it off the grill.

1995

After about five minutes,
you open it back up,

That's a secret.

2000
01:28:26,999 --> 01:28:28,226

you roll it back up,

01:28:28,250 --> 01:28:29,685
dip it in Listerine, shut up,

2002
01:28:29,709 --> 01:28:31,975
put it in the freezer,
four seconds.

When you pull it out, lay it out
like a cinnamon roll,

like that right there.

-Okay.

-My solo...

2058

You know what?
It was like...

2059
01:30:38,999 --> 01:30:40,935
It was like the first time
when I picked up the instrument.

2060
01:30:40,959 --> 01:30:42,768
It was like the first time
I ever played.

2061

2062
01:30:43,999 --> 01:30:46,018

was sitting on my shoulder

singing and humming

2064
01:30:47,709 --> 01:30:51,185

every note to play.

2065

It was actually pretty amazing.

I need to tell you.

-Really?
-Yeah.

2072
01:31:07,834 --> 01:31:11,059
-Okay. Well, I got something
I need to tell you, as well.

2073
01:31:11,083 --> 01:31:14,018
-Okay.
Well, you go first.

-Okay.
Well, Alicia...

2075
01:31:17,292 --> 01:31:18,852
You know, she's been worried

2076
01:31:18,876 --> 01:31:20,393
this songwriter's
competition,

2077
01:31:20,417 --> 01:31:23,310
and, you know,
she's been bugging me about it,

2078
01:31:23,334 --> 01:31:26,975
so she decided to submit
one of her works early

2079
01:31:26,999 --> 01:31:29,768
just to kind of,
you know, test it out,

2080
01:31:29,792 --> 01:31:30,975
and, baby...

2081
01:31:30,999 --> 01:31:33,976
I didn't know my daughter
was this talented!

2082
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,852
I mean, I'm listening
to her song.

2083
01:31:35,876 --> 01:31:38,810
It is blowing me away.
I'm talking about...

2084
01:31:38,834 --> 01:31:40,975
The song is talking
about integrity

2085
01:31:40,999 --> 01:31:42,727
and --and -- and honor,

2086
01:31:42,751 --> 01:31:44,560
pointing it all back to Christ.

2087
01:31:44,584 --> 01:31:45,975
-Yeah.

2088
01:31:45,999 --> 01:31:47,852
-I'm thinking to myself,
"I better start taking time

2089
01:31:47,876 --> 01:31:51,310
and listening to her music
before she become famous!"

2090
01:31:51,334 --> 01:31:52,894
So, anyway,
she submitted the song

2091
01:31:52,918 --> 01:31:54,310
to the cast
and director yesterday.

2092
01:31:54,334 --> 01:31:55,976
Of course, he was surprised
that, you know,

2093
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:59,935
she submitted it kind of early,
and when he listened to it,

2094
01:31:59,959 --> 01:32:02,435
it automatically made her
a finalist.

2095
01:32:02,459 --> 01:32:03,768
-Wow.
-Yeah!

2096
01:32:03,792 --> 01:32:06,768
He says, "Listen. You submit
one more song like that,

2097
01:32:06,792 --> 01:32:07,975
he's gonna introduce
her to some people

2098
01:32:07,999 --> 01:32:09,602
that can help her get
in the music business."

We don't have the money

to submit the rest
of our material, right?

-No! No, it's not that.
