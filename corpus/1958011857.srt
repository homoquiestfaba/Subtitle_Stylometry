Um, keep going, keep going.

359
00:19:39,152 --> 00:19:43,555
That's 28 generations
from David to Jesus,

360
00:19:43,555 --> 00:19:47,459
yet we say Jesus was
the son of David.

361
00:19:47,459 --> 00:19:50,729

00:19:57,003 --> 00:19:59,805
-It's as long as it should be.
-I know. I know.

366
00:19:59,805 --> 00:20:02,608
It's just a lot of detail
to take in all at once.

367
00:20:02,608 --> 00:20:04,276
Sam, that's the whole point.

368
00:20:04,276 --> 00:20:05,978
The detail is what makes
the passage so relevant.

369
00:20:05,978 --> 00:20:07,346
It's not the passage.

370
00:20:07,346 --> 00:20:10,183

deliver it with a little...

what I've got to say?

Everything I have worked for

What? I knock on the door
and you jump out the window?

531
00:29:52,231 --> 00:29:53,999
What's the matter with you, man?

532
00:29:53,999 --> 00:29:56,068
I wasn't expecting you.

533
00:29:56,068 --> 00:29:58,638
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

534
00:29:58,638 --> 00:30:02,007
Yeah, I just-- I freaked out.

535
00:30:02,007 --> 00:30:06,545
Yeah, well... good thing
you, uh, saved the candlesticks.

536
00:30:15,488 --> 00:30:17,990
You in for the night?

537
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:21,226
No, I told you.
Picked up a shift.

538
00:30:21,226 --> 00:30:23,629
Just grabbing a sandwich.

539
00:30:23,629 --> 00:30:26,565
Brought your keys. (sniffs)

540
00:30:26,565 --> 00:30:28,934
Well, can I get mine back?

541
00:30:28,934 --> 00:30:32,338
-Um...
-You lost mine, too.

542
00:30:32,338 --> 00:30:34,973
-I'll look around.
-Yeah.

543
00:30:34,973 --> 00:30:37,510
Where's Sam? Thought you were
hanging out tonight?

544
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:40,245
Yeah. He couldn't make it.

545
00:30:42,481 --> 00:30:45,351
-Who couldn't make it?
-Sam.

546
00:30:45,351 --> 00:30:47,419
Samantha. Your girlfriend.

547
00:30:47,419 --> 00:30:50,422
Yeah, she couldn't make it.

548
00:30:55,828 --> 00:30:58,531
You sure you didn't hit your
head diving out that window?

549
00:30:58,531 --> 00:31:01,133
(laughs)

550
00:31:06,706 --> 00:31:08,507
Sam's here.

551
00:31:09,542 --> 00:31:11,444
(door closes)

552
00:31:12,779 --> 00:31:15,782
-(knocking on door)
-Hold on.

553
00:31:26,959 --> 00:31:29,928
-(knocking)
-Come in.

554
00:31:37,503 --> 00:31:38,838
Sam.

555
00:31:40,506 --> 00:31:42,274
I need an answer.

556
00:31:43,175 --> 00:31:44,343
Okay.

557
00:31:44,343 --> 00:31:46,879
If I decide to go--
which I might--

558
00:31:46,879 --> 00:31:49,615
are you gonna be able
to fit that into your plan?

559
00:31:49,615 --> 00:31:52,585
Because if you can,
we need to talk about it,

560
00:31:52,585 --> 00:31:55,888
and if you can't,

561
00:31:55,888 --> 00:31:58,157
we need to talk about that.

562
00:32:04,997 --> 00:32:06,999
I don't want to talk.

563
00:32:09,468 --> 00:32:10,969
Great.

564
00:32:10,969 --> 00:32:14,774
Sam, I know you're upset,

565
00:32:14,774 --> 00:32:16,642
and I'm sorry...

566
00:32:18,344 --> 00:32:20,680
but it's not gonna
do either of us any good

567
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,148
to make a decision
in this state.

568
00:32:23,148 --> 00:32:27,052
I think we should just clear our
heads for a few days, you know?

569
00:32:27,052 --> 00:32:29,054
Step back a little.

570
00:32:31,657 --> 00:32:34,760
You look weird.

571
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,261
Yeah?

572
00:32:38,063 --> 00:32:39,998
You look great.

573
00:32:39,998 --> 00:32:41,667
Let me take you out
tomorrow night.

574
00:32:41,667 --> 00:32:44,236
We'll have fun.

575
00:32:44,236 --> 00:32:46,772
(sighs) Tomorrow?
You can't tomorrow. It's Sunday.

576
00:32:46,772 --> 00:32:49,174
You have your study group.

577
00:32:49,174 --> 00:32:51,510
Mm, doesn't matter.
I'll cancel it.

578
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:53,412
I just want to spend
some time with you.

579
00:32:53,412 --> 00:32:55,915
Then we'll deal with this,
I promise.

580
00:32:58,050 --> 00:33:00,519
Come on.
We'll paint the town red.

581
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:03,489
(laughs)

582
00:33:03,489 --> 00:33:05,691
"Paint the town red"?

583
00:33:05,691 --> 00:33:07,693
Just say yes.

584
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:13,265
O-Okay.

585
00:33:13,265 --> 00:33:15,267
Two days.

586
00:33:15,267 --> 00:33:18,003
Good. I'll walk you out.

587
00:33:29,481 --> 00:33:30,917
Where's your brother?

588
00:33:30,917 --> 00:33:33,886
(panting) What?

589
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:36,789
Where's your brother?

590
00:33:36,789 --> 00:33:38,758
My brother's dead.

591
00:33:41,527 --> 00:33:44,897
I'm onto you, Jeremiah Davis.

592
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:46,732
No scorpion.

593
00:33:48,434 --> 00:33:51,403
(engine starts)

594
00:33:53,338 --> 00:33:55,374
Finally.

595
00:33:57,376 --> 00:34:00,746
(door opens, closes)

596
00:34:04,583 --> 00:34:06,218
Hola.

597
00:34:06,218 --> 00:34:09,021
-Great.
-I win.

598
00:34:09,021 --> 00:34:11,657
That's the difference
between you and me, TJ.

599
00:34:11,657 --> 00:34:14,660
You think we're in competition.
I just think you're an idiot.

600
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:17,095
And I think
it's gonna be a holiday

601
00:34:17,095 --> 00:34:18,998
watching Rome bust you up.

602
00:34:18,998 --> 00:34:21,701
Hmm, I don't think
I ever realized till now

603
00:34:21,701 --> 00:34:24,436
just how ugly you are.

604
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,043
Look at that. I got your gun.

605
00:34:30,043 --> 00:34:32,177
Like, two seconds ago,
you was all tough,

606
00:34:32,177 --> 00:34:33,813
and you was, like,
swinging around,

607
00:34:33,813 --> 00:34:36,716
and now, look, here I am,
I'm holding it.

608
00:34:36,716 --> 00:34:38,718
You suck at this, TJ.

609
00:34:38,718 --> 00:34:41,353
I can't believe
you're not dead yet.

610
00:34:42,488 --> 00:34:46,124
-My brother's alive?
-Temporarily.

611
00:34:47,459 --> 00:34:49,294
That's impossible.

612
00:34:49,294 --> 00:34:51,296
(sighs)

613
00:34:51,296 --> 00:34:53,499
How do you fit into this?

614
00:34:53,499 --> 00:34:56,936
-Does Rome know I'm here?
-I'm not saying nothing, man.

615
00:34:56,936 --> 00:34:58,571
(gasps) Nah, nah.

616
00:34:58,571 --> 00:35:00,940
He, uh, he found
your brother's address,

617
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:04,944
-so he sent me here to check.
-So nobody else knows I'm here?

618
00:35:07,346 --> 00:35:08,814
Okay.

619
00:35:09,916 --> 00:35:10,983
(sighs)

620
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:15,755
Now, where is my money?

621
00:35:15,755 --> 00:35:17,423
-I-I don't know.
-(door opens, closes)

622
00:35:17,423 --> 00:35:20,426
I don't know anything.

623
00:35:22,528 --> 00:35:24,663
No luck, boss. He slipped town.

624
00:35:24,663 --> 00:35:26,164
Here's what you're gonna do.

625
00:35:26,164 --> 00:35:28,034
You're gonna go back
and you're gonna tell Rome

626
00:35:28,034 --> 00:35:30,937
that you looked around
but you didn't find me.

627
00:35:30,937 --> 00:35:33,472
You give me some of the 50 Gs
and I'll do it.

628
00:35:33,472 --> 00:35:36,976
TJ, the guy who can
keep his hands on the gun

629
00:35:36,976 --> 00:35:38,310
makes the rules.

630
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:39,946
Think about it this way.

631
00:35:39,946 --> 00:35:43,082
If I go now,
I'm out of your life for good

632
00:35:43,082 --> 00:35:45,584
and Rome never needs
to hear how you paid

633
00:35:45,584 --> 00:35:47,120
for your little
yellow pickup truck.

634
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,221
It's not a pickup,
it's an El Camino.

635
00:35:49,221 --> 00:35:51,124
And how did you
pay for it again?

636
00:35:51,124 --> 00:35:53,960
That's right.
You ripped off Rome.

637
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,628
I've been meaning
to tell him about that.

638
00:35:55,628 --> 00:35:57,496
So unless you want
to start taking the bus

639
00:35:57,496 --> 00:35:58,831
with two broken ankles,

640
00:35:58,831 --> 00:36:02,401
I suggest you go tell Rome
I slipped town.

641
00:36:02,401 --> 00:36:03,836
What do you mean, slipped town?

642
00:36:03,836 --> 00:36:06,238
I mean he slipped town,
like, he's gone.

643
00:36:06,238 --> 00:36:10,009
Good, good, good, good,
good, good, good, good.

644
00:36:10,009 --> 00:36:12,377
He slipped town

645
00:36:12,377 --> 00:36:15,114
with my 50,000.

646
00:36:15,114 --> 00:36:16,816
(grunts)

647
00:36:16,816 --> 00:36:17,817
(groans)

648
00:36:17,817 --> 00:36:19,819
(panting)

649
00:36:25,257 --> 00:36:27,559
Yo, this is messed up.
It's your brother.

650
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:30,029
Don't you understand
Rome will kill him?

651
00:36:30,029 --> 00:36:33,666
What my brother gets,
he deserves.

652
00:36:39,672 --> 00:36:41,540
Now, get off my yard.

653
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:46,712
Fingerprints on this gun

654
00:36:46,712 --> 00:36:50,582
will put your brother away
for the rest of his life.

655
00:36:51,884 --> 00:36:54,419
Now, I can either
give it to the police,

656
00:36:54,419 --> 00:36:57,056
or I can chuck it in the river.

657
00:36:57,056 --> 00:36:59,324
It's your choice.

658
00:37:01,861 --> 00:37:05,531
I know what you did on
the bridge that night, preacher.

659
00:37:08,934 --> 00:37:12,471
Must be a real shock to find out
your brother's still alive,

660
00:37:12,471 --> 00:37:16,375
but I'm gonna give you a chance
to make things right.

661
00:37:18,677 --> 00:37:22,114
Now... now, you could
either stay and do this

662
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:26,351
or you can get up and walk out
and abandon him again.

663
00:37:28,821 --> 00:37:30,455
But you decide right now.

664
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,269
What do I have to do?

665
00:37:44,269 --> 00:37:46,806
There, see, it is true.

666
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:49,642
All roads lead to Rome.

667
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:51,644

You'll be very pleased to hear
that, for this morning's sermon,

676
00:38:53,906 --> 00:38:56,508
-I will not be speaking.
-(congregation laughs)

677
00:38:56,508 --> 00:39:00,980
Instead, a certain very busy
deacon who we all know

678
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:03,348
will be giving
his first official sermon

679
00:39:03,348 --> 00:39:07,253
entitled
"The Genealogy of Christ."

680
00:39:07,253 --> 00:39:09,322
Jeremiah?

Is he okay?

WOMAN 2:
Oh, he'll be fine.

Shh, shh, shh.

687
00:39:40,452 --> 00:39:43,555
Um...

00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:51,697
genealogy of...

691
00:39:51,697 --> 00:39:53,699
Christ.

692
00:39:56,468 --> 00:39:57,803
(man clears throat)

693
00:39:59,538 --> 00:40:02,608
I was gonna talk about that,

694
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:07,813
but instead,
let's just talk about...

695
00:40:07,813 --> 00:40:09,915
-money.
-(congregation murmurs)

696
00:40:09,915 --> 00:40:12,218
Look around you.

697
00:40:12,218 --> 00:40:14,353
We all got a lot of money.

698
00:40:14,353 --> 00:40:16,421
MAN:
We do?

699
00:40:16,421 --> 00:40:18,757
Can I get an amen?

700
00:40:20,293 --> 00:40:21,827
(man coughing quietly)

701
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:26,765
But not everyone
is as fortunate as we are.

702
00:40:26,765 --> 00:40:28,968
I mean, there are people
out there right now

703
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:32,771
who need money,

704
00:40:32,771 --> 00:40:34,840
and I believe...

705
00:40:36,675 --> 00:40:40,646
...I believe it is a sin

706
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:44,650
for us to turn our backs

707
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:47,987
I'm-I'm talking about
good people here.

708
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:49,655
I'm talking about good people

709
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:51,857
who may not have
a lot of choices

710
00:40:51,857 --> 00:40:53,892
'cause they're living
on the streets,

711
00:40:53,892 --> 00:40:57,963
and it is hard to see

712
00:40:57,963 --> 00:41:01,334
the Almighty
when your stomach is empty.

713
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:03,069
-Amen?
-MAN: Amen.

714
00:41:03,069 --> 00:41:05,104
Thank you.

715
00:41:05,104 --> 00:41:08,274
Now, my brother and I,
we were raised on the streets.

716
00:41:08,274 --> 00:41:10,843
We used to play
in burned-out buildings.

717
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:12,345
I was fortunate enough
to get out,

718
00:41:12,345 --> 00:41:13,946
but my brother wasn't so lucky.

719
00:41:13,946 --> 00:41:16,282
J's got a brother?

720
00:41:16,282 --> 00:41:18,284
Doesn't like to talk about it.

721
00:41:18,284 --> 00:41:21,153
And there are other kids
out there right now

722
00:41:21,153 --> 00:41:23,989
who will fall
into the same cycle

723
00:41:23,989 --> 00:41:26,525
-of crime and violence.
-(congregation murmuring)

724
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:29,462
These kids are falling
through the cracks.

725
00:41:29,462 --> 00:41:33,933
Even now, as we sit here,
they have no food, no money,

726
00:41:33,933 --> 00:41:38,404
and, worst of all,
they have no hope.

727
00:41:38,404 --> 00:41:40,606
We got to do
something about this.

728
00:41:40,606 --> 00:41:42,942
We got to do something
about this right now.

729
00:41:42,942 --> 00:41:46,145
We need to put our money
where our mouths are.

730
00:41:46,145 --> 00:41:49,181
So I suggest that
this morning's collection

731
00:41:49,181 --> 00:41:51,516

an outreach program

Don't you think
that God would like that?

881
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:44,891
You get between them and
their case and you stay there.

882
00:49:44,891 --> 00:49:47,259
You know what it takes
to get a guy to walk away

883
00:49:47,259 --> 00:49:49,094
from a million dollars?

884
00:49:49,094 --> 00:49:51,230
20 million dollars.

885
00:49:51,230 --> 00:49:53,966
Remember, the secret
to serving a really good meal

886
00:49:53,966 --> 00:49:57,670
is to give them something
they do not expect.

887
00:49:57,670 --> 00:50:01,139
Stop!
There's too much money in here.

888
00:50:01,139 --> 00:50:02,641
What, are you
going behind my back?

889
00:50:02,641 --> 00:50:03,843
Don't worry about it.

890
00:50:03,843 --> 00:50:05,678
Are you marking another price
for yourself?

891
00:50:05,678 --> 00:50:09,248
-We have an arrangement.
-Forget it. Deal's off.

892
00:50:09,248 --> 00:50:13,218
No, this is my deal.
It's my money.

893
00:50:15,788 --> 00:50:18,290
I don't need you anymore,
old man.

894
00:50:18,290 --> 00:50:20,760
And that's... when you shoot me.

895
00:50:22,929 --> 00:50:25,664
-And I don't mean one shot.
-(clicking)

896
00:50:25,664 --> 00:50:26,766
You empty that thing into me.

897
00:50:26,766 --> 00:50:28,333
(TJ laughs)

898
00:50:30,035 --> 00:50:32,304
ROME: Look at them. They're not
thinking about money anymore.

899
00:50:32,304 --> 00:50:34,774
They're thinking about bullets.

900
00:50:34,774 --> 00:50:36,675
(siren wailing)

901
00:50:36,675 --> 00:50:38,110
Now, they got a choice.

902
00:50:38,110 --> 00:50:40,312
They can either go
for their money and get shot...

903
00:50:40,312 --> 00:50:42,581
-Police! Freeze!
-...stay and get caught...

904
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:44,416
-Kneel down!
-...or cut their losses

905
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:47,152
-and run for it.
-(speaking Japanese)

906
00:50:47,152 --> 00:50:48,654
You stay where you are.

907
00:50:48,654 --> 00:50:50,489
(shouting in Japanese)

908
00:50:53,358 --> 00:50:55,294
They're gone. (laughs)

909
00:50:55,294 --> 00:50:57,863
Let me feel it.
I want to feel it.

910
00:50:57,863 --> 00:51:00,666
-Whoo! Ooh, it's heavy.
-(both laugh)

911
00:51:00,666 --> 00:51:04,503
-He did it!
-(laughs)

912
00:51:04,503 --> 00:51:06,438
-That guy was like... (whoops)
-(whoops)

913
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:07,673
(laughs)

914
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:14,981
ROME:
And that's the dessert.

915
00:51:16,582 --> 00:51:19,752
-I don't know.
-Don't know what?

916
00:51:19,752 --> 00:51:21,787
Well, this may surprise you,
but in seminary,

917
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:23,689
they don't teach about
guns and handcuffs.

918
00:51:23,689 --> 00:51:25,591
Trust me, kid,
I'll show you everything.

919
00:51:25,591 --> 00:51:27,793
-You'll do fine.
-(sighs)

920
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:29,628
Have some faith in yourself.

921
00:51:34,033 --> 00:51:35,434
-Sunny.
-(taps plate)

922
00:51:35,434 --> 00:51:38,203
Eat your dinner.

923
00:51:38,203 --> 00:51:42,441
Okay, now let me hear it again.
Julie?

924
00:51:42,441 --> 00:51:45,078
Please give money
to help inner-city kids.

925
00:51:45,078 --> 00:51:46,311
Okay, good.

926
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:49,615
Now, all of you, show me
your saddest faces.

927
00:51:49,615 --> 00:51:51,717
Come on! Sadder!

928
00:51:51,717 --> 00:51:53,218
This is important.

929
00:51:55,554 --> 00:51:57,389
Okay, good.

930
00:51:57,389 --> 00:52:00,125
Now, hit the streets.

931
00:52:00,125 --> 00:52:02,294
Take no prisoners.

932
00:52:16,308 --> 00:52:18,410
Not bad, except for the drop.

933
00:52:18,410 --> 00:52:21,447
Now, remember, keep it natural.
Don't favor that side.

934
00:52:21,447 --> 00:52:23,148
No one should know
you're gonna pull a gun.

935
00:52:23,148 --> 00:52:24,349
But it's slipping.

936
00:52:24,349 --> 00:52:27,820
Then do it again,
and again a million times.

937
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:34,760
You know, I could really
make you into something.

938
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:37,329
Let me ask you something,
preacher.

939
00:52:37,329 --> 00:52:39,799
You think people got free will?

940
00:52:39,799 --> 00:52:41,333
I believe people
have the freedom

941
00:52:41,333 --> 00:52:43,102
to make their own decisions.

942
00:52:45,104 --> 00:52:47,539
But God has a plan, right?

943
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:50,943
Absolutely. He has a plan
for everyone's life.

944
00:52:50,943 --> 00:52:52,711
-Even yours, Rome.
-Mm-hmm.

945
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:55,081
All right, keep that going.

946
00:52:55,081 --> 00:52:57,215
So this crime
you're about to commit--

947
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:59,451
that's part of God's plan
for your life?

948
00:52:59,451 --> 00:53:01,320
No, you're making me do this.

949
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:04,857
Oh, so you're saying
I have power over God.

950
00:53:04,857 --> 00:53:07,192
That's not what I'm saying.
You're twisting my words.

951
00:53:07,192 --> 00:53:09,695
I'm saying I'm doing this
to help my brother,

952
00:53:09,695 --> 00:53:10,963
and that's a good thing.

953
00:53:10,963 --> 00:53:12,832
Well, you can't just
ignore the bad thing.

954
00:53:12,832 --> 00:53:15,434
I mean, you're stealing
from people here.

955
00:53:15,434 --> 00:53:18,437
I'm pretty sure that's a sin.

956
00:53:18,437 --> 00:53:20,506
If you'd just give me the gun
with the fingerprints on it,

957
00:53:20,506 --> 00:53:21,507
I wouldn't have to do this.

958
00:53:21,507 --> 00:53:23,575
You don't have to do this.

959
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:26,278
I mean, if you're so certain
that God has this good plan...

960
00:53:26,278 --> 00:53:28,147
Are you trying
to talk me out of this?

961
00:53:28,147 --> 00:53:30,116
Nope, never.

962
00:53:30,116 --> 00:53:32,284
I'm just trying to figure out
what you're doing here.

963
00:53:32,284 --> 00:53:34,520
You seem to think it's right
to steal from the innocent

964
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:35,888
just so your criminal brother

965
00:53:35,888 --> 00:53:37,389
doesn't get the justice
he deserves.

966
00:53:37,389 --> 00:53:39,257
Yes. He's my brother.

967
00:53:39,257 --> 00:53:41,627
So what you're saying is
it is better

968
00:53:41,627 --> 00:53:43,829
to take care
of things yourself...

969
00:53:43,829 --> 00:53:45,597
even if it means
going against God.

970
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:46,699
-No.
-'Cause God's got

971
00:53:46,699 --> 00:53:48,801
-this big plan, right?
-Yes.

972
00:53:48,801 --> 00:53:52,004
And was it God's plan that
I saved your brother's life?

973
00:53:52,004 --> 00:53:53,238
What?

974
00:53:53,238 --> 00:53:55,808
That I dragged him from
the river and took him in?

975
00:53:55,808 --> 00:53:59,244
Was it God's idea... for you
to leave him there to die?

976
00:53:59,244 --> 00:54:01,113
No, I don't, I don't know!

977
00:54:01,113 --> 00:54:02,982
You don't know?

978
00:54:02,982 --> 00:54:05,417
You don't know what's right,
and you don't know what's wrong.

979
00:54:05,417 --> 00:54:07,086
So why are you here?

980
00:54:07,086 --> 00:54:09,955
I'm here to save
my brother, that's it.

981
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:11,523
Exactly.

982
00:54:11,523 --> 00:54:13,592
You're here to save
your brother's life,

983
00:54:13,592 --> 00:54:16,762
so you can just forget
everything else.

984
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:21,400
Come on, do it again.

985
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:23,136
Do it again.

986
00:54:32,945 --> 00:54:38,151
11,415 bucks.

987
00:54:38,151 --> 00:54:40,019
Thanks, God.

988
00:54:41,587 --> 00:54:44,289
Yeah, I was talking
to Steve Bergen

989
00:54:44,289 --> 00:54:47,526
about a $50,000 investment
for the Boca Raton deal.

990
00:54:47,526 --> 00:54:52,131
I wanted to find out if I could
get in on that for just ten.

991
00:54:52,131 --> 00:54:54,333
All right,
can you page him, then?

992
00:54:54,333 --> 00:54:56,502
-Sure.
-(knocking on door)

993
00:54:56,502 --> 00:55:00,539
Yeah-- Hey, have him
ask for Jeremiah.

994
00:55:03,142 --> 00:55:06,612
(door opens, closes)

995
00:55:09,581 --> 00:55:10,983
Wow.

996
00:55:10,983 --> 00:55:12,718
(chuckles)

997
00:55:12,718 --> 00:55:14,620
You ready for dinner?

998
00:55:16,355 --> 00:55:19,358
Yeah. Sure.

999
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:21,961
Fugazi's or the Lampliter?

1000
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:27,099
Let's try something different.
You decide.

1001
00:55:28,034 --> 00:55:29,035
Really?

1002
00:55:29,035 --> 00:55:32,104
Yeah. Anything you want.

1003
00:55:32,104 --> 00:55:33,438
My treat.

1004
00:55:34,606 --> 00:55:36,542
Okay. (chuckles)

1005
00:55:38,978 --> 00:55:41,047
Should-should I get dressed up?

1006
00:55:42,915 --> 00:55:44,150
Yeah.

1007
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:47,320

Let me ask you something.

00:57:22,281 --> 00:57:24,250
Okay. What?

1043
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:28,254
If you could live anywhere,
where would it be?

1044
00:57:31,623 --> 00:57:32,958
That is a stupid question.

1045
00:57:32,958 --> 00:57:35,828
-Hey, I want to know.
-Why?

1046
00:57:35,828 --> 00:57:39,298
'Cause I've been answering
your questions all night.

1047
00:57:41,067 --> 00:57:42,935
Scotland.

1048
00:57:42,935 --> 00:57:45,071
Scotland, really?

1049
00:57:45,738 --> 00:57:47,306
Why Scotland?

1050
00:57:48,574 --> 00:57:50,576
That's where
my real dad is from.

1051
00:57:51,610 --> 00:57:53,879
I always wanted to go there.

1052
00:57:55,448 --> 00:57:57,649
I didn't know that.

1053
00:57:57,649 --> 00:58:00,886
Find a quiet little town
close to the water.

We used to sneak out

There was this little
empty space under the stairwell

1092
01:00:01,307 --> 01:00:05,344
where we'd get a flashlight,
and we'd stay there for hours,

telling each other stories
about getting out into the world

we got moved to this
really bad neighborhood.

1099
01:00:22,761 --> 01:00:26,865
And this gang of kids

1100
01:00:26,865 --> 01:00:28,700
were chasing us.

And, uh,

1102
01:00:31,904 --> 01:00:36,108
and we're trying to hide
under this old metal bridge.

1103
01:00:38,077 --> 01:00:40,812

were beating him up pretty bad.

I just stayed down, watching.

1109
01:00:57,896 --> 01:01:01,200
And they struggled, and he fell
off the side of the bridge

1110

01:06:55,087 --> 01:06:58,557

-How many stacks you got?

1227
01:06:58,557 --> 01:07:00,927
-There's not enough here, Rome.
-Make it work.

1228
01:07:03,829 --> 01:07:06,498
Sunny, hold the gun straight.

1229
01:07:06,498 --> 01:07:09,067
I don't want to hold the gun.

You know that, right?
(laughs softly)

1237

Man, these things

-(radio crackling)

1239
01:07:33,425 --> 01:07:35,060
Stop touching.

1240
01:07:36,495 --> 01:07:39,164
Let me ask you something.

1241
01:07:39,164 --> 01:07:41,500
How come you never told me
you had a brother?

1242
01:07:43,268 --> 01:07:45,270
You didn't know that?

1243
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:47,439
How would I?

1244
01:07:47,439 --> 01:07:49,441
I don't know.

1245
01:07:50,442 --> 01:07:53,178
I don't know why
I didn't tell you.

1246
01:07:53,178 --> 01:07:56,281
I guess it's just hard
for me to talk about.

1247
01:07:58,317 --> 01:08:00,085
I should've told you.

1248
01:08:05,892 --> 01:08:07,226
TEX: You're not at all
worried about him?

1249
01:08:07,226 --> 01:08:09,461
No, I'm not.
I think it's great.

1250
01:08:09,461 --> 01:08:11,664
We've been going through
a lot of stuff recently,

1251
01:08:11,664 --> 01:08:13,833
and he's had
a real breakthrough.

1252
01:08:13,833 --> 01:08:16,702
I haven't seen him
like this in years.

1253
01:08:16,702 --> 01:08:18,337
(exhales) I don't know.

1254
01:08:18,337 --> 01:08:20,873
-I don't like it.
-Well, I do like it.

1255
01:08:20,873 --> 01:08:23,676
So do me a favor
and stay out of it, please.

1256
01:08:23,676 --> 01:08:25,011
See, you don't live with him.

1257
01:08:25,011 --> 01:08:26,378
I'm telling you,
something is up.

1258
01:08:26,378 --> 01:08:30,215
Oh, would you just get out
of here and go catch a bad guy?

1259
01:08:30,215 --> 01:08:31,383
But wait, wait, wait.

1260
01:08:31,383 --> 01:08:34,053
What do you know
about his brother?

1261
01:08:36,089 --> 01:08:38,657
Just that he died.

1262
01:08:38,657 --> 01:08:40,659
-His brother's dead?
-Yeah.

1263
01:08:40,659 --> 01:08:43,228
He died when they were 14.

1264
01:08:43,228 --> 01:08:44,563
They were twins.

1265
01:08:44,563 --> 01:08:46,331
That's why it's so difficult
for him.

1266
01:08:46,331 --> 01:08:48,166
That's what I'm saying.

1267
01:08:48,166 --> 01:08:50,736
He has a twin brother, and he's
never talked to me about it?

1268
01:08:50,736 --> 01:08:52,304
He'll talk to you about it
when he wants

1269
01:08:52,304 --> 01:08:53,739
to talk to you about it.

1270

-I have.
-No, you haven't.
