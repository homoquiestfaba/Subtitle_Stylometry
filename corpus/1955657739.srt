83
00:07:48,275 --> 00:07:52,013
We tend to think of memories
as these filed-away facts

84
00:07:52,046 --> 00:07:54,248
stored safely in the
brain, when in actuality,

85
00:07:54,281 --> 00:07:56,550
everything that's
happened to you

86
00:07:56,583 --> 00:08:00,054
since the event you remember

87
00:08:00,087 --> 00:08:03,190
has altered the
memory of that event,

88
00:08:03,223 --> 00:08:07,695
providing a new filter through
which you experience it,

89
00:08:07,728 --> 00:08:11,599
a filter that
changes, and forgets,

90
00:08:11,632 --> 00:08:16,103
and exaggerates, and
combines, and morphs.

91
00:08:16,136 --> 00:08:21,075
But the pure experience does
still exist within you,

92
00:08:21,109 --> 00:08:23,378
for your brain has the ability

93
00:08:23,411 --> 00:08:27,950
to remember every event
that's ever happened to you,

94
00:08:27,983 --> 00:08:30,119
down to the greatest of detail.

95
00:08:31,286 --> 00:08:35,057
The problem is you have
no way of recalling it,

96
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:38,360
no way to clear the
filters of time

97
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:40,930

98
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,966

108
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,583
the actual memory
from their brain

109
00:10:07,616 --> 00:10:10,153
and displaying it before them,

110
00:10:10,186 --> 00:10:12,488
providing the opportunity
to understand

111
00:10:12,521 --> 00:10:16,192
and, more importantly,
cope with their past.

112
00:10:16,225 --> 00:10:22,399
Pure, uncluttered,
unfiltered truth.

113

you set out to do.

119
00:10:45,021 --> 00:10:48,392
After what Neil just disclosed minutes
before I had to go out there!

120
00:10:48,425 --> 00:10:50,561
He shouldn't have put such
a concern before you.

121
00:10:50,594 --> 00:10:51,762
I have a right to know!

122
00:10:51,795 --> 00:10:53,797
It in no way changes
the science.

123
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:56,567
Then why did you
keep it from me?

124
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,270
I wish you'd see that
I was protecting you.

125
00:11:02,739 --> 00:11:04,274
I'll tie up all the loose ends.

126
00:11:04,307 --> 00:11:07,111
All the research indicates
the machine is safe.

127
00:11:07,144 --> 00:11:10,114
I want more time. Those
patients are my responsibility.

128
00:11:10,147 --> 00:11:12,516
Look, Gordon, you are
a brilliant man.

129
00:11:12,549 --> 00:11:14,518
You've developed
something extraordinary,

130
00:11:14,551 --> 00:11:17,354
something that will rival the
world's greatest inventions.

131
00:11:17,387 --> 00:11:19,490
It will perfect the legal
system, cure Alzheimer's,

132
00:11:19,523 --> 00:11:24,128
but more importantly,
it'll help people heal.

133
00:11:25,362 --> 00:11:28,332
Focus on the good it'll bring.

134
00:11:28,365 --> 00:11:29,433
Be proud.

135
00:11:31,668 --> 00:11:34,138

I want them back.

140

Well, get them. Gordon,

142
00:11:58,963 --> 00:12:00,164
Ahem.

to verify the research.

146
00:12:07,305 --> 00:12:10,875

147
00:12:10,908 --> 00:12:14,445
And that you'd use them
to manipulate me...

148
00:12:14,478 --> 00:12:16,714
You know that's not

149
00:12:16,747 --> 00:12:18,450
What happened, Gordon?

150
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,786
What happened?

151
00:12:21,819 --> 00:12:24,256
Gordon, please, just tell me.

Let's take a picture.

155
00:13:54,914 --> 00:13:55,949
Is it picture time?

156
00:13:55,982 --> 00:13:57,517
Get... Get ready!
- Okay!

157
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:00,287
This is gotta be good,
don't mess it up.

158
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,855

159
00:14:01,888 --> 00:14:05,959
Okay, we're together.

160
00:14:05,992 --> 00:14:07,861
Cheese!

161
00:14:10,363 --> 00:14:13,600
Daddy, come on! Let's
go build a sandcastle!

162
00:14:15,902 --> 00:14:20,040
I can't think of a time in my
life when I've been happier.

163
00:14:23,609 --> 00:14:25,478
Me neither.

164
00:14:25,511 --> 00:14:28,815

Todd, what are you doing here?

168
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:46,800
We should talk.
- Uhh...

169
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:50,470
This isn't entirely appropriate.
What can I do for you?

170
00:14:50,503 --> 00:14:53,707
You brought things back...
- To help you work through them.

171
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:58,745
Things that should've
stayed buried in the past.

172
00:14:58,778 --> 00:15:02,415
It's a process, Todd. It can be difficult.
I've explained that.

173
00:15:02,449 --> 00:15:06,420
You fucked up my head!
- No. No, I didn't, Todd.

174
00:15:06,453 --> 00:15:10,358
You came to me hurt and injured.
We're moving forward...

175
00:15:10,391 --> 00:15:13,627
No. No, you...

176
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:16,430
You came to me.

My life? My life
was better before.

178
00:15:28,675 --> 00:15:30,911

179
00:15:30,944 --> 00:15:34,648
and now you're gonna
make a bunch of money?

180
00:15:34,681 --> 00:15:37,552
Todd. Todd, listen to me.

181
00:15:38,619 --> 00:15:39,954
Jesus, Todd!

182
00:16:35,944 --> 00:16:39,981
I can't think of a time in my
life when I've been happier.

183
00:16:40,014 --> 00:16:41,983
Me neither.

184
00:16:42,016 --> 00:16:45,954
Everything in its right place.

185
00:18:44,007 --> 00:18:45,876
No bullet wounds.

186
00:18:45,909 --> 00:18:48,946
Yes, but those are bullet
holes, aren't they?

187
00:18:48,979 --> 00:18:50,314
Mm-hmm.

188
00:18:50,347 --> 00:18:52,883
Well, they weren't
there yesterday.

189
00:18:54,818 --> 00:18:57,955
Any recent arguments,
disagreements between Mr. Dunn

190
00:18:57,988 --> 00:18:59,723
and anyone here at the company?

191
00:18:59,756 --> 00:19:03,861
No, no. None that I'm aware of.

192
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,865
Gonna need to see the
security footage,

193
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:11,335
names of all the people with
access to this building.

194
00:19:12,369 --> 00:19:13,737
Yes, of course.

195
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:22,880
Come on, that's a good girl.

196
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,752
Carolyn.

197
00:19:36,327 --> 00:19:38,162
Gordon
Dunn was not only

198
00:19:38,195 --> 00:19:39,697
a profoundly brilliant man,

199
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:41,399
but a profoundly good man,

200
00:19:41,432 --> 00:19:44,102
a rare combination
in my experience,

201
00:19:44,135 --> 00:19:45,803
and one that made him

202
00:19:45,836 --> 00:19:49,073
an extraordinary
person to be around.

203
00:19:49,106 --> 00:19:50,942
I count myself lucky...

204
00:19:53,744 --> 00:19:56,915
I count myself fortunate...

205
00:20:00,051 --> 00:20:03,355
for every moment I was able
to spend in his company.

206
00:20:05,156 --> 00:20:07,925
This is a terrible loss.

207
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:13,297
He was a true pioneer, and
his work will live on.

208
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:15,366
We will mourn him
deeply at Cortex

209
00:20:15,399 --> 00:20:19,303
as we begin to recover
from the shock.

210
00:20:19,336 --> 00:20:22,774
This is not just a Cortex loss,

211
00:20:22,807 --> 00:20:25,243
this is the world's loss.

212
00:20:26,711 --> 00:20:28,946
Why have the police
opened an investigation?

213
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:31,749
While we have no doubt that
he died of natural causes,

214
00:20:31,782 --> 00:20:33,351
we simply want to
be beyond certain

215
00:20:33,384 --> 00:20:35,687
that nothing
unscrupulous took place,

216
00:20:35,721 --> 00:20:37,356
given the unfortunate timing.

217
00:20:37,389 --> 00:20:40,793
But rest assured,
it will not delay

218
00:20:40,826 --> 00:20:43,195
or alter the production
of the machine.

219
00:20:43,228 --> 00:20:44,330
Thank you.

220
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,216
Neil, what do you have?

221
00:21:04,249 --> 00:21:07,486
Well, you're not gonna like it.
- Surprise me.

222
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:09,855
Well, as you know, the final
stages of the Rememory machine

223
00:21:09,888 --> 00:21:11,423
were completed almost entirely

224
00:21:11,456 --> 00:21:13,192
by Gordon himself,
the essential steps.

225
00:21:13,225 --> 00:21:16,361
Yes, but he must've left behind
extensive notes, plans...

226
00:21:16,394 --> 00:21:18,931
You know how secretive
and protective he was.

227
00:21:18,964 --> 00:21:21,200
That's why he demanded using
actual glass for the memories

228
00:21:21,233 --> 00:21:23,235
instead of storing them
on a closed cloud server.

229
00:21:23,268 --> 00:21:26,038
We're in his network, but
all his data is encrypted,

230
00:21:26,071 --> 00:21:27,306
and sophisticatedly so.

231
00:21:27,339 --> 00:21:29,041
I mean, it's actually
quite brilliant...

232
00:21:29,074 --> 00:21:33,378
Are you telling me that
we can't reverse engineer

233
00:21:33,411 --> 00:21:35,380
the product that we engineered?

234
00:21:35,413 --> 00:21:38,918
Not without Gordon's prototype,
at least not for some time.

235
00:21:41,087 --> 00:21:43,523
Define "some time."

236
00:21:43,556 --> 00:21:46,827
A year? Optimistically.

237
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:55,802
Well. Well, it
can't just be lost.

238
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:05,879
Thank you. Bye.

239
00:22:28,334 --> 00:22:30,103
I'm testing you.

240
00:22:30,136 --> 00:22:32,906
I don't think you remember.
- The sea lion.

241
00:22:32,939 --> 00:22:35,241
Yes, yes!

242
00:22:35,274 --> 00:22:36,810
Weeks after we showed them,

243
00:22:36,843 --> 00:22:39,412
we showed them numbers and
symbols on the cards,

244
00:22:39,445 --> 00:22:40,914
and then weeks after,

245
00:22:40,947 --> 00:22:43,149
they could correctly
identify the matching cards.

246
00:22:43,182 --> 00:22:46,853
That's amazing. Their brains are
a quarter the size of ours.

247
00:22:46,886 --> 00:22:49,522
Mm. So that alone is
advanced cognitive function,

248
00:22:49,556 --> 00:22:52,426
but you know what was
really incredible?

249
00:22:52,459 --> 00:22:53,994
Hmm, what?

250
00:22:54,027 --> 00:22:56,597
They could remember the whole
thing ten years later.

251
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:58,532
People can't even do that.

252
00:22:58,565 --> 00:23:00,535
Some people in particular!

253
00:23:16,149 --> 00:23:17,518
Hi.
- Hello.

254
00:23:18,418 --> 00:23:20,221
Hi.
- Um. Sorry.

255
00:23:20,254 --> 00:23:23,123
I'm James Klinch. I'm
here for the reception.

256
00:23:23,156 --> 00:23:25,392
Yes, I'm sorry, I
sent everyone away.

257
00:23:25,425 --> 00:23:30,531
I just, I couldn't take any more
mindless platitudes. I'm sorry.

258
00:23:30,564 --> 00:23:32,066
Thanks for coming.

259
00:23:51,285 --> 00:23:53,087
Time heals all wounds.

260
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,157
Uh... that's a really bad joke.

261
00:23:57,191 --> 00:23:58,894
The platitudes...

262
00:23:58,927 --> 00:24:01,096
It's quite cheeky under
the circumstances, yeah.

263
00:24:01,129 --> 00:24:04,900
I know you want to be alone,
but I just wanted to say

264
00:24:04,933 --> 00:24:08,036
how truly sorry I am. Truly.

265
00:24:08,069 --> 00:24:09,104
Thank you.

266
00:24:10,605 --> 00:24:12,207
How did you know Gordon?

267
00:24:15,076 --> 00:24:16,511
He saved my life.

268
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:21,149
Now, that's a story
I'd like to hear.

269
00:24:23,418 --> 00:24:24,887
Thank you.

270
00:24:30,358 --> 00:24:31,960
You can help me clean up.

271
00:24:41,235 --> 00:24:44,940
We happened to be staying at
the same hotel one night.

272
00:24:44,973 --> 00:24:49,611
He was there for a conference,
and I was there...

273
00:24:49,644 --> 00:24:53,648
because my life
hadn't worked out,

274
00:24:53,681 --> 00:24:56,919
not the way I imagined,
and I was in a bad place.

275
00:24:58,353 --> 00:25:01,657
And the hotel was a
very tall building.

276
00:25:04,293 --> 00:25:06,662
There was a terrible
storm that night,

277
00:25:06,695 --> 00:25:08,230
but it was strangely warm.

278
00:25:08,263 --> 00:25:10,333
It felt like a
hurricane was coming.

279
00:25:12,034 --> 00:25:14,570
I couldn't sleep, so I went
down to the hotel bar.

280
00:25:14,603 --> 00:25:16,439
It was a typical hotel bar,

281
00:25:16,472 --> 00:25:18,140
which is to say

282
00:25:18,173 --> 00:25:22,011
it's really the only thing
I can remember about it.

283
00:25:22,044 --> 00:25:25,148
But Gordon was sitting
there, having a nightcap.

284
00:25:26,682 --> 00:25:28,952
He seemed lost in thought.

285
00:25:29,651 --> 00:25:32,722
I was... drowning in mine.

286
00:25:35,024 --> 00:25:37,626
After a few moments, he
turns to me and he says,

287
00:25:37,659 --> 00:25:39,362
"This night can go
one of two ways.

288
00:25:39,395 --> 00:25:42,698
Either we can sit here drinking
alone with our thoughts,

289
00:25:42,731 --> 00:25:44,600
or we can make
something out of it."

290
00:25:46,101 --> 00:25:49,205
He smiled and ordered
a bottle of whiskey.

291
00:25:50,339 --> 00:25:51,607
This whiskey.

292
00:25:53,809 --> 00:25:56,379
And we talked about
everything under the sun.

293
00:25:56,412 --> 00:25:57,680
I mean everything.

294
00:25:59,448 --> 00:26:01,284
Our whole life story.

295
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:08,557
I told him things I had
never told anyone before.

296
00:26:08,591 --> 00:26:12,062
I don't know, maybe it was the
storm or the booze, or...

297
00:26:12,095 --> 00:26:16,199
something, it just felt like
the last night of the world.

298
00:26:16,232 --> 00:26:19,169
We had so much to drink
that we go up to the roof

299
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:23,106
with the idea that we'll make
it until the sun comes up,

300
00:26:23,139 --> 00:26:26,576
and we go out there in the
middle of this storm.

301
00:26:26,609 --> 00:26:28,445
I mean, the wind
is blowing hard.

302
00:26:28,478 --> 00:26:33,217
I remember thinking just how
powerful wind could actually be.

303
00:26:34,818 --> 00:26:39,189
Against the storm, my problems,
they seemed so trivial.

304
00:26:41,257 --> 00:26:44,694
We tried to get back inside,
but the door was locked,

305
00:26:44,727 --> 00:26:47,664
so we were stuck out
there all night.

306
00:26:47,697 --> 00:26:53,070
I woke up the next morning and
somehow I knew I'd be okay,

307
00:26:53,103 --> 00:26:55,105
that I'd live.

308
00:26:59,142 --> 00:27:01,745
Surviving that
storm, it saved me.

309
00:27:04,647 --> 00:27:06,216
If Gordon could still love life

310
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:08,285
after everything
he'd been through,

311
00:27:08,318 --> 00:27:09,386
how could I not?

312
00:27:12,789 --> 00:27:14,624
He never told me that story.

313
00:27:14,658 --> 00:27:16,661
I've never told
anyone that story.

314
00:27:18,529 --> 00:27:20,498
We stayed in touch a few times,

315
00:27:20,531 --> 00:27:24,469
but really our friendship
was meant for one night.

316
00:27:27,171 --> 00:27:28,539
I'm a little bit jealous.

317
00:27:28,572 --> 00:27:30,875
It makes me feel like I
didn't know him anymore...

318
00:27:30,908 --> 00:27:34,379
not since our daughter...

319
00:27:36,347 --> 00:27:38,183
I guess maybe I didn't
for a long time.

320
00:27:39,583 --> 00:27:41,385
You can convince
yourself that you do,

321
00:27:41,418 --> 00:27:45,523
but then a complete stranger
shows up, tells you a story...

322
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:50,428
...then you realize, God, I
didn't even scratch the surface.

323
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:51,896
Yeah, I see, I'm sorry.
I didn't...

324
00:27:51,929 --> 00:27:55,366
No, I'm... I'm really
glad that you did.

325
00:27:59,904 --> 00:28:02,207
Do you remember the last
conversation you had?

326
00:28:04,642 --> 00:28:06,478
Mm, I wish I didn't.

327
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,316
I lost my brother.

328
00:28:12,383 --> 00:28:13,451
Long time ago.

329
00:28:14,485 --> 00:28:15,820
I'm sorry.

330
00:28:17,621 --> 00:28:20,791
I was there when he died.

331
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:22,693
He said something to me,

332
00:28:22,727 --> 00:28:26,365
but I can't remember
what he said.

333
00:28:27,499 --> 00:28:30,702
I can remember every
detail of that night,

334
00:28:30,735 --> 00:28:33,438
except the last words
he said to me.

335
00:28:33,471 --> 00:28:37,309
It's funny how important
the details become.

336
00:28:39,578 --> 00:28:42,214
I haven't even been able to
go into Gordon's office yet.

337
00:28:42,247 --> 00:28:46,718
Everyone wants to get their hands
on his papers and his journals,

338
00:28:46,751 --> 00:28:50,556
and, frankly, it just seems easier
to just shut the world out.

339
00:28:50,589 --> 00:28:53,325
And all everyone wants to
talk about is his work,

340
00:28:53,358 --> 00:28:55,894
as if that's the most
important thing.

341
00:28:55,927 --> 00:29:02,267
It's not about his family or his
life or memories that he created,

342
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:05,204
and it feels like they don't
really care about him.

343
00:29:07,572 --> 00:29:11,677
I mean, he was found dead in his
office with gunshots in the walls,

344
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:13,913
and it's...

345
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,316
Gunshots?

346
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:21,486
Yeah, there's an investigation.

347
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:25,357
I-I thought it was an aneurysm.
The papers said...

348
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:30,262
His office was ransacked, and,
God knows, it's confusing.

349
00:29:30,296 --> 00:29:31,965
Do they know who
could've done that?

350
00:29:31,998 --> 00:29:35,368
He was working with a
lot of troubled people.

351
00:29:35,401 --> 00:29:37,303
I know that he was
having difficulties

352
00:29:37,336 --> 00:29:39,872
with some of the participants
of the research study.

353
00:29:39,905 --> 00:29:41,641
Have they found anything yet?

354
00:29:41,674 --> 00:29:43,643
I think we just had the funeral

355
00:29:43,676 --> 00:29:47,280
for the only person at Cortex
that could find anything.

356
00:29:48,948 --> 00:29:50,617
You think they're
hiding something?

357
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:52,752
There's a part of me that
just thinks I just...

358
00:29:52,785 --> 00:29:57,290
I'm never gonna know the real truth,
and I didn't get to say goodbye.

359
00:30:01,594 --> 00:30:04,931
I just... sorry.

360
00:30:04,964 --> 00:30:08,434
I wish that I could've
been with him.

361
00:30:08,467 --> 00:30:10,437
Oh, God.

362
00:30:12,705 --> 00:30:13,740
Sorry, guh...

363
00:30:13,773 --> 00:30:14,974
It's okay.

364
00:30:15,007 --> 00:30:16,576
So stupid, I...

365
00:30:16,609 --> 00:30:20,813
I completely lost it this
morning because I was trying

366
00:30:20,846 --> 00:30:23,883
to get the coffee machine
to work, and I couldn't...

367
00:30:25,451 --> 00:30:28,688
and Gordon, he just, he
made the best coffee.

368
00:30:28,721 --> 00:30:33,593
You know, have coffee in the
morning, I cry like a baby.

369
00:30:33,626 --> 00:30:38,331
I cry at everything, I do.
Won't stop crying.

370
00:30:42,336 --> 00:30:43,871
Oh...

371
00:30:45,572 --> 00:30:51,612
James, would you mind awfully
telling me the story again?

372
00:30:51,645 --> 00:30:54,982
Oh, uh, sure.

373
00:30:57,918 --> 00:30:59,020
Cheers.

374
00:31:03,123 --> 00:31:05,893
It was a dark and
stormy night...

375
00:31:07,661 --> 00:31:09,096
Thank you, James.

376
00:31:09,129 --> 00:31:12,400
That was unexpected.

377
00:31:14,034 --> 00:31:16,470
I hope you'll visit again.

378
00:31:16,503 --> 00:31:18,339
I'm happy to.

379
00:31:18,372 --> 00:31:19,407
Bye.

380
00:32:17,432 --> 00:32:20,602
Pure, unfiltered truth.

381
00:32:56,171 --> 00:32:59,475
With the technology of
the Rememory machine,

382
00:32:59,508 --> 00:33:04,113
a pure memory is recorded
onto a memory glass

383
00:33:04,146 --> 00:33:06,949
objectively copied
from the brain

384
00:33:06,982 --> 00:33:08,584
and able to be displayed

385
00:33:08,617 --> 00:33:11,120
before the patient
and anyone else.

386
00:33:11,153 --> 00:33:13,622
By re-experiencing the memory,

387
00:33:13,655 --> 00:33:16,692
a catharsis is created
for the patient

388
00:33:16,725 --> 00:33:20,129
that would be impossible to
achieve by simply recalling,

389
00:33:20,162 --> 00:33:22,465
a sort of theater of memory,

390
00:33:22,498 --> 00:33:25,935
in which the patient
becomes audience

391
00:33:25,968 --> 00:33:28,204
to the truth of their lives.

392
00:33:36,645 --> 00:33:40,783
In the recording of a memory,

393
00:33:40,816 --> 00:33:44,520
the role of the psychologist
or therapist is crucial.

394
00:33:44,553 --> 00:33:48,557
The patient must be guided
to the memory to be recorded

395
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:50,626
to activate that
part of the brain,

396
00:33:50,659 --> 00:33:53,262
even if it cannot be
remembered consciously.

397
00:33:53,295 --> 00:33:55,965
The machine has the potential
not only to access,

398
00:33:55,999 --> 00:34:00,103
but also to alter the
brain's synaptic pathways,

399
00:34:00,136 --> 00:34:01,838
so there is the
risk that memories

400
00:34:01,871 --> 00:34:06,042
can be corrupted,
altered, and jumbled.

401
00:34:06,075 --> 00:34:07,777
While it's
theoretically possible

402
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:10,514
to constructively reset or
delete selected memories,

403
00:34:10,547 --> 00:34:13,550
at this time the
risks are unknown.

404
00:35:06,904 --> 00:35:08,273
Happy birth...

405
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:12,210
Sam, honey, come on!

406
00:35:24,154 --> 00:35:25,857
Help me!

407
00:35:47,244 --> 00:35:49,146
Aw, it's good to
be home, brother.

408
00:35:49,179 --> 00:35:51,215
Aw, good to have
you back, brother.

409
00:35:51,248 --> 00:35:52,350
Yeah!

410
00:35:55,853 --> 00:35:57,622
I'm driving.

411
00:35:57,655 --> 00:36:00,124
No, no, no, no, this
is my sweet ride.

412
00:36:00,157 --> 00:36:02,159
Yeah, and I'm driving
your sweet ride.

413
00:36:02,192 --> 00:36:05,329
Okay. You're driving me...

414
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:28,687
Other than the routine
security officers,

415
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,022
janitors, and maintenance crew,

416
00:36:30,055 --> 00:36:32,824
only three people came
into Cortex after 11 p. m.

417
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,726
using limited-access
swipe cards.

418
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:36,294
However, none of them appear

419
00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:38,230
with the device on
any of our cameras.

420
00:36:38,263 --> 00:36:41,299
These two we've identified as
participants in Gordon's trial group,

421
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:43,669
and that... that's Neil.

422
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:46,938
Why would Gordon be meeting trial
group members here so late?

423
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:48,807
Rather out of the ordinary.
- That I don't know.

424
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,776
But they arrived within
minutes of one another,

425
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:52,678
so it could be a
scheduled meeting.

426
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:55,914
Question all staff and crew
members working that night,

427
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:58,050
and then visit all
trial group members.

428
00:36:58,083 --> 00:36:59,818
But be smart about it.

429
00:36:59,851 --> 00:37:01,820
We can't let it get out that
we don't have the machine.

430
00:37:01,853 --> 00:37:05,824
Uh, there's one other thing.

431
00:37:07,492 --> 00:37:09,094
This guy. He never came in,

432
00:37:09,127 --> 00:37:11,930
but he sat in the parking
lot for nearly 25 minutes.

433
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:13,799
Who is he?
- We don't know yet.

434
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:16,435
Find out.

435
00:37:34,754 --> 00:37:37,290
I need to find out what
happened to you, Gordon.

436
00:37:37,323 --> 00:37:40,393
It's the least I can do.

437
00:37:40,426 --> 00:37:43,196
Maybe I can't see your memories,

438
00:37:43,229 --> 00:37:49,436
but I can see the memories of
those near you when you died.

439
00:38:10,823 --> 00:38:13,760
You like staying at
Grandma and Grandpa's?

440
00:38:13,793 --> 00:38:15,128
It's okay.

441
00:38:15,161 --> 00:38:18,798
They love having you.

442
00:38:18,831 --> 00:38:20,900
You're lucky that you
have grandparents

443
00:38:20,933 --> 00:38:22,902
and you're able to see them.

444
00:38:22,936 --> 00:38:25,472
There's lots of kids wish
they still had grandparents.

445
00:38:25,505 --> 00:38:27,508
But I want to stay with you.

446
00:38:29,109 --> 00:38:30,844
Mom.

447
00:38:30,877 --> 00:38:32,012
No.

448
00:38:32,045 --> 00:38:32,980
Mama!

449
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:52,833
Okay, Gordon, let's
meet your group.

450
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,075
Stay with me, come on!

451
00:39:02,108 --> 00:39:05,078
I want to help you get back
to the truth of that event.

452
00:39:05,111 --> 00:39:06,046
Go!

453
00:39:21,962 --> 00:39:25,933
Can you tell me a memory that
fills you with self-hate?

454
00:39:39,547 --> 00:39:43,552
When you keep this secret,
do you feel shame?

455
00:39:53,594 --> 00:39:55,997
Mom? Mommy!

456
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:58,600
Good morning, birthday boy.
Please!

457
00:39:58,633 --> 00:40:01,570
Does thinking of this
always make you so angry?

458
00:40:08,309 --> 00:40:09,510
Do you miss your father?

459
00:40:17,585 --> 00:40:20,488
I can show
you your past.

460
00:40:28,062 --> 00:40:28,997
I understand.

461
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:15,978
It's gonna make his day to
see his Cousin Rafferty.

462
00:41:16,011 --> 00:41:17,479
I hope so.

463
00:41:17,512 --> 00:41:21,216
It's been forever
since I've seen him.

464
00:41:21,249 --> 00:41:24,486
Charles, look who's
here to see you!

465
00:41:25,721 --> 00:41:28,157
These plants, they
kept his brain alive.

466
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:31,226
I swear he remembers all the days
of the week they need watering,

467
00:41:31,259 --> 00:41:33,362
but none of the
other nurses here.

468
00:41:33,395 --> 00:41:34,931
Isn't that right, Charles?

469
00:41:40,202 --> 00:41:43,539
Charles? Cousin Rafferty's
here to see you.

470
00:41:46,009 --> 00:41:47,244
I'll leave you to it.

471
00:41:48,444 --> 00:41:50,513
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

472
00:41:50,546 --> 00:41:52,316
Hugh, is that you?

473
00:41:53,416 --> 00:41:55,986
No... my name is Rafferty.

474
00:41:56,019 --> 00:41:59,389
Charles, do you
remember Gordon Dunn?

475
00:41:59,422 --> 00:42:01,157
The doctor?

476
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:02,659
Do I know you?

477
00:42:09,632 --> 00:42:11,334
You brought it.

478
00:42:11,367 --> 00:42:13,203
Do you want to watch?

479
00:42:14,537 --> 00:42:17,174
Yes, please.

480
00:42:21,044 --> 00:42:22,012
Come on.

481
00:43:07,791 --> 00:43:11,329
Okay, Buster. All right.

482
00:43:26,877 --> 00:43:32,150
My life. That's my life.

483
00:43:35,385 --> 00:43:39,123
Cindy was... was my wife.

484
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:44,228
I was always true to her.

485
00:43:44,261 --> 00:43:47,765
Charles, who are
the other people

486
00:43:47,798 --> 00:43:49,500
in the group working
with Gordon?

487
00:43:49,533 --> 00:43:51,269
I need to find them.

488
00:43:52,803 --> 00:43:56,774
I remember one, a
woman, Allison.

489
00:43:56,808 --> 00:44:00,112
She came here to see
me a few times.

490
00:44:00,145 --> 00:44:01,847
Do you remember her last name?

491
00:44:04,682 --> 00:44:05,884
She never told me.

492
00:44:05,917 --> 00:44:09,521
Just one more question,

493
00:44:09,554 --> 00:44:11,223
if you can remember.

494
00:44:13,158 --> 00:44:14,759
When you were recording
your memories,

495
00:44:14,792 --> 00:44:19,398
what did Gordon tell you about
going back to a specific moment?

496
00:44:23,501 --> 00:44:27,305
It was all about focus...

497
00:44:27,338 --> 00:44:28,373
Focus?

498
00:44:36,314 --> 00:44:41,253
I thought I told you, you
have to let the water drain.

499
00:44:41,286 --> 00:44:44,256
Um, okay.
- I'll look at it myself.

500
00:44:48,826 --> 00:44:50,395
Thank you, Charles.

501
00:45:03,809 --> 00:45:05,345
Let it drain.

502
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:24,830
Yeah, sweets.

503
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:26,465
Good afternoon, Mrs. Dunn.

504
00:45:26,498 --> 00:45:27,466
Good afternoon.

505
00:45:27,499 --> 00:45:30,870
So, we got the results of
the toxicology report.

506
00:45:30,903 --> 00:45:33,873
And?
- Well, there were a few spikes,

507
00:45:33,906 --> 00:45:37,543
but nothing that indicate
anything unusual.

508
00:45:37,576 --> 00:45:39,445
Well, what about the gunshots?

509
00:45:39,478 --> 00:45:41,414
It's still an ongoing
investigation.

510
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:42,949
Now, we're still
running ballistics,

511
00:45:42,982 --> 00:45:45,551
and Cortex is cooperating
with background checks

512
00:45:45,584 --> 00:45:46,886
as well as security footage.

513
00:45:46,919 --> 00:45:48,888
Eh, Lawton came 'round

514
00:45:48,921 --> 00:45:50,823
this morning to reassure me.

515
00:45:50,856 --> 00:45:53,893
I think he just wanted to
get into Gordon's office.

516
00:45:53,926 --> 00:45:57,230
Was everything all right
between you and Gordon?

517
00:45:57,263 --> 00:45:59,499
Mm. Goodbye, Detective.

518
00:46:04,937 --> 00:46:06,372
I'll be in touch.

519
00:46:18,051 --> 00:46:21,388
Allison?
- She's not here.

520
00:46:21,421 --> 00:46:22,322
Can I help you?

521
00:46:22,356 --> 00:46:25,525
Yes, my name is Basil.
I work for Cortex.

522
00:46:25,558 --> 00:46:27,527
She's part of an
experiment group for us,

523
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,696
and it's my job to check
in on the participants

524
00:46:29,729 --> 00:46:32,399
from time to time and make
sure they're doing well.

525
00:46:32,432 --> 00:46:34,534
You work for Cortex?
- Yes, ma'am.

526
00:46:34,567 --> 00:46:35,869
And what is your name?

527
00:46:35,902 --> 00:46:38,372
Basil. Basil Pine.

528
00:46:38,405 --> 00:46:41,275
Well, Basil, if that's the case,

529
00:46:41,308 --> 00:46:43,911
you are truly shit at your job.

530
00:46:45,645 --> 00:46:46,713
I'm sorry?

531
00:46:46,746 --> 00:46:48,415
Allison is dead.

532
00:46:48,448 --> 00:46:50,817
She killed herself
three weeks ago.

533
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:52,886
You didn't know.

534
00:46:55,488 --> 00:46:57,991
I'm sorry.
- Sorry doesn't bring back my sister.

535
00:46:58,024 --> 00:47:00,961
She was too fragile to be part
of your idiotic experiment.

536
00:47:00,994 --> 00:47:03,964
Anyone with half an eye
could've seen that.

537
00:47:03,997 --> 00:47:05,466
I have her memories.

538
00:47:11,738 --> 00:47:15,476
I know about the difficulties
in your past, Allison.

539
00:47:29,457 --> 00:47:31,526
I know the medications
aren't working.

540
00:47:33,694 --> 00:47:34,829
I can help.

541
00:47:34,862 --> 00:47:37,332
Happy birthday, Alli-boo!

542
00:47:40,801 --> 00:47:42,670
This may take a while.

543
00:47:42,703 --> 00:47:44,005
It's a process.

544
00:47:44,038 --> 00:47:46,608
It may get worse
before it gets better.

545
00:47:52,413 --> 00:47:55,650
That birthday, we surprised her.

546
00:47:55,683 --> 00:47:59,020
That was the last time
I saw her truly happy.

547
00:47:59,053 --> 00:48:01,523
Do you think she
blamed the machine?

548
00:48:03,624 --> 00:48:08,363
I think it suffocated
her in her own past.

549
00:48:12,099 --> 00:48:14,769
What's the point
of this, anyway?

550
00:48:14,802 --> 00:48:16,637
Why does the machine exist?

551
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:18,039
I'm not sure, exactly.

552
00:48:18,072 --> 00:48:22,777
But Gordon Dunn believed
that we don't know

553
00:48:22,810 --> 00:48:25,847
the true value of a moment
until it becomes a memory.

554
00:48:25,881 --> 00:48:30,386
Maybe he was trying to get people
to see the value of a moment

555
00:48:30,419 --> 00:48:33,722
before it changes or
gets lost forever.

556
00:48:33,755 --> 00:48:36,892
Well, that's very nice
and flowery, but...

557
00:48:36,925 --> 00:48:39,928
Did anyone from
Cortex contact you?

558
00:48:39,961 --> 00:48:41,764
Gordon, or someone
from his group?

559
00:48:41,797 --> 00:48:46,402
One phone call from
some guy named Robert.

560
00:48:46,435 --> 00:48:48,604
Lawton?
- That's right.

561
00:48:48,637 --> 00:48:52,474
He offered me a check as long
as I didn't talk to anyone.

562
00:48:52,507 --> 00:48:54,443
Did you take it?
- Of course I took it.

563
00:48:54,476 --> 00:48:57,045
Who couldn't use $50.000?

564
00:48:57,078 --> 00:49:00,549
Anyway, you can't fight these corporations.
You never win.

565
00:49:00,582 --> 00:49:01,517
No.

566
00:49:05,887 --> 00:49:08,057
I'm very sorry
about your sister.

567
00:49:11,626 --> 00:49:15,497
You know, there was
another guy came by,

568
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:18,734
a young guy, kind of strange.

569
00:49:18,767 --> 00:49:22,171
He said he was a researcher
from the doctor... Gordon.

570
00:49:22,204 --> 00:49:24,440
What did he want?

571
00:49:24,473 --> 00:49:26,608
To know if Allison
really killed herself.

572
00:49:26,641 --> 00:49:27,843
That was all.

573
00:49:27,876 --> 00:49:29,711
He seemed shocked
when I said yes.

574
00:49:29,744 --> 00:49:30,979
You remember his name?

575
00:49:31,013 --> 00:49:34,117
Neil Frankel.

576
00:49:34,150 --> 00:49:36,186
The valentine.
- What's that?

577
00:49:36,219 --> 00:49:39,722
Nothing, just trying
to remember the name.

578
00:49:39,755 --> 00:49:41,024
Mm.

579
00:49:41,057 --> 00:49:43,626
Well, that's what he said.

580
00:49:43,659 --> 00:49:46,763
But then again, you said
your name was Basil Pine.

585
00:50:44,221 --> 00:50:45,556
Please!

586
00:51:51,990 --> 00:51:53,325
Who are you working for?

587
00:51:53,358 --> 00:51:56,828
An interested party.
Who are you?

588
00:51:56,861 --> 00:51:59,798
I worked with Gordon. I
was a research assistant.

589
00:51:59,831 --> 00:52:00,766
Neil Frankel?

590
00:52:02,634 --> 00:52:03,902
How did you find me?

591
00:52:03,935 --> 00:52:06,071
I remembered your face
from the product launch.

592
00:52:06,104 --> 00:52:07,606
I tracked you down.

593
00:52:07,639 --> 00:52:09,741
Pretty good memory.
- It's photographic.

594
00:52:09,774 --> 00:52:11,977
That's the reason why Gordon wanted
me a part of the test group.

595
00:52:12,010 --> 00:52:14,646
He found it curious.
- What do you want from me?

596
00:52:14,679 --> 00:52:15,781
The machine.

597
00:52:17,048 --> 00:52:18,683
Is it missing?

598
00:52:18,716 --> 00:52:20,752
We need the machine!
- Who's we?

599
00:52:20,785 --> 00:52:23,888
Cortex!
- I don't... I don't have it.

600
00:52:23,921 --> 00:52:26,224
But I can help you find
it if you help me.

601
00:52:27,659 --> 00:52:29,894
How?
- Tell me what led to Allison's suicide.

602
00:52:29,927 --> 00:52:32,097
You're not supposed
to know about that.

603
00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:33,298
There are people
looking for you...

604
00:52:33,331 --> 00:52:34,799
A man has been murdered.

605
00:52:34,832 --> 00:52:36,368
We got bigger things
to worry about.

606
00:52:36,401 --> 00:52:38,103
It was an aneurysm.
- That's what they say,

607
00:52:38,136 --> 00:52:41,006
but if you trusted Lawton we
wouldn't be meeting like this.

608
00:52:41,039 --> 00:52:42,808
Unless this is a set up.

609
00:52:44,142 --> 00:52:45,710
Why did you go see Allison?

610
00:52:45,743 --> 00:52:47,178
I wanted to see if it was true.

611
00:52:47,211 --> 00:52:50,115
About her suicide?
But she'd been dead

612
00:52:50,149 --> 00:52:51,417
for weeks when you got there.

613
00:52:51,450 --> 00:52:53,986
I didn't know that. Not
even Gordon knew...

614
00:52:54,019 --> 00:52:55,254
How could you not know?

615
00:52:55,287 --> 00:52:57,156
Her test phases were over, it...

616
00:52:57,189 --> 00:52:59,058
Lawton didn't want us to know.

617
00:52:59,091 --> 00:53:00,359
He was hiding it.

618
00:53:00,392 --> 00:53:02,695
Yes, could you imagine the
headlines if it got out

619
00:53:02,728 --> 00:53:04,430
that a patient had killed
herself during trials?

620
00:53:04,463 --> 00:53:08,234
That would've been the story. It
would've ended the whole thing.

621
00:53:08,267 --> 00:53:09,769
By the time Gordon found out,

622
00:53:09,802 --> 00:53:11,237
he had no choice but to
continue with the launch.

623
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:13,272
But he didn't know everything.

624
00:53:13,305 --> 00:53:15,341
The research, it's flawed.

625
00:53:15,374 --> 00:53:17,843
Lawton manipulated it.
- Why would they do that?

626
00:53:17,876 --> 00:53:20,680
Because a not so small
percentage of people

627
00:53:20,713 --> 00:53:23,816
were prone to adverse
effects of the machine.

628
00:53:23,849 --> 00:53:24,817
Adverse how?

629
00:53:24,850 --> 00:53:27,687
Explicit and emotional
memories getting confused

630
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:29,088
and playing out in reality,

631
00:53:29,121 --> 00:53:32,425
over-firing of synapses,
hallucinations, time collapse.

632
00:53:34,026 --> 00:53:36,328
Just like Allison.

633
00:53:36,361 --> 00:53:38,264
If Gordon had known,
he would've fixed it,

634
00:53:38,297 --> 00:53:42,968
I don't have a doubt, but he
would've needed time, months,

635
00:53:43,001 --> 00:53:45,237
and that's something
that Lawton didn't have.

636
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:47,440
He made certain promises.

637
00:53:47,473 --> 00:53:50,342
There are issues
to be figured out,

638
00:53:50,375 --> 00:53:53,345
but the machine is incredible.

639
00:53:53,378 --> 00:53:55,682
What it can do for people, it...

640
00:53:57,016 --> 00:54:00,120
Gordon deserves to be
remembered as a genius.

641
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:02,756
I think we're done here.

642
00:54:02,789 --> 00:54:04,958
If you find the machine,
you know where I work.

643
00:54:04,991 --> 00:54:08,729
I'm looking for a young woman
who was part of the test group.

644
00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:12,866
Well, there were two, and
now one of them's dead.

645
00:54:52,172 --> 00:54:55,909
Mom? Mommy?

646
00:54:55,942 --> 00:54:56,977
Please.

647
00:55:03,082 --> 00:55:04,518
I love you.

648
00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:11,960
Gordon.

649
00:55:30,044 --> 00:55:34,149
We've tracked down the group,
but none have the machine.

650
00:55:36,417 --> 00:55:38,853
I was saving this...

651
00:55:41,322 --> 00:55:42,590
for Gordon's return.

652
00:55:42,623 --> 00:55:45,126
I'm sure he would've wanted you

653
00:55:45,159 --> 00:55:46,995
to enjoy it nonetheless.

654
00:55:50,130 --> 00:55:51,566
Do you have any idea

655
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:57,105
the amount of pressure
crushing down on me?

656
00:56:00,541 --> 00:56:01,876
We'll find it.

657
00:56:03,410 --> 00:56:04,846
Yes, you will.

658
00:56:15,257 --> 00:56:17,126
Good morning, birthday boy.

659
00:56:20,929 --> 00:56:21,897
Please.

660
00:56:21,930 --> 00:56:23,332
Does thinking of this

661
00:56:23,365 --> 00:56:25,467
always make you so angry?

662
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:28,170
Wendy, this will help.

663
00:56:32,307 --> 00:56:34,443
So, when you think of it,
do you still feel fear?

664
00:56:35,911 --> 00:56:39,348
Mom?
- Does your heart rate increase?

665
00:56:39,381 --> 00:56:40,883
Mommy!

666
00:56:42,384 --> 00:56:43,586
I understand.

667
00:57:18,154 --> 00:57:20,190
I'll be here if you
have any questions.

668
00:57:29,532 --> 00:57:31,501
It's beautiful, isn't it?

669
00:57:32,368 --> 00:57:33,503
Exquisite.

670
00:57:34,403 --> 00:57:36,172
Reminds me of a memory.

671
00:57:36,205 --> 00:57:38,508
Yeah? Of what?

672
00:57:38,541 --> 00:57:40,443
My father.

673
00:57:40,476 --> 00:57:43,112
He was a real outdoorsman.

674
00:57:43,145 --> 00:57:46,215
Hunting, fishing,
hiking, all of it.

675
00:57:46,248 --> 00:57:48,718
One day, he took my brother
and I out for a hunt.

676
00:57:48,751 --> 00:57:52,588
It was rare that he
took both of us.

677
00:57:52,621 --> 00:57:57,060
We dug a hole in the
mud and waited.

678
00:57:58,127 --> 00:58:00,230
I just wanted to make him proud.

679
00:58:02,131 --> 00:58:06,269
After about an hour,
a rabbit popped up.

680
00:58:06,302 --> 00:58:08,004
I grabbed my gun,

681
00:58:08,037 --> 00:58:11,341
and he went from a quick
hop to a straight drop.

682
00:58:11,374 --> 00:58:15,044
Blood everywhere.

683
00:58:15,077 --> 00:58:18,514
Yeah, kind of wish I
could forget that one.

684
00:58:18,547 --> 00:58:21,384
You have something you
wish you could forget?

685
00:58:21,417 --> 00:58:24,955
Or someone? Gordon Dunn, maybe?

686
00:58:28,291 --> 00:58:29,360
Who are you?

687
00:58:29,393 --> 00:58:31,028
I'm working for his widow.

688
00:58:31,728 --> 00:58:33,965
I know about you and him.

689
00:58:37,534 --> 00:58:40,004
You think he was killed?
- I do.

690
00:58:40,037 --> 00:58:43,340
And I know you saw
him that night.

691
00:58:43,373 --> 00:58:45,142
I know you stole the machine.

692
00:58:45,175 --> 00:58:48,278
I loved him, and he loved me.

693
00:58:48,311 --> 00:58:50,181
Was it over?

694
00:58:52,315 --> 00:58:53,684
It's not my choice.

695
00:58:53,717 --> 00:58:55,686
Is that why you
took the machine?

696
00:58:55,719 --> 00:58:57,287
To get back at him?

697
00:58:57,320 --> 00:59:01,558
While I was working with
Gordon one session,

698
00:59:01,591 --> 00:59:04,728
he... he saw something.

699
00:59:04,761 --> 00:59:08,532
It was nothing incriminating,
it was just this memory

700
00:59:08,565 --> 00:59:11,769
from a few years ago
with the man I loved.

701
00:59:12,736 --> 00:59:13,737
A private moment.

702
00:59:13,770 --> 00:59:15,806
He had no right to even see it.

703
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:17,608
So I wanted it back.

704
00:59:20,077 --> 00:59:23,547
Imagine, to have your memories
watched by other people,

705
00:59:23,580 --> 00:59:25,382
in front of an audience?

706
00:59:25,415 --> 00:59:28,019
It was like my life
wasn't my own anymore.

707
00:59:30,353 --> 00:59:33,090
Every memory became
clouded with Gordon.

708
00:59:34,092 --> 00:59:36,261
But you didn't get them back.

709
00:59:38,162 --> 00:59:39,330
I tried.

710
00:59:39,363 --> 00:59:41,433
I took the machine from Cortex

711
00:59:41,466 --> 00:59:44,669
and I went back to
Gordon's house.

712
00:59:56,214 --> 00:59:58,216
I just wanted to get
my memories back.

713
00:59:58,249 --> 01:00:00,652
I didn't care about the rest.

714
01:00:12,864 --> 01:00:14,699
But then...
- Gordon?

715
01:00:18,536 --> 01:00:19,671
Gordon?

716
01:00:28,146 --> 01:00:29,314
Gordon?

717
01:00:29,347 --> 01:00:31,382
I even tried to go back,

718
01:00:31,415 --> 01:00:32,784
but everything was gone.

719
01:00:32,817 --> 01:00:35,220
I can't move on from this

720
01:00:35,253 --> 01:00:37,689
until I have my memories back.

721
01:00:40,726 --> 01:00:42,829
If you help me find
who killed Gordon...

722
01:00:44,329 --> 01:00:46,499
I'll get them back for you.

723
01:00:50,302 --> 01:00:52,805
If you haven't talked to
Todd yet, you should.

724
01:00:52,838 --> 01:00:54,540
He was furious.

725
01:00:54,573 --> 01:00:56,776
He was there that night?

726
01:00:58,744 --> 01:01:00,779
Gordon was...

727
01:01:00,812 --> 01:01:03,516
he was a brilliant man,

728
01:01:03,549 --> 01:01:05,418
and a truly good man.

729
01:01:07,286 --> 01:01:09,722
I still haven't decided
if his creation was.

730
01:01:10,956 --> 01:01:13,392
Yeah, neither have I.

731
01:01:17,196 --> 01:01:19,232
Why are you doing this?

732
01:01:21,266 --> 01:01:22,535
Resolution.

733
01:01:36,615 --> 01:01:40,319
It has one button. Off and on.

734
01:01:47,393 --> 01:01:49,296
Med school. Oxford.

735
01:01:49,329 --> 01:01:51,398
Specifically, the
woods behind the lab.

736
01:01:51,431 --> 01:01:54,868
Gordon was testing on animals
and I was freeing them,

737
01:01:54,901 --> 01:01:56,770
and he got worried that someone

738
01:01:56,803 --> 01:01:58,872
was busting out the primates,

739
01:01:58,905 --> 01:02:00,540
so he came after me.

740
01:02:00,573 --> 01:02:05,212
He found me in the woods
feeding sandwiches to Pickles.

741
01:02:05,245 --> 01:02:06,180
Pickles?

742
01:02:08,681 --> 01:02:09,783
Pickles the chimp.

743
01:02:09,816 --> 01:02:10,918
Okay.

744
01:02:14,988 --> 01:02:16,556
It was a whole other time.

745
01:02:16,589 --> 01:02:18,491
Funny how life goes, huh?

746
01:02:18,524 --> 01:02:21,595
Years pass, and slowly you
find yourself defined

747
01:02:21,628 --> 01:02:23,463
not so much by the
things that you do,

748
01:02:23,496 --> 01:02:24,898
but the things
that you don't do.

749
01:02:24,931 --> 01:02:27,334
I was gonna learn
French, write a book,

750
01:02:27,367 --> 01:02:31,238
I was gonna have a happy,
huge, sprawling family,

751
01:02:31,271 --> 01:02:33,373
and one by one, I
didn't do those things,

752
01:02:33,406 --> 01:02:35,275
or those things didn't happen.

753
01:02:35,308 --> 01:02:37,411
And I am what is left.

754
01:02:39,412 --> 01:02:43,850
I guess, in part, we're all
remains of unfulfilled dreams.

755
01:02:46,552 --> 01:02:52,259
After Jane died, Gordon wanted
to have another, and I couldn't.

756
01:02:53,927 --> 01:02:56,364
So he threw himself
into his work.

757
01:02:56,397 --> 01:02:59,867
I think he really believed

758
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:02,536
that the machine could
change the past,

759
01:03:02,569 --> 01:03:05,473
and when he realized
that he... it didn't...

760
01:03:05,506 --> 01:03:10,979
he found himself another woman
who didn't remind him of that.

761
01:03:14,014 --> 01:03:15,750
And I still loved him.

762
01:03:15,783 --> 01:03:17,852
I will always love him.

763
01:03:17,885 --> 01:03:21,355
He was brilliant.

764
01:03:21,388 --> 01:03:23,558
And the last thing
that I said to him...

765
01:03:24,591 --> 01:03:25,893
was "You're an asshole."

766
01:03:29,697 --> 01:03:33,468
And I have to live with that
memory and that reality and...

767
01:03:34,935 --> 01:03:38,773
God, it just feels like
there's no ending.

768
01:03:38,806 --> 01:03:41,409
I think there will
be an end to it.

769
01:03:41,442 --> 01:03:43,778
I believe that.

770
01:03:43,811 --> 01:03:48,549
And if we are, as Gordon said,
just the sum of our memories,

771
01:03:48,582 --> 01:03:52,453
I'm really glad to have
made this one with you.

772
01:05:27,016 --> 01:05:32,455
I can't think of a time in my
life when I've been happier.

773
01:05:54,910 --> 01:05:56,479
One left.

774
01:06:03,519 --> 01:06:07,023
TODD

775
01:06:33,683 --> 01:06:35,519
No. No!

776
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:58,776
Excuse me. Hello.

777
01:07:02,112 --> 01:07:03,881
Pickup?
- What?

778
01:07:03,914 --> 01:07:06,550
Do you have a pickup?

779
01:07:06,583 --> 01:07:09,687
Uh, no.
- So, how can I help you?

780
01:07:12,956 --> 01:07:15,226
I wanted to ask you a few
questions about Gordon Dunn.

781
01:07:17,027 --> 01:07:18,729
Get out of here.

782
01:07:18,763 --> 01:07:21,065
Okay. Just a few questions...
- Get out of here.

783
01:07:21,098 --> 01:07:23,034
Just a few quest...
- Get out!

784
01:07:23,067 --> 01:07:24,603
Hey. Ahem.

785
01:07:50,094 --> 01:07:52,597
Sir. Ahem.

786
01:07:54,231 --> 01:07:56,334
How did you know the
combination to the safe?

787
01:07:56,367 --> 01:07:59,571
I-I've seen your memories, Todd.

788
01:08:00,304 --> 01:08:02,841
What do you want from me?

789
01:08:05,276 --> 01:08:06,611
Did you kill Gordon Dunn?

790
01:08:06,644 --> 01:08:08,813
Put it down. Put it down!

791
01:08:08,846 --> 01:08:11,282
I know he was killed, I
know you were fighting,

792
01:08:11,315 --> 01:08:13,184
and I know you were
at Cortex that night.

793
01:08:13,217 --> 01:08:15,019
I didn't kill him. Put it down!

794
01:08:15,052 --> 01:08:16,721
Just... why were you fighting?

795
01:08:16,754 --> 01:08:21,659
Okay. I'll tell you.
I'll tell you.

796
01:08:21,692 --> 01:08:23,562
I'll tell you. Just put it down.

797
01:08:27,065 --> 01:08:29,201
I wanted to kill him.

798
01:08:29,234 --> 01:08:31,870
I really did.

799
01:08:33,372 --> 01:08:35,942
He didn't tell us what
the machine would do.

800
01:08:37,142 --> 01:08:39,144
Not at all.

801
01:08:39,177 --> 01:08:41,780
He didn't tell us it would...

802
01:08:41,813 --> 01:08:45,317
bring back things
that we had buried.

803
01:08:45,350 --> 01:08:49,755
You know, the mind forgets
things for a reason.

804
01:08:49,788 --> 01:08:52,191
You didn't listen!
You never listened!

805
01:08:52,224 --> 01:08:53,759
And now it's too late.

806
01:08:54,793 --> 01:08:55,728
Take it easy.

807
01:08:55,761 --> 01:08:57,630
Calm down, please. Please.

808
01:08:57,663 --> 01:08:59,264
Take it easy. Calm down.

809
01:08:59,297 --> 01:09:00,766
No, you don't want to...

810
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:02,735
Please, don't let this escalate.

811
01:09:02,768 --> 01:09:04,837
No, no. No!

812
01:09:09,207 --> 01:09:10,610
When I woke up...

813
01:09:11,677 --> 01:09:13,613
in the hospital, I had...

814
01:09:14,446 --> 01:09:16,649
I'd forgotten everything.

815
01:09:17,883 --> 01:09:19,918
And then the machine
brought it all back,

816
01:09:19,951 --> 01:09:23,389
and it wouldn't stop
playing in my mind.

817
01:09:23,422 --> 01:09:27,360
Her getting shot over...

818
01:09:28,927 --> 01:09:29,996
and over.

819
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:33,332
I saw it everywhere.

820
01:09:33,366 --> 01:09:35,669
I couldn't turn it off.

821
01:09:36,869 --> 01:09:39,740
It was my fault.

822
01:09:43,109 --> 01:09:45,045
And then I found out...

823
01:09:45,078 --> 01:09:48,081
that Gordon knew about the
shooting the whole time.

824
01:09:48,114 --> 01:09:50,717
He chose you because he knew
what you'd been through.

825
01:09:50,750 --> 01:09:54,220
He ruined my life,
you understand?

826
01:09:54,253 --> 01:09:57,390
I asked him to
delete that memory,

827
01:09:57,423 --> 01:10:01,294
and he wouldn't do it!

828
01:10:01,327 --> 01:10:02,829
He brought back a memory

829
01:10:02,862 --> 01:10:06,032
that my brain had
erased for a reason.

830
01:10:06,065 --> 01:10:11,438
So, yeah, I was there in that
office that night to kill him.

831
01:10:14,307 --> 01:10:16,242
And this time...

832
01:10:16,275 --> 01:10:18,912
I had my finger on the trigger.

833
01:10:21,147 --> 01:10:22,883
And I couldn't do it.

834
01:10:26,419 --> 01:10:30,824
I knew I couldn't live with it.

835
01:10:42,169 --> 01:10:43,104
Prove it.

836
01:11:08,061 --> 01:11:10,030
...tell my life...

837
01:11:10,063 --> 01:11:13,934
Gordon...

838
01:11:13,967 --> 01:11:15,136
Gordon!

839
01:11:20,474 --> 01:11:22,476
Uh, Todd, what are
you doing here?

840
01:11:22,509 --> 01:11:24,445
You fucked up my head!

841
01:11:24,478 --> 01:11:27,181
You came to me injured and hurt.

842
01:11:28,282 --> 01:11:33,454
No. No, you, you came to me.

843
01:11:33,487 --> 01:11:37,792
My life? My life
was better before.

844
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:41,462
Jesus, Todd.

845
01:11:41,495 --> 01:11:43,230
You ruined my life,

846
01:11:43,263 --> 01:11:45,900
and now you're gonna
make a bunch of money?

847
01:11:45,934 --> 01:11:49,104
That's not why.
- You don't give a shit about anyone!

848
01:11:53,174 --> 01:11:54,376
Listen to me.

849
01:11:56,578 --> 01:11:58,380
You know, when I fall,

850
01:11:58,413 --> 01:11:59,981
my eyes roll back,

851
01:12:00,014 --> 01:12:02,484
blood splattered... blood
splattered everywhere...

852
01:12:04,118 --> 01:12:07,923
that's not a memory you want.

853
01:12:10,258 --> 01:12:14,463
It's better than what
you've done to me.

854
01:12:18,399 --> 01:12:20,002
Don't do it, Todd.

855
01:13:00,242 --> 01:13:02,245
She lied to me.

856
01:13:06,682 --> 01:13:08,885
Why would Wendy
want to set you up?

857
01:13:10,286 --> 01:13:14,224
She blamed me for Gordon
breaking it off with her.

858
01:13:15,291 --> 01:13:17,426
Why?

859
01:13:17,459 --> 01:13:19,595
Because when I found
out about them,

860
01:13:19,628 --> 01:13:21,264
I threatened Gordon with it.

861
01:13:21,297 --> 01:13:24,601
Told them I'd tell his
wife if he didn't fix me.

862
01:13:25,668 --> 01:13:27,503
He talked me back,

863
01:13:27,536 --> 01:13:29,538
but right after he
broke up with her.

864
01:13:29,571 --> 01:13:31,307
I need to see what she saw.

865
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:33,042
That's not gonna happen.

866
01:13:33,075 --> 01:13:34,944
She's not going back in there.

867
01:13:34,977 --> 01:13:36,613
I'll get her on the machine.

868
01:13:38,314 --> 01:13:39,949
I wouldn't be so sure.

869
01:13:41,550 --> 01:13:43,920
I have what she wants.

870
01:13:53,996 --> 01:13:57,166
Ah, a brand-new tent, going
camping up at Frost Lake!

871
01:13:57,199 --> 01:13:59,702
Whoo! It's another
five miles to hike,

872
01:13:59,736 --> 01:14:01,338
but it gets us past
all the tourists.

873
01:14:01,371 --> 01:14:03,941
We'll have it to ourselves.
What do you say, brother?

874
01:14:03,974 --> 01:14:05,275
You're not here, Dash.

875
01:14:05,308 --> 01:14:07,477
What are you talking about?
Of course I'm here.

876
01:14:07,510 --> 01:14:10,147
We're going camping, man.
- You're not here.

877
01:14:10,180 --> 01:14:12,549
You're dead.

878
01:14:12,582 --> 01:14:14,551
Dead, what a stupid
thing to say.

879
01:14:14,584 --> 01:14:16,654
Of course I'm here.
I'm not dead.

880
01:14:20,991 --> 01:14:24,428
What... Where you going, man?

881
01:14:24,461 --> 01:14:28,398
What is this? What the...
What the hell is going on?

882
01:14:28,431 --> 01:14:30,267
I'm right here!

883
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:32,169
You're dead, Dash,
and it's my fault.

884
01:14:32,202 --> 01:14:34,237
That doesn't sound like a
brotherly thing to do.

885
01:14:34,270 --> 01:14:35,639
I couldn't let Dad blame
me for your death.

886
01:14:35,672 --> 01:14:37,607
It would only prove him right.

887
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:40,444
I had to ruin your name
not to ruin my life!

888
01:14:40,477 --> 01:14:42,713
You did more than ruin my name.

889
01:14:55,158 --> 01:14:58,395
We found him. He came
to see the old man.

890
01:14:58,428 --> 01:14:59,696
He matches the description,

891
01:14:59,729 --> 01:15:02,499
and the nurses said he was
carrying a briefcase.

892
01:15:02,532 --> 01:15:04,668
Same one Gordon used to bring.

893
01:15:04,701 --> 01:15:06,670
Let me take care of it.

894
01:15:06,704 --> 01:15:08,173
Understood.

895
01:15:15,046 --> 01:15:16,681
James?
- Hi, can I come in?

896
01:15:16,714 --> 01:15:18,183
I need to talk to you.

897
01:15:19,283 --> 01:15:20,218
Are you okay?

898
01:15:21,385 --> 01:15:23,321
James, what's the matter?

899
01:15:25,089 --> 01:15:26,691
I need to tell you something.

900
01:15:26,724 --> 01:15:28,693
I haven't been completely
honest with you.

901
01:15:28,726 --> 01:15:31,062
Why do you have that?
- I took it.

902
01:15:31,095 --> 01:15:34,599
You stole it? That's
Gordon's life's work.

903
01:15:34,632 --> 01:15:37,535
I'm trying to figure out what
happened to him. I'm so close!

904
01:15:37,568 --> 01:15:39,570
This machine, it's...

905
01:15:39,603 --> 01:15:41,206
Who is that?

906
01:15:44,075 --> 01:15:47,111
Oh, it's Lawton.
- Oh, shit.

907
01:15:47,144 --> 01:15:48,713
You can't let him
know that I'm here.

908
01:15:48,746 --> 01:15:50,581
You stole the machine.
Why wouldn't I?

909
01:15:50,614 --> 01:15:52,316
Because I think I know
who killed Gordon,

910
01:15:52,349 --> 01:15:55,086
and Lawton has been lying.
He lied to you, Carolyn...

911
01:15:55,119 --> 01:15:57,022
...and he lied to Gordon.

912
01:15:58,289 --> 01:16:00,025
Please, Carolyn, you
have to believe me.

913
01:16:08,766 --> 01:16:12,370
Robert.
- I need to talk to you, Carolyn.

914
01:16:14,539 --> 01:16:15,775
Come in.

915
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:27,086
Can I get you anything?

916
01:16:27,119 --> 01:16:30,089
No. No, I'm fine, thank you.

917
01:16:31,256 --> 01:16:33,092
How can I help?

918
01:16:33,125 --> 01:16:34,794
There seems to be more
to Gordon's death.

919
01:16:35,827 --> 01:16:38,297
Hmm, in what way?

920
01:16:38,330 --> 01:16:41,767
When I saw him that night
in... in the office,

921
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:44,503
he had the Rememory
machine with him,

922
01:16:44,536 --> 01:16:48,707
but in the morning, and I was
one of the first ones there,

923
01:16:48,740 --> 01:16:51,343
it was gone, his
office ransacked.

924
01:16:51,376 --> 01:16:52,478
Someone took it.

925
01:16:54,846 --> 01:16:57,683
Are you saying someone
killed him for the machine?

926
01:16:57,716 --> 01:16:59,785
It rather would appear so.

927
01:17:01,286 --> 01:17:03,355
Tent's all set up.

928
01:17:03,388 --> 01:17:04,790
Let's start a fire.

929
01:17:07,292 --> 01:17:08,727
Why haven't you told anyone?

930
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:10,462
We need to keep this quiet.

931
01:17:10,495 --> 01:17:13,298
Word cannot get out that
the machine is missing.

932
01:17:13,331 --> 01:17:16,401
Robert, you can't just not tell...
- Carolyn.

933
01:17:16,434 --> 01:17:17,837
I know who did this.

934
01:17:20,473 --> 01:17:23,310
Do you know who this is?

935
01:17:28,714 --> 01:17:31,584
No.
- His name is Samuel Bloom.

936
01:17:31,617 --> 01:17:34,487
No, he doesn't use it much.

937
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:36,556
He has the machine,

938
01:17:36,589 --> 01:17:41,294
and we believe he's the one
responsible for Gordon's death.

939
01:17:41,327 --> 01:17:43,229
If you see him, or
he tries to get

940
01:17:43,262 --> 01:17:44,864
in contact with you in any way,

941
01:17:44,897 --> 01:17:48,434
it's crucial that you let
me know immediately.

942
01:17:48,467 --> 01:17:49,836
As you know, the...

943
01:17:49,869 --> 01:17:52,472
the police have been
useless in this matter...

944
01:17:54,507 --> 01:17:56,343
but Cortex won't be.

945
01:17:57,410 --> 01:17:59,346
Sure.
- Good.

946
01:18:01,714 --> 01:18:05,618
Carolyn, it's important...

947
01:18:05,651 --> 01:18:07,720
that word of this
doesn't get out

948
01:18:07,753 --> 01:18:11,491
for Gordon's work.
- Of course.

949
01:18:11,524 --> 01:18:15,495
I know that he and I have had our
differences in our approach,

950
01:18:15,528 --> 01:18:19,566
but you must know that
I believed in him,

951
01:18:19,599 --> 01:18:23,636
and I only want his
creation to be his legacy.

952
01:18:23,669 --> 01:18:26,272
You want that, don't you?

953
01:18:26,306 --> 01:18:31,212
I would imagine that a man
so obsessed with memory

954
01:18:31,245 --> 01:18:33,647
would want people
to remember him,

955
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:35,416
more than his invention.

956
01:18:36,717 --> 01:18:38,953
Yes, of course.

957
01:18:45,025 --> 01:18:46,794
You know, I would...

958
01:18:48,495 --> 01:18:52,867
I would hate it if I found
out that you were lying.

959
01:18:55,669 --> 01:18:57,438
I think you should leave.

960
01:18:58,905 --> 01:19:00,274
Good evening.

961
01:19:15,422 --> 01:19:18,392
Who are you?
- Carolyn, please.

962
01:19:18,425 --> 01:19:19,893
Tell me, or I'm
calling the police.

963
01:19:19,926 --> 01:19:22,563
I'm sorry I lied to you.
I had to.

964
01:19:22,596 --> 01:19:24,531
Why?
- To help.

965
01:19:24,564 --> 01:19:26,267
By stealing the machine?
What's your name?

966
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:29,470
What's your real name?

967
01:19:29,503 --> 01:19:31,405
Samuel Bloom.
- Did you kill Gordon?

968
01:19:31,438 --> 01:19:34,675
No.
- Did you even know him?

969
01:19:34,709 --> 01:19:36,544
Did you meet at the hotel?

970
01:19:36,577 --> 01:19:39,448
Was any of that true, the
story that you told me?

971
01:19:42,850 --> 01:19:44,553
He told me about Jane.

972
01:19:46,354 --> 01:19:48,490
How he blamed himself, and...

973
01:19:50,358 --> 01:19:51,893
how much he missed her...

974
01:19:53,027 --> 01:19:54,796
that she wanted
to go to Scotland

975
01:19:54,829 --> 01:19:56,831
to see the real castles,

976
01:19:56,864 --> 01:20:01,436
and you were planning
on taking her.

977
01:20:01,469 --> 01:20:03,705
You were going to surprise
her for her tenth birthday.

978
01:20:03,738 --> 01:20:09,444
That he loved you more than
anything, and he just...

979
01:20:09,477 --> 01:20:11,346
He couldn't go on without you,

980
01:20:11,379 --> 01:20:16,017
but there were times when you
reminded him so much of Jane

981
01:20:16,050 --> 01:20:19,321
that he just couldn't bear it,

982
01:20:19,354 --> 01:20:22,023
that he was working on
something revolutionary

983
01:20:22,056 --> 01:20:25,394
that would allow him
to be with her again.

984
01:20:31,733 --> 01:20:33,635
I need your help, Carolyn.

985
01:20:33,668 --> 01:20:38,006
There was a woman, part of
the test group, Wendy Polk.

986
01:20:40,042 --> 01:20:41,377
That's her.

987
01:20:42,077 --> 01:20:43,779
She lied to me.

988
01:20:43,812 --> 01:20:47,350
I know now that she was the last
person to see Gordon alive.

989
01:20:47,383 --> 01:20:49,885
We need to get her
on this machine.

990
01:20:49,918 --> 01:20:52,388
We need to see what she saw.

991
01:20:54,056 --> 01:20:55,958
I'm gonna need your
help to do that.

992
01:21:01,130 --> 01:21:02,932
I want to try it.

993
01:21:23,952 --> 01:21:27,423
You ready?
- Mm. No.

994
01:21:46,008 --> 01:21:47,977
My beauty.

995
01:21:58,721 --> 01:22:02,092
You have made a commitment to me.
- It will free us up.

996
01:22:02,125 --> 01:22:04,895
You have made a
commitment to me.

997
01:22:11,468 --> 01:22:14,004
Can I put the star
on top of the tree?

998
01:22:42,966 --> 01:22:44,067
Look, Mommy!

999
01:22:45,768 --> 01:22:46,737
Beautiful.

1000
01:24:47,292 --> 01:24:49,895
I know you were the
last one who saw him.

1001
01:24:51,162 --> 01:24:53,632
And I know you killed him.
- No.

1002
01:24:55,300 --> 01:24:56,602
I loved him.

1003
01:24:56,635 --> 01:24:58,070
Oh, is that right?

1004
01:24:58,103 --> 01:25:02,174
I hated him the day he died,
but I was in love with him.

1005
01:25:02,207 --> 01:25:05,043
All you were to him
was a distraction.

1006
01:25:05,076 --> 01:25:08,213
I know more than you think.

1007
01:25:08,247 --> 01:25:10,750
I know a part of his
life that you don't.

1008
01:25:11,651 --> 01:25:13,886
I still believed in him.

1009
01:25:13,919 --> 01:25:16,656
I also know memories he had
that you don't know about,

1010
01:25:16,689 --> 01:25:18,224
that he only shared with me.

1011
01:25:18,257 --> 01:25:20,159
I know a whole man you didn't.

1012
01:25:20,192 --> 01:25:23,830
Wow.

1013
01:25:23,863 --> 01:25:26,967
You're quite a confident
little shit, aren't you?

1014
01:25:28,434 --> 01:25:30,703
But he chose you, so...

1015
01:25:30,736 --> 01:25:33,139
We can't even share our stories,

1016
01:25:33,172 --> 01:25:35,942
and now I am left with nothing.

1017
01:25:37,443 --> 01:25:40,179
Well, we're both
left with nothing.

1018
01:25:40,212 --> 01:25:45,318
I just... I want all
this to be over.

1019
01:25:45,351 --> 01:25:47,253
I want my memories back.

1020
01:25:47,286 --> 01:25:50,390
Well, if you want
your memories back...

1021
01:25:51,691 --> 01:25:53,727
I'd like you to do
something for me.

1022
01:26:15,449 --> 01:26:18,852
Gordon? Oh, Jesus Christ!

1023
01:26:24,124 --> 01:26:28,062
Gordon? Gordon, wake up!

1024
01:26:28,095 --> 01:26:29,897
Please wake up!

1025
01:26:29,930 --> 01:26:32,900
Please wake up. Please,
please, please wake up.

1026
01:26:32,933 --> 01:26:33,868
Wake up.

1027
01:26:36,069 --> 01:26:38,706
What have you done?
What did you do?

1028
01:26:39,406 --> 01:26:43,310
Okay.

1029
01:26:44,444 --> 01:26:46,414
Okay. Okay.

1030
01:27:20,915 --> 01:27:23,819
Oh...

1031
01:27:38,499 --> 01:27:40,969
So he was already dead
when you arrived.

1032
01:27:42,970 --> 01:27:44,039
I'm so sorry.

1033
01:27:49,010 --> 01:27:50,412
These are yours.

1034
01:28:05,827 --> 01:28:06,828
Thank you.

1035
01:28:13,501 --> 01:28:15,137
You should have this.

1036
01:28:43,198 --> 01:28:44,400
It's time.

1037
01:29:33,983 --> 01:29:37,087
Ah, it's good to
be home, brother.

1038
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:39,556
It's good to have
you home, Dash.

1039
01:29:41,591 --> 01:29:44,494
No, no, no, no, no.
- What, I'm driving!

1040
01:29:44,527 --> 01:29:46,429
No, no! This is my sweet ride.

1041
01:29:46,462 --> 01:29:48,398
Man, I'm driving
your sweet ride.

1042
01:29:48,431 --> 01:29:49,900
Okay. Okay.

1043
01:29:52,502 --> 01:29:54,404

Okay? You stay here.

1081
01:36:46,988 --> 01:36:49,325
You ruined my life,

and now you're gonna

Jesus, Todd.
- You don't give a shit about anyone!

1084
01:36:55,964 --> 01:36:58,100
Todd, listen to me.

1085
01:36:58,133 --> 01:37:00,869
The moment I fall, and
my eyes roll back,

1086
01:37:00,902 --> 01:37:02,338
blood splattered everywhere,

1087
01:37:02,371 --> 01:37:04,073
you'll have to live with that,

1088

and it'll be worse
than any memory

1089
01:37:06,041 --> 01:37:07,776
that was brought back for you.

1090
01:37:08,877 --> 01:37:10,879
Oh...

1091
01:37:10,912 --> 01:37:16,952
It's better... than
what you've done to me.

1092
01:37:23,793 --> 01:37:24,961
Todd...

1093
01:37:39,876 --> 01:37:41,378
Oh, God.

1094
01:37:42,445 --> 01:37:43,513
Oh, God.

1095
01:37:45,716 --> 01:37:47,085
What have I done?

1096
01:37:47,985 --> 01:37:49,087
What have I done?

1097
01:37:58,495 --> 01:37:59,697
Oh, God.

1098
01:38:33,898 --> 01:38:35,534
Here she comes.
- Here she comes.

1099
01:38:35,567 --> 01:38:36,601
Let's take a picture.

1100
01:38:36,634 --> 01:38:38,637
Is it picture time?
- Get together.

1101
01:38:38,670 --> 01:38:40,705
Okay, we're together,
we're together.

1102
01:38:40,738 --> 01:38:43,442
Say cheese.
- Cheese!

1103
01:38:43,475 --> 01:38:44,543
Perfect.

1104
01:38:44,576 --> 01:38:45,944
Let's go build a sandcastle.

1105
01:38:45,977 --> 01:38:47,112
Build a sandcastle.

1106
01:38:47,145 --> 01:38:48,914
I can't think of a
time in my life

1107
01:38:48,947 --> 01:38:50,949
when I've been happier.

1108
01:38:50,982 --> 01:38:53,018
Carolyn.

1109
01:38:53,985 --> 01:38:55,153
Me neither.

1110
01:38:55,186 --> 01:38:56,988
Everything in its right place.

1111
01:38:57,021 --> 01:38:58,757
Right place.

1112
01:39:13,238 --> 01:39:14,540
...star on top of the tree?

1113
01:39:28,152 --> 01:39:29,855
Cheese!

1114
01:39:30,989 --> 01:39:32,090
Oh, my God!

1115
01:39:37,229 --> 01:39:40,099
Dad, I love you.

1116
01:39:54,680 --> 01:39:58,718
That was a beautiful
day, sweetie.

1117
01:39:59,985 --> 01:40:04,757
It was a beautiful day, but
there were so many days.

1118
01:40:10,162 --> 01:40:13,099
There were so many memories.

1119
01:40:33,719 --> 01:40:34,921
Mm...

1120
01:40:50,203 --> 01:40:53,207
The machine killed him.

1121
01:40:54,274 --> 01:40:57,244
When I met Gordon
at the hotel...

1122
01:40:59,012 --> 01:41:00,648
I knew who he was.

1123
01:41:02,282 --> 01:41:04,752
I wanted to apologize, but...

1124
01:41:05,819 --> 01:41:07,221
there were no words...

1125
01:41:09,222 --> 01:41:11,859
just like there are
no words right now.

1126
01:41:13,226 --> 01:41:16,830
I wanted to tell you
everything, but I-I-I...

1127
01:41:18,632 --> 01:41:19,867
I just, I couldn't.

1128
01:41:26,039 --> 01:41:29,944
If you watch this, you'll
understand who I am...

1129
01:41:31,244 --> 01:41:33,614
who I really am.

1130
01:41:35,348 --> 01:41:37,585
I'm truly sorry, Carolyn.

1131
01:41:38,985 --> 01:41:40,754
I'm so sorry.

1132
01:41:41,888 --> 01:41:43,357
Goodbye.

1133
01:41:44,791 --> 01:41:45,826
Sam...

1134
01:41:48,996 --> 01:41:50,999
Sam, James, Rafferty...

1135
01:41:54,402 --> 01:41:58,807
Whoever you really
are, thank you.

1136
01:43:03,105 --> 01:43:05,774
We define our
lives by our memories.

1137
01:43:05,807 --> 01:43:08,210
Who we are on a particular day

1138
01:43:08,243 --> 01:43:13,482
is the result of memories
from every day before.

1139
01:43:13,515 --> 01:43:19,121
But memories are
elastic, malleable,

1140
01:43:19,154 --> 01:43:21,423
often mercurial things.

1141
01:43:21,456 --> 01:43:24,293
I think of my own life,
the sum of my memories.

1142
01:43:24,326 --> 01:43:29,264
Like any man, I've done many
things that I feel guilt for.

1143
01:43:29,297 --> 01:43:32,034
I feel pain from
so many things...

1144
01:43:34,202 --> 01:43:36,939
for the damndest of things.

1145
01:43:36,972 --> 01:43:40,142
Memories of true happiness are
what make life worth living,

1146
01:43:40,175 --> 01:43:45,781
but they're so often lost
in the sea of bad ones.

1147
01:43:58,226 --> 01:44:01,397
We are nothing more than
the memories we keep...

1148
01:44:05,168 --> 01:44:07,504
memories of overwhelming joy...

1149
01:44:09,806 --> 01:44:11,341
profound sadness...

1150
01:44:14,143 --> 01:44:15,378
gratitude...

1151
01:44:18,181 --> 01:44:19,116
pride...

1152
01:44:22,084 --> 01:44:23,120
grief...

1153
01:44:27,190 --> 01:44:28,425
despair...

1154
01:44:31,527 --> 01:44:32,963
remorse...

1155
01:44:36,399 --> 01:44:37,968
passion...

1156
01:44:40,970 --> 01:44:42,005
regret...

1157
01:44:46,342 --> 01:44:47,477
Regret.

1158
01:45:02,258 --> 01:45:03,527
Regret.

1159
01:45:06,529 --> 01:45:09,365
But the strongest
memories we carry with us

1160
01:45:09,399 --> 01:45:11,402
are ones of love.

1161
01:45:15,038 --> 01:45:16,407
Afternoon, Oliver.

1162
01:45:16,440 --> 01:45:17,542
Afternoon.

1163
01:45:24,615 --> 01:45:25,917
It's Sam.

1164
01:45:28,518 --> 01:45:29,987
My name is Sam.

1165
01:45:31,555 --> 01:45:34,025
Well, then, afternoon, Sam.

1166
01:45:59,917 --> 01:46:04,522
And finally, hope.

1167
01:46:40,291 --> 01:46:42,661
Now, I want you to
think of a memory,

1168
01:46:42,694 --> 01:46:44,963
first thing that comes to mind.

1169
01:46:44,996 --> 01:46:47,232
