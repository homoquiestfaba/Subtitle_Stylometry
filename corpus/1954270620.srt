00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:07,704
but don't leave me
on my fucking side
like this!

358
00:35:07,706 --> 00:35:09,139
All the blood is
rushing to my head

359
00:35:09,141 --> 00:35:10,107
and I'm starting
to get dizzy.

360
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:18,548
Wait! You're not gonna
just leave me like this,
are you?

361
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:20,684
No, you can't
just do that.

362
00:35:20,686 --> 00:35:22,552
When they find me,
my hand will be all blue

363
00:35:22,554 --> 00:35:24,488
and they're probably
gonna have to amputate
my fucking fingers!

365
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,276
Thanks.

366
00:35:46,278 --> 00:35:47,477
Don't mention it.

LONNY: Come on,
you pussies,

368
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:51,848
we gotta get
this bitch back!

369
00:35:58,189 --> 00:36:01,158
What is it?

370
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,660
There's someone out there.
I don't want them to see me.

371
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:12,602
Well, well, well.
Back for a second round.

372
00:36:15,606 --> 00:36:17,507
Hey, you wanna
have some fun?

373
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,848
CHUCK: Can we just go
play ding-dong-ditch
or something?

374
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:26,917
LONNY:
If you pussy out on me,
I'll break you.

375
00:36:26,919 --> 00:36:28,318
CHUCK:
I'm with you, Lonny.

376
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,453
Hey, fuckers!
Hey, you looked.

379
00:36:37,663 --> 00:36:38,695

put that down now.

380

at this whole
serial killer thing, are you?

383
00:37:04,488 --> 00:37:05,589

384

I can't fucking
believe this.

385
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:13,396
This doesn't make sense.
This is crazy.

386
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:15,966
No, it's not.

387
00:37:18,302 --> 00:37:21,238
It's mischief night.

388
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,673
It's the one night
where anything goes.

They get their 364 days

390
00:37:30,449 --> 00:37:34,784
of safety and reliability,
and stability,
and predictability.

391
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:41,258
They've even
co-opted Halloween
with their greeting cards

392
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,893
and UNICEF collections
and cupcakes.

393
00:37:47,865 --> 00:37:48,932
Fuck 'em.

394
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:52,969
Fuck 'em where they live,

395
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:56,539
because this is my night.

396
00:37:56,541 --> 00:37:58,508
It's up for grabs,
and I wanna seize it.

397
00:38:06,517 --> 00:38:10,553
My father always wanted me
to be his good little...

398
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:15,492
His sweet little...

399
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:21,998
In fact, he was
so worried about that,

400
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:26,036
that he never actually
bothered to look at me.

401
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:32,776
He was too busy
fitting in
with the rest of 'em.

402
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,682
And my mother?
Oh, you can forget it.

403
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:44,654
It's all outer smiles
and inner spite.

404
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:50,360
That's what they value.

405
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:52,696
That's who they are.

406
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:58,735
Street after street,
house after house...

407
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:03,473
A world of putrid shit

408
00:39:03,475 --> 00:39:05,775
stinking up my insignificant
little existence.

409
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:18,955
I was always the kid
that talked to strangers

410
00:39:18,957 --> 00:39:21,524
and took candy
from old men.

411
00:39:25,996 --> 00:39:27,630
My name is Kaylie.

412
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,011
Coast is clear.

413
00:39:42,013 --> 00:39:42,946
You can go now.

414
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:47,784
I know.

415
00:39:47,786 --> 00:39:48,918
You wanna finish
what you started?

416
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:53,656
I think we left
off on you wanting

417
00:39:53,658 --> 00:39:55,492
to strangle me
with my intestines.

418
00:39:57,928 --> 00:39:59,829
So what's stopping you?

419
00:40:04,034 --> 00:40:05,869
Let me guess...

420
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:09,539
I'm not like
the other girls.

421
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,176
You're fascinated,

422
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:15,512
intrigued,

423

425

I have to go.

426
00:40:31,195 --> 00:40:33,630
Hey, I got an idea.

427
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:42,605
I don't know
why I'm doing this.

428
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:49,913
Paper.

429
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:52,549
I have to go.

430
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,019
Are you gonna
get me some paper?

431
00:40:58,889 --> 00:40:59,989
Paper.

432
00:40:59,991 --> 00:41:01,791
She wants paper.

433
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:03,026
And I'm actually
getting it.

434
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:11,000
Pen?

435
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,006
A pen.

436
00:41:17,008 --> 00:41:18,608
What good's paper
without a pen?

437
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:23,546
Pen.

438
00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:31,588
First thing we need
is a bag.

439
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:36,593
A big bag.

440
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:49,072
Bag.

441
00:41:49,074 --> 00:41:50,139
Now what?

442
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:54,244
Now, we need to fill it.

You want some M&M's?
Sure.

That's not
candy-coated chocolate.

453
00:44:12,249 --> 00:44:13,683

But they do melt
in your mouth.

457
00:44:25,896 --> 00:44:27,964
Come on.

for this one.

What is it?

469
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:52,115
This is Graham's house.

470
00:45:52,816 --> 00:45:53,516
A friend?

471
00:45:55,986 --> 00:45:57,520
A boy.

472
00:45:57,522 --> 00:45:59,222
Oh, well,
we'll go next door.

00:46:00,824 --> 00:46:01,758

it fit him just perfectly.

My best friend Daphne
thinks he's beautiful.

482
00:46:38,162 --> 00:46:39,362
She said she'd
never date him though,

483
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:43,166
because I saw him first.

484
00:46:48,505 --> 00:46:50,273
I always saw him.

485
00:46:53,043 --> 00:46:54,277
Do you ever talk to him?

486
00:46:55,045 --> 00:46:57,013
Me?

00:46:57,015 --> 00:46:58,447
What would I have to say?

"Hello. I exist."

489

I really do.

Why didn't you
call the cops tonight?

00:47:40,091 --> 00:47:43,159
What, you think
I was really scared
or something?

495
00:47:44,294 --> 00:47:45,361
A little bit.

Do you know
why I sleep easy at night?

497
00:47:49,634 --> 00:47:51,200
Why?

498
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:52,902
Freddy Krueger
doesn't haunt my dreams.

499
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:55,638
I haunt his.

500
00:47:57,574 --> 00:47:58,541
Is that so?

501
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:02,378
Can I ask you
another question?

502
00:48:03,413 --> 00:48:04,413
Maybe.

503

When you jumped
out of the window,

you acted like your knee
snapped backward,

505
00:48:15,092 --> 00:48:17,093
but you've been
walking fine ever since.

506
00:48:18,662 --> 00:48:21,063
Now I ask a question.

507
00:48:21,065 --> 00:48:22,565
You didn't answer
my last question.

508
00:48:22,567 --> 00:48:24,333
You answered it yourself.

509
00:48:25,969 --> 00:48:27,436
Are you having
fun tonight?

510
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:31,240
It's not exactly going
as I planned.

511
00:48:36,213 --> 00:48:38,648
What was your plan?

512
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:41,684
A friendly little game
of hide and seek

513
00:48:41,686 --> 00:48:45,388
capped off with
a little game
of gut the girl?

You know what I like?

518
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:04,173
I like...

00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:08,511
Booze.

520
00:49:11,315 --> 00:49:14,317
The only thing
better than booze
is other people's booze.

521
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:16,719
Would you agree?

522
00:49:16,721 --> 00:49:18,621
Oh, yeah. I'd agree.

538
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,307
Knock knock.

539
00:51:19,843 --> 00:51:21,177
For real.

540
00:51:21,179 --> 00:51:22,745
Okay.

541
00:51:22,747 --> 00:51:23,612
Okay.

542
00:51:24,815 --> 00:51:26,182
Who's there?

543
00:51:30,353 --> 00:51:31,821
Boo.

544
00:51:35,792 --> 00:51:38,594
Yeah, you are good
and shit-faced.

545
00:51:42,332 --> 00:51:43,466
Well, if you're not by now,

546
00:51:43,468 --> 00:51:46,502
then you're some
kind of fucking animal.

547
00:51:47,704 --> 00:51:49,538
Like a machine
or something.

548
00:51:57,681 --> 00:52:00,516
How many times did you
swing that knife
at me and miss?

549
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:06,589
Is your aim
really that bad?

550
00:52:12,395 --> 00:52:15,197
You know what I think?

551
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:19,168
I think the boogeyman
is just like any other man.

552
00:52:20,337 --> 00:52:23,439
He knows what he wants,

553
00:52:23,441 --> 00:52:25,374
he just doesn't
necessarily know
how to get it.

554
00:52:27,244 --> 00:52:30,446
He chases the girl,
he catches her,

555
00:52:32,215 --> 00:52:33,449
but if he kills her,

556
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:37,286
well, that's the end
of it all.

557
00:52:39,556 --> 00:52:40,856
And that's not
what he wants.

558
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:45,194
He wants her.

559
00:52:51,401 --> 00:52:52,601
And then the girl?

560
00:52:53,236 --> 00:52:54,303
Hmm.

561
00:52:55,906 --> 00:52:59,241
The sweet little
virginal girl,

562
00:52:59,243 --> 00:53:03,779
the one...
None of the other boys
are interested in?

563
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:09,552
Until one night

564
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:12,555
this boy comes along,

565
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:15,457
different than
all the rest.

566
00:53:18,328 --> 00:53:19,962
He takes
a different tact with her,

567
00:53:23,733 --> 00:53:25,234
and she likes it.

568
00:53:28,605 --> 00:53:30,372
He may frighten her,

569
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:37,913
but somewhere inside,
she knows that this...

570
00:53:40,317 --> 00:53:41,850
This is right.

571
00:53:45,522 --> 00:53:47,289
They're meant
for each other.

572
00:53:51,995 --> 00:53:56,599
Wouldn't it be something if...
This was just the way it was,

573
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:01,737
every night,

574
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:03,906
bringing hell
to everyone
who has it coming,

575
00:54:03,908 --> 00:54:06,976
which is pretty much
everyone.

576
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:12,548
You could
circle the country.

577
00:54:15,518 --> 00:54:17,586
Mischief night,

578
00:54:19,556 --> 00:54:21,557
every night,

579
00:54:22,292 --> 00:54:23,492
everywhere.

580
00:54:25,729 --> 00:54:28,330
That would be something.

581
00:54:34,337 --> 00:54:36,338
But I wouldn't do it alone.

582
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:45,614
I've always had this
feeling inside of me,

583
00:54:46,883 --> 00:54:48,050
all my life,

584
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:51,754
like an urge or a fever,

585
00:54:54,557 --> 00:54:56,592
but I could never
put a finger on it.

586
00:55:01,564 --> 00:55:03,599
And then one day,

587
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:06,435
one instance,

588
00:55:08,705 --> 00:55:10,406
I was at home

589
00:55:12,776 --> 00:55:15,477
putting my son to bed,

590
00:55:17,347 --> 00:55:20,049
my little baby boy.

591
00:55:23,687 --> 00:55:24,720
Beautiful.

592
00:55:27,557 --> 00:55:31,026
My wife was beside me,

593
00:55:33,063 --> 00:55:34,330
so happy.

594
00:55:37,467 --> 00:55:41,603
My life ahead of me,
so good.

595
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:47,710
And it occurred to me then,

596
00:55:49,946 --> 00:55:51,447
in that moment,

597
00:55:52,048 --> 00:55:55,484
so... Benign

598
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:57,786
and pure,

599
00:55:59,656 --> 00:56:03,525
you could put it
on your walls

600
00:56:03,527 --> 00:56:05,427
next to your Norman Rockwell.

601
00:56:09,999 --> 00:56:13,669
That... That feeling
that I'd had for so long

602
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:18,006
is anger.

603
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:23,379
Why such anger?

604
00:56:25,849 --> 00:56:29,017
How do I rid myself
of this anger?

605
00:56:32,655 --> 00:56:35,557
It was like an angry god
I had to please.

606
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:41,864
Murder.

607
00:56:44,667 --> 00:56:45,701
Yeah.

608
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:48,137
And blood.

609
00:56:49,973 --> 00:56:51,874
An innocent.

610
00:56:55,011 --> 00:56:58,180
How (INHALES) it must feel

611
00:57:03,887 --> 00:57:07,523
to wait and wait

612
00:57:08,825 --> 00:57:10,592
till the time is right,

613
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:16,031
and then drive,

614
00:57:16,033 --> 00:57:18,567
just... Drive.

615

616

The angry god
will lead you.

617

Some highway, some exit,

618
00:57:30,213 --> 00:57:32,614
some town, some house.

619
00:57:34,184 --> 00:57:35,551
You'll know it
when you see it.

620
00:57:38,755 --> 00:57:40,456
Some girl.

621
00:57:46,095 --> 00:57:49,731
You kill her
because you can.

622
00:57:59,742 --> 00:58:04,012
And then... The angry god
will be pleased,

623
00:58:06,249 --> 00:58:08,217
and you will know

624
00:58:08,219 --> 00:58:11,086
what it is to feel satiated.

625
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:17,259

00:58:17,261 --> 00:58:19,895

01:10:37,467 --> 01:10:38,933

723
01:10:38,935 --> 01:10:40,235
Uh, is she there?

724
01:10:40,804 --> 01:10:45,940
Yeah, she's... She's in
the bathroom right now.

725
01:10:45,942 --> 01:10:49,310
Right, okay.
Can you just let her know
that Graham called?

726
01:10:49,812 --> 01:10:51,412
Graham?

727
01:10:51,414 --> 01:10:54,582
Uh, yeah.

728
01:10:54,584 --> 01:10:57,018
Yeah, I can let her know
you called.

729
01:10:57,020 --> 01:11:00,355
<i>Thanks, and tell her</i>
<i>I'm really sorry</i>

730
01:11:00,357 --> 01:11:03,024
<i>it was a stupid prank.</i>

731
01:11:03,026 --> 01:11:04,459
What prank?

732
01:11:04,461 --> 01:11:07,295
Yeah, her friend Daphne
had this stupid idea

733
01:11:07,297 --> 01:11:09,297
of making her think that
her and I were hooking up,

734
01:11:09,299 --> 01:11:10,965
and then Daphne and me
were going to surprise her

735
01:11:10,967 --> 01:11:12,267
because we're
actually not hooking up.

736
01:11:12,269 --> 01:11:13,868

737

I don't know.
It was just stupid, um...

739
01:11:21,444 --> 01:11:23,811
By the way,
have you seen Daphne?
Has she come by?

740

Uh, no.

No, not that I know of.

742
01:11:28,051 --> 01:11:31,653
Yeah, can you tell her
all of that... I'm sorry.

743
01:11:31,655 --> 01:11:33,921
<i>You know, Graham,</i>

744
01:11:33,923 --> 01:11:35,623
I think you
should come over
and tell her yourself.

745
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:40,695
You know what?
I think you are right.

746
01:11:42,364 --> 01:11:44,532
Yeah.

747
01:11:44,534 --> 01:11:46,301
All right,
happy Halloween.

really does
something to you.

You think
you're the only one

757
01:13:11,688 --> 01:13:13,554
who's had that urge
building up inside of you?

758
01:13:15,424 --> 01:13:18,760
That necessity
to lash out?

759
01:13:18,762 --> 01:13:21,562
<i>There's a killer</i>

760

761
01:13:24,601 --> 01:13:28,102
<i>and you were</i>
<i>too big of a pussy</i>
<i>to make it happen.</i>

762
01:13:28,104 --> 01:13:32,707
I only had one teeny-weeny,
little thread of sanity

keeping my sociopathic
tendencies in check

764
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:39,747
when, you know,
it was for
the love of a boy.

765
01:13:41,450 --> 01:13:43,551
I thought me and
you had something.

766
01:13:43,553 --> 01:13:45,686
I thought
we were the same.

767
01:13:45,688 --> 01:13:47,822
It could have been
something...

768
01:13:49,057 --> 01:13:50,525
Beautiful.

01:14:01,136 --> 01:14:03,471

we both got fucked tonight.

(SIGHING) Do you think
she'll be upset we were out
later than planned?

772
01:14:37,106 --> 01:14:38,840
Oh, please,
with what I'm paying her?

773
01:14:38,842 --> 01:14:40,741
She should give me a handy
on the way home.

MR. SMILEY: I warned them.

782
01:15:18,815 --> 01:15:23,684
I told them.
I said, "Lock your doors.
Don't answer the door.

"There's strange things
happening here."

And I warned everyone.

I went to every house
and told them.

786
01:15:30,959 --> 01:15:32,527
Devil's Night.

to the store,
what do I see?

894
01:22:03,686 --> 01:22:06,687
Crazy fucking people.
I don't know about you.

895
01:22:06,689 --> 01:22:08,222
You must do. That's a...

896
01:22:09,357 --> 01:22:10,958
(CAR HONKING)

897
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:13,627
I'm taking this medication.
It's really helping me.

898
01:22:13,629 --> 01:22:17,531
I... I have a clarity.
It's unbelievable.

899
01:22:17,533 --> 01:22:20,534
Good shit, man.
I'm really flying.

900
01:22:20,536 --> 01:22:22,102
I think it's speed
or something.

901
01:22:22,104 --> 01:22:24,972
I can recommend it.
Kaylie, Kaylie, yeah.

902
01:22:24,974 --> 01:22:27,241
Haley and the Comets,
Bill Haley, remember him?

903
01:22:27,243 --> 01:22:29,376
<i>Rock Around the Clock.</i>

904
01:22:29,378 --> 01:22:33,047
Mischief. Mischief.
Sounds exactly
what it is, mischief.

905
01:22:33,049 --> 01:22:37,351
By the way, you know,
take out your notebook,
take this down.

906
01:22:37,353 --> 01:22:39,186
Take this down.
Take this down.

907
01:22:39,188 --> 01:22:40,587
Devil's  <i>Nacht.</i>

908
01:22:40,589 --> 01:22:42,423
It's a foreign thing,
I think European.

909
01:22:42,425 --> 01:22:46,393
Romanian, that's
where Dracula was from.

910
01:22:46,395 --> 01:22:50,230
I gotta take my medication
because, shit, man,
I'm coming down.

911
01:22:50,232 --> 01:22:51,465
This is a bummer.

912
01:22:51,467 --> 01:22:52,700
I'm starting to sweat.

913
01:22:52,702 --> 01:22:55,402
I'm starting to, ooh,
you know, shake a bit.

914
01:22:55,404 --> 01:22:57,137
Some pot roast.
Are you hungry?

915
01:22:57,139 --> 01:22:58,639
I think I was walking
my dog.

916
01:22:58,641 --> 01:23:01,308
Dog's name's Henry.
Cute little dog.

917
01:23:01,310 --> 01:23:02,676
Romanian.
Thank you.

918
01:23:02,678 --> 01:23:05,179
Hey, I'm not finished.
I gotta tell you...

919
01:23:05,181 --> 01:23:06,547
I think I know
who did it.

920
01:23:06,549 --> 01:23:08,282
(LAUGHING)

921
01:23:08,284 --> 01:23:09,483
And I'm not gonna
tell you!
