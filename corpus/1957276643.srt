3
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:09,336
- Timmy!

4
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:19,843
- What?

5
00:02:21,132 --> 00:02:22,215
Are you okay?

6
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,370
- Just a dream.

7
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:28,397
- Okay.

8
00:02:39,836 --> 00:02:40,669
- Becky!

9
00:02:40,669 --> 00:02:42,180
- I'm in a hurry.

10
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,060
- Where did you pick up that nasty habit?

11
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,570
- Timmy does it.

12
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,140
Ma, I don't do it when I sleep over

13
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,680
at other people's houses.

14
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,590
- That's good.
- I gotta go.

15
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,140
- Breakfast!
- I'm in a hurry!

16
00:02:55,356 --> 00:02:57,013
- What's her big rush?

17
00:02:58,650 --> 00:02:59,650
- Senior field trip.

18
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:04,733
Toast?

19
00:03:07,034 --> 00:03:08,580
- What's wrong?

20
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,260
- I dreamed Timmy was here last night.

21
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,850
- Yeah, I miss his calls too,

22
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:15,050
but he's got Carolyn now, okay?

23
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:17,083
- Oh, it wasn't about missing him.

24
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,583
- Faye, talk to me.

25
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:25,950
- It was just an odd dream.

26
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:28,180
It shook me up, that's all.

27
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,257
I'm all right.

28
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,680
- Just call him, you'll feel better.

29
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,690
- I don't even know his number.

30
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,760
Did he tell you where he was staying?

31
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,730
- Just someplace outside Chicago,

32
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,763
wherever the storm damage is the worst.

33
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:42,803
You know what?

34
00:03:42,803 --> 00:03:44,620
I bet you he's in some fleabag motel

35
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,243
that doesn't even have a phone.

36
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:50,293
Well, call Carolyn.

37
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:53,120
- I don't want to bother her.

38
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,223
- Off to slay the dragon.

39
00:03:58,283 --> 00:03:59,123
- Bye.

40
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:22,623
- Hello?

41
00:04:22,623 --> 00:04:24,050
- Carolyn.

42
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,450
- Faye, how are you?

43
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:26,931
- I'm fine.

44
00:04:26,931 --> 00:04:29,680
It's Timmy I'm worried about.

45
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,580
He hasn't called us for weeks.

46
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,890
That's just not like him.

47
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:35,550
Have you heard from him?

48
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,230
- I've been meaning to call you.

49
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,350
I've been upset about him also.

50
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,510
I haven't heard from him
since the day he left town.

51
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,593
- That long ago?

52
00:04:43,705 --> 00:04:45,940
Now I'm really worried.

53
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,320
- Let's not panic.

54
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,153
I mean, it's Timmy.

55
00:04:48,153 --> 00:04:49,990
He's probably just busy

56
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:53,042
and the phone lines are
still down since the storms.

57
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:58,153
Faye? Faye, are you still there?

58
00:05:00,422 --> 00:05:01,255
Faye?

59
00:05:02,905 --> 00:05:07,905
Faye, are you still there?

60
00:05:12,426 --> 00:05:14,473
- Don't forget
that blue ski sweater.

61
00:05:14,473 --> 00:05:17,410
- It's packed, Mom.
Along with my earmuffs.

62
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:18,860
Come on, you can't call me every morning

63
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,640
to check on my wardrobe.

64
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,480
Can she, Dad?

65
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,343
- She just needs a little
time to get used to the idea.

66
00:05:26,157 --> 00:05:28,848
On the other hand, I can't
wait to get rid of you.

67
00:05:28,848 --> 00:05:30,223
- Come on.

68
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:35,530
- You know I think this is
gonna be a wonderful experience.

69
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:40,297
Big city, lots of opportunity,
being out on your own.

70
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,640
I'm your mother. I'm gonna miss you.

71
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:47,520
- It's nice to hear.

72
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,740
Now, both of you get out.

73
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,110
It's still my room and I
need to finish packing.

74
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:52,943
- Get out?

75
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,370
- It's not a slum, Mom. It's great.

76
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,700
You're really gonna like it.

77
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,770
Two guys I met on a day
job helped me move in

78
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:08,050
and, oh!

79
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:10,770
I got a job from that ad I told you

80
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,860
I was putting in the newspaper.

81
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,590
- Oh, that's terrific, honey.

82
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,690
Your dad's gonna be glad to hear all this.

83
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,460
- I'm really glad that you
guys are happy with the house.

84
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,870
I think it's terrific.

85
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:29,430
I'm glad we were able to find something.

86
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,750
Could you stop that for a minute?

87
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,219
- Sorry.

88
00:06:33,219 --> 00:06:34,580
- The leak is fixed.

89
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,910
My man's almost done here,

90
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:37,700
and of course the seller is
gonna pay for the repairs,

91
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,710
so it should be ready by...

92
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,583
Tomorrow.

93
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:44,416
- Excellent.

94
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:45,562
- Great.
- That's great.

95
00:06:45,562 --> 00:06:46,626
Thank you.
- Okay, thanks so much.

96
00:06:46,626 --> 00:06:48,800
- Thank you very much.
- Okay.

97
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,060
And we'll see you guys tomorrow.

98
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,703
- Okay.
- Bye-bye.

99
00:06:56,365 --> 00:07:01,365
- I want to thank you for
going that extra mile for me.

100
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,150
My clients are anal retentive

101
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:08,383
and if everything isn't
perfect, they whine.

102
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,180
What are you grinning at?

103
00:07:18,677 --> 00:07:22,420
- The way you talk, the way you look.

104
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,793
Makes a man smile.

105
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:29,870
Hey, do you want to go for a coffee?

106
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:33,313
Now that I'm finished, now
that I went that extra mile?

107
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,890
- You look like you could
use a cold beer instead.

108
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:03,900
I haven't been to a place this
quaint since college days.

109
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:08,900
So Tim, if you own your own company,

110
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,890
what are you doing a little
patchwork job like mine for?

111
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:14,500
- I don't own my own company.

112
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,230
I fake that in my ad. I'm a subcontractor.

113
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:21,014
I keep myself and two other guys busy.

114
00:08:21,014 --> 00:08:21,853
But I got plans.

115
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,013
One of these days I'm
gonna own my own business.

116
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:28,600
- Initiative. I like that in a man.

117
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,610
- All I need is my contractor's license

118
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,360
and then I'm gonna slay the dragon.

119
00:08:34,724 --> 00:08:38,484
That's what my dad calls it.

120
00:08:44,217 --> 00:08:46,813
You know the real reason
that I took the job?

121
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:53,657
I flipped over your voice on the phone.

122
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,403
Do you know how to dance?

123
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,130
- Closing time.

124
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:43,570
You don't have to go home,
but you can't stay here.

125
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,620
- Her name is Carolyn, Ma,
and I am crazy about her.

126
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,453
- You just met her.

127
00:09:54,453 --> 00:09:56,060
- True, but that's all gonna change.

128
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,870
This time I just have this feeling.

129
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:00,200
- That's what you said
about your last girlfriend.

130
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,140
And the one before that.

131
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,860
And Janet, and Judy before her.

132
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,650
At least Carolyn doesn't start with a J.

133
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:08,180
- Cheap shot, Ma.

134
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,500
Look, she is smart and funny.

135
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,663
She owns her own business, real estate.

136
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,270
- Okay, okay.

137
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:17,100
You convinced me. I give up.

138
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,596
- Did I mention
she's beautiful?

139
00:10:20,596 --> 00:10:21,679
- No, really?

140
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,553
- Hello?

141
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,580
Mother, hi.

142
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,463
No one's here.

143
00:11:24,401 --> 00:11:26,549
No, I'm not out of breath.

144
00:11:26,549 --> 00:11:29,370
Actually, stop.

145
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,233
No, I just got back from jogging.

146
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:33,800
Uh-huh.

147
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,773
My boyfriend, I mean my appointment.

148
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,640
No, I, I didn't say boyfriend, Mom.

149
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:46,203
No, actually I have, um, I have to go.

150
00:11:46,203 --> 00:11:48,010
I have to go to my appointment.

151
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:50,362
Mom, I'm hanging up now.

152
00:11:50,362 --> 00:11:51,683
Goodbye, Mother.

153
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,370
Why is it that the guys I hire

154
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:05,633
never live up to my expectations?

155
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:08,625
- It wouldn't matter who
you had working for you.

156
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,950
You are a compulsive overachiever.

157
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:12,960
- Well, I wish you'd get
your real estate license

158
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,000
and give up this paralegal thing.

159
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,880
- And break my father's heart?

160
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,713
- How is he?

161
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:21,140
- He's losing weight again.

162
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,040
- Jenny.

163
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,193
- Doctors think he's not
in remission anymore.

164
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,180
- I'm sorry.

165
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,510
- Listen. I didn't want
to get all all gloomy.

166
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:33,128
So let's just change the subject.

167
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:33,961
- Okay.

168
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,483
- So how's your mystery man, hm?

169
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,370
So when am I gonna get
to meet this Timmy guy

170
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,920
who's been calling the
office for the past month?

171
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,753
You serious?

172
00:12:46,727 --> 00:12:47,670
Well?

173
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:50,393
- Oh, most of the guys I
date are yuppie narcissists.

174
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,160
But this guy is different.

175
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,713
It's 180 degrees.

176
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,887
He's the rough-hewn romantic type.

177
00:12:58,887 --> 00:13:00,830
His hands are calloused

178
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:02,980
and he has a body that
would make you weep.

179
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,270
- Tim has told me so much about you.

180
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,520
I can't wait to meet you.

181
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,150
Mrs. Dolan?

182
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,710
- Faye. Call me Faye.

183
00:13:14,648 --> 00:13:16,490
- Since you can't come here,

184
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:19,299
I thought I would introduce
myself over the phone,

185
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,870
you know, because that
way when a woman answered

186
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,053
you wouldn't feel so-

187
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:25,120
- Shocked.

188
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,769
- Yeah. I know this is hard.

189
00:13:27,769 --> 00:13:29,180
I mean, my mother feels the same way.

190
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,310
It's too soon, it's too soon.

191
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,400
But it's not like we're getting married.

192
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,760
We're just moving in together.

193
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,820
I mean, don't you think that's better?

194
00:13:46,055 --> 00:13:49,320
- So when you go on a date,
do you go in his pickup truck?

195
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,710
All dressed up?

196
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,914
- Mother, would you tell him to stop?

197
00:13:52,914 --> 00:13:54,839
- All I'm doing is trying
to put two and two together.

198
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:55,672
I mean, if you're embarrassed-

199
00:13:55,672 --> 00:13:57,720
- You know, Kevin, when was the last time

200
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,470
that a woman even looked at you twice?

201
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:01,540
- Stop it, both of you.

202
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,930
Get out of there, you're doing it wrong.

203
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:05,670
And stop picking at the caviar.

204
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:06,660
Kevin's right, you know.

205
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:09,929
I don't understand your
connection with this carpenter.

206
00:14:09,929 --> 00:14:12,110
- It's pheromonal.
- What?

207
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,680
- It's a chemical reaction, Mother.

208
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,210
- Ha ha.

209
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:16,820
- He is not your type.

210
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:17,780
- Well, I've had the other type,

211
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,553
and they're not what
they're cracked up to be.

212
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:22,020
Tim makes me laugh.

213
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,050
And he's kind, and he's handsome,

214
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:26,750
and I don't care if he doesn't wear a tie.

215
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,500
- Methinks she doth protest too much.

216
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,510
- Your father and I did
not send you to college

217
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:33,060
and set you up in business
so that you could regress.

218
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,060
We taught you to set your sights higher.

219
00:14:36,149 --> 00:14:38,027
- What is with you people?

220
00:14:40,867 --> 00:14:42,313
- I'm not supposed to drink.

221
00:14:43,526 --> 00:14:44,393
It's my liver.

222
00:14:46,326 --> 00:14:47,713
You can feel it, here.

223
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:49,733
Hard as a rock.

224
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,630
So of course the missus
puts me on cocktail duty.

225
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,590
Where's the fairness in that, huh?

226
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:58,130
- I guess it's not, sir.

227
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,030
You want me to take over?

228
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,713
- No, no.

229
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,343
Martinis are my specialty.

230
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,620
- Fish?
- Pardon?

231
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,130
- Do you fish?

232
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:10,630
- No.

233
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:11,850
- Golf?

234
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:12,963
- Uh, sorry.

235
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,720
- Well, what do you play?

236
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,070
I don't.

237
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,453
Work keeps me pretty busy.

238
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:25,710
- Donald, Donald, Donald.

239
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:28,063
What is taking those martinis so long?

240
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:30,980
Is he talking your ear off?

241
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:31,813
No.

242
00:15:31,813 --> 00:15:34,440
- Just been chatting about
how much we have in common.

243
00:15:39,277 --> 00:15:41,194
- You've been drinking.

244
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:44,460
Has he been drinking?

245
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:53,420
You've been drinking all along.

246
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,640
- Stop it.

247
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,510
- Like a sneak.

248
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,300
- Not in front of the company, Helen.

249
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,823
- Don't you walk away from me!

250
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,423
I am not through with you!

251
00:16:03,401 --> 00:16:05,171
How dare you!

252
00:16:05,171 --> 00:16:06,970
- Um, maybe we should go.

253
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:09,679
- No, stay. They'll work it out.

254
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:11,790
- Anyway, Mom's making duck.

255
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:12,910
- You have to stay for the duck.

256
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:13,743
- Mm-hm.

257
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,683
What are you thinking?

258
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,333
- Nothing.

259
00:16:28,845 --> 00:16:32,490
- Come on, you're
thinking about something.

260
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:33,323
- Okay.

261
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,233
It's your mother.

262
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,773
She hit him. Don't you think
that's a little extreme?

263
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,962
She lost it. You saw her.

264
00:16:46,962 --> 00:16:48,047
- I don't even know what
you're talking about.

265
00:16:48,047 --> 00:16:49,423
- I know what I saw.

266
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,269
I'm sorry.

267
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:00,603
I don't want to fight.

268
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:02,953
Honey, come on.

269
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,380
- Stay away from me.

270
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,693
- Carolyn, you don't have to just-

271
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:08,560
- I said stop.

272
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,440
- All I am saying is maybe your mother

273
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,280
needs some kind of help, you don't-

274
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,043
- Where do you get off?

275
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,520
- Carolyn!

276
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,668
Hey, don't walk away from me.

277
00:17:19,668 --> 00:17:21,359
Can't you just listen to me for a second?

278
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,839
- Let go.
- Calm down.

279
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:27,839
- Let go!

280
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,543
I'm sorry I hurt you.

281
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:44,483
- I, uh, I made you mad.

282
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:46,630
- I'm not like that.

283
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:49,000
- I know.

284
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:50,776
I know.

285
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,080
- I wanna make it up to you.

286
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,400
- I'm gonna have a shiner
where your ring caught me.

287
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,583
- Now why would you
say something like that

288
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:04,833
after I said I was sorry?

289
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:24,199
You don't understand the
pressure that I'm under.

290
00:18:24,199 --> 00:18:26,920
My family, my business.

291
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,061
The pressure I put on myself.

292
00:18:30,061 --> 00:18:31,470
Sometimes I feel like I'm carrying

293
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:33,470
the weight of the world on my shoulders.

294
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:39,280
And then when you held my hands,

295
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,560
I just, I just felt helpless,

296
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,323
and that's when I lost it.

297
00:18:46,323 --> 00:18:49,163
- Just tell me you love
me and it'll be all right.

298
00:18:52,662 --> 00:18:53,745
- I love you.

299
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,447
- Come on, Tim.

300
00:19:04,447 --> 00:19:05,982
Before it snows, all right?

301
00:19:05,982 --> 00:19:07,899
- All right, all right.

302
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,413
Take it.

303
00:19:22,503 --> 00:19:23,336
What's going on?

304
00:19:23,336 --> 00:19:24,250
- You Timmy Dolan?
- Yeah.

305
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,560
- You won the lottery, man.

306
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,781
Your girlfriend sent this over.

307
00:19:27,781 --> 00:19:29,882
Whether you want it or not, it's paid for.

308
00:19:29,882 --> 00:19:32,253
- All right. Thanks a lot.

309
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,163
- Woo!

310
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,820
- Looks like you're
into a pretty good thing

311
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,160
with this Carolyn, huh?

312
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,260
- Yeah.

313
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,510
- So what's up with the eye, Timmy?

314
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:45,720
How come you haven't told us?

315
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,543
- I've got my own theory,
since he hasn't talked.

316
00:19:47,543 --> 00:19:50,120
- And what's that, Einstein?

317
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,520
- Sex.

318
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,520
I mean, he's gotta be having wild sex

319
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,380
for us to begin this kind of attention.

320
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,440
It happened to me once.

321
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,040
I whacked my head on one of those knobs

322
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,300
on a brass headboard.

323
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,170
- Come on, guys, knock it off.

324
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:01,370
- We were just joking, Timmy.

325
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:03,650
- I'm not paying you guys to be comedians.

326
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:04,604
- That's the problem, Tim.

327
00:20:04,604 --> 00:20:05,570
You're not paying us.

328
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:07,020
- You know, I think he's right.

329
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,090
What's up with our checks?

330
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:09,820
- Don't worry. You guys
are gonna get paid.

331
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,303
Come on, let's finish this up.

332
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:18,080
The contractor I was working for skipped.

333
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,830
I can't find him anywhere.

334
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:22,680
He owes me, and I have to pay my guys.

335
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,853
One of them has a kid.

336
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,219
- I'll talk to your father.

337
00:20:29,219 --> 00:20:32,648
- A short-term loan,
and only if you can afford it.

338
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:36,019
- Honey, why aren't you calling from home?

339
00:20:36,019 --> 00:20:39,137
- I didn't want Carolyn to get worried.

340
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:41,030
- You're a couple now.

341
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:43,950
You're supposed to be able
to discuss things like this.

342
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,170
- I know.

343
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:47,270
She'll think I can't keep my end up.

344
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,873
We've been discussing marriage.

345
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:51,953
- Marriage?

346
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:54,890
Timmy, we haven't even met this girl.

347
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:56,957
- Well then, come up
for the weekend. Visit.

348
00:20:56,957 --> 00:20:58,830
I'd really like that, Mom.

349
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:08,340
Hey Jen, how are you?

350
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,610
- Hey.

351
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:11,253
Carolyn's out showing a house.

352
00:21:15,643 --> 00:21:17,500
What happened to you? Ran into a door?

353
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,950
- As a matter of fact, I did.

354
00:21:20,334 --> 00:21:21,734
- I'm kind of clumsy myself.

355
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:24,850
- So how's your father?

356
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:28,003
- Yeah. Doctors can't do
anything else for him.

357
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:31,910
- Hey, I didn't mean to get you all upset.

358
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:36,544
I, um, bought this for him.

359
00:21:36,544 --> 00:21:38,013
You said he liked classical.

360
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:44,337
It's gonna work out.
You gotta believe, okay?

361
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:47,310
You gotta believe.

362
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:09,312
- You think she's trying
to make a fool of me?

363
00:22:09,312 --> 00:22:10,623
I mean, why'd she ask me to
come if she's gonna do this?

364
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,710
- Well, she's just being Carolyn.

365
00:22:14,623 --> 00:22:15,456
Just networking.

366
00:22:19,462 --> 00:22:21,483
- Who is that guy?

367
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,430
- She's just talking, Timmy.

368
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:29,220
- You didn't answer me.

369
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,420
- He's a mortgage broker.

370
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,390
She's in real estate.

371
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:33,461
They do a lot of business together.

372
00:22:33,461 --> 00:22:35,327
- Looks like more than that.

373
00:22:35,327 --> 00:22:37,023
- He used to be her boyfriend.

374
00:22:41,449 --> 00:22:44,890
- And so, uh, you come
down there to see me.

375
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:45,723
- Can we talk?

376
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:53,377
We have to go now.

377
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,133
- I'm not going anywhere.

378
00:22:55,133 --> 00:22:58,135
- We have to pick up my
parents at the airport.

379
00:22:58,135 --> 00:23:00,973
- I don't have to do anything.

380
00:23:00,973 --> 00:23:02,140
I'll meet you.

381
00:23:13,855 --> 00:23:16,100
- This is lovely.

382
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:16,960
- Let me get that.

383
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,230
- Yeah, thank you.

384
00:23:19,682 --> 00:23:22,980
- I'm so glad we're finally here.

385
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:25,380
- It means a lot to us.

386
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:28,080
- And what you've done
with this place is amazing.

387
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,000
- What I want to know
is how you kept Tim here

388
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,933
from hanging his basketball hoop.

389
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:37,370
- I put on a pot of coffee.

390
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:38,933
Tim knows where everything is.

391
00:23:40,735 --> 00:23:42,990
I'm really sorry, but I have to rush off.

392
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:44,490
I have business at the office.

393
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,273
- This late?

394
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:49,503
- Goodnight.

395
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:58,553
- Um, if you'll excuse me for a minute.

396
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,340
My parents came down to meet you.

397
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:14,440
I told them we were
talking about marriage.

398
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,793
- Whatever. Give me the keys.

399
00:24:19,025 --> 00:24:21,310
- You're going out to meet that guy.

400
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:23,850
- We work together. We
have business together.

401
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:26,050
- Your mom said he's your ex-boyfriend.

402
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:27,282
Is he?

403
00:24:27,282 --> 00:24:29,060
- Give me the keys.

404
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,010
- Talk to me!

405
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:33,942
- Michael?

406
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,093
You better go down there and do something.

407
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:46,961
- Just get away from me!

408
00:24:46,961 --> 00:24:48,502
- What is your problem?

409
00:24:48,502 --> 00:24:50,621
- Timmy! Stop it!

410
00:24:50,621 --> 00:24:52,454
Stop it, son, stop it!

411
00:24:53,514 --> 00:24:55,834
Now what is going on here?

412
00:24:55,834 --> 00:25:00,001
This, this is embarrassing
for your mother and me.

413
00:25:20,892 --> 00:25:21,975
- Sorry, Mom.

414
00:25:23,023 --> 00:25:23,856
- Sorry.

415
00:25:26,805 --> 00:25:27,805
- Goodnight.

416
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:57,550
- It smells awfully good in here.

417
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:58,730
- Where's Dad?

418
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:01,313
- Bacon and eggs, and your
dad's gone for a walk.

419
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:04,920
- No time for breakfast, Ma.

420
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,520
Gotta see a man about some work.

421
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:29,360
- You know, it's none of my business

422
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,810
what you were fighting about.

423
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,650
- We're working it out, Faye.

424
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:38,413
- When you get married,
you make a life commitment.

425
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:40,883
The stakes are higher.

426
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,393
Do you love my son?

427
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,773
- I do, very much.

428
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:52,270
- That's good, because
he deserves to be loved.

429
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:54,530
Sometimes he relies on others too much,

430
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,270
but he's a good man.

431
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,423
He'll find his way.

432
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,313
- You worry about us too much.

433
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:06,870
You know, I wish that my mother
talked about me this way.

434
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:11,716
- Stop it, you'll make me cry.

435
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,043
- You're leaving tomorrow.

436
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:19,210
You know, I'm gonna take you shopping.

437
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:22,980
I know this wild shop that
Becky is just gonna love.

438
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:23,813
- Oh my.

439
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,153
- Thank you.

440
00:27:27,188 --> 00:27:28,605
- You're welcome.

441
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,090
We hope this brings you some luck.

442
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:39,860
- It's gonna get better, Mom. Don't worry.

443
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:40,840
My work is good.

444
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,950
People are gonna see that.

445
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:43,610
- I hate to see you struggling like this.

446
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:44,560
It's not fair.

447
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:48,007
- Mom, come on. Don't spoil your visit.

448
00:27:48,007 --> 00:27:50,840
I want you guys to go away feeling good.

449
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,680
- I know you do.

450
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:56,190
- Okay then, I guess I'll
just shut up.

451
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:58,063
- Hey guys, let's go.

452
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,697
- I'll call you soon as I get something.

453
00:29:02,182 --> 00:29:03,670
It's good, it's good! It's good, yes!

454
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:05,420
Thank you, thank you!

455
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:07,481
Hi, honey.

456
00:29:07,481 --> 00:29:08,898
Come have a seat.

457
00:29:10,357 --> 00:29:11,557
- Didn't you work today?

458
00:29:13,281 --> 00:29:14,281
- We got rained out.

459
00:29:15,574 --> 00:29:17,900
- It drizzled for five minutes.

460
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,360
- Building's slow out there now.

461
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,860
- Is it slow, or it got rained out?

462
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,390
Which one is it?

463
00:29:37,865 --> 00:29:41,198
You could've fixed something for dinner.

464
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:45,293
- Don't be upset.

465
00:29:46,999 --> 00:29:48,339
I'll take you out.

466
00:29:48,339 --> 00:29:49,350
- With what?

467
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:52,237
It looks like I'm gonna have
to push you through your life.

468
00:29:52,237 --> 00:29:53,563
- Oh, very cruel.

469
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,180
- When I met you, I
thought you had ambition.

470
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:58,763
I should have my head examined.

471
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:01,753
- I'll make something, okay?

472
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:05,527
Dammit, I spent all day looking for work.

473
00:30:05,527 --> 00:30:07,439
- I don't wanna
hear any more excuses.

474
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:08,506
- They're not excuses!

475
00:30:08,506 --> 00:30:09,835
- No, you take
money from your parents,

476
00:30:09,835 --> 00:30:11,116
but you're living off me.

477
00:30:11,116 --> 00:30:14,366
I've had it. I want you out of my life.

478
00:30:35,676 --> 00:30:37,603
- You scared the life out of me.

479
00:30:37,603 --> 00:30:38,710
What are you doing here?

480
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:40,463
Why aren't you in Chicago?

481
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,530
- Um, we had a fight.

482
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:45,004
We needed a break.

483
00:30:45,004 --> 00:30:46,960
- Oh, sweetheart, I'm sorry.

484
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,430
- No, it's okay.

485
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:49,829
- You sure? You're all right?

486
00:30:49,829 --> 00:30:51,131
- Yeah.

487
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:54,877
- Don't scare me like that.

488
00:30:54,877 --> 00:30:55,877
- I'm sorry.

489
00:30:58,150 --> 00:30:59,840
- I'll get you some fresh towels.

490
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,820
You have to tell me what happened.

491
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:05,210
- Well, it's not Carolyn's fault.

492
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:07,680
It's mine. I keep screwing up.

493
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,510
She says I don't follow
through on anything.

494
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:12,400
You say the same thing.

495
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,500
And you're both right.

496
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,450
- How'd you get those?
- What?

497
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:24,050
Oh, at work.

498
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:24,883
I fell.

499
00:31:51,933 --> 00:31:53,183
- Hello?

500
00:31:54,275 --> 00:31:57,387
Oh, hi.

501
00:31:57,387 --> 00:31:59,387
Fine. Yeah. Yeah, he is.

502
00:32:00,784 --> 00:32:01,951
Just a minute.

503
00:32:08,364 --> 00:32:09,197
- Hello?

504
00:32:10,694 --> 00:32:12,223
Hey.

505
00:32:39,543 --> 00:32:40,376
- Tim?

506
00:32:44,589 --> 00:32:45,422
Tim?

507
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:03,919
- I was gonna phone you first.

508
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:05,669
- Don't say anything.

509
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:44,630
- And I got the idea watching the news.

510
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:46,500
They had a lot of damage upstate,

511
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,110
and they're gonna need crews for cleanup.

512
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,410
They're paying good money.

513
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,960
- I don't want you to go.

514
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,230
- You want an ambitious husband.

515
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:59,880
I'm gonna show you what I can do.

516
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,830
- You don't need to do this.

517
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:05,210
- My dad's gonna float me a loan

518
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,810
for chainsaws and equipment.

519
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:09,240
I can get Frankie and Dom to go

520
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,413
if I promise 'em the big bucks.

521
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:24,690
And then I just popped the
question and she said yes.

522
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:27,200
Listen, I'm really glad you could come.

523
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,610
It means a lot to Carolyn.

524
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:30,510
She wants us all to be a close family.

525
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:32,573
- Hi!

526
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:36,930
- Hi.
- How are you?

527
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:38,192
- Fine.

528
00:34:38,192 --> 00:34:39,550
- It's good to see you.

529
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:40,400
- Can I get that?

530
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,100
- I know you think we're completely crazy,

531
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,089
but we're doing the right thing.

532
00:34:48,089 --> 00:34:50,200
Just before, I just got upset,

533
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,097
and I'm just completely
in love with your son

534
00:34:52,097 --> 00:34:54,690
and I can't imagine going
through life without him.

535
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:56,340
- Are we all ready?

536
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:58,210
- Yeah.
- Mom, after you.

537
00:34:59,182 --> 00:35:00,182
- Thank you.

538
00:35:03,585 --> 00:35:05,050
- I hope your flight was okay.

539
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:06,500
- Fine.

540
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,551
- Oh, we have so much
to do in so little time.

541
00:35:08,551 --> 00:35:10,440
This afternoon I thought
we'd go to the hall,

542
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,833
and then tomorrow I made an
appointment at the bridal shop.

543
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:17,600
- All this hurry.

544
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,440
Is there something I should know?

545
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,813
- No Mom, she is not pregnant.

546
00:35:45,785 --> 00:35:46,618
- Close your eyes, close your eyes,

547
00:35:46,618 --> 00:35:49,368
close your eyes, close your eyes!

548
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:57,690
- To love.

549
00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:58,789
- Have a bite.

550
00:35:58,789 --> 00:35:59,679
- Oh, no no no,

551
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:01,450
I'll never be able to fit
into my wedding dress.

552
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:02,483
- I'm gonna try.

553
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,730
- Well, I thought I could
keep up with anybody,

554
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:09,610
but you two have worn me out.

555
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:11,210
- Well, we got a lot done today.

556
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,290
You know what I wish?

557
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:16,470
That you could stay here longer with us.

558
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:17,440
- Me too.

559
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,773
It's been terrific fun.

560
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:22,850
- Well, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to the bathroom.

561
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:24,050
I'll be right back.

562
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,380
- Ask me anything.

563
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:34,793
- Have you settled your differences?

564
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,190
Are you fighting?

565
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:39,923
- It's not like that, okay, Mom?

566
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,370
I know we're gonna make it.

567
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:46,513
- You sure look happy.

568
00:36:47,366 --> 00:36:48,199
- We are.

569
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:51,113
I love you, Mom.

570
00:37:14,266 --> 00:37:15,408
- Timmy.

571
00:37:15,408 --> 00:37:17,120
- I was loading up equipment.

572
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,910
I would have changed, except
Carolyn said "Don't be late."

573
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:21,520
- I loved meeting your mother today.

574
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,440
- She likes you too, Mrs. Blair.

575
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,053
- A wedding guest list is
a very important thing.

576
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:34,173
- Who's winning?
- I am.

577
00:37:34,173 --> 00:37:36,590
- Oh, why am I not surprised?

578
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:38,303
You're late.

579
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:41,920
- What is he doing here?

580
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:45,640
- Well, he's Kevin's friend too. Be nice.

581
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,490
- Be nice to him?

582
00:37:47,455 --> 00:37:48,400
I don't get it.

583
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,255
Guest list, wedding, family.

584
00:37:51,255 --> 00:37:52,930
Am I missing something here?

585
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:54,150
- I don't want to talk about this now.

586
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,839
This was supposed to be fun.

587
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:57,113
- Carolyn.
- Don't.

588
00:37:58,090 --> 00:37:58,923
Come on, everybody.

589
00:37:58,923 --> 00:38:01,181
Let's go into the dining room
and we'll start the list.

590
00:38:01,181 --> 00:38:03,514
We'll talk about this later.

591
00:38:15,791 --> 00:38:18,010
- Carolyn, how could you bring him?

592
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:20,351
- Don't you tell me
who I can have in my house.

593
00:38:20,351 --> 00:38:21,858
Who the hell do you think you are?

594
00:38:21,858 --> 00:38:23,039
- I'm the guy you're about to marry!

595
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:24,490
- Oh, so that
just gives you the right

596
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:26,310
to tell me what to do?

597
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:27,977
I'm so sick of this.

598
00:38:33,739 --> 00:38:35,227
- What is your problem?
- I can't stand you!

599
00:38:35,227 --> 00:38:36,144
I hate you!

600
00:38:56,323 --> 00:38:57,156
- Hey.

601
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:02,010
She's not here.

602
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:03,010
- Yeah, I knew that.

603
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,410
Jen, could you do me a favor
and give this to Carolyn?

604
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:09,360
I just got word where emergency
crews are supposed to meet.

605
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:11,280
- She'll be back in any minute.

606
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,960
I'm sure she'd like to see you.

607
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,610
- No, no. That's not a good idea.

608
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:19,720
- You want to talk about it?

609
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:22,130
- Just tell her if she needs to reach me

610
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:24,530
that that's the first
town we'll be stopping in.

611
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:33,200
- What's up?

612
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,173
- Gave my notice.

613
00:39:35,079 --> 00:39:38,573
I don't know how long my
father has, and he needs me.

614
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,570
- I don't think I'll be
back for a while, so.

615
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:46,223
Good luck.

616
00:39:47,831 --> 00:39:48,664
- Thanks.

617
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:14,500
- Let's go! Slow, slow, that's good.

618
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:17,210
Looking good. Watch
that engine over there.

619
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:18,130
Watch it.

620
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:27,120
All right, let's finish this
up and go get some lunch.

621
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:32,743
- So am I gonna see you tonight?

622
00:40:34,031 --> 00:40:35,410
- You swear you're not married?

623
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:37,680
- Oh, you got me confused
with my partner over there.

624
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,280
See, he's the one who's engaged.

625
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:42,793
- Tonight. I'll be at Johnny B's.

626
00:40:43,788 --> 00:40:45,508
- All right.

627
00:41:43,495 --> 00:41:44,973
- Hey, come on inside.

628
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:47,500
She's got a nice girlfriend.

629
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:49,573
- Keep 'em away.

630
00:41:50,703 --> 00:41:51,536
- Aw, come on.

631
00:41:51,536 --> 00:41:52,750
I thought we came out to party.

632
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,970
- I got a problem.

633
00:41:55,970 --> 00:41:57,120
- Yeah. Yeah, you do.

634
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,240
Your problem is since we've been here,

635
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,180
you've been in a funk.

636
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,093
- With Carolyn.

637
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:02,500
- What, cold feet?

638
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,543
- Second thoughts.

639
00:42:05,533 --> 00:42:07,580
- Well, have you tried calling
her since we've been here?

640
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:11,413
- No. We had a knock-down drag-out, man.

641
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,200
I can't take it anymore.

642
00:42:16,244 --> 00:42:20,243
For the first time in my life,
I'm seeing things clearly.

643
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,507
Carolyn has it all.

644
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:29,663
Beauty, brains, personality.

645
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:34,850
Unfortunately, she also has
the temper of a serial killer.

646
00:42:40,311 --> 00:42:41,144
It's over.

647
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,343
I have to tell her.

648
00:42:45,769 --> 00:42:48,602
I'm in the relationship from hell.

649
00:42:53,831 --> 00:42:55,138
- Good luck, man.

650
00:42:55,138 --> 00:42:56,388
- Yeah, thanks.

651
00:43:38,768 --> 00:43:40,360
- Missing persons?

652
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,110
Yeah, okay. Hold on, I'll transfer.

653
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:47,070
- Jack?
- What's up?

654
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:48,828
- You know that woman
who's been calling in

655
00:43:48,828 --> 00:43:51,120
that missing persons report from Hartford?

656
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,280
- Yeah.

657
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,480
- Yeah, well, she isn't
in Hartford anymore.

658
00:43:55,536 --> 00:43:59,395
Mrs. Dolan?

659
00:43:59,395 --> 00:44:01,410
- Hello, Mrs. Dolan.
I'm Detective Jack Maas.

660
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:03,384
- We spoke on the phone, I believe.

661
00:44:03,384 --> 00:44:04,573
I'm here about my son.

662
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:07,840
- You understand, Mrs. Dolan,

663
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:10,710
that it isn't against the law
for an adult to disappear.

664
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:12,280
- Oh, not Timmy.

665
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:14,423
He'd call. He always calls.

666
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:17,360
- You said he was working
the storm cleanup.

667
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,990
Now, the phone lines are still
down in a lot of that area.

668
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,253
- He'd find a way.

669
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,430
- Have you checked with his girlfriend?

670
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:26,040
- She's his fiance.

671
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,350
And as I told you on the phone,

672
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:29,460
she hasn't heard from him either.

673
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:30,700
- Well, think about it, Mrs. Dolan.

674
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:33,230
A young guy, probably got
a pocket full of money,

675
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:35,330
sowing some wild notes before the wedding.

676
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:38,173
- Timmy wouldn't do that.

677
00:44:40,134 --> 00:44:41,920
- Look, there's
not a lot I can do here.

678
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,660
Not without some signs of foul play.

679
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:45,330
Now, I'm sorry you had to make the trip.

680
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:47,673
- You couldn't be more wrong about my son.

681
00:44:53,122 --> 00:44:54,205
That's Timmy.

682
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:15,810
- Faye.

683
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:17,360
- I hope I'm not bothering you.

684
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:19,083
- Come in.

685
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:21,680
When did you get here?

686
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:26,400
- I came to fill out a missing
persons report on Timmy.

687
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,790
You can't do that from out of state.

688
00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:30,680
- Well, where's Michael?

689
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:33,270
- He had to work, and somebody
had to stay with Becky.

690
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:34,896
Oh, Carolyn.

691
00:45:34,896 --> 00:45:38,240
I'm afraid something
really awful has happened.

692
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,960
- Now you're making me nervous.

693
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,490
- The police were no help at all.

694
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:43,070
I don't know what to do.

695
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:45,413
I keep having this dream.

696
00:45:45,413 --> 00:45:47,699
I need to know where he is.

697
00:45:47,699 --> 00:45:49,278
That he's all right.

698
00:45:49,278 --> 00:45:51,680
I need answers.

699
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,667
- He'll show up.

700
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:54,963
We have to believe that.

701
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:57,660
Now, where are your things?

702
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:58,800
- At the hotel.

703
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,780
- Well, we're gonna get
them. You're staying here.

704
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:01,613
- Oh no, I couldn't.

705
00:46:01,613 --> 00:46:04,663
- You're staying here
for as long as you need.

706
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:06,953
- Thank you.

707
00:46:31,655 --> 00:46:32,810
- The body come with that?

708
00:46:32,810 --> 00:46:33,643
- No, sir.

709
00:46:47,847 --> 00:46:49,940
- Did you sleep okay last night?

710
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:51,570
- No.

711
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:53,670
Oh, the bed was fine.

712
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:54,740
Thank you, it's...

713
00:46:55,590 --> 00:46:56,790
I haven't had a good night's sleep

714
00:46:56,790 --> 00:46:58,350
for a couple of weeks now.

715
00:46:58,350 --> 00:46:59,730
- Did you take anything?

716
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:00,563
- No.

717
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:05,490
- What?

718
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:06,903
- Something's different.

719
00:47:08,114 --> 00:47:11,023
- Oh, I changed the furniture.

720
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:15,333
- I thought I was losing my mind.

721
00:47:16,282 --> 00:47:18,410
I didn't even notice it last night.

722
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:21,230
- Well, it was dark. And you were upset.

723
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:22,480
- You got new carpet too.

724
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:26,512
- Oh, they were having
this incredible sale

725
00:47:26,512 --> 00:47:27,993
and I couldn't resist.

726
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:36,113
- So what's your plan?

727
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:39,303
About Timmy?

728
00:47:42,166 --> 00:47:44,890
- Carolyn, what's going on here?

729
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:46,290
You're redecorating?

730
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:49,080
You're going about your
life as if nothing happened?

731
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:51,490
Timmy is missing.

732
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:53,793
You never even reported it to the police.

733
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,313
- This is really hard for me to say.

734
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:07,853
We broke up.

735
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:14,400
You promise me that you won't
hate me for telling you this?

736
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:18,583
Tim got physical with me.

737
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:22,020
We had a fight,

738
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:24,780
and that's when he left
for the storm cleanup.

739
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:27,453
And until you had called,
I thought he had told you.

740
00:48:28,365 --> 00:48:29,783
I was so embarrassed.

741
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:33,210
I just, he left some things here,

742
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:35,700
and I just assumed that
he would come back.

743
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:40,706
I'm sorry.

744
00:48:42,056 --> 00:48:42,889
- Shh.

745
00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:04,030
- You really should have
come to us sooner, Faye.

746
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:05,571
I know that things haven't
always been so great

747
00:49:05,571 --> 00:49:07,780
between our children.
- Mother.

748
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:08,930
I already told her that we fought.

749
00:49:08,930 --> 00:49:10,330
Let's just leave it at that.

750
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:13,940
- Their breakup was...

751
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:15,823
Well, acrimonious.

752
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:20,900
So tell me, Faye.

753
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:23,080
What did you accomplish today?

754
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:24,393
- Unfortunately, nothing.

755
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:27,150
- I had to show houses today.

756
00:49:27,150 --> 00:49:29,083
So she was stuck in the condo.

757
00:49:30,254 --> 00:49:32,856
- Maybe Carolyn could make
a list of Timmy's friends.

758
00:49:32,856 --> 00:49:34,270
You know his friends.

759
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:36,370
- Well, I don't know a lot of them,

760
00:49:36,370 --> 00:49:37,980
but I know some of them.

761
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:39,250
I could do that.

762
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:41,143
- There, you see? A plan.

763
00:49:58,550 --> 00:50:01,253
- Okay. You're gonna need one of these.

764
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:03,960
Do you have your bus schedule?

765
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,160
- Fine.

766
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,770
- I'm sorry that I can't do it.

767
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:10,253
- I understand. Go see your client.

768
00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:14,475
- Um, dinner tonight. Cafe Terminus.

769
00:50:14,475 --> 00:50:15,308
- Okay.

770
00:50:19,086 --> 00:50:20,419
- Seven o'clock?

771
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:29,923
- Excuse me.

772
00:50:29,923 --> 00:50:32,333
Would you know a Dominic Santos?

773
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:38,777
- Hey, Dominic!
- Yo!

774
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,023
- Thanks, Dominic.
- You can call me Dom.

775
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:50,993
Everybody does.

776
00:50:50,993 --> 00:50:52,032
You call me Dominic,

777
00:50:52,032 --> 00:50:54,843
it's like I'm automatically
in trouble with my mom.

778
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:56,480
- Okay, Dom.

779
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:57,730
Sorry to bother you here at work,

780
00:50:57,730 --> 00:51:00,200
but we're at our wits' end.

781
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,160
- Cool. Listen.

782
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:02,537
I like Timmy, but I haven't seen him.

783
00:51:02,537 --> 00:51:04,525
And if I have, I would've told you.

784
00:51:04,525 --> 00:51:07,010
'Cause if it was me, I wouldn't
want my mom all freaked.

785
00:51:07,010 --> 00:51:12,010
- Um, Timmy left town with
some guy to work the storm?

786
00:51:12,810 --> 00:51:14,140
You know anything about that?

787
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:15,053
Who the guy is?

788
00:51:15,970 --> 00:51:18,400
- That'd be, um, Frankie.

789
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,200
Frankie, I don't know his last name.

790
00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:22,823
- Where would I find this Frankie?

791
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:24,840
- You can't.

792
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:32,010
- You know what you said about your mom?

793
00:51:32,010 --> 00:51:33,110
I'm starting to freak.

794
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:37,933
This is the number where I'm staying.

795
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:41,783
Please help me try to find Frankie.

796
00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:45,303
Call me.

797
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:47,760
Thanks, Dom.

798
00:51:58,750 --> 00:51:59,583
- Faye.

799
00:52:02,656 --> 00:52:04,620
I can't sell anything.

800
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:06,513
And another salesman left me today.

801
00:52:08,269 --> 00:52:09,403
I'm sorry.

802
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:12,880
How was your day? Did
you find anything out?

803
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,000
- I took four buses.

804
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,083
I know Chicago better than the drivers.

805
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:20,793
And I only found one of Timmy's friends.

806
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:24,310
- If you send enough
positive energy out there,

807
00:52:24,310 --> 00:52:25,310
it'll happen.

808
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:26,260
I know that.

809
00:52:28,553 --> 00:52:30,470
- When that little son
of a bitch calls me,

810
00:52:30,470 --> 00:52:32,497
I'm gonna give him holy hell.

811
00:52:38,430 --> 00:52:40,580
He would've called me
if he was going away.

812
00:52:43,569 --> 00:52:44,803
We're that close.

813
00:52:49,370 --> 00:52:52,723
- Tim and I used
to play Frisbee over there.

814
00:52:55,506 --> 00:52:57,713
- You said used to, as if Timmy was gone.

815
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:01,980
- I meant used to as in we
used to have a relationship.

816
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,880
- I didn't mean anything. I'm sorry.

817
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:05,713
- It's okay.

818
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:09,337
- What was your last fight about?

819
00:53:09,337 --> 00:53:11,487
- The same fight we
had in the parking lot.

820
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,130
- Did you say he got violent?

821
00:53:16,897 --> 00:53:18,670
- I don't want to talk about this.

822
00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:19,603
- I need to know.

823
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:23,143
- Tim and I were having problems.

824
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:26,110
I started to see my ex-boyfriend.

825
00:53:28,596 --> 00:53:30,543
- While you were still with Timmy?

826
00:53:30,543 --> 00:53:31,376
- I know.

827
00:53:33,214 --> 00:53:34,790
When Tim found out, he got crazy.

828
00:53:34,790 --> 00:53:37,590
Faye, I, you don't want to hear this.

829
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:38,423
- I do.

830
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:42,200
- He pulled my hair and
he tried to put my face

831
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:44,370
down on the burner of the stove.

832
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:45,960
- What are you talking about?

833
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,540
That's not my son.

834
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:13,513
- Yeah?

835
00:54:14,935 --> 00:54:16,713
Hello? Faye?

836
00:54:17,759 --> 00:54:18,853
- I can't sleep.

837
00:54:20,018 --> 00:54:21,730
- How are you holding up?

838
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:23,177
- Okay.

839
00:54:23,177 --> 00:54:25,360
- Any luck at all today?

840
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:29,800
- No. How's Becky? Is she all right?

841
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,800
- Oh yeah, yeah. Becky's fine.

842
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:33,350
And school's fine, work's fine.

843
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,080
What's the trouble, Faye?

844
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:39,623
- I can't sleep.

845
00:54:40,738 --> 00:54:41,877
- Dreams?

846
00:54:41,877 --> 00:54:42,710
- Uh-huh.

847
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:46,030
It's very difficult.

848
00:54:46,030 --> 00:54:50,515
It's about Timmy being violent.

849
00:54:50,515 --> 00:54:54,203
I told the detective that they broke up.

850
00:54:55,973 --> 00:54:58,754
I don't understand why
he hasn't called me.

851
00:54:58,754 --> 00:55:01,024
- Well, maybe
he's just so embarrassed

852
00:55:01,024 --> 00:55:03,774
about what happened with Carolyn.

853
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:06,622
Is she being helpful?

854
00:55:06,622 --> 00:55:08,853
- She's giving me
as much time as she can.

855
00:55:08,853 --> 00:55:10,813
She has a business to run.

856
00:55:22,144 --> 00:55:25,394
- The numbers match on the truck, Faye.

857
00:55:27,804 --> 00:55:29,210
If you're up to it,

858
00:55:29,210 --> 00:55:30,823
I'd like you to come down
to the impoundment yard

859
00:55:30,823 --> 00:55:33,163
and complete the identification for me.

860
00:55:34,850 --> 00:55:36,460
- Oh God.

861
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:39,433
- She's not. I'll go.

862
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:43,690
- No, I, I have to see the truck.

863
00:55:43,690 --> 00:55:45,430
It's the closest I've
been able to get to him

864
00:55:45,430 --> 00:55:46,573
since he disappeared.

865
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:17,060
Why is the paint scraped off?

866
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:19,290
- Same reason the license
tags were removed.

867
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:22,090
Whoever did it was trying to
make it harder to identify.

868
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:25,000
- So what are you telling me?

869
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,750
- Can I be straight with you?

870
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:31,910
Somebody stole it for parts,
the parts would be gone.

871
00:56:31,910 --> 00:56:33,510
Somebody stole it for a joyride,

872
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:36,783
I don't think they'd
bother with paint removal.

873
00:56:40,570 --> 00:56:41,750
- Something happened to Timmy.

874
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:44,253
- Well, I'm not ready to
make that leap yet, Faye.

875
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:47,870
Let's just say your son's
case has got my attention.

876
00:56:47,870 --> 00:56:49,810
- Isn't there anything
more you can tell us?

877
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:50,660
- I'm afraid not.

878
00:56:51,630 --> 00:56:52,630
Of course, we'd know a lot more

879
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:55,200
if it hadn't been sitting in
the water for three weeks.

880
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,470
- What do you do now?

881
00:56:57,810 --> 00:56:59,680
- And finally, an update
on that pickup truck

882
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:03,036
that was recovered from a
shipping channel in Lake Michigan.

883
00:57:03,036 --> 00:57:06,000
The truck has been traced
to a Timothy Dolan,

884
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,020
who has been missing from the
Chicago area for three weeks.

885
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:10,990
Anyone with knowledge of his whereabouts

886
00:57:10,990 --> 00:57:13,440
should contact the police
department immediately.

887
00:57:14,970 --> 00:57:18,623
- I thought it best if we
talked away from Mrs. Dolan.

888
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:23,550
- Well, last time I saw
Tim Dolan, we had a fight.

889
00:57:23,550 --> 00:57:26,655
He left, he said he had
some work clearing trees.

890
00:57:26,655 --> 00:57:29,143
- You going somewhere?

891
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:32,030
- Well, I had to let go of my salesman.

892
00:57:32,030 --> 00:57:33,280
He didn't produce.

893
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:36,110
And my secretary had to
take care of her father.

894
00:57:36,110 --> 00:57:38,250
This place is simply too big for me.

895
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:40,070
- Did Jimmy have any enemies?

896
00:57:40,070 --> 00:57:41,160
- Did?

897
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:42,660
- Did, does, you get the gist.

898
00:57:43,550 --> 00:57:44,455
- No.

899
00:57:44,455 --> 00:57:45,333
I mean, I don't know.

900
00:57:45,333 --> 00:57:47,710
I mean, we traveled in different circles.

901
00:57:47,710 --> 00:57:49,690
I don't know if he had any enemies.

902
00:57:49,690 --> 00:57:51,100
- Drugs?

903
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:53,362
- Alcohol, if you count that.

904
00:57:53,362 --> 00:57:56,490
- Would you have known if he
was doing drugs on the sly?

905
00:57:56,490 --> 00:57:57,410
- What are you implying?

906
00:57:57,410 --> 00:57:59,303
That he had some kind of secret life?

907
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:01,193
- Did or does?

908
00:58:04,181 --> 00:58:05,014
Never mind.

909
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:10,120
Was he ever violent with people?

910
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:13,093
With you?

911
00:58:15,270 --> 00:58:16,520
- Do you get off on this?

912
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:21,153
He beat me.

913
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:11,653
- Where are you?

914
00:59:20,679 --> 00:59:21,632
Hello?

915
00:59:21,632 --> 00:59:22,592
- Carolyn?

916
00:59:22,592 --> 00:59:23,701
- Uh, no, this is-

917
00:59:25,843 --> 00:59:26,676
Hello?

918
00:59:42,022 --> 00:59:43,084
Who is this?

919
00:59:43,084 --> 00:59:45,343
- This is Dom.

920
00:59:45,343 --> 00:59:46,744
Mrs. Dolan?

921
00:59:46,744 --> 00:59:48,483
- Dom, yes.

922
00:59:48,483 --> 00:59:49,793
- You gave me this number
in case I could get in touch

923
00:59:49,793 --> 00:59:52,100
with the guy Timmy went out of town with.

924
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:53,910
- All right, the
only reason I'm talking to you

925
00:59:53,910 --> 00:59:55,463
is because I like Timmy, okay?

926
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:59,070
- Please tell me where he is.

927
00:59:59,070 --> 01:00:00,020
- Beats me.

928
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:02,660
We came back three weeks
ago, and that's all I know.

929
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:04,140
We were supposed to head
out a couple days later,

930
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:06,070
but Timmy never picked me up.

931
01:00:06,070 --> 01:00:07,530
- Three weeks ago?

932
01:00:07,530 --> 01:00:08,490
- Yeah, I know it was around then

933
01:00:08,490 --> 01:00:11,250
because I had to come here
to see my parole officer.

934
01:00:11,250 --> 01:00:13,530
And Timmy was coming back to
break up with his girlfriend.

935
01:00:13,530 --> 01:00:16,310
Said he finally had a plan
to put his life together.

936
01:00:16,310 --> 01:00:17,143
Go figure.

937
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:19,620
- He saw Carolyn?

938
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:21,453
- Well, like I say, he dropped me off.

939
01:00:23,090 --> 01:00:24,240
- Why don't I believe you?

940
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:26,261
- All right, I'll tell you what.

941
01:00:26,261 --> 01:00:27,670
We got a ticket on the way back.

942
01:00:27,670 --> 01:00:29,513
You check it out with the cops, all right?

943
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:34,140
- Carolyn said Timmy was violent with her.

944
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:35,760
Was he?

945
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:38,390
- No, man, it was just the opposite.

946
01:00:38,390 --> 01:00:40,220
Y'see, he told me a lot about her.

947
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:41,890
He always had bruises and stuff.

948
01:00:41,890 --> 01:00:43,150
Hell, I even seen her go off on him

949
01:00:43,150 --> 01:00:44,390
in the parking lot outside.

950
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:46,490
She was punching him
through the car window

951
01:00:46,490 --> 01:00:48,540
and he was just standing there taking it.

952
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,090
- The police should know about this.

953
01:00:52,090 --> 01:00:54,150
Will you come with me?

954
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:55,730
- No, ma'am, I'm sorry.

955
01:00:55,730 --> 01:00:58,549
If my parole officer found that
I violated by leaving town,

956
01:00:58,549 --> 01:00:59,780
I'm back in prison.

957
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:00,613
I'm sorry.

958
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:15,340
- What's going on?

959
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:16,190
- Why did you lie to me

960
01:01:16,190 --> 01:01:18,600
about Timmy coming back three weeks ago?

961
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:19,750
- I didn't.

962
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:20,850
- I talked to Frankie.

963
01:01:22,890 --> 01:01:25,140
He said Timmy came back
to break up with you.

964
01:01:26,717 --> 01:01:27,803
- He's lying.

965
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:34,510
- And did he lie when he said
you were the violent one?

966
01:01:34,510 --> 01:01:35,790
- Frankie is a drug addict

967
01:01:35,790 --> 01:01:37,520
who wouldn't remember three weeks ago

968
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:40,053
any more than he would
remember three minutes ago.

969
01:01:41,850 --> 01:01:42,683
- I believe him.

970
01:01:46,616 --> 01:01:48,403
- Who are you calling? The police?

971
01:01:50,666 --> 01:01:51,983
- I was calling a cab.

972
01:02:08,531 --> 01:02:09,448
- I got it.

973
01:02:11,410 --> 01:02:12,827
The 5th of March.

974
01:02:17,676 --> 01:02:20,380
Mrs. Blair, Mr. Blair, I'm
sorry for the interruption.

975
01:02:20,380 --> 01:02:23,390
It's come to our attention
through a traffic ticket

976
01:02:23,390 --> 01:02:27,183
that Tim Dolan was in
town on the 5th of March.

977
01:02:27,183 --> 01:02:28,780
Did you see him?

978
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:31,870
- No.

979
01:02:31,870 --> 01:02:33,950
- To your knowledge, did
your daughter see him?

980
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:35,490
- No.

981
01:02:35,490 --> 01:02:37,307
Look, Sergeant-
- Detective.

982
01:02:37,307 --> 01:02:39,398
Don't you think it's strange
that Tim would return

983
01:02:39,398 --> 01:02:40,973
and not see your daughter?

984
01:02:42,150 --> 01:02:45,100
- I don't think I like the
innuendo I'm hearing, Detective.

985
01:02:46,420 --> 01:02:47,253
- Excuse me.

986
01:02:52,790 --> 01:02:54,630
- So the morgue search turns up nothing.

987
01:02:54,630 --> 01:02:56,860
The contacts in the
area turned up nothing.

988
01:02:56,860 --> 01:03:00,730
Nobody saw the guy when he
got back, except Frankie.

989
01:03:00,730 --> 01:03:01,900
Try this on.

990
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:03,780
The guy left with Dolan, right?

991
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:06,570
Well, maybe Dolan came
back with a wad of cash

992
01:03:06,570 --> 01:03:08,193
and Frankie the ex-con did him.

993
01:03:09,684 --> 01:03:11,134
- A mind is a terrible thing.

994
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:15,400
- What'd they say?

995
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:18,280
- They were indignant.

996
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:20,160
- I'm sure they were.

997
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:23,163
You remember, you told me if
I thought of anything else?

998
01:03:24,330 --> 01:03:27,683
Well, Carolyn just got some
furniture and a new rug.

999
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:31,470
- Maybe I'm missing something here.

1000
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:35,190
- Detective Grant's desk.

1001
01:03:35,190 --> 01:03:36,670
- But there was nothing
wrong with the old furniture.

1002
01:03:36,670 --> 01:03:37,670
It looked brand new.

1003
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:42,312
- Jack, line two.
- Tell them I'm busy.

1004
01:03:42,312 --> 01:03:44,210
I'll call back.

1005
01:03:44,210 --> 01:03:45,560
- You better take this one.

1006
01:03:51,980 --> 01:03:53,490
- Detective Maas.

1007
01:03:53,490 --> 01:03:56,390
- I may have some
information about Timothy Dolan.

1008
01:04:30,829 --> 01:04:31,662
- Would you mind if we asked you

1009
01:04:31,662 --> 01:04:34,120
a couple more questions, Miss Blair?

1010
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:37,610
- No. I'd love to help
in any way possible.

1011
01:04:41,580 --> 01:04:42,413
Come in.

1012
01:04:50,242 --> 01:04:52,190
- How would you characterize

1013
01:04:52,190 --> 01:04:53,540
your relationship with Tim?

1014
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:57,690
- I told you, we were engaged.

1015
01:04:57,690 --> 01:05:00,450
- Yes, but you also told me
that you hadn't seen him.

1016
01:05:00,450 --> 01:05:02,871
But you see, I have
information that he returned.

1017
01:05:02,871 --> 01:05:04,621
- I also told you that we broke up.

1018
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:09,492
- Miss Blair, were you ever
violent with Tim Dolan?

1019
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:14,713
- No, it was the other way around.

1020
01:05:21,830 --> 01:05:22,813
What's he doing?

1021
01:05:26,220 --> 01:05:27,150
What's he doing?

1022
01:05:27,150 --> 01:05:28,964
- Just looking around, Miss Blair.

1023
01:05:28,964 --> 01:05:30,340
That's all right, isn't it?

1024
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:31,850
- This isn't legal.

1025
01:05:31,850 --> 01:05:32,850
- You invited us in.

1026
01:05:35,540 --> 01:05:39,164
- I really think it's best if you leave.

1027
01:05:39,164 --> 01:05:43,580
- If you want to change your story,

1028
01:05:43,580 --> 01:05:46,363
get something off your chest, my number.

1029
01:05:58,975 --> 01:06:00,320
So what do you got?

1030
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:03,247
- Several spots show traces of blood.

1031
01:06:11,014 --> 01:06:12,640
- Faye, I thought I asked
you to wait downtown.

1032
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:14,690
- What's going on? What did you find out?

1033
01:06:16,070 --> 01:06:18,039
- Let's talk about it downtown, Faye.

1034
01:06:18,039 --> 01:06:20,763
- Why talk downtown? Is Carolyn here?

1035
01:06:22,940 --> 01:06:25,360
- We believe Tammy
was the victim of foul play.

1036
01:06:30,491 --> 01:06:31,908
- She killed him.

1037
01:06:33,662 --> 01:06:36,745
I knew it!

1038
01:07:05,010 --> 01:07:06,702
I've already cried myself out

1039
01:07:06,702 --> 01:07:10,293
and had an episode with my suitcase.

1040
01:07:12,924 --> 01:07:16,220
It's driving me crazy.

1041
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:19,910
Michael, I stayed in the
place where she killed him.

1042
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:21,690
- You don't know that, Faye.

1043
01:07:21,690 --> 01:07:25,070
- The police found
blood in Carolyn's apartment.

1044
01:07:25,070 --> 01:07:28,390
- But it doesn't mean
anything till they test it.

1045
01:07:28,390 --> 01:07:30,720
- Then why wouldn't
they let me go back in?

1046
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:32,830
- I don't know, Faye. I don't know.

1047
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:36,663
This is beginning to look very bad.

1048
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:40,123
- I feel so lost.

1049
01:07:40,980 --> 01:07:41,930
- Son of a bitch, Faye.

1050
01:07:41,930 --> 01:07:43,130
I can't stay down here any longer.

1051
01:07:43,130 --> 01:07:44,430
I'm getting on a plane.

1052
01:07:44,430 --> 01:07:45,960
- Oh, what about Becky?

1053
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:47,077
- Don't worry about Becky.

1054
01:07:47,077 --> 01:07:48,700
I'll have my sister stay with her.

1055
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:50,883
- Soon?
- Yes, soon.

1056
01:07:54,403 --> 01:07:55,320
I love you.

1057
01:08:31,930 --> 01:08:35,210
- I've done my duty. I came forward.

1058
01:08:35,210 --> 01:08:37,343
- We need to hear her incriminate herself.

1059
01:08:39,460 --> 01:08:40,510
Will you wear a wire?

1060
01:08:42,063 --> 01:08:44,470
- I don't want to be around her.

1061
01:08:44,470 --> 01:08:45,810
I think she may be a killer.

1062
01:08:45,810 --> 01:08:47,660
That frightens the hell out of me.

1063
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:50,310
- I need to get Carolyn on
tape for a search warrant.

1064
01:08:51,790 --> 01:08:52,743
Help us out here.

1065
01:08:54,940 --> 01:08:56,040
- Can you force me to?

1066
01:09:17,330 --> 01:09:19,693
- Can I talk to her for a minute, alone?

1067
01:09:36,150 --> 01:09:39,163
You know what I was
thinking about out there?

1068
01:09:41,810 --> 01:09:44,343
For most of my adult life, I've had a son.

1069
01:09:46,350 --> 01:09:48,493
I was 18 when I got married.

1070
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:51,923
You know how old Timmy was?

1071
01:09:53,812 --> 01:09:54,645
- 26.

1072
01:09:59,310 --> 01:10:03,493
- Try to imagine the emptiness I feel.

1073
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:09,793
He was a good boy.

1074
01:10:11,502 --> 01:10:14,950
You know how good he was.

1075
01:10:14,950 --> 01:10:17,433
He told me about your father's illness.

1076
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:22,513
- He died.

1077
01:10:25,590 --> 01:10:27,190
That's why I didn't come sooner.

1078
01:10:30,490 --> 01:10:31,323
- I'm sorry.

1079
01:10:32,220 --> 01:10:34,037
- Timmy brought me presents for him.

1080
01:10:35,930 --> 01:10:39,033
CDs, book ones.

1081
01:10:43,750 --> 01:10:45,643
- You know death now, Jenny.

1082
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:49,233
We both do.

1083
01:10:51,970 --> 01:10:54,033
We both know how final it is.

1084
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:02,193
You think that Carolyn Blair
took Timmy away from us.

1085
01:11:03,220 --> 01:11:04,893
You told the police that much.

1086
01:11:08,230 --> 01:11:13,230
Jenny, if this evil goes unpunished,

1087
01:11:17,990 --> 01:11:20,483
we'll never feel anything but emptiness.

1088
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:26,333
Please.

1089
01:12:01,895 --> 01:12:03,980
- I'd like to arrange a secure phone call

1090
01:12:03,980 --> 01:12:05,973
between you and Carolyn's parents.

1091
01:12:06,860 --> 01:12:09,223
I believe they may have
knowledge of the crime.

1092
01:12:11,750 --> 01:12:12,990
- What else don't I know?

1093
01:12:12,990 --> 01:12:14,830
- Faye, we're working on
a good relationship here.

1094
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:16,200
Let's not spoil it.

1095
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:18,300
Need to know. We agreed.

1096
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:20,893
I think it's time we put some
pressure on these people.

1097
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:28,780
- Mrs. Blair, this is Faye Dolan.

1098
01:12:28,780 --> 01:12:30,830
- Are you doing all right, Faye?

1099
01:12:30,830 --> 01:12:33,620
Carolyn told us that you
and she had a falling out.

1100
01:12:33,620 --> 01:12:34,817
- A falling out?

1101
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:40,593
I can't tell you how
difficult this call is.

1102
01:12:44,050 --> 01:12:46,460
The police think Timmy is dead.

1103
01:12:46,460 --> 01:12:47,293
- Dead?

1104
01:12:48,730 --> 01:12:50,223
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1105
01:12:51,130 --> 01:12:53,780
We'll pray for you. Is there
anything that we can do?

1106
01:12:56,250 --> 01:12:58,493
- They also think Carolyn was involved.

1107
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:02,610
- Of course, that's preposterous.

1108
01:13:08,637 --> 01:13:11,230
- I think she was involved too.

1109
01:13:11,230 --> 01:13:12,980
- I'm sorry that you feel that way.

1110
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:15,123
We'll pray for you.

1111
01:14:05,117 --> 01:14:05,950
- Hi.
- Hi.

1112
01:14:07,350 --> 01:14:08,183
Hi.

1113
01:14:09,550 --> 01:14:11,073
Hi, hi, hi.

1114
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:13,913
Oh, sit.

1115
01:14:15,930 --> 01:14:17,300
The cops have been
calling every relationship

1116
01:14:17,300 --> 01:14:20,292
and every friend that I've ever had.

1117
01:14:20,292 --> 01:14:21,960
The doctor has been prescribing sedatives.

1118
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:22,960
They're not helping.

1119
01:14:25,620 --> 01:14:26,670
I don't deserve this.

1120
01:14:41,582 --> 01:14:43,499
And the worst part was,

1121
01:14:45,203 --> 01:14:48,313
is that I knew whatever
Timmy set his mind to,

1122
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:50,073
he would fail.

1123
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:53,623
Why couldn't I just walk away?

1124
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:01,973
When Tim was good, he was marvelous.

1125
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:04,640
How's that nursery rhyme go?

1126
01:15:06,410 --> 01:15:11,410
And when he was bad, he made
me lose control.

1127
01:15:13,420 --> 01:15:14,253
- Talk to me.

1128
01:15:17,410 --> 01:15:18,360
You'll feel better.

1129
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:20,573
- Can't do that.

1130
01:15:23,420 --> 01:15:24,253
- You can.

1131
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:27,153
Carolyn.

1132
01:15:33,770 --> 01:15:34,870
Tell me what happened.

1133
01:15:36,017 --> 01:15:36,850
Carolyn.

1134
01:15:41,176 --> 01:15:46,176
- Tim had only been gone a week

1135
01:15:46,204 --> 01:15:48,433
when he just showed up one night.

1136
01:16:04,097 --> 01:16:06,626
What are you doing here? You're
supposed to be out working.

1137
01:16:06,626 --> 01:16:08,959
- I came back for my things.

1138
01:16:13,970 --> 01:16:15,250
- You're leaving?

1139
01:16:15,250 --> 01:16:17,910
- Just let me get my things.
I've made up my mind.

1140
01:16:17,910 --> 01:16:19,349
I'm going to do this.

1141
01:16:19,349 --> 01:16:20,750
- Don't you walk away from me!

1142
01:16:20,750 --> 01:16:23,304
What is more important, me or your stuff?

1143
01:16:23,304 --> 01:16:24,400
- Hey!

1144
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:25,630
I don't want to hurt you.

1145
01:16:25,630 --> 01:16:27,390
I don't even know if it will hurt you,

1146
01:16:27,390 --> 01:16:29,467
but I have to take
responsibility for myself.

1147
01:16:29,467 --> 01:16:30,950
- Oh, so you found someone?

1148
01:16:30,950 --> 01:16:32,433
- I didn't find anybody.

1149
01:16:32,433 --> 01:16:34,683
- You lying son of a bitch!

1150
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:42,660
- You need help.

1151
01:16:42,660 --> 01:16:44,423
And it's the kind I can't provide.

1152
01:16:49,270 --> 01:16:51,610
I don't want to fight anymore, Carolyn.

1153
01:16:51,610 --> 01:16:53,160
Ever.

1154
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:54,827
I don't have the energy.

1155
01:17:29,961 --> 01:17:30,794
Why?

1156
01:17:44,471 --> 01:17:46,221
- Mom! Dad!

1157
01:17:48,646 --> 01:17:50,479
Get up! Please get up!

1158
01:17:53,479 --> 01:17:56,229
Open the door!
- What's going on?

1159
01:18:00,503 --> 01:18:04,230
- I didn't mean to do
it. It was an accident.

1160
01:18:04,230 --> 01:18:06,523
You have to do something!
- What's going on?

1161
01:18:06,523 --> 01:18:09,232
You're all white, you're all white.

1162
01:18:09,232 --> 01:18:10,232
- He's dead.

1163
01:18:13,133 --> 01:18:18,083
Tim is dead.

1164
01:18:19,231 --> 01:18:21,020
- Let's get you cleaned up.
We'll see if you're all right.

1165
01:18:21,020 --> 01:18:23,367
Call Kevin, get him over here right now.

1166
01:18:24,532 --> 01:18:26,051
Now!

1167
01:18:43,290 --> 01:18:45,340
- When we got there,

1168
01:18:45,340 --> 01:18:47,190
Tim had crawled into the living room.

1169
01:18:48,410 --> 01:18:50,460
I guess he was trying to reach the phone.

1170
01:19:05,829 --> 01:19:07,412
- He's still alive.

1171
01:19:13,051 --> 01:19:13,884
- No!

1172
01:19:18,679 --> 01:19:22,012
Did this happen the way you said it did?

1173
01:19:30,674 --> 01:19:31,507
- No.

1174
01:19:35,549 --> 01:19:36,507
Helen?

1175
01:19:36,507 --> 01:19:39,174
- Do you want her to go to jail?

1176
01:19:46,220 --> 01:19:49,913
- My parents have a
house on Lake Michigan.

1177
01:19:49,913 --> 01:19:51,830
They keep a boat there.

1178
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:31,493
They took him out of sight
of land, and dumped him.

1179
01:20:35,255 --> 01:20:37,558
- Carolyn.

1180
01:20:37,558 --> 01:20:40,808
His worst sin was that he let you down.

1181
01:21:28,270 --> 01:21:29,133
- Ma'am, you're not allowed in here.

1182
01:21:29,133 --> 01:21:30,500
- This is my house.

1183
01:21:30,500 --> 01:21:31,850
- We have a search warrant.

1184
01:21:40,284 --> 01:21:41,860
- Would you tear up the carpet?

1185
01:21:41,860 --> 01:21:44,823
I want a test done for blood
in the kitchen, on that wall.

1186
01:22:05,230 --> 01:22:06,836
- If I back you up all the way,

1187
01:22:06,836 --> 01:22:08,383
would you cut me some slack on this one?

1188
01:22:13,070 --> 01:22:14,030
Faye and Michael Dolan.

1189
01:22:14,030 --> 01:22:15,710
I'd like to introduce Paul Blackwell

1190
01:22:15,710 --> 01:22:17,810
with the state attorney's office.

1191
01:22:17,810 --> 01:22:18,643
- Right.

1192
01:22:20,568 --> 01:22:22,930
- Detective Maas should have told you.

1193
01:22:22,930 --> 01:22:25,163
We don't have a body,
we don't have a case.

1194
01:22:26,310 --> 01:22:28,090
Matter of fact, we don't
even have a weapon.

1195
01:22:28,090 --> 01:22:31,590
- What we do have is Carolyn
on tape, in her own words.

1196
01:22:31,590 --> 01:22:32,990
We can prove Timmy was in town

1197
01:22:32,990 --> 01:22:34,650
because of the traffic ticket he got.

1198
01:22:34,650 --> 01:22:37,320
The blood in the condo is his, no doubt.

1199
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:38,610
- He lived there, he could've cut himself.

1200
01:22:38,610 --> 01:22:40,760
- Oh, that's a load of
bull and you know it.

1201
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:42,860
- Well, that's gonna be her
defense and you know it.

1202
01:22:42,860 --> 01:22:43,910
- Translation?

1203
01:22:43,910 --> 01:22:45,900
It doesn't look good on
their win-loss record

1204
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:47,170
come election time.

1205
01:22:47,170 --> 01:22:50,250
- Jurors in this county don't
give out guilty verdicts

1206
01:22:50,250 --> 01:22:51,330
without hard evidence.

1207
01:22:51,330 --> 01:22:53,030
- Well, what he's trying to tell you is

1208
01:22:53,030 --> 01:22:54,940
that his office has had, what,

1209
01:22:54,940 --> 01:22:57,300
one murder conviction on
circumstantial evidence

1210
01:22:57,300 --> 01:22:59,220
in the past two years?

1211
01:22:59,220 --> 01:23:00,212
- Fine, since you brought it up,

1212
01:23:00,212 --> 01:23:04,003
what happens if a body does
show up after she's acquitted?

1213
01:23:05,830 --> 01:23:06,663
She skates.

1214
01:23:06,663 --> 01:23:08,170
- Let the grand jury decide that.

1215
01:23:08,170 --> 01:23:10,033
- That body has a name.

1216
01:23:10,890 --> 01:23:12,483
Timothy Michael Dolan.

1217
01:23:14,790 --> 01:23:15,623
- Of course.

1218
01:23:18,136 --> 01:23:20,632
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1219
01:23:20,632 --> 01:23:21,573
- Excuse me.

1220
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:26,440
I don't know anything
about rules of evidence,

1221
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:29,790
as you call them, but I do know one thing.

1222
01:23:29,790 --> 01:23:32,113
This is as close as we're ever gonna get.

1223
01:23:32,990 --> 01:23:36,073
- Mrs. Dolan, do you understand
what double jeopardy is?

1224
01:23:36,073 --> 01:23:39,210
- I don't give a damn
about double jeopardy.

1225
01:23:39,210 --> 01:23:40,683
We want justice!

1226
01:23:43,060 --> 01:23:45,570
If this drags on and these people

1227
01:23:45,570 --> 01:23:47,820
are allowed to believe
they got away with it,

1228
01:23:49,110 --> 01:23:50,933
what happens next?

1229
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:57,100
What happens the next time
Carolyn is mad at her boyfriend,

1230
01:23:57,100 --> 01:23:59,613
or God forbid someday her child?

1231
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:08,793
Do something.

1232
01:24:20,552 --> 01:24:21,385
Becky.

1233
01:24:23,052 --> 01:24:24,973
I'm so glad, I'm so glad you're here.

1234
01:24:26,410 --> 01:24:28,263
- Oh, my darling.

1235
01:24:28,263 --> 01:24:29,250
How was your flight?

1236
01:24:29,250 --> 01:24:30,223
- It was good.

1237
01:24:31,860 --> 01:24:33,060
How's it going in there?

1238
01:24:34,653 --> 01:24:35,740
- Well, we don't know yet.

1239
01:24:35,740 --> 01:24:36,840
The attorneys are just

1240
01:24:37,690 --> 01:24:40,620
presenting the evidence to the grand jury.

1241
01:24:40,620 --> 01:24:42,662
- Why don't they just arrest them?

1242
01:24:42,662 --> 01:24:45,550
- This is the only way
they can get the Blairs

1243
01:24:45,550 --> 01:24:47,050
to trial without Timmy's body.

1244
01:24:49,876 --> 01:24:51,297
- Have they called you yet?

1245
01:24:51,297 --> 01:24:52,247
- Yeah, both of us.

1246
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:02,593
- I did it.

1247
01:25:05,450 --> 01:25:06,533
- Thank you, Jen.

1248
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:11,980
This is our daughter, Becky.

1249
01:25:11,980 --> 01:25:12,813
- Hi.
- Hi.

1250
01:25:15,570 --> 01:25:18,020
- A friend of mine called
from the courthouse.

1251
01:25:18,020 --> 01:25:19,920
The grand jury is meeting as we speak.

1252
01:25:20,990 --> 01:25:22,740
If they indict Carolyn with the murder

1253
01:25:22,740 --> 01:25:24,380
and disposal of the body,

1254
01:25:24,380 --> 01:25:27,540
that negates my ability to use
self-defense as a strategy,

1255
01:25:27,540 --> 01:25:28,690
you have to know that.

1256
01:25:28,690 --> 01:25:29,990
- What are you telling me?

1257
01:25:30,980 --> 01:25:33,800
- Killing him to protect
herself is one thing,

1258
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:36,250
but not calling the cops,
not doing the right thing,

1259
01:25:36,250 --> 01:25:38,240
how am I gonna explain that to a jury?

1260
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:39,690
You're gonna have to step up

1261
01:25:39,690 --> 01:25:41,940
and admit to the dumping of the body

1262
01:25:41,940 --> 01:25:44,390
or there's a good chance
she's gonna do big time.

1263
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:47,510
- What could they have?

1264
01:25:48,740 --> 01:25:50,650
- Your daughter on tape.

1265
01:25:50,650 --> 01:25:52,323
They can place the Dolan kid,

1266
01:25:53,750 --> 01:25:55,450
and they have good blood evidence.

1267
01:25:58,620 --> 01:26:00,190
You people didn't do a very good job

1268
01:26:00,190 --> 01:26:02,460
of cleaning up after yourselves.

1269
01:26:02,460 --> 01:26:03,810
- Well, you'll have to excuse me.

1270
01:26:03,810 --> 01:26:05,867
I'm a little rusty at murder scenes.

1271
01:26:29,112 --> 01:26:32,612
- I've come for your daughter, Mrs. Blair.

1272
01:26:42,072 --> 01:26:42,905
The grand jury has indicted you

1273
01:26:42,905 --> 01:26:45,320
for the murder of Timothy Michael Dolan.

1274
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:47,523
Carolyn Blair, you are under arrest.

1275
01:26:52,060 --> 01:26:54,400
- Can I bring her
downtown with our lawyer?

1276
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:56,830
- No, but I can't stop you

1277
01:26:56,830 --> 01:26:58,787
from following us to headquarters.

1278
01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:00,790
Before we ask you any questions,

1279
01:27:00,790 --> 01:27:01,760
you must understand your rights.

1280
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:03,550
You have the right to remain silent.

1281
01:27:03,550 --> 01:27:04,623
Anything you say can be used against you

1282
01:27:04,623 --> 01:27:07,001
in the court of law.

1283
01:27:40,419 --> 01:27:42,877
- You took me into your home.

1284
01:27:42,877 --> 01:27:45,703
You behaved like a daughter to me.

1285
01:27:46,728 --> 01:27:49,939
And all the while you
and your loving family

1286
01:27:49,939 --> 01:27:54,678
knew my son was the bottom of the lake.

1287
01:27:54,678 --> 01:27:58,078
You took away a good, loving boy.

1288
01:27:58,078 --> 01:28:02,495
You took him away when he
was just beginning to live.

1289
01:28:35,017 --> 01:28:36,733
- Well, I think this will be good.

1290
01:28:37,580 --> 01:28:39,080
Stop the boat, please.

1291
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:40,030
- Yes, sir.

1292
01:28:49,080 --> 01:28:49,930
- You okay, Faye?

1293
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:54,100
- As all right as I'm gonna be.

1294
01:28:54,100 --> 01:28:55,583
Tell me we did right by him.

1295
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:03,603
- We raised our child to be
good and caring, to love life.

1296
01:29:04,460 --> 01:29:05,910
That's all any parent can do.

1297
01:29:08,924 --> 01:29:13,924
That's all you could've done.

1298
01:29:16,453 --> 01:29:18,741
- Sweetheart, it's okay.

1299
01:29:25,793 --> 01:29:27,460
- I love you, Timmy.

1300
01:29:41,502 --> 01:29:42,335
- Tim.
