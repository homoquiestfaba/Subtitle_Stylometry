00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:25,919
Cassandra was not the one.

3
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,787
It appears she was not.

4
00:01:27,787 --> 00:01:30,824
You’ll be entering
your 100th year.
We must find the one.

5
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:33,059
I am more than aware of
what will happen if we do not.

6
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:36,196
We don’t have much time.
You’ve got ancient blood that--

7
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:38,198
Thank you for
the reminder, Logan.

8
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:40,567
I’m aware of my lineage
and what I must do.

00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:42,769
Los Angeles.

10
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:45,272
The City of Angels.

11
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:47,440
Let us hope that I find mine.

Hey.

Hey, let me help you with those.

20
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:24,504
So, this is the place, huh?

21
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:27,440
Yeah.

22
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,744
I know it’s not much,
but it does keep the rain out.

23
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:32,479
I’m sorry.
I didn’t mean to be rude.

24
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:34,881
It’s just like the pictures
you sent me online.

25
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,416
Hey, no offense taken.

26
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:39,619
- Great first impression, huh?
- Yeah.

27
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:41,755
- I’m Caleb.
- I’m Paul.

28
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:43,556
It’s really nice
to finally meet you.

29
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,325
Let’s take your stuff inside
and get you settled,

30
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:46,726
and I’ll show you
around the place.

31
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,194
Sounds like a plan.

32
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:50,730
Hey, dude, dude.
Not on the grass. Come on.

33
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:55,135
Home sweet home.

34
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:58,438
This place is really...

35
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,674
great.

36
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:04,677
Well, I mean,
it’s functional,

37
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:07,113
but what more does
a college student need, right?

38
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:09,449
Not much more, I suppose.

39
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:12,819
So, uh, first time
being away from home.

40
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:17,724
I’ve been on my own
about two years now,

41
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:20,827
and I love my freedom.

42
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:23,663
If you don’t mind my asking,

43
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:26,332
how did you find
such a great place so cheap?

44
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:30,303
You know, I mean,
I have my connections.

45
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:33,206
Actually, um, my parents
used to own this place,

46
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:34,908
so it’s all paid for
free and clear.

47
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:36,676
Pretty sweet deal.

48
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:37,911
Yeah, no shit.

49
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:39,779
Besides, I have no desire
to be anywhere else.

50
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,981
I’m a California boy
through and through.

51
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:44,083
Sure beats living in Ohio.

52
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,752
Doesn’t it smell there?

53
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:47,220
Don’t remind me.

54
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,423
Let me take you to the bedroom.

55
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:04,771
It’s really great-- you
letting me stay here for free.

56
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:08,107
Hey, like I said,
this place is all paid for,

57
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:11,110
and utilities don’t cost much,
so you can pitch in with those.

58
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,745
Sounds more than fair.

59
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:15,081
I was actually gonna
have some coffee.
Care to join me?

60
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:17,784
I can show you
the neighborhood a bit.
My treat.

61
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:19,686
That sounds nice.

62
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:22,489
It’s a pretty
friendly neighborhood.

63
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,824
I can see that.
Quiet, too.

64
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,327
Yeah, and they’re
pretty receptive

65
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,829
to, uh,
all types of people.

66
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,631
Good to know.

67
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:42,342
Not bad.

68
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,844
This was a really great idea.
Thanks.

69
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,680
Hey. My pleasure.

70
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,949
So, what did you do
in high school?

71
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:51,518
Basketball? Football?

72
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:52,785
Swimming was my thing.

73
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:54,854
All-state champ
three years in a row.

74
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:58,157
Impressive. You could be
the next Michael Phelps.

75
00:05:58,157 --> 00:06:00,426
I have hung up my Speedo.

76
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:03,162
Focusing solely on academics.

77
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:05,164
Mmm. A brainy jock.

78
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:06,933
So few in existence.

79
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:11,237
Oh, we are a rare breed.

80
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:14,874
[chuckles]

81
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:28,788
Oh, another beautiful
California day.

82
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:31,991
Even though I can’t
feel the heat of the sun,

83
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:35,028
I’m so pleased that the myths
about vampires and the sun

84
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:36,829
were just that-- myths.

85
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:40,900
Yeah. Skin still tans
pretty well, too.

86
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,671
You two can be absolutely
ridiculous at times.

87
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:47,540
Sorry, Logan, we’re not
as old and mature as you.

88
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,876
- Or as fat.
- Children.

89
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:52,979
- Both of you.
- Forever and ever.

90
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,069
What did you see?

91
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:19,405
It was a person.
A male.

92
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:21,908
Someone who will
cross our path?

93
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:26,613
Yes. Someone who will be
very important to me.

94
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,281
- The one?
- Don’t be stupid.

95
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:31,517
- He found the one.
- Tara?

96
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:33,419
I don’t know if she is.

97
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,357
What did he look like?

98
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:40,960
I-- I cannot remember.

99
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,530
But I will know him again
if I see him.

100
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:47,066
I think there was a connection,

101
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:49,235
and I think he felt it, too.

102
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:52,038
- [snapping fingers]
- Are you okay?

103
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:54,907
Are you okay?

104
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:58,444
Yeah.

105
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:00,913
That was really weird.

106
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:02,882
Uh...

107
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,119
Sorry about that.

108
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:08,221
Hey, it’s okay.

109
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:10,490
But are you okay?

110
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,059
Um, what were we talking about?

111
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:15,161
Classes tomorrow.

112
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,463
Great. I can’t believe
I just got here,

113
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:19,799
and I have to jump
right back into classes.

114
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:22,502
Are you sure you’re okay?

115
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,003
You look a little pale.

116
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:27,073
I will be.
Maybe, just, um,

117
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:29,742
rest a little
when we get back to the house.

118
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:32,845
Okay. Um,
let’s head back then.

119
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,480
Come on.

120
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,393
Hello?

121
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,666
Who’s there?

122
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:38,211
I’ve seen you before.

123
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:40,546
And I have seen you.

124
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:42,548
Who are you?

125
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:45,485
I would like to know
the same of you.

126
00:09:45,485 --> 00:09:49,021
I don’t understand
what’s going on.

127
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:54,260
Dreams are often subject
to interpretation.

128
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,629
Is this a dream?

129
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:59,031
Would you prefer a nightmare?

130
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,667
No.

131
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:11,944
We’ll meet again.

132
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:21,788
- Morning.
- Hey. Morning.

133
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:25,725
Coffee’s ready.

134
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:33,466
Awkward.

135
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,501
Um, let me go
throw something on.

136
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:38,437
Hey, it’s not a big deal for me
if it isn’t for you.

137
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:41,007
We’re roommates, right?

138
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:43,442
So, you ready
for your first day?

139
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:47,079
I think so. I didn’t get
very much sleep last night.

140
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:50,616
- Homesick?
- Nothing like that.

141
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:53,152
I had a weird dream.

142
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,021
You remember any of it?

143
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,722
I feel like
I should remember it,

144
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:58,591
but every time I try,

145
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:00,393
nothing comes to me.

146
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:03,095
Well, you’ll have plenty
to take your mind off it today.

147
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:05,464
I took the liberty of looking up
your classes online,

148
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:07,033
and we have some
classes together.

149
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:08,534
Excellent.

150
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:09,902
I hate being
in new situations

151
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:12,505
with everybody staring at me.

152
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,640
Mmm.

153
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:12,198
So, how’s the first
few hours been?

154
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:14,734
Pretty good, and I think
I’m getting into college life.

155
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,769
Ah. Just wait until
the parties start.

156
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:18,404
That’s true college life.

I mean, I’ve never seen them
on campus before.

168
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:52,471
Hi, my name’s Jasin.

169
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:55,140
You’re new here,
aren’t you?

170
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,842
Just moved here yesterday.

171
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:59,945
Hi, I’m Paul, his roommate.

172
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:03,148
I did not mean
to come across forward.

173
00:13:03,148 --> 00:13:05,684
I fancy myself a welcome wagon
of sorts.

174
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:08,353
It’s not a problem at all.

175
00:13:08,353 --> 00:13:12,124
How rude of me.
Paul, did you say?

176
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,092
Yeah.

177
00:13:16,161 --> 00:13:18,163
Let me introduce my brothers.

178
00:13:18,163 --> 00:13:21,466
This is Logan, Dane, and Adam.

179
00:13:21,466 --> 00:13:23,301
Brothers?

180
00:13:23,301 --> 00:13:25,337
Something like that.

181
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:29,374
Hey, guys. I’m...Paul.

182
00:13:29,374 --> 00:13:32,077
They don’t say much.

183
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:36,214
I saw you in class
earlier today.

184
00:13:36,214 --> 00:13:39,885
It looks like
we’ll be seeing each other
every morning.

185
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:42,387
I suppose so.

186
00:13:42,387 --> 00:13:45,190
Can I expect coffee
every morning?

187
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,925
You just never know.

188
00:13:46,925 --> 00:13:48,960
There you are.

189
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:54,733
Hey, guys.

190
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:57,269
So, who are your new friends?

191
00:13:57,269 --> 00:14:00,505
I am just neglecting
my manners completely today.

192
00:14:00,505 --> 00:14:03,308
I’m Caleb. This is Paul.

193
00:14:03,308 --> 00:14:06,411
I think you were in one of
my classes this morning.

194
00:14:06,411 --> 00:14:07,546
I’m Tara.

195
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:09,414
[Paul]
Possibly. Was it psych?

196
00:14:09,414 --> 00:14:11,416
I thought you looked familiar.

197
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,118
Yeah. Small world.

198
00:14:15,787 --> 00:14:18,356
So, will I see you tonight?

199
00:14:18,356 --> 00:14:20,325
Actually,
I was just getting ready

200
00:14:20,325 --> 00:14:21,760
to ask my new friend here

201
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,596
if he would like
a tour of the city.

202
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:27,466
You’re new to L.A.?

203
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:29,267
Fresh off the boat.

204
00:14:29,267 --> 00:14:30,535
How about it, Caleb?

205
00:14:30,535 --> 00:14:33,105
Uh, yeah,
that would be great.

206
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:36,141
Well, I suppose
I can take a rain check.

207
00:14:42,347 --> 00:14:45,317
We don’t have anything
planned this evening, do we?

208
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:47,319
Um, no. No.

209
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:48,887
I mean, go have fun.

210
00:14:48,887 --> 00:14:51,790
Are you sure?
What if he came with us?

211
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,325
Would that be okay?

212
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:55,627
Go. I mean, I’ve seen the city
a thousand times.

213
00:14:55,627 --> 00:14:57,629
So, you know,
we’ll catch up later.

214
00:14:57,629 --> 00:15:00,065
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

215
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:02,601
We are roommates, right?
We’ll be seeing each other
in no time.

216
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:04,436
It’s bound to happen.

217
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:06,772
So this evening.
I can pick you up.

218
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:09,374
I don’t have a car,
so that would be great.

219
00:15:09,374 --> 00:15:10,742
Uh...

220
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:15,714
Uh, here is where
I’ll be staying.

221
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:17,716
I put my cell on there, too.

222
00:15:19,217 --> 00:15:20,519
Excellent.

223
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:24,890
I think we should go anyway.
Your first class
is about to start.

224
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,591
Uh, we have this one
together, right?

225
00:15:26,591 --> 00:15:28,426
- Yeah.
- Uh, excellent.

226
00:15:28,426 --> 00:15:30,262
I’ll be there around 9:00.

227
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,798
I’ll see you this evening.

228
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:38,670
That was interesting.

229
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,105
I’m sorry?

230
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,073
He’s a fine catch
for sure, but...
[scoffs]

231
00:15:42,073 --> 00:15:45,310
- Let it be, Logan.
- Mind your own business, Adam.

232
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:48,447
Jasin finding the right one
is my business,
in case you’ve forgotten.

233
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:52,117
- We all need this.
- Remember, his fate
is our fate.

234
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,386
Let’s not dwell on it
for the moment.

235
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:56,988
So, what, are you having
second thoughts about Tara?

236
00:15:56,988 --> 00:15:58,990
There is something about Caleb.

237
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:01,326
Something I cannot describe.

238
00:16:01,326 --> 00:16:04,596
- His blood.
- I’ve never inhaled
such a fragrance.

239
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:06,198
Oh, he’s definitely appetizing.

240
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:08,900
He is off-limits.
Do you all understand?

241
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,603
He is not to be harmed
in any way.

242
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,606
You think he’s the one.

243
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,176
Anything is possible.

244
00:16:20,712 --> 00:16:23,815
I must feed before tonight.

245
00:16:36,761 --> 00:16:38,563
- It’s getting late.
- Yeah.

246
00:16:38,563 --> 00:16:41,633
Trevor, where’s the spot
you’ve got all picked out?

247
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:43,935
Relax. It’s close.

248
00:16:43,935 --> 00:16:46,071
It’s worth the wait.

249
00:16:57,983 --> 00:17:00,852
[clicks teeth]
Wow.

250
00:17:00,852 --> 00:17:02,721
Isn’t this worth the wait?

251
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:07,425
Speaking of waiting, Eli,

252
00:17:07,425 --> 00:17:11,096
you wanna know what I’ve
been waiting a long time for?

253
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:12,197
What?

254
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,298
To kiss you.

255
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:15,867
Whoa. Awkward.
What are you getting at?

256
00:17:15,867 --> 00:17:17,669
I’m getting at

257
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:20,672
I think that the three of us
make a nice couple, don’t you?

258
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:23,675
- Two of us make a couple,
but three of us--
- Enough, Trevor.

259
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:28,313
Eli, do you find me attractive?

260
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:30,048
You know I always have.

261
00:17:30,048 --> 00:17:32,584
Jen, you’re my girlfriend.
What’s the deal?

262
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:33,919
[sighs]

263
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,489
Would you be interested
in sex in the outdoors?

264
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:39,391
Here?

265
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,126
[Trevor]
Jen,

266
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:44,229
I thought we only
talked about this.

267
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,297
[sighs]

268
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:47,098
Are you sure? With Eli?

269
00:17:53,104 --> 00:17:56,508
I think I’m picking up
on what you’re hinting at.

270
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:59,844
Okay. Jesus, Trevor.
You wouldn’t pick up
on what I’m hinting at

271
00:17:59,844 --> 00:18:02,514
if FedEx delivered
an invitation to your door.

272
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:04,916
Okay? This is not a hint.

273
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:06,918
I am balls-out asking.

274
00:18:06,918 --> 00:18:08,753
Pardon the expression.

275
00:18:08,753 --> 00:18:11,423
[Eli]
I follow you, Jen.

276
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,425
Okay.

277
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,627
So, now,

278
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:18,330
to get to me,

279
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,166
you’re gonna have to go
through him first.

280
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:24,536
Huh?

281
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:27,372
I want you guys

282
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:29,174
to strip down

283
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:32,310
and then give each other
a nice big kiss.

284
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:36,014
I’m getting hot
just thinking about it.

285
00:18:37,882 --> 00:18:41,486
I want you guys to start
taking your clothes off,

286
00:18:41,486 --> 00:18:44,622
or I’m gonna start
putting more clothing on.

287
00:18:44,622 --> 00:18:47,192
Yes.

288
00:18:51,696 --> 00:18:53,365
Pants, boys.

289
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:55,200
Okay.

290
00:19:07,612 --> 00:19:09,147
[mouths words]

291
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,649
[Jen]
Okay.

292
00:19:11,649 --> 00:19:14,319
Now you guys
better kiss each other.

293
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:37,075
Well, what do you know?

294
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:39,544
Ah, the shy type.
I like that.

295
00:19:39,544 --> 00:19:41,746
We don’t want any trouble.
We’ll leave.

296
00:19:41,746 --> 00:19:43,214
Yeah, the place is all yours.

297
00:19:43,214 --> 00:19:45,316
Ah, we were hoping
you’d stick around.

298
00:19:45,316 --> 00:19:48,253
Six guys, one girl.

299
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:51,256
- Alone in a field.
- Sounds like a party to me.

300
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:54,659
You wouldn’t wanna leave
the party now, would you?

301
00:19:54,659 --> 00:19:56,394
Open your eyes.

302
00:19:56,394 --> 00:19:58,363
I said, open your eyes!

303
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,798
[laughing]

304
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:02,600
[sniffs]
Your blood smells weak,

305
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,771
but I have not fed
in a very long, long time.

306
00:20:06,771 --> 00:20:09,040
So I will sacrifice
my own palate

307
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,576
in order to satiate
the nerving hunger

308
00:20:11,576 --> 00:20:15,113

312
00:20:27,258 --> 00:20:31,496
Now I will not crave
his blood tonight.

Yeah, right.

No calls.

320
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,331
What time is it?

321
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:07,832
Nearly 9:00.

322
00:21:07,832 --> 00:21:10,001
So, uh, what are you guys
gonna do?

323
00:21:10,001 --> 00:21:12,504
I don’t know.
It happened really fast.

324
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:15,840
- I’ll say.
- What’s that supposed to mean?

325
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,642
Nothing.

326
00:21:17,642 --> 00:21:20,311
I mean, neither of us
know this guy very well,

327
00:21:20,311 --> 00:21:24,115
and I’ve never seen him
around campus before.

328
00:21:24,115 --> 00:21:27,085
He’s extending the proverbial
olive branch,

329
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:28,486
trying to meet new people.

330
00:21:28,486 --> 00:21:30,989
Right. Except that
he didn’t invite me.

331
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:32,791
Are you jealous?

332
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,459
No, of course not.

333
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,961
- Don’t be stupid.
- [phone ringing]

334
00:21:39,397 --> 00:21:40,832
Hello?

335
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:42,700
Are you outside?

336
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,936
Do you wanna come in?

337
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:46,971
Okay. I’ll be right out.

338
00:21:46,971 --> 00:21:50,175
Wait.
He’s been sitting outside?

339
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:51,810
Don’t wait up for me, okay?

340
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,378

341
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:54,879
Well, have fun.

00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:58,349
Don’t forget
we have classes tomorrow.

343
00:21:58,349 --> 00:21:59,617
Thanks, Dad.

344
00:22:11,996 --> 00:22:14,365
- Good evening.
- Hey, there.

345
00:22:14,365 --> 00:22:17,902
- Nice night, huh?
- Even better now.

346
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,342
You didn’t have to do that.

347
00:22:24,342 --> 00:22:26,344
It would do my mother proud
to see I have not

348
00:22:26,344 --> 00:22:28,379
totally abandoned
all of my upbringing.

349
00:22:28,379 --> 00:22:30,548
Wouldn’t want to disappoint
your mother, would we?

350
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:51,069
So tell me a few things
about yourself.

351
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:52,904
You get right to the point.

352
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:56,975
I’m sorry. I’m always bad
with breaking the ice.

353

any awkwardness.

How about I just hit you
with a blizzard of questions,

356
00:23:07,652 --> 00:23:10,655
and you can answer which ones
you feel comfortable?

357
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:15,026
Sounds fair,
only if I can do the same.

358
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:16,928
Where are you from?

359
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:19,030
Ohio.

360
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,765
Oh, you’re a long way from home.

361
00:23:20,765 --> 00:23:22,433
That was kind of the point.

362
00:23:22,433 --> 00:23:24,435
Why is that?

363
00:23:24,435 --> 00:23:29,507
I just wanted to get away
from the whole Midwestern world.

364
00:23:29,507 --> 00:23:32,477
I wish I understood
what that meant.

365
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:36,114
I was the all-star swim champ
in a small town.

366
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:38,116
I was kind of treated
like a god.

367
00:23:38,116 --> 00:23:41,352
That doesn’t sound too bad.

368
00:23:41,352 --> 00:23:45,823
It got very demanding,
very tiring.

369
00:23:45,823 --> 00:23:48,192
It just wasn’t my thing.

370
00:23:48,192 --> 00:23:51,829
The perfect all-American boy.

371
00:23:51,829 --> 00:23:54,098
Something like that.

372
00:23:54,098 --> 00:23:58,436
Okay. Next question.

373
00:23:58,436 --> 00:24:03,741
What’s the story
with you and your roommate?

374
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,312
Paul?

375
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:12,317
I answered an online ad
for a roommate.

376
00:24:13,751 --> 00:24:17,822
We started sending e-mails
back and forth.

377
00:24:17,822 --> 00:24:21,559
I really don’t know
that much about him.

378
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:24,762
And you trust him enough
to move into his home.

379
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:28,232
He seems harmless enough.

380
00:24:28,232 --> 00:24:32,503
He seems...nice.

381
00:24:33,771 --> 00:24:35,640
I probably shouldn’t.

382
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,544
Don’t wanna put on
the freshman 15.

383
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:42,513
You look great.

384
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:45,450
Thanks.

385
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:48,486
So let me ask you a question.

386
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:51,389
Um, what’s your last name?

387
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:52,256
Gavlin.

388
00:24:52,256 --> 00:24:53,925
And where are you from?

389
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:55,326
Ah, that’s two questions.

390
00:24:55,326 --> 00:24:57,128
Just playing catch-up.

391
00:24:57,128 --> 00:24:58,930
Fair enough.

392
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:02,967
I have been all over,
but I was born in London.

393
00:25:02,967 --> 00:25:04,469
No accent?

394
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:07,572
No. My family moved to
the States when I was only two.

395
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:11,242
Not enough time
to develop the accent.

396
00:25:11,242 --> 00:25:13,811
Are you going to be swimming
for the school?

397
00:25:15,613 --> 00:25:19,050
No interest.
Purely academic.

398
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:23,154
The other three guys--
who are they?

399
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:25,490
Just some very close friends.

400
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:29,060
We have been together
a long time.

401
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,529
Uh, they are like brothers
to me.

402
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:36,501
It’s good to have
a close circle of friends.

403
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:38,136
And Tara?

404
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:44,075
She and I have been dating
for several months now.

405
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:47,278
Uh, but I wanna know

406
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:50,548
more about Caleb--

407
00:25:50,548 --> 00:25:52,050
Caleb...

408
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,084
Donovan.

409
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:55,086
Caleb Donovan.

410
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:57,722
Well, there’s not much to tell.

411
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:00,892
I really just wanna focus
on school while I’m here.

412
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:03,261
Graduate, good job,

413
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:05,930
uh, make the most out of life.

414
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:08,433
Travel,
the whole nine yards.

415
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:11,636
That sounds like
the perfect plan.

416
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:16,841
I have my own plan
for the future.

417
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,444
Really? What is that?

418
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:24,215
Maybe we’ll save that
for another time.

419
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:38,896
I had a really
great time tonight.

420
00:26:38,896 --> 00:26:41,899
As did I.

421
00:26:41,899 --> 00:26:46,971
So I’ll see you tomorrow?

422
00:26:46,971 --> 00:26:50,208
I believe that is possible.

423
00:26:55,213 --> 00:26:57,782
Um,

424
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:00,184
see you tomorrow.

425
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:22,240
- Hey.
- Hey. How was your morning?

426
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,576
- Not bad so far. Yours?
- Just a few pages.
Nothing major.

427
00:27:25,576 --> 00:27:29,780
Yeah. It’s already the first few
days of class, and they’re
starting full force, huh?

428
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,782
- So what’s for lunch?
- I don’t know,

429
00:27:31,782 --> 00:27:33,818
but I was thinking
of something nice and greasy.

430
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:36,254
- Cafeteria food’s pretty lame.
- Yeah.

431
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:37,622
Do you wanna go off campus?

432
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:39,457
No. I have another class
in 20 minutes.

433
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:41,592
Okay. Well,
maybe this evening.

434
00:27:41,592 --> 00:27:42,760
Dinner?

435
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,229
Yeah.
A big greasy hamburger,

436
00:27:45,229 --> 00:27:47,398
French fries,
double-chocolate shake.

437
00:27:47,398 --> 00:27:49,634
That’ll take
a few days to work off.

438
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:51,936
Well, I’m gonna go
to the house.

439
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:53,871
I’ll see you later.

440
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:04,448
- [Caleb]
So glad this day is over.
- Yeah. No shit.

441
00:28:04,448 --> 00:28:06,751
- Jasin!
- Oh, boy.

442
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:10,021
Caleb, I was looking
for you today.

443
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:13,624
Hey. I didn’t see you
in class this morning.

444
00:28:13,624 --> 00:28:17,228
Would you mind if I borrow him
for a few hours this evening?

445
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:20,598
Um, we kind of already
have plans.

446
00:28:20,598 --> 00:28:24,502
I promise to have him back
before midnight.

447
00:28:25,536 --> 00:28:28,406
We did have plans
to go to dinner.

448
00:28:28,406 --> 00:28:30,675
You know what?
It’s okay. Go.

449
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:32,543
I mean,
we’ll catch up later.

450
00:28:32,543 --> 00:28:35,112
Are you sure?
I mean, we did have plans first.

451
00:28:35,112 --> 00:28:38,282
It’s fine. I have some work
to get started on anyways.

452
00:28:38,282 --> 00:28:39,917
Have fun.

453
00:28:39,917 --> 00:28:41,352
Hop in.

454
00:28:53,097 --> 00:28:54,732
[gunshot]

455
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,337
[Men muttering]

456
00:29:05,676 --> 00:29:08,012
[muttering continues]

457
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:12,917
[gunshot]

458
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:18,723
It’s so peaceful here.

459
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:22,493
Yes. One of
my favorite places.

460
00:29:23,561 --> 00:29:26,063
I had a really nice time
last night.

461
00:29:26,063 --> 00:29:27,632
As did I.

462
00:29:27,632 --> 00:29:30,067
I was hoping it would’ve
lasted much longer.

463
00:29:30,067 --> 00:29:33,104
I guess I’m rather selfish
that way.

464
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:36,507
Nothing wrong with that.

465
00:29:36,507 --> 00:29:40,678
Paul doesn’t seem
too pleased with me.

466
00:29:40,678 --> 00:29:43,147
Why do you say that?

467
00:29:43,147 --> 00:29:45,883
I get a sense he is not a fan.

468
00:29:45,883 --> 00:29:48,519
I’m sorry you feel that way.

469
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:50,888
Don’t be sorry.

470
00:29:50,888 --> 00:29:52,390
Ah.

471
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:57,061
- [metallic clank]
- Ah. Yeah.

472
00:30:07,405 --> 00:30:09,774
[mutters]

473
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:15,713
Jasin!

474
00:30:15,713 --> 00:30:18,149
- Did I hit something?
- You-- You hit something.

475
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:20,484
Go, go, go. Shit.

476
00:30:28,592 --> 00:30:31,495
Shit. Are you all right?

477
00:30:31,495 --> 00:30:33,597
- We’re fine.
- You sure, man?

478
00:30:33,597 --> 00:30:36,400
We were shooting cans, and,
you know, a stray bullet
went off.

479
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,803
- No harm done.
- Jasin, I saw.

480
00:30:38,803 --> 00:30:42,907
You are free to inspect me
if it will make you feel better.

481
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:44,075
Okay.

482
00:30:44,075 --> 00:30:45,910
So-- So we’re cool?

483
00:30:46,944 --> 00:30:48,579
- Yes.
- You’re all right?

484
00:30:48,579 --> 00:30:50,815
No need for further apologies.
We’re fine.

485
00:30:50,815 --> 00:30:53,651
We’re all good.
All righty.

486
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,860
I’m fine.

487
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:05,396
You got hit.
I saw you get hit.

488
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:08,099
It’s what you think you saw.

489
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:12,002
Go ahead.
You will find not a mark on me.

490
00:31:15,072 --> 00:31:17,842
It all happened so fast.

491
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:21,612
However, I do feel
this has put a strain

492
00:31:21,612 --> 00:31:24,181
on the afternoon.

493
00:31:24,181 --> 00:31:26,717
I should say so.

494
00:31:26,717 --> 00:31:29,787
Come. I’ll take you home.

495
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:46,971
- Surfing?
- Hey.

496
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:48,839
Um, sort of.

497
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:51,242
How much do you
really know about Jasin?

498
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:53,444
Don’t start that again.
It’s getting a little old.

499
00:31:53,444 --> 00:31:55,045
No, I’m serious.

500
00:31:55,045 --> 00:31:57,681
Look, I appreciate
your protective nature,

501
00:31:57,681 --> 00:31:59,483
but I’m a big boy.

502
00:31:59,483 --> 00:32:03,587
But how much
do we know about him?
Indulge me.

503
00:32:03,587 --> 00:32:06,724
Okay. He’s not
a California native.
He’s 20 years old.

504
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:10,094
He likes long walks
on the beach
and puppy dogs and rainbows.

505
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:12,630
- What do you want me to say?
- Look, I’m fucking serious.

506
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:15,232
Come on.
I mean, I went through
the school directory online.

507
00:32:15,232 --> 00:32:17,535
I couldn’t find anything
for a Jason Gavlin.

508
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:20,738
He doesn’t have a Facebook page,
and I couldn’t find him
on Google.

509
00:32:20,738 --> 00:32:23,374
Do you hear yourself?
What is this paranoia?

510
00:32:23,374 --> 00:32:26,744
I don’t have a Facebook page.
Does that mean there’s something
wrong with me?

511
00:32:26,744 --> 00:32:28,846
No. I mean,
I’m just worried, okay?

512
00:32:28,846 --> 00:32:30,381
Well, you don’t have to be.

513
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:32,583
Jasin’s a good guy,
and I like hanging out with him.

514
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:34,718
- I’m sorry if you don’t
feel the same way.
- But I’m concerned.

515
00:32:34,718 --> 00:32:37,655
- You’re getting too close
too fast.
- That is none of your business.

516
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:42,760
- You don’t understand.
- That’s because you aren’t
making any sense.

517
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:46,497
Wait a minute.
You’re jealous, aren’t you?

518
00:32:46,497 --> 00:32:48,732
Jealousy has nothing
to do with it.

519
00:32:48,732 --> 00:32:51,068
You’re full of shit.
You can’t stand the fact

520
00:32:51,068 --> 00:32:53,571
that I’m hanging out with Jasin
and you’re not.

521
00:32:53,571 --> 00:32:55,039
You are jealous.

522
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:57,274
You know what?
I am jealous.

523
00:32:57,274 --> 00:33:00,845
I’m jealous of him
and jealous it’s not me
spending all that time with you.

524
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:06,150
- What’s your fucking problem?
- It should be me, not him.

525
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,552
Look, it’s just not like that
with us, okay?

526
00:33:08,552 --> 00:33:10,721
We’re just friends
and roommates.

527
00:33:10,721 --> 00:33:12,256
But we could be more.

528
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:14,825
I mean, what is so fucking
special about Jasin, huh?

529
00:33:14,825 --> 00:33:16,527
Why are you so drawn to him?

530
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:18,662
It’s none of your business.

531
00:33:18,662 --> 00:33:21,632
- Why can’t you
just be my friend?
- I have friends.

532
00:33:23,868 --> 00:33:26,203
This is too much.
I have to go.

533
00:33:26,203 --> 00:33:28,239
Please don’t leave.
Let’s talk about this.

534
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:30,808
This is too intense for me.
I have to clear my head.

535
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:32,476
Then go find
your precious Jasin.

536
00:33:32,476 --> 00:33:35,479
I mean, I hope you two
will be very happy together.

537
00:33:35,479 --> 00:33:38,082
Why don’t you just
go live with him?
That’s a good idea.

538
00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:40,951
When you come back,
your stuff will be packed.

539
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:55,466
[muttering]

540
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:57,034
Ohh!

541
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:08,879
Paul is becoming
a very big problem for Caleb.

542
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:13,050
You want us to pay him a visit?

543
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,021
[Jasin]
Caleb has left the house.

544
00:34:18,555 --> 00:34:23,260
He’s angry, confused.

545
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:26,330
I will not have him
feeling this way.

546
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:28,732
What do you want us to do?

547
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,937
I need to find Caleb.

548
00:34:32,937 --> 00:34:36,607
It’s time he knew
the truth about me.

549
00:34:37,808 --> 00:34:41,979
And you’re sure he’s the one?

550
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:55,359
Make it clean.

551
00:35:10,874 --> 00:35:13,344
Penny for your thoughts.

552
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:15,946
Hey.

553
00:35:15,946 --> 00:35:18,315
You look a little upset.

554
00:35:18,315 --> 00:35:21,418
Everything okay?

555
00:35:21,418 --> 00:35:23,654
Anything I can do?

556
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:25,923
Keep me company.

557
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:30,027
Did something happen?

558
00:35:30,027 --> 00:35:32,830
Paul and I had a fight.

559
00:35:34,231 --> 00:35:37,434
You’re right.
He’s not a big fan of yours.

560
00:35:37,434 --> 00:35:39,036
Told you so.

561
00:35:40,704 --> 00:35:43,440
He crossed a line today--

562
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,844
one I didn’t wanna
cross with him.

563
00:35:50,014 --> 00:35:55,419
Things are just a little
confusing for me right now.

564
00:35:57,888 --> 00:36:00,724
How can I make it better?

565
00:36:00,724 --> 00:36:02,860
Your being here makes it better.

566
00:36:04,528 --> 00:36:06,864
I am pleased to hear that.

567
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,642
Caleb?

568
00:36:18,642 --> 00:36:20,911
I wanna apologize.

569
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:24,915
Caleb!

570
00:36:27,684 --> 00:36:29,586
Caleb!

571
00:36:29,586 --> 00:36:31,121
[sighs]

572
00:36:35,325 --> 00:36:37,828
Are you leaving already?
You just got here.

573
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:40,264
Hey-- Hey, guys.
Um, have you seen Caleb?

574
00:36:40,264 --> 00:36:42,266
He’s occupied at the moment.

575
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:45,302
You’ve become a little bit
of a problem for Jasin.

576
00:36:45,302 --> 00:36:47,438
- [chuckling]
- What do you mean?

577
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:50,007
You should’ve stayed
away from Caleb.

578
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:51,542
Look, Caleb’s my friend.

579
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:53,210
I’m trying to find him
to apologize.

580
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:54,711
Well, he’s more than that
to Jasin.

581
00:36:54,711 --> 00:36:57,214
Yeah. We will not allow you
to stand in their way.

582
00:36:57,214 --> 00:36:58,148

What, you knew
that I’d put out?

602
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:21,031
No.

603
00:38:21,031 --> 00:38:23,967
I knew that you were the one.

604
00:38:23,967 --> 00:38:25,569
I don’t understand.

605
00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:29,740
It’s rather complicated,
but I promise I will tell you.

606
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,708
What’s wrong with now?

607
00:38:31,708 --> 00:38:34,111
As I said, it’s complicated.

608
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:37,648
I can handle complex situations.

609
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:40,484
I’m sure you are more
than capable.

610
00:38:43,353 --> 00:38:45,789
Something wrong?

611
00:38:45,789 --> 00:38:50,127
I just don’t think things
are working out with Paul.

612
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:53,831
You’re-- You’re right.
He’s not a big fan of yours.

613
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:57,000
I was not put on this earth
to please everyone.

614
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,136
I can live with that.

615
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:02,105
He freaked out on me.

616
00:39:02,105 --> 00:39:04,508
He started going off
about how you’re not

617
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:07,611
in the school directory
and stuff like that.

618
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:11,982
He does know that hacking
is a punishable offense, right?

619
00:39:13,083 --> 00:39:15,018
He kissed me.

620
00:39:15,018 --> 00:39:17,888
Did you kiss him back?

621
00:39:17,888 --> 00:39:19,389
No.

622
00:39:19,389 --> 00:39:21,592
Well, his lips were on mine,

623
00:39:21,592 --> 00:39:23,460
so I suppose so.

624
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:27,598
What I mean is,
when he kissed you,
did you accept it?

625
00:39:27,598 --> 00:39:29,466
No, I pulled away.

626
00:39:29,466 --> 00:39:33,170
Then you did not
kiss him back.

627
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:36,073
I suppose so.

628
00:39:36,073 --> 00:39:38,976
Let me show you what I mean.

629
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:52,789
What the hell was that?

630
00:39:52,789 --> 00:39:54,758
I’m sorry.
I did not mean

631
00:39:54,758 --> 00:39:56,960
to be so quick about
revealing my secret to you.

632
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,329
I suppose I just
could not resist.

633
00:39:59,329 --> 00:40:02,532
You truly have no idea

634
00:40:02,532 --> 00:40:04,668
you are the one.

635
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:07,704
What the fuck
are you talking about?

636
00:40:07,704 --> 00:40:11,108
Like I said,
it’s really complicated,

637
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:13,543
but you need to know the truth.

638
00:40:13,543 --> 00:40:15,679
I am...

639
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:18,715
You are what?

640
00:40:20,317 --> 00:40:21,852
Even if I tell you the truth,

641
00:40:21,852 --> 00:40:23,587
your mind will not be able
to comprehend it.

642
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:25,656
You said you wanted me to know.
Tell me.

643
00:40:25,656 --> 00:40:27,658
It’s more complicated
than just blurting the word--

644
00:40:27,658 --> 00:40:30,127
I don’t care.
You tell me the truth.

645
00:40:32,429 --> 00:40:34,064
I am a vampire.

646
00:40:36,166 --> 00:40:39,002
What? What?

647
00:40:39,002 --> 00:40:42,406
- What the hell
are you talking about?
- If you’ll let me explain--

648
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:44,574
Like I said, it’s complicated.

649
00:40:44,574 --> 00:40:46,076
Please, if you will
let me explain.

650
00:40:46,076 --> 00:40:47,978
No. Stay away from me.

651
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:50,013
No...

652
00:40:50,013 --> 00:40:51,648
Shit.

653
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:17,708
[vampires laughing]

654
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:19,576
[howling]

655
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:22,245
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

656
00:41:22,245 --> 00:41:24,281
- [howling]
- Yeah!

657
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:27,117
- Burn, baby!
- [mutters]

658
00:41:28,485 --> 00:41:30,787
Did you take care of Paul?

659
00:41:30,787 --> 00:41:32,589
Would you expect anything less?

660
00:41:32,589 --> 00:41:35,392
It’s amazing
how some humans burn.

661
00:41:35,392 --> 00:41:37,761
I do not find that
the least bit comical.

662
00:41:41,131 --> 00:41:42,299
Sorry.

663
00:41:42,299 --> 00:41:44,401
Yeah. Sorry, Jasin.

664
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:53,443
By the look on your face,
I can see that he didn’t
accept the truth.

665
00:41:53,443 --> 00:41:55,879
What makes you believe
I divulged anything to him?

666
00:41:55,879 --> 00:41:58,382
Oh, you slept with him.

667
00:41:59,883 --> 00:42:02,386
The way you’ve been going
on and on

668
00:42:02,386 --> 00:42:05,389
about this connection
that you have...

669
00:42:07,657 --> 00:42:09,593
You love him.

670
00:42:09,593 --> 00:42:13,663
And you told him,
didn’t you?

671
00:42:13,663 --> 00:42:15,332
I did.

672
00:42:15,332 --> 00:42:17,868
Let me guess.
He had the exact same reaction

673
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:19,669
that Cassandra did.

674
00:42:19,669 --> 00:42:22,672
Cassandra accepted
the initial idea
of being with a vampire.

675
00:42:22,672 --> 00:42:26,243
It’s still unclear to me
as to what changed with her.

676
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:28,111
What about Tara?
You were convinced

677
00:42:28,111 --> 00:42:30,814
that she was the one
before Caleb was even
in the picture.

678
00:42:34,117 --> 00:42:36,186
What happened?

679
00:42:37,554 --> 00:42:39,890
This decision is greater
than any other

680
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,691
I’ve been forced to make.

681
00:42:41,691 --> 00:42:44,661
I must be sure
to choose wisely...

682
00:42:44,661 --> 00:42:46,363
with my heart.

683
00:42:46,363 --> 00:42:49,132
Are you sure that’s what
you’re choosing with?

684
00:42:49,132 --> 00:42:52,903
- What are you implying?
- Logan, you know that
Jasin is sincere.

685
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:55,238
He’s not just thinking
with his dick.

686
00:42:55,238 --> 00:42:56,706
Let a vampire be in love.

687
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:00,911
If he’s not,

688
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:02,913
then we’ll all soon perish.

689
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:04,848
I do not wanna think about that.

690
00:43:04,848 --> 00:43:06,183
He will make the right decision.

691
00:43:06,183 --> 00:43:07,784
Mind your own business,
both of you.

692
00:43:07,784 --> 00:43:08,919
I have been through this

693
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:10,754
with him more times
than you can count.

694
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:13,457
We’ve all been part of
this coven for many, many years.

695
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:16,359
We stand behind Jasin
and his decision.

696
00:43:16,359 --> 00:43:17,828
Thank you for your loyalty.

697
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:27,270
Caleb...is a phase.

698
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:30,540
Tara’s the one
you’re supposed to be with.
You know that.

699
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:34,911
I believe that decision
is left up to me,
is it not?

700
00:43:34,911 --> 00:43:36,713
Jasin,

701
00:43:36,713 --> 00:43:39,649
I know how you feel
about Caleb.

702
00:43:39,649 --> 00:43:42,285
I know that you think
that he is the one.

703
00:43:42,285 --> 00:43:43,920
But how can you be sure?

704
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,123
You’ve only known him
for a few days.

705
00:43:47,123 --> 00:43:49,759
Are you challenging me, Logan?

706
00:43:49,759 --> 00:43:52,195
I do not wanna die
because you can’t figure out

707
00:43:52,195 --> 00:43:54,664
who you wanna spend
eternity with.

708
00:43:57,033 --> 00:43:59,336
But I don’t have a choice.

709
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:05,942
You created me,

710
00:44:05,942 --> 00:44:07,911
and I perish when you do.

711
00:44:07,911 --> 00:44:11,715
I agree that it is not fair,
but I did not write the rules.

712
00:44:11,715 --> 00:44:13,750
I am bound to them more so
than any of you.

713
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:16,953
Then why don’t you just
make Tara one tonight?

714
00:44:16,953 --> 00:44:20,724
- She’s ready
to be turned, and--
- Enough discussion.

715
00:44:27,397 --> 00:44:29,432
Evening, boys.

716
00:44:30,333 --> 00:44:33,036
Did I come at a bad time?

717
00:44:33,036 --> 00:44:35,805
Everything is as it should be.

718
00:44:40,277 --> 00:44:41,978
How are you this evening?

719
00:44:41,978 --> 00:44:43,780
Come on, guys.

720
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:46,516
Why don’t we give them
their privacy?

721
00:44:53,957 --> 00:44:56,393
Something wrong with Logan?

722
00:44:56,393 --> 00:44:58,495
Nothing at all.

723
00:44:59,996 --> 00:45:04,768
So, are you going to make me
a vampire tonight or what?

724
00:45:06,703 --> 00:45:09,239
Not tonight.

725
00:45:11,308 --> 00:45:13,843
Soon, I hope?

726
00:45:13,843 --> 00:45:17,581
I will follow you
to the ends of the earth.

727
00:45:50,981 --> 00:45:52,515
Paul?

728
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:58,755
Paul?

729
00:46:16,373 --> 00:46:18,008
[mutters]

730
00:46:18,008 --> 00:46:20,577
[clatter]

731
00:46:22,312 --> 00:46:25,081
[sighs]
What the hell?

732
00:46:27,017 --> 00:46:30,120
Ow. Damn it.

733
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,689
[Jasin]
I didn’t mean to startle you.

734
00:46:32,689 --> 00:46:34,724
And I’m sorry about the pot.

735
00:46:34,724 --> 00:46:38,161
I wasn’t sure
how to get your attention.

736
00:46:38,161 --> 00:46:42,599
Shouldn’t you be in a pile
of dust or something?

737
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:45,802
You’d be surprised
how many myths are false.

738
00:46:45,802 --> 00:46:48,872
Like the myth
about vampires existing?

739
00:46:48,872 --> 00:46:52,242
Yes. Well, I can assure you,
that one is true.

740
00:46:52,242 --> 00:46:54,244
How’s that?

741
00:46:54,244 --> 00:46:56,246
Can we talk?

742
00:46:56,246 --> 00:46:58,982
Do vampires drink coffee?

743
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:01,017
I would love some.

744
00:47:07,891 --> 00:47:10,093
I thought you said
you’d love a cup.

745
00:47:10,093 --> 00:47:12,629
I’m on my third already.

746
00:47:12,629 --> 00:47:14,331
I’m sorry.

747
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:15,999
That is rude of me.

748
00:47:18,134 --> 00:47:20,136
It must be stone-cold by now.

749
00:47:20,136 --> 00:47:22,305
It’s okay.

750
00:47:22,305 --> 00:47:25,475
I really do not need it.

751
00:47:25,475 --> 00:47:27,477
I do not sleep.

752
00:47:27,477 --> 00:47:31,448
Okay. So, let’s say
I believed you.

753
00:47:31,448 --> 00:47:34,150
What is a vampire doing
in California?

754
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:36,553
The sun would destroy you,
wouldn’t it?

755
00:47:39,789 --> 00:47:42,892
As I said earlier,
that’s just a myth.

756
00:47:42,892 --> 00:47:45,862
Only the elder vampires
are affected by the sun.

757
00:47:45,862 --> 00:47:47,564
Elder vampires?

758
00:47:47,564 --> 00:47:49,999
There is so much to tell.

759
00:47:49,999 --> 00:47:51,735
I will get to that.

760
00:47:53,169 --> 00:47:56,206
Well, where are your fangs?

761
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:58,575
What, are you saying
that’s a myth, too?

762
00:47:59,542 --> 00:48:03,813
No. Fangs are a necessity.

763
00:48:03,813 --> 00:48:05,515
Shit.

764
00:48:07,083 --> 00:48:10,653
So, why didn’t you

765
00:48:10,653 --> 00:48:12,555
suck my blood?

766
00:48:12,555 --> 00:48:16,526
I mean, don’t get me wrong.
I’m happy to be alive.

767
00:48:18,128 --> 00:48:19,562
But...

768
00:48:19,562 --> 00:48:21,464
Shall I start
from the beginning?

769
00:48:22,398 --> 00:48:24,534
They say that’s the best place.

770
00:48:25,702 --> 00:48:27,704
I’ll condense
some of the details.

771
00:48:27,704 --> 00:48:29,606
The story is as old as I.

772
00:48:29,606 --> 00:48:31,841
How old are you?

773
00:48:33,009 --> 00:48:35,945
I am forever frozen
at the age of 20.

774
00:48:35,945 --> 00:48:38,715
However, I have walked
the earth as a vampire

775
00:48:38,715 --> 00:48:40,617
for nearly 100 years.

776
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:45,288
I’m all ears.

777
00:48:45,288 --> 00:48:48,525
Uh, nearly 100 years ago,

778
00:48:48,525 --> 00:48:51,528
an elder vampire named Naran

779
00:48:51,528 --> 00:48:54,430
found me near death,

780
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:56,733
lying in a street.

781
00:48:56,733 --> 00:48:59,502
I do not even remember
the city, state

782
00:48:59,502 --> 00:49:01,471
or country I’m from.

783
00:49:01,471 --> 00:49:03,306
I remember his eyes,

784
00:49:03,306 --> 00:49:07,544
and then the pain
of his fangs in my neck.

785
00:49:07,544 --> 00:49:09,412
And the years passed.

786
00:49:09,412 --> 00:49:12,515
He and I were together as one.

787
00:49:12,515 --> 00:49:15,885
He filled my head with stories
of the elder vampires

788
00:49:15,885 --> 00:49:18,788
and their legends.

789
00:49:18,788 --> 00:49:22,425
He taught me everything
about being a vampire.

790
00:49:22,425 --> 00:49:24,828
He taught me to hunt.

791
00:49:34,003 --> 00:49:38,041
And he taught me about love.

792
00:49:45,181 --> 00:49:47,717
Have you--

793
00:49:47,717 --> 00:49:49,953
Have you ever killed?

794
00:49:49,953 --> 00:49:52,989
Another truth among the myths.

795
00:49:54,190 --> 00:49:57,927
Yes, vampires are sustained
by human blood.

796
00:49:57,927 --> 00:50:02,265
We can survive on animals
but only for so long.

797
00:50:02,265 --> 00:50:05,435
You said he taught you
about love.

798
00:50:05,435 --> 00:50:07,503
Yes.

799
00:50:07,503 --> 00:50:10,240
I was Naran’s chosen one.

800
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,208
In order to stay immortal,

801
00:50:12,208 --> 00:50:16,312
an elder must choose
a companion,

802
00:50:16,312 --> 00:50:18,448
another who will complete them.

803
00:50:18,448 --> 00:50:21,050
Like yin and yang,
if you will.

804
00:50:21,951 --> 00:50:24,554
And you were his chosen one.

805
00:50:24,554 --> 00:50:27,156
I was for a time.

806
00:50:27,156 --> 00:50:30,460
As an elder vampire,
Naran would not be satisfied

807
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:32,262
with only one mortal.

808
00:50:32,262 --> 00:50:35,365
Even after he turned me,
he was not fulfilled.

809
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:36,900
He found another

810
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:39,569
and turned her into a vampire.

811
00:50:42,672 --> 00:50:44,374
What happened to him?

812
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:46,175
I have no idea.

813
00:50:46,175 --> 00:50:49,345
He left me in England,
and I have not seen him since.

814
00:50:51,648 --> 00:50:55,752
So, you think I’m
your chosen one?

815
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,054
Yes.

816
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:02,592
See, because I was turned
by an elder,

817
00:51:02,592 --> 00:51:04,827
I must do the same

818
00:51:04,827 --> 00:51:07,664
or I will not survive.

819
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:14,971
But I thought that vampires
were immortal.

820
00:51:14,971 --> 00:51:18,174
I mean, you are over
100 years old.

821
00:51:18,174 --> 00:51:19,976
Very true.

822
00:51:19,976 --> 00:51:22,578
However, without a companion,

823
00:51:22,578 --> 00:51:24,581
upon our 100th vampire year,

824
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:26,683
we cease to exist.

825
00:51:28,151 --> 00:51:30,353
That’s a new one
to add to the list.

826
00:51:30,353 --> 00:51:32,822
Yes. Odd as it is,

827
00:51:32,822 --> 00:51:35,024
it is very true.

828
00:51:35,992 --> 00:51:38,394
What about mirrors?

829
00:51:39,896 --> 00:51:42,932
You think this hair
gets this way on its own?

830
00:51:42,932 --> 00:51:44,767
A mirror does help.

831
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:47,036
- Crosses?
- As you can see,

832
00:51:47,036 --> 00:51:49,672
I’ve always been partial
to their religious significance.

833
00:51:49,672 --> 00:51:51,441
Garlic?

834
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:52,775
Myth.

835
00:51:52,775 --> 00:51:54,777
Stake through the heart?

836
00:51:54,777 --> 00:51:56,679
You saw that a bullet
did not pierce my skin.

837
00:51:56,679 --> 00:52:00,249
Do you really think
a sharpened piece of wood
could do the trick?

838
00:52:00,249 --> 00:52:02,819
Point taken.

839
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:04,621
As for the sun,

840
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:07,890
we hybrids still have
some traces of human blood,

841
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:11,427
so we’re not affected
by its rays.

842
00:52:11,427 --> 00:52:13,463
I don’t make the rules.

843
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:17,500
Dane, Adam, and Logan
are also not affected.

844
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:19,135
I created them.

845
00:52:20,703 --> 00:52:22,905
They’re vampires, too.

846
00:52:23,806 --> 00:52:25,808
We’re a small coven.

847
00:52:25,808 --> 00:52:27,810
I needed companions,

848
00:52:27,810 --> 00:52:29,812
and they have been aiding
in my journey

849
00:52:29,812 --> 00:52:31,514
for my eternal mate.

850
00:52:31,514 --> 00:52:33,416
Pretty tight group.

851
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:37,320
Very much so.

852
00:52:38,421 --> 00:52:39,355
So...

853
00:52:43,292 --> 00:52:45,061
Yes?

854
00:52:46,462 --> 00:52:48,965
How do you kill a vampire?

855
00:52:48,965 --> 00:52:52,535
Why? Do you wanna kill me?

856
00:52:52,535 --> 00:52:54,203
No.

857
00:52:58,307 --> 00:53:03,446
Decapitation
is the only sure way.

858
00:53:05,948 --> 00:53:08,217
Decapitation.

859
00:53:09,419 --> 00:53:11,120
Uh...

860
00:53:12,755 --> 00:53:15,058
So what will happen to me?

861
00:53:15,058 --> 00:53:17,193
Are you going to turn me?

862
00:53:17,193 --> 00:53:21,130
Uh, yes,
it has come to that.

863
00:53:21,130 --> 00:53:24,000
I will not force you.

864
00:53:25,501 --> 00:53:28,471
If you feel for me

865
00:53:28,471 --> 00:53:31,707
the way I feel for you,

866
00:53:31,707 --> 00:53:34,343
you will choose
to be with me forever.

867
00:53:34,343 --> 00:53:36,512
And if not?

868
00:53:38,948 --> 00:53:41,918
Tara is aware of my true self.

869
00:53:41,918 --> 00:53:44,954
She was to be
the one originally.

870
00:53:44,954 --> 00:53:47,757
What happened?

871
00:53:47,757 --> 00:53:51,360
Truth be told,
you happened.

872
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:53,863
I cannot explain it,

873
00:53:53,863 --> 00:53:56,299
but you have this tremendous
pull over me.

874
00:54:05,274 --> 00:54:08,711
So I would become a vampire.

875
00:54:08,711 --> 00:54:11,981
Yes, that is the idea.

876
00:54:15,718 --> 00:54:17,887
This is all too much.

877
00:54:19,122 --> 00:54:21,858
First, Paul goes missing,
and now this.

878
00:54:23,326 --> 00:54:25,561
How long do I have to decide?

879
00:54:25,561 --> 00:54:30,533
My 100th year as a vampire
is tomorrow, midnight.

880
00:54:30,533 --> 00:54:32,335
Are you kidding?

881
00:54:32,335 --> 00:54:34,804
I have to decide
in that short amount of time?

882
00:54:36,005 --> 00:54:38,174
I will not force you
to make any decision

883
00:54:38,174 --> 00:54:40,810
you do not want to.

884
00:54:43,579 --> 00:54:47,617
Look, I am aware
of the weight of all this.

885
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:50,553
That is why I’m giving you
the choice.

886
00:54:50,553 --> 00:54:53,289
The choice I never had.

887
00:54:53,289 --> 00:54:56,926
You truly have no idea
the impact you’ve had on me.

888
00:54:59,262 --> 00:55:01,464
This is all happening
so fast.

889
00:55:02,932 --> 00:55:06,936
Why don’t you take a few hours
to think things over?

890
00:55:06,936 --> 00:55:09,305
I will honor your decision
either way.

891
00:55:11,073 --> 00:55:13,509
A few hours.

892
00:55:14,744 --> 00:55:18,281
I will leave you
to your thoughts.

893
00:55:18,281 --> 00:55:20,683
Wait.

894
00:55:20,683 --> 00:55:23,686
There’s so much to think about.

895
00:55:23,686 --> 00:55:25,822
How...

896
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:27,557
What?

897
00:55:27,557 --> 00:55:31,194
I’m sorry for how quickly
this all came about.

898
00:55:31,194 --> 00:55:34,463
I wish there was more time.

899
00:55:37,967 --> 00:55:40,102
Can I call you tonight?

900
00:55:41,137 --> 00:55:43,406
That would be perfect.

901
00:55:50,546 --> 00:55:52,081
[sighs]

902
00:56:12,134 --> 00:56:14,737
You seem angry about something.

903
00:56:14,737 --> 00:56:16,739
You’re being foolish.

904
00:56:16,739 --> 00:56:18,274
How is that?

905
00:56:18,274 --> 00:56:20,710
You’re not thinking clearly.

906
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:22,712
Tara is the one.

907
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:25,681
I chose her myself.
You were happy with her.

908
00:56:25,681 --> 00:56:29,585
Yes, but my heart
knew differently.

909
00:56:29,585 --> 00:56:32,154
I cannot explain it.

910
00:56:32,154 --> 00:56:34,357
So you’ve said.

911
00:56:34,357 --> 00:56:36,559
You’re being ridiculous.

912
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:40,029
Your time, my time

913
00:56:40,029 --> 00:56:42,131
is almost over.

914
00:56:42,131 --> 00:56:45,134
I’m aware of what could happen.

915
00:56:45,134 --> 00:56:47,937
If Caleb decides
this is too much for him,

916
00:56:47,937 --> 00:56:51,107
I will accept Tara as the one
and turn her tomorrow.

917
00:56:51,107 --> 00:56:52,808
Why can’t you do it now?

918
00:56:52,808 --> 00:56:56,112
Why must you wait
till the last possible minute?

919
00:56:56,112 --> 00:56:58,114
It is my decision.

920
00:56:58,114 --> 00:57:01,117
I am aware
of the ramifications.

921
00:57:01,117 --> 00:57:04,720
We die, too!

922
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:07,990
You know that, right?

923
00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:12,028
This is not just about you.

924
00:57:12,028 --> 00:57:16,565
I think you should calm down.

925
00:57:17,667 --> 00:57:19,802
[Logan]
How am I supposed to calm down

926
00:57:19,802 --> 00:57:21,804
when my life’s in danger?

927
00:57:21,804 --> 00:57:24,073
Caleb is a plaything.

928
00:57:24,073 --> 00:57:27,076
Tara is the one.

929
00:57:27,076 --> 00:57:31,414
Why?
Because you say she is?

930
00:57:34,817 --> 00:57:36,719
[hisses]

931
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:41,991
Are you sure
you wanna go there?

932
00:57:41,991 --> 00:57:44,026
What’s the problem, guys?

933
00:57:44,026 --> 00:57:46,562
I’m not afraid of you.

934
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:51,567
You do not want
to die now, do you?

935
00:57:51,567 --> 00:57:54,236
[chuckling]

936
00:57:54,236 --> 00:57:57,340
Are you threatening me?

937
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:01,610
You initiated this,
and I will gladly finish it.

938
00:58:01,610 --> 00:58:03,612
[hisses]

939
00:58:03,612 --> 00:58:06,482
- Back away.
- Let’s not lose our heads.

940
00:58:06,482 --> 00:58:09,585
Logan, if Caleb is the one
that Jasin wants, let it be.

941
00:58:09,585 --> 00:58:14,890
Jasin is willing to let us die
for a piece of meat.

942
00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:16,492
Break it up.

943
00:58:18,094 --> 00:58:20,496
Now.

944
00:58:26,068 --> 00:58:28,337
This isn’t over.

945
00:58:35,144 --> 00:58:37,913
This can’t be good.

946
00:58:37,913 --> 00:58:40,716
He just needs to calm down.

947
00:58:40,716 --> 00:58:44,019
Do you think he meant it--
it not being over?

948
00:58:44,019 --> 00:58:46,021
Is-- Is he gonna try something?

949
00:58:46,021 --> 00:58:48,524
I cannot be certain.

950
00:58:48,524 --> 00:58:49,525
[answering machine beeps]

951
00:58:49,525 --> 00:58:51,527
Hey, Jasin, it’s Caleb.

952
00:58:51,527 --> 00:58:55,398
Um, I just really
would like to see you.

953
00:58:55,398 --> 00:58:58,501
Can you come over
when you get his?

954
00:59:04,273 --> 00:59:07,343
Did I keep you waiting?

955
00:59:07,343 --> 00:59:09,345
Were you out here
the whole time?

956
00:59:09,345 --> 00:59:11,547
I was across town.

957
00:59:11,547 --> 00:59:12,882
Serious?

958
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:15,351
Another perk of being a vampire.

959
00:59:18,754 --> 00:59:20,356
What’s wrong?

960
00:59:21,424 --> 00:59:23,459
You have to invite me in.

961
00:59:23,459 --> 00:59:26,061
- Really?
- I know.

962
00:59:26,061 --> 00:59:27,930
Another very old vampire myth.

963
00:59:27,930 --> 00:59:31,200
However, it is one of the few
we hybrids must follow.

964
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:34,136
But you were in my backyard.

965
00:59:34,136 --> 00:59:36,906
That was outdoors.

966
00:59:36,906 --> 00:59:39,375
It was not where you live.

967
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:41,243
I don’t make the rules.

968
00:59:42,144 --> 00:59:44,246
I invite you in.

969
00:59:58,561 --> 01:00:02,198
Have you given
any more thought
to our earlier discussion?

970
01:00:02,198 --> 01:00:03,933
I have,

971
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:06,469
but I’ve been
a little distracted.

972
01:00:06,469 --> 01:00:08,471
Paul isn’t answering his phone.

973
01:00:08,471 --> 01:00:10,206
I think he’s ignoring me.

974
01:00:10,206 --> 01:00:12,041
Didn’t you two have a fight?

975
01:00:12,041 --> 01:00:13,843
You could say that,

976
01:00:13,843 --> 01:00:16,278
but it seems
a little unlike him.

977
01:00:17,513 --> 01:00:19,482
You haven’t known him that long.

978
01:00:19,482 --> 01:00:21,417
Maybe it is just like him.

979
01:00:23,752 --> 01:00:28,157
So, about our
earlier conversation.

980
01:00:29,425 --> 01:00:32,294
There’s just so much
to consider.

981
01:00:33,529 --> 01:00:36,432
What are your feelings
for me?

982
01:00:36,432 --> 01:00:38,434
It’s funny.

983
01:00:38,434 --> 01:00:40,836
I’ve never felt this way
about anyone,

984
01:00:40,836 --> 01:00:42,838
ever.

985
01:00:42,838 --> 01:00:44,673
I feel the same.

986
01:00:46,308 --> 01:00:48,544
What about Tara?

987
01:00:48,544 --> 01:00:52,681
If she truly were the one,
I would not be here right now.

988
01:00:58,420 --> 01:01:00,956
Would you give yourself
to me freely?

989
01:01:03,225 --> 01:01:04,693
I...

990
01:01:04,693 --> 01:01:06,295
[knock at door]

991
01:01:13,402 --> 01:01:15,871
What’s going on?

992
01:01:15,871 --> 01:01:18,440
- Big trouble.
- That’s putting it mildly.

993
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:20,109
What are you both talking about?

994
01:01:20,109 --> 01:01:21,710
Logan has completely lost it.

995
01:01:21,710 --> 01:01:24,547
- What’s going on?
- Hey, Caleb.

996
01:01:24,547 --> 01:01:27,416
- So, ready to become one of us?
- Stay focused, Dane.

997
01:01:27,416 --> 01:01:30,653
- What has happened?
What’s Logan done?
- Logan has taken Tara.

998
01:01:30,653 --> 01:01:33,522
He sent us to find you.
If you don’t meet him
tonight in the meadow,

999
01:01:33,522 --> 01:01:36,792
he’s gonna kill her,
and he’s gonna hunt you down
and kill you, too.

1000
01:01:36,792 --> 01:01:38,727
What? Wait.

1001
01:01:38,727 --> 01:01:40,663
No. Sorry, man. We don’t have
enough time to explain.

1002
01:01:40,663 --> 01:01:42,598
Oh, you should’ve seen him.

1003
01:01:42,598 --> 01:01:47,469
We couldn’t stop him.
He’s more powerful
than either of us.

1004
01:01:47,469 --> 01:01:49,905
May they come in?

1005
01:01:49,905 --> 01:01:53,776
Yes, of course.
You can both come in.

1006
01:01:55,711 --> 01:01:59,248
- Logan has taken this too far.
- You should’ve seen
the look in his eyes.

1007
01:01:59,248 --> 01:02:02,585
- Oh, darker than normal.
- I will not fight him
unless I must.

1008
01:02:02,585 --> 01:02:04,720
I cannot let him harm Tara.

1009
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:08,257
Is he more powerful than you?
I don’t wanna lose you.

1010
01:02:08,257 --> 01:02:10,259
I created Logan.

1011
01:02:10,259 --> 01:02:12,194
He was my first transformation.

1012
01:02:12,194 --> 01:02:14,163
He is a very powerful vampire.

1013
01:02:14,163 --> 01:02:17,166
- He threw Adam through a tree.
- It didn’t hurt.

1014
01:02:17,166 --> 01:02:19,635
Stay focused, guys.

1015
01:02:19,635 --> 01:02:22,671
If he wants me to meet him,
so be it.

1016
01:02:22,671 --> 01:02:24,673
You must stay behind.

1017
01:02:24,673 --> 01:02:27,409
Bullshit.
I’m not staying here.

1018
01:02:27,409 --> 01:02:29,345
You are a stubborn one,
aren’t you?

1019
01:02:29,345 --> 01:02:31,714
Damn straight.
I don’t wanna lose you.

1020
01:02:31,714 --> 01:02:33,315
Don’t worry, Jasin.

1021
01:02:33,315 --> 01:02:35,751
We’ll help protect him.

1022
01:02:35,751 --> 01:02:38,153
If we don’t die
in the process.

1023
01:02:38,153 --> 01:02:41,090
I do not think that Logan
means to hurt Tara.

1024
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:43,459
It is more than likely
a plot to get Caleb.

1025
01:02:43,459 --> 01:02:45,461
Caleb is the true target.

1026
01:02:45,461 --> 01:02:47,062
You must stay here.

1027
01:02:50,966 --> 01:02:52,901
So be it.

1028
01:03:01,710 --> 01:03:03,545
[crying]

1029
01:03:08,751 --> 01:03:10,719
It does not have
to be this way.

1030
01:03:13,222 --> 01:03:15,090
Look what you did.

1031
01:03:20,295 --> 01:03:22,297
Poor Tara.

1032
01:03:22,297 --> 01:03:24,366
She’s heartbroken.

1033
01:03:25,934 --> 01:03:29,605
I think she’s more frightened
of you at the moment.

1034
01:03:29,605 --> 01:03:32,608
I don’t wanna die.
[crying]

1035
01:03:35,077 --> 01:03:36,879
How can you choose him...

1036
01:03:39,181 --> 01:03:41,750
...over her?

1037
01:03:43,419 --> 01:03:48,457
She’s so perfect and beautiful.

1038
01:03:51,593 --> 01:03:54,596
I can smell her blood.

1039
01:03:54,596 --> 01:03:56,732
It’s so sweet.

1040
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:00,436
Maybe I’ll drain her
right here...

1041
01:04:02,504 --> 01:04:04,506
before I kill him.

1042
01:04:04,506 --> 01:04:06,675
Try to stay calm, Tara.
He will not harm you.

1043
01:04:06,675 --> 01:04:08,911
Don’t count on it.

1044
01:04:08,911 --> 01:04:10,379
[grunting]

1045
01:04:19,388 --> 01:04:20,889
[panting]

1046
01:04:22,925 --> 01:04:25,227
I don’t want to kill you.

1047
01:04:25,227 --> 01:04:27,563
You don’t have a choice.

1048
01:04:27,563 --> 01:04:30,466
Either you kill me

1049
01:04:30,466 --> 01:04:33,068
or I’ll kill him.

1050
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:37,473
Then I’ll burn your body.

1051
01:04:39,007 --> 01:04:41,076
[yells]

1052
01:04:44,246 --> 01:04:48,984
You caused this!
You caused this!

1053
01:04:48,984 --> 01:04:50,452
[grunts]

1054
01:04:50,452 --> 01:04:53,522
You leave me no choice.

1055
01:04:59,928 --> 01:05:03,132
[grunting]

1056
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:17,713
Is she gonna be okay?

1057
01:05:22,785 --> 01:05:25,120
Her heartbeat is slowing.

1058
01:05:26,722 --> 01:05:29,458
She will be one of us
before the night is over.

1059
01:05:34,296 --> 01:05:36,231
Can I say the same for you?

1060
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:40,269
As you can see,

1061
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:42,604
I will do anything for you.

1062
01:05:45,741 --> 01:05:49,578
Will you die to live forever?

1063
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:56,151
Will you die
