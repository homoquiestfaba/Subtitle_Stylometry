00:10:16,432 --> 00:10:19,134

or Mr. Nero's.

191
00:10:25,141 --> 00:10:27,810
That is, if he
doesn't screw it up

192
00:10:27,811 --> 00:10:30,012
between now and then.

193
00:10:30,013 --> 00:10:32,114
We catch you tickling
Mr. Nero's wife

194

195

all bets are off.

196
00:10:38,922 --> 00:10:40,255
Slim chance.

197
00:10:40,256 --> 00:10:42,491

201
00:10:50,867 --> 00:10:52,034
What?

202
00:10:52,035 --> 00:10:54,069
How are you, sir?

203
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,373
Oh, yes. I'm eating
solid food again.

204

I only have
a minute, Carol.

210
00:11:32,508 --> 00:11:34,209
Got to take a taxi.

211
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,544
How's everything
going in there?

212
00:11:35,545 --> 00:11:37,579
They just put in
the new windows.

213
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,281
Everything will
be ready today.

214
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:41,050

Today's mail.

219
00:11:47,023 --> 00:11:48,458
Nothing
super important.

220

Going a little fast,

226
00:12:35,872 --> 00:12:38,473
The road is that way.

227
00:12:38,474 --> 00:12:40,042

Ow!

232
00:12:58,394 --> 00:13:01,030
Do you accept
the lord Satan

233
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:02,531
as the supreme being

234
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:05,434
and evil,
your salvation?

235
00:13:05,435 --> 00:13:08,170
I've been meaning to,
but I've been so busy,

236
00:13:08,171 --> 00:13:09,972
I haven't
gotten around to it.

00:13:37,934 --> 00:13:39,969
Do you worship Satan?

245
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:43,072
How much do you want
to stop this cab?

246
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:44,940

I'll throw in the wallet.
It's from Gucci.

all your friends in hell.

Hey!

256
00:14:05,962 --> 00:14:08,964
Do you worship Satan?

257
00:14:08,965 --> 00:14:10,099
Worship him?

258
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,700
I am Satan!

Don't drive
another inch.

your problem is at home,

to work with that attitude!

No!

It isn't
really a Gucci!

No. Wait! There's
another person.

00:17:02,272 --> 00:17:04,539
It was
the cab driver.

Hey! You are doing
this intentionally.

You know I'll
have you reported

301

for urinating on
an accident victim!

302
00:17:32,568 --> 00:17:34,936
Is this any kind
of behavior

303
00:17:34,937 --> 00:17:36,605
for a patrolman?

00:20:12,695 --> 00:20:14,463
It must be based

on some sort
of optical
illusion.

And would you
stop it, daddy?

You're
scaring Amanda.

00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:32,848
What?

368
00:20:35,385 --> 00:20:36,686
What?

369
00:20:38,788 --> 00:20:40,121
Daddy,

370
00:20:40,122 --> 00:20:41,724

on it, actually.

Well, of course
I can send you back,

should I want to?

not Thursday.

make it to Thursday.

514
00:27:51,153 --> 00:27:55,056
But on... on the book,
it's spelled Edith.

515
00:27:55,057 --> 00:27:56,991
But it's pronounced
eh-dith.

516

Look, it is not
a girl's name.

518

Eh-dith
is a boy's name!

named after?

called her eh-dith?

No! Her name is Edith!

523

525
00:28:13,876 --> 00:28:15,978
No, it's not!

526
00:28:17,012 --> 00:28:20,949

please stand still?

00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:22,483

to send me back.

want to disappoint
my children again!

I'll send you back,

531
00:28:32,194 --> 00:28:34,328

further readings.

get this landing down.

00:29:48,037 --> 00:29:50,171
I was in London

551
00:29:50,172 --> 00:29:53,242
with a man named Edith.

552
00:29:54,643 --> 00:29:56,577
That's a girl's name.

553
00:29:56,578 --> 00:30:00,348
Daddy, can I take you
to show and tell?

554
00:30:00,349 --> 00:30:02,516
No, honey. You can't
take me anywhere,

555
00:30:02,517 --> 00:30:04,318
and if anyone asks,

556
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:08,990
you say everything
is perfectly normal, o.K.?

557
00:30:08,991 --> 00:30:10,358
O.k.

558
00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:12,526
We have to hold out
until Thursday.

559
00:30:12,527 --> 00:30:14,595
[Telephone rings]

560
00:30:14,596 --> 00:30:18,332
Obviously I can't
go into the office
like this.

561
00:30:18,333 --> 00:30:19,600
Hello.

562
00:30:19,601 --> 00:30:23,604
Just tell them that,
uh, I'm not well.

563
00:30:23,605 --> 00:30:25,173
That's great.

564
00:30:25,174 --> 00:30:28,076
Just tell them
that I'm not well,

565
00:30:28,077 --> 00:30:30,578
and I'll stay here
right on through Thursday,

566
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:33,081
and then after Thursday,
you see...

567
00:30:33,082 --> 00:30:34,382
It's Mr. Collins
for you,

568
00:30:34,383 --> 00:30:37,152
and he sounds
kind of flipped out.

569
00:30:42,224 --> 00:30:43,458
Concentrate, dad.

570
00:30:52,634 --> 00:30:54,668
Mr. Collins?

571
00:30:54,669 --> 00:30:57,238
Why weren't you
at the bank meeting?

572
00:30:57,239 --> 00:30:58,706
This merger
is falling apart!

573
00:30:58,707 --> 00:31:00,674
Where have you been
all afternoon?

574
00:31:00,675 --> 00:31:03,311
We've had negotiating committees
from both firms waiting,

575
00:31:03,312 --> 00:31:05,346
and you never
had the courtesy

576
00:31:05,347 --> 00:31:07,648
to tell US
you were standing US up.

577
00:31:07,649 --> 00:31:10,151
Yes, well, Mr. Collins,
I can assure you...

578
00:31:10,152 --> 00:31:11,719
If you blow this deal,

579
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:15,456
do you know what I
personally will do to you?

[Click]

581
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:27,336
How am I going
to go to work?

582
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:58,399
Are you going
to bed soon?

583
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,301
No.

584
00:32:00,302 --> 00:32:02,671
Aren't you tired?

585
00:32:04,373 --> 00:32:07,376
Uh, I don't think
ghosts get tired.

586
00:32:09,478 --> 00:32:12,080
Are you just going
to sit up all night?

587
00:32:12,081 --> 00:32:14,382
Well,
I'm a ghost.
It's my job.

588
00:32:14,383 --> 00:32:15,749
Speaking of jobs, daddy,

589
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:19,153
do you think you can
go to work like this?

590
00:32:19,154 --> 00:32:20,522
Who are you kidding?

591
00:32:23,558 --> 00:32:26,295
I never said
that it would be easy.

592
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:29,730
I... I... I truly believe,
though,

593
00:32:29,731 --> 00:32:32,333
that if we
pull together

594
00:32:32,334 --> 00:32:34,169
and if I...

595
00:32:35,337 --> 00:32:40,574
Just concentrate
hard enough,

596
00:32:40,575 --> 00:32:46,080
and we can
stick to the plan

597
00:32:46,081 --> 00:32:48,749
for tomorrow,

598
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:52,221
people will not know...

599
00:32:53,355 --> 00:32:59,327
I'm, uh... what I am.

600
00:32:59,328 --> 00:33:02,763
And if you don't,
what happens to US?

00:33:02,764 --> 00:33:06,567
How am I going
to support myself
and two kids?

602

Have you
left US anything?

603
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:11,706
You don't have
life insurance?

604
00:33:12,841 --> 00:33:14,442
This house.

605
00:33:14,443 --> 00:33:16,278
Do we
own this house?

606
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,248
Why did you
leave everything

607
00:33:20,249 --> 00:33:21,682
till
the last minute?

608

[Chuckling]

609
00:33:24,386 --> 00:33:27,188
I didn't know
it was the last minute.

610
00:33:27,189 --> 00:33:30,291
I had life insurance,

611
00:33:30,292 --> 00:33:33,194
and then
your mother got sick,

612
00:33:33,195 --> 00:33:35,196
and I cashed it in
to pay the medical bills.

613
00:33:35,197 --> 00:33:37,365
I mortgaged the house.

614
00:33:37,366 --> 00:33:40,735
Anything
to try and save her.

615
00:33:43,872 --> 00:33:46,707
I'm sorry, daddy.

616
00:33:46,708 --> 00:33:49,244
To Thursday.

617
00:33:54,416 --> 00:33:57,219
We're screwed.

618
00:34:03,758 --> 00:34:05,826
There's no way
this is going to work.

619
00:34:05,827 --> 00:34:07,761
Hi, kids.
Where's your dad?

620
00:34:07,762 --> 00:34:09,463
Everybody's been
looking for him.

621
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:11,332
Maybe he's dead.

00:34:11,333 --> 00:34:12,501

00:34:14,769 --> 00:34:16,304
Or maybe he drowned.

see my dad anywhere?

Oh, my god.

00:34:48,603 --> 00:34:51,339
You scared the dickens
out of me.

00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,606
Don't ever
do that again.

is furious with you.

a long story.

what are they doing?

00:35:02,751 --> 00:35:05,519
Uh, they're
shutting out the light

642
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,521
because I don't
like the sunlight.

643
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,490
Uh, you always
loved the sunlight.

644
00:35:09,491 --> 00:35:10,858
I'm talking
about the fact

645
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:12,593
that I want
to concentrate,

646
00:35:12,594 --> 00:35:14,863
and the view
and the sunshine,
it's distracting.

647

I'll get a number.

653
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,714
Collins wants you to handle
all the negotiating sessions.

He says the Australians
are getting edgy.

from yesterday to today,

we have to do,

for outside appointments.

Oh, I forgot to tell you.

667
00:36:06,681 --> 00:36:10,651
You have to take
your life insurance physical
this afternoon.

668
00:36:10,652 --> 00:36:13,487
Can't they give me the insurance
without the physical?

669
00:36:13,488 --> 00:36:16,590
No. They said it's today
or never.

right here.

so worried about?

finds out
that you're dead?

finds your body?

Yo, Diane. Let me in.
I need a ride.

on backwards?

and do not
embarrass me.

letting him in...

Thanks a lot, babe.

your friend Diane," right?

know you liked me.

Let me
tell you something.

You are never, never,
ever going to date that...

A good thing
about being a ghost

is lights on, lights off,
I'm still here.

can be such jerks.

this is Tony.

what happened to him.

have you been?

I take out the garbage.

00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:29,242
I know I can't.

910
00:50:29,243 --> 00:50:31,745
Oh, well.
[Laughs]

911
00:50:33,214 --> 00:50:35,915
Oh, no. No, no, no.
I don't mean that.

912
00:50:35,916 --> 00:50:38,918
I-I can...
Of course I... what did...

913
00:50:38,919 --> 00:50:41,688
Well?
What I mean is,
we can't.

914
00:50:41,689 --> 00:50:43,556
We can't.
Shh.

915
00:50:43,557 --> 00:50:46,493
Now, it's just a little
performance anxiety, see.

916
00:50:46,494 --> 00:50:49,162
But you don't have to
perform with me,

917
00:50:49,163 --> 00:50:52,833
'cause all we're
gonna do is cuddle.

918
00:50:54,735 --> 00:50:57,270
But I have people wait...
Ooh.

919
00:50:57,271 --> 00:51:01,308
You just need to relax.

920
00:51:01,309 --> 00:51:04,311
I gotta go.

921
00:51:04,312 --> 00:51:06,514
I've got to concentrate.

922
00:51:12,186 --> 00:51:13,920
Are the guys
still here?

923
00:51:13,921 --> 00:51:16,723
Yeah. Diane won't
come out of her room.

924
00:51:16,724 --> 00:51:19,592
I need to talk
to you about school...

925
00:51:19,593 --> 00:51:23,264
Just let me deal
with my boss first.

926
00:51:24,465 --> 00:51:27,200
Gentlemen, here are
the final documents,

927
00:51:27,201 --> 00:51:29,536
and I spent
the whole time

928
00:51:29,537 --> 00:51:31,371
working right here
on them,

929
00:51:31,372 --> 00:51:34,407
and I'm sure
that we will be able

930
00:51:34,408 --> 00:51:35,942
to resolve
any final disagreements

931
00:51:35,943 --> 00:51:37,477

Mr. Hopper,
it's Stuart.

00:51:56,630 --> 00:51:58,798
You know.
Danny's friend,

Yes, Stuart.
I'll get Danny
for you.

00:52:03,571 --> 00:52:06,339
No, no. It's you
I want to talk to.

that you're an alien.

excuse me one minute.

you little bag
of pig puke!

952
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:52,285
You mention one thing
to anybody about this,

953
00:52:52,286 --> 00:52:53,686
and so help me,

954
00:52:53,687 --> 00:52:55,688
I'll do things to you

955

even imagine!

00:53:01,829 --> 00:53:03,363
I don't get frightened.

00:53:03,364 --> 00:53:05,665

Aah! Aah!

have some time?

966
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:34,561
Where did they go?

967
00:53:34,562 --> 00:53:35,628
They left.

968
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:37,029
What did they say?

969
00:53:37,030 --> 00:53:38,531
They seemed
pretty torqued off.

970
00:53:38,532 --> 00:53:41,434
Look, dad,
I've got this problem.

971
00:53:41,435 --> 00:53:43,770
Tomorrow is career day
at school.

the same old tricks.

other things
in this world

on the phone?

Put the bitch
on the phone?

The bitch can't
make it to the phone.

I'm here, though.

00:54:31,385 --> 00:54:34,020

so much as call,

990
00:54:34,021 --> 00:54:36,022
talk to,

about Diane,

my daughter alone.

you wanted?

1002
00:55:34,848 --> 00:55:35,848
Forget it.

1003
00:55:35,849 --> 00:55:37,216

couldn't do that trick

I'm sure it's not.

rely on dad,

to himself

1037

he's a man
on his own.

seen anything...

Do you think you can
set it up again, maybe?

1041

to Rupert.

a little strange.

issues remaining...

of the pre-merger
capital gains

1053
00:58:42,703 --> 00:58:45,304
and the distribution
of combined partnership
holdings

1054
00:58:45,305 --> 00:58:46,939
in subchapter three...

1055
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:48,908
Excuse me, Elliot.
It's Diane.

1056
00:58:48,909 --> 00:58:50,744
She says it's about Danny.

to her right now.

the pretax escrow account
for the new partnership.

01:01:08,882 --> 01:01:10,150
Say, you've
gained weight.

1079
01:01:17,157 --> 01:01:19,792
I thought you had
that big meeting.

1080
01:01:19,793 --> 01:01:21,894
Yeah, I did,
but I thought about it,

1081
01:01:21,895 --> 01:01:22,995
and you're more important.

1082
01:01:22,996 --> 01:01:23,897

of this in a second,

then we'll have
a big finish.

1085
01:01:31,071 --> 01:01:32,204
All right.

1086
01:01:32,205 --> 01:01:33,073
You got it.

1087
01:02:06,006 --> 01:02:07,941
Aah!

1088
01:02:19,586 --> 01:02:21,454
Oh, wow!

1089
01:02:25,192 --> 01:02:26,559
How am I doing?

1090
01:02:27,861 --> 01:02:29,261
You're getting an "a."

1091
01:02:29,262 --> 01:02:31,031
Thank you.

1092
01:02:56,089 --> 01:02:59,927
Dad, you're the greatest.

1093
01:03:01,328 --> 01:03:04,296
To call your
behavior incompetent

1094
01:03:04,297 --> 01:03:08,000
would be like calling
world war ii a spat!

1095
01:03:08,001 --> 01:03:11,203
I could tear you apart
with my bare hands!

1096
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:12,471
He's a little upset.

1097
01:03:12,472 --> 01:03:14,173
I cannot believe

1098
01:03:14,174 --> 01:03:16,142
you would walk out
of negotiations

1099
01:03:16,143 --> 01:03:18,010
just when we are
closing them.

1100
01:03:18,011 --> 01:03:20,079
I'm sure you had
an excellent reason.

1101
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:22,648
If I hadn't stepped in,
it would've fallen through.

1102
01:03:22,649 --> 01:03:24,483
I would have killed you.

1103
01:03:24,484 --> 01:03:27,186
We closed it.
He doesn't have
to kill you now.

1104
01:03:27,187 --> 01:03:28,620
Instead,
I'll ruin you.

1105
01:03:28,621 --> 01:03:30,422
I told you about this.

1106
01:03:30,423 --> 01:03:31,423
You're fired.

1107
01:03:31,424 --> 01:03:32,925
Mr. Collins...

1108
01:03:32,926 --> 01:03:34,593
You're fired!

1109
01:03:34,594 --> 01:03:36,595
You walked out
on a meeting.

1110
01:03:36,596 --> 01:03:38,464
No, I can explain.

1111
01:03:38,465 --> 01:03:40,067
You're fired!

1112
01:03:41,301 --> 01:03:43,335
This is not for me.

1113
01:03:43,336 --> 01:03:45,337
This is for my children.

1114
01:03:45,338 --> 01:03:47,940
Their whole future depends
on this, Mr. Collins.

1115
01:03:47,941 --> 01:03:50,409
I can't lose my job now.

1116
01:03:50,410 --> 01:03:53,012
I've served
your company 14 years.

1117
01:03:53,013 --> 01:03:54,713
I've served you well
and loyally,

1118
01:03:54,714 --> 01:03:57,284
and that's got to count
for something.

1119
01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:08,460
You're fired.

1120
01:04:08,461 --> 01:04:11,230
Mr. Collins...

1121
01:04:11,231 --> 01:04:13,232
Mr. Collins...

1122
01:04:13,233 --> 01:04:15,568
Don't come
to the banquet.

1123
01:04:35,355 --> 01:04:36,689
Elliot!

1124
01:04:40,327 --> 01:04:42,728
Elliot, you're not
even dressed yet.

1125
01:04:42,729 --> 01:04:45,198
I thought
the banquet
is at 7:30.

1126
01:04:47,034 --> 01:04:51,037
It's the worst moment
of... of my life.

1127
01:04:51,038 --> 01:04:54,374
I... I'm sorry, Joan.
I can't talk to you
right now.

1128
01:04:57,377 --> 01:04:58,678
Wh...

1129
01:05:13,293 --> 01:05:16,762
I'm afraid
I have bad news.

1130
01:05:16,763 --> 01:05:18,665
You're fired.

1131
01:05:34,614 --> 01:05:38,085
I'm sorry about the job.

1132
01:05:41,821 --> 01:05:44,391
But I'm very sorry...

1133
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:50,097
About the job...

1134
01:05:51,131 --> 01:05:54,667
That I couldn't finish.

1135
01:05:56,603 --> 01:05:59,205
I don't care
about the stupid job.

1136
01:05:59,206 --> 01:06:00,739
When you were alive,

1137
01:06:00,740 --> 01:06:04,077
you wouldn't have left
the meeting to help me.

1138
01:06:06,613 --> 01:06:07,779
[Door slams]

1139
01:06:07,780 --> 01:06:09,781
Elliot, I don't know
what's happening,

1140
01:06:09,782 --> 01:06:11,750
but we're having
this out now.

1141
01:06:11,751 --> 01:06:13,286
Go ahead.

1142
01:06:17,757 --> 01:06:20,326
Why is it
all of a sudden

1143
01:06:20,327 --> 01:06:22,361
always so dark
around here?

1144
01:06:22,362 --> 01:06:24,796
And how can you fall
through a bed?

1145
01:06:24,797 --> 01:06:26,565
Why are you
talking so funny?

1146
01:06:26,566 --> 01:06:28,368
What is wrong
with your clothes?

1147
01:06:29,536 --> 01:06:32,504
Everything's
perfectly normal.

1148
01:06:32,505 --> 01:06:34,174
Joan...

1149
01:06:35,608 --> 01:06:37,176
I'm dead.

1150
01:06:37,177 --> 01:06:38,845
I... I'm a ghost.

1151
01:06:41,114 --> 01:06:43,383
I'm no longer living.

1152
01:06:45,252 --> 01:06:47,187
This is
a joke, right?

1153
01:06:54,794 --> 01:06:57,197
Aah!

1154
01:07:00,467 --> 01:07:01,800
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

1155
01:07:01,801 --> 01:07:03,503
Aah!

1156
01:07:06,306 --> 01:07:08,807
I thought you were
afraid of intimacy.

1157
01:07:08,808 --> 01:07:11,343
I didn't know
you were deceased.

1158
01:07:11,344 --> 01:07:13,146
Actually,
I fear you're not.

1159
01:07:14,247 --> 01:07:17,850
I fear you're not.
You're not deceased.

1160
01:07:18,818 --> 01:07:20,652
I'm not deceased?

1161
01:07:20,653 --> 01:07:23,155
I did some calculations
on your measurements.

1162
01:07:23,156 --> 01:07:24,490
You're not a ghost.

1163
01:07:24,491 --> 01:07:27,260
I'm not deceased?

1164
01:07:28,361 --> 01:07:29,828
What am I?

1165
01:07:29,829 --> 01:07:33,199
You're a spirit, all right,
but not a ghost.

1166
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:35,167
Not yet. Now,
where's the kitchen?

1167
01:07:35,168 --> 01:07:38,170
I am famished! Ah!

1168
01:07:38,171 --> 01:07:41,540
Can we get back
to the "I'm not
deceased"?

1169
01:07:41,541 --> 01:07:43,175
Yes. You didn't die.

1170
01:07:43,176 --> 01:07:45,411
You jumped out
of your body.

1171
01:07:45,412 --> 01:07:46,645
Something
frightened you, yes?

1172
01:07:46,646 --> 01:07:47,879
Something very
dangerous happened,

1173
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:49,381
and it frightened you.

1174
01:07:49,382 --> 01:07:50,849
I was in
the taxicab.

1175
01:07:50,850 --> 01:07:52,418
It went off
the bridge.

1176
01:07:52,419 --> 01:07:54,753
It landed underneath
the water.
I couldn't breathe.

1177
01:07:54,754 --> 01:07:56,788
I couldn't get out.

1178
01:07:56,789 --> 01:07:58,790
Oh, no. You drowned?

1179
01:07:58,791 --> 01:07:59,825
Yes.

1180
01:07:59,826 --> 01:08:01,393
Ah, but he didn't.

1181
01:08:01,394 --> 01:08:03,829
You got scared out
of your body.

1182
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:07,299
Your corpus humanum
is still alive somewhere!

1183
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:08,967
It's been rumored
there was one other case

1184
01:08:08,968 --> 01:08:10,569
in america years ago,

1185
01:08:10,570 --> 01:08:12,338
in the 1940s, I think.

1186
01:08:12,339 --> 01:08:14,473
Before he found his body,

1187
01:08:14,474 --> 01:08:15,774
this poor fellow

1188
01:08:15,775 --> 01:08:18,477
had to wear
a bunny costume
for a week.

1189
01:08:18,478 --> 01:08:21,713
It was somewhere
in Minnesota, I think.

1190
01:08:21,714 --> 01:08:24,616
That was my father.

1191
01:08:24,617 --> 01:08:29,288
Ah! I've always
suspected this was
an hereditary trait.

1192
01:08:29,289 --> 01:08:31,990
Far out! When do
I get to do it?

1193
01:08:31,991 --> 01:08:33,892
First things first,
young man.

1194
01:08:33,893 --> 01:08:36,495
Your father's got a body
out there somewhere.

1195
01:08:36,496 --> 01:08:39,565
We should find it before
it checks out for good.

1196
01:08:39,566 --> 01:08:40,666
Call the hospitals.

1197
01:08:40,667 --> 01:08:42,234
I'll call the police.

1198
01:08:42,235 --> 01:08:43,635
I'll call
the cab companies.

1199
01:08:43,636 --> 01:08:45,305
There's a phone
upstairs.

1200
01:08:49,242 --> 01:08:50,809
Who are you?

1201
01:08:50,810 --> 01:08:53,945
Oh, I'm very sorry.
My card.

1202
01:08:53,946 --> 01:08:56,315
"Edith"? But that's
a girl's name.

1203
01:08:56,316 --> 01:08:59,451
I beg to differ.
It's not
a girl's name.

1204
01:08:59,452 --> 01:09:01,853
Well, all the ediths
I know are girls.

1205
01:09:01,854 --> 01:09:03,523
Eh-dith
is a boy's name.

1206
01:09:04,824 --> 01:09:07,726
Yes, sergeant.
Thank you.

1207
01:09:07,727 --> 01:09:09,261
Nothing from the police.

1208
01:09:09,262 --> 01:09:11,563
The hospital doesn't
have you, either.

1209
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:13,632
They've got
the cab driver...
Curtis burch.

1210
01:09:13,633 --> 01:09:14,666
He's alive?

1211
01:09:14,667 --> 01:09:17,469
In a coma.
Somebody up there
likes him.

1212
01:09:17,470 --> 01:09:19,305
Somebody up there
doesn't know him.

1213
01:09:19,306 --> 01:09:21,407
If my body is alive,

1214
01:09:21,408 --> 01:09:23,409
it means I'm not
underwater.

1215
01:09:23,410 --> 01:09:25,477
They found
the cab driver.

1216
01:09:25,478 --> 01:09:26,945
They didn't
find my body.

1217
01:09:26,946 --> 01:09:30,816
I must be somewhere
near him washed ashore.

1218
01:09:30,817 --> 01:09:33,785
Remember where?
We could search
the riverbank.

1219
01:09:33,786 --> 01:09:36,389
Get Diane. Let's go.

1220
01:09:38,725 --> 01:09:40,626
Diane! Diane!

1221
01:09:40,627 --> 01:09:43,295
Hurry! Diane, come on!

1222
01:09:43,296 --> 01:09:44,830
Let's go!

1223
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:47,833
Hurry up! We got to
search for dad's body.

1224
01:09:47,834 --> 01:09:49,701
Aah!

1225
01:09:49,702 --> 01:09:51,404
[Crash]

1226
01:09:56,443 --> 01:09:57,710
Baby!

1227
01:10:21,868 --> 01:10:24,069
Coming through.

1228
01:10:24,070 --> 01:10:26,838
Get the straps off.
We're ready.

1229
01:10:26,839 --> 01:10:28,707
1, 2, 3...

1230
01:10:28,708 --> 01:10:29,775
Lift.

1231
01:10:29,776 --> 01:10:32,344
Good, good.

1232
01:10:32,345 --> 01:10:34,012
O.k., what
have we got?

1233
01:10:34,013 --> 01:10:35,647
She fell.

1234
01:10:35,648 --> 01:10:37,616
150. BP...
80 over 30.

1235
01:10:37,617 --> 01:10:39,084
Pupils fixed
and dilated.

1236
01:10:39,085 --> 01:10:40,752
Doctor, her blood pressure's
dropping. We're losing her.

1237
01:10:40,753 --> 01:10:42,020
Come on! Move it!

1238
01:10:42,021 --> 01:10:43,556
EKG hooked up.

1239
01:10:45,458 --> 01:10:46,758
Boo!

1240
01:10:46,759 --> 01:10:48,027
Diane.

1241
01:10:50,763 --> 01:10:52,398
What are you doing?

1242
01:10:52,399 --> 01:10:55,402
Taking after
my old man, I guess.

1243
01:11:05,745 --> 01:11:07,380
Diane.

1244
01:11:15,121 --> 01:11:17,656
Diane,
stop fooling around

1245
01:11:17,657 --> 01:11:19,925
and get back
in your body.

1246
01:11:19,926 --> 01:11:20,992
No way.

1247
01:11:20,993 --> 01:11:24,464
This is great!

1248
01:11:28,668 --> 01:11:29,668
Diane,

1249
01:11:29,669 --> 01:11:31,803
get back
into your body

1250
01:11:31,804 --> 01:11:33,639
before something
serious happens.

1251
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:36,408
Like what?
Don't do this to me.

1252
01:11:36,409 --> 01:11:38,544
It's always about you,
isn't it?

1253
01:11:38,545 --> 01:11:40,579
I'm thinking
of me right now.

1254
01:11:40,580 --> 01:11:43,415
This ghost life is better
than my crappy life.

1255
01:11:43,416 --> 01:11:45,584
I'm not going
back to it.

1256
01:11:45,585 --> 01:11:50,088
Diane, life is
all there is.

1257
01:11:50,089 --> 01:11:51,758
Believe me.

1258
01:11:55,428 --> 01:11:57,829
I'm begging you,

1259
01:11:57,830 --> 01:12:00,500
don't waste it.

1260
01:12:01,568 --> 01:12:02,802
Daddy?

1261
01:12:06,138 --> 01:12:07,774
Oh, my god.

1262
01:12:13,613 --> 01:12:15,548
What... what's happening
to you?

1263
01:12:16,716 --> 01:12:18,084
Diane...

1264
01:12:22,121 --> 01:12:24,122
Now...

1265
01:12:24,123 --> 01:12:25,825
Here...

1266
01:12:27,193 --> 01:12:28,861
Don't waste it.

1267
01:12:30,597 --> 01:12:33,765
Shouldn't we try
to find your body?

1268
01:12:33,766 --> 01:12:35,734
It's not important.

1269
01:12:35,735 --> 01:12:37,703
It's you.

1270
01:12:37,704 --> 01:12:39,572
Please,
I'll help you look.

1271
01:12:40,740 --> 01:12:43,742
I'm not
doing anything

1272
01:12:43,743 --> 01:12:49,581
until you get back
into yours.

1273
01:12:49,582 --> 01:12:52,719
Daddy, why won't you
let me help you?

1274
01:12:53,853 --> 01:12:57,657
I want you...

1275
01:12:59,492 --> 01:13:02,228
To live...

1276
01:13:08,968 --> 01:13:10,570
Because...

1277
01:13:16,175 --> 01:13:17,877
I...

1278
01:13:20,212 --> 01:13:23,182
Because you love me.

1279
01:13:25,051 --> 01:13:27,119
Yes.

1280
01:13:28,988 --> 01:13:30,590
Oh, daddy.

1281
01:13:32,091 --> 01:13:33,825
Oh, my.

1282
01:13:33,826 --> 01:13:35,827
Somebody help me!

1283
01:13:35,828 --> 01:13:37,295
Somebody help me!

1284
01:13:37,296 --> 01:13:39,865
Somebody help me!

1285
01:13:39,866 --> 01:13:42,067
Help me!

1286
01:13:42,068 --> 01:13:43,636
Help me.

1287
01:13:53,079 --> 01:13:55,147
Oh, my god.

1288
01:14:04,791 --> 01:14:06,091
Look,
daddy, look.

1289
01:14:06,092 --> 01:14:07,693
What?

1290
01:14:07,694 --> 01:14:09,562
It's you.
It's you.

1291
01:14:11,831 --> 01:14:14,901
It says
Curtis burch,
but it's you.

1292
01:14:17,770 --> 01:14:21,139
It's that
cab driver's name.

1293
01:14:21,140 --> 01:14:24,676
I had no
identification.

1294
01:14:24,677 --> 01:14:26,913
He had my wallet.

1295
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:30,716
I'll get back
into my body

1296
01:14:30,717 --> 01:14:33,319
if you get back
in yours.

1297
01:14:40,259 --> 01:14:43,128
Go, daddy! Go, go!

1298
01:14:43,129 --> 01:14:44,997
Go! Please, go!

1299
01:15:20,867 --> 01:15:22,702
Daddy?

1300
01:15:30,977 --> 01:15:33,379
How do you feel?

1301
01:15:35,247 --> 01:15:38,884
There's a terrible
draft under my gown.

1302
01:15:38,885 --> 01:15:41,387
They took
my underwear off.

1303
01:15:44,023 --> 01:15:45,357
Oh, daddy.

1304
01:15:47,159 --> 01:15:49,261
I hurt everywhere.

1305
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:56,903
It's the most
wonderful feeling.

1306
01:16:01,674 --> 01:16:03,108
You should hurry.

1307
01:16:03,109 --> 01:16:04,310
Hurry.

1308
01:16:20,326 --> 01:16:21,960
I'm sorry.

1309
01:16:21,961 --> 01:16:23,161
I'm leaving.

1310
01:16:23,162 --> 01:16:25,030
I just...

1311
01:16:25,031 --> 01:16:26,364
I've tried,

1312
01:16:26,365 --> 01:16:29,367
but I can't sit
on a bedpan and go.

1313
01:16:29,368 --> 01:16:31,704
I've got to go
to the bathroom.

1314
01:16:32,872 --> 01:16:34,706
She's fibrillating.
Get the paddles

1315
01:16:34,707 --> 01:16:36,742
and get the epi.
Is respiratory here, yet?

1316
01:16:36,743 --> 01:16:38,109
Get on it, stat.

1317
01:16:38,110 --> 01:16:39,377
We're losing her.

1318
01:16:39,378 --> 01:16:41,047
Charging.

1319
01:16:49,388 --> 01:16:51,990
Wow. Super rad.

1320
01:16:51,991 --> 01:16:54,893
Wow, I'm o.K.
Give me a second.

1321
01:16:54,894 --> 01:16:57,462
What a rush.
I guess I'm cured, huh?

1322
01:16:57,463 --> 01:16:59,264
Thanks for your help,
everybody.

1323
01:16:59,265 --> 01:17:00,398
Oh.

1324
01:17:00,399 --> 01:17:01,432
Well, thanks.

1325
01:17:01,433 --> 01:17:02,769
Bye!

1326
01:17:09,041 --> 01:17:11,376
Come, let's go.
We found daddy's body.

1327
01:17:11,377 --> 01:17:12,878
He's right here.

1328
01:17:12,879 --> 01:17:14,245
He's not a ghost
anymore.

1329
01:17:14,246 --> 01:17:16,816
Let's go.

1330
01:17:50,282 --> 01:17:52,051
Jesus Christ!

1331
01:18:05,564 --> 01:18:07,499
Wait a minute.

1332
01:18:17,076 --> 01:18:18,309
Aah!

1333
01:18:18,310 --> 01:18:19,477
Aah!

1334
01:18:19,478 --> 01:18:21,212
Aah!

1335
01:18:21,213 --> 01:18:23,081
Aah!

1336
01:18:23,082 --> 01:18:24,282
Aah!

1337
01:18:24,283 --> 01:18:27,285
Evil master!

1338
01:18:27,286 --> 01:18:29,155
Your wallet.

1339
01:18:31,891 --> 01:18:34,960
I am yours to command!

1340
01:18:34,961 --> 01:18:36,561
Command?

1341
01:18:36,562 --> 01:18:38,396
Command?

1342
01:18:38,397 --> 01:18:40,832
I command you to...

1343
01:18:40,833 --> 01:18:43,568
Go to hell and sit
on a red-hot coal

1344
01:18:43,569 --> 01:18:45,837
and wait for me...

1345
01:18:45,838 --> 01:18:48,039

1346
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:51,376
