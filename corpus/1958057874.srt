1
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:51,904
Whoa!

2
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:55,074
Why you always gotta be swinging, huh?

3
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:57,368
You broke my belt loop.

4
00:01:58,828 --> 00:02:00,037
Gimme a light?

5
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:03,082
Get your own light.

6
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,087
- Food?
- Yeah.

7
00:02:14,844 --> 00:02:16,720
So, how many cars you steal?

8
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:18,347
Four. You?

9
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:21,058
Two. You'll learn.

10
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:25,688
-I set out for two and I got two.
-Well, why didn't you set out for four?

11
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:28,232
If I was in a mood for four,
I would have taken four.

12
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:33,320
I could triple you on your best night
and not even break a sweat.

13
00:02:33,404 --> 00:02:35,573
Mm?

14
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:36,782
Okay.

15
00:02:38,868 --> 00:02:41,745
-You a gambling woman?
-Lay it down.

16
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:44,123
Well, we each pull one more.

17
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:46,500
-First one back to your place wins.
-Wins what?

18
00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:49,962
Well, I win...

19
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:52,590
you perform a service of an oral nature

20
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:55,384
involving the scraping of knees
and a sore jaw.

21
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:59,263
-Betting for sex is desperate and cliché.
-And necessary.

22
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,518
Look, I'm not gonna lie to you,

23
00:03:04,602 --> 00:03:06,770
but on my list of things
I'd rather be doing,

24
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:10,900
training a rookie outside a grease pit
is about neck and neck with a colectomy.

25
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:14,695
-I'm not a rookie.
-Compared to me, you are.

26
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:17,615
Lesson one.
See that skinny weasel inside the diner,

27
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:19,658
chomping down on chicken tenders?

28
00:03:19,742 --> 00:03:22,161
-Yeah.
-He works for Mitch Murray's chop shop,

29
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:24,872
which we've been
trying to bust for two years.

30
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:26,290
Why haven't we?

31
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,584
He's good.

32
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:31,170
And the girl?

33
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:33,756
Better.

34
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:36,800
I'm loyal, respectable,
alarmingly attractive.

35
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:38,844
I should be peeling down your panties
on a nightly basis.

36
00:03:38,928 --> 00:03:43,223
But, no. It's, "Tony, unhand my thong.
Tony, get your face out of my ass."

37
00:03:43,933 --> 00:03:45,976
Just tell me how long I gotta wait.

38
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,645
Gimme a time frame,
so I don't get bitch-slapped

39
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,772
every time I...

40
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:51,774
take a crack at your zipper.

41
00:03:55,194 --> 00:03:56,528
You'll get me when you do it.

42
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:00,574
Do what?

43
00:04:00,658 --> 00:04:04,203
Well, there's something a guy has to do
before I get dirty with him.

44
00:04:05,955 --> 00:04:08,040
Or else I feel cheap and disgusting.

45
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,167
Oh.

46
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,586
So, every guy you've ever slept with
in your entire life

47
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,922
has completed this mystery task.

48
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:16,382
Every one.

49
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:19,218
Tell me.

50
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:22,304
If I tell you,
then you're gonna swear up and down

51
00:04:22,388 --> 00:04:24,431
that you were just about to do it.

52
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:26,767
You could have been planning it tonight,
for all I know.

53
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,937
But if I tell you, and then you do it,

54
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,981
then I won't believe
you would have done it originally,

55
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:33,774
and nobody gets nothing, so...

56
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:39,154
Tell me.

57
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:41,740
No.

58
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:46,036
Well, what letter does it start with?

59
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:52,042
You know, every cop from Maine to Miami
has tried to outdrag this chick.

60
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:54,128
She's like that stringy cartoon bird.

61
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:56,839
You could be right on top of her,
then boom, like a bat outta hell,

62
00:04:56,922 --> 00:05:00,926
she's gone and you're standing in the dust
chewing gravel.

63
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:02,803
It's poems, isn't it?

64
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:04,596
It's none of your goddamn business.

65
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,017
-That ass is my business.
-Are we gonna bet, or aren't we?

66
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:12,771
You're scared. You're scared of men.

67
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:16,150
Oh, Tony, is that you...
Is that you being deep?

68
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:17,484
Okay.

69
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:20,362
Johnnie Walker Blue.

70
00:05:20,446 --> 00:05:22,614
And don't roll up in Aunt Ethel's Nova.

71
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:24,575
Go for a classic. Pre-70.

72
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:27,703
Sixty-seven.

73
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:31,540
Don't hurt yourself.

74
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:40,674
Well, giddy up.

75
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:50,142
-Come on, honey. Get in the car.
-No!

76
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:51,435
Come on, please.

77
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:52,936
-I just wanna talk to you.
-No, Doug. Get lost.

78
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,938
-Come on, sweetie. Just get in the car.
-No!

79
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:56,523
Come on, please, baby.

80
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,817
-Come on, get in the friggin' car!
-Get lost, Doug.

81
00:05:58,901 --> 00:06:01,695
-I'm trying to talk to you.
-Get off! Get off of me!

82
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:05,074
Get off of me!

83
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:07,034
Don't make me smack you again.
Sit in the car.

84
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:09,411
Just get in the...

85
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,706
Excuse me.

86
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,208
Sweetheart, when I'm talking to you,
you'll know,

87
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,502
because I'll be looking somewhere
in the vicinity of your face.

88
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:18,212
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

89
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:19,755
Ohh! Ohh!

90
00:06:22,925 --> 00:06:25,969
-You owe me 50 bucks.
-You said Sunday.

91
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:27,638
I said Saturday.

92
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:32,434
-Who's your pal?
-Doug. He popped me.

93
00:06:32,518 --> 00:06:33,685
Ow!

94
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:36,522
-Oh, yeah?
-She stole my wallet!

95
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:39,149
Oh, yeah. After he popped me.

96
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:43,570
Brenna, when people lend you money,
you pay it back in a timely fashion, okay?

97
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:44,530
Ahh!

98
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:47,032
-Double or nothing.
-What's the bet?

99
00:06:47,116 --> 00:06:50,327
How many teeth come out when I smash
this punk's face against his beamer.

100
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,870
-What?
-Three.

101
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:53,038
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

102
00:06:53,122 --> 00:06:55,582
This bitch steals my wallet,
and you're busting my teeth?

103
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:56,917
-That's wrong.
-That's right.

104
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,502
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait.

105
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,504
Wait. Let's think this through, honey.

106
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:03,757
If there's no debt,
then you wouldn't need to bet.

107
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:06,885
-In theory.
-So if I gave her the 50,

108
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:08,262
then we'd all be cool, all right?

109
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:11,557
Oh, lookit there, Doug.
It's a possible solve.

110
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:15,769
But far be it for me to explain
a man's chivalrous nature.

111
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:18,897
No, no, no.
No, no, I'm cool, I'm cool...

112
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:20,482
Get out of here, punk.

113
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,026
Here's your wallet, Doug.

114
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:28,365
Thank you.

115
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:30,826
Oh, come on, Sage.

116
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:33,370
Enough with the idiot boyfriends,
all right?

117
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,331
Well, he seemed sweet.

118
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:42,671
6-4-Q-J-A-3.

119
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:47,009
Brenna again?

120
00:07:48,177 --> 00:07:50,554
You know, it gets me all weepy.

121
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,765
What?

122
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:55,517
The way you look after her.

123
00:07:56,018 --> 00:07:59,563
-It's a tender thing.
-Someone dusted your Froot Loops, man?

124
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:06,653
Is that him? You got Doug's address?

125
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:08,113
Kneecaps?

126
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:10,490
No, I'd just bust a limb.

127
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:13,512
Ow.

128
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:36,887
Jesus.

129
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:44,561
-What are you doing?
-Calling it in.

130
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,854
You want the whole department to know

131
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:47,773
that you're getting your ass whupped
by a girl in a Dodge?

132
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:58,158
-Left! Left!
-No! Right. She's not going left.

133
00:10:58,742 --> 00:10:59,910
-Okay, go right.
-Unh!

134
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:07,167
Easy, easy.

135
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,677
Oh, Jesus.

136
00:11:30,232 --> 00:11:31,691
Ha!

137
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:13,650
Whoo-ooh!

138
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:24,828
-Great.
-Out of the--

139
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:32,461
My Aunt Gertie could out-drive you
blindfolded on a dead goat.

140
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:34,796
Yeah? I'd like to meet your Aunt Gertie.

141
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,305
Oh, shit.

142
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,351
Shit! What's she doin'?

143
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:51,855
Jesus!

144
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:01,406
She's up top.

145
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:07,412
Jesus!

146
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:14,920
Yo! Open the flap.

147
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:16,630
- You hot?
- Open the flap.

148
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:19,799
-Sage, I can hear the sirens.
-It's an audio book.

149
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,719
I can't help you, Sage.

150
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:23,929
You know what?
That's fine, all right?

151
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:26,306
I'm coming through anyway,
so get out of my way.

152
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:29,559
Sage, I'm not opening these doors.

153
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:43,365
-She's here.
-Drive.

154
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:45,200
-She's right here.
-Would you drive?!

155
00:13:57,379 --> 00:13:59,256
Whoo-ee!

156
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,341
You never come back hot.
What's wrong with you?

157
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:06,680
But...that is a '66 Charger,

158
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:09,140
383, four-barrel.

159
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:13,395
Man, I pity the guy who lost this car.

160
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:14,938
How you know it's not a girl?

161
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:19,317
What kind of chick drives around
with plates that read "BADASS"?

162
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:21,361
One that knows how to pick a Dodge.

163
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:26,616
Hey, your kid ever finish
that model Chevelle?

164
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,578
Yeah. Got it built, painted...
named after you.

165
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:31,413
-Really?
-Yeah.

166
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:34,207
She says if you don't come to
her birthday party, she's not having one.

167
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:35,959
All right. I'll bring her a piñata.

168
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:39,921
Sage, you don't wanna go in there.
Sage. Sage--

169
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:44,009
Well, you're gonna go anyways,
so what does it matter?

170
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,811
Two Mazdas, one vintage Dodge.

171
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:56,896
Grand.

172
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:11,036
-Was that you that came back hot?
-Yup.

173
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:20,045
Look, I pull 30 cars a month, Mitch.

174
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:24,007
That's five times more
than any potbellied ape

175
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,635
dragging his sack around this place.

176
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:28,386
I came back hot. I'm sorry.

177
00:15:30,472 --> 00:15:31,723
I pulled it off.

178
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:36,227
Have you seen the car?
It's a collector. No damage.

179
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:39,564
Mitch, if you're gonna get your nipples
all in a knot,

180
00:15:39,648 --> 00:15:41,441
I'm gonna take my talent elsewhere.

181
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:51,660
He came back hot.

182
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:57,832
Hm.

183
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,295
Are you gonna come back hot?

184
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:16,726
Here's $500.

185
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:32,409
Sucks, dude.

186
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:39,416
Hey, in approximately 30 seconds,
Tony's gonna roll in here

187
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:43,586
with some pimp's nasty-ass pink Ford,
and I'm not gonna say a word.

188
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,713
Uh-uh.

189
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:48,508
I am just gonna point
at this exquisite chariot...

190
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:53,221
and just watch the tears
flow from his eyes.

191
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:55,557
-Tony took off.
-What? He's been here?

192
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,601
Yeah. He just dropped that Porsche off
about an hour ago.

193
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,565
You're kidding.

194
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:05,734
Sorry.

195
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,904
You don't have to sleep with him
or anything, do you?

196
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:13,158
God.

197
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,499
- Blue Label.
- Shot?

198
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,501
-Bottle.
-Bottle?

199
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:26,129
You, uh, lose a bet?

200
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:29,048
Never.

201
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,470
Hey, sport, you forgetting something?

202
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,601
I'm having a friend over
and I wanna impress him.

203
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,745
Hey, babe, you win.

204
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,333
Tony.

205
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:11,257
Tony.

206
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,610
Oh--

207
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,126
Yo! I'm taking the Charger.

208
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:49,254
- The hell you are.
- Tony's gonna die.

209
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:51,506
What, someone's gonna kill Tony
'cause of a Dodge?

210
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:54,509
-Hey, hey, hey. What the fuck?
-Not kidding.

211
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:56,803
Wait, wait, wait.

212
00:18:58,054 --> 00:18:59,639
Mitch leaves in an hour, okay?
I'll meet you around back.

213
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:03,309
-I can't do it.
-Sage, he'll kill you.

214
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:04,811
Wait. Wait.

215
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:08,398
It's for the padlock.

216
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:10,275
Step away from the Charger.

217
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:13,987
Mitch, listen. Whoever owns this car
has Tony, all right?

218
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:18,408
And if I don't get it back in 30 minutes,
Tony dies. Please.

219
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:22,287
I'll buy it back, all right?

220
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:25,081
-All right. 1,000.
-You only gave me 500.

221
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,083
-I'm asking 1,000.
-I don't have 1,000.

222
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,918
Well then, you don't have a Charger.

223
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:31,880
I'll pay you tomorrow.

224
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:34,090
-Get out of my way.
-Get out of the car, Sage.

225
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,551
-Get out of my way, dude.
-Get out of the car!

226
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:39,929
I'm not kidding with you, Sage.
Get out of the car!

227
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:42,390
You wanna leave? Fine. Be my guest.

228
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:44,017
You ain't going anywhere!

229
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:46,853
Gimme the gun.

230
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:49,647
Hey. Take it easy, dude. Hey, hey, hey.

231
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:51,232
If she doesn't go, Tony's gonna die.

232
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:08,124
Fuck!

233
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:12,045
Sage!

234
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:55,880
Whoa!

235
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,389
Unhh!

236
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:49,809
Unhh!

237
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:58,109
Unhh! Unhh! Unhh!

238
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:08,494
Get up!

239
00:22:33,478 --> 00:22:34,687
Unhh!

240
00:23:33,663 --> 00:23:35,039
Tony?

241
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:53,141
Oh, my God.

242
00:23:53,224 --> 00:23:54,350
Fuck.

243
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:22,837
Tony?

244
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:28,092
- Whoa.
- Hey.

245
00:24:28,176 --> 00:24:30,511
-Would you look at this place?
-What are you doing?

246
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:34,140
Yeah. It's friggin' Babylon.

247
00:24:35,433 --> 00:24:38,728
Just wanted to introduce my partner.
Oliver Fitzgerald.

248
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:42,064
You may recall kicking the almighty crap
out of him earlier this evening.

249
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:45,234
Fitzy, this here is Sage.

250
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,528
Hey, is that tequila?

251
00:24:49,322 --> 00:24:51,073
Look, I know what you're thinking.

252
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:53,618
Police harassment. Unlawful entry.

253
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:55,620
Blah, blah, blah.

254
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:59,916
But here's what.
Right now, we're not cops.

255
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:02,126
Okay? We're off duty.

256
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:04,837
We're just a couple of guys
dropping by for some drinks.

257
00:25:04,921 --> 00:25:06,380
Hmm?

258
00:25:06,464 --> 00:25:10,593
See, my partner here,
he just made detective, so I'm...

259
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:13,429
I'm showing him around,
introducing him to the local talent.

260
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,768
Listen, Sage, you gotta tell me something.

261
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:21,896
-Who taught you to drive like that...
-Hey! Yo, man...

262
00:25:22,605 --> 00:25:24,690
Can we do this another night?

263
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:28,152
What's the matter? You don't like us?

264
00:25:28,236 --> 00:25:29,695
No. It's not that.

265
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:32,198
I mean, I'm always looking
for an opportunity to do shots

266
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:35,284
with the local law enforcement,
but tonight's a bit...

267
00:25:35,368 --> 00:25:36,661
Rigorous?

268
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:39,288
You feel me.

269
00:25:43,501 --> 00:25:44,669
Where's your can?

270
00:25:59,934 --> 00:26:01,852
I'm gonna nail you on this one.

271
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:06,482
Yeah. We'll see about that, little rookie.

272
00:26:16,534 --> 00:26:19,578
So, how long you been boosting?

273
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:23,582
-I'm sorry. Boosting?
-Boosting cars. How long?

274
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:26,627
-No one says that.
-Yeah. What do they say?

275
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,964
If I tell you, will you leave?

276
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:32,883
-Maybe.
-Yeah? All right.

277
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:36,470
Zag.

278
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:39,515
-Zag?
-Yeah. Zag.

279
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:42,018
Get it? Like zip and zag.

280
00:26:42,852 --> 00:26:45,688
You know, like, "Hey, Lou,
you zag any Fiats tonight?"

281
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:50,401
"Yeah, Sage. I zagged four of 'em.
Right off 63rd and Main.

282
00:26:50,484 --> 00:26:53,487
"Can't talk now.
I'm off to go to zag a Buick."

283
00:26:55,865 --> 00:26:56,991
You screwing with me?

284
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:00,411
You're screwing with me.

285
00:27:07,585 --> 00:27:08,878
Hello!

286
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:12,840
Not for nothing, but your can
reeks like a dead goose.

287
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:20,306
-Get your hands up where I can see them.
-What's going on, Eddie?

288
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:22,641
-Get your hands up where I can see them.
-You guys, listen.

289
00:27:22,725 --> 00:27:23,934
-Relax! Listen...
-I don't care!

290
00:27:24,018 --> 00:27:26,103
-The Charger... I stole it!
-Stay where you are!

291
00:27:26,187 --> 00:27:28,397
-Get your hands away from your pockets.
-What's going on, Eddie?

292
00:27:28,481 --> 00:27:29,857
Get your hands--

293
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:37,990
Ohh!

294
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,058
Oh, my God.

295
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:21,260
What's going on?

296
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:27,641
Sage, what's going on?

297
00:29:33,314 --> 00:29:35,316
Someone did something tonight.

298
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:38,152
Something really, really horrible.

299
00:29:39,862 --> 00:29:41,697
And it looks like I did it.

300
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:44,617
And I didn't.

301
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:49,330
And I have to find this guy...

302
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:53,083
You know what? It's vital that
you don't tell anyone where I am,

303
00:29:53,167 --> 00:29:55,336
-do you understand?
-Mm-hm.

304
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:00,132
Well, what did he do?

305
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:03,844
I can't tell you.

306
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:05,804
I can't.

307
00:30:07,598 --> 00:30:09,600
Okay. Then come with me.

308
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:12,811
Come on. There's a hot DJ
at the Green Fiend tonight.

309
00:30:12,895 --> 00:30:15,814
-Please?
-Your lip's bleeding, Brenna.

310
00:30:17,942 --> 00:30:19,276
Shit.

311
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:29,036
Did you bang him?

312
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:32,122
Yeah.

313
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:37,336
Did he cook for you?

314
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:42,424
Did he cook for me?

315
00:30:43,384 --> 00:30:44,510
Food.

316
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:46,762
Well, yeah,
he bought me a bag of Ruffles once.

317
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,013
Doesn't count.

318
00:30:48,097 --> 00:30:49,848
Well, why the hell does
a guy have to cook for you?

319
00:30:49,932 --> 00:30:54,061
Why? Because guys see the world
like an enormous barnyard.

320
00:30:54,144 --> 00:30:57,106
-What?
-Pick any animal. Just anything.

321
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:01,610
-A duck.
-A duck? Okay.

322
00:31:01,694 --> 00:31:03,362
You can be a duck...

323
00:31:04,697 --> 00:31:09,493
floating on the pond,
feathers all fluffed and layered just so.

324
00:31:10,828 --> 00:31:12,913
But the minute that
you give it up for a guy,

325
00:31:12,997 --> 00:31:15,791
you're no longer a duck, you're a hog.

326
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:19,878
Wallowing and snorting
in your own revolting slop.

327
00:31:19,962 --> 00:31:24,800
But if a guy cooks for you first,
before you spread...

328
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:29,930
then you're immune to hog status
and you'll forever retain the elegance...

329
00:31:30,264 --> 00:31:32,224
of a duck.

330
00:31:32,308 --> 00:31:33,934
Get it?

331
00:31:34,018 --> 00:31:36,770
So, you never banged a guy
unless he cooked for you?

332
00:31:36,854 --> 00:31:38,230
Hell, no.

333
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,317
-Never.
-Really?

334
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,319
Nope.

335
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:17,645
Brenna.

336
00:32:20,022 --> 00:32:21,982
Make a fist.

337
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:27,613
Thumb out.

338
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:31,575
-Now, go.
-Go where?

339
00:32:31,659 --> 00:32:33,160
Hit me!

340
00:32:33,243 --> 00:32:35,120
- You're high.
- Hit me.

341
00:32:35,204 --> 00:32:37,206
You're high, Sage.

342
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:39,249
Brenna, have you ever thrown
a punch in your life?

343
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:41,919
Nope. And that's because
punching's mean.

344
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:47,841
Right now, there's a thousand girls
just like you,

345
00:32:47,925 --> 00:32:50,386
face down in the gutter,

346
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:53,347
covered in blood and spit

347
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:57,893
and a variety of even more disgusting
bodily fluids.

348
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,646
And the only difference
between you and that gutter

349
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:03,524
is the amount of ruthless
that you pack in your fist.

350
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:06,360
So get up and knock me out flat,
right now!

351
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:08,028
I'm going dancing, okay?

352
00:33:08,112 --> 00:33:10,072
I'm gonna kick your ass
if you don't kick my ass.

353
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:13,575
No! Okay? You can
knock my teeth out with a crowbar,

354
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:15,828
and I wouldn't lay a hand on you, Sage.

355
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:38,851
Are you okay, Sage?

356
00:33:43,981 --> 00:33:46,775
I was going to boil some noodles...if--

357
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:49,570
if you want some.

358
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:02,499
What?

359
00:34:06,754 --> 00:34:09,715
-It's cold.
-Your leather, really?

360
00:34:10,299 --> 00:34:15,053
Oh! You do love me. You love me!
You love me! Bye.

361
00:34:15,137 --> 00:34:19,016
Brenna, next time you get in trouble,
you're on your own.

362
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:20,684
Yeah, yeah. Bye.

363
00:34:50,798 --> 00:34:52,216
I'll see ya inside.

364
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:08,816
Oh, guys, please?

365
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:12,861
Thank you.

366
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:22,848
-Hi.
-Nice jacket.

367
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:25,142
-It's a friend's.
-Oh.

368
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:27,394
-Your name?
-Oh.

369
00:36:28,562 --> 00:36:30,480
Brenna.

370
00:36:30,564 --> 00:36:31,899
Larch.

371
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:38,030
-She, uh, she here?
-Who?

372
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:41,283
-Your friend.
-How did you know it was a "she"?

373
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:43,285
The way you said "friend".

374
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,330
She's not here.

375
00:36:48,415 --> 00:36:49,625
Huh.

376
00:36:56,673 --> 00:37:00,135
Used to live in Jersey City.
I know all about Sage.

377
00:37:01,637 --> 00:37:03,972
Her father owned a garage on 25th.

378
00:37:04,056 --> 00:37:08,268
After he died, it went down,
left her with nothing.

379
00:37:09,603 --> 00:37:13,482
Eventually,
after a couple of stints with juvie,

380
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:17,027
she started stealing--
anything from anybody.

381
00:37:19,071 --> 00:37:22,574
-They called her the Banshee.
-Why Banshee?

382
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:25,535
'Cause you're better off chasing a ghost,
I don't know.

383
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:27,829
Maybe she's just pissed off at the world.

384
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:32,626
-Okay, granted...
-Give me one of those.

385
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:35,545
She zags, but...

386
00:37:35,629 --> 00:37:37,422
she did not cut anybody up.

387
00:37:37,506 --> 00:37:40,634
That requires a special blend of depravity
this girl can't touch.

388
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:42,886
Jesus, Fitz, you're making a fool
out of yourself.

389
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:45,931
Therefore indirectly
making a fool out of me. Okay?

390
00:37:46,974 --> 00:37:49,017
It was the girl. Do you understand?

391
00:37:49,101 --> 00:37:52,604
Look, I know she's hot,
got that puppy dog thing going on

392
00:37:52,688 --> 00:37:54,439
when she's checking you out,

393
00:37:54,523 --> 00:37:57,609
but the point is she killed a man,
and we gotta find her.

394
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:01,238
So, none of this denial-
delusional trip, okay?

395
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:04,616
Checking me out how?

396
00:38:05,367 --> 00:38:07,703
W-Was she looking at my ass?

397
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:12,207
God knows how many cars she stole,

398
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,084
and she's just chopped up
some poor jerk-off,

399
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:15,210
threw you in front of a train,

400
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,796
all in one night, and you're asking me
if she was checking out your ass?

401
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:22,384
About three or four times.

402
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:25,721
What the hell is "zag"?

403
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:28,306
techno music playing]

404
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:31,393
-Why the Rat King?
-Why do you care?

405
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:33,437
It tells a deeper story.

406
00:38:37,441 --> 00:38:39,985
We are live on the Web.

407
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:48,243
How long you known her?

408
00:38:49,411 --> 00:38:51,079
I caught a bus out here
a couple of years ago,

409
00:38:51,163 --> 00:38:53,081
and she was the first thing I saw.

410
00:38:53,165 --> 00:38:55,375
She took to me, you know?
Like a big sister.

411
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:07,095
Are you going?

412
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:09,973
Yeah. Got some stuff I want to work on.

413
00:39:11,058 --> 00:39:12,726
You can watch if you're interested.

414
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,021
Okay.

415
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:47,302
Hey! Hey!

416
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:56,394
-Do you cook?
-What?

417
00:39:56,478 --> 00:39:58,021
You know, cook?

418
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,525
Sure.

419
00:40:03,235 --> 00:40:06,988
It's a shortcut to the hotel.
Beats walking in the cold.

420
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:39,479
Oh...

421
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:07,674
This is Dallas. Leave a message.

422
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:10,802
Dallas, it's Sage.

423
00:41:11,553 --> 00:41:14,848
I need you to run a plate, okay?

424
00:41:14,931 --> 00:41:16,391
Call you later.

425
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:40,582
Watch your step.

426
00:41:49,424 --> 00:41:51,509
Some shortcut.

427
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:03,188
Oh, wow.

428
00:42:14,241 --> 00:42:15,575
Oh.

429
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:20,914
You know, my mom used to say
I had musical talents.

430
00:42:24,251 --> 00:42:25,460
Come here.

431
00:42:30,173 --> 00:42:31,341
Ow!

432
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:32,634
I'm sorry.

433
00:42:33,385 --> 00:42:37,180
Ow! Ow!

434
00:42:38,265 --> 00:42:40,767
Some say
the eyes are the windows to the soul.

435
00:42:41,893 --> 00:42:43,645
Incas believe it's a voice,

436
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:46,481
but only in moments of purest honesty.

437
00:42:49,776 --> 00:42:51,278
Like when?

438
00:42:54,698 --> 00:42:56,741
When you lose control.

439
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:06,876
Would you mind
if I showed you a dog brain?

440
00:43:16,845 --> 00:43:21,308
Everything you've lived, good or bad,
it's hardwired in here.

441
00:43:21,391 --> 00:43:24,436
Imprinted, locked in place.

442
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:28,106
You deprive it of its senses
and it gets confused,

443
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:30,191
you know, cuts loose from reality.

444
00:43:31,401 --> 00:43:33,153
Some say it's the ultimate high.

445
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:36,239
Have a seat.

446
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:39,993
Introduce...

447
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:43,997
certain ELF frequencies...

448
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:50,587
and you can rewire the brain
to think it's seeing God

449
00:43:54,049 --> 00:43:56,634
Or...the devil.

450
00:43:59,387 --> 00:44:00,972
Your worst nightmare.

451
00:44:04,392 --> 00:44:06,436
And then there's the hypothalamus,

452
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:10,607
which controls sex and rage.

453
00:44:12,317 --> 00:44:17,280
ELF frequencies can turn that rage...
into love...

454
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:23,953
a hard-on...or a scream.

455
00:44:27,874 --> 00:44:32,087
-Where did you get a dog brain?
-Last bitch who sat in that chair.

456
00:45:22,095 --> 00:45:23,221
Dallas speaking.

457
00:45:23,304 --> 00:45:25,223
Dallas, I need a plate.

458
00:45:25,306 --> 00:45:27,016
I hear you're in deep with Mitch.

459
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:28,935
BADASS25.

460
00:45:29,018 --> 00:45:30,812
Yeah, yeah, keep your shorts on.

461
00:45:32,564 --> 00:45:34,607
You know the price on your ass?
I'm impressed.

462
00:45:34,691 --> 00:45:36,151
Are you checking the plate or not, man?

463
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:38,570
Hey, M.L. Totty, 505 Lytton.

464
00:45:38,653 --> 00:45:40,155
-Great.
What do you need this for--

465
00:45:50,331 --> 00:45:54,586
-Hi, I'm looking for an M.L. Totty.
-Found her.

466
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:57,922
-Oh, you own a '66 burgundy Charger.
-I sold it.

467
00:45:58,006 --> 00:45:59,466
To who?

468
00:45:59,549 --> 00:46:00,884
I'm coming!

469
00:46:00,967 --> 00:46:03,094
-My maintenance man.
-Is he here?

470
00:46:03,178 --> 00:46:06,639
No, he comes and goes as he pleases.
I don't keep track.

471
00:46:06,723 --> 00:46:09,559
He's got a setup up there in the attic
for when he works late.

472
00:46:09,642 --> 00:46:13,396
-Gotta go. I'm late for my prayer circle.
-Okay, well do you know where he is?

473
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:16,441
-Why?
-'Cause I want his car.

474
00:46:16,524 --> 00:46:18,776
Don't know. Don't want to.

475
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:22,530
Jesus ain't gonna give a rat's ass
if we're five minutes late!

476
00:46:22,614 --> 00:46:24,199
What is his name?

477
00:49:30,385 --> 00:49:33,471
Dallas, Sage. I need a number. It's a cop.

478
00:49:33,554 --> 00:49:35,431
No, I'm fine.

479
00:49:35,515 --> 00:49:37,141
Oliver Fitzgerald.

480
00:49:41,187 --> 00:49:42,647
Okay, go.

481
00:49:43,523 --> 00:49:44,816
Uh-huh.

482
00:49:46,317 --> 00:49:47,402
All right, thanks.

483
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:49,654
-Yeah.
-It's Sage.

484
00:49:49,737 --> 00:49:51,698
Listen, I stole that car,

485
00:49:51,781 --> 00:49:56,452
and there was a note, and it said that
if I didn't bring it back, Tony dies.

486
00:49:56,536 --> 00:49:58,579
So I traced the plate...

487
00:49:58,663 --> 00:49:59,831
Hold on a second.

488
00:49:59,914 --> 00:50:02,500
I'm walking around here
with my balls on fire,

489
00:50:02,583 --> 00:50:04,252
wondering if I'll ever breed,

490
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:07,755
and you call me up,
babbling about running a plate?

491
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:10,216
Are you a sociopath or just bipolar?

492
00:50:10,299 --> 00:50:12,719
-I'm not crazy.
-You threw me in front

493
00:50:12,802 --> 00:50:15,513
-of a train?
-I know, but I took it back.

494
00:50:15,596 --> 00:50:17,724
I mean, would a psycho
pass up an opportunity

495
00:50:17,807 --> 00:50:21,144
to watch a cop get smashed
by a speeding train? No.

496
00:50:21,227 --> 00:50:23,020
Well, listen.
If what you're saying is true,

497
00:50:23,104 --> 00:50:24,772
why don't you come down to the station,

498
00:50:24,856 --> 00:50:28,901
fill out a report, and I'll do what I can
to make sure you get a fair trial, okay?

499
00:50:28,985 --> 00:50:30,319
505 Lytton St.

500
00:50:30,403 --> 00:50:32,697
The guy that cut up Tony
used to live there,

501
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,323
and he goes back there occasionally.

502
00:50:34,407 --> 00:50:35,575
How do you know?

503
00:50:35,658 --> 00:50:37,618
I just told you, I traced the plates,

504
00:50:37,702 --> 00:50:40,496
okay? It's BADASS25.

505
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:43,624
Our best chance at nailing this guy
is through his car,

506
00:50:43,708 --> 00:50:47,336
because he loves the Charger,
and the Charger's wrecked.

507
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:51,132
I found some garage receipts,
but with no shop names,

508
00:50:51,215 --> 00:50:52,633
but they were all the same,

509
00:50:52,717 --> 00:50:57,096
meaning there is a 99% chance
that the car is either there

510
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:59,056
-or it's gonna be there.
Why don't you just

511
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:02,477
come down to the station
and we'll work this out step by step?

512
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,521
No, 'll take the garages
from Washington to Park.

513
00:51:05,605 --> 00:51:08,858
You take the ones from South to Fuller,
you got that?

514
00:51:08,941 --> 00:51:11,235
-Yeah.
And, look...

515
00:51:11,319 --> 00:51:13,154
sorry about your balls.

516
00:51:16,949 --> 00:51:18,117
Yeah.

517
00:51:24,207 --> 00:51:26,959
Get me the juvie file on Sage Rion.

518
00:51:32,924 --> 00:51:35,760
Hey, you seen a '66 Charger?

519
00:51:35,843 --> 00:51:37,845
I hear you're in a world of shit.

520
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:42,099
'66 Charger. Burgundy.
Have you seen it?

521
00:51:43,935 --> 00:51:46,312
-That's Pete's.
-Who's Pete?

522
00:51:46,395 --> 00:51:49,440
He's a guy from the neighborhood.
Hits a lot of car shows.

523
00:51:49,524 --> 00:51:53,486
-Okay, well, does Pete have a last name?
-I don't know. Pete's Pete.

524
00:51:54,612 --> 00:51:58,032
-Well, where can I find Pete?
-He's up on Nimitz.

525
00:51:58,115 --> 00:52:01,369
-Where?
-It's one of those weird alley entrances.

526
00:52:02,370 --> 00:52:05,248
-I'd have to show you.
-So show me.

527
00:52:06,624 --> 00:52:10,503
Yeah, sure. I just gotta call my boss
in case he comes by.

528
00:52:10,586 --> 00:52:12,255
-Help yourself.
-Thanks.

529
00:52:13,673 --> 00:52:15,341
You gonna get fired, you think?

530
00:52:15,967 --> 00:52:18,010
No. Watch this.

531
00:52:18,553 --> 00:52:20,513
Hey, it's Stick.

532
00:52:20,596 --> 00:52:23,808
Listen, my buddy popped by...

533
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:27,103
and I gotta take her to see
her sick, decrepit grandma

534
00:52:27,186 --> 00:52:29,564
who just got mashed by a Charger.

535
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:31,607
Right. Uh-huh.

536
00:52:33,818 --> 00:52:35,069
Cool.

537
00:52:35,987 --> 00:52:37,321
Damn, I'm good.

538
00:52:37,405 --> 00:52:38,781
So, let's go.

539
00:52:43,327 --> 00:52:45,955
Hi, how are you?
My name's Oliver Fitzgerald.

540
00:52:46,038 --> 00:52:47,790
I was here to ask you a few questions.

541
00:52:47,874 --> 00:52:50,418
Oh, yeah. Come in. Here.

542
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:53,462
Thank you.

543
00:53:26,162 --> 00:53:30,124
I haven't been up there in years.
My back is so bad.

544
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:33,210
If I went up those stairs,
I'd never get back down.

545
00:53:33,294 --> 00:53:37,048
-So, tell me about Larch.
-Best maintenance man I ever had.

546
00:53:37,131 --> 00:53:41,302
Never see him. He fetched up
on my doorstep several years ago,

547
00:53:41,385 --> 00:53:42,720
looking for work.

548
00:53:42,803 --> 00:53:45,681
I'm figuring on
turning this into a B&B.

549
00:53:45,765 --> 00:53:48,851
There's money there.
Plumbing, rewiring...

550
00:53:48,935 --> 00:53:50,478
man can do anything.

551
00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:54,106
-And he lives in the attic?
-Oh, only when he works late.

552
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:55,358
I never see him these days.

553
00:53:55,441 --> 00:53:57,652
I think he might have found himself
a lady friend or something.

554
00:53:59,946 --> 00:54:04,951
I came back from a retreat, and he'd been
looking after the place while I was gone,

555
00:54:05,034 --> 00:54:07,578
and I found some panties in the hallway.

556
00:54:08,871 --> 00:54:10,331
Well, they certainly weren't mine.

557
00:54:13,125 --> 00:54:15,670
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

558
00:54:20,549 --> 00:54:23,594
- So, how do you know this guy?
- I don't know.

559
00:54:23,678 --> 00:54:27,181
-Well, where'd you meet him?
-Car show.

560
00:54:27,848 --> 00:54:30,101
-Car Classics?
-Yeah.

561
00:54:30,184 --> 00:54:33,396
-Yeah? Six months ago?
-Yeah.

562
00:54:33,479 --> 00:54:35,564
That show was canceled, man.

563
00:54:38,651 --> 00:54:41,946
My kids go to bed hungry. Understand?

564
00:54:44,865 --> 00:54:48,369
- It's not their fault.
- Hold the fuck up!

565
00:54:52,957 --> 00:54:54,083
Come on.

566
00:54:56,252 --> 00:54:57,336
You're a bitch.

567
00:55:06,762 --> 00:55:09,056
Hey, I got proof that it's not her.

568
00:55:10,558 --> 00:55:12,601
John Larch. 505 Lytton.

569
00:55:12,685 --> 00:55:14,478
He records his victims.

570
00:55:26,365 --> 00:55:27,616
It's on there.

571
00:55:28,617 --> 00:55:30,202
Hm.

572
00:55:30,286 --> 00:55:32,204
Hm.

573
00:55:32,288 --> 00:55:34,415
Those death throes are scaring
the hell out of me.

574
00:55:34,498 --> 00:55:36,834
I won't be able to sleep for a week.

575
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:42,173
Look. Pressure, sound level,
pitch frequency.

576
00:55:42,256 --> 00:55:46,260
This guy has literally made a science
out of psychological torture.

577
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:50,014
Look. Day one, day two, day three.

578
00:55:50,097 --> 00:55:51,682
Some girl named Denica.

579
00:55:51,766 --> 00:55:53,392
Around that time,
Denica Hodge disappeared.

580
00:55:53,476 --> 00:55:55,227
She lived, like, two blocks from there.

581
00:55:56,687 --> 00:55:58,689
Sage Rion stole this guy's car,

582
00:55:58,773 --> 00:56:00,483
and he retaliated
by killing her boyfriend,

583
00:56:00,566 --> 00:56:02,234
and I'm sure she's next.

584
00:56:04,779 --> 00:56:06,614
-How did you get this guy?
-Ran the plate.

585
00:56:06,697 --> 00:56:08,949
-You ran the plate.
-Yeah, that's what I said.

586
00:56:09,033 --> 00:56:11,118
You ran the plate, you found an address,

587
00:56:11,202 --> 00:56:13,704
you walked in and helped yourself
to his personal possessions

588
00:56:13,788 --> 00:56:15,414
without a warrant.

589
00:56:15,498 --> 00:56:18,334
-Oh, by chance, he wasn't home.
-It's him.

590
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:21,879
Fitz, I don't know if you're aware,

591
00:56:21,962 --> 00:56:25,424
but I've worked some of the largest
and most complicated homicide cases

592
00:56:25,508 --> 00:56:27,885
-in the history of this department.
-I heard.

593
00:56:27,968 --> 00:56:30,971
Yet I'm out there
doing the chop-shop circuit

594
00:56:31,055 --> 00:56:34,016
with every other ape
who just got his shield.

595
00:56:35,017 --> 00:56:40,314
The most dangerous thing a cop can do
is confuse instinct with wishful thinking.

596
00:56:41,107 --> 00:56:43,859
Why don't you just go there
and check it out?!

597
00:56:45,486 --> 00:56:48,114
Check what? Huh?

598
00:56:51,742 --> 00:56:53,702
Get some rest.

599
00:57:01,961 --> 00:57:03,963
I need a file, missing persons.

600
00:57:05,131 --> 00:57:06,465
Hodge, Denica.

601
00:57:06,549 --> 00:57:10,010
Oh, and while you're at it,
get me a propeller head.

602
00:57:10,094 --> 00:57:12,012
I need some help with something.

603
00:57:26,944 --> 00:57:29,280
Yo, why we gotta sit here
waiting for Kevin?

604
00:57:29,363 --> 00:57:31,198
-Can you kill a woman?
-You know that's not my style.

605
00:57:31,282 --> 00:57:32,700
Well, that's why
we gotta wait for Kevin.

606
00:57:33,993 --> 00:57:35,911
Why don't we just close our eyes
or something?

607
00:57:35,995 --> 00:57:37,580
All right, that's just stupid.

608
00:57:37,663 --> 00:57:40,624
Yeah, I'm looking for a '66 Charger.

609
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,628
You sure?

610
00:57:44,712 --> 00:57:46,380
-All right, thanks.
-Take it to Eddie for me.

611
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:48,674
-What's this?
-Sage Rion's juvie file.

612
00:58:00,561 --> 00:58:03,105
-That's Sage's screwdriver.
-Ex-screwdriver.

613
00:58:05,524 --> 00:58:06,942
Put it back.

614
00:58:07,026 --> 00:58:09,695
When did a corpse ever have use
for a screwdriver?

615
00:58:12,573 --> 00:58:15,284
-Corpse?
-Oh, you didn't hear?

616
00:58:15,367 --> 00:58:16,785
Oh.

617
00:58:39,266 --> 00:58:42,061
What if one of these cars
accidentally mashes her?

618
00:58:42,144 --> 00:58:43,938
I mean, technically it's an accident.

619
00:58:45,314 --> 00:58:47,191
Guilt-free, painless.

620
00:58:47,566 --> 00:58:48,901
Listen, in this business,

621
00:58:48,984 --> 00:58:51,570
I have to maintain
a certain level of respect.

622
00:58:51,654 --> 00:58:53,364
Therefore, when someone steals from me,

623
00:58:53,447 --> 00:58:56,408
I retaliate with
the most agonizing death possible.

624
00:58:56,492 --> 00:58:59,703
-So that's why we have to wait for Kevin?
-Now you're catching on.

625
00:59:13,092 --> 00:59:15,094
Look, you still gotta get rid
of these bodies, huh?

626
00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:19,473
We're driving a Fiat.

627
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:22,184
How am I supposed to fit two dead bodies
in the trunk of a Fiat?

628
00:59:22,268 --> 00:59:24,353
-I don't know, Guido. Be creative.
-What do you want me to do,

629
00:59:24,436 --> 00:59:27,273
melt 'em down with some acid
or something? What do you think?

630
00:59:30,776 --> 00:59:33,529
See, I pay you so I don't have
to think about details.

631
00:59:33,612 --> 00:59:35,864
Now, you can rent a van,
you can stir 'em up with pickled relish

632
00:59:35,948 --> 00:59:39,410
and serve them at a potluck.
The point is, you think.

633
00:59:43,497 --> 00:59:46,875
The next person who tries to make me think
gets a face full of slug.

634
00:59:46,959 --> 00:59:48,919
Any questions?

635
00:59:49,545 --> 00:59:50,838
All right now, get the door.

636
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:03,350
Come on, Mitch. Turn your back on me?
Little bitch!

637
01:00:03,434 --> 01:00:04,518
Come on!

638
01:00:11,859 --> 01:00:13,986
All right. Give me a gun.

639
01:00:18,198 --> 01:00:19,742
Look at what you're making me do!

640
01:00:22,328 --> 01:00:25,664
Let's do this, huh? Let's do this.

641
01:00:59,406 --> 01:01:01,283
Bring a bull.

642
01:01:01,367 --> 01:01:03,327
-Huh?
-The piñata.

643
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:06,372
My daughter wants a bull.

644
01:01:08,707 --> 01:01:10,417
I'll bring two.

645
01:02:07,850 --> 01:02:10,394
-Jesus.
-I'm screwed!

646
01:02:10,477 --> 01:02:14,440
And it's your goddamn fault!
So you better catch him!

647
01:02:14,523 --> 01:02:16,733
-What happened?
-None of your business.

648
01:02:17,526 --> 01:02:18,819
You gotta see a doctor.

649
01:02:18,902 --> 01:02:21,113
-Do you have tequila?
-Yeah.

650
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:39,506
-Did you check the garages?
-Yeah.

651
01:02:40,007 --> 01:02:42,342
Everything from 83rd to Park. You?

652
01:02:42,426 --> 01:02:44,011
I missed a few.

653
01:02:44,094 --> 01:02:46,805
You still need to check out Lenny's,
Ace's and Fred's.

654
01:02:46,889 --> 01:02:49,766
-Well, let's call.
-They're closed, idiot. It's Sunday.

655
01:02:52,019 --> 01:02:53,312
You just start at Lenny's

656
01:02:53,395 --> 01:02:55,898
and work your way over to Ace's,
and you need to look in the window,

657
01:02:55,981 --> 01:02:59,568
and if you see Larch's car,
you'll find him and you lock him up.

658
01:03:00,444 --> 01:03:03,280
And when you do, my ass is out.
I'm done.

659
01:03:05,115 --> 01:03:06,325
Done how?

660
01:03:07,159 --> 01:03:08,535
Done zagging?

661
01:03:09,453 --> 01:03:11,121
Zagging, yeah.

662
01:03:11,205 --> 01:03:13,457
That's a...word, right?

663
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:18,795
I don't even know why I'm here.

664
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:24,259
Yeah. Yeah.

665
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:26,887
There's something on it?

666
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:29,640
No, I don't have time to come down.
Just turn it up, let me hear it.

667
01:03:30,641 --> 01:03:34,394
Help me.

668
01:03:42,986 --> 01:03:45,489
So, you grow up with cars?

669
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:06,677
Hey, leave a message.

670
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:08,720
Fitz. Eddie. Call.

671
01:04:09,721 --> 01:04:14,393
John Friedling, alias Larch.
No priors, no known address.

672
01:04:14,476 --> 01:04:17,062
Committed to Birch Valley Asylum
ten years ago.

673
01:04:17,145 --> 01:04:18,814
Been out just under three years.

674
01:04:23,527 --> 01:04:24,861
What happened?

675
01:04:28,031 --> 01:04:29,157
Your arm.

676
01:04:31,368 --> 01:04:32,494
Wrecked.

677
01:04:33,370 --> 01:04:34,913
Why do you do it?

678
01:04:35,789 --> 01:04:38,250
-Do what?
-Steal.

679
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:41,420
'Cause I'm good at it.

680
01:04:43,672 --> 01:04:44,923
You know what I think?

681
01:04:46,425 --> 01:04:48,176
I think...

682
01:04:50,053 --> 01:04:51,513
ohh...

683
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:55,976
you do it
'cause it makes you feel powerful.

684
01:04:56,935 --> 01:04:57,936
Hmm.

685
01:04:59,146 --> 01:05:01,148
So, how come when a guy steals,
he's slick,

686
01:05:01,231 --> 01:05:02,482
but when a woman does,

687
01:05:02,566 --> 01:05:06,111
she's compensating
for some profound emotional lack?

688
01:05:06,194 --> 01:05:10,240
Because guys have testosterone,
makes you do some crazy, high-speed crap.

689
01:05:10,324 --> 01:05:11,491
[humorless chuckle

690
01:05:11,575 --> 01:05:14,369
I steal for the same reason
a hooker gives hand jobs.

691
01:05:14,453 --> 01:05:16,496
Starts with an "M,'' ends with a "Y,''

692
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:18,957
and there's an "O-N-E" in the middle.

693
01:05:19,625 --> 01:05:21,627
You know what that spells?

694
01:05:21,710 --> 01:05:23,712
You lost me at "hand job."

695
01:05:27,341 --> 01:05:28,842
Tell me about this.

696
01:05:36,099 --> 01:05:37,851
He lived right here.

697
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:39,603
-Here in this place?
-Yeah.

698
01:05:39,686 --> 01:05:44,274
With his whacked-out Aunt Twyla.
I don't know what happened to the parents.

699
01:05:44,358 --> 01:05:48,320
His arms and legs were always covered
in burns and infected scabs.

700
01:05:48,403 --> 01:05:51,281
Anyway, every day after school,
instead of coming inside,

701
01:05:51,365 --> 01:05:53,533
he'd go out back
and sit in his dad's Charger.

702
01:05:53,617 --> 01:05:56,703
-Hm.What did he do?
-Nothing.

703
01:05:56,787 --> 01:05:59,873
He just sat at the wheel
until late at night.

704
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:02,751
Protective Services finally stepped in.

705
01:06:02,834 --> 01:06:06,421
Rumor was Aunt Twyla locked him in a box
every time he pissed her off.

706
01:06:06,505 --> 01:06:08,298
Why did they lock him up?

707
01:06:08,382 --> 01:06:11,968
Because one day he shoved Aunt Twyla
down the garbage disposal.

708
01:06:14,388 --> 01:06:16,306
Who's got the rookie's home number?

709
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:22,354
If you don't tell me,
I'm gonna make something up.

710
01:06:28,485 --> 01:06:30,153
I saw your file.

711
01:06:32,072 --> 01:06:34,157
My dad was crazy, too, you know?

712
01:06:34,241 --> 01:06:37,744
All the best people have at least
one psychotic parental figure.

713
01:06:40,288 --> 01:06:41,498
Uh-huh.

714
01:06:41,873 --> 01:06:42,999
Yeah.

715
01:06:44,668 --> 01:06:46,002
I'm an idiot.

716
01:06:47,045 --> 01:06:48,797
You probably got that, though.

717
01:06:54,177 --> 01:06:56,304
Me and my sister
were eating mac and cheese.

718
01:06:56,388 --> 01:06:58,724
My mom was dead, so I always cooked.

719
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:03,770
And my dad came in
and he knocked us both out.

720
01:07:06,189 --> 01:07:09,735
When I woke up,
we were in the garage...

721
01:07:09,818 --> 01:07:12,487
in the backseat of the car
with the motor running.

722
01:07:14,072 --> 01:07:16,908
My dad had run one of those tubes in,
you know?

723
01:07:21,371 --> 01:07:23,874
Me and my sis were both tied up.

724
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:29,963
Reminded me of this picture I saw once
of this rat king.

725
01:07:30,046 --> 01:07:35,469
The rats were forced so close together
that they became a single snarl.

726
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:41,433
I don't even know if my sister was dead.

727
01:07:43,727 --> 01:07:45,479
It looked like it, though.

728
01:07:46,938 --> 01:07:48,648
She was pure white.

729
01:07:50,192 --> 01:07:51,610
So I just started freaking out.

730
01:07:51,693 --> 01:07:55,906
I just started kicking
and punching at the window

731
01:07:55,989 --> 01:07:59,659
and...next thing I know,
I was on the lawn

732
01:07:59,743 --> 01:08:03,205
and the paramedics were pulling
all this glass out of my arm, so...

733
01:08:04,164 --> 01:08:05,999
Did they get her out?

734
01:08:12,547 --> 01:08:15,133
I can't even remember
if I tried to save her.

735
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:22,891
Sometimes when I'm sleeping,
I see myself pulling at the rope.

736
01:08:24,643 --> 01:08:29,022
I don't know if it's something
that I'm just remembering

737
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:31,107
or something I made up.

738
01:08:32,275 --> 01:08:33,276
You know?

739
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:35,028
Yeah.

740
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:37,697
-You gonna get that?
-Yeah.

741
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:43,203
Yeah.

742
01:08:44,162 --> 01:08:45,163
When?

743
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:47,707
I'll be there.

744
01:08:47,791 --> 01:08:51,419
You're off. They finally listened
to those CDs I found.

745
01:08:51,503 --> 01:08:54,881
They're at Larch's old place now.
I'm gonna go check those garages,

746
01:08:54,965 --> 01:08:57,425
see if I can locate
a current address on Larch.

747
01:08:57,509 --> 01:09:01,805
I'll be back, uh, like, two hours.
You gonna be here?

748
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:04,599
All right, yeah.
Well, you'll either be here,

749
01:09:04,683 --> 01:09:05,767
or you won't be here.

750
01:09:05,851 --> 01:09:07,310
If you're here, I'll see you,

751
01:09:07,394 --> 01:09:11,273
and if you're not, you're not.
So...there.

752
01:09:14,776 --> 01:09:16,194
Hey.

753
01:09:22,868 --> 01:09:24,369
I'll clean up.

754
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:42,345
Wake up, woman.

755
01:09:43,805 --> 01:09:46,683
Brenna, wake up.

756
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:49,561
I'm coming to get my jacket.

757
01:10:04,326 --> 01:10:07,120
Let me out! Please!

758
01:10:22,594 --> 01:10:23,720
Please!

759
01:10:29,935 --> 01:10:31,227
We're live.

760
01:10:46,076 --> 01:10:48,036
Hey, thanks for coming.

761
01:10:53,458 --> 01:10:56,503
Listen, I gotta leave town for a while.

762
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:59,172
Yeah, I heard.

763
01:10:59,798 --> 01:11:02,217
Got some...got some fucked-up shit.

764
01:11:03,927 --> 01:11:07,263
You know, I got some people
I could hook you up with. Good people.

765
01:11:09,099 --> 01:11:12,477
No, I'll be fine. I'll be fine.

766
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:16,022
Um, I'm gonna wire some money.
Can you make sure Brenna gets it?

767
01:11:16,106 --> 01:11:17,107
Yeah.

768
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:20,735
'Cause she's too much of a dunce
to deal with wired money.

769
01:11:20,819 --> 01:11:23,655
Sage, that girl's the only thing you
care anything about in this world,

770
01:11:23,738 --> 01:11:28,159
yet every time you open your mouth,
it's "dummy" or "dunce" or "dingbat."

771
01:11:28,243 --> 01:11:29,953
You realize this?

772
01:11:31,204 --> 01:11:33,581
You know why people hate the world, Sage?

773
01:11:33,665 --> 01:11:35,208
Hm?

774
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:36,710
Because they want to.

775
01:11:37,836 --> 01:11:40,171
That's beautiful, Dallas.

776
01:11:40,255 --> 01:11:41,631
I'm serious.

777
01:11:42,924 --> 01:11:46,469
I've been watching you
and I know you're a good kid.

778
01:11:51,433 --> 01:11:53,893
Can I borrow your car for a couple hours?

779
01:11:55,937 --> 01:11:57,313
Absolutely not.

780
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:27,761
Hey.

781
01:12:29,596 --> 01:12:32,223
I'm leaving town for a while.

782
01:12:32,307 --> 01:12:33,933
You don't have to come,

783
01:12:34,017 --> 01:12:37,854
'cause I got no time for shady,
jacket-heisting babes.

784
01:12:39,981 --> 01:12:41,775
I'm gonna leave you this number,
all right?

785
01:12:42,776 --> 01:12:44,652
And I'll call you if I can.

786
01:12:45,403 --> 01:12:47,322
I'm not seeing my jacket, Brenna.

787
01:13:27,612 --> 01:13:31,199
Fitz, it's Sage. Please call me.

788
01:14:08,570 --> 01:14:10,822
-Hey, can I get a tequila?
-Sure.

789
01:14:11,573 --> 01:14:14,117
Have you seen a girl with curly hair
and a rat jacket?

790
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:15,869
Not since last night.

791
01:14:15,952 --> 01:14:18,079
-Who was she with?
-DJ.

792
01:14:23,751 --> 01:14:25,295
Thank you.

793
01:15:46,793 --> 01:15:47,877
Hey!

794
01:15:58,263 --> 01:15:59,430
Hey!

795
01:16:06,437 --> 01:16:07,563
Hey!

796
01:16:08,189 --> 01:16:09,816
Lenny told me
to deliver this car.

797
01:16:09,899 --> 01:16:11,985
Where?
You got his address?

798
01:16:14,904 --> 01:16:16,864
Help me!

799
01:16:22,745 --> 01:16:24,122
Please!

800
01:16:31,004 --> 01:16:32,630
Sage, please.

801
01:16:34,299 --> 01:16:36,259
Save me, Sage.

802
01:17:41,616 --> 01:17:42,992
Yeah. Hey,

803
01:17:43,076 --> 01:17:44,952
his real name is Friedling.
We're running a search right now.

804
01:17:45,036 --> 01:17:46,496
- Yeah, yeah, got him.
- Say again?

805
01:17:46,579 --> 01:17:48,790
El Circe on William,
I'm heading there now.

806
01:17:49,957 --> 01:17:52,335
Touch nothing. You hear me?

807
01:17:53,127 --> 01:17:54,295
Hello?

808
01:19:02,321 --> 01:19:03,489
Brenna.

809
01:20:04,759 --> 01:20:06,135
Where is she?!

810
01:20:07,094 --> 01:20:10,640
Where is she?!

811
01:20:19,148 --> 01:20:21,359
Let me out!

812
01:20:24,612 --> 01:20:26,697
Sage, please.

813
01:20:30,785 --> 01:20:33,079
-Help me. Help me.
-Brenna.

814
01:21:00,731 --> 01:21:01,857
Ohh!

815
01:21:11,659 --> 01:21:14,829
Brenna.

816
01:21:51,657 --> 01:21:54,285
-Sage, please.
-Brenna.

817
01:21:54,368 --> 01:21:56,579
Brenna.

818
01:21:57,955 --> 01:22:00,708
-Sage.
-Brenna.

819
01:22:00,791 --> 01:22:02,668
Brenna.

820
01:22:04,378 --> 01:22:06,881
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

821
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:10,259
Hold on, Brenna, I'm here.

822
01:22:10,343 --> 01:22:11,927
Hold on, Brenna, I'm here.

823
01:22:14,305 --> 01:22:16,599
- I'm here.
- I'm here.

824
01:22:20,728 --> 01:22:22,229
-This thing's locked.
-This thing's locked.

825
01:22:22,313 --> 01:22:24,440
-Hold on, Brenna.
-Hold on, Brenna.

826
01:22:29,779 --> 01:22:32,073
-Hold on, baby.
-Hold on, baby.

827
01:22:32,156 --> 01:22:34,283
No! Come on!

828
01:22:35,159 --> 01:22:36,202
Unhh!

829
01:22:39,538 --> 01:22:41,791
Oh, my God.

830
01:22:41,874 --> 01:22:43,459
Oh, my God.

831
01:22:45,002 --> 01:22:46,837
It's me. It's me.

832
01:22:46,921 --> 01:22:48,923
It's safe. Come on. Come on.

833
01:22:49,006 --> 01:22:51,967
-I don't know where he is.
-Don't know where he is.

834
01:22:53,010 --> 01:22:54,095
Come on.

835
01:22:59,475 --> 01:23:02,019
Oh, my God. Come on,
we're gonna get out of here.

836
01:23:02,103 --> 01:23:04,563
Please, Brenna.
Please be strong for me, please.

837
01:23:04,647 --> 01:23:07,233
Come on. Come on.

838
01:23:07,316 --> 01:23:11,028
Oh, no. No, honey. Please, Brenna.

839
01:23:18,744 --> 01:23:21,205
I'm looking for a guy
named John Friedling.

840
01:23:21,288 --> 01:23:22,456
Goes by Larch?

841
01:23:22,540 --> 01:23:24,834
-Don't know him.
-You don't know your tenants?

842
01:23:24,917 --> 01:23:29,004
Look, I'm just the night guy, all right?
I know nobody.

843
01:23:29,088 --> 01:23:31,048
-How many people live here?
-A dozen.

844
01:23:31,132 --> 01:23:33,092
A dozen on what, eight floors?

845
01:23:34,051 --> 01:23:36,178
We only use the bottom three.

846
01:23:41,308 --> 01:23:43,978
John Larch or John Friedling staying here?

847
01:23:44,770 --> 01:23:46,731
-I already asked.
-Don't know him.

848
01:23:46,814 --> 01:23:49,108
-Well, let me see a list of your tenants.
-I don't have one.

849
01:23:49,191 --> 01:23:50,901
Well, what the hell is that?

850
01:23:51,652 --> 01:23:54,989
All right, is there anybody
who strikes you as being a little odd?

851
01:23:55,072 --> 01:23:57,408
-I. Don't. Know.
-Guess.

852
01:23:57,491 --> 01:23:59,410
Suck my nuts, all right?

853
01:23:59,493 --> 01:24:01,287
Unhh! All right, all right. Look, look.

854
01:24:01,370 --> 01:24:05,291
There's this guy, he's a little on
the weird side. He keeps odd hours.

855
01:24:05,374 --> 01:24:07,460
-I don't know how he lives with the smell.
-What room?

856
01:24:07,543 --> 01:24:10,504
-What smell?
-Bad eggs, you know? Graveyard-y.

857
01:24:10,588 --> 01:24:13,632
So, you smell decaying flesh,
but you don't call anybody.

858
01:24:13,716 --> 01:24:16,010
-What room!
-320.

859
01:24:17,219 --> 01:24:19,096
-I thought it was eggs.
-You said "graveyard-y."

860
01:24:19,180 --> 01:24:21,098
Hey, there's an easier way to do this!
Follow him!

861
01:24:21,182 --> 01:24:22,767
Give me the key, now!

862
01:24:22,850 --> 01:24:25,019
Let's go.

863
01:24:30,357 --> 01:24:31,776
Sit down.

864
01:24:45,790 --> 01:24:48,083
Brenna...

865
01:24:48,167 --> 01:24:50,252
I'm gonna tie this hose around you,

866
01:24:50,336 --> 01:24:53,923
then I'm gonna let you down the elevator,
and you have to trust me, okay?

867
01:24:56,801 --> 01:24:59,887
Hands where I can see 'em, drop the pills,
get up slowly.

868
01:25:02,890 --> 01:25:05,184
Come here. Come here, help me.
Move your arm.

869
01:25:06,185 --> 01:25:07,812
Here you go. I've got you.

870
01:25:07,895 --> 01:25:09,730
Let's go. I've got you. All right, go.

871
01:25:13,526 --> 01:25:14,819
You're almost there, Brenna.

872
01:25:16,654 --> 01:25:17,655
Oof.

873
01:25:17,738 --> 01:25:19,824
Looks like
you've been busy here, huh?

874
01:25:19,907 --> 01:25:22,368
- Oh, Jesus.
- Hank?

875
01:25:22,451 --> 01:25:25,538
- What the hell am I looking at?
- It's a meth lab.

876
01:25:25,621 --> 01:25:28,082
I've got you. You're almost there.

877
01:25:35,923 --> 01:25:38,050
-What's upstairs?
-I don't know, I've never been.

878
01:25:38,759 --> 01:25:39,969
You're almost there.

879
01:25:46,100 --> 01:25:48,143
- Sage!
- Come on.

880
01:25:48,227 --> 01:25:50,813
I'd kill you...
but then you'd miss the show.

881
01:25:56,402 --> 01:25:57,903
Brenna!

882
01:26:01,907 --> 01:26:04,535
- I'm still up here.
- Stay put, I'll be right there.

883
01:26:04,618 --> 01:26:06,203
It's okay, it's okay.
You'll be all right.

884
01:26:50,289 --> 01:26:52,166
Sage, please.

885
01:27:21,320 --> 01:27:22,780
We're live.

886
01:27:29,620 --> 01:27:31,914
Welcome to my show.

887
01:28:17,543 --> 01:28:19,378
Aaah!

888
01:28:34,977 --> 01:28:36,437
Piece of shit!

889
01:28:38,188 --> 01:28:39,023
Aaah!

890
01:28:40,524 --> 01:28:42,234
-Fuckin' die.
-No!

891
01:28:42,317 --> 01:28:43,318
- No!
- No!

892
01:28:43,402 --> 01:28:46,655
-No! Let me fucking go!
-Easy.

893
01:28:48,615 --> 01:28:49,700
Unhh!

894
01:29:12,431 --> 01:29:14,475
No!

895
01:29:38,373 --> 01:29:40,501
- Oh, my God.
- Stand down.

896
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:02,856
Show's over.

897
01:30:22,459 --> 01:30:26,964
We're talking about eight bodies so far.
I know it's impressive.

898
01:30:27,047 --> 01:30:28,257
S-Sort of.

899
01:30:29,091 --> 01:30:32,886
Hey, I'm sorry about your jacket.

900
01:30:34,096 --> 01:30:36,974
You crazy?
Yeah, you owe me one.

901
01:30:39,351 --> 01:30:41,228
I'm gonna come later, okay?

902
01:30:56,076 --> 01:30:58,370
They're gonna have
to take her in for observation.

903
01:31:06,086 --> 01:31:07,296
Hey.

904
01:31:11,758 --> 01:31:13,010
How is she?

905
01:31:15,804 --> 01:31:17,264
She's tough.

906
01:31:21,393 --> 01:31:24,229
Am I done here?

907
01:31:24,938 --> 01:31:26,690
It shouldn't be too much longer.

908
01:31:28,942 --> 01:31:30,277
You hungry?

909
01:31:32,112 --> 01:31:35,616
Why don't you come over?
I'll make you some tortellini.

910
01:31:39,328 --> 01:31:41,288
What?

911
01:31:42,956 --> 01:31:44,333
Nothing.

912
01:32:09,816 --> 01:32:11,443
So, how about I drive?
