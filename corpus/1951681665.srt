1
00:00:37,516 --> 00:00:39,780
They're not as bad as you might think.

2
00:00:40,118 --> 00:00:42,245
In fact, sometimes
they're pretty good company.

3
00:00:42,554 --> 00:00:43,714
Cuff up!

4
00:00:43,822 --> 00:00:48,623
You can get used to just about anything
in prison. Even a Palmetto bug.

5
00:00:50,228 --> 00:00:51,627
I tried writing again.

6
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:55,029
Nothing came out
that didn't sound bitter and cynical.

7
00:00:56,001 --> 00:01:00,062
There's nothing worse than a writer
who doesn't have anything to say.

8
00:01:08,213 --> 00:01:09,475
That's me.

9
00:01:10,082 --> 00:01:11,572
Harry Barber.

10
00:01:55,027 --> 00:01:56,460
Hey, Harry.

11
00:01:56,862 --> 00:02:00,525
I've got some good news.
I mean some real good news.

12
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:04,124
You know what this is?
This is your ticket out of here.

13
00:02:04,336 --> 00:02:06,270
- Here's the judge.
- Right here, Barber.

14
00:02:10,575 --> 00:02:14,477
Mr. Barber, your conviction has been
overturned by a federal judge.

15
00:02:14,713 --> 00:02:16,271
Flipped like a buttermilk pancake.

16
00:02:16,348 --> 00:02:20,375
Testimony in a related case contradicted
key evidence presented at your trial.

17
00:02:20,752 --> 00:02:24,051
What he's saying is
someone's turned states and 'fessed up.

18
00:02:24,389 --> 00:02:25,720
You were framed.

19
00:02:26,058 --> 00:02:29,118
Your sentence has been commuted,
effective immediately.

20
00:02:29,594 --> 00:02:31,425
Don't thank me. Not much, anyway.

21
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:35,523
The paperwork has been filed.
You'll be released within 24 hours.

22
00:02:35,634 --> 00:02:37,067
All right!

23
00:02:37,235 --> 00:02:38,566
All right.

24
00:02:39,604 --> 00:02:41,902
What's wrong? You're free.

25
00:02:44,976 --> 00:02:46,568
Your Honor...

26
00:02:47,846 --> 00:02:49,746
I don't want to be ungrateful.

27
00:02:50,782 --> 00:02:53,080
That's it, I'm done. I'm free.

28
00:02:53,752 --> 00:02:57,119
This is justice.
What about the two years of my life?

29
00:02:57,489 --> 00:03:00,720
Two years of my life wasted
because I was honest.

30
00:03:00,826 --> 00:03:03,727
Because I wasn't dirty like everybody else.
What about that?

31
00:03:03,795 --> 00:03:06,491
You can take that up with your attorney.

32
00:03:06,798 --> 00:03:09,323
No, I'm taking it up with you!

33
00:03:09,468 --> 00:03:11,299
You're the justice system!

34
00:03:11,536 --> 00:03:13,936
What about my... Don't turn me off!

35
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:17,270
Don't turn me off! You bastard!

36
00:03:17,576 --> 00:03:19,441
I want my two years back!

37
00:03:19,611 --> 00:03:21,442
I want it back!

38
00:03:22,247 --> 00:03:25,045
I want it back! I want my two years!

39
00:03:33,492 --> 00:03:36,859
Oh, my goodness, Harry Barber,
as I live and breathe.

40
00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:40,298
John Renick.
Aren't you a little out of your jurisdiction?

41
00:03:40,766 --> 00:03:42,757
- Maybe.
- Got a cig?

42
00:03:44,503 --> 00:03:45,970
Let me give you a lift.

43
00:03:46,037 --> 00:03:48,972
- It'll be 105 today.
- I can take a little heat.

44
00:03:49,407 --> 00:03:51,432
Come on. Hop in.

45
00:03:53,445 --> 00:03:55,379
I'm heading right back to Palmetto.

46
00:03:56,481 --> 00:03:57,709
I ain't going to Palmetto.

47
00:03:57,783 --> 00:03:59,876
Is that right? Where are you going?

48
00:04:00,452 --> 00:04:01,578
Miami.

49
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:08,749
It's all over with, Harry.

50
00:04:09,661 --> 00:04:11,925
Palmetto's cleaned up top to bottom.
Trust me.

51
00:04:12,898 --> 00:04:15,594
Yeah, I'll just bet it squeaks.

52
00:04:17,836 --> 00:04:19,269
Thanks for the cig.

53
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:30,179
Wait. You're really going to Miami?

54
00:04:30,549 --> 00:04:34,679
Miami, Atlanta, Houston, San Francisco.
As long as it ain't Palmetto.

55
00:04:35,053 --> 00:04:37,021
- What's Nina say about that?
- I didn't ask.

56
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:38,520
Maybe you should.

57
00:05:04,015 --> 00:05:06,142
You smell good, Harry.

58
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,712
Nina, I am not going back to Palmetto.

59
00:05:14,159 --> 00:05:16,218
Oh, you taste good.

60
00:05:17,128 --> 00:05:19,323
Nina, it's been a couple of years.

61
00:05:19,598 --> 00:05:20,929
I know.

62
00:05:23,134 --> 00:05:25,329
I'm going to Miami.

63
00:05:25,704 --> 00:05:27,399
Shut up, Harry.

64
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,743
- 'Morning.
- 'Morning.

65
00:05:37,682 --> 00:05:39,115
Is it morning?

66
00:05:39,384 --> 00:05:41,477
I don't know. I think so.

67
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,549
Thanks for making the coffee.

68
00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:45,688
Pretty good, huh?

69
00:05:47,492 --> 00:05:48,550
Strong?

70
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,224
Weak?

71
00:05:51,529 --> 00:05:52,791
Bad.

72
00:05:54,266 --> 00:05:57,429
It's been a couple years.
I was looking at your...

73
00:05:57,836 --> 00:05:59,303
...piece there.

74
00:05:59,704 --> 00:06:01,001
The marquet?

75
00:06:01,106 --> 00:06:04,303
Marquet. I don't understand
how you make any money.

76
00:06:04,409 --> 00:06:06,104
If you sell it for 12 bucks...

77
00:06:06,278 --> 00:06:09,270
...the metal itself
has gotta be worth more than that.

78
00:06:09,514 --> 00:06:11,106
Well, actually...

79
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:14,482
...it's $1,200, Harry.

80
00:06:17,422 --> 00:06:18,821
It's $1,200.

81
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:22,221
This is what I do now.

82
00:06:22,394 --> 00:06:24,294
Yeah, I don't blame you.

83
00:06:39,144 --> 00:06:40,611
Find anything?

84
00:06:40,779 --> 00:06:41,803
Sure.

85
00:06:45,383 --> 00:06:47,146
There's nothing I'm good at.

86
00:06:47,485 --> 00:06:50,147
It'll be tough for you in this town,
Mr. Barber.

87
00:06:50,255 --> 00:06:51,483
Think so?

88
00:06:54,359 --> 00:06:56,486
- Don't you like my bourbon?
- I do.

89
00:06:56,661 --> 00:06:57,787
Why don't you take it?

90
00:06:58,463 --> 00:06:59,987
I don't drink.

91
00:07:01,633 --> 00:07:04,466
Maybe tomorrow I'll ask
why you ordered it if you don't drink.

92
00:07:06,237 --> 00:07:07,829
Maybe tomorrow I'll tell you.

93
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:19,883
How'd it go today?

94
00:07:20,485 --> 00:07:21,884
Humiliating.

95
00:07:23,188 --> 00:07:26,646
Listen, baby, you can't expect
something good just to happen overnight.

96
00:07:27,325 --> 00:07:29,350
I've got my exhibition coming up.

97
00:07:29,661 --> 00:07:32,459
If you want to,
I have so much work to do...

98
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:37,263
I don't know how I'll ever finish. I have
deliveries, I have to figure out the space...

99
00:07:37,335 --> 00:07:39,599
We can maybe do it together.
It might be fun.

100
00:07:40,038 --> 00:07:42,973
- I could make some deliveries for you?
- That'd be great.

101
00:07:43,108 --> 00:07:45,372
I'd be your fucking errand boy.

102
00:07:45,777 --> 00:07:48,439
I didn't mean it that way.
I just thought that...

103
00:07:48,546 --> 00:07:49,774
Don't think!

104
00:07:49,881 --> 00:07:53,248
You worry about your scrap metal,
I'll worry about Harry Barber.

105
00:08:16,941 --> 00:08:18,738
I need to make a phone call.

106
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:20,241
Right over there.

107
00:08:20,645 --> 00:08:21,805
Thank you.

108
00:09:55,707 --> 00:09:57,231
Oh, God!

109
00:10:08,353 --> 00:10:10,821
I left my handbag in there.

110
00:10:15,293 --> 00:10:18,854
I was just gonna hand it in
to the bartender.

111
00:10:20,265 --> 00:10:21,323
How thoughtful of you.

112
00:10:21,432 --> 00:10:22,694
Is there a problem, lady?

113
00:10:23,101 --> 00:10:26,127
No, I left my handbag in the phone booth...

114
00:10:26,204 --> 00:10:28,866
...and this gentleman was going
to turn it in.

115
00:10:29,274 --> 00:10:30,866
Make sure everything's there.

116
00:10:38,383 --> 00:10:40,351
Yes, it's all here.

117
00:10:40,952 --> 00:10:42,146
Thank you.

118
00:10:44,822 --> 00:10:46,084
And thank you.

119
00:10:50,261 --> 00:10:51,819
Can I buy you a drink?

120
00:10:52,764 --> 00:10:55,699
- It's not necessary.
- But it's customary.

121
00:11:00,605 --> 00:11:01,629
Excuse me.

122
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,337
Another round for the gentleman.

123
00:11:04,409 --> 00:11:06,570
I'll have a vodka martini with a twist.

124
00:11:28,266 --> 00:11:29,426
You...

125
00:11:30,501 --> 00:11:31,525
...Iost?

126
00:11:34,606 --> 00:11:36,335
Do I seem lost?

127
00:11:36,407 --> 00:11:38,272
No, just a little...

128
00:11:39,244 --> 00:11:40,677
...out of place.

129
00:11:41,179 --> 00:11:43,238
I'll take that as a compliment.

130
00:11:45,316 --> 00:11:48,774
Take it any way you like it.
My name's Harry Barber.

131
00:11:53,691 --> 00:11:55,249
So, Mr. Barber...

132
00:11:56,794 --> 00:11:58,284
How do you spend your time?

133
00:11:58,563 --> 00:11:59,996
What do you mean?

134
00:12:00,198 --> 00:12:02,098
I mean, what do you do?

135
00:12:03,835 --> 00:12:05,097
I don't smoke.

136
00:12:12,176 --> 00:12:15,304
Well, what do I do?
What does anybody do? I just...

137
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,943
...try to survive, I guess.

138
00:12:19,417 --> 00:12:22,113
Maybe you'd like to do
more than just survive?

139
00:12:24,055 --> 00:12:25,454
Who wouldn't?

140
00:12:28,926 --> 00:12:30,791
I may know of something.

141
00:12:33,665 --> 00:12:35,633
Would you be interested?

142
00:12:43,241 --> 00:12:44,799
I'm interested now.

143
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:47,134
The money's good.

144
00:12:48,346 --> 00:12:49,677
It's very good.

145
00:12:50,948 --> 00:12:53,178
But, in exchange, there's an element of...

146
00:12:55,853 --> 00:12:56,945
...risk.

147
00:12:57,221 --> 00:12:58,347
Risk?

148
00:13:01,693 --> 00:13:03,354
Does that worry you?

149
00:13:06,164 --> 00:13:08,029
Question is, does it worry you?

150
00:13:09,634 --> 00:13:12,125
If I could, I would do the job myself.

151
00:13:13,805 --> 00:13:15,932
What is this job exactly?

152
00:13:36,327 --> 00:13:38,818
Call me tomorrow
and we'll talk some more.

153
00:13:40,098 --> 00:13:41,963
I'm gonna settle the check.

154
00:13:43,968 --> 00:13:45,663
I almost forgot.

155
00:13:50,007 --> 00:13:51,065
I didn't.

156
00:14:02,487 --> 00:14:04,079
Until tomorrow then?

157
00:14:44,662 --> 00:14:46,562
I noticed your sign there.

158
00:14:46,664 --> 00:14:48,291
It said help was wanted.

159
00:14:48,466 --> 00:14:50,127
What kind of...

160
00:14:50,568 --> 00:14:52,297
...help do you need?

161
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:55,931
The $6 an hour kind:
to pump gas, cut bait...

162
00:14:56,207 --> 00:14:58,869
Wow, look at that boat. "Rhea M."

163
00:15:00,211 --> 00:15:01,473
Who owns that?

164
00:15:01,579 --> 00:15:03,308
Fella by the name of Malroux.

165
00:15:03,381 --> 00:15:04,973
Got an "x" on the end of it.

166
00:15:05,082 --> 00:15:08,540
- "X" on the end of what?
- His name. It's French or some such.

167
00:15:08,853 --> 00:15:10,252
Oh, yeah, French.

168
00:15:10,321 --> 00:15:11,982
His Christian name is Felix.

169
00:15:12,156 --> 00:15:14,750
That's got an "x" on the end of it, too,
by the way.

170
00:15:15,493 --> 00:15:18,929
I bet you were
a spelling bee champion in school.

171
00:15:19,163 --> 00:15:22,428
He owns that boat and he owns
that big house out on Cranleigh Key.

172
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,167
He bought that place?

173
00:15:24,435 --> 00:15:28,769
What's a fella with all that money doing
in a one-horse town like Palmetto?

174
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:29,998
Sorry.

175
00:15:30,341 --> 00:15:32,366
He's a lung cancer case.

176
00:15:32,643 --> 00:15:33,940
He's here for his health.

177
00:15:34,011 --> 00:15:36,741
He ain't got that much longer left to live,
I hear.

178
00:15:36,848 --> 00:15:39,408
- And the blonde?
- Mrs. Malroux.

179
00:15:39,717 --> 00:15:43,118
Boat's named after her.
Got another boat named Odette.

180
00:15:43,221 --> 00:15:44,882
That's named after his daughter.

181
00:15:44,956 --> 00:15:46,821
- Two "t's"?
- Yeah.

182
00:15:46,991 --> 00:15:49,221
But he don't keep her here.
The boat, I mean.

183
00:15:49,293 --> 00:15:50,590
Malroux.

184
00:15:53,598 --> 00:15:55,065
Must be worth a fortune.

185
00:15:55,733 --> 00:15:59,169
I wouldn't trade places with him
for all the tea in Chinee.

186
00:15:59,604 --> 00:16:01,037
He's a lung cancer case.

187
00:16:04,108 --> 00:16:06,668
You still interested in this job?

188
00:16:08,513 --> 00:16:10,310
No thanks, old-timer.

189
00:16:10,648 --> 00:16:12,513
I think I might have a better offer.

190
00:16:21,359 --> 00:16:22,519
Hi, baby.

191
00:16:22,627 --> 00:16:24,356
I'll see you in about an hour.

192
00:16:25,196 --> 00:16:27,528
- Where are you going?
- I've got a delivery to make.

193
00:16:28,533 --> 00:16:31,764
- Let me do it for you.
- No, after yesterday, no way.

194
00:16:32,336 --> 00:16:34,463
Let that go, first of all.

195
00:16:34,739 --> 00:16:36,900
It'll make me feel like I'm contributing.

196
00:16:37,308 --> 00:16:39,242
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

197
00:16:39,944 --> 00:16:40,876
Here.

198
00:17:28,693 --> 00:17:30,058
Can I help you?

199
00:17:30,861 --> 00:17:34,490
- Special delivery for Mrs. Malrow.
- I'll take it.

200
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:38,565
She has to sign for this herself.
It's a telephone order.

201
00:17:40,605 --> 00:17:42,095
Okay, wait right here.

202
00:18:07,932 --> 00:18:10,457
Hope I'm not disturbing you, Mrs. Malrow.

203
00:18:10,568 --> 00:18:14,402
It's Malroux.
No, you're not disturbing me at all.

204
00:18:15,139 --> 00:18:16,800
I was just gathering some rosemary.

205
00:18:16,874 --> 00:18:18,102
Hey, you!

206
00:18:19,076 --> 00:18:20,839
It's okay, Donnelly, I'll handle it.

207
00:18:20,911 --> 00:18:24,142
The next time you have a delivery,
can you wait outside?

208
00:18:24,515 --> 00:18:25,675
Yes, sir.

209
00:18:39,063 --> 00:18:41,258
I like your initiative, Mr. Barber.

210
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:43,800
Just checking my facts.

211
00:18:43,901 --> 00:18:45,493
And what are your facts?

212
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,532
That you're Rhea Malroux.

213
00:18:47,605 --> 00:18:49,835
You're married to Felix Malroux.

214
00:18:49,907 --> 00:18:52,137
You have a daughter named Odette...

215
00:18:53,177 --> 00:18:56,374
...and that you live in the biggest house
in Cranleigh Key.

216
00:18:58,082 --> 00:18:59,447
Anything else?

217
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,177
You have a job for me.

218
00:19:01,886 --> 00:19:04,480
Your facts seem to check out, Mr. Barber.

219
00:19:04,789 --> 00:19:05,983
So, let's talk.

220
00:19:09,593 --> 00:19:10,787
Not here.

221
00:19:12,863 --> 00:19:15,161
- Do you know East Beach?
- I know it.

222
00:19:15,866 --> 00:19:17,834
The bungalows for rent by the water?

223
00:19:18,002 --> 00:19:19,867
- I've seem them.
- Rent one.

224
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:22,300
Then what?

225
00:19:22,973 --> 00:19:24,463
Meet me tonight.

226
00:19:25,676 --> 00:19:27,667
Give me one good reason why I should.

227
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,211
I can do better than that.

228
00:19:33,984 --> 00:19:35,952
You have a phone call, ma'am.

229
00:19:36,987 --> 00:19:39,888
Let me pay you for that then.
Hundred, was it?

230
00:19:41,425 --> 00:19:42,585
Two.

231
00:19:43,928 --> 00:19:46,556
Give the man his money
and show him the way out.

232
00:19:54,338 --> 00:19:55,771
Can I use the car?

233
00:19:57,508 --> 00:19:59,066
Can I use the car?

234
00:20:03,013 --> 00:20:04,503
Oh, sorry.

235
00:20:05,249 --> 00:20:06,477
Can I use the car?

236
00:20:06,584 --> 00:20:10,520
Yeah. Sure. Wow.
You sure you got a job at the marina?

237
00:20:11,489 --> 00:20:14,583
- What do you mean?
- Well, you look pretty swanky-do.

238
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,522
Yeah, well, I'm excited to be working again.

239
00:20:18,796 --> 00:20:20,195
What, should I change?

240
00:20:20,364 --> 00:20:23,663
No, you look really handsome.
Go ahead, impress the fish.

241
00:20:24,802 --> 00:20:26,463
Come here. Give me a kiss.

242
00:20:34,145 --> 00:20:35,703
See you later. Have fun.

243
00:20:36,013 --> 00:20:37,947
Don't do that to the fish.

244
00:21:06,477 --> 00:21:08,570
Good evening, Mr. Barber.

245
00:21:24,328 --> 00:21:25,590
Excuse me.

246
00:21:31,869 --> 00:21:33,530
May I have a drink, please?

247
00:21:34,939 --> 00:21:36,998
Vodka martini with a twist?

248
00:21:37,441 --> 00:21:39,272
Bravo, Mr. Barber.

249
00:21:40,077 --> 00:21:42,045
You were paying attention in class.

250
00:21:54,925 --> 00:21:57,325
Are you married, Mr. Barber?

251
00:21:57,728 --> 00:21:58,786
No.

252
00:22:00,064 --> 00:22:01,793
Do you have a girlfriend?

253
00:22:03,067 --> 00:22:04,227
Yeah.

254
00:22:08,038 --> 00:22:09,835
We're living together.

255
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,805
How old-fashioned of you.

256
00:22:12,109 --> 00:22:15,510
I didn't know we were here
to discuss my personal life.

257
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:19,271
What's wrong with talking
about your personal life?

258
00:22:19,984 --> 00:22:21,884
- It's personal.
- Pardon me.

259
00:22:24,555 --> 00:22:25,647
So...

260
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:30,083
You wanted to talk with me
about something, Mrs. Malroux-row?

261
00:22:38,302 --> 00:22:39,894
I have a job for you.

262
00:22:40,671 --> 00:22:42,639
Yeah, you, so you said.

263
00:22:43,274 --> 00:22:46,175
As I mentioned,
there's an element of risk involved.

264
00:22:46,677 --> 00:22:49,407
- You mentioned that, yes.
- You do take risks...

265
00:22:49,647 --> 00:22:51,171
...don't you, Mr. Barber?

266
00:22:53,317 --> 00:22:54,045
Do I?

267
00:22:54,118 --> 00:22:57,554
You took a rather large risk
when you took the money from my purse.

268
00:22:58,155 --> 00:23:01,022
Sorry, we're all out of twist.

269
00:23:08,666 --> 00:23:12,659
So, what is this job anyway, Mrs. Malroux?

270
00:23:15,439 --> 00:23:18,067
My stepdaughter is going to be kidnapped.

271
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:21,870
The ransom will be $500,000.

272
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:24,980
I need someone to be
the threatening voice on the telephone.

273
00:23:25,082 --> 00:23:28,574
For that and collecting the ransom,
I'm willing to pay ten percent.

274
00:23:29,453 --> 00:23:31,978
That's $50,000.

275
00:23:37,294 --> 00:23:39,057
Yeah, I can do the math.

276
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:43,766
Are you interested?

277
00:23:45,135 --> 00:23:46,602
I'm no kidnapper.

278
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:50,536
I don't need you to kidnap anyone
because nobody's going to be kidnapped.

279
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:54,575
My stepdaughter, Odette, is...

280
00:23:54,845 --> 00:23:57,473
...simply going to disappear for a few days.

281
00:23:58,082 --> 00:23:59,743
Does she know that?

282
00:24:00,484 --> 00:24:02,247
It was her idea.

283
00:24:06,256 --> 00:24:08,986
What do you need $500,000 for?

284
00:24:09,827 --> 00:24:12,990
Your husband's rich.
Why don't you just ask him for the money?

285
00:24:14,865 --> 00:24:17,527
My husband believes
that his daughter and I...

286
00:24:17,601 --> 00:24:20,263
...should be able to manage
on the allowance he provides.

287
00:24:20,371 --> 00:24:22,669
I admit it's a generous allowance for...

288
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,667
...reasonable people.

289
00:24:25,309 --> 00:24:29,143
Just so happens that neither my
stepdaughter nor I are reasonable people.

290
00:24:32,016 --> 00:24:33,950
May I have another drink, please?

291
00:24:34,852 --> 00:24:38,948
You realize, of course,
that kidnapping is a federal crime...

292
00:24:39,256 --> 00:24:42,123
...and that the FBI is
probably gonna get in on this?

293
00:24:42,593 --> 00:24:46,290
First of all,
there's not going to be any kidnapping.

294
00:24:46,663 --> 00:24:49,496
Secondly, my husband will not
involve the authorities.

295
00:24:51,168 --> 00:24:53,398
So what makes you so sure about that?

296
00:24:53,537 --> 00:24:55,630
I know my husband.

297
00:25:00,878 --> 00:25:02,539
So, let me get this straight:

298
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,177
Girl disappears.

299
00:25:04,314 --> 00:25:06,680
I make a phone call, collect the money.

300
00:25:06,784 --> 00:25:09,810
I take my cut, I give you the rest,
the girl goes back home...

301
00:25:09,887 --> 00:25:12,822
...and everybody's happy ever after.
Is that the deal?

302
00:25:14,658 --> 00:25:15,955
Essentially.

303
00:25:16,293 --> 00:25:17,726
That sounds easy.

304
00:25:18,529 --> 00:25:20,053
It will be.

305
00:25:23,167 --> 00:25:24,566
Are you a cop?

306
00:25:25,235 --> 00:25:26,896
Do I look like a cop?

307
00:25:27,171 --> 00:25:28,866
Answer the fucking question.

308
00:25:30,174 --> 00:25:31,163
No.

309
00:25:32,042 --> 00:25:34,272
- You wearing a wire?
- A what?

310
00:25:55,099 --> 00:25:57,260
Did you find what you were looking for?

311
00:26:11,315 --> 00:26:13,374
Maybe you better check again.

312
00:26:13,884 --> 00:26:16,045
I don't want you to miss anything.

313
00:26:55,993 --> 00:26:57,654
In all this excitement...

314
00:26:57,895 --> 00:27:01,194
...Mr. Barber, I don't remember hearing
whether you were in...

315
00:27:01,465 --> 00:27:02,591
...or out.

316
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,533
In all this excitement,
I don't remember saying.

317
00:27:08,105 --> 00:27:09,663
I need to know.

318
00:27:10,741 --> 00:27:13,005
Time is of the essence.

319
00:27:17,447 --> 00:27:19,278
I need to meet with this Odette.

320
00:27:19,583 --> 00:27:21,448
That could be arranged.

321
00:27:25,022 --> 00:27:26,785
Tomorrow, here.

322
00:27:27,324 --> 00:27:28,382
Alone.

323
00:27:29,393 --> 00:27:31,293
She's only 17.

324
00:27:31,628 --> 00:27:33,357
You might need a chaperon.

325
00:27:37,267 --> 00:27:39,929
You don't have to worry about me.
I can behave myself.

326
00:27:40,037 --> 00:27:42,028
It's not you I'm worried about.

327
00:28:07,297 --> 00:28:08,730
How was it?

328
00:28:09,666 --> 00:28:13,261
Well, you know, dull, tedious, boring,
in no particular order.

329
00:28:15,505 --> 00:28:18,736
I got the strangest call
from Mrs. Wintergarden.

330
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:20,634
Who?

331
00:28:20,978 --> 00:28:22,878
Mrs. Wintergarden, the woman...

332
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:27,076
...whose house you took the vase over to
when you made the delivery yesterday.

333
00:28:30,287 --> 00:28:32,346
She says she never got it.

334
00:28:33,323 --> 00:28:35,257
You sure you had the right address?

335
00:28:37,194 --> 00:28:39,424
Sure, there was no one home.

336
00:28:39,529 --> 00:28:43,363
I just, you know, rang the doorbell,
put it on the steps.

337
00:28:44,735 --> 00:28:46,032
It's weird.

338
00:28:46,136 --> 00:28:48,195
It had such a beautiful finish.

339
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,598
I'll call her tomorrow.

340
00:28:51,942 --> 00:28:53,967
You come here. I've missed you.

341
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,373
I gotta take a shower.

342
00:28:58,782 --> 00:29:00,272
I smell like fish.

343
00:29:00,617 --> 00:29:02,016
Be right back.

344
00:29:05,622 --> 00:29:06,782
Hurry up.

345
00:29:25,142 --> 00:29:27,474
- Wild Bill.
- Hi, Mr. Barber.

346
00:29:28,345 --> 00:29:32,145
You think I could rent the bungalow
a couple extra days?

347
00:29:32,416 --> 00:29:33,576
Sure!

348
00:29:33,884 --> 00:29:37,479
Season's been pretty slow.
We got cancellations up the wahzoo.

349
00:29:39,556 --> 00:29:41,615
In that case I'll take it for the weekend.

350
00:29:41,725 --> 00:29:43,989
Okay. Paying cash, Mister B?

351
00:29:47,898 --> 00:29:49,866
Here. No need for a receipt.

352
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,763
Okay. Hey, good luck.

353
00:29:53,804 --> 00:29:55,499
- With what?
- The writing.

354
00:29:58,475 --> 00:29:59,499
Thanks.

355
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,631
I'm Odette Malroux.

356
00:30:30,974 --> 00:30:33,636
Odette, yeah, come in, come in.

357
00:30:36,012 --> 00:30:37,138
You...

358
00:30:44,388 --> 00:30:45,719
Can I get you a Coke or something?

359
00:30:45,789 --> 00:30:47,848
Do you have anything stronger than that?

360
00:30:48,992 --> 00:30:51,825
I don't know.
The law says you gotta be 21 to drink.

361
00:30:52,462 --> 00:30:53,224
So?

362
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:54,820
I always obey the law.

363
00:31:05,308 --> 00:31:07,401
My granddad used to wear suspenders.

364
00:31:11,081 --> 00:31:12,207
So did mine.

365
00:31:15,218 --> 00:31:17,083
So, is Harry Barber your real name...

366
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,585
...or did you make it up?

367
00:31:20,157 --> 00:31:21,454
You don't like it?

368
00:31:21,691 --> 00:31:23,022
No, I love it.

369
00:31:23,427 --> 00:31:24,917
Sounds delicious.

370
00:31:25,429 --> 00:31:28,091
It's just that you don't look
like a Harry Barber.

371
00:31:28,465 --> 00:31:31,263
What's a Harry Barber
supposed to look like?

372
00:31:31,735 --> 00:31:32,827
I don't know.

373
00:31:32,936 --> 00:31:34,426
I never met one before.

374
00:31:36,907 --> 00:31:39,273
Odette Malroux?
What kind of a name is that?

375
00:31:41,511 --> 00:31:43,103
Malroux's French.

376
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,777
Odette's on my mother's side.

377
00:31:45,916 --> 00:31:47,713
She was from New Orleans.

378
00:31:48,351 --> 00:31:49,443
Was?

379
00:31:51,388 --> 00:31:55,950
She drove herself off a cliff
in the Pyrenees mountains three years ago.

380
00:31:58,295 --> 00:31:59,626
I'm sorry to hear that.

381
00:31:59,996 --> 00:32:02,396
They never did figure out
if she meant to or not.

382
00:32:03,066 --> 00:32:05,728
So Rhea's your stepmother?

383
00:32:07,471 --> 00:32:11,168
I'd hardly call her my stepmother.
She's like a big sister.

384
00:32:12,042 --> 00:32:13,805
We're only 14 years apart.

385
00:32:14,144 --> 00:32:16,237
She calls you her stepdaughter.

386
00:32:16,346 --> 00:32:17,745
That's her problem.

387
00:32:26,256 --> 00:32:28,053
So, Odette...

388
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:32,392
- The reason I wanted you to come here...
- You want to know if I'm in on this.

389
00:32:34,331 --> 00:32:35,992
That's a good place to start.

390
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,824
Yes, what?

391
00:32:38,168 --> 00:32:40,500
Yes, I'm gonna pretend to be kidnapped.

392
00:32:40,637 --> 00:32:43,868
Yes, Rhea and I are gonna ask my father
for 500 grand.

393
00:32:44,007 --> 00:32:45,702
And, yes, he'll pay it.

394
00:32:45,909 --> 00:32:48,844
Yes, yes, yes.

395
00:32:54,818 --> 00:32:57,286
You mind if I ask what it is you...

396
00:32:58,722 --> 00:33:00,189
...need the money for?

397
00:33:01,725 --> 00:33:04,285
My father wants to send me away
to boarding school.

398
00:33:04,561 --> 00:33:08,327
An awful, boring Swiss school
run by awful, boring Swiss nuns.

399
00:33:09,032 --> 00:33:12,160
He doesn't like
the idea of me being so American.

400
00:33:12,269 --> 00:33:14,362
Tell him you don't want to go.

401
00:33:15,772 --> 00:33:17,137
Why don't you tell him?

402
00:33:19,476 --> 00:33:21,535
Why can't I ever find a match?

403
00:33:22,312 --> 00:33:24,712
Look, I love my father, I really do, but...

404
00:33:25,115 --> 00:33:27,413
...I'm not going away to that school.

405
00:33:28,184 --> 00:33:31,984
I figure 500 grand will get me through
till my 18th birthday.

406
00:33:32,322 --> 00:33:33,584
Then I'll be on my own.

407
00:33:33,657 --> 00:33:36,558
You think half a million
might last you till you're 18?

408
00:33:36,626 --> 00:33:38,059
You think it's enough?

409
00:33:39,629 --> 00:33:41,654
I don't really know much about money.

410
00:33:41,831 --> 00:33:43,492
Rhea came up with the amount.

411
00:33:43,667 --> 00:33:45,100
So this was her idea?

412
00:33:46,603 --> 00:33:48,002
I thought it up.

413
00:33:48,271 --> 00:33:49,499
Do you like it?

414
00:33:51,541 --> 00:33:54,510
- You ever see the inside of a jail cell?
- On TV.

415
00:33:54,811 --> 00:33:58,178
- They make it look pretty on TV.
- I'd just say it was all a prank.

416
00:33:58,348 --> 00:34:00,839
The cops won't think it's funny.
Neither will I.

417
00:34:01,217 --> 00:34:04,243
You're way too serious, Harry Barber.
Lighten up.

418
00:34:04,621 --> 00:34:08,216
- You son of a bitch, you hit me!
- Get out of here before I hit you again.

419
00:34:08,425 --> 00:34:09,915
- Get out of here!
- No!

420
00:34:10,126 --> 00:34:14,392
I don't play games when I could spend
the next 20 years of my life in prison.

421
00:34:14,497 --> 00:34:17,193
The cops will question you
till your ears bleed.

422
00:34:17,267 --> 00:34:19,701
- I'm a good liar.
- I don't doubt it.

423
00:34:27,277 --> 00:34:28,767
You got me right in the eye.

424
00:34:33,116 --> 00:34:34,310
I'm sorry.

425
00:34:35,151 --> 00:34:37,449
- Did I hurt you?
- Yeah, you hurt me!

426
00:34:38,955 --> 00:34:41,617
- Let me kiss it and make it better.
- Get off!

427
00:34:49,132 --> 00:34:52,397
I'm saying we need a story.
You know, a simple story.

428
00:34:53,737 --> 00:34:56,399
Let's say I meet a girlfriend Saturday night.

429
00:34:57,073 --> 00:34:59,974
Let's say we're gonna have a drink
and go to a movie.

430
00:35:00,477 --> 00:35:03,571
Let's say my girlfriend shows up
and can't find me...

431
00:35:04,581 --> 00:35:07,345
...because someone grabbed me
out of the parking lot.

432
00:35:09,986 --> 00:35:11,317
That's not bad.

433
00:35:11,755 --> 00:35:13,552
Needs work, but it's not bad.

434
00:35:17,594 --> 00:35:19,926
You're losing your hair, Mr. Barber.

435
00:35:38,114 --> 00:35:40,446
- How're you doing?
- Oh, just peachy.

436
00:35:40,617 --> 00:35:43,347
You look great.
I could gobble you right up.

437
00:35:45,955 --> 00:35:47,286
You invited your sister.

438
00:35:47,357 --> 00:35:50,190
Don't start. Of course I invited my sister.

439
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:53,286
She's married to a cop,
but he's not a cop anymore.

440
00:35:53,463 --> 00:35:56,125
Once a cop always a cop. Hi, Alda.

441
00:35:56,733 --> 00:35:57,859
Hi, Harry.

442
00:35:57,934 --> 00:36:00,528
- Hey, baby sister.
- How are you?

443
00:36:00,737 --> 00:36:01,863
How are you?

444
00:36:02,072 --> 00:36:05,132
- Hi, Nina. Nice work.
- John. Thanks.

445
00:36:05,341 --> 00:36:07,138
I've got something to tell you.

446
00:36:08,311 --> 00:36:10,711
Did you hear that the Ledger's got
a new owner?

447
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:12,808
I heard.

448
00:36:13,083 --> 00:36:15,984
- Nice guy. We play golf on a regular basis.
- So?

449
00:36:17,487 --> 00:36:18,511
So...

450
00:36:18,688 --> 00:36:22,055
...if that part-time marina job gets
a little old, let me know.

451
00:36:22,392 --> 00:36:24,986
- I could mention your name.
- Don't do me any favors.

452
00:36:38,842 --> 00:36:40,434
Hello, Mr. Barber.

453
00:36:41,878 --> 00:36:43,505
What the hell are you doing here?

454
00:36:43,713 --> 00:36:45,681
I'm just checking my facts.

455
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:47,839
Well?

456
00:36:51,254 --> 00:36:52,346
I'm in.

457
00:36:53,123 --> 00:36:54,522
Saturday night.

458
00:36:55,191 --> 00:36:58,422
I got everything worked out.
The girl knows exactly what to do.

459
00:36:59,095 --> 00:37:00,426
And what do I do?

460
00:37:02,432 --> 00:37:04,593
You make sure your husband...

461
00:37:05,101 --> 00:37:06,261
...finds this...

462
00:37:06,436 --> 00:37:08,529
...Sunday morning in the paper.

463
00:37:09,339 --> 00:37:11,864
It has a lock of Odette's hair
and a ransom note.

464
00:37:11,975 --> 00:37:15,172
That and a phone call should convince him
this is the real deal.

465
00:37:15,278 --> 00:37:16,438
And then?

466
00:37:16,646 --> 00:37:19,809
Then just try to act
like a grief-stricken stepmother.

467
00:38:19,676 --> 00:38:21,268
I'd like a Coca Cola.

468
00:39:04,821 --> 00:39:06,049
Bartender.

469
00:39:06,556 --> 00:39:08,046
This is for the Coke...

470
00:39:30,179 --> 00:39:31,168
All right.

471
00:39:33,383 --> 00:39:34,850
Fuckface, watch it!

472
00:39:35,652 --> 00:39:37,017
- Fuckface?
- Look what you did!

473
00:39:37,086 --> 00:39:39,646
- You put a fucking dent in my door.
- Look, I'm sorry.

474
00:39:39,822 --> 00:39:42,382
- No, fuck sorry! You can pay for it.
- Give me a break.

475
00:39:42,458 --> 00:39:45,256
- I didn't dent your door.
- That's 100 bucks to get fixed.

476
00:39:45,528 --> 00:39:48,395
- Let it go.
- I won't give you $100, young lady.

477
00:39:48,598 --> 00:39:51,362
- Your deductible's more than that.
- This is not good.

478
00:39:52,769 --> 00:39:55,704
- Don't fuck with me, mister!
- Don't screw around with me.

479
00:40:00,209 --> 00:40:01,870
Have you lost your mind?

480
00:40:02,245 --> 00:40:03,337
Get the wig.

481
00:40:04,314 --> 00:40:05,941
Now you've done it. Come on.

482
00:40:06,249 --> 00:40:07,341
Come on!

483
00:40:10,486 --> 00:40:11,748
Son of a bitch!

484
00:40:18,895 --> 00:40:19,953
Way to go.

485
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:23,197
- He hit my car!
- So have Daddy buy you another one.

486
00:40:23,299 --> 00:40:25,426
What if some jerk-off dented your door?

487
00:40:25,501 --> 00:40:28,766
I'd ignore it, because now
not only are we late, we have a witness.

488
00:40:28,972 --> 00:40:30,735
Don't worry, he didn't see you.

489
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,705
- You can be sure of that.
- Don't worry.

490
00:40:32,775 --> 00:40:35,903
I'm worried, okay? I'm worried.
I'm very, very worried.

491
00:40:40,683 --> 00:40:43,743
Rhea told me you were gonna get paid
$50,000 for this.

492
00:40:44,087 --> 00:40:45,145
So?

493
00:40:45,588 --> 00:40:48,614
You know what I said?
"If he's collecting ten times that...

494
00:40:48,691 --> 00:40:51,387
"...what makes you think
he won't take all the money and run?"

495
00:40:51,461 --> 00:40:53,929
This lipstick does not go with red hair.

496
00:40:54,597 --> 00:40:58,226
Anyway, she said you wouldn't
because you were predictably dishonest.

497
00:40:58,434 --> 00:40:59,628
She said that?

498
00:40:59,802 --> 00:41:01,667
She meant it as a compliment.

499
00:41:02,905 --> 00:41:05,601
Well, Harry Barber, are you predictable?

500
00:41:07,543 --> 00:41:09,602
I used to write for the Palmetto Ledger.

501
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:11,442
I don't read the newspaper.

502
00:41:11,647 --> 00:41:13,444
Why doesn't that surprise me?

503
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:17,618
I was covering a none too exciting meeting
in the city council...

504
00:41:17,887 --> 00:41:20,287
...I stepped out back to have a smoke...

505
00:41:20,857 --> 00:41:24,315
...and I noticed this brand new car
out there. Expensive, foreign...

506
00:41:24,427 --> 00:41:28,261
...the kind your daddy might drive,
but unusual in Palmetto.

507
00:41:28,965 --> 00:41:31,024
And then I see another new car.

508
00:41:31,401 --> 00:41:34,302
A big Lincoln.
I see another one and another one...

509
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:38,404
...and pretty soon I notice
there's half a dozen shiny new cars...

510
00:41:38,474 --> 00:41:41,341
...all parked in spots
reserved for the city council.

511
00:41:41,444 --> 00:41:43,036
What's wrong with shiny new cars?

512
00:41:43,146 --> 00:41:45,114
Nothing, except I discover...

513
00:41:45,248 --> 00:41:47,648
...that they just voted to allow...

514
00:41:48,351 --> 00:41:50,319
...gambling boats to dock at Palmetto.

515
00:41:50,386 --> 00:41:52,980
The zoning commission's in on it,
the cops...

516
00:41:53,156 --> 00:41:54,214
It's a big story.

517
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:57,885
I write it up. I drop it on the editor's desk.
Next day I come in...

518
00:41:57,994 --> 00:42:01,987
...and the owner of the paper himself
calls me into his office.

519
00:42:02,065 --> 00:42:06,126
I think he's gonna pin a medal on me.
Instead, he hands me a box of ashes.

520
00:42:06,235 --> 00:42:08,396
- All my hard work.
- Cocksucker.

521
00:42:08,571 --> 00:42:11,131
He tells me,
"Harry, I can't print your story.

522
00:42:11,841 --> 00:42:15,242
"Take the money and forget you ever knew
what a gambling boat was."

523
00:42:16,245 --> 00:42:18,805
Corruption at City Hall. What a shock.

524
00:42:18,881 --> 00:42:22,908
The shock came when that $10,000 ended
up in an account with my name on it.

525
00:42:22,985 --> 00:42:27,388
Instead of a Pulitzer Prize, I end up
serving two years of a four-year sentence.

526
00:42:28,558 --> 00:42:29,786
And that did it, huh?

527
00:42:29,859 --> 00:42:33,124
If someone offered you small bills
you'd take the money and run.

528
00:42:33,529 --> 00:42:36,430
- Am I right?
- You're very intuitive for your age.

529
00:42:51,214 --> 00:42:53,114
All right, tell me what you'll do.

530
00:42:53,483 --> 00:42:55,542
- Not again.
- Well, just come on.

531
00:42:56,052 --> 00:42:58,714
I buy a ticket using cash
in the name Anne Hardaway.

532
00:42:58,955 --> 00:43:02,220
When I get to Miami,
I check into the airport Holiday Inn. Yuck!

533
00:43:02,592 --> 00:43:05,254
And I don't come out of my room
until I hear from you.

534
00:43:05,328 --> 00:43:06,727
All right, that's good.

535
00:43:07,063 --> 00:43:08,121
Get going.

536
00:43:15,771 --> 00:43:17,261
You know, Harry Barber...

537
00:43:17,406 --> 00:43:19,135
...you don't look predictable.

538
00:43:19,509 --> 00:43:21,807
But I'm not a very good judge of character.

539
00:43:22,478 --> 00:43:23,604
How's that?

540
00:43:23,746 --> 00:43:26,408
I bet Rhea $100 you wouldn't
take the money from her purse.

541
00:43:26,482 --> 00:43:28,143
And you see, I lost.

542
00:43:32,755 --> 00:43:33,915
Why?

543
00:43:34,924 --> 00:43:36,892
Why didn't I pull out right then and there?

544
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:39,990
I asked myself that question
a thousand times.

545
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:42,593
Still I don't know why.

546
00:44:02,718 --> 00:44:04,015
I understand.

547
00:44:05,955 --> 00:44:07,183
I will pay.

548
00:44:08,391 --> 00:44:10,859
How do you want me
to hand you the money?

549
00:44:14,664 --> 00:44:16,188
I'll have it by tomorrow.

550
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:19,800
I'll have it by tomorrow.

551
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,131
Please don't hurt her.
You'll get your money.

552
00:44:35,518 --> 00:44:36,712
It's okay.

553
00:44:37,687 --> 00:44:38,881
It's okay.

554
00:44:41,891 --> 00:44:43,324
Thank you.

555
00:44:44,126 --> 00:44:45,559
Well, I hope this...

556
00:44:46,028 --> 00:44:47,859
...suits you a little better.

557
00:44:51,133 --> 00:44:52,532
Oh, it's just perfect.

558
00:44:52,768 --> 00:44:55,168
No, it's good, I mean, it's really good.

559
00:44:57,306 --> 00:44:58,500
Mr. Barber?

560
00:45:02,078 --> 00:45:05,411
Assistant DA Renick would like you
to come to the courthouse.

561
00:45:06,549 --> 00:45:07,777
What'd I do?

562
00:45:09,018 --> 00:45:10,747
Nothing that I know, sir.

563
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,750
I mean, am I under arrest, or...?

564
00:45:14,824 --> 00:45:16,314
Not that I know of, sir.

565
00:45:25,534 --> 00:45:26,762
Come on in.

566
00:45:27,403 --> 00:45:31,601
Sorry for the early wake-up call. I wanted
to get you in on this as soon as possible.

567
00:45:31,774 --> 00:45:33,708
Let me introduce you to my boss.

568
00:45:34,777 --> 00:45:37,644
Harry Barber,
District Attorney Miles Meadows. Boss...

569
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:39,211
This is Harry Barber.

570
00:45:39,515 --> 00:45:40,880
How are you, Barber?

571
00:45:41,284 --> 00:45:44,947
I'd be better if I knew
what I was doing in the DA's office...

572
00:45:45,254 --> 00:45:47,279
...at 9:00 on a Sunday morning.

573
00:45:47,823 --> 00:45:50,087
Ever heard of a man named Felix Malrow?

574
00:45:53,963 --> 00:45:55,021
Malroux.

575
00:45:56,132 --> 00:45:57,394
With an "x", right?

576
00:45:57,533 --> 00:45:59,398
I think it's French or something.

577
00:45:59,835 --> 00:46:00,927
Sorry.

578
00:46:01,037 --> 00:46:02,595
No smoking, public facility.

579
00:46:03,239 --> 00:46:05,264
- It's against the law.
- Of course.

580
00:46:06,309 --> 00:46:08,402
Did you ever hear of this guy or what?

581
00:46:10,479 --> 00:46:11,912
Just that he's rich.

582
00:46:14,383 --> 00:46:15,543
He's very rich.

583
00:46:15,651 --> 00:46:17,209
There's no law against that.

584
00:46:17,286 --> 00:46:20,449
I got a call this morning
from a banker acquaintance of mine.

585
00:46:20,623 --> 00:46:24,992
Seems this Malroux was especially anxious
to get his hands on $500,000...

586
00:46:25,161 --> 00:46:27,322
...in small bills as soon as possible.

587
00:46:29,065 --> 00:46:30,123
So?

588
00:46:31,033 --> 00:46:32,432
Tell him about the girl.

589
00:46:33,369 --> 00:46:35,428
Malrow, Malroux...

590
00:46:36,105 --> 00:46:39,438
...has got a daughter. Very young, 16, 17.

591
00:46:39,742 --> 00:46:42,575
She went to meet a friend last night
and never came home.

592
00:46:43,346 --> 00:46:44,711
Maybe she eloped.

593
00:46:44,814 --> 00:46:46,509
She doesn't have a boyfriend.

594
00:46:48,651 --> 00:46:52,143
Well, so maybe this Malroux is
a lousy poker player.

595
00:46:52,221 --> 00:46:54,689
Maybe he wants
to wallpaper his bathroom.

596
00:46:55,658 --> 00:46:58,752
Harry, Malroux's bodyguard is an ex-cop.

597
00:46:59,328 --> 00:47:02,923
I just spoke to him. He confirmed
the girl did not come home last night.

598
00:47:03,799 --> 00:47:06,131
The first sign of trouble was last night.

599
00:47:06,202 --> 00:47:09,467
They received a call from the girlfriend
wondering where she was.

600
00:47:09,772 --> 00:47:12,036
This morning,
Malroux received a ransom note...

601
00:47:12,108 --> 00:47:15,305
...and a lock of her hair
tucked inside the Sunday paper.

602
00:47:15,578 --> 00:47:19,446
There was also a phone call at midnight
from someone claiming to have the girl.

603
00:47:24,854 --> 00:47:26,344
That sounds convincing.

604
00:47:27,656 --> 00:47:31,148
You still haven't told me
what it is you called me down here for.

605
00:47:32,061 --> 00:47:34,894
Sooner or later the press is gonna
get a hold of this.

606
00:47:35,264 --> 00:47:37,164
You know exactly what that means.

607
00:47:38,401 --> 00:47:42,735
We need somebody to handle it,
act as the press liaison for the DA's office.

608
00:47:43,072 --> 00:47:44,334
'Course...

609
00:47:45,074 --> 00:47:46,564
...you'll be on the payroll.

610
00:47:49,111 --> 00:47:50,738
You're offering me a job.

611
00:47:56,585 --> 00:47:57,677
So...

612
00:47:58,654 --> 00:47:59,814
...why me?

613
00:48:00,189 --> 00:48:02,350
Renick told me all about you.

614
00:48:08,631 --> 00:48:10,360
Told me what they did to you.

615
00:48:11,967 --> 00:48:13,559
We need somebody like you.

616
00:48:14,303 --> 00:48:17,534
Somebody with integrity.
Somebody who's incorruptible.

617
00:48:19,909 --> 00:48:22,036
You know the press, you're one of them.

618
00:48:22,711 --> 00:48:25,942
I don't want this thing to turn ugly,
become a circus.

619
00:48:26,582 --> 00:48:28,209
The stakes are too high.

620
00:48:29,318 --> 00:48:31,149
Right. It's an election year.

621
00:48:32,521 --> 00:48:33,715
Look, Harry...

622
00:48:34,356 --> 00:48:37,416
Malroux hasn't come to us yet.
That's why we can't act.

623
00:48:37,526 --> 00:48:39,551
At least not officially anyway.

624
00:48:39,862 --> 00:48:42,660
That's why this thing has gotta be handled
very carefully.

625
00:48:43,432 --> 00:48:47,732
Once the press gets this, there's no telling
what might happen to the girl.

626
00:48:50,372 --> 00:48:52,465
What do you say? Will you do it?

627
00:49:00,483 --> 00:49:02,110
Sure. Glad to help.

628
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:05,853
Thanks for coming, Harry.

629
00:49:05,921 --> 00:49:06,910
Sure.

630
00:49:07,223 --> 00:49:08,383
Pleasure.

631
00:49:12,328 --> 00:49:15,923
We'll set you up in here.
There won't be much to do now, but...

632
00:49:16,165 --> 00:49:19,657
...I got a feeling this is
the calm before the storm. Okay?

633
00:49:19,935 --> 00:49:20,993
Thanks.

634
00:49:21,337 --> 00:49:22,497
I owe you one.

635
00:49:23,072 --> 00:49:24,437
Is that gratitude?

636
00:49:24,807 --> 00:49:27,833
Let's say that you and Palmetto
are even now, all right?

637
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:49,088
Hello?

638
00:49:49,331 --> 00:49:50,229
It's me.

639
00:49:50,299 --> 00:49:51,266
Who?

640
00:49:51,333 --> 00:49:53,062
Turn that damn thing down.

641
00:49:54,670 --> 00:49:56,570
Is that you, Harry Barber?

642
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,767
We're calling the whole thing off.

643
00:50:00,142 --> 00:50:01,404
What do you mean off?

644
00:50:01,544 --> 00:50:05,071
I mean, off as in over, kaput,
done, finished.

645
00:50:05,948 --> 00:50:07,313
I think you're scared.

646
00:50:07,483 --> 00:50:10,316
You're damn right.
The cops know all about this.

647
00:50:11,186 --> 00:50:13,711
Get your ass on a plane and get back here.
Understand?

648
00:50:13,789 --> 00:50:15,552
Not until you get me my money.

649
00:50:16,158 --> 00:50:18,558
I'm the one calling the shots around here.

650
00:50:18,827 --> 00:50:20,556
You're just the hired help.

651
00:50:20,896 --> 00:50:23,922
If you don't get me my money
I'll do something stupid and adolescent.

652
00:50:23,999 --> 00:50:27,332
I'll call the cops and tell them
what you did to me in that bungalow.

653
00:51:05,474 --> 00:51:06,532
Thanks.

654
00:51:09,878 --> 00:51:11,778
Something on your mind, Harry?

655
00:51:12,348 --> 00:51:13,440
The girl.

656
00:51:14,383 --> 00:51:15,611
Odette Malroux?

657
00:51:17,353 --> 00:51:19,412
You guys act like you got the biggest...

658
00:51:19,555 --> 00:51:23,218
...kidnap case since the Lindbergh baby.
No offense, but...

659
00:51:23,525 --> 00:51:25,550
...you might be on a wild-goose chase.

660
00:51:25,661 --> 00:51:28,221
Believe me,
the thought has crossed my mind.

661
00:51:29,264 --> 00:51:33,064
I wouldn't be surprised if she showed up
and announced it was all a big joke.

662
00:51:33,702 --> 00:51:35,135
Oh, I'd like that.

663
00:51:41,343 --> 00:51:42,435
What?

664
00:51:45,881 --> 00:51:47,109
All right.

665
00:52:07,836 --> 00:52:08,962
Our ex-cop.

666
00:52:09,571 --> 00:52:12,734
The girl just phoned her father,
said if he didn't pay the ransom...

667
00:52:12,875 --> 00:52:15,105
...she'd be sent home one piece at a time.

668
00:52:20,416 --> 00:52:22,008
Still think this is a joke?

669
00:52:23,886 --> 00:52:25,114
I guess not.

670
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:36,325
I'm gonna go. I have to get my typewriter.
I can't use these computers.

671
00:52:36,732 --> 00:52:38,996
We can dig you up
a typewriter around here, no problem.

672
00:52:39,068 --> 00:52:43,027
No, that's okay. I gotta use my own.
Call me superstitious.

673
00:52:44,139 --> 00:52:45,436
Sure, go ahead.

674
00:52:45,774 --> 00:52:48,242
- Just stick near a phone, all right?
- You got it.

675
00:53:05,661 --> 00:53:09,392
People I was worried would get involved
are already involved.

676
00:53:09,698 --> 00:53:10,995
Where can I meet you?

677
00:53:11,467 --> 00:53:12,525
The beach.

678
00:53:12,634 --> 00:53:14,499
Okay, I'll be there in 20 minutes.

679
00:53:40,696 --> 00:53:43,187
What seems to be the problem,
Mr. Barber?

680
00:53:44,566 --> 00:53:46,033
How'd you get in here?

681
00:53:46,201 --> 00:53:47,259
Easy.

682
00:53:47,569 --> 00:53:49,366
The door was wide open.

683
00:53:50,739 --> 00:53:52,366
The cops are involved.

684
00:53:54,476 --> 00:53:56,535
- How did that happen?
- You tell me.

685
00:53:56,678 --> 00:54:00,978
For starters, that pitbull, Donnelly,
is an ex-cop, or didn't you know that?

686
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:03,244
How would I?

687
00:54:03,352 --> 00:54:06,549
The same way you knew
that I'd take that money out of your purse.

688
00:54:06,688 --> 00:54:08,679
You can't believe everything Odette says.

689
00:54:08,757 --> 00:54:10,122
Yeah, speaking of...

690
00:54:10,259 --> 00:54:13,319
...that silly little stepdaughter of yours
is taking matters in her own hands.

691
00:54:13,395 --> 00:54:15,386
- She phoned...
- Her father, I know.

692
00:54:15,464 --> 00:54:17,523
- How did you know?
- How did you know?

693
00:54:17,633 --> 00:54:20,796
You said your husband wouldn't
involve the authorities.

694
00:54:20,903 --> 00:54:23,394
- Yeah, well, he isn't.
- Somebody has.

695
00:54:23,472 --> 00:54:25,099
Well, it wasn't him.

696
00:54:25,941 --> 00:54:29,570
He's a sick man. He loves his daughter.
He's not about to trust the police.

697
00:54:29,678 --> 00:54:32,306
What I don't understand is
why the hell he'd trust you.

698
00:54:37,719 --> 00:54:38,913
Get off me!

699
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:53,358
The money's there.

700
00:54:53,869 --> 00:54:56,337
It's all there. It's at the house.

701
00:54:56,772 --> 00:54:59,206
The president of the bank
dropped it off himself.

702
00:54:59,541 --> 00:55:01,065
It's $500,000!

703
00:55:01,810 --> 00:55:02,936
Come on.

704
00:55:05,714 --> 00:55:07,375
Unless you're not up to it.

705
00:55:10,018 --> 00:55:11,986
Maybe we should call the whole thing off.

706
00:55:13,789 --> 00:55:14,881
Fine.

707
00:55:34,643 --> 00:55:36,634
You know, this still could work.

708
00:55:37,446 --> 00:55:38,913
It's gotta be tonight.

709
00:55:40,582 --> 00:55:42,447
I'll set a time and a place.

710
00:55:44,486 --> 00:55:48,422
After I make the pickup, I'll call the house.
Make sure that you answer.

711
00:55:49,358 --> 00:55:52,486
If anybody asks,
tell them you're going to see Odette.

712
00:55:52,761 --> 00:55:55,696
We meet back here,
we can split up the money.

713
00:55:56,431 --> 00:55:58,092
Unless, of course...

714
00:55:58,433 --> 00:56:00,094
...you don't trust me.

715
00:56:02,604 --> 00:56:03,832
I trust you.

716
00:56:29,965 --> 00:56:31,296
Just remember:

717
00:56:32,968 --> 00:56:34,401
Watch what you say.

718
00:56:36,638 --> 00:56:38,538
Donnelly's an ear for the police.

719
00:56:38,607 --> 00:56:39,904
I'll be careful.

720
00:57:19,181 --> 00:57:20,671
What took you so long?

721
00:57:23,852 --> 00:57:25,843
He needed a little encouragement.

722
00:57:26,989 --> 00:57:28,013
How?

723
00:58:58,576 --> 00:59:00,771
- Fax for Miss Hardaway.
- Thanks.

724
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:11,589
I take it back, Harry Barber.
You are predictable.

725
00:59:11,756 --> 00:59:13,280
Yeah, are you there?

726
00:59:13,458 --> 00:59:14,447
Pick up.

727
00:59:14,959 --> 00:59:16,119
It's me.

728
00:59:18,196 --> 00:59:22,030
Listen, I'm sorry I didn't get to you sooner.
It's a busy day and...

729
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:26,127
...it's like the crime of the century's
going on at the DA's office...

730
00:59:26,204 --> 00:59:28,866
...and Renick wants me to be press liaison.

731
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:32,032
I can't talk about it, but, I just-

732
00:59:32,310 --> 00:59:34,141
Well, I'm gonna be late.

733
00:59:34,612 --> 00:59:37,945
I'm gonna be very late,
so don't wait up. Bye-bye.

734
00:59:57,802 --> 01:00:00,794
In an hour this'll be over.
You'll have your money.

735
01:00:01,005 --> 01:00:02,597
And you'll have yours.

736
01:00:03,975 --> 01:00:06,739
All right, get on in there and wait for me.

737
01:00:09,547 --> 01:00:10,844
You know...

738
01:00:11,249 --> 01:00:13,911
I can't help but think about
what happened in that bungalow.

739
01:00:14,285 --> 01:00:16,048
What? Nothing happened.

740
01:00:16,287 --> 01:00:17,413
I know.

741
01:00:17,755 --> 01:00:19,052
It's a shame.

742
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:10,401
Sure you don't want me to come?

743
01:01:10,475 --> 01:01:12,705
The instructions said to come alone.

744
01:01:12,844 --> 01:01:14,607
I can't risk my child's life.

745
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:17,238
Okay.

746
01:02:58,216 --> 01:02:59,205
We did it.

747
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:01,242
We sure as hell did it.

748
01:03:04,088 --> 01:03:05,851
You want to check this out?

749
01:03:07,959 --> 01:03:09,859
Wake up, sleeping beauty.

750
01:03:11,629 --> 01:03:12,960
What are you, drunk?

751
01:04:56,801 --> 01:04:58,359
You're a fucking idiot.

752
01:04:58,903 --> 01:05:00,632
Straight back to jail.

753
01:05:01,038 --> 01:05:02,471
Straight back.

754
01:05:03,808 --> 01:05:05,469
You fucking did it.

755
01:05:08,646 --> 01:05:10,136
Twenty years.

756
01:05:11,282 --> 01:05:12,943
Christ, you did it!

757
01:05:14,819 --> 01:05:17,014
Come on! Come on!

758
01:05:17,822 --> 01:05:18,982
Just light!

759
01:05:19,490 --> 01:05:20,616
Just light!

760
01:05:22,727 --> 01:05:23,887
Fuck!

761
01:05:24,528 --> 01:05:25,688
Fuck!

762
01:06:00,965 --> 01:06:02,762
Son of a bitch.

763
01:06:09,707 --> 01:06:11,538
You all right under there?

764
01:06:17,148 --> 01:06:21,107
I took my eye off the road for one second
and I slid into a guardrail.

765
01:06:21,786 --> 01:06:22,878
Been drinking?

766
01:06:22,953 --> 01:06:24,545
No, I don't drink.

767
01:06:26,290 --> 01:06:28,281
- This yours?
- Girlfriend's.

768
01:06:29,260 --> 01:06:32,024
Sir, let me see
your license and registration, please.

769
01:06:39,003 --> 01:06:41,733
You know, I work at the DA's office.

770
01:06:42,173 --> 01:06:44,937
I don't know if it's too late,
but you could contact...

771
01:06:45,042 --> 01:06:49,308
...the assistant DA, John Renick, there.
He could vouch for me.

772
01:06:49,814 --> 01:06:51,509
You mean the John Renick?

773
01:06:52,183 --> 01:06:53,411
You know him?

774
01:06:53,884 --> 01:06:56,318
- We went to the Academy together.
- God.

775
01:06:56,821 --> 01:06:59,085
He's my girl... my wife-

776
01:06:59,590 --> 01:07:01,990
No, my girlfriend's sister's boy-

777
01:07:02,526 --> 01:07:03,652
Husband.

778
01:07:05,329 --> 01:07:08,423
- He's a good cop.
- A great cop, according to him.

779
01:07:09,667 --> 01:07:11,328
Look, I got an idea.

780
01:07:11,535 --> 01:07:13,093
Open up that trunk there.

781
01:07:13,270 --> 01:07:16,103
We'll get the spare out
and I'll help you fix that tire.

782
01:07:19,276 --> 01:07:20,334
All right.

783
01:07:29,620 --> 01:07:30,951
You know...

784
01:07:31,689 --> 01:07:35,216
...the spare is no, is no good.
No good spare.

785
01:07:36,193 --> 01:07:37,524
Well, you sure?

786
01:07:38,696 --> 01:07:40,288
Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm...

787
01:07:41,365 --> 01:07:43,060
No, I'm positive. It's-

788
01:07:43,134 --> 01:07:45,034
My girlfriend had a flat.

789
01:07:45,836 --> 01:07:46,825
Well...

790
01:07:46,937 --> 01:07:50,805
We might better check and take a look-see.
Maybe she got it fixed.

791
01:07:50,975 --> 01:07:53,705
No. She wouldn't, 'cause she's...
You know, women.

792
01:07:53,778 --> 01:07:55,643
They don't care about...

793
01:07:56,147 --> 01:07:57,444
...spare tires. They-

794
01:07:57,515 --> 01:08:01,076
I know women.
It'd be foolish not to check, though.

795
01:08:01,218 --> 01:08:03,482
No, but I know my girlfriend. She-

796
01:08:04,989 --> 01:08:07,822
Why don't we just pop her open anyway,
take a look?

797
01:08:07,992 --> 01:08:10,085
Might be surprised at what we find.

798
01:08:10,227 --> 01:08:11,660
Go on, open her up.

799
01:08:31,015 --> 01:08:32,175
Shit!

800
01:08:32,416 --> 01:08:34,179
Well, I'll be damned!

801
01:08:35,152 --> 01:08:36,619
How about them bananas?

802
01:08:37,488 --> 01:08:39,922
Done broke it off. I'll tell you what, I'II...

803
01:08:39,990 --> 01:08:42,117
I'll just call you a tow truck, all right?

804
01:08:42,193 --> 01:08:43,421
- Thanks.
- You bet.

805
01:08:43,627 --> 01:08:45,356
- Very kind.
- You're welcome.

806
01:09:12,289 --> 01:09:13,313
Thanks.

807
01:09:15,159 --> 01:09:16,387
Here's $10...

808
01:09:16,493 --> 01:09:18,552
...$25, that's $30.

809
01:09:18,729 --> 01:09:20,754
Thirty? That's 50 bucks for the tow.

810
01:09:20,865 --> 01:09:22,560
Fifty bucks! Give me a break.

811
01:09:22,666 --> 01:09:25,328
That car won't come off the hook
until you pay me.

812
01:09:25,402 --> 01:09:26,562
Come on.

813
01:09:27,571 --> 01:09:30,369
- All right, I'll be right back.
- I'll be here.

814
01:09:32,409 --> 01:09:33,899
Is that you, Harry?

815
01:09:34,478 --> 01:09:36,070
Go back to sleep, baby.

816
01:10:59,663 --> 01:11:01,824
John? Yeah, here he is. Hold on.

817
01:11:10,574 --> 01:11:12,565
Harry, it's John on the phone.

818
01:11:23,220 --> 01:11:27,281
New development. Mr. Malroux just
called us. His daughter didn't show up.

819
01:11:27,491 --> 01:11:31,723
Now we're officially involved. We need you
to write a statement, a press release.

820
01:11:33,297 --> 01:11:34,924
I'll be right there.

821
01:11:35,199 --> 01:11:37,861
Oh, hey, I need someone to pick me up.

822
01:11:37,935 --> 01:11:39,926
- Yeah, just sit tight.
- Thanks.

823
01:11:43,574 --> 01:11:45,098
What's happening?

824
01:11:45,409 --> 01:11:49,846
This case I'm working on,
a kidnapping case, the girl was...

825
01:11:50,014 --> 01:11:53,211
...kidnapped, the money was given, but...

826
01:11:54,051 --> 01:11:56,315
...she was never returned. And now-

827
01:11:57,321 --> 01:11:59,221
Seems to really be affecting you.

828
01:12:01,658 --> 01:12:03,023
Did you know her?

829
01:12:07,765 --> 01:12:10,290
No, it's just that- Well, of course not.

830
01:12:13,237 --> 01:12:14,397
So...

831
01:12:15,272 --> 01:12:17,638
...that's why you started drinking again?

832
01:12:19,176 --> 01:12:21,804
A guy's entitled to a drink
every once in a while.

833
01:12:21,912 --> 01:12:24,642
You were the one who said
it affected your judgment.

834
01:12:25,149 --> 01:12:28,084
Well, I was wrong.
My judgment's as bad as it ever was.

835
01:12:30,387 --> 01:12:32,082
What's going on, Harry?

836
01:12:36,427 --> 01:12:37,416
Tell me.

837
01:12:54,745 --> 01:12:58,647
So, what was it that finally
got Malroux to call in the calvary?

838
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:02,048
- Wife talked him into it.
- His wife?

839
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:04,280
It's about time.

840
01:13:04,488 --> 01:13:08,288
We've been in touch with the FBI.
They're sending up an agent this afternoon.

841
01:13:08,459 --> 01:13:09,790
Stop here.

842
01:13:18,168 --> 01:13:20,898
- It was exactly here, Mr. Renick.
- Right there?

843
01:13:21,038 --> 01:13:23,233
I set the odometer when I left home.

844
01:13:23,307 --> 01:13:25,138
Let's go check that out.

845
01:13:25,209 --> 01:13:26,267
Come on, let's go!

846
01:13:26,343 --> 01:13:27,742
Hey, over here!

847
01:13:27,878 --> 01:13:30,870
Get some plastic on that.
We need that thing protected.

848
01:13:34,017 --> 01:13:35,814
That's a footprint. Great.

849
01:13:36,220 --> 01:13:37,414
All right.

850
01:13:38,322 --> 01:13:39,550
Hey, Harry.

851
01:13:40,357 --> 01:13:43,155
Put your foot over next to this print here.

852
01:13:45,295 --> 01:13:47,058
What size shoe are you wearing?

853
01:13:47,431 --> 01:13:49,365
Same size as the kidnapper.

854
01:13:51,268 --> 01:13:54,066
- Come on, where's that plastic?
- I got tire tracks!

855
01:13:59,109 --> 01:14:01,577
I can tell you he was no pro,
that's for sure.

856
01:14:02,146 --> 01:14:05,877
Whole thing's sloppy, half-assed
and not very well thought out.

857
01:14:06,083 --> 01:14:07,243
I bet he's local.

858
01:14:10,521 --> 01:14:13,684
Let's get somebody on these tracks!
We don't want them covered up.

859
01:14:16,527 --> 01:14:18,688
It could be important evidence
you're standing on.

860
01:14:18,762 --> 01:14:19,854
Sorry.

861
01:14:24,101 --> 01:14:25,898
Am I still needed, Mr. Renick?

862
01:14:26,236 --> 01:14:28,796
Yes, sir. I'll be right there, Mr. Malroux.

863
01:14:28,872 --> 01:14:31,204
Who is that guy with Malroux?

864
01:14:31,575 --> 01:14:33,873
That's Donnelly,
the ex-cop I told you about.

865
01:14:34,111 --> 01:14:37,478
- Looks familiar.
- Maybe you remember his face from TV.

866
01:14:38,282 --> 01:14:40,443
He was the bagman
for that crooked bunch at City Hall.

867
01:14:40,517 --> 01:14:44,476
He plea-bargained his way out of jail time,
but he still had to quit the force.

868
01:14:46,623 --> 01:14:49,615
It was his testimony
that sprung you out of prison.

869
01:15:06,109 --> 01:15:07,133
Damn!

870
01:15:07,344 --> 01:15:10,279
Told you they'd be all over this
like shit on a stick.

871
01:15:10,514 --> 01:15:14,314
It's time for you to earn your keep,
my friend. Keep them off me, brother.

872
01:15:14,585 --> 01:15:15,643
In-law.

873
01:15:27,764 --> 01:15:31,325
- There'll be a press conference upstairs...
- Are you involved in this?

874
01:15:32,936 --> 01:15:34,267
...in three minutes.

875
01:15:39,710 --> 01:15:40,836
My name's...

876
01:15:40,978 --> 01:15:44,379
...Harry Barber. I'll be the press liaison
for the DA's office.

877
01:15:47,684 --> 01:15:50,312
I used to be one of you, so I know
how anxious you are to get going...

878
01:15:50,387 --> 01:15:52,878
...but I'll ask everybody to turn off
their cameras...

879
01:15:52,956 --> 01:15:56,585
...and turn off
their tape recording devices, please.

880
01:15:57,060 --> 01:15:59,051
Do as I'm asking you, please-

881
01:16:00,364 --> 01:16:02,195
You see, I...

882
01:16:02,466 --> 01:16:04,661
The DA's office and the police department...

883
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:06,862
How come they let you out of jail?

884
01:16:08,305 --> 01:16:11,536
...have asked that you hold off
on your story for the next 24 hours.

885
01:16:11,842 --> 01:16:13,036
Why is that?

886
01:16:13,110 --> 01:16:15,840
We don't know
a heck of a lot more than you.

887
01:16:15,946 --> 01:16:18,813
Pretty much what you all received
in your statement.

888
01:16:19,082 --> 01:16:21,175
And thank you. So...

889
01:16:21,785 --> 01:16:24,345
...the district attorney doesn't want to...

890
01:16:24,554 --> 01:16:27,785
...jeopardize this girl's situation
if we break this story too soon.

891
01:16:27,858 --> 01:16:32,591
We're not just talking about kidnapping,
we're talking about a murder case.

892
01:16:32,663 --> 01:16:35,291
- That's not true.
- Do they have a suspect?

893
01:16:36,033 --> 01:16:39,400
- lf not, they will soon, right?
- lf the girl's already dead...

894
01:16:39,903 --> 01:16:41,894
...why are we sitting on this story?

895
01:16:42,239 --> 01:16:46,073
- They're just trying to flush the killer out.
- Throw us a bone.

896
01:16:50,547 --> 01:16:52,014
Kind of rough, huh?

897
01:16:55,852 --> 01:16:58,844
You know the press;
they think they know everything.

898
01:16:59,156 --> 01:17:01,147
They'll cooperate though, right?

899
01:17:01,558 --> 01:17:02,786
Yeah, for now.

900
01:17:04,194 --> 01:17:06,560
What about you? Anything I should know?

901
01:17:07,864 --> 01:17:11,857
We sent the ransom note
and the drop-off instructions to the FBI.

902
01:17:11,935 --> 01:17:14,927
We'll just wait and see
what they'll come up with.

903
01:17:15,205 --> 01:17:17,503
What do you mean? Like fingerprints?

904
01:17:17,708 --> 01:17:18,936
Fingerprints?

905
01:17:19,042 --> 01:17:21,135
The guy's dumb, not brain-dead.

906
01:17:21,812 --> 01:17:25,145
They'll take saliva samples
from the envelopes, the cigarette butt...

907
01:17:25,615 --> 01:17:27,082
Profile his DNA with it.

908
01:17:28,685 --> 01:17:29,811
DNA?

909
01:17:30,087 --> 01:17:31,418
They can do that?

910
01:17:32,656 --> 01:17:34,123
Don't you watch TV?

911
01:17:34,224 --> 01:17:36,886
There's something more concrete
I want to show you.

912
01:17:37,027 --> 01:17:39,257
Some people might call this luck.

913
01:17:39,463 --> 01:17:42,364
I'd like to look at it
as good investigative work.

914
01:17:43,667 --> 01:17:46,602
Checked the routine police report
the night the girl was taken.

915
01:17:46,770 --> 01:17:47,862
Oh, it's hot.

916
01:17:48,372 --> 01:17:53,036
This guy was discovered out cold in
the parking lot, right next to the girl's car.

917
01:17:53,610 --> 01:17:56,704
- Somebody gave him a thump on the head.
- Is that right?

918
01:17:58,682 --> 01:18:00,013
I look like hell.

919
01:18:02,519 --> 01:18:05,682
And he had receding brownish-blonde hair.

920
01:18:06,490 --> 01:18:08,651
He was about that tall.

921
01:18:09,192 --> 01:18:11,524
Had to be about, God, about yea wide.

922
01:18:12,262 --> 01:18:14,856
And he had kind of a small
but longish face.

923
01:18:14,998 --> 01:18:16,329
Jesus, Harry.

924
01:18:16,700 --> 01:18:18,292
He could be talking about you.

925
01:18:19,703 --> 01:18:22,001
Yeah, me and a hundred other guys.

926
01:18:23,173 --> 01:18:26,108
- I'm gonna grab some lunch.
- All right. Go ahead.

927
01:18:26,209 --> 01:18:28,074
It turned out to be a red wig.

928
01:18:32,949 --> 01:18:36,282
I forgot. Nina called,
said she couldn't find her car keys.

929
01:18:37,888 --> 01:18:38,946
The car.

930
01:19:39,015 --> 01:19:40,277
Are you here?

931
01:19:40,383 --> 01:19:42,874
Do you have the keys? I need my car.

932
01:19:44,654 --> 01:19:46,121
What are you doing?

933
01:19:48,525 --> 01:19:50,516
What are you doing with that briefcase?

934
01:19:51,862 --> 01:19:53,193
Nothing, I just-

935
01:19:53,597 --> 01:19:55,588
It doesn't concern you, Nina.

936
01:19:56,199 --> 01:19:58,224
If it concerns you, it concerns me.

937
01:19:58,435 --> 01:19:59,663
Not this time.

938
01:20:01,171 --> 01:20:04,663
- Tell me what's in the briefcase.
- Nothing's in the briefcase.

939
01:20:05,675 --> 01:20:07,074
What's going on?

940
01:20:07,310 --> 01:20:09,744
Nina, nothing is going on. Nothing.

941
01:20:12,616 --> 01:20:14,481
This is about that girl, isn't it?

942
01:20:15,752 --> 01:20:17,481
The one that was kidnapped.

943
01:20:24,561 --> 01:20:27,052
I need a few minutes alone, right now.

944
01:20:38,842 --> 01:20:41,072
- Where are you going?
- I need to take my car.

945
01:20:42,078 --> 01:20:43,705
- No, no, not now.
- Why not?

946
01:20:43,780 --> 01:20:46,544
- Just not now, Nina.
- Harry, what is going on?

947
01:20:46,616 --> 01:20:49,813
Nothing! Nothing's going on!
Nothing! Okay?

948
01:20:50,086 --> 01:20:51,280
Nothing!

949
01:20:57,627 --> 01:20:59,288
It's the girl, isn't it?

950
01:21:05,869 --> 01:21:09,202
Harry, answer me.
The girl, she's in the garage, isn't she?

951
01:21:19,449 --> 01:21:20,541
Dead?

952
01:21:26,323 --> 01:21:27,722
Did you kill her?

953
01:21:30,727 --> 01:21:32,251
I didn't kill anybody.

954
01:21:42,706 --> 01:21:45,197
God, I knew something was wrong, Harry.

955
01:21:46,776 --> 01:21:49,711
Now you see why I didn't want
to get you involved.

956
01:21:50,246 --> 01:21:51,270
Okay.

957
01:21:52,182 --> 01:21:53,581
What do we do now?

958
01:21:54,517 --> 01:21:57,179
One thing's for sure.
We gotta get rid of the body.

959
01:21:57,287 --> 01:21:59,050
God, don't talk like that.

960
01:21:59,155 --> 01:22:03,148
I'm sorry. I'm not a good little scout
lost in the woods. Not anymore.

961
01:22:04,461 --> 01:22:06,986
We'll rent a car
and dump the body somewhere.

962
01:22:07,530 --> 01:22:10,055
We have all the money we need right here.

963
01:22:18,775 --> 01:22:19,935
Oh, God.

964
01:22:22,445 --> 01:22:26,745
I thought I was one step ahead of her.
She played me like Chinese chess.

965
01:22:28,485 --> 01:22:31,181
Checkers.
Are you talking about Rhea Malroux?

966
01:22:32,856 --> 01:22:36,348
All she wanted was the girl dead
and somebody to pin it on.

967
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:38,286
Why?

968
01:22:39,329 --> 01:22:41,627
I don't know. It doesn't make sense.

969
01:22:43,266 --> 01:22:46,793
Unless she wanted the whole fortune
to herself after the old man dies.

970
01:22:46,970 --> 01:22:50,167
- You think she killed her daughter?
- Stepdaughter. Not a chance.

971
01:22:52,142 --> 01:22:54,372
Maybe there's somebody else involved.

972
01:22:55,979 --> 01:22:58,072
Maybe Rhea Malroux's got a friend.

973
01:23:01,851 --> 01:23:02,977
Donnelly.

974
01:23:03,119 --> 01:23:04,313
Who's that?

975
01:23:07,457 --> 01:23:08,685
Don't answer it.

976
01:23:09,125 --> 01:23:10,319
It'll be John Renick.

977
01:23:10,427 --> 01:23:14,261
It's a matter of time before he comes up
with the name Harry Barber.

978
01:23:14,364 --> 01:23:17,333
Why don't you tell John what happened?
He'll believe you.

979
01:23:17,434 --> 01:23:21,928
That I was gonna extort a half a million
from Malroux and not kill his daughter?

980
01:23:22,038 --> 01:23:23,198
It's the truth.

981
01:23:23,273 --> 01:23:25,400
It'll be Rhea's word against mine.

982
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:31,469
What?

983
01:23:32,816 --> 01:23:34,613
Rhea Malroux's word.

984
01:24:06,616 --> 01:24:08,777
I've got a message from Harry Barber.

985
01:24:09,919 --> 01:24:11,352
Who's Harry Barber?

986
01:24:11,788 --> 01:24:13,312
Maybe this will ring a bell.

987
01:24:13,456 --> 01:24:15,856
My stepdaughter's got to be kidnapped.

988
01:24:17,093 --> 01:24:19,425
The ransom will be $500,000.

989
01:24:20,697 --> 01:24:23,928
I need someone to be
the threatening voice on the telephone.

990
01:24:24,134 --> 01:24:27,126
For the call and collecting the ransom
I'm willing to pay...

991
01:24:27,403 --> 01:24:29,371
- I've heard enough.
...ten percent.

992
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:32,231
What does this have to do with me?

993
01:24:32,776 --> 01:24:34,801
You're fucking Rhea Malroux, for starters.

994
01:24:34,878 --> 01:24:36,106
What do you want?

995
01:24:36,246 --> 01:24:39,181
There's a body of the girl
in the trunk of my car.

996
01:24:39,983 --> 01:24:43,180
It needs to be taken care of
or somebody's gonna find it.

997
01:24:43,286 --> 01:24:46,153
- And if it's taken care of?
- Nobody will hear the tape...

998
01:24:46,256 --> 01:24:48,520
...and you can go on fucking Rhea Malroux.

999
01:24:50,827 --> 01:24:52,522
I expect to hear from you.

1000
01:24:56,699 --> 01:24:58,758
I'm not the only one who fucked Rhea.

1001
01:24:58,835 --> 01:25:02,327
Maybe you should listen
to the rest of your tape, sweetheart.

1002
01:25:06,576 --> 01:25:08,203
In all of this...

1003
01:25:08,745 --> 01:25:10,542
...excitement, Mr. Barber...

1004
01:25:11,247 --> 01:25:13,807
...I don't remember hearing
whether you were in...

1005
01:25:14,284 --> 01:25:15,376
...or out.

1006
01:25:17,253 --> 01:25:19,778
In all this excitement,
I don't remember saying.

1007
01:25:23,526 --> 01:25:24,788
I need to know.

1008
01:25:26,062 --> 01:25:27,689
Time is of the essence.

1009
01:25:38,441 --> 01:25:41,376
Where have you been?
I've been on pins and needles.

1010
01:25:51,054 --> 01:25:52,954
I listened to the tape, Harry.

1011
01:25:54,290 --> 01:25:55,484
All of it.

1012
01:25:57,160 --> 01:25:59,594
It's not what you think.
It didn't mean anything.

1013
01:25:59,929 --> 01:26:01,362
It sounded sincere.

1014
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:05,497
Well, yeah. Nina, Nina...

1015
01:26:05,835 --> 01:26:07,769
Harry, I don't understand why.

1016
01:26:07,904 --> 01:26:10,065
I don't understand. Why did you do this?

1017
01:26:12,375 --> 01:26:13,842
I don't know. She-

1018
01:26:17,013 --> 01:26:18,173
She's a beautiful woman.

1019
01:26:18,248 --> 01:26:20,375
I'm not talking about Rhea Malroux.

1020
01:26:20,650 --> 01:26:24,643
Everything. I don't understand.
Don't tell me you did it for the money.

1021
01:26:25,488 --> 01:26:28,013
- I didn't do it for the money.
- Then why?

1022
01:26:30,693 --> 01:26:32,422
Well, I guess I felt like...

1023
01:26:33,429 --> 01:26:36,956
...somebody owed me something
for those two years. This is my way-

1024
01:26:39,035 --> 01:26:40,229
Well, well.

1025
01:26:41,337 --> 01:26:42,964
If it isn't the missing link.

1026
01:26:43,172 --> 01:26:45,697
I'm not surprised
you're mixed up in all this.

1027
01:26:45,775 --> 01:26:48,835
A snake can't change the fact
that it crawls on its belly for a living.

1028
01:26:48,912 --> 01:26:51,676
Sticks and stones, Barber.
Now, give me the tape.

1029
01:26:53,249 --> 01:26:54,273
Look.

1030
01:26:54,584 --> 01:26:56,484
You take the body, you get the tape.

1031
01:26:56,619 --> 01:27:00,385
I'm making the fucking deals around here.
Give me the tape.

1032
01:27:08,798 --> 01:27:10,265
Give me the other one.

1033
01:27:10,767 --> 01:27:11,961
What other one?

1034
01:27:12,035 --> 01:27:15,562
You met Odette alone.
If you taped Rhea, you taped the girl.

1035
01:27:18,174 --> 01:27:19,334
Well, Harry?

1036
01:27:20,510 --> 01:27:22,102
Did you tape the girl, too?

1037
01:27:47,470 --> 01:27:49,495
Now, about that problem of yours...

1038
01:27:54,610 --> 01:27:56,100
Here's the solution.

1039
01:27:56,245 --> 01:28:00,545
This stuff dissolves the flesh off bones,
then dissolves the bones...

1040
01:28:00,650 --> 01:28:02,311
...just like piss on a snowman.

1041
01:28:02,452 --> 01:28:06,013
All right, give me a hand.
You want to play, you must pay.

1042
01:28:07,256 --> 01:28:08,746
Oh, Jesus!

1043
01:28:11,461 --> 01:28:13,088
You got a bathtub?

1044
01:28:13,196 --> 01:28:14,891
- Yeah, why?
- Where's the bathtub?

1045
01:28:15,531 --> 01:28:17,692
- For her.
- You're gonna do this here?

1046
01:28:17,834 --> 01:28:20,598
- We're doing it here.
- No, you can't do it here!

1047
01:28:20,903 --> 01:28:22,336
You know, we'll use that.

1048
01:28:22,405 --> 01:28:24,532
- No. Take her out.
- It's happening.

1049
01:28:24,607 --> 01:28:27,269
- Not here!
- We'll do it. Shut up! Okay?

1050
01:28:27,410 --> 01:28:28,638
You shut up!

1051
01:28:29,412 --> 01:28:31,676
It's gonna take a couple of minutes.

1052
01:28:39,322 --> 01:28:42,291
Shit! Don't get it! Don't get it!

1053
01:28:43,826 --> 01:28:46,294
Don't answer it! Don't answer it!

1054
01:30:17,954 --> 01:30:19,683
Just keep the water running.

1055
01:30:19,822 --> 01:30:21,221
Your phone's ringing.

1056
01:30:21,524 --> 01:30:22,991
Want me to get that?

1057
01:30:24,160 --> 01:30:25,821
I almost forgot, Harry.

1058
01:30:29,932 --> 01:30:31,365
Guess you earned it.

1059
01:30:33,169 --> 01:30:34,158
Good-bye.

1060
01:30:43,813 --> 01:30:45,405
Counting your money, Harry?

1061
01:30:46,649 --> 01:30:48,981
I don't know how you can
even stand to touch it.

1062
01:31:08,871 --> 01:31:10,338
Fuck you!

1063
01:31:34,797 --> 01:31:37,288
Taking kind of a long lunch, aren't you?

1064
01:31:38,834 --> 01:31:39,823
Get in.

1065
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:52,907
Buckle your seat belt.

1066
01:31:56,919 --> 01:31:58,409
So what do you think?

1067
01:31:59,622 --> 01:32:00,646
About what?

1068
01:32:01,757 --> 01:32:03,691
Don't tell me you haven't heard?

1069
01:32:03,826 --> 01:32:05,088
They found her.

1070
01:32:06,596 --> 01:32:07,893
They found who?

1071
01:32:09,198 --> 01:32:10,460
Odette Malroux.

1072
01:32:11,834 --> 01:32:15,861
In a bungalow down at East Beach.
Right under our noses the whole time.

1073
01:32:27,416 --> 01:32:28,610
Let's go, Harry.

1074
01:32:29,752 --> 01:32:32,846
We're live at East Beach,
and this is Harry Barber...

1075
01:32:33,022 --> 01:32:36,583
Did you know that it was Malroux's
daughter? Did you know she was dead?

1076
01:32:36,826 --> 01:32:38,521
Did you know she was dead?

1077
01:32:38,594 --> 01:32:40,186
Are you involved in this?

1078
01:32:41,030 --> 01:32:43,521
Come on. Meadows is waiting on us.
Let's go.

1079
01:32:45,101 --> 01:32:46,864
Would you give us a statement?

1080
01:33:19,669 --> 01:33:20,761
It's seaweed.

1081
01:33:27,677 --> 01:33:30,840
Mr. Malroux, I hate to do this,
but it's very important.

1082
01:33:33,249 --> 01:33:34,682
Let's get on with it.

1083
01:33:42,558 --> 01:33:44,389
Is this your daughter, Odette?

1084
01:34:03,946 --> 01:34:05,072
Mr. Renick...

1085
01:34:05,348 --> 01:34:07,908
...this is Billy Holden.
He manages the place.

1086
01:34:08,751 --> 01:34:11,219
- Was it you that called this in?
- Yes, sir.

1087
01:34:11,354 --> 01:34:13,515
The maid found her a little while ago.

1088
01:34:14,190 --> 01:34:15,817
Was she renting the bungalow?

1089
01:34:15,925 --> 01:34:17,051
Ah, no, sir.

1090
01:34:18,094 --> 01:34:19,118
Who was?

1091
01:34:31,006 --> 01:34:32,132
Get him.

1092
01:34:42,251 --> 01:34:43,980
Harry, stop!

1093
01:35:43,546 --> 01:35:45,104
Oh, my God! My God!

1094
01:35:51,420 --> 01:35:54,514
- I'll get you a doctor.
- No, I'm all right. No, no doctors.

1095
01:35:56,025 --> 01:35:57,788
Don't think anything's broke.

1096
01:35:57,927 --> 01:36:01,090
You probably hurt that old truck
more than it hurt you.

1097
01:36:01,997 --> 01:36:04,397
That gunshot wound's another matter.

1098
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:07,401
It might be best
if you just gave yourself up.

1099
01:36:08,537 --> 01:36:12,064
I was hoping the rain would wash away
the whole dirty business.

1100
01:36:12,141 --> 01:36:13,574
And me right along with it.

1101
01:36:13,676 --> 01:36:14,973
Thank you.

1102
01:36:17,079 --> 01:36:21,914
I was in it right up to my ears, and
had no idea how the hell I'd get myself out.

1103
01:36:24,019 --> 01:36:26,180
There was only one thing I could do.

1104
01:37:24,513 --> 01:37:26,378
I've been waiting for you, Harry.

1105
01:37:31,086 --> 01:37:32,451
I'm sure you have.

1106
01:37:35,124 --> 01:37:36,386
I have a boat.

1107
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:39,455
We can go away together.

1108
01:37:40,629 --> 01:37:41,926
Just you and me.

1109
01:37:43,866 --> 01:37:45,458
Why don't I believe you?

1110
01:37:47,436 --> 01:37:49,461
Nobody was supposed to get killed.

1111
01:37:49,805 --> 01:37:51,773
Tell that to Odette Malroux.

1112
01:37:52,341 --> 01:37:53,638
It was Donnelly.

1113
01:37:54,476 --> 01:37:56,000
He's such an animal.

1114
01:37:57,780 --> 01:37:59,179
I'm so scared!

1115
01:38:01,116 --> 01:38:02,413
Will you hold me?

1116
01:38:03,652 --> 01:38:05,586
I need you so much.

1117
01:38:12,628 --> 01:38:14,027
Not this time.

1118
01:38:15,364 --> 01:38:18,265
Somebody's gotta pay the piper.
It's not gonna be me.

1119
01:38:19,602 --> 01:38:21,069
Where's your husband?

1120
01:38:21,503 --> 01:38:23,437
- Upstairs?
- You won't tell him.

1121
01:38:23,706 --> 01:38:26,698
- I think he deserves to know.
- No, he'll kill you.

1122
01:38:26,775 --> 01:38:29,608
- Better him than the state of Florida.
- What about us?

1123
01:38:29,778 --> 01:38:30,802
Us?

1124
01:38:31,246 --> 01:38:33,646
Where does somebody like you come from?

1125
01:38:33,816 --> 01:38:35,443
I'm just a girl with...

1126
01:38:35,584 --> 01:38:36,949
...a little ambition.

1127
01:38:37,119 --> 01:38:38,814
A little ambition?

1128
01:38:39,355 --> 01:38:40,788
We're no different!

1129
01:38:40,990 --> 01:38:43,151
You and me, Harry, we're the same.

1130
01:38:43,258 --> 01:38:44,953
That's where you're wrong.

1131
01:39:01,110 --> 01:39:02,304
Who are you?

1132
01:39:02,678 --> 01:39:04,145
My name's Harry Barber.

1133
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:06,406
Do I know you?

1134
01:39:07,449 --> 01:39:09,974
We have a mutual acquaintance
or two, yes.

1135
01:39:10,853 --> 01:39:12,252
What do you want?

1136
01:39:13,122 --> 01:39:15,556
My neck is in a noose
and I gotta get it out.

1137
01:39:16,325 --> 01:39:18,122
And you're my only chance.

1138
01:39:18,293 --> 01:39:21,126
Does this have something
to do with my daughter?

1139
01:39:21,263 --> 01:39:24,494
Unfortunately, sir, it's got everything
to do with your daughter.

1140
01:39:24,633 --> 01:39:26,294
Do you know who killed her?

1141
01:39:26,769 --> 01:39:27,793
Yes, I do.

1142
01:39:33,142 --> 01:39:34,336
I am waiting.

1143
01:39:37,246 --> 01:39:39,339
You got no reason to believe me...

1144
01:39:40,049 --> 01:39:41,914
...but I promise you it was-

1145
01:39:42,951 --> 01:39:44,748
Should I call the police, sir?

1146
01:39:48,824 --> 01:39:50,223
Continue, Mr. Barber.

1147
01:39:51,627 --> 01:39:53,492
Your wife and Donnelly.

1148
01:39:54,797 --> 01:39:56,094
He's lying, sir.

1149
01:39:56,165 --> 01:39:58,998
I know you got no reason to believe me,
but it's true.

1150
01:39:59,168 --> 01:40:02,695
They suckered me into
this phony kidnapping thing.

1151
01:40:02,938 --> 01:40:05,566
- And then they killed your daughter.
- He's lying, sir!

1152
01:40:05,641 --> 01:40:08,804
And they did it for money.
They're in on it together.

1153
01:40:08,911 --> 01:40:10,538
- I swear to God.
- Shut up!

1154
01:40:13,449 --> 01:40:14,473
Rhea?

1155
01:40:15,718 --> 01:40:17,276
Could you come in here?

1156
01:40:19,054 --> 01:40:20,214
Please!

1157
01:40:22,925 --> 01:40:25,621
I don't like doing this.
My wife is very upset.

1158
01:40:25,761 --> 01:40:27,422
It's an act, I'm telling you.

1159
01:40:27,529 --> 01:40:30,089
Your wife and this guy killed
your daughter.

1160
01:40:33,035 --> 01:40:34,229
Who is that?

1161
01:40:34,336 --> 01:40:35,860
That's not your wife.

1162
01:40:37,206 --> 01:40:38,798
That can't be your wife.

1163
01:40:39,007 --> 01:40:40,031
Shut up!

1164
01:40:41,810 --> 01:40:45,246
Although this is a death penalty state,
Mr. Barber...

1165
01:40:46,648 --> 01:40:50,448
...I won't live long enough to see you die
for the murder of my daughter.

1166
01:40:50,552 --> 01:40:52,179
I didn't kill your daughter.

1167
01:40:53,889 --> 01:40:55,550
Make sure he isn't found.

1168
01:40:55,824 --> 01:40:57,052
I didn't do it.

1169
01:40:57,326 --> 01:40:59,794
- Ever.
- I swear to God I didn't kill her.

1170
01:41:00,262 --> 01:41:02,355
Listen to me! I didn't do it.

1171
01:41:02,798 --> 01:41:04,129
I'm telling you-

1172
01:41:04,233 --> 01:41:05,291
Malroux, l-

1173
01:41:06,101 --> 01:41:08,069
I didn't kill your daughter.

1174
01:41:08,604 --> 01:41:09,764
Help me!

1175
01:41:59,454 --> 01:42:02,252
You had to get her involved,
didn't you, dumb fuck?

1176
01:42:06,295 --> 01:42:07,922
You know the wife, Harry.

1177
01:42:08,063 --> 01:42:09,087
To be.

1178
01:42:09,364 --> 01:42:10,524
Intimately.

1179
01:42:11,099 --> 01:42:13,590
She said you were lousy,
just like your writing.

1180
01:42:13,702 --> 01:42:16,728
I did not say lousy, I said predictable.

1181
01:42:17,039 --> 01:42:19,701
Like showing up tonight.
She figured you would.

1182
01:42:19,808 --> 01:42:21,571
It's not rocket science.

1183
01:42:21,677 --> 01:42:26,171
Guy coming out of prison on a bum charge
is gonna want to even the score a little.

1184
01:42:26,582 --> 01:42:28,072
It's only human nature.

1185
01:42:33,188 --> 01:42:35,418
The wife's good at human nature.

1186
01:42:35,958 --> 01:42:37,983
She's not bad at the physical stuff either.

1187
01:42:38,060 --> 01:42:40,688
But you couldn't keep your shirt on,
could you?

1188
01:42:40,796 --> 01:42:42,093
Or his pants.

1189
01:42:42,598 --> 01:42:44,930
Flash a little green under your nose,
a little pink...

1190
01:42:45,033 --> 01:42:47,558
...you panted like a big dog on a hot day.

1191
01:42:50,706 --> 01:42:55,302
I'm a sucker, me and that poor girl
you had playing like she's Odette Malroux.

1192
01:42:55,544 --> 01:42:56,909
She was very cute.

1193
01:42:59,214 --> 01:43:01,546
And a good little actress, wasn't she?

1194
01:43:02,284 --> 01:43:04,752
Some runaway from the Midwest.
Idaho, I think.

1195
01:43:04,887 --> 01:43:07,082
- That's the Northwest, hon.
- Who cares?

1196
01:43:07,689 --> 01:43:10,123
Nobody's gonna see her again anyway.

1197
01:43:18,567 --> 01:43:22,560
I can't believe you killed her and Odette
just for the ransom money.

1198
01:43:22,671 --> 01:43:25,834
Listen, Barber, a guy's so broke
his fucking cash bounces.

1199
01:43:26,441 --> 01:43:27,874
$500,000...

1200
01:43:28,577 --> 01:43:30,169
...is $500,000.

1201
01:43:30,646 --> 01:43:32,671
You always were small time, Donnelly.

1202
01:43:33,015 --> 01:43:35,313
Fuck you with a pile driver, Harry.

1203
01:43:35,584 --> 01:43:36,710
Hon?

1204
01:43:37,552 --> 01:43:39,383
Which one for the plane ride?

1205
01:43:39,655 --> 01:43:40,713
I feel...

1206
01:43:41,189 --> 01:43:43,157
...I don't know, dark and mysterious.

1207
01:43:44,459 --> 01:43:45,892
I don't know. Surprise me.

1208
01:43:48,931 --> 01:43:53,061
The little lady and I are going to Vegas
to get married, take some R and R.

1209
01:43:54,036 --> 01:43:55,663
Get the fuck off me.

1210
01:44:01,243 --> 01:44:03,074
Mr. Malroux gave us the week off...

1211
01:44:03,645 --> 01:44:05,579
...and his blessings, sweetheart.

1212
01:44:06,214 --> 01:44:09,012
- Mr. Malroux?
- That's how we met, Harry.

1213
01:44:09,418 --> 01:44:11,886
I do the cooking, cleaning and...

1214
01:44:12,587 --> 01:44:14,919
...take care of the old man.
- She does the gardening, too.

1215
01:44:14,990 --> 01:44:17,185
Rosemary, herbs, that sort of thing.

1216
01:44:17,292 --> 01:44:19,522
- I've always been a working girl.
- I'll bet.

1217
01:44:20,062 --> 01:44:21,029
I gotta hand it to you.

1218
01:44:21,096 --> 01:44:24,122
When you showed up that day,
I thought you blew the whole deal.

1219
01:44:24,266 --> 01:44:26,325
You got a fucking knack for that.

1220
01:44:26,601 --> 01:44:30,093
I had a damn good thing going
when I was a cop. Until you fucked it up.

1221
01:44:30,172 --> 01:44:34,040
- Couldn't just take the money, could you?
- Not Harry Barber. He's Mr. Clean.

1222
01:44:34,109 --> 01:44:35,974
You just don't learn, do you?

1223
01:44:36,178 --> 01:44:39,045
- Maybe next time-
- You're out of next times, Sunny Jim.

1224
01:44:39,147 --> 01:44:40,580
You understand me?

1225
01:44:41,950 --> 01:44:43,918
Well, I guess this is good-bye.

1226
01:44:45,320 --> 01:44:46,753
Can I have a moment?

1227
01:44:54,830 --> 01:44:56,593
This must be what you want.

1228
01:44:58,000 --> 01:44:59,433
I'm gonna miss you.

1229
01:45:10,779 --> 01:45:12,940
Okay, Lovebugs, that's...

1230
01:45:13,048 --> 01:45:14,106
...enough.

1231
01:45:17,753 --> 01:45:20,483
You don't really think
she's gonna marry you, do you?

1232
01:45:26,194 --> 01:45:28,628
- You talk too much.
- She won't marry you, I promise.

1233
01:45:28,697 --> 01:45:30,358
She'll fuck you over.

1234
01:45:43,612 --> 01:45:44,636
You know...

1235
01:45:45,347 --> 01:45:47,315
...the world's full of Harry Barbers.

1236
01:45:48,283 --> 01:45:51,446
Guys who want to play in the big leagues
but don't have the talent.

1237
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:54,819
My advice is: Don't go in the deep end
if you can't swim.

1238
01:46:08,303 --> 01:46:11,329
What're you doing, Harry?
You want to fucking play games?

1239
01:46:17,746 --> 01:46:19,475
Want to make this painful?

1240
01:46:23,952 --> 01:46:25,078
What's that?

1241
01:46:26,088 --> 01:46:28,283
Is that a wire? You wearing a wire?

1242
01:46:28,356 --> 01:46:29,687
Hold it, Donnelly!

1243
01:46:43,071 --> 01:46:44,265
Clear!

1244
01:46:44,840 --> 01:46:47,536
Check the back. Get her! Take care of her!

1245
01:46:52,347 --> 01:46:53,712
All right, I got you.

1246
01:47:01,957 --> 01:47:04,016
- Where have you been?
- Right outside.

1247
01:47:04,126 --> 01:47:05,457
That could've been me.

1248
01:47:05,560 --> 01:47:08,324
- It could've, but it isn't.
- That could've been me!

1249
01:47:08,396 --> 01:47:10,660
This had to look good to be believable.

1250
01:47:10,732 --> 01:47:12,666
You were late! That could've been me.

1251
01:47:12,734 --> 01:47:14,361
Jesus Christ! What?

1252
01:47:16,338 --> 01:47:17,327
Hi, baby.

1253
01:47:20,041 --> 01:47:21,406
I love you.

1254
01:47:25,780 --> 01:47:27,213
You did it, Barber.

1255
01:47:27,315 --> 01:47:28,339
Nice work.

1256
01:47:29,251 --> 01:47:30,309
Free at last.

1257
01:47:30,385 --> 01:47:32,751
- Read him his rights.
- What're you doing?

1258
01:47:33,955 --> 01:47:36,947
Conspiracy to kidnap,
accessory to extortion...

1259
01:47:37,025 --> 01:47:39,118
...hindering in investigation.
- This was my idea.

1260
01:47:39,194 --> 01:47:41,992
The whole wire thing. I got you re-elected!

1261
01:47:42,430 --> 01:47:43,658
Over here!

1262
01:47:46,868 --> 01:47:49,166
- Come out of there!
- Open the door!

1263
01:47:56,211 --> 01:47:58,509
Would you mind, please,
holding my bag for me?

1264
01:48:08,490 --> 01:48:09,514
Move it!

1265
01:48:12,661 --> 01:48:14,253
This isn't right, Renick.

1266
01:48:14,696 --> 01:48:16,357
I helped you out, you know.

1267
01:48:18,767 --> 01:48:22,533
- This isn't right. We had a deal.
- Let's go. Get her out of here.

1268
01:48:23,071 --> 01:48:25,471
Take them downtown.
Move it! Move it, come on!

1269
01:48:25,574 --> 01:48:27,474
- Let's go.
- This isn't right.

1270
01:49:03,979 --> 01:49:05,003
Well...

1271
01:49:05,580 --> 01:49:07,047
...I'm back in prison...

1272
01:49:07,415 --> 01:49:09,542
...back with my little friends.

1273
01:49:09,951 --> 01:49:12,249
It's part of the deal I cut with Renick.

1274
01:49:12,454 --> 01:49:14,479
But it isn't going to be for long.

1275
01:49:14,723 --> 01:49:18,124
The way I figure, just long enough
for me to write my story.

1276
01:49:23,331 --> 01:49:24,798
And then, who knows?

1277
01:49:28,536 --> 01:49:30,834
They might even turn it into a movie.
