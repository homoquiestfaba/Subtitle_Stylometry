- He's down with T.B.
- Oh, what a shame. Is it serious?

56
00:07:02,686 --> 00:07:06,816
No, they're just having breakfast.
T.B. Is Theodore Banner.

57
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:10,326
You know, the owner of Banner House,
the fellow publishing your little book?

58
00:07:10,394 --> 00:07:13,386
That's his portrait, there.

59
00:07:15,266 --> 00:07:18,394
[Vikki] Forgive me if we kept you
waiting, but Barbara hit a storm...

60
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:20,403
on her way down from Maine.

61
00:07:20,471 --> 00:07:23,372
- So you've come down from Maine, huh?
- You remember, C.B.

62
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,375
Miss Novak is
the farmer's daughter librarian...

63
00:07:26,443 --> 00:07:29,139
who spent the long,
cold New England winter...

64
00:07:29,213 --> 00:07:33,047
writing her manuscript
by the light of a lonely oil lamp.

65
00:07:33,117 --> 00:07:34,880
I'm at a loss here, ladies.

66
00:07:34,952 --> 00:07:38,979
I'm afraid I don't know exactly
what Miss Novak's book is about.

67
00:07:39,056 --> 00:07:43,288
Miss Novak's book is a serious work
of nonfiction entitled...

68
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,851
Vikki, excuse me.
It's right behind you.

69
00:07:45,929 --> 00:07:48,796
Would you mind pouring me
a cup of coffee?

70
00:07:50,434 --> 00:07:52,766
It's a serious work of nonfiction...

71
00:07:52,836 --> 00:07:55,202
entitled Down With Love.

72
00:07:55,272 --> 00:07:58,537
- This is empty.
- If you're making a fresh pot,
I'll have a cup.

73
00:07:58,609 --> 00:08:00,509
- Count me in.
- Likewise.

74
00:08:00,577 --> 00:08:02,101
- Ditto.
- None for me, Vikki.

75
00:08:02,179 --> 00:08:05,171
- Thanks, R.J.
- I'll have a Sanka.

76
00:08:08,752 --> 00:08:12,552
As I was saying, the central thesis
of Miss Novak's book, Down With Love...

77
00:08:12,623 --> 00:08:15,421
is that women will never be happy
until they become...

78
00:08:15,492 --> 00:08:20,054
independent as individuals by achieving
equal participation in the workforce.

79
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:23,896
And how do you propose
women do this, Miss Novak?

80
00:08:23,967 --> 00:08:27,300
By saying, "Down with love."

81
00:08:27,371 --> 00:08:29,532
Love is a distraction.

82
00:08:29,606 --> 00:08:32,632
If women were to stop falling in love,
it would mean the end of the human race.

83
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,735
Not at all.

84
00:08:34,812 --> 00:08:38,043
I said women should refrain
from love, C. W...

85
00:08:38,115 --> 00:08:40,049
not sex.

86
00:08:40,117 --> 00:08:43,143
Isn't that the same thing?

87
00:08:44,188 --> 00:08:46,782
I mean, for women.

88
00:08:46,857 --> 00:08:50,691
It won't be, after they've mastered the
three levels I've outlined in my book...

89
00:08:50,761 --> 00:08:53,889
that will teach any woman
to live life the way a man does.

90
00:08:53,964 --> 00:08:58,094
Level one instructs women
to abstain from men altogether...

91
00:08:58,168 --> 00:09:02,969
so they'll stop thinking that
the pleasures experienced during
the sex act are related to love.

92
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,668
They're not,
as women will learn...

93
00:09:05,743 --> 00:09:09,235
by practicing the self-pleasuring
technique that I've detailed...

94
00:09:09,313 --> 00:09:13,841
in chapter seven entitled...
"Up With Chocolate. '"

95
00:09:13,917 --> 00:09:16,181
- [Groaning]
- You see, gentlemen...

96
00:09:16,253 --> 00:09:19,654
the female experiences
a biological reaction to chocolate...

97
00:09:19,723 --> 00:09:23,921
that triggers the same
pleasurable responses as are
triggered during the sex act.

98
00:09:23,994 --> 00:09:26,929
By substituting chocolate for sex...

99
00:09:26,997 --> 00:09:30,797
the female will soon learn
the difference between sex and love.

100
00:09:30,868 --> 00:09:34,599
Love for a man will
no longer occupy her mind.

101
00:09:34,671 --> 00:09:38,004
She will now fiind that she has
the time and the energy...

102
00:09:38,075 --> 00:09:40,009
to move on to level two...

103
00:09:40,077 --> 00:09:43,740
where taking on new challenges will lead
to the self-sufficience of level three...

104
00:09:43,814 --> 00:09:46,339
where the woman becomes active
in the workplace...

105
00:09:46,417 --> 00:09:49,818
and earns and achieves
an unequivocal equality...

106
00:09:49,887 --> 00:09:51,821
with men.

107
00:09:55,826 --> 00:09:59,626
And all this time the woman
is abstaining from sex?

108
00:09:59,696 --> 00:10:01,630
Heavens no!

109
00:10:01,698 --> 00:10:05,259
By level three, she can have sex
whenever she likes, without love...

110
00:10:05,335 --> 00:10:09,169
and enjoy it the way a man does...
a la carte.

111
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:17,041
Well, Miss Novak, your theories...

112
00:10:17,114 --> 00:10:19,844
may have worked with
the gentlemen up in Maine...

113
00:10:19,917 --> 00:10:24,877
but the men in Manhattan are not the fiine,
upstanding, straightforward men of Maine.

114
00:10:24,955 --> 00:10:27,856
The men of Manhattan are devious.

115
00:10:27,925 --> 00:10:31,224
They're dangerous. They'll be
coming at you from every angle.

116
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:34,196
While you're watching your front,
they'll attack from the rear.!

117
00:10:34,264 --> 00:10:38,598
And while you're protecting your rear,
they'll drop out of the sky.

118
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,171
Adios.

119
00:10:45,542 --> 00:10:49,103
Oh, one more kiss.!

120
00:10:52,616 --> 00:10:55,551
[English Accent] Easy, baby.
Be careful you don't fall out.

They're always new.
When he gets in, tell him to see me.

132
00:11:39,862 --> 00:11:41,591

Oh, yes, you are!

136
00:11:48,904 --> 00:11:52,237
So you can take your Pulitzer
and your beloved Underwood
and your change of underwear...

137
00:11:52,307 --> 00:11:54,241
and clear out.

138
00:11:54,309 --> 00:11:56,607
Do you work for me?

139
00:11:58,881 --> 00:12:02,146
You had a story due yesterday,
but I gave you more time.

140
00:12:02,217 --> 00:12:06,916
I held the presses so you could get
your scoop on Nazis hiding in Argentina.

141
00:12:06,989 --> 00:12:10,186
Then I see this.!

What do you got for me, Catch?
What do you got?

152
00:12:41,657 --> 00:12:45,320
Argentina isn't the only hiding place for
Nazis. They're hiding them in Florida too.

153
00:12:45,394 --> 00:12:47,794
Wow! How?
Who's hiding them?

154
00:12:47,863 --> 00:12:50,423
- We are.
- We Americans?

Why? Nazis are bad.
We're good.

Yeah, but some bad Nazis
are good scientists.

00:13:35,711 --> 00:13:37,702
Whoa! Catch!

171
00:13:37,779 --> 00:13:40,543
But is it safe to print?
NASA's gonna blow its stack.

172
00:13:40,616 --> 00:13:44,814
Well, they forgave Germany.
They can forgive us.

173
00:13:44,887 --> 00:13:48,379
Get someone from Legal up here.

174
00:13:48,457 --> 00:13:50,516
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

175
00:13:50,592 --> 00:13:53,026
Yes, sir. Yes, sir!

176
00:13:53,095 --> 00:13:56,861
My analyst says I only react to you
with such vehement loathing...

177
00:13:56,932 --> 00:13:58,923
because I admire you so much.

178
00:13:59,001 --> 00:14:01,993
He says I resent you
for being a self-made man...

179
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,561
as opposed to the son
of a self-made man.

180
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:08,371
Here. Hope you have your garters
from last night. There's none in here.

181
00:14:08,443 --> 00:14:12,675
Garters? I haven't worn garters
since Nixon conceded.

182
00:14:12,748 --> 00:14:15,308
What, are you turning into
some sort of beatnik?

183
00:14:15,384 --> 00:14:18,547
Step into the future.
Garters are a thing of the past.

184
00:14:20,489 --> 00:14:23,253
I don't know, Catch.

185
00:14:23,325 --> 00:14:25,759
I have enough
of an insecurity complex...

186
00:14:25,827 --> 00:14:29,126
without worrying about
my socks falling down.

187
00:14:29,197 --> 00:14:33,759
How can you be confident you won't show
a shiny shin when you cross your legs?

188
00:14:33,835 --> 00:14:35,996
It's a miracle of the space age.

189
00:14:36,071 --> 00:14:41,008
Silk manufacturers are using new wonder
fibers like Lycra, Orlon and Dacron...

190
00:14:41,076 --> 00:14:44,136
to put super stay-up power
into their over-the-calf sock.

191
00:14:44,212 --> 00:14:47,704
[Peter] What would you say is
the average length for most men?

192
00:14:47,783 --> 00:14:49,717
[Catcher]
How would I know?

193
00:14:49,785 --> 00:14:53,448
You think I spend all my time
in the locker room at the club
making a comparative study?

194
00:14:53,522 --> 00:14:55,581
[Peter]
Let me see yours again, then.

195
00:14:55,657 --> 00:14:57,591
We could measure.
I'll get a ruler.

196
00:14:57,659 --> 00:15:00,423
- [Catcher] Better make it a yardstick.
- [Gasps]

197
00:15:00,495 --> 00:15:04,090
Let's be accurate. Make sure
you've got it fully extended.

198
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:06,100
Have it up the whole way.

199
00:15:06,168 --> 00:15:09,137
[Catcher] It stays up all the way
all day long, man.

200
00:15:09,204 --> 00:15:12,833
That's the miracle I was telling you about.
Better living through chemistry.

201
00:15:12,908 --> 00:15:15,240
You got 16 inches.

202
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:17,471
[Peter]
Sixteen inches?

203
00:15:17,546 --> 00:15:19,707
How long does a man's hose
have to be?

204
00:15:19,781 --> 00:15:22,716
[Catcher] That's 32 inches
of confidence in every step.

205
00:15:22,784 --> 00:15:26,015
Don't forget...
I've got two of'em.

206
00:15:30,292 --> 00:15:34,126
I don't believe it. You went through
another one. That's three this month.

207
00:15:34,196 --> 00:15:37,432
What is it about the workplace
that women just can't seem to handle?

208
00:15:37,432 --> 00:15:38,228
What is it about the workplace
that women just can't seem to handle?

209
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,030
Men! They want us to fail.

210
00:15:41,103 --> 00:15:43,936
The nerve, inviting me to New York
to launch my book...

211
00:15:44,006 --> 00:15:46,304
when they have no intention
of promoting it!

212
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,536
- Don't worry. I have a plan.
- You do?

213
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:52,569
Remember last winter you said you'd like
publicity where men would see it too?

214
00:15:52,648 --> 00:15:54,741
"Perhaps in a men's magazine,"
you said.

215
00:15:54,816 --> 00:15:56,807
"A prestigious men's magazine.

216
00:15:56,885 --> 00:16:00,150
The most widely circulated and
highly respected men's magazine."

217
00:16:00,222 --> 00:16:02,156
- KNOW?
- Yes, you did.

218
00:16:02,224 --> 00:16:05,318
No, I mean KNOW. KNOW magazine,
for men in the know.

219
00:16:05,394 --> 00:16:07,362
Oh, yes. Exactly.

220
00:16:07,429 --> 00:16:11,092
- You got us advertising in KNOW?
- I did better.

221
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:15,933
I got you a cover story written by KNOW
magazine's star journalist Catcher Block.

222
00:16:16,004 --> 00:16:19,496
Catcher Block? The ladies' man,
man's man, man about town?

223
00:16:19,574 --> 00:16:22,372
Oh, Vikki,
you're the best friend...

224
00:16:22,444 --> 00:16:25,880
a girl from Maine who wrote a book
and came to New York could ever have!

225
00:16:25,947 --> 00:16:27,938
You don't know the half of it.

226
00:16:28,016 --> 00:16:31,577
I hear Catcher Block
is gorgeous... and eligible.

227
00:16:32,788 --> 00:16:34,949
Not that that matters to us.

228
00:16:35,023 --> 00:16:36,957
Down with love!

229
00:16:37,025 --> 00:16:41,758
I can't believe it.
Me on the cover of KNOW. KNOW.!

230
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:45,493
- No.
- Catch, please, I promised.
It's one cover story.

231
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:49,230
A girl's never called me in my life,
let alone invited me for a drink.

232
00:16:49,304 --> 00:16:51,295
I think this Vikki really likes me.

233
00:16:51,373 --> 00:16:53,307
I think I might really like her.

234
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:57,175
I'm sure I would if she
really likes me, and she does
because I led her to believe...

235
00:16:57,245 --> 00:16:59,975
that as the owner of KNOW magazine,
I had some pull with my staff.

236
00:17:00,048 --> 00:17:02,881
Then pull your staff with one of
your other writers. I'm not doing it.

237
00:17:02,951 --> 00:17:04,885
No, it can't be anyone else.

238
00:17:04,953 --> 00:17:09,253
The best thing I have to offer
a woman is the same as the best
thing you have to offer... you.

239
00:17:09,324 --> 00:17:12,384
But I'm all tied up, Mac.
I'm using me.

240
00:17:12,461 --> 00:17:14,952
Oh, come on! It'll be fun.

241
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:17,294
- You like fun.
- Fun?

242
00:17:17,365 --> 00:17:21,096
Interviewing a man-hating embittered
New England spinster librarian?

243
00:17:21,169 --> 00:17:22,761
How do you know what she's like?

244
00:17:22,838 --> 00:17:25,466
Who else would write a book
called Down With Love?

245
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:29,601
You don't have to be a Nazi
rocket scientist to figure that out.

246
00:17:29,678 --> 00:17:33,478
Catch, please, please, please, please?

247
00:17:33,582 --> 00:17:36,710
I hope you won't be disappointed.

[Phone Ringing]

251
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:15,519
My first New York phone call!

252
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:19,492
It must be KNOW magazine.
No one else has your number.

253
00:18:20,695 --> 00:18:22,754
It must be Catcher Block!

254
00:18:22,831 --> 00:18:24,822
- Oh!
- Oh!

255
00:18:26,835 --> 00:18:29,827
- This is Barbara Novak.
- This is Catcher Block.

256

257
00:18:33,642 --> 00:18:36,611
- KNOW magazine.
- Oh, yes, of course.

258
00:18:36,678 --> 00:18:39,511
What can I do for you,
Mr. Block?

259
00:18:39,581 --> 00:18:42,072
I think it's what I can do for you,
Miss Novak.

260
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:44,880
I'd like to invite you to lunch
so we can discuss your book.

261
00:18:44,953 --> 00:18:46,944
That sounds very nice...

262
00:18:47,022 --> 00:18:50,082
but I'll have to check my schedule
to see when I'm available.

263
00:18:50,158 --> 00:18:53,559
We've already ordered. Can you be in
the Mahogany Room in ten minutes?

264
00:18:53,628 --> 00:18:56,222
I'm afraid that will be
impossible, Mr. Block.

265
00:18:56,298 --> 00:18:58,858
- Some other time, then.
- Right.

266
00:18:58,934 --> 00:19:01,732
I'll see you in 15.

00:19:03,938 --> 00:19:08,432
Catch, you are the best friend a guy
with 20 diagnosed neuroses ever had.

269
00:19:08,509 --> 00:19:11,501
We've been friends a long time.
I knew you when you only had 12.

270
00:19:11,579 --> 00:19:13,740
This is great!
I'll be right back.

271

Gotta go put in my shoe lifts.

272
00:19:20,421 --> 00:19:23,254
- Guess who.
- As if I'd need to guess.

273
00:19:23,324 --> 00:19:25,815
- Hmm. Tell me my name.
- Tell me you love me.

274
00:19:25,893 --> 00:19:27,884
Blimey, Catch.
You know I love you.

- How long's your layover?
- Never long enough.

Nice to meet you,
Mr. MacMannus.

00:20:41,836 --> 00:20:45,294
- [Vikki] Where's Mr. Block?
- Yes, where's Mr. Block?

282

I, uh, I don't know. Henri.

00:20:48,943 --> 00:20:51,673
- Where is Mr. Block?
- I don't know.

A Mr. Block for you,
Mr. MacMannus?

285
00:20:54,715 --> 00:20:56,683
Ah.

286
00:20:56,751 --> 00:20:58,685
Here he is now.

287
00:21:02,123 --> 00:21:04,114
- Catcher!
- Mac.

288
00:21:04,191 --> 00:21:07,991
- Where are ya?
- Something sprang up. Is she there?

289
00:21:08,062 --> 00:21:11,463
- Yes, she is.
- Let me speak to the spinster.

290
00:21:11,532 --> 00:21:14,695
Mr. Block would like
to speak with you.

291
00:21:18,673 --> 00:21:21,540
- This is Barbara Novak.
- I'm so sorry, Miss Novak.

292
00:21:21,609 --> 00:21:23,543
The darndest thing.

293
00:21:23,611 --> 00:21:26,774
I was waiting for you at the bar,
and a little English foxhound...

294
00:21:26,847 --> 00:21:30,146
walked right in, came up to me
and started nuzzling me.

295
00:21:30,217 --> 00:21:33,209
She seemed so lost, and she didn't
want to go with anyone else...

296
00:21:33,287 --> 00:21:35,448
so I just had to take care of her.

297
00:21:35,523 --> 00:21:38,287
Mr. Block, that is so thoughtful.

298
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:41,419
I remember reading that the true test
of a man's character...

299
00:21:41,495 --> 00:21:43,986
is how he treats
a defenseless creature.

300
00:21:44,065 --> 00:21:47,694
Tell me, Mr. Block,
how is the little bitch now?

301
00:21:47,768 --> 00:21:50,464
Well, I've got her
all nestled in a box...

302
00:21:50,538 --> 00:21:54,133
but I don't think she'll be content
until I'm holding her.

303
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:57,006
Miss Novak, could we
rain check until dinner?

304
00:21:57,078 --> 00:21:59,137
Of course.

I'm out in the park
with my little French poodle...

312

if you know what I mean.

from a farm girl to a city boy.

a little twig in her bottom...

316

she'll remember why she went out
with you in the first place.

317

I'll keep that in mind.

00:23:33,541 --> 00:23:36,374
Oh, I took in a night game...
with Catcher Block.

334
00:23:40,014 --> 00:23:43,472
- I told him I'd give up flying for him.
- I did too.!

335
00:23:43,551 --> 00:23:46,850
- Now I wonder if he ever loved me.
- I wonder if he even cared.

336
00:23:49,123 --> 00:23:51,148
[Both]
I wonder what's keeping Elkie!

337
00:24:01,602 --> 00:24:03,536
This is Barbara Novak.

338
00:24:03,604 --> 00:24:06,767
I'm so sorry, Miss Novak.
The darndest thing.

339
00:24:06,841 --> 00:24:10,971
I got waylaid by the sweetest Swedish lap
hound, who kept me up half the night...

340
00:24:11,045 --> 00:24:13,673
and I'm afraid I'm still in bed.

341
00:24:13,747 --> 00:24:16,739
My! You do get waylaid.

342
00:24:16,817 --> 00:24:19,980
- Would you care for another beverage?
- Yeah, sure. Thank you.

343
00:24:20,054 --> 00:24:24,252
- I beg your pardon?
- I was saying thank you.
You're very understanding.

344
00:24:24,325 --> 00:24:26,725
Could we rain check until lunch?

345
00:24:26,794 --> 00:24:28,955
Oh, Mr. Block.

346
00:24:29,029 --> 00:24:31,190
You can take your rain check...

347
00:24:31,265 --> 00:24:34,098
and as we say on the farm
at harvest time...

348
00:24:34,168 --> 00:24:37,103
put it where the sun
does not shine!

349
00:24:37,171 --> 00:24:40,663
Miss Novak, if you're looking
to get dinner, then just say so.

350
00:24:40,741 --> 00:24:44,541
[Scoffing Laugh]
Mr. Block...

351
00:24:44,612 --> 00:24:46,773
I wouldn't meet with you...

352
00:24:46,847 --> 00:24:50,010
in a hundred years!

353
00:24:50,084 --> 00:24:52,279
- Good-bye, Mr. Block...
- [Punching Sound]

354
00:24:52,353 --> 00:24:54,844
Forever!

[Thunder Rumbling]

356
00:25:00,261 --> 00:25:02,889
Mr. MacMannus,
thank you for your trouble.

357
00:25:02,963 --> 00:25:05,227
Not at all.

358
00:25:05,299 --> 00:25:08,393
Vikki, I'll call a taxi.

359
00:25:12,373 --> 00:25:15,342
- Guess this means we're through.
- Oh, it's sad, isn't it?

360
00:25:15,409 --> 00:25:18,401
This is the first time I've had to
eliminate having a future with a man...

361
00:25:18,479 --> 00:25:21,380
before we've even had a chance
to have had a past.

362
00:25:21,448 --> 00:25:23,541
Good-bye, Mr. MacMannus.

363
00:25:30,724 --> 00:25:34,285
- [Band]
- [Peter] It was nice while it lasted.

364
00:25:34,361 --> 00:25:38,559
I haven't had dinner and breakfast
with the same woman since I had a nanny.

365
00:25:38,632 --> 00:25:41,624
I'm sorry, Peter, but Vikki
is not the only girl for you.

366
00:25:41,702 --> 00:25:43,693
That's why I brought you here.

367
00:25:43,771 --> 00:25:46,672
You brought me here...
because we're buddies, right?

368
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,674
Bosom buddies.

369
00:25:48,742 --> 00:25:52,405
- [Men Whistling]
- [Continues]

370
00:26:02,957 --> 00:26:05,050
Get a load of those rockets.

371
00:26:05,125 --> 00:26:08,891
- Here's to antigravity.
- Stay with me, buddy.
You'll get the spins.

372
00:26:08,963 --> 00:26:11,796
And whatever you do,
don't close your eyes.

373
00:26:11,865 --> 00:26:14,629
Don't close your eyes.

374
00:26:14,902 --> 00:26:18,360
Open your eyes. Open your eyes.

375
00:26:20,608 --> 00:26:23,008
Ta-da! It's your book.

376
00:26:23,077 --> 00:26:26,376
On sale, Scribners, Fifth Avenue.

377
00:26:26,447 --> 00:26:28,438
One?

378
00:26:29,617 --> 00:26:31,608
Just one?

379
00:26:32,753 --> 00:26:36,314
All that work,
and-and-and-and one?

380
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:40,486
If somebody buys it,
well, then there will be none.

381
00:26:40,561 --> 00:26:43,655
It will be as if
it never even existed.

382
00:26:43,731 --> 00:26:47,223
No, no.
Doubleday also has one.

383
00:26:47,301 --> 00:26:49,735
- [Bell Dings]
- Mmm.

384
00:26:49,803 --> 00:26:53,136
I know you're thinking this is
a real setback, but I promise you...

385
00:26:53,207 --> 00:26:55,198
I will think of something.

386
00:26:57,444 --> 00:26:59,812
If only we could get your book
on The Ed Sullivan Show.

387
00:26:59,812 --> 00:27:01,712
If only we could get your book
on The Ed Sullivan Show.

388
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:04,044
Yeah.

389
00:27:04,116 --> 00:27:07,950
How exactly do you get a book
on The Ed Sullivan Show?

390
00:27:09,354 --> 00:27:11,982
[Barbara]
Vikki, you're incredible.

391
00:27:12,057 --> 00:27:15,117
She wasn't even on the bill.
How did they fit her into the lineup?

392
00:27:15,194 --> 00:27:17,128
- [Audience Applauding]
- Oh, the best luck.

393

The Singing Nun fell off her scooter
coming across the Triborough Bridge.

394
00:27:20,499 --> 00:27:22,399
I guess somebody up there likes me.

395
00:27:22,467 --> 00:27:25,800
[Ed Sullivan]
We have for you a really big surprise...

396
00:27:25,871 --> 00:27:29,363
because to coincide
with the arrival of the new book...

397
00:27:29,441 --> 00:27:31,841
Down With Love...

398
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:35,573
which this week is at your booksellers
from coast to coast...

399
00:27:35,647 --> 00:27:39,481
we have a very, very special
friend of our show...

400
00:27:39,551 --> 00:27:41,951
to do a song of that book.

401
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:45,148
Now, I want a really big,
warm welcome...

402
00:27:45,224 --> 00:27:47,385
forJudy Garland...

403
00:27:47,459 --> 00:27:49,393
right on this stage.

[Band]

405
00:28:35,207 --> 00:28:37,801
Yes, ma'am. Down With Love
by Barbara Novak.

406
00:28:37,876 --> 00:28:40,470
It's called Down With Love
by Barbara Novak.

407
00:29:00,165 --> 00:29:02,929

- Yes!

413
00:30:39,531 --> 00:30:41,522
You said she was a spinster.

414
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,262
I've never used
the word "spinster" in my life.

415
00:30:44,336 --> 00:30:47,965
Okay, once, when I told my mother
it was technically incorrect
to call her son a spinster.

416
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,508
- You said she was a brunette.
- I did not!

417
00:30:50,575 --> 00:30:53,100
She sure didn't sound like a blond
on the telephone.

418
00:30:53,178 --> 00:30:56,670
- You still want to date Vikki?
- Of course. You think I
want to die a spinster?

419
00:30:56,748 --> 00:31:00,650
- Tell her I'll do the cover story.
- You are the best friend...

420
00:31:00,719 --> 00:31:03,813
Just... call.

[Man] Not sinceJohannes Gutenberg's
invention of the printing press...

and achieved so much...

424
00:31:16,468 --> 00:31:18,868
reminding all of us here today...

425
00:31:18,937 --> 00:31:23,067
of the noble goal which called us
to toil in the field of publishing...

426
00:31:23,141 --> 00:31:25,405
to begin with...

427
00:31:25,477 --> 00:31:27,411
sales.

428
00:31:27,479 --> 00:31:31,609
So here's to Banner House's
new number-one author...

429
00:31:31,683 --> 00:31:35,346
and our new number-one editor.

430

You look wonderful.

Tell him we're too busy.

442
00:32:09,788 --> 00:32:14,054
- What do you mean? "Too busy"?
- You know what it means.

443
00:32:14,126 --> 00:32:16,356
[Peter]
They hate us.

444
00:32:16,428 --> 00:32:18,419
Too busy?

445
00:32:18,497 --> 00:32:21,933
Kennedy, Khrushchev and Castro weren't
too busy during the Cuban Missile Crisis...

446
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,934
to sit down and talk to me...

447
00:32:24,002 --> 00:32:27,028
but this Down With Love chick
is too busy.

448
00:32:27,105 --> 00:32:29,801

[Man On TV]
I'm sorry, panel. You've been stumped.

450
00:32:32,711 --> 00:32:36,169
- The author of the best seller,
Down With Love...
- It's Novak!

451
00:32:36,248 --> 00:32:38,773
- Barbara Novak.
- [Audience Applauding]

452
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:41,410
Barbara, I know every woman
bought your book...

453
00:32:41,486 --> 00:32:45,718
and every man sneaked out and bought it
to find out what their women were reading.

454
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:47,917
- That's when the sales doubled.
- [Laughing]

455
00:32:47,993 --> 00:32:50,427
[Man] But then they tripled.
How did that happen?

456
00:32:50,495 --> 00:32:54,397
It seems that church groups
in the Bible belt were so zealous...

457
00:32:54,466 --> 00:32:57,560
about being seen burning my book...

458
00:32:57,636 --> 00:33:00,628
that every time they had a bonfire,
they would call and reorder...

459
00:33:00,705 --> 00:33:03,538
so that they could have another one.

460
00:33:06,545 --> 00:33:09,275
Now, I've heard a lot of talk
about chapter eight...

461
00:33:09,347 --> 00:33:12,316
about the worst kind of man,
the kind every woman should avoid.

462
00:33:12,384 --> 00:33:13,874
What's that title again?

463
00:33:13,952 --> 00:33:18,412
"Men who change women as often
as they change their shirts."

464
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:21,926
[Man] And have you met a lot
of that kind of man in your research?

465
00:33:21,993 --> 00:33:25,554
[Chuckles] You're not asking me
to name names, are you?

466
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:28,463
- No, of course not.

Wow!

Four million women
in the naked city...

and the one you let get away, the one
you had to get on the bad side of...

472
00:33:48,987 --> 00:33:53,754
is the woman all the other
four million are listening to.

You blew it, buddy.

The age of Catcher Block, ladies' man,
man's man, man about town...

is over!

I hate to spoil your fun, but
the four million women I go out with...

479
00:34:10,308 --> 00:34:12,606
don't listen to Barbara Novak.

Hey, Gwendolyn, baby.
Where are you?

483
00:34:22,687 --> 00:34:26,020
Then get out of the airport.
We have reservations for 10:00.

484
00:34:26,091 --> 00:34:29,527
Well, you can't sit
in the terminal till 3:00 a.m.

00:34:29,594 --> 00:34:31,528
Aren't you going to get hungry?

No, I'm pretty full.

00:34:33,598 --> 00:34:36,795

catch up on some reading.

Good night, Gwendolyn.

00:34:50,849 --> 00:34:55,251
What's the matter, Catch?
Lose another one?

491
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:58,751
I am going to bury that Novak broad...

492
00:34:58,821 --> 00:35:02,814
and turn this crazy upside Down

I'm gonna write
the expose of the century...

so the world will know once and for all
that deep down all women are the same.

And I am going to prove it.

How?

00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:51,423
- This is your big emergency?
- Yes!

668
00:46:51,497 --> 00:46:53,488
I invited Vikki to dinner.

669
00:46:53,566 --> 00:46:57,434
It has to be perfect so she'll find me
irresistible and I can make my big move.

670
00:46:57,503 --> 00:47:00,666
You could have made your big move
three weeks ago. I keep telling you.

671
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:03,903
That's these Down With Love
girls' claim to fame...

672
00:47:03,976 --> 00:47:05,910
one date, no waiting.

673
00:47:05,978 --> 00:47:10,108
These Down With Love girls
may be used to having sex
the way a man does, but I'm not.

674
00:47:10,182 --> 00:47:12,116
Too sweet?

675
00:47:14,253 --> 00:47:18,587
So I guess you and Novak
have been very "down with love."

676
00:47:18,657 --> 00:47:22,855
I mean, you've had what...
29 dates in 23 days?

677
00:47:22,928 --> 00:47:25,920
Yeah, but I'm trying to get her
not to want to have sex with me.

678
00:47:25,998 --> 00:47:28,865
These days you've really got to play
your cards right to get a girl to say no.

679
00:47:28,934 --> 00:47:31,562
Or maybe you just like
spending time with her.

680
00:47:31,637 --> 00:47:35,733
Maybe the necessity
of all this chastity and monogamy...

681
00:47:35,808 --> 00:47:39,574
has made you realize that Barbara Novak
is your ideal potential lover.

682
00:47:39,645 --> 00:47:42,614
Come back to Earth, buddy boy.
Your cake's burning.

683
00:47:42,681 --> 00:47:45,548
- [Alarm Buzzing]
- [Gasps]

684
00:47:49,288 --> 00:47:52,280
So this is how a guy like you
does it, huh?

685
00:47:52,358 --> 00:47:55,293
No, I don't do it, but if I did do it,
I'd do what I'm doing.

686
00:47:55,361 --> 00:47:57,329
Which reminds me
of something I didn't do.

687
00:47:57,396 --> 00:48:01,093
- I have to call Vikki
and give her my address.
- I've got a better idea.

688
00:48:01,167 --> 00:48:05,763
Invite Vikki to my place,
make like it's yours. You know
where I keep the spare key.

689
00:48:05,838 --> 00:48:08,807
You'd let me use the key
you leave out for your girlfriends?

690
00:48:08,874 --> 00:48:10,808
Somebody might as well.

691
00:48:10,876 --> 00:48:13,868
It's gathering dust
since Novak hit the best-seller list.

692
00:48:13,946 --> 00:48:17,438
- But I invited Vikki
for a home-cooked meal.
- Trust me.

693
00:48:17,516 --> 00:48:22,010
Ten minutes in my apartment,
and you'll both forget all about dinner.

694
00:48:23,189 --> 00:48:25,214
Ten minutes?

695
00:48:25,291 --> 00:48:27,987
Ten minutes.

696
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:30,824
[Phone Rings]

697
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:36,261
[Rings]

698
00:48:39,371 --> 00:48:42,807
[Rings]

699
00:48:42,875 --> 00:48:45,571
- Hello.
- Hello, Barbara. It's Zip.

700
00:48:45,644 --> 00:48:47,578
Hello, Zip.

701
00:48:47,646 --> 00:48:51,582
I was wondering if I could ask you
to do me a very special favor.

702
00:48:51,650 --> 00:48:53,777
Sure, Zip. Anything.

703
00:48:53,853 --> 00:48:56,822
Well, I know we planned
to go out, but...

704
00:48:56,889 --> 00:48:59,380
- well, I thought it might
be fun to stay in.
- [Exhaling]

705
00:48:59,458 --> 00:49:02,621
I'm in the mood
for a home-cooked meal.

706
00:49:02,695 --> 00:49:06,961
Major Martin, I have no desire
to stay cooped up in the kitchen...

707
00:49:07,032 --> 00:49:10,991
slaving over a hot stove
and a sink full of dirty dishes.

708
00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:14,972
Oh, no, Barbara.
You misunderstood.

709
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,634
When I said
a home-cooked meal...

710
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:22,170
I meant at my place...
I wanted to serve you.

711
00:49:22,248 --> 00:49:25,217
Oh, Zip.

712
00:49:25,284 --> 00:49:28,014
No man has ever
done this for me before.

713
00:49:28,087 --> 00:49:30,578
How thoughtful.

714
00:49:30,656 --> 00:49:33,489
- Well.
- And considerate.

715
00:49:33,559 --> 00:49:35,493
It's my pleasure.

716
00:49:35,561 --> 00:49:39,463
Oh, no, no, no. It's mine.

717
00:49:39,532 --> 00:49:43,161
- So, you'd like to come?
- Oh, yes.

718
00:49:43,235 --> 00:49:46,363
Yes. Yes.

719
00:49:46,438 --> 00:49:48,998
I can't wait.

720
00:49:49,074 --> 00:49:51,065
[Sighs]

721
00:49:53,479 --> 00:49:55,970
Seventy-third and Park.
And Barbara?

722
00:49:56,048 --> 00:50:00,712
- Yes, Zip?
- Thank you for being so flexible.

723
00:50:00,786 --> 00:50:03,550
No, Zip. Thank you.

724
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:24,404
Oh, Zip!

725
00:50:24,476 --> 00:50:27,468
Everything looks divine.

726
00:50:29,181 --> 00:50:31,672
I have a funny feeling
that you've done...

727
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:34,583
quite a bit of entertaining
for two here.

728
00:50:34,653 --> 00:50:37,622
Oh, I can honestly say
that until you...

729
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:41,421
I haven't done any entertaining
for two here at all.

730
00:50:41,493 --> 00:50:43,984
You're certainly not
the average astronaut.

731
00:50:44,063 --> 00:50:48,124
Oh, I get so tired
of all that freeze-dried food.

732
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,862
After a steady diet of pellet steak...

733
00:50:50,936 --> 00:50:52,870
and potato tablets...

734
00:50:52,938 --> 00:50:56,931
you yearn for something hot
to sink your teeth into.

735
00:51:01,146 --> 00:51:04,138
Well, you've whetted my appetite.

736
00:51:05,551 --> 00:51:08,213
It's not just your cooking.

737
00:51:10,222 --> 00:51:12,850
You are so well-rounded.

738
00:51:14,059 --> 00:51:18,291
Your collection of art
and antiques.

739
00:51:18,364 --> 00:51:20,832
You've made a real home here.

740
00:51:20,899 --> 00:51:24,494
Well, Earth still is
my favorite planet.

741
00:51:24,570 --> 00:51:27,437
No, I meant here, in New York.

742
00:51:27,506 --> 00:51:29,440
Oh.

743
00:51:29,508 --> 00:51:32,807
Most bachelors in this city are
only interested in an apartment...

744
00:51:32,878 --> 00:51:35,870
that comes fully loaded
with every gadget and contraption...

745
00:51:35,948 --> 00:51:39,616
man has invented
to snare a woman.

746
00:51:41,818 --> 00:51:46,084
I don't understand this, Peter.
How does a person lose their built-in bar?

747
00:51:46,155 --> 00:51:50,421
[Chuckles]
I swear, it was here a minute ago.

748
00:51:52,261 --> 00:51:55,389
- [Mechanical Whirring]
- Ohh!

749
00:51:55,465 --> 00:51:58,434
[Gasps]

750
00:52:02,538 --> 00:52:05,098
[Whirring]

751
00:52:05,174 --> 00:52:09,008
Hey. Found it. Vikki?

752
00:52:09,078 --> 00:52:12,275
Where are you?

753
00:52:12,348 --> 00:52:16,910
- [Vikki] I don't know.
- [Shrieks]

754
00:52:18,321 --> 00:52:20,881
Oh.

755
00:52:23,459 --> 00:52:27,759
Peter, your couch was all over me
like some animal.

756
00:52:27,830 --> 00:52:31,766
- Who knew you were so dangerous?
- I'm sorry.

757
00:52:31,834 --> 00:52:35,031
Uh, I know I seem
a little disoriented.

758
00:52:35,104 --> 00:52:38,130
Guess I tasted too much sherry
while I was cooking.

759
00:52:38,207 --> 00:52:42,268
You cooked for me?
No man has ever done that for me before.

760
00:52:42,345 --> 00:52:44,779
I'm famished.

761
00:52:44,847 --> 00:52:48,248
Actually, I didn't cook... here...

762
00:52:48,317 --> 00:52:50,911
at my apartment... for us.

763
00:52:50,987 --> 00:52:55,981
I cooked... at Catch's apartment
for... Catch.

764
00:52:56,059 --> 00:53:00,086
- Oh.
- But you've only been here a minute.

765
00:53:00,163 --> 00:53:03,860
Let's make it 10 and see
if we forget all about dinner.

766
00:53:09,172 --> 00:53:12,141
- [Vikki] Are those your parents?
- No. Those are Catch's parents.

767
00:53:12,208 --> 00:53:15,473
Why do you have a picture
of Catch's parents?

768
00:53:16,512 --> 00:53:19,743
Let's listen to some music.

769
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:30,823
[Whirring]

770
00:53:33,696 --> 00:53:38,429
[Stereo: "1812 Overture'"

771
00:53:39,435 --> 00:53:41,767
[Continues]

772
00:53:41,838 --> 00:53:44,500
It's all right. It's all right.

773
00:53:44,574 --> 00:53:47,338
[Both]
Ooh!

774
00:53:47,410 --> 00:53:49,605
- [Slingshot Sound]
- Ooh!

[Both Gasp]

776
00:53:53,783 --> 00:53:56,616
Ooh!

777
00:53:56,686 --> 00:54:00,713
I can't do this for eight more minutes.
Let's go eat.

00:54:00,790 --> 00:54:03,691
- [Vikki Screeches]

00:54:07,830 --> 00:54:11,027
- [Catcher] How's that?
- [Barbara] Oh.

780
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:14,160
[Catcher]
You tell me when it's good for you.

781
00:54:14,237 --> 00:54:18,799
Put your hand on it and guide me
till I got it in the right spot.

782
00:54:18,875 --> 00:54:22,675
[Barbara]
Almost. Almost.

783
00:54:22,745 --> 00:54:24,838
Oh, Zip.

784
00:54:24,914 --> 00:54:30,443
I've done this a lot before, of course,
but never with such a powerful instrument.

785
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:35,321
[Barbara Gasps]
That's it.

786
00:54:35,391 --> 00:54:39,418
It's perfectly clear.

787
00:54:42,532 --> 00:54:46,662
Oh, Zip, I've never seen anything
so beautiful...

788
00:54:46,736 --> 00:54:48,897
in all my life.

789
00:54:48,971 --> 00:54:53,408
- Neither have I.
- You're not even looking
through the telescope.

790
00:54:53,476 --> 00:54:55,944
I know.

791
00:55:14,764 --> 00:55:18,029
This chocolate souffle
is delicious, Zip.

792
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:20,796
You've really outdone yourself.

793
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:24,067
- I wanted the perfect end
to the perfect evening.
- Mm.

794
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:27,507
I've never been more ready
to go to bed.

795
00:55:27,577 --> 00:55:32,173
Oh, Zip, I'm so glad
that you feel that way.

796
00:55:32,248 --> 00:55:36,548
- You know that I feel the same way?
- Well, then, let's get to bed.

797
00:55:36,619 --> 00:55:40,453
- [Inhales Deeply]
- I'll call you a taxi.

- Taxi?
- [Dial Tone]

799
00:55:46,262 --> 00:55:52,132
Oh, when I said bed,
you thought I meant bed.

800
00:55:52,201 --> 00:55:55,136
Oh, Barbara, I'm so sorry.

801
00:55:55,204 --> 00:55:58,173
This is only the first time you've ever
been to my home, and where I come from...

802
00:55:58,241 --> 00:56:02,075
It's all right, Zip.

803
00:56:02,144 --> 00:56:06,581
It's all right.
Um, it's better this way.

804
00:56:08,217 --> 00:56:12,586
Let's, um...
Let's just say good night...

805
00:56:14,490 --> 00:56:16,856
and good-bye.

806
00:56:16,926 --> 00:56:20,293
- Good-bye? You mean for good?
- I'm afraid so, Zip.

807
00:56:20,363 --> 00:56:23,264
You see,
I'm beginning to feel...

808
00:56:23,332 --> 00:56:26,267
Well, I'm beginning to feel.

809
00:56:26,335 --> 00:56:30,169
Well, couldn't you give me
just one more chance?

810
00:56:30,239 --> 00:56:34,232
Oh, I'd like to, Zip,
really, I would...

811
00:56:34,310 --> 00:56:37,279
but just the fact that I'd like to
give you another chance...

812
00:56:37,346 --> 00:56:41,510
is the very reason
why I absolutely must not.

813
00:57:14,183 --> 00:57:17,209
Okay. One more chance.

814
00:57:20,222 --> 00:57:24,625
[Clears Throat]
I'll just, um...

815
00:57:24,694 --> 00:57:27,390
Hmm.

816
00:58:00,863 --> 00:58:04,128
[Laughter, Chattering]

817
00:58:11,707 --> 00:58:14,642
[Chattering Continues]

818
00:58:35,297 --> 00:58:38,425
- Peter?
- You rang?

819
00:58:38,501 --> 00:58:41,470
No. I used my key, Maynard.
How did everyone else get in here?

820
00:58:41,537 --> 00:58:44,973
I took Vikki down to the Village
for a demitasse. Crazy!

821
00:58:45,041 --> 00:58:48,738
And then the coffeehouse got raided,
so I moved the scene uptown.

822
00:58:48,811 --> 00:58:52,645
- You dig, Daddy-O?
- Oh, I do dig.

823
00:58:52,715 --> 00:58:58,017
And after being grounded for 24 days,
this astronaut is ready to blast off.

824
00:59:03,459 --> 00:59:07,088
- Ask me why I mourn.
- Why do you mourn, baby?

825
00:59:07,163 --> 00:59:10,223
I mourn because you are shrouded
in the suit and tie...

826
00:59:10,299 --> 00:59:12,995
that Madison Avenue
will bury you in alive.

827
00:59:13,069 --> 00:59:17,028
Well, if it'll cheer you up,
you can help me out of it.

828
00:59:30,886 --> 00:59:32,085
- Hi!
- Hi! Coffee?

829
00:59:32,085 --> 00:59:34,781
- Hi!
- Hi! Coffee?

830
00:59:34,854 --> 00:59:38,221
So, this is a beatnik party.

831
00:59:38,291 --> 00:59:40,691
- Isn't it a gas?
- Yes!

filled my pipe with some tobacco
she bought in San Francisco.

at a party like that?

gonna be a party here.

who wanted to do a cover story
on my NASA top-secret project.

and that guy does not even show up.

- No!

870
01:02:16,148 --> 01:02:20,847
and then you went
and made the trick seem so obvious.

Oh, Zip, I didn't mean
to make you feel bad.

the final straw. This has to be the end.

01:12:06,970 --> 01:12:10,838
Are you in the mood, Zip?

993
01:12:15,211 --> 01:12:18,647
Yes, Barbara, I am.

994
01:12:33,163 --> 01:12:35,097
Mm.

995
01:12:35,165 --> 01:12:38,225
Oh. Oh.

996
01:12:38,301 --> 01:12:41,270
- Darling?
- [Moans]

997
01:12:41,337 --> 01:12:43,271
- No.
- No?

998
01:12:43,339 --> 01:12:45,569
After you've waited all this time,
and now you're saying no?

999
01:12:45,642 --> 01:12:50,011
- Yes. There's something
I wanna tell you.
- Oh.

1000
01:12:54,284 --> 01:12:58,880
- Yes, Barbara Novak, tell me anything.
- [Barbara Moans]

1001
01:12:58,955 --> 01:13:02,686
- I love you.
- Tell me how much, Barbara Novak.

1002
01:13:02,759 --> 01:13:06,525
Too much.
[Gasping] Ohh.

1003
01:13:06,596 --> 01:13:09,156
Too much.
Too much to have sex with you.

1004
01:13:09,232 --> 01:13:13,328
Right.
Because you are Barbara Novak.

1005
01:13:13,403 --> 01:13:16,566
- Mm.
- Author of Down With Love.

1006
01:13:16,639 --> 01:13:20,871
And you do not believe
in having sex with feelings.

1007
01:13:20,944 --> 01:13:24,846
No. That's not why
I want you to stop.

1008
01:13:24,914 --> 01:13:29,180
I want you to stop because I love you too
much to have sex without marrying you.

1009
01:13:29,252 --> 01:13:34,554
I want what every woman wants:
Love and marriage.

1010
01:13:34,624 --> 01:13:39,755
I'm not a Down With Love girl.
I'm not the girl you think I am.

1011
01:13:39,829 --> 01:13:42,821
Oh, you are exactly
the girl I think you are.

1012
01:13:57,080 --> 01:14:00,846
- [Gwendolyn] Catcher Block!
- [Record Scratches]

1013
01:14:00,917 --> 01:14:03,078
You're getting sloppy.!

1014
01:14:03,153 --> 01:14:06,919
Leaving a key on the outside
when you're busy on the inside?

1015
01:14:06,990 --> 01:14:11,552
Oh, why the long faces? We're all equal,
self-reliant citizens of the world here.

1016
01:14:11,628 --> 01:14:13,528
I know I am, and heaven knows
all men are.

1017
01:14:13,596 --> 01:14:16,531
And you're with Catch Block,
so I hope you are.

1018
01:14:16,599 --> 01:14:20,262
Anyway, I just popped by
for a little sex a la carte.

1019
01:14:20,336 --> 01:14:25,171
But since you're busy, I'll just ring up
my crew captain at the hotel.

1020
01:14:26,176 --> 01:14:31,170
- Cheerio!
- [Door Closes]

1021
01:14:35,852 --> 01:14:40,689
[British Accent]
All right. Now you know.

1022
01:14:40,822 --> 01:14:44,280
I'm Catcher Block,
not Zip Martin.

1023
01:14:44,359 --> 01:14:47,157
There is no Zip Martin.

1024
01:14:48,663 --> 01:14:54,397
But before you storm out of here,
admit it: I got you.

1025
01:14:54,469 --> 01:14:58,371
I got Barbara "Down With Love'" Novak
to fall in love.

1026
01:15:06,147 --> 01:15:08,945
I'm not gonna storm
out of here, Catch.

1027
01:15:09,017 --> 01:15:13,511
And I'm not gonna admit that you got
Barbara Novak to fall in love...

1028
01:15:13,588 --> 01:15:16,421
because I'm not Barbara Novak.

1029
01:15:16,491 --> 01:15:19,483
- There is no Barbara Novak.
- Huh?

1030
01:15:19,561 --> 01:15:24,624
I didn't fall in love with Zip Martin.
I fell in love with Catcher Block.

1031
01:15:24,699 --> 01:15:28,760
And that was a year ago,
when for three and a half weeks,
I worked as your secretary.

1032
01:15:28,837 --> 01:15:32,933
I don't expect you to
remember me. I wasn't a blond
then. But you did ask me out.

1033
01:15:33,007 --> 01:15:37,239
And it broke my heart to say no,
but I loved you too much.

1034
01:15:37,312 --> 01:15:40,509
I couldn't bear to become
just another notch in your bedpost.

1035
01:15:40,582 --> 01:15:43,244
With your dating habits, I knew
that even if I was lucky enough...

1036
01:15:43,318 --> 01:15:46,685
to get a regular spot
on your rotating schedule...

1037
01:15:46,755 --> 01:15:51,055
I would never have your
undivided attention long enough
for you to fall in love with me.

1038
01:15:51,126 --> 01:15:54,892
I knew I had to do something
to set myself apart.

1039
01:15:54,963 --> 01:15:57,625
I knew I had to quit my job
as your secretary...

1040
01:15:57,699 --> 01:16:02,534
and write an international best-seller
controversial enough...

1041
01:16:02,604 --> 01:16:06,540
to get the attention of a New York
publisher as well as KNOW magazine...

1042
01:16:06,608 --> 01:16:11,170
but insignificant enough
that as long as I went unseen,
KNOW magazine's star journalist...

1043
01:16:11,246 --> 01:16:13,714
would refuse
to do a cover story about it.

1044
01:16:13,782 --> 01:16:16,478
I knew that every time we were supposed
to meet, you would get distracted...

1045
01:16:16,551 --> 01:16:19,384
by one of your many girlfriends
and stand me up...

1046
01:16:19,454 --> 01:16:22,082
and this would give me a reason
to fight with you over the phone...

1047
01:16:22,157 --> 01:16:25,684
and declare that I wouldn't meet
with you for a hundred years.

1048
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:29,594
And then all I would have to do
was be patient and wait...

1049
01:16:29,664 --> 01:16:32,497
the two or three weeks it would take
for everyone in the world...

1050
01:16:32,567 --> 01:16:34,831
to buy a copy of my best-seller...

1051
01:16:34,903 --> 01:16:37,997
and then I would begin to get
the publicity I would need for you...

1052
01:16:38,072 --> 01:16:42,065
to, one, see what I look like, and, two, see
me denounce you in public...

1053
01:16:42,143 --> 01:16:44,611
as the worst kind of man.

1054
01:16:44,679 --> 01:16:48,615
I knew this would make you wanna
get even by writing one of your exposes.

1055
01:16:48,683 --> 01:16:51,208
And in order to do that,
you would have to go undercover...

1056
01:16:51,286 --> 01:16:54,483
assume a false identity
and pretend to be the kind of man...

1057
01:16:54,556 --> 01:16:57,753
who would make the kind of girl
I was pretending to be fall in love.

1058
01:16:57,826 --> 01:17:01,694
Since I was pretending to be a girl
who would have sex on the first date...

1059
01:17:01,763 --> 01:17:05,529
you would have to pretend to be a man
who wouldn't have sex for several dates.

1060
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:09,434
And in doing so,
we would go out on lots of dates...

1061
01:17:09,504 --> 01:17:13,099
to all the best places
and all the hit shows...

1062
01:17:13,174 --> 01:17:17,338
until finally, one night, you would
take me back to your place...

1063
01:17:17,412 --> 01:17:19,642
that you were pretending
was someone else's...

1064
01:17:19,714 --> 01:17:23,548
in order to get the evidence you needed
to write your expose...

1065
01:17:23,618 --> 01:17:29,181
by seducing me
until I said, "I love you."

1066
01:17:29,257 --> 01:17:34,695
But saying "I love you"
was also my plan.

1067
01:17:34,762 --> 01:17:38,721
I just wanted to tell you
the truth so that when you
heard me say, "I love you"...

1068
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:42,600
you would know that I knew who you were,
and you would know who I was.

1069
01:17:42,670 --> 01:17:45,696
Then you, the great Catcher Block...

1070
01:17:45,773 --> 01:17:50,039
would know that you'd
been beaten at your own game...

1071
01:17:50,111 --> 01:17:54,343
by me, Nancy Brown,
your former secretary.

1072
01:17:54,415 --> 01:17:58,283
And I would have,
once and for all, set myself apart...

1073
01:17:58,353 --> 01:18:01,914
from all the other girls
you've known, all those other girls...

1074
01:18:01,990 --> 01:18:06,188
that you never really cared about,
by making myself someone...

1075
01:18:06,261 --> 01:18:10,960
like the one person
you really love and admire...

1076
01:18:11,032 --> 01:18:14,934
above all others: You.

1077
01:18:15,003 --> 01:18:18,461
Then, when you realized that you
had finally met your match...

1078
01:18:18,539 --> 01:18:21,906
I would have at last
gained the respect...

1079
01:18:21,976 --> 01:18:27,812
that would make you wanna
marry me first and seduce me later.

1080
01:18:32,954 --> 01:18:37,357
I just wanted you to hear
all this from me before you
heard it from your private eye.

1081
01:18:37,425 --> 01:18:40,792
[Telephone Rings]

1082
01:18:42,997 --> 01:18:45,795
- Yeah?
- Block, McNulty.

1083
01:18:45,867 --> 01:18:48,995
Got everything there is on Novak,
and it's nothing.

1084
01:18:49,070 --> 01:18:52,597
Novak doesn't exist except
for a P.O. Box in Maine...

1085
01:18:52,674 --> 01:18:55,438
in care of one Nancy Brown
of 28 Gramercy Park...

1086
01:18:55,510 --> 01:18:58,775
where she was born and raised.

1087
01:18:58,846 --> 01:19:01,815
And while our Nancy may have
broken a few hearts growing up...

1088
01:19:01,883 --> 01:19:05,979
I can't find the guy we're lookin' for
who broke hers.

1089
01:19:06,054 --> 01:19:10,388
Never mind. I found him.

1090
01:19:15,063 --> 01:19:19,796
So, now you know everything.

1091
01:19:19,867 --> 01:19:23,234
Now tell me
the one thing I don't know.

1092
01:19:23,304 --> 01:19:26,467
Tell me if this plan
of mine has worked.

1093
01:19:26,541 --> 01:19:32,309
Tell me if it's made you
fall in love with me, as I love you.

1094
01:19:50,164 --> 01:19:55,227
- Come on. We're going out.
- Out? Now? Why?

1095
01:19:55,303 --> 01:19:58,739
Because no wife of mine belongs
in an apartment like this.

1096
01:19:58,806 --> 01:20:00,467
Wife?

1097
01:20:00,541 --> 01:20:02,668
- You will marry me, won't you, Barbara?
- Nancy.

1098
01:20:02,744 --> 01:20:06,236
- Nancy.
- Oh, Catch.

1099
01:20:06,314 --> 01:20:09,442
It's all I've ever wanted.

1100
01:20:14,055 --> 01:20:17,218
- Are you sure it's what you want?
- Of course I'm sure.

1101
01:20:17,291 --> 01:20:20,488
I've met my match. There's only
been one thing between us...

1102
01:20:20,561 --> 01:20:24,190
and that's gone now that you're done
pretending to be Barbara Novak.

1103
01:20:24,265 --> 01:20:27,701
You are Barbara Novak!
Oh, I didn't realize!

1104
01:20:27,769 --> 01:20:30,203
You are my heroine!

1105
01:20:30,271 --> 01:20:33,240
Oh, of course you are. You're the heroine
of all women around the world.

1106
01:20:33,307 --> 01:20:36,868
But you saved my life. Oh, I'm still
flying friendly in the skies...

1107
01:20:36,944 --> 01:20:39,606
but now I decide how friendly
and when and with whom.

1108
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:44,879
Oh, and I'm also training for my pilot's
license! And I have you to thank for it.

1109
01:20:44,952 --> 01:20:49,787
Thank you, Barbara Novak.
Thank you for all womankind.

1110
01:20:58,933 --> 01:21:02,835
- [Door Closes]
- [Catcher] Wow. You are something else.

1111
01:21:02,904 --> 01:21:06,965
You didn'tjust fool me,
you fooled the whole world.

1112
01:21:07,041 --> 01:21:10,101
But now we can
set the whole world straight.

1113
01:21:10,178 --> 01:21:13,011
Our marriage will end
the battle of the sexes.

1114
01:21:13,081 --> 01:21:16,642
Boy, this cover story's
not just the Pulitzer.
This could be the Nobel Peace Prize.

1115
01:21:16,717 --> 01:21:19,515
Catch, you're not still going to
write your expose, are you?

1116
01:21:19,587 --> 01:21:22,715
- Why not?
- Well, you know why not.

1117
01:21:22,790 --> 01:21:25,657
All the women in the world,
they look to me.

1118
01:21:25,726 --> 01:21:28,217
The expose can't hurt you now.

1119
01:21:28,296 --> 01:21:31,129
You're gonna have everything
you've ever wished for.

1120
01:21:31,199 --> 01:21:34,760
You'll be Mrs. Catcher Block, living
in our dream house in the suburbs...

1121
01:21:34,836 --> 01:21:37,327
with a yard full of noisy kids...

1122
01:21:37,405 --> 01:21:40,169
you putting them to bed, then you and me
having a quiet dinner.

1123
01:21:40,241 --> 01:21:46,111
Catch, stop. I can't do this.

1124
01:21:46,180 --> 01:21:50,844
Barbara, stop! Don't do this!
He's not who he says he is!

1125
01:21:53,621 --> 01:21:59,116
Neither am I.
Good-bye, Catch.

1126
01:22:03,364 --> 01:22:06,492
Good-bye?

1127
01:22:09,036 --> 01:22:11,869
[Grunts]

1128
01:22:14,609 --> 01:22:16,975
- Barbara?
- Vikki.!

1129
01:22:17,044 --> 01:22:20,673
- Nancy!
- Who are you calling Nancy?

1130
01:22:20,748 --> 01:22:24,485
- Hey, wait, wait. Please let me explain.
- There is no explanation.

1131
01:22:24,618 --> 01:22:28,315
Deceiving the girl you're going to marry
about your homosexuality is one thing.

1132
01:22:28,388 --> 01:22:30,583
Deceiving me in business
is another.

1133
01:22:30,657 --> 01:22:32,784
I thought you were different,
but you're not.

1134
01:22:32,860 --> 01:22:37,320
You're a rat, Peter MacMannus.
You're just like every other man.

1135
01:22:42,469 --> 01:22:46,098
I'm just like every other man.

1136
01:22:58,785 --> 01:23:01,413
Peter MacMannus.
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

1137
01:23:01,488 --> 01:23:04,286
What do you say we step inside?

1138
01:23:04,358 --> 01:23:06,292
- Well...
- Just for 10 minutes.

1139
01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:08,385
- Ten minutes?
- Ten minutes.

1140
01:23:08,462 --> 01:23:12,262
Nancy, wait!
What do you mean, you can't do this?

1141
01:23:12,332 --> 01:23:14,926
- I mean I can't marry you.
- What?

1142
01:23:15,002 --> 01:23:17,835
I can't be Mrs. Catcher Block.

1143
01:23:17,905 --> 01:23:21,932
I can't be your wife with the kids
and the house in the suburbs.

1144
01:23:22,009 --> 01:23:24,876
There was one part of my plan
that I didn't count on:

1145
01:23:24,945 --> 01:23:28,108
That by pretending
to be Barbara Novak...

1146
01:23:28,181 --> 01:23:30,979
I would actually

I may be the last woman in the world
to do it, but I have finally...

1148
01:23:34,288 --> 01:23:38,224
become a Down With Love girl,
level three.

1149
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:44,420
I don't want love,
and I don't want you.

01:24:31,211 --> 01:24:34,271
- What did Vikki say? Any luck?
- Nope.

1153
01:24:34,348 --> 01:24:36,839
Barbara still doesn't
want to see you.

1154
01:24:36,917 --> 01:24:39,886
She's thrown away
everything you sent her...

1155
01:24:39,953 --> 01:24:44,947
the flowers, the candy, the $6,000
state-of-the-art Celestron telescope...

1156
01:24:45,025 --> 01:24:48,517
that wasn't really for you to send,
because it was mine, not yours.

1157
01:24:48,595 --> 01:24:51,564
- She hates me.
- At least Novak dropped you flat.

1158

You know where you stand.

1159
01:24:54,101 --> 01:24:57,366
Sometimes I think Vikki only started
talking marriage to me that night...

1160
01:24:57,437 --> 01:25:00,167
in order to get me
to have sex with her.

1161
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:05,177
Once I did, I hardly ever see her,
except when she comes back for more.

1162
01:25:05,245 --> 01:25:09,978
And I always give in.
Makes me feel so used.

01:25:10,050 --> 01:25:13,884
[Slurps] It's just not right.!
I shouldn't feel used.!

1164
01:25:13,954 --> 01:25:17,412
She should, but she's
taking her cues from Novak.

1165
01:25:17,491 --> 01:25:21,552
That's why you have to get to Novak.
You have to solve this, Catch.

1166
01:25:21,628 --> 01:25:24,392
You have to squash her, crush her...

1167
01:25:24,464 --> 01:25:26,762
if not for the sake of civilization,
then just for me.

1168

- I don't wanna crush her. I love her.
- All right. Fine.

1169
01:25:30,137 --> 01:25:32,128
So run with that then.

1170
01:25:32,205 --> 01:25:35,902
What happened to your idea about making
your expose into a public love letter?

1171
01:25:35,976 --> 01:25:39,002
That's no good. She's down with love...
for real this time.

Come on. Get dressed.

start circulating again.

- It's only money.

Besides,
I've been on top for so long...

to the top.

1245
01:30:58,630 --> 01:31:03,761
Still, I'm afraid
that a man of your experience...

1246
01:31:03,835 --> 01:31:07,202
would be too distracted working
in a predominantly female workplace.

1247
01:31:07,271 --> 01:31:12,834
Not at all. You see, I'm not really
interested in women a la carte anymore.

01:31:12,910 --> 01:31:16,073
The next time I get involved with
a woman, it'll be to settle down.

of the women from my workforce...

in a house in the suburbs.

to win a Nobel prize.

1260

I never said a word
about Nancy Brown.

1304
01:36:27,156 --> 01:36:30,887
I've got a thirst that's legendary

1305
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:35,021
That's why I fired your secretary

1306
01:36:35,098 --> 01:36:38,090
[Both]
Cheers, here's to love

1307
01:36:38,167 --> 01:36:42,365
- Life's a martini
- And you're the shaker

1308
01:36:42,438 --> 01:36:46,135
- And, baby, I sure packed a punch
- Hey!

1309
01:36:46,209 --> 01:36:49,872
You make Dean Martin
look like a Quaker

1310
01:36:49,946 --> 01:36:52,506
- But now it's only you for dinner
- Breakfast.

1311
01:36:52,582 --> 01:36:57,349
- And lunch.
- I hear the march
that's calling for us

1312
01:36:57,420 --> 01:37:01,049
We'll walk down the aisle
to an angels' chorus

1313
01:37:01,124 --> 01:37:05,458
I'll be your Rock
if you'll be my Doris

1314
01:37:05,528 --> 01:37:09,055
[Both]
Sweet heavens above

1315
01:37:09,132 --> 01:37:12,329
Why is the waiter smiling at us

1316
01:37:12,402 --> 01:37:15,530
He knows what we're thinking of

1317
01:37:15,605 --> 01:37:18,836
- Oh, can the tears
- [Both] Cheers

1318
01:37:18,908 --> 01:37:24,005
Baby, here's to love

1319
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:27,914
You've got the lips
to wet my whistle

1320
01:37:27,984 --> 01:37:31,977
If that doesn't get ya
maybe this'll

1321
01:37:32,055 --> 01:37:36,048
Cupid just launched
a guided missile

1322
01:37:36,125 --> 01:37:39,322
[Both]
Cheers, here's to love

1323
01:37:39,395 --> 01:37:43,388
Your eyes are so intoxicating

1324
01:37:43,466 --> 01:37:47,027
Bottoms up, babe
let's get to mating

1325
01:37:47,103 --> 01:37:51,267
I bet it bears re-it-erating

1326
01:37:51,340 --> 01:37:54,639
[Both]
Cheers, here's to love

1327
01:37:54,710 --> 01:37:58,168
Though it ain't New Year's
pop the champagne

1328
01:37:58,247 --> 01:38:02,240
And let's take a spin
on the floor

1329
01:38:02,318 --> 01:38:05,651
- Your moves are good
- I'm feelin' no pain

1330
01:38:05,721 --> 01:38:09,953
[Both] So let's pay the check
and slip out the back door

1331
01:38:10,026 --> 01:38:13,723
We took Manhattan
without the bitters

1332
01:38:13,796 --> 01:38:17,630
We're stayin' put
Last call's for quitters

1333
01:38:17,700 --> 01:38:21,192
Soon it will be
just baby-sitters

1334
01:38:21,270 --> 01:38:25,263
'Cause this hawk's now a dove

1335
01:38:25,341 --> 01:38:28,469
Baby, the cab is blowin' its horn

1336
01:38:28,544 --> 01:38:31,843
But I can't find my hat
and my gloves

1337
01:38:31,914 --> 01:38:34,940
- Oh, can the tears
- [Both] Cheers

1338
01:38:35,017 --> 01:38:40,785
Baby, here's to love

1339
01:38:40,857 --> 01:38:43,587
- Here's mud in your eye.
- Here's lookin' at you, kid.

1340
01:38:43,659 --> 01:38:46,457
- Here. This'll put hairs on your chest.
- [Chuckles]

1341
01:38:46,529 --> 01:38:49,123
- Not that I would want that.
- Mm-hmm.

1342
01:38:49,198 --> 01:38:53,100
Here's to love

1343
01:38:53,169 --> 01:38:56,536
