00:08:29,018 --> 00:08:30,718
Oh, there she is.

188
00:08:30,752 --> 00:08:33,586
Marie!

189
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,686
Oh. Oh, it's heavy.

190
00:08:36,721 --> 00:08:37,988
Excuse me, sir.

191
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,354
Would you mind
stopping--

192
00:08:39,388 --> 00:08:41,221
[shrieks]

193
00:08:41,256 --> 00:08:42,855
[splashing]

194
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:44,756
Mum!

195
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:51,691
Don't worry, ma'am.
I'm comin'.

196
00:08:56,459 --> 00:08:59,327
[Marie coughing]

197
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,161
[all talking]

198
00:09:04,028 --> 00:09:06,229
[gasps]

199
00:09:10,863 --> 00:09:12,664
Apparently, I missed
the delta waters

200
00:09:12,697 --> 00:09:14,365
more than I knew.

201
00:09:14,398 --> 00:09:16,932
[laughing]
Oh, thank you,
thank you.

202
00:09:16,965 --> 00:09:19,000
So much trouble
for such an old maid.

203
00:09:19,033 --> 00:09:20,867
Miss,

204
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,400
I'd do it again.

205
00:09:22,434 --> 00:09:24,268
It's kinda hot out here,
anyway.

206
00:09:24,301 --> 00:09:25,269
[laughing]

207
00:09:25,301 --> 00:09:27,502
Enough of that.

208
00:09:27,536 --> 00:09:28,669
It'll go to his head,

209
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:30,670
and I'll get
a week of sulking

210
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:32,703
and slow service
out of him.

211
00:09:32,737 --> 00:09:34,371
Sir, he dove in
to save a woman's life,

212
00:09:34,404 --> 00:09:36,738
while the rest of you
stood by,

213
00:09:36,771 --> 00:09:38,005
checking your watch fobs.

214
00:09:38,038 --> 00:09:40,206
(man)
There are laws
against sassing.

215
00:09:42,307 --> 00:09:44,874
Better learn that
for your own good.

216
00:09:44,908 --> 00:09:46,974
[gulls squawking]

217
00:09:47,974 --> 00:09:49,342
(man)
Jacques.

218
00:09:49,376 --> 00:09:50,543
Clean yourself up.

219
00:09:50,575 --> 00:09:53,277
I don't want people thinkin'
that we dress you like that.

220
00:09:58,611 --> 00:10:00,912
Looks like
main street in Sodom.

221
00:10:00,946 --> 00:10:04,313
How can you make me
leave Charleston for this?

222
00:10:04,346 --> 00:10:06,381
Look at them
paradin' around.

223
00:10:07,414 --> 00:10:08,414
Give it time, dear.

224
00:10:08,447 --> 00:10:09,948
Things are gonna change.

225
00:10:09,981 --> 00:10:11,315
[goat bleats]

226
00:10:11,348 --> 00:10:14,950
Well, is anyone else
for a swim?

227
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:16,316
Allow me
to introduce myself.

228
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,517
I am Gerard Gaultier.

229
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:20,684
My parents have just taken up
residence in a plantation

230
00:10:20,718 --> 00:10:21,752
up near Pontchartrain.

231
00:10:21,785 --> 00:10:22,753
Enchantée.

232
00:10:22,785 --> 00:10:23,653
I'm Marie Alicot.

233
00:10:23,685 --> 00:10:25,619
These are my good
friends Julie Gadin

234
00:10:25,653 --> 00:10:26,819
and Henriette DeLille.

235
00:10:26,853 --> 00:10:27,986
Uh, welcome
to New Orleans.

236
00:10:28,021 --> 00:10:30,887
Would you do me the honor
of allowing me to see you home?

237
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:33,389
We have our own carriage,
but thank you.

238
00:10:33,422 --> 00:10:35,289
Then at least
I can carry your things.

239
00:10:35,323 --> 00:10:36,356
Well, well, well.

240
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:37,423
[clears throat]

241
00:10:37,456 --> 00:10:39,356
The accent's not
from the West Indies.

242
00:10:39,391 --> 00:10:40,357
I think
he's from France.

243
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,458
You can always ask him
at the ball next week.

244
00:10:42,491 --> 00:10:44,258
I'm not going to the ball.

245
00:10:44,292 --> 00:10:46,626
But...it's been arranged.

246
00:10:46,659 --> 00:10:48,760
Oh, I saw
my father today.

247
00:10:48,792 --> 00:10:50,928
Of course,
he didn't see me.

248
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,261
I don't want that--not for me,
not for my children.

249
00:10:54,295 --> 00:10:57,029
(Marie)
I expect you'll be telling
your mother soon.

250
00:10:57,062 --> 00:10:59,263
She'll understand.

251
00:10:59,296 --> 00:11:00,330
Mm-hmm.

252
00:11:00,363 --> 00:11:03,664
Ah, you've
imported rocks?

253
00:11:03,697 --> 00:11:05,365
[laughing]
They're books.

254
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:07,365
We're teachers
at the parish school,

255
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:09,033
and Marie's a missionary.

256
00:11:09,066 --> 00:11:10,066
Oh, wonderful.

257
00:11:10,099 --> 00:11:14,267
This will be difficult
to accomplish with dignity.

258
00:11:14,301 --> 00:11:16,035
I'm sure you'll be able
to manage somehow.

259
00:11:16,068 --> 00:11:18,035
Oh, only with
your steadfast belief

260
00:11:18,069 --> 00:11:20,436
and encouragement,
mademoiselle.

261
00:11:21,937 --> 00:11:23,303
[clears throat]

262
00:11:25,804 --> 00:11:27,972
(Henriette and children)
One, two, three, four.

263
00:11:28,004 --> 00:11:30,039
(Henriette)
Excellent.
That's it for today.

264
00:11:30,072 --> 00:11:31,306
Au revoir. Merci.

265
00:11:31,339 --> 00:11:33,639
(children)
Au revoir.

266
00:11:33,674 --> 00:11:35,340
Thank you.
Au revoir.

267
00:11:35,373 --> 00:11:38,474
Au revoir.
Merci. Au revoir.

268
00:11:38,508 --> 00:11:41,008
Au revoir, merci.

269
00:11:41,043 --> 00:11:44,610
[girls chatting]

270
00:11:44,642 --> 00:11:46,743
Take your seats.

271
00:11:46,778 --> 00:11:48,045
Simone.

272
00:11:48,077 --> 00:11:50,612
I'm so glad we found
your parish, Father Rousselon.

273
00:11:50,645 --> 00:11:52,879
The cathedral seemed--
well, full of foreigners.

274
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:54,745
And we're glad
to find you,
Mrs. Morgan,

275
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,947
and to have
your husband--

276
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:56,947
'Scuse me.

277
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,314
As a warden.

278
00:11:58,347 --> 00:11:59,315
(Henriette)
D.

279
00:11:59,348 --> 00:12:00,682
(girls)
D.

280
00:12:00,714 --> 00:12:04,249
A catechism class
for girls this late?

281
00:12:05,082 --> 00:12:06,683
Très bien,
 Simone.

282
00:12:06,716 --> 00:12:08,250
[gasps]

283
00:12:11,418 --> 00:12:12,318
Slave children?

284
00:12:12,352 --> 00:12:15,953
Mrs. Morgan, slaves
are God's children too.

285
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:18,620
We are allowed
to teach them at night.

286
00:12:18,653 --> 00:12:19,954
Henriette.

287
00:12:21,087 --> 00:12:22,388
Bonsoir,
 Father.

288
00:12:22,421 --> 00:12:23,121
(Rousselon)
Bonsoir.

289
00:12:23,154 --> 00:12:24,622
(girls)
Bonsoir,
 Father.

290
00:12:24,655 --> 00:12:26,690
This is our newest
student, Simone.

291
00:12:26,722 --> 00:12:28,923
Her father will bring her
to church on Sunday.

292
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:31,623
That's my Jacques'
daughter.

293
00:12:31,657 --> 00:12:33,925
I can read, Father.

294
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:34,959
Very good.
Well--

295
00:12:34,991 --> 00:12:35,959
Very good.

296
00:12:35,992 --> 00:12:38,793
Teaching coloreds to read
requires permission.

297
00:12:44,661 --> 00:12:47,062
(Henriette)
God...

298
00:12:47,095 --> 00:12:49,429
is...love.

299
00:12:49,463 --> 00:12:50,697
Repeat.

300
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:53,397
(girls)
God is love.

301
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:54,064
[laughing]

302
00:12:54,097 --> 00:12:55,431
Excellent.

303
00:13:01,433 --> 00:13:05,400
Henriette, do you have
their permission?

304
00:13:05,434 --> 00:13:07,068
You know it's illegal
to teach slaves to read

305
00:13:07,101 --> 00:13:10,402
without their masters' consent.

306
00:13:10,435 --> 00:13:13,336
How can they learn
the catechism
unless they read it?

307
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:14,737
How can they
truly worship

308
00:13:14,769 --> 00:13:16,337
if they can't read
the Bible?

309
00:13:16,371 --> 00:13:19,805
Do the masters
know, Henriette?

310
00:13:19,838 --> 00:13:22,272
God knows.

311
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:54,782
(Pouponne)
Henriette, what is this
I have heard?

312
00:13:54,816 --> 00:13:56,849
You are teaching
slave children?

313
00:13:56,882 --> 00:13:58,883
Do you want to hurt
your father?

314
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:00,050
Do you realize

315
00:14:00,084 --> 00:14:01,951
he does business
with their masters?

316
00:14:01,984 --> 00:14:03,684
And the sons
of those masters

317
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:05,585
will be attending
your ball this week.

318
00:14:05,619 --> 00:14:07,086
Maman,
 about the ball--

319
00:14:07,119 --> 00:14:09,586
Do you want them laughing
at you behind your back?

320
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,387
Do you want them
to wash their hands

321
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:13,420
after they've finished
dancing with you?

322
00:14:13,455 --> 00:14:15,088
[chuckling]

323
00:14:15,122 --> 00:14:18,356
(Pouponne)
Henriette, I have
asked you a question.

324
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:19,423
Papa?

325
00:14:31,493 --> 00:14:32,526
[giggles]

326
00:14:33,827 --> 00:14:35,294
[whispers fiercely]
No.

327
00:14:36,829 --> 00:14:40,729
You will not
parade your heart.

328
00:14:40,763 --> 00:14:44,663
You want these
white bastards to see?

329
00:14:52,432 --> 00:14:54,400
Unh.
Come on, Ree.

330
00:14:54,433 --> 00:14:56,033
She'll blame me
if you're not ready.

331
00:14:56,067 --> 00:14:57,034
I hate this.

332
00:14:57,067 --> 00:15:00,602
You know
how much I do.

333
00:15:00,635 --> 00:15:04,502
Ooh, Maman was right
about the green.

334
00:15:06,136 --> 00:15:08,404
Do you love him?

335
00:15:08,437 --> 00:15:09,538
Who?

336
00:15:09,571 --> 00:15:11,405
Oh, Samuel?

337
00:15:11,438 --> 00:15:12,705
Yes.

338
00:15:12,739 --> 00:15:16,106
He has promised
that we will be together

339
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:19,073
until we're old
and crotchety.

340
00:15:19,108 --> 00:15:21,041
But you can't marry,
Célie.

341
00:15:21,075 --> 00:15:22,409
What difference
does it make

342
00:15:22,441 --> 00:15:24,442
if he stays with me?

343
00:15:24,476 --> 00:15:28,410
[sighs]
God means us to be married
till death parts us,

344
00:15:28,443 --> 00:15:32,044
to walk across a square openly,
as man and wife.

345
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:34,078
Otherwise,
we're just being bought.

346
00:15:34,112 --> 00:15:36,112
It's--it's like the--

347
00:15:36,146 --> 00:15:38,513
Look, Ree.

348
00:15:38,546 --> 00:15:40,713
Think before you speak.

349
00:15:40,747 --> 00:15:41,814
[sighs]

350
00:15:41,847 --> 00:15:43,547
(Jean-Baptiste)
What made you think

351
00:15:43,582 --> 00:15:45,382
things would be
different with us?

352
00:15:45,415 --> 00:15:46,650
[door shuts]

353
00:15:46,682 --> 00:15:49,983
(Pouponne)
Jean-Baptiste,
you made a promise to me.

354
00:15:50,017 --> 00:15:51,883
Was I naive
to believe in you?

355
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:53,385
And I've
kept my word.

356
00:15:53,418 --> 00:15:55,551
I help you raise the girls.

357
00:15:55,585 --> 00:15:56,985
Cécilia is taken care of,

358
00:15:57,019 --> 00:15:59,419
and now Henriette
is well-placed too.

359
00:15:59,452 --> 00:16:00,753
And me, Jean.

360
00:16:00,786 --> 00:16:02,854
Me!

361
00:16:02,887 --> 00:16:04,954
I must produce
legitimate heirs.

362
00:16:04,987 --> 00:16:06,355
You knew that.

363
00:16:06,388 --> 00:16:09,023
It is something I must do!

364
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:18,759
You will be
ravishing.

365
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:21,726
Every man there
will hunger after you,

366

00:46:15,495 --> 00:46:19,931
With abandoned slaves.

913
00:46:21,565 --> 00:46:26,365
What they're doing
is so clearly God's work,

914
00:46:26,399 --> 00:46:30,900
and we may not be able
to protect them.

915
00:46:33,668 --> 00:46:36,101
Oh; oh, no,
not this one too.

916
00:46:36,135 --> 00:46:38,136
You can't give away
your ball gown.

917
00:46:38,169 --> 00:46:39,469
That one
more than any other.

918
00:46:39,503 --> 00:46:42,904
No; I'll keep it.

919
00:46:42,937 --> 00:46:45,905
You've been speaking
with Betsie about freedom.

920
00:46:45,938 --> 00:46:47,438
You're giving away
all your clothes,

921
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,005
and next will be
this cottage,

922
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:50,639
and where will that
leave me and my children?

923
00:46:50,673 --> 00:46:53,041
There is no worry.
God will care for us.

924
00:46:53,073 --> 00:46:54,074
And Maman?

925
00:46:56,975 --> 00:46:57,975
We'll pray for her.

926
00:46:59,675 --> 00:47:03,577
Everything Samuel left to the
children--our children--

927
00:47:03,610 --> 00:47:06,477
will be given
to his white family.

928
00:47:06,511 --> 00:47:08,911
Is that how God
answers your prayers?

929
00:47:15,013 --> 00:47:17,514
After I have this baby,

930
00:47:17,547 --> 00:47:19,981
it would seem that I will
have to attend a ball

931
00:47:20,015 --> 00:47:23,015
because I will need to find
someone to take care of us.

932
00:47:23,049 --> 00:47:27,917
I hope I look as bewitching
as you were when I wear green.

933
00:47:30,484 --> 00:47:32,352
(woman)
Are we taking
all this, ma'am?

934
00:47:32,384 --> 00:47:34,053
And this one too?

935
00:47:34,086 --> 00:47:35,053
Thank you, ma'am.

936
00:47:35,086 --> 00:47:36,119
Thank you.

937
00:47:36,154 --> 00:47:37,620
[rapping]

938
00:47:40,054 --> 00:47:41,589
[rapping]

939
00:47:43,722 --> 00:47:45,156
I came
as soon as I heard.

940
00:47:45,189 --> 00:47:47,390
It's bad, miss.

941
00:48:02,727 --> 00:48:05,628
She came too soon.

942
00:48:05,662 --> 00:48:07,128
Gonna die
here in my arms,

943
00:48:07,163 --> 00:48:09,063
and that'll be
the end of this.

944
00:48:10,364 --> 00:48:12,564
I give up on your God.

945
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:13,965
(Simone)
Papa?

946
00:48:13,998 --> 00:48:14,965
Is she here?

947
00:48:14,998 --> 00:48:16,332
Ask her.

948
00:48:16,365 --> 00:48:17,565
I don't want
none of this.

949
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:21,133
Baptize my baby
before she die.

950
00:48:21,166 --> 00:48:24,667
I can't baptize the child.

951
00:48:24,701 --> 00:48:26,235
I'll send
for Father Rousselon.

952
00:48:26,268 --> 00:48:29,336
(woman)
But she might die
before then.

953
00:48:29,369 --> 00:48:32,971
There won't be time.

954
00:48:33,003 --> 00:48:34,071
Please, sister.

955
00:48:36,005 --> 00:48:37,105
[whispers]
Please.

956
00:48:53,309 --> 00:48:55,177
Heavenly Father,

957
00:48:55,210 --> 00:48:57,177
bless this water
with Your Spirit,

958
00:48:57,211 --> 00:48:59,945
and make it holy.

959
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:02,179
What name
do you give this child?

960
00:49:02,212 --> 00:49:04,946
Henriette.

961
00:49:09,748 --> 00:49:12,314
(Henriette)
Henriette,

962
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:15,682
I baptize you
in the name of the Father

963
00:49:15,717 --> 00:49:17,617
and of the Son

964
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:20,252
and of the Holy Ghost.

965
00:49:22,719 --> 00:49:26,386
(Simone)
She's safe now.

966
00:49:37,689 --> 00:49:39,357
[baby hiccups]

967
00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:41,291
(Gerard)
The baby has
a chance to survive.

968
00:49:41,323 --> 00:49:42,524
You did the right thing.

969
00:49:42,558 --> 00:49:45,359
(Henriette)
There wasn't time
to ask for permission,

970
00:49:45,392 --> 00:49:46,525
was there?

971
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:48,360
And what if my prayers
don't work?

972
00:49:48,392 --> 00:49:50,193
No, no, it was right.

973
00:49:50,227 --> 00:49:52,326
You changed the world
for them tonight.

974
00:49:52,361 --> 00:49:54,061
Oh, Gerard, I felt it.

975
00:49:54,095 --> 00:49:56,029
I felt it.
I really did.

976
00:49:56,061 --> 00:49:58,696
You changed
the world for me.

977
00:50:01,063 --> 00:50:04,131
Do you know how much?

978
00:50:04,163 --> 00:50:08,465
You make me feel hope.

979
00:50:08,499 --> 00:50:12,567
You make me feel like
I can make a difference.

980
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:15,568
Henriette,

981
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:19,135
will you come with me
to meet my parents?

982
00:50:20,736 --> 00:50:22,203
Yes.

983
00:50:22,236 --> 00:50:27,137
Then we can be
together forever?

984
00:50:27,171 --> 00:50:30,472
[giggles]
Yes.

985
00:50:33,172 --> 00:50:36,040
[horse whinnies]

986
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:50,111
Oh, vous êtes
très belle.

987
00:50:50,145 --> 00:50:52,312
Cécilia let me
borrow her dress.

988
00:50:52,345 --> 00:50:56,013
They are going
to love you.

989
00:51:03,582 --> 00:51:05,683
Allez.

990
00:51:11,584 --> 00:51:15,052
[thunder rolls]

991
00:51:17,786 --> 00:51:21,054
[goats bleating, dogs barking]

992
00:51:21,087 --> 00:51:22,421
(man)
Whoa.

993
00:51:22,453 --> 00:51:24,721
Get out of the way!

994
00:51:24,755 --> 00:51:25,756
Pardon me?

995
00:51:25,788 --> 00:51:27,756
Move!

996
00:51:27,788 --> 00:51:29,722
What?

997
00:51:29,757 --> 00:51:31,957
[animal noises]

998
00:51:36,791 --> 00:51:39,026
(woman)
Any other
people here?

999
00:51:39,059 --> 00:51:42,427
(man)
I have
some paying customers.

1000
00:51:42,459 --> 00:51:45,094
Your people are so dedicated
to making us feel inferior.

1001
00:51:45,128 --> 00:51:47,562
Is this our day, then:

1002
00:51:47,595 --> 00:51:52,130
you poking me with daggers,
me hanging my head?

1003
00:51:52,163 --> 00:51:55,463
If a man insults me,

1004
00:51:55,498 --> 00:51:57,464
there is no question
of what I would do.

1005
00:51:57,498 --> 00:51:59,765
I would oil my pistols
and meet him at Twin Oaks.

1006
00:51:59,799 --> 00:52:01,466
I know how to be brave
for that.

1007
00:52:01,499 --> 00:52:04,134
But this--it is like
walking in a fog.

1008
00:52:04,166 --> 00:52:06,034
There are no boundaries.

1009
00:52:06,067 --> 00:52:09,734
The look on their faces--
I wanted to hide from it.

1010
00:52:09,769 --> 00:52:12,269
Henriette,

1011
00:52:12,303 --> 00:52:17,037
I do not know
how to be brave for this.

1012
00:52:17,071 --> 00:52:18,537
I love you.

1013
00:52:18,571 --> 00:52:22,371
I'm sorry.

1014
00:52:22,406 --> 00:52:24,372
We'll both have to learn.

1015
00:52:26,106 --> 00:52:28,340
I'll depend on you
for strength in it.

1016
00:52:28,374 --> 00:52:31,541
Perhaps we should
spend some time alone

1017
00:52:31,575 --> 00:52:33,108
before we fight more ghosts.

1018
00:52:33,143 --> 00:52:35,043
Oh, but I put
my dress on,

1019
00:52:35,076 --> 00:52:38,077
and I did my hair
to meet your maman.

1020
00:52:38,110 --> 00:52:40,344
She's expecting us
for dinner.

1021
00:52:40,377 --> 00:52:42,245
Henriette.

1022
00:52:42,278 --> 00:52:43,711
I am afraid.

1023
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:47,513
You did tell them.

1024
00:52:51,147 --> 00:52:52,682
And they...

1025
00:52:52,714 --> 00:52:57,682
They said, um...they would
treat you with kindness.

1026
00:52:57,716 --> 00:52:59,684
Pity.

1027
00:52:59,716 --> 00:53:01,483
Respect.

1028
00:53:01,517 --> 00:53:03,784
Respect for you.

1029
00:53:03,818 --> 00:53:05,751
Their stomachs will turn
at the sight of me.

1030
00:53:05,786 --> 00:53:08,086
Then they'll wash their hands
twice before I'm gone.

1031
00:53:08,118 --> 00:53:10,020
I cannot protect you
from that.

1032
00:53:10,053 --> 00:53:12,254
I don't want to be protected.

1033
00:53:12,287 --> 00:53:14,154
I want to be free of it.

1034
00:53:15,788 --> 00:53:18,055
I'm sorry.

1035
00:53:18,089 --> 00:53:21,056
You don't understand.
You can't.

1036
00:53:21,090 --> 00:53:23,489
Gerard, I do believe
you love me.

1037
00:53:23,524 --> 00:53:26,124
But you can't make me
disappear into your world.

1038
00:53:30,459 --> 00:53:33,226
Henriette, please, no.

1039
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:35,327
Let me take you back.

1040
00:53:47,464 --> 00:53:49,764
Henriette?

1041
00:53:49,799 --> 00:53:52,332
I didn't recognize you.

1042
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:57,367
I used to hear
the angels sing.

1043
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:00,268
I can't hear them anymore.

1044
00:54:00,301 --> 00:54:03,135
They're still here.

1045
00:54:03,169 --> 00:54:06,203
I'll see you
at the funeral.

1046
00:54:06,236 --> 00:54:09,805
What funeral?

1047
00:54:09,837 --> 00:54:11,272
You haven't heard,
then?

1048
00:54:13,138 --> 00:54:15,039
Heard what?

1049
00:54:15,073 --> 00:54:18,407
Simone hemorrhaged
in the night.

1050
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:20,774
She never woke up.

1051
00:54:22,374 --> 00:54:25,575
[crying]

1052
00:54:25,608 --> 00:54:28,109
They found her baby
sleeping peacefully beside her.

1053
00:54:28,143 --> 00:54:30,377
I heard what you did.

1054
00:54:30,410 --> 00:54:35,379
I'm sure
it gave her peace.

1055
00:54:50,850 --> 00:54:54,651
[bell clanging]

1056
00:54:54,684 --> 00:54:58,186
[woman crying]

1057
00:55:06,655 --> 00:55:09,489
(Henriette)
Is God so wrathful?

1058
00:55:09,521 --> 00:55:12,223
Suffering
on top of suffering,

1059
00:55:12,256 --> 00:55:14,590
with no lesson,
no reason?

1060
00:55:14,623 --> 00:55:17,057
I don't understand,
Father.

1061
00:55:17,092 --> 00:55:18,091
Bonjour,
 sister.

1062
00:55:18,125 --> 00:55:19,592
Bonjour.

1063
00:55:19,625 --> 00:55:23,093
I've sought;
I've prayed.

1064
00:55:23,126 --> 00:55:25,160
I still do not understand.

1065
00:55:25,194 --> 00:55:26,361
Bonjour,
 sister.

1066
00:55:26,393 --> 00:55:27,794
[whispers]
Bonjour.

1067
00:55:27,828 --> 00:55:30,128
Draw on your faith.

1068
00:55:30,161 --> 00:55:33,062
We're not meant to grasp
everything at once.

1069
00:55:33,096 --> 00:55:34,363
[man crying]

1070
00:55:34,396 --> 00:55:36,363
That answer
does not satisfy me.

1071
00:55:36,397 --> 00:55:38,097
I need to know why.

1072
00:55:38,131 --> 00:55:39,298
I don't understand.

1073
00:55:39,331 --> 00:55:40,631
He called you
"sister."

1074
00:55:40,665 --> 00:55:42,065
They all do.

1075
00:55:42,098 --> 00:55:44,300
Haven't you heard
them?

1076
00:55:44,332 --> 00:55:45,500
You've touched them,

1077
00:55:45,532 --> 00:55:47,500
and so you've become
a sister of the Lord.

1078
00:55:47,533 --> 00:55:49,101
I didn't ask for it.

1079
00:55:49,134 --> 00:55:52,068
No; you say God hasn't
helped the suffering,

1080
00:55:52,102 --> 00:55:53,468
but He has.

1081
00:55:53,502 --> 00:55:55,169
He gave them you.

1082
00:55:55,203 --> 00:55:57,170
But-I-I can't--

1083
00:55:57,203 --> 00:55:59,704
Do you remember the night
you came to Him?

1084
00:55:59,737 --> 00:56:01,371
You were abandoned,

1085
00:56:01,405 --> 00:56:04,072
and yet you knew
where to come.

1086
00:56:04,105 --> 00:56:07,106
You knew the solace
it could bring others.

1087
00:56:09,239 --> 00:56:12,108
What does God want
from me?

1088
00:56:24,511 --> 00:56:26,711
Come on, sister.

1089
00:56:37,582 --> 00:56:39,316
[knocks once]

1090
00:56:42,217 --> 00:56:45,217
You cannot give me
a second chance?

1091
00:56:46,851 --> 00:56:49,119
Let's begin
at the beginning.

1092
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:51,185
Why were you
at the ball that night?

1093
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:53,720
I was there looking
for you, Henriette.

1094
00:56:53,754 --> 00:56:55,321
To be your concubine?

1095
00:56:55,353 --> 00:56:56,587
No.

1096
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:58,388
I want to be able
to believe you always.

1097
00:56:58,421 --> 00:57:01,555
Then believe me.

1098
00:57:01,589 --> 00:57:03,390
Because every time
I visit my mother

1099
00:57:03,423 --> 00:57:04,656
and see how she was destroyed

1100
00:57:04,690 --> 00:57:06,790
because she loved a man
from a different world--

1101
00:57:06,824 --> 00:57:07,791
I am not
your father.

1102
00:57:07,823 --> 00:57:10,657
I could not abandon you.

1103
00:57:10,692 --> 00:57:14,826
If I have to choose
between you and my world--

1104
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:20,094
my parents, even--
I'd choose you.

1105
00:57:22,229 --> 00:57:25,229
We can have a real life
in France,

1106
00:57:25,263 --> 00:57:28,196
a real marriage.

1107
00:57:28,230 --> 00:57:29,530
We can be happy.

1108
00:57:29,563 --> 00:57:31,131
Happy.

1109
00:57:31,164 --> 00:57:33,165
[whispering]
Yes,
ma chère.

1110
00:57:33,198 --> 00:57:35,632
I will protect you.

1111
00:57:35,665 --> 00:57:39,366
People will look at us
and shake their heads

1112
00:57:39,401 --> 00:57:45,136
and wish that
they'd married for love.

1113
00:57:45,168 --> 00:57:48,803
[whispering]
We will change the world.

1114
00:58:04,608 --> 00:58:06,408
Here.

1115
00:58:06,442 --> 00:58:08,342
You don't look
very well.

1116
00:58:08,375 --> 00:58:09,475
Oh, I'm just tired.

1117
00:58:09,510 --> 00:58:11,343
Perhaps we should
delay the departure.

1118
00:58:11,377 --> 00:58:12,411
No, I'm fine,
I'm fine.

1119
00:58:12,443 --> 00:58:13,410
We'll be fine.

1120
00:58:13,444 --> 00:58:16,544
You just enjoy whatever
time you have together.

1121
00:58:16,578 --> 00:58:19,379
[sighs]
To be loved

1122
00:58:19,413 --> 00:58:22,413
and to let
yourself be loved,

1123
00:58:22,447 --> 00:58:24,213
to be touched
so deeply, Célie.

1124
00:58:24,248 --> 00:58:27,114
You told me,
but how could I know?

1125
00:58:27,148 --> 00:58:29,882
You might as well
take some of these dresses.

1126
00:58:29,915 --> 00:58:32,215
They don't fit me
anymore.

1127
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:34,116
[laughing]

1128
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:35,517
Uhh.

1129
00:58:35,551 --> 00:58:37,217
You have nothing
to worry about.

1130
00:58:37,251 --> 00:58:38,451
Gerard has promised

1131
00:58:38,484 --> 00:58:40,452
to take care
of you and Maman.

1132
00:58:40,485 --> 00:58:43,218
He's gonna help you
fight for your inheritance

1133
00:58:43,253 --> 00:58:46,154
that Samuel
wanted you to have.

1134
00:58:46,186 --> 00:58:48,387
Oh, you're so lucky.

1135
00:58:48,421 --> 00:58:49,721
You must write to me

1136
00:58:49,754 --> 00:58:52,356
the moment
you set foot in Paris.

1137
00:58:52,388 --> 00:58:54,189
Write?

1138
00:58:54,222 --> 00:58:55,890
You'll visit.

1139
00:58:55,923 --> 00:58:59,491
We expect you
at the wedding.

1140
00:58:59,524 --> 00:59:00,857
Oh,

1141
00:59:00,892 --> 00:59:05,325
Gerard's gonna complain
about my rocks,

1142
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:06,693
my books.

1143
00:59:06,726 --> 00:59:10,127
He's always--

1144
00:59:10,161 --> 00:59:12,429
Célie?

1145
00:59:12,461 --> 00:59:15,495
Célie.

1146
00:59:21,931 --> 00:59:22,898
[tapping at door]

1147
00:59:22,931 --> 00:59:24,165
(Gerard)
Henriette,

1148
00:59:24,198 --> 00:59:26,899
look what I have.

1149
00:59:26,932 --> 00:59:28,666
(Henriette)
It's Cecelia.

1150
00:59:28,699 --> 00:59:30,367
Her fever's very high.

1151
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,467
They say
Creoles don't get it,

1152
00:59:32,501 --> 00:59:33,801
but she got it.

1153
00:59:33,835 --> 00:59:36,234
There's an outbreak
of yellow fever.

1154
00:59:36,269 --> 00:59:38,235
It can affect anyone.

1155
00:59:38,269 --> 00:59:40,169
My medical bag is here.

1156
00:59:40,203 --> 00:59:41,503
Gerard, I--

1157
00:59:41,537 --> 00:59:44,371
I-I know.

1158
00:59:46,871 --> 00:59:47,872
I'm sorry.

1159
00:59:47,905 --> 00:59:50,906
Me too.

1160
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:53,374
It would be nice to have
a conversation between us

1161
00:59:53,406 --> 00:59:57,141
when one of us does not
have to say how sorry we are.

1162
01:00:08,912 --> 01:00:11,879
[Henriette praying softly]
The Lord is with thee.

1163
01:00:11,913 --> 01:00:16,147
[whispering]

1164
01:00:16,181 --> 01:00:18,281
Quinine solution
is very effective in the--

1165
01:00:18,314 --> 01:00:20,148
The Lord is with thee.

1166
01:00:20,182 --> 01:00:23,516
Blessed art thou
amongst women.

1167
01:00:23,549 --> 01:00:27,451
Blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

1168
01:00:27,484 --> 01:00:30,284
Holy Mary,
mother of God,

1169
01:00:30,318 --> 01:00:33,686
pray for us sinners now
and at the hour of our death.

1170
01:00:33,718 --> 01:00:35,554
Amen.

1171
01:00:41,555 --> 01:00:45,822
[church bells pealing]

1172
01:00:48,857 --> 01:00:51,357
You gonna pray
for me, sister?

1173
01:00:51,391 --> 01:00:52,591
With all my heart.

1174
01:00:53,591 --> 01:00:55,358
How is Célie?

1175
01:00:55,392 --> 01:00:57,326
The fever broke
just an hour ago.

1176
01:00:57,358 --> 01:00:59,260
Ah, the quinine
mixture, it was--

1177
01:00:59,293 --> 01:01:01,727
I was trying
something new.

1178
01:01:01,761 --> 01:01:04,494
The quinine had
little to do with it.

1179
01:01:04,528 --> 01:01:07,796
But it was the medicine
that saved her.

1180
01:01:09,830 --> 01:01:12,263
How many times have you given
medicine to patients

1181
01:01:12,297 --> 01:01:13,263
and lost them?

1182
01:01:13,298 --> 01:01:14,665
But without it?

1183
01:01:14,698 --> 01:01:16,865
Prayer saved her.

1184
01:01:16,899 --> 01:01:18,166
How can you
believe that?

1185
01:01:18,199 --> 01:01:19,333
Because it's true.

1186
01:01:19,365 --> 01:01:21,300
[man coughing]

1187
01:01:21,333 --> 01:01:23,201
Your sister is well.

1188
01:01:23,233 --> 01:01:24,768
I do not care why.

1189
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:26,201
It does not matter why.

1190
01:01:26,235 --> 01:01:27,401
This is wonderful,

1191
01:01:27,435 --> 01:01:29,469
and we can begin
to plan again.

1192
01:01:29,502 --> 01:01:31,336
Henriette,

1193
01:01:31,369 --> 01:01:33,670
do not turn your back
on us.

1194
01:01:33,704 --> 01:01:35,270
Not now.

1195
01:01:35,304 --> 01:01:36,704
I'm supposed to be here.

1196
01:01:36,737 --> 01:01:39,305
My work is here.

1197
01:01:39,339 --> 01:01:40,805
But we can do
even more in France.

1198
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:43,773
We can work openly,
perhaps build a hospital.

1199
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:45,273
And you would not
be accused

1200
01:01:45,307 --> 01:01:46,475
of corrupting
the slaves.

1201
01:01:46,507 --> 01:01:48,908
Because there are
no slaves.

1202
01:01:48,942 --> 01:01:51,242
We can heal
bodies and spirits.

1203
01:01:51,275 --> 01:01:54,810
I prayed
for the answers, Gerard.

1204
01:01:54,843 --> 01:01:59,444
I found out
what God wants from me.

1205
01:01:59,478 --> 01:02:01,245
God has been calling me
for a long time,

1206
01:02:01,278 --> 01:02:02,546
and I can't deny it.

1207
01:02:02,579 --> 01:02:06,714
I feel God is working
through me.

1208
01:02:13,748 --> 01:02:18,617
You said you wanted
an ordinary life,

1209
01:02:18,650 --> 01:02:20,218
a life with me.

1210
01:02:20,251 --> 01:02:23,819
[whispers]
I know.

1211
01:02:23,852 --> 01:02:26,553
We can't have it.

1212
01:02:26,586 --> 01:02:29,920
And so now there is
nothing for me?

1213
01:02:29,954 --> 01:02:32,222
Here,

1214
01:02:32,254 --> 01:02:33,888
we cannot even marry.

1215
01:02:37,423 --> 01:02:41,190
What do you want from me?

1216
01:02:52,595 --> 01:02:53,561
Welcome.

1217
01:02:53,594 --> 01:02:55,528
Thank you, sister.

1218
01:02:57,595 --> 01:02:59,529
These women
are not sisters.

1219
01:03:00,597 --> 01:03:02,930
You must not
call them that.

1220
01:03:02,964 --> 01:03:06,165
You deceive this parish
with those costumes.

1221
01:03:08,465 --> 01:03:11,233
Thank you, sister.

1222
01:03:13,967 --> 01:03:15,300
I'm sorry,
but this time,

1223
01:03:15,334 --> 01:03:16,801
you'll have to stop
wearing them.

1224
01:03:16,835 --> 01:03:18,301
Well, what am I to wear?

1225
01:03:18,335 --> 01:03:19,869
I've given
everything away.

1226
01:03:19,902 --> 01:03:21,369
[sighs]
Henriette.

1227
01:03:21,402 --> 01:03:24,270
[sighs]
Do you know what I see
when I pray?

1228
01:03:24,303 --> 01:03:26,872
I see the Virgin Mary,
but her skin is brown.

1229
01:03:26,904 --> 01:03:28,505
The slaves in
the
gens de couleur

1230
01:03:28,538 --> 01:03:30,238
need to know that
God is their God too,

1231
01:03:30,272 --> 01:03:32,905
and we can't
just tell them.

1232
01:03:32,939 --> 01:03:36,241
Color needs to be seen
with their own eyes.

1233
01:03:36,273 --> 01:03:37,241
[sighs]

1234
01:03:37,274 --> 01:03:39,841
God wants black faces
working in his church.

1235
01:03:39,875 --> 01:03:40,842
Henriette,

1236
01:03:40,875 --> 01:03:45,409
there are forces against you,
powerful people

1237
01:03:45,443 --> 01:03:47,576
who can ruin everything
we've accomplished.

1238
01:03:47,611 --> 01:03:49,911
We need to go slow.

1239
01:03:49,944 --> 01:03:50,777
Are we intended

1240
01:03:50,812 --> 01:03:53,246
to be frightened
into submission?

1241
01:03:53,278 --> 01:03:56,279
Marie?

1242
01:03:56,313 --> 01:03:58,248
You're crying.

1243
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:01,314
The bishop has just
banished me from the parish.

1244
01:04:01,348 --> 01:04:02,848
Banished?

1245
01:04:02,882 --> 01:04:04,315
Yes, I'm being sent upriver

1246
01:04:04,349 --> 01:04:06,283
to teach wealthy children
on a plantation.

1247
01:04:06,315 --> 01:04:08,250
(Rousselon)
The wardens
have pointed out

1248
01:04:08,283 --> 01:04:09,183
that it's become illegal

1249
01:04:09,216 --> 01:04:11,217
for integrated groups
to work together.

1250
01:04:11,251 --> 01:04:13,252
(Henriette)
And you knew about this?

1251
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:19,220
The bishop is forced
to disband you.

1252
01:04:19,253 --> 01:04:22,220
So he's decided to play
on the side of the masters.

1253
01:04:23,721 --> 01:04:26,321
They will also close
the parish schools,

1254
01:04:26,356 --> 01:04:28,522
since slave children
are being taught with whites.

1255
01:04:29,723 --> 01:04:31,924
I am next on their list.

1256
01:04:33,625 --> 01:04:35,625
This has got to stop.

1257
01:04:38,926 --> 01:04:42,460
[church bells pealing]

1258
01:04:47,362 --> 01:04:50,328
(Blanc)
As I see by your costume,

1259
01:04:50,363 --> 01:04:54,831
obedience is not a virtue
you put much store by.

1260
01:04:54,863 --> 01:04:56,564
Please, Your Excellence,

1261
01:04:56,597 --> 01:04:59,598
just hear an idea?

1262
01:04:59,632 --> 01:05:02,866
There's a house.

1263
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:06,734
My friends and I have
just enough money to buy it.

1264
01:05:06,767 --> 01:05:09,968
With donations,
there's a building next door

1265
01:05:10,002 --> 01:05:13,235
that we can fix up
and turn into a mother house.

1266
01:05:13,270 --> 01:05:17,370
You mean to build
your own church now,

1267
01:05:17,404 --> 01:05:20,305
complete with a convent?

1268
01:05:20,338 --> 01:05:23,306
And we need you
to bless the endeavor.

1269
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:35,342
As there are no colored
religious orders,

1270
01:05:35,376 --> 01:05:39,310
I would be blessing
only an act of your pride.

1271
01:05:41,011 --> 01:05:42,611
But you've seen
their faces,

1272
01:05:42,645 --> 01:05:45,279
those hungry souls
that worship
in our church.

1273
01:05:45,312 --> 01:05:47,579
You cannot say
you are not moved.

1274
01:05:47,613 --> 01:05:49,980
Do you expect the Catholic
Church of Louisiana

1275
01:05:50,013 --> 01:05:52,281
to challenge the state?

1276
01:05:52,314 --> 01:05:55,348
To start a fire
that could sweep away

1277
01:05:55,382 --> 01:05:57,982
what they've left
of their freedom?

1278
01:05:58,016 --> 01:06:00,983
But the reward would be
greater than the risk.

1279
01:06:01,017 --> 01:06:04,450
Even if I believed
you should be nuns,

1280
01:06:04,485 --> 01:06:07,319
it can take years
to receive
Rome's consideration,

1281
01:06:07,351 --> 01:06:09,286
and then the answer
could well be no.

1282
01:06:09,319 --> 01:06:11,520
I cannot see
how I can help you.

1283
01:06:11,554 --> 01:06:15,555
Perhaps you don't need
to appear to be helping us.

1284
01:06:21,290 --> 01:06:24,257
This church serves
a changing community.

1285
01:06:24,290 --> 01:06:26,891
Why, that sounds
positively threatenin'.

1286
01:06:28,525 --> 01:06:32,359
I understand you have moved
to block my appointment

1287
01:06:32,393 --> 01:06:34,661
of Father Rousselon
to the cathedral.

1288
01:06:34,694 --> 01:06:39,328
We will not continue
to tolerate interference

1289
01:06:39,361 --> 01:06:40,563
in church business.

1290
01:06:40,595 --> 01:06:43,829
I understand you filed
a lawsuit against us.

1291
01:06:43,863 --> 01:06:46,297
Rather extreme reaction.

1292
01:06:46,330 --> 01:06:48,298
I thought you should know

1293
01:06:48,331 --> 01:06:51,399
I also am connected with
the courts down in the Delta,

1294
01:06:51,431 --> 01:06:54,332
and I can assure you
money will win out

1295
01:06:54,366 --> 01:06:55,934
in the end.

1296
01:06:55,966 --> 01:06:57,700
And I can assure you

1297
01:06:57,734 --> 01:07:00,768
the rape of a child
is considered a sin,

1298
01:07:00,801 --> 01:07:03,303
even in the Delta.

1299
01:07:04,436 --> 01:07:07,636
There are no secrets
in this parish.

1300
01:07:07,670 --> 01:07:10,905
What about baptizing
a half-breed bastard child

1301
01:07:10,938 --> 01:07:11,971
outside the church?

1302
01:07:12,005 --> 01:07:17,906
A warden of the church
should be above reproach,

1303
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:22,541
especially one married to
someone as pious as your wife.

1304
01:07:22,575 --> 01:07:26,576
But, as I said,

1305
01:07:26,609 --> 01:07:30,010
the church is here
to serve the whole community.

1306
01:07:31,510 --> 01:07:33,611
May I suggest instead

1307
01:07:33,644 --> 01:07:36,512
we let them build
a place of their own?

1308
01:07:36,545 --> 01:07:38,846
The coloreds?

1309
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:41,314
They'll never do it.

1310
01:07:41,347 --> 01:07:43,814
But we must
let them build it.

1311
01:07:43,847 --> 01:07:47,549
And if they fail,
they fail on their own terms,

1312
01:07:47,582 --> 01:07:49,316
'cause if they don't,

1313
01:07:49,349 --> 01:07:51,650
there's no tellin'
what trouble they'll cause,

1314
01:07:51,683 --> 01:07:53,450
Your Excellence.

01:08:05,054 --> 01:08:07,287
You're so thin.

1318
01:08:07,322 --> 01:08:09,055
I thought you promised me
that you would eat.

1319
01:08:09,088 --> 01:08:12,855
And you...
you look like a nun.

1320
01:08:12,890 --> 01:08:16,258
You should wear
more color.

1321

1322
01:08:20,426 --> 01:08:23,960

with your eyes.

Oh. Ohh.

at the ball.

1325
01:08:28,927 --> 01:08:32,596

with another woman

1326

01:08:47,867 --> 01:08:51,300
Ohh.

[sobbing]

1331
01:09:10,873 --> 01:09:13,041
(Julie)
It's hard to imagine this
as a convent.

1332
01:09:13,074 --> 01:09:14,542
At this rate,
it'll take us years

1333
01:09:14,574 --> 01:09:16,941
to raise enough money
to fix it up.

1334
01:09:16,976 --> 01:09:19,077
We don't have
years to waste.

1335
01:09:19,109 --> 01:09:22,811
To be an effective order,
we need a place to live,

1336
01:09:22,844 --> 01:09:25,712
an infirmary
properly equipped, a school.

1337
01:09:25,745 --> 01:09:27,745
What about your house?

1338
01:09:27,778 --> 01:09:30,946
Sell my house?

1339
01:09:30,980 --> 01:09:33,013
The cottage isn't
mine to sell.

1340
01:09:33,047 --> 01:09:35,081
Cecelia needs it
to raise a family.

1341
01:09:35,114 --> 01:09:37,449
My parents worked
themselves to death

1342
01:09:37,481 --> 01:09:40,315
to leave that place to me.

1343
01:09:40,350 --> 01:09:43,084
Am I now to consider
giving all that up?

1344
01:09:43,116 --> 01:09:46,317
In the name of God.

1345
01:09:46,351 --> 01:09:47,985
I think your parents
would be proud

1346
01:09:48,018 --> 01:09:52,586
to know their legacy is being
used to serve the community.

1347
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:56,621
Julie, we need to sever
all of our attachments.

1348
01:09:56,654 --> 01:09:58,355
And Gerard?

1349
01:09:58,388 --> 01:10:00,788
Were you able to say
good-bye so easily?

1350
01:10:00,822 --> 01:10:02,755
Good-bye?

1351
01:10:05,023 --> 01:10:07,024
I thought you knew.

1352
01:10:08,358 --> 01:10:10,958
He's going
back to France, Ree,

1353
01:10:10,992 --> 01:10:13,993

1354
01:10:41,468 --> 01:10:42,900
Thank you.

1355
01:10:42,935 --> 01:10:44,468
For what?

1356
01:10:44,502 --> 01:10:45,936
For coming.

1357
01:10:45,968 --> 01:10:47,802
I wasn't sure you would.

1358
01:10:50,637 --> 01:10:54,405
I've been offered a post
at a hospital in Nice,

1359
01:10:54,437 --> 01:10:55,639
a teaching hospital,

1360
01:10:55,672 --> 01:10:57,905
quite experimental.

1361
01:10:57,939 --> 01:10:59,539
You'll make
a wonderful teacher.

1362
01:11:00,539 --> 01:11:03,907
Henriette, why am I here?

1363
01:11:05,642 --> 01:11:07,541
Uh, my reason...

1364
01:11:08,676 --> 01:11:10,943
our church has run
out of building funds.

1365
01:11:10,976 --> 01:11:12,410
Is that all I am to you?

1366
01:11:12,443 --> 01:11:13,343
I--no--

1367
01:11:13,378 --> 01:11:16,045
You might as well
have stayed at the ball.

1368
01:11:17,612 --> 01:11:19,912
I apologize.

1369
01:11:19,945 --> 01:11:22,647
That was uncalled for.

1370
01:11:24,114 --> 01:11:26,381
The truth is, I wanted
to know whether you still--

1371
01:11:26,414 --> 01:11:30,582
I will always love you.

1372
01:11:32,850 --> 01:11:36,917
My parents have cut me off

1373
01:11:36,951 --> 01:11:38,585
for refusing to marry

1374
01:11:38,617 --> 01:11:41,051
the suitable woman
they have found.

1375
01:11:41,085 --> 01:11:44,653
A year ago, I might have,

1376
01:11:44,686 --> 01:11:47,121
but you changed me.

1377
01:11:47,153 --> 01:11:53,355
So...now we both
work for the poor,

1378
01:11:53,389 --> 01:11:57,090
alone, apart.

1379
01:11:57,123 --> 01:11:58,757
Gerard, I'm sorry.

1380
01:11:58,791 --> 01:12:00,358
Sorry.

1381
01:12:00,391 --> 01:12:03,358
Is that why God
made us twin souls,

1382
01:12:03,392 --> 01:12:06,526
so we could be
so unhappy?

1383

01:27:20,766 --> 01:27:22,934
Let me look and see

1626
01:27:22,967 --> 01:27:26,200
what's in the coffers
of the diocese.

1627
01:27:26,235 --> 01:27:29,335
Oh, thank you,
Your Excellence.

1628
01:27:30,735 --> 01:27:34,337
Thank you, my child.

1629
01:27:42,406 --> 01:27:43,372
No, wait.

1630
01:27:43,407 --> 01:27:44,440
Let it be.

1631
01:27:44,472 --> 01:27:50,142
It will give everyone
something to think about.

1632
01:28:07,446 --> 01:28:08,747
Sister.

1633
01:28:11,148 --> 01:28:13,382
Master's wife freed us
this mornin'.

1634
01:28:13,415 --> 01:28:14,783
She paid the fee
for all of us:

1635
01:28:14,815 --> 01:28:15,915
the entire household

1636
01:28:15,950 --> 01:28:16,950
and the field slaves.

1637
01:28:16,983 --> 01:28:19,283
Oh, God bless her.

1638
01:28:19,318 --> 01:28:22,751
I always dreamt of this day.

1639
01:28:22,785 --> 01:28:24,785
I figured
my first day of freedom,

1640
01:28:24,819 --> 01:28:26,852
I was gonna sleep
till I wake up.

1641
01:28:26,886 --> 01:28:30,921
Then I was gonna roll over
and go back to sleep again.

1642
01:28:30,954 --> 01:28:32,188
[chuckles]

1643
01:28:32,220 --> 01:28:34,287
'Stead, I got my life
packed up,

1644
01:28:34,322 --> 01:28:37,089
and I'm gonna be
on a riverboat
by sundown,

1645
01:28:37,122 --> 01:28:39,390
and that feels mighty fine.

1646
01:28:39,423 --> 01:28:41,190
God bless you.

1647
01:28:41,223 --> 01:28:43,391
Good-bye, Sister.

1648
01:28:43,424 --> 01:28:46,191
And thank you
for everything.

1649
01:29:03,331 --> 01:29:05,663
[children shouting]

1650
01:29:05,698 --> 01:29:08,798
[ringing]

1651
01:29:08,832 --> 01:29:13,434
(Williams)
Henriette's community received
a formal religious rule of life,

1652
01:29:13,466 --> 01:29:16,435
adopted a habit,
and pronounced their vows.

1653
01:29:16,467 --> 01:29:18,834
They bought
the old Orleans ballroom

1654
01:29:18,868 --> 01:29:20,902
and converted it
into a sanctuary

1655
01:29:20,935 --> 01:29:23,403
for education and the needy.

1656
01:29:23,436 --> 01:29:26,704
Today, they continue to service
the poor, the sick,

1657
01:29:26,737 --> 01:29:28,972
and the illiterate.
