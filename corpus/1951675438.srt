1
00:00:09,651 --> 00:00:11,784
Quiet on the set and we're rolling

2
00:00:11,785 --> 00:00:12,785
Cody Maverick interview take 1

3
00:00:12,786 --> 00:00:13,786
So why are you guys here to interview me?

4
00:00:15,562 --> 00:00:17,318
It's what we do, we're a reality film crew

5
00:00:17,319 --> 00:00:19,802
Should I know some of the questions before we start?

6
00:00:20,346 --> 00:00:20,857
Just so I don't...

7
00:00:20,858 --> 00:00:21,858
No, uhh...they're, they're easy

8
00:00:21,859 --> 00:00:22,859
Okay

9
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:23,860
Could you stand on that box right there please?

10
00:00:23,861 --> 00:00:24,861
Oh, yeah

11
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:31,249
Whoa...Whoa, what is that, what is that sound thing?

12
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:32,250
It's a microphone

13
00:00:32,251 --> 00:00:33,251
What's up man? I'm Cody.

14
00:00:33,252 --> 00:00:34,252
And you're what 14, 15 years old?

15
00:00:35,621 --> 00:00:36,598
uh...17 years of age

16
00:00:38,225 --> 00:00:39,801
And, uh any other skills besides surfing?

17
00:00:40,292 --> 00:00:43,146
Like what? Singing and dancing?

18
00:00:42,303 --> 00:00:44,147
yeah, yeah

19
00:00:44,148 --> 00:00:46,884
[laughs] No, not me man, I just surf.

20
00:00:47,378 --> 00:00:48,153
Loser...

21
00:00:49,877 --> 00:00:51,075
Cut it out Glen, stop man.

22
00:00:51,076 --> 00:00:52,076
You know we're here to make a movie about Cody.

23
00:00:52,077 --> 00:00:53,077
Does he have to be here?

24
00:00:53,078 --> 00:00:54,078
Yeah, it's gonna be great

25
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,551
Can I get in line now to not see it?

26
00:00:58,137 --> 00:01:00,573
Since we're talking about surfing why don't you give us your

27
00:00:59,485 --> 00:01:01,574
thoughts about surfing.

28
00:01:01,575 --> 00:01:04,781
Surfing...Surfing...where do I start?

29
00:01:04,782 --> 00:01:05,782
How about just at the beginning?

30
00:01:07,161 --> 00:01:11,059
Ok, well, uh...so as soon as there was the first wave, right?

31
00:01:13,149 --> 00:01:14,839
There was the first surfer.

32
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:20,281
All they needed was like uh, um, something like a piece of driftwood,

33
00:01:20,282 --> 00:01:21,282
block of ice, or something like that

34
00:01:22,788 --> 00:01:23,888
and then they were off.

35
00:01:25,269 --> 00:01:27,019
And they were hooked man

36
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,020
they were hooked.

37
00:01:31,275 --> 00:01:33,513
Up 'til recent times you had your old dudes

38
00:01:33,932 --> 00:01:35,856
you know, you're hang 6 cats, these old guys

39
00:01:35,857 --> 00:01:38,538
used to lay down with these huge, humongous boards

40
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:45,610
These guys were the pioneers, but nobody saw what surfing could really be.

41
00:01:45,611 --> 00:01:48,230
Until Big Z did it.

42
00:01:48,723 --> 00:01:49,962
Could you tell us who Big Z was?

43
00:01:49,963 --> 00:01:50,963
Who was Big Z?

44
00:01:50,964 --> 00:01:53,885
You're asking the right guy, you got that part...

45
00:01:53,886 --> 00:01:57,200
Big Z is everything, Big Z is surfing

46
00:01:57,201 --> 00:02:01,931
and I mean he's...they invented the ocean for him.

47
00:02:04,774 --> 00:02:07,037
He lived so hard, because he wasn't afraid to live

48
00:02:08,346 --> 00:02:09,583
he wasn't afraid to die.

49
00:02:21,914 --> 00:02:23,756
He came to Antartica when I was just a kid

50
00:02:26,223 --> 00:02:29,107
Man, he just [sighs] he was the biggest thing that ever happened here.

51
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:32,249
Suddenly there he was

52
00:02:33,254 --> 00:02:34,602
just

53
00:02:36,065 --> 00:02:38,731
floating over the water, just hovering, you know, like weightless.

54
00:02:42,922 --> 00:02:45,491
Could have walked up anyone

55
00:02:45,492 --> 00:02:48,760
and he walks right up to me.

56
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:53,792
He gives me this awesome, one of a kind, Big Z necklace

57
00:02:53,793 --> 00:02:58,535
and then he tells me you know kid, never give up,

58
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,703
to find a way, because that's what winners do.

59
00:03:05,384 --> 00:03:06,835
He was the greatest.

60
00:03:09,046 --> 00:03:12,440
Every one looked up to him, respected him, loved him.

61
00:03:12,441 --> 00:03:16,677
And, one day...one day, I'm going to be just like him.

62
00:03:29,957 --> 00:03:32,055
I've been surfing ever since I can remember

63
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:36,140
it's hard to imagine any part of my life when I wasn't surfing.

64
00:03:36,141 --> 00:03:37,141
I want to get out of here,

65
00:03:37,142 --> 00:03:39,774
you know, and this is my ticket out.

66
00:03:39,775 --> 00:03:40,775
I'm really good man,

67
00:03:40,776 --> 00:03:43,063
I'm the best on the island.

68
00:03:43,931 --> 00:03:45,869
I know it sounds cocky saying that

69
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:49,141
but I am...like the best.

70
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,912
Yeah, I was born and raised here in Shiverpool

71
00:03:58,913 --> 00:04:02,791
lived here my whole life.

72
00:04:03,763 --> 00:04:04,828
This is where the sort the fish

73
00:04:05,737 --> 00:04:07,005
it's the dumbest thing I've ever heard of.

74
00:04:07,006 --> 00:04:12,699
But, yeah, I worked there just to kind of pacify my mom a little bit.

75
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,183
Good 'ole Shiverpool [laughs]

76
00:04:15,184 --> 00:04:17,068
this place sucks bro'.

77
00:04:17,069 --> 00:04:19,905
I worked my way up from the sardine pile

78
00:04:19,906 --> 00:04:23,844
then to the mackeral pile...all hard work.

79
00:04:29,134 --> 00:04:32,029
My house...it's down over there, see it right there with the surf boards.

80
00:04:32,737 --> 00:04:36,505
Yeah, I just live here with me, my brother Glen, my Mom.

81
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:39,747
He was a little, teeny small egg,

82
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:41,697
he wasn't very impressive.

83
00:04:43,395 --> 00:04:44,944
Glen was the big egg, Cody was the small egg

84
00:04:44,945 --> 00:04:48,007
he can't help it, you know, that's just the way he is.

85
00:04:48,398 --> 00:04:51,312
I mean he's out there in the water all day,

86
00:04:52,849 --> 00:04:54,483
shirking his responsibilities.

87
00:04:55,846 --> 00:04:58,106
Hatching these eggs is a big responsibility

88
00:04:58,601 --> 00:05:00,474
my brother Cody, he just doesn't understand that.

89
00:05:00,475 --> 00:05:03,473
Step up and be a man.

90
00:05:03,474 --> 00:05:04,474
Takes a real man to sit on an egg.

91
00:05:04,475 --> 00:05:05,475
You know it.

92
00:05:08,385 --> 00:05:10,664
He wants to be different, all the time with the different...

93
00:05:12,528 --> 00:05:14,660
Thanks for making it...

94
00:05:15,116 --> 00:05:16,719
yeah, sorry, just too good to miss.

95
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,720
Yeah, thanks for making it.

96
00:05:17,721 --> 00:05:18,721
Yeah how was it out there?

97
00:05:19,325 --> 00:05:20,755
He's the big brother, I'm the little brother.

98
00:05:20,756 --> 00:05:21,756
I'm not touchin' ya

99
00:05:21,757 --> 00:05:22,757
not gonna touch ya.

100
00:05:22,758 --> 00:05:23,758
Do you see this?

101
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:27,023
He makes sure that I know that too

102
00:05:27,024 --> 00:05:28,024
I had to fight for everything

103
00:05:28,025 --> 00:05:30,710
even Mom's tuna casserole, you know?

104
00:05:38,372 --> 00:05:39,368
I'm lucky I survived.

105
00:05:39,369 --> 00:05:40,943
It really wasn't that easy for him

106
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,754
growing up.

107
00:05:42,917 --> 00:05:45,009
Like I said, before, uh...

108
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:47,799
he never, he never really knew his father.

109
00:05:50,812 --> 00:05:52,757
I'm not really the person to ask about it truthfully

110
00:05:52,758 --> 00:05:54,631
because I was just too young to remember.

111
00:05:54,632 --> 00:05:57,663
I mean look I'm not the only kid on the island

112
00:05:57,689 --> 00:06:01,011
who's Dad, was you know,  eaten.

113
00:06:01,012 --> 00:06:03,498
Still...it had to be tramatic.

114
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,382
No, not for me bro'... not for me.

115
00:06:08,922 --> 00:06:10,477
What's your dream?

116
00:06:10,381 --> 00:06:11,890
To go ... uh, uh ... away.

117
00:06:11,891 --> 00:06:14,607
To go away, that's, that's great.

118
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:16,332
Do you guys want a drink?

119
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:17,333
Gotta run away...

120
00:06:17,334 --> 00:06:18,334
They don't want a drink.

121
00:06:18,335 --> 00:06:19,335
...shirk responsibility and life.

122
00:06:19,336 --> 00:06:23,045
This is kind of, this is unique, this is, this is not the norm, so uh...

123
00:06:23,385 --> 00:06:24,253
Thbbbtttt!

124
00:06:24,254 --> 00:06:25,911
When is this not happening?

125
00:06:25,912 --> 00:06:26,912
What?  Don't make that noise.

126
00:06:26,913 --> 00:06:28,433
Thbbbbbbttttttt!

127
00:06:28,434 --> 00:06:29,434
Cody!

128
00:06:29,435 --> 00:06:30,435
It's really disrespectful.

129
00:06:30,436 --> 00:06:31,436
Thbbbbtttt!

130
00:06:31,437 --> 00:06:33,893
I would never do that.

131
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:34,894
Mmmhmm.

132
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:37,777
You just wouldn't make it out of your mouth.

133
00:06:37,778 --> 00:06:38,778
You know what?

134
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:39,779
That's the difference between you and me.

135
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:40,780
You know what?  I can't do this anymore.

136
00:06:42,815 --> 00:06:43,947
Look what you did!

137
00:06:43,948 --> 00:06:45,057
This is for me, this isn't for you.

138
00:06:45,058 --> 00:06:46,058
Why is Glen still here?

139
00:06:46,059 --> 00:06:47,059
Exactly!  Mom!

140
00:06:48,924 --> 00:06:50,653
I don't understand why everybody has to be so judgemental

141
00:06:50,654 --> 00:06:51,654
I understand why Mom's judgemental

142
00:06:53,056 --> 00:06:54,831
I think it's because she cares partially.

143
00:06:54,832 --> 00:06:58,294
I think it's also partially because everyone else is lookin' at her like

144
00:06:58,295 --> 00:07:01,390
hey Cody's just a bum, Cody's this, Cody's that, Cody's this.

145
00:07:01,391 --> 00:07:05,245
Cody's me bro' ...let me be me.

146
00:07:05,246 --> 00:07:06,246
When is that gonna start?

147
00:07:20,209 --> 00:07:21,503
You know what they call me?

148
00:07:21,504 --> 00:07:23,850
The dreammaker, the dream...maker.

149
00:07:23,851 --> 00:07:24,851
I find these kids, I bring them here

150
00:07:24,852 --> 00:07:29,260
and I give them a chance to be somebody.

151
00:07:30,475 --> 00:07:33,251
You know, my greatest joy as surf promoter?

152
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:35,040
Finding Z.  Watching him rise to the top.

153
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:36,881
I still can't believe he's gone.

154
00:07:36,882 --> 00:07:38,547
He was like a son to me, you know.

155
00:07:38,582 --> 00:07:41,712
It was a heart thing, you know, it was a heart...

156
00:07:41,713 --> 00:07:43,398
give me like just 5 minutes.

157
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,399
How's my hair? Is it messed up?

158
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,400
'Cause I ain't got all day...shut up.

159
00:07:45,401 --> 00:07:46,401
Is it mussed?  Is it mussed?

160
00:07:46,402 --> 00:07:48,886
We just have a few more questions about Big Z.

161
00:07:48,887 --> 00:07:49,887
But, right now I think we're more interested in

162
00:07:49,888 --> 00:07:53,157
telling the Reggie Bellafonte story and who could blame us?

163
00:07:53,158 --> 00:07:55,312
But Big Z is kind of the focus of our ...

164
00:07:55,313 --> 00:07:57,356
Hey lets get the coconut filler guy over here

165
00:07:57,357 --> 00:07:58,357
and how about the guy sweeping the sand?

166
00:07:58,358 --> 00:08:00,547
Can we hear your boring story about

167
00:08:00,548 --> 00:08:01,548
your tedious, worthless...

168
00:08:01,549 --> 00:08:02,549
Hmmm? Me?

169
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:03,550
...ridiculous life?

170
00:08:03,551 --> 00:08:04,551
Get your feathers off me!

171
00:08:04,552 --> 00:08:05,552
Stop!  Stop!

172
00:08:05,553 --> 00:08:06,553
I haven't got all day

173
00:08:06,554 --> 00:08:07,554
I've got a big production here.

174
00:08:07,555 --> 00:08:08,555
Roll it okay, just roll it!

175
00:08:08,556 --> 00:08:12,313
Welcome fans to another edition of SPEN sports!

176
00:08:12,314 --> 00:08:15,373
This is Zel Masacala and we're here at the

177
00:08:15,374 --> 00:08:18,908
surfing capital of the world...Pen Gu Island.

178
00:08:18,909 --> 00:08:21,005
For a preview of the 10th annual

179
00:08:21,006 --> 00:08:23,133
Big Z Memorial Surf Off.

180
00:08:24,628 --> 00:08:26,116
Professional surfers extrordinare...

181
00:08:26,117 --> 00:08:27,932
Kelly and Rob, tell us...

182
00:08:29,022 --> 00:08:31,825
What kind of challenges our surfers are going to face?

183
00:08:31,826 --> 00:08:34,741
Well, first things first, Zel, the waves

184
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:36,352
it's the perfect combination of beauty and danger.

185
00:08:36,353 --> 00:08:38,041
Even the pros are terrified of this place.

186
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:45,135
Dig this Zel, the section behind me

187
00:08:45,136 --> 00:08:46,840
it's called the boneyards.

188
00:08:46,841 --> 00:08:49,436
Very few surfers have ventured in there and come out alive.

189
00:08:49,437 --> 00:08:52,221
Are you trying to tell me people have died here?

190
00:08:52,222 --> 00:08:53,222
That's right Zel.

191
00:08:53,223 --> 00:08:54,878
Moment of silence for them...

192
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:55,879
And, we keep it moving

193
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,028
because if the boneyards was not enough

194
00:08:59,029 --> 00:09:01,216
our surfers will be facing off with

195
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:03,342
Tank the Shredder Evans.

196
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:06,146
Tank, 9 time defending champ.

197
00:09:07,543 --> 00:09:10,381
A role model? No, but I do consider myself

198
00:09:10,382 --> 00:09:12,566
somebody everyone should look up to.

199
00:09:12,567 --> 00:09:15,375
Kids should try to uh, pretend that they're Tank.

200
00:09:15,376 --> 00:09:17,863
I mean they should try [laughs].  Good luck kids.

201
00:09:18,913 --> 00:09:21,383
You never want to get in there and, you know, like help them out

202
00:09:22,087 --> 00:09:25,485
and show them how to surf and spend some time with the kids?

203
00:09:25,486 --> 00:09:28,410
No, no I don't want to do that, anyway this is my wave.

204
00:09:28,411 --> 00:09:31,869
Always classy, Tank Evans...coming up after the break, penguin dodge ball.

205
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:32,870
Stick around!

206
00:09:34,026 --> 00:09:36,728
Okay, to get to the competion I just want to say, uh

207
00:09:36,729 --> 00:09:39,639
I'm scouring the globe for the next big thing

208
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,640
but that's another story.

209
00:09:46,796 --> 00:09:48,155
He doesn't look for them, I find them

210
00:09:48,156 --> 00:09:50,289
I find these penguins I find the talent.

211
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:54,154
Reggie, my boss, has sent me literally everywhere on this trip.

212
00:09:54,155 --> 00:09:58,309
Any place there's an ocean, a lake, a puddle...it's ridiculous.

213
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:02,620
I am on so much migraine medication, you have no idea.

214
00:10:02,621 --> 00:10:06,549
The stress is killing me I don't know how much longer I can last

215
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,689
I have to tell you that right now.

216
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:15,339
You gotta try the blowhole thing man this whale dude is giving me a brain freeze.

217
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:19,374
I, uh, I lost a bet.

218
00:10:20,734 --> 00:10:25,739
Excuse me, excuse me, does this entire frozen wasteland surf?

219
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,740
Ah...the Cody Maverick kid does that.

220
00:10:26,741 --> 00:10:27,741
Wonderful, thank you.

221
00:10:27,742 --> 00:10:30,801
You know you're sittin' on thin ice.

222
00:10:30,802 --> 00:10:33,824
Excuse me, I looking for uh, I'm looking for Cody Maverick,

223
00:10:33,825 --> 00:10:36,009
has anyone seen Cody Maverick?

224
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,010
I'm, I'm Cody Maverick.

225
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:42,402
Mikey Abromowitz from the Big Z Memorial Surf Off...Pen Gu Island.

226
00:10:42,403 --> 00:10:46,032
Quite a slip and slider aren't ya?

227
00:10:47,904 --> 00:10:49,789
What an honor sir, honestly what an honor.

228
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,797
I hear you, uh, surf is this true?

229
00:10:51,798 --> 00:10:53,434
Listen, you gotta see what I can do, please?

230
00:10:53,435 --> 00:10:54,435
You can actually stand on a board?

231
00:10:54,436 --> 00:10:55,436
I'll be right back, then you're gonna see what I can do

232
00:10:55,437 --> 00:10:58,261
then you're gonna be happy, everthing's gonna be good, and then I'm coming with you.

233
00:10:58,262 --> 00:10:59,262
I can't imagine a better day.

234
00:10:59,263 --> 00:11:05,270
Ma, Ma, Ma, the scout, Mikey he came, he came, he's here

235
00:11:05,271 --> 00:11:08,209
he's giving me a shot now Ma, will you come watch me surf?

236
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:09,210
No, no that's okay.

237
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:10,211
Just this time?

238
00:11:10,212 --> 00:11:11,212
I'm busy, I'm chopping here.

239
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:15,657
Uh, oh, okay, alright wish me luck.

240
00:11:15,658 --> 00:11:18,066
Cody, just be careful of those big waves.

241
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:23,738
Well, anytime now.

242
00:11:23,739 --> 00:11:26,864
You know you should have been here yesterday

243
00:11:27,567 --> 00:11:28,839
we had a sweet swell yesterday

244
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:32,052
I was doing some layback 360's, some floaters, it was insane.

245
00:11:32,053 --> 00:11:33,053
Whoa! Start the whale.

246
00:11:33,054 --> 00:11:34,054
No, no, no, wait, wait, wait

247
00:11:34,055 --> 00:11:35,055
just give me one more chance

248
00:11:35,056 --> 00:11:36,592
all I need is one, please?

249
00:11:36,593 --> 00:11:37,593
You just had it.

250
00:11:37,594 --> 00:11:40,269
Better luck next year.

251
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,270
Come on, let's go

252
00:11:41,271 --> 00:11:42,271
let's go, let's go.

253
00:11:45,597 --> 00:11:47,867
I never won anything my whole life

254
00:11:50,249 --> 00:11:52,625
you know, just once I want to feel like a winner.

255
00:11:52,626 --> 00:11:54,884
You know I used to scout songbirds

256
00:11:54,885 --> 00:11:57,329
toucans, for this musical review in Brazil.

257
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:58,964
Now that's show business.

258
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:04,515
I don't care what you say, I'm coming to Pen Gu.

259
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:06,777
No way, no how

260
00:12:06,778 --> 00:12:07,778
this is a contest

261
00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:10,572
for big wave surfers.

262
00:12:10,573 --> 00:12:12,271
Can't this blubber ball go any faster?

263
00:12:14,876 --> 00:12:16,358
No, no, no no nooo!

264
00:12:21,479 --> 00:12:24,368
Eh, poor kid, I feel bad a little bit, honestly.

265
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:25,369
Wait, wait.

266
00:12:38,087 --> 00:12:39,406
Did you guys see that?  He almost had my board.

267
00:12:39,407 --> 00:12:40,407
almost had it.

268
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:45,883
Yeah, so anyway...

269
00:13:07,158 --> 00:13:08,375
We got ya, we got ya

270
00:13:08,376 --> 00:13:09,376
you are heavier than you look.

271
00:13:11,683 --> 00:13:13,807
Man we did it, team work always pays off.

272
00:13:13,808 --> 00:13:14,808
I'm Chicken Joe, man.

273
00:13:14,809 --> 00:13:15,809
Thanks, Joe.

274
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:20,021
Don't you ever, ever do anything like that in the contest, alright?

275
00:13:20,022 --> 00:13:22,356
Yeah, you're in, 'cause that was entertaining

276
00:13:22,357 --> 00:13:24,482
in a horrifying sort of way.

277
00:13:24,483 --> 00:13:27,465
[Crowd] Yeah, alright, alright!

278
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:32,036
My name's Cody Maverick, Shiverpool, you?

279
00:13:32,037 --> 00:13:34,182
No, I'm not from Shiverpool.

280
00:13:34,183 --> 00:13:35,183
Where are you from?

281
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:38,060
Dude, I'm from Lake Michigan

282
00:13:38,061 --> 00:13:42,543
that's where I surf, I was the only one around my town who did it

283
00:13:42,544 --> 00:13:46,339
and uh, a lot of people thought I was crazy, but I'm used to that.

284
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,340
I know how you feel Joe...

285
00:13:47,341 --> 00:13:48,341
You do?

286
00:13:48,342 --> 00:13:49,342
...yeah.

287
00:13:49,343 --> 00:13:50,343
Radical.

288
00:13:53,436 --> 00:13:58,176
Woo hoo hoo! Butt freeze! Woo!  Somebody help the chicken.

289
00:14:39,347 --> 00:14:41,319
Slater, Muchato, how's it going bro's?

290
00:14:41,468 --> 00:14:42,754

I'm standing, I'm standing where Z stood! Hoo hoo hoo! Oh man! Oh man.

294
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:16,487
Dude, you gotta try this.

295
00:15:16,488 --> 00:15:17,488
Nah, I'm okay

00:15:17,489 --> 00:15:22,089
c'mon just one bite.  ...alright one bite, that's it.

297
00:15:23,855 --> 00:15:25,411
Well, well what do you think?

298
00:15:25,412 --> 00:15:27,791
It's not bad it kinda tastes like chicken.

299
00:15:31,046 --> 00:15:33,550
Coming through...ah, crap.

300
00:15:38,995 --> 00:15:40,771
Oh man, I'm in love.

301
00:15:40,772 --> 00:15:44,208
Help me! I'm drowning!

302
00:15:48,172 --> 00:15:51,743
What are you standing here next to me for, go talk to her man.

303
00:15:51,744 --> 00:15:52,744
No I'm not going to talk to her.

304
00:15:52,745 --> 00:15:55,037
She diggin' on ya...she called you crap.

305
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:56,038
Thanks again.

306
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:59,447
Alright, well this is the 3rd time you've been unconscience this week

307
00:15:59,448 --> 00:16:01,914
I just don't think it's very good for your brain.

308
00:16:01,915 --> 00:16:02,915
I know.

309
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,122
That was awesome how you save his life and all

310
00:16:08,123 --> 00:16:11,218
that was just unbelievable, really.

311
00:16:13,771 --> 00:16:15,060
You here for the surf contest.

312
00:16:15,061 --> 00:16:16,061
Uh, mmhmm.

313
00:16:16,062 --> 00:16:18,356
Well, I'll be watching you.

314
00:16:19,792 --> 00:16:21,215
Really?  You'll be watching me?

315
00:16:21,216 --> 00:16:23,226
Well, yeah, from the lifeguard station.

316
00:16:23,227 --> 00:16:24,227
Oh, yeah, well...

317
00:16:24,228 --> 00:16:25,228
It's my job.

318
00:16:25,229 --> 00:16:26,229
Right.

319
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:28,491
Are you gonna kiss her or what?

320
00:16:28,492 --> 00:16:29,492
C'mon Joe.

321
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:31,648
Dude, you were saying you were in love with her.

322
00:16:31,794 --> 00:16:32,794
No, I didn't say that.

323
00:16:32,795 --> 00:16:33,795
Alright look, he really diggs ya...

324
00:16:33,796 --> 00:16:34,796
Shhhh!

325
00:16:34,797 --> 00:16:35,797
See ya!

326
00:16:36,849 --> 00:16:38,870
Yeah, I love my job I have an amazing job

327
00:16:38,871 --> 00:16:42,463
just this week with the contest coming up and all it's a little crazy.

328
00:16:42,464 --> 00:16:45,554
You really have to be extra, extra attentive.

329
00:16:45,555 --> 00:16:48,619
You have so many guys in the water you can't miss a thing.

330
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,620
But you know what?

331
00:16:49,621 --> 00:16:52,605
I have a perfect record, I've never lost anybody.

332
00:16:52,606 --> 00:16:55,035
Sure, there have been close calls...

333
00:16:55,036 --> 00:16:56,036
Help! Help!

334
00:16:56,037 --> 00:16:57,037
Oh, Arnold I turn my back for one...

335
00:16:57,038 --> 00:17:01,542
Just lay some feeling on her, you know through words...

336
00:17:01,543 --> 00:17:05,080
Walk me through the approach, I'm Lani, you're me.

337
00:17:05,081 --> 00:17:07,568
You sure about that? I get real serious.

338
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:08,569
Let's, no...let's, no.

339
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:09,570
Whoa...

340
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:10,571
What is it?

341
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:15,100
That's it, that's Big Z's shrine, remember?

342
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:17,783
Yyyea...no, no not really.

343
00:17:19,181 --> 00:17:22,426
Today the world of surfing lost one of it's legends.

344
00:17:22,427 --> 00:17:27,220
Big Z took his final ride this morning during a competition

345
00:17:27,221 --> 00:17:30,033
with up and coming surfer, Tank Evans.

346
00:17:30,034 --> 00:17:35,579
Z was last seen paddling into a massive swell off Pen Gu Bay.

347
00:17:45,401 --> 00:17:49,862
Friends of Big Z gathered to remember and celebrate his life.

348
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:56,696
Great shot!  Yes...everytime!

349
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:01,663
Hey!  Stop doing that! Stop cut it out.

350
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:02,664
That's like 3 in row.

351
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:03,665
Here, give it a shot.

352
00:18:04,864 --> 00:18:13,582
Hey! what? wait a minute, look at this...it's a Big Z necklace.

353
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:16,792
That's not funny, stop, hey no stop, what are you doing?

354
00:18:16,793 --> 00:18:19,318
Look everybody, it's Big Z's last fan...

355
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:20,319
Coming through, out of the way

356
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,320
We deserve to talk about this...

357
00:18:21,321 --> 00:18:22,321
He's a big zero...

358
00:18:22,322 --> 00:18:23,322
Shut your mouth.

359
00:18:23,323 --> 00:18:24,323
...zero starts with Z!

360
00:18:24,324 --> 00:18:27,307
You'll never be as good as Big Z, Stank.

361
00:18:27,495 --> 00:18:29,166
[Crowd] Ohhhhh.....

362
00:18:29,167 --> 00:18:32,635
Hey, hey people, c'mon now, smile on your brother.

363
00:18:32,636 --> 00:18:33,636
Keep your girlfriend out of this.

364
00:18:33,637 --> 00:18:35,883
Hey, whoa...you can't do that to my friend.

365
00:18:37,789 --> 00:18:39,637
Wow, you're getting quite a workout there, oh, that feels good.

366
00:18:39,638 --> 00:18:42,293
Hey, why don't you work on my glutes a little bit?

367
00:18:42,294 --> 00:18:43,294
Ewww...that's very nice.

368
00:18:44,992 --> 00:18:47,606
Whoa, whoa, whoa alright, that's enough guys, c'mon.

369
00:18:47,607 --> 00:18:49,954
I'll take you on anytime, anywhere.

370
00:18:49,955 --> 00:18:53,404
Oh, well then, how about right here right now, huh?

371
00:18:53,405 --> 00:18:56,208
Hey, Mikey, Mikey, get this kid a board.

372
00:18:56,209 --> 00:19:00,135
Alright, who wants to see the little guy take on the champ?

373
00:19:00,136 --> 00:19:01,136
Little guys rule!

374
00:19:01,137 --> 00:19:07,336
A little one on one surfing action between Tank Evans and...

375
00:19:08,569 --> 00:19:12,774
Jerry...Cody, Cody...Cody Maverick, Cory Mavencourt.

376
00:19:12,775 --> 00:19:15,879
And the one that rides the biggest wave, wins!

377
00:19:27,932 --> 00:19:31,819
Are you nervous about going against Tank Evans today?

378
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:32,820
Ahh, Tank, what do I have to be nervous about?

379
00:19:54,553 --> 00:19:56,319
I'm going to chum the water with your head!

380
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,320
Bring it on pecker face, let's go.

381
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,321
Pecker face?

382
00:20:15,724 --> 00:20:18,874
So, Cody, when you take your first wave and the whole island's there to watch

383
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:19,875
what's it gonna be like?

384
00:20:19,876 --> 00:20:23,212
It's going to be amazing, honestly, it's going to be the best wave of my life

385
00:20:23,213 --> 00:20:25,215
and I hope the cameras are rolling 'cause you're gonna want to watch it

386
00:20:25,216 --> 00:20:27,185
over and over and over and over again.

387
00:20:27,186 --> 00:20:28,186
It's gonna be awesome!

388
00:20:28,187 --> 00:20:29,187
Ahhhhhhhhh!

389
00:20:33,193 --> 00:20:36,251
Ahhhhhhhhhh!

390
00:20:39,963 --> 00:20:42,668
Ahhhhhhhh!

391
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:48,076
I can't look poor kid

392
00:20:48,077 --> 00:20:50,554
That was spectacular, whoa!

393
00:20:53,337 --> 00:20:55,469
I'm number one...The TANK!!!

394
00:21:30,282 --> 00:21:31,876
We're trying to get the details, we're trying to figure it out,

395
00:21:32,019 --> 00:21:34,774
the lifeguard just pulled him in.

396
00:21:37,191 --> 00:21:39,372
That's what happens when you take on the Tank, right?

397
00:21:42,485 --> 00:21:45,876
Cody, Cody, how is he is he okay, what can I do?

398
00:21:45,877 --> 00:21:51,319
I can help though, except if there's blood, just the thought of blood makes me...

399
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,320
Somebody help the chicken.

400
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,244
Tank, you okay?  Tank needs fuel.

401
00:21:57,245 --> 00:21:58,245
Mikey get the board will ya?

402
00:22:06,703 --> 00:22:09,450
Did I win? I won, huh?

403
00:22:09,451 --> 00:22:12,260
You should have stayed in Antartica, kid.

404
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,717
You're going to be okay.

405
00:22:16,713 --> 00:22:18,900
There's pixies everywhere.

406
00:22:20,826 --> 00:22:23,146
What do you guys think about Cody going into a contest

407
00:22:23,147 --> 00:22:24,147
and possibly winning?

408
00:22:24,148 --> 00:22:25,148
You know I'm, I'm...

409
00:22:25,149 --> 00:22:26,149
[laugh] Why did you just laugh?

410
00:22:27,633 --> 00:22:29,728
Because he keeps saying possible

411
00:22:29,729 --> 00:22:31,977
like it's possible that you're going to win

412
00:22:31,978 --> 00:22:33,877
and like you're going to do anything

413
00:22:33,878 --> 00:22:36,205
I mean, really, what are the chances?

414
00:22:36,206 --> 00:22:37,206
They're high, aren't they high?

415
00:22:37,207 --> 00:22:39,949
I mean they're normal chances.

416
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:40,950
It's not like I'm like the underdog.

417
00:22:52,651 --> 00:22:57,090
Hey Geek, Geek, Geek help

418
00:22:57,091 --> 00:22:58,091
Geek [snoring]

419
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:06,272
Geek...wake up! I need your help.

420
00:23:06,273 --> 00:23:07,273
Lani

421
00:23:07,274 --> 00:23:10,193
C'mon get off your lazy butt and come help me.

422
00:23:10,194 --> 00:23:11,194
...beautiful dream

423
00:23:11,195 --> 00:23:12,195
Okay

424
00:23:12,196 --> 00:23:13,196
Do you know Sheila?

425
00:23:13,197 --> 00:23:14,197
No, I don't know Sheila.

426
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:18,515
Wait, wait, wait, who's this guy?

427
00:23:18,516 --> 00:23:19,516
He's a surfer, he's hurt.

428
00:23:19,517 --> 00:23:20,517
Who are those guys?

429
00:23:20,518 --> 00:23:21,518
They're with him ignore them.

430
00:23:23,851 --> 00:23:25,254
Lani, Lani, what are you doing?

431
00:23:25,255 --> 00:23:26,255
They'll go away.

432
00:23:28,619 --> 00:23:29,890
Hey, get outta here.

433
00:23:29,891 --> 00:23:30,891
Help him!

434
00:23:30,892 --> 00:23:31,892
Where do want him?

435
00:23:31,893 --> 00:23:34,013
Nowhere, that's the whole point.

436
00:23:34,014 --> 00:23:36,612
No outsiders Lani, c'mon.

437
00:23:36,613 --> 00:23:37,613
I know, I know, I know

438
00:23:37,614 --> 00:23:40,052
this is an emergency he went down bad over the falls

439
00:23:40,053 --> 00:23:41,053
I don't if he, if he...

440
00:23:45,472 --> 00:23:46,602
And did he hit the reef?

441
00:23:46,603 --> 00:23:49,109
I don't know, I'm not sure...I got him after...

442
00:23:49,473 --> 00:23:50,464
Is he your boyfriend?

443
00:23:50,465 --> 00:23:51,465
No, no...

444
00:23:51,466 --> 00:23:54,835
Whoa, looks like he stepped on a fire urchin.

445
00:23:54,836 --> 00:23:56,854
Stepped on me? Stepped on me?

446
00:23:57,134 --> 00:23:59,035
Are you kidding? This guy was dancing on me.

447
00:23:59,036 --> 00:24:00,036
I mean just look at this

448
00:24:00,037 --> 00:24:03,999
broken, broken, gone, gone, broken, broken...broken.

449
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
This is, this pretty bad

450
00:24:07,577 --> 00:24:09,144
this is really bad.

451
00:24:09,145 --> 00:24:10,145
Oww! Oww!

452
00:24:10,146 --> 00:24:13,039
Cody, you're alright, you're going to be okay.

453
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,265
Uh, maybe I shouldn't have taken that out

454
00:24:15,377 --> 00:24:17,927
uh, poison's released, it's amazing

455
00:24:17,928 --> 00:24:18,928
What's amazing?

456
00:24:18,929 --> 00:24:19,929
That you're still alive.

457
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:22,002
It's alright, though, I'm gonna fix ya up.

458
00:24:22,003 --> 00:24:23,718
I can fix your foot just fine.

459
00:24:25,349 --> 00:24:26,519
Where is it?

460
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,058
A saw, he's got a saw!

461
00:24:29,059 --> 00:24:30,059
Oww, Oww!

462
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:32,539
He's pushing the poison all over his body.

463
00:24:36,284 --> 00:24:37,039
There it is.

464
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,287
What are you doing?

465
00:24:40,288 --> 00:24:41,288
What is he doing?

466
00:24:41,289 --> 00:24:43,373
This is a surefire cure I learned it from an old medicine man

467
00:24:43,374 --> 00:24:45,842
that could, uh, well, works wonders.

468
00:24:47,062 --> 00:24:48,495
What, no! Not that!

469
00:24:48,496 --> 00:24:50,265
Not what, not what, what's he going to do?!

470
00:24:52,077 --> 00:24:54,089
C'mon now...Geek stop...let's do this

471
00:24:54,111 --> 00:24:57,053
Lani, make some water sounds.

472
00:24:57,054 --> 00:24:58,054
Oh my gosh, this is so gross.

473
00:24:58,055 --> 00:24:59,055
[Lani making water sounds]

474
00:24:59,056 --> 00:25:02,240
No, no, no, no...

475
00:25:02,241 --> 00:25:03,241
Ahhh!

476
00:25:07,233 --> 00:25:08,673
You better keep your mouth shut.

477
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:09,674
See, what did I tell ya?

478
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:10,675
Hold his foot still, Lani.

479
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:14,381
C'mon, knock him out or something I'm running on empty here.

480
00:25:14,382 --> 00:25:15,382
I'm trying.

481
00:25:20,583 --> 00:25:23,539
So, how ya been?

482
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:27,087
Wow, sea urchin in the foot that sounds pretty nasty.

483
00:25:27,088 --> 00:25:28,088
Yeah

484
00:25:28,089 --> 00:25:29,640
How do you cure something like that?

485
00:25:29,641 --> 00:25:32,861
You pee on it.

486
00:25:32,862 --> 00:25:35,819
Ahh, that's disgusting...I know!

487
00:25:37,818 --> 00:25:39,400
How long am I stuck with this guy?

488
00:25:39,401 --> 00:25:40,401
Until he's better.

489
00:25:41,715 --> 00:25:46,206
Well, come back soon and please bring me some clams.

490
00:25:46,207 --> 00:25:47,207
No.

491
00:25:47,208 --> 00:25:48,208
I'm running low here.

492
00:25:48,209 --> 00:25:49,209
No, I can't keep doing this

493
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:50,210
you gotta start taking care of yourself.

494
00:25:50,211 --> 00:25:51,211
Bye.

495
00:25:53,216 --> 00:25:54,737
I need some more clams!

496
00:25:54,738 --> 00:25:55,738
O-Kay!

497
00:26:03,141 --> 00:26:05,865
[burps loudly]

498
00:26:07,356 --> 00:26:09,890
If it's just as well with you, I don't want to talk about Cody.

499
00:26:09,891 --> 00:26:12,541
He lost, that's it, that's his problem, not mine.

500
00:26:12,542 --> 00:26:14,510
Aren't you concerned about anybody's well-being?

501
00:26:14,511 --> 00:26:15,511
The kids fine, he was born in the water

502
00:26:15,512 --> 00:26:17,076
he's a penguin for crying out loud.

503
00:26:17,077 --> 00:26:18,077
Did you see that wave hit him?

504
00:26:18,078 --> 00:26:20,170
Yeah, dude, that's the whole idea of surfing.

505
00:26:20,171 --> 00:26:21,171
I care, I care!

506
00:26:21,172 --> 00:26:23,134
Mikey! wait 'til you see this

507
00:26:24,394 --> 00:26:25,549
look at those little legs

508
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:28,456
tick, tick, tickey, tick, tick, tickey, tickey, tickey

509
00:26:28,411 --> 00:26:30,720
boom cha cha, boom cha cha, boom cha cha

510
00:26:30,721 --> 00:26:31,721
What's with the boom chicka boom?

511
00:26:31,722 --> 00:26:34,062
I can't stand the sight of blood

512
00:26:34,556 --> 00:26:36,423
I can't stand the sight of blood

513
00:26:37,412 --> 00:26:40,803
I can't stand the sight of blood...Cody!

514
00:26:40,804 --> 00:26:44,230
Dude, have you seen my friend Cody?

515
00:26:44,231 --> 00:26:46,791
Hmmuhh, no.

516
00:26:46,792 --> 00:26:47,792
Cody?

517
00:26:52,392 --> 00:26:53,349
He's not under there.

518
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:57,226
Coooooddddyyyy!

519
00:26:58,783 --> 00:26:59,877
How's it goin' man?

520
00:27:03,465 --> 00:27:06,091
Yeah so I woke up this morning and didn't know where I was

521
00:27:06,092 --> 00:27:09,137
that's never a good place to be when you wake up.

522
00:27:09,138 --> 00:27:12,103
C'mon...get up

523
00:27:12,104 --> 00:27:13,104
No.

524
00:27:13,105 --> 00:27:14,105
Breakfast.

525
00:27:14,106 --> 00:27:15,106
Wakey, wakey, c'mon.

526
00:27:15,107 --> 00:27:16,107
I don't want to.

527
00:27:17,425 --> 00:27:18,570
Ow!

528
00:27:18,571 --> 00:27:19,571
How's your foot?

529
00:27:19,572 --> 00:27:21,668
My foot's fine, but my head!

530
00:27:21,669 --> 00:27:22,669
Good, good, good, c'mon.

531
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,054
What the...

532
00:27:26,055 --> 00:27:28,169
[sniffs] Shoo!

533
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:29,170
Hey, I uh, think I got a concussion.

534
00:27:33,928 --> 00:27:35,303
You know, you should meet my brother Glen

535
00:27:35,304 --> 00:27:36,304
you guys would really hit off.

536
00:27:37,659 --> 00:27:40,920
No, no, no  have you seen my necklace?

537
00:27:44,814 --> 00:27:48,337
Ah, big deal, get yourself another one at Reggies trinket shops.

538
00:27:48,338 --> 00:27:51,701
No, it's not just some necklace guy, alright, he gave it me himself.

539
00:27:51,702 --> 00:27:52,702
Who?

540
00:27:52,703 --> 00:27:53,703
Big Z when he came to shiverpool.

541
00:27:53,704 --> 00:27:57,038
That guy believed in me when nobody else did.

542
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:00,959
He told me never to give up and to find a way 'cause that's what winners do.

543
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,960
yeah, that's what winners do.

544
00:28:01,961 --> 00:28:04,582
It's funny, you know, what a loser I became.

545
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:08,166
Who cares what Big Z said?

546
00:28:08,167 --> 00:28:12,369
You gotta do things your own way.

547
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:14,654
I don't, I don't have a way.

548
00:28:07,442 --> 00:28:22,294
Ah, well, you do now, just follow this, it'll take you back to North Beach.

549
00:28:22,295 --> 00:28:26,007
Okay, nice to meet ya, Good Luck.

550
00:28:35,521 --> 00:28:37,592
What do I do now? I can't show my face on the beach

551
00:28:37,593 --> 00:28:38,593
I can't go home.

552
00:28:42,492 --> 00:28:45,254
Do you always visualize what you're going to be, what you're going to do?

553
00:28:50,027 --> 00:28:51,140
This ain't it.

554
00:29:20,554 --> 00:29:21,674
What are you doing here?

555
00:29:24,016 --> 00:29:26,635
Ah, man, thank you man, this...

556
00:29:27,642 --> 00:29:29,174
that's really cool of you to come back, thank you.

557
00:29:29,175 --> 00:29:30,175
Better keep that knot tight.

558
00:29:30,176 --> 00:29:33,477
You lose it during a contest, it's a goner.

559
00:29:33,478 --> 00:29:37,000
Yeah, well, I'm not going in any surf contest.

560
00:29:37,001 --> 00:29:43,373
Ah, well, there's more to surfing than beating Tank Evans, you know.

561
00:29:46,981 --> 00:29:49,314
Look at that, you know what you're sitting on there?

562
00:29:49,315 --> 00:29:50,315
Huh?

563
00:29:50,316 --> 00:29:54,175
That's kola wood, best surf boards in the world are made of that stuff.

564
00:29:54,176 --> 00:29:55,176
Yeah?

565
00:29:55,177 --> 00:29:56,177
You got a kola board?

566
00:29:56,178 --> 00:29:58,614
No, I don't have a board, board.

567
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:04,929
Well, you want to make one?

568
00:30:06,484 --> 00:30:07,187
No.

569
00:30:07,638 --> 00:30:10,248
What?! Man, I come all the way back here to give you the necklace

570
00:30:10,249 --> 00:30:13,968
and now I'm offering to make you a board and you say no?!

571
00:30:13,969 --> 00:30:17,340
Get off your lazy butt, we're making a board, c'mon.

572
00:30:17,341 --> 00:30:18,341
Alright, okay.

573
00:30:18,342 --> 00:30:19,937
It's going to be the best board you ever had, I'll tell you that.

574
00:30:19,938 --> 00:30:20,938
Then, okay...okay.

575
00:30:20,939 --> 00:30:21,939
Alright.

576
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:22,940
Okay Man.

577
00:30:22,941 --> 00:30:26,557
Cody...that's cool.

578
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:30,422
Joe, can you just tell us why you're out here looking for Cody?

579
00:30:30,423 --> 00:30:33,774
You know, we've known each other since way back since

580
00:30:33,775 --> 00:30:35,910
like yesterday, I think it was.

581
00:30:36,463 --> 00:30:40,165
We got a lot in common, you know I never really knew my father either.

582
00:30:46,994 --> 00:30:49,237
Ok, so why are you making surf boards in the middle of the jungle

583
00:30:49,238 --> 00:30:52,825
anyway?  I'm just trying to understand, man I don't get it you know?

584
00:30:52,826 --> 00:30:55,610
Forget the 20 questions, let's just get the board made, hmm?

585
00:30:55,611 --> 00:31:00,998
Okay, it's just...are you a surfer or do you, I mean, what...

586
00:31:03,256 --> 00:31:04,608
Ah, ha, very funny.

587
00:31:04,609 --> 00:31:06,402
Less talk more pushing, c'mon.

588
00:31:06,403 --> 00:31:09,472
Why are we pushing it anyway, why don't we just roll it?

589
00:31:09,473 --> 00:31:10,473
Ow!

590
00:31:10,474 --> 00:31:13,049
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it, I didn't know your foot was there

591
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:14,050
are you okay? I'm sorry.

592
00:31:14,051 --> 00:31:15,051
Owww!

593
00:31:15,052 --> 00:31:17,977
I'm sorry! It's not like I intentionally did it, okay, I'm sorry.

594
00:31:17,978 --> 00:31:22,375
Hey, oh, hey...Cody, Cody, the log!

595
00:31:25,086 --> 00:31:27,354
Get it Geek, Geek, stop...stop, stop!

596
00:31:29,361 --> 00:31:32,056
Cody, grab the vine, grab the vine...

597
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:35,395
...now pull it

598
00:31:35,396 --> 00:31:36,396
I'm trying!

599
00:31:42,668 --> 00:31:44,477
Ahhh, Cody!!!

600
00:31:44,478 --> 00:31:46,587
Ahhhh, Geek!!!

601
00:31:46,588 --> 00:31:47,588
Cody...

602
00:31:51,013 --> 00:31:53,116
Ahhhh Geek!!!

603
00:31:55,378 --> 00:31:58,072
Oh, no, no, no, no...no

604
00:32:00,588 --> 00:32:03,075
Help me up so I can kick your butt.

605
00:32:04,775 --> 00:32:07,565
I thought you were, I thought I killed you, you okay?

606
00:32:07,566 --> 00:32:08,566
Next time when I say don't roll the...

607
00:32:08,567 --> 00:32:11,210
What's that?  What's that?

608
00:32:14,108 --> 00:32:19,367
Yeah, the beach...sand, water, sun, you seen one you seen 'em all

609
00:32:19,368 --> 00:32:20,368
c'mon, let's get out of here.

610
00:32:20,369 --> 00:32:22,670
No, No, c'mon man let's go check it out.

611
00:32:22,671 --> 00:32:23,671
Ow.

612
00:32:24,751 --> 00:32:25,891
Ahhh!

613
00:32:28,727 --> 00:32:30,461
So, you think Cody and the Geek are doing alright?

614
00:32:30,462 --> 00:32:33,642
Yeah, yeah, I hate to see him living out there all alone

615
00:32:33,643 --> 00:32:35,744
it'll be good for him to have something to do.

616
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:50,620
Hey, somebody's old board shack.

617
00:32:59,134 --> 00:33:08,625
Look at this...whoa, whoa, whoa...these are Big Z's boards.

618
00:33:08,626 --> 00:33:11,936
Yeah, these are Big Z's boards, he rode this in the Australian Open.

619
00:33:14,745 --> 00:33:17,342
This the board he rode when he came to Shiverpool, man.

620
00:33:17,343 --> 00:33:22,581
This, I, I can't...Geek, this is Big Z's place man!

621
00:33:22,582 --> 00:33:25,420
It's where he lived, this is where he made his boards.

622
00:33:25,421 --> 00:33:26,421
Did you know this was here?

623
00:33:27,794 --> 00:33:29,432
Why didn't you want to come down here?

624
00:33:29,433 --> 00:33:32,810
...and then he, uh, he went up to this old shack, you know?

625
00:33:47,576 --> 00:33:53,010
And I realized, you know, it was Z.

626
00:34:16,824 --> 00:34:19,007
I could tell...he needed some space and you know

627
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:22,668
some time to himself, I didn't want to you know, ask him all these questions.

628
00:34:22,669 --> 00:34:25,677
So, I just kind of stood there quietly...

629
00:34:25,678 --> 00:34:29,095
You're Big Z! Aha, I can't believe it you're alive!

630
00:34:29,096 --> 00:34:30,096
You're alive!

631
00:34:30,097 --> 00:34:31,097
That's the respectful way to go I think.

632
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:35,205
Why are you alive? What happened, tell me, tell me everything.

633
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:36,206
Start at the beginning and oh, just tell me!

634
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:39,505
Kid, kid, kid, you're going to hurt yourself, relax.

635
00:34:39,506 --> 00:34:40,506
but you were dead, right? People said you were dead

636
00:34:40,507 --> 00:34:41,507
but you're not dead, you're in hiding...

637
00:34:43,446 --> 00:34:45,561
...did something happen? Something happened

638
00:34:45,562 --> 00:34:48,022
you saw something...you saw something you weren't supposed to see.

639
00:34:48,023 --> 00:34:49,208
I knew it...that's what happened!

640
00:34:49,209 --> 00:34:50,209
What are you nuts?  It's not a conspiracy

641
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:51,210
it's no big deal.

642
00:34:51,211 --> 00:34:52,211
Oh, what happened?

643
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:55,162
I don't want to talk about it.

644
00:34:58,353 --> 00:35:01,345
Okay, okay I got it I'll be over if you need anything or if

645
00:35:01,346 --> 00:35:06,053
feel like talking or you know, whatever, do you feel like it now?

646
00:35:06,054 --> 00:35:07,054
Like talking now?

647
00:35:07,055 --> 00:35:08,055
Go away.

648
00:35:08,056 --> 00:35:12,401
Got it, alright I'm going away, unless you...

649
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:13,402
Cody...

650
00:35:13,398 --> 00:35:15,971
I'm not going to lie to you, this is like, you know

651
00:35:16,104 --> 00:35:18,903
it's huge man, it changes everything, it's like

652
00:35:18,904 --> 00:35:21,406
the contest is a few days away, if I can get him to train me

653
00:35:21,407 --> 00:35:22,407
then that's...boom.

654
00:35:24,354 --> 00:35:25,887
I mean I could win this with him.

655
00:35:25,888 --> 00:35:26,888
It's my dream, you know?

656
00:35:26,889 --> 00:35:28,992
And I don't want to give up on that dream

657
00:35:28,993 --> 00:35:32,722
winners, winners find a way no matter what, right?

658
00:35:34,576 --> 00:35:36,685
A winner is...

659
00:35:38,858 --> 00:35:41,827
They see their goals, they just go for it

660
00:35:41,828 --> 00:35:42,828
they're not in it for the money or the glory.

661
00:35:42,829 --> 00:35:46,204
A winner is like...

662
00:35:47,581 --> 00:35:49,688
It's the surfer that's out there having the most fun.

663
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,433
Yep, it's a lot of fun.

664
00:35:52,472 --> 00:35:55,026
Right, no, I get ya, what's winning without the losers?

665
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:59,052
They're in it for the joy of it, the rapture and slow motion instant replays

666
00:35:59,438 --> 00:36:00,604
Mikey, why don't you head over to the snack bar

667
00:36:00,605 --> 00:36:01,605
and get yourself a big bowl of shutup!

668
00:36:02,965 --> 00:36:05,162
Feels better when there's a lot of losers around

669
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,163
was that your question?

670
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:10,236
Well, a winner is somebody who doesn't knock me off my

671
00:36:10,237 --> 00:36:14,548
surfboard, break it when I'm trying to get some big waves

672
00:36:14,549 --> 00:36:17,769
especially Tank, he is definitely not a winner.

673
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:21,000
He's a dirty trashcan full of poop.

674
00:36:21,001 --> 00:36:24,962
Yeah, I can't remember a time when I wasn't surfing, my Mom

675
00:36:25,023 --> 00:36:28,515
put me right on there, I think she pooped me out and put me right on there.

676
00:36:28,516 --> 00:36:30,548
What is about surfing that you love?

677
00:36:30,549 --> 00:36:33,108
I love being the center of attention, because

678
00:36:33,109 --> 00:36:35,993
it's really where I should be

679
00:36:35,994 --> 00:36:39,403
and uh, I love the looks my ladies give me.

680
00:36:39,404 --> 00:36:44,739
You know the little glint, I love that, I love holding the ladies.

681
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,894
You know what I'm talking about?

682
00:36:46,895 --> 00:36:48,857
Uh, I think so, sort of.

683
00:36:48,858 --> 00:36:49,858
Come on, come with me.

684
00:36:53,691 --> 00:36:55,046
I put this curtain in myself.

685
00:36:57,833 --> 00:36:58,895
These are my ladies.

686
00:37:01,108 --> 00:37:05,724
This is Jill, this is my lady, Amy, little Suzy, Brianna

687
00:37:05,725 --> 00:37:07,856
you know why we call her Brianna, right?

688
00:37:07,857 --> 00:37:08,857
No.

689
00:37:09,797 --> 00:37:10,641
It's a long story.

690
00:37:10,642 --> 00:37:15,737
Shaniqua, Helga, Miss Kitty, Jeanie, I dream of...

691
00:37:15,738 --> 00:37:16,738
Teresa.

692
00:37:18,299 --> 00:37:19,814
This is Teresa right here.

693
00:37:19,815 --> 00:37:22,349
Now is Teresa is that your...

694
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:23,350
Dirty girl.

695
00:37:24,737 --> 00:37:29,380
This spot, this spot is for my special lady, Lia.

696
00:37:29,381 --> 00:37:33,065
I'm going to say that one more time...Lia.

697
00:37:33,066 --> 00:37:37,272
Oh yeah, that's a sweet, sweet lady.

698
00:37:37,273 --> 00:37:39,287
Tank are you polishing your trophies again?!

699
00:37:39,288 --> 00:37:44,672
Mom, I wasn't polishing, I was talking to my friends.

700
00:37:47,253 --> 00:37:48,607
I'm going to polish them later.

701
00:37:53,385 --> 00:37:55,948
Mr. Topenga, Mr. Topenga, can you tell us why you're not dead?

702
00:37:55,949 --> 00:37:58,235
No, I am dead.

703
00:38:04,939 --> 00:38:06,582
What are you doing?

704
00:38:08,576 --> 00:38:13,102
Hey, who said you could...turn the board around, get back here.

705
00:38:13,103 --> 00:38:15,358
No, just come out here and show me some moves.

706
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:16,359
No, no, no.

707
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,684
Ah, why not, grab a board and come out.

708
00:38:18,685 --> 00:38:21,808
Hey, you want to kill yourself, go ahead, fine with me.

709
00:38:21,809 --> 00:38:22,809
Just don't mess up my board.

710
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:23,810
How do you turn this thing?

711
00:38:23,811 --> 00:38:26,363
It's not a short board, sit back on it.

712
00:38:26,364 --> 00:38:28,635
Hey, watch the wave.

713
00:38:31,137 --> 00:38:34,366
You mess up my board, I'm messing up your other foot.

714
00:38:34,367 --> 00:38:38,723
Hey, I'm just trying to ride this canoe or whatever, okay?

715
00:38:38,724 --> 00:38:42,218
Well, stop trying so hard...relax.

716
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:44,411
What do mean relax?!

717
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:52,163
Long smooth strokes, dig deep, dig, come on.

718
00:38:52,164 --> 00:38:53,164
I'm digging, I'm digging!

719
00:38:53,165 --> 00:38:55,187
Keep the nose up, keep it up, watch it...

720
00:39:03,073 --> 00:39:03,982
What are you doing?

721
00:39:03,983 --> 00:39:04,983
Come on, please?

722
00:39:04,984 --> 00:39:08,678
Z, I can't learn anything with you on the beach, man.

723
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:11,134
Well, then you're not going to learn anything.

724
00:39:11,135 --> 00:39:12,611
Now, come on in.

725
00:39:12,612 --> 00:39:14,816
Z, I'm not coming in until you come out.

726
00:39:14,817 --> 00:39:16,749
Oh, you're coming in alright.

727
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:18,853
He's not even watching the wave.

728
00:39:18,854 --> 00:39:19,854
What wave?

729
00:39:19,855 --> 00:39:20,855
That one.

730
00:39:21,873 --> 00:39:26,318
5, 4, 3, 2 and...

731
00:39:26,319 --> 00:39:28,866
Ahhhh!

732
00:39:38,664 --> 00:39:39,907
Don't touch my stuff man.

733
00:39:39,908 --> 00:39:43,233
I couldn't help it, I just wanted to learn from the best.

734
00:39:43,234 --> 00:39:46,834
Ah, well, I don't surf anymore.

735
00:39:47,229 --> 00:39:49,808
What? What do mean you don't surf anymore?

736
00:39:49,809 --> 00:39:52,262
Hey, hey, you want to learn how to surf the right way?

737
00:39:52,263 --> 00:39:54,144
Uhhh...sure.

738
00:39:54,145 --> 00:39:55,993
Then you got to make your own board, alright?

739
00:39:57,531 --> 00:39:59,249
What do you mean you don't...

740
00:39:59,157 --> 00:40:00,127
Can't hear you.

741
00:40:01,284 --> 00:40:02,088
Can I just ask one question about...

742
00:40:02,299 --> 00:40:02,685
I'm making a board.

743
00:40:02,686 --> 00:40:04,316
Can you tell me about your board?

744
00:40:04,317 --> 00:40:09,452
Umm, I just have a uh, palm tree board

745
00:40:09,453 --> 00:40:12,089
I would have to say it's not the nicest board

746
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:14,417
in the world, but it is a pretty good board.

747
00:40:15,129 --> 00:40:17,525
The ancient Hawaiians believe that mana, or heart,

748
00:40:17,526 --> 00:40:20,174
was transfered into the surfboard as you shaved it.

749
00:40:20,175 --> 00:40:21,175
What are your thoughts on that?

750
00:40:23,163 --> 00:40:24,358
What's up with the hair?

751
00:40:24,359 --> 00:40:25,995
You could fit a whole fish in there.

752
00:40:25,996 --> 00:40:29,141
My dream surfboard is pretty powerful

753
00:40:29,142 --> 00:40:30,979
you can add a lot of attachments to it

754
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:32,737
like a grenade launcher attachment.

755
00:40:32,738 --> 00:40:34,111
Anybody know whose board this is?

756
00:40:34,112 --> 00:40:35,112
I'm pretty sure it's the chicken's.

757
00:40:35,113 --> 00:40:36,818
Has anybody seen the chicken?

758
00:40:36,819 --> 00:40:37,819
Cody!

759
00:40:39,816 --> 00:40:40,888
I know he's out there.

760
00:40:41,617 --> 00:40:42,997
I can feel it in my nuggets.

761
00:40:43,536 --> 00:40:46,080
Man, aren't you nervous out here Joe, in the jungle

762
00:40:46,081 --> 00:40:47,081
it's kind of dangerous.

763
00:40:47,082 --> 00:40:49,176
Dude, the jungle is the most peaceful place on the planet.

764
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,595
Hold it steady.

765
00:40:57,596 --> 00:41:01,040
This is dream come true, this is a dream come true.

766
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:03,114
Here...to be here with Z doing this

767
00:41:03,115 --> 00:41:07,502
and it's kola wood which all the best boards are made of kola wood.

768
00:41:07,503 --> 00:41:09,186
Alright, now...

769
00:41:10,097 --> 00:41:12,199
...I drew this pattern as a guide.

770
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:15,746
Do you want to have your board with a lot of rocker

771
00:41:15,987 --> 00:41:16,602
or just a little?

772
00:41:16,603 --> 00:41:19,514
Uhh, I don't know, I guess I'd like...

773
00:41:19,515 --> 00:41:22,683
What you want is something in between, trust me.

774
00:41:22,684 --> 00:41:23,809
I'm the expert here, okay?

775
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:24,810
Okay.

776
00:41:24,811 --> 00:41:28,051
So, um, here are your shaping tools

777
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:32,531
now remember, the board is already inside there

778
00:41:32,532 --> 00:41:36,252
see, somewhere and what you're doing is

779
00:41:36,253 --> 00:41:38,567
you're trying to find it, reveal it.

780
00:41:38,568 --> 00:41:39,700
Okay...okay.

781
00:41:40,892 --> 00:41:41,924
Every carve counts.

782
00:41:42,868 --> 00:41:44,427
Why are you smiling? Don't smile.

783
00:41:44,428 --> 00:41:46,423
I'm not, I'm not smiling, I'm just you know, I'm excited.

784
00:41:46,424 --> 00:41:48,220
This isn't like hacking a piece of ice

785
00:41:48,221 --> 00:41:51,414
you know it takes patience and finesse.

786
00:41:51,415 --> 00:41:53,947
Alright already, I'm trying, will you just give me the tools, please?

787
00:41:53,948 --> 00:41:54,948
Alright here, take it, go ahead...

788
00:41:54,949 --> 00:41:55,949
Thank you.

789
00:41:58,368 --> 00:41:59,177
Here we go...

790
00:41:59,178 --> 00:42:01,119
What are you doing?

791
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:04,168
Look, if you're going to do it, you do it right.

792
00:42:04,169 --> 00:42:07,610
Alright, look, push the bowl with the grain

793
00:42:07,611 --> 00:42:10,309
with the grain, you see what I'm doing here?

794
00:42:11,418 --> 00:42:15,441
You let the tool do the work, you see?

795
00:42:15,442 --> 00:42:17,375
Just like you're riding a wave, you let the wave

796
00:42:17,376 --> 00:42:19,611
do the work, you don't fight the wave.

797
00:42:19,612 --> 00:42:21,993
You can't fight these big waves, Cod...

798
00:42:23,066 --> 00:42:30,906
Long strokes, loads of finesse, find the board within the tree.

799
00:42:30,907 --> 00:42:33,205
Nice and easy.

800
00:42:33,206 --> 00:42:34,206
Yeah, I got it.

801
00:42:34,207 --> 00:42:38,020
See that you just, just...

802
00:42:38,085 --> 00:42:39,073
Maybe I can do it now...

803
00:42:39,074 --> 00:42:43,228
...move with, with the...

804
00:42:43,229 --> 00:42:44,229
Can I do it now?

805
00:42:46,507 --> 00:42:47,761
[whispers] Can I do it now?

806
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:54,596
Yeah, got carried away, sorry about that

807
00:42:54,597 --> 00:42:55,597
it's your board.

808
00:42:55,598 --> 00:42:56,598
...my board.

809
00:42:57,671 --> 00:42:59,005
Okay, with the grain, I got it.

810
00:42:59,006 --> 00:43:01,702
Don't forget to eyeball it once in awhile.

811
00:43:01,703 --> 00:43:03,386
Okay, long strokes with the grain.

812
00:43:03,387 --> 00:43:04,387
Not too long.

813
00:43:04,388 --> 00:43:06,176
[Exhales loudly]  Here we go.

814
00:43:11,586 --> 00:43:12,726
You're doing it wrong, Cod...

815
00:43:12,727 --> 00:43:14,619
Will you just, will you just let me...I can't...

816
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:16,665
...no finesse when you're in my face!

817
00:43:16,666 --> 00:43:18,279
Okay?  Just let me make the board.

818
00:43:19,431 --> 00:43:20,411
Do you want my help?

819
00:43:20,412 --> 00:43:22,150
Do I...no, I don't want your help.

820
00:43:22,151 --> 00:43:23,151
I don't want your help.

821
00:43:23,152 --> 00:43:24,938
Oh, you don't want my help.

822
00:43:24,939 --> 00:43:25,939
I don't want your help.

823
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:27,508
Oh, alright, fine.

824
00:43:28,421 --> 00:43:29,608
I just want to make my board.

825
00:43:29,609 --> 00:43:31,850
Build the board yourself man, alright?

826
00:43:31,851 --> 00:43:32,851
Thank you, thank you.

827
00:43:32,852 --> 00:43:35,472
I don't care what the board looks like

828
00:43:35,473 --> 00:43:37,557
you're the one whose got to ride the board.

829
00:43:37,558 --> 00:43:38,558
Fine, thank you.

830
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:42,391
It's here somewhere, go find it.

831
00:43:42,392 --> 00:43:44,356
Walk over there, please...please.

832
00:43:44,357 --> 00:43:46,427
Don't cut yourself.

833
00:43:49,006 --> 00:43:54,965
So it's day 3, yeah, I uh, I come across Pen Guins.

834
00:43:54,966 --> 00:43:58,072
I'm Chicken Joe, Joseph, it's long for Joe.

835
00:43:58,073 --> 00:43:59,073
Hey, hey oooooo!

836
00:43:59,074 --> 00:44:00,074
Sweet man.

837
00:44:00,075 --> 00:44:04,216
...and uh, they treat me as their king and put me in a hot tub.

838
00:44:04,217 --> 00:44:06,821
It was I guess their royal hot tub.

839
00:44:10,931 --> 00:44:16,305
[tribe chants and screams]

840
00:44:23,385 --> 00:44:27,817
I'm kind of hot and steamy, but it really opened up my pores, you know?

841
00:44:30,307 --> 00:44:33,250
It was kind of cool, they kind of served me food while I was in there.

842
00:44:34,736 --> 00:44:36,670
It was like dinner and a show.

843
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:51,485
As enjoyable as it was, I still had a vision of my quest.

844
00:44:53,844 --> 00:44:54,615
Thank you.

845
00:44:54,616 --> 00:44:57,117
See you guys later, I got to get going.

846
00:45:02,851 --> 00:45:04,033
You know what else it was...

847
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:06,556
Look, okay, I had the board, the board was fine, the board was great.

848
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:11,130
How's it goin' ?

849
00:45:11,131 --> 00:45:13,236
What? no, it's going great man, it's great.

850
00:45:13,237 --> 00:45:15,127
It did look a little rough, you know?

851
00:45:15,128 --> 00:45:16,896
A little rough?  The board looked a little rough?

852
00:45:16,897 --> 00:45:18,663
It's a work in progress, bro' .

853
00:45:18,664 --> 00:45:20,787
You think it's good enough for the big waves?

854
00:45:20,788 --> 00:45:22,575
I think it's good enough for any waves.

855
00:45:22,576 --> 00:45:24,326
Ohh, ohh, ohh.

856
00:45:24,327 --> 00:45:26,497
Uh, hang on.

857
00:45:28,402 --> 00:45:30,898
Okay, let's say I'm a big wave, you know...

858
00:45:30,899 --> 00:45:33,712
Hold on! No, no, no, no, no....

859
00:45:35,105 --> 00:45:36,155
Where you going?

860
00:45:36,156 --> 00:45:37,536
It's my board man, alright?

861
00:45:37,537 --> 00:45:40,485
Why don't you take your board and go try it out?

862
00:45:40,486 --> 00:45:41,238
That's what I'm...maybe I will.

863
00:45:41,275 --> 00:45:41,976
Good.

864
00:45:41,952 --> 00:45:43,945
Piece of junk, watch...

865
00:45:46,167 --> 00:45:48,921
Oh...that was...nice ride, man.

866
00:45:48,922 --> 00:45:50,894
Nice ride.

867
00:45:52,445 --> 00:45:54,338
You know, this is supposed to be fun.

868
00:45:54,339 --> 00:45:57,709
Look, I got 3 days until the contest, I don't have time for fun.

869
00:45:58,821 --> 00:46:00,057
No time for fun, huh?

870
00:46:01,407 --> 00:46:01,943
Hey Cody...

871
00:46:02,191 --> 00:46:02,583
What?!

872
00:46:03,429 --> 00:46:05,621
bring me some clams when you come back.

873
00:46:05,893 --> 00:46:06,893
I'm not coming back.

874
00:46:07,517 --> 00:46:10,172
[laughs] He'll be back.

875
00:46:10,173 --> 00:46:11,173
No I won't!

876
00:46:11,174 --> 00:46:12,174
He'll be back.

877
00:46:13,466 --> 00:46:14,844
Hey, you guys like barbeque?

878
00:46:14,845 --> 00:46:15,845
Yeah...sure.

879
00:46:15,846 --> 00:46:16,846
We got some wood here.

880
00:46:18,201 --> 00:46:20,730
I wasted my whole day and I have nothing to show for it...

881
00:46:24,516 --> 00:46:24,854
Lani.

882
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:29,522
I was just actually going to check on you.

883
00:46:29,523 --> 00:46:30,523
That's why you were...

884
00:46:30,493 --> 00:46:31,345
...Geek

885
00:46:31,465 --> 00:46:35,149
Listen, Geek...Geek is Big Z.

886
00:46:35,772 --> 00:46:36,301
What?  I know.

887
00:46:36,302 --> 00:46:37,302
How did you find out?

888
00:46:37,303 --> 00:46:38,303
We went to the beach...

889
00:46:38,304 --> 00:46:40,187
You got him down to the beach?

890
00:46:40,188 --> 00:46:41,188
Yeah.

891
00:46:41,189 --> 00:46:43,284
I've been trying to get Z out of that tree for 10 years

892
00:46:43,285 --> 00:46:45,486
and you got him all the way down to the beach in one day?!

893
00:46:45,487 --> 00:46:46,487
Yeah.

894
00:46:46,488 --> 00:46:48,604
This is fantastic! Woo hoo!

895
00:46:49,631 --> 00:46:51,080
It's amazing!

896
00:46:52,335 --> 00:46:53,801
Do you want to go somewhere fun?

897
00:46:55,290 --> 00:46:58,647
Do you want to go somewhere really, really fun?

898
00:47:00,135 --> 00:47:02,567
Unless you want to get, Did you want to get back to Big Z?

899
00:47:02,568 --> 00:47:04,411
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have invited you.

900
00:47:04,412 --> 00:47:06,363
No, no, no, no.

901
00:47:06,364 --> 00:47:07,364
Look, I want to have fun.

902
00:47:07,365 --> 00:47:08,365
Oh, okay.

903
00:47:08,366 --> 00:47:09,984
Do I need like mints or something?

904
00:47:10,542 --> 00:47:12,956
[laughs] No, you won't need mints.

905
00:47:14,759 --> 00:47:16,790
Z used to carry us up here on his shoulders

906
00:47:16,791 --> 00:47:18,652
and we'd have so much fun

907
00:47:18,653 --> 00:47:20,418
it's one of my favorite spots on Pen Gu.

908
00:47:20,419 --> 00:47:21,419
Really?

909
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:23,010
Oh, to be 8 years old again.

910
00:47:23,011 --> 00:47:24,011
What is this?

911
00:47:24,012 --> 00:47:26,148
You don't want to get all cut up do you?

912
00:47:26,873 --> 00:47:27,879
Hold on, what are you doing?

913
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:29,472
No, no, no, no...I'm out of here.

914
00:47:29,473 --> 00:47:33,526
Ahhhhhhhhhh!

915
00:47:49,106 --> 00:47:52,006
Stop fighting it Cody, just let go!

916
00:48:00,186 --> 00:48:02,202
I'm in front of you now!

917
00:48:13,566 --> 00:48:15,861
Okay, don't take the left...Cody!

918
00:48:20,831 --> 00:48:23,564
Give up slowpoke, it's over!

919
00:48:23,565 --> 00:48:24,565
Not for long!

920
00:48:30,457 --> 00:48:32,322
Ha, ha, ha...I beat you!

921
00:48:32,323 --> 00:48:34,956
Congratulations...you sure did!

922
00:48:34,957 --> 00:48:36,847
You should probably get out of there.

923
00:48:36,848 --> 00:48:39,750
Why's that?  This stuff is slickety, it's so beautiful look at it!

924
00:48:39,751 --> 00:48:40,751
What is this stuff?

925
00:48:40,752 --> 00:48:42,383
See those things up above you?

926
00:48:42,384 --> 00:48:43,384
Uh-huh.

927
00:48:43,385 --> 00:48:44,385
They're glow worms...so

928
00:48:44,386 --> 00:48:46,712
you're right beneath them.

929
00:48:46,713 --> 00:48:47,713
Uh-huh.

930
00:48:47,714 --> 00:48:48,714
Yeah, that's poop.

931
00:48:58,558 --> 00:49:02,546
You know how some stinks, stink, and other stinks smell good?

932
00:49:02,547 --> 00:49:03,547
Yeah.

933
00:49:03,548 --> 00:49:04,548
This is like a good stink.

934
00:49:04,549 --> 00:49:05,549
A good stink?

935
00:49:06,618 --> 00:49:08,126
Can I tell you something personal?

936
00:49:08,127 --> 00:49:10,725
We're in the shower together, you can say whatever you want.

937
00:49:10,726 --> 00:49:11,726
I'm serious!

938
00:49:11,727 --> 00:49:14,979
I'm really, really, really jealous of you.

939
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:16,322
Why?

940
00:49:16,323 --> 00:49:22,929
I couldn't get Z off his butt for the last 10 years and you come along

941
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:25,360
...he must really think a lot of you.

942
00:49:26,536 --> 00:49:30,537
I don't know, I've been a jerk to him so I don't know what he thinks about me.

943
00:49:30,538 --> 00:49:32,282
No you haven't.  I have, I've been a jerk to him.

944
00:49:34,289 --> 00:49:37,128
Then go, not be a jerk.

945
00:49:37,129 --> 00:49:38,924
Why does it matter to you anyways?

946
00:49:39,607 --> 00:49:42,361
He's my uncle. He's the only family I've got.

947
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:52,935
[both laugh]...okay.

948
00:49:58,205 --> 00:50:01,722
[snoring]

949
00:50:56,274 --> 00:51:05,508
Z, no, don't you do it, Z, don't do it, no...I swear man...

950
00:51:05,468 --> 00:51:06,509
If you break it...

951
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:08,573
It should have been broken by now.

952
00:51:09,988 --> 00:51:11,373
Come on, man, come on!

953
00:51:17,057 --> 00:51:23,051
Look at that, that's the best place in the world to be...in the tube.

954
00:51:23,052 --> 00:51:24,052
Really?

955
00:51:24,053 --> 00:51:26,511
Ah, yeah, better than winning.

956
00:51:26,512 --> 00:51:28,716
The trophy...all that stuff.

957
00:51:29,905 --> 00:51:33,122
Tube riding is the ultimate, ultimate thing in surfing

958
00:51:33,123 --> 00:51:35,386
to ride inside the wave and make it out of it

959
00:51:35,387 --> 00:51:36,387
it's all we want to do every day.

960
00:51:36,388 --> 00:51:40,105
Oh, it's, it's almost impossible to describe

961
00:51:40,106 --> 00:51:42,206
there's nothing I can compare it to.

962
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:46,412
It's a feeling, that, um, you know not too many people will experience

963
00:51:46,413 --> 00:51:49,371
and uh, and uh, so it's special in that sense.

964
00:51:49,372 --> 00:51:51,296
And then you just try to remember it, your like geez

965
00:51:51,297 --> 00:51:53,935
I wish I could remember that or I wish I could get that again

966
00:51:53,936 --> 00:51:55,267
it's just addicting.

967
00:51:56,256 --> 00:51:58,988
Ah, once you get inside, you never want to get out.

968
00:52:00,051 --> 00:52:02,394
Wow...that's amazing.

969
00:52:02,395 --> 00:52:04,850
Oh yeah man, nothing like it.

970
00:52:05,885 --> 00:52:10,799
Okay, so that aside, well, I mean how many points would you get for getting tubed?

971
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:13,304
Like what does it depend on for the contest?

972
00:52:13,305 --> 00:52:14,305
Points?!

973
00:52:15,783 --> 00:52:16,363
What?

974
00:52:16,364 --> 00:52:18,779
Do you know who you sound like right now?

975
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:21,869
I promote happiness, can you see the happiness

976
00:52:21,870 --> 00:52:24,369
emanating from me?  What's wrong with you?

977
00:52:24,370 --> 00:52:25,370
You're live...

978
00:52:25,371 --> 00:52:26,371
Oh good, good...

979
00:52:26,372 --> 00:52:30,860
I have to say I have no doubt that this years Big Z Memorial

980
00:52:30,861 --> 00:52:32,812
is just going to be just the best ever.

981
00:52:33,996 --> 00:52:36,273
With the competition just 1 day away

982
00:52:36,274 --> 00:52:40,598
the excitement is definitely building here on Pen Gu Island.

983
00:53:01,508 --> 00:53:04,514
Ah...that didn't take too long, I feel lightheaded.

984
00:53:04,515 --> 00:53:07,758
So get this, on my search for Cody

985
00:53:07,759 --> 00:53:10,285
I bump into my hot tub buddies again.

986
00:53:12,114 --> 00:53:14,071
Oh, I get it, you guys look hungry

987
00:53:14,072 --> 00:53:16,721
yeah, yeah, yeah, you probably got the munchies or something.

988
00:53:16,722 --> 00:53:18,419
Uno momento...

989
00:53:19,896 --> 00:53:22,055
Squidiko, on el stickito?

990
00:53:22,056 --> 00:53:23,056
Hmm? Hmm?

991
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:35,458
Check it out...dude, dude, have you seen my friend Cody?

992
00:53:35,459 --> 00:53:38,466
You know, he's kind of like a penguin umm...

993
00:53:41,832 --> 00:53:43,140
Hey guys, how did you learn how to surf?

994
00:53:43,141 --> 00:53:45,172
I saw Big Z do it, actually.

995
00:53:45,173 --> 00:53:47,438
I don't think you were born yet.

996
00:53:47,439 --> 00:53:48,439
I wasn't?

997
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:49,853
No, I don't think so.

998
00:53:49,854 --> 00:53:53,917
Lani...I like her when she teaches us

999
00:53:53,918 --> 00:53:54,918
because she...

1000
00:53:54,919 --> 00:53:57,127
Muys...not another one!

1001
00:53:57,128 --> 00:53:59,462
I think he really has to go to the bathroom right now.

1002
00:54:00,297 --> 00:54:02,194
Okay, so what's next? The board's done what are we doing?

1003
00:54:02,195 --> 00:54:03,195
Board's done?

1004
00:54:03,196 --> 00:54:04,196
Board's done.

1005
00:54:04,197 --> 00:54:07,055
Oh, well uh, let's do some training, what do you say?

1006
00:54:07,056 --> 00:54:08,056
Finally!

1007
00:54:08,057 --> 00:54:10,381
Hey, can we get a shot of you on your surfboard...

1008
00:54:12,552 --> 00:54:13,876
Hey Z come on!

1009
00:54:15,126 --> 00:54:16,123
Where are you going?

1010
00:54:16,124 --> 00:54:17,309
I thought you said we were going to train.

1011
00:54:17,310 --> 00:54:20,606
Not in the water!  Geez, what are thinking?

1012
00:54:22,331 --> 00:54:24,788
You want to surf like, uh Big Z used to, right?

1013
00:54:24,789 --> 00:54:25,789
Yeah.

1014
00:54:25,790 --> 00:54:28,300
I've got some tests here to figure out your potential.

1015
00:54:28,301 --> 00:54:29,301
Let's do it.

1016
00:54:29,302 --> 00:54:30,302
No, no, no...put them on your eyes.

1017
00:54:30,303 --> 00:54:31,303
Like this...yeah.

1018
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:35,940
[laughs]

1019
00:54:35,941 --> 00:54:36,941
Dig it Cody.

1020
00:54:36,942 --> 00:54:39,825
Can we do some training like, seriously, please?

1021
00:54:39,826 --> 00:54:41,578
What are you talking about, what do you think we're doing?

1022
00:54:41,579 --> 00:54:43,696
We're acting like a bunch of nut jobs, that's what I think we're doing.

1023
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:44,697
Good, good you're learning.

1024
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:45,698
Ahhh!

1025
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:47,925
And a big set comes in!

1026
00:54:49,835 --> 00:54:52,218
Ha, ha, ha...wipe out!

1027
00:54:55,357 --> 00:54:56,427
This is getting ridiculous...

1028
00:54:56,428 --> 00:54:57,428
You having fun?

1029
00:54:57,429 --> 00:54:58,429
I hate you.

1030
00:54:59,654 --> 00:55:04,418
There's a big flow...woo hoo...and he does a flip over the top.

1031
00:55:04,419 --> 00:55:05,419
Alright, now you go.

1032
00:55:08,154 --> 00:55:09,562
No joy man, no joy.

1033
00:55:09,563 --> 00:55:10,563
Fail.

1034
00:55:11,806 --> 00:55:13,231
...I'm starting to see it now...

1035
00:55:13,232 --> 00:55:15,760
Z, I think I know what you're talking about...

1036
00:55:15,761 --> 00:55:17,768
[camera crew is laughing]

1037
00:55:17,769 --> 00:55:20,652
Oh, that's great...as long as we're all having fun, right?

1038
00:55:20,653 --> 00:55:24,466
Z wake up, wake up Z. [snoring]

1039
00:55:24,467 --> 00:55:25,652
Zeeeeeeeee!

1040
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:35,247
Hey Z, breakfast!

1041
00:55:37,596 --> 00:55:38,671
Not a chance!

1042
00:55:40,362 --> 00:55:41,881
You'll have to get up earlier in the morning.

1043
00:55:41,916 --> 00:55:44,330
4, 3, 2, 1...

1044
00:55:47,039 --> 00:55:53,358
[laughing]

1045
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:55,145
That is fun!

1046
00:55:55,146 --> 00:55:56,333
Oh, you're having fun, huh?

1047
00:55:56,334 --> 00:55:57,334
I am yes, now I am.

1048
00:55:57,335 --> 00:56:00,212
Oh, well then, Cody...you pass!

1049
00:56:00,213 --> 00:56:01,213
What?

1050
00:56:01,214 --> 00:56:04,243
You did it, you're ready, let's surf! Come on!

1051
00:56:04,207 --> 00:56:05,642
Z, don't play with me Z...we're surfing?!

1052
00:56:07,050 --> 00:56:07,688
Yes!

1053
00:56:27,715 --> 00:56:29,116
Hey, I didn't know you could surf!

1054
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:36,296
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

1055
00:56:36,297 --> 00:56:40,980
Relax...long, slow, smooth...

1056
00:56:40,981 --> 00:56:41,981
Like making the board!

1057
00:56:41,982 --> 00:56:42,982
There you go.

1058
00:56:42,983 --> 00:56:43,983
Alright, okay...

1059
00:56:43,984 --> 00:56:44,984
Yeah?

1060
00:56:44,985 --> 00:56:45,985
Yeah!

1061
00:56:57,510 --> 00:56:58,621
You're in the water Z!

1062
00:56:58,622 --> 00:57:01,321
Yeah, come on out...get wet, come on!

1063
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:09,368
Lani...thank you.

1064
00:57:13,799 --> 00:57:15,179
Woooooo!

1065
00:57:16,624 --> 00:57:17,434
Look at that!

1066
00:57:30,874 --> 00:57:31,656
Woooooo!

1067
00:57:31,657 --> 00:57:32,657
Nice! That's it!

1068
00:57:32,658 --> 00:57:33,658
Great run!

1069
00:58:00,391 --> 00:58:01,550
Big Z is back!

1070
00:58:01,551 --> 00:58:02,551
Wooooo!

1071
00:58:05,522 --> 00:58:06,311
Woo hoo!

1072
00:58:11,693 --> 00:58:14,785
Ah, this is what it's all about.

1073
00:58:16,461 --> 00:58:17,820
What could be better than this?

1074
00:58:28,007 --> 00:58:32,928
[singing] It's impossible to be down...

1075
00:58:32,929 --> 00:58:33,929
Ah, geez...

1076
00:58:33,930 --> 00:58:45,687
...when you're playing a uuuuuuuuuu...

1077
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:49,022
...I need some help on this Lani for the high note...

1078
00:58:49,023 --> 00:58:52,280
[others join singing]

1079
00:58:52,281 --> 00:58:54,374
Yeah! Nice!

1080
00:58:56,218 --> 00:58:57,580
Is that the only song that you know?

1081
00:58:57,581 --> 00:58:58,911
Pretty much, you want to hear it again?

1082
00:58:58,912 --> 00:58:59,912
No! No, no, no...

1083
00:59:01,126 --> 00:59:02,079
No, okay...

1084
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:04,139
Got you though, didn't I, didn't I, huh?

1085
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:06,682
I must say you were quite amazing out there today.

1086
00:59:07,744 --> 00:59:09,551
You weren't so bad yourself, kiddo.

1087
00:59:09,552 --> 00:59:10,552
Thanks to this guy.

1088
00:59:10,553 --> 00:59:12,841
Nah, I just pointed you in a direction.

1089
00:59:14,495 --> 00:59:15,501
Question, Z...

1090
00:59:15,502 --> 00:59:18,225
Hmmm...you changed your mind about the song...

1091
00:59:18,226 --> 00:59:19,226
No, no, no...

1092
00:59:19,227 --> 00:59:20,227
It goes something like this...

1093
00:59:20,228 --> 00:59:23,048
No, no, no...I was wondering if you'd come watch me ride tomorrow?

1094
00:59:23,049 --> 00:59:29,356
[Z singing]

1095
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:30,357
In the contest...

1096
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:31,358
Contest...what contest?

1097
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:34,281
The Big Z Memorial...remember that one?

1098
00:59:34,282 --> 00:59:39,086
I know, I know I'm asking a lot but it would really really be

1099
00:59:39,087 --> 00:59:42,512
the biggest thing in the world to me if you could come, I mean...

1100
00:59:44,585 --> 00:59:46,282
You still want to be a part of all that, huh?

1101
00:59:46,283 --> 00:59:47,283
Absolutely.

1102
00:59:48,464 --> 00:59:49,875
What do you want me there for anyway?

1103
00:59:49,876 --> 00:59:51,651
I don't know, I thought maybe you'd want to be there

1104
00:59:51,652 --> 00:59:53,500
I mean, I don't know why it's a big deal.

1105
00:59:53,501 --> 00:59:54,501
It's no big deal.

1106
00:59:55,915 --> 00:59:56,834
Why won't you come?

1107
00:59:57,972 --> 00:59:58,780
I'm not coming.

1108
00:59:58,781 --> 00:59:59,781
Why?

1109
00:59:59,782 --> 01:00:00,782
Just give it a rest, will ya?

1110
01:00:00,783 --> 01:00:01,783
[Lani]...it's getting cold guys...

1111
01:00:01,784 --> 01:00:02,784
Can you tell me why you're hiding?

1112
01:00:02,785 --> 01:00:03,785
Hiding?

1113
01:00:03,786 --> 01:00:04,786
Why are you hiding?

1114
01:00:04,787 --> 01:00:05,787
[Lani]...I'm going to have to eat all this by myself...

1115
01:00:05,788 --> 01:00:07,767
Why didn't you come back after you fell off the wave?

1116
01:00:07,768 --> 01:00:08,768
That wave...

1117
01:00:12,995 --> 01:00:18,038
that last day, the winning had become everything to me

1118
01:00:18,039 --> 01:00:19,039
I knew I was going to beat Tank.

1119
01:00:21,223 --> 01:00:26,674
But, then, you know, uh he starts to surf circles around me.

1120
01:00:26,675 --> 01:00:29,780
I saw what he was doing, I couldn't do what he was doing.

1121
01:00:31,192 --> 01:00:32,947
Times had changed, you know he...

1122
01:00:34,651 --> 01:00:37,477
I didn't want to walk back on that beach with all my fans there

1123
01:00:37,478 --> 01:00:39,703
you know, loser, everyone looking at Big Z

1124
01:00:39,704 --> 01:00:41,867
the loser, the has been.

1125
01:00:42,861 --> 01:00:43,934
So...

1126
01:00:49,805 --> 01:00:55,129
Poof! Big Z's dead, and that's how it's going to stay.

1127
01:00:55,130 --> 01:00:57,535
Let me play you that song...

1128
01:00:58,783 --> 01:01:00,453
What about never give up?

1129
01:01:00,454 --> 01:01:02,379
What about find a way?

1130
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:03,380
Yeah, well...

1131
01:01:03,381 --> 01:01:04,723
You're giving up Z, you're giving up.

1132
01:01:04,724 --> 01:01:07,328
Yeah, I'm giving up, that's my way.

1133
01:01:08,367 --> 01:01:09,252
Giving up.

1134
01:01:09,253 --> 01:01:11,085
I thought you were the one guy...

1135
01:01:11,086 --> 01:01:13,711
You don't like it, find your own way.

1136
01:01:16,478 --> 01:01:17,505
Leave me out of it.

1137
01:01:18,919 --> 01:01:19,998
Leave me out of it.

1138
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:20,999
Z !!!

1139
01:01:48,074 --> 01:01:52,236
I messed up, I'm just, I'm not good

1140
01:01:52,237 --> 01:01:55,030
this is when I needed someone, I needed him

1141
01:01:56,825 --> 01:01:59,228
you know, it's hard enough losing one Dad, but...

1142
01:02:00,826 --> 01:02:01,571
What do you mean by that?

1143
01:02:01,572 --> 01:02:02,572
Nothing...

1144
01:02:02,573 --> 01:02:04,885
Nothing man...forget it.

1145
01:02:16,339 --> 01:02:17,851
Whoa!!!!

1146
01:02:17,852 --> 01:02:20,325
[tribe chanting]

1147
01:02:20,326 --> 01:02:22,441
Peace, peace, I come in peace!

1148
01:02:22,442 --> 01:02:23,442
Cody!

1149
01:02:23,443 --> 01:02:24,443
Joe!

1150
01:02:24,444 --> 01:02:25,444
I've been looking everywhere for you!

1151
01:02:25,445 --> 01:02:27,144
Really? You've been looking for me?

1152
01:02:27,538 --> 01:02:30,236
Dude, I didn't lose you on the whale, I'm not going to lose you now.

1153
01:02:30,237 --> 01:02:32,035
Thank you, seriously, thank you.

1154
01:02:32,036 --> 01:02:33,036
Radical.

1155
01:02:33,037 --> 01:02:35,174
[siren sounds]

1156
01:02:35,175 --> 01:02:38,385
Oh! They're starting, Cody we gotta go, come on.

1157
01:02:39,968 --> 01:02:41,390
Joe?  Joe?

1158
01:02:41,391 --> 01:02:44,785
Oh, I'm sorry...watch this dude, I can speak their language...

1159
01:02:44,786 --> 01:02:46,727
Mondo, Koodo, Poongoo

1160
01:02:47,301 --> 01:02:48,155
Ahhh!

1161
01:02:48,156 --> 01:02:51,329
Dude, I totally need my board, I don't even know where it is

1162
01:02:51,330 --> 01:02:53,298
I gotta go find it, I'll see you in the line up then...

1163
01:02:53,299 --> 01:02:54,299
See you Joe...

1164
01:02:59,132 --> 01:03:02,067
The 10th annual Big Z is about to get under way

1165
01:03:02,068 --> 01:03:05,332
and whoa, it is the day of days.

1166
01:03:05,333 --> 01:03:08,701
Big mountainous bombs marching into our coastline

1167
01:03:08,702 --> 01:03:12,872
Kelli Slater, on a danger level, 1 to 10, give me a number.

1168
01:03:13,874 --> 01:03:14,874
Wow, Rob?

1169
01:03:14,875 --> 01:03:15,875
Oh, there'll be blood.

1170
01:03:15,876 --> 01:03:18,177
I'm scared, and I'm in the booth!

1171
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:20,138
What are you doing here?

1172
01:03:20,139 --> 01:03:21,139
Mike...

1173
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:23,643
You're going to kill yourself, please don't do this to yourself, please

1174
01:03:23,644 --> 01:03:25,007
look what happened last time, look...

1175
01:03:25,008 --> 01:03:26,008
Hey, hey, hey!

1176
01:03:26,009 --> 01:03:27,009
It's good to see you back.

1177
01:03:27,010 --> 01:03:28,010
Are you serious?

1178
01:03:28,011 --> 01:03:29,860
You know, you're going to be a real crowd pleaser

1179
01:03:29,861 --> 01:03:32,279
I'm telling ya, these people are going to eat you up.

1180
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:34,669
I'll be expecting big things from you.

1181
01:03:34,670 --> 01:03:35,670
Thank you.

1182
01:03:35,671 --> 01:03:38,433
Hey people, big announcement, Cody Maverick, he's back

1183
01:03:38,434 --> 01:03:40,882
the wipe out king is back and I'm going to tell ya

1184
01:03:40,883 --> 01:03:43,194
start looking for the sharks, they're going to be circling

1185
01:03:43,195 --> 01:03:44,519
'cause there's going to be blood in the water.

1186
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:47,242
Spectacular carnage today, thank you Reggie Bellafonte

1187
01:03:47,243 --> 01:03:49,956
hey, little guy, big hair, big thoughts, big heart...come on.

1188
01:03:58,439 --> 01:04:02,640
Whoa, look at this, you're going down snowflake.

1189
01:04:04,439 --> 01:04:06,523
I'm going to make you wish you were never even hatched.

1190
01:04:08,866 --> 01:04:09,883
You want to see my trophies?

1191
01:04:11,202 --> 01:04:12,586
[siren sounds]

1192
01:04:19,403 --> 01:04:22,191
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Arnold...no.

1193
01:04:28,645 --> 01:04:31,358
There's about 24 surfers battling there way out to the...

1194
01:04:31,359 --> 01:04:35,212
Ewww...good golly, make that 18

1195
01:04:38,818 --> 01:04:41,250
Ralph, after such a heavy wipe out earlier in the week

1196
01:04:41,251 --> 01:04:43,449
what do you think is going through Maverick's mind?

1197
01:04:43,450 --> 01:04:46,993
He's just going to have to stay focused and channel that energy to good places.

1198
01:04:47,766 --> 01:04:49,101
When are you going to get a life?

1199
01:04:51,616 --> 01:04:53,126
You are a nobody.

1200
01:04:54,959 --> 01:04:56,716
You should have stayed in Antartica, kid.

1201
01:05:17,185 --> 01:05:18,824
Cody, Cody, Cody!!!

1202
01:05:18,825 --> 01:05:20,708
Wooo!

1203
01:05:20,709 --> 01:05:22,447
Hey, he made it!

1204
01:05:24,562 --> 01:05:28,150
What an amazing first run, mindblowing for Maverick.

1205
01:05:34,394 --> 01:05:38,435
Did you guys see that?  Oh man, I thought I was going to lose it

1206
01:05:38,436 --> 01:05:43,074
then I just, I just let go you know, I let go and there it was.

1207
01:05:44,705 --> 01:05:49,285
Wow, it's been an amazing day of shredding in less than stellar conditions

1208
01:05:49,286 --> 01:05:52,059
but I never would have guessed our 3 finalists.

1209
01:05:52,060 --> 01:05:57,043
Well, Sal, it's no surprise that Tank Evans has just breezed his way into the finals.

1210
01:05:58,223 --> 01:06:01,833
And, Cody Maverick, from a horrible wipe out a few days ago to this.

1211
01:06:04,932 --> 01:06:07,801
And Chicken Joe from Shaboygan, who would have guessed it?

1212
01:06:08,584 --> 01:06:11,913
I have never seen a finals like this.

1213
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:14,029
We're in the finals, Joe.

1214
01:06:14,030 --> 01:06:15,428
No way, we get to surf some more?

1215
01:06:15,429 --> 01:06:16,429
Isn't it exciting?

1216
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:17,430
Yeah.

1217
01:06:17,431 --> 01:06:19,177
Look at that, ha, ha, this is great, huh?

1218
01:06:19,178 --> 01:06:22,771
Hey, you know, you should know this, Tank loves you.

1219
01:06:22,772 --> 01:06:25,632
Looks like this will be the easiest year ever.

1220
01:06:27,195 --> 01:06:28,559
No way, Cody did you hear that?

1221
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:29,560
This is going to be easy.

1222
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:33,226
Are you loving this?!

1223
01:06:33,227 --> 01:06:35,193
[crowd cheers]

1224
01:06:36,081 --> 01:06:37,863
So who would you like to see win the trophy?

1225
01:06:37,864 --> 01:06:43,517
It's not so important to me...friends are better than anything in the world.

1226
01:06:43,518 --> 01:06:48,553
Friends are forever, trophies, you never know what could happen to them.

1227
01:06:50,203 --> 01:06:51,601
That was awesome...

1228
01:06:51,602 --> 01:06:53,664
Thank you man, thank you bro'.

1229
01:06:53,665 --> 01:06:55,996
Wow, finally...

1230
01:06:55,997 --> 01:06:59,631
Hey, yeah, no, I know, I can't even...

1231
01:06:59,632 --> 01:07:01,501
I know I think I could win this thing.

1232
01:07:01,502 --> 01:07:02,502
It's just, it's too much right now.

1233
01:07:02,503 --> 01:07:04,559
Yeah, well, that's all you came for.

1234
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:05,560
What?

1235
01:07:05,561 --> 01:07:07,114
What was that supposed to mean?

1236
01:07:07,115 --> 01:07:09,217
Uh, you made it pretty clear last night that winning's

1237
01:07:09,218 --> 01:07:10,896
more important to you than Z or me.

1238
01:07:10,897 --> 01:07:11,897
Lani, that's not...

1239
01:07:11,898 --> 01:07:13,710
But, hey, maybe you'll get to take your stupid trophy home.

1240
01:07:13,711 --> 01:07:14,966
Lani...come on!

1241
01:07:14,967 --> 01:07:15,967
Come here, you.

1242
01:07:16,923 --> 01:07:18,796
How 'bout this, huh?  Let me tell you something

1243
01:07:18,797 --> 01:07:22,408
you win this thing, you and me, we're going places, huh?

1244
01:07:22,409 --> 01:07:25,931
Hey, look at this kid...he is a champ.

1245
01:07:36,227 --> 01:07:40,046
Tank, 9 time defending champion...he will roll on you.

1246
01:07:40,047 --> 01:07:41,047
Expect him to win this thing Sal,

1247
01:07:41,048 --> 01:07:42,948
it's basically a contest for second place.

1248
01:07:44,205 --> 01:07:45,785
First I'm going to take you down

1249
01:07:45,786 --> 01:07:47,433
then I'm going to fry the chicken.

1250
01:07:51,330 --> 01:07:54,571
That cloud looks just like kitten, ahh.

1251
01:08:07,373 --> 01:08:09,217
Maverick and Evans take off...

1252
01:08:10,954 --> 01:08:13,058
and it's Evans dropping in.

1253
01:08:16,395 --> 01:08:19,130
Tank's game plan...rocking Maverick's every move

1254
01:08:19,131 --> 01:08:21,204
and Evans takes a rail.

1255
01:08:22,695 --> 01:08:27,361
Tank Evans down, I have never, ever seen this before!

1256
01:08:29,541 --> 01:08:30,977
But I would love to see it again.

1257
01:08:30,978 --> 01:08:34,943
Cody trying to take back the wave that Tank snaked from him.

1258
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:38,476
Evans toying with him not paying attention and there's the outside rail!

1259
01:08:38,477 --> 01:08:42,297
Evans goes down and it's Maverick with this new school move!

1260
01:08:42,298 --> 01:08:44,009
We'll call it The Maverick.

1261
01:08:50,465 --> 01:08:52,779
And look at this, Maverick's scoring big.

1262
01:08:54,574 --> 01:08:59,552
It's so cute, it's got the little paws, the whiskers...whoa

1263
01:09:01,862 --> 01:09:04,048
Chicken Joe with a no paddle drop in...

1264
01:09:06,988 --> 01:09:08,791
nobody needs to help this chicken.

1265
01:09:08,792 --> 01:09:11,206
Woo hoo, I'm flying!

1266
01:09:12,870 --> 01:09:14,555
Maverick and Joe, tied

1267
01:09:14,556 --> 01:09:18,168
and no score for Tank Evans...unbelievable.

1268
01:09:19,545 --> 01:09:22,869
Surfers, this is your final wave.

1269
01:09:23,868 --> 01:09:26,137
Yo man, this is it, this wave wins it, huh?!

1270
01:09:26,138 --> 01:09:27,138
Yeah man!

1271
01:09:30,105 --> 01:09:33,666
This wave is stacking up to be a beautiful tube

1272
01:09:33,667 --> 01:09:37,179
Maverick should score big on this one.

1273
01:09:40,226 --> 01:09:41,907
Wait! Evans drops in

1274
01:09:42,804 --> 01:09:45,256
looks like Evans is going to take out the chicken.

1275
01:09:51,653 --> 01:09:52,684
What's Maverick doing?

1276
01:09:52,685 --> 01:09:53,685
Go Joe, Go!

1277
01:09:53,686 --> 01:09:54,686
Got it!

1278
01:09:54,687 --> 01:09:58,750
I don't believe this, this contest was Maverick's to win

1279
01:09:58,751 --> 01:10:01,428
and now Evans pushing Maverick out of bounds

1280
01:10:01,429 --> 01:10:02,618
and into the boneyards.

1281
01:10:15,825 --> 01:10:17,435
Hey! Look out!

1282
01:10:17,436 --> 01:10:18,436
You look out!

1283
01:10:53,972 --> 01:10:54,917
Hey!

1284
01:10:57,618 --> 01:10:58,256
Z !

1285
01:11:02,798 --> 01:11:03,632
Cody, come on.

1286
01:11:03,633 --> 01:11:04,633
Z !

1287
01:11:04,634 --> 01:11:08,177
Paddle, come on...dig faster, come on...dig, dig!

1288
01:11:09,859 --> 01:11:11,510
Don't dig, don't dig.

1289
01:11:11,511 --> 01:11:12,511
What?

1290
01:11:14,296 --> 01:11:16,165
Let the wave carry you Cody.

1291
01:11:16,166 --> 01:11:17,166
Z !

1292
01:11:17,167 --> 01:11:18,597
You're going to have to time it.

1293
01:11:19,586 --> 01:11:21,935
You're going to come right here, right to me.

1294
01:11:26,124 --> 01:11:27,808
5...4,

1295
01:11:27,809 --> 01:11:29,645
3, 2

1296
01:11:36,294 --> 01:11:36,996
Z !

1297
01:11:51,976 --> 01:11:53,370
Wh...Where's Cody?

1298
01:11:58,591 --> 01:11:59,785
Don't touch it, don't touch that

1299
01:11:59,786 --> 01:12:03,213
this is a reminder of the young surfer

1300
01:12:03,214 --> 01:12:08,811
who gave his life for the sport he loved.

1301
01:12:13,324 --> 01:12:14,341
Ah, there you are...

1302
01:12:21,809 --> 01:12:22,679
I can't believe it!

1303
01:12:24,503 --> 01:12:27,348
You came back, you save my life man.

1304
01:12:27,349 --> 01:12:28,832
Thank you.

1305
01:12:28,833 --> 01:12:31,732
Hey, hey, hey c'mon, c'mon...you're going to tip us.

1306
01:12:34,574 --> 01:12:36,484
Well...I lost.

1307
01:12:36,485 --> 01:12:39,492
Ah, me too.

1308
01:12:41,688 --> 01:12:44,684
[laughs] Come on, let's go loser.

1309
01:12:46,413 --> 01:12:47,459
You want to help me out here?

1310
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:48,460
You know the routine...

1311
01:12:48,461 --> 01:12:53,072
come on, long, yeah, that's it...smooth, you know, come on.

1312
01:12:53,073 --> 01:12:58,118
Young Joey Macinroe was a beacon for a new generation

1313
01:12:58,119 --> 01:13:00,828
may he rest in peace.

1314
01:13:03,217 --> 01:13:06,527
So...we're bidding for the board, who will give me $30, $30, come on.

1315
01:13:06,528 --> 01:13:07,528
Don't touch his stuff, man.

1316
01:13:09,029 --> 01:13:10,046
Hey, hey, hey...

1317
01:13:13,690 --> 01:13:14,460

Yeah, it's me.

1321
01:13:24,739 --> 01:13:26,643
Skank...what's happening, man?

1322
01:13:26,644 --> 01:13:29,353
Got a little sand in you egg sack there fella.

1323
01:13:29,354 --> 01:13:30,354
[crowd laughs]

1324
01:13:30,355 --> 01:13:31,912
Where have you been Z? What happened?

1325
01:13:33,217 --> 01:13:38,060
Oh you know, I uh, I got lost for a little while.

1326
01:13:38,061 --> 01:13:41,141
Uh, but that kid, that kid there, Cody...

1327
01:13:41,142 --> 01:13:44,959
he uh, he pointed the way back.

1328
01:13:51,787 --> 01:13:54,826
Cody, Cody, Cody, Cody...

1329
01:13:56,491 --> 01:13:58,555
Could you please shut that off?  Could you give me a minute?

1330
01:14:04,132 --> 01:14:06,512
Hey, hey check it out, how about this...

1331
01:14:06,513 --> 01:14:09,214
you want to talk about talent scout, people find talent

1332
01:14:09,215 --> 01:14:10,215
I bring them back from the dead!

1333
01:14:11,889 --> 01:14:14,210
The now living legend, ladies and...

1334
01:14:14,211 --> 01:14:15,863
Reggie, shut...shutup.

1335
01:14:15,864 --> 01:14:16,864
What? Shutup?

1336
01:14:16,865 --> 01:14:19,416
I'm not a legend, I'm just a guy looking for some nice waves

1337
01:14:19,417 --> 01:14:20,560
and good friends.

1338
01:14:20,561 --> 01:14:21,561
Ow...

1339
01:14:21,562 --> 01:14:24,691
Hey guys, swell's happening over on the north shore.

1340
01:14:24,692 --> 01:14:26,368
I'm right behind ya, Z.

1341
01:14:26,369 --> 01:14:27,479
Ouch, that hurt.

1342
01:14:30,223 --> 01:14:34,427
Hey, come back here, you don't walk away, come on!

1343
01:14:34,428 --> 01:14:37,090
Folks, it looks like he's taking this loss pretty hard.

1344
01:14:37,091 --> 01:14:39,588
Tank, how's it feel to lose after 9 times...

1345
01:14:42,275 --> 01:14:43,283
I wasn't kissing her...

1346
01:14:43,284 --> 01:14:45,053
you can't have her!

1347
01:14:47,488 --> 01:14:48,873
Guys, guys can we get a few words?

1348
01:14:48,874 --> 01:14:49,874
Hey Ralph.

1349
01:14:49,875 --> 01:14:51,778
So you gave up the trophy to help Joe man...

1350
01:14:51,779 --> 01:14:52,861
what's that about?

1351
01:14:52,862 --> 01:14:55,287
Well, you Rob, that's uh, what friends do.

1352
01:14:55,288 --> 01:14:56,873
How's it feel to win Joe?

1353
01:14:56,874 --> 01:14:58,696
I won?

1354
01:14:59,181 --> 01:15:01,204
Come on...I'm going to tell my Mom!

1355
01:15:03,526 --> 01:15:04,333
Oops.

1356
01:15:07,369 --> 01:15:08,647
Don't you walk away from me

1357
01:15:08,648 --> 01:15:10,622
I am Reggie Bellafonte...

1358
01:15:12,354 --> 01:15:12,919
turn that thing off.

1359
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:15,499
Mikey you are so fired!

1360
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:18,901
I can't imagine a better day!

1361
01:15:25,387 --> 01:15:28,418
Dude...I mean, this whole experience has just been,

1362
01:15:28,419 --> 01:15:30,229
it's amazing.

1363
01:15:30,230 --> 01:15:35,718
Z? I don't think I've ever had a better friend to me

1364
01:15:35,719 --> 01:15:36,719
in my life.

1365
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:41,003
It's just really cool to have everything I need.

1366
01:15:42,041 --> 01:15:42,734
Don't do it!

1367
01:15:42,735 --> 01:15:43,735
Help!

1368
01:15:43,736 --> 01:15:44,736
Oh, Arnold!

1369
01:15:44,737 --> 01:15:48,112
You know, honestly, I'm like kind of bored of talking about myself

1370
01:15:48,113 --> 01:15:49,486
so is that cool?

1371
01:15:49,487 --> 01:15:51,049
You guys got what you need?

1372
01:15:51,050 --> 01:15:52,950
Yeah, yeah...we got it.

1373
01:15:58,005 --> 01:15:59,756
Heyyyyy!

1374
01:16:02,954 --> 01:16:03,709
Cowabunga!

1375
01:17:12,574 --> 01:17:16,552
Oh, of course we're proud of him, what Mother wouldn't be proud?

1376
01:17:16,553 --> 01:17:19,077
We're so full of proudness...

1377
01:17:19,078 --> 01:17:21,894
You know what, he followed his dream and he went out there

1378
01:17:21,895 --> 01:17:24,877
and now he's coming home with the trophy.

1379
01:17:24,878 --> 01:17:26,815
I mean, I can't wait to see the trophy!

1380
01:17:26,816 --> 01:17:28,729
Well, there's not really a trophy...

1381
01:17:30,074 --> 01:17:32,305
Oh, is there like a big shell or something?

1382
01:17:32,306 --> 01:17:35,214
No shell, there's no trophy...well he didn't, he didn't win.

1383
01:17:35,215 --> 01:17:36,215
What?

1384
01:17:37,205 --> 01:17:38,506
How bad, how bad was it?

1385
01:17:38,507 --> 01:17:39,507
I mean did he get smoked?

1386
01:17:39,508 --> 01:17:41,650
He was in the finals...he was in the finals.

1387
01:17:41,651 --> 01:17:43,206
Second place, yeah...that's losing.

1388
01:17:43,207 --> 01:17:44,830
Winning is not everything Glen.

1389
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:47,634
I mean, look at, look at what Cody did.

1390
01:17:47,635 --> 01:17:49,308
Wait, wait go back to the winning isn't everything thing.

1391
01:17:49,309 --> 01:17:52,238
That doesn't compute, really.

1392
01:17:52,239 --> 01:17:53,239
You know what Glen?

1393
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:56,817
I really hope that someday you can be more like Cody.

1394
01:17:58,552 --> 01:17:59,507
This interview's over.
