1
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,130
Good morning!
Anyone else here yet?

2
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:31,400
It's 7:00 am.

3
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,600
I thought the Christmas luncheon
didn't start until lunch.

4
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,170
Well, the early bird
gets the fresh coffee.

5
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,410
Can we help you
with anything?

6
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,140
Oh no. It's ok,
I got it.

7
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,450
Good morning.

8
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,430
mm. Cold coffee,
my favorite.

9
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,330
Do you also have lumpy biscuits
or some very stale crisps?

10
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,100
You will take the caffeine
and you will like it.

11
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:04,130
Are you going home
for Christmas?

12
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,870
So my mum can badger me
about settling down

13
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,700
whilst my cousins play dodgeball
with minced pies?

14
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:09,970
No thanks.

15
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:12,940
I'm headed for Barbados.
What about you?

16
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:14,510
Back to coyote creek.

17
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:17,180
My parents run the local inn and
every year they host a big event

18
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:18,780
the day before Christmas eve.

19
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,680
Last year it was the festival
of lights,

20
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,350
the year before that it was
a Christy Christmas.

21
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,820
Agatha Christy!

22
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,660
A murder mystery party.

23
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,690
Sounds like the type of thing
that'd look killer

24
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:31,960
in your portfolio.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,460
You're going to submit for the
senior planner promotion, right?

26
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,700
Oh, yeah, I guess I should.

27
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,870
That's the logical next step,
right?

28
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,170
Right.

29
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,540
But you don't exactly seem
thrilled about it.

30
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:44,540
I am.

31
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,580
I am.

32
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,210
Andrea.

33
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,650
Are we prepared?

34
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,210
Tell me we are and if we're not,
tell me we are anyway.

35
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,720
Hi, Andrea. Yes, of course,
we are.

36
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:56,850
Good luck, ladies.

37
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:57,990
Oh, Andrea?

38
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,350
Yes, what?

39
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,890
Since it's a luncheon
for the historical society,

40
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,190
I thought we could do

41
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,730
a Christmas through the ages
kind of thing

42
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,160
so I went to the library

43
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,200
and I dug up these antique
Christmas cards.

44
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:10,700
I had them enlarged and printed
on these vinyl placemats

45
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,100
for the table.

46
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:13,740
Fine. Fine, fine.

47
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,380
She really doesn't need to pile
on the praise like that,

48
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:22,080
it's, it's embarrassing.

49
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,550
what are we doing here again?

50
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,220
We have to get uncle jack
a Christmas present

51
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,690
before we go into the office.

52
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,130
Isn't that what malls
are for?

53
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,560
yeah, but we're going
to get him a hotel room

54
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,930
with a king-size bed
and a coffee machine

55
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,900
and Mediterranean omelettes
on demand.

56
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:48,100
It's called a staycation,
and grownups love 'em.

57
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,570
Well, I don't get it.

58
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:52,210
There are way too many places
out there to see.

59
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,110
Like the grand canyon.

60
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,240
I'm so excited for our trip.

61
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,750
Me too.

62
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,980
I'm gonna shout into the abyss
and count how many seconds

63
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:02,280
it takes for my voice
to get back to me.

64
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,420
The abyss?

65
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:04,920
It's my word of the day.

66
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,720
come on.

67
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,610
I know it's a little bit
last minute

68
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,980
but merry Christmas.
It's a hotel stay.

69
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,110
Sweet.

70
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,280
Bluetooth noise cancelling
headphones.

71
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,020
Mm nice, thanks.

72
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:39,790
You didn't think I'd forget

73
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,920
about my favorite nephew,
did you?

74
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,860
I'm your only nephew.

75
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:44,990
True.

76
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,300
No way! A new camera?

77
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,830
I really wanted one of these.

78
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,270
Thank you, uncle jack.

79
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,970
No problem.
Merry Christmas.

80
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,940
Merry Christmas.

81
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:58,340
So, when are you two heading off
for Arizona?

82
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,510
Play it by ear.

83
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:02,010
Think you could add a stop
along the way?

84
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:03,350
What kind of stop?

85
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,850
You sit tight for a minute

86
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,280
while I go talk with uncle jack
in his office?

87
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,550
Oh, ok.

88
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,320
-See you later, kiddo.
-Bye.

89
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,060
A stop in the Rockies?

90
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:20,700
I got a call today from Meyer's
national property group.

91
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,660
They're looking to invest in us.

92
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,800
But they want to see us
diversify our assets.

93
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,870
And this, this is our ticket.

94
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,210
Mom and pop outfit, they've had
great success in the past,

95
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,170
but for some reason
they're thinking of selling.

96
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:33,840
Now, if we can get our hands
on this,

97
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,240
Meyer's national is going
to come on

98
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,350
with extra funding for
future developments.

99
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,650
You want me to scope it out?

100
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,980
Yeah, a quick eval'.

101
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,680
Do we really need this?

102
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,750
To be honest, I'm still
suffering a little jet lag

103
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:49,190
from the last quick eval' in
Alaska and Maine, before that.

104
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:51,030
Was kind of looking forward
to taking a break

105
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,160
and spending some real time
with Noah.

106
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,160
This would be for Noah.

107
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,600
With the investment
from Meyer's national,

108
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,870
you could pare back
on field work.

109
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:05,370
Look, if we don't land
this investment,

110
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:07,510
we're just going to have
to make up for it

111
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,710
with more acquisitions,
more traveling.

112
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,450
Which means even less time
with Noah.

113
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,450
All right, all right, all right.
Let me check with him, ok?

114
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,520
Sure.

115
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,430
<i> -thanks for the picture!</i>

116
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,300
Curve ball.

117
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,200
I'm listening.

118
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:29,730
-Detour.
-Where?

119
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:31,100
-Mountains.
-How long?

120
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,070
A week.

121
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,440
-Five days.
-Five days.

122
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,940
-Grand canyon?
-After.

123
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,870
-Promise?
-Promise.

124
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:39,740
-Deal.
-Deal.

125
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,480
Want to go pocket some
peppermint macaroons for later?

126
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,410
Sure.

127
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:44,450
All right.

128
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,320
hey, mom, what's up?

129
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,960
How did the luncheon go?
Did Andrea like the placemats?

130
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:01,330
Um, yeah, yeah.
It went well.

131
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,330
So, anyway, Christmas is less
than two weeks away

132
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,900
and you still haven't told me
the theme for the party.

133
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,940
<i> The suspense is killing me.</i>

134
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,010
Actually, that's what we wanted
to talk to you about.

135
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:14,240
We were thinking of scaling back
this year.

136
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,580
Scaling back?

137
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,010
<i> Your dad and I,</i>

138
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,080
well, you know, we've been
road tripping a lot lately.

139
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,150
Telluride, durango, and did
we tell you about Wyoming?

140
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,850
Geysers, hot springs and gallons
of chokecherry jam.

141
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,990
<i> Mom.</i>

142
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:31,130
All right, well we sort of
fell behind on Christmas.

143
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,630
Fell behind?

144
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:35,930
This isn't like spring cleaning
or paying the cable bills

145
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,170
or a summer reading list.

146
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,930
This is Christmas
we're talking about here.

147
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,700
And Christmas will
still be Christmas,

148
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:43,040
just a little understated
this year.

149
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:46,840
No, no, understated is not
in the family vocabulary.

150
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,780
<i> Ok, us Parkers we are</i>
<i> all or nothing.</i>

151
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,550
<i> Emphasis on the all.</i>

152
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,820
Ok, how about you let me take
the reins on this one.

153
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,320
I've been wanting
to spruce up

154
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,720
my work portfolio
for a while now

155
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:59,150
and this could be a great
opportunity for me to show

156
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:02,060
that I can do something
on my own for once.

157
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,290
For once? Is there something
wrong at work?

158
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:08,500
No, no, work is great.
Don't change the subject.

159
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:12,400
To go all out or to go all out,
that is the question.

160
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,870
Let's talk about it
when you get here, ok?

161
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:16,910
Fine.

162
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,310
And by the way,

163
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,570
I hope you're ready to drink
your weight in eggnog.

164
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,080
Your father's been experimenting
with home brews.

165
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:25,010
Pumpkin pie's the best flavor
by far.

166
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,580
I like the gingerbread batch.

167
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:30,020
Sounds delicious. I can't wait.
Love you.

168
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,490
-Love you.
-Love you. Bye.

179
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,060
hi!

180
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,900
The Parkers? Back together
again in the same zip code?

181
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,400
It's a miracle.

182
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,870
Oh, mom.

183
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,440
Oh, let me get your bags.

184
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,540
I am so happy to be home.

185
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,410
I'm so glad you're here.

186
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,150
where is our tree?

187
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,080
Dad?

188
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,220
Quinn! I missed you.

189
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,760
We video chatted yesterday.

190
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,730
I still missed you.

191
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,090
Julie!

192
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:46,730
Welcome home, Paige.

193
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,330
I hear you're trying
to talk your parents

194
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,500
out of this ridiculous notion
of scaling back Christmas.

195
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,100
Mmmhmm.

196
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,900
Hi, Paige. Good to have
you back.

197
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,340
Where are we on the whole

198
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,970
knocking some Christmas sense
into your parents thing?

199
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,510
We are getting there.

200
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:03,310
Mmmm.

201
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,690
this is so cool.

202
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,790
Yeah. Can see almost the whole
world from up here, right?

203
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:21,100
Actually, not the whole world,
but as far as the eye can see.

204
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:23,870
Which is still pretty far.

205
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,270
Whoever thought I'd be raising
the next Andy Warhol?

206
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:31,270
I'm more of an Ansel Adams.
He does landscapes.

207
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,690
They'll come around, right?

208
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,050
Let's just put it this way,

209
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,390
when everyone else is
bulk-buying hot chocolate

210
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,860
and holiday cards,

211
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:50,060
your parents are buying
hiking boots

212
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,830
and taking notes off
the travel channel.

213
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:52,690
Yeah.

214
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,860
I think they just want
to put their energy

215
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,330
into a different direction
for a change.

216
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:58,530
No, and I get that, I do.

217
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:01,140
That's why I said I would
do all the work.

218
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:02,870
You know, last year I convinced
jimmy fleet

219
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:05,710
to come out of retirement for
a Christmas concert in Denver.

220
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,810
The hall of famer?

221
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,380
Yeah. And do you know
how hard it is

222
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:10,480
to get an ex-rock star
to sing jingle bells.

223
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,080
So if I can do that,
I can do anything.

224
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:14,050
Hey, Paige, Quinn.

225
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,250
Hey, Mia. Did you just
have a gig?

226
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,090
Yeah. It was awesome.

227
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:21,720
Although somebody put a cheese
danish in my tip jar.

228
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,430
I think they took the whole
starving artist thing literally.

229
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,170
well, I better get going.

230
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,570
My mom has a holiday itinerary

231
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,340
and if I am late for Christmas
cocktail hour,

232
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:36,740
I'll never hear the end of it.

233
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:39,010
Mistletoe martinis
wait for no one.

234
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,410
Exactly.

235
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,040
Well, I'll see you guys later.

236
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,440
-Bye!
-Bye.

237
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,350
Ok, I know you're doing
the whole play it cool thing,

238
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,920
but that was just
straight-up cold.

239
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,790
You didn't say one word
to her?

240
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,020
Oh yeah, like I woke up
this morning and was like,

241
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,020
you know what would be great?

242
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,390
Running into Mia

243
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:57,260
and forgetting every word
in the English language.

244
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,730
You know, in fact,
that was so much fun,

245
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,560
let's do it again tomorrow.

246
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,930
Quinn...

247
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,200
Mia's been coming to the inn
since the dawn of time

248
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,630
and do you know
who she raves about

249
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,200
in her yelp review every year?
You.

250
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,740
I mean, it's actually,

251
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:11,470
it's physically painful to watch
two smart people be so dumb.

252
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:14,940
Well, I mean, between the inn
and volunteering at the library

253
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:18,810
and plowing my way through
the last year of grad school,

254
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,650
I don't really have time
for dating anyway.

255
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,250
Yeah, but it's such a romantic
time of year, isn't it?

256
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:27,920
Cozying up by a fire
with some hot cocoa, mistletoe?

257
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,220
Are you kidding?

258
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,730
When was the last time
you welcomed

259
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,100
even an ounce of romance
into your life?

260
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:38,270
Right now, when I fell in love
with my coffee all over again.

261
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:49,310
we'll send that up right away.

262
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,450
The Andersons would like
more shampoo.

263
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,020
Mrs. Alvarez has requested
an 8:00 wakeup call

264
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:58,790
and Mr. Tenaka was wondering
if we could extend breakfast
until 11:00 tomorrow.

265
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,660
-Not a problem.
-Great.

266
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,930
-Hi there.
-Hi.

267
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,860
What can we do for you?

268
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:10,300
I'm Dylan bailey, bailey
brothers development company.

269
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,870
This is my son, Noah.

270
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,870
Uh, are you rick
and Linda Parker?

271
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,300
That's us.

272
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,510
Excellent. I believe you spoke
with my brother, jack.

273
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,010
Ah.

274
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,140
Well, yes, but we weren't
expecting you until next month.

275
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:25,110
The email said January 17th.

276
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:28,020
I'm sorry, but jack told me
it was this month.

277
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:29,820
Do you want me
to come back?

278
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,190
No, no, no. You've already made
the drive up.

279
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,890
I'll be in and out
before Christmas, I promise.

280
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:38,690
Great. Let's just get you
checked in, Mr. Bailey.

281
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,060
Just call me Dylan.

282
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:44,530
Dylan, um, our daughter
just came up from the city

283
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,570
and she doesn't know
we're planning on selling,

284
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,040
because we were going to wait
until after Christmas,

285
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:50,300
but since you're here now.

286
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:53,170
I was wondering if you wouldn't
mind doing your evaluations,

287
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:55,710
maybe, under the radar?

288
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,980
You know, just until we can find
a moment to tell her?

289
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:03,350
Uh, sure.

290
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:06,150
Thank you. Thank you.

291
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:07,560
Yeah.

292
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:10,760
Hey, Noah.
Come on, bud.

293
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:12,760
So, what's first
on the agenda?

294
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,760
-A structural-
-swashbuckling!

295
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:17,170
let me guess,
word of the day?

296
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,330
Yes, sir.

297
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:20,400
What exactly does
swashbuckling entail?

298
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:25,740
I don't know exactly, but
I do know we'll need fuel.

299
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:28,880
Sounds like you could use some
famous coyote creek hot cocoa.

300
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:32,050
Point the way, and let
the swashbuckling begin.

301
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,860
Brace yourselves.

302
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:46,060
Ok, so I know it's way late
in the game

303
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,760
and I know you have other things
you're focusing on,

304
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,300
I totally get it, but I just,

305
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,030
I really think that we need this
Christmas party.

306
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,100
Ok.

307
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:53,940
What?

308
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:55,540
Ok.

309
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:57,210
Really?

310
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,910
'cause I mean I had a whole
speech prepared.

311
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,710
I didn't even get to
the chronological breakdown

312
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,310
of every Parker Christmas
since the '90s.

313
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,150
Well, I hope you weren't going
to mention '99, when you...

314
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,220
ahem. Moving on.

315
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,780
Right.

316
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,490
So, what's the theme?

317
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,490
Huh.

318
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:23,830
All right. Now, before we begin,
Julie, George...

319
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,170
It'll be easier for you two
to listen in here.

320
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,670
Are you implying that
we're eavesdropping?

321
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,670
'cause we most certainly...

322
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,910
Were.

323
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,310
come on.

324
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,910
All right. Now, who has an idea
for the theme?

325
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:40,450
How about valentine's day?

326
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,580
Because at this rate that's
when we'll be ready.

327
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,950
Hey, you are not helping.
Anyone else?

328
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:47,790
How about the cast of Christmas,
where each guest dresses up

329
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,320
as their favorite
Christmas character?

330
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,430
Do we really want an
over-confident risk taker

331
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:54,330
showing up as krampus?

332
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,930
Actually, I would love that.

333
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,170
Christmas carol-oke.

334
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,840
Also known as how many times
can you hear

335
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,970
your favorite Christmas song
before you hate it?

336
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:05,270
Hey! What did I say to you
about not helping?

337
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:06,710
Fine.

338
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,440
Uh, Christmas pajama party?

339
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,680
Ooh.

340
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,480
Hm. Linda just got me
a new deep v flannel set

341
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,950
that I've been itching
to wear.

342
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,480
You guys don't mind a little
bit of chest hair, do you?

343
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:14,980
Dad!

344
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:15,880
Oh, la, la.

345
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,790
Ugh, mom!

346
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:28,060
that's it!

347
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:30,870
We're gonna host a how
to learn Swedish seminar?

348
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,800
Icelandic, but no.

349
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:36,640
Mom, dad, every year people
come here from all over, right?

350
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:37,670
Mm-hm.

351
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,140
So many customs and cultures

352
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,380
right under our nose and
we don't celebrate any of it.

353
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:44,910
So, what about Christmas eve
around the world?

354
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:48,850
A giant feast that combines

355
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:51,020
recipes and traditions
from all over.

356
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,220
I love it.

357
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,990
You had me at giant feast.

358
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,390
We're in.

359
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,190
Why not.

360
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:02,330
That's the spirit.
Great, ok!

361
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:06,900
Now, speaking of tradition,
I'm off to find myself a marmot.

362
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,100
Check the gazebo.

363
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:21,450
Well, are you ready for this?

364
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,380
The last Christmas
at coyote creek?

365
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:27,090
Shh. We don't have to think
about that right now.

366
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:31,530
hm.

367
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:41,870
-Look at all these presents!
-Yeah.

368
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,810
-Lose something?
-No.

369
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,640
So, what are you doing?

370
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:54,120
I'm looking for... Charlotte!

371
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:54,980
Urgh!

372
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,750
A giant squirrel?

373
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:01,120
No, not a squirrel.

374
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,960
You must not be
from around here.

375
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,830
Everyone knows
Charlotte the marmot.

376
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:06,960
Why is she dressed up?

377
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,600
It's Christmas tradition.
Our town mascot is the marmot.

378
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,800
I know it's a pretty silly thing

379
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,070
for a town called
coyote creek, huh?

380
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:18,810
But every December we take turns
hiding her all around town

381
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,340
and every time we find her,
you have to add another piece

382
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:24,350
of Christmas clothing and then
hide her somewhere new.

383
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,110
That sounds like fun.

384
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:28,650
Maybe if you stick around long
enough you'll find her yourself.

385
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,620
We're only in town for
a few days on business.

386
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:33,290
I thought it might be a nice
holiday getaway from the city.

387
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,760
Oh, you're from Denver?
I live there too.

388
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,360
I come home every year
for Christmas.

389
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:40,960
My parents run the local inn
and I grew up there.

390
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,760
The coyote creek inn?

391
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,130
Yep, that's the one.

392
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,100
We're staying there.

393
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,040
So you must be one of
the Parkers?

394
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,800
Yeah, I'm Paige.

395
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,210
Their daughter?

396
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:55,210
Yeah, yeah, they run the inn.
Didn't we just do this?

397
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:01,150
Yeah, sorry. I'm Dylan
and this is my son, Noah.

398
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,880
Well, it's nice to meet
you both.

399
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:05,220
I guess I'll see you
around then.

400
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:07,290
Yeah, yeah, I guess so.

401
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:09,990
Ok.

402
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,540
Ok, so first things first,

403
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:24,410
and I can't believe I even
have to say this,

404
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,140
but we need a Christmas tree
for the lobby,

405
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:28,340
so I will head down to
Pete's pines this morning.

406
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,210
Mm-hm.

407
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,880
Next comes the menu,
the decorations, the music.

408
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,820
For this part we should probably
do some research

409
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,550
on Christmas traditions
around the world.

410
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:37,990
Mm-hm.

411
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:41,520
Lastly, flyers, evites,
social media, the whole shebang.

412
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,560
Get the word out to as many
people as possible.

413
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,860
Wow, ok.

414
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,900
Good morning, Paige.

415
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,730
Well, good morning, Noah.

416
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:54,370
What are you up to today?

417
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,940
Actually, I was just on my way
to get a Christmas tree.

418
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:00,740
But not just any Christmas tree,
the perfect Christmas tree.

419
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,740
What makes the perfect
Christmas tree?

420
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,380
Seven and a half feet tall,
fifty inches in base diameter,

421
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:10,280
one-inch needles, extra full,
freshly cut.

422
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:13,120
-Oh, wow.
-I know.

423
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:15,860
And here I thought you were
gonna set unrealistic standards.

424
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,730
Can we come?

425
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,300
Oh, well-

426
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,200
I don't think we have time, bud.

427
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,030
Please? Please?

428
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,240
Ok.

429
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,390
no, no.

430
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:57,000
I know what you're thinking.

431
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,270
Do you?

432
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,830
Yeah, your expression
wasn't exactly subtle.

433
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,840
You're thinking that
I'm too rigid or critical

434
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,070
or high maintenance

435
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,810
or whatever other word
gets slapped onto women

436
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,910
who believe in setting
high standards

437
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,310
and making plans
to achieve them.

438
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:12,480
I was thinking that this just
seems like a lot of trouble

439
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,520
for just a Christmas tree.

440
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,420
Oh.

441
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:19,250
No. There's no "just"
when it comes to Christmas.

442
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:20,960
Every little thing,
every ornament,

443
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:24,290
every cinnamon stick,
every bouquet and wreath.

444
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:27,090
Every cranberry scented candle
contributes to the magic.

445
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:28,200
It all matters.

446
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:32,530
Agree to disagree...
Strongly disagree.

447
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,140
Do you lack social
graces entirely

448
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:37,300
or just when it comes
to strangers?

449
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,640
Oh, entirely.

450
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,670
Noah's the only one
that can stand me.

451
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:43,610
Just you two?

452
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:44,850
Yeah.

453
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,980
Yeah, his mom's not around.

454
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:54,020
Hey, Paige.
What about this one?

455
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,790
Oh, let's see.

456
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,360
Hm.

457
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,040
It's not the perfect tree?

458
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,170
You know what,

459
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:15,180
I forgot to tell you the most
important thing

460
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:16,340
about picking out
a Christmas tree.

461
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,580
What?

462
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:20,080
You want the ornament
to hang straight, right?

463
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:23,180
Sheered trees or long needles
set the ornament at an angle

464
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,320
and no one wants a blown glass
keepsake ornament

465
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,390
sliding off and shattering
into a millions pieces.

466
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,090
Believe me, I have
been there.

467
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:33,190
So, let's see.

468
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,100
see? It is perfect.

469
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:42,170
Yeah.

470
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:55,880
well, thanks for letting us
tag along today.

471
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,050
Sure.

472
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,020
Hey, Noah, you wouldn't
be interested

473
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,260
in helping us decorate the tree,
would you?

474
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:04,430
I definitely would!

475
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,260
I mean, yeah, if you want,
I could do that.

476
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,970
That ok?

477
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,570
Yeah, yeah. I actually have
some work to do,

478
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,800
so if you don't mind.

479
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:16,540
No, not at all.

480
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,320
He is kind of handsome,
don't you think?

481
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:31,090
I mean, he's not my type,
but...

482
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,950
Is he?
I... I hadn't noticed.

483
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:36,960
let's get decorating!

484
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:38,560
I definitely like
that one.

485
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:41,230
And that one in the box
is pretty good too.

486
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:46,500
I had glitter stuck in
my eyebrows for weeks.

487
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:48,940
-Yikes.
-I know.

488
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:51,170
Do you have a favorite
Christmas ornament back home?

489
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,640
Actually, we don't normally have
a Christmas tree.

490
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,280
Oh.

491
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,810
We're usually traveling.

492
00:22:56,850 --> 00:23:00,950
Lake Tahoe, mount Rushmore,
San Diego.

493
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,620
I've been to 23 states.

494
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:05,150
Wow, that's impressive.

495
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:07,150
Does your dad travel
a lot for work?

496
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:08,520
Sometimes.

497
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,990
But, a lot of the time we're
just doing it for fun.

498
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:12,130
Huh.

499
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,960
Christmas in hotels
and hammocks, huh?

500
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,200
Well, sort of.

501
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,970
We're men of simple tastes.

502
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,040
Just give us the open road and
gas stations with good snacks.

503
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,510
-Good snacks are essential.
-Uh-huh.

504
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:32,810
Ready?

505
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:33,850
Ready.

506
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:39,850
Woah!

507
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:41,990
You can say that again.

508
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,020
Woah.

509
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:55,370
you know what they say,

510
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,470
all work and no play
makes jack a lifeless cog

511
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:00,540
in the capitalist machine.

512
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,240
Thank you.

513
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:04,680
It does sound familiar.

514
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,680
All this land yours?

515
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,750
Yep.

516
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,680
Nearly 30 acres.

517
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,990
Seem like you could do a lot
with that much land.

518
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,320
Yeah, Linda and I had a few
plans for additions,

519
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:21,560
but this place is hard enough
to keep up as it is.

520
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,200
We don't want to bite off
more than we could chew.

521
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,270
Well, I'm just about done
out here.

522
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,170
You mind pulling
the finances together

523
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:31,570
for me to take a look at?

524
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:34,740
Mortgage details,
rental income, gross yield.

525
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,110
Sure.

526
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:43,180
Now, what do you say
we rejoin the others?

527
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,380
Truthfully, I've never really
been any good

528
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,790
at that sort of thing.

529
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,920
More of a Halloween guy, huh?

530
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,120
Ah, I just never really
liked anything

531
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:54,800
that was too... Well, that.

532
00:24:56,530 --> 00:25:02,540
well, unfortunately we got
a lot of "that" up here.

533
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:06,310
You'd be surprised the effect
this place has on people.

534
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,610
Thankfully I think I'll be
long gone

535
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,110
by the time it can get me.

536
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,280
-I'll see you in there.
-Yeah.

537
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:25,560
Ok, what do you think?
A boa or suspenders?

538
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,900
-Suspenders.
-Yeah.

539
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:29,630
<i>These things</i>
<i> come in handy</i>

540
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:31,430
<i> if you need a last-minute</i>
<i> costume for a Christmas party.</i>

541
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,470
<i>Yeah.</i>

542
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:38,970
Dad, look. Isn't it
totally awesome?

543
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:41,510
Yeah. Totally.

544
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:44,010
Paige was just telling me about
all the cool Christmas things

545
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,680
they do around here.

546
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:48,980
A Christmas card-a-thon,
homemade cookies and eggnog,

547
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,590
and a huge Christmas party.

548
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,350
Christmas eve eve party.

549
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:56,290
Ah, that sounds pretty great.

550
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:58,530
Maybe we can stay a little
longer in coyote creek

551
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:00,530
than we planned?

552
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,000
Yeah, maybe.

553
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:24,850
-oh, it's you.
-It is me.

554
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:27,050
Why is it you?

555
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,060
I mean, what... What are you
doing here?

556
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:32,360
Same as you.

557
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:33,560
You're looking for information

558
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:35,230
on long-standing global
Christmas traditions

559
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,700
and unique cultural
culinary delights?

560
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:41,000
Yeah. Crazy, right?

561
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,210
where's Noah?

562
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:54,210
Oh, I lost him to
the photography section.

563
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:56,250
Those all for
the Christmas party?

564
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,720
Yeah.

565
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:00,750
Yeah, it's a Christmas around
the world kind of thing.

566
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,190
A big feast meant

567
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,720
to celebrate all the different
Christmas traditions,

568
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,360
but honestly it's a little
overwhelming.

569
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,730
I don't even know how to choose
between some of these.

570
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:13,530
Um, do I go with Italy's octopus
salad or pierogi from Poland?

571
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:17,370
Well, what about
pfeffernusse cookies?

572
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:20,070
Feffer the what now?

573
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:22,380
Pfeffernusse, they're German.

574
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:24,010
They're made with spices
and molasses

575
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:25,050
and covered in confectioner's
sugar.

576
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,450
Mm.

577
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,880
Noah and I spent Christmas
in Munich three years ago

578
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,220
and, let me tell you,

579
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:32,220
I must have eaten 20 of those
in under an hour.

580
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:34,860
And by 20 I mean 30.

581
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:37,420
Yeah, well they do
sound delicious.

582
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,560
Hm. Maybe I'll stop by
the bakery.

583
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,030
Woah, Woah, Woah there
cookie thief.

584
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,300
Excuse me?

585
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:44,770
Well, you don't get to steal
my cookie idea

586
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,630
and then also not take me.

587
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,370
Fine, fine. We'll both go
to the bakery then.

588
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:52,940
-Fine.
-Fine.

589
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:56,980
We're going to the bakery?
Dibs on the biggest cookie!

590
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:07,420
All right, I gotta know,
what's with the marmots?

591
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:11,120
The town of coyote creek
began in the winter of 1858

592
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,990
with just a single log cabin
built by hank Odell.

593
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:16,100
There's actually a really great
stone monument

594
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:18,170
in a pavilion dedicated to him

595
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,970
and every year the town hosts
a Santa's workshop

596
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,670
at the pavilion every Christmas.

597
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:25,070
Anyway, when hank was setting up
his first Christmas tree,

598
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:27,810
he realized he didn't have
any lights or decorations.

599
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,610
Over the course
of the next few days

600
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:32,680
all these random objects
started appearing on his porch.

601
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:36,450
Flower petals, twigs,
pine cones, you name it.

602
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:38,490
And it was these marmots
who were bringing him

603
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:42,090
like tokens of gratitude because
he'd unknowingly scared away

604
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,620
all the coyotes who'd never seen
a human before.

605
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,260
But, on Christmas eve,

606
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,960
he received the biggest
surprise of all.

607
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,500
A 12-ounce gold nugget
on his porch

608
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:55,370
that the marmots found by
burrowing into the river bed.

609
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,770
-Wow.
-I know.

610
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:00,140
Sort of became tradition
for the townspeople to leave

611
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:03,180
small gifts at Christmas time on
the porches of their neighbors.

612
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:04,810
I mean, most of us aren't
carrying around

613
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:08,380
12-ounce gold nuggets,
but you get the idea.

614
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,790
here we are.

615
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:19,990
-Ah! Merry Christmas, Paige.
-Merry Christmas.

616
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:21,230
Do you want the usual?

617
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,060
Actually yes, I do, but
that's not why I'm here.

618
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:24,330
Oh.

619
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:26,570
-Peppermint fudge.
-Thank you.

620
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,800
And we'll take two more
for these gentlemen

621
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,500
whose lives have yet to be
forever changed

622
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,840
by your edible excellence.

623
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,340
here you go.

624
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,380
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

625
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:38,850
-Hm.
-Thank you.

626
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,580
Well?

627
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:47,390
Mmm. This is...

628
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,320
Delectable!

629
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:51,390
man, you are killing it
with these word of the days.

630
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:52,690
I know, right?

631
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:54,860
-I know.
-Yeah.

632
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,060
So what's up, hon?

633
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,760
Well, this year I'm taking
the reins

634
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,030
on the inn's Christmas party

635
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:00,370
and I thought maybe
you could help me

636
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,900
with some of the desserts.

637
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:04,740
The menu is gonna consist of
dishes from all over the world

638
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:09,580
and Dylan here recommended
fa.. Fifenu..

639
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:11,210
Pfeffernusse cookies.

640
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:14,280
Yes, of course.
German, right?

641
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,420
Yeah, that's right.

642
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:17,250
Great choice.

643
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:21,020
The key ingredient
is anise seeds or extract

644
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,460
to get that licorice flavor.

645
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,020
And black pepper.

646
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:27,190
It's that hint of the spice
that's what makes it distinct.

647
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:29,030
A man who knows
his seasoning.

648
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,300
Anyway, you know I'd love
to help out hon,

649
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:34,630
but I'm pretty backed up
on holiday orders.

650
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,140
Christmas pageants,
office parties.

651
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:40,140
Thirty-six hours to make nearly
300 Christmas cookies.

652
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:41,040
Ahh!

653
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,980
Well, what if I were to help you
with the orders?

654
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:47,980
I'm no pastry chef but I am
a decorating dynamo.

655
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:50,380
I don't know.

656
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,620
I can help too.
Can I?

657
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:57,320
Well...

658
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,260
All right then.

659
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:09,800
operation Christmas cookies
enlists another soldier.

660
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,640
Come back tomorrow, 8:00.

661
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:13,910
-Deal!
-Deal.

662
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,510
Enjoy.

663
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,320
See you tomorrow morning,
Paige.

664
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,960
See you tomorrow.

665
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:36,300
-You got a good one.
-Yeah, yeah I did.

666
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:38,800
Not sure what I did
to deserve him.

667
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,870
Are you always this hard
on yourself?

668
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:44,100
Yeah, one of my defining
characteristics actually.

669
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,610
That and being really,
really, charming.

670
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,310
Oh, don't forget your
incredible modesty.

671
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,180
I'll see you tomorrow.

672
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:52,310
Really?

673
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:54,110
Well, yeah.

674
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:55,520
You didn't think I was going
to let Noah have all the fun,
did you?

675
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:57,050
Well, I just didn't peg you
as someone

676
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,790
who wants to bake 300 Christmas
cookies on a tight deadline

677
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:02,060
and at the risk of early
onset arthritis.

678
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,890
That's not why I'll show up.

679
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:07,290
Hey dad, are you coming
or what?

680
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:09,500
We're almost at
the Annie Leibovitz

681
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:10,830
chapter of this podcast

682
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:12,870
and I don't really want
to keep explaining to you

683
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,500
what you missed.

684
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:16,300
okay, okay.

685
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:40,190
cinnamon sugar, butter,
fresh dough.

686
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:41,530
You're cheating on me.

687
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,230
with Sarah's sweets!

688
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,900
Oh, George, you have
to forgive me.

689
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:48,070
The fudge, the fudge.

690
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,570
Oh.

691
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,840
So, I have a culinary mission
for you,

692
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:53,870
should you choose to accept.

693
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:55,380
-Let's hear it.
-Ok.

694
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:58,010
I've compiled a list of popular
Christmas dishes

695
00:32:58,050 --> 00:33:00,380
from around the world
for the feast.

696
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:03,120
We have puerto rican
roast pig,

697
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:06,420
french guinea fowl roasted
and stuffed with chestnuts,

698
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:09,690
Venezuelan hallacas,
danish boiled potatoes.

699
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:12,260
And Sara's gonna try to help
with some of the desserts.

700
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:15,100
German cookies,
Slovakian honey cake,

701
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:18,900
pavlova, Filipino bibingka
and I have to stop

702
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:21,130
because my mouth is
literally watering.

703
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,140
Ok. Well, that sounds great...

704
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:24,200
But?

705
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,810
But, and just hear me out
on this,

706
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:28,070
it just feels like if the goal
is to celebrate

707
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:30,710
the many Christmas traditions
of our guests,

708
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,910
you might want to talk
to our guests.

709
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:36,080
Oh. Thank you.

710
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,050
There you go.

711
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:40,050
Ok, I'm gonna go back to work.

712
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:49,430
mm. Genius. I'm a genius.

713
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,830
Well, the property's
in good shape

714
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,270
and they're sitting
on a lot of land,

715
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,070
but their finances are
a bit confusing.

716
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,570
Confusing how?

717
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,240
<i> Profits have been increasing</i>
<i> year after year.</i>

718
00:33:57,270 --> 00:34:00,170
Why sell if business
is booming?

719
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,080
<i> Hm. That is odd.</i>

720
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,680
But the why doesn't
matter to us.

721
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,580
They are selling
and that's that.

722
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,680
Any more word from
Meyer's national?

723
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,950
<i> Yeah, about that,</i>

724
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:11,450
before they come on board
with an investment

725
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:13,450
they want to see plans
for a redesign.

726
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:15,320
Of the inn? Why?

727
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,860
We need to show them
what we can do

728
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:17,860
on the development side,

729
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,790
not just on the
acquisition side.

730
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:23,300
Show what sets us apart
from the other firms.

731
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:25,870
<i> So go ahead and draw up</i>
<i> the blueprints for the future.</i>

732
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:31,040
The future bailey brothers
luxury resort and ski lodge.

733
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:33,210
Hm. So when you said redesigning
you really meant

734
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,880
bulldozing it to the ground
and rebuilding it entirely?

735
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,940
<i> I'm sure the Parkers</i>
<i> will love that.</i>

736
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:03,740
♪ ho, ho, ho,
who wouldn't go, ♪

737
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:07,570

740
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,090

741
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:20,890
Oh, sorry.

742
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,960
What did you say?

743
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,060
Nothing, it's...

744
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:25,060
I, I just didn't,
I didn't hear you.

745
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:26,430
You sound great.

746
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,460
Thanks.

747
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:31,460
Ok.

748
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,440
-like that.
-Ok.

749
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:45,550
Am I doing this right?

750
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:46,480
I don't think I'm doing
this right.

751
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,920
it's Christmas cookies,
not cubism.

752
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:52,050
Just be creative,

753
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:53,790
but don't draw like
a treasure map

754
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,620
or write Morse code.

755
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,590
Ok. No Morse code,
got it.

756
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:58,630
What about Italian?

757
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,090
Hm.

758
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:02,130
Dov'è la paninoteca?

759
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,800
Did you just ask me where
the sandwich shop is?

760
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,570
You speak Italian?

761
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,800
Si, ho imparato un poco.

762
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,600
I learned a little when
my company hosted a dinner

763
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,310
for Denver university's
foreign exchange students.

764
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:17,240
Sorry.

765
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:20,150
I didn't know you had
a company.

766
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:22,850
Oh, no, not my company.
Just the company I work for.

767
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,980
I'm an event planner.

768
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:24,980
Oh, that sounds exciting.

769
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,250
Hm.

770
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:28,320
So is it like, masquerade balls
and galas or,

771
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,020
or luncheons for tech moguls
and antique dealers?

772
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:32,830
Oh, a little bit of everything,

773
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,990
but honestly, it's not
as exciting as all that.

774
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:37,300
It's mostly painting
by numbers,

775
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:41,130
coloring inside the lines,
paying attention to detail.

776
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:42,870
Which I'm good at.

777
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,100
I can see that.

778
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:46,510
Thanks.

779
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:53,550
Come on, go crazy.
It's therapeutic.

780
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,180
Ok, fine.

781
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:00,290
Oh, like you mean it.

782
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,860
and, for the record?
I like it better that way.

783
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,300
Whew! That was record time.

784
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,970
I'll get started on that list
of desserts

785
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:21,170
just as soon as I get done
with these deliveries.

786
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:23,340
Thank you so much, Sara.
I appreciate it.

787
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:26,050
I know. See ya later!

788
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,210
-Bye!
-Bye.

789
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:33,390
Do you think there's a bakery
at the grand canyon?

790
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:36,520
Not like, in the canyon,
but near it.

791
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,760
Probably.

792
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:40,530
There must be something
near the hotel. Why?

793
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,760
Sara was telling me about

794
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:43,760
all the different types
of Christmas cookies.

795
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:47,230
Drop cookies, blossom cookies,
rolled cookies,

796
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:50,840
pressed cookies, bar cookies,
and snowballs.

797
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:52,440
I want to try them all.

798
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:55,440
Sounds like a man
on a mission.

799
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,380
so grand canyon, huh?

800
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:07,690
Yeah, it's a national park
with geologic strata

801
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,460
from the Proterozoic
and Paleozoic eras.

802
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:12,360
You should check it
out sometime.

803
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,390
I know what it is,

804
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:16,100
what I don't know is
why you seem to want

805
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:18,900
to spend Christmas anywhere
but home?

806
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:22,070
Noah told me about the whole
jack Kerouac on the road thing.

807
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:22,940
Ah.

808
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:27,070
What is home anyways?

809
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:30,740
A place where you feel safe
and loved that welcomes you back

810
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:32,810
no matter how long
you've been gone.

811
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,280
Ok.

812
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,950
Why does home have
to be somewhere,

813
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,880
why can't it be someone?

814
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,920
For me, home is simple.

815
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,760
It's not a bad thing, you know.

816
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:44,760
What?

817
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:46,790
Having actual emotions.

818
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:51,960
Ok, so I know two things
about you.

819
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,930
You are not great
at cookie decorating

820
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:56,740
and you don't like to talk
about anything serious,

821
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:59,840
which I had to infer
from your brooding silence.

822
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:01,610
-I'm not brooding.
-Mmm.

823
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,910
I'm maintaining an air
of mystery.

824
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:06,180
People like mysteries,
don't they?

825
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,180
All right, fine.

826
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:11,780
I really hate olives.
Now you know three things.

827
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,090
Come on, seriously?

828
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,950
No, seriously.
I really hate em'.

829
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:21,790
-Bye, Paige!
-Bye.

830
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:24,830
-See ya.
-Yeah.

831
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,170
What?

832
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:35,270
Oh, nothing, nothing.

833
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:38,010
I was just wondering if all the
guests get a private tour guide

834
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:41,850
or just the handsome
single dads.

835
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,280
We were helping Sara
with a huge Christmas order

836
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,950
so she could help me
with the feast.

837
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:49,190
A strictly selfish motive
on my part.

838
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,360
Mm-hm.

839
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:53,390
Ok, can I please see
the guestbook?

840
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,890
I want to talk to some
of the guests

841
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,030
about their Christmas
traditions.

842
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,360
Mmm.

843
00:39:58,530 --> 00:39:59,870
Thank you.

844
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:07,070
The Christmas holidays last from
December 12 through January 6th.

845
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,740
We have nightly posadas,

846
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:11,710
celebrations that take place
in different family homes.

847
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:14,010
We always have lots of food,

848
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:18,150
games and piñatas that we fill
with fruits and candy.

849
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:20,690
And fireworks,
lots of fireworks.

850
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,020
That sounds amazing.

851
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,360
the Christmas cat
is a huge beast

852
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,430
that comes down the mountainside
at Christmas

853
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,600
and eats all the children

854
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:36,040
that do not get new clothes
for Christmas.

855
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:37,240
Oh.

856
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,570
we also like shortbread cookies.

857
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:49,420
in Italy it's tradition to play
the bagpipes at Christmas.

858
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:50,620
Oh.

859
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:53,520
Fried chicken.

860
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,890
Fried chicken?

861
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:58,390
The most popular Christmas meal
in japan.

862
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:00,890
We love the party buckets.

863
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,940
-hey.
-Anything good?

864
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:12,640
Yeah, I think so.

865
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:15,110
Although, I'm not sure why
a carnivorous cat

866
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,480
with a taste for human flesh

867
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:19,450
gets people in the Christmas
spirit, but, you know.

868
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,980
I mean, the Christmas spirit
works in mysterious ways.

869
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:23,920
That it does.

870
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:26,220
Oh, by the way, do you have
any ideas for Christmas music

871
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,490
for the party?

872
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,620
I mean, I'm down for
a good bagpipe ballad,

873
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:32,260
but I'm not sure that should be
our only source of music.

874
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:35,800
Um, actually, I've heard Mia
play around the inn.

875
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:37,000
She's really good.

876
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:38,600
Maybe we should ask her
to perform?

877
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:40,830
Hm. That sounds like
a great idea.

878
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,770
I'll let you get
right on that.

879
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,000
You want me to ask her?

880
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:47,070
Yeah. Obviously.

881
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:49,780
Ok.

882
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:51,310
All right. Well, I'm gonna
head up.

883
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:53,010
I gotta polish my portfolio,

884
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,910
catalogue my client
testimonials,

885
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:56,520
review my references

886
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:59,320
and reorganize the budget
and design templates.

887
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,750
Wow. And I thought indexing
all the poetry works

888
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:04,920
from the Elizabethan and
Victorian eras was tedious.

889
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,830
All right, I'll see you tomorrow
at the Christmas card-a-thon.

890
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,860
-All right.
-Good night.

891
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:15,370
This is the year that we
accidentally double-booked

892
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,200
Mrs. Thompson and Mr. Clark
in the same room.

893
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:21,370
Ten years of marriage later I'd
say it worked out well for them.

894
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,780
I love being a chapter
in someone else's story.

895
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:26,210
Even a short one.

896
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,380
I'm gonna miss that.

897
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:30,350
We're still gonna be a part of
people's stories.

898
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:33,290
We're just moving
into a new genre.

899
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,190
The adventure genre.

900
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:39,830
What do you say to Christmas
in Paris next year?

901
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:43,560
Crème brûlée on the seine,
lights along the gondolas.

902
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:47,670
Carolers singing noel blanc
in the city square.

903
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:48,700
Sold.

904
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,480
you two have a minute?
Noah's asleep.

905
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:57,810
Sure.

906
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:01,650
So, I've been going over
the numbers you gave me.

907
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:05,920
Um, I gotta say,
I don't understand.

908
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:07,490
Don't understand what?

909
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,160
Well your profits are increasing
and judging from the pattern

910
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:11,060
they're likely to continue
to increase.

911
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:12,930
Usually when we get the word
on a place like this

912
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:15,430
it's because the business
is struggling,

913
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,060
but this place is
a huge success.

914
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:21,700
so, why give it up?

915
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:24,870
Well, it's less about
giving it up.

916
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:27,710
It's more about letting it go.

917
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:30,440
Moving on doesn't have to be
a bad thing.

918
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:32,710
We might be old,
but we're not that old.

919
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:35,180
Still got a lot of years left
in us.

920
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:37,550
Years that we want to spend
sipping on mai tais

921
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:39,420
in the Maldives.

922
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:40,590
Is that so wrong?

923
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:42,860
No, no it's not.

924
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:44,690
We've run this place
for many years.

925
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:46,060
Rick's mother ran it before us

926
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:48,260
and his grandmother
ran it before her.

927
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:51,300
It's just time for someone else
to have a turn.

928
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:52,900
Paige didn't want
to take it over?

929
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:56,800
Well, of course part of us
hoped for that,

930
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:58,440
but she's got her own life
in Denver

931
00:43:58,470 --> 00:43:59,970
separate from all of this.

932
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:02,740
She's happy with her
own career.

933
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:04,080
Is she?

934
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:07,310
What does that mean?

935
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:12,750
Well, I got the impression
that...

936
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:22,900
I just think you need to tell
her the truth, 'cause I can't.

937
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:26,300
I just think that she deserves
to know.

938
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:29,670
-You're right.
-I agree.

939
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:35,510
We'll tell her tomorrow.

00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:41,680

941
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,720

00:44:59,370 --> 00:45:01,600
-Paige?
-Yeah?

947
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:05,500
There's something we wanted
to talk to you about.

948
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:07,210
What's up?

949
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:09,180
It's about the inn.

950
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:09,940
Your mom and I...

951
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:11,410
Wait...

952
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:13,350
I think I know what
you're gonna say.

953
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:18,350
And, as much as
I'd want you to,

954
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:19,720
I know that it's unreasonable

955
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:22,960
to think you guys would run
this place forever.

956
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:25,120
And I know that traveling
is something you've wanted to do

957
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:26,730
for a while now
and it makes me happy

958
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:29,300
to see you guys seizing life
in that way.

959
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:32,360
Carpe Diem and all that jazz.

960
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,200
Anyway, I've been thinking
about it a lot,

961
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,870
about what this place
means to me,

962
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:40,570
what it means to everyone.

963
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:41,940
There's so much potential here

964
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:44,310
and I would hate to see it
go to waste.

965
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:47,650
But, I would also hate to see
you guys continue on

966
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:50,950
with something just because
you felt like you had to.

967
00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:52,450
Ok.

968
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:56,290
And I've felt more fulfilled
planning this party

969
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,560
in coyote creek
over the past week

970
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:00,130
than I have in my company
in Denver

971
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,160
over the past year.

972
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:07,400
So, basically, my answer is,
I will consider it.

973
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,770
I will consider taking over
the inn.

974
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:14,340
That's what you guys wanted
to talk to me about, right?

975
00:46:14,410 --> 00:46:17,440
-Uh...
-Not exactly.

976
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:18,680
Hi, Paige.

977
00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:27,350
Uh, we'll talk about this later,
ok?

978
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:38,200
so, this is the Christmas
card-a-thon?

979
00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:39,800
The one and only.

980
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:43,440
We have a huge list of names and
army bases of overseas soldiers

981
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:45,540
who'd really love a good
Christmas card.

982
00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:47,310
So, am I gonna be able
to wrangle you in

983
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:48,440
for some Christmas
card signing?

984
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:52,110
Duh, I have excellent
penmanship.

985
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:00,820
what's wrong?

986
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:04,320
Nothing. I, I just don't know
what to write.

987
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:08,160
Well, merry Christmas is usually
a good place to start.

988
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:13,370
so, how did all this get
started anyways?

989
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:16,200
Well, both Quinn's parents
are in the military

990
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,500
and they missed
a few Christmases

991
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:19,510
when she was growing up.

992
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:21,240
So this place and my family

993
00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:23,480
became like a second home
to her,

994
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:26,750
but she never missed a year
writing them for Christmas.

995
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:28,880
-Where are they now?
-Belgium.

996
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:31,420
But they'll be here
in the new year.

997
00:47:31,490 --> 00:47:33,890
That's gotta be tough.

998
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,350
Christmas is supposed to be
something you spend

999
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:37,160
with the people you love.

1000
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:40,990
I think it's great, though,

1001
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:45,200
that this one small practice
grew into this huge tradition.

1002
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:49,240
Yeah, yeah a few of the guests
had loved ones overseas

1003
00:47:49,270 --> 00:47:52,670
and kind of snowballed into
the event that it is today.

1004
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:54,510
It's really cool to see
everybody working together

1005
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:56,040
for the common good.

1006
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:59,580
At least that's what someone
with actual emotions would say.

1007
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:04,080
When I said that I didn't
mean it like that.

1008
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:05,580
It's ok.

1009
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:08,620
I haven't exactly been
transparent about everything.

1010
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:10,420
It's hard for me to...

1011
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:13,130
-Open up?
-Yeah.

1012
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:17,130
Why is that?

1013
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,700
See, to explain to you why it
would be hard for me to open up

1014
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:22,970
would actually require me
to open up.

1015
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,640
Catch 22.

1016
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:34,610
Noah's mom left
when he was four.

1017
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:38,420
I guess she just realized
one day

1018
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:40,790
she wasn't ready
to be a mom.

1019
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:43,320
I'm so sorry.

1020
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:46,890
I can't even imagine what that
must have been like for Noah.

1021
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:52,400
-Or for you.
-It's ok.

1022
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:54,900
But that's why I try to make
our life one big adventure.

1023
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:56,570
Especially around
the holidays.

1024
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:57,970
Yeah.

1025
00:48:58,010 --> 00:49:00,410
I figure if we have enough good
memories someplace new,

1026
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,240
then the old ones won't...

1027
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:05,280
-Hurt as much?
-Yeah.

1028
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:16,490
Long time since I've seen him
this happy... Or excited.

1029
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:27,770
Paige, there's something
I want to tell you.

1030
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,370
What's that?

1031
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:33,810
Hey, Paige, look at all these
photos I took.

1032
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:36,840
Wow, that's amazing, Noah.

1033
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:39,810
These look like they should be
in a Christmas catalogue.

1034
00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:43,680
I don't know. My work's
more editorial.

1035
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:45,320
Uh, lean in.

1036
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:47,950
Us?

1037
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:50,060
Who else would I be
talking to?

1038
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:01,570
sorry.

1039
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:19,550
so, we definitely need to start
rearranging in here.

1040
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:21,350
I want to decorate each
of the main rooms

1041
00:50:21,390 --> 00:50:23,390
after a different
country's Christmas.

1042
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:29,660
Uh, Quinn, do you think you're
ok to close up without me?

1043
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:31,660
Oh, sure, stick around
for the fun,

1044
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:33,870
dip out on the clean-up
duty.

1045
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:40,440
yeah, ok. Ok, yeah.
Yeah.

1046
00:50:41,010 --> 00:50:42,610
Good night, Paige.

1047
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:46,110
-Hey.
-Hi.

1048
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:49,950
So, uh, there is something
I wanted to ask you.

1049
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:51,520
Yeah?

1050
00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:54,390
Um... I was wondering,

1051
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:56,860
I was wondering if you would
want to perform

1052
00:50:56,890 --> 00:51:00,090
at the inn's Christmas party.

1053
00:51:00,130 --> 00:51:05,530
Oh, uh, yeah.
Yeah sure, I'd love to.

1054
00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:07,630
-Great.
-Great.

1055
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:14,870
Well, good night.

1056
00:51:14,910 --> 00:51:16,280
'night.

1057
00:51:47,310 --> 00:51:49,510
Hey kiddo, I'm just gonna
step out for a minute, ok,

1058
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:50,780
but I'll be right back.

1059
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:52,080
Ok.

1060
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:01,120
hello, coyote creek inn.

1061
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,420
Hi. Is Mr. And Mrs. Parker
there?

1062
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:04,590
Uh, no, sorry.

1063
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:06,130
They've actually turned in
for the night.

1064
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,690
Um, what about Dylan,
Dylan bailey?

1065
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,860
<i>I'm trying to reach him</i>
<i>but he hasn't returned my calls.</i>

1066
00:52:10,930 --> 00:52:13,600
Oh, may I ask who's calling?

1067
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:15,700
<i> I'm his brother,</i>
<i> jack bailey.</i>

1068
00:52:15,770 --> 00:52:17,470
Oh, hi.

1069
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:19,840
Well, actually I think he also
turned in for the night,

1070
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:21,170
but can I take a message?

1071
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:22,540
Uh, yeah, sure.

1072
00:52:22,610 --> 00:52:23,880
Can you tell him
I'm forwarding

1073
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:26,650
some final estimates on the inn
ahead of the sale?

1074
00:52:28,550 --> 00:52:29,950
<i>Hello?</i>

1075
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,450
Yeah, I'll tell him.

1076
00:52:31,490 --> 00:52:33,120
<i>Thank you.</i>

1077
00:52:51,010 --> 00:52:52,040
Yeah, but...

1078
00:52:52,110 --> 00:52:54,510
To you.

1079
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:55,870
Yeah.

1080
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:57,480
How could you have not
told me?

1081
00:52:57,510 --> 00:52:59,140
How could they not have
told me?

1082
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:01,110
Well, they wanted to tell you,
they did.

1083
00:53:01,150 --> 00:53:03,380
The right moment
just never came up and,

1084
00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:04,950
and I didn't think it was
my place to...

1085
00:53:04,990 --> 00:53:07,690
You didn't think it was
your place to tell me the truth?

1086
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,660
No, you were just hoping
that they would do it for you

1087
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:12,690
and then your part
would be overlooked.

1088
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:14,290
When your parents
first contacted my firm

1089
00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:18,630
it was just another property,
another sale, another client.

1090
00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:21,500
How was I supposed to know
that I would get here and...

1091
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:28,240
I just didn't think that
I would get to know you

1092
00:53:28,310 --> 00:53:33,510
the way that I have and the more
time we spent together,

1093
00:53:33,550 --> 00:53:35,180
the harder it was to tell you.

1094
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:36,680
Ok, but how can you
not see

1095
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:40,250
that now all that time we spent
together feels like a lie?

1096
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:46,090
Look, I never meant
to hurt you, Paige.

1097
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,690
I'm sorry.

1098
00:54:11,590 --> 00:54:12,680
morning.

1099
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:16,520
Paige?

1100
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:21,030
Hey, sorry.
Good morning.

1101
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:24,860
Oh, how'd it go with Mia?

1102
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:28,570
Uh, she said she'd play
at the party.

1103
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:30,970
That's it?

1104
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:35,310
yeah, that's it.

1105
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:37,080
I chickened out.

1106
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:41,150
I'm just mad at myself,
that's all.

1107
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:43,920
I'm sorry it didn't go the way
you wanted it to.

1108
00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:45,880
But you'll get another chance.

1109
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:48,750
-You think?
-Yeah, I do.

1110
00:54:48,790 --> 00:54:51,620
Just don't fumble it
a second time.

1111
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:52,960
I won't.

1112
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,130
What's wrong?

1113
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:03,300
My parents are selling
the inn.

1114
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:06,670
-Wait, what?
-To Dylan.

1115
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:10,480
-Wait, what?!
-Yeah.

1116
00:55:10,510 --> 00:55:12,980
You didn't know anything
about this, right?

1117
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:14,850
I honestly didn't.

1118
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:19,120
But business has been
so good.

1119
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:21,650
They haven't said anything
to me.

1120
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:24,160
They didn't say anything
to anyone.

1121
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:29,630
I'm sorry, Paige.

1122
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:33,270
I don't even know
what to say.

1123
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:34,870
Me neither.

1124
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:38,700
Thanks for the walk,
I needed that.

1125
00:55:38,770 --> 00:55:40,940
-That was nice.
-Yeah.

1126
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,480
I'll give you guys some space.

1127
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:56,020
So, I got a call last night
from Dylan's brother.

1128
00:55:57,890 --> 00:56:00,460
Yeah, I know about the sale.

1129
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:03,460
Paige...

1130
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:05,730
Why didn't you guys
just tell me?

1131
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:08,500
We tried to.

1132
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:11,070
Not hard enough.

1133
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:13,170
Yesterday at the card-a-thon
when you brought up

1134
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:14,810
taking over this place.

1135
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:16,980
You've never said anything
about that before.

1136
00:56:17,010 --> 00:56:19,580
We had no idea it was something
you were considering.

1137
00:56:19,650 --> 00:56:22,380
We thought you were happy
in Denver.

1138
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:24,150
I mean, we didn't know.

1139
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:26,550
You still should have told me.

1140
00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:28,420
And to think you guys let me
go on and on,

1141
00:56:28,490 --> 00:56:29,690
planning this Christmas party

1142
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:33,190
as if it's just another
Christmas, but it's not.

1143
00:56:33,230 --> 00:56:35,360
It's the last Christmas here.

1144
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,100
That's why we waited
to tell you.

1145
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:38,530
We didn't want to ruin it
for you.

1146
00:56:38,570 --> 00:56:40,930
But I'm an adult and I can
handle the truth.

1147
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,740
I need you guys to trust me
with the truth.

1148
00:56:43,770 --> 00:56:46,440
We just wanted
to protect you.

1149
00:56:46,510 --> 00:56:48,110
We're so sorry.

1150
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:53,510
It's time to see what someone
else can do with this place.

1151
00:56:53,550 --> 00:56:57,620
Yeah, but that someone
could have been me.

1152
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:06,190
Would you be taking over the inn
because you really wanted to

1153
00:57:06,230 --> 00:57:09,690
or because it's what you thought
you should do?

1154
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:11,700
I don't know.

1155
00:57:11,730 --> 00:57:14,370
But now I won't even get
a chance to find out.

1156
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:20,770
I'm gonna go into town.

1157
00:57:20,810 --> 00:57:23,740
I can't even think about this
right now

1158
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:25,040
and the party is
in three days

1159
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:26,810
and I still have to transform
this place

1160
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:29,750
into a culturally inspired
Christmas haven.

1161
00:57:32,650 --> 00:57:33,920
Paige.

1162
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:38,890
Try to take it easy on Dylan,
if you can.

1163
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:42,490
Why should I?

1164
00:58:01,350 --> 00:58:03,150
-you've got a lot-
-no, no, it's ok.

1165
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:05,620
-Paige, come on.
-I said I got it.

1166
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:13,190
Where's Noah?

1167
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:17,760
Back at the inn, brainstorming
new eggnog flavors with rick.

1168
00:58:19,770 --> 00:58:22,330
Look, I wanted to find you
and tell you how sorry I am.

1169
00:58:22,370 --> 00:58:23,800
I don't want your apology

1170
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:26,300
and I don't need some speech
or some explanation

1171
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:28,640
that just makes you feel better
about what you've done.

1172
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:32,840
Ok, ok.
There's more.

1173
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,550
Ok, what?

1174
00:58:38,350 --> 00:58:43,290
My firm, my brother and I,

1175
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:45,360
there's gonna be a redesign
of the inn.

1176
00:58:45,390 --> 00:58:46,560
And I'm telling you
all this now

1177
00:58:46,630 --> 00:58:48,060
because I wanted to be
upfront, okay?

1178
00:58:48,130 --> 00:58:49,560
We have an investor
that's interested in us

1179
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:51,660
but they're mainly focused
on larger commercial projects

1180
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:54,130
and jack and I, we owe them
new blueprints.

1181
00:58:55,970 --> 00:58:57,340
Do my parents know?

1182
00:58:57,370 --> 00:59:01,170
Yeah, I told them right before
I went looking for you.

1183
00:59:07,350 --> 00:59:08,480
So that's it?

1184
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:12,050
Yeah, we have nothing else
to talk about.

1185
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:16,090
I'm glad it's been a successful
business trip.

1186
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:32,940
hey.

1187
00:59:33,010 --> 00:59:34,410
What is all this?

1188
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:36,210
I told Julie about the sale.

1189
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,410
-And I told George.
-And I told Sara.

1190
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:40,880
-And Sara must have told...
-Everyone.

1191
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:48,050
Ok, take a look at this.

1192
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:51,020
Christmas is just days away.

1193
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:52,420
And you'd think people
would have their own

1194
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:55,290
massively overcrowded
family gatherings to attend to.

1195
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:58,530
Yeah, but I guess this is
a family too, right?

1196
00:59:58,570 --> 01:00:00,300
The coyote creek family.

1197
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:09,270
Ok, everyone huddle in.

1198
01:00:09,310 --> 01:00:10,440
Right this way.

1199
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:11,810
ok.

1200
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:14,580
What do you think
you're doing?

1201
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:15,980
Helping.

1202
01:00:16,050 --> 01:00:17,550
No, not a chance. I think
you've done quite enough.

1203
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:18,880
Not even going to give me
a chance

1204
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:20,250
to try to make it up
to you?

1205
01:00:20,290 --> 01:00:21,420
Are we really gonna do
this here?

1206
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:22,820
I don't think we're
in a position

1207
01:00:22,890 --> 01:00:24,990
to be turning away
extra help.

1208
01:00:28,730 --> 01:00:30,630
Ok, fine.

1209
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:33,630
All right. First rule here,
keep the client happy.

1210
01:00:33,670 --> 01:00:35,270
We need to do something

1211
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:36,800
to keep people's minds off
this check-in circus.

1212
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:38,600
Provide some type
of distraction.

1213
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:40,810
Uh, second rule,
think outside the box.

1214
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:43,110
We have a lot of people here
and not a lot of space,

1215
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:45,580
so we need to find some other
type of accommodations.

1216
01:00:45,610 --> 01:00:47,250
How are we gonna do that?

1217
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:48,410
No idea.

1218
01:00:48,450 --> 01:00:51,080
Well, aren't you sitting
on like 30 acres?

1219
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:52,650
Yeah.

1220
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:55,290
I'm not sure people will take
to the idea of sleeping outside.

1221
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:57,120
This isn't man vs. Wild.

1222
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:58,920
Who said anything about outside?

1223
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:01,190
It just, leave the
accommodations to me.

1224
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:03,530
You really expect us
to trust you?

1225
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:06,300
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

1226
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:10,670
Ok, well it seems we have
no choice,

1227
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:13,770
so Dylan will do whatever
he's gonna do

1228
01:01:13,810 --> 01:01:16,010
and the rest of us should focus
on keeping people happy.

1229
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,280
In the meantime,

1230
01:01:17,310 --> 01:01:19,310
dad, you wanted taste testers
for you eggnog?

1231
01:01:19,350 --> 01:01:21,350
Well, you got 'em.

1232
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:24,380
Quinn, see if Mia can do
an early soundcheck.

1233
01:01:24,450 --> 01:01:25,780
Ok. Everyone good?

1234
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:26,720
Mmmhmm.

1235
01:01:26,790 --> 01:01:28,350
Ok. Break.

1236
01:01:44,910 --> 01:01:47,340
Thanks for doing this
on such short notice.

1237
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:53,550
If anyone can lull an angry mob
into a spellbound silence

1238
01:01:53,580 --> 01:01:56,150
it's probably you.

1239
01:01:56,180 --> 01:02:02,750
Like pan's pipe or lyre
of Hermes or the sirens?

1240
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:07,090
Didn't the last one end
in shipwreck and disaster?

1241
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:08,330
Yep.

1242
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:11,560
Speaking of disaster,
about last night.

1243
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:13,400
What about it?

1244
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:16,030
So, listen, um...

1245
01:02:16,070 --> 01:02:17,770
I might just be
reading things wrong

1246
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:21,540
and if I am we can just pretend
that this never happened.

1247
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:23,240
What the heck, it's Christmas,
I'm just gonna say it.

1248
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:24,540
I like you.

1249
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:30,580
I've always liked you.

1250
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:33,720
Finally.

1251
01:02:49,540 --> 01:02:50,870
great.

1252
01:02:52,270 --> 01:02:53,470
It'll be here in an hour.

1253
01:02:53,540 --> 01:02:54,870
What will be?

1254
01:02:55,810 --> 01:02:58,140
I don't like not being a part
of the plan.

1255
01:02:58,210 --> 01:02:59,810
I know.

1256
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:01,910
What are we going to do
for a full hour?

1257
01:03:01,950 --> 01:03:05,450
Um, well, I think there's a cool
place to take some more photos

1258
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:06,620
just around the bend.

1259
01:03:06,650 --> 01:03:08,420

Paige, I'm really sorry.

1272
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:42,920
It wasn't fair of me
to hide that from you.

1273
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:45,360
I was just trying to do
right by your parents

1274
01:03:45,430 --> 01:03:46,790
and I was trying
to remind myself

1275
01:03:46,830 --> 01:03:50,160
that it was just business,
but it's not.

1276
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:51,700
This place is so much more
than that,

1277
01:03:51,770 --> 01:03:53,870
and I see that now.

1278
01:03:53,930 --> 01:03:55,630
You helped me see that.

1279
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:01,710
Just makes you think,

1280
01:04:01,780 --> 01:04:03,270
you know, if it wasn't
like this.

1281
01:04:03,310 --> 01:04:05,640
Like what?

1282
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:10,950
If I was just a normal guest
and you were just you,

1283
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:12,820
none of this got
in the way.

1284
01:04:17,990 --> 01:04:19,390
No way!

1285
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:22,960
I found Charlotte the marmot!

1286
01:04:24,730 --> 01:04:27,700
But I don't have anything
to put on her.

1287
01:04:27,730 --> 01:04:33,040
Oh, um, here.
You can use my scarf.

1288
01:04:33,070 --> 01:04:34,670
Come here Charlotte.

1289
01:04:36,710 --> 01:04:40,080
There, now you're officially
a part of our tradition.

1290
01:04:40,150 --> 01:04:42,510
This is the best
Christmas ever!

1291
01:04:53,260 --> 01:04:55,890
Here we are.
Right on time.

1292
01:05:04,670 --> 01:05:06,740
What is this?

1293
01:05:06,770 --> 01:05:08,010
Glamping.

1294
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:10,710
It's like camping,
but with a little more...

1295
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:12,010
Pizzazz?

1296
01:05:12,050 --> 01:05:13,410
What does that mean?

1297
01:05:13,450 --> 01:05:15,410
Something with style
and glamour.

1298
01:05:15,450 --> 01:05:16,750
A little extra oomph.

1299
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:19,620
Then yeah. Dad called
in the pizzazz.

1300
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:25,060
I'm a loyal customer of
a lot of rental companies.

1301
01:05:25,090 --> 01:05:27,390
Perks of the rambling
man lifestyle.

1302
01:05:27,430 --> 01:05:30,300
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

1303
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:31,960
I owed you one.

1304
01:05:43,810 --> 01:05:46,140
so what's with
all the cobwebs?

1305
01:05:46,210 --> 01:05:48,610
It's Ukrainian folklore.

1306
01:05:48,650 --> 01:05:50,780
There was once an old widow
who lived with her children

1307
01:05:50,820 --> 01:05:52,320
in this tiny shack.

1308
01:05:52,390 --> 01:05:55,220
And they had no gifts
or decorations

1309
01:05:55,260 --> 01:05:56,750
and on Christmas morning
they woke up

1310
01:05:56,790 --> 01:05:59,890
to find their Christmas tree
completely covered in cobwebs,

1311
01:05:59,930 --> 01:06:01,930
but when sunlight entered
the shack,

1312
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:04,160
all the cobwebs turned
to gold.

1313
01:06:04,230 --> 01:06:05,960
Oh.

1314
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,170
I love stories about the
importance of material wealth.

1315
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:12,570
Well, I like it because it shows
that anything is possible

1316
01:06:12,610 --> 01:06:14,340
during the Christmas season.

1317
01:06:14,410 --> 01:06:17,080
No matter who you are
of where you come from.

1318
01:06:17,110 --> 01:06:19,910
There's always a little hope
for some Christmas magic.

1319
01:06:19,950 --> 01:06:22,280
You never know what could be
waiting for you in the morning.

1320
01:06:27,350 --> 01:06:29,350
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

1321
01:06:32,330 --> 01:06:33,520
Hey!

1322
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:39,130
Julie, are you ok?

1323
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:46,370
Well... It's just... I've worked
here nearly half my life.

1324
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:50,170
I've spent most birthdays,
most Christmases,

1325
01:06:50,210 --> 01:06:54,310
even most world cups
with you all.

1326
01:06:54,350 --> 01:06:57,480
What am I supposed
to do next?

1327
01:06:57,520 --> 01:07:00,890
And Paige, I think this is
going to be

1328
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:03,120
the best Christmas party yet.

1329
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:06,990
I love seeing all these
different traditions
come to life,

1330
01:07:07,030 --> 01:07:10,400
but, well, you've been
so focused

1331
01:07:10,460 --> 01:07:12,500
on including the rest
of the world

1332
01:07:12,530 --> 01:07:14,800
you've overlooked our corner
of it.

1333
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:19,400
Where's coyote creek
in all of this?

1334
01:07:52,510 --> 01:07:54,370
you ok?

1335
01:07:54,410 --> 01:07:56,740
Yeah, I'm fine.

1336
01:07:56,780 --> 01:08:00,580
Except for the colossal
oversight on my part.

1337
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:03,580
I can't believe for
the very last Christmas
at coyote creek inn

1338
01:08:03,620 --> 01:08:06,020
I overlooked coyote creek.

1339
01:08:06,050 --> 01:08:08,590
I mean, how could I be so...

1340
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:10,290
Hey, hey, hey,
don't do that.

1341
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:11,920
Do what?

1342
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:13,720
Undermine yourself.

1343
01:08:21,070 --> 01:08:22,930
I don't want to leave tomorrow.

1344
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,300
Then don't.

1345
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:31,310
It's not that simple.

1346
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:01,840
all right.

1347
01:09:06,250 --> 01:09:07,280
Oooh!

1348
01:09:07,350 --> 01:09:09,180
Hey, so, Sara will be
dropping by

1349
01:09:09,220 --> 01:09:11,420
with the first batch of desserts
later today

1350
01:09:11,450 --> 01:09:13,680
and I am on fire
with these recipes.

1351
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:15,690
Ok. Well, please be careful or
that will literally be the case.

1352
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:17,260
oh!

1353
01:09:17,290 --> 01:09:18,390
Thanks.

1354
01:09:21,230 --> 01:09:22,560
What's up?

1355
01:09:23,260 --> 01:09:24,460
Well, Julie's right.

1356
01:09:24,530 --> 01:09:27,470
Party's tomorrow,
what am I gonna do?

1357
01:09:27,530 --> 01:09:30,640
Well, you'll think of something.
You always do.

1358
01:09:50,490 --> 01:09:52,890
Good morning, Paige.

1359
01:09:52,930 --> 01:09:55,090
We've got a little something
for you.

1360
01:09:56,330 --> 01:09:58,830
People usually save the gifts
for Christmas day.

1361
01:09:58,900 --> 01:10:01,470
Well, we thought you needed
a little inspiration.

1362
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:04,400
We've been putting this together
over the last year.

1363
01:10:07,070 --> 01:10:08,970
Oh, wow.

1364
01:10:23,660 --> 01:10:26,590
I'm really gonna miss
this place.

1365
01:10:26,630 --> 01:10:29,990
It's ok to miss it, but keep
in mind that the memories

1366
01:10:30,030 --> 01:10:34,300
that people have made here,
those will never go away.

1367
01:10:36,170 --> 01:10:37,470
That's it.

1368
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:39,300
What?

1369
01:10:39,340 --> 01:10:42,440
Let's have the guests write down
their favorite Christmas memory

1370
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:44,210
at coyote creek inn.

1371
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:49,310
It could be a story or a single
sentence or an old photograph.

1372
01:10:49,350 --> 01:10:51,480
Anything that shows the part
this inn played

1373
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:53,320
in people's lives.

1374
01:10:53,350 --> 01:10:58,290
And it'll be like one last trip
down memory lane.

1375
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:00,790
Well, then I'm gonna write
out Christmas of '99

1376
01:11:00,830 --> 01:11:01,960
when your mom...

1377
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,790
When are you gonna stop
bringing that up?

1378
01:11:03,830 --> 01:11:05,530
When it stops bothering you.

1379
01:11:07,070 --> 01:11:08,530
I think it's a great idea.

1380
01:11:08,570 --> 01:11:11,670
I'd love to look back on a few
of the good times.

1381
01:11:35,190 --> 01:11:37,530
-hey, Noah.
-Hey.

1382
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:39,000
What memory are you
gonna pick?

1383
01:11:39,030 --> 01:11:40,830
I don't know
which to choose?

1384
01:11:40,870 --> 01:11:44,440
Decorating the Christmas tree,
baking cookies with Sara,

1385
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:46,170
the Christmas card-a-thon,

1386
01:11:46,210 --> 01:11:50,510
hank's pavilion or the
gingerbread eggnog batch.

1387
01:11:50,540 --> 01:11:51,940
Gingerbread, huh?

1388
01:11:52,010 --> 01:11:54,010
I thought vanilla bean
was the best.

1389
01:11:54,050 --> 01:11:55,610
Agree to disagree.

1390
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:59,950
so, where's your dad?

1391
01:12:00,020 --> 01:12:01,790
He's on the phone
with uncle jack.

1392
01:12:01,850 --> 01:12:03,720
He'll be down in a minute.

1393
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:06,790
So, you're taking off then,
huh?

1394
01:12:06,860 --> 01:12:08,030
Yeah.

1395
01:12:08,060 --> 01:12:10,700
Christmas at the grand
canyon awaits.

1396
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:18,400
<i>I sent the appraisal</i>
<i> report to Meyer's national</i>

1397
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:20,710
<i> and they're looking over</i>
<i> the preliminary redesign.</i>

1398
01:12:20,740 --> 01:12:22,370
<i> The Parkers have signed</i>
<i> on the dotted line,</i>

1399
01:12:22,410 --> 01:12:24,780
<i> I've signed, but this is</i>
<i> the bailey brothers firm</i>

1400
01:12:24,810 --> 01:12:26,710
and both bailey brothers
need to sign.

1401
01:12:26,750 --> 01:12:28,050
What are you waiting for?

1402
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:29,650
I just... I thought maybe
there was some way

1403
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:30,980
we could compromise.

1404
01:12:31,050 --> 01:12:33,480
Maybe we could involve
the Parkers in the redesign

1405
01:12:33,550 --> 01:12:35,250
or, or bring 'em on
as some sort of...

1406
01:12:35,290 --> 01:12:37,590
<i>What? No, I'm... I'm sorry</i>
<i> but no.</i>

1407
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:40,420
This is business. It's nothing
personal against the Parkers.

1408
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:42,260
When we found the firm,
we had a mission, right?

1409
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:46,560
To find, preserve and cultivate
unique properties.

1410
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:48,470
Don't quote the mission at me,
I know it.

1411
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:50,570
I'm just saying, I don't think
anybody's gonna rush to,

1412
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:52,100
to check into a new hotel

1413
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:54,070
just 'cause it's got
a jacuzzi and wi-fi.

1414
01:12:54,110 --> 01:12:55,510
I certainly would.

1415
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:56,740
Jack.

1416
01:12:58,180 --> 01:12:59,280
Please.

1417
01:13:09,420 --> 01:13:10,920
I spoke with jack.

1418
01:13:12,490 --> 01:13:14,630
I told him I wouldn't sign
until I'm completely satisfied

1419
01:13:14,660 --> 01:13:16,030
with the redesign.

1420
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:18,700
Oh, well that's good,
I guess.

1421
01:13:18,770 --> 01:13:21,700
I'll try and keep you involved,
as long as I can.

1422
01:13:21,770 --> 01:13:24,340
If you have any ideas
or suggestions,

1423
01:13:24,370 --> 01:13:26,140
I want you to reach out
to me, ok?

1424
01:13:26,170 --> 01:13:28,110
A business card? Really?

1425
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:31,780
-I'm, I'm not used to this.
-Used to what?

1426
01:13:31,810 --> 01:13:33,380
Feeling like this.

1427
01:13:35,350 --> 01:13:36,550
I mean, the past few years,

1428
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:38,320
it's just been Noah and I
versus the world.

1429
01:13:38,350 --> 01:13:40,450
He's the only constant
in my life.

1430
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:46,360
The thought of bringing somebody
new into that is terrifying.

1431
01:13:50,830 --> 01:13:54,500
I have to think of Noah,
I gotta protect him.

1432
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:58,670
Maybe in a year or two, or...

1433
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:01,340
You don't have to do that,
you know?

1434
01:14:01,370 --> 01:14:03,310
Do what?

1435
01:14:03,340 --> 01:14:05,480
I get what you're saying,
I do.

1436
01:14:05,510 --> 01:14:09,750
It's just, I've finally realized
what I want.

1437
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:12,720
And I want a partner
that I can build a life with

1438
01:14:12,750 --> 01:14:15,150
and I want someone
who wants that too.

1439
01:14:15,190 --> 01:14:19,160
I can't just wait around
until you're ready.

1440
01:14:21,330 --> 01:14:24,090
Um, is it ok if I say bye?

1441
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:25,730
Yeah, of course, bud.

1442
01:14:26,670 --> 01:14:28,200
Come here.

1443
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:33,400
Thanks, Paige. I've had
a great time here.

1444
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:37,610
No, not great...
Stupendous.

1445
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:39,080
Me too.

1446
01:14:39,110 --> 01:14:41,280
I hope you have fun
in the grand canyon.

1447
01:14:41,350 --> 01:14:44,420
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

1448
01:14:44,450 --> 01:14:46,280
Merry Christmas, Paige.

1449
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:51,120
-Come on, bud.
-Ok.

1450
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:32,630
hey, what's up?

1451
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:34,770
Nothing.

1452
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:37,430
It's not nothing.
Come on, tell me.

1453
01:15:37,470 --> 01:15:42,910
It's just, you are a complete
and utter buffoon.

1454
01:15:44,310 --> 01:15:46,040
word of the day?

1455
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:49,580
Yeah, but I mean it.

1456
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:53,250
Hm. I did kind of mess up,
didn't I?

1457
01:15:53,290 --> 01:15:57,420
It's not too late.
We can turn around.

1458
01:15:57,460 --> 01:15:59,990
Yeah, but don't you want
to see the grand canyon?

1459
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:03,160
It's just a big hole
in the ground, right?

1460
01:16:03,230 --> 01:16:06,000
Yeah, but you could have
told me that sooner.

1461
01:16:06,070 --> 01:16:07,460
I thought you wanted to go.

1462
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:11,140
You wanted to go,
that's why we drove 350 miles.

1463
01:16:11,170 --> 01:16:12,740
If we turn around right now,

1464
01:16:12,770 --> 01:16:15,740
we can still make it in time
for the party.

1465
01:16:33,860 --> 01:16:37,460
Ah, decorating in
complete silence.

1466
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:40,360
Happiest time of year.

1467
01:16:40,430 --> 01:16:42,370
I'm sorry.

1468
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:44,870
Just have a lot
on my mind.

1469
01:16:44,940 --> 01:16:47,640
Is this the kind of thing
where I should ask about it,

1470
01:16:47,670 --> 01:16:49,670
so you can unburden
your thoughts,

1471
01:16:49,710 --> 01:16:51,840
or the kind of thing where
I should just shut my mouth

1472
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:54,140
and stick to
the snow globes?

1473
01:16:54,180 --> 01:16:55,680
The snow globes.

1474
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:57,150
Got it.

1475
01:16:58,550 --> 01:17:02,150
What about work?
Is that off limits?

1476
01:17:02,190 --> 01:17:05,290
How are you feeling about
the promotion?

1477
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:08,960
Honestly, I don't know how
I feel about that anymore.

1478
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,730
I'm gonna submit
my portfolio materials

1479
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:12,330
the first of the new year

1480
01:17:12,370 --> 01:17:15,070
and I know that senior planner
is the next step.

1481
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:17,500
But?

1482
01:17:17,540 --> 01:17:20,240
But, when does it end?

1483
01:17:20,310 --> 01:17:23,870
Senior planner, event manager,
event director.

1484
01:17:23,910 --> 01:17:26,240
There's always another rung
on the corporate ladder

1485
01:17:26,310 --> 01:17:30,680
and to be honest, not really
sure I want to climb it anymore.

1510
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:00,660
What is it?

1511
01:20:00,700 --> 01:20:04,330
The redesign.
Expansion, really.

1512
01:20:04,370 --> 01:20:06,470
Coyote creek inn, 2.0.

1513
01:20:06,510 --> 01:20:09,040
Owned by the bailey brother's
development firm,

1514
01:20:09,070 --> 01:20:13,680
operated by Paige Parker,
if she accepts.

1515
01:20:13,710 --> 01:20:18,750
Oh, and approved by
your parents, if that helps.

1516
01:20:18,820 --> 01:20:22,150
What happened to
the luxury resort?

1517
01:20:22,190 --> 01:20:25,760
I told jack and Meyer's national
that destroying this property

1518
01:20:25,830 --> 01:20:30,190
would wipe out decades
of historical charm

1519
01:20:30,230 --> 01:20:34,700
and eradicate an entire town's
social and civil bonds.

1520
01:20:34,730 --> 01:20:37,670
And then when that didn't work
I just showed him the numbers.

1521
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:42,210
I may not be very convincing,
but dollar signs usually are.

1522
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:45,110
I think the old saying is, don't
fix what isn't broken, right?

1523
01:20:45,180 --> 01:20:48,350
Business men are usually
pretty practical that way.

1524
01:20:48,380 --> 01:20:50,180
Thank you.

1525
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:52,620
It means so much to all of us.

1526
01:20:52,690 --> 01:20:55,220
But, how do I know that
I can trust you?

1527
01:20:55,250 --> 01:20:56,550
I mean, how do I know

1528
01:20:56,590 --> 01:20:59,190
that you're not just gonna
leave again?

1529
01:20:59,230 --> 01:21:02,560
Because letting you down
felt awful.

1530
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:05,030
I never want to do that again.

1531
01:21:06,470 --> 01:21:08,770
I was just trying to do
the right thing yesterday.

1532
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:12,940
I was trying to be
a responsible,

1533
01:21:12,970 --> 01:21:14,910
realistic, level-headed adult,

1534
01:21:14,940 --> 01:21:18,910
which by the way is really
difficult to do

1535
01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:20,910
any time I look at you.

1536
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:28,650
It's never really about Noah,
protecting him, it's about me.

1537
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:30,790
Oh, yeah, no.
I, I know.

1538
01:21:33,990 --> 01:21:36,260
so, I'm gonna stay,

1539
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:39,230
'cause a week with you
wasn't enough time

1540
01:21:39,270 --> 01:21:40,630
and I want to know everything
about you

1541
01:21:40,670 --> 01:21:43,100
and I want to know
how you like your eggs

1542
01:21:43,140 --> 01:21:44,970
and the name of your first dog
and where you were

1543
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,900
when you heard the Beatles
for the first time.

1544
01:21:47,940 --> 01:21:49,970
I'm gonna stick around.

1545
01:21:50,010 --> 01:21:53,680
And not just for the weekend,
or for Christmas,

1546
01:21:53,750 --> 01:21:59,450
but for, at least until
you get tired of me.

1547
01:21:59,490 --> 01:22:02,520
Which you won't,
because as we've established,

1548
01:22:02,590 --> 01:22:03,950
I am incredibly charming.

1549
01:22:03,990 --> 01:22:04,960
Hmm.

1550
01:22:04,990 --> 01:22:06,590
Some might even
say irresistible.

1551
01:22:06,630 --> 01:22:09,190
Oh, would they?

1552
01:22:09,260 --> 01:22:13,660
Well, I'd be lying if I said
I wasn't happy to see you,

1553
01:22:13,700 --> 01:22:18,000
because the truth is,
with you and Noah,

1554
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:20,770
this was starting to feel like
the best Christmas yet.

1555
01:22:40,990 --> 01:22:43,490
