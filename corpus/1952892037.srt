1
00:00:04,637 --> 00:00:07,504
If you're watching this right now...

2
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,738
...it's because you've forgotten

3
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:14,371
why you've locked yourself
in your apartment.

4
00:00:15,081 --> 00:00:18,107
You've given yourself 30 days

5
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:21,949
to figure out
why you're so messed up.

6
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:27,983
Your phone's been turned off.

7
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,463
You don't have shit.

8
00:00:31,564 --> 00:00:34,499
You don't have friends.
You don't have a job.

9
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,730
This is your last chance.

10
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:43,173
'Cause I swear to God,

11
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:48,578
if things don't change
in these next 30 days...

12
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:54,583
...I will kill myself.

13
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:21,878
* I don't need a laser beam *

14
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:29,285
* I don't need the time *

15
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:37,992
* Leave me in the car tonight *

16
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:42,962
* Rest your drunken mind *

17
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:52,137
* I need your grace *

18
00:01:54,981 --> 00:02:02,080
* Alone *

19
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:47,082
Madison.

20
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:52,691
Madison, wake up.
)

21
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:01,236
Madison, can you hear me?

22
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:05,139
I'm Dr. Barnes.

23
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:11,275
Can I have some water?

24
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:16,444
Can you tell me your full name?

25
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,950
Madison Walker.

26
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:25,322
Do you know what month it is?

27
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:31,995
June?

28
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:39,334
July?

29
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:45,314
Have you ever been treated
for any type for of mental illness?

30
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:47,713
I take medication.

31
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,516
And what do you
take medication for?

32
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:54,887
I don't know.

33
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:56,962
You don't know
what you take medication for,

34
00:04:57,063 --> 00:05:00,362
or you were never told
what the medication was for?

35
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:05,233
I don't understand the question.

36
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:11,833
When can I go home?

37
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:15,706
Are you having
any suicidal thoughts now?

38
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,138
No.

39
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,242
Can you tell me
what happened last night?

40
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:26,922
I don't remember.

41
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:29,352
Well, if you don't remember,

42
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:31,794
then how do you know
that you didn't try to take your life?

43
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:35,834
Because I know I wouldn't do that.

44
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,868
Have you ever spent any time
in a psychiatric hospital?

45
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,004
No.

46
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:52,573
Would you ever consider
checking yourself in to one?

47
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:54,652
No.

48
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:04,888
I have that book.

49
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:07,923
Excuse me?

50
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:11,469
I'm gonna give you my number,

51
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:13,971
and, uh, I want you to call me
if you need anything.

52
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:16,507
My mom burned them all.

53
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:18,974
Burned what?

54
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,839
My notebooks.

55
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:24,075
But I hid one so she couldn't find it.

56
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,650
Why did you hide that one
and not the others?

57
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:30,315
Because I needed you to find it.

58
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:04,868
Uh, I was sitting up front
in his station wagon,

59
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:09,414
and he had these, um,
red plastic seat covers.

60
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:11,642
It made a noise when he moved.

61
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:15,585
And there was, like, um, a plastic...

62
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:18,020
Jesus figurine on the dashboard.

63
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:22,891
Why were you alone
in the car with him?

64
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:27,897
Uh, well, it was like, um --
like a field trip to the -- to the zoo,

65
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,901
and, uh -- and the bus
was all filled up,

66
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:33,972
so, um, I rode with him in the car.

67
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:38,607
What happened... in the car?

68
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,745
It's okay. You can tell me.

69
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:47,546
It's okay.

70
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,553
Um...

71
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:52,419
He kissed me.

72
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:56,961
Did he try to...

73
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:58,928
touch you, or...

74
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:06,261
Why didn't you tell your parents
what happened?

75
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:07,964
Um...

76
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:10,065
I told my mom.

77
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:12,667
And what did she say?

78
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:17,210
Um... She didn't believe me.

79
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:21,319
How could she not believe you?

80
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:26,356
She said that, uh, a man of God
would never do something like that.

81
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:30,423
What do you mean, "a man of God"?

82
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,921
Um, he was our priest.

83
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:10,629
Okay, so, I guess
you just fell on that razor.

84
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:11,963
Uh-huh.

85
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:14,266
You know what your problem is?

86
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:17,672
You're too fucking white.

87
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:20,541
You see, Black people --
we don't let shit get to us.

88
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:21,635
I mean, seriously,

89
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:24,510
that's why you don't see Black girls
up in the loony bin.

90
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:26,551
Because we don't let shit bother us.

91
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:28,552
We don't give a fuck.

92
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:32,246
What are you waving at
with that tired-ass...

93
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:35,555
-I'm not interested.
-I'm not selling.

94
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:37,526
Glad we got that straight.

95
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:43,991
You know, tell me something,
beautiful.

96
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:48,800
I bet you like to get fucked
really hard, hmm?

97
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,480
Tell Daddy what you like.

98
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:05,053
Uh, since when do you smoke?

99
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:08,058
What -- what the hell
is your problem?

100
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:11,487
Hello?

101
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:14,824
Mm.

102
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:17,899
Where were we?

103
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:22,741
Put your hands around my throat.

104
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:23,570
What?

105
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:25,200
Oh.

106
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:26,676
Harder.

107
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,437
Yeah. Yeah, you like that?

108
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:30,378
Choke me.

109
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:33,145
Choke me. Choke me.

110
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,085
Please stop.

111
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:38,349
You like getting fucked.

112
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:40,982
Please stop. Please.

113
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,403
I know what you want me to say.

114
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:03,904
What do you think
I want you to say?

115
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:08,144
That they took advantage of me
because I was only 1 3.

116
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:11,280
Well, do you think
they took advantage of you?

117
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,290
No.

118
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:18,719
They got you drunk with the intention
of having sex with you.

119
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:21,265
Look, they've been married
for, like, 1 00 years.

120
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:24,131
They needed something
to spice it up.

121
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:28,800
Did you have any feelings for...
either one of them?

122
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,840
I liked him better.

123
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:37,642
And where is he now?

124
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,781
He killed himself.

125
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:06,804
What do you want?

126
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:08,844
Your rent.
You're like a week late.

127
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,914
It's due on the 1st.

128
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,142
Today is the 9th, sweetheart.

129
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:16,315
I'll have it tomorrow.

130
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,986
No, you --

131
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:24,085
Tomorrow's too late, sweetheart.
Open the door.

132
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:27,731
Tomorrow's too late.

133
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,631
But, now, if you wanted
to do some trading

134
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:32,499
Iike we did back in March...

135
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,699
I'll work with you.

136
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:39,736
I don't know what you're talking about.

137
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:48,350
You have my money by tomorrow
morning or you're out of here.

138
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:15,370
Margaret,
we can't keep doing this.

139
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:18,082
I can.

140
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,774
Why do you want to?

141
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:21,944
'Cause.

142
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:24,488
'Cause why?

143
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:28,192
Because I'd rather slit my wrist

144
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:31,730
or be fucking hung upside down
and beaten to a pulp

145
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,661
than have to talk to you.

146
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:38,793
You're angry.

147
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:42,669
No.

148
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,505
Don't start that psychological shit.

149
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,005
You really don't like me, do you?

150
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,779
Beth, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

151
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:58,479
It's not that --
that I don't like you.

152
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:01,349
I fucking hate you.

153
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:05,625
Why?

154
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:09,098
"Why?" "Why?"

155
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:13,365
Because people that are scared
make me sick.

156
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:15,507
You think that I'm scared?

157
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:18,235
I don't know, Beth.
Are you scared?

158
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:20,209
Hmm? What happened to you?

159
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,212
Tell me.

160
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,447
You gonna say
any-fucking-thing? No?

161
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:27,951
No, I can play that game, too.

162
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:30,013
Cool.

163
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:32,386
I'll go back to bed.

164
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:58,846
* Before each other's face *

165
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:08,054
* Look into my eyes *

166
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:17,931
* Is it still there? *

167
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:32,610
* All that time *

168
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,587
Maddie?

169
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:19,227
Hi, Dad.

170
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:35,774
A friend of yours, Greg Hicks,
got married last week.

171
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:36,609
Did you hear?

172
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:37,976
No.

173
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,380
Yeah.

174
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:42,249
They had the wedding
over at the Episcopal church

175
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:44,481
on, uh, Fitz Morris street.

176
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,717
Hurricane knocked down everything
on that street except that church.

177
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,895
Is everything all right with you?

178
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,299
Yeah, same as usual.

179
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:59,927
That's good. That's good.

180
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:03,938
You need money?

181
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:07,377
Dad, I didn't come here
to ask you for money.

182
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:08,672
Well, I know you didn't.

183
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,442
I just -- but it's okay if you --
if you need it.

184
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:15,213
I don't know how much I can give,

185
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,982
'cause your mother's insurance
got pulled again.

186
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,523
Who's there, Steven?

187
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:24,220
Tell me I'm not dreaming.

188
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:25,522
Hi, Mom.

189
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:27,895
My angel's come home!.

190
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:31,763
Look at you!
Look how long your hair is!

191
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,771
Steven, why didn't you come
and tell me my little angel was here?

192
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:36,568
Well, I thought you were sleeping.

193
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,609
Sleep? Who has time for sleep?

194
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,173
Steven, did you get her some food?

195
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:46,115
Well, I -- I didn't think
that she wanted any.

196
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:47,913
Yeah, no, I'm -- I'm not hungry.

197
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:48,918
Oh, nonsense.

198
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,989
You sit right here,
and daddy will get you some food.

199
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:53,421
You are skinny as a scarecrow!

200
00:19:58,163 --> 00:20:00,859
Daddy said you're doing
some telemarketing.

201
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,001
How is that going?

202
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:05,797
Uh, it's fine.

203
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:07,599
Oh, Maddie, please tell me

204
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:10,300
you're not still living
in that awful French Quarter.

205
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:13,672
I am still living
in that awful French Quarter.

206
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:16,780
Someone like you should not be
living in a place like that.

207
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,043
It's enough to tempt anyone.

208
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:20,617
-ls that meat?
-Uh-huh.

209
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:21,981
I don't feel like red meat.

210
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:24,385
My blood is thick today.
It needs poultry.

211
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,724
Want me to make you some chicken?

212
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,726
It's not very attractive
being so skinny, Maddie.

213
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:32,194
It makes your face sink in.

214
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:36,528
A woman should be soft and round,
the way God made her.

215
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,902
Mmm!

216
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:43,270
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

217
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,135
Mmm. Meat, yes.

218
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:53,080
Tell him everyone that you love.

219
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:57,518
Dear God, I love my mama,
my daddy, my uncle Pete.

220
00:20:57,623 --> 00:21:01,218
Tell God you love His only son,
our Lord Jesus Christ.

221
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:04,056
Dear God, I love your only son,
Jesus Christ.

222
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:06,153
Our Lord Jesus Christ.

223
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,460
Our Lord Jesus Christ.

224
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:11,297
Tell Him to forgive you
for the sins you have committed.

225
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,732
What sins, Mama?

226
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:14,396
Tell Him your sins.

227
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:16,474
But I haven't sinned.

228
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:19,544
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Ghost.

229
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:23,741
Watch over my daughter, and
cleanse her of her wrong doings.

230
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:15,732
Put your hand on the Bible

231
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:18,394
and swear your life over
to Jesus Christ.

232
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:21,301
-I don't want to.
-Do it.

233
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:25,871
I swear my life over
to Jesus Christ.

234
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,523
I would have put
fresh sheets on the bed

235
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:45,186
had I known you were coming.

236
00:22:46,998 --> 00:22:48,431
It's okay. I'm not staying.

237
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:50,959
Why not?

238
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:53,037
Because I have my own place.

239
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:56,630
You're being tempted living
in that awful French Quarter.

240
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:58,369
Oh, God, Mother, don't start.

241
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,943
You want to spend your days
in eternal hell?

242
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,174
As long as you're not there.

243
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:06,044
Listen to the filth
coming out of your mouth.

244
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:08,051
What has happened to you?

245
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:09,815
I wonder.

246
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:12,583
You're a heathen! Look at you!

247
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:17,025
I can see it in your eyes.
He's robbed your soul!

248
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:19,860
Dolly, come to bed now.

249
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:23,731
I can see it in her eyes, Steven!
She's got him crawling all over her!

250
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:25,393
Listen to how she speaks to me!

251
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:27,335
It's all right.
You just go on to bed.

252
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:31,307
Go on to bed. It's all right.
It's all right.

253
00:23:37,282 --> 00:23:39,375
She's sick, honey.
She doesn't mean it.

254
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,810
You're still making excuses for her?

255
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:43,420
I'm not making excuses.

256
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:44,921
You're defending her.

257
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:47,617
Well, she loves you.

258
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,292
She thinks I'm Satan.

259
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,454
Oh, that's just --
that's just her sickness talking.

260
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:53,826
She doesn't really think that.

261
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:55,967
Well, she needs medication!

262
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:57,034
Just look -- just --

263
00:23:57,135 --> 00:23:58,625
Sweetheart, just --

264
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:00,932
Hey, keep your voice down.

265
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,336
Dad, why are you still
protecting her?

266
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:05,942
Well, I'm not protecting her, l...

267
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,746
Yeah.

268
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:10,178
Whatever.

269
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,749
Please, sweetheart --

270
00:24:11,883 --> 00:24:14,784
Just, Maddie,
please stay the night.

271
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,154
We never get to see you.

272
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:26,153
I have work tomorrow.

273
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:46,283
Mama?!

274
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:49,580
Mama?!

275
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:54,015
Mama! Please!

276
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:56,320
I didn't do anything wrong!

277
00:24:57,429 --> 00:25:00,296
Please don't leave me in here!

278
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:03,563
I didn't do anything wrong!

279
00:25:23,321 --> 00:25:26,848
Okay, and here,
we'll just, once again,

280
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:28,892
use the little crisscross strokes.

281
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,255
That's a nice little gray sky there.

282
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,763
So, tell you what --
let's take some of that same color...

283
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:36,494
Just the black and the blue.
That's all we need.

284
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:38,226
Come on.
You know you want it.

285
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,002
You can add more of the black.

286
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:42,630
You can gray it down
or leave it brighter.

287
00:25:42,774 --> 00:25:45,265
Dang! 89!

288
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:47,074
Lexy, shut up!

289
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:49,169
-Grace Matthews.
-Margaret.

290
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:49,940
Be right back.

291
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:53,211
Margaret, don't --
don't give me evil stares.

292
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,410
Margaret Jones.

293
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,580
Alexis, Grace, Margaret,

294
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:02,091
I have a very exciting project
I want to talk to you about.

295
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:03,956
Can you please all come
to the meeting area?

296
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,324
Alexis, shut up!

297
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:06,727
Just for about 1 0 minutes.

298
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:08,958
Um, I was watching that.

299
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,261
Sorry.

300
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:12,233
Grace, could you please
come over here?

301
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,497
Elizabeth! I was watching that.

302
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:15,698
Alexis!

303
00:26:15,807 --> 00:26:18,275
Elizabeth, I'm --
I'm playing a game.

304
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:20,172
1, 2, 3, 4...

305
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:21,267
Alexis!

306
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,716
Okay.

307
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:31,254
I have three video cameras.

308
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:35,120
I want you to use these
to express yourselves --

309
00:26:35,226 --> 00:26:37,319
any thoughts or feelings
that you may have.

310
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:38,487
Like a -- like a diary?

311
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:41,191
Yes, like a diary.
Could you please cross your legs?

312
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:44,063
Thank you.
Here's your camera.

313
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:46,535
Here you go.

314
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:49,266
I don't have any thoughts.

315
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:53,874
I don't have any thoughts.
I don't have any memories.

316
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:55,742
I was watching the fucking TV.

317
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:57,678
I'm sure you'll think of something.

318
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,682
That is not okay.
That's inappropriate.

319
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:00,773
Pick that up, Margaret, now.

320
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:03,615
Margaret, pick it up,
'cause that's very inappropriate.

321
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:05,314
Pick it up.
Margaret, pick it up.

322
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:06,447
Pick it up. Pick it up.

323
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:07,855
Take the camera, Margaret.

324
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:10,427
I don't want to do this project
with any of you guys!

325
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:12,894
All right, that is not okay.
That is not okay. Sit down!

326
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:15,296
It is okay, okay?!
Get out of my seat!

327
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:21,368
It's not necessary, really.
She's fine.

328
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:22,770
Sit down.

329
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:24,739
I'll be waiting for you, sweetheart.

330
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:25,707
Shh. Shh.

331
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:28,645
Shh. It's okay. It's okay.

332
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:43,684
Ow.

333
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:15,216
30 tapes, 30 days.

334
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,638
How long have you been
having these blackouts

335
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,274
that you keep talking about?

336
00:30:23,054 --> 00:30:27,013
Since I was 1 2... or 1 3.

337
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:29,820
And what's the longest
you've ever blacked out?

338
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:31,225
Two months.

339
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:33,091
Two months?

340
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:37,496
What happened?

341
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:42,270
I... woke up...

342
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:45,771
In New York on a subway.

343
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:49,709
And do you know
how you got there?

344
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:54,317
No, I don't remember anything.

345
00:30:56,087 --> 00:31:00,148
And how do you know that you were
in New York for two months?

346
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:05,987
Um, because I found
a bus ticket in my bag

347
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:09,396
that said it was
from New Orleans to New York.

348
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:15,162
It must be really scary
to not be able to remember.

349
00:31:22,113 --> 00:31:24,581
I can deal with it.

350
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:29,577
Why do you think you have to deal
with everything all by yourself?

351
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:43,565
Do you think I'm crazy?

352
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:48,837
I think you should
check yourself in to the hospital.

353
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:13,387
This is the first time in 13 years...

354
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:17,222
that I haven't taken medication.

355
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,567
I don't know...

356
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:29,232
I don't know
what's really happening. Uh...

357
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:38,815
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

358
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,716
I know that...

359
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:46,218
I know that you can hear me.

360
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,890
I'm in my apartment right now...

361
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:55,457
And, uh -- and...

362
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,998
I don't --

363
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:05,838
I don't really remember...

364
00:34:05,943 --> 00:34:07,274
much of, like, where I've --

365
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,744
where I've been
and what I've been doing,

366
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:12,372
and, uh...

367
00:34:14,752 --> 00:34:17,084
It's kind of a scary feeling.

368
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:22,318
The first time I tried to kill myself,
I was, uh, 1 3,

369
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:26,454
and my mom had
these crowns of thorns.

370
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:31,797
Um, and she had this particular one
that was really special to her.

371
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:34,929
And -- and so I put that one
on my head.

372
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:40,136
And I cut my wrists and my ankles,
and I laid down on the floor

373
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:43,805
so that I was beautiful and peaceful,
just like Jesus.

374
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,941
And, um -- and I thought
when she found me,

375
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:49,645
she'd be really happy,
because she loves Him so much.

376
00:34:49,787 --> 00:34:52,620
Um, and then she --

377
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:56,352
she came into the room
and she saw me lying there.

378
00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:59,089
And, um...

379
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:02,030
And she was really mad.

380
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:06,035
And -- and that's when I knew
that she'd never --

381
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:09,470
never love me
as much as she loves Jesus.

382
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:19,416
The first time
I tried to commit suicide,

383
00:35:19,517 --> 00:35:22,782
I was 16.

384
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:27,319
I got pregnant
and had to have an abortion.

385
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:33,060
I didn't have any money,
and I couldn't tell my parents,

386
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:39,262
so I had to have it done by this guy
who said he could do it real cheap.

387
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:43,306
But he messed up,
and now I can't have kids.

388
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:49,570
So, uh, here, Elizabeth.
Here's a little thought for you.

389
00:35:51,048 --> 00:35:53,608
Every time you walk into the room...

390
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:56,209
I want to take your fucking face

391
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,550
and smash it against the ground.

392
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:01,547
Margaret, what are you doing?

393
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:03,387
-What are you doing? That is --
-Ahh!

394
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,621
This is not funny.

395
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:10,958
Fucker!
Why don't you let me do it?!

396
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:31,046
I have no -- no concept of --
of time or what time is.

397
00:36:31,155 --> 00:36:33,350
I don't understand it.

398
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:37,788
I mean, is it even real?
Because I don't remember...

399
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:40,989
I don't remember so many things.

400
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:49,868
What's your magical power
going to be?

401
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:51,464
I don't want one.

402
00:36:51,576 --> 00:36:53,942
But you have to.
Come on, just pick one.

403
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:57,271
I want to be invisible.

404
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:59,906
But if you're invisible,
then I can't see you.

405
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:02,575
And if I can't see you,
we can't be friends.

406
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,948
We're friends?

407
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,751
Madison!
Madison, where are you?!

408
00:37:06,857 --> 00:37:07,915
I have to go.

409
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:09,582
You don't have to go.
We can hide here.

410
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:10,888
She won't find us.

411
00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:14,658
Madison Ann Walker,
I'm going to count to three!

412
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:19,702
Madison?

413
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:21,863
Huh?

414
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:24,098
Where were you just now?

415
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:27,900
Madison.

416
00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:29,803
What?

417
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:31,878
Come sit down.

418
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,730
Why can't you look at me?

419
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:50,631
I don't know.

420
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:53,733
Well, if you ever feel uncomfortable,

421
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:56,068
you tell me, and we'll fix it.

422
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:04,804
Why are you being so nice to me?

423
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:09,280
Hasn't anyone ever been
nice to you?

424
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:18,360
We'll just, once again,
use the little crisscross strokes.

425
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:21,624
You can add more of the black.

426
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:25,031
You can gray it down
or leave it brighter.

427
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,269
It all depends on you.

428
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:30,099
You want to paint my nails for me?

429
00:38:30,274 --> 00:38:33,243
Is it -- is it at all possible

430
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:35,335
that you can not be a skank
for one second

431
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:37,073
when I'm watching my show?

432
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:39,577
No.

433
00:38:39,684 --> 00:38:42,209
Get off my fucking couch.

434
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,878
Make me.

435
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:45,044
Yeah?

436
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:47,215
Margaret, come get your meds.

437
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,657
Just, once again,
use a little crisscross stroke.

438
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,125
-Bitch.
-Mm-hmm.

439
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:54,254
Checkmate.

440
00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:55,696
Checkmate.

441
00:38:55,866 --> 00:38:58,300
Checkmate. Checkmate.

442
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:08,273
Checkmate, checkmate,
checkmate! Aaaaaah!

443
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:09,869
Aah! Aaaaaah!

444
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,413
Checkmate.

445
00:39:19,256 --> 00:39:21,053
Psst!

446
00:39:22,426 --> 00:39:24,894
She can't help you.

447
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:30,090
Your precious doctor...

448
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:32,863
That isn't even a doctor.

449
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:35,939
She's just gonna make you worse.

450
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:38,869
And what makes you the expert?

451
00:39:40,077 --> 00:39:42,671
Well, I've been here the longest.

452
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:46,080
I can see why.

453
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:49,980
You're gonna need me.

454
00:39:50,087 --> 00:39:51,384
How's that?

455
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:55,047
-Leave her alone, Margaret.
-Shut up! You'll be the first to go.

456
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,921
You don't scare me.

457
00:39:57,094 --> 00:39:58,721
I bet I can.

458
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:00,057
Aaaaaaaaaahh!

459
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:02,132
Aah! Stop it, Margaret!
Leave me alone!

460
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,133
Please leave me alone!
Let me go!

461
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:08,796
No! No! No! Aah!

462
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:10,133
Margaret, give it back!

463
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,072
Margaret, give it back! Stop it!

464
00:40:58,689 --> 00:41:00,247
I don't think anybody
knows me anymore.

465
00:41:00,357 --> 00:41:01,881
I'm -- I'm a stranger --

466
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:03,857
I'm a stranger to everyone, and I'm --

467
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,691
I'm a stranger to myself.

468
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:26,312
Margaret, you're not meant
to be in my room.

469
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:29,477
Go now.
You're not meant to be in here.

470
00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:31,919
You know that she's gonna...

471
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:36,015
watch those tapes and use them
to keep you locked in here, right?

472
00:41:36,126 --> 00:41:37,753
Margaret, can you --
can you go now?

473
00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:39,727
What? You think she cares?

474
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:42,889
Can you please stop this
and leave me alone?

475
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:45,092
Can you -- can you go now,
please, Margaret?

476
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:47,500
Margaret, please, can you go now?

477
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:50,574
Please leave me alone.
Otherwise, I'm gonna tell.

478
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:52,835
I'll tell. I will. You know I will.

479
00:41:52,943 --> 00:41:54,570
If you tell, then --

480
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:57,203
Then you're gonna go
where all the bad girls go.

481
00:41:57,314 --> 00:41:59,407
No. No.
Because I'm not bad, Margaret.

482
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:00,506
You are very bad.

483
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:01,812
No, I'm not. I'm not bad.

484
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:02,977
-You're bad.
-Shh. Shh.

485
00:42:03,087 --> 00:42:05,715
You're the one who's bad,
Margaret, not me.

486
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:07,323
I'm not -- I'm not bad.

487
00:42:07,424 --> 00:42:08,448
I want to talk.

488
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:10,584
No, please, I'm --

489
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:12,025
Just leave me alone, please.

490
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:14,130
Hey...

491
00:42:14,231 --> 00:42:17,928
Tell me what that holy man
did to you in the car.

492
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:19,535
Margaret,
please leave me alone now.

493
00:42:19,637 --> 00:42:20,797
Did he make you feel good?

494
00:42:20,905 --> 00:42:22,532
-No. Please.
-Come on. Show me.

495
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,471
-No, please. I don't want to.
-Show me what he did.

496
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:25,803
Please, can you
leave me alone now?

497
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:27,935
-Did he make you feel good?
-Please, no, leave me alone.

498
00:42:28,112 --> 00:42:29,739
-No, no, no.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, he did.

499
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:31,337
No! No!

500
00:42:31,448 --> 00:42:33,245
-Margaret, no!
-Shh!

501
00:42:40,591 --> 00:42:42,559
Please get rid of her.
She's ruining everything.

502
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:44,353
Stop freaking out.
She's just crying, all right?

503
00:42:44,461 --> 00:42:46,019
All right, all right.
I'll go, I'll go.

504
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:52,262
Whoo!

505
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:05,846
Uh...

506
00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:09,742
Everything's really blurry.

507
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:15,450
Time's blurry.
My vision's blurry.

508
00:43:29,707 --> 00:43:33,404
Alexis, you want to play unicorns?!

509
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:37,412
I'll play unicorns with you!

510
00:43:37,514 --> 00:43:39,607
Elizabeth!

511
00:43:39,717 --> 00:43:44,211
The sun turned black
from the face of the Lord,

512
00:43:44,321 --> 00:43:46,653
and it turned black!

513
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:49,452
It turned black, the sun.

514
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,619
How can the sun turn black?!

515
00:43:53,063 --> 00:43:54,291
The sun!

516
00:43:54,398 --> 00:43:57,799
Yes, Mom!

517
00:43:57,901 --> 00:44:00,301
I never do anything right.

518
00:44:00,404 --> 00:44:02,998
I thought that you liked that.

519
00:44:03,173 --> 00:44:06,040
* Can anybody hear me? *

520
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:11,103
Alexis, want to come play now,
you stupid ass?!

521
00:44:11,215 --> 00:44:12,773
Come play in here!

522
00:44:21,558 --> 00:44:24,959
You really enjoy
this circus act, don't you?

523
00:44:25,796 --> 00:44:27,320
Why don't you just die?

524
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:29,398
I asked you not to go
into Alexis' room.

525
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:33,664
And I watched as the sixth seal,

526
00:44:33,771 --> 00:44:36,103
and there was
a great, big earthquake,

527
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:39,175
and the sun turned to black,

528
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:42,107
Iike sackcloth made of goat hair.

529
00:44:42,212 --> 00:44:44,077
Is that Revelation?

530
00:44:45,783 --> 00:44:48,684
Did I ever tell you how my mom
used to put me in the closet

531
00:44:48,786 --> 00:44:55,055
with the Bible every night
and make me memorize verses?

532
00:44:56,527 --> 00:45:00,793
And you want to know
what would happen if I didn't?

533
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,361
Well?

534
00:45:05,235 --> 00:45:07,533
This is what you want,
right, Elizabeth?

535
00:45:07,638 --> 00:45:10,573
You want me to tell you
all of my problems...

536
00:45:11,341 --> 00:45:16,643
so we don't have to talk about
what happened in your closet.

537
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:21,245
You know I know.

538
00:45:21,351 --> 00:45:24,184
And that's why you hate me.

539
00:45:24,822 --> 00:45:26,050
I don't hate you.

540
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:39,566
I don't even remember --

541
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:41,695
I don't even remember
what I was like on medication.

542
00:45:41,805 --> 00:45:45,241
So, I mean, was I even a person?
Maybe I wasn't even real.

543
00:45:45,342 --> 00:45:48,334
I mean, if you -- if you don't --
if you're not yourself, right,

544
00:45:48,445 --> 00:45:49,673
I mean, then what --
what's the point?

545
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:51,543
Like, I mean, what...

546
00:45:51,648 --> 00:45:55,550
If you don't remember, I mean,
you're not really real.

547
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:18,305
Hey.

548
00:46:19,009 --> 00:46:21,000
Can I come in?

549
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:26,105
Do you want a cigarette?

550
00:46:26,216 --> 00:46:27,478
I don't smoke.

551
00:46:27,584 --> 00:46:29,609
Well, you might as well.

552
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,450
There's nothing else
to do around here.

553
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,857
You know, I can get you
whatever you want.

554
00:46:45,836 --> 00:46:47,303
What do you think I want?

555
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,405
Money...

556
00:46:49,506 --> 00:46:50,632
Sex...

557
00:46:51,909 --> 00:46:53,035
Fun...

558
00:46:53,777 --> 00:46:55,904
You want to get high?

559
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,148
Are you insane?

560
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:06,119
You know Mike, Mr. Nurse man?

561
00:47:06,857 --> 00:47:09,087
See, I blow him...

562
00:47:09,193 --> 00:47:12,128
And he gives me whatever I want.

563
00:47:15,799 --> 00:47:17,130
Trust me.

564
00:47:22,973 --> 00:47:25,339
I'm on your side.

565
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:28,102
What?

566
00:47:28,212 --> 00:47:29,873
I said...

567
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,744
I'm the one that's on your side.

568
00:47:34,484 --> 00:47:37,180
The others don't give a shit
about you.

569
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:40,490
The others?

570
00:47:41,391 --> 00:47:43,791
They're the ones that aren't real.

571
00:47:49,233 --> 00:47:50,063
I...

572
00:47:51,635 --> 00:47:54,195
How do I know you're real?

573
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:57,402
I'm here, aren't l?

574
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:02,529
Everything okay?

575
00:50:03,734 --> 00:50:05,497
It's finished if you want to buy it.

576
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:08,736
Amazing, isn't it?

577
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:11,034
When you start to see yourself
in everything?

578
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:13,005
Huh?

579
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:15,408
I said are you sure you're okay?

580
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:18,037
Uh, yeah, I'm okay.

581
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:21,943
It'll come around for you soon,
Madison.

582
00:50:32,929 --> 00:50:33,759
Madison.

583
00:50:44,941 --> 00:50:46,568
Madison.

584
00:51:48,505 --> 00:51:50,439
Hello?

585
00:51:53,477 --> 00:51:55,911
Hello?!

586
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:58,808
Let me go!

587
00:52:30,247 --> 00:52:31,976
Please stop.

588
00:52:32,215 --> 00:52:33,614
Please.

589
00:52:33,717 --> 00:52:36,083
Make it stop!

590
00:52:36,186 --> 00:52:39,883
Please make it stop!

591
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:43,386
It's for your own good.

592
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:45,757
But, Mama,
I didn't do anything wrong.

593
00:52:45,862 --> 00:52:47,796
You're talking to people
who aren't there.

594
00:52:47,898 --> 00:52:49,195
It's the work of Satan.

595
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:50,890
But no one's there, Mama.

596
00:52:51,067 --> 00:52:53,160
Come put your hands over the sink.

597
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:54,325
No, Mama.

598
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:56,199
Come put your hands
over the sink.

599
00:52:56,373 --> 00:52:57,840
Please, Mama.

600
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:00,499
Put your hands over the sink!

601
00:53:14,925 --> 00:53:16,392
What happened?

602
00:53:16,493 --> 00:53:17,960
It hurts.

603
00:53:18,061 --> 00:53:19,050
What hurts?

604
00:53:19,162 --> 00:53:21,528
-Please, it really burns.
-What?

605
00:53:21,631 --> 00:53:23,826
It hurts. The water -- it's so hot.

606
00:53:23,934 --> 00:53:25,162
There's no water.

607
00:53:25,268 --> 00:53:27,930
-There is. Please make it stop.
-No, there's no water.

608
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:30,097
-Please make it stop.
-What's wrong?

609
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:33,335
I have to burn.
I have to burn because I'm bad.

610
00:53:33,443 --> 00:53:35,274
-Who said that?
-I have to burn.

611
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:36,936
-Who said that?
-I'm going to hell.

612
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:38,139
You're not going to hell.

613
00:53:38,248 --> 00:53:39,340
-I am.
-No, you're not. No.

614
00:53:39,449 --> 00:53:41,076
I am. I'm going to hell.

615
00:53:41,184 --> 00:53:42,651
No, you're not going to hell.

616
00:53:42,752 --> 00:53:44,276
-I am.
-No.

617
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:46,514
Good people do not go to hell.

618
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:49,158
Do you know what I do
when I have scary thoughts?

619
00:53:49,259 --> 00:53:50,419
What?

620
00:53:50,527 --> 00:53:52,620
I close my eyes...

621
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:56,324
and I think of the happiest place
I know.

622
00:53:57,467 --> 00:54:01,460
But -- but I don't have
any happy places.

623
00:54:06,042 --> 00:54:08,101
Everything's crashing on me...

624
00:54:08,211 --> 00:54:10,873
Like waves. It's like tidal waves.

625
00:54:12,816 --> 00:54:15,284
I feel like I'm drowning.

626
00:54:29,132 --> 00:54:30,565
Our Father...

627
00:54:30,667 --> 00:54:31,998
Who art in heaven...

628
00:54:33,036 --> 00:54:35,368
Hallowed be Thy name.

629
00:54:35,472 --> 00:54:37,804
Thy kingdom come...

630
00:54:37,907 --> 00:54:40,467
Madison, Madison,
come and play with me.

631
00:54:40,577 --> 00:54:41,669
I can't.

632
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:44,440
See, you're talking again
to imaginary people.

633
00:54:44,547 --> 00:54:47,311
But, Mama, she's right there.

634
00:54:49,419 --> 00:54:51,319
Madison, come on.

635
00:54:51,488 --> 00:54:52,648
Let's play.

636
00:55:09,272 --> 00:55:12,571
Will you tell me more
about the little girl?

637
00:55:12,676 --> 00:55:14,667
No.

638
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:18,640
Why don't you want
to talk about her?

639
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:21,613
I just -- I just...

640
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:26,587
I, uh -- can -- can we talk
about something else?

641
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:29,659
What is it about her that makes you
feel so uncomfortable?

642
00:55:33,963 --> 00:55:35,897
I'm not supposed to talk
about the little girl.

643
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:39,059
Why? Why aren't you supposed
to talk about the little girl?

644
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:45,835
'Cause she'll get mad at me.

645
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:49,972
Who?
Who's gonna get mad at you?

646
00:55:51,881 --> 00:55:54,645
Please don't make me talk about it.

647
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:57,543
Madison.

648
00:55:58,888 --> 00:56:00,549
Madison.

649
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:05,024
Madison.

650
00:56:05,128 --> 00:56:09,497
My name isn't Madison,
you fucking bitch.

651
00:56:11,067 --> 00:56:15,231
You push too hard
with your stupid little questions.

652
00:56:20,677 --> 00:56:23,908
You're trying to break her.
I can feel it.

653
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:26,708
I'm trying to help you.

654
00:56:26,816 --> 00:56:28,249
You're trying to help me?

655
00:56:28,418 --> 00:56:30,613
I don't need help.
You need help.

656
00:56:32,455 --> 00:56:34,389
Aah!

657
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:39,226
Oh, my God.
No, no, no, no.

658
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:41,591
What's wrong?
What's going on?

659
00:56:41,765 --> 00:56:43,357
-Stop it.
-What?

660
00:56:43,466 --> 00:56:45,366
I can't talk to you.

661
00:56:45,535 --> 00:56:47,264
Why?

662
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:49,270
Because she's gonna get mad at me.

663
00:56:49,372 --> 00:56:50,862
Who's gonna get mad at you?

664
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,440
She's gonna hurt me if I tell.

665
00:56:53,610 --> 00:56:54,975
Nobody's gonna get mad at you.

666
00:56:55,145 --> 00:56:57,739
Madison, it's all right.

667
00:56:58,448 --> 00:57:00,382
What are you doing?

668
00:57:03,052 --> 00:57:04,917
What just happened?

669
00:57:06,389 --> 00:57:08,220
It's okay. You're gonna be okay.

670
00:57:08,324 --> 00:57:09,689
-No, I'm not gonna be okay.
-Yes, you are.

671
00:57:09,793 --> 00:57:12,023
This is not okay,
because you're making me worse,

672
00:57:12,128 --> 00:57:13,755
-And I really don't want to --
-You're gonna be okay.

673
00:57:13,863 --> 00:57:15,455
It's not okay.
You're making me worse.

674
00:57:15,632 --> 00:57:17,429
I know this is really hard.

675
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,864
You know what's fucking hard?
You know what's hard, Beth?

676
00:57:19,969 --> 00:57:22,062
Is that I don't know
what you're talking about.

677
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:23,832
That's good. That's good.
You're getting angry.

678
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:24,964
That's really good.

679
00:57:25,141 --> 00:57:28,577
When is the last time
you remember getting angry?

680
00:57:31,714 --> 00:57:33,648
You never needed
to get angry before

681
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:35,217
because there was somebody else

682
00:57:35,318 --> 00:57:36,910
who was always
getting angry for you.

683
00:57:37,086 --> 00:57:39,577
-What are you saying?
-Somebody was protecting you.

684
00:57:39,689 --> 00:57:42,715
-God, I knew this would happen.
-What would happen?

685
00:57:44,828 --> 00:57:47,991
That I would trust you,
and you would screw me over.

686
00:57:48,164 --> 00:57:49,859
Madison, look at me.
No, I can help you.

687
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:51,399
Don't say my name.
Don't say my name.

688
00:57:51,501 --> 00:57:52,934
Look at me! Madison!

689
00:57:53,036 --> 00:57:56,335
Are you deaf, you bitch?!
I said, "Don't say my name."

690
00:57:58,842 --> 00:58:02,141
Why can't you just
leave it alone, Beth?

691
00:58:02,245 --> 00:58:03,940
What? Do you think I'm deaf?

692
00:58:04,047 --> 00:58:06,345
You think I don't hear
what you say about me?

693
00:58:06,449 --> 00:58:07,609
I'm trying to help you.

694
00:58:08,885 --> 00:58:09,544
Shut up.

695
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:12,348
You called me,
and I came here to help you.

696
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:16,156
I didn't call you.

697
00:58:16,259 --> 00:58:17,624
I --

698
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:20,287
I hate you.

699
00:58:20,396 --> 00:58:22,296
She called you.

700
00:58:22,398 --> 00:58:25,856
She's gonna die.
She is gonna die.

701
00:58:26,536 --> 00:58:28,367
You're gonna die.

702
00:58:28,471 --> 00:58:29,802
Stop.

703
00:58:29,906 --> 00:58:33,342
She isn't real.
She isn't real.

704
00:58:34,444 --> 00:58:36,173
I'm real.

705
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:38,174
She isn't real.

706
00:58:38,281 --> 00:58:40,306
Real.

707
00:58:40,483 --> 00:58:42,383
It's okay.

708
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:46,655
Just fucking stop.

709
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:49,484
Madison, let me be there for you.

710
00:58:49,592 --> 00:58:52,026
Just let me be here.

711
00:58:58,268 --> 00:58:59,860
Come here.

712
00:59:02,605 --> 00:59:04,402
It's okay.

713
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:07,608
It's okay.

714
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:11,612
It's okay. It's okay.

715
00:59:12,315 --> 00:59:14,408
It's okay.

716
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,888
It's okay.

717
00:59:19,422 --> 00:59:21,947
-It's okay.
-I don't --

718
00:59:22,058 --> 00:59:24,288
It's okay.

719
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:28,959
"What is real?",
asked the rabbit.

720
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:31,727
"Real isn't how you're made,"
said the skin horse.

721
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:35,428
"It's a thing that happens to you."

722
00:59:35,538 --> 00:59:38,336
-My turn?
-Go ahead.

723
00:59:38,441 --> 00:59:39,430
"Does it hurt?"

724
00:59:39,542 --> 00:59:41,339
"Sometimes.

725
00:59:41,444 --> 00:59:45,312
When you are real,
you don't mind being hurt."

726
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:47,042
"Does it happen all at once?"

727
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:49,380
"lt doesn't happen all at once.

728
00:59:49,485 --> 00:59:53,251
You become.
It takes a long time.

729
00:59:53,356 --> 00:59:56,519
That's why it doesn't often happen
to people who break easily,

730
00:59:56,626 --> 00:59:58,719
or who have sharp edges,

731
00:59:58,828 --> 01:00:01,661
or who have to be carefully kept.

732
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:03,857
Generally...

733
01:00:04,867 --> 01:00:06,892
By the time you are real,

734
01:00:07,003 --> 01:00:09,267
most of your hair
has been loved off,

735
01:00:09,372 --> 01:00:11,306
and your eyes drop out,

736
01:00:11,407 --> 01:00:15,207
and you get loose in the joints
and very shabby.

737
01:00:15,311 --> 01:00:17,939
But these things don't matter at all,

738
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:21,016
because once you are real,
you can't be ugly,

739
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:24,553
except to people
who don't understand."

740
01:00:26,589 --> 01:00:29,080
-Mama?
-Yes, Maddie?

741
01:00:29,192 --> 01:00:31,126
Am I real?

742
01:01:00,623 --> 01:01:03,524
I get a lot of requests
from people wanting to do...

743
01:01:03,693 --> 01:01:05,718
Checkmate.

744
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:07,227
So I thought today...

745
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:09,457
Hey, Madison.

746
01:01:09,565 --> 01:01:11,726
Madison?

747
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:13,529
Madison, what's wrong?

748
01:01:13,636 --> 01:01:15,001
What do you want, Alexis?

749
01:01:15,104 --> 01:01:16,537
You want to come play with me?

750
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:17,663
Nope.

751
01:01:17,774 --> 01:01:19,799
Why? What's wrong?

752
01:01:19,909 --> 01:01:22,571
Nothing's wrong.

753
01:01:22,745 --> 01:01:25,805
You always say nothing's wrong
when something is always wrong.

754
01:01:25,982 --> 01:01:27,574
Why don't you come play with me?
Come on.

755
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:28,548
Just one game.

756
01:01:28,651 --> 01:01:30,141
-Do you see those people right there?
-Yeah.

757
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:32,620
They look like
they're having a lot of fun.

758
01:01:32,722 --> 01:01:33,814
I think you should go play with them.

759
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:35,582
No, I want to play with you.

760
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:36,420
Checkmate!

761
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:39,051
Okay, okay.
Well, um, uh, we can play...

762
01:01:39,162 --> 01:01:40,129
Yeah?

763
01:01:40,229 --> 01:01:41,321
-Hide and go seek.
-Okay.

764
01:01:41,431 --> 01:01:42,591
All right, so you're gonna go hide.

765
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:45,293
No, we did that the other day,
and you didn't come and find me.

766
01:01:45,401 --> 01:01:46,959
Madison, you didn't come.

767
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:49,061
I've got a better idea.
Why don't we go play horses?

768
01:01:49,172 --> 01:01:52,505
Come on. We can ride horses,
like we always used to ride horses.

769
01:01:52,608 --> 01:01:54,667
-We can ride horses.
-No, there's no horses here.

770
01:01:54,777 --> 01:01:56,608
What are you talking about?
We used to always ride horses.

771
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:58,180
Yeah, well, we're
in a hospital right now,

772
01:01:58,281 --> 01:02:00,613
and I've never been on a horse
in my entire life.

773
01:02:00,783 --> 01:02:01,647
Do you not remember?

774
01:02:01,751 --> 01:02:03,844
Do you not remember
all those times we played horses?

775
01:02:03,953 --> 01:02:05,511
-Please stop.
-Why are you being so weird?

776
01:02:05,688 --> 01:02:07,588
-Please stop. Please stop.
-Come on, one game, Madison.

777
01:02:07,690 --> 01:02:09,555
Why are you being so weird?
You don't remember anything?

778
01:02:09,659 --> 01:02:11,354
What do you mean you don't
remember?! You do remember!

779
01:02:11,461 --> 01:02:12,758
We used to always
play horses together!

780
01:02:12,862 --> 01:02:14,261
-Please stop.
-You do remember!

781
01:02:14,363 --> 01:02:15,387
-Stop it.
-You do! You do!

782
01:02:15,498 --> 01:02:16,624
Shut the fuck up,

783
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:19,359
or I'm gonna smash your head
against that wall, okay?!

784
01:02:19,535 --> 01:02:21,503
-You say the F-word all the time.
-Fuck, fuck, fuck!

785
01:02:21,604 --> 01:02:23,037
Stop saying the F-word
the whole time!

786
01:02:23,139 --> 01:02:24,868
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

787
01:02:24,974 --> 01:02:26,737
Go back to your couch!

788
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:28,774
Do -- do I see a little bit
of personality in you?

789
01:02:28,945 --> 01:02:30,640
Oh, yeah?
A little personality right there?

790
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:31,873
Yeah, yeah. Fine.

791
01:02:32,048 --> 01:02:34,608
Come on, tough girl.
Come on, tough girl!

792
01:02:34,784 --> 01:02:36,547
-Shut the fuck up!
-Oh, yeah.

793
01:02:36,719 --> 01:02:38,448
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on! Come on!

794
01:02:38,621 --> 01:02:39,349
Fuck you!

795
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:42,914
Good job.

796
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:48,290
Bitches.

797
01:02:48,397 --> 01:02:50,228
Madison, you did it.

798
01:02:50,333 --> 01:02:51,698
You did it.

799
01:02:51,801 --> 01:02:53,098
Don't tell Margaret.

800
01:02:59,742 --> 01:03:01,710
Madison!

801
01:03:01,811 --> 01:03:04,405
Madison, where are you?!

802
01:03:58,634 --> 01:03:59,191
Madison!

803
01:03:59,368 --> 01:04:01,063
You want to spend
your days in eternal hell?

804
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:07,607
Make it stop!

805
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:09,803
Make it stop!

806
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:14,543
Well, I was sitting
in the front in his station wagon,

807
01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:19,986
and he had, like, um,
these red plastic seat covers.

808
01:04:20,089 --> 01:04:21,920
And it made a noise when he moved.

809
01:04:22,024 --> 01:04:27,656
Um, and there was a plastic
Jesus figurine on the dashboard.

810
01:04:28,898 --> 01:04:30,991
I know what you want me to say.

811
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:34,092
What is it that you
think I want you to say?

812
01:04:36,572 --> 01:04:40,599
That they took advantage of me
because I was only 1 3.

813
01:04:47,316 --> 01:04:50,285
I would rather slit my wrist...

814
01:04:50,386 --> 01:04:55,085
or be fucking hung upside down
and beaten to a pulp

815
01:04:55,191 --> 01:04:57,489
than have to talk to you.

816
01:04:57,593 --> 01:04:59,857
Madison.

817
01:05:01,030 --> 01:05:02,861
You are Grace...

818
01:05:03,032 --> 01:05:05,296
and you are Margaret...

819
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:07,528
and you are Alexis.

820
01:05:07,703 --> 01:05:10,194
They're all you.

821
01:05:13,542 --> 01:05:16,511
No, because I didn't --

822
01:05:16,612 --> 01:05:18,512
I didn't say these things.

823
01:05:18,614 --> 01:05:20,548
Um...

824
01:05:21,284 --> 01:05:22,342
And I know that they're real,

825
01:05:22,451 --> 01:05:24,112
because I've --
I've talked to them and --

826
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:26,620
and I've talked to you about them.

827
01:05:28,157 --> 01:05:32,719
And... you've talked to them...

828
01:05:32,828 --> 01:05:34,295
Right?

829
01:05:35,331 --> 01:05:38,459
I've only talked to you.

830
01:05:45,308 --> 01:05:47,640
I've only talked to you.

831
01:05:52,748 --> 01:05:54,807
I don't know what's going on.

832
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:03,619
Where are you going?

833
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:06,421
Can you take me with you?

834
01:06:06,529 --> 01:06:08,224
Nope.

835
01:06:08,331 --> 01:06:09,161
Why?

836
01:06:09,332 --> 01:06:11,459
Because you...

837
01:06:12,435 --> 01:06:13,766
Are gonna stay here.

838
01:06:13,936 --> 01:06:15,733
But I want to be with you.

839
01:06:16,305 --> 01:06:19,103
Well, you know, that's too bad,
because you're not coming.

840
01:06:19,241 --> 01:06:20,503
But I want to stay with you.

841
01:06:20,609 --> 01:06:22,042
Alexis, don't cry.

842
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:23,441
Please, please don't cry.

843
01:06:23,546 --> 01:06:25,104
But -- but why can't I come?

844
01:06:25,281 --> 01:06:25,940
Why?

845
01:06:26,048 --> 01:06:27,515
-Because I said so.
-But why?

846
01:06:27,616 --> 01:06:29,049
Shh!

847
01:06:29,151 --> 01:06:30,243
Why?

848
01:06:30,353 --> 01:06:32,821
Because you're not real.

849
01:09:25,694 --> 01:09:28,527
If you're watching this right now...

850
01:09:29,798 --> 01:09:31,823
it's because you've forgotten

851
01:09:31,934 --> 01:09:34,698
why you've locked yourself
in your apartment.

852
01:09:35,971 --> 01:09:38,906
You've given yourself 30 days

853
01:09:39,008 --> 01:09:43,206
to figure out
why you're so messed up.

854
01:09:46,448 --> 01:09:48,541
Your phone's been turned off.

855
01:09:51,053 --> 01:09:52,384
You don't have shit.

856
01:09:52,488 --> 01:09:55,480
You don't have friends.
You don't have a job.

857
01:09:58,194 --> 01:10:00,719
This is your last chance.

858
01:10:01,797 --> 01:10:04,129
'Cause I swear to God,

859
01:10:04,233 --> 01:10:09,000
if things don't change
in these next 30 days...

860
01:10:10,339 --> 01:10:12,830
I will kill myself.

861
01:10:23,252 --> 01:10:24,412
Hello?

862
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:26,545
Dr. Barnes?

863
01:10:26,655 --> 01:10:27,883
Yes?

864
01:10:27,990 --> 01:10:31,153
Madison is gonna die tonight.

865
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:33,160
Who is this?

866
01:10:33,262 --> 01:10:35,230
Her friend.

867
01:10:35,331 --> 01:10:37,094
Where's Madison?

868
01:12:21,036 --> 01:12:23,163
Mama?!

869
01:12:24,773 --> 01:12:26,900
Mama?!

870
01:12:32,781 --> 01:12:34,840
Mama!

871
01:13:23,632 --> 01:13:26,362
Are you Mr. Walker?

872
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:29,728
Yeah.

873
01:13:29,905 --> 01:13:32,567
I'm a friend of Madison's.

874
01:13:33,776 --> 01:13:36,108
Please come inside.

875
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:50,991
She ain't no doctor.

876
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:54,152
Can't you see she's got
the devil all over her?

877
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:56,823
She's got him coming out
of her mouth, Steven.

878
01:13:56,999 --> 01:13:59,729
Look at how she's looking at me.

879
01:14:01,336 --> 01:14:03,304
The Lord gives me His eyes,

880
01:14:03,472 --> 01:14:05,667
and I see through
your wicked games.

881
01:14:05,841 --> 01:14:06,705
Dolly...

882
01:14:06,809 --> 01:14:09,403
Dolly, go on to your room.
Let me talk to her.

883
01:14:09,578 --> 01:14:11,409
I'll take care of it.

884
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:13,571
I pray for your soul.

885
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:18,746
I'm sorry about that.

886
01:14:18,921 --> 01:14:21,549
Some days are worse than others.

887
01:14:21,657 --> 01:14:23,750
Are you sure you don't want
anything to eat?

888
01:14:23,926 --> 01:14:25,518
I'm not hungry.

889
01:14:25,694 --> 01:14:27,525
Well, why don't you have a seat?

890
01:14:28,430 --> 01:14:29,795
Now...

891
01:14:29,898 --> 01:14:33,299
What was it that you were saying
about Madison?

892
01:14:34,169 --> 01:14:37,138
Madison checked herself
out of the hospital,

893
01:14:37,239 --> 01:14:40,504
and, um, I'm really worried
that she might hurt herself.

894
01:14:41,610 --> 01:14:43,271
Do you know where she is?

895
01:14:43,378 --> 01:14:46,279
No, but, uh, you -- you --

896
01:14:46,381 --> 01:14:49,009
I think that you should
just stay right here until --

897
01:14:49,117 --> 01:14:50,948
Until she comes around.

898
01:15:00,262 --> 01:15:03,459
Do you mind if I ask you
a-a few questions?

899
01:15:03,632 --> 01:15:06,123
Please, yes, do.

900
01:15:06,435 --> 01:15:11,270
Did you know what was going on...

901
01:15:11,373 --> 01:15:14,206
between Madison and her mother

902
01:15:14,309 --> 01:15:17,073
when Madison was young?

903
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:19,845
Well, now...

904
01:15:19,948 --> 01:15:22,246
I don't know what you, uh --

905
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:24,581
I don't know what you mean --
what you mean.

906
01:15:24,686 --> 01:15:28,747
Did you travel a lot
when she was young?

907
01:15:30,092 --> 01:15:31,753
Yeah, I did, I did.

908
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:33,452
Quite a bit.

909
01:15:33,562 --> 01:15:36,793
And you weren't curious...

910
01:15:36,899 --> 01:15:40,892
about all the trips to the hospital...

911
01:15:41,970 --> 01:15:44,029
while you were gone?

912
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:46,002
Um...

913
01:15:47,676 --> 01:15:50,201
Hospital -- hospital trips.

914
01:15:50,312 --> 01:15:51,438
That's, um...

915
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:54,608
Well, if you're gonna pretend
that you don't know what happened,

916
01:15:54,716 --> 01:15:57,014
then it's not gonna help her.

917
01:15:57,586 --> 01:16:01,488
And I think that you should... tell her.

918
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,755
What should I say?

919
01:16:10,966 --> 01:16:13,298
That you're sorry.

920
01:16:39,561 --> 01:16:41,461
Can we read that part again?

921
01:16:41,563 --> 01:16:42,655
Which part?

922
01:16:42,764 --> 01:16:44,288
The part about being real.

923
01:16:44,466 --> 01:16:47,230
"What is real?", asked the rabbit.

924
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:51,597
"Real isn't how you're made,"
said the skin horse.

925
01:16:51,707 --> 01:16:54,301
"It's a thing that happens to you."

926
01:16:54,776 --> 01:16:57,006
-My turn?
-Go ahead.

927
01:16:57,112 --> 01:16:58,272
"Does it hurt?"

928
01:16:58,380 --> 01:16:59,745
"Sometimes.

929
01:16:59,848 --> 01:17:02,646
When you are real,
you don't mind being hurt."

930
01:17:06,521 --> 01:17:08,955
I love my daughter.

931
01:17:10,225 --> 01:17:12,090
I love her very much.

932
01:17:24,439 --> 01:17:26,168
I know.

933
01:17:35,050 --> 01:17:38,383
It's not worth playing
into her games like that.

934
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:39,886
What about it?

935
01:17:39,988 --> 01:17:41,979
I have enabled her.

936
01:17:43,091 --> 01:17:46,254
We know better.
We know better, Steven.

937
01:17:46,361 --> 01:17:48,522
I just -- it's just --
it's so hard for me, okay?

938
01:17:48,630 --> 01:17:51,064
This is a dangerous situation, Steven.

939
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:54,368
I can't talk about it
anymore, darling.

940
01:17:54,536 --> 01:17:56,470
I just can't talk about it anymore.

941
01:18:07,582 --> 01:18:13,578
I-I know how difficult
this has been for all of us.

942
01:18:16,058 --> 01:18:19,050
And your daughter is -- is...

943
01:18:20,328 --> 01:18:22,694
is, uh...

944
01:18:24,066 --> 01:18:26,091
is...

945
01:18:26,268 --> 01:18:28,862
Sweetheart, sweetheart...

946
01:18:29,971 --> 01:18:32,235
You...

947
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:33,967
are...

948
01:18:34,076 --> 01:18:36,067
our daughter.

949
01:18:37,946 --> 01:18:39,311
I'm...

950
01:18:39,414 --> 01:18:40,506
You understand?

951
01:18:40,615 --> 01:18:42,446
-No.
-You understand?

952
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:43,916
You are.

953
01:18:44,019 --> 01:18:46,249
You are.

954
01:18:52,761 --> 01:18:54,956
Oh.

955
01:19:14,850 --> 01:19:18,581
It's a little hard
for us to understand...

956
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:20,346
but...

957
01:19:21,523 --> 01:19:25,084
Maddie, we'd like to help you
if we can.

958
01:19:29,464 --> 01:19:31,056
Madison?

959
01:19:31,166 --> 01:19:33,031
Yeah?

960
01:19:33,135 --> 01:19:35,695
Hey. Hey.

961
01:19:37,873 --> 01:19:40,034
Hey.

962
01:19:59,761 --> 01:20:01,922
You should have told me.

963
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:07,796
I should have told you what?

964
01:20:07,903 --> 01:20:10,303
That you weren't real.

965
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:15,173
I'm as real as you are.

966
01:20:17,479 --> 01:20:19,674
And the others?

967
01:20:19,781 --> 01:20:21,271
They real?

968
01:20:21,383 --> 01:20:23,374
I don't care about the others.

969
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:25,713
I've only cared about you.

970
01:20:35,697 --> 01:20:37,722
So, what happens now?

971
01:20:38,967 --> 01:20:41,629
We say good-bye.

972
01:20:45,674 --> 01:20:48,199
No. No good-byes, no good-byes.

973
01:20:48,376 --> 01:20:50,037
Yeah.

974
01:20:52,047 --> 01:20:53,241
It's time.

975
01:21:01,923 --> 01:21:04,551
You're gonna be okay on your own.

976
01:21:08,830 --> 01:21:10,730
You will.

977
01:21:10,832 --> 01:21:12,823
You will.

978
01:23:03,645 --> 01:23:05,772
* Wipe those tears *

979
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:08,781
* Away from your eyes *

980
01:23:08,883 --> 01:23:10,817
* Just take my hand *

981
01:23:10,919 --> 01:23:12,910
* You don't have to cry *

982
01:23:13,021 --> 01:23:15,854
* It'll be all right *

983
01:23:15,957 --> 01:23:17,686
* Baby *

984
01:23:17,792 --> 01:23:21,387
* I'll make it all right *

985
01:23:24,132 --> 01:23:26,657
* Don't let the world *

986
01:23:26,768 --> 01:23:29,134
* Get you down *

987
01:23:29,237 --> 01:23:33,333
* Reach for the love
that's all around *

988
01:23:33,441 --> 01:23:36,274
* It'll be all right *

989
01:23:36,378 --> 01:23:38,141
* Baby *

990
01:23:38,246 --> 01:23:41,613
* We'll make it all right *

991
01:23:44,452 --> 01:23:49,617
* I'll pick you up
when you're feeling down *

992
01:23:49,724 --> 01:23:54,752
* I'll put your feet
back on solid ground *

993
01:23:54,863 --> 01:23:59,891
* I'll pick you up,
and I'll make you strong *

994
01:24:00,001 --> 01:24:03,835
* I'll make you feel
like you still belong *

995
01:24:03,938 --> 01:24:07,271
* 'Cause it's all right *

996
01:24:08,410 --> 01:24:12,437
* Let me make it all right *

997
01:24:13,848 --> 01:24:17,682
* Stay with me tonight *

998
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:22,856
* Stay with me tonight *

999
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:30,657
* Sometimes the words,
well, they're just not enough *

1000
01:24:30,765 --> 01:24:34,326
* Afraid of feeling
and in need of love *

1001
01:24:34,436 --> 01:24:37,496
* To make it all right *

1002
01:24:37,605 --> 01:24:39,470
* Baby *

1003
01:24:39,574 --> 01:24:43,032
* I'll make it all right *

1004
01:24:45,780 --> 01:24:50,740
* Where will you run to,
and where will you hide? *

1005
01:24:50,919 --> 01:24:54,582
* I know the pain comes
from deep down inside *

1006
01:24:54,789 --> 01:24:57,986
* But it'll be all right *

1007
01:24:58,093 --> 01:24:59,958
* Baby *

1008
01:25:00,061 --> 01:25:02,757
* I'll make it all right *

1009
01:25:04,299 --> 01:25:07,462
* Let me make it all right *

1010
01:25:07,569 --> 01:25:09,696
* Make it all right *

1011
01:25:09,804 --> 01:25:12,637
* Let me make it all right *

1012
01:25:12,740 --> 01:25:15,174
* Make it all right *

1013
01:25:15,276 --> 01:25:18,609
* Stay with me tonight *

1014
01:25:19,914 --> 01:25:23,372
* Stay with me tonight *

1015
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:27,988
* It's all right *

1016
01:25:28,089 --> 01:25:30,557
* Yeah, it's all right *

1017
01:25:30,658 --> 01:25:33,058
* It's all right *

1018
01:25:33,161 --> 01:25:35,789
* Yeah, it's all right *

1019
01:25:35,897 --> 01:25:39,162
* It's all right *

1020
01:25:40,034 --> 01:25:43,526
* Stay with me tonight *

1021
01:25:47,208 --> 01:25:52,145
* I'll pick you up
when you're feeling down *

1022
01:25:52,247 --> 01:25:57,344
* I'll put your feet back
on solid ground *

1023
01:25:57,452 --> 01:26:02,219
* I'll pick you up,
and I'll make you strong *

1024
01:26:02,323 --> 01:26:07,590
* Make you feel
like you still belong *

1025
01:26:08,997 --> 01:26:11,431
* And it's all right *

1026
01:26:11,533 --> 01:26:13,558
* Yeah, it's all right *

1027
01:26:13,668 --> 01:26:16,535
* Let me make it all right *

1028
01:26:16,638 --> 01:26:18,970
* Make it all right *

1029
01:26:19,073 --> 01:26:22,839
* Stay with me tonight *

1030
01:26:24,212 --> 01:26:27,943
* Stay with me tonight *

1031
01:26:30,752 --> 01:26:33,050
* Don't let the world *

1032
01:26:33,154 --> 01:26:35,554
* Get you down *

1033
01:26:35,657 --> 01:26:39,457
* Reach for the love
that's all around *

1034
01:26:39,561 --> 01:26:42,655
* It's gonna be all right *

1035
01:26:42,764 --> 01:26:44,595
* Baby *

1036
01:26:44,699 --> 01:26:47,668
* It's gonna be all right *

1037
01:26:51,072 --> 01:26:52,937
* Wipe those tears *

1038
01:26:53,041 --> 01:26:56,067
* Away from your eyes *

1039
01:26:56,177 --> 01:26:58,042
* Just take my hand *

1040
01:26:58,146 --> 01:27:00,512
* You don't have to cry *

1041
01:27:01,916 --> 01:27:05,113
* It's all right *

1042
01:27:10,225 --> 01:27:12,693
* It's all right *

1043
01:27:12,794 --> 01:27:15,285
* Yeah, it's all right *

1044
01:27:15,396 --> 01:27:17,762
* It's all right *

1045
01:27:17,865 --> 01:27:20,766
* Yeah, it's all right *

1046
01:27:25,006 --> 01:27:28,339
* Gonna make it all right *

1047
01:27:36,017 --> 01:27:38,747
* Mm-mm *

1048
01:27:40,021 --> 01:27:44,549
* Stay with me tonight *
