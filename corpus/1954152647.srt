1
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:40,081
- Hello?
- Tracey, it's Bradley.

2
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:42,292
Bradley,
where the hell are you guys?

3
00:00:42,293 --> 00:00:45,088
- I am freaking out!
- Listen.

4
00:00:45,505 --> 00:00:47,129
We fucked up.

5
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,173
What are you talking about?

6
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:53,137
Me and Doug are about to get married and
I haven't heard from him in two days.

7
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,558
Things got a little out of control
last night and we...

8
00:00:57,308 --> 00:00:58,933
We lost Doug.

9
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:00,811
The wedding is in a few hours!

10
00:01:00,812 --> 00:01:03,147
- In Santa Barbara?
- Yeah!

11
00:01:04,607 --> 00:01:07,068
That's not gonna happen.

12
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:56,324
Look, I know everyone's a little miffed
we couldn't do Vegas this year,

13
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:59,411
but I'm telling you, Chief Loose
Slots is the next best thing.

14
00:01:59,412 --> 00:02:01,663
I don't care where we have
my bachelor party, guys.

15
00:02:01,664 --> 00:02:04,417
All that matters
is that we're celebrating together.

16
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,669
And that we don't have AIDS.

17
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:11,174
Anyway, I bet once you get inside,
it's not so bad.

18
00:02:20,058 --> 00:02:21,643
All right!

19
00:02:25,563 --> 00:02:27,315
Hey, it's cute.

20
00:02:30,777 --> 00:02:33,988
I am honestly impressed
by how shitty this is.

21
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,741
You don't even need a blacklight
to see all the stains.

22
00:02:36,866 --> 00:02:38,784
Maybe that's yogurt.

23
00:02:38,785 --> 00:02:42,413
Nah, it says right here in
the pamphlet, it is semen.

24
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:45,624
Look, semen or no semen,

25
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:47,961
the important thing is that Doug

26
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:49,378
found his soulmate.

27
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:50,587
Thanks, man.

28
00:02:50,588 --> 00:02:52,465
Tracey just completes
in me, you know?

29
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,551
Did you say, "Completes in you"?

30
00:02:55,301 --> 00:02:59,303
You know, that reminds of the love shared
between Peeta and Katniss in The...

31
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,598
I'm gonna need you to stop talking
about that book.

32
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,726
No, I will not stop
talking about a novel

33
00:03:04,727 --> 00:03:09,815
that blogcritics.org/reviews said
was "a page-turner."

34
00:03:09,816 --> 00:03:11,567
Have you even read it?

35
00:03:11,568 --> 00:03:15,530
I'd love to, man. It's just hard to find time
to enrol in 7th grade and cut off my nuts.

36
00:03:16,322 --> 00:03:20,826
Well then, maybe I'll find it hard
to find time to share my goodies.

37
00:03:20,827 --> 00:03:23,411
Oh, nice. What do you got in there?

38
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:25,414
I've got all kinds of fun stuff.

39
00:03:25,415 --> 00:03:28,751
I have Chernobyl potato vodka,

40
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:31,462
standard-issue roofies,

41
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,883
I've got Chinese black tar heroin,

42
00:03:35,425 --> 00:03:38,636
I've got drug mule
rectum-release opium,

43
00:03:39,554 --> 00:03:42,514
and some plug-in air fresheners.

44
00:03:42,515 --> 00:03:43,933
How did that get in here?

45
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:46,393
All right. You got any bath salts?

46
00:03:46,394 --> 00:03:47,603
Tons. Help yourself.

47
00:03:47,604 --> 00:03:50,396
I've also got skunk,
skoof, skat, flippers,

48
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:53,357
flappers, floppers, uppers, downers,

49
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,401
and cyanide chewables.

50
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:57,738
Cyanide? Poison is the best.

51
00:03:57,739 --> 00:04:00,364
Hey! Those are my fun-time candies!

52
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:01,617
No.

53
00:04:01,618 --> 00:04:04,912
Every time we go out, we end up
blacked out and looking for somebody.

54
00:04:04,913 --> 00:04:08,499
Vegas. Thailand.
My nephew Ruben's Bar Mitzvah.

55
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:10,584
Whatever, we got him back
in time for the service.

56
00:04:10,585 --> 00:04:13,213
Yeah, and then he puked
all over the Torah.

57
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:16,633
- Classic.
- No, not classic. That is a holy document.

58
00:04:18,176 --> 00:04:21,471
All right, let's just get Zach
dressed and head to the roof.

59
00:04:21,763 --> 00:04:23,181
Dressed?

60
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,069
Small request, you guys.
Could somebody scratch my nuts?

61
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,323
I respectfully decline.

62
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:44,284
- Non-alcoholic beer?
- I told you. No risks tonight.

63
00:04:44,285 --> 00:04:45,703
Pussy!

64
00:04:46,788 --> 00:04:49,999
Excuse me,
I was calling you a pussy.

65
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,292
All right.

66
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,085
Let's put our shitty rehab beers up

67
00:04:53,086 --> 00:04:55,338
and toast Doug and Tracey.

68
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:59,173
I never thought your soulmate would
have an Adam's apple and a penis,

69
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:01,801
but, hey, life's a journey, I guess.

70
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:03,179
We're happy for you, man.

71
00:05:03,847 --> 00:05:05,429
Thanks, guys.

72
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,014
To Doug and Tracey.

73
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:09,686
- To Doug and Tracey.
- And

74
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,856
to a night we'll never forget.

75
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,445
Those look really good.

76
00:05:19,821 --> 00:05:22,407
Could you just pour it in my cone?

77
00:06:10,205 --> 00:06:12,248
What the fuck?

78
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,292
Oh, God.

79
00:06:22,717 --> 00:06:24,052
What?

80
00:06:25,887 --> 00:06:28,640
Scuba guy on the ceiling.
That makes sense.

81
00:06:30,058 --> 00:06:31,434
Jesus!

82
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:34,562
- You stepped on my balls, dude.
- Sorry.

83
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:37,190
Where the hell are we?

84
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,318
Fuck if I know.

85
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:44,948
All I know is
I am hungover as shit right now.

86
00:06:45,323 --> 00:06:47,575
I think I'm legally dead.

87
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:50,411
And my mouth tastes assy.

88
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:52,372
Please tell me I ate cheese.

89
00:06:53,456 --> 00:06:56,167
I don't know. My ass kind of hurts.

90
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,461
Oh, no! Did I do cocaine?

91
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:01,506
I'm deathly allergic to cocaine.

92
00:07:01,923 --> 00:07:04,092
And I'm allergic to gluten.

93
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:06,760
I hope that's gluten-free.

94
00:07:06,761 --> 00:07:08,012
Oh, no.

95
00:07:08,137 --> 00:07:10,390
Did we kill Waldo last night?

96
00:07:13,268 --> 00:07:15,061
Maybe he was fucked to death.

97
00:07:17,564 --> 00:07:19,232
Morning, fellas!

98
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:22,276
God damn it,
who let Zach out of the straitjacket?

99
00:07:22,277 --> 00:07:24,820
Is that a man-thong?

100
00:07:24,821 --> 00:07:27,615
No, it's a regular thong.
I wear them all the time.

101
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:29,116
That's disgusting.

102
00:07:29,117 --> 00:07:31,867
Okay, we need to find Doug
and get the hell out of here.

103
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,287
Somebody call him.
Where's my phone?

104
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:37,834
Oh, holy shit. Is this
a rocket launcher?

105
00:07:38,293 --> 00:07:39,544
Zach?

106
00:07:40,128 --> 00:07:42,796
- Dude!
- Come on, we have to find Doug.

107
00:07:42,797 --> 00:07:44,382
But that was...

108
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:49,846
Oh, my. Gentlemen,
this is quite a mess.

109
00:07:50,471 --> 00:07:55,101
Okay, this is awkward,
but I'm just gonna go ahead and ask,

110
00:07:55,226 --> 00:07:56,976
maid or hooker?

111
00:07:56,977 --> 00:08:00,982
Manners! That is no way to speak
to your escort.

112
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:04,110
I always ask.
The answer's always the same.

113
00:08:05,028 --> 00:08:09,032
It's been real nice talking to you,
but we're just gonna go.

114
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:13,536
- I wouldn't do that.
- Okay.

115
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:21,878
We're on a fucking train?

116
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:23,837
I knew it!

117
00:08:23,838 --> 00:08:26,006
That means you're Effie Trinket!

118
00:08:26,007 --> 00:08:27,715
No, my name is Effing.

119
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:30,927
And the three of you
are on your way to the Games.

120
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:33,389
We discussed this
all after your courageous gesture.

121
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,726
Why don't you look at your phone?

122
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:42,398
Fucking Reaping, bitches!

123
00:08:46,528 --> 00:08:48,862
Doug's trying to kiss me again!

124
00:08:48,863 --> 00:08:50,364
Doug, how you doing, buddy?

125
00:08:50,365 --> 00:08:52,992
Fucking Reaping, bitches!

126
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:56,203
The first name of the girl...

127
00:08:56,204 --> 00:08:59,163
- Why is Lady Gaga on the screen?
- ...of the Games goes to...

128
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:00,791
Change the channel!

129
00:09:00,792 --> 00:09:02,544
young Boo!

130
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:04,877
And now for the boys.

131
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,798
I volunteer!

132
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:11,425
We volunteer for the Hungover Games!

133
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:13,763
What a wonderful development!

134
00:09:14,222 --> 00:09:18,059
Three of our brave volunteers
to add to the race.

135
00:09:18,393 --> 00:09:21,395
May the chances be
ever in your corner.

136
00:09:21,396 --> 00:09:24,606
Attica! Attica!

137
00:09:24,607 --> 00:09:26,274
Okay, okay.

138
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:27,652
Hey!

139
00:09:29,362 --> 00:09:30,487
Okay.

140
00:09:30,488 --> 00:09:32,991
Will you keep it down?

141
00:09:33,282 --> 00:09:35,743
I can hardly hear myself drink.

142
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:37,537
Haymitch!

143
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:41,499
That's not my name, you
scruffy half-tard.

144
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,459
It's Justmitch.

145
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:47,963
Look, I'm enjoying all of this.

146
00:09:47,964 --> 00:09:49,381
I really am.

147
00:09:49,382 --> 00:09:53,969
Especially that little blonde schoolgirl
situation you've got going on right there.

148
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:58,433
But right now we really just need to
find our friend and be on our way.

149
00:10:00,768 --> 00:10:04,772
The Sponsors will eat that
bromance shit up with a spoon.

150
00:10:04,898 --> 00:10:06,691
Speaking of which.

151
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:10,653
Okay, let me guess, now you're gonna
tell us how to win the Games?

152
00:10:12,447 --> 00:10:16,324
If you wanna live long enough
to find your pansy little friend,

153
00:10:16,325 --> 00:10:18,411
you'd best learn to listen to me.

154
00:10:20,455 --> 00:10:23,499
If there's two things I
know, it's hangovers

155
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,919
and murdering for sport.

156
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:29,171
And, hey, if you're lucky enough,

157
00:10:29,172 --> 00:10:32,550
one of y'all might get
out of here alive.

158
00:10:33,426 --> 00:10:35,843
Did you just say "one" of us?

159
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:39,641
Now if you'll excuse me,
I gotta find a vein.

160
00:10:46,856 --> 00:10:49,400
You're watching Capitol Sports.

161
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:53,319
Skip, it's my favourite
time of the year.

162
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:57,032
The weather is warming,
the tig ol' bitties is coming out

163
00:10:57,033 --> 00:11:00,452
and right now,
it's time for the Hungover Games!

164
00:11:00,453 --> 00:11:02,203
A great competition
shaping up this year.

165
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:04,706
Contestants from the
Superheroes District

166
00:11:04,707 --> 00:11:07,959
and the Middle Earth District
are once again among the favourites.

167
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:11,295
The Puppet District and the Depp
District are particularly intriguing to

168
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:12,924
Stephen A. Timplesmith.

169
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,383
Johnny Depp. Is there any
weirdo this guy won't play?

170
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:16,509
Straight freak!

171
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:19,721
Next up, we have
The Real Housewives of District 8.

172
00:11:19,722 --> 00:11:22,640
Now these trashy bitches

173
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:25,727
have about a OO_ chance of surviving
the Games.

174
00:11:25,728 --> 00:11:27,895
White girls! Got me one at home.

175
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:30,608
Next up, we've got
the Django District.

176
00:11:31,317 --> 00:11:34,402
Now Django is tough,
but let's get this straight, Skip.

177
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:37,740
He will never be LeBron.

178
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:39,116
Now, on the Django team

179
00:11:39,117 --> 00:11:42,743
we have famed plantation owner
Calvin Dandy.

180
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:45,123
Ironically, he's a
good friend of mine.

181
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:49,250
All right, next up we have
the Gratuitous Nudity District.

182
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:50,962
Dizzamn!

183
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:54,298
Everybody knows you cannot make
entertainment like this

184
00:11:54,299 --> 00:11:57,759
without some inexplicable,
unwarranted nudity.

185
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,262
And finally our field is rounded out
by our outlying districts.

186
00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:03,641
District 9, Avatar.

187
00:12:03,766 --> 00:12:05,977
District 10, Horror.

188
00:12:06,435 --> 00:12:09,146
District 11, Katnip Everlean.

189
00:12:09,147 --> 00:12:11,647
District 12, The Hungover Guys.

190
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:14,319
Hey! That looks like us and Doug!

191
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:18,946
Look, we've got about
48 hours to find him

192
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:21,032
and get him back to that wedding.

193
00:12:21,033 --> 00:12:22,493
Okay.

194
00:12:22,618 --> 00:12:25,163
I guess it's time for us
to kill some motherfuckers.

195
00:12:39,135 --> 00:12:41,304
I have the power!

196
00:12:41,304 --> 00:12:42,555
Come on, cunt.

197
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,725
Oh, foo. Another year, another murder.

198
00:12:45,725 --> 00:12:49,354
What a crop of freakazoids.

199
00:12:52,148 --> 00:12:53,481
Stop swinging that in my face.

200
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:55,150
That is dangerous. That is not a toy!

201
00:12:55,151 --> 00:12:57,319
Zach, will you stop?
You're making us look like idiots.

202
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,406
No, Mr I Can't Even
Pick Up This Boulder.

203
00:13:06,329 --> 00:13:08,789
You're making us look bad
in front of the Sponsors.

204
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:10,706
Why are they all dressed like that?

205
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:13,545
Looks like a Lady
Gaga family reunion.

206
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:16,089
Look, you see that?

207
00:13:16,381 --> 00:13:18,422
Our odds are pretty shitty right now.

208
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:20,969
Hey, why do the puppets
have better odds than us?

209
00:13:28,351 --> 00:13:30,061
Cross-checking...

210
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:36,067
Excuse me. Sorry, I hate to bother you
with this, but my friend is stuck.

211
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:44,490
World War Z, right?

212
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,327
No. Walking Dead, actually.

213
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,436
Oh, right, right. You were
the one that bit that

214
00:13:48,437 --> 00:13:50,441
guy's ear and then ate
his face off, right?

215
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:51,916
Guilty.

216
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:55,211
So who else came from your district?

217
00:13:55,378 --> 00:13:58,798
Just that crazy
blood-covered bitch over there.

218
00:13:59,132 --> 00:14:01,216
She scares the shit out of me.

219
00:14:01,217 --> 00:14:02,719
I can see why.

220
00:14:06,806 --> 00:14:11,269
Wow. Kaptain Kazakhstan
is really rocking that burlap sack.

221
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:14,061
Look at the size of
those Oompa Loompas.

222
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:15,439
You're welcome.

223
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,107
That's quite a bit of shrubbery
he has down there.

224
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:20,778
Can you say, "Ch-Ch-Ch-Chia"?

225
00:14:32,248 --> 00:14:33,499
Listen.

226
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:35,877
They're looking at you
like you're a meal.

227
00:14:36,169 --> 00:14:39,422
Especially that flamboyant
Scandinavian guy.

228
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:43,718
He wants to roll you in sugar
like a dick churro.

229
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,053
So what am I supposed to do?

230
00:14:46,054 --> 00:14:48,681
They need to know
that you can take a punch.

231
00:14:49,057 --> 00:14:50,350
What?

232
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:52,519
Yeah. Trust me.

233
00:14:57,524 --> 00:14:58,858
Okay.

234
00:15:03,488 --> 00:15:05,154
Okay, I'm good.

235
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:06,658
All right, I'm good.

236
00:15:08,326 --> 00:15:11,285
The elbow didn't count.
Come on, come on.

237
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:14,082
Now, just remember,
this hurts you more than it hurts me.

238
00:15:17,501 --> 00:15:18,752
Why, dude? Why?

239
00:15:18,753 --> 00:15:21,673
I don't know.
I forgot why we're even doing this.

240
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:26,301
I'm pooped.

241
00:15:26,302 --> 00:15:28,638
I want a vitamin water or something.

242
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:30,431
Not bad.

243
00:15:31,808 --> 00:15:33,517
That means I need a vitamin water!

244
00:15:33,518 --> 00:15:36,354
Okay, okay, I'll get it!
I'll get a vitamin water for you!

245
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,068
Not again.

246
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:55,874
My right nut is numb.

247
00:15:56,248 --> 00:15:58,168
I can take a hit, Zach.

248
00:15:59,335 --> 00:16:00,878
I can give one, too.

249
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:02,546
You ready for the thunder?

250
00:16:02,547 --> 00:16:04,215
Well, here's the lightning!

251
00:16:04,257 --> 00:16:06,257
Oh, son of a hooker, that hurt!

252
00:16:06,258 --> 00:16:06,860
Hey, watch it!

253
00:16:06,861 --> 00:16:09,010
Sorry, I didn't see anything,
I swear to God!

254
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:10,805
- My elbow may have grazed...
- Ed.

255
00:16:12,264 --> 00:16:13,725
Hey...

256
00:16:14,267 --> 00:16:15,518
Okay.

257
00:16:17,687 --> 00:16:19,606
How are you?

258
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:21,566
- Hey...
- Hi.

259
00:16:21,566 --> 00:16:22,859
you.

260
00:16:25,236 --> 00:16:26,738
You don't remember me.

261
00:16:27,488 --> 00:16:28,906
It's Katnip.

262
00:16:28,907 --> 00:16:30,783
Katnip Everlean.

263
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:34,577
I'm sorry.
It's just that last night, we...

264
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:36,789
- You were wasted.
- Yeah.

265
00:16:37,248 --> 00:16:39,540
You guys bought us drinks
after the Reaping.

266
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:43,213
You said you were going
district-hopping, and you up and left.

267
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:46,674
Jeez! You guys clearly have
a drinking problem!

268
00:16:46,924 --> 00:16:49,468
Is that a talking bird?

269
00:16:49,469 --> 00:16:52,221
I'm a talking jay, you birdbrain.

270
00:16:52,222 --> 00:16:53,971
For a nerd, you're pretty dumb.

271
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:56,599
Sorry. He's really nice
once you get to know him.

272
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,602
Yeah, just ask your mom.

273
00:16:58,603 --> 00:17:00,020
That's rude.

274
00:17:00,021 --> 00:17:02,690
Go away. How are you
feeling, by the way?

275
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:05,608
Well, besides the raging hangover,

276
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:07,777
the free-for-all death
match coming up,

277
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:11,074
and the shit taste I can't
get out of my mouth,

278
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:14,158
I'm actually doing great.

279
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:16,621
Hey, look, it's Dumb and Dumberer.

280
00:17:16,996 --> 00:17:19,372
A talking jay.

281
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:21,626
So elegant.

282
00:17:25,713 --> 00:17:27,923
Hey, get your mitts off me!

283
00:17:27,924 --> 00:17:30,677
Where'd you go to school, Penn State?

284
00:17:33,137 --> 00:17:34,680
Wow, okay, yeah.

285
00:17:34,681 --> 00:17:37,139
I'm not even gonna
try to process that right now.

286
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,768
Excuse me?

287
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:42,311
- It's Katnip, Bradley. We met last night.
- Yeah, Bradley.

288
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:45,274
Yeah, right, okay. About last night,

289
00:17:45,275 --> 00:17:49,028
do you have any idea what happened
to our friend Doug?

290
00:17:49,863 --> 00:17:53,741
No. But I did wake up today
and I saw you all volunteered.

291
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:56,158
That was really brave of you.

292
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:57,785
That is one word for it.

293
00:17:57,786 --> 00:17:59,955
No, seriously. You guys were
talking about it so much

294
00:17:59,956 --> 00:18:01,414
you inspired me to do it.

295
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:04,252
That's why I took my
little sister's place.

296
00:18:04,878 --> 00:18:07,213
That was stupid. Sorry.

297
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:09,757
You have a little sister?

298
00:18:09,924 --> 00:18:13,720
Is she into husky bearded guys
with low-level personality disorders?

299
00:18:15,889 --> 00:18:18,347
- Nice!
- I like this girl.

300
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:20,685
That got more hand than apple.

301
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:25,938
Attention, battlers,
battlers, battlers.

302
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:29,233
The training centre is now closed.

303
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:31,570
It is time to die.

304
00:18:31,571 --> 00:18:33,406
Make that work.

305
00:18:33,656 --> 00:18:36,910
That's my catchphrase, you know.
"Make that work."

306
00:18:38,244 --> 00:18:40,413
Hello? A little help here?

307
00:18:42,665 --> 00:18:42,706
20, 19, 18,

308
00:18:42,707 --> 00:18:45,792
20, 19, 18,

309
00:18:45,793 --> 00:18:47,543
17,

310
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:49,088
16,

311
00:18:49,255 --> 00:18:50,671
15,

312
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:52,214
14...

313
00:18:52,216 --> 00:18:55,220
- Doug! Dougie!
- Doug man!

314
00:18:56,094 --> 00:18:57,804
Doug? Doug?

315
00:18:57,805 --> 00:18:59,265
Doug!

316
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:01,808
Doug? Where are you, man?

317
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:03,728
Where the fuck is he?

318
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:06,064
- Doug?
- Doug?

319
00:19:08,483 --> 00:19:10,235
Was that him?

320
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:14,654
Hey, sweetheart.

321
00:19:14,655 --> 00:19:17,908
Looking for a white guy,
yea high, generic, unfunny,

322
00:19:17,909 --> 00:19:21,120
really forgettable.
Was that him right now?

323
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,582
Come on, talk to me.

324
00:19:26,543 --> 00:19:28,293
She's a goddamn mute or something.

325
00:19:28,294 --> 00:19:29,671
Man, fuck you, white boy.

326
00:19:31,088 --> 00:19:32,548
What are you guys doing here?

327
00:19:32,549 --> 00:19:35,133
You need to get to
your tube room immediately.

328
00:19:35,134 --> 00:19:38,304
- Okay, you don't have to manhandle me!
- Oh, my tea!

329
00:19:39,514 --> 00:19:43,726
You just got bubble tea
all over my control panel.

330
00:19:43,935 --> 00:19:45,854
Get him out of here!

331
00:19:46,062 --> 00:19:47,355
16,

332
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:48,647
15,

333
00:19:48,648 --> 00:19:49,982
14,

334
00:19:49,983 --> 00:19:51,275
13,

335
00:19:51,276 --> 00:19:52,400
12...

336
00:19:52,401 --> 00:19:55,029
Jeez, guys. Portion control much?

337
00:19:55,655 --> 00:19:56,948
9,

338
00:19:57,282 --> 00:19:58,447
8,

339
00:19:58,448 --> 00:19:59,782
1,

340
00:19:59,783 --> 00:20:01,033
6,

341
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:02,287
5,

342
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:03,872
4,

343
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:05,164
3,

344
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:06,831
2,

345
00:20:06,832 --> 00:20:08,126
1.

346
00:20:13,173 --> 00:20:16,509
No, no, no! Don't step of
fthe platform, we'll explode!

347
00:20:17,135 --> 00:20:18,595
Oh, God.

348
00:20:18,678 --> 00:20:19,929
Oh, God.

349
00:20:27,144 --> 00:20:30,479
Now the contestants line up
before the Pornucopia,

350
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,983
no doubt picking out the weapons
they wanna grab.

351
00:20:32,984 --> 00:20:36,696
Doug, Doug, come on, man.
Where are you?

352
00:20:36,863 --> 00:20:38,863
He must be on the other side
of that tent full of...

353
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:41,534
What are those? Sex weapons?

354
00:20:41,576 --> 00:20:43,703
Where the fuck are we?

355
00:20:44,162 --> 00:20:48,081
This is a great time to mention
that the weaponry has been provided by

356
00:20:48,082 --> 00:20:51,419
Delta Venus, Queen of the Sex Toys.

357
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:06,643
Let the killing begin!

358
00:21:10,522 --> 00:21:13,358
Shit, come on! Maybe we can find him
before he gets slaughtered.

359
00:21:13,608 --> 00:21:15,902
I got this. Yeah.

360
00:21:16,944 --> 00:21:18,947
Fuck! My hammie!
I should've stretched!

361
00:21:19,072 --> 00:21:21,574
Oh, I should've stretched first!

362
00:21:27,664 --> 00:21:28,915
Yeah!

363
00:21:35,255 --> 00:21:37,215
White wine! I hate white wine!

364
00:21:50,227 --> 00:21:52,063
Okay, barrel roll!

365
00:21:52,188 --> 00:21:53,564
Shit, really? Are you all right?

366
00:21:53,565 --> 00:21:55,984
- At least tell me that looked awesome.
- Yeah. Sure.

367
00:21:59,403 --> 00:22:02,488
Oh, it's a red man. High five?

368
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:04,701
No? How about this?

369
00:22:05,243 --> 00:22:06,786
You like?

370
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:15,336
Put penis away, kemosabe.

371
00:22:48,619 --> 00:22:50,330
Is that labia?

372
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:58,002
- That is a bear!
- Wait, wait, wait, wait!

373
00:22:58,003 --> 00:23:00,464
Wait, wait! No, no, no!

374
00:23:00,465 --> 00:23:02,715
Doug must have come up right here!
Where is he?

375
00:23:02,716 --> 00:23:03,968
Fuck!

376
00:23:44,424 --> 00:23:45,969
Come back here!

377
00:23:46,051 --> 00:23:48,221
Fuck! And where's Zach?

378
00:23:49,222 --> 00:23:51,641
Well, hey there, boy.

379
00:23:55,019 --> 00:23:57,230
Goddamn women!

380
00:23:58,021 --> 00:23:59,563
Don't mind if I do.

381
00:23:59,565 --> 00:24:03,276
Now, now, don't do nothing
foolish there, N-word.

382
00:24:03,277 --> 00:24:05,738
I like the way you die, boy.

383
00:24:10,492 --> 00:24:12,078
Django's free!

384
00:24:14,038 --> 00:24:15,872
- Take that, black!
- Dude!

385
00:24:15,874 --> 00:24:18,293
You like baseball, Jackie Robinson?

386
00:24:20,377 --> 00:24:21,796
- Shit!
- Oh, that's cruel!

387
00:24:21,962 --> 00:24:24,299
Hey, you thirsty? Here's some tea!

388
00:24:24,716 --> 00:24:26,173
- Teabag!
- Oh, that's nasty.

389
00:24:26,174 --> 00:24:27,551
- That's real gross.
- Bag, bag, bag!

390
00:24:27,552 --> 00:24:29,051
Please stop. Just please stop.

391
00:24:29,052 --> 00:24:31,095
Wait, you want some fucking lemon?
Yeah, bag it up!

392
00:24:31,096 --> 00:24:33,558
Come on! Jesus!

393
00:24:33,558 --> 00:24:35,726
I know that looked bad, but, come on,

394
00:24:35,727 --> 00:24:37,935
let's keep in mind
that the purpose of this competition

395
00:24:37,936 --> 00:24:39,271
is to kill people, yeah.

396
00:24:39,272 --> 00:24:41,732
So that was technically
not a hate crime.

397
00:24:41,733 --> 00:24:45,777
I'm not a racist. I got like eight black
guys on my fantasy football team.

398
00:24:45,778 --> 00:24:48,821
I mean, not the quarterback obviously,
that's a thinking man's position.

399
00:24:48,822 --> 00:24:50,325
Seriously?

400
00:24:52,911 --> 00:24:55,455
- Oh, no, not this!
- Fuck him! Go!

401
00:24:55,538 --> 00:24:56,789
Whatever.

402
00:25:02,295 --> 00:25:04,589
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

403
00:25:04,713 --> 00:25:07,632
Fuck, fuck, fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck!

404
00:25:07,633 --> 00:25:09,302
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

405
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:13,014
Fuck, fuck, fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck!

406
00:25:13,597 --> 00:25:16,766
I just watched Django get
kerb-stomped by a teddy bear,

407
00:25:16,767 --> 00:25:19,478
two of our friends are MIA,
and, oh, did I mention,

408
00:25:19,479 --> 00:25:21,979
did I mention this,
that my mouth still tastes like shit!

409
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,649
All right, dude, quit being a baby.

410
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:26,150
My ass still hurts, too.
You don't hear me whining about it.

411
00:25:26,151 --> 00:25:28,154
It just won't go away.

412
00:25:30,239 --> 00:25:31,990
What's happening, honkies?

413
00:25:31,991 --> 00:25:34,408
- What the hell? Really?
- That Asian guy!

414
00:25:34,409 --> 00:25:38,079
What? Oriental man cannot practise
acrobatics in the woods?

415
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,665
You racist assholes
think I'm Viet Cong or something?

416
00:25:40,666 --> 00:25:42,626
Wait, why the fuck are you here?

417
00:25:42,627 --> 00:25:45,587
We had a sick night last night.
I still hung over.

418
00:25:45,588 --> 00:25:47,631
Just tell us what the
fuck happened, okay?

419
00:25:47,632 --> 00:25:49,298
You mean you don't remember?

420
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:50,552
No.

421
00:25:50,969 --> 00:25:53,388
Human Centipede, bitches!

422
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:55,472
What's a Human Centipede?

423
00:25:55,473 --> 00:25:58,432
Human Centipede only the
greatest idea ever.

424
00:25:58,433 --> 00:26:01,478
You sew a chain of people
from asshole to mouth hole.

425
00:26:01,479 --> 00:26:04,064
You share the same digestive system.

426
00:26:04,065 --> 00:26:05,525
Check it out.

427
00:26:05,691 --> 00:26:07,443
We shit brothers!

428
00:26:08,236 --> 00:26:09,443
I was the middle.

429
00:26:09,444 --> 00:26:12,155
- No!
- What the fuck? Fuck!

430
00:26:12,156 --> 00:26:14,824
Why would we do that fucking...
That's disgusting!

431
00:26:14,825 --> 00:26:17,286
You have really potty mouth.

432
00:26:17,287 --> 00:26:19,372
You get it? Potty mouth!

433
00:26:19,414 --> 00:26:21,291
Because your mouth was potty.

434
00:26:26,128 --> 00:26:27,881
Just let it out, man.

435
00:26:28,006 --> 00:26:31,885
Wait, hold on. I was in the
front, so I didn't eat any shit?

436
00:26:31,885 --> 00:26:34,721
Nope. You were total party pooper.

437
00:26:35,013 --> 00:26:36,264
Literally.

438
00:26:36,681 --> 00:26:39,016
Well, that's a relief, huh?

439
00:26:39,017 --> 00:26:40,852
That's disgusting.

440
00:26:41,685 --> 00:26:43,396
It's getting really late.

441
00:26:43,478 --> 00:26:44,895
You know what they say

442
00:26:44,897 --> 00:26:47,481
early to bed, early
to Human Centipede.

443
00:26:47,482 --> 00:26:49,610
I gotta go Human Centipede
with the Olsen twins.

444
00:26:49,611 --> 00:26:51,319
They've done it before.

445
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,906
See you gay boys later.

446
00:26:57,702 --> 00:27:00,536
Let's find a place to sleep, buddy.
It's been a long day.

447
00:27:00,537 --> 00:27:02,205
Oh, Jesus!

448
00:27:02,207 --> 00:27:05,001
- I didn't eat corn.
- Yeah, I did.

449
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:15,551
Shit, human shit inside me.

450
00:27:15,552 --> 00:27:18,181
Hey, man, we've all been there.

451
00:27:19,057 --> 00:27:20,433
Really?

452
00:27:20,433 --> 00:27:22,517
Fuck no, I've never been there.

453
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:24,518
It's the most disgusting
thing I've ever heard.

454
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:25,855
It is real gross.

455
00:27:25,897 --> 00:27:28,105
Hey, shit-for-breath,
be quiet for a second.

456
00:27:28,106 --> 00:27:30,901
Look over there.
Someone's got a fire going.

457
00:27:30,902 --> 00:27:33,321
- That's dumb.
- Yup.

458
00:27:34,781 --> 00:27:37,658
I appreciate
the spirited conversation, gentlemen,

459
00:27:37,659 --> 00:27:39,533
but we all know there's no debate.

460
00:27:39,534 --> 00:27:42,203
I am the weirdest of all the Depps.

461
00:27:42,204 --> 00:27:47,293
I mean, for fuck's sake, I'm a pirate
who sashays round like a bloody poof.

462
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:51,339
And what of you there, top hat?

463
00:27:51,381 --> 00:27:54,299
Well, I do have my fair share of
psychological issues.

464
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,135
My speech patterns
mirror those of sexual molesters.

465
00:27:57,136 --> 00:28:00,014
I keep a bunch of
dwarves as my slaves.

466
00:28:01,808 --> 00:28:04,352
And I masturbate in the chocolate.

467
00:28:05,102 --> 00:28:07,522
Every single batch.

468
00:28:07,564 --> 00:28:09,566
I think I might puke.

469
00:28:21,326 --> 00:28:23,203
Nice work, Tonto.

470
00:28:23,204 --> 00:28:25,162
Say good night, weirdos.

471
00:28:25,163 --> 00:28:27,124
A bloody smoke signal!

472
00:28:27,125 --> 00:28:29,584
You fucked us, you bloody Native!

473
00:28:29,585 --> 00:28:31,336
Tonto sick of white man.

474
00:28:31,337 --> 00:28:33,256
Yes, but we're all Depps, mate!

475
00:28:33,589 --> 00:28:36,551
Tonto especially sick of Depps.

476
00:28:36,675 --> 00:28:38,636
Are you gonna rape and murder us?

477
00:28:38,802 --> 00:28:41,556
Keep it in your pants, Scissorhands.

478
00:28:47,729 --> 00:28:49,689
Me next! Me next!

479
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:55,195
If you don't mind,
I prefer it in a chocolate factory.

480
00:29:00,616 --> 00:29:02,035
That's brutal.

481
00:29:02,827 --> 00:29:05,079
Now that's what I call a deep throat.

482
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:08,874
That means a dozen gone
in the first eight hours, Stephen A,

483
00:29:08,875 --> 00:29:12,337
and I think I smell
an alliance forming.

484
00:29:12,377 --> 00:29:15,296
What the fuck do you
mean, an alliance?

485
00:29:15,297 --> 00:29:18,841
If it's supposed to be every man for himself,
they ain't gonna create no fucking alliance.

486
00:29:18,842 --> 00:29:20,636
They're gonna be out there
killing each other.

487
00:29:20,637 --> 00:29:23,054
That don't make no goddamn sense!

488
00:29:23,055 --> 00:29:26,016
I know. I can barely keep myself
from killing you, Stephen A.

489
00:29:26,017 --> 00:29:27,810
Can't fault you there.

490
00:29:30,854 --> 00:29:32,688
That creepy, pale guy was bananas!

491
00:29:32,689 --> 00:29:34,399
B-A-N-A-N-A-S!

492
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,402
Hey, Thor, we get it. You like cock.

493
00:29:37,237 --> 00:29:38,862
Fuck, dude.

494
00:29:38,863 --> 00:29:40,364
Don't stay here, don't stay here,
don't stay here.

495
00:29:40,365 --> 00:29:43,327
Anyway, guys, I'm pooped.
What say we just stay here for the night?

496
00:29:43,659 --> 00:29:46,454
Do you guys think there's
a Chili's out here?

497
00:29:47,247 --> 00:29:50,500
I'll settle for an Applebee's,
but it would be grudgingly.

498
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,502
What the fuck is he doing with them?

499
00:29:53,503 --> 00:29:56,880
I think he's looking for a reasonably
priced casual dining restaurant.

500
00:29:56,881 --> 00:29:58,090
Thor?

501
00:29:58,091 --> 00:29:59,884
Awesome Blossom?

502
00:30:00,426 --> 00:30:02,887
Tonto? Jalapeno poppers?

503
00:30:03,346 --> 00:30:05,180
Something for you, Bloody?

504
00:30:05,181 --> 00:30:07,682
If you talk to me again,
I will murder your whole family

505
00:30:07,683 --> 00:30:11,269
and terrorise whatever little Podunk
town you come from, you hear me?

506
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:15,149
Okay, more fully loaded
potato skins for me then.

507
00:30:15,232 --> 00:30:16,692
How about a bear claw?

508
00:30:16,693 --> 00:30:18,820
Maybe a bun for the wiener?

509
00:30:19,237 --> 00:30:22,949
All right, table for six, seven.
Ladies?

510
00:30:23,616 --> 00:30:25,534
You know, I don't think
we fit the dress code.

511
00:30:25,535 --> 00:30:28,580
Oh, it's a Chili's.
You guys will be fine.

512
00:30:31,958 --> 00:30:33,749
I kill him now, yes?

513
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:34,959
No.

514
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,586
Let's lock him in a burning gymnasium

515
00:30:36,587 --> 00:30:39,883
and wait till his guttural screams
slowly fade away.

516
00:30:40,133 --> 00:30:41,968
Easy, Scary.

517
00:30:41,968 --> 00:30:44,971
We need to keep that fat sack
of Asperger's alive for now.

518
00:30:45,305 --> 00:30:48,473
He's our best shot at finding
those two other fuck nuggets.

519
00:30:48,474 --> 00:30:51,978
Would you guys shush already?
I need to get my beauty sleep.

520
00:30:54,397 --> 00:30:56,566
I'm never gonna be able to sleep now.

521
00:30:57,108 --> 00:30:59,777
I'm gonna have insomnia for sure.

522
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,657
This was the worst day ever.

523
00:31:32,309 --> 00:31:33,728
What the...

524
00:31:33,977 --> 00:31:35,354
Shit!

525
00:31:35,355 --> 00:31:38,024
Jesus! Shut up, Ed.

526
00:31:38,024 --> 00:31:40,151
They hit me with a fucking boulder.

527
00:31:40,692 --> 00:31:41,986
Hey!

528
00:31:45,323 --> 00:31:47,158
She seems friendly.

529
00:31:51,829 --> 00:31:53,372
What are you nodding at?

530
00:31:53,373 --> 00:31:54,874
I don't...

531
00:31:57,167 --> 00:31:59,045
Use your fucking words!

532
00:32:09,514 --> 00:32:13,516
She wants us to saw the hive off
so that it falls onto them below.

533
00:32:13,517 --> 00:32:15,228
No fuckin' shit.

534
00:32:16,855 --> 00:32:18,898
Vulgar little child.

535
00:32:19,022 --> 00:32:21,568
Oh, I have a Swiss Army knife.

536
00:32:22,026 --> 00:32:23,403
Okay.

537
00:32:25,655 --> 00:32:29,074
Hey, you know, I'm not really athletic.
Do you mind just climbing up there?

538
00:32:29,075 --> 00:32:31,035
- Take one for the team?
- Come on.

539
00:32:32,077 --> 00:32:33,413
Nice.

540
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:41,087
Oh, snap! Now looky here.

541
00:32:41,087 --> 00:32:44,381
Them motherfucking hungover honkies
got a trick up their sleeve.

542
00:32:44,382 --> 00:32:46,592
Is that a Swagger Jacker nest, Skip?

543
00:32:46,593 --> 00:32:49,218
Correct, you are. Now these guys
are gonna have to be careful.

544
00:32:49,219 --> 00:32:52,222
Swagger Jackers are no ordinary bees.

545
00:32:52,223 --> 00:32:54,223
They are genetically engineered wasps

546
00:32:54,224 --> 00:32:55,558
that when they sting you,

547
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:58,394
they drain your body's
natural swagger supply.

548
00:32:58,395 --> 00:33:01,522
In other words,
they make you a straight bitch.

549
00:33:01,523 --> 00:33:04,819
Precisely. And just a few stings
can prove lethal.

550
00:33:05,402 --> 00:33:07,696
I'm crossing my fingers, Skip.

551
00:33:07,697 --> 00:33:09,032
Me, too.

552
00:33:16,247 --> 00:33:18,958
I know you aren't trying
to cut down our nest!

553
00:33:21,084 --> 00:33:23,338
- Does that hurt?
- Yes, it hurt!

554
00:33:23,338 --> 00:33:25,632
Dude, don't be a pussy. Saw!

555
00:33:28,259 --> 00:33:29,677
Oh, God.

556
00:33:32,804 --> 00:33:35,308
They're not gonna sleep in much longer.
Hurry up, man!

557
00:33:38,518 --> 00:33:39,728
Hurry up!

558
00:33:39,729 --> 00:33:41,481
Get away from the nest, jerk-off!

559
00:33:45,275 --> 00:33:47,403
One flew in my fucking hole!

560
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,166
Oh, Jesus.

561
00:34:03,085 --> 00:34:04,503
Hey, you okay?

562
00:34:04,504 --> 00:34:07,131
A couple of Swagger
Jack-offs stung me.

563
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:10,091
But I'm good.

564
00:34:10,092 --> 00:34:12,094
Hey, hey, hey, you sure?
You don't look too good.

565
00:34:12,095 --> 00:34:15,348
- I don't feel too good.
- No, no, no, no! Bradley!

566
00:34:20,895 --> 00:34:22,522
I'm coming for you!

567
00:34:23,355 --> 00:34:25,149
You guys see that?

568
00:34:25,859 --> 00:34:27,442
Shit! Shit!

569
00:34:27,443 --> 00:34:29,320
This jerk has literally no swag.

570
00:34:30,488 --> 00:34:33,449
Hey! I was looking all
over for you guys!

571
00:34:41,165 --> 00:34:43,000
God, my face hurts.

572
00:34:43,001 --> 00:34:45,793
Oh, I can feel my
heartbeat in my ears.

573
00:34:45,794 --> 00:34:47,378
- It's throbbing.
- It's really loud.

574
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:50,550
- Hey. Does my head look weird?
- It's so loud.

575
00:34:50,592 --> 00:34:51,757
No.

576
00:34:51,758 --> 00:34:54,012
But your body is super tiny.

577
00:34:55,971 --> 00:34:57,347
It is?

578
00:34:57,348 --> 00:34:59,559
Your body is super tiny, man.

579
00:34:59,726 --> 00:35:01,561
Do I look okay?

580
00:35:02,896 --> 00:35:04,230
Yeah.

581
00:35:05,773 --> 00:35:06,939
You're cool.

582
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:09,027
I am cool, thank you.

583
00:35:09,192 --> 00:35:11,779
This is napping cool time for me.

584
00:35:13,323 --> 00:35:15,950
This is a terrible pillow.

585
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:18,578
Sleep sounds good.

586
00:35:33,676 --> 00:35:34,928
Hi.

587
00:35:35,219 --> 00:35:36,930
I've missed you.

588
00:35:37,262 --> 00:35:39,641
I've missed you, too, Katnip.

589
00:35:40,265 --> 00:35:43,227
- I'm only 17.
- What?

590
00:35:43,228 --> 00:35:44,435
Nothing.

591
00:35:44,436 --> 00:35:47,023
I have something to show you.

592
00:35:50,275 --> 00:35:51,528
Yes.

593
00:35:51,693 --> 00:35:52,946
Yes.

594
00:35:54,905 --> 00:35:56,449
No!

595
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:59,952
Why?

596
00:35:59,953 --> 00:36:03,413
Hey, are you having a
wet hallucination, Ed?

597
00:36:03,414 --> 00:36:06,041
Yeah, you know, a nocturnal emission?

598
00:36:06,042 --> 00:36:09,670
God, just when I thought
I couldn't hate you any more.

599
00:36:09,671 --> 00:36:13,340
Hey, ease up.
We didn't choose this way of life.

600
00:36:13,341 --> 00:36:15,552
Yeah, it's no picnic.

601
00:36:15,635 --> 00:36:18,469
You know how hard it is
to motorboat yourself?

602
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:19,973
God, please don't do it.

603
00:36:22,308 --> 00:36:24,310
This is the worst wet
dream of my life.

604
00:36:24,477 --> 00:36:25,643
See?

605
00:36:25,644 --> 00:36:27,895
Zach, how can you even ruin boobs?

606
00:36:27,896 --> 00:36:30,650
Hey, does my mouth
look like a nipple?

607
00:36:34,444 --> 00:36:36,155
It kinda does.

608
00:36:37,739 --> 00:36:40,450
Okay, this is getting weird.
Maybe we should wake him up.

609
00:36:40,451 --> 00:36:41,909
Okay, okay, okay.

610
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:43,413
On my count.

611
00:36:43,453 --> 00:36:47,208
One, two, three!

612
00:36:47,666 --> 00:36:48,917
Boom!

613
00:36:48,918 --> 00:36:50,253
Boobies!

614
00:36:56,634 --> 00:36:58,261
How long have we been out, man?

615
00:36:58,303 --> 00:36:59,635
Couple days.

616
00:36:59,636 --> 00:37:01,930
- I've been licking your wounds.
- What?

617
00:37:01,931 --> 00:37:04,933
I've been watching you guys sleep,
nursing you back to health.

618
00:37:04,934 --> 00:37:08,313
Scrotal touching
was just for medicinal purposes.

619
00:37:09,314 --> 00:37:12,774
We saw those
Swagger Jackers sting you, man. A lot.

620
00:37:12,775 --> 00:37:16,653
Yeah, but their venom has no effect
if you have no swagger to jack.

621
00:37:16,654 --> 00:37:18,698
Hold on a second.

622
00:37:19,032 --> 00:37:21,242
What the hell
were you doing with that gang, man?

623
00:37:24,661 --> 00:37:26,539
You were gonna help them kill us?

624
00:37:27,664 --> 00:37:30,083
You guys, I don't do
well with peer pressure.

625
00:37:30,084 --> 00:37:32,629
I didn't really want to murder you.

626
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:35,131
But you would have?

627
00:37:38,717 --> 00:37:40,052
Oh, come on!

628
00:37:40,053 --> 00:37:42,012
I'm sorry! I had a
moment of weakness!

629
00:37:42,013 --> 00:37:45,016
I nursed you back to health.
Don't you feel swaggy?

630
00:37:45,974 --> 00:37:47,184
Yeah.

631
00:37:47,185 --> 00:37:48,561
Yeah.

632
00:37:48,728 --> 00:37:50,730
I really do, actually.

633
00:37:51,146 --> 00:37:52,564
It's because of this.

634
00:37:52,565 --> 00:37:53,900
Swagger Balm.

635
00:37:57,027 --> 00:37:59,696
"Ingredients, aloe, palm oil,

636
00:37:59,697 --> 00:38:02,408
"and Kanye West extract?"

637
00:38:02,408 --> 00:38:04,994
Tastes just like the real thing.

638
00:38:06,411 --> 00:38:07,995
Hey, boys.

639
00:38:07,996 --> 00:38:09,958
We thought we smelt some swagger.

640
00:38:11,709 --> 00:38:13,086
Puts the rocks down, buddy.

641
00:38:14,545 --> 00:38:18,591
I just wanna get sloppy
drunk and slutty!

642
00:38:19,008 --> 00:38:21,427
Way too late for that, sweetheart.

643
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:24,430
- I get the blondes.
- Okay.

644
00:38:26,891 --> 00:38:28,601
That's rich!

645
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:33,648
So then I divorced that asshole
and took half of everything.

646
00:38:33,939 --> 00:38:36,651
That's how I got my lucky charm.

647
00:38:36,943 --> 00:38:39,444
Is it that ring? It's lovely.

648
00:38:39,445 --> 00:38:41,446
I'm not talking about that.

649
00:38:41,447 --> 00:38:42,905
I'm talking about

650
00:38:42,906 --> 00:38:44,158
this.

651
00:38:44,576 --> 00:38:46,450
Is that a fucking ball?

652
00:38:46,451 --> 00:38:48,204
Neat!

653
00:38:49,747 --> 00:38:54,126
I told you, when I took half of
everything, I meant half of everything.

654
00:38:54,127 --> 00:38:56,961
You girls are such a treat.

655
00:38:56,962 --> 00:38:58,755
Great! Here's to good friends!

656
00:38:58,756 --> 00:39:00,175
And you two bitches.

657
00:39:01,592 --> 00:39:03,634
Well, well, well,

658
00:39:03,635 --> 00:39:06,138
if it isn't the popular girls.

659
00:39:06,139 --> 00:39:08,684
Nice blood outfit, honey,
but that's worse than pleather.

660
00:39:08,891 --> 00:39:11,559
What is that, O positive?

661
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,186
- Awful.
- So last season.

662
00:39:13,188 --> 00:39:15,440
- Oh, my God!
- You got that on my Gucci dress!

663
00:39:15,606 --> 00:39:16,858
Bitch!

664
00:39:17,232 --> 00:39:20,153
- What are you doing?
- Do you know how much this cost?

665
00:39:21,904 --> 00:39:23,904
Wait, I just wanna see
where this is going!

666
00:39:23,906 --> 00:39:25,491
Zach, let's go!

667
00:39:25,991 --> 00:39:28,620
- Game, set...
- No! No!

668
00:39:29,454 --> 00:39:30,997
match!

669
00:39:33,916 --> 00:39:37,128
My tits are gonna melt!

670
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:48,306
You wanted to see me,
President Snowbama?

671
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:52,227
Tell me, have you ever been hungover?

672
00:39:52,643 --> 00:39:54,354
Why, yes.

673
00:39:54,521 --> 00:39:57,023
I'm actually hungover right now.

674
00:39:57,356 --> 00:39:59,943
Never pass out in a crowded bar.

675
00:40:00,693 --> 00:40:03,738
Yes, they shaved a
dick on my face, sir.

676
00:40:04,531 --> 00:40:08,409
These hungover contestants,
people seem to care about them.

677
00:40:08,951 --> 00:40:11,535
Yes? Is that a bad thing, sir?

678
00:40:11,536 --> 00:40:13,664
The Games are a distraction

679
00:40:13,665 --> 00:40:16,207
so people won't notice
the crap we peddle out.

680
00:40:16,208 --> 00:40:19,504
Sequels, remakes, spoofs.

681
00:40:21,338 --> 00:40:23,839
When people start to care,
bad things happen.

682
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,259
Ratings go down,

683
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,554
beards get shaved.

684
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:29,764
I've got it under control, sir.

685
00:40:40,732 --> 00:40:42,569
It's a kitty cat.

686
00:40:42,734 --> 00:40:44,904
'Cause you're a little pussy.

687
00:40:48,907 --> 00:40:51,119
Thank you, Mr President.

688
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:58,874
Shit! Any one of these cannon blasts
could be Doug.

689
00:40:58,876 --> 00:41:00,711
We don't even know
if he's still alive.

690
00:41:00,712 --> 00:41:03,338
Hey, I'm scared, too, but the one
thing that's not gonna get us

691
00:41:03,339 --> 00:41:05,885
back to that gay wedding
is sitting here crying about it.

692
00:41:05,925 --> 00:41:08,428
There should only be
a handful of contestants left.

693
00:41:09,095 --> 00:41:11,598
- We can do this, man.
- You guys.

694
00:41:12,098 --> 00:41:15,350
Hey, since we're standing around
sharing things, I've got a doozy.

695
00:41:15,351 --> 00:41:17,353
What the hell did you do, Zach?

696
00:41:17,353 --> 00:41:19,605
You know the air fresheners
that I plugged in?

697
00:41:19,606 --> 00:41:21,188
- Best thing you ever did.
- They were delightful.

698
00:41:21,189 --> 00:41:26,194
Well, it wasn't Lilac or Morning Mist
or Brazilian Breeze.

699
00:41:26,196 --> 00:41:27,946
It was Midnight Berry.

700
00:41:27,947 --> 00:41:29,908
What the shit is Midnight Berry?

701
00:41:29,949 --> 00:41:33,036
From the novels. It's aromatic.

702
00:41:33,285 --> 00:41:35,788
What's so bad about that?

703
00:41:36,206 --> 00:41:38,291
Well, I didn't finish my thought.

704
00:41:39,082 --> 00:41:42,419
It's aromatic, poisonous and lethal.

705
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,295
What the fuck is wrong with you?

706
00:41:44,296 --> 00:41:46,089
Are you kidding me?

707
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:48,050
I think you guys
are getting hung up on the fact

708
00:41:48,051 --> 00:41:50,051
that it's poisonous and lethal.

709
00:41:50,052 --> 00:41:52,013
They smell fresh.

710
00:41:52,179 --> 00:41:53,431
Smell.

711
00:41:54,307 --> 00:41:55,808
- Jesus!
- Fuck, man!

712
00:41:55,975 --> 00:41:57,310
God!

713
00:41:59,187 --> 00:42:01,271
Yeah, it says right
here on the label,

714
00:42:01,272 --> 00:42:05,776
"May cause transportation
to futuristic dystopia."

715
00:42:05,777 --> 00:42:06,902
"May."

716
00:42:06,903 --> 00:42:09,153
You're the reason we're here,
you sausage-fingered fuck!

717
00:42:09,154 --> 00:42:11,740
- This is all your fault!
- Hey, you said you liked the scent!

718
00:42:11,741 --> 00:42:13,700
Because I like floral scents!

719
00:42:13,701 --> 00:42:14,826
Well, there, he said it!

720
00:42:14,827 --> 00:42:17,747
So now I forgive you guys
and we can move forward!

721
00:42:17,747 --> 00:42:18,997
I...

722
00:42:18,998 --> 00:42:22,001
I hope you die out here.

723
00:42:23,503 --> 00:42:24,628
No.

724
00:42:24,629 --> 00:42:26,422
You fucked up.

725
00:42:29,342 --> 00:42:31,302
That was harsh.

726
00:42:41,687 --> 00:42:44,481
The sloth is heading towards
the soup pot. Over.

727
00:42:44,482 --> 00:42:46,693
10-4, squaw without bra.

728
00:42:47,276 --> 00:42:48,570
Nice.

729
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:51,114
Yeah. Real nice.

730
00:42:53,699 --> 00:42:55,826
Stupid Midnight Berry!

731
00:42:55,827 --> 00:42:59,205
Why does something so fragrant
have to be so bad?

732
00:43:00,455 --> 00:43:03,334
Thank God, thank God. Thank God.

733
00:43:17,724 --> 00:43:21,019
Okay. Get outta the way.
Get outta the way.

734
00:43:25,523 --> 00:43:27,940
Yeah, that's more like it.

735
00:43:27,941 --> 00:43:29,194
There.

736
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,076
I thought I'd never say this,
but Daddy wants blue balls.

737
00:43:55,552 --> 00:43:57,805
Attention, everyone. Attention.

738
00:43:57,972 --> 00:44:00,765
We have some new rules for you kids.

739
00:44:00,766 --> 00:44:02,308
From this point forward

740
00:44:02,309 --> 00:44:07,521
contestants of colour will be
granted special consideration.

741
00:44:07,522 --> 00:44:10,276
Yes, I'm talking about
affirmative action, people.

742
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,861
- It's the 21st century...
- Zach!

743
00:44:16,531 --> 00:44:17,992
Whatever you say.

744
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:22,579
I think I speak for all of us when
I ask you to give us some privacy.

745
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:24,332
With pleasure.

746
00:44:27,126 --> 00:44:29,128
Boys, have at him.

747
00:44:31,965 --> 00:44:33,465
Nice weave, bitch.

748
00:44:33,466 --> 00:44:36,427
Her hair is all natural.
Take that back!

749
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:39,639
You wanna kill her, you
gotta kill me first.

750
00:44:46,603 --> 00:44:49,148
Blue scalp. Rarest of scalps.

751
00:44:50,315 --> 00:44:51,901
Your turn, dumpy.

752
00:44:56,948 --> 00:44:58,283
Yeah!

753
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:05,540
Gratuitous nudity
no match for gratuitous violence.

754
00:45:35,945 --> 00:45:38,114
Farewell, my princess.

755
00:45:42,492 --> 00:45:44,829
Maybe just one more squeeze.

756
00:45:48,874 --> 00:45:49,918
Go in a bit tighter.

757
00:45:51,835 --> 00:45:54,422
What the hell is he doing?

758
00:45:58,550 --> 00:45:59,843
- Nothing on three.
- I don't know.

759
00:45:59,844 --> 00:46:01,262
Oh, no.

760
00:46:02,846 --> 00:46:04,265
Oh, no.

761
00:46:06,391 --> 00:46:09,312
Vivian, would you
please get IT in here?

762
00:46:09,854 --> 00:46:11,480
Oy vey.

763
00:46:11,481 --> 00:46:13,065
What up, bitches?

764
00:46:13,066 --> 00:46:15,316
- You fix computers?
- Hell yeah!

765
00:46:15,317 --> 00:46:19,489
I may be sociopathic gangster,
but I'm still Asian, motherfuckers!

766
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:21,197
What?

767
00:46:21,198 --> 00:46:23,909
No, no, no, I really don't think you
should be messing around with that...

768
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:25,286
Finished!

769
00:46:26,245 --> 00:46:27,872
Excellent.

770
00:46:28,706 --> 00:46:30,166
Thank you.

771
00:46:32,584 --> 00:46:34,754
We're back up, people.

772
00:46:35,922 --> 00:46:39,259
Oh, come on, Zach! That not cool.

773
00:46:40,051 --> 00:46:42,051
Excuse me. You may leave now.

774
00:46:42,052 --> 00:46:44,053
- What, I get no tip?
- No.

775
00:46:44,054 --> 00:46:46,348
I take cash, credit, no cheque.

776
00:46:46,349 --> 00:46:48,892
- But I'll take a bump of coke.
- All right, get the hell out of here.

777
00:46:48,893 --> 00:46:50,478
Chop-chop!

778
00:46:52,605 --> 00:46:55,108
What to do, what to do?

779
00:46:56,108 --> 00:46:58,653
You wanna get the ratings up?

780
00:46:59,069 --> 00:47:01,906
I got one word for you,

781
00:47:04,241 --> 00:47:06,160
bromance.

782
00:47:06,535 --> 00:47:09,495
That's not a real word.

783
00:47:09,496 --> 00:47:12,584
You wanna give these
districts a story?

784
00:47:14,127 --> 00:47:18,923
Well, you need to keep
these guys together.

785
00:47:19,257 --> 00:47:20,592
Not separate.

786
00:47:24,888 --> 00:47:27,307
I got one word for you,

787
00:47:28,932 --> 00:47:30,351
heroin.

788
00:47:31,977 --> 00:47:34,687
"Heroin" is the one word?

789
00:47:34,688 --> 00:47:35,940
No.

790
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:38,400
I'm just really looking for some.
You holding?

791
00:47:38,401 --> 00:47:39,775
I'm sorry.

792
00:47:39,776 --> 00:47:41,988
I got one word for you,

793
00:47:44,157 --> 00:47:45,656
dicksauce.

794
00:47:45,657 --> 00:47:47,951
"Dicksauce"? "Dicksauce"
is the one word?

795
00:47:47,952 --> 00:47:49,453
You can't buy that shit.

796
00:47:49,454 --> 00:47:52,874
Well, thank you.
Your time here has been so valuable.

797
00:47:59,881 --> 00:48:01,633
Bromance.

798
00:48:07,846 --> 00:48:09,641
Hey, hey, hey.

799
00:48:09,807 --> 00:48:11,559
Is that water?

800
00:48:11,809 --> 00:48:14,229
Fuck it, I'm thirsty as hell!

801
00:48:16,523 --> 00:48:18,774
Don't put your mouth on that.
It's gross.

802
00:48:18,775 --> 00:48:20,527
Do you think it's filtered?

803
00:48:20,984 --> 00:48:23,738
- Really?
- I only drink bottled water.

804
00:48:24,196 --> 00:48:26,614
- Didn't you just have shit in your mouth?
- All right! Fine!

805
00:48:26,615 --> 00:48:28,992
I didn't intentionally
have shit in my mouth.

806
00:48:28,993 --> 00:48:30,662
It tastes a lot like blood, though.

807
00:48:31,536 --> 00:48:32,663
What?

808
00:48:32,664 --> 00:48:35,374
Check, check. Hot mic. Hot mic.

809
00:48:35,375 --> 00:48:38,044
Attention, everyone. Attention.

810
00:48:38,168 --> 00:48:40,711
There has been a change in the rules.

811
00:48:40,712 --> 00:48:45,217
Yes, from now on,
multiple victors may be crowned

812
00:48:45,218 --> 00:48:50,014
if they survive the Games
and share a long-standing bond

813
00:48:50,138 --> 00:48:52,848
of exceptional male bromance.

814
00:48:52,849 --> 00:48:54,350
They can do that?

815
00:48:54,351 --> 00:48:57,187
Yes, I am allowed to do this.

816
00:48:57,188 --> 00:48:59,731
I can do whatever the fuck I want,
I'm the motherfucking Gamesman!

817
00:48:59,732 --> 00:49:00,857
Noted.

818
00:49:00,859 --> 00:49:03,234
So good luck to you all

819
00:49:03,235 --> 00:49:06,865
and may the probabilities
be ever to your liking.

820
00:49:08,575 --> 00:49:11,075
So that means we can all
get out of this alive.

821
00:49:11,076 --> 00:49:13,496
All we have to do is find Doug and

822
00:49:13,537 --> 00:49:15,746
- Zach! Zach!
- Zach! Zach!

823
00:49:15,747 --> 00:49:17,000
We're sorry, buddy!

824
00:49:18,209 --> 00:49:19,711
Zach!

825
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:23,256
Where are you, man?

826
00:49:24,799 --> 00:49:26,759
You dropped your glasses.

827
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:30,138
Hey, quick question.

828
00:49:30,513 --> 00:49:33,431
If they can just change
the rules at any time,

829
00:49:33,432 --> 00:49:36,352
why don't they just pick who they
want to win and make it happen?

830
00:49:37,227 --> 00:49:39,062
This is confusing to me.

831
00:49:39,063 --> 00:49:41,608
Don't worry about it, man.
It's just a plot hole.

832
00:49:43,109 --> 00:49:45,278
- Hold on a sec.
- What?

833
00:49:45,278 --> 00:49:48,238
Zach said they used these birds
to find each other in the book.

834
00:49:48,239 --> 00:49:50,617
Like by whistling to them.

835
00:49:50,867 --> 00:49:52,577
Worth a shot.

836
00:49:59,416 --> 00:50:01,878
- Yeah, that worked.
- Shut up.

837
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,797
- All right, one more time. Damn it.
- Sure, I'll help.

838
00:50:07,717 --> 00:50:09,801
Suck my bird cock!

839
00:50:09,802 --> 00:50:11,261
- Come on!
- Really?

840
00:50:11,262 --> 00:50:13,430
Marco! Marco!

841
00:50:13,431 --> 00:50:16,392
- We don't have time for this!
- Marco!

842
00:50:17,602 --> 00:50:19,936
Why couldn't you just say, "Polo"?

843
00:50:19,937 --> 00:50:21,479
There you are.

844
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:23,105
Listen, not that I give a hoot,

845
00:50:23,106 --> 00:50:27,193
but your fat friend Zach's about a
half mile away from here with Katnip.

846
00:50:27,194 --> 00:50:28,445
How do you know?

847
00:50:28,446 --> 00:50:30,113
A little birdie told me.

848
00:50:30,114 --> 00:50:34,826
And by a little birdie, I mean a
chickadee who gave me a beakjob.

849
00:50:34,827 --> 00:50:37,578
You want to find
this overgrown garden gnome?

850
00:50:37,579 --> 00:50:40,834
- Yeah. And Katnip.
- And stop fucking yelling, man.

851
00:50:48,383 --> 00:50:52,846
Anyway, that's why I'm not allowed
to go near schools any more.

852
00:50:53,845 --> 00:50:55,304
Good to know.

853
00:50:55,305 --> 00:50:56,724
Yeah!

854
00:50:57,183 --> 00:50:59,475
You guys! Oh, my God!

855
00:50:59,476 --> 00:51:01,271
I missed you guys so much!

856
00:51:04,731 --> 00:51:06,357
Yeah. Okay.

857
00:51:06,358 --> 00:51:07,735
Where's Katnip?

858
00:51:07,943 --> 00:51:09,696
She's over there.

859
00:51:11,947 --> 00:51:13,990
You've got the talking jay!

860
00:51:13,991 --> 00:51:17,536
Sorry, Bradley, but this guy
just made me crap down your shirt.

861
00:51:17,537 --> 00:51:19,370
Everything he says is so foul!

862
00:51:19,371 --> 00:51:21,582
- Yeah, he says disgusting stuff.
- Come on!

863
00:51:21,583 --> 00:51:24,377
Where are we going? Fuck.

864
00:51:36,890 --> 00:51:39,392
Maybe I should tell her I'm...

865
00:51:39,725 --> 00:51:41,769
No, no, I should not.

866
00:51:43,896 --> 00:51:45,732
Wow, yeah, this is not...

867
00:51:46,232 --> 00:51:48,818
This isn't pervy at all. Yes, it is.

868
00:51:51,404 --> 00:51:53,823
Hey! Perverted ass cracker!

869
00:51:53,990 --> 00:51:55,325
Hey!

870
00:51:55,908 --> 00:51:57,992
Trees are nice here.

871
00:51:57,993 --> 00:51:59,245
Ed!

872
00:52:00,495 --> 00:52:02,455
Oh, my God, you're okay!

873
00:52:02,456 --> 00:52:03,791
Hey!

874
00:52:08,378 --> 00:52:13,760
That is a respect boner.
A boner achieved out of respect.

875
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:16,930
You know I'm 17, right?

876
00:52:17,221 --> 00:52:19,389
What? I can't hear you!
It just got real loud in here!

877
00:52:19,390 --> 00:52:21,849
- Hey, guys, hey.
- Hi.

878
00:52:21,850 --> 00:52:24,771
- No sign of Doug?
- Nope. Nothing.

879
00:52:26,605 --> 00:52:28,230
Wait a minute.

880
00:52:28,232 --> 00:52:31,359
He came with your district. You were
the last one to see him at the arena.

881
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:34,113
Do you have any idea where he went?

882
00:52:35,698 --> 00:52:39,744
Well, do you feel like telling us?

883
00:52:41,412 --> 00:52:44,581
- Okay, I've had about enough of this.
- Hey, hey, hey, come on!

884
00:52:44,582 --> 00:52:47,168
That's like a triple hate crime.

885
00:52:47,252 --> 00:52:48,503
Hey.

886
00:52:49,254 --> 00:52:51,296
They're just looking
for their friend.

887
00:52:51,297 --> 00:52:53,925
Do you want to tell them? For me?

888
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:07,814
You got Norsed!

889
00:53:08,272 --> 00:53:09,439
Shit!

890
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,025
What the hell is wrong with you?

891
00:53:14,195 --> 00:53:15,488
Oh, shit!

892
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:24,664
That took a while.
Who wants to go get margaritas?

893
00:53:24,664 --> 00:53:26,914
What the frick do we do now?

894
00:53:26,915 --> 00:53:30,503
I don't know, Zach, it's been a while since
I've had to battle the God of Thunder!

895
00:53:33,881 --> 00:53:35,383
Hey, blondie!

896
00:53:35,675 --> 00:53:37,677
Pick on someone your own size!

897
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:46,019
Yeah! Nice shot, Ed!

898
00:53:46,226 --> 00:53:50,062
I just killed a god.
Did you guys see...

899
00:53:50,063 --> 00:53:51,357
Oh, shit.

900
00:53:54,651 --> 00:53:55,904
Hey.

901
00:53:56,695 --> 00:53:58,865
You okay? Come on, wake up.

902
00:53:59,532 --> 00:54:01,993
You're a doctor, right?
You can help her.

903
00:54:02,492 --> 00:54:04,329
I'm a dentist.

904
00:54:04,871 --> 00:54:06,456
Check her teeth.

905
00:54:30,897 --> 00:54:33,274
You guys wanna hear some Wu-Tang?

906
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:36,694
She was so young.

907
00:54:36,818 --> 00:54:38,404
What a waste.

908
00:54:39,697 --> 00:54:40,949
There there, buddy.

909
00:54:40,989 --> 00:54:43,284
She had so much ahead for her.

910
00:54:43,409 --> 00:54:44,911
Her first kiss.

911
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:46,955
Her first handjob.

912
00:54:48,206 --> 00:54:50,250
Her first bukkake.

913
00:54:50,708 --> 00:54:52,541
Unless you guys wanna
give her a send-off.

914
00:54:52,543 --> 00:54:54,504
- No.
- Wow.

915
00:54:57,382 --> 00:54:59,133
She's at peace.

916
00:54:59,216 --> 00:55:01,636
Or in some dark, endless abyss.

917
00:55:08,767 --> 00:55:10,103
Wait.

918
00:55:10,727 --> 00:55:12,897
We need to pay our respects.

919
00:55:13,106 --> 00:55:14,691
With a salute.

920
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:25,535
Two in the pink.

921
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:27,619
One in the stink.

922
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:29,122
Forever.

923
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:50,433
Can I ask you a serious question?

924
00:55:50,434 --> 00:55:52,227
Yeah, anything, man.

925
00:55:52,228 --> 00:55:55,481
Which one's the pink
and which one's the stink?

926
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:57,441
Because they're both pinkish.

927
00:55:57,442 --> 00:55:59,319
And they both stink.

928
00:55:59,776 --> 00:56:01,029
Yeah.

929
00:56:01,070 --> 00:56:03,323
Remember when I told you
to ask me anything?

930
00:56:03,781 --> 00:56:05,240
Forget I said that.

931
00:56:05,241 --> 00:56:06,868
You don't know, do you?

932
00:56:06,868 --> 00:56:11,039
Hello. Attention, everyone.
Attention.

933
00:56:11,163 --> 00:56:13,498
It is my profound pleasure

934
00:56:13,499 --> 00:56:15,792
to invite you all to

935
00:56:15,793 --> 00:56:18,338
- a feast!
- Feast?

936
00:56:18,421 --> 00:56:21,007
And this will be no
ordinary occasion.

937
00:56:21,007 --> 00:56:23,634
We know that you all want something

938
00:56:23,635 --> 00:56:25,720
and you want it bad.

939
00:56:25,886 --> 00:56:29,182
And we are aiming
to be very generous hosts.

940
00:56:29,224 --> 00:56:33,184
Now, there will be some
weapons available,

941
00:56:33,185 --> 00:56:37,813
but I strongly suggest
that you all BYO weapon.

942
00:56:37,814 --> 00:56:41,025
Because I don't wanna get blamed
if we run out like the last time.

943
00:56:41,026 --> 00:56:42,445
That was embarrassing.

944
00:56:43,196 --> 00:56:48,034
I also really need
someone to bring ice.

945
00:56:48,117 --> 00:56:50,494
I had a sign-up sheet
at the Reaping.

946
00:56:50,495 --> 00:56:52,954
Nobody fucking chose ice.
What's the big deal?

947
00:56:52,955 --> 00:56:56,666
Come on, somebody.
Be a rock star. Own it.

948
00:56:56,667 --> 00:56:58,753
Ice, out.

949
00:56:59,087 --> 00:57:01,381
Has anyone seen a 7-Eleven out here?

950
00:57:02,381 --> 00:57:05,549
Attention, everyone. Attention.

951
00:57:05,551 --> 00:57:10,640
We are looking for a competitor named
Harry Ballsonya.

952
00:57:11,057 --> 00:57:12,725
Harry Ballsonya?

953
00:57:12,849 --> 00:57:16,061
Please report to
the control room immediately.

954
00:57:16,062 --> 00:57:18,855
I repeat, Harry Ballsonya.

955
00:57:18,857 --> 00:57:20,857
This will be the...

956
00:57:20,859 --> 00:57:23,611
Oh, damn it! Who did this?

957
00:57:23,903 --> 00:57:27,073
You're making me
look like a fucking asshole!

958
00:57:38,626 --> 00:57:41,004
We really should have brought ice.

959
00:57:41,336 --> 00:57:42,713
Don't worry about it.

960
00:57:42,714 --> 00:57:43,965
Hey!

961
00:57:44,089 --> 00:57:45,925
Is that a cell phone?

962
00:57:48,511 --> 00:57:49,760
Maybe we can use it
to call the wedding.

963
00:57:49,761 --> 00:57:51,597
Stall them or something.

964
00:57:51,598 --> 00:57:53,224
- I'm on it.
- Hey!

965
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,392
I wouldn't do that.

966
00:57:55,393 --> 00:57:57,729
See those lumps of dirt?

967
00:57:58,186 --> 00:57:59,729
Dog poops.

968
00:57:59,730 --> 00:58:01,316
Landmines.

969
00:58:01,608 --> 00:58:05,653
If you guys are gonna get through
this, you better watch your step.

970
00:58:05,778 --> 00:58:07,071
Check it out.

971
00:58:22,127 --> 00:58:25,548
Hey, when you said "you guys,"

972
00:58:25,965 --> 00:58:28,301
are you not coming with us?

973
00:58:28,635 --> 00:58:31,971
I need to go find Tonto and kill him,

974
00:58:32,388 --> 00:58:34,307
but this is for you.

975
00:58:38,268 --> 00:58:40,313
Yeah, if you...

976
00:58:40,812 --> 00:58:43,397
If you just wait, we'll go with you.

977
00:58:43,398 --> 00:58:45,652
We can protect you.

978
00:58:52,575 --> 00:58:54,911
- Oh, you're serious.
- Yeah.

979
00:58:55,662 --> 00:58:58,830
Look, the only reason
I don't want you guys coming with me

980
00:58:58,831 --> 00:59:01,123
is because you would
completely fuck it up.

981
00:59:01,124 --> 00:59:02,377
No offence.

982
00:59:03,670 --> 00:59:04,835
Okay.

983
00:59:04,836 --> 00:59:07,215
I really do love you.

984
00:59:09,007 --> 00:59:11,592
Frankly, I'm surprised
you're still alive.

985
00:59:11,593 --> 00:59:12,872
Okay, got it.

986
00:59:14,013 --> 00:59:15,515
Bye, Ed.

987
00:59:17,808 --> 00:59:19,853
Yup, bye, Katnip.

988
00:59:20,978 --> 00:59:22,856
- Be safe.
- Yeah.

989
00:59:26,109 --> 00:59:27,861
Try not to die.

990
00:59:34,325 --> 00:59:36,494
Sorry, buddy. She'll be back.

991
00:59:38,037 --> 00:59:41,666
Although unless she has a birthday in the
next couple of hours, she'll still be 17.

992
00:59:41,708 --> 00:59:43,751
Yeah, got it.

993
00:59:44,042 --> 00:59:46,837
I know we're in a futuristic dystopia
and everything,

994
00:59:46,838 --> 00:59:48,713
but jailbait is jailbait, brother.

995
00:59:48,714 --> 00:59:52,260
Yeah, what dating site did you
get her from? J-Bait?

996
00:59:52,468 --> 00:59:53,720
Get it?

997
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:56,222
Not now, Zach. But good one.

998
00:59:57,014 --> 00:59:58,933
Hey! Hey!

999
00:59:59,683 --> 01:00:01,476
What the fuck are you doing?

1000
01:00:01,477 --> 01:00:03,438
What Katnip would do.

1001
01:00:05,314 --> 01:00:07,692
Okay, I'm good. No. Shit.

1002
01:00:08,735 --> 01:00:10,403
God damn it.

1003
01:00:35,762 --> 01:00:37,013
What?

1004
01:00:40,265 --> 01:00:41,601
What?

1005
01:00:51,735 --> 01:00:52,987
Hi.

1006
01:00:56,157 --> 01:00:58,743
You mind if I just grab a weapon?

1007
01:01:12,465 --> 01:01:14,799
It's too bad you couldn't
help your friend.

1008
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,426
That generic straight man.
What was his name?

1009
01:01:16,427 --> 01:01:17,720
Doug.

1010
01:01:17,761 --> 01:01:19,929
And he's not a straight man.

1011
01:01:19,930 --> 01:01:22,932
Well, he's probably long dead.

1012
01:01:22,933 --> 01:01:24,183
And soon,

1013
01:01:24,184 --> 01:01:27,313
you'll be long dead, too.

1014
01:01:30,108 --> 01:01:31,860
This is for threatening my friend!

1015
01:01:31,942 --> 01:01:34,402
This is for being a bitch
to me in the woods!

1016
01:01:34,403 --> 01:01:36,487
This is for calling
my hometown "Podunk"!

1017
01:01:36,488 --> 01:01:39,032
This is for not returning my sexts!

1018
01:01:39,033 --> 01:01:42,370
And this is for ruining the prom!

1019
01:01:45,539 --> 01:01:47,415
Holy fucking shit.

1020
01:01:47,416 --> 01:01:49,836
You just brutally
murdered a young girl.

1021
01:01:49,919 --> 01:01:51,044
Yeah.

1022
01:01:51,045 --> 01:01:53,796
And the weird thing is
I thought it would take more hits.

1023
01:01:53,797 --> 01:01:55,800
But I guess you live and learn.

1024
01:01:55,966 --> 01:01:59,344
Or at least, she doesn't. Am I right?
Am I right?

1025
01:01:59,345 --> 01:02:01,806
- Yeah, whatever you say.
- Of course.

1026
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:05,601
All right, look,
we can still get out of this thing.

1027
01:02:05,602 --> 01:02:07,852
We just gotta get
this bromance thing back in gear.

1028
01:02:07,853 --> 01:02:10,190
Oh, be careful! Oh, Jesus.

1029
01:02:11,649 --> 01:02:15,361
If you were Doug, where would you be?

1030
01:02:15,361 --> 01:02:17,989
Maybe these guys can
help us find him.

1031
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:22,076
Hey, little buddies.

1032
01:02:22,827 --> 01:02:24,828
How are my favourite
imitation puppets doing?

1033
01:02:24,829 --> 01:02:27,163
- Oh, fuck! My hammie, again!
- Kick his ass!

1034
01:02:27,164 --> 01:02:28,748
Let's fuck him up!

1035
01:02:28,749 --> 01:02:31,878
Wait, wait! I thought you puppets
were the good guys! What the fuck?

1036
01:02:32,003 --> 01:02:33,629
We used to be.

1037
01:02:33,630 --> 01:02:36,508
Yeah, but now we've
stared death in the face.

1038
01:02:36,841 --> 01:02:39,634
We've seen the depths
of human suffering.

1039
01:02:39,635 --> 01:02:42,054
- And we're already dead inside.
- Yeah.

1040
01:02:42,055 --> 01:02:44,347
- That's awful.
- My God, I'm sorry.

1041
01:02:44,348 --> 01:02:47,391
Come on, you bitch!
Yeah, you scared coward!

1042
01:02:47,392 --> 01:02:49,560
You're not man enough
to fuck with me!

1043
01:02:49,561 --> 01:02:52,022
You wouldn't last two minutes
in my world, you bitch!

1044
01:02:52,023 --> 01:02:55,858
- Is that the Mike Tyson rant?
- Fuck you. Fuck you, you ho.

1045
01:02:55,859 --> 01:02:57,616
I'll fuck your ass
in front of everybody!

1046
01:02:57,617 --> 01:02:59,431
Yeah, that's
definitely the Tyson.

1047
01:02:59,697 --> 01:03:01,658
Enough talk! Kill them!

1048
01:03:26,598 --> 01:03:29,227
A mine is a terrible thing to waste.

1049
01:03:30,103 --> 01:03:32,062
That was actually a
pretty good one, Zach.

1050
01:03:32,063 --> 01:03:33,230
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1051
01:03:33,231 --> 01:03:35,232
At least that was
just my reader copy.

1052
01:03:35,233 --> 01:03:37,066
Guys, a little help?

1053
01:03:37,067 --> 01:03:39,821
You four-eyed fuck.
You see this coming?

1054
01:03:43,198 --> 01:03:45,493
Fuck me! Right in the smarts!

1055
01:03:45,909 --> 01:03:47,619
That's painful!

1056
01:03:47,620 --> 01:03:49,122
But also hilarious.

1057
01:03:55,711 --> 01:03:57,463
That's my girl!

1058
01:04:05,930 --> 01:04:07,974
Oh, my God! Oh, my God, you're hurt!

1059
01:04:08,307 --> 01:04:10,642
You should see the other guy.

1060
01:04:10,643 --> 01:04:12,769
- You killed Tonto?
- Yeah.

1061
01:04:12,770 --> 01:04:15,981
Come on, we need to get you
in the shade. Can you walk?

1062
01:04:15,982 --> 01:04:19,277
It's okay, I got you.
I got you, I got you.

1063
01:04:19,776 --> 01:04:21,529
Move! Move!

1064
01:04:21,778 --> 01:04:23,031
It's okay.

1065
01:04:23,573 --> 01:04:25,948
It's all right.
You're gonna be okay.

1066
01:04:25,949 --> 01:04:28,620
It's okay, I got you. I got you.

1067
01:04:28,786 --> 01:04:31,456
I got you. There you go.

1068
01:04:31,956 --> 01:04:35,168
You're gonna be okay.
It's all right, it's not that bad.

1069
01:04:35,292 --> 01:04:37,169
Ed, it's okay.

1070
01:04:37,170 --> 01:04:39,338
No, no, no, it's not okay!
You need help.

1071
01:04:39,339 --> 01:04:42,217
Ed, one of us had to die.

1072
01:04:42,509 --> 01:04:45,220
- Well, I wish it was me.
- Me, too.

1073
01:04:45,595 --> 01:04:47,803
- What?
- Sorry.

1074
01:04:47,804 --> 01:04:50,307
- That slipped out. Sorry.
- Yeah, that came out real fast.

1075
01:04:50,308 --> 01:04:51,976
It's okay.

1076
01:04:52,977 --> 01:04:54,354
Speaking of,

1077
01:04:55,187 --> 01:04:56,523
since...

1078
01:04:56,688 --> 01:05:01,861
Since this is it for me,
do you want to see them?

1079
01:05:02,986 --> 01:05:04,447
See what?

1080
01:05:05,656 --> 01:05:07,867
My boobs, dummy.

1081
01:05:10,036 --> 01:05:11,287
I...

1082
01:05:11,370 --> 01:05:13,915
I would. Very much.

1083
01:05:14,249 --> 01:05:15,542
Okay.

1084
01:05:18,545 --> 01:05:20,588
I know you've been waiting for this.

1085
01:05:30,390 --> 01:05:32,100
Pretty nice, huh?

1086
01:05:32,392 --> 01:05:34,102
Unbelievable.

1087
01:05:35,394 --> 01:05:36,729
Wow.

1088
01:05:37,063 --> 01:05:38,857
No tan lines.

1089
01:05:38,857 --> 01:05:41,150
Unbelievable.

1090
01:05:41,650 --> 01:05:45,238
But if he'd move a little bit,
I could see them better.

1091
01:05:45,572 --> 01:05:47,448
- Ed?
- Yeah, yeah.

1092
01:05:48,991 --> 01:05:52,370
The light is starting to fade.

1093
01:05:54,037 --> 01:05:57,584
Will you look deep into my eyes
as I fade away?

1094
01:05:58,834 --> 01:06:00,795
Absolutely, Katnip.

1095
01:06:07,385 --> 01:06:10,261
- Ed, up here.
- Yeah? I'm sorry. I love them.

1096
01:06:10,262 --> 01:06:12,974
I mean, I love you.
I love all of you.

1097
01:06:14,057 --> 01:06:15,560
I know.

1098
01:06:16,602 --> 01:06:17,937
Goodbye.

1099
01:06:19,397 --> 01:06:20,648
I'll...

1100
01:06:21,857 --> 01:06:24,027
I'll see you soon enough.

1101
01:06:25,819 --> 01:06:27,280
Okay.

1102
01:06:34,244 --> 01:06:35,996
Wait, what's that supposed to mean?

1103
01:06:35,997 --> 01:06:37,205
Katnip?

1104
01:06:37,207 --> 01:06:40,293
Hey, do you know something I don't?
Am I next?

1105
01:06:49,468 --> 01:06:51,220
Yeah, she's dead, that'd be weird.

1106
01:06:51,221 --> 01:06:52,556
That'd be weird. I'm sorry.

1107
01:06:59,437 --> 01:07:02,065
I think it's time we made the call.

1108
01:07:17,955 --> 01:07:19,538
Tracey, it's Bradley.

1109
01:07:19,539 --> 01:07:23,334
I don't know who you
are or what you want.

1110
01:07:23,335 --> 01:07:25,754
Fuck, I think I dialled
the wrong number.

1111
01:07:25,755 --> 01:07:30,051
What I do have are a
particular set of skills.

1112
01:07:30,467 --> 01:07:33,263
If you give my daughter
back to me now,

1113
01:07:33,595 --> 01:07:35,348
that'll be the end of it.

1114
01:07:35,431 --> 01:07:36,931
But if you don't...

1115
01:07:36,932 --> 01:07:39,185
- Okay.
- I will...

1116
01:07:39,185 --> 01:07:40,603
Crazy.

1117
01:07:41,478 --> 01:07:44,232
Definitely not Tracey.
Let me try again.

1118
01:07:50,279 --> 01:07:52,657
- Hello?
- Tracey, it's Bradley.

1119
01:07:53,490 --> 01:07:55,618
Hey, man, what's wrong?

1120
01:07:56,535 --> 01:07:58,327
I don't know.

1121
01:07:58,328 --> 01:08:00,871
The first girl I ever
loved just died.

1122
01:08:00,872 --> 01:08:04,167
I watched you murder a girl
with your bare hands.

1123
01:08:04,169 --> 01:08:05,794
We're as good as dead.

1124
01:08:05,795 --> 01:08:09,339
And the worst part is we
lost our best friend.

1125
01:08:09,340 --> 01:08:11,217
That's what's wrong.

1126
01:08:11,968 --> 01:08:15,511
I can't help but accept some
responsibility for this.

1127
01:08:15,512 --> 01:08:17,972
Yeah, no, I blame you
for the majority of it.

1128
01:08:17,973 --> 01:08:21,684
Seriously?
I mucked up the bachelor party.

1129
01:08:21,685 --> 01:08:24,939
I got us stuck
in some weird alternate universe.

1130
01:08:25,355 --> 01:08:28,151
This whole thing
just went right down the tubes!

1131
01:08:28,234 --> 01:08:31,946
I didn't even get to be a part of
the Human effing Centipede.

1132
01:08:32,906 --> 01:08:34,531
What did you just say?

1133
01:08:34,532 --> 01:08:39,245
I don't care how awkward it is, sharing
a gastric system is a life experience.

1134
01:08:39,245 --> 01:08:41,246
I could have scrapbooked about it.

1135
01:08:41,247 --> 01:08:43,291
No, no, before that.

1136
01:08:43,917 --> 01:08:48,254
This whole thing went down the tubes.

1137
01:08:54,385 --> 01:08:55,637
Doug!

1138
01:08:56,888 --> 01:08:58,765
Are you having a flashback montage?

1139
01:09:00,058 --> 01:09:03,228
The tubes!
I know where Doug is! Bradley!

1140
01:09:03,228 --> 01:09:05,772
- Where are you? What's going on?
- Bradley!

1141
01:09:07,064 --> 01:09:09,065
Bradley? Bradley?

1142
01:09:09,066 --> 01:09:10,443
Bradley? Bradley?

1143
01:09:10,776 --> 01:09:12,402
Hey, Tracey! It's Ed!

1144
01:09:12,403 --> 01:09:16,782
Ed! Ed, what in the H-E-double
hockey sticks is going on?

1145
01:09:16,783 --> 01:09:18,867
We're gonna go pick
up Doug right now,

1146
01:09:18,868 --> 01:09:21,954
so don't you worry
your pretty little man face about it.

1147
01:09:21,955 --> 01:09:23,956
Okay, but we gotta go.
We'll see you real soon, bye!

1148
01:09:23,957 --> 01:09:25,415
What the fuck, man?

1149
01:09:25,416 --> 01:09:27,416
I know where Doug is! Come on! Go!

1150
01:09:27,417 --> 01:09:29,379
Let's go, let's go!

1151
01:09:30,045 --> 01:09:32,632
Hello? Hello?

1152
01:09:35,092 --> 01:09:36,885
This is it! Doug's
tube never came up!

1153
01:09:40,265 --> 01:09:41,641
What?

1154
01:09:41,974 --> 01:09:44,936
Well, if he's not down there,
where the hell is he?

1155
01:09:45,895 --> 01:09:47,938
Okay, let's face it.

1156
01:09:47,939 --> 01:09:49,064
Doug's not in the tube.

1157
01:09:49,065 --> 01:09:52,067
There was no sign of him in the arena.
He is gone.

1158
01:09:52,068 --> 01:09:53,317
That is a fact.

1159
01:09:53,318 --> 01:09:56,239
You fucking idiots!

1160
01:09:59,826 --> 01:10:02,704
- God-fucking-damn it!
- Jesus!

1161
01:10:02,744 --> 01:10:05,331
That bush is angry!

1162
01:10:05,455 --> 01:10:08,457
I'm not "that bush,"
you bearded piece of afterbirth!

1163
01:10:08,458 --> 01:10:09,961
It's me! Doug!

1164
01:10:12,296 --> 01:10:14,841
Shut up! All you guys,
just shut the fuck up!

1165
01:10:15,633 --> 01:10:19,761
You guys forget me all
the fucking time!

1166
01:10:19,762 --> 01:10:22,848
In Vegas!
In this fucked-up alternate universe!

1167
01:10:22,849 --> 01:10:26,143
- Yeah.
- I'm barely in the goddamn movie trailer!

1168
01:10:26,144 --> 01:10:28,645
It's true, I don't even
think he's on the poster.

1169
01:10:28,646 --> 01:10:31,022
I never get any punchlines,

1170
01:10:31,023 --> 01:10:36,235
and you keep leaving me
in enclosed fucking places!

1171
01:10:36,236 --> 01:10:40,115
You think maybe we can talk to you
about this at sea level?

1172
01:10:40,116 --> 01:10:41,784
Not this time.

1173
01:10:43,035 --> 01:10:46,120
This time, I get the last laugh.

1174
01:10:46,121 --> 01:10:48,332
Jeez, dude! Wait, wait, wait!

1175
01:10:48,333 --> 01:10:50,791
You're right! You're right!
We're sorry.

1176
01:10:50,792 --> 01:10:52,877
We haven't given you your proper due.

1177
01:10:52,878 --> 01:10:56,382
You are the perfect blend of
handsome and humourless.

1178
01:10:56,382 --> 01:11:00,136
Without you, there are no jokes.
Hell, without you, there is no us.

1179
01:11:00,345 --> 01:11:02,222
You may be a gay man,

1180
01:11:02,888 --> 01:11:06,559
but you are the best damn
straight man we've ever met.

1181
01:11:12,732 --> 01:11:15,068
I could never murder you guys.

1182
01:11:16,152 --> 01:11:18,613
- You!
- Wait here one second.

1183
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:25,411
You guys!

1184
01:11:25,411 --> 01:11:27,205
That worked great!

1185
01:11:27,580 --> 01:11:30,081
I'm so glad you're alive, man!

1186
01:11:30,082 --> 01:11:31,918
Bradley, bring it in!

1187
01:11:36,005 --> 01:11:38,715
You guys, this is just perfect.

1188
01:11:38,716 --> 01:11:41,553
Nothing could possibly
ruin this moment.

1189
01:11:41,761 --> 01:11:44,221
Hello out there, everybody.

1190
01:11:44,222 --> 01:11:46,597
Hey, remember that earlier

1191
01:11:46,598 --> 01:11:49,184
"bromance revision"
I was telling you guys about?

1192
01:11:49,185 --> 01:11:51,478
Well, you can forget about that.

1193
01:11:51,479 --> 01:11:54,981
There's only gonna be one winner of
the Hungover Games.

1194
01:11:54,982 --> 01:12:00,071
So if you're a foursome of dudes
who recently bro-conciled,

1195
01:12:00,195 --> 01:12:01,947
you're gonna have to kill each other.

1196
01:12:01,948 --> 01:12:03,740
You just have to fight to the death.

1197
01:12:03,741 --> 01:12:06,325
I'm sorry, I don't make up the rules.

1198
01:12:06,326 --> 01:12:08,619
Wait, I do.

1199
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:10,621
I do make up the rules.

1200
01:12:10,622 --> 01:12:12,623
Suckers!

1201
01:12:12,624 --> 01:12:15,383
Well, good luck and may
the odds be forever

1202
01:12:15,384 --> 01:12:18,449
in your blah-blah-blah,
et cetera, et cetera.

1203
01:12:18,797 --> 01:12:20,633
This is gonna be good.

1204
01:12:21,426 --> 01:12:23,428
Nope. No way.

1205
01:13:03,008 --> 01:13:06,095
Wait, why are all these weapons
shaped like dicks?

1206
01:13:07,430 --> 01:13:10,181
All right, listen, guys. Listen up.
Let's talk about this.

1207
01:13:10,182 --> 01:13:12,851
I can't die now.
I'm about to get married.

1208
01:13:12,852 --> 01:13:14,811
I have a wife and kids at home.

1209
01:13:14,812 --> 01:13:17,731
I just lost Katnip!
She was my everything.

1210
01:13:17,732 --> 01:13:20,817
- She was also very much underage.
- Seriously?

1211
01:13:20,818 --> 01:13:22,277
Ed, buddy, there are
laws against that.

1212
01:13:22,278 --> 01:13:24,946
You can't statutory
rape your soulmate.

1213
01:13:24,947 --> 01:13:28,325
Jeepers creepers!
You guys, don't you remember?

1214
01:13:28,326 --> 01:13:29,660
We're a brotherhood!

1215
01:13:29,661 --> 01:13:31,869
You heard the announcement.
It's every man for himself.

1216
01:13:31,870 --> 01:13:34,541
No! I have an idea.

1217
01:13:34,832 --> 01:13:36,541
We all need to eat these.

1218
01:13:36,543 --> 01:13:39,044
They're Midnight Berries.
It's the only way to end this.

1219
01:13:39,045 --> 01:13:41,545
That is what got us into this mess
in the first place.

1220
01:13:41,547 --> 01:13:43,840
Yeah, these berries would kill us.

1221
01:13:43,842 --> 01:13:47,094
But the Capitol
won't even let us swallow them.

1222
01:13:47,095 --> 01:13:50,055
They'd rather have four winners
than no winner.

1223
01:13:50,056 --> 01:13:52,516
So before we even get
these in our mouths

1224
01:13:52,517 --> 01:13:54,351
they'll cancel the whole thing.

1225
01:13:54,352 --> 01:13:56,227
You have to trust me.

1226
01:13:56,228 --> 01:13:57,563
Absolutely not.

1227
01:13:57,564 --> 01:14:03,111
Doubt me all you want, but don't doubt
my knowledge of young adult fiction.

1228
01:14:07,531 --> 01:14:08,739
I'm in.

1229
01:14:08,740 --> 01:14:09,993
What?

1230
01:14:10,576 --> 01:14:11,911
Me, too.

1231
01:14:12,536 --> 01:14:13,913
Really?

1232
01:14:16,583 --> 01:14:18,001
Fine.

1233
01:14:19,252 --> 01:14:20,753
Me, too. I'm in.

1234
01:14:22,797 --> 01:14:24,799
But only because I love you guys.

1235
01:14:25,090 --> 01:14:26,426
Okay.

1236
01:14:27,217 --> 01:14:29,262
On the count of three.

1237
01:14:30,722 --> 01:14:31,973
One.

1238
01:14:31,973 --> 01:14:33,308
_wo.

1239
01:14:33,348 --> 01:14:34,893
Three.

1240
01:14:44,569 --> 01:14:46,571
What do we do now?

1241
01:14:54,787 --> 01:14:56,956
- Come on!
- Kinda tasty.

1242
01:15:02,586 --> 01:15:06,299
Zach, you dumb motherfucker!

1243
01:15:18,435 --> 01:15:20,021
What the...

1244
01:15:20,312 --> 01:15:21,606
Morning.

1245
01:15:21,773 --> 01:15:24,398
- You guys sleep well?
- Yeah.

1246
01:15:24,399 --> 01:15:25,985
Pretty well.

1247
01:15:27,694 --> 01:15:29,656
Anyone have floss?

1248
01:15:29,780 --> 01:15:32,992
I think I've got Midnight Berry seeds
stuck in my teeth.

1249
01:15:33,451 --> 01:15:34,829
Wait, wait. What time is it?

1250
01:15:36,161 --> 01:15:39,332
- It's 10:00 a.m.
- We'll never make the wedding.

1251
01:15:39,832 --> 01:15:41,125
Wanna bet?

1252
01:15:42,794 --> 01:15:46,422
You guys think you can take me out
of the straitjacket now?

1253
01:15:46,630 --> 01:15:49,674
Guys, I am just so pumped to be
a real member of this group.

1254
01:15:49,675 --> 01:15:52,219
It's so cool you're gonna let me
have more lines in the next movie.

1255
01:15:52,220 --> 01:15:53,906
That's right, yeah.
Totally gonna happen.

1256
01:15:53,907 --> 01:15:55,457
Yeah, more lines, definitely.

1257
01:15:58,016 --> 01:16:01,020
Come with me if you want to attend
a gay wedding.

1258
01:16:03,523 --> 01:16:07,026
Sorry. Getting here
was a real bloodbath.

1259
01:16:07,192 --> 01:16:09,903
- What the fucksticks, you guys?
- Honey,

1260
01:16:09,904 --> 01:16:12,281
I am so, so, so sorry.

1261
01:16:12,282 --> 01:16:15,535
You had better
have a good explanation for this.

1262
01:16:15,701 --> 01:16:18,661
Trace, the last three days were,
without a doubt

1263
01:16:18,662 --> 01:16:23,082
the most backwards, fucked up,
inexplicable experience of my entire life.

1264
01:16:23,083 --> 01:16:25,420
I saw brutal death.

1265
01:16:25,753 --> 01:16:29,632
I saw murderous talking puppets.
I saw gay Thor.

1266
01:16:30,592 --> 01:16:32,844
But all I could think about was you.

1267
01:16:34,386 --> 01:16:36,222
Can you forgive me?

1268
01:16:37,472 --> 01:16:38,892
Well,

1269
01:16:41,019 --> 01:16:43,229
boys will be boys.

1270
01:16:47,483 --> 01:16:50,195
So are we gonna talk
about last night?

1271
01:16:50,403 --> 01:16:51,738
Okay.

1272
01:16:52,029 --> 01:16:54,907
Whatever the hell we think happened,
it obviously didn't really happen.

1273
01:16:54,908 --> 01:16:57,743
Zach just got in our heads
with that dumb book of his,

1274
01:16:57,744 --> 01:17:00,538
so just forget about it and move on.

1275
01:17:00,704 --> 01:17:04,459
I'm over it, too.
I'm onto fifty Shades now.

1276
01:17:05,210 --> 01:17:08,129
This rich guy is erotic.

1277
01:17:09,087 --> 01:17:11,340
You know what?
You guys are wrong.

1278
01:17:11,341 --> 01:17:13,425
Over the course of one day,
I loved,

1279
01:17:13,426 --> 01:17:17,094
I lost, and I almost died,
like, 10 times.

1280
01:17:17,095 --> 01:17:18,805
You also ate a boatload of shit.

1281
01:17:18,806 --> 01:17:20,264
Thank you for the reminder.

1282
01:17:20,265 --> 01:17:22,558
But thankfully, it wasn't real.

1283
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:24,102
You gotta let it go, man.

1284
01:17:24,103 --> 01:17:26,771
You know what?
You can believe what you want,

1285
01:17:26,772 --> 01:17:30,193
but I know my connection
with that girl was real.

1286
01:17:31,069 --> 01:17:33,446
There's a lot of wiener in this book.

1287
01:17:33,987 --> 01:17:36,449
But I'm not mad about it.

1288
01:17:36,907 --> 01:17:41,287
This probably would make
a really good TV movie

1289
01:17:43,121 --> 01:17:45,500
if they get Alyssa Milano.

1290
01:17:49,087 --> 01:17:49,747
Sorry.

1291
01:17:49,748 --> 01:17:52,339
So sorry about that.
It's been a bit of a...

1292
01:17:52,340 --> 01:17:53,967
Don't worry about it.

1293
01:17:56,802 --> 01:17:58,471
Wedding's that way.

1294
01:18:00,515 --> 01:18:03,852
Well, it was nice bumping into you.

1295
01:18:09,147 --> 01:18:10,525
Hey, bud.

1296
01:18:11,109 --> 01:18:12,400
We gotta go.

1297
01:18:12,401 --> 01:18:14,195
- Ed.
- Do you...

1298
01:18:14,570 --> 01:18:16,739
What are you stammering about?

1299
01:18:16,822 --> 01:18:20,785
We are gathered here today
to celebrate the pure

1300
01:18:21,244 --> 01:18:23,245
and magical love of

1301
01:18:23,246 --> 01:18:27,292
these two deeply,
deeply passionate men.

1302
01:18:27,625 --> 01:18:31,003
Guys, that's her.
I swear to God, she's right there.

1303
01:18:31,004 --> 01:18:32,629
Stop, man. There is no her.

1304
01:18:32,630 --> 01:18:34,589
- Yeah...
- Do I need to set you up with a shrink?

1305
01:18:34,590 --> 01:18:36,800
- I'm telling you, she's...
- Dude.

1306
01:18:36,801 --> 01:18:38,344
- Enough.
- Fine.

1307
01:18:38,552 --> 01:18:40,180
Letting it go.

1308
01:18:40,263 --> 01:18:42,182
- Thank you.
- Some people say

1309
01:18:43,016 --> 01:18:45,185
love is nothing but a battlefield.

1310
01:18:45,602 --> 01:18:47,020
Not me.

1311
01:18:47,144 --> 01:18:50,938
These days, people don't view
marriage as something to enjoy.

1312
01:18:50,939 --> 01:18:54,317
They view it as something to survive.

1313
01:18:54,318 --> 01:18:56,987
So Doug, Tracey,

1314
01:18:56,988 --> 01:18:58,989
with that, I say

1315
01:18:58,990 --> 01:19:03,745
may the odds be ever in your favour.

1316
01:25:01,351 --> 01:25:03,563
This tree has a vagina.
