1
00:00:04,172 --> 00:00:06,174
(glass breaking)

2
00:00:15,149 --> 00:00:18,486
(sound of train passing by)

3
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:51,819
- [Voiceover] That wraps
up the first edition

4
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:53,754
of the Pittsburgh Pulse.

5
00:00:53,854 --> 00:00:56,090
Our thanks to Democratic
Congressman Mark Allen

6
00:00:56,124 --> 00:00:59,059
and Alyssa Denolfo of the
Penn Conservative League

7
00:00:59,093 --> 00:01:00,461
for joining us today.

8
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:02,029
- [Voiceover] We hope you'll
join us every Saturday

9
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:05,399
as we look at the day's
top issues from all sides.

10
00:01:05,433 --> 00:01:08,236
Even McCormack's whacked
out lefty perspective.

11
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:09,170
[McCormack] That's right.

12
00:01:09,203 --> 00:01:10,771
And Mike will continue his quest

13
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:13,241
to make Bill O'Reilly
look progressive.

14
00:01:13,274 --> 00:01:16,144
We've got shows coming
up on Wall Street Reform,

15
00:01:16,177 --> 00:01:19,380
calls for national energy
policy, and the drive for

16
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:22,082
marriage equality in
the Keystone State.

17
00:01:22,116 --> 00:01:23,717
Mike loves that one.

18
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:25,819
[Mike] Say I don't Pennsylvania.

19
00:01:25,853 --> 00:01:27,655
And of course you can
follow our columns

20
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:30,324
Tuesdays and Thursdays
in the Times Herald.

21
00:01:30,358 --> 00:01:32,326
Until next time
I'm Mike Steinman.

22
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,027
[McCormack] And
I'm Colin McCormack

23
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:35,629
on The Pulse.

24
00:01:37,298 --> 00:01:38,932
Who's your daddy?

25
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:40,368
(laughter)

26
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:43,704
- Okay okay, so this year
turned out pretty good.

27
00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:45,005
Mike, Colin, nice work.

28
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:45,906
- Yes

29
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,341
(cheering)

30
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:50,010
- Okay, it's enough.

31
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:51,212
Enough.

32
00:01:51,245 --> 00:01:52,880
I don't need their
egos any bigger.

33
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:56,016
Now, maybe ya heard this.

34
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:59,153
Print is dead.

35
00:01:59,187 --> 00:02:00,788
How 'bout them apples?

36
00:02:00,821 --> 00:02:02,256
Christ.

37
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:06,960
So, corporate is hot for
the potential synergy here.

38
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:09,597
I swear to God if I never
say that word again.

39
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,533
Anyways, since you've
seen the commercials

40
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:13,567
tomorrow at noon.

41
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:15,169
So keep spreading the word.

42
00:02:15,203 --> 00:02:17,405
(indistinguishable) my office.

43
00:02:18,206 --> 00:02:21,275
The rest of you clowns,
enjoy the weekend.

44
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,885
- Amber, did you get
those Medicare stats?

45
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:06,420
(Amber talking into phone)

46
00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:12,726
- Okay, Amber is
a stripper name.

47
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,528
And you can't hire someone
with a stripper name

48
00:03:14,562 --> 00:03:15,929
to produce a news show.

49
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:18,131
- Yeah, tell that to Steinman.

50
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:20,868
Listen, did I see interns?

51
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:21,635
- Yeah.

52
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:22,403
Started yesterday.

53
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:23,704
- Can I borrow one?

54
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:25,138
I've got a little
research project

55
00:03:25,172 --> 00:03:27,741
and I swear Amber just
goes to Wikipedia.

56
00:03:27,775 --> 00:03:29,076
(both chuckling)

57
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:30,177
- Monday okay?

58
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,178
- Perfect.

59
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:31,979
Heading out.

60
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:33,213
Gotta get to the gym.

61
00:03:33,247 --> 00:03:34,448
- Or you can just give
in to middle age spread

62
00:03:34,482 --> 00:03:35,516
like the rest of us.

63
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:36,850
- Maybe I will.

64
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:38,319
When I'm middle aged.

65
00:03:38,352 --> 00:03:39,152
(slap on butt)

66
00:03:39,186 --> 00:03:39,787
- Oh!

67
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:43,624
(rock music)

68
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:16,156
* And I fucked up

69
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:18,392
* yet again

70
00:04:19,293 --> 00:04:20,961
* A long

71
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:23,564
* a long way

72
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:26,500
(imitating drum solo)

73
00:04:27,735 --> 00:04:30,203
(indistinct singing)

74
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:33,307
* It don't matter

75
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:35,876
- [TV announcer] Six
unanswered points.

76
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:37,277
- Shit!

77
00:04:37,311 --> 00:04:38,211
- [TV announcer] Panthers
can't afford this kind

78
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:39,713
of deficit in the early going.

79
00:04:39,747 --> 00:04:41,549
Stamina's a big question--

80
00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:42,983
(phone ringing)

81
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:47,054
- Well, there you are.

82
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:50,858
Why is it celebrities
are never on time?

83
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:54,194
Seriously, you and Madonna
always keep me waiting.

84
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:55,796
- [Colin] It's in the handbook.

85
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:57,030
- How was the screening?

86
00:04:57,064 --> 00:04:59,933
- [Colin] It turned out great.

87
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:03,236
Kind of weird to see
myself on TV though.

88
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,438
- [Other man] Oh right.

89
00:05:04,472 --> 00:05:05,739
You know you can't
wait to be besieged

90
00:05:05,773 --> 00:05:07,240
by adoring fans.

91
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:09,443
- Got my first one today.

92
00:05:09,477 --> 00:05:12,145
Caught one of the
interns checking me out.

93
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:13,647
Kind of cute too.

94
00:05:13,681 --> 00:05:14,782
- [Other man] Colin.

95
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:15,949
- [Colin] Oh relax.

96
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:17,818
I like em young but
there are limits.

97
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:19,052
- [Other man] Do we need
to have a little talk

98
00:05:19,086 --> 00:05:20,153
about sexual harassment?

99
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:21,989
You know, it's
generally frowned upon.

100
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:23,023
- [Colin] Shut it.

101
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:23,924
The game's started.

102
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:25,158
They're getting hammered.

103
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:26,460
(door closing)

104
00:05:27,094 --> 00:05:27,728
Yo.

105
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:29,329
Oh, come on!

106
00:05:29,363 --> 00:05:30,598
Where's the defense?!

107
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:31,665
- [Other man] What?

108
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:32,733
Is it getting worse?

109
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:34,435
(TV announcer talking)

110
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:36,437
- Down 12 already, Jesus.

111
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,571
- Hey.

112
00:05:37,605 --> 00:05:39,640
Welcome back.

113
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:40,841
- [Other man] Please.

114
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:43,877
I don't know that
one journal article

115
00:05:43,911 --> 00:05:45,713
counts as a career renaissance.

116
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:48,482
- Always on the
bright side with you.

117
00:05:48,516 --> 00:05:50,484
- Yeah, that's
part of the charm.

118
00:05:50,518 --> 00:05:51,419
- Oh!

119
00:05:51,452 --> 00:05:52,886
Come on.

120
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,287
- Harper is throwing bricks.

121
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:55,623
They need to sit him now.

122
00:05:55,656 --> 00:05:56,424
Buh bye.

123
00:05:56,457 --> 00:05:57,791
- Easy Prince Charming.

124
00:05:57,825 --> 00:05:59,893
Get your food
before it ices over.

125
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:04,798
- Ah see.

126
00:06:04,832 --> 00:06:05,833
I should coach.

127
00:06:06,634 --> 00:06:08,235
- You're a genius.

128
00:06:09,537 --> 00:06:10,804
Hey...

129
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:12,873
We should go out tonight.

130
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:14,442
After the game.

131
00:06:14,475 --> 00:06:16,076
We should celebrate.

132
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:16,910
- Nah.

133
00:06:16,944 --> 00:06:18,111
- Stewart.

134
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:20,347
When was the last
time you got some?

135
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:21,949
- Let's see.

136
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:24,151
Truman was president so--

137
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:24,918
(Colin laughing)

138
00:06:24,952 --> 00:06:25,886
No, wait.

139
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,788
Eisenhower, so see I'm good.
You have fun.

140
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:29,022
- Oh...

141
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:30,223
I will.

142
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:35,262
(loud club music)

143
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:51,779
- Mom.

144
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:53,647
Mom I can't--

145
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:56,116
You're slurring.

146
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:57,117
I can't understand you.

147
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,151
He said what?

148
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:00,120
What did he--

149
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:04,257
I'm sure he didn't mean that.

150
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:06,560
I said I'm su--

151
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,398
Why don't you just
call me tomor--

152
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:13,567
No.

153
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:14,835
No.

154
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:15,669
I don't want to talk to him.

155
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:16,804
Mom, no--

156
00:07:17,805 --> 00:07:18,839
Fuck!

157
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:23,877
Hi dad.

158
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,147
Yes sir, I can tell.

159
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:29,449
Just tell her I'll--

160
00:07:31,485 --> 00:07:32,385
Dad.

161
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:35,823
Are you there?

162
00:07:36,724 --> 00:07:37,491
(raunchy rock music)

163
00:07:37,525 --> 00:07:39,593
* Down in the hole

164
00:07:41,428 --> 00:07:43,296
* Worn and faded

165
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,398
* Torn and jaded

166
00:07:45,432 --> 00:07:47,635
* Thrown away

167
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:53,040
* Overrated, understated

168
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:08,488
- Yo.

169
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:10,758
Are we two or three?

170
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:12,926
- Kicked him out.

171
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:14,528
- [Stewart] Oh
good, I'm starving.

172
00:08:14,562 --> 00:08:16,396
I let you have an extra hour.

173
00:08:16,664 --> 00:08:17,931
(cell phone ringing)

174
00:08:18,265 --> 00:08:19,432
- Hey, dad.

175
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:20,267
What's up?

176
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,134
- Hey Tom.

177
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:22,870
You see--

178
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:27,675
Oh, fuck!

179
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:30,177
(Collin mumbling in agreement)

180
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:31,178
(alarm beeping)

181
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:32,780
- Collin, your show.

182
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:34,281
Is it on DVR?

183
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:44,892
- Alex died.

184
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,060
- Your uncle Liam's Alex?

185
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:48,862
- Massive stroke last night.

186
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,031
- Oh my God.

187
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:52,866
- Liam's devastated.

188
00:08:53,801 --> 00:08:55,002
So...

189
00:08:56,704 --> 00:08:58,305
We're gonna go out
to L.A. just to...

190
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,540
Be with them.

191
00:09:00,574 --> 00:09:01,575
Help with all the arrangements.

192
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,712
- You want me to go with?

193
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:07,180
- Yeah.

194
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,751
Dad would really
appreciate that.

195
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:12,252
Liam too.

196
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:34,241
- [Voiceover] I feel like
I was blessed to have him.

197
00:09:34,842 --> 00:09:36,176
And ah...

198
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,279
Now I feel blessed again because

199
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:41,048
you're all here with me.

200
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:42,482
To celebrate his life.

201
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:46,253
My big brother Tom.

202
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:48,756
Thank you Tommy.

203
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:51,925
For giving me away when Alex

204
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:54,227
finally could make
an honest man of me.

205
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:55,395
(chuckling)

206
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,134
And our precious...

207
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:03,804
Precious friends.

208
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:08,709
You know, Alex's family...

209
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,145
They never accepted who he was.

210
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:17,785
And that hurt him more
than you can imagine.

211
00:10:18,786 --> 00:10:20,087
But you...

212
00:10:20,754 --> 00:10:21,922
All of you,

213
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:26,760
you were his family.

214
00:10:42,743 --> 00:10:43,977
- [Stewart] It's very
nice to meet you.

215
00:10:44,712 --> 00:10:46,113
- I want you to think about it.

216
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:46,780
- I will.

217
00:10:46,814 --> 00:10:48,148
I promise.

218
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,385
Search Committee at UCLA.

219
00:10:52,786 --> 00:10:53,954
I know, crazy right?

220
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:55,655
- You boys, don't
miss your plane.

221
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:57,324
- Love you dad.

222
00:10:57,357 --> 00:10:58,759
- Love you son.

223
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,061
Stu, thanks for coming out.

224
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:01,962
- Of course.

225
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,130
- Appreciate it.

226
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:03,864
- You look very
handsome Stewart.

227
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:05,032
- Thanks Mrs. M.

228
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:06,299
- They're gonna
miss their plane.

229
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,400
- Go go go go.

230
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:08,902
(indistinct chatter)

231
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:13,173
- After 50 years.

232
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,476
Have we missed out?

233
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:19,079
- That's a dangerous question.

234
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,480
What color's the car?

235
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,648
(car beeping)
- I mean growing up I wanted

236
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,116
to be just like
my dad, you know?

237
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,753
Devoted wife, couple of kids.

238
00:11:26,253 --> 00:11:28,355
But when I realized I
was gay I guess I thought

239
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:30,991
a family just
wasn't in the cards.

240
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:32,525
- Please, you're not
the marrying kind.

241
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,027
You're more of a...

242
00:11:34,061 --> 00:11:34,962
Slut.

243
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:36,629
- Shut it.

244
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:37,630
(chuckling)

245
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:39,466
I mean, yeah but...

246
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:41,601
- And don't forget all the spunk

247
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:42,970
you sold for beer money at Yale.

248
00:11:43,003 --> 00:11:43,871
(squirting sound)

249
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:44,805
Check it off.

250
00:11:45,005 --> 00:11:45,773
- Stewart.

251
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:47,540
Jesus, you're not...

252
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:49,076
- What?

253
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:52,112
- You make it
impossible sometimes.

254
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:54,547
- Are we talking
actual feelings here?

255
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:55,482
Do we do that?

256
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:56,817
- Not if you can help it?

257
00:11:57,951 --> 00:11:59,319
- Okay, I'm listening.

258
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:08,128
- Mmm, who's your daddy?

259
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,367
Just give me the keys.

260
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:19,372
(car beeping)

261
00:12:24,377 --> 00:12:25,712
- [Voiceover] I'll
tell you why Pat.

262
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,580
The bible very clearly tells us

263
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:30,117
that marriage is between
a man and a woman

264
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,985
and it is a sacred covenant.

265
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:34,221
The bible also very
clearly tells us

266
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,890
that homosexuality
is an abomination.

267
00:12:36,924 --> 00:12:38,058
And that is the word.

268
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:39,526
Abomination.
- Knock knock.

269
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,694
- [Voiceover] To claim that
homosexuals should be allowed--

270
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:42,629
- What the fuck?

271
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:44,131
- The Reverend Irvin Lockwood.

272
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:45,732
Amber booked him for the show

273
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,100
on marriage equality.

274
00:12:47,134 --> 00:12:48,068
- Of course she did.

275
00:12:48,668 --> 00:12:50,370
I come bearing intern.

276
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:56,643
Why are you lurking like that?

277
00:12:56,676 --> 00:12:57,978
Come on in here.

278
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:01,781
Come on.

279
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:03,083
He's not gonna bite.

280
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:06,119
Colin McCormack, Thaddeus Bloom.

281
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:07,254
- It's Tee.

282
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:08,321
Goes by Tee.

283
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:09,689
- [Colin] Nice to meet you, Tee.

284
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,291
Shar showed me your samples.

285
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:13,793
Some of the strongest student
writing I've ever read.

286
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:14,461
- Really?

287
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:15,395
You liked it?

288
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:17,097
That's, wow.

289
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,933
- Okay, this one won't
stop talking about you.

290
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:21,101
Colin this, Colin that.

291
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,802
You'd think you
were Justin Beaver.

292
00:13:22,836 --> 00:13:25,672
- Uh, it's Bieber, Shar.

293
00:13:25,705 --> 00:13:27,240
Not Beaver.

294
00:13:27,274 --> 00:13:28,608
- Whatevs.

295
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:29,609
Figured you know.

296
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,677
(chuckling)

297
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:31,444
- All right.

298
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:32,479
My shit comes first.

299
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:33,146
Capisce?

300
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:33,981
- Yes ma'am.

301
00:13:34,014 --> 00:13:35,415
- (chuckles) Ma'am.

302
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:36,950
Can you fucking believe this?

303
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:37,918
(chuckles)

304
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:42,455
- Okay.

305
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:45,758
So, are you familiar with
Reverend Irvin Lockwood?

306
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:46,960
- Yes, sir.

307
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:47,760
Pops made me watch
him every Sunday.

308
00:13:47,794 --> 00:13:49,262
- Oh, you're not a...

309
00:13:49,296 --> 00:13:50,563
- No sir.

310
00:13:50,597 --> 00:13:53,200
The Reverend is not too
fond of us homosexuals.

311
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:55,302
I kind of hate him.

312
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:58,305
- Well, we need to
stay objective here.

313
00:13:58,338 --> 00:13:59,506
But,

314
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:01,008
there are rumors.

315
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:01,942
I'm sure you've heard.

316
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:02,910
- The mistress?

317
00:14:02,943 --> 00:14:04,111
- The mistress.

318
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:05,478
- That's the devil's
tongue talking.

319
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:06,679
- So he says.

320
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:09,616
No one's been able
to connect the dots.

321
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:12,485
But I thought if we
gathered all various sources

322
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,121
that do exist.

323
00:14:14,154 --> 00:14:16,023
- We can see all
the dots he wants?

324
00:14:16,056 --> 00:14:17,390
- Right.

325
00:14:17,424 --> 00:14:19,426
This guys calls himself
a defender of marriage.

326
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:21,394
If he's screwing around...

327
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:22,595
I wanna nail him on it.

328
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:24,297
We have a month.

329
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:25,498
See what you can find.

330
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:26,399
- Yes sir.

331
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:28,268
- Tee, um...

332
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,670
This whole sir thing,

333
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:31,804
it's killing me.

334
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:33,573
Just Colin please.

335
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:34,407
- Yes sir--

336
00:14:34,975 --> 00:14:36,109
Colin.

337
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:54,427
- [Stewart] Holy
crap, traffic was--

338
00:14:54,461 --> 00:14:55,996
Oh, uh...

339
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:57,130
- You're looking for Colin?

340
00:14:57,164 --> 00:14:58,731
He's in Ms. Miyake's office.

341
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:01,001
- Thanks.

342
00:15:04,938 --> 00:15:07,340
- I still think you're
too ugly for TV.

343
00:15:07,374 --> 00:15:09,209
- And the makeup helps.

344
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:11,578
You're still wearing
it, you know.

345
00:15:11,611 --> 00:15:13,080
- It kind of makes
me feel pretty.

346
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:16,116
- Great show guys.

347
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:16,783
- [Mike] Hey.

348
00:15:16,816 --> 00:15:17,784
- Good night.

349
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,286
- Uh, Medicare?

350
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:20,220
- Oh sorry.

351
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:21,454
I didn't get to it.

352
00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:25,425
- [Colin] Admit it
Mike, you hired her

353
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:26,693
for her tits.

354
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:29,997
- McCormack please,
there's a lady present.

355
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:30,763
- Fuck that.

356
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:31,764
Answer the question.

357
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:33,033
(chuckling)

358
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:34,334
(door knocking)

359
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:35,068
Hey Stu.

360
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:36,303
- Hey Shar.

361
00:15:36,336 --> 00:15:37,604
Michael.

362
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:38,871
- Stu man.

363
00:15:39,506 --> 00:15:41,174
- Game starts in 20 and
I don't wanna have to

364
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:42,209
chase people from our seats.

365
00:15:42,242 --> 00:15:43,110
Did you get my message?

366
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:43,743
- Oh.

367
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:44,944
Shit.

368
00:15:44,978 --> 00:15:45,712
We were taping so I
turned off my phone.

369
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:47,314
- All right ladies.

370
00:15:47,347 --> 00:15:49,149
Better go wash this makeup off

371
00:15:49,182 --> 00:15:52,052
so the wife doesn't think
McCormack's giving me the gay.

372
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:54,787
(Mike taunting)

373
00:15:58,425 --> 00:16:00,160
- Do you guys even
read his columns?

374
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:01,528
(chuckling)

375
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:04,464
- So, who was that
in your office?

376
00:16:04,497 --> 00:16:05,598
- Tee, short for Thaddeus.

377
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:06,533
He's an intern.

378
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:07,800
What's this about, an interview?

379
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:09,236
- UCLA.

380
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:10,570
They're flying me out
for some meetings.

381
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:11,471
I have one next week.

382
00:16:13,073 --> 00:16:14,674
- So you applied.

383
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:17,677
- Well, it seemed
like such a long shot.

384
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,379
You don't think I should?

385
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:20,147
- Huh?

386
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,181
Oh no, It's just...

387
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,684
I mean they're a
big deal, right?

388
00:16:25,785 --> 00:16:28,455
I thought you were over
high pressure academia.

389
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:29,822
- I don't know.

390
00:16:29,856 --> 00:16:31,358
Fifteen years?

391
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:32,925
Maybe I can handle
the political bullshit

392
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:33,926
now that I'm older.

393
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:36,296
- Yeah but...

394
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:38,398
You're happy here, right?

395
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:46,939
Avoiding the question?

396
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:49,709
- Perpetually.

397
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:57,250
(melancholic music)

398
00:17:15,168 --> 00:17:16,336
- [Colin] How do you fix that?

399
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:19,038
I've had three different
IT guys in here.

400
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:21,274
- McCormack, I gotta
bail on the game.

401
00:17:21,308 --> 00:17:22,809
Little Mike's been
puking all day

402
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:24,344
and the wife's in a mood.

403
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:25,278
- Is he all right?

404
00:17:25,312 --> 00:17:26,079
- Yeah, he's fine.

405
00:17:26,113 --> 00:17:26,746
He's a kid.

406
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:27,380
He eats bugs.

407
00:17:27,414 --> 00:17:28,181
You know.

408
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:32,885
- Did you eat bugs?

409
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:34,154
- I don't think so.

410
00:17:34,187 --> 00:17:35,255
- Me either.

411
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:36,589
(chuckling)

412
00:17:37,424 --> 00:17:38,791
Hey.

413
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:41,628
Any interest in catching
a basketball game?

414
00:17:48,335 --> 00:17:52,105
I still can't believe you
spent two years at UNC

415
00:17:52,139 --> 00:17:54,707
and never went to a single game.

416
00:17:55,342 --> 00:17:56,209
Here, let me--

417
00:17:56,243 --> 00:17:57,377
- What?

418
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,445
- It still has the
stickers on it.

419
00:17:58,478 --> 00:17:59,646
- That's hip hop man.

420
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,047
- Leaving he stickers on?

421
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,349
That's ridiculous.

422
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:04,417
Well at least brake
in the brim a little.

423
00:18:04,451 --> 00:18:05,552
- Nuh uh, it's my hat.

424
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:07,019
- I paid for it.

425
00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:08,221
(phone ringing)

426
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:09,289
Yo.

427
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:10,757
This isn't over.

428
00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:16,896
So how's it going?

429
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,098
- [Stewart] Holy crap.

430
00:18:19,132 --> 00:18:20,233
- That bad huh?

431
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:21,401
- No no no no.

432
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:22,202
That good.

433
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:23,270
They love me.

434
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:25,538
- Really?

435
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:27,407
- Well you don't have
to sound so surprised.

436
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,142
- [Colin] I'm not.

437
00:18:29,176 --> 00:18:29,942
- [Stewart] I know, I know.

438
00:18:29,976 --> 00:18:31,178
It's just the first day.

439
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:32,345
But I had this great
meeting with the dean.

440
00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:35,448
He has read all my
stuff which was surreal.

441
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:37,584
- That's great.

442
00:18:37,884 --> 00:18:39,219
- [Stewart] Right?

443
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:40,453
And then, this afternoon
I'm just touring the campus

444
00:18:40,487 --> 00:18:42,422
and I get hit by this
cute professor from

445
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:43,790
the history department--

446
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:46,259
Maybe the universe is
trying to tell me something.

447
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:49,396
- Did you just say the universe?

448
00:18:50,163 --> 00:18:51,398
- Oh God.

449
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:52,965
One day and I'm already
talking like them.

450
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:56,636
- Mention kale and I'm
sending out a rescue party.

451
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:58,137
- [Stewart] Please
send the hit squad.

452
00:18:58,171 --> 00:19:01,408
Now listen, I'm meeting
history department for a drink.

453
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:04,311
Um, I gotta go.

454
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:05,845
Tomorrow is meetings,
meetings, meetings.

455
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:07,013
And then some big dinner thing.

456
00:19:07,046 --> 00:19:08,114
But I'll call when I can.

457
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:09,949
- Oh, okay.

458
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:10,583
Talk to you then.

459
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:11,618
Glad it's--

460
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,125
- Something wrong?

461
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:19,926
- Hmm?

462
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:21,761
Oh, no no, just...

463
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,164
(exhales heavily)

464
00:19:25,432 --> 00:19:26,366
Stu.

465
00:19:29,236 --> 00:19:30,169
Another round?

466
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:31,438
(laughing)

467
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:32,305
- Sure.

468
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,752
(train honking)

469
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,156
- [Tee] A half an hour
north of Ashville.

470
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,458
Near the Tennessee line.

471
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:52,492
- Sounds rustic.

472
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:53,860
- Yeah.

473
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:55,395
- You know, I grew up
right here, Carnegie Mellon

474
00:19:55,428 --> 00:19:56,162
faculty brat.

475
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:56,963
- Yeah, I know.

476
00:19:56,996 --> 00:19:58,565
I think some of the--

477
00:19:58,598 --> 00:20:00,066
- Look at that ball control!

478
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:01,401
Come on.

479
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:04,271
How can you not love basketball?

480
00:20:04,304 --> 00:20:06,706
- Why, because I'm black?

481
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,510
- Shut it, jackass.

482
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:12,712
Because you're from
North Carolina.

483
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:16,549
Dean Smith, Coach K,
Michael fuckin' Jordan?

484
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,585
- Pops wasn't too big
on extracurriculars.

485
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:20,453
Took too much time
out of bible study.

486
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:23,656
- Wait, seriously?

487
00:20:24,491 --> 00:20:25,425
- Yes sir.

488
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,327
- Stop that.

489
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:31,531
Wow, so your dad's...

490
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:33,466
pretty religious.

491
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,703
- Um, I was raised
by my grandparents.

492
00:20:36,803 --> 00:20:39,205
But, yeah, Pentecostal.

493
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:40,307
- [Colin] Yeesh.

494
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,541
- No snakes or nothing.

495
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:42,609
People always ask
about that but...

496
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,911
it's still pretty hardcore.

497
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,548
- Are your parents...

498
00:20:49,015 --> 00:20:51,083
- Yeah, in a car wreck.

499
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:52,051
I was three.

500
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,252
I don't remember anything.

501
00:20:53,286 --> 00:20:54,621
- [Colin] I'm sorry.

502
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:59,359
So, does your grandfather

503
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:00,760
know you're gay?

504
00:21:00,793 --> 00:21:02,695
- Oh, yeah.

505
00:21:02,729 --> 00:21:04,797
He caught me and my best friend,

506
00:21:04,831 --> 00:21:06,198
you know.

507
00:21:06,232 --> 00:21:08,468
- Oh shit.

508
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:09,802
(laughing)

509
00:21:09,836 --> 00:21:11,771
- He used to pray over me.

510
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:13,340
Like a lot.

511
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:15,908
Out saying, "Leave this boy."

512
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:18,478
It's pretty intense.

513
00:21:19,178 --> 00:21:21,348
I told him I was
healed once but...

514
00:21:21,381 --> 00:21:22,782
Then he caught us again.

515
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:25,385
(laughing)

516
00:21:25,485 --> 00:21:26,653
- Sorry to laugh.

517
00:21:26,686 --> 00:21:27,954
I'm sorry.

518
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:36,629
- [Tee] Program's great
but, I just transferred.

519
00:21:36,663 --> 00:21:38,898
I'm gay, I'm black.

520
00:21:38,931 --> 00:21:40,367
I talk different.

521
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,635
- That's gotta be tough.

522
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:44,904
- No, everyone's
super nice, just...

523
00:21:44,937 --> 00:21:46,373
I don't know,
sometimes I feel like

524
00:21:46,406 --> 00:21:48,307
I'm a pet alien or something.

525
00:21:48,341 --> 00:21:51,511
- Phone home.

526
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,380
- What?

527
00:21:55,081 --> 00:21:56,683
Pet alien like E.T..

528
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,751
- Oh, like the movie.

529
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:01,153
I've never really seen it.

530
00:22:01,187 --> 00:22:01,888
We didn't.

531
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:03,155
- Come on.

532
00:22:03,189 --> 00:22:04,991
With Elliott and E.T.
and what's her name--

533
00:22:05,024 --> 00:22:06,192
Drew Barrymore?

534
00:22:06,225 --> 00:22:07,860
The bicycle chase and
they start flying?

535
00:22:07,894 --> 00:22:08,628
No?

536
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:10,096
- It sounds cool.

537
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:11,864
It's from the 80s right?

538
00:22:12,632 --> 00:22:13,766
- Oh shit.

539
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,234
Never mind.

540
00:22:15,435 --> 00:22:16,469
Ouch.

541
00:22:17,904 --> 00:22:20,006
So you feel like an alien.

542
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,874
But do you think your
classmates really

543
00:22:21,908 --> 00:22:23,543
view you that way?

544
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:24,310
Or is that--

545
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,412
Oh.

546
00:22:25,445 --> 00:22:26,713
I'm sorry.

547
00:22:26,746 --> 00:22:27,614
- What?

548
00:22:27,647 --> 00:22:29,281
- I don't mean to grill you.

549
00:22:29,315 --> 00:22:30,450
Hazard of the job.

550
00:22:30,483 --> 00:22:32,118
Every conversation
is an interview.

551
00:22:32,151 --> 00:22:33,285
You'll see.

552
00:22:34,387 --> 00:22:36,322
- What's your favorite color?

553
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,657
- My...

554
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,660
- I'm practicing my
interview skills.

555
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:41,961
Favorite color?

556
00:22:41,994 --> 00:22:43,996
- [Colin] That's your
opening question?

557
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:44,997
Favorite color?

558
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:45,798
(both chuckling)

559
00:22:45,832 --> 00:22:47,567
Wow, I smell a Pulitzer.

560
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,968
- Favorite color?

561
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:50,169
- Blue.

562
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,572
- Cats or dogs?

563
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:53,606
- Neither.

564
00:22:54,273 --> 00:22:55,808
Not that I don't like them.

565
00:22:55,842 --> 00:22:57,076
I just can't be around them.

566
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:58,010
Allergic.

567
00:22:58,044 --> 00:22:58,978
- Me too.

568
00:22:59,011 --> 00:22:59,912
Like my eyes start swelling up

569
00:22:59,946 --> 00:23:01,481
and I can't stop sneezing.

570
00:23:01,514 --> 00:23:02,782
- Exactly.

571
00:23:03,783 --> 00:23:06,285
Um, hang on.

572
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:07,319
I gotta...

573
00:23:18,865 --> 00:23:20,733
(urinating)

574
00:23:21,634 --> 00:23:23,135
(laughing)

575
00:23:32,445 --> 00:23:35,247
Sorry about that.

576
00:23:39,185 --> 00:23:41,353
I've enjoyed hanging
out with you.

577
00:23:41,387 --> 00:23:43,590
Thaddeus Bloom.

578
00:23:44,056 --> 00:23:45,492
- Yeah, me too.

579
00:23:57,403 --> 00:23:58,237
- Oh.

580
00:23:59,338 --> 00:24:00,907
Shit.

581
00:24:03,576 --> 00:24:04,577
Did I?

582
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:05,978
- No it's--

583
00:24:06,012 --> 00:24:07,079
- Oh...

584
00:24:07,246 --> 00:24:08,481
Shit!

585
00:24:08,515 --> 00:24:10,517
What the fuck am I doing?

586
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:11,450
- Colin it's okay.

587
00:24:11,484 --> 00:24:12,619
- No fuck!
Don't!

588
00:24:12,652 --> 00:24:13,419
Oh fuck!

589
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:14,521
What is wrong with me?

590
00:24:14,554 --> 00:24:15,922
- Colin?
- No.

591
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:17,156
Listen.

592
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:18,257
Tee, this is my fault.

593
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,025
I'm sorry.

594
00:24:19,058 --> 00:24:19,992
You're an intern.

595
00:24:20,026 --> 00:24:21,193
- It's okay.
- No!

596
00:24:21,227 --> 00:24:21,961
Tee, it's not.

597
00:24:21,994 --> 00:24:23,162
You should go.

598
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:23,796
- What?

599
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:24,597
- Just go!

600
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:25,765
Forget Lockwood.
We shouldn't be--

601
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:26,465
Oh fuck!

602
00:24:26,499 --> 00:24:27,800
- I--
- No!

603
00:24:27,834 --> 00:24:28,568
Just stay away from me.

604
00:24:28,601 --> 00:24:29,335
I mean it!

605
00:24:29,368 --> 00:24:30,169
Stay away!

606
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:33,039
(train bell chiming)

607
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:49,589
(zipper unzipping)

608
00:25:13,546 --> 00:25:18,317
(low suspenseful music)

609
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:41,641
- Hey.

610
00:25:42,842 --> 00:25:44,043
- [Tee] Hey.

611
00:25:45,978 --> 00:25:48,047
I couldn't figure
out the coffee maker.

612
00:25:50,817 --> 00:25:52,451
- It took me a week.

613
00:25:53,352 --> 00:25:55,221
The manual's like War and Peace.

614
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:58,057
Did you shower?

615
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:59,792
- Nah, I have to change
before work anyway.

616
00:26:00,092 --> 00:26:01,527
I shower at the dorm.

617
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:03,730
- Dorm.

618
00:26:04,664 --> 00:26:05,765
Oh Christ.

619
00:26:07,266 --> 00:26:08,735
Tee, um.

620
00:26:10,102 --> 00:26:11,237
Listen, uh.

621
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:14,240
Last night...

622
00:26:16,843 --> 00:26:18,077
I think this might be--

623
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,912
- Your place is really cool.

624
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,615
- Oh.

625
00:26:23,115 --> 00:26:24,250
Yeah.

626
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:26,385
Thanks.

627
00:26:31,157 --> 00:26:32,759
- Just like grandma made.

628
00:26:53,012 --> 00:26:54,681
(phone dial)

629
00:26:55,314 --> 00:26:57,149
- [Voiceover] Hi, this is
Professor Stewart Wisniewski

630
00:26:57,183 --> 00:26:58,751
and this is my
personal voicemail.

631
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:01,020
If you're calling about
office hours please call my--

632
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:02,288
(phone beep)

633
00:27:23,175 --> 00:27:28,180
(high intensity
electronic music)

634
00:28:02,849 --> 00:28:04,516
- [Colin] Wow, this
brings back memories.

635
00:28:06,318 --> 00:28:07,519
Never mind.

636
00:28:09,588 --> 00:28:11,257
Fine, when I was a
senior in high school

637
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:12,558
I used to fool
around with this guy

638
00:28:12,591 --> 00:28:16,428
on the fourth floor,
Kevin, Kevin--

639
00:28:16,462 --> 00:28:17,629
Oh shit.

640
00:28:17,663 --> 00:28:18,898
I don't think I ever
knew his last name.

641
00:28:18,931 --> 00:28:22,935
- Oh gee, that's real
classy Mr. Role Modal.

642
00:28:22,969 --> 00:28:23,836
Oh wait.

643
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:25,704
You have to wait a minute.

644
00:28:25,738 --> 00:28:27,173
- Tee, don't worry about it.

645
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:29,241
You should have seen how
messy I was in college.

646
00:28:29,275 --> 00:28:30,676
Drove Stu nuts.

647
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,644
- No, just wait here okay?

648
00:28:32,678 --> 00:28:34,213
- Okay.

649
00:28:34,981 --> 00:28:36,015
What room?

650
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:37,349
- 313.

651
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:38,484
- All right.

652
00:29:03,042 --> 00:29:04,076
- Okay.

653
00:29:04,543 --> 00:29:07,379
You can come in now.

654
00:29:15,988 --> 00:29:17,289
- Wow.

655
00:29:19,058 --> 00:29:20,793
Stu would approve.

656
00:29:23,162 --> 00:29:24,463
Well...

657
00:29:25,197 --> 00:29:27,233
- I always had to
clean my room or else.

658
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:32,939
- Why'd you transfer?

659
00:29:35,341 --> 00:29:37,743
- Just, distance.

660
00:29:38,344 --> 00:29:39,778
- As in you needed some?

661
00:29:44,851 --> 00:29:46,518
Tee, why do you have this?

662
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:48,354
- Pops sent it.

663
00:29:50,156 --> 00:29:51,623
- Why would you keep it?

664
00:29:55,995 --> 00:29:57,029
Oh.

665
00:29:58,697 --> 00:29:59,966
Babe.

666
00:30:09,608 --> 00:30:11,377
This is going.

667
00:30:15,781 --> 00:30:19,651
(moaning and grunting)

668
00:30:47,613 --> 00:30:48,981
- Put her on hold.

669
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:05,965
* Well I'm, self absorbed

670
00:31:05,998 --> 00:31:07,199
* and sex obsessed

671
00:31:07,233 --> 00:31:08,767
* I enjoy the excess

672
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,070
* I'm a fun little mess

673
00:31:11,103 --> 00:31:12,038
* I got the knowledge

674
00:31:12,071 --> 00:31:13,372
* but I failed the test

675
00:31:13,405 --> 00:31:14,907
* I came second best

676
00:31:14,941 --> 00:31:17,243
* like all of the rest

677
00:31:17,276 --> 00:31:19,878
* self indulged
and self inflicted

678
00:31:19,912 --> 00:31:23,549
* every word I say
may be contradicted

679
00:31:23,582 --> 00:31:25,884
* Now I'm laid out on my f--

680
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:34,560
- You're early.

681
00:31:34,593 --> 00:31:35,827
- Oh, yeah.

682
00:31:35,861 --> 00:31:38,064
I got a flight out this morning.

683
00:31:38,097 --> 00:31:39,698
And now I can't find my key.

684
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,167
I need to get the spare.

685
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,202
- Oh, right.

686
00:31:43,702 --> 00:31:44,703
- Hey, that smells good.

687
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,372
Have you got enough for two?

688
00:31:46,472 --> 00:31:47,974
The airline charged
me eight bucks

689
00:31:48,007 --> 00:31:50,076
for a so called
snack box containing

690
00:31:50,109 --> 00:31:52,011
the most baffling
assortment of crap.

691
00:31:52,211 --> 00:31:54,246
- Uh no, sorry.

692
00:31:56,182 --> 00:31:59,085
- So it turns out this trip
was a fucking waste of time.

693
00:31:59,118 --> 00:32:00,086
Shocker.

694
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:01,253
- I thought it was going well?

695
00:32:01,287 --> 00:32:04,356
- Ah, it was going
well until I--

696
00:32:04,991 --> 00:32:07,026
Um, hello.

697
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:08,794
Not enough for two.

698
00:32:08,827 --> 00:32:10,396
- Okay.

699
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:11,863
Sorry.

700
00:32:11,897 --> 00:32:13,699
- Oh my God you're blushing.

701
00:32:13,732 --> 00:32:14,833
- I am not.

702
00:32:15,134 --> 00:32:15,867
- Look at you.

703
00:32:15,901 --> 00:32:16,502
You're blushing.

704
00:32:16,535 --> 00:32:17,403
Who is it?

705
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:18,170
And how do I not know this?

706
00:32:18,204 --> 00:32:19,705
(door bell buzzing)

707
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:21,907
- Shit.

708
00:32:23,309 --> 00:32:24,176
You have to go.

709
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:30,182
Okay.

710
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:32,884
But you have got to promise...

711
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:34,153
to go easy.

712
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:38,090
It's Tee.

713
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:42,161
- No, the intern?

714
00:32:42,194 --> 00:32:44,763
- Come on, now don't get all--
- [Stewart] Oh Jesus Colin.

715
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,765
You know your little
fetish for post collegiates

716
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,700
is bad enough but
come on he's a fetus.

717
00:32:48,734 --> 00:32:50,902
- I know, I know, but...

718
00:32:51,537 --> 00:32:53,605
He's smart and...

719
00:32:54,573 --> 00:32:55,841
Kind of fascinating.

720
00:32:55,874 --> 00:32:57,909
He's got this totally
fucked up background.

721
00:32:57,943 --> 00:32:59,678
I mean fucked.

722
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:01,147
Up.

723
00:33:01,613 --> 00:33:03,449
Look, why don't you
stay for dinner?

724
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:06,352
Talk to him and you'll see.

725
00:33:07,186 --> 00:33:09,288
Or, you can tell
me that I'm crazy

726
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:12,158
because seriously I feel
like a teenager here.

727
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,326
- Well that makes two of you.

728
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:16,195
(door bell buzzing)

729
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:19,565
- He's 21.

730
00:33:20,232 --> 00:33:21,800
- Colin, he's an employee.

731
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,935
- Okay, technically he
doesn't report to me.

732
00:33:23,969 --> 00:33:25,771
He's Shar's intern.

733
00:33:26,305 --> 00:33:28,006
- Really, that's what
you're going with?

734
00:33:28,907 --> 00:33:31,343
I can't decide if this is
funny or just pathetic.

735
00:33:31,377 --> 00:33:32,644
(door bell buzzing)
- Be nice.

736
00:33:33,545 --> 00:33:36,115
- Well I'll try but
I make no promises.

737
00:33:41,253 --> 00:33:42,188
- Hey!

738
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:43,322
- Hi.

739
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,958
- Tee, you remember Stu?

740
00:33:48,094 --> 00:33:51,197
He's gonna be joining
us for dinner.

741
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,764
- Oh.

742
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:54,800
- [Colin] You're shitting me.

743
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:56,068
- [Stewart] Oh I shit you not.

744
00:33:56,102 --> 00:33:58,637
Cut his fingernails
during the interview.

745
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,506
- [Colin] What an asshole.

746
00:34:00,739 --> 00:34:03,075
- Well he was Hal Tate's
roommate at Princeton so...

747
00:34:03,109 --> 00:34:04,310
- So, that explains it.

748
00:34:04,343 --> 00:34:05,344
- Who?

749
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:06,945
- Doesn't matter.

750
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:08,614
You know, I had actually
forgotten about that.

751
00:34:08,647 --> 00:34:10,116
- Hal Tate was George's mentor

752
00:34:10,149 --> 00:34:11,517
when he taught at Georgetown.

753
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,951
- So isn't that a good thing?

754
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:14,920
- Stu started getting
more attention

755
00:34:14,953 --> 00:34:15,954
and Tate didn't--

756
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:16,888
- We got into a pissing contest

757
00:34:16,922 --> 00:34:18,690
and his dick was bigger, okay?

758
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:20,159
Moving on.

759
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,729
Anyway, it's beside the
point because they're also

760
00:34:23,762 --> 00:34:26,198
talking to Patricia
Braxton Hall.

761
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:27,866
- [Tee] Who?

762
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,935
(silverware slammed)

763
00:34:29,968 --> 00:34:32,638
- [Colin] Stewart, I'm
not even sure who that is.

764
00:34:32,671 --> 00:34:34,039
- The Black Ann Coulter.

765
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,174
- Oh.

766
00:34:35,641 --> 00:34:36,475
Her.

767
00:34:36,642 --> 00:34:38,377
She's a piece of work.

768
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:40,045
- She is appalling
but she's smart

769
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,248
and she's a diversity wet dream.

770
00:34:42,281 --> 00:34:43,682
- Can use the computer?

771
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:45,751
- I'm sorry babe.

772
00:34:45,784 --> 00:34:46,885
We just had a lot
to catch up on.

773
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:47,686
- It's okay.

774
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:48,920
Can I use it?

775
00:34:49,455 --> 00:34:51,757
- You didn't like
the cacciatore?

776
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:53,959
- No, I'm not that hungry.

777
00:34:55,727 --> 00:34:57,396
- Want me to make
you a sandwich?

778
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:58,630
- No, I'm good.

779
00:35:00,632 --> 00:35:03,302
- [Colin] Take the
laptop by the bed.

780
00:35:12,744 --> 00:35:14,813
- Want me to make
you a sandwich?

781
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:16,014
- [Colin] Shut it.

782
00:36:04,129 --> 00:36:05,564
(exhales deeply)

783
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:33,191
(breathes frantically)

784
00:36:36,428 --> 00:36:41,199
(suspenseful slow music)

785
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:16,101
- Hey.

786
00:37:16,134 --> 00:37:19,004
Oh, uh, sorry.

787
00:37:19,137 --> 00:37:20,906
- [Tee] Use the damn doorbell!

788
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:29,748
(doorbell buzzing)

789
00:37:32,017 --> 00:37:33,018
- What are you saying man?

790
00:37:33,051 --> 00:37:34,453
You're anti-gay marriage?

791
00:37:34,486 --> 00:37:36,288
- No, I'm not saying
that at all but,

792
00:37:36,322 --> 00:37:38,457
let's be honest, it's
a tradition designed

793
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:40,559
to foster procreation
in a specific way.

794
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:43,161
With a dominant husband
and a subservient wife.

795
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:46,965
So, how is that a useful model
for homosexual relationships?

796
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:48,867
Not even straight people
but that shit anymore.

797
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,403
- There are legal rights
that come with marriage, man.

798
00:37:51,437 --> 00:37:53,004
It' not just about procreation.

799
00:37:53,038 --> 00:37:54,506
There's not fertility
requirement.

800
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,007
Sterile people can
still get married.

801
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:57,409
- Oh and I wish they would.

802
00:37:57,443 --> 00:38:00,078
- We're being treated
differently under the law.

803
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:01,647
Civil rights.

804
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,881
- Now there I agree with you.

805
00:38:02,914 --> 00:38:04,383
Marriage may be a farce but

806
00:38:04,416 --> 00:38:05,884
we should have
equal access to it.

807
00:38:06,452 --> 00:38:07,753
- You just like to argue.

808
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:09,287
- You're catching on.

809
00:38:09,855 --> 00:38:10,689
- Whatever.

810
00:38:10,722 --> 00:38:11,890
I gotta pee.

811
00:38:11,923 --> 00:38:13,325
- Well golly, thanks
for the update.

812
00:38:16,695 --> 00:38:17,563
What?

813
00:38:17,596 --> 00:38:20,231
- I can tell you like him.

814
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:22,100
- Well let's not
get carried away.

815
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:25,070
Fine.

816
00:38:25,103 --> 00:38:26,338
He is very right
for a sixth grader.

817
00:38:26,372 --> 00:38:27,238
Happy?

818
00:38:27,706 --> 00:38:28,674
- Delighted.

819
00:38:32,878 --> 00:38:34,380
Is that all he's eating?

820
00:38:34,413 --> 00:38:36,915
- Wasting bacon, that's
just wrong. (phone chiming)

821
00:38:39,418 --> 00:38:41,086
- (screaming) Show time!

822
00:38:41,687 --> 00:38:42,821
Babe!

823
00:38:51,129 --> 00:38:52,731
- [Mike] Greetings
Pittsburghers.

824
00:38:52,764 --> 00:38:53,899
I'm Mike Steinman.

825
00:38:53,932 --> 00:38:55,734
- [Colin] And I'm
Colin McCormack.

826
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:58,370
And this is the
Pittsburgh Pulse.

827
00:38:58,404 --> 00:39:00,138
Thanks for sharing
your Saturday with us.

828
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,007
- [Mike] This week we're
taking a closer look

829
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,710
at the state of renewable
energy in Pennsylvania.

830
00:39:04,743 --> 00:39:06,044
Is it for real?

831
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:08,046
Or just a lot of expensive
wishful thinking?

832
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,181
- [Colin] Like Mike's
gym membership.

833
00:39:10,215 --> 00:39:11,617
- [Mike] Exactly.

834
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,919
- [Colin] Our guest today
are Patty Hickenlooper,

835
00:39:13,952 --> 00:39:16,655
Executive Director of the
Green States Initiative,

836
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:19,858
and Republican State
Senator George Winston.

837
00:39:20,058 --> 00:39:21,259
But first let's take a look--

838
00:39:23,962 --> 00:39:26,398
(typing on keyboard)

839
00:39:44,616 --> 00:39:45,551
There you are.

840
00:39:47,085 --> 00:39:48,620
Tee, it's okay.

841
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,956
You know you can use it.

842
00:39:52,624 --> 00:39:53,792
Can't sleep again?

843
00:39:58,864 --> 00:40:00,432
So what have we got here?

844
00:40:00,466 --> 00:40:02,434
(chuckling) You're looking
at porn aren't you?

845
00:40:02,468 --> 00:40:03,201
Let me see.

846
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,302
Let me see.

847
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:05,504
- No!

848
00:40:06,872 --> 00:40:08,807
- Hey, where did you
get that picture?

849
00:40:09,475 --> 00:40:10,842
You friended my dad?

850
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:13,979
- You're account was logged on.

851
00:40:14,012 --> 00:40:15,581
I just kind of--

852
00:40:15,614 --> 00:40:17,048
- Tee, that's not...

853
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:19,885
- When you talk about him
he sounds really cool.

854
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:27,993
- Yeah.

855
00:40:29,628 --> 00:40:30,729
I'm lucky.

856
00:40:31,296 --> 00:40:32,163
I know.

857
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:37,503
(chuckles) God.

858
00:40:38,069 --> 00:40:39,838
I was so young.

859
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:43,208
I was so proud of that fish.

860
00:40:43,241 --> 00:40:46,545
Dad made me feel like
I'd landed a great white.

861
00:40:47,212 --> 00:40:48,614
What else we have in here?

862
00:40:50,315 --> 00:40:51,483
Wow.

863
00:40:51,917 --> 00:40:53,719
It's after we won
state championship.

864
00:40:54,486 --> 00:40:55,386
Junior year.

865
00:40:58,690 --> 00:40:59,625
Oh.

866
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:01,159
I love that one.

867
00:41:01,493 --> 00:41:02,961
Stu and me, commencement day.

868
00:41:03,862 --> 00:41:05,731
See, he does smile.

869
00:41:11,503 --> 00:41:12,604
That's...

870
00:41:13,171 --> 00:41:14,840
Christmas in Aspen 90...

871
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:16,007
Six?

872
00:41:16,608 --> 00:41:18,309
97, does it say?

873
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,945
- Why is Stu there?

874
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:24,015
- He usually does the
holidays with my folks.

875
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:27,352
His dad's a marine.

876
00:41:27,385 --> 00:41:29,387
Super conservative.

877
00:41:29,855 --> 00:41:31,189
And an asshole.

878
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:32,524
Plus...

879
00:41:32,858 --> 00:41:34,893
His mom kind of drinks.

880
00:41:37,062 --> 00:41:38,530
- But you guys were never...

881
00:41:39,297 --> 00:41:40,532
- No.

882
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:44,570
I mean, we fooled around
some in college but...

883
00:41:45,403 --> 00:41:46,437
No.

884
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:50,075
He's my best friend.

885
00:41:56,381 --> 00:41:57,282
Okay.

886
00:41:58,149 --> 00:42:00,819
I need to get some sleep.

887
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:02,888
Come on.

888
00:42:05,223 --> 00:42:07,593
Or maybe just get some.

889
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,428
(car honking)

890
00:42:56,608 --> 00:42:58,810
(doorbell buzzing)

891
00:43:02,714 --> 00:43:03,782
- Can we go now?

892
00:43:04,482 --> 00:43:05,717
- Come on Babe!

893
00:43:16,194 --> 00:43:17,562
- [Colin] So maybe you
can help me prep on

894
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,264
the constitutional arguments.

895
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:21,466
- Yeah sure, I can pull
some stuff together.

896
00:43:21,499 --> 00:43:22,701
- I can do it.

897
00:43:22,734 --> 00:43:24,469
- (chuckles) Thanks
Babe, but I think

898
00:43:24,502 --> 00:43:26,437
this is more Stu's bailiwick.

899
00:43:27,572 --> 00:43:29,407
- [Stu] Chipotle maple syrup.

900
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,042
That's perverse.

901
00:43:31,076 --> 00:43:33,078
- No, it's just different.

902
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:34,145
Try it.

903
00:43:34,713 --> 00:43:35,513
- [Voiceover] Tee!

904
00:43:35,881 --> 00:43:36,848
- Hey Cat!

905
00:43:37,282 --> 00:43:38,950
- [Cat] How the hell you been?

906
00:43:38,984 --> 00:43:40,351
- Oh my gosh!

907
00:43:40,919 --> 00:43:41,953
Colin McCormack.

908
00:43:42,721 --> 00:43:43,689
I love your show.

909
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:45,090
(chuckles)

910
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:46,224
And you...

911
00:43:46,257 --> 00:43:47,258
Such a hottie.

912
00:43:47,292 --> 00:43:49,127
- Why thank you, gorgeous.

913
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,295
(giggling)

914
00:43:50,328 --> 00:43:52,698
- You keep giving
that Steinman hell.

915
00:43:52,998 --> 00:43:53,799
- I will.

916
00:43:53,832 --> 00:43:55,566
I promise.

917
00:43:58,837 --> 00:44:00,471
Who's your daddy?

918
00:44:01,372 --> 00:44:03,942
- Is the irony of that
completely lost on you?

919
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:05,243
- Huh?

920
00:44:08,013 --> 00:44:09,214
Shut it.

921
00:44:09,715 --> 00:44:11,549
- I mean, I will concede
he's not your usual

922
00:44:11,582 --> 00:44:13,118
frat boy type but
I'm not used to your

923
00:44:13,151 --> 00:44:15,453
little conquests hanging
around like this.

924
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:16,722
- Stewart...

925
00:44:17,222 --> 00:44:19,424
He's not a little conquest.

926
00:44:20,158 --> 00:44:21,860
I really think I...

927
00:44:24,295 --> 00:44:25,697
I don't know.

928
00:44:26,264 --> 00:44:29,134
Maybe, the Greeks
were on to something.

929
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:32,003
You know that older
younger thing?

930
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,439
- Please, those stories
never ended well.

931
00:44:34,472 --> 00:44:36,041
Someone was always
stabbing out their eyes

932
00:44:36,074 --> 00:44:37,275
or getting chained to a rock.

933
00:44:37,976 --> 00:44:39,677
- Just ease up a bit.

934
00:44:40,345 --> 00:44:41,346
Please.

935
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:42,647
Fine.

936
00:44:46,551 --> 00:44:47,886
Does he...

937
00:44:48,419 --> 00:44:50,355
Look thin to you?

938
00:44:52,323 --> 00:44:53,524
Oh God.

939
00:44:58,496 --> 00:44:59,364
- [Lockwood] There
is no such thing

940
00:44:59,397 --> 00:45:00,866
as a gay child.

941
00:45:00,899 --> 00:45:02,834
If a young person tells you that

942
00:45:02,868 --> 00:45:05,837
what they are saying is
they have embraced Satan.

943
00:45:05,871 --> 00:45:07,238
You do not love that.

944
00:45:07,272 --> 00:45:08,506
You do not accept that.

945
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:10,008
You cannot accept that.

946
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:11,476
You must fight the Devil.

947
00:45:11,509 --> 00:45:14,112
And you must make that
young person understand

948
00:45:14,145 --> 00:45:15,446
the evil in the--

949
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,281
- [Colin] Tee.

950
00:45:18,016 --> 00:45:18,784
You okay?

951
00:45:18,984 --> 00:45:19,617
(mumbling yes)

952
00:45:19,885 --> 00:45:20,919
So...

953
00:45:22,387 --> 00:45:23,621
We tape tomorrow.

954
00:45:24,489 --> 00:45:25,456
What have we got?

955
00:45:25,656 --> 00:45:26,792
- I pulled a bunch of stuff

956
00:45:26,825 --> 00:45:28,659
but it's all variations
on the same thing.

957
00:45:29,928 --> 00:45:31,062
- Damn.

958
00:45:31,496 --> 00:45:32,831
- There's this
from the Inquirer.

959
00:45:32,864 --> 00:45:34,532
- No, I don't think we
want to go down that route.

960
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:35,300
Shit.

961
00:45:36,134 --> 00:45:37,035
Well, we tried.

962
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:38,770
- Colin, I'm sorry.

963
00:45:38,904 --> 00:45:39,838
- Hey.

964
00:45:40,638 --> 00:45:41,339
Don't worry.

965
00:45:41,372 --> 00:45:42,540
You did great.

966
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:43,741
Really.

967
00:45:43,775 --> 00:45:44,910
Maybe there's a
reason no one can--

968
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:46,244
- Tee?

969
00:45:46,778 --> 00:45:47,512
I'm heading out now.

970
00:45:47,545 --> 00:45:49,280
Don't stay too late.

971
00:45:49,314 --> 00:45:51,349
- We were just (clears throat)

972
00:45:51,382 --> 00:45:53,384
Doing some stuff for
tomorrow's Pulse episode.

973
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:54,986
- Okay.

974
00:45:56,054 --> 00:45:57,989
He's not working
you too hard is he?

975
00:45:58,023 --> 00:45:59,057
- [Tee] No ma'am.

976
00:46:01,126 --> 00:46:02,928
- All righty then.

977
00:46:04,329 --> 00:46:05,730
Good night.

978
00:46:05,897 --> 00:46:07,365
- Have a good night.

979
00:46:07,398 --> 00:46:08,599
- Mhmm.

980
00:46:17,542 --> 00:46:18,343
- Tee!

981
00:46:19,377 --> 00:46:21,379
Tee, Jesus Babe, we--

982
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,349
We just, we need to
be more careful here.

983
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:26,084
Okay?

984
00:46:27,152 --> 00:46:28,153
Okay?

985
00:46:29,888 --> 00:46:31,056
My place at seven.

986
00:46:31,689 --> 00:46:33,091
We'll go for a run.

987
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,414
(Colin complaining of pain)

988
00:46:56,447 --> 00:46:57,348
- Sorry.

989
00:46:58,149 --> 00:46:59,084
- Didn't even see it.

990
00:46:59,117 --> 00:47:00,818
Fuckin' rat on a leash.

991
00:47:00,852 --> 00:47:01,752
Damn.

992
00:47:02,053 --> 00:47:03,221
I really scraped it.

993
00:47:03,922 --> 00:47:04,923
- I'll get the peroxide.

994
00:47:08,259 --> 00:47:09,460
(door slamming)
- Stewart!

995
00:47:09,494 --> 00:47:10,661
- What?

996
00:47:10,695 --> 00:47:11,829
Oh Christ.

997
00:47:11,863 --> 00:47:13,031
Yeah yeah yeah yeah.

998
00:47:13,064 --> 00:47:13,698
Ding dong.

999
00:47:14,499 --> 00:47:16,201
Holy crap.

1000
00:47:16,234 --> 00:47:17,735
You should put some
peroxide on that.

1001
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:18,904
- We know.

1002
00:47:19,504 --> 00:47:21,072
- Why are you in such a tizzy?

1003
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:22,807
- She said no.

1004
00:47:23,074 --> 00:47:23,708
- Who?

1005
00:47:23,741 --> 00:47:25,076
- Braxton Hall.

1006
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:26,311
At the last minute,
decided she didn't want to

1007
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:27,478
make her kids change
schools or something.

1008
00:47:27,512 --> 00:47:29,414
- So, does that mean...

1009
00:47:29,447 --> 00:47:30,681
- They just called.

1010
00:47:32,951 --> 00:47:33,784
- Wow.

1011
00:47:34,052 --> 00:47:34,920
That's...

1012
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:36,487
Well done my friend.

1013
00:47:36,654 --> 00:47:37,755
Congratulations.

1014
00:47:38,156 --> 00:47:40,158
Tee, congratulations
are in order.

1015
00:47:40,191 --> 00:47:41,659
Stewart got the job.

1016
00:47:41,927 --> 00:47:42,593
- Really?

1017
00:47:42,627 --> 00:47:43,294
That's awesome.

1018
00:47:43,328 --> 00:47:44,362
When do you go?

1019
00:47:45,096 --> 00:47:46,898
- I haven't actually said yes.

1020
00:47:47,565 --> 00:47:48,833
- You...

1021
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,868
- Honestly, I thought
it was a lost cause.

1022
00:47:50,902 --> 00:47:52,870
I told them I'd have
to think about it.

1023
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:56,374
What do you think I should do?

1024
00:47:56,407 --> 00:47:57,608
- You're asking me?

1025
00:47:57,642 --> 00:47:58,809
- [Stewart] Yeah.

1026
00:47:59,544 --> 00:48:01,412
- Well, I tell you what...

1027
00:48:01,812 --> 00:48:03,381
We're going to
dinner at Pablo's.

1028
00:48:03,414 --> 00:48:05,250
Why don't you come with us and--

1029
00:48:05,283 --> 00:48:06,317
(complaining of pain)

1030
00:48:07,485 --> 00:48:09,254
Babe, careful please.

1031
00:48:09,754 --> 00:48:10,455
- Sorry.

1032
00:48:11,089 --> 00:48:12,357
All done.

1033
00:48:13,424 --> 00:48:15,226
- Colin, I could really
use your advice on this.

1034
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:16,427
Does he have to--

1035
00:48:16,527 --> 00:48:18,563
Um, can you take a
rain check on dinner

1036
00:48:18,596 --> 00:48:19,564
just this once?

1037
00:48:19,597 --> 00:48:20,498
- No!

1038
00:48:20,531 --> 00:48:22,267
- Seriously?
Colin!

1039
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:23,434
- Jesus.

1040
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:26,437
Fine, how is this,

1041
00:48:26,804 --> 00:48:29,007
Stu, let's go grab a drink.

1042
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,608
Talk it through.

1043
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:33,111
And then, Tee can
join for dinner.

1044
00:48:33,544 --> 00:48:34,412
- Great.

1045
00:48:34,445 --> 00:48:35,680
What's my time allotment?

1046
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:40,385
- Babe, would it be okay if--

1047
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:41,752
- Whatever.

1048
00:48:41,786 --> 00:48:43,754
I got some stuff I
can do at the dorm.

1049
00:48:43,989 --> 00:48:45,190
- You sure?

1050
00:48:45,223 --> 00:48:46,457
- Yeah.

1051
00:48:46,724 --> 00:48:47,658
- Okay.

1052
00:48:47,792 --> 00:48:48,559
Thanks.

1053
00:48:48,793 --> 00:48:49,995
Come here.

1054
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:58,669
- Did you see that
look he just shot me?

1055
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:02,140
- You're being too sensitive.

1056
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:03,341
- Uh huh.

1057
00:49:03,374 --> 00:49:04,109
(door slammed)

1058
00:49:04,142 --> 00:49:05,210
- He's--

1059
00:49:06,611 --> 00:49:08,079
He's not sleeping.

1060
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:11,182
I think he's just tired.

1061
00:49:11,216 --> 00:49:12,617
- Well then get him some Ambien.

1062
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:13,851
Or better yet, a shrink.

1063
00:49:13,884 --> 00:49:15,120
Because I'm telling you,

1064
00:49:15,153 --> 00:49:16,621
there is something not
right about this kid.

1065
00:49:16,654 --> 00:49:17,622
- Look.

1066
00:49:17,655 --> 00:49:19,524
I know Tee's a little intense.

1067
00:49:19,557 --> 00:49:20,725
I'm not an idiot.

1068
00:49:21,059 --> 00:49:24,062
But I like the fact
that he needs me.

1069
00:49:24,629 --> 00:49:25,530
That I...

1070
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:27,598
Feel I can take care of him.

1071
00:49:27,632 --> 00:49:28,433
- Well that's just sweet.

1072
00:49:28,466 --> 00:49:29,500
But don't you feel--

1073
00:49:29,534 --> 00:49:30,535
- I called empathy Stewart!

1074
00:49:30,568 --> 00:49:32,270
I know it's not your thing.

1075
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:33,904
- Not my thing?

1076
00:49:33,938 --> 00:49:35,440
- Don't you get tired of it?

1077
00:49:35,473 --> 00:49:37,608
Keeping the world
at arms length.

1078
00:49:37,642 --> 00:49:39,277
That's what you do, you know.

1079
00:49:39,677 --> 00:49:41,012
- So this is about me?

1080
00:49:41,046 --> 00:49:42,080
- Yeah, it is.

1081
00:49:42,313 --> 00:49:43,748
'Cause you can't stand the fact

1082
00:49:43,781 --> 00:49:45,650
that I found someone.

1083
00:49:45,683 --> 00:49:46,484
Someone I actually care about.

1084
00:49:46,517 --> 00:49:47,685
You know why?

1085
00:49:47,718 --> 00:49:48,719
'Cause it means you
might actually have

1086
00:49:48,753 --> 00:49:50,188
to find your own life.

1087
00:49:50,221 --> 00:49:51,989
Instead of glomming onto mine.

1088
00:49:52,857 --> 00:49:53,924
- You think that I--

1089
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:57,562
Oh my God, you're ego is just--

1090
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:00,165
Fuck you.

1091
00:50:00,565 --> 00:50:01,666
Fuck you.

1092
00:50:02,567 --> 00:50:04,069
Just, fuck you.

1093
00:50:04,102 --> 00:50:05,270
I am out of here.

1094
00:50:08,173 --> 00:50:09,807
Enjoy your empathy.

1095
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,410
- You know I'm right!

1096
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:14,412
(door slammed)

1097
00:50:14,445 --> 00:50:15,480
- Stewart!

1098
00:50:21,486 --> 00:50:22,253
Fuck.

1099
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:30,528
(solemn piano music)

1100
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:23,881
(typing)

1101
00:51:34,125 --> 00:51:34,992
(elevator dinging)

1102
00:51:35,025 --> 00:51:35,626
- Hey Amber, is Colin in--

1103
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:37,228
- Hello!

1104
00:51:37,262 --> 00:51:38,095
- Yeah, hi.

1105
00:51:38,129 --> 00:51:39,297
So is he--

1106
00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:40,165
What?

1107
00:51:40,198 --> 00:51:42,700
Hey buddy!

1108
00:51:42,733 --> 00:51:44,502
- Reverend Lockwood.

1109
00:51:44,535 --> 00:51:45,503
I'm Amber Fletcher.

1110
00:51:45,536 --> 00:51:47,004
We spoke on the phone.

1111
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:48,939
- The pleasure is all mine.

1112
00:51:50,241 --> 00:51:52,510
Hi. I'm Irvin Lockwood.

1113
00:51:52,543 --> 00:51:54,111
- Hi, I'm gay.

1114
00:51:54,679 --> 00:51:56,080
He in his office?

1115
00:51:56,347 --> 00:51:58,616
- I am so sorry about that.

1116
00:51:58,649 --> 00:52:00,318
He's not with the show.

1117
00:52:00,885 --> 00:52:02,119
Please, follow me.

1118
00:52:04,289 --> 00:52:05,856
- I don't know what I'm supposed

1119
00:52:05,890 --> 00:52:06,791
to do with this now.

1120
00:52:06,824 --> 00:52:08,025
You couldn't make bullet points?

1121
00:52:08,058 --> 00:52:10,027
- Yeah well excuse me
for being thorough.

1122
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:11,262
- We got him!

1123
00:52:11,296 --> 00:52:12,430
- Calm down Tee.

1124
00:52:12,463 --> 00:52:14,199
- Just read it.

1125
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:19,270
- Stu can you give us a second?

1126
00:52:20,338 --> 00:52:21,772
- Uh, yeah.

1127
00:52:21,806 --> 00:52:22,440
Sure.

1128
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:27,278
Tee.

1129
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:30,481
What is this?

1130
00:52:30,515 --> 00:52:31,782
- Did you see what he
says about her pussy?

1131
00:52:31,816 --> 00:52:33,518
- Where did you get this?

1132
00:52:33,551 --> 00:52:35,019
This is Lockwood's
personal email.

1133
00:52:35,052 --> 00:52:35,953
Where did you get it?

1134
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:37,087
Did somebody give this to you?

1135
00:52:38,523 --> 00:52:39,757
Holy shit!

1136
00:52:40,391 --> 00:52:41,359
Tee, don't they
teach you ethics?

1137
00:52:41,392 --> 00:52:42,927
We can't use this!

1138
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:43,561
- But that's proof--

1139
00:52:43,594 --> 00:52:45,196
- Enough!

1140
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:46,831
- I just thought--

1141
00:52:46,864 --> 00:52:48,065
- I can't deal with
this right now.

1142
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:55,306
- [Stewart] What the
hell was that all about?

1143
00:52:56,241 --> 00:52:56,874
Is everything all right?

1144
00:52:56,907 --> 00:52:59,477
- Don't.
Okay.

1145
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:00,611
Just don't.

1146
00:53:04,349 --> 00:53:04,949
- [Tee] Hey, I got you!
- [Amber] Tee!

1147
00:53:04,982 --> 00:53:05,883
You hear me?

1148
00:53:05,916 --> 00:53:06,917
You're a fucking hypocrite

1149
00:53:06,951 --> 00:53:08,118
and I got you!

1150
00:53:08,152 --> 00:53:09,153
- [Lockwood] You better
get out of my face!

1151
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:10,221
Take a step back.

1152
00:53:10,255 --> 00:53:11,522
- [Lockwood's body guard] Hey!

1153
00:53:11,556 --> 00:53:12,156
You hear the man.

1154
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:13,057
Back off!

1155
00:53:13,090 --> 00:53:13,758
- [Tee] A fucking hypocrite!

1156
00:53:13,791 --> 00:53:15,059
(loud thump)

1157
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:16,361
(people screaming)

1158
00:53:16,394 --> 00:53:17,094
- [Voiceover] Oh my God!

1159
00:53:17,127 --> 00:53:17,728
- Shit!

1160
00:53:17,762 --> 00:53:18,496
Call 911!

1161
00:53:18,529 --> 00:53:19,297
Honey, are you okay?

1162
00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:20,598
- I barely pushed him.

1163
00:53:20,631 --> 00:53:21,732
- Tee, can you hear me?

1164
00:53:21,766 --> 00:53:22,667
- I don't think you
should move him.

1165
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:23,801
- That boy was out of control

1166
00:53:23,834 --> 00:53:24,569
You saw.

1167
00:53:24,602 --> 00:53:25,470
- Somebody call 911!

1168
00:53:25,503 --> 00:53:26,971
- What the hell happened?

1169
00:53:27,004 --> 00:53:28,573
- Babe, it'll be okay.

1170
00:53:28,606 --> 00:53:30,241
- [Voiceover] Fifth floor.

1171
00:53:30,275 --> 00:53:32,009
He's not moving.

1172
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:40,551
(suspenseful music)

1173
00:55:09,407 --> 00:55:11,442
(phone ringing)

1174
00:55:20,618 --> 00:55:22,019
- Yo.

1175
00:55:22,052 --> 00:55:23,854
- [Colin] Any luck tracking
down the grandparents?

1176
00:55:23,888 --> 00:55:26,457
- No, his...

1177
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:29,994
Phone and computer are
password protected and...

1178
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:33,297
Anyway I don't think they're
very big correspondents.

1179
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:38,403
Listen Colin, I'm
gonna come get you.

1180
00:55:38,436 --> 00:55:40,571
- [Colin] No, Tee's awake but
they've gotta run some tests

1181
00:55:40,605 --> 00:55:41,806
before they'll release him.

1182
00:55:42,072 --> 00:55:43,774
We'll just cab it
back to my place.

1183
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:46,243
- Okay, but Colin I--

1184
00:55:46,276 --> 00:55:47,311
- [Colin] Hang on,
here comes the doctor.

1185
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:48,579
I gotta go.

1186
00:56:04,995 --> 00:56:05,930
- Easy.

1187
00:56:05,963 --> 00:56:06,631
- I'm fine.

1188
00:56:06,664 --> 00:56:07,765
- Babe.

1189
00:56:09,934 --> 00:56:10,835
- Hey.

1190
00:56:12,136 --> 00:56:12,903
- Hey.

1191
00:56:12,937 --> 00:56:13,871
Give me a hand?

1192
00:56:13,904 --> 00:56:14,705
- I'm fine.

1193
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:16,774
I just need to sit down.

1194
00:56:22,747 --> 00:56:23,948
- He's got a concussion.

1195
00:56:24,582 --> 00:56:25,315
Look after him.

1196
00:56:25,349 --> 00:56:26,617
I gotta pay the cab.

1197
00:56:46,303 --> 00:56:47,472
- Yeah.

1198
00:56:53,578 --> 00:56:55,379
I think I get it.

1199
00:56:57,648 --> 00:56:58,683
I really think I do.

1200
00:56:58,716 --> 00:56:59,917
I mean...

1201
00:57:02,286 --> 00:57:03,688
I've barely spoken to my father

1202
00:57:03,721 --> 00:57:05,723
in almost 20 years, you know?

1203
00:57:06,223 --> 00:57:07,592
And before that, well...

1204
00:57:10,895 --> 00:57:12,262
So I understand.

1205
00:57:14,298 --> 00:57:16,300
Growing up without
that connection.

1206
00:57:17,034 --> 00:57:18,536
It hurts, I know.

1207
00:57:20,204 --> 00:57:21,639
- What do you want?

1208
00:57:25,476 --> 00:57:26,877
- He has to know.

1209
00:57:27,111 --> 00:57:28,145
- Fuck you!

1210
00:57:29,013 --> 00:57:31,682
- Tee, you have got to tell him.

1211
00:57:31,716 --> 00:57:33,684
- Tell who what?

1212
00:57:34,985 --> 00:57:36,086
- Colin, I'm just going to--

1213
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:37,387
- [Colin] Sit!

1214
00:57:40,658 --> 00:57:43,260
Why are you upsetting him?

1215
00:57:50,668 --> 00:57:51,802
- Everything's okay.

1216
00:57:52,837 --> 00:57:55,272
We just have to talk.

1217
00:57:57,808 --> 00:57:58,643
That's all.

1218
00:57:58,676 --> 00:57:59,677
Right, Tee?

1219
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:01,311
Right?

1220
00:58:08,719 --> 00:58:09,687
- Tee?

1221
00:58:23,433 --> 00:58:24,802
Is there something you...

1222
00:58:25,936 --> 00:58:27,337
Need to tell me?

1223
00:58:31,241 --> 00:58:32,743
Babe, it's okay.

1224
00:58:37,815 --> 00:58:40,084
You know you can
tell me anything.

1225
00:58:45,923 --> 00:58:47,692
(sniffling)

1226
00:59:25,195 --> 00:59:26,263
What is this?

1227
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:32,837
- When you donated,

1228
00:59:33,638 --> 00:59:35,706
you gave them permission
to release your identity

1229
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:37,675
to any results.

1230
00:59:39,209 --> 00:59:40,444
- I know but why...

1231
00:59:42,279 --> 00:59:43,080
I mean.

1232
00:59:52,222 --> 00:59:53,157
Oh my God.

1233
00:59:56,193 --> 00:59:58,028
Did your mom...

1234
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:03,834
Are you?

1235
01:00:10,307 --> 01:00:11,608
Oh God.

1236
01:00:12,743 --> 01:00:14,144
Oh God, what have we done?

1237
01:00:14,178 --> 01:00:14,879
- Colin--

1238
01:00:14,912 --> 01:00:15,646
- Don't.

1239
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:16,580
Get the fuck off me!

1240
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:17,347
- Okay.

1241
01:00:17,381 --> 01:00:18,015
Hey, just calm down.

1242
01:00:18,048 --> 01:00:19,583
- He's my son!

1243
01:00:21,485 --> 01:00:22,252
And you knew?

1244
01:00:22,286 --> 01:00:23,253
- No Colin, I just--

1245
01:00:23,287 --> 01:00:24,054
- Colin, please.

1246
01:00:24,088 --> 01:00:25,656
- You let me fuck you!

1247
01:00:25,690 --> 01:00:27,224
- I thought it was worth it!

1248
01:00:27,257 --> 01:00:28,025
- Worth what?!

1249
01:00:28,058 --> 01:00:29,193
Are you insane?!

1250
01:00:29,226 --> 01:00:30,460
- Colin!

1251
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:32,797
- Get him out of here.

1252
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:36,266
When I get back I
want both of you gone.

1253
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:41,638
(door slams)

1254
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:46,043
(crying)

1255
01:00:46,143 --> 01:00:47,344
- Oh hey!
Hey.

1256
01:00:47,377 --> 01:00:48,045
Hey stop that.

1257
01:00:48,078 --> 01:00:48,679
Tee, damn it.

1258
01:00:48,713 --> 01:00:49,513
Stop.

1259
01:00:49,546 --> 01:00:50,948
(crying uncontrollably)

1260
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:51,615
Stop that.
Stop it.

1261
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:53,617
Jesus.
Stop that.

1262
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:54,284
Stop it.

1263
01:00:54,318 --> 01:00:56,754
(shushing)

1264
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:02,459
(sobbing)

1265
01:01:12,236 --> 01:01:17,241
(high intensity
suspenseful music)

1266
01:01:57,281 --> 01:01:58,382
(doorbell buzzing)

1267
01:02:09,293 --> 01:02:10,394
- Colin!

1268
01:02:12,963 --> 01:02:14,431
(knocking on door)

1269
01:02:14,598 --> 01:02:15,665
- [Stewart] Colin?

1270
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,768
(doorbell buzzing)

1271
01:02:23,373 --> 01:02:28,378
(loud rock music)

1272
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:31,648
- Colin, can I come in?

1273
01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:41,358
Colin.

1274
01:02:45,863 --> 01:02:46,797
Colin.

1275
01:02:46,897 --> 01:02:48,132
Can I come in?

1276
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:14,158
(loud rock music)

1277
01:03:27,204 --> 01:03:29,573
(vomiting)

1278
01:04:12,917 --> 01:04:14,418
- I waited my whole life.

1279
01:04:17,354 --> 01:04:18,488
To know.

1280
01:04:21,758 --> 01:04:23,127
My dad.

1281
01:04:28,298 --> 01:04:30,067
Just wanted to be near him.

1282
01:04:30,567 --> 01:04:32,569
- So why didn't
you just tell him?

1283
01:04:33,237 --> 01:04:34,238
Before.

1284
01:04:35,505 --> 01:04:37,507
- I didn't know how he'd react.

1285
01:04:40,010 --> 01:04:42,046
He didn't need to
know who I was.

1286
01:04:44,581 --> 01:04:45,715
I just...

1287
01:04:48,452 --> 01:04:50,487
Wanted him to like me.

1288
01:04:52,957 --> 01:04:54,824
It was going so good, you know.

1289
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:56,961
Working together.

1290
01:05:00,764 --> 01:05:03,267
Then he kissed me and
got all freaked out.

1291
01:05:05,069 --> 01:05:06,536
I thought I cold just...

1292
01:05:08,505 --> 01:05:09,839
But...

1293
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:17,714
- Jesus.

1294
01:05:19,016 --> 01:05:20,951
- It's all fucked up, isn't it?

1295
01:05:25,589 --> 01:05:26,790
- Yeah Tee, it is.

1296
01:05:26,823 --> 01:05:28,092
It's...

1297
01:05:28,692 --> 01:05:30,394
It's pretty fucked up.

1298
01:05:39,636 --> 01:05:42,006
I want you to talk to someone.

1299
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:44,808
Professional.

1300
01:05:45,375 --> 01:05:46,410
Okay?

1301
01:05:47,511 --> 01:05:48,778
- Yeah.

1302
01:05:50,614 --> 01:05:52,082
- I mean it.

1303
01:05:52,882 --> 01:05:54,651
Do you need me to help
you find someone or...

1304
01:05:54,684 --> 01:05:56,686
- They got em at student health.

1305
01:05:58,555 --> 01:05:59,689
- Good.

1306
01:06:17,941 --> 01:06:19,176
(voice machine beep)

1307
01:06:19,576 --> 01:06:21,211
- [Colin's boss]
Colin, listen um,

1308
01:06:21,845 --> 01:06:22,712
Christ, you better come

1309
01:06:22,746 --> 01:06:24,348
to the conference room.

1310
01:06:25,082 --> 01:06:26,283
Now, okay.

1311
01:06:37,427 --> 01:06:39,663
- [Voiceover] This
isn't necessary stuff?

1312
01:06:39,696 --> 01:06:40,830
It's what this is.

1313
01:06:41,498 --> 01:06:42,366
Permanent.

1314
01:06:42,799 --> 01:06:43,767
Sully--

1315
01:06:44,101 --> 01:06:45,669
Mr. McCormack, thank you.

1316
01:06:45,702 --> 01:06:47,471
Please, take a seat.

1317
01:06:53,043 --> 01:06:55,079
- [Colin's boss]
So Colin, this here

1318
01:06:55,112 --> 01:06:57,347
is Mr. Hanson from legal.

1319
01:06:57,847 --> 01:06:59,983
Apparently we got
a situation here.

1320
01:07:04,921 --> 01:07:06,123
- Save it Al.

1321
01:07:08,358 --> 01:07:09,693
I quit.

1322
01:07:09,726 --> 01:07:10,994
- [Hanson] Mr. McCormack,
we're only proposing

1323
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:12,129
a suspension.

1324
01:07:12,796 --> 01:07:14,231
(doorbell buzzing)

1325
01:07:27,677 --> 01:07:29,045
- These are yours.

1326
01:07:29,913 --> 01:07:31,415
- Colin, you can keep
them if you want.

1327
01:07:31,448 --> 01:07:32,349
- No.

1328
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:35,819
- Come in?

1329
01:07:37,587 --> 01:07:38,555
Please.

1330
01:07:39,523 --> 01:07:40,424
I could use the company.

1331
01:07:40,457 --> 01:07:42,759
Packing is so fucking boring.

1332
01:07:46,396 --> 01:07:47,731
Do you want something to drink?

1333
01:07:49,266 --> 01:07:50,234
- Got any beer?

1334
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:54,338
- Oh, I can look.

1335
01:07:58,242 --> 01:08:00,043
Colin, I'm pretty
sure this bowl--

1336
01:08:00,310 --> 01:08:01,211
(door shutting)

1337
01:08:16,293 --> 01:08:18,662
* Where did you come from

1338
01:08:19,729 --> 01:08:22,432
* The moment we met

1339
01:08:23,367 --> 01:08:26,270
* You had me spinning

1340
01:08:26,970 --> 01:08:29,939
* When you took my hand

1341
01:08:30,707 --> 01:08:32,509
* Sound the alarms

1342
01:08:32,542 --> 01:08:34,278
* You caught me off guard

1343
01:08:34,311 --> 01:08:35,912
* As fast as you came

1344
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:37,814
* Then you were gone

1345
01:08:37,847 --> 01:08:39,549
* You string me along

1346
01:08:39,583 --> 01:08:44,020
* With your empty promises

1347
01:08:44,053 --> 01:08:49,025
* You just keep me hanging on

1348
01:08:51,228 --> 01:08:56,233
* You keep me hanging on

1349
01:08:58,535 --> 01:09:03,540
* You keep me hanging on

1350
01:09:05,575 --> 01:09:08,912
* You gotta let me go

1351
01:09:11,181 --> 01:09:16,186
* Just a hangman on your own

1352
01:09:20,624 --> 01:09:22,659
(phone vibrating)

1353
01:09:28,097 --> 01:09:29,699
* I can't breathe

1354
01:09:29,733 --> 01:09:31,368
* And I can't sleep

1355
01:09:31,401 --> 01:09:34,671
* You leave me here
and I'm wondering

1356
01:09:35,272 --> 01:09:38,575
* I don't know where
we stand anymore

1357
01:09:38,608 --> 01:09:40,109
* You're gone

1358
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:44,080
* You come to me

1359
01:09:44,113 --> 01:09:45,882
* You move away

1360
01:09:45,915 --> 01:09:47,351
* You're here last night

1361
01:09:47,384 --> 01:09:49,219
* But you're gone today

1362
01:09:49,686 --> 01:09:54,691
* You make me feel that it's
wrong for me to want more

1363
01:09:57,060 --> 01:10:00,497
* You tell me you miss
me and then wonder why

1364
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:02,666
* When I give you nothing
- [Voiceover] Are you okay?

1365
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:04,100
* I leave in a spot

1366
01:10:04,133 --> 01:10:05,869
* Well why should I

1367
01:10:05,902 --> 01:10:09,906
(indistinguishable singing)

1368
01:10:24,454 --> 01:10:25,722
(doorbell buzzing)

1369
01:10:26,189 --> 01:10:27,324
- [Mike] See what I mean folks,

1370
01:10:27,357 --> 01:10:29,025
these liberals have
no sense of humor.

1371
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:30,460
(door slamming)

1372
01:10:37,033 --> 01:10:38,468
- Colin, what the fuck.

1373
01:10:44,774 --> 01:10:46,075
Your voicemail is full.

1374
01:10:46,109 --> 01:10:47,711
You don't answer email.

1375
01:10:50,179 --> 01:10:51,315
Are you...

1376
01:10:56,353 --> 01:10:57,787
Colin, I don't know
what to do here.

1377
01:10:57,821 --> 01:10:59,756
- Nobody's asking
you to do anything.

1378
01:10:59,789 --> 01:11:01,325
Go back to L.A.

1379
01:11:25,949 --> 01:11:27,817
- So Tee's gotten
himself expelled.

1380
01:11:29,185 --> 01:11:30,854
Pills and some...

1381
01:11:32,356 --> 01:11:33,623
Altercations.

1382
01:11:44,601 --> 01:11:45,869
A social worker thinks he needs

1383
01:11:45,902 --> 01:11:47,136
some in-patient treatment

1384
01:11:47,170 --> 01:11:49,539
and I can't stomach
them shipping him off

1385
01:11:49,573 --> 01:11:52,108
to that whack job
grandfather so...

1386
01:11:55,211 --> 01:11:57,013
UCLA Medical has a program.

1387
01:11:58,782 --> 01:12:00,617
We're on the 6 o'clock
tomorrow morning.

1388
01:12:04,654 --> 01:12:06,423
- The way he would...

1389
01:12:07,524 --> 01:12:08,992
Look at me.

1390
01:12:13,229 --> 01:12:14,197
- What?

1391
01:12:15,432 --> 01:12:16,566
- He would...

1392
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:18,835
Look at me like...

1393
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:23,006
He wanted to consume me.

1394
01:12:24,641 --> 01:12:25,642
And I wanted that.

1395
01:12:25,675 --> 01:12:26,943
I wanted...

1396
01:12:28,044 --> 01:12:29,312
Something.

1397
01:12:31,548 --> 01:12:33,282
More, but I got it wrong.

1398
01:12:33,316 --> 01:12:34,551
He wanted a father.

1399
01:12:36,119 --> 01:12:37,821
He needed me to be a father.

1400
01:12:37,854 --> 01:12:38,622
And I made him--

1401
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:39,989
- Colin you didn't know.

1402
01:12:40,089 --> 01:12:41,224
- I knew it was wrong.

1403
01:12:41,257 --> 01:12:42,959
On some level I
knew it wasn't...

1404
01:12:43,159 --> 01:12:44,127
What he wanted.

1405
01:12:44,394 --> 01:12:45,695
- But he let happen.

1406
01:12:47,330 --> 01:12:49,466
And you can't take
that on yourself.

1407
01:12:57,641 --> 01:12:58,775
He made a choice.

1408
01:13:00,143 --> 01:13:01,511
He got scared

1409
01:13:01,545 --> 01:13:03,212
and he made a fucked up choice

1410
01:13:03,246 --> 01:13:04,648
that we are all
gonna have to find

1411
01:13:04,681 --> 01:13:06,115
some way to live with.

1412
01:13:07,751 --> 01:13:09,085
Especially Tee.

1413
01:13:09,218 --> 01:13:10,420
- Who are you?

1414
01:13:12,355 --> 01:13:13,256
I don't get it.

1415
01:13:13,289 --> 01:13:14,591
You're being so gentle with him.

1416
01:13:18,061 --> 01:13:19,228
- I don't know.

1417
01:13:21,364 --> 01:13:22,599
He's a good kid.

1418
01:13:24,701 --> 01:13:26,369
Incredibly fucked up but...

1419
01:13:30,173 --> 01:13:32,241
He's never had anyone looking
out for him, you know.

1420
01:13:34,277 --> 01:13:36,480
And I remember what
that felt like.

1421
01:13:38,515 --> 01:13:40,016
How alone I felt.

1422
01:13:45,989 --> 01:13:46,923
Anyway.

1423
01:13:51,227 --> 01:13:52,462
- Yup.

1424
01:13:55,298 --> 01:13:56,800
- Listen, I need to
make sure he's packed

1425
01:13:56,833 --> 01:13:58,267
and ready to go.

1426
01:13:59,335 --> 01:14:01,170
He's staying with me
at the hotel tonight.

1427
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:02,706
I know he'd love to see you.

1428
01:14:02,739 --> 01:14:03,673
- I can't.

1429
01:14:03,907 --> 01:14:05,008
- Colin, you have got to just--

1430
01:14:05,041 --> 01:14:06,075
- No I don't.

1431
01:14:06,109 --> 01:14:07,877
I really don't.

1432
01:14:13,917 --> 01:14:15,084
- You are--

1433
01:14:16,686 --> 01:14:17,954
You're unbelievable.

1434
01:14:19,422 --> 01:14:21,424
Not everything is
easy, you know, life.

1435
01:14:22,559 --> 01:14:24,961
I know you've managed
to go 40 odd years

1436
01:14:24,994 --> 01:14:26,796
without having to
face that little fact,

1437
01:14:26,830 --> 01:14:29,165
but I never expected this.

1438
01:14:30,166 --> 01:14:32,636
Things get shitty
and you just quit.

1439
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:35,404
Really?

1440
01:14:37,641 --> 01:14:38,975
Who are you?

1441
01:14:48,985 --> 01:14:50,486
(door slammed)

1442
01:15:48,011 --> 01:15:49,813
- [Mike] And of course
you can follow our columns

1443
01:15:49,846 --> 01:15:52,248
Tuesdays and Thursdays
in the Times Herald.

1444
01:15:52,281 --> 01:15:54,283
Until next time,
I'm Mike Steinman.

1445
01:15:54,317 --> 01:15:57,420
- And I'm Colin
McCormack on The Pulse.

1446
01:16:00,323 --> 01:16:02,626
And I'm Colin McCormack on The--

1447
01:16:03,827 --> 01:16:06,529
And I'm Colin
McCormack on The Pulse.

1448
01:16:09,565 --> 01:16:11,701
And I'm Colin McCormack.

1449
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:20,409
(uplifting guitar music)

1450
01:17:16,666 --> 01:17:19,135
- [Voicemail] Hey there,
this is Kin Cheng, KCLA News.

1451
01:17:19,168 --> 01:17:20,837
Listen, we were
impressed with your reel

1452
01:17:20,870 --> 01:17:22,471
and the timing couldn't
have been better.

1453
01:17:22,505 --> 01:17:23,973
We got something
coming up pretty quick.

1454
01:17:24,007 --> 01:17:25,474
So give me a call
as soon as possible

1455
01:17:25,508 --> 01:17:27,043
and I'll fill you
in on the details.

1456
01:17:27,076 --> 01:17:28,211
Okay.

1457
01:17:28,244 --> 01:17:29,012
I look forward to
talking to you.

1458
01:17:29,045 --> 01:17:31,881
My number is 323-526...

1459
01:17:56,605 --> 01:17:58,341
- Mr. McCormack?

1460
01:17:58,374 --> 01:18:01,177
Well, I've discussed
it with my colleagues.

1461
01:18:01,210 --> 01:18:02,645
- And?

1462
01:18:02,678 --> 01:18:04,848
- Well, frankly
a little heads up

1463
01:18:04,881 --> 01:18:06,916
would've been appreciated.

1464
01:18:06,950 --> 01:18:10,553
We'd like to really discuss
this with Tee before hand.

1465
01:18:11,154 --> 01:18:12,856
You understand this is...

1466
01:18:13,890 --> 01:18:15,091
Complicated?

1467
01:18:15,458 --> 01:18:16,259
- Yeah.

1468
01:18:18,494 --> 01:18:19,829
Yeah, it is.

1469
01:18:21,697 --> 01:18:24,033
- We have a group
session starting shortly.

1470
01:18:24,067 --> 01:18:25,835
I'll ask you to keep
it simple today.

1471
01:18:25,869 --> 01:18:29,572
Just, stick to the basics.

1472
01:18:29,605 --> 01:18:32,008
Just, reconnect.

1473
01:18:32,275 --> 01:18:34,377
And then perhaps you
can come back tomorrow

1474
01:18:34,410 --> 01:18:35,879
for a more in depth session.

1475
01:18:35,912 --> 01:18:36,980
Would that work?

1476
01:18:37,613 --> 01:18:38,948
- I'll follow your lead here.

1477
01:18:40,950 --> 01:18:42,018
- Thank you.

1478
01:18:43,119 --> 01:18:44,587
I'll be right back.

1479
01:19:10,146 --> 01:19:11,347
- You're here.

1480
01:19:14,951 --> 01:19:16,185
- I am.

1481
01:19:19,388 --> 01:19:20,824
- I'm glad.

1482
01:19:36,272 --> 01:19:37,773
(knock on door)

1483
01:19:39,742 --> 01:19:40,743
- Hello.

1484
01:19:41,144 --> 01:19:42,245
- Oh hi, is this--

1485
01:19:42,278 --> 01:19:43,379
- Are you looking for Stewart?

1486
01:19:43,412 --> 01:19:44,147
- Yeah.

1487
01:19:44,180 --> 01:19:45,148
- Can I tell him--

1488
01:19:45,548 --> 01:19:47,383
You're Colin right?

1489
01:19:47,716 --> 01:19:48,517
- I am.

1490
01:19:48,551 --> 01:19:49,618
You are...

1491
01:19:49,652 --> 01:19:50,486
- Paul, hi.

1492
01:19:50,887 --> 01:19:52,288
- Hey hon, who is it?

1493
01:19:55,124 --> 01:19:56,125
Well now.

1494
01:19:57,994 --> 01:19:58,928
- Surprised?

1495
01:19:59,595 --> 01:20:00,796
- You think?

1496
01:20:01,998 --> 01:20:03,032
Paul, this is Colin.

1497
01:20:03,066 --> 01:20:04,901
- I recognized him.

1498
01:20:05,601 --> 01:20:06,502
- He did.

1499
01:20:07,203 --> 01:20:08,371
- So...

1500
01:20:10,406 --> 01:20:13,076
- I'm not interrupting, am I?

1501
01:20:13,109 --> 01:20:14,543
- No no, not at all.

1502
01:20:14,577 --> 01:20:16,880
Actually, you are
saving me 'cause Stewart

1503
01:20:16,913 --> 01:20:18,781
is determined to make
me a basketball fan

1504
01:20:18,814 --> 01:20:21,084
and it is not taking.

1505
01:20:21,484 --> 01:20:22,518
- You're not trying.

1506
01:20:22,551 --> 01:20:23,853
- Whatever.

1507
01:20:23,987 --> 01:20:25,454
Listen, I should
really be working

1508
01:20:25,488 --> 01:20:26,856
on my lesson plans anyway.

1509
01:20:26,890 --> 01:20:29,258
So, why don't I leave
you two boys to catch up.

1510
01:20:30,093 --> 01:20:30,793
- You sure?

1511
01:20:30,826 --> 01:20:31,861
- Of course.

1512
01:20:31,895 --> 01:20:32,862
- Okay, thanks hon.

1513
01:20:32,896 --> 01:20:33,696
- Yeah.

1514
01:20:34,397 --> 01:20:35,164
- I'll call you later?

1515
01:20:35,198 --> 01:20:36,132
- That's perfect.

1516
01:20:37,166 --> 01:20:38,667
- It's nice to meet you.

1517
01:20:39,435 --> 01:20:40,536
- Likewise.

1518
01:20:54,483 --> 01:20:57,153
- So was that
History Department?

1519
01:21:00,789 --> 01:21:02,325
Seems like a good guy.

1520
01:21:03,126 --> 01:21:04,060
- He is.

1521
01:21:05,728 --> 01:21:06,795
- Does he live here, or?

1522
01:21:07,196 --> 01:21:08,431
- No, but...

1523
01:21:10,299 --> 01:21:12,101
He is a good guy.

1524
01:21:14,203 --> 01:21:17,573
- Oh my God.

1525
01:21:18,975 --> 01:21:20,209
- I know right

1526
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:32,855
So what are you doing here?

1527
01:21:36,592 --> 01:21:39,428
- I've been a jackass.

1528
01:21:40,163 --> 01:21:41,764
- I am not gonna argue.

1529
01:21:43,399 --> 01:21:44,433
You okay?

1530
01:21:46,970 --> 01:21:48,237
- Getting there.

1531
01:21:48,837 --> 01:21:49,805
Yeah.

1532
01:21:51,007 --> 01:21:52,041
- Good.

1533
01:21:54,777 --> 01:21:55,945
Tee's doing better.

1534
01:21:55,979 --> 01:21:57,080
I can get you the
number of the--

1535
01:21:57,113 --> 01:21:58,347
- I already saw him.

1536
01:21:59,282 --> 01:22:00,416
We're gonna--

1537
01:22:03,052 --> 01:22:04,920
Keep talking.

1538
01:22:14,097 --> 01:22:15,398
Stewart,

1539
01:22:21,104 --> 01:22:24,207
Why did, why did you
move to Pittsburgh?

1540
01:22:28,177 --> 01:22:30,679
- Jesus Colin, it was
15 years ago, I can't--

1541
01:22:30,713 --> 01:22:31,714
- Stewart.

1542
01:22:32,915 --> 01:22:34,617
- That's where the job was.

1543
01:22:41,324 --> 01:22:43,192
Okay, no.

1544
01:22:46,729 --> 01:22:49,265
The shit storm at
Georgetown wore me out.

1545
01:22:52,101 --> 01:22:54,003
And I missed my friend.

1546
01:23:01,210 --> 01:23:02,545
- I missed you too.

1547
01:23:05,514 --> 01:23:08,117
I know I never said that.

1548
01:23:08,284 --> 01:23:09,652
- We're masters at
not saying things.

1549
01:23:09,685 --> 01:23:10,886
- We're pathetic.

1550
01:23:10,919 --> 01:23:12,988
I'm pathetic.

1551
01:23:15,891 --> 01:23:17,226
So let me--

1552
01:23:17,993 --> 01:23:18,994
Say this.

1553
01:23:25,101 --> 01:23:27,203
Having you in my life

1554
01:23:28,537 --> 01:23:30,673
has meant the world to me.

1555
01:23:32,675 --> 01:23:33,709
You,

1556
01:23:35,311 --> 01:23:38,314
you are my family.

1557
01:23:45,954 --> 01:23:48,691
- You bastard, you know
I feel the same way.

1558
01:23:50,326 --> 01:23:51,794
Our son had some issues.

1559
01:23:52,095 --> 01:23:54,163
(laughing)

1560
01:24:00,536 --> 01:24:03,372
- So I got a meeting with
the CW affiliate here.

1561
01:24:05,908 --> 01:24:07,676
They're looking for
a weekend anchor.

1562
01:24:10,113 --> 01:24:13,549
You think I might
like California?

1563
01:24:16,185 --> 01:24:18,754
- Yeah, I do.

1564
01:24:19,155 --> 01:24:20,189
- I do?

1565
01:24:21,524 --> 01:24:22,925
What, are we married now?

1566
01:24:22,958 --> 01:24:24,059
- Oh, shut it.

1567
01:24:25,294 --> 01:24:26,662
I'm spoken for.

1568
01:24:30,766 --> 01:24:33,202
- [Sport's announcer]
How about that one?

1569
01:24:33,236 --> 01:24:34,803
He looked like a freight
train out of control

1570
01:24:34,837 --> 01:24:36,339
but it was all net.

1571
01:24:36,372 --> 01:24:37,640
Wow.

1572
01:24:37,673 --> 01:24:38,774
One of the highlights
of the night so far.

1573
01:24:38,807 --> 01:24:40,509
And there have been
plenty of them.

1574
01:24:40,543 --> 01:24:41,744
Fantastic.

1575
01:24:42,911 --> 01:24:44,313
In case you missed
it, the Tigers...

1576
01:24:48,917 --> 01:24:51,254
- [Colin] I feel old.

1577
01:24:53,356 --> 01:24:54,757
- [Stewart] Yeah.

1578
01:24:57,193 --> 01:24:58,661
- [Colin] Well.

1579
01:25:02,198 --> 01:25:04,200
(soft rock music)
