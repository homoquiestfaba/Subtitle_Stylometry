1
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,138
The forests of Pandora...

2
00:01:28,897 --> 00:01:30,217
hold many dangers.

3
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:38,046
But the most dangerous thing...

4
00:01:38,127 --> 00:01:38,965
about Pandora...

5
00:01:43,601 --> 00:01:45,758
is that you may grow
to love her too much.

6
00:01:58,183 --> 00:02:00,100
We sing the songcords to remember.

7
00:02:01,102 --> 00:02:02,060
Each bead...

8
00:02:02,779 --> 00:02:03,697
a story in our life.

9
00:02:05,975 --> 00:02:07,652
A bead for the
birth of our son.

10
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:13,488
Neteyam!

11
00:02:14,286 --> 00:02:15,365
Neteyam!

12
00:02:22,398 --> 00:02:23,037
A bead...

13
00:02:23,116 --> 00:02:25,234
when we adopted
our daughter, Kiri.

14
00:02:26,873 --> 00:02:28,272
Born of Grace's avatar.

15
00:02:29,469 --> 00:02:31,626
A daughter whose
conception was a total mystery.

16
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:46,489
A bead...

17
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:47,889
for the first
communion with Eywa.

18
00:02:51,764 --> 00:02:53,085
The People say...

19
00:02:53,244 --> 00:02:54,042
we live in Eywa...

20
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:57,678
and Eywa lives in us.

21
00:03:00,436 --> 00:03:01,911
The Great Mother...

22
00:03:02,031 --> 00:03:03,231
holds all her children...

23
00:03:03,311 --> 00:03:04,071
in her heart.

24
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,022
Happiness is simple.

25
00:03:16,258 --> 00:03:18,415
But who would've thought a
jarhead like me could crack the code?

26
00:03:22,249 --> 00:03:24,328
When I first met your father...

27
00:03:24,848 --> 00:03:26,086
...I was trying to kill him.

28
00:03:26,366 --> 00:03:28,322
It was love at first sight.

29
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:29,961
Before I knew it, we had four.

30
00:03:34,078 --> 00:03:36,036
When we sent the Sky
People back to Earth...

31
00:03:36,197 --> 00:03:37,673
a few of 'em stayed.

32
00:03:38,272 --> 00:03:40,032
Science guys,
loyal to the Na'vi.

33
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,027
And then there was Spider.

34
00:03:43,904 --> 00:03:44,983
He was just stuck here.

35
00:03:45,104 --> 00:03:46,623
Too young for a cryo-capsule.

36
00:03:47,182 --> 00:03:48,339
You little wild man.

37
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:49,099
See you, Norm!

38
00:03:49,219 --> 00:03:49,978
Orphaned by the war...

39
00:03:50,098 --> 00:03:51,217
he was raised by the lab guys.

40
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:52,215
Spider, take your spare!

41
00:03:52,336 --> 00:03:53,735
I'm just going to the village!

42
00:03:55,172 --> 00:03:56,772
He wasn't part of our family.

43
00:03:56,933 --> 00:03:58,090
He was like a stray cat.

44
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,169
Just always around.

45
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:02,606
Inseparable from our kids.

46
00:04:06,321 --> 00:04:07,520
To Neytiri...

47
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:08,877
he would always be alien.

48
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:10,675
One of them.

49
00:04:11,197 --> 00:04:13,593
He belongs with his own kind.

50
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:18,908
It's mine!

51
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:19,985
I had it first.

52
00:04:20,347 --> 00:04:21,746
Why should I let you have it?

53
00:04:21,826 --> 00:04:22,984
Took a few years to get the
language through my thick skull.

54
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,339
But now when I hear it...

55
00:04:26,498 --> 00:04:27,419
it might as well be English.

56
00:04:27,858 --> 00:04:28,817
I hate you!

57
00:04:29,614 --> 00:04:32,053
Well, I hate you
times infinity, Lo'ak!

58
00:04:32,293 --> 00:04:33,250
Penis face!

59
00:04:33,371 --> 00:04:35,168
Hey! Hey!
That's enough.

60
00:04:35,727 --> 00:04:37,245
Don't make me
come over there.

61
00:04:37,405 --> 00:04:39,724
He's gonna come out
from behind those big rocks.

62
00:04:39,883 --> 00:04:41,042
There he is.

63
00:04:43,801 --> 00:04:44,879
There you go.
Go get it!

64
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:45,636
Yeah!

65
00:04:47,075 --> 00:04:48,834
Hey, Neteyam,
the mighty fisherman.

66
00:04:49,313 --> 00:04:50,272
There you go. Good boy.

67
00:04:54,548 --> 00:04:55,626
Wow, that's a big one.

68
00:04:55,786 --> 00:04:56,744
By the rocks.

69
00:04:58,024 --> 00:04:58,984
Right where you said.

70
00:04:59,823 --> 00:05:00,781
How tall is he?

71
00:05:00,939 --> 00:05:02,698
-He's... that tall.
-He's tall!

72
00:05:02,857 --> 00:05:03,977
Goes by too fast.

73
00:05:04,657 --> 00:05:05,616
Like a dream.

74
00:05:07,212 --> 00:05:08,491
-Kiri.
-Bro, come on.

75
00:05:08,651 --> 00:05:09,611
Come on.

76
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:11,608
Smile, skxawng.

77
00:05:12,648 --> 00:05:13,887
Happiness is simple.

78
00:05:17,203 --> 00:05:18,162
Like date night.

79
00:05:18,682 --> 00:05:19,962
Time away from the kids.

80
00:05:50,323 --> 00:05:52,083
But the thing
about happiness...

81
00:05:54,481 --> 00:05:55,799
it can vanish
in a heartbeat.

82
00:06:02,192 --> 00:06:03,791
A new star in the night.

83
00:06:05,588 --> 00:06:06,867
It could only mean one thing.

84
00:06:13,976 --> 00:06:16,174
Ships. Decelerating.

85
00:06:24,846 --> 00:06:26,443
And Sky People returning.

86
00:08:39,736 --> 00:08:43,570
ONE YEAR LATER

87
00:08:50,325 --> 00:08:51,962
Pulse 168.

88
00:08:52,122 --> 00:08:53,121
Yeah, here it comes.

89
00:08:53,281 --> 00:08:54,240
You're just fine.

90
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:55,798
Just lie still.

91
00:08:56,276 --> 00:08:57,235
Stay calm.

92
00:08:59,114 --> 00:09:01,271
Yep. Pupillary
reflex is good.

93
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,550
Get that out of his face.

94
00:09:03,028 --> 00:09:03,669
Colonel...

95
00:09:04,587 --> 00:09:05,267
can you hear me?

96
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:06,226
Colonel?

97
00:09:09,384 --> 00:09:10,622
You need to lie
back down, sir.

98
00:09:15,816 --> 00:09:16,933
Sedate him!
Sedate him!

99
00:09:17,173 --> 00:09:18,012
Get outta here.

100
00:09:18,571 --> 00:09:19,210
Go, go, go!

101
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:20,132
Get security!

102
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:21,249
-Grab him!
-Grab him!

103
00:09:22,526 --> 00:09:23,367
Hold him!

104
00:09:23,447 --> 00:09:24,165
Calm down!

105
00:09:24,245 --> 00:09:25,205
Colonel, stand down!

106
00:09:25,444 --> 00:09:26,085
Colonel...

107
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:26,804
it's me!

108
00:09:27,204 --> 00:09:28,162
Corporal Wainfleet!

109
00:09:31,918 --> 00:09:32,877
Lyle?

110
00:09:34,474 --> 00:09:35,435
That you?

111
00:09:35,873 --> 00:09:38,229
Yes, sir.
And Z Dog.

112
00:09:39,469 --> 00:09:40,428
And Fike.

113
00:09:43,742 --> 00:09:44,901
I'm all right.
Let me go.

114
00:09:45,662 --> 00:09:46,620
I'm all right.

115
00:10:07,118 --> 00:10:08,037
Well...

116
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:11,034
ain't this a bitch.

117
00:10:20,023 --> 00:10:23,979
Stand by. Two minutes to
Pandora insertion. Secure for Delta V.

118
00:10:25,936 --> 00:10:27,256
All right. Umbilical's clear.

119
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,574
Pulse ox 89.

120
00:10:31,092 --> 00:10:34,569
In case you haven't figured it
out yet, you're Colonel Miles Quaritch.

121
00:10:34,728 --> 00:10:37,244
Only younger,
taller, bluer...

122
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:38,843
and not nearly
as good-lookin'.

123
00:10:39,881 --> 00:10:41,519
In two hours,
I fly a mission...

124
00:10:41,598 --> 00:10:43,357
against the
Na'vi's stronghold.

125
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:48,071
The powers that be thought it prudent
that I do this backup just in case.

126
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:50,269
And if you are
watchin' it, well...

127
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:52,426
it means that I did
get my ticket punched.

128
00:10:54,546 --> 00:10:55,544
Hey, Parker...

129
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:57,582
just what the hell am I
supposed to say now?

130
00:10:58,061 --> 00:10:59,540
Just remind him
how this works.

131
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,418
Here.

132
00:11:01,777 --> 00:11:04,375
So see this? This is all your
memories and your personality.

133
00:11:04,535 --> 00:11:05,693
We're gonna send
this back to Earth...

134
00:11:05,853 --> 00:11:08,169
where you're growing
in a lab as we speak.

135
00:11:08,329 --> 00:11:09,768
We're gonna imprint
you with it, and then...

136
00:11:09,848 --> 00:11:10,568
Hey, hey, hey.

137
00:11:10,648 --> 00:11:12,245
Am I doin' this,
or are you doin' this?

138
00:11:12,325 --> 00:11:13,284
Hurry it up.
Hurry it up.

139
00:11:13,804 --> 00:11:15,203
Anyway,
the idea...

140
00:11:15,283 --> 00:11:18,918
is to get the minds of the
saltiest on-world operators.

141
00:11:19,077 --> 00:11:22,156
Yeah, like Corporal
Wainfleet over there...

142
00:11:22,873 --> 00:11:24,829
and your humble
narrator into...

143
00:11:25,031 --> 00:11:26,510
recombinant bodies.

144
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:28,665
You're a
recom now, Colonel...

145
00:11:28,786 --> 00:11:31,184
loaded with my
memories and my charm.

146
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,941
What you won't
remember is my death...

147
00:11:34,141 --> 00:11:35,380
because it
hasn't happened yet...

148
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,058
and it ain't gonna.

149
00:11:37,218 --> 00:11:38,495
-Damn right.
-Hell yeah.

150
00:11:39,094 --> 00:11:40,174
Well, whatever happened...

151
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,248
if you're any clone of mine, you'll
be lookin' for some payback.

152
00:11:44,447 --> 00:11:46,607
And Jake Sully would be
at the top of that list.

153
00:11:50,321 --> 00:11:51,282
Remember, kid...

154
00:11:51,921 --> 00:11:53,399
a Marine
can't be defeated.

155
00:11:54,158 --> 00:11:55,238
Oh, you can kill us...

156
00:11:56,037 --> 00:11:57,595
but we'll just
regroup in hell.

157
00:11:59,073 --> 00:12:00,033
Semper fi.

158
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,719
Ground team, go!

159
00:13:20,423 --> 00:13:21,622
Take this! Go!

160
00:13:26,297 --> 00:13:27,734
Let's go. Two
minutes, people. Let's go.

161
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,766
Bro, we have got
to get down there.

162
00:13:34,287 --> 00:13:35,926
No way!
Dad will skin us!

163
00:13:36,085 --> 00:13:37,724
Come on.
Don't be a wuss.

164
00:13:38,243 --> 00:13:39,082
Lo'ak!

165
00:13:39,322 --> 00:13:40,600
Get back
here, you...

166
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:44,716
Taking the
whole case!

167
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:46,355
We're taking mags,
the RPGs, the stingers.

168
00:13:50,548 --> 00:13:51,707
Bro, let's go. Come on!

169
00:13:52,147 --> 00:13:52,946
Okay, let's go!

170
00:13:54,943 --> 00:13:55,901
Move! Take that!

171
00:13:56,743 --> 00:13:57,382
Take these weapons.

172
00:13:57,501 --> 00:13:58,181
Here, boy. Go!

173
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:01,777
You don't even
know how to use it.

174
00:14:03,256 --> 00:14:04,453
Dad taught me.

175
00:14:12,122 --> 00:14:12,923
Gunship's
inbound!

176
00:14:20,514 --> 00:14:21,473
Bro, come on!

177
00:14:31,301 --> 00:14:32,540
Lo'ak, where are you?

178
00:14:32,661 --> 00:14:33,380
Neteyam!

179
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:35,896
Easy, easy, you okay?

180
00:14:36,096 --> 00:14:37,535
-Yeah.
-Where's your brother?

181
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,334
-That way.
-Where is he? Where?

182
00:14:39,454 --> 00:14:40,252
Get outta here!

183
00:14:40,332 --> 00:14:40,972
Go on!

184
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:43,090
Neteyam!

185
00:14:45,449 --> 00:14:46,406
Oh, no.

186
00:14:48,364 --> 00:14:50,004
Oh, no, no, no.

187
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:51,680
Oh, God.

188
00:14:56,673 --> 00:14:57,631
Dad?

189
00:15:00,509 --> 00:15:02,428
What are you doin' here, boy?
What the hell were you thinkin'?

190
00:15:03,467 --> 00:15:04,425
I'm sorry.

191
00:15:06,264 --> 00:15:07,262
I'm sorry, sir.

192
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,335
We are not in Kansas anymore.

193
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,092
We are going to Pandora.

194
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:18,290
Now...

195
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:22,125
I know you're all askin'
yourselves the same question.

196
00:15:25,002 --> 00:15:26,083
Why so blue?

197
00:15:30,357 --> 00:15:31,757
For our sins
in our past life...

198
00:15:31,957 --> 00:15:32,756
we have been
brought back...

199
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:35,072
in the form
of our enemy.

200
00:15:35,191 --> 00:15:38,947
That gives us their size,
their strength, their speed.

201
00:15:39,346 --> 00:15:41,266
And with
our training...

202
00:15:41,665 --> 00:15:43,103
that's a pretty
potent mix.

203
00:15:44,901 --> 00:15:46,100
Do we have a
mission yet?

204
00:15:46,219 --> 00:15:47,379
Indeed
we do.

205
00:15:48,298 --> 00:15:50,653
Our mission is to
hunt down and kill...

206
00:15:50,893 --> 00:15:52,653
the leader of the
Na'vi insurgency.

207
00:15:53,491 --> 00:15:56,486
The one they call
Toruk Makto.

208
00:15:57,167 --> 00:15:58,325
Jake Sully.

209
00:15:58,525 --> 00:15:59,403
Yeah!

210
00:16:06,876 --> 00:16:08,315
Attack, attack!

211
00:16:09,195 --> 00:16:10,392
Got ya!

212
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:11,271
Tuk!

213
00:16:11,391 --> 00:16:12,029
Come on!

214
00:16:12,431 --> 00:16:13,949
I'm definitely faster
when I'm blue.

215
00:16:14,108 --> 00:16:15,066
Skxawng.

216
00:16:15,185 --> 00:16:16,185
No, seriously.

217
00:16:16,264 --> 00:16:17,263
And the animals
respect me more.

218
00:16:17,423 --> 00:16:18,942
They don't think
of me as human.

219
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,740
Wait.
You're human?

220
00:16:30,452 --> 00:16:31,409
They're
coming!

221
00:16:31,929 --> 00:16:35,205
HIGH CAMP, OMATIKAYA STRONGHOLD

222
00:16:36,442 --> 00:16:37,360
They're coming!

223
00:16:37,481 --> 00:16:38,440
Kiri, Spider!

224
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,399
The war party's coming back!

225
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:41,835
Come on, come on.

226
00:16:41,996 --> 00:16:43,234
Let's go, come on.

227
00:16:57,299 --> 00:16:58,298
-Mom!
-Tuk...

228
00:16:58,457 --> 00:16:59,976
-Mom.
-Tuk, Tuk, Tuk.

229
00:17:02,173 --> 00:17:02,933
Fall in.

230
00:17:05,572 --> 00:17:07,049
You're supposed to be spotters.

231
00:17:07,129 --> 00:17:08,807
You spot bogeys, and you call 'em in.

232
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:09,966
From a distance!

233
00:17:10,367 --> 00:17:12,085
Does any of this sound familiar?
Get here!

234
00:17:12,763 --> 00:17:14,560
Jesus. I let you two
geniuses fly a mission...

235
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:16,320
and you disobey direct orders.

236
00:17:17,159 --> 00:17:19,515
Kiri, can you go help your
grandmother with the wounded? Please?

237
00:17:19,676 --> 00:17:20,635
My brother is wounded.

238
00:17:21,074 --> 00:17:21,752
It's fine.

239
00:17:21,913 --> 00:17:23,470
-Tuk, go with her. Go.
-Dad.

240
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:25,467
Sir. I take full responsibility.

241
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:26,306
Yeah, you do.

242
00:17:26,387 --> 00:17:27,106
That's right.

243
00:17:27,386 --> 00:17:29,903
'Cause you're the older
brother. You gotta act like it.

244
00:17:30,942 --> 00:17:32,021
MaJake.

245
00:17:32,502 --> 00:17:34,138
Your son is actually bleeding.

246
00:17:34,298 --> 00:17:35,737
Mother, it's fine. I...

247
00:17:37,815 --> 00:17:39,651
Just go and get patched up.
Go on, dismissed.

248
00:17:45,086 --> 00:17:47,923
You do understand that you
almost got your brother killed.

249
00:17:48,403 --> 00:17:49,362
Yes, sir.

250
00:17:51,598 --> 00:17:53,117
You're grounded.
No flying for a month.

251
00:17:53,878 --> 00:17:55,595
Now, see to the ikran.
All of 'em.

252
00:17:55,873 --> 00:17:56,593
Yes, sir.

253
00:17:56,714 --> 00:17:58,153
And get that crap off your face.

254
00:18:06,942 --> 00:18:08,661
Aw, want a kiss on the boo-boo?

255
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,780
-Give him this.
-Okay.

256
00:18:09,979 --> 00:18:11,378
I would use yalna bark.

257
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:12,177
Here, drink.

258
00:18:12,256 --> 00:18:12,938
Oh, you would?

259
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,735
And who is Tsahik?

260
00:18:15,174 --> 00:18:16,291
You are, Grand... Move!

261
00:18:16,811 --> 00:18:19,049
You are, Grandmother.
But yalna bark is better.

262
00:18:21,405 --> 00:18:22,565
It stings less.

263
00:18:23,043 --> 00:18:24,362
Mighty Warrior.

264
00:18:31,874 --> 00:18:32,993
What?

265
00:18:35,312 --> 00:18:37,388
Neteyam and Lo'ak
try to live up to you.

266
00:18:39,147 --> 00:18:40,305
It is very hard on them.

267
00:18:42,022 --> 00:18:43,101
I know.

268
00:18:45,258 --> 00:18:47,295
You are very hard on them.

269
00:18:49,893 --> 00:18:51,692
I'm their father.
It's my job.

270
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:55,170
This is not a squad.

271
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:56,768
It is a family.

272
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:08,992
I thought we'd lost them.

273
00:19:17,545 --> 00:19:18,542
Hey, man.
How's it going?

274
00:19:18,661 --> 00:19:19,500
Hey, Spider.

275
00:19:20,019 --> 00:19:21,339
Your ass is mine.

276
00:19:21,499 --> 00:19:22,338
I'm right here.

277
00:19:23,098 --> 00:19:24,215
Avatars only...

278
00:19:24,295 --> 00:19:24,974
go around!

279
00:19:25,573 --> 00:19:26,493
Sorry.

280
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:29,089
Yeah. Those blue stripes
don't make you any bigger, bro.

281
00:19:29,848 --> 00:19:31,288
Yeah, well, I can still kick your ass.

282
00:19:34,724 --> 00:19:35,683
Hell of a day.

283
00:19:35,803 --> 00:19:36,763
Long run.

284
00:19:39,798 --> 00:19:41,116
Real hysterical, guys.

285
00:19:41,277 --> 00:19:42,637
You know what really sucks though?

286
00:19:42,756 --> 00:19:43,915
Is you can breathe Earth air for hours...

287
00:19:44,035 --> 00:19:46,510
and I can only breathe
your air for, like, 10 seconds.

288
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:48,948
Yeah, Monkey Boy,
that really sucks.

289
00:19:49,109 --> 00:19:50,066
For you.

290
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:58,259
-Hi, Max.
-Hey, kids.

291
00:19:58,338 --> 00:19:59,019
Hey. What's up, Max?

292
00:19:59,737 --> 00:20:00,376
What's up, Norm?

293
00:20:06,167 --> 00:20:07,008
Hi, Ma.

294
00:20:17,277 --> 00:20:19,794
Maybe I'm just losing it out here...

295
00:20:19,914 --> 00:20:21,631
but I'm seeing real evidence...

296
00:20:21,751 --> 00:20:25,308
of a systemic response on a global level.

297
00:20:25,986 --> 00:20:27,064
I can't...

298
00:20:28,303 --> 00:20:31,100
I won't use the term "intelligence." It's...

299
00:20:32,139 --> 00:20:34,136
maybe "awareness" is a better word.

300
00:20:34,977 --> 00:20:38,813
It's like the entire biosphere of Pandora...

301
00:20:38,892 --> 00:20:40,171
is aware...

302
00:20:40,332 --> 00:20:43,327
and capable of this cognitive response.

303
00:20:44,925 --> 00:20:46,285
Oh, crap,
I can't say that.

304
00:20:47,201 --> 00:20:48,201
They'll crucify me.

305
00:20:48,841 --> 00:20:49,761
I mean, I need to say...

306
00:20:50,598 --> 00:20:52,516
So who do you think
knocked her up?

307
00:20:53,475 --> 00:20:54,435
Pretty sure it was Norm.

308
00:20:54,595 --> 00:20:55,554
Totally.

309
00:20:57,192 --> 00:20:58,871
You do not deserve to live.

310
00:20:59,071 --> 00:21:00,270
No, no, no.
Think about it, right?

311
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:01,749
I mean, he's the teacher's pet.

312
00:21:01,868 --> 00:21:03,225
He's out at the lab
with her all the time.

313
00:21:03,504 --> 00:21:05,223
I would kill myself.

314
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:06,742
I would drink acid.

315
00:21:06,862 --> 00:21:08,777
Bro, you're right.
He's, like, in every shot.

316
00:21:08,857 --> 00:21:11,016
Bro, look, look,
he's giving her looks.

317
00:21:11,217 --> 00:21:12,175
Hey.

318
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,292
See, I'm thinkin'...

319
00:21:14,491 --> 00:21:17,049
their two avatars were out
in the woods all alone...

320
00:21:17,649 --> 00:21:18,408
Gross!

321
00:21:18,567 --> 00:21:19,287
Guys.

322
00:21:19,407 --> 00:21:22,045
I mean, sometimes it's not
so great to know who your father was.

323
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,559
Whatever.

324
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:29,395
Don't even remember him.

325
00:21:29,794 --> 00:21:30,755
No, Spider.

326
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,632
-Dude.
-Spider...

327
00:21:34,868 --> 00:21:36,268
You are not him.

328
00:21:44,978 --> 00:21:47,616
BRIDGEHEAD CITY

329
00:22:15,185 --> 00:22:17,700
Go, go, go!
Directly inside the terminal.

330
00:22:17,781 --> 00:22:18,780
Do not stop.

331
00:22:23,297 --> 00:22:24,216
Masks off.

332
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:29,810
Sir...

333
00:22:29,929 --> 00:22:31,208
this is the General.

334
00:22:40,637 --> 00:22:41,995
General Ardmore.

335
00:22:43,033 --> 00:22:44,353
Good to meet you, Colonel.

336
00:22:45,034 --> 00:22:46,272
I've heard good things...

337
00:22:46,951 --> 00:22:48,866
but a lot's changed
since your last tour here.

338
00:22:49,105 --> 00:22:49,906
Walk with me.

339
00:22:52,741 --> 00:22:54,859
The new ops
center is over here.

340
00:22:55,019 --> 00:22:56,138
That just came online.

341
00:22:56,897 --> 00:22:59,773
These Swarm Assemblers,
they can put up a building in six days.

342
00:23:00,852 --> 00:23:04,409
We have done more here in a year
than in the previous 30 years.

343
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:07,768
We're not here to run a mine, Colonel.

344
00:23:08,325 --> 00:23:09,444
As On-World Commander...

345
00:23:09,565 --> 00:23:11,282
I have been charged
with a greater mission.

346
00:23:16,516 --> 00:23:17,554
Earth is dying.

347
00:23:18,872 --> 00:23:21,871
Our task here is to tame this frontier.

348
00:23:22,829 --> 00:23:24,668
Nothing less than to make Pandora...

349
00:23:24,747 --> 00:23:25,906
the new home for humanity.

350
00:23:27,505 --> 00:23:29,463
But before we can do that...

351
00:23:29,622 --> 00:23:31,701
we need to pacify the hostiles.

352
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:37,414
Sully's raids are becoming
bolder and more frequent.

353
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,849
His strikes are well-planned.

354
00:23:40,008 --> 00:23:42,565
He's got tight coordination
between his ground and air assets.

355
00:23:43,526 --> 00:23:47,242
His forces are hitting our
outlying sites. The mines, pipelines...

356
00:23:47,403 --> 00:23:48,921
cutting off our supply chain.

357
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,637
And they hit a maglev two days ago.

358
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:57,830
Any intel on Sully's...

359
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:59,068
base of operations?

360
00:23:59,268 --> 00:24:00,427
Yeah.
Give me the mountains.

361
00:24:02,345 --> 00:24:05,182
It's a cave system in the
Hallelujah Mountains somewhere.

362
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:10,057
But every time we send our
forces up there, we take losses.

363
00:24:11,536 --> 00:24:14,052
Our hardware really
stirs up the hornet's nest.

364
00:24:15,211 --> 00:24:16,968
We only get 10 minutes
in enemy airspace...

365
00:24:17,087 --> 00:24:18,527
they are all over us.

366
00:24:21,483 --> 00:24:22,443
Colonel...

367
00:24:22,562 --> 00:24:25,399
we believe your Blue Team will
be perceived as indigenous...

368
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,198
and will not trigger...

369
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:28,036
the immune response.

370
00:24:28,237 --> 00:24:30,914
And how might we test
that hypothesis, General?

371
00:24:31,912 --> 00:24:32,951
The hard way.

372
00:24:34,749 --> 00:24:35,828
Outstanding.

373
00:24:49,014 --> 00:24:50,573
We're entering hostile airspace.

374
00:24:51,291 --> 00:24:52,291
Copy that.

375
00:25:01,879 --> 00:25:03,755
-Bro!
-Go, Monkey Boy!

376
00:25:03,915 --> 00:25:05,993
Guys, wait up!

377
00:25:41,275 --> 00:25:42,792
Tuk!
Keep up!

378
00:25:43,431 --> 00:25:44,709
Okay, okay.

379
00:25:44,868 --> 00:25:46,148
Bro, why'd you bring her anyway?

380
00:25:46,747 --> 00:25:47,786
She's such a cry baby.

381
00:25:48,347 --> 00:25:50,343
She's all, "I'm telling."

382
00:25:50,464 --> 00:25:51,223
"You're not supposed
to go to the battlefield."

383
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,143
"I'll tell Mom if you
don't let me come."

384
00:25:53,262 --> 00:25:54,422
Don't pick on her.

385
00:25:56,339 --> 00:25:57,297
Come on.

386
00:25:58,657 --> 00:25:59,774
Oh, sick!

387
00:26:01,052 --> 00:26:02,332
Are there any
dead bodies up there?

388
00:26:02,929 --> 00:26:04,169
Bro, check it out.
Come on.

389
00:26:46,682 --> 00:26:47,639
No shit.

390
00:26:57,591 --> 00:26:59,068
Kiri.

391
00:26:59,467 --> 00:27:00,467
Kiri.

392
00:27:03,342 --> 00:27:04,301
Kiri...

393
00:27:04,701 --> 00:27:05,659
Kiri, hey.

394
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:06,779
Hey.

395
00:27:11,693 --> 00:27:12,652
Are you okay?

396
00:27:13,691 --> 00:27:15,848
I was doing that
thing again, wasn't I?

397
00:27:16,249 --> 00:27:17,968
Yeah, you were.

398
00:27:18,767 --> 00:27:19,724
Kiri!

399
00:27:19,844 --> 00:27:21,803
-Kiri!
-Kiri, we have to get back.

400
00:27:22,003 --> 00:27:22,961
All right, come on.

401
00:27:28,075 --> 00:27:29,153
What is it?

402
00:27:29,992 --> 00:27:32,031
We're always supposed
to be home by eclipse.

403
00:27:34,588 --> 00:27:36,387
It's way too big for a human.

404
00:27:36,506 --> 00:27:37,866
-Avatars?
-Maybe...

405
00:27:38,864 --> 00:27:40,661
but they're for sure not ours.

406
00:27:42,341 --> 00:27:43,300
What are you doing?

407
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:44,699
I'm tracking.

408
00:28:03,156 --> 00:28:04,117
Watch your six.

409
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,069
Clear.

410
00:28:12,184 --> 00:28:12,983
Perimeter up.

411
00:28:25,732 --> 00:28:26,691
Damn.

412
00:28:48,267 --> 00:28:49,942
We are never supposed to come here.

413
00:28:51,461 --> 00:28:52,701
Dad is going to ground you.

414
00:28:53,139 --> 00:28:54,018
Can you stop?

415
00:28:54,139 --> 00:28:54,896
For life.

416
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:57,255
Bro, we have got to
check this out.

417
00:28:57,535 --> 00:28:58,334
Let's go.

418
00:29:15,155 --> 00:29:16,114
Bro...

419
00:29:16,674 --> 00:29:18,073
that's where your dad and my dad...

420
00:29:18,911 --> 00:29:19,871
fought.

421
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,991
That's your dad's actual suit.

422
00:29:22,709 --> 00:29:24,147
Holy shit.

423
00:29:25,304 --> 00:29:26,623
Lyle, see if you can...

424
00:29:26,944 --> 00:29:28,621
pull some data
off that dash cam.

425
00:29:29,578 --> 00:29:31,456
That thing's deader
than shit, Colonel.

426
00:29:31,617 --> 00:29:32,377
So were we.

427
00:29:32,496 --> 00:29:33,176
All right.

428
00:29:34,135 --> 00:29:35,092
I gotta call this in.

429
00:29:35,253 --> 00:29:36,611
No, bro, we're gonna
get in trouble.

430
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:37,730
Let's go.

431
00:29:42,127 --> 00:29:44,565
Devil Dog, Devil Dog,
this is Eagle Eye, over.

432
00:29:45,043 --> 00:29:46,680
Eagle Eye.
Send your traffic.

433
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,159
I got eyes on some guys.

434
00:29:49,278 --> 00:29:51,792
They look like avatars...

435
00:29:52,032 --> 00:29:54,032
but they're in full camo
and carrying ARs.

436
00:29:54,711 --> 00:29:56,948
There's six of them.
Over.

437
00:29:57,107 --> 00:29:58,268
What's your pos?
Over.

438
00:30:00,504 --> 00:30:01,704
We're at the old shack.

439
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:05,700
Who's "we"?

440
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:08,536
Me, Spider, Kiri...

441
00:30:10,255 --> 00:30:11,254
and Tuk.

442
00:30:16,526 --> 00:30:18,284
Son, you listen to
me very carefully.

443
00:30:18,444 --> 00:30:19,405
You pull back right now.

444
00:30:19,523 --> 00:30:20,403
Do not make a sound.

445
00:30:20,603 --> 00:30:21,842
You get the hell out of there.

446
00:30:21,961 --> 00:30:22,680
Move! You copy?

447
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:23,958
Yes, sir, moving out.

448
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:24,680
See, I told you!

449
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:25,399
Go, go.

450
00:30:26,238 --> 00:30:27,235
Dad...

451
00:30:27,555 --> 00:30:28,753
I know a quick way!

452
00:30:34,147 --> 00:30:35,587
You're going to be
in so much trouble.

453
00:30:36,106 --> 00:30:37,065
Kiri, stop.

454
00:30:37,225 --> 00:30:38,262
Guys, come on.

455
00:30:38,381 --> 00:30:39,380
It's almost eclipse, come on.

456
00:30:42,218 --> 00:30:43,218
Put it down!
Down!

457
00:30:44,055 --> 00:30:45,015
Put it down or
I'll shoot you!

458
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:46,055
With me.

459
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:46,774
Drop it!

460
00:30:46,854 --> 00:30:47,493
Right now!

461
00:30:48,971 --> 00:30:49,889
Do not move!
Put your hands up!

462
00:30:49,969 --> 00:30:51,049
Put it down. Put it down.

463
00:30:51,208 --> 00:30:52,167
Spider.

464
00:30:52,727 --> 00:30:54,283
Get 'em!
Get 'em!

465
00:30:54,444 --> 00:30:55,763
Get over here! Come on!

466
00:30:56,323 --> 00:30:57,401
Get down!

467
00:30:58,121 --> 00:30:59,079
Stop fighting.

468
00:30:59,639 --> 00:31:00,638
Don't move!

469
00:31:00,837 --> 00:31:01,797
Check 'em for weapons!

470
00:31:02,356 --> 00:31:03,315
Kiri!

471
00:31:03,475 --> 00:31:04,793
Be calm...

472
00:31:06,311 --> 00:31:06,992
Shut up.

473
00:31:07,071 --> 00:31:07,711
Don't move.

474
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:09,628
What have we here?

475
00:31:19,257 --> 00:31:20,135
Hey, Colonel...

476
00:31:20,215 --> 00:31:20,974
check it out.

477
00:31:21,493 --> 00:31:22,453
Four fingers.

478
00:31:23,013 --> 00:31:24,092
We got a half-breed.

479
00:31:24,371 --> 00:31:25,331
Shit...

480
00:31:31,722 --> 00:31:32,922
Show me
your fingers.

481
00:31:38,155 --> 00:31:40,671
You're his,
aren't you?

482
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:43,949
You're his,
all right.

483
00:31:50,424 --> 00:31:51,462
Where is he?

484
00:31:53,261 --> 00:31:55,177
Sorry, I don't speak your language...

485
00:31:55,778 --> 00:31:57,734
...to buttholes.

486
00:31:58,172 --> 00:31:59,891
Where is your father?

487
00:32:02,168 --> 00:32:03,126
No!

488
00:32:05,166 --> 00:32:05,806
Really?

489
00:32:05,884 --> 00:32:07,324
You wanna play
it this way?

490
00:32:08,922 --> 00:32:09,763
Shut up!

491
00:32:13,436 --> 00:32:14,198
Kiri!

492
00:32:14,277 --> 00:32:15,076
No!
Stop!

493
00:32:15,556 --> 00:32:16,912
Hey! Hey, don't touch her!

494
00:32:17,791 --> 00:32:18,430
Hey!

495
00:32:19,229 --> 00:32:20,230
Don't hurt her, please.

496
00:32:22,425 --> 00:32:23,623
Don't move.

497
00:32:24,422 --> 00:32:25,502
What's your name, kid?

498
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,499
Spider...

499
00:32:29,219 --> 00:32:30,099
Socorro.

500
00:32:38,886 --> 00:32:39,845
Miles?

501
00:32:43,322 --> 00:32:44,840
Nobody calls me that.

502
00:32:47,518 --> 00:32:48,877
Well,
I'll be damned...

503
00:32:50,355 --> 00:32:52,794
Well, I figured they
sent you back to Earth.

504
00:32:53,991 --> 00:32:55,991
They can't put
babies in cryo, dipshit.

505
00:33:03,062 --> 00:33:04,619
What are we doin', boss?

506
00:33:06,977 --> 00:33:08,655
Iron Sky, Blue One, Actual.

507
00:33:13,252 --> 00:33:14,607
Blue One, Iron Sky,
send your traffic.

508
00:33:15,407 --> 00:33:17,126
We are standing by
for extract, over.

509
00:33:17,965 --> 00:33:18,924
Take us in.

510
00:33:19,083 --> 00:33:19,880
Dragonfly comin' left...

511
00:33:20,042 --> 00:33:21,360
we are go for extract.

512
00:33:21,879 --> 00:33:22,839
Be advised...

513
00:33:22,998 --> 00:33:24,237
we are bringin' in
high value prisoners.

514
00:33:24,397 --> 00:33:25,354
Let us go!

515
00:33:25,435 --> 00:33:26,075
Shut up.

516
00:33:26,153 --> 00:33:27,193
Sit tight, Blue One...

517
00:33:27,315 --> 00:33:28,112
we're inbound to your pos.

518
00:33:28,792 --> 00:33:30,030
That's bingo in ten.

519
00:33:30,151 --> 00:33:31,149
We're on the clock.

520
00:33:33,787 --> 00:33:35,106
-Sit!
-Come on, in the dirt!

521
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:36,303
-Feet up!
-Get down on the ground!

522
00:33:36,384 --> 00:33:37,023
Lyle...

523
00:33:37,102 --> 00:33:38,262
get me some audio on this.

524
00:33:39,341 --> 00:33:40,379
Shut your mouth.

525
00:33:40,457 --> 00:33:41,097
Don't look up!

526
00:33:42,217 --> 00:33:42,976
That's Sully's woman.

527
00:33:44,535 --> 00:33:45,612
She's an animal.

528
00:33:46,731 --> 00:33:47,690
Give it up, Quaritch.

529
00:33:48,929 --> 00:33:49,889
Sully.

530
00:33:50,009 --> 00:33:51,328
-It's all over.
-Son of a bitch.

531
00:33:52,647 --> 00:33:54,246
Nothin's over
while I'm breathin'.

532
00:33:55,804 --> 00:33:57,001
I kinda hoped you'd say that.

533
00:34:13,662 --> 00:34:14,822
No, no, you stay
with the ikran.

534
00:34:14,981 --> 00:34:15,981
But, Dad...

535
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:16,700
I'm a warrior like you.

536
00:34:16,779 --> 00:34:17,417
I'm supposed to fight.

537
00:34:17,658 --> 00:34:18,338
Neteyam.

538
00:34:18,537 --> 00:34:20,175
I'm not gonna say it again.

539
00:34:21,854 --> 00:34:22,812
Yes, sir.

540
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:45,988
Yeah, there's nothin' after that.

541
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:01,090
You want us to recover these remains?

542
00:35:26,339 --> 00:35:28,060
Blue One, stand by ready.

543
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,058
We are three minutes out.

544
00:35:29,218 --> 00:35:30,936
Heads up, three minutes.

545
00:35:45,918 --> 00:35:46,877
Watch our six.

546
00:36:34,105 --> 00:36:34,903
Shut up!

547
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:50,046
Shut up!

548
00:36:51,886 --> 00:36:53,005
Contact rear!

549
00:36:53,323 --> 00:36:54,122
Contact rear!

550
00:36:57,479 --> 00:36:58,438
Lo'ak!

551
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:00,156
Shit.

552
00:37:03,394 --> 00:37:04,032
You little shit.

553
00:37:04,113 --> 00:37:04,751
Lo'ak!

554
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:06,110
-Tuk, come on. Go, go, go!
-Get back here!

555
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:07,308
Run!

556
00:37:07,789 --> 00:37:08,667
Grab 'em!

557
00:37:15,339 --> 00:37:16,298
Come on!

558
00:37:17,298 --> 00:37:18,217
Cover!

559
00:37:21,892 --> 00:37:22,852
Come on!

560
00:37:37,433 --> 00:37:38,952
That you,
Mrs. Sully?

561
00:37:39,592 --> 00:37:41,510
I recognize your calling card.

562
00:37:51,938 --> 00:37:53,615
Why don't you come
on out, Mrs. Sully?

563
00:37:55,253 --> 00:37:56,413
You and I,
we got some...

564
00:37:56,852 --> 00:37:58,490
unfinished business.

565
00:38:02,806 --> 00:38:03,766
Demon!

566
00:38:04,285 --> 00:38:06,762
I will kill you as many
times as I have to!

567
00:38:07,841 --> 00:38:10,439
I guess you and the Corporal
have been pretty...

568
00:38:10,678 --> 00:38:12,077
busy, haven't you?

569
00:38:12,274 --> 00:38:14,073
Dropped yourself a whole litter of...

570
00:38:14,872 --> 00:38:15,871
half-breeds.

571
00:38:24,463 --> 00:38:25,141
Na'vi!

572
00:38:28,297 --> 00:38:29,257
Go, go, go!

573
00:38:31,536 --> 00:38:32,413
You okay?
You okay, boy?

574
00:38:32,495 --> 00:38:33,132
Yeah.

575
00:38:33,652 --> 00:38:35,089
Okay. With me.
Ready? Ready?

576
00:38:35,247 --> 00:38:35,888
Yes, sir!

577
00:38:38,087 --> 00:38:39,044
Move!

578
00:38:43,561 --> 00:38:44,519
Come on!

579
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:53,790
Go, go, go!

580
00:38:54,668 --> 00:38:55,827
Flank out. Get after 'em!

581
00:39:02,739 --> 00:39:03,698
Spider?

582
00:39:06,893 --> 00:39:07,935
Spider!

583
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:08,774
Kiri!

584
00:39:08,854 --> 00:39:09,573
Spider.

585
00:39:10,091 --> 00:39:11,649
Come! Come on.

586
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:13,928
Spider. He's down there.

587
00:39:14,009 --> 00:39:14,648
No.

588
00:39:19,641 --> 00:39:20,757
Ma'am,
we're at bingo.

589
00:39:20,918 --> 00:39:22,316
Ten minutes in enemy airspace.

590
00:39:23,436 --> 00:39:24,794
Blue One. Get back
to the rally point now.

591
00:39:32,105 --> 00:39:32,745
Blue One...

592
00:39:32,826 --> 00:39:33,467
fall back.

593
00:39:33,784 --> 00:39:34,744
Fall back!

594
00:39:34,944 --> 00:39:36,140
Fall back, fall back!

595
00:39:36,381 --> 00:39:37,339
Move out! Move!

596
00:39:38,218 --> 00:39:39,139
Move, move, move!

597
00:39:40,057 --> 00:39:40,896
-Kiri!
-Spider!

598
00:39:41,015 --> 00:39:42,134
Come, come.

599
00:39:42,215 --> 00:39:42,854
No.

600
00:39:42,932 --> 00:39:43,575
Come!

601
00:39:43,654 --> 00:39:44,653
Go, go, go.
Come on. Let's go.

602
00:39:47,369 --> 00:39:48,767
Hey. Hey, it's
okay. You hurt?

603
00:39:48,888 --> 00:39:49,807
-Are you hurt?
-No, I'm okay.

604
00:39:49,967 --> 00:39:51,126
-Tuk, you hurt?
-Daddy!

605
00:40:10,506 --> 00:40:11,545
Okay, we're clear.

606
00:40:11,664 --> 00:40:12,661
We're clear.
Everyone okay?

607
00:40:12,741 --> 00:40:14,018
-Mom!
-Tuk.

608
00:40:17,097 --> 00:40:19,292
It's okay.
It's okay. We're okay.

609
00:40:19,532 --> 00:40:21,370
Oh, thank you, Great
Mother. Thank you.

610
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:23,168
Thank you.

611
00:40:23,687 --> 00:40:24,646
Where's Spider?

612
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:26,925
They took him.

613
00:40:27,964 --> 00:40:28,923
They took him.

614
00:40:30,082 --> 00:40:31,362
Okay. It's all
right, baby girl.

615
00:40:31,521 --> 00:40:32,521
All right? He's
a tough kid.

616
00:40:33,319 --> 00:40:34,357
All right.

617
00:40:36,316 --> 00:40:37,275
He's gonna be okay.

618
00:40:38,951 --> 00:40:40,270
We're all gonna be okay.

619
00:40:49,819 --> 00:40:50,700
Goddamn!

620
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:51,457
Come on!

621
00:40:55,893 --> 00:40:57,252
Let me out
of here!

622
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,439
He's completely feral.

623
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,319
Thinks he's
one of them.

624
00:41:12,434 --> 00:41:13,632
This thing.
This Quaritch.

625
00:41:13,793 --> 00:41:14,793
Whatever
he is...

626
00:41:14,952 --> 00:41:15,950
-What's going on?
-He can walk right in here.

627
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:17,589
He can walk right
under Eywa's nose.

628
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:19,666
-This is our family. This is our home.
-This is about our family.

629
00:41:19,827 --> 00:41:21,104
This is about
our little ones.

630
00:41:22,384 --> 00:41:24,381
I cannot. You cannot ask this.

631
00:41:26,498 --> 00:41:28,138
I cannot leave
my People.

632
00:41:29,335 --> 00:41:30,054
I will not.

633
00:41:30,494 --> 00:41:31,533
He's hunting us.

634
00:41:33,371 --> 00:41:34,451
He's targeting
our family.

635
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:35,809
You cannot
ask this!

636
00:41:36,288 --> 00:41:39,005
The children. Everything they've
ever known. The forest.

637
00:41:39,405 --> 00:41:40,483
This is
our home!

638
00:41:40,644 --> 00:41:41,762
He had
our children.

639
00:41:41,921 --> 00:41:43,479
He had 'em
under his knife!

640
00:41:50,553 --> 00:41:52,150
My father gave me...

641
00:41:52,271 --> 00:41:54,388
this bow
as he lay dying.

642
00:41:54,467 --> 00:41:56,466
And he said
protect the People.

643
00:41:57,743 --> 00:41:59,302
You're
Toruk Makto!

644
00:42:00,462 --> 00:42:02,059
This will protect the People!

645
00:42:02,457 --> 00:42:03,655
Quaritch
has Spider.

646
00:42:03,774 --> 00:42:04,976
And that kid
knows everything.

647
00:42:05,095 --> 00:42:06,335
He knows our
whole operation...

648
00:42:06,454 --> 00:42:07,731
and he can lead
them right in here.

649
00:42:08,451 --> 00:42:10,768
If the People harbor
us, they will die.

650
00:42:12,368 --> 00:42:13,446
Do you
understand?

651
00:42:17,961 --> 00:42:19,040
Look, I
got nothing.

652
00:42:19,878 --> 00:42:21,037
I got
no plan...

653
00:42:23,194 --> 00:42:24,793
But I can protect this family.

654
00:42:24,952 --> 00:42:26,551
That I can do.

655
00:42:39,417 --> 00:42:40,935
I know
one thing.

656
00:42:43,694 --> 00:42:44,930
Wherever we go...

657
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:46,729
this family is our fortress.

658
00:43:00,034 --> 00:43:01,433
Where is Jake Sully?

659
00:43:01,552 --> 00:43:02,632
I don't know!

660
00:43:04,391 --> 00:43:05,547
We know that
you know.

661
00:43:06,386 --> 00:43:07,625
I don't know!

662
00:43:07,825 --> 00:43:08,623
Just form a picture...

663
00:43:08,704 --> 00:43:09,383
in your mind.

664
00:43:09,783 --> 00:43:11,220
Is it one of the
floating mountains?

665
00:43:12,099 --> 00:43:13,219
Let me out of here!

666
00:43:13,378 --> 00:43:14,778
He's fighting us.
Give us a minute.

667
00:43:14,978 --> 00:43:15,617
I don't know!

668
00:43:16,056 --> 00:43:18,135
Just form a thought,
and we will see it.

669
00:43:19,213 --> 00:43:20,492
I don't know!

670
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:23,249
Look, I don't like this
any more than you do.

671
00:43:24,129 --> 00:43:25,647
Which clans would be harboring him?

672
00:43:25,725 --> 00:43:26,365
I don't know!

673
00:43:26,444 --> 00:43:27,604
You're gonna
have to kill me!

674
00:43:29,561 --> 00:43:30,241
Watch this.

675
00:43:30,321 --> 00:43:31,877
You're peaking all
over the prefrontal.

676
00:43:31,999 --> 00:43:33,036
It's not gonna stop...

677
00:43:33,155 --> 00:43:34,156
until you give
us something.

678
00:43:34,316 --> 00:43:35,554
Where is he?

679
00:43:36,154 --> 00:43:38,033
I don't know,
you buttholes! Okay?

680
00:43:38,192 --> 00:43:39,393
I don't know!

681
00:43:52,175 --> 00:43:54,454
General, let me try
the personal angle.

682
00:43:58,888 --> 00:44:00,088
He's not your son.

683
00:44:30,372 --> 00:44:31,413
Easy, tiger.

684
00:44:31,573 --> 00:44:32,411
Easy.

685
00:44:40,962 --> 00:44:41,921
We good?

686
00:44:48,234 --> 00:44:49,273
Kid, you
got heart.

687
00:44:50,350 --> 00:44:52,628
Those science pukes
leaned on you pretty hard.

688
00:44:53,787 --> 00:44:55,264
But you gave
them nothin'.

689
00:44:57,303 --> 00:44:58,341
I respect that.

690
00:45:04,096 --> 00:45:05,534
I thought you
might want this.

691
00:45:13,646 --> 00:45:15,123
That's Colonel
Miles Quaritch.

692
00:45:15,881 --> 00:45:16,841
Deceased.

693
00:45:17,479 --> 00:45:18,599
Killed
in action.

694
00:45:24,115 --> 00:45:25,353
I'm not
that man.

695
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:30,267
But I do have
his memories...

696
00:45:33,262 --> 00:45:34,661
enough to
know that...

697
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:37,416
well, he wasn't
always the best father.

698
00:45:39,216 --> 00:45:40,853
But that's
not an apology.

699
00:45:42,052 --> 00:45:44,251
I'm not your father.
Technically...

700
00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:46,847
you and I, we're
nothin' to each other.

701
00:45:47,287 --> 00:45:48,247
But...

702
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:50,405
I can
help you.

703
00:45:51,363 --> 00:45:52,880
I can get you
outta here.

704
00:45:56,717 --> 00:45:58,874
I'm not gonna ask you
to betray Jake Sully.

705
00:45:58,993 --> 00:46:00,953
I know you'd never
do that. You're loyal...

706
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:03,748
and I
admire loyalty.

707
00:46:06,147 --> 00:46:07,385
Just ride along.

708
00:46:10,103 --> 00:46:12,620
Otherwise, I gotta give
you back to the lab coats.

709
00:46:21,488 --> 00:46:23,167
This is like stones
in my heart.

710
00:46:25,005 --> 00:46:27,563
Tarsem is wise
for his years.

711
00:46:27,722 --> 00:46:29,400
He will be
a strong Olo'eyktan.

712
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:33,116
The leader must die.

713
00:46:37,192 --> 00:46:38,989
So the leader
can be born.

714
00:46:41,826 --> 00:46:43,984
Toruk Makto
will disappear.

715
00:46:46,262 --> 00:46:47,861
The People
will be safe.

716
00:47:13,353 --> 00:47:15,151
A father protects.

717
00:47:16,347 --> 00:47:17,984
It's what gives
him meaning.

718
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:23,459
One life ends.

719
00:47:24,538 --> 00:47:25,937
Another begins.

720
00:47:39,402 --> 00:47:40,361
Tuk.

721
00:47:44,316 --> 00:47:46,075
The sea clans are a
world unto themselves.

722
00:47:47,193 --> 00:47:48,672
Thousands of islands.

723
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:53,186
An unknown territory into which
we could just vanish without a trace.

724
00:47:53,985 --> 00:47:55,624
Are we there yet?

725
00:48:19,835 --> 00:48:22,874
AWA'ATLU, A METKAYINA VILLAGE

726
00:48:58,674 --> 00:48:59,552
Hey...

727
00:48:59,713 --> 00:49:00,350
leave it.

728
00:49:02,069 --> 00:49:03,027
On me.

729
00:49:05,066 --> 00:49:06,025
Tuk.

730
00:49:07,542 --> 00:49:08,501
Be nice.

731
00:49:10,381 --> 00:49:11,100
Be nice.

732
00:49:11,858 --> 00:49:12,819
Hey.

733
00:49:30,678 --> 00:49:31,877
Easy.
Just be cool.

734
00:49:32,635 --> 00:49:33,715
Look.
What is that?

735
00:49:34,516 --> 00:49:35,673
Is that supposed
to be a tail?

736
00:49:52,573 --> 00:49:53,572
It's too small.

737
00:49:53,731 --> 00:49:54,690
How are they
supposed to swim?

738
00:49:54,850 --> 00:49:57,049
Do not.
Rotxo, Aonung.

739
00:49:59,685 --> 00:50:00,646
Hey.

740
00:50:24,538 --> 00:50:26,976
Tonowari was the chief
of the Metkayina...

741
00:50:27,495 --> 00:50:28,454
the Reef People.

742
00:50:29,332 --> 00:50:30,570
I See you,
Tonowari.

743
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:32,769
Jakesully.

744
00:50:32,889 --> 00:50:34,129
I knew him as
a tough leader.

745
00:50:38,843 --> 00:50:40,599
But it wasn't Tonowari
I was worried about.

746
00:50:44,754 --> 00:50:46,272
I See you, Ronal.

747
00:50:46,472 --> 00:50:47,672
Tsahik of
the Metkayina.

748
00:50:47,832 --> 00:50:48,911
I See you,
Ronal.

749
00:50:51,107 --> 00:50:53,025
Why do you come
to us, Jakesully?

750
00:50:54,265 --> 00:50:55,263
We seek uturu.

751
00:50:57,501 --> 00:50:58,940
Yes, sanctuary
for my family.

752
00:51:01,935 --> 00:51:03,614
We are
Reef People.

753
00:51:03,774 --> 00:51:04,453
You are
Forest People.

754
00:51:04,893 --> 00:51:06,370
Your skills will
mean nothing here.

755
00:51:07,049 --> 00:51:09,248
Well, we will learn
your ways. Am I right?

756
00:51:09,447 --> 00:51:10,407
Yes.

757
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:14,882
Their arms
are thin.

758
00:51:15,841 --> 00:51:16,640
Mom.

759
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:17,519
Their tails...

760
00:51:17,838 --> 00:51:19,118
are weak.

761
00:51:19,238 --> 00:51:20,837
You will be
slow in the water.

762
00:51:23,912 --> 00:51:25,111
These children...

763
00:51:25,272 --> 00:51:27,026
-are not even true Na'vi.
-Dad.

764
00:51:28,905 --> 00:51:30,064
Yes, we are!

765
00:51:33,539 --> 00:51:34,818
They have
demon blood!

766
00:51:39,654 --> 00:51:40,892
Look. Look.

767
00:51:42,810 --> 00:51:44,809
Look, I was born of the Sky
People, and now I am Na'vi.

768
00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:46,128
All right?
You can adapt.

769
00:51:46,806 --> 00:51:47,924
We will adapt.

770
00:51:48,124 --> 00:51:48,843
Okay?

771
00:51:50,041 --> 00:51:52,039
My husband
was Toruk Makto.

772
00:51:53,838 --> 00:51:54,795
He led the clans to...

773
00:51:54,875 --> 00:51:57,793
victory against the Sky People.

774
00:52:01,430 --> 00:52:02,549
This you
call victory?

775
00:52:03,667 --> 00:52:05,225
Hiding among
strangers?

776
00:52:09,379 --> 00:52:12,018
It seems Eywa has
turned her back on you...

777
00:52:12,137 --> 00:52:12,937
Chosen One.

778
00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:20,569
I apologize for
my mate. She's...

779
00:52:20,689 --> 00:52:22,049
Do not
apologize for me.

780
00:52:22,168 --> 00:52:23,406
...flown a long way,
and she's exhausted.

781
00:52:23,486 --> 00:52:24,284
Jake.

782
00:52:29,199 --> 00:52:31,714
Toruk Makto is a
great war leader.

783
00:52:32,476 --> 00:52:34,990
All Na'vi people know his story.

784
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:36,549
But we Metkayina...

785
00:52:36,708 --> 00:52:37,989
-Dad.
-...are not at war.

786
00:52:40,744 --> 00:52:43,463
We cannot let you
bring your war here.

787
00:52:43,622 --> 00:52:45,419
I'm done
with war.

788
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:46,498
Okay?

789
00:52:47,058 --> 00:52:48,898
I just want to keep
my family safe.

790
00:52:53,172 --> 00:52:55,090
Uturu has
been asked.

791
00:52:59,845 --> 00:53:00,883
Do we have to go?

792
00:53:01,722 --> 00:53:02,682
We'll be okay.

793
00:53:14,828 --> 00:53:17,223
Toruk Makto and his
family will stay with us.

794
00:53:18,382 --> 00:53:20,660
Treat them as our
brothers and sisters.

795
00:53:21,978 --> 00:53:23,776
Now, they do not
know the sea.

796
00:53:24,658 --> 00:53:26,336
So they will be
like babies...

797
00:53:27,014 --> 00:53:27,853
taking their...

798
00:53:27,974 --> 00:53:28,932
first breath.

799
00:53:29,652 --> 00:53:33,645
Teach them our ways, so they
do not suffer the shame of being...

800
00:53:33,726 --> 00:53:35,045
useless.

801
00:53:37,122 --> 00:53:37,841
Okay, what
do we say?

802
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:39,999
Thank you.

803
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:41,278
Thank you.

804
00:53:41,796 --> 00:53:45,314
My son, Aonung, our daughter, Tsireya,
will show your children what to do.

805
00:53:45,674 --> 00:53:47,233
-Father, why do...
-It is decided.

806
00:53:48,031 --> 00:53:50,668
Come. I will show
you our village.

807
00:54:00,696 --> 00:54:01,655
This way.

808
00:54:04,891 --> 00:54:06,371
Tuk, let's go.

809
00:54:06,852 --> 00:54:07,850
Just up here.

810
00:54:16,158 --> 00:54:17,357
This is for you.

811
00:54:18,037 --> 00:54:18,996
Your new home.

812
00:54:20,353 --> 00:54:21,311
Yeah, this will work.

813
00:54:22,271 --> 00:54:23,311
This is great.

814
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:24,389
It's nice, right?

815
00:54:37,415 --> 00:54:38,493
Okay, Sullys, fall in.

816
00:54:38,613 --> 00:54:39,413
Remember?

817
00:54:39,532 --> 00:54:40,331
Family
meeting.

818
00:54:40,491 --> 00:54:41,449
Come on. Take
a knee. Let's go.

819
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:42,449
Kiri.

820
00:54:42,770 --> 00:54:43,729
What?

821
00:54:43,929 --> 00:54:45,446
Okay.

822
00:54:45,605 --> 00:54:47,245
I need
you kids

823
00:54:47,325 --> 00:54:48,923
on your best
behavior.

824
00:54:49,122 --> 00:54:50,520
I mean it.

825
00:54:50,681 --> 00:54:52,119
Learn fast.
Pull your weight.

826
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,276
Don't cause trouble.
You got it?

827
00:54:55,476 --> 00:54:56,633
Yes, sir.

828
00:54:58,952 --> 00:55:00,670
I want to
go home.

829
00:55:02,585 --> 00:55:04,144
Oh, Tuk.

830
00:55:04,665 --> 00:55:07,942
Tuk, this is
our home now.

831
00:55:09,301 --> 00:55:12,535
Now we're gonna
get through this.

832
00:55:12,696 --> 00:55:13,574
We're gonna
get through this

833
00:55:13,735 --> 00:55:15,494
if we have each
other's backs. All right?

834
00:55:15,653 --> 00:55:17,569
What does your
father always say?

835
00:55:18,168 --> 00:55:20,526
Sullys stick
together.

836
00:55:20,647 --> 00:55:22,763
That's right.
Sullys stick together.

837
00:55:22,884 --> 00:55:24,523
Now this time
with some feeling.

838
00:55:24,643 --> 00:55:25,881
Yeah.

839
00:55:26,081 --> 00:55:28,279
Sullys stick
together.

840
00:55:28,718 --> 00:55:30,118
Sullys stick
together.

841
00:55:40,224 --> 00:55:41,183
Come on.

842
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,358
Swim together with us.

843
00:57:49,401 --> 00:57:50,959
What's wrong with them?

844
00:57:51,958 --> 00:57:53,556
Those guys are bad divers.

845
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:54,754
Stop.

846
00:57:55,275 --> 00:57:56,673
They're learning.

847
00:58:06,901 --> 00:58:08,260
Are you all right?

848
00:58:08,379 --> 00:58:09,017
You're too fast!

849
00:58:09,177 --> 00:58:10,576
Wait for us.

850
00:58:11,495 --> 00:58:12,496
Just breathe.

851
00:58:12,615 --> 00:58:13,533
Breathe.

852
00:58:13,694 --> 00:58:14,772
You are not
good divers.

853
00:58:15,451 --> 00:58:17,611
Maybe good at swinging
through trees, but...

854
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:19,209
Come on, bro.

855
00:58:19,328 --> 00:58:21,245
We don't speak this
finger talk, guys.

856
00:58:21,365 --> 00:58:22,326
We don't know
what you're saying.

857
00:58:22,764 --> 00:58:23,725
I will teach you.

858
00:58:23,924 --> 00:58:25,161
-Where is Kiri?
-Kiri?

859
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:26,279
-Who?
-Kiri.

860
00:58:26,439 --> 00:58:27,399
Where is Kiri?

861
00:58:27,558 --> 00:58:28,756
Did you see her?

862
00:58:38,945 --> 00:58:40,344
Get on the ship...

863
00:58:40,464 --> 00:58:41,982
find a seat, and
keep out of the way.

864
00:58:43,501 --> 00:58:44,341
Let's go!

865
00:58:45,179 --> 00:58:46,097
Chop-chop.

866
00:58:46,217 --> 00:58:47,055
Sweet.

867
00:58:47,496 --> 00:58:49,533
Whoa, hold on
there, hotshot!

868
00:58:50,692 --> 00:58:51,650
You listen up.

869
00:58:52,848 --> 00:58:54,967
There's a tracker
built in that mask.

870
00:58:55,127 --> 00:58:57,045
We hit the ground,
and you take off...

871
00:58:57,244 --> 00:58:59,323
I'll have you back
in two minutes...

872
00:58:59,443 --> 00:59:01,959
and I will give you a
old-school ass-whippin'.

873
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:03,078
Understood?

874
00:59:04,159 --> 00:59:05,238
Understood?

875
00:59:05,637 --> 00:59:06,833
Yes, sir.

876
00:59:07,194 --> 00:59:08,152
We up?

877
00:59:08,273 --> 00:59:09,231
Team's up.

878
00:59:23,215 --> 00:59:24,294
All right, listen up.

879
00:59:25,533 --> 00:59:27,649
Jake Sully's gone to ground.

880
00:59:28,209 --> 00:59:29,168
Don't matter.

881
00:59:29,289 --> 00:59:30,568
Wherever he is,
we'll find him...

882
00:59:30,807 --> 00:59:33,363
and his batshit crazy wife, too.

883
00:59:35,003 --> 00:59:36,161
To do so...

884
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:38,440
we go Na'vi.

885
00:59:38,599 --> 00:59:39,759
Full tilt, all the way.

886
00:59:39,838 --> 00:59:40,557
That means we...

887
00:59:40,637 --> 00:59:44,152
eat Na'vi.
We ride Na'vi.

888
00:59:44,272 --> 00:59:46,070
Think Na'vi.

889
00:59:46,230 --> 00:59:51,345
And that starts with
speaking the language.

890
00:59:53,861 --> 00:59:55,860
You call that speaking the language?

891
00:59:56,140 --> 00:59:58,616
You sound like a three year old!

892
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:02,174
All right, smart guy.

893
01:00:03,053 --> 01:00:05,370
You just went from bein'
our monkey mascot...

894
01:00:05,489 --> 01:00:07,048
to official interpreter.

895
01:00:14,039 --> 01:00:15,396
These are ilu.

896
01:00:15,915 --> 01:00:17,356
If you want to live here...

897
01:00:17,514 --> 01:00:18,793
you have to ride.

898
01:00:19,753 --> 01:00:21,031
Make the bond gently.

899
01:00:26,267 --> 01:00:27,904
Feel his breath.

900
01:00:28,065 --> 01:00:29,461
Feel his strength.

901
01:00:31,538 --> 01:00:32,497
Hold here.

902
01:00:35,055 --> 01:00:36,133
Hold on.

903
01:00:54,873 --> 01:00:55,593
You all right...

904
01:00:55,753 --> 01:00:56,751
Forest Boy?

905
01:01:06,301 --> 01:01:07,859
This is a warrior's mount.

906
01:01:08,019 --> 01:01:09,217
Not easy to master.

907
01:01:09,419 --> 01:01:11,855
Perhaps you should...

908
01:01:11,973 --> 01:01:12,972
start with an ilu.

909
01:01:13,491 --> 01:01:14,531
Nah.
This one.

910
01:01:17,687 --> 01:01:18,925
Now remember...

911
01:01:19,405 --> 01:01:21,564
when you dive back
in, good position.

912
01:01:21,763 --> 01:01:22,723
Very important.

913
01:01:26,198 --> 01:01:27,158
I got this.

914
01:01:52,810 --> 01:01:53,967
That's it, okay.

915
01:01:55,085 --> 01:01:56,044
Steady.

916
01:02:09,950 --> 01:02:11,148
Ah, shit.

917
01:02:40,635 --> 01:02:42,233
I love her already.

918
01:03:20,751 --> 01:03:21,790
Breathe in.

919
01:03:24,906 --> 01:03:26,345
And breathe out.

920
01:03:27,422 --> 01:03:29,541
Imagine flickering a flame.

921
01:03:31,539 --> 01:03:34,377
You must slow down
your heartbeat.

922
01:03:35,855 --> 01:03:36,815
Breathe in.

923
01:03:38,053 --> 01:03:40,130
Breathe from down here.

924
01:03:41,568 --> 01:03:43,406
Breathe out slowly.

925
01:03:45,521 --> 01:03:47,999
Lo'ak, your heartbeat is fast.

926
01:03:48,118 --> 01:03:49,718
-Sorry.
-Try to focus.

927
01:03:49,879 --> 01:03:51,196
-Okay.
-Breathe in.

928
01:03:53,195 --> 01:03:54,871
And breathe out.

929
01:03:54,991 --> 01:03:56,510
Let your mind go clear.

930
01:04:14,532 --> 01:04:16,568
You are learning to breathe.

931
01:04:21,882 --> 01:04:23,681
Come on!
Keep up, losers!

932
01:04:37,665 --> 01:04:38,625
I got this.

933
01:04:45,176 --> 01:04:46,175
What?

934
01:04:46,332 --> 01:04:49,012
Na'vi kids younger than me
do this with their bare hands.

935
01:04:51,169 --> 01:04:53,087
Jake Sully did it the hard way?

936
01:04:53,766 --> 01:04:54,927
What do you think?

937
01:04:58,281 --> 01:04:59,323
What are we doin', Colonel?

938
01:05:04,153 --> 01:05:05,154
This is gonna be good.

939
01:05:08,470 --> 01:05:09,628
All right, move up.

940
01:05:16,743 --> 01:05:18,180
It's you and me, cupcake.

941
01:05:31,125 --> 01:05:33,242
Did I mention you're
supposed to tie the mouth shut first?

942
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:35,559
Thanks a lot, kid!

943
01:05:40,193 --> 01:05:40,835
Move up,
move up!

944
01:05:48,984 --> 01:05:49,943
You see 'em?

945
01:06:11,359 --> 01:06:12,958
All right, let's go.
We're Oscar Mike.

946
01:06:13,078 --> 01:06:13,758
Come on.

947
01:06:16,795 --> 01:06:18,074
Let's go.
We're outta here.

948
01:06:23,946 --> 01:06:24,904
Yeah!

949
01:06:25,385 --> 01:06:26,421
That's right!

950
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:30,418
Yeah, Colonel!
Get some!

951
01:06:30,579 --> 01:06:31,496
Yeah, Colonel!

952
01:06:31,695 --> 01:06:32,854
Who's up next?

953
01:06:41,207 --> 01:06:44,644
The way of water has
no beginning and no end.

954
01:06:49,117 --> 01:06:51,075
The sea is around you...

955
01:06:51,634 --> 01:06:52,313
and in you.

956
01:06:58,668 --> 01:07:00,986
The sea is your home...

957
01:07:01,666 --> 01:07:03,383
before your birth...

958
01:07:04,301 --> 01:07:05,981
and after your death.

959
01:07:11,493 --> 01:07:14,928
Our hearts beat in
the womb of the world.

960
01:07:17,286 --> 01:07:21,442
Our breath burns
in the shadows of the deep.

961
01:07:22,761 --> 01:07:24,518
The sea gives...

962
01:07:25,798 --> 01:07:27,556
and the sea takes.

963
01:07:30,432 --> 01:07:33,189
Water connects all things.

964
01:07:35,305 --> 01:07:37,024
Life to death.

965
01:07:39,101 --> 01:07:40,060
Darkness...

966
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:42,418
to light.

967
01:07:44,496 --> 01:07:45,135
I got it!

968
01:07:46,295 --> 01:07:46,933
You did it!

969
01:08:03,355 --> 01:08:06,431
It gives breath under water.

970
01:08:47,666 --> 01:08:48,665
What is she doing?

971
01:08:49,386 --> 01:08:50,345
I don't know.

972
01:08:50,504 --> 01:08:52,019
She's just looking at the sand.

973
01:08:54,657 --> 01:08:55,736
What'd you say?

974
01:08:56,057 --> 01:08:58,651
Are you some kind of... freak?

975
01:08:59,451 --> 01:09:00,770
He asked if you are a freak.

976
01:09:04,006 --> 01:09:04,646
No.

977
01:09:05,446 --> 01:09:06,525
Are you sure?

978
01:09:06,645 --> 01:09:08,162
I mean, you're
not even real Na'vi.

979
01:09:08,762 --> 01:09:10,080
Look at these hands.

980
01:09:10,361 --> 01:09:11,441
I mean, look at them...

981
01:09:12,279 --> 01:09:13,235
Hey!

982
01:09:13,675 --> 01:09:14,994
Back off, fishlips!

983
01:09:15,153 --> 01:09:17,313
Oh, another
four-fingered freak.

984
01:09:17,471 --> 01:09:18,629
Look at his little baby tail!

985
01:09:18,749 --> 01:09:19,707
Don't touch me!

986
01:09:19,828 --> 01:09:20,468
Baby tail!

987
01:09:20,588 --> 01:09:21,708
Leave us alone!

988
01:09:22,067 --> 01:09:22,906
He's not normal.

989
01:09:23,306 --> 01:09:24,025
Look at his tail.

990
01:09:24,185 --> 01:09:24,864
Aw, baby tail!

991
01:09:25,145 --> 01:09:26,303
It is so cute!

992
01:09:27,621 --> 01:09:28,660
You heard
what she said.

993
01:09:29,619 --> 01:09:30,737
Leave them alone.

994
01:09:31,299 --> 01:09:32,377
Ah, big brother come...

995
01:09:33,535 --> 01:09:34,813
Back off.

996
01:09:35,891 --> 01:09:37,011
Now.

997
01:09:42,604 --> 01:09:43,883
Smart choice.

998
01:09:44,322 --> 01:09:45,681
And from now on...

999
01:09:45,801 --> 01:09:47,720
I need you to
respect my sister.

1000
01:09:51,913 --> 01:09:52,553
Let's go.

1001
01:09:55,628 --> 01:09:57,027
Buh-bye!

1002
01:09:57,346 --> 01:09:58,306
Look at them.

1003
01:09:58,465 --> 01:09:59,425
They're all freaks.

1004
01:09:59,585 --> 01:10:00,543
The whole family.

1005
01:10:02,742 --> 01:10:03,701
Lo'ak.

1006
01:10:03,860 --> 01:10:04,820
I got this, bro.

1007
01:10:08,376 --> 01:10:09,694
I know this hand is funny.

1008
01:10:09,814 --> 01:10:12,370
Look, I'm a freak.
An alien.

1009
01:10:13,610 --> 01:10:15,408
But it can do
something really cool.

1010
01:10:15,566 --> 01:10:16,525
Watch.

1011
01:10:16,605 --> 01:10:18,884
First, I ball it up
real tight like this.

1012
01:10:19,084 --> 01:10:20,162
Okay? Then...

1013
01:10:24,198 --> 01:10:25,157
It's called a
punch, bitch!

1014
01:10:25,315 --> 01:10:26,596
Don't ever touch my sister again.

1015
01:10:28,115 --> 01:10:29,673
Yeah! Aonung!
Show him!

1016
01:10:31,589 --> 01:10:32,550
Come here!

1017
01:10:33,707 --> 01:10:34,668
Hey!
Hey!

1018
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:40,259
Stop this!

1019
01:10:41,140 --> 01:10:42,096
Stop it!

1020
01:10:44,255 --> 01:10:45,295
So stupid!

1021
01:10:48,530 --> 01:10:49,490
Ow, my tail!

1022
01:10:51,369 --> 01:10:53,366
My ear!
Let go!

1023
01:10:53,684 --> 01:10:55,763
He's got my ear!

1024
01:11:00,478 --> 01:11:02,195
What was the
one thing I asked?

1025
01:11:02,275 --> 01:11:02,913
The one thing!

1026
01:11:02,992 --> 01:11:04,231
-Stay out of trouble.
-Stay out of trouble.

1027
01:11:04,391 --> 01:11:05,352
-Right.
-It was my fault.

1028
01:11:05,472 --> 01:11:06,151
I don't think so.

1029
01:11:06,271 --> 01:11:07,709
You gotta stop takin' the
heat for this knucklehead.

1030
01:11:07,908 --> 01:11:09,547
Look, Dad. Aonung
was picking on Kiri.

1031
01:11:10,265 --> 01:11:11,227
He called her a freak.

1032
01:11:15,141 --> 01:11:16,300
Go apologize to Aonung.

1033
01:11:16,820 --> 01:11:17,700
What?

1034
01:11:17,859 --> 01:11:19,694
He is the chief's son.
Do you understand?

1035
01:11:20,613 --> 01:11:22,292
I don't care how you do it.
Just go make peace.

1036
01:11:22,653 --> 01:11:23,610
Just go.

1037
01:11:28,566 --> 01:11:29,525
Hey.

1038
01:11:31,443 --> 01:11:32,722
So what'd the
other guys look like?

1039
01:11:33,481 --> 01:11:34,479
Worse.

1040
01:11:35,159 --> 01:11:36,117
That's good.

1041
01:11:36,677 --> 01:11:37,637
A lot worse.

1042
01:11:37,916 --> 01:11:39,075
Get outta here.

1043
01:11:50,222 --> 01:11:51,259
What is wrong?

1044
01:11:53,179 --> 01:11:54,857
Nothing. I'm fine.

1045
01:11:56,015 --> 01:11:57,735
Why should I not be fine?

1046
01:12:04,806 --> 01:12:07,002
Why can't I just be
like everyone else?

1047
01:12:09,121 --> 01:12:10,279
Oh, Kiri.

1048
01:12:13,597 --> 01:12:15,953
Ah, what's tree
boy doing here?

1049
01:12:19,110 --> 01:12:20,149
I'm sorry
I hit you.

1050
01:12:20,987 --> 01:12:22,105
So many times.

1051
01:12:28,298 --> 01:12:29,737
We should
be friends.

1052
01:12:32,294 --> 01:12:33,255
Come hunting with us.

1053
01:12:33,852 --> 01:12:34,972
Outside
the reef.

1054
01:12:35,730 --> 01:12:37,247
It's where
the men hunt.

1055
01:12:38,287 --> 01:12:39,328
No way.
I'm not allowed.

1056
01:12:40,405 --> 01:12:42,201
I must be asking
the wrong brother.

1057
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:44,040
Let's do it.

1058
01:12:58,546 --> 01:13:00,104
Come on! Come on!

1059
01:13:01,023 --> 01:13:01,982
Yeah!

1060
01:13:09,492 --> 01:13:10,970
Keep up, Forest Boy!

1061
01:13:12,370 --> 01:13:13,209
Yeah!

1062
01:13:14,608 --> 01:13:18,683
THREE BROTHERS ROCKS

1063
01:13:25,554 --> 01:13:27,073
Hey, you lived!

1064
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:29,069
That was
insane, cuz!

1065
01:13:30,189 --> 01:13:31,147
This way.

1066
01:13:31,227 --> 01:13:32,146
I know a
good spot.

1067
01:13:44,533 --> 01:13:46,091
Call the fish.

1068
01:14:01,436 --> 01:14:02,794
What a moron!

1069
01:14:22,292 --> 01:14:23,290
Hey, guys!

1070
01:14:24,011 --> 01:14:24,969
Hey!

1071
01:14:27,445 --> 01:14:28,404
Aonung!

1072
01:14:29,883 --> 01:14:31,241
Come on, this isn't funny!

1073
01:14:42,908 --> 01:14:43,867
Hey,
Aonung!

1074
01:18:09,757 --> 01:18:10,598
Holy shit.

1075
01:18:38,803 --> 01:18:39,762
You're a tulkun.

1076
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:44,318
You saved my life.

1077
01:18:44,958 --> 01:18:45,917
Thank you.

1078
01:18:47,277 --> 01:18:48,234
Thank you.

1079
01:18:54,827 --> 01:18:56,746
Buddy, I have no idea
what you just said.

1080
01:19:03,417 --> 01:19:04,935
They hurt you, didn't they?

1081
01:19:07,173 --> 01:19:08,413
I'll try to
pull it out.

1082
01:19:09,891 --> 01:19:10,970
Just trust me, okay?

1083
01:19:44,571 --> 01:19:45,529
Friends?

1084
01:19:48,966 --> 01:19:51,125
That's right, we're
friends. Friends.

1085
01:19:55,799 --> 01:19:56,479
Bro!

1086
01:21:04,641 --> 01:21:06,960
I'm sorry.

1087
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:45,396
So, what is it,
baby girl?

1088
01:21:46,714 --> 01:21:47,793
You missin'
Spider?

1089
01:21:50,989 --> 01:21:51,950
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

1090
01:21:53,028 --> 01:21:54,308
But that's
not it.

1091
01:21:56,705 --> 01:21:57,624
Okay...

1092
01:21:59,422 --> 01:22:00,382
So what is it?

1093
01:22:01,538 --> 01:22:02,816
I feel her, Dad.

1094
01:22:05,375 --> 01:22:06,333
You feel who?

1095
01:22:07,052 --> 01:22:08,009
Eywa.

1096
01:22:12,564 --> 01:22:13,924
I hear her breathing.

1097
01:22:15,323 --> 01:22:16,721
I hear her heartbeat.

1098
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:19,479
She's so close.

1099
01:22:20,637 --> 01:22:22,755
She's just there...

1100
01:22:24,634 --> 01:22:26,352
like a word about
to be spoken.

1101
01:22:32,024 --> 01:22:33,822
I know you think I'm crazy.

1102
01:22:36,539 --> 01:22:38,418
You're not crazy,
baby girl.

1103
01:22:42,614 --> 01:22:44,811
So what does Eywa's
heartbeat sound like?

1104
01:22:49,724 --> 01:22:50,964
Mighty.

1105
01:22:58,395 --> 01:22:59,752
Tell him what
you told me!

1106
01:23:05,347 --> 01:23:06,786
You like lookin' at the stars?

1107
01:23:10,021 --> 01:23:11,700
You know, my dad
came from a star.

1108
01:23:13,219 --> 01:23:14,097
That one.

1109
01:23:14,178 --> 01:23:14,816
Right there.

1110
01:23:18,214 --> 01:23:19,132
Lo'ak!

1111
01:23:19,572 --> 01:23:20,851
Oh, man. I'm in trouble.

1112
01:23:23,688 --> 01:23:24,366
Go.

1113
01:23:24,487 --> 01:23:25,444
I will see you again.

1114
01:23:43,307 --> 01:23:45,265
-The boy has returned!
-It is the Sully boy.

1115
01:23:45,425 --> 01:23:46,821
-They found the boy.
-They found him.

1116
01:23:52,333 --> 01:23:53,291
Hey, hey.

1117
01:23:55,491 --> 01:23:56,569
Let's have a look at you. Okay.

1118
01:23:58,087 --> 01:23:59,326
He's fine.
He's fine...

1119
01:23:59,406 --> 01:24:00,047
yeah.

1120
01:24:00,126 --> 01:24:01,324
Just a few scratches.

1121
01:24:04,243 --> 01:24:05,681
I pray for the strength that I will not...

1122
01:24:05,802 --> 01:24:07,638
pluck the eyeballs out of my youngest son!

1123
01:24:09,238 --> 01:24:10,197
No.

1124
01:24:10,636 --> 01:24:13,070
My son knows better
than to take him outside the reef.

1125
01:24:15,508 --> 01:24:17,146
The blame is his.

1126
01:24:18,385 --> 01:24:19,666
Okay, let's go.

1127
01:24:20,223 --> 01:24:21,184
No.

1128
01:24:21,582 --> 01:24:22,741
This is not Aonung's fault.

1129
01:24:23,460 --> 01:24:24,658
This was my idea.

1130
01:24:24,819 --> 01:24:26,258
Aonung tried to talk me out of it.

1131
01:24:27,178 --> 01:24:28,135
Really.

1132
01:24:28,776 --> 01:24:29,413
Come on.

1133
01:24:30,894 --> 01:24:31,891
I'm sorry.

1134
01:24:32,650 --> 01:24:33,289
Come on.

1135
01:24:36,486 --> 01:24:37,445
I got this.

1136
01:24:40,521 --> 01:24:41,999
Is this true?

1137
01:24:42,158 --> 01:24:44,116
Aonung. What were you thinking?

1138
01:24:47,234 --> 01:24:49,111
Dad, you told me to make
friends with these kids.

1139
01:24:49,231 --> 01:24:50,991
-That's all I was trying to...
-I don't want to hear it.

1140
01:24:51,150 --> 01:24:52,109
Dad...

1141
01:24:52,270 --> 01:24:53,705
You brought shame to this family.

1142
01:24:56,823 --> 01:24:57,902
Can I go now?

1143
01:24:58,501 --> 01:24:59,979
Any more trouble,
I jerk a knot in your tail.

1144
01:25:00,180 --> 01:25:01,257
You read me?

1145
01:25:01,698 --> 01:25:03,575
Yes, sir.
Lima Charlie.

1146
01:25:13,844 --> 01:25:15,002
Where were you?

1147
01:25:15,163 --> 01:25:16,081
Yeah.

1148
01:25:16,201 --> 01:25:17,960
What happened to "keep
an eye on your brother"?

1149
01:25:18,639 --> 01:25:19,597
Sorry, sir.

1150
01:25:23,993 --> 01:25:25,552
Why did you speak for me?

1151
01:25:26,270 --> 01:25:27,468
Because I know what it's like...

1152
01:25:27,549 --> 01:25:28,828
to be one big disappointment.

1153
01:25:32,341 --> 01:25:34,182
I wish I'd been there.

1154
01:25:34,302 --> 01:25:36,137
The ocean blessed
you with a gift, brother.

1155
01:25:36,776 --> 01:25:38,976
The tulkun have not returned yet.

1156
01:25:39,174 --> 01:25:41,052
And anyway, no tulkun is ever alone.

1157
01:25:41,812 --> 01:25:42,810
Well, this one was.

1158
01:25:43,730 --> 01:25:45,529
He had a missing fin.

1159
01:25:45,649 --> 01:25:46,528
Like a stump.

1160
01:25:46,648 --> 01:25:47,286
On the left side.

1161
01:25:47,366 --> 01:25:48,446
Poor tulkun.

1162
01:25:49,126 --> 01:25:50,086
Payakan.

1163
01:25:51,960 --> 01:25:52,759
Who's Payakan?

1164
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:55,198
A young bull who went rogue.

1165
01:25:55,318 --> 01:25:56,835
He's outcast.
Alone.

1166
01:25:57,354 --> 01:25:58,434
And he has a missing fin.

1167
01:25:58,672 --> 01:26:00,071
They say he is a killer.

1168
01:26:00,191 --> 01:26:02,029
-No, no.
-He killed Na'vi...

1169
01:26:02,109 --> 01:26:03,908
and other tulkun.

1170
01:26:05,387 --> 01:26:06,186
Not here...

1171
01:26:06,345 --> 01:26:07,065
but far to the south.

1172
01:26:07,225 --> 01:26:07,864
No, he's no killer.

1173
01:26:09,783 --> 01:26:11,301
You are lucky to be alive.

1174
01:26:11,462 --> 01:26:12,659
I'm telling you guys.

1175
01:26:12,779 --> 01:26:13,817
He saved my life.

1176
01:26:14,497 --> 01:26:15,537
He's my friend.

1177
01:26:16,216 --> 01:26:17,332
My baby bro!

1178
01:26:17,452 --> 01:26:18,451
The Mighty Warrior...

1179
01:26:19,051 --> 01:26:20,170
who faced the killer tulkun...

1180
01:26:20,250 --> 01:26:21,088
and lived to tell about it, huh?

1181
01:26:23,364 --> 01:26:24,403
You guys aren't listening.

1182
01:26:25,402 --> 01:26:28,241
-Lo'ak, I'm listening.
-Lo'ak, come back.

1183
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:29,639
You skxawngs.

1184
01:26:30,719 --> 01:26:31,357
Payakan!

1185
01:26:33,635 --> 01:26:34,354
Payakan!

1186
01:26:37,032 --> 01:26:37,751
Payakan!

1187
01:26:46,299 --> 01:26:47,179
It's good to see you.

1188
01:26:50,457 --> 01:26:52,016
Why are you outcast?

1189
01:26:52,175 --> 01:26:53,133
What happened?

1190
01:26:54,411 --> 01:26:57,049
It's too painful.

1191
01:26:58,569 --> 01:27:00,724
I trust you.

1192
01:27:01,443 --> 01:27:03,442
You can trust me.

1193
01:27:47,392 --> 01:27:48,472
Bro, that's disgusting!

1194
01:27:52,627 --> 01:27:54,228
Go faster!

1195
01:28:28,385 --> 01:28:29,544
We are here.

1196
01:28:35,939 --> 01:28:37,977
This is the Cove of the Ancestors.

1197
01:28:38,137 --> 01:28:39,535
Our most sacred place.

1198
01:28:46,325 --> 01:28:49,202
Eclipse is the best
time of day to be here.

1199
01:29:01,990 --> 01:29:02,949
This is it.

1200
01:29:03,428 --> 01:29:04,745
This is the Spirit Tree.

1201
01:30:08,832 --> 01:30:10,233
My beautiful daughter.

1202
01:30:11,632 --> 01:30:12,589
Hi, Ma.

1203
01:30:13,509 --> 01:30:14,788
I'm so happy to see you.

1204
01:30:15,868 --> 01:30:16,826
But you look troubled.

1205
01:30:22,979 --> 01:30:23,938
My sweet girl.

1206
01:30:24,777 --> 01:30:26,095
It will be okay.

1207
01:30:33,326 --> 01:30:34,405
What is it, baby?

1208
01:30:35,844 --> 01:30:37,123
Why am I different?

1209
01:30:39,640 --> 01:30:41,800
What does the Great
Mother want from me?

1210
01:30:45,194 --> 01:30:47,112
Who was my father?

1211
01:30:51,066 --> 01:30:52,545
Oh, my darling.

1212
01:30:57,179 --> 01:30:58,299
No!

1213
01:31:15,797 --> 01:31:16,837
Come on.

1214
01:31:22,551 --> 01:31:23,912
What is wrong?
What is it?

1215
01:31:24,591 --> 01:31:25,708
It was a seizure.

1216
01:31:26,227 --> 01:31:27,187
Is she breathing?

1217
01:31:27,745 --> 01:31:28,825
Is she breathing?

1218
01:31:32,141 --> 01:31:33,299
Get her to the village!

1219
01:31:33,380 --> 01:31:34,060
Hurry!

1220
01:31:34,140 --> 01:31:35,338
Let's go!
Let's move!

1221
01:31:35,459 --> 01:31:36,096
Tuk, come.

1222
01:31:50,682 --> 01:31:51,878
-Hi!
-It's good to see you.

1223
01:31:52,038 --> 01:31:53,077
Let's get the gear.
Neteyam!

1224
01:31:53,196 --> 01:31:54,195
Neteyam, keep
them back!

1225
01:31:54,396 --> 01:31:55,116
How is she?

1226
01:31:55,275 --> 01:31:56,394
She's still unconscious.

1227
01:31:57,311 --> 01:31:58,431
There's no bleed.

1228
01:31:58,551 --> 01:31:59,630
There's no fracture.

1229
01:32:00,630 --> 01:32:02,108
No effects of hypoxia.

1230
01:32:02,267 --> 01:32:03,346
The brain looks good.

1231
01:32:07,861 --> 01:32:10,658
But we still have this interictal
activity right here in the prefrontal.

1232
01:32:10,859 --> 01:32:12,497
-Okay.
-She's definitely had a seizure.

1233
01:32:12,735 --> 01:32:14,892
-I think we can rule out toxins.
-So what is it?

1234
01:32:16,053 --> 01:32:17,531
I see that I am
not needed here.

1235
01:32:18,129 --> 01:32:19,527
You are Tsahik!

1236
01:32:21,406 --> 01:32:22,685
Remove
these things.

1237
01:32:23,445 --> 01:32:24,404
Out!

1238
01:32:24,523 --> 01:32:25,204
You have
done nothing!

1239
01:32:25,362 --> 01:32:26,801
Come on, come on.
Let's just take a break.

1240
01:32:27,522 --> 01:32:28,957
Okay, hold on.
I gotta take her IV off.

1241
01:32:30,514 --> 01:32:31,475
Tuktirey.

1242
01:32:39,704 --> 01:32:42,782
She said that she can feel Eywa.
She can hear her heartbeat.

1243
01:32:42,903 --> 01:32:43,981
-That's it.
-What?

1244
01:32:44,101 --> 01:32:46,258
That is classic
frontal lobe epilepsy.

1245
01:32:46,860 --> 01:32:47,817
-Epilepsy?
-Yep.

1246
01:32:47,977 --> 01:32:49,934
You see visions.
You get...

1247
01:32:50,094 --> 01:32:52,333
states of religious ecstasy
like the kind she's describing.

1248
01:33:00,162 --> 01:33:03,479
Pluggin' into the Spirit Tree
is some sort of a trigger.

1249
01:33:03,679 --> 01:33:05,357
You definitely can't let
her do that anymore.

1250
01:33:07,556 --> 01:33:08,555
What? Ever?

1251
01:33:08,714 --> 01:33:09,673
Jake.

1252
01:33:10,153 --> 01:33:11,910
If she seizes
underwater again...

1253
01:33:12,630 --> 01:33:13,790
it could kill her.

1254
01:33:25,693 --> 01:33:26,652
You're awake!

1255
01:33:35,246 --> 01:33:36,681
Kiri, my sweet child.

1256
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:38,999
Oh, my sweet little girl.

1257
01:33:39,679 --> 01:33:40,638
Okay, this one.

1258
01:33:40,757 --> 01:33:41,595
"I See you."

1259
01:33:47,790 --> 01:33:48,987
That's what I
just said, isn't it?

1260
01:33:50,987 --> 01:33:53,383
Not "Naati. Ngaati."

1261
01:33:54,504 --> 01:33:56,661
All right. Like comin'
out your nose or something.

1262
01:33:57,538 --> 01:33:58,497
Boss...

1263
01:33:59,137 --> 01:34:00,934
long-range patrol
picked up a radar hit.

1264
01:34:01,095 --> 01:34:02,333
A rogue gunship.

1265
01:34:03,292 --> 01:34:04,251
Where?

1266
01:34:04,370 --> 01:34:05,970
Eastern sea.
Four hundred klicks north.

1267
01:34:08,807 --> 01:34:09,766
Hang on.

1268
01:34:12,204 --> 01:34:16,158
The signal was intermittent,
and they lost it over open water but...

1269
01:34:16,837 --> 01:34:18,153
if you project the track...

1270
01:34:19,512 --> 01:34:21,152
it hits this island group.

1271
01:34:22,271 --> 01:34:24,068
That's hundreds
of islands.

1272
01:34:24,227 --> 01:34:26,225
That's a big search box
with lots of villages.

1273
01:34:26,386 --> 01:34:27,386
This is our guy.

1274
01:34:28,225 --> 01:34:31,182
You give me ships and aircraft,
I'll bring you back his scalp.

1275
01:34:42,727 --> 01:34:43,807
Bogies inbound.

1276
01:34:43,927 --> 01:34:44,645
Skipper.

1277
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:54,077
-All stop.
-All stop.

1278
01:34:54,196 --> 01:34:55,435
All stop. Aye.

1279
01:35:13,575 --> 01:35:14,574
Hey.

1280
01:35:15,053 --> 01:35:16,211
You Scoresby?

1281
01:35:17,529 --> 01:35:20,288
Are you the asshole
who's commandeering my ship?

1282
01:35:20,885 --> 01:35:22,003
That would
be me.

1283
01:35:23,562 --> 01:35:26,438
The target's pretty much
this whole island group.

1284
01:35:27,118 --> 01:35:28,277
Never been up there.

1285
01:35:29,476 --> 01:35:31,795
You know those waters, doc.
What kinda indigenous we got?

1286
01:35:32,472 --> 01:35:35,750
Metkayina, mostly. Some
Ta'unui. Maybe fifty villages.

1287
01:35:35,910 --> 01:35:37,268
And you
are who?

1288
01:35:38,306 --> 01:35:39,586
I'm Ian Garvin.

1289
01:35:40,865 --> 01:35:42,141
Marine biologist.

1290
01:35:42,302 --> 01:35:43,500
Fifty villages.

1291
01:35:43,660 --> 01:35:45,779
A hundred villages.
I don't care. We'll search 'em all.

1292
01:35:46,857 --> 01:35:48,055
I hunt tulkun.

1293
01:35:48,773 --> 01:35:50,932
That's what I'm rigged for.
That's all my guys do.

1294
01:35:51,092 --> 01:35:52,691
I've got quotas to meet.

1295
01:35:53,769 --> 01:35:55,608
I'll be nice once.

1296
01:35:56,288 --> 01:35:57,246
Then I won't.

1297
01:36:00,401 --> 01:36:01,761
Well, if you can't
get out of it...

1298
01:36:02,917 --> 01:36:03,877
get into it!

1299
01:36:04,755 --> 01:36:07,035
-All crews to stations!
-Hey, don't touch.

1300
01:36:09,351 --> 01:36:09,989
Helm, bring her up.

1301
01:36:10,070 --> 01:36:10,909
Flight speed.

1302
01:36:11,069 --> 01:36:12,267
Flight speed, aye.

1303
01:36:22,618 --> 01:36:23,854
What was that?

1304
01:36:25,053 --> 01:36:25,812
What's going on?

1305
01:36:29,128 --> 01:36:30,847
The tulkun have returned!

1306
01:36:31,008 --> 01:36:33,924
Everybody, our Brothers
and Sisters have returned.

1307
01:36:43,713 --> 01:36:45,790
In their endless cycle of migration...

1308
01:36:46,110 --> 01:36:47,949
the tulkun had come home.

1309
01:36:54,980 --> 01:36:56,339
Kiri, come on. Come on!

1310
01:36:56,539 --> 01:36:57,779
Tuk, leave me alone.

1311
01:36:57,859 --> 01:36:59,017
-Come on!
-What?

1312
01:37:00,615 --> 01:37:01,772
What do you want?

1313
01:37:02,093 --> 01:37:02,934
Look.

1314
01:37:11,480 --> 01:37:12,320
Come on.

1315
01:37:13,320 --> 01:37:14,399
Let's go meet them.

1316
01:37:15,077 --> 01:37:15,798
Look...

1317
01:37:15,877 --> 01:37:17,116
it's my Spirit Sister.

1318
01:38:11,656 --> 01:38:14,452
Sister, I See you.

1319
01:38:15,131 --> 01:38:17,688
I See you, Sister. I am happy.

1320
01:38:23,323 --> 01:38:26,440
Your son is beautiful.

1321
01:38:27,039 --> 01:38:29,595
Thank you. How is your baby?

1322
01:38:30,553 --> 01:38:32,791
My baby is strong.

1323
01:38:35,548 --> 01:38:36,707
I met a boy.

1324
01:38:36,827 --> 01:38:38,425
It was a time for stories.

1325
01:38:39,583 --> 01:38:40,702
Of their season apart.

1326
01:38:41,463 --> 01:38:42,181
Of deaths...

1327
01:38:42,263 --> 01:38:42,900
and births.

1328
01:38:45,297 --> 01:38:46,295
Of old friends...

1329
01:38:46,376 --> 01:38:47,256
and new loves.

1330
01:39:02,919 --> 01:39:05,475
TA'UNUI VILLAGE

1331
01:39:06,554 --> 01:39:07,473
Children.

1332
01:39:10,191 --> 01:39:10,988
Be calm...

1333
01:39:11,147 --> 01:39:12,146
my people.

1334
01:39:12,547 --> 01:39:13,866
We're looking for weapons...

1335
01:39:13,985 --> 01:39:15,863
comms. Any kind of tech.

1336
01:39:16,263 --> 01:39:17,021
Get down.

1337
01:39:17,101 --> 01:39:17,900
You too.

1338
01:39:17,980 --> 01:39:18,821
You see this?

1339
01:39:19,739 --> 01:39:20,818
Stay down and shut up!

1340
01:39:23,935 --> 01:39:25,014
This man...

1341
01:39:25,614 --> 01:39:28,810
We know he is in these islands.

1342
01:39:29,568 --> 01:39:30,568
Here? This village?

1343
01:39:31,845 --> 01:39:33,402
We are a totally separate clan...

1344
01:39:33,602 --> 01:39:35,320
...this man in the reflection...

1345
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:36,838
...is from the forest.

1346
01:39:36,998 --> 01:39:37,997
Now what's he saying?

1347
01:39:38,158 --> 01:39:39,156
They never saw him.

1348
01:39:39,277 --> 01:39:40,114
These are Sea People.

1349
01:39:40,235 --> 01:39:41,714
Forest People don't come here.

1350
01:39:41,834 --> 01:39:43,352
I ain't buyin' that.

1351
01:39:48,428 --> 01:39:50,425
He needs to leave here...

1352
01:39:50,544 --> 01:39:52,383
and go to the forest to find this man.

1353
01:39:54,700 --> 01:39:56,259
They don't know anything.

1354
01:39:58,894 --> 01:39:59,852
Shoot that animal.

1355
01:40:03,770 --> 01:40:04,689
What the hell are you doing?

1356
01:40:13,438 --> 01:40:14,437
Be calm.

1357
01:40:15,955 --> 01:40:17,155
Your ears workin' now?

1358
01:40:17,235 --> 01:40:18,074
Be calm!

1359
01:40:18,155 --> 01:40:19,792
You see what these can do, huh?

1360
01:40:21,989 --> 01:40:23,146
Jake Sully.

1361
01:40:24,106 --> 01:40:26,545
Toruk Makto!

1362
01:40:26,703 --> 01:40:28,023
He told you he doesn't know!

1363
01:40:28,183 --> 01:40:29,062
Put her down!

1364
01:40:29,220 --> 01:40:29,980
Get down!

1365
01:40:31,779 --> 01:40:32,658
Get down!

1366
01:40:32,938 --> 01:40:34,574
Stop!

1367
01:40:34,654 --> 01:40:36,413
You make it real clear to him.

1368
01:40:36,891 --> 01:40:38,051
He doesn't give up Sully...

1369
01:40:38,691 --> 01:40:39,968
we kill the Tsahik.

1370
01:40:40,168 --> 01:40:41,407
No, I'm not doin' that.

1371
01:40:41,526 --> 01:40:42,487
Is that right?

1372
01:40:43,127 --> 01:40:44,684
I'm not gonna be a part of this!

1373
01:40:45,324 --> 01:40:45,963
Get down!

1374
01:40:46,123 --> 01:40:47,482
These people don't know anything!

1375
01:40:47,641 --> 01:40:48,800
They don't know anything!

1376
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:50,078
Don't move!

1377
01:40:54,394 --> 01:40:55,312
We really gonna waste her?

1378
01:40:56,550 --> 01:40:57,389
Please.

1379
01:40:57,509 --> 01:40:58,788
Please don't do this.

1380
01:40:58,908 --> 01:40:59,708
This is wrong.

1381
01:40:59,867 --> 01:41:01,866
What you're doing here is wrong.

1382
01:41:03,144 --> 01:41:03,903
Please.

1383
01:41:08,899 --> 01:41:10,098
Burn the hooches.

1384
01:41:11,054 --> 01:41:12,451
Hey, light 'em up.

1385
01:41:12,611 --> 01:41:14,011
Light 'em up. All of 'em!

1386
01:41:14,491 --> 01:41:15,570
Flamethrowers up!

1387
01:41:26,477 --> 01:41:27,755
I'm sorry!

1388
01:41:28,035 --> 01:41:29,755
I didn't know!

1389
01:41:30,194 --> 01:41:31,712
Stop this madness!

1390
01:41:32,311 --> 01:41:33,629
I'm sorry.

1391
01:41:33,789 --> 01:41:34,909
We're outta here.

1392
01:41:36,588 --> 01:41:37,664
Don't touch me!

1393
01:41:38,262 --> 01:41:38,982
I'm sorry.

1394
01:41:39,062 --> 01:41:40,062
Let's go.

1395
01:41:40,462 --> 01:41:41,100
Saddle up.

1396
01:41:41,181 --> 01:41:41,900
All right. Let's go.

1397
01:42:05,752 --> 01:42:06,711
What's wrong?

1398
01:42:06,872 --> 01:42:08,070
Sky People.

1399
01:42:09,588 --> 01:42:11,428
They're looking for you, Jakesully.

1400
01:42:11,868 --> 01:42:12,667
South.

1401
01:42:12,986 --> 01:42:13,624
They have a human...

1402
01:42:13,744 --> 01:42:15,582
boy who speaks Na'vi.

1403
01:42:19,419 --> 01:42:20,937
Did they kill anybody?

1404
01:42:21,576 --> 01:42:22,934
Not yet.

1405
01:42:24,132 --> 01:42:25,171
They threaten.

1406
01:42:25,570 --> 01:42:27,929
But the villagers will not
tell them where you are.

1407
01:42:28,288 --> 01:42:29,326
By my order.

1408
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:39,278
We must hunt this demon.

1409
01:42:39,397 --> 01:42:40,395
Trap him.

1410
01:42:40,514 --> 01:42:41,393
Kill him.

1411
01:42:43,113 --> 01:42:44,111
We've gotta be smart.

1412
01:42:44,910 --> 01:42:45,828
We gotta be smart.

1413
01:42:46,028 --> 01:42:46,787
If we hit Quaritch...

1414
01:42:46,946 --> 01:42:48,786
they're gonna
know where we are...

1415
01:42:48,946 --> 01:42:51,064
and they're gonna come
here with everything they've got.

1416
01:42:52,422 --> 01:42:53,662
Then what is our plan?

1417
01:42:55,379 --> 01:42:56,536
That's Toruk Makto!

1418
01:42:56,736 --> 01:42:57,495
Head down.

1419
01:42:58,375 --> 01:42:59,455
Has he been here?

1420
01:43:04,128 --> 01:43:05,246
This shit ain't workin'.

1421
01:43:06,084 --> 01:43:07,284
Nah, they're stonewallin' us.

1422
01:43:08,043 --> 01:43:09,363
If we turn up the heat...

1423
01:43:09,522 --> 01:43:10,962
he's just gonna keep runnin'.

1424
01:43:11,201 --> 01:43:12,638
We gotta draw him out.

1425
01:43:21,628 --> 01:43:22,666
I'm over it.

1426
01:43:23,905 --> 01:43:25,984
I've got quotas to meet.

1427
01:43:26,144 --> 01:43:27,581
You wanna hunt?

1428
01:43:28,021 --> 01:43:29,181
Let's hunt.

1429
01:43:30,578 --> 01:43:31,338
Here? Not here.

1430
01:43:31,458 --> 01:43:32,738
There's too many villages.

1431
01:43:32,896 --> 01:43:34,255
No.
No, no, no.

1432
01:43:35,495 --> 01:43:36,653
Respectfully, sir...

1433
01:43:37,332 --> 01:43:38,211
you do not understand...

1434
01:43:38,370 --> 01:43:39,249
the kinship bonds...

1435
01:43:39,329 --> 01:43:41,009
between the tulkun
and the ocean Na'vi.

1436
01:43:41,209 --> 01:43:43,284
It would be like murdering
a member of their family.

1437
01:43:43,403 --> 01:43:44,603
If we start hunting here...

1438
01:43:44,721 --> 01:43:46,761
the hostiles will come after us.

1439
01:43:47,001 --> 01:43:48,077
Exactly.

1440
01:43:48,917 --> 01:43:49,556
One hostile...

1441
01:43:49,636 --> 01:43:50,755
in particular.

1442
01:44:00,586 --> 01:44:02,185
I know how you feel.

1443
01:44:04,819 --> 01:44:07,617
I feel all alone too.

1444
01:44:09,494 --> 01:44:10,732
Tell me.

1445
01:44:10,973 --> 01:44:12,452
Why are you outcast?

1446
01:46:29,857 --> 01:46:31,136
I'm sorry.

1447
01:46:31,295 --> 01:46:32,696
I'm so sorry.

1448
01:46:36,489 --> 01:46:37,448
It's okay.

1449
01:46:38,128 --> 01:46:38,929
It's okay.

1450
01:46:52,992 --> 01:46:54,430
You allowed this.

1451
01:46:55,869 --> 01:46:59,106
You allowed him to
bond with the outcast!

1452
01:47:01,743 --> 01:47:02,701
Tsireya.

1453
01:47:04,341 --> 01:47:05,938
You disappoint me, daughter.

1454
01:47:07,137 --> 01:47:08,375
And you...

1455
01:47:08,535 --> 01:47:09,816
son of a great warrior...

1456
01:47:09,935 --> 01:47:11,374
who has been taught better.

1457
01:47:11,532 --> 01:47:13,089
Payakan saved my life, sir.

1458
01:47:13,209 --> 01:47:14,088
You don't know him.

1459
01:47:14,249 --> 01:47:15,488
No, Lo'ak.

1460
01:47:16,527 --> 01:47:17,483
Sit.

1461
01:47:18,923 --> 01:47:20,081
Sit.

1462
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:24,119
Sit down!

1463
01:47:28,073 --> 01:47:29,510
Hear my words, boy.

1464
01:47:31,350 --> 01:47:33,665
In the days of the First Songs...

1465
01:47:33,985 --> 01:47:36,303
tulkun fought amongst themselves...

1466
01:47:36,423 --> 01:47:38,381
for territory...

1467
01:47:38,501 --> 01:47:39,819
and for revenge.

1468
01:47:40,778 --> 01:47:42,577
But they came to believe...

1469
01:47:42,738 --> 01:47:45,174
that killing,
no matter how justified...

1470
01:47:45,334 --> 01:47:47,973
only brings more killing.

1471
01:47:49,730 --> 01:47:52,887
So all killing was forbidden.

1472
01:47:53,006 --> 01:47:55,721
This is the Tulkun Way.

1473
01:47:56,881 --> 01:47:57,841
Payakan...

1474
01:47:58,679 --> 01:48:00,756
is a killer, so...

1475
01:48:00,836 --> 01:48:02,715
he is outcast.

1476
01:48:02,875 --> 01:48:03,834
I'm sorry, sir.

1477
01:48:03,994 --> 01:48:04,713
But you're wrong.

1478
01:48:04,913 --> 01:48:05,592
Lo'ak.

1479
01:48:06,632 --> 01:48:07,630
You speak to Olo'eyktan!

1480
01:48:07,831 --> 01:48:08,551
I know what I...

1481
01:48:08,629 --> 01:48:09,587
That's enough!

1482
01:48:13,783 --> 01:48:14,822
I know what I know.

1483
01:48:18,096 --> 01:48:19,335
That's enough.

1484
01:48:21,013 --> 01:48:22,732
I'll deal with this one.

1485
01:48:28,646 --> 01:48:30,045
This storm will pass.

1486
01:48:31,523 --> 01:48:35,357
Lo'ak, I saw something today.

1487
01:48:35,597 --> 01:48:37,076
I saw a Forest Boy...

1488
01:48:37,196 --> 01:48:38,516
chosen by tulkun.

1489
01:48:39,355 --> 01:48:41,791
I am very proud of you.

1490
01:48:41,950 --> 01:48:43,708
Payakan didn't kill those boys.

1491
01:48:44,428 --> 01:48:45,388
I saw it all.

1492
01:48:45,587 --> 01:48:48,144
The demon ship killed his
mother right in front of him.

1493
01:48:48,304 --> 01:48:50,263
He gathered the young bulls
and the reef boys together

1494
01:48:50,383 --> 01:48:51,540
to attack the ship.

1495
01:48:52,181 --> 01:48:54,019
And they were all killed...

1496
01:48:54,419 --> 01:48:56,254
but by the Sky People.
Not by him.

1497
01:48:56,414 --> 01:48:58,173
-He's not a killer.
-No, Lo'ak.

1498
01:48:58,331 --> 01:49:00,650
By the Tulkun Way, he is.

1499
01:49:00,811 --> 01:49:01,847
He bears those deaths.

1500
01:49:01,967 --> 01:49:04,206
Does he have to pay for
it for the rest of his life?

1501
01:49:04,405 --> 01:49:06,722
He knows what he did was wrong.
He would never do it again.

1502
01:49:08,361 --> 01:49:09,400
We must tell my father...

1503
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:10,358
No. No.

1504
01:49:10,478 --> 01:49:11,638
I'm in enough trouble
with my dad already.

1505
01:49:11,797 --> 01:49:12,956
Your father will understand this.

1506
01:49:13,116 --> 01:49:13,994
No, he won't.

1507
01:49:14,556 --> 01:49:16,352
He doesn't understand anything.

1508
01:49:16,553 --> 01:49:18,110
The whole clan hates me.

1509
01:49:18,229 --> 01:49:19,387
Demon blood.

1510
01:49:19,588 --> 01:49:21,306
Alien. That's all they see.

1511
01:49:27,340 --> 01:49:28,978
I See you.

1512
01:49:33,093 --> 01:49:35,572
You are Brother of Tulkun.

1513
01:49:37,730 --> 01:49:39,605
You are one of us now.

1514
01:49:56,068 --> 01:49:57,027
You got my mother?

1515
01:49:57,188 --> 01:49:59,862
Mother and calf.
Strong signal. Range 4,000.

1516
01:50:00,022 --> 01:50:00,781
Bring it down...

1517
01:50:00,901 --> 01:50:01,581
on the hull.

1518
01:50:01,742 --> 01:50:03,139
Comin' down, aye.

1519
01:50:03,260 --> 01:50:04,217
Foils deployed.

1520
01:50:25,634 --> 01:50:26,393
Sub teams...

1521
01:50:26,513 --> 01:50:27,152
two minutes!

1522
01:50:27,232 --> 01:50:28,711
Let's get in there!

1523
01:50:28,872 --> 01:50:30,790
Hatches closed!

1524
01:50:30,909 --> 01:50:31,788
Come on, hustle!

1525
01:50:31,867 --> 01:50:32,788
Hustle!

1526
01:50:32,907 --> 01:50:34,746
Crews to their boats.
Two minutes.

1527
01:50:34,867 --> 01:50:36,023
Let's make some bank.

1528
01:50:37,142 --> 01:50:38,461
Boat crews!

1529
01:50:38,622 --> 01:50:41,017
Let's get those tie downs off!
Tie downs off!

1530
01:50:46,130 --> 01:50:47,888
All boats in! Boats in!

1531
01:50:52,284 --> 01:50:53,764
Let's go, baby!

1532
01:51:04,152 --> 01:51:05,350
We're rollin'!

1533
01:51:30,564 --> 01:51:31,962
Stand by depth charges...

1534
01:51:32,121 --> 01:51:34,039
and fire, fire, fire!

1535
01:51:55,494 --> 01:51:56,375
What's that?

1536
01:51:56,455 --> 01:51:57,334
What are they doin'?

1537
01:51:58,533 --> 01:52:00,169
Those are echolocation sensors.

1538
01:52:00,330 --> 01:52:01,608
How they navigate.

1539
01:52:01,768 --> 01:52:02,688
They have to hold...

1540
01:52:02,768 --> 01:52:03,447
them out of the water...

1541
01:52:03,647 --> 01:52:04,683
or they'll go deaf.

1542
01:52:05,642 --> 01:52:06,601
Picadors!

1543
01:52:06,882 --> 01:52:07,521
Get in there!

1544
01:52:07,602 --> 01:52:08,240
Go on.

1545
01:52:08,320 --> 01:52:09,918
Get in there.
Get up in there!

1546
01:52:25,300 --> 01:52:27,458
They're gonna cut the cow
from the rest of the pod...

1547
01:52:27,657 --> 01:52:29,176
using the sound cannon.

1548
01:52:29,378 --> 01:52:31,173
They target the mother
because the calf swims slowly...

1549
01:52:31,453 --> 01:52:34,131
and she won't leave the calf.

1550
01:52:34,611 --> 01:52:36,089
Do they ever fight back?

1551
01:52:36,328 --> 01:52:38,607
Nah, never seen 'em lift a fin.

1552
01:52:39,166 --> 01:52:41,004
Tough bastards to kill though.

1553
01:52:42,283 --> 01:52:43,722
Sub teams, go!

1554
01:52:44,322 --> 01:52:45,081
And release.

1555
01:52:49,074 --> 01:52:50,712
Release, release.

1556
01:52:55,308 --> 01:52:56,267
There's our gal.

1557
01:52:56,466 --> 01:52:57,425
Target in sight.

1558
01:52:57,825 --> 01:52:59,303
3-6 is in hot with harpoons.

1559
01:52:59,465 --> 01:53:00,583
Here we go, baby.

1560
01:53:01,900 --> 01:53:03,778
See, we go in from below...

1561
01:53:03,899 --> 01:53:05,698
where there's gaps in the armor.

1562
01:53:09,411 --> 01:53:10,930
All right, let's go.
Get up in there.

1563
01:53:11,091 --> 01:53:12,049
I'm goin' in.

1564
01:53:12,209 --> 01:53:13,448
Get me in close.

1565
01:53:16,844 --> 01:53:17,802
Hold her steady.

1566
01:53:17,922 --> 01:53:19,482
In range. Arm one.

1567
01:53:19,640 --> 01:53:21,200
Arming, target lock.

1568
01:53:21,400 --> 01:53:22,478
And one away.

1569
01:53:28,510 --> 01:53:29,829
Two's in hot.

1570
01:53:30,029 --> 01:53:30,988
-Arm one.
-Arming.

1571
01:53:31,188 --> 01:53:32,186
Fire.

1572
01:53:36,182 --> 01:53:37,022
Good strike.
Arm two.

1573
01:53:37,102 --> 01:53:37,741
Arming.

1574
01:53:37,821 --> 01:53:38,819
Two away.

1575
01:53:40,016 --> 01:53:40,977
Booyah!

1576
01:53:41,177 --> 01:53:42,017
Nice.

1577
01:53:42,215 --> 01:53:43,774
3-6, you owe us a beer.

1578
01:53:48,409 --> 01:53:50,366
You see, the bags
slow her down...

1579
01:53:50,486 --> 01:53:51,645
and keep her up at the surface.

1580
01:53:51,764 --> 01:53:52,723
Yeah.

1581
01:53:52,924 --> 01:53:54,002
Get on her!

1582
01:53:54,201 --> 01:53:55,401
Get me in there.

1583
01:53:55,560 --> 01:53:56,880
Straight up on her.

1584
01:53:57,159 --> 01:53:58,078
30 meters.

1585
01:53:58,917 --> 01:54:00,435
Explosive-tipped harpoon.

1586
01:54:00,955 --> 01:54:03,553
Ten meters. Get me in there.
Put me in the pocket.

1587
01:54:03,953 --> 01:54:05,070
Now steady, steady.

1588
01:54:05,189 --> 01:54:06,188
Stay with her.

1589
01:54:06,548 --> 01:54:07,988
Hold. Hold.

1590
01:54:10,063 --> 01:54:11,302
Line's runnin'!

1591
01:54:17,776 --> 01:54:19,853
Hold on to your ponytail, Colonel!

1592
01:54:30,363 --> 01:54:31,399
Hold back full!

1593
01:54:31,558 --> 01:54:32,758
Back full, aye.

1594
01:54:39,231 --> 01:54:41,549
Hold her.

1595
01:54:44,707 --> 01:54:47,263
She takes an explosive
harpoon to the chest...

1596
01:54:47,384 --> 01:54:48,742
and she's still runnin'.

1597
01:54:49,621 --> 01:54:51,180
Beautiful.

1598
01:56:01,899 --> 01:56:04,616
The only way to reach
the gland is from below.

1599
01:56:04,776 --> 01:56:06,854
We drill up through
the hard palate...

1600
01:56:07,734 --> 01:56:09,651
into the brain. And...

1601
01:56:13,368 --> 01:56:15,482
These are highly intelligent beings.

1602
01:56:15,603 --> 01:56:16,521
Probably smarter than us.

1603
01:56:16,682 --> 01:56:17,921
Not smarter than me.

1604
01:56:18,121 --> 01:56:19,479
That is setting the bar very low.

1605
01:56:19,640 --> 01:56:21,116
Hey, I'm the one with the harpoon.

1606
01:56:22,635 --> 01:56:23,594
Yep.

1607
01:56:34,264 --> 01:56:35,223
How do you know?

1608
01:56:35,381 --> 01:56:36,499
That they're smarter than us?

1609
01:56:37,379 --> 01:56:38,979
More neurons, more pathways.

1610
01:56:39,777 --> 01:56:41,854
Not only are they smarter, they're...

1611
01:56:42,014 --> 01:56:43,172
deeply emotional.

1612
01:56:44,093 --> 01:56:45,252
More spiritual.

1613
01:56:49,448 --> 01:56:52,202
See, this region here corresponds
with our emotional centers...

1614
01:56:52,402 --> 01:56:54,680
but proportionally it's much larger.

1615
01:56:56,039 --> 01:56:57,518
They have music...

1616
01:56:57,637 --> 01:56:59,193
philosophy...

1617
01:56:59,353 --> 01:57:00,792
mathematics...

1618
01:57:01,353 --> 01:57:02,550
complex language.

1619
01:57:03,029 --> 01:57:03,749
Okay.

1620
01:57:04,469 --> 01:57:05,547
Here we go.

1621
01:57:06,347 --> 01:57:07,666
Show me the money.

1622
01:57:12,182 --> 01:57:14,099
So that's what this is all about?

1623
01:57:14,698 --> 01:57:15,977
That's it.

1624
01:57:16,138 --> 01:57:17,096
Amrita.

1625
01:57:19,853 --> 01:57:21,690
Bad luck for the big guys.

1626
01:57:21,850 --> 01:57:25,045
This stuff just happens to
stop human aging. Like...

1627
01:57:25,525 --> 01:57:26,924
stops it.

1628
01:57:29,282 --> 01:57:31,401
Ounce for ounce the
single most valuable...

1629
01:57:31,481 --> 01:57:33,398
substance known to man.

1630
01:57:35,036 --> 01:57:36,954
This little vial here is worth like...

1631
01:57:38,072 --> 01:57:39,312
80 million.

1632
01:57:40,309 --> 01:57:41,108
Think fast!

1633
01:57:42,388 --> 01:57:43,507
Please don't.

1634
01:57:44,664 --> 01:57:45,502
It's never funny.

1635
01:57:46,502 --> 01:57:49,539
Amrita is what's paying for
everything here on Pandora now.

1636
01:57:50,457 --> 01:57:52,816
Even your research.
Ain't that right, Dr. G?

1637
01:57:53,015 --> 01:57:54,215
It's why I drink.

1638
01:57:56,531 --> 01:57:57,570
That's all you take?

1639
01:57:58,809 --> 01:58:00,766
I mean, you just waste the rest?

1640
01:58:02,285 --> 01:58:03,723
Drop the bags.

1641
01:58:04,363 --> 01:58:05,441
Let's sink her!

1642
01:58:05,600 --> 01:58:07,560
No. Leave the bags.

1643
01:58:07,959 --> 01:58:09,637
I want 'em to know it was us.

1644
01:58:10,356 --> 01:58:13,514
I charge extra for bein' used as bait.

1645
01:58:46,395 --> 01:58:48,752
Her name is Ro'a.

1646
01:58:51,070 --> 01:58:53,748
She was my Spirit Sister.

1647
01:58:56,106 --> 01:58:58,661
She was a composer of songs.

1648
01:58:58,902 --> 01:59:00,141
Much revered.

1649
01:59:00,302 --> 01:59:01,420
We would sing together.

1650
01:59:03,095 --> 01:59:06,574
She waited many breeding
cycles to have this calf.

1651
01:59:07,052 --> 01:59:09,209
The clan were so happy for her.

1652
01:59:12,207 --> 01:59:14,044
What is this, Tonowari?

1653
01:59:16,642 --> 01:59:18,280
What is this?

1654
01:59:37,020 --> 01:59:39,816
My Spirit Sister and her baby...

1655
01:59:39,975 --> 01:59:42,415
have been murdered by the Sky People!

1656
01:59:43,653 --> 01:59:45,847
This war has come to us.

1657
01:59:46,568 --> 01:59:48,126
We knew about this hunting...

1658
01:59:48,247 --> 01:59:49,924
of our tulkun people.

1659
01:59:50,083 --> 01:59:51,323
But it was over the horizon...

1660
01:59:51,803 --> 01:59:52,882
far away.

1661
01:59:53,041 --> 01:59:54,758
Now it is here!

1662
01:59:58,317 --> 01:59:59,275
No, you don't...

1663
01:59:59,435 --> 02:00:01,472
You gotta understand
how the Sky People think.

1664
02:00:01,631 --> 02:00:03,271
They don't care about the Great Balance.

1665
02:00:03,431 --> 02:00:04,910
We don't answer to Sky People!

1666
02:00:05,108 --> 02:00:06,826
Listen. Listen to him.

1667
02:00:07,026 --> 02:00:08,105
The Sky People are not gonna stop.

1668
02:00:08,225 --> 02:00:09,144
This is only the beginning.

1669
02:00:09,264 --> 02:00:11,220
You gotta tell your tulkun to leave.

1670
02:00:12,299 --> 02:00:14,219
You gotta tell them to go far away!

1671
02:00:14,578 --> 02:00:15,257
Leave?

1672
02:00:16,935 --> 02:00:18,053
You live among us...

1673
02:00:19,133 --> 02:00:20,850
and you learn nothing!

1674
02:00:20,969 --> 02:00:24,006
We will fight to protect
our brothers and sisters!

1675
02:00:24,206 --> 02:00:25,285
No, no, no.

1676
02:00:26,842 --> 02:00:27,882
If you attack...

1677
02:00:28,082 --> 02:00:29,640
if you fight...

1678
02:00:29,839 --> 02:00:31,158
then they will destroy you!

1679
02:00:31,277 --> 02:00:32,077
They will destroy...

1680
02:00:32,196 --> 02:00:33,194
everything that you love.

1681
02:00:34,116 --> 02:00:34,754
No!

1682
02:00:34,875 --> 02:00:35,994
You hear my words!

1683
02:00:36,513 --> 02:00:37,471
Hear my words!

1684
02:00:37,712 --> 02:00:38,631
Stay calm.

1685
02:00:38,830 --> 02:00:39,591
Stay calm!

1686
02:00:40,229 --> 02:00:41,189
Listen to my father.

1687
02:00:41,349 --> 02:00:42,186
Damn it!

1688
02:00:42,305 --> 02:00:43,544
He speaks the truth.

1689
02:00:53,173 --> 02:00:54,371
You tell the tulkun...

1690
02:00:56,171 --> 02:00:57,489
that if they're hit
by one of these...

1691
02:00:57,609 --> 02:00:58,808
they're marked for death.

1692
02:01:01,766 --> 02:01:02,564
And call for me...

1693
02:01:02,724 --> 02:01:03,884
I'll silence it.

1694
02:01:06,401 --> 02:01:08,196
Saving their lives,
that's all that matters.

1695
02:01:09,234 --> 02:01:10,514
Right?

1696
02:01:12,912 --> 02:01:14,508
Saving your family.

1697
02:01:26,897 --> 02:01:28,015
Tell the tulkun.

1698
02:01:29,213 --> 02:01:30,172
Go.

1699
02:01:30,652 --> 02:01:31,691
Go!

1700
02:01:35,126 --> 02:01:36,725
We must fight.

1701
02:01:37,804 --> 02:01:39,322
MaJake.

1702
02:01:39,442 --> 02:01:41,041
I will not stand and do nothing!

1703
02:01:41,801 --> 02:01:43,959
It's a trap.
They want us to hit back.

1704
02:01:44,637 --> 02:01:46,155
They're not hunting tulkun.

1705
02:01:46,275 --> 02:01:47,794
They're hunting us.

1706
02:02:01,698 --> 02:02:03,497
No way you're rolling
out of here, baby brother.

1707
02:02:03,697 --> 02:02:05,215
I have to warn Payakan about the pingers.

1708
02:02:05,772 --> 02:02:06,532
No.

1709
02:02:06,692 --> 02:02:08,490
You've gotta keep
your skxawng ass here.

1710
02:02:08,730 --> 02:02:09,729
He's outcast.

1711
02:02:09,888 --> 02:02:11,485
There's nobody to warn him but me.

1712
02:02:11,724 --> 02:02:12,405
Bro...

1713
02:02:13,684 --> 02:02:15,642
why do you always have
to make things so hard?

1714
02:02:17,080 --> 02:02:18,079
No.

1715
02:02:18,279 --> 02:02:20,756
You mean why can't I be
the perfect son like you?

1716
02:02:22,074 --> 02:02:23,472
The perfect little soldier.

1717
02:02:24,233 --> 02:02:25,432
Well, I'm not you!

1718
02:02:26,071 --> 02:02:26,869
Okay?

1719
02:02:27,469 --> 02:02:28,227
I'm not you.

1720
02:02:29,587 --> 02:02:30,906
He's my brother.

1721
02:02:31,065 --> 02:02:32,063
I'm going.

1722
02:02:32,182 --> 02:02:33,462
He's your brother?

1723
02:02:34,661 --> 02:02:36,419
No, I'm your brother.

1724
02:02:36,657 --> 02:02:37,377
Lo'ak!

1725
02:02:37,977 --> 02:02:39,016
Get off me.

1726
02:02:40,136 --> 02:02:40,974
Lo'ak!

1727
02:02:41,094 --> 02:02:41,813
Come back!

1728
02:02:41,893 --> 02:02:42,533
Come on.

1729
02:02:42,612 --> 02:02:43,651
He's going to Payakan.

1730
02:02:55,198 --> 02:02:56,236
Come back!

1731
02:02:57,356 --> 02:02:58,833
There's Lo'ak!
Lo'ak.

1732
02:02:59,111 --> 02:03:00,111
Lo'ak!

1733
02:03:00,272 --> 02:03:01,831
Lo'ak's going to find Payakan!

1734
02:03:02,190 --> 02:03:03,029
Wait up!

1735
02:03:04,668 --> 02:03:05,346
Hold on!

1736
02:03:14,295 --> 02:03:16,013
-All crews to stations.
-Sound general call.

1737
02:03:16,134 --> 02:03:18,212
All right, people. Come on.
Let's make some money!

1738
02:03:26,764 --> 02:03:27,722
Brother!

1739
02:03:28,042 --> 02:03:28,722
Lo'ak!

1740
02:03:30,718 --> 02:03:31,478
Lo'ak!

1741
02:03:31,560 --> 02:03:32,357
Wait!

1742
02:03:35,513 --> 02:03:36,751
What is it?
What's wrong?

1743
02:03:38,670 --> 02:03:39,826
Shit!

1744
02:03:40,386 --> 02:03:42,226
Stay calm.
Stay calm.

1745
02:03:42,984 --> 02:03:44,144
I got this.

1746
02:03:50,376 --> 02:03:51,295
Shit!

1747
02:03:55,329 --> 02:03:56,488
Bro, come on!
Help me out!

1748
02:03:57,088 --> 02:03:58,009
Hurry, the ship's coming!

1749
02:03:58,128 --> 02:03:58,926
They're over there!

1750
02:04:01,242 --> 02:04:02,401
Bro, come on!

1751
02:04:03,320 --> 02:04:04,600
Bro.

1752
02:04:04,680 --> 02:04:05,399
Come on, bro.

1753
02:04:05,479 --> 02:04:06,119
Hurry!

1754
02:04:06,518 --> 02:04:07,517
Call it in!

1755
02:04:07,677 --> 02:04:08,517
Call Dad!

1756
02:04:09,036 --> 02:04:10,114
Call Dad!
Just go! Do it!

1757
02:04:10,275 --> 02:04:11,313
Just do it.

1758
02:04:12,113 --> 02:04:13,990
Dad. I mean, Devil Dog.
Do you read me?

1759
02:04:14,150 --> 02:04:15,308
Did you see where they went?

1760
02:04:15,469 --> 02:04:16,307
It's Eagle Eye, do you copy?

1761
02:04:16,466 --> 02:04:17,785
-They went outside the reef.
-Yeah, Lo'ak.

1762
02:04:17,945 --> 02:04:18,584
Dad!

1763
02:04:19,943 --> 02:04:22,139
We're with a tulkun
that's under attack.

1764
02:04:22,300 --> 02:04:23,339
Killer ship's inbound.

1765
02:04:23,500 --> 02:04:24,819
It's about two klicks out.

1766
02:04:25,297 --> 02:04:25,976
Who's with you?

1767
02:04:26,056 --> 02:04:26,695
It's all of us.

1768
02:04:26,935 --> 02:04:28,174
Aonung and Tsireya too.

1769
02:04:28,334 --> 02:04:29,733
We're at Three Brothers Rocks.

1770
02:04:29,894 --> 02:04:31,691
You get to cover,
and you do not engage.

1771
02:04:31,850 --> 02:04:32,688
All right? You hear me?

1772
02:04:32,849 --> 02:04:33,847
Do not engage.
We're comin'.

1773
02:04:33,968 --> 02:04:34,807
Yes, sir.

1774
02:04:34,926 --> 02:04:35,967
It's getting closer!

1775
02:04:36,086 --> 02:04:38,122
-Three, two, pull!
-Pull!

1776
02:04:39,042 --> 02:04:40,441
Kids are under attack!

1777
02:04:40,920 --> 02:04:42,756
The kids are under attack.
They were defending a tulkun.

1778
02:04:42,916 --> 02:04:44,114
It's your kids too.

1779
02:04:44,275 --> 02:04:45,234
The demon ship?

1780
02:04:45,314 --> 02:04:45,954
Yes!

1781
02:04:46,034 --> 02:04:46,672
We gotta go!

1782
02:04:46,833 --> 02:04:48,470
Weapons.
Sound the alarm!

1783
02:04:52,507 --> 02:04:53,544
You should stay back.

1784
02:04:53,906 --> 02:04:54,743
I ride!

1785
02:04:55,023 --> 02:04:55,663
Come!

1786
02:05:43,010 --> 02:05:44,807
Sub teams, hatches close.

1787
02:05:44,926 --> 02:05:46,284
Two-minute warning.

1788
02:05:52,961 --> 02:05:53,919
Aonung!

1789
02:05:54,838 --> 02:05:55,837
Hurry up! Come on!

1790
02:05:56,036 --> 02:05:57,155
Bro, hurry up!

1791
02:05:59,514 --> 02:06:00,233
Go, go, go!

1792
02:06:04,188 --> 02:06:05,345
Pull! Now!

1793
02:06:07,182 --> 02:06:08,861
-Everybody! Together!
-Pull!

1794
02:06:12,577 --> 02:06:13,817
I'll be damned.

1795
02:06:15,016 --> 02:06:16,214
Sully's kids.

1796
02:06:16,653 --> 02:06:18,251
Let's roll.
Not you.

1797
02:06:18,812 --> 02:06:19,771
Saddle up.

1798
02:06:30,996 --> 02:06:32,634
Range is 700 meters.

1799
02:06:32,794 --> 02:06:34,232
Pinger signal is good.

1800
02:06:36,032 --> 02:06:37,429
Pull, harder!

1801
02:06:37,589 --> 02:06:38,708
Pull!

1802
02:06:39,468 --> 02:06:40,707
Pull, harder!

1803
02:06:40,827 --> 02:06:41,785
Go!

1804
02:06:42,225 --> 02:06:43,781
It's out!
Kiri, it's out!

1805
02:06:43,901 --> 02:06:44,860
Go.
Tuk, go.

1806
02:06:45,340 --> 02:06:46,899
Come on. Get out of here!

1807
02:06:47,059 --> 02:06:48,017
Go that way!

1808
02:06:48,137 --> 02:06:48,776
I'll draw
them off.

1809
02:06:48,857 --> 02:06:50,136
-Okay.
-Lo'ak, come.

1810
02:06:51,774 --> 02:06:53,053
Go, go, dive!

1811
02:06:53,212 --> 02:06:54,450
Now, dive!

1812
02:06:54,531 --> 02:06:55,328
Grab on.

1813
02:07:04,918 --> 02:07:05,957
Range 300.

1814
02:07:06,119 --> 02:07:07,756
Ready depth charges...

1815
02:07:07,916 --> 02:07:10,152
and fire, fire, fire.

1816
02:07:15,829 --> 02:07:17,107
No depth charges.

1817
02:07:17,267 --> 02:07:18,505
Scoresby,
you copy?

1818
02:07:18,625 --> 02:07:20,102
These kids are
worthless to me dead.

1819
02:07:20,740 --> 02:07:22,020
Hold your fire.

1820
02:07:26,493 --> 02:07:29,092
Circle out. Get a cordon around 'em.

1821
02:07:29,292 --> 02:07:30,529
Get your subs in the water.

1822
02:07:31,407 --> 02:07:33,287
Sub teams, get wet.

1823
02:08:20,674 --> 02:08:22,631
Crabs flank right.
Get around on 'em.

1824
02:08:26,269 --> 02:08:27,545
Don't lose 'em.
Stay on 'em now.

1825
02:08:27,945 --> 02:08:28,985
Planes up. We're goin' in!

1826
02:08:29,183 --> 02:08:30,464
Oh, hell yeah!

1827
02:09:00,870 --> 02:09:02,589
Tone on lock.
Two away.

1828
02:09:30,954 --> 02:09:31,873
Where is Tuk?

1829
02:09:31,993 --> 02:09:32,793
Did you see her?

1830
02:09:48,738 --> 02:09:49,695
Tuk!

1831
02:09:52,292 --> 02:09:53,170
Target in sight.

1832
02:09:57,525 --> 02:09:58,683
It is coming.

1833
02:09:58,844 --> 02:10:00,083
We gotta go!

1834
02:10:15,746 --> 02:10:16,783
-Switch net.
-Switching.

1835
02:10:16,903 --> 02:10:17,582
Fire.

1836
02:10:37,282 --> 02:10:37,960
Hold on!

1837
02:10:38,361 --> 02:10:39,198
Let me out!

1838
02:10:39,717 --> 02:10:40,678
-Watch out!
-Tuk, move!

1839
02:10:40,877 --> 02:10:41,757
Move your hand! Move your hand!

1840
02:10:41,917 --> 02:10:43,555
-Cut it!
-Hurry, hurry!

1841
02:10:47,871 --> 02:10:49,427
Hey, kid, get back here!

1842
02:10:54,860 --> 02:10:55,499
Drop the weapon.

1843
02:10:55,620 --> 02:10:56,500
-Put the weapon down!
-Put it down.

1844
02:10:56,861 --> 02:10:57,659
Put it down!

1845
02:10:59,776 --> 02:11:00,494
Stay down.

1846
02:11:01,414 --> 02:11:03,212
-Hey, kid, get back here!
-Get him! Get him!

1847
02:11:03,413 --> 02:11:04,570
Put the weapon down!

1848
02:11:05,049 --> 02:11:05,889
Drop it, now!

1849
02:11:06,128 --> 02:11:07,408
-Put it down!
-Drop the knife.

1850
02:11:07,528 --> 02:11:08,487
Drop it.

1851
02:11:09,085 --> 02:11:10,923
Hey! Hey, what are
you doing? Stop!

1852
02:11:11,083 --> 02:11:12,163
Stop.
Don't hurt them.

1853
02:11:13,682 --> 02:11:14,359
Stop moving.

1854
02:11:14,519 --> 02:11:16,476
-Spider!
-Bro, you okay?

1855
02:11:16,876 --> 02:11:18,116
Yeah. Great, cuz.

1856
02:11:18,316 --> 02:11:19,314
Never better.

1857
02:11:22,032 --> 02:11:22,992
Knock it off.
Stay still.

1858
02:11:25,748 --> 02:11:26,708
Get back
to the bridge.

1859
02:11:28,305 --> 02:11:29,265
Keep him there!

1860
02:11:29,424 --> 02:11:30,782
I'm going,
I'm going.

1861
02:11:31,901 --> 02:11:33,020
Yeah.

1862
02:11:33,140 --> 02:11:34,219
I remember you.

1863
02:11:35,337 --> 02:11:36,856
Cuff 'em to the
rail. All of 'em.

1864
02:11:37,014 --> 02:11:37,694
Let's go.

1865
02:11:38,614 --> 02:11:39,772
Let's go. Move!

1866
02:11:39,852 --> 02:11:40,569
Over here.

1867
02:11:40,649 --> 02:11:41,610
Watch 'em.
They bite.

1868
02:11:42,367 --> 02:11:43,168
Get on your knees.

1869
02:11:43,247 --> 02:11:43,887
On 'em.

1870
02:11:43,968 --> 02:11:44,685
Give me your hand.

1871
02:11:44,765 --> 02:11:45,445
No!

1872
02:11:46,643 --> 02:11:47,324
Now the other.

1873
02:11:47,443 --> 02:11:48,404
No.

1874
02:11:52,198 --> 02:11:53,158
Be brave.

1875
02:11:57,589 --> 02:11:58,630
Na'vi inbound!

1876
02:12:00,949 --> 02:12:01,825
Spread out. Weapons up.

1877
02:12:01,906 --> 02:12:02,545
Dad!

1878
02:12:02,705 --> 02:12:04,304
Push left. Spread out.

1879
02:12:06,582 --> 02:12:07,541
Stop.
Stop them.

1880
02:12:11,457 --> 02:12:12,736
It's Sully.

1881
02:12:14,973 --> 02:12:15,932
300 yards.

1882
02:12:21,645 --> 02:12:22,922
They got our kids.

1883
02:12:23,082 --> 02:12:24,362
Your daughter.

1884
02:12:24,481 --> 02:12:25,440
Tuk. Lo'ak.

1885
02:12:28,238 --> 02:12:28,877
Jake...

1886
02:12:29,476 --> 02:12:31,516
tell your friends to stand down.

1887
02:12:32,553 --> 02:12:34,429
You want your kids back...

1888
02:12:34,590 --> 02:12:36,150
you come out alone.

1889
02:12:38,785 --> 02:12:40,824
You know better
than to test my resolve.

1890
02:12:42,102 --> 02:12:43,181
Lo'ak!
No!

1891
02:12:46,137 --> 02:12:48,014
I took you under my wing, Jake.

1892
02:12:48,534 --> 02:12:50,372
You betrayed me.

1893
02:12:50,532 --> 02:12:51,813
You killed your own.

1894
02:12:52,011 --> 02:12:53,730
Good men.
Good women.

1895
02:12:53,929 --> 02:12:56,886
I will not hesitate
to execute your kid.

1896
02:12:58,366 --> 02:12:59,323
Just wait one.

1897
02:13:10,151 --> 02:13:11,231
Hold here.

1898
02:13:12,190 --> 02:13:13,988
They are
killers of tulkun.

1899
02:13:14,586 --> 02:13:15,705
They must die.

1900
02:13:15,905 --> 02:13:17,582
Here. Today.

1901
02:13:17,744 --> 02:13:19,343
It's me that they want.

1902
02:13:19,462 --> 02:13:20,978
That's what all this
has been about, all right?

1903
02:13:21,138 --> 02:13:23,376
The hunting of our tulkun.
The taking of our kids.

1904
02:13:26,371 --> 02:13:28,251
You brought
this upon us!

1905
02:13:28,690 --> 02:13:29,729
You!

1906
02:13:33,407 --> 02:13:35,083
Well, then it's me
that has to do this.

1907
02:13:41,116 --> 02:13:42,833
Offer's fixin' to expire.

1908
02:13:43,034 --> 02:13:44,432
What's it gonna be?

1909
02:13:45,231 --> 02:13:46,548
Check your fire.

1910
02:13:46,709 --> 02:13:47,907
I'm comin' out.

1911
02:13:58,498 --> 02:13:59,176
MaJake...

1912
02:13:59,296 --> 02:14:00,056
what is happening?

1913
02:14:00,935 --> 02:14:01,972
MaJake?

1914
02:14:04,531 --> 02:14:07,167
Stay tense everybody.
All weapons.

1915
02:14:23,706 --> 02:14:25,266
Easy shot.

1916
02:14:25,825 --> 02:14:27,822
You hit him
now, they attack.

1917
02:14:29,101 --> 02:14:30,980
Wait till
he's on board.

1918
02:14:56,593 --> 02:14:57,992
Payakan!

1919
02:15:09,138 --> 02:15:10,055
Open fire.
Open fire!

1920
02:15:12,533 --> 02:15:13,253
Brother!

1921
02:15:18,089 --> 02:15:19,566
-Come about!
-Comin' about!

1922
02:15:19,726 --> 02:15:21,045
Get me around!

1923
02:15:21,803 --> 02:15:22,524
Get me a shot!

1924
02:15:23,642 --> 02:15:25,358
Go, go!

1925
02:15:43,302 --> 02:15:44,340
Get me around!

1926
02:15:44,499 --> 02:15:45,937
Go, go, go!

1927
02:15:47,575 --> 02:15:48,213
Get in there...

1928
02:15:48,293 --> 02:15:50,133
get me in range.
Go, go, go.

1929
02:15:58,882 --> 02:15:59,563
Down!

1930
02:16:02,798 --> 02:16:04,237
Bloody hell!

1931
02:16:08,230 --> 02:16:09,029
Open fire!

1932
02:16:09,830 --> 02:16:10,508
Open fire!

1933
02:16:14,705 --> 02:16:15,863
Sully's inbound.

1934
02:16:15,983 --> 02:16:17,142
I want eyes on!

1935
02:16:17,422 --> 02:16:19,260
All right, let's go.
Saddle up. We're up!

1936
02:16:59,413 --> 02:17:01,451
Somebody shoot something!

1937
02:17:16,475 --> 02:17:17,115
Stop!

1938
02:18:10,616 --> 02:18:11,814
Get after them. Go!

1939
02:18:28,237 --> 02:18:30,113
Breach!
Masks on!

1940
02:18:30,394 --> 02:18:31,834
Masks on!
Go!

1941
02:19:09,869 --> 02:19:11,148
Get him out of here!

1942
02:19:15,982 --> 02:19:16,942
Calm down!

1943
02:19:30,606 --> 02:19:31,644
Go, go, go!

1944
02:19:44,670 --> 02:19:45,868
Damage report!

1945
02:19:45,949 --> 02:19:46,747
Flooding.

1946
02:19:46,868 --> 02:19:47,746
Compartment two and three.

1947
02:19:48,226 --> 02:19:48,946
You okay?

1948
02:20:17,514 --> 02:20:18,471
Port bow!

1949
02:20:19,512 --> 02:20:20,551
Hard port!

1950
02:20:20,670 --> 02:20:21,310
Open fire!

1951
02:20:22,308 --> 02:20:23,466
Get me a shot!

1952
02:20:24,464 --> 02:20:25,103
Got ya!

1953
02:20:42,206 --> 02:20:43,724
Cut us away!

1954
02:20:43,843 --> 02:20:44,921
Not responding!

1955
02:20:45,281 --> 02:20:47,000
Get us off the cable!

1956
02:20:47,160 --> 02:20:48,999
Who's got the harpoon now?

1957
02:20:53,236 --> 02:20:54,432
Back full!

1958
02:21:05,539 --> 02:21:06,617
Reload!

1959
02:21:09,736 --> 02:21:11,493
Not the cable,
you idiot!

1960
02:21:12,732 --> 02:21:13,851
We're dead
in the water.

1961
02:21:15,090 --> 02:21:16,687
Taking on water. Pumps on.

1962
02:21:17,366 --> 02:21:18,646
Man your
weapons!

1963
02:21:18,806 --> 02:21:21,002
I thought you were the
intelligent species here, Scoresby.

1964
02:21:21,240 --> 02:21:22,720
Shut ya cakehole,
Garvin.

1965
02:21:24,759 --> 02:21:25,876
Where are you?

1966
02:21:26,594 --> 02:21:27,792
Cheeky bugger.

1967
02:21:27,954 --> 02:21:29,793
You think you're
pretty clever, don't ya?

1968
02:21:44,498 --> 02:21:45,536
Get down!

1969
02:21:57,122 --> 02:21:58,082
Pumps aren't working.

1970
02:21:58,282 --> 02:21:59,960
Abandon ship!

1971
02:22:00,120 --> 02:22:01,359
-Get him to a boat!
-All crew to the boats.

1972
02:22:01,517 --> 02:22:03,314
Let's go, people!
Let's move! Mask up!

1973
02:22:08,589 --> 02:22:09,747
Neteyam!

1974
02:22:10,348 --> 02:22:11,386
Hey,
baby brother.

1975
02:22:11,546 --> 02:22:12,585
Need some help?

1976
02:22:12,984 --> 02:22:13,983
Shut up. Come on.

1977
02:22:14,143 --> 02:22:14,862
Get us loose.

1978
02:22:17,818 --> 02:22:19,936
-Okay, get Tuk out of here.
-Bro, hurry up!

1979
02:22:21,655 --> 02:22:23,172
Who's the Mighty Warrior?
Come on.

1980
02:22:23,291 --> 02:22:24,051
Say it.

1981
02:22:24,690 --> 02:22:25,970
-Bro!
-Come on. Let's go.

1982
02:22:27,728 --> 02:22:28,726
Lo'ak!

1983
02:22:29,566 --> 02:22:30,523
They've
got Spider.

1984
02:22:30,684 --> 02:22:32,323
We've gotta get him.
Come on.

1985
02:22:32,683 --> 02:22:33,641
Come on, bro.

1986
02:22:33,761 --> 02:22:34,921
We can't
leave him.

1987
02:22:42,713 --> 02:22:43,711
Let me go!

1988
02:22:45,868 --> 02:22:47,026
No!

1989
02:22:49,064 --> 02:22:49,902
Look!

1990
02:22:56,497 --> 02:22:58,016
Let's go, buttercup.
Get up.

1991
02:22:58,254 --> 02:23:00,331
I'm not your
buttercup, perv!

1992
02:23:00,491 --> 02:23:01,649
We've got to go
back for her.

1993
02:23:02,689 --> 02:23:03,689
Tuk, wait!

1994
02:23:03,809 --> 02:23:05,365
Sullys
stick together.

1995
02:23:16,592 --> 02:23:17,992
Wait right there, guys. Wait.

1996
02:23:18,952 --> 02:23:19,991
Clear to drop!

1997
02:23:21,388 --> 02:23:22,587
Check your mask.
Make sure it's tight.

1998
02:23:22,666 --> 02:23:23,746
I'm good,
dumbass.

1999
02:23:26,781 --> 02:23:27,741
Move, move!

2000
02:23:27,941 --> 02:23:29,060
Evacuating,
people.

2001
02:23:33,173 --> 02:23:33,854
Tuk...

2002
02:23:34,093 --> 02:23:35,611
this is not a good idea.

2003
02:23:35,732 --> 02:23:36,651
Tuk!

2004
02:23:56,068 --> 02:23:56,908
Cut it here.

2005
02:24:00,024 --> 02:24:00,665
No!

2006
02:24:06,738 --> 02:24:07,695
I got her.

2007
02:24:14,049 --> 02:24:15,208
We can still
get this done.

2008
02:24:15,367 --> 02:24:16,288
Hell yeah.

2009
02:24:17,126 --> 02:24:19,444
I can't believe
I'm tied up again!

2010
02:24:44,536 --> 02:24:45,454
Bro, come on.

2011
02:24:45,534 --> 02:24:46,172
Let's go.

2012
02:24:49,728 --> 02:24:50,566
Thanks, guys.

2013
02:24:53,006 --> 02:24:53,645
Go!

2014
02:24:53,724 --> 02:24:54,444
No!

2015
02:24:54,563 --> 02:24:55,561
-Bro, come on!
-Go, go, go!

2016
02:24:56,720 --> 02:24:58,120
Go, go, go!

2017
02:25:00,637 --> 02:25:01,596
Give me that!

2018
02:25:05,552 --> 02:25:06,551
Go, go, go!

2019
02:25:07,270 --> 02:25:08,230
This way.

2020
02:25:15,501 --> 02:25:16,458
Cover, cover!

2021
02:25:22,293 --> 02:25:23,251
You see 'em?

2022
02:25:33,680 --> 02:25:34,641

They have Kiri and Tuk.

2040
02:26:16,434 --> 02:26:17,392
I can't go back.

2041
02:26:24,624 --> 02:26:25,583
Dad!

2042
02:26:26,464 --> 02:26:27,702
Dad, help!
It's Neteyam!

2043
02:26:27,821 --> 02:26:28,818
Hurry!

2044
02:26:29,018 --> 02:26:30,336
Here! Take him.

2045
02:26:32,336 --> 02:26:33,972
-Oh, no.
-It's Neteyam! He's hurt!

2046
02:26:34,131 --> 02:26:35,290

-Come on. Come on!

2047
02:26:35,409 --> 02:26:36,408
Hurry, please!

02:26:37,249 --> 02:26:37,887
Pull!

2049
02:26:40,446 --> 02:26:41,604

Pull!

Come on!

2052
02:26:47,560 --> 02:26:48,798
Just watch his head.

2053
02:26:49,437 --> 02:26:50,074
Okay.

2054
02:26:50,995 --> 02:26:51,673
It's okay, bro.

2055
02:26:51,793 --> 02:26:52,473
We got you.

2056
02:26:53,232 --> 02:26:53,872
Oh, no.

2057
02:26:56,066 --> 02:26:56,987
Put pressure.

2058
02:26:57,105 --> 02:26:57,787
Put pressure on it.

2059
02:26:59,864 --> 02:27:00,982
Dad, I...

2060
02:27:01,102 --> 02:27:01,941
It's okay.
I'm here.

2061
02:27:04,299 --> 02:27:05,458
No, no, no.

2062
02:27:05,658 --> 02:27:06,657
It's okay, son.
I gotcha.

2063
02:27:12,371 --> 02:27:13,331
I want to go home.

2064
02:27:16,085 --> 02:27:17,164
I know. I know.

2065
02:27:17,284 --> 02:27:18,162
It's okay, we're goin' home.

2066
02:27:18,763 --> 02:27:19,801
We're goin' home.

2067
02:27:23,195 --> 02:27:24,355
It's okay. It's okay.

2068
02:27:24,477 --> 02:27:25,435
Dad, I...

2069
02:27:32,268 --> 02:27:33,226
Neteyam...

2070
02:27:38,261 --> 02:27:42,096
No. No, no, no.
Neteyam!

2071
02:27:49,408 --> 02:27:50,927
Oh, Great Mother.

2072
02:27:51,087 --> 02:27:52,127
No, Great Mother.

2073
02:27:52,926 --> 02:27:54,363
Please.

2074
02:27:55,963 --> 02:27:57,321
Oh, my son.

2075
02:27:57,441 --> 02:27:58,877
My son.

2076
02:27:58,997 --> 02:27:59,916
No!

2077
02:28:05,550 --> 02:28:07,069
My son!

2078
02:28:10,345 --> 02:28:11,744
No!

2079
02:28:13,381 --> 02:28:14,979
No!

2080
02:28:15,579 --> 02:28:17,698
Can you hear me, Corporal?

2081
02:28:19,774 --> 02:28:22,371
Yeah, yeah,
I think you can.

2082
02:28:23,331 --> 02:28:24,488
I got your daughters.

2083
02:28:27,126 --> 02:28:28,445
Same deal as before.

2084
02:28:30,043 --> 02:28:31,003
You for them.

2085
02:28:32,162 --> 02:28:33,840
No!

2086
02:28:36,115 --> 02:28:37,435
Where are your sisters?

2087
02:28:39,314 --> 02:28:40,830
Your sisters.
Where are they?

2088
02:28:41,669 --> 02:28:42,629
I don't know.

2089
02:28:42,829 --> 02:28:43,908
-Where are they?
-They're on the ship.

2090
02:28:44,068 --> 02:28:45,825
They're tied up on the ship.

2091
02:28:45,946 --> 02:28:47,104
They're at the moon pool.

2092
02:28:47,704 --> 02:28:49,701
At the well deck. Midships.

2093
02:28:49,862 --> 02:28:50,661
What?

2094
02:28:51,180 --> 02:28:52,298
Come on. I'll show you.

2095
02:28:52,859 --> 02:28:53,698
Come on.

2096
02:28:53,778 --> 02:28:54,417
I'll show you.

2097
02:28:54,497 --> 02:28:55,734
Talk to me, Corporal.

2098
02:28:55,973 --> 02:28:57,373
-Z, up top.
-I need somethin', Jake...

2099
02:28:57,533 --> 02:28:59,092
or there's gonna be consequences.

2100
02:29:00,051 --> 02:29:01,008
Yeah, I hear you.

2101
02:29:02,088 --> 02:29:03,046
-Come on.
-Come on!

2102
02:29:03,167 --> 02:29:05,284
Let's go. We gotta go.
Come on, let's go.

2103
02:29:05,681 --> 02:29:06,961
-No!
-Let's go.

2104
02:29:07,120 --> 02:29:09,799
Listen. Listen. Listen to me.

2105
02:29:12,637 --> 02:29:13,436
Listen to me. Listen to me.

2106
02:29:13,514 --> 02:29:16,111
They have our daughters.

2107
02:29:19,228 --> 02:29:21,265
I need you with me.

2108
02:29:22,423 --> 02:29:23,982
And I need you to be strong.

2109
02:29:24,423 --> 02:29:25,860
Right now.

2110
02:29:26,020 --> 02:29:27,138
Strong heart.

2111
02:29:28,496 --> 02:29:29,695
Strong heart.

2112
02:29:42,762 --> 02:29:44,079
Let's go get our daughters.

2113
02:29:58,385 --> 02:29:59,822
You stay with your brother.

2114
02:30:00,343 --> 02:30:01,662
Dad, I want to go with you.

2115
02:30:04,536 --> 02:30:05,495
You've done enough.

2116
02:30:05,656 --> 02:30:06,655
Dad...

2117
02:30:11,249 --> 02:30:12,209
Hold fire.

2118
02:30:13,447 --> 02:30:14,406
Let's go.

2119
02:30:15,445 --> 02:30:16,406
He's coming.

2120
02:30:18,203 --> 02:30:19,081
I'm good. Go, go!

2121
02:30:21,440 --> 02:30:22,519
Let's get this guy.

2122
02:30:22,639 --> 02:30:23,797
It's what we came here for.

2123
02:30:28,791 --> 02:30:29,749
Stay with him.

2124
02:30:30,269 --> 02:30:31,267
No...

2125
02:30:32,146 --> 02:30:33,347
Heads on a swivel, guys.

2126
02:30:53,803 --> 02:30:54,442
Go.

2127
02:31:02,592 --> 02:31:03,551
Where are they?

2128
02:31:03,751 --> 02:31:04,392
The middle deck.

2129
02:31:04,512 --> 02:31:05,390
Where they launch the subs.

2130
02:31:05,551 --> 02:31:06,906
There's, like, a pool in the center.

2131
02:31:07,826 --> 02:31:08,906
They're at the forward railing.

2132
02:31:11,382 --> 02:31:12,342
No, no.
Stay here.

2133
02:31:15,379 --> 02:31:16,458
Talk to me, Corporal.

2134
02:31:17,376 --> 02:31:18,415
This ship's going down...

2135
02:31:18,576 --> 02:31:19,775
and your girls with it.

2136
02:31:21,373 --> 02:31:22,970
Your boy didn't have to die.

2137
02:31:23,290 --> 02:31:24,969
You brought that on yourself.

2138
02:31:31,800 --> 02:31:34,518
You thought you could keep
your family safe, but you can't.

2139
02:31:36,796 --> 02:31:38,393
Only one way to keep them safe.

2140
02:31:42,150 --> 02:31:44,065
So let's get this over with before

2141
02:31:44,146 --> 02:31:45,107
you lose another kid.

2142
02:31:56,333 --> 02:31:57,411
Get down!

2143
02:32:38,046 --> 02:32:39,043
-Who's down?
-Zdinarsik, you copy?

2144
02:32:39,163 --> 02:32:40,163
Sound off!

2145
02:32:40,364 --> 02:32:41,042
Clear!

2146
02:32:42,320 --> 02:32:43,640
Prager.
You read?

2147
02:32:45,597 --> 02:32:46,556
Eyes up.
Eyes up!

2148
02:32:55,387 --> 02:32:56,345
Move up!

2149
02:32:58,863 --> 02:32:59,823
Push left. Go!

2150
02:33:00,462 --> 02:33:01,619
Push right. Get around on her.

2151
02:33:02,019 --> 02:33:02,860
Who's got eyes?

2152
02:33:46,490 --> 02:33:47,130
MaJake.

2153
02:33:53,601 --> 02:33:54,639
It's Mom!

2154
02:34:00,875 --> 02:34:01,953
That's right.

2155
02:34:02,232 --> 02:34:04,110
They're coming for you.

2156
02:34:52,857 --> 02:34:53,815
Dad! Dad.

2157
02:34:56,970 --> 02:34:58,168
Okay.
Where's your sister?

2158
02:34:58,248 --> 02:34:59,010
Where is she?
Where is she?

2159
02:34:59,089 --> 02:35:00,528
That way.
That way.

2160
02:35:00,927 --> 02:35:01,885
Okay, stay behind me.

2161
02:35:07,001 --> 02:35:07,920
Kiri!

2162
02:35:09,120 --> 02:35:10,557
Runnin' out of time here, Corporal.

2163
02:35:12,233 --> 02:35:15,112
You already lost one kid today.
You really wanna lose another?

2164
02:35:15,949 --> 02:35:17,188
Do not test me!

2165
02:35:18,945 --> 02:35:20,305
Just kill him, Dad!

2166
02:35:23,021 --> 02:35:23,979
Weapons down.

2167
02:35:24,059 --> 02:35:24,741
Don't.

2168
02:35:24,819 --> 02:35:25,460
Don't do it.

2169
02:35:25,540 --> 02:35:26,297
Down!

2170
02:35:28,616 --> 02:35:29,575
Kick 'em away.

2171
02:35:31,693 --> 02:35:32,372
Do it!

2172
02:35:35,368 --> 02:35:36,368
No.

2173
02:35:38,125 --> 02:35:39,083
Cuff yourself.

2174
02:35:39,202 --> 02:35:40,643
No! No, don't hurt her, okay?

2175
02:35:40,802 --> 02:35:41,762
Stand there!

2176
02:35:42,561 --> 02:35:43,998
-Don't!
-Don't move!

2177
02:35:44,079 --> 02:35:44,917
Not a step.

2178
02:35:45,755 --> 02:35:47,395
Cuffs on. Now.

2179
02:35:47,595 --> 02:35:49,553
You son of a bitch.

2180
02:35:49,672 --> 02:35:51,112
Please, don't hurt her.

2181
02:35:54,188 --> 02:35:55,385
Release.

2182
02:35:56,266 --> 02:35:57,226
Or I cut.

2183
02:35:59,740 --> 02:36:01,779
What, you think I
care about some kid?

2184
02:36:03,017 --> 02:36:03,974
He's not mine.

2185
02:36:04,814 --> 02:36:06,534
We're not even the same species.

2186
02:36:07,212 --> 02:36:08,730
Just please don't...

2187
02:36:08,810 --> 02:36:09,571
don't hurt her.

2188
02:36:09,729 --> 02:36:11,088
Just please let her go.

2189
02:36:11,327 --> 02:36:12,208
-Don't.
-Please!

2190
02:36:12,288 --> 02:36:13,047
Don't kill him.

2191
02:36:13,128 --> 02:36:13,966
Listen to me!

2192
02:36:14,046 --> 02:36:15,445
Let her go. Don't hurt her.

2193
02:36:15,603 --> 02:36:17,043
Mom, don't kill him.

2194
02:36:17,762 --> 02:36:19,958
A son for a son.

2195
02:36:22,075 --> 02:36:23,234
Please don't hurt her.

2196
02:36:25,510 --> 02:36:26,709
I cut.

2197
02:36:26,829 --> 02:36:27,989
Please just let her go...

2198
02:36:28,069 --> 02:36:28,709
okay?

2199
02:36:28,788 --> 02:36:29,508
Just let her go.

2200
02:36:31,626 --> 02:36:32,425
No!

2201
02:36:41,334 --> 02:36:43,453
Kiri... Kiri.

2202
02:36:50,003 --> 02:36:50,963
Spider.

2203
02:36:51,803 --> 02:36:52,443
Spider...

2204
02:36:52,523 --> 02:36:53,602
get 'em out of here.

2205
02:36:53,962 --> 02:36:54,641
Come on.

2206
02:36:55,041 --> 02:36:55,878
Guys. Tuk.

2207
02:36:55,998 --> 02:36:57,756
I owe you a death.

2208
02:36:59,274 --> 02:36:59,915
Mom.

2209
02:36:59,995 --> 02:37:00,833
-Mama.
-Come.

2210
02:37:00,992 --> 02:37:01,911
Come on.

2211
02:37:02,030 --> 02:37:02,749
Please...

2212
02:37:02,870 --> 02:37:03,508
Mama.

2213
02:37:03,988 --> 02:37:05,427
You're not leaving, are you, Jake?

2214
02:37:06,187 --> 02:37:07,144
Knowin' I'm out there.

2215
02:37:08,343 --> 02:37:10,343
Knowin' that I'll never stop.

2216
02:37:10,742 --> 02:37:11,941
I'm coming for you.

2217
02:37:12,099 --> 02:37:14,738
And when I do,
I'll kill your whole family.

2218
02:37:15,737 --> 02:37:16,616
Dad...

2219
02:37:18,733 --> 02:37:19,612
Then let's get it done.

2220
02:37:29,881 --> 02:37:30,839
Jake!

2221
02:37:34,954 --> 02:37:35,995
-It's coming!
-Back. Back.

2222
02:37:36,115 --> 02:37:37,312
Get back to the ship. Go!

2223
02:37:37,473 --> 02:37:38,430
Tuk, swim, swim.

2224
02:37:41,509 --> 02:37:42,428
Stay close.

2225
02:37:42,667 --> 02:37:43,624
-Keep moving.
-Stay close.

2226
02:37:46,063 --> 02:37:46,702
Tuk!

2227
02:37:47,941 --> 02:37:48,777
Mom, take my hand!

2228
02:37:48,898 --> 02:37:49,578
Hold on!

2229
02:37:52,733 --> 02:37:53,813
Mom!

2230
02:37:55,412 --> 02:37:56,251
-Kiri, come on.
-No...

2231
02:37:56,412 --> 02:37:57,210
Kiri, we've got to go,
come on.

2232
02:37:57,289 --> 02:37:57,931
No!

2233
02:38:01,047 --> 02:38:02,524
Go! Climb.
Climb!

2234
02:38:02,923 --> 02:38:03,881
Kiri, come on!

2235
02:38:04,959 --> 02:38:05,959
Come on, let's go!

2236
02:38:06,719 --> 02:38:07,358
Mom!

2237
02:38:07,438 --> 02:38:08,078
Swim! Swim.

2238
02:38:08,516 --> 02:38:09,156
Go, Tuk.

2239
02:38:09,234 --> 02:38:09,875
Climb up.

2240
02:38:17,229 --> 02:38:17,868
Mom...

2241
02:38:18,946 --> 02:38:19,904
Go!

2242
02:38:20,424 --> 02:38:21,383
Go, go, go!

2243
02:38:28,573 --> 02:38:29,653
Keep climbing!
Go!

2244
02:38:34,008 --> 02:38:34,968
I got you.

2245
02:38:37,086 --> 02:38:38,045
Give me your hand!

2246
02:38:38,126 --> 02:38:38,765
Come on!

2247
02:38:41,320 --> 02:38:42,039
Open it!

2248
02:38:50,030 --> 02:38:50,749
Open it!

2249
02:38:50,830 --> 02:38:52,347
Move back.

2250
02:38:52,945 --> 02:38:53,905
Come.

2251
02:38:55,383 --> 02:38:56,024
Tuk!

2252
02:39:05,734 --> 02:39:06,611
Climb!

2253
02:39:06,891 --> 02:39:07,810
Go!

2254
02:39:09,888 --> 02:39:10,648
Climb!

2255
02:39:10,887 --> 02:39:11,607
Go!

2256
02:39:12,405 --> 02:39:13,166
Go up!

2257
02:39:18,678 --> 02:39:19,638
We're rolling over!

2258
02:39:19,959 --> 02:39:20,597
Go, go, go, go!

2259
02:39:20,678 --> 02:39:21,477
Okay...

2260
02:39:23,833 --> 02:39:24,914
No!

2261
02:39:25,392 --> 02:39:26,432
Mom!

2262
02:39:34,220 --> 02:39:35,179
Kiri!

2263
02:39:35,300 --> 02:39:35,938
Keep going!

2264
02:39:39,576 --> 02:39:40,535
This way, this way!

2265
02:39:40,935 --> 02:39:41,614
Okay.

2266
02:39:41,732 --> 02:39:42,413
Go!

2267
02:39:46,368 --> 02:39:48,286
Open it!
Open it!

2268
02:39:50,163 --> 02:39:51,201
Mom!

2269
02:39:54,118 --> 02:39:55,077
Come on!

2270
02:40:04,188 --> 02:40:05,147
Go, Tuk!

2271
02:40:07,184 --> 02:40:08,144
There's no way out!

2272
02:40:10,340 --> 02:40:11,380
Stay together, okay?

2273
02:40:11,498 --> 02:40:12,779
-Yes.
-Stay together.

2274
02:40:12,979 --> 02:40:13,937
Yes.

2275
02:40:41,666 --> 02:40:42,825
Oh, Great Mother!

2276
02:40:42,944 --> 02:40:44,264
Oh, Great Mother, help us!

2277
02:41:25,297 --> 02:41:26,255
Kiri!

2278
02:41:45,994 --> 02:41:46,634
Bro!

2279
02:41:47,473 --> 02:41:48,352
Mom and Dad...

2280
02:41:48,432 --> 02:41:49,191
are down there.

2281
02:41:49,270 --> 02:41:49,911
In the ship.

2282
02:41:50,069 --> 02:41:51,068
Grab on.

2283
02:41:51,788 --> 02:41:52,748
Bro, I'm good. Go!

2284
02:42:19,316 --> 02:42:20,275
Okay.

2285
02:42:46,926 --> 02:42:47,885
Jake!

2286
02:43:23,125 --> 02:43:23,765
Dad.

2287
02:43:28,679 --> 02:43:29,639
Fuck!

2288
02:43:43,742 --> 02:43:45,420
Come on, you son of a bitch!

2289
02:43:45,620 --> 02:43:46,501
Dad, just breathe.

2290
02:43:46,740 --> 02:43:47,499
Neteyam?

2291
02:43:48,298 --> 02:43:49,257
No, Dad.
It's Lo'ak.

2292
02:43:50,616 --> 02:43:51,574
Oh, Lo'ak.

2293
02:43:52,853 --> 02:43:53,813
I'm sorry, sir.

2294
02:43:54,250 --> 02:43:55,888
I'm sorry about Neteyam.
It's all my fault.

2295
02:43:56,088 --> 02:43:57,048
Just focus.

2296
02:43:57,168 --> 02:43:58,247
Focus on now.

2297
02:44:16,664 --> 02:44:17,785
We're losing the air pocket.

2298
02:44:17,905 --> 02:44:18,864
Come on.
We've gotta move.

2299
02:44:19,024 --> 02:44:20,063
Come on, Dad.

2300
02:44:27,453 --> 02:44:28,973
You know your way out?

2301
02:44:29,332 --> 02:44:31,969
I think so. But, Dad,
it's gonna be a long breath-hold.

2302
02:44:32,129 --> 02:44:33,529
I can't make it.

2303
02:44:34,128 --> 02:44:35,367
You can. You can.

2304
02:44:35,486 --> 02:44:36,124
No.

2305
02:44:36,245 --> 02:44:37,245
So you gotta go right now.

2306
02:44:37,763 --> 02:44:39,202
I can't lose you too, Dad.

2307
02:44:39,323 --> 02:44:40,002
Please.

2308
02:44:44,315 --> 02:44:45,834
Mama, I'm scared.

2309
02:44:47,270 --> 02:44:48,228
It is all right.

2310
02:44:49,069 --> 02:44:50,068
Stay close to me.

2311
02:44:50,987 --> 02:44:51,986
Stay close to Mama.

2312
02:44:54,384 --> 02:44:55,342
It's okay.

2313
02:45:11,365 --> 02:45:13,162
You just have to
slow your heart down.

2314
02:45:13,522 --> 02:45:14,640
Be real calm.

2315
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:17,200
Breathe from here.

2316
02:45:17,319 --> 02:45:18,877
Hey, breathe from here.

2317
02:45:31,823 --> 02:45:33,101
The way of water has no...

2318
02:45:33,220 --> 02:45:34,460
beginning and no end.

2319
02:45:37,096 --> 02:45:39,053
The sea is around
you and in you.

2320
02:45:40,531 --> 02:45:41,731
The sea is your home...

2321
02:45:41,890 --> 02:45:44,127
before your birth
and after your death.

2322
02:45:49,082 --> 02:45:51,880
The sea gives
and the sea takes.

2323
02:45:53,038 --> 02:45:54,995
Water connects all things.

2324
02:45:57,074 --> 02:45:58,553
Life to death.

2325
02:46:00,310 --> 02:46:02,467
Darkness to light.

2326
02:46:24,804 --> 02:46:25,563
-Hi.
-Kiri!

2327
02:46:25,760 --> 02:46:26,679
Kiri.

2328
02:46:26,879 --> 02:46:28,799
Everything's going to
be all right, little sister.

2329
02:46:29,118 --> 02:46:29,917
Mom...

2330
02:46:30,038 --> 02:46:31,274
I'm gonna give this to you.

2331
02:46:36,110 --> 02:46:36,988
It'll help you.

2332
02:46:38,506 --> 02:46:39,427
Dad, you can do this.

2333
02:46:41,145 --> 02:46:42,343
Trust me.

2334
02:46:42,943 --> 02:46:43,862
Calm your heart.

2335
02:46:46,139 --> 02:46:47,097
Big breaths.

2336
02:46:50,973 --> 02:46:51,931
Last breath.

2337
02:46:56,768 --> 02:46:57,726
Follow me.

2338
02:48:10,844 --> 02:48:12,004
Hold on.

2339
02:48:12,082 --> 02:48:13,001
Just breathe.

2340
02:48:13,681 --> 02:48:14,441
Just breathe.

2341
02:48:18,836 --> 02:48:19,794
Thank you.

2342
02:48:28,384 --> 02:48:29,903
I See you...

2343
02:48:30,024 --> 02:48:30,822
son.

2344
02:48:33,297 --> 02:48:34,098
MaJake!

2345
02:48:35,537 --> 02:48:36,615
-Dad!
-Mom!

2346
02:48:36,774 --> 02:48:37,893
Dad. Dad.

2347
02:48:39,331 --> 02:48:39,973
Come on.

2348
02:48:42,409 --> 02:48:43,529
Here.

2349
02:48:49,602 --> 02:48:50,560
Brother.

2350
02:48:59,629 --> 02:49:01,468
Sullys stick together.

2351
02:49:03,666 --> 02:49:05,144
It was our greatest weakness...

2352
02:49:06,504 --> 02:49:07,860
and our great strength.

2353
02:49:09,778 --> 02:49:11,458
Thank you, Great Mother.

2354
02:49:12,136 --> 02:49:13,094
Thank you.

2355
02:49:50,774 --> 02:49:51,733
Let's move out.

2356
02:49:58,085 --> 02:49:59,044
Son.

2357
02:50:01,161 --> 02:50:02,118
Come with me.

2358
02:50:06,754 --> 02:50:07,713
Spider!

2359
02:50:40,557 --> 02:50:41,477
Monkey Boy!

2360
02:50:45,912 --> 02:50:47,070
Spider.

2361
02:50:54,061 --> 02:50:55,180
-You all right?
-Yeah.

2362
02:50:59,255 --> 02:51:00,214
Come here.

2363
02:51:03,090 --> 02:51:05,169
A son for a son.

2364
02:51:21,232 --> 02:51:23,429
Every songcord must have a last bead.

2365
02:51:47,561 --> 02:51:49,320
A father protects.

2366
02:51:50,558 --> 02:51:51,996
It's what gives him meaning.

2367
02:52:19,168 --> 02:52:21,524
The People say that
all energy is only borrowed.

2368
02:52:24,242 --> 02:52:26,000
And one day you
have to give it back.

2369
02:52:39,345 --> 02:52:40,903
Eywa holds...

2370
02:52:41,103 --> 02:52:42,461
all her children in her heart.

2371
02:52:44,337 --> 02:52:45,577
Nothing is ever lost.

2372
02:52:48,773 --> 02:52:49,733
Neteyam!

2373
02:52:50,331 --> 02:52:51,531
Neteyam!

2374
02:53:10,711 --> 02:53:11,908
My family and I...

2375
02:53:12,947 --> 02:53:13,947
we'll move on tomorrow.

2376
02:53:14,704 --> 02:53:15,784
Far away from here.

2377
02:53:17,103 --> 02:53:18,741
Your son lies with our ancestors.

2378
02:53:19,979 --> 02:53:22,578
You are Metkayina now.

2379
02:53:28,050 --> 02:53:29,406
And there it was.

2380
02:53:31,325 --> 02:53:32,685
We are Sea People now.

2381
02:53:35,081 --> 02:53:36,920
This is our home.

2382
02:54:34,975 --> 02:54:35,935
Dad!

2383
02:54:36,734 --> 02:54:37,692
Look what I caught!

2384
02:54:38,491 --> 02:54:39,449
Wow.

2385
02:54:40,688 --> 02:54:41,689
Oh, that's a big one.

2386
02:54:42,327 --> 02:54:43,924
He was in that pool.

2387
02:54:44,084 --> 02:54:44,725
By the rocks.

2388
02:54:46,762 --> 02:54:47,921
Right where you said.

2389
02:54:51,677 --> 02:54:52,714
What is it, Dad?

2390
02:54:54,273 --> 02:54:55,234
Why are you crying?

2391
02:54:57,431 --> 02:54:59,869
I'm just happy to see you, boy.

2392
02:55:01,427 --> 02:55:02,664
I'm happy to see you, too.

2393
02:55:05,300 --> 02:55:05,942
Here.

2394
02:55:06,100 --> 02:55:06,781
You try.

2395
02:55:09,176 --> 02:55:10,136
Okay.

2396
02:55:11,815 --> 02:55:13,092
Leave any for me?

2397
02:55:13,253 --> 02:55:14,209
Maybe.

2398
02:55:20,565 --> 02:55:22,323
Yeah! Check that out. See?

2399
02:55:29,592 --> 02:55:30,831
I see now.

2400
02:55:31,751 --> 02:55:33,670
I can't save my family by running.

2401
02:55:34,787 --> 02:55:35,787
This is our home.

2402
02:55:36,746 --> 02:55:38,304
This is our fortress.

2403
02:55:39,583 --> 02:55:41,581
This is where we make our stand.
