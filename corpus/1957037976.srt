I was practising this one thing yesterday

22, forget about that. Listen.

1051
00:48:39,837 --> 00:48:41,839
I need to know this, Joe.
Why didn't she quit?

1052
00:48:42,005 --> 00:48:43,090
Because she loves to play.

Then my daughter got sick,

1204

(CHUCKLES) and barber school
is a lot cheaper

1205

than veterinarian school.
