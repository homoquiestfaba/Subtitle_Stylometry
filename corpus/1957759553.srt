00:00:00,634 --> 00:00:03,634
[instrumental music]

2
00:00:30,097 --> 00:00:32,647
[music continues]

3
00:00:46,247 --> 00:00:50,018
(male #1)
Merry Christmas!

4
00:00:50,018 --> 00:00:53,620
Heh-he! Remember the needy
of Bedrock this Christmas.

5
00:00:53,687 --> 00:00:55,289
[indistinct chattering]

6
00:00:55,356 --> 00:01:00,156
Thank you, heh, Merry Christmas.

7
00:01:01,095 --> 00:01:02,263
Hey, Santa.

8
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:03,598
If you need a pit stop

9
00:01:03,665 --> 00:01:05,966
during your midnight ride
for the kiddies

10
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:08,703
drop in at the Bedrock
community theater.

11
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:10,804
Yeah, we're doing
a Christmas carol.

12
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:12,741
Seven o'clock, don't be late.

13
00:01:12,807 --> 00:01:16,010
Don't you recognize me, Bert?
I'm in it.

14
00:01:16,077 --> 00:01:19,414
[laughs]

15
00:01:19,414 --> 00:01:20,548
[indistinct chattering]

16
00:01:20,615 --> 00:01:22,716
All I've got left
are balcony seats.

17
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:25,520
I'll take 'em.

18
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,520
All sales are final, no refunds,
exchanges or bad reviews.

19
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:33,294
Christmas..

20
00:01:33,361 --> 00:01:34,561
...bah, humbug.

21
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:36,731
[laughs]

22
00:01:36,798 --> 00:01:39,667
Oh, you're gonna knock
'em dead tonight, Freddie boy.

23
00:01:39,734 --> 00:01:42,403
Wilma, am I a great Scrooge
or what?

24
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:46,207
Huh, you're a great Scrooge,
Fred, but you're no help.

25
00:01:46,274 --> 00:01:48,910
Oh, come on, Wilma,
help me rehearse.

26
00:01:48,977 --> 00:01:50,878
Don't forget,
you are the stage manager

27
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:53,381
for the Bedrock
Community players.

28
00:01:53,448 --> 00:01:57,986
- And I, I am the leading actor.
- No time, Fred.

29
00:01:58,053 --> 00:02:00,922
'Our costume designer
came down with that awful flu'

30
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:04,926
the Bedrock Bug, so now
I'm doing wardrobe too.

31
00:02:04,993 --> 00:02:09,230
- In case you haven't noticed.
- Hey, you're doing costumes?

32
00:02:09,297 --> 00:02:11,598
Great, I just pulled a thread.

33
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:13,367
[clears throat]

34
00:02:13,434 --> 00:02:15,770
"Christmas, a poor excuse

35
00:02:15,837 --> 00:02:19,440
for picking a businessman's
pocket every 25th of December."

36
00:02:19,507 --> 00:02:22,310
Fred, you are really
unbelievable.

37
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:26,247
- Yeah, unbelievable.
- Unbelievable?

38
00:02:26,314 --> 00:02:28,682
As scrooge? Me?

39
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:29,783
Unthinkable.

40
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,552
Well, Mr. Scrooge

41
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:34,555
it sounds like your daughter
needs her diaper changed.

42
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:37,992
Uh, sorry, Wilma,
I gotta practice my lines.

43
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:41,362
"Christmas? Bah, humbug." Uh..

44
00:02:41,429 --> 00:02:45,066
"Christmas, baah, humbug."

45
00:02:45,133 --> 00:02:50,133
There's such a thing
as being too well rehearsed.

46
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:55,176
[barking]

47
00:02:55,176 --> 00:02:57,612
chomp

48
00:02:57,612 --> 00:03:00,247
Hey, everybody's
gotta make a livin'.

49
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:04,452
There you go, Pebbles,
all better.

50
00:03:04,452 --> 00:03:06,620
(Fred)
'Christmas, bah, humbug!'

51
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,523
Aww.

52
00:03:08,589 --> 00:03:11,125
Pebbles, don't be so hard
on daddy.

53
00:03:11,192 --> 00:03:13,894
He's trying, very trying.

54
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:15,763
"What's Christmas time to you

55
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:18,232
but a time for paying bills
without money?"

56
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:19,767
[Dino barking]
Huh?

57
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,068
Oh, no!

58
00:03:21,135 --> 00:03:23,137
Dino!

59
00:03:23,204 --> 00:03:26,507
[barking]

60
00:03:26,507 --> 00:03:29,576
Will you stop it!
Now look what you've done.

61
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:33,282
[whimpering]

62
00:03:33,282 --> 00:03:36,284
You better hope Wilma can clean
my costume before show time.

63
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,719
Huh, time?

64
00:03:37,786 --> 00:03:42,724
Oh, nice going, Dino,
now I'm late for work.

65
00:03:42,724 --> 00:03:46,324
Christmas, bah, hum-bug.

66
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:53,667
Fred, aren't you forgetting
a little something?

67
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:55,636
You're right!

68
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,472
My lunch.

69
00:03:57,538 --> 00:03:59,274
Wrong, your daughter.

70
00:03:59,341 --> 00:04:01,476
You're supposed to drop her off
at the Cave Care Center.

71
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:03,210
Remember?

72
00:04:03,277 --> 00:04:04,512
Uh, right, Cave Care.

73
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:06,414
And, Fred, don't forget

74
00:04:06,481 --> 00:04:08,516
you have to pick Pebbles
up at four

75
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:11,319
because I'm going
to the theater early.

76
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:14,955
(Fred)
'Christmas, bah, hum-m-bug.'

77
00:04:15,022 --> 00:04:17,925
(Wilma)
'Did you hear me?'

78
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:20,175
What a scrooge.

79
00:04:25,533 --> 00:04:27,534
[laughing]

80
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:28,603
Pebbles.

81
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:29,903
We're running a little late
this morning

82
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,572
Miss Feldspar, here you go.

83
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:33,608
Mr. Flintstone,
aren't you nervous

84
00:04:33,675 --> 00:04:35,443
about your performance tonight?

85
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,578
I know I am.

86
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:39,213
Are you kidding?

87
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,350
I've been rehearsing
night and day.

88
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:44,519
This part is all I've thought
about for the last two months.

89
00:04:44,585 --> 00:04:48,189
- Kiss, da-da, hug, da-da.
- Bah!

90
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:52,827
So I see.

91
00:04:52,827 --> 00:04:56,698
[crying]
Bye-bye, da-da.

92
00:04:56,698 --> 00:05:00,668
- Pebbles.
- Bamm-Bamm.

93
00:05:00,668 --> 00:05:02,003
What about you, Bamm-Bamm?

94
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:05,573
Are you ready
for your part tonight?

95
00:05:05,573 --> 00:05:09,323
"God bless us, everyone."

96
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:16,651
Hm, "Please, spirit."

97
00:05:16,718 --> 00:05:19,220
- 'Tonight's gonna be a blast.'
- "Show me no more.

98
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:23,424
Spirit, I'm not the man I was."

99
00:05:23,424 --> 00:05:26,527
thud

100
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:27,795
Hey!

101
00:05:27,862 --> 00:05:30,031
Watch where you're going,
Flintstone.

102
00:05:30,098 --> 00:05:32,900
"I will not be the man
I would have been."

103
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:35,503
Uh, hiya, Fred. Ooh!

104
00:05:35,503 --> 00:05:39,007
"Take pity, good spirit."

105
00:05:39,007 --> 00:05:43,010
Well, well, if it isn't
Ebonezer Scrooge himself.

106
00:05:43,077 --> 00:05:45,713
Greetings, supporting players.

107
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,382
Hey, we're in this play
too, Flintstone.

108
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:51,151
Yeah, but there can
only be one Scrooge.

109
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:52,987
[laughs]

110
00:05:53,054 --> 00:05:55,123
Well, I guess
they got the right guy.

111
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,892
Uh, gee, Fred, I thought
you were never gonna get here.

112
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:59,594
Barney, I was rehearsing.

113
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,862
You don't get to be great
without rehearsing.

114
00:06:01,929 --> 00:06:05,199
Yoo-hoo, Mr. Flintstone.

115
00:06:05,266 --> 00:06:08,536
Wanna rehearse
our big love scene?

116
00:06:08,603 --> 00:06:10,238
Happy to oblige, Maggie.

117
00:06:10,305 --> 00:06:13,507
A great actor
is always ready to rehearse.

118
00:06:13,574 --> 00:06:17,511
Ooh, Ebonezer, I love you.

119
00:06:17,578 --> 00:06:21,028
And...and...I love you.

120
00:06:24,619 --> 00:06:26,020
- Huh?
- Ooh!

121
00:06:26,087 --> 00:06:30,791
Flintstone, you're not the only
one on the play tonight.

122
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:32,526
Ooh!

123
00:06:32,593 --> 00:06:35,429
No, Mr. Slate,
but Iam the star.

124
00:06:35,496 --> 00:06:36,965
Is that so?

125
00:06:37,032 --> 00:06:40,168
Well, I thinkI would have made
a better Scrooge.

126
00:06:40,235 --> 00:06:42,769
Yeah, you're certainly
cheap enough, Mr. Slate.

127
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:45,306
[laughs]

128
00:06:45,373 --> 00:06:48,943
That's enough,
Rubble, Flintstone.

129
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:54,010
Okay, okay,
we're going, we're going.

130
00:06:55,483 --> 00:06:56,851
One minute.

131
00:06:56,918 --> 00:06:58,887
So there won't be any excuses

132
00:06:58,953 --> 00:07:01,122
for getting to the play late

133
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:04,124
everybody gets
to leave after lunch.

134
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:06,627
Is that time off with pay?

135
00:07:06,694 --> 00:07:08,929
Well..

136
00:07:08,996 --> 00:07:11,432
I suppose so.

137
00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:13,968
Merry Christmas.

138
00:07:14,035 --> 00:07:17,304
- Merry Christmas, boss.
- Merry Christmas!

139
00:07:17,371 --> 00:07:20,874
[groaning]
See, I'm no scrooge.

140
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,291
No, I am.

141
00:07:26,014 --> 00:07:28,815
Well, at least this doesn't
have to be a waste of time.

142
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:30,018
We can rehearse.

143
00:07:30,085 --> 00:07:32,687
Uh, yeah, sure, Fred,
whatever you say.

144
00:07:32,754 --> 00:07:36,258
"It feels awfully warm
in here, Cragit.

145
00:07:36,324 --> 00:07:38,359
'Have you been using
all my coal again?"'

146
00:07:38,426 --> 00:07:41,029
'Barn? Barney?'

147
00:07:41,096 --> 00:07:45,200
I said, "Have you been using
all my coal again?"

148
00:07:45,267 --> 00:07:49,370
Uh, and I thought we chewed
scenery for a living.

149
00:07:49,437 --> 00:07:51,873
Barney, you missed your cue.

150
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,708
Oh, gee, uh, sorry, Fred.

151
00:07:53,775 --> 00:07:55,509
'Is that what's gonna
happen tonight?'

152
00:07:55,576 --> 00:07:58,346
- 'Come on, pay attention.'
- Hey!

153
00:07:58,413 --> 00:08:02,082
Gee, Fred, uh, maybe it wouldn't
hurt if you pay attention too.

154
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,584
- To what?
- To work.

155
00:08:03,651 --> 00:08:06,186
Oh, come on, Barn,
this is show biz.

156
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:08,490
We have a shot at the big time.

157
00:08:08,557 --> 00:08:11,993
It's just one night of community
theater, Fred, not Broadrock.

158
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,994
Let's just get
this scene right, okay?

159
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:15,062
- Okay.
- Okay.

160
00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:16,830
- Okay.
- Okay!

161
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:17,932
Now then..

162
00:08:17,999 --> 00:08:19,033
'"Have you been using all--"'

163
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:23,071
Oh, huh,
I think I'm going to be sick.

164
00:08:23,138 --> 00:08:26,407
No, I take that back, I am sick.

165
00:08:26,474 --> 00:08:27,642
[groans]

166
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:28,843
thud

167
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:32,680
Oh, boy, everybody's a critic.

168
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,617
[chuckling]

169
00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:39,453
Gee, that wasn't a reflection
on your performance, Fred.

170
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,489
Your bronto
got the Bedrock Bug.

171
00:08:41,555 --> 00:08:43,724
And it's quitting time.

172
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:47,162
That's what he thinks.

173
00:08:47,162 --> 00:08:49,964
Listen, Barn, I still think
your acting needs work.

174
00:08:50,031 --> 00:08:51,899
If you're not
well rehearsed, buddy

175
00:08:51,966 --> 00:08:53,534
you could make me look bad.

176
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:55,703
Hey. I know my lines, Fred.

177
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:59,273
Yeah, but there's more to acting
than just memorization.

178
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,742
Iam Scrooge.

179
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:03,377
Well, I'm sorry, Fred

180
00:09:03,444 --> 00:09:05,813
but there's more
to life than acting.

181
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,148
Not to an actor.

182
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:09,551
Uh, maybe not

183
00:09:09,618 --> 00:09:11,953
but in case you've forgotten,
tomorrow's Christmas.

184
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,521
I've gotta go home
and wrap presents.

185
00:09:13,587 --> 00:09:15,690
[stammers]
P-presents?

186
00:09:15,756 --> 00:09:17,359
[laughs]

187
00:09:17,425 --> 00:09:20,161
Why, of course,
o-of course I didn't forget.

188
00:09:20,228 --> 00:09:22,730
What do you think I am?
Some kind of scrooge?

189
00:09:22,797 --> 00:09:25,400
Oh, boy, nice going, Flintstone.

190
00:09:25,467 --> 00:09:29,102
You have nothing to put under
the tree for Wilma or Pebbles.

191
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:32,769
Lucky I still have time.

192
00:09:34,341 --> 00:09:35,942
vroom

193
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:38,213
Merry Christmas!

194
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:40,648
[chuckles]
Remember the needy of Bedrock

195
00:09:40,715 --> 00:09:42,282
this Christmas.

196
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:44,518
Christmas, bah, humbug.

197
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:48,288
- Ugh, what a scrooge.
- Yeah, good, aren't I?

198
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:49,857
I'm playing Scrooge tonight

199
00:09:49,924 --> 00:09:52,359
at the Bedrock
Community Theater.

200
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:55,295
I know, now,
what about the needy?

201
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:57,164
Hey, I got presents to buy.

202
00:09:57,231 --> 00:09:59,234
Look at these prices!

203
00:09:59,301 --> 00:10:01,535
How am I gonna find
something for Wilma

204
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:04,806
in this madhouse?

205
00:10:04,806 --> 00:10:08,209
(boy #1)
'Wow, I've gotta have that.'

206
00:10:08,276 --> 00:10:10,611
(Fred)
'Now there's a dress,
Wilma's gonna love it.'

207
00:10:10,678 --> 00:10:12,780
- It's an Yves saint Laurock.
- It's on sale.

208
00:10:12,847 --> 00:10:15,150
- Oh, no!
- It's my size.

209
00:10:15,216 --> 00:10:18,218
(male #2)
'I can't imagine
anyone liking it.'

210
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:20,588
Any more of those dresses?

211
00:10:20,655 --> 00:10:23,057
Oh, sorry, all sold out.

212
00:10:23,124 --> 00:10:26,328
- You should've shopped earlier.
- I'll take this one.

213
00:10:26,394 --> 00:10:28,496
The necklace doesn't come
with it, you know.

214
00:10:28,562 --> 00:10:29,697
I'll take that too.

215
00:10:29,764 --> 00:10:31,833
It's not real sabretooth, is it?

216
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:35,069
Of course not,
they're an endangered species.

217
00:10:35,136 --> 00:10:36,604
'Now, how are you
gonna pay for this?'

218
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:39,341

Mesozoic Express.

219
00:10:39,407 --> 00:10:41,075

'I'm sure your daughter
will love'

220
00:10:41,142 --> 00:10:43,177
this stuffed pigasaurus,
Mr. Flintstone.

221
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:45,213
Yeah, a Jurassic pork.

222
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,914
What'll they think up next?

223
00:10:46,981 --> 00:10:49,184
Thank you for shopping
Bloomingshales.

224
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,652
Uh, gift wrapping is over there,
Mr. Flintstone.

225
00:10:51,719 --> 00:10:53,086
[laughs]

226
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,789
Huh?

227
00:10:54,856 --> 00:10:57,526
'Oh, boy!'

228
00:10:57,592 --> 00:11:01,428
Uh-uh, no way I'm standing
in some long line.

229
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:03,465
(male #4)
'Hey, man.'

230
00:11:03,532 --> 00:11:06,734
- Hey, watch where you're going.
- What a jerk.

231
00:11:06,801 --> 00:11:08,803
- Wrap these.
- What's your number?

232
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,805
Number? Huh?

233
00:11:10,872 --> 00:11:14,908
(male #5)
'You gotta have a number.'

234
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:15,943
Oh!

235
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:18,546
Eighty-six.

236
00:11:18,612 --> 00:11:21,081
Thanks, buddy,
say, what's your number?

237
00:11:21,148 --> 00:11:22,850
Three.

238
00:11:22,917 --> 00:11:25,653
Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, I could
be standing here for hours.

239
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,489
[clock chiming]

240
00:11:28,489 --> 00:11:30,458
[squawks]

241
00:11:30,525 --> 00:11:32,593
Four o'clock
and time for all good boys

242
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,628
to have their Christmas
shopping done.

243
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:37,432
Oh, well,
it's only four o'clock.. Huh!

244
00:11:37,499 --> 00:11:42,499
Four o'clock! I've got to get
to the the theater!

245
00:11:42,803 --> 00:11:46,374
- Hey, what's your number, kid?
- 427.

246
00:11:46,441 --> 00:11:48,309
I'll make you a deal,
take my number 86.

247
00:11:48,376 --> 00:11:52,045
Get these wrapped for me
and wait here till I get back.

248
00:11:52,112 --> 00:11:54,815
Uh, right.

249
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:56,317
[instrumental music]

250
00:11:56,384 --> 00:11:58,552
Gotta get to the theater
before curtain time

251
00:11:58,619 --> 00:12:00,187
or Wilma will kill me.

252
00:12:00,254 --> 00:12:02,423
Christmas, humbug.

253
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:03,839
[beeping]

254
00:12:07,762 --> 00:12:09,130
ting

255
00:12:09,197 --> 00:12:11,766
What a world of fools I live in.

256
00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:12,582

257
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:23,778
[siren blaring]

258
00:12:23,844 --> 00:12:26,246
Alright, pull over.

259
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:28,283
screech

260
00:12:28,349 --> 00:12:30,952
Fred, it's me, Philo Quartz.

261
00:12:31,018 --> 00:12:33,153
Didn't you see that
red light back there?

262
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,355
Philo, I'm a star.

263
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:36,857
I was rehearsing.

264
00:12:36,924 --> 00:12:38,893
I'll let you off
this time, Fred

265
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,229
but you better get the stars
out of your eyes

266
00:12:41,296 --> 00:12:45,646
and watch where you're going.

267
00:12:47,469 --> 00:12:50,338
I know where I'm going,
straight to Broadrock.

268
00:12:50,405 --> 00:12:55,405
But first, I think
I'll stop off for a snack.

269
00:12:57,044 --> 00:12:58,011
[shouting]

270
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:02,683

271
00:13:02,683 --> 00:13:04,418
[groaning]

272
00:13:04,485 --> 00:13:07,355
Ow!

273
00:13:07,355 --> 00:13:09,723
(Wilma) Fred, went to the theatre with Betty.

274
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,959
See you and Pebbles there later.

275
00:13:12,026 --> 00:13:15,629
[laughs]

276
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:17,798
Nothing like a little snack.
Burp!

277
00:13:17,865 --> 00:13:19,366
Curtain up.

278
00:13:19,433 --> 00:13:21,533
'Bah, humbug!'

279
00:13:25,206 --> 00:13:28,206
[instrumental music]

280
00:13:31,413 --> 00:13:36,413
(female #1)
'Sit still, I told you..'

281
00:13:39,387 --> 00:13:41,522
Well, it's about time, Fred.

282
00:13:41,589 --> 00:13:43,591
Why are you so late?

283
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:44,658
Last-minute shop..

284
00:13:44,725 --> 00:13:46,261
Uh-uh, rehearsing.

285
00:13:46,327 --> 00:13:48,996
Uh, that's it,
last-minute rehearsing.

286
00:13:49,063 --> 00:13:50,464
Well, it sounds as if
you've got

287
00:13:50,531 --> 00:13:52,433
your Scrooge part down pat.

288
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:53,602
Well, thanks, Wilma--

289
00:13:53,668 --> 00:13:55,803
But you've got a lot more
rehearsing to do

290
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:58,005
for your role as father.

291
00:13:58,072 --> 00:14:00,108
- Huh?
- Ooh!

292
00:14:00,174 --> 00:14:03,611
Oh, Fred Flintstone,
how could you?

293
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:04,745
How could I what?

294
00:14:04,812 --> 00:14:07,681
How could you forget
your own daughter?

295
00:14:07,748 --> 00:14:12,319
- Pebbles?
- 'Yes, Pebbles.'

296
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:14,689
Uh-oh.

297
00:14:14,756 --> 00:14:18,226
Fortunately, Barney
picked her up at Cave Care

298
00:14:18,293 --> 00:14:20,194
becauseyou forgot.

299
00:14:20,261 --> 00:14:22,196
But she's fine, see?

300
00:14:22,263 --> 00:14:25,300
- She's playing with Bamm--
- Fred Flintstone!

301
00:14:25,366 --> 00:14:27,636
"God bless us, everyone."

302
00:14:27,702 --> 00:14:31,372
That's right, Bamm-Bamm,
everyone but Fred.

303
00:14:31,439 --> 00:14:34,475
- But, Wilma..
- Don't "But, Wilma" me, Fred.

304
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,478
Ever since you got this part

305
00:14:36,544 --> 00:14:39,613
all you've thought about
is yourself.

306
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,049
Ooh!

307
00:14:42,116 --> 00:14:44,885
Come on, Scrooge,
uh, I mean, Fred.

308
00:14:44,952 --> 00:14:46,988
Let's get you
into makeup and costume.

309
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:48,256
Whoa!

310
00:14:48,323 --> 00:14:51,493
Here, put this on while
I finish Mr. Slate's makeup.

311
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:55,263
I still say,
I should have played Scrooge.

312
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:58,433
You've got a very important
role, Mr. Slate.

313
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:03,437
Besides, that'd be typecasting.

314
00:15:03,437 --> 00:15:06,274
[coughing]

315
00:15:06,274 --> 00:15:11,274
Perfect, okay, pick up your
chains and you're all set.

316
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:13,245
[giggling]

317
00:15:20,288 --> 00:15:22,656
Do I look great or what?

318
00:15:22,723 --> 00:15:24,592
Makeup's not bad either, Betty.

319
00:15:24,659 --> 00:15:26,894
Of course, you had
so much to work with.

320
00:15:26,961 --> 00:15:30,531
Well, this is your big moment,
Mr. Scrooge.

321
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:33,100
You're on.

322
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,871
[stammers]
A-b-I'm-I'm-I'm on? My hat!

323
00:15:36,871 --> 00:15:38,640
My hat!

324
00:15:38,707 --> 00:15:40,542
I say, Wilma,
are we quite ready?

325
00:15:40,608 --> 00:15:43,577
I'm ready to clobber
my leading man, Mr. Brickens.

326
00:15:43,644 --> 00:15:45,846
Cue the snow.

327
00:15:45,913 --> 00:15:49,717
Let's get this show
on the road.

328
00:15:49,717 --> 00:15:51,217
[rattling]

329
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,162
Wish me luck, Wilma.

330
00:16:01,229 --> 00:16:03,463
Yeah, break a leg.

331
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,900

00:17:04,392 --> 00:17:06,628
It feels awfully warm
in here, Cragit.

355
00:17:06,695 --> 00:17:09,263
Have you been using
all my coal again?

356
00:17:09,263 --> 00:17:10,597
Hmm..

357
00:17:10,664 --> 00:17:13,600
One, two, three..

358
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:15,036
No, Mr. Scrooge.

359
00:17:15,102 --> 00:17:19,006
I-I haven't put any in
since y-yesterday.

360
00:17:19,006 --> 00:17:21,543
'And you'll need none tomorrow.'

361
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:24,378
It's a holiday,
so I'll save on coal.

362
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:27,014
Hey.

363
00:17:27,014 --> 00:17:30,051
But I suppose
I still have to pay you.

364
00:17:30,117 --> 00:17:32,453
Gee, it's-it's only once a year.

365
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,889
And I suppose
you'll want the whole day off?

366
00:17:34,955 --> 00:17:37,124
Oh, please, sir,
it is Christmas.

367
00:17:37,191 --> 00:17:40,194
It's only fair.

368
00:17:40,194 --> 00:17:42,129
It isn't fair! Hmm.

369
00:17:42,196 --> 00:17:44,699
Christmas, humbug.

370
00:17:44,766 --> 00:17:47,601
A poor excuse for picking
a businessman's pocket

371
00:17:47,668 --> 00:17:49,937
every 25th of December.

372
00:17:50,004 --> 00:17:51,438
thud

373
00:17:51,505 --> 00:17:53,608
Hey.

374
00:17:53,675 --> 00:17:57,344
Well, be sure to be here all
the earlier the next morning.

375
00:17:57,344 --> 00:18:00,047
thud

376
00:18:00,047 --> 00:18:04,152
[sighs]
Yes, sir, Mr. Scrooge.

377
00:18:04,152 --> 00:18:06,922
(Scrooge)
'Why should the world
take a day off?'

378
00:18:06,988 --> 00:18:11,988
I could be collecting more debts
and making more money.

379
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,310
Master Ned.

380
00:18:19,935 --> 00:18:24,935
Thank you, Bob,
but I think I'll need these.

381
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,809
- What?
- Merry Christmas, uncle.

382
00:18:27,876 --> 00:18:31,412
- Christmas? Humbug.
- Christmas a humbug, uncle?

383
00:18:31,479 --> 00:18:33,814
- Surely you don't mean that.
- I do.

384
00:18:33,881 --> 00:18:35,649
What reason have you
to be merry?

385
00:18:35,716 --> 00:18:36,885
'You're poor enough.'

386
00:18:36,952 --> 00:18:38,986
And what reason have you
to be miserable?

387
00:18:39,053 --> 00:18:40,854
- 'You're rich enough.'
- Huh!

388
00:18:40,921 --> 00:18:42,623
Bah, humbug.

389
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:44,292
thud

390
00:18:44,358 --> 00:18:47,958
Merry Christmas, indeed.

391
00:18:50,497 --> 00:18:51,465
[chuckles]

392
00:18:51,531 --> 00:18:54,602
Huh!

393
00:18:54,602 --> 00:18:58,105
Tell me, my poor nephew,
what's Christmas to you?

394
00:18:58,172 --> 00:19:00,742
Just a time for paying bills
without money.

395
00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:04,778
'A time for finding yourself
a year older.'

396
00:19:04,778 --> 00:19:06,915
And not an hour richer.

397
00:19:06,982 --> 00:19:09,216
If I had my way,
every fool who goes about

398
00:19:09,283 --> 00:19:11,352
with "Merry Christmas"
on his lips

399
00:19:11,419 --> 00:19:13,521
'should be boiled
with his own pudding'

400
00:19:13,588 --> 00:19:16,257
'and buried with a stake
of holly through his heart.'

401
00:19:16,324 --> 00:19:18,827
- Uncle.
- Nephew!

402
00:19:18,893 --> 00:19:23,264
You keep Christmas in your way
and let me keep it in mine.

403
00:19:23,331 --> 00:19:25,834
- But you don't keep it.
- And I won't.

404
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:29,737
Christmas has done me no good
and it will do you no good.

405
00:19:29,804 --> 00:19:31,739
Perhaps I haven't profited by it

406
00:19:31,806 --> 00:19:33,974
but I say that
Christmas is a kind

407
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:36,277
forgiving, charitable time.

408
00:19:36,344 --> 00:19:37,779
The only time
when men and women

409
00:19:37,846 --> 00:19:40,448
seem to open their
shut-up hearts freely.

410
00:19:40,515 --> 00:19:43,351
Though Christmas has never put
any gold or silver in my pocket

411
00:19:43,417 --> 00:19:46,587
I believe it has done me good
and will do me good

412
00:19:46,654 --> 00:19:50,525
and I say, "God bless it."

413
00:19:50,525 --> 00:19:53,661
(Scrooge)
'Cragit?
Are you trying to get fired?'

414
00:19:53,728 --> 00:19:56,263
- 'Get back to your ledgers.'
- Uh, no, sir.

415
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:59,134
I-I mean, y-yes, sir.
Uh, s-sorry, sir.

416
00:19:59,201 --> 00:20:03,571
Now, if you're quite through,
nephew, be off with you.

417
00:20:03,638 --> 00:20:05,040
But I'm not through, uncle.

418
00:20:05,107 --> 00:20:06,807
I want to invite you
to Christmas dinner

419
00:20:06,874 --> 00:20:08,142
with my wife and I.

420
00:20:08,209 --> 00:20:11,145
- No, thank you.
- Why not?

421
00:20:11,212 --> 00:20:13,381
Why did you marry
that penniless girl?

422
00:20:13,448 --> 00:20:16,617
- Because I fell in love.
- Love?

423
00:20:16,683 --> 00:20:18,486
Bah, humbug.

424
00:20:18,553 --> 00:20:21,189
Love without money
is a bad investment.

425
00:20:21,256 --> 00:20:24,292
- Good afternoon.
- Please, uncle, dine with us.

426
00:20:24,358 --> 00:20:26,093
I want nothing from you.

427
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,996
thud

428
00:20:28,063 --> 00:20:29,964
- Why can't we be friends?
- Humbug.

429
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:32,400
Who needs friends

430
00:20:32,467 --> 00:20:34,302
when I have all this?

431
00:20:34,368 --> 00:20:35,868
[laughing]

432
00:20:43,311 --> 00:20:45,680
Huh, he's a cold one,
your uncle is.

433
00:20:45,747 --> 00:20:49,216
I'm afraid so, but no reason
we shouldn't celebrate.

434
00:20:49,283 --> 00:20:52,453
Have a very
Merry Christmas, Bob.

435
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,655
You too, sir.

436
00:20:53,721 --> 00:20:58,721
A very Merry Christmas
and a Happy New Year.

437
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,495
Good evening, sir.

438
00:21:00,561 --> 00:21:02,196
Do we have the pleasure
of addressing

439
00:21:02,263 --> 00:21:04,532
Mr. Scrooge or Mr. Marbley?

440
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:06,701
Neither, Mr. Marbley's dead.

441
00:21:06,768 --> 00:21:09,437
And addressing Mr. Scrooge
will be no pleasure.

442
00:21:09,504 --> 00:21:10,505
[knocking on door]

443
00:21:10,571 --> 00:21:12,674
(Scrooge)
'Now what?'

444
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,275
Can't a man get any work done

445
00:21:14,342 --> 00:21:16,344
on this wretched
holiday evening?

446
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:18,513
And a wretched holiday
it will be

447
00:21:18,579 --> 00:21:21,048
for so many of our needy
brothers and sisters.

448
00:21:21,115 --> 00:21:22,717
That's why we're here
to collect money

449
00:21:22,784 --> 00:21:24,952
for the Piltdown
Charitable Foundation.

450
00:21:25,019 --> 00:21:28,890
Ha-ha! What I collect, I keep.

451
00:21:28,957 --> 00:21:32,527
Surely, Mr. Scrooge,
someone as well off as yourself

452
00:21:32,593 --> 00:21:34,261
can afford to donate something.

453
00:21:34,328 --> 00:21:37,498
I certainly can, but I won't.

454
00:21:37,565 --> 00:21:41,002
I support the workhouses,
they cost enough.

455
00:21:41,069 --> 00:21:43,437
Those who are badly off
must go there.

456
00:21:43,504 --> 00:21:45,339
Many can't go there.

457
00:21:45,406 --> 00:21:47,742
And many would rather die.

458
00:21:47,809 --> 00:21:50,344
If they'd rather die,
they had better do it

459
00:21:50,411 --> 00:21:53,781
and decrease
the surplus population.

460
00:21:53,848 --> 00:21:55,783
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

461
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:58,285
I feel sorry for you,
Mr. Scrooge.

462
00:21:58,352 --> 00:22:00,755
Save your pity
for the Piltdown poors.

463
00:22:00,822 --> 00:22:04,325
They'll get nothing from me!

464
00:22:04,325 --> 00:22:06,394
Well, don't just
stand there, Cragit.

465
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,730
You can go too, get out of here!

466
00:22:08,796 --> 00:22:11,766
Uh, t-thank you, sir.
Uh, Merry Christmas, sir.

467
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:16,833
Remember, be here the next
morning bright and early.

468
00:22:19,407 --> 00:22:20,607
[grunts]

469
00:22:25,212 --> 00:22:28,662
Christmas, bah, humbug.

470
00:22:30,351 --> 00:22:31,851
[laughing]

471
00:22:39,026 --> 00:22:39,626
Hey!

472
00:22:44,131 --> 00:22:46,400
Oh, missed me.

473
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,602
Oh!

474
00:22:47,668 --> 00:22:50,968
- Ah, my hat.
- Uh-oh.

475
00:22:54,007 --> 00:22:56,343
Hmm.

476
00:22:56,410 --> 00:23:00,147
My hat. My hat!

477
00:23:00,147 --> 00:23:03,484
Uh-oh.

478
00:23:03,484 --> 00:23:05,286
There he goes, constable.

479
00:23:05,352 --> 00:23:06,687
That juvenile delinquent

480
00:23:06,754 --> 00:23:09,189
'assaulted my hat
with a snowball.'

481
00:23:09,256 --> 00:23:10,958
You, there!

482
00:23:11,024 --> 00:23:12,627
Stop.

483
00:23:12,693 --> 00:23:14,228
- Oh.
- 'Gotcha.'

484
00:23:14,295 --> 00:23:16,530
Alright, my lad, come along.

485
00:23:16,597 --> 00:23:21,336
You've got some
tall explaing to do.

486
00:23:21,336 --> 00:23:24,339
- It, it was accident, guv.
- Just look at this.

487
00:23:24,406 --> 00:23:27,941
This hat was made
of rare sabretooth muskrat.

488
00:23:28,008 --> 00:23:29,744
It's extinct.

489
00:23:29,811 --> 00:23:31,278
If you press charges

490
00:23:31,345 --> 00:23:33,614
I'll have to throw him
in the workhouse.

491
00:23:33,681 --> 00:23:36,183
Oh, no need for that.

492
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,752
Bring him along.

493
00:23:37,819 --> 00:23:42,819
Hey, we was only playing
in the snow.

494
00:23:45,426 --> 00:23:47,695
I'll give you snow, there!

495
00:23:47,762 --> 00:23:50,565
You may shovel a path
to my house.

496
00:23:50,631 --> 00:23:52,600
Get busy and be quick about it

497
00:23:52,667 --> 00:23:57,667
unless you'd prefer
the workhouse.

498
00:23:59,374 --> 00:24:04,374
Uh, this is worse
than the blinking workhouse.

499
00:24:06,547 --> 00:24:10,618
[panting]

500
00:24:10,618 --> 00:24:14,021
Christmas Eve
is supposed to be fun.

501
00:24:14,021 --> 00:24:16,571
Fun, bah, humbug.

502
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:29,503
Scrooge.

503
00:24:29,503 --> 00:24:31,038
Marbley?

504
00:24:31,105 --> 00:24:35,142
[shouting]

505
00:24:35,142 --> 00:24:36,076
'Yaa!'

506
00:24:36,143 --> 00:24:37,344
thud

507
00:24:37,411 --> 00:24:40,314
Impossible.

508
00:24:40,314 --> 00:24:41,682
I must be seeing things.

509
00:24:41,749 --> 00:24:46,749
Probably 'cause I haven't
had any dinner.

510
00:24:48,689 --> 00:24:52,092
(male #6)
'"And so Scrooge
retired to his rooms'

511
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,328
'"in the gloomy old house.'

512
00:24:54,395 --> 00:24:56,330
'"And prepared to spend
Christmas Eve'

513
00:24:56,397 --> 00:24:58,566
'"the way he always did'

514
00:24:58,633 --> 00:25:03,583
'"eating leftover
gruel...alone.'

515
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:10,240
'But this Christmas Eve was
going to be quite different."'

516
00:25:11,712 --> 00:25:15,750
[Marbley howling]
'Scrooge.'

517
00:25:15,817 --> 00:25:18,686
Uh, humbug,
nothing but the wind.

518
00:25:18,753 --> 00:25:20,253
'Scrooge!'

519
00:25:24,725 --> 00:25:27,628
Scrooge.

520
00:25:27,695 --> 00:25:29,296
Who are you?

521
00:25:29,363 --> 00:25:33,968
Ask me who I was.

522
00:25:34,035 --> 00:25:36,604
Alright, alright,
have it your way.

523
00:25:36,671 --> 00:25:37,805
Who were you?

524
00:25:37,872 --> 00:25:42,777
In life, I was your partner

525
00:25:42,844 --> 00:25:45,979
Jacob Marbley.

526
00:25:45,979 --> 00:25:47,414
Hmm..

527
00:25:47,481 --> 00:25:52,354
You don't believe in me,
do you, Scrooge?

528
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,655
You're just a figment
of my imagination

529
00:25:54,722 --> 00:25:56,657
caused by indigestion.

530
00:25:56,724 --> 00:25:58,459
It's that leftover gruel.

531
00:25:58,526 --> 00:26:00,060
Bah.

532
00:26:00,127 --> 00:26:03,497
Scrooge!

533
00:26:03,497 --> 00:26:07,167
Dreadful apparition,
why do you trouble me?

534
00:26:07,234 --> 00:26:11,338
Do you believe in me or not?

535
00:26:11,405 --> 00:26:13,875
I believe, I believe.

536
00:26:13,941 --> 00:26:16,277
But why trouble me now?

537
00:26:16,344 --> 00:26:20,113
You who've been dead
for seven long years.

538
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:22,650
Yes.

539
00:26:22,717 --> 00:26:26,387
Seven years dead.

540
00:26:26,453 --> 00:26:29,190
But the chains, why?

541
00:26:29,257 --> 00:26:33,428
I wear the chain
I forged in life.

542
00:26:33,495 --> 00:26:37,665
I made it link by link
and yard by yard.

543
00:26:37,732 --> 00:26:40,668
Do you know the weight
of the strong coil

544
00:26:40,735 --> 00:26:43,204
you bear yourself?

545
00:26:43,271 --> 00:26:47,842
And, Scrooge, no amount
of regret can make amends

546
00:26:47,909 --> 00:26:52,580
for a life's worth
of opportunities misused.

547
00:26:52,647 --> 00:26:54,348
Misused?

548
00:26:54,415 --> 00:26:55,449
But, Jacob

549
00:26:55,516 --> 00:26:58,052
you were always
a good man of business.

550
00:26:58,119 --> 00:27:01,323
Mankind was my business.

551
00:27:01,389 --> 00:27:04,592
The common welfare
was my business.

552
00:27:04,659 --> 00:27:07,595
Charity, mercy and benevolence

553
00:27:07,662 --> 00:27:10,832
were all my business.

554
00:27:10,898 --> 00:27:13,435
[howling]

555
00:27:13,435 --> 00:27:17,070
That doesn't sound like
my old partner Marbley.

556
00:27:17,137 --> 00:27:19,407
Too true, Scrooge.

557
00:27:19,474 --> 00:27:23,644
In life, my spirit never walked
beyond our counting house.

558
00:27:23,711 --> 00:27:26,447
And now, at this time of year

559
00:27:26,514 --> 00:27:30,017
I suffer the most.

560
00:27:30,017 --> 00:27:31,519
[screaming]

561
00:27:31,585 --> 00:27:34,522
No rest, no peace

00:27:34,588 --> 00:27:38,158
only incessant torture

563
00:27:38,225 --> 00:27:40,728
and remorse.

564
00:27:40,795 --> 00:27:43,531
I-I'm-I'm sorry things aren't
going well, Jacob.

565
00:27:43,597 --> 00:27:44,966
[screaming]

566
00:27:45,033 --> 00:27:47,668
Hear me, Scrooge.

567
00:27:47,735 --> 00:27:50,371
My time is nearly gone.

568
00:27:50,437 --> 00:27:53,975
- I am here to warn you.
- Of what?

569
00:27:54,042 --> 00:27:58,445
That you still have a hope
of escaping my fate.

570
00:27:58,512 --> 00:28:01,281
Your fate? Wait!

571
00:28:01,348 --> 00:28:05,887
[Marbley howling]

572
00:28:05,887 --> 00:28:07,537
'Don't go!'

573
00:28:11,059 --> 00:28:13,127
You will be haunted

574
00:28:13,194 --> 00:28:16,063
by three more spirits tonight.

575
00:28:16,129 --> 00:28:17,732
More ghosts?

576
00:28:17,798 --> 00:28:21,702
Expect the first tonight

577
00:28:21,769 --> 00:28:25,240
when the clock
strikes midnight.

578
00:28:25,306 --> 00:28:27,942
Wait, can't they all
visit me at once

579
00:28:28,009 --> 00:28:30,377
so I can get it over with?

580
00:28:30,444 --> 00:28:32,947
Wait!

581
00:28:32,947 --> 00:28:35,797
Not this time, pal.

582
00:28:40,621 --> 00:28:44,158
(Marbley)
Farewell, Scrooge.

583
00:28:44,225 --> 00:28:48,495
Expect me no more
and for your own sake

584
00:28:48,562 --> 00:28:52,299
remember what has passed
between us.

585
00:28:52,366 --> 00:28:57,204

Ghosts.

588
00:28:59,807 --> 00:29:02,343
Uh, this is nothing
but my imagination.

589
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:05,980
Like I said, nothing but a bit
of bad leftover gruel.

590
00:29:06,047 --> 00:29:07,115
I'm going to bed.

591
00:29:07,181 --> 00:29:08,983
And when I wake up
in the morning

592
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:14,050
this will all be
just a bad dream.

593

Hear that applause, Barn?
They really like me.

598
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:35,643
Uh, gee, Fred, I think they
like me and Mr. Slate too.

599
00:29:35,709 --> 00:29:38,245
You? Don't be silly, Barn.

600
00:29:38,312 --> 00:29:39,680
I'm the star.

601
00:29:39,747 --> 00:29:41,882
Uh, oh, yeah, I forgot.

602
00:29:41,949 --> 00:29:44,585
- Not bad, Fred.
- Thanks, Wilma.

603
00:29:44,652 --> 00:29:47,187
Yeah, you're really
cooking tonight.

604
00:29:47,254 --> 00:29:49,023
Perfect for ham.

606
00:29:51,326 --> 00:29:52,693
- Places, everybody.
- 'Oh, boy.'

Curtain's going up.

608
00:29:56,998 --> 00:29:59,901
Mister, could you please lower
your head so my kid can see.

609
00:29:59,967 --> 00:30:03,738

Betty, where's the ghost
of Christmas past?

617
00:30:21,623 --> 00:30:24,792
Garnet? Gee, I did her makeup
ten minutes ago.

618
00:30:24,859 --> 00:30:28,763
Maybe she's still
in her dressing room.

619
00:30:28,763 --> 00:30:32,132
Garnet?

620
00:30:32,132 --> 00:30:33,267
You're..

Sick.

My word.

624
00:30:42,643 --> 00:30:43,611
Don't tell me..

(in unison)
The Bedrock Bug!

626
00:30:46,514 --> 00:30:49,951
Now, where are we going to find
a ghost of Christmas past.

627
00:30:50,017 --> 00:30:52,153
Never mind that,
who could possibly

628
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:56,757
even squeeze into her dress?

629
00:30:56,757 --> 00:30:59,360
'Hey, Wilma, maybe you can.'

630
00:30:59,427 --> 00:31:01,629
Besides, who else knows
everybody's part?

631
00:31:01,695 --> 00:31:04,832
Please, Wilma, you must.

632
00:31:04,899 --> 00:31:08,470

'Wake up, Scrooge.'

aren't you?'

Oh!

636
00:31:20,848 --> 00:31:22,850
Wilma, I-I mean..

637
00:31:22,917 --> 00:31:26,120
Are you the spirit
whose coming was foretold to me?

638
00:31:26,187 --> 00:31:28,956
I am the ghost
of Christmas past.

639
00:31:29,023 --> 00:31:33,027
- Long past?
- No, your past.

640
00:31:33,094 --> 00:31:37,297
I'm here to help you,
rise and walk with me.

641
00:31:37,364 --> 00:31:39,233
Wait!

642
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,969
I'm just a mortal, I'll fall.

643
00:31:42,036 --> 00:31:45,340
Just a touch of my hand, there.

644
00:31:45,406 --> 00:31:48,408
And you shall be upheld.

00:31:48,408 --> 00:31:50,377
Ow!

No.

00:31:55,149 --> 00:31:58,052
Take it easy, Wilma,
we're supposed to be acting.

00:31:58,119 --> 00:32:02,089
Sorry, Fred, you're such
a convincing scrooge, I forgot.

00:35:02,002 --> 00:35:04,806
and sent me in a coach
to bring you.

712
00:35:04,873 --> 00:35:08,976
Oh, Fanny, now I'll never
have to be alone again.

713
00:35:09,043 --> 00:35:10,478
You won't leave me, will you?

714
00:35:10,545 --> 00:35:13,247
[laughs]
Of course not, silly.

715
00:35:13,314 --> 00:35:15,182
I'm taking you home.

716
00:35:15,249 --> 00:35:17,351
[laughs]

717
00:35:17,418 --> 00:35:19,887
No, I mean forever, Fanny.

718
00:35:19,954 --> 00:35:24,459
We must always be together.

719
00:35:24,459 --> 00:35:26,561
[Fanny laughing]

720
00:35:26,628 --> 00:35:29,263
Such a delicate creature,
your sister.

721
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:33,367
But she had a large heart.

722
00:35:33,367 --> 00:35:36,770
And she did leave you.

723
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:39,974
She died as a young woman.

724
00:35:39,974 --> 00:35:42,811
- She had children?
- My nephew.

725
00:35:42,877 --> 00:35:47,182
You loved your sister,
Fan, didn't you?

726
00:35:47,182 --> 00:35:52,182
And when she died, I said
I'd never love anyone again.

727
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,170
- Come.
- Huh, ooh!

728
00:36:02,196 --> 00:36:06,033
But you did love again,
didn't you, Scrooge?

729
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,936
You, you did-don't mean Belle.

730
00:36:09,003 --> 00:36:11,339
Yes, you met her at Fezziwig's.

731
00:36:11,405 --> 00:36:14,241
It was at Christmas time,
remember?

732
00:36:14,308 --> 00:36:17,811
How can I forget? Old Fezziwig.

733
00:36:17,878 --> 00:36:19,781
I was apprenticed to him.

734
00:36:19,848 --> 00:36:23,584
Why, that's him.
Old Fezziwig, bless his heart.

735
00:36:23,651 --> 00:36:26,086
'It's Fezziwig, alive again.'

736
00:36:26,153 --> 00:36:28,489
And this is Christmas Eve.

737
00:36:28,556 --> 00:36:30,124
But how is this possible?

738
00:36:30,191 --> 00:36:34,662
I'm only showing you
what has already been.

739
00:36:34,662 --> 00:36:37,965
Yo-ho, my boys,
no more work tonight.

740
00:36:38,032 --> 00:36:41,702
Christmas Eve, Jacob.

741
00:36:41,702 --> 00:36:43,170
Christmas, Ebonezer.

742
00:36:43,237 --> 00:36:46,441
Clear away, my lads,
and let's have some room here.

743
00:36:46,507 --> 00:36:49,244
It's time to party!

744
00:36:49,311 --> 00:36:52,179
- Did you hear the one about..
- You gotta be kidding.

745
00:36:52,246 --> 00:36:55,951
[instrumental music]

746
00:36:55,951 --> 00:36:59,019
A small matter to make
these silly folks so happy.

747
00:36:59,086 --> 00:37:00,388
Small?

748
00:37:00,455 --> 00:37:02,156
(Wilma)
Certainly no more
than a few dollars.

749
00:37:02,223 --> 00:37:04,592
(Scrooge)
It isn't the money.

750
00:37:04,659 --> 00:37:09,659
The happiness he gives
can't be measured in gold.

751
00:37:09,798 --> 00:37:12,834
What's the matter, Betty?
Am I that bad?

752
00:37:12,901 --> 00:37:16,036
You're doing a lot better
than she is.

753
00:37:16,103 --> 00:37:17,204
[groaning]

754
00:37:17,271 --> 00:37:18,473
[retching]

755
00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:22,276
Maggie? The Bedrock Bug?

756
00:37:22,343 --> 00:37:24,512
Think you can handle
another part?

757
00:37:24,579 --> 00:37:28,349
Do I have a choice?

758
00:37:28,349 --> 00:37:31,385
[laughs]
Dance, Ebonezer.

759
00:37:31,452 --> 00:37:34,755
With one of my daughters,
perhaps.

760
00:37:34,755 --> 00:37:36,992
[giggling]

761
00:37:37,058 --> 00:37:42,058
I've never been much
for dancing, Mrs. Fezziwig.

762
00:37:43,697 --> 00:37:45,500
[laughing]

763
00:37:45,566 --> 00:37:49,504
But in her case,
I'll make an exception.

764
00:37:49,504 --> 00:37:51,539
May I have this dance, Miss..

765
00:37:51,606 --> 00:37:54,709
- Wilma?
- Shh, don't blow your lines.

766
00:37:54,776 --> 00:37:59,313
The name is Belle,
and you dance divinely, mister..

767
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:02,483
Ebonezer Scrooge.

768
00:38:02,483 --> 00:38:03,651
What happened to Maggie?

769
00:38:03,718 --> 00:38:05,720
I'm supposed to be doing
this scene with her.

770
00:38:05,787 --> 00:38:09,423
Oh, you'd rather do your love
scene with her instead of me?

771
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:10,424
[Fred groans]

772
00:38:10,491 --> 00:38:12,994
I didn't mean that, I meant..

773
00:38:13,061 --> 00:38:16,663
You're so light on your feet,
Miss Belle.

774
00:38:16,663 --> 00:38:17,764
Oh! Ow!

775
00:38:17,831 --> 00:38:19,331
[shouting]

776
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:27,675
Ah!

777
00:38:27,675 --> 00:38:31,278
Now do you rember
the night you met Belle?

778
00:38:31,345 --> 00:38:33,514
- Oh, I do!
- You did love her.

779
00:38:33,581 --> 00:38:36,250
I, I mean, I did.

780
00:38:36,317 --> 00:38:41,317
- My time grows short, come.
- Ooh!

781
00:38:49,363 --> 00:38:53,713
Very funny, Wilma, uh, Belle.

782
00:38:54,903 --> 00:38:57,004
None of this is in my script.

783
00:38:57,071 --> 00:38:59,107
[laughing]

784
00:38:59,174 --> 00:39:02,410
I suppose you think...
this is funny.

785
00:39:02,476 --> 00:39:07,348
[laughs]

786
00:39:07,348 --> 00:39:08,816
Belle, wait.

787
00:39:08,883 --> 00:39:12,086
There's something
I want to say to you.

788
00:39:12,152 --> 00:39:14,654
Belle, will you marry me?

789
00:39:14,721 --> 00:39:16,758
Uh, yes.

790
00:39:16,824 --> 00:39:20,061
Oh, yes, Fre-uh, Ebonezer.

791
00:39:20,128 --> 00:39:25,128
- I love you.
- And I love you, Belle.

792
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:28,700
[instrumental music]

793
00:39:39,179 --> 00:39:41,382
Please, Ebonezer, take it back.

794
00:39:41,449 --> 00:39:43,051
But why, Belle?

795
00:39:43,118 --> 00:39:47,020
Another idol has taken
my place in your heart.

796
00:39:47,087 --> 00:39:48,689
A golden one.

797
00:39:48,756 --> 00:39:51,559
You're a different man.

798
00:39:51,626 --> 00:39:56,626
I haven't changed toward you,
I've grown wiser.

799
00:39:56,898 --> 00:39:58,733
- 'I was only a boy.'
- 'Yes.'

800
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,803
But promised great joy
when you were a boy.

801
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:05,540
Promises only misery for us now,
now that you're a man.

802
00:40:05,606 --> 00:40:07,841
But have I asked
to end our engagement?

803
00:40:07,908 --> 00:40:09,276
In words, no.

804
00:40:09,343 --> 00:40:11,179
But if you could choose now

805
00:40:11,246 --> 00:40:16,016
would you choose a poor girl
like me to marry?

806
00:40:16,016 --> 00:40:19,253
- Well..
- Say no more.

807
00:40:19,253 --> 00:40:22,057
[sniffs]

808
00:40:22,057 --> 00:40:25,760
With a full heart for the love
of the man you once were

809
00:40:25,827 --> 00:40:29,430
'I set you free,
Ebonezer Scrooge.'

810
00:40:29,497 --> 00:40:30,598
Belle..

811
00:40:30,665 --> 00:40:32,433
[crying]
May you be happy

812
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,468
in the life you've chosen.

813
00:40:34,535 --> 00:40:35,769
[sobbing]

814
00:40:35,836 --> 00:40:37,938
But I do..

815
00:40:38,005 --> 00:40:39,508
I did love her.

816
00:40:39,575 --> 00:40:42,410
(female #3)
'But you loved money
and yourself more.'

817
00:40:42,476 --> 00:40:45,847
Spirit, why do you delight
in torturing me?

818
00:40:45,914 --> 00:40:49,451
Take me home,
show me no more, no more.

819
00:40:49,518 --> 00:40:52,787
(female #3)
'You have seen only things
that have already been.'

820
00:40:52,854 --> 00:40:55,090
'That they've happened
isn't my fault.'

821
00:40:55,156 --> 00:40:59,159
No more. No more.
No more! No more.

822
00:40:59,226 --> 00:41:01,362
No more!

823
00:41:01,429 --> 00:41:05,400
[applauding]

824
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,336
Uh, gee, I-I guess all that
rehearsal paid off, Fred.

825
00:41:08,403 --> 00:41:10,304
You've got them eating
out of the palm of your hand.

826
00:41:10,371 --> 00:41:13,507
Forget about me,
what's eating Wilma?

827
00:41:13,574 --> 00:41:15,710
Those tears looked
awful real, Barn.

828
00:41:15,777 --> 00:41:18,880
- She is a little upset, Fred.
- About what?

829
00:41:18,947 --> 00:41:21,682
You mean besides forgetting
about Pebbles

830
00:41:21,749 --> 00:41:26,287
and being a selfish,
self-centered scrooge?

831
00:41:26,287 --> 00:41:27,755
- Me?
- Yep.

832
00:41:27,822 --> 00:41:32,822
Well, maybe I should go
talk to her.

833
00:41:32,993 --> 00:41:34,329
[Wilma sobbing]

834
00:41:34,396 --> 00:41:38,466
(Wilma)
'Oh, that selfish,
self-centered scrooge.'

835
00:41:38,532 --> 00:41:40,268
- 'He only thinks of himself.'
- What?

836
00:41:40,335 --> 00:41:43,238
I don't think she wants
to see you right now, Fred.

837
00:41:43,305 --> 00:41:46,007
- She's a little emotional.
- But..

838
00:41:46,074 --> 00:41:47,541
'And why shouldn't she be?'

839
00:41:47,608 --> 00:41:50,110
Forgetting your own daughter?

840
00:41:50,177 --> 00:41:53,847
Shame on you.

841
00:41:53,847 --> 00:41:56,116
Hmm.

842
00:41:56,183 --> 00:41:57,852
Wilma won't even talk to me.

843
00:41:57,919 --> 00:42:00,621
I don't get it, I haven't
knocked over any scenery.

844
00:42:00,688 --> 00:42:03,257
- She should be proud.
- Take it easy, Fred.

845
00:42:03,324 --> 00:42:04,592
Tomorrow's Christmas.

846
00:42:04,659 --> 00:42:06,027
How can Wilma stay mad

847
00:42:06,094 --> 00:42:08,429
when she's opening
your presents under the tree.

848
00:42:08,496 --> 00:42:10,197
Right, presents.

849
00:42:10,264 --> 00:42:12,232
Oh, presents!

850
00:42:12,299 --> 00:42:13,768
[shouting]

851
00:42:13,835 --> 00:42:17,585
You're on in ten minutes!

852
00:42:23,778 --> 00:42:28,282
Ten minutes is plenty of time to
get to Bloomingshales and back.

853
00:42:28,282 --> 00:42:29,817
[gasps]

854
00:42:29,884 --> 00:42:31,151
'Oh, no!'

855
00:42:31,218 --> 00:42:33,454
If I could get my car out.

856
00:42:33,521 --> 00:42:34,722
Better make a run for it.

857
00:42:34,789 --> 00:42:36,791
Flintstone, you scrooge.

858
00:42:36,858 --> 00:42:39,727
How could you forget
the present?

859
00:42:39,794 --> 00:42:40,795
[panting]

860
00:42:40,862 --> 00:42:41,929
Wilma and Pebbles

861
00:42:41,996 --> 00:42:44,532
are never gonna
speak to me a-again!

862
00:42:44,598 --> 00:42:46,900
[shouting]

863
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,970
Ow!

864
00:42:49,037 --> 00:42:51,972
"Closed early
for Christmas Eve."

865
00:42:52,039 --> 00:42:53,741
Oh, no.

866
00:42:53,808 --> 00:42:57,278
Let me in. You gotta let me in!

867
00:42:57,345 --> 00:43:02,345
There's gotta be
another way into this place.

868
00:43:05,919 --> 00:43:07,187
Ah!

869
00:43:07,254 --> 00:43:08,556
[grunts]

870
00:43:08,622 --> 00:43:10,725
Huh?

871
00:43:10,791 --> 00:43:13,927
Oh, boy.

872
00:43:13,927 --> 00:43:18,432
[yowling]

873
00:43:18,432 --> 00:43:21,902
Flintstone, you're a genius.

874
00:43:21,902 --> 00:43:23,102
[grunts]

875
00:43:27,074 --> 00:43:30,210
Shh.

876
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:31,679
Wow, how does Santa Claus

877
00:43:31,746 --> 00:43:35,449
come down
those skinny little chimneys?

878
00:43:35,449 --> 00:43:37,118
'Where are my presents?'

879
00:43:37,185 --> 00:43:39,353
That kid must've
stolen my presents.

880
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:41,289
And I thought I was the scrooge.

881
00:43:41,356 --> 00:43:43,958
Well, so much
for Christmas spirit.

882
00:43:44,025 --> 00:43:45,526
If I ever catch that kid, I'll--

883
00:43:45,593 --> 00:43:49,330
- Scro-oge!
- Huh?

884
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:53,167
Scro-oge.

885
00:43:53,167 --> 00:43:54,369
Places, everybody.

886
00:43:54,436 --> 00:43:56,204
- 'Don't forget your cue.'
- 'Who, me?'

887
00:43:56,271 --> 00:43:59,240
- Ernie, have you seen Fred?
- Sorry, Wilma.

888
00:43:59,307 --> 00:44:02,743
Oh, just like the great actor.

889
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:04,312
We're on in three minutes

890
00:44:04,379 --> 00:44:07,281
and he's probably off
signing autograph.

891
00:44:07,348 --> 00:44:09,984
[screaming]

892
00:44:09,984 --> 00:44:11,118
The ghost of Christmas
yet to come.

893
00:44:11,185 --> 00:44:12,419
'Scro-ooge.'

894
00:44:12,486 --> 00:44:14,922
But it, it can't be!

895
00:44:14,989 --> 00:44:17,658
'You're not, not real.'

896
00:44:17,725 --> 00:44:20,127
Scro-oge.

897
00:44:20,194 --> 00:44:21,829
Wait, spirit.

898
00:44:21,896 --> 00:44:23,431
I am not the man I was.

899
00:44:23,498 --> 00:44:25,933
I know I've been selfish,
but I've changed.

900
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,636
Please don't hurt me.

901
00:44:28,703 --> 00:44:30,905
[screaming]

902
00:44:30,905 --> 00:44:33,541
Fred, it's me, Philo Quartz.

903
00:44:33,607 --> 00:44:35,043
'I was on my way to the theater'

904
00:44:35,109 --> 00:44:37,778
when I got a silent alarm
about a break in.

905
00:44:37,845 --> 00:44:40,381
Honest, honest,
I wasn't stealing anything.

906
00:44:40,447 --> 00:44:45,247
You can explain on the way back.

907
00:44:45,587 --> 00:44:48,323
I knew you'd understand, pal,
see you in the third act.

908
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:53,294
Oh, and by the way,
thanks for the lift.

909
00:44:53,294 --> 00:44:56,398
- Well, it's about time.
- Sorry I'm late.

910
00:44:56,464 --> 00:44:58,799
- Listen, honey, I need--
- You always need.

911
00:44:58,866 --> 00:45:02,503
And don't "Honey" me, you're on.

912
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:04,839
Okay, okay.

913
00:45:04,839 --> 00:45:06,639
[applauding]

914
00:45:10,845 --> 00:45:12,479
[snoring]

915
00:45:12,546 --> 00:45:17,251
(male #7)
'Scro-oge.'

916
00:45:17,251 --> 00:45:18,318
Huh? What?

917
00:45:18,385 --> 00:45:21,956
'Who, who...who-who is it?'

918
00:45:21,956 --> 00:45:25,860
Must be my imagination.

919
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:28,061
'Scro-oge.'

920
00:45:28,128 --> 00:45:29,628
[laughing]

921
00:45:33,834 --> 00:45:34,969
[gasps]

922
00:45:35,036 --> 00:45:37,872
I am the ghost
of Christmas present.

923
00:45:37,939 --> 00:45:39,206
[laughs]

924
00:45:39,273 --> 00:45:41,609
Come, look upon me.

925
00:45:41,675 --> 00:45:45,547
I'm looking, I'm looking.

926
00:45:45,547 --> 00:45:49,717
You have never seen
the like of me before.

927
00:45:49,784 --> 00:45:50,785
Never, never.

928
00:45:50,851 --> 00:45:52,052
[laughing]

929
00:45:52,119 --> 00:45:53,387
Whoa!

930
00:45:53,454 --> 00:45:55,623
Spirit, take me where you will

931
00:45:55,689 --> 00:45:58,126
and if you have anything
to teach me

932
00:45:58,192 --> 00:45:59,994
'hopefully I'll profit by it.'

933
00:46:00,061 --> 00:46:03,530
Do you know
what time it is, Scrooge?

934
00:46:03,597 --> 00:46:04,565
Time to eat?

935
00:46:04,632 --> 00:46:06,734
[laughing]

936
00:46:06,801 --> 00:46:08,903
Christmas morning.

937
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:11,970
Come, touch my robe.

938
00:46:16,577 --> 00:46:18,779
[bell chiming]

939
00:46:18,846 --> 00:46:20,682
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

940
00:46:20,749 --> 00:46:25,749
- Look at all this.
- Merry Christmas, Miss Meduser.

941
00:46:27,455 --> 00:46:32,455
'It's Christmas morning,
Scrooge.'

942
00:46:35,062 --> 00:46:38,766
Someone will have a merry feast
of that prize bird.

943
00:46:38,766 --> 00:46:39,934
Oop!

944
00:46:40,001 --> 00:46:42,436
Isn't it wonderful?

945
00:46:42,503 --> 00:46:44,705
Hmm, delicious.

946
00:46:44,772 --> 00:46:48,343
Come, Scrooge,
there's much more to see.

947
00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:51,679
Yeah, but not too much to eat.

948
00:46:51,679 --> 00:46:52,813
'What's that?'

949
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:56,017
My own special seasoning.

950
00:46:56,084 --> 00:46:57,985
Christmas spirit.

951
00:46:58,052 --> 00:47:01,089
And it works on any kind
of dinner on this day?

952
00:47:01,155 --> 00:47:02,823
To any dinner kindly given.

953
00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:06,027
And to a poor one most of all.

954
00:47:06,094 --> 00:47:07,762
Why to a poor one most?

955
00:47:07,828 --> 00:47:11,532
Because it needs it most.

956
00:47:11,532 --> 00:47:14,535
- 'Ah, here we are.'
- Huh?

957
00:47:14,602 --> 00:47:16,837
If the poor are so blessed

958
00:47:16,904 --> 00:47:19,073
why do you leave them
in such misery?

959
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:23,578
I? Many evils are done
in the name of goodness.

960
00:47:23,645 --> 00:47:27,949
But deeds of pride,
hatred, envy, bigotry

961
00:47:28,015 --> 00:47:30,351
and selfishness
must be attributed

962
00:47:30,418 --> 00:47:34,468
to their true perpetrators.

963
00:47:35,589 --> 00:47:36,724
I don't understand.

964
00:47:36,791 --> 00:47:39,593
This is my clerk,
Bob Cragit's house.

965
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:43,363
Let's go inside, shall we?

966
00:47:43,363 --> 00:47:44,713
[barking]

967
00:47:49,369 --> 00:47:52,006
Huh?

968
00:47:52,006 --> 00:47:56,043
- We're home, mother.
- Uh, da-da.

969
00:47:56,110 --> 00:47:58,813
They can't see us,
can they, ghost?

970
00:47:58,879 --> 00:48:02,116
(male #7)
'No, Scrooge, they can't.'

971
00:48:02,116 --> 00:48:06,854
[barking]

972
00:48:06,854 --> 00:48:08,555
And how did little Tim behave?

973
00:48:08,622 --> 00:48:10,992
As good as gold and better.

974
00:48:11,058 --> 00:48:12,460
'He told me, coming home'

975
00:48:12,527 --> 00:48:15,830
that he hoped people saw him
in the church.

976
00:48:15,896 --> 00:48:17,198
Because he was a cripple

977
00:48:17,265 --> 00:48:20,669
and it might be pleasant to them
to rember on Christmas day

978
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:25,735
who made lame beggars walk
and blind men see.

979
00:48:25,773 --> 00:48:27,123
[sobbing]

980
00:48:31,378 --> 00:48:34,915
[laughing]

981
00:48:34,915 --> 00:48:39,915
Time for Christmas dinner,
you two.

982
00:48:42,123 --> 00:48:44,758
Was there ever
such a glorious bird.

983
00:48:44,825 --> 00:48:46,361
[sniffs]

984
00:48:46,427 --> 00:48:49,564
The most delicious
chickasaurus you ever made.

985
00:48:49,631 --> 00:48:52,233
[sniffs]
It does smell good.

986
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:54,902
'And they seem like
such a happy family.'

987
00:48:54,969 --> 00:48:57,138
But it's such a meager meal.

988
00:48:57,205 --> 00:48:59,673
I'm afraid it's all a clerk
in your employee

989
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:02,076
'can afford, Scrooge.'

990
00:49:02,143 --> 00:49:04,812
A merry Christmas to us all,
my dears.

991
00:49:04,879 --> 00:49:07,347
- God bless us.
- God bless us.

992
00:49:07,414 --> 00:49:08,416
[babbles]

993
00:49:08,483 --> 00:49:11,085
God bless us, everyone.

994
00:49:11,152 --> 00:49:14,255
He seems so...so weak.

995
00:49:14,322 --> 00:49:15,923
(male #7)
'It's no concern of yours.'

996
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:20,990
Spirit, tell me,
will-will Tiny Tim live?

997
00:49:21,195 --> 00:49:23,097
[laughing]

998
00:49:23,164 --> 00:49:26,501
I see a vacant seat
in the poor chimney corner

999
00:49:26,568 --> 00:49:30,304
and a crutch without an owner,
carefully preserved.

1000
00:49:30,371 --> 00:49:33,574
If these shadows
remain unaltered by the future

1001
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,042
the child will die.

1002
00:49:35,109 --> 00:49:36,077
No, no!

1003
00:49:36,143 --> 00:49:38,012
Oh, oh, no, kind spirit.

1004
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:39,980
Say he will be spared.

1005
00:49:40,047 --> 00:49:41,449
(male #7)
'So what if he dies?'

1006
00:49:41,516 --> 00:49:45,486
He'll just decrease
the surplus population.

1007
00:49:45,553 --> 00:49:49,490
I give you Mr. Scrooge,
the founder of this feast.

1008
00:49:49,557 --> 00:49:52,560
The founder
of this feast indeed.

1009
00:49:52,627 --> 00:49:55,462
If he was here, I'd give him a
piece of my mind to feast upon.

1010
00:49:55,529 --> 00:49:57,198
[snarls]

1011
00:49:57,265 --> 00:50:01,002
He's selfish, self-centered
and only thinks of himself.

1012
00:50:01,068 --> 00:50:03,403
[yells]
Not very popular, am I?

1013
00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:05,439
[barking]

1014
00:50:05,506 --> 00:50:06,707
Haah!

1015
00:50:06,774 --> 00:50:09,010
Phew, huh!

1016
00:50:09,076 --> 00:50:11,713
But, my dear,
it's Christmas day.

1017
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:15,416
Yes, only on Christmas day
could one make a toast

1018
00:50:15,483 --> 00:50:18,052
to the health
of such an odious, stingy

1019
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:21,623
hard, unfeeling man
as Mr. Scrooge.

1020
00:50:21,690 --> 00:50:23,758
I'll toast his health
for your sake

1021
00:50:23,825 --> 00:50:26,361
and because it's Christmas,
not for his.

1022
00:50:26,427 --> 00:50:29,463
A merry Christmas
and a Happy New Year

1023
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:31,800
to Mr. Scrooge.

1024
00:50:31,867 --> 00:50:34,268
- I've seen enough, spirit.
- Come, Scrooge.

1025
00:50:34,335 --> 00:50:39,285
There are more parties
to attend.

1026
00:50:42,776 --> 00:50:45,345
[laughing]

1027
00:50:45,345 --> 00:50:46,280
Huh?

1028
00:50:46,347 --> 00:50:49,150
Why, that's my nephew, Ned.

1029
00:50:49,217 --> 00:50:52,186
'Oh, look,
they're playing charades.'

1030
00:50:52,253 --> 00:50:54,723
'So that's my nephew's wife.'

1031
00:50:54,789 --> 00:50:56,657
'Almost reminds me
of my sister.'

1032
00:50:56,724 --> 00:50:58,626
Two syllables.

1033
00:50:58,693 --> 00:51:01,528
- 'Fish.'
- 'He's quite good, my nephew.'

1034
00:51:01,595 --> 00:51:03,999
Very clever.

1035
00:51:04,066 --> 00:51:07,701
(male #7)
'Don't tell me you've never met
your own nephew's wife.'

1036
00:51:07,768 --> 00:51:09,303
- 'No.'
- 'Fishmonger!'

1037
00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:12,340
- 'Sells fish.'
- That's not right.

1038
00:51:12,407 --> 00:51:15,076
Sell fish, selfish!

1039
00:51:15,142 --> 00:51:17,712
Oh, very clever girl.

1040
00:51:17,779 --> 00:51:21,349
- 'Having a good time?'
- 'Oh, I'm having a grand time.'

1041
00:51:21,416 --> 00:51:23,051
(male #8)
'Screwdriver?'

1042
00:51:23,118 --> 00:51:25,854
(male #7)
'See what you've missed by
heeding the clinking of coins'

1043
00:51:25,921 --> 00:51:29,357
'instead of the sounds
of laughter and merriment?'

1044
00:51:29,424 --> 00:51:32,693
Screw, uh, Scrooge!

1045
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,395
Uncle Scrooge, get it?

1046
00:51:34,462 --> 00:51:37,198
Selfish, cheap Uncle Scrooge.

1047
00:51:37,265 --> 00:51:40,201
Yes, but he's given us all
a wonderful evening

1048
00:51:40,268 --> 00:51:42,270
and here's to him.

1049
00:51:42,336 --> 00:51:44,706
(in unison)
'Here's to Uncle Scrooge.'

1050
00:51:44,773 --> 00:51:48,409
Uh, they've included me
in their fun.

1051
00:51:48,476 --> 00:51:50,678
Nice boy, your nephew.

1052
00:51:50,745 --> 00:51:53,615
Ned? Oh, he's a wonderful boy.

1053
00:51:53,681 --> 00:51:57,751
[sniffles]
He has the good heart
of my sister Fan

1054
00:51:57,818 --> 00:51:59,487
who I loved so dearly.

1055
00:51:59,554 --> 00:52:01,922
Come, Scrooge, it's time.

1056
00:52:01,989 --> 00:52:03,257
Must we go, spirit?

1057
00:52:03,324 --> 00:52:06,527
Can't-can't we stay just,
just a little longer?

1058
00:52:06,594 --> 00:52:10,764
My time upon this globe is over.

1059
00:52:10,764 --> 00:52:14,335
[bell tolling]

1060
00:52:14,335 --> 00:52:18,205
[squawks]
It's midnight.

1061
00:52:18,205 --> 00:52:20,241
Spirit? Where are you?

1062
00:52:20,308 --> 00:52:21,608
[yells]

1063
00:52:21,675 --> 00:52:22,875
[groans]

1064
00:52:29,517 --> 00:52:33,354
I'm in the presence of the ghost
of Christmas yet to come.

1065
00:52:33,421 --> 00:52:36,658
You're about to show me shadows
of things that have not happened

1066
00:52:36,724 --> 00:52:41,724
but will happen in the time
before us, is that so, spirit?

1067
00:52:43,798 --> 00:52:48,235
Ghost of the future, I fear you
more than any specter I've seen.

1068
00:52:48,302 --> 00:52:50,538
Oh, but I know your purpose
is to do me good.

1069
00:52:50,605 --> 00:52:54,355
Will you not speak to me?

1070
00:52:58,879 --> 00:53:03,250
Then lead on, phantom.

1071
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:06,250
[instrumental music]

1072
00:53:10,859 --> 00:53:14,028
- When did he die?
- Last night, I believe.

1073
00:53:14,094 --> 00:53:16,130
I thought he'd never die.

1074
00:53:16,197 --> 00:53:18,799
I wonder who he left
all his money to.

1075
00:53:18,866 --> 00:53:20,334
Haven't heard, guv.

1076
00:53:20,401 --> 00:53:23,571
But he hasn't left it to me,
that's all I know.

1077
00:53:23,638 --> 00:53:27,209
Spirit, what has all this
to do with me?

1078
00:53:27,276 --> 00:53:32,046
And why am I not in my
accustomed place at this hour?

1079
00:53:32,046 --> 00:53:34,296
[intense music]

1080
00:53:37,618 --> 00:53:39,053
[Scrooge gulps]

1081
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:40,789
Where are we, spirit?

1082
00:53:40,855 --> 00:53:43,791
[yells]
Oh, oh, I don't like this place.

1083
00:53:43,857 --> 00:53:45,926
Please, can't we go?

1084
00:53:45,993 --> 00:53:47,761
'No, no, no, I won't look.'

1085
00:53:47,828 --> 00:53:49,430
'You can't make me.'

1086
00:53:49,497 --> 00:53:51,566
Is there no one
in this whole town

1087
00:53:51,633 --> 00:53:56,633
who feels any emotion
about this man's death?

1088
00:54:05,779 --> 00:54:08,749
After you, please.

1089
00:54:08,749 --> 00:54:10,249
[laughing]

1090
00:54:13,855 --> 00:54:18,855
Spirit, what have these
miscreants to do with me?

1091
00:54:20,695 --> 00:54:24,065
It's all I could scrounge,
but it is something

1092
00:54:24,132 --> 00:54:27,067
and everyone has a right
to take care of himself, eh?

1093
00:54:27,134 --> 00:54:30,005
After all, he always did.

1094
00:54:30,005 --> 00:54:32,607
I'm afraid
this is all there was.

1095
00:54:32,674 --> 00:54:34,709
Now, who's next?

1096
00:54:34,776 --> 00:54:39,213
Please, spirit, no more.

1097
00:54:39,213 --> 00:54:42,450
Well, what'll you pay, Joe?

1098
00:54:42,517 --> 00:54:43,751
[laughing]

1099
00:54:43,818 --> 00:54:46,653
A darn sight more than
he was worth in life, right?

1100
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:49,024
[laughs]

1101
00:54:49,090 --> 00:54:51,860
What about these
bed-curtains, Joe?

1102
00:54:51,926 --> 00:54:54,729
You didn't take them down,
rings and all

1103
00:54:54,796 --> 00:54:57,064
with him lying there, did you?

1104
00:54:57,131 --> 00:54:58,466
I sure did.

1105
00:54:58,533 --> 00:55:00,835
[clicks tongue]
Got his blanket as well.

1106
00:55:00,902 --> 00:55:02,603
He won't need them
to keep him warm

1107
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:05,039
where he's going, I daresay.

1108
00:55:05,105 --> 00:55:07,675
[laughing]

1109
00:55:07,675 --> 00:55:10,110
He didn't have
no friends in life

1110
00:55:10,177 --> 00:55:13,280
'but we'll look after
him in death.'

1111
00:55:13,347 --> 00:55:15,516
[laughing]

1112
00:55:15,583 --> 00:55:17,085
I see, spirit.

1113
00:55:17,152 --> 00:55:20,454
The case of this unhappy man
might be my own.

1114
00:55:20,521 --> 00:55:23,091
My life is already turning
in that direction.

1115
00:55:23,158 --> 00:55:28,158
Can you show me no tenderness
connected with the death?

1116
00:55:33,367 --> 00:55:35,636
Your father's late again,
Martha.

1117
00:55:35,703 --> 00:55:38,740
I think he's walking a little
slower than he used to.

1118
00:55:38,806 --> 00:55:41,475
When he walked with Tiny Tim
upon his shoulders

1119
00:55:41,542 --> 00:55:45,914
'he walked very fast, indeed.'

1120
00:55:45,914 --> 00:55:47,548
He was very light to carry

1121
00:55:47,615 --> 00:55:50,984
and your father loved him,
so that it was no trouble.

1122
00:55:51,051 --> 00:55:54,722
[crying]
No trouble at all.

1123
00:55:54,722 --> 00:55:56,358
I wish you could have gone,
dear.

1124
00:55:56,425 --> 00:55:59,360
It'd have done you good to see
what a pretty place it is.

1125
00:55:59,427 --> 00:56:00,929
But you'll see it.

1126
00:56:00,995 --> 00:56:04,999
I promised him that
I'd walk there on Sundays.

1127
00:56:05,066 --> 00:56:07,535
[sobbing]
Oh, poor Tiny Tim.

1128
00:56:07,602 --> 00:56:10,404
My poor little child.

1129
00:56:10,471 --> 00:56:12,206
[crying]

1130
00:56:12,273 --> 00:56:15,242
None of us
shall ever forget Tiny Tim.

1131
00:56:15,309 --> 00:56:17,545
How patient and sweet he was

1132
00:56:17,612 --> 00:56:22,349
even though he was a little,
little child.

1133
00:56:22,349 --> 00:56:27,154
Not Tiny Tim.

1134
00:56:27,154 --> 00:56:29,823
[intense music]

1135
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:32,693
No!

1136
00:56:32,693 --> 00:56:37,693
So this is what
you wanted me to see.

1137
00:56:37,764 --> 00:56:38,800
[gasps]

1138
00:56:38,867 --> 00:56:40,501
'Is that the grave of the man'

1139
00:56:40,568 --> 00:56:42,871
whom no one mourns?

1140
00:56:42,937 --> 00:56:45,807
No! Answer me
one question, spirit.

1141
00:56:45,874 --> 00:56:48,843
Are these the shadows
of things that will be

1142
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:51,012
or only of what may be?

1143
00:56:51,079 --> 00:56:54,682
No! No, I mean, if a man
were to change his life

1144
00:56:54,749 --> 00:56:56,951
his life's journey
could also change.

1145
00:56:57,018 --> 00:56:59,853
Oh, please, spirit,
say it's so.

1146
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:00,670
Yaah!

1147
00:57:05,593 --> 00:57:07,695
N-no, no, spirit,
no, no, no, hear me.

1148
00:57:07,762 --> 00:57:09,064
I am not the man I was.

1149
00:57:09,130 --> 00:57:10,999
I will not be the man
I would have been

1150
00:57:11,066 --> 00:57:13,634
were it not for you
and your fellow spirits.

1151
00:57:13,701 --> 00:57:16,237
Why show me this
if I'm past all hope?

1152
00:57:16,303 --> 00:57:17,906
Take pity, good spirit.

1153
00:57:17,972 --> 00:57:21,108
Assure me that I may change
these shadows you have shown me

1154
00:57:21,175 --> 00:57:22,976
by an altered life.

1155
00:57:23,043 --> 00:57:24,712
Iwill change!

1156
00:57:24,779 --> 00:57:26,915
I will honor Christmas
in my heart

1157
00:57:26,981 --> 00:57:29,250
and try to keep it all the year.

1158
00:57:29,316 --> 00:57:31,019
The spirits of past

1159
00:57:31,086 --> 00:57:34,221
present and future
shall live within me.

1160
00:57:34,288 --> 00:57:36,424
Oh, I will not forget the lesson

1161
00:57:36,490 --> 00:57:41,061
they have so generously taught!

1162
00:57:41,061 --> 00:57:42,830
I am not the man I was.

1163
00:57:42,897 --> 00:57:44,498
I am not the man I..

1164
00:57:44,565 --> 00:57:48,103
Hey, I'm alive, I'm still alive.

1165
00:57:48,169 --> 00:57:52,240
They're not torn down,
they're here, I'm here.

1166
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:54,174
The shadows of the things
that would have been

1167
00:57:54,241 --> 00:57:55,276
may be dispelled.

1168
00:57:55,342 --> 00:57:57,613
They will be,
oh, I know they will.

1169
00:57:57,679 --> 00:58:02,083
[chuckles]
There's the chair where the
ghost of Christmas present sat.

1170
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:04,251
And there's the window
where Marbley's ghost

1171
00:58:04,318 --> 00:58:06,220
joined the wandering spirits.

1172
00:58:06,287 --> 00:58:08,557
It all happened, it's all true.

1173
00:58:08,624 --> 00:58:12,126
Oh, I'm light as a feather,
I'm as happy as an angel.

1174
00:58:12,192 --> 00:58:14,629
A Merry Christmas to everybody!

1175
00:58:14,695 --> 00:58:16,864
'Happy New Year to the world!'

1176
00:58:16,931 --> 00:58:20,234
Heaven and Christmas time
be praised.

1177
00:58:20,301 --> 00:58:22,137
Thank you, Jacob Marbley.

1178
00:58:22,203 --> 00:58:27,203
Thank you.
On my knees. Thank you.

1179
00:58:28,342 --> 00:58:30,078
[grunts]

1180
00:58:30,145 --> 00:58:32,879
'You, there. Boy. Tell me...'

1181
00:58:32,946 --> 00:58:35,882
[grunts]

1182
00:58:35,882 --> 00:58:37,785
[laughs]

1183
00:58:37,852 --> 00:58:40,088
I suppose I had that coming.

1184
00:58:40,155 --> 00:58:43,557
- No, wait, kid.
- Uh-oh. Mean old skinflint!

1185
00:58:43,624 --> 00:58:46,328
I've already shoveled
your blooming sidewalk!

1186
00:58:46,394 --> 00:58:50,531
[chuckles]
Yes, and you did
a wonderful job!

1187
00:58:50,598 --> 00:58:53,234
Now you can do another.
What's today?

1188
00:58:53,301 --> 00:58:58,301
Today? What do you think?
It's Christmas Day!

1189
00:58:59,273 --> 00:59:00,740
Yabba-dabba..

1190
00:59:00,807 --> 00:59:02,944
Ow!

1191
00:59:03,011 --> 00:59:05,180
It's Christmas Day.
I haven't missed it.

1192
00:59:05,246 --> 00:59:08,816
The spirits have done it all
in one night. And why not?

1193
00:59:08,883 --> 00:59:11,919
They can do anything they want.

1194
00:59:11,986 --> 00:59:15,623
Whoa, he's not only cheap,
he's crazy as a cootasaurus.

1195
00:59:15,690 --> 00:59:17,558
Wait!
Does the poultry shop still

1196
00:59:17,625 --> 00:59:20,161
have that prize turkeysaurus
in the window?

1197
00:59:20,228 --> 00:59:23,497
- The one as big as me?
- That's the one. Buy it.

1198
00:59:23,564 --> 00:59:26,467
And have the poultry man
bring it back here.

1199
00:59:26,534 --> 00:59:29,170
'And here's something
for your trouble.'

1200
00:59:29,237 --> 00:59:32,374
- On me way, guv.
- Heh-he-he..

1201
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:35,276
I'll send that turkeysaurus
over to Bob Cragit's.

1202
00:59:35,343 --> 00:59:37,545
And I shan't tell them
who sent it either.

1203
00:59:37,611 --> 00:59:39,513
[chuckles]

1204
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:44,580
No more measly dinners
for that family.

1205
00:59:46,488 --> 00:59:49,557
Thanks for being so prompt,
my good fellow.

1206
00:59:49,623 --> 00:59:51,759
[coin clinks]

1207
00:59:51,826 --> 00:59:54,762
Off to Bob Cragit's house
with that and mind you

1208
00:59:54,829 --> 00:59:56,764
no telling who sent it!

1209
00:59:56,831 --> 00:59:58,432
[humming]

1210
00:59:58,499 --> 00:59:59,500
wham

1211
00:59:59,567 --> 01:00:01,469
Excuse me, gentle.. Heh?

1212
01:00:01,535 --> 01:00:04,139
Wilma? Uh, Belle?
What are you doing here?

1213
01:00:04,205 --> 01:00:05,907
I'm a card-carrying member

1214
01:00:05,974 --> 01:00:08,876
of the Piltdown
Charitable Foundation.

1215
01:00:08,943 --> 01:00:10,412
What happened to the other guy?

1216
01:00:10,479 --> 01:00:12,914
He's a little under the weather
this morning.

1217
01:00:12,981 --> 01:00:15,516
[man groaning]

1218
01:00:15,583 --> 01:00:17,919
Now, if you'll excuse me,
Mr. Scrooge

1219
01:00:17,986 --> 01:00:19,720
we have nothing further
to discuss.

1220
01:00:19,787 --> 01:00:21,323
Nothing to discuss?

1221
01:00:21,389 --> 01:00:24,892
But we haven't spoken to each
other.. It seems like years.

1222
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:27,728
I'm a changed man,
Wil..uh, Belle.

1223
01:00:27,795 --> 01:00:29,563
Of course you're a changed man.

1224
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:32,033
It's in the script...Scrooge.

1225
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:34,802
None of this is in my script.

1226
01:00:34,869 --> 01:00:37,371
Oh, I know I've been a selfish,
self-centered boob

1227
01:00:37,438 --> 01:00:39,140
but I've changed.

1228
01:00:39,207 --> 01:00:43,978
- Really, Wilma.
- They're making it all up!

1229
01:00:43,978 --> 01:00:46,414
Look, I want to start giving
instead of taking.

1230
01:00:46,481 --> 01:00:48,649
And I'd like to start
with a little something

1231
01:00:48,716 --> 01:00:51,186
for the Piltdown
Charitable Foundation.

1232
01:00:51,252 --> 01:00:54,722
Thank you for your generosity,
Mr. Scrooge. Merry Christmas.

1233
01:00:54,789 --> 01:00:57,025
But...Belle, wait.

1234
01:00:57,091 --> 01:01:00,195
Can't we talk about it
over Christmas dinner?

1235
01:01:00,261 --> 01:01:02,897
I'm going to my nephew's.
Would you care to join me?

1236
01:01:02,964 --> 01:01:07,135
Is he, uh, anything like you,
Mr. Scrooge?

1237
01:01:07,202 --> 01:01:10,971
More like the man I used to be,
and hope to be again.

1238
01:01:11,038 --> 01:01:15,509
[chuckles]

1239
01:01:15,509 --> 01:01:16,644
[knocking on door]

1240
01:01:16,711 --> 01:01:19,411
Who could that be?

1241
01:01:22,115 --> 01:01:23,116

1246
01:01:34,328 --> 01:01:36,797
- Surprise!
- Uncle Scrooge?

1247
01:01:36,864 --> 01:01:38,866
Yes, it's me.

1248
01:01:38,933 --> 01:01:41,802
I've come for Christmas dinner
and brought a friend.

1249
01:01:41,869 --> 01:01:44,638
That is, if you and your lovely
wife will have us.

1250
01:01:44,705 --> 01:01:46,640
[stammers]

1251
01:01:46,707 --> 01:01:50,544
With all my heart, uncle.

1252
01:01:50,544 --> 01:01:52,880
So, you're the infamous
Uncle Scrooge.

1253
01:01:52,947 --> 01:01:57,252
- It's a miracle.
- You got that right.

1254
01:01:57,252 --> 01:01:58,986
Why, you don't seem mean at all.

1255
01:01:59,053 --> 01:02:00,888
[chuckles]

1256
01:02:00,955 --> 01:02:02,656
[ticking]

1257
01:02:02,723 --> 01:02:07,160
[growling]
That Cragit.

1258
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:09,097
[grunts]
Uh-oh.

1259
01:02:09,163 --> 01:02:10,664
You're late, Cragit.

1260
01:02:10,731 --> 01:02:13,034
Uh, I-I am behind
my-my time, sir.

1261
01:02:13,101 --> 01:02:16,137
I-I was making rather
m-merry yesterday.

1262
01:02:16,204 --> 01:02:18,540
But it's only
once a year, s-sir.

1263
01:02:18,607 --> 01:02:22,043
Huh? I tell you,
I won't stand for it, Cragit!

1264
01:02:22,110 --> 01:02:24,177
You, y-you won't, sir?

1265
01:02:24,244 --> 01:02:25,880
Absolutely not.

1266
01:02:25,947 --> 01:02:29,316
From now on, you should be merry
the whole year.

1267
01:02:29,383 --> 01:02:30,883
[chuckles]

1268
01:02:34,822 --> 01:02:37,391
- Well, what do you think, guv?
- Perfect.

01:02:37,458 --> 01:02:40,161
[babbling]

1270
01:02:40,228 --> 01:02:44,732
Well, don't just stand there.
What do you think...partner?

1271
01:02:44,799 --> 01:02:48,369
- Partner, me?
- If you'll have me, Bob.

1272
01:02:48,436 --> 01:02:51,072
There are a great many
back payments in my offer.

1273
01:02:51,139 --> 01:02:54,142
- I assure you.
- Uh, sounds pretty good.

1274
01:02:54,208 --> 01:02:57,344
But, uh, how about
"Cragit & Scrooge?"

1275
01:02:57,411 --> 01:02:59,246
[chuckling]

1276
01:02:59,313 --> 01:03:03,251
Fine with me.

1279
01:03:29,309 --> 01:03:31,913
Da-da.

1280
01:03:31,913 --> 01:03:33,714
All done, guv.

1281
01:03:33,781 --> 01:03:36,617
Huh?

1282
01:03:36,617 --> 01:03:39,087
Done? Oh, no, my friend.

1283
01:03:39,153 --> 01:03:40,454
This is just the beginning.

1284
01:03:40,521 --> 01:03:43,824
From now on, I, Ebenezer Scrooge

1285
01:03:43,891 --> 01:03:45,393
will always be there

1286
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:48,529
to help those
less fortunate than myself.

1287
01:03:48,596 --> 01:03:49,663
Blimey.

1288
01:03:49,730 --> 01:03:51,732
And not just at Christmas

1289
01:03:51,799 --> 01:03:53,768
but all year long.

1290
01:03:53,834 --> 01:03:57,071
"Scrooge was better
than his word.

Hey! What was that for?

1309
01:04:53,728 --> 01:04:56,998
(in unison)
For being such a scrooge!

1310
01:04:57,064 --> 01:04:59,367
But, Wilma,
I'm not a scrooge anymore.

1311
01:04:59,434 --> 01:05:01,703
I understand
what's really important.

[Pebbles screeching]
You and Pebbles
and Barney and Betty.

1313
01:05:04,105 --> 01:05:07,575
- Aw, Fred.
- "Aw, Fred," nothing.

1314
01:05:07,642 --> 01:05:09,444
Where exactly
did this sudden burst

1315
01:05:09,511 --> 01:05:12,079
of Christmas spirit come from?

1316
01:05:12,146 --> 01:05:14,983
Well, there were these
three ghosts.

1317
01:05:15,050 --> 01:05:18,186
Maybe we really could talk
about it over Christmas dinner?

1318
01:05:18,252 --> 01:05:21,755
Just you and me and Pebbles
and, and your mother, too.

1319
01:05:21,822 --> 01:05:22,957
Da-da.

1320

Wow!

Hey, listen to that applause

1324
01:05:31,332 --> 01:05:32,666
they really loved me.

1325
01:05:32,733 --> 01:05:35,036
- Fred.
- Just kidding, honey.

1326
01:05:35,102 --> 01:05:37,004

She's a miracle worker,
alright. She's my wife.

Let's hear it for her.
Yabba-dabba-doo!

- But what happened to Philo?
- The Bedrock Bug.

Great show, Wilma.
Not bad, Fred.

Very funny, Betty.

1349

Uh, come on, Betty.
We gotta get home.

Oh, alright,
you can have the bouquet.

Well, it's not that, Wilma.

I, uh.. You see.. It's just..

1358
01:07:29,218 --> 01:07:32,721
Guv, uh-uh, Mr. Flintstone,
I got these wrapped for you.

1359
01:07:32,787 --> 01:07:34,022
Uh, when you didn't
come back to get them

1360
01:07:34,089 --> 01:07:35,990
I-I thought I'd better
bring them to the theater.

1361
01:07:36,057 --> 01:07:38,659
Oh, you saved my skin, kid.

1362
01:07:38,726 --> 01:07:39,994
I owe you a big tip.

Come on, gang.
Let's go home and celebr..
