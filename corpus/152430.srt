1
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,300
You may now kiss the bride.

2
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:34,100
From now on,
he'll take care of you...

3
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,150
and you'll take care of him.

4
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,550
He'll make you
big baloney sandwiches...

5
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:41,500
and you'll buy him new socks
and a white briefcase.

6
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:45,050
And you'll live happily ever after.

7
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,650
You're the luckiest girl
in the world, Barbie.

8
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,150
The luckiest girl in the world.

9
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,500
You are the luckiest girl
in the world.

10
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,250
When I did Whitney Houston's wedding,
she was even more nervous than you.

11
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,700
And you look ten times better
than she did.

12
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,200
No, I don't.

13
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,850
This isn't gonna work.

14
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,450
I'm fat!

15
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,100
And I'm gonna marry
the wrong guy.

16
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,650
Look at me.

17
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:12,450
You are exquisite.

18
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,850
You're timeless.

19
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,150
You're the envy of your
future sister-in-law Janice...

20
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,650
whom I overheard say at the last
gown fitting, "Look at those thighs.

21
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,450
I'd kill for Tracy's thighs."

22
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,250
But you have more
than great thighs.

23
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,900
You have the love
of a man named Tom.

24
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:37,050
A man who, when he walked into
rehearsal dinner the other day...

25
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:41,300
said, "I can't believe
she picked me.

26
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:45,350
I can't believe I'm marrying the
most beautiful woman I've ever seen."

27
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,100
That tells me that this marriage
of yours is not only gonna work...

28
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,700
it's gonna last forever.

29
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,450
Thank you.

30
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,400
Oh, Mom, come here.

31
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,700
Excuse me.

32
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,400
Hey, what are you doing?

33
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,200
Thank you!

34
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,250
Keep to areas A, B and E. I don't want
any interference with the video team.

35
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:31,050
I know who you're looking for.
They're right downstairs.

36
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,900
- Father, where are you going?
- Nature calls.

37
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,300
You must call back later.
We're about to start.

38
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,300
Let's go. Inside.

39
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,900
Good morning.

40
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,100
Penny, stop flirting.
We're going in one.

41
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:14,700
Penny, go to M-12.
We have a dark Tower choking the AV.

42
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,300
Hi, ma'am. You're in
the preferred seating list.

43
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,900
- If you'll just follow me.
- Bye.

44
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,950
There we go.

45
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:27,850
Enjoy the wedding
from way back here.

46
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,600
Dark Tower demolished.

47
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,700
All right.
Places, everyone.

48
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,600
Todd, cut the fill lights.

49
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,800
Maestro, on three.

50
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,300
Excuse me, Mary. We can't find
the father of the bride.

51
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,400
That's okay. I got it.
Penny, send over the FOB.

52
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,200
I did, 15 minutes ago.

53
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:50,800
Cover me up north.
The FOB is MIA.

54
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:56,150
Oh, no, no, no.
Count to 100 and start again, okay?

55
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,900
Father, you're gonna
have to hold it.

56
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,350
Good.

57
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,850
Hey, guys, we're on.
Tom, come on. Put your jackets on.

58
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,600
Hickory, dickory, dock.
The mouse ran up the clock.

59
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,150
I have a 20 on the FOB.

60
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,600
My little girl's
getting married today.

61
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,450
I remember her graduation
from nursery school...

62
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:53,000
when she was a little girl.

63
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,000
I remember...

64
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,850
like it was yesterday.

65
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,600
- Who are you?
- I'm the wedding planner.

66
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:23,100
Look, there's the wedding planner.

67
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,450
She must lead
such a romantic life.

68
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:15,450
"Earwax."

69
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:18,800
"X" on a double letter.
"A" on a triple word.

70
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,750
Seventy-two points.

71
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,400
No, I challenge you.
"Earwax" is two words.

72
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,850
- It's one.
- You're bluffing.

73
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,500
"Munch." Sixteen points.

74
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,850
Sixteen.

75
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:32,700
Maria, I know I'm a big pain in the neck.
I just want you to be happy.

76
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,900
And I'm gonna say something that you
may be a little resistant to...

77
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,600
but sometimes a father
has to take action.

78
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,600
What are you talking about?

79
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,400
I found you a man
who has agreed to marry you.

80
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:47,600
Oh, my God!

81
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:49,650
If her mother was alive...

82
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,100
and she heard that,
she'd wish she was dead.

83
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,950
"Shaft." Twenty-two points.

84
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,250
Anyway, you know him.
Remember Massimo?

85
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,700
No. Who?

86
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:04,000
Massimo Lenzetta, the little boy you
played with the summer we spent in Italy?

87
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,200
- The kid who ate mud?
- Ya! That's the one!

88
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:12,350
I bumped into him on New Arrivals Night
at the Sicilian Association.

89
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,200
Why, this is the most
wonderful day of my life!

90
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,300
A man of my very own!

91
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,400
- You must bring me to him at once.
- No need.

92
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,100
- He's here?
- Yeah.

93
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:27,900
- He's here? He's here?
- Massimo.

94
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:33,400
- No, he didn't.
- Oh, my God.

95
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:38,750
Oh, my God.

96
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,100
You remember Massimo?

97
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:49,200
That mud did him good.

98
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,650
The last time I see you,
you were scrawny and ugly...

99
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,900
and your head was too big
for your body.

100
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,550
How nice. Thank you.

101
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:58,950
Prego. You're welcome.

102
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,000
I look forward
to our life together.

103
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,550
I want three sons
and a garden of tomatoes.

104
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,800
Okay then.

105
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,650
Tomatoes? Tomatoes?

106
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,500
Ma-Ma- Maria, wait.

107
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:30,450
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

108
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,350
The paper, and I'm gonna take
that Yahoo too.

109
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:35,600
4.50.

110
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:37,000
- Keep it.
- Thanks.

111
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:39,000
- See ya.
- Bye.

112
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,650
- You look all excited.
- I am.

113
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,100
- Mary, I need--
- Can you take it, please?

114
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:03,100
Francine Donolly.

115
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:06,750
Her family started selling gourmet sausages
out of their small working-class kitchen.

116
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:09,300
- Yeah?
- Now today, five years later...

117
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,300
they're one of the biggest Internet
food specialty companies in America.

118
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,050
Pierre, I love you, but if you use
another carnation in my bouquet...

119
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,800
I will deport you.

120
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,600
- Thank you so much.
- Geri.

121
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,450
They put her wedding announcement
in the society pages. Why?

122
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,450
Because they want their new money
to be taken very seriously.

123
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,850
Sheila! Book the Gazebo Package
for the Belettis, okay?

124
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:32,450
Take this ugly flower.

125
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:35,250
Call Davis and tell him we need
a rush order on the chuppa rental.

126
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,750
Thank you.

127
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,300
- What the hell is this?
- Sunless tanning cream.

128
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,750
Wedding's tomorrow.
You do the math.

129
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,050
Stop crying. Quarter cup of lemon juice,
half a cup of salt and a loofah sponge.

130
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,550
- Really?
- Scrub, scrub, scrub. Okay?

131
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,550
Look, they see this
as their ticket into the club.

132
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,600
They wanna make it a social event,
the party everybody talks about.

133
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,300
Oh, thank you, Sheila.

134
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:03,150
I already made contact. They're coming
to the Copeland wedding to see my work.

135
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:07,050
I'm gonna nail this account, Geri.

136
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,850
We'll be in every major
bridal magazine in the country.

137
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:12,550
- It'll be our biggest event ever.
- Good.

138
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:15,650
And when I pull it off,
you're gonna make me a partner.

139
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,800
- A partner?
- Yes.

140
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:21,350
A partner.

141
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:25,250
Okay, you are fantastic.

142
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,300
Really, you're incredible.

143
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,100
Very good work,
but let me tell you something.

144
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,300
I built this business
on my back.

145
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,500
I sweat, I toiled.

146
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:38,500
I did things a little, innocent wedding
planner should never even hear about.

147
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,150
I won't even say it.

148
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,250
I made the big plans, okay?
I made the sacrifices.

149
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,800
You also never made any money.

150
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,050
Wow!

151
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,700
Until I came along.

152
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,250
Look, I've been here
for five years, Geri.

153
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:56,200
I bring in more revenue than all of
your other wedding planners combined.

154
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,050
- That's great.
- Times five!

155
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,350
You need me.

156
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,900
You know you need me.

157
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,700
- I know you know that you need me.
- I don't know that.

158
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,350
You know, maybe I should
just start my own company.

159
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,300
You wouldn't dare.

160
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,250
Of course, if I nailed the Donolly account
and you made me a partner...

161
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:18,550
you'd save me the trouble
of designing my own letterhead.

162
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:22,150
Let me see.
What font would I use?

163
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,600
- You're gonna be a partner!
- I gotta get the account first.

164
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,700
Please, Mary, you're totally
gonna get the account.

165
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,250
The Greenburg marriage lasted one year,
two months. You win the pot again.

166
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,350
How do you do it?
I was more than four years off.

167
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,900
"I Honestly Love You" by Olivia
Newton-John was their wedding song.

168
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,900
Puts them in
the 14-month divorce range.

169
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,400
Speaking of honest love,
Jed was asking about you again.

170
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,600
I don't trust a man
who gets regular pedicures.

171
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:43,900
- Mary, you haven't been on a date in two years.
- Your point?

172
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,950
My point is that
if you're not interested in Jed...

173
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:48,950
there is a handsome Italian man
waiting to marry you in the lobby.

174
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:50,950
Hide me.
Did you talk to him?

175
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:53,000
Just for a few minutes.
He is so adorable.

176
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,350
- He's not adorable.
- How can you say that?

177
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:59,500
When we were kids, he followed me for
a summer asking me if I had a vagina.

178
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,700
I think that's adorable.

179
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,800
I gotta get out of here.

180
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:08,000
- Grab that side.
- You shouldn't hold that against him.

181
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:11,150
You should give him a chance.
He was a little boy.

182
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,450
Maybe he wanted to be a doctor.
Besides, you do have a vagina.

183
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,350
My, this is hard to push
all by myself.

184
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:23,200
May you have enough happiness
to keep you sweet...

185
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,900
enough trials to keep you strong...

186
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:29,450
enough hope to keep you happy...

187
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,800
Enough friends to give you comfort.

188
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,800
enough friends to give you comfort...

189
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,050
- Enough determination...
- and enough determination...

190
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:39,100
- to make each day a better day...
- to make each day...

191
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:41,000
- a better day...
- than yesterday.

192
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:42,650
- than yesterday.
- Raise your glass.

193
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:46,300
Congratulations to you guys.
I love you both.

194
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:52,300
What? You think Kissinger
came up with his own stuff?

195
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:55,850
You just fed the best man
his speech.

196
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,150
Smooth. Real smooth.

197
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,150
You must be Francine.
I saw your article in Yahoo.

198
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:04,150
- It's very impressive.
- Oh, God, I hate that picture.

199
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,400
It made me look
like a psychotic poodle.

200
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,950
My fiance has got to see this.

201
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:16,450
He will just die.

202
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:20,050
- He should be here by now.
- Most grooms are NIDs.

203
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:22,700
"Not Into Details."

204
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,850
That's Eddie, all right.

205
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:27,200
- Oh, come on, I want you to meet my parents.
- Okay.

206
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:30,550
Thanks, doll. That rocked.

207
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:35,600
Mary, meet my parents,
Kitty and Jack.

208
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,750
- How do you do?
- So nice to meet you.

209
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:40,050
- Dad, are you eating the food?
- Mm-hmm.

210
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,000
Champagne is delightful.
Cristal? D.P.?

211
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,050
- Actually, it's Taittinger.
- Exquisite.

212
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:49,100
Mother, we're not guests. You're not
supposed to be drinking the champagne.

213
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:55,400
You give my little girl whatever
she wants, no expense spared.

214
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:58,700
Yes, and I'll be faxing you a list of the songs
I'll be performing at the reception.

215
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,400
And none of those mini egg rolls.
We've got a lot of important people coming.

216
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,550
- We've got an impression to make.
- We haven't hired her yet.

217
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,750
And mother, as previously discussed in detail,
you won't be singing at the wedding.

218
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,900
I'm sorry, Mary. Hi.

219
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:16,600
The belly dancer's here,
and she has a tattoo of an--

220
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,600
It's okay. Penny,
I want you to meet the Donollys.

221
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,100
- This is one of my associates, Penny.
- Pleasure.

222
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,450
What I need you to do is go to the
office and prepare the Murdoch file.

223
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,700
Ooh, Murdoch.

224
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,200
As in--

225
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,450
Discretion.

226
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,700
Oops.

227
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:36,450
The Murdoch files. Right.

228
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,000
All right now, wedding woman.

229
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,050
Let's get down to brass tacks.

230
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,050
What do you see for our wedding?

231
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,550
Well, now, having met you...

232
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:53,150
off the top of my head...

233
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,650
let's see.

234
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,800
Night.

235
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,450
Dubounce Botanical Gardens.

236
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:05,900
White, silk tents
thin enough to see the stars.

237
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,550
Candlelight.

238
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,900
Wedgewood.

239
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,250
Exotic waringin trees
imported from Bali.

240
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,200
I'm thinking Gatsby.

241
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,450
Not a period wedding...

242
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:23,500
but the spirit of it,
the time.

243
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:29,900
I nailed it, Geri.
Yeah, but they want it in three months.

244
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,350
They're going for June.
I know.

245
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:35,050
The clock is ticking.
Put Penny on.

246
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,350
Guess what, Miss Moneypenny?

247
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,450
Hold on, Penny.

248
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,550
This shoe is stuck.

249
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,950
Not my good shoes.

250
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,550
Oh, my goodness.

251
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:11,550
My new Gucci shoe.

252
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:13,800
Come on!

253
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,550
Oh, are you okay?
Are you okay?

254
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,750
I'm great.

255
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:31,150
- Okay.
- Where's my shoe?

256
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,200
Your shoe?
You got it right here.

257
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,900
Now talk to me.
How are you feeling?

258
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:41,300
Are you experiencing any dizziness,
nausea, difficulty breathing?

259
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,700
The breathing thing rings a bell.

260
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,500
Then again, you are on top of me,
cutting off my air supply.

261
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:55,200
Your mental clarity's excellent.
That's good. That's good.

262
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,750
Don't appear to have a concussion.

263
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,750
You took quite a fall.

264
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,750
Why are you still on top of me?

265
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:09,600
That's a good question.

266
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:13,200
You see that dumpster there?
Seems that dumpster tried to kill you.

267
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,400
You were standing in the middle of the
road, and it was coming right at you.

268
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,950
Just take your time.
Sit up straight. You okay?

269
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:22,500
You saved...

270
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,200
my shoe.

271
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:27,900
My life.

272
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,500
Your shoe was what I was going for.
You just turned out to be a bonus.

273
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:35,250
Come on. We're gonna try and get up.
Take your time.

274
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,250
Take your time.

275
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,400
Up.

276
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,050
Here we go.
I got you. I got you.

277
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,600
I got you, okay?

278
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:52,400
You smell like sweet red plums...

279
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,550
and grilled cheese sandwiches.

280
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:01,150
Okay. Here you go.

281
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,400
Aah, my thumb!

282
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,950
Yeah, I get that all the time.
Thank you.

283
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,750
All right. Hold up!
All right.

284
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,750
Yup, she's dead, all right.

285
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,000
- You think she's going to heaven?
- Definitely.

286
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:20,150
She's got the cleanest toes
I've ever seen.

287
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,400
Where am I?

288
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:26,350
You're at the children's ward
of St. Vincent's Hospital.

289
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:29,200
I'm your doctor.
Try not to talk.

290
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:33,900
My God.

291
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,500
I'm paralyzed. I'm paralyzed!

292
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,100
If you're moving your arms and legs,
you're clearly not paralyzed.

293
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:42,350
Boo!

294
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,950
Yes, thank you.
There's my flashlight.

295
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,250
Thank you.
How's our patient doing?

296
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:52,050
- It was touch and go for a while.
- Was it? What do you recommend?

297
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,150
I think she needs more fluids.

298
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:58,200
Why don't you go load her up
with 10 cc's of Yoo-Hoo, all right?

299
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,500
Here we go.

300
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:04,300
- You're the guy--
- Steve Edison.

301
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,500
I'm the supervising
pediatrician here.

302
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:09,900
- Mary--
- Fiore. Yeah, I know.

303
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:12,250
I had to go through your wallet
to get your identification.

304
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:15,000
I must say, I've never met anyone who
alphabetized her credit cards before.

305
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:18,900
Here's the skinny on you.

306
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:22,550
Your X-rays are fine.
Hemoglobin levels are normal.

307
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:26,150
We're just waiting on the CAT scan to
be processed, then we can get you out of here.

308
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,650
You can take this off now.

309
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,250
- Oh, you've got a big neck.
- I have a big neck?

310
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:34,750
Don't get me wrong.
It's a fine neck.

311
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:38,200
It's just that haven't had a patient
over the age of six in three years.

312
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,850
What happened to your hand?

313
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:54,850
My hand. You fell on it
with your big neck.

314
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:34,650
Your CAT scan came back,
and it's all clear.

315
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,700
- So I'm okay?
- You're better than new.

316
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:44,400
Speaking of new, that's a pretty
modern girl you have there.

317
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:46,550
- Who?
- Your girlfriend.

318
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:52,500
No, that's my sister.
I guess you could say she's modern.

319
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,050
The last time I saw her,
she had a spike through her chin.

320
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,150
Oh, my.

321
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,300
What I don't understand
is how she got near the dumpster!

322
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,950
Miss?

323
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,800
- Oh, my God, you're alive!
- How did you find me?

324
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:09,400
I'm so happy! The nurse found my
phone number taped to your Palm Pilot.

325
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,100
She told me what happened, and--

326
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:16,750
Is this the guy who saved you?

327
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:22,150
I wouldn't exactly
call it a rescue.

328
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:24,800
I mean, I was just in the right place
at the right time.

329
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:28,900
Well, aren't you just
the modern-day hero?

330
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,800
Are you okay?

331
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:45,550
Fabulous.

332
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,650
Penny Nicholson.
Nice to meet you.

333
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:51,650
I'm Steve Edison.
It's nice to meet you too.

334
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:54,400
Please, have a seat. Make yourself comfortable.
Mary's gonna be fine.

335
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:59,150
So, you must work long hours.
Are you working late tonight?

336
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:01,400
No, I'm not even on duty tonight.

337
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,800
Great!

338
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:08,050
You know, Mary and I were
gonna go to Golden Gate Park.

339
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:10,650
They show old movies
on the side of the museum.

340
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,600
And... you should come with us.

341
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:16,850
- We won't take no for an answer.
- Penny, will you leave him alone, please?

342
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:19,000
Oh, you don't want me to go?

343
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:22,400
Of course she wants you to go.

344
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:27,550
You know, the truth is, doctor...

345
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,250
that I've-- I've been thinking
about a career in medicine.

346
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:34,550
Something medicinal or whatnot.

347
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:38,050
I'd really like to
just pick a part of your brain.

348
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,150
- Do not leave me here.
- I know what's best for you.

349
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:42,150
I'm gonna get you over this Keith thing
once and for all!

350
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:44,300
It's only been six years.

351
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,350
It's not a date!

352
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,750
Do not leave me alone. Please.

353
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:51,100
- It's for your own good.
- Don't you dare!

354
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,850
- There he is.
- There's your gum ball.

355
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:58,450
Thank you. Oh, good. Boy, you
can never get the colors you want.

356
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,950
Okay, well.

357
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,000
Oh, no!

358
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,600
Darn it. I just remembered
that I-- I promised...

359
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:09,500
my friend's brother's godmother...

360
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:12,400
that I would help her...

361
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,400
change her fax cartridge tonight...

362
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:18,800
because she's going
out of town tomorrow...

363
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,450
on an African safari.

364
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:23,350
I should go do that.

365
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:26,100
I'm really sorry that we're not
gonna be able to have that...

366
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,900
- medical chat.
- Medical chat, yeah.

367
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,400
Okay. Bye.

368
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,250
- Penny.
- Wow.

369
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:38,450
Goodness, I hope her...

370
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,500
friend's brother's godmother
is gonna be okay.

371
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,300
You know,
I have reserved seating.

372
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:48,650
- All right.
- Okay. Let's go.

373
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:53,800
- Thanks for guarding my tree.
- Yes, I'm guarding your tree.

374
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:56,150
There's your blanket right there
under your tree I kept for you.

375
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,400
- Thank you, Burt. This is Steve Edison.
- Steve, how you do? Nice to meet you.

376
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,600
- Pleased to meet you.
- It's about time you had a date.

377
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:04,200
- It's not--
- What line of business are you in?

378
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:06,850
- I'm a doctor at St. Vincent's.
- You a doctor?

379
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:09,500
He's a doctor.
Well, I get the hint.

380
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,200
See you at the Scrabble
practice, kid.

381
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,950
Sorry. I'm so sorry about that.

382
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,200
Scrabble practice?

383
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,200
Please, don't ask.

384
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,350
Come on. You can't
leave me hanging on that.

385
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:27,900
"See you at Scrabble practice, kid"?
What's that?

386
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,350
I'm a member of
the Bay Area Scrabble Club.

387
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,950
- Pathetic, I know.
- Wow.

388
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:35,400
- What?
- That is pathetic.

389
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:37,850
Shut up.

390
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,650
At least I can spell.
What can you do?

391
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:43,400
- I throw a mean yo-yo.
- You know what?

392
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:47,000
- No more caramel corn for you.
- I'm serious.

393
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:50,400
How'd you get into it? I've never met
a member of a Scrabble Club before.

394
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,400
That's for sure.

395
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:57,350
When my parents came over
from Italy...

396
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,450
they joined a Scrabble Club
so they could learn English.

397
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:05,950
And after my mom died, my dad became,
like, obsessed with the game...

398
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,500
and wanted me to play with him
all the time...

399
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,250
so I guess, in a way,
I was destined.

400
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:14,500
C-O-O-L.

401
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,300
What are you doing?

402
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,800
I only eat the brown ones.

403
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:31,300
Because?

404
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,400
'Cause I figure they have
less artificial coloring...

405
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,700
'cause chocolate's already brown.

406
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,000
That's very scientific of you,
dr. Steve.

407
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,250
Thank you, Mary.

408
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:48,150
So where would one go
to see a Scrabble match?

409
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:51,000
Oh, look. It's starting.

410
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:01,800
And closer

411
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:05,450
tome

412
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:13,400
- Oh, that's beautiful.
- You like it?

413
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,950
Yes.

414
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:33,600
This is by far the coolest thing
I've ever done in this city.

415
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:42,050
the closer you are

416
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:46,550
- the brighter the stars glow
- Wanna dance?

417
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:51,350
I don't know. I haven't danced
in quite some time.

418
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,900
- Okay.
- Girl asks you to dance, you dance.

419
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:00,900
Burt's right.
Yes, Mary, I would love to dance.

420
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:05,500
- No pressure.
- It's too late now.

421
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,100
Okay.

422
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:26,400
Where'd you learn
to dance like this?

423
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:28,600
Ballroom class.

424
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,900
Oh, you're gay.

425
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:33,250
Oh, yeah, the gayest.

426
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:42,250
My mother put me
in ballroom classes...

427
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:44,300
when I was eight years old.

428
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:47,900
She wanted me to be Fred Astaire.
I wanted to be Marcus Welby.

429
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:52,250
So now you're
a little bit of both?

430
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,500
I think you're being kind.

431
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:59,400
You can stop that.
I'm gonna blush.

432
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:05,850
How's your thumb?

433
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,700
Never better.

434
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,100
YMCA.

435
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,900
My next Scrabble match
is Saturday...

436
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:38,000
at 1:00 at the north side YMCA.

437
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:40,550
It'll be the social event
of the season.

438
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,350
Maybe you should be there.

439
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:51,750
- Maybe you shouldn't step on my foot.
- Did I?

440
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,350
- Yes.
- I'm sorry.

441
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,550
That's okay.
Just don't let it happen again.

442
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,900
Don't tell me what to do.

443
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:00,350
Don't what?

444
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,600
Holy shit!

445
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:41,100
Are you guys crazy?
This isn't funny!

446
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:44,750
I am thinking teal for the bridesmaids.
What do you think?

447
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,450
Good morning. Earth to Mary.

448
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,000
What is up with you?
You're different.

449
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,600
I'm not different.
How am I different?

450
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,700
You can't stop smiling.

451
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,100
I'm not smiling.
Am I smiling?

452
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,450
Like a fool.

453
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,850
- Tell me.
- It's nothing.

454
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:07,450
Then stop smiling.

455
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:10,250
- I can't.
- Okay, who is he?

456
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,350
Okay. No, no!

457
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,700
Mr. Kotsioupolis, you cannot throw
plates at the Ritz-fucking-Carlton!

458
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,950
It's okay.

459
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:24,800
This is like a fairy tale.

460
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:27,400
He saves your life.
You dance under the stars.

461
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:30,150
- You kiss in the rain.
- Almost kissed.

462
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:34,350
I don't know, Fran. I've been so out
of the whole dating-relationship loop.

463
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:35,750
You?

464
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:40,000
You know, those who can't do, teach?
Those who can't wed, plan.

465
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:43,000
With my help, you could marry
this man in three months.

466
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:47,150
I have totally lost control.
Will you please, please, please help me?

467
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:49,100
Penny, if you can't beat 'em--

468
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:52,950
- What has gotten into you?
- She met a guy.

469
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:55,850
You met a guy? You mean--

470
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:04,350
- I wanna hear all about it!
- I owe you one, Penny.

471
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,500
You do. You owe me one!

472
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:11,650
- Hello, Rene. How are you?
- Great.

473
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:14,200
Listen, they're gonna be
signing up for six classes.

474
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:16,950
So just be sure
to pay up front, okay?

475
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:19,200
Basil himself
is gonna be here today.

476
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:21,200
- Really?
- Yes.

477
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,700
I'll have to call you back.
Okay. Bye.

478
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,350
Mary, what are you doing here?

479
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:31,800
Oh, my God.
I'm so embarrassed.

480
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,800
I may be a hell
of a businesswoman...

481
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:36,800
but when I dance,
I look like a retarded string bean.

482
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,900
I thought your class
wasn't till Thursday though.

483
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,700
I know. We had to change it.
But this is perfect.

484
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:45,100
You can finally meet Eddie.
Come here. Eddie.

485
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,150
Eddie, come here.

486
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,250
I want you to meet
the wedding planner.

487
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:52,000
The two most important people
in my life set eyes on one another.

488
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:54,500
Eddie, this is Mary,
the wedding planner.

489
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,200
Mary, this is my fiance Eddie.

490
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:14,050
- Mary, are you okay?
- Uh-huh. Yup. Good.

491
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:18,350
Let's see who that is.

492
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:23,050
Hi, dad. Wait.

493
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,900
I can't hear you. Hang on.
All right. Okay, I got you.

494
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:29,650
Okay, I'm losing you again.
I'm sorry.

495
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:33,050
Shoot. Okay, wait, wait.
Hello. Do you hear me?

496
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:36,250
Quickly, people.
Get your tootsies out here, pronto.

497
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:39,350
Welcome to the Basil St. Mosely
School of dance.

498
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,850
I am Basil St. Mosely.

499
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:44,600
Hang on. I can't hear you.
Wait a second. I can't hear you.

500
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,900
You're breaking up. Hang on.

501
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:48,400
There you go.

502
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:52,050
I'd like all my lovely couples,
dancing partners, paired up in twos...

503
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:54,300
ready to dance, not next week,
not tomorrow, but now.

504
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:56,300
- Dance with Eddie.
- I can't.

505
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:58,600
Quickly.
Is there a problem in the room?

506
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:01,800
Pronto, people. I'd like us to still
be young when this class is over.

507
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,450
I have to take this call.

508
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,800
Darling, I understand you're busy.
I'm busy too.

509
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:08,000
- You're holding up the class.
- She's with him.

510
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,350
All right.

511
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,600
Mary, watch out for his thumb.
He hurt it saving some old lady.

512
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:15,200
- Sorry, I can't.
- Listen, I got a prior engagement.

513
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,250
Interesting choice of words.

514
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,550
Wallflowers,
it's time to blossom and bloom.

515
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:23,300
Obviously, what we have here, people,
is a fear of dancing.

516
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:27,100
It's my firm belief
we must conquer one's fears.

517
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,350
Now, I have to gauge
what I am dealing with...

518
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:33,100
so I will play music,
you will dance...

519
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:34,900
and I will observe.

520
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,050
Okay, Rene?

521
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:38,050
Yes, thank you.

522
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:42,050
Mary, would you like to dance?

523
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,350
Have no fear. Dance. Dance.

524
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,100
Yes.

525
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:52,050
- Old lady, huh?
- Listen, this is--

526
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,400
- You told me your name was Steve.
- It is Steve.

527
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:57,050
My last name is Edison.
Fran calls me Eddie. It's a nickname.

528
00:35:57,150 --> 00:36:00,500
I have a better nickname for you.
How about common, cheating, sleazy--

529
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,700
If you're thinking--

530
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:04,450
What I'm thinking involves
a machete and a pair of pliers.

531
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,600
Okay.

532
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,550
- The day that you had the accident.
- That was a special day.

533
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:13,950
It was. I was running late.

534
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,650
How convenient.

535
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:19,050
I was meeting Fran and our wedding
planner, which you turned out to be.

536
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:21,050
What are the odds?

537
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:23,250
Dance. Dance!

538
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:29,250
Don't dance around the issue. You didn't
show 'cause you don't wanna get married.

539
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:32,300
- I see it all the time.
- You see what?

540
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,400
Why'd you tell your fiancee
you saved an old lady?

541
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,400
Exactly!

542
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:40,300
You think you want to get married,
but you don't.

543
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:43,800
You're pitiful and confused, looking
to get some hot pepper wherever you can.

544
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:46,450
Mary, you have no idea
what you're talking about.

545
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:47,700
Yeah?

546
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:49,350
Why did you go
to the movies with me?

547
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:52,100
Why did Steve go to the movies
with you? Let's see.

548
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,500
First of all,
Steve likes the movies.

549
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,200
Steve had the night off.

550
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:58,350
Steve said, "Hey, you know what?

551
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:01,400
A movie sounds good."
Plus he got an invitation.

552
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:03,650
Why is Steve referring to himself
in the third person?

553
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:05,650
What are you talking about?

554
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:09,400
Think you can double-talk your way out,
throw me off your scent? I smell you!

555
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:12,100
And I smell like sweet red plums
and grilled cheese sandwiches.

556
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,600
- What?
- Yes.

557
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:16,200
- So you said before you passed out.
- I did not!

558
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:19,250
You did too. If anybody was
looking to get some, it's M-A-R-Y.

559
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:20,950
You are hideous.

560
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:23,450
Okay. Then why'd you
ask me to dance?

561
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,950
- I didn't.
- You did too.

562
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,350
- I did not.
- You said, "Steve, would you like to dance?"

563
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:31,250
And even if I did,
I'm not the one who's engaged.

564
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,250
It was a dance.

565
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,400
Whoop-dee-doo.
It didn't mean anything.

566
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:38,200
Then why'd you almost kiss me?

567
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:43,700
This pair, this lovely couple...

568
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,450
they have it,
they know what it takes.

569
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,100
Very well done.

570
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,800
We need to powwow.

571
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:58,650
As soon as dad mentioned it,
I went, "Of course."

572
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:01,700
Everybody knows that
it's the place to get married.

573
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:04,450
Sure, Fran.
A vineyard sounds perfect.

574
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:06,800
- We should check it out right away.
- I already have.

575
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:11,050
We have reservations for this weekend,
but you'll have to take off Friday.

576
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:15,000
Friday? Friday's not good for me.
I have a diverticulitis seminar planned.

577
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:18,300
- Okay. Saturday.
- Saturday.

578
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,350
Saturday. All right, Mary?
Thanks for everything.

579
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,850
Nice to meet you. Thanks for the dance.
We'll let you know how it all goes.

580
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:27,200
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Wait a second. She's coming with us.

581
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:28,850
- I'm coming?
- She's comin'?

582
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:29,850
Yes.

583
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:32,000
You are not quitting
the Donolly wedding!

584
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,800
I gotta tell Geri
I'm off the account.

585
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:38,050
Hold on.

586
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:39,750
Listen...

587
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:44,250
There's only one good reason to quit a wedding
and that's if you break the cardinal rule...

588
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:47,900
which is ridiculous because we both know
you did not fall in love with the groom.

589
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:50,000
What?

590
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:53,700
You didn't.

591
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,150
Bad.

592
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:59,200
No, of course not.

593
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:03,350
I'd never get emotionally involved.

594
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:05,550
Never. Never.

595
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:08,050
It's the doctor.

596
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:12,650
I'm confused. Is it the doctor,
or did you fall for the groom?

597
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:16,600
No, the doctor is the groom.
The groom is the doctor.

598
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,150
The doctor is Fran Donolly's fiance!

599
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:21,550
The dumpster girl
is your wedding planner?

600
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,550
Yes. I'm in hell.

601
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:25,700
And I'm in heaven.
Now you can fix me up with her.

602
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:29,050
I'm not fixing you up, Dr. John.
Look, this is complicated enough.

603
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:32,150
You are one of the top
wedding planners...

604
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:36,150
in this great, big,
thriving metropolis.

605
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:39,200
Look on the positive side.
He got you to open up again.

606
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:41,250
Thank the bastard and move on.

607
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:44,400
You cannot tell me you would sacrifice
your entire career over this!

608
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:48,050
You're not telling me that you think
it's a mistake to marry Fran now?

609
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,950
I don't think it's a mistake
to marry Fran. Fran is great.

610
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:52,800
Yes.

611
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:56,150
It's just that...

612
00:39:58,350 --> 00:40:01,250
what if what I think is great
really is great...

613
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:06,550
but it's not as great
as something greater?

614
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:09,700
You will go through
with this wedding!

615
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,100
Why?

616
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,100
Because you deserve this partnership.
You've earned it!

617
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,200
- You're right.
- Of course I'm right.

618
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:18,750
Of course you're right.

619
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:21,750
Your feelings for her,
that's not chemistry, that's anxiety.

620
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,350
- It's nature.
- It's natural.

621
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:27,800
Natural. It's not chemistry,
it's anxiety.

622
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:30,100
I can do this.
I can plan this wedding.

623
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,550
And the feelings that I have for Fran
run deep.

624
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:35,500
It's not something that can be swept
away in one night with one dance.

625
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,450
Not gonna happen.

626
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:39,450
- What the hell was I thinking?
- You were thinking wrong.

627
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:42,450
I was thinking wrong.
I was being a jackass. Come on, Steve.

628
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:46,150
I can treat that jackass
like any other faceless groom.

629
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,400
That's just what I'm gonna do.
Why?

630
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,750
Because he's nothing!
Because I love a challenge!

631
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,200
And because I am
a goddamn professional!

632
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:59,350
- So you're gonna give me her number?
- No, I'm not.

633
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,300
I thought that we had
everything covered...

634
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:11,350
but then I realized Eddie and I
don't have a wedding song.

635
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:15,400
So I got this wedding compilation
to see if we can find one.

636
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,350
Okay, here we go.

637
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:26,850
- What do you think?
- That's groovy.

638
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:29,900
- I like it.
- Let's see what else there is.

639
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:34,500
# You fill up my senses #

640
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:39,050
- What do you think of this one?
- That's groovy too. I like it.

641
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:40,400
It's kinda cute.

642
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,750
Kinda not.

643
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,550
# I love you #

644
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:48,950
Oh, my God.

645
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:51,650
Olivia Newton-John.
I love this song.

646
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:54,300
# I honestly love you #
- Oh, this is perfect, isn't it?

647
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:56,850
Yes, it is perfect.

648
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:58,700
- It is.
- Yes.

649
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,850
What?

650
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:03,550
Nothing. It's nothing.

651
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:07,650
- What, is it a bad song?
- No, I think it's absolutely perfect.

652
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,700
- See? It's perfect.
- It's perfect?

653
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,750
Yes, it is.
It's perfect.

654
00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:14,350
You think so?
We have a song!

655
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:17,200
I can't believe it.
We have a song.

656
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,100
I love you

657
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,100
I honestly love you

658
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,100
What's that, like, 1983?

659
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,400
Oh, Mary, I've been meaning to ask you,
speaking of LoVe...

660
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,400
what happened to that guy?

661
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,600
You know, the one
that you danced with--

662
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:40,600
- Eddie!
- That was a damn deer in the road. Did you see that?

663
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:43,100
Damn it.

664
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:45,450
Careful.

665
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:50,050
So, what happened?

666
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:54,650
- Didn't work out.
- How is that possible?

667
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:58,300
I saw you three days later,
and you still had stars in your eyes.

668
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:07,500
Well, he turned out to be the groom
of one of the weddings I was planning.

669
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:11,150
Yes.

670
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:13,800
That is the most disgusting thing
I have ever heard.

671
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:18,750
I would hate to be a single gal with all
those creeps running around out there.

672
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,600
Yeah, Fran, you're really lucky.

673
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:25,250
# I love you #

674
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:32,950
# I honestly love you #

675
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:46,650
I suppose they'd like to see the gardens
first. Don't you think, Mary?

676
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:50,250
Over here is where the actual ceremony
would take place.

677
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:51,500
Mary Fiore!

678
00:43:53,350 --> 00:43:55,000
What are you doing here?

679
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:58,350
Well, your papa tell me where you are,
so I come to surprise it to you.

680
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,050
I made this for you.

681
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:03,500
And who is this?

682
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:06,950
- I'm her fiance.
- What?

683
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:08,100
Her fiance?

684
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:12,050
- Buongiorno. I am Massimo.
- I'm Steve.

685
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:13,450
And I'm Fran.

686
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:17,850
Oh, my God, Mary, I cannot believe
you didn't tell us you were engaged.

687
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:19,200
Mary, you're engaged!

688
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:21,250
That's marvelous!

689
00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:25,950
After all the weddings we've done
together, and now finally it's your turn.

690
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,650
- And I am her fiance.
- Congratulations.

691
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:32,500
We're gonna have to plan something
very special this weekend to celebrate.

692
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:36,200
- It won't be necessary.
- Oh yes, it will, because it is wonderful.

693
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:37,750
It is wonderful.

694
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:41,300
I mean you've found that somebody special
in your life...

695
00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:43,300
to be honest and faithful to...

696
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:45,650
until the end of time, forever and ever
no matter what.

697
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,500
You must take that moment, Mary.

698
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:53,350
And I am her fiance.

699
00:44:57,450 --> 00:45:00,800
- Bernard, we're ready for our tour now.
- Certainly. Just follow me.

700
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:02,300
Wow.

701
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:09,200
This wedding putting-together
is not a job for a man.

702
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:12,050
You stay with me
and we will do the manly bonding.

703
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:15,500
Manly bonding.
You and me.

704
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:18,550
We'll let the ladies--
I mean, the brides-to-be--

705
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:21,050
we'll let them go do their thing.

706
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:22,350
Bye-bye, girls.

707
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:27,150
How cute is he?

708
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,300
He's so cute.

709
00:45:29,350 --> 00:45:32,000
How long you known Mary, buddy?

710
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:34,150
Way before she had the breasts.

711
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:38,050
Believe me, back then
she did not look so good.

712
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:42,400
Look. A center
for the physical fitness.

713
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:44,450
We do the bonding.
Follow me.

714
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:46,400
We do the bonding.

715
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:04,800
Take it easy there, buddy.

716
00:46:04,850 --> 00:46:08,000
- I like the speed.
- You like the speed.

717
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,000
Faster.

718
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,500
Run!

719
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:21,950
Run like a man!

720
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:23,450
Like me!

721
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:28,250
Well, here we are.

722
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:33,050
Hi, bunny.
Wedding woman.

723
00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:35,050
Mr. Donolly.
Hello, Mrs. Donolly.

724
00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:37,050
What took you guys so long?

725
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:40,400
We found seven of the most
adorable vineyards on the way up.

726
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,050
- Right by the side of the road.
- All you can drink.

727
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:46,000
- Really? Great.
- Oh, honey, do you mind?

728
00:46:46,850 --> 00:46:49,550
- How many is that for you?
- Sixty-five.

729
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,100
And you?

730
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:53,200
- How many?
- Sixty-five.

731
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,500
Same.

732
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,350
Sixty-seven.

733
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:05,700
And another plus is that their chef is rated
one of the three best on the West Coast.

734
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,950
I really like it, dad.

735
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,500
You know who else was married here?
Lesley Ann Martin.

736
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:13,500
Herb Martin's daughter?
Well, forget it. This place is out.

737
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,500
I'm not following
in Herb Martin's shoddy footsteps.

738
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,700
- I didn't see a stage either.
- Mother!
- Find something bigger.

739
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:21,200
Eddie, what on Earth--

740
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:27,200
What are you doing?

741
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:28,800
Yeah, just a second.

742
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:34,850
Good move, honey.

743
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,950
From this valley

744
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,950
they say you are leavin'

745
00:47:46,050 --> 00:47:47,400
It's "going", honey.

746
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:48,550
Whatever, darling.

747
00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:52,650
I shall miss your bright eyes

748
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:56,000
And sweet smile...
smile smile smile

749
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:01,900
I'm starting a nonprofit pediatric
foundation. I want Eddie to head it up.

750
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,200
Can you imagine that, Eddie CEO
of a major medical foundation?

751
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:07,250
He wants to
give up his patients?

752
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:09,300
He does.
He just doesn't know it yet.

753
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:11,600
He has a hard time
leaving people behind.

754
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:13,600
Always do the right thing.

755
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:18,900
I'm sure he doesn't always
do the right thing.

756
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Just the something something

757
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:25,050
Red River Valley

758
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:27,550
Mom, would you please shut up!

759
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:32,050
Whoa! Heel, boy!
Heel! Heel!

760
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,650
Pull on the reins!

761
00:48:46,850 --> 00:48:48,900
Stop! Oh, God!

762
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,300
Horsey! Horsey! Horsey!

763
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,650
Oh, God.

764
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:57,800
Oh, God.

765
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:05,450
Tree! Tree!

766
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:08,550
Hang on, Mary!

767
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:11,100
I got you! I got you!

768
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:15,650
On the count of three.
One, two, three!

769
00:49:24,050 --> 00:49:25,600
You okay?

770
00:49:42,350 --> 00:49:45,350
Oh, my God.
You could've been killed.

771
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:48,650
- You see it's important to learn how to ride a horse.
- Yeah.

772
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:51,800
- Eddie, you're riding back with Mary.
- No, no, really.

773
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:53,800
Don't let her out of your sight.

774
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:56,900
And the good news is,
I have the wine!

775
00:50:01,350 --> 00:50:03,800
As I walked out on

776
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:07,500
the streets of Laredo

777
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:22,350
- Thank you for what you did.
- No problem.

778
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,400
You don't have to be
all smug about it.

779
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:32,000
How about a quick recap here, Mary?

780
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:34,750
You harpoon me for being engaged...

781
00:50:34,850 --> 00:50:40,700
when, in a zippy and unexpected twist,
you yourself turn out to have a fiance.

782
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:43,400
Now you have the nerve
to call me smug?

783
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:46,300
Come on, Mary.
What the hell is your problem?

784
00:50:46,350 --> 00:50:48,300
You're the one with the problem.

785
00:50:48,350 --> 00:50:50,500
I've been doing this a long time...

786
00:50:50,550 --> 00:50:53,800
and I can predict down to the week
how long a couple's going to last.

787
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:58,050
Are you aware that Fran
has chosen teal for her bridesmaids?

788
00:50:58,050 --> 00:51:00,800
Teal, the color of gangrene.

789
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:05,100
My last bride who chose teal
got her marriage annulled in 12 days.

790
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:09,300
Oh, oh, and "I Honestly Love You"
as your wedding song?

791
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,450
You might as well commit
matrimonial suicide right now.

792
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:15,650
You want a confession in blood?
Huh? All right.

793
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:18,950
That night at the movie,
I was attracted to you.

794
00:51:19,050 --> 00:51:21,950
I was. You caught me.
I admit it.

795
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,250
I mean, let's see, maybe I was a little
unsure about the whole marriage thing.

796
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:29,600
I don't know,
maybe I was just being a guy...

797
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:32,200
and an opportunity presented itself.

798
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:33,550
Bottom line?

799
00:51:33,650 --> 00:51:36,000
I never thought
I'd see you again.

800
00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:38,900
Bottom line?
Nothing happened.

801
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:41,750
Bottom line?

802
00:51:41,850 --> 00:51:46,200
Now, more than ever,
I believe Fran is the one for me.

803
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:49,150
So...

804
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:52,800
I would say,
based on the evidence...

805
00:51:52,850 --> 00:51:57,200
all your theories on love sound more like
the rantings of a bitter, cynical woman.

806
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:06,600
Once I walked out
on the streets of Laredo

807
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:09,050
And Laredo walked out

808
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:12,000
On the streets with me

809
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:34,700
Excuse me.

810
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,700
There's my good boy.

811
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:59,300
What's going on?

812
00:52:59,350 --> 00:53:03,350
I am measuring you
for your wedding dress.

813
00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:06,650
Dad, I want my house key back.
Dad, dad, please.

814
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:10,350
Where's that old wedding dress?

815
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,450
Now we can finally
get rid of this.

816
00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:15,500
Dad, put that back!

817
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:18,500
Hey, Mary,
what do you want on your bagel?

818
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:21,300
No bagel. No wedding dress.
No wedding.

819
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:22,300
No wedding?

820
00:53:23,650 --> 00:53:26,550
But Massimo said
you announced your engagement.

821
00:53:26,650 --> 00:53:28,500
I never said that.

822
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:31,950
My God, this is like
the blind date that wouldn't end.

823
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:34,450
He's right.

824
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:38,550
You're frightened by
a mounting attraction for him.

825
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:40,300
Oh, that's disgusting.

826
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:45,250
- I told you Mismo was full of crap.
- No Mismo! Massimo! Massimo!

827
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:46,950
Please, go toast the bagel,
mind your own business.

828
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:49,550
Yeah, I'll toast when I see fit.

829
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:52,050
Mismo, Massimo
or any other kind of "mo."

830
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:54,900
Dad, you cannot
push some guy at me.

831
00:53:54,950 --> 00:53:56,900
That's not how it works.

832
00:53:56,950 --> 00:53:58,900
Hey, you know that.
You had Ma.

833
00:53:58,950 --> 00:54:02,450
Yes, and I didn't meet her
until the day of our wedding.

834
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:04,150
What are you talking about?

835
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,300
Your mother and I
had an arranged marriage.

836
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:12,800
An arranged marriage?

837
00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:18,000
We met on the day of our wedding.

838
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:20,550
We couldn't even look at each other.

839
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:23,050
I was in love
with another girl...

840
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:27,400
and your mother
wanted nothing to do with me.

841
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:31,450
She said I had big eyebrows
and a low IQ

842
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:34,600
Anyway, one day...

843
00:54:34,650 --> 00:54:38,800
I got very sick
with scarlet fever...

844
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,700
and she stayed by my side.

845
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,700
She took good care of me.

846
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:48,700
For the first time...

847
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,700
I appreciated her.

848
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:54,850
Then the appreciation
grew to respect.

849
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:58,600
Respect grew to like.

850
00:55:00,050 --> 00:55:03,300
Then like grew to love.

851
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:07,750
A deeper love
than I could ever hope for.

852
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:13,900
So give Massimo a chance.

853
00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:17,400
Maybe you don't like him now...

854
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:20,700
but maybe
you might love him later.

855
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:26,700
I should've told you about
your mother and I a long time ago.

856
00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:29,850
Maybe then you'd feel
differently about love.

857
00:55:33,950 --> 00:55:36,400
I don't feel anything about love.

858
00:55:40,850 --> 00:55:42,800
What do you think, Mary?

859
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:47,550
Oh, the park's great.

860
00:55:48,650 --> 00:55:52,500
You guys would be the first. No one
else has ever been married here before.

861
00:55:57,350 --> 00:56:00,850
Well, we'd have to construct
the site from scratch...

862
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:04,300
but at least you wouldn't
have to cut the guest list.

863
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,800
Dad would love it.

864
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:09,400
And what about
the bride and groom-to-be?

865
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:12,950
- I say, let's take it.
- I think we should keep looking.

866
00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:15,950
- Really?
- Maybe I should give you guys a minute.

867
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:18,750
You don't like it?

868
00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:23,100
I don't know.

869
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,650
Come on.

870
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:34,150
All right, if this is what you want,
then I'm-- I'm fine with it.

871
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:38,500
Do you see why
I'm marrying this guy?

872
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:42,150
Because he is so good to me.

873
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:46,100
Yep, you two will have no problem
planning the wedding while I'm gone.

874
00:56:46,150 --> 00:56:48,650
- I beg your pardon?
- Just for a week.

875
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:50,650
- Gone?
- I've got to fly back east.

876
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:53,150
We're looking at buying out
a few of our manufacturers.

877
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:57,250
- You know Fran, this is a really critical time.
- I know, that's why we shouldn't lose momentum, right?

878
00:56:57,350 --> 00:57:00,800
You guys will do a great job.
I trust you.

879
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:06,550
Fran wants statues at the wedding.

880
00:57:06,650 --> 00:57:11,550
A well-chosen sculpture can help enhance
the tone and theme of the ceremony.

881
00:57:11,550 --> 00:57:13,550
Something like this could be nice.

882
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,550
A little depressing, isn't it?

883
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:18,400
No, it's wistful and romantic.

884
00:57:18,450 --> 00:57:19,800
Oh.

885
00:57:19,850 --> 00:57:21,300
Okay.

886
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:29,250
I always pictured
a small wedding myself.

887
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:31,800
Close friends and family.

888
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:34,850
On the beach somewhere.
Cool, salty breeze.

889
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:40,750
You know, the Aphrodite we passed
on the way in might be perfect.

890
00:57:40,850 --> 00:57:42,750
What about this guy?

891
00:57:42,850 --> 00:57:46,500
Well, this is all wrong for a wedding.
It's too menacing.

892
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:49,100
Mary, I think you're wrong.

893
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:52,100
He's not menacing.
He's masculine.

894
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:54,950
He's the protector.

895
00:57:55,050 --> 00:57:57,100
- This man is strong.
- He's naked.

896
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:58,400
This man is sturdy.

897
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:01,150
Oh, my God.

898
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:03,350
Pick him up
before somebody sees.

899
00:58:04,350 --> 00:58:05,750
You all right?

900
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:11,150
- The man is heavy.
- Oh, my God, there's a guard coming.

901
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:13,950
There.

902
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:16,800
Oh, my God.

903
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:18,750
You castrated him.

904
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:21,550
Oh, no.

905
00:58:21,650 --> 00:58:23,250
The guard's coming this way.

906
00:58:23,350 --> 00:58:26,300
- I'm sorry, buddy.
- We gotta fix him.

907
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:30,150
What do you got?
Oh, of course. Krazy Glue.

908
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:34,500
Why didn't I bring Krazy Glue,
in case his pecker fell off?

909
00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:37,550
- All right, ready?
- Is it sticking?

910
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:40,850
- You got it?
- Yeah, he's on. Oh, shit.

911
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:43,250
Steve's stuck.
Steve's glued to his pecker.

912
00:58:43,350 --> 00:58:44,800
- Hi.
- Hi there.

913
00:58:44,850 --> 00:58:47,200
Sir, touching the statues
isn't permitted.

914
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:48,700
Yes, sir.

915
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,700
You're right.
It's limestone, not granite.

916
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:53,700
We had a bet going.
She won.

917
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,050
- Sir.
- Yeah?

918
00:58:55,150 --> 00:58:56,400
Your hand, sir.

919
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:02,950
Yeah, my hand.

920
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,250
Here it is.
You were right.

921
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,600
A limestone penis.

922
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,850
You'd think he'd be bigger, huh?

923
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,200
All right.

924
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:19,900
Jesus.

925
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:23,650
What else you got in that?

926
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:25,300
My entire universe.

927
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:34,650
- I'm sorry--
- I'm sorry--

928
00:59:34,750 --> 00:59:37,350
- I'm sorry. Go ahead.
- No, you go.

929
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:40,700
I'm sorry about Napa.

930
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:45,550
I didn't mean to call you
bitter and cynical. You're not bitter and cynical.

931
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:49,900
And I'm sorry, what I said about
your marriage being doomed to fail.

932
00:59:51,850 --> 00:59:54,750
Well, I apologize for saying
you were just an opportunity.

933
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:58,000
That was pretty ugly of me.

934
00:59:58,050 --> 01:00:02,100
And I was only half serious
about the teal bridesmaid thing.

935
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:06,200
Well, at least I have
a 50-50 chance, right?

936
01:00:07,850 --> 01:00:10,800
You and Fran are gonna be
real happy together.

937
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:14,850
So are you and Massimo.
It's gonna work.

938
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:18,750
Yeah, well, um,
we're not engaged anymore.

939
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:22,550
- Really?
- Really.

940
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
- Are you okay with that?
- Yeah.

941
01:00:27,850 --> 01:00:30,750
It was more my dad
trying to get us together.

942
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,600
What do you mean, why would he want to do that?

943
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:41,800
Well, probably because
he was so happy with my mom.

944
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:00,550
Fran said to go ahead and go forward
with the violet chocolate--

945
01:01:00,650 --> 01:01:03,300
- The chocolate one?
- The one that you suggested.

946
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:05,700
Good. Then I'll
put in that order today.

947
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:08,000
- How is Fran?
- She's good.

948
01:01:08,050 --> 01:01:11,750
She's making deals, kickin' butt.
You know, being Fran.

949
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:17,950
Oh, nicely done.

950
01:01:21,350 --> 01:01:23,850
- Thank you, Mary.
- You're welcome.

951
01:01:23,850 --> 01:01:25,500
You wanna keep it?

952
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:28,150
Sure.

953
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:36,550
Wow, it's a nice day.

954
01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:40,700
I agree with you
about the small wedding.

955
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:44,500
That's the way I'd do it too.

956
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:54,750
Papa.

957
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:03,700
How nice to see you.

958
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:06,050
Where's my father?

959
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:10,000
He's out buying the balloons
for Burt's birthday party.

960
01:02:10,750 --> 01:02:12,350
Tell him I was here.

961
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,050
Wait, Mary.

962
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:16,150
Are you mad with me?

963
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:17,750
Yes...

964
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:19,550
I'm mad at you.

965
01:02:19,650 --> 01:02:22,000
You told my father
we were engaged.

966
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:25,000
He tried to measure me
for a wedding dress.

967
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:28,050
What is the matter with you?
You never listen.

968
01:02:28,150 --> 01:02:31,800
Massimo, we are not going to
be together like that. Okay?

969
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:35,400
- And why are you in my father's house?
- I am sorry. I will leave you alone.

970
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:40,450
From now on, I will no longer bother you.
From now on, We will be just friends.

971
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:43,450
Oh, you think we can be friends
just like that?

972
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:46,850
I want to apologize
for any madness I caused you.

973
01:02:46,950 --> 01:02:48,300
Is this a trick?

974
01:02:48,350 --> 01:02:50,300
No tricks.
I'm very serious.

975
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:53,850
I just want for us to be
buddy-buddy.

976
01:02:55,350 --> 01:02:57,800
I promise you.

977
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:02,100
Do you have plans for dinner?

978
01:03:02,150 --> 01:03:05,950
No, as a friend, I want to
make for you a wonderful...

979
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,950
American dish.

980
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:10,750
Sit. I will start.

981
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,750
That's your specialty?
Instant macaroni and cheese?

982
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:18,200
It is a low-budget wonder.

983
01:03:18,250 --> 01:03:20,700
Already today,
I've eaten three boxes.

984
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:24,500
Nothing like
a well-balanced diet.

985
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:25,600
Gratie.

986
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:41,550
- You remind me so much of your mother.
- You don't remember my mother.

987
01:03:41,650 --> 01:03:43,650
Yeah, I remember your mother.

988
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:46,900
She had the same big smile...

989
01:03:46,950 --> 01:03:49,100
and the same dark hair.

990
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:53,100
She had no nail on her little finger.
I don't remember why.

991
01:03:55,150 --> 01:03:58,700
Yeah, a brick fell on it from the kitchen,
when she was little. It never grew back.

992
01:03:58,750 --> 01:04:00,950
You see?
We have much history together.

993
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,950
I guess we sort of do.

994
01:04:09,050 --> 01:04:11,950
You look like
you have much on your mind.

995
01:04:12,050 --> 01:04:13,450
Not at all.

996
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:16,200
Well, I mean, we're friends...

997
01:04:16,250 --> 01:04:19,650
and friends listen when friends
are not feeling so good...

998
01:04:19,750 --> 01:04:21,850
so please to tell me.

999
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:27,500
There's nothing to tell.

1000
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:30,500
I thought I could control everything,
and I can't.

1001
01:04:31,650 --> 01:04:34,600
I met someone who I thought was--

1002
01:04:34,650 --> 01:04:36,150
Well, he's not.

1003
01:04:41,350 --> 01:04:44,550
Did you ever like somebody,
but the timing was off?

1004
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:47,000
Way off?

1005
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:51,800
You feel things that
you should not be feeling?

1006
01:04:54,750 --> 01:04:56,650
I'm not making any sense.

1007
01:04:58,750 --> 01:05:00,700
You make much sense.

1008
01:05:03,050 --> 01:05:06,400
You long for him
the way I long for you.

1009
01:05:10,150 --> 01:05:12,050
Massimo, I don't want you to think--

1010
01:05:12,150 --> 01:05:14,050
I want to tell you something.

1011
01:05:15,950 --> 01:05:18,550
You need to learn the patience.

1012
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:21,700
I mean love can't always be perfect.

1013
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:23,700
Love is just love.

1014
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,950
My mom used to say that.

1015
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,550
Your mother was a very wise woman.

1016
01:05:36,950 --> 01:05:38,300
Eat. Mangia.

1017
01:05:49,650 --> 01:05:54,800
So we'll start with camellias as a base,
that's what a friend and I discussed,
and anything else that jumps out at you.

1018
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:58,300
- Let me know.
- Okay.

1019
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:00,150
Roses.

1020
01:06:00,250 --> 01:06:01,650
Wreaths.

1021
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:03,800
We don't need any more statues.

1022
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,250
How about this beauty?

1023
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:08,450
Interesting.

1024
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:11,050
This is called a bleeding heart...

1025
01:06:11,150 --> 01:06:13,950
the official funeral flower
of Tibet.

1026
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,200
I knew I'd be good at this.

1027
01:06:17,350 --> 01:06:19,200
I'll take
some Slit-My-Wrists-Susans...

1028
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:21,200
and we'll be ready.

1029
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:26,650
How'd you guys meet?

1030
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:28,800
- Me and Fran?
- Yeah.

1031
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:30,350
College.

1032
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:32,400
She was in one of your classes?

1033
01:06:32,450 --> 01:06:34,550
No, she was a bookie, actually.

1034
01:06:34,650 --> 01:06:37,100
- Fran was a bookie?
- Yeah, she was a bookie.

1035
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:39,100
She single-handedly established...

1036
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:41,500
this underground gambling ring
at UC Berkeley...

1037
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:44,300
took bets on every sporting event
that you could imagine, ran numbers...

1038
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:47,300
and even hosted a Vegas night
at her sorority house.

1039
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:49,800
- You're lying.
- No, that was Fran.

1040
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:52,850
- Orchids? Does that work?
- Yeah, orchids would work.

1041
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:54,200
Okay.

1042
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:56,200
Yeah, she was the coolest.

1043
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:59,450
I was the bookworm, she was
the wild child, and she picked me.

1044
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:03,700
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

1045
01:07:05,050 --> 01:07:07,250
- How about cabbage?
- My God.

1046
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:10,800
- What's the matter?
- Just hide me.

1047
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:13,850
- Mary, what are you doing?
- Don't say my name!

1048
01:07:13,950 --> 01:07:15,450
Oh, my God.

1049
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:36,050
You okay?

1050
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:37,550
I found it.

1051
01:07:40,650 --> 01:07:43,050
Hi. How you doing?
I'm Steve Edison.

1052
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:46,050
Keith Richmond.
My wife Wendy.

1053
01:07:46,100 --> 01:07:48,250
- Hi!
- Nice to meet you, Wendy.

1054
01:07:49,650 --> 01:07:52,000
So, how do you all know each other?

1055
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:56,100
- It's a long story.
- Oh, let me tell it.

1056
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:58,100
It's really a funny story.

1057
01:07:58,200 --> 01:07:59,600
See, Keith...

1058
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:01,350
was my fiance.

1059
01:08:01,450 --> 01:08:04,900
And Wendy was
his high school girlfriend.

1060
01:08:04,950 --> 01:08:08,350
On the night of our rehearsal dinner,
I found them making out.

1061
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:12,750
In my car.

1062
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:16,050
I think that covers
all the high points.

1063
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:18,050
Did I leave anything out?

1064
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,550
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1065
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:28,200
This home?

1066
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:32,400
You wanna go up?

1067
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:45,550
All right? You okay?

1068
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:49,850
Jezebel was the only queen in the Bible
to be eaten by dogs.

1069
01:08:49,950 --> 01:08:52,900
- Did she fall down in the street?
- That's yours.

1070
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:56,450
Hang on. Hang on.

1071
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,600
- Mr. and Mrs. Wilfred Barber.
- No, it's not that one.

1072
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:07,750
Nancy Pong.

1073
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:15,150
Who is it?

1074
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:17,250
Nancy Pong? 2C?

1075
01:09:17,350 --> 01:09:20,150
- Yes.
- Nancy, would you buzz us in, please?

1076
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:23,250
It's Mary Fiore, 7H.

1077
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:25,200
Who?

1078
01:09:25,250 --> 01:09:26,500
You don't know me.

1079
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:29,500
We haven't met because...

1080
01:09:30,650 --> 01:09:33,250
I'm a control freak...

1081
01:09:33,250 --> 01:09:35,750
and I don't have time for people.

1082
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:40,400
But if you ever need
to borrow a cup of sugar...

1083
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:43,550
I can't help you...

1084
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:48,300
'cause I don't have time to shop.

1085
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:00,700
I wanna go home.

1086
01:10:01,950 --> 01:10:03,650
We are home.

1087
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:06,350
We're just out on the porch.

1088
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:07,850
All right?

1089
01:10:09,650 --> 01:10:11,550
He's married...

1090
01:10:13,050 --> 01:10:15,350
and they're gonna have a baby.

1091
01:10:17,950 --> 01:10:19,850
And he looked good.

1092
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:22,250
No, he didn't.

1093
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:24,800
- No, he really didn't.
- He did.

1094
01:10:28,350 --> 01:10:31,600
Hold it there, please. Thank you.
Here we go. We're in.

1095
01:10:31,650 --> 01:10:35,150
- I don't know him.
- I know, but this guy is gonna hold the door for us.

1096
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:38,300
Come here. Here we go.
Stand up.

1097
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,300
Hold that position. Here we go.

1098
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:43,850
We got your beer, we got your purse,
we got you, we got your keys.

1099
01:10:43,950 --> 01:10:46,200
Hi there.
Here we go.

1100
01:10:46,250 --> 01:10:49,200
This is somebody that lives
in the same building. Thank you.

1101
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:51,400
Are you Nancy Pong?

1102
01:10:52,750 --> 01:10:54,900
Okay, a little bit more.

1103
01:10:57,250 --> 01:10:59,200
A little fire.

1104
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:07,750
Medium well.

1105
01:11:09,050 --> 01:11:11,950
You really don't think
he looked good?

1106
01:11:12,050 --> 01:11:14,450
Oh, no.
He looked old.

1107
01:11:14,550 --> 01:11:16,400
You know?

1108
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:19,450
Unhappy and fat.
He put on a couple pounds.

1109
01:11:19,550 --> 01:11:20,950
Be quiet.

1110
01:11:26,950 --> 01:11:29,400
He said they were just friends...

1111
01:11:30,750 --> 01:11:32,850
but deep down, I knew better.

1112
01:11:40,150 --> 01:11:42,050
I was just a stand-in.

1113
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,700
A poor man's Wendy.

1114
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:53,050
Did you know that
she threw my bridal shower for me?

1115
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:57,400
She even took time to freeze mint leaves
and raspberries in ice cubes.

1116
01:11:57,400 --> 01:12:00,550
That should've tipped me off
right there.

1117
01:12:00,650 --> 01:12:02,550
She was trying too hard.

1118
01:12:07,300 --> 01:12:08,700
Jerk.

1119
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:15,750
It's a good thing I didn't marry him.

1120
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,400
But most of the time I think...

1121
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:31,100
I just wasn't enough.

1122
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:39,000
No, no, no, you're wrong.

1123
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:47,150
And another thing.

1124
01:12:49,750 --> 01:12:51,200
This Wendy...

1125
01:12:53,300 --> 01:12:56,500
she's nothing but a poor man's Mary.

1126
01:13:26,250 --> 01:13:27,650
It's getting late.

1127
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:35,050
I'd better go.

1128
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:42,450
I'll walk you to the door.

1129
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:45,450
- That's all right. Stay there.
- No, it's okay.

1130
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:50,200
- Wait.
- Take your time. You all right?

1131
01:13:56,700 --> 01:13:59,600
Thanks for tonight.
I know that I was a mess.

1132
01:13:59,700 --> 01:14:02,900
No, you weren't a mess.

1133
01:14:04,050 --> 01:14:05,500
A little bit.

1134
01:14:07,450 --> 01:14:08,550
Shut up.

1135
01:14:08,650 --> 01:14:11,200
- You gonna be okay?
- Yeah.

1136
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:15,250
Two aspirin, a lot of water,
sleep, and a beer in the morning.

1137
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:17,450
That's the cure.

1138
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:19,700
- Good night, Mary.
- Good night.

1139
01:14:54,850 --> 01:14:57,000
Did you ever think about
that night in the park?

1140
01:14:57,100 --> 01:14:58,300
What?

1141
01:15:02,950 --> 01:15:04,900
I barely know you.

1142
01:15:06,250 --> 01:15:09,000
I don't know your dad's first name.

1143
01:15:09,050 --> 01:15:13,650
I don't know if you ever wore braces
or contacts or glasses.

1144
01:15:13,750 --> 01:15:16,650
I have no idea how you came to be
a wedding planner, Mary.

1145
01:15:22,550 --> 01:15:24,700
But I know
the curves of your face...

1146
01:15:27,850 --> 01:15:30,800
and I know every fleck of gold
in your eyes.

1147
01:15:36,050 --> 01:15:38,350
And I know that
that night in the park...

1148
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:44,400
was the best time I've ever had.

1149
01:15:58,650 --> 01:16:00,350
Please say something.

1150
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:05,000
I'm a magnet for unavailable men...

1151
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:10,550
and I'm sick of it.

1152
01:16:15,050 --> 01:16:16,450
It's simple.

1153
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:20,250
I know Fran.

1154
01:16:21,950 --> 01:16:23,450
I respect her.

1155
01:16:25,950 --> 01:16:27,400
And she loves you.

1156
01:16:32,150 --> 01:16:34,700
So, besides your tux measurements...

1157
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:38,650
that's all I need to know.

1158
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:47,500
Please go away.

1159
01:16:54,750 --> 01:16:56,550
Good night, Mary.

1160
01:17:18,250 --> 01:17:20,200
How do you word an invitation...

1161
01:17:20,250 --> 01:17:22,700
where both sets of parents
are paying for the wedding...

1162
01:17:22,750 --> 01:17:25,700
the groom is in the military,
about to receive a medical degree...

1163
01:17:25,750 --> 01:17:29,350
and the bride is a young widow whose father
recently had a sex-change operation...

1164
01:17:29,450 --> 01:17:32,900
and now goes by the name
Sugar Pie deSanto?

1165
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,950
- Mary?
- What, what is it?

1166
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,950
A little tense?

1167
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,950
No... just terribly, terribly...

1168
01:17:40,050 --> 01:17:41,150
alert.

1169
01:17:45,850 --> 01:17:47,050
What's the matter?

1170
01:17:47,150 --> 01:17:49,200
I came back early.

1171
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:54,050
Why?
I mean, is everything okay?

1172
01:17:54,150 --> 01:17:56,300
I've discovered something.

1173
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,400
I've been blind.
I didn't want to see it.

1174
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:04,850
I tried to ignore the signs.

1175
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,100
I think you know
what I'm talking about.

1176
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:11,850
Let me explain.
It's not what you think.

1177
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:13,400
Yes, it is.

1178
01:18:15,150 --> 01:18:17,150
I can't go through with this wedding.

1179
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:20,450
But, Fran--

1180
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:23,900
I was in a meeting
talking about Boccolino mozzarella...

1181
01:18:23,950 --> 01:18:26,900
and it hit me
that this isn't going to work.

1182
01:18:28,250 --> 01:18:31,350
I can't stand the way
he chews on pen caps...

1183
01:18:31,450 --> 01:18:34,400
or the songs
that he sings in the shower.

1184
01:18:34,450 --> 01:18:40,050
It drives me nuts, the way that he hikes up his
left pant leg after he's eaten too much.

1185
01:18:41,450 --> 01:18:45,550
Is Eddie gonna be the last man
that I sleep with...

1186
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:47,050
ever?

1187
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:53,450
I've been with him so long, I don't
even know why we're together anymore.

1188
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:02,700
Look at me.

1189
01:19:05,750 --> 01:19:07,700
You are exquisite.

1190
01:19:10,300 --> 01:19:11,500
You're timeless.

1191
01:19:13,650 --> 01:19:16,600
And you have the love
of a man named Steve.

1192
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:24,050
A man who, while you were away having
meetings about mozzarella, said to me...

1193
01:19:24,150 --> 01:19:27,050
"I can't believe she picked me.

1194
01:19:29,750 --> 01:19:33,750
I can't believe I'm marrying the most
incredible woman I've ever met."

1195
01:19:40,150 --> 01:19:43,100
So that tells me
that this marriage of yours...

1196
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:46,450
is not only gonna work...

1197
01:19:49,050 --> 01:19:51,200
it's gonna last forever.

1198
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:54,900
Really?

1199
01:19:57,650 --> 01:19:58,850
Really.

1200
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:04,050
Thank you.

1201
01:20:07,900 --> 01:20:09,850
Thank you, thank you.

1202
01:20:13,450 --> 01:20:15,750
For he's a jolly good fellow

1203
01:20:15,850 --> 01:20:18,650
For he's a jolly good fellow

1204
01:20:18,750 --> 01:20:21,300
- Which nobody can deny
- No one deny

1205
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,900
Let me pray, let me pray.

1206
01:20:34,250 --> 01:20:37,250
Hope he didn't spit on the cake.

1207
01:20:37,250 --> 01:20:39,350
Come on.
Open up your presents.

1208
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:44,550
No, no, please.
Everyone, I want to make some toast.

1209
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,600
- Happy birthday, Burt.
- Salute.

1210
01:20:49,650 --> 01:20:53,850
Burt, Burt, buddy Burt.
Salvatore.

1211
01:20:53,900 --> 01:20:57,950
I want to thank Salvatore
for taking me into his life...

1212
01:20:58,050 --> 01:21:01,300
and introducing me
to all you wonderful people.

1213
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:07,450
Hold on a moment.

1214
01:21:09,350 --> 01:21:11,250
Where is he going?

1215
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Mary...

1216
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:47,650
I know I never done the right thing,
I never say the right thing...

1217
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:49,800
and I act like a fool.

1218
01:21:53,050 --> 01:21:56,650
I know I say
we're just buddy-buddy friends...

1219
01:21:56,700 --> 01:21:59,700
but that would not be true
to my heart.

1220
01:22:01,350 --> 01:22:04,000
So I would ask you
this one question.

1221
01:22:04,050 --> 01:22:06,000
And if you answer no...

1222
01:22:08,050 --> 01:22:11,000
then I will leave you alone
once and for all.

1223
01:22:16,100 --> 01:22:18,600
Be my wife, Mary Fiore...

1224
01:22:20,350 --> 01:22:25,750
and I will take care of you
and be true to you...

1225
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:29,450
and, like this house
I built for your dolls...

1226
01:22:29,550 --> 01:22:33,700
I will make sure you have
a strong roof over your head.

1227
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:36,650
If your answer is yes...

1228
01:22:36,700 --> 01:22:40,250
then no one will ever love you
as much as I love you.

1229
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
If your answer is yes...

1230
01:22:45,950 --> 01:22:49,400
you will make me
the happiest man on the Earth.

1231
01:25:37,050 --> 01:25:39,050
What would I have done
without you?

1232
01:25:39,050 --> 01:25:41,850
Hey, wedding woman,
you did some job.

1233
01:25:41,950 --> 01:25:45,250
My girl's gonna knock 'em dead.
Aren't you, sluggo?

1234
01:25:45,350 --> 01:25:49,250
Well, somebody stole my lucky mike.
I can't sing without my lucky mike.

1235
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:29,700
What are you doing here?

1236
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:32,900
You know it's bad luck
to see the bride before the wedding.

1237
01:26:36,150 --> 01:26:37,400
You look beautiful.

1238
01:26:38,250 --> 01:26:41,850
Go on. Get out of here.
We're starting any minute.

1239
01:26:41,950 --> 01:26:43,350
Come on.

1240
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:47,800
- Let's take a walk.
- A walk?

1241
01:26:47,900 --> 01:26:50,250
A walk. Come on.

1242
01:26:50,350 --> 01:26:51,750
Come on.

1243
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,600
No. What are you talking about?
You cannot give the whole wedding to me.

1244
01:26:56,700 --> 01:26:59,500
Everything is gonna be fine.
It's a no-brainer.

1245
01:26:59,550 --> 01:27:01,450
You can't do this.
Geri's out there!

1246
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:04,500
So?
The whole commission is yours.

1247
01:27:06,200 --> 01:27:07,800
That's more money
than I make in a year.

1248
01:27:07,850 --> 01:27:11,750
Well then I guess that means we're gonna
have to go shopping next week.

1249
01:27:13,700 --> 01:27:16,700
I am completely confused.
Why are you doing this?

1250
01:27:18,250 --> 01:27:19,350
Because there's somewhere
I've gotta be.

1251
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:23,300
Okay, we can talk
after the wedding.

1252
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:25,400
Hang on a minute, Fran.

1253
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:31,850
- Why do you wanna marry me?
- What?

1254
01:27:31,950 --> 01:27:34,100
That's one of the questions
I need answered.

1255
01:27:35,650 --> 01:27:37,300
Ok, Steve, you're scaring me.

1256
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:39,950
You never call me Steve.

1257
01:27:40,700 --> 01:27:42,200
That's because you don't like it.

1258
01:27:44,550 --> 01:27:46,550
No, I never said I didn't like it.

1259
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:52,100
- Okay, where is this going?
- Why do you wanna marry me?

1260
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:56,400
Are you kidding me?

1261
01:27:56,450 --> 01:27:58,400
- Are you kidding me?
- No, I'm not.

1262
01:27:58,450 --> 01:28:02,100
You're trying to dump me
on the day of my wedding.

1263
01:28:02,150 --> 01:28:05,400
- I am not trying to dump you,
I just need to know your answer to that question.
- This is not happening to me.

1264
01:28:05,450 --> 01:28:07,950
- Franny, Franny.
- This is not-- don't "Franny" me!

1265
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,600
Don't "Franny" me,
you selfish bastard!

1266
01:28:10,700 --> 01:28:13,500
Listen, the reasons we were together in college
don't hold up anymore.

1267
01:28:13,550 --> 01:28:15,500
We're different people now.

1268
01:28:15,550 --> 01:28:18,100
- And?
- And I think you know that.

1269
01:28:19,450 --> 01:28:21,350
Listen to me, Franny.

1270
01:28:21,450 --> 01:28:24,450
If you really love me,
I'll put this cummerbund on right now...

1271
01:28:24,550 --> 01:28:27,900
we'll walk up that hill
and go to the big tent and do it.

1272
01:28:27,950 --> 01:28:30,650
- You would do that?
- Yes, I would.

1273
01:28:33,300 --> 01:28:35,100
All those people.

1274
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:37,750
You don't know half of 'em.

1275
01:28:39,350 --> 01:28:41,250
You and me.

1276
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:44,400
Are you ready?

1277
01:28:47,650 --> 01:28:50,550
Yes. Yes, of course.

1278
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,250
I just need a second.

1279
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,400
Oh, God.

1280
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,000
No...

1281
01:29:27,750 --> 01:29:30,700
I don't want to get married.

1282
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:25,400
How did we let it get this far?

1283
01:30:26,900 --> 01:30:28,400
I don't know.

1284
01:30:29,650 --> 01:30:31,750
What are we gonna do?

1285
01:30:33,750 --> 01:30:36,750
Well, that's the beauty of it.

1286
01:30:36,850 --> 01:30:38,800
Whatever we want.

1287
01:30:41,900 --> 01:30:46,100
I haven't thought about
what I really want in so long.

1288
01:30:46,150 --> 01:30:47,600
Me neither.

1289
01:30:56,350 --> 01:30:58,850
There you go.

1290
01:31:04,550 --> 01:31:05,650
Okay.

1291
01:31:07,300 --> 01:31:09,450
Okay.

1292
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:23,400
That is the bride.
Is that the bride?

1293
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:25,300
Yes, it is.

1294
01:31:25,350 --> 01:31:27,300
Well, is she coming back?

1295
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:27,900
No.

1296
01:31:31,650 --> 01:31:35,400
I think that all the blood is rushing
to my head and I'm gonna faint.

1297
01:31:35,450 --> 01:31:37,950
I'm gonna kill Mary
for leaving me all alone here.

1298
01:31:37,950 --> 01:31:39,950
- I don't know what to do.
- Penny, take a breath.

1299
01:31:40,050 --> 01:31:42,150
What are you talking about?

1300
01:31:42,250 --> 01:31:45,300
I'm talking about your wedding planner
leaving me here all alone...

1301
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:47,550
to go to city hall
and get married.

1302
01:31:47,650 --> 01:31:49,550
Married?

1303
01:31:49,650 --> 01:31:52,300
- What? Mary's getting married?
- Yeah, married.

1304
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:54,850
- You know, married?
- No, she can't get married.

1305
01:31:54,900 --> 01:31:56,850
- Married.
- Hey, hey, city hall.

1306
01:31:56,900 --> 01:32:00,350
Married, you know, like what
you're supposed to be doing.

1307
01:32:00,350 --> 01:32:03,100
Oh, that's-- Yeah.

1308
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:07,500
That's great. Go. I'll tell everyone.
I'll tell Kathie Lee Gifford.

1309
01:32:13,450 --> 01:32:15,700
Beautiful.

1310
01:32:15,750 --> 01:32:17,300
Thanks.

1311
01:32:51,100 --> 01:32:53,200
Come on! Goddamn it.

1312
01:32:53,300 --> 01:32:55,700
Are you sure you
don't know a shortcut?

1313
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:58,050
Take a shortcut somewhere?

1314
01:32:58,150 --> 01:33:00,050
- What do you expect me--
- Bullshit.

1315
01:33:00,150 --> 01:33:02,350
What are you doing?

1316
01:33:04,150 --> 01:33:06,850
Hold on the right. Hold!

1317
01:33:17,050 --> 01:33:20,300
We are gathered together
in the presence of these witnesses...

1318
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:23,850
to join this man and this woman...

1319
01:33:23,900 --> 01:33:25,900
in matrimony.

1320
01:33:25,950 --> 01:33:28,750
This contract is not
to be taken lightly...

1321
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:32,550
but thoughtfully and seriously...

1322
01:33:32,650 --> 01:33:35,000
with a deep realization...

1323
01:33:35,050 --> 01:33:39,550
of its obligations
and responsibilities.

1324
01:33:39,650 --> 01:33:41,600
If anyone can show just cause...

1325
01:33:41,700 --> 01:33:45,850
why these two should not
be joined together in matrimony...

1326
01:33:45,900 --> 01:33:48,450
then let him speak now
or forever...

1327
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:50,450
hold his peace.

1328
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:57,900
Fine.

1329
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,600
- Then let us proceed.
- No.

1330
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:04,250
- Thank God.
- Oh, hell, I object too.

1331
01:34:04,300 --> 01:34:05,600
What is going on here?

1332
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:09,100
Here we go.

1333
01:34:13,450 --> 01:34:17,400
Maria, I look in your eyes
and it hurts my insides.

1334
01:34:17,450 --> 01:34:21,300
This is not what you want.
This is what I want.

1335
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:23,050
Shame on me.

1336
01:34:23,100 --> 01:34:25,150
I'm so lucky
to have a father like you.

1337
01:34:27,150 --> 01:34:28,450
But you're right.

1338
01:34:29,900 --> 01:34:32,500
Love isn't like
some enchanted evening...

1339
01:34:33,750 --> 01:34:35,400
isn't a fairy tale...

1340
01:34:35,450 --> 01:34:37,950
or even love at first sight.

1341
01:34:39,300 --> 01:34:41,600
That isn't real life.

1342
01:34:44,650 --> 01:34:46,650
Massimo's a good man.

1343
01:34:46,700 --> 01:34:48,500
Don't worry, Papa.

1344
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:51,350
I know what I'm doing.

1345
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:55,250
I'm just all grown up now.

1346
01:35:01,850 --> 01:35:03,800
Okay.

1347
01:35:09,150 --> 01:35:10,950
Hey, that's the doc!

1348
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,250
- Steve!
- Oh, yes.

1349
01:35:13,300 --> 01:35:15,500
- You know the doctor?
- Mary. Where's Mary?

1350
01:35:15,550 --> 01:35:17,500
I'm her father.
Who the hell are you?

1351
01:35:17,550 --> 01:35:19,750
- He's the doctor.
- I'm Steve, the doctor.

1352
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:22,250
- I'm in love with your daughter.
- You are the one?

1353
01:35:22,300 --> 01:35:25,050
- What the hell is going on?
- I'm sorry, but I am.

1354
01:35:25,150 --> 01:35:27,800
- What about Fran?
- Fran and I did not get married.

1355
01:35:27,850 --> 01:35:29,800
That's been happening a lot today.

1356
01:35:29,850 --> 01:35:31,550
Whoa. You didn't get married?

1357
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:35,150
We're not married. I am not the one.
You are the one, Steve.

1358
01:35:35,250 --> 01:35:37,600
And you didn't get married?
She's not married?

1359
01:35:37,650 --> 01:35:41,200
She does not love me.
She loves-- She loves you, Steve.

1360
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:46,950
I could never forgive myself if ever
I got in the way of Mary's true love.

1361
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,350
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm Steve.

1362
01:35:49,450 --> 01:35:50,750
He's Steve. He's the one.

1363
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:52,750
I'm the doctor.
I'm in love with Mary.

1364
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:54,750
Wait a minute!
Hold the phone.

1365
01:35:54,850 --> 01:35:58,500
You mean to tell me,
you love her and she loves you...

1366
01:35:58,600 --> 01:36:00,600
and neither of you
got married today?

1367
01:36:00,700 --> 01:36:02,350
That's what I'm saying.

1368
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:05,450
Then what the hell are you
standing around talking to us for?

1369
01:36:05,550 --> 01:36:08,750
I don't know. Where is she?
Where is Mary? Somebody take me to Mary.

1370
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:10,300
I take you. Come on.

1371
01:36:10,350 --> 01:36:12,550
- I like him.
- He's a doctor.

1372
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:25,250
Congratulations!

1373
01:36:25,350 --> 01:36:26,700
Fabulous!

1374
01:36:26,750 --> 01:36:28,700
Good for you!

1375
01:36:30,500 --> 01:36:33,850
- Congratulations!
- Go, go. Thank you.

1376
01:36:56,600 --> 01:36:58,550
Thank you, Massimo!

1377
01:36:58,650 --> 01:37:00,750
You better be good to her!

1378
01:37:00,850 --> 01:37:03,650
I still do more chin-ups than you!

1379
01:37:31,550 --> 01:37:34,500
Why are you only eating
the brown ones?

1380
01:37:43,650 --> 01:37:46,550
Because someone once said that...

1381
01:37:46,650 --> 01:37:50,600
they had less artificial coloring
because chocolate's already brown.

1382
01:37:56,050 --> 01:37:58,150
And it kind of stayed with me.

1383
01:38:04,150 --> 01:38:06,000
You kind of stayed with me.

1384
01:38:15,400 --> 01:38:16,850
Where's Fran?

1385
01:38:17,900 --> 01:38:20,650
She's in Tahiti...

1386
01:38:20,750 --> 01:38:22,650
on our honeymoon.

1387
01:38:25,550 --> 01:38:27,150
We didn't get married.

1388
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:33,100
Because?

1389
01:38:35,650 --> 01:38:38,900
Because she needs to
find her own life.

1390
01:38:44,750 --> 01:38:46,650
And I--

1391
01:38:49,400 --> 01:38:50,800
You what?

1392
01:38:54,100 --> 01:38:55,650
What does Steve want?

1393
01:38:56,800 --> 01:38:58,400
I want to dance...

1394
01:39:02,450 --> 01:39:04,350
with you.

1395
01:39:53,500 --> 01:39:59,000
