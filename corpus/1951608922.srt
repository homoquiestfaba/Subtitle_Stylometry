1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,423
Previously on Kyle XY...

2
00:00:01,637 --> 00:00:05,477
-What are you doing?
-I'm keeping a list: What makes Kyle an alien.

3
00:00:05,477 --> 00:00:12,458
He's this super brain with amnesia.
He barely knows what you're saying sometimes, but does calculus like
it's two plus two.

4
00:00:12,458 --> 00:00:14,891
I'm telling ya, Kyle is not human.

5
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,770
-You don't...you don't have a belly button.
-No.

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,832
-Why not?
-I don't know.

7
00:00:20,205 --> 00:00:26,090
-Anyway, I should apologize.
-I screw up all the time. Maybe it's your turn.

8
00:00:34,527 --> 00:00:37,378
-Do they have any suspects?
-No. Not yet.

9
00:00:37,664 --> 00:00:40,814
-Does this mean anything to you?
-No.

10
00:00:40,847 --> 00:00:42,803
Stephen, I think someone's breaking in.

11
00:00:42,852 --> 00:00:45,099
-This is Tom from our security company.
-Hello, sir.

12
00:00:45,102 --> 00:00:48,610
-You just happened to be driving by?
-Yeah. It's a lucky thing, huh?

13
00:02:17,816 --> 00:02:20,112
Thanks, man.
It's pretty wet out there.

14
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:23,273
Whew! You're Kyle, right?

15
00:02:23,505 --> 00:02:25,741
-The amnesia guy?
-Yeah.

16
00:02:27,128 --> 00:02:30,392
You broke the window at my party.
My dad had an aneurysm over that one.

17
00:02:31,656 --> 00:02:34,361
-Sorry.
-He has aneurysms over everything.

18
00:02:35,495 --> 00:02:36,913
So, whatever. It's cool.

19
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:39,593
You mind?

20
00:02:41,546 --> 00:02:43,080
You know, Lori's sleeping.

21
00:02:43,507 --> 00:02:44,873
Well, yeah. It's pretty late.

22
00:02:46,377 --> 00:02:47,461
I need a place to crash.

23
00:02:48,447 --> 00:02:51,171
I know it wasn't too smart to climb in
through a window in the rain.

24
00:02:51,675 --> 00:02:52,510
You're bleeding.

25
00:02:54,108 --> 00:02:58,462
-Crap. Sorry.
-It's okay, but what happened to you?

26
00:02:58,748 --> 00:03:00,262
It's a long story. It's too boring.

27
00:03:01,156 --> 00:03:03,742
Hey, you got an extra blanket or something?
I'll crash on your floor.

28
00:03:10,988 --> 00:03:13,883
-What is this place?
-My bedroom.

29
00:03:15,285 --> 00:03:16,283
Where's the bed?

30
00:03:22,117 --> 00:03:24,722
-You sleep in a tub?
-Yeah.

31
00:03:26,798 --> 00:03:28,973
Trager said you were a head case.

32
00:03:34,665 --> 00:03:37,243
I mean, not like rudely.

33
00:03:38,265 --> 00:03:39,570
Whatever. It's cool.

34
00:03:40,347 --> 00:03:41,931
The rain should let up by morning.

35
00:03:42,186 --> 00:03:45,332
Actually, it won't let up until 2:27 tomorrow afternoon.

36
00:03:48,098 --> 00:03:50,142
Yeah. Whatever.

37
00:04:43,226 --> 00:04:45,752
-Tell me you're joking.
-No. He's right in here.

38
00:04:51,088 --> 00:04:53,043
This is so not good.
What are you doing here?

39
00:04:53,055 --> 00:04:55,185
I got a fight with my dad. Needed a place to crash.

40
00:04:55,185 --> 00:04:59,726
If my parents find you, I am dead.
And that is nothing compared to what
my dad will do to you.

41
00:04:59,726 --> 00:05:00,782
Relax, Trager.

42
00:05:01,237 --> 00:05:03,871
No. They will never believe that you weren't in my room.

43
00:05:03,895 --> 00:05:06,321
The one time I'm not actually doing anything wrong?

44
00:05:07,285 --> 00:05:08,913
Today, of all days?

45
00:05:11,127 --> 00:05:12,433
What did you do to your head?

46
00:05:14,187 --> 00:05:15,593
Slipped on some wet leaves.

47
00:05:17,138 --> 00:05:18,462
Drink much?

48
00:05:19,176 --> 00:05:21,201
I can just sneak out.
They'll never even know I was here.

49
00:05:21,398 --> 00:05:22,420
They better not.

50
00:05:24,676 --> 00:05:27,741
Just don't make a sound.

51
00:05:44,476 --> 00:05:47,640
Oh, man! You're up too early!

52
00:05:47,737 --> 00:05:50,480
I thought I'd have at least another half hour to get breakfast ready.

53
00:05:50,655 --> 00:05:54,203
-Guess I'm turning over a new leaf.
-Happy birthday, honey.

54
00:05:54,248 --> 00:05:56,441
Oh! Thanks, Mom.

55
00:05:57,258 --> 00:06:00,500
-I love you. 
-Oh, I know.

56
00:06:01,825 --> 00:06:03,473
I love you, too.

57
00:06:09,965 --> 00:06:11,253
Good morning.

58
00:06:13,598 --> 00:06:15,080
It's nice to meet you, Mr. Trager.

59
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:16,680
I'm Declan McDunaugh.

60
00:06:17,156 --> 00:06:19,510
I just stopped by to wish Lori a happy birthday.

61
00:06:19,826 --> 00:06:22,643
Declan, huh?
Well, it's nice to finally meet you.

62
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:24,820
Do I smell pancakes?

63
00:06:25,767 --> 00:06:27,132
So, what happened to your head?

64
00:06:27,398 --> 00:06:29,821
Went up for a dunk on the court and landed the wrong way.

65
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:32,631
-You play ball?
-Shooting gun.

66
00:06:33,597 --> 00:06:37,573
-Cool. More pancakes?
-Oh, thanks.

67
00:06:40,758 --> 00:06:43,143
You make a great blueberry pancake, Mrs. Trager.

68
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:47,191
They're Lori's favorite.
I make them every year to celebrate her birthday.

69
00:06:47,316 --> 00:06:49,572
Because we're so happy she was born.

70
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:51,071
I'm ignoring you.

71
00:06:51,105 --> 00:06:52,120
Good move.

72
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:54,060
If your birthday means that you're one year older,

73
00:06:54,185 --> 00:06:56,733
Doesn't that mean we're celebrating
one year closer to death?

74
00:06:56,938 --> 00:06:58,952
Well, guess that's one way to look at it.

75
00:06:59,055 --> 00:07:00,448
I think I just lost my appetite.

76
00:07:00,448 --> 00:07:04,717
Don't worry, Lori.
The average lifespan for the American woman is 79.2 years.

77
00:07:04,717 --> 00:07:09,480
If you were Japanese, you would have a few more years, but it's still not so bad.

78
00:07:09,945 --> 00:07:12,250
Whose idea was it to let him read the encyclopedia?

79
00:07:12,305 --> 00:07:15,082
Hey, we should bring out Lori's baby pictures,

80
00:07:15,277 --> 00:07:17,326
Reminisce over the awkward years.

81
00:07:17,326 --> 00:07:18,970
At least I'm out of mine.

82
00:07:19,735 --> 00:07:24,970
Birthdays. Baby pictures. Blueberry pancakes.

83
00:07:26,018 --> 00:07:30,831
They were talking about memories and traditions, but I had none of my own.

84
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:32,961
You gonna eat that or what?

85
00:07:34,616 --> 00:07:36,041
Kyle, everything okay?

86
00:07:38,145 --> 00:07:38,973
I'm fine.

87
00:07:50,866 --> 00:07:52,692
Seems like it will never end, doesn't it?

88
00:07:55,176 --> 00:07:56,390
3 more hours.

89
00:07:56,608 --> 00:07:57,453
You think?

90
00:07:59,905 --> 00:08:00,732
You know.

91
00:08:02,086 --> 00:08:05,263
It's easy for me to process data from global weather satellites.

92
00:08:06,167 --> 00:08:08,583
I just can't figure out why the rain triggers nightmares.

93
00:08:08,587 --> 00:08:10,738
-Are you having bad dreams?
-Last night.

94
00:08:10,738 --> 00:08:12,180
What was it about?

95
00:08:12,857 --> 00:08:13,901
I'm not sure.

96
00:08:14,046 --> 00:08:18,183
Well, don't dismiss it.
Every piece of information from your head counts.

97
00:08:18,436 --> 00:08:22,751
And dreams are a reflection of what's going on in our subconscious.

98
00:08:22,895 --> 00:08:24,675
-Where memories are stored.
-Exactly.

99
00:08:24,675 --> 00:08:27,183
The brain is a powerful tool--especially yours.

100
00:08:27,278 --> 00:08:29,960
And yet it can't tell me something as simple as my own birthday.

101
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,913
Well, that's something we'll fire out together.

102
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,622
The science of weather came easily to me.

103
00:08:48,326 --> 00:08:51,101
It was numbers, data, and patterns.

104
00:08:51,596 --> 00:08:56,830
What I couldn't figure out, no matter how hard I tried, was me.

105
00:09:08,947 --> 00:09:09,992
Where's Declan?

106
00:09:12,056 --> 00:09:13,851
Geeking out with Josh.

107
00:09:14,266 --> 00:09:17,311
Put a guy in front of a video game,
and there goes half his personality.

108
00:09:17,397 --> 00:09:21,492
Well, try growing up in the Pink Floyd era and replace video games with pot.

109
00:09:22,075 --> 00:09:23,752
It's so tedious.

110
00:09:25,057 --> 00:09:27,650
-You're baking?
-I bake.

111
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:28,770
You make.

112
00:09:29,586 --> 00:09:32,027
It's a special occasion, okay?
Cut me some slack.

113
00:09:32,027 --> 00:09:34,852
Okay. I'm just saying you don't have to bake a cake for me.

114
00:09:35,217 --> 00:09:36,990
Well, birthdays are all about cake.

115
00:09:37,365 --> 00:09:39,505
I guess I'm just not feeling the birthday thing.

116
00:09:39,505 --> 00:09:41,100
But you love your birthday.

117
00:09:42,246 --> 00:09:43,612
Not this year.

118
00:09:51,348 --> 00:09:54,900
So Kyle's just bummed out because he knows the aliens are on their way back to get him.

119
00:09:55,175 --> 00:09:56,021
It's the rain.

120
00:09:56,435 --> 00:09:59,310
They travel in lightning bolts, like in War of the Worlds.

121
00:09:59,325 --> 00:10:00,422
Cool it, Josh.

122
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:01,970
You got a better theory?

123
00:10:02,586 --> 00:10:05,522
Oh, ax guy in the corner. Get him!

124
00:10:05,526 --> 00:10:06,982
Oh, great. It's spreading.

125
00:10:07,205 --> 00:10:08,321
Hey, hon.

126
00:10:08,326 --> 00:10:10,362
Did you know Lori has decided to hate her birthday?

127
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,370
Does that mean we still have to suck up to her?

128
00:10:12,425 --> 00:10:14,552
Oh, 'cause you were doing such a good job.

129
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:16,420
Probably because she's in a fight with Hillary.

130
00:10:16,527 --> 00:10:17,970
She's in a fight with Hillary?

131
00:10:19,235 --> 00:10:21,040
Hey, Kyle, come on in. We'll play teams.

132
00:10:22,727 --> 00:10:23,791
Kyle, what's wrong?

133
00:10:27,985 --> 00:10:30,872
-Is this from your dream?
-I think it's a memory.

134
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:43,913
You saw him in your dream last night?

135
00:10:43,988 --> 00:10:45,873
And then again earlier, like a flash.

136
00:10:46,067 --> 00:10:47,680
But you don't recognize his face?

137
00:10:47,785 --> 00:10:49,176
No. He just popped into my head.

138
00:10:49,176 --> 00:10:50,483
But I checked the weather archives.

139
00:10:50,697 --> 00:10:53,723
The last major storm we had was the night before I woke up in the woods.

140
00:10:53,847 --> 00:10:55,466
Maybe this is a memory from then.

141
00:10:55,466 --> 00:10:57,041
It's definitely a possibility.

142
00:10:57,118 --> 00:11:00,092
No, I'm tired of possibilities.
I need something to be real.

143
00:11:00,188 --> 00:11:02,010
Well, that's the problem with amnesia.

144
00:11:02,082 --> 00:11:04,889
Your mind only unlocks information when it's ready.

145
00:11:04,952 --> 00:11:07,276
But there are other methods-- hypnosis, drugs.

146
00:11:07,276 --> 00:11:10,442
-You've been studying.
-I need to understand myself.

147
00:11:10,555 --> 00:11:12,412
I get it, Kyle. I do.

148
00:11:12,415 --> 00:11:18,013
And I promise you, if I believe there's
a viable alternative to the wait-and-see method, I'll give it a shot.

149
00:11:18,086 --> 00:11:21,213
But those kinds of aggressive therapies
can work against you.

150
00:11:21,246 --> 00:11:24,181
You just had what may have been your first memory.

151
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:27,241
I don't want to risk a setback.
Can you trust me on this?

152
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:35,530
The power line's down.

153
00:12:11,085 --> 00:12:12,060
What are you doing?

154
00:12:15,016 --> 00:12:15,732
Tom.

155
00:12:17,188 --> 00:12:21,993
Sorry to startle you, Mr. Trager.
There's a bunch of houses in the neighborhood that have lost power.

156
00:12:21,996 --> 00:12:24,955
I'm just doing the rounds, making sure
everybody's okay.

157
00:12:24,955 --> 00:12:26,222
Well, I'm really glad you're here.

158
00:12:26,227 --> 00:12:29,986
Our foster son Kyle drew a picture of someone staring in at him from the window.

159
00:12:29,986 --> 00:12:34,112
At first we thought it was his imagination, but now I'm not so sure.

160
00:12:39,165 --> 00:12:42,581
What if it's the same person that broke into the house last week?

161
00:12:42,745 --> 00:12:46,031
-You said something about that he drew a picture?
-Yeah.

162
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:47,541
I should probably look at that.

163
00:12:47,795 --> 00:12:49,881
-All right. It's inside.
-Yeah. Let's do that.

164
00:13:01,936 --> 00:13:03,472
I hear you're anti-birthday.

165
00:13:04,645 --> 00:13:06,373
Word travels fast.

166
00:13:11,617 --> 00:13:14,911
My last birthday, my dad couldn't be
bothered to be in town,

167
00:13:15,496 --> 00:13:17,902
So I raided the liquor cabinet in protest.

168
00:13:19,168 --> 00:13:21,021
At least you got blueberry pancakes.

169
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:22,580
Your favorite.

170
00:13:23,276 --> 00:13:25,210
Parents like me. What can I say?

171
00:13:29,206 --> 00:13:31,410
Seriously, what's your deal?

172
00:13:32,296 --> 00:13:35,312
I'm just feeling particularly friendless
right now.

173
00:13:35,885 --> 00:13:38,470
Makes celebrating another year of life sort of bleak.

174
00:13:39,148 --> 00:13:42,243
I'm your friend...kind of, I think.

175
00:13:42,835 --> 00:13:45,283
Yeah. After you duped me into losing my virginity?

176
00:13:45,318 --> 00:13:49,060
-I didn't dupe you.
-Please. Water, bridge.

177
00:14:03,266 --> 00:14:05,573
So, what really happened to your head?

178
00:14:06,185 --> 00:14:08,442
Seems like whoever asks gets a different story.

179
00:14:08,467 --> 00:14:09,871
I told you, I fell.

180
00:14:10,275 --> 00:14:13,153
Before or after your fight with your dad?

181
00:14:13,668 --> 00:14:15,003
Can we drop this, please?

182
00:14:17,778 --> 00:14:21,633
You know, my mom's a therapist.
I mean, you could--

183
00:14:21,645 --> 00:14:24,290
Trager, it's no big deal.
Seriously.

184
00:14:24,586 --> 00:14:27,651
No scandalous family drama, no horrible tales of abuse.

185
00:14:28,376 --> 00:14:30,031
Let it go. I'm fine.

186
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:51,640
Door!

187
00:15:04,757 --> 00:15:08,541
-Hi.
-Hi.

188
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:13,690
The power's out at my house, and I didn't want to be home alone, so I thought I'd come over here.

189
00:15:13,785 --> 00:15:15,963
-Where's Charlie?
-At his house.

190
00:15:16,086 --> 00:15:17,712
Why didn't you go over there?

191
00:15:18,656 --> 00:15:20,381
I guess I just wanted to come over here.

192
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,360
Josh said you remembered something.

193
00:15:31,935 --> 00:15:33,463
I still don't know what it means.

194
00:15:33,676 --> 00:15:35,031
Well, it'll come back to you.

195
00:15:36,737 --> 00:15:38,431
I'm beginning to wonder if it will.

196
00:15:41,095 --> 00:15:43,420
I think you should get out of the tub.
You're wallowing.

197
00:15:47,418 --> 00:15:52,023
"To indulge oneself immoderately,
as in wallowing in self-pity."

198
00:15:54,315 --> 00:15:55,822
I'm wallowing.

199
00:15:57,108 --> 00:15:58,823
It's depressing.

200
00:16:09,358 --> 00:16:11,941
-What are you doing?
-I'm gonna wallow with you.

201
00:16:19,787 --> 00:16:22,160
-This is strange.
-Yep.

202
00:16:32,156 --> 00:16:33,173
Here it is.

203
00:16:34,557 --> 00:16:38,415
That's a...
That's a lot of detail.

204
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:42,010
Yeah. You recognize him?

205
00:16:42,288 --> 00:16:45,280
No.
No. I've never seen him before.

206
00:16:48,896 --> 00:16:50,652
Did Kyle say when he saw him?

207
00:16:51,038 --> 00:16:53,561
No. He was pretty spooked by the whole thing.
He didn't say much.

208
00:16:53,718 --> 00:16:59,253
Okay. Uh...
I'll circula it at the security company,

209
00:16:59,437 --> 00:17:02,040
And I'll pass it over to the police
and maybe they can I.D. him.

210
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,381
Great. Thanks.
I really appreciate it.

211
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:06,483
No problem. Just doing my job.

212
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:10,990
-Did you give him the picture?
-Yeah.

213
00:17:12,256 --> 00:17:14,927
Poor Kyle.
He was so sure it was a memory and not a dream.

214
00:17:14,927 --> 00:17:16,171
I wish it was.

215
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:19,043
I don't like the idea of someone trying
to break into our house.

216
00:17:19,076 --> 00:17:22,213
It's strange that both times somebody tried to get into Kyle's room.

217
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:26,523
-Do you ever wonder if Kyle--
-What?

218
00:17:27,437 --> 00:17:29,251
No. No, it's ridiculous.

219
00:17:29,568 --> 00:17:32,483
After everything we've witnessed, nothing is ridiculous.

220
00:17:34,425 --> 00:17:35,751
No one's reported him missing,

221
00:17:36,048 --> 00:17:42,132
And he's capable of doing things that no normal child or no normal human being should be capable of.

222
00:17:43,278 --> 00:17:47,612
I'm not saying that I believe in Josh's crazy theories, but...

223
00:17:47,826 --> 00:17:48,823
But?

224
00:17:49,576 --> 00:17:51,801
Maybe he's not missing for a reason.

225
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:55,103
Maybe there's someone out there that knows exactly where he is.

226
00:17:56,555 --> 00:17:58,063
Maybe they're watching him.

227
00:17:59,225 --> 00:18:01,532
You mean like little green men?

228
00:18:02,988 --> 00:18:08,541
No. No, but, you know,
with all of this, it's so crazy.

229
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,613
It just kind of makes you wonder.

230
00:18:29,077 --> 00:18:31,061
-Yes?
-We've got a problem.

231
00:18:32,147 --> 00:18:33,711
He's starting to remember.

232
00:18:49,485 --> 00:18:50,481
Board games?

233
00:18:50,597 --> 00:18:53,711
Well, anything's better than sitting around dodging real conversation.

234
00:18:53,886 --> 00:18:56,002
-You went in my room?
-Get over it.

235
00:18:56,298 --> 00:18:58,151
Mystic Vision? I don't think so.

236
00:18:59,106 --> 00:19:00,441
Yeah. We don't want to play that.

237
00:19:01,268 --> 00:19:03,142
-What is it?
-It's a Ouija board.

238
00:19:03,315 --> 00:19:06,663
You ask it questions and supposedly the spirits spell out answers.

239
00:19:06,796 --> 00:19:10,033
When in reality, it's usually some idiot
moving the pointer around.

240
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:14,033
Well, we should do something.
This rain's not letting up anytime soon.

241
00:19:14,055 --> 00:19:18,403
Well, actually, it's letting up in 32 minutes, according to KZRE weather over here.

242
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,073
Not anymore. The wind shifted.

243
00:19:20,835 --> 00:19:22,633
-I bet did.
-Let's play.

244
00:19:22,855 --> 00:19:24,501
It's totally fake, Kyle.

245
00:19:24,665 --> 00:19:25,871
I don't care.

246
00:19:26,526 --> 00:19:28,851
No! Seriously, find another game.

247
00:19:28,978 --> 00:19:29,973
Josh!

248
00:19:36,695 --> 00:19:39,291
Looks like the spirits are total pervs.

249
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:41,752
One word, dude--internet.

250
00:19:43,776 --> 00:19:45,072
How do we start?

251
00:20:05,697 --> 00:20:06,610
Yeah?

252
00:20:07,128 --> 00:20:08,440
I'm hoping you have a plan.

253
00:20:12,095 --> 00:20:13,022
Are you still there?

254
00:20:13,275 --> 00:20:16,233
You ought to take an hour to stop the family from asking any more questions.

255
00:20:16,607 --> 00:20:17,480
Good.

256
00:20:17,946 --> 00:20:21,493
Because if his memories get any clearer,
the family's gonna become a problem.

257
00:20:25,115 --> 00:20:26,302
I'll take care of it.

258
00:20:36,195 --> 00:20:38,113
Okay. I'll go first.

259
00:20:39,456 --> 00:20:43,660
Who is the biggest queen bee bitch at Beachwood High?

260
00:20:47,258 --> 00:20:48,172
"L"...

261
00:20:53,315 --> 00:20:54,091
"O"...

262
00:20:55,456 --> 00:20:57,031
"R"...Josh!

263
00:20:57,067 --> 00:20:59,443
What can I say? The spirits speak the truth.

264
00:21:00,586 --> 00:21:02,630
Okay. My turn.

265
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:07,990
How badly am I going to destroy Declan's high score once the electricity comes back on?

266
00:21:08,078 --> 00:21:10,927
No spirit can help you with that, junior. You're toast.

267
00:21:10,927 --> 00:21:13,002
-Can I go next?
-Knock yourself out.

268
00:21:15,055 --> 00:21:16,412
When's my birthday?

269
00:21:17,336 --> 00:21:19,321
Kyle, you know this is just a game.

270
00:21:19,425 --> 00:21:20,733
For 12-year-olds.

271
00:21:21,756 --> 00:21:26,150
Hey, if anyone can get a Ouiji board to work, it's him.

272
00:21:26,386 --> 00:21:27,822
Just concentrate, Kyle.

273
00:21:49,447 --> 00:21:50,950
I don't--I don't think...

274
00:21:51,808 --> 00:21:53,132
Who's moving the pointer?

275
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:57,572
7...8...

276
00:22:04,068 --> 00:22:07,291
1...2...

277
00:22:07,295 --> 00:22:09,140
Ooh, I'm getting freaked out.

278
00:22:14,778 --> 00:22:15,930
2...

279
00:22:17,457 --> 00:22:18,491
7...

280
00:22:32,495 --> 00:22:34,901
7-8-1-2-2-7.

281
00:22:38,216 --> 00:22:43,170
-What does it mean?
-7-8-1-2-2-7.

282
00:22:44,386 --> 00:22:47,892
-You had to have been pushing it.
-Spelling out your alien birthday?

283
00:22:48,127 --> 00:22:49,130
I wasn't.

284
00:22:49,478 --> 00:22:52,112
-Well, you don't think you were.
-I wasn't.

285
00:22:52,217 --> 00:22:53,520
What is that?

286
00:22:53,927 --> 00:22:54,700
A Kyle file.

287
00:22:55,068 --> 00:22:59,342
I've documented every out-of-the-ordinary event and unusual behavior
ever since we got him.

288
00:23:00,326 --> 00:23:08,083
"Made...contact...with...spirit...world."

289
00:23:08,148 --> 00:23:10,552
Whoa, buddy! This is classified.

290
00:23:12,356 --> 00:23:14,501
This is ridiculous. He's not an alien.

291
00:23:14,946 --> 00:23:16,551
He's not even a good weatherman.

292
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:21,131
The rain? It stopped.

293
00:23:30,176 --> 00:23:31,602
This doesn't make any sense.

294
00:23:31,795 --> 00:23:35,420
Neither do any of the Chicken Little
conspiracy theories Josh has been spouting.

295
00:23:39,187 --> 00:23:40,975
You guys aren't seriously buying any of this?

296
00:23:40,975 --> 00:23:42,363
Kyle isn't supernatural.

297
00:23:42,665 --> 00:23:46,772
He's just some kid with no memory and annoying accurate knowledge of the encyclopedia.

298
00:23:46,796 --> 00:23:48,962
-You don't know that.
-It's just a game.

299
00:23:49,157 --> 00:23:51,393
There's no such thing as spirits or ghosts.

300
00:23:51,395 --> 00:23:52,693
When you're dead, you're dead.

301
00:23:53,048 --> 00:23:56,481
-Buried, rotting.
-Declan, shut up.

302
00:23:57,148 --> 00:23:59,311
-No. It's okay.
-No, it's not okay.

303
00:23:59,505 --> 00:24:04,033
Oh, God. Your dad.
I'm sorry.

304
00:24:05,218 --> 00:24:07,716
There was a sudden drop in the barometric pressure.

305
00:24:07,716 --> 00:24:10,872
The crackling rise of static electricity in the air,

306
00:24:11,138 --> 00:24:12,970
And the subtle smell of ozone.

307
00:24:14,628 --> 00:24:15,891
Get back inside, now!

308
00:24:15,897 --> 00:24:18,101
-What the hell are you talking about?
-Just come on!

309
00:24:27,725 --> 00:24:29,903
-That was weird.
-What was that?

310
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:33,351
Nothing. It was nothing.

311
00:24:35,235 --> 00:24:37,463
Hallelujah!
Ready to get your ass kicked?

312
00:24:37,836 --> 00:24:38,943
You wish.

313
00:24:42,906 --> 00:24:44,483
So, how's your day going?

314
00:24:45,687 --> 00:24:47,061
It's a fiesta.

315
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:50,492
-Kyle channeled a supernatural dimension.
-What?

316
00:24:50,995 --> 00:24:54,331
The Ouija board.
It spelled out some weird number for him.

317
00:24:54,715 --> 00:24:56,020
He was totally pushing it.

318
00:24:56,215 --> 00:25:02,390
Well, of course he was, but he may not realize he was doing it, in which case,
maybe it's another memory trying to claw its way out.

319
00:25:02,487 --> 00:25:04,371
Did he say he knew what the number meant?

320
00:25:05,075 --> 00:25:07,162
Of course not. That would be too easy.

321
00:25:07,785 --> 00:25:09,591
Well, I have to talk to him about it.

322
00:25:11,916 --> 00:25:13,733
He asked it when his birthday was.

323
00:25:13,867 --> 00:25:16,262
Yeah. He's having a really hard time with that today.

324
00:25:16,365 --> 00:25:20,872
Everyone's weird today--even Declan,
who's usually dependably unweird.

325
00:25:21,715 --> 00:25:24,001
So, what's going on with him?

326
00:25:24,348 --> 00:25:26,791
I don't know. He won't talk to me.

327
00:25:26,866 --> 00:25:29,232
And I haven't mastered the art of shrinking like you have.

328
00:25:29,735 --> 00:25:36,932
Well, sometimes the easiest way to get somebody to open up is to just be there for them without judgment when they're ready to spill.

329
00:25:38,005 --> 00:25:40,920
Yeah. See, that's the problem.
I live for judgment.

330
00:25:42,097 --> 00:25:44,761
You and Declan definitely seem to be getting closer.

331
00:25:45,608 --> 00:25:46,290
Ah, I guess.

332
00:25:46,768 --> 00:25:50,050
I guess you probably feel that you're ready for more.

333
00:25:50,086 --> 00:25:51,461
Physically, I mean.

334
00:25:55,575 --> 00:25:57,352
Are you shrinking me right now?

335
00:25:58,095 --> 00:26:01,640
Shrinking, moming, you know.
Whatever works.

336
00:26:02,765 --> 00:26:04,942
Stick to baking. It's less mortifying.

337
00:26:05,167 --> 00:26:07,852
Oh, you know, life can be mortifying sometimes.

338
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:11,033
And trust me, sometimes sex can be, too.

339
00:26:11,616 --> 00:26:15,857
That's a strain from the usual
"when 2 people love each her, they make beautiful magic" script.

340
00:26:15,857 --> 00:26:16,851
Well, that's true, too.

341
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:22,011
It's just that it doesn't always happen that way, especially if you
rush into things.

342
00:26:24,327 --> 00:26:25,621
You're right.

343
00:26:27,117 --> 00:26:29,222
-I am?
-I'm not ready.

344
00:26:48,736 --> 00:26:49,790
What'd you find?

345
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:54,312
9,734 hits for 7-8-1-2-2-7.

346
00:26:55,635 --> 00:26:58,600
Try "7-8-1-2-2-7" and "alien."

347
00:26:58,827 --> 00:27:00,062
That's not funny.

348
00:27:00,088 --> 00:27:02,093
How about "freaky meteorologist"?

349
00:27:02,737 --> 00:27:05,081
Try "7-8-1-2-2-7 birthday."

350
00:27:12,175 --> 00:27:13,051
Nothing.

351
00:27:13,126 --> 00:27:15,143
Doesn't matter. I've got the whole thing figured out.

352
00:27:16,145 --> 00:27:17,073
How?

353
00:27:18,408 --> 00:27:19,703
You sure you can handle it?

354
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:27,432
My theory is, you're an alien-human hybrid.

355
00:27:27,537 --> 00:27:31,241
The meta-geeks who created you put you here to be their lab rat.

356
00:27:31,485 --> 00:27:34,023
Maybe he's here to check the climate for its inhabitability?

357
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:36,991
-Yeah. That would explain the weather thing.
-Stop.

358
00:27:36,997 --> 00:27:40,386
Seriously, they're watching you interact
with us humans, taking notes,

359
00:27:40,386 --> 00:27:44,442
So they can wipe us out and replace us with a master race of hybrid freaks.

360
00:27:44,495 --> 00:27:47,736
Then, when they've done enough recon,
they'll beam down and take you away.

361
00:27:47,736 --> 00:27:50,003
-Please stop.
-Josh, I don't think you should--

362
00:27:50,008 --> 00:27:51,830
No, it's okay. 
Because here's the beauty of it--

363
00:27:51,908 --> 00:27:55,322
It's totally out of our hands,
and there's nothing we can do to change it.

364
00:27:55,326 --> 00:27:58,372
-So you just gotta go with the flow, you know?
-Josh!

365
00:27:59,338 --> 00:28:00,861
I don't want to hear any more!

366
00:28:02,498 --> 00:28:04,391
How is this supposed to make me feel?

367
00:28:07,557 --> 00:28:09,373
"Searches for alien mothership"?

368
00:28:10,507 --> 00:28:11,913
"Sleeps in the bathtub"?

369
00:28:13,447 --> 00:28:15,421
"Memorizes the encyclopedia."

370
00:28:16,696 --> 00:28:18,120
"Predicts lightning."

371
00:28:19,107 --> 00:28:20,481
This is fun for you?

372
00:28:20,625 --> 00:28:23,953
Everyone around here gets a kick out of it,
but this notebook...

373
00:28:25,118 --> 00:28:28,160
This is the only thing I know about my entire life!

374
00:28:29,437 --> 00:28:31,162
-Kyle--
-Mom, I didn't--

375
00:28:31,238 --> 00:28:34,293
I need you to go upstairs.
Please. All of you.

376
00:28:39,737 --> 00:28:41,662
No! I can't feel like this anymore!

377
00:28:42,228 --> 00:28:45,841
I don't want to be this freak in Josh's notebook.
I need to know who I am.

378
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:49,292
Kyle, I want you to listen to something, okay?

379
00:28:49,607 --> 00:28:50,832
Come on. Sit down.

380
00:28:55,426 --> 00:28:58,171
Just forget about everything else that you're feeling right now.

381
00:28:58,225 --> 00:29:00,612
And just listen to the sound of my voice.

382
00:29:02,947 --> 00:29:06,773
Now, find the rhythm of the other sounds
in the room.

383
00:29:08,637 --> 00:29:10,953
Listen to the water dripping off the gutter.

384
00:29:13,506 --> 00:29:15,182
Breathe into that sound.

385
00:29:18,068 --> 00:29:19,770
Let it fill you up.

386
00:29:21,817 --> 00:29:24,883
Let your mind and your heartbeat connect to it.

387
00:29:31,775 --> 00:29:32,571
Good.

388
00:29:37,247 --> 00:29:38,952
It's all gonna be okay.

389
00:30:05,196 --> 00:30:06,852
I am the scum of the earth.

390
00:30:07,478 --> 00:30:08,890
You're not scum.

391
00:30:09,448 --> 00:30:11,790
Maybe, like, algae.

392
00:30:11,828 --> 00:30:13,943
Nobody knew how much that stuff bugged him.

393
00:30:15,347 --> 00:30:19,671
Here I am today, whining because I'm not psyched about the way my life has turned out.

394
00:30:19,987 --> 00:30:22,527
And he's wishing he could remember the things he regrets.

395
00:30:22,527 --> 00:30:26,893
I've been upset about things that have happened to me in the past, but at least I have one, you know?

396
00:30:27,186 --> 00:30:28,710
He's just this total blank.

397
00:30:28,758 --> 00:30:30,352
It doesn't sound so bad to me today.

398
00:30:30,468 --> 00:30:33,880
But it feels bad.
Kyle feels bad.

399
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:36,591
It sucks.

400
00:30:44,035 --> 00:30:45,223
Come on in, Tom.

401
00:30:46,188 --> 00:30:48,641
I've got some information about your intruder.

402
00:30:50,906 --> 00:30:51,893
Hi there.

403
00:30:53,486 --> 00:30:55,202
How're you doing?

404
00:30:56,796 --> 00:30:57,930
I know you.

405
00:30:58,916 --> 00:31:01,383
Well, you probably recognize me from patrolling the neighborhood.

406
00:31:01,385 --> 00:31:03,120
-You said you had some news?
-Yeah.

407
00:31:03,306 --> 00:31:06,490
According to the police, there was a hit-and-run in the neighborhood around 2 a.m.

408
00:31:06,596 --> 00:31:08,878
No one was hurt, and it was probably
caused by the weather.

409
00:31:08,878 --> 00:31:13,630
And not reckless driving, but one of the drivers fled the scene, which is a crime, so...

410
00:31:13,715 --> 00:31:15,873
Why would he be lurking outside our house?

411
00:31:15,985 --> 00:31:17,832
Who was lurking outside our house?

412
00:31:18,007 --> 00:31:22,041
Well, we didn't want to worry you, Kyle,
but we found some blood on the sill outside your window.

413
00:31:22,108 --> 00:31:25,920
We think that man from your drawing must have actually been at your window.

414
00:31:28,745 --> 00:31:30,282
Hit-and-run?

415
00:31:31,058 --> 00:31:32,961
In my room, now.

416
00:31:37,006 --> 00:31:38,180
Okay. I panicked.

417
00:31:38,317 --> 00:31:42,893
I was on my way home, it was really hard to see, and I skidded and hit another car.

418
00:31:43,046 --> 00:31:45,171
I freaked out and drove off.

419
00:31:45,267 --> 00:31:48,511
The light, it was on in Kyle's room,
and he let me in.

420
00:31:48,576 --> 00:31:50,623
I couldn't go home. My dad would have murdered me.

421
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:55,857
I don't get you. Every time I think
you're a good guy, you do something to completely annihilate yrself!

422
00:31:55,857 --> 00:31:57,130
You think I don't know that?

423
00:31:57,157 --> 00:32:00,762
You can't honestly believe that I don't recognize I'm a total disaster of a person.

424
00:32:01,537 --> 00:32:02,770
I'm sorry.

425
00:32:03,228 --> 00:32:04,553
I'm judging.

426
00:32:05,218 --> 00:32:07,182
I get mad, and that's what I do.

427
00:32:09,545 --> 00:32:14,210
Look, I know we've had a lot of back and forth and...

428
00:32:14,637 --> 00:32:19,353
Played a lot of idiot games with each other, but you've been a really good
friend to me lately.

429
00:32:19,886 --> 00:32:24,960
And if you need someone to be that for you, I'm here.

430
00:32:26,096 --> 00:32:27,460
That's what I want you to know.

431
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:38,760
What do I do now?

432
00:32:40,376 --> 00:32:42,280
Depends on which guy you want to be.

433
00:32:44,737 --> 00:32:46,460
I have to turn myself in.

434
00:32:47,906 --> 00:32:49,122
I'm so dead.

435
00:32:49,995 --> 00:32:51,671
I'll visit you at county.

436
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:55,533
-You don't really think--
-No. You'll be fine.

437
00:32:55,955 --> 00:33:01,521
And it's the right thing to do,
so you can go home and pat yourself on the back for not being totally unredeemable.

438
00:33:03,405 --> 00:33:06,101
This friendship thing might work out okay, huh, Trager?

439
00:33:06,668 --> 00:33:09,611
Sure, McDunaugh.

440
00:33:12,715 --> 00:33:13,812
Spring cleaning?

441
00:33:14,897 --> 00:33:17,312
I don't want to be reminded of what I can't remember.

442
00:33:19,515 --> 00:33:21,311
See, I think you've got this all wrong.

443
00:33:22,975 --> 00:33:23,953
You do?

444
00:33:25,098 --> 00:33:28,802
Yeah. You may not have anything to hold onto right now,

445
00:33:28,816 --> 00:33:31,352
But maybe tomorrow, there'll be a new memory.

446
00:33:31,527 --> 00:33:33,140
And the day after that, another one.

447
00:33:33,698 --> 00:33:35,170
And soon, you'll be drowning in them.

448
00:33:39,895 --> 00:33:40,710
Maybe.

449
00:33:42,567 --> 00:33:44,261
But see, the rest of us.

450
00:33:44,558 --> 00:33:46,942
As we grow up, our memories get dimmer.

451
00:33:47,097 --> 00:33:50,372
And we try anything we can to stop them from disappearing completely.

452
00:33:50,636 --> 00:33:52,262
If you ask me, you got the better deal.

453
00:33:55,088 --> 00:33:55,980
Thank you.

454
00:33:57,786 --> 00:33:58,807
For what?

455
00:33:58,807 --> 00:34:00,480
For making me feel better.

456
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:05,360
You make me feel like there's hope.

457
00:34:07,466 --> 00:34:08,791
Everyone needs hope.

458
00:34:09,196 --> 00:34:10,932
It's what gets us through the rough spots.

459
00:34:13,996 --> 00:34:15,471
Will you tell me about him?

460
00:34:16,766 --> 00:34:18,912
-Who?
-Your dad.

461
00:34:21,347 --> 00:34:22,310
Sure.

462
00:34:23,577 --> 00:34:24,680
But not here.

463
00:34:26,857 --> 00:34:27,730
In here.

464
00:34:29,648 --> 00:34:31,053
Wallow Central.

465
00:34:38,895 --> 00:34:41,620
First off, he was nothing like my mother.

466
00:34:42,865 --> 00:34:45,802
But she was fferent around him.
I mean, it was impossible not to be...

467
00:34:46,095 --> 00:34:47,950
Lighter, happier.

468
00:34:48,876 --> 00:34:51,700
I remember this one time, he took me to get my ears pierced...

469
00:34:51,987 --> 00:34:54,962
So, Kyle doesn't have a serial stalker.

470
00:34:55,008 --> 00:34:57,371
Or little green men watching over him.

471
00:34:57,536 --> 00:35:00,381
Just a teenage boy, afraid to tell his dad what he did.

472
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:03,900
Yeah.
By the way, Lori's not a virgin anymore.

473
00:35:06,286 --> 00:35:08,240
You segue to that?

474
00:35:08,296 --> 00:35:10,205
Thought I'd rip the bandage off quickly.

475
00:35:10,205 --> 00:35:12,801
-Did she tell you?
-No. Of course not.

476
00:35:12,806 --> 00:35:17,070
But I was talking to her about not being ready for sex yet, and she agreed with me.

477
00:35:17,077 --> 00:35:20,390
Oh! Man, I am not ready for this!

478
00:35:23,717 --> 00:35:25,101
It's Declan.

479
00:35:25,386 --> 00:35:27,027
That car-wrecking, home-invading--

480
00:35:27,027 --> 00:35:28,083
-Stephen!
-I'm gonna kill him.

481
00:35:28,276 --> 00:35:31,540
You slept with Shelly Peterson when you weren't much older than Josh.

482
00:35:31,966 --> 00:35:36,236
You are not allowed to use something I said after 10 tequila shots on our honeymoon against me.

483
00:35:36,236 --> 00:35:37,800
Did it screw you up for life?

484
00:35:38,306 --> 00:35:39,841
That's not fair. It's different for girls.

485
00:35:43,507 --> 00:35:45,622
-Isn't it?
-I think she's fine.

486
00:35:45,848 --> 00:35:48,672
You know, talking to her earlier,
there's something there, like...

487
00:35:48,807 --> 00:35:53,021
I don't know. Whatever she's experienced
has made her more together.

488
00:35:54,347 --> 00:35:55,733
She's growing up.

489
00:35:59,697 --> 00:36:01,742
We don't have to worry about Josh, do we?

490
00:36:02,145 --> 00:36:04,567
Josh still stashes porn in his board games.

491
00:36:04,567 --> 00:36:08,013
He's not up to being anywhere close to being sexually active.

492
00:36:10,988 --> 00:36:17,753
Hey, if Declan was the person at the window,
who's the man in Kyle's drawings?

493
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:22,523
The police station's gonna be a party
compared to what I got coming to me at home.

494
00:36:22,945 --> 00:36:25,620
Well, here's one from the Parental Manipulation Handbook--

495
00:36:25,625 --> 00:36:30,816
Just apologize, cry a little, throw out a few self-loathing comments.

496
00:36:30,816 --> 00:36:32,780
He'll end up trying to make you feel better.

497
00:36:36,658 --> 00:36:39,500
You know what you said earlier about me duping you into having sex?

498
00:36:39,506 --> 00:36:41,616
You know, it's really not a big deal.

499
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:42,712
It is.

500
00:36:43,445 --> 00:36:46,381
You should know that no matter what Hillary said to give me the push.

501
00:36:46,798 --> 00:36:49,130
She made me realize I was about to lose you.

502
00:36:49,937 --> 00:36:51,581
That's why I asked you out.

503
00:36:52,086 --> 00:36:53,600
Because I wanted to.

504
00:36:56,217 --> 00:36:57,432
Thank you for that.

505
00:36:58,387 --> 00:37:00,701
It's a shame that it sucked so bad.

506
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:03,941
Goodbye.

507
00:37:22,797 --> 00:37:24,273
Happy birthday, Lori.

508
00:37:35,017 --> 00:37:36,000
How are you feeling?

509
00:37:37,538 --> 00:37:38,332
Better.

510
00:37:38,865 --> 00:37:40,993
Lori told me about the number you discovered.

511
00:37:41,865 --> 00:37:43,603
7-8-1-2-2-7.

512
00:37:44,115 --> 00:37:45,402
You want to talk about it?

513
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:49,720
Tomorrow.

514
00:37:51,206 --> 00:37:53,342
-Can I help?
-Sure.

515
00:37:53,707 --> 00:37:55,162
I'll go gather everybody.

516
00:38:04,948 --> 00:38:06,210
I'm not mad at you.

517
00:38:07,306 --> 00:38:08,233
Thank God.

518
00:38:14,055 --> 00:38:18,980
Look, if you're gonna be part of this family, you've got to understand all the traditions.

519
00:38:28,048 --> 00:38:29,151
Okay.

520
00:38:30,888 --> 00:38:32,842
Here we go.

521
00:38:33,307 --> 00:38:34,682
1, 2--

522
00:38:34,685 --> 00:38:35,922
No! Wait, wait!

523
00:38:36,705 --> 00:38:39,772
I was thinking, if it's okay with Kyle.

524
00:38:40,647 --> 00:38:42,663
I want to share my birthday with you.

525
00:38:43,867 --> 00:38:46,503
At least until you remember when your real birthday is.

526
00:38:48,757 --> 00:38:49,502
Thank you.

527
00:38:52,548 --> 00:38:54,636
Come here. You can help me blow out the candles and make a wish.

528
00:38:54,636 --> 00:38:56,802
He could wish to age better than Lori.

529
00:39:01,967 --> 00:39:04,613
Do you know what you're gonna wish for?
Don't say it out loud or it won't come true.

530
00:39:05,785 --> 00:39:07,610
It's another birthday tradition.

531
00:39:08,445 --> 00:39:10,201
That doesn't make any sense.

532
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:12,363
You're right. Screw it.
What do you wish for?

533
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:22,912
I think I'll keep with the tradition.

534
00:39:23,168 --> 00:39:25,292
Okay. Let's do it.

535
00:39:30,886 --> 00:39:33,970
Josh!
It never gets old, does it?

536
00:39:35,046 --> 00:39:38,730
With a flash of the camera, the Tragers gave me the first page of my history.

537
00:39:39,227 --> 00:39:42,041
It may not go back as far as Lori's or Josh's.

538
00:39:42,577 --> 00:39:44,533
But I finally have a beginning.

539
00:39:45,715 --> 00:39:47,873
And then my birthday wish came true.

540
00:39:48,508 --> 00:39:52,581
It made me feel like anything, anything was possible.

541
00:40:06,298 --> 00:40:07,742
What does the forecast say?

542
00:40:08,495 --> 00:40:10,621
"Sunny, in the 60s through Tuesday."

543
00:40:10,846 --> 00:40:11,530
Rain.

544
00:40:15,247 --> 00:40:16,121
Damn.

545
00:40:27,688 --> 00:40:28,873
Kyle, what's wrong?

546
00:40:31,268 --> 00:40:32,351
That's him.

547
00:41:01,086 --> 00:41:05,071
Detective, there's a Nicole Trager on the phone for you.

548
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,790
-Put her through.
-Yes, sir.

549
00:41:08,875 --> 00:41:12,392
Mrs. Trager, what can we do for you?
