1
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,868
Cousin, I'm home.

2
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,674
Any calls?

3
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,476
Soldier, where is your weapon?

4
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,395
Did you hear me?

5
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,350
I said where is that weapon, soldier?

6
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,351
You are puke.

7
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,518
You are a maggot.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,798
You are the lowest form of life.

9
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,390
Now...

10
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,075
...if I ever catch you again without that
weapon strapped firmly to your chest,

11
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,999
I will snatch you up by your
stacking Swivel,

12
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,557
and commence field stripping.
Do I make myself clear?

13
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,114
Oh, you quit drinking,
that's right, I forgot.

14
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,475
It's August...

15
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,309
...and I've been making some
observations...

16
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,516
...about what's going on out there...

17
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,112
...in the corn...

18
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,752
...and I think that...

19
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,114
...that...

20
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,357
Dammit. Who turned the video
camera on again?

21
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,596
Cousin,

22
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,635
how many times do I have to tell you...

23
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,950
not to play with the expensive
video equipment.

24
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,272
You want reality. I am reality.

25
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,071
What reality needs right about now
there, Cousin,

26
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,157
is some more rounds.

27
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,074
That's what I need: more rounds.

28
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,678
When I was outside there if I...

29
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,391
...had more rounds...

30
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,794
...and ten more divisions of these men...

31
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,679
...our troubles would be over here
very quickly.

32
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,035
Damn it!

33
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,157
Cover me, cousin. I'm going in.

34
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,556
You little bastard.

35
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,278
Cousin, he's broken out of the attic.

36
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,677
Padre, go flank him around back.

37
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,598
What are you looking at?

38
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,033
Shit.

39
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,112
Dummy? Next time wear your seat belt.

40
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,239
Get it? Crash test dummy.

41
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,875
I got you now, you son of a...

42
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:49,950
Hey.

43
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,679
-So...
-What's up, man?

44
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,838
-So?
-So, I am now officially...

45
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,797
...a degreed electrical engineer.

46
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,272
-Whatever that means.
-Hey, man, we all made it.

47
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,512
-Four years of this shit.
-Yeah, it's just I don't know.

48
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,318
I thought I would feel different,
you know.

49
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,352
-So, where's Stephen?
-He should be here.

50
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,873
Well you know how he is.

51
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,949
Hey, what's wrong?

52
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,635
Nothing, you know.

53
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,157
Are you still upset about
missing graduation?

54
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,511
Nah. You know me with all of that
ceremonial crap...

55
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,836
I mean, I wanted to be there
with you, but...

56
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,991
-...with the funeral and all...
-Yeah.

57
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,912
I'm sorry about your cousin.

58
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,794
Yeah. Just, you know, it was somebody
I really wanted you to meet.

59
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,711
Macy, what, did you pack to
go to the Andes or something?

60
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,948
That's Maurice's crap, smartass.
I have one bag.

61
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,956
Smooth. Very smooth.

62
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,355
Y'all need a lift?

63
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,315
Hi!

64
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,710
Hey man!

65
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,875
-Hey, what's up!
-How're you doing?

66
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,308
-It's good to see you.
-You too.

67
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,198
-This is Iris.
-Hey, how are ya?

68
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,277
-You know Layne. This is Macy.
-Hi!

69
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,118
You all know Katrina...

70
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,356
-Hi Stephen!
-Hey, ladies!

71
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,548
This is... Maurice.

72
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,558
-Maurice Hall.
-Hi.

73
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,558
Have I seen you around
campus before?

74
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,474
No. I'm taking some time off,
figuring some stuff out.

75
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,517
Yeah, yeah, been there.

76
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,876
Sorry, I know I've seen
you somewhere.

77
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:52,990
I doubt it.

78
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,831
Smooth. Real smooth...

79
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,630
Shotgun!

80
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,030
I already called it, hotshot.

81
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,433
Other side.

82
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:33,552
Hey, guys, thank you for helping
me out. I really appreciate it.

83
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,678
It's gonna be kind of tough going
back there and stuff but...

84
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,038
-...thanks.
-Hey, no problem. I love the country.

85
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,832
Yeah. We're glad to help.

86
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,839
Are there gonna be cows?

87
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,911
-What?
-No, there's not gonna be cows.

88
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,438
-Not on this farm.
-I've never seen a cow...

89
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,998
Hey, it's Highway six, right?

90
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,316
Yeah, you're gonna be coming up
to a split off in the road pretty soon.

91
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,433
Take that and then we just need to stop
in town real quick.

92
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,035
Which town?

93
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,076
Porterville.

94
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,674
Porterville?

95
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,039
Yes, that is my hometown.

96
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,269
You still have relatives there?

97
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,479
No. The sheriff and my
cousin were close.

98
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,831
He's actually been the guy
who's taking care of...

99
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,758
...the estate since the accident and stuff.

100
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,679
So, what are you going to do
with the place after we fix it up?

101
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,232
Sell it. Buy a new place in the city,
or something.

102
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,594
So, what happened?

103
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,235
With your cousin, I mean?

104
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,911
I am not too sure, the sheriff said
something about...

105
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,793
...an accident with his truck or something.

106
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,115
Sounds awful.

107
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,119
-He didn't have any family?
-He was...you know...

108
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,675
...Ioner type of guy. Kinda
kept to himself.

109
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:47,037
I can't even imagine that. Dying alone...

110
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,909
Tell me about it.

111
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,436
What? Huh!
Oh, ok.

112
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,789
-God...
-Hey man, how much longer?

113
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,153
-We're close to Porterville.
-You don't have to shout. I can hear you.

114
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:40,276
We're close to Porterville, but we're
about twenty miles away from the farm.

115
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,708
When was the last time
you were up here?

116
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,909
Oh Jesus,

117
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,118
it's been a few years, you know. We used
to always come up here when I was a kid.

118
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,153
My dad, I don't know, thought
it "built character" or something.

119
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,472
Yeah, you're dad was wrong.

120
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,430
You ain't got no character.

121
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,508
You aint got no character.

122
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,554
-You don't got character,
-It's funny.

123
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,271
I'm just saying you aint got no
character man, I'm serious!

124
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,637
This country is cool, right man?

125
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,436
Wow, this place is amazing!

126
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,232
What do they do for fun in this place?

127
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,119
-Play checkers?
-Hey, I think it's kind of cute, alright?

128
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,193
You guys are funny.
Quick little tour, alright?

129
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,914
The hardware store is right down
that street...

130
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,834
...and the one and only
Don's Grocery's is right over here.

131
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,917
-Knock yourself out.
-Alrighty!

132
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,833
This is great

133
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,919
I got my hopes all high...
Goodness Gracious...Who is this guy?

134
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,949
Whatever!

135
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,670
-Hey!
-Yo!

136
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,872
-So, this is where you grew up.
-Yes, this is Porterville.

137
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,795
-Oh, the Pumpkin Festival!
-Oh, yeah, Pumpkin Festival.

138
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,035
Oh, my gosh!

139
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,834
I actually got my hand stuck
in a pumpkin once.

140
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:09,950
Did you really?

141
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,232
Yeah. I actually was the reigning
champion before I left.

142
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,793
-Oh, you were.
-I was.

143
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,594
-I expect nothing less...
-Come on, man!

144
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,439
Things move a little slower up
here in Porterville.

145
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,789
Got ya!

146
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,072
-Thank you
-Welcome

147
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,910
Hello!

148
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:34,910
Bill?

149
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,228
Watch!

150
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,990
I'm Sheriff Barney Fife.
Welcome to Mayberry.

151
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,833
That's not funny.

152
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,635
Barney was the deputy, and not
the sheriff, you know?

153
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,149
-Layne!
-Sheriff!

154
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,593
Yeah, I know. Takes a little
getting used to, don't it?

155
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,437
Hello!

156
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,949
-Hi. Macy Reed.
-Pleasure. Please, sit down.

157
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,916
I tried calling you yesterday, but I
couldn't get through for some reason.

158
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,998
Yeah, the utility poles north of town
have been going down lately.

159
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,751
Listen Layne, I'm really sorry about Joe.

160
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,834
Thanks. You guys were pretty close too.

161
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,315
Yes, we were.

162
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,311
Is that the young lady your mom
was telling me about?

163
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,594
Yeah, probably.

164
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,430
-Moms are like that, huh?
-Yeah

165
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,949
Alright, you've got keys.

166
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,829
-Oh, thanks.
-And the security code.

167
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,035
Security code?

168
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,549
Yeah, Joe had a system put in
not too long ago.

169
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,191
I don't know how many times
that damn thing went off!

170
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,515
I had to go out there all the time.

171
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,510
I'm sure he was just setting it off himself,
hates to drink alone.

172
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,949
Sounds like Joe.

173
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,279
So, what, I just... um?

174
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,948
You hit the "pound" sign and the
five digit code.

175
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,399
Well, listen, I think we are all pretty
beat, hungry...

176
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,231
-Yeah.
-Yeah, sure.

177
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,072
...so, we're gonna head off to the house.

178
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,635
Hey, take them to Lillie's.
They do good burgers.

179
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,195
-Have fun. Be careful out there.
-Nice to meet you.

180
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,150
Pleasure.

181
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,632
You all come back now, you hear?

182
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,789
Oh, shit...

183
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,755
What was that?

184
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,439
Did you see the way they looked
at us in there?

185
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,232
-Yeah.
-I thought it was because I was...

186
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,510
...you know, sexy, handsome...

187
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,077
Come on, man, that's a small town
mentality, you know?

188
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,838
You just got to roll with the punches up here.

189
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,235
Nah. Everybody was all smiles
until we mentioned your cousin.

190
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,032
Yeah. I don't think he was a
popular guy.

191
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,118
Well, he was a bit of a boozer,
a bit of a wild man.

192
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:39,313
-Oh, so I guess that runs in the family.
-Oh, yeah...

193
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,029
-Oh, man...
-What's up with the corn?

194
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,512
-Looks bad...
-He died before the harvest.

195
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,234
What a busted ass piece of sh...

196
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,430
What was that?

197
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,073
That's wind.

198
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,839
It got cold, all of the sudden...

199
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,796
Ouch! Shit!
Damn! It's not funny.

200
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,877
Must be a hundred volts running
through that.

201
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,435
It's not the volts, man, it's the amps.

202
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,113
What's up with the fence?
And all that crap?

203
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,076
I don't know. It wasn't here before.

204
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,434
-Oh my gosh!
-Oh my god!

205
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,868
Oh! Goodness!

206
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,109
-Oh no!
-This house needs a pot pourri.

207
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,799
This is nasty!

208
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,112
Yeah, he needed an alarm and an
electrical fence for this shit!

209
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,835
Guys, I don't know how he
let it get like this.

210
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,874
I mean... I'm really sorry.
Really.

211
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,878
There's two big windows upstairs,
you guys can go open up.

212
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,878
You guys can open the one
in the kitchen.

213
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,433
-Yeah!
-...and I'll start this up.

214
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,508
Oh, god!

215
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,039
Oh, my god.

216
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,313
I'm gonna regret this.

217
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,999
I'm not touching that.

218
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,715
No

219
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,668
I don't get it.

220
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,471
Jesus Christ!

221
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,235
I don't get it.

222
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,759
Doesn't make any sense?

223
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,436
Why don't I go unload the car?

224
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,116
Ok?

225
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,435
I don't get it.

226
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,237
This is not funny.

227
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:58,634
-I give up. I give up.
-You know, someday...someday,

228
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,598
-I am going to teach you how to cook.
-I can cook.

229
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,389
-No, you can't.
-Yes, I can.

230
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,353
Yeah, you can do it in the microwave...
Maybe.

231
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,199
You know what? Fine. I will
just have to become a tremendously...

232
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,597
...successful archaeologist,
and have a cook.

233
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,109
Oh, yeah?
The words, "tremendously successful"

234
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,676
and "archaeologist" are sort of...
mutually exclusive, aren't they?

235
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,749
So, you aint gonna be able
to afford a cook...

236
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,078
Yes, I will. I also intend on
having maids...

237
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,357
...because I will never clean
a mess like this...

238
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,630
-...ever again.
-I'm sorry.

239
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,158
-I didn't want you to spend your last month...
-I'm kidding.

240
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,953
You know there's nothing I'd
rather be doing...

241
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,038
...or anyone I'd rather be with.

242
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,558
-I mean...
-What?

243
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,473
We've talked about this, ok? I can't.

244
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,314
-I have to concentrate on school right now.
-I know.

245
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,876
-I'm leaving!
-Macy, Macy, Macy...

246
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:04,038
The distance, it doesn't bother me.
I already told you that.

247
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,509
I love you.

248
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,314
Guys, you have to come see this!
Right now.

249
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,630
-What?
-You have to check this out.

250
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,875
Jesus!

251
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,190
Guys, guys, come on, I don't think
we should go in there.

252
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,277
-Come on!
-You've gotta see this.

253
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,873
Come on, come on, come on.

254
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,515
See? I told you.

255
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,479
Wow!

256
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,513
Have you ever seen one
of these before?

257
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,630
No.

258
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,476
I wonder what this looks like
from the air.

259
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,396
Pretty weird, huh?

260
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,676
-Smells funny. Like rain.
-Yeah, like... like electricity.

261
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,070
Yeah, it's actually ozone.
After a big electrical storm...

262
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,599
...in the country,
that's what it smells like out here.

263
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,836
Hey, this thing is surrounded
with police tape, isn't it?

264
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,356
Yeah, what's up with that?

265
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,388
Well, it's obviously where Joe... died,

266
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,993
...except the Sheriff never mentioned
anything about this.

267
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,518
It gives me the creeps.
Can we go in now?

268
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,473
Stop it! No!

269
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,234
Ok, ok, ok...

270
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,318
Just massage me!

271
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,034
Ok, I'll massage you.
I'm gonna massage you and be serious.

272
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,472
I'm serious. Just massage.
I had no idea cleaning could be so hard.

273
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,795
That's because you've
never done it before.

274
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,672
Oh, you're so full of it.

275
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,830
Lower!

276
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,718
You know, This would be a lot easier
if you took this off.

277
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,878
I'm so sure!

278
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,317
If I take my shirt off, there's no way
you are gonna finish my massage.

279
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,431
I will. I promise.

280
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,197
I don't like it when it's
so bright in here.

281
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,196
Why?

282
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,908
You know why.

283
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:59,714
Katrina, you are a beautiful girl.

284
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,398
You have a beautiful body.

285
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:06,593
I just don't know why you are not
with a cheerleader type.

286
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,915
That's bullshit!

287
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,038
Why are you with me?

288
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,311
Katrina, I love you.

289
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,792
I love your body.

290
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,514
That's the truth.

291
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:29,948
Hey, hey, come here...

292
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,109
What the hell was that?

293
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,468
Hi hot stuff!

294
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,796
-You guys are having fun down there.
-What's up? Are you having any problems?

295
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,797
-We thought that was you guys.
-No, that wasn't us.

296
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,153
-I'm serious!
-Right!

297
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,439
-What is that?
-That!

298
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,359
Nah, it's just rats. Just rats up there,
knocking stuff over.

299
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,629
No, no, no, that sounds like
somebody on the roof.

300
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,630
That's not a rat.

301
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,234
Guys, listen, I set the alarm, if anyone
was out there, we...

302
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,149
Oh, god!

303
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,511
-What is it?
-I don't see anything.

304
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,310
I'm telling you guys, it's probably
just an animal,

305
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,755
-a raccoon or a possum or something.
-Oh my god!

306
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:17,950
What?

307
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,594
-It's another one.
-Another what?

308
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,789
Another circle in the corn.

309
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,948
Smartass pieces of shit!

310
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,277
You country people need to get a life!

311
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,153
Really funny prank,
I'm so not impressed.

312
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,517
Guys, I don't think this is a prank.

313
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,392
How long do you think it would take
someone to do this?

314
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,036
I don't know. I mean, this is a pretty damn
good crop circle right here.

315
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,110
Obviously, depends on how many
people in the group...

316
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,878
Who said anything about people?

317
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,997
Well, someone had to say it,
sooner or later.

318
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,914
Guys, crop circle do not just
appear out of anywhere.

319
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,030
-Baby...
-I'm serious.

320
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,468
No! Listen to me, guys.

321
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,954
Do you know how long it would
take to do this?

322
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,388
-It just appeared over night.
-Baby, come on baby.

323
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:12,479
This is the country, alright?
People have a lot of spare time up here.

324
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,074
-Hey, wait up!
-Yo, Maurice, you wanna take a walk?

325
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,032
-Yeah.
-Alright.

326
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,471
Excuse me!

327
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,517
You're not leaving me in the middle
of this crop circle by myself.

328
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,116
Break it down, it's all about the nuggets.

329
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,630
I'm just gonna put these up in the attic.
I'll meet you on the roof in a few.

330
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,670
Alrighty.

331
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,190
Damn it!!

332
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,709
What...

333
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,948
What's this?

334
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,269
-Oh, Jesus!
-Hey, man, you okay?

335
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,356
Oh, man!

336
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,596
-You scared the crap out of me.
-Sorry.

337
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,598
You should've seen
the look on your face though.

338
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,399
Hey, what's those tapes?

339
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,278
I don't know.
I just found them up here.

340
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,999
We finished doing some stuff
in the backyard.

341
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,428
We were wondering if we could get
a little down time.

342
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,710
-Definitely. That's fine.
-Thanks, man.

343
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,676
Yeah, well he's cousin Joe.

344
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,069
It was then when I began
to suspect that...

345
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,239
...something was going on
out there in the corn.

346
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:45,319
I'll tell you, they are not
from this world.

347
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,560
First, I thought them circles
out there in the corn...

348
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,234
...was just them creatures trying
to have some fun.

349
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:00,798
But now I realize it's some kind
of portal system.

350
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,597
See I got it figured out.

351
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,952
They're planning some kind of invasion.

352
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,873
Guess what?

353
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,711
I figured something out.

354
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:28,875
I started putting
iron around the house...

355
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,319
...keeps those little bastards at bay.

356
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,559
Ho, ho, ho.....ho, ho.

357
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,395
Guess what? I got one of them.

358
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,958
With my shotgun.

359
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:59,876
Didn't hardly stop him though,
'till he ran into my electrical fence.

360
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,795
I cut his freaking arm off.

361
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,710
Damn it! Who turned on this
video camera?

362
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,358
-Two guys up in Alaska, right?
-Yeah.

363
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,357
-Fishing. Bored out of their...
-This, this, this, this.

364
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,278
-I'm sorry.
-Go ahead.

365
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,994
-Bored out of their minds.
-Yeah.

366
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,949
One guy says to the other guy:
"Let's play a game."

367
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,959
And he says: "What kind of game do
you wanna play?"

368
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,749
-He says: "Well, you know..."

369
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,951
-Here grab the...
-Hey, Layne...

370
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,875
What is that?

371
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,835
-What the hell is that?
-Damn, what is that?

372
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,712
Hey, guys! Come check this out!

373
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:07,996
What's up?

374
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,917
-Is that a plane?
-It's to low for a plane.

375
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,829
Holy crap!

376
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,512
It's coming right toward us!
It's coming right through the corn field!

377
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,153
-Oh my god!
-I don't like this.

378
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:35,116
It's okay... It's one of them.

379
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,193
Hey! Y'all seen any aliens?

380
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,310
You motherf...

381
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,508
Stupid rednecks!

382
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,754
Fuck!

383
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:01,114
What a wonderful hometown
you have, Layne.

384
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,231
Yeah, they gonna come burn
a cross for an encore?

385
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,555
Not while I'm around...

386
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,629
At least we know who's
making the damned crop circles.

387
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,480
Yeah? I wouldn't be so sure...

388
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,998
I'll talk to the Sheriff tomorrow.

389
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,551
Not too many people have
a truck like that.

390
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,557
Hell, Layne, I thought they all
had trucks like that...

391
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,875
Yes, it is.

392
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:42,316
It's a tragedy, Mrs. Sanders.
I know. I have...

393
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,999
I have dogs, too.

394
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,353
I will. I...
As soon as I can.

395
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,948
Yes, ma'am.

396
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,758
Missing dogs.

397
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,473
I'd hate to keep them chained up too,
but what can you do?

398
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,234
What can I do for you?

399
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:04,677
Ah, yesterday evening, some guys
in a monster truck were...

400
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,474
-...tearing-ass through my corn field.
-Craig Burton.

401
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,798
Did he have a longhaired
kid with him?

402
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,915
-Yeah, he did actually.
-Lance Wallace.

403
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,718
You want to file a complaint?

404
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,512
You know what, he didn't really
hurt anything,

405
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,392
just more or less pissed me off.

406
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,749
Almost had some police work there.

407
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,951
I'll have a talk with them.

408
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,752
Anything else I can do?

409
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,155
Yes, something else is
bothering me, sherriff.

410
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:36,109
The other night, my friends and I
were in the field and...

411
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,232
-...we found something.
-The circle.

412
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,156
Yeah.

413
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,038
But there was a new one
the night before last.

414
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,276
-New one?
-Bigger than the old one.

415
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,510
Look, I know it's probably just the guys
messing around in the truck and all, but...

416
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,399
No. It's not their style.
They are not creative types.

417
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,957
They probably failed geometry too.

418
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:57,397
Well, whatever it is, it's just freaking
some of my friends out.

419
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,551
Tell them to relax.
You know, I mean.

420
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:03,317
Look, local kids they like to
blow off some steam,

421
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:07,991
you know tip cows, climb water towers,
you know better than anybody.

422
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,351
Like a circle in the corn
don't mean jack.

423
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,999
Then why did you tape it off?

424
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:25,069
The night Joe died,
he came into town.

425
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,317
He started going off about strange
things, you know, about...

426
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:36,038
...the lights in the sky
and aliens, crop circles.

427
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,788
He came down to the local
and started threatening people,

428
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,319
so they called me in.

429
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:46,357
I came down, I calmed him down and
I followed him home...

430
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,109
and at the turn off, I let him go.

431
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,029
Now, I know, I should've run him in,
I should've let him sleep it off, but...

432
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,032
...I didn't and I'm sorry about that.

433
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,993
-Listen, it's not your fault.
-I'm still sorry.

434
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,908
Yeah?

435
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,394
Mrs... Mrs. Sanders.

436
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,153
Hold on... one second.

437
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,758
Layne, just cause he lost it
there at the end, doesn't mean...

438
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,429
...he wasn't the same person.

439
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,230
Okay.

440
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,469
I'll talk to you later.

441
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,149
Yes, Ma'am.

442
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,794
God, it's a beautiful night!

443
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,112
So, what are you thinking about?

444
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:04,188
Joe and I used to do all these things
up here together, you know.

445
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,918
It's strange when you have a memory
of somebody, an idea.

446
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,395
You haven't seen them in a while
and when you revisit it,

447
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:20,669
you know? it's tainted by what people
say or how the person has acted...

448
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,278
...and it changes things
on how you viewed that person.

449
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,755
I don't know.

450
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,669
You know what I mean?

451
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,270
Yeah, I do.

452
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,679
My grandma.

453
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,632
When my parents split up,

454
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,512
she moved in with us.

455
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,835
She was in her late sixties, I think.

456
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,956
I don't know, out of nowhere, just,

457
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,629
she started dressing up
in the middle of the day...

458
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:05,153
...and she'd sit on the couch,
with her purse in her lap.

459
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,711
I asked her what she
was waiting for.

460
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:14,509
And she said she was waiting
for her sister...

461
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,479
...to come pick her up and take her
to the "picture show."

462
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,110
Her sister died back in the forties.

463
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,150
I don't know. After that,
it just got worse...

464
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:35,271
...and worse, and she never
came back.

465
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,796
God! It was like she found...

466
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:42,719
...some warm incredible memory to
escape into,

467
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,672
and she just never came back.

468
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,112
And there was nothing we could do...

469
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,238
...so my mom put her in a home.

470
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:02,999
And she died there.

471
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:06,629
Alone.

472
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,717
-I'm sorry.
-Thank you.

473
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,072
I'm sorry about Joe.

474
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,439
God, I miss her!

475
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,630
Oh, come on!
Just cut those ducks.

476
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,799
-Don't I always get this card?
-Yeah, but that's a good one.

477
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,679
-Oh, I see.
-Wait until I finish.

478
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:41,676
What's that?

479
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,791
We have to start in the center first.

480
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,592
Forget that. What's that?

481
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:48,709
What does this mean?

482
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:53,510
You know what I don't... I don't think
I did it right. I cut the cards wrong.

483
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:54,630
-Yeah.
-Are you sure?

484
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:55,909
Yeah. I did something wrong. I don't know.

485
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:57,314
-It's not your fault.
-Are you sure?

486
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,718
-How about I just do your nails?
-Alright.

487
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:00,796
-Ok?
-Sounds good.

488
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,274
God, this guy sucks!

489
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,435
Stephen!

490
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,155
-Stephen!
-Yeah?

491
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:09,957
-You coming to bed?
-No, I'm watching the game, sweetie.

492
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,993
-Ok, I'm gonna do Iris' nails.
-Ok.

493
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,673
So, what color?

494
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,553
What do you think about orange with
green highlights?

495
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,199
I promise you, orange is gonna...

496
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,391
-...go perfectwith your hair.
-Orange! Great!

497
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:31,390
-I'll go get it.
-Sure?

498
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:32,828
-Yeah, don't worry about it!
-Ok!

499
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:40,875
-Hi.
-Hi.

500
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,712
-How are you doing?
-Good!

501
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:55,319
-What was that?
-What was what?

502
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:59,235
-That!
-Aah! Maurice!

503
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:04,191
He's... kind of yummy, isn't he?

504
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:06,273
Are you checking him out?

505
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,198
Well, I think he's checking me out too.

506
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,595
I mean, every time I look at him,
he's looking at me.

507
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:14,237
-And?
-And, well,

508
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,350
he's got a body on him, doesn't he?

509
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:20,997
You know? I don't really look
at him like that.

510
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,315
Ok!

511
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,233
There's not enough orange.

512
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:30,829
Ok, so we'll do it blue for your eyes.

513
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:34,635
You know what? I'm not really
up for it tonight, I'm kind of tired.

514
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,677
-You sure?
-Yeah. Maybe tomorrow?

515
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,677
-Ok! No problem!
-Thanks!

516
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:42,755
Well, then, you just have
sweet dreams about Maurice.

517
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:45,036
Well, have fun with Stephen,
but don't make too much noise,

518
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:46,832
cause I'd like to sleep this evening.

519
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,279
-Sleep tight!
-You too, babe.

520
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,871
I'll see you in the morning.

521
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,674
Take it off, take it off...

522
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,390
Damn, girl, you...

523
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:17,231
Ok! Damn, girl!
Look at that ass!

524
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:41,150
Oh, yeah! Ok, come on!

525
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:54,595
No you didn't, girl?

526
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:56,355
Oh, shit!

527
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:02,195
-What? What the hell are you doing?
-Come one! Come on! Get away!

528
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:06,148
-Get out! Get the hell away from me!
-Come on! Sshh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

529
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,350
Look, man!

530
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:10,278
You've got five seconds to tell me what
the hell you're doing.

531
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:11,959
Hey, Jesus, guys!

532
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:14,314
There was something at the window.

533
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:15,710
What?

534
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,433
Ok, there was something
at the window.

535
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,399
How do you know if you
weren't in here? Huh? Huh?

536
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,438
You were watching me?

537
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:26,469
-You sick creep, you were watching me?
-That's okay...

538
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:28,079
-Stop!
-Calm down!

539
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:33,478
Maurice, you wanna tell me
what's going on here?

540
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,193
-Is there anything out there?
-No!

541
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,470
We're on the second floor, how could
there been something in the window?

542
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,716
There wasn't anything outside
the window, was there?!

543
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,717
Ok, I saw something, I promise
you I saw something.

544
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,036
I know I busted through the room
door and I'm sorry.

545
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,390
I did not mean to scare you, ok?

546
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,989
I did not mean to scare you but there
was something outside the door.

547
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,589
-What, an owl?
-l, I don't know... It was something...

548
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:57,352
it was like... it was like a person, ok?
It had different shapes and a weird body,

549
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:58,675
a weird body. It was like a person.

550
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,269
Why the hell were you even
looking in her room?

551
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,959
He was watching me undress.

552
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:06,596
No... Ok, yes!
Yeah, I was watching you undress.

553
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,155
I heard you saying my name, ok,
you were saying...

554
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:12,559
-Please, please, please!
-I said I was sorry!

555
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:15,156
-Ok, man, I said I was sorry!
-It's ok.

556
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,515
-Jesus!
-I said I was sorry, man!

557
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:18,955
-Iris, I'm sorry!
-What is wrong with you?

558
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:23,870
Hey, stop, stop! This is not
helping the situation, ok? Calm down!

559
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:25,277
Jesus!

560
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:26,196
You were spying?

561
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:30,029
Ok, if that's what you want to call it,
yes, I was spying, ok?

562
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:33,152
But I heard you say my name,
and I wanted...

563
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:35,078
...to know what you were saying
about me, ok?

564
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:39,557
And I looked through the door
and I saw you.

565
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:47,313
Iris, I apologize for my friend
peeping on you, ok?

566
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,158
And if there's anything that I
can do to make you...

567
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:50,793
-Why don't you get rid of him.
-You wanna shut up, please?

568
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,353
-Can I say something...?
-Please, shut up, both of you!

569
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:53,629
Please, go outside!

570
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,636
-I'm sorry Iris, I'm sorry!
-Maurice, can you go outside!

571
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,394
-Iris, I'm so sorry!
-Go outside! Go outside! Go outside!

572
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,431
I promise you this is not like him.

573
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,917
-I'm so sorry.
-What the hell were you thinking, man!

574
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:13,111
It's ok, it'ok...you all right?

575
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:48,956
Here.

576
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:51,196
Thanks.

577
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:59,831
Hey, look, I'm sorry about going
off like that.

578
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:05,118
Look, you bust in, you see that...
I understand.

579
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:07,510
Alright, then.

580
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,793
-She still won't talk to me.
-You did mess up, didn't you?

581
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:18,796
Yeah.

582
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,794
But, damn, she's acting
like I shot her dog or something.

583
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,199
Just give her few of days.

584
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:26,509
She's been through a lot.

585
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,233
How big do you think this place is?

586
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,833
I don't know.
About forty acres or so?

587
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:36,309
That figures.

588
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,398
He doesn't look too happy.

589
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:49,269
What did she say?

590
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:54,596
-Sixty six-five, all in.
-What? That's bullshit!

591
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,153
The acreage alone is worth
more than that.

592
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:57,588
That's what I thought but...

593
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,515
...the area is depressed, over-farmed.

594
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:01,790
You know...

595
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:03,998
It's better than nothing, right?

596
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:08,070
Damn!

597
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:10,192
It's gonna look good, too,
when we're done with it.

598
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:14,433
Yeah, on that note,
you boys gonna help me with the side?

599
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:15,749
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

600
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:23,915
Looking good, ladies! Looking good!

601
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:53,118
Oh shit!

602
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:02,279
-Jesus!
-Are you killing a cow over there?

603
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:07,596
-Are you sure you guys don't want some?
-No, I'm good, thanks.

604
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:11,236
You know what I really feel like?
Is a burger from that place, Lillie's.

605
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,271
-All up in the grizzly.
-Let's go there today.

606
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:16,798
Hey, have you guys seen Iris?

607
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:18,439
No, not this morning.

608
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,756
She's not in her room, and her
bed is still made.

609
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,591
Hey, Maurice? Maurice?

610
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,438
-Are you there?
-Yeah? I'm right here.

611
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,710
-What you knocking on the door for?
-Have you seen Iris?

612
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:35,150
-No.
-Did you hear her come in last night?

613
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:37,476
I was up late, but I had the
headphones on.

614
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:40,035
I don't think I would have
noticed anyway... Why?

615
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:42,395
Shit.

616
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:46,959
Iris!

617
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:50,755
Iris!

618
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:53,594
Iris!

619
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,950
Here, let's try calling her.
What's her number?

620
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,317
We can't! Our cell phones
don't work out here.

621
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:00,589
Have you got any ideas?

622
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:03,076
-Shit!
-For all I know she could be anywhere.

623
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,550
-She sometimes went out for a smoke.
-Where?

624
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:09,877
I don't know. She didn't want you guys
to know that she was doing it.

625
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:12,831
I think, the pack in the back
of your truck.

626
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:17,593
Iris!

627
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:26,755
That's her bag.

628
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:37,310
What?

629
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,233
What the...

630
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:51,509
They took her.

631
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,428
In there.

632
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:59,549
Katrina, Macy, go inside
and call the sheriff, alright?

633
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:01,273
You two come with me.

634
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:03,831
Oh, Jeez, she's fine. Come on!

635
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:10,755
Iris!

636
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:12,913
Iris!

637
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:16,599
Iris!

638
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:19,515
Iris!

639
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:22,876
Iris!

640
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:26,229
Iris!

641
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:30,194
-Iris!
-Iris!

642
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:36,356
Iris!

643
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:37,959
Hey guys, hold on!

644
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:39,556
What?

645
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:42,271
-What is it?
-Can you smell that?

646
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:45,957
-What? Is that ozone again?
-Shit!

647
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:47,149
Damn it!

648
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:19,075
This wasn't here yesterday.

649
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:22,198
No, we would have seen it from the roof.

650
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:36,590
What is that?

651
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:40,671
That's her... that's her bracelet?

652
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,510
-Oh, my god...
-Oh, fuck...

653
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,189
What is that?

654
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:52,433
It looks like...

655
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:56,317
-Like what? Like what?
-Like surgical pins.

656
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:00,475
-Surgical pins?
-Yeah, I have a couple in my wrist...

657
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,515
-Iris had a few.
-What are you talking about?

658
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:09,156
Remember that accident last year?
The one by Bitter Creek?

659
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:13,075
A couple of guys on your team were killed.
It was all over the news.

660
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:15,629
-Yeah.
-Iris was in the back-seat.

661
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:17,759
Killed a couple of her best friends,
and she...

662
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:20,437
...was really messed up for
about eight months.

663
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:21,476
What are you saying?

664
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:25,151
She had her hip
pinned back together.

665
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:29,312
With about six pins.

666
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:31,471
Jesus Christ!

667
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:40,353
So, she never did anything
like this before?

668
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:41,875
No. Not at all.
I mean,

669
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:44,993
she was really depressed for a few
months after the accident, but...

670
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,599
...this just isn't like her.

671
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:50,549
I'll do what I can, but we gotta wait.

672
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:56,517
I can't inform the state until tomorrow,
twenty four hours and all that crap.

673
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,915
Sheriff, what about all that
stuff in the field?

674
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:03,029
Well, the bracelet was hers, right?

675
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:06,630
As far as those needles are concerned,
I don't know what they were.

676
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:08,751
I'm telling you they were surgical pins.

677
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:11,279
Are you a medical student?

678
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:13,992
-No, but I have a couple...
-Stephen!

679
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:16,714
Come on, man, he's right.
We're all jumping to conclusions here.

680
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:19,070
What about the footprints?
What about the circles?

681
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:21,157
I wish I had answers for you, but I don't.

682
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:23,316
Well, if you don't, then who does?

683
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:28,319
It's ridiculous.

684
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:34,274
Hey, sorry. Everybody is just a little
on edge right now, you know?

685
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:38,436
Sure, I completely understand, I mean...

686
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:42,599
Layne, my hands are tied here, ok?
I'm short of manpower,

687
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:46,429
I've got miles to cover, you know?

688
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:47,755
I know what you're saying.

689
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:48,995
Right?

690
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:51,312
I have to ask you something
you might not like.

691
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:52,396
Ok...

692
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:54,756
Do you think your friends have
anything to do with this?

693
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:59,910
-No.
-You sure?

694
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,077
-Yeah, I'm positive.
-Alright.

695
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:06,431
Why don't you all come stay at the
motel or just come to town...

696
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,517
...until we figure out what's
going on around here.

697
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:11,439
I mean, I appreciate that but I think
we'd all just like to stay here,

698
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:13,710
just in case she wanders back
or something, you know?

699
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:15,909
It's a good idea.

700
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:20,669
Alright, thanks. Really.

701
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:26,197
Layne, it's not your fault either, right?

702
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:52,158
What time is it?

703
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:54,750
It's like... eight o'clock.

704
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:56,279
I don't even know the date.

705
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:00,914
-Sunday.
-No, the date.

706
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:03,719
September twenty second.

707
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:05,588
We've been here for like a week.

708
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,678
It's the equinox tonight.

709
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:12,117
-What?
-It's the first day of Fall.

710
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:14,074
A witches Sabbath...

711
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:17,477
-Come on, Katrina, don't start that shit.
-It was just an observation, Stephen.

712
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:19,989
Yeah, but we don't need to hear
that crap right now. Okay?

713
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:24,030
He's right. We need to focus
on the issue here.

714
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:29,394
Ok, then, let's focus on the situation
and let's actually talk about it, guys, ok?

715
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:32,160
Iris disappeared, vanished into thin air.

716
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:34,555
Crop circles don't just appear out of
nowhere, guys...

717
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:37,393
...and there are no logical
explanations for any of this.

718
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:39,955
I don't think she just wandered
off into the crops.

719
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:42,912
Well, there are other possibilities...

720
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:44,835
Why don't you just say it?

721
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:46,909
Maybe I will.

722
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:50,229
-What you, got, what you got?
-Stop it! Stop it!

723
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:51,550
I didn't do shit to that girl!

724
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:53,239
You watched her take her
fucking clothes off!

725
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:53,792
Guys, alright!

726
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,514
-Yeah, but I didn't kidnap her.
-Guys, just knock it off!

727
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:59,672
Jesus Christ! Be rational here
and think this through.

728
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:02,599
Rational? What about that thing
that was at her window?

729
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:05,314
Oh, don't start that shit again
or I will keep talking!

730
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:07,195
What about those pins?

731
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:09,035
What pins?

732
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:11,196
-What, you didn't tell them?
-Tell us what?

733
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,276
Nothing! We were in the field
and we found these pins...

734
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:15,833
...and Stephen thinks they're
surgical pins.

735
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:17,598
I know they're surgical pins.

736
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:20,271
Iris had six pins in her hip.

737
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:24,076
Come on, you guys,
that doesn't make any sense.

738
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:27,397
-I mean, you found pins in a field?
-What are those pins made from?

739
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:28,749
Surgical steel.

740
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:31,275
And what is surgical steel made from?

741
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:32,510
Iron.

742
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:36,751
-Oh, my god!
-What?

743
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,837
Guys, iron!

744
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:42,473
This entire place is surrounded
with iron!

745
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:45,638
-What's hanging over the door?
-It's a horseshoe, baby!

746
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:48,229
-Everybody's got one out here.
-Every single door in town.

747
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:51,352
-Yeah, but why?
-Horseshoes are for good luck.

748
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:56,355
No, it's not the horseshoe,
it's the iron. It wards off bad spirits.

749
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:02,918
Guys, just come with me to the attic
for a second.

750
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:04,953
I have something to show you.

751
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:25,755
Go, Maureen.

752
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:29,270
In response to your ten-sixty five, I have
confirmation of the address for one...

753
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:34,190
...Iris Doyle, parents William and Rose Doyle.
41 8 South Magnolia, Ann Arbor, Michigan.

754
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:35,549
Hold on a minute.

755
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:21,948
Oh my god!

756
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:33,832
Why didn't you say something
about this?

757
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:35,275
I don't know.

758
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:39,117
I just kind of thought
that Joe lost his mind, you know?

759
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:41,199
Didn't want to freak you guys out.

760
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:50,996
Look, Katrina, this is iron.

761
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:53,794
What were you saying about that?

762
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:56,909
In mythology, iron is the bane of demons.

763
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:58,951
Ok, so... what does that mean?

764
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,195
-It kills them.
-Wait,

765
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:06,110
these are pictures of aliens.

766
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:08,880
Some people believe that our
concept of aliens...

767
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:12,277
...stems from ancient legends
about demons.

768
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:15,035
It's the same creature,
just a different name.

769
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:22,195
Look at these eyes.

770
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:25,911
That's what I saw outside Iris' window!

771
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:29,439
-Shit...
-Jesus!

772
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:37,590
Is that some sort of hand or something?

773
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:41,313
-No, it's too long...
-Is that from an animal?

774
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:43,951
Jesus! Look at those claws!

775
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:45,798
No, I don't think so...

776
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:49,318
Is that thing even real?

777
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:51,797
It looks like it got twin thumbs.

778
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,754
Wait, there's some kind of band
on the bottom of it.

779
01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:59,951
It looks metal...
It's like...

780
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:04,512
...some kind of...
pattern or...

781
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:08,034
What do you think it is?

782
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:11,068
I think this is from
like another planet.

783
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:12,349
Guys, this is amazing!

784
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:17,071
-It just moved!
-Hell no, hell no!

785
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:18,315
What the hell was that?

786
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:20,158
I don't know, but whatever it is,
I ain't sticking around to find out.

787
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:21,236
Let's get the hell outta here.

788
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:22,668
Okay, you guys can talk science
fiction all you want.

789
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:24,671
-I'm calling the sheriff.
-Dude, screw the sheriff...

790
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:27,394
Let's get the hell out of here, ok?
Let's go!

791
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:29,671
-Come on!
-Did you guys see that?

792
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:32,150
-Oh no, you're not staying. Go. Come on!
-Oh my, that was...

793
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:38,112
-You ready to go?
-No!

794
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:40,559
Dude, talk to your girl.

795
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:42,432
-No way, baby, let's go!
-No, I don't wanna go.

796
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:44,678
-What's going on?
-She wants to stay.

797
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:45,790
She thinks they're friendly.

798
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,672
-Trina!
-Why wouldn't they be?

799
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:50,519
Baby, you saw the claws on that thing.
It didn't look friendly to me.

800
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:52,119
Just think of how advanced
they are, ok?

801
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:54,038
-And all the things...
-Listen to me.

802
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:56,390
History's full of advanced civilizations...

803
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:59,558
...coming in and wiping out
developing ones.

804
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:02,878
Ok, all we can do right now is
get out of here.

805
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:04,672
So, let's let somebody else
figure it out, ok?

806
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:06,757
-Ok?
-Iris is still missing.

807
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:09,989
-Oh my god!
-Shit!

808
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:11,715
Jesus.

809
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:17,516
-Get some water, get some water!
-Am I glad to see you, guys...

810
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:23,313
Son of a bitch blind-sided me in the
corn field; tore me up pretty good.

811
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:25,875
Thanks.
What the hell are those things?

812
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:30,755
I clocked him one.
Knocked him flat on his ass.

813
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:32,593
Oh, god! Something's happening...

814
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:34,917
-Let's get out of here.
-Jesus Christ!

815
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:36,838
-I just got here!
-Oh my god!

816
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:40,999
Get in the car, Mace!

817
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:47,516
Open the door! Open the door!

818
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:51,274
It won't start, it won't start.

819
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:55,677
Katrina! Katrina!

820
01:07:57,080 --> 01:08:01,073
Go in the house!
Oh shit! Get off! Get off!

821
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,149
Oh, shit!

822
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:06,590
Get out of there!

823
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:09,189
Maurice! Maurice!

824
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:15,709
Oh, shit!

825
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:21,032
Let go of me! Where is he?

826
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:23,751
No, wait, wait! Where is Maurice?

827
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:24,876
Where is Maurice?

828
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:36,793
How could you leave him out there?
You call yourself a Sheriff?

829
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:07,509
I can't believe this is happening!

830
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:12,158
Maybe he is gone.

831
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,149
We need some weapons.

832
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:29,390
Here.

833
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:32,076
Take it!

834
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,592
I was hoping for something a little
bigger than this!

835
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:38,315
-Yeah, but it's iron...
-You guys, iron!

836
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:42,069
This entire house was covered
in iron when we got here.

837
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:43,110
And we took it all away...

838
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:45,356
-What the hell are you all talking about?
-It's a theory.

839
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:46,436
What is?

840
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:48,551
That iron is the only thing that would kill
these things!

841
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:50,432
-How do you know that?
-IT'S A THEORY!

842
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:51,356
Alright!

843
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:53,428
I was up in the attic,

844
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:56,319
I found these tapes belonging to Joe
He talked about these aliens...

845
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:58,596
...and how iron was the only thing
that affected them.

846
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:01,439
They're here.
They're moving!

847
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:03,790
-Oh my god! Oh my god!
-Why aren't they doing anything?

848
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,991
-Maybe they can't.
-What do you mean, "they can't"?

849
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:07,952
I don't know.
What do I look like a Trekkie?

850
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:12,188
What is that?

851
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:16,156
Get away from the window!

852
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:17,790
-Come on!
-They are coming!

853
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,558
Oh, god! Get back here!

854
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:21,837
Get back, get back!

855
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:25,236
You know this won't do anything,
don't you?

856
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:29,356
Yeah, Joe put iron filings in
some of the shells.

857
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:31,838
The problem is I don't which ones.

858
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:33,349
Use all of them.

859
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:47,435
Holy shit!

860
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:51,470
Stephen!

861
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:03,914
I guess you were right.

862
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:14,350
You son of a bitch!

863
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,788
Oh my god!
I can't believe that just happened.

864
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:31,394
Let's board up these windows.
Come on!

865
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:34,110
Here.

866
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:41,270
I love you. I love you.

867
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:56,952
Oh yeah, I think you need
a little iron in your diet.

868
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:12,679
Stephen, no!
Oh my god, no!

869
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:20,557
No! Oh my god!

870
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:27,796
-Oh my God.
-No, no!

871
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:32,479
Please, please! No, noooo!

872
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:49,875
Anything?

873
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:54,598
No, nothing.

874
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:58,116
Sheriff, we gotta do something, ok?

875
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:00,477
We are sitting ducks here.

876
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:04,628
Our options are limited,
and we know they can get in the house.

877
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:06,349
See that doesn't make any sense.

878
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:09,313
Why, why now?
They never tried to do it before.

879
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:12,433
We are missing something.

880
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:14,599
I mean, what do we know?
What are the...

881
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:16,275
What do you remember?
What are the facts?

882
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:17,674
What are the certainties?

883
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:22,112
Every time we found this crop circle,
there was this smell of... of ozone,

884
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:26,108
and it seemed like they were using the
circles as a way to get around, but...

885
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:29,799
they never used it to get in the house.

886
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:34,873
Until the transformer blew.

887
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:38,792
-Electricity?
-Yeah, it all makes sense.

888
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:42,675
Joe had obviously created some sort of
electromagnetic field around the house.

889
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,359
That's it! That's it!

890
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:48,838
Electricity obviously jams their signal,
so they can't transport back and forth,

891
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:50,393
you know, that's why they appear
in places like this...

892
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:52,909
-Whatever! We need the power on?
-Yes!

893
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:55,315
-Okay, fine.
-That's our only chance.

894
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:56,589
But we don't have a transformer.

895
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,552
Yes we do. We have a back-up
generator in the shed.

896
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:00,079
Here, well, take the shotgun.

897
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:02,235
Keep it.

898
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:11,312
We can hold these bastards off.

899
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:24,589
Come on!

900
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:36,151
Hey...wow

901
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:39,117
What's wrong?

902
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:42,429
I love you!

903
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:45,469
I love you too.

904
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:51,110
I'm so sorry I've never said it.

905
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:22,077
Oh, god!

906
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:28,236
Wait!

907
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,514
-Get this thing going!
-I'm trying!

908
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:51,190
-I think they're coming!
-Why? What's wrong?

909
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:53,753
Just trust me!

910
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:57,672
-Oh God, what's wrong?
-It's too late...

911
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:58,876
No.

912
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:01,839
-Katrina.
-Katrina

913
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:02,956
Get her out of here!

914
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:05,798
-Don't leave her, please!
-Come on! Come on!

915
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:08,513
Here! Take this!

916
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:10,075
Let's go!

917
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:12,877
Run!

918
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:16,629
-Meet me at the van!
-No!

919
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:17,352
Go! Go!

920
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:19,152
-What are you doing?
-Trying to give them a fighting chance.

921
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,956
-We've gotta get out of here!
-Come on! Come on!

922
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:27,676
Get out of here!

923
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:30,039
Move! Get out of here!

924
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:38,473
-Oh, shit!
-Something's happening?

925
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:43,071
There'll be hundreds of them...
Come on... Come on! Fuck!

926
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:51,997
-What did you do?
-I just jammed their signal.

927
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:10,435
-Go!
-I'm going!

928
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:23,679
-Come on, go!
-I'm going!

929
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:31,155
Oh my god!

930
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:32,470
Come on!

931
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:01,788
Oh my god!

932
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:05,595
Babe, you ok?

933
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:17,477
Let's get out of here! Let's go.

934
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:21,118
-Jesus Christ.
-Oh my god! Katrina!

935
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:22,789
Get in the car!

936
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:24,629
Get in the car!

937
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:28,631
Oh my god! Go!

938
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:33,154
Go, go, go!

939
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:00,715
I love you.

940
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:07,516
...no official word on the cause
of the blackout,

941
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:09,153
but state officials have assured
the public...

942
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:11,999
...that they are doing everything in their
power to resolve the situation.

943
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:14,430
Again, our top news story this hour.

944
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:17,234
Five western states are without
power this morning,

945
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:19,715
as a massive blackout struck Arizona,
California, Nevada,

946
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:24,471
Oregon, Washington and possibly
parts of Idaho and western Canada.

947
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:28,593
There have also been scattered reports
of odd electrical discharges...

948
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:31,951
...excuse me. As well as reports of attacks
on several people by,

949
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:35,357
and I'm quoting: "strange creatures".

950
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:39,759
For more on this story, we're going live now
to George Wells in downtown Portland.

951
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,592
George, what's the latest?

952
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:45,236
Well Jack, as of two minutes ago, the governor
put out the call to the National Guard...
