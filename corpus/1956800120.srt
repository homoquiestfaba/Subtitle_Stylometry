Is that supposed to happen?

742
00:58:51,866 --> 00:58:53,734
I have no idea!

743
00:58:55,002 --> 00:58:57,002
I was just trying to
prevent someone else

744
00:58:57,004 --> 00:58:58,839
from evoking the Sacred Armor!

745
00:59:00,307 --> 00:59:01,675
[Atia] It is not possible.

746
00:59:03,377 --> 00:59:04,845
What is not possible?

747
00:59:06,247 --> 00:59:07,248
Atia, tell me.

748
00:59:07,982 --> 00:59:10,749
When the four stones
came together,

749
00:59:10,751 --> 00:59:13,385
their joint power
swept away the magic.

750
00:59:13,387 --> 00:59:14,555
What do you mean?

751
00:59:15,356 --> 00:59:16,488
Explain yourself!

752
00:59:16,490 --> 00:59:21,126
That now Mairok is visible
to the forces of Shadawar.

753
00:59:21,128 --> 00:59:22,861
Do something!

754
00:59:22,863 --> 00:59:24,265
Warn him of the danger he is in!

755
00:59:24,932 --> 00:59:27,900
My powers are not strong enough.

756
00:59:27,902 --> 00:59:30,869
I can't reach it with my mind.

757
00:59:30,871 --> 00:59:35,576
- Now Mairok is alone.
- [air whooshing]

758
00:59:37,878 --> 00:59:39,647
The Sacred Armor.

759
00:59:40,681 --> 00:59:42,781
[power whooshing]

760
00:59:42,783 --> 00:59:43,882
Mairok, what's that?

761
00:59:43,884 --> 00:59:44,752
Stay back!

762
00:59:46,687 --> 00:59:48,322
That's the same
portal my brother...

763
00:59:49,890 --> 00:59:51,192
My brother, Iruma!

764
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:55,629
Mairok, watch out!

765
00:59:56,397 --> 00:59:59,064
Remember what the
Shadow told you!

766
00:59:59,066 --> 01:00:01,366
[portal whooshing]

767
01:00:01,368 --> 01:00:02,203
[Mairok] Iruma!

768
01:00:03,671 --> 01:00:04,903
Brother!

769
01:00:04,905 --> 01:00:05,739
Brother.

770
01:00:09,276 --> 01:00:12,311
I was imprisoned by
Shadawar's forces.

771
01:00:12,313 --> 01:00:14,413
They had me imprisoned until
someone gathered the stones

772
01:00:14,415 --> 01:00:15,916
to evoke the Sacred Armor.

773
01:00:17,718 --> 01:00:18,352
Iruma.

[suspenseful music]

777
01:00:33,067 --> 01:00:35,868
Your weak-minded brother
tried to stop me.

778
01:00:35,870 --> 01:00:39,037
Little did he know,
nothing can stop Shadawar!

779
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:40,472
Not even death!

780
01:00:40,474 --> 01:00:41,840
- [kick thudding]
- [Mairok groaning]

[Mairok groaning]

790
01:01:53,847 --> 01:01:55,716
You would have been
better off staying dead.

791
01:02:01,055 --> 01:02:02,356
You want to fight me?

792
01:02:03,290 --> 01:02:04,959
You really are an idiot.

793
01:02:05,993 --> 01:02:06,827
Yeah, maybe,

794
01:02:08,362 --> 01:02:10,329
but don't underestimate
this idiot.

795
01:02:10,331 --> 01:02:11,830

Brother!

801
01:02:23,244 --> 01:02:26,413
Please, tell me a part of
you is still inside there!

802
01:02:27,515 --> 01:02:28,916
Mairok, please.

to show mercy.</i>

811
01:02:55,543 --> 01:02:56,875

[Shadawar whooshing]

821
01:03:57,371 --> 01:03:59,971
Time to die, sweet prince.

822
01:03:59,973 --> 01:04:01,942
And next up, your beloved king.

823
01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:06,178
[fire whooshing]

824
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:07,647

Father, forgive me.

[Atia] I'm sorry, my king.

833
01:05:14,381 --> 01:05:16,682
Everything is lost.

834
01:05:16,684 --> 01:05:17,519
Mairok.

835
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:19,953
Iruma.

836
01:05:21,455 --> 01:05:22,289
Shadawar!

837
01:05:24,992 --> 01:05:27,025
How is this possible?

838
01:05:27,027 --> 01:05:28,761
I swore I'd return, Golan Mor.

839
01:05:28,763 --> 01:05:29,997
Atia!

840
01:05:30,698 --> 01:05:32,232
Call the guards!

841
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:36,736
I fear she is so
overwhelmed with emotion

842
01:05:36,738 --> 01:05:39,106
to be able to find her words.

843
01:05:41,074 --> 01:05:43,310
What happened to my sons?

844
01:05:44,111 --> 01:05:46,779

The era of the Ancestral
World ends here.

848
01:05:57,024 --> 01:05:59,725
This is the rise of my kingdom.

849

The beginning of chaos!

850
01:06:02,396 --> 01:06:07,401

01:06:15,209 --> 01:06:16,511
It's time to die.

854
01:06:18,813 --> 01:06:22,316
This time, no one and
nothing will be saving you.

01:06:50,812 --> 01:06:52,444
You're right.

865
01:06:52,446 --> 01:06:53,445
I really am an idiot.

866
01:06:53,447 --> 01:06:54,346
No.

The era of the Ancestral
World ends here.

01:08:14,494 --> 01:08:16,163
You are a fool, Shadawar.

880
01:08:16,764 --> 01:08:20,165
You may kill me, but
you will never win.

- Please.

When you placed the last stone,

885
01:08:47,962 --> 01:08:49,864
I could feel the spell breaking.

886
01:08:52,466 --> 01:08:54,636
I haven't yet turned
back into a mortal

887
01:08:56,904 --> 01:08:59,237
but I can now fully control

888
01:08:59,239 --> 01:09:00,842
the energy that
makes me immortal.

What happened?

891

Don't worry about it.

[gentle piano music]

893
01:09:22,496 --> 01:09:25,198
I finally realized
what my purpose is.

894
01:09:27,434 --> 01:09:29,771
You are the warrior
I was waiting for.

895
01:09:32,607 --> 01:09:34,174
I love you, Mairok.

896
01:09:35,409 --> 01:09:36,742
No.

897
01:09:36,744 --> 01:09:38,511
Don't do this.

898
01:09:38,513 --> 01:09:40,682
My life is worth nothing
compared to yours.

899
01:09:41,949 --> 01:09:43,951
I lived centuries, Mairok.

900
01:09:46,754 --> 01:09:49,757
But I've never felt truly
alive until I met you.

901

You will pay for what
you've done to me!

You're still alive?

That damned immortal.

925
01:11:39,399 --> 01:11:40,835
