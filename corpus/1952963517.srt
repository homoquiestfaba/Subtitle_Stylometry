1
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,580
- Father!
- Mary!

2
00:01:06,749 --> 00:01:08,011
Papa!

3
00:01:18,594 --> 00:01:21,825
I know you have little for yourself, Father.

4
00:01:23,432 --> 00:01:26,629
Promise me you'll take care of Nello?

5
00:01:30,606 --> 00:01:33,507
Do you still have my drawings?

6
00:01:33,709 --> 00:01:34,869
Yes.

7
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:39,314
Please give them to my boy...

8
00:01:41,784 --> 00:01:44,344
...to help him remember me.

9
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:51,622
Even when I'm gone...

10
00:01:52,461 --> 00:01:54,452
...I'll be watching over you...

11
00:01:54,663 --> 00:01:57,655
...my little masterpiece.

12
00:01:58,234 --> 00:02:02,102
God has so much planned for you.

13
00:02:05,608 --> 00:02:07,200
I love you.

14
00:02:08,611 --> 00:02:10,670
I love you, Nello.

15
00:02:12,248 --> 00:02:14,079
I'll always be with you.

16
00:04:29,118 --> 00:04:31,086
Can you hear your mother?

17
00:04:35,424 --> 00:04:38,018
You must listen with your heart.

18
00:04:38,994 --> 00:04:43,590
She talks through your God-given talent.
You even make me look good!

19
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:47,063
Come on! I'll race you to the village.

20
00:04:48,203 --> 00:04:49,568
Come on!

21
00:04:50,372 --> 00:04:53,671
- I'll beat you, Grandpa!
- Look at him go.

22
00:04:54,176 --> 00:04:56,144
I'll beat you!

23
00:05:11,527 --> 00:05:13,893
- Here you are, Nello.
- Thank you.

24
00:05:14,396 --> 00:05:15,761
Good day.

25
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,306
- Good morning, madam.
- Hello. And good day to you, sir.

26
00:05:33,315 --> 00:05:35,146
What have you been up to now?

27
00:05:35,484 --> 00:05:38,180
Have you forgotten how old you are?

28
00:05:38,387 --> 00:05:39,911
Oh, yeah.

29
00:05:40,189 --> 00:05:44,023
I prefer to think of my spirit as ageless.

30
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,520
- Here.
- No, no. The boy, the boy.

31
00:05:49,665 --> 00:05:51,257
Thank you, sir.

32
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,195
If you please.

33
00:05:53,569 --> 00:05:54,968
Thank you, ma'am.

34
00:05:56,438 --> 00:05:57,803
Just a moment.

35
00:05:58,307 --> 00:06:00,468
That's for you.

36
00:06:01,143 --> 00:06:02,303
If you please.

37
00:06:02,511 --> 00:06:04,877
- Thank you, ma'am.
- And this too.

38
00:06:19,294 --> 00:06:20,386
Move!

39
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:24,565
Move!

40
00:06:51,326 --> 00:06:52,418
You know what, Nello?

41
00:06:52,661 --> 00:06:56,825
I think tonight we'll have veal stew.
Minus the veal, of course.

42
00:07:00,936 --> 00:07:02,301
Grandpa, look.

43
00:07:06,575 --> 00:07:07,769
Is he alive?

44
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:13,443
Barely.

45
00:07:14,383 --> 00:07:16,442
Who could do such a thing?

46
00:07:17,486 --> 00:07:20,455
Some men have no respect for life.

47
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:24,220
This is a dog of Flanders.

48
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,988
A hardworking breed of dog.

49
00:07:29,798 --> 00:07:32,926
We can't just leave him here.
Can we keep him?

50
00:07:33,235 --> 00:07:34,862
He can share my food.

51
00:07:46,448 --> 00:07:47,847
He's not hungry.

52
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,812
Well, it takes energy to eat.

53
00:07:51,119 --> 00:07:52,313
Leave it.

54
00:07:52,554 --> 00:07:54,146
Maybe later.

55
00:07:59,561 --> 00:08:01,722
What else can we do?

56
00:08:02,097 --> 00:08:05,225
A little broth and a lot of love.

57
00:08:05,634 --> 00:08:07,295
He's starved for both.

58
00:08:07,503 --> 00:08:11,337
I love you so much. So you'll have to
get better, okay?

59
00:08:20,415 --> 00:08:23,009
It's a magic necklace. It'll heal you.

60
00:08:32,528 --> 00:08:33,859
What's that?

61
00:08:34,062 --> 00:08:36,553
You should draw what you hope to see.

62
00:08:52,581 --> 00:08:55,175
It's too sad, Nello.

63
00:09:06,461 --> 00:09:08,361
That's better.

64
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:30,711
Grandpa, he's drinking it!
He's getting better.

65
00:09:31,453 --> 00:09:35,719
Well, I'm going to get me
one of those magic necklaces!

66
00:09:46,134 --> 00:09:48,261
That's the spirit.

67
00:09:50,606 --> 00:09:52,073
So, what do you think?

68
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:57,704
Never underestimate the power of love,
my boy.

69
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:05,244
He needs a name.

70
00:10:05,587 --> 00:10:06,952
Patrasche.

71
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:10,388
Your mother's middle name.

72
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:14,788
Then they'll both be watching over me.

73
00:10:20,636 --> 00:10:23,537
Grandfather, maybe you should
see a doctor.

74
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,798
For him to tell me something I already
know, that I'm old and tired?

75
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:29,477
I know that.

76
00:10:29,911 --> 00:10:31,173
Grandfather...

77
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:35,146
...you're never going to die
and leave me like Mother, are you?

78
00:10:43,158 --> 00:10:47,492
Why don't you take Patrasche and
introduce him to Aloise?

79
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:50,865
No, I'd rather stay here with you.

80
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:53,327
Come on. Go. Have fun.

81
00:10:53,502 --> 00:10:56,266
You're becoming an old man, like me.

82
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,932
Now we meet Aloise, my best friend.

83
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:08,045
Don't worry.
She's not a dog. She's just a girl.

84
00:11:25,801 --> 00:11:26,790
Hi, Aloise.

85
00:11:27,969 --> 00:11:29,402
Hi, Nello.

86
00:11:30,505 --> 00:11:31,972
Whose dog is it?

87
00:11:32,808 --> 00:11:36,141
Mine. Aloise, meet Patrasche,
my new best friend.

88
00:11:37,979 --> 00:11:40,413
I thought I was your best friend.

89
00:11:40,882 --> 00:11:45,546
I mean my best dog friend. Just like
Posche is your best horse friend.

90
00:11:47,656 --> 00:11:49,988
Okay, sounds reasonable.

91
00:11:50,859 --> 00:11:53,487
Nello, how come you never go to school?

92
00:11:54,062 --> 00:11:55,495
I don't know.

93
00:11:55,697 --> 00:11:57,722
Is it because you have to help
your grandfather?

94
00:11:57,899 --> 00:11:59,924
I like helping Grandpa.

95
00:12:02,871 --> 00:12:05,772
Besides, who cares about books anyway?

96
00:12:20,355 --> 00:12:21,652
Grandpa?

97
00:12:33,168 --> 00:12:36,535
I seem to be more trouble than help
these days.

98
00:12:37,105 --> 00:12:38,936
You're no trouble.

99
00:12:39,941 --> 00:12:43,672
You just need a magic necklace too.
I got you a present.

100
00:12:52,721 --> 00:12:54,951
I got you a present too.

101
00:12:59,928 --> 00:13:01,759
This was your mother's.

102
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:05,593
She wanted you to have it
so you would always remember her.

103
00:13:08,336 --> 00:13:09,928
Look at this.

104
00:13:10,105 --> 00:13:15,702
Seems like yesterday I was walking
along the canal with your mother.

105
00:13:16,278 --> 00:13:19,611
This was your mother's favorite place.

106
00:13:19,781 --> 00:13:23,877
Yes, God gave your mother
a wonderful talent.

107
00:13:24,052 --> 00:13:25,542
Just like you.

108
00:13:29,191 --> 00:13:33,457
That looks like the statue of the man
by the cathedral.

109
00:13:35,263 --> 00:13:38,391
It's Peter Paul Rubens.
Your mother's hero.

110
00:13:42,871 --> 00:13:45,840
This was your grandmother, Rosa.

111
00:13:51,613 --> 00:13:54,104
Influenza took her from me.

112
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:59,618
But, that is my favorite picture.

113
00:14:00,088 --> 00:14:02,613
Your mother drew that for my birthday.

114
00:14:03,859 --> 00:14:06,589
I wish I could've known Mother.

115
00:14:06,761 --> 00:14:10,697
- Well...
- Why did she leave the village?

116
00:14:10,866 --> 00:14:12,527
Well...

117
00:14:12,701 --> 00:14:15,499
She fell in love. She met your father.

118
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:19,697
- Did you know him well? My father?
- Well, your mother was...

119
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:26,110
She was very secretive about her love.
You know, she had her own mind.

120
00:14:27,582 --> 00:14:31,450
She never told me who your father was,
but...

121
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,612
...well, she loved him dearly. Yes.

122
00:14:34,789 --> 00:14:36,814
But were they in love?

123
00:14:38,927 --> 00:14:40,360
Of course.

124
00:14:40,528 --> 00:14:43,759
Of course they were in love.

125
00:14:43,932 --> 00:14:46,992
Why would you think they weren't?

126
00:14:47,168 --> 00:14:48,931
Of course.

127
00:14:49,104 --> 00:14:54,337
And, you know, she told me that
he was... He was a very good man.

128
00:15:08,456 --> 00:15:11,516
Not feeling too well again, Jehan?

129
00:15:11,693 --> 00:15:14,560
Just a touch of gout.

130
00:15:15,597 --> 00:15:18,191
- I'll be fine.
- Good.

131
00:15:18,366 --> 00:15:19,856
Now, where's my rent?

132
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:25,371
I have most of it, Master Stephens.

133
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,201
This is all?

134
00:15:29,811 --> 00:15:32,746
We'll pay you, Master Stephens.
We always do.

135
00:15:32,914 --> 00:15:37,544
You better had.
Sadly, patience is one virtue...

136
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:39,516
...I do not possess.

137
00:15:39,988 --> 00:15:41,979
Good evening, gentlemen.

138
00:15:47,495 --> 00:15:53,229
- I hate him.
- No, you never hate.

139
00:15:54,836 --> 00:15:59,102
Never lower yourself to the level
of people like that.

140
00:15:59,441 --> 00:16:00,874
Yes, Grandpa.

141
00:16:01,076 --> 00:16:03,340
<i>Cheer up, Nello</i>

142
00:16:04,479 --> 00:16:06,640
<i>Give me a smile</i>

143
00:16:08,249 --> 00:16:10,581
<i>Where's that smile</i>

144
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:13,544
<i>I used to know</i>

145
00:16:14,622 --> 00:16:18,820
<i>Soon skies are going to clear up, Nello</i>

146
00:16:19,694 --> 00:16:22,356
<i>Cheer up, Nello</i>

147
00:16:23,365 --> 00:16:25,560
<i>Just be</i>

148
00:16:25,767 --> 00:16:28,702
<i>Glad you're you</i>

149
00:16:59,401 --> 00:17:00,800
Cut it out.

150
00:17:12,213 --> 00:17:13,373
What is it?

151
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:17,445
Crazy dog!

152
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,948
- He wants to help.
- That's his nature.

153
00:17:22,157 --> 00:17:24,387
That is a dog's dog.

154
00:17:28,229 --> 00:17:32,131
Don't worry, Grandfather. You rest.
We'll do the milk run today.

155
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:34,460
A boy and a dog.

156
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:37,065
I don't stand a chance.

157
00:18:39,334 --> 00:18:40,801
There you go.

158
00:18:47,942 --> 00:18:50,001
Nothing like milk in the morning.

159
00:18:53,848 --> 00:18:56,009
He's healed up real nice.

160
00:18:56,384 --> 00:18:58,352
You did a good job with him.

161
00:18:58,553 --> 00:19:01,681
- What's your name, dog?
- Patrasche.

162
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:07,653
If you're going to be seen with Nello Daas
and bear his dear mother's birth name...

163
00:19:07,829 --> 00:19:12,163
...this rope will never do.
Leave him with old William for a while.

164
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:15,427
Go on. Go draw me a nice picture of Aloise.

165
00:19:15,603 --> 00:19:19,664
I don't work for free, you know?
We'll fix you right up here.

166
00:19:23,645 --> 00:19:25,613
Just think...

167
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:28,248
...my mother once sat right here.

168
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:30,008
Just like me.

169
00:19:31,186 --> 00:19:35,145
She was going to become a famous artist,
but then she got sick.

170
00:19:35,356 --> 00:19:40,419
I'm glad my mom never gets sick.
I don't know what I'd do without her.

171
00:19:44,098 --> 00:19:47,932
Come back. You're supposed to be modeling.

172
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:53,136
Well, models are supposed to get paid,
you know.

173
00:19:53,575 --> 00:19:55,702
Not if they don't sit still.

174
00:19:59,914 --> 00:20:01,506
Aloise, sit...

175
00:20:24,606 --> 00:20:27,040
Thank you, William. It's wonderful.

176
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:29,642
Such soft leather.

177
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:33,679
- Where did you get it?
- Where'd you get it, William?

178
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:36,678
- Your apron!
- Oh, no!

179
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:43,253
Look at your faces!
What have you been doing?

180
00:20:43,424 --> 00:20:45,688
Your father will blame me for sure.

181
00:20:46,394 --> 00:20:49,522
Aloise, your mother's been looking for you.

182
00:20:49,931 --> 00:20:51,694
Coming, Papa.

183
00:20:53,935 --> 00:20:56,927
Look at you.
Who's been painting your face?

184
00:20:57,105 --> 00:21:00,404
- Hello, Master Cogez.
- Nello, William.

185
00:21:00,775 --> 00:21:02,299
Say, "Bye-bye, Nello. "

186
00:21:02,477 --> 00:21:04,342
Say, "Bye-bye, William. "

187
00:21:07,248 --> 00:21:08,806
Look at you.

188
00:21:09,584 --> 00:21:12,144
Lucky man, Baas Cogez, huh?

189
00:21:12,954 --> 00:21:16,355
Get that milk to town before you
lose your customers.

190
00:21:16,524 --> 00:21:18,287
Clean your face on the way.

191
00:21:18,726 --> 00:21:21,160
- Thank you, William.
- All right.

192
00:21:54,796 --> 00:21:58,562
- Children! Children! Sit down.
- Hi, Aloise.

193
00:22:10,545 --> 00:22:13,708
There's a great painting
inside that cathedral.

194
00:22:13,881 --> 00:22:16,145
Grandpa says Mother once saw it.

195
00:22:17,819 --> 00:22:19,514
Wish I could see it too.

196
00:22:47,382 --> 00:22:52,046
- Are you an admirer of Rubens as well?
- Yes, sir. He's my hero.

197
00:22:52,253 --> 00:22:55,916
I'm sure the great master is happy to
see bright new eyes looking up at him.

198
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:57,951
I want to meet him.

199
00:22:58,493 --> 00:23:01,656
Rubens passed away many years ago.

200
00:23:01,829 --> 00:23:03,820
Of course, his art lives on.

201
00:23:03,998 --> 00:23:09,095
Great men and their deeds
always do live on.

202
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:11,101
And that's a comfort.

203
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:21,172
Please, sir.

204
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:25,319
Tell me more. I want to become
a great artist too.

205
00:23:25,486 --> 00:23:27,351
You do?

206
00:23:27,522 --> 00:23:30,286
Well, you've made a proper start.

207
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:33,894
Rubens was a master of every aspect of art.

208
00:23:34,061 --> 00:23:36,256
Composition, light...

209
00:23:36,531 --> 00:23:38,021
...movement.

210
00:23:38,199 --> 00:23:42,226
But he had to study.
He studied down there, around the corner.

211
00:23:42,403 --> 00:23:46,100
- Right here in this city?
- He was a great teacher as well.

212
00:23:46,274 --> 00:23:50,335
But what made him really great
was that he was interested...

213
00:23:50,511 --> 00:23:52,638
...and excited about everything.

214
00:23:53,147 --> 00:23:54,944
I'm like that.

215
00:23:55,683 --> 00:23:57,412
I'm sure you are.

216
00:23:57,585 --> 00:23:59,485
Michel!

217
00:24:00,154 --> 00:24:01,178
Milk?

218
00:24:01,722 --> 00:24:05,783
Artists of our caliber
should only drink cognac.

219
00:24:06,761 --> 00:24:10,128
Let's see what these characters
are up to, shall we?

220
00:24:12,266 --> 00:24:13,597
Robert Kessler...

221
00:24:14,001 --> 00:24:18,631
...may I present
Master Michel La Grande.

222
00:24:19,507 --> 00:24:22,499
I've studied your painting
in the town hall, sir.

223
00:24:22,677 --> 00:24:26,113
I believe you know his father,
our esteemed mayor.

224
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,804
Of course.

225
00:24:28,015 --> 00:24:32,008
Robert's been studying in London's
Royal Conservatory of Art.

226
00:24:32,186 --> 00:24:37,590
- As you can see, he has a lot of potential.
- You always had an eye for potential.

227
00:24:37,758 --> 00:24:40,226
Let me introduce you to my friend.

228
00:24:42,897 --> 00:24:44,626
Master Steerns. Robert.

229
00:24:44,999 --> 00:24:48,491
I don't suppose I know his father.
Do I?

230
00:24:48,769 --> 00:24:51,704
Dietrich, please.

231
00:24:51,873 --> 00:24:53,500
Yes, well...

232
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:59,103
I was prepared to show Robert Rubens'
greatest work, if you care to join us.

233
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,875
I was just on my way,
with my friend, Nello.

234
00:25:03,885 --> 00:25:05,853
Can Patrasche come too?

235
00:25:07,588 --> 00:25:09,579
The priest doesn't allow dogs.

236
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:12,657
He barely tolerates humans
unless they have...

237
00:25:12,827 --> 00:25:14,522
...potential.

238
00:25:14,695 --> 00:25:18,597
- So tie up your friend and then join us.
- Okay.

239
00:25:19,133 --> 00:25:20,566
Come, Patrasche.

240
00:25:23,971 --> 00:25:29,375
I'm starting a little salon on Tuesdays.
You should drop by for schnapps.

241
00:25:29,544 --> 00:25:32,570
I'm afraid I'll be busy for the next...

242
00:25:32,747 --> 00:25:34,977
...four or five years.

243
00:25:36,817 --> 00:25:39,581
That, my boy, is what we call
a brushoff.

244
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:44,484
Not at all. I'm going off to Rome
to paint some murals.

245
00:25:45,326 --> 00:25:47,988
A new commission from the Church.

246
00:25:48,663 --> 00:25:50,096
Really?

247
00:25:51,332 --> 00:25:52,799
Does his Holiness pay well?

248
00:25:52,967 --> 00:25:57,233
I myself would pay to paint
in the city of Michelangelo.

249
00:25:57,405 --> 00:25:59,202
Well, to each his own.

250
00:25:59,707 --> 00:26:02,301
This is the painting, behind the drape.

251
00:26:02,476 --> 00:26:04,273
Now, where's the priest?

252
00:26:06,247 --> 00:26:09,683
Father! We've come to see the Rubens.

253
00:26:10,484 --> 00:26:12,748
Does light hurt the painting?

254
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,580
On the contrary, young Robert.
It's light that brings a painting to life.

255
00:26:17,758 --> 00:26:19,783
So why does he keep it covered?

256
00:26:19,961 --> 00:26:25,194
It wasn't Rubens' idea. His paintings
were meant to be enjoyed by everyone.

257
00:26:25,366 --> 00:26:27,459
As if the masses were interested in art.

258
00:26:28,436 --> 00:26:30,028
Father.

259
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:39,911
Robert, you surely have a silver franc.

260
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:47,180
Bless you.

261
00:26:57,298 --> 00:26:58,959
This is the house of God!

262
00:27:04,105 --> 00:27:06,699
- Patrasche, no! Come!
- You!

263
00:27:07,942 --> 00:27:11,434
- You thief! Thief!
- Nello.

264
00:27:11,612 --> 00:27:13,045
Little sinner!

265
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:16,149
If you worried so much about souls
as you do silver...

266
00:27:16,317 --> 00:27:19,718
...there'd be no sinners in this city!

267
00:27:24,525 --> 00:27:26,015
It's all right!

268
00:27:33,768 --> 00:27:37,829
I was going to see Rubens'
greatest painting.

269
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:42,170
You found my darling dog.

270
00:27:44,945 --> 00:27:49,279
Your dog? I found him by the side
of the road. He was almost dead.

271
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:52,385
Either way, he is mine.

272
00:27:53,788 --> 00:27:54,846
He doesn't like you.

273
00:27:55,056 --> 00:27:57,320
As long as he obeys me, boy.

274
00:27:57,692 --> 00:27:59,785
Now, one way or another...

275
00:28:00,361 --> 00:28:03,194
...I am taking my animal back.

276
00:28:03,798 --> 00:28:05,129
Understand me, boy?

277
00:28:05,299 --> 00:28:06,857
You understand me?!

278
00:28:07,068 --> 00:28:08,365
Run, Patrasche, run!

279
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:27,413
- You try to run from me?
- Stop!

280
00:28:27,655 --> 00:28:29,054
I'll teach you better than that!

281
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:31,689
This dog is mine!

282
00:28:31,992 --> 00:28:32,981
It's my dog.

283
00:28:33,427 --> 00:28:34,758
You stole him from me!

284
00:28:35,262 --> 00:28:38,254
Now, get away or I'll cut your damn
heart out!

285
00:28:39,667 --> 00:28:42,659
No, Patrasche is mine!
You left him to die!

286
00:28:43,637 --> 00:28:48,165
Let that dog be! Leave him alone!
Get behind me! Get back behind me!

287
00:28:48,342 --> 00:28:51,243
You want trouble, peddler?
You've got it!

288
00:28:51,412 --> 00:28:52,436
Come on!

289
00:28:54,982 --> 00:28:57,177
Are you insane?!

290
00:28:58,652 --> 00:29:00,552
Nello, are you all right?

291
00:29:01,689 --> 00:29:03,316
Look out!

292
00:29:36,557 --> 00:29:38,354
It's over.

293
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:40,118
It's done.

294
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:50,231
Nello, come with me.

295
00:29:57,278 --> 00:29:59,940
You're a brave dog, Patrasche.

296
00:30:00,114 --> 00:30:02,446
When can I take my bandage off?

297
00:30:02,616 --> 00:30:06,575
Keep it on for a while.
Keeps the dirt from the cut.

298
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:12,951
Are you a great artist, sir?

299
00:30:13,294 --> 00:30:15,387
I strive to be, Nello.

300
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:17,893
But perhaps not.

301
00:30:19,166 --> 00:30:21,430
I think you're great, sir.

302
00:30:22,269 --> 00:30:23,429
I thank you.

303
00:30:26,307 --> 00:30:30,334
- But Rubens was the best, though, right?
- Rubens was a genius.

304
00:30:31,645 --> 00:30:34,910
- Is that greater than great?
- Genius is a greatness...

305
00:30:35,082 --> 00:30:37,744
...that burns like an eternal flame.

306
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:45,590
That's you. I like that one.

307
00:30:46,093 --> 00:30:47,822
You have good taste.

308
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:52,692
A very gifted student drew that for me.

309
00:30:53,167 --> 00:30:54,498
Did he become great?

310
00:30:56,136 --> 00:30:58,127
She could've been.

311
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,633
But as you know, Nello...

312
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:07,008
...in our society, no one lets you forget
what station you're from.

313
00:31:07,181 --> 00:31:09,411
Especially for a woman.

314
00:31:09,917 --> 00:31:13,182
She was from a poor family.

315
00:31:16,423 --> 00:31:18,084
She was young.

316
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:20,651
I was foolish.

317
00:31:21,328 --> 00:31:23,489
I let her get away.

318
00:31:26,934 --> 00:31:28,663
Master La Grande?

319
00:31:32,172 --> 00:31:34,606
I have a friend, Aloise.

320
00:31:34,775 --> 00:31:36,299
She models for me.

321
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:39,742
- Would you like to see her picture?
- Of course.

322
00:31:53,627 --> 00:31:56,460
- You drew this?
- Is it any good?

323
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:02,326
It's exceptional.

324
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:04,630
Especially for a boy your age.

325
00:32:05,873 --> 00:32:09,809
Perspective is off here and there,
but that comes with study.

326
00:32:09,977 --> 00:32:12,605
Do you ever give lessons
in exchange for work?

327
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:16,772
I'd be so honored, but I'm off to Rome.

328
00:32:17,217 --> 00:32:20,448
What about your friend?
Does she give lessons?

329
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:24,685
She went away. I never saw her again.

330
00:32:24,858 --> 00:32:27,827
But, anyway, you don't need lessons
right now.

331
00:32:28,062 --> 00:32:32,328
The main thing is to keep drawing
from your heart the way you do.

332
00:32:32,499 --> 00:32:34,091
Examine, look at things.

333
00:32:34,268 --> 00:32:38,068
The greater part of drawing comes
before you touch the paper.

334
00:32:38,238 --> 00:32:41,207
Ask questions, find out
what things are made of.

335
00:32:41,375 --> 00:32:45,334
Store information for the inner eye,
the eye of the intuition.

336
00:32:45,879 --> 00:32:48,973
Is that how Rubens did it?
I want to become like him.

337
00:32:49,149 --> 00:32:51,777
That's good. Always reach for the stars.

338
00:32:51,952 --> 00:32:54,614
You could be great, Nello. Why not?

339
00:32:54,788 --> 00:32:57,518
Do you believe you could be great?

340
00:32:58,092 --> 00:32:59,650
Maybe.

341
00:33:00,894 --> 00:33:02,452
Good.

342
00:33:40,367 --> 00:33:42,130
Slow down!

343
00:33:42,302 --> 00:33:44,133
I don't believe this.

344
00:33:46,106 --> 00:33:50,805
Aloise, we talked about you racing
through the fields. There's work to be done.

345
00:33:50,978 --> 00:33:54,379
Nello says when he's a great artist,
I'll never push a cart again.

346
00:33:54,548 --> 00:33:55,742
Down you get.

347
00:33:56,984 --> 00:34:01,717
Most artists would be happy to settle
for enough to eat. Did he tell you that?

348
00:34:01,889 --> 00:34:06,053
Peter Paul Rubens was great and rich.
Nello knows all about him.

349
00:34:06,226 --> 00:34:08,524
Nello can't even read or write.

350
00:34:08,695 --> 00:34:12,028
So I'll teach him, and he'll use me
as his model to paint.

351
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:13,791
He's such a good artist, Papa.

352
00:34:13,967 --> 00:34:16,128
I don't want Nello filling
your mind with nonsense.

353
00:34:16,303 --> 00:34:20,296
No more riding. You've got work to do.
He'll have to find another model.

354
00:34:20,841 --> 00:34:22,240
Come on.

355
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:28,604
Your father just wants what's best.
All fathers do.

356
00:34:28,782 --> 00:34:32,741
- Why doesn't he like Nello?
- He likes Nello.

357
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,582
He just remembers what it was like
when he was poor.

358
00:34:35,756 --> 00:34:38,054
How hard life can be.

359
00:34:38,225 --> 00:34:40,523
Money doesn't make people happy.

360
00:34:40,694 --> 00:34:44,562
Nello and his grandfather,
they're poor and they're happy.

361
00:34:46,066 --> 00:34:48,227
You are so smart.

362
00:34:48,435 --> 00:34:51,029
I don't know who you take after.

363
00:34:52,339 --> 00:34:55,866
Nello will be great. I know he will.

364
00:34:56,810 --> 00:35:00,302
Of course he will.
He has you to believe in him.

365
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:09,519
Is that you?

366
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:11,719
Master La Grande.

367
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,222
You're home.

368
00:35:14,962 --> 00:35:17,829
Yes and no. I must return to Rome.

369
00:35:20,934 --> 00:35:23,596
But not for long. The bishop wants
a smaller nose, that's all.

370
00:35:24,004 --> 00:35:26,837
But look at you. I barely recognized you.

371
00:35:27,007 --> 00:35:30,841
Of course, I recognized your friend,
Patrasche.

372
00:35:31,678 --> 00:35:35,580
And your model hasn't changed a bit.
Master Rubens.

373
00:35:35,749 --> 00:35:37,273
But let's see.

374
00:35:37,451 --> 00:35:40,443
Let's see how you are doing.

375
00:35:48,462 --> 00:35:51,488
Your eye has grown clear
and your hand strong.

376
00:35:51,665 --> 00:35:54,759
You've cared wisely for your talent.

377
00:35:54,935 --> 00:35:58,871
Perhaps it's time to graduate to painting.

378
00:35:59,173 --> 00:36:00,902
Painting?

379
00:36:01,542 --> 00:36:03,203
Perhaps it's time.

380
00:36:10,884 --> 00:36:11,976
Good.

381
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:17,486
This is for you as well.
I was all prepared, you see.

382
00:36:18,458 --> 00:36:20,358
And the brushes.

383
00:36:21,161 --> 00:36:23,129
You'll need many brushes.

384
00:36:30,737 --> 00:36:32,398
Those are all for me?

385
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:36,103
Tools of the trade for a fellow artist.

386
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:38,310
Early Christmas present.

387
00:36:39,646 --> 00:36:42,513
I've never seen so many
beautiful things before.

388
00:36:43,584 --> 00:36:46,075
Those pigments are very strong.
Here...

389
00:36:46,253 --> 00:36:48,187
...try one color at a time.

390
00:36:48,689 --> 00:36:50,714
Place it next to other colors...

391
00:36:50,891 --> 00:36:54,088
...mix them, fall in love with the colors.

392
00:36:54,261 --> 00:36:56,456
And then look at nature...

393
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:58,723
...and your surroundings.

394
00:36:59,433 --> 00:37:01,367
See how these colors are reflected.

395
00:37:01,535 --> 00:37:04,527
How many colors, for instance,
in your blouse?

396
00:37:05,939 --> 00:37:08,533
Let's see. Blue, of course.

397
00:37:10,611 --> 00:37:12,602
There's white.

398
00:37:12,779 --> 00:37:14,906
But it has other colors as well.

399
00:37:17,351 --> 00:37:21,515
But, also, a little green will bring it
to that shade exactly.

400
00:37:23,257 --> 00:37:24,781
Experiment.

401
00:37:25,259 --> 00:37:26,692
Here.

402
00:37:27,628 --> 00:37:31,064
Sometimes at the end of a day
I have 30 colors...

403
00:37:31,231 --> 00:37:34,394
...in my palette, different shades.

404
00:37:35,569 --> 00:37:38,436
Now for a box for you.

405
00:37:42,376 --> 00:37:44,071
What?

406
00:37:45,045 --> 00:37:46,910
The city fathers...

407
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:51,608
...sponsor a Rubens Junior Art Contest
each Christmas.

408
00:37:51,952 --> 00:37:53,715
You must enter it.

409
00:37:56,556 --> 00:37:58,683
I could never win.

410
00:37:59,926 --> 00:38:01,223
What's that?

411
00:38:01,595 --> 00:38:03,893
Is that my pupil speaking?

412
00:38:06,099 --> 00:38:07,498
How could I?

413
00:38:07,768 --> 00:38:10,999
The first step to winning
is believing you can win.

414
00:38:11,271 --> 00:38:13,239
Of course you can win, Nello.

415
00:38:14,608 --> 00:38:16,667
It's too late for me.

416
00:38:17,644 --> 00:38:21,671
There's plenty of time before Christmas.
You can do it.

417
00:38:21,915 --> 00:38:24,884
I mean it's too late for me
to start my art studies.

418
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:26,679
Nonsense.

419
00:38:26,853 --> 00:38:30,687
Rubens himself was older than you
when he started.

420
00:38:30,857 --> 00:38:32,518
- Really?
- Really.

421
00:38:32,693 --> 00:38:34,957
And did I forget to mention...

422
00:38:35,562 --> 00:38:38,554
...that the winner gets 1000 silver francs...

423
00:38:38,732 --> 00:38:41,257
...and a scholarship to art school?

424
00:38:41,635 --> 00:38:43,159
Did you hear that, Patrasche?

425
00:38:46,506 --> 00:38:48,701
One thousand silver francs.

426
00:38:48,975 --> 00:38:52,968
And he's going to win it, Patrasche.
He's going to win it.

427
00:39:02,389 --> 00:39:04,949
Hi, Nello. I made you some cookies.

428
00:39:05,125 --> 00:39:08,720
They're not that good, though.
Mother says I ride better than I cook.

429
00:39:08,895 --> 00:39:11,830
Papa thought the heart-shaped
cookie was for him.

430
00:39:11,998 --> 00:39:14,466
And this one's for Patrasche.

431
00:39:15,369 --> 00:39:16,358
Thanks, but...

432
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:19,000
...they're too pretty to eat.

433
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:22,335
I've got something for you too.

434
00:39:28,248 --> 00:39:30,239
It's beautiful.

435
00:39:31,017 --> 00:39:34,350
- What is it?
- It's what it will be that matters.

436
00:39:34,521 --> 00:39:38,423
<i>I'll call it Portrait of a Princess.</i>

437
00:40:06,787 --> 00:40:08,687
It's beautiful.

438
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:12,988
I feel so small when I look up at the sky.

439
00:40:13,827 --> 00:40:15,351
Really?

440
00:40:15,529 --> 00:40:19,363
Why are some people born rich,
some poor...

441
00:40:19,533 --> 00:40:21,194
...some healthy...

442
00:40:21,968 --> 00:40:23,993
...some real sick?

443
00:40:24,538 --> 00:40:25,800
It just isn't fair.

444
00:40:26,139 --> 00:40:28,607
I really hadn't thought much about that yet.

445
00:40:32,746 --> 00:40:35,146
Ever since my mother died...

446
00:40:35,315 --> 00:40:37,283
...I've wondered where she went.

447
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:43,486
Maybe she's one of those real bright
stars that come out every night.

448
00:40:44,691 --> 00:40:46,158
I hope so.

449
00:40:47,427 --> 00:40:51,295
It wouldn't be right if the spirit
of a great man like Rubens...

450
00:40:51,465 --> 00:40:55,128
...and good people like my mother
just didn't go on after they died.

451
00:40:56,503 --> 00:40:58,528
I'm sure you're right, Nello.

452
00:40:58,705 --> 00:41:00,639
God's too smart for that.

453
00:41:15,188 --> 00:41:17,884
- I'd better go.
- It's time to go, Aloise.

454
00:41:18,091 --> 00:41:21,060
Meet me here tomorrow night,
and I'll finish your sketch.

455
00:41:21,261 --> 00:41:22,888
All right, Nello.

456
00:41:34,608 --> 00:41:37,941
You're going to be a great artist,
just like Rubens.

457
00:41:40,814 --> 00:41:42,247
Listen.

458
00:41:43,984 --> 00:41:45,417
Can you hear it?

459
00:41:49,155 --> 00:41:50,452
Yes.

460
00:41:51,658 --> 00:41:53,148
Music.

461
00:41:56,296 --> 00:41:57,661
It's the circus.

462
00:41:58,131 --> 00:42:00,964
I saw them pass earlier
on the way to the city.

463
00:42:01,835 --> 00:42:05,635
Papa says circus people stuff little
girls in sacks and sell them.

464
00:42:05,805 --> 00:42:07,602
Like grain? That's silly.

465
00:42:07,774 --> 00:42:10,709
They travel and play games
and make people happy.

466
00:42:10,877 --> 00:42:12,139
How could they be bad?

467
00:42:12,712 --> 00:42:13,974
I don't know.

468
00:42:15,448 --> 00:42:17,712
I better get you home first.

469
00:42:20,387 --> 00:42:24,016
Nello Daas, if you're not afraid,
I'm not afraid.

470
00:43:09,069 --> 00:43:11,128
Maybe we should go back.

471
00:43:12,405 --> 00:43:14,771
Are you kidding? This is great.

472
00:44:13,099 --> 00:44:14,794
Come on, Nello.

473
00:44:24,911 --> 00:44:28,642
You will be great one day, little one.

474
00:44:28,815 --> 00:44:32,945
Your life and love will touch many.

475
00:44:33,186 --> 00:44:35,677
Your stars are crossed.

476
00:44:36,389 --> 00:44:38,289
Your hearts beat as one.

477
00:44:38,792 --> 00:44:42,023
You have known each other before.

478
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:48,289
In this life, you will finally
find true happiness.

479
00:46:24,764 --> 00:46:27,460
Where are you?
Can you hear me?

480
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:31,962
Answer me!

481
00:46:43,616 --> 00:46:45,709
Oh, my God! Thank God you're all right.

482
00:46:45,885 --> 00:46:48,479
I'm sorry, Papa. I fell asleep.

483
00:46:48,888 --> 00:46:52,255
Master Cogez, it was all my fault.
I wanted to draw her picture.

484
00:46:52,425 --> 00:46:56,418
Do you have any idea how worried
we've been? Any idea at all?

485
00:46:57,063 --> 00:46:59,896
- It was my fault.
- I'll deal with you later.

486
00:47:00,066 --> 00:47:02,034
You're thoughtless and irresponsible.

487
00:47:02,202 --> 00:47:06,138
Aloise is our life. I won't let you
jeopardize that. Do you understand me?

488
00:47:25,758 --> 00:47:28,488
Millie, take Aloise inside, please.

489
00:47:30,196 --> 00:47:32,596
Nello, would you come here?

490
00:47:42,709 --> 00:47:44,802
That picture you did of Aloise.

491
00:47:44,978 --> 00:47:48,880
The painting is foolish, but it does
look like her, and my wife likes it.

492
00:47:51,918 --> 00:47:53,579
I'll buy it from you.

493
00:47:55,688 --> 00:47:57,121
It's not for sale.

494
00:48:01,027 --> 00:48:02,654
So be it.

495
00:48:04,864 --> 00:48:07,628
- Fetch the boy's picture.
- Master Cogez.

496
00:48:08,201 --> 00:48:09,361
It's a present.

497
00:48:09,936 --> 00:48:12,131
I want you to stay away from my daughter.

498
00:48:12,505 --> 00:48:16,202
- But Aloise is my friend.
- You're not welcome here anymore.

499
00:48:22,949 --> 00:48:25,144
Because of last night?

500
00:48:25,718 --> 00:48:26,946
No.

501
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:29,111
Because it's for the best.

502
00:48:31,057 --> 00:48:32,183
Best for who, sir?

503
00:48:56,282 --> 00:49:00,412
I could've seen the Rubens
with that silver franc.

504
00:49:03,623 --> 00:49:05,614
I couldn't sell her picture.

505
00:49:08,027 --> 00:49:10,086
One day when we're great, Patrasche...

506
00:49:11,864 --> 00:49:14,924
...Aloise's drawing will be worth its
weight in silver.

507
00:49:21,174 --> 00:49:22,641
Don't cry. I'll talk to him.

508
00:49:32,618 --> 00:49:35,553
You're right to be upset with them,
but you've gone too far.

509
00:49:35,722 --> 00:49:37,212
She'll get over it.

510
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:40,325
- Nello's like a brother to her.
- Brother? Anna, come on!

511
00:49:40,493 --> 00:49:43,053
- You know where this is going.
- Lf it did come to pass...

512
00:49:43,229 --> 00:49:46,824
...would that be so terrible?
Nello is a fine, hardworking boy...

513
00:49:47,367 --> 00:49:48,834
He's an orphan.

514
00:49:50,770 --> 00:49:52,863
No girl can do better than to be happy.

515
00:49:53,039 --> 00:49:56,531
Even if it means marrying a tinker's son,
like you were.

516
00:49:57,276 --> 00:50:01,007
I married you for love.
I went against my father's wishes.

517
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:04,343
And I didn't judge you because you
were poor and had dreams.

518
00:50:04,517 --> 00:50:07,350
I had ambitions.
This boy dreams of being an artist.

519
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:08,987
What kind of future is that?

520
00:50:09,155 --> 00:50:11,885
I turned your father's simple farm
into a prosperous mill.

521
00:50:12,058 --> 00:50:15,789
Is it so wrong for a father
to want more for his daughter?

522
00:50:15,962 --> 00:50:20,956
But this mill will provide for Aloise, always.

523
00:50:22,135 --> 00:50:25,298
You forget.
I know what it's like to be poor.

524
00:50:36,149 --> 00:50:39,050
It's Aloise's birthday soon.

525
00:50:39,218 --> 00:50:41,083
I made her something.

526
00:50:41,587 --> 00:50:43,555
I'm not going this year.

527
00:50:49,429 --> 00:50:52,159
Master Cogez is a strong man...

528
00:50:52,331 --> 00:50:54,765
...but you know there is good there.

529
00:50:55,935 --> 00:50:59,769
He just wants the best for Aloise.

530
00:51:06,612 --> 00:51:10,446
Master Cogez thinks that money
is all that's important.

531
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:14,950
Poor, my boy.

532
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:17,555
Being poor is hard on you.

533
00:51:17,723 --> 00:51:20,715
We've lots. We've Patrasche and each other.

534
00:51:20,893 --> 00:51:23,259
I don't care what he thinks.

535
00:51:27,633 --> 00:51:31,626
A little more food would not be
disagreeable, though, would it?

536
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:40,643
One day we will all be with God
and realize this was just a dream.

537
00:51:41,547 --> 00:51:43,777
Just one big dream.

538
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:46,942
Sometimes good, sometimes bad.

539
00:51:47,653 --> 00:51:50,247
Will we really all be together again
after we die?

540
00:51:50,423 --> 00:51:52,618
Of course!

541
00:51:52,792 --> 00:51:55,090
Our real home is with God.

542
00:51:55,261 --> 00:51:59,789
And he will not be happy
until we all come back to him.

543
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,333
Then I will see Mother again?

544
00:52:15,414 --> 00:52:16,847
But remember:

545
00:52:17,016 --> 00:52:18,278
She's here now.

546
00:52:18,784 --> 00:52:22,117
Always with you, even though
you can't see her.

547
00:52:51,717 --> 00:52:53,981
Here she is, the birthday girl.

548
00:53:17,310 --> 00:53:19,437
Thank you for the lovely gift for Aloise.

549
00:53:19,612 --> 00:53:23,070
And so then I threw the old fool out...

550
00:53:23,249 --> 00:53:25,774
...and then I bought her house for nothing.

551
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:28,915
- Sir?
- Thank you, Millie.

552
00:53:32,925 --> 00:53:34,017
Thank you.

553
00:53:39,565 --> 00:53:42,193
You look very beautiful tonight, Millie.

554
00:53:45,104 --> 00:53:47,038
Olga, thank you very much for coming.

555
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:52,773
Sweetheart, you go on ahead.
I have business to discuss with Nicholas.

556
00:53:53,379 --> 00:53:55,677
Business tonight?
Discuss something tonight?

557
00:53:55,848 --> 00:53:58,715
I won't have my wits about me.
Not after this much ale.

558
00:53:58,884 --> 00:54:01,512
Exactly, my friend! Exactly.

559
00:54:01,687 --> 00:54:05,555
Because you are too sly for me
when you are sober.

560
00:54:07,426 --> 00:54:09,621
You've had enough.

561
00:54:10,563 --> 00:54:14,124
I know when I have had enough.

562
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:18,259
Don't you ever tell me how to do
my business, woman!

563
00:54:18,437 --> 00:54:20,132
Now you go on home.

564
00:55:16,962 --> 00:55:18,691
Happy birthday, Aloise.

565
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:25,128
How pretty. I love it.

566
00:55:25,304 --> 00:55:30,469
- It's hard not seeing you anymore.
- I know. For me too.

567
00:55:30,643 --> 00:55:33,806
After the art contest,
everything will be different.

568
00:55:33,979 --> 00:55:36,277
I pray every night for God to let you win.

569
00:55:37,350 --> 00:55:39,875
Then I can't lose, Aloise.

570
00:55:58,137 --> 00:55:59,729
Fire!

571
00:56:02,408 --> 00:56:04,000
Fire!

572
00:56:26,298 --> 00:56:27,765
Oh, dear God!

573
00:56:28,033 --> 00:56:29,091
Oh, dear God!

574
00:56:30,302 --> 00:56:32,862
The house and the barn could go next!

575
00:56:38,444 --> 00:56:39,775
Everybody get in a line!

576
00:56:41,514 --> 00:56:43,448
Get to the stream! Get the buckets!

577
00:56:43,649 --> 00:56:46,379
Millie, get the buckets! Get the buckets!

578
00:57:24,156 --> 00:57:25,919
- Help!
- I'm trying!

579
00:57:37,236 --> 00:57:38,965
Grandfather!

580
00:57:43,275 --> 00:57:44,970
What are you doing?

581
00:57:52,084 --> 00:57:55,485
These old bones can still help a neighbor.

582
00:57:58,290 --> 00:57:59,382
Someone!

583
00:57:59,558 --> 00:58:00,650
Someone!

584
00:58:07,766 --> 00:58:10,394
- I'm going to lose everything!
- Someone!

585
00:58:10,569 --> 00:58:13,265
Stephens! Get on the pump!

586
00:58:49,508 --> 00:58:50,600
More!

587
00:58:50,809 --> 00:58:51,935
More!

588
00:59:37,189 --> 00:59:40,317
- Water?
- Yes.

589
00:59:41,126 --> 00:59:42,753
Thank you, William.

590
00:59:43,596 --> 00:59:46,929
I owe you, William. Without your help,
we'd have lost the barn too.

591
00:59:47,132 --> 00:59:49,191
Are you all right, Grandfather?

592
00:59:51,770 --> 00:59:53,397
A little winded.

593
00:59:56,041 --> 00:59:58,066
Don't you find it mysterious?

594
00:59:58,243 --> 01:00:01,076
I looked. I found no broken lantern.

595
01:00:01,246 --> 01:00:05,649
How could fresh, stored grain
burst into flames all by itself?

596
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:11,213
You mean someone started the fire
deliberately?

597
01:00:11,390 --> 01:00:15,053
Does anybody have any idea who may have
visited here after Aloise's party?

598
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:18,354
You always see the worst in things.
Accidents happen.

599
01:00:18,530 --> 01:00:21,522
This was no accident.

600
01:00:22,735 --> 01:00:24,202
Come here, boy.

601
01:00:24,870 --> 01:00:26,303
Come here!

602
01:00:29,508 --> 01:00:32,409
You were looking for revenge,
weren't you, boy?

603
01:00:32,578 --> 01:00:36,275
For Master Cogez not allowing you
to see Aloise.

604
01:00:37,483 --> 01:00:39,144
Was Nello here last night?

605
01:00:43,288 --> 01:00:44,812
What are you holding?

606
01:00:44,990 --> 01:00:46,150
Where did you get that?

607
01:00:47,359 --> 01:00:49,122
Where did she get that?

608
01:00:49,528 --> 01:00:51,018
Did you see my daughter last night?

609
01:00:52,798 --> 01:00:56,097
I don't believe this.
Are you responsible for this fire?

610
01:00:56,802 --> 01:01:00,932
Do you really think that Nello
could do such a thing?

611
01:01:01,373 --> 01:01:04,740
People will go to any lengths for
revenge.

612
01:01:04,910 --> 01:01:06,741
I was in bed when the fire started!

613
01:01:06,979 --> 01:01:10,813
- You started the fire.
- Nello could never have done such a thing.

614
01:01:11,050 --> 01:01:14,178
Wait a minute, Anna. Stephens is right.

615
01:01:15,054 --> 01:01:18,023
The boy started the fire
because he was angry with me.

616
01:01:18,757 --> 01:01:21,021
- I did not!
- You're a liar!

617
01:01:24,263 --> 01:01:26,663
On what grounds do you attack my grandson?

618
01:01:31,437 --> 01:01:32,870
A birthday present?

619
01:01:34,473 --> 01:01:36,304
I brought the puppet, but that was all.

620
01:01:36,475 --> 01:01:40,036
Proof! There you have it! There is your proof.

621
01:01:46,118 --> 01:01:49,417
But I didn't do it! I didn't start that fire!

622
01:01:49,722 --> 01:01:50,711
Please believe me!

623
01:02:22,588 --> 01:02:24,681
No one will do business with me.

624
01:02:24,923 --> 01:02:26,413
I know, lad.

625
01:02:27,192 --> 01:02:30,753
Stephens' man was already here.
He's taken over your milk run.

626
01:02:31,497 --> 01:02:34,261
So that's who's been doing my deliveries.

627
01:02:34,867 --> 01:02:38,268
I have some chairs. You and Patrasche
can deliver them for me.

628
01:02:38,437 --> 01:02:41,600
I'll give you money. Let's get rid of
your cans. You can leave them here.

629
01:02:41,774 --> 01:02:43,503
Why don't you ask Stephens' helper?

630
01:02:43,675 --> 01:02:44,903
Well...

631
01:02:45,377 --> 01:02:47,743
...since I decided to quit drinking milk
this morning...

632
01:02:47,913 --> 01:02:50,347
...Stephens and I aren't on speaking terms.

633
01:02:50,516 --> 01:02:52,347
Of course, we were never very close.

634
01:02:52,518 --> 01:02:53,712
Come on.

635
01:03:15,374 --> 01:03:16,898
Rosa!

636
01:03:40,599 --> 01:03:43,727
After your mother died, a part of your
grandfather died too.

637
01:03:44,336 --> 01:03:45,803
And some of me.

638
01:03:47,539 --> 01:03:50,372
Your mother was a very special person.

639
01:03:52,377 --> 01:03:54,106
What was she like?

640
01:03:55,013 --> 01:03:56,742
Always smiling.

641
01:03:57,182 --> 01:04:00,709
A hard life. Devil knows what she had to
smile about, but...

642
01:04:00,986 --> 01:04:03,386
...oh, she could light up a room.

643
01:04:05,824 --> 01:04:07,758
I wish I could have known her.

644
01:04:10,229 --> 01:04:12,493
If you know yourself, you know her.

645
01:04:15,334 --> 01:04:17,564
When I win the art contest...

646
01:04:18,003 --> 01:04:20,494
...everybody will know Nello Daas...

647
01:04:20,772 --> 01:04:22,535
...son of Mary...

648
01:04:22,908 --> 01:04:24,500
...grandson of Jehan.

649
01:04:24,743 --> 01:04:27,473
- Everyone.
- Everyone.

650
01:04:30,249 --> 01:04:32,342
Grandpa left this to me.

651
01:04:38,323 --> 01:04:40,188
It's from your mother.

652
01:04:42,694 --> 01:04:44,457
"Dearest Father:

653
01:04:44,997 --> 01:04:49,627
How long I've wanted to write you
but could not find the words.

654
01:04:50,369 --> 01:04:51,996
I had to leave. "

655
01:04:52,504 --> 01:04:54,665
<i>I hope you'll understand.</i>

656
01:04:54,973 --> 01:04:58,966
<i>I did not want to hurt you or cause
anyone disgrace.</i>

657
01:04:59,144 --> 01:05:01,476
<i>God has his reasons...</i>

658
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:03,409
<i>...of that I am sure.</i>

659
01:05:04,116 --> 01:05:08,519
<i>The birth of my son was the most joyful
day of my life.</i>

660
01:05:08,754 --> 01:05:12,485
<i>It proves to me that real happiness
comes not from our possessions...</i>

661
01:05:12,658 --> 01:05:15,752
<i>...or our positions, but from within.</i>

662
01:05:16,595 --> 01:05:21,362
<i>Father, I so look forward to sitting
with you again by the water...</i>

663
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:26,367
<i>...watching the boats pass, with your
beautiful grandson on your lap.</i>

664
01:05:27,873 --> 01:05:31,274
<i>I heard Anna had a daughter named Aloise.</i>

665
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:33,671
<i>Please give them my love.</i>

666
01:05:35,414 --> 01:05:39,214
"Did Nicholas Cogez start building
his windmill?

667
01:05:40,052 --> 01:05:42,316
Well, for now I must go.

668
01:05:43,855 --> 01:05:48,792
Give everyone my very best wishes
for a happy, healthy Christmas.

669
01:05:49,027 --> 01:05:53,088
Love always, your daughter, Mary.

670
01:05:53,865 --> 01:05:57,357
P.S. His name is Nello. "

671
01:06:00,472 --> 01:06:02,838
Why not come back to the shop
and have a bite?

672
01:06:03,008 --> 01:06:04,976
You could stay the night.

673
01:06:07,746 --> 01:06:09,976
I could use the company.

674
01:06:13,318 --> 01:06:15,081
Thank you...

675
01:06:16,755 --> 01:06:19,451
...but I've something very important to do.

676
01:08:00,025 --> 01:08:03,392
Please, sir! Here's my painting
for the Rubens Art Contest.

677
01:08:03,562 --> 01:08:06,622
I'm sorry, the deadline passed
three minutes ago.

678
01:08:06,798 --> 01:08:08,663
No, but I must win.

679
01:08:08,834 --> 01:08:10,597
Perhaps next year.

680
01:08:10,769 --> 01:08:13,431
I have to win this year! It's my only hope.

681
01:08:13,605 --> 01:08:16,540
I'm sorry. I'm late and my family is waiting.

682
01:08:16,708 --> 01:08:18,300
Please, sir.

683
01:08:27,018 --> 01:08:28,246
This is...

684
01:08:29,521 --> 01:08:30,988
...very good.

685
01:08:31,790 --> 01:08:33,155
This is...

686
01:08:34,392 --> 01:08:35,984
...really good.

687
01:08:38,263 --> 01:08:39,491
I'll take it.

688
01:08:39,664 --> 01:08:41,564
Thank you, sir.

689
01:08:42,167 --> 01:08:44,795
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas to you, sir.

690
01:08:44,970 --> 01:08:45,959
Good luck.

691
01:08:47,839 --> 01:08:50,535
You're late again on the rent, boy.

692
01:08:50,709 --> 01:08:54,736
- How many times have I warned you?
- I still have to pay off Grandfather's funeral.

693
01:08:55,180 --> 01:08:58,581
I am not interested in your troubles.

694
01:08:58,750 --> 01:09:00,411
You will have to leave.

695
01:09:00,585 --> 01:09:03,452
As for this month's, I'll settle for the dog.

696
01:09:03,889 --> 01:09:06,153
No! He's my best friend.

697
01:09:07,726 --> 01:09:09,887
You can't afford to feed yourself.

698
01:09:10,295 --> 01:09:12,957
When I win, we'll have
all the money we need.

699
01:09:13,465 --> 01:09:18,334
- You are a dreamer. Just like your mother.
- My mother was a great woman.

700
01:09:18,670 --> 01:09:20,604
Keep the dog. I'll take this.

701
01:09:22,374 --> 01:09:27,402
And you leave me every miserable scrap
that you own.

702
01:09:27,579 --> 01:09:31,037
I want you out of here by the morning.

703
01:09:31,616 --> 01:09:35,780
- But I've no place to go, sir.
- You are not my responsibility!

704
01:09:35,954 --> 01:09:40,323
Don't blame me for your miserable life, boy.
Blame your mother.

705
01:09:40,492 --> 01:09:43,461
Out of here by the morning.

706
01:10:08,153 --> 01:10:10,553
Why not wait until after Christmas
to rebuild?

707
01:10:10,722 --> 01:10:14,488
Because with what we lost in the fire,
I have to work the mill twice as much.

708
01:10:14,726 --> 01:10:17,126
Besides, I have nowhere to store the grain.

709
01:10:17,696 --> 01:10:22,099
I should never have let you borrow on
the farm to build that damn windmill.

710
01:10:22,467 --> 01:10:27,234
Really? Well, you like your city-bought
party dresses well enough.

711
01:10:30,008 --> 01:10:31,976
I liked our simple life.

712
01:10:32,143 --> 01:10:35,169
I liked the man I married.

713
01:10:35,347 --> 01:10:40,341
You've become just like Stephens,
driven by the money instead of your heart.

714
01:10:40,518 --> 01:10:43,351
My duty is to provide for my family.

715
01:10:45,056 --> 01:10:50,392
It takes more than money to provide
for your family, Nicholas.

716
01:11:50,488 --> 01:11:53,651
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.

717
01:11:54,292 --> 01:11:58,820
Every Christmas, nothing gives me
more pleasure...

718
01:11:59,030 --> 01:12:02,261
Well, let's say, almost nothing...

719
01:12:03,435 --> 01:12:09,032
Than the Peter Paul Rubens
Young People's Art Competition.

720
01:12:09,207 --> 01:12:12,802
For without Rubens, what would our city be?

721
01:12:12,977 --> 01:12:15,468
It would be like a Christmas without...

722
01:12:15,647 --> 01:12:19,139
...roasted pheasant, plum pudding,
fine wine.

723
01:12:19,517 --> 01:12:21,747
Cold ale! Hail ale!

724
01:12:25,623 --> 01:12:29,150
Moving right along, with our
esteemed judges...

725
01:12:29,327 --> 01:12:32,057
...Masters Steerns, Van Wyck...

726
01:12:32,330 --> 01:12:36,061
...and, rejoining our fair city
after a long absence...

727
01:12:36,234 --> 01:12:38,668
...Michel La Grande.

728
01:12:46,478 --> 01:12:51,780
Please, Master La Grande, say a few words
and announce the winner, please.

729
01:12:54,552 --> 01:12:56,110
Mayor Kessler.

730
01:12:56,788 --> 01:12:59,723
Perhaps it's better if Master Steerns speaks.

731
01:13:00,558 --> 01:13:02,458
Nonsense!

732
01:13:03,061 --> 01:13:06,792
"Wisdom before beauty," or whatever.

733
01:13:07,165 --> 01:13:08,598
Go on.

734
01:13:13,371 --> 01:13:15,236
It has been written:

735
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:17,471
"All nations...

736
01:13:18,443 --> 01:13:21,640
...closely should you treasure
your great men...

737
01:13:21,813 --> 01:13:25,180
...for by them alone
will the future know you. "

738
01:13:25,417 --> 01:13:28,545
In this our city has been wise.

739
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:32,178
She glorified her greatest son
during his life...

740
01:13:32,357 --> 01:13:35,019
...and magnified his name after his death.

741
01:13:35,427 --> 01:13:39,022
Indeed, what would this city be...

742
01:13:39,197 --> 01:13:40,926
...as the mayor said...

743
01:13:41,099 --> 01:13:45,536
...but a sad bundle of stones
without his art to spark its citizens.

744
01:13:45,804 --> 01:13:49,865
As we who teach art know...

745
01:13:52,510 --> 01:13:54,910
...technique can be acquired...

746
01:13:55,713 --> 01:13:58,409
...but real, true talent...

747
01:13:59,017 --> 01:14:00,416
...is a gift...

748
01:14:03,321 --> 01:14:05,221
...only from God.

749
01:14:07,125 --> 01:14:10,458
This year my vote went to the most
talented boy...

750
01:14:10,628 --> 01:14:12,425
...I've ever come across.

751
01:14:12,597 --> 01:14:15,657
His dynamic painting exhibited vision...

752
01:14:15,934 --> 01:14:18,994
...and a comprehension
way beyond his years.

753
01:14:19,170 --> 01:14:21,104
He means me.

754
01:14:21,706 --> 01:14:24,402
But I am just a single vote, and this boy...

755
01:14:24,576 --> 01:14:26,510
Yes, well, it is getting late...

756
01:14:26,678 --> 01:14:29,909
...and I believe that what Master La Grande
means to say...

757
01:14:30,315 --> 01:14:32,249
...is...

758
01:14:33,618 --> 01:14:35,916
...that the winner...

759
01:14:36,888 --> 01:14:41,257
...is a young artist whose potential
is immense.

760
01:14:41,759 --> 01:14:45,195
Master Robert Kessler.

761
01:14:53,171 --> 01:14:54,661
Good work!

762
01:15:00,178 --> 01:15:02,203
It's over, Patrasche.

763
01:15:03,648 --> 01:15:05,115
It's over.

764
01:15:06,885 --> 01:15:08,477
It's all over.

765
01:15:44,155 --> 01:15:46,282
We've got nowhere to go.

766
01:15:47,425 --> 01:15:49,791
No one wants us anymore.

767
01:15:53,765 --> 01:15:56,233
Come on. It's cold.

768
01:15:56,568 --> 01:15:59,696
What is it, Patrasche? What is it?

769
01:16:08,479 --> 01:16:10,379
It's a wallet.

770
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:17,915
Look at all this money.

771
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:31,728
Come in, you poor dears.

772
01:16:33,638 --> 01:16:36,072
Something terrible has happened.

773
01:16:36,374 --> 01:16:39,104
Millie, make up a big bag of food for them.

774
01:16:40,111 --> 01:16:41,669
Is Master Cogez here?

775
01:16:41,846 --> 01:16:44,838
- No, he's out looking for the...
- This?

776
01:16:45,550 --> 01:16:48,280
Dear God, Nello! You found it.

777
01:16:48,453 --> 01:16:49,977
It was Patrasche.

778
01:16:50,154 --> 01:16:54,420
It's a Christmas miracle! Thank you.
Thank you, Patrasche.

779
01:16:56,127 --> 01:16:58,254
Look. Isn't it wonderful?

780
01:16:58,429 --> 01:17:03,492
We won't need that food. We'll eat together,
and you can give the wallet yourself.

781
01:17:03,668 --> 01:17:05,761
- Dinner is almost ready.
- Okay.

782
01:17:06,004 --> 01:17:08,529
Come on, Nello. There's butter cookies.

783
01:17:09,307 --> 01:17:11,707
Can you please give Patrasche
some warm milk?

784
01:17:11,909 --> 01:17:14,400
Come on, Patrasche. Come on.

785
01:17:14,579 --> 01:17:16,274
Good boy.

786
01:17:19,183 --> 01:17:20,514
Madame...

787
01:17:21,085 --> 01:17:24,953
...please tell Master Cogez it was Patrasche
who found the money.

788
01:17:25,123 --> 01:17:28,388
He won't deny an old dog a roof
over his head, will he?

789
01:17:29,861 --> 01:17:32,591
Nicholas will be back very soon...

790
01:17:32,764 --> 01:17:35,790
...and you and I will tell him together.

791
01:17:36,501 --> 01:17:38,867
You know what? I have something for you.

792
01:17:39,037 --> 01:17:42,734
Sit by the fire. I'll be back in a moment.

793
01:18:09,701 --> 01:18:12,693
- Where did Nello go?
- I don't know.

794
01:18:13,471 --> 01:18:14,802
Maybe he went home.

795
01:18:21,779 --> 01:18:23,838
It's Nicholas. He's home.

796
01:18:26,084 --> 01:18:29,110
We're ruined. Everything's gone.
All those years of work.

797
01:18:29,287 --> 01:18:31,187
- Listen!
- I've looked everywhere...

798
01:18:31,355 --> 01:18:32,549
...and I can't find it.

799
01:18:34,759 --> 01:18:38,889
What is that damn dog doing here?
I want him out.

800
01:18:39,063 --> 01:18:41,088
Here! Here's your money. Take it.

801
01:18:43,634 --> 01:18:48,367
Nello may never amount to much.
But you're lucky he's such an honest boy.

802
01:18:48,539 --> 01:18:51,508
And that "damn dog" found it for you.

803
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:55,802
And don't worry.
There's not one franc missing.

804
01:19:45,329 --> 01:19:46,455
Sir?

805
01:19:54,806 --> 01:19:56,171
Madam?

806
01:20:01,479 --> 01:20:04,107
You should eat something, Aloise.

807
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:17,985
There's something I must tell you, sir.

808
01:20:19,630 --> 01:20:23,498
Master Stephens told me that if I told you,
I'd lose my job.

809
01:20:25,503 --> 01:20:27,471
I like the job.

810
01:20:28,372 --> 01:20:30,101
I like your family.

811
01:20:35,146 --> 01:20:36,613
I don't care.

812
01:20:37,548 --> 01:20:40,381
When I think about Nello outside alone...

813
01:20:40,852 --> 01:20:43,286
What are you talking about, Millie?

814
01:20:43,888 --> 01:20:45,685
He didn't do it, sir.

815
01:20:47,992 --> 01:20:50,085
Nello didn't cause the fire.

816
01:20:50,261 --> 01:20:51,660
How would you know?

817
01:20:52,463 --> 01:20:54,556
Because I was there, sir.

818
01:20:56,734 --> 01:20:59,066
It was Master Stephens, sir.

819
01:21:02,773 --> 01:21:06,106
<i>It was an accident,
but he did it all the same.</i>

820
01:21:13,818 --> 01:21:15,683
<i>He was drunk.</i>

821
01:21:19,924 --> 01:21:21,152
He...

822
01:21:21,926 --> 01:21:23,621
He...

823
01:21:25,029 --> 01:21:27,998
He lit up his pipe in the shed.

824
01:21:28,332 --> 01:21:29,959
I'm sorry.

825
01:21:34,171 --> 01:21:36,105
Nicholas, what are you going to do?

826
01:21:36,540 --> 01:21:38,474
I'm going to find Nello.

827
01:21:39,844 --> 01:21:42,335
I've done that boy a terrible wrong, Anna.

828
01:22:20,885 --> 01:22:24,116
- Nello, where are you?
- Answer me, boy!

829
01:23:24,015 --> 01:23:25,277
Find him!

830
01:23:36,627 --> 01:23:38,595
What are you doing here?

831
01:24:17,501 --> 01:24:20,493
This has been the coldest Christmas ever.

832
01:24:20,671 --> 01:24:25,199
But it hasn't chilled the hearts of our
parishioners. The Lord has been bountiful.

833
01:24:48,632 --> 01:24:50,896
Are you ready, Patrasche?

834
01:25:10,721 --> 01:25:14,589
Oh, Patrasche, not enough light.

835
01:25:14,758 --> 01:25:16,385
I can't see it.

836
01:25:31,509 --> 01:25:36,105
It's even colder in here than it is outside.

837
01:25:37,748 --> 01:25:39,841
Must be the stones.

838
01:25:43,921 --> 01:25:47,721
It isn't long till the sun rises, Patrasche.

839
01:25:49,860 --> 01:25:52,590
Once we see his masterpiece...

840
01:25:53,898 --> 01:25:56,264
...we can join Mother...

841
01:25:56,433 --> 01:25:58,401
...and Grandfather.

842
01:25:59,203 --> 01:26:02,263
The only people who still love us.

843
01:26:37,141 --> 01:26:38,904
Look.

844
01:26:43,047 --> 01:26:46,983
That's it. I'm sure Nello
went to see the Rubens.

845
01:27:19,183 --> 01:27:20,650
Look.

846
01:27:31,428 --> 01:27:33,487
Master Rubens?

847
01:27:34,098 --> 01:27:37,625
So, what do you think?

848
01:27:40,504 --> 01:27:41,937
It's...

849
01:27:42,373 --> 01:27:43,965
It's magnificent.

850
01:27:44,141 --> 01:27:46,666
I quite liked your circus painting too.

851
01:27:46,844 --> 01:27:48,539
You saw my painting?

852
01:27:48,712 --> 01:27:53,240
I've taken a strong interest
in your artistic career, Nello.

853
01:27:53,717 --> 01:27:55,116
But...

854
01:27:55,286 --> 01:27:57,311
...why didn't I win the art contest?

855
01:27:57,821 --> 01:28:01,484
You didn't want to just win, did you?

856
01:28:02,426 --> 01:28:05,623
No. And I can't blame you.

857
01:28:07,665 --> 01:28:10,600
You want to be accepted.

858
01:28:10,768 --> 01:28:13,896
To feel loved.

859
01:28:14,071 --> 01:28:16,904
What you want, all men seek.

860
01:28:17,374 --> 01:28:21,435
In 200 years from now, when people
will admire our paintings...

861
01:28:21,612 --> 01:28:25,104
...you really think anyone will remember
that silly contest?

862
01:28:26,317 --> 01:28:28,182
Will I be a great artist?

863
01:28:28,352 --> 01:28:31,844
People will be inspired by you
for years to come.

864
01:28:36,894 --> 01:28:38,794
I know how you feel.

865
01:28:38,962 --> 01:28:41,123
I left home once...

866
01:28:41,298 --> 01:28:43,289
...went to Italy for eight years.

867
01:28:44,201 --> 01:28:46,431
Then my mother got sick.

868
01:28:47,137 --> 01:28:50,231
By the time I came back here,
she was dead.

869
01:28:50,641 --> 01:28:52,802
My mother's dead too.

870
01:28:53,310 --> 01:28:54,902
You were her hero.

871
01:28:55,946 --> 01:28:59,814
Mary Daas. She's a very fine artist.

872
01:28:59,983 --> 01:29:02,713
- You knew my mother?
- Of course.

873
01:29:02,886 --> 01:29:06,822
Why do you think I've taken
such a strong interest in you?

874
01:29:07,157 --> 01:29:10,786
- Master?
- Yes?

875
01:29:10,994 --> 01:29:14,862
If it's all right, Patrasche and I
would like to come with you.

876
01:29:17,534 --> 01:29:19,297
No one cares.

877
01:29:19,636 --> 01:29:22,298
Do you really think you're not loved?

878
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:28,441
Then you've yet to learn to see
like a true artist:

879
01:29:28,779 --> 01:29:30,474
With your heart.

880
01:30:06,617 --> 01:30:08,949
My son.

881
01:30:14,091 --> 01:30:16,025
My son.

882
01:30:16,827 --> 01:30:19,625
My beautiful son.

883
01:30:29,006 --> 01:30:30,735
"The Lord is my shepherd.

884
01:30:30,941 --> 01:30:32,932
I shall not be in want.

885
01:30:33,343 --> 01:30:35,868
He makes me lie down in green pastures.

886
01:30:36,280 --> 01:30:39,181
He leads me beside quiet waters.

887
01:30:39,383 --> 01:30:41,613
He restores my soul.

888
01:30:43,454 --> 01:30:47,447
He guides me in the paths of
righteousness for His name's sake.

889
01:30:48,625 --> 01:30:54,029
Even though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death... "

890
01:31:19,289 --> 01:31:22,087
I went to find the boy...

891
01:31:22,259 --> 01:31:24,454
...who truly deserved to win the contest...

892
01:31:24,628 --> 01:31:27,461
...but I was too late.

893
01:31:28,699 --> 01:31:31,566
We were all too late, sir.

894
01:31:31,969 --> 01:31:33,334
Are you his mother?

895
01:31:33,637 --> 01:31:35,832
His mother lies there.

896
01:31:36,573 --> 01:31:39,565
And his grandfather lies there.

897
01:31:39,943 --> 01:31:42,571
The boy had no other family.

898
01:31:42,913 --> 01:31:44,505
Where is his father?

899
01:31:44,681 --> 01:31:49,914
Most people believe that Nello's father
lived in another city...

900
01:31:50,087 --> 01:31:52,920
...and that he died after Nello was born.

901
01:31:53,090 --> 01:31:54,785
And what do you believe, madam?

902
01:31:54,958 --> 01:31:57,950
I believe what his mother confided in me.

903
01:31:59,096 --> 01:32:01,656
That she had been in love...

904
01:32:01,832 --> 01:32:05,632
...with a prominent artist from this city.

905
01:32:11,375 --> 01:32:13,775
I want to live my life.

906
01:32:14,978 --> 01:32:19,074
But I don't want to leave you,
Grandfather, or you, Mama.

907
01:32:19,249 --> 01:32:21,444
Sweetheart.

908
01:32:22,319 --> 01:32:25,015
<i>You are loved, my son.</i>

909
01:32:25,188 --> 01:32:28,453
<i>I'll always be here waiting for you.</i>

910
01:32:34,598 --> 01:32:37,260
Nello, we're coming for you!

911
01:32:50,180 --> 01:32:53,775
Oh, no, Papa! Is he dead?

912
01:33:03,927 --> 01:33:08,387
- Nello, I thought you were dead.
- Aloise!

913
01:33:08,565 --> 01:33:10,624
I saw my own funeral.

914
01:33:12,736 --> 01:33:14,533
All of you were there.

915
01:33:14,738 --> 01:33:17,206
Just like I see you now.

916
01:33:17,975 --> 01:33:19,772
Rubens was with me...

917
01:33:19,943 --> 01:33:23,606
...my mother and Grandfather.

918
01:33:25,749 --> 01:33:28,980
Forgive me, Nello, I'm sorry.
Forgive me, forgive me.

919
01:33:47,504 --> 01:33:49,301
I have something.

920
01:33:51,975 --> 01:33:55,069
This was given to me when I was your age.

921
01:34:01,418 --> 01:34:03,283
I knew you'd come.

922
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:05,911
Just like in my dream.

923
01:34:07,591 --> 01:34:09,752
Did you know you taught my mother
to paint?

924
01:34:12,229 --> 01:34:13,958
Your mother?

925
01:34:14,498 --> 01:34:18,127
Mary Daas, your gifted student.

926
01:34:20,170 --> 01:34:22,001
Mary...

927
01:34:29,179 --> 01:34:31,647
Mary never told us...

928
01:34:31,815 --> 01:34:34,079
...who you were.

929
01:34:35,285 --> 01:34:39,085
She was afraid of the disgrace
that it would bring, and...

930
01:34:40,657 --> 01:34:43,854
...she was afraid that the scandal
would ruin you.

931
01:34:49,132 --> 01:34:51,430
She loved you so much.

932
01:34:52,169 --> 01:34:53,864
My son.

933
01:34:54,538 --> 01:34:56,301
My son.

934
01:34:56,473 --> 01:34:58,134
Father.

935
01:34:58,909 --> 01:35:00,638
Dear God, thank you.

936
