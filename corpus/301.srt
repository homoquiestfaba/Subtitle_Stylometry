00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,950
ARKANGEL CHEMICAL WEAPONS FACILITY - USSR

2
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,010
Beg your pardon. Forgot to knock.

3
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,030
I'm alone.

4
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,470
Aren't we all ?

5
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,200
You're late, 007.

6
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,490
I had to stop in the bathroom.

7
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:01,890
Ready to save the world again ?

8
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,010
After you, 006.

9
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:12,120
James... For England.

10
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,240
For England, Alec.

11
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,230
It's too easy.

12
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:01,330
Half of everything is luck, James.

13
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:05,030
And the other half ?

14
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,120
Fate.

15
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,130
- Set timers: six minutes.
- Six minutes. Check.

16
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,050
Fire.

17
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:47,260
- Closing time, James. Last call.
- Buy me a pint.

18
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:07,820
This is Colonel Ourumov.
Come out with your hands up.

19
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,570
How original.

20
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:16,360
Shut the door, Alec. There's a draft.

21
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,100
Alec ?

22
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:37,670
Move out. Throw down your weapon
and walk towards me, slowly.

23
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:41,580
- Finish the job, James. Blow them to hell.
- You have ten seconds.

24
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,420
Ten,

25
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,710
nine, eight,

26
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,840
seven, six,

27
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:55,590
five, four,

28
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,050
- three, two...
- For England, James.

29
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:04,260
Hold your fire.
You'll blow the gas tanks.

30
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:09,310
This is your last chance.
Come out with your hands...

31
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,230
Wait.

32
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,710
You can't win.

33
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:22,180
Get out there. Move. Move it.

34
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:38,310
Hold your fire.

35
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,830
Wait.

36
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,880
NINE YEARS LATER

37
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:37,630
- James, is it necessary to drive so fast ?
- More often than you'd think.

38
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,520
I enjoy a spirited ride
as much as the next girl, but...

39
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,270
- Who's that ?
- The next girl.

40
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,890
James, stop this. Stop it.

41
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:08,220
- I know what you're doing.
- What's that, dear ?

42
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:11,560
You are just trying to show off
the size of your...

43
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:13,810
- Engine ?
- Ego.

44
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,690
We're having a pleasant drive
and you bring psychology into it.

45
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:22,150
- I was just sent here to evaluate you.
- Let's put that behind us, shall we ?

46
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:00,670
Ladies first.

47
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,630
James, I want you to stop this car.

48
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,260
- Really ?
- Stop this car at once.

49
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:31,730
As you can see, I have no problem
with female authority.

50
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:41,020
James, you're incorrigible.

51
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:43,610
What am I going to do with you ?

52
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:47,480
Let's toast your evaluation, shall we ?

53
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,910
A very thorough evaluation.

54
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,380
Madame wins.

55
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:01,770
Bet, mademoiselle ? Non ?

56
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:06,570
Bets, ladies and gentlemen ?

57
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:10,190
- No players ?
- Banco.

58
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:27,200
It appears we share the same passions.

59
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:29,160
Three, anyway.

60
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:33,750
I count two - motoring and baccarat.

61
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,630
Seven. Madame wins.

62
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:46,550
I hope the third
is where your real talent lies.

63
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:49,550
One rises to meet a challenge.

64
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:28,900
Madame stands with five.

65
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:35,240
Six. Madame loses.

66
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:42,080
- Enjoy it while it lasts.
- The very words I live by.

67
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,700
And what words do you live by ?

68
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:55,870
- The trick is to quit while you're ahead.
- That's one trick I've never learned.

69
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,210
Perhaps you'll show me how it's done.

70
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:02,090
Vodka martini. Shaken, not stirred.

71
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,250
And for you ?

72
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,500
The same.

73
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:08,670
How do you take it ?

74
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:11,970
Straight up, with a twist.

75
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,590
Thank you, Mr...

76
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,760
The name's Bond. James Bond.

77
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:22,220
Xenia Sergueievna Onatopp.

78
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:26,470
- Onatopp ?
- Onatopp.

79
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:31,600
- Your accent... Georgian ?
- Very good, Mr Bond.

80
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:34,100
- You've been to Russia.
- Not recently.

81
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:37,900
I used to drop in occasionally.
Shoot in and out.

82
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:41,940
It's very different now.
A land of opportunity.

83
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,690
With a new Ferrari in every garage ?

84
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:48,940
No, not quite. That belongs to a friend.

85
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:54,990
A tip for your friend: the French number
plates for this year's model start with "L".

86
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:57,700
Even the counterfeit ones.

87
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:05,120
And what rank do you hold with
the motor vehicles department, Mr Bond ?

88
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:06,660
Commander.

89
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,830
Shall we go ?

90
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,160
This one is an admiral.

91
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:14,540
I like a woman who enjoys pulling rank.

92
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:18,250
Nice to meet you, Mr Bond.

93
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,380
The pleasure, I'm sure, was all mine.

94
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:50,920
Transmission begins from Moneypenny.

95
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:55,840
Identification confirmed.
Onatopp, Xenia. Ex-Soviet fighter pilot.

96
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:59,800
Current suspected links to the Janus
crime syndicate, St Petersburg.

97
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:03,600
Yacht "Manticore" is leased
to a known Janus corporate front.

98
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,100
M authorises you
to observe Miss Onatopp,

99
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:10,680
but stipulates no contact
without prior approval.

100
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:13,020
End of transmission. Moneypenny.

101
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:17,480
Good night, James. I trust
you'll stay "onatopp" of things.

102
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:03,250
Xenia, I can't breathe.

103
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:14,590
Yes ! Yes !

104
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,960
Merci, mon amiral. My respects, Admiral.

105
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,630
Delighted to have you aboard,
mademoiselle.

106
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,380
Ladies and gentlemen,

107
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:38,680
please take your seats
for the demonstration of the aircraft.

108
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,860
What you are about to see is Europe's
answer to the electronic battlefield:

109
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:20,580
the first working prototype
of the Tiger helicopter.

110
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:24,410
Uniquely manoeuvrable, the Tiger
not only uses Stealth technology,

111
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:28,700
it is hardened against all forms
of electronic interference,

112
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:31,410
radio jamming
and electromagnetic radiation.

113
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:44,750
I have a small surprise from
your friends at the barracks.

114
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,880
I think I've gone to heaven.

115
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:48,670
Not yet.

116
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:59,510
Please welcome the pilots.

117
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:06,850
Lieutenant Commander Bernard Jaubert
and Lieutenant François Brouse.

118
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:57,750
SPACE WEAPONS CONTROL CENTER
Severnaya, RUSSIA

119
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:16,510
Select Mir.

120
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,350
Orthographic projection.

121
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:25,310
Compute possible intercept
with second-stage geo-sat two.

122
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:34,350
Anna.

123
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:40,940
He wouldn't know a woman
if one came up and sat on his head.

124
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,980
Boris.

125
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,820
What ?

126
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,820
I thought I'd post it
on the lnternet, no ?

127
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:57,280
- What's the password ?
- What's the password?

128
00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:00,780
Even you should be able to break it,
borscht-for-brains.

129
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:05,330
All right. All right.
I'll give you a hint.

130
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:10,960
They're right in front of you
and can open very large doors.

131
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:17,290
- You're such a geek.
- Yes. I'm in.

132
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,380
You've hacked into
the US Department of Justice.

133
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:29,510
What if they trace it here ?

134
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:33,470
The chief of computers will call me
a genius, move me to Moscow

135
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:37,090
and give me a million bucks
hard currency.

136
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:40,180
I think not.

137
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:44,350
Besides, the Americans are slug-heads.
They'll never detect me.

138
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:48,350
You were saying, slug-head ?

139
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,310
Nobody screws with Boris Grishenko.

140
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,480
- Spiked them.
- Come on, Boris. Just hang up.

141
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:59,400
No way. I spiked them.

142
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:06,190
- All right. What's the password ?
- I'm not going to tell you.

143
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,150
OK. Let me guess.

144
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,820
It's not in front of me ?

145
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:15,320
You sit on it,
but you can't take it with you.

146
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,740
My program seizes the phone line
of whoever's tracing me

147
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:27,160
and jams their modem
so they can't hang up.

148
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:31,170
Now the hunted becomes the hunter.

149
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,710
"Better luck next time,

150
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:39,590
slug-heads."

151
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:44,050
Bang. Gone. I am invincible.

152
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,050
Was it good for you, too ?

153
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,720
I'm getting some coffee.

154
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:56,890
I'm going for a cigarette.

155
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:05,710
General Arkady Grigorovich Ourumov,
head of Space Division.

156
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,470
- General, if I'd known...
- You'd have been ready.

157
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:24,720
This is an unscheduled test
of Severnaya, Major. War simulation.

158
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:28,140
We are going to test-fire GoldenEye.
Report your status.

159
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:33,980
Two operational satellites, sir, Petya and
Mischa, in 90-minute earth orbit at 100km.

160
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:35,650
Good.

161
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:37,810
Here is the authorisation code.

162
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:42,940
Now, the GoldenEye and today's access
numbers for satellite Petya, please.

163
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:45,190
I am timing you.

164
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:18,840
Good. Thank you, Major.

165
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:58,230
On my count.

166
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,520
Three, two, one...

167
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:12,360
Set target. Severnaya.

168
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:25,950
Arm the weapon.

169
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,630
Check it.

170
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,480
Their best response time
is 19 minutes. They'll be late.

171
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,410
It's clean. I had to ventilate someone.

172
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:25,180
- Good evening, Moneypenny.
- Good evening, James.

173
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:28,480
M will meet you in the Situation Room.
I'm to take you in.

174
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,900
- Never seen you after hours. Lovely.
- Thank you, James.

175
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:35,810
Out on some kind of assignment ?
Dressing to kill ?

176
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:38,480
I know you'll find this crushing, 007,

177
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:42,320
but I don't sit at home
praying for an international incident

178
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,740
so I can run down here
all dressed up to impress James Bond.

179
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:49,490
I was on a date with a gentleman.
We went to the theatre.

180
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:51,990
Moneypenny, I'm devastated.

181
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,570
What would I ever do without you ?

182
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:58,830
As far as I can remember, James,
you've never had me.

183
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:04,160
Hope springs eternal.

184
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:07,960
This sort of behaviour
could qualify as sexual harassment.

185
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:11,500
Really ? What's the penalty for that ?

186
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:14,710
Someday you have to make good
on your innuendoes.

187
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:23,260
- After you, Moneypenny.
- No, I insist. You first.

188
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:31,180
- Good evening, 007.
- Tanner. What's up ?

189
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:34,050
16 minutes ago,
we intercepted a distress call

190
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:38,140
from a supposedly abandoned
radar station at Severnaya. Look.

191
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:47,770
- We found a match. Your missing Tiger.
- In the middle of northern Russia ?

192
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:52,190
Your hunch was right. Too bad the evil
queen of numbers wouldn't let you play it.

193
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,400
- You were saying ?
- No, no. I was just... just...

194
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:05,650
Good. Because if I want sarcasm, I'll
talk to my children, thank you very much.

195
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,400
- Good evening, 007.
- Good evening, M.

196
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:11,820
The prime minister's
waiting for an update.

197
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:14,950
Proceed with your briefing, Mr Tanner.

198
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,200
Thank you.

199
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:21,080
Yes, after the distress signal,
your helicopter took off

200
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,790
and the Russians
had three MiGs intercept it.

201
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:26,620
What do you think the base is used for ?

202
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:29,540
We suspected it might be
the ground station

203
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:33,330
for a secret space-based
weapon called GoldenEye, but...

204
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:38,380
Our statistical analysis saw they had
neither the finance nor technology.

205
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:41,380
Numbers were never my strong suit.

206
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:44,050
Are these pictures live ?

207
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:48,050
Unlike the American government, we
prefer not to get our bad news from CNN.

208
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,150
Negative so far.
Everything seems normal.

209
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,970
What the bloody hell was that ?

210
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:48,140
Natalya Fiodorovna Simonova.

211
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:09,190
Boris. Boris.

212
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,060
Thanks.

213
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:16,560
Our satellite is knocked out.
So are two of the Americans.

214
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:22,190
We have another, coming into range now.

215
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:27,900
Good God.

216
00:43:29,490 --> 00:43:31,490
Two of the MiGs are down.

217
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:33,950
It looks like the third went into the dish.

218
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:36,080
What do you think ?

219
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:40,990
No lights. Not one single
electric light on in a 30-mile radius.

220
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:45,330
- EMP ?
- It would explain the MiGs and satellites.

221
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:48,080
- And the blackout.
- Electromagnetic pulse.

222
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:53,250
- A satellite weapon developed by the...
- Americans and Soviets in the Cold War.

223
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:55,420
I've read the brief.

224
00:43:55,590 --> 00:44:00,170
Discovered after Hiroshima. Set off
a nuclear device in the upper atmosphere.

225
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:05,420
Creates a pulse, a radiation surge,
that destroys everything electronic.

226
00:44:05,590 --> 00:44:10,640
The idea being to knock out the enemy's
communications before they can retaliate.

227
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:14,260
So, GoldenEye exists.

228
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:17,060
Yes.

229
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:20,560
- Could this be an accident ?
- No. The helicopter.

230
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:24,100
For stealing the GoldenEye,
it was the perfect getaway vehicle.

231
00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:27,770
Setting off the blast would
wipe out any trace of the crime.

232
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:32,230
- The Janus group ?
- It may be linked to the helicopter.

233
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:35,270
I know the Russian fail-safe systems.

234
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:40,570
You just don't walk in and ask for the keys
to the bomb. You need the access codes.

235
00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:49,950
There had to be an insider.

236
00:44:57,870 --> 00:45:00,370
At least one person
probably knows who it is.

237
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:25,720
Very well, sir. Thank you. Good night.

238
00:45:27,470 --> 00:45:32,340
The prime minister's talked to Moscow. It
was "an accident on a training exercise".

239
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:35,600
Governments change.
The lies stay the same.

240
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,680
What else do we know about Janus ?

241
00:45:37,850 --> 00:45:41,180
Top-flight arms dealers,
headquartered in St Petersburg.

242
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:44,230
Restocked the lraqis during the Gulf War.

243
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:47,690
The head man's unreliably
described. No photographs.

244
00:45:47,850 --> 00:45:53,190
The woman, Onatopp,
is our only confirmed contact.

245
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:56,900
- Would you care for a drink?
- Thank you.

246
00:45:57,070 --> 00:46:00,610
- Your predecessor kept some cognac...
- I prefer bourbon.

247
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,740
- Ice ?
- Yes.

248
00:46:11,410 --> 00:46:16,490
We pulled the files on whoever may have
had access or authority at Severnaya.

249
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:20,620
The top name on the list's
an old friend of yours, I understand.

250
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:26,960
Ourumov. They made him a general.

251
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:30,040
He sees himself as the next
"iron man of Russia".

252
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:34,080
Our political analysts say
he doesn't fit the profile of a traitor.

253
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:38,170
Are these the same analysts who said
that GoldenEye couldn't exist?

254
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:43,260
Who said the helicopter posed no threat
and wasn't worth following ?

255
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:47,550
You don't like me, Bond.
You don't like my methods.

256
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:52,550
You think I'm an accountant, more
interested in numbers than your instincts.

257
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,010
- The thought had occurred to me.
- Good.

258
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:58,390
Because I think you're
a sexist, misogynist dinosaur,

259
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:02,390
a relic of the Cold War, whose
boyish charms, though wasted on me,

260
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:06,180
obviously appealed to that young woman
I sent out to evaluate you.

261
00:47:06,350 --> 00:47:09,390
- Point taken.
- Not quite, 007.

262
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:13,310
If you think I don't have the balls
to send a man out to die,

263
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:15,820
your instincts are dead wrong.

264
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:18,860
I've no compunction
about sending you to your death.

265
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:24,700
But I won't do it on a whim, even
with your cavalier attitude towards life.

266
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,200
I want you to find GoldenEye.

267
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:32,660
Find who took it, what they plan
to do with it, and stop it.

268
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:35,280
If you come across Ourumov,
guilty or not,

269
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:40,620
don't run off on a vendetta. Avenging
Alec Trevelyan will not bring him back.

270
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:45,410
- You didn't get him killed.
- Neither did you. Don't make it personal.

271
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:48,250
Never.

272
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,880
Bond...

273
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:58,460
Come back alive.

274
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:05,760
SAINT-PETERSBOURG, RUSSIA

275
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,240
Good morning, General Ourumov.

276
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:45,780
Defence Minister Mishkin... Gentlemen.

277
00:48:45,950 --> 00:48:48,610
Please, deliver your report.

278
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:56,660
As you know, 72 hours ago, a secret
weapons system - codename GoldenEye -

279
00:48:56,830 --> 00:48:58,830
was detonated over Severnaya.

280
00:48:58,990 --> 00:49:03,500
As head of Space Division,
I personally undertook the investigation.

281
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:08,170
I have concluded this crime was
committed by Siberian separatists

282
00:49:08,330 --> 00:49:10,880
seeking to create political unrest.

283
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:16,250
Regrettably, the peaceful work and the
hard-currency earnings of Severnaya

284
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:19,300
have been set back by several years.

285
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:21,460
Therefore, I tender my resignation.

286
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:28,260
It seems the council does not want
your head, Arkady Grigorovich.

287
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:31,640
Merely your assurance that
there are no other GoldenEyes.

288
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:34,510
I can give you that assurance,
Defence Minister.

289
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:38,060
And what of the two missing
Severnaya technicians ?

290
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:44,350
I was aware only of the one.
Boris Grishenko.

291
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:47,560
There was a girl also, whose body
was not among the dead.

292
00:49:47,730 --> 00:49:50,850
Natalya Fyodorovna Simonova.
A level-two programmer.

293
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:53,520
I will investigate immediately.

294
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:59,070
It would seem presumptuous to blame
this incident on Siberian separatists

295
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:03,610
before the whereabouts
of your own people are determined.

296
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:07,740
- Do you agree ?
- Yes, Defence Minister.

297
00:50:08,410 --> 00:50:11,530
Thank you for bringing it to my attention.

298
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:14,990
That will be all.

299
00:50:28,830 --> 00:50:32,210
Morning, Q. Sorry about the leg. Skiing ?

300
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,210
Hunting.

301
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:39,800
Right. Now pay attention, 007.

302
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,970
Right. Now pay attention, 007.

303
00:50:42,130 --> 00:50:46,300
BMW. Agile, five forward gears,
all-points radar.

304
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:52,350
Self-destruct system. And, naturally,
all the usual refinements.

305
00:50:52,510 --> 00:50:56,060
Now, this I'm particularly proud of.

306
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:59,060
Behind the headlights, Stinger missiles.

307
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:02,680
Excellent. Just the thing
for unwinding after a rough day.

308
00:51:02,850 --> 00:51:09,730
Need I remind you, 007, that you have
a licence to kill, not break the traffic laws.

309
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:12,610
- I wouldn't think of it.
- Good.

310
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:15,820
Right. Let's get on
to more practical matters.

311
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:21,650
A typical leather belt.
Male, size 34, buckle, notch.

312
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,240
Have you finished ?

313
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:27,780
- Yes.
- Good.

314
00:51:27,950 --> 00:51:30,820
- A typical belt...
- Q, I'm familiar with that device.

315
00:51:30,990 --> 00:51:35,370
Not one with a 75-foot
rappelling cord built into the buckle.

316
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:38,540
Fire, and out shoots a piton,

317
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:42,540
followed by a high-tensile wire
designed to support your weight.

318
00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:46,000
I see. And what if I need
additional support ?

319
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:48,420
It's tested for one, 007.

320
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:56,500
Flight 878 to St Petersburg.

321
00:51:58,340 --> 00:52:01,010
X-ray document scanner.

322
00:52:01,130 --> 00:52:04,340
A pen. This is a class 4 grenade.

323
00:52:04,510 --> 00:52:07,970
A pen. This is a class 4 grenade.

324
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:11,010
Another three disarms it.

325
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:16,390
How long did you say the fuse was ?

326
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:18,520
Grow up, 007.

327
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:23,230
- "The pen is mightier than the sword."
- Thanks to me, it is.

328
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:27,400
Look, let's ask Freddie here
to demonstrate for us.

329
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:31,900
Here we are. Sorry about this, Fred.
One, two, three.

330
00:52:38,150 --> 00:52:41,240
- Don't say it.
- The writing's on the wall ?

331
00:52:42,110 --> 00:52:44,450
Along with the rest of him.

332
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,030
Now, 007, do please try and return...

333
00:52:51,570 --> 00:52:54,950
Do try and return some of this
equipment in pristine order.

334
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:58,330
Don't touch that. That's my lunch.

335
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:26,180
In London, April's a spring month.

336
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:29,090
Oh, yeah ? What are you the weatherman ?

337
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:32,300
For cryin' out loud.
Another stiff-assed Brit,

338
00:53:32,470 --> 00:53:34,760
with your secret codes and passwords.

339
00:53:34,930 --> 00:53:38,100
One of these days you guys
are gonna learn just to drop it.

340
00:53:38,270 --> 00:53:40,850
Come on. My car's over there.

341
00:53:55,530 --> 00:53:58,110
- After you.
- Thank you.

342
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:02,700
- Like you said, drop it.
- All right.

343
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:06,990
In London, April's a spring month.
In St Petersburg, we freeze our butts off.

344
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,950
- Close enough for government work ?
- No.

345
00:54:11,070 --> 00:54:14,160
- Show me the rose.
- Please, no.

346
00:54:14,330 --> 00:54:16,700
All right, all right, all right.

347
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:31,920
- "Muffy" ?
- Third wife.

348
00:54:32,090 --> 00:54:35,750
- Jack Wade, CIA.
- James Bond, stiff-assed Brit.

349
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,920
- That's a nice move.
- Nice car.

350
00:54:38,090 --> 00:54:42,050
Hasn't let me down yet. She's an ugly
little bitch, but she gets you there.

351
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:44,880
Hey, Bond. Do you do any gardening ?

352
00:54:50,090 --> 00:54:55,600
St Petersburg express
has now arrived at Platform 3.

353
00:55:01,770 --> 00:55:03,770
Can you hand me that wrench, Jimmy ?

354
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:08,060
- So what do you know about Janus ?
- Zilch. Zipsky.

355
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:11,770
No one's ever seen him.
But the man's connected up the kazoo.

356
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:14,360
KGB, military... Screwdriver.

357
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:20,570
Rumour has it he lives on
one of those old Soviet missile trains.

358
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:24,780
That armoured stuff they used to
run around so we couldn't target 'em.

359
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,240
Wanna hand me that hammer, Jimbo ?

360
00:55:28,410 --> 00:55:30,780
No, the bigger one. The sledge.

361
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:35,200
Anyways, to tell the truth,
you don't find this guy. He finds you.

362
00:55:35,370 --> 00:55:38,160
Hell, it's all Russian Mafia.

363
00:55:38,330 --> 00:55:42,870
Best thing I can do is point you
in the direction of his competition.

364
00:55:46,370 --> 00:55:49,830
- Who is the competition ?
- An ex-KGB guy. Tough mother.

365
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,590
Limps on his right leg. Name's Zukovsky.

366
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:55,170
- Valentin Dimitreveych Zukovsky?
- Yeah.

367
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:58,210
- You know him ?
- I gave him the limp.

368
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:25,020
Yes ?

369
00:56:25,190 --> 00:56:29,360
- Are these all you have ?
- How many do you want ?

370
00:56:30,650 --> 00:56:33,480
24 for the American school,
11 for the Swedish.

371
00:56:33,650 --> 00:56:38,990
IBM-compatible with 500 meg
hard drives, CD-ROM and 14.4 modems.

372
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:42,280
- You pay dollars ?
- Of course.

373
00:56:42,450 --> 00:56:44,530
If madam requires a demonstration...

374
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:49,570
Madam requires one demonstration
model and a quiet place to test it.

375
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:04,670
Natalya.

376
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:25,930
- Is everything satisfactory ?
- Everything except the interruption.

377
00:57:37,970 --> 00:57:40,180
Let me get this straight, Jimmy.

378
00:57:40,350 --> 00:57:44,100
You shot him in the leg,
you stole his car, you took his girl.

379
00:57:44,270 --> 00:57:47,270
And now you want Zukovsky
to set you up with Janus ?

380
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:50,900
- Yes.
- Are you gonna appeal to his heart ?

381
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:54,110
- No. His wallet.
- That might work.

382
00:57:55,150 --> 00:57:56,650
OK. Showtime.

383
00:58:02,070 --> 00:58:04,860
Valentin operates
out of building number 23.

384
00:58:05,030 --> 00:58:07,030
Are you sure you wanna do this ?

385
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:12,530
Last guy who dropped in uninvited went
home air freight - in very small boxes.

386
00:58:13,450 --> 00:58:16,490
Make sure they send me home first class.

387
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:14,980
Natalya. It's me. It's Boris.
It's Boris. It's Boris. Hello.

388
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:23,150
Another morning shot to hell.

389
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:29,070
Free-market economy !
I swear it will be the end of me.

390
00:59:33,490 --> 00:59:36,830
Walther PPK, 7.65mm.

391
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:42,120
Only three men I know use such a gun.
I believe I've killed two of them.

392
00:59:42,290 --> 00:59:46,080
- Lucky me.
- I think not.

393
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,680
James Bond.

394
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:17,310
Charming, sophisticated secret agent.

395
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:21,230
"Shaken, but not stirred."

396
01:00:22,350 --> 01:00:26,230
I see you haven't lost your
delicate sense of humour, Valentin.

397
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:28,690
Or your need for an audience.

398
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:33,610
- Who's strangling the cat ?
- Strangling a cat ?

399
01:00:39,490 --> 01:00:42,530
That is Irina, my mistress.

400
01:00:44,110 --> 01:00:46,530
Very talented girl.

401
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:48,990
Irina. Take a hike.

402
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:58,830
So, Mr Bond, what is it that
brings you to my neighbour hood ?

403
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:04,620
Still working for MI6, or
have you joined the 21st century ?

404
01:01:04,790 --> 01:01:07,000
I hear the new M is a lady.

405
01:01:07,170 --> 01:01:10,130
I want you to do me a favour.

406
01:01:11,630 --> 01:01:15,380
He wants me to do him a favour.

407
01:01:16,170 --> 01:01:22,470
My knee aches every single day.
Twice as bad when it is cold.

408
01:01:22,630 --> 01:01:26,180
Have you any idea how long
the winter lasts in this country ?

409
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:28,760
- Tell him, Dimitri.
- It depends...

410
01:01:28,930 --> 01:01:30,510
Silence.

411
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:34,060
For an ex-KGB agent,
you surprise me, Valentin.

412
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:38,930
Surely you must have realised the skill
was not to hit your knee, but to

413
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:41,310
miss the rest of you.

414
01:01:42,390 --> 01:01:47,060
- So why did you not kill me ?
- Call it professional courtesy.

415
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:51,650
Then I should extend you
the same courtesy.

416
01:01:54,190 --> 01:01:58,240
Kirov's funeral parlour,
four o'clock this afternoon.

417
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:01,570
200 pounds of C4 explosives
hidden in a casket.

418
01:02:01,740 --> 01:02:05,110
Your man drives the hearse in,
the money's exchanged,

419
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:07,820
their man drives the hearse out.

420
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:10,660
Their man will be arrested
with the explosives.

421
01:02:10,780 --> 01:02:14,620
Your man will make
a miraculous escape with the money.

422
01:02:14,790 --> 01:02:16,830
Your man will make
a miraculous escape with the money.

423
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,710
And what do I owe
for this accommodation ?

424
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:23,080
I want you to set me up with Janus.

425
01:02:23,830 --> 01:02:28,250
- What has he done to deserve you?
- Stole a helicopter.

426
01:02:28,420 --> 01:02:31,670
- I have six.
- Three. None that fly.

427
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:35,750
- Who's counting ?
- These aren't just criminals but traitors.

428
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:40,920
They used the chopper to steal a nuclear
weapon. Killed a lot of innocent Russians.

429
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:43,760
- What do you expect from a Cossack ?
- Who ?

430
01:02:44,930 --> 01:02:48,640
This Janus - I never met the man,
but I know he's a Lienz Cossack.

431
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:51,810
The group that worked
for the Nazis, Second World War.

432
01:02:51,970 --> 01:02:54,640
You know your history.
At the end of the war,

433
01:02:54,810 --> 01:02:58,310
the Lienz Cossacks surrendered
to the British in Austria,

434
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:02,850
believing they would join them
and wage war against the communists.

435
01:03:03,020 --> 01:03:06,310
But the British betrayed them,
sent them back to Stalin,

436
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:08,480
who promptly had them all shot.

437
01:03:08,650 --> 01:03:11,150
Women, children, families.

438
01:03:12,820 --> 01:03:15,690
Not exactly our finest hour.

439
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:19,650
Still, ruthless people.
They got what they deserved.

440
01:03:19,820 --> 01:03:23,820
I want you to set me up with Janus.
Tell him I'm asking about the chopper.

441
01:03:23,990 --> 01:03:28,240
- You meet me tonight at the Grand Hotel.
- And then you and I are even and

442
01:03:28,410 --> 01:03:31,700
- he owes me one.
- Precisely.

443
01:04:34,190 --> 01:04:36,610
You don't need the gun, Commander.

444
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:40,650
That depends on
your definition of safe sex.

445
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:47,910
That's close enough.

446
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:50,530
Not for what I have in mind.

447
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:17,130
You think you can hurt me ?

448
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:38,600
You think you can break me

449
01:05:47,190 --> 01:05:49,520
Yes. Yes. Yes.

450
01:05:56,110 --> 01:05:58,990
No, no, no.

451
01:05:59,530 --> 01:06:01,530
No more foreplay.

452
01:06:04,030 --> 01:06:05,390
Take me to Janus.

453
01:06:21,580 --> 01:06:23,460
- This is it?
- Yes.

454
01:06:25,810 --> 01:06:29,300
Well, I must say, I've had a lovely evening.

455
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:30,640
You ?

456
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:32,660
Once again, the pleasure was all yours.

457
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:37,720
- You'll understand if I don't call.
- I won't lose sleep over it.

458
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:41,990
Sweet dreams.

459
01:07:54,130 --> 01:07:55,230
Hello, James.

460
01:08:18,770 --> 01:08:21,150
- Alec ?
- Back from the dead.

461
01:08:22,310 --> 01:08:26,730
No longer just an anonymous star
on the Memorial Wall at MI6.

462
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
What's the matter, James ?

463
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:32,160
No glib remark ? No pithy comeback ?

464
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:34,320
Why ?

465
01:08:36,390 --> 01:08:39,530
Hilarious question. Particularly from you.

466
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:45,130
Did you ever ask why we toppled
all those dictators and regimes,

467
01:08:45,790 --> 01:08:49,070
only to come home - "Well done.
Good job, but sorry, old boy".

468
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:52,700
"Everything you risked
your life for has changed".

469
01:08:53,370 --> 01:08:56,460
- It was the job we were chosen for.
- Of course you'd say that.

470
01:08:57,460 --> 01:09:02,600
James Bond, Her Majesty's loyal terrier,
defender of the so-called faith.

471
01:09:03,370 --> 01:09:05,800
Please, James, put it away.

472
01:09:06,550 --> 01:09:09,460
It's insulting to think
I haven't anticipated your every move.

473
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:13,970
Yes.

474
01:09:16,510 --> 01:09:21,220
- I trusted you, Alec.
- Trust. What a quaint idea.

475
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:26,260
How did the Ml6 screening miss
that your parents were Lienz Cossacks ?

476
01:09:26,930 --> 01:09:29,710
Once again, your faith
is misplaced. They knew.

477
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:31,690
We're both orphans, James.

478
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:36,810
But where your parents had the luxury
of dying in a climbing accident,

479
01:09:37,180 --> 01:09:41,060
mine survived the British betrayal

1
01:09:39,450 --> 01:09:41,220
and Stalin's execution squads.

2
01:09:42,190 --> 01:09:46,230
But my father couldn't let himself
or my mother live with the shame of it.

3
01:09:47,490 --> 01:09:50,450
MI6 figured I was too young to remember.

4
01:09:51,170 --> 01:09:53,310
And in one of life's little ironies,

5
01:09:53,980 --> 01:09:56,890
the son went to work for
the government whose betrayal

6
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:00,770
caused the father to kill
himself and his wife.

7
01:10:01,180 --> 01:10:06,280
Hence Janus, the two-faced
Roman god, come to life.

8
01:10:06,370 --> 01:10:08,490
It wasn't God who gave me this face.

9
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:12,730
It was you, setting the timers
for three minutes instead of six.

10
01:10:13,030 --> 01:10:18,960
- Am I supposed to feel sorry for you?
- No. You're supposed to die for me.

11
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:22,590
By the way,

12
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:28,150
I did think of asking you to join
my little scheme, but somehow I knew

13
01:10:29,070 --> 01:10:34,180
007's loyalty was always to the mission,
never to his friend.

14
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:38,400
Closing time, James. Last call.

15
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:55,770
For England, James.

16
01:10:56,070 --> 01:10:57,360
Wake up. Mister.

17
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:04,220
Wake up, please. Wake up.

18
01:11:04,270 --> 01:11:06,480
I'm heard. I'm heard.

19
01:11:06,970 --> 01:11:08,830
Hurry. Hurry up. Come on.

20
01:11:11,030 --> 01:11:12,390
Pull yourself together or we're gonna die.

21
01:11:15,950 --> 01:11:19,410
- Do something. Get us out of here.
- I'm a little tied up.

22
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:21,420
Never mind.

23
01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:43,450
The things we do
for frequent-flier mileage.

24
01:12:45,220 --> 01:12:47,020
Here. Let me help you.

25
01:12:47,490 --> 01:12:50,030
That's it. Mind your head.

26
01:12:57,970 --> 01:12:59,150
Let me go.

27
01:13:43,540 --> 01:13:44,430
Who are you ?

28
01:13:47,730 --> 01:13:51,270
- Listen. I'm on your side.
- I don't know anything.

29
01:13:51,450 --> 01:13:53,440
- I don't believe you.
- I don't care.

30
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:55,110
Look, they might be back any minute.

31
01:13:55,180 --> 01:13:59,730
Are you with me, or your countrymen
who killed everyone at Severnaya ?

32
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:01,610
I've never been to Severnaya.

33
01:14:02,470 --> 01:14:04,960
Your watch has. Frozen
by the GoldenEye blast.

34
01:14:06,090 --> 01:14:09,960
And I'm willing to bet you're the one
who climbed up the dish to get out.

35
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:14,030
- Who are you ?
- I work for the British government.

36
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:16,620
The more you tell me,
the more I can help you.

37
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:21,270
- But I don't know anything.
- Then start with what you do know.

38
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:32,310
My name is Natalya Simonova.

39
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:36,590
I was a systems programmer
at Severnaya facility until...

40
01:14:38,250 --> 01:14:39,450
Go on.

41
01:14:41,190 --> 01:14:44,300
- ...until they killed everyone.
- Who ? Alec Trevelyan ?

42
01:14:45,460 --> 01:14:49,180
- No. I don't know who that is.
- Who's the insider ? Who's the traitor ?

43
01:14:49,850 --> 01:14:51,460
Boris. Boris Grishenko.

44
01:14:52,230 --> 01:14:54,460
- KGB or military?
- Computer programmer.

45
01:14:56,030 --> 01:14:58,470
- There was no one else ?
- No.

46
01:15:00,970 --> 01:15:02,820
They're going to kill me, aren't they ?

47
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:07,200
Trust me.

48
01:15:08,310 --> 01:15:12,600
Trust you ? I don't even know your name.

49
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,960
Good morning, Mr Bond. Sit.

50
01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:26,440
I am Defence Minister Dimitri Mishkin.

51
01:15:27,610 --> 01:15:29,990
So, by what means shall we
execute you, Commander Bond ?

52
01:15:30,460 --> 01:15:32,540
What, no small talk ?

53
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:34,370
No chitchat ?

54
01:15:35,370 --> 01:15:39,080
That's the trouble. No one has time to do
a really sinister interrogation any more.

55
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:43,080
- It's a lost art.
- Your sense of humour doesn't slay me.

56
01:15:44,250 --> 01:15:46,750
- Where is the GoldenEye ?
- I assumed you had it.

57
01:15:47,310 --> 01:15:49,460
I have an English spy,
a programmer and a helicopter...

58
01:15:50,020 --> 01:15:53,130
- That's how your traitor wants it to look.
- Who attacked Severnaya ?

59
01:15:53,290 --> 01:15:56,920
- Who had the codes ?
- The penalty for terrorism is still death.

60
01:15:57,090 --> 01:16:01,250
- And for treason ?
- Stop it, both of you. Stop it.

61
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:03,840
You're like boys with toys.

62
01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:12,220
It was Ourumov.
General Ourumov set off the weapon.

63
01:16:12,590 --> 01:16:14,600
I saw him do it.

64
01:16:17,180 --> 01:16:19,510
- Are you certain it was Ourumov?
- Yes.

65
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:23,600
He killed everyone,
then stole the GoldenEye.

66
01:16:24,450 --> 01:16:27,240
And why would he do that ?

67
01:16:28,510 --> 01:16:30,310
There is another satellite.

68
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:35,650
Another GoldenEye.

69
01:16:37,690 --> 01:16:39,440
Thank you, Miss Simonova.

70
01:16:40,610 --> 01:16:42,980
What did you say about
the lost art of interrogation, Mr Bond ?

71
01:16:45,650 --> 01:16:48,820
Defence Minister, I must protest.
This is my investigation.

72
01:16:48,990 --> 01:16:51,070
You are out of order.

73
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:55,160
From what I am hearing,
it is you who is out of order.

74
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:57,620
I've seen this gun
in the hand of our enemy.

75
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:01,990
- Put it down, General.
- Do you even know who the enemy is ?

76
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:04,950
- Do you ?
- Guard.

77
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:14,740
Defence Minister Dimitri Mishkin,

78
01:17:15,090 --> 01:17:19,170
murdered by British agent James Bond,

79
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:24,500
himself shot while trying to escape.

80
01:17:25,470 --> 01:17:26,470
Guards.

81
01:17:38,650 --> 01:17:39,730
Come on.

82
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:21,490
They're in the archive.

83
01:18:26,370 --> 01:18:28,000
Down.

84
01:19:19,630 --> 01:19:21,450
Spread out. Cover the other side.

85
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:23,740
Trust me.

86
01:20:00,140 --> 01:20:01,140
Go now.

87
01:20:32,940 --> 01:20:33,460
Faster.

88
01:20:55,070 --> 01:20:55,610
Damn it.

89
01:21:03,170 --> 01:21:04,430
Down the alley.

90
01:22:05,070 --> 01:22:06,010
Use the bumper. That's what it's for.

91
01:22:06,580 --> 01:22:07,650
Nazad.

92
01:23:44,150 --> 01:23:45,550
What was that ?

93
01:24:23,220 --> 01:24:24,500
Go left.

94
01:25:04,330 --> 01:25:05,830
Get out.

95
01:25:58,650 --> 01:26:03,230
Either you've brought me the perfect gift,
or you've made me a very unhappy man.

96
01:26:04,270 --> 01:26:06,420
Mishkin got to them before I could.

97
01:26:07,420 --> 01:26:09,150
Bond is alive ?

98
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:13,300
- He escaped.
- Good for Bond.

99
01:26:14,970 --> 01:26:16,410
Bad for you.

100
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:20,710
Take a seat, my dear.

101
01:26:38,740 --> 01:26:40,380
You know, James and I
shared everything.

102
01:26:43,250 --> 01:26:44,640
Absolutely everything.

103
01:26:51,010 --> 01:26:52,270
To the victor go the spoils.

104
01:27:02,510 --> 01:27:03,630
You'll like it where we're going.

105
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:12,170
You may even learn to like me.

106
01:27:22,550 --> 01:27:23,650
Stay with her.

107
01:27:30,860 --> 01:27:32,700
Bond. Only Bond.

108
01:27:33,550 --> 01:27:35,530
He's going to derail us.

109
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:38,200
Full speed.

110
01:27:39,430 --> 01:27:41,380
Full speed. Ram him.

111
01:28:45,960 --> 01:28:49,160
Why can't you just
be a good boy and die ?

112
01:28:49,790 --> 01:28:50,610
You first.

113
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:52,350
You second.

114
01:28:56,110 --> 01:28:57,150
Up.

115
01:28:59,640 --> 01:29:02,980
Situation analysis: hopeless.

116
01:29:03,390 --> 01:29:05,430
You have no backup, no escape route.

117
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:09,140
And I have the only bargaining chip.

118
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:14,810
- Where is she ?
- Ah, yes. Your fatal weakness.

119
01:29:15,060 --> 01:29:18,290
Ourumov, bring her in.

120
01:29:20,030 --> 01:29:21,540
Lovely girl.

121
01:29:23,010 --> 01:29:26,400
Tastes like... like strawberries.

122
01:29:27,060 --> 01:29:29,590
- I wouldn't know.
- I would.

123
01:29:37,350 --> 01:29:39,120
So, back where we started, James.

124
01:29:40,430 --> 01:29:42,160
Your friend, or the mission ?

125
01:29:43,430 --> 01:29:45,770
Drop the gun. I'll let her live.

126
01:29:49,300 --> 01:29:53,900
Ourumov, what has
this Cossack promised you ?

127
01:29:55,090 --> 01:29:58,390
You knew, didn't you ?
He's a Lienz Cossack.

128
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:03,190
- It's in the past.
- He'll betray you. Just like everyone else.

129
01:30:04,050 --> 01:30:06,440
- Is this true ?
- What's true is that in 48 hours

130
01:30:06,690 --> 01:30:09,370
you and I will have more money than God.

131
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:12,950
and Mr Bond here will have
a small memorial service

132
01:30:13,540 --> 01:30:16,820
with only Moneypenny and a few
tearful restaurateurs in attendance.

133
01:30:19,220 --> 01:30:21,450
So, what's the choice, James ?

134
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:25,870
Two targets, time enough for one shot.

135
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:28,580
The girl, or the mission ?

136
01:30:29,580 --> 01:30:32,210
Kill her. She means nothing to me.

137
01:30:34,680 --> 01:30:36,980
Kill her. She means nothing to me.

138
01:30:48,250 --> 01:30:51,470
- One-inch armour plating.
- I'm fine, thank you very much !

139
01:30:57,430 --> 01:30:59,050
Boris. Yes.

140
01:31:00,010 --> 01:31:03,450
- What are you doing ?
- Boris is on-line backing up his files.

141
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:06,880
If I can spike him, I might be able
to find out where they're going.

142
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:13,390
- Don't stand there. Get us out of here.
- Yes, sir.

143
01:31:32,420 --> 01:31:33,580
Good luck with the floor, James.

144
01:31:34,110 --> 01:31:37,720
I set the timers for six minutes
the same six minutes you gave me.

145
01:31:38,670 --> 01:31:40,370
It was the least I could do for a friend.

146
01:31:43,540 --> 01:31:46,040
- What does that mean ?
- We've got three minutes.

147
01:32:21,480 --> 01:32:23,480
- What else do you call your bottom ?
- What ?

148
01:32:22,900 --> 01:32:26,880
Boris' password. He plays word games.
"What I sit on but don't take with me".

149
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:28,850
- Chair.
- Like I said...

150
01:32:34,570 --> 01:32:35,730
30 seconds.

151
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,880
He's not in Russia,
Germany, Paris, London, Madrid...

152
01:32:39,460 --> 01:32:42,020
- 25 seconds.
- New York, Toronto, Chicago,

153
01:32:42,340 --> 01:32:43,960
- San Francisco...
- 20 seconds.

154
01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:46,660
Mexico City, Rio, Miami...

155
01:32:46,980 --> 01:32:55,830
- Come on.
- Wait. He's in Cuba. Havana... No.

156
01:32:58,110 --> 01:32:59,170
Now.

157
01:33:18,660 --> 01:33:20,870
Do you destroy
every vehicle you get into ?

158
01:33:21,320 --> 01:33:23,470
Standard operating procedure.

159
01:33:25,810 --> 01:33:27,070
Boys with toys.

160
01:33:30,980 --> 01:33:33,910
Maybe I should take care of
the transportation for our trip to Cuba.

161
01:33:34,330 --> 01:33:36,970
Our trip ?

162
01:33:37,650 --> 01:33:39,230
Do you know how to disarm the weapon ?

163
01:33:40,710 --> 01:33:46,280
I suppose that depends on what kind of
weapon you're talking about disarming.

164
01:33:48,550 --> 01:33:56,650
So, tell me. Are there any other
standard operating procedures

165
01:33:56,970 --> 01:33:59,360
I should be aware of, Commander ?
661
01:34:02,943 --> 01:34:03,986
Thousands.

166
01:34:05,430 --> 01:34:07,320
But I only pay them

167
01:34:08,030 --> 01:34:09,640
lip service.

168
01:34:32,990 --> 01:34:35,440
My whole life I dreamed
about coming to the Caribbean.

169
01:34:36,830 --> 01:34:37,960
It's so beautiful.

170
01:34:39,050 --> 01:34:40,530
Not another human being in sight.

171
01:34:54,210 --> 01:34:56,390
What is it with you and moving vehicles ?

172
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:26,990
Yo, Jimbo. Brought a little gift
from old whatshisname ? T ? Z ?

173
01:35:27,230 --> 01:35:29,170
- Q.
- Yeah.

174
01:35:29,480 --> 01:35:32,440
- What are you doing here, Wade?
- Banyan trees.

175
01:35:32,940 --> 01:35:35,420
I am not here. The CIA has
no knowledge, no involvement.

176
01:35:35,710 --> 01:35:38,050
Nothing to do with your insertion
into Cuba, if you catch my drift.

177
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:40,150
Yes, I do.

178
01:35:40,370 --> 01:35:43,060
Borrowed the plane
from a friend in the DEA.

179
01:35:45,790 --> 01:35:48,080
The Coast Guard and the FAA
are in the loop.

180
01:35:48,250 --> 01:35:50,920
You're cleared on our radar
for 06:00 hours.

181
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:53,380
Here's the latest sat-int from Langley.

182
01:35:53,540 --> 01:35:57,250
- Stay below 600 feet.
- 500 feet.

183
01:35:57,420 --> 01:35:59,920
- Who's that ?
- Natalya Simonova.

184
01:36:00,090 --> 01:36:03,090
- Sim-yo-nova.
- Russian minister of transportation.

185
01:36:06,380 --> 01:36:08,680
Did you check her out ?

186
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:12,720
- Head to toe.
- Right...

187
01:36:13,470 --> 01:36:17,560
So, you're lookin' for a dish the size
of a football field, huh ? Doesn't exist.

188
01:36:17,720 --> 01:36:21,230
- Light a cigar in Cuba and we see it.
- I know it's there.

189
01:36:21,390 --> 01:36:26,230
It's a duplicate of Severnaya, like
your secret transmitters in New Zealand.

190
01:36:26,390 --> 01:36:29,150
I've never been there.
How does she know about that ?

191
01:36:29,310 --> 01:36:34,020
- What if I need backup ?
- Get on the radio. I'll send in the marines.

192
01:36:34,610 --> 01:36:36,980
Anyway, hang a left
at the end of the runway.

193
01:36:37,150 --> 01:36:40,150
- Cuba's 80 miles on your right.
- Yo, Wade.

194
01:36:44,030 --> 01:36:47,320
Just one thing. Don't push
any of the buttons on that car.

195
01:36:47,490 --> 01:36:50,870
- I'm just gonna bomb around in it.
- Exactly.

196
01:36:51,620 --> 01:36:54,330
Yo, James. I got faith, but be careful.

197
01:36:54,490 --> 01:36:57,160
He knows you're comin'.

198
01:37:59,290 --> 01:38:01,400
He was your friend - Trevelyan.

199
01:38:03,810 --> 01:38:05,990
And now he's your enemy
and you will kill him.

200
01:38:08,220 --> 01:38:10,570
It is that simple ?

201
01:38:12,120 --> 01:38:13,980
In a word, yes.

202
01:38:15,460 --> 01:38:17,700
- Unless he kills you first.
- Natalya...

203
01:38:17,950 --> 01:38:21,810
You think I'm impressed? With your guns,
your killing, your death. For what ?

204
01:38:22,920 --> 01:38:24,240
So you can be a hero ?

205
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:27,480
- All the heroes I know are dead.
- Natalya...

206
01:38:28,450 --> 01:38:31,950
How can you act like this ?
How can you be so cold ?

207
01:38:34,410 --> 01:38:36,150
It's what keeps me alive.

208
01:38:38,270 --> 01:38:41,290
No. It's what keeps you alone.

209
01:39:20,760 --> 01:39:21,820
James...

210
01:39:24,370 --> 01:39:24,840
Yes ?

211
01:39:32,810 --> 01:39:33,790
On the train,

212
01:39:35,970 --> 01:39:40,040
when you told him to kill me
and that I meant nothing to you,

213
01:39:40,460 --> 01:39:42,140
did you mean it ?

214
01:39:44,450 --> 01:39:45,000
Yes.

215
01:39:47,330 --> 01:39:50,290
Basic rule: always call their bluff.

216
01:39:55,850 --> 01:39:56,400
No.

217
01:40:29,900 --> 01:40:33,810
Turn ten degrees south, bearing 1-8-4.

218
01:40:34,440 --> 01:40:35,280
Yes, sir.

219
01:41:00,840 --> 01:41:02,870
Nothing. There is nothing here.

220
01:41:04,710 --> 01:41:06,010
Let's make another pass.

221
01:41:20,050 --> 01:41:22,400
Maybe Wade was right. There is no dish.

222
01:42:21,160 --> 01:42:21,990
Natalya.

223
01:43:22,950 --> 01:43:27,560
This time, Mr Bond,
the pleasure will be all mine.

224
01:43:46,410 --> 01:43:48,740
You wait for your turn.

225
01:44:22,950 --> 01:44:24,830
She always did enjoy a good squeeze.

226
01:44:36,770 --> 01:44:39,750
- Is the satellite in range?
- Six minutes.

227
01:44:40,150 --> 01:44:42,710
- Prepare the dish.
- No. It's too early.

228
01:44:43,450 --> 01:44:45,450
- I am not ready.
- Do it.

229
01:45:17,100 --> 01:45:18,260
No wonder we couldn't see it.

230
01:45:29,430 --> 01:45:30,960
Come on.

231
01:45:46,860 --> 01:45:48,330
The world's greatest cash card.

232
01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:52,490
It had better not be rejected.

233
01:46:57,010 --> 01:46:59,600
- Mischa is on-line.
- Sir.

234
01:47:05,780 --> 01:47:06,490
Kill him.

235
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:09,750
The man just won't take a hint.

236
01:47:11,880 --> 01:47:15,810
- Target coordinates ?
- The target is London.

237
01:47:28,570 --> 01:47:30,010
He's getting ready to signal the satellite.

238
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:33,950
- How do you stop it ?
- The transmitter above the antenna.

239
01:48:06,200 --> 01:48:07,950
Antenna in position.

240
01:48:10,840 --> 01:48:12,490
On my count.

241
01:48:13,550 --> 01:48:17,460
Three, two, one.

242
01:48:46,260 --> 01:48:47,450
God save the Queen.

243
01:49:07,440 --> 01:49:10,080
- The mainframe computer.
- Don't move.

244
01:50:37,510 --> 01:50:40,280
James. What an unpleasant surprise.

245
01:50:40,920 --> 01:50:42,970
- We aim to please.
- Where's the girl ?

246
01:50:44,700 --> 01:50:45,390
Find her.

247
01:50:53,020 --> 01:50:54,600
So, how is old Q ?

248
01:50:55,880 --> 01:50:57,420
Up to his usual tricks ?

249
01:50:59,260 --> 01:51:00,150
The watch.

250
01:51:06,540 --> 01:51:09,690
A new model. Still press here, do I ?

251
01:51:27,030 --> 01:51:28,740
Interesting setup, Alec.

252
01:51:29,910 --> 01:51:32,360
You break into the Bank of England
via computer,

253
01:51:32,750 --> 01:51:34,320
then transfer the money electronically

254
01:51:35,390 --> 01:51:37,620
just seconds before
you set off the GoldenEye,

255
01:51:38,610 --> 01:51:40,830
which erases any record
of the transactions.

256
01:51:42,510 --> 01:51:44,870
- Ingenious.
- Thank you, James.

257
01:51:45,660 --> 01:51:47,580
But it still boils down to petty theft.

258
01:51:49,260 --> 01:51:53,610
In the end, you're just a bank robber.
Nothing more than a common thief.

259
01:52:04,380 --> 01:52:06,120
You always did have
a small mind, James.

260
01:52:07,170 --> 01:52:11,400
It's not just erasing bank records. It's
everything on every computer in London.

261
01:52:12,280 --> 01:52:16,950
Tax records, the stock market,
credit ratings, land registries,

262
01:52:17,230 --> 01:52:18,360
criminal records.

263
01:52:18,560 --> 01:52:23,550
In 16 minutes and 43... no, 42 seconds,,

264
01:52:24,260 --> 01:52:26,070
the United Kingdom
will re-enter the Stone Age.

265
01:52:26,720 --> 01:52:28,700
A worldwide financial meltdown.

266
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:34,290
And all so mad little Alec can settle
a score with the world 50 years on.

267
01:52:34,620 --> 01:52:39,200
Please, James. Spare me the Freud.
I might as well ask you

268
01:52:39,440 --> 01:52:42,270
if all the vodka martinis ever silence
the screams of all the men you've killed.

269
01:52:46,360 --> 01:52:48,370
Or if you find forgiveness
in the arms of all those willing women

270
01:52:48,660 --> 01:52:52,000
for all the dead ones
you failed to protect.

271
01:52:54,890 --> 01:52:57,330
England is about to learn
the cost of betrayal,

272
01:52:58,460 --> 01:53:00,760
inflation-adjusted for 1945.

273
01:53:03,880 --> 01:53:06,630
- Welcome to the party, my dear.
- Natalya.

274
01:53:41,280 --> 01:53:45,080
Don't ever do that again.

275
01:53:45,340 --> 01:53:48,470
This is not one of your games, Boris.
Real people will die.

276
01:53:48,840 --> 01:53:50,670
You pathetic little worm.

277
01:53:52,620 --> 01:53:54,560
She was in the mainframe.
Check the computer.

278
01:53:55,160 --> 01:53:59,000
She's a moron.
A second-level programmer.

279
01:53:59,640 --> 01:54:01,850
She works on the guidance system.

280
01:54:02,770 --> 01:54:05,860
She doesn't even have access
to the firing codes.

281
01:54:10,360 --> 01:54:11,800
Retro-rockets firing.

282
01:54:31,090 --> 01:54:35,960
- What the hell's happening ?
- We will have re-entry in 12 minutes.

283
01:54:38,340 --> 01:54:40,880
It will burn up
somewhere over the Atlantic.

284
01:54:41,050 --> 01:54:44,730
- Deal with it.
- She changed the access codes.

285
01:54:45,140 --> 01:54:47,050
Then she can fix it.

286
01:54:51,630 --> 01:54:54,990
Go ahead. Shoot him.
He means nothing to me.

287
01:54:56,230 --> 01:54:58,950
I can do it. I can break her codes.

288
01:54:59,460 --> 01:55:01,590
Then get on with it.

289
01:55:29,960 --> 01:55:31,360
Tell him. Now.

290
01:55:32,260 --> 01:55:35,960
Give me the codes, Natalya.
Give them to me.

291
01:55:51,570 --> 01:55:54,260
- Can Boris break your codes ?
- Possibly.

292
01:55:54,420 --> 01:55:55,760
Possibly ?

293
01:55:57,180 --> 01:55:58,860
We have to destroy the transmitter.

294
01:55:59,920 --> 01:56:02,250
By the way, I'm fine,
thank you very much !

295
01:56:31,730 --> 01:56:32,780
Do you know how to use one of these ?

296
01:56:35,570 --> 01:56:36,640
Yes.

297
01:56:38,360 --> 01:56:40,200
Good. Stay out of sight.

298
01:56:55,300 --> 01:56:56,540
- How long ?
- Two minutes.

299
01:56:57,420 --> 01:56:59,070
- One minute.
- Guard.

300
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:02,780
- I'm fixing it.
- If he moves, kill him.

301
01:58:26,130 --> 01:58:29,210
Yes. I am invincible.

302
02:00:39,780 --> 02:00:42,780
You know, James ?

303
02:00:42,950 --> 02:00:44,820
I was always better.

304
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:03,130
Alpha One to Gunship.

305
02:01:04,250 --> 02:01:06,750
Alpha One to Gunship.

306
02:02:07,410 --> 02:02:09,200
Speak to me.

307
02:02:44,350 --> 02:02:46,390
For England, James ?

308
02:02:47,100 --> 02:02:48,470
No.

309
02:02:49,430 --> 02:02:50,810
For me.

310
02:04:10,140 --> 02:04:12,560
Yes. I am invincible.

311
02:04:37,400 --> 02:04:40,860
James. James. Are you all right ?

312
02:04:44,830 --> 02:04:47,120
Yes, I'm fine. Thank you.

313
02:04:57,290 --> 02:04:59,960
Suppose someone is watching ?

314
02:05:01,040 --> 02:05:04,580
There's no one within 25 miles,
believe me.

315
02:05:04,750 --> 02:05:07,130
Yo, Jimbo.

316
02:05:15,670 --> 02:05:19,970
Is this supposed to be your idea
of "coming through in a clinch" ?

317
02:05:21,680 --> 02:05:23,930
It's tobacco plants.

318
02:05:24,100 --> 02:05:25,970
I said I'd be here, huh ?

319
02:05:26,140 --> 02:05:28,350
Yo. Marines.

320
02:05:38,480 --> 02:05:43,940
Maybe you two'd like to finish debriefing
each other at Guantanamo ?

321
02:05:44,610 --> 02:05:47,190
- Ready ?
- I'm not going on a helicopter with you.

322
02:05:47,360 --> 02:05:50,320
No plane, no train, nothing that moves.

323
02:05:50,480 --> 02:05:53,860
Darling, what could
possibly go wrong, hey ?
