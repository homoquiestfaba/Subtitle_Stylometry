1
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,362
<i>It's</i> a
<i>beautiful Birmingham morning</i>

2
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,046
<i>and the holiday season
looks merry and bright.</i>

3
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,128
<i>Are you ready for the holidays?</i>

4
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,565
<i>Not me.</i>

5
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,808
<i>Man, I got five kids.</i>

6
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,450
<i>Four of them are mine.</i>

7
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,289
<i>Allegedly.</i>

8
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,609
<i>Have you been naughty?
Or have you been nice?</i>

9
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,562
<i>So many people coming into town.</i>

10
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,641
<i>What about you?</i>

11
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,449
<i>You got family or friends
coming to town?</i>

12
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,087
<i>Me?</i>

13
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,481
<i>I hope it's not my in-laws.</i>

14
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,164
<i>Unless they're listening.</i>

15
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,086
<i>If so, I can't wait to see ya!</i>

16
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,885
<i>On the way, a little music to
get you in the holiday spirit.</i>

17
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,086
<i>Merry Christmas!</i>

18
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,766
Yeah.

19
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,641
All right.

20
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,086
Here we go.

21
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,321
I'm sorry.
I need to take this. Here.

22
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,721
Daddy, what's going on?
Your message sounded urgent.

23
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,326
I can't find that tin of hers.

24
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,890
The ones with Mama's recipes?

25
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,041
<i>Yeah.</i>

26
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,566
They're where the pots
and pans are, Daddy.

27
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,085
You're not trying
to cook, are you?

28
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,447
Not without those recipes,
I'm not.

29
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,567
Okay, good.

30
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,800
Now, don't drive yourself
too crazy with it, all right?

31
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,410
You know how you can get.

32
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,369
<i>I can't wait to see you all.</i>

33
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,602
Even your sister?

34
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,445
<i>I can count on you two to be
civil with each other, right?</i>

35
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,409
Yeah, of course.
I can't wait to see Rachel.

36
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,529
<i>I'll be civil with her as
long as she's civil with me.</i>

37
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,936
You know,
I'm looking forward to it.

38
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,040
Rach, can I please
finish what I'm saying?

39
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,409
Look, I'm just saying that we all want to
spend as much time as we can with Dad.

40
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,216
What's wrong with me trying
to get you there faster?

41
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,280
<i>I'm not some charity case.</i>

42
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,642
Just because I'm in law school doesn't
mean I can't afford to buy plane tickets.

43
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,880
That's exactly what it means.

44
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,326
We talked about this.

45
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,410
Ma'am?
Yes?

46
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,811
This tire's got a hole in it.

47
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,363
Just put on the spare.

48
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,240
You mean, one of the two
you're already using?

49
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,404
Hey! Yeah, I gotta go.

50
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,682
Well, there's always the bus.

51
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,841
Why?

52
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,976
Promise me you are not gonna be
on that phone the entire holiday.

53
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,001
I'm not. That was Rach.

54
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,447
And you do realize I'm in the
middle of a campaign, right?

55
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,931
Yes, and I support you.

56
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,126
Give me that bunny!

57
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,281
No!

58
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,407
Slow, please.

59
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,440
But family time is important too, which
is why you have a campaign manager.

60
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,163
Besides, it's only a week.

61
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,522
Promise me we'll have fun
at your dad's.

62
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,681
Promise.

63
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,361
Family time.

64
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,966
I was cutting it off.

65
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,202
I thought you were
getting here last night?

66
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,965
Well, coach dropped another practice
on us, but I'm on my way now.

67
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,122
All right, all right.
Just drive safe.

68
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,488
And none of that Tweetbooking,
or Faceprogramming

69
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,800
<i>or Snap whatever that is, okay?</i>

70
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,921
Dad, it's...
88.

71
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,336
I gotta go. Yeah.
I'ma see you soon.

72
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,361
Okay. I love you.

73
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,408
Love you too, Pops.
No, stay down. Stay down.

74
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,968
Got an early Christmas gift.

75
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,011
Shoulder's good as new.
Yes!

76
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,606
You can finally get off those
meds and back on the field

77
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,604
because you've been cleared
for the bowl game!

78
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,681
Yes!

79
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,525
Yo, 88 is back
in the building, man!

80
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,965
Yeah. Thank you, Coach.

81
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:16,367
Listen, I am really proud of all the hard
work you've been putting in lately.

82
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,441
Thanks.

83
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,211
And I know that this is gonna be
your first holiday at home since...

84
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,281
Coach, you know what?

85
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,685
I'm really good. I'm good.

86
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,450
All right. Happy holidays.

87
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,846
Yeah, same.

88
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,923
All right.
Listen up, everyone.

89
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,208
I don't want you pigging out
over the holidays.

90
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,327
Gotta win this thing.

91
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,289
Come on, Coach.
It's Christmas!

92
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,371
I love how the ring
just glimmers.

93
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,169
See? When the light hits it?

94
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,329
I was a champion in Croatia.

95
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,970
You know I played
in the NBA also?

96
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,202
1991, Seattle SuperSonics.

97
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,602
I made the last shot
in the playoffs.

98
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,843
They called me
Lonnie "Shatao" Maclay.

99
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,920
You know what Shatao is?

100
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,328
Shatao is the sound that the ball
makes when it goes through the net.

101
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,767
Shatao! Like, Shatao!

102
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,207
So, would you like
a mid-size or a sedan?

103
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,328
Could I get a little
help here, Lonnie, huh?

104
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,447
A sedan!

105
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,363
What are you talking
about over there?

106
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,169
Will you help me with the bags?

107
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,642
Here's a little
early Christmas gift.

108
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,407
Could be worth a lot
of money on eBay.

109
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,045
But let it marinate.

110
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,485
Okay. Okay?

111
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,241
Lonnie!

112
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,720
Did you bring those damn cards?

113
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,521
Shatao!

114
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,801
Your face.

115
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,841
Yeah.

116
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,246
Shit!

117
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,401
Yeah!

118
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,325
Oh, man.

119
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,481
I'm trying.

120
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,090
May Devaroux, Johnson, Davis...

121
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,605
Shit, there was a lot of them.

122
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,883
I am here. And how's my
favorite brother-in-law doing?

123
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,881
May, I'm your only
brother-in-law.

124
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,411
Well, lucky you!

125
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,246
Damn, I forgot how old you are.

126
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,490
Come on, give it to me.

127
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,765
How you doing, baby?

128
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,841
It's coming.

129
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,091
It's coming.

130
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,361
You holding on?

131
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,441
I'm holding on.

132
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,601
You holding on, baby.

133
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,641
Yeah, I was expecting you
in a day, or two, or three...

134
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,450
If I'd have known,
I would have...

135
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,329
Dusted. Damn, Walter!

136
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,080
Changed the locks.

137
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,088
Your ass is old, so I'm
gonna let that one slide.

138
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,611
Now, I just thought my brother-in-law
could use a little extra help

139
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,125
so I said, what the hell.

140
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,005
And Stevie Wonder blind ass
done canceled the tour

141
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,416
because they gave him
the schedule.

142
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,728
Who gonna give his blind ass
the schedule? Damn!

143
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,564
Messing with my money, baby.

144
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,847
But such is the life
of a background singer.

145
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,649
Now, listen, my bags are in the driveway
so be a dear and go get them for me.

146
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,096
And I'ma whip
a little something up

147
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,856
so the kids have something
to eat when they get here.

148
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,008
Perfect. As long as
I don't have to eat it.

149
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,163
Walter Meyers, you can kiss
all my ass, okay?

150
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,164
You know the shit I cook is
good shit. Don't do that now.

151
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,960
You've been eating that bad shit.
That's why your ass looks so frail.

152
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,850
Look at yourself.
Knees knocking and shit.

153
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,326
And where's the liquor, Walter?

154
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,568
And I hope it ain't
that dark liquor, damn it.

155
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,689
Because that dark liquor
make a bitch wanna fight!

156
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,040
<i>Pop-pop!</i>

157
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,971
We made it!

158
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,690
Hi, Grandpa!
Hi!

159
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,489
You're even prettier
than I last saw you.

160
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,890
Yeah! How do you do that?

161
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,961
I don't know.

162
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,610
How you doing, Granddad?

163
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,763
You still hitting those books, I see.
Yes, sir.

164
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,605
Yes, he got six A's and one B.

165
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,170
The B was in gym.

166
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,965
When your Uncle Evan gets here,
he can help you out with that.

167
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,849
Grandpa, can I go inside
and get some cookies?

168
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,285
Of course you can!

169
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,284
Cameron! Just one. Just one!
I want some too!

170
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,456
It'll be fine. Just, come on.
Honey?

171
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,656
He's always working.
Give me a second.

172
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,886
Sweetheart!

173
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,644
Hey! Hey! Hey! Pop!

174
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,371
Man, don't do that.

175
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,721
Aw!

176
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,281
How are you, Pop?

177
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,489
I'm a little tired, but a
lot better seeing you all.

178
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,082
Oh, my God! ls that...

179
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,891
Christian, you promised.
Family time.

180
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,856
No, no. That's what this will...
That's what this is.

181
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,963
He's here so that I won't have
to be on the phone as much.

182
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,088
Which gives me more time for family.
Oh, my God.

183
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,536
Andy Brooks.
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

184
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,976
He's my campaign manager, Pop.

185
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,721
Boy, you have raised a very
promising, young, future congressman

186
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,451
and his beautiful wife,
who you didn't raise.

187
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,726
You raised him. He's your son.

188
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,520
Hope that doesn't come
as a surprise to you.

189
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,456
I didn't know you're
campaigning over the holidays.

190
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,561
These cookies are amazing!

191
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,721
Give me that.

192
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,526
Hey, Cameron. Take
your aunt's luggage in. There.

193
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,045
That's a lot of luggage.

194
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,645
Probably half of them are wigs.

195
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,211
Hey, and take yours in.

196
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,441
We're staying here?

197
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,891
Mmm-hmm.
Yay!

198
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,611
Hold on, son. We're not staying here.
We're staying at a hotel.

199
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,011
We are staying at the hotel?

200
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,128
I thought we were. I assumed.
Let me talk.

201
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,486
No.
No.

202
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,643
Pop, we got a hotel room because
we didn't wanna be a bother.

203
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,404
Family is never a bother.

204
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,484
We're all going
to stay right here.

205
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,642
The kids can sleep in
the bunk beds in the basement.

206
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,210
Aw! Thanks, Pop.
Yeah. Okay.

207
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,009
This is great.
Sounds good to me.

208
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,684
Sounds good to you?

209
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,205
Really, Brooks?

210
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,488
You know what?
I'm gonna like that hotel.

211
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,690
It's actually a really good hotel. They
got a free breakfast and a free spa.

212
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,286
And I encourage everybody
to join me. For the breakfast.

213
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,091
I think the four of us
in a spa would...

214
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,296
Just a little bit. Thanks.
Okay.

215
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,736
This is the last time
I'm gonna let you...

216
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,966
I know. I know.

217
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,969
He's a lot, but he's
the best at what he does.

218
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,280
Sir, sir.

219
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,647
I just wanted to express
my condolences on your loss.

220
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,042
The African American woman is the
backbone of the black family.

221
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,043
Really of the whole
American family.

222
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,647
I mean, who wasn't raised by a black woman?
I know I was.

223
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,816
You know what?
I'm getting a phone call,

224
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:50,401
so I'm gonna have to put a
pause on this conversation,

225
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,891
which I'm really
enjoying. It's...

226
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:55,646
You're a wonderful conversationalist.
I hope someone's told you that.

227
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,131
Dan! Dan, you said
the call was in 15 minutes.

228
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,801
See them at the game.

229
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,968
Yeah, man. I got the pics.
I'm on my way.

230
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,690
Hey, what's up?
Hey, Evan.

231
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,401
I got them, man.
I'm on my way right now.

232
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,456
I'ma hit you tomorrow though,
because I can't kick it tonight.

233
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,686
I'ma hit you after church.

234
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,491
Boy, you ain't going to church, man.
Get outta here.

235
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,051
No, no! No, I got it.
All right.

236
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,963
I got it.
Happy holidays.

237
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,080
Okay.

238
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,201
Twigs!

239
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,681
Who's Twigs?

240
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,963
My nickname in high school.

241
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,128
Rachel, Rachel, Rachel.
What's up?

242
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,406
Hey!

243
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,051
You must be Niya.

244
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,600
We haven't been properly
introduced. I'm Malachi.

245
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,081
Nice to meet you.

246
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,969
Let me grab these bags.
I got it.

247
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,969
Don't bother. Let me
help you with your bags.

248
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,042
Why? Because I'm a woman,
I can't help myself?

249
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,846
No. Because I'm a grown man,
and that's what grown men do.

250
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,081
Munchie?

251
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:00,205
Munchie, don't forget to get the
Eskimo Pies from the store, baby.

252
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,281
Okay, Mama.

253
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,603
And would you get
me the vinegar potato chips, baby?

254
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,166
All right, and a mud pie.

255
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,446
Okay, Mama.

256
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,645
Hey, Rachel!

257
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,887
You know he's single.

258
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,081
Ha.

259
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,723
Rach!
Auntie!

260
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,484
Hey!
Hi, baby!

261
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,401
Hey, Malachi!

262
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,725
Cameron! Dee!

263
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,960
So, where's your husband?

264
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,690
Ex-husband.
Yeah?

265
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,842
Oh. Oh.

266
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,049
Since I'm here visiting my mom for
the week, maybe we can grab a...

267
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,121
I'm okay.

268
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,491
You sure you don't want a hand?

269
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,801
No, thanks.

270
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,002
No, no. No, I got it. Thank you.
You sure?

271
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,360
It's not a problem.
No. I got it.

272
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,811
Those bags look heavy.

273
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,001
I got it.

274
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,048
Clearly,
it's a different technique.

275
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,646
See? I had it.

276
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,121
Had it the whole time.
I do Pilates. So...

277
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,681
This girl.

278
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,569
Somebody come
help me with these bags!

279
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,844
I was in the kitchen.
I was helping Aunt May.

280
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,160
Hi!

281
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,441
What's... It still
doesn't even seem real.

282
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,288
I know. I know.

283
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,721
How was your trip?

284
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,804
Good. Good.

285
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,961
How's school?

286
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,050
Good. I may have
to sit out next semester...

287
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,565
What? What are you
talking about?

288
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,721
No. It's expensive.

289
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,643
Who's that making
all that noise out here?

290
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,444
Part-time job. I'll be okay.
Okay.

291
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,966
Hey, Daddy!

292
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,600
How are you?

293
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,727
God!

294
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:45,168
A lot better now that
my little baby girl's here.

295
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,368
How are you really?

296
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,481
Um...

297
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,245
It's Christmas.

298
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,286
I miss you.

299
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,769
Somebody else is here.

300
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:00,083
Guess who? Hi! Daddy!

301
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,525
Hey! Look at you!

302
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,081
Look at you!

303
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,161
God!

304
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,765
Sonya!

305
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,525
Cheryl, I missed you.

306
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,442
You look amazing!
Politics agrees with you.

307
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,760
Thank you!

308
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,721
Hey!

309
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,247
Rachel!

310
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,651
Hi, Cheryl.

311
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,643
Wait. Who is that?
Lonnie!

312
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,406
Hey, Lonnie.

313
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,051
Merry Christmas, everybody!

314
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,046
Good to be here!

315
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,361
Uh-oh. I got a little
something for you.

316
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,250
How about an early
Christmas gift for everybody.

317
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,243
Lonnie, nobody
wants that right now.

318
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,651
Everybody wants it. Come on.

319
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,926
Here you go. One for you.

320
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,936
You get one, and you're going
to appreciate that one.

321
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,176
What is this?
One for you.

322
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,281
You have hair!

323
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,600
Of course I had hair in '93.

324
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,961
Hey, that's going to be
very valuable one day.

325
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,536
I'm telling you, if something happens
to me, something happens to you!

326
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,085
In a good way,
if you know what I mean.

327
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,965
So, hold on to it.

328
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:03,203
Walter, I'm so hungry. I've been traveling.
Right, baby? Oh!

329
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,496
Anything in the kitchen to eat?

330
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,363
Aunt May's putting
something together to eat.

331
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,647
Why does that sound like
a terrorist threat to me?

332
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,769
Say another damn thing, Lonnie!
Your ass is whooped in here tonight!

333
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,496
I'm going to make sure these
two don't kill each other.

334
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,807
Granddad! Can we please
turn on rooftop Santa?

335
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,370
When are we going to turn it on?

336
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,570
I'm sorry, buddy, but I couldn't
get it to work this year.

337
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:26,323
Oh! You know, when I left the
league, I dabbled in electronics.

338
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,401
You know what that means?

339
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,924
That means I'm going to have
that Santa working in no time.

340
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,001
Ding, ding, ding!

341
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,045
Thanks, Uncle Lonnie!

342
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,608
Uncle Lonnie's going
to fix rooftop Santa!

343
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,205
You worked
two weeks at Best Buy.

344
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,926
You're right.
But I worked like a dog!

345
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,766
If I do my math right, that's
like 14 weeks in dog years.

346
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,444
I left that place barking.

347
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,682
They will never forget
Lonnie Maclay.

348
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,371
Uh-oh! Auntie May,
I smell that food.

349
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,771
Uh-oh. Wait a minute.

350
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,201
I'm in the bathroom!

351
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,284
He's a regular Renaissance man.
You should be so proud.

352
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,683
Well, why don't you all
get settled in?

353
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,764
I have to run down to the shelter.
I'll be back in a minute.

354
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,216
Do you want me
to come with you, Daddy?

355
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,083
No, no, no.
Yeah, no. I'll come.

356
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,369
No, no, no.
You two, you connect up.

357
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,847
You haven't seen each other,
I don't know when.

358
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,570
I'll be back, okay?

359
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,485
Love you both.

360
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,761
Walter?

361
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,204
Hi!

362
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,567
Oh. Good.

363
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,968
My goodness!
It's so good to have you here.

364
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,040
Oh, boy.

365
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,970
Christmas would not be
Christmas without you.

366
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,441
And my Grace, you couldn't
drag her away from here.

367
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,931
Remember when
the lights went out?

368
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:46,001
Yeah, the lights went out. You
know I'm scared of the dark.

369
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,162
We tried to find
candles everywhere.

370
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,605
Everything.

371
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,810
I'm telling you, you and Grace
were my best friends.

372
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,928
I know.
I've missed you guys so much.

373
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,326
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

374
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,447
Hey, Walter.
All right.

375
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,683
Thank you. I have something for you.
Okay.

376
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,491
I do.

377
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,562
Grace had it framed

378
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,211
and she didn't have a chance
to give it to you.

379
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,523
Who knew her sweet heart
would give out so suddenly?

380
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,287
She's so beautiful.

381
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,727
I'll be right back.

382
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,245
All right.

383
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,926
Hi, kids! Don't forget, we have
finger painting later today.

384
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,001
Wow.

385
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,888
You sure are fine, girl.

386
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,602
I don't look that bad either.

387
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,696
Sorry it took so long for dinner.
I hope y'all ready.

388
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,736
I figured y'all would be hungry
from all that traveling,

389
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,256
so I put a little something
together for y'all.

390
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,362
You shouldn't have.

391
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,256
You didn't have to go through
all that trouble, Aunt May.

392
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,363
Baby, this is no trouble at all.
Now y'all are my family.

393
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,841
And this right here,

394
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:57,323
this is my spiced mung bean
winter casserole.

395
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,642
Got that from Ike
and Tina Turner, 1972.

396
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,246
And right here,

397
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:06,531
this is my Korean dry, squid
salad with authentic kimchi.

398
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:10,127
Mick Jagger, 1983.
That was a special tour.

399
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,966
This looks like
all the ingredients to vomit.

400
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,691
And this here is Aunt May's
prized possession, baby.

401
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,211
I put my foot in this.

402
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,090
This is my potato salad
from Poland.

403
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,289
Pickled fish, duck sausage
with mayonnaise.

404
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,850
And to wash it all down,

405
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,806
some milk tea
with boiled tapioca balls.

406
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,962
Little Richard gave me
that one. Yes!

407
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,001
Who wants pizza?
Me!

408
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,081
I do!
Extra sausage.

409
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,456
- Pepperoni!
- We like thick crust.

410
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,016
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Thick crust.

411
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,121
Hey! Wait a minute.

412
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,091
Your Aunt May went through a lot
of trouble preparing all this.

413
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,207
Yes, I did.

414
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,647
The least we could do

415
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,042
is to eat her...

416
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,567
What's this?

417
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,640
Thank you, Walter.

418
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,125
Because this right here, baby,

419
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,569
this is my spiced mung bean
winter casserole

420
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,681
with a hint of...

421
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,761
Spam.

422
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,444
Limburger cheese.
Baby lotion?

423
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,966
You all remind my ass
when to laugh, okay?

424
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:09,010
Aunt May, this looks
like a million bucks.

425
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,081
Thank you, baby.

426
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,288
And Cameron is going to be
the first one to try it.

427
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,966
Wait! Why do I have to eat it?
I didn't do anything wrong!

428
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,336
Don't talk back
to your mother, boy.

429
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,486
Why can't you eat it?

430
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,656
Don't talk back to your daddy.

431
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,682
Y'all are all going
to owe me a huge apology.

432
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,966
Here we go.

433
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,441
Just a little taste
to kick off the celebration.

434
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,520
I don't want to die.

435
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,846
Open your mouth.

436
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:30,447
Here, hold his nose. Hold his
nose so he opens his mouth.

437
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,284
Be a man now.
Hold his nose!

438
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,402
Open! Okay.
Open up. Get it in.

439
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,130
There you go.
Seal it!

440
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,685
- Chew it!
- Cameron, are you okay?

441
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,330
You ungrateful bastards!

442
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,686
The whole lot of you!

443
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,856
Now I'm in there slaving my ass
off trying to make it right.

444
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,963
You think his ass upset right now? Wait
till he finds out you not his daddy.

445
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,041
Aunt May!
Aunt May!

446
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,646
It's not that we wouldn't like it.
We just don't recognize it.

447
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,881
Kiss my ass.

448
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,610
Put it on a plate then.

449
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,656
And I guarantee you it's better
than this food on this table.

450
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,330
And I don't know
where your ass been at.

451
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,447
Lonnie.

452
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,761
Am I wrong?

453
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,081
I'm sorry, Walter.

454
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,400
Look, well, at least
there's bread.

455
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,736
Here, baby, have some bread.
Here, have some bread.

456
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,416
Baby, you know, Brooks has
got me on a meal plan.

457
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,521
Mommy!

458
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,656
It doesn't look good in here.

459
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,727
It's a low-carb...

460
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:15,362
Daddy, Aunt May doesn't think she's actually
cooking Christmas dinner, does she?

461
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,851
With any luck, she's not.

462
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:20,367
Grace always believed in
everybody pitching in.

463
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,361
Grandma let me snap the peas.

464
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,363
She did, she did.

465
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,090
She used to make me
clean a tub of greens.

466
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:29,243
She would be like, "Rachel, make sure
you get those bugs out them greens."

467
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,367
Yeah.

468
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:34,001
Somehow I always ended up having a
ton of bugs in my greens anyway.

469
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,243
But you barreled through. Didn't you?
Didn't let that stop you.

470
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,845
Extra protein.
Yeah.

471
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:42,926
Remember after I got married, Mom
finally let me make the stuffing?

472
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,650
That obviously didn't work out.

473
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,881
Okay, really?

474
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,201
I was talking
about the dressing.

475
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,123
You cannot help yourself,
and it is baffling.

476
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,248
We were talking about our mother

477
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,936
and somehow you made it
about my marriage.

478
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,930
I wasn't talking about your marriage.
I was talking about your divorce.

479
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,520
At least I was smart enough
to get one.

480
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,564
Smartness! Hey, I'm still in the room.
Okay? Girls!

481
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,291
88's in the house!

482
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,126
Are y'all fighting already?

483
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,576
Niya, pack your stuff.
We're going to a hotel.

484
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,256
A hotel? A hostel, hotel,
it's the same thing.

485
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,456
Girls! It'll be an adventure.
Come on.

486
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,130
Don't waste a bus pass
on my account.

487
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,776
Pack your bags, Lonnie.
Hey, Rachel! That's called karma.

488
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,041
We're getting the hell out of here.
Hey, Rachel! Cheryl!

489
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,886
Here we go.

490
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,849
You two. Get down here now!

491
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,576
What's wrong with you two?
I didn't start this, Daddy.

492
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,696
Oh, my God! You always start it.
Actually, you both started it.

493
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,600
You stay out of it.
You're just making it worse.

494
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,642
I'm makin'...
Okay. I'm Lonnie, now.

495
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,882
This is exactly why I wanted
to stay in a hotel, Pop.

496
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,096
Well, what's stopping you
now, huh?

497
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,360
Nothing's stopping me.

498
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,722
Quiet! Quiet! Hey, quiet!

499
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:48,680
What would your mother say if she could
see you carrying on like this, huh?

500
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,726
Five days.

501
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:57,521
Just five days for you all
to act like a family.

502
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,365
To act like you have the good
sense you were raised with.

503
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,921
Five days so we can make it
through Christmas.

504
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,081
That's all I'm asking.

505
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,490
Can you do that? Huh?

506
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,960
Love you, Pops.

507
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,042
You gotta hug me back.
I need it. There it is!

508
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,488
You all should feel
like a bunch of dumbasses.

509
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,643
No, Aunt May, I came here with
the purest of intentions.

510
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,364
You are just
straight up delusional!

511
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,930
Shut up!
You're the one being stupid!

512
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,081
Shut up!

513
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,891
Now just shut the shit up!
I'm sick of it.

514
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,008
Your daddy too damn old
for all this bullshit.

515
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,416
Now if y'all don't get your asses in
that kitchen and apologize right now,

516
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,091
I'm kicking everybody's ass
in here. Come on.

517
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,321
Well, I just walked in.

518
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,731
Boy, listen here.

519
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,361
Your little ass got on them red Bozo shoes.
That's why you gotta apologize.

520
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,805
Get your asses in the kitchen.

521
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,696
Y'all need to get yourselves together
so we can go to church tomorrow.

522
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,769
Look at this.
Look at this young shit, here.

523
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,049
Push a bitch again!

524
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,964
Push a bitch again!
God damn it!

525
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,521
Y'all gotta go to church
tomorrow. You get there early.

526
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,967
Lonnie, get your ass
away from me.

527
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,804
This don't make no sense.

528
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,162
They're just going
to blow my buzz.

529
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,167
We're not going to make it
to Christmas, are we?

530
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,083
Huh! Not a damn chance.

531
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,480
<i>That's some good liquor
right there, baby.</i>

532
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,440
And the award for the most
outstanding performance

533
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,370
on offense, defense,
and special teams

534
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,046
for the Sportsman
of the Universe...

535
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,322
I'm talking
for the entire millennium.

536
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,802
Ladies and gentlemen,
number 88, Evan Meyers!

537
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,327
Is it...

538
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,970
I can't...

539
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:01,326
You guys are so kind.
My gosh! Thank you!

540
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:08,007
You know what I mean.
That's just how I do.

541
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:30,927
Uncle Evan, Granddad said hurry
up. We're going to be late for church.

542
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,729
All right, Cam. I'm coming.

543
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,604
<i>God, you're holy Yes, you are</i>

544
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,126
<i>God, you're worthy Yes, you are</i>

545
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,884
<i>We give you our praise</i>

546
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:21,521
Now, you know not one of us has been
to church since we left Birmingham.

547
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,696
And now we're just supposed to
come in here and act like...

548
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,210
We anointed!

549
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,009
Praise Him!
Hallelujah!

550
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,366
How are you?

551
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,680
<i>Yes, you are Yes, you are</i>

552
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,728
<i>Yes, you are Yes, you are</i>

553
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,882
<i>Yes, you are Yes, you are</i>

554
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,244
"Unto us a child is born.

555
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,964
"Unto us, a son is given.

556
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,927
"And his name

557
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,048
"shall be called Wonderful."

558
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,764
Wonderful!

559
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,524
Before we get started
this morning,

560
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:00,640
I want to welcome all of our
visitors and our CME Christians.

561
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,530
They only make it on Christmas,
Mother's Day, and Easter.

562
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,922
Also, want to recognize
one of our longest serving

563
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,207
and dearest brothers in Christ,

564
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:16,365
Brother Walter Meyers, here
with his beautiful family.

565
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,010
Lonnie! Lonnie!

566
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,931
Let's not make it about me.
This is about Jesus.

567
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,323
Stop it. Sit down.

568
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:32,208
Now we haven't seen
Brother Meyers for a while

569
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:35,250
since the passing
of our dearest Grace.

570
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,560
You all right, son?

571
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,296
If you're in the
neighborhood... Yeah.

572
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,004
Stop on by and say hello.
Okay.

573
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,082
I'm sure he would
welcome the company.

574
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,161
Amen.

575
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,321
Amen.

576
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,371
Amen.

577
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:52,445
Uncle Lonnie, are we still going
to fix rooftop Santa tonight?

578
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,284
Has Uncle Lonnie
ever let you down?

579
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,006
Yes!
Yes!

580
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,405
Lonnie, don't you think
you should wait for Evan?

581
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,488
Hey, I'm doing it for the kids!

582
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,686
Your kids!

583
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,641
My hands are going up your ass.
Ain't got no gloves or nothing.

584
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,891
Last time a man gave you a
prostate exam with no gloves on?

585
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,611
I really don't think you should be
messing around in there, Lonnie.

586
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,126
Don't listen to the Grinch,
okay? I got this.

587
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,804
Uncle Lonnie got this for you!

588
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,530
Are you kids ready for Santa?

589
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,091
Yeah!
Yeah!

590
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,369
I said, who's ready for Santa?

591
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,010
We are!
We are!

592
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,176
I'm going to make you an icepack

593
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,806
for the knot that's going to
be on your head when you fall.

594
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,096
Come on, give it up for the Grinch.
Give it up for the Grinch.

595
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,930
Cut that out! It's freezing out here.
Let's get in the house!

596
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,401
Auntie, please. Can we stay
for just a little bit longer?

597
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,204
Please, Mommy?

598
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,001
All right.

599
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,246
But the minute he's done,
you come inside, okay?

600
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,402
Okay, Mommy.
Okay, bunny.

601
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,491
Okay.

602
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,766
Careful, Lonnie!

603
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,046
Whatever.

604
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:59,206
I got this. Uncle Lonnie
got this for you, okay?

605
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,850
Uncle Lonnie said
he would do it...

606
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,881
Ooh!

607
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,568
Get out! Ow! Ow!

608
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,201
Whoo!

609
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,082
I got a little buzz
on my finger that time.

610
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,528
Does Uncle Lonnie know
what he's doing?

611
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,647
No.

612
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,003
<i>Ho! Ho! Ho! Merry Christmas!</i>

613
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,320
It's working!

614
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,761
He actually got it!

615
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,841
Great job, Uncle Lonnie.

616
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,001
Who's the man?

617
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,525
Uncle Lonnie!

618
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,960
That's what it's all about!

619
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,047
Ding, ding, ding-
Ding, ding, ding-

620
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,841
Good job, Uncle Lonnie!

621
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,048
Good job! You actually did it!

622
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,851
I did not let the Grinches
ruin Christmas for you.

623
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,445
Uncle Lonnie!
Uncle Lonnie!

624
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,487
That's not good.

625
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,607
Oh! Shit!

626
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,327
Shit!

627
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,287
Oh, shit!

628
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,280
<i>Ho-ho-ho!</i>

629
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,084
Uncle Lonnie killed Santa!

630
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,724
- Hold it! Hold it!
- Mommy!

631
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,689
Did you get that?
I just posted it.

632
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,800
- Good.
- Mommy!

633
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,730
Don't tell Cheryl.
Do not tell Cheryl, okay?

634
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,290
Uncle Lonnie has it, okay?

635
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,050
Shit!
My gosh!

636
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,121
Shit!

637
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,970
Is he still breathing?

638
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,323
We should take a selfie.

639
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:31,286
Don't tell Cheryl.

640
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,041
Hmm.

641
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,001
You could tell me
where the tin is.

642
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,610
Thought I heard somebody
down here.

643
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,569
Hey, sweetheart.
Hey.

644
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,681
<i>HEY-</i>

645
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,970
God, she had the best smile.

646
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:17,681
Yeah, she had the best everything.

647
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,204
It's good to have you
home. Yeah.

648
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,681
I wish you and Cheryl
were getting along better.

649
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,886
Yeah.

650
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,725
Been that way
since we were kids.

651
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:32,010
I don't know, I mean, I guess even in
family sometimes people just don't fit.

652
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,480
You should have seen how I used
to fight with my big brother.

653
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,376
I know you're not trying to make
Mom's sweet potato pie, are you?

654
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,563
There's never been a Meyers
Christmas without it.

655
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,648
And if I'm going to make it,

656
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,571
I'm going to make it right.

657
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,936
<i>The top five in the
draft were supposed to be</i> a <i>lock.</i>

658
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,122
<i>However, now that doctors
have cleared Evan Meyers</i>

659
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,416
<i>to play in
the upcoming bowl game,</i>

660
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,250
<i>that changes everything, everybody.
That changes everything!</i>

661
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,164
<i>He may be naughty, but the
boy's game is real nice.</i>

662
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,004
Poetic injustice, good morning.

663
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,004
Look. It's the accident child
in his natural habitat.

664
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,611
He's unfunny and, therefore,
a liability to the pride.

665
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,965
It's a shame, he won't make it.

666
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,640
I was not an accident.

667
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:21,406
Everyone has their fourth child
in their 50s. That's common.

668
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,376
<i>You better not
shrink from the spotlight.</i>

669
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,209
<i>Merry Christmas, young man.</i>

670
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,766
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>

671
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,561
Hey. Evan.

672
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,045
You locked me out.
What?

673
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,451
You locked me out!

674
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,010
What? I can't hear you.
What happened?

675
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,206
Evan, quit playing.

676
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,362
I am freezing out here,
and I'm in my underwear.

677
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,882
Oh! I'm sorry.
It must have been an accident.

678
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:52,045
Evan. Evan!
I'm melting!

679
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,884
Evan! Evan!

680
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,089
Happy Kwanzaa, Mrs. Olakanday.

681
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,481
Mmm-hmm.

682
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,690
Evan! Evan! Evan!

683
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,481
Okay.

684
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,161
Oh!

685
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,241
No!

686
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,322
Evan, come on. Evan?

687
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:35,450
Come on. Evan? Evan! I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

688
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,091
You're not an accident.
Evan, don't be like this.

689
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,606
Don't be like this.
God does not like ugly, Evan.

690
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,920
Evan, please.

691
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,446
Please, please. Come on!

692
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,407
Twigs. You need some help?

693
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,561
No, I'm fine.

694
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,923
Is there a reason you have a
tattoo that says "sesame chicken"?

695
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,496
It does not say
"sesame chicken," okay?

696
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,560
If you were more cultured,

697
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,720
you would know that it says
"Unbreakable" in Mandarin.

698
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:01,809
Well, I actually took Mandarin
for a semester in college,

699
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,803
I'm pretty sure it says
"sesame chicken."

700
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,291
Stop looking at my ass.

701
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,362
You know what? You're right.

702
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,886
You got it.

703
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,123
I think it says, "Free fortune
cookie with delivery."

704
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,680
Really?

705
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,016
Let me try to get you
out of here.

706
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,202
No! No, no, no.

707
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,656
It's not that kind of party! Okay?
It's not that kind of party.

708
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:23,047
Let me use two hands. I just...
Get from behind me!

709
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,009
No! No!

710
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,047
Get... Get from behind me! No!
Just...

711
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,288
Hold on.
Back up off of my butt!

712
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,723
No! No! No!

713
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,486
There you go.

714
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,164
You okay?
Yeah. I'm good.

715
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,765
What's wrong with you?
I'm good. Okay?

716
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,926
I got it.

717
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,481
You Okay?

718
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,209
Evan, I'm going to kill you!

719
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,129
Phew! Everybody
got everything?

720
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,281
Hey, Mom.
Hey.

721
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,441
Hey, Aunt Rachel.

722
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,124
Look who's up!
How was your morning?

723
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,201
Don't ask.

724
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,805
Hey, baby girl.
Hey.

725
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,365
We got a lot of food.

726
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,930
I see this.

727
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,970
I swear, if I close my eyes,

728
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,924
I can almost see her in here
like it was yesterday.

729
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,401
The thought of having Christmas
dinner without her...

730
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,216
Thought of cooking Christmas
dinner without her...

731
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,129
She was a great cook.

732
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,770
Guess it runs in the family.

733
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,246
You need a cough drop, baby?

734
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,682
It's a shame
we can't find her recipes.

735
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,689
- Where are they?
- Who knows?

736
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,121
She stashed them in a tin
around here somewhere.

737
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,201
That's right.
You know,

738
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,921
I saw her make those recipes a
million times. I should know them.

739
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,200
I just always thought
she'd be here.

740
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,571
She is here.

741
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:43,487
She's in every pot,
in every pan, every cabinet,

742
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,565
and every drawer.

743
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:48,644
We are all standing
on holy ground.

744
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,371
This is the Church of Grace.

745
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:55,724
Y'all didn't hear me?
This is the Church of Grace!

746
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,246
Hallelujah!

747
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,527
In the Church of Grace,
we need music.

748
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,936
Let's get that music, Miss Niya.
Thank you, Jesus!

749
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,960
Let's do it!

750
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,729
Put your music on, Miss Niya.
Here we go.

751
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,490
Let's see what
you gonna work with.

752
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,090
This is not church dancing!

753
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,162
Don't you get down!
Don't you get down!

754
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,761
Come on, Mom.

755
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,161
Give it to 'em.
Show 'em what you got.

756
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,976
All right, Aunt May. Show Aunt
May what you're working with.

757
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,400
What do y'all know
about this stuff?

758
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,530
You got my jam!

759
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,884
Sonya, you better get your
titties off my back, girl,

760
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,769
with your non-dancing ass!

761
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,921
Right here.

762
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,206
Cheryl! Cheryl!
Do our routine!

763
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,045
Wait, let me get my shoes off!

764
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,444
That's it!
Okay, that's enough of that.

765
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,726
We got it.

766
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,365
What? What?

767
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,966
Let Aunt May play
some real music.

768
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,731
Okay, there go mine.
Remember that? Remember that?

769
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,136
Remember, Aunt May taught y'all
that when y'all was little girls?

770
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,003
Remember that? Come on.
What you got?

771
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,962
Bring it back. Bring it back.
Now take it low.

772
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,804
What? What? Now pop that.

773
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,291
All right.
I'm doing second round.

774
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,209
- Come on. Come on.
- Here we go.

775
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,930
Now, take it back. Come on.

776
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,002
Bring it back. Come on.
Pump that.

777
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,801
Remember? Step! Bring it up.

778
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,125
Here it goes!

779
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,486
There it goes!

780
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,210
Now, take it back!

781
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,486
Come on, Aunt May.

782
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,730
Wait, Aunt May,
you been drinking again?

783
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,416
Join us, Pop-pop.
You gotta move it.

784
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,646
Daddy, Daddy!

785
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,087
Come on, Walter.
Bring your old ass in here.

786
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,920
Go, Daddy. Go, Daddy.
Go, Daddy.

787
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,129
Get 'em, Pop! Show 'em!

788
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,449
Push, Lonnie. Dang!

789
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,090
Push with your legs.

790
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,366
Y'all did it.

791
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,489
That's the biggest tree
I've ever seen.

792
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,686
We've had bigger, sweetie.

793
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,807
Yeah!

794
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:00,042
Like the year Mom
let Evan pick the tree.

795
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,363
It was so big we had to saw off the
top just to get it in the house.

796
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,442
What did you do with
the other half you sawed off?

797
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:09,444
We stood it up next to the bigger half.
We had two trees that year.

798
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,965
You're welcome, by the way.

799
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,089
Like your mother always said,
"The bigger the tree..."

800
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,964
"The bigger the love!"

801
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,121
Man.

802
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,081
Yeah.

803
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:28,566
Look here. I'm going to go into the
garage and get the ornaments. Okay?

804
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,721
You need some help, Daddy?

805
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,485
I'm all right, sweetie.
All right.

806
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,296
All right, y'all. Well, let's
bring this thing to life.

807
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,936
Yes. Christian, go get
some water for the tree.

808
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,804
I can't. I gotta go meet
Brooks in town square.

809
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:41,605
Well, the kids would love to go
to town square and meet Santa.

810
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,728
Come on, y'all. Let's do this.
All right, have fun.

811
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,256
All right, Evan, baby. Get a broom
so we can get up these pine needles.

812
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,456
I can't. I told Eric that I'ma
hang with him for a little bit.

813
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,925
But you love
decorating the tree.

814
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,765
I know. But when y'all
mess up, then I get to fix it.

815
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,616
Don't be chasing
them fast-ass girls.

816
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,563
- Nah. Bye, y'all.
- Be careful, baby.

817
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,096
Now, Rachel and Cheryl,
do y'all think

818
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,696
y'all can go in the kitchen
and put something together?

819
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,136
Some snacks,
without killing each other?

820
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,286
Yes.
I appreciate that.

821
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,200
Y'all go on and be
big girls for Aunt May.

822
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:05,961
Depending on y'all.

823
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,496
And, Lonnie, I'm going to need you
to get me the dustpan and the broom

824
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,936
so you can help me
get up these pine needles.

825
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,008
Okay. We'll get 'em up.
Thank you.

826
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:14,441
But let me tell you something.
What?

827
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,602
I love how your hair
just drapes your face.

828
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,364
It just like...

829
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,771
You know, you feathered it.

830
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:23,367
And it's just so nice how it just, you
know, shapes your face real nice.

831
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,496
Thank you, Lonnie. I appreciate that.
Take care of yourself.

832
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,760
Thank you. Yes, indeed.

833
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:31,289
It's like you did a big-ass
peach and a big-ass wig

834
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:34,603
and you put that wig on top of that
peach, and you drape it the same way.

835
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,728
Lonnie, go on, boy.

836
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,256
I don't feel like you right now.
Get you on. All right, all right.

837
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,009
Let me get that broom.
Get on!

838
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,406
<i>Which tree do you think
we should take home, Evan?</i>

839
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:58,720
This one?

840
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:01,566
<i>I want this one, Mommy.</i>

841
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:04,484
<i>Perfect. Just like you.</i>

842
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,010
<i>Feliz Navidad!</i>

843
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,082
What up, fam?
Come on, Santa Claus!

844
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,810
Time to go get
them ho, ho, ho's.

845
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,770
Good to see you, boy. You
always shining like a little...

846
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,490
God damn!
What's that? Soul Glo?

847
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,085
Man, beauty supply store.
Aisle two.

848
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:39,488
I'm up here way too high.
Hang on. There it is.

849
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,329
Hold up. Boy, you ain't cool enough.
What?

850
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,400
Come on, baby. You ain't
going to leave me behind.

851
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,016
Come on, now.
Who do you think taught you?

852
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,610
You ready?
I'm ready. Let's go.

853
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:47,976
Hold on, I'm gonna put
my seat belt on.

854
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,096
Because we all know
you can't drive.

855
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:52,044
Let's get it. You know
what I'm saying?

856
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,536
Okay... Daddy!
Can we go see Santa, Daddy?

857
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:56,561
Huh?

858
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,130
Can we go see Santa?

859
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,201
Santa?

860
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,204
You know, 75% of all sidewalk
Santa's have Hepatitis C.

861
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,362
Don't put your fingers
in his beard.

862
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,807
Thank you for that
very fun fact, Brooks.

863
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,256
Look, baby, soon
as Daddy's done here,

864
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,176
I'm going to take you to do
whatever you want to do, okay?

865
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,690
Like that's going to happen.

866
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,842
Come on. I'll take you. Okay.

867
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,410
He gets that from his mother.

868
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,289
Let's take a walk.

869
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,171
We just lost Van Kirk.
He's supporting Baxter.

870
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,321
What?

871
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:25,130
Our biggest donor
just backed out? Wow.

872
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,241
Politics.

873
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,526
Yeah, so what do we do now?

874
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:30,251
Well, the Brigham Group is
still looking for a way to...

875
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,367
Control our campaign.

876
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,440
No.
Yeah.

877
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:33,561
To support you...
Not me.

878
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,336
Because they believe in
your vision to invest in you.

879
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:38,536
No, what they believe in is that if we win,
they're the first in line for a favor.

880
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,404
Their last favor
downsized a factory!

881
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,364
1,500 people out of work! Their
last candidate is now a senator.

882
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:46,408
Andy Brooks, just, please.

883
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,096
I'm an adult.
Just tell me what they want.

884
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,610
It's not even a done deal yet.

885
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,808
We will talk more about this
after the interview.

886
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,526
What interview?

887
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:57,401
<i>We are here with congressional
candidate Christian Meyers.</i>

888
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,936
<i>New poll numbers show...
Christian's on</i> TV!

889
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,216
<i>- That you really have</i>
a <i>good chance-</i> What?

890
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,416
<i>Yeah, but we will not stop</i>

891
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,800
<i>until the last vote is in.</i>
My <i>gosh!</i>

892
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:06,760
Politics aside, how are you enjoying being
home for the holidays with your family?

893
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,207
Daddy! Daddy!
It's Christian! Hurry!

894
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,527
Hey! That's the tie
I bought him!

895
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:13,920
Move, Cheryl. Move!
Geez Louise!

896
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,456
<i>And the other highlight
is Santa Claus.</i>

897
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:17,369
<i>Have you had a chance
to sit on his lap yet?</i>

898
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,840
<i>No, I'm leaving that up
to the kids.</i>

899
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,283
If you did sit on Santa's lap,

900
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:23,656
I'm sure everyone at home would love
to know what you would ask for.

901
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,409
Ask for a suit that fits.

902
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,456
Because he going to mess around
and get a yeast infection.

903
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,496
May! And that cream
don't work on men, Cheryl.

904
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,931
You used to keep
a yeast infection.

905
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,331
Aunt May!
That itching, burning...

906
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,129
It didn't do good for you.

907
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,487
They ain't Instagram
models, but they a'ight.

908
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,096
'Cause anytime you ask them to do
something, they gonna be like, "A'ight."

909
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:41,376
Put some gas in the car. "A'ight."
Pour my bath water. "A'ight."

910
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,084
I don't even take baths.
I take showers.

911
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,161
What can I get for you?

912
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,361
Everything.

913
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,889
Can I get
the chili cheese bacon burger?

914
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,411
And can I get some fries?

915
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:50,936
And can you please tell them
to make it crispy.

916
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,656
I need to hear the
when I eat. You know what I'm saying?

917
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,887
And can I get a milkshake?

918
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,527
With extra whipped cream.

919
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,216
Because last time,
they forgot my whipped cream.

920
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:00,896
So I'm going to need
my last time whipped cream

921
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,922
and this time whipped cream,
and some apple pie.

922
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,490
Can I just get a chicken breast,

923
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,376
side of asparagus,
and some brown rice, please?

924
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,526
Absolutely.

925
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,289
Everything's coming right up, baby.
Okay.

926
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,169
All right, baby.
You got mine? Baby?

927
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:14,687
Baby, baby, baby! I heard you
1 O times already. Okay!

928
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,016
Obviously you didn't.
A bag of sugar.

929
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,336
<i>A</i> bag of sugar.
Two sticks of butter.

930
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:18,816
<i>Two sticks of butter.
And some vanilla extract.</i>

931
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,080
<i>Don't forget, Lonnie.</i>

932
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:22,136
<i>And the vanilla wafers, and
bananas...</i> I'ma call <i>you</i> back.

933
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,889
Call you back!

934
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:25,320
Let me give you
a hand with that.

935
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:26,761
Oh! See that?

936
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:29,969
I'm used to putting my hands up like that.
Crashing the boards.

937
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:32,850
I know a little bit
about boxing out, myself.

938
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,843
Okay. You play basketball?

939
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,206
I did.

940
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:37,884
I did. What about you?

941
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,085
You know, a little bit.

942
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,481
Who hasn't?

943
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:44,971
Lonnie Maclay?

944
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:50,727
My dad is a huge
Seattle SuperSonics fan.

945
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:51,847
Wow.

946
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,161
I remember game four,

947
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:57,285
1991, game-winning shot.

948
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:59,966
You remember?
You saw that game?

949
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:01,565
Did I?

950
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:04,041
We wore green
for like a week straight!

951
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:05,963
Wow.
Shatao!

952
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:08,963
Don't tell me you know
about "shatao."

953
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,407
I know all about "shatao."

954
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,241
Wow.

955
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:17,326
I don't think anyone's going to
believe that I actually met you.

956
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,164
Would you mind
if I take a selfie?

957
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:22,244
If you know about "shatao," you can
take as many photos <i>as</i> you want.

958
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,321
Okay.

959
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,128
Love that!
Can we take another?

960
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,326
Funny face.
Okay.

961
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,129
All right, you ready? Okay.
Mmm-hmm.

962
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,162
Love that!
Let me see.

963
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,765
That's great!
Right?

964
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:44,081
You know what? I would love
a copy of that picture.

965
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,446
Yeah.

966
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,216
You want to put
your number in my phone?

967
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:48,616
And I'll just send it
to you when I get off?

968
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,802
Okay, I'll put my number.
Okay, put it in.

969
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,370
My number in here.

970
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:56,288
I would love to put
this photo on my fan wall.

971
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,761
Especially someone
as beautiful as you.

972
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:00,681
That's me.

973
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:03,361
I got it.

974
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:05,685
So, I'll send it.

975
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,364
You better send it.

976
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:08,521
I will.

977
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:11,127
But you're not going
to get me fired. Okay.

978
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,924
It's a pleasure
meeting you, Lonnie.

979
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,136
<i>Attention, all shoppers.</i>

980
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:18,243
<i>Special holiday savings today
with your Clubs Card.</i>

981
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:20,322
Pleasure's all mine.

982
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,166
Twigs!

983
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,686
Twigs! Hold up!

984
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,200
Cool!

985
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,203
Workout partner for the week.

986
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:32,131
I missed the last three days.
Had to double up.

987
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:33,440
How far do you usually run?

988
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,727
A lot farther when people
aren't talking to me.

989
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,565
Me, I love the company.
Helps the time go by.

990
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:40,409
I don't. It distracts me.

991
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,641
Girl, I swear, you haven't
changed one bit.

992
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,561
Except for this jogging thing.

993
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,085
Looks good on you.

994
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,924
And neighborhood's looking good.

995
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,480
I gotta say, your pops did a real
good job fixing up the house.

996
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:57,848
Okay, what part of "it's
distracting" don't you understand?

997
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,806
Probably the same part of
"there's a cicada in your hair"

998
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:03,325
that you don't understand.

999
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:07,809
Get it! Get it! Get it!

1000
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,041
Have a good rest of the day.

1001
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:10,167
Get it! Get it! Get it!

1002
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,570
Get it Off!

1003
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,443
Did you find everything
you need?

1004
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:25,007
Sometimes you find things that
you're not even looking for.

1005
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:27,121
Crazy.

1006
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:30,045
I seen your interview, E.

1007
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:31,167
What interview?

1008
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:32,321
The one on ESPN.

1009
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,280
They said your shoulder
was good. You all right?

1010
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,771
Yeah.

1011
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:38,171
Coach is...

1012
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:41,483
He's trying to get me to stay on these
pills for like another week or two.

1013
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:45,165
I just forgot to get my
prescription filled before I left.

1014
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:46,496
You think your boy
can get me some?

1015
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:48,443
Who? Lil' Discount?
Mmm-hmm.

1016
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:49,567
Man. He good.

1017
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:52,530
Got your suits, pills,
negative pregnancy results.

1018
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,642
Listen, the baby is not yours.

1019
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,924
Ask him if he can get these.

1020
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:03,091
My man can do it all, bro.
I got you.

1021
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:04,400
I'ma to talk to him for you.

1022
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,561
Thanks, man.

1023
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:07,326
Oh, God.

1024
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,086
I found her!

1025
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:14,724
Hey!
Hey.

1026
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,371
Who's Munchie?

1027
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,164
His name is Malachi, and we used
to be friends in high school.

1028
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,200
Then why didn't you let him
help us with the bags?

1029
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,891
Because first they help you
with your bags

1030
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:37,376
and next thing you know, they're
taking somebody else to prom.

1031
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:40,131
Mom, can I tell you something?

1032
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,765
And not get in trouble for it?

1033
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:43,521
What?

1034
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,370
Am I going to get in trouble?

1035
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:46,441
Probably.

1036
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,450
You're an attractive woman.

1037
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:52,161
You have a lot to offer a guy but
you gotta stop running them off.

1038
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:53,616
I'm not running anybody off.

1039
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:54,687
Really?

1040
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,446
Remember my gym teacher, Mr.
Harrison? Yeah.

1041
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,761
He said you were beautiful.
He said he loved your hair.

1042
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:02,764
And you said, "So if I was bald,
I wouldn't be beautiful?"

1043
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:07,164
No. See, I just don't think a woman's
beauty should be defined by her hair.

1044
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:08,730
Well, what about
the gas station?

1045
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,136
It was storming, and that really
cute guy asked to pump our gas.

1046
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:12,525
And I let him.

1047
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:13,681
Well, yeah.

1048
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,808
Until he hit regular unleaded,
and you said,

1049
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:18,451
"So a black woman
can't afford premium?"

1050
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:19,520
Exactly.

1051
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:22,450
You had to pump your gas in the
rain while it ruined your hair.

1052
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:24,249
I was getting my hair done
the next day.

1053
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:26,766
Mom, you're missing the point.

1054
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,410
Men aren't that smart.

1055
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,840
So we have to trick them into
thinking things are their idea

1056
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,006
when it's really ours.

1057
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:33,136
Like Brandon, my boyfriend.

1058
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:34,241
I'm sorry.

1059
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:36,921
You have a boyfriend?

1060
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,126
Mom, stay focused.

1061
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:39,656
I don't like carrying
my bag all the time.

1062
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,921
So when Brandon's around, I
act like it hurts my shoulder

1063
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,240
and he carries it for me.

1064
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:45,376
He gets to be a hero, and I
don't have to carry my bag.

1065
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:46,560
When did you get a boyfriend?

1066
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:48,285
Focus, Mom.

1067
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,001
Trust me.

1068
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:53,801
Life's a whole lot easier when there's
someone to help carry the load.

1069
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,608
Even if you can
carry it yourself.

1070
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:07,136
People want jobs, and
small businesses want capital.

1071
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:09,056
It's not enough to create
centers for small businesses.

1072
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:10,844
We have to pool...

1073
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:13,651
We have to cultivate resources.

1074
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:16,491
Pop. Hey, morning! Morning!
Morning!

1075
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,256
I'm gonna whip up some pancakes here.
You want some?

1076
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:21,648
No, I'm trying to lay off them
processed carbs right now.

1077
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:23,246
Yeah.

1078
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,642
I cannot tell you how excited we
were watching you on TV yesterday.

1079
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:35,008
You know, it's not often

1080
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:42,044
the son of an old mechanic becomes
a United States congressman.

1081
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:44,885
You own six auto shops, Pop.

1082
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,803
And I do have
to win the election first.

1083
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,644
It's only a formality.

1084
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,164
Hey, your mother...

1085
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:58,645
She would have turned this whole house
into your campaign headquarters.

1086
00:53:58,720 --> 00:53:59,846
Yep-

1087
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,768
She'd have been so proud of you.

1088
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,450
You know, maybe you can say a few
words at the shelter this year.

1089
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:11,568
I mean, hearing
from a future congressman

1090
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:15,209
would make the year
even more special.

1091
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:20,171
I'd love to.

1092
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,161
Hey!

1093
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,844
Oh! Buddy.

1094
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:29,688
You ain't worried about me
embarrassing you?

1095
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:33,211
Whoo! Here we go.

1096
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:36,568
I thought we supposed
to be playing some football.

1097
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:38,489
Come on, old man. Let's go!

1098
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:41,523
Who you talking to?

1099
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,841
Hey. Come on, old man.

1100
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:45,681
Hut! Hike!

1101
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:49,041
Here I come!

1102
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,450
Get him, son. Get him!

1103
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,885
This is great.
Quality family time.

1104
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:58,486
A beautiful day. Beautiful day.
Yes, it is.

1105
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:00,130
They gonna kill
each other out there.

1106
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:03,884
- Block!
- Look at the old man!

1107
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:06,490
Here! Right here!
Throw the ball!

1108
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:08,056
- Lonnie, heads up!
- Nice catch, Lonnie.

1109
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:10,162
That's how
they did it in Croatia.

1110
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,129
What's up with those
pink pants, Malibu Barbie?

1111
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:13,576
I left mine at home.
These are Cheryl's.

1112
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,329
Yeah. No, we all believe that.

1113
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:20,801
I'm down.

1114
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:22,081
First down for me.
It's touch!

1115
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:24,288
Get off my sister, man.
I got you.

1116
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:25,686
I was down, Lonnie!

1117
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:31,570
Cheryl, that's how you do it.

1118
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:34,001
Whoo!
What are y'all doing?

1119
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:37,050
I taught you that!
I taught you that, baby.

1120
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:38,804
We got skills over here.

1121
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:40,680
Hey, Aunt May.

1122
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:43,607
That's for you, baby.
She don't want you!

1123
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,162
Uh-oh!
Somebody got a boyfriend!

1124
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:49,489
They'd make an excellent couple.

1125
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,609
I got vibrators
older than that child.

1126
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:57,128
Go, baby! Go, baby!

1127
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:58,725
Rachel, stop trying to pump him.

1128
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,882
What's all this freaking
going on? Come on!

1129
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:02,570
What are you doing?

1130
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,529
Cameron, don't you want to play?

1131
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:07,604
Is it better to be
on the team or own it?

1132
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:11,121
Where's the flag?

1133
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,576
Get your ass up, boy.
Come on. Get up, boy.

1134
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:13,931
Come on, Ev.
Damn!

1135
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:20,127
'Got it!

1136
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:21,247
What was that, Lonnie?

1137
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:22,810
Evan! Evan! Don't!

1138
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:24,856
What the hell was that? You tripped him!
What are you doing?

1139
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,006
Lonnie, don't!

1140
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,603
World Star!

1141
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,569
Lonnie, have you lost your damn mind?
Lonnie!

1142
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,120
- Lonnie!
- Wait a minute!

1143
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,040
Man, you saw where I was going!

1144
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:35,570
You gonna try to trip me?
Stop it!

1145
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:37,085
You had to trip him?

1146
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:38,571
That's his career!

1147
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,369
Not your dumb, made up one!

1148
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,616
Really?
What's that, right there?

1149
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:43,244
What is that?
Everyone knows

1150
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:45,527
you go overseas when you
don't make it in the NBA.

1151
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:46,886
You're a joke!

1152
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:49,566
Oh. At least he had a career,
Miss Teacher-Veterinarian.

1153
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:50,766
Or is it attorney now?

1154
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:52,888
Which, given the salary
of a divorced, single mom

1155
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:55,088
working graveyard shifts
at the Waffle House,

1156
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:57,003
will take till 2050 to afford.

1157
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,764
Rachel, Cheryl! Okay.

1158
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:01,971
Okay, game's over!
Game's over.

1159
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:04,845
Good game! Good game!
Good game! Yeah!

1160
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:06,604
Good game. Let's go get...

1161
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:08,444
Let's go get dinner. Okay?

1162
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:10,522
As long as
it's not Waffle House.

1163
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,250
The hell is wrong with him?

1164
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:17,923
Go ahead. I got the baby.
Come on, babies.

1165
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,684
I got y'all. Come on. Come on.

1166
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:25,691
We were doing so well.

1167
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,045
You were great, Mom.

1168
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:42,442
Yeah, man. I'm all right.
I almost whooped that...

1169
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:44,642
We almost whooped his ass.

1170
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:46,006
Yo, you got that
for me, or what?

1171
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:47,605
Yeah, I got it.

1172
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:50,201
Yes!

1173
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:51,924
Damn, man!
I didn't need this many!

1174
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:53,883
No, a couple of 'em SweeTARTS.

1175
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:58,976
Come on, Christian.
Just hear me out.

1176
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,129
This is exactly why I said I didn't
want them to back my campaign!

1177
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:04,965
They just blow into town and start
steamrolling over small businesses.

1178
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:07,840
No, they blow into town, and they
turn state senators into congressmen.

1179
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:10,281
This is not good!
I can't do this!

1180
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:11,576
I think you're
over thinking this.

1181
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:12,656
They're just going
to go downtown.

1182
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:15,176
They're going to turn some old, shitty
buildings into beautiful lofts.

1183
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,964
What's the problem?
My mom.

1184
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:20,011
The homeless shelter
is in the district.

1185
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,684
It meant a lot to my mom.

1186
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:26,681
Look, after you're elected,

1187
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:28,416
you're going to rebuild
that homeless shelter.

1188
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:31,046
And it's going to be beautiful.
Your mother would love it.

1189
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:32,963
Andy Brooks,

1190
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:35,884
no announcement
until after the holidays.

1191
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:41,921
Fine.

1192
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:51,965
Hey, Lonnie.

1193
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:54,963
Can I get some help in the back?

1194
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:48,011
Hmm!

1195
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:50,010
No, you didn't.

1196
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:53,241
Ooh!

1197
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:56,000
Sorry.

1198
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:02,081
Rachel.

1199
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:04,206
Rachel Meyers.

1200
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:05,600
Do we know each other?

1201
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:08,722
Jasmine.
Chloe's little sister.

1202
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:10,729
From high school.

1203
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:12,848
Yeah, right!
Right. How is she?

1204
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:15,531
She's good. She's coaching
women's basketball at Kansas.

1205
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:16,840
Nice!
Yeah.

1206
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:19,127
Wow! You look the same.

1207
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,009
Like no time passed.

1208
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:22,167
How have you been?

1209
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:26,370
Seem to be blowing up
over there.

1210
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,041
Boyfriend?

1211
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:29,201
Um...

1212
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:34,171
He just invited me to Chicago
for the weekend.

1213
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:37,124
Must be nice.
$8.49.

1214
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:39,731
He can't get enough of you.

1215
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,525
Do you mind?

1216
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,011
He's so cute.

1217
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:45,929
Look how perfect
we are together.

1218
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:47,726
Shit.

1219
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:49,404
That's what I said.

1220
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:51,886
Want to see another?

1221
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,411
Um... Oh!

1222
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:57,610
Yeah. Confirmation
of your love.

1223
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:02,046
I was hoping I wouldn't have
to spend Christmas alone.

1224
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:04,000
But he's got to take care
of his Grandma Cheryl.

1225
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:06,441
She's really old.

1226
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:09,841
Yeah.

1227
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:13,449
I had an old
Grandma Cheryl once.

1228
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:15,443
She was a mean, old bitch.

1229
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:20,207
You said you were going
to be alone on Christmas?

1230
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,331
Yeah.

1231
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:23,890
You don't have to be.

1232
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:26,610
I don't?
Nope.

1233
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:30,041
Our family has
so much love to give.

1234
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:32,525
Obviously.

1235
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:33,965
That's what's up.

1236
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:10,920
Some game, huh?

1237
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:14,401
Yeah.

1238
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:16,562
Hey, don't worry
about what your sister said.

1239
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:17,721
Being single isn't bad.

1240
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:19,040
Thanks. Feel a lot better.

1241
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:20,527
What is wrong with you?

1242
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:22,441
You know, nothing.

1243
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:26,923
Except that you keep trying to act
like we're cool when we're not.

1244
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:29,569
Why aren't we cool?
Really?

1245
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:33,925
Belinda "Big teeth"?

1246
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,047
Who?

1247
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:37,521
Your prom date? Horse face?

1248
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:40,881
Her teeth weren't really that big.
She had a small mouth.

1249
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:42,896
And, okay, I took her to the prom.
What's the big problem?

1250
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:44,496
You took her to the prom!
That's the problem.

1251
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:46,409
After you canceled on me
at the last minute.

1252
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:47,970
Like you even wanted
to go with me!

1253
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:49,724
Why do you think
I asked you to go?

1254
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:54,686
I heard him.

1255
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:56,610
Heard who?
Your dumb jock friend.

1256
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:59,968
He was laughing about how easy it would
be for the star basketball player

1257
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:02,964
to take his nerdy next-door
neighbor to bed that night.

1258
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:05,281
I heard him. And you just
let him talk about me.

1259
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:07,203
You didn't say anything!

1260
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:11,246
You're right. I didn't.

1261
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:15,243
And neither did he
after I broke his nose.

1262
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:18,884
That's how Damien
broke his nose?

1263
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:21,804
You would have known if you weren't
such a dramatic little princess.

1264
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:25,009
You would have known why I canceled
if you weren't such a dumb jock.

1265
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:26,176
Wouldn't have mattered anyway

1266
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:29,200
'cause there wouldn't have been enough
room in the limo for the three of us.

1267
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:30,480
The three of us?
Yeah.

1268
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:31,971
Me, you, and your ego.

1269
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:34,129
Oh. We'd have fit.

1270
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:36,800
Because your low self-esteem doesn't
take up too much real estate.

1271
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:41,530
You know what?
I'm glad we didn't go.

1272
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:44,001
That makes two of us. It
would've been a terrible night.

1273
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:45,161
Worst prom ever.

1274
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:47,163
Absolute worst!

1275
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:04,409
It would have been
a horrible night.

1276
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:05,881
Awful.

1277
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:29,121
Ooh!

1278
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:33,560
Okay. Here.

1279
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:38,127
Aunt May, I gotta go
to the bathroom.

1280
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:41,170
Hold it. Aunt May
is in concert, baby.

1281
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:43,720
You don't interrupt
Aunt May's concerts.

1282
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:47,362
Just hold it
a little longer, Cam.

1283
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:49,565
Is Cameron all right?

1284
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:51,802
That food is still running
through him.

1285
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:06,002
<i>Heaven and nature sing</i>

1286
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:09,891
<i>Heaven and nature sing</i>

1287
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:19,050
I've been sipping!

1288
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:20,525
This is good to me.

1289
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:22,601
Ah!

1290
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:24,927
Come on.

1291
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,048
It's getting me up
outta my seat!

1292
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:29,680
You feel that?

1293
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:32,161
You sound beautiful, Aunt May.

1294
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:34,448
I'm gonna go ahead
and let Cameron sip some.

1295
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:36,091
Hell no.

1296
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:55,001
Double the temperature,

1297
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:56,891
half the time.

1298
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:58,087
Boom!

1299
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,362
<i>You've got to finish strong, baby.</i>

1300
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:15,616
<i>I haven't even done
my small business speech yet.</i>

1301
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:17,244
That's our "Yes, We Can" speech.

1302
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:19,656
I don't know what's in that
speech, but just keep saying it

1303
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:21,364
because you're now
the growth candidate.

1304
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:23,807
That means
that you are going to be...

1305
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:24,927
What the hell is this?

1306
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:33,896
The rezoning's going to happen
with or without me, Pop.

1307
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:35,736
They don't need my support.
Our prime purpose in life...

1308
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,976
If I plan to get into office, I
need theirs... is to help others.

1309
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,056
If you can't help them, at the
very least, don't hurt them.

1310
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:42,216
But if I do not get elected into
office, how can I help, Pop?

1311
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:44,447
Great progress
requires great sacrifice.

1312
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:46,085
Did you come up
with that yourself?

1313
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:48,003
Or did your campaign manager
write it for you?

1314
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:51,129
People figure it out, Pop.
They always figure it out.

1315
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,885
Your mother was seven years
old when your aunt was born.

1316
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:55,096
Pop, please don't bring
Mom into this.

1317
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:57,009
Your grandparents
were having a tough time

1318
01:06:57,080 --> 01:07:00,971
and having another mouth to
feed didn't make it any easier.

1319
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:04,248
They ended up losing their home.

1320
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,050
And moving into a shelter.

1321
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:08,765
That shelter.

1322
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:12,281
That's why it was
so important to her.

1323
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:17,201
So the next time you talk
about people figuring it out,

1324
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:21,641
remember, one of those people
was your mother.

1325
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:37,886
Oh, my God!

1326
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:39,200
What the hell?

1327
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:44,449
My macaroni and cheese!

1328
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:46,887
It was going to be disgusting.
I did you a favor.

1329
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,571
Well, then do me a damn favor.
Don't burn down the damn house!

1330
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:50,687
'Got it!

1331
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:51,886
Damn!
Lonnie!

1332
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:55,721
I'm sorry, Aunt May.

1333
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:57,564
What the hell did you all do?

1334
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:59,336
And you done sprayed some shit
on me, Lonnie?

1335
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:01,408
I ought to whip your ass.
You raise your goddamn...

1336
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:02,686
Shut up!

1337
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:05,406
You can't afford to buy me
no more outfits like this.

1338
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:06,726
This my damn Chaka Khan.

1339
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:08,325
Chaka Khan. Chaka Khan!

1340
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:15,647
Five days.

1341
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:18,528
I knew it was going to be tough.

1342
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:22,847
But I said, "Surely the
children she loved so much

1343
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:25,446
"and damn near gave her life for

1344
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:28,604
"would find a way
to make it work."

1345
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:32,564
Obviously, I was wrong.

1346
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:36,165
And disappointed.

1347
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:40,926
I expect you all
will clean this up.

1348
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:48,445
I'll tell you what. I'll be the better
man between the both of us. Okay?

1349
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:49,846
I'm sorry.

1350
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:52,040
You going to be the better man
between the both of us?

1351
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:56,923
There! Messed up
my damn Chaka Khan wig.

1352
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:59,176
You see what happened just now?
Do you see what happened?

1353
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:00,536
You don't do that to a man!

1354
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:02,496
That wasn't no man I did it to.
Here, you take this rag.

1355
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:04,536
You old big-lipped son of a bitch.
You take that one.

1356
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:05,607
Good luck.

1357
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:07,444
No. Don't even try, Christian.

1358
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:09,856
I'm not the one who tried to
deep-fry the whole kitchen, am I?

1359
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:12,850
No. And I don't think I was making the
blackeroni and cheese over there.

1360
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:14,530
So I think we should just go.

1361
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:16,056
You want some pizza
and wings or something?

1362
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:17,376
You know I gotta watch
my carbs, right?

1363
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:18,447
That's fine.

1364
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:20,576
They got that high school cheerleader
menu you can order from.

1365
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:21,840
Shut up, dude.

1366
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:23,160
It's all good.
Right?

1367
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:42,730
Okay, I'm done.

1368
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:44,081
Great!

1369
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:48,366
So now, I can remake
the macaroni you ruined.

1370
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:51,091
No. I'm going to make
the dressing you ruined.

1371
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:54,249
Rachel, you're being ridiculous.
No. I need to get my stuff.

1372
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:55,845
Rachel, stop.
You always do this.

1373
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:57,166
I need all this.

1374
01:09:57,240 --> 01:09:58,526
Why are you taking my stuff?

1375
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:00,602
I need the noodles.
No.I need...

1376
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:04,485
Oh, my God.

1377
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:06,161
Oh.

1378
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:45,406
Mom's fried chicken.

1379
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:48,324
"Always use
a cast iron skillet."

1380
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:50,816
That's why mine
never turned out right.

1381
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:52,285
Yeah, she did.

1382
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,764
Buttermilk biscuits.

1383
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:58,844
Christian would kill for this.

1384
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,002
And Brooks would kill us.

1385
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:02,764
Let's give it to him.

1386
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:04,171
Carbs!

1387
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:10,488
Her collard green recipe.

1388
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:13,291
Smoked turkey necks,
half a cup of sugar,

1389
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:15,283
and a pinch of bugs.
Bugs.

1390
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:20,326
So amazing.

1391
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:22,244
Did you find
the sweet potato pie recipe?

1392
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:26,370
Oh, God. Mom made it so often I
don't even think she wrote it down.

1393
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:29,769
Look at this.
Wow.

1394
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:32,321
Aw!

1395
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:50,726
I think I'm going
to go outside for a minute.

1396
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:08,006
<i>What's up? It's your girl,
Jazz. Leave a message.</i>

1397
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:10,850
Hey, Jasmine. It's Rachel.

1398
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:14,925
Look, I made a mistake
in inviting you to dinner.

1399
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,490
And I'm really sorry.

1400
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:19,171
And I hope it doesn't totally
screw up your whole day.

1401
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:22,011
Merry Christmas.

1402
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:38,728
There's maybe
more sugar, butter.

1403
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:41,565
It looks like Grace's.

1404
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:46,044
Will it taste like it?
Let's see.

1405
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:54,170
What are you doing here?

1406
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:57,323
Me and bunny were elected
to tell you that

1407
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:59,129
everyone is really sorry.

1408
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:02,284
They say you wouldn't be mad
at me 'cause I'm too cute.

1409
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:04,165
And they are right.

1410
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:07,049
You all ready for Santa?

1411
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:08,121
Am I'.>

1412
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:11,170
I get to see all my presents,
and eat all the dessert I want,

1413
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:13,567
and not get in trouble.

1414
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:17,167
And Nana's sweet potato pie
is my favorite.

1415
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:19,364
Mine too.

1416
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:22,410
I just hope my version
doesn't disappoint everyone.

1417
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:25,243
So far, it hasn't been
going that good.

1418
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:27,243
Are you smiling
when you make it?

1419
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:30,531
When Nana cooked,
she always smiled.

1420
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:32,489
You haven't smiled a lot,
Pop-pop.

1421
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:34,005
When I get sad,

1422
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:37,368
I just think about all the
things that make me happy.

1423
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:38,680
And then I smile.

1424
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:42,089
Maybe you should try it.

1425
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:47,564
Maybe I will.

1426
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:06,641
Hot!

1427
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:17,685
What do you think, love?

1428
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:32,051
Eggs.

1429
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:41,729
Just a little bit of cinnamon.
Now, remember that. Little bit.

1430
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:44,770
Sweet vanilla.

1431
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:47,091
All right?

1432
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:48,491
And nutmeg.

1433
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:50,361
That's the bomb.

1434
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:55,801
I can't remember how much milk
you put in this.

1435
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:57,687
Uh-huh.

1436
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:01,606
Yeah.

1437
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:34,808
Hey, yo, Pops.
Santa came early.

1438
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:47,806
Oh, man.

1439
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:31,009
You want some
sweet potatoes, baby?

1440
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:32,921
30. Daddy?
Hmm?

1441
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,120
How do you like the cranberry salad?
Pretty good, huh?

1442
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:36,207
Very good.

1443
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:38,968
I made the stuffing.
Do you like it?

1444
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:40,883
Tasty.
Cheryl, would you like some?

1445
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:45,169
Yes. I would, Rachel.

1446
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:46,685
That's very nice of y'all.

1447
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:48,603
There you go.
I'm going to be a copycat.

1448
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:50,170
Thank you.
I want some stuffing too.

1449
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:52,561
You can't get
enough stuffing, can you?

1450
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:54,085
Sure can't.

1451
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:55,367
Let me get that.

1452
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:57,289
Do you want some stuffing, baby?

1453
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:00,442
Boy, I'm a grown-ass woman.

1454
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:02,336
Cameron, you mind passing me
the green beans, please?

1455
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:03,521
Don't eat too much.

1456
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:05,762
We should save some for
the shelter. Right, Granddad?

1457
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:07,080
That's right, buddy.

1458
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:08,446
This is really delicious.

1459
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:11,484
Listen, if I promise not to cook,
can we do it again tomorrow?

1460
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:16,082
Oh. Careful. Watch the floors
there, Cam.

1461
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:18,481
Never know when
we gotta resell. Right, Pops?

1462
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:21,160
Right.

1463
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:24,369
If you want to get scratches out of
wood floors, here's a little trick.

1464
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:27,284
You get some shoe polish
and some Crisco oil.

1465
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:28,646
Get a pair of old underwear.

1466
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:31,451
Wrap the old underwear around
your hand, nice and tight,

1467
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,525
and you buff it out.

1468
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:36,410
Put a little muscle to it.
Buff it out real good.

1469
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,136
I'm sure you got a pair of old
underwear lying around, Walter.

1470
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:40,810
Little trick I learned
over in Croatia.

1471
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:42,521
Listen.

1472
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:46,130
I'ma stab your ass with this fork.
Do you hear me?

1473
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:47,361
I would love that.

1474
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:48,601
Evan.

1475
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:51,896
What's going on with you? You've
been moping around all day.

1476
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:53,680
Nothing, yo. I guess
I just lost my appetite.

1477
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:55,080
Well, that's never
happened before.

1478
01:17:56,120 --> 01:17:57,680
I love the new paint
on the porch, Pops.

1479
01:17:58,440 --> 01:17:59,680
Evan, we were talking to you.

1480
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:00,886
And the hedges.

1481
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:03,806
You've been meaning to clean those
up for a while now. It's nice.

1482
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:06,566
I guess you finally
got around to it now, huh?

1483
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:10,481
Yeah.

1484
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:12,561
I guess I did.

1485
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:17,766
You know they have these new
fiberglass gutters, right?

1486
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:19,928
- Lonnie, shut your ass up.
- Lonnie, please.

1487
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:21,486
Now, damn!

1488
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:24,040
Evan, baby,
what you talking about?

1489
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:26,889
What am I talking about?

1490
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:32,284
Tell 'em, Dad. Tell everybody
what it is I'm talking about.

1491
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:33,960
Wait a minute.
What the hell is going on?

1492
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:38,280
Dad, you're selling the house?

1493
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:40,842
No. You're joking, right?

1494
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:44,642
You did this without
saying anything to us?

1495
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:46,376
Cheryl, give that to me.
That's not what that is.

1496
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:48,209
Let me see this.

1497
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:50,408
Come on now, Walter.

1498
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:51,776
You know you should've
said something to somebody.

1499
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:54,096
Pop, Mom would have
spoken to everyone in this house

1500
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:55,600
before she made
that kind of decision.

1501
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:57,376
Mom wouldn't even think
about selling the house.

1502
01:18:57,400 --> 01:18:58,526
This is the family home.

1503
01:18:58,600 --> 01:18:59,761
It's my house.

1504
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:01,976
Let me tell y'all something.
I understand...

1505
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,525
We're just a little confused.

1506
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:05,204
It's really sudden, Dad.

1507
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:07,201
It's my house.

1508
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:08,816
Why would you
even consider that?

1509
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:11,002
It's my house!

1510
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:21,169
I'm supposed to ask your
permission to sell my house?

1511
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:24,124
Evan, baby. Get him.

1512
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:25,361
Evan!

1513
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:26,566
Evan, come back!

1514
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:45,288
Well, at least we know
it can't get any worse.

1515
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:48,806
I'll get it.

1516
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:02,327
Hey, everybody,
there's a lady named Jasmine.

1517
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:04,010
She says
she's Aunt Rachel's friend.

1518
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:15,647
Hey!

1519
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:16,881
Hey!
What are you doing here?

1520
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:18,485
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas!

1521
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:19,686
You invited me.

1522
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:21,967
I did. Did you not
get my message?

1523
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:23,246
No. Oh.

1524
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:24,561
Um...

1525
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:27,680
I never check my voicemails.
I'm a texter.

1526
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:30,804
What was it?
Am I not supposed...

1527
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:31,880
No. No.

1528
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:34,002
I just wanted to make sure
you brought something.

1529
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:35,969
And you did!
You're a mind reader.

1530
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:37,121
This is great.

1531
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:38,201
Jasmine,

1532
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:40,127
this is my family.

1533
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:41,201
Family, this is Jasmine.

1534
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:42,611
Okay, we have names.

1535
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:46,090
That's sister, father,
brother, sister-in-law, child.

1536
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:47,360
Nice to meet you all.

1537
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:50,240
- You can sit right here.
- Welcome.

1538
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:52,486
Why would you do that?

1539
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:53,936
Why would I do that?
Why would you do that?

1540
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:55,376
What are you trying to do?
Break up a happy home?

1541
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:56,576
Obviously, it's not that happy

1542
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:58,720
if you are banging the cashier
from the Piggly Wiggly.

1543
01:20:58,760 --> 01:21:02,731
You invited her to Christmas
dinner with your sister.

1544
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:06,202
Who does that?

1545
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:07,361
Who does what?

1546
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:11,570
Who puts paprika
in potato salad?

1547
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:13,608
Who does that?

1548
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:15,563
Everybody.
Not my family.

1549
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:18,684
We don't put paprika on potato salad.
We just don't do that.

1550
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:21,001
Okay, Lonnie, you're being
ridiculous. Come on.

1551
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:22,496
I'm talking to your sister
about the potato salad.

1552
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:24,216
Okay, we're in the middle
of Christmas dinner.

1553
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:25,685
You can talk to her later.
Okay.

1554
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:27,364
Come on now. Come on.

1555
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:29,726
Help me!

1556
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:33,647
Okay. You like
them brownies, don't you?

1557
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:35,609
This must be a special recipe.

1558
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:43,641
I love your home, by the way.

1559
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:45,006
Yeah? Thank you.

1560
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:46,286
It's so beautiful.

1561
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:47,696
I really think
you should. They're very good.

1562
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:48,736
I already had 'em, baby.

1563
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:49,807
Really pretty.

1564
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:57,130
I love your family.

1565
01:21:57,200 --> 01:21:58,326
Thank you.

1566
01:21:58,400 --> 01:21:59,686
I still have some.

1567
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:01,922
That's okay.
That's okay.

1568
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,490
Yeah, they are good.

1569
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:15,841
Is there any more dressing?

1570
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:18,969
No dressing on this table.
I'm going to go grab some.

1571
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:20,166
Lonnie, sit down.

1572
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:23,046
Lonnie?

1573
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:25,403
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.

1574
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,570
What are you doing here?

1575
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,365
Rachel, you know Lonnie.

1576
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:33,049
I'd love some ham. Thank you.

1577
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:34,121
Some ham?

1578
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:37,568
How about I just stick a slice
at a time in your mouth?

1579
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:40,761
You were trying to surprise me.

1580
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:45,206
That is so sweet.

1581
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:47,283
So, you two know each other?

1582
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:52,405
Yeah, well, when you called me
from the supermarket

1583
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:55,165
when I was getting those ingredients
for the banana pudding.

1584
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:57,521
Bananas, the vanilla,
the vanilla wafers.

1585
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:00,649
It's not every day around here you
run into a professional athlete

1586
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:04,122
who invites you to spend
a weekend in Chicago.

1587
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,056
- What is going on?
- And you definitely don%run

1588
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:11,687
into people nice enough to invite you
to such a beautiful Christmas dinner.

1589
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:18,241
So, Rachel knew that you knew Lonnie
when she invited you to our dinner?

1590
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:19,361
Mmm-hmm.

1591
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:22,688
I got a little toothache here.

1592
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:23,807
Orajel.

1593
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:25,166
You were saying?

1594
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:26,287
Well...

1595
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:28,931
See, she recognized him
from one of our pictures.

1596
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,001
Oh!

1597
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:32,004
There's pictures!

1598
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:33,127
Shit!

1599
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:34,486
You got a Instagram?

1600
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:35,607
Want to see?

1601
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:37,161
No.

1602
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:38,611
I'd love to.

1603
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:42,211
Are you getting this?

1604
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:46,691
How sweet!

1605
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:47,841
Right?

1606
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:49,962
Just cute.

1607
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:51,405
Christian?

1608
01:23:56,360 --> 01:23:58,362
Oh. Uh... Don't swipe left.

1609
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:02,205
I was thinking Lonnie and I wouldn't
get to spend Christmas together

1610
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:04,203
because of his grandma.

1611
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:07,081
Cheryl?

1612
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:08,440
Oh! Shit!

1613
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:09,885
Shit!
Hey, Cameron,

1614
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:11,296
you and Niya take
your sister downstairs.

1615
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:12,536
Finish your meal
down there, okay?

1616
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:14,616
- But I didn't even get to see the pictures.
- Now!

1617
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:16,608
I need to see these pictures.

1618
01:24:16,680 --> 01:24:18,170
You get your plate.

1619
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:21,216
- And you get yours. And your napkin.
- You can move faster than that.

1620
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:23,376
See? I always get treated like this.
You need to whip his ass.

1621
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:24,896
This is the problem
with these children nowadays.

1622
01:24:24,920 --> 01:24:26,604
I never get to see stuff.

1623
01:24:26,680 --> 01:24:28,887
Sonya, you gotta take
more control.

1624
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,604
This is not fair.

1625
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:32,646
Be on back.

1626
01:24:32,720 --> 01:24:33,801
Is that oil?

1627
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:35,001
I Skyped you.

1628
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:36,520
- Thank you.
- Wait for me.

1629
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:41,849
All right. Here we go.

1630
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:46,087
Your Grandma Cheryl.

1631
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:51,522
It's obvious that
she misunderstood...

1632
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:53,250
Thanks.
What I said.

1633
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:57,244
You said your grandmother was sick,
and you had to take care of her.

1634
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:58,456
And I love that about you, babe.

1635
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:00,496
- Just shut up.
- So proud of you.

1636
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:04,161
Where is she? I would love
to meet your grandma.

1637
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:05,730
I'd love to meet Grandma Cheryl.

1638
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:08,929
No, baby. You don't want
to meet Grandma Cheryl.

1639
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:10,201
You know what?

1640
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:12,640
I'll get Grandma.

1641
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:14,361
Baby.

1642
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:16,848
Aunt May going to ask you
not to go get Grandma.

1643
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:18,046
Don't disturb Grandma.

1644
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:19,849
I think it's the perfect time
for it.

1645
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:21,056
I'ma ask that
you let Grandma rest

1646
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:25,324
because every time Grandma come out,
something different starts to happen.

1647
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:27,641
We don't have to impress
nobody with Grandma.

1648
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:30,451
Walter, your old ass need
to do something.

1649
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:32,456
Now, you sitting there like
you don't hear this shit.

1650
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:33,561
Lonnie,

1651
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:36,568
you don't want her
to get Grandma.

1652
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:38,841
Christian.

1653
01:25:39,560 --> 01:25:41,289
Let's go in the kitchen.
How about that?

1654
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:42,361
I'm good.

1655
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:44,325
Sonya.

1656
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:50,491
Auntie May, let's go
make some kimchi balls.

1657
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:53,291
Hey, Lonnie. Can't help you.

1658
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:56,764
Baby, did I say something wrong?

1659
01:25:57,320 --> 01:25:59,004
You said a lot of things wrong.

1660
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:00,366
You want to meet Grandma?

1661
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:03,526
Well, here she is.

1662
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:06,096
- Don't shoot me!
- Wait a minute.

1663
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:08,168
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh!

1664
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:10,689
Cheryl! Cheryl! Wait!

1665
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:13,320
Give me that gun!

1666
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:16,724
You all knew who Grandma was!

1667
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:17,881
That's not Grandma!

1668
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:20,247
This is ridiculous!
Somebody say something!

1669
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:21,691
Lonnie, what the hell
is going on?

1670
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:22,761
Shut up!

1671
01:26:22,840 --> 01:26:24,126
I'm his wife, you dumb bitch.

1672
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:25,480
Who you calling a dumb bitch?

1673
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:27,927
You! You dumb bitch, young
bitch, silly bitch, dead bitch.

1674
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,126
She got the gun, bitch.

1675
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:31,576
Lonnie, if you're going to bring
bitches in here, bring a smart bitch.

1676
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:33,682
Give me that rifle,
and give it to me right now!

1677
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:35,330
Stay out of this, Christian.

1678
01:26:35,480 --> 01:26:36,527
Christian, get her!

1679
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:40,124
I'm too old for this shit.

1680
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:42,161
Shit!

1681
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:44,287
Shit!

1682
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:45,441
Christian, stop her.

1683
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:49,122
Cheryl, please! No, no, no!

1684
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:50,720
Cheryl, drop the gun.

1685
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:53,805
Cheryl, you're not going
to shoot me.

1686
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:56,690
You're not going to shoot me outside
in front of all these people.

1687
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,650
- Cheryl, please!
- Enough!

1688
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:01,016
- Walter.
- Okay. That's enough.

1689
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:03,327
Shit! You shot me!
Cheryl, please. Enough.

1690
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:06,051
She's the best shot
in the family, Lonnie.

1691
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:09,806
If she wanted to shoot
your ass, she would have.

1692
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:13,966
Come on.
I'm taking the gun now.

1693
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:16,401
Give it to him, baby.
Let me have it.

1694
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:18,601
I got you.

1695
01:27:19,080 --> 01:27:20,491
We all got you.

1696
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:23,289
We all got you, all right?

1697
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:38,251
Something happened
to Uncle Evan!

1698
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:39,526
What?

1699
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:53,205
Evan's going to be fine.
Thank God.

1700
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:55,965
He's a little banged up,
but very lucky.

1701
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:59,289
We still need to run a few more tests,
but he should be okay to go home.

1702
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:20,801
I don't need...

1703
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:22,006
Any help.

1704
01:28:22,720 --> 01:28:23,881
I know.

1705
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:39,722
I can't believe this is
how we're going to remember

1706
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:41,723
our last Christmas in the house.

1707
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:45,130
At least Evan's okay.

1708
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:49,006
Cheryl...

1709
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:53,484
What I did...

1710
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:58,001
No matter what,
no matter how I felt,

1711
01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:01,041
it was awful.

1712
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,604
Yeah, it was.

1713
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:09,171
I'm sorry.

1714
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:20,090
No.

1715
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:22,402
You probably did me a favor.

1716
01:29:24,040 --> 01:29:27,283
Lonnie had a wandering eye

1717
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:30,003
and a wandering everything else.

1718
01:29:30,160 --> 01:29:31,730
He wasn't going to change.

1719
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,809
And he refused to floss.

1720
01:29:41,680 --> 01:29:45,082
But as much as I want to blame
Lonnie for everything,

1721
01:29:48,920 --> 01:29:51,127
I probably could have been
a little less...

1722
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:52,526
Overbearing?

1723
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:56,965
Controlling.

1724
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:01,087
You're also ambitious
and generous

1725
01:30:01,160 --> 01:30:03,242
and the smartest woman
that I know.

1726
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:05,650
I always wanted to be like you.

1727
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:10,526
You wanted to be like me?

1728
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:14,082
Yeah! You're my big sister.
Of course.

1729
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:15,571
I was always jealous of you.

1730
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:19,924
I mean, Mom and Dad always let you
just figure it out on your own.

1731
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:22,844
Highly overrated.

1732
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:28,691
I was jealous of you
because you never had to.

1733
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:31,647
Also overrated.

1734
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:40,406
So, what are you going to do?

1735
01:30:43,400 --> 01:30:44,640
I don't know.

1736
01:30:48,760 --> 01:30:51,240
Maybe you could help me
with my divorce?

1737
01:30:52,640 --> 01:30:54,404
If you ever get that law degree.

1738
01:30:55,320 --> 01:30:56,970
You can't help yourself,
can you?

1739
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:00,683
I just can't.
Just gotta... You know?

1740
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:02,603
Learned this one.
I earned it.

1741
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:08,451
How you doing?

1742
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:12,802
Okay.
Yeah.

1743
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:19,890
Quite an accident, huh?

1744
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:25,204
Being high on pain pills
probably didn't help.

1745
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:34,006
Mom's never going
to see me graduate,

1746
01:31:35,480 --> 01:31:37,482
never see me in pros,

1747
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:39,844
get married,

1748
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:42,289
have my first kid.

1749
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:47,601
She was supposed
to be my date to the draft.

1750
01:31:47,680 --> 01:31:50,729
We talked about what we was
going to wear and everything.

1751
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:54,962
I know you're missing
your mother.

1752
01:31:56,440 --> 01:31:58,442
She was always there for you.

1753
01:31:58,520 --> 01:31:59,646
Yeah.

1754
01:32:01,240 --> 01:32:02,844
Yeah, she was.

1755
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:07,647
She was always cheering
the loudest.

1756
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:15,442
Every time I caught the ball.

1757
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:20,167
Every time I dropped the ball, she
still was cheering the loudest.

1758
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:23,601
Every moment in my life,

1759
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:26,961
my mother was there for me.

1760
01:32:30,040 --> 01:32:31,849
The one time...

1761
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:34,969
The one moment
that she needed me,

1762
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:36,963
I was not there for her.

1763
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:38,246
Evan.

1764
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:42,090
You were exactly
where she wanted you.

1765
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:45,808
Watching you do what you love

1766
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:48,928
is what she loved.

1767
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:53,250
I mean, she's still watching you
and loving every minute of it.

1768
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:57,043
It's not fair.

1769
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:00,929
It's not. I know.

1770
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:03,967
But numbing the pain
doesn't make it go away.

1771
01:33:04,040 --> 01:33:06,088
Neither does selling the house.

1772
01:33:18,920 --> 01:33:20,331
Without

1773
01:33:22,200 --> 01:33:23,804
your mother,

1774
01:33:27,120 --> 01:33:28,326
it's like...

1775
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:30,646
It's like

1776
01:33:31,680 --> 01:33:33,569
learning to walk again.

1777
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:42,885
Though...

1778
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:46,283
I guess we're gonna
both have to learn together.

1779
01:33:57,680 --> 01:34:00,650
There they are. Managing
directors of Brigham's.

1780
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:02,296
They just want to meet you
before they leave town.

1781
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:03,321
It's not a big deal.

1782
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:04,656
Let's just get it over with.
All right?

1783
01:34:04,680 --> 01:34:06,200
Let's get it over with.
Come on. Smile.

1784
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:15,289
Walter, I'm so glad
you could make it.

1785
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:18,121
We needed you more
than ever this year.

1786
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:21,087
I think I needed you even more.

1787
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:24,931
Merry Christmas.

1788
01:34:26,280 --> 01:34:28,089
Merry Christmas.

1789
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:31,256
- That is so true.
- I tell ya.

1790
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:34,124
Because the truth is, we are going
to make more money than anybody.

1791
01:34:34,200 --> 01:34:36,248
It's going to make people sick.
And you, my man...

1792
01:34:36,720 --> 01:34:38,404
We're going to take you
to the White House.

1793
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:41,329
Yes, sir. I'm not joking.

1794
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:42,845
Don't think I'm playing.

1795
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:49,041
<i>Our prime purpose in life</i>

1796
01:34:49,160 --> 01:34:50,764
<i>is to help people.</i>

1797
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:56,282
<i>And if we cannot help them, at
the very least, don't hurt them.</i>

1798
01:34:58,760 --> 01:34:59,896
You're going to be happy.

1799
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:01,440
And you, my man,
are going to be happy.

1800
01:35:01,680 --> 01:35:02,681
Right?

1801
01:35:03,640 --> 01:35:05,085
I can't do this.

1802
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:08,567
I'm serious. We can take
it to the top. What?

1803
01:35:08,680 --> 01:35:11,411
I believe it. I know we can.

1804
01:35:11,480 --> 01:35:13,403
Have a good evening, gentlemen.

1805
01:35:16,760 --> 01:35:18,888
Merry Christmas and God bless.

1806
01:35:27,560 --> 01:35:32,009
I'm not allowing this place
to go without a fight.

1807
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:37,010
Don't worry, Pop.
You won't be fighting alone.

1808
01:35:40,440 --> 01:35:43,728
You see this old man
skimping on your dressing?

1809
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:45,285
Come on, Pop.

1810
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:47,328
That's more like it.

1811
01:35:47,480 --> 01:35:48,845
Merry Christmas to you.

1812
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:50,161
Thank you.

1813
01:35:57,560 --> 01:35:59,608
I love you, Pop.
I love you, son.

1814
01:36:21,320 --> 01:36:23,084
"If you're going to help me
with my divorce,

1815
01:36:23,160 --> 01:36:26,562
"you gotta finish law school
first. Cheryl."

1816
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:32,201
Wow.

1817
01:36:59,720 --> 01:37:03,247
<i>Is this Grandmaster Munchie
Mega Mellow Mix, Volume 7?</i>

1818
01:37:05,240 --> 01:37:07,846
<i>It's Mellow Mega Mix, Volume 8.</i>

1819
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:09,160
The one I made just for you.

1820
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:13,243
That was a good mix tape.

1821
01:37:14,040 --> 01:37:15,451
It was.

1822
01:37:15,640 --> 01:37:16,926
What are you doing?

1823
01:37:19,560 --> 01:37:21,961
We missed out on something
special 20 years ago.

1824
01:37:22,080 --> 01:37:24,560
And I'll be damned
if I let that happen again.

1825
01:37:25,640 --> 01:37:30,123
So, I was wondering,
if you're not busy tonight

1826
01:37:31,080 --> 01:37:33,003
will you let me take you
to the prom?

1827
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:39,561
Rachel?

1828
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:41,081
Rachel?

1829
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:51,364
Just gonna leave me
out here like that?

1830
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:55,849
I was digging through my mother's attic
for two hours looking for this tape.

1831
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:58,096
Munchie? You
making a lot of noise out there...

1832
01:37:58,120 --> 01:38:00,202
Ma, go to bed!

1833
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:02,771
This is crazy.

1834
01:38:03,200 --> 01:38:05,089
She ain't never gonna change.

1835
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:17,481
Damn.

1836
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:25,771
Damn.

1837
01:38:34,360 --> 01:38:35,725
It's Cheryl's.

1838
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:39,850
I kind of barbecued mine

1839
01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:41,803
after, you know...

1840
01:38:45,720 --> 01:38:47,290
May I have this dance?

1841
01:38:49,680 --> 01:38:50,761
Yeah.

1842
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:05,240
It's gonna be a terrible night.

1843
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:08,004
Absolute worst.

1844
01:39:55,400 --> 01:39:57,243
Talk about going out
with a bang.

1845
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:02,120
Yeah.

1846
01:40:02,280 --> 01:40:05,011
I sure am going
to miss this old house.

1847
01:40:06,920 --> 01:40:08,046
Yeah.

1848
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:10,921
Hmm.

1849
01:40:13,080 --> 01:40:14,127
When I

1850
01:40:16,120 --> 01:40:17,963
proposed to Grace,

1851
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:24,329
I knew I was going
to do everything I could

1852
01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:26,641
to give her
the best life possible.

1853
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:32,971
Sometimes I...

1854
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:38,482
Sometimes I think
I didn't do enough.

1855
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:43,126
I really didn't think
it was possible.

1856
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:46,641
But you really are dumber
than you look.

1857
01:40:49,120 --> 01:40:50,485
You know,

1858
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:56,208
I've performed with some
of the greatest entertainers

1859
01:40:56,560 --> 01:40:58,801
to ever grace a stage.

1860
01:41:00,760 --> 01:41:03,923
And I've dined atop
of the Eiffel Tower

1861
01:41:04,120 --> 01:41:08,364
as the lights shined as
bright as a thousand stars.

1862
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:13,608
Even got drunk
in a pub in Denmark

1863
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:16,206
with the Count of Rosenberg.

1864
01:41:17,880 --> 01:41:19,450
He was a huge fan.

1865
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:22,410
That was when I was on that
Sly and the Family Stone tour.

1866
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:23,520
Mmm-hmm.
Remember that one?

1867
01:41:23,560 --> 01:41:24,800
Little Sister.
Yes.

1868
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:28,131
Yes, indeed.

1869
01:41:31,720 --> 01:41:32,960
You know,

1870
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:40,089
I'm living
my happily ever after.

1871
01:41:41,680 --> 01:41:43,284
And because of you

1872
01:41:43,960 --> 01:41:45,405
and with you,

1873
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:49,086
my beautiful sister

1874
01:41:49,240 --> 01:41:52,403
got to live
her happily ever after, too.

1875
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:02,405
Yes, she did.

1876
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:12,484
How you like it?

1877
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:13,686
That's Turkish coffee.

1878
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:17,560
Got that on the Chaka Khan tour.
Tell Me Something Good, 1982!

1879
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:19,970
Best coffee I ever had.

1880
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:22,047
Yes, indeed.

1881
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:26,731
You know what?

1882
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:30,127
We ain't tried your pie, Walter.

1883
01:42:30,200 --> 01:42:32,168
Maybe it's for the best.
No.

1884
01:42:32,240 --> 01:42:34,129
How bad could it be?

1885
01:42:34,200 --> 01:42:36,521
Well. Well, we gonna see.

1886
01:42:39,560 --> 01:42:41,403
I'm tryin' to scoop
that piece out of there.

1887
01:42:42,080 --> 01:42:45,971
You put this together, Walter. Now,
let's see what we're dealing with.

1888
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:36,206
I'll be damned.

1889
01:43:40,720 --> 01:43:42,051
Well, wait a minute,
Walter. Damn!

1890
01:43:42,120 --> 01:43:44,122
You ain't gonna eat
all of it! Give me some.

1891
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:46,165
There's a little crust there.

1892
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:49,801
Hey!

1893
01:43:50,640 --> 01:43:52,927
Hey, Cheryl! Sonya!

1894
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:56,126
Come on.
Rachel, come on. All of you!

1895
01:43:56,200 --> 01:43:58,567
Come on down here
and get some of this pie!

1896
01:43:58,640 --> 01:43:59,801
I did it!

1897
01:44:01,040 --> 01:44:02,121
I did it!

1898
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:05,521
I'ma get some more of this
Turkish coffee for everybody.

1899
01:44:05,600 --> 01:44:06,761
Okay, then.

1900
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:10,208
Hey! Come and get
some of this pie! I did it!

1901
01:44:10,280 --> 01:44:11,770
Come on, all of you!

1902
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:13,205
Hey, Christian, all of you!

1903
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:15,886
Hey, Cheryl! Evan! Rachel!

1904
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:06,841
Nuts.

1905
01:45:08,360 --> 01:45:09,885
Am I tasting your nuts?

1906
01:45:14,360 --> 01:45:16,806
You feeling like that,
Rachel? Huh?

1907
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:18,086
'Cause I'm every woman.

1908
01:45:18,200 --> 01:45:19,896
I ain't scared of you, Aunt May.
Well, then bring...

1909
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:21,081
Bitch!

1910
01:45:24,040 --> 01:45:26,008
Cut. Cut!

1911
01:45:26,200 --> 01:45:28,407
Okay, Santa.
I'm going back in, baby.

1912
01:45:29,560 --> 01:45:30,766
How do you like that?

1913
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:34,009
Too much, Santa?

1914
01:45:34,080 --> 01:45:35,081
Hold on, now.

1915
01:45:35,240 --> 01:45:40,246
To wash it all down, some milk
tea with boiled tapioca balls.

1916
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:41,925
We don't put balls in our mouth.

1917
01:45:42,080 --> 01:45:43,730
Not necessarily.

1918
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:50,361
Aunt May studied tae kwon do
in a dojo in Taipei,

1919
01:45:50,440 --> 01:45:53,046
and they called me
Sensei Titty Chop.

1920
01:45:53,120 --> 01:45:56,203
You know why they called me that?
Because I chops bitches' titties.

1921
01:45:56,280 --> 01:45:57,486
Ask Tina Turner about me.

1922
01:45:57,760 --> 01:46:01,003
I can always kick her ass. One time,
I had to titty-chop that bitch.

1923
01:46:01,160 --> 01:46:03,736
Well, I'ma tell you, you can't
have none of this ass, Lonnie.

1924
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:07,000
If you were biting your wife's ass some
more, maybe y'all have a happier marriage.

1925
01:46:07,400 --> 01:46:09,016
Bite it, lick it,
whatever you need to do.

1926
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:10,400
She look unhappy
as shit out there,

1927
01:46:10,440 --> 01:46:12,966
worrying about do the fish
have goddamn teeth.

1928
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:14,406
Baby, do I bite your ass?

1929
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:15,971
Every night.

1930
01:46:16,480 --> 01:46:17,766
You heard that?

1931
01:46:21,440 --> 01:46:23,408
My bags are in the car.
Mmm-mm.

1932
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:25,045
My bags aren't in the damn car.

1933
01:46:25,120 --> 01:46:27,043
They in the driveway. Okay?

1934
01:46:27,120 --> 01:46:28,616
That's where my shit is.

1935
01:46:28,640 --> 01:46:30,722
And because I ain't had
my medication,

1936
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:33,167
I don't know what I'm saying,
goddamn Walter.

1937
01:46:33,280 --> 01:46:34,281
Damn!

1938
01:46:34,360 --> 01:46:37,887
You could just have something rolled for
me or something when I come to visit.

1939
01:46:37,960 --> 01:46:40,088
That's why you killed
my damn sister off.

1940
01:46:40,160 --> 01:46:41,730
Because you
don't treat her right.

1941
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:42,847
Shit!

1942
01:46:47,640 --> 01:46:48,687
Cut.

1943
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:52,525
<i>All right, cut! Cut!</i>

1944
01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:55,604
<i>Cut! Cut. Let's do it again.</i>
