- Yes, well, you were,

176
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:38,533
but Presbyterians, Brinnan.

177
00:11:38,667 --> 00:11:41,235
Yes, um, let's get you
to your hotel.

178
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:44,338
No, no, we'll have a heroic
night, I must make it up to you.

179
00:11:44,471 --> 00:11:47,408
I can tell you're upset,
we'll go to the Minetta Tavern

180
00:11:47,542 --> 00:11:49,376
and have a few drinks there,
meet some old friends

181
00:11:49,511 --> 00:11:51,045
and then on
to the San Remo...

182
00:11:51,178 --> 00:11:52,581
No, no, no, no, no,
but I would like...

183
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:54,982
Save the best for
our return to New York...

184
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:58,052
the White Horse,
my promiscuous muse...

185
00:11:58,185 --> 00:12:00,854
but let's gather our rosebuds
while we may.

186
00:12:00,988 --> 00:12:02,723
This is a gift, I've been
wanting to give that to you.

187
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:04,358
Gift? Thank God,
I thought it might be

188
00:12:04,491 --> 00:12:07,394
that awful book
you've been working on.

189
00:12:07,529 --> 00:12:10,497
And I'm very glad it is.

190
00:12:10,632 --> 00:12:15,035
We met in a pub, of course,
the Wheatsheaf in Fitzrovia,

191
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:18,405
we were, uh, immediately
attracted to each other

192
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:23,712
and started what was
to become a long series of...

193
00:12:23,844 --> 00:12:26,080
wonderful nights together.

194
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:32,886
Do you remember
our first time, Dylan?

195
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,389
Yes, of course.

196
00:12:35,523 --> 00:12:39,460
It was a time of
great wonderment.

197
00:12:39,594 --> 00:12:41,128
You took off your trousers
and you didn't have

198
00:12:41,262 --> 00:12:46,300
any underpants on,
which was slightly grotesque.

199
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,802
But then you never
wore them... why?

200
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:54,241
Hmm, it's a time-saving
measure.

201
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:57,811
You ran... ran into bed
and got under the sheets

202
00:12:57,945 --> 00:13:00,981
as quickly as you could.

203
00:13:01,115 --> 00:13:06,086
You still had your jacket
and shirt on and your socks.

204
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,155
I think it's 'cause you didn't
want me to see your funny,

205
00:13:08,289 --> 00:13:10,592
little, pink body,
do you remember that?

206
00:13:10,725 --> 00:13:12,960
I remember that.

207
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:17,031
Time stood still,
and cloistered from the world,

208
00:13:17,164 --> 00:13:18,767
safe from it all.

209
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:22,102
Tempests could've raged
behind the walls and waves

210
00:13:22,236 --> 00:13:28,777
could've bust away the city,
but we were safe... magic.

211
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:30,978
You had such
a funny body then.

212
00:13:31,111 --> 00:13:33,180
It was like a pink turtle
without its shell.

213
00:13:33,314 --> 00:13:38,218
Yes, you keep saying...
it's a recurring theme.

214
00:13:38,352 --> 00:13:40,789
That's all we remember,
images, I suppose,

215
00:13:40,921 --> 00:13:44,425
some of them fixed
in the mind.

216
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:47,828
Well, why wasn't mine
like any other?

217
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:51,832
Why should that be any different
for you or any other woman?

218
00:13:55,503 --> 00:13:58,939
Then we went to visit
Augustus, do you remember that?

219
00:13:59,073 --> 00:14:02,409
And he didn't know
anything about us.

220
00:14:02,544 --> 00:14:04,244
And you and I,
we got in the backseat

221
00:14:04,378 --> 00:14:08,048
and we kissed and fondled.

222
00:14:08,182 --> 00:14:11,686
And he could see it all
in the mirror.

223
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,221
Made him drive faster,

224
00:14:14,355 --> 00:14:18,392
and faster which only made
the fondling more pleasurable.

225
00:14:20,528 --> 00:14:23,565
Imagine, one's love
of squeezing your breast

226
00:14:23,698 --> 00:14:27,901
being your last sensation
before death.

227
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:29,970
Do you remember that?

228
00:14:30,104 --> 00:14:33,107
I remember.

229
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,743
And then when we got back
to the house

230
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:37,679
Augustus wanted to fight me.

231
00:14:37,812 --> 00:14:39,647
And I did
rather well, I think.

232
00:14:39,781 --> 00:14:44,051
No! He beat you up, terribly,
you were so pathetic

233
00:14:44,184 --> 00:14:48,690
and wounded, your face
all red with cuts and bruises!

234
00:14:51,693 --> 00:14:55,496
- I loved you then.
- And I loved you.

235
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:02,936
Well, perhaps if you had been
beaten more often.

236
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,706
Well, had I known
you liked it so much,

237
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:06,974
I'd have beaten myself
like a flagellist.

238
00:15:07,107 --> 00:15:10,244
Well, had I known that,
then I would've asked.

239
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:18,085
Will you not come with me
to New York, Caitlin?

240
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:22,256
I won't be able to breathe
without you, it's so...

241
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:27,428
noisy there and so... tall.

242
00:15:30,197 --> 00:15:34,903
Caitlin... Caitlin?

243
00:15:42,242 --> 00:15:44,779
WOMAN: How did this happen?

244
00:15:44,913 --> 00:15:46,815
It may not be
as bad as all that.

245
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:48,315
It is a cataclysm.

246
00:15:48,449 --> 00:15:49,918
- Potential.
- It is a cataclysm,

247
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,318
it is apocalyptic.

248
00:15:51,452 --> 00:15:52,854
Really? Dorothy.

249
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:56,123
Really? Roger, shut up,
I am speaking.

250
00:15:56,256 --> 00:16:01,161
My God!
This is Vassar College!

251
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:06,133
And you...
bringing a drunken,

252
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:07,802
debaucherous libertarian
to this college...

253
00:16:07,936 --> 00:16:09,871
I... I'm in charge
of booking the speakers

254
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:12,674
for the Autumn term.

255
00:16:12,807 --> 00:16:16,443
Oh?

256
00:16:16,578 --> 00:16:19,079
Of course you are.

257
00:16:19,213 --> 00:16:23,785
Not the Empress of Russia,
or a fairy princess?

258
00:16:23,918 --> 00:16:26,955
No, you are in charge
of booking the speakers

259
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:28,989
for the Autumn term.

260
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:33,293
That is an honorary position and
should not be taken seriously

261
00:16:33,427 --> 00:16:36,196
by anyone, least of all, anyone
charged with your supervision.

262
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:40,702
I'm looking at her, Roger,
but I'm thinking of you.

263
00:16:40,835 --> 00:16:43,036
What is your name, dear?

264
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,839
Penelope Goldstein.

265
00:16:48,342 --> 00:16:52,814
Penelope Goldstein.

266
00:16:52,947 --> 00:16:57,384
Well, Penelope,
if this man

267
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,219
should embarrass the college
in any way,

268
00:16:59,353 --> 00:17:01,221
if anything at all should
happen, I promise you

269
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:05,292
that your time
at Vassar College is over.

270
00:17:05,425 --> 00:17:07,862
Am I making myself clear?

271
00:17:07,996 --> 00:17:11,265
[rain falling,
thunder rumbling]

272
00:17:11,398 --> 00:17:13,100
PENELOPE ON PHONE:
<i>It's very, very important.</i>

273
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:15,102
Yes, yes, I promise you
he'll be there, yes.

274
00:17:15,235 --> 00:17:16,538
<i>Very important.</i>

275
00:17:16,671 --> 00:17:19,541
Um, yes, Vassar
is very important to him

276
00:17:19,674 --> 00:17:21,074
and you have my
personal assurance.

277
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,243
- <i>Thank you.</i>
- Yes, All right,

278
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:25,412
- thank you very much.
- <i>Thank you.</i>

279
00:17:25,547 --> 00:17:26,614
- Oh!
- More troubles.

280
00:17:26,748 --> 00:17:28,716
Some young girl
worried about...

281
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,018
Least of your problems.

282
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,586
Ha-ha-ha,
you laugh at me, Felton,

283
00:17:31,719 --> 00:17:34,388
- but to be around genius...
- Brinnan, please.

284
00:17:34,522 --> 00:17:36,991
No, it's like the caring
of a golden chalice,

285
00:17:37,124 --> 00:17:38,526
- is that ridiculous?
- Yes.

286
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:41,930
- Or a magical elixir?
- Stop.

287
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:44,699
That when you drink it,
the world is forever altered.

288
00:17:44,832 --> 00:17:47,936
Oh, it must be bleak
for you, I am sorry.

289
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:49,403
[sighing]
I just don't want

290
00:17:49,537 --> 00:17:51,071
to ask him for anything.

291
00:17:51,204 --> 00:17:53,942
No, of course not, just a few
phrases for the jacket

292
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:56,778
of your book, which will put you
on the map, pay all your bills

293
00:17:56,911 --> 00:17:59,212
and validate your
hitherto pointless loitering

294
00:17:59,346 --> 00:18:00,949
on this planet.

295
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:04,519
And don't do your injured look,
it gives me a rash.

296
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,256
Yes, I would like for him
to find merit in my book...

297
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:10,959
is that too much to ask?

298
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:15,897
Who could say it was
good or bad, and who cares?

299
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,665
Do find a way
to try and flog

300
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:20,935
the massive pile of crap,
I sense.

301
00:18:21,069 --> 00:18:23,236
It's not crap, Felton,
it's my life's work.

302
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:26,139
Brinnan, we all have lives,

303
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:29,744
it doesn't mean
they're important.

304
00:18:29,877 --> 00:18:32,145
[rain falling]

305
00:18:33,881 --> 00:18:35,449
What did he say?

306
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:37,785
He told me not to worry
my little girlish head.

307
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,252
Okay, then,
that's good, right?

308
00:18:39,386 --> 00:18:40,755
Thanks, Alexi.

309
00:18:40,888 --> 00:18:42,289
I didn't mean that,
I mean that

310
00:18:42,422 --> 00:18:45,026
- it's good he's coming, right?
- Right.

311
00:18:45,158 --> 00:18:48,596
Well, maybe, you know,
it wasn't worth all the worry?

312
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:51,099
Why do you always have to say
something stupid, Alexi?

313
00:18:51,231 --> 00:18:54,068
I prefer when you just say
innocuous and sincere things

314
00:18:54,201 --> 00:18:57,071
you heard your professor say
but then you have to improv.

315
00:18:57,204 --> 00:19:00,307
Jeopardizing four years of
college to get some drunk poet

316
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,811
doesn't really seem like
the best thing to do, does it?

317
00:19:03,945 --> 00:19:05,847
I'd like you
to stop talking now.

318
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,616
Smoke, or something,
pose, do anything,

319
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:12,319
- but please be quiet.
- I mean, who is he?

320
00:19:12,452 --> 00:19:14,722
- I loved him.
- Pardon?

321
00:19:14,856 --> 00:19:18,693
I love him... I... I love his
ideas, I love his voice,

322
00:19:18,826 --> 00:19:20,394
I love his language,
I love everything about him,

323
00:19:20,528 --> 00:19:22,329
I'd have his child
if he asked me to.

324
00:19:22,462 --> 00:19:24,532
- You are joking.
- Which part?

325
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,534
The child.

326
00:19:26,668 --> 00:19:28,102
No, that's the part I mean
most of all, I'm actually

327
00:19:28,235 --> 00:19:29,637
checking my ovulation cycle,

328
00:19:29,771 --> 00:19:32,472
hoping it will correspond
to his visit.

329
00:19:32,607 --> 00:19:36,811
You're mad and not funny.
You don't even know him.

330
00:19:36,944 --> 00:19:38,112
It's so much easier to love
people we don't know,

331
00:19:38,245 --> 00:19:39,881
don't you think?

332
00:19:40,014 --> 00:19:42,382
Oh, I get it,
you're making fun of me.

333
00:19:42,517 --> 00:19:44,552
Yes, I am.

334
00:19:53,293 --> 00:19:57,699
Good news, gentlemen,
more room at the inn.

335
00:19:57,832 --> 00:19:59,466
Like the crew
of a sinking ship,

336
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,603
we evacuated through
all available portals.

337
00:20:02,737 --> 00:20:03,938
Glad to hear it.

338
00:20:04,072 --> 00:20:05,940
- Did you leave a mess?
- A little one.

339
00:20:06,074 --> 00:20:08,208
I daren't look,
and that'll be the poor sod

340
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:09,844
that has to clean that.

341
00:20:24,726 --> 00:20:26,359
You are inscrutable,
Carlos.

342
00:20:26,493 --> 00:20:28,096
Am I?

343
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:30,832

You wouldn't

348
00:20:39,974 --> 00:20:42,342
Something salacious, I hope,
or saucy, detective novel

349

of the old west

350
00:20:44,078 --> 00:20:45,378

the Holy Bible

352

I don't read saucy
detective novels

353

about the old west.

354
00:20:53,121 --> 00:20:55,022

- Pornography, of course.

355
00:20:55,156 --> 00:20:57,257
I have a completely open mind
in that regard, there's some

356
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:01,028
very good pornography,
my wife's diaries, for example.

357
00:21:02,697 --> 00:21:04,464
Not pornography.

Ah, well, you shall remain
inscrutable, then, Carlos.

359
00:21:11,606 --> 00:21:14,441
But a drink
must not be a mystery,

360
00:21:14,575 --> 00:21:16,644

what shall we call this?

361
00:21:16,778 --> 00:21:20,313
You're the king,

362
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:24,317
Ah, Teddy, for you happen
to mistook me all this while,

363
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:26,120

Feel, want, taste grief,
need friends, subjected,

365
00:21:29,356 --> 00:21:31,659

say to me that I'm a king?

366
00:21:31,793 --> 00:21:37,665
Yeah, well, you're the king,
so you name 'em.

367
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:40,433
Well, I had some time to
ruminate on this, as it happens,

368
00:21:40,568 --> 00:21:42,503
when I was indisposed in the WC,
not always a place

369
00:21:42,637 --> 00:21:45,139
of inspiration,
but today served.

370
00:21:45,273 --> 00:21:46,339
- We shall call this drink...
- Yes?

371
00:21:46,473 --> 00:21:48,142
- Hope.
- Hope?

372
00:21:48,276 --> 00:21:50,278
Yes, you see, the enthusiasm
for which the second drink

373
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,113
was named can seem unfounded.

374
00:21:52,246 --> 00:21:55,116
The ordinary world is not
an easy place, but with hope,

375
00:21:55,249 --> 00:21:57,852
the simple can be replaced
by the faintest magorical,

376
00:21:57,985 --> 00:21:59,687
and the third drink
brings us that hope.

377
00:21:59,821 --> 00:22:01,989
Hope that simple things
which only moments ago

378
00:22:02,123 --> 00:22:05,793
seemed banal but in time
acquire magical qualities.

379

medicine, but only hope.

- Yes, just now.

Oh, the miserable have no
other medicine, but only hope.

MAN: That is beautiful.

I don't know.
Maybe the nuns.

Is it from one of the Gospels?
They probably beat it...

no, Shakespeare, Shakespeare.

a bit of a dark horse, Dylan.

00:30:26,026 --> 00:30:28,896
Though my taste
does run to the strange.

515
00:30:34,468 --> 00:30:37,338
Will you come to me,
my love?

516
00:30:37,471 --> 00:30:41,875
I'm lonely and I care
so little for everything now.

517
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:44,746
I think of you.

518
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:54,355
Dylan... money is short.

519
00:30:54,488 --> 00:30:58,058
Send some at once.

520
00:30:58,192 --> 00:31:02,664
I am entirely serious.

521
00:31:02,797 --> 00:31:08,670
We shall have to sell
one of the children.

522
00:31:08,803 --> 00:31:11,372
Which one do you recommend?

523
00:31:14,676 --> 00:31:19,647
[train rattling]

524
00:31:27,655 --> 00:31:31,191
[muffled applause and cheering]

525
00:31:41,168 --> 00:31:44,405
[coughing]

526
00:31:49,076 --> 00:31:50,745
I worry, Carlos.

527
00:31:50,879 --> 00:31:53,782
- About that cough?
- No, not about the cough.

528
00:31:53,914 --> 00:31:56,116
That I will be forgotten
by all except young girls

529
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:59,052
at ladies colleges and young men
whose earlier pubescent

530
00:31:59,186 --> 00:32:01,255
awkwardness has caused them
to think they've suffered

531
00:32:01,388 --> 00:32:04,057
more than others and should
therefore grow beards.

532
00:32:04,191 --> 00:32:07,127
- That's what you worry about.
- Yes! Sometimes.

533
00:32:07,261 --> 00:32:10,063
TEDDY: I worry about snakes.

534
00:32:10,197 --> 00:32:13,100
- Another?
- Yes, why not?

535
00:32:13,233 --> 00:32:15,936
I was thinking how easy
seduction is.

536
00:32:16,069 --> 00:32:17,304
I think
I know what you mean,

537
00:32:17,438 --> 00:32:19,106
I haven't done
too badly myself.

538
00:32:19,239 --> 00:32:21,041
Yes, well done, Carlos,
I was speaking of seduction

539
00:32:21,175 --> 00:32:23,210
in the broader sense,

540
00:32:23,343 --> 00:32:25,279
causing those
to hear one to love one,

541
00:32:25,412 --> 00:32:29,183
a group seduction, a hypnosis
of an entire audience.

542
00:32:29,316 --> 00:32:33,487
Hmm. That sounds harder than
hitting on some depressed girl

543
00:32:33,621 --> 00:32:35,122
who just broke up
with her boyfriend.

544
00:32:35,255 --> 00:32:36,990
Yes, but it's
all trick, Carlos.

545
00:32:37,124 --> 00:32:38,626
- Is that right?
- [coughing]

546
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,595
TEDDY: Are you gonna
name that one?

547
00:32:40,728 --> 00:32:45,600
Ah, yes, the fourth, the
fourth, the fourth, the fourth.

548
00:32:45,733 --> 00:32:51,438
We shall call this...
recalcitrance.

549
00:32:51,573 --> 00:32:53,340
A lack of respect...
[bangs bar]

550
00:32:53,474 --> 00:32:55,075
...for the self-righteous...
[bangs bar]

551
00:32:55,209 --> 00:32:56,945
...and higher demands...
[bangs bar]

552
00:32:57,077 --> 00:33:00,715
...to stop before excess.
[bangs bar]

553
00:33:00,849 --> 00:33:04,051
To recalcitrance!
Hmm.

554
00:33:04,184 --> 00:33:06,987
[jazz music playing]

555
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,656
BRINNAN: Yes, there's problems.

556
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:12,125
Drunkenness... rudeness,
lunging after women.

557
00:33:12,259 --> 00:33:14,261
Yes, yes, yes, perhaps artists
have different views

558
00:33:14,394 --> 00:33:18,398
of things, it's the excitement
of the iconoclastic mind.

559
00:33:18,533 --> 00:33:21,368
Oh, I used to expect
so little in return.

560
00:33:21,503 --> 00:33:22,804
- Oh, yes.
- How long?

561
00:33:22,937 --> 00:33:24,539
Eight years.

562
00:33:24,672 --> 00:33:26,774
That's a long time
writing a book, eight years.

563
00:33:26,908 --> 00:33:28,442
It's hard to finish,

564
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:30,845
you open yourself up to
judgement and condemnation.

565
00:33:30,979 --> 00:33:33,347
Your life wholly
in the hands of someone else.

566
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,917
Oh, my life in his hands.

567
00:33:36,049 --> 00:33:38,051
People put their lives
in my hands all the time,

568
00:33:38,185 --> 00:33:41,221
stop taking it seriously
after a while.

569
00:33:44,859 --> 00:33:46,661
I just want him
to like it.

570
00:33:46,794 --> 00:33:51,566
And failing that, to like it,
for all you've done for him?

571
00:33:51,699 --> 00:33:54,501
Have you ever
heard him read?

572
00:33:54,636 --> 00:33:59,239
Just an eye chart,
but he did it beautifully.

573
00:33:59,373 --> 00:34:04,612
If you could hear him read
I think you'd understand...

574
00:34:04,746 --> 00:34:09,149
That he's better
than we are.

575
00:34:09,283 --> 00:34:14,087
It was all shining,
it was Adam and maiden,

576
00:34:14,221 --> 00:34:19,861
the sky gathered again, and the
sun grew round that very day.

577
00:34:19,994 --> 00:34:23,463
So it must have been after
the birth of the simple light

578
00:34:23,598 --> 00:34:26,366
in the first spinning place,

579
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:30,772
the spellbound horses walking
warm out of the whinnying

580
00:34:30,905 --> 00:34:36,410
green stable on to
the fields of praise.

581
00:34:36,544 --> 00:34:41,214
And honored among foxes
and pheasants by the gay house

582
00:34:41,348 --> 00:34:46,521
under the new-made clouds
and happy as the heart was long,

583
00:34:46,654 --> 00:34:52,994
in the sun born over and over,
I ran my heedless ways.

584
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:59,801
I will read it, Brinnan.

585
00:34:59,934 --> 00:35:01,468
I wasn't talking
about that, Dylan.

586
00:35:01,603 --> 00:35:03,571
- No?
- No.

587
00:35:03,705 --> 00:35:06,440
But if you don't mind me asking,
how far along had you gotten?

588
00:35:06,574 --> 00:35:08,776
Well, coming up to
the interesting bit, I hope.

589
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:10,712
Ah, and what is the
interesting bit?

590
00:35:10,845 --> 00:35:12,080
Well, you would
know, dear boy,

591
00:35:12,212 --> 00:35:14,882
I haven't got there
yet, have I?

592
00:35:19,887 --> 00:35:21,188
[general conversations]

593
00:35:21,321 --> 00:35:23,992
Number five, Mr. Thomas!

594
00:35:24,124 --> 00:35:25,593
Freewheel!

595
00:35:25,727 --> 00:35:27,461
He's rather beautiful.

596
00:35:27,595 --> 00:35:28,930
Will you name it
beauty, then?

597
00:35:29,063 --> 00:35:31,164
No, on, no, no,
we shall call it faith.

598
00:35:31,298 --> 00:35:32,634
- Faith?
- Yes, faith.

599
00:35:32,767 --> 00:35:35,435
You calling something faith.
Why faith?

600
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:37,005
Don't offend my customers,
please, Felix.

601
00:35:37,137 --> 00:35:38,472
He doesn't mean
any harm, Carlos.

602
00:35:38,606 --> 00:35:39,941
Who's doing
the harm here?

603
00:35:40,074 --> 00:35:41,509
Faith that the drinks
that follow

604
00:35:41,643 --> 00:35:44,679
or whatever is to follow
holds great promise!

605
00:35:44,812 --> 00:35:47,649
Faith for those who have it
has more certainty than hope,

606
00:35:47,782 --> 00:35:49,083
but less evidence,

607
00:35:49,216 --> 00:35:50,952
making it all the more
remarkable

608
00:35:51,085 --> 00:35:52,152
and therefore beautiful.

609
00:35:52,285 --> 00:35:53,788
To faith!
Cheers!

610
00:35:53,921 --> 00:35:56,658
To one who has faith,
no explanation is necessary.

611
00:35:56,791 --> 00:35:59,827
To one without faith,
no explanation is possible.

612
00:35:59,961 --> 00:36:01,963
- Carlos. Carlos, Carlos...
- What?

613
00:36:02,096 --> 00:36:03,497
- That?
- Yes, that!

614
00:36:03,631 --> 00:36:05,066
St. Thomas Aquinas!

615
00:36:05,198 --> 00:36:07,501
- Oh, the nuns again!
- Absolutely, sir.

616
00:36:07,635 --> 00:36:09,436
- He has a good memory.
- I don't know about that.

617
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:11,204
Just a bartender
who whips out the odd phrase

618
00:36:11,338 --> 00:36:13,041
to impress the ladies.

619
00:36:13,173 --> 00:36:16,376
Oh, the ladies respond in
a big way to St. Thomas Aquinas.

620
00:36:16,511 --> 00:36:17,545
You'd be surprised, sir.

621
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:19,212
It doesn't mean
anything to me,

622
00:36:19,346 --> 00:36:21,983
it just sounds pretty,
sounds like it means something.

623
00:36:22,116 --> 00:36:24,085
My dad used to talk
very preachy to my mother,

624
00:36:24,217 --> 00:36:25,687
then he would beat
the fuck out of her.

625
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,889
I figured it wasn't what
he said that mattered

626
00:36:28,022 --> 00:36:30,490
or how pretty he sounded
or whether it meant anything.

627
00:36:30,625 --> 00:36:36,430
[conversation pauses]

628
00:36:36,564 --> 00:36:40,467
[conversation resumes]

629
00:36:43,938 --> 00:36:46,339
And speaking of money, Dylan,

630
00:36:46,473 --> 00:36:49,476
Brinnan tells me you're inclined
to buy everyone's drinks

631
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:52,880
and are betting on horses.

632
00:36:53,014 --> 00:36:57,250
I would point out,
in passing, that your children

633
00:36:57,384 --> 00:37:01,254
are virtually without
clothes or food

634
00:37:01,388 --> 00:37:05,693
and that we are having
to rely on charity.

635
00:37:05,827 --> 00:37:11,231
Brinnan also mentioned...

636
00:37:11,364 --> 00:37:15,737
that you have a mistress.

637
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:21,075
I do hope she's not
the expensive kind.

638
00:37:21,209 --> 00:37:27,648
One of the more economical
variety in our circumstances

639
00:37:27,782 --> 00:37:32,553
would seem more appropriate.

640
00:37:37,357 --> 00:37:40,728
You are a bastard.

641
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,036
The children
send their love.

642
00:38:00,782 --> 00:38:04,417
CARLOS: There they are.

643
00:38:04,552 --> 00:38:07,487
So this is the, uh,
sixth, is it, Carlos?

644
00:38:07,622 --> 00:38:09,289
There are five glasses
on the bar, Dylan,

645
00:38:09,422 --> 00:38:11,159
so that must be
the sixth and seventh.

646
00:38:11,291 --> 00:38:12,927
Yes, thank you, Felix.

647
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,762
None of my business,
but couldn't you stop now?

648
00:38:14,896 --> 00:38:16,564
I could, Felix,
but the fifth is faith

649
00:38:16,697 --> 00:38:19,432
and it proved unfounded, it was
inevitable, we all lose faith

650
00:38:19,567 --> 00:38:21,169
at some point, at least
for a little while,

651
00:38:21,301 --> 00:38:24,071
then comes that ennui,
that mordant contemplation

652
00:38:24,205 --> 00:38:29,510
of how little future holds
and our own certain death...

653
00:38:29,644 --> 00:38:31,846
To new mistakes.

654
00:38:31,979 --> 00:38:34,882
That seems sort of sad,
Mr. Thomas.

655
00:38:35,016 --> 00:38:38,318
Yes, it is
a little sad, Teddy.

656
00:38:38,451 --> 00:38:41,656
But do not despair
because here is the seventh.

657
00:38:41,789 --> 00:38:43,291
Is that a good one?

658
00:38:43,423 --> 00:38:44,625
Oh, this is a good one,
this is resurrection.

659
00:38:44,759 --> 00:38:46,260
Oh, stop.

660
00:38:46,393 --> 00:38:48,930
The spirit, which only
moments ago seemed so bound

661
00:38:49,063 --> 00:38:51,999
to the earth now seems to soar
above and our companions

662
00:38:52,133 --> 00:38:55,136
who formerly seemed so tedious
now seem to offer insights

663
00:38:55,269 --> 00:38:57,171
that we are certain
to remember, if not forever,

664
00:38:57,305 --> 00:39:00,641
then certainly until
lunchtime next week.

665
00:39:00,775 --> 00:39:03,010
To resurrection.

666
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,982
Do you mean us,
Mr. Thomas?

667
00:39:08,115 --> 00:39:10,218
- Mean you, Teddy?
- Tedious companions?

668
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:14,789
No, no, not you, no, shh,
I meant the others.

669
00:39:21,461 --> 00:39:23,331
Damn it.

670
00:39:23,463 --> 00:39:26,901
I don't know where he is.

671
00:39:27,034 --> 00:39:28,336
He's not in his room
at the Chelsea

672
00:39:28,468 --> 00:39:31,205
and that girl
keeps calling.

673
00:39:31,339 --> 00:39:34,008
- [moaning]
- I called the San Remo,

674
00:39:34,141 --> 00:39:36,210
- the Minetta.
- White Horse Tavern.

675
00:39:36,344 --> 00:39:38,079
Twice... they said
he wasn't there.

676
00:39:38,212 --> 00:39:43,416
Well, there are only a few
hundred other bars in New York.

677
00:39:43,551 --> 00:39:46,754
If you have a yellow pages,
there's hope.

678
00:39:50,725 --> 00:39:53,761
He promised he'd be done
with the book by tonight.

679
00:39:53,895 --> 00:39:57,765
Perhaps he's in
the library reading it now.

680
00:39:57,899 --> 00:40:00,400
Okay, you know, you know,
Felton, for a friend, you are...

681
00:40:00,534 --> 00:40:03,070
What do you expect?
He's been nothing but trouble.

682
00:40:03,204 --> 00:40:04,705
- Him?
- This tour,

683
00:40:04,839 --> 00:40:06,574
it's wearing you down.

684
00:40:06,707 --> 00:40:09,377

687
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:18,552

a bit distracting.

688
00:40:18,686 --> 00:40:23,324
"The Bermuda shorts,"
he says. Ugh.

689
00:40:23,456 --> 00:40:26,459
At times he stands too close
to them and...

690
00:40:26,594 --> 00:40:29,931
- And?
- Makes suggestions.

691
00:40:30,064 --> 00:40:33,968
- Oh.
- And the drinking... God.

692
00:40:34,101 --> 00:40:36,404
- But no matter how...
- Drunk.

693
00:40:36,537 --> 00:40:39,774
Yes... he is strangely
reliable.

694
00:40:39,907 --> 00:40:43,476
Yes, he has vices,
but he still has principles.

695
00:40:43,611 --> 00:40:47,447
He will read it,
I'm certain of it.

00:40:47,581 --> 00:40:50,418
In any case, his wife
is on the three o'clock plane,

Another great favor.

698

You're a kind man, Brinnan,
you take some pride in that.

699
00:40:57,591 --> 00:40:59,827
But this great favor,
I wonder,

700
00:40:59,961 --> 00:41:02,596
is it a kindness
or a manipulation?

701
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:06,367
If you're suddenly becoming wise
to the ways of the world,

702
00:41:06,499 --> 00:41:10,604
I would find that disturbing.

yes? Or no?

707
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:34,195
Anyway, he...
he put his head in my lap,

708
00:41:34,328 --> 00:41:38,566
like a child, and he said,
sotto voce...

709
00:41:38,699 --> 00:41:39,867
- Sotto voce?
- Oh, you understand sotto voce?

710
00:41:40,001 --> 00:41:42,169
Si, understand, understand.

711
00:41:42,303 --> 00:41:46,073
Yes... he, he said that
he loved me, and that

712
00:41:46,207 --> 00:41:51,645
I was beautiful, and that
we were going to get married.

713
00:41:51,779 --> 00:41:54,715

714

742
00:43:35,883 --> 00:43:39,588
Tell me, who's responsible?

743

Ah, well, I should be

Have you had some time
to read and...

748
00:43:55,436 --> 00:43:59,574
Um, I wouldn't say
that, no, not completely.

749
00:43:59,707 --> 00:44:01,642
Mm-hmm, of course.

750
00:44:01,775 --> 00:44:04,513
Um, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

If I could possibly have it
back, I found a typist

that can make another copy
of it and it would be very...

753
00:44:10,351 --> 00:44:13,821
You mean the copy you gave me
was the only copy.

754
00:44:13,954 --> 00:44:15,456
- Yes.
- The only copy...

there's another draft.

so very, very much

There are a few things

762

as the study of alcoholism.

763
00:44:43,184 --> 00:44:45,352
The thing about
an alcoholic's body

764
00:44:45,486 --> 00:44:51,258
is that rarely do we see
such a direct causality

765
00:44:51,392 --> 00:44:57,731
between an activity...
[cracking and slicing]

766
00:44:57,865 --> 00:45:01,168
...and its effect on physiology.
[student faints]

767
00:45:01,302 --> 00:45:07,841
First of all, alcohol causes
stomach secretions and...

768
00:45:07,975 --> 00:45:12,279
dilates the blood vessels
in the skin

769
00:45:12,413 --> 00:45:18,385
so that, though the drinker's
actually losing body heat,

770
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:21,956
he is feeling warm.

771
00:45:22,089 --> 00:45:25,793
The immediate effect
of alcohol,

772
00:45:25,926 --> 00:45:29,598
that which we like,
results from depression...

773
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:31,232
[student faints]
...of the nervous system,

774
00:45:31,365 --> 00:45:36,737
so there is a what feels like
a stimulant effect,

775
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:40,609
but actually, clinically,
that is because there is

776
00:45:40,741 --> 00:45:45,212
a depression in
the part of the brain

777
00:45:45,346 --> 00:45:48,415
that inhibits
our actions, so,

778
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:52,886
far from
loosening us up...

779
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:58,526
alcohol is depressing us,

780
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:02,796
one part of
the brain at a time.

with me, then?

Uncertainty whether the option
for anything better exists.

790
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:52,614
Lack of energy
to explore that option,

791
00:46:52,747 --> 00:46:55,617
and the hope that the option
with which we are stuck

792
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:59,486
might transmogrify
into something else.

793
00:47:03,758 --> 00:47:06,493

for everything else,

796

the window when we marry.

797
00:47:14,168 --> 00:47:17,672
We don't consider the investment
or the return or the downside.

We meet somebody,
we see them for a while and then

799
00:47:21,543 --> 00:47:24,845
we stay with forever,
or what feels like forever.

800

to shop.

01:14:05,780 --> 01:14:10,284
please, a single
syllable of your book.

1196
01:14:10,418 --> 01:14:12,420
I have no interest
whatsoever,

1197
01:14:12,553 --> 01:14:15,957
I have no prosaic
personality when I meet it.

1198
01:14:16,090 --> 01:14:18,125
I'm sure your pages, each
and everyone of them,

1199
01:14:18,259 --> 01:14:23,097
is filled and full
of your banalities.

1200
01:14:23,230 --> 01:14:25,733
It is your <i>métier.</i>

1201
01:14:41,949 --> 01:14:46,354
- Back again.
- Yes.

1202
01:14:46,486 --> 01:14:51,491
I thought you were just
a figment of his imagination.

1203
01:14:51,625 --> 01:14:55,663
Well, I am, but I'm not going
in there, it's disgusting.

1204
01:14:55,796 --> 01:15:01,836
[Dylan retching]
My God!

1205
01:15:01,969 --> 01:15:03,304
[softly]
Oh, good.

1206
01:15:03,437 --> 01:15:06,040
Severe, and such velocity.

1207
01:15:14,448 --> 01:15:17,151
[vomit splatters]

1208
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:20,821
Projectile vomiting,
probably caused

1209
01:15:20,955 --> 01:15:23,891
by pyloric muscle spasms.

1210
01:15:24,025 --> 01:15:27,895
Everyone's pretending...
you, me, him.

1211
01:15:28,029 --> 01:15:31,332
I mean, he doesn't
seem to care much.

1212
01:15:31,465 --> 01:15:34,335
About what?

1213
01:15:34,468 --> 01:15:37,071
About you.

1214
01:15:37,204 --> 01:15:41,242
No, someone, please,
I really can't ruin this jacket.

1215
01:15:41,375 --> 01:15:44,979
Someone, please?

1216
01:15:45,112 --> 01:15:47,516
Thank you.

1217
01:15:47,648 --> 01:15:50,151
[Dylan spitting and retching]

1218
01:15:54,388 --> 01:15:56,090
- And?
- What?

1219
01:15:56,223 --> 01:16:00,261
His sickness, the color
and the consistency.

1220
01:16:00,394 --> 01:16:02,096
Red and runny, mainly.

1221
01:16:02,229 --> 01:16:05,132
You know, you can't
trust your feelings with him.

1222
01:16:05,266 --> 01:16:07,101
I'm sorry... what?

1223
01:16:07,234 --> 01:16:10,071
I mean, we are, all of us,
drunk most of the time.

1224
01:16:10,204 --> 01:16:13,240
- No, no, I'm not drunk.
- I mean intoxicated.

1225
01:16:13,374 --> 01:16:15,309
Any time any of us
can feel something,

1226
01:16:15,443 --> 01:16:17,311
some unreasoned emotion.

1227
01:16:17,445 --> 01:16:20,247
- Do you know what?
- What?

1228
01:16:20,381 --> 01:16:22,551
Just because we feel something
doesn't mean it's real.

1229
01:16:22,683 --> 01:16:24,618
[snorts]
You should meet my husband.

1230
01:16:24,752 --> 01:16:28,589
- But it could be.
- No.

1231
01:16:31,192 --> 01:16:34,195
If I may demonstrate.

1232
01:16:59,787 --> 01:17:06,660
[tango playing on jukebox]

1233
01:17:12,666 --> 01:17:17,705
[tango music continues]

1234
01:18:05,386 --> 01:18:10,257
[tango music continues]

1235
01:18:35,783 --> 01:18:41,188
[tango music continues]

1236
01:18:44,291 --> 01:18:48,530
[music stops, panting]

1237
01:18:48,663 --> 01:18:52,833
Don't be so easy to be fooled
by the words or the world...

1238
01:18:52,967 --> 01:18:56,003
it's all a lie.

1239
01:18:56,136 --> 01:18:58,405
Everyone's a liar.

1240
01:19:09,283 --> 01:19:13,887
You don't speak any of
the Slavic languages, do you?

1241
01:19:14,021 --> 01:19:16,390
Why do you ask?

1242
01:19:16,524 --> 01:19:19,059
Out of curiosity.

1243
01:19:22,263 --> 01:19:25,266
Oh, well,
how's it look?

1244
01:19:25,399 --> 01:19:27,268
Brown and watery now.

1245
01:19:27,401 --> 01:19:28,936
Oh, that's bad.

1246
01:19:29,069 --> 01:19:31,272
- BRINNAN: Really?
- Mm-hmm, fecal vomiting.

1247
01:19:31,405 --> 01:19:34,775
Oh, God. Fecal?
It's really not.

1248
01:19:34,908 --> 01:19:36,777
Oh, I'm quite certain.

1249
01:19:36,910 --> 01:19:40,981
Some duodenal contractions
causing the bile to...

1250
01:19:41,115 --> 01:19:42,483
Do you mean
he's vomiting shit?

1251
01:19:42,617 --> 01:19:45,786
- Oh, my God.
- Exactly.

1252
01:19:49,390 --> 01:19:53,460
Now, look what
you've done.

1253
01:19:53,595 --> 01:19:56,330
I'm off.

1254
01:19:56,463 --> 01:20:01,368
Phone me if...
phone me.

1255
01:20:02,936 --> 01:20:07,207
[water flushing]

1256
01:20:10,244 --> 01:20:15,617
[chuckling]
Blood.

1257
01:20:15,750 --> 01:20:19,186
Blood, bloody blood!

1258
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:20,954
Blood.

1259
01:20:21,088 --> 01:20:23,824
Is it bloody blood...

1260
01:20:35,770 --> 01:20:39,106
God. Heh.

1261
01:20:39,239 --> 01:20:43,678
I don't envy the poor soldier
who has to clean that up.

1262
01:20:48,650 --> 01:20:53,487
Oh, well, we mustn't
dwell on these things.

1263
01:20:53,621 --> 01:20:57,391
Another drink, Carlos.

1264
01:21:01,362 --> 01:21:03,030
For God's sake,
let us sit on the ground

1265
01:21:03,163 --> 01:21:09,537
and tell sad stories of
the sad deaths of kings,

1266
01:21:09,671 --> 01:21:13,107
BOTH: ...for you have but
mistook me all this while...

1267
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:16,578
I live with bread
like you, feel want,

1268
01:21:16,711 --> 01:21:20,013
taste grief, need friends.

1269
01:21:20,147 --> 01:21:23,083
Subjected thus.

1270
01:21:23,217 --> 01:21:28,122
How can you say to me...
I am a king?

1271
01:21:32,993 --> 01:21:36,063
- You fuck.
- Pardon?

1272
01:21:36,196 --> 01:21:40,033
You, you fucking fuck.

1273
01:21:50,177 --> 01:21:54,047
Uh, M-mister Thomas?

1274
01:21:54,181 --> 01:21:55,249
If you're feeling better...

1275
01:21:55,382 --> 01:21:56,885
He needs to go
to the hospital.

1276
01:21:57,017 --> 01:21:59,953
I'm fine, Brinnan!

1277
01:22:00,087 --> 01:22:05,926
Just... the strangest
odd taste in my mouth...

1278
01:22:06,059 --> 01:22:09,631
If you're not feeling
well enough, your health is

1279
01:22:09,764 --> 01:22:12,567
the most important,
of course, if you're...

1280
01:22:12,700 --> 01:22:16,069
up to it, we should really,
we should go.

1281
01:22:19,774 --> 01:22:23,611
You are pure.

1282
01:22:23,745 --> 01:22:26,079
W-what?

1283
01:22:26,213 --> 01:22:28,949
No, I mean that, I...

1284
01:22:29,082 --> 01:22:33,086
I am jaded and...

1285
01:22:33,220 --> 01:22:40,895
a monster of sorts,
predatory, evil, lost.

1286
01:22:41,028 --> 01:22:45,567
You have a kindness
about you.

1287
01:22:45,700 --> 01:22:48,969
Thank you.

1288
01:22:49,102 --> 01:22:52,072
It is something about
the primal nature of man

1289
01:22:52,206 --> 01:22:57,344
that wants to destroy
innocence and kindness.

1290
01:22:57,478 --> 01:22:59,246
Why do you think
that is, Carlos?

1291
01:22:59,379 --> 01:23:00,648
CARLOS: I think you should
leave her alone.

1292
01:23:00,782 --> 01:23:04,284
Why do you think
that is, Penelope?

1293
01:23:07,789 --> 01:23:10,057
[spits]

1294
01:23:13,661 --> 01:23:16,965
TEDDY: Stop it!
FELIX: You bastard, Thomas!

1295
01:23:17,097 --> 01:23:19,567
Leave her alone.

1296
01:23:19,701 --> 01:23:22,670
Oh, my God, Dylan,
this is beneath you.

1297
01:23:25,105 --> 01:23:29,476
- I have no beneath.
FELIX: She's just a girl!

1298
01:23:35,482 --> 01:23:38,185
And what do you care
what I think or say?

1299
01:23:38,318 --> 01:23:42,022
It's a bad show,
old man, really bad.

1300
01:23:47,327 --> 01:23:50,063
You know all the tricks,
don't you, Mr. Thomas?

1301
01:23:50,197 --> 01:23:55,135
As do you,
Carlos, as do you.

1302
01:23:55,269 --> 01:23:58,305
I thought we were friends.

1303
01:23:58,438 --> 01:24:00,040
Did you?

1304
01:24:03,210 --> 01:24:05,680
Which college, then?

1305
01:24:09,551 --> 01:24:11,586
Columbia.

1306
01:24:11,719 --> 01:24:13,521
A fine institution.

1307
01:24:13,655 --> 01:24:16,223
Yeah, it was pretty good.

1308
01:24:16,356 --> 01:24:17,926
Writer?

1309
01:24:18,058 --> 01:24:21,629
You have something to say
to me, I think, Dylan!

1310
01:24:21,763 --> 01:24:23,965
Yes.

1311
01:24:24,097 --> 01:24:27,434
And my work, what do you
think of my work?

1312
01:24:31,338 --> 01:24:34,943
If I walk out of this bar,
Dylan, you're on your own.

1313
01:24:35,075 --> 01:24:37,946
Another drink, then?

1314
01:24:38,078 --> 01:24:41,549
Yes, another drink,
please, Carlos.

1315
01:24:41,683 --> 01:24:44,752
Happy to accommodate,
Dylan.

1316
01:24:44,886 --> 01:24:47,689
"Dylan" is it now?

1317
01:24:51,859 --> 01:24:55,095
Here you go.

1318
01:24:59,901 --> 01:25:04,271
Sixteen.

1319
01:25:04,404 --> 01:25:06,941
Sixteen is the small wisdom

1320
01:25:07,075 --> 01:25:12,914
we have acquired from
all the sound and fury.

1321
01:25:14,983 --> 01:25:19,754
Wisdom which comes only just
to provide peritectic service.

1322
01:25:22,557 --> 01:25:25,125
Small reward for all
that we have witnessed,

1323
01:25:25,258 --> 01:25:30,031
suffered and survived.

1324
01:25:43,911 --> 01:25:49,316
My work, man to man, writer
to writer, what do you think?

1325
01:25:49,449 --> 01:25:51,619
I can't imagine you would
care what I would think.

1326
01:25:51,753 --> 01:25:54,589
Oh, I care what
everyone thinks, Carlos.

1327
01:25:54,722 --> 01:25:59,694
Everyone...

1328
01:25:59,827 --> 01:26:01,729
Except for those of who
I've seduced,

1329
01:26:01,863 --> 01:26:05,198
whose judgement
I cannot trust.

1330
01:26:10,303 --> 01:26:13,440
John Malcolm?

1331
01:26:13,574 --> 01:26:16,044
Where is she?

1332
01:26:16,176 --> 01:26:19,847
Brinnan, look at the time.

1333
01:26:19,981 --> 01:26:23,518
Where is she?

1334
01:26:34,227 --> 01:26:36,931
[door opens and shuts]

1335
01:26:40,367 --> 01:26:43,503
Et tu, Felix?

1336
01:26:43,638 --> 01:26:45,740
You're cruel to watch,
old man.

1337
01:26:45,873 --> 01:26:47,407
But I'm rather fond of you.

1338
01:26:47,542 --> 01:26:49,544
Then don't
you want to save me?

1339
01:26:49,677 --> 01:26:51,713
No, not particularly.

1340
01:26:51,846 --> 01:26:54,247
I'm rather
in my own trouble.

1341
01:26:54,381 --> 01:26:57,185
See ya.

1342
01:26:57,317 --> 01:26:59,020
See you, then.

1343
01:26:59,153 --> 01:27:03,091
See you, Dylan,
knock 'em dead.

1344
01:27:03,223 --> 01:27:06,160
Thank you, Teddy.
[door shuts]

1345
01:27:06,293 --> 01:27:11,065
I will... knock them dead.

1346
01:27:23,376 --> 01:27:26,279
[door opens and shuts]

1347
01:27:33,253 --> 01:27:37,424
[whooshing, heartbeat]

1348
01:27:40,528 --> 01:27:44,799
[cars passing]

1349
01:27:44,932 --> 01:27:47,869
[sighing deeply]

1350
01:27:49,837 --> 01:27:53,373
Well, Carlos,
that was quite a day.

1351
01:27:53,508 --> 01:27:57,145
- For whom?
- For whom? For whom?

1352
01:27:57,277 --> 01:27:58,980
Very posh.

1353
01:27:59,113 --> 01:28:01,314
I meant, Dylan, whether you
were only thinking of what a day

1354
01:28:01,448 --> 01:28:04,585
it was for you, or what
it was for the others.

1355
01:28:04,719 --> 01:28:06,053
Pardon?

1356
01:28:06,187 --> 01:28:09,123
Oh, no, don't
look to me for pardon.

1357
01:28:09,257 --> 01:28:12,392
[register clangs shut]

1358
01:28:12,527 --> 01:28:14,629
Speechless now, are we?

1359
01:28:14,762 --> 01:28:16,931
No audience roaring
their meadow brow approval

1360
01:28:17,064 --> 01:28:20,333
of what they don't understand
but thinks sounds nice.

1361
01:28:20,467 --> 01:28:22,270
Like a replica painting they
bought at the five and dime,

1362
01:28:22,402 --> 01:28:24,038
mistaken for art.

1363
01:28:24,172 --> 01:28:29,877
Forgive me for seeming
self-pitying, Carlos, I...

1364
01:28:30,011 --> 01:28:32,613
I believe
I milked it all well.

1365
01:28:32,747 --> 01:28:34,882
You're not well,
you're right.

1366
01:28:35,016 --> 01:28:36,951
You're a walking ruin.

1367
01:28:37,084 --> 01:28:40,621
But you and I have our secret,
don't we, Dylan?

1368
01:28:40,755 --> 01:28:44,025
Do we, Carlos?

1369
01:28:44,158 --> 01:28:46,127
I would very much like
to know what that secret is,

1370
01:28:46,260 --> 01:28:50,698
but forgive me, like Captain
Oakes, I must be going now.

1371
01:28:50,832 --> 01:28:52,432
- Leaving, are we?
- Ahh...

1372
01:28:52,567 --> 01:28:55,870
Like the March Hare,
some important rendezvous?

1373
01:28:56,003 --> 01:28:58,973
To screw some naive girl who,
like the other lotus eaters,

1374
01:28:59,106 --> 01:29:04,111
mistake sound
for substance?

1375
01:29:06,681 --> 01:29:09,482
You fooled them all.

1376
01:29:09,617 --> 01:29:14,021
Please... you seem
displeased with me, Carlos,

1377
01:29:14,155 --> 01:29:16,891
I... I need your help.

1378
01:29:17,024 --> 01:29:23,197
Our secret, your secret,
is you know and I know...

1379
01:29:23,331 --> 01:29:25,733
there's nothing there.

1380
01:29:25,867 --> 01:29:30,538
Just a cadence of the language,
nothing else.

1381
01:29:30,671 --> 01:29:34,609
Not Auden, not Yeats.

1382
01:29:34,742 --> 01:29:37,879
- You're unkind.
- Unkind?

1383
01:29:38,012 --> 01:29:43,416
Tell that to that young girl,
that boy, your children,

1384
01:29:43,551 --> 01:29:46,220
and your friend
who finds you work.

1385
01:29:46,354 --> 01:29:49,090
Your wife, tell that
to your wife!

1386
01:29:49,223 --> 01:29:52,093
You think your self-destruction
is grand theater.

1387
01:29:52,226 --> 01:29:54,695
It's not, it's simply sad.

1388
01:29:54,829 --> 01:29:58,532
You're just a performer in your
own pathetic vaudeville show

1389
01:29:58,666 --> 01:30:01,269
with nothing of
importance to say.

1390
01:30:01,401 --> 01:30:04,772
- I write of life!
- You write of life?

1391
01:30:04,906 --> 01:30:07,440
You write of nothing.

1392
01:30:07,575 --> 01:30:11,112
The world you mourn
hasn't passed.

1393
01:30:11,245 --> 01:30:13,180
It never existed.

1394
01:30:13,314 --> 01:30:15,683
You should have looked at
and written about what is

1395
01:30:15,816 --> 01:30:20,087
actually here, around you,
oblique, stinking, rotting,

1396
01:30:20,221 --> 01:30:24,825
corrupt, pernicious, soulless
world on a darkling plain.

1397
01:30:24,959 --> 01:30:28,863
Our own ill-begotten monsters
slouching towards Bethlehem,

1398
01:30:28,996 --> 01:30:30,831
waiting to be born.

1399
01:30:30,965 --> 01:30:35,670
This is what poets
should write about.

1400
01:30:44,645 --> 01:30:49,517
You don't like my work,
then, I presume?

1401
01:30:49,650 --> 01:30:54,388
Perhaps yours is different,
I should... read it.

1402
01:30:54,522 --> 01:30:57,792
You'll forgive me if I don't
give you the only copy.

1403
01:30:57,925 --> 01:31:04,265
- Why do you work here, Carlos?
- Why?

1404
01:31:04,398 --> 01:31:05,933
- For you, Mr. Thomas.
- For me?

1405
01:31:06,067 --> 01:31:07,935
Oh, yes, Mr. Thomas.

1406
01:31:08,069 --> 01:31:13,174
For you, to help you
in the naming of drinks.

1407
01:31:13,307 --> 01:31:18,478
Here's one you
will not drink.

1408
01:31:18,612 --> 01:31:21,015
But I'll leave you
the bottle.

1409
01:31:26,954 --> 01:31:30,024
Ah, I must be going.

1410
01:31:30,157 --> 01:31:32,393
Close the door when
you leave, would you?

1411
01:31:41,168 --> 01:31:45,006
You know what tells
the whole story about you?

1412
01:31:45,139 --> 01:31:47,742
All this naming of drinks.

1413
01:31:47,875 --> 01:31:50,211
Each one of them
sounded so grand

1414
01:31:50,344 --> 01:31:56,684
and so thought out,
so clever.

1415
01:31:56,817 --> 01:32:01,022
But I can't remember
a single one.

1416
01:32:01,155 --> 01:32:04,525
Or could anyone
who was listening.

1417
01:32:04,658 --> 01:32:06,227
Nor can you.

1418
01:32:15,436 --> 01:32:18,039
That's what I mean.

1419
01:32:18,172 --> 01:32:20,908
We were remembering
parts of stuff,

1420
01:32:21,042 --> 01:32:23,978
the rest, is just noise.

1421
01:32:48,169 --> 01:32:51,238
They really are quite
easy to remember,

1422
01:32:51,372 --> 01:32:52,573
because there's
nothing to remember

1423
01:32:52,706 --> 01:32:55,709
except the experience
of a lived life.

1424
01:32:58,679 --> 01:33:02,183
First, and always first
is innocence,

1425
01:33:02,316 --> 01:33:04,752
which may last
a day or a lifetime.

1426
01:33:04,885 --> 01:33:09,056
And it's not a virtue
because it cannot be chosen.

1427
01:33:09,190 --> 01:33:15,396
Then enthusiasm, bright promise,
hope, recalcitrance, faith.

1428
01:33:15,530 --> 01:33:19,066
The mystical, the contemplation
of death, the crossing

1429
01:33:19,200 --> 01:33:24,972
of thresholds, the resurrection,
memory, regret...

1430
01:33:28,742 --> 01:33:32,847
...mere excess is eleven,

1431
01:33:32,980 --> 01:33:36,750
which is after ten...

1432
01:33:36,884 --> 01:33:39,820
is disappointment.

1433
01:33:39,954 --> 01:33:42,957
Twelve is the great sadness.

1434
01:33:43,090 --> 01:33:46,360
Thirteen is bravado,
titling Quixotically

1435
01:33:46,494 --> 01:33:48,696
at the failure of our lives.

1436
01:33:48,829 --> 01:33:53,033
Fourteen is the mere
servicing of our observers,

1437
01:33:53,167 --> 01:33:57,606
servicing our children
and our audiences,

1438
01:33:57,738 --> 01:34:00,774
contorting our hands
into shapes that throw

1439
01:34:00,908 --> 01:34:07,081
shadows on the wall, as if it
were a living thing.

1440
01:34:07,214 --> 01:34:09,950
Fifteen is the uncertainty
of what awaits us

1441
01:34:10,084 --> 01:34:13,420
when what awaits us
is not far off.

1442
01:34:13,555 --> 01:34:17,691
Sixteen, sixteen is
the small wisdom we've acquired

1443
01:34:17,825 --> 01:34:23,864
from all the sound and fury,
but late in peritectic service.

1444
01:34:27,569 --> 01:34:31,705
And 17...

1445
01:34:35,176 --> 01:34:40,481
Seventeen... is what we offer
ourselves in the absence

1446
01:34:40,615 --> 01:34:45,520
of enthusiasm, hope, faith,
recalcitrance, bravado,

1447
01:34:45,654 --> 01:34:47,556
wisdom, resurrection...

1448
01:34:47,688 --> 01:34:53,528
[flashes popping, shouting,
cheering, whooshing, heartbeat]

1449
01:34:58,165 --> 01:35:02,903
Seventeen is intoxication,
the absenting of ourselves

1450
01:35:03,037 --> 01:35:06,907
from all the noise
of the world.

1451
01:35:17,284 --> 01:35:20,487
[groaning]

1452
01:35:35,869 --> 01:35:38,772
[wincing]

1453
01:35:44,445 --> 01:35:46,648
And 18...

1454
01:35:50,918 --> 01:35:56,290
Eighteen is...

1455
01:36:00,761 --> 01:36:03,665
[liquor spills]

1456
01:36:15,009 --> 01:36:20,948
Dylan... Dylan, darling.

1457
01:36:21,081 --> 01:36:24,084
Dylan, wake up.

1458
01:36:24,218 --> 01:36:26,655
Where are you?

1459
01:36:30,224 --> 01:36:33,561
I'm at home.

1460
01:36:33,695 --> 01:36:36,631
Home.

1461
01:36:36,765 --> 01:36:38,966
That's a long way away.

1462
01:36:41,569 --> 01:36:47,941
Dylan, after all this...
after all this...

1463
01:36:48,075 --> 01:36:50,311
What is it that you love?

1464
01:36:53,814 --> 01:36:57,719
Home.

1465
01:36:57,851 --> 01:37:02,122
And me?

1466
01:37:02,256 --> 01:37:07,796
Love is a word so often used
it's lost all meaning.

1467
01:37:07,928 --> 01:37:13,467
When all the words we exchange
grow heavier with age,

1468
01:37:13,601 --> 01:37:17,504
like the stones
in Virginia Woolf's pocket.

1469
01:37:17,639 --> 01:37:20,608
The tired body and the heavy
stones dragging the mind

1470
01:37:20,742 --> 01:37:24,378
of the weary spirit to
the bottom of a drowning river.

1471
01:37:24,512 --> 01:37:26,614
Oh, Dylan.

1472
01:37:29,450 --> 01:37:33,854
So, no, I did not
love you, Caitlin.

1473
01:37:33,987 --> 01:37:36,691
You didn't?

1474
01:37:36,825 --> 01:37:41,228
So what remains
something else.

1475
01:37:41,362 --> 01:37:43,931
Vines wrapped around
a tree so tight

1476
01:37:44,064 --> 01:37:48,536
they strangle
as they nurture.

1477
01:37:48,670 --> 01:37:52,272
But we would not live
without the nurture.

1478
01:37:54,509 --> 01:37:56,845
Well, I loved you.

1479
01:37:56,977 --> 01:37:59,581
I do love you.

1480
01:37:59,714 --> 01:38:02,182
Our time apart would
leave me with an absence

1481
01:38:02,316 --> 01:38:06,721
I could not fathom
or quantify.

1482
01:38:06,855 --> 01:38:09,791
And your unfaithfulness
would ruin the viscera

1483
01:38:09,923 --> 01:38:12,527
of my interior
as a broadsword,

1484
01:38:12,660 --> 01:38:17,398
but your kindness was
my only harbor in a tempest

1485
01:38:17,532 --> 01:38:20,901
of daily apocalypses,
and the water torture

1486
01:38:21,034 --> 01:38:25,507
of the banality
of everyday life.

1487
01:38:25,640 --> 01:38:27,542
So what does that mean?

1488
01:38:27,675 --> 01:38:33,046
It means that what has passed
between us is a sacrament.

1489
01:38:33,180 --> 01:38:37,585
Nature is indifferent to us
and only we know how we matter

1490
01:38:37,719 --> 01:38:42,222
to one another, and yet it
cannot be measured

1491
01:38:42,356 --> 01:38:48,328
or spoken or quantified.

1492
01:38:48,462 --> 01:38:51,833
So I can say nothing else.

1493
01:39:02,710 --> 01:39:07,749
It was...
November third, 1953,

1494
01:39:07,882 --> 01:39:12,419
and Dylan staggered into
the Chelsea hotel, and he said,

1495
01:39:12,554 --> 01:39:17,291
"I've had 18 straight whiskeys,
I think this is a record."

1496
01:39:17,424 --> 01:39:20,961
[audience laughing]

1497
01:39:21,094 --> 01:39:25,567
A few hours later
he collapsed, he was taken

1498
01:39:25,700 --> 01:39:31,405
to St. Vincent in coma,
they looked in his throat

1499
01:39:31,539 --> 01:39:36,109
and saw that he was
drowning in mucus

1500
01:39:36,243 --> 01:39:39,246
and performed a tracheotomy.

1501
01:39:39,379 --> 01:39:43,283
He was still breathing
when she arrived, and she said

1502
01:39:43,417 --> 01:39:46,320
the oddest thing, she said,

1503
01:39:46,453 --> 01:39:49,791
"Is the bloody man
dead or alive?"

1504
01:39:49,924 --> 01:39:52,159
[audience laughs]

1505
01:39:56,731 --> 01:40:03,638
And, um... on November ninth
Dylan, Dylan died.

1506
01:40:11,813 --> 01:40:14,849
Are there any,
are there any questions?

1507
01:40:22,489 --> 01:40:27,662
"Do something!" he said.

1508
01:40:27,795 --> 01:40:32,667
And we threw all our snowballs
into the smoke...

1509
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:35,302
I think we missed Mr. Prothero...
and ran out of the house

1510
01:40:35,435 --> 01:40:37,839
to the telephone box.

1511
01:40:37,972 --> 01:40:40,008
"Let's call the police
as well," Jim said.

1512
01:40:40,140 --> 01:40:42,209
"And the ambulance.

1513
01:40:42,342 --> 01:40:46,748
And Ernie Jenkins,
he likes fires."

1514
01:40:46,881 --> 01:40:50,050
But we only called
the fire brigade, and soon

1515
01:40:50,183 --> 01:40:53,453
the fire engine came and three
tall men in helmets brought

1516
01:40:53,588 --> 01:40:56,223
a hose into the house
and Mr. Prothero got out

1517
01:40:56,356 --> 01:41:00,528
just in time, just before
they turned it on.

1518
01:41:03,230 --> 01:41:06,901
Nobody could have had
a noisier Christmas Eve.

1519
01:41:11,104 --> 01:41:12,974
And when the firemen
turned off the hose

1520
01:41:13,106 --> 01:41:15,242
and were standing
in the wet, smoky room,

1521
01:41:15,375 --> 01:41:18,546
Jim's Aunt, Miss Prothero,
came downstairs

1522
01:41:18,680 --> 01:41:23,618
and peered in at them.

1523
01:41:23,751 --> 01:41:25,520
Jim and I waited,
very quietly,

1524
01:41:25,653 --> 01:41:30,123
to hear what
she would say to them.

1525
01:41:30,257 --> 01:41:35,697
She said the right thing,
always.

1526
01:41:35,830 --> 01:41:37,765
She looked at
the three tall firemen

1527
01:41:37,899 --> 01:41:40,868
in their shining helmets,
standing among the smoke

1528
01:41:41,002 --> 01:41:44,072
and the cinders and the
dissolving snowballs,

1529
01:41:44,204 --> 01:41:50,979
and she said...

1530
01:41:51,111 --> 01:41:56,084
"Would you like
anything to read?"

1531
01:42:01,756 --> 01:42:07,662
♪♪

1532
01:43:35,817 --> 01:43:37,819
I will talk
about him later,

1533
01:43:37,952 --> 01:43:40,420
everyone wants
to talk about him,

1534
01:43:40,555 --> 01:43:44,926
but I have other stories,
you know.

1535
01:43:45,059 --> 01:43:47,528
When I was in
medical school, of course,

1536
01:43:47,662 --> 01:43:50,363
we worked very hard,

1537
01:43:50,497 --> 01:43:53,101
but we still knew how
to have a good time.

1538
01:43:53,233 --> 01:43:56,369
[laughing]

1539
01:43:56,503 --> 01:44:00,141
There was a woman in our class,
I think she was the only one,

1540
01:44:00,273 --> 01:44:05,113
we were in the second year
doing anatomy, and we used to,

1541
01:44:05,245 --> 01:44:11,418
we used to cut the penis off
one of the cadavers

1542
01:44:11,552 --> 01:44:13,988
and leave it
in her lab coat.

1543
01:44:14,122 --> 01:44:16,456
[laughing]

1544
01:44:16,591 --> 01:44:17,959
So, you see, later,

1545
01:44:18,092 --> 01:44:21,662
when she would put
the hand in the pocket,

1546
01:44:21,796 --> 01:44:24,766
she would pull out a penis.

1547
01:44:24,899 --> 01:44:30,238
[laughing]

1548
01:44:30,370 --> 01:44:33,306
And the Swiss
are always funny.

1549
01:44:33,440 --> 01:44:36,911
Some jokes, after a while,
aren't funny anymore,

1550
01:44:37,044 --> 01:44:43,416
but a penis in the pocket,
always funny, always...

1551
01:44:43,551 --> 01:44:49,090
[men laughing]
...fresh, so we...

1552
01:44:49,223 --> 01:44:53,261
I used to do this two
or three times a week.

1553
01:44:53,393 --> 01:44:57,098
We were running out of
penises.

1554
01:44:57,231 --> 01:44:58,699
What became of her?

1555
01:44:58,833 --> 01:45:02,003
She became a urologist,
I would like to think

1556
01:45:02,136 --> 01:45:07,108
I contributed
to her career choice.

1557
01:45:07,241 --> 01:45:10,477
And a lesbian.

1558
01:45:10,611 --> 01:45:12,613
Yes, and I wondered if I might
not have contributed

1559
01:45:12,747 --> 01:45:15,016
to that as well.

1560
01:45:15,149 --> 01:45:18,953
But later, one of my friends
from medical school

1561
01:45:19,086 --> 01:45:23,658
told me that she said it wasn't
the pricks in her pocket,

1562
01:45:23,791 --> 01:45:28,529
but the pricks in her class.
[laughing]

1563
01:45:31,232 --> 01:45:35,269
That had cleared up any doubts
she may have had.

1564
01:45:35,402 --> 01:45:39,339
Apparently, always,
that way inclined still,

1565
01:45:39,472 --> 01:45:42,810
pricks in a pocket...
it's funny just saying that.

1566
01:45:42,944 --> 01:45:47,548
[laughing]

1567
01:45:47,682 --> 01:45:50,483
How reassuring.

1568
01:45:50,618 --> 01:45:52,820
Reassuring?

1569
01:45:52,954 --> 01:45:55,523
Well, that my husband
is in the caring hands

1570
01:45:55,656 --> 01:45:57,658
of a sensitive physician.

1571
01:45:57,792 --> 01:46:00,761
Oh, just because
I've a sense of humor

1572
01:46:00,895 --> 01:46:03,764
doesn't make me
a bad doctor.

1573
01:46:09,337 --> 01:46:11,438
So what does make you
a bad doctor?

1574
01:46:11,572 --> 01:46:13,074
Oh, I'm not
certain, really,

1575
01:46:13,207 --> 01:46:17,245
either my lack of attention
or my lack of caring.
