1
00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:28,709
I will see you later

2
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:33,407
Look at a person when you greet them

3
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:34,920
And you call yourself a man?

4
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:19,057
Why, you brat!

5
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:25,166
Mom, do you have some money?

6
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,968
I'm supposed to go to
the movies with a friend...

7
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:30,569
Damn. I just wanna see
a movie, dammit.

8
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:46,690
Hey, hey, Chang-Guk!

9
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,097
Watcha looking at?

10
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:45,474
I want playboy, you got it?

11
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:46,671
I got it

12
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:50,883
9 dollar, 9 dollar

13
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:11,096
Why are you so late!

14
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:46,771
What are you doing?

15
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,728
Looks about 30 pounds, 30
Load it up

16
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:25,940
Oh, give me one more!

17
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:28,640
After I bone it
it'll only be 20 pounds
I'm being generous, as it is

18
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:32,141
Move your ass over

19
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:05,981
Pull! Pull it you dumbass!

20
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,482
Pull it you dumbass!

21
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:22,830
Hey, you do it!

22
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,629
Fucking moron!

23
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:38,942
Light the burner and bring it in!

24
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,458
Enjoy your stew!

25
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:00,062
Oh, you're here?

26
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,466
How much?

27
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,461
What do you mean, how much?
Just give me the usual

28
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:06,471
Okay

29
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:26,825
Look! It does mean pleasure

30
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:32,130
Hey, then look up this one

31
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:35,531
O. R. G. A. N. I. Z. E

32
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:02,453
What are you doing?
Squeeze some more yellow paint

33
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:36,219
It got returned again

34
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:39,425
It's not like you've sent one or two
Why not stop sending them now?

35
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,498
Welcome

36
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:35,113
Where are the canned mackerels?

37
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:40,015
What?

38
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:41,924
Canned mackerels... where are they?

39
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:45,125
There aren't any!
Not for sale!

40
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:47,227
Why not?

41
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:50,429
This is Korea! Speak in Korean!

42
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:54,437
I'll be in the U. S. Soon enough!

43
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:55,735
Where are they?
Hurry up and give it!

44
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,538
Get out! I won't sell to you!

45
00:12:57,576 --> 00:13:02,445
Get out! Get out! Not for sale!
Get out already!

46
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:04,841
You pushing me?

47
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:08,843
Don't you be twisting
your tongue around here!
You gonna get out?

48
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:16,061
You bitch!

49
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:28,269
Of all the rotten... rotten luck!

50
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:39,170
Bastard...

51
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,975
you weren't like this
when you were a boy

52
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:44,881
You learned English well...

53
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:46,680
listened to your mom...

54
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,084
Shut up, you whore!

55
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:52,881
Before I stomp you to death!

56
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:03,795
Told you to stop this craziness!

57
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:08,106
Damn bastard!

58
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:14,010
I was wrong! Stop it!
Please stop! Chang-Guk!

59
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,248
He hit you again?

60
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:30,846
The rotten bastard!

61
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:34,252
Don't you call my son a bastard!

62
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,757
You're probably the only woman
who gets beat up by her brat...

63
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:39,664
I told you I'd make sure it
never happened again!

64
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:41,666
You hit my son
and I'll kill you!

65
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:46,668
Let me see...

66
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:50,970
Dammit!

67
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,643
You, you wanna become like me, too?

68
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:43,056
Ma'am!

69
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:46,157
Here's your monthly pension
Please give me your stamp

70
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:52,561
You're lucky to have
such an honorable father...

71
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:56,270
Did your father die
in the Baekma-Goji Battle?

72
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,470
Doesn't that bother you?

73
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:03,072
Your brother shot you
with a toy gun, right?

74
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:06,484
Let me see
Let's see how bad it is

75
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:13,791
It's not enough to take my eye
you gotta cripple my dog, too?

76
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:16,217
Why do you leave it anywhere?

77
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:19,226
And! Why is your eye my fault?

78
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,027
We were both playing!

79
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:22,431
Who said to move?

80
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:25,028
And you can still see
fine out of one eye!

81
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,038
You two fight all the time!

82
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:28,232
Dammit

83
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:33,445
Where did your husband die?

84
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:34,639
At the Fight of Nakdong River?

85
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,147
Many died there too...

86
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:38,547
I don't know
They'd have to find the body first!

87
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:41,052
Whew! What are you going to do
about your daughter's eye?

88
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:43,554
They could fix it
at the American Military Hospital...

89
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:45,554
If you're finished, leave!

90
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:48,458
I feel bad for your daughter
that's all. She has her
whole life ahead of her...

91
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:11,077
Whenever I hold an arrow
I remember the war

92
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:24,417
At the Battle of Nakdong River
we fought with a North squadron

93
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:27,023
I shot three of them dead!

94
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,430
So why didn't you get a medal?

95
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:32,437
Exactly

96
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:35,831
That's why the government's
screwed up!

97
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:41,244
They don't give to them who
deserve it. But them cowards
at the rear they get one!

98
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,542
Take a look at this!

99
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:46,148
For this service all

100
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,846
I get is a measly
30 dollars a month

101
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,749
That's disgusting!
Pull it down, quick!

102
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:56,955
What's wrong?
This is as good as a medal...

103
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:59,463
Fuck!
You think anyone gets a medal?

104
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:03,067
Arrogant asshole!

105
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:06,559
You who come from licking
Yankee asses...

106
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:09,271
Still, I've never killed anyone!

107
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:13,677
Whenever you open
your mouth it's the war

108
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,806
Are you so proud of killing
three men of our same blood?
Tell me!

109
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:18,516
Sergeant Kim!

110
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,610
Are you so proud of shooting
three men dead?

111
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:26,223
Bastard, don't even know who's
on top and who's at the bottom!

112
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:28,819
That's why you always
have dog blood on your hands!

113
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:34,826
Sure! Let's see
if you don't sell your mutt to me!

114
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:38,429
Care to lay some money down?

115
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,038
Who's betting at this
sacred archery field?

116
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:43,441
You're talking shit!

117
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:46,842
In the old days, a butcher
like you wouldn't be
allowed to shoot arrows!

118
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:50,245
Only wealthy farmers could!

119
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:51,544
Times have gotten better...

120
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,643
even a meat-hacking bastard
gets to shoot arrows...

121
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:56,654
God-dammit! A meat-hacker!

122
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:58,246
You done talking?

123
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,053
You guys have to fight
every time you meet?

124
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,457
That's enough, people

125
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:03,256
You want to see me grab
a dog right now?

126
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:06,059
Patience, got to be patient

127
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,861
Just let him be

128
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:11,858
He's asking for it! Shit!
All he's got is that dingy pride of his

129
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,469
You gonna play a game?

130
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:17,103
You go first!

131
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:57,315
Really?

132
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,617
Yes

133
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:03,712
Will you be quiet!

134
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,717
What are you doing undressed?
Crazy bitch!

135
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:47,187
Mom! Did you see my puppy?

136
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:48,290
Don't know!

137
00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:57,909
Hey, Jihum

138
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:04,409
About this big... its fur is white

139
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:06,314
with some black mixed in...

140
00:23:07,652 --> 00:23:10,018
Little shmucks, at it already!

141
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,920
Go home now!

142
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:31,237
Anyone here?

143
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:32,243
Welcome

144
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:34,438
We're here to sell this dog
We found it on the street

145
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:36,344
I don't need such young...

146
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:38,144
I don't take puppies

147
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:39,343
Take it away

148
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:44,051
Students stealing puppies...

149
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:52,162
Shit! Even if it's a puppy
it's still dog meat
why won't she buy it?

150
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:54,960
Let's kill it ourselves
and then sell it

151
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,466
Then she won't know it's a puppy!

152
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:00,163
Get over here!

153
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:02,473
Get over here!

154
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:14,283
What... dammit!

155
00:26:17,642 --> 00:26:20,202
Who said to look at girls?

156
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,110
It's because of guys like
you we soldiers get a bum wrap!

157
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:25,605
That's right, asshole!
I can't get used to it here
I think I'll go crazy without a woman!

158
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:27,413
Yeah
I got a problem with that

159
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:28,714
There is a problem

160
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:31,620
You think I want to be here?
I'm doing my part for world peace

161
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:33,021
World peace?

162
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:35,117
Who thinks like that?

163
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,321
Probably just us Americans

164
00:26:43,668 --> 00:26:44,726
Hey, come over here

165
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:48,728
If you don't come
I'll kill you

166
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:49,637
Do you like coke?

167
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:52,231
Hey, you do it!

168
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:57,239
You dick!

169
00:27:57,275 --> 00:28:00,142
You think I like doing this?

170
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:04,046
Why'd you hit
my girlfriend yesterday?

171
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:09,247
That bastard! Hey!

172
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:16,590
Don't you run!

173
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:22,295
Asshole! See if you don't come back!

174
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:32,600
What are you doing?
Get back to work, now!

175
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:43,621
What the hell? Get out of here!

176
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:46,715
Get out of here!
Get back to work, now!

177
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:06,841
Get out of here!

178
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,137
Get out of here! Bastard

179
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,580
I won't use the likes of you!

180
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:02,428
Hey, that's enough!

181
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:07,132
You're going to hurt the meat!

182
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:09,237
Come here!

183
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:18,773
Stupid moron, that's the way
you should have done it!

184
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,284
Then I wouldn't have hit you so much!
Here, have a swig

185
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:22,279
Here, have a swig

186
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:34,392
To be a dog dealer
you gotta outstare them!

187
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:38,198
When a dog looks straight at you
it's scary, right?

188
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:41,105
You know what the scariest
eyeball of them all is?

189
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,605
It's the human eye

190
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:49,613
You know why the dogs
look away from me?

191
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:53,308
Because there's fire in my eyes

192
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:54,613
Here look!

193
00:30:58,957 --> 00:31:00,618
Hey, you want to go to your
father's land, don't you?

194
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:09,633
Answer in English...

195
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:15,569
You bastard, your mother
taught you English by beating
it into you, didn't she?

196
00:31:21,112 --> 00:31:23,080
To speak good English
no good thing

197
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:26,279
You gotta do everything those
Yankees tell you to, everything

198
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:27,380
Everything!

199
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:33,887
You hit my girlfriend one more time

200
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:38,989
She's your mom but
she's my girlfriend!

201
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,395
From before you were born!

202
00:31:46,337 --> 00:31:48,601
Look at me like Dog-Eye!

203
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:56,910
Stop looking at me!
My eye's about to explode!

204
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:39,782
Hey

205
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:42,592
come over here, stupid

206
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:53,603
You hear what I'm saying?

207
00:32:56,841 --> 00:33:00,106
If I went to school
I'd be two grades ahead of you

208
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:03,705
But you don't, moron!
What do you know better than us?

209
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,707
Okay, I'll ask you in English
so answer back in English

210
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:11,616
You want to go to school, too, huh?

211
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:15,123
He asked if you wanted
to go to school!

212
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:18,125
What's your dream?

213
00:33:19,063 --> 00:33:21,429
What do you want to be?

214
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:26,327
This is for being so dumb, got it?

215
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:28,339
Answer!

216
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:29,931
Got it?

217
00:33:29,974 --> 00:33:30,633
Uh-huh

218
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:34,444
With respect!

219
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:36,439
Yes

220
00:33:49,894 --> 00:33:52,260
We're not taking
your money we're exchanging
it with an English textbook!

221
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:57,861
Give me some more!
What did you do?

222
00:33:57,902 --> 00:33:59,767
Tell me! Fuckin'I outta...

223
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:03,371
What are you guys doing?

224
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:06,376
Oh, hey, cross-breed!

225
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,373
Say it again!

226
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:24,923
If they do that again, tell me

227
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:28,629
What's this?

228
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:38,740
Have you ever seen
a naked girl in person?

229
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:49,653
This is boring!

230
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:53,256
She's not undressing!

231
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:55,648
Are you ok?
Look at me!

232
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:06,261
It's okay. Look, you got
a little cut, that's all

233
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:10,155
How could she poke me
with a pencil? Oh, it hurts

234
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:10,963
Does it hurt a lot?

235
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:18,904
Shit! I'm going home

236
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:40,928
Having fun?

237
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:52,634
I guess you saw me naked
like these pictures... even

238
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:59,042
playing... with my puppy

239
00:37:01,285 --> 00:37:03,651
You saw what the puppy did...

240
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:11,252
I felt weird

241
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:17,000
Just like dogs, right?

242
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:47,719
Get up, you bastard!

243
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:34,001
It's a gun!

244
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:39,207
Shoot it!

245
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:43,612
Do it! You don't have the guts
Shoot it! Let see you!

246
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:22,376
Hey!

247
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:26,587
You going home?

248
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:29,392
Yes

249
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:30,985
Do you want something to eat?

250
00:40:33,063 --> 00:40:34,052
No?

251
00:40:39,737 --> 00:40:40,396
Eat up! Eat up!

252
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:47,008
Can you pull your hair back once?

253
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:53,316
I'm not making fun of you

254
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:56,615
I just want to see
if it can be fixed
Pull your hair back

255
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:25,382
Why did you run?

256
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:27,584
Who ran away?
I needed to take a leak!

257
00:41:27,618 --> 00:41:30,382
You think we American
soldiers are dogs, sir?
To take a leak anywhere?

258
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:32,981
Something's fishy here
I exercise the right to
inspect your things

259
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:34,684
Inspect? What did I do?

260
00:41:35,626 --> 00:41:37,685
We're on alert these
days because of drugs
Please cooperate

261
00:41:37,728 --> 00:41:39,286
Drugs? Sure. Go ahead

262
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,195
I'm sorry

263
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:43,200
How old are you?

264
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:44,599
Eighteen

265
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:46,095
Go home

266
00:41:46,136 --> 00:41:47,398
You bastard!

267
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:48,803
Go! Now!

268
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:51,808
Wait!

269
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:56,006
Eighteen is still
underage in Korea!

270
00:41:56,046 --> 00:41:58,105
Don't soil the honor
of the world's greatest
American army

271
00:41:58,148 --> 00:42:00,013
What the hell?

272
00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:02,912
Wait!

273
00:43:18,662 --> 00:43:21,324
Eunok, walk straight!

274
00:43:27,371 --> 00:43:30,238
Eunok, what's wrong with you?
Have you been drinking?

275
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:33,137
Eunok!

276
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:50,021
What's wrong with you?

277
00:44:03,073 --> 00:44:04,335
Why you brat...

278
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:15,179
35 pounds!

279
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:17,683
Is that all?

280
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:20,281
He's at least 40 pounds
Try weighing him again

281
00:44:21,725 --> 00:44:23,989
Forget it! You should be thankful
I'm buying your mutt

282
00:44:25,129 --> 00:44:27,495
Uh, okay. What a temper...

283
00:44:27,531 --> 00:44:28,691
Load it up!

284
00:45:14,478 --> 00:45:15,877
What are you doing, stupid!
Get it in the noose!

285
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:24,177
Um... could we maybe
let this one live?
He's my friend's dog...

286
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:27,088
Talking dog-shit, you bastard
Hurry up with that noose, you dick!

287
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:34,089
Go!

288
00:45:36,433 --> 00:45:37,798
Why that bastard!

289
00:46:17,808 --> 00:46:23,474
Get over here, you bastard!
You got any sense in ya, dickhead?

290
00:47:31,815 --> 00:47:34,283
You! Stop right there!

291
00:48:15,692 --> 00:48:17,660
Hey, Dog-Eye!

292
00:48:17,694 --> 00:48:23,064
The dog's here lying dead
in our yard. Hurry over!

293
00:49:00,537 --> 00:49:01,504
Where did you bury it
you moron?

294
00:49:04,041 --> 00:49:07,499
Where did you bury it?
Tell me now, you moron!

295
00:49:08,145 --> 00:49:09,510
I don't have the money
to pay it back

296
00:49:09,546 --> 00:49:11,514
so where is it buried? Dammit!

297
00:49:55,926 --> 00:49:56,893
Hey!

298
00:50:01,932 --> 00:50:05,095
What are you looking at?
You're in training! Move ahead

299
00:50:05,135 --> 00:50:05,897
Shit!

300
00:50:21,084 --> 00:50:22,745
That crazy bastard...

301
00:50:34,998 --> 00:50:35,760
Good work

302
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:41,864
Do some work! Some work!

303
00:52:06,223 --> 00:52:07,884
What are you doing?
Get back to work?

304
00:52:09,025 --> 00:52:10,390
Dammit! You think being manager
makes you God?

305
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:11,394
What!

306
00:52:11,528 --> 00:52:12,552
Move! Move!

307
00:52:14,865 --> 00:52:16,332
Do some work! Some work!

308
00:52:44,194 --> 00:52:45,252
No trouble, okay?

309
00:52:58,108 --> 00:52:59,166
Hey!

310
00:53:05,115 --> 00:53:06,082
Hi

311
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:28,800
There's one missing
Did you take it?

312
00:53:32,242 --> 00:53:33,209
How'd you like it?

313
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:35,102
Felt good, huh?

314
00:53:38,348 --> 00:53:39,610
Hey!

315
00:53:41,651 --> 00:53:42,413
You want a lift?

316
00:53:44,154 --> 00:53:46,418
It's okay. Come on!

317
00:54:13,183 --> 00:54:16,675
That bastard, you rotten son
of a bitch! Where are you
going, with a baby? Bastard

318
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,385
What? We're just riding a bike
What's the matter?

319
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:21,788
You think I don't know
what you are?

320
00:54:21,825 --> 00:54:23,793
Pretend to be nice and
then eat her up!

321
00:54:24,227 --> 00:54:27,196
I served three years
at Camp Carol

322
00:54:28,131 --> 00:54:30,497
Eunok, do you want to
end up like Chang-Guk's mom?

323
00:54:30,533 --> 00:54:32,398
Hurry up and go home!

324
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:49,711
What are you saying now?
You can't give me our pension?

325
00:54:49,753 --> 00:54:53,211
By any chance, have you heard
from Mr. Wonil Jang?

326
00:54:53,256 --> 00:54:55,315
How can I hear from
a dead person?

327
00:54:55,358 --> 00:55:00,421
You see... actually
they say Wonil Jang
didn't die in the war

328
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:01,725
that he's alive in North Korea

329
00:55:01,765 --> 00:55:05,826
It's been confirmed
that Wonil Jang voluntarily
went to the North...

330
00:55:05,869 --> 00:55:07,336
Voluntarily went to the North?!

331
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:14,842
So what we're saying is
if Wonil Jang comes here
quickly report it to this man

332
00:55:14,878 --> 00:55:18,974
And in the future, if you leave
the village even for a day, please
report to us Your children, too

333
00:55:19,015 --> 00:55:21,483
Are you keeping an eye on us?
The family of a soldier
who received a medal of merit?

334
00:55:21,518 --> 00:55:24,783
You're no longer a family
of a merited soldier but
a soldier who defected to the North

335
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:28,279
It's 180 degrees different
Keep this in mind...

336
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:29,792
we're always watching you...

337
00:55:30,927 --> 00:55:33,691
Please return the medal and
certificate of merit by
tomorrow, please

338
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:41,201
Don't cry
They say father's alive!

339
00:55:41,237 --> 00:55:44,695
What use is he alive now?
What are we going to live on?

340
00:55:44,741 --> 00:55:46,402
Damn! Why take it out on me?

341
00:55:53,249 --> 00:55:56,218
You... what's wrong with you?
What's wrong?

342
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:02,519
Who's the bastard?
Tell me now!

343
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,218
Look at me!

344
00:56:15,505 --> 00:56:16,472
Come here, bastard!

345
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:26,672
You, you, you...
Hey, asshole, get up

346
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:02,713
Go in. Go in, now

347
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:27,774
Do you have some money?

348
00:57:33,416 --> 00:57:37,682
Hey! They're hiring over in the
next village female factory workers
to make underwear for American soldiers

349
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:41,488
Watcha gonna do at home?
You got kicked out of school anyway

350
00:57:41,524 --> 00:57:44,084
Oh! Get out! Get out and die
you worthless-!

351
00:57:45,929 --> 00:57:46,691
Dammit!

352
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:28,869
They're commie bastards
who got executed during the war!

353
00:58:31,107 --> 00:58:35,373
They're small, small commies
These bastards

354
00:58:35,411 --> 00:58:38,380
these bastards did this to my leg!

355
00:58:39,916 --> 00:58:42,282
Is there anything else?

356
00:58:42,318 --> 00:58:44,183
Look here

357
00:58:49,726 --> 00:58:51,887
Look here, shouldn't you
report that to the police?

358
00:58:52,729 --> 00:58:56,290
Report whatever... this rusty thing?

359
00:58:58,134 --> 00:59:01,695
Take the bones already and
bury them by the river!

360
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:06,499
I thought the water
in our well was tasty...

361
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:09,011
You know They say
rotting corpses make
the water taste good!

362
00:59:15,084 --> 00:59:17,245
- Clean this up!
- Yeah
