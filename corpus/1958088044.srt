1
00:02:28,001 --> 00:02:30,141
They thought about everything they'd been through.

2
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:32,213
The perilous swamp, the treacherous

3
00:02:32,237 --> 00:02:34,887
tower, the darkness of rainbow caverns.

4
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,000
They stood together, exhausted from their adventure.

5
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:40,000
Rex stared in her eyes for a long time.

6
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,953
Then his great green lips curled sadly back from his fangs,

7
00:02:42,978 --> 00:02:44,632
and his voice was soft as he said.

8
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:47,480
It's too bad it couldn't have worked out between us.

9
00:02:47,574 --> 00:02:49,806
But at least we'll always have Tar Town.

10
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,640
You gotta to be pulling my tail.

11
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,840
That's your idea of a dinosaur story.

12
00:02:58,593 --> 00:02:59,566
Let me see that.

13
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:02,793
It's my story, and it's a serious artistic statement, okay?

14
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:09,366
Arachnophobia alert.

15
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,439
Spiders where?

16
00:03:11,006 --> 00:03:12,318
Timmy, you brat.

17
00:03:12,343 --> 00:03:13,233
Made you look.

18
00:03:13,258 --> 00:03:14,258
See what else is in here.

19
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:18,000
Timmy, don't! Give it back crater face!

20
00:03:18,001 --> 00:03:22,800
Dear diary, oh, I am so in love with Mick.

21
00:03:22,825 --> 00:03:25,625
He's almost as handsome as Rex.

22
00:03:26,298 --> 00:03:28,415
- Jamie.
- I swear he's making it up.

23
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:32,513
- Oh, would I wouldn't give just the hold his..
- Timmy?

24
00:03:33,001 --> 00:03:34,000
hand.

25
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:35,240
Hey, let me see that.

26
00:03:35,265 --> 00:03:37,264
Hey, hey, no, please.

27
00:03:37,289 --> 00:03:38,288
Ow.

28
00:03:42,193 --> 00:03:44,000
Hey, these are just dinosaur stories.

29
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,753
You little horn head.

30
00:03:47,862 --> 00:03:49,787
Program dimensional access.

31
00:03:50,443 --> 00:03:51,793
Primary power on.

32
00:03:52,393 --> 00:03:53,392
Check.

33
00:03:55,633 --> 00:03:58,279
Hey, code orange.

34
00:03:59,788 --> 00:04:00,787
Check.

35
00:04:01,822 --> 00:04:02,622
Remote access.

36
00:04:03,281 --> 00:04:04,280
Check.

37
00:04:17,067 --> 00:04:18,606
- Goggles.
- Goggles

38
00:04:26,444 --> 00:04:27,394
Ready?

39
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,439
Ready.

40
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,486
Oh.

41
00:05:02,334 --> 00:05:03,480
Oh, my God.

42
00:05:04,799 --> 00:05:06,493
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my.

43
00:05:06,518 --> 00:05:07,557
Oh, Dana.

44
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:11,806
Oh.

45
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,200
We've done it.

46
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:22,506
You got the new tape?

47
00:05:22,619 --> 00:05:23,976
Dude, volcanic!

48
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,219
Come on, Tim, put it on.

49
00:05:25,447 --> 00:05:27,746
As long as you apes, remember who's in charge here.

50
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,366
- Okay. Here it comes, here it comes.

51
00:05:37,425 --> 00:05:38,313
Yeah.

52
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,560
This is the best.

53
00:07:10,213 --> 00:07:12,113
THUNDERIN'!!!!

54
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:22,468
See, Jamie, you're going to be a real writer. this is what you gotta write

55
00:07:22,493 --> 00:07:24,980
You know, Dinosaurs is about this really awesome world

56
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,193
where your friends are saurs..

57
00:07:26,218 --> 00:07:29,270
who will take a chunk out of anybody who skates ya.

58
00:07:29,673 --> 00:07:31,666
- We've broken the laws of time and space.
- Yes!

59
00:07:33,133 --> 00:07:34,733
We've made history..

60
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,140
Oh, It's so beautiful.

61
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,879
Splendid.

62
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:44,000
Here, send it out for molecular test today.

63
00:07:44,772 --> 00:07:46,652
10 points over the time.

64
00:07:47,413 --> 00:07:48,586
10?

65
00:07:48,586 --> 00:07:49,466
Oh, my God!

66
00:07:49,733 --> 00:07:50,150
Gil!

67
00:07:50,175 --> 00:07:51,666
Our plane leaves at 10!

68
00:07:51,691 --> 00:07:54,690
The conference on inter-dimensional physics. Remember?

69
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,726
Oh! Right!

70
00:07:58,469 --> 00:07:59,719
Wait a minute.

71
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,720
Dana, it's perfect.

72
00:08:02,806 --> 00:08:03,893
We've got the data.

73
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:05,099
We've got the proof.

74
00:08:05,314 --> 00:08:06,313
Right.

75
00:08:06,338 --> 00:08:07,337
Right.

76
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:09,379
It'll be the dissertation they'll never forget.

77
00:08:09,404 --> 00:08:10,772
They said it couldn't be done.

78
00:08:10,797 --> 00:08:11,796
We can just make it.

79
00:08:11,821 --> 00:08:12,526
Okay.

80
00:08:12,808 --> 00:08:14,153
- We leave everything set up.
- Uh-huh.

81
00:08:14,178 --> 00:08:17,160
And then when we get back, you'll be ready for the final test.

82
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,161
Sending a living being!

83
00:08:20,326 --> 00:08:23,120
We have twelve minutes and five seconds to pack.

84
00:08:23,145 --> 00:08:23,726
Right.

85
00:08:23,751 --> 00:08:24,750
Gil..

86
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,260
Hurry.

87
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:26,546
Right.

88
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm gonna get you, saur.

89
00:08:52,001 --> 00:08:53,000
Hey, kids.

90
00:08:53,001 --> 00:08:54,000
What's going on?

91
00:08:54,856 --> 00:08:57,168
Oh, you guys are gonna ruin your eyes

92
00:09:00,481 --> 00:09:02,780
- If they weren't already ruined.
- That better?

93
00:09:03,488 --> 00:09:04,487
Sunshine.

94
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:07,786
A Sunday morning.

95
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,000
You know, it's a beautiful day outside.

96
00:09:10,001 --> 00:09:11,320
You two should be out enjoying it.

97
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,079
Dad.

98
00:09:13,214 --> 00:09:14,500
It's Saturday.

99
00:09:14,943 --> 00:09:16,473
And there's three of us.

100
00:09:16,653 --> 00:09:17,780
Hm? Oh.

101
00:09:17,805 --> 00:09:18,804
So there are.

102
00:09:18,829 --> 00:09:19,828
Hello, Dick.

103
00:09:20,925 --> 00:09:22,000
It's Mick.

104
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:24,000
Right.

105
00:09:25,319 --> 00:09:26,652
- Hi, Jamie.
- Hi, Mick.

106
00:09:26,676 --> 00:09:28,549
Timmy, may I see you a second, please?

107
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:29,354
Sure.

108
00:09:29,629 --> 00:09:30,628
Thank you.

109
00:09:33,232 --> 00:09:35,599
You kids wouldn't believe what we accomplished in the lab today.

110
00:09:36,126 --> 00:09:37,366
- Gil, let's go.

111
00:09:37,391 --> 00:09:38,599
Oh! Right, gotta go.

112
00:09:42,913 --> 00:09:44,647
- Okay, you have the keys?
- Yeah.

113
00:09:44,671 --> 00:09:45,385
- Two sets.
- Yeah.

114
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:47,337
- No how to work the washer and dryer.. the alarm..
- Yeah

115
00:09:47,361 --> 00:09:49,326
Okay. You have to have the hotel number.

116
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,926
You have your father's beeper number.

117
00:09:50,951 --> 00:09:51,343
Yeah.

118
00:09:51,414 --> 00:09:52,413
Anything else..

119
00:09:53,001 --> 00:09:54,000
Dial 911.

120
00:09:54,954 --> 00:09:56,433
What about 976?

121
00:09:57,433 --> 00:09:59,366
Excuse me? Gil?

122
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:03,586
Your mother and I are putting a lot of trust in you here, son.

123
00:10:04,146 --> 00:10:06,977
We don't want any primate business while we're gone. Alright?

124
00:10:07,121 --> 00:10:08,120
Okay, dad.

125
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:11,740
You can stay here, or, you can stay at Dicks.

126
00:10:11,764 --> 00:10:12,506
Micks.

127
00:10:12,531 --> 00:10:13,253
Right.

128
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:17,000
Oh, and remember, whatever you do, don't do it alone.

129
00:10:17,001 --> 00:10:17,726
Okay.

130
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:21,400
Oh, and Timothy, Timothy, don't watch cartoons all day, okay?

131
00:10:21,681 --> 00:10:23,680
What's wrong with watching cartoons?

132
00:10:24,001 --> 00:10:26,000
Wait, your mother's right, Tim.

133
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:28,493
A boy your age should be out.

134
00:10:29,227 --> 00:10:30,627
Oh, splitting atoms.

135
00:10:31,016 --> 00:10:32,566
Or, whatever it is boys do.

136
00:10:34,011 --> 00:10:35,786
What's wrong with doing what I want?

137
00:10:36,001 --> 00:10:37,121
Oh, well.

138
00:10:37,146 --> 00:10:40,000
Because the world doesn't revolve around Timothy Shepard.

139
00:10:40,383 --> 00:10:43,386
Now, I don't have to tell you to stay out of lab, do I?

140
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,553
Oh, the la.. oh, no, don't worry, I'll take care of it.

141
00:10:49,547 --> 00:10:50,146
Kiss?

142
00:10:52,341 --> 00:10:53,266
Thank you.

143
00:10:59,113 --> 00:11:00,521
Hey, guys.

144
00:11:00,546 --> 00:11:02,186
I got this volcanic idea.

145
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,000
- Hey, hurry.
- Careful.

146
00:11:06,026 --> 00:11:07,106
- Careful.
- Right.

147
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,694
Be careful with that.

148
00:11:11,966 --> 00:11:15,160
We're going to watch dinosaurs on the big t.v. in the lab.

149
00:11:17,167 --> 00:11:18,794
Timmy, didn't you just get busted?

150
00:11:19,132 --> 00:11:21,732
I mean, we could get caught.

151
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,580
Come on.

152
00:11:32,026 --> 00:11:33,720
All right, come on.

153
00:11:37,146 --> 00:11:40,240
All right, I'll tell you the code, and you punch it in.

154
00:11:40,807 --> 00:11:41,806
Oh, no.

155
00:11:42,174 --> 00:11:43,173
Not definitely not.

156
00:11:43,573 --> 00:11:45,040
You know I'm not good at these things?

157
00:11:45,726 --> 00:11:48,171
Ever since a broke my sister's calculator when I was ten, I just..

158
00:11:48,196 --> 00:11:49,646
Gotcha.

159
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,073
You didn't think I was gonna tell you the code, any way, did you?

160
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:54,753
Oh.

161
00:11:55,219 --> 00:11:56,619
I knew that.

162
00:11:57,128 --> 00:11:58,127
I did.

163
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,811
I don't know about this, Timmy.

164
00:12:29,972 --> 00:12:32,426
It smells like orange juice in here.

165
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:36,653
Hey, Mick, move that pedestal aside.

166
00:12:48,906 --> 00:12:52,000
Whoa.. Check it out.

167
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,000
The ultrasaurus of televisions.

168
00:12:55,196 --> 00:12:56,746
Yeah, cool, huh?

169
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,544
I know your parents are supposed to be, like, these brilliant

170
00:12:59,568 --> 00:13:00,692
scientists or something,

171
00:13:00,716 --> 00:13:03,452
but I always wondered how they make a living in here.

172
00:13:03,477 --> 00:13:06,113
Oh, we're still living off royalties from those solid

173
00:13:06,113 --> 00:13:08,313
drape runners they patented a long time ago.

174
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:12,000
Timmy, are you sure you know what you're doing?

175
00:13:12,121 --> 00:13:13,120
Yeah, don't worry.

176
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,433
I think you guys are ready to clam up and watch.

177
00:13:28,513 --> 00:13:31,512
Wow, grippin'.

178
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,693
Can't wait for the sequel.

179
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:42,546
You just gotta turn it on.

180
00:13:44,233 --> 00:13:44,793
Timmy..

181
00:13:45,142 --> 00:13:47,025
positive you know what you're doing?

182
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:49,639
Do you want to see dinosaurs or not?

183
00:13:54,293 --> 00:13:55,592
Yeah.

184
00:13:56,212 --> 00:13:57,438
This is great.

185
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:13,813
Uh, Timmy?

186
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,973
What button did you push, Timmy? Shut it off!

187
00:15:06,926 --> 00:15:08,606
Oh! What's happening?!

188
00:16:09,896 --> 00:16:11,466
I feel nauseous.

189
00:16:13,016 --> 00:16:15,040
Your parents are really gonna kill you now, Timmy.

190
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,873
That was no earthquake.

191
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:40,386
Hey, what the hot lava is going on here?

192
00:16:40,973 --> 00:16:43,519
It's a.. it's a..

193
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:44,800
No way.

194
00:16:45,167 --> 00:16:46,273
Yes way.

195
00:16:46,774 --> 00:16:48,820
It's Forry, and we're in dinosaurs.

196
00:16:48,947 --> 00:16:51,319
Except it's like 3D now.

197
00:16:52,561 --> 00:16:55,706
I thought you needed special glasses or something for 3D.

198
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,640
Look, you can't pull anything over on me.

199
00:16:58,664 --> 00:17:01,706
Uh-uh, I know you apes gotta be rocky spies

200
00:17:01,706 --> 00:17:04,333
and it won't do you any good to try and get it out of me.

201
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:06,357
Hey, what kind of rocky are you anyway?

202
00:17:06,382 --> 00:17:08,073
Pay attention when I'm talking to you.

203
00:17:08,098 --> 00:17:12,166
Hey guys, guess who's coming to dinner.

204
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,840
Hey, let me take a look.

205
00:17:16,734 --> 00:17:18,733
The Rockies!

206
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:21,491
Hide.

207
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,826
N- n- no, this way.

208
00:17:32,066 --> 00:17:35,100
Let me get by here, if that saur's in here, will find her.

209
00:17:35,126 --> 00:17:36,733
He ain't got a prayer.

210
00:17:38,868 --> 00:17:39,867
You there.

211
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:49,000
Yeah, I'll find that saur.

212
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:51,000
That saur is mine.

213
00:18:04,001 --> 00:18:05,866
This is messing up my hair.

214
00:18:06,713 --> 00:18:07,386
Bear..

215
00:18:07,567 --> 00:18:08,400
Bonehead..

216
00:18:08,594 --> 00:18:09,593
Through there.

217
00:18:09,906 --> 00:18:14,246
Ooh, You be a good Bear, Baby.

218
00:18:16,225 --> 00:18:17,718
Knock 'em dead.

219
00:18:21,248 --> 00:18:22,773
Aw, come on.

220
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:24,026
What do you want now, Link?

221
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:26,000
You already stripped Saur City bare.

222
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:28,386
And all that's left is women, children, and

223
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,873
us little guys who are no use to you.

224
00:18:30,898 --> 00:18:32,700
My my.

225
00:18:33,001 --> 00:18:34,273
Such hostility.

226
00:18:37,001 --> 00:18:39,000
And ill timed too.

227
00:18:39,025 --> 00:18:42,126
Considering I just saw that escaped saur run out of here.

228
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,620
Wait, Link, don't hurt him.

229
00:18:45,841 --> 00:18:47,840
I mean he is kind of cute.

230
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,000
Kinda reminds me of my Bear.

231
00:18:54,653 --> 00:18:56,367
Where is that saur?

232
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:00,408
Get lost, you Cro-Magnon moron.

233
00:19:00,586 --> 00:19:02,153
What.. What's he mean by that?

234
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:05,313
Uh, well, uh, he means Link that,uh,

235
00:19:05,313 --> 00:19:08,866
you're very highly positioned on the evolutionary

236
00:19:08,866 --> 00:19:13,160
chain of the Homo Sapien kingdom, for a Neanderthal.

237
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:16,151
Compliments will get you no place.

238
00:19:16,293 --> 00:19:19,000
Well, that depends on the approach.

239
00:19:19,153 --> 00:19:20,000
Doesn't it?

240
00:19:20,001 --> 00:19:23,128
You adorable little creature, you.

241
00:19:23,153 --> 00:19:25,646
You now tell the Missy where she went.

242
00:19:25,671 --> 00:19:27,233
No chance, Babe.

243
00:19:28,142 --> 00:19:29,306
Listen here.

244
00:19:29,486 --> 00:19:32,239
Sooner or later, we find all of you who try to escape.

245
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Just, uh, tell us where she went.

246
00:19:35,001 --> 00:19:37,969
- Get down
- and it'll go, uh, easier on everybody.

247
00:19:37,993 --> 00:19:40,000
Go, jump in a crater.

248
00:19:43,028 --> 00:19:44,516
I got her.

249
00:19:48,626 --> 00:19:51,977
Link, I told you we'd find her in the power station.

250
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,977
Take me back. But let my son go home.

251
00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:57,013
He's no use to you!

252
00:19:57,037 --> 00:19:58,633
That's my Bear.

253
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:01,069
Come on.

254
00:20:02,029 --> 00:20:05,028
Wait a minute, you're taking a hatchling?

255
00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:08,206
That's not all.

256
00:20:08,553 --> 00:20:12,557
Wait, if you take that, the cooling units on the lava tanks won't work.

257
00:20:12,581 --> 00:20:15,269
And we'll be looking at it complete meltdown of Saur

258
00:20:15,269 --> 00:20:17,069
City in less than 24 hours.

259
00:20:17,355 --> 00:20:19,336
Ain't you an Einstein.

260
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,881
That's the idea, birdbrain.

261
00:20:23,204 --> 00:20:25,203
Mr. Big's been shutting this city down for a while.

262
00:20:25,228 --> 00:20:27,759
'bout time somebody finished it, once and for all.

263
00:20:28,699 --> 00:20:29,499
Oh.

264
00:20:36,127 --> 00:20:38,673
Somebody's got to stay here till meltdown starts

265
00:20:38,673 --> 00:20:41,960
to make sure they don't try any, uh, lizard business.

266
00:20:51,547 --> 00:20:52,946
You got it, darling.

267
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:57,379
Come on, let's go.

268
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,200
See you later, darling.

269
00:21:00,494 --> 00:21:02,000
I'll be back.

270
00:21:05,194 --> 00:21:07,193
Woo, woo, wow.

271
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:18,600
Back to the tower, boys, Mr. Big's waiting.

272
00:21:41,406 --> 00:21:42,407
Quiet.

273
00:21:57,713 --> 00:21:59,493
Talk about natural gas.

274
00:22:02,893 --> 00:22:03,533
This way

275
00:22:04,219 --> 00:22:05,819
No, Timmy, this way.

276
00:22:13,653 --> 00:22:14,959
Are they gone yet?

277
00:22:15,594 --> 00:22:16,633
Yeah.

278
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,520
Hey, wait a minute.

279
00:22:21,167 --> 00:22:23,240
Aren't these the door we came through?

280
00:22:25,596 --> 00:22:28,480
But there was stuff spinning. And lights.

281
00:22:29,201 --> 00:22:31,200
Mm, there's nothing here.

282
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:34,600
Except for darkness.

283
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,680
Wait the fuse.

284
00:22:36,705 --> 00:22:38,960
When the Rockies took the fuse, something happened.

285
00:22:42,734 --> 00:22:46,280
I'll take fatal mistakes for a thousand, Jamie.

286
00:22:46,734 --> 00:22:48,960
Who is someone we'll never listen to again?

287
00:22:50,023 --> 00:22:51,440
Ding ding ding.

288
00:22:51,727 --> 00:22:52,726
Who is?

289
00:22:53,082 --> 00:22:54,120
Timmy.

290
00:22:55,146 --> 00:22:56,200
Who me?

291
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,760
Come on, let's go find Forry.

292
00:23:09,994 --> 00:23:12,440
Now, Mr Big gives me a reward.

293
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:18,813
Dude, this is all your fault?

294
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,506
are you crazy?

295
00:23:22,061 --> 00:23:24,200
After all I've done for you?

296
00:23:25,063 --> 00:23:26,593
You should be thanking me.

297
00:23:27,265 --> 00:23:28,702
Get a life, Mick.

298
00:23:29,085 --> 00:23:31,800
We're in dinosaurs for a roarin' out loud.

299
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:34,779
Come on, you always hated the Rockies.

300
00:23:34,804 --> 00:23:36,360
But this is your big chance.

301
00:23:37,656 --> 00:23:38,806
To do what?

302
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:42,150
Get my intestines wrapped around a tree by some Neanderthal?

303
00:23:42,702 --> 00:23:43,952
No, I think not.

304
00:23:45,078 --> 00:23:46,298
Timmy's gone bye-bye.

305
00:23:48,055 --> 00:23:49,102
Think about it.

306
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,866
It's a cartoon, right?

307
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,801
We know everything about this place.

308
00:23:54,686 --> 00:23:56,231
We're in control.

309
00:23:56,255 --> 00:23:58,989
Let's have some fun before we go back to Dullsville.

310
00:23:59,826 --> 00:24:01,300
Jamie, you want to meet Rex..

311
00:24:03,213 --> 00:24:05,259
We know he's going to stomp the Rockies.

312
00:24:06,251 --> 00:24:07,970
We know he's in Tar Town.

313
00:24:08,194 --> 00:24:09,193
Let's go get him.

314
00:24:11,433 --> 00:24:15,000
Total meltdown, the end, finite, it's over.

315
00:24:19,266 --> 00:24:20,600
Why me?

316
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:21,366
Hey, there's Forry.

317
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:23,480
Hey Forry.

318
00:24:23,504 --> 00:24:25,806
You think you can't fly. 'Cause you got hurt.

319
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:27,569
But we know it's all in your head.

320
00:24:27,748 --> 00:24:29,789
We'll help you learn again, if you come with us.

321
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:33,880
First you hominids waltz in here without an explanation.

322
00:24:34,093 --> 00:24:35,333
You insult me.

323
00:24:35,357 --> 00:24:37,673
And by the way, Who are you?

324
00:24:38,339 --> 00:24:39,426
Oh, I'm sorry.

325
00:24:39,925 --> 00:24:42,950
I'm Timmy Shepard and this is Jamie and that's Mick.

326
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,259
Hey, Forry.

327
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,473
Mr.. Forry.

328
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:48,509
Do you think maybe I could have your autograph before we leave?

329
00:24:48,533 --> 00:24:50,502
You're kind of my hero.

330
00:24:51,226 --> 00:24:52,225
Right.

331
00:24:52,368 --> 00:24:56,085
I'm probably going to die under molten lava in 24 hours.

332
00:24:56,109 --> 00:24:59,292
And I have to spend my day with a bunch of crazy apes.

333
00:24:59,408 --> 00:25:00,707
Why me?

334
00:25:00,731 --> 00:25:03,440
If you'll excuse me now, I've got to get out of here.

335
00:25:03,465 --> 00:25:05,092
And I suggest you do the same.

336
00:25:05,117 --> 00:25:07,640
Because the lava is starting to go.

337
00:25:09,232 --> 00:25:10,729
What's happening in there?

338
00:25:11,365 --> 00:25:12,364
Red.

339
00:25:12,789 --> 00:25:13,788
Bubbling.

340
00:25:13,813 --> 00:25:15,113
Hot.

341
00:25:15,926 --> 00:25:16,653
Lava.

342
00:25:17,819 --> 00:25:19,013
Boiling, Lava.

343
00:25:20,202 --> 00:25:21,201
Scary.

344
00:25:22,147 --> 00:25:23,027
I'm scared.

345
00:25:23,051 --> 00:25:24,255
I want to go home.

346
00:25:24,947 --> 00:25:26,480
Four, you've got to help us.

347
00:25:26,505 --> 00:25:28,369
Kids, I got my own problems.

348
00:25:30,739 --> 00:25:34,751
In the cartoon, you're the one who goes to Tar Town to get Rex.

349
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,606
To stop the Rockies and save Saur City

350
00:25:37,631 --> 00:25:38,993
Yeah, right.

351
00:25:39,619 --> 00:25:41,160
Now you're going to take us too.

352
00:25:41,781 --> 00:25:44,442
Sure, Tar Town. Tail pit of the world.

353
00:25:44,467 --> 00:25:48,035
There's no way they there since the Rockies took over the train.

354
00:25:49,016 --> 00:25:50,015
Great.

355
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:53,000
24 hours, we'll be jacuzzi'ing in hot lava.

356
00:25:53,269 --> 00:25:54,719
Wait a minute, look at this.

357
00:25:54,956 --> 00:25:56,332
Why can't we go this way?

358
00:25:56,601 --> 00:25:57,893
No way, Doll.

359
00:25:57,918 --> 00:25:58,917
Why not?

360
00:25:58,942 --> 00:25:59,941
Forget it.

361
00:26:00,001 --> 00:26:01,977
Extinction Grove.

362
00:26:02,732 --> 00:26:03,527
What's that?

363
00:26:05,285 --> 00:26:06,386
It's like a graveyard.

364
00:26:06,866 --> 00:26:07,293
Whoa.

365
00:26:07,804 --> 00:26:08,493
Time out.

366
00:26:08,848 --> 00:26:09,466
Graveyard?

367
00:26:09,827 --> 00:26:10,600
Wait, lemme think?

368
00:26:11,294 --> 00:26:12,005
No.

369
00:26:12,219 --> 00:26:14,473
No, I don't remember there ever being a graveyard in the cartoon.

370
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:16,200
Must be an episode we haven't seen yet.

371
00:26:16,878 --> 00:26:18,133
So, why can't we go that way.

372
00:26:18,158 --> 00:26:20,620
I mean, it's just a stupid old graveyard.

373
00:26:20,645 --> 00:26:23,240
Nobody's been that way in a millennium.

374
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:26,200
Once they go in, no reptile is ever left.

375
00:26:26,356 --> 00:26:27,306
Alive.

376
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,000
Dead dinosaurs tell no tales.

377
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:33,630
Well, we have to get the fuse to get home, right?

378
00:26:34,023 --> 00:26:36,873
And we have to get Rex to help us get the fuse.

379
00:26:37,246 --> 00:26:38,826
It's decided then.

380
00:26:38,851 --> 00:26:40,546
We're going through the graveyard.

381
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:45,296
And you're coming with us, whether you like it or not.

382
00:26:45,321 --> 00:26:47,660
Hey, what are you doing? Watch the wings.

383
00:26:48,001 --> 00:26:51,000
Hey you, you five fingered ape. Hey, put me down.

384
00:26:51,001 --> 00:26:53,800
I'm not going to Tar Town. I'm telling you it's a really bad neighborhood.

385
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:55,000
Trust me, guys.

386
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,000
Let's have fun, Mick.

387
00:26:58,001 --> 00:26:59,773
Great. More fun.

388
00:26:59,798 --> 00:27:01,577
Aw, don't be so petrified.

389
00:27:02,161 --> 00:27:03,553
Oh, why me?

390
00:27:06,832 --> 00:27:07,978
WOW!

391
00:27:12,332 --> 00:27:13,493
Mr. Big's tower.

392
00:27:13,973 --> 00:27:15,560
I can't believe it's real.

393
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:23,896
Hey, can't we talk this over, guys?I mean, graveyards, Tar Town, Rex.

394
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,950
And what makes you think you'll help us anyway?

395
00:27:25,975 --> 00:27:27,974
Hey, hey, hey, are you guys listen to me?

396
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:41,660
I can't wait to see what it gives you, Bear.

397
00:27:41,685 --> 00:27:42,684
Yeah.

398
00:27:43,521 --> 00:27:44,153
Hi.

399
00:27:44,178 --> 00:27:45,177
Yeah.

400
00:27:48,954 --> 00:27:50,160
Well..

401
00:27:50,173 --> 00:27:50,673
Yeah..

402
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,873
Well..

403
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:53,893
We got you a steg-saur.

404
00:27:54,133 --> 00:27:55,646
And a bonus too.

405
00:27:56,001 --> 00:27:58,000
Who led the search party?

406
00:27:58,109 --> 00:27:59,453
I did.

407
00:27:59,734 --> 00:28:02,733
My Bear found the saur.

408
00:28:02,758 --> 00:28:06,066
Come forward and receive your reward.

409
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,480
Thank you, thank you.

410
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:13,686
I hope you enjoy it.

411
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:15,266
That's right.

412
00:28:16,001 --> 00:28:18,000
Want a light?

413
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:23,206
Give it to him, Small.

414
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:35,320
Whoever was most anxious to capture the saur

415
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:38,550
was probably the man who let her escape in the first place.

416
00:28:38,575 --> 00:28:41,426
I won't tolerate this kind of inefficiency.

417
00:28:41,451 --> 00:28:42,760
No way! Huh-uh!

418
00:28:42,784 --> 00:28:45,660
Let this be an example for discipline.

419
00:28:45,685 --> 00:28:48,684
I'll have no more foolish games from you idiots.

420
00:28:49,001 --> 00:28:51,233
Do I make myself clear?

421
00:28:52,001 --> 00:28:53,000
Yes, Sir.

422
00:28:53,001 --> 00:28:54,000
Yes, Sir.

423
00:28:54,525 --> 00:28:57,293
Good!Take her away.

424
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,288
You're mine now.

425
00:29:04,313 --> 00:29:06,000
Take it outside, mammals.

426
00:29:08,153 --> 00:29:10,354
You are a Cro-Magnon moron!

427
00:29:10,379 --> 00:29:12,073
You don't have to butter me up.

428
00:29:12,097 --> 00:29:13,320
Put me down, Link.

429
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:16,846
- Link, put me down.
- Meltdown soon...

430
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:32,766
Hominids and their great ideas.

431
00:29:32,791 --> 00:29:34,790
So much for evolution.

432
00:29:43,566 --> 00:29:45,706
Extinction..

433
00:29:45,731 --> 00:29:46,730
Grove.

434
00:29:47,847 --> 00:29:49,360
You go through there?

435
00:29:50,034 --> 00:29:51,473
Here, take Forry.

436
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,376
Stop, locked, and, blocked.

437
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,026
Sorry, guys, we're moving on.

438
00:29:56,051 --> 00:29:59,873
If we head for the high ground now, we might make it before the lava comes.

439
00:29:59,967 --> 00:30:01,867
Not so fast, Forry.

440
00:30:03,693 --> 00:30:04,773
What are you doing, Tim?

441
00:30:14,966 --> 00:30:17,213
You were saying, Forry.

442
00:30:23,906 --> 00:30:26,180
Ah! This place is cool.

443
00:30:26,636 --> 00:30:27,880
Yeah, cool.

444
00:30:27,905 --> 00:30:29,904
As in, goodbye cool world.

445
00:30:49,207 --> 00:30:52,000
I wish Tops and Rex were here right now.

446
00:30:52,001 --> 00:30:54,560
What makes you so sure they're going to help us anyway?

447
00:30:54,585 --> 00:30:58,197
Rex and the folks in Saur City don't exactly see eye to eye.

448
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:05,819
I knew I shouldn't have got out of bed this morning.

449
00:31:30,207 --> 00:31:31,553
Oh. Mick.

450
00:31:40,253 --> 00:31:41,053
Hey guys..

451
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:43,259
maybe..

452
00:31:44,413 --> 00:31:46,213
maybe Forry's right?

453
00:31:53,721 --> 00:31:55,720
I warned you guys.

454
00:32:08,646 --> 00:32:12,000
I wonder why this was never in the cartoon.

455
00:32:12,233 --> 00:32:13,733
It's too scary for kids.

456
00:32:29,181 --> 00:32:31,180
Boy, this is great.

457
00:32:31,587 --> 00:32:35,000
This is better than a dinosaur story Jamie ever wrote.

458
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:36,059
Lost..

459
00:32:36,473 --> 00:32:37,433
we're lost..

460
00:32:38,139 --> 00:32:39,480
we're definitely lost.

461
00:32:57,268 --> 00:32:58,860
But how do we get across?

462
00:33:01,001 --> 00:33:02,000
Easy.

463
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,160
How about if I just wait here?

464
00:33:11,733 --> 00:33:14,280
No way, Forry, we need you.

465
00:33:16,143 --> 00:33:18,480
Oh, it's great to be needed.

466
00:33:47,394 --> 00:33:48,333
Water..

467
00:33:49,687 --> 00:33:51,320
I've always hated water.

468
00:33:52,491 --> 00:33:54,240
When I was six, I went swimming..

469
00:33:55,225 --> 00:33:56,680
my brother's held my head under water..

470
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,579
My brother's friends held my head under water.

471
00:33:59,914 --> 00:34:00,913
Oh! I love water!

472
00:34:01,006 --> 00:34:02,906
Oh yeah! just love it!

473
00:34:02,931 --> 00:34:04,520
Bring on some more for me, huh?

474
00:34:04,621 --> 00:34:06,101
Like I'm not neurotic enough already.

475
00:34:06,125 --> 00:34:07,580
I need somebody to put water in front of me.

476
00:34:07,605 --> 00:34:09,604
- Oh, this is just-- GAH!!
- MICK!

477
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,900
Timmy! Do something!!

478
00:34:12,135 --> 00:34:13,926
- Where'd he go?
- Wait, I can't see him.

479
00:34:13,967 --> 00:34:14,553
Mick!

480
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:15,760
I knew it!!

481
00:34:17,387 --> 00:34:19,239
- There he is!
- Someone do something!

482
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:19,739
Mick!

483
00:34:19,953 --> 00:34:21,040
Timmy, grab him!!

484
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,000
Mick?!

485
00:34:24,381 --> 00:34:28,020
There he is! Come on, Mick! Great! Grab on, Mick!

486
00:34:28,152 --> 00:34:29,030
Timmy!

487
00:34:29,177 --> 00:34:29,940
Grab him!

488
00:34:29,947 --> 00:34:30,846
Something's got my leg!

489
00:34:30,987 --> 00:34:31,986
Hit it, Timmy!

490
00:34:32,306 --> 00:34:34,713
I knew we'd never make it out alive.

491
00:34:34,867 --> 00:34:35,931
Kill it!

492
00:34:36,187 --> 00:34:37,546
HIT IT!!

493
00:34:37,558 --> 00:34:38,968
WE'RE DINNER!!

494
00:34:46,247 --> 00:34:47,152
Where is it?

495
00:34:47,387 --> 00:34:49,180
Let's not wait to find out!

496
00:34:50,887 --> 00:34:51,586
This way.

497
00:34:51,768 --> 00:34:52,767
No, let's go back.

498
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:54,847
Come on, go!

499
00:34:56,866 --> 00:34:57,766
Timmy!

500
00:35:01,893 --> 00:35:03,740
What are you staring at?

501
00:35:07,474 --> 00:35:13,000
- AAHHHHHH!!
- AAHHHHHH!!

502
00:35:18,001 --> 00:35:21,226
Come on. Come on. Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

503
00:35:23,326 --> 00:35:26,000
Do you guys realize that was a Messosaurus?

504
00:35:26,254 --> 00:35:27,492
Boy genius.

505
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:33,000
Forry, are you OK?

506
00:35:33,027 --> 00:35:34,026
Oh.

507
00:35:34,051 --> 00:35:35,346
Sorry, Forry.

508
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:39,167
Dames are all alike.

509
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,720
They all drop you, eventually.

510
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,680
You guys, we made it.

511
00:36:10,183 --> 00:36:11,033
Great.

512
00:36:17,572 --> 00:36:19,986
I really hate this place.

513
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:21,680
It's not what I expected.

514
00:36:21,705 --> 00:36:24,376
What's a matter, Timmy? I thought this was your favorite part.

515
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,600
I doesn't smell in cartoon.

516
00:36:26,894 --> 00:36:29,500
Besides, have you looked at your hair, lately?

517
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:32,000
Man, anybody got a comb?

518
00:36:32,025 --> 00:36:34,024
Where's my cave?

519
00:36:36,607 --> 00:36:37,760
Apes!

520
00:36:44,254 --> 00:36:45,253
Sorry.

521
00:36:45,413 --> 00:36:46,313
It's OK.

522
00:36:47,133 --> 00:36:50,000
You know, your hair looks kind of cool that way.

523
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,767
See Forry, this place is OK.

524
00:36:52,791 --> 00:36:56,320
That'll teach you to cheat, you scumscale!

525
00:36:59,574 --> 00:37:01,573
You guys are crazy.

526
00:37:04,001 --> 00:37:07,101
Hey! Some loser just knocked over our tip jar.

527
00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:10,400
Hey, hey, you didn't pay for your drink, Jerko.

528
00:37:10,425 --> 00:37:11,275
Get a life.

529
00:37:12,006 --> 00:37:13,606
Read 'em and weep.

530
00:37:13,714 --> 00:37:15,340
Not so fast.

531
00:37:16,297 --> 00:37:18,320
- Full Cave.
- Way to go pal.

532
00:37:18,347 --> 00:37:21,046
- Plate 'em and slate 'em.
- Ooh, yeah.

533
00:37:28,107 --> 00:37:29,459
- Look at that!
- What are those?

534
00:37:30,621 --> 00:37:31,620
What bunch of freaks?

535
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:37,960
Looking for action, big boy.

536
00:38:00,721 --> 00:38:03,020
Hey, when does the show start?

537
00:38:03,601 --> 00:38:05,600
You gonna bet any time this year, huh?

538
00:38:05,707 --> 00:38:09,706
Lizards and Saurians, The Sharp Fang is proud to present.

539
00:38:09,706 --> 00:38:12,700
Raquel and her Million B.C.'s

540
00:38:25,314 --> 00:38:27,672
WOW! what a babe!

541
00:38:43,977 --> 00:38:44,976
Hey, Hairless.

542
00:38:49,001 --> 00:38:51,866
- How'd you like to do the vertical stomp.
- Well, I..

543
00:38:57,067 --> 00:38:59,653
I just love soft, pink skin.

544
00:38:59,841 --> 00:39:01,440
Mick, help!!

545
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:04,200
Come here, Sugar. Come here, come on, come here.

546
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,760
Gimme a primordial ooze, heh.

547
00:39:11,293 --> 00:39:13,080
Hey, I want one of those..

548
00:39:13,105 --> 00:39:15,104
Are you sure you can handle it?

549
00:39:15,129 --> 00:39:16,128
Yeah.

550
00:39:37,093 --> 00:39:38,884
I tried to warn ya.

551
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,747
- Oh God, I'm so thirsty.
- Wait, you guys?

552
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:02,000
One too many, huh, babe?

553
00:40:06,098 --> 00:40:07,973
Hey you guys, that was Tops.

554
00:40:07,998 --> 00:40:08,873
Who?

555
00:40:08,898 --> 00:40:09,666
Tops.

556
00:40:09,691 --> 00:40:11,593
He's like Rex's Barney Rubble.

557
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:12,617
Who's that?

558
00:40:13,034 --> 00:40:15,640
Anyway, he looks like a hustler from here.

559
00:40:15,665 --> 00:40:18,320
- If that's Tops
- Then that must be Rex.

560
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:19,920
Come on.

561
00:40:22,941 --> 00:40:24,673
Hey, where are you going?

562
00:40:25,913 --> 00:40:27,813
Hey, queen of claws is high.

563
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,200
Hey Tops.

564
00:40:30,224 --> 00:40:32,152
Tops pal, we need your help.

565
00:40:32,176 --> 00:40:33,800
We need to talk to Rex right away.

566
00:40:33,987 --> 00:40:35,787
Do I know you?

567
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:40,000
I hope not because you guys are so pink and hurts to look at you.

568
00:40:40,001 --> 00:40:42,000
Hey, it's kinda dark down here.

569
00:40:44,478 --> 00:40:47,253
Look, we're here on important business.

570
00:40:47,641 --> 00:40:49,640
Now you, I know.

571
00:40:49,665 --> 00:40:51,489
The little birds that can't fly.

572
00:40:51,513 --> 00:40:53,000
Hey, who are you calling a bird?

573
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:55,122
Talk money and I won't call you a bird.

574
00:40:55,146 --> 00:40:57,386
Look, this concerns the fate of Saur City.

575
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:59,653
The Rockies you've been picking almost everything we have

576
00:40:59,653 --> 00:41:01,699
and now they're going to melt the city down.

577
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:04,360
Right, I'll bring the marshmallows.

578
00:41:04,581 --> 00:41:06,187
So you're not even going to help?

579
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,400
Wait a minute.

580
00:41:08,747 --> 00:41:10,460
You guys always help.

581
00:41:10,978 --> 00:41:13,855
Like, remember the time in episode 12

582
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:17,800
when the Rockies took over, Primeval Park, and they rousted "Old Steg".

583
00:41:17,825 --> 00:41:20,660
- And you guys had to swing from those vines to save him.
- Wait a minute, Rex?

584
00:41:20,684 --> 00:41:22,427
These guys are wacko.

585
00:41:22,767 --> 00:41:25,480
Look, Rexy and I are doing fine.

586
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:27,433
It's not our problem, babe.

587
00:41:27,529 --> 00:41:30,079
You know, I'm really disappointed in you.

588
00:41:30,227 --> 00:41:32,547
The Rex I used know, I would have leapt at the chance to get out of this

589
00:41:32,547 --> 00:41:34,067
dump and be a hero.

590
00:41:35,001 --> 00:41:37,100
But, the truth is, you only think of yourself.

591
00:41:38,176 --> 00:41:39,826
Like someone else I know.

592
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:46,000
Considering how those leaf eaters in Saur City feel about my father,

593
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:49,000
they're not going to back me to fight against the Rockies.

594
00:41:49,526 --> 00:41:51,727
And I can't take all the Rockies myself.

595
00:41:51,752 --> 00:41:53,720
So, you're a coward, too?

596
00:41:58,913 --> 00:42:00,727
Rockies!

597
00:42:04,001 --> 00:42:06,760
Big trouble, big trouble.

598
00:42:14,634 --> 00:42:16,633
It's looks like a disgrace to evolution.

599
00:42:16,887 --> 00:42:20,140
You know, I heard this is the place where all the toughest

600
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:21,820
saurs in Tar Town chill.

601
00:42:26,753 --> 00:42:29,000
But I guess what I heard must be wrong.

602
00:42:29,001 --> 00:42:30,873
Because I don't see nobody comes here

603
00:42:30,898 --> 00:42:32,897
just a bunch of yellow reptiles.

604
00:42:41,701 --> 00:42:44,700
Take this ugly scale head for example.

605
00:42:44,748 --> 00:42:46,747
Would you..

606
00:42:47,113 --> 00:42:49,913
Now I heard all the Tyrannosaurs were dead.

607
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:54,832
But I guess the real truth is, they all turned into fossil disease. Like this.

608
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:01,760
I know you Rockies don't have tail brains like saurs

609
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,832
but I always thought you had at least one brain.

610
00:43:05,513 --> 00:43:10,000
I wouldn't be talking about brains if I was you.. Saur.

611
00:43:17,674 --> 00:43:19,673
Yeah. Yeah.

612
00:43:21,853 --> 00:43:25,760
'cause that was one stupid thing to say.

613
00:43:26,225 --> 00:43:28,626
You know something, I wondering how many people would

614
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:33,373
still bet on a half extinct sour who's nothing but the cowardly

615
00:43:33,373 --> 00:43:34,560
offspring of a traitor.

616
00:43:40,753 --> 00:43:43,775
He hit 'im, he hit 'im. See that? Did you see that

617
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,800
He hit 'im, square in the jaw

618
00:43:52,867 --> 00:43:54,600
THUNDERIN'!!

619
00:43:56,947 --> 00:43:58,880
Mick! MICK!

620
00:43:58,887 --> 00:44:02,120
- You want me to do violence?
- Just get rid of him!!

621
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,640
Wow, I got a loaded gun.

622
00:44:41,166 --> 00:44:41,939
Hey!

623
00:44:44,706 --> 00:44:46,680
I dare you to do that, again!

624
00:45:00,647 --> 00:45:01,653
My glasses!

625
00:45:08,733 --> 00:45:11,360
Hey! Who's gonna pay for this mess!!

626
00:45:29,326 --> 00:45:30,900
Eat my scales.

627
00:45:40,859 --> 00:45:42,259
- Mick..
- Oops.

628
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:45,426
Thanks.

629
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:46,626
Oh, man.

630
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:00,440
Gimme claw!

631
00:46:06,133 --> 00:46:09,913
I don't believe it, I never saw such a bunch of sissies!!

632
00:46:14,046 --> 00:46:16,000
You know, she's right, Tops.

633
00:46:16,001 --> 00:46:17,180
This place is a dump.

634
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:19,241
Wait a minute, Rex, you can't be thinking of going.

635
00:46:19,266 --> 00:46:20,509
I got a better idea.

636
00:46:20,534 --> 00:46:22,700
We could make a lot of money here in Tar Town.

637
00:46:22,856 --> 00:46:25,726
Has it ever occurred to you, there's more to life than just money?

638
00:46:25,751 --> 00:46:26,601
Well, no.

639
00:46:27,075 --> 00:46:28,586
But, what about the Rockie Patrols?

640
00:46:28,611 --> 00:46:30,610
I know a secret way to Saur City.

641
00:46:30,635 --> 00:46:31,634
Come on guys.

642
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:45,873
Hey, Link.

643
00:46:46,434 --> 00:46:48,066
I think you should see this man.

644
00:46:48,091 --> 00:46:52,073
He just came from Tar Town, and he's got a story you'll want to hear.

645
00:46:52,098 --> 00:46:54,293
Yeah, there's a Tyrannosaurus headed

646
00:46:54,273 --> 00:46:56,873
for Sour City and a Proto-Cerotops and

647
00:46:57,013 --> 00:46:58,913
the little flyer from Sour City.

648
00:46:58,937 --> 00:47:01,480
Now listen, we tried to stop 'em the best we could.

649
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:07,120
Well, well, I came to check the construction

650
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:09,320
and got something even bigger.

651
00:47:09,345 --> 00:47:10,713
Big, big, big.

652
00:47:10,737 --> 00:47:14,360
I think it's time to show the citizens of the Saur City the

653
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:17,347
follies of insurrection, especially when

654
00:47:17,347 --> 00:47:19,340
my plans are so close to fruition.

655
00:47:19,365 --> 00:47:20,080
Right.

656
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:21,920
What does that mean?

657
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:24,327
What it means is I want you to

658
00:47:24,327 --> 00:47:26,848
organize a squad to take that Tyrannosaurus

659
00:47:26,873 --> 00:47:28,793
and anyone who's aiding him.

660
00:47:28,793 --> 00:47:32,187
We'll start with a little flapping eruption first.

661
00:47:32,346 --> 00:47:34,680
And I don't care what condition we take them in.

662
00:47:34,705 --> 00:47:36,704
Do I make myself clear now?

663
00:47:36,729 --> 00:47:38,728
As ice boss.

664
00:47:38,996 --> 00:47:41,019
Good, big plan, big big plan.

665
00:47:42,933 --> 00:47:46,060
Listen, listen, uh, I hate to ask you this really, but

666
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:48,723
didn't I hear someone mention something about a reward.

667
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,309
Come to my office.

668
00:47:53,027 --> 00:47:55,713
Can I offer you a cigar?

669
00:48:15,667 --> 00:48:18,080
Oh! Oh! The lava's coming!!

670
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:29,760
What are you? A bunch of tourists? Run!!

671
00:48:30,386 --> 00:48:31,686
What's going on Forry?

672
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:35,000
They're evacuating the city before the power plant goes.

673
00:48:35,166 --> 00:48:37,526
We should have until dawn though. Come on.

674
00:49:07,933 --> 00:49:09,133
Wow.

675
00:49:09,507 --> 00:49:11,073
Ooh, a treehouse

676
00:49:11,373 --> 00:49:13,720
Yeah, what do you guys think?

677
00:49:14,103 --> 00:49:15,546
It's beautiful.

678
00:49:16,667 --> 00:49:19,040
Hey, Mick, you go first.

679
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,160
Put me down, Timmy.

680
00:49:33,734 --> 00:49:37,080
You guys take the long way up and I'll meet you at the top.

681
00:49:46,507 --> 00:49:47,787
Top floor, guys.

682
00:49:50,587 --> 00:49:52,586
Forry I'm next, right?

683
00:49:53,273 --> 00:49:56,460
Hey, this guy's got bats in his bellfree.

684
00:50:20,589 --> 00:50:22,539
Let's get this party started.

685
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,480
Don't fall, Mick.

686
00:50:40,505 --> 00:50:41,455
It's not funny.

687
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:42,986
Tree's really tall.

688
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:50,400
Yeah, only thing missing is Tarzan.

689
00:51:20,074 --> 00:51:22,313
Aw.. Stop with the small talk, will ya?

690
00:51:22,338 --> 00:51:23,540
I got company here.

691
00:51:23,565 --> 00:51:24,933
Just light the place up.

692
00:51:46,716 --> 00:51:47,800
Rad.

693
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,160
Oh, Wow.

694
00:51:50,481 --> 00:51:52,480
It's even better than it is in the cartoon.

695
00:51:52,721 --> 00:51:56,020
Hey, watch out who you're calling a cartoon, Timmy.

696
00:51:56,434 --> 00:51:58,220
Yeah, what's your angle?

697
00:51:58,663 --> 00:51:59,940
Come on, Tops.

698
00:52:00,037 --> 00:52:02,047
But we don't know anything about them.

699
00:52:02,414 --> 00:52:03,413
Let's fix that.

700
00:52:03,438 --> 00:52:04,540
What about your world?

701
00:52:04,767 --> 00:52:05,660
Well..

702
00:52:05,906 --> 00:52:07,506
There are more buildings.

703
00:52:08,348 --> 00:52:09,347
Schools.

704
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:10,439
Yeah.

705
00:52:10,464 --> 00:52:12,000
Video stores.

706
00:52:12,025 --> 00:52:13,380
And book stores.

707
00:52:14,657 --> 00:52:15,807
Lots of people.

708
00:52:16,208 --> 00:52:17,207
Grandparents?

709
00:52:17,725 --> 00:52:18,724
Parents.

710
00:52:18,749 --> 00:52:20,566
Language teacher, Mr. Ham.

711
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:27,000
Home.. it's not fair.

712
00:52:28,183 --> 00:52:29,433
Mick..

713
00:52:29,768 --> 00:52:30,767
Mick..

714
00:52:31,183 --> 00:52:32,620
What's with them?

715
00:52:36,627 --> 00:52:39,240
We got a few minutes, I'm going to hang.

716
00:52:39,901 --> 00:52:42,420
I think I'm going to go keep an eye out for the Rockies.

717
00:53:12,278 --> 00:53:15,760
Guards at the base of the tower, change just before dawn.

718
00:53:16,308 --> 00:53:17,730
That's when we'll make our move.

719
00:53:17,754 --> 00:53:18,753
Great.

720
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:20,780
What do we do till then?

721
00:53:21,166 --> 00:53:22,480
Do what Forry's doing.

722
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:35,740
What's wrong, Mick?

723
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:38,640
What's wrong?

724
00:53:40,036 --> 00:53:42,400
Jamie, we could be stuck here for the rest of our lives.

725
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:44,087
We won't be.

726
00:53:46,166 --> 00:53:47,172
We'll get back.

727
00:53:54,774 --> 00:53:56,493
I used to be afraid of heights.

728
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:00,760
I'm not anymore.

729
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,467
Hey, what's with the glacier face?

730
00:54:05,341 --> 00:54:07,340
Mom and dad's experiment's sent us here.

731
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,040
Maybe there's other worlds too.

732
00:54:11,354 --> 00:54:14,080
Maybe everything we make up has a life somewhere else.

733
00:54:14,238 --> 00:54:19,113
Like hobbits, sandworms, Captain Nemo.

734
00:54:20,783 --> 00:54:22,880
Why should I have to go back to Dullsville?

735
00:54:25,093 --> 00:54:26,880
You've changed since you've been here.

736
00:54:27,883 --> 00:54:28,680
Yeah?

737
00:54:30,290 --> 00:54:31,640
Well, you look different.

738
00:54:31,946 --> 00:54:35,000
And, um, you don't complain as much as you did before.

739
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:39,353
Oh.

740
00:54:39,378 --> 00:54:41,120
And you were really good in the fight.

741
00:54:43,387 --> 00:54:44,200
What?

742
00:54:47,930 --> 00:54:49,520
Was I as good as Tops?

743
00:54:50,186 --> 00:54:51,407
And Rex?

744
00:54:55,246 --> 00:54:56,200
You were better.

745
00:54:56,674 --> 00:54:57,440
Yeah?

746
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,719
Come on, there's something I should show you.

747
00:55:13,647 --> 00:55:14,600
Come on.

748
00:55:15,133 --> 00:55:17,200
- Where are we going?
- You'll see.

749
00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:29,589
There is no need for me to hide any longer.

750
00:55:29,613 --> 00:55:32,733
Allosaurus' shall rule the world once more.

751
00:55:32,758 --> 00:55:34,757
The reign of terror begins.

752
00:56:21,227 --> 00:56:22,187
What's that?

753
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:25,793
Skull Island.

754
00:56:26,283 --> 00:56:28,280
We're going into the heart of it.

755
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:10,700
Who is that?

756
00:57:11,354 --> 00:57:12,680
My father.

757
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:16,920
This place was once the center of Saur City

758
00:57:16,927 --> 00:57:20,020
where the people built monuments to their greatest leaders.

759
00:57:20,045 --> 00:57:20,813
Traitor?

760
00:57:21,585 --> 00:57:23,820
I was barely out of my egg when my father

761
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:27,516
fought the battle that freed us from the Allosaurus'. And the people

762
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:30,280
 of Saur City presented him with the key to the city gates.

763
00:57:30,567 --> 00:57:32,566
But one Allosaurus survives.

764
00:57:32,774 --> 00:57:33,773
Mr. Big.

765
00:57:34,568 --> 00:57:36,800
He attacked again and..

766
00:57:37,387 --> 00:57:39,453
my father made a deal with him.

767
00:57:39,793 --> 00:57:42,960
He turned over a source city right in front of the city gates.

768
00:57:43,101 --> 00:57:45,440
They left this key lying in the dirt.

769
00:57:49,650 --> 00:57:51,800
What's so important about the dumb tower?

770
00:57:52,233 --> 00:57:53,933
Nobody knows for sure.

771
00:57:54,029 --> 00:57:57,879
All I know is this is the last good thing left of my father.

772
00:57:59,783 --> 00:58:03,560
You see Timmy, this world's not so perfect.

773
00:58:04,729 --> 00:58:06,120
Guess none of them are.

774
00:58:16,674 --> 00:58:18,920
Tonight's your lucky night.

775
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:22,603
You get to see Link start action with his big club.

776
00:58:22,628 --> 00:58:25,627
Yeah, that's not the kind of action I had in mind.

777
00:58:25,652 --> 00:58:27,840
How's about a good luck kiss?

778
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:30,619
You big lug.

779
00:58:49,847 --> 00:58:50,952
Let's go, fellas.

780
00:58:51,088 --> 00:58:52,480
Get out of the way.

781
00:58:53,174 --> 00:58:55,400
Knock 'em dead, Rockie.

782
00:59:09,939 --> 00:59:11,240
Did you hear something?

783
00:59:15,813 --> 00:59:17,680
Get up in the tree house.

784
00:59:32,393 --> 00:59:33,800
Come on!!

785
00:59:34,766 --> 00:59:35,700
Timmy?

786
00:59:35,927 --> 00:59:36,686
Rex?

787
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:37,660
Timmy..

788
00:59:38,153 --> 00:59:39,193
Rex, over here.

789
00:59:40,041 --> 00:59:41,040
Where are you?

790
00:59:45,134 --> 00:59:46,840
Got to go up to the tree house.

791
00:59:52,001 --> 00:59:53,960
Go, go, Timmy, run, get out of here.

792
00:59:55,228 --> 00:59:56,760
With you now pal.

793
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:03,120
THUNDERIN'!!

794
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:09,520
Ow!

795
01:00:15,633 --> 01:00:16,753
come on, boys!

796
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:27,300
Gimme claw!

797
01:00:29,306 --> 01:00:31,106
We laid 'em out like turtles.

798
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:47,240
THUNDERIN'!!

799
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:27,206
Ah! Gimme claw!

800
01:01:28,233 --> 01:01:28,806
Tops?

801
01:01:35,974 --> 01:01:38,400
Come on, Tops, company's coming.

802
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,100
Oh my caps, and I just paid them off.

803
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:44,880
Come on, Tops. Tops?

804
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:48,920
Oh no. Not again. Come on, Tops, they're getting away.

805
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:52,560
Who, hit me?

806
01:01:53,653 --> 01:01:54,826
Boy, does that smart.

807
01:02:02,013 --> 01:02:03,680
AH! NO!

808
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:04,827
GET AWAY!!

809
01:02:19,780 --> 01:02:21,627
Where you goin'? Get after them.

810
01:02:23,853 --> 01:02:26,287
Mr. Big wants to see you now.

811
01:02:28,153 --> 01:02:28,713
Oh, no.

812
01:02:31,827 --> 01:02:33,640
Get away, you Rockie.

813
01:02:41,993 --> 01:02:46,000
What is that power? I must have that device

814
01:02:46,976 --> 01:02:50,406
Keep an eye out for those saurs. They could be hiding anyplace.

815
01:02:51,806 --> 01:02:53,733
I wanted to see me, Mr. Big?

816
01:02:53,758 --> 01:02:55,386
What's happening, Link?

817
01:02:55,581 --> 01:02:57,580
Why isn't this over by now?

818
01:02:57,976 --> 01:02:59,420
I don't know, Sir.

819
01:03:00,001 --> 01:03:04,000
They seem to have some kind of power. Our men seem helpless.

820
01:03:04,001 --> 01:03:06,000
I want it badly.

821
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:07,433
I know, but, th..

822
01:03:07,513 --> 01:03:10,076
I want it now, Link!

823
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:11,766
NOW!!.

824
01:03:11,791 --> 01:03:12,500
Yes, Sir.

825
01:03:18,274 --> 01:03:19,685
Mick, get out of the way.

826
01:03:22,647 --> 01:03:24,120
There's too many we're dead.

827
01:03:27,687 --> 01:03:28,686
It's okay, Nick.

828
01:03:28,711 --> 01:03:29,710
Got the remote control.

829
01:03:31,226 --> 01:03:32,200
How'd you do that?

830
01:03:33,657 --> 01:03:35,407
Come on, let's get back the dock.

831
01:03:38,833 --> 01:03:41,733
- Stay here, I'm gonna check on Jamie.
- Okay.

832
01:03:43,107 --> 01:03:46,193
- Wait! Where's Rex and Tops?
- I don't know, you better wait for them.

833
01:03:59,114 --> 01:04:00,113
Help!

834
01:04:00,138 --> 01:04:01,330
Let go of me, you ape!

835
01:04:01,554 --> 01:04:02,553
Put me down.

836
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:05,200
You'll be sorry, you, Neanderthal!

837
01:04:05,316 --> 01:04:07,840
Hey, what's with all the ruckus?

838
01:04:08,468 --> 01:04:09,467
Where's Timmy?

839
01:04:09,492 --> 01:04:11,491
You mean, you guys don't know where he is?

840
01:04:11,516 --> 01:04:13,040
The Rockies must've gotten Timmy.

841
01:04:13,065 --> 01:04:14,807
I could hear him screaming for help.

842
01:04:14,917 --> 01:04:16,440
That means they got the remote too.

843
01:04:18,754 --> 01:04:19,753
What's a remote?

844
01:04:20,075 --> 01:04:22,080
You know, the thing Timmy was zapping everybody with.

845
01:04:22,296 --> 01:04:25,246
They'll take it to Mr. Big, and then we're really in trouble.

846
01:04:25,436 --> 01:04:27,520
He's right, they'll take him to the tower.

847
01:04:27,626 --> 01:04:30,760
Hey, if we're going in there, we better go in undercover.

848
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:32,700
But how?

849
01:04:33,340 --> 01:04:34,293
Come on.

850
01:04:46,940 --> 01:04:47,927
Come on!

851
01:04:48,767 --> 01:04:50,786
Gimme that, you green gorilla!

852
01:04:52,150 --> 01:04:53,000
Ow!

853
01:04:53,001 --> 01:04:55,440
That's it, huh? Doesn't look like much.

854
01:04:56,001 --> 01:04:58,080
Maybe we should test it first.

855
01:04:59,001 --> 01:05:01,520
Wait! That's it. We're over!

856
01:05:01,544 --> 01:05:04,527
There's definately something missing, Link.

857
01:05:05,787 --> 01:05:07,469
Tell me how this works, or I'll pat you with

858
01:05:07,493 --> 01:05:09,653
steak sauce, and throw you to the meat eaters

859
01:05:10,001 --> 01:05:11,446
You don't scare me, Link.

860
01:05:11,499 --> 01:05:12,766
I'll never tell.

861
01:05:13,337 --> 01:05:14,336
Oh, really?

862
01:05:14,361 --> 01:05:16,707
Then maybe Mr. Big will give you a reward.

863
01:05:25,001 --> 01:05:27,000
Hurry, there's not much time.

864
01:05:31,741 --> 01:05:33,100
Going down!

865
01:05:36,734 --> 01:05:38,733
I sure hope Timmy's down here.

866
01:05:39,068 --> 01:05:40,067
Dungeon!

867
01:05:43,001 --> 01:05:44,246
Sub-basement.

868
01:05:44,433 --> 01:05:45,833
Check it out, Mick.

869
01:06:11,521 --> 01:06:12,520
There's only two of 'em.

870
01:06:12,989 --> 01:06:15,200
They sitting beneath a bell. Looks like some kind of alarm.

871
01:06:15,453 --> 01:06:17,837
Hey, Mick, is that Rhamphorhynchus in your coat?

872
01:06:17,861 --> 01:06:19,274
Are you just happy to see me?

873
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:24,600
would you cut with the jokes I'm roasting in here?

874
01:06:25,133 --> 01:06:26,539
Look, we gotta figure out a way to

875
01:06:26,564 --> 01:06:28,611
lure those sentries away from the bell.

876
01:06:28,774 --> 01:06:30,931
Hey, I got an idea.

877
01:06:36,001 --> 01:06:38,393
Uh-Uh, uh.. No way, guys. Uh-Uh.

878
01:06:56,086 --> 01:06:57,060
Excuse me, boys?

879
01:06:58,820 --> 01:07:01,793
I was looking for somebody who was supposed to be getting off.

880
01:07:03,896 --> 01:07:05,440
Duty, I mean.

881
01:07:07,436 --> 01:07:10,786
I was really counting on some company tonight.

882
01:07:15,207 --> 01:07:17,787
Now, now, boys, there's no need to fight.

883
01:07:18,508 --> 01:07:21,960
We can all party together, right?

884
01:07:23,646 --> 01:07:24,746
Come on.

885
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:27,320
I don't like to wait.

886
01:07:35,314 --> 01:07:36,306
Yes!

887
01:07:37,481 --> 01:07:38,480
Thunderin'.

888
01:07:41,566 --> 01:07:45,000
You were supposed to lure 'em back so that we can knock 'em out.

889
01:07:45,250 --> 01:07:48,160
Sorry, guys, guess I didn't need the help.

890
01:07:49,953 --> 01:07:51,753
I like her style.

891
01:07:57,973 --> 01:07:59,673
Little Miss Muffet.

892
01:07:59,950 --> 01:08:01,380
Makes her first knockout.

893
01:08:04,887 --> 01:08:05,866
- Timmy?
- Timmy?

894
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:07,913
Timmy?

895
01:08:09,633 --> 01:08:10,800
I'm coming.

896
01:08:10,825 --> 01:08:11,824
I'll get you out.

897
01:08:12,001 --> 01:08:13,200
Okay, hold on.

898
01:08:13,740 --> 01:08:15,000
Ease it up a little bit.

899
01:08:15,001 --> 01:08:16,000
Timmy.

900
01:08:16,001 --> 01:08:17,000
Here we go.

901
01:08:17,001 --> 01:08:18,000
Timmy.

902
01:08:18,326 --> 01:08:19,660
Oh, boy.

903
01:08:20,462 --> 01:08:21,812
Rex.

904
01:08:26,046 --> 01:08:28,846
Don't you recognize me, Rex?

905
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:36,773
How ironic, my father was a traitor in a prison of his own making.

906
01:08:36,797 --> 01:08:41,680
I know this will be hard for you to accept Rex, but please hear me out.

907
01:08:41,705 --> 01:08:45,704
Big allied with the forces of the Rockies.

908
01:08:45,732 --> 01:08:49,579
And he had a potion that could bend anyone to his will.

909
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:50,979
You were drugged?

910
01:08:50,979 --> 01:08:54,699
And forced.. to hand Saur City over.

911
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:57,759
The only thing that's kept me going all these years

912
01:08:57,759 --> 01:08:59,439
is thinking of you, Rex.

913
01:09:02,001 --> 01:09:03,000
Father.

914
01:09:11,113 --> 01:09:15,000
No, there's no time. We must destroy the tower.

915
01:09:20,660 --> 01:09:23,860
There is one last chance to stop him.

916
01:09:24,526 --> 01:09:25,926
Help me, Rex.

917
01:09:31,260 --> 01:09:33,760
Jamie, give me the keys quick. We've got work to do.

918
01:09:35,001 --> 01:09:38,760
Beneath our feet is an immense lava pool held back by a cap.

919
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:41,600
It will take me a few more moments to open it.

920
01:09:43,567 --> 01:09:44,693
I'll help you.

921
01:09:44,718 --> 01:09:45,486
No.

922
01:09:45,674 --> 01:09:47,480
You must help your friends.

923
01:09:47,505 --> 01:09:48,504
I'll follow you soon.

924
01:09:49,050 --> 01:09:51,000
Come on, Rex. We're gotta to go.

925
01:09:51,450 --> 01:09:53,000
It's the only way.

926
01:09:55,533 --> 01:09:56,767
Father!

927
01:10:07,875 --> 01:10:12,426
Oh.. Help.. Please..

928
01:10:12,540 --> 01:10:15,746
Come on, hurry. You guys go ahead.

929
01:10:15,770 --> 01:10:17,879
I'll work down here and then take the next car up.

930
01:10:18,086 --> 01:10:19,440
Come on, come on.

931
01:10:19,620 --> 01:10:20,619
Comming...

932
01:10:26,001 --> 01:10:28,507
Now, all we got to do is find that fuse.

933
01:10:28,643 --> 01:10:29,593
And Timmy.

934
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:32,000
You guys realize how big this tower is?

935
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:34,150
Where do you even start to look for either one?

936
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:37,139
Dungeon.

937
01:10:37,163 --> 01:10:38,343
This is your floor.

938
01:10:40,259 --> 01:10:42,612
This is your last chance.

939
01:10:42,636 --> 01:10:44,786
How does it work?

940
01:10:45,218 --> 01:10:46,746
Go jump inti a tar pit.

941
01:10:46,770 --> 01:10:48,233
Enough of this!

942
01:10:48,258 --> 01:10:49,952
Give him the potion.

943
01:10:51,287 --> 01:10:52,200
No.

944
01:10:53,519 --> 01:10:56,524
You won't use it the way you did against my father, Big.

945
01:10:56,549 --> 01:10:59,309
Well, this is an unexpected pleasure.

946
01:10:59,452 --> 01:11:01,458
The son of Cain, I presume.

947
01:11:01,482 --> 01:11:04,116
And as in ineffectual as your father.

948
01:11:04,140 --> 01:11:08,250
- Don't come any closer if you value this little ape.
- No, no, don't listen to him!

949
01:11:08,274 --> 01:11:09,587
Get ready to grab that rope.

950
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:24,640
Not this time..

951
01:11:29,527 --> 01:11:31,240
Useless fool.

952
01:11:31,653 --> 01:11:33,253
You better hide, Forry.

953
01:11:34,580 --> 01:11:35,579
The remote.

954
01:11:38,773 --> 01:11:40,860
Not so fast

955
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:42,501
Hand it over.

956
01:11:42,526 --> 01:11:43,000
No.

957
01:11:55,913 --> 01:11:48,373
I got it now..

958
01:11:55,913 --> 01:11:57,760
Way to go, Doll!

959
01:11:58,087 --> 01:12:00,600
- Top Floor!
- Uh, money please.

960
01:12:01,366 --> 01:12:04,480
- Okay, okay.
- Thank you very much! Top flloor.

961
01:12:09,767 --> 01:12:10,766
Get 'em, Rex.

962
01:12:11,474 --> 01:12:12,473
Come on, Rex.

963
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:20,833
Throw him into the pit.

964
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:25,333
Step, please.

965
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:29,160
Tops!

966
01:12:30,353 --> 01:12:31,473
Hold on, Mick!

967
01:12:35,047 --> 01:12:37,240
TIMMY!!

968
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:44,373
You okay, Timmy?

969
01:12:46,047 --> 01:12:47,186
Are you alright, kid?

970
01:12:47,186 --> 01:12:48,386
Yeah, help Rex.

971
01:12:48,410 --> 01:12:50,046
Rex! I'll be right there, pal!

972
01:12:58,933 --> 01:13:00,227
Get 'em, guys!

973
01:13:00,987 --> 01:13:04,126
You hairless, humanoid, little bimbette.

974
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:07,126
Technically, you neanderthal trollop..

975
01:13:09,433 --> 01:13:11,200
Wait, Timmy.. batteries.

976
01:13:14,673 --> 01:13:15,846
Go get it, Timmy.

977
01:13:46,133 --> 01:13:48,260
Over here, nope, over here!

978
01:13:49,227 --> 01:13:50,840
Sorry..

979
01:13:56,793 --> 01:13:58,473
This is for Saur City!

980
01:14:00,173 --> 01:14:02,107
And this one's for my father.

981
01:14:10,939 --> 01:14:11,800
Hey, Big!

982
01:14:15,027 --> 01:14:15,987
Later, Dude!

983
01:14:20,979 --> 01:14:21,866
Wow.

984
01:14:23,159 --> 01:14:26,673
Good shot, kid. Beat me to it.

985
01:14:29,153 --> 01:14:30,193
I'm free..

986
01:14:32,387 --> 01:14:33,413
I'm free!!

987
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:41,619
Gimme claw.

988
01:14:42,993 --> 01:14:46,040
That guy was the pits. Hope that's where he went.

989
01:14:46,233 --> 01:14:48,700
Guys, we got a problem here.

990
01:14:48,887 --> 01:14:49,927
What's wrong?

991
01:14:50,001 --> 01:14:52,567
This fuse is the power for the whole building.

992
01:14:52,647 --> 01:14:55,547
If I disconnect it, the elevators won't work.

993
01:14:55,572 --> 01:14:56,522
So we'll take the stairs.

994
01:14:56,547 --> 01:14:58,740
But we can't take the stairs. This is too tight.

995
01:14:58,853 --> 01:15:01,746
We've got just enough time to make it back to Saur City.

996
01:15:01,771 --> 01:15:03,360
You bet we'll make it.

997
01:15:03,385 --> 01:15:04,293
But how?

998
01:15:04,318 --> 01:15:06,201
You guys take the elevator now, and I'll

999
01:15:06,225 --> 01:15:08,547
fly the fuse down when you reach the bottom.

1000
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:11,886
- But Forry. You can't.
- Come on, Timmy.

1001
01:15:11,911 --> 01:15:12,623
Let's get out of here.

1002
01:15:12,648 --> 01:15:14,353
Look, kid, your concern is touching.

1003
01:15:14,378 --> 01:15:16,280
To say nothing of a new direction.

1004
01:15:16,305 --> 01:15:17,800
But get out of here now.

1005
01:15:19,575 --> 01:15:21,180
Good luck, handsome.

1006
01:15:24,476 --> 01:15:26,426
Hubba, hubba.

1007
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:28,000
Happy landing.

1008
01:15:28,001 --> 01:15:29,000
Wow.

1009
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:32,380
What are you doing with them?

1010
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:34,000
EVOLVING!!

1011
01:15:35,667 --> 01:15:38,273
That's one giant leap for woman kind.

1012
01:15:38,732 --> 01:15:40,286
Help that elevator.

1013
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:44,772
Ground floor, going down.

1014
01:15:45,526 --> 01:15:50,513
Oh, my God.

1015
01:15:50,538 --> 01:15:54,537
Hey, uh, I'm sorry. I hope I didn't rough you up too bad.

1016
01:15:54,674 --> 01:15:55,673
That's okay.

1017
01:15:56,050 --> 01:15:57,940
The more on our side, the better.

1018
01:16:17,057 --> 01:16:18,480
Ground floor.

1019
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:25,360
Get out of my way.

1020
01:16:48,227 --> 01:16:50,000
Hey, can you see Forry?

1021
01:16:56,053 --> 01:16:58,033
Talk about a crash course.

1022
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:01,973
Come on, Forry, use your wings and fly!

1023
01:17:08,394 --> 01:17:10,160
Well, here goes nothing.

1024
01:17:19,561 --> 01:17:21,280
I can still fly!

1025
01:17:22,140 --> 01:17:24,374
Hey, meet you in Saur City.

1026
01:17:34,587 --> 01:17:36,160
Oh, I knew your could do it.

1027
01:17:36,184 --> 01:17:37,547
My hero..

1028
01:17:38,174 --> 01:17:40,120
Quick, guys, let's take the train.

1029
01:17:48,327 --> 01:17:49,387
Get aboard.

1030
01:17:49,647 --> 01:17:50,560
Father.

1031
01:17:51,854 --> 01:17:52,507
Rex..

1032
01:17:53,641 --> 01:17:54,640
We gotta go.

1033
01:18:11,001 --> 01:18:12,367
What are we waiting for, Tops?

1034
01:18:12,392 --> 01:18:14,391
Nothing anymore, pal.

1035
01:18:26,780 --> 01:18:28,107
Get out of my way.

1036
01:18:38,620 --> 01:18:40,619
I'm sorry, Rex.

1037
01:19:17,220 --> 01:19:20,520
He-he-he, I'm flying, he-he-he.

1038
01:19:24,673 --> 01:19:26,033
We made it.

1039
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:30,666
Rex, you know he's a hero again, don't you?

1040
01:19:31,780 --> 01:19:37,000
But he's gone now, and, I've been wrong all these years.

1041
01:19:37,025 --> 01:19:38,663
But Rex, that doesn't matter now.

1042
01:19:39,176 --> 01:19:40,726
You know the truth.

1043
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:43,466
You'll have a good memories of him for the rest of your life.

1044
01:19:49,063 --> 01:19:50,053
Come on, hurry.

1045
01:19:50,681 --> 01:19:51,726
Right behind you, Rex.

1046
01:19:51,751 --> 01:19:52,719
Hope Forry made it.

1047
01:19:52,743 --> 01:19:54,213
Hey, wait up.

1048
01:20:11,060 --> 01:20:12,093
Allow me.

1049
01:20:22,881 --> 01:20:24,880
Way to go, sister.

1050
01:20:25,436 --> 01:20:27,453
It's about time you guys got here.

1051
01:20:27,477 --> 01:20:29,126
He's stinking up the place.

1052
01:20:29,150 --> 01:20:31,000
I think I got this just about fixed.

1053
01:20:31,001 --> 01:20:32,000
Are we gonna make it?

1054
01:20:32,001 --> 01:20:33,000
I hope so.

1055
01:20:33,150 --> 01:20:36,000
If not, we're all gonna be doing the molten mambo.

1056
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:38,000
Sure, you don't need any help with this?

1057
01:20:38,075 --> 01:20:39,567
It's gonna be like a only world back home.

1058
01:20:39,628 --> 01:20:40,507
That's okay.

1059
01:20:40,532 --> 01:20:41,619
I almost got it.

1060
01:20:47,213 --> 01:20:51,240
Well, you're king of the dinosaurs now.

1061
01:20:58,793 --> 01:21:02,420
Remember, Jamie, we'll always have Tar Town.

1062
01:21:03,001 --> 01:21:04,000
Good luck, Rex.

1063
01:21:04,001 --> 01:21:05,000
Kick some tail, huh?

1064
01:21:05,001 --> 01:21:06,000
You got it.

1065
01:21:08,614 --> 01:21:10,613
I'm gonna stay with you, Rex

1066
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:14,640
I could be your scout, you know, take care of stuff for you.

1067
01:21:15,450 --> 01:21:17,000
I'm even pretty good in the fight now.

1068
01:21:17,250 --> 01:21:19,720
Timmy, what about the people in our world that would miss you?

1069
01:21:21,450 --> 01:21:23,000
Don't we count for anything?

1070
01:21:23,293 --> 01:21:25,200
Or is this still just Timmy first?

1071
01:21:25,823 --> 01:21:27,773
You guys would actually miss me?

1072
01:21:28,180 --> 01:21:29,400
Of course we would.

1073
01:21:29,953 --> 01:21:31,200
So would your parents.

1074
01:21:32,140 --> 01:21:33,180
They love you, Timmy.

1075
01:21:33,861 --> 01:21:35,660
The decisions up to you, Timmy.

1076
01:21:35,685 --> 01:21:37,398
Think hard, Timmy.

1077
01:21:39,008 --> 01:21:41,560
Come on, I want to be a part of something.

1078
01:21:42,150 --> 01:21:46,000
You are, you always have been, but you have to go back.

1079
01:21:46,406 --> 01:21:47,806
We'll miss you too.

1080
01:21:47,913 --> 01:21:49,480
Here, take this.

1081
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:52,202
This way you'll always have the key.

1082
01:21:52,226 --> 01:21:55,000
Go, go and be a king in your own world.

1083
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:57,433
I'll be back, someday.

1084
01:22:04,450 --> 01:22:08,000
Come here, come here and give the Missy a kiss goodbye.

1085
01:22:08,970 --> 01:22:10,820
Keep cool, kiddo.

1086
01:22:12,827 --> 01:22:14,727
I almost got it.

1087
01:22:15,893 --> 01:22:18,040
IT WORKS!!

1088
01:22:24,528 --> 01:22:25,726
For Saur City, maybe.

1089
01:22:25,751 --> 01:22:26,750
Not for us.

1090
01:22:27,433 --> 01:22:28,833
I don't get it.

1091
01:22:30,116 --> 01:22:32,240
Maybe you'll get your wish after all, Timmy.

1092
01:22:32,557 --> 01:22:35,407
Come on, Timmy. There's gotta be another way out of here.

1093
01:22:37,390 --> 01:22:38,440
Maybe there is.

1094
01:22:39,853 --> 01:22:44,840
In fact, maybe the answer's not the fuse.

1095
01:22:50,023 --> 01:22:51,873
Well, it's worth a shot.

1096
01:22:51,916 --> 01:22:53,866
Use it wisely, kid.

1097
01:23:01,767 --> 01:23:03,520
THUNDERIN'!!

1098
01:23:07,461 --> 01:23:08,460
Goodbye, Timmy.

1099
01:23:08,767 --> 01:23:09,766
Goodbye, Rex.

1100
01:23:21,892 --> 01:23:23,053
Bye.

1101
01:23:32,867 --> 01:23:34,000
Don't wait, Timmy.

1102
01:23:35,668 --> 01:23:37,667
Don't go, please.

1103
01:23:38,001 --> 01:23:39,760
What about all the fun we had?

1104
01:23:39,854 --> 01:23:42,240
Don't you wanna stick around for a while?

1105
01:24:21,114 --> 01:24:22,000
Timmy?

1106
01:24:24,667 --> 01:24:25,513
Timmy?

1107
01:24:26,574 --> 01:24:27,573
Where is he?

1108
01:24:27,794 --> 01:24:28,793
Don't know.

1109
01:24:29,001 --> 01:24:31,000
Thought he was right behind us.

1110
01:24:31,024 --> 01:24:33,392
My gosh, he didn't make it back through.

1111
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:40,330
You alright?

1112
01:24:40,354 --> 01:24:41,120
Are you okay?

1113
01:24:41,687 --> 01:24:42,353
Yeah.

1114
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:47,280
He check out the tube.

1115
01:24:48,025 --> 01:24:51,000
Wanna light?, Wanna light? Wanna light? Wanna light?

1116
01:24:53,050 --> 01:24:56,000
You can turn that thing off, better than you turned it on.

1117
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,241
Come on, you guys, let's go.

1118
01:25:37,620 --> 01:25:39,026
Timmy, are you all right?

1119
01:25:39,050 --> 01:25:40,153
Yeah, we're great.

1120
01:25:40,780 --> 01:25:43,380
Well.. Ah, who dressed you kids?

1121
01:25:44,126 --> 01:25:45,826
Mr. Big's Dungeon.

1122
01:25:46,001 --> 01:25:46,753
What's that?

1123
01:25:47,001 --> 01:25:49,000
Is that a new shop with the mall?

1124
01:25:49,001 --> 01:25:50,000
What? You don't like it?

1125
01:25:50,140 --> 01:25:51,860
It's the newest thing in fashion.

1126
01:25:51,885 --> 01:25:53,580
Whatever to jeans and t-shirts.

1127
01:25:53,933 --> 01:25:56,126
Wait, so how was conference?

1128
01:25:56,150 --> 01:25:57,407
Oh, ah.

1129
01:25:58,263 --> 01:25:59,813
Well, they didn't believe us.

1130
01:25:59,874 --> 01:26:01,873
They thought it was a new way to make orange juice.

1131
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:03,941
So I'm afraid we have a lot of work

1132
01:26:03,966 --> 01:26:06,000
to do before we send a human through.

1133
01:26:08,963 --> 01:26:10,106
What's so funny?

1134
01:26:10,666 --> 01:26:13,683
Dad, don't be mad, but I gotta show you the raddest thing.

1135
01:26:13,707 --> 01:26:16,779
Come on, come on, you're not gonna believe this.

1136
01:26:16,804 --> 01:26:17,803
You're not gonna believe this.

1137
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:20,499
Did you go in the lab?

1138
01:26:20,524 --> 01:26:22,544
We told you not to go in the lab.
