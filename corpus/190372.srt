The things I touch are made of stone

192
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:47,079
Falling through this night alone

193
00:42:51,375 --> 00:42:58,179
Love don't go away

194
00:42:58,399 --> 00:43:02,489
Come back this way

195
00:43:03,282 --> 00:43:12,286
Come back and stay
Forever...

196
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:17,697
and ever

197
00:43:20,778 --> 00:43:22,612
Please stay

198
00:43:55,854 --> 00:44:00,659
Dust is dancing in the space

199
00:44:07,438 --> 00:44:13,325
A dog and bird are far away

200
00:44:19,671 --> 00:44:25,613
The sun comes up and down each day

201
00:44:31,235 --> 00:44:40,057
The river flows out to the sea

202
00:44:43,527 --> 00:44:50,313
Love don't go away

203
00:44:50,735 --> 00:44:55,063
Come back this way

204
00:44:55,540 --> 00:45:04,251
Come back and stay
Forever...

205
00:45:04,315 --> 00:45:09,945
and ever

206
00:46:02,424 --> 00:46:10,376
The world spins
