1
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,020
Please! Please!

2
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,300
No! No!

3
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,500
No! No!

4
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,900
Steven!

5
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,000
Get on your knees and pray to me.

6
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:46,900
You obey. I command. Just as it was before.

7
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,300
Now get on your knees.

8
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,900
Amen.

9
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:55,340
In Evans City, Pennsylvania. What started as an innocent Saturday

10
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:59,000
afternoon picnic in the woods turned into a nightmare.

11
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:03,200
Six friends went into the woods together. One came out alive.

12
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:09,500
The survivor was Vikki Tonatair, and she has one disturbing story to tell.

13
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:16,300
Two people wearing Halloween masks made me watch some kind of ceremony

14
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:22,900
in some kind of arena or something. A man was being brought body parts

15
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,800
and glasses and what looked like blood... Like they were awards for him or something.

16
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:36,500
The people in the masks were clapping. Then the man raised his hands and there was an earthquake.

17
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:42,400
And everything came crashing down all around me. The people in the masks ran off.

18
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:50,000
The man who was on stage came after me. He tried to strangle me with a wire.

19
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,970
Medical experts are speculating that Vikki Tonatair and her five friends

20
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:59,300
were attacked, kidnapped, and - with the exception on Vikki - murdered.

21
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,770
Vikki's nightmarish memories are being blamed on hallucinogenic

22
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:07,600
drugs she was given by her attackers. Authorities are considering the possibility

23
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:10,900
that this event is an example of cult activity.

24
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,700
That's what Buck said. If Troutman owns the other buildings then maybe he'll give us some sort of special treatment,

25
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,600
considering he kind of owes us.

26
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,500
Hey Aaron. Come on in.

27
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,100
Thanks.

28
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,100
We're all here because of Buck, our maintenance guy?

29
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:32,500
Yep.

30
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,100
What's he got to tell us that's so important?

31
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,400
He said something about saving the building and keeping us from all moving out.

32
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,600
Hit me with it at about two o'clock this afternoon.

33
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,400
Said get everybody in the building together so we can talk about it.

34
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,300
Well, we're all here. So where's Buck?

35
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,300
Late.

36
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,200
Alison. Hear my voice.

37
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:21,300
I... I hear you. Where... where have you taken me?

38
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:28,800
You have brought yourself through this passage. However, it is necessary to interrupt your course.

39
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
We have a mission for you to undertake.

40
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,200
Mission? What... what's going on?

41
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:44,900
Alison. You have given up your earthly existence. You are on your way to the afterlife.

42
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,600
There you would pay for your sin and then move on to your next phase.

43
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,900
I have been sent to intercept you.

44
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,300
Sent? By who?

45
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,900
I thought Super Grover kicked some major ass.

46
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,000
Oh, I don't even believe you.

47
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,000
He had to put a helmet on! Come on!

48
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:05,500
So what?

49
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:08,000
Cookie Monster would dive straight in without a helmet.

50
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:11,200
He would go in, he would just chew Grover to bits.

51
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,800
Okay, fine, whatever. I still like Super Grover more.

52
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,900
The Cookie Monster, he didn't give a shit about anything.

53
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,700
He just sat there and devoured the entire store. Alright?

54
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,800
He ate everything in sight.

55
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,200
I mean, he's a big, fat, furry lard ass.

56
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,700
So are you both picky eaters or is one of you just putting up with the other one?

57
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:37,800
He's the picky eater.

58
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:43,000
It's the black olives and shit, alright? I don't... I don't eat shit that's slimy, okay?

59
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:44,400
I've actually had nightmares about it.

60
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:49,400
He's really weird about that stuff. For example, who in this room wets their toothbrush

61
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:51,600
before they put toothpaste on it to brush their teeth?

62
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:57,700
See, my husband is unbalanced. He puts toothpaste on a dry toothbrush and then brushes his teeth.

63
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,500
If it's wet it's fucking gross. Like someone used it before me.

64
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,700
You know his mom wanted him to be a doctor? But I don't think surgery would sit well

65
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:07,600
with somebody who gets grossed out by slimy vegetables and wet toothbrushes.

66
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:16,200
I have been sent by all the angels in heaven and by all the devils in Hell.

67
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,900
We all need you, Alison.

68
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,800
Hidden magic once pulsed within your planet.

69
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:30,900
Royal sorcerers commanded this magic and kept their kings and queens in secure command.

70
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,500
These wizards were paid illustriously for their supernatural services.

71
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,300
In this age of kingdoms ruled by magic power lived an evil wizard named Ambolin.

72
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:51,300
Ambolin was a failure at his craft, unable to command soil or soul.

73
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:56,900
Consequently, his king and queen fell from power and were killed.

74
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,800
There was a young jester named Abraham, who was also employed by the castle.

75
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:08,000
When the king and queen died, Abraham was taken in by the wizard.

76
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,800
Abraham soon became Ambolin's apprentice.

77
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:20,600
Ambolin decided to journey to another land, a new world born of sorcery and filled with atrocity.

78
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:27,900
Abraham was passionately devoted to his master and desperately wished to join him on this journey.

79
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,500
Ambolin commanded his apprentice to prove his devotion.

80
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:39,200
Abraham was instructed to murder the woman he loved. Abraham obeyed.

81
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,700
Ambolin and his appretice celebrated the murder by drinking of the dead girl's blood.

82
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:53,200
The blood of Abraham's lover turned to salt in their throats and dried up their hearts.

83
00:22:54,800 --> 00:23:01,600
The wizard and his apprentice escaped this world, leaving behind the stinging memories of failure.

84
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:08,400
But they were not taken by death. They entered another world created by Ambolin.

85
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:14,700
Within this unnatural reality, Ambolin could finally take a ruling position,

86
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:17,400
entertained by the torment of humans.

87
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:26,600
Ambolin's new world was contained in it's own dimension, an abomination of natural time and space.

88
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:31,900
Ambolin reached up to the sun and scraped ice from it's surface.

89
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:37,700
These frozen chunks and slivers melted in Ambolin's grasp.

90
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:47,200
The resulting ocean surrounded Ambolin's dimension. Once in place, the water again froze,

91
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:53,700
creating six walls of ice that contained Ambolin's unnatural reality.

92
00:23:54,800 --> 00:24:01,600
Thus began a cycle that would continue to take life after life within the frozen walls.

93
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:09,600
Every few years, six humans would be chosen from the earth and delivered through the ice.

94
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,560
These humans would be brought into Ambolin's world and challenged

95
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:20,100
with impossible contests, playing against Ambolin's apprentice.

96
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:27,400
Ambolin would savor each player's torment, eagerly anticipating their eventual death.

97
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:32,500
The apprentice gained more and more assistance with each killing.

98
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:36,400
When a human died, their soul would not leave.

99
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:42,300
It would be trapped by the ice and could then be manipulated by the apprentice.

100
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,700
He could reincarnate any soul, dictate the being's actions,

101
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:50,800
and use this being against a human victim.

102
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:57,500
This cycle continued until the apprentice made a detrimental error.

103
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:03,900
He was confronting the sixth human of a recent round, a man named Steven.

104
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,500
Steven was to be tricked into believing the apprentice was dead,

105
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:13,300
then enticed with a proposal of commanding Ambolin's world himself.

106
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,300
While this deception was planned for Steven,

107
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:21,400
the apprentice unintentionally deceived Ambolin as well.

108
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,700
The apprentice found himself trapped in a state of limbo

109
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:31,100
while Ambolin actually granted Steven command of the dimension.

110
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:37,000
The apprentice knew that he had grown powerful enough to destroy Ambolin.

111
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:44,500
But he had never before considered this option, as his devotion to Ambolin remained strong.

112
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,940
However, terminating Ambolin's existence was the only way to escape his confines

113
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,600
and return to his former status within the game.

114
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:03,800
The apprentice cried out, his voice turning to flames as it reached the ears of Ambolin.

115
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,300
The fire entered Ambolin's mind and burned away what was left of his soul.

116
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,700
The apprentice was free to resume command.

117
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:22,300
When he took Steven's life, Steven was preparing to kill the sixth victim of his reign.

118
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:29,500
This woman, the only human ever to escape, descended back to earth.

119
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:35,200
With Ambolin destroyed, the apprentice became more powerful than ever,

120
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:41,600
treasuring his status as the single dominating presence in his world.

121
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,000
Dana here is afraid of churches.

122
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:47,700
Who wouldn't be?

123
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,500
Yeah, well, I have actual reasons to be afraid.

124
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,100
Me too. Baptists.

125
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:57,400
No, you don't understand. My father was insane. When I was a little girl,

126
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:01,000
he would drag me to church, telling me the whole way there what a sinner I was.

127
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:06,600
Eventually, Dad was beating the shit out of me, trying to pound some sense into my head.

128
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,800
I was always showing bruises and cigarette burns, scrapes and cuts.

129
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,500
My father would tell me I had to go into the confessional and confess

130
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:24,400
that I had done all that physical abuse to myself.

131
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:29,600
I actually did it. I lied in my confessions.

132
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,500
Now churches just give me the creeps.

133
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:38,000
No one ever found out about it? That it was your dad beating you?

134
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:42,500
They found out when I was still kind of young. I did live with my grandmother for a while.

135
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,900
I went through some sort of kiddie therapy but as I got older I learned

136
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:50,800
just to let it go and say "Fuck you, Dad." I submerged myself in my artwork.

137
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I got stoned a lot. And now I conciously avoid being anything like my father and I stay away from churches.

138
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,900
Strange.

139
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,700
What about you, Matt? You got a phobia? Fear of losing your Legos?

140
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,600
Fear of misplacing your Klingon dictionary?

141
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:08,000
Fear of making a donation to PBS and hearing your name mispronounced on the air?

142
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,300
Fear of losing your autographed photo of Sylvester Stallone?

143
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,300
You know it's a forgery-

144
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:19,000
No. Assholes... Suffocation. That's my phobia.

145
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:25,900
I think suffocation or drowning would be like the worst possible way to die.

146
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,400
I don't think about dying. Doesn't scare me.

147
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,900
Getting maimed, ending up in a wheelchair, getting brain damaged...

148
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:37,300
that's what's fucked. If I can't wipe my own ass, I'd rather be dead.

149
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,800
When I lived in my last apartment, the guy in the place below me had a heart attack and died.

150
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,700
He lived alone, so no one knew he was dead down there until some of the other

151
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:49,400
residents and I started to smell the guy rotting.

152
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,200
He'd been dead two weeks down there before the cops went in to get him.

153
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:59,800
The dead guy had a dog and the cops found the dog standing over the corpse,

154
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:04,740
protecting its owner. They had to get the Humane Society to come and trap the dog

155
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:08,200
because it was growling and snapping at the cops and wouldn't let them near the body.

156
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,600
The dog was still loyal, even though his owner hadn't moved for days.

157
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,800
Oh, that's such a load of bullshit. Don't romanticize the situation.

158
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,300
The dog was protecting it's only supply of food.

159
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:23,200
The mutt obviously hadn't been fed since it's owner died. It had to eat something.

160
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:26,100
They probably found most of the corpse with his hands and face cleaned

161
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:29,600
right to the bones, the dog gulping down that last bit of ear cartilage.

162
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,200
That's reality. That's life on planet earth.

163
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,900
The apprentice must be terminated. The angels in heaven want to end his

164
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:47,200
reign of evil and eliminate forever his corruption of natural time and space.

165
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:52,000
The devils in Hell also desire his destruction.

166
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,200
The devils in Hell also desire his destruction.
A single presence dominating an entire dimension has made the devils extremely jealous.

167
00:29:52,200 --> 00:30:00,600
A single presence dominating an entire dimension has made the devils extremely jealous.

168
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:07,400
But even with our combined desires to eliminate his presence, none of us,

169
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:14,300
the angels nor the devils, can enter his realm. We need an assassin.

170
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
We need you, Alison.

171
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I... How? How can I be? I'm a human.

172
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,700
I couldn't possibly be as powerful as any of you.

173
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:35,500
None of us can penetrate the ice. Only a being that bears flesh and blood can pass through the ice.

174
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:44,100
That is how each set of six humans can enter, but their dead souls remain trapped.

175
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:48,500
It is not too late to place you back into your body.

176
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:57,400
In your earthly state, you can enter the ice. Your infiltration will go unobserved.

177
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:06,100
Another six humans will soon be entering, as well. This activity will mask your arrival.

178
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:11,300
How do I find those humans? What do I do to help them?

179
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:16,700
Those humans are expendable. They are not your concern.

180
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:22,100
Please. I don't... I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

181
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:25,800
I don't understand any of this. I can't do what you think I can do.

182
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:27,900
Believe me. I'm not the one you want.

183
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:33,100
You are arrogant, more so than most others on Earth.

184
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:39,200
Every uneducated speculation you form, you believe to be fact.

185
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:44,200
I do not ask that you have faith in what you cannot sense.

186
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:51,300
What I demand is that you believe in and respect the vastness of what you cannot comprehend.

187
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:59,700
My being as you sense it is a result of your mind, your memories, your subconscious.

188
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,500
That is the only way for me to communicate to you.

189
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:10,200
Projecting my true existence to a human is impossible.

190
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:18,800
It is the same within the ice. Everything you will sense there is derived from your mind.

191
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:24,800
Be warned. You may be subjected to your deepest fears.

192
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,500
He can find terrors you never knew you had.

193
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,200
I watch Pam... a lot.

194
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:43,400
When she leaves. When she comes home. I think she's really cool.

195
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,500
Matt, she's not your type. She gets her money, her transportation, her drugs,

196
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,500
everything comes from her boyfriends.

197
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,300
She fucks a whole lot of guys so she doesn't have to do anything else.

198
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,400
She do it with you?

199
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,500
Couple times a while back. I was dealing a lot more back then.

200
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:02,000
We met up, screwed, and I gave her some stuff two or three times

201
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:05,600
but I decided I needed cash for my stuff, you know?

202
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,600
I couldn't afford to be giving it away just to get laid.

203
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,200
I should get her out of my brain?

204
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,600
Get her out of your brain.

205
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,700
Hey, where the hell is he? I've got better things to do than hang around here.

206
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,200
I doubt that very severely.

207
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,100
Believe it, shit head! I'm a busy man.

208
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,200
You're part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor!

209
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,300
If that ain't Buck...

210
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,200
It's going to be alright. Don't worry about it. Just chill out, Aaron!

211
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,300
Hey buck, don't show up on time or anything. It's not like we've been waiting here all fucking night.

212
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,500
You're late, Buck. What's the deal?

213
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,200
I got tied up a little bit but trust me, it'll be worth it.

214
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:44,400
How do I assassinate him?

215
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:50,600
You cannot kill him yourself. You must make him remember his former life.

216
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:59,700
You must make him recognize that he was once a human, a man capable of experiencing love.

217
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:06,100
If he remembers, the ice containing his realm will begin to melt.

218
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:13,500
The angels and the devils will soar through the openings in the dissolving ice walls.

219
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:18,800
We will enter his domain and destroy him forever.

220
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:23,700
How? How... how can I make him remember?

221
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:30,100
Be patie‪nt, Alison. Go forward. Be strong.

222
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:38,900
All of us are very special. This is an incredible gift.

223
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:43,700
Buck. Our building. Our apartments. Can you help us or not?

224
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,400
Yeah, man. We've been waiting all fucking night.

225
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:56,200
I'm not really sure but I don't think you're going to have to worry about a place to live anymore.

226
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:11,100
I've been working on rearranging, revising.

227
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,500
I've been working really hard on this.

228
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,666
I want it to be perfect.

229
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,400
What the fuck is this?

230
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Take us! Take us! Take us! Take us! Take us!-
-Buck, stop it! What is wrong with you?

231
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,700
I don't believe this shit.-
-Take us!

232
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,800
Take us!-
-Whats wrong with him? Is he sick or something?

233
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:36,100
Take us!-
-We wait around here for hours so he can show up and start acting like a fucking freak?

234
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,300
Take us!-
-Maybe we should call somebody!

235
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,300
Take us!-
-Buck, stop it! Stop it right now!

236
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:42,200
Take us!-
-God damn it! Shut the fuck up!

237
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,900
Excuse me! Hello!

238
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,400
Can you help me out?

239
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,800
Please. I just have some questions.

240
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,500
Look, I'm not from here. I'm looking for someone. A wizard's apprentice.

241
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,900
His name's Abraham or it used to be. I've got to find him.

242
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:16,500
He was brought here by his mentor who he recently killed. His mentor was a wizard named Ambolin.

243
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:20,900
Here, within the ice, I was once very much like you were on Earth.

244
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:31,400
But I chose better who to follow.

245
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,200
Excuse me! I'm looking for-

246
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:09,200
I... uh...

247
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:58,500
Come on, man. Stay with me here. Be tough. I've got something for you.

248
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,200
Okay. Here you go.

249
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,600
That one? That one is going to make your sinuses expand.

250
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:23,100
You're probably already feeling it right now. Your nose is kind of blocked up,

251
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:25,600
finding it kind of hard to breathe?

252
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:30,300
Way, way, way worse than any fuckin' cold you ever had, am I right?

253
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:47,900
Now that one... that one's going to cause your tongue to swell up like a big, red, bumpy balloon.

254
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:29,700
This is Pam. You suck. Leave a message.

255
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,700
Hello? Is somebody there? Pick up, please!

256
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:36,700
Come on! Pick up!

257
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,300
Hello, Pam?-
-Oh, thank God.

258
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:40,200
I need help. I've got to get out of here.-
-Sure, sure.

259
00:53:40,230 --> 00:53:43,360
You've just got to do me a favor first.-
-I must be really fucking hammered. I don't even know where I am.

260
00:53:43,370 --> 00:53:46,300
Pam, I mean it! We'll figure out where you are. I'll come pick you up

261
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:50,800
and I'll bring you home safe and sound but first, I want you to say my name.

262
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:57,000
I... please... just-
-Pam, you don't know who this is.

263
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:01,600
How many guys know where you hide the spare key to your apartment?

264
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:07,700
I feel so used! I feel dirty!

265
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:13,600
Well, I guess I'll come pick you up anyway. I'll be right over.

266
00:54:13,610 --> 00:54:15,400
Wait a minute. You know where I am?

267
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:17,200
I'm right behind you.

268
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:20,300
Don't worry about a thing. You're going to be fine.

269
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:25,800
Like I told you, I'm right behind you.

270
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:34,000
There was one man. Different.

271
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:42,100
He was your savior. He rescued you and your mother.

272
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:46,500
You would have both starved most likely.

273
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:52,800
You were fifteen years old. Do you remember?

274
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:05,200
You knew he wanted your flesh. You gave it willingly.

275
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:12,800
You loved him. His hands on your body, the taste of his skin.

276
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:18,800
Why is this buried so far away, Pamela?

277
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:22,600
What really made this man so different?

278
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,400
Why did this haunt you for many nights after?

279
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:35,900
Why couldn't you sleep? Why couldn't you eat?

280
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:47,400
You loved him.

281
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:58,000
You loved your mother's brother.

282
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:07,900
You were so scared, Pamela. What if your were pregnant? Pregnant with your uncle's offspring.

283
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:13,400
The child couldn't possibly be anything but an inbred monster.

284
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:16,200
What if you were not the first to commit such an act?

285
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:20,100
What if generations ago, blood impregnated blood?

286
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,700
What kind of monsters lurk within you?

287
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:56,600
You can let me go. Please. Please let me go.

288
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,500
I can do things for you.

289
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:13,900
You can let me go. I'm special.

290
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:18,200
Yes, you are. Very special.

291
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Amazing! Amazing! For just a few dollars, you can see it for yourself!

292
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:31,800
A freak of nature! One of God's mistakes! A repulsive beast!

293
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:34,100
You've got to see it to believe it!

294
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:40,200
Amazing! Amazing! For just a few dollars, you can see it for yourself!

295
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:46,100
A freak of nature! One of God's mistakes! A repulsive beast!

296
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:48,500
You've got to see it to believe it!

297
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:54,700
Amazing! Amazing! For just a few dollars, you can see it for yourself!

298
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:00,700
A freak of nature! One of God's mistakes! A repulsive beast!

299
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,900
You've got to see it to believe it!

300
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:09,600
Amazing! Amazing! For just a few dollars, you can see it for yourself!

301
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:15,500
A freak of nature! One of God's mistakes! A repulsive beast!

302
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:17,700
You've got to see it to believe it!

303
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:24,100
Okay! Okay! Everybody out! The laws of society say we've got to kill it!

304
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,400
All ugly things must die!

305
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:29,900
Everybody's got to leave so we can put it out of it's misery!

306
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,800
I... I... don't...

307
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:01,700
You're not... you're not from here.

308
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:23,100
I... I have friends with me. But I think three of them are dead.

309
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:26,700
I don't know how I know.

310
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:33,900
Can I do anything to help the ones that are still alive?

311
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:42,600
I think as far as our world is concerned, all of us are already in our coffins.

312
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:51,900
There's no way? Not at all? Is that how it works in here?

313
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Everywhere.

314
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,900
I don't feel like we're the first.

315
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:00,900
You're perceptive.

316
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:10,100
This has been going on since the Dark Ages. You're just the most recent wave of victims.

317
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:16,600
You're here to be thrown to the lions, killed for someone's entertainment.

318
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:19,800
Can we do anything? Do we have any chance at all?

319
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:22,800
There was one person who got out.

320
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:27,800
It was during some battle for control, some fight over who would rule this dimension.

321
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:31,300
So there is a chance for escape, I guess.

322
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:33,800
So what can we do? How do we find this-

323
01:02:33,810 --> 01:02:37,000
I don't know! I don't understand this place either!

324
01:02:37,050 --> 01:02:38,800
I can't help you! I'm not even supposed to try!

325
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:42,200
What does that mean? Not supposed to try?

326
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:45,800
I was sent in here for a specific reason. A mission.

327
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:53,100
I was told there would be a group of you in here with me. Your deaths are predetermined.

328
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:57,300
If I try to help any of you, I could jeopardize my mission.-
-You've got to try to help us!

329
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:02,000
If you were sent here, you're not like the rest of us. You could help us!

330
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:03,900
You could find a way for us to get out!

331
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
You could challenge whoever runs this place!

332
01:03:06,001 --> 01:03:08,006
What I've got to do is important. I'm not supposed to help you.

333
01:03:08,007 --> 01:03:09,600
I'm supposed to stick to the mission!

334
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:11,850
Fuck your mission! Don't you even care?

335
01:03:11,860 --> 01:03:12,400
I care!

336
01:03:12,410 --> 01:03:13,600
You're not even going to try to help!

337
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:16,300
If I do what I was sent here to do, all of this will disappear.

338
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:19,900
The killing will stop. I'd be saving countless lives!

339
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:31,600
I will try to find my own way out. And if I can't find my way out,

340
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:36,600
if they're going to try to kill me, I'm going to put up a fight.

341
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Well, I wish you luck.

342
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:52,900
In the name of Ambolin, his apprentice, and the power within the ice... Amen.

343
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:06,400
You can't have any of this. It's all mine.

344
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:17,000
Excuse me! It's pretty fucking rude to leave before the performance!

345
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:26,300
You've got to stay for the show. Big fucking presentation.

346
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:30,200
They put a lot of work into it. Beautiful.

347
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:35,100
When they pass the basket, I expect you to donate generously.

348
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:37,900
God damn it, stop that fighting!

349
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,000
If you can't behave, you're going to wait in your fucking cages next time!

350
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:01,800
Time for the show.

351
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:16,600
Dana, get over here with him! You're part of the show! You can drive the nails in.

352
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:21,800
He can see that you're a sinner. He's always watching you, wherever you are!

353
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:30,400
He knows what you do to yourself! You must obey! You must obey! Repent! Repent! Repent!

354
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:36,000
Sinner! You must obey me! Obey!

355
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:23,100
Dana.

356
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,600
Dana, what's going on?

357
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:34,600
Dana!

358
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:03,500
Dana! Dana!

359
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:10,400
Stop it!

360
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:13,300
Stop it!

361
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:24,100
You mother fucker! Stop! God damn it! You fucking coward!

362
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:27,700
Stop it! Stop!

363
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:35,200
Stop! Stop! Stop it! God damn it, you mother fucker!

364
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:40,900
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

365
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:44,100
Let her go! God damn you!

366
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:38,100
You can save her.

367
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,700
You fucking coward.

368
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:43,900
Control yourself, Keith. Concentrate.

369
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:53,400
Fix her.

370
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:19,500
Babe. Dana.

371
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,800
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

372
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Dana...?

373
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:02,400
No...

374
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:23,200
Those are worms squirming around inside your mouth.

375
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:29,800
Already, they are secreting toxins. If you swallow, your stomach acid may kill them.

376
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:33,200
If you try to keep them in your mouth, their secretions will

377
01:19:33,210 --> 01:19:37,500
poison your brain and you will lose bodily control. You won't have a chance.

378
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:45,500
Keith, try to kill them.

379
01:19:54,100 --> 01:19:59,060
Now in your stomach, they could die. However, if they don't, they may be

380
01:19:59,070 --> 01:20:02,800
stimulated to secrete greater amounts of toxins that will circulate

381
01:20:02,900 --> 01:20:07,100
through your system very rapidly. You may begin to hallucinate.

382
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:14,300
You may experience muscle spasms. Your lungs and heart may fail.-
-Dr. Dana, you have a call on line six.

383
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:17,400
Dr. Dana, you have a call on line six.

384
01:20:17,410 --> 01:20:18,800
I'll be back to check on you later.

385
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,600
Two months ago, thirty-seven year old post office employee, John Q. Anyman,

386
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:12,000
opened fire on his family with an illegal handgun.

387
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:15,400
He massacred his thirty-two year old wife, Jane, and his two children,

388
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:19,100
Bobby, age fifteen, and Sally, age nine. All were shot in the head,

389
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:21,800
popping open their skulls and spraying blood and brain matter

390
01:22:21,900 --> 01:22:24,800
all over the living room. A stray bullet went through a window and then

391
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:27,200
through the throat of Suzy Neighbor, age twenty-nine.

392
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:30,800
She collapsed to the sidewalk convulsing, gurgling, spraying blood

393
01:22:30,900 --> 01:22:33,800
as her eight year old daughter watched in terror. Back inside,

394
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:36,800
Anyman performed sexual activities with his daughter's corpse

395
01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:40,300
and cut off the head of his son. The killer then ordered pizza, and devoured

396
01:22:40,350 --> 01:22:44,100
most of a large sausage and Canadian bacon before anyone bothered to arrest him.

397
01:22:44,300 --> 01:22:47,700
Anyman went to court, pleaded stupidity, and was released a free man,

398
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:52,000
but charged with a minimal fine for the mess he made. John Q. Anyman has now

399
01:22:52,020 --> 01:22:55,700
been offered 2.1 million dollars for his story, which will soon be produced

400
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:59,800
as a network television movie. In a related story, new legislation

401
01:22:59,900 --> 01:23:03,100
has been passed to help those criminals who couldn't afford a good lawyer

402
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:06,900
and subsequently couldn't avoid punishment for their various assaults,

403
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:11,200
rapes, murders, and other trivial offenses. This new legislation will give

404
01:23:11,300 --> 01:23:15,500
even more rights to convicted criminals and get them back out onto the streets

405
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:18,300
stalking your teenage daughter in no time.

406
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:10,600
Do what I say, when I say it. We'll meet at the usual spot for the handoff.

407
01:25:11,700 --> 01:25:14,100
I'll give you the goods and the delivery address.

408
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:17,300
If you're a good boy, we'll all make out like bandits.

409
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,600
We'll all make out like bandits.

410
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,300
If you fuck up, they'll kill you.

411
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:24,700
If they don't, I will put a bullet in your head myself.

412
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:29,100
I've got a lot riding on this, Aaron. Watch your step.

413
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:31,700
Watch yourself. Watch your step.

414
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,500
Hey. You supposed to meet somebody here?

415
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:00,900
No. Who are you?

416
01:26:02,300 --> 01:26:03,000
Fuckin' moron.

417
01:26:03,100 --> 01:26:08,800
Wait a minute! Are you...? You're not from in here. You're one of the six.

418
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:10,900
What are you talking about?

419
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:15,200
This isn't real. You aren't where you think you are. You were pulled into this place.

420
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:17,100
I've got an idea: fuck off.

421
01:26:17,150 --> 01:26:21,000
Don't you feel it? Like this is all isolated? Like you just drifted in?

422
01:26:21,050 --> 01:26:24,000
There's nothing before it, nothing after it? Like when you dream.

423
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:27,300
Lady, drifting in and out of reality is like a fuckin' hobby to me.

424
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:31,300
Let's cut all the bullshit. If you're not who I'm supposed to do business with, go away.

425
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:34,400
Do you feel any of the others? You came in with five other people.

426
01:26:34,420 --> 01:26:35,800
Hey, I'm all alone here.

427
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:41,100
Then you're the last one left alive.

428
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:48,100
Who the fuck are you?! What the fuck are you doin' here?!

429
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:50,500
Get out of here! Get the fuck out of here!

430
01:26:53,100 --> 01:26:54,600
Jesus. Do you know who that was?

431
01:26:54,700 --> 01:26:55,300
No idea.

432
01:26:57,500 --> 01:27:00,200
Alright. Listen up, alright? Tonight you're earning your money the hard way.

433
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:03,100
I want you to take this to the address I gave you, alright?-
-You didn't give me an address.

434
01:27:04,100 --> 01:27:06,800
Stop playin' fuckin' games, alright? You got a job to do, so do it!

435
01:27:07,300 --> 01:27:09,300
You know, you're not running from Schubert's men or any of

436
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:12,760
those idiots in Harrison's gang. You've got some real problems here,

437
01:27:12,780 --> 01:27:14,600
so you better get your shit together, huh?

438
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:19,000
And you better do it fast. Because they can be here any minute.

439
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:24,800
Who could be here any minute now?

440
01:27:25,300 --> 01:27:29,200
Aaron! You know, you're going to have to start figuring things out

441
01:27:29,220 --> 01:27:35,700
on your own here, huh? Kill or be killed. Take or lose what's yours.

442
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:40,200
Chase or run like hell. Now do your homework.

443
01:31:37,700 --> 01:31:38,500
You okay?

444
01:31:54,400 --> 01:32:03,300
I steal from your mind, Aaron. The images. The beings. The questions.

445
01:32:04,700 --> 01:32:10,400
The demons you must slay are behind your eyes.

446
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:17,500
The ice that imprisons you now contains the same demons you battled against on Earth.

447
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:25,100
Bullets snapping past your face. Blood draining into gutters.

448
01:32:26,300 --> 01:32:32,900
The sound of bone breaking. The smell of flesh rotting.

449
01:32:34,100 --> 01:32:39,200
Fear. Betrayal. Cold.

450
01:32:40,900 --> 01:32:47,200
Garbage. Needles. Escapes.

451
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:50,600
Returning to the start of the circle.

452
01:32:52,700 --> 01:33:02,400
Dealers fucking you. Police fucking you. Friends fucking you.

453
01:33:03,300 --> 01:33:10,100
Hope. Dreams. Faith. Fucking you.

454
01:33:11,700 --> 01:33:16,600
Now, welcome to the final round.

455
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:22,200
You are strong. Stronger than the other five.

456
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,400
So swim to the surface with me.

457
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:34,000
The clarity. The purity. The final battle.

458
01:33:35,300 --> 01:33:37,900
A battle behind your eyes.

459
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,180
What are you?! How are you doing this?!

460
01:39:56,200 --> 01:39:56,900
Doing what?!

461
01:39:56,930 --> 01:39:57,900
Keeping me out!

462
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:09,900
I was not selected to be here. You can't touch me because you didn't bring me in.-
-You're a weak, pathetic little pest.

463
01:40:11,400 --> 01:40:15,300
You're a mortal human being. You're feeble.

464
01:40:17,500 --> 01:40:20,000
You did not enter the ice on your own.

465
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:24,900
Something sent you here.

466
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:33,300
Your name is Abraham.

467
01:40:36,500 --> 01:40:44,000
Think back. Think. Remember. Your name is Abraham.

468
01:40:44,300 --> 01:40:49,600
You are confused. That is a name of a character I once played.

469
01:40:50,300 --> 01:40:53,800
No, you've got to remember. Please, try.

470
01:40:53,900 --> 01:40:57,300
I can read nothing about you. I cannot get inside.

471
01:40:58,500 --> 01:41:03,500
I don't know where you came from, how you got here, if it was by accident.

472
01:41:04,700 --> 01:41:06,700
I do not even know if you have a name.

473
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:16,300
You're the first to enter this realm without my knowledge.

474
01:41:19,100 --> 01:41:25,200
I should probably just kill you but I'm not sure that would be within the rules.

475
01:41:27,700 --> 01:41:34,000
If you talk to me, answer my questions, make yourself less of a mystery,

476
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:40,400
I can guarantee your safety. As I said, you are a first.

477
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:44,600
At the very least, you offer a break in the repetition.

478
01:41:47,700 --> 01:41:52,800
I find you interesting.

479
01:41:59,400 --> 01:42:02,800
Alison. My name is Alison.

480
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:16,300
You do understand that you are different from any of the other beings in here.

481
01:42:17,400 --> 01:42:22,400
Everyone you've seen, they are my slaves, puppets.

482
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:28,500
They are the souls of everyone who has entered this world and lost their life.

483
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:34,800
Your existence here represents the only other real flesh and blood within this dimension.

484
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:40,500
This world simply better utilizes a plan created by your God in Heaven.

485
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:48,450
Reincarnation. When a player dies, they are reincarnated, appearing

486
01:42:48,460 --> 01:42:52,600
as whatever I choose, depending on the next player who will confront them.

487
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:58,900
Have you ever thought of what kind of person you will be reincarnated as?

488
01:43:00,100 --> 01:43:03,900
I don't believe in reincarnation.

489
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:08,600
Do you understand how you came to be here?-
-No, I don't.

490
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,600
Was it your decision to leave your world?

491
01:43:12,300 --> 01:43:15,200
Yes. I guess it was.

492
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:20,600
An escape. And you've landed in paradise.

493
01:43:22,200 --> 01:43:25,300
Are you here because you desire to join me?

494
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:37,900
I invite you, Alison, to share this all with me. You and I, ruling as one.

495
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:42,900
I'm more powerful than anything you've ever encountered.

496
01:43:43,100 --> 01:43:51,300
I have a world at my feet. You, Alison, could taste what I taste.

497
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:57,600
I've been what you've been. So I know. It tastes sour.

498
01:43:58,100 --> 01:44:02,200
You are a worthless animal! You are the defecation of a stupid god!

499
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:07,400
You don't have the intelligence to realize you have never been, and never will be as powerful as-

500
01:44:07,410 --> 01:44:10,400
You're not powerful! You're weak! You're pathetic!

501
01:44:10,420 --> 01:44:13,100
The wizard was a failure and you followed his lead!

502
01:44:13,110 --> 01:44:15,900
You couldn't make it in the real world, so you traded it in for this one!

503
01:44:15,910 --> 01:44:17,600
That's not the way it really was!

504
01:44:18,100 --> 01:44:24,700
You are worthless, inferior! Someone has been filling your head with these stories.

505
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:29,500
I want you to name the source of this blasphemy. They tell you these things because they are jealous.

506
01:44:29,650 --> 01:44:33,200
They want me out because I have more power than they could ever possess.

507
01:44:33,400 --> 01:44:36,400
That's why they lied to you, Alison. That's why they sent you in here.

508
01:44:36,600 --> 01:44:38,000
Now tell me where you came from!

509
01:44:38,001 --> 01:44:41,200
I came from the same place as you! We lived in the same air.

510
01:44:41,220 --> 01:44:44,380
We drank the same water. We both had the same idea we'd never succeed,

511
01:44:44,500 --> 01:44:48,300
never reach our goals. I thought I knew everything. I thought I knew my future

512
01:44:48,350 --> 01:44:50,700
and I thought I'd get nothing but shit for the rest of my life.

513
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:54,600
But I don't know my future. Not like you, here in this place.

514
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:57,700
You know exactly how things are going to happen because you control it!

515
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,700
And self-serving control is for cowards!-
-Control is for leaders.

516
01:45:00,710 --> 01:45:01,700
What are you leading?!

517
01:45:01,710 --> 01:45:04,200
You know nothing about leadership!-
-I know what you think leadership is!

518
01:45:04,210 --> 01:45:06,500
It's not about power! It's dealing with what's thrown at you,

519
01:45:06,510 --> 01:45:09,800
dealing with the unknown!-
-You were unable to battle the unknown! You escaped!

520
01:45:09,900 --> 01:45:13,400
We escaped! Both of us! But I didn't steal another life!

521
01:45:13,500 --> 01:45:16,600
You escaped with the promise of reward! I fucking locked myself away,

522
01:45:16,700 --> 01:45:19,300
took a knife in my hands and cut open my wrists!

523
01:45:27,400 --> 01:45:32,300
Both of us were weak. Both of us thought we knew our future.

524
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:36,430
Both of us didn't think we could change our future. But now I'm here

525
01:45:36,450 --> 01:45:41,400
looking at you. A coward who took the life of a woman who loved you, trusted you.

526
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:45,100
And I know my mistakes are minor compared to your cowardly actions.

527
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:49,000
You...

528
01:45:49,300 --> 01:45:52,500
Could you have taken your own life?! Could you do what I did?!

529
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:55,400
No. You're too selfish, even for that!

530
01:45:56,000 --> 01:46:01,100
You're too weak to do what I did. Cutting my own wrists! Spilling my own blood!

531
01:46:01,110 --> 01:46:03,600
My own blood, you fucking coward!

532
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:45,500
You... You...

533
01:46:49,300 --> 01:46:53,800
I own this world. I own these powers.

534
01:46:55,100 --> 01:46:59,900
And now I own the woman who I had to give up to gain everything else.

535
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:08,100
And you don't believe in reincarnation.

536
01:47:20,300 --> 01:47:23,500
No!!! No!!!

537
01:48:29,500 --> 01:48:36,300
Alison. Listen to me. Close your eyes.

538
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:43,600
You have performed well, Alison. And you are to be rewarded.

539
01:48:45,100 --> 01:48:52,100
We are giving you a choice. You may now continue and enter your next phase.

540
01:48:53,300 --> 01:48:58,300
You may do so without the standard punishments you would otherwise

541
01:48:58,350 --> 01:49:01,300
have to endure for committing suicide.

542
01:49:02,100 --> 01:49:08,300
Or you may return to your world for a second chance at your life.

543
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:17,400
The decision is yours, Alison. You may take a few moments to evaluate your options.
