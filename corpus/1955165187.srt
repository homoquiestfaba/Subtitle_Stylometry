Yh? again and again ...

71
00:09:48,408 --> 00:09:53,355
Jesus proved to us to be
more compared to the good? teacher.

72
00:09:53,355 --> 00:09:58,600
Size el? M? In my time, Ama has spoken
Jesus Christ's teachings

73
00:09:58,996 --> 00:10:03,874
And the whole ik? Ni is?
and min? silently v? ltelimme h? nt ?.

74
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:09,059
Certainly the? In? these days ?, when Darwinism
and scientific research

75
00:10:09,059 --> 00:10:11,754
things like that EIV? t can not be true.

76
00:10:11,754 --> 00:10:15,436
And yet, when the minister speaking

77
00:10:15,436 --> 00:10:22,160
and when you read the Bible, I had never felt
was so h? mmentynyt cardiovascular mess? ni.

80
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:30,619
I had never heard such words.

81
00:10:32,154 --> 00:10:34,541
And I had never heard the words
the kind of power.

82
00:10:35,582 --> 00:10:37,876
"Min? I have come,
that? teill? would have el? m? ...

84
00:10:41,345 --> 00:10:48,988
Can t? M? be the explanation for the purpose,
what? I janonnut so long?

85
00:10:49,318 --> 00:10:52,667
Either she's a liar
and the truth is not h? ness? ...

86
00:10:52,667 --> 00:10:57,418
He's had it what? said;
that is, the Son of God.

87
00:10:57,418 --> 00:11:03,104
Unfortunately, all meeting
did not have the same kind of? k ??.

88
00:11:12,928 --> 00:11:16,423
Then there was the father's dreams.

94
00:12:27,104 --> 00:12:31,061
For many p? Ivien time I
talked to the preacher.

95
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,762

100
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:55,960
Because how else we could be controlled,
if only base our our faith?

101
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:59,129
Often, the? M? Questions are
difficult and carefully targeted.

102
00:12:59,129 --> 00:13:03,054
Sometimes it feels like that? I t? TOB?
