1
00:00:50,433 --> 00:00:53,471
Man oh man,
look at those waves, Luke

2
00:00:53,503 --> 00:00:54,847
I'm thinkin' today's the day.

3
00:00:54,938 --> 00:00:56,144
Today's the day for what?

4
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,480
You know what
I'm talkin' about.

5
00:00:57,508 --> 00:00:59,146
You're gonna get in
the water today, Case?

6
00:00:59,176 --> 00:01:00,211
Oh, I'm gonna get in the water.

7
00:01:00,244 --> 00:01:00,984
Today?

8
00:01:01,011 --> 00:01:01,311
Today!

9
00:01:01,345 --> 00:01:03,256
I'm gonna get up on
that board today.

10
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,987
You're telling me you're
gonna get in the water

11
00:01:05,015 --> 00:01:06,182
after all this time?

12
00:01:06,183 --> 00:01:09,252
It's been since junior high
you haven't done it yet.

13
00:01:09,253 --> 00:01:10,460
You're right,
I haven't done it yet,

14
00:01:10,789 --> 00:01:11,927
but I'm gonna do it today.

15
00:01:12,023 --> 00:01:13,357
What's so special
about today then?

16
00:01:13,358 --> 00:01:15,360
You wanna know what's
special about today?

17
00:01:15,427 --> 00:01:17,304
I had my Crunch-berries
this morning,

18
00:01:17,328 --> 00:01:19,205
so I'm feelin' good.

19
00:02:04,812 --> 00:02:07,850
Waves were awesome
this morning, bro.

20
00:02:07,882 --> 00:02:09,987
Dude, you are insane.

21
00:02:10,551 --> 00:02:12,930
What do I have to do
to get you in the water?

22
00:02:13,021 --> 00:02:15,228
Uh, drain the ocean.

23
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,528
Right, right.

24
00:02:16,658 --> 00:02:17,864
I'm serious.

25
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,571
I can't believe we're
almost done with school.

26
00:02:20,596 --> 00:02:21,233
Done?

27
00:02:21,497 --> 00:02:25,536
Uh, hello, we still have like
another four more years to go.

28
00:02:26,135 --> 00:02:27,376
What, college?

29
00:02:27,604 --> 00:02:28,582
College.

30
00:02:29,572 --> 00:02:32,246
Dude, I don't even want
to think about college.

31
00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:34,313
I just want to surf.

32
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:38,081
Oh man.

33
00:02:38,348 --> 00:02:40,760
That's all I ever think about.

34
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,588
I gotta figure out away
to get sponsored.

35
00:02:43,754 --> 00:02:45,256
You'll do it, man.

36
00:02:45,422 --> 00:02:48,130
You're like the best
surfer I know.

37
00:02:48,526 --> 00:02:51,939
Case, I'm the only
surfer you know.

38
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,376
Gonna be so late to math class.

39
00:02:55,533 --> 00:02:57,368
Ready for that test, man?

40
00:02:57,369 --> 00:02:59,280
Um, we'll see.

41
00:03:20,426 --> 00:03:21,404
Hey honey.

42
00:03:21,494 --> 00:03:22,234
Hey.

43
00:03:23,296 --> 00:03:24,331
How's the case going?

44
00:03:24,363 --> 00:03:24,663
It's goin...

45
00:03:24,664 --> 00:03:26,665
Oh hey, don't forget about
dinner tonight with Luke.

46
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:28,772
It's time to pin him down
on that college thing.

47
00:03:28,802 --> 00:03:29,803
Right.

48
00:03:30,137 --> 00:03:31,309
Love you.

49
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,114
Love you, too.

50
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:53,364
Oh, dude, I totally bombed
that math test, man.

51
00:03:53,595 --> 00:03:55,802
Man, maybe you should
skip college.

52
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:58,333
That was like, the easiest
math test we've had all year.

53
00:03:58,366 --> 00:03:59,437
Yeah right.

54
00:03:59,668 --> 00:04:01,341
Come on, man, adding's easy.

55
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,646
It's the square roots
you gotta worry about.

56
00:04:03,906 --> 00:04:04,782
Whatever.

57
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,342
Yo dude, there she is.

58
00:04:06,575 --> 00:04:08,776
Oh, come on, look,
she dissed the quarterback

59
00:04:08,777 --> 00:04:10,620
of the football team, okay?

60
00:04:10,679 --> 00:04:12,488
She's not gonna want
to date a surf bum.

61
00:04:12,648 --> 00:04:13,715
Hey, who's that guy?

62
00:04:13,716 --> 00:04:16,357
Oh yeah, it's the new
kid in school.

63
00:04:16,453 --> 00:04:18,490
I hear that he
murders the waves.

64
00:04:18,655 --> 00:04:19,655
What are you talking about?

65
00:04:19,656 --> 00:04:20,657
I've never seen him before.

66
00:04:20,724 --> 00:04:22,635
I bet you she totally
shuts him down.

67
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:23,999
Let's see.

68
00:04:24,528 --> 00:04:25,632
Dude, check it.

69
00:04:26,596 --> 00:04:28,837
Treated, man.

70
00:04:29,901 --> 00:04:32,302
Oh man, he saw us, he saw us.

71
00:04:32,303 --> 00:04:35,512
Dude, that was hilarious.

72
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,751
See? Told you, dude.

73
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:40,744
She doesn't date football players,
there's no way she's gonna

74
00:04:40,745 --> 00:04:42,349
date a surfer.

75
00:04:42,413 --> 00:04:43,551
We'll see.

76
00:04:44,048 --> 00:04:46,495
Oh, we surf in' after school?

77
00:04:46,885 --> 00:04:47,625
No, man.

78
00:04:47,653 --> 00:04:49,353
I'm bummed, I gotta work.

79
00:04:49,354 --> 00:04:50,731
Cool, cool.

80
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:54,432
Well, ah, can I hang out
after school?

81
00:04:54,459 --> 00:04:56,594
I mean, my...
my mom's new boyfriend

82
00:04:56,595 --> 00:04:59,599
doesn't exactly like me
hanging around.. weird.

83
00:04:59,631 --> 00:05:01,077
What are you
talkin' about. Case?

84
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:02,000
It's your house,

85
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:02,809
Yeah, yeah,

86
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:06,578
Try telling him that.

87
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:09,775
Hey, dude, of course, man.

88
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:13,383
Dude, um, how about
after fifth period?

89
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:14,379
Yeah, totally man.

90
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:14,813
Is that cool?

91
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,649
Yeah. Is that the bell?

92
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,750
I got history.

93
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:19,424
Alright, man.

94
00:05:19,453 --> 00:05:20,397
Stay up, stay up, man.

95
00:05:20,421 --> 00:05:21,593
For sho.

96
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:32,435
Yo, Lukester, you should let me
take this one out sometime, bro.

97
00:05:32,467 --> 00:05:35,369
First, it would never ﬂoat you.

98
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:38,681
And, Case, you don't
know how to surf.

99
00:05:38,707 --> 00:05:41,742
Well, you've been promising
to teach me since like...

100
00:05:41,743 --> 00:05:42,744
junior high.

101
00:05:42,777 --> 00:05:47,420
Case, you gotta get out
into the water first, man.

102
00:05:49,852 --> 00:05:52,954
Dude, there's sharks
out there and stuff.

103
00:05:52,955 --> 00:05:55,902
Okay, you know, stuff
that could like, kill you.

104
00:05:55,925 --> 00:05:58,098
Right, like, let's say
we're swimming along

105
00:05:58,127 --> 00:06:00,869
like, somewhere exotic,
like in the Caribbeans,

106
00:06:00,896 --> 00:06:03,065
and then I cut my leg
on a coral reef.

107
00:06:03,066 --> 00:06:05,979
Sharks have a very strong
sense of smell,

108
00:06:06,003 --> 00:06:07,069
and then the next thing
you know,

109
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,438
one of them comes up,
rips my leg off.

110
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:12,241
Case, I think you've watched
Jaws one too many times, man.

111
00:06:12,242 --> 00:06:15,018
It's a great movie,
great movie.

112
00:06:15,045 --> 00:06:16,854
Hey, what time is it?

113
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,019
It's like almost four.

114
00:06:18,049 --> 00:06:20,495
Oh man, I'm late for work, again.

115
00:06:20,551 --> 00:06:23,887
Which reminds me, huh? Huh?

116
00:06:23,888 --> 00:06:24,788
I got you man.

117
00:06:24,789 --> 00:06:26,962
Extra cheese, sausage.

118
00:06:27,425 --> 00:06:28,825
Hey Luke, my board ready?

119
00:06:28,826 --> 00:06:31,695
Um, Kyle, bro, uhh,
I'm late for work.

120
00:06:31,696 --> 00:06:33,677
C'mon, you promised
it'd be ready today.

121
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:36,805
I know dude, I'm sorry, I am,
but ahh tomorrow, okay?

122
00:06:36,835 --> 00:06:38,109
C'mon, man, you promised.

123
00:06:38,137 --> 00:06:40,004
You're really gonna put
a guilt trip on me, huh?

124
00:06:40,005 --> 00:06:41,906
Yeah, I am.

125
00:06:41,907 --> 00:06:43,147
Alright, one second.

126
00:06:52,318 --> 00:06:54,953
This isn't it, is it?

127
00:06:54,954 --> 00:06:56,194
Whoa.

128
00:06:56,289 --> 00:06:58,557
Huh, you like?

129
00:06:58,558 --> 00:07:00,526
Oh, yeah, it looks perfect.

130
00:07:00,527 --> 00:07:01,460
How much?

131
00:07:01,461 --> 00:07:02,628
Gratis, buddy.

132
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:03,540
Huh?

133
00:07:03,564 --> 00:07:04,770
Uh, just let me get
a wave some time

134
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:05,834
you little wave hog.

135
00:07:05,866 --> 00:07:06,867
'Kay.

136
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:12,806
Wow.

137
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,808
Should let me take
this one out sometime, bro.

138
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:17,911
Yeah man, I don't think so.

139
00:07:17,912 --> 00:07:20,917
Cool dude, right on.

140
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:22,850
I'll cat... yeah,

141
00:07:22,851 --> 00:07:23,761

Catch ya later, man.

143
00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:37,543

The Besta-Wan Pizza House.

145
00:08:01,592 --> 00:08:05,040
Well, well, well, look
what the cat dragged in.

146
00:08:05,063 --> 00:08:07,543
Will you ever be on time, Harris?

147
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,666
I know, I'm sorry.

148
00:08:09,667 --> 00:08:11,568
Well, we got
deliveries piling up.

149
00:08:11,569 --> 00:08:12,946

You remember when pizzas

160
00:08:59,387 --> 00:09:02,834
Yeah, I think that was
before I was born.

161
00:09:03,357 --> 00:09:05,166
What are all the pizzas
for anyway?

162
00:09:05,259 --> 00:09:06,527

00:09:06,528 --> 00:09:08,508

Dude, is that a Patterson?

173
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:27,950
Yep.

174
00:09:27,951 --> 00:09:29,718
Pretty sweet, huh?

175
00:09:29,719 --> 00:09:33,098
Are you kidding me,
it's insane!

176
00:09:33,623 --> 00:09:36,658
Oh, so is the price though.

You remember when boards

00:09:39,864 --> 00:09:41,036
Two-hundred bucks?

179
00:09:41,265 --> 00:09:44,100
Yeah, I think that was before
I was born, little bro.

We can do a lay-a-way for you.

181
00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:48,216
Uh maybe,
I get paid tomorrow, so...

182
00:09:48,239 --> 00:09:51,083
I would not let this thing
sit around too long, Lukey.

183
00:09:51,108 --> 00:09:53,277
I got so many guys eyeing it.

184
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:55,417
It's got magic board
written all over it.

185
00:09:55,447 --> 00:09:57,688
Yeah, it does.

186
00:09:57,716 --> 00:09:59,450
Oh man.

187
00:09:59,451 --> 00:10:00,589
Alright hey, I gotta
get back to work, so...

188
00:10:00,619 --> 00:10:01,427
Okay.

189
00:10:01,453 --> 00:10:02,523
Alright.

190
00:10:02,787 --> 00:10:04,164
Don't forget the try outs.

191
00:10:04,222 --> 00:10:05,098
I won't.

192
00:10:19,572 --> 00:10:22,781
Saltwater rotting your brain Luke?

193
00:10:23,309 --> 00:10:25,017
What's in the bag?

194
00:10:28,515 --> 00:10:33,521
You've got six minutes to get Mrs. Winterbottom
her large jalepeno and meatball

195
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,390
or it's coming out of your salary!

196
00:10:52,106 --> 00:10:55,418
Hey Mom.

197
00:10:55,444 --> 00:10:57,879
Where's Dad?

198
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,860
You're late, Luke.

199
00:10:59,882 --> 00:11:02,083
I asked you to be
on time tonight, honey.

200
00:11:02,084 --> 00:11:03,718
Well, where's Dad?

201
00:11:03,719 --> 00:11:06,427
He's later than I am.

202
00:11:06,522 --> 00:11:08,523
This isn't about your father,

203
00:11:08,524 --> 00:11:11,360
this is about you
showing a little respect.

204
00:11:11,361 --> 00:11:14,638
Alright, take it easy,
I'm sorry.

205
00:11:14,664 --> 00:11:16,507
Sorry about what?

206
00:11:16,533 --> 00:11:19,201
Nothin'.

207
00:11:19,202 --> 00:11:20,306
I'm starved.

208
00:11:20,337 --> 00:11:26,050
Well, now that we're all here,
we can say grace first?

209
00:11:26,077 --> 00:11:27,181
Sure.

210
00:11:30,214 --> 00:11:34,284
Dear Lord, thank you
for this food.

211
00:11:34,285 --> 00:11:36,356
Thank you for the time
that we can spend

212
00:11:36,387 --> 00:11:38,367
together as a family.

213
00:11:38,923 --> 00:11:41,837
And please, Bless the time
that we have together

214
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,806
this evening.

215
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:46,030
In Jesus' name, amen.

216
00:11:46,031 --> 00:11:47,704
Amen.

217
00:11:49,568 --> 00:11:51,514
Oh, amen.

218
00:11:51,536 --> 00:11:55,005
Well, I hope it's not cold

219
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:57,175
it was hot at seven
when everybody was

220
00:11:57,176 --> 00:12:01,146
supposed to be here.

221
00:12:01,147 --> 00:12:02,217
How's work?

222
00:12:02,248 --> 00:12:03,420
Work's work.

223
00:12:06,953 --> 00:12:09,421
So, any word on colleges yet?

224
00:12:09,422 --> 00:12:14,372
Yeah, deadlines are
comin' up, Luke.

225
00:12:14,395 --> 00:12:17,103
What if I didn't want
to go to college?

226
00:12:17,765 --> 00:12:20,867
What?

227
00:12:20,868 --> 00:12:22,802
You hear this kid?

228
00:12:22,803 --> 00:12:24,009
Did I miss the memo
that you had a choice

229
00:12:24,038 --> 00:12:24,982
in the matter?

230
00:12:25,005 --> 00:12:27,748
Look, what if I just
want to surf for a living?

231
00:12:27,776 --> 00:12:31,311
I'm sorry, is somebody
paying you to surf?

232
00:12:31,312 --> 00:12:32,655
Yeah, exactly.

233
00:12:32,681 --> 00:12:35,315
So surf on your own time,
because your mother and I

234
00:12:35,316 --> 00:12:37,489
have been sacrificing
for years so that you can get

235
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,295
a good education.

236
00:12:40,321 --> 00:12:42,457
Thanks.

237
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,597
Look Luke, we've been
putting up with this

238
00:12:44,627 --> 00:12:47,506
surfing thing for years.

239
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:52,275
I mean, you've turned
my garage into a surf shop.

240
00:12:52,301 --> 00:12:53,609
It's time you grow up.

241
00:12:53,903 --> 00:12:56,907
You're gonna go to college,
and that's it.

242
00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:03,623
I just, uh...
love these family dinners.

243
00:13:03,647 --> 00:13:04,682
And you know what?

244
00:13:04,715 --> 00:13:05,659
You don't have to eat anything.

245
00:13:05,682 --> 00:13:06,888
Why don't you just go
up to your room then.

246
00:13:06,917 --> 00:13:07,918
Fine, I will.

247
00:13:07,951 --> 00:13:08,895
David!

248
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:09,659
What?

249
00:13:09,686 --> 00:13:11,688
You know, and I appreciate
the support, Dad.

250
00:13:11,721 --> 00:13:12,894
Yeah, but how about
the roof over your head?

251
00:13:12,924 --> 00:13:15,666
And the food on the table, pal?

252
00:13:15,693 --> 00:13:16,933
Really?

253
00:13:23,701 --> 00:13:25,703
You're unbelievable.

254
00:13:35,013 --> 00:13:36,959
Where are you going?

255
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:39,723
Surveillance all night.

256
00:13:39,751 --> 00:13:40,923
Don't wait up.

257
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:49,836
Perfect.

258
00:13:50,063 --> 00:13:52,976
This is just perfect.

259
00:13:58,772 --> 00:14:01,719
Encinitas.

260
00:15:39,613 --> 00:15:41,684
Hey, what're are you doing here?

261
00:15:41,715 --> 00:15:43,888
You're usually the last
one in, first one out.

262
00:15:44,217 --> 00:15:46,254
Yeah, well...

263
00:15:46,286 --> 00:15:48,289
not in a huge hurry
to get home.

264
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:52,792
Uh-oh, girlfriend or parents?

265
00:15:52,793 --> 00:15:56,930
Parents... they're trying
to plan my life for me.

266
00:15:56,931 --> 00:15:59,032
You gotta have a plan, Luke.

267
00:15:59,033 --> 00:16:03,004
Life can get pretty messy
without a plan.

268
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:06,680
Yeah, but I mean,
their plan or mine?

269
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,843
Well, you have to
honor your parents,

270
00:16:08,844 --> 00:16:11,017
that's a command of God,

271
00:16:11,213 --> 00:16:15,216
But you also have to maximize
the gift that God's given you.

272
00:16:15,217 --> 00:16:17,853
They want me to go
to college and...

273
00:16:17,854 --> 00:16:19,265
I just want to surf.

274
00:16:19,288 --> 00:16:21,325
You gotta get you education.

275
00:16:21,624 --> 00:16:23,934
That's just a fact of life.

276
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,064
Especially when you've
got parents that are

277
00:16:25,094 --> 00:16:28,769
willing to pay for it.

278
00:16:28,798 --> 00:16:30,732
Your parents make
you go to college?

279
00:16:30,733 --> 00:16:32,110
Did they make me go?

280
00:16:32,636 --> 00:16:34,638
Don't I wish.

281
00:16:34,672 --> 00:16:37,653
No, I did everything
the hard way.

282
00:16:37,675 --> 00:16:40,643
Twenty years in the army,
taking classes on the side,

283
00:16:40,644 --> 00:16:42,954
saving every penny I could.

284
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:45,748
But see, that was my plan.

285
00:16:45,749 --> 00:16:48,060
And here I am.

286
00:16:48,086 --> 00:16:52,089
Gonna be opening a second
location soon, too.

287
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,899
That's great, Carl.

288
00:16:53,925 --> 00:16:56,894
Look, all you have to do
is come up with a plan

289
00:16:56,895 --> 00:16:59,000
that will please you,
your parents,

290
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:01,636
but most importantly God.

291
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:02,041
Is that all?

292
00:17:02,067 --> 00:17:03,741
That's all.

293
00:17:03,769 --> 00:17:05,749
Ha ha ha.

294
00:17:05,771 --> 00:17:09,742
Look, why don't you
talk to your folks.

295
00:17:09,775 --> 00:17:11,810
You might be surprised
how receptive they can be

296
00:17:11,811 --> 00:17:15,647
when they see that you're
taking some action.

297
00:17:15,648 --> 00:17:17,816
Do you do much night surfing?

298
00:17:17,817 --> 00:17:19,852
Night surfing?

299
00:17:19,853 --> 00:17:21,833
It's kinda hard
to see the waves, Carl.

300
00:17:21,855 --> 00:17:25,701
Well, you can always
take night classes.

301
00:17:25,726 --> 00:17:29,929
Same credit, same degree.

302
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:33,002
Now, get on outta here,
I gotta lock up.

303
00:17:36,471 --> 00:17:38,038
Thanks.

304
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:39,382
Thanks, Carl.

305
00:17:46,214 --> 00:17:48,251
Lou's Records.

306
00:17:48,282 --> 00:17:51,986
Oh, I was hangin' with Nat
down at the shop today,

307
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:54,222
he was telling me how
there was an opening

308
00:17:54,223 --> 00:17:57,432
on the surf team and how
tryouts were coming up...

309
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,200
I mean, I'm sure you
heard about it.

310
00:17:59,228 --> 00:18:00,228
Yeah.

311
00:18:00,229 --> 00:18:02,130
Yeah, I heard about it.

312
00:18:02,131 --> 00:18:07,013
Well, you're gonna tryout, right?

313
00:18:07,037 --> 00:18:08,303
I don't know.

314
00:18:08,304 --> 00:18:10,181
What do you mean
you don't know, man?

315
00:18:10,206 --> 00:18:12,311
I mean, think about it
this is your shot.

316
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:15,414
You make the team,
and you're on your way.

317
00:18:15,445 --> 00:18:17,146
Maybe.

318
00:18:17,147 --> 00:18:18,455
Maybe...

319
00:18:18,982 --> 00:18:23,386
Well, I took the liberty
of signing us both up.

320
00:18:23,387 --> 00:18:24,422
You did what?

321
00:18:24,989 --> 00:18:26,322
I had to, man.

322
00:18:26,323 --> 00:18:28,360
What do you mean
you had to, Case?

323
00:18:28,392 --> 00:18:31,127
Well that new guy from school
was in the shop today

324
00:18:31,128 --> 00:18:32,228
and he was talking to Nat.

325
00:18:32,229 --> 00:18:35,267
He was all like,
"Oh, that spot is so mine."

326
00:18:35,299 --> 00:18:38,269
And I was like, “Psh,
that's funny coming from

327
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:41,005
"a guy who doesn't know
how to pop up."

328
00:18:41,006 --> 00:18:43,274
So I signed us up.

329
00:18:43,275 --> 00:18:45,242
I'm just looking out
for you, bro.

330
00:18:45,243 --> 00:18:50,243
Besides, that spot, all you.

331
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,991
Yeah, yeah.

332
00:18:57,090 --> 00:19:00,071
Ah, here we go, jackpot.

333
00:19:00,092 --> 00:19:01,093
Nice.

334
00:19:01,094 --> 00:19:03,131
See, I told you
Lou's Records would have it.

335
00:19:03,162 --> 00:19:04,266
You see this price?

336
00:19:04,297 --> 00:19:06,004
Pretty nice.

337
00:19:23,251 --> 00:19:25,356
What's this?

338
00:19:25,887 --> 00:19:29,757
So, I have a plan.

339
00:19:29,758 --> 00:19:33,865
There's tryouts coming up
for the local surf team.

340
00:19:33,895 --> 00:19:37,708
I'm signed up, and I think
I really have a shot.

341
00:19:37,733 --> 00:19:39,167
Luke, we've talked
about this surfing thing.

342
00:19:39,168 --> 00:19:43,480
Honey, your son has a plan,
I think we should let him finish.

343
00:19:46,442 --> 00:19:49,150
Okay, so here's the deal.

344
00:19:49,178 --> 00:19:53,491
If I make the surf team,
I get to keep surfing full time.

345
00:19:53,917 --> 00:19:57,592
But I promise I will
go to night classes

346
00:19:57,621 --> 00:19:58,759
at the community college.

347
00:19:58,788 --> 00:20:01,701
And if you don't make it?

348
00:20:01,725 --> 00:20:06,572
I mean if, if I don't make it,
then I mean...

349
00:20:06,596 --> 00:20:08,798
you can pick any college
you want me to go to

350
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:12,804
even if it's a thousand miles
away from the nearest beach.

351
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:16,944
But I'm still gonna get
my education either way.

352
00:20:16,974 --> 00:20:20,977
So... you really can't lose.

353
00:20:20,978 --> 00:20:23,585
I mean, what good
is making this surf team?

354
00:20:23,615 --> 00:20:24,849
Are they gonna pay your rent?

355
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:26,851
It's just a step, Dad.

356
00:20:26,852 --> 00:20:30,288
Well, I think it's
a great plan, Lucas.

357
00:20:30,289 --> 00:20:32,269
I do, and I'm really
proud of you for coming

358
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,396
to talk to us about it.

359
00:20:34,426 --> 00:20:36,527
Dad?

360
00:20:36,528 --> 00:20:40,375
Win or lose, no more surf shop.

361
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,674
I want my garage back.

362
00:20:42,035 --> 00:20:44,015
Deal, deal.

363
00:20:44,037 --> 00:20:44,903
Okay?

364
00:20:44,904 --> 00:20:45,712
Okay.

365
00:20:45,738 --> 00:20:47,843
We're gonna go with you
on this one, alright?

366
00:20:47,874 --> 00:20:48,907
It's up to you now.

367
00:20:48,908 --> 00:20:50,979
Thanks, Dad.

368
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:52,614
Mom.

369
00:21:01,755 --> 00:21:02,893
I really have
no life right now.

370
00:21:02,923 --> 00:21:04,524
I can't even...

371
00:21:04,525 --> 00:21:06,869
Hello.

372
00:21:06,894 --> 00:21:08,628
Hi, uh, can I help you?

373
00:21:08,629 --> 00:21:11,565
Yeah, we have
a pizza for pick-up.

374
00:21:11,566 --> 00:21:13,637
Wait, aren't you
in my history class?

375
00:21:13,668 --> 00:21:14,738
Yeah, yeah.

376
00:21:14,769 --> 00:21:15,713
You sit in the front, right?

377
00:21:15,737 --> 00:21:17,512
Yeah, ye ah, that's me.

378
00:21:17,539 --> 00:21:21,919
I'm Emily, by the way.

379
00:21:22,577 --> 00:21:23,988
Luke.

380
00:21:24,012 --> 00:21:25,617
The pizza?

381
00:21:25,648 --> 00:21:28,686
And this is Jessica.

382
00:21:28,718 --> 00:21:30,823
Yeah, um, what's the last name?

383
00:21:30,853 --> 00:21:32,662
Lopez.

384
00:21:32,688 --> 00:21:34,895
Right.

385
00:21:34,924 --> 00:21:36,665
That was so obvious.

386
00:21:36,692 --> 00:21:40,028
He's so cute.

387
00:21:40,029 --> 00:21:42,031
Large pepperoni,
extra cheese, right?

388
00:21:42,032 --> 00:21:46,606
Yeah, that's it.

389
00:21:46,637 --> 00:21:48,742
Hello, the total?

390
00:21:48,772 --> 00:21:50,843
Oh, uh...

391
00:21:50,874 --> 00:21:54,686
$14.50.

392
00:21:54,711 --> 00:21:55,952
Thanks.

393
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:00,388
Here you go.

394
00:22:00,418 --> 00:22:00,691
Thanks.

395
00:22:00,718 --> 00:22:02,519
Thank you.

396
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,467
Are you guys going
to Kelsey's party tonight?

397
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:07,791
We, um, heard about it.

398
00:22:07,792 --> 00:22:08,793
Are you going?

399
00:22:08,826 --> 00:22:10,864
Yeah, I mean I'll be there.

400
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:11,996
Cool.

401
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,766
Well, it was nice
to finally meet you, Luke.

402
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:16,906
Likewise.

403
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:19,711
Oh, you too Jess... Jessica.

404
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:23,474
Yeah. Bye.

405
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:25,614
That part of the plan, Luke?

406
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:30,560
We'll see, Carl.

407
00:22:56,677 --> 00:22:58,479
Bro.

408
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,649
This party is sick.

409
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:03,630
There's babes...

410
00:23:03,652 --> 00:23:06,554
everywhere I turn.

411
00:23:06,555 --> 00:23:06,921
Yeah, man, well...

412
00:23:06,922 --> 00:23:09,869
why don't you go
introduce yourself?

413
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:12,159
That's the problem, man.

414
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:17,161
Everywhere I turn,
they turn me down.

415
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,835
Case, I'm sure

416
00:23:18,868 --> 00:23:22,782
there's somebody
out there for you, man.

417
00:23:26,476 --> 00:23:29,078
Dude, no way.

418
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:30,213
Yo, I'll be back.

419
00:23:30,214 --> 00:23:31,056
What?

420
00:23:31,081 --> 00:23:33,891
Oh, come on,
you're not gonna...

421
00:23:33,917 --> 00:23:38,917
You're gonna
crash and bum, bro.

422
00:23:39,523 --> 00:23:39,998
He looks drunk.

423
00:23:40,257 --> 00:23:42,134
I know.

424
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:43,092
Oh, hey girls.

425
00:23:43,093 --> 00:23:45,040
Hey, what's up?

426
00:23:45,063 --> 00:23:46,098
Having fun?

427
00:23:46,131 --> 00:23:48,008
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

428
00:23:48,032 --> 00:23:50,239
Oh, oh, can I get you
a beer or something?

429
00:23:50,502 --> 00:23:52,402
No, um, actually we're good.

430
00:23:52,403 --> 00:23:54,772
So is this what you call
a birthday party?

431
00:23:54,773 --> 00:23:55,773
Yeah.

432
00:23:55,774 --> 00:23:57,185
Yeah, I mean...

433
00:23:57,475 --> 00:24:00,445
there's someone
with a hat on over there.

434
00:24:00,446 --> 00:24:02,881
I can't remember who, but yeah.

435
00:24:02,882 --> 00:24:03,986
So, um, is this

436
00:24:04,016 --> 00:24:06,151
what you usually do for fun?

437
00:24:06,152 --> 00:24:07,952
No, I...

438
00:24:07,953 --> 00:24:09,899
usually I'm in the water.

439
00:24:09,922 --> 00:24:13,062
Oh, are you on the swim team?

440
00:24:13,392 --> 00:24:15,134
No, the swim team?

441
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,368
No. no.

442
00:24:16,396 --> 00:24:18,069
Usually I'm surfing.

443
00:24:18,098 --> 00:24:20,166
Oh, you surf,
that's, that's so cool

444
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:22,501
I've, I've always wanted
to surf, actually.

445
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:23,378
No way, really?

446
00:24:23,403 --> 00:24:24,136
Yeah.

447
00:24:24,137 --> 00:24:25,309
I could totally
teach you sometime.

448
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:27,006
I, I go before school.

449
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,213
Yes, that would be amazing.

450
00:24:28,241 --> 00:24:29,876
Okay, surfer girl?

451
00:24:29,877 --> 00:24:31,049
We have that other
get-together to go to,

452
00:24:31,078 --> 00:24:32,148
and we're late.

453
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,022
Sorry.

454
00:24:33,047 --> 00:24:34,890
Um, yeah, we, I have to go.

455
00:24:34,916 --> 00:24:36,953
But it was really
good to see you.

456
00:24:36,984 --> 00:24:38,051
I'll talk to you later.

457
00:24:38,052 --> 00:24:38,894
Likewise.

458
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,990
Okay, bye.

459
00:24:40,021 --> 00:24:41,193
Alright.

460
00:24:41,222 --> 00:24:43,930
And don't drink too much.

461
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:45,029
No, I won't, I won't.

462
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,836
Hey, great convo.

463
00:24:50,833 --> 00:24:52,835
Convo.

464
00:24:52,868 --> 00:24:55,109
Smooth, Luke.

465
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:01,610
Told ya, bro.

466
00:25:01,611 --> 00:25:03,512
Crash and burn.

467
00:25:03,513 --> 00:25:04,680
You just never listen.

468
00:25:04,681 --> 00:25:07,683
Hey, you can't even see
with those glasses on.

469
00:25:07,684 --> 00:25:10,824
Smooth moves.

470
00:25:10,853 --> 00:25:12,730
Case, you hear something?

471
00:25:12,756 --> 00:25:15,134
You know, I didn't
hear anything, man.

472
00:25:15,993 --> 00:25:17,131
Don't waste your time
on that chick, dude.

473
00:25:17,194 --> 00:25:19,299
She's some kind of Jesus freak.

474
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:21,241
She'll just try to convert you.

475
00:25:21,265 --> 00:25:22,266
Yeah, I'll take my chances.

476
00:25:22,299 --> 00:25:24,100
Thanks.

477
00:25:24,101 --> 00:25:26,274
I'm Matt, by the way.

478
00:25:26,303 --> 00:25:28,037
Yeah, I'm Luke.

479
00:25:28,038 --> 00:25:31,111
This is Case.

480
00:25:31,142 --> 00:25:33,383
Yeah, we met the other day
at the surf shop.

481
00:25:33,411 --> 00:25:35,246
He was bragging all about you.

482
00:25:35,247 --> 00:25:36,123
Saying you're the only one

483
00:25:36,148 --> 00:25:38,816
in my way of that
spot on the team.

484
00:25:38,817 --> 00:25:39,784
Thanks, Case.

485
00:25:39,785 --> 00:25:41,093
Just telling it like it is,
my man.

486
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:42,689
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

487
00:25:42,721 --> 00:25:43,961
Alright, well, I'm telling
you guys like it is.

488
00:25:44,556 --> 00:25:48,334
That spot is mine.

489
00:25:48,661 --> 00:25:51,663
You come over here
and introduce yourself,

490
00:25:51,664 --> 00:25:54,132
and then you start
acting like a kook!

491
00:25:54,133 --> 00:25:55,407
Kook!

492
00:25:55,434 --> 00:26:00,272
I can out-surf you
any day of the week.

493
00:26:00,273 --> 00:26:02,117
In your dreams.

494
00:26:02,142 --> 00:26:05,311
Yeah? I'll, I'll take
you on right now!

495
00:26:05,312 --> 00:26:06,416
I don't know
if you've noticed...

496
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,282
but it's dark.

497
00:26:09,283 --> 00:26:12,287
And I'm kinda drunk.

498
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:13,627
Okay. Okay.

499
00:26:13,954 --> 00:26:15,991
Excuses.

500
00:26:16,023 --> 00:26:18,231
Tomorrow then, at The Point.

501
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:19,369
What time?

502
00:26:19,394 --> 00:26:20,600
8:30.

503
00:26:20,628 --> 00:26:24,264
Okay.

504
00:26:24,265 --> 00:26:25,365
Better show up.

505
00:26:25,366 --> 00:26:28,569
Oh, I'll be there.

506
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:31,449
You can believe that guy?

507
00:26:31,473 --> 00:26:34,580
Listen, that spot?

508
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:38,183
All yours.

509
00:26:38,213 --> 00:26:39,248
That's what
I'm talkin' about, man.

510
00:26:39,281 --> 00:26:40,225
That's what I'm talkin' about.

511
00:26:40,249 --> 00:26:40,522
Come here.

512
00:26:40,549 --> 00:26:42,187
Bring it up, come here.

513
00:26:42,218 --> 00:26:43,184
I love you, Lukester.

514
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:44,323
Dude, you're my boy.

515
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:45,453
You're my boy.

516
00:26:45,454 --> 00:26:46,489
I want some taquitos.

517
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:48,224
Dude, let's do it.

518
00:26:48,225 --> 00:26:50,637
7-11, I'm hungry.

519
00:27:09,613 --> 00:27:12,457
One too many there, buddy boy?

520
00:27:12,483 --> 00:27:14,517
What are you talking about?

521
00:27:14,518 --> 00:27:17,187
How do you think
this reﬂects on me?

522
00:27:17,188 --> 00:27:18,394
Dad, you need to chill.

523
00:27:18,557 --> 00:27:20,224
Chill?

524
00:27:20,225 --> 00:27:22,136
I'm a police officer, Luke.

525
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,227
And my teenage son's Out There

526
00:27:23,228 --> 00:27:26,573
running around drinking
and getting drunk?

527
00:27:27,099 --> 00:27:29,579
Should have never let you
stay home from church.

528
00:27:29,635 --> 00:27:32,582
Church?

529
00:27:32,971 --> 00:27:36,275
The only reason
you go to church, Dad,

530
00:27:36,276 --> 00:27:40,278
is because Mom makes you.

531
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:44,489
You're about as much
Christian as I am.

532
00:27:44,717 --> 00:27:46,818
We're through here.

533
00:27:46,819 --> 00:27:48,730
You're grounded until
you learn some respect

534
00:27:48,755 --> 00:27:52,425
for me, your mother,
and yourself.

535
00:27:52,426 --> 00:27:53,530
You can't ground me!

536
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,595
I just did!

537
00:27:54,628 --> 00:27:56,767
My house, my rules.

538
00:27:56,797 --> 00:27:59,666
I have to be at the beach
in the morning.

539
00:27:59,667 --> 00:28:01,567
Not tomorrow, you don't.

540
00:28:01,568 --> 00:28:02,478
You're gonna stay in your room

541
00:28:02,503 --> 00:28:04,609
until you change
your attitude, Luke.

542
00:28:04,639 --> 00:28:08,644
What happened
to this plan of yours?

543
00:28:08,676 --> 00:28:09,711
You know what?

544
00:28:09,744 --> 00:28:10,586
Why don't you go to your room

545
00:28:10,612 --> 00:28:12,592
before I decide to take
something else away from you?

546
00:28:12,614 --> 00:28:17,620
And don't wake your mom
up when you go upstairs.

547
00:29:12,544 --> 00:29:14,820
Crazy kid!

548
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:25,436
Hey, thought you'd never show.

549
00:29:25,458 --> 00:29:26,562
Guess you thought wrong.

550
00:29:26,593 --> 00:29:27,571
Are you ready
for an old-fashioned

551
00:29:27,594 --> 00:29:28,732
butt-whooppin?

552
00:29:29,129 --> 00:29:30,229
Yeah, we'll see.

553
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:32,904
Let's do it.

554
00:30:33,931 --> 00:30:34,909
Where you two been?

555
00:30:34,932 --> 00:30:36,673
I'll tell you where we've been.

556
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,000
Your son deliberately
disobeyed me

557
00:30:38,001 --> 00:30:39,903
and went surfing this morning,
knowing full well

558
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:41,906
he wasn't supposed
to leave his room.

559
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:42,806
You know, it's safe to say

560
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:43,751
you're going to be
on restriction

561
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:45,721
for the rest of your
natural-born life, pal.

562
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:49,850
So, up to your room.

563
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,020
Was that necessary?

564
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:58,156
Your son came home
stinking drunk last night.

565
00:30:58,157 --> 00:30:59,135
So I put him on restriction.

566
00:30:59,158 --> 00:31:03,038
That means in his room,
and that means no surfing!

567
00:31:03,162 --> 00:31:05,430
Have you ever
watched him surf, David?

568
00:31:05,431 --> 00:31:08,433
I mean, really watched him?

569
00:31:08,434 --> 00:31:10,608
God has given him a gift.

570
00:31:10,637 --> 00:31:11,775
I don't care if God
gave him a surfboard

571
00:31:11,805 --> 00:31:13,443
from the burning bush.

572
00:31:13,473 --> 00:31:14,573
He disobeyed me!

573
00:31:14,574 --> 00:31:15,678
Oh, whatever.

574
00:31:15,709 --> 00:31:16,551
You know what?

575
00:31:16,576 --> 00:31:19,682
If I don't start getting some
respect from you or him,

576
00:31:19,713 --> 00:31:21,556
then maybe we should start
thinking about another plan.

577
00:31:21,581 --> 00:31:23,822
Why... what is that
supposed to mean?

578
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:24,727
Luke's getting older,

579
00:31:24,752 --> 00:31:27,562
he's almost done with school.

580
00:31:27,855 --> 00:31:29,856
Maybe we need to be done, too.

581
00:31:29,857 --> 00:31:30,927
Where is this coming from?

582
00:31:30,958 --> 00:31:32,096
You cannot be serious.

583
00:31:32,126 --> 00:31:33,696
I gotta go.

584
00:31:33,728 --> 00:31:34,729
Where are you gonna go?

585
00:31:34,762 --> 00:31:35,137
It's Saturday!

586
00:31:35,162 --> 00:31:36,163
What are you talking about?

587
00:31:36,497 --> 00:31:38,331
Somebody's gotta
make money around here!

588
00:31:38,332 --> 00:31:39,666
I'm getting sick
of your real estate deal.

589
00:31:39,667 --> 00:31:41,909
Fine, you know what, just go!

590
00:31:51,446 --> 00:31:53,781
Yo, dude.

591
00:31:53,782 --> 00:31:55,884
Hey.

592
00:31:55,885 --> 00:31:58,024
Sorry about your dad
showing up.

593
00:31:58,054 --> 00:31:59,054
Yeah, whatever.

594
00:31:59,055 --> 00:32:01,092
I had you anyways.

595
00:32:01,124 --> 00:32:04,037
Right.

596
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,698
One spot. On that team.

597
00:32:05,728 --> 00:32:07,036
It's all mine.

598
00:32:07,063 --> 00:32:08,974
Dude, keep dreaming.

599
00:32:08,998 --> 00:32:11,741
Later.

600
00:32:17,574 --> 00:32:18,508
What's up dude?

601
00:32:18,509 --> 00:32:19,776
What's goin' on, man?

602
00:32:19,777 --> 00:32:21,911
I just seen you
conversing with the enemy.

603
00:32:21,912 --> 00:32:23,050
What, are you kidding me?

604
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,150
That guy?

605
00:32:24,181 --> 00:32:26,719
Yeah right, man.

606
00:32:26,751 --> 00:32:27,752
He can surf though.

607
00:32:27,786 --> 00:32:29,129
I'll give him that.

608
00:32:29,154 --> 00:32:31,055
So we hanging out after school?

609
00:32:31,056 --> 00:32:32,797
Are you kidding me, man?

610
00:32:32,824 --> 00:32:37,127
I think I'm on restriction
for the rest of my life.

611
00:32:37,128 --> 00:32:39,039
I'm sorry, bro, I'm sorry.

612
00:32:39,064 --> 00:32:41,875
It's not worth it, man.

613
00:32:41,901 --> 00:32:43,034
Well, you wanna
get out of here?

614
00:32:43,035 --> 00:32:46,073
Yeah, man, let's do it.

615
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,110
I hope so, I hope so.

616
00:32:52,111 --> 00:32:54,853
I feel like I'm getting
through to some of them, so...

617
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,761
Is that son of yours
ever on time?

618
00:32:58,785 --> 00:32:59,952
Would you like
some more coffee?

619
00:32:59,953 --> 00:33:00,953
I'm fine, thank you.

620
00:33:00,954 --> 00:33:01,796
Hey Mom.

621
00:33:01,822 --> 00:33:03,768
Oh, here he is.

622
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:05,791
Dad, you're home early.

623
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:06,896
Don't get wise, Luke.

624
00:33:06,927 --> 00:33:08,702
Sweetie, I'd like you
to meet somebody.

625
00:33:08,729 --> 00:33:09,799
This is Pastor Shane.

626
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:12,106
He's the new high school
leader at church.

627
00:33:12,634 --> 00:33:15,638
What's this all about?

628
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:18,674
What's up Luke, I'm Shane.

629
00:33:19,207 --> 00:33:19,639
Hey.

630
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,375
I just... I thought
it would be really good

631
00:33:21,376 --> 00:33:22,514
for you two to meet.

632
00:33:22,543 --> 00:33:23,453
Why?

633
00:33:23,478 --> 00:33:25,458
Watch it.

634
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,289
You know, I was just
telling your parents

635
00:33:27,315 --> 00:33:28,294
about some cool things
that are happening

636
00:33:28,317 --> 00:33:30,524
down at church,
think you might like.

637
00:33:30,552 --> 00:33:32,453
Cool things in church.

638
00:33:32,454 --> 00:33:33,354
Right.

639
00:33:33,355 --> 00:33:34,356
Luke!

640
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:36,370
Sorry.

641
00:33:36,392 --> 00:33:40,395
Pastor Shane, church
really isn't my thing.

642
00:33:40,396 --> 00:33:43,432
Sorry.

643
00:33:43,433 --> 00:33:44,571
Luke.

644
00:33:45,235 --> 00:33:46,213
Luke!

645
00:33:47,604 --> 00:33:50,448
I am so sorry about that.

646
00:33:50,473 --> 00:33:52,214
No worries.

647
00:33:52,242 --> 00:33:54,376
Comes with the job it's okay.

648
00:33:54,377 --> 00:33:55,481
He'll be at church, Pastor,

649
00:33:55,512 --> 00:33:58,517
even if I have to
drag him there myself.

650
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:02,463
Hey, you.

651
00:34:02,653 --> 00:34:04,929
Oh, uh, hey.

652
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:08,892
Uh, sorry we left
the party the other night.

653
00:34:08,893 --> 00:34:10,566
It's not really my thing.

654
00:34:10,895 --> 00:34:13,931
It was kind of a lame
party, anyways.

655
00:34:13,932 --> 00:34:16,606
And I got way too drunk.

656
00:34:16,935 --> 00:34:19,904
Yeah, I kinda noticed that.

657
00:34:19,905 --> 00:34:23,751
You know, you should
really be careful.

658
00:34:23,775 --> 00:34:27,878
Careful, right.

659
00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:31,383
Oh, I heard you
go to Beach-side.

660
00:34:31,384 --> 00:34:32,795
Yeah, I do.

661
00:34:33,252 --> 00:34:35,061
Do you go there?

662
00:34:35,088 --> 00:34:36,455
Uh, I guess I do now.

663
00:34:36,456 --> 00:34:37,456
Cool.

664
00:34:37,457 --> 00:34:40,836
My parents are making me
go to youth group, too.

665
00:34:41,194 --> 00:34:44,229
Punishment
for the other night, so...

666
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:45,898
Well, um...

667
00:34:45,899 --> 00:34:47,879
maybe it'll do you some good.

668
00:34:47,901 --> 00:34:48,902
You know, some of us

669
00:34:48,936 --> 00:34:52,004
actually enjoy going to church.

670
00:34:52,005 --> 00:34:53,609
Right.

671
00:34:53,641 --> 00:34:54,813
Sorry.

672
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:56,788
Um, well, maybe
I'll see you there.

673
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:59,980
Yeah, yeah, maybe.

674
00:34:59,981 --> 00:35:02,860
Well, um, uh, I...

675
00:35:02,884 --> 00:35:03,919
I have to get going
before my dad

676
00:35:03,952 --> 00:35:06,660
sends a patrol car
after me, so...

677
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:09,823
Yeah, I actually
gotta go too, so...

678
00:35:09,824 --> 00:35:12,593
Maybe I'll see you around?

679
00:35:12,594 --> 00:35:14,870
If you're lucky.

680
00:35:37,354 --> 00:35:39,425
Don't ruin your appetite.

681
00:35:39,456 --> 00:35:41,834
Hey Mom?

682
00:35:42,292 --> 00:35:45,205
I was just wondering...

683
00:35:45,228 --> 00:35:50,201
are you and Dad happy?

684
00:35:50,234 --> 00:35:54,011
What brought this up?

685
00:35:54,272 --> 00:35:57,774
I heard you guys
talking the other day.

686
00:35:57,775 --> 00:35:59,910
Didn't sound too good.

687
00:35:59,911 --> 00:36:03,080
Honey, your father's under
a lot of pressure at work.

688
00:36:03,081 --> 00:36:06,918
Don't worry, everything's fine.

689
00:36:06,919 --> 00:36:10,755
This is all my fault isn't it?

690
00:36:10,756 --> 00:36:11,856
No, this...

691
00:36:11,857 --> 00:36:12,892
why are you saying that?

692
00:36:12,925 --> 00:36:15,030
No.

693
00:36:15,227 --> 00:36:16,205
Your father and I love you

694
00:36:16,228 --> 00:36:19,073
more than anything
in this world.

695
00:36:19,098 --> 00:36:22,000
Okay?

696
00:36:22,001 --> 00:36:24,208
Okay.

697
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:28,585
What does the world "integrity"

698
00:36:28,608 --> 00:36:33,012
mean to you guys?

699
00:36:33,013 --> 00:36:34,151
Abby.

700
00:36:34,181 --> 00:36:36,282
Isn't it like being
totally honest.

701
00:36:36,283 --> 00:36:39,821
Even when
no one else is watching?

702
00:36:40,054 --> 00:36:42,055
Exactly.

703
00:36:42,056 --> 00:36:45,230
It's the decisions we make
when we're alone.

704
00:36:45,259 --> 00:36:46,966
It's that little voice
inside that says,

705
00:36:46,994 --> 00:36:49,908
"I'm not gonna do this...

706
00:36:49,931 --> 00:36:52,933
even though I probably
won't get caught."

707
00:36:52,934 --> 00:36:57,104
Or "I am gonna do this",

708
00:36:57,105 --> 00:36:58,205
because it is
the right thing to do...

709
00:36:58,206 --> 00:37:02,552
"even though it's not always
the coolest thing to do."

710
00:37:02,577 --> 00:37:04,956
Can anyone give me an example?

711
00:37:05,448 --> 00:37:06,715
Yeah, Danny?

712
00:37:06,716 --> 00:37:07,990
What about when
you're surfing the Web,

713
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:09,985
and maybe you're
tempted to go to a site

714
00:37:09,986 --> 00:37:11,829
that you know you're
not supposed to be on?

715
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:12,921
And you don't go there?

716
00:37:12,922 --> 00:37:13,923
Good.

717
00:37:13,956 --> 00:37:15,731
And how would you know?

718
00:37:15,758 --> 00:37:16,702
Hey guys, cool it.

719
00:37:16,726 --> 00:37:18,761
We've all been there.

720
00:37:18,762 --> 00:37:20,997
Anyone else?

721
00:37:20,998 --> 00:37:21,976
Jessica.

722
00:37:21,999 --> 00:37:23,900
It's honoring your parents.

723
00:37:23,901 --> 00:37:27,144
Exactly, exactly.

724
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:32,381
What about you, Luke?

725
00:37:32,943 --> 00:37:35,185
What does "integrity"
mean to you?

726
00:37:35,213 --> 00:37:38,148
Uh, yeah, they're both right.

727
00:37:38,149 --> 00:37:40,183
You think I'm gonna
let you off that easy?

728
00:37:40,184 --> 00:37:42,130
Come on, man.

729
00:37:42,153 --> 00:37:45,088
Example from your life
anything at all.

730
00:37:45,089 --> 00:37:46,159
What do you mean?

731
00:37:46,191 --> 00:37:49,139
Okay, why are you here?

732
00:37:49,161 --> 00:37:50,261
Well, the only reason I'm here

733
00:37:50,262 --> 00:37:54,176
is because I made
a promise to my Mom.

734
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:57,068
You, re here, aren't you?

735
00:37:57,069 --> 00:37:59,242
Keeping that promise?

736
00:37:59,271 --> 00:38:02,218
That's integrity.

737
00:38:02,241 --> 00:38:05,010
Keeping your commitments...

738
00:38:05,011 --> 00:38:07,287
to God and to others.

739
00:38:21,963 --> 00:38:25,231
Did you get Luke off
to youth group on time?

740
00:38:25,232 --> 00:38:28,941
Do you see him?

741
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:30,103
Of course I got him
there on time.

742
00:38:30,104 --> 00:38:31,981
Pastor Shane's gonna
give him a ride home.

743
00:38:32,006 --> 00:38:34,213
Pastor Shane?

744
00:38:34,242 --> 00:38:34,947
Yeah.

745
00:38:34,976 --> 00:38:36,251
Why, why aren't you
picking him up?

746
00:38:36,445 --> 00:38:38,322
Because I have to work.

747
00:38:38,347 --> 00:38:40,224
You have to work
of course you do.

748
00:38:40,248 --> 00:38:42,558
Why did I even ask?

749
00:38:42,985 --> 00:38:46,398
Probably have to work during
our counseling session, too.

750
00:38:46,822 --> 00:38:48,489
See...

751
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:50,124
why do you assume that?

752
00:38:50,125 --> 00:38:53,428
If I say I'm gonna be there,
I'm gonna be there.

753
00:38:53,429 --> 00:38:55,067
'Cause I only
want you there, David,

754
00:38:55,098 --> 00:38:59,101
if you want to be there

755
00:38:59,102 --> 00:39:04,279
I wouldn't be going
unless I wanted to be there.

756
00:39:04,307 --> 00:39:07,050
Well, thank you.

757
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:14,296
Volvo's in the shop, huh?

758
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:15,885
YUP.

759
00:39:15,886 --> 00:39:18,867
Wouldn't be stuck here
if it wasn't.

760
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:23,964
Grab those Bibles for me?

761
00:39:23,995 --> 00:39:25,796
How's the surf been lately?

762
00:39:25,797 --> 00:39:27,003
Um...

763
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:29,705
been ﬂat as a lake
the last few days.

764
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:31,873
Bummer, man.

765
00:39:31,903 --> 00:39:33,804
Mom tells me you
want to surf for a living.

766
00:39:33,805 --> 00:39:34,905
Yeah.

767
00:39:34,906 --> 00:39:35,976
Yeah, I guess.

768
00:39:36,007 --> 00:39:37,976
That's great.

769
00:39:37,977 --> 00:39:40,753
How long you been surfing?

770
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:43,818
I don't know,
since I was little.

771
00:39:43,849 --> 00:39:46,022
Luke Harris...

772
00:39:46,452 --> 00:39:49,331
Pro Surfer.

773
00:39:49,355 --> 00:39:50,922
Could work.

774
00:39:50,923 --> 00:39:52,925
Could work?

775
00:39:52,926 --> 00:39:54,928
Now what's that
supposed to mean?

776
00:39:55,429 --> 00:39:58,342
Pretty big commitment
making that level.

777
00:39:58,365 --> 00:40:01,267
Even harder staying there.

778
00:40:01,268 --> 00:40:03,179
Oh, and you know...

779
00:40:03,203 --> 00:40:06,275
you know all about that.

780
00:40:06,306 --> 00:40:08,412
Look, man.

781
00:40:08,776 --> 00:40:10,811
You ever want to talk,

782
00:40:10,812 --> 00:40:12,814
my office is always open.

783
00:40:12,847 --> 00:40:14,155
Is that cool?

784
00:40:14,315 --> 00:40:16,249
Yeah, yeah that's cool.

785
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:19,052
Well, let's get you
out of here.

786
00:40:19,053 --> 00:40:19,986
You know, we got
<i>a</i> group of guys

787
00:40:19,987 --> 00:40:22,024
that go surfing here
all the time.

788
00:40:22,056 --> 00:40:23,263
You should come join us.

789
00:40:23,292 --> 00:40:24,930
Yeah.

790
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,201
I mean, you know, maybe.

791
00:40:32,367 --> 00:40:34,210
Oh, hey Mom.

792
00:40:34,236 --> 00:40:35,306
Hey Honey.

793
00:40:35,337 --> 00:40:36,338
How was work?

794
00:40:36,505 --> 00:40:38,452
You show any houses today?

795
00:40:38,475 --> 00:40:41,310
I finally got a real offer
on that Johnson's old house.

796
00:40:41,311 --> 00:40:41,618
That's great.

797
00:40:41,644 --> 00:40:43,345
Praise the Lord.

798
00:40:43,346 --> 00:40:44,813
How was school?

799
00:40:44,814 --> 00:40:45,781
Same old.

800
00:40:45,782 --> 00:40:47,955
Oh, hey, haw
was church last night?

801
00:40:48,251 --> 00:40:49,491
Oh, it was great.

802
00:40:49,819 --> 00:40:52,154
Pastor Shane's really cool.

803
00:40:52,155 --> 00:40:54,432
You don't sound too enthused.

804
00:40:54,458 --> 00:40:59,373
Eitherway, I am just
so proud of you for going.

805
00:40:59,396 --> 00:41:04,067
Life isn't always
about doing what we feel like,

806
00:41:04,068 --> 00:41:09,485
Kind of like you
staying married to Dad,

807
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:12,318
Lucas, listen.

808
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:13,345
We have to keep our promises,

809
00:41:13,378 --> 00:41:16,120
no matter how
we feel about them...

810
00:41:16,147 --> 00:41:18,349
and whether
it's a relationship,

811
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:20,284
or promising to be
somewhere every week,

812
00:41:20,285 --> 00:41:22,492
like your youth group.

813
00:41:22,821 --> 00:41:24,990
Sorry.

814
00:41:24,991 --> 00:41:26,197
Your father and I
are going to start counseling

815
00:41:26,225 --> 00:41:30,173
at church this week.

816
00:41:30,796 --> 00:41:34,699
This is just a season
in our lives, honey.

817
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:38,503
God's gonna see us
through this.

818
00:41:38,504 --> 00:41:39,642
Cool.

819
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:53,154
I'm so glad that you guys
are here today.

820
00:41:53,187 --> 00:41:57,102
Well, David, the fact that
you're here is really big.

821
00:41:57,125 --> 00:41:59,002
In a lot of situations
like this, when we do

822
00:41:59,027 --> 00:42:01,228
marital counseling,
a lot of times the husband

823
00:42:01,229 --> 00:42:03,063
doesn't even show up.

824
00:42:03,064 --> 00:42:05,374
And it's really awesome
that you're here.

825
00:42:05,767 --> 00:42:08,836
Well, she thought it would
do us some good, so.

826
00:42:08,837 --> 00:42:10,204
That's your answer?

827
00:42:10,205 --> 00:42:12,311
What?

828
00:42:12,341 --> 00:42:14,082
Never mind.

829
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:15,316
Here we go.

830
00:42:15,344 --> 00:42:18,518
See, Pastor, this is part
of the problem.

831
00:42:18,948 --> 00:42:21,216
I work really hard
for my family,

832
00:42:21,217 --> 00:42:23,128
putting my life on the
line every day that I put

833
00:42:23,152 --> 00:42:25,120
my badge and my gun on.

834
00:42:25,121 --> 00:42:29,502
And then I come to my own
home and I get no respect.

835
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,760
She even says grace
before we eat.

836
00:42:31,761 --> 00:42:33,295
Well, somebody has to.

837
00:42:33,296 --> 00:42:35,640
Well, maybe I would if you
gave me half a chance.

838
00:42:36,166 --> 00:42:38,237
But obviously the fact that
you're both here shows

839
00:42:38,268 --> 00:42:40,475
that you want some change
to happen in your relationship

840
00:42:40,503 --> 00:42:42,211
and to strengthen your family.

841
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,379
Is that correct?

842
00:42:44,408 --> 00:42:46,243
Good.

843
00:42:46,244 --> 00:42:48,451
Well, the Bible's
full of specific things?

844
00:42:48,479 --> 00:42:50,220
That you can build
your life upon,

845
00:42:50,248 --> 00:42:52,922
and it'll lay
a rock-solid foundation.

846
00:42:52,984 --> 00:42:54,292
But if you don't apply
it and you don't use it,

847
00:42:54,318 --> 00:42:56,320
it doesn't work.

848
00:42:56,688 --> 00:42:58,759
In the book of Joshua,
we hear one of the most

849
00:42:58,790 --> 00:43:01,669
significant quotes
in the entire Bible.

850
00:43:01,793 --> 00:43:04,629
In its word, Joshua is
addressing all the children

851
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:06,667
of the Israel and he tells 'em,

852
00:43:06,698 --> 00:43:12,672
"As for me and my house,
we will serve the Lord."

853
00:43:12,705 --> 00:43:14,606
And David, I want to
encourage you today.

854
00:43:14,607 --> 00:43:15,551
What are you gonna do?

855
00:43:15,575 --> 00:43:17,521
Who are you gonna serve?

856
00:43:17,544 --> 00:43:19,615
You've gotta make a choice.

857
00:43:19,646 --> 00:43:21,626
It's not based on your comfort.

858
00:43:21,648 --> 00:43:23,889
It's not based on convenience.

859
00:43:24,117 --> 00:43:25,551
But it's gotta be based on
a commitment that you make

860
00:43:25,552 --> 00:43:28,500
before God and your wife.

861
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:31,524
So as you leave here today,
think about it.

862
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:33,527
Who are you gonna serve?

863
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:42,504
How many more chips you got...

864
00:43:42,804 --> 00:43:43,805
Hey.

865
00:43:43,838 --> 00:43:46,717
Oh, hey.

866
00:43:46,741 --> 00:43:48,442
Oh, have you met Casey?

867
00:43:48,443 --> 00:43:48,575
No.

868
00:43:48,576 --> 00:43:50,419
Um, hi, Casey.

869
00:43:50,445 --> 00:43:51,617
I'm Emily.

870
00:43:51,646 --> 00:43:53,080
Hey.

871
00:43:53,081 --> 00:43:55,493
It's nice to meet you.

872
00:43:55,850 --> 00:43:58,388
How's it going?

873
00:43:59,121 --> 00:44:03,092
So, um, the youth group is
going to Boomers this Saturday.

874
00:44:03,125 --> 00:44:04,297
You should totally come.

875
00:44:04,694 --> 00:44:05,832
To Boomers?

876
00:44:06,062 --> 00:44:07,939
Oh, wow.

877
00:44:07,963 --> 00:44:12,002
I mean, I haven't been
to Boomers since I was little.

878
00:44:12,034 --> 00:44:12,808
Right, I get it.

879
00:44:12,835 --> 00:44:15,043
It's not cool enough for you.

880
00:44:15,072 --> 00:44:15,982
Oh, no, no, no.

881
00:44:16,006 --> 00:44:17,473
Not at all.

882
00:44:17,474 --> 00:44:19,750
Ah actually, it sounds
like a lot of fun.

883
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:22,047
Cool.

884
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:24,821
And, Casey, you can
totally come too.

885
00:44:24,848 --> 00:44:26,382
It'd be really fun.

886
00:44:26,383 --> 00:44:28,317
It sounds, sounds good.

887
00:44:28,318 --> 00:44:31,562
Great, so I guess
I'll see you later?

888
00:44:31,589 --> 00:44:32,363
Totally.

889
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:33,562
Alright bye.

890
00:44:36,561 --> 00:44:40,566
Are you serious?

891
00:44:40,832 --> 00:44:42,366
My mouth was full, bro!

892
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:44,746
I couldn't get a word out. Okay?

893
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:48,649
Seriously man, like, video arcades
are an the comeback.

894
00:44:48,674 --> 00:44:50,676
You just mark my words.

895
00:44:50,909 --> 00:44:51,943
Fine.

896
00:44:51,944 --> 00:44:53,582
But if you want
to go to Boomers,

897
00:44:53,612 --> 00:44:57,526
then you have to go
to youth group with me.

898
00:45:00,887 --> 00:45:01,991
Youth group?

899
00:45:12,632 --> 00:45:13,702
Still up?

900
00:45:13,733 --> 00:45:14,803
Yep.

901
00:45:14,834 --> 00:45:16,906
Just finishing up
some homework.

902
00:45:16,938 --> 00:45:19,748
Well, your father and I talked.

903
00:45:19,774 --> 00:45:21,811
And we think it's about time
you're off restriction.

904
00:45:24,512 --> 00:45:25,650
Thanks, Mom.

905
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,752
You think you can stay
out of trouble this time?

906
00:45:28,783 --> 00:45:30,559
Yeah.

907
00:45:30,585 --> 00:45:31,719
I won't let you down.

908
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:32,787
Alright.

909
00:45:32,788 --> 00:45:35,589
Why don't you finish up and
get yourself some sleep, okay?

910
00:45:35,590 --> 00:45:35,863
Okay.

911
00:45:35,891 --> 00:45:36,801
Love you.

912
00:45:36,825 --> 00:45:38,702
Goodnight.

913
00:46:26,611 --> 00:46:27,851
By a show of hands,

914
00:46:28,213 --> 00:46:32,185
How many have ever done
something they may regret?

915
00:46:34,153 --> 00:46:36,121
All right.

916
00:46:36,122 --> 00:46:38,033
How many wish you could
undo what you did?

917
00:46:42,995 --> 00:46:43,962
I forgot lunch.

918
00:46:43,963 --> 00:46:45,135
I'm sorry, guys.

919
00:46:45,164 --> 00:46:46,302
You guys don't mind?

920
00:46:46,332 --> 00:46:48,279
Anyone hungry?

921
00:46:48,301 --> 00:46:49,135
Casey, right?

922
00:46:49,136 --> 00:46:50,002
Yeah.

923
00:46:50,003 --> 00:46:50,947
All right, let's see.

924
00:46:50,971 --> 00:46:51,303
Here you go.

925
00:46:51,304 --> 00:46:55,343
Anyone else?

926
00:46:55,375 --> 00:46:59,551
Uh, I think my banana's defective.

927
00:46:59,579 --> 00:47:01,718
Looks whole on the
outside, doesn't it?

928
00:47:02,082 --> 00:47:07,083
But on the inside
it's cut to pieces.

929
00:47:07,855 --> 00:47:12,392
This banana is like
our lives without Christ.

930
00:47:12,393 --> 00:47:17,638
But God, God is always
there to pick up the pieces,

931
00:47:18,065 --> 00:47:20,842
no matter how bad we mess up.

932
00:49:11,887 --> 00:49:12,922
Hey guys.

933
00:49:12,955 --> 00:49:14,161
A bunch of us are going
to go for pizza.

934
00:49:14,189 --> 00:49:15,823
Do you want to come with?

935
00:49:15,824 --> 00:49:17,201
Yeah, totally.

936
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:20,532
Yeah, um, but Casey just
got his license today,

937
00:49:20,829 --> 00:49:21,900
so I'll ride with him.

938
00:49:21,932 --> 00:49:23,070
No way!

939
00:49:23,099 --> 00:49:24,066
Yep, about time.

940
00:49:24,067 --> 00:49:25,171
Bout time, I know.

941
00:49:25,201 --> 00:49:26,043
Well, that's perfect

942
00:49:26,069 --> 00:49:27,241
I guess we'll just
go in Jessica's car

943
00:49:27,671 --> 00:49:28,809
and we'll meet you there.

944
00:49:29,038 --> 00:49:30,906
Yeah, that sounds great.

945
00:49:30,907 --> 00:49:31,907
- Okay.
- I'll see you there.

946
00:49:31,908 --> 00:49:33,216
- Bye.
- It was fun.

947
00:49:33,243 --> 00:49:35,223
Yeah.

948
00:49:41,152 --> 00:49:46,226
Dude, Emily,
she really likes you, bro.

949
00:49:47,291 --> 00:49:48,326
Oh, you think?

950
00:49:48,425 --> 00:49:50,393
Oh, I know, man.

951
00:49:50,394 --> 00:49:53,239
Don't mess this up, Lukester.

952
00:49:53,265 --> 00:49:55,404
She could be the one.

953
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:58,002
Ya know, she is pretty cool.

954
00:49:58,003 --> 00:50:00,137
Dude, can you believe
we're hanging

955
00:50:00,138 --> 00:50:04,052
with church girls right now
and it's actually awesome?

956
00:50:04,076 --> 00:50:07,923
You're telling me.

957
00:50:07,947 --> 00:50:10,154
Thanks for inviting me, man.

958
00:50:10,183 --> 00:50:13,318
I mean, all the stuff
I have to deal with at home.

959
00:50:13,319 --> 00:50:17,893
You know, my mom's new boyfriend.

960
00:50:17,924 --> 00:50:22,895
I guess I just never
knew there was a God,

961
00:50:22,896 --> 00:50:29,973
let alone that he actually
cares for me, you know?

962
00:50:30,004 --> 00:50:32,143
Case.

963
00:50:32,573 --> 00:50:36,544
You're actually serious
about this Jesus stuff, huh?

964
00:50:36,577 --> 00:50:41,315
Wow!, I guess I am.

965
00:50:41,316 --> 00:50:45,458
Who knew?

966
00:50:45,487 --> 00:50:46,522
Casey!

967
00:51:30,902 --> 00:51:32,769
Hey.

968
00:51:32,770 --> 00:51:35,172
How's he doing?

969
00:51:35,173 --> 00:51:36,345
He's resting.

970
00:51:53,325 --> 00:51:58,326
Janet, I'm so sorry.

971
00:52:00,166 --> 00:52:02,271
I've been doing
a lot of thinking.

972
00:52:02,302 --> 00:52:07,206
I've been going about
everything all wrong.

973
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:09,483
You and Luke are the most
important thing to me.

974
00:52:09,509 --> 00:52:12,423
And I promise from now on,

975
00:52:12,446 --> 00:52:16,292
things are gonna be
totally different.

976
00:52:16,317 --> 00:52:18,228
You promise?

977
00:52:18,252 --> 00:52:19,595
I promise.

978
00:52:20,054 --> 00:52:21,354
I love you so much.

979
00:52:21,355 --> 00:52:22,265
I love you too.

980
00:52:22,289 --> 00:52:25,600
I'm sorry.

981
00:52:25,626 --> 00:52:28,437
Hey, would you two
get a room already?

982
00:52:28,463 --> 00:52:30,272
Hey.

983
00:52:30,298 --> 00:52:30,742
Look who's up.

984
00:52:31,266 --> 00:52:33,507
How are you doing, buddy?

985
00:52:33,535 --> 00:52:37,312
Pretty sore.

986
00:52:37,339 --> 00:52:39,341
Oh, how's Case?

987
00:52:39,374 --> 00:52:40,641
Listen, why don't you
get some rest?

988
00:52:40,642 --> 00:52:43,681
It's been a long day.

989
00:52:43,713 --> 00:52:45,680
Yeah, but Dad,
how's Casey doing?

990
00:52:45,681 --> 00:52:49,288
Honey, you need
to get your rest.

991
00:52:52,455 --> 00:52:54,401
What's going on?

992
00:52:57,894 --> 00:53:00,896
He didn't make it, son.

993
00:53:00,897 --> 00:53:02,604
What... what are you
talking about?

994
00:53:02,633 --> 00:53:05,968
Where's Casey?

995
00:53:05,969 --> 00:53:07,803
I'm so sorry.

996
00:53:07,804 --> 00:53:08,839
You're lying to me.

997
00:53:08,872 --> 00:53:11,011
You're lying to me!

998
00:53:11,708 --> 00:53:12,609
Lucas, listen.

999
00:53:12,610 --> 00:53:12,976
Stop it.

1000
00:53:12,977 --> 00:53:13,887
No, get off of me.

1001
00:53:13,911 --> 00:53:15,618
No, he's outside.

1002
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:16,647
Let me go.

1003
00:53:16,648 --> 00:53:16,947
It's gonna be okay.

1004
00:53:16,948 --> 00:53:17,892
Don't touch me.

1005
00:53:17,916 --> 00:53:18,894
Lucas, you need to get some...

1006
00:53:18,917 --> 00:53:20,584
Don't touch me!

1007
00:53:20,585 --> 00:53:20,984
No, I don't!

1008
00:53:20,985 --> 00:53:21,985
Where's Casey?

1009
00:53:21,986 --> 00:53:22,930
Come here, come here.

1010
00:53:22,954 --> 00:53:25,594
No, get off of me!

1011
00:53:25,890 --> 00:53:27,028
Stop it!

1012
00:53:29,294 --> 00:53:30,329
Sweetie...

1013
00:53:34,066 --> 00:53:35,136
Come on.

1014
00:53:36,101 --> 00:53:38,877
I know where he is.

1015
00:53:54,221 --> 00:53:56,827
Hey.

1016
00:54:00,227 --> 00:54:02,036
It was a nice service.

1017
00:54:05,099 --> 00:54:08,478
What are you still doing here?

1018
00:54:09,437 --> 00:54:12,509
I don't think I'll ever
get used to this place.

1019
00:54:15,344 --> 00:54:17,415
I'm really sorry about
your friend, Luke.

1020
00:54:22,017 --> 00:54:24,759
Thanks.

1021
00:54:24,786 --> 00:54:27,062
Do you want to talk about it?

1022
00:54:27,589 --> 00:54:29,592
Not really.

1023
00:54:39,802 --> 00:54:41,975
He never got to surf.

1024
00:54:46,944 --> 00:54:54,795
I should have made him
get out there just once.

1025
00:54:55,752 --> 00:54:59,701
I know that it really
hurts right now.

1026
00:54:59,858 --> 00:55:02,930
I know.

1027
00:55:03,195 --> 00:55:06,296
You just have to trust
that God's in control.

1028
00:55:06,297 --> 00:55:13,146
And this is all part
of His plan for our lives.

1029
00:55:13,171 --> 00:55:17,086
God's plan.

1030
00:55:17,109 --> 00:55:20,215
Casey had his license
for, like, a day,

1031
00:55:20,446 --> 00:55:24,519
and now he's dead.

1032
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:27,629
What kind of plan is that?

1033
00:55:27,653 --> 00:55:30,031
Maybe you should talk
to Pastor Shane about it.

1034
00:55:30,457 --> 00:55:35,094
Pastor Shane? Pastor Shane?

1035
00:55:35,095 --> 00:55:38,898
I'm never setting foot
in that place again.

1036
00:55:38,899 --> 00:55:41,100
You don't mean that.

1037
00:55:41,101 --> 00:55:45,072
I just think that
it would help.

1038
00:55:45,105 --> 00:55:48,041
Help.

1039
00:55:48,042 --> 00:55:51,046
If I hadn't brought
Casey to church,

1040
00:55:51,078 --> 00:55:53,786
he'd still be here.

1041
00:55:53,815 --> 00:55:55,089
It's little late for help.

1042
00:55:55,383 --> 00:55:57,918
No, it's not.

1043
00:55:57,919 --> 00:55:59,193
It's not too late.

1044
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:01,232
God cares about us and He wants

1045
00:56:01,256 --> 00:56:04,135
what's best for us, Luke.

1046
00:56:06,061 --> 00:56:10,009
So Casey dying
is what's best for us.

1047
00:56:14,636 --> 00:56:16,905
You're pathetic.

1048
00:56:16,906 --> 00:56:18,852
Pathetic?

1049
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:21,947
Do you honestly think
that you're the only person

1050
00:56:21,978 --> 00:56:24,982
in the world that's ever gone
through something like this?

1051
00:56:25,448 --> 00:56:28,917
Spare me.

1052
00:56:28,918 --> 00:56:31,923
You have no idea what
I'm going through right now.

1053
00:56:31,956 --> 00:56:33,799
Really?

1054
00:56:37,094 --> 00:56:41,798
You see that cross
over there on the hill?

1055
00:56:41,799 --> 00:56:44,905
Do you see it?

1056
00:56:44,935 --> 00:56:47,006
Yeah.

1057
00:56:47,339 --> 00:56:50,479
What's the point?

1058
00:56:50,509 --> 00:56:54,116
A year and a half ago,
we buried my dad there.

1059
00:56:56,148 --> 00:57:00,255
That was the hardest thing
I've ever had to go through.

1060
00:57:00,285 --> 00:57:03,130
I thought my life was over.

1061
00:57:03,156 --> 00:57:08,156
I hated the world
just like you, okay?

1062
00:57:09,028 --> 00:57:12,407
When I finally got the strength
to open up my Bible again,

1063
00:57:12,932 --> 00:57:17,933
the first verse I came
to was Proverbs 3:5.

1064
00:57:19,106 --> 00:57:21,007
"Trust in the Lord, your God,
with all your heart

1065
00:57:21,008 --> 00:57:23,352
and lean not unto
your own understanding."

1066
00:57:26,213 --> 00:57:31,184
You see, if my dad hadn't
have died when he did,

1067
00:57:31,185 --> 00:57:35,100
then my mom and I never
would have moved back here.

1068
00:57:35,123 --> 00:57:38,192
And I never would have met you.

1069
00:57:38,193 --> 00:57:40,104
Emily...

1070
00:57:40,128 --> 00:57:45,168
God has a plan for you
and me and Casey.

1071
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:49,237
And sometimes it's amazing,
and it's wonderful.

1072
00:57:49,238 --> 00:57:52,107
And sometimes it hurts.

1073
00:57:52,108 --> 00:57:57,217
And you want to just curl
up in a ball and die.

1074
00:57:57,246 --> 00:57:59,347
But He's always there.

1075
00:57:59,348 --> 00:58:01,049
He's always in control.

1076
00:58:01,050 --> 00:58:03,394
And He never stops loving us.

1077
00:58:12,329 --> 00:58:15,139
I gotta go.

1078
00:59:11,659 --> 00:59:15,072
Luke, what are you
doing here today?

1079
00:59:15,262 --> 00:59:17,139
My shift starts in a few minutes.

1080
00:59:17,164 --> 00:59:19,075
No, no, no, no.

1081
00:59:19,099 --> 00:59:22,302
You're on leave.

1082
00:59:22,303 --> 00:59:23,247
Leave?

1083
00:59:23,271 --> 00:59:25,139
I need this job, Carl.

1084
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:27,274
You don't need
to be here today.

1085
00:59:27,275 --> 00:59:30,154
Now, I want you to go
home and take it easy.

1086
00:59:30,178 --> 00:59:33,180
Your job will be wailing for you
when you're ready to come back.

1087
00:59:33,181 --> 00:59:36,317
You take as much time
as you need, okay?

1088
00:59:36,318 --> 00:59:38,390
I mean it.

1089
00:59:38,421 --> 00:59:40,492
Thanks, Carl.

1090
01:00:03,146 --> 01:00:05,314
Hey, bro.

1091
01:00:05,315 --> 01:00:09,086
Hey.

1092
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:12,222
Hey, man, I just wanted
to say I'm really sorry

1093
01:00:12,223 --> 01:00:14,396
about your buddy Casey.

1094
01:00:16,261 --> 01:00:19,263
Thanks.

1095
01:00:19,264 --> 01:00:22,165
Guy really cracked me up.

1096
01:00:22,166 --> 01:00:23,407
Wish I knew him better.

1097
01:00:29,008 --> 01:00:33,044
You would've liked him.

1098
01:00:33,045 --> 01:00:36,117
He was my best friend.

1099
01:00:37,884 --> 01:00:41,987
Well, maybe I'll catch you
in the lineup?

1100
01:00:41,988 --> 01:00:43,831
Yeah, maybe.

1101
01:00:43,857 --> 01:00:44,835
All right.

1102
01:00:44,858 --> 01:00:46,599
Take it easy.

1103
01:03:08,744 --> 01:03:10,746
I miss you, Casey.

1104
01:04:55,858 --> 01:04:58,626
What's up Luke?

1105
01:04:58,627 --> 01:04:59,928
Hey Pastor Shane.

1106
01:04:59,929 --> 01:05:01,806
Shane's just fine.

1107
01:05:01,831 --> 01:05:03,833
Oh, okay.

1108
01:05:03,867 --> 01:05:05,813
Mind if I sit?

1109
01:05:11,708 --> 01:05:13,745
Pretty fun day.

1110
01:05:13,777 --> 01:05:15,849
Why aren't you
out there tearing it up?

1111
01:05:18,816 --> 01:05:22,953
I haven't... I haven't
paddled out since...

1112
01:05:22,954 --> 01:05:25,855
since the, uh...

1113
01:05:25,856 --> 01:05:27,767
I got ya.

1114
01:05:31,596 --> 01:05:34,565
I'm really sorry about
your friend Casey.

1115
01:05:34,566 --> 01:05:38,139
Yeah, me too.

1116
01:05:38,270 --> 01:05:40,511
I've lost a buddy before.

1117
01:05:43,975 --> 01:05:45,956
Hurts for along time.

1118
01:05:45,979 --> 01:05:49,081
And honestly...

1119
01:05:49,082 --> 01:05:54,896
the pain never
completely goes away.

1120
01:05:54,921 --> 01:05:55,988
He was the only one
that really believed

1121
01:05:55,989 --> 01:05:57,923
in me, you know?

1122
01:05:57,924 --> 01:06:00,131
Yeah.

1123
01:06:00,526 --> 01:06:02,528
We all need buddies like that.

1124
01:06:02,529 --> 01:06:04,600
Back us no matter what.

1125
01:06:08,702 --> 01:06:09,976
What if it would have been me

1126
01:06:10,504 --> 01:06:13,883
that died instead of Casey?

1127
01:06:14,375 --> 01:06:17,644
I don't know where I'd be.

1128
01:06:17,645 --> 01:06:21,024
Never really cared
about it before.

1129
01:06:21,416 --> 01:06:24,260
You know, God, church,
religion, praying.

1130
01:06:24,285 --> 01:06:26,322
I mean.

1131
01:06:30,725 --> 01:06:33,969
Am I a bad person?

1132
01:06:34,497 --> 01:06:38,639
I don't think you're
a bad person, Luke.

1133
01:06:38,667 --> 01:06:39,667
And honestly, it doesn't matter

1134
01:06:39,668 --> 01:06:42,604
what I think or...

1135
01:06:42,605 --> 01:06:45,552
anyone else thinks.

1136
01:06:45,574 --> 01:06:46,917
You know, in the Bible

1137
01:06:46,942 --> 01:06:49,890
it says we all have sinned.

1138
01:06:50,580 --> 01:06:55,325
And we all fall short
of the glory of God.

1139
01:06:55,352 --> 01:06:56,285
That's why He sent Christ.

1140
01:06:56,286 --> 01:06:59,989
He sent His own sun
to die for us.

1141
01:06:59,990 --> 01:07:02,163
To wipe away all our sins.

1142
01:07:02,192 --> 01:07:09,042
And restore our
relationship with Him.

1143
01:07:09,067 --> 01:07:13,277
I invited Casey to youth group
to have a buddy there.

1144
01:07:13,304 --> 01:07:17,013
Someone to make
fun of it all with me.

1145
01:07:18,377 --> 01:07:23,486
But, of course, Casey
gives his life to Christ

1146
01:07:23,515 --> 01:07:26,587
and now he's in Heaven.

1147
01:07:26,619 --> 01:07:31,534
And I have no idea
where I'm gonna be.

1148
01:07:34,494 --> 01:07:36,496
You can change that.

1149
01:07:36,529 --> 01:07:39,271
You can change that
right here, right now.

1150
01:07:39,299 --> 01:07:40,899
Simple as that.

1151
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:43,847
Look at it this way.

1152
01:07:44,070 --> 01:07:46,380
It's like the ultimate
cutback on a wave.

1153
01:07:46,406 --> 01:07:50,076
You're going one direction...
and wham!

1154
01:07:50,077 --> 01:07:54,287
Your whole life changes course.

1155
01:07:54,315 --> 01:07:58,229
God... God has an
amazing adventure

1156
01:07:58,252 --> 01:08:01,087
for all of us,
including you, Luke.

1157
01:08:01,088 --> 01:08:05,292
But it's your decision to make.

1158
01:08:05,293 --> 01:08:10,140
It's either yes or no
to the gift that God.

1159
01:08:10,165 --> 01:08:15,171
Has given all of us,
which is salvation, man.

1160
01:08:23,312 --> 01:08:25,417
I'm hungry.

1161
01:08:25,448 --> 01:08:30,419
There's nothin' in there
you didn't see five minutes ago.

1162
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:31,831
Where's Luke?

1163
01:08:32,621 --> 01:08:33,656
Hm?

1164
01:08:34,190 --> 01:08:34,600
I'm so hungry.

1165
01:08:34,624 --> 01:08:38,528
Well, why don't you...
Hey, wait for dinner!

1166
01:08:38,529 --> 01:08:39,829
Go set the table.

1167
01:08:39,830 --> 01:08:41,173
All right.

1168
01:09:13,232 --> 01:09:14,210
Where you been?

1169
01:09:14,233 --> 01:09:15,371
I'm starvin' here.

1170
01:09:15,534 --> 01:09:16,808
Sorry, Dad.

1171
01:09:16,969 --> 01:09:20,471
It's alright.

1172
01:09:20,472 --> 01:09:21,543
Wow, this looks great.

1173
01:09:21,575 --> 01:09:22,541
Mm-hm.

1174
01:09:22,542 --> 01:09:24,385
Starved.

1175
01:09:26,546 --> 01:09:28,280
What's so funny?

1176
01:09:28,281 --> 01:09:31,262
Oh, mm, nothing, sorry.

1177
01:09:33,486 --> 01:09:36,627
Mind if I say grace tonight?

1178
01:09:36,658 --> 01:09:38,569
Of course not.

1179
01:09:42,330 --> 01:09:44,401
Dear Lord, thank you so much.

1180
01:09:44,432 --> 01:09:46,412
For my mom and dad.

1181
01:09:46,434 --> 01:09:47,467
Thank you for their patience.

1182
01:09:47,468 --> 01:09:51,473
And everything
they've done for me.

1183
01:09:51,506 --> 01:09:55,643
I know that you know
what's best for our lives.

1184
01:09:55,644 --> 01:09:58,312
And I'm gonna
trust in you to guide,

1185
01:09:58,313 --> 01:10:01,549
my life from now on.

1186
01:10:01,550 --> 01:10:04,554
In Jesus name, amen.

1187
01:10:04,586 --> 01:10:05,486
Amen.

1188
01:10:05,487 --> 01:10:06,454
Amen.

1189
01:10:06,455 --> 01:10:11,235
Wow, what was that about?

1190
01:10:11,261 --> 01:10:15,505
I met with Pastor Shane
and I've decided

1191
01:10:15,632 --> 01:10:18,238
to live my life God's way.

1192
01:10:22,907 --> 01:10:26,787
I love you and I'm so happy.

1193
01:10:26,811 --> 01:10:29,553
I love you too, Mom.

1194
01:10:29,580 --> 01:10:32,715
And Dad, I know I've been

1195
01:10:32,716 --> 01:10:35,752
a real jerk lately
and I promise

1196
01:10:35,753 --> 01:10:37,562
I'm gonna change.

1197
01:10:40,358 --> 01:10:41,701
Proud of you, son.

1198
01:10:45,163 --> 01:10:45,596
Now, let's dig in.

1199
01:10:45,597 --> 01:10:46,473
Let's eat.

1200
01:10:46,498 --> 01:10:48,444
Let's eat, I'm starved.

1201
01:10:48,466 --> 01:10:49,308
Did you make an appointment.

1202
01:10:49,334 --> 01:10:51,235
To get your hair cut yet?

1203
01:10:51,236 --> 01:10:51,509
Not yet.

1204
01:10:51,536 --> 01:10:52,537
It is getting
a little long, isn't it?

1205
01:10:52,570 --> 01:10:54,205
Yeah.

1206
01:10:54,206 --> 01:10:55,407
It's not that bad.

1207
01:10:55,408 --> 01:10:57,475
Is everybody in
school like that?

1208
01:10:57,476 --> 01:10:58,343
It's a trend.

1209
01:10:58,344 --> 01:11:00,545
You wouldn't know
anything about it, Mom

1210
01:11:00,546 --> 01:11:01,547
hey, I'm pretty hip.

1211
01:11:01,581 --> 01:11:02,457
Come on.

1212
01:11:02,482 --> 01:11:03,517
Yeah.

1213
01:11:03,549 --> 01:11:04,584
You're not too bad.

1214
01:11:04,617 --> 01:11:06,187
Mm-hm.

1215
01:11:06,218 --> 01:11:07,458
Better than Dad anyway.

1216
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:22,802
Hey, Em, Jessica.

1217
01:11:22,803 --> 01:11:23,904
Hey Luke, what's up?

1218
01:11:23,905 --> 01:11:24,905
Hey Luke.

1219
01:11:24,906 --> 01:11:27,374
Oh, I just... just came
to get my paycheck.

1220
01:11:27,375 --> 01:11:28,683
What did you guys order?

1221
01:11:28,810 --> 01:11:30,756
Pizza.

1222
01:11:30,778 --> 01:11:33,782
Right.

1223
01:11:33,815 --> 01:11:35,852
I'm gonna go get some
crushed red peppers.

1224
01:11:35,883 --> 01:11:37,556
Need anything?

1225
01:11:41,290 --> 01:11:42,530
Mind if I sit down?

1226
01:11:42,558 --> 01:11:48,440
No, go ahead.

1227
01:11:48,464 --> 01:11:53,464
Listen, I'm really sorry.

1228
01:11:54,470 --> 01:11:57,406
I didn't mean
the things that I said.

1229
01:11:57,407 --> 01:12:00,445
I was an idiot.

1230
01:12:00,744 --> 01:12:03,879
Can you forgive me?

1231
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:07,549
You're not an idiot.

1232
01:12:07,550 --> 01:12:12,155
And I forgive you.

1233
01:12:12,156 --> 01:12:15,137
It means a lot, Em.

1234
01:12:15,159 --> 01:12:20,507
You know, you were right
about this God stuff.

1235
01:12:21,465 --> 01:12:24,868
I was lost after the accident.

1236
01:12:24,869 --> 01:12:30,183
And God gave me a peace,
you know what I mean?

1237
01:12:30,342 --> 01:12:34,654
Yeah, I know
exactly what you mean.

1238
01:12:35,113 --> 01:12:37,150
I owe it to you, Em.

1239
01:12:41,554 --> 01:12:43,534
Well, I have to get
to the surf shop.

1240
01:12:43,556 --> 01:12:47,436
Before it closes, so...

1241
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:49,528
Thanks a lot for talking.

1242
01:12:49,529 --> 01:12:52,669
Anytime.

1243
01:12:53,199 --> 01:12:56,043
See you soon?

1244
01:12:56,069 --> 01:12:58,204
Oh, totally.

1245
01:12:58,205 --> 01:13:00,907
Maybe we could catch
a movie sometime.

1246
01:13:00,908 --> 01:13:04,617
Yeah, that'd be great.

1247
01:13:04,645 --> 01:13:06,750
Awesome, all right
I'll see you guys.

1248
01:13:06,780 --> 01:13:09,056
Bye.

1249
01:13:09,616 --> 01:13:10,550
A movie.

1250
01:13:10,551 --> 01:13:12,725
Aww, so all is well?

1251
01:13:12,854 --> 01:13:13,855
Yeah.

1252
01:13:21,896 --> 01:13:22,840
Yeah, you know,
there's a little wave

1253
01:13:22,864 --> 01:13:23,997
out there right now for sure.

1254
01:13:23,998 --> 01:13:26,000
But it's kinda like me
wasting your time,

1255
01:13:26,001 --> 01:13:27,640
you know what I mean?

1256
01:13:27,670 --> 01:13:29,737
Yeah, a swell coming
though, for sure.

1257
01:13:29,738 --> 01:13:31,843
Okay.

1258
01:13:31,874 --> 01:13:34,912
Luke, little bro,
get over here.

1259
01:13:34,944 --> 01:13:36,753
Welcome to the family brother.

1260
01:13:36,779 --> 01:13:37,679
Huh?

1261
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:39,591
Yeah, Shane told me
all about it.

1262
01:13:39,615 --> 01:13:40,821
You're in the family now!

1263
01:13:40,850 --> 01:13:41,883
Pastor Shane?

1264
01:13:41,884 --> 01:13:44,024
Yeah, God's family, Lukey.

1265
01:13:44,554 --> 01:13:46,727
Oh, man, I 'am sorry.

1266
01:13:46,757 --> 01:13:48,862
I didn't know you
were Christian.

1267
01:13:48,892 --> 01:13:52,962
Ouch, I guess I should be
a better witness, eh?

1268
01:13:52,963 --> 01:13:54,597
Oh, no, no, no.

1269
01:13:54,598 --> 01:13:54,803
My bad.

1270
01:13:54,831 --> 01:13:57,701
Um, how do you know Shane?

1271
01:13:57,702 --> 01:13:58,976
Oh man, everyone knows Shane.

1272
01:13:59,003 --> 01:13:59,981
He's the first guy
from around here

1273
01:14:00,004 --> 01:14:01,779
to win a big contest.

1274
01:14:01,806 --> 01:14:02,806
Pastor Shane?

1275
01:14:02,807 --> 01:14:03,649
Yeah, man.

1276
01:14:03,674 --> 01:14:04,778
He would have
dominated the tour.

1277
01:14:04,809 --> 01:14:06,880
If it wasn't for his accident.

1278
01:14:06,911 --> 01:14:08,584
Wait, what accident?

1279
01:14:08,613 --> 01:14:10,580
Ah, it's been a while now.

1280
01:14:10,581 --> 01:14:12,720
Shane and Skip Smith,
another local guy.

1281
01:14:12,750 --> 01:14:14,819
Who was really rippin
it up around here.

1282
01:14:14,820 --> 01:14:17,596
They were headed up to
the Open in Huntington.

1283
01:14:17,623 --> 01:14:19,694
Drunk driver
cumin' the other way,

1284
01:14:19,725 --> 01:14:23,628
blasted over median
and landed right in Skip's car.

1285
01:14:23,629 --> 01:14:24,629
It was heavy.

1286
01:14:24,630 --> 01:14:26,803
Skip died and Shane
was in the hospital

1287
01:14:26,832 --> 01:14:29,701
for a long time.

1288
01:14:29,702 --> 01:14:31,773
He never surfed
a contest again.

1289
01:14:31,805 --> 01:14:33,005
That's insane.

1290
01:14:33,006 --> 01:14:34,952
I mean, I heard about that

1291
01:14:34,974 --> 01:14:38,717
but I had no idea it was
Pastor Shane.

1292
01:14:38,745 --> 01:14:40,554
Yeah, God has a way
of changing our direction

1293
01:14:40,580 --> 01:14:41,957
when He wants to.

1294
01:14:41,981 --> 01:14:43,859
You know, we think
we have it all figured out

1295
01:14:43,884 --> 01:14:47,559
and He's like,
"No, I need you over here."

1296
01:14:47,588 --> 01:14:47,987
You know?

1297
01:14:47,988 --> 01:14:49,558
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1298
01:14:49,590 --> 01:14:50,568
Well, that's crazy.

1299
01:14:50,591 --> 01:14:51,934
Yeah.

1300
01:14:51,959 --> 01:14:54,701
Oh, I'm here to pick up
my board though, so.

1301
01:14:54,728 --> 01:14:55,763
Which one?

1302
01:14:55,796 --> 01:14:56,797
Which one?

1303
01:14:56,830 --> 01:14:59,767
The one Patterson shaped,
the magic board.

1304
01:14:59,768 --> 01:15:02,009
Oh man, bad news, bro.

1305
01:15:02,570 --> 01:15:05,642
That thing's long gone.

1306
01:15:05,674 --> 01:15:06,907
No way, man.

1307
01:15:06,908 --> 01:15:07,750
Yeah.

1308
01:15:07,776 --> 01:15:09,722
Yeah, I wanted to use it
for the contest this weekend.

1309
01:15:09,744 --> 01:15:10,552
Yeah, I know.

1310
01:15:10,579 --> 01:15:12,820
I just sold it
the other day, though.

1311
01:15:12,847 --> 01:15:13,848
We still have some sweet boards

1312
01:15:13,849 --> 01:15:17,559
back there, though.

1313
01:15:17,587 --> 01:15:18,691
No, man.

1314
01:15:18,721 --> 01:15:21,565
I really wanted that one, so...

1315
01:15:21,590 --> 01:15:23,725
Sorry, bro.

1316
01:15:23,726 --> 01:15:24,893
All right.

1317
01:15:24,894 --> 01:15:26,896
Sorry, Luke.

1318
01:15:34,772 --> 01:15:35,978
What's up?

1319
01:15:36,006 --> 01:15:36,906
Hi.

1320
01:15:36,907 --> 01:15:38,608
Tomorrow's the day.

1321
01:15:38,609 --> 01:15:39,781
You surf in'?

1322
01:15:39,810 --> 01:15:40,720
Yeah, I'll be there.

1323
01:15:40,744 --> 01:15:41,950
Don't get your hopes up.

1324
01:15:42,312 --> 01:15:44,046
Funny.

1325
01:15:44,047 --> 01:15:46,149
One spat buddy, it's all mine.

1326
01:15:46,150 --> 01:15:51,896
Yeah, we'll see.

1327
01:15:51,923 --> 01:15:53,061
Hey.

1328
01:15:53,091 --> 01:15:55,128
Oh, hey.

1329
01:15:55,159 --> 01:15:58,902
What's up?

1330
01:15:58,930 --> 01:16:00,068
Same old, same old.

1331
01:16:00,098 --> 01:16:01,232
Yeah.

1332
01:16:01,233 --> 01:16:03,034
I'm on my way to math class.

1333
01:16:03,035 --> 01:16:04,235
Very exciting.

1334
01:16:04,236 --> 01:16:06,045
Yeah, I know what you mean.

1335
01:16:06,071 --> 01:16:06,378
Chemistry.

1336
01:16:06,905 --> 01:16:08,282
Oh, fun.

1337
01:16:08,307 --> 01:16:11,311
Um, so, I was wondering

1338
01:16:11,343 --> 01:16:14,112
what are you doing
tomorrow morning.

1339
01:16:14,113 --> 01:16:16,115
Like, early?

1340
01:16:16,116 --> 01:16:17,149
Okay, you're kind
of scaring me.

1341
01:16:17,150 --> 01:16:21,153
How early are
you talking about?

1342
01:16:21,154 --> 01:16:24,290
Well, I have a surf tryout
tomorrow morning at 7

1343
01:16:24,291 --> 01:16:27,170
at the Point.

1344
01:16:27,193 --> 01:16:30,037
Or is that too early for you?

1345
01:16:30,063 --> 01:16:34,000
Are you asking me to come?

1346
01:16:34,001 --> 01:16:35,912
Well, yeah.

1347
01:16:35,936 --> 01:16:40,073
I mean, we can
meet there if you want.

1348
01:16:40,074 --> 01:16:43,317
All right, I'll see you at 7.

1349
01:16:43,344 --> 01:16:45,119
Awesome.

1350
01:16:45,146 --> 01:16:45,988
Bye.

1351
01:16:46,013 --> 01:16:47,118
Bye.

1352
01:16:57,058 --> 01:16:58,264
Nice mornin'.

1353
01:16:58,293 --> 01:17:00,330
Mornin' Dad,
what are you doin' up?

1354
01:17:00,362 --> 01:17:01,363
Mornin' Luke.

1355
01:17:01,897 --> 01:17:02,998
Mom?

1356
01:17:02,999 --> 01:17:04,205
What are you guys up to?

1357
01:17:04,234 --> 01:17:05,100
Didn't think we'd let you go to

1358
01:17:05,101 --> 01:17:06,375
the tryouts
without us, did you?

1359
01:17:06,769 --> 01:17:07,770
Come on, I'll drive.

1360
01:17:07,804 --> 01:17:08,770
Okay.

1361
01:17:08,771 --> 01:17:09,943
You're not gone
need that, Luke.

1362
01:17:09,973 --> 01:17:13,978
Dad, I need my board.

1363
01:17:14,010 --> 01:17:15,811
No way.

1364
01:17:15,812 --> 01:17:16,984
Way.

1365
01:17:17,013 --> 01:17:18,114
You gotta be ki...
where did you...

1366
01:17:18,115 --> 01:17:19,116
how did you know?

1367
01:17:19,149 --> 01:17:20,183
Do you like it?

1368
01:17:20,184 --> 01:17:21,094
Are you kidding me?

1369
01:17:21,118 --> 01:17:23,098
It's perfect!

1370
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:25,855
It's... it's the magic board.

1371
01:17:25,856 --> 01:17:26,994
Well, it's a big tryout, right?

1372
01:17:27,024 --> 01:17:28,901
And you're gonna need
all the help you can get

1373
01:17:28,926 --> 01:17:32,840
and we just wanted to
do somethin' for ya.

1374
01:17:32,863 --> 01:17:33,897
We're real proud of ya.

1375
01:17:33,898 --> 01:17:35,933
You guys are the best.

1376
01:17:35,934 --> 01:17:36,934
I love you guys so much.

1377
01:17:36,935 --> 01:17:38,175
All right now,
we're gonna be late.

1378
01:17:38,203 --> 01:17:38,936
Let's go.

1379
01:17:38,937 --> 01:17:40,007
Come on.

1380
01:17:40,038 --> 01:17:42,075
Wait, wait, wait,
Dad, one second.

1381
01:18:11,939 --> 01:18:13,105
Well, how you feelin', son?

1382
01:18:13,106 --> 01:18:14,139
Ready to go?

1383
01:18:14,140 --> 01:18:16,916
Yeah, feeling good, Dad.

1384
01:18:23,051 --> 01:18:24,121
No way.

1385
01:18:24,152 --> 01:18:26,223
Dad, honk the horn.

1386
01:18:26,254 --> 01:18:28,155
Hey, who's that
with Pastor Shane?

1387
01:18:28,156 --> 01:18:30,123
That's Emily from church.

1388
01:18:30,124 --> 01:18:31,324
She actually came.

1389
01:18:31,325 --> 01:18:34,033
She's so cute.

1390
01:18:35,097 --> 01:18:36,371
Any last minute advice?

1391
01:18:36,699 --> 01:18:38,566
Nah, you're gonna do fine, man.

1392
01:18:38,567 --> 01:18:39,968
Get out there, do your best.

1393
01:18:39,969 --> 01:18:42,074
Trust God for the rest, all right?

1394
01:18:42,104 --> 01:18:44,345
- Go!
- Go, man, go!

1395
01:19:58,151 --> 01:19:59,926
And I was like,
"Where did he go?"

1396
01:19:59,953 --> 01:20:01,330
She's like,
"Oh, he went surfing

1397
01:20:01,355 --> 01:20:03,301
at the Jedi."

1398
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:05,825
I was like,
"Do you mean the jetty'?"

1399
01:20:05,826 --> 01:20:09,934
She's like,
"No, he definitely said the Jedi."

1400
01:20:10,265 --> 01:20:12,609
Yo, Lukey, how much, man?

1401
01:20:12,634 --> 01:20:14,272
$48.50.

1402
01:20:14,302 --> 01:20:15,576
Ouch.

1403
01:20:19,507 --> 01:20:20,679
Here you go.

1404
01:20:20,875 --> 01:20:22,287
- Thanks.
- Thanks, man.

1405
01:20:22,812 --> 01:20:25,780
Luke.

1406
01:20:25,781 --> 01:20:28,785
Grab a slice
and take a seat, my friend.

1407
01:20:33,255 --> 01:20:34,495
All right, guys,
let's get started.

1408
01:20:35,124 --> 01:20:36,102
But first off, let's welcome

1409
01:20:36,125 --> 01:20:38,194
the two new members
of our team.

1410
01:20:38,195 --> 01:20:41,870
Matt McCoy and Luke Harris.

1411
01:21:18,937 --> 01:21:21,038
So, what now?

1412
01:21:21,039 --> 01:21:22,746
I don't know.

1413
01:21:22,774 --> 01:21:24,543
A big contest comin'up soon.

1414
01:21:24,544 --> 01:21:26,490
See how it goes.

1415
01:21:26,513 --> 01:21:29,551
Just learning to trust God
more each day.

1416
01:21:33,086 --> 01:21:35,066
That's good.

1417
01:21:35,088 --> 01:21:37,898
I'm proud of you.

1418
01:21:37,924 --> 01:21:40,793
So, um, what about college?

1419
01:21:40,794 --> 01:21:43,104
Ugh...

1420
01:21:43,130 --> 01:21:46,942
I start at City in the fall.

1421
01:21:46,967 --> 01:21:48,947
Can't wait.

1422
01:21:48,969 --> 01:21:51,074
Hey, it'll be good for you.

1423
01:21:51,105 --> 01:21:54,775
Right, and what about you?

1424
01:21:54,776 --> 01:21:58,779
You all packed up
for the dorms back east?

1425
01:21:58,780 --> 01:22:02,483
Not quite.

1426
01:22:02,484 --> 01:22:05,226
What do you mean not quite?

1427
01:22:05,887 --> 01:22:10,132
Well, there might be
a slight change of plans.

1428
01:22:10,159 --> 01:22:11,103
Huh?

1429
01:22:11,727 --> 01:22:12,761
Do you know how much money

1430
01:22:12,762 --> 01:22:14,662
you can save getting
your lower division classes

1431
01:22:14,663 --> 01:22:19,200
out of the way at
a community college?

1432
01:22:19,201 --> 01:22:20,402
Hold on a sec.

1433
01:22:20,403 --> 01:22:22,470
Now, what are you saying?

1434
01:22:22,471 --> 01:22:24,773
Just saying that maybe
you'll be seeing me

1435
01:22:24,774 --> 01:22:26,652
around campus in the fall.

1436
01:22:26,677 --> 01:22:28,714
You're serious?

1437
01:22:28,745 --> 01:22:30,383
No way!

1438
01:22:30,413 --> 01:22:32,415
That's great.

1439
01:22:32,449 --> 01:22:36,625
Yeah, I think so, too.

1440
01:22:37,187 --> 01:22:41,792
Wow.

1441
01:22:41,793 --> 01:22:45,963
Well, maybe we can take
some classes together?

1442
01:22:45,964 --> 01:22:50,709
Maybe, if you're lucky.

1443
01:22:50,735 --> 01:22:52,803
If I'm lucky.

1444
01:22:52,804 --> 01:22:53,976
Get out of here.

1445
01:22:54,005 --> 01:22:56,919
No, no, no!
