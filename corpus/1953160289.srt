1
00:00:58,859 --> 00:00:59,985
Wait!

2
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:22,809
Are you looking at me?

3
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,814
Hey!

4
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:06,189
My hair!

5
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:07,853
Police!

6
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:09,418
Somebody help!

7
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:11,431
Wait, the bus!

8
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:33,044
You're late, Pecker.

9
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,206
Sorry, Mr. Bozak.

10
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:36,044
I was taking pictures.

11
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,551
Late is late no matter what.

12
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:40,246
Finish this order.

13
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:00,163
I'll be right there.

14
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:10,272
You got customers.

15
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:20,992
Here, Miss Emily.

16
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:22,927
Don't forget to come to my show.

17
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:31,301
Remember,
this ain't no art gallery.

18
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:32,805
It's a restaurant.

19
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:36,039
Your friends better
buy something tomorrow...

20
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:37,475
or I'll throw them out.

21
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,963
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Asshole.

22
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,938
Hope to see you tomorrow.

23
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:41,736
Bye.

24
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:53,849
Here you go, Pecker-man.
Special delivery.

25
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:55,218
Where'd you get this?

26
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:57,917
I got myself
a five-finger discount.

27
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:00,119
Dude, you're gonna get popped.

28
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,650
Not me, bro.

29
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,026
I'm invisible.

30
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:05,657
Ready to play?

31
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,826
Shopping for others!

32
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,212
Hey, you! Brats.

33
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:38,581
Next in line, please.

34
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,497
Would you hurry up, please?

35
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:51,731
This is not mine.

36
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:53,705
I don't care if it's not...

37
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,002
This is not mine.

38
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:59,542
I wouldn't eat these rice cakes.

39
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:00,910
What is this?

40
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:02,642
I didn't buy this.

41
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:05,985
There's nothing wrong
with my butt.

42
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:07,179
Watch your mouth.

43
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:09,885
I don't eat meat.

44
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:11,618
I'm a vegetarian.

45
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:15,491
I'll be right with you.
Hold on.

46
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:17,325
I'm sorry.

47
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:18,490
Void that receipt.

48
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:20,328
It's OK, ma'am.

49
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:25,563
Just a minute.

50
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:27,698
What's going on?

51
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:30,801
Some jerk
in the produce department.

52
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,107
Hey, you!

53
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:42,086
Stop, thief! Somebody help me.

54
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:44,283
You gonna pay for that?

55
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:16,281
Hi, Shelley.

56
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,360
I got fluff and fold duties.

57
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,919
Just a few pin-up shots.

58
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:29,696
You can't work every second
of your life.

59
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:33,103
But I don't have all day
for your stupid art.

60
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:35,334
I gotta refill
the change machines...

61
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,138
unpack the mini-soaps.

62
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:41,946
Beautiful.

63
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:45,974
How could I be beautiful
with all the dirt I put up with?

64
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,351
I don't know, but you sure are.

65
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:52,056
See him?

66
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,286
Ring around the collar.

67
00:09:57,497 --> 00:09:59,089
Chin up.

68
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:00,565
Lean into the light.

69
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:02,728
And her.

70
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:05,260
You wouldn't believe
the B.O. Stains on her blouses.

71
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:11,233
You're so sexy when you work.
You know that?

72
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:15,441
How can I be sexy when I know
that she has dingleberries?

73
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,448
She does?

74
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:20,077
Yes siree, Bob.

75
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:24,247
You're my Venus de Milo.
You know that?

76
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,782
You're crazy. You see art
when there's nothing there.

77
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,731
Hey, buddy, no sitting
on the washing machines.

78
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:39,871
You, no slamming doors
on the dryer.

79
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:41,874
Trying to make me deaf?

80
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:44,440
One more shot.

81
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,174
Oh, God,
it's a Pecker moment.

82
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:50,813
Oh, my God.

83
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:55,744
You can't dye your clothes here!

84
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:57,619
I don't have any fall colors.

85
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,717
Laundromats have rules.
Can't you read the sign?

86
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,991
Get out, and take your tired
wardrobe someplace else!

87
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:07,056
You're barred from
the Spin n' Grin Laundromat...

88
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,159
for the rest of your life!

89
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:23,748
Look.

90
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:26,274
I killed a worm.

91
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,019
I got you something.

92
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:31,421
Goody.

93
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:33,220
Let's say hi to Mom.

94
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:36,259
I don't know, Joyce.

95
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:39,993
Miss Betty, I think it looks
very fashionable.

96
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,660
The layered look
is in this year.

97
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,362
Hi, Mom.

98
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:44,597
Hey, Peck.

99
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:46,798
What do you think?

100
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:48,932
Looks cool.

101
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:52,467
I found a pair
of Calvin Klein underpants, too.

102
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:54,844
Good for you.

103
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,816
Outsider Al, Miss Betty,
get together.

104
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:58,976
Come on, Al.

105
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:00,110
Go on.

106
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:03,279
There's a good-looking couple.

107
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:05,154
Fresh!

108
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:08,456
Sir, everything on that rack
is half price.

109
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:11,793
Check the tag and divide by two.

110
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:13,924
Every day is a sale here.

111
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:19,235
You really know how to make
homeless people feel good...

112
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:20,603
about how they look.

113
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,905
Thanks, hon. We know how
to make a dollar holler...

114
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:25,706
here at the Bargain Hut.

115
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,679
You know what I always say.

116
00:12:27,714 --> 00:12:29,739
If you've got 15 cents
in your pocket...

117
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:33,445
I can make you look
like a million dollars.

118
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:35,113
I want more candy.

119
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:37,384
Little Chrissy,
you just had a candy bar.

120
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,948
Your teeth are gonna rot
out of your head.

121
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:42,621
I said I want candy!

122
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,098
Don't mind Miss Tooth Decay.

123
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:47,429
She's all sugared up.

124
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:49,526
Ain't that a beaut?

125
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:51,503
Twenty-five cents. Want a bag?

126
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:52,663
I'll wear it out.

127
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:55,196
Didn't I say the word ''candy''?

128
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:56,902
I loved the seventies, too.

129
00:12:56,943 --> 00:13:01,243
Somebody please
give me some candy!

130
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,181
Would you mind taking
Little Chrissy home for me?

131
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:06,549
She's been aggravating me
all day.

132
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:08,554
Sure, Mom.
Come on, Little Chrissy.

133
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:16,958
I thought you could use this
for your show.

134
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:20,858
Thanks. You rule.

135
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:55,695
This darn claw machine!

136
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:57,396
It's rigged!

137
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:00,864
You can't be a winner
every time, Guzzles.

138
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:02,875
Have a drink.

139
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:04,467
I'm broke, Jimmy.

140
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,377
Your damn claw machine
got all my money.

141
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:08,880
It's on me, old-timer.

142
00:14:08,915 --> 00:14:10,246
Thanks.

143
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,318
- Hey, Pecker.
- Hey, Dad.

144
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,377
Afternoon, Guzzles.

145
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:17,912
Hi, Chrissy. How you doing?

146
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:20,392
How's it going?

147
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:22,223
Always got
that broken-down camera...

148
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:23,660
his mama found
at the thrift shop.

149
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:30,058
How's my little
sweet tooth today?

150
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:31,900
Little Chrissy wants a Jolt.

151
00:14:31,938 --> 00:14:33,599
She does?

152
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:40,441
Slow day?

153
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,414
Slow's not the word.

154
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:44,609
I got a shot for you.

155
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:53,152
Put this in your show.

156
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:58,327
It's that damn Pelt Room.

157
00:14:58,364 --> 00:14:59,888
How am I supposed to compete...

158
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:02,025
with a stripper bar
across the street?

159
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:03,535
Lesbians, I hear.

160
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,366
Showing full bush.

161
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:08,373
B-E-A-V-E-R.

162
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,807
That's all men want
in a bar these days.

163
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:14,406
It says it here...

164
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:16,711
in the Board of Liquor License
rule book.

165
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:20,207
''Section 12-203, paragraph 3.

166
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,380
<i>''Pubic hair and liquor.''</i>

167
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,582
It's just plain illegal.

168
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,071
Let's have a big hand,
gentlemen...

169
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:49,547
for T-Bone the stripper!

170
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:55,352
She's all lesbian all the time!

171
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:57,117
That's why we're here!

172
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:59,886
What are you looking at,
assholes?

173
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:02,486
The nastiest girl in Baltimore!

174
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,496
Yeah, baby!

175
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,361
Take it off!

176
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,196
That's it! Come on!

177
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:09,826
I got it!

178
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:11,530
We show it all!

179
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:14,506
You like looking at lezzies,
don't you, suckers?

180
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,007
I love it!

181
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:17,873
Full frontal lesbian nudity!

182
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,435
You think men got
what women really need?

183
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,707
I got it!

184
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:26,749
Bush City!

185
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:27,946
You're wrong...

186
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:32,416
because this beef curtain
stands alone!

187
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,585
Hey, you little Peckerwood!

188
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:36,094
I was just looking!

189
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:38,892
There's no free peeking
in the Pelt Room.

190
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:40,922
I should tell your father!

191
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,432
One pit beef sandwich
with horseradish and ketchup.

192
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:51,943
I tell my lady friends...

193
00:16:51,978 --> 00:16:53,912
''Give a man
a pit beef sandwich...

194
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:56,414
<i>''and he'll be back for seconds.''</i>

195
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:58,474
Best pit beef in town.

196
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:01,384
There you go. Bottom round...
just the way you like it.

197
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,580
Four dollars.

198
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:04,985
Keep the change.

199
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,491
Thank you kindly.

200
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,992
I'll see you tomorrow.

201
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,939
I need to talk to you.

202
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:24,135
Hi, Memama. How's business?

203
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:25,768
All Baltimore
loves a pit beef sandwich.

204
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:27,039
Can I get a shot?

205
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,410
Sure can.

206
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:35,083
She's doing it again.

207
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:37,988
She is? When did she start?

208
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:39,889
Early this morning.

209
00:17:39,926 --> 00:17:43,726
Come in and take her picture
if you don't believe me.

210
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:44,923
Come on.

211
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:50,795
You open?

212
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:54,432
Hold your horses!

213
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:56,407
- I'm hungry!
- Be right back!

214
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:58,569
I want my pit beef!

215
00:17:58,611 --> 00:18:02,069
Sometimes there's things
more important than pit beef.

216
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:03,240
Come on.

217
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:06,342
She's been a regular
blabbermouth all day.

218
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:08,319
I can't wait.

219
00:18:08,354 --> 00:18:10,379
Wait till you hear her voice.

220
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,556
There she is.

221
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,235
Hi, Mary.

222
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,607
Full of grace!

223
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:33,407
See? She's talking.

224
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,038
It could be a real miracle.

225
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:36,309
A real miracle.

226
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:38,340
Full of grace.

227
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:39,749
You think so?

228
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,377
I do.

229
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:45,549
I was blinded by the blue
of Mary's cloak...

230
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:47,559
when I was just seven years old.

231
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:50,084
I been praying to her
ever since.

232
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,994
Sure has paid off, hasn't it?

233
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,157
It sure has.

234
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:55,030
Full of grace.

235
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:57,592
We hear you loud and clear.

236
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:00,867
You know what? Why don't
you two sit over there?

237
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:04,204
Perfect.

238
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:08,643
You two look like a holy card.

239
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:10,444
We do?

240
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:13,111
Wait till you see this picture.

241
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,346
Full of grace.

242
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:16,514
She likes you!

243
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:17,783
I like her, too.

244
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,849
Full of grace.

245
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,095
Honey, we're home!

246
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:29,363
Be right down!

247
00:19:29,402 --> 00:19:31,370
Is Memama up there with you?

248
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:33,372
We're taking pictures!

249
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:35,874
She's got customers!

250
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:37,876
Sweetie, come on. Give it back.

251
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,605
You have to wait
till after dinner.

252
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:41,875
But I'm hungry now!

253
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:45,680
Everything always looks good
through here.

254
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:49,251
Where are you going?

255
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:50,949
I'm making Sloppy Joes
for dinner.

256
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:53,254
I can't stay.

257
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:55,385
You've got to eat.

258
00:19:55,428 --> 00:19:57,555
Why do you think
we called him Pecker?

259
00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:59,393
Never did eat properly
as a child.

260
00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:00,763
Just pecked at his food.

261
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:03,064
I'm not hungry.

262
00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:05,093
Besides, I'm late for
my photo shoot with Tina.

263
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:07,901
We love your big sister...

264
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,908
but you know how we feel...

265
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:12,035
about that place
where she works.

266
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:13,443
The devil's workshop!

267
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:17,241
At least they don't
show pubic hair.

268
00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:18,910
That's one good thing.

269
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:21,419
Honey, don't say ''pubic''
in front of Little Chrissy.

270
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:23,422
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, sweetie.

271
00:20:23,456 --> 00:20:26,016
Please bring me a soda!

272
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,753
Bye, Dad.

273
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:29,624
Don't be too late.

274
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:47,278
Evening, Mr. Nellbox.

275
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:50,612
- How you doing, daisy bait?
- Good.

276
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:51,946
Still taking them pictures?

277
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:54,214
As long as it's OKwith you.

278
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,448
I told your sister Tina...

279
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:58,957
''Pecker ought to forget
about his stupid camera...

280
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:01,391
<i>''get on the bar and dance.''</i>

281
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,895
Show his bony ass,
make some real money.

282
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,898
Thanks, sir,
but I could never do that.

283
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,627
Can I take your picture, though?

284
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:11,397
Knock yourself out, buttplug.

285
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:12,734
Hold still.

286
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,001
I'll hold it
any way I can get it.

287
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:17,909
See you later.

288
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,274
Have a ball, kid.

289
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,415
Here you go, champ.

290
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,610
There you go.

291
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,349
Thanks. Another beer?

292
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:31,549
Another beer.

293
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:01,853
Let's hear it
for Larry the Lughead!

294
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:10,054
Larry's 21 years old...

295
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:13,258
heterosexual, uncut,
on probation...

296
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:15,290
and currently makes his living
as a burglar.

297
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:18,967
Come on, baby!

298
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:23,100
How about Seafood Sam
the Sailor Man?

299
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:33,080
He may be straight,
but he's on leave...

300
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:37,020
so don't ask, don't tell,
just get him to a hotel.

301
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,291
Thar she blows!

302
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,230
Bull's-eye!

303
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,296
Hey, Larry...

304
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:56,501
No teabagging.
You know the rules.

305
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:58,442
No balls on foreheads.

306
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:01,446
Teabagging is forbidden
here at the Fudge Palace.

307
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,606
I understand.

308
00:23:02,648 --> 00:23:04,878
You teabag a customer
one more time...

309
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:07,681
and Mr. Nellbox
will fire your ass.

310
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:14,555
You're gonna like this one.

311
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:17,027
Look at this.

312
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,590
Be careful.

313
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,164
If it wasn't for you,
Pecker-man...

314
00:23:23,202 --> 00:23:25,397
I'd never know
this shit existed.

315
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:26,904
''Teabagging''?

316
00:23:26,939 --> 00:23:29,669
Jesus. I thought
I had heard of everything.

317
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:32,677
Dude, have you ever heard of
giving someone a Dutch oven?

318
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:34,178
What's that?

319
00:23:34,213 --> 00:23:36,238
It's when you fart in bed...

320
00:23:36,282 --> 00:23:38,614
and quickly pull the covers
over your partner's head.

321
00:23:39,952 --> 00:23:42,614
I gotta try that sometime.

322
00:23:42,655 --> 00:23:44,418
Damn.

323
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:45,650
Look at her.

324
00:23:45,691 --> 00:23:46,953
She's scary.

325
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:49,517
I don't know.
I think she looks proud.

326
00:23:51,497 --> 00:23:54,466
Whatever it is,
it's a cool fucking picture.

327
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,468
You sure got the eye
for this stuff.

328
00:23:56,502 --> 00:23:57,901
It's weird.

329
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:00,905
Sometimes I'm amazed
they even turn out at all.

330
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:04,306
There's my girl.

331
00:24:04,343 --> 00:24:06,504
Shelley sure is something.

332
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,880
She ought to take off work
once in a while.

333
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:11,382
Have some fun.

334
00:24:11,417 --> 00:24:15,547
Work is fun, Matt, if you're
doing something you love.

335
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:17,384
I guess, but look at me.

336
00:24:17,423 --> 00:24:19,823
I'm the best thief in town,
and I can't even get laid.

337
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:24,927
You hear them footsteps?

338
00:24:26,098 --> 00:24:27,258
It's her.

339
00:24:28,267 --> 00:24:29,700
Quick. One more shot.

340
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,280
Little Chrissy.

341
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,552
Say, ''Sugar.''

342
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:58,426
Sugar.

343
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:01,963
I love you.

344
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:06,897
No matter what.

345
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:29,891
This one I like OK.

346
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:31,190
It's out of focus...

347
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,391
but it ain't depressing
like the others.

348
00:25:33,432 --> 00:25:35,627
Makes people
feel like buying something.

349
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,738
Can I help you?

350
00:25:39,772 --> 00:25:41,399
They aren't even in color.

351
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,238
You can't look at the pictures
without ordering something.

352
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:46,608
- I'll have a macaroni salad.
- Right.

353
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:50,346
Look.

354
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,907
- Hey, Mom.
- Hi, honey.

355
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:54,919
Here you are. Macaroni salad.

356
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:56,477
Can I get you something?

357
00:25:56,522 --> 00:25:59,491
Hi, Mr. Bozak.
That's all right.

358
00:25:59,525 --> 00:26:01,720
We're just here
to look at the art.

359
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:06,364
Little Chrissy
can't eat outside food in here.

360
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:09,128
And they have to buy something.

361
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,203
I'm sorry.

362
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,364
All right.

363
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,873
You can't have it.

364
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:17,205
Four medium Cokes then.

365
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:20,234
I want my Jujy Fruits!

366
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:23,373
We're not allowed outside food.

367
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,882
You're getting a Coke.

368
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:26,384
We're here to look at art.

369
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,680
Get the Cokes.

370
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:28,879
Honey, I said...

371
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:30,912
I want my Jujy Fruits!

372
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:33,891
You're going to have a Coke
in a minute!

373
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:37,259
Congratulations.

374
00:26:37,296 --> 00:26:38,763
Thanks.

375
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:40,389
Here you go, Little Chrissy.

376
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:43,128
Who's that in the picture?
Is that Little Chrissy?

377
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:45,898
That's one of my favorite ones,
too.

378
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:48,406
Sweetie, you are so talented.

379
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,240
If only you could concentrate on
pretty scenery or something...

380
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,904
instead of our boring lives...

381
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:56,039
you might make a real career
out of this.

382
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,875
Get back to work.

383
00:27:04,223 --> 00:27:06,191
That's me!

384
00:27:06,225 --> 00:27:09,058
It's a miracle
they don't take it down.

385
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:11,085
I know what you mean.

386
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:15,032
You believe these pictures?

387
00:27:15,067 --> 00:27:16,864
What in the...

388
00:27:17,903 --> 00:27:20,701
I can't figure out
what this one is...

389
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:22,104
but I kinda like it.

390
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:27,401
Those homos.

391
00:27:28,614 --> 00:27:31,913
Your pictures are glorious.

392
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:36,278
There's nothing gay about it.

393
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:42,393
I'm sorry I'm late...

394
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:44,395
but wait till you try
this new product.

395
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:46,897
It removes lipstick stains,
deodorant rings.

396
00:27:46,932 --> 00:27:49,560
Thanks, honey.
That's really sweet.

397
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:53,002
Can I take a short break?
It won't be long.

398
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:54,767
Come on. Please?

399
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:56,398
You're off the clock then.

400
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:58,909
Just for five minutes.
Come on.

401
00:27:58,944 --> 00:28:03,210
And you two, don't even think
about using the rest rooms.

402
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:09,151
Look. It's all you, Shelley.

403
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,848
Oh, my God.

404
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:12,754
You look so pretty.

405
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:15,225
You don't think I show too much?

406
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,558
That's why they call them
figure studies.

407
00:28:17,596 --> 00:28:19,860
What will my customers say?

408
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:21,866
They'll say you inspire me.

409
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,630
It's just me
in my stupid Laundromat.

410
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:26,228
What's the big deal?

411
00:28:27,573 --> 00:28:28,733
Excuse me.

412
00:28:28,774 --> 00:28:30,366
Are you Pecker?

413
00:28:30,409 --> 00:28:32,001
I am.

414
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:33,306
I'm Rorey.

415
00:28:33,345 --> 00:28:35,540
- We're his parents.
- Hi.

416
00:28:35,581 --> 00:28:38,914
I'm from New York City
where I have an art gallery.

417
00:28:38,951 --> 00:28:40,919
I'm here to meet
with the Baltimore Museum...

418
00:28:40,953 --> 00:28:42,215
and I saw your flyer.

419
00:28:42,254 --> 00:28:43,721
Your pictures are amazing.

420
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:45,655
They're the real thing.

421
00:28:45,691 --> 00:28:47,158
Thanks.

422
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:49,592
This is my girlfriend Shelley.

423
00:28:49,628 --> 00:28:51,892
I love your look.

424
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,090
Tell me about this one.

425
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:01,202
It's...

426
00:29:03,008 --> 00:29:04,498
It's kind of...

427
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,314
It's the pubic hair
of a stripper!

428
00:29:14,553 --> 00:29:16,350
That's it.

429
00:29:16,388 --> 00:29:18,356
This is a family restaurant,
and you're fired!

430
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,358
I should hope so.
That was disgusting.

431
00:29:20,392 --> 00:29:21,518
Fired?

432
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,721
What did I do?

433
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,128
Chrissy, don't eat that, honey!

434
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:27,324
Look, Chrissy...

435
00:29:27,366 --> 00:29:28,856
Hurry up! I gotta go!

436
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,299
Go!

437
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:32,235
Listen to Daddy.

438
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,898
You want to get rickets?

439
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,206
How much?

440
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:41,678
For my picture?

441
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:43,044
You wanna buy it?

442
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:44,946
Of course. It's great.

443
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,650
- Thirty dollars.
- Sold.

444
00:29:48,687 --> 00:29:51,884
Mom, Dad, I just sold a picture.

445
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:55,689
I'd also love to give you a show
in my New York gallery.

446
00:29:56,428 --> 00:29:57,895
There you go.

447
00:29:57,929 --> 00:29:59,556
Look.

448
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:25,923
There's another opening
down the street.

449
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:28,425
- At Pat Hearn's Gallery.
- Got good reviews.

450
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,155
Why don't we give it a chance?

451
00:30:30,195 --> 00:30:31,457
All right.

452
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,937
That's my little sister.

453
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:44,601
Some wine?

454
00:30:44,643 --> 00:30:46,110
May I?

455
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:47,304
Certainly.

456
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:48,676
Isn't she a doll?

457
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:52,777
Darling!

458
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:57,955
My God, you've gotta listen
to what they're saying.

459
00:30:57,989 --> 00:30:59,388
This is The Times.

460
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:00,482
<i>''A teenage Ouija...</i>

461
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,390
''who's paintbrush
is the broken-down camera...

462
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:04,395
<i>''he found
in his mom's thrift shop.''</i>

463
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:08,297
Lester Hallbrook never raves
about anybody's first show!

464
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:09,664
He's over there.

465
00:31:10,936 --> 00:31:12,870
Thanks a lot, sir!

466
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:14,633
You don't have to do that.

467
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:18,409
Look at this one.

468
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:19,933
I saw that book at the Strand.

469
00:31:19,978 --> 00:31:22,412
There's Venetia Keydash.
She's a writer for Art News.

470
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:24,244
I want to introduce you to her.

471
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:25,806
Your pictures are sublime, son.

472
00:31:25,851 --> 00:31:27,375
Thanks a lot, ma'am.

473
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:29,148
If I knew how
to make 'em any better...

474
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:31,519
they probably
wouldn't work at all.

475
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:44,335
You know what?
Excuse me a second.

476
00:31:48,974 --> 00:31:50,271
Isn't he gorgeous?

477
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:51,434
He is.

478
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:53,569
We don't have boys that cute
in New York.

479
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,948
You having fun, hon?

480
00:31:56,982 --> 00:31:58,449
How could I?

481
00:31:58,483 --> 00:32:00,383
These people
don't go to Laundromats.

482
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:02,079
They go to dry cleaners.

483
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:06,890
Here's who I wanna meet.

484
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,894
Shelley, this is one
of the biggest collectors...

485
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:12,396
of modern photography
in New York, Lynn Wentworth.

486
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:16,025
You are so sexy, young lady,
and you don't even know it.

487
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:19,027
Sometimes I know I look good.

488
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:21,095
You know, Shelley...

489
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:23,573
she runs a successful Laundromat
in Baltimore.

490
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:26,577
I know she does, and I bought
all 12 pictures of it.

491
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:27,771
You did?

492
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:35,410
One thousand, three hundred
dollars for one picture?

493
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:38,047
I really didn't do anything.

494
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:41,116
Here you go. Gypsy, right?

495
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:46,555
Honey, no.

496
00:32:46,598 --> 00:32:47,929
That's enough chocolate.

497
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,434
We're gonna have
a big fancy dinner soon.

498
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:52,997
You are rich!

499
00:32:55,607 --> 00:32:57,768
They really are
something special.

500
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:00,539
Pecker's like
a humane Diane Arbus.

501
00:33:00,579 --> 00:33:03,412
But with a wonderful
streak of kindness.

502
00:33:04,216 --> 00:33:05,877
I'll be right back.

503
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:07,407
Excuse-moi.

504
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:12,450
Hi, Mary.

505
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:13,855
That's me.

506
00:33:13,892 --> 00:33:15,223
I beg your pardon?

507
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,228
I work in a gay bar
in Baltimore.

508
00:33:17,262 --> 00:33:19,093
We call everybody ''Mary.''

509
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:24,197
You got a little sugar in you,
don't you? Sure. I can tell.

510
00:33:24,236 --> 00:33:26,295
A little light in the loafer.

511
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:28,397
I don't mean nothing.
I love fags.

512
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,807
I'm Jed Coleman,
curator at the Whitney.

513
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,743
This is Lester Hallbrook
of The Times.

514
00:33:35,714 --> 00:33:37,909
Your brother is a very
talented individual.

515
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:40,110
You got that, Mary.

516
00:33:42,454 --> 00:33:45,890
I can't believe
you want my autograph.

517
00:33:45,924 --> 00:33:47,414
I don't know.

518
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:48,949
There you go.

519
00:33:48,994 --> 00:33:50,461
It looks so fun.

520
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:52,759
- Let's do it at Balducci's.
- Where's that at?

521
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:54,765
Wouldn't they just die
at Dean & Deluca's?

522
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,926
Is that a store?

523
00:33:56,968 --> 00:33:58,094
Gourmet anarchy.

524
00:33:58,136 --> 00:33:59,899
You can steal for me any day.

525
00:33:59,938 --> 00:34:01,997
Do you get aroused
when you shoplift?

526
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:05,877
I guess so.

527
00:34:05,911 --> 00:34:08,345
Would you girls like
to get together later?

528
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:12,382
I'd like to introduce you
to Redd Larchmont.

529
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:13,577
Redd!

530
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,889
This is Pecker...
and Shelley, who's so lucky.

531
00:34:17,923 --> 00:34:21,154
<i>Pecker, darling, I must have
''Little Chrissy's Sugar Fix.''</i>

532
00:34:23,328 --> 00:34:25,796
The whole edition
of that one's gone.

533
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:27,354
<i>Look at ''Rats Make Love.''</i>

534
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:28,923
It's one of my favorites.

535
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:33,031
There's Cindy.

536
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,096
Who?

537
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:37,108
Cindy Sherman...
the famous photographer?

538
00:34:37,142 --> 00:34:38,609
Right.

539
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:42,010
Hey, Cindy!
Thank you for coming to my show!

540
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:49,411
- Hi, Jed. How are you?
- Very nice.

541
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:50,682
Coming through.

542
00:34:50,722 --> 00:34:51,916
Excuse me!

543
00:34:51,957 --> 00:34:54,425
Ladies and gentlemen,
here she is!

544
00:34:54,459 --> 00:34:56,427
Full of grace.

545
00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:57,587
That's right.

546
00:34:57,629 --> 00:35:01,895
Our Lady herself, Mary...
right here in New York City.

547
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,868
I promise you it'll be OK.

548
00:35:04,903 --> 00:35:06,700
Seriously. I'm Pecker's mother.

549
00:35:06,738 --> 00:35:07,966
It's fine.

550
00:35:08,006 --> 00:35:09,166
Honey. Hi.

551
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:12,574
Here. Hold my purse
and watch Little Chrissy for me.

552
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:17,108
Be right back.

553
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:20,247
You got spare change?

554
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:21,411
Spare change?

555
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:24,980
You poor thing.
You must be so hungry. Here.

556
00:35:25,023 --> 00:35:27,253
Thank you.
Can I have your jacket?

557
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:28,884
Sure.

558
00:35:28,927 --> 00:35:30,827
Certainly you can.

559
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:33,330
There you go.

560
00:35:33,365 --> 00:35:36,425
Don't they have good
thrift stores in New York?

561
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:37,901
No, ma'am.

562
00:35:37,936 --> 00:35:39,403
They're so expensive.

563
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:44,067
Where I come from, you can get
an Easter outfit for 25 cents.

564
00:35:44,109 --> 00:35:45,872
You can?

565
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:48,777
Fuckin' lousy art galleries
are ruining this neighborhood!

566
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:51,782
Stupid blank paintings
and out-of-focus pictures...

567
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:54,046
and those ugly ass sculptures!

568
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:56,918
Sir, I understand.

569
00:35:56,955 --> 00:35:59,185
I know.
It's really hard, isn't it?

570
00:35:59,224 --> 00:36:01,454
It's hard to appreciate
new things...

571
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:04,360
if you don't have
the proper outfit to wear.

572
00:36:04,396 --> 00:36:06,591
Take this. Accessorize.

573
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:08,826
Tie it around your neck.

574
00:36:08,867 --> 00:36:10,926
Don't be afraid of fashion.

575
00:36:12,404 --> 00:36:14,065
That looks wonderful.

576
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:16,369
It's a whole new you.

577
00:36:16,408 --> 00:36:17,875
Listen up.

578
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:20,878
They're having
this artist's dinner...

579
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:22,880
<i>at this place
called the ''B'' Bar...</i>

580
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:24,541
after my son's opening.

581
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:26,049
You all should come.

582
00:36:26,084 --> 00:36:29,645
Free food, and who knows,
maybe you'll get a new outfit.

583
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:48,064
Excuse me, Lynn.

584
00:36:48,106 --> 00:36:50,904
Shelley,
you're right next to Pecker.

585
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:52,170
See you later.

586
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:56,106
I was wondering where you were.

587
00:36:57,782 --> 00:37:00,478
Do you believe this?
We're in a nightclub.

588
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,877
Is this your first time
in New York?

589
00:37:03,922 --> 00:37:06,186
You bet.
Is all this free?

590
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,851
The depth and maturity
of his work.

591
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,120
It's fantastic.

592
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,321
There's Bryce.

593
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:12,954
Hi, Collin. Hi, Pat.

594
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:15,864
Be careful of that guy
over there.

595
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,527
He's from Coagulum.
It's a magazine.

596
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:21,633
You're so good.

597
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:25,375
- Here you are, ma'am.
- How fancy.

598
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:26,900
For you, miss.

599
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:32,383
Don't be frightened.

600
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:33,850
These are just vegetables.

601
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:36,242
They won't hurt you.

602
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:39,883
I'd like to propose a toast.

603
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,688
To Pecker:
A brilliant photographer...

604
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:46,219
a sweet boy,
and a brand-new art star.

605
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,526
To Pecker.

606
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:49,157
To Pecker!

607
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:55,766
You have to stand up.

608
00:37:55,807 --> 00:37:57,468
These people are here for you.

609
00:37:57,509 --> 00:37:59,306
- Speak.
- Oh, God.

610
00:37:59,344 --> 00:38:00,402
It's your night.

611
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:02,913
I shouldn't have taken off work.

612
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:06,007
I should be at home
in my Laundromat doing my job.

613
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,381
I'm sure it'll be OK.

614
00:38:11,556 --> 00:38:14,354
Thank you all
for being so nice to me...

615
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:16,360
and buying my photographs.

616
00:38:17,428 --> 00:38:20,556
I wanna thank Rorey
for liking my pictures...

617
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:23,089
even though some
are out of focus...

618
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,932
and sometimes I don't
get the exposure right.

619
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,870
You don't know
what my customers are like.

620
00:38:27,906 --> 00:38:31,364
They wait for me to leave town
so they can defy my rules.

621
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:32,876
You're just imagining things.

622
00:38:32,911 --> 00:38:34,037
I'm not.

623
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:37,411
People with their dirty laundry
can be animals.

624
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:41,043
I'd like to toast my dad
for teaching me how far to go.

625
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:42,552
Take a bow.

626
00:38:42,587 --> 00:38:44,384
He's a great guy, isn't he?

627
00:38:44,422 --> 00:38:47,880
Is it legal to show pubic hair
in New York?

628
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:49,291
I'm not really sure.

629
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,295
And my grandmother...

630
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,126
for teaching me
to believe in myself...

631
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,961
no matter what anybody said.

632
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,024
She's a real saint.

633
00:38:57,068 --> 00:38:59,127
Full of grace.

634
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,229
My customers will do anything
if I'm not there.

635
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:03,832
They could be pissing
in my dryers as we speak!

636
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:06,469
It's going to be OK.

637
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:09,036
And my big sister Tina...

638
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:12,846
for helping me to understand
all types of human behavior.

639
00:39:12,884 --> 00:39:17,321
Come down to Baltimore,
the trade capital of the world!

640
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,482
Thanks, Tina.

641
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:21,617
And my little sister Chrissy...

642
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:23,559
Want a Valium, honey?

643
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:29,460
For teaching me life is nothing
if you're not obsessed.

644
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,730
Honey, you're flinging.

645
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:36,536
And Matt, the best assistant
a photographer could ever have.

646
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:38,906
Without him,
I couldn't even do my work.

647
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:40,433
He's a big help.

648
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:49,017
And my mom, for helping me
pick out my outfits.

649
00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:53,883
Actually, she helps us all
pick out our clothes.

650
00:39:53,925 --> 00:39:55,893
You look beautiful, Mom.

651
00:39:55,927 --> 00:39:57,326
Give her a hand!

652
00:39:57,362 --> 00:39:58,795
Can I have your blouse?

653
00:40:01,032 --> 00:40:04,627
This is a private dinner.

654
00:40:04,669 --> 00:40:06,136
We're on the list.

655
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:08,001
You're gonna have to leave.

656
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:09,734
They're sort of with me.

657
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:13,301
You said
we could get new clothes!

658
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:15,005
Do you know these people?

659
00:40:15,046 --> 00:40:16,513
I didn't know.

660
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:18,913
I thought someone
could help them.

661
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:20,918
It's OK.

662
00:40:20,952 --> 00:40:23,182
Everything's different
in New York, right?

663
00:40:23,221 --> 00:40:24,916
I shouldn't even be in New York.

664
00:40:24,956 --> 00:40:28,790
I'm a Baltimore girl,
and that's where I should stay.

665
00:40:28,826 --> 00:40:30,760
And most importantly,
to my girlfriend Shelley.

666
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:34,629
To Shelley, the real reason
I take pictures at all.

667
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:36,861
To Shelley!

668
00:41:31,723 --> 00:41:33,782
Honey, what does this mean?

669
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:36,919
''... Pecker's
delicious photographs...

670
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:40,590
<i>''of his culturally
challenged family.''</i>

671
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:41,928
<i>''Culturally challenged''?</i>

672
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:43,934
I don't like the sound of that.

673
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:45,799
That's just art nonsense.

674
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:49,936
That's me in the paper.

675
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:51,441
Are you homosexual?

676
00:41:51,476 --> 00:41:52,943
I'm not.

677
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:54,968
You wouldn't understand then.

678
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:58,949
Do you think this stuff is OK?

679
00:41:58,983 --> 00:42:00,917
Sure.

680
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:03,887
This is a big article.

681
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:05,411
<i>''A stain goddess''?</i>

682
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:09,256
The Village Voice called me
a stain goddess.

683
00:42:09,293 --> 00:42:11,784
I just means you look good.

684
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:15,287
Hey, what are you doing later?

685
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:24,508
Maybe I'll be
in the Catholic Review.

686
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:28,137
You're gonna be a holy day
of obligation, Mom.

687
00:42:28,179 --> 00:42:29,578
Here's the part I like.

688
00:42:29,614 --> 00:42:32,082
''Over 62 of Pecker's
edition prints...

689
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:36,519
<i>''were sold for prices

690
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:38,818
They have that in the paper?

691
00:42:43,961 --> 00:42:45,895
It's our stop.

692
00:42:58,976 --> 00:43:00,375
Oh, my God.

693
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:01,537
Mom, Dad.

694
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,171
What?

695
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,380
They've seen your pictures.

696
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:09,386
I'm out of here.
See you later.

697
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,910
Let's check it out.

698
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,887
Hold it, buddy.

699
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:16,223
Officer, it's our house.

700
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,557
Have we been robbed?

701
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:18,892
I'm afraid so.

702
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:20,898
But don't worry.
They're long gone.

703
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:22,399
Did they get my hot rollers?

704
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,594
I hear you're rich.

705
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,134
TV is gone.

706
00:43:30,174 --> 00:43:31,835
So is the VCR.

707
00:43:31,876 --> 00:43:33,002
I'll check upstairs.

708
00:43:33,044 --> 00:43:34,909
How about the kitchen?

709
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:36,914
Nobody's hurt.
That's what's important.

710
00:43:36,948 --> 00:43:38,916
See what happens
when you leave Baltimore?

711
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:41,418
Thank God Mary was with me.

712
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:42,942
Oh, God. My darkroom.

713
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:48,158
My Liza Minnelli CDs are gone!

714
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:51,753
They ate the cookies, too!

715
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:53,923
The negatives,
they're all here.

716
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:55,432
So are the prints.

717
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:58,128
They didn't even want my stuff.

718
00:44:00,404 --> 00:44:03,373
They took the clock-radio
and your electric shaver.

719
00:44:03,407 --> 00:44:05,398
I wonder if they were cute.

720
00:44:07,245 --> 00:44:09,839
Sweetie,
did they take your cookies?

721
00:44:09,881 --> 00:44:13,510
It's no wonder we were robbed
with that Pelt Room nearby.

722
00:44:13,551 --> 00:44:15,576
Pubic hair causes crime.

723
00:44:20,925 --> 00:44:22,085
Full of grace.

724
00:44:26,264 --> 00:44:27,390
It's OK.

725
00:44:27,431 --> 00:44:29,194
I hate vitamins!

726
00:44:30,735 --> 00:44:32,396
It's Rorey. Is Pecker there?

727
00:44:32,436 --> 00:44:33,903
I have fabulous news.

728
00:44:33,938 --> 00:44:35,337
Hold on.

729
00:44:36,941 --> 00:44:38,909
Phone's for you!

730
00:44:38,943 --> 00:44:40,911
We were just robbed.

731
00:44:40,945 --> 00:44:42,572
What do you mean?

732
00:44:42,613 --> 00:44:44,046
Burglarized?

733
00:44:46,717 --> 00:44:47,877
It's Rorey.

734
00:44:49,287 --> 00:44:51,983
Take pictures.
This could be your next show.

735
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:53,991
Your mom's loss,
your dad's sadness.

736
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:55,287
Get close-ups.

737
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,927
I didn't even think
to take pictures.

738
00:44:58,963 --> 00:45:00,089
Pictures?

739
00:45:00,131 --> 00:45:01,257
Guess what?

740
00:45:01,299 --> 00:45:04,359
<i>The Whitney Museum wants to
schedule ''A Peek At Pecker''...</i>

741
00:45:04,402 --> 00:45:05,869
in their upcoming schedule.

742
00:45:05,903 --> 00:45:08,895
The Whitney Museum!

743
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:12,208
Pecker's off work.

744
00:45:12,243 --> 00:45:14,234
Call back during business hours.

745
00:45:15,746 --> 00:45:17,941
This is all my fault.

746
00:45:17,982 --> 00:45:20,348
What they call art in New York,
young man...

747
00:45:21,586 --> 00:45:24,077
Iooks like plain misery to me.

748
00:45:25,656 --> 00:45:27,590
Don't become an asshole.

749
00:45:27,625 --> 00:45:30,025
I beg of you.
Don't become an asshole.

750
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:42,866
I don't understand this.

751
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:45,137
<i>''The haunting image
of financial despair.''</i>

752
00:45:45,176 --> 00:45:47,508
I was kidding around
with Pecker.

753
00:45:47,545 --> 00:45:49,103
I've still got customers.

754
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:51,114
We still have food on the table.
Right?

755
00:45:51,148 --> 00:45:53,514
Captain Crunch!

756
00:45:53,551 --> 00:45:55,678
Don't!

757
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:57,688
My hair's a mess.

758
00:45:57,722 --> 00:45:59,986
You look the same as always.

759
00:46:01,559 --> 00:46:03,686
It's awfully early, isn't it?

760
00:46:03,728 --> 00:46:04,888
I got it.

761
00:46:18,342 --> 00:46:19,502
Thank you.

762
00:46:22,346 --> 00:46:25,213
Rorey... She's always in a hurry.

763
00:46:25,249 --> 00:46:27,376
I was on MTV.

764
00:46:27,418 --> 00:46:29,545
What?

765
00:46:29,587 --> 00:46:32,647
I was talking to Larry
the Lughead on the phone...

766
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:35,523
and he saw Pecker's picture
of me on MTV.

767
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:40,187
Oh, Mary, I'm a model.

768
00:46:40,231 --> 00:46:43,894
''Mary'' is not
a homosexual term.

769
00:46:43,934 --> 00:46:47,028
Oh, my God! The cover!

770
00:46:47,071 --> 00:46:49,198
Memama?

771
00:46:50,408 --> 00:46:52,137
Oh, my God in heaven.

772
00:46:52,176 --> 00:46:53,939
We're all famous.

773
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:56,173
Just like the Jackson family.

774
00:46:56,213 --> 00:46:57,908
Don't say that.

775
00:46:57,948 --> 00:47:01,509
I'm gonna show it to Monsignor.

776
00:47:01,552 --> 00:47:03,918
I'd wait. I really would.

777
00:47:03,954 --> 00:47:07,651
Some Catholics
might not understand it.

778
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:13,029
I'll get it.

779
00:47:13,064 --> 00:47:14,258
Move over, Kate.

780
00:47:14,298 --> 00:47:16,493
Outta my way, RuPaul.

781
00:47:16,534 --> 00:47:18,434
See who it is first!

782
00:47:18,469 --> 00:47:20,960
Her comes Tina, supermodel!

783
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:26,241
Ciao, ciao, ciao!

784
00:47:28,479 --> 00:47:30,709
I'm Dr. Deborah Klompas.

785
00:47:30,748 --> 00:47:34,411
I'm an M.D. With Baltimore
City Child Protection Services.

786
00:47:34,452 --> 00:47:37,046
And you're Little Chrissy.

787
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:40,887
How may we help you?

788
00:47:40,925 --> 00:47:44,417
It's more about how I'm
gonna be able to help you.

789
00:47:44,462 --> 00:47:47,363
We don't need anybody's help,
lady.

790
00:47:47,398 --> 00:47:49,923
Protection Services
saw Little Chrissy...

791
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:51,901
in the Sun papers.

792
00:47:51,936 --> 00:47:54,029
There's nothing wrong
with Little Chrissy.

793
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:55,538
Little Chrissy's wired.

794
00:47:55,573 --> 00:47:57,336
She's just
a sugar-sensitive child.

795
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:58,671
That's all.

796
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:00,768
She does fidget.

797
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:03,573
I'll get it.

798
00:48:08,052 --> 00:48:09,349
More good news.

799
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:12,219
Hold on. We're in the middle
of a family crisis.

800
00:48:12,256 --> 00:48:14,656
I am sorry to inform you...

801
00:48:14,692 --> 00:48:19,254
but your child has attention-
deficit hyperactivity disorder.

802
00:48:19,296 --> 00:48:23,494
She needs Ritalin.

803
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:30,607
This is important.

804
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:33,474
<i>Vogue wants to do a shoot
called ''Slumming With Pecker.''</i>

805
00:48:33,511 --> 00:48:35,240
You have to hold on.

806
00:48:38,783 --> 00:48:40,216
Greg Gorman is the photographer.

807
00:48:40,251 --> 00:48:43,277
He shoots all the celebrities,
and he wants you to model.

808
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,548
I can't talk now.

809
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:46,419
I'll call you back.

810
00:48:46,457 --> 00:48:48,925
She does climb excessively.

811
00:48:48,959 --> 00:48:51,723
Would she eat better?

812
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:56,392
You think of these as Mother
and Daddy's little helpers.

813
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:59,869
Dad, all kids love candy,
though.

814
00:48:59,904 --> 00:49:01,201
It's for her health.

815
00:49:02,573 --> 00:49:05,667
Go ahead and take
your medication.

816
00:49:06,977 --> 00:49:09,411
Come on, Little Chrissy,
give me a pose.

817
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:27,787
What do you think you're doin'?

818
00:49:27,832 --> 00:49:30,266
You remember me
from the thrift shop?

819
00:49:32,269 --> 00:49:33,736
Wait a minute.

820
00:49:33,771 --> 00:49:35,830
That's my dad's radio.

821
00:49:35,873 --> 00:49:37,340
You robbed our house.

822
00:49:37,374 --> 00:49:39,706
So? You took my photograph
and didn't pay me.

823
00:49:39,743 --> 00:49:42,177
Come on, man.
That's not the same thing.

824
00:49:42,213 --> 00:49:43,510
These are real-life shots.

825
00:49:43,547 --> 00:49:46,380
Fuck you. It's my life,
real or not, asshole.

826
00:49:46,417 --> 00:49:47,782
We're even now.

827
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:51,049
Wait a minute!
My sister wants her CDs back!

828
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:54,180
No cops this time, right?

829
00:49:54,225 --> 00:49:55,692
Don't worry about them.

830
00:49:55,726 --> 00:49:57,091
They couldn't catch
a goddamn cold.

831
00:49:57,127 --> 00:49:58,560
Your pictures are everywhere.

832
00:49:58,596 --> 00:50:00,086
Tell me about it.

833
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:03,156
I'm trying to get new stuff,
but everyone knows me now.

834
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,498
I know. No doubt.

835
00:50:09,607 --> 00:50:10,801
Here.

836
00:50:14,211 --> 00:50:17,112
Don't even try it.

837
00:50:17,147 --> 00:50:19,138
That's my private garbage.

838
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:22,050
Sorry. No hard feelings, I hope.

839
00:50:22,086 --> 00:50:23,951
Get a real job.

840
00:50:23,988 --> 00:50:26,548
You stole from charity.

841
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:28,080
I'm callin' Jerry Lewis.

842
00:50:33,297 --> 00:50:36,289
I didn't sign no model release,
and I'm gonna sue your ass.

843
00:50:36,333 --> 00:50:38,062
He didn't even get paid yet.

844
00:50:38,102 --> 00:50:40,502
What would you know, fartmouth?

845
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:42,835
The gallery gets half his money.

846
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:45,467
You can suck my fat ass, Matt.

847
00:50:45,509 --> 00:50:48,501
Do you think
I should move to New York?

848
00:50:57,621 --> 00:50:58,849
Can I help you?

849
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:00,914
I think we're just looking.

850
00:51:10,834 --> 00:51:12,927
Do you have any Guess jeans?

851
00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:14,870
This ain't GQ, buddy.

852
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:17,772
We got real clothes
at regular prices.

853
00:51:17,808 --> 00:51:19,935
Just trying to look my best.

854
00:51:21,378 --> 00:51:22,743
How about Jordache?

855
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:24,270
I just told you.

856
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:44,965
Any Kathie Lee?

857
00:51:45,002 --> 00:51:46,492
Sold out.

858
00:51:54,878 --> 00:51:57,779
I'd like to fill out
a job application.

859
00:51:57,815 --> 00:52:00,215
I knew it was you, stupid.

860
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:02,377
And you're Peckerhead, right?

861
00:52:02,419 --> 00:52:03,579
Pecker, ma'am.

862
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:06,350
I saw those pictures, dumbbells!

863
00:52:08,359 --> 00:52:09,826
You're both caught.

864
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:11,794
I was gonna put it back, honest.

865
00:52:11,829 --> 00:52:13,456
We did it for the art.

866
00:52:13,497 --> 00:52:15,488
Art-schmart.
Give me that camera.

867
00:52:15,532 --> 00:52:18,990
Give me that camera,
or I'm callin' the cops.

868
00:52:20,704 --> 00:52:23,002
OK, you two. Whip it out.

869
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,302
What?

870
00:52:24,341 --> 00:52:28,038
I said take out your units.

871
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:33,115
Look, we're sorry.

872
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:36,142
I said unzip!

873
00:52:43,394 --> 00:52:46,363
That's what I call
a Peckerprint.

874
00:52:46,397 --> 00:52:48,297
Smile.

875
00:52:48,332 --> 00:52:50,300
You're on Candid Camera.

876
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:56,029
I've never been caught
shoplifting in my life.

877
00:52:56,073 --> 00:52:58,166
Maybe this will
teach you both...

878
00:52:58,208 --> 00:53:00,699
that some people
don't feel like being art.

879
00:53:00,744 --> 00:53:04,009
If I can't steal,
I don't want to be famous.

880
00:53:04,048 --> 00:53:05,242
I quit.

881
00:53:05,282 --> 00:53:08,615
We're sorry. Matt's a thief,
but he's a nice person.

882
00:53:11,422 --> 00:53:14,391
Is this the stain goddess
I heard about on Howard Stern?

883
00:53:14,425 --> 00:53:16,188
How do I get rid
of Pecker-tracks?

884
00:53:16,226 --> 00:53:17,693
Eat one, asswipe.

885
00:53:17,728 --> 00:53:20,788
Be a good little girl and put
your vagina to the phone.

886
00:53:20,831 --> 00:53:22,560
Shove it, fuckwad.

887
00:53:29,773 --> 00:53:32,207
Stop taking my picture!

888
00:53:32,242 --> 00:53:33,732
You're ruining my life!

889
00:53:33,777 --> 00:53:36,837
I'm sorry. I thought
I was making your life better.

890
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,815
Want to take my picture?

891
00:53:41,285 --> 00:53:42,718
You can't do that in here.

892
00:53:42,753 --> 00:53:45,244
Go to New York.
They love that stuff.

893
00:53:45,289 --> 00:53:47,348
Take my picture. Please?

894
00:53:53,197 --> 00:53:54,494
Don't you dare.

895
00:53:54,531 --> 00:53:56,829
Come on!
Before my quarters run out!

896
00:53:57,734 --> 00:53:59,201
Spin n' Grin.

897
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:00,362
It's me.

898
00:54:00,404 --> 00:54:02,372
I sold three prints
of you today.

899
00:54:02,406 --> 00:54:03,873
Is Pecker there?

900
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:05,067
Another obscene call.

901
00:54:05,109 --> 00:54:07,134
It's your girlfriend, asshole.

902
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:11,707
Can I work in peace?

903
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:14,717
Hi, honey. It's me, Rorey.

904
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:16,412
Did you get my little present?

905
00:54:51,355 --> 00:54:53,721
If this is Pecker,
don't call back.

906
00:55:04,902 --> 00:55:06,267
Spin n' Grin.

907
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:07,770
It's me, Peck.

908
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:09,795
A dryer overheated,
and some idiot flashed me.

909
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,967
Call Rorey.
Maybe she feels like talking.

910
00:55:28,225 --> 00:55:29,920
Could you get that door?

911
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:40,561
Are you sure this outfit is...
the way it's supposed to be?

912
00:55:40,604 --> 00:55:42,504
- Looks great.
- Turn this way.

913
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:44,666
Let's see the Polaroid.

914
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:46,335
Stop mauling me! Get off!

915
00:55:46,376 --> 00:55:47,502
Background ready?

916
00:55:47,544 --> 00:55:49,341
Five minutes.

917
00:55:49,379 --> 00:55:50,505
Hold still.

918
00:55:50,547 --> 00:55:53,311
I'd never wear this ugly rag.

919
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:54,908
It's comme des garcons, darling.

920
00:55:54,952 --> 00:55:56,783
You should be so lucky.

921
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:57,980
Close your eyes.

922
00:55:58,021 --> 00:55:59,283
Don't tell me about fashion.

923
00:55:59,323 --> 00:56:02,520
Mr. Gorman, I'm not so sure...

924
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:05,824
Pecker is so comfortable
about modeling today.

925
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:07,454
But your son's
a fashion natural.

926
00:56:07,497 --> 00:56:09,158
He's going to look great.

927
00:56:10,133 --> 00:56:12,601
Can I see?

928
00:56:12,636 --> 00:56:13,967
Shake your head, darling.

929
00:56:17,608 --> 00:56:19,371
I look like a simpleton.

930
00:56:19,409 --> 00:56:23,072
You with the rash, put this on.

931
00:56:23,113 --> 00:56:25,047
My scalp itches.

932
00:56:27,584 --> 00:56:29,518
Look at Mommy.

933
00:56:29,553 --> 00:56:32,681
Honey, look at Mommy.

934
00:56:34,591 --> 00:56:37,617
What? Oh, sweetie, is it time
for your medication?

935
00:56:37,661 --> 00:56:39,629
Here we go.

936
00:56:39,663 --> 00:56:41,756
I don't know about these pills.

937
00:56:41,798 --> 00:56:44,266
Here. There you go, sweetie.

938
00:56:44,301 --> 00:56:45,825
Wash it down.

939
00:56:46,603 --> 00:56:48,070
You don't want any soda?

940
00:56:48,105 --> 00:56:51,336
I wouldn't wear this
to the shelter, you twit!

941
00:56:51,375 --> 00:56:53,843
Don't fight me, darling.
You can wear this anywhere.

942
00:56:53,877 --> 00:56:55,276
You trying to blind me?

943
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:01,442
Jesus, what the hell
have you done to my mother?

944
00:57:01,485 --> 00:57:02,952
I look silly, don't I?

945
00:57:04,621 --> 00:57:06,555
What a beauty.

946
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:09,457
I'm not a beauty.
I'm a photographer.

947
00:57:09,493 --> 00:57:13,589
Please, I'm more comfortable
on the other side of the camera.

948
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:16,793
You know what?
I don't want to be in Vogue.

949
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:20,870
Everybody wants to be in Vogue.

950
00:57:20,904 --> 00:57:22,769
Background action.

951
00:57:22,806 --> 00:57:27,140
Miss Betty, Al,
you don't have to do this.

952
00:57:27,911 --> 00:57:29,378
Are they getting paid?

953
00:57:29,413 --> 00:57:32,211
Nobody went over this with me.

954
00:57:32,249 --> 00:57:33,944
Wait. I said no.

955
00:57:33,984 --> 00:57:35,383
Don't we get food?

956
00:57:36,386 --> 00:57:39,287
Did anyone hear me?
We're not doing this.

957
00:57:39,323 --> 00:57:40,790
Get the hell off me.

958
00:57:40,824 --> 00:57:42,587
Al, Miss Betty, stop it!

959
00:57:42,626 --> 00:57:45,493
You don't have to model
if you don't want to.

960
00:57:46,530 --> 00:57:49,829
He's poor... he's white...

961
00:57:50,834 --> 00:57:52,495
but he sure ain't trash.

962
00:57:52,536 --> 00:57:54,868
God! I don't want to be a model.

963
00:57:57,908 --> 00:57:59,500
Oh, my God.

964
00:57:59,543 --> 00:58:00,840
What's the matter?

965
00:58:00,877 --> 00:58:02,435
She's choking to death!

966
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:04,174
Take a sip.

967
00:58:04,214 --> 00:58:05,943
Spit it out.

968
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:07,973
Good. Great.

969
00:58:08,018 --> 00:58:09,485
Somebody please call the doctor!

970
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:11,009
This is great. Good.

971
00:58:11,054 --> 00:58:14,023
- Stop taking my picture!
- A little over there. Good.

972
00:58:14,057 --> 00:58:16,116
Spit it up.

973
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:17,922
There, it's all better.

974
00:58:17,961 --> 00:58:20,088
Got your shot?

975
00:58:21,932 --> 00:58:23,593
I guess we can retouch.

976
00:58:23,633 --> 00:58:25,430
The Lord is with me.

977
00:58:25,469 --> 00:58:29,166
I know.

978
00:58:29,206 --> 00:58:30,798
Full of grace.

979
00:58:30,841 --> 00:58:32,433
You sure are.

980
00:58:32,476 --> 00:58:37,106
You're a virgin, a mother,
and you're all mine.

981
00:58:45,489 --> 00:58:46,615
Who is it?

982
00:58:46,656 --> 00:58:50,786
We're the Friends of Mary,
and we've come to see Our Lady.

983
00:58:50,827 --> 00:58:52,317
Be right down.

984
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:56,731
It's all right. Be right back.

985
00:58:56,767 --> 00:58:59,292
- They can't do this.
- Look at that baby.

986
00:59:00,737 --> 00:59:03,729
Goddamn it! Pig!

987
00:59:03,774 --> 00:59:05,036
Long live bush!

988
00:59:05,075 --> 00:59:06,667
Cover it up.

989
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:08,507
Get off me, motherfucker!

990
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:10,376
Shave it off!

991
00:59:10,414 --> 00:59:12,143
Pubic hair harassment!

992
00:59:12,182 --> 00:59:14,150
Beaver brutality!

993
00:59:14,184 --> 00:59:16,482
Pubic hair is against the law.

994
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:17,953
We want bush!

995
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:25,560
I'll make the money
off my Pelt, not you!

996
00:59:25,595 --> 00:59:29,656
T-Bone! I didn't want anybody
arrested for my pictures.

997
00:59:33,537 --> 00:59:34,936
Thanks.

998
00:59:40,811 --> 00:59:42,005
Thank you.

999
00:59:42,045 --> 00:59:45,378
Can't you see what pubic hair
is doing to this neighborhood?

1000
00:59:46,149 --> 00:59:47,878
Sinking your property values!

1001
00:59:47,918 --> 00:59:50,045
Get off! I didn't do anything.

1002
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:54,553
These nice ladies
have come to honor you.

1003
00:59:56,726 --> 00:59:58,523
Full of grace.

1004
00:59:58,562 --> 01:00:00,325
You're saying that yourself.

1005
01:00:00,363 --> 01:00:01,853
What do you mean?

1006
01:00:01,898 --> 01:00:03,695
You heard me, faker.

1007
01:00:03,733 --> 01:00:08,261
I need Mary's help.
Oh, you have company.

1008
01:00:08,305 --> 01:00:10,899
This is my grandson Pecker.

1009
01:00:10,941 --> 01:00:14,308
These are the Friends of Mary...
or so they say.

1010
01:00:14,344 --> 01:00:15,777
They're not being nice to her.

1011
01:00:15,812 --> 01:00:18,110
We can see her lips moving.

1012
01:00:18,148 --> 01:00:20,275
It's just a matter of faith,
ladies.

1013
01:00:20,317 --> 01:00:21,614
Here. Come on.

1014
01:00:21,651 --> 01:00:24,620
Shut your eyes
and think of the color blue.

1015
01:00:24,654 --> 01:00:28,112
No, you don't. Heretic!

1016
01:00:28,892 --> 01:00:31,383
Maryolatry is not a joke.

1017
01:00:31,428 --> 01:00:32,793
Full of grace.

1018
01:00:32,829 --> 01:00:35,992
This is too much
for my Catholic ears...

1019
01:00:36,032 --> 01:00:38,466
and I'm telling Monsignor.

1020
01:00:38,502 --> 01:00:42,165
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.

1021
01:00:42,205 --> 01:00:43,570
Blessed art thou among women...

1022
01:00:43,607 --> 01:00:46,007
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

1023
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:48,944
You can tell the pope
for all I care!

1024
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:50,446
My grandmother's a saint!

1025
01:00:54,551 --> 01:00:57,452
Ask Mary to make my life
like it used to be.

1026
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:59,114
I'll try.

1027
01:01:01,525 --> 01:01:03,959
Pecker has a request.

1028
01:01:03,994 --> 01:01:05,188
Come in, Mary.

1029
01:01:05,228 --> 01:01:08,197
It's me, Memama.

1030
01:01:10,967 --> 01:01:13,401
It's me, and I'm talking to you.

1031
01:01:13,436 --> 01:01:16,337
Mary was silent
for centuries, right?

1032
01:01:16,373 --> 01:01:19,672
I guess you can't expect her
to talk on demand.

1033
01:01:19,709 --> 01:01:20,869
Talk, goddamn it!

1034
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:26,709
It's your pictures.

1035
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:28,684
See what they've done?

1036
01:01:28,718 --> 01:01:31,380
They've ruined my miracle.

1037
01:01:47,037 --> 01:01:48,527
Come on!

1038
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:52,203
Right here, waiting.

1039
01:01:52,242 --> 01:01:53,402
Come on.

1040
01:01:55,011 --> 01:01:57,343
This is a gay establishment.

1041
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:58,574
We know.

1042
01:01:58,615 --> 01:01:59,912
We're here for the teabagging.

1043
01:01:59,950 --> 01:02:01,417
What teabagging?

1044
01:02:01,451 --> 01:02:03,976
We saw Pecker's pictures.
They're hilarious.

1045
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:05,988
Give me that.

1046
01:02:07,457 --> 01:02:08,981
Listen up!

1047
01:02:09,025 --> 01:02:10,788
There's no teabagging here...

1048
01:02:10,827 --> 01:02:12,920
and there's no straight people
allowed, either.

1049
01:02:12,963 --> 01:02:14,089
What?

1050
01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:15,688
Come on, all of youse.

1051
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:19,259
I need to see some gay I.D.,
or you're out of here.

1052
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:21,897
Take the money.

1053
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:32,681
Who will be
Mr. Rough Trade Baltimore?

1054
01:02:33,917 --> 01:02:35,214
Get away.

1055
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:41,891
Did you hear me?

1056
01:02:44,227 --> 01:02:45,819
Will it be Death Row Dave?

1057
01:02:52,569 --> 01:02:53,866
Dave's a three-time loser.

1058
01:02:53,903 --> 01:02:57,202
He's sentenced to the chair,
but he's still got a boner!

1059
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:01,805
His last request...

1060
01:03:01,845 --> 01:03:05,042
one more hum job before
they pull the switch.

1061
01:03:06,483 --> 01:03:07,848
Here he comes.

1062
01:03:07,884 --> 01:03:10,876
He's Matt the Thief.

1063
01:03:11,421 --> 01:03:14,083
He's barely legal,
but he's got the beef.

1064
01:03:15,959 --> 01:03:18,826
The kindest face
you'll ever find...

1065
01:03:18,862 --> 01:03:22,628
but if you own a store,
he'll shoplift you blind.

1066
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:25,661
You ruined my career.

1067
01:03:26,770 --> 01:03:28,431
I'm sorry.

1068
01:03:34,277 --> 01:03:37,838
- Billy Heckman!
- Dad?

1069
01:03:37,881 --> 01:03:40,076
You are queer!

1070
01:03:40,116 --> 01:03:42,914
No, Mom, I'm trade.
The queers blow me.

1071
01:03:45,221 --> 01:03:47,451
I don't blow them.
I'm still straight.

1072
01:03:49,959 --> 01:03:52,655
You get off that bar
and cover yourself!

1073
01:03:52,696 --> 01:03:54,493
Come here.
Watch your beer, sir.

1074
01:03:54,531 --> 01:03:56,396
Come on.

1075
01:03:56,433 --> 01:03:58,060
We're getting out of here.

1076
01:03:58,868 --> 01:04:01,564
Tina, you're fired.

1077
01:04:02,972 --> 01:04:05,065
Oh, God, no, Mr. Nellbox.

1078
01:04:05,108 --> 01:04:06,700
This is all my fault.

1079
01:04:06,743 --> 01:04:07,869
Don't blame Tina.

1080
01:04:07,911 --> 01:04:09,071
Please.

1081
01:04:11,748 --> 01:04:13,773
Trade is my life.

1082
01:04:19,222 --> 01:04:20,951
Because of your pictures...

1083
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:22,651
Iook what you did
to your sister.

1084
01:04:30,033 --> 01:04:32,058
Washing Machine Pervert, right?

1085
01:04:33,069 --> 01:04:34,331
Fabulous.

1086
01:04:36,406 --> 01:04:38,465
I sold this one to L'uomo Vogue.

1087
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:40,569
Good.

1088
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:42,874
This one... Don't you think
it would be perfect...

1089
01:04:42,912 --> 01:04:44,402
for that special edition...

1090
01:04:44,447 --> 01:04:46,506
Parkett magazine
wants you to do?

1091
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:48,483
Sure.

1092
01:04:48,518 --> 01:04:50,486
We got to talk.

1093
01:04:52,122 --> 01:04:53,646
These pictures...

1094
01:04:57,727 --> 01:05:00,025
they're just suddenly all shit.

1095
01:05:00,063 --> 01:05:01,428
Nonsense.

1096
01:05:01,464 --> 01:05:03,455
Your work just evolved.

1097
01:05:07,337 --> 01:05:08,497
Congratulations.

1098
01:05:09,773 --> 01:05:10,899
What's this?

1099
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:12,430
We're doing great.

1100
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:22,646
And for your Whitney show...

1101
01:05:26,556 --> 01:05:28,547
it will be a triumph of pain.

1102
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:30,957
That's a terrible poster.

1103
01:05:41,738 --> 01:05:44,298
I want to like it. I just don't.

1104
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:45,671
Shelley's out of context.

1105
01:05:45,708 --> 01:05:47,403
She's not like this.

1106
01:05:53,082 --> 01:05:56,279
How can you be
so kind and gentle...

1107
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:58,287
and still have talent?

1108
01:05:58,321 --> 01:06:01,722
I just try to do good work.

1109
01:06:01,758 --> 01:06:05,057
Could we be together just once?

1110
01:06:05,094 --> 01:06:06,288
You mean...

1111
01:06:08,698 --> 01:06:09,858
For the Whitney?

1112
01:06:12,702 --> 01:06:14,260
But you're my art dealer.

1113
01:06:14,304 --> 01:06:15,965
That's right. I am...

1114
01:06:16,005 --> 01:06:18,997
and I also understand
your vision.

1115
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:25,674
Just once...

1116
01:06:25,715 --> 01:06:27,842
for art.

1117
01:06:34,891 --> 01:06:36,620
Oh, my God!

1118
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:39,059
It's not what you think!

1119
01:06:39,095 --> 01:06:40,858
It's all about the work!

1120
01:06:40,897 --> 01:06:43,388
I hate modern photography!

1121
01:06:49,372 --> 01:06:51,840
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
for this to happen.

1122
01:06:51,875 --> 01:06:53,604
You're not supposed
to have sex with people...

1123
01:06:53,643 --> 01:06:54,974
you're trying to help.

1124
01:06:58,081 --> 01:07:00,311
I didn't plan it.

1125
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:01,977
I like Shelley.
She's a sweetheart.

1126
01:07:03,486 --> 01:07:06,216
I just wanted a real boyfriend,
not some art person.

1127
01:07:07,891 --> 01:07:09,222
Cancel the Whitney.

1128
01:07:10,393 --> 01:07:12,554
You can't do that.

1129
01:07:12,595 --> 01:07:16,053
I want my friends, family,
and career back!

1130
01:07:18,067 --> 01:07:19,329
Let's talk.

1131
01:07:19,369 --> 01:07:22,668
Don't leave.
We can work this out.

1132
01:07:24,474 --> 01:07:25,805
What about New York?

1133
01:07:28,444 --> 01:07:30,275
They can come to me.

1134
01:07:30,313 --> 01:07:33,146
I'm going to have my own show
here in Baltimore.

1135
01:07:33,182 --> 01:07:34,308
But the Whitney!

1136
01:07:34,350 --> 01:07:37,046
What am I supposed
to tell the Whitney?

1137
01:07:37,086 --> 01:07:39,281
Shelley, I love you!

1138
01:07:40,290 --> 01:07:43,259
I love you more than Kodak!

1139
01:07:48,498 --> 01:07:49,658
Wait!

1140
01:07:51,534 --> 01:07:54,367
Help, police! He took a dump
without buying anything!

1141
01:07:54,404 --> 01:07:56,372
Get off me.

1142
01:07:56,406 --> 01:07:58,374
Police!
I'm making a citizen's arrest!

1143
01:07:58,408 --> 01:08:00,433
Matt, I got paid.

1144
01:08:00,476 --> 01:08:04,276
I'll give you a job,
and this time, you're on salary.

1145
01:08:04,314 --> 01:08:05,576
All right, Pecker-man.

1146
01:08:05,615 --> 01:08:07,139
You're the boss.

1147
01:08:08,618 --> 01:08:09,846
Bastards!

1148
01:08:21,531 --> 01:08:23,226
Voting card, please.

1149
01:08:26,002 --> 01:08:28,971
You can take the second booth
on your right.

1150
01:08:29,005 --> 01:08:30,495
Thank you.

1151
01:08:37,714 --> 01:08:38,942
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

1152
01:08:38,982 --> 01:08:40,381
Your voting cards, please?

1153
01:08:40,416 --> 01:08:42,475
I don't have it with me,
but I'm registered.

1154
01:08:42,518 --> 01:08:43,678
My name is Pecker.

1155
01:08:48,024 --> 01:08:50,049
Excuse me.

1156
01:08:50,093 --> 01:08:51,890
Do you have a bathroom?

1157
01:08:51,928 --> 01:08:55,625
This is a polling place,
not a filling station.

1158
01:08:55,665 --> 01:08:56,825
Excuse me.

1159
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:02,828
Voting booths
are private places, Mr. Pecker.

1160
01:09:02,872 --> 01:09:04,134
If I were you,
I would concentrate...

1161
01:09:04,173 --> 01:09:05,902
on my own personal choice
of candidate...

1162
01:09:05,942 --> 01:09:07,671
and not the choices of others.

1163
01:09:09,278 --> 01:09:11,337
I really have to use
the bathroom.

1164
01:09:11,381 --> 01:09:13,178
One would think
a serious voter...

1165
01:09:13,216 --> 01:09:15,741
would eliminate
before leaving home.

1166
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:18,681
But it's an emergency.

1167
01:09:18,721 --> 01:09:21,622
All right. Here.

1168
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:22,783
Thanks.

1169
01:09:22,825 --> 01:09:25,692
It's through that door
and to the left.

1170
01:09:25,728 --> 01:09:28,288
To the left!

1171
01:09:33,469 --> 01:09:35,664
Mr. Pecker?

1172
01:09:35,705 --> 01:09:37,468
I'll be right back.

1173
01:09:37,507 --> 01:09:39,134
I'm trying to vote.

1174
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:40,403
Come on.

1175
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:43,607
Mr. Pecker, did you hear me?

1176
01:09:43,646 --> 01:09:45,443
Oh, God.

1177
01:09:45,481 --> 01:09:47,312
Let me stand in your bag.

1178
01:09:51,921 --> 01:09:53,912
She can't see me now.

1179
01:09:56,492 --> 01:09:58,790
Attention, voters.

1180
01:09:59,862 --> 01:10:05,357
No two people are allowed
in a voting booth.

1181
01:10:06,369 --> 01:10:11,329
More than one person
inside a voting booth...

1182
01:10:11,374 --> 01:10:13,569
is a federal offense...

1183
01:10:13,609 --> 01:10:15,133
punishable...

1184
01:10:16,846 --> 01:10:19,940
by up to three years in prison.

1185
01:10:19,982 --> 01:10:22,041
Please come back.

1186
01:10:22,085 --> 01:10:24,519
Without you, my work is shit.

1187
01:10:24,554 --> 01:10:26,681
Rorey's your work.

1188
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:28,485
It's you that I love.

1189
01:10:29,659 --> 01:10:31,490
I don't understand
that art crap.

1190
01:10:32,562 --> 01:10:35,087
You could
if you just opened your eyes.

1191
01:10:35,131 --> 01:10:37,759
I work in a Laundromat.

1192
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:39,859
Art's everywhere.

1193
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:42,268
In my endless bags
of dirty laundry.

1194
01:10:42,805 --> 01:10:45,137
It is, if you think about it.

1195
01:10:46,275 --> 01:10:47,708
What?

1196
01:10:47,743 --> 01:10:50,678
The brilliant green
of a grass stain?

1197
01:10:50,713 --> 01:10:52,908
That's art.

1198
01:10:52,949 --> 01:10:55,782
The subtle yellow
of a urine-soaked sheet?

1199
01:10:55,818 --> 01:10:57,911
Keep going.

1200
01:10:57,954 --> 01:10:59,751
It's what you see every day.

1201
01:10:59,789 --> 01:11:01,654
The aqua blue of cold water...

1202
01:11:01,691 --> 01:11:03,522
as it dilutes a violent
red blood stain?

1203
01:11:03,559 --> 01:11:06,289
You got it.

1204
01:11:06,329 --> 01:11:09,423
Be spontaneous
for once in your life.

1205
01:11:09,465 --> 01:11:11,558
I'm scared.

1206
01:11:11,601 --> 01:11:14,570
The almond brown of a stubborn
mildew stain can be beautiful?

1207
01:11:14,604 --> 01:11:18,233
Let your mind go,
and you'll be free forever.

1208
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:20,538
I think I finally see it.

1209
01:11:20,576 --> 01:11:23,568
Art.

1210
01:11:24,947 --> 01:11:26,574
Use a condom.

1211
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:53,558
Settle down, folks.

1212
01:12:53,603 --> 01:12:55,571
I know we're all excited.

1213
01:12:55,605 --> 01:12:57,732
Take it away.

1214
01:12:57,773 --> 01:12:59,468
Ladies and gentlemen.

1215
01:13:01,077 --> 01:13:02,806
Welcome to Pecker's Place.

1216
01:13:17,426 --> 01:13:19,724
We're here with Pecker's
grandmother Memama.

1217
01:13:19,762 --> 01:13:22,196
Tell us, why won't Mary talk?

1218
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:23,596
She went up, that's all.

1219
01:13:23,633 --> 01:13:25,464
Mary's broke.

1220
01:13:25,501 --> 01:13:29,096
But if channel 45's viewers
pray hard enough...

1221
01:13:29,138 --> 01:13:32,164
maybe Our Lady will speak again.

1222
01:13:32,208 --> 01:13:34,938
I'm Sloane Brown,
Channel 45 News...

1223
01:13:34,977 --> 01:13:36,376
live at Pecker's Place.

1224
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:38,073
What's going on?
How you doing?

1225
01:13:38,114 --> 01:13:40,048
You're going through.

1226
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:41,674
I know you.

1227
01:13:41,717 --> 01:13:43,617
Look.

1228
01:13:45,187 --> 01:13:47,712
Friends of the Whitney...

1229
01:13:47,757 --> 01:13:50,055
this is Baltimore.

1230
01:13:51,327 --> 01:13:53,295
Wonderful. Let's get off.

1231
01:13:57,166 --> 01:13:59,066
Look...

1232
01:13:59,101 --> 01:14:00,796
a row house.

1233
01:14:02,305 --> 01:14:04,796
With white marble steps.

1234
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:07,809
It's just like his pictures.

1235
01:14:07,843 --> 01:14:09,902
It's so dignified.

1236
01:14:09,945 --> 01:14:11,469
So powerful.

1237
01:14:11,514 --> 01:14:14,574
It's almost sexual, isn't it?

1238
01:14:14,617 --> 01:14:16,710
You with the goiter in the back.

1239
01:14:16,752 --> 01:14:19,380
How you doing? You.

1240
01:14:19,422 --> 01:14:22,585
Excuse me, I'm Jed Coleman.
This is the Whitney group.

1241
01:14:22,625 --> 01:14:25,423
It's four dollars
for each of you.

1242
01:14:26,429 --> 01:14:29,125
I didn't know
there was a cover charge.

1243
01:14:29,165 --> 01:14:31,099
I thought you liked it
when I stole.

1244
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:39,132
Congratulations.

1245
01:14:39,175 --> 01:14:40,665
Thank you.

1246
01:14:40,710 --> 01:14:42,337
It's not just me.

1247
01:14:42,378 --> 01:14:44,972
It's my friends, my family.

1248
01:14:45,014 --> 01:14:48,040
Everyone here inspires me.

1249
01:14:48,084 --> 01:14:50,484
Pecker sees New York
from the outside looking in...

1250
01:14:50,519 --> 01:14:54,046
and if you just open your eyes,
you'll see it, too.

1251
01:14:55,124 --> 01:14:57,786
I see what you mean.

1252
01:14:57,827 --> 01:14:59,795
That skinny lady in the photo...

1253
01:14:59,829 --> 01:15:02,127
That's fucking hilarious.

1254
01:15:02,164 --> 01:15:03,688
I love it.

1255
01:15:09,672 --> 01:15:12,266
We're open for business.
What do you got to trade?

1256
01:15:12,308 --> 01:15:15,106
I do own a bakery.

1257
01:15:15,144 --> 01:15:17,442
How about complimentary
birthday cakes...

1258
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:19,448
for each member of your family
for two years?

1259
01:15:19,482 --> 01:15:21,177
It's a deal.

1260
01:15:21,217 --> 01:15:23,082
I'm putting it
in my rumpus room.

1261
01:15:27,490 --> 01:15:31,893
Mr. Coleman,
so glad you could make it.

1262
01:15:31,927 --> 01:15:33,485
How does it feel to be
in front of the camera?

1263
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:35,019
Well, it...

1264
01:15:35,965 --> 01:15:37,956
takes a little getting used to.

1265
01:15:41,203 --> 01:15:44,639
Hi, Mary! Welcome to Baltimore.

1266
01:15:59,922 --> 01:16:03,790
I didn't know Pecker
was showing this work.

1267
01:16:06,295 --> 01:16:08,855
Pecker, darling.
I want to see lowlife.

1268
01:16:08,898 --> 01:16:11,662
Show me down and dirty.

1269
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:13,429
It's just us, Lynn.

1270
01:16:13,469 --> 01:16:15,835
You remember Shelley, right?

1271
01:16:15,871 --> 01:16:17,771
Congratulations.

1272
01:16:22,077 --> 01:16:24,204
Oh, my God.

1273
01:16:24,246 --> 01:16:26,441
You look daringly original.

1274
01:16:26,482 --> 01:16:28,416
There's not a catalog, is there?

1275
01:16:28,451 --> 01:16:31,284
Nice tits, ma'am.

1276
01:16:39,094 --> 01:16:42,120
It's the liquor lady.
Want to dance?

1277
01:16:42,164 --> 01:16:45,099
I only had two drinks
that night.

1278
01:16:45,134 --> 01:16:46,897
Think I care?

1279
01:16:46,936 --> 01:16:48,335
I drink, too.

1280
01:16:48,370 --> 01:16:50,361
Set 'em up.

1281
01:16:54,477 --> 01:16:55,944
There you go.

1282
01:16:55,978 --> 01:16:58,947
Oh, Miss Betty,
that looks wonderful.

1283
01:16:58,981 --> 01:17:00,278
I don't know.

1284
01:17:00,316 --> 01:17:03,080
Will it wrinkle
if I sleep in it?

1285
01:17:03,118 --> 01:17:05,313
Not that fabric.

1286
01:17:05,354 --> 01:17:06,787
That's flameproof, too...

1287
01:17:06,822 --> 01:17:08,983
in case someone
sets you on fire.

1288
01:17:09,024 --> 01:17:11,686
All right. I'll take it.

1289
01:17:11,727 --> 01:17:13,217
Good.

1290
01:17:16,499 --> 01:17:18,729
Isn't fashion something?

1291
01:17:23,372 --> 01:17:25,431
Here comes the vegan.

1292
01:17:25,474 --> 01:17:27,669
Chrissy's a good little girl.

1293
01:17:27,710 --> 01:17:29,871
She looks so different.

1294
01:17:31,213 --> 01:17:33,408
Little Chrissy's off the drugs.

1295
01:17:33,449 --> 01:17:36,748
She's sugar-free and on the road
to a balanced diet.

1296
01:17:36,785 --> 01:17:38,275
Thank you, honey.

1297
01:17:39,622 --> 01:17:42,386
Come on, gorgeous, be honest.

1298
01:17:42,424 --> 01:17:43,914
When was the last time...

1299
01:17:43,959 --> 01:17:46,189
a straight guy
asked you to dance?

1300
01:17:48,397 --> 01:17:49,762
Go on, Venetia.

1301
01:17:49,798 --> 01:17:50,924
Get it, girl.

1302
01:17:50,966 --> 01:17:52,729
Go on. You're in Baltimore.

1303
01:18:20,129 --> 01:18:22,461
Congratulations, Pecker.
Shelley.

1304
01:18:24,166 --> 01:18:26,066
Thank you.
I'm glad you could come.

1305
01:18:26,101 --> 01:18:28,865
This is my new discovery Randy.

1306
01:18:28,904 --> 01:18:32,135
He's from New Jersey and is
the first blind photographer.

1307
01:18:32,174 --> 01:18:35,541
I feel portraits,
and I smell landscapes.

1308
01:18:35,578 --> 01:18:37,443
I'm giving him a show
in November.

1309
01:18:37,479 --> 01:18:39,208
Is that outsider art?

1310
01:18:39,248 --> 01:18:41,182
No more light readings.

1311
01:18:41,216 --> 01:18:43,081
No more focusing.

1312
01:18:43,118 --> 01:18:45,143
Maybe you should give him
a show in your Laundromat.

1313
01:18:45,187 --> 01:18:47,087
Send me some slides.

1314
01:18:47,122 --> 01:18:48,612
I'll do that.

1315
01:19:05,741 --> 01:19:07,800
Go, T-Bone!

1316
01:19:10,245 --> 01:19:12,713
All right, T-Bone!

1317
01:19:28,230 --> 01:19:30,562
No pubic hair!

1318
01:19:32,301 --> 01:19:34,792
No vagrants!

1319
01:19:51,654 --> 01:19:53,212
Take your pants off.

1320
01:20:20,215 --> 01:20:22,547
Teabag him, Larry.

1321
01:20:25,454 --> 01:20:27,251
Brilliant work.

1322
01:20:27,289 --> 01:20:29,519
Thanks, Mr. Hallbrook.

1323
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:33,621
Shake it, sweetheart!

1324
01:20:35,130 --> 01:20:38,361
Ride it, bitch!
Ride it like a butch bottom!

1325
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:41,164
New York was never like this!

1326
01:20:41,203 --> 01:20:44,764
Holy Mary, Mother of God.

1327
01:20:49,311 --> 01:20:52,940
She's talking,
and I'm not saying anything.

1328
01:20:52,981 --> 01:20:54,972
Full of grace...

1329
01:20:55,017 --> 01:20:57,349
Holy Mary, Mother of God.

1330
01:20:57,386 --> 01:20:59,479
Our prayers have been answered.

1331
01:20:59,521 --> 01:21:01,489
Full of grace.

1332
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:04,048
Holy Mary, Mother of God.

1333
01:21:04,093 --> 01:21:06,220
Grace. Holy.

1334
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:10,227
Grace. God.

1335
01:21:10,265 --> 01:21:11,732
Holy.

1336
01:21:13,402 --> 01:21:15,632
Do you think
it's a real miracle?

1337
01:21:26,682 --> 01:21:28,809
Quiet, please.

1338
01:21:30,385 --> 01:21:32,751
Quiet, everybody.

1339
01:21:32,788 --> 01:21:34,983
Come on in. Gather around.

1340
01:21:35,023 --> 01:21:37,218
Pecker, get up here.

1341
01:21:47,536 --> 01:21:49,697
I have a toast.

1342
01:21:50,706 --> 01:21:51,866
To Pecker.

1343
01:21:51,907 --> 01:21:53,465
To Pecker!

1344
01:21:53,509 --> 01:21:55,477
And the end of irony!

1345
01:22:04,953 --> 01:22:07,012
What's next?

1346
01:22:07,055 --> 01:22:08,215
Well...

1347
01:22:10,492 --> 01:22:11,959
I think...

1348
01:22:13,896 --> 01:22:15,261
You know what?

1349
01:22:15,297 --> 01:22:17,891
I'm thinking
of directing a movie.

1350
01:22:17,933 --> 01:22:19,127
All right!
