1
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,960
Harlem life is... Harlem life...

2
00:01:19,336 --> 00:01:21,566
Harlem life is hard body.

3
00:01:21,739 --> 00:01:24,936
Uptown, baby. Holler.

4
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:26,508
Harlem life is hard.

5
00:01:30,114 --> 00:01:31,979
Harlem life is hard body.

6
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,350
Less than 16 but eight.

7
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:38,019
But eight to sum it up,
and make this whole city late.

8
00:01:40,891 --> 00:01:42,654
Less than 16 but eight.

9
00:01:42,827 --> 00:01:45,455
To sum it up,
and make this whole city late.

10
00:01:45,629 --> 00:01:47,187
Shit.

11
00:01:57,308 --> 00:01:59,003
But eight...

12
00:02:02,847 --> 00:02:05,213
All right. Freeze.

13
00:02:05,382 --> 00:02:07,509
Do not move.

14
00:02:08,552 --> 00:02:10,247
Sorry, Ma.
I just needed the money.

15
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:13,254
So is this how you got
your MP3?

16
00:02:14,825 --> 00:02:16,622
Hello?

17
00:02:17,294 --> 00:02:19,194
Money for what?

18
00:02:19,396 --> 00:02:21,193
Cross the street.

19
00:02:21,799 --> 00:02:23,357
For what?

20
00:02:23,534 --> 00:02:26,162
- For a contest.
- What contest?

21
00:02:26,337 --> 00:02:27,953
The winner gets a record deal.

22
00:02:27,954 --> 00:02:30,000
It's tonight. Look, I had no choice.

23
00:02:30,174 --> 00:02:33,268
Rob, you always have a choice.

24
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:35,241
Always.

25
00:02:37,214 --> 00:02:39,182
It's not like you would
have given me cash.

26
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,749
Try me.

27
00:02:40,918 --> 00:02:43,978
You ain't never wonder why a car
like that was just sitting there?

28
00:02:44,155 --> 00:02:45,486
Parked like that?

29
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,687
Whose is it?

30
00:02:47,858 --> 00:02:49,382
Electric.

31
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,051
- Who's that?
- He's syndicate.

32
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:55,323
- Syndicate?
- The Mafia, son.

33
00:02:55,499 --> 00:02:59,162
- Are you serious, man?
- Yeah, I'm serious, son.

34
00:02:59,436 --> 00:03:00,494
Damn.

35
00:03:20,124 --> 00:03:22,010
What up, what up, what up, yo?

36
00:03:22,011 --> 00:03:23,958
Let's hear it for Young Rome.

37
00:03:24,128 --> 00:03:27,757
And now, my dog
from the pound, y'all.

38
00:03:27,932 --> 00:03:31,265
DJ Trippe and Rob Royce.

39
00:03:32,536 --> 00:03:33,836
Hey, yo, what's good, fam?

40
00:03:33,837 --> 00:03:35,437
Coming straight out of Harlem.

41
00:03:35,606 --> 00:03:38,104
We gonna have a 
good time tonight.

42
00:03:38,105 --> 00:03:39,940
It's gonna be all good.

43
00:04:23,187 --> 00:04:24,449
Put your hands up.

44
00:04:24,622 --> 00:04:27,113
That's that punk
that ripped off my rims?

45
00:04:29,693 --> 00:04:32,093
Let's shut this club down.

46
00:04:39,803 --> 00:04:41,202
- This way.
- I gotta get my mom.

47
00:04:41,372 --> 00:04:44,205
- I'll get your mother. Just go, man.
- Shit!

48
00:04:51,215 --> 00:04:53,479
Okay. No.

49
00:04:59,423 --> 00:05:01,948
I'll call you back. Bye.

50
00:05:02,326 --> 00:05:04,021
Who was that?

51
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:08,891
Ma.

52
00:05:11,168 --> 00:05:12,192
It was your father.

53
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,240
My father?

54
00:05:20,377 --> 00:05:22,971
I thought you said
you didn't know where he was.

55
00:05:23,881 --> 00:05:25,542
Well, I do.

56
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,930
He's in Puerto Rico,
and he wants you

57
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:33,917
to come stay with him
for a little while.

58
00:05:34,091 --> 00:05:35,355
I don't even know that dude.

59
00:05:35,356 --> 00:05:36,889
I don't know what he looks like.

60
00:05:37,227 --> 00:05:39,752
- He's still your father.
- To me, he's not.

61
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:43,190
Someone shot at you last
night in front of my own eyes.

62
00:05:43,367 --> 00:05:45,232
Ma, what you want me to do,
keep running?

63
00:05:45,569 --> 00:05:47,560
You are going, and that is that.

64
00:05:55,112 --> 00:05:57,205
I love you, son.

65
00:06:27,378 --> 00:06:28,811
Robert?

66
00:06:29,513 --> 00:06:30,980
Yeah.

67
00:06:32,883 --> 00:06:35,716
- Let me take this for you.
- No, no, it's cool, I got it.

68
00:06:36,653 --> 00:06:38,621
The car is over here.

69
00:06:55,105 --> 00:06:56,868
You speak Spanish?

70
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,530
No.

71
00:06:58,942 --> 00:07:00,671
It's okay.

72
00:07:01,945 --> 00:07:04,243
Most people here speak English.

73
00:07:13,123 --> 00:07:16,422
You're gonna meet Marivi,
my wife, and Javi.

74
00:07:25,836 --> 00:07:26,996
This is Marivi.

75
00:07:28,105 --> 00:07:30,073
It's very nice to meet you.

76
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,730
Hi.

77
00:07:33,844 --> 00:07:37,780
We made a bed for you.
It's not much...

78
00:07:39,216 --> 00:07:41,616
...but it's yours
as long as you need it.

79
00:07:42,486 --> 00:07:45,353
It's much more comfortable
than it looks.

80
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,728
Well, then. I...

81
00:07:52,896 --> 00:07:54,761
I guess I better be getting
back to work.

82
00:07:58,735 --> 00:08:00,726
I'll see you in the morning.

83
00:08:09,813 --> 00:08:13,408
Well, I'm sure you're tired, so...

84
00:08:13,584 --> 00:08:16,644
The bathroom is down the hall.

85
00:08:18,856 --> 00:08:22,485
Okay. Have a good night, okay?

86
00:08:23,327 --> 00:08:24,885
Thanks.

87
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:49,408
Good morning.
How did you sleep?

88
00:08:49,653 --> 00:08:50,677
Fine, thanks.

89
00:08:50,854 --> 00:08:54,187
Now, I hope you're hungry.
Breakfast is almost ready.

90
00:09:08,939 --> 00:09:10,634
Javi.

91
00:09:11,074 --> 00:09:13,235
Javi, come on. 
I have to go.

92
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:22,941
- Robert, this is Javi.
- What's up?

93
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,850
This is Robert.
He was so excited to meet you.

94
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:29,424
But anyway, I have to go to work,
so you make yourself at home.

95
00:09:29,593 --> 00:09:31,322
Show him around.

96
00:09:31,695 --> 00:09:33,424
You know, show him the city.

97
00:09:33,597 --> 00:09:36,725
And, okay, here is some money
your dad left...

98
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,334
...just in case
you need anything.

99
00:09:40,203 --> 00:09:41,693
All right.

100
00:09:42,172 --> 00:09:45,699
I'll see you later. 
Okay? Bye-bye.

101
00:09:55,152 --> 00:09:58,383
- You smoke?
- Smoke what?

102
00:10:00,023 --> 00:10:02,048
New York, really?

103
00:10:02,259 --> 00:10:05,228
One day I would love
to live in New York.

104
00:10:05,963 --> 00:10:08,830
My father told me a lot of stories
about New York.

105
00:10:10,033 --> 00:10:11,933
Your father?

106
00:10:13,036 --> 00:10:14,799
Where is he?

107
00:10:15,305 --> 00:10:16,829
He died.

108
00:10:17,007 --> 00:10:19,271
He died like a few years ago.

109
00:10:19,776 --> 00:10:22,745
- I'm sorry, man.
- That's okay, man.

110
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:25,814
I hear you have some problems
back home.

111
00:10:31,254 --> 00:10:34,815
You see that bald guy on the left?
Up there.

112
00:10:34,992 --> 00:10:39,019
You ever need anything,
he's the guy to talk to.

113
00:10:39,196 --> 00:10:41,323
He'll take care of you
as long as he likes you.

114
00:10:41,498 --> 00:10:42,590
Oh, okay.

115
00:10:46,136 --> 00:10:47,831
How you say?

116
00:10:48,005 --> 00:10:50,735
It's the unofficial mayor
of the neighborhood.

117
00:10:51,008 --> 00:10:53,442
Oh, you wanna go to Old San Juan,
get some piraguas?

118
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:56,704
- I got money, brother. I got money.
- Oh, so that's how you do it?

119
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,781
You ask for money,
you get money, right?

120
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:03,511
Muchacho, no, man. It's because
you here I got this, brother.

121
00:11:04,087 --> 00:11:06,647
You wanna play a game?
You want this $20?

122
00:11:06,823 --> 00:11:09,155
If you can catch it, the money's yours.
You ready?

123
00:11:09,326 --> 00:11:10,588
- You ready?
- Right here.

124
00:11:10,761 --> 00:11:12,092
- You ready?
- Yep.

125
00:11:16,199 --> 00:11:17,689
Watch out.

126
00:11:18,402 --> 00:11:19,426
Yeah!

127
00:11:53,804 --> 00:11:55,567
So look, man.

128
00:11:55,939 --> 00:11:58,407
Back home, I stole some rims
from this dude, man.

129
00:11:59,376 --> 00:12:01,571
That's the reason why I'm here.

130
00:12:01,745 --> 00:12:04,680
Have you ever really needed
to do something real bad, man?

131
00:12:04,848 --> 00:12:06,315
And you just couldn't?

132
00:12:07,918 --> 00:12:10,045
Yeah, pero not that bad.

133
00:12:10,353 --> 00:12:13,379
I guess you had it
a little bit better than I did.

134
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,493
Shit happens, man.
Don't worry about it.

135
00:12:19,663 --> 00:12:21,255
Please come and see us, okay?

136
00:12:21,765 --> 00:12:24,165
- Check this out.
- I'll see you there.

137
00:12:29,873 --> 00:12:31,738
Do you guys wanna
come to a show tonight?

138
00:12:31,908 --> 00:12:34,775
Ten o'clock. 
My friend's performing.

139
00:12:42,652 --> 00:12:44,085
- Bye.
- Bye.

140
00:12:44,254 --> 00:12:46,119
Damn. That's how y'all
doing it in 'Rico?

141
00:12:46,289 --> 00:12:47,881
That's how we do it.

142
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:50,288
Voltio. You ever heard of Voltio?

143
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,428
He's an amazing
reggaeton artist.

144
00:12:52,796 --> 00:12:56,698
His music is like a mix of, like,
reggae, rap, parranda, merengue.

145
00:12:56,867 --> 00:12:58,357
Oh, that's dope, man.

146
00:12:58,535 --> 00:13:00,469
Seems like
a crazy combination, man.

147
00:13:00,637 --> 00:13:02,366
It's like music from the ghetto.

148
00:13:02,539 --> 00:13:06,407
You know, it's about our struggle,
our dreams. You ever had a dream?

149
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,439
Come on, tell me.

150
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,750
All right, well,
you know what I'm saying?

151
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:19,184
Maybe, you know, getting in front
of an audience, performing, you know.

152
00:13:19,356 --> 00:13:20,948
Rapping, doing my thing,
you know.

153
00:13:21,858 --> 00:13:23,883
Same here, brother.
It's the same, man.

154
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,749
Everybody has a dream, man.

155
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,188
And dreaming is free.

156
00:13:30,167 --> 00:13:32,328
Okay, senora.

157
00:13:35,739 --> 00:13:37,730
Gracias, Linda.

158
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:56,854
You like the food, Rob?

159
00:13:56,855 --> 00:13:58,824
It's a typical Puerto Rican dish.

160
00:13:58,995 --> 00:14:02,863
Ma. You think he's going
to say your food sucks?

161
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:08,231
There's a reggaeton show
tonight.

162
00:14:09,206 --> 00:14:13,142
- Oh, really? Again?
- No, pero, Dad, it's Pedro's son.

163
00:14:14,845 --> 00:14:16,710
Julio Voltio.

164
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,745
Oh, yeah, yeah, Julio.

165
00:14:20,016 --> 00:14:22,314
You're gonna see tonight.
You're gonna see.

166
00:14:22,485 --> 00:14:24,544
You know,
Roberto's a musician also.

167
00:14:24,721 --> 00:14:27,281
- He played with some of the best...
- Oh, Marivi, please.

168
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:30,793
So you used to play music, huh?

169
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:34,255
I don't play anymore.

170
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:49,437
What's up, mama?

171
00:17:22,665 --> 00:17:24,155
Hey, give me a Heineken.

172
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:26,063
Thanks.

173
00:17:27,437 --> 00:17:29,962
Hey, what's up, bro?
What's going on?

174
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:33,439
- Chilling.
- Your music is hot!

175
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:36,579
You know it.
Reggaeton is where it's at!

176
00:17:36,746 --> 00:17:39,442
Look, this is my stepbrother, Rob.

177
00:17:39,616 --> 00:17:40,605
What's going on, bro?

178
00:17:40,784 --> 00:17:42,945
- It's good.
- All right?

179
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:45,417
Man, are you still playing?

180
00:17:45,588 --> 00:17:48,182
Always, brother, always.

181
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:49,916
That's it, brother.

182
00:17:50,093 --> 00:17:52,220
Man, say hi
to your father, Roberto.

183
00:17:52,629 --> 00:17:53,789
Sure, thank you.

184
00:17:53,963 --> 00:17:56,431
- Yeah, you got it!
- Take care.

185
00:17:56,599 --> 00:18:00,729
Hey, what's up, girl?
Wanna dance the Perrero?

186
00:18:05,842 --> 00:18:08,106
- It was so good.
- Thank you so much. You liked it?

187
00:18:08,278 --> 00:18:09,745
- I did.
- It was good, right?

188
00:18:09,913 --> 00:18:11,403
Thank you.

189
00:18:13,183 --> 00:18:15,276
Hey, I saw you on the stage.

190
00:18:15,452 --> 00:18:18,182
- It was hot.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.

191
00:18:18,655 --> 00:18:20,919
- How do you know Voltio?
- His father and my father...

192
00:18:21,091 --> 00:18:22,854
...went to the same school.
- Oh, yeah?

193
00:18:23,026 --> 00:18:24,789
They had a band
called The Artichokes.

194
00:18:24,961 --> 00:18:27,191
So you guys are musicians too?

195
00:18:28,364 --> 00:18:30,423
My brother is a rapper
from New York.

196
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,160
I'm trying to be,
you know what I'm saying? But I...

197
00:18:33,336 --> 00:18:35,167
- Yo, C.C.
- Hey.

198
00:18:36,239 --> 00:18:37,365
We gotta talk.

199
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,701
Leave me alone.

200
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,640
I'm not your girlfriend anymore.

201
00:18:45,115 --> 00:18:47,709
- Would you just talk to me?
- I can't.

202
00:18:48,184 --> 00:18:49,947
Do you wanna come smoke
with me?

203
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,588
- So you smoke now?
- Yes, I do.

204
00:19:03,633 --> 00:19:06,295
Hey, my bad about inside,
you know what I'm saying?

205
00:19:06,469 --> 00:19:08,164
It's okay.

206
00:19:09,172 --> 00:19:12,903
- Look, I don't really smoke.
- I don't either.

207
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,141
- Rob, right?
- Yeah. C.C.?

208
00:19:19,315 --> 00:19:21,715
- Yeah.
- All right.

209
00:19:22,719 --> 00:19:23,981
C.C.

210
00:19:26,789 --> 00:19:28,427
We are headed to San Juan.

211
00:19:28,428 --> 00:19:30,316
Alexis and Fido are playing.

212
00:19:30,493 --> 00:19:32,484
Do you guys wanna go?

213
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,962
- Let's go.
- All right.

214
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:57,545
Oh, yeah, C.C., nice boyfriend.

215
00:20:11,434 --> 00:20:13,231
Okay.

216
00:20:16,172 --> 00:20:19,232
The Vega brothers
are getting some tonight.

217
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:29,948
Come on, let's go dance.

218
00:20:30,753 --> 00:20:31,913
Let's groove.

219
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:52,132
There you go, Mimi.

220
00:20:53,409 --> 00:20:55,809
Come on, dance with me.

221
00:22:17,694 --> 00:22:20,959
So can I see you again?

222
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,666
- Why?
- What do you mean why?

223
00:22:26,302 --> 00:22:30,762
- Why do you wanna see me again?
- Because we have things in common.

224
00:22:31,741 --> 00:22:33,834
No, but I think you're cool.

225
00:22:36,913 --> 00:22:39,347
Okay. I'll give you a call.

226
00:22:40,116 --> 00:22:41,811
Yo, Javi.

227
00:22:41,984 --> 00:22:43,815
Yo, what's the number?

228
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:48,086
255-3489.

229
00:22:48,691 --> 00:22:51,717
He's crazy.
All right, do you got it?

230
00:22:51,894 --> 00:22:53,759
- Yes, I got it.
- Okay.

231
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:55,622
I need to go.

232
00:22:55,798 --> 00:22:58,562
All right, peace.
That was funny.

233
00:23:00,737 --> 00:23:01,897
Call me.

234
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,431
Bye.

235
00:23:04,941 --> 00:23:06,636
Bye.

236
00:23:12,215 --> 00:23:13,842
Do you have everything?

237
00:24:48,845 --> 00:24:50,073
Yo. Yo.

238
00:24:53,015 --> 00:24:54,277
Hurry.

239
00:24:59,222 --> 00:25:00,246
Come on, right here.

240
00:25:21,177 --> 00:25:22,838
- Hello.
- Hello, Rob.

241
00:25:23,012 --> 00:25:24,877
Yeah, what's good?

242
00:25:25,348 --> 00:25:28,613
- Am I calling you too early?
- No, just in time.

243
00:25:28,784 --> 00:25:31,378
Can I come over?
I need some help with something.

244
00:25:32,021 --> 00:25:33,579
Yeah, sure, no problem.

245
00:25:34,457 --> 00:25:36,288
- Are you okay?
- I'll call you back. Bye.

246
00:25:39,462 --> 00:25:40,690
Come on.

247
00:26:04,253 --> 00:26:05,982
Yo.

248
00:26:06,188 --> 00:26:07,985
What's good, man?
What you doing?

249
00:26:08,157 --> 00:26:11,126
Making music. Come sit down,
I wanna show you something.

250
00:26:17,099 --> 00:26:19,329
That's your basic
reggaeton beat.

251
00:26:19,502 --> 00:26:20,867
Okay.

252
00:26:24,073 --> 00:26:26,064
Yo, man,
how'd you get all this stuff?

253
00:26:26,242 --> 00:26:27,641
I broadcast music online.

254
00:26:28,144 --> 00:26:30,669
Oh, that's what's up.

255
00:26:32,348 --> 00:26:34,373
This is something
I've been working on.

256
00:26:40,122 --> 00:26:43,455
Okay. Okay.

257
00:26:49,498 --> 00:26:51,360
Slow it down a little bit.
Slow it down.

258
00:26:51,361 --> 00:26:51,966
No, no, no.

259
00:26:52,134 --> 00:26:55,433
The idea is to go the other way.
Otherwise you have hip-hop.

260
00:26:56,105 --> 00:26:57,129
- Okay.
- Yeah.

261
00:26:57,306 --> 00:26:58,967
- Okay. Okay.
- Keep going. Keep going.

262
00:26:59,141 --> 00:27:00,733
Okay.

263
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,172
Okay.

264
00:27:04,013 --> 00:27:06,504
- Sing. Come on.
- Okay. Okay.

265
00:27:16,158 --> 00:27:17,182
Your boy Rob.

266
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,734
Coming straight out of Harlem.

267
00:27:19,735 --> 00:27:20,921
Uptown, baby.

268
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:23,258
Uptown...

269
00:27:26,469 --> 00:27:28,334
Okay. Check it out, check it out.

270
00:27:28,504 --> 00:27:30,904
Yo, I'm trying to be
the Superman of the ghetto.

271
00:27:31,073 --> 00:27:33,735
Get this paper, take this music
to a whole other level.

272
00:27:33,909 --> 00:27:36,901
Trouble found me,
then I found myself in Puerto Rico.

273
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:38,740
That's why I got high,
I had to roll.

274
00:27:38,914 --> 00:27:40,313
- Something like that?
- Yeah.

275
00:27:40,483 --> 00:27:42,713
- Something like that?
- That's off the hook.

276
00:27:43,285 --> 00:27:45,014
Oh, yeah.

277
00:27:45,688 --> 00:27:48,851
We moved from New York
to Puerto Rico when I was 8.

278
00:27:49,025 --> 00:27:51,425
Anyway, I came here
to talk about personal business.

279
00:27:51,594 --> 00:27:52,925
- Oh, personal business?
- Yeah.

280
00:27:53,095 --> 00:27:54,824
Well, what personal business
is that?

281
00:27:54,997 --> 00:27:57,522
I actually plan on making it
to New York this summer...

282
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,065
...to study dance.

283
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:04,334
I have this application
that I need to correct.

284
00:28:04,507 --> 00:28:06,338
Can you do it for me?

285
00:28:07,243 --> 00:28:09,370
- It's in English.
- But your English is perfect.

286
00:28:09,545 --> 00:28:11,308
Spoken, not written.

287
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,151
It's not a lot.

288
00:28:12,152 --> 00:28:15,280
It's just a couple of pages and
you can just correct it as you go.

289
00:28:15,451 --> 00:28:16,611
Okay.

290
00:28:16,786 --> 00:28:20,119
So, what do I get out of this?

291
00:28:20,289 --> 00:28:22,257
Why do you have to get
something out of it?

292
00:28:22,425 --> 00:28:25,519
Well, I mean, usually I charge a fee,
but, you know...

293
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:30,624
I can give you
my lucky-charm bracelet.

294
00:28:34,704 --> 00:28:36,331
- Hey. What's up?
- Play this.

295
00:28:36,505 --> 00:28:38,336
- Hey, what's up, man?
- What is it?

296
00:28:38,507 --> 00:28:41,135
- I'm not gonna mess up your date.
- Okay.

297
00:28:49,485 --> 00:28:50,747
Were you recording?

298
00:28:51,987 --> 00:28:53,579
This is you?

299
00:29:00,229 --> 00:29:01,594
This is crazy.

300
00:29:01,764 --> 00:29:04,961
This is real hot.
You guys need to record this.

301
00:29:05,134 --> 00:29:07,285
My neighbor has his own studio.

302
00:29:07,286 --> 00:29:09,298
I can call him if you want.

303
00:29:12,341 --> 00:29:13,706
- That would be dope.
- Okay.

304
00:29:13,876 --> 00:29:16,538
- All right.
- Bye.

305
00:30:29,418 --> 00:30:30,976
What have you been up to?

306
00:30:32,855 --> 00:30:35,619
- I'm sorry, what did you say?
- What have you been up to?

307
00:30:35,791 --> 00:30:36,883
Well, nothing.

308
00:30:37,326 --> 00:30:40,295
Did you happen to see anyone
hanging around the house today?

309
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:43,021
No. Why?

310
00:30:43,199 --> 00:30:45,224
Someone stole
Marivi's engagement ring.

311
00:30:47,269 --> 00:30:49,794
No, I haven't seen anybody
around here today.

312
00:30:50,773 --> 00:30:52,604
It meant a lot to her.

313
00:30:53,442 --> 00:30:55,410
It meant a lot to me too.

314
00:31:05,988 --> 00:31:08,923
- Hey, Rosie.
- Thank you, C.C.

315
00:31:10,726 --> 00:31:12,717
Excuse me.
Can I ask you a question?

316
00:31:12,895 --> 00:31:16,262
I was wondering... I saw you
at the club, and you dance great.

317
00:31:16,432 --> 00:31:19,060
- Man, you've got some great moves.
- Thank you. Thank you.

318
00:31:19,235 --> 00:31:20,395
- What's your name?
- C.C.

319
00:31:20,569 --> 00:31:23,003
- I'm Jeffrey. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

320
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:26,573
I was wondering if you'd ever consider
taking on, like, private clients.

321
00:31:26,742 --> 00:31:29,074
I would have to check.
I don't think they allow it.

322
00:31:29,245 --> 00:31:32,373
I'd be willing to pay handsomely
and make it worth your while.

323
00:31:33,449 --> 00:31:35,644
- I'll look into it.
- Okay. Will you take a card?

324
00:31:35,818 --> 00:31:37,718
- Sure.
- Maybe call me?

325
00:31:40,256 --> 00:31:41,382
- Okay.
- Nice to meet you.

326
00:31:41,557 --> 00:31:43,081
Nice to meet you.

327
00:31:53,235 --> 00:31:55,328
I'm not feeling it.
I don't like it.

328
00:31:55,504 --> 00:31:57,665
No. Look, try it like this:

329
00:32:00,442 --> 00:32:02,637
- Know what I'm saying?
- That's too much hip-hop.

330
00:32:02,811 --> 00:32:05,405
What? That's how all the best
hip-hop records were made.

331
00:32:05,581 --> 00:32:07,606
That's the point.
It's not supposed to sound like that.

332
00:32:07,783 --> 00:32:09,751
Look, man, just try it.
Just check it out.

333
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,614
You check it out.

334
00:32:12,655 --> 00:32:14,953
Yo, why you being
all stubborn for, man?

335
00:32:15,124 --> 00:32:17,456
Just try it.

336
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:30,330
Yo, look, man, I'm not trying
to battle with you, okay?

337
00:32:30,506 --> 00:32:33,168
But if we gonna make music,
we gotta make music as a team.

338
00:32:33,342 --> 00:32:36,209
How we do music if you wanna do
one thing, I wanna do another?

339
00:32:36,378 --> 00:32:38,278
- You tell me.
- What are you talking about?

340
00:32:38,447 --> 00:32:41,007
- I'm doing hip-hop.
- We're in Puerto Rico, not New York.

341
00:32:41,183 --> 00:32:42,650
We don't do hip-hop,
we do reggaeton.

342
00:32:42,818 --> 00:32:45,446
I like 50 Cent
and Snoop Doggy Dogg.

343
00:32:46,522 --> 00:32:50,014
Okay, yeah, and I like Daddy Yankee
and what is his name? Pitbull.

344
00:32:50,192 --> 00:32:52,251
- That's not the point.
- That's not the point.

345
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:53,827
I swear...

346
00:32:59,802 --> 00:33:00,962
Yo, you hear that?

347
00:33:04,173 --> 00:33:05,902
Yo, you hear that?

348
00:33:07,343 --> 00:33:09,174
What...? Yo, what's that?

349
00:33:13,248 --> 00:33:15,580
A frog, the coqui.

350
00:33:17,319 --> 00:33:18,513
I like that sound, man.

351
00:33:19,021 --> 00:33:21,182
Might wanna use that,
you know what I'm saying?

352
00:33:21,423 --> 00:33:23,653
Like in a song or something.

353
00:33:23,826 --> 00:33:24,918
Yeah, yeah.

354
00:33:25,728 --> 00:33:27,252
- No, no, no.
- What?

355
00:33:29,331 --> 00:33:30,992
Okay, okay, okay.

356
00:33:32,034 --> 00:33:34,002
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

357
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:19,647
- Hello. Yo.
- Are you there?

358
00:34:19,815 --> 00:34:21,612
- Rob?
- Yeah.

359
00:34:21,784 --> 00:34:24,252
- What's good?
- Nothing, I just wanted to call you...

360
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:27,480
...and say thank you for correcting
my paper. Thank you.

361
00:34:27,656 --> 00:34:29,556
- It's no problem.
- I spoke to my friend...

362
00:34:29,725 --> 00:34:31,056
...about using the studio.

363
00:34:31,226 --> 00:34:34,957
- I think I can get that for you guys.
- Oh, thanks. Appreciate that.

364
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:37,860
I'll get in contact with him
and let you guys know, okay?

365
00:34:38,033 --> 00:34:39,796
All right.

366
00:34:39,968 --> 00:34:41,230
Peace.

367
00:34:41,737 --> 00:34:43,568
Talking to her, right?

368
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:46,105
That's her? You talking to her?

369
00:34:46,275 --> 00:34:48,835
I'm talking to none of your
damn business, that's who.

370
00:34:49,011 --> 00:34:50,444
- Not my business?
- Yeah.

371
00:34:50,612 --> 00:34:53,376
Everything around here
is my business, negro pendejo.

372
00:34:54,216 --> 00:34:56,013
Say what? Say what?

373
00:34:59,254 --> 00:35:01,017
I know where you live.

374
00:35:02,324 --> 00:35:05,760
I know where you live. I know where
your parents work, you'll see.

375
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:08,158
You'll see,
I'm going to kill them all.

376
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:09,319
Whatever, man.

377
00:35:09,498 --> 00:35:11,159
Stupid...

378
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:19,207
You understand
what they're saying?

379
00:35:19,374 --> 00:35:22,036
No. Don't know.

380
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:26,241
It's that today is la conmemoracion
del Estado Libre Asociado.

381
00:35:27,783 --> 00:35:30,650
It's Constitution Day.

382
00:35:30,819 --> 00:35:32,116
Oh, okay.

383
00:35:32,287 --> 00:35:35,120
But I thought Puerto Rico
was, like, a colonized country.

384
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:36,314
Something like that.

385
00:35:36,492 --> 00:35:39,928
It is. We're the oldest colony
in the world.

386
00:35:40,095 --> 00:35:41,289
Well, that's easy to say.

387
00:35:41,463 --> 00:35:44,523
We have no natural resources.
Tourism is it.

388
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,668
What about reggaeton
and sugar?

389
00:35:46,835 --> 00:35:50,066
The truth is, we know we can't be
a dependent country forever.

390
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:53,037
The economy is broke anyway,
so something has to happen.

391
00:35:53,208 --> 00:35:55,642
To that day, salud.

392
00:36:01,283 --> 00:36:03,945
- You hear anything about the ring?
- No. Not yet.

393
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:06,110
I'm sure it's somewhere.

394
00:36:06,288 --> 00:36:09,724
Ma, you're always losing something
and then you find it.

395
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:13,856
He's speaking the truth.

396
00:36:16,198 --> 00:36:18,291
I hear you're working on a song.

397
00:36:19,735 --> 00:36:23,000
- We are.
- What is it?

398
00:36:24,873 --> 00:36:27,842
Well, you know,
it's a little bit of everything.

399
00:36:29,611 --> 00:36:31,135
You wanna hear it?

400
00:36:31,313 --> 00:36:33,213
No, no.
Not while we're eating dinner.

401
00:36:33,582 --> 00:36:35,209
Maybe later.

402
00:36:56,705 --> 00:36:58,104
How you doing?

403
00:37:01,376 --> 00:37:03,674
Just working on my music.

404
00:37:07,216 --> 00:37:10,549
I know we haven't had a chance
to talk about things.

405
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:12,346
About us.

406
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:14,352
Well, you don't have to.

407
00:37:15,991 --> 00:37:17,652
I just...

408
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:20,525
I just want you to know...

409
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:23,358
...that I always
thought about you.

410
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:30,570
I know it's not fair for me
to try to be a father...

411
00:37:30,739 --> 00:37:32,502
...after all these years, but...

412
00:37:32,674 --> 00:37:34,141
So don't.

413
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:37,975
It's not what you think.

414
00:37:39,014 --> 00:37:41,073
Look, who cares now?

415
00:37:42,684 --> 00:37:44,618
- You have to know, son.
- No, I don't.

416
00:37:44,786 --> 00:37:46,117
L...

417
00:37:48,657 --> 00:37:50,181
No, I don't.

418
00:38:16,952 --> 00:38:19,352
I never thought I'd see the day
I'd be getting money.

419
00:38:19,521 --> 00:38:21,785
Making music so haters
can't take nothing from me.

420
00:38:21,957 --> 00:38:24,118
When chicks wouldn't holler
I'd just play back.

421
00:38:24,359 --> 00:38:26,350
All I had was a flow and a ball cap.

422
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:29,029
Wall to wall, boom, boom
across the room.

423
00:38:29,197 --> 00:38:31,165
Thinking they'd be
dancing to me soon.

424
00:38:31,333 --> 00:38:33,460
I'm in the game but I'm still
in the streets.

425
00:38:33,635 --> 00:38:35,728
Prepped for Harlem
and Puerto Rico.

426
00:38:35,904 --> 00:38:40,398
Puerto Rico, Puerto Rico.
Puerto Rico, Puerto Rico.

427
00:38:40,575 --> 00:38:42,475
Puerto Rico.

428
00:38:51,386 --> 00:38:54,685
That was hot. You guys make
a crazy team together.

429
00:38:54,856 --> 00:38:55,982
Oh, thanks.

430
00:38:56,158 --> 00:38:58,518
We appreciate, you know what I'm saying?

431
00:38:58,519 --> 00:39:00,288
The recording spot. Thanks.

432
00:39:00,462 --> 00:39:02,521
You're welcome. Where's Javi?

433
00:39:02,698 --> 00:39:06,293
Oh, he had to run some errands.
Yeah.

434
00:39:07,336 --> 00:39:08,735
So...

435
00:39:09,471 --> 00:39:11,132
...what you wanna do?

436
00:39:12,574 --> 00:39:15,566
Do you know a place
where we can go get some drinks?

437
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,720
You know, there's a place like this
in New York.

438
00:39:27,889 --> 00:39:30,414
Or New York
is just like this place.

439
00:39:30,592 --> 00:39:34,824
Looks like in Puerto Rico,
you can go all day and all night.

440
00:39:37,699 --> 00:39:39,758
Do you dance to this music?

441
00:39:40,435 --> 00:39:42,164
No, not really.

442
00:39:43,372 --> 00:39:45,704
- Why are you laughing?
- Why not?

443
00:39:45,874 --> 00:39:49,071
- Because I don't dance, you know?
- I'll show you. Come on.

444
00:40:39,928 --> 00:40:41,792
- Welcome back.
- Yeah, I'll be right back.

445
00:40:41,963 --> 00:40:43,658
Don't go too far.

446
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:56,807
Hi. How are you?

447
00:40:56,978 --> 00:40:58,090
Very good. How are you?

448
00:40:58,091 --> 00:41:00,004
I'm just waiting
for my class to start.

449
00:41:00,182 --> 00:41:01,706
This must be fate.

450
00:41:02,484 --> 00:41:03,508
Yeah.

451
00:41:03,685 --> 00:41:06,210
I'm waiting too, you know,
for that phone call. So?

452
00:41:06,388 --> 00:41:07,764
I asked, and we're just...

453
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:08,982
We're not allowed to.

454
00:41:09,157 --> 00:41:11,057
- Really?
- Yeah.

455
00:41:11,226 --> 00:41:13,057
- Okay, well...
- What are you...?

456
00:41:13,228 --> 00:41:16,095
Just down here scouting talent.

457
00:41:16,898 --> 00:41:19,924
- You don't happen to sing, do you?
- No. I don't sing.

458
00:41:20,101 --> 00:41:23,161
But I have some friends
that are really talented.

459
00:41:23,338 --> 00:41:24,779
Really? I'd love to hear them.

460
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:26,671
I can get you their
music if you want.

461
00:41:27,242 --> 00:41:29,142
That'd be great.
That'd be excellent.

462
00:41:29,311 --> 00:41:31,973
Okay. How long
are you in town for?

463
00:41:32,147 --> 00:41:34,741
- Just a couple more days.
- Okay. We'll talk.

464
00:41:34,916 --> 00:41:35,905
- Call me?
- Yeah.

465
00:41:36,084 --> 00:41:37,126
I've heard that before.

466
00:41:37,127 --> 00:41:38,712
If you don't call, I'll call you?

467
00:41:38,887 --> 00:41:40,115
Bye.

468
00:41:47,829 --> 00:41:50,059
So I heard
you had a date last night.

469
00:41:53,735 --> 00:41:56,329
- How did it go?
- It was cool.

470
00:41:56,505 --> 00:41:58,837
We went to the club, chilled...

471
00:41:59,007 --> 00:42:01,032
...you know,
danced and stuff like that.

472
00:42:01,209 --> 00:42:03,040
It was cool. I enjoyed myself.

473
00:42:03,578 --> 00:42:06,172
So do you like
the music here, or...?

474
00:42:06,348 --> 00:42:08,509
Oh, yeah, yeah,
the music is real different.

475
00:42:08,683 --> 00:42:10,776
- I like it.
- Marivi.

476
00:42:14,155 --> 00:42:15,520
Ready?

477
00:42:16,858 --> 00:42:19,018
Okay, I'll see you at home.

478
00:42:24,064 --> 00:42:26,726
See, yo, I don't know nothing
you just said, man.

479
00:42:26,901 --> 00:42:28,391
Talking in Spanish.

480
00:42:49,723 --> 00:42:51,953
Come home soon
because I'm going to cook.

481
00:42:52,226 --> 00:42:53,784
- Really?
- Yes.

482
00:42:53,994 --> 00:42:56,326
Well, then I'll run home.

483
00:43:09,543 --> 00:43:11,568
Give me another beer.

484
00:43:19,853 --> 00:43:23,721
The total is $ 15,
including this one.

485
00:43:28,429 --> 00:43:30,693
Hey, I said it's $ 15!

486
00:43:31,131 --> 00:43:33,964
I already heard you.

487
00:43:46,213 --> 00:43:47,207
Can you settle up?

488
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:49,307
It's just that I'm about to close...

489
00:43:49,483 --> 00:43:50,848
You will not close because...

490
00:43:51,018 --> 00:43:52,576
I put money in the jukebox...

491
00:43:52,753 --> 00:43:54,516
...I put money in the pool table.

492
00:43:54,688 --> 00:43:57,179
I'm having a drink,
and you're going to throw me out?

493
00:44:28,656 --> 00:44:31,318
- Can I get you something else?
- Margarita, please.

494
00:44:31,492 --> 00:44:33,084
Right away.

495
00:44:33,327 --> 00:44:34,692
This is really good.

496
00:45:19,807 --> 00:45:21,297
I'll be right back.

497
00:45:31,852 --> 00:45:35,117
You know, I never thought that
he would go after your family, Rob.

498
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:38,824
I'm so sorry.

499
00:45:42,429 --> 00:45:44,454
Look, don't worry about it.

500
00:45:46,366 --> 00:45:49,426
Marivi, she's gonna be okay.

501
00:45:50,471 --> 00:45:53,099
Plus, I know it wasn't your fault.

502
00:45:54,842 --> 00:45:56,707
You know what I'm saying?

503
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:02,608
I had some good news for you.

504
00:46:03,684 --> 00:46:06,312
The record producer that I met?

505
00:46:06,487 --> 00:46:07,920
He really liked your demo.

506
00:46:08,655 --> 00:46:10,680
Oh, yeah?

507
00:46:11,024 --> 00:46:12,889
Yeah.

508
00:46:20,334 --> 00:46:23,201
Look, I'm gonna get back inside
and see how she is.

509
00:46:23,370 --> 00:46:26,601
- See you later, all right?
- Okay. See you.

510
00:46:49,463 --> 00:46:51,226
Hey.

511
00:46:51,865 --> 00:46:54,026
I'm sorry, I didn't...

512
00:46:58,405 --> 00:47:00,134
Let's go outside.

513
00:47:05,312 --> 00:47:07,212
How is she?

514
00:47:07,381 --> 00:47:09,349
Yeah, she'll be okay.

515
00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:12,316
They're gonna
let her out tomorrow.

516
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:16,484
So, what's gonna happen
to the dude who did it?

517
00:47:16,657 --> 00:47:18,784
He'll be dealt with.

518
00:47:19,326 --> 00:47:23,228
Who? You or the man?

519
00:47:24,898 --> 00:47:28,026
There's a way of doing things
in our neighborhood.

520
00:47:29,369 --> 00:47:31,337
She was asking about you.

521
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:35,770
I didn't know if I should
come in there or not.

522
00:47:35,943 --> 00:47:38,241
I'm happy you did.

523
00:48:09,443 --> 00:48:11,741
- Hey, Vico.
- Vico.

524
00:48:11,912 --> 00:48:13,436
Hey, Vico.

525
00:48:24,124 --> 00:48:27,059
- Yo, Vico, where you going?
- The mayor has a message for you.

526
00:48:27,227 --> 00:48:29,195
- Vico.
- Around here, we don't hit no woman.

527
00:48:29,363 --> 00:48:31,558
- Vico.
- Yo, the mayor doesn't like that, man.

528
00:48:31,732 --> 00:48:34,462
- Beating up on women?
- What were you thinking, huh?

529
00:48:39,239 --> 00:48:41,298
You're not bigger.
The rules are the rules.

530
00:49:00,694 --> 00:49:02,321
So anyway,
as I was saying to C. C...

531
00:49:02,496 --> 00:49:04,225
...you put together
a kick-ass demo...

532
00:49:04,398 --> 00:49:07,834
...but I got a producer who's gonna
take you to the next level. All right?

533
00:49:08,001 --> 00:49:11,198
Okay. But we want to be able to do
our music the way we want to.

534
00:49:11,371 --> 00:49:13,566
Right. And the guy I got in mind,
he's the best.

535
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:16,072
Best producer in New York.
Peter Black is his name.

536
00:49:16,243 --> 00:49:18,677
Produced Usher, everybody.
And you're gonna love him.

537
00:49:19,479 --> 00:49:20,639
Gonna love him.

538
00:49:20,814 --> 00:49:23,146
Well, let me talk it over
with my business partner.

539
00:49:23,317 --> 00:49:26,775
You should. But you gotta do it quickly
because I gotta get out of town.

540
00:49:27,487 --> 00:49:29,921
- All right, cool.
- All right.

541
00:49:30,090 --> 00:49:31,819
- So you'll let me know?
- I will.

542
00:49:32,893 --> 00:49:34,793
Thank you for seeing us.
Take care.

543
00:49:34,962 --> 00:49:39,831
My pleasure. Thanks, C.C.
All right. I expect a call.

544
00:49:49,643 --> 00:49:50,701
So?

545
00:49:53,213 --> 00:49:54,976
I don't know.

546
00:49:55,148 --> 00:49:56,911
What do you mean
you don't know?

547
00:49:57,084 --> 00:49:59,211
Do you understand
what just happened here, Rob?

548
00:49:59,386 --> 00:50:00,729
I mean, I understand.

549
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:02,583
But I don't know if you do.

550
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:04,953
A record executive
just left here.

551
00:50:05,125 --> 00:50:07,650
Wants to cut your record,
you're talking about something else.

552
00:50:07,828 --> 00:50:09,261
Calm down, mama.
Calm down.

553
00:50:10,697 --> 00:50:14,565
Look, Robert,
I think she's right.

554
00:50:14,735 --> 00:50:16,168
What we have to lose?

555
00:50:24,678 --> 00:50:26,543
Yeah!

556
00:50:33,387 --> 00:50:35,855
So it's off to New York.

557
00:50:37,024 --> 00:50:38,548
Yeah, exactly what you wanted.

558
00:50:38,725 --> 00:50:41,751
Actually, it's even better.

559
00:50:41,928 --> 00:50:44,556
- Yeah, why?
- Because you're coming.

560
00:50:45,699 --> 00:50:48,133
Oh, and also because Jeffrey
wants to introduce me...

561
00:50:48,301 --> 00:50:51,566
...to some artist managers
that need dancers for music videos.

562
00:50:51,738 --> 00:50:52,762
Yeah, that's cool.

563
00:50:52,939 --> 00:50:54,964
- That's good, right?
- Yeah.

564
00:51:00,547 --> 00:51:02,344
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

565
00:51:02,516 --> 00:51:04,177
You sure?

566
00:51:11,124 --> 00:51:13,490
Okay, well...

567
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:16,561
...guess I'll talk to you later.
- Okay.

568
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:19,555
- Phone.
- Bye.

569
00:51:22,769 --> 00:51:24,293
Call you.

570
00:51:27,774 --> 00:51:31,733
Hi, Ma. So we got a producer
who wants to record us in New York.

571
00:51:31,912 --> 00:51:34,608
That's great. What about the guys
that are looking for you?

572
00:51:34,781 --> 00:51:38,308
The producer got us a place to stay
in Brooklyn, so he won't find me there.

573
00:51:38,485 --> 00:51:41,420
- I'll text you the address, all right?
- Okay.

574
00:51:41,588 --> 00:51:43,078
Meet me there. I love you.

575
00:51:43,256 --> 00:51:44,951
Love you too, babe.

576
00:51:56,369 --> 00:51:57,148
Hey, Robert.

577
00:51:57,149 --> 00:51:58,837
What are you doing here?

578
00:51:59,473 --> 00:52:01,031
Well...

579
00:52:03,677 --> 00:52:06,145
I came to tell you
that I'm leaving.

580
00:52:06,313 --> 00:52:09,612
What? You're leaving? Why?

581
00:52:09,783 --> 00:52:12,251
We got a gig back in New York.

582
00:52:12,419 --> 00:52:15,081
- You serious?
- Yeah.

583
00:52:15,255 --> 00:52:17,314
Congratulations.

584
00:52:22,729 --> 00:52:25,721
You know, I've been wanting
to talk to you for a long time.

585
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:29,561
Something I really need
to tell you.

586
00:52:31,738 --> 00:52:33,672
Have a drink with me.

587
00:52:46,286 --> 00:52:48,948
You know,
when I met your mother...

588
00:52:49,689 --> 00:52:52,089
...I was playing with a band
in New York.

589
00:52:54,127 --> 00:52:55,890
And I...

590
00:52:57,731 --> 00:53:01,098
I was a mess at that time.

591
00:53:01,568 --> 00:53:03,126
Booze...

592
00:53:03,603 --> 00:53:05,468
...drugs.

593
00:53:06,173 --> 00:53:09,006
We had our whole life
in front of us.

594
00:53:09,176 --> 00:53:11,110
One night, after the show...

595
00:53:11,278 --> 00:53:13,838
...Tanya was waiting for me
in the car with you.

596
00:53:14,314 --> 00:53:16,248
You were...

597
00:53:16,416 --> 00:53:18,680
You were just a baby then.

598
00:53:20,754 --> 00:53:25,623
And I got behind the wheel
and I was drunk.

599
00:53:25,792 --> 00:53:28,090
And we had a horrible accident.

600
00:53:28,528 --> 00:53:30,996
Now, thank God we survived.

601
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:35,825
Tanya didn't wanna speak to me
after that.

602
00:53:36,002 --> 00:53:38,095
She asked me to leave.

603
00:53:38,738 --> 00:53:41,536
So I came down here
to start over.

604
00:53:42,576 --> 00:53:45,739
And I was calling her
and calling her...

605
00:53:45,912 --> 00:53:48,210
...but she had disappeared
with you.

606
00:53:51,318 --> 00:53:53,878
I couldn't play music after that.

607
00:53:55,222 --> 00:53:57,315
And I never again
returned to New York.

608
00:54:08,735 --> 00:54:11,499
It's still all about you.

609
00:54:15,208 --> 00:54:18,143
You know,
it's always been about you.

610
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:23,507
Look, as far as I'm concerned,
I didn't have a father.

611
00:54:24,751 --> 00:54:28,551
And now all of a sudden
you and my mom decide that I do?

612
00:54:33,693 --> 00:54:37,652
You know, man, maybe if you hadn't
abandoned us in the first place...

613
00:54:37,831 --> 00:54:40,387
...I wouldn't have ended up like this.

614
00:54:40,388 --> 00:54:41,597
Hiding, running.

615
00:54:42,969 --> 00:54:45,597
I'm supposed to be dead.

616
00:54:47,707 --> 00:54:50,267
Robert, I am so sorry.

617
00:54:50,443 --> 00:54:52,240
Just forget it, man.

618
00:55:13,867 --> 00:55:16,631
So I guess
you'll be leaving us soon.

619
00:55:16,803 --> 00:55:18,464
Yeah.

620
00:55:19,706 --> 00:55:21,469
That's too bad.

621
00:55:22,709 --> 00:55:25,610
Well, I just wanted to tell you
that I really appreciate you...

622
00:55:25,779 --> 00:55:28,805
...you know, allowing me
to stay here and all.

623
00:55:28,982 --> 00:55:32,110
And I'm really sorry
about the trouble and stuff.

624
00:55:32,686 --> 00:55:34,347
It's okay.

625
00:55:37,023 --> 00:55:40,686
Look, before you go,
something I wanna show you.

626
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:43,294
Go in that box, in the corner.

627
00:55:44,364 --> 00:55:45,922
This one?

628
00:55:48,101 --> 00:55:49,762
Sit down.

629
00:55:57,711 --> 00:55:59,178
These are yours.

630
00:56:05,018 --> 00:56:06,952
Your father
always looks at those...

631
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:09,748
...every time your birthday
comes around.

632
00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:12,187
September 28th, right?

633
00:56:15,995 --> 00:56:17,587
What's wrong?

634
00:56:36,783 --> 00:56:39,809
I mean, I wasn't gonna
sell it or anything.

635
00:56:39,986 --> 00:56:42,853
I don't know
why I took it. I just...

636
00:56:43,323 --> 00:56:45,052
I'm sorry.

637
00:56:50,597 --> 00:56:52,292
Don't worry.

638
00:56:53,032 --> 00:56:55,330
I'll just tell him
I found it somewhere.

639
00:56:58,605 --> 00:57:00,766
You have every right
to feel the way you do...

640
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:02,805
...but just so you know...

641
00:57:02,976 --> 00:57:05,740
...he was so happy to see you.

642
00:57:26,499 --> 00:57:28,592
Take care of yourself, okay?

643
00:57:29,536 --> 00:57:31,697
- Do you have your tickets?
- Yeah, I think so.

644
00:57:31,871 --> 00:57:33,839
Do you have
everything you need?

645
00:57:35,442 --> 00:57:36,636
Take it easy.

646
00:57:38,244 --> 00:57:39,905
All right.

647
00:57:44,017 --> 00:57:45,348
Let's go to New York.

648
00:57:45,685 --> 00:57:48,313
- Take care of them.
- Okay.

649
00:57:50,623 --> 00:57:52,454
Listen to it, okay?

650
00:57:56,296 --> 00:57:57,820
Okay.

651
00:57:57,997 --> 00:58:01,728
And make sure you clap
when the plane lands. It's tradition.

652
00:58:11,010 --> 00:58:13,444
Man, it feels good to be home.

653
00:58:15,815 --> 00:58:17,214
What up, New York?

654
00:58:23,389 --> 00:58:26,085
Yo, man, look at this.
This is dope.

655
00:58:26,259 --> 00:58:28,489
Man, this is crazy.

656
00:58:29,429 --> 00:58:31,693
I told you guys
Jeffrey was gonna hook us up.

657
00:58:31,865 --> 00:58:35,528
Well, I hope this place
comes with a cleaning lady.

658
00:58:48,715 --> 00:58:49,739
- What's good?
- Hey.

659
00:58:49,916 --> 00:58:52,441
I'm saying let's go out.
Let's go out and celebrate.

660
00:58:52,619 --> 00:58:54,883
Hey, man, why don't you come
soup your boy up?

661
00:59:04,731 --> 00:59:07,256
Yo, have you spoken to your ex
since you got back?

662
00:59:07,867 --> 00:59:09,528
No.

663
00:59:10,236 --> 00:59:12,170
You still think about her?

664
00:59:12,338 --> 00:59:16,741
I mean, from time to time,
but, I mean, you see what I got.

665
00:59:19,379 --> 00:59:22,712
Hey, she got that spice, son.
For real.

666
00:59:22,882 --> 00:59:24,679
Don't let it happen again,
my nigga.

667
00:59:24,851 --> 00:59:27,012
You talking about
the falling-in-love thing?

668
00:59:27,186 --> 00:59:30,622
Never. Never.

669
00:59:32,625 --> 00:59:34,593
You wanna dance?

670
00:59:36,195 --> 00:59:39,028
Never. Never.

671
01:00:56,609 --> 01:01:00,170
So, what do you think?
It's got a layer of African fusion.

672
01:01:00,346 --> 01:01:03,008
I mean, I don't mind
combining it with something else...

673
01:01:03,182 --> 01:01:05,514
...I just wasn't too crazy about that,
you know?

674
01:01:05,685 --> 01:01:08,848
Yeah, I think the boys were hoping
to stick to the original beat.

675
01:01:09,022 --> 01:01:10,046
Is that right, guys?

676
01:01:10,223 --> 01:01:13,351
- Did you at least listen to our demo?
- What demo?

677
01:01:13,526 --> 01:01:14,908
The one sent from the office.

678
01:01:14,909 --> 01:01:16,051
They didn't send that?

679
01:01:16,229 --> 01:01:17,856
- No.
- You gotta be kidding me.

680
01:01:18,031 --> 01:01:20,124
Javi, do you got
some music on you?

681
01:01:20,299 --> 01:01:21,789
Yeah.

682
01:01:22,402 --> 01:01:23,892
All right.

683
01:01:44,190 --> 01:01:46,249
All right, all right.
I can work with this.

684
01:01:46,426 --> 01:01:47,422
Well, all right, then.

685
01:01:47,423 --> 01:01:48,917
You kids can take it from here.

686
01:01:49,095 --> 01:01:52,861
- Absolutely.
- C.C., let's jet.

687
01:01:54,367 --> 01:01:55,391
Where you going?

688
01:01:55,568 --> 01:01:58,401
He's gonna introduce me
to some artists for a music video.

689
01:01:58,571 --> 01:02:01,039
- We'll do something tonight, all right?
- All right.

690
01:02:01,207 --> 01:02:02,936
- See what you can do.
- No, I got it.

691
01:02:03,109 --> 01:02:04,133
It's gonna be great.

692
01:02:04,310 --> 01:02:06,676
- Be back later, all right?
- Yeah.

693
01:02:06,846 --> 01:02:08,336
Bye.

694
01:02:27,834 --> 01:02:29,358
Bye.

695
01:02:38,611 --> 01:02:41,239
- Hey, baby.
- There she is.

696
01:02:46,552 --> 01:02:48,611
- What's going on?
- What do you mean?

697
01:02:48,788 --> 01:02:51,086
You know exactly what I mean.
You're acting weird.

698
01:02:52,892 --> 01:02:54,757
Did I do something?

699
01:02:56,129 --> 01:02:58,256
I don't know, you tell me.

700
01:02:59,999 --> 01:03:02,413
Look, I thought we
had plans tonight.

701
01:03:02,414 --> 01:03:03,457
Like, tonight.

702
01:03:03,636 --> 01:03:05,035
Rob, look, I'm sorry.

703
01:03:05,204 --> 01:03:08,105
Jeffrey took me around everywhere,
and my battery died today...

704
01:03:08,274 --> 01:03:11,607
Oh, come on, man. Look, I understand
you gotta go out, do your thing...

705
01:03:11,778 --> 01:03:13,769
...but it's the way
you doing your thing.

706
01:03:13,946 --> 01:03:16,938
Using what you got
to get to the next level.

707
01:03:20,253 --> 01:03:21,811
- So you have a good time?
- What?

708
01:03:21,988 --> 01:03:24,354
- You and Jeffrey.
- You don't know a thing about me.

709
01:03:24,524 --> 01:03:26,458
All I know
is what you told me, okay?

710
01:03:26,626 --> 01:03:28,958
How you always
wanna get what you want.

711
01:03:29,128 --> 01:03:32,564
Fuck you. 
I don't need this.

712
01:03:37,036 --> 01:03:38,697
Damn it.

713
01:03:42,008 --> 01:03:43,976
Where to, miss?

714
01:03:44,310 --> 01:03:47,040
I'm going to Manhattan,
240 Central Park West.

715
01:03:47,213 --> 01:03:48,874
Okay.

716
01:04:06,098 --> 01:04:07,998
I'm glad you called.

717
01:04:10,736 --> 01:04:12,101
So this is my apartment.

718
01:04:12,405 --> 01:04:15,033
- It's nice.
- Thank you.

719
01:04:15,208 --> 01:04:18,041
Can I get you a drink, or do
you wanna talk about anything?

720
01:04:18,211 --> 01:04:20,975
No, thank you. I just...

721
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:23,507
- I'd rather just go to sleep.
- You sure?

722
01:04:23,683 --> 01:04:25,344
- Yeah.
- Okay.

723
01:04:25,751 --> 01:04:27,912
Well, let me show you
where you're going.

724
01:04:28,087 --> 01:04:29,418
You can stay down here.

725
01:04:29,589 --> 01:04:32,683
You got fresh sheets and towels
and a bathroom back here.

726
01:04:32,859 --> 01:04:34,292
You can make yourself at home.

727
01:04:36,796 --> 01:04:38,127
Let me try this.

728
01:04:40,099 --> 01:04:42,397
Now it's better. Yeah.

729
01:04:54,447 --> 01:04:57,245
- Hi, boys.
- You guys know Noelia, right?

730
01:04:57,416 --> 01:04:59,748
She's got an amazing voice.

731
01:04:59,919 --> 01:05:02,547
Jeffrey asked me to have her
sing the hook on your song.

732
01:05:02,822 --> 01:05:04,653
- What?
- No, no, no. No way.

733
01:05:04,824 --> 01:05:07,622
Yo, look, my man,
we've been talking to you all day.

734
01:05:07,793 --> 01:05:10,057
Those are not even the tracks
that we gave you.

735
01:05:10,229 --> 01:05:12,959
Now you asking us to incorporate
somebody on our hook?

736
01:05:13,132 --> 01:05:16,101
We need something commercial,
something people already know.

737
01:05:16,269 --> 01:05:18,237
- People are tired of the same old.
- Yeah.

738
01:05:18,404 --> 01:05:20,634
We were brought here
to make our music.

739
01:05:20,806 --> 01:05:24,105
- We are making your music.
- No, we're making your music.

740
01:05:24,277 --> 01:05:27,405
You know what? If you don't like it,
you know where the door is.

741
01:05:27,947 --> 01:05:30,438
- Come on, come on.
- Okay, okay, stop. Take it easy.

742
01:05:30,616 --> 01:05:32,106
Come on.

743
01:05:33,085 --> 01:05:34,882
We are going
to lose the deal, man.

744
01:05:35,054 --> 01:05:37,921
Look, man, I understand
that this is a great opportunity...

745
01:05:38,090 --> 01:05:39,887
...but I'm not feeling this, man.

746
01:05:40,059 --> 01:05:41,424
Damn, we're so close.

747
01:05:41,594 --> 01:05:43,118
Close to what, Javi?

748
01:05:43,296 --> 01:05:45,093
That music in there was wack.

749
01:05:45,264 --> 01:05:47,212
And we can't do it like this.

750
01:05:47,213 --> 01:05:49,564
This is not how dreams come true.

751
01:05:49,769 --> 01:05:52,932
If we gonna do it,
we gotta do it our way.

752
01:05:54,073 --> 01:05:55,514
Let me deal with it.

753
01:05:55,515 --> 01:05:57,099
All right, whatever.

754
01:05:57,276 --> 01:05:58,800
Yeah, bye.

755
01:05:58,978 --> 01:06:00,878
What happened?

756
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:04,449
Your friends just quit.

757
01:06:08,521 --> 01:06:10,250
Don't worry about it.

758
01:06:11,324 --> 01:06:15,556
Anyway, I invited some artists
over for cocktails.

759
01:06:16,996 --> 01:06:20,022
But why? That's all I'm asking.
Why would you quit?

760
01:06:20,199 --> 01:06:21,962
Ma, they was messing up
the music.

761
01:06:22,134 --> 01:06:23,998
But these people are professionals.

762
01:06:23,999 --> 01:06:25,968
Maybe they were trying to help you.

763
01:06:26,706 --> 01:06:28,435
Look, don't worry.

764
01:06:28,607 --> 01:06:30,541
I'm not gonna be like dad.

765
01:06:32,845 --> 01:06:34,540
What do you mean?

766
01:06:34,714 --> 01:06:36,204
He told me what happened.

767
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:39,650
Don't worry, Ma.

768
01:06:40,586 --> 01:06:42,349
I understand.

769
01:06:43,022 --> 01:06:44,751
You do?

770
01:06:51,797 --> 01:06:54,994
- I love you, Ma.
- I love you too, son.

771
01:06:55,167 --> 01:06:57,135
New Yorkers are preparing
for the annual...

772
01:06:57,303 --> 01:06:59,066
...Puerto Rican Day parade
this Sunday.

773
01:06:59,238 --> 01:07:01,706
Many of our local celebrities
will be attending.

774
01:07:01,874 --> 01:07:05,207
Some of Puerto Rico's greatest
reggaeton artists will be performing...

775
01:07:05,378 --> 01:07:10,111
...such as Voltio, Alexis Y Fido,
Calle 13 and others.

776
01:07:10,282 --> 01:07:13,342
In other news, the weather
in New York has been hitting highs...

777
01:07:13,519 --> 01:07:15,510
...and the beaches
have been very crowded.

778
01:07:16,122 --> 01:07:17,384
Please stay tuned for...

779
01:08:28,527 --> 01:08:31,724
Pay attention to what these guys
are doing, what she's doing.

780
01:08:31,897 --> 01:08:33,489
So when you make
your own record...

781
01:08:33,666 --> 01:08:36,635
...you'll be more familiar
with the process, okay?

782
01:08:38,370 --> 01:08:40,304
But I don't wanna be a singer.

783
01:08:40,473 --> 01:08:42,532
What do you mean
you don't wanna be a singer?

784
01:08:42,708 --> 01:08:45,336
Come on. That's what they 
all say in the beginning.

785
01:08:45,511 --> 01:08:47,479
You'll be a great singer.

786
01:08:49,515 --> 01:08:52,541
- What?
- Nothing.

787
01:08:56,288 --> 01:08:57,312
I'll be right back.

788
01:08:57,490 --> 01:08:58,423
Where you going?

789
01:08:58,424 --> 01:09:00,653
Just to the ladies'
room. I'll be back.

790
01:09:16,509 --> 01:09:18,500
Oh, what am I doing?

791
01:09:24,617 --> 01:09:27,051
Yo, man,
I wanna know where she at.

792
01:09:27,953 --> 01:09:30,080
Does she know anyone here?

793
01:09:30,356 --> 01:09:33,917
No, I don't think so,
I mean, Jeffrey.

794
01:09:35,728 --> 01:09:37,059
What a prick, man.

795
01:09:37,229 --> 01:09:39,823
I'm so glad we didn't sign anything
before coming here.

796
01:09:39,999 --> 01:09:42,058
- It was a good move.
- Word.

797
01:09:48,307 --> 01:09:50,275
What's up, beautiful?

798
01:09:50,442 --> 01:09:52,535
Do you need a ride, mommy?

799
01:09:52,845 --> 01:09:54,938
Tell that kid of yours
we wanna talk to him.

800
01:09:55,114 --> 01:09:57,582
Tell him Electric
wants to talk to him.

801
01:09:57,750 --> 01:10:00,446
Tonight, 9:00.

802
01:10:00,753 --> 01:10:01,981
Remember...

803
01:10:02,154 --> 01:10:05,055
...we know where to find you
in case he forgets to show up.

804
01:10:05,558 --> 01:10:07,389
You got that?

805
01:10:13,632 --> 01:10:14,963
Let the cops deal with it.

806
01:10:15,134 --> 01:10:17,625
Ma, the cops don't care
nothing about this.

807
01:10:18,304 --> 01:10:21,102
- To them, I'm one less nigger.
- Watch your mouth.

808
01:10:21,273 --> 01:10:22,831
I know these dudes.

809
01:10:23,008 --> 01:10:25,533
They gonna keep messing with me,
keep looking for me.

810
01:10:25,711 --> 01:10:28,908
You are on probation.
I won't be able to get you out of jail.

811
01:10:29,248 --> 01:10:31,808
Look, I'm not running no more.

812
01:10:35,554 --> 01:10:37,818
I ain't running no more.

813
01:10:58,744 --> 01:11:03,477
Dear C. C., I just wanted
to apologize for what I said to you.

814
01:11:10,089 --> 01:11:13,820
I just... I think I'm drunk.

815
01:11:14,426 --> 01:11:17,122
- You think?
- I think.

816
01:11:17,630 --> 01:11:18,619
- Really?
- Yeah.

817
01:11:19,832 --> 01:11:20,958
Yeah.

818
01:11:21,133 --> 01:11:24,000
- Can I tell you a secret?
- What?

819
01:11:24,169 --> 01:11:26,535
You're so beautiful.

820
01:11:28,540 --> 01:11:30,565
You're... God, you're...

821
01:11:30,743 --> 01:11:34,144
You're handsome too, and...

822
01:11:36,915 --> 01:11:39,850
And what? What?

823
01:11:40,019 --> 01:11:42,317
- I don't know.
- Old?

824
01:11:42,488 --> 01:11:46,049
No. I wasn't gonna say that.

825
01:11:46,225 --> 01:11:48,056
What were you gonna say?

826
01:11:51,463 --> 01:11:52,828
I don't know.

827
01:11:55,534 --> 01:11:57,627
I don't know, I...

828
01:11:58,504 --> 01:12:03,373
Well, I'm just trying to tell you
how special you are.

829
01:12:03,542 --> 01:12:06,943
I want you to know that, okay?
And talented.

830
01:12:07,112 --> 01:12:09,376
I mean, you...
You have a bright future...

831
01:12:09,548 --> 01:12:11,413
...and you can do
anything you want.

832
01:12:11,583 --> 01:12:14,347
Dancing, sing if you want.

833
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:17,318
You can have anything you want.

834
01:12:20,592 --> 01:12:23,823
You got something... 
Pardon me.

835
01:12:30,769 --> 01:12:32,999
I don't feel well.

836
01:12:46,585 --> 01:12:48,849
The producers, they screwed us.

837
01:12:48,850 --> 01:12:51,113
They're messing up the music.

838
01:12:52,891 --> 01:12:54,051
L... We have no money...

839
01:12:54,226 --> 01:12:56,285
...and I can't stay with Tanya
for too long.

840
01:12:57,663 --> 01:12:58,687
I'll take care of it.

841
01:13:00,466 --> 01:13:01,728
Hello?

842
01:13:01,967 --> 01:13:03,434
- Hello? Hello?
- Hello?

843
01:13:03,736 --> 01:13:04,862
Hello?

844
01:13:05,471 --> 01:13:06,495
Hello?

845
01:13:09,742 --> 01:13:12,233
Right then,
you know what I'm saying...?

846
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:24,488
- Yo, yo, yo.
- Oh, he there?

847
01:13:24,656 --> 01:13:26,521
- That's him, right?
- That's the kid, son.

848
01:13:26,692 --> 01:13:28,421
That's it?

849
01:13:28,594 --> 01:13:31,563
Yo, yo, yo, keep it low,
keep it low, keep it low.

850
01:13:31,964 --> 01:13:34,262
What I gotta do
to make this right, man?

851
01:13:34,433 --> 01:13:38,597
- All right. You pick one of my boys...
- This clown right here.

852
01:13:38,771 --> 01:13:41,934
...fight them, shoot a fair one,
then we done.

853
01:13:46,779 --> 01:13:48,474
Hey.

854
01:13:49,515 --> 01:13:53,144
- What are you doing here?
- I wanted to make sure you feel okay.

855
01:13:54,319 --> 01:13:57,516
- Punk.
- Yo, pick me. Come on.

856
01:14:02,194 --> 01:14:04,526
Get him, get him. Get him. Yeah.

857
01:14:06,932 --> 01:14:09,025
- I just want to kiss your lips.
- No, I can't.

858
01:14:09,201 --> 01:14:10,463
Come here for one second.

859
01:14:10,636 --> 01:14:12,934
- Yeah, yeah.
- All right, all right, all right.

860
01:14:14,573 --> 01:14:16,473
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

861
01:14:17,042 --> 01:14:19,636
Yeah, get him,
get him, get him.

862
01:14:19,812 --> 01:14:21,803
- Please, C.C., don't...
- No.

863
01:14:25,818 --> 01:14:27,149
That's for my 'Vette.

864
01:14:28,053 --> 01:14:29,520
That's for being a punk.

865
01:14:30,456 --> 01:14:32,481
- Stop it.
- That's for wasting my time.

866
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:36,393
Stop!

867
01:14:38,230 --> 01:14:40,289
Cops. Break up, break up.

868
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:49,971
Yeah!

869
01:15:31,783 --> 01:15:33,444
Javi, it's for you.

870
01:15:35,387 --> 01:15:36,376
Hello.

871
01:15:36,555 --> 01:15:38,420
Yo, this is Voltio, what's up?

872
01:15:38,590 --> 01:15:40,251
Hey, what's up?

873
01:15:40,425 --> 01:15:43,189
You know, your father
gave me your demo.

874
01:15:43,362 --> 01:15:44,954
It's amazing, we all love it!

875
01:15:45,130 --> 01:15:46,961
Our producer
wants to work with that.

876
01:15:47,132 --> 01:15:49,896
It's hot. Listen.

877
01:15:50,068 --> 01:15:52,332
I'm about to board a plane
to come to New York...

878
01:15:52,504 --> 01:15:54,165
...for the Puerto Rican Day Parade.

879
01:15:54,339 --> 01:15:55,863
I wanna see you and your crew
on stage. Meet me there. Bye.

880
01:15:56,041 --> 01:15:57,406
That's great, thanks.

881
01:15:57,576 --> 01:15:59,305
Okay.

882
01:16:01,747 --> 01:16:04,045
- Yo. Yo, what you doing?
- Wake up.

883
01:16:04,216 --> 01:16:06,480
You're not gonna believe
what just happened.

884
01:16:06,652 --> 01:16:09,212
Voltio wants us to join him
at the parade.

885
01:16:09,388 --> 01:16:12,585
- He just called me right now.
- What parade?

886
01:16:12,758 --> 01:16:15,727
We're here at the 49th annual
Puerto Rican Day Parade...

887
01:16:15,894 --> 01:16:18,556
...being led by Grand Marshal
Marc Anthony and his wife...

888
01:16:18,730 --> 01:16:21,062
...movie star and recording artist,
Jennifer Lopez.

889
01:16:21,233 --> 01:16:23,098
We're having great weather
in New York...

890
01:16:23,268 --> 01:16:25,293
...and the spirits are running high.

891
01:16:25,470 --> 01:16:28,337
Puerto Rico's greatest musicians
have joined the parade...

892
01:16:28,507 --> 01:16:30,270
...including artists such as Voltio.

893
01:16:30,442 --> 01:16:33,240
According to police estimates,
the crowds are now building...

894
01:16:33,412 --> 01:16:35,903
...to over three million people.

895
01:16:57,502 --> 01:16:59,527
Dear C. C...

896
01:16:59,705 --> 01:17:02,970
...I wanted to apologize
for what I said to you.

897
01:17:03,141 --> 01:17:05,974
I wish I understood myself
a little better.

898
01:17:06,778 --> 01:17:09,611
And in case I don't see you
or go back...

899
01:17:09,781 --> 01:17:12,909
...I wish that you become
an amazing dancer.

900
01:17:13,085 --> 01:17:14,882
You deserve it.

901
01:17:15,053 --> 01:17:16,281
Peace, Rob.

902
01:17:30,702 --> 01:17:32,761
Where are you?

903
01:18:31,630 --> 01:18:33,120
Puerto Rico!

904
01:20:21,706 --> 01:20:24,903
What's up, everybody?

905
01:20:26,178 --> 01:20:30,274
Yeah, you know what's up!

906
01:20:30,482 --> 01:20:33,815
Hey, everybody, we're here
at the Puerto Rican Day Parade.

907
01:20:34,085 --> 01:20:36,781
And we're here chilling hard.

908
01:20:36,955 --> 01:20:39,822
And today,
I have some special guests...

909
01:20:40,058 --> 01:20:42,925
...that came all the way
from San Juan, Puerto Rico...

910
01:20:44,296 --> 01:20:46,389
...the Vega Brothers!

911
01:20:48,033 --> 01:20:49,330
All right, let's go, baby.

912
01:20:53,972 --> 01:20:55,633
What's up?

913
01:20:56,575 --> 01:20:57,599
Javi, what's up, papi?

914
01:20:57,776 --> 01:21:00,472
Hey, yo, what's good,
what's good?

915
01:21:00,712 --> 01:21:03,340
All right, all right, all right.
So check it out.

916
01:21:03,515 --> 01:21:06,575
My name is Rob,
coming straight out of Harlem.

917
01:21:06,751 --> 01:21:09,549
You know, we came to do
a little something for y'all today.

918
01:21:09,721 --> 01:21:12,189
That's my boy Javi
coming straight out of Puerto Rico.

919
01:21:12,357 --> 01:21:14,257
Matter of fact,
I love Puerto Rico.

920
01:21:14,426 --> 01:21:16,860
Yo, yo, do a little something
for them, Javi.

921
01:21:17,996 --> 01:21:19,588
Okay.

922
01:21:23,068 --> 01:21:25,593
Yes, sir. So check it out.

923
01:21:25,770 --> 01:21:28,136
Y'all can put your hands up
just like this.

924
01:21:28,306 --> 01:21:31,901
Put your hands up. Yeah, yeah.
Don't be afraid. It's all good.

925
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:37,840
I have a surprise
for this man right here.

926
01:21:38,016 --> 01:21:40,917
Joining us
is one of the best musicians.

927
01:21:41,086 --> 01:21:43,520
One of the best musicians
from Puerto Rico.

928
01:21:43,688 --> 01:21:47,590
An amazing percussionist.

929
01:21:47,759 --> 01:21:51,388
Here he is, Roberto Vega.

930
01:21:55,634 --> 01:21:56,896
Julio Voltio.

931
01:21:58,403 --> 01:21:59,734
It's good to see you.

932
01:22:01,773 --> 01:22:03,001
How are you?

933
01:22:03,174 --> 01:22:05,056
It's great to be here 
in New York City.

934
01:22:05,057 --> 01:22:06,166
It's good to see you.

935
01:22:06,344 --> 01:22:09,677
- Man, this is crazy.

936
01:22:11,616 --> 01:22:15,143
Yeah, yeah, put your hands up,
Puerto Rico.

937
01:22:19,090 --> 01:22:21,149
I'm so glad you're here.

938
01:22:22,227 --> 01:22:24,627
I am so proud of you, son.

939
01:22:25,130 --> 01:22:26,654
Thanks.

940
01:22:27,265 --> 01:22:28,664
Man...

941
01:22:41,313 --> 01:22:43,247
Did you get my message?

01:22:44,049 --> 01:22:45,292
Yeah, I got it.

943
01:22:45,293 --> 01:22:47,280
So I'll see you after?

All right.
All right, let's do this.

01:22:59,698 --> 01:23:02,929
Yeah. Put your hands up.

947

Put your hands up.
