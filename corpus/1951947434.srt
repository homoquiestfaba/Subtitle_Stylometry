1
00:00:01,808 --> 00:00:04,344
We were supposed to recon the area
two hours ago.

2
00:00:04,417 --> 00:00:06,141
The meet's set
For tonight.

3
00:00:06,176 --> 00:00:08,935
- Couldn't be helped.
- Delay at customs.

4
00:00:11,252 --> 00:00:12,599
That's a lot Of euros.

5
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:14,258
That's what alexander
The great said.

6
00:00:14,287 --> 00:00:16,274
I'm the one who had to
Sign for the 32 million,

7
00:00:16,298 --> 00:00:18,901
So don't let me catch you wearing prada
On the way home.

8
00:00:19,292 --> 00:00:21,065
Middle man takes two
For his cut.

9
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,886
Petrov doesn't show
His face

10
00:00:22,968 --> 00:00:24,694
Until the local guy
Checks you out.

11
00:00:24,729 --> 00:00:26,767
let's make up
For lost time.

12
00:00:26,837 --> 00:00:30,042
I think i got your sizes right.
It will help you Fit in better.

13
00:00:30,054 --> 00:00:31,181
Fit in where?

14
00:00:31,216 --> 00:00:33,028
The middle man, dragan,
The operates a club.

15
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,412
- We'll take it From here.
- It's not a gay club.

16
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:38,606
To hop the rope, you'll need arm candy.
That would be me.

17
00:01:19,203 --> 00:01:23,253
Corner of the bar, maroon shirt,
gold chain.

18
00:01:46,868 --> 00:01:49,486
- Dragan?
- Yes. Is right.

19
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,400
It's pleasure
To meet you.

20
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,868
You, too.
Let's do some business.

21
00:02:03,639 --> 00:02:05,774
How long are you
Staying in kosovo?

22
00:02:05,798 --> 00:02:08,745
Just long enough for us to conduct
Our business.

23
00:02:13,443 --> 00:02:14,629
You know the price.

24
00:02:14,672 --> 00:02:16,400
I am prepared
To pay.

25
00:02:16,472 --> 00:02:18,726
It's a lot of cash
For a little african country.

26
00:02:18,891 --> 00:02:21,553
It's not a lot Of cash to me.
Do you want to Count my money

27
00:02:21,576 --> 00:02:23,338
Or do business?

28
00:02:26,444 --> 00:02:29,837
I can have Petrov tomorrow
Here with your package.

29
00:02:30,354 --> 00:02:31,740
So where is the money?

30
00:02:32,057 --> 00:02:34,839
When i get The plutonium,
and i need To test it.

31
00:02:34,871 --> 00:02:38,429
It has already Been tested.
It's pu-239.

32
00:02:38,488 --> 00:02:40,120
Yes. Very
Reassuring.

33
00:02:40,167 --> 00:02:41,434
Nonetheless.

34
00:02:41,506 --> 00:02:42,909
You worry too much.

35
00:02:42,967 --> 00:02:44,905
No. You see
The money

36
00:02:44,928 --> 00:02:46,290
When i see petrov.

37
00:02:46,337 --> 00:02:48,421
He doesn't like
To be fooled with.

38
00:02:48,474 --> 00:02:51,550
Neither do i.
Tomorrow?

39
00:02:52,967 --> 00:02:54,282
Tomorrow.

40
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:58,734
But tonight, you will stay
as my guest.

41
00:02:59,061 --> 00:03:00,916
Are you hungry
Or thirsty?

42
00:03:00,951 --> 00:03:02,501
No. I'm fine,
Thank you.

43
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,000
i would like to show you some
hospitality.

44
00:03:06,047 --> 00:03:08,313
You're my new friend,
Right?

45
00:03:08,383 --> 00:03:09,804
Follow me.

46
00:03:17,361 --> 00:03:18,576
And this is?

47
00:03:18,888 --> 00:03:21,788
A gesture
Of good faith.

48
00:03:23,115 --> 00:03:24,488
Just like that?

49
00:03:24,535 --> 00:03:27,085
Anything you want.
She does it all.

50
00:03:27,464 --> 00:03:31,434
Backwards, forwards,
Upside down.

51
00:03:34,704 --> 00:03:36,899
Whatever he likes.

52
00:03:46,855 --> 00:03:48,467
More than ok.

53
00:03:54,453 --> 00:03:56,406
First, tell me
Your name.

54
00:03:59,193 --> 00:04:00,994
How long have you
Worked here, Dava?

55
00:04:01,393 --> 00:04:02,869
Two months.

56
00:04:04,196 --> 00:04:05,501
Wait.

57
00:04:05,908 --> 00:04:07,096
But dragan said--

58
00:04:07,143 --> 00:04:08,701
I know what dragan said,

59
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:10,879
But my religion
Prevents me,

60
00:04:11,141 --> 00:04:15,508
As it also prevents me from refusing
a gift from my host,

61
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:17,648
So please

62
00:04:17,671 --> 00:04:18,646
just

63
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:21,275
Just sit down.

64
00:04:30,191 --> 00:04:32,534
you seem like
Nice man.

65
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:39,948
But others are not so.

66
00:04:41,903 --> 00:04:44,145
I would never hurt you.

67
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:50,803
But will you
Help me?

68
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,560
If i were able to.

69
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,257
My friend
Nadia and i,

70
00:04:56,704 --> 00:04:58,676
We come to kosovo
To be models,

71
00:04:59,264 --> 00:05:01,002
But when we
Get here,

72
00:05:01,025 --> 00:05:03,431
He take our passport,
He beat us.

73
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,770
He keep us hid.

74
00:05:07,845 --> 00:05:09,426
There are others?

75
00:05:09,532 --> 00:05:13,676
Some he sell, some he make
work here.

76
00:05:14,018 --> 00:05:17,427
My friend nadia,
She's very sick.

77
00:05:17,873 --> 00:05:19,693
If we don't get
Out of here soon,

78
00:05:19,728 --> 00:05:21,824
She will die
In this hell.

79
00:05:22,347 --> 00:05:24,202
Will you help us?

80
00:05:42,701 --> 00:05:44,033
Trouble.

81
00:05:50,226 --> 00:05:51,975
Who are they?

82
00:05:52,046 --> 00:05:54,934
They're here
For the plutonium, too.

83
00:05:55,451 --> 00:05:57,367
Terrorist arms brokers.

84
00:05:57,391 --> 00:05:59,278
Looks like our sale
Just turned into an auction.

85
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:06,869
* The Unit Team  *

86
00:06:07,113 --> 00:06:12,184
* www.seriessub.com *

87
00:06:12,267 --> 00:06:14,181
* Presents*

88
00:06:14,225 --> 00:06:17,338
* Season 4 Episode 3 *

89
00:06:30,334 --> 00:06:33,834
Doctor, you feeling
Anbetter?

90
00:06:33,973 --> 00:06:36,367
When do i move
To a real hospital?

91
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:37,568
About that.

92
00:06:37,638 --> 00:06:40,319
- You've got my results.
- It's as you thought.

93
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,549
Radiation specialist
Is on his way now.

94
00:06:42,596 --> 00:06:44,275
I can save him
The trip.

95
00:06:44,299 --> 00:06:47,034
Filgrastim for
The white blood cell count,

96
00:06:47,153 --> 00:06:49,201
Potassium iodide
For the thyroid,

97
00:06:49,265 --> 00:06:52,468
And promethazine hydrochloride
For the nausea

98
00:06:52,489 --> 00:06:56,044
Unless you can find me
Something herbal.

99
00:06:56,204 --> 00:06:58,633
They don't dispense that medication
On base.

100
00:06:58,748 --> 00:07:01,548
My question is this?
Were you poisoned by the plutonium,

101
00:07:01,584 --> 00:07:03,544
Or did you just get
Sloppy in the lab?

102
00:07:03,586 --> 00:07:05,508
It's an occupational
Hazard.

103
00:07:05,526 --> 00:07:08,101
If your occupation
Is terrorism.

104
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:10,767
I was paid to test
Their isotopes.

105
00:07:11,177 --> 00:07:12,595
I'd like to
Believe you,

106
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:14,885
And we still think
That you're
A valuable asset.

107
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,928
sure you do,
But i don't wish

108
00:07:16,963 --> 00:07:19,325
To spend my last weeks

109
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,946
or days

110
00:07:21,239 --> 00:07:22,583
locked up In here.

111
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:25,589
Client didn't tell you how he planned
To use the plutonium?

112
00:07:26,165 --> 00:07:27,914
but i gather
From what you've told me

113
00:07:27,944 --> 00:07:30,867
He'll sell it to someone who plans
to make quite a large bomb.

114
00:07:30,905 --> 00:07:32,909
You gather that,
Do you?

115
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:37,565
When will i be moved
To a regular hospital?

116
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,546
You'll have your chance to see
your mr. Petrov again.

117
00:07:41,397 --> 00:07:44,720
you have broken our agreement.
You are insulting Our country.

118
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:47,000
What can i tell you,
My friend?

119
00:07:47,068 --> 00:07:48,234
It happens.

120
00:07:48,254 --> 00:07:49,797
When did this
Other buyer appear?

121
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,089
There are always
Buyers

122
00:07:51,124 --> 00:07:52,968
For a product
Like this.

123
00:07:53,085 --> 00:07:54,400
He is willing
To pay more.

124
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:55,767
How much more?

125
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,367
5 million more.

126
00:07:57,547 --> 00:08:01,202
No, no. I will not
Be your stalking horse.

127
00:08:02,142 --> 00:08:04,337
The free market,
My friend.

128
00:08:07,766 --> 00:08:09,406
I need more time.

129
00:08:11,161 --> 00:08:12,453
I'm on your side,

130
00:08:12,501 --> 00:08:14,954
But petrov, he doesn't
Like to wait.

131
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,633
I can beat
Their offer.

132
00:08:17,678 --> 00:08:19,367
I need time.

133
00:08:24,234 --> 00:08:26,734
How did you like
The girl?

134
00:08:27,897 --> 00:08:29,764
She served
Her purpose.

135
00:08:29,834 --> 00:08:30,985
Too old?

136
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,123
I have a 14-year-old
If you want.

137
00:08:34,851 --> 00:08:36,671
That is very
Thoughtful of you,

138
00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:38,767
But i must decline.

139
00:08:42,716 --> 00:08:45,417
We got no time to dummy up
A wire transfer.

140
00:08:45,464 --> 00:08:47,377
What about
The agency?

141
00:08:47,424 --> 00:08:49,900
We're barred from contact
With the station.

142
00:08:49,961 --> 00:08:52,201
We'd do better going
from my cut-out account.

143
00:08:52,262 --> 00:08:53,953
for 5 million euros?

144
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:56,706
What do we use for collateral,
my old desoto?

145
00:08:56,866 --> 00:08:58,947
If the black market's
Laying out 38 mill for nukes

146
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,474
They already got
Their buyers standing by,

147
00:09:00,524 --> 00:09:02,141
Either narco-terrorists
Or al-qaeda.

148
00:09:02,168 --> 00:09:04,869
- So where do we find these new players?
- We know they're In town.

149
00:09:04,927 --> 00:09:07,722
and that they're well-guarded,
sitting on all That cash?

150
00:09:07,757 --> 00:09:11,095
So how did our winning ways
compete with all that cash?

151
00:09:11,255 --> 00:09:14,711
Can't outspend them,
Must outthink them.

152
00:09:14,836 --> 00:09:16,492
Outspend them
Or outshoot them.

153
00:09:16,531 --> 00:09:18,767
Does that
Include Dragan?

154
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,341
Starting with dragan.
The man's scum.

155
00:09:21,376 --> 00:09:22,744
Yeah, but he's
Our scum.

156
00:09:22,809 --> 00:09:24,870
Besides plutonium,
He traffics in girls,

157
00:09:24,905 --> 00:09:26,596
Most of them younger
Than my daughter.

158
00:09:26,631 --> 00:09:28,369
If we stay with dragan,
He may lead us

159
00:09:28,392 --> 00:09:29,566
To the other buyers.

160
00:09:29,601 --> 00:09:31,104
Eventually perhaps.

161
00:09:31,151 --> 00:09:33,767
Hold on. We don't have
To do the recon ourselves.

162
00:09:33,835 --> 00:09:36,266
There are others who might want
To help us.

163
00:09:36,336 --> 00:09:37,557
Others?

164
00:09:37,874 --> 00:09:40,167
Those who might
Want a favor in return.

165
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:06,564
I came back for you.

166
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:16,167
I need your help.

167
00:10:16,434 --> 00:10:18,759
How can i help you?

168
00:10:19,569 --> 00:10:22,869
There's a man
At the bar with dragan.

169
00:10:23,646 --> 00:10:26,201
I need to know something
About him and his friends,

170
00:10:26,305 --> 00:10:27,885
An address.

171
00:10:29,501 --> 00:10:31,082
you want me to...

172
00:10:31,106 --> 00:10:33,207
I don't care how.

173
00:10:36,248 --> 00:10:39,149
- But if i do this...
- Then i will Help you.

174
00:10:41,822 --> 00:10:44,030
Your friend nadia,
Is she the one

175
00:10:44,065 --> 00:10:46,284
Stuck to dragan's side?

176
00:10:47,001 --> 00:10:49,666
Then i will get you
Both out.

177
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:09,315
One for you,
Mrs. Bechet.

178
00:11:10,883 --> 00:11:12,733
Another for you,
Mrs. Dahl.

179
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:14,401
it's like
Christmas come early.

180
00:11:14,441 --> 00:11:15,948
is there any
Cash in here?

181
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,764
asking the wrong guy.
I'm just the pony express.

182
00:11:20,692 --> 00:11:22,101
Looking.

183
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:30,818
My own california
Teaching certificate.

184
00:11:31,106 --> 00:11:33,301
I'm back
In the classroom.

185
00:11:33,372 --> 00:11:35,767
Oh, my god.
I start this morning.

186
00:11:35,806 --> 00:11:37,450
At least you won't
Have to fake it.

187
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:39,798
Vice president of marketing,
Aerodyne alliance.

188
00:11:39,822 --> 00:11:41,184
I'm still waiting
To find out

189
00:11:41,219 --> 00:11:42,857
What this alliance
Actually makes.

190
00:11:42,892 --> 00:11:46,168
maker
what we say we make?

191
00:11:47,354 --> 00:11:52,214
Aircraft engines,
Custom appliances.

192
00:11:52,821 --> 00:11:55,216
our new base of operations.

193
00:11:55,275 --> 00:11:57,475
Your new clubhouse.

194
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,267
Don't expect me
To sweep up.

195
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:01,127
Why do i feel like the girl
with the glasses

196
00:12:01,162 --> 00:12:03,170
At the homecoming dance?

197
00:12:03,229 --> 00:12:06,270
- i'm sure it's not deliberate.
- Everything here Is deliberate.

198
00:12:06,698 --> 00:12:08,967
Taking my kids away
From me was deliberate.

199
00:12:09,099 --> 00:12:11,735
there's no good
In complaining.

200
00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:13,411
It's unfair.

201
00:12:13,493 --> 00:12:14,633
It's unfortunate,

202
00:12:14,772 --> 00:12:17,573
It's regrettable,
It's tragic,

203
00:12:17,872 --> 00:12:19,141
But it's not unfair.

204
00:12:19,176 --> 00:12:21,606
The army's trying
To keep us safe.

205
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:24,537
Maybe they're still
Working out your cover.

206
00:12:26,228 --> 00:12:28,301
And maybe i'm better off
without one.

207
00:12:28,365 --> 00:12:30,628
We're all going to
Make it through this.

208
00:12:36,852 --> 00:12:38,801
- Wait up.
- I heard you, mom.

209
00:12:38,836 --> 00:12:40,691
you didn't
Let me finish.

210
00:12:40,738 --> 00:12:44,475
I get it.
You didn't ask for this job.

211
00:12:45,243 --> 00:12:46,734
Can we talk
About this later?

212
00:12:46,781 --> 00:12:47,990
look At it this way.

213
00:12:48,026 --> 00:12:49,267
We're both new here.

214
00:12:49,329 --> 00:12:52,167
At least now we can
Look out for each other.

215
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:53,734
I don't need
Looking after.

216
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,334
Just to keep our
Stories straight.

217
00:12:56,497 --> 00:12:59,134
I'm not gonna blow
our cover like you almost did.

218
00:12:59,374 --> 00:13:02,533
come on. Let's try and
be Nice to each other?

219
00:13:02,568 --> 00:13:04,428
Look. I'll see you
After school.

220
00:13:06,683 --> 00:13:08,972
Man, i am so sorry.

221
00:13:09,008 --> 00:13:10,568
Really. Are you ok?

222
00:13:10,599 --> 00:13:13,267
Yeah. I'm all right.
Just get to class!

223
00:13:20,164 --> 00:13:21,902
This is jessica
At the agency

224
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,468
Confirming your
Interview this afternoon.

225
00:13:23,487 --> 00:13:25,166
I'm sorry. You have
The wrong number.

226
00:13:25,213 --> 00:13:26,493
Kim cahill?

227
00:13:28,426 --> 00:13:30,301
It is. Yes, but--

228
00:13:30,328 --> 00:13:32,124
I have your employment card
right here.

229
00:13:32,148 --> 00:13:33,967
Your interview's
At 1:00.

230
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,435
The interview.

231
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:38,694
A wonderful couple with a teenage son
and an infant daughter.

232
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:40,800
And what exactly are
They looking for?

233
00:13:40,866 --> 00:13:43,661
They need someone who can start
right away full-time.

234
00:13:44,436 --> 00:13:45,367
I see, but...

235
00:13:45,454 --> 00:13:48,894
They just lost their nanny,
And they're really in a bind.

236
00:13:49,305 --> 00:13:50,608
A nanny.

237
00:13:51,827 --> 00:13:53,867
Our old nanny quit
Out of nowhere,

238
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:56,301
Just disappeared
Without an explanation.

239
00:13:56,367 --> 00:13:59,011
So above all, we really need
someone we feel we can trust.

240
00:13:59,058 --> 00:14:00,901
Of course. Some people just
aren't cut out

241
00:14:00,948 --> 00:14:02,991
For children.

242
00:14:03,026 --> 00:14:05,187
Well, your references
Are excellent.

243
00:14:05,234 --> 00:14:07,134
Looks like most of them
Are from kansas

244
00:14:07,176 --> 00:14:08,434
That's right.

245
00:14:08,636 --> 00:14:10,301
What brings you
To california?

246
00:14:10,574 --> 00:14:13,063
My husband's company transferred
him out here.

247
00:14:13,475 --> 00:14:15,034
What does he do
For work?

248
00:14:15,142 --> 00:14:19,234
He's in the private aircraft business,
sales.

249
00:14:19,306 --> 00:14:22,700
Unfortunately,
He travels a lot,

250
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,834
So that leaves me with plenty
of free time.

251
00:14:24,895 --> 00:14:27,282
My wife's always
On the road for work, too.

252
00:14:27,329 --> 00:14:30,605
- It's not easy with a newborn.
- No. Not easy for you.

253
00:14:33,171 --> 00:14:35,448
Looks like you've had some experience
with infants.

254
00:14:35,472 --> 00:14:37,067
i come from a big family

255
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:38,372
Nieces, nephews,

256
00:14:38,407 --> 00:14:40,251
And a lot
Fo dirty diapers.

257
00:14:40,556 --> 00:14:42,760
We also have
A 15-year-old, lucas.

258
00:14:42,807 --> 00:14:45,062
- He's a real jock.
- Can't wait To meet him.

259
00:14:45,101 --> 00:14:46,612
How about
This afternoon?

260
00:14:46,647 --> 00:14:47,868
Excuse me?

261
00:14:47,915 --> 00:14:49,805
Can you start today?

262
00:15:09,415 --> 00:15:11,094
Did you get it?

263
00:15:11,629 --> 00:15:13,003
Told him he was
So good

264
00:15:13,027 --> 00:15:14,776
I wanted
To see him for free.

265
00:15:14,827 --> 00:15:16,666
Where is he staying?

266
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,676
First, you help.
I need doctor.

267
00:15:23,968 --> 00:15:26,199
After the doctor,
If you should run--

268
00:15:26,234 --> 00:15:27,700
I cannot run.

269
00:15:27,772 --> 00:15:30,805
As long as dragan
has nadia, i cannot run.

270
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:32,568
Let's go.

271
00:15:44,733 --> 00:15:48,571
It works for my little
Emily, too.

272
00:15:48,934 --> 00:15:50,501
Are you all right?

273
00:15:56,153 --> 00:15:57,949
I'm sorry.

274
00:15:58,219 --> 00:16:00,051
It's just that
My husband and i

275
00:16:00,086 --> 00:16:02,108
Have been trying so hard
To have one of our own,

276
00:16:02,155 --> 00:16:04,883
And she's beautiful.

277
00:16:05,425 --> 00:16:07,201
I understand.

278
00:16:07,327 --> 00:16:08,434
You do?

279
00:16:08,454 --> 00:16:09,957
Marion and i did
Fertility treatments

280
00:16:10,004 --> 00:16:11,437
For 6 years.

281
00:16:11,531 --> 00:16:12,633
It's rough.

282
00:16:12,634 --> 00:16:13,967
Harder than i thought.

283
00:16:13,996 --> 00:16:15,561
Are you
On a protocol?

284
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:17,794
Fertility
Treatments.

285
00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:20,053
I had to give marion
Shots twice a day.

286
00:16:20,968 --> 00:16:23,167
We're trying everything.

287
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,387
- How many ccs Are you on?
- Gosh

288
00:16:25,904 --> 00:16:28,628
There's so many,
I get them all confused.

289
00:16:28,675 --> 00:16:31,000
It's the one
In the oil solution.

290
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:32,615
I became
A real expert.

291
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,668
To tell you the truth, i let
my husband be the expert.

292
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:40,012
He says, "bottoms up,"
And i don't even look.

293
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,600
It will work out.

294
00:16:42,659 --> 00:16:44,381
You're very kind.

295
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,367
You know what they say.

296
00:16:46,487 --> 00:16:48,093
Your children
Will find you.

297
00:16:48,418 --> 00:16:49,780
I hope so.

298
00:17:05,642 --> 00:17:06,962
Need any help?

299
00:17:06,997 --> 00:17:09,216
No, thanks.
I'm just waiting
For my daughter.

300
00:17:09,615 --> 00:17:11,134
Almost everyone's
gone home already.

301
00:17:11,201 --> 00:17:13,789
- Yeah. Looks That way.
- Want me to go look for her?

302
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,104
No. It's ok.

303
00:17:15,127 --> 00:17:16,830
No. I'd be glad to.

304
00:17:17,017 --> 00:17:18,567
It's not necessary,

305
00:17:18,744 --> 00:17:21,291
Josh. I didn't
Hurt you, i hope.

306
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,360
A little whiplash
Is all.

307
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:24,698
Oh, my god.
I'm sorry.

308
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,142
I'm kidding.

309
00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:28,749
I had that kind of injury
last season right here.

310
00:17:28,773 --> 00:17:31,234
I said it's not
Necessary.

311
00:17:31,344 --> 00:17:33,585
Make you feel better.

312
00:17:33,902 --> 00:17:35,875
I beg your pardon?

313
00:17:35,957 --> 00:17:38,118
You never know.

314
00:17:39,034 --> 00:17:41,805
I think you'll be better off
focusing Your attention

315
00:17:41,834 --> 00:17:43,636
On girls
Your own age.

316
00:17:43,941 --> 00:17:46,568
the girls here
are immature.

317
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,468
I prefer women.

318
00:17:48,532 --> 00:17:50,367
Nothing like
Ambition.

319
00:17:50,434 --> 00:17:53,430
For example, you.

320
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:56,267
I'm a teacher,
And you're a minor.

321
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:57,551
I'm 18.

322
00:17:57,644 --> 00:18:00,051
You're not hearing Me, josh.
It's against school policy,

323
00:18:00,062 --> 00:18:02,293
And it's against the law,
and it's against my wishes,

324
00:18:02,328 --> 00:18:04,545
Which i have made plain,
So move on.

325
00:18:06,334 --> 00:18:08,308
You don't have to be
A bitch about it.

326
00:18:08,334 --> 00:18:09,835
Good-bye, josh.

327
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,629
you know, 10 years from now
when that face is all cracked,

328
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,989
You're gonna be thinking about what you
could have had.

329
00:18:15,036 --> 00:18:16,774
Get out of my sight.

330
00:18:38,286 --> 00:18:40,517
Someone was very rough
On that girl.

331
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:42,534
She says you're
Her boyfriend.

332
00:18:42,595 --> 00:18:44,267
Just tell me
You can help her.

333
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:47,034
I can,
But it's involved.

334
00:18:47,164 --> 00:18:51,000
I see. So let us
Make it simple.

335
00:18:53,128 --> 00:18:55,030
I'll do what's possible.

336
00:18:55,064 --> 00:18:56,732
I'm sure you will.

337
00:19:04,973 --> 00:19:07,851
- Let go of her.
- She's a thief! Look!

338
00:19:07,898 --> 00:19:09,522
Show him!

339
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:12,440
I will pay. I will.

340
00:19:14,477 --> 00:19:15,863
- Morphine.
- Drug addict.

341
00:19:15,933 --> 00:19:18,352
It's not for me,
I swear.

342
00:19:18,904 --> 00:19:20,555
It's for nadia.

343
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,739
She has aids.

344
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:24,993
She always has pain.

345
00:19:38,134 --> 00:19:39,566
Let us go.

346
00:20:01,874 --> 00:20:04,623
- Who's there?
- Dragan sent me.

347
00:20:08,109 --> 00:20:10,000
For his
Best clients.

348
00:20:25,903 --> 00:20:28,462
Dragan saved
The best for last.

349
00:20:28,603 --> 00:20:31,401
Maybe you had to
Prove yourselves.

350
00:20:31,468 --> 00:20:33,434
How do you prove
Yourself?

351
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,698
Me?

352
00:20:37,598 --> 00:20:39,242
I'm a specialist.

353
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:42,427
Good. Because i got something special
For you.

354
00:20:42,462 --> 00:20:45,434
First, get me
A drink, will you?

355
00:20:53,629 --> 00:20:55,867
You have
A lovely view.

356
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,800
We're out of ice.

357
00:20:57,985 --> 00:21:00,726
Good.
I like it warm.

358
00:21:02,252 --> 00:21:05,000
Where's your
Accent from?

359
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:08,000
You want small talk,
Get a girlfriend.

360
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:10,498
I don't have time
For it.

361
00:21:12,905 --> 00:21:14,568
Feel good?

362
00:21:16,426 --> 00:21:18,070
it's my turn.

363
00:21:18,134 --> 00:21:19,502
Sure is.

364
00:21:34,967 --> 00:21:36,000
Clear.

365
00:21:37,295 --> 00:21:38,222
Clear.

366
00:21:38,246 --> 00:21:39,373
By the couch.

367
00:21:39,455 --> 00:21:40,510
I got it.

368
00:21:48,237 --> 00:21:49,267
Here.

369
00:22:04,667 --> 00:22:06,699
They make money
The old-fashioned way.

370
00:22:06,746 --> 00:22:08,695
They steal it.

371
00:22:09,634 --> 00:22:11,500
I guess the bidding's
Closed.

372
00:22:13,636 --> 00:22:15,608
Lucky for you

373
00:22:15,655 --> 00:22:17,820
Maybe they found
Another deal elsewhere.

374
00:22:17,843 --> 00:22:19,851
They didn't drop out
From the bidding.

375
00:22:19,886 --> 00:22:21,718
They dropped dead.

376
00:22:21,741 --> 00:22:23,720
these things
Happen, my friend,

377
00:22:23,766 --> 00:22:26,983
- In a free market economy.
- But i don't think That petrov

378
00:22:27,007 --> 00:22:28,938
Is gon sell you this plutonium
On the cheap.

379
00:22:28,985 --> 00:22:32,813
But where i come from,
32 million is not cheap.

380
00:22:32,848 --> 00:22:36,224
37 million.
That was the price.

381
00:22:36,283 --> 00:22:38,208
37 million.

382
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:40,792
When you had two bidders.
Now you have only the one.

383
00:22:40,827 --> 00:22:43,833
One who will pay
37 million,

384
00:22:43,868 --> 00:22:45,858
And they want
Your assurance

385
00:22:45,893 --> 00:22:49,968
That no one else in this transaction
Drops out.

386
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:58,200
I believe
We have a deal.

387
00:22:59,356 --> 00:23:01,001
I'm still not Getting the uplink.

388
00:23:01,035 --> 00:23:02,756
Will you check
Your lnb connection?

389
00:23:02,803 --> 00:23:06,243
Try doubling back the wire
before you hit The solder.

390
00:23:10,325 --> 00:23:11,793
I got it.

391
00:23:12,498 --> 00:23:15,147
Up and ready
For business here.

392
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:18,994
Great. And while you're at it,

393
00:23:19,018 --> 00:23:20,984
Then we'll really get noticed.
you can put the chrome rims on.

394
00:23:21,014 --> 00:23:24,542
Redcap, don't teach your grandmother
how to suck eggs.

395
00:23:26,033 --> 00:23:30,073
Now we're just another
Wandering band of gypsies.

396
00:23:30,894 --> 00:23:32,959
Smile, bridge,
For your home page.

397
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:37,001
Slavic lethargy.
What do you think?

398
00:23:37,362 --> 00:23:39,441
How about something
A little more viral?

399
00:23:39,464 --> 00:23:41,989
What do you want
Me to do, blow them a kiss.

400
00:23:42,042 --> 00:23:43,668
They'll love that
In the toc.

401
00:23:43,704 --> 00:23:46,392
Colonel ryan's not much
of a romantic

402
00:23:53,226 --> 00:23:54,729
What?

403
00:23:58,087 --> 00:23:59,684
Let's throw
This thing together.

404
00:23:59,707 --> 00:24:02,001
We got half an hour
To get in place.

405
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,108
I just got a call
From the office.

406
00:24:08,131 --> 00:24:10,480
- I have to go in today.
- You want me to stay with ella?

407
00:24:10,526 --> 00:24:12,476
If you don't mind.
I'm sorry.

408
00:24:12,523 --> 00:24:14,345
I thought i was gonna be able to work
From home today.

409
00:24:14,392 --> 00:24:16,857
I can stay
As long as you want.

410
00:24:17,409 --> 00:24:19,711
I'll watch her as if
She were my own.

411
00:24:20,016 --> 00:24:22,756
Let me give you
My cell number

412
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:25,504
Just in case
You need anything.

413
00:24:29,449 --> 00:24:31,821
I can't tell you
How grateful i am.

414
00:24:33,478 --> 00:24:34,801
Don't worry.

415
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:55,867
Need to get used to the developmental
approach out here.

416
00:24:55,902 --> 00:24:57,921
You know, if you
Ever have a problem
With the curriculum,

417
00:24:57,945 --> 00:24:59,603
Feel free to stop
By my office.

418
00:24:59,626 --> 00:25:01,352
would you Excuse me?
I see a student of mine

419
00:25:01,371 --> 00:25:03,208
I need to speak with him.

420
00:25:05,284 --> 00:25:07,421
- What are you doing?
- Going to class.

421
00:25:07,468 --> 00:25:09,980
I thought you said the girls out here
Were too immature for you,

422
00:25:10,908 --> 00:25:14,349
She's 16, and she is
not for you.

423
00:25:14,373 --> 00:25:16,792
She's too young
For me, you're too old for me.

424
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:18,377
Let's try this.
You date who you want,

425
00:25:18,412 --> 00:25:20,226
Lissy dates
Who she wants.

426
00:25:21,471 --> 00:25:24,371
You're a predator,
and you're looking for a victim.

427
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:26,619
I understand.
I am not a victim.

428
00:25:26,643 --> 00:25:28,932
You think i'm an easy mark,
I will correct you.

429
00:25:28,979 --> 00:25:31,797
Stay away
From my daughter and me.

430
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:35,109
if you weren't making it so hard,
I wouldn't have to go that way.

431
00:25:35,127 --> 00:25:37,769
Let's get this Straight.
If i find you anywhere near Lissy again,

432
00:25:37,804 --> 00:25:39,777
I will make you
Regret it.

433
00:25:39,812 --> 00:25:41,832
I could report you
To the principal

434
00:25:41,879 --> 00:25:43,433
For using
Threatening language.

435
00:25:43,469 --> 00:25:45,817
I mean, it is against school policy
and against the law.

436
00:25:45,864 --> 00:25:47,453
Do you want me to take this
To the office?

437
00:25:47,496 --> 00:25:49,284
What are you gonna say,
that i hit on you yesterday

438
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:51,574
And you didn't Report it immediately
As required?

439
00:25:51,629 --> 00:25:53,042
And then i'd tell
The principal

440
00:25:53,077 --> 00:25:55,267
That the reason you kept your
mouth shut

441
00:25:55,291 --> 00:25:56,642
Was because you

442
00:25:56,689 --> 00:25:58,826
Hit on me,
Threatened me

443
00:25:58,845 --> 00:26:00,563
If i told anyone.

444
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:07,836
And now i have
An eyewitness.

445
00:26:08,094 --> 00:26:10,654
maybe i should
Just go tell her myself,

446
00:26:10,677 --> 00:26:11,552
Or

447
00:26:12,116 --> 00:26:13,689
we could

448
00:26:13,713 --> 00:26:15,897
work something out.

449
00:26:37,701 --> 00:26:39,471
Dirt diver,
We're in place.

450
00:26:39,506 --> 00:26:40,610
<i>we're in position.</i>

451
00:26:40,633 --> 00:26:43,867
<i>No one moves on petrov until we've got
A positive i.d.</i>

452
00:26:49,419 --> 00:26:51,133
<i>Snake doc's
Got company.</i>

453
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,400
Please.

454
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:57,661
I hope you don't mind
That i took the liberty

455
00:26:57,709 --> 00:26:59,729
Of ordering
Some espresso.

456
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:01,549
Thank you.

457
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:07,003
I have 37 million
Reasons

458
00:27:07,038 --> 00:27:09,304
Why we should conclude
Our business today.

459
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:12,233
I will have to see those 37 million
Reasons.

460
00:27:12,257 --> 00:27:14,734
Cool breeze,
This is dog patch 0-6.

461
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:16,413
We got
A clear transmission,

462
00:27:16,449 --> 00:27:18,533
But we can't get
A positive i.d.

463
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:21,738
Coming your way
Most rikki-tik.

464
00:27:30,534 --> 00:27:31,934
Red cap, we're rolling.

465
00:27:32,001 --> 00:27:36,300
I need
A look my way, please.

466
00:27:36,367 --> 00:27:37,934
There is a location,

467
00:27:38,001 --> 00:27:39,734
And we need
A little bit
Of time.

468
00:27:39,801 --> 00:27:41,034
How much time?

469
00:27:45,393 --> 00:27:46,520
Nyet, nyet.

470
00:27:46,602 --> 00:27:49,174
Got it. Great!
Run it, print it!

471
00:27:49,573 --> 00:27:51,017
Dirt diver, stand by.

472
00:27:51,041 --> 00:27:53,721
We're gonna get
Your confirmation.

473
00:27:53,745 --> 00:27:55,034
That him?

474
00:27:58,344 --> 00:28:00,234
No. I don't
Recognize him.

475
00:28:00,269 --> 00:28:02,001
That's not petrov?

476
00:28:04,701 --> 00:28:07,467
I've never seen
This man before.

477
00:28:12,437 --> 00:28:14,714
Dirt diver, we got
A situation.

478
00:28:14,749 --> 00:28:17,673
That man with snake doctor
Is not petrov.

479
00:28:17,708 --> 00:28:20,734
I repeat.
That is not our target.

480
00:28:25,889 --> 00:28:27,934
We have deal?

481
00:28:34,271 --> 00:28:35,734
You want, you want.

482
00:28:56,659 --> 00:28:58,634
We have come
To the terms.

483
00:28:58,667 --> 00:29:00,088
Let's get the package.

484
00:29:00,135 --> 00:29:01,520
Hold.

485
00:29:02,178 --> 00:29:04,096
How do i know that he
Is who he says?

486
00:29:04,167 --> 00:29:05,705
Who do you think
I am?

487
00:29:05,755 --> 00:29:07,934
I was told to deal
Only with petrov.

488
00:29:07,998 --> 00:29:09,724
He's got
What you need.

489
00:29:09,747 --> 00:29:11,215
That's who he is.

490
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,634
You lied to me!
Who is this man?

491
00:29:13,665 --> 00:29:15,531
How do you know that
This is not petrov?

492
00:29:15,567 --> 00:29:17,821
Because you have asked
The question.

493
00:29:20,322 --> 00:29:22,130
He is not
Actually petrov.

494
00:29:22,166 --> 00:29:24,225
I work for petrov.

495
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,393
You said petrov himself.
Where's petrov?

496
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:28,267
he is...it's just better.

497
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:30,688
He doesn't like
you know, to expose himself.

498
00:29:30,848 --> 00:29:34,233
For 37 million, he can dance naked
in the square.

499
00:29:34,419 --> 00:29:36,662
Until then,
No deal.

500
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:51,228
If he's delivering

501
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,818
A kilo of plutonium,

502
00:29:54,801 --> 00:29:56,880
He''ll have it
Divided up

503
00:29:56,942 --> 00:29:59,275
Into 15 to 20

504
00:29:59,815 --> 00:30:01,636
Individual pigs.

505
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:10,784
Your man has
90 seconds exposure

506
00:30:11,992 --> 00:30:13,284
Before

507
00:30:13,401 --> 00:30:15,679
he risks radiation poisoning.

508
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,173
But he has to test it.

509
00:30:17,196 --> 00:30:19,284
More than one pig.

510
00:30:20,182 --> 00:30:23,616
Sometimes, they'll
Offer up one good sample

511
00:30:23,962 --> 00:30:25,512
From a lot of

512
00:30:25,771 --> 00:30:26,995
30 losers.

513
00:30:27,155 --> 00:30:28,783
What's the threshold?

514
00:30:29,499 --> 00:30:31,601
95% purity.

515
00:30:31,636 --> 00:30:33,659
But it's good enough
To make a bomb?

516
00:30:33,695 --> 00:30:34,998
Perhaps.

517
00:30:35,972 --> 00:30:37,172
Perhaps?

518
00:30:37,199 --> 00:30:39,254
If that kid files a complaint
with the principal

519
00:30:39,278 --> 00:30:41,356
- A bogus complaint.
- Any complaint

520
00:30:41,391 --> 00:30:43,965
The school is required
To open an investigation.

521
00:30:43,988 --> 00:30:46,677
They'll dig Into my background,
And they'll Crack my cover,

522
00:30:46,712 --> 00:30:48,709
And that opens the door
on all of us.

523
00:30:48,744 --> 00:30:50,594
You need to slam
That door.

524
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:52,872
Has the boy gone
To the principal?

525
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:55,273
No, but he's got
Me in a corner,

526
00:30:55,314 --> 00:30:56,566
And he knows it.

527
00:30:57,487 --> 00:30:59,418
Tiffy, the first
thing you learn in combat

528
00:30:59,453 --> 00:31:01,461
Is to assess the enemy's
strength.

529
00:31:01,522 --> 00:31:03,645
What's ge got?
I mean, the threat.

530
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,782
An accusation.

531
00:31:04,942 --> 00:31:06,606
The weight
Of his words.

532
00:31:06,818 --> 00:31:09,651
In martial arts, we use the enemy's
own weight against him,

533
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:12,214
Make him extend himself
Until he's off balance.

534
00:31:12,238 --> 00:31:14,786
So you want me
To what, throw him?

535
00:31:15,469 --> 00:31:17,676
Use what he's using
Against himself.

536
00:31:17,735 --> 00:31:19,085
The accusations?

537
00:31:19,132 --> 00:31:20,882
And anything else you
Can bring to bear,

538
00:31:20,929 --> 00:31:22,953
Anything you can
To raise him out.

539
00:31:23,195 --> 00:31:25,261
To get down
On his level.

540
00:31:26,142 --> 00:31:28,056
Break his will To fight.

541
00:31:32,685 --> 00:31:34,564
I wasn't even doing
Anything wrong.

542
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:37,323
I don't care, Lissy.
Stay away from him.

543
00:31:37,358 --> 00:31:38,501
Why?

544
00:31:38,513 --> 00:31:40,051
Because
He's trouble.

545
00:31:40,087 --> 00:31:41,707
Because why,
He's 18?

546
00:31:41,742 --> 00:31:43,083
It's more than that.

547
00:31:44,044 --> 00:31:45,934
He was the only one
who even talked to me

548
00:31:45,969 --> 00:31:47,651
At school today, mom.

549
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,286
Remember
On the bus ride here

550
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:52,728
we were talking
about shared sacrifice,

551
00:31:52,782 --> 00:31:55,381
About making compromises
For the greater good?

552
00:31:56,499 --> 00:31:58,284
This is one
of those sacrifices

553
00:31:58,296 --> 00:32:00,004
I'm asking you
To make,

554
00:32:00,682 --> 00:32:03,914
And i wouldn't ask
If it wasn't important.

555
00:32:05,264 --> 00:32:06,803
It's important.

556
00:32:17,863 --> 00:32:19,617
There they are now.

557
00:32:20,493 --> 00:32:21,417
Good.

558
00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:23,820
I know.

559
00:32:35,301 --> 00:32:36,909
petrov sent us.

560
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:38,635
And where is he?

561
00:32:38,753 --> 00:32:40,482
He said he was coming.

562
00:32:57,263 --> 00:32:58,893
My brother.

563
00:33:05,797 --> 00:33:08,004
I'm here
As requested.

564
00:33:09,155 --> 00:33:10,751
Let's make this quick.

565
00:33:10,963 --> 00:33:13,114
Nato uniforms.
Smart.

566
00:33:13,161 --> 00:33:15,755
It makes the border crossing
Less stressful.

567
00:33:16,166 --> 00:33:17,622
Go ahead.

568
00:33:42,767 --> 00:33:44,239
As promised.

569
00:33:44,486 --> 00:33:46,050
Now it is your turn.

570
00:33:47,339 --> 00:33:49,018
37 million
Is the price.

571
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:51,797
That was the price

572
00:33:52,537 --> 00:33:54,535
Before you fixed
The bidding.

573
00:33:54,826 --> 00:33:56,952
Violence draws
Too much attention.

574
00:33:57,222 --> 00:33:59,500
Authorities
Must be pad off.

575
00:34:02,152 --> 00:34:03,009
So

576
00:34:03,936 --> 00:34:06,627
it is going
To cost you.

577
00:34:06,686 --> 00:34:09,199
Me? I brought you
This money.

578
00:34:09,258 --> 00:34:10,870
You also brought
This danger.

579
00:34:10,917 --> 00:34:12,208
Take it from his cut.

580
00:34:12,228 --> 00:34:13,888
No. He has
No more cut.

581
00:34:14,357 --> 00:34:17,558
He owes me,
Or no deal for anyone.

582
00:34:17,718 --> 00:34:20,377
- What do you want?
- Whatever is his.

583
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,188
Drugs, girls.

584
00:34:22,255 --> 00:34:24,545
I am just
A small businessman.

585
00:34:24,596 --> 00:34:26,580
but you of course
Have something

586
00:34:26,603 --> 00:34:28,658
That you've saved
For a rainy day.

587
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:32,727
No? Fine.
You want us To find out

588
00:34:32,762 --> 00:34:34,465
For ourselves?

589
00:34:35,967 --> 00:34:38,413
Petrov, you don't
Want to do this.

590
00:34:38,492 --> 00:34:39,706
What is this?

591
00:34:41,865 --> 00:34:44,390
The cost of doing
Business.

592
00:34:50,002 --> 00:34:53,161
Cool breeze, something's going down.
They got guns on snake doc.

593
00:34:54,241 --> 00:34:55,944
What's with the soldiers
In the club?

594
00:34:55,979 --> 00:34:57,505
I don't know.

595
00:34:57,646 --> 00:34:58,906
What now?

596
00:34:58,941 --> 00:35:00,538
We just
We hang back.

597
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:02,061
We want
That plutonium.

598
00:35:07,115 --> 00:35:09,992
You were holding out
On us, dragan.

599
00:35:11,236 --> 00:35:13,888
I will take all of the girls
as payment.

600
00:35:13,935 --> 00:35:16,025
that's too far.
These girls are mine.

601
00:35:16,061 --> 00:35:19,021
If you want to drop out
This deal over them, do it!

602
00:35:19,071 --> 00:35:20,946
- That's enough!
- really?

603
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:22,874
Because you say so?

604
00:35:25,191 --> 00:35:26,917
Let us conclude
Our business here.

605
00:35:26,944 --> 00:35:29,656
Forget This business.
Forget your money.

606
00:35:29,715 --> 00:35:31,864
I can find
Other buyers.

607
00:35:31,899 --> 00:35:34,453
37 million, and you still
need the girls?

608
00:35:34,488 --> 00:35:36,144
Well, it's
My commission.

609
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:37,860
You can't have my girls
Without paying.

610
00:35:37,907 --> 00:35:39,187
I want to close
This deal.

611
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:40,925
And i'd like
To go home!

612
00:35:41,912 --> 00:35:43,897
If he won't give them,
shoot them.

613
00:35:43,944 --> 00:35:45,247
Wait!

614
00:35:45,904 --> 00:35:48,182
- Sell me the girls.
- What?

615
00:35:48,811 --> 00:35:51,605
Done. Now they're mine.

616
00:35:53,648 --> 00:35:55,527
And now yours

617
00:35:58,597 --> 00:36:00,300
Give me the keys.

618
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:01,621
We swap.

619
00:36:05,718 --> 00:36:07,502
Fine transaction.

620
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:36,949
I hope your country
Appreciates

621
00:36:36,988 --> 00:36:39,007
Your patriotism.

622
00:36:40,722 --> 00:36:42,495
I hope so, too.

623
00:36:53,016 --> 00:36:55,259
Tell dirt diver
Pick off the saab.

624
00:36:55,271 --> 00:36:57,802
I want petrov.
I don't care how.

625
00:36:58,291 --> 00:37:00,510
What about the money?
We go after the truck?

626
00:37:00,557 --> 00:37:01,919
No. We can't.

627
00:37:02,001 --> 00:37:04,208
We got to secure
The plutonium first.

628
00:37:04,363 --> 00:37:06,160
Then we get the truck back

629
00:37:14,026 --> 00:37:15,014
Push it.

630
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:17,530
- They could have crossed over by now.
- Come on. Push it!

631
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,566
The border's only
6 klicks out.

632
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:23,483
We can make it.

633
00:37:26,715 --> 00:37:28,833
Tell snake doc
It's over.

634
00:37:32,026 --> 00:37:34,448
Didn't leave me
A choice.

635
00:37:34,507 --> 00:37:36,583
What about the truck?
What about the girl?

636
00:37:36,625 --> 00:37:39,084
<i>Negative. No girls
Here, doc.</i>

637
00:37:46,817 --> 00:37:48,685
We got petrov.

638
00:37:48,878 --> 00:37:50,123
Good.

639
00:37:50,593 --> 00:37:52,378
Did he say anything?

640
00:37:52,418 --> 00:37:54,068
About you?

641
00:37:55,219 --> 00:37:57,051
What do you want,
Colonel?

642
00:37:57,106 --> 00:37:59,617
I want to know
Who hired you and why.

643
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:02,448
Petrov sells nuclear materials
to the highest bidder.

644
00:38:02,472 --> 00:38:04,256
He doesn't care
Who wants them and why.

645
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,041
Nor does he hire
Academics like you.

646
00:38:06,088 --> 00:38:08,617
To vet his isotopes when any
Out-of-work russian lab rat

647
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:10,252
Can do it
On the cheap.

648
00:38:10,287 --> 00:38:13,176
He was paid to get you
bomb-grade plutonium,

649
00:38:13,246 --> 00:38:16,151
And i'm asking you
One more time for whom.

650
00:38:16,212 --> 00:38:19,051
Why don't you
Ask petrov?

651
00:38:19,112 --> 00:38:20,310
Petrov's dead.

652
00:38:20,345 --> 00:38:22,553
Well, so am i.

653
00:38:23,903 --> 00:38:25,751
Not yet, you're not.

654
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:28,984
Save what's left
Of your life.

655
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:32,318
It's not my life
That matters now.

656
00:39:06,184 --> 00:39:08,838
I made a mistake
Not coming to you first,

657
00:39:08,873 --> 00:39:11,418
But being new here, I just didn't want
To be hard on the boy.

658
00:39:11,479 --> 00:39:14,321
but you were clear with him
about the Sexual harassment?

659
00:39:14,368 --> 00:39:17,240
In no uncertain terms.
That's why he Came after me

660
00:39:17,268 --> 00:39:19,049
And threatened me
With physical violence

661
00:39:19,072 --> 00:39:20,340
When i said no,

662
00:39:20,387 --> 00:39:22,151
And frankly, i'm still
A little scared.

663
00:39:22,178 --> 00:39:25,199
These days, You have to take
Every potential Threat seriously.

664
00:39:25,266 --> 00:39:27,534
- Absolutely.
- Excuse me, mrs. Green. You're needed

665
00:39:27,581 --> 00:39:30,117
Right away At the east entrance.
There's A serious situation.

666
00:39:31,051 --> 00:39:32,384
Excuse me.

667
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,022
What happened?

668
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,903
- Mrs green It's not mine.
- What?

669
00:39:43,939 --> 00:39:46,263
The metal detector Went off.
We found a handgun On him.

670
00:39:46,287 --> 00:39:48,510
It's not mine, I swear.
I don't know how it got in there.

671
00:39:48,533 --> 00:39:51,656
In the office.
Get the police Down here. Now.

672
00:39:59,951 --> 00:40:01,427
Thank you.

673
00:40:03,118 --> 00:40:04,785
For the greater good.

674
00:40:07,026 --> 00:40:08,850
Who else got
These brochures?

675
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,450
They're only
For the show room.

676
00:40:10,482 --> 00:40:12,513
We received a hundred
For display.

677
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,725
Then why does my new employer
have one?

678
00:40:15,783 --> 00:40:18,284
One of those?
Are you sure?

679
00:40:18,331 --> 00:40:19,952
Saw it right
On his desk.

680
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:22,017
The number
Was circled.

681
00:40:22,065 --> 00:40:24,225
A voice on the phone
Tells me to interview with him,

682
00:40:24,249 --> 00:40:26,210
And he's got
This in his house.

683
00:40:26,245 --> 00:40:28,309
- Who is he?
- His name's Isaac reed.

684
00:40:28,339 --> 00:40:30,329
He's in The import/export
Business.

685
00:40:30,352 --> 00:40:31,961
Why would he have
A brochure from us

686
00:40:31,984 --> 00:40:34,113
When we don't
Technically exist yet?

687
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,109
You know anything
More about him?

688
00:40:36,145 --> 00:40:38,022
Just that his wife's
In the same company.

689
00:40:38,086 --> 00:40:41,092
She travels a lot.
You haven't met The wife?

690
00:40:42,313 --> 00:40:44,684
Do you think you can get
Back into his office?

691
00:40:44,873 --> 00:40:46,168
I don't see why not.

692
00:40:46,204 --> 00:40:48,650
He's already left
Me alone once In the house.

693
00:40:48,716 --> 00:40:49,931
He trusts you.

694
00:40:49,978 --> 00:40:52,588
More than that. For a man
Whose wife's Out of town,

695
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,784
He's a little Too friendly,
If you know What i mean.

696
00:40:54,831 --> 00:40:57,124
- I think she should Call the colonel.
- Don't

697
00:40:57,379 --> 00:40:59,752
It's probably
Just another test.

698
00:40:59,775 --> 00:41:02,152
Maybe i wasn't
Supposed to notice The brochure,

699
00:41:02,211 --> 00:41:03,561
But the better Guess

700
00:41:03,585 --> 00:41:05,393
Our landing In this town
With these jobs

701
00:41:05,405 --> 00:41:06,708
Is no accident.

702
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:08,511
- I don't understand.
- Neither do i,

703
00:41:08,892 --> 00:41:10,418
But i'm going to.

704
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:33,750
No one.

705
00:41:33,817 --> 00:41:35,017
Gone.

706
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:45,884
Over here.

707
00:41:48,217 --> 00:41:49,251
Tire treads.

708
00:41:49,461 --> 00:41:51,419
They switched
Vehicles.

709
00:41:51,443 --> 00:41:53,181
Maybe a van.
Put the girls in there,

710
00:41:53,204 --> 00:41:54,318
Drove off.

711
00:41:54,355 --> 00:41:56,351
They could be
Anywhere by now.

712
00:42:03,917 --> 00:42:06,013
You made the only choice
You could.

713
00:42:06,071 --> 00:42:08,044
Is that right?

714
00:42:08,279 --> 00:42:10,614
You had to get
The plutonium.

715
00:42:11,036 --> 00:42:14,368
Think of the lives
You saved.

716
00:42:15,486 --> 00:42:18,410
You had to buy the girls,
Hand them over, or else--

717
00:42:18,445 --> 00:42:21,520
You know what?
Why don't you stop talking?

718
00:42:21,708 --> 00:42:23,047
It doesn't help.

719
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:49,157
