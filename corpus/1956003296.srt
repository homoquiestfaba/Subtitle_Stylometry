1
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,780
What did you eat?

2
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:07,043
You had rations for two weeks.

3
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,286
You were inside for nearly four months.

4
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:11,739
I don't remember eating.

5
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:16,835
How long did you think you were inside?

6
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,251
Days.

7
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:23,008
Maybe weeks.

8
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:29,006
What happened to Josie Radek?

9
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,350
I don't know.
What about Sheppard?

10
00:01:40,142 --> 00:01:41,519
Thorensen?

11
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:45,943
Dead.

12
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:47,695
Ventress?

13
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,289
I don't know.

14
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:57,368
Then what do you know?

15
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:56,680
<i>This is a cell.</i>

16
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:58,780
<i>Like all cells,</i>

17
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:01,353
<i>it is born from an existing cell.</i>

18
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,493
<i>And by extension,</i>

19
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:07,021
<i>all cells were ultimately born
from one cell.</i>

20
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,277
A single organism

21
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:13,160
alone on Planet Earth,
perhaps alone in the universe.

22
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,696
About four billion years ago

23
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,329
one became two. Two became four.

24
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,170
Then eight, 16, 32.

25
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:26,086
The rhythm of the dividing pair,

26
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,292
which becomes

27
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:31,312
the structure of every microbe,

28
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:34,482
blade of grass, sea creature,
land creature,

29
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:35,723
and human.

30
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:39,307
The structure of everything that lives

31
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,143
and everything that dies.

32
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:46,285
As students of medicine,
as the doctors of tomorrow,

33
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:47,811
this is where you come in.

34
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,457
The cell we're looking at

35
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,625
is from a tumor.

36
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,419
Female patient, early thirties,

37
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:56,504
taken from the cervix.

38
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:58,089
Over the course of the next term,

39
00:03:58,113 --> 00:04:01,008
we will be closely examining
cancer cells in vitro

40
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:03,000
and discussing autophagic activity.

41
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:04,929
Professor?

42
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,013
Hi, Katie.

43
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,210
I read the John
Sulston paper last night.

44
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,268
I still feel I'm not working
hard enough.

45
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:13,020
I'm behind the other students,
they find everything easier.

46
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:14,564
You aren't, and they don't, okay?

47
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:15,805
Lena!

48
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,016
Dan.

49
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:20,737
I've been looking for you at lunch,

50
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,604
but you never seem to be around.

51
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,949
I've been catching up on some writing.

52
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,326
All work and no play. It's...

53
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,567
Not healthy.

54
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:33,607
I wanted to ask,
do you have plans Saturday?

55
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,711
Sarah and I have a few people over.

56
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,737
A garden party while the weather holds.

57
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,032
Actually, I do have plans.

58
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:43,718
I think it'll be a lot of fun.

59
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:45,219
Thanks, Dan, I really appreciate it,

60
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:47,120
but I'm going to paint our bed...

61
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,294
The bedroom.

62
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,835
It's been a year, Lena.

63
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,398
You're allowed to come to a barbecue.

64
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,734
It is not a betrayal

65
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:01,886
or an insult to his memory.

66
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,060
I'm gonna paint the bedroom.

67
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:56,712
Oh, God.

68
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,718
Oh, my God.

69
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,525
I thought you were gone

70
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:17,562
forever.

71
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,118
Kane?

72
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:47,485
No one knew anything about your unit.

73
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,362
I contacted everyone.

74
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:51,197
Everyone I could.

75
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:53,565
The other partners
knew just as little as me.

76
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,192
Was it covert?

77
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,283
Mmm. Maybe.

78
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,029
What's that mean, "Maybe"?

79
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:12,121
Okay, yeah. It was covert,
yeah, I think so.

80
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,122
Pakistan again?

81
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:20,171
I don't know where it was,

82
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,479
or what it was.

83
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,897
How is that possible?

84
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,265
Was... Was it warm?

85
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:28,800
Was there snow?

86
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,237
Did the people there speak Portuguese,

87
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,855
or Swahili, or Pashto?

88
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,523
How long have you been back?

89
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,123
I don't know.

90
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:44,741
How'd you get back?
What base did you fly into?

91
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,128
I don't know.

92
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:48,337
What about the rest of your unit?

93
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,578
Did they come back with you?

94
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,251
You must be able to tell me something.

95
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:58,931
You vanished off the face
of the Earth for 12 months.

96
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,142
I deserve a better explanation
than no explanation.

97
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,634
Does it matter?

98
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,570
Kane,

99
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,819
how did you get home?

100
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,666
I was outside.

101
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:37,665
Outside the house?

102
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,667
No.

103
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,332
No, I was outside the room.

104
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,340
The room with the bed.

105
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,006
The door was open,

106
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:53,010
and I saw you.

107
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,765
I recognized you.

108
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:03,566
Your face.

109
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,786
I don't feel very well.

110
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,297
Stay with me, baby.

111
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,173
I'm right here with you.

112
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:34,735
Male, 31, hemorrhage, in seizure.

113
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,238
Stay with me, baby. I love you.

114
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:39,606
Baby, look at me. Can you do something?

115
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:45,061
You call for a police escort?

116
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:55,864
Easy, easy!

117
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:10,479
Out of the truck now!
Out!

118
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,380
Out of the truck now!
What are you doing?

119
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:15,266
Move! Out, out!
Don't shoot!

120
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:18,011
Out, out, out!
What is going on?

121
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:19,738
Do not move!
What are you doing?

122
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:20,990
You can't move him.

123
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,858
Let him go! Let him go!

124
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,192
Let him go!

125
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:29,507
You must be feeling dreadful.

126
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:33,177
It's a hangover from
the sedative you were given.

127
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,179
Come on, sit down.

128
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,019
Who are you?

129
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,943
My name is Dr. Ventress.

130
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,366
I'm a psychologist.

131
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,952
Why am I talking to a psychologist?

132
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,966
Am I in a psychiatric hospital?

133
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,038
No.
Then what?

134
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:05,918
Where am I?

135
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:07,787
Where's my husband?

136
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,837
You served in the military
for seven years.

137
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:15,771
I'm a professor from Johns Hopkins.

138
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,218
I want to know
what the fuck I'm doing here.

139
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:19,650
Your research area

140
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:22,945
is the genetically programed
life cycle of a cell.

141
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:24,446
Where is my husband?

142
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,474
Yeah, I'd like to talk
about Sergeant Kane.

143
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,818
When did he arrive back home?

144
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,355
I want to see a lawyer.

145
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,741
You're not gonna be able
to see a lawyer.

146
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:43,414
Did he explain how he got back?

147
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:45,759
No.

148
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:49,128
Did he contact you
at any point while he was away?

149
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:50,663
No.

150
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,926
What did he tell you about
his mission when he returned?

151
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,603
Nothing.

152
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:57,896
What about before he left?

153
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,690
Did he ever mention where he was going,

154
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:00,774
what he was doing?

155
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,651
He never said, I never asked.

156
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,820
But you made regular requests

157
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,597
for information from his unit CO

158
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:10,726
until six months ago,
and then you stopped.

159
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:14,228
Why was that?

160
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:18,025
Thought he was dead? Time to move on?

161
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,365
It's not easy to move on.

162
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,539
I didn't.

163
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:35,208
I'm done answering questions.
It's your turn.

164
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,044
Your husband's here.

165
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:41,148
He's extremely ill.

166
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:44,016
In what way?
Multiple organ failure.

167
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:47,262
Massive internal bleeding.

168
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:52,067
He must have been exposed
to some sort of radiation,

169
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,060
some kind of virus.

170
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:55,746
You have to tell me where he was,

171
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,147
what he was doing.

172
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:02,406
I could actually help him.

173
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,531
<i>A religious event?</i>

174
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:51,622
<i>An extraterrestrial event?</i>

175
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:53,999
<i>A higher dimension?</i>

176
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:56,723
We have many theories.

177
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,590
Few facts.

178
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,687
It started around three years ago.

179
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:04,731
Blackwater National Park
reported that a lighthouse

180
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:07,109
was surrounded by something they termed

181
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,476
a "Shimmer."

182
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:12,305
One of the wardens
went in to investigate.

183
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:14,436
Never returned.

184
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:17,619
The event was classified.

185
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,330
Since then, we've approached
by land, by sea,

186
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:24,234
sent in drones, animals,
and teams of people.

187
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,452
But nothing comes back.

188
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:29,882
And the boundary's
getting bigger, it's expanding.

189
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:32,634
So far, it's eating into
barely populated swampland,

190
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:36,054
which we evacuated under the pretext

191
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:38,223
of a chemical spill,

192
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,874
but that won't last much longer.

193
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,144
In a few months,

194
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:45,923
the area will have grown
to where we are right now.

195
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:51,053
And then we're talking cities,

196
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:53,263
states,

197
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,357
and so on.

198
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,361
You say nothing comes back.

199
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,689
But something has.

200
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,782
Yes.

201
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:15,668
He's dying.

202
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,503
Yes.

203
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:23,393
We need to come to an agreement

204
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:24,919
about what to do with you.

205
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,547
You're not going to let me go home?

206
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:33,344
Is that what you want? To go home?

207
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:38,687
No.

208
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,276
I want to be with him.

209
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,956
You're not talking to me.

210
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:04,880
Sorry.

211
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:07,629
Zoned out.

212
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,973
Thinking about the next mission?

213
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:14,476
No.

214
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:17,388
I was just looking at the moon.

215
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:22,569
It's always so weird
seeing it like that in the daylight.

216
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,289
Like God made a mistake.

217
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:26,565
Left the hall lights on.

218
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,191
God doesn't make mistakes.

219
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,827
That's somewhat
key to the whole being-a-god thing.

220
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:35,411
Pretty sure He does.

221
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,667
You know He's listening
right now, don't you?

222
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,931
You take a cell,
circumvent the Hayflick limit,

223
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,207
you can prevent senescence.

224
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,894
I was about to make
the exact same point.

225
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:49,730
It means the cell doesn't grow old,

226
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:50,897
it becomes immortal.

227
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,389
Keeps dividing, doesn't die.

228
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:57,404
We see aging as a natural process,

229
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:59,726
but it's actually a fault in our genes.

230
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:03,535
I get really turned on
when you patronize me.

231
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:04,620
It's really hot.

232
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:07,581
Without it, I could keep
looking like this forever.

233
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:10,950
Oh. Okay, well, that could
constitute a mistake.

234
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:19,458
You didn't tell me where
you're heading this time.

235
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,539
I know there's something
strange about this mission.

236
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:28,376
Why?

237
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:33,639
The silence around it
is louder than usual.

238
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:38,970
Kind of angling for a clue here.

239
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,316
So...

240
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,151
We'll be under the same hemisphere.

241
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:53,576
What does that tell me?

242
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:58,740
It tells you that
if you step outside and you look up,

243
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,885
we'll be looking at the same stars.

244
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,720
Holy fucking shit.

245
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,013
What?
Are you kidding?

246
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,098
What?

247
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:08,090
You think that's what I do
while you're away?

248
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:09,518
What?

249
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,353
You think I'm out in the garden,

250
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:13,880
pining. Looking up at the sky?

251
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,982
Shut up.

252
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:18,360
Oh, to think my beloved Kane...

253
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:19,444
All right. Okay.

254
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:22,392
is looking at this selfsame moon.

255
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:23,699
Stop it.

256
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:27,353
Oh, my distant
celestial friend...

257
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,229
No, no!

258
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:32,290
Please care for my brave soldier.

259
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,543
Jesus! You know what?
You are disrespectful, seriously.

260
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,878
Not only to your
former comrades in the armed forces,

261
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,046
but also to the President.

262
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,131
You forgot the flag.

263
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:42,008
Oh, I'm getting
to the motherfucking flag.

264
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:43,218
Oh, my hero!

265
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,244
Screw you.
Okay.

266
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:56,440
She's all by herself.

267
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:58,567
Don't you think we should make friends?

268
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:00,235
Well, obviously you should.

269
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,351
Yep, I'll do it.

270
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,348
Hey.

271
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:08,076
Hey.

272
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,694
Am I intruding?
No, not at all.

273
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:13,106
Cool. Phew!

274
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,945
You know, always see you here alone.

275
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,296
I'm guessing you probably feel

276
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,539
weird or awkward.

277
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:24,705
Somewhat, I guess.

278
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:28,337
Don't. Seriously, don't.

279
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:30,515
The people here put themselves

280
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:31,808
to sleep in the fetal position,

281
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,550
making cooing noises.

282
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,799
It's freaky, you know.

283
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:38,523
I'm Anya.

284
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:39,639
Lena.

285
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,943
Nice to meet you.
You, too.

286
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:45,071
Um... Why don't you come
and meet my crew?

287
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,893
Come make friends. Come on.

288
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,726
Ladies, meet Lena.

289
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:52,954
Hi. Nice to meet you.
Hi. Nice to meet you.

290
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,791
Yeah, that's Cassie Sheppard
and Josie Radek.

291
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:57,375
Hi.
Hi. Nice to meet you.

292
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,072
Do you want to have a seat?

293
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:00,796
Thank you.

294
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,923
So, first day at the Southern Reach.

295
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:03,994
Yes.

296
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:07,164
Thank you.
You're welcome.

297
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,378
You all been here a long time?

298
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:12,390
Urn... Yeah, right from the start.

299
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:13,809
I'm a geomorphologist.

300
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:17,145
I've been testing
the magnetic fields around the boundary.

301
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,469
Which is like
using confetti to test a hurricane.

302
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:23,652
Uh... And I've been here

303
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:26,321
10 months? Wow, ten months!

304
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,906
Paramedic from Chicago.

305
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,616
Tried to join an NGO,
but my application got flagged,

306
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,660
so Southern Reach got me.

307
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:32,685
Only two months.

308
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,162
I'm a physicist.

309
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:37,082
I came straight from
my Cambridge post-doc.

310
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:38,608
She's very smart.

311
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,169
What's your story, Lena?

312
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,547
I'm from Johns Hopkins. Biologist.

313
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:45,382
Oh, there you go.
Ha! Biologist?

314
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:46,883
Told you she was smart.
What?

315
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,218
We had a bet on your profession,

316
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:50,290
and Josie had "biologist," of course.

317
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:55,392
I had "law enforcement."
I had you as single.

318
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:58,144
Jesus! Do you have
to hit on everyone, like all the time?

319
00:22:58,168 --> 00:22:59,771
Come on. Fuck that.
Under the circumstances,

320
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:02,264
I think I'm allowed
to roll the dice a few more times.

321
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:04,800
Under what circumstances?

322
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:10,731
Well, yeah, urn, crazy as it seems...

323
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,229
Crazy as it is.

324
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:17,734
We are headed that way.

325
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:24,004
You're going into the Shimmer?

326
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:25,200
Six days and counting.

327
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,991
You three?
Four.

328
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:30,492
Ventress.

329
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,221
Dr. Ventress?

330
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,247
Mmm. Team leader.

331
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,226
All women.
Scientists.

332
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,220
The previous teams
have been largely military, so yeah.

333
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,598
What do you think happened to them?

334
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:46,818
Well, there are two theories

335
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,685
of what went wrong in the Shimmer.

336
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:51,031
One, something kills them.

337
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:53,683
Two, they go crazy and kill each other.

338
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,537
There was one military
guy who made it out.

339
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:58,608
SHEPPARD: Yeah.

340
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:00,081
Sergeant.

341
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,324
Yeah, but you heard about
the state that he was in.

342
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:51,490
Kane,

343
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,666
I know why you went in.

344
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,256
I am so sorry.

345
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:11,848
And I know what I have to do.

346
00:25:15,556 --> 00:25:17,325
<i>So, you didn't tell them
about your connection</i>

347
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,896
<i>to Sergeant Kane.</i>

348
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:22,272
I thought it would complicate things.

349
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:23,856
What?

350
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,738
What would it complicate?

351
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:35,330
Why are you going into the Shimmer?

352
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,389
The mission statement is to

353
00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:42,892
reach the supposed source of
the Shimmer, the lighthouse.

354
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:46,966
Enter, acquire data, and return.

355
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:51,718
But I don't think
that that's your mission statement.

356
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:58,399
No.

357
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:09,945
I've been watching
the phenomenon for a while now.

358
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,909
I profile the volunteers.

359
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:16,417
I pick the teams.

360
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,164
They enter. I watch.

361
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:26,088
I watch it grow closer.

362
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:31,049
There's only so long one can do that.

363
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,976
But you need to know what's inside?

364
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:38,890
Yes. I do.

365
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,943
So do I.

366
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:46,105
So that's the complication.

367
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:48,733
You want to come with us.

368
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,698
I can't do anything for him here.

369
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:56,119
Soldier-scientist.

370
00:26:56,949 --> 00:27:00,624
You can fight. You can learn.

371
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,961
You can save him.

372
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:13,608
You requested to join the mission.

373
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,610
You knew all other missions had failed,

374
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:18,763
and the only survivor
was barely surviving.

375
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,018
That was a brave choice.

376
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,142
Lowed him.

377
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,733
I'm only trying to understand
what drove you.

378
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,405
Lowed him.

379
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:36,330
So I went in.

380
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,825
And then we get some real meals.

381
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:26,742
Spaghetti. Here's Radek's
vegetable crackers.

382
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,004
Huh. Cornbread. That's not so bad.

383
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,336
Oh, you're finally awake.

384
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:36,672
Got to give me a second.
I'm a little disoriented.

385
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:38,424
Join the club.

386
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:41,052
You don't remember
setting up camp, do you?

387
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:44,848
I don't remember anything

388
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:47,020
after we reached the tree line.

389
00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:49,139
None of us do.

390
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:51,826
And we did a food inventory.

391
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,662
From the depletion,
it looks like we've been out here for

392
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,780
at least three or four days.

393
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,316
That's not possible.

394
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:01,451
That's what I said.

395
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:08,092
Guys, I've been checking
my comms and nav equipment.

396
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,386
They boot up fine, no problem
with the electronics,

397
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,013
and the camera is working,

398
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:14,974
but anything that sends
a signal out of the Shimmer

399
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:16,215
is down.

400
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:18,644
Even though we've probably
got about 20 satellites

401
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:21,046
above us right now. And check this out.

402
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:26,486
So we have got

403
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:29,354
no compass, no comms, no coordinates,

404
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,407
and no landmarks.

405
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:33,368
Well, we know we're in the state park.

406
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:36,662
We head south, hit the ocean,
then just follow the shoreline

407
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:37,747
until we hit the perimeter wall.

408
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:38,863
Right?

409
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:40,958
How do we know what's south?

410
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:42,655
Come on, Josie, you know this.

411
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:44,744
Hour hand at the sun.

412
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:48,160
Split the difference between
the hour hand and 12.

413
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:49,282
South.

414
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:52,373
Good. We're oriented.

415
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:53,930
We weren't really expecting

416
00:31:53,954 --> 00:31:56,265
the comms equipment to work, were we?

417
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:58,184
I mean, there's been
three years of expeditions

418
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:00,006
and three years of radio silence.

419
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:03,089
Let's pack up and get moving.

420
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,758
We've already lost a lot of the day.

421
00:33:06,193 --> 00:33:07,378
Oh, I'm gonna check this out.

422
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,172
Get us out of this damn swamp.

423
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:10,243
All right.

424
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,620
Let's check out the hut.

425
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,808
Looks like someone's about
to have a wedding.

426
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,142
These are very strange.

427
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,522
Why?

428
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,207
They're all so different.

429
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:45,750
To look at them, you wouldn't say

430
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:47,947
that they're the same species.

431
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:51,071
But they're growing from
the same branch structure.

432
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:54,884
So it has to be the same species.

433
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:56,501
It's the same plant.

434
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:00,389
It's like they're stuck
in a continuous mutation.

435
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:01,585
A pathology?

436
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:03,841
Yeah, well,

437
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:07,480
you'd sure as hell call it a pathology

438
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:09,347
if you saw this in a human.

439
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:21,827
Jackpot.

440
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:22,943
Sheppard.

441
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:24,650
Mode of transportation.

442
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:31,244
Anything interesting in there?

443
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:34,953
No. It's been long abandoned,
maybe even before...

444
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:37,041
Radek?

445
00:34:38,285 --> 00:34:39,537
Radek!

446
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:42,765
Radek!
It's got my bag!

447
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:44,086
Radek!

448
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:49,550
Something's got my bag!

449
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:52,716
It's got my bag!

450
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,643
Josie, what's happening?
What's going on?

451
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:02,897
Grab my shoulder!

452
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:07,564
Get her. Come on.

453
00:35:08,982 --> 00:35:10,154
I got her!

454
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:14,362
You're good. You're good.

455
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:16,035
Okay.

456
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:25,600
Let's sit you down.
Help me with her bag.

457
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:28,185
Okay, just breathe.
It's okay, you're just fine.

458
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:30,382
What the hell happened?
Something in the water.

459
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:43,649
Get up! Get up! Go.

460
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:55,237
Shit! Get back.

461
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:00,950
Sheppard!

462
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:02,790
Sheppard, watch out!

463
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:07,795
Holy fuck!

464
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:50,549
Whoa.

465
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:54,846
It's exactly the same as the flowers.

466
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:57,341
Look at the teeth.

467
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:00,059
Concentric rows.

468
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:03,814
Something here is making
giant waves in the gene pool.

469
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,991
Sharks have teeth like that, don't they?

470
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:08,268
Do you think it's a crossbreed?

471
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:12,777
You can't crossbreed
between different species.

472
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:17,785
Lena, this is getting heavy.

473
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:30,131
The mutations were subtle at first.

474
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,544
More extreme as we grew
closer to the lighthouse.

475
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:38,052
Corruptions of form.

476
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:41,110
Duplicates of form.

477
00:37:41,134 --> 00:37:42,477
Duplicates?

478
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:46,981
Echoes.

479
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,939
Is it possible
these were hallucinations?

480
00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:58,072
I wondered that myself.

481
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:01,909
But they were shared among all of us.

482
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,746
It was dreamlike.

483
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:08,419
Nightmarish?

484
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:10,497
Not always.

485
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:14,838
Sometimes it was beautiful.

486
00:38:42,946 --> 00:38:44,340
You hurt?

487
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:46,366
It's just a bruise.

488
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:49,665
Must have gotten that from the gator.

489
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:51,211
Yeah.

490
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:58,045
So, where'd you learn to shoot?

491
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:02,966
I was in the military
before I was an academic.

492
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,069
Marines?

493
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:07,141
Army. Seven years.

494
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:09,782
Feels like a lifetime ago now.

495
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:10,807
Yeah.

496
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:14,728
All other lives
feel like a lifetime ago.

497
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,314
We were kids, I was married.

498
00:39:18,648 --> 00:39:20,543
Which do you carry around your neck?

499
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:22,319
A husband or a child?

500
00:39:22,652 --> 00:39:23,824
Husband.

501
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:28,913
He was in the Army, too.
That's... That's how we met.

502
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:31,453
"Was" in the Army? He quit?

503
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:34,163
K.I.A.

504
00:39:36,249 --> 00:39:37,751
I'm sorry to hear that.

505
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,355
Guess there had to be something.

506
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:42,676
What do you mean?

507
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:47,486
Volunteering for this.

508
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:50,239
It's not exactly something
you do if your life is in

509
00:39:50,263 --> 00:39:51,765
perfect harmony.

510
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:55,898
We're all damaged goods here.

511
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:58,271
Anya is sober,

512
00:39:58,605 --> 00:40:00,249
therefore an addict.

513
00:40:00,273 --> 00:40:02,418
And Josie wears long sleeves

514
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:03,627
because she doesn't want you to see

515
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:05,254
the scars on her forearms.

516
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:07,506
She's tried to kill herself?

517
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:10,704
No, I think the opposite.
Trying to feel alive.

518
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:14,370
Ventress?

519
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:18,462
Yeah. As far as anyone knows,

520
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:23,134
no friends, no family,
no partner, no children.

521
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:26,300
No concession in her at all.

522
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:29,594
You?

523
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:32,388
I also lost someone.

524
00:40:34,641 --> 00:40:36,744
Not a husband, though. Um...

525
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:39,066
A daughter. Leukemia.

526
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:41,443
God, I'm sorry.

527
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:44,154
In a way, it's two bereavements.

528
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:48,781
My beautiful girl

529
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:52,217
and the person I once was.

530
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:53,413
Hey, hey.

531
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,833
We got something here.

532
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:28,504
This used to be the headquarters

533
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:30,030
of the Southern Reach

534
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,828
before the Shimmer swallowed it.

535
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:37,746
More mutations.

536
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:40,210
They're everywhere.

537
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:42,546
Malignant.

538
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:44,718
Like tumors.

539
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:47,856
Is that the old mess hall?

540
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,941
Yeah.

541
00:41:48,965 --> 00:41:51,468
Let's billet there. Come on.

542
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:30,173
There's beds and bags.
You think people are here?

543
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,183
Were here.

544
00:42:33,009 --> 00:42:35,011
Yeah, I'm gonna go with the past tense.

545
00:42:55,782 --> 00:42:56,783
Damn.

546
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:01,370
Oh.

547
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,541
Oh, shit.

548
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:16,803
This shit is heavy. Can't carry this.

549
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:34,529
Lena, what you got going on?

550
00:43:36,656 --> 00:43:38,249
Guys, check this out.

551
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:42,662
Peyton. Mayer.

552
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:46,708
Kane. Shelley.

553
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:49,419
Those were the soldiers
on the last expedition.

554
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:51,021
Looks like they were using this room

555
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:52,648
as their base of operations.

556
00:43:52,672 --> 00:43:54,566
Why are some of the names crossed out?

557
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:56,235
Let's not jump to conclusions.

558
00:43:56,259 --> 00:43:57,653
I don't know, maybe we should.

559
00:43:57,677 --> 00:43:58,769
Yeah.

560
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:00,864
This is a plan-view of the base, right?

561
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:02,533
Yep. This is the mess hall.

562
00:44:02,557 --> 00:44:04,034
That's the building we're in?
Yep.

563
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:05,577
I think that the times by the names

564
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:07,496
are a guard rota,

565
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,623
so if they were guarding
the perimeter, we should, too.

566
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,524
Copy that.
Yep.

567
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,714
This might be able to tell us something.

568
00:44:30,293 --> 00:44:32,637
"For those that follow."

569
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:36,473
I believe that means us.

570
00:44:44,974 --> 00:44:46,647
Memory card.

571
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:50,984
I should be able to play this.

572
00:44:58,154 --> 00:44:59,497
It's working.

573
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:04,911
<i>All right?</i>

574
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:12,561
<i>Okay?
Okay.</i>

575
00:45:12,585 --> 00:45:13,632
<i>Okay.</i>

576
00:45:23,763 --> 00:45:26,107
Okay. Okay. Okay.
Okay.

577
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:27,775
Ready? Okay.

578
00:45:42,615 --> 00:45:43,958
Shit.

579
00:45:44,492 --> 00:45:45,994
What is he doing?

580
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:56,804
No, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

581
00:45:57,964 --> 00:45:59,261
Hold him. Hold him down.

582
00:46:03,803 --> 00:46:05,555
There. There.

583
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:23,715
Okay. So we know
what happened to the last group,

584
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:24,911
they went insane.

585
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:27,469
There was something alive
inside that man.

586
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:29,096
No, that was a trick of the light.

587
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,180
What?

588
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:31,598
I've been a paramedic for 10 years.
All right?

589
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:33,308
I've scraped people
off the side of the road.

590
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:36,228
You see some weird shit.
That was a trick of the light.

591
00:46:36,252 --> 00:46:37,521
His insides were moving.

592
00:46:37,545 --> 00:46:40,232
No, it was shock, Radek.
That was a shock response.

593
00:46:40,256 --> 00:46:41,316
Watch it again.

594
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:42,818
No, I'm not gonna
fucking watch it again!

595
00:46:42,842 --> 00:46:44,945
That was not intestines.
It was like a worm.

596
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:46,892
Okay, then you watch it, Sheppard!

597
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:52,485
Where are you going?

598
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,830
Where'd she go?
Just ahead.

599
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:06,475
What is it?

600
00:48:07,385 --> 00:48:08,728
I don't know.

601
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:27,839
I don't want to stay here tonight.

602
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:29,285
We don't have a choice.

603
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:33,136
Please.
Come on.

604
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:36,039
It's too late in the day
for us to move on.

605
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:37,832
Come on, let's go outside.

606
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:22,047
Aw, that's nice of you.

607
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:26,389
Why aren't you here?

608
00:49:28,466 --> 00:49:30,389
I got to leave a day early.

609
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:31,726
What?

610
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:34,389
Wait, today?

611
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:37,729
Right now.
Oh, shit.

612
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:39,911
But we had a whole day planned.

613
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:42,313
We were gonna drive to the country.

614
00:49:42,897 --> 00:49:45,320
We can't.
Can you at least...

615
00:49:50,613 --> 00:49:51,956
"Now" means right now?

616
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:56,660
Yeah.

617
00:49:59,914 --> 00:50:01,131
What is it?

618
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:09,682
I do

619
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,603
love you,

620
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:16,430
Lena.

621
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:20,355
I love you, too.

622
00:51:17,241 --> 00:51:18,333
Hey.

623
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:21,579
The mystery unraveling?

624
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:25,337
Something's unraveling.

625
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:27,960
I think you're doing okay.

626
00:51:30,254 --> 00:51:31,940
Look, Josie's getting some rest.

627
00:51:31,964 --> 00:51:33,024
Yeah.

628
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:34,925
With the help of a little sedative.

629
00:51:35,134 --> 00:51:37,557
How about you? Get some sleep?

630
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:39,437
Some.

631
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:42,483
I'm at least as freaked as Josie.

632
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:45,811
I'm just hiding it better.

633
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:50,949
I should check on Ventress.

634
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:53,777
Yep.

635
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:26,369
What are you doing up?

636
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:28,121
You're not supposed to
relieve me until 3:00.

637
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:30,113
I'm done sleeping for the night.

638
00:52:30,648 --> 00:52:31,900
Okay.

639
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:34,777
Come look at this.

640
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:39,449
Okay, this is where we are,

641
00:52:41,033 --> 00:52:42,580
and that's the lighthouse.

642
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:44,929
Southwest is Ville Perdu.

643
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:47,797
It's a small community
we evacuated two years ago.

644
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:51,645
I think we should head there tomorrow,

645
00:52:51,669 --> 00:52:53,146
and then head out for the coast

646
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,013
the following morning.

647
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:58,801
Good.

648
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:04,682
You okay?

649
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:13,156
I was gonna say, when

650
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:16,169
you didn't tell the team
about your connection to Kane,

651
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:18,195
I wasn't sure if that was a good idea.

652
00:53:20,656 --> 00:53:23,079
But after seeing that footage,

653
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:26,912
yeah“.

654
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:30,332
I'm not sure how they would
have reacted to you.

655
00:53:32,835 --> 00:53:35,258
Why did my husband volunteer
for a suicide mission?

656
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:37,673
Is that what you think we're doing?

657
00:53:38,257 --> 00:53:39,484
Committing suicide?

658
00:53:39,508 --> 00:53:42,352
You must have profiled him,
you must have assessed him.

659
00:53:43,262 --> 00:53:45,014
He must have said something.

660
00:53:46,265 --> 00:53:49,109
So you're asking me as a psychologist?

661
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:51,353
Yeah.

662
00:53:52,688 --> 00:53:54,782
Then as a psychologist,

663
00:53:55,441 --> 00:53:59,116
I'd say you're confusing
suicide with self-destruction.

664
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:04,124
Almost none of us commit suicide

665
00:54:04,533 --> 00:54:07,011
and almost all of us self-destruct.

666
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:10,209
In some way, in some part of our lives.

667
00:54:11,123 --> 00:54:14,102
We drink, or we smoke.

668
00:54:14,126 --> 00:54:16,345
We destabilize the good job

669
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:20,007
or the happy marriage.

670
00:54:25,137 --> 00:54:27,310
But these aren't decisions, they're...

671
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:29,617
They're impulses.

672
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:31,063
In fact,

673
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:33,163
you're probably better equipped

674
00:54:33,187 --> 00:54:35,485
to explain this than I am.
What does that mean?

675
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:38,400
You're a biologist.

676
00:54:39,318 --> 00:54:42,213
Isn't self-destruction coded into us?

677
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:43,739
Programed into each cell?

678
00:54:46,492 --> 00:54:47,835
What was that?

679
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,412
Don't know.

680
00:55:01,173 --> 00:55:02,233
Josie, wake up.

681
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:03,526
Wake up, Josie, come on. Wake up.

682
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:04,597
Something's happening.

683
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:06,762
Do you see anything?
No.

684
00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:08,938
What happened? I heard a noise.

685
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:11,642
Whoa.
What?

686
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:15,771
Something's come through the fence.

687
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:17,916
Through the fence?

688
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:19,613
It's ripped open like a fucking zipper.

689
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:27,457
I can't see anything.
Yeah, neither can I.

690
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:31,040
Sheppard!

691
00:55:31,662 --> 00:55:32,722
Sheppard!

692
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:34,474
Fuck.
What's going on?

693
00:55:34,498 --> 00:55:36,671
Sheppard was just next to me,
and something took her.

694
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:39,632
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!

695
00:55:39,795 --> 00:55:41,547
Sheppard!
Shit.

696
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:45,384
Help me!

697
00:55:46,385 --> 00:55:47,887
Help me!

698
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:54,810
Sheppard!

699
00:55:59,064 --> 00:56:00,316
Sheppard!

700
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:32,740
We have to go back.
We have to go back now.

701
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:33,992
She's right.

702
00:56:34,016 --> 00:56:35,785
Right? In what sense?

703
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:37,436
We've been attacked twice.

704
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:39,622
We lost one of our own.

705
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:41,499
We have evidence the previous team

706
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:42,750
went nuts and chopped each other up.

707
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:45,336
I really don't know
how much more right she has to be.

708
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,005
We haven't reached the lighthouse.

709
00:56:47,029 --> 00:56:48,423
We still don't understand the cause

710
00:56:48,447 --> 00:56:49,799
or the nature of the Shimmer.

711
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:51,467
We have data, observations, photographs.

712
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:52,594
She has hella footage.

713
00:56:52,618 --> 00:56:54,345
All of which makes the phenomenon

714
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:55,666
less explicable, not more.

715
00:56:58,707 --> 00:57:00,435
I'm gonna get to the lighthouse.

716
00:57:00,459 --> 00:57:02,395
And I'm fine going on my own.

717
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:04,387
You just need to decide

718
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:06,931
whether you're coming with me or not.

719
00:57:18,644 --> 00:57:21,205
It's like she doesn't even
notice that Sheppard is dead.

720
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:24,483
She's crazy. She's a crazy old bitch.

721
00:57:25,484 --> 00:57:27,111
And thanks for the fucking backup, Lena!

722
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:30,548
I didn't realize there were sides.

723
00:57:30,572 --> 00:57:31,633
Yeah.

724
00:57:31,657 --> 00:57:32,909
Yeah, there are sides.

725
00:57:34,034 --> 00:57:37,038
Okay. Then I agree with you,
we should go back.

726
00:57:37,663 --> 00:57:39,140
Good. Okay, great. There we go.

727
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:40,683
Okay, so the three of us

728
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:42,393
can just pack up our...
Hold on a minute.

729
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:43,686
Hold on. We should go back, yes.

730
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:46,314
But it took us, what,
six days to get here?

731
00:57:46,338 --> 00:57:49,091
And the coast is two days away.

732
00:57:49,675 --> 00:57:52,178
And as Sheppard said,

733
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:53,988
when we get to the coast,

734
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:56,561
we can just follow it until
we hit the perimeter wall.

735
00:57:56,932 --> 00:57:58,775
You're saying that we get out
by going deeper in?

736
00:57:59,226 --> 00:58:00,286
Yeah, if you like. Yeah.

737
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:01,607
"Like"?

738
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:04,523
No, I don't fucking "like."

739
00:58:08,694 --> 00:58:10,088
This isn't some bullshit tactic

740
00:58:10,112 --> 00:58:11,506
to get us to the lighthouse, is it?

741
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:14,204
This is not about the lighthouse, okay?

742
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:16,873
I believe that the coast
is the best route out.

743
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:22,499
Okay?

744
00:58:35,804 --> 00:58:37,397
You lied to them.

745
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:43,121
I didn't know what going back meant.

746
00:58:43,145 --> 00:58:45,898
Why it would be safer
than going forward.

747
00:58:46,815 --> 00:58:47,959
You didn't know,

748
00:58:47,983 --> 00:58:50,461
but you made the decision
to continue as if you did.

749
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:52,130
Ventress made the decision.

750
00:58:52,154 --> 00:58:55,499
Ventress had cancer,
she was never coming back.

751
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:57,914
You knew she was sick.

752
00:58:58,410 --> 00:58:59,753
I had guessed.

753
00:59:02,748 --> 00:59:04,591
And you wanted to continue?

754
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:07,760
Yes.

755
00:59:08,837 --> 00:59:10,009
I did.

756
00:59:56,968 --> 00:59:58,780
She could still be alive.

757
00:59:58,804 --> 01:00:00,272
It's highly doubtful.

758
01:00:01,807 --> 01:00:03,400
We need to know.

759
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:07,020
Go.

760
01:00:07,979 --> 01:00:08,980
Fine.

761
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:12,526
I'm coming with you.

762
01:00:13,819 --> 01:00:15,162
I'll go alone.

763
01:02:44,052 --> 01:02:45,304
Did you find her?

764
01:02:45,971 --> 01:02:46,972
Yeah.

765
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:49,649
She's dead.

766
01:03:13,999 --> 01:03:15,342
You okay?

767
01:03:16,084 --> 01:03:17,353
Fine.

768
01:03:17,377 --> 01:03:19,755
Just leave me the fuck alone.

769
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:47,453
We'll camp here tonight.

770
01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:51,203
It's another two hours' walk
up the coast.

771
01:04:28,823 --> 01:04:30,575
They've grown this way.

772
01:04:31,409 --> 01:04:33,082
That doesn't make any sense.

773
01:04:33,745 --> 01:04:35,247
I think it does.

774
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:45,816
At first, I thought the radio waves

775
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:47,735
were blocked by the Shimmer,

776
01:04:47,759 --> 01:04:49,945
and that's why no one inside
could communicate

777
01:04:49,969 --> 01:04:52,188
with base or GPS.

778
01:04:53,181 --> 01:04:55,201
But the light waves aren't blocked,

779
01:04:55,225 --> 01:04:57,694
they're refracted. And...

780
01:05:02,023 --> 01:05:04,117
It's the same with the radios.

781
01:05:04,776 --> 01:05:06,879
Signals aren't gone.

782
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:08,621
They're scrambled.

783
01:05:14,285 --> 01:05:16,128
That leaf in your hand.

784
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:19,007
Do you know what you'd get
if you sequenced it?

785
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:20,625
What?

786
01:05:21,084 --> 01:05:23,837
Human Hox genes.
"Hox"? What does "Hox" mean?

787
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:26,524
They're the genes
that define the body plan,

788
01:05:26,548 --> 01:05:28,095
the physical structure.

789
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:33,155
And the plants have human body plan.

790
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:37,535
Arms attached to shoulders,
legs to hips.

791
01:05:37,559 --> 01:05:39,186
It's literally not possible.

792
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:41,396
It's literally what's happening.

793
01:05:43,731 --> 01:05:45,709
The Shimmer is a prism,

794
01:05:45,733 --> 01:05:47,485
but it refracts everything.

795
01:05:48,153 --> 01:05:50,702
Not just light and radio waves.

796
01:05:51,322 --> 01:05:54,326
Animal DNA. Plant DNA.

797
01:05:55,535 --> 01:05:56,878
All DNA.

798
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:58,793
What do you mean, all DNA?

799
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:01,670
She's talking about our DNA.

800
01:06:04,085 --> 01:06:05,758
She's talking about us.

801
01:07:12,403 --> 01:07:14,997
All right. I guess this is the bedroom.

802
01:07:16,407 --> 01:07:18,580
Let's secure doors and windows.

803
01:08:43,995 --> 01:08:45,668
This was a mistake.

804
01:08:48,166 --> 01:08:49,509
Okay.

805
01:08:55,506 --> 01:08:58,385
You spend more time away from
your husband than with him.

806
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:01,947
You can't talk to him about work,

807
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:02,972
and he won't talk to you about his.

808
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:05,367
And there is a clear physical

809
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:07,411
and intellectual connection between us.

810
01:09:07,435 --> 01:09:08,704
Have I covered the bases?

811
01:09:08,728 --> 01:09:09,955
You forgot to mention your wife.

812
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:11,697
I love my wife.

813
01:09:13,941 --> 01:09:15,784
She's blameless in this.

814
01:09:24,035 --> 01:09:25,378
Come on, Lena.

815
01:09:26,496 --> 01:09:28,419
What's really going on here?

816
01:09:30,375 --> 01:09:33,049
You think that something
may have happened to him?

817
01:09:37,715 --> 01:09:39,717
Or you think he knows.

818
01:09:41,886 --> 01:09:43,479
That's it, isn't it?

819
01:09:43,888 --> 01:09:47,233
You think somehow
he's found out about our affair.

820
01:09:48,726 --> 01:09:50,399
Has he found out?

821
01:09:51,062 --> 01:09:52,314
Yes.

822
01:09:55,733 --> 01:09:57,076
You should go.

823
01:09:59,070 --> 01:10:01,072
No, Lena, I...
Dan.

824
01:10:01,572 --> 01:10:03,967
I'm not interested in talking,

825
01:10:03,991 --> 01:10:05,914
or anything you have to say.

826
01:10:06,744 --> 01:10:08,746
Just get dressed and get out.

827
01:10:11,165 --> 01:10:12,685
You know, it's not me you hate.

828
01:10:12,709 --> 01:10:14,086
It's yourself.

829
01:10:17,255 --> 01:10:19,098
No, Dan, it's you, too.

830
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:24,933
It's never gonna happen again.

831
01:10:30,601 --> 01:10:31,727
You lying bitch!

832
01:10:33,354 --> 01:10:35,833
What's going on?
No.

833
01:10:35,857 --> 01:10:37,793
You don't get to ask
that fucking question.

834
01:10:37,817 --> 01:10:39,819
You answer it!

835
01:11:08,431 --> 01:11:10,058
Brother.

836
01:11:11,684 --> 01:11:13,732
Boyfriend.

837
01:11:14,604 --> 01:11:16,197
Husband.

838
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:20,947
Husband.

839
01:11:22,862 --> 01:11:24,660
Why didn't you tell us?

840
01:11:26,991 --> 01:11:28,038
You knew.

841
01:11:29,202 --> 01:11:30,624
Obviously.

842
01:11:34,248 --> 01:11:35,340
Did you know?

843
01:11:40,421 --> 01:11:41,718
Okay.

844
01:11:45,593 --> 01:11:46,904
So, there are two theories

845
01:11:46,928 --> 01:11:48,113
of what went wrong in the Shimmer.

846
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:50,731
One is that something in here
killed them. Two

847
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:53,901
is that they went crazy
and they killed each other.

848
01:11:55,478 --> 01:11:57,664
Josie nearly got killed by an alligator,

849
01:11:57,688 --> 01:12:00,441
and Cass did get killed
by a bear.

850
01:12:02,777 --> 01:12:05,030
So, yes, theory one, it fits.

851
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:09,333
But

852
01:12:11,911 --> 01:12:13,913
I didn't actually see a bear.

853
01:12:14,872 --> 01:12:17,476
And neither did Josie.

854
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:19,753
The only people who saw a bear
were Lena and Ventress.

855
01:12:20,086 --> 01:12:23,010
So nothing's confirmed.
Everything's on their word.

856
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:27,778
Everything's on Lena's word.

857
01:12:27,802 --> 01:12:29,770
And what we know now...

858
01:12:30,847 --> 01:12:37,579
What we know is that Lena is a liar.

859
01:12:37,603 --> 01:12:40,482
Shut the fuck up!

860
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:44,990
Lena, you're a liar.

861
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:48,906
Did you kill Cass?

862
01:12:51,701 --> 01:12:53,578
Did you lose your shit?

863
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:57,766
Or do you think that I've lost my shit,

864
01:12:57,790 --> 01:12:59,309
and now we're just gonna
fuck each other up?

865
01:12:59,333 --> 01:13:00,880
That's theory two.

866
01:13:03,754 --> 01:13:05,222
Oh!

867
01:13:12,179 --> 01:13:14,181
When I look at my hands

868
01:13:15,016 --> 01:13:16,859
and my fingerprints,

869
01:13:17,852 --> 01:13:19,445
I can see them moving.

870
01:13:26,694 --> 01:13:28,755
If I let you go

871
01:13:28,779 --> 01:13:31,703
and you tie me to a chair
and cut me open,

872
01:13:33,117 --> 01:13:36,838
are my insides gonna move
like my fingerprints?

873
01:13:44,211 --> 01:13:48,091
But I'm not the one tied to a chair.

874
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:53,475
You are.

875
01:13:58,142 --> 01:14:00,144
Help me!

876
01:14:02,897 --> 01:14:04,615
Help me!

877
01:14:04,732 --> 01:14:06,585
Help me!

878
01:14:06,609 --> 01:14:08,282
Oh, Cass?

879
01:14:10,613 --> 01:14:11,956
You said she was dead.

880
01:14:13,741 --> 01:14:16,335
Cass! Cass, I'm coming!

881
01:14:18,245 --> 01:14:20,247
Cass, is that you?

882
01:15:03,582 --> 01:15:04,674
Help me!

883
01:15:06,377 --> 01:15:08,550
Help me!

884
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:11,633
Help...

885
01:15:26,313 --> 01:15:27,530
Don't react.

886
01:15:34,989 --> 01:15:37,492
me!

887
01:16:04,351 --> 01:16:06,604
Help...

888
01:16:20,701 --> 01:16:22,044
me!

889
01:17:13,254 --> 01:17:14,255
Help me.

890
01:17:39,071 --> 01:17:40,744
What are you doing?

891
01:17:40,990 --> 01:17:43,664
I'm leaving.
Now?

892
01:17:45,327 --> 01:17:47,921
It's not even light yet.
I don't have time to wait.

893
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:50,016
We are disintegrating!

894
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:52,338
Our bodies
as fast as our minds. Can't you feel it?

895
01:17:53,836 --> 01:17:55,930
It's like the onset of dementia.

896
01:17:58,924 --> 01:18:00,676
If I don't reach the lighthouse soon,

897
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:02,821
the person that started this journey

898
01:18:02,845 --> 01:18:05,073
won't be the person that ends it.

899
01:18:05,097 --> 01:18:07,020
I want to be the one that ends it.

900
01:19:09,245 --> 01:19:11,418
We should go, Josie.

901
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:22,099
How long was your husband
in the Shimmer?

902
01:19:22,925 --> 01:19:25,098
It's hard to say, exactly.

903
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:30,058
Theoretically, as long as a year.

904
01:19:32,434 --> 01:19:35,859
That's a long time to be
inside and remain intact.

905
01:19:36,522 --> 01:19:39,071
I'm not so sure he was intact.

906
01:19:42,695 --> 01:19:44,368
I'm right

907
01:19:45,114 --> 01:19:48,343
about the refractions, aren't I?

908
01:19:48,367 --> 01:19:49,678
Yeah.

909
01:19:49,702 --> 01:19:51,704
I checked my blood last night.

910
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:56,462
It's in me.

911
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:01,930
It will be in all of us.

912
01:20:07,886 --> 01:20:11,491
It was so strange
hearing Sheppard's voice

913
01:20:11,515 --> 01:20:13,984
in the mouth of that creature
last night.

914
01:20:15,144 --> 01:20:18,569
I think, as she was dying,
part of her mind became

915
01:20:19,064 --> 01:20:21,908
part of the creature
that was killing her.

916
01:20:23,402 --> 01:20:26,256
Imagine dying frightened and in pain

917
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:30,160
and having that as the only
part of you which survives.

918
01:20:30,909 --> 01:20:32,911
I wouldn't like that at all.

919
01:20:53,349 --> 01:20:55,443
Ventress wants to face it.

920
01:20:55,768 --> 01:20:57,611
You want to fight it.

921
01:20:59,021 --> 01:21:02,116
But I don't think I want
either of those things.

922
01:21:09,156 --> 01:21:10,282
Josie?

923
01:21:17,915 --> 01:21:18,962
Josie.

924
01:21:23,462 --> 01:21:24,805
Josie.

925
01:21:50,823 --> 01:21:54,999
One by one, all gone, except you.

926
01:21:56,995 --> 01:21:58,918
How do you explain that?

927
01:22:02,418 --> 01:22:04,841
Is it something I need to explain?

928
01:22:05,337 --> 01:22:07,089
Yes, you do.

929
01:22:13,262 --> 01:22:14,935
I had to come back.

930
01:22:16,515 --> 01:22:18,688
I'm not sure any of them did.

931
01:22:35,325 --> 01:22:36,827
Hey.

932
01:22:40,581 --> 01:22:42,709
Hey.

933
01:27:34,124 --> 01:27:36,047
I thought I was a man.

934
01:27:43,467 --> 01:27:45,140
I had a life.

935
01:27:46,803 --> 01:27:48,646
People called me Kane.

936
01:27:50,807 --> 01:27:52,809
And now I'm not so sure.

937
01:27:57,314 --> 01:27:59,658
If I wasn't Kane, what was I?

938
01:28:05,572 --> 01:28:07,074
Was I you?

939
01:28:10,410 --> 01:28:11,912
Were you me?

940
01:28:23,465 --> 01:28:27,766
My flesh moves like liquid.

941
01:28:31,181 --> 01:28:32,774
My mind is

942
01:28:34,684 --> 01:28:36,186
just cut loose.

943
01:28:36,686 --> 01:28:38,108
I can't bear it.

944
01:28:40,607 --> 01:28:42,585
<i>I can't bear it.</i>

945
01:28:42,609 --> 01:28:44,111
<i>I can't bear it.</i>

946
01:28:49,199 --> 01:28:51,543
You ever seen
a phosphorus grenade go off?

947
01:28:53,119 --> 01:28:54,371
They're kinda bright.

948
01:28:56,331 --> 01:28:57,753
<i>Shield your eyes.</i>

949
01:28:59,543 --> 01:29:02,217
If you ever get out of here,
you find Lena.

950
01:29:03,129 --> 01:29:04,756
I will.

951
01:29:05,090 --> 01:29:06,216
No.

952
01:29:09,135 --> 01:29:13,811
Five, four, three, two...

953
01:31:07,879 --> 01:31:10,302
It's the last phase.

954
01:31:11,758 --> 01:31:14,181
Vanished into havoc.

955
01:31:17,222 --> 01:31:20,567
Unfathomable mind.

956
01:31:23,853 --> 01:31:26,707
And now beacon.

957
01:31:26,731 --> 01:31:28,404
Now sea.

958
01:31:32,404 --> 01:31:34,077
Dr. Ventress?

959
01:31:39,077 --> 01:31:40,169
Lena?

960
01:31:47,752 --> 01:31:49,254
We spoke.

961
01:31:50,630 --> 01:31:52,303
What was it we said?

962
01:31:58,013 --> 01:32:00,408
That I needed to know

963
01:32:00,432 --> 01:32:02,935
what was inside the lighthouse.

964
01:32:05,395 --> 01:32:06,817
That moment's passed.

965
01:32:10,692 --> 01:32:12,865
It's inside me now.

966
01:32:13,820 --> 01:32:16,414
What's inside you?

967
01:32:16,906 --> 01:32:18,783
It's not like us.

968
01:32:19,492 --> 01:32:21,790
It's unlike us.

969
01:32:24,622 --> 01:32:26,624
I don't know what it wants.

970
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,422
Or if it wants.

971
01:32:29,377 --> 01:32:31,355
But it will grow

972
01:32:31,379 --> 01:32:34,098
until it encompasses everything.

973
01:32:36,342 --> 01:32:38,654
Our bodies and our minds
will be fragmented

974
01:32:38,678 --> 01:32:40,197
into their smallest parts

975
01:32:40,221 --> 01:32:44,226
until not one part remains.

976
01:32:48,313 --> 01:32:49,986
Annihilation.

977
01:44:08,784 --> 01:44:10,786
So it was alien.

978
01:44:17,209 --> 01:44:19,211
Can you describe its form?

979
01:44:23,632 --> 01:44:24,849
No.

980
01:44:25,468 --> 01:44:28,017
Was it carbon-based or...

981
01:44:31,182 --> 01:44:32,684
I don't know.

982
01:44:34,852 --> 01:44:36,320
What did it want?

983
01:44:37,897 --> 01:44:40,375
I don't think it wanted anything.

984
01:44:40,399 --> 01:44:43,073
But it... It attacked you.

985
01:44:43,903 --> 01:44:45,746
It mirrored me.

986
01:44:46,155 --> 01:44:47,828
I attacked it.

987
01:44:48,741 --> 01:44:51,052
I'm not sure it even knew I was there.

988
01:44:51,076 --> 01:44:53,249
It came here for a reason.

989
01:44:54,079 --> 01:44:55,932
It was mutating our environment.

990
01:44:55,956 --> 01:44:57,924
It was destroying everything.

991
01:44:59,084 --> 01:45:01,257
It wasn't destroying.

992
01:45:02,588 --> 01:45:04,841
It was changing everything.

993
01:45:05,341 --> 01:45:08,311
It was making something new.

994
01:45:10,596 --> 01:45:12,018
Making what?

995
01:45:19,772 --> 01:45:21,240
I don't know.

996
01:45:25,277 --> 01:45:28,372
A team reached the lighthouse
a few hours ago.

997
01:45:29,198 --> 01:45:30,825
Everything is ash.

998
01:45:31,450 --> 01:45:34,954
If what you encountered was once alive,

999
01:45:35,371 --> 01:45:37,214
it seems it's now dead.

1000
01:45:58,644 --> 01:46:02,524
Now will you tell me
what happened to my husband?

1001
01:46:03,065 --> 01:46:04,793
<i>When the Shimmer disappeared,</i>

1002
01:46:04,817 --> 01:46:06,711
<i>his blood pressure stabilized</i>

1003
01:46:06,735 --> 01:46:09,238
<i>and his pulse rate started to rise.</i>

1004
01:46:10,322 --> 01:46:12,342
<i>A few hours later,
he was not only awake,</i>

1005
01:46:12,366 --> 01:46:13,993
<i>he was lucid.</i>

1006
01:46:15,327 --> 01:46:17,921
<i>He's still in isolation, obviously.</i>

1007
01:46:18,914 --> 01:46:20,257
So am I.

1008
01:47:04,251 --> 01:47:05,753
You aren't Kane.

1009
01:47:07,171 --> 01:47:08,889
Are you?

1010
01:47:14,762 --> 01:47:16,935
I don't think so.

1011
01:47:24,355 --> 01:47:26,073
Are you Lena?
