In the weeks
leading to her migration,

she eats almost
continuously.

7

To survive the journey,
she must double
her body weight.

8

on the other hand,
must lose weight

Americans celebrated
Christmas Day

48

with contests to kill
the most birds
in a single day.

ornithologist Frank Chapman

suggested Americans should
count them instead,

to the creation

to see that black-footed
albatross?

I sure did. Thanks.

He psyched me out.
Made me seasick.

I'm doing a Big Year.

00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:18,136
You're not a golf widow.
You can't compare golf
to this.

512
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,637
Golf's just like a hobby.

513
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,931
And the birding
is what exactly?

514
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:26,477
I don't know,
it's like a calling.
This is like my calling.

515
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:27,812
Like Gandhi?

516
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:32,525
No, come on.
I'm not comparing
myself to Gandhi, okay?

517
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:37,488
That's ridiculous.
Okay? It's more like
I'm Mozart, I guess.

518
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:42,994
Okay, fine.
You got a calling.
I got a calling, too.

519
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,620
It's known as a baby.
Yeah.

520
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:48,666
I know. I like to think
that that's like another
one of my callings, too.

521
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,711
And you're gonna
have to contribute,
you realize, eventually.

522
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,045
I realize.
In person.

523
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:57,091
Yes. In person.
I wouldn't want it
any other way.

524
00:27:57,176 --> 00:28:00,219
Really? 'Cause I ain't
so sure, Wolfgang.

525
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:03,055
Maybe I can
convince you.

526
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:08,477
I didn't mean now.

527
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:10,813
Come on. What's
the matter with now?

528
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:13,024
'Cause we have a house
full of men.

529
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,609
Just pretend
they're not there.

530
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:15,776
(LOUD WHIRRING)

531
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:19,989
Okay, pretend that
we don't care that
they're there.

532
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:21,616
I'm pretending.

533
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,367
WEATHERMAN ON TV:
...throughout much
of the Southwest,

534
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:25,703
spreading all the way
into the Pacific Northwest.

535
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,705
Now, for those of you
in the Southeast,

536
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:30,291
Texas will be experiencing
high winds this morning,

537
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,877
as this storm moves
very quickly south

538
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,420
into the Gulf of Mexico.

539
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:37,548
If you're planning to be
anywhere in the Gulf today,

540
00:28:37,633 --> 00:28:39,217
better batten down
the hatches.

541
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:42,220
We are talking about a storm
that may last for 72 hours.

542
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:43,888
Look at these waves,
these winds,

543
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,640
and strong storms.
Fallout.

544
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,768
We are talking
hurricane-force winds.
Kenny.

545
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:54,106
I know this is bad.
I know this makes me look
like a world-class asshole,

546
00:28:54,191 --> 00:28:55,441
but, babe, I gotta go.

547
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:57,985
Kenny! Kenny!

548
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:03,783
Kenny!

549
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:05,451
I'll call you!

550
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:18,839
Bill? Don't say no.
I'm going to Texas.

551
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:20,091
I'm getting on a plane
right now.

552
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:21,801
Texas? You just got back.

553
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:25,137
Bill! There is going to be
major fallout in a few hours.

554
00:29:25,222 --> 00:29:26,264
Nuclear fallout?

555
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:27,765
Bird fallout.

556
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:29,684
What are you
talking about?

557
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,103
I'm talking
about a major storm
hitting the Gulf of Mexico

558
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:33,437
in the middle of
migration season.

559
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:34,855
I'm talking about
headwinds and downpours

560
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,692
and a hundred thousand birds
literally dropping from
the sky!

561
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:40,903
I'll put it down
as a sick day.

562
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:43,364
Stu.
Hey.

563
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:44,949
Where you going?
Texas.

564
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:48,744
Texas? Now?
What about Mclntire?
How do we explain this?

565
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:50,913
Act of God.

566
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:54,875
Act of God?
No! That's not gonna work!
Stop this car! Stop this car!

567
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:57,253
Those damn birds!

568
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,300
NARRATOR: Sixteen hours
have brought Ruby
within 20 miles of shore.

569
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:06,095
But the tailwind
that carried her
all this way

570
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:09,765
is suddenly a headwind
blowing from the north.

571
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:13,978
Now she must
work twice as hard
to go half as far.

572
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:18,566
The storm has knocked her
from a migrating
altitude of 1,000 feet

573
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,277
to a mere six feet.

574
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:25,072
She can't swim.
One dip, and she's gone.

575
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:30,286
The programmer arrives
on the outskirts of Houston,

576
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:33,414
feeling for once that
luck is on his side.

577
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,291
I'm starting to think
I have a chance.

578
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:40,671
The roving CEO is also
buoyant after escaping
his obligations in New York.

579
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,965
I really believe
I can win this thing.

580
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:46,802
The reigning king,
not surprisingly,
is extremely confident.

581
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:50,264
Yes! Yes!
I really think I've
got this thing locked up.

582
00:30:50,724 --> 00:30:52,558
All three have
done the math.

583
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:55,644
They know what
spring fallout means.

584
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:58,814
A world record is
within their grasp.

585
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,527
(CLAMORING)

586
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:11,452
Whoa!

587
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:15,289
Unbelievable.

588
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,044
Oh, my God.

589
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:32,473
REPORTER:
Faced with that headwind,

590
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,558
they have to come down
at the first land they see,

591
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:36,894
and that's right here.

592
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:38,229
One thing's for sure,

593
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:42,274
today's happening
is strictly for
the birds. Gretchen.

594
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,485
Come on, guys, get...
Keep it moving!

595
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,320
Come on, we got
a lot of birds to see.

596
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:50,407
Bloody ass. Only Americans
can turn birding into
a competition!

597
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:53,119
That's right.
You don't want
to miss this one!

598
00:31:53,203 --> 00:31:54,328
What?

599
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,093
Brad!
Stu!

600
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,636
I knew you'd be here.
I was looking for you.

601
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,805
Me, too.
This is incredible, isn't it?

602
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:14,515
I know.
Where do we even start?

603
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:21,480
There's the best
birder in the world.
Maybe we should...

604
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:23,482
Follow him.

605
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:25,442
(LET IT SHINE PLAYING)

606
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:31,031
(INAUDIBLE)

STU:
Prothonotary warbler.

608
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:40,207
(EXCLAIMING EXCITEDLY)

609
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:45,796
Gotcha.

610
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,509
Oh! Blue grosbeak.

611
00:32:50,594 --> 00:32:51,844
It's a buffet.

612
00:32:52,012 --> 00:32:54,263
(SINGING) So I play what
the kids wanna hear

613
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:56,265
While I spange on Broadway

614
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:58,809
Shine, let it shine

615
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:01,979
Even if it burns your eyes

616
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:04,273
This light of mine is mine

617
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:06,734
And I'm gonna
let it shine...

618
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:08,944
Ever get the feeling
you're being followed?

619
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:10,654
Hello, master.

620
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:11,739
How you doing, Stu?

621
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,824
Still filling
those weekends, I see.

622
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:15,910
Unless you and your son here
are doing a Big Year.

623
00:33:16,203 --> 00:33:21,373
(CHUCKLES) Oh!
Kenny Bostick, this is
my friend Brad Harris.

624
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:23,000
Who's also not doing
a Big Year.

625
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:25,753
That's funny how
nobody's doing a Big Year.

626
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:28,088
Yeah. With all this
fallout and El Niño.

627
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:31,300
Yeah, I know, you'd think
the conditions are just
set up perfect

628
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:33,469
for someone
to have a real shot
at breaking my record.

629
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:35,804
Not that record.
Pink-footed goose!

630
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:38,015
Pink-footed goose,
other end of the boardwalk.

631
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:40,559
What the hell's
that doing here?

632
00:33:40,644 --> 00:33:41,685
MAN: Be careful!

633
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:48,901
Hey, put her down!

634
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:52,613
Hey, hey, please,
let the explorers through!

635
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,033
Of course.
Let's go, ladies. Jeesh.

636
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:57,326
After you, kids.

637
00:33:57,619 --> 00:33:58,827
Get those badges.

638
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,163
Chop, chop, chop, chop!
Step it up! Stepping lively!

639
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,041
Move it along!

640
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:05,292
Thank you.

641
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:16,637
She took off. Headed north.
Probably be in Iceland
by Friday.

642
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,764
Boy, she was a beaut, too!

643
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:21,517
Hey, is that a Calliope?

644
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:26,063
Just another
ruby-throated.

645
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:28,148
On everybody's list
by March.

646
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,985
Sorry to disappoint
you boys again.

647
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:38,701
NARRATOR: Notjust
another ruby-throated,
but our ruby.

648
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:44,206
Drenched and diminished,
frail and trembling,
but alive.

649
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:47,543
Alive! Alive!

650
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:56,510
Good evening.
Tonight's special is quail.
I highly recommend it.

651
00:34:58,638 --> 00:34:59,638
I couldn't.

652
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:00,806
Yeah, not tonight.

653
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,017
I'll have the halibut.

654
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,144
And a bottle of
this Montrachet.

655
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:06,311
Of course.

656
00:35:06,396 --> 00:35:09,523
And I will have the soup.
Thank you.

657
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:15,279
Really? After being
outside all day
in the wind and rain?

658
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:17,364
Kind of a light eater.

659
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:19,700
And the truth is

660
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:22,703
the prices here
are a little steeper
than I'm used to.

661
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:26,623
Brad, I invited you
to dinner.
I know, but...

662
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:28,625
No, it's my pleasure.

663
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:32,337
Look, when I'm birding,
I don't fly first class
or hire guides.

664
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:35,549
It's too much like
corked bats
and steroids to me.

665
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:39,553
But tonight
we're celebrating.

666
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:43,348
We saw 136 species!

667
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:45,851
Brad, 136!

668
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:47,019
Here's to them.

669
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:48,604
And to the one
who got away.

670
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:49,813
Pink-footed goose.

671
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:53,275
The Montrachet.

672
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:57,154
Good. And my friend
would like to see
the menu again, please.

673
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:58,739
WAITER: Of course.

674
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:00,908
Cool.

675
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:04,912
That shrimp scampi
was calling my name,
if you must know.

676
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,830
That's a little too much.
Okay.

677
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:10,501
NARRATOR: In the afterglow
of their extraordinary day,

678
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:15,214
the programmer
and the roving CEO
forge a warm friendship

679
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:18,217
deeply rooted in
their shared passion.

680
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:21,095
I mean, I'm 36.

681
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:22,971
I'm divorced.

682
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:25,390
I have a job I hate.

683
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:29,103
I just want to do
something big, you know?
Make my mark.

684
00:36:29,479 --> 00:36:30,729
So what are you gonna do?

685
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:34,691
I'm working on something.
(EXCLAIMS DISMISSIVELY)

686
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:37,486
My dad doesn't get it.

687
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:40,239
He's had the same
boring job for 40 years.

688
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:43,492
"That's what people do,"
he says.

689
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,285
He's right.

690
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:49,206
Most people just stay
on the beaten path,
then one day,

691
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,959
they wake up and realize
they didn't do everything
they wanted to do.

692
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,962
Look at me.
I was so afraid to retire,

693
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,131
I had to do it twice
before I finally
got out here.

694
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:58,590
Why'd you wait so long?

695
00:36:58,675 --> 00:37:00,592
'Cause I'm an idiot.

696
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,512
Okay, I gotta tell you.

697
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,223
I'm doing a Big Year.

698
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:12,020
Wow.

699
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,730
I know.

700
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:17,234
NARRATOR:
The retired CEO
faces a dilemma.

701
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:20,779
He feels true kinship
with the programmer.

702
00:37:20,864 --> 00:37:23,490
Should he divulge
his own Big Year?

703
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:25,826
Don't tell anybody, okay?

704
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:30,914
But with the exception of
certain pernicious bacteria,

705
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:35,878
Homo sapiens is the most
competitive species on Earth.

706
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:38,172
Mum's the word.

707
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:40,090
We won't have
to eat for a week.

708
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:41,258
I'm hurting.

709
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:43,969
Great dinner.

710
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:50,184
Good luck.

711
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:51,768
Thanks again.

712
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,521
Hey, it's me,

713
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:56,356
Mozart.

714
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,984
The fallout's over
and now I'm calling

715
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:01,195
to deal with the fallout
from the fallout.

716
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:05,032
Look, babe, I'm sorry.
I'm gonna make it up
to you, you'll see.

717
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:06,658
I'm going to...

718
00:38:06,743 --> 00:38:08,368
Where are you, anyway?
It's late there.

719
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:10,078
I hope
you're okay, babe.
Oh! Where am I?

720
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:14,666
I'm shooting hormones
into my butt so I can
have your baby, Kenny.

721
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:17,502
Okay, I'm going to
hit the sack here,

722
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:19,129
but I will try you
in the morning,

723
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:20,714
and I'm gonna be
launching a new thing

724
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,674
called Operation
Sweep Her Off Her Feet.

725
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:24,676
So, you might
want to get ready,

726
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:26,553
'cause it's gonna be
pretty spectacular.

727
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:29,973
Okay? All right.
Talk to you tomorrow.

728
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:37,898
Pomarine jaeger,
nine o'clock!

729
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,035
Brad.

730
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:52,996
Brad!
No.

731
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:54,539
Oh! Sorry.
Sorry.

I still feel like a heel.
Feel like I led him on.

But I'm afraid
if he knew
about my Big Year,

740
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:44,298
Bostick'd get it
out of him eventually.

741
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:47,509
And why is it so important
to keep this secret
from Bostick?

742
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:49,011
Less competition
he thinks he has,

743
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:52,681
the more he's likely
to throttle back,
not try so hard.

744
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,891
Not grind for
the extra birds.

745
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:56,643
Maybe I could
sneak past him.

746
00:39:56,978 --> 00:40:00,105
Do whatever it takes
to set that record, honey.

747
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:02,566
You know how much
it means to me.

748

I miss you, doll.

What are you doing
this weekend?

750
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:09,614
I could get us a room
in Saint Paul, not far
from the Sax Zim Bog.

00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:12,409
Really!
Not far from the bog.

Hey, Jim.

761
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:32,179
Yeah, listen,
talks broke down.

Deal was dead
by 10:00. Over.

763
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,933
Total acrimony.
On the way out the door,

764
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:40,687
we agreed to
a do-or-die session,
May 14th,

765
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:42,439
here in New York
in our office.

766
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:43,982
I can't. Impossible.

767
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:45,734
I'm flying to Attu
on the 14th.

768

To where?

769
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:49,237
Attu, Alaska.
And I can't miss
the flight.

770
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:50,697
There's not another one
for a week.

771
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:52,783
Stu, you're not involved,
the deal dies.

772
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,201
Look, you gave
these people
their jobs.

773
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:55,869
If you don't do something,
they're gonna lose them!

774
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:58,997
And that means a hell
of a lot more than
some birds on Attu.

NARRATOR: Attu.
The westernmost island
of the Aleutian chain.

776
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:10,092
So far west,
it's closer to Tokyo
than to Anchorage.

777
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,594
There are no hotels,
no phones,

778
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:15,430
no restaurants
or permanent residents.

779
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:19,726
But for birders,
Attu is paradise.

780
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:25,732
Nobody could hope to win
a Big Year without going
to Attu in May.

Stop packing.
I'm serious! Mom!

786
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:42,666
Are you upset because
you think you can't win,

787
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,000
or because
he lied to you?

788
00:41:44,085 --> 00:41:46,253
Both.
And what about Bostick?

789
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:47,504
Who?

790
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:49,339
Kenny Bostick,
the best birder
in the world.

791
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:51,842
I think he might be
doing another Big Year.

792
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:53,135
What chance do I have?

793
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:57,597
Oh, Brad,
you have 486 birds.
You're on a record pace.

794
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:00,058
You can't quit now!

00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:03,019
Mom, my credit card
is maxed out.
No. No. No. No.

796
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:06,273
Even if I go to Alaska,
there's no way I can
complete the year!

797
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:08,608
This has a $6,000 limit.

798
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:10,902
Bring me back
some Alaska pictures.

799
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:12,571
No, Mom, I can't.
No, no, no, no.

800
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:14,781
Get dressed.
Your plane leaves
in an hour.

801
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:16,908
Don't piss off
your travel agent.

802
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:21,204
I had no idea
this car could
go this fast.

803
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:22,873
If you miss this plane,

804
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:24,291
there's not
another one
for a week.

805
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,293
So, we gotta do it.

806
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:29,004
Mom, Mom, Mom!

807
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:40,098
Welcome back,
Mr. Preissler!
Thank you.

808
00:42:40,183 --> 00:42:41,558
Thanks for
being here, Stu.

STU: I can give you
four hours, that's it.

810

my flight to Alaska.

BARRY: No problem.
JIM: How was your trip?

812
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:48,648
Louisiana was spectacular.

813
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:50,108
Lot of birds
in the bayou.

814
00:42:50,193 --> 00:42:53,528
And saw a loggerhead shrike
from my hotel room
in Natchitoches.

815
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:54,779
Adorable!

816
00:42:54,864 --> 00:42:57,032
It imitates the songs
of other birds
to lure them in close.

817
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:58,074
Uh-huh.

818
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:00,577
Then it impales them
on thorns, breaks their
necks and eats them.

819
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:01,995
Yeesh!

820
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,581
STU: We'll assume the cost
of retrofitting the plants,

821
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:06,291
but that still leaves
the non-compete clause.

822
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:07,709
Barry says you have
an issue with it.

823
00:43:07,877 --> 00:43:10,921
No. It's not a big issue,
but I'm not like you, Stu.

824
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:14,633
I'm not ready to hang it all
up so I can spend the rest
of my life bird watching.

00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:16,218
(MEN LAUGHING)

826
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:20,972
It's called
"birding," Rick.

827
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:23,099
And there's no
wiggle room here.

828
00:43:23,184 --> 00:43:25,268
This is a deal-breaker
for us.

829
00:43:26,479 --> 00:43:27,938
Wait, what?
Wait, wait, wait.

830
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:31,775
Four hours ago,
you said that everything
was negotiable.

831
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:34,653
What, was this just
so you could lure me
in to finish me off?

832
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:41,117
The shrike.

833
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:43,787
It's 11: 15.

for the airport
15 minutes ago.

835
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:50,919
All right. Stu! Just wait,
one second, please.
One second.

836

01:35:20,882 --> 01:35:22,340
I know,
it's not quite human.

1693
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:25,093
But you are second!
How amazing is that?

1694
01:35:25,178 --> 01:35:27,470
A full-time job
and you're second?

1695
01:35:29,098 --> 01:35:30,974
And? You're third?

1696
01:35:31,434 --> 01:35:32,976
Fourth. What can I say?

1697
01:35:33,644 --> 01:35:35,061
I waited
too long to do it.

1698
01:35:35,146 --> 01:35:36,438
No, you didn't.
Don't say that.

1699
01:35:36,522 --> 01:35:38,815
Then you would have done it
some other year.

1700
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:41,651
And really, we won.

1701
01:35:42,153 --> 01:35:43,153
What do you mean?

1702
01:35:43,571 --> 01:35:45,864
We won, Stu!
I don't know
how else to put it.

1703
01:35:46,490 --> 01:35:48,575
I don't just mean
I wouldn't have come
in second without you.

1704
01:35:48,659 --> 01:35:49,951
Although that's true.

1705
01:35:50,036 --> 01:35:56,041
I mean, I don't know,
he got more birds,
but we got more everything.

1706
01:35:57,376 --> 01:35:58,418
Do you know
what I mean?

1707
01:36:02,173 --> 01:36:03,173
Yeah, I do.

1708
01:36:04,217 --> 01:36:07,260
Thank you, Stu.
Have I said thank you?

1709
01:36:07,595 --> 01:36:09,054
Hey, for what?

1710
01:36:10,097 --> 01:36:11,806
Congrats.
Take care, buddy.

1711
01:36:14,852 --> 01:36:15,852
Yep.

1712
01:36:16,729 --> 01:36:18,647
Looks like you'll be
spending the weekend

1713
01:36:18,731 --> 01:36:20,857
with the second best
birder in the world.

1714
01:36:22,276 --> 01:36:24,110
(SQUEALING EXCITEDLY)

1715
01:36:35,414 --> 01:36:36,539
Bostick!

1716
01:36:36,999 --> 01:36:38,541
(SNICKERING)

1717
01:36:38,876 --> 01:36:42,337
NARRATOR: Eight weeks later,
the ruby-throated hummingbird

1718
01:36:42,421 --> 01:36:45,465
begins her migration
all over again.

1719
01:36:46,217 --> 01:36:49,594
She hopes
it will be uneventful.

1720
01:36:51,806 --> 01:36:53,223
High in the Rockies,

1721
01:36:53,307 --> 01:36:57,394
the retired CEO
goes birding with
the future CEO,

1722
01:36:57,478 --> 01:37:00,438
who happily does not
yet know how to count.

1723
01:37:00,856 --> 01:37:02,274
That's a male goldfinch.

1724
01:37:02,358 --> 01:37:05,068
In a couple of months,
it's gonna turn all yellow.

1725
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:11,074
To celebrate his victory,
the reigning king goes
to China.

1726
01:37:13,244 --> 01:37:14,703
(INAUDIBLE)

1727
01:37:17,248 --> 01:37:20,959
Only he knows the price
that he has paid

1728
01:37:21,043 --> 01:37:24,212
to be the greatest birder
in the world.

1729
01:37:27,425 --> 01:37:31,594
The North American
programmer travels
to the coast of Maine.

1730
01:37:32,430 --> 01:37:38,685
Though still an avid birder,
he at last has an even
greater passion.

1731
01:37:44,275 --> 01:37:48,028
(THIS COULD ALL BE YOURS
PLAYING)

1732
01:37:55,828 --> 01:37:59,789
There's a message
in the skies
and in the streets

1733
01:37:59,874 --> 01:38:03,710
Opportunity,
the American-y dream

1734
01:38:03,794 --> 01:38:06,546
It's in the radio
It's superstars

1735
01:38:06,630 --> 01:38:10,550
The arteries and veins
that feed your heart

1736
01:38:12,136 --> 01:38:16,056
From the Dairy Queen
to the head of the parade

1737
01:38:16,140 --> 01:38:19,476
In a blink your
life could change

1738
01:38:20,936 --> 01:38:33,031
This could all
be yours someday

1739
01:38:33,324 --> 01:38:38,495
This could all be yours
Be yours someday

1740
01:38:40,498 --> 01:38:50,548
Someday

1741
01:39:00,643 --> 01:39:04,604
You come as Elvis Presley
every Halloween

1742
01:39:04,688 --> 01:39:08,566
And dream of sing-alongs
the whole wide world will sing

1743
01:39:08,651 --> 01:39:11,569
Into the great unknown,
Horatio

1744
01:39:11,654 --> 01:39:16,574
Desire and ambition
fuel this heart

1745
01:39:17,451 --> 01:39:21,079
So take a breath
and step into the light

1746
01:39:21,163 --> 01:39:25,208
Everything will be
all right

1747
01:39:26,043 --> 01:39:38,221
This could all
be yours someday

1748
01:39:38,305 --> 01:39:43,017
This could all be yours
All yours someday

1749
01:39:45,396 --> 01:39:55,530
Someday

1750
01:40:31,108 --> 01:40:55,548
This could all
be yours someday

1751
01:40:55,633 --> 01:41:01,971
This could all be yours
All yours someday

1752
01:41:02,848 --> 01:41:19,489
Someday

1753
01:43:06,847 --> 01:43:07,847
