1
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:17,923
Bunt!

2
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:22,723
Damn it, Bunt.
I told you to move that damn body.

3
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:25,457
Now do it. It's stinking the place up.

4
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:31,133
Here, boy.

5
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:38,872
Benzy!

6
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,342
Benzy, come on, boy.

7
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:03,328
Shoo!

8
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:07,529
Shoo, dog! Go on!
Get on out of here! Go on!

9
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:27,283
Wallace.

10
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:14,430
What a fine specimen.

11
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,506
Now, how could anybody want to
just throw that away

12
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:24,380
when it could be a new nose
or hide some hideous defect.

13
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:38,857
You is dead, Mr. Harley.

14
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:41,197
I seen you die.

15
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:43,735
You're living on borrowed time, Bunt.

16
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:47,637
Death is forever.

17
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:52,939
What you're doing is gonna cause you pain.

18
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:55,171
Sorrowful pain.

19
00:06:57,183 --> 00:07:01,483
Kind that just never goes away
until the day you die and on and on.

20
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:05,317
I know. You know I know it.

21
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:08,188
Look at you.

22
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:11,059
The child you were all stripped away.
Look at you.

23
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,630
Don't bring that vengeance back
for a second time.

24
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:17,794
Don't do it.

25
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:19,728
Don't do it.

26
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,177
You keep out of my head, Ed Harley.

27
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:33,509
You keep out of my brain.

28
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,850
You stay where you belong, in Hell.

29
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,459
Hello!

30
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:45,690
Is anybody here?

31
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:54,505
I need to use a phone.

32
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:58,441
I need to call the police. Hello?

33
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:01,105
Bunt Wallace, stop your hollering...

34
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:07,719
How in the hell did he get in here?

35
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:13,850
After him, boys.

36
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:17,790
Don't let him get away.

37
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,326
This way.

38
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:04,467
Come on. Come on. Come on.

39
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:21,156
Where the hell have you been?

40
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,922
I found this here dog in the swamp.

41
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:24,986
I bet that's the stranger's dog.

42
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:03,435
Shoo, shoo, shoo. Benzy, go on!

43
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:06,994
Shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo. Get out! Get out!

44
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:13,003
Hey!

45
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:17,046
He might have found something.

46
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:19,546
You got something there, boy?

47
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:29,527
We got a live one here!

48
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:32,695
Stop it, Tiny! Tiny, stop it!

49
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:37,228
No!

50
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:40,672
I'm not sure about this.

51
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,900
He's seen too much.

52
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:47,601
We can't let him go. Skin is skin.

53
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:51,774
And you know how much
a fresh kidney is worth.

54
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:55,153
Whatever you say, Doc.

55
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:56,711
That's my baby.

56
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:13,595
Pain is an interesting thing, gentlemen.

57
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:16,739
It doesn't happen here.

58
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:19,972
It happens in the brain.

59
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:23,839
And then the brain sends the message

60
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:26,375
to the body.

61
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:35,889
Beautiful.

62
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:43,367
You and Bunt get rid of him.

63
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:00,178
Yeah?

64
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:05,013
It's Doc.

65
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:07,491
You're late.

66
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:13,063
A kidney!

67
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:16,162
Whoa! Where did you get that?

68
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:18,332
How much can you get for it?

69
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:24,474
That's worth a small fortune.

70
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:27,943
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

71
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:30,547
I'm sorry.

72
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:45,356
Which takes care of the regular stuff.

73
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:51,370
Now, how about a little deposit
on that kidney?

74
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:55,965
Sorry, old friend.
I ain't got that kind of money laying around.

75
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,805
I write you an IOU.

76
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:03,611
And you think I can keep providing
free medical care for this town on IOUs?

77
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:06,583
Hey, Florence Nightingale.

78
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:10,645
You want to waste your money on charity,
that's your business. Not mine.

79
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,077
Help me!

80
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,881
You all right?

81
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:40,578
Oh, God, you okay?

82
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,814
Bodies. Corpses. Bodies in the woods.

83
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:44,719
Bodies in the woods!

84
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,849
- Wallaces. They're doing it.
- Who did this to you, mister?

85
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:48,188
Wallace Crematorium.

86
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:51,286
Wallace Crematorium?
The Wallaces did this to you?

87
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:53,263
Oh, God! Now, come on, now, get in the car.

88
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,357
You're going to be okay. Come on!

89
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:57,800
Oh, God, it's going to be okay.

90
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,937
Come on, now.

91
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,334
Oh, Lord, come on.

92
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,030
Sheriff Bullock, there's trouble.

93
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,397
Oh, boy, here we go.

94
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:32,528
A man's been killed out in the woods
by the Wallace Crematorium.

95
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:34,232
Just settle down, Molly Sue.

96
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:37,070
Is this another one of your episodes?

97
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:38,905
But he's in my car.

98
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:42,039
Are you two just gonna sit there?

99
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:50,254
Do you want me to call Oliver?
And have him come and get you? Huh?

100
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:54,087
You'll see. You'll see.

101
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,627
Hey, Sheriff, you better get out here.

102
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:08,001
Come on. Come on.

103
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,140
You pig!

104
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:12,776
Come on!

105
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:14,574
Keep your hands off of my brother!

106
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:16,979
- Well, now.
- Get in the car.

107
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:20,348
This certainly complicates things.

108
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:25,816
Why did you do it?

109
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:29,684
Well, you see, the oven's been busted.
I can't remember the last time it worked.

110
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:30,786
Shut up, Bunt.

111
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:32,763
Ain't you going to
read us our rights, Sheriff?

112
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:36,267
Scum like you Wallaces ain't got no rights.

113
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:38,530
You all are just like your Pa.

114
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,764
Cowards.

115
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:41,999
- You...
- Dahlia, no.

116
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,673
- You look after them prisoners.
- Yes, sir.

117
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:47,371
The news is gonna spread fast.

118
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:52,349
<i>And organize some volunteers from
the town. We've got to prevent a panic.</i>

119
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:06,658
Friends, I know these departed friends...

120
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:23,380
Did you see that?

121
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:27,447
- You know, I just thought that...
- Thought what?

122
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,455
That I'm still running around crazier than
a June bug in May because my baby died?

123
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:35,584
Sheriff, we just need to organize these folks,
and I got all the equipment we need.

124
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:36,753
What are you going to do, Sheriff?

125
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:40,390
I've got Doc Fraser here,
and I placed a call to the FBI.

126
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:43,264
They're gonna send a couple of
their top men out to investigate.

127
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,803
- When?
- In the next 48 hours.

128
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:47,862
And what about that man in my car?

129
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,568
I'll do an autopsy to determine
the cause of death.

130
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:51,666
Cause of death?

131
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:54,110
Can't prove the Wallaces
did anything otherwise.

132
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:58,445
Heck, Sheriff, I'm not even sure
what was done to these bodies is a crime.

133
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:01,577
Doc Fraser? The FBI?

134
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,981
And I thought you were the law in this town.

135
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,324
Oliver. Leave her be.

136
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,259
Whole town don't need to know
about you and her.

137
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:18,064
There's no "me and her," Molly.

138
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:20,769
Our mama's in there.

139
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:26,837
Spread out, now. Fan out.

140
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:29,073
All right, keep it going, boys.

141
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,107
We're getting closer.

142
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:41,483
Guys, over here.

143
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:44,485
We got something over here.

144
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,700
Oh, my God.

145
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,505
All right, we got to get them out of here.

146
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:08,546
- Let's cover it up.
- All right.

147
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:11,980
We done bad, Dahlia.

148
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,449
You know what centers on badness.

149
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:19,353
Pumpkinhead.

150
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:22,093
Shut up. Both of you.

151
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:28,404
Keep away from Pumpkinhead.

152
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:31,466
Unless you're tired of living.

153
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:34,637
His enemies are mostly dead.

154
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:37,682
He's mean and unforgiving.

155
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:41,309
Don't be a superstitious fool.

156
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:42,819
You hear me?

157
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:41,870
<i>No!</i>

158
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:17,911
I have never seen anything like this.

159
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:20,144
This is older.

160
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:23,380
Much older. Where did you find this one?

161
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:26,288
Deep in the woods.
There's an old pumpkin patch.

162
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:35,391
There are no children here, Molly.

163
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:37,992
What kind of animals would do this?

164
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,238
No!

165
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,642
No! No!

166
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,346
No, my baby.

167
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,282
No! No!

168
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:58,649
No, look what they've done.

169
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:05,496
Those monsters butchered my baby.

170
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:07,795
All right, Molly Sue.

171
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:14,769
I am so sorry.

172
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,068
No!

173
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:18,270
No.

174
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,651
- It's the old woman. Of the woods.
- The stories are true.

175
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:47,401
This one belongs to me.

176
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,939
Who are you?

177
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:54,309
You ought to have known better
than to disturb this one,

178
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:56,176
Sheriff Bullock.

179
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,009
Do I know you?

180
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,030
Molly.

181
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:24,973
Molly Sue, don't.

182
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:27,375
That woman is not the answer.

183
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:31,041
All the tools in the world
couldn't fix this, Oliver.

184
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:34,574
You're the one that lives
out by the razorback hollow.

185
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,115
People say you got powers,
that you can do things.

186
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:43,321
I can't bring back the dead.

187
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:46,489
People say you can help them
that was wronged.

188
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:05,142
- You all have to come with me.
- Where?

189
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,912
- To see the old woman.
- What for?

190
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:08,816
She can make it right.

191
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:17,886
- What are you doing?
- These ashes ain't your daddy's, Richie.

192
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:20,324
- You're crazy.
- I'm crazy?

193
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:23,960
You're crazy,
we're all crazy if we don't do anything.

194
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:27,300
Even Doc himself said he wasn't sure
what they did was a crime.

195
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,402
Are you all prepared to let
those sons of bitches get away

196
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:33,103
with what they did to our kin?

197
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:38,081
Richie, you know your daddy
wouldn't let them get away with nothing.

198
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:43,209
And I know you don't like me,
but we've been wronged.

199
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:45,119
Sheriff Bullock ain't going to do nothing.

200
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:48,023
The old woman will know what to do.

201
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:51,893
Well, I'm going if I have to go alone.

202
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:46,140
I know you're back there, Molly Sue Allen.

203
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,177
You brought your friends.

204
00:24:51,556 --> 00:24:56,391
Powerful price for what you're looking for.

205
00:24:56,461 --> 00:24:58,258
We'll pay the price.

206
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:03,530
This is everything we have. Everything.

207
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:07,163
What you want has a name, girl.

208
00:25:08,373 --> 00:25:09,931
What's it named?

209
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:14,171
Pumpkinhead?

210
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:21,484
No.

211
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:24,646
Vengeance.

212
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:32,121
Vengeance.

213
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:35,526
That what you want, girl?

214
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,592
Yes. Yes, it is.

215
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:45,369
Vengeance. Raw and furious.

216
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:48,403
Say it.

217
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,142
- Vengeance.
- All of you.

218
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,312
Say it!

219
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:55,109
- Vengeance.
- Vengeance.

220
00:25:55,186 --> 00:25:56,210
Vengeance.

221
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:57,846
Give me your hand.

222
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:18,535
This ain't your kind of medicine,
Ellie Johnson.

223
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,237
This more powerful.

224
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:24,009
Go ahead, Ellie. Do it for Mama.

225
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,716
Bunt.

226
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:17,125
It's all right.

227
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:19,026
Doc will come for us.

228
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,000
What the hell is going on in there, huh?

229
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:26,060
He's afraid of the thunder, is all.

230
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:28,605
- He's coming for us.
- Yeah, I bet.

231
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:35,211
- Doc?
- Well, open up.

232
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:41,918
Who's there?

233
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,019
Who is that?

234
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:08,575
You believe me now?

235
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:22,258
Junior, get the keys.

236
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:29,863
- Junior!
- Junior!

237
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,526
Oh, my God!

238
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:44,474
Molly?

239
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:03,095
Oh, my God. No, Junior, no. Junior!

240
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:08,061
- Hurry, sister, hurry.
- I'm trying! I can't even see it.

241
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,265
Hurry!

242
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:22,145
Come on, sister, come on!

243
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:26,381
Come on! Come on! Come on!

244
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:32,590
Get in the car!

245
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:41,535
Let's go! Come on, Dahlia, let's go!

246
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:45,734
It's coming for us. It's coming.
Dahlia, come on!

247
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:47,572
Come on!

248
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:56,216
Let's go. Let's go.

249
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:11,794
Someone's here.

250
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,804
- Who is it?
- It's a cop car.

251
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:16,773
- What are you going to do?
- Get out of here.

252
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:27,945
We're done for! Oh, man!

253
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:29,509
It got Junior and the deputy.

254
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:31,919
I can't believe it. Oh, my God.
Oh, no, no, no. No, no, no!

255
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,753
We got to get out of here or we're dead.

256
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:36,953
Hey, hey, hey, hey, relax.

257
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:39,258
Crystal meth you all take's
making you paranoid.

258
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:40,695
It came for us.

259
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:44,166
We got to run or hide!

260
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:45,759
Do something, damn it!

261
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:49,603
Oh, God, I love it when you get all fired up.

262
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:54,444
Jeez, you're like a piss ant on a hot stove.

263
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:58,571
Now, calm down and tell me what happened.

264
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:01,744
- Pumpkinhead, it's real!
- I knew it.

265
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:05,552
Did you get my meth from Lenny?

266
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,550
Give it to me!

267
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:13,790
Tell me what happened first.

268
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:21,833
If I didn't see it, I would not have believed it.

269
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:24,966
Well, did it...
I don't know, did it say anything?

270
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:26,908
Say anything?

271
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:30,812
It just kills. It doesn't stop for a chat.

272
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:33,579
Tiny.

273
00:32:35,386 --> 00:32:37,251
You get rid of that car.

274
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:41,759
Anybody sees that or you lot around here,
we got problems.

275
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:46,820
Bunt? You and your sister upstairs.

276
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:49,526
Till I figure out what we're gonna do.

277
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:30,765
I wish you'd stop taking all that bad stuff.

278
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,901
Makes your brain all fuzzy.

279
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:37,374
We got to figure out what we're gonna do,
or we're gonna die.

280
00:33:37,448 --> 00:33:38,915
All of us.

281
00:34:12,683 --> 00:34:15,516
It's open. What's the matter with you?

282
00:34:17,922 --> 00:34:18,980
Doc?

283
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:22,988
Oliver. Molly Sue.

284
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,894
- Can we come in?
- Sure, sure.

285
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:29,296
- We can come back if it's a bad time.
- No, that's okay. You come right on in.

286
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:31,460
I'm not feeling too well.

287
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:35,869
I'm sorry to hear that, Molly Sue.

288
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:38,135
You come right on through.

289
00:34:48,286 --> 00:34:49,583
Bunt!

290
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:20,079
You know,
I think the stress of the last couple of days

291
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:23,177
has caught up with you, Molly Sue.

292
00:35:23,254 --> 00:35:26,655
- You had a chance to rest?
- No, I haven't slept since...

293
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:30,820
- You went out in the woods, too.
- I went for a walk, that's all.

294
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:32,988
Thought it might help clear my head.

295
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:37,626
Well, after all that's happened,
I'm not surprised you feel lousy.

296
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:42,395
Do you remember those breathing exercises
I had you do

297
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:45,237
when you were a kid and you felt this way?

298
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:50,272
That's right, nice and easy.

299
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:55,883
And I... I think these might help as well.

300
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:05,695
Now, if there is anything else you need,
don't hesitate to call me.

301
00:36:05,763 --> 00:36:07,458
- All right?
- Yeah.

302
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:11,263
Reverend McGee is holding
a memorial service later on tonight.

303
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:15,101
- I'll be there, Oliver. I'll be there.
- All right.

304
00:36:24,148 --> 00:36:27,208
Well, we got to get you home.
Get yourself some rest.

305
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:19,859
It's here!

306
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:22,701
It's here! It's here! It's here!

307
00:37:22,773 --> 00:37:26,334
- It's Tiny. What's he doing on the roof?
- Open the window, Bunt. Open the window.

308
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,970
Open... Open the window. Please.
Please, hurry up.

309
00:37:29,046 --> 00:37:30,707
- Open the window!
- I can't. It's stuck!

310
00:37:30,781 --> 00:37:33,011
- Open the window!
- What the hell is all that yelling?

311
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,018
- Open up the window.
- It's Tiny. He's outside on the roof.

312
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,986
Bunt, Bunt, open the window.

313
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:38,112
Oh, no!

314
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:40,419
Help me! Help!

315
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:44,219
Come on! Help! Help!

316
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:55,603
- Tiny! No!
- Tiny! No!

317
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:57,903
- No, Tiny, no.
- Now you believe us?

318
00:37:57,975 --> 00:38:00,409
We got to get out of here! Now!

319
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:04,308
No! No!

320
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:07,145
Help me!

321
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:11,987
Molly Sue?

322
00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:44,946
No, no, Bunt.
Maybe it doesn't know we're here.

323
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:46,683
No, it's seen us.

324
00:38:58,202 --> 00:38:59,601
Would you get in the car?

325
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:03,231
- Or we're leaving without you.
- Come on, Bunt, come on.

326
00:39:03,307 --> 00:39:04,569
Move!

327
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,227
Molly?

328
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,602
- We asked for it.
- Doc, stop at Lenny's.

329
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:40,201
Will you two shut up? I can't think.

330
00:39:40,277 --> 00:39:43,212
But there has got to be an explanation.

331
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,508
We're marked.

332
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:47,676
Yes, you are, Bunt Wallace.
You reap what you sow.

333
00:39:49,286 --> 00:39:51,117
You're all marked.

334
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:55,448
No, it's not my fault, Ed Harley.
It's not my fault.

335
00:39:55,526 --> 00:39:58,620
Why don't you tell that to God
when you see him?

336
00:39:59,296 --> 00:40:02,959
I just laid down with the dogs and got fleas.

337
00:40:04,435 --> 00:40:06,665
- No!
- What the hell is wrong with you?

338
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:10,434
Dahlia, you keep this boy under control
or we're gonna leave him behind.

339
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:14,444
No, I'll behave. I promise I will, Doc.
I'll be good.

340
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:42,031
Doc!

341
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:46,805
Doc! I think Dahlia's dead.

342
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:51,581
- Is she dead?
- No, she's not dead.

343
00:40:51,649 --> 00:40:54,379
All right. You take it easy with her.

344
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:57,012
And you get your head out of your ass.

345
00:40:57,087 --> 00:41:01,217
Or you are not gonna have to worry
about this thing that's chasing us.

346
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,988
- Come on!
- Yes, sir.

347
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,103
Come on.

348
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:19,799
- How much further we got to go, Doc?
- In back of the church.

349
00:41:19,877 --> 00:41:22,937
Now, be quick
before somebody sees you two.

350
00:41:41,198 --> 00:41:43,564
Keep on going, Bunt.

351
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:47,764
This will be a safe place for us while
I figure out what the hell we're gonna do.

352
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:49,635
Put her down there.

353
00:41:50,307 --> 00:41:54,767
- She gonna die?
- No. Well, I don't think so.

354
00:42:01,986 --> 00:42:06,252
Bunt, what do you know
about this creature?

355
00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:08,188
You saw it when you were a kid, right?

356
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:18,057
- Bunt, this is important.
- I can't.

357
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:22,972
Is it any different?

358
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,668
It seems a lot bigger
than the first time it did its killing.

359
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:29,010
Who'd it kill?

360
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:31,941
<i>There was those city kids.</i>

361
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:34,576
<i>They done Ed Harley wrong,
they killed his boy.</i>

362
00:42:38,923 --> 00:42:40,356
What did Ed do to them?

363
00:42:40,424 --> 00:42:43,825
Ed Harley went to see the old woman
who lived out by the razorback hollow.

364
00:42:44,161 --> 00:42:47,255
I know who you're looking for.
Her name's Haggis.

365
00:42:47,331 --> 00:42:49,128
I helped him find her.

366
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:51,724
That's right, Bunt. You're telling it right.

367
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:56,098
- You led me straight to Hell.
- No!

368
00:42:59,443 --> 00:43:00,740
Bunt?

369
00:43:02,446 --> 00:43:03,879
Bunt?

370
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:05,947
Go on.

371
00:43:07,384 --> 00:43:10,148
I don't know what happened
at that witch's place,

372
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:14,247
but it must have been something bad
'cause it just started killing those kids.

373
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:21,156
What did?

374
00:43:25,669 --> 00:43:27,296
Pumpkinhead.

375
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:30,636
And, now, it's coming after us.

376
00:43:33,744 --> 00:43:37,737
It'll get those that are marked
and anyone who tries to stop it.

377
00:43:38,882 --> 00:43:40,577
I felt bad.

378
00:43:40,651 --> 00:43:43,245
I told Mr. Harley where to find that witch.

379
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:46,687
So I tried to help those kids get away,
and I almost got killed myself.

380
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:52,125
There weren't no killing it.

381
00:43:52,196 --> 00:43:55,324
- Well, something stopped it.
- Well, Ed Harley stopped it.

382
00:43:55,399 --> 00:43:56,457
How?

383
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:03,567
- You've got to ask him yourself.
- Well, now, I can't do that, can I?

384
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:06,007
Well, sure you can.
He's standing right behind you.

385
00:44:10,047 --> 00:44:12,140
He killed himself and then that girl shot him.

386
00:44:12,216 --> 00:44:13,843
Ed Harley shot himself?

387
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:19,180
He tried to anyways. She shot him dead.

388
00:44:26,897 --> 00:44:28,956
That's music from the church.

389
00:44:29,433 --> 00:44:33,460
Bunt, I want you to stay here
no matter what.

390
00:44:33,537 --> 00:44:36,734
- But what about Dahlia?
- Don't move her on any account.

391
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:43,463
Oliver. Molly Sue.

392
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:45,440
Thanks for coming out, Doc.

393
00:45:45,509 --> 00:45:48,342
- What happened to your head?
- My head?

394
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:55,082
It was just a little accident,
nothing to worry about.

395
00:45:55,152 --> 00:45:58,053
- How are you feeling?
- Oh, much better. Thanks.

396
00:45:58,122 --> 00:46:02,821
In Genesis, we know that God saw
that the wickedness of man was great,

397
00:46:02,893 --> 00:46:06,920
but that there was room for repentance
and acceptance.

398
00:46:06,997 --> 00:46:09,158
Forgiveness, friends.

399
00:46:09,233 --> 00:46:12,669
Sin is not born here in our minds.

400
00:46:12,736 --> 00:46:16,365
No, it starts here in our hearts.

401
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:21,503
But it is in our hearts
that we can also find forgiveness.

402
00:46:21,745 --> 00:46:26,045
We are gathered here, tonight,
in a spirit of hope and healing.

403
00:46:33,423 --> 00:46:34,754
Dahlia!

404
00:46:38,262 --> 00:46:42,631
- What happened?
- It's come for us. Listen!

405
00:46:44,535 --> 00:46:48,904
- It's out there. I know it is.
- How do you know it?

406
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,605
Listen!

407
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:08,014
We will go forth my friends
into a new peace...

408
00:47:11,762 --> 00:47:13,957
It is gonna be all right, Bunt.

409
00:47:14,031 --> 00:47:17,432
I just know Doc will take care of us.
I mean, he always has.

410
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:20,265
And find a place in our hearts for...

411
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:28,005
From dust we are born
and dust we shall return.

412
00:47:28,078 --> 00:47:30,706
Ashes to ashes, dust to...

413
00:50:10,073 --> 00:50:11,802
Ronnie! Ronnie!

414
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:15,208
- Hey, Ellie, Ellie. It's too late.
- No! No!

415
00:50:15,278 --> 00:50:18,179
- I'm afraid Ronnie didn't make it.
- No. No.

416
00:50:25,756 --> 00:50:29,351
Oh, my God. That's smoke. Move, Bunt.

417
00:50:36,066 --> 00:50:39,763
- Help!
- Let us out! Let us out!

418
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:43,034
Okay, all right.

419
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,880
It's done, doll face.

420
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:00,246
It's over.

421
00:51:04,027 --> 00:51:05,824
Oh, no, it ain't.

422
00:51:09,966 --> 00:51:11,194
No!

423
00:51:23,313 --> 00:51:25,042
Is this what you wanted?

424
00:51:25,315 --> 00:51:28,614
- This killing?
- Why did it come to the church?

425
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:33,048
- Molly Sue, you're not even listening to me.
- Who was it after?

426
00:51:34,224 --> 00:51:38,854
- Could be after anyone.
- No! Only those who are marked.

427
00:51:39,796 --> 00:51:41,627
Do you know how you sound?

428
00:51:45,035 --> 00:51:46,730
Ronnie's dead. Who's next?

429
00:51:46,803 --> 00:51:50,034
- The ones that did us wrong.
- Us?

430
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:52,302
Is there anything left of us?

431
00:51:52,976 --> 00:51:55,672
You're turning into a monster yourself.

432
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:09,657
Get him down from there
before somebody sees him.

433
00:52:09,726 --> 00:52:12,422
- But Doc...
- Can't leave him there.

434
00:52:12,496 --> 00:52:15,124
Do it for your cousin's dignity.

435
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:37,846
- You think I'm going to be all right?
- Yeah, I think you'll be fine.

436
00:52:37,921 --> 00:52:40,856
You just got yourself a little concussion.

437
00:52:55,772 --> 00:53:00,072
Oh, Tiny, I'm so sorry, this is my fault.

438
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:03,506
Oh, look at you.

439
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:06,310
Should be me, not you.

440
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:10,551
None of this should have happened.
Ed Harley was right.

441
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:13,680
Ain't no good
ever come out of no vengeance.

442
00:53:14,424 --> 00:53:16,449
Ain't no good at all.

443
00:53:32,509 --> 00:53:34,238
We've got company.

444
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:37,073
It looks like Oliver's car.

445
00:53:39,816 --> 00:53:42,910
You stay put, and I'll get rid of him.

446
00:54:01,137 --> 00:54:02,297
Oliver!

447
00:54:04,307 --> 00:54:07,538
- How is Molly Sue feeling?
- Awful.

448
00:54:07,611 --> 00:54:09,169
And I had no one else to turn to.

449
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:12,613
You know, you've been taking care of her
since she was a little girl.

450
00:54:12,682 --> 00:54:15,845
And I thought... Are you okay?

451
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:19,047
Oh, I was thinking, Oliver.

452
00:54:19,122 --> 00:54:24,116
It seems like the very Devil himself
has taken up residence in our little town.

453
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:27,863
That's something I wanted
to talk to you about.

454
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:32,565
Molly Sue went to see that old woman.
And she ain't been right since.

455
00:54:32,636 --> 00:54:36,163
- Did you go with her?
- No. God, no. In fact, I begged her not to.

456
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:46,772
Well, who went with her?

457
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:49,717
Richie and Ronnie Johnson,
the kid that was killed.

458
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:53,620
- Did anyone else go?
- I'm not sure.

459
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:55,715
Do you think that the old woman is a witch?

460
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:57,384
That she can do things?

461
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:58,893
I have no idea.

462
00:55:03,566 --> 00:55:08,401
All I know is, after what I saw,
I could believe anything.

463
00:55:13,009 --> 00:55:17,139
Oliver, I am truly sorry
for everything that has happened.

464
00:55:17,213 --> 00:55:21,172
We will find a way to put it right.
Stop it at least.

465
00:55:25,522 --> 00:55:28,047
- You're a good man.
- No problem, Oliver.

466
00:55:28,124 --> 00:55:30,456
- Thank you.
- Any time.

467
00:55:30,527 --> 00:55:32,188
- You look after yourself.
- I will.

468
00:55:32,262 --> 00:55:34,594
Oh, and be sure to
give my best to Molly Sue.

469
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:36,256
I will. Take care.

470
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:43,799
Oh, Tiny!

471
00:55:46,142 --> 00:55:47,404
Tiny!

472
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:03,985
- We've got to call this thing off.
- How are we going to do that?

473
00:56:05,261 --> 00:56:08,788
Ronnie's dead. My brother is dead
and he's not coming back.

474
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:11,060
That wasn't supposed to happen, Richie.

475
00:56:11,935 --> 00:56:15,200
We should have just
let Sheriff Bullock do his job.

476
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:18,139
What did you ask that old witch to do?

477
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:20,836
- Where's Molly Sue?
- At home.

478
00:56:22,846 --> 00:56:26,942
- She might know how to stop it.
- She doesn't want to.

479
00:56:27,016 --> 00:56:31,043
She wants to see this thing run its course.
Doesn't matter who dies.

480
00:56:31,121 --> 00:56:33,646
- Even if she passes.
- Ask the old woman, she'll know.

481
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:36,283
- Lf we go back, we could...
- You can't go back.

482
00:56:36,359 --> 00:56:38,987
You have a head injury, you need to rest.

483
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:40,359
I can go.

484
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:43,365
I went with them, too, to see the witch.

485
00:56:43,433 --> 00:56:46,402
I asked for... For vengeance.

486
00:56:46,469 --> 00:56:50,565
I'm sorry, Oliver.
I thought it was going to be justice.

487
00:56:51,207 --> 00:56:52,640
I was wrong.

488
00:57:00,517 --> 00:57:02,678
How are we gonna stop this?

489
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:07,579
I should dig three more graves, for us.

490
00:57:08,224 --> 00:57:11,990
How many times have you seen me
save someone's life in this town?

491
00:57:12,061 --> 00:57:15,121
It's what I do. It's in me. It's part of me.

492
00:57:15,198 --> 00:57:16,961
Or what makes you think
that when the time comes

493
00:57:17,033 --> 00:57:21,299
I won't be able to save my own skin
and you two along with me?

494
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:26,800
Besides, I am never gonna
let anything hurt my baby.

495
00:57:26,876 --> 00:57:28,173
It's just that I...

496
00:57:30,246 --> 00:57:32,441
I am a man of science.

497
00:57:32,515 --> 00:57:34,005
I study situations, Dahlia.

498
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:38,110
Eyes and mind always open,
always thinking.

499
00:57:38,188 --> 00:57:40,850
For every action there is a reaction.

500
00:57:40,924 --> 00:57:45,952
And in this case, it is those that visited
that witch that raised that monster.

501
00:57:46,029 --> 00:57:50,693
If we get rid of them,
our little problem goes away.

502
00:57:50,767 --> 00:57:52,928
And how are we gonna do that?

503
00:57:53,002 --> 00:57:55,937
Don't you worry yourself
about that, doll face.

504
00:57:56,005 --> 00:58:00,442
You just put your faith in the good doctor.
He'll save your ass.

505
00:58:04,614 --> 00:58:08,106
Dahlia, I want to go home.

506
01:00:26,222 --> 01:00:30,454
Why have you come back, Ellie Johnson?

507
01:00:30,526 --> 01:00:32,517
To see if there is a way to stop it.

508
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:38,924
We need to call it off.

509
01:00:42,372 --> 01:00:48,004
You did not ask for your wrong
to be righted, Oliver Allen.

510
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:50,806
But I did, and now my brother is dead.

511
01:00:51,414 --> 01:00:57,580
You thought you could just
call his name and that would be all.

512
01:00:57,654 --> 01:01:02,682
There are those who are marked,
and those who are damned for asking.

513
01:01:09,399 --> 01:01:13,597
I can't stand it. We're all going to Hell.
You have to stop it.

514
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:16,503
Can't do anything for you.

515
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:20,908
What if we right the wrong?

516
01:01:20,977 --> 01:01:24,208
What if we make things
the way they were supposed to be?

517
01:01:27,617 --> 01:01:31,417
That'd be some powerful magic.

518
01:01:31,487 --> 01:01:34,684
Can you teach me that trick, boy?

519
01:01:34,757 --> 01:01:36,987
He was just asking for me.

520
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:40,552
You are now one with vengeance,
Ellie Johnson.

521
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:42,689
It must run its course.

522
01:01:42,765 --> 01:01:45,256
You live and die by it now.

523
01:01:45,334 --> 01:01:47,802
I don't want vengeance anymore.

524
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:51,738
Ain't your choice now.

525
01:01:58,481 --> 01:02:00,676
You don't scare me, old woman.

526
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:03,241
Everything has an end.

527
01:02:03,319 --> 01:02:04,911
This, too.

528
01:02:11,494 --> 01:02:14,224
You know, I think we can fix this.

529
01:02:14,297 --> 01:02:16,390
We don't need no magic.

530
01:02:16,466 --> 01:02:18,991
Maybe if we cremate those bodies
the way they were meant to,

531
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:21,502
then the wrong becomes right again.

532
01:02:26,309 --> 01:02:29,938
I can smell you out there, Bunt Wallace.

533
01:02:31,614 --> 01:02:34,310
You'll find no pity here.

534
01:03:59,368 --> 01:04:02,462
- Richie!
- Doc, what's going on?

535
01:04:02,538 --> 01:04:04,130
I wanted to see how you were doing.

536
01:04:04,207 --> 01:04:07,267
When you didn't answer the door,
I was worried.

537
01:04:07,343 --> 01:04:08,810
I let myself in.

538
01:04:09,412 --> 01:04:13,041
Must have been out cold.
My head hurts, pretty dizzy.

539
01:04:15,451 --> 01:04:17,919
Let me take a look at this for you.

540
01:04:31,033 --> 01:04:35,436
- You Doc? Why?
- It's here for me, isn't it?

541
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:07,199
Who else, Richie?
Who else called on this thing?

542
01:05:11,307 --> 01:05:12,672
See you in Hell, Doc.

543
01:06:07,763 --> 01:06:09,025
Richie?

544
01:06:15,404 --> 01:06:16,735
He's dead.

545
01:06:22,345 --> 01:06:23,869
This is Doc's.

546
01:06:38,928 --> 01:06:41,488
How could Doc
have anything to do with this?

547
01:06:41,564 --> 01:06:44,761
Who else in this town would know
how to do that to a person?

548
01:06:46,235 --> 01:06:49,671
- Oh, God, what are we gonna do?
- I'm thinking.

549
01:06:49,739 --> 01:06:53,402
Maybe if we can get that crematorium oven
going and cremate the bodies,

550
01:06:53,476 --> 01:06:55,944
I think it would stop the killing.

551
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:57,343
And us?

552
01:06:57,413 --> 01:07:00,314
Do you think the others
are gonna be in danger?

553
01:08:20,296 --> 01:08:21,627
Molly!

554
01:08:22,898 --> 01:08:24,490
Molly Sue?

555
01:08:26,268 --> 01:08:28,361
- You're in danger.
- We're all in danger.

556
01:08:28,437 --> 01:08:31,998
Doc Fraser has something to do with this.
I think he killed Richie.

557
01:08:32,074 --> 01:08:33,939
And he's gonna kill everyone
that raised the demon.

558
01:08:34,009 --> 01:08:35,499
And that includes you.

559
01:08:35,578 --> 01:08:38,012
And people in this town think I'm nuts.

560
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:40,742
I know a way to stop this insanity.

561
01:08:40,816 --> 01:08:43,114
- Where are you going?
- I can't stay here.

562
01:08:43,185 --> 01:08:45,745
I'm going to the Sunny Days Motel,
anywhere but here.

563
01:08:45,821 --> 01:08:48,517
You're running away from the truth.
I can fix this.

564
01:08:48,591 --> 01:08:50,183
You've always been able to fix anything.

565
01:08:50,259 --> 01:08:53,990
But this ain't something
you can tighten with a wrench.

566
01:08:54,063 --> 01:08:57,521
- Molly Sue. Molly...
- It's over, Oliver.

567
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,659
- Molly!
- It has been for a long time.

568
01:08:59,735 --> 01:09:00,827
Would you just...

569
01:09:00,903 --> 01:09:05,033
And don't think I don't know about
you seeing that whore, Ellie Johnson.

570
01:09:06,408 --> 01:09:09,070
- Molly? Molly Sue.
- It's over and I'm gone.

571
01:09:10,179 --> 01:09:11,203
Molly Sue!

572
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:14,443
You and Pocahontas want to save the world,
that's your business.

573
01:09:14,517 --> 01:09:16,644
I'd rather burn in Hell.

574
01:09:53,455 --> 01:09:57,084
Bunt, let's go! Bunt, move!

575
01:09:58,227 --> 01:10:00,661
I am not telling you again!

576
01:10:01,363 --> 01:10:05,129
Bunt Wallace, stop playing your games.

577
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:08,102
What game is he playing, Dahlia?

578
01:10:08,771 --> 01:10:10,068
Where the hell did he go?

579
01:10:13,909 --> 01:10:15,399
I don't know.

580
01:10:16,178 --> 01:10:17,543
Oh, well.

581
01:10:17,613 --> 01:10:23,449
He can be the worm wriggling on the hook
for that son-of-a-bitch critter chasing us.

582
01:10:23,519 --> 01:10:27,250
Don't be a mean old man.
We have got to find him.

583
01:10:27,323 --> 01:10:28,620
Hey, take it easy.

584
01:10:28,691 --> 01:10:33,060
No, I will not take it easy.
And I ain't going nowhere without him.

585
01:10:33,128 --> 01:10:34,959
Or your crystal meth?

586
01:10:36,699 --> 01:10:37,757
What do you mean?

587
01:10:37,833 --> 01:10:40,768
Well, what's gonna make
you happier right now?

588
01:10:40,836 --> 01:10:46,103
Tramping around the woods looking for
your brother or a little of Lenny's magic?

589
01:10:46,175 --> 01:10:49,269
You know which one
you can't truly live without.

590
01:10:54,383 --> 01:10:56,681
Oh, it's all right, baby.

591
01:10:56,752 --> 01:10:58,413
I understand.

592
01:11:03,058 --> 01:11:08,621
Seems that roach motel Lenny calls home
is a popular spot right now.

593
01:11:09,365 --> 01:11:13,165
Well, I can kill two birds
with one stone there.

594
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:21,872
Open the door.

595
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:23,844
Your music's too loud!

596
01:11:23,912 --> 01:11:25,277
Who are you?

597
01:11:25,347 --> 01:11:28,009
I'm next door and I can't think.

598
01:11:28,083 --> 01:11:30,984
- Open the door.
- Coming!

599
01:11:31,053 --> 01:11:32,782
Open the door!

600
01:11:35,591 --> 01:11:37,718
- Open the door!
- Coming.

601
01:11:41,563 --> 01:11:42,689
Wow.

602
01:11:45,834 --> 01:11:48,962
- Why don't you join the party?
- No, I don't think so.

603
01:11:49,038 --> 01:11:50,801
Don't be shy.

604
01:11:50,873 --> 01:11:53,671
We've got everything you need.

605
01:11:54,576 --> 01:11:55,804
For a party.

606
01:11:55,878 --> 01:11:58,369
- Don't take another step.
- I just...

607
01:11:58,447 --> 01:12:00,915
Whoa. Take it easy, lady.

608
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:12,491
Crazy bitch.

609
01:12:24,273 --> 01:12:28,073
- Look, lady, I don't want no trouble.
- What's wrong with you?

610
01:12:28,143 --> 01:12:29,735
Open up, Lenny. It's us!

611
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:39,813
What the hell is the matter with you?

612
01:12:39,888 --> 01:12:42,652
- High or something?
- You'd better have saved me some.

613
01:12:42,725 --> 01:12:46,354
Some psycho bitch was just here,
waving a gun around.

614
01:12:46,428 --> 01:12:49,693
- Who was she?
- I don't know. Local girl or something.

615
01:12:49,765 --> 01:12:51,392
- This tall?
- Yep.

616
01:12:51,467 --> 01:12:52,695
- Blonde hair?
- Yep.

617
01:12:52,768 --> 01:12:55,202
- Big blue eyes?
- That's her!

618
01:12:55,270 --> 01:12:57,534
I just asked her to party
and she got all crazy.

619
01:12:57,606 --> 01:12:59,471
- Where is she staying, Lenny?
- Next door.

620
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:01,668
- You know her?
- Oh, yeah.

621
01:13:01,744 --> 01:13:04,406
We got some business with her.

622
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:05,970
But, first...

623
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:09,377
What you got cooking, Lenny?

624
01:13:09,451 --> 01:13:11,419
Lots of good things.

625
01:13:12,855 --> 01:13:15,255
- You want to see it?
- Show me.

626
01:13:33,142 --> 01:13:34,803
Let's get high!

627
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:55,924
Bunt...

628
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:00,532
What are you waiting for, Bunt?

629
01:14:01,003 --> 01:14:02,630
Get it over with.

630
01:14:04,973 --> 01:14:06,702
Run, run, run, run.

631
01:14:12,915 --> 01:14:14,849
Can you pass me the pliers?

632
01:14:21,757 --> 01:14:23,748
- Ellie?
- I'm Bunt Wallace.

633
01:14:23,826 --> 01:14:25,851
I know who you are.

634
01:14:27,196 --> 01:14:29,460
I don't like who I am.

635
01:14:30,532 --> 01:14:33,057
I know we done you folks a powerful wrong.

636
01:14:33,135 --> 01:14:36,502
But Doc said,
"It was to help heal the town's living. "

637
01:14:41,743 --> 01:14:44,405
He said,
"The dead don't know nothing about pain. "

638
01:14:45,948 --> 01:14:48,212
But he ain't right on that score.

639
01:14:49,852 --> 01:14:52,013
'Cause I know Ed Harley's still hurting.

640
01:14:53,388 --> 01:14:57,984
I know I'm gonna be punished
for what I've done.

641
01:15:00,028 --> 01:15:04,795
But until I do, maybe I could help you.

642
01:15:06,034 --> 01:15:08,366
You think you can help me
get this thing going?

643
01:15:10,272 --> 01:15:12,172
We could try.

644
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:23,651
Lenny, the master chemist!

645
01:15:24,953 --> 01:15:27,387
That was the best batch ever.

646
01:15:29,057 --> 01:15:30,388
Will you two hush up?

647
01:15:46,575 --> 01:15:48,042
Give it a try.

648
01:17:06,088 --> 01:17:09,057
- Ashes to ashes.
- Dust to dust.

649
01:17:46,928 --> 01:17:49,089
So what are you gonna do, Molly Sue?

650
01:17:50,632 --> 01:17:53,157
- Shoot me?
- Maybe.

651
01:17:54,469 --> 01:17:58,735
How old were you when I saved your life?

652
01:18:00,976 --> 01:18:03,376
How could you be one of them?

653
01:18:04,312 --> 01:18:06,837
I think you were 12.

654
01:18:06,915 --> 01:18:09,577
Or was it 13?

655
01:18:09,651 --> 01:18:12,643
Do you remember? Oh, no.

656
01:18:12,721 --> 01:18:16,384
Of course, you couldn't, could you?
Because you were too sick.

657
01:18:16,458 --> 01:18:18,949
I don't understand.

658
01:18:19,027 --> 01:18:21,393
They're just vessels.

659
01:18:21,463 --> 01:18:23,931
Those people aren't
in their bodies once they die.

660
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:25,660
They feel nothing.

661
01:18:25,734 --> 01:18:28,703
What about that hiker? You killed him.

662
01:18:28,770 --> 01:18:30,795
Oh, I had no choice.

663
01:18:30,872 --> 01:18:33,807
It was him or the health of this town.

664
01:18:33,875 --> 01:18:35,775
How else do you suppose
people around here

665
01:18:35,844 --> 01:18:38,039
afford the kind of health care I give them?

666
01:18:38,113 --> 01:18:40,411
It has to be paid for somehow.

667
01:18:57,632 --> 01:18:59,259
You can do it.

668
01:19:00,936 --> 01:19:04,497
- Ashes to ashes.
- Dust to dust.

669
01:20:08,103 --> 01:20:10,037
I wouldn't do that, Doc.

670
01:20:14,843 --> 01:20:19,542
I have only ever tried
to help people, Molly Sue.

671
01:20:20,982 --> 01:20:22,472
That's a lie.

672
01:20:24,753 --> 01:20:26,983
I didn't take your baby from you.

673
01:20:34,262 --> 01:20:38,289
You took her dignity.
You butchered her, you monster.

674
01:20:40,468 --> 01:20:43,301
You better put that gun down.

675
01:20:47,108 --> 01:20:48,973
You are not gonna shoot me.

676
01:20:51,646 --> 01:20:53,204
I might not have to.

677
01:21:42,564 --> 01:21:44,088
No.

678
01:21:46,935 --> 01:21:48,766
Hey there, darling.

679
01:21:48,837 --> 01:21:52,466
I think Lenny might need a doctor.

680
01:22:03,685 --> 01:22:04,947
Hey, what is it?

681
01:22:46,328 --> 01:22:47,989
Hey, what is it?

682
01:22:49,097 --> 01:22:51,759
- Hold me.
- It's gonna be okay.

683
01:22:52,734 --> 01:22:54,065
Trust me.

684
01:22:55,904 --> 01:22:58,634
We would have been good together.

685
01:23:20,762 --> 01:23:23,026
You's the Devil, ain't you?

686
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:25,823
Take me home.

687
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:06,701
I'm the last of those that summoned it.

688
01:24:09,477 --> 01:24:13,311
I feel it taking me. I'll be lost to you soon.

689
01:25:03,498 --> 01:25:05,523
Almost over, ain't it, Bunt?

690
01:25:06,768 --> 01:25:08,599
She's as doomed as you are.

691
01:25:10,338 --> 01:25:12,067
Make it stop.

692
01:25:12,807 --> 01:25:16,140
- That's right, Ed Harley.
- Make it stop.

693
01:25:16,211 --> 01:25:19,772
Vengeance is coursing through her blood.

694
01:25:19,848 --> 01:25:21,475
Poison.

695
01:25:22,417 --> 01:25:24,248
Now that's a sorrowful thing.

696
01:25:32,327 --> 01:25:33,624
Doc?

697
01:25:37,832 --> 01:25:40,960
I told you I could stop this.

698
01:25:42,837 --> 01:25:43,997
No!

699
01:26:34,789 --> 01:26:38,088
It didn't work, Oliver.

700
01:26:38,159 --> 01:26:41,128
It's still alive. It didn't work.

701
01:26:56,544 --> 01:26:59,012
Oliver! Look out!

702
01:27:06,821 --> 01:27:10,416
Ellie, no! Ellie!

703
01:27:11,826 --> 01:27:12,952
Ellie!

704
01:28:38,046 --> 01:28:39,673
What happened here?

705
01:28:40,581 --> 01:28:42,378
Where's Sheriff Bullock?

706
01:28:42,450 --> 01:28:44,509
He placed a call for some assistance.

707
01:28:47,121 --> 01:28:48,349
He's dead.

708
01:28:51,526 --> 01:28:55,519
- Who's responsible for all this?
- Vengeance.

709
01:28:56,164 --> 01:28:58,496
- Pumpkinhead.
- Come on, boys.

710
01:28:58,566 --> 01:28:59,590
- Pumpkinhead.
- We're gonna need to

711
01:28:59,667 --> 01:29:01,294
take you in for some questioning.
Let's go.
