1
00:01:27,651 --> 00:01:29,675
This is 911, what is your emergency?

2
00:01:30,517 --> 00:01:31,920
I need help.

3
00:01:33,506 --> 00:01:34,675
My brother disappeared.

4
00:01:34,676 --> 00:01:37,348
His name is Jacob Taylor, please...

5
00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:39,294
Please help us!

6
00:01:39,295 --> 00:01:42,157
Sir, can you tell me exactly what happened?

7
00:01:43,908 --> 00:01:44,908
I shot him.

8
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,144
I shot a man and my brother just ran away.

9
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:54,045
And he said someone was
waiting for him in the woods.

10
00:01:55,433 --> 00:01:57,746
Sir, I need you to calm down.

11
00:01:57,747 --> 00:02:00,506
I need to know what happened exactly.

12
00:02:00,507 --> 00:02:02,885
I don't know what's going on.

13
00:02:02,886 --> 00:02:04,247
Please!

14
00:02:04,889 --> 00:02:05,971
Send somebody!

15
00:02:06,634 --> 00:02:08,835
Could you tell me the
address you're calling from?

16
00:02:10,935 --> 00:02:12,142
Can you hear me?

17
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:15,458
Sir, can you hear me?

18
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:18,575
Sir, are you there?

19
00:03:11,492 --> 00:03:15,289
Uncertainty pollutes everything.

20
00:03:18,336 --> 00:03:21,332
It comes with a clockwork precision and

21
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:24,243
works without compassion.

22
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:32,406
And in the end we can't
do anything apart from

23
00:03:34,315 --> 00:03:37,316
staring at the walls, or

24
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:39,748
wandering through the rooms

25
00:03:39,749 --> 00:03:42,982
looking at the photos
that once meant so much.

26
00:03:45,551 --> 00:03:46,633
But now

27
00:03:47,996 --> 00:03:50,949
they only remind us of pain and

28
00:03:53,481 --> 00:03:54,801
uncertainty.

29
00:04:27,599 --> 00:04:31,131
I visited him on the 22nd of
November for the first time.

30
00:04:31,132 --> 00:04:33,538
I mean my brother, Jacob.

31
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:35,105
Jacob Taylor.

32
00:04:35,106 --> 00:04:36,841
Or JT as his friends call him.

33
00:04:39,335 --> 00:04:40,882
Although...

34
00:04:41,963 --> 00:04:43,224
as I think back

35
00:04:44,113 --> 00:04:45,844
he barely had any friends.

36
00:04:49,112 --> 00:04:51,793
At least I believe he lost
all of them by the end.

37
00:04:54,829 --> 00:04:56,518
By the 24th of November.

38
00:04:59,276 --> 00:05:01,378
The day when he disappeared
without a trace.

39
00:05:04,624 --> 00:05:08,887
Jacob never enjoyed being in
the city, though it didn't show.

40
00:05:10,971 --> 00:05:14,400
He tried to fit in and
put on a happy face, but

41
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,905
I often felt that something wasn't right.

42
00:05:21,437 --> 00:05:24,247
We had already been
together for a while then

43
00:05:25,247 --> 00:05:27,115
and he couldn't keep a secret.

44
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:31,953
You could easily see when he had problems.

45
00:05:33,994 --> 00:05:39,942
What did you say when he came up with the idea of moving
to that godforsaken place and leaving everything behind?

46
00:05:42,683 --> 00:05:46,902
At first I didn't like the idea of course.

47
00:05:48,364 --> 00:05:50,987
I couldn't imagine myself being there.

48
00:05:51,576 --> 00:05:55,417
I only agreed to move when his mother
was taken to the hospital.

49
00:05:58,118 --> 00:06:03,788
I realized that he needed this whole thing.

50
00:06:06,001 --> 00:06:07,168
And so that

51
00:06:09,002 --> 00:06:10,034
perhaps

52
00:06:11,152 --> 00:06:13,120
this could save our relationship.

53
00:06:19,761 --> 00:06:23,182
It's been nearly four months
since our mother was hospitalized.

54
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:28,184
Sadly our dad had already passed away and

55
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:32,303
at the beginning we visited
mom nearly every weekend.

56
00:06:33,928 --> 00:06:38,382
And one day one of these
sundays Mom got cerebral edema.

57
00:06:41,991 --> 00:06:44,618
The neighbour found her and
called us immediately, but

58
00:06:47,582 --> 00:06:49,839
we only saw her again on life support

59
00:06:51,126 --> 00:06:52,906
lying in an induced coma.

60
00:07:15,615 --> 00:07:18,611
JT didn't talk much.

61
00:07:20,111 --> 00:07:25,449
Still I can say we became
some kind of friends.

62
00:07:27,018 --> 00:07:30,874
He often helped me with my daughter,
sometimes he drove us around

63
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:33,285
sometimes we drove him around and

64
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,251
they also developed some kind of bond.

65
00:07:37,036 --> 00:07:39,319
I knew about his mother

66
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,510
and all that shit he went through

67
00:07:41,511 --> 00:07:45,914
and I dare say not many could
have had better than he did.

68
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,437
After a while he chose not
to work by car anymore.

69
00:07:53,438 --> 00:07:56,145
He said he didn't want to cause an accident

70
00:07:56,146 --> 00:07:58,457
by not being able to pay
attention to the road.

71
00:08:00,042 --> 00:08:04,269
So I often waited for him after work
and took him to the hospital.

72
00:08:06,023 --> 00:08:10,739
I often asked whether
I should go in with him

73
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,429
but he refused every time.

74
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,040
He said

75
00:08:16,114 --> 00:08:21,475
he wanted to spend that time with
his mother, just the two of them.

76
00:08:21,476 --> 00:08:24,335
And they needed privacy for that.

77
00:08:27,602 --> 00:08:29,719
I was

78
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,525
shocked

79
00:08:31,526 --> 00:08:35,037
when he told me he wouldn't
be coming to work anymore.

80
00:08:36,246 --> 00:08:38,005
It's

81
00:08:38,006 --> 00:08:42,316
as if everything that happened was tied
to that particular house and place.

82
00:08:45,787 --> 00:08:49,324
As I've said I visited him on the 22nd

83
00:08:49,325 --> 00:08:53,143
but Jacob had been already
there for a few days by then.

84
00:08:53,144 --> 00:08:57,345
The price was really low, just
the fragment of the average price.

85
00:08:57,346 --> 00:09:01,694
However it is also true that Jacob...

86
00:09:03,053 --> 00:09:06,055
Jacob didn't have much
more money than that.

87
00:09:11,815 --> 00:09:14,555
I had the feeling

88
00:09:14,556 --> 00:09:20,508
he would have chosen the very same house even if he
hadn't had a cent more money than the exact price.

89
00:09:26,082 --> 00:09:28,022
As he said

90
00:09:28,023 --> 00:09:29,905
when he viewed the house

91
00:09:29,906 --> 00:09:31,225
he instantly found peace.

92
00:09:32,648 --> 00:09:35,218
He loved it immediately because as he said

93
00:09:35,219 --> 00:09:37,336
he would be able to create
and relax there again.

94
00:09:40,962 --> 00:09:43,346
I don't believe he saw what
was waiting for him there.

95
00:10:07,933 --> 00:10:10,842
I could hardly name another
student who was like Jacob.

96
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,124
I'm not exaggerating when I say he was

97
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:17,434
interested in everything
and open to anything.

98
00:10:19,945 --> 00:10:22,652
I taught him in more than one class.

99
00:10:22,653 --> 00:10:25,483
I taught him creative writing,

100
00:10:25,484 --> 00:10:27,535
stylistics,

101
00:10:27,536 --> 00:10:30,587
dramatic and literary theory, among others.

102
00:10:32,872 --> 00:10:35,025
He took photographs and made films, too.

103
00:10:37,354 --> 00:10:39,789
Mainly experimental films

104
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:43,679
but he challenged himself in the
university's theatre company, too.

105
00:10:46,273 --> 00:10:48,296
He was definitely talented.

106
00:10:49,942 --> 00:10:51,959
Everything he made had a unique tone.

107
00:10:53,622 --> 00:10:59,428
All of his works revolved
around life and death

108
00:10:59,429 --> 00:11:01,492
and the incomprehensible between the two.

109
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:08,208
He was afraid

110
00:11:11,105 --> 00:11:15,012
that he wouldn't leave
a mark in this world.

111
00:11:15,013 --> 00:11:18,340
So he was writing all the time.

112
00:11:18,341 --> 00:11:22,092
Or at least he always
had something in mind.

113
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,075
I always listened to his stories.

114
00:11:28,997 --> 00:11:34,164
But when he got stuck and
suffered from writer's block

115
00:11:34,165 --> 00:11:37,066
he never asked for advice.

116
00:11:39,572 --> 00:11:45,439
Sometimes he was completely
exhaused at the end of the evening

117
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,693
leaving his notes and
thoughts open on his computer.

118
00:11:52,381 --> 00:11:54,447
Sometimes I go into the room

119
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:03,020
and imagine him

120
00:12:03,021 --> 00:12:05,244
sitting there

121
00:12:05,245 --> 00:12:09,699
in front of the screen,
in his typical posture.

122
00:12:12,446 --> 00:12:15,666
Looking at me and

123
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:17,732
smiling.

124
00:12:23,264 --> 00:12:26,736
The way he smiled at me when
we first met each other.

125
00:12:32,565 --> 00:12:35,044
The reason I fell in love with him.

126
00:12:37,949 --> 00:12:39,527
Before moving

127
00:12:39,528 --> 00:12:45,190
Jacob made up his mind that
he would send messages to mom.

128
00:12:45,191 --> 00:12:48,739
More precisely he would
prepare videos for her.

129
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:53,614
About him leaving the city, the new house,
moving away, pretty much about everything.

130
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:05,800
I had no idea where all this would lead.

131
00:13:10,603 --> 00:13:13,224
The case which I agreed to
take got its name quickly.

132
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:16,476
The Taylor-case.

133
00:13:16,477 --> 00:13:18,786
It already had that
name when I received it.

134
00:13:18,787 --> 00:13:22,402
Six of my colleagues had worked on it, but
none of them wanted to dig deeper into it.

135
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,871
Me neither, to tell you the truth.

136
00:13:25,872 --> 00:13:28,218
But in the end the pandemic
decided instead of me.

137
00:13:30,001 --> 00:13:33,108
I had to travel to England and
things started to escalate.

138
00:13:33,109 --> 00:13:35,261
And I knew I need someone
to deal with this mystery.

139
00:13:38,535 --> 00:13:41,391
People say that Jacob Taylor just
staged his own disappearance.

140
00:13:43,471 --> 00:13:46,008
That was only the surface.

141
00:13:46,009 --> 00:13:48,915
To say that this case is weird
would be an understatement.

142
00:13:50,585 --> 00:13:53,303
But I knew immediately who I
should ask to deal with it.

143
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:13,022
He wanted to begin a new life and he became fed up with
carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders.

144
00:14:13,023 --> 00:14:17,633
The state of his mother, his
derailed life, his bankruptcy.

145
00:14:17,634 --> 00:14:18,864
Was he bankrupt?

146
00:14:19,877 --> 00:14:23,872
Well, on the day he disappeared
he had only $104 in his account.

147
00:14:23,873 --> 00:14:28,156
According to the purchase agreement made
available to us by the real estate agent

148
00:14:28,157 --> 00:14:32,607
he acquired the house at a bargain price,
but still spent almost all of his money.

149
00:14:34,181 --> 00:14:39,383
You don't usually try to begin a new life
with $104 in your account, do you?

150
00:14:39,384 --> 00:14:43,285
I quickly understood why no one
wanted to work on this case.

151
00:14:43,286 --> 00:14:46,933
As one takes a look into the
files and gets to know the details

152
00:14:46,934 --> 00:14:52,002
it gets more and more confusing
and it just doesn't make sense.

153
00:14:53,336 --> 00:14:56,193
Why didn't you leave the
case to someone else?

154
00:14:57,517 --> 00:15:00,099
I didn't leave it to
anyone else, because...

155
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:10,932
I couldn't leave it to anyone else, because I knew exactly
how his brother, his fiancée and all his loved ones felt.

156
00:15:14,071 --> 00:15:17,288
My only unsolved case.

157
00:15:17,289 --> 00:15:18,512
My wife.

158
00:15:19,605 --> 00:15:20,929
What happened?

159
00:15:23,377 --> 00:15:25,213
The same as with Jacob Taylor.

160
00:15:27,845 --> 00:15:30,454
She disappeared four years ago.

161
00:15:30,455 --> 00:15:33,891
We had a fight, she packed
her suitcase and left.

162
00:15:35,323 --> 00:15:39,073
As far as I knew, she wanted to go to his
best friend's house to Indianapolis.

163
00:15:43,418 --> 00:15:44,965
She never arrived.

164
00:16:25,425 --> 00:16:26,837
Good morning, Jacob!

165
00:16:28,138 --> 00:16:31,604
It's Mr. Brozniak, your friend, Dane!

166
00:16:33,146 --> 00:16:36,474
Er, the broker's commission came
through today, thank you very much!

167
00:16:37,739 --> 00:16:40,641
So, I'll send you the rest of
the invoice tomorrow and um...

168
00:16:42,035 --> 00:16:46,939
You know I would have liked to give you
the keys myself, but something came up and

169
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,787
I asked my assistant to do it.

170
00:16:48,788 --> 00:16:53,843
And if she weren't able to reach
you, she will put the key in the nook

171
00:16:53,844 --> 00:16:56,661
about the door, so you can find it there.

172
00:16:56,662 --> 00:17:00,865
Anyway it's no so often that I can sell

173
00:17:00,866 --> 00:17:02,161
a special house

174
00:17:02,162 --> 00:17:05,453
so um, yeah, by the way

175
00:17:05,454 --> 00:17:08,964
there's a door and it's upstairs

176
00:17:08,965 --> 00:17:12,634
and it's locked and we couldn't
find a key and open it.

177
00:17:12,635 --> 00:17:15,618
And the former owner
you know, he's deceased.

178
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:19,300
And his son, who commissioned
the sale, he lives in Japan.

179
00:17:19,301 --> 00:17:22,121
We tried to email him, we
tried to phone him, but

180
00:17:23,446 --> 00:17:27,526
yeah, we didn't get in touch with him, so you'll have
to get a locksmith if you want to open that door.

181
00:17:28,786 --> 00:17:32,975
But anyway, have a good time there.

182
00:17:32,976 --> 00:17:35,828
I'm sure it's going to be unforgettable.

183
00:17:36,912 --> 00:17:37,949
Yeah, bye.

184
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,099
Okay, so here we are.

185
00:17:45,294 --> 00:17:47,290
This is the kitchen.

186
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:48,413
Sort of.

187
00:18:03,465 --> 00:18:04,498
Great.

188
00:18:07,223 --> 00:18:08,346
Nice.

189
00:18:13,368 --> 00:18:14,589
Ah, come on!

190
00:18:15,985 --> 00:18:17,437
Okay, let's see.

191
00:18:18,236 --> 00:18:19,889
Strange.

192
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:20,998
It's on.

193
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:22,179
It's supposed to be on!

194
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:26,745
Oh, God, I need to find an electrician.

195
00:18:27,081 --> 00:18:29,216
I brought this.

196
00:18:29,217 --> 00:18:31,956
See? I'm prepared!

197
00:18:31,957 --> 00:18:35,140
Okay, so to the right

198
00:18:36,259 --> 00:18:37,898
the bathroom!

199
00:18:37,899 --> 00:18:39,203
How charming.

200
00:18:40,711 --> 00:18:43,594
Thank God I can close it.

201
00:18:43,595 --> 00:18:45,792
Behind door number one.

202
00:18:47,438 --> 00:18:48,610
The living room!

203
00:18:54,754 --> 00:18:56,274
I thought it would be somewhat bigger.

204
00:18:57,159 --> 00:18:58,464
Or cleaner.

205
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,279
Nevermind.

206
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:04,302
Okay, going up the upstairs.

207
00:19:07,949 --> 00:19:10,718
It's great that all the
windows are boarded down.

208
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:18,723
The most important room.

209
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:20,039
Yeah, the bedroom.

210
00:19:23,804 --> 00:19:25,530
And two more rooms.

211
00:19:26,921 --> 00:19:28,821
Behind door number three.

212
00:19:28,822 --> 00:19:31,918
Eh, the toilet.

213
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:38,469
And behind door number...

214
00:19:40,907 --> 00:19:41,907
It's closed.

215
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,237
Well, this is it.

216
00:19:48,718 --> 00:19:51,937
We'll make it cozier, you'll like it.

217
00:19:51,938 --> 00:19:53,339
You'll see it soon.

218
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:58,158
I've been telling you since I was a kid
that one day I'll have a two-storey house.

219
00:19:59,523 --> 00:20:01,204
Well...

220
00:20:01,205 --> 00:20:02,378
Here it is.

221
00:20:05,717 --> 00:20:07,128
Great.

222
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:10,630
Shit.

223
00:20:12,642 --> 00:20:14,417
The door that hands can't open.

224
00:20:16,646 --> 00:20:18,568
I thought it would be somewhat easier.

225
00:20:20,734 --> 00:20:22,000
The hell with you then!

226
00:20:29,262 --> 00:20:30,573
I can't see anything.

227
00:20:32,472 --> 00:20:34,765
Why would it be locked if
there's nothing inside.

228
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:42,874
Ah, mom, I don't even want to know
how much this is going to cost.

229
00:20:44,964 --> 00:20:47,033
I just need to find the key to it.

230
00:20:59,408 --> 00:21:06,197
Let's find out if I can do something with the heating or
whether I'm going to need two blankets for the night.

231
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:28,106
Great!

232
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,356
I won't feel cold.

233
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:34,504
I'm just dying from smoke inhalation.

234
00:21:53,253 --> 00:21:57,520
It's unbelievable that we are literally
just a few steps away from the forest.

235
00:22:02,148 --> 00:22:04,351
If anyone should ask why I moved here.

236
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:08,210
This is exactly why.

237
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:19,368
I was fed up with the
superfluous chit-chats.

238
00:22:20,905 --> 00:22:22,539
The questions.

239
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,887
The people.

240
00:22:23,888 --> 00:22:25,506
The traffic.

241
00:22:25,507 --> 00:22:26,507
The noise.

242
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:29,836
The grey breath of the city.

243
00:22:31,456 --> 00:22:33,847
Not to mention that the
mornings were always the same.

244
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:43,283
It'll be so great to have lunch together.

245
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:52,523
We're cooking in the garden, but we might have
to wait a bit, until the weather gets better.

246
00:22:55,978 --> 00:22:58,041
How much we'll walk when we'll be here.

247
00:23:04,421 --> 00:23:06,994
This isn't exactly what you're
supposed to wear in the forest.

248
00:23:12,744 --> 00:23:14,104
That's strange.

249
00:23:32,117 --> 00:23:34,653
I still smell the perfume on it.

250
00:23:56,607 --> 00:23:58,627
Hey JT, this is John.

251
00:24:00,524 --> 00:24:02,301
Ah, yeah, you can see me.

252
00:24:05,214 --> 00:24:08,077
I don't do video messages too often.

253
00:24:08,078 --> 00:24:09,623
I hope you get this one.

254
00:24:12,311 --> 00:24:13,384
A few days ago

255
00:24:15,762 --> 00:24:18,335
Ben told me there might be no
signal where you moved, so...

256
00:24:22,096 --> 00:24:26,601
Look, I know things didn't turn out like
we expected at least as far as I see it.

257
00:24:28,386 --> 00:24:34,317
I know I made some serious mistakes, I wasn't there
for your mother when she needed me and I wasn't...

258
00:24:34,318 --> 00:24:37,546
the best stepfather
either, I'm sorry for that.

259
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:43,066
So many times in my life I screwed up,
I hoped I wouldn't do the same with you.

260
00:24:44,802 --> 00:24:49,072
I used to be selfish and didn't pay
enough attention to what you

261
00:24:50,203 --> 00:24:51,423
really needed.

262
00:24:53,996 --> 00:24:57,276
I ended up with a great new family, but...

263
00:24:59,168 --> 00:25:00,811
I wasn't there for you.

264
00:25:03,014 --> 00:25:06,506
I know you wanted to find a
place you can truly call home.

265
00:25:06,507 --> 00:25:09,036
Told me once about these plans of yours.

266
00:25:11,858 --> 00:25:15,835
Most of us spend our entire lives
in hiding, don't be one of them.

267
00:25:17,222 --> 00:25:18,815
There are people who need you.

268
00:25:21,642 --> 00:25:26,370
Look, I'm gonna visit your mother tomorrow,
I thought maybe I could pick you up and...

269
00:25:27,669 --> 00:25:28,842
We could go together.

270
00:25:32,005 --> 00:25:33,790
I hope we can reconnect soon.

271
00:25:45,307 --> 00:25:46,663
I heard something again.

272
00:25:48,116 --> 00:25:49,426
Near the front door.

273
00:25:51,308 --> 00:25:53,273
Like somebody was rummaging around.

274
00:26:39,106 --> 00:26:40,141
If all goes well

275
00:26:41,957 --> 00:26:43,698
Ben will stop by today.

276
00:26:46,369 --> 00:26:48,953
I want to take some nice
pictures in the weekend.

277
00:26:50,431 --> 00:26:52,398
I'll show you when I see you next.

278
00:26:55,449 --> 00:26:57,087
I just need to grab my bag.

279
00:26:58,976 --> 00:27:00,107
And my camera.

280
00:27:26,865 --> 00:27:27,941
What the hell?

281
00:27:41,224 --> 00:27:42,224
This isn't funny.

282
00:27:55,851 --> 00:27:56,974
The same scent.

283
00:28:01,902 --> 00:28:03,772
Lost scarf is available for pick up!

284
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:29,106
Hey JT, I hope you get this message.

285
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:34,971
I just want to say thank you for
helping me in work these past two years.

286
00:28:34,972 --> 00:28:40,649
Your kind words are always appreciated and
your words of advice were very beneficial.

287
00:28:41,884 --> 00:28:42,884
Look, um...

288
00:28:43,717 --> 00:28:47,453
The atmosphere at work has changed a bit.

289
00:28:47,454 --> 00:28:51,715
This may sound stupid, but I miss you.

290
00:28:51,716 --> 00:28:53,354
We all miss you.

291
00:28:54,965 --> 00:28:56,090
Look...

292
00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:00,484
I saw you left some documents on your desk.

293
00:29:02,314 --> 00:29:03,623
I put them in your drawer.

294
00:29:07,154 --> 00:29:10,522
That's when I found it.

295
00:29:14,476 --> 00:29:15,692
JT, um...

296
00:29:19,141 --> 00:29:20,218
I'm so sorry.

297
00:29:23,005 --> 00:29:24,738
I wish you had told me.

298
00:29:27,013 --> 00:29:28,378
I probably could've helped you.

299
00:29:33,785 --> 00:29:35,423
I haven't told anyone.

300
00:29:36,776 --> 00:29:37,951
And I won't.

301
00:29:39,805 --> 00:29:40,805
I promise.

302
00:29:44,946 --> 00:29:48,224
I mean I made sure your drawer
is locked, I have the key.

303
00:29:52,804 --> 00:29:56,788
When you come in and
sign your two-week notice

304
00:29:56,789 --> 00:29:58,007
we need to talk.

305
00:29:59,751 --> 00:30:00,751
Please.

306
00:30:02,446 --> 00:30:03,685
Take care.

307
00:30:05,473 --> 00:30:07,350
I just found this on my door.

308
00:30:10,867 --> 00:30:13,402
Now I know why I got the house so cheap.

309
00:30:14,773 --> 00:30:17,679
Pull over five times to check
if I'm still in the same state

310
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:23,376
and I kept on looking behind to make sure some fucking yeti
wasn't about to drag me into the shrubs for a buttfuck!

311
00:30:23,377 --> 00:30:25,635
I'm happy to see you too, bro!

312
00:30:25,636 --> 00:30:27,345
What's going on, bro?

313
00:30:27,346 --> 00:30:30,255
Test shots for the newest installment
of the Blair Witch Project?

314
00:30:32,322 --> 00:30:33,412
Hi, Heather!

315
00:30:33,413 --> 00:30:35,232
I'm scared!

316
00:30:37,068 --> 00:30:38,231
It's quite dark, isn't it?

317
00:30:38,232 --> 00:30:39,623
Yeah, I know.

318
00:30:40,446 --> 00:30:44,643
You wanted to disappear and by the looks of
things, you finally accomplished it.

319
00:30:44,644 --> 00:30:46,330
Yeah, but...

320
00:30:46,331 --> 00:30:47,740
Great place, huh?

321
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:52,527
I prefer the hustle and the
bustle of the city you know.

322
00:30:52,528 --> 00:30:53,402
Ah, I know.

323
00:30:53,403 --> 00:30:55,094
Come on, take a look around!

324
00:30:58,435 --> 00:31:00,188
Say hello to mom.

325
00:31:00,189 --> 00:31:01,456
- Seriously?
- Mhm.

326
00:31:04,647 --> 00:31:05,838
Hi, Mom!

327
00:31:09,228 --> 00:31:10,851
One round?

328
00:31:10,852 --> 00:31:12,731
I'll drive, man!

329
00:31:12,732 --> 00:31:15,007
There're crazy curves here.

330
00:31:15,008 --> 00:31:17,553
My car nearly skidded
off the road three times.

331
00:31:17,554 --> 00:31:20,474
But you don't leave immediately, so
I guess one won't do any harm.

332
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:24,381
Okay, let's smash it then.

333
00:31:26,405 --> 00:31:29,542
By the way, did you see anyone
while you were coming here?

334
00:31:30,673 --> 00:31:33,546
I haven't seen a goddamn soul for hours.

335
00:31:33,547 --> 00:31:35,189
No cars, no one, why?

336
00:31:42,076 --> 00:31:45,227
You've made some new friends already!

337
00:31:45,228 --> 00:31:48,807
This dude must have read
too much Agatha Christie.

338
00:31:48,808 --> 00:31:50,492
A love letter would have been nicer.

339
00:31:51,407 --> 00:31:54,744
By the way, what's up with Miss Four Eyes?

340
00:31:54,745 --> 00:31:55,650
Katie!

341
00:31:55,651 --> 00:31:58,196
Whatever, she's still gross.

342
00:31:58,197 --> 00:32:03,212
If she took away her glasses and glued a fake mustache
on your dick, she'd totally believe it was Magnum.

343
00:32:05,014 --> 00:32:06,705
You're a jerk!

344
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:10,562
Besides, the new guy
doesn't have a moustache.

345
00:32:10,563 --> 00:32:12,673
How would I know, I
never watched that shit.

346
00:32:14,068 --> 00:32:15,767
Anyway...

347
00:32:15,768 --> 00:32:16,768
She dumped me.

348
00:32:18,065 --> 00:32:22,561
So, from now on, you'll only date girls who
can actually see who they are going out with.

349
00:32:24,521 --> 00:32:25,844
Let's drink to that!

350
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:28,715
Only half!

351
00:32:28,716 --> 00:32:29,879
Alright, lightweight.

352
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:38,612
Let's take a walk!

353
00:32:51,242 --> 00:32:55,442
I'm pretty sure you have to spend
an absurd amount of money on it.

354
00:32:55,443 --> 00:32:58,395
Yeah, but at least I bought this
little palace next to nothing.

355
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,535
How much?

356
00:33:00,536 --> 00:33:01,536
40k.

357
00:33:02,476 --> 00:33:04,504
Holy fuck!

358
00:33:04,505 --> 00:33:08,215
I couldn't even buy a decent
apartment for that in the city.

359
00:33:08,216 --> 00:33:10,686
Yeah, that's all I had.

360
00:33:10,687 --> 00:33:13,971
Twenty miles further a house like
this would've cost twice as much.

361
00:33:14,875 --> 00:33:17,904
I can't even imagine
why you got it so cheap.

362
00:33:17,905 --> 00:33:21,178
Well, I'll definitely need to
spend some cash to fix it up.

363
00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:22,933
An on the garden, too.

364
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:25,238
There's only a shovel in the shed.

365
00:33:25,239 --> 00:33:28,984
Which I can use to bash the heads of idiots
who want to send me notes.

366
00:33:30,124 --> 00:33:34,209
It sucks that you've already pissed off
somebody after only a day.

367
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:37,767
What the hell did they want from you?

368
00:33:37,768 --> 00:33:41,114
Well, to leave, just like the note said.

369
00:33:41,115 --> 00:33:43,553
But to their loss, because
I'm not going anywhere!

370
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:47,533
Miles and miles without a soul in sight...

371
00:33:47,534 --> 00:33:48,805
Well worth the money.

372
00:33:50,001 --> 00:33:51,730
Like the hermit from Maine.

373
00:33:51,731 --> 00:33:55,774
Christopher whatever, I
don't remember his last name.

374
00:33:55,775 --> 00:33:59,545
He lived alone in the
forest for 27 years, huh?

375
00:33:59,546 --> 00:34:03,190
In harsh winters and frost.

376
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,811
I doubt I have that much time left.

377
00:34:06,973 --> 00:34:08,056
You're an idiot.

378
00:34:10,784 --> 00:34:12,033
Your nose is bleeding.

379
00:34:12,034 --> 00:34:13,034
What?

380
00:34:13,529 --> 00:34:16,436
Your nose is starting its period, wipe it!

381
00:34:19,828 --> 00:34:22,166
Ah, thanks, it happens now and then.

382
00:34:26,034 --> 00:34:27,034
Whoa!

383
00:34:27,944 --> 00:34:29,210
This is so hypnotic.

384
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,391
You and the forest behind
you and this gloomy weather.

385
00:34:36,944 --> 00:34:37,944
What do you want?

386
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:43,313
I don't know.

387
00:34:44,764 --> 00:34:45,795
I'm just...

388
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:52,621
trying to talk...

389
00:34:54,069 --> 00:34:55,069
I mean...

390
00:34:58,593 --> 00:35:00,279
I mean, the way...

391
00:35:02,746 --> 00:35:05,223
we haven't talked to each
other in a long time.

392
00:35:07,265 --> 00:35:08,265
Fine.

393
00:35:09,056 --> 00:35:10,328
Let's do it, I don't mind.

394
00:35:15,104 --> 00:35:16,104
I want to know

395
00:35:17,098 --> 00:35:18,449
what this whole thing is about?

396
00:35:20,774 --> 00:35:21,774
I mean...

397
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,075
what's going on with you, bro?

398
00:35:30,669 --> 00:35:32,032
It's really hard to say you know.

399
00:35:35,124 --> 00:35:36,627
I guess, I...

400
00:35:36,628 --> 00:35:38,544
never wanted to bother anyone about it.

401
00:35:41,106 --> 00:35:43,217
Because I'm the one who
has to face these things.

402
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:45,719
Things?

403
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,313
Our decisions.

404
00:35:48,436 --> 00:35:49,937
Everything that makes us who we are.

405
00:35:52,431 --> 00:35:53,431
Because in the end...

406
00:35:54,477 --> 00:35:55,477
it's just us.

407
00:35:57,618 --> 00:35:58,618
Alone.

408
00:36:00,601 --> 00:36:02,047
Full of...

409
00:36:02,048 --> 00:36:04,210
questions and regrets.

410
00:36:04,211 --> 00:36:05,211
You see?

411
00:36:07,584 --> 00:36:09,408
I think I do, yes.

412
00:36:10,308 --> 00:36:12,653
I was fed up with being how to feel.

413
00:36:12,654 --> 00:36:13,654
How I should feel.

414
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:17,759
They wanted me to laugh when I...

415
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,018
wanted to cry.

416
00:36:20,304 --> 00:36:23,258
They wanted me to cry when I just couldn't.

417
00:36:25,509 --> 00:36:27,341
They told me everything
would be alright, but

418
00:36:28,833 --> 00:36:30,238
they were only words.

419
00:36:31,241 --> 00:36:32,555
And I heard it from everyone.

420
00:36:33,584 --> 00:36:36,434
Friends, colleagues, you.

421
00:36:36,435 --> 00:36:40,366
Even from the girl next door who
never said hello, but somehow

422
00:36:40,367 --> 00:36:41,864
she just found out what happened.

423
00:36:47,266 --> 00:36:49,329
I often talk to mom, when I visit her.

424
00:36:54,685 --> 00:36:56,983
But I never tell her
everything would be alright.

425
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:00,817
Never.

426
00:37:04,081 --> 00:37:05,436
Because I know it won't be.

427
00:37:10,903 --> 00:37:12,167
And I'm sure she knows it.

428
00:37:15,744 --> 00:37:17,290
Somewhere deep inside.

429
00:37:21,194 --> 00:37:22,273
Even if she's

430
00:37:24,594 --> 00:37:26,189
not able to express it.

431
00:37:28,054 --> 00:37:29,054
Don't say that.

432
00:37:34,847 --> 00:37:37,569
But maybe this is the place
I need to write it down.

433
00:37:40,595 --> 00:37:42,522
To put all I'm feeling into words.

434
00:37:59,325 --> 00:38:01,667
I've never seen him so
sad and lonely before.

435
00:38:05,924 --> 00:38:09,444
But I only realized that
on my way back home.

436
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:17,051
I was driving slowly and was thinking about
those few hours I spent there.

437
00:38:30,762 --> 00:38:31,975
Fuck you, Ben!

438
00:38:36,278 --> 00:38:37,826
What should I do with it, bro?

439
00:38:44,569 --> 00:38:45,923
What the fuck?

440
00:38:46,956 --> 00:38:48,274
Who's there?

441
00:38:53,921 --> 00:38:55,519
I'm coming up!

442
00:40:41,879 --> 00:40:43,468
Maybe I'm going mad.

443
00:41:01,593 --> 00:41:04,025
Hey, Kim, little sis' here!

444
00:41:04,026 --> 00:41:05,057
Again.

445
00:41:05,916 --> 00:41:12,730
So I just wanted to drop you this VM to let you know that
I've got the tickets for the weekend Madness concert.

446
00:41:12,731 --> 00:41:14,227
Third row.

447
00:41:14,228 --> 00:41:15,384
I know.

448
00:41:15,385 --> 00:41:16,839
I'm so cool.

449
00:41:18,937 --> 00:41:21,525
Ah, I'm really not good at this, okay.

450
00:41:21,526 --> 00:41:24,659
So that was not the reason
I was messaging you today.

451
00:41:25,595 --> 00:41:28,165
I've actually had the
tickets for like a week.

452
00:41:28,166 --> 00:41:31,634
But I just didn't tell you,
I wanted it to be a surprise.

453
00:41:31,635 --> 00:41:34,995
And now I've just fucked it up as well.

454
00:41:34,996 --> 00:41:36,350
Dammit, I um...

455
00:41:38,161 --> 00:41:40,328
So you know I've got this friend, Mandy.

456
00:41:40,329 --> 00:41:44,647
We call her the Nun as she totally
looks like the one in that horror movie.

457
00:41:44,648 --> 00:41:45,641
Whatever.

458
00:41:45,642 --> 00:41:50,281
So she works in the hospital and we
were having a chat the other day.

459
00:41:50,282 --> 00:41:51,980
About Jacob.

460
00:41:53,499 --> 00:41:56,848
She was saying that after a
while he was spending like

461
00:41:56,849 --> 00:41:59,709
eight to ten hours there a day.

462
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:02,036
He was eating lunch and
dinner in the coffee-shop

463
00:42:02,037 --> 00:42:07,074
and some days he even
slept in the waiting area.

464
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:10,137
And the strangest thing

465
00:42:10,138 --> 00:42:12,622
is that he was even there when
her mother was also there.

466
00:42:13,407 --> 00:42:15,049
Like just a few hours earlier.

467
00:42:17,806 --> 00:42:20,572
I really hope you get
this before you set off.

468
00:42:20,573 --> 00:42:23,813
And I'm not trying to tell you what
to do, I just want you to be careful.

469
00:42:24,901 --> 00:42:28,047
And I'm not trying to tell you
some dumb shit either about

470
00:42:28,048 --> 00:42:31,805
like how you could do so much
better or why you're still with him.

471
00:42:34,666 --> 00:42:38,075
But there's something really
really strange about him like

472
00:42:38,076 --> 00:42:42,154
he's secretive and he's just not
the same person we knew before.

473
00:42:44,046 --> 00:42:47,750
And this whole case with his
mother is really strange.

474
00:42:51,712 --> 00:42:54,291
Strange things have happened
in the past few days mom.

475
00:42:55,719 --> 00:42:58,429
Maybe the strangest was last night.

476
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,539
There were people around the house.

477
00:43:02,546 --> 00:43:05,328
Fortunately everything is calm now, but

478
00:43:05,329 --> 00:43:08,485
I'm thinking about exploring
the local neighborhood

479
00:43:08,486 --> 00:43:10,645
asking them about troublemakers.

480
00:43:12,818 --> 00:43:13,818
"Neighborhood".

481
00:43:19,547 --> 00:43:20,720
What the fuck?

482
00:43:29,966 --> 00:43:31,042
Six lanterns.

483
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:39,539
Six crosses.

484
00:43:43,451 --> 00:43:45,840
Nobody told me there's a
graveyard in the forest.

485
00:43:47,505 --> 00:43:48,538
Fuck.

486
00:44:07,547 --> 00:44:09,145
Hi Jacob, it's me.

487
00:44:11,082 --> 00:44:13,610
I was about to visit you, but

488
00:44:15,476 --> 00:44:16,476
um...

489
00:44:19,364 --> 00:44:21,098
I thought

490
00:44:21,897 --> 00:44:24,005
that I made the right decision

491
00:44:25,847 --> 00:44:28,607
by leaving this whole moving thing to you.

492
00:44:32,534 --> 00:44:34,509
By letting you go to that place.

493
00:44:35,975 --> 00:44:40,988
And after a while you'd realize that
maybe it was better to be with me.

494
00:44:43,022 --> 00:44:46,537
But I never saw any sign you
wanted to come back with me.

495
00:44:51,211 --> 00:44:52,900
Both of us made mistakes.

496
00:44:54,804 --> 00:44:56,441
Mine was letting you go.

497
00:45:02,964 --> 00:45:05,507
You know where the keys are.

498
00:45:05,508 --> 00:45:07,613
Front door, upper lock, gate, everything.

499
00:45:12,268 --> 00:45:13,584
I'll see you at home.

500
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,351
Is anyone here?

501
00:45:50,894 --> 00:45:51,894
What?

502
00:45:56,372 --> 00:45:57,372
My god!

503
00:46:01,435 --> 00:46:02,563
It opens.

504
00:46:05,069 --> 00:46:06,515
By itself.

505
00:46:16,659 --> 00:46:17,968
What the fuck?

506
00:46:29,466 --> 00:46:31,676
Don't ever come to life for fuck's sake.

507
00:46:38,361 --> 00:46:39,440
Alright, JT!

508
00:46:40,665 --> 00:46:43,949
This is the moment your brain must
alarm you to get the hell out of here.

509
00:46:45,382 --> 00:46:47,393
You know where the car key is.

510
00:46:48,307 --> 00:46:50,740
You can always go to Kim or Ben.

511
00:46:55,901 --> 00:46:57,019
The same scent.

512
00:46:58,472 --> 00:46:59,472
Fuck!

513
00:46:59,707 --> 00:47:03,410
Early signs of mental illness or
you're preparing for a garage sale?

514
00:47:03,411 --> 00:47:05,091
Go fuck yourself!

515
00:47:05,092 --> 00:47:07,020
How could you come in at all?

516
00:47:07,021 --> 00:47:08,535
The door was open.

517
00:47:08,536 --> 00:47:12,427
I came to see you and maybe to
get drunk later if it's okay.

518
00:47:13,759 --> 00:47:15,462
By the way...

519
00:47:15,463 --> 00:47:16,468
what's up with Kim?

520
00:47:16,469 --> 00:47:17,921
She never came here.

521
00:47:19,681 --> 00:47:21,758
Sorry to say so, but it's no surprise.

522
00:47:21,759 --> 00:47:23,697
Don't fuck with me I'm
not in the mood for it.

523
00:47:25,026 --> 00:47:26,715
Just help me look around!

524
00:47:27,646 --> 00:47:30,285
Have you found anything interesting?

525
00:47:30,286 --> 00:47:31,606
Look at them.

526
00:47:32,397 --> 00:47:34,317
It's not by chance someone kept them.

527
00:47:46,349 --> 00:47:48,262
They're looking at the same direction.

528
00:47:48,263 --> 00:47:49,207
What?

529
00:47:49,208 --> 00:47:52,105
The mannequin and the toys.

530
00:47:52,106 --> 00:47:54,358
They're looking at the same direction.

531
00:47:54,359 --> 00:47:55,814
Let's take a closer look.

532
00:48:02,736 --> 00:48:03,736
It's hollow.

533
00:48:08,885 --> 00:48:09,885
Okay.

534
00:48:16,715 --> 00:48:18,001
What?

535
00:48:18,002 --> 00:48:19,307
My bad!

536
00:48:19,308 --> 00:48:20,429
Fuck you, Ben!

537
00:48:24,364 --> 00:48:25,364
Yeah!

538
00:48:31,265 --> 00:48:32,088
Yeah, yeah!

539
00:48:32,089 --> 00:48:33,448
Go, go, go, go, go!

540
00:48:34,848 --> 00:48:35,848
Look at that!

541
00:48:38,475 --> 00:48:39,475
It's a book.

542
00:48:43,048 --> 00:48:44,314
Wait a second.

543
00:48:45,037 --> 00:48:47,503
Yesterday

544
00:48:47,504 --> 00:48:49,090
I found a drawing.

545
00:48:51,522 --> 00:48:53,106
It was in the attic.

546
00:48:55,729 --> 00:48:56,729
Look at that.

547
00:48:57,712 --> 00:48:58,712
It matches.

548
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:04,082
It's not a book, it's a box!

549
00:49:05,719 --> 00:49:07,311
We need to play it with something.

550
00:49:10,952 --> 00:49:12,680
It's getting more and more creepy.

551
00:49:12,681 --> 00:49:16,170
Just look around, look
for a camera or a player.

552
00:49:16,171 --> 00:49:17,869
Anything it fits into.

553
00:49:17,870 --> 00:49:20,037
Shit, shit, shit!

554
00:49:21,505 --> 00:49:23,057
What the fuck?!

555
00:49:23,058 --> 00:49:25,791
I've just found it in this shit.

556
00:49:25,792 --> 00:49:26,671
What?

557
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:30,816
It was in this fucking table,
a gun, I guess it's loaded!

558
00:49:30,817 --> 00:49:32,596
Let me see.

559
00:49:32,597 --> 00:49:35,097
I'm fed up, that's all!

560
00:49:35,098 --> 00:49:36,194
Hey!

561
00:49:36,195 --> 00:49:38,153
Don't you want to see what is on the tape?

562
00:49:38,154 --> 00:49:39,955
I don't give a shit!

563
00:49:39,956 --> 00:49:41,178
Ben!

564
00:49:42,023 --> 00:49:43,498
Just show it to me.

565
00:49:43,499 --> 00:49:44,634
No fucking way!

566
00:49:45,505 --> 00:49:49,817
I don't want you to start shooting wearing
only your fucking underpants for fuck's sake!

567
00:49:49,818 --> 00:49:50,794
Where are you going?

568
00:49:50,795 --> 00:49:52,081
Where are we going?!

569
00:49:52,082 --> 00:49:54,846
Because you can't stay
here, you better understand!

570
00:49:57,811 --> 00:49:59,387
You bring your stuff to me.

571
00:49:59,388 --> 00:50:00,416
There is a couch.

572
00:50:00,417 --> 00:50:03,653
I wouldn't say it so comfy, but
you have to stop this right now!

573
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:07,891
It's not that simple, you don't know the
things I've been and am going through.

574
00:50:07,892 --> 00:50:09,801
She's my mother, too!

575
00:50:11,672 --> 00:50:14,534
My mother is also in that fucking hospital!

576
00:50:15,915 --> 00:50:20,035
While you're acting like
a fucking complete idiot

577
00:50:20,036 --> 00:50:22,396
like a fucking lunatic hermit

578
00:50:22,397 --> 00:50:24,509
mom's condition's getting worse!

579
00:50:25,916 --> 00:50:27,246
She's getting worse?

580
00:50:27,247 --> 00:50:30,443
Yes, welcome back, bro!

581
00:50:32,145 --> 00:50:34,499
I can't go back, you understand?

582
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,471
Here, I can talk to mom.

583
00:50:36,472 --> 00:50:38,576
It's almost like she's here with me.

584
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:41,842
I know it sounds crazy and I
want to see her one day, but...

585
00:50:41,843 --> 00:50:44,756
See her while you still can!

586
00:50:48,467 --> 00:50:50,344
You have to let me go now Ben.

587
00:50:52,317 --> 00:50:53,233
Jacob.

588
00:50:53,234 --> 00:50:54,719
Just...

589
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:55,720
Go, please.

590
00:50:56,647 --> 00:50:59,338
Everything will be alright, believe me.

591
00:50:59,339 --> 00:51:00,339
Just go now.

592
00:51:05,591 --> 00:51:06,706
And leave the gun here.

593
00:51:06,707 --> 00:51:08,054
No fucking way!

594
00:51:10,036 --> 00:51:11,577
I heard something again.

595
00:51:12,855 --> 00:51:14,595
I'm getting sick of it.

596
00:51:16,002 --> 00:51:18,153
It sounded like...

597
00:51:23,201 --> 00:51:24,516
Is anybody here?

598
00:51:31,721 --> 00:51:33,264
What do you want from me?

599
00:51:36,631 --> 00:51:38,130
Do you want to hurt me?

600
00:51:45,561 --> 00:51:47,063
Do you want me to...

601
00:51:47,972 --> 00:51:49,240
To leave?

602
00:52:00,105 --> 00:52:01,608
Do you live here?

603
00:52:01,609 --> 00:52:04,753
I mean, did you leave here?

604
00:52:08,692 --> 00:52:09,817
Okay.

605
00:52:10,787 --> 00:52:12,426
Okay, okay.

606
00:52:15,714 --> 00:52:17,215
Are you alone?

607
00:52:22,524 --> 00:52:23,648
Fucking hell!

608
00:52:28,282 --> 00:52:30,018
How many are you?

609
00:52:41,951 --> 00:52:42,951
Six.

610
00:52:43,879 --> 00:52:46,007
Six crosses.

611
00:52:46,008 --> 00:52:47,558
Six lanterns.

612
00:52:49,643 --> 00:52:51,408
What do you want from me?

613
00:52:51,409 --> 00:52:52,621
Why me?

614
00:52:55,733 --> 00:52:58,426
Do you want me to

615
00:52:58,427 --> 00:52:59,834
help you?

616
00:53:04,121 --> 00:53:05,714
How can I help you?

617
00:53:07,279 --> 00:53:09,696
Do you want me to

618
00:53:09,697 --> 00:53:11,290
find something?

619
00:53:16,716 --> 00:53:18,080
In the room.

620
00:53:19,554 --> 00:53:20,965
It's in the room, right?

621
00:53:22,694 --> 00:53:24,488
The tape.

622
00:53:24,489 --> 00:53:26,218
There's something on the tape.

623
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:34,204
Let's see if there's anything here.

624
00:56:50,176 --> 00:56:51,400
My dear god.

625
00:57:02,759 --> 00:57:03,759
The scarf.

626
00:57:06,638 --> 00:57:07,817
It's yours, right?

627
00:57:17,998 --> 00:57:19,498
I'm really sorry for what happened.

628
00:57:22,608 --> 00:57:23,684
I am.

629
00:57:26,618 --> 00:57:27,652
I'm just...

630
00:57:29,301 --> 00:57:31,461
I don't think I'm the one who can help.

631
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:37,375
I'll bring the tape to the police.

632
00:57:37,376 --> 00:57:38,873
I'll show it to them.

633
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:46,165
I'm sorry.

634
00:58:01,509 --> 00:58:02,874
That's impossible.

635
00:59:50,149 --> 00:59:51,275
Who's there?

636
01:00:05,094 --> 01:00:06,361
What's happening here?

637
01:00:25,531 --> 01:00:26,894
Shit!

638
01:00:28,285 --> 01:00:29,285
What?

639
01:00:34,702 --> 01:00:35,702
Jacob!

640
01:00:36,731 --> 01:00:37,731
Stop!

641
01:00:40,104 --> 01:00:41,144
What the fuck is going on?

642
01:00:41,733 --> 01:00:43,653
What the fuck is going on?!

643
01:00:44,951 --> 01:00:47,309
You'll be waited in the woods.

644
01:00:47,591 --> 01:00:48,759
Are you alright?

645
01:00:49,506 --> 01:00:50,673
For fuck's sake, are you alright?

646
01:00:50,674 --> 01:00:51,787
Let me go!

647
01:00:52,737 --> 01:00:53,815
Jacob!

648
01:00:56,171 --> 01:00:57,361
Jacob!

649
01:00:59,548 --> 01:01:00,995
Say something!

650
01:01:05,856 --> 01:01:07,747
This is 911, what is your emergency?

651
01:01:08,689 --> 01:01:10,097
I need help.

652
01:01:11,633 --> 01:01:13,714
My brother disappeared.

653
01:01:13,715 --> 01:01:15,449
His name is Jacob Taylor, please...

654
01:01:16,113 --> 01:01:17,569
Please, help us.

655
01:01:17,570 --> 01:01:20,194
Sir, can you tell me exactly what happened?

656
01:01:22,134 --> 01:01:23,134
I shot him.

657
01:01:25,299 --> 01:01:27,457
I shot a man and my brother just ran away.

658
01:01:29,669 --> 01:01:32,019
And said someone was waiting
for him in the woods.

659
01:01:33,151 --> 01:01:35,151
Could you tell me the
address you're calling from?

660
01:01:37,374 --> 01:01:38,374
Can you hear me?

661
01:01:39,878 --> 01:01:41,944
Sir, can you hear me?

662
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:47,243
I'll see you at home.

663
01:01:50,393 --> 01:01:52,789
That was the last thing I told him.

664
01:01:57,364 --> 01:01:59,737
He knew

665
01:01:59,738 --> 01:02:01,844
we wouldn't see each other again.

666
01:02:10,521 --> 01:02:13,103
After the police had searched the house

667
01:02:14,885 --> 01:02:18,921
things began to make more sense,
when they found Jacob's lab results.

668
01:02:20,564 --> 01:02:25,489
He only had two or three months left.

669
01:02:28,925 --> 01:02:30,192
But as it turned out

670
01:02:31,521 --> 01:02:34,148
he refused any kind of treatment.

671
01:02:36,881 --> 01:02:41,573
I always thought he went to the hospital
so frequently because of his mother.

672
01:02:43,225 --> 01:02:47,489
But everything became clear
after his brother called me.

673
01:02:51,086 --> 01:02:55,110
He barely ever said anything
in the car during those trips

674
01:02:56,791 --> 01:02:59,378
but as I drive along that route

675
01:03:00,769 --> 01:03:05,411
I miss him every single day.

676
01:03:09,579 --> 01:03:12,204
I don't sleep well since that night.

677
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:18,985
I watch the TV or read something.

678
01:03:22,274 --> 01:03:24,897
Then I find myself recalling a memory.

679
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:28,349
He stood up as if nothing had happened.

680
01:03:30,354 --> 01:03:32,043
He looked at me for a few seconds

681
01:03:33,352 --> 01:03:34,801
and left the house.

682
01:03:38,023 --> 01:03:41,423
I thought he had started to panic

683
01:03:41,424 --> 01:03:42,826
and needed some fresh air

684
01:03:44,346 --> 01:03:45,895
but when I...

685
01:03:46,975 --> 01:03:48,572
when I went after him later

686
01:03:50,572 --> 01:03:52,310
I couldn't find him anywhere.

687
01:03:54,511 --> 01:03:57,419
That was the point when you
called the police, right?

688
01:03:58,903 --> 01:03:59,937
Yes.

689
01:04:21,082 --> 01:04:25,286
During the investigation, six
bodies were found in the graves.

690
01:04:25,287 --> 01:04:31,637
The remains of four women and two infants
who disappeared between 1995 and 2006.

691
01:04:31,638 --> 01:04:36,418
In each case, the murderer was Randy Black,
the former owner of the house.

692
01:04:37,535 --> 01:04:40,872
During the search of the
house we found several diaries

693
01:04:40,873 --> 01:04:43,695
in which Black had described
everything in detail

694
01:04:43,696 --> 01:04:46,378
as if it had been some
kind of a confession.

695
01:04:46,379 --> 01:04:51,066
One of the women was his wife, but she was
the only one who had come there voluntarily.

696
01:04:51,993 --> 01:04:54,661
They had a daughter, but
according to Black's writings

697
01:04:54,662 --> 01:04:59,491
his wife cheated on him, so he
killed her and their daughter, too.

698
01:05:01,444 --> 01:05:08,094
He became obsessed with the idea of living
here in perfect harmony with his new family.

699
01:05:09,536 --> 01:05:13,615
Almost every line he wrote revealed that he
felt immense guilt about the murders.

700
01:05:14,681 --> 01:05:17,028
In the meantime he went bankrupt

701
01:05:17,029 --> 01:05:19,283
and eventually he was
forced to leave the house.

702
01:05:20,324 --> 01:05:23,882
We interviewed several people in the
surrounding area and many thought

703
01:05:23,883 --> 01:05:26,371
they had seen Black in the past few years

704
01:05:26,372 --> 01:05:29,935
but only a few remembered
him or knew much about him.

705
01:05:47,588 --> 01:05:50,822
A few days later I received
a package from Trott.

706
01:05:57,045 --> 01:06:00,516
A flashdrive with video
taken with Jacob's phone.

707
01:06:03,634 --> 01:06:08,130
His phone recorded almost two minutes of
footage right after he left the house.

708
01:06:52,667 --> 01:06:56,315
I wanted to believe that somebody had
intended this whole thing as a joke.

709
01:07:00,265 --> 01:07:05,786
But as the other recordings were viewed,
I realised that everything we saw

710
01:07:05,787 --> 01:07:07,198
were most likely true.

711
01:07:10,528 --> 01:07:12,266
He was never alone.

712
01:07:19,665 --> 01:07:23,092
But I can't exactly tell who
or what I saw on that footage.

713
01:07:30,396 --> 01:07:33,909
In the past few days I was
rummaging through old papers

714
01:07:33,910 --> 01:07:35,932
when I found one of Jacob's works.

715
01:07:39,587 --> 01:07:41,930
It was about a man

716
01:07:41,931 --> 01:07:45,042
who meets himself and...

717
01:07:46,277 --> 01:07:47,817
and witnesses his own death.

718
01:07:53,115 --> 01:07:56,535
It's kind of strange,
because he didn't complete it

719
01:07:58,428 --> 01:08:03,258
but its title is very expressive.

720
01:08:13,608 --> 01:08:14,921
Deep inside

721
01:08:15,982 --> 01:08:21,015
I sense that Jacob wasn't led
to that place by his decisions.

722
01:08:22,578 --> 01:08:24,356
It was something else.

723
01:08:26,875 --> 01:08:28,706
And it wasn't by chance that

724
01:08:29,872 --> 01:08:33,771
he sensed and provoked the
things we saw on the footage.

725
01:08:37,256 --> 01:08:42,170
Maybe it was due to his
condition and that they

726
01:08:42,171 --> 01:08:44,469
thought he could help them.

727
01:08:45,877 --> 01:08:48,269
I know it sounds crazy.

728
01:08:56,577 --> 01:09:04,577
I don't know if Jacob saw or
felt his own death approaching

729
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:12,443
but I don't want to

730
01:09:16,540 --> 01:09:19,403
and I cannot accept the unacceptable yet.

731
01:09:26,765 --> 01:09:29,066
We always strive for the better.

732
01:09:31,504 --> 01:09:33,381
This is who we are as humans.

733
01:09:41,823 --> 01:09:43,273
But in the end

734
01:09:44,884 --> 01:09:49,197
we only left alone with the
choices we blame ourselves for.

735
01:09:52,517 --> 01:09:55,100
I really want him to come home to me.

736
01:09:56,986 --> 01:09:58,071
I loved my brother.

737
01:10:01,108 --> 01:10:02,191
And he loved me.

738
01:10:05,350 --> 01:10:06,797
He loved Kim as well.

739
01:10:13,219 --> 01:10:14,630
If he was still alive

740
01:10:16,991 --> 01:10:18,073
he would be here with us.

741
01:10:28,267 --> 01:10:31,219
There's only one thing left
that I don't understand.

742
01:10:32,370 --> 01:10:35,784
How did you know that particular
night that Jacob needed help?

743
01:10:41,309 --> 01:10:45,209
I received a...

744
01:10:45,210 --> 01:10:48,446
text message

745
01:10:48,447 --> 01:10:52,673
telling me to help him immediately

746
01:10:52,674 --> 01:10:54,501
that he needed his brother.

747
01:10:56,089 --> 01:10:57,589
Who sent the message?

748
01:11:00,297 --> 01:11:04,607
The message arrived at 12:26 AM

749
01:11:04,608 --> 01:11:06,182
from my mother's phone.

750
01:11:07,739 --> 01:11:12,059
But she was lying in come
in the hospital, wasn't she?

751
01:11:13,377 --> 01:11:16,076
The doctor's report lists

752
01:11:16,077 --> 01:11:19,402
time of death at 12:15 AM.

753
01:11:21,039 --> 01:11:22,777
How is it possible?

754
01:11:27,596 --> 01:11:29,451
Will you excuse me for a minute?

755
01:11:33,831 --> 01:11:39,659
Even though we have the recordings and the investigative
materials, we can't say anything for certain

756
01:11:39,660 --> 01:11:43,718
nor can we give a reasonable
explanation for all that happened.

757
01:11:43,719 --> 01:11:47,194
This whole case is surreal.

758
01:11:47,195 --> 01:11:50,570
That includes the disappearance of Jacob
Taylor and the death of his mother.

759
01:11:51,733 --> 01:11:55,860
The events are there for everyone to see,
but we don't know what they mean.

760
01:11:56,898 --> 01:11:59,753
But that doesn't make them any less real.

761
01:12:10,243 --> 01:12:12,773
And they are waiting to be solved.

762
01:12:30,416 --> 01:12:33,882
But first we need to clarify
a very important question.

763
01:12:40,007 --> 01:12:42,776
Where is Jacob Taylor?
