- We will have that in hiding them. - We will have persecutors.

00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:24,060 
Sabem which the biggest cause of
persecutors? The esquecimento.

95
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,920 
Esquecimento!

96

98
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:36,460 
Li on this woman, who costumava to walk
inside of its house...

00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:40,360
... bare one, of lighted light. Curtains
all opening.

100
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:45,000 
It always forgot to close them because
it gave direct for a forest.

101
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,600 
Nobody is, certain there?

102
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,600 
But had...

103
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:57,100
... this persecuting face, only looked at
it to pass every day for the windows.

104
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:03,580 
It started to think that it did not
close because she wanted to be seen...

105
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,680
... that it was inviting it it to enter.

106
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,400 
Then it started to imagine everything as
a relationship with it.

107
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,080
 Criou a small fancy when it was hanging
its clothes...

Finally it force the entrance.

00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,840 
When it finds it, find a stranger.

112
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,000 
It finds it stranger because it is
terrified and orders it pra is of the house.

113
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,140 
It finds that it only is only if making
of difficult of new. Then it decides to act...

114
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:48,680
... raping and strangling to hinder it to
cry out.

115
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,030

Vocês do not have that to be worried.

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:13,740
... that it adored. It entered hidden in
the school in its knapsack.

216
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:21,160 
One day, I changed the good looking one

"Aréa without cameras". "1 person in

00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:41,640 
Already had been asked as the company
plans in paying them?

542
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:46,271 
Already had thought as they pay for this
house, food and for the cursed helicopter?

543
00:58:46,271 --> 00:58:48,760
- Propagandas of the site. 
- ñ ÿ ¿(Taxes of Registrations.

544
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:52,032 
Certainty, you do not have one, if it
will not have the other, certain?

545
00:58:52,220 --> 00:58:54,840 
Quero to say, if nobody to enroll
itself, they will not have money.

546
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:58,180 
and I was thinking, this face, the
Travis...

547
00:58:58,180 --> 00:59:01,340
... it were one cursed programmer of the
InterNet.

548
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:07,480 
It had to pass its cursed life in the
InterNet, then as it never had seen a fodida propaganda?

549
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:09,100 
Have tons of excrement in the InterNet.

550
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:10,100 
Are, certain.

551
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:14,160
- Therefore it wanted to enter in the InterNet. 
- How it entered in
the InterNet?

552
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:17,000 
This localizer have one link with the
satellite that functions.

553
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:19,460
- Where it learned this? 
- Club of the computer.

554
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:22,681 
Estive looking for for the site,
certain? I made a research...

555
00:59:22,681 --> 00:59:27,920
... in all the sites of existing searches
that I could remember and I did not find nothing...

556
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:32,720
... I want to say, nothing exactly, not
even a propaganda.

557
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:37,260
- Nothing. Nor one cursed propaganda. 
- the InterNet is a great place.

558
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:42,120 
Are a great place, but I want to know
because it is being so difficult to find a site...

559
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:45,660
... I want to say, if they want that the
people visit the site, because she would be so difficult?

560
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:50,980 
Good, I found, I was difficult pra
devil, but I found.

561
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:54,147 
Are, but it is fodido, wants to say,
does not have a name...

562
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:56,680
... are one cursed type of site base.

563
00:59:56,800 --> 01:00:00,200 
Are a trip of hackers. It is as a code
made for one cursed group of hackers

564
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:03,400
- What it means a site base? 
- a site base is one...

565
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:10,060
... are as a password, one bagunça
fodida of letters and numbers in time of the real name. 
It is fodido!

566
01:00:10,420 --> 01:00:12,160 V
ejam alone!

567
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:15,060
- This is our site? 
- I do not know.

568
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:17,760 
Quero to say, I do not know. I am trying
to inscribe me, but I am using...

569
01:00:17,760 --> the 01:00:21,120
... credit card of the Travis, but do
not have credit for 50 a thousand dollars.

570
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:25,420
- How it knows that he is 50 a thousand? 
- I learned many things in
the Club of the Computer.

571
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:26,800 
I can ask pra that?

572
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:31,080 
Are, but without the 50 a thousand
dollars, we will not arrive at the fodida password of the site.

573
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:34,020
- I do not understand. 
- I also do not understand.

574
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:38,460 
I also do not understand. This place
does not have a fodida propaganda.

575
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:41,288 
It nor has a real address.

576
01:00:41,288 --> 01:00:46,360 
Then, I cannot understand. The only
thing that I can imagine is that they do not want to call the
attention.

577
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:50,320 
But because this? E the security,
excrement, the security...

578
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:54,420
... are insane. Already I passed all the
archives of hacker that I have in this thing...

579
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:58,320
... and we are speaking of serious
decoders of passwords.

580
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:00,940 
and I continue not obtaining to pass for
the password.

581
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:02,980 
Then which its point of view, Rex?

582
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:05,000 
My point of view...

583
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:13,180
... my simple point of view are why
devils somebody would pay to as much money pra in seeing them?

584
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:19,000 
I want to know if this fodida thing is
regularized. This excrement is legal?

585
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,480 
As a site pornô?

586
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:24,100 A
re, as a site pornô, but except for
it, we did not make nothing pra this to seem a fodido site pornô.

587
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:26,900 
Then what it is? What?

588
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:31,280 
I am the only person who thinks for
here?

589
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:34,280 
Quero to say, I am the only person. He
is only clearly pra me?

590
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:39,720 
Nobody heard to speak before of a film
of real murder...

591
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:41,520
... I want to say, Dany already is
died...

592
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:43,440
... are alone to join the things. - Not,
Dany if killed!

593
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:45,740 
As we can be certain?

594
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:48,080

599
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:18,760
- Died or not.
- Oh, my God!

600
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:20,560

606
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:26,082
- He calms myself, calms myself! 
... they had killed Dany and now they

607
01:03:26,082 --> 01:03:29,120 
Relax. This is not a site of murder.
